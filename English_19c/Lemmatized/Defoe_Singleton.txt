the
LIFE
,
adventures
,
and
piracy
of
CAPTAIN
SINGLETON
 
as
it
be
usual
for
great
person
,
whose
life
have
be
remarkable
,
and
whose
action
deserve
recording
to
posterity
,
to
insist
much
upon
their
original
,
give
full
account
of
their
family
,
and
the
history
of
their
ancestor
,
so
,
that
I
may
be
methodical
<EOS>
,
I
shall
do
the
same
,
though
I
can
look
but
a
very
little
way
into
my
pedigree
,
as
you
will
see
presently
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
may
believe
the
woman
whom
I
be
teach
to
call
mother
,
I
be
a
little
boy
,
of
about
two
year
old
,
very
well
dressed
,
have
a
nursery
-
maid
to
attend
me
,
who
take
me
out
on
a
fine
summer
's
evening
into
the
field
towards
Islington
,
as
she
pretend
,
to
give
the
child
some
air
;
a
little
girl
be
with
her
,
of
twelve
or
fourteen
year
old
,
that
live
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
the
maid
,
whether
by
appointment
or
otherwise
,
meet
with
a
fellow
,
her
sweetheart
,
as
I
suppose
;
he
carry
her
into
a
public
-
house
,
to
give
her
a
pot
and
a
cake
;
and
while
they
be
toy
in
the
house
the
girl
play
about
,
with
me
in
her
hand
,
in
the
garden
and
at
the
door
,
sometimes
in
sight
,
sometimes
out
of
sight
,
think
no
harm
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
come
by
one
of
those
sort
of
people
who
,
it
seem
,
make
it
their
business
to
spirit
away
little
child
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
hellish
trade
in
those
day
,
and
chiefly
practise
where
they
find
little
child
very
well
dressed
,
or
for
big
child
,
to
sell
them
to
the
plantation
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
,
pretend
to
take
me
up
in
her
arm
and
kiss
me
,
and
play
with
me
,
draw
the
girl
a
good
way
from
the
house
,
till
at
last
she
make
a
fine
story
to
the
girl
,
and
bid
her
go
back
to
the
maid
,
and
tell
her
where
she
be
with
the
child
;
that
a
gentlewoman
have
take
a
fancy
to
the
child
,
and
be
kiss
of
it
,
but
she
should
not
be
fright
,
or
to
that
purpose
;
for
they
be
but
just
there
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
while
the
girl
go
,
she
carry
me
quite
away
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
time
,
it
seem
,
I
be
dispose
of
to
a
beggar
woman
that
want
a
pretty
little
child
to
set
out
her
case
;
and
after
that
,
to
a
gipsy
,
under
whose
government
<EOS>
I
continue
till
I
be
about
six
year
old
.
<EOS>
and
this
woman
,
though
I
be
continually
drag
about
with
her
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
,
yet
never
let
me
want
for
anything
;
and
I
call
her
mother
;
though
she
tell
me
at
last
she
be
not
my
mother
,
but
that
she
buy
me
for
twelve
shilling
of
another
woman
,
who
tell
her
how
she
come
by
me
,
and
tell
her
that
my
name
be
Bob
Singleton
,
not
Robert
,
but
plain
Bob
;
for
it
seem
they
never
know
by
what
name
I
be
christen
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
reflect
here
,
what
a
terrible
fright
<EOS>
the
careless
hussy
be
in
that
lose
me
;
what
treatment
she
receive
from
my
justly
enraged
father
and
mother
,
and
the
horror
these
must
be
in
at
the
thought
of
their
child
be
thus
carry
away
;
for
as
I
never
know
anything
of
the
matter
,
but
just
what
I
have
relate
,
nor
who
my
father
and
mother
be
,
so
it
would
make
but
a
needless
digression
to
talk
of
it
here
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
gipsy
mother
,
for
some
of
her
worthy
action
no
doubt
,
happen
in
process
of
time
to
be
hang
;
and
as
this
fall
out
something
too
soon
for
me
to
be
perfect
in
the
stroll
trade
,
the
parish
where
I
be
leave
,
which
for
my
life
I
can
not
remember
,
take
some
care
of
me
,
to
be
sure
;
for
the
first
thing
I
can
remember
of
myself
afterwards
,
be
,
that
I
go
to
a
parish
school
,
and
the
minister
of
the
parish
use
to
talk
to
me
to
be
a
good
boy
;
and
that
,
though
I
be
but
a
poor
boy
,
if
I
mind
my
book
,
and
serve
God
,
I
may
make
a
good
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
frequently
remove
from
one
town
to
another
,
perhaps
as
the
parish
dispute
my
suppose
mother
's
last
settlement
.
<EOS>
whether
I
be
so
shift
by
pass
,
or
otherwise
,
I
know
not
;
but
the
town
where
I
last
be
keep
,
whatever
its
name
be
,
must
be
not
far
off
from
the
seaside
;
for
a
master
of
a
ship
who
take
a
fancy
to
me
,
be
the
first
that
bring
me
to
a
place
not
far
from
Southampton
,
which
I
afterwards
know
to
be
Bussleton
;
and
there
I
attend
the
carpenter
,
and
such
people
as
be
employ
in
build
a
ship
for
him
;
and
when
it
be
do
,
though
I
be
not
above
twelve
year
old
,
he
carry
me
to
sea
with
him
on
a
voyage
to
Newfoundland
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
well
enough
,
and
please
my
master
so
well
that
he
call
me
his
own
boy
;
and
I
would
have
call
him
father
,
but
he
would
not
allow
it
,
for
he
have
child
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
go
three
or
four
voyage
with
him
,
and
grow
a
great
sturdy
boy
,
when
,
come
home
again
from
the
bank
of
Newfoundland
,
we
be
take
by
an
Algerine
rover
,
or
man
-
of
-
war
;
which
,
if
my
account
stand
right
,
be
about
the
year
1695
,
for
you
may
be
sure
I
keep
no
journal
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
much
concerned
at
the
disaster
,
though
I
see
my
master
,
after
have
be
wound
by
a
splinter
in
the
head
during
the
engagement
,
very
barbarously
use
by
the
Turks
;
I
say
,
I
be
not
much
concerned
,
till
,
upon
some
unlucky
thing
I
say
,
which
,
as
I
remember
,
be
about
abuse
my
master
,
they
take
me
and
beat
me
most
unmercifully
with
a
flat
stick
on
the
sol
of
my
foot
,
so
that
I
could
neither
go
or
stand
for
several
day
together
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
good
fortune
be
my
friend
upon
this
occasion
;
for
,
as
they
be
sail
away
with
our
ship
in
tow
as
a
prize
,
steer
for
the
Straits
,
and
in
sight
of
the
bay
of
Cadiz
,
the
turkish
rover
be
attack
by
two
great
portuguese
man
-
of
-
war
,
and
take
and
carry
into
Lisbon
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
not
much
concerned
at
my
captivity
,
not
indeed
understand
the
consequence
of
it
,
if
it
have
continue
,
so
I
be
not
suitably
sensible
of
my
deliverance
;
nor
,
indeed
,
be
it
so
much
a
deliverance
to
me
as
it
would
otherwise
have
be
,
for
my
master
,
who
be
the
only
friend
I
have
in
the
world
,
die
at
Lisbon
of
his
wound
;
and
I
be
then
almost
reduce
to
my
primitive
state
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
of
starve
,
have
this
addition
to
it
,
that
it
be
in
a
foreign
country
too
,
where
I
know
nobody
and
could
not
speak
a
word
of
their
language
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
fare
better
here
than
I
have
reason
to
expect
;
for
when
all
the
rest
of
our
man
have
their
liberty
to
go
where
they
would
,
I
,
that
know
not
whither
to
go
,
stay
in
the
ship
for
several
day
,
till
at
length
one
of
the
lieutenant
see
me
,
inquire
what
that
young
english
dog
do
there
,
and
why
they
do
not
turn
him
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
him
,
and
partly
understand
what
he
mean
,
though
not
what
he
say
,
and
begin
then
to
be
in
a
terrible
fright
;
for
I
know
not
where
to
get
a
bit
of
bread
;
when
the
pilot
of
the
ship
,
an
old
seaman
,
see
me
look
very
dull
,
come
to
me
,
and
speak
break
English
to
me
,
tell
me
I
must
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
whither
must
I
go
?
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
where
you
will
,
"
say
he
,
"
home
to
your
own
country
,
if
you
will
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
must
I
go
thither
?
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
why
,
have
you
no
friend
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
not
in
the
world
,
but
that
dog
,
"
point
to
the
ship
's
dog
(
who
,
have
steal
a
piece
of
meat
just
before
,
have
bring
it
close
by
me
,
and
I
have
take
it
from
him
,
and
eat
it
)
,
"
<EOS>
for
he
have
be
a
good
friend
,
and
bring
me
my
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
must
have
your
dinner
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
"
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
old
pilot
take
me
home
with
him
,
and
use
me
tolerably
well
,
though
I
fare
hard
enough
;
and
I
live
with
him
about
two
year
,
during
which
time
he
be
solicit
his
business
,
and
at
length
get
to
be
master
or
pilot
under
Don
Garcia
de
Pimentesia
de
Carravallas
,
captain
of
a
portuguese
galleon
or
carrack
,
which
be
bind
to
Goa
,
in
the
East
Indies
;
and
immediately
have
get
his
commission
,
put
me
on
board
to
look
after
his
cabin
,
in
which
he
have
store
himself
with
abundance
of
liquor
,
succade
,
sugar
,
spice
,
and
other
thing
,
for
his
accommodation
in
the
voyage
,
and
lay
in
afterwards
a
considerable
quantity
of
european
good
,
fine
lace
and
linen
;
and
also
baize
,
woollen
cloth
,
stuff
,
&
c.
,
under
the
pretence
of
his
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
too
young
in
the
trade
to
keep
any
journal
of
this
voyage
,
though
my
master
,
who
be
,
for
a
Portuguese
,
a
pretty
good
artist
,
prompt
me
to
it
;
but
my
not
understand
the
language
be
one
hindrance
;
at
least
it
serve
me
for
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
however
,
after
some
time
,
I
begin
to
look
into
his
chart
and
book
;
and
,
as
I
could
write
a
tolerable
hand
,
understand
some
Latin
,
and
begin
to
have
a
little
smattering
of
the
portuguese
tongue
,
so
I
begin
to
get
a
superficial
knowledge
of
navigation
,
but
not
such
as
be
likely
to
be
sufficient
to
carry
me
through
a
life
of
adventure
,
as
mine
be
to
be
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
learn
several
material
thing
in
this
voyage
among
the
Portuguese
;
I
learn
particularly
to
be
an
arrant
thief
and
a
bad
sailor
;
and
I
think
I
may
say
they
be
the
good
master
for
teach
both
these
of
any
nation
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
We
make
our
way
for
the
East
Indies
,
by
the
coast
of
Brazil
;
not
that
it
be
in
the
course
of
sail
the
way
thither
,
but
our
captain
,
either
on
his
own
account
,
or
by
the
direction
of
the
merchant
,
go
thither
first
,
where
at
all
Saints
'
Bay
,
or
,
as
they
call
it
in
Portugal
,
the
Rio
de
Todos
los
Santos
,
we
deliver
near
a
hundred
ton
of
good
,
and
take
in
a
considerable
quantity
of
gold
,
with
some
chest
of
sugar
,
and
seventy
or
eighty
great
roll
of
tobacco
,
every
roll
weighing
at
least
a
hundredweight
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
be
lodge
on
shore
by
my
master
's
order
,
I
have
the
charge
of
the
captain
's
business
,
he
have
see
me
very
diligent
for
my
own
master
;
and
in
requital
for
his
mistaken
confidence
<EOS>
,
I
find
mean
to
secure
,
that
be
to
say
,
to
steal
,
about
twenty
moidore
out
of
the
gold
that
be
ship
on
board
by
the
merchant
,
and
this
be
my
first
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
tolerable
voyage
from
hence
to
the
Cape
de
Bona
Speranza
;
and
I
be
repute
as
a
mighty
diligent
servant
to
my
master
,
and
very
faithful
.
<EOS>
I
be
diligent
indeed
,
but
I
be
very
far
from
honest
;
however
,
they
think
me
honest
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
their
very
great
mistake
.
<EOS>
upon
this
very
mistake
the
captain
take
a
particular
liking
to
me
,
and
employ
me
frequently
on
his
own
occasion
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
in
recompense
for
my
officious
diligence
,
I
receive
several
particular
favour
from
him
;
particularly
,
I
be
,
by
the
captain
's
command
,
make
a
kind
of
a
steward
under
the
ship
's
steward
,
for
such
provision
as
the
captain
demand
for
his
own
table
.
<EOS>
He
have
another
steward
for
his
private
store
besides
,
but
my
office
concern
only
what
the
captain
call
for
of
the
ship
's
store
for
his
private
use
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
by
this
mean
I
have
opportunity
particularly
to
take
care
of
my
master
's
man
,
and
to
furnish
myself
with
sufficient
provision
to
make
me
live
much
better
than
the
other
people
in
the
ship
;
for
the
captain
seldom
order
anything
out
of
the
ship
's
store
,
as
above
,
but
I
snipt
some
of
it
for
my
own
share
.
<EOS>
We
arrive
at
Goa
,
in
the
East
Indies
,
in
about
seven
month
from
Lisbon
,
and
remain
there
eight
more
;
during
which
time
I
have
indeed
nothing
to
do
,
my
master
be
generally
on
shore
,
but
to
learn
everything
that
be
wicked
among
the
Portuguese
,
a
nation
the
most
perfidious
and
the
most
debauch
,
the
most
insolent
and
cruel
,
of
any
that
pretend
to
call
themselves
Christians
,
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
thieving
,
lying
,
swear
,
forswearing
,
join
to
the
most
abominable
lewdness
,
be
the
stated
practice
of
the
ship
's
crew
;
add
to
it
,
that
,
with
the
most
insufferable
boast
of
their
own
courage
,
they
be
,
generally
speak
,
the
most
complete
coward
that
I
ever
meet
with
;
and
the
consequence
of
their
cowardice
be
evident
upon
many
occasion
.
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
here
<EOS>
and
there
one
among
them
<EOS>
that
be
not
so
bad
as
the
rest
;
and
,
as
my
lot
fall
among
them
,
it
make
me
have
the
most
contemptible
thought
of
the
rest
,
as
indeed
they
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
exactly
fit
for
their
society
indeed
;
for
I
have
no
sense
of
virtue
or
religion
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
much
of
either
,
except
what
a
good
old
parson
have
say
to
me
when
I
be
a
child
of
about
eight
or
nine
year
old
;
nay
,
I
be
prepare
and
grow
up
apace
to
be
as
wicked
as
anybody
could
be
,
or
perhaps
ever
be
.
<EOS>
fate
certainly
thus
direct
my
beginning
,
know
that
I
have
work
which
I
have
to
do
in
the
world
,
which
nothing
but
one
harden
against
all
sense
of
honesty
or
religion
could
go
through
;
and
yet
,
even
in
this
state
of
original
wickedness
<EOS>
,
I
entertain
such
a
settle
abhorrence
of
the
abandon
vileness
of
the
Portuguese
,
that
I
could
not
but
hate
them
most
heartily
from
the
beginning
,
and
all
my
life
afterwards
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
brutishly
wicked
,
so
base
and
perfidious
,
not
only
to
stranger
but
to
one
another
,
<EOS>
so
meanly
submissive
when
subject
,
so
insolent
,
or
barbarous
and
tyrannical
,
when
superior
,
that
I
think
there
be
something
in
them
that
shock
my
very
nature
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
that
it
be
natural
to
an
Englishman
to
hate
a
coward
,
it
all
join
together
to
make
the
devil
and
a
Portuguese
equally
my
aversion
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
accord
to
the
english
proverb
,
he
that
be
ship
with
the
devil
must
sail
with
the
devil
;
I
be
among
them
,
and
I
manage
myself
as
well
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
My
master
have
consent
that
I
should
assist
the
captain
in
the
office
,
as
above
;
but
,
as
I
understand
afterwards
that
the
captain
allow
my
master
half
a
moidore
a
month
for
my
service
,
and
that
he
have
my
name
upon
the
ship
's
book
also
<EOS>
,
I
expect
that
when
the
ship
come
to
be
pay
four
month
'
wage
at
the
Indies
,
as
they
,
it
seem
,
always
do
,
my
master
would
let
me
have
something
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
wrong
in
my
man
,
for
he
be
none
of
that
kind
;
he
have
take
me
up
as
in
distress
,
and
his
business
be
to
keep
me
so
,
and
make
his
market
of
me
as
well
as
he
could
,
which
I
begin
to
think
of
after
a
different
manner
than
I
do
at
first
,
for
at
first
<EOS>
I
think
he
have
entertain
me
in
mere
charity
,
upon
see
my
distressed
circumstance
,
but
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
when
he
put
me
on
board
the
ship
,
I
should
have
some
wage
for
my
service
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
think
,
it
seem
,
quite
otherwise
;
<EOS>
and
when
I
procure
one
to
speak
to
him
about
it
,
when
the
ship
be
pay
at
Goa
,
he
fly
into
the
great
rage
imaginable
,
and
call
me
english
dog
,
young
heretic
,
and
threaten
to
put
me
into
the
inquisition
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
of
all
the
name
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
letter
could
make
up
,
he
should
not
have
call
me
heretic
;
for
as
I
know
nothing
about
religion
,
neither
Protestant
from
Papist
,
or
either
of
them
from
a
Mahometan
,
I
could
never
be
a
heretic
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
pass
but
a
little
,
but
,
as
young
as
I
be
,
I
have
be
carry
into
the
inquisition
,
and
there
,
if
they
have
ask
me
if
I
be
a
Protestant
or
a
Catholic
,
I
should
have
say
yes
to
that
which
come
first
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
the
Protestant
they
have
ask
first
,
it
have
certainly
make
a
martyr
of
me
for
I
do
not
know
what
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
very
priest
they
carry
with
them
,
or
chaplain
of
the
ship
,
as
we
call
him
,
save
me
;
for
see
me
a
boy
entirely
ignorant
of
religion
,
and
ready
to
do
or
say
anything
they
bid
me
,
he
ask
me
some
question
about
it
,
which
he
find
I
answer
so
very
simply
,
that
he
take
it
upon
him
to
tell
them
he
would
answer
for
my
be
a
good
Catholic
,
and
he
hope
he
should
be
the
mean
of
save
my
soul
,
and
he
please
himself
that
it
be
to
be
a
work
of
merit
to
him
;
so
he
make
me
as
good
a
Papist
as
any
of
them
in
about
a
week
's
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
tell
him
my
case
about
my
master
;
how
,
it
be
true
,
he
have
take
me
up
in
a
miserable
case
on
board
a
man
-
of
-
war
at
Lisbon
;
and
I
be
indebted
to
him
for
bring
me
on
board
this
ship
;
that
if
I
have
be
leave
at
Lisbon
,
I
may
have
starve
,
and
the
like
;
and
therefore
I
be
willing
to
serve
him
,
but
that
I
hope
he
would
give
me
some
little
consideration
for
my
service
,
or
let
me
know
how
long
he
expect
I
should
serve
him
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
;
neither
the
priest
nor
any
one
else
could
prevail
with
him
,
but
that
I
be
not
his
servant
but
his
slave
,
that
he
take
me
in
the
Algerine
,
and
that
I
be
a
Turk
,
only
pretend
to
be
an
english
boy
to
get
my
liberty
,
and
he
would
carry
me
to
the
Inquisition
as
a
Turk
.
  
<EOS>
this
fright
me
out
of
my
wit
,
for
I
have
nobody
to
vouch
for
me
<EOS>
what
I
be
,
or
from
whence
I
come
;
but
the
good
Padre
Antonio
,
for
that
be
his
name
,
clear
me
of
that
part
by
a
way
I
do
not
understand
;
for
he
come
to
me
one
morning
with
two
sailor
,
and
tell
me
they
must
search
me
,
to
bear
witness
that
I
be
not
a
Turk
.
<EOS>
I
be
amazed
at
them
,
and
fright
,
and
do
not
understand
them
,
nor
could
I
imagine
what
they
intend
to
do
to
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
strip
me
,
they
be
soon
satisfied
,
and
Father
Antony
bid
me
be
easy
,
<EOS>
for
they
could
all
witness
that
I
be
no
Turk
.
<EOS>
so
I
escape
that
part
of
my
master
's
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
resolve
from
that
time
to
run
away
from
him
if
I
could
,
but
there
be
no
doing
of
it
there
,
for
there
be
not
ship
of
any
nation
in
the
world
in
that
port
,
except
two
or
three
persian
vessel
from
Ormus
,
so
that
if
I
have
offer
to
go
away
from
him
,
he
would
have
have
me
seize
on
shore
,
and
bring
on
board
by
force
;
so
that
I
have
no
remedy
but
patience
.
<EOS>
and
this
he
bring
to
an
end
too
as
soon
as
he
could
,
for
after
this
he
begin
to
use
me
ill
,
and
not
only
to
straiten
my
provision
,
but
to
beat
and
torture
me
in
a
barbarous
manner
for
every
trifle
,
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
my
life
begin
to
be
very
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
the
violence
of
this
usage
of
me
,
and
the
impossibility
of
my
escape
from
his
hand
,
set
my
head
a
-
working
upon
all
sort
of
mischief
,
and
in
particular
I
resolve
,
after
study
all
other
way
to
deliver
myself
,
and
find
all
ineffectual
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
I
resolve
to
murder
him
.
<EOS>
with
this
hellish
resolution
in
my
head
,
I
spend
whole
night
and
day
contrive
how
to
put
it
in
execution
,
the
devil
prompt
me
very
warmly
to
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
entirely
at
a
loss
for
the
mean
,
for
I
have
neither
gun
or
sword
,
nor
any
weapon
to
assault
him
with
;
poison
I
have
my
thought
much
upon
,
but
know
not
where
to
get
any
;
or
,
if
I
may
have
get
it
,
I
do
not
know
the
country
word
for
it
,
or
by
what
name
to
ask
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
I
quit
the
fact
,
intentionally
,
a
hundred
and
a
hundred
time
;
but
Providence
,
either
for
his
sake
or
for
mine
,
always
frustrate
my
design
,
and
I
could
never
bring
it
to
pass
;
so
I
be
oblige
to
continue
in
his
chain
till
the
ship
,
have
take
in
her
loading
,
set
sail
for
Portugal
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
say
nothing
here
to
the
manner
of
our
voyage
,
for
,
as
I
say
,
I
keep
no
journal
;
but
this
I
can
give
an
account
of
,
that
have
be
once
as
high
as
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
as
we
call
it
,
or
Cabo
de
Bona
Speranza
,
as
they
call
it
,
we
be
drive
back
again
by
a
violent
storm
from
the
W.S.W.
,
which
hold
us
six
day
and
night
a
great
way
to
the
eastward
,
and
after
that
,
stand
afore
the
wind
for
several
day
more
,
we
at
last
come
to
an
anchor
on
the
coast
of
Madagascar
.
  
<EOS>
the
storm
have
be
so
violent
that
the
ship
have
receive
a
great
deal
of
damage
,
and
it
require
some
time
to
repair
her
;
so
,
stand
in
nearer
the
shore
,
the
pilot
,
my
master
,
bring
the
ship
into
a
very
good
harbour
,
where
we
rid
in
twenty
-
six
fathom
water
,
about
half
a
mile
from
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
ship
ride
here
there
happen
a
most
desperate
mutiny
among
the
man
,
upon
account
of
some
deficiency
in
their
allowance
,
which
come
to
that
height
that
they
threaten
the
captain
to
set
him
on
shore
,
and
go
back
with
the
ship
to
Goa
.
<EOS>
I
wish
they
would
with
all
my
heart
,
for
I
be
full
of
mischief
in
my
head
,
and
ready
enough
to
do
any
.
<EOS>
so
,
though
I
be
but
<EOS>
a
boy
,
as
they
call
me
,
yet
I
prompt
the
mischief
all
I
could
,
and
embark
in
it
so
openly
,
that
I
escape
very
little
be
hang
in
the
first
and
most
early
part
of
my
life
;
for
the
captain
have
some
notice
that
there
be
a
design
lay
by
some
of
the
company
to
murder
him
;
and
have
,
partly
by
money
and
promise
,
and
partly
by
threaten
and
torture
,
bring
two
fellow
to
confess
the
particular
,
and
the
name
of
the
person
concern
,
they
be
presently
apprehend
,
till
,
one
accuse
another
,
no
less
than
sixteen
man
be
seize
and
put
into
iron
,
whereof
I
be
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
,
who
be
make
desperate
by
his
danger
,
resolve
to
clear
the
ship
of
his
enemy
,
try
us
all
,
and
we
be
all
condemn
to
die
.
<EOS>
the
manner
of
his
process
I
be
too
young
to
take
notice
of
;
but
the
purser
and
one
of
the
gunner
be
hang
immediately
,
and
I
expect
it
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
any
great
concern
I
be
under
about
it
,
only
that
I
cry
very
much
,
for
I
know
little
then
of
this
world
,
and
nothing
at
all
of
the
next
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
captain
content
himself
with
execute
these
two
,
and
some
of
the
rest
,
upon
their
humble
submission
and
promise
of
future
good
behaviour
,
be
pardon
;
but
five
be
order
to
be
set
on
shore
on
the
island
and
leave
there
,
of
which
I
be
one
.
<EOS>
My
master
use
all
his
interest
with
the
captain
to
have
me
excuse
,
but
could
not
obtain
it
;
for
somebody
have
tell
him
that
I
be
one
of
them
who
be
single
out
to
have
kill
him
,
<EOS>
when
my
master
desire
I
may
not
be
set
on
shore
,
the
captain
tell
him
I
should
stay
on
board
if
he
desire
it
,
but
then
I
should
be
hang
,
so
he
may
choose
for
me
which
he
think
best
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
it
seem
,
be
particularly
provoke
at
my
be
concern
in
the
treachery
,
because
of
his
have
be
so
kind
to
me
,
and
of
his
have
single
me
out
to
serve
him
,
as
I
have
say
above
;
and
this
,
perhaps
,
oblige
him
to
give
my
master
such
a
rough
choice
,
either
to
set
me
on
shore
or
to
have
me
hang
on
board
.
<EOS>
and
have
my
master
,
indeed
,
know
what
good
-
will
I
have
for
him
,
he
would
not
have
be
long
in
choose
for
me
;
for
I
have
certainly
determine
to
do
him
a
mischief
the
first
opportunity
I
have
for
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
therefore
,
a
good
providence
for
me
to
keep
me
from
dip
my
hand
in
blood
,
and
it
make
me
more
tender
afterwards
in
matter
of
blood
than
I
believe
I
should
otherwise
have
be
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
my
be
one
of
them
that
be
to
kill
the
captain
,
that
I
be
wrong
in
,
for
I
be
not
the
person
,
but
it
be
really
one
of
them
that
be
pardon
,
he
have
the
good
luck
not
to
have
that
part
discover
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
to
enter
upon
a
part
of
independent
life
,
a
thing
I
be
indeed
very
ill
prepared
to
manage
,
for
I
be
perfectly
loose
and
dissolute
in
my
behaviour
,
bold
and
wicked
while
I
be
under
government
,
and
now
perfectly
unfit
to
be
trust
with
liberty
,
for
I
be
as
ripe
for
any
villainy
as
a
young
fellow
that
have
no
solid
thought
ever
place
in
his
mind
could
be
suppose
to
be
.
<EOS>
education
,
as
you
have
hear
,
I
have
none
;
and
all
the
little
scene
of
life
I
have
pass
through
have
be
full
of
danger
and
desperate
circumstance
;
but
I
be
either
so
young
or
so
stupid
,
that
I
escape
the
grief
and
anxiety
of
them
,
for
want
of
have
a
sense
of
their
tendency
and
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
this
thoughtless
,
unconcerned
temper
have
one
felicity
indeed
in
it
,
that
it
make
me
daring
and
ready
for
do
any
mischief
,
and
keep
off
the
sorrow
which
otherwise
ought
to
have
attend
me
when
I
fall
into
any
mischief
;
that
this
stupidity
be
instead
of
a
happiness
to
me
,
for
it
leave
my
thought
free
to
act
upon
mean
of
escape
and
deliverance
in
my
distress
,
however
great
it
may
be
;
whereas
my
companion
in
the
misery
be
so
sink
by
their
fear
and
grief
,
that
they
abandon
themselves
to
the
misery
of
their
condition
,
and
give
over
all
think
but
of
their
perishing
and
starve
,
be
devour
by
wild
beast
,
murder
,
and
perhaps
eat
by
cannibal
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
but
a
young
fellow
,
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
;
but
hear
what
be
to
be
my
fate
,
I
receive
it
with
no
appearance
of
discouragement
;
but
I
ask
what
my
master
say
to
it
,
and
be
tell
that
he
have
use
his
utmost
interest
to
save
me
,
but
the
captain
have
answer
I
should
either
go
on
shore
or
be
hang
on
board
,
which
he
please
,
I
then
give
over
all
hope
of
be
receive
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
very
thankful
in
my
thought
to
my
master
for
his
soliciting
the
captain
for
me
,
because
I
know
that
what
he
do
be
not
in
kindness
to
me
so
much
as
in
kindness
to
himself
;
I
mean
,
to
preserve
the
wage
which
he
get
for
me
,
which
amount
to
above
six
dollar
a
month
,
include
what
the
captain
allow
him
for
my
particular
service
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
understand
that
my
master
be
so
apparently
kind
,
I
ask
if
I
may
not
be
admit
to
speak
with
him
,
and
they
tell
me
I
may
,
if
my
master
would
come
down
to
me
,
but
I
could
not
be
allow
to
come
up
to
him
;
<EOS>
so
then
I
desire
my
master
may
be
speak
to
to
come
to
me
,
and
he
accordingly
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
fall
on
my
knee
to
him
,
and
beg
he
would
forgive
me
what
I
have
do
to
displease
him
;
and
indeed
the
resolution
I
have
take
to
murder
him
lie
with
some
horror
upon
my
mind
just
at
that
time
,
so
that
I
be
once
just
a
-
go
to
confess
it
,
and
beg
him
to
forgive
me
,
but
I
keep
it
in
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
have
do
all
he
could
to
obtain
my
pardon
of
the
captain
,
but
could
not
and
he
know
no
way
for
me
but
to
have
patience
,
and
submit
to
my
fate
;
and
if
they
come
to
speak
with
any
ship
of
their
nation
at
the
Cape
,
he
would
endeavour
to
have
them
stand
in
,
and
fetch
us
off
again
,
if
we
may
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
beg
I
may
have
my
clothe
on
shore
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
be
afraid
I
should
have
little
need
of
clothe
,
<EOS>
for
he
do
not
see
how
we
could
long
subsist
on
the
island
,
and
that
he
have
be
tell
that
the
inhabitant
be
cannibal
or
man
-
eater
(
though
he
have
no
reason
for
that
suggestion
)
,
and
we
should
not
be
able
to
live
among
them
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
not
so
afraid
of
that
as
I
be
of
starve
for
want
of
victual
;
and
as
for
the
inhabitant
be
cannibal
,
I
believe
we
should
be
more
likely
to
eat
them
than
they
us
,
if
we
could
but
get
at
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
mightily
concern
,
I
say
,
we
should
have
no
weapon
with
us
to
defend
ourselves
,
and
I
beg
nothing
now
,
but
that
he
would
give
me
a
gun
and
a
sword
,
with
a
little
powder
and
shot
.
  
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
say
they
would
signify
nothing
to
us
,
for
it
be
impossible
for
us
to
pretend
to
preserve
our
life
among
such
a
populous
and
desperate
nation
as
the
people
of
this
island
be
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
,
however
,
it
would
do
us
this
good
,
for
we
should
not
be
devour
or
destroy
immediately
;
so
I
beg
hard
for
the
gun
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
tell
me
he
do
not
know
whether
the
captain
would
give
him
leave
to
give
me
a
gun
,
and
if
not
,
he
durst
not
do
it
;
but
he
promise
to
use
his
interest
to
obtain
it
for
me
,
which
he
do
,
and
the
next
day
he
send
me
a
gun
,
with
some
ammunition
,
but
tell
me
the
captain
would
not
suffer
the
ammunition
to
be
give
us
till
we
be
set
all
on
shore
,
and
till
he
be
just
go
to
set
sail
.
<EOS>
He
also
send
me
the
few
clothe
I
have
in
the
ship
,
which
indeed
be
not
many
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
after
this
,
we
be
all
carry
on
shore
together
;
the
rest
of
my
fellow
-
criminal
hear
I
have
a
gun
,
and
some
powder
and
shot
,
solicit
for
liberty
to
carry
the
like
with
them
,
which
be
also
grant
them
;
and
thus
we
be
set
on
shore
to
shift
for
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
at
our
first
come
into
the
island
we
be
terrify
exceedingly
with
the
sight
of
the
barbarous
people
,
whose
figure
be
make
more
terrible
to
us
than
it
really
be
by
the
report
we
have
of
them
from
the
seaman
;
but
when
we
come
to
converse
with
them
awhile
,
we
find
they
be
not
cannibal
,
as
be
report
,
or
such
as
would
fall
immediately
upon
us
and
eat
us
up
;
but
they
come
and
sit
down
by
us
,
and
wonder
much
at
our
clothe
and
arm
,
and
make
sign
to
give
us
some
victual
,
such
as
they
have
,
which
be
only
root
and
plant
dig
out
of
the
ground
for
the
present
,
but
they
bring
us
fowl
and
flesh
afterwards
in
good
plenty
.
  
<EOS>
this
encourage
the
other
four
man
that
be
with
me
very
much
,
for
they
be
quite
deject
before
;
but
now
they
begin
to
be
very
familiar
with
them
,
and
make
sign
,
that
if
they
would
use
us
kindly
,
we
would
stay
and
live
with
them
;
which
they
seem
glad
of
,
though
they
know
little
of
the
necessity
we
be
under
to
do
so
,
or
how
much
we
be
afraid
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
upon
second
thought
we
resolve
that
we
would
only
stay
in
that
part
so
long
as
the
ship
rid
in
the
bay
,
and
then
make
them
believe
we
be
go
with
the
ship
,
we
would
go
and
place
ourselves
,
if
possible
,
where
there
be
no
inhabitant
to
be
see
,
and
so
live
as
we
could
,
or
perhaps
watch
for
a
ship
that
may
be
drive
upon
the
coast
as
we
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
ship
continue
a
fortnight
in
the
road
,
repair
some
damage
which
have
be
do
her
in
the
late
storm
,
and
take
in
wood
and
water
;
and
during
this
time
,
the
boat
come
often
on
shore
,
the
man
bring
us
several
refreshment
,
and
the
native
believe
we
only
belong
to
the
ship
,
be
civil
enough
.
<EOS>
We
live
in
a
kind
of
a
tent
on
the
shore
,
or
rather
a
hut
,
which
we
make
with
the
bough
of
tree
,
and
sometimes
in
the
night
retire
to
a
wood
a
little
out
of
their
way
,
to
let
them
think
we
be
go
on
board
the
ship
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
find
them
barbarous
,
treacherous
,
and
villainous
enough
in
their
nature
,
only
civil
from
fear
,
and
therefore
conclude
we
should
soon
fall
into
their
hand
when
the
ship
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
sense
of
this
work
upon
my
fellow
-
sufferer
even
to
distraction
;
and
one
of
them
,
be
a
carpenter
,
in
his
mad
fit
,
swam
off
to
the
ship
in
the
night
,
though
she
lie
then
a
league
to
sea
,
and
make
such
pitiful
moan
to
be
take
in
,
that
the
captain
be
prevail
with
at
last
to
take
him
in
,
though
they
let
him
lie
swim
three
hour
in
the
water
before
he
consent
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
and
his
humble
submission
,
the
captain
receive
him
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
the
importunity
of
this
man
(
who
for
some
time
petition
to
be
take
in
,
though
they
hang
him
as
soon
as
they
have
him
)
be
such
as
could
not
be
resist
;
for
,
after
he
have
swam
so
long
about
the
ship
,
he
be
not
able
to
reach
the
shore
again
;
and
the
captain
see
evidently
that
the
man
must
be
take
on
board
or
suffer
to
drown
,
and
the
whole
ship
's
company
offer
to
be
bind
for
him
for
his
good
behaviour
,
the
captain
at
last
yield
,
and
he
be
take
up
,
but
almost
dead
with
his
be
so
long
in
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
man
be
get
in
,
he
never
leave
importune
the
captain
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
officer
,
in
behalf
of
us
that
be
behind
,
but
to
the
very
last
day
the
captain
be
inexorable
;
when
,
at
the
time
their
preparation
be
make
to
sail
,
and
order
give
to
hoist
the
boat
into
the
ship
,
all
the
seaman
in
a
body
come
up
to
the
rail
of
the
quarter
-
deck
,
where
the
captain
be
walk
with
some
of
his
officer
,
and
appoint
the
boatswain
to
speak
for
them
,
he
go
up
,
and
fall
on
his
knee
to
the
captain
,
beg
of
him
,
in
the
humblest
manner
possible
,
to
receive
the
four
man
on
board
again
,
offer
to
answer
for
their
fidelity
,
or
to
have
them
keep
in
chain
till
they
come
to
Lisbon
,
and
there
to
be
deliver
up
to
justice
,
rather
than
,
as
they
say
,
to
have
them
leave
to
be
murder
by
savage
,
or
devour
by
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
while
ere
<EOS>
the
captain
take
any
notice
of
them
,
but
when
he
do
,
he
order
the
boatswain
to
be
seize
,
and
threaten
to
bring
him
to
the
capstan
for
speak
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
severity
,
one
of
the
seaman
,
bold
than
the
rest
,
but
still
with
all
possible
respect
to
the
captain
,
besought
his
honour
,
as
he
call
him
,
that
he
would
give
leave
to
some
more
of
them
to
go
on
shore
,
and
die
with
their
companion
,
or
,
if
possible
,
to
assist
them
to
resist
the
barbarian
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
rather
provoke
than
cow
with
this
,
come
to
the
barricade
of
the
quarter
-
deck
,
and
speak
very
prudently
to
the
man
(
for
have
he
speak
roughly
,
two
-
third
of
them
would
have
leave
the
ship
,
if
not
all
of
them
)
,
he
tell
them
,
it
be
for
their
safety
as
well
as
his
own
that
he
have
be
oblige
to
that
severity
;
<EOS>
that
mutiny
on
board
a
ship
be
the
same
thing
as
treason
in
a
king
's
palace
,
and
he
could
not
answer
it
to
his
owner
and
employer
to
trust
the
ship
and
good
commit
to
his
charge
with
man
who
have
entertain
thought
of
the
bad
and
black
nature
;
that
he
wish
heartily
that
it
have
be
anywhere
else
that
they
have
be
set
on
shore
,
where
they
may
have
be
in
less
hazard
from
the
savage
;
that
,
if
he
have
design
they
should
be
destroy
,
he
could
as
well
have
execute
them
on
board
as
the
other
two
;
that
he
wish
it
have
be
in
some
other
part
of
the
world
,
where
he
may
have
deliver
them
up
to
the
civil
justice
,
or
may
have
leave
them
among
Christians
;
but
it
be
well
their
life
be
put
in
hazard
than
his
life
,
and
the
safety
of
the
ship
;
and
that
though
he
do
not
know
that
he
have
deserve
so
ill
of
any
of
them
as
that
they
should
leave
the
ship
rather
than
do
their
duty
,
yet
if
any
of
them
be
resolve
to
do
so
unless
he
would
consent
to
take
a
gang
of
traitor
on
board
,
who
,
as
he
have
prove
before
them
all
,
have
conspire
to
murder
him
,
he
would
not
hinder
them
,
nor
for
the
present
would
he
resent
their
importunity
;
but
,
if
there
be
nobody
leave
in
the
ship
but
himself
,
he
would
never
consent
to
take
them
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
this
discourse
be
deliver
so
well
,
be
in
itself
so
reasonable
,
be
manage
with
so
much
temper
,
yet
so
boldly
conclude
with
a
negative
,
that
the
great
part
of
the
man
be
satisfied
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
it
put
the
man
into
juntos
and
cabal
,
they
be
not
compose
for
some
hour
;
the
wind
also
slacken
towards
night
,
the
captain
order
not
to
weigh
till
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
night
twenty
-
three
of
the
man
,
among
whom
be
the
gunner
's
mate
,
the
surgeon
's
assistant
,
and
two
carpenter
,
apply
to
the
chief
mate
tell
him
,
that
as
the
captain
have
give
them
leave
to
go
on
shore
to
their
comrade
,
they
beg
that
he
would
speak
to
the
captain
not
to
take
it
ill
that
they
be
desirous
to
go
and
die
with
their
companion
;
and
that
they
think
they
could
do
no
less
in
such
an
extremity
than
go
to
them
;
because
,
if
there
be
any
way
to
save
their
life
,
it
be
by
add
to
their
number
,
and
make
them
strong
enough
to
assist
one
another
in
defend
themselves
against
the
savage
,
till
perhaps
they
may
one
time
or
other
find
mean
to
make
their
escape
,
and
get
to
their
own
country
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
mate
tell
them
,
in
so
many
word
,
that
he
durst
not
speak
to
the
captain
upon
any
such
design
,
and
be
very
sorry
they
have
no
more
respect
for
him
than
to
desire
him
to
go
upon
such
an
errand
;
but
,
if
they
be
resolve
upon
such
an
enterprise
,
he
would
advise
them
to
take
the
long
-
boat
in
the
morning
betime
,
and
go
off
,
see
the
captain
have
give
them
leave
,
and
leave
a
civil
letter
behind
them
to
the
captain
,
and
to
desire
him
to
send
his
man
on
shore
for
the
boat
,
which
should
be
deliver
very
honestly
,
and
he
promise
to
keep
their
counsel
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
an
hour
before
day
,
those
twenty
-
three
man
,
with
every
man
a
firelock
and
a
cutlass
,
with
some
pistol
,
three
halberd
or
half
-
pike
,
and
good
store
of
powder
and
ball
,
without
any
provision
but
about
half
a
hundred
of
bread
,
but
with
all
their
chest
and
clothe
,
tool
,
instrument
,
book
,
&
c.
,
embark
themselves
so
silently
,
that
the
captain
get
no
notice
of
it
till
they
be
get
half
the
way
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
captain
hear
of
it
he
call
for
the
gunner
's
mate
,
the
chief
gunner
be
at
the
time
sick
in
his
cabin
,
and
order
to
fire
at
them
;
but
,
to
his
great
mortification
,
the
gunner
's
mate
be
one
of
the
number
,
and
be
go
with
them
;
and
indeed
it
be
by
this
mean
they
get
so
many
arm
and
so
much
ammunition
.
<EOS>
when
the
captain
find
how
it
be
,
and
that
there
be
no
help
for
it
,
he
begin
to
be
a
little
appeased
,
and
make
light
of
it
,
and
call
up
the
man
,
and
speak
kindly
to
them
,
and
tell
them
he
be
very
well
satisfied
in
the
fidelity
and
ability
of
those
that
be
now
leave
,
and
that
he
would
give
to
them
,
for
their
encouragement
,
to
be
divide
among
them
,
the
wage
which
be
due
to
the
man
that
be
go
,
and
that
it
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
him
that
the
ship
be
free
from
such
a
mutinous
rabble
,
who
have
not
the
least
reason
for
their
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
seem
very
well
satisfied
,
and
particularly
the
promise
of
the
wage
of
those
who
be
go
go
a
great
way
with
them
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
the
letter
which
be
leave
by
the
man
be
give
to
the
captain
by
his
boy
,
with
whom
,
it
seem
,
the
man
have
leave
it
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
much
to
the
same
purpose
of
what
they
have
say
to
the
mate
,
and
which
he
decline
to
say
for
them
,
only
that
at
the
end
of
their
letter
they
tell
the
captain
that
,
as
they
have
no
dishonest
design
,
so
they
have
take
nothing
away
with
them
which
be
not
their
own
,
except
some
arm
and
ammunition
,
such
as
be
absolutely
necessary
to
them
,
as
well
for
their
defence
against
the
savage
as
to
kill
fowl
or
beast
for
their
food
,
that
they
may
not
perish
;
and
as
there
be
considerable
sum
due
to
them
for
wage
,
they
hope
he
would
allow
the
arm
and
ammunition
upon
their
account
.
<EOS>
They
tell
him
that
,
as
to
the
ship
's
longboat
,
which
they
have
take
to
bring
them
on
shore
,
they
know
it
be
necessary
to
him
,
and
they
be
very
willing
to
restore
it
to
him
,
and
if
he
please
to
send
for
it
,
it
should
be
very
honestly
deliver
to
his
man
,
and
not
the
least
injury
offer
to
any
of
those
who
come
for
it
,
nor
the
least
persuasion
or
invitation
make
use
of
to
any
of
them
to
stay
with
them
;
and
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
letter
,
they
very
humbly
beseech
him
that
,
for
their
defence
,
and
for
the
safety
of
their
life
,
he
would
be
pleased
to
send
them
a
barrel
of
powder
and
some
ammunition
,
and
give
them
leave
to
keep
the
mast
and
sail
of
the
boat
,
that
if
it
be
possible
for
them
to
make
themselves
a
boat
of
any
kind
,
they
may
shift
off
to
sea
,
to
save
themselves
in
such
part
of
the
world
as
their
fate
should
direct
them
to
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
the
captain
,
who
have
win
much
upon
the
rest
of
his
man
by
what
he
have
say
to
them
,
and
be
very
easy
as
to
the
general
peace
(
for
it
be
very
true
that
the
most
mutinous
of
the
man
be
go
)
,
come
out
to
the
quarter
-
deck
,
and
,
call
the
man
together
,
let
them
know
the
substance
of
the
letter
,
and
tell
the
man
that
,
however
they
have
not
deserve
such
civility
from
him
,
yet
he
be
not
willing
to
expose
them
more
than
they
be
willing
to
expose
themselves
;
he
be
inclined
to
send
them
some
ammunition
,
and
as
they
have
desire
but
one
barrel
of
powder
,
he
would
send
them
two
barrel
,
and
shoot
,
or
lead
and
mould
to
make
shot
,
in
proportion
;
and
,
to
let
them
see
that
he
be
civiller
to
them
than
they
deserve
,
he
order
a
cask
of
arrack
and
a
great
bag
of
bread
to
be
send
them
for
subsistence
till
they
should
be
able
to
furnish
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
man
applaud
the
captain
's
generosity
,
and
every
one
of
them
send
us
something
or
other
,
and
about
three
in
the
afternoon
the
pinnace
come
on
shore
,
and
bring
us
all
these
thing
,
which
we
be
very
glad
of
,
and
return
the
long
-
boat
accordingly
;
and
as
to
the
man
that
come
with
the
pinnace
,
as
the
captain
have
single
out
such
man
as
he
know
would
not
come
over
to
us
,
so
they
have
positive
order
not
to
bring
any
one
of
us
on
board
again
,
upon
pain
of
death
;
and
indeed
both
be
so
true
to
our
point
,
that
we
neither
ask
them
to
stay
,
nor
they
us
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
a
good
troop
,
be
in
all
twenty
-
seven
man
,
very
well
armed
,
and
provide
with
everything
but
victual
;
we
have
two
carpenter
among
us
,
a
gunner
,
and
,
which
be
worth
all
the
rest
,
a
surgeon
or
doctor
;
that
be
to
say
,
he
be
an
assistant
to
a
surgeon
at
Goa
,
and
be
entertain
as
a
supernumerary
with
us
.
<EOS>
the
carpenter
have
bring
all
their
tool
,
the
doctor
all
his
instrument
and
medicine
,
and
indeed
we
have
a
great
deal
of
baggage
,
that
be
to
say
,
on
the
whole
,
for
some
of
us
have
little
more
than
the
clothe
on
our
back
,
of
whom
I
be
one
;
but
I
have
one
thing
which
none
of
them
have
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
I
have
the
twenty
-
two
moidore
of
gold
which
I
have
steal
at
the
Brazils
,
and
two
piece
of
eight
.
<EOS>
the
two
piece
of
eight
I
show
,
and
one
moidore
,
and
none
of
them
ever
suspect
that
I
have
any
more
money
in
the
world
,
have
be
know
to
be
only
a
poor
boy
take
up
in
charity
,
as
you
have
hear
,
and
use
like
a
slave
,
and
in
the
bad
manner
of
a
slave
,
by
my
cruel
master
the
pilot
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
easy
to
imagine
we
four
that
be
leave
at
first
<EOS>
be
joyful
,
nay
,
even
surprised
with
joy
at
the
coming
of
the
rest
,
though
at
first
we
be
fright
,
and
think
they
come
to
fetch
us
back
to
hang
us
;
but
they
take
way
quickly
to
satisfy
us
that
they
be
in
the
same
condition
with
us
,
only
with
this
additional
circumstance
,
theirs
be
voluntary
,
and
our
by
force
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
piece
of
news
they
tell
us
after
the
short
history
of
their
come
away
be
,
that
our
companion
be
on
board
,
but
how
he
get
thither
<EOS>
we
could
not
imagine
,
for
he
have
give
us
the
slip
,
and
we
never
imagine
he
could
swim
so
well
as
to
venture
off
to
the
ship
,
which
lie
at
so
great
a
distance
;
<EOS>
nay
,
we
do
not
so
much
as
know
that
he
could
swim
at
all
,
and
not
think
anything
of
what
really
happen
<EOS>
,
we
think
he
must
have
wander
into
the
wood
and
be
devour
,
or
be
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
native
,
and
be
murder
;
and
these
thought
fill
us
with
fear
enough
,
and
of
several
kind
,
about
its
be
some
time
or
other
our
lot
to
fall
into
their
hand
also
.
<EOS>
but
hear
how
he
have
with
much
difficulty
be
receive
on
board
the
ship
again
and
pardon
,
we
be
much
better
satisfied
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
be
now
,
as
I
have
say
,
a
considerable
number
of
us
,
and
in
condition
to
defend
ourselves
,
the
first
thing
we
do
be
to
give
every
one
his
hand
that
we
would
not
separate
from
one
another
upon
any
occasion
whatsoever
,
but
that
we
would
live
and
die
together
;
that
we
would
kill
no
food
,
but
that
we
would
distribute
it
in
public
;
and
that
we
would
be
in
all
thing
guide
by
the
majority
,
and
not
insist
upon
our
own
resolution
in
anything
if
the
majority
be
against
it
;
that
we
would
appoint
a
captain
among
us
to
be
our
governor
or
leader
during
pleasure
;
that
while
he
be
in
office
we
would
obey
him
without
reserve
,
on
pain
of
death
;
and
that
every
one
should
take
turn
,
but
the
captain
be
not
to
act
in
any
particular
thing
without
advice
of
the
rest
,
and
by
the
majority
.
  
<EOS>
have
establish
these
rule
,
we
resolve
to
enter
into
some
measure
for
our
food
,
and
for
converse
with
the
inhabitant
or
native
of
the
island
for
our
supply
.
<EOS>
as
for
food
,
they
be
at
first
very
useful
to
us
,
but
we
soon
grow
weary
of
them
,
be
an
ignorant
,
ravenous
,
brutish
sort
of
people
,
even
bad
than
the
native
of
any
other
country
that
we
have
see
;
and
we
soon
find
that
the
principal
part
of
our
subsistence
be
to
be
have
by
our
gun
,
shooting
of
deer
and
other
creature
,
and
fowl
of
all
other
sort
,
of
which
there
be
abundance
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
the
native
do
not
disturb
or
concern
themselves
much
about
us
;
nor
do
they
inquire
,
or
perhaps
know
,
whether
we
stay
among
them
or
not
,
much
less
that
our
ship
be
go
quite
away
,
and
have
cast
us
off
,
as
be
our
case
;
for
the
next
morning
,
after
we
have
send
back
the
long
-
boat
,
the
ship
stand
away
to
the
south
-
east
,
and
in
four
hour
'
time
be
out
of
our
sight
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
two
of
us
go
out
into
the
country
one
way
,
and
two
another
,
to
see
what
kind
of
a
land
we
be
in
;
and
we
soon
find
the
country
be
very
pleasant
and
fruitful
,
and
a
convenient
place
enough
to
live
in
;
but
,
as
before
,
inhabit
by
a
parcel
of
creature
scarce
human
,
or
capable
of
be
make
social
on
any
account
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
the
place
full
of
cattle
and
provision
;
but
whether
we
may
venture
to
take
them
where
we
could
find
them
or
not
,
we
do
not
know
;
and
though
we
be
under
a
necessity
to
get
provision
,
yet
we
be
loth
to
bring
down
a
whole
nation
of
devil
upon
us
at
once
,
and
therefore
some
of
our
company
agree
to
try
to
speak
with
some
of
the
country
,
if
we
could
,
that
we
may
see
what
course
be
to
be
take
with
them
.
<EOS>
eleven
of
our
man
go
on
this
errand
,
well
armed
and
furnish
for
defence
.
<EOS>
They
bring
word
that
they
have
see
some
of
the
native
,
who
appear
very
civil
to
them
,
but
very
shy
and
afraid
,
see
their
gun
,
for
it
be
easy
to
perceive
that
the
native
know
what
their
gun
be
,
and
what
use
they
be
of
.
  
<EOS>
They
make
sign
to
the
native
for
some
food
,
and
they
go
and
fetch
several
herb
and
root
,
and
some
milk
;
but
it
be
evident
they
do
not
design
to
give
it
away
,
but
to
sell
it
,
make
sign
to
know
what
our
man
would
give
them
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
be
perplex
at
this
,
for
they
have
nothing
to
barter
;
however
,
one
of
the
man
pull
out
a
knife
and
show
them
,
and
they
be
so
fond
of
it
that
they
be
ready
to
go
together
by
the
ear
for
the
knife
.
<EOS>
the
seaman
see
that
,
be
willing
to
make
a
good
market
of
his
knife
,
and
keep
them
chaffer
about
it
a
good
while
,
some
offer
him
root
,
and
other
milk
;
at
last
one
offer
him
a
goat
for
it
,
which
he
take
.
<EOS>
then
another
of
our
man
show
them
another
knife
,
but
they
have
nothing
good
enough
for
that
<EOS>
,
whereupon
one
of
them
make
sign
that
he
would
go
and
fetch
something
;
so
our
man
stay
three
hour
for
their
return
,
when
they
come
back
and
bring
him
a
small
-
sized
,
thick
,
short
cow
,
very
fat
and
good
meat
,
and
give
him
for
his
knife
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
good
market
,
but
our
misfortune
be
we
have
no
merchandise
;
for
our
knife
be
as
needful
to
us
as
to
them
,
and
but
that
we
be
in
distress
for
food
,
and
must
of
necessity
have
some
,
these
man
would
not
have
part
with
their
knife
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
in
a
little
time
more
we
find
that
the
wood
be
full
of
living
creature
,
which
we
may
kill
for
our
food
,
and
that
without
give
offence
to
them
;
so
that
our
man
go
daily
out
a
-
hunting
,
and
never
fail
in
kill
something
or
other
;
for
,
as
to
the
native
,
we
have
no
good
to
barter
;
and
for
money
,
all
the
stock
among
us
would
not
have
subsist
us
long
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
call
a
general
council
to
see
what
money
we
have
,
and
to
bring
it
all
together
,
that
it
may
go
as
far
as
possible
;
and
when
it
come
to
my
turn
,
I
pull
out
a
moidore
and
the
two
dollar
I
speak
of
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
moidore
I
venture
to
show
,
that
they
may
not
despise
me
too
much
for
add
too
little
to
the
store
,
and
that
they
may
not
pretend
to
search
me
;
and
they
be
very
civil
to
me
,
upon
the
presumption
that
I
have
be
so
faithful
to
them
as
not
to
conceal
anything
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
money
do
us
little
service
,
for
the
people
<EOS>
neither
know
the
value
or
the
use
of
it
,
nor
could
they
justly
rate
the
gold
in
proportion
with
the
silver
;
so
that
all
our
money
,
which
be
not
much
when
it
be
all
put
together
,
would
go
but
a
little
way
with
us
,
that
be
to
say
,
to
buy
us
provision
.
  
<EOS>
Our
next
consideration
be
to
get
away
from
this
cursed
place
,
and
whither
to
go
.
<EOS>
when
my
opinion
come
to
be
ask
,
I
tell
them
I
would
leave
that
all
to
them
,
and
<EOS>
I
tell
them
I
have
rather
<EOS>
they
would
let
me
go
into
the
wood
to
get
them
some
provision
,
than
consult
with
me
,
for
I
would
agree
to
whatever
they
do
;
but
they
would
not
agree
to
that
,
for
they
would
not
consent
that
any
of
us
should
go
into
the
wood
alone
;
for
though
we
have
yet
see
no
lion
or
tiger
in
the
wood
,
we
be
assure
there
be
many
in
the
island
,
besides
other
creature
as
dangerous
,
and
perhaps
bad
,
as
we
afterwards
find
by
our
own
experience
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
many
adventure
in
the
wood
,
for
our
provision
,
and
often
meet
with
wild
and
terrible
beast
,
which
we
could
not
call
by
their
name
;
but
as
they
be
,
like
us
,
seek
their
prey
,
but
be
themselves
good
for
nothing
,
so
we
disturb
them
as
little
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Our
consultation
concern
our
escape
from
this
place
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
we
be
now
upon
,
end
in
this
only
,
that
as
we
have
two
carpenter
among
us
,
and
that
they
have
tool
almost
of
all
sort
with
them
,
we
should
try
to
build
us
a
boat
to
go
off
to
sea
with
,
and
that
then
,
perhaps
,
we
may
find
our
way
back
to
Goa
,
or
land
on
some
more
proper
place
to
make
our
escape
.
<EOS>
the
counsel
of
this
assembly
be
not
of
great
moment
,
yet
as
they
seem
to
be
introductory
of
many
more
remarkable
adventure
which
happen
under
my
conduct
<EOS>
hereabouts
<EOS>
many
year
after
,
I
think
this
miniature
of
my
future
enterprise
may
not
be
unpleasant
to
relate
.
  
<EOS>
to
the
building
of
a
boat
I
make
no
objection
,
and
away
they
go
to
work
immediately
;
but
as
they
go
on
,
great
difficulty
occur
,
such
as
the
want
of
saw
to
cut
our
plank
;
nail
,
bolt
,
and
spike
,
to
fasten
the
timber
;
hemp
,
pitch
,
and
tar
,
to
caulk
and
pay
her
seam
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
one
of
the
company
propose
that
,
instead
of
build
a
bark
or
sloop
,
or
shallop
,
or
whatever
they
would
call
it
,
which
they
find
be
so
difficult
,
they
would
rather
make
a
large
periagua
,
or
canoe
,
which
may
be
do
with
great
ease
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
presently
object
,
that
we
could
never
make
a
canoe
large
enough
to
pass
the
great
ocean
,
which
we
be
to
go
over
to
get
to
the
coast
of
Malabar
;
that
it
not
only
would
not
bear
the
sea
,
but
it
would
never
bear
the
burden
,
for
we
be
not
only
twenty
-
seven
man
of
us
,
but
have
a
great
deal
of
luggage
with
us
,
and
must
,
for
our
provision
,
take
in
a
great
deal
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
propose
to
speak
in
their
general
consultation
before
,
but
find
they
be
at
some
loss
about
what
kind
of
vessel
they
should
make
,
and
how
to
make
it
,
and
what
would
be
fit
for
our
use
,
and
what
not
<EOS>
,
I
tell
them
I
find
they
be
at
a
full
stop
in
their
counsel
of
every
kind
<EOS>
;
that
it
be
true
we
could
never
pretend
to
go
over
to
Goa
on
the
coast
of
Malabar
in
a
canoe
,
which
though
we
could
all
get
into
it
,
and
that
it
would
bear
the
sea
well
enough
,
yet
would
not
hold
our
provision
,
and
especially
we
could
not
put
fresh
water
enough
into
it
for
the
voyage
;
and
to
make
such
an
adventure
would
be
nothing
but
mere
run
into
certain
destruction
,
and
yet
that
nevertheless
I
be
for
make
a
canoe
.
  
<EOS>
They
answer
,
that
they
understand
all
I
have
say
before
well
enough
,
but
what
I
mean
by
tell
them
first
how
dangerous
and
impossible
it
be
to
make
our
escape
in
a
canoe
,
and
yet
then
to
advise
make
a
canoe
,
that
they
could
not
understand
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
I
answer
,
that
I
conceive
our
business
be
not
to
attempt
our
escape
in
a
canoe
,
but
that
,
as
there
be
other
vessel
at
sea
besides
our
ship
,
and
that
there
be
few
nation
that
live
on
the
sea
-
shore
that
be
so
barbarous
,
but
that
they
go
to
sea
in
some
boat
or
other
,
our
business
be
to
cruise
along
the
coast
of
the
island
,
which
be
very
long
,
and
to
seize
upon
the
first
we
could
get
that
be
well
than
our
own
,
and
so
from
that
to
another
,
till
perhaps
we
may
at
last
get
a
good
ship
to
carry
us
wherever
we
please
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
excellent
advice
,
"
say
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
admirable
advice
,
"
say
another
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
the
third
(
which
be
the
gunner
)
,
"
the
english
dog
have
give
excellent
advice
;
but
it
be
just
the
way
to
bring
us
all
to
the
gallow
.
<EOS>
the
rogue
have
give
us
devilish
advice
,
indeed
,
to
go
a
-
thieving
,
till
from
a
little
vessel
<EOS>
we
come
to
a
great
ship
,
and
so
we
shall
turn
downright
pirate
,
the
end
of
which
be
to
be
hang
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
call
us
pirate
,
"
say
another
,
"
if
you
will
,
and
if
we
fall
into
bad
hand
,
we
may
be
use
like
pirate
;
but
I
care
not
for
that
,
I
will
be
a
pirate
,
or
anything
,
<EOS>
nay
,
I
will
be
hang
for
a
pirate
rather
than
starve
here
,
therefore
I
think
the
advice
be
very
good
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
they
cry
all
,
"
let
us
have
a
canoe
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gunner
,
over
-
rule
by
the
rest
,
submit
;
but
as
we
break
up
the
council
,
he
come
to
me
,
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
,
look
into
the
palm
of
my
hand
,
and
into
my
face
too
,
very
gravely
,
"
My
lad
,
"
say
he
,
"
thou
art
bear
to
do
a
world
of
mischief
;
thou
hast
commence
pirate
very
young
;
but
have
a
care
of
the
gallow
,
young
man
;
have
a
care
,
I
say
,
for
thou
wilt
be
an
eminent
thief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
laugh
at
him
,
and
tell
him
I
do
not
know
what
I
may
come
to
hereafter
,
but
as
our
case
be
now
,
I
should
make
no
scruple
to
take
the
first
ship
I
come
at
to
get
our
liberty
;
I
only
wish
we
could
see
one
,
and
come
at
her
.
<EOS>
just
while
we
be
talk
,
one
of
our
man
that
be
at
the
door
of
our
hut
,
tell
us
that
the
carpenter
,
who
it
seem
be
upon
a
hill
at
a
distance
,
cry
out
,
"
a
sail
!
<EOS>
a
sail
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
all
turn
out
immediately
;
but
,
though
it
be
very
clear
weather
,
we
could
see
nothing
;
but
the
carpenter
continue
to
halloo
to
us
,
"
a
sail
!
<EOS>
a
sail
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
away
we
run
up
the
hill
,
and
there
we
see
a
ship
plainly
;
but
it
be
at
a
very
great
distance
,
too
far
for
us
to
make
any
signal
to
her
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
make
a
fire
upon
the
hill
,
with
all
the
wood
we
could
get
together
,
and
make
as
much
smoke
as
possible
.
<EOS>
the
wind
be
down
,
and
it
be
almost
calm
;
but
as
we
think
,
by
a
perspective
glass
which
the
gunner
have
in
his
pocket
,
her
sail
be
full
,
and
she
stand
away
large
with
the
wind
at
E.N.E.
,
take
no
notice
of
our
signal
,
but
make
for
the
Cape
de
Bona
Speranza
;
so
we
have
no
comfort
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
,
therefore
,
immediately
to
work
about
our
intend
canoe
;
and
,
have
single
out
a
very
large
tree
to
our
mind
,
we
fall
to
work
with
her
;
and
have
three
good
axis
among
us
,
we
get
it
down
,
but
it
be
four
day
'
time
first
,
though
we
work
very
hard
too
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
what
wood
it
be
,
or
exactly
what
dimension
,
but
I
remember
that
it
be
a
very
large
one
,
and
we
be
as
much
encouraged
when
we
launch
it
,
and
find
it
swam
upright
and
steady
,
as
we
would
have
be
at
another
time
if
we
have
have
a
good
man
-
of
-
war
at
our
command
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
so
very
large
,
that
she
carry
us
all
very
,
very
easily
,
and
would
have
carry
two
or
three
ton
of
baggage
with
us
;
so
that
we
begin
to
consult
about
go
to
sea
directly
to
Goa
;
but
many
other
consideration
check
that
thought
,
especially
when
we
come
to
look
near
into
it
;
such
as
want
of
provision
,
and
no
cask
for
fresh
water
;
no
compass
to
steer
by
;
no
shelter
from
the
breach
of
the
high
sea
,
which
would
certainly
founder
us
;
no
defence
from
the
heat
of
the
weather
,
and
the
like
;
so
that
they
all
come
readily
into
my
project
,
to
cruise
about
where
we
be
,
and
see
what
may
offer
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
to
gratify
our
fancy
,
we
go
one
day
all
out
to
sea
in
her
together
,
and
we
be
in
a
very
fair
way
to
have
have
enough
of
it
;
for
when
she
have
us
all
on
board
,
and
that
we
be
get
about
half
a
league
to
sea
,
there
happen
to
be
a
pretty
high
swell
of
the
sea
,
<EOS>
though
little
or
no
wind
,
yet
she
wallow
so
in
the
sea
,
that
we
all
of
us
think
she
would
at
last
wallow
herself
bottom
up
;
so
we
set
all
to
work
to
get
her
in
nearer
the
shore
,
and
give
her
fresh
way
in
the
sea
,
she
swam
more
steady
,
and
with
some
hard
work
we
get
her
under
the
land
again
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
at
a
great
loss
;
the
native
be
civil
enough
to
us
,
and
come
often
to
discourse
with
us
;
one
time
they
bring
one
whom
they
show
respect
to
as
a
king
with
them
,
and
they
set
up
a
long
pole
between
them
and
us
,
with
a
great
tassel
of
hair
hang
,
not
on
the
top
,
but
something
above
the
middle
of
it
,
adorn
with
little
chain
,
shell
,
bit
of
brass
,
and
the
like
;
and
this
,
we
understand
afterwards
,
be
a
token
of
amity
and
friendship
;
and
they
bring
down
to
us
victual
in
abundance
,
cattle
,
fowl
,
herb
,
and
root
;
but
we
be
in
the
utmost
confusion
on
our
side
;
for
we
have
nothing
to
buy
with
,
or
exchange
for
;
and
as
to
give
us
thing
for
nothing
they
have
no
notion
of
that
again
.
<EOS>
as
to
our
money
,
it
be
mere
trash
to
them
,
they
have
no
value
for
it
;
so
that
we
be
in
a
fair
way
to
be
starve
.
<EOS>
have
we
have
but
some
toy
and
trinket
,
brass
chain
,
bauble
,
glass
bead
,
or
,
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
veri
trifle
that
a
shipload
of
would
not
have
be
worth
the
freight
<EOS>
,
we
may
have
buy
cattle
and
provision
enough
for
an
army
,
or
to
victual
a
fleet
of
man
-
of
-
war
;
but
for
gold
or
silver
we
could
get
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
we
be
in
a
strange
consternation
.
<EOS>
I
be
but
a
young
fellow
,
but
I
be
for
fall
upon
them
with
our
firearm
,
and
take
all
the
cattle
from
them
,
and
send
them
to
the
devil
to
stop
their
hunger
,
rather
than
be
starve
ourselves
;
but
I
do
not
consider
that
this
may
have
bring
ten
thousand
of
them
down
upon
us
the
next
day
;
and
though
we
may
have
kill
a
vast
number
of
them
,
and
perhaps
have
fright
the
rest
,
yet
their
own
desperation
,
and
our
small
number
,
would
have
animate
them
so
that
,
one
time
or
other
,
they
would
have
destroy
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
our
consultation
,
one
of
our
man
who
have
be
a
kind
of
a
cutler
,
or
worker
in
iron
,
start
up
and
ask
the
carpenter
if
,
among
all
his
tool
,
he
could
not
help
him
to
a
file
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
carpenter
,
"
I
can
,
but
it
be
a
small
one
.
"
<EOS>
"
the
small
the
well
,
"
say
the
other
.
<EOS>
upon
this
he
go
to
work
,
and
first
by
heat
a
piece
of
an
old
break
chisel
in
the
fire
,
and
then
with
the
help
of
his
file
,
he
make
himself
several
kind
of
tool
for
his
work
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
three
or
four
piece
of
eight
,
and
beat
them
out
with
a
hammer
upon
a
stone
,
till
they
be
very
broad
and
thin
;
then
he
cut
them
out
into
the
shape
of
bird
and
beast
;
he
make
little
chain
of
them
for
bracelet
and
necklace
,
and
turn
them
into
so
many
device
of
his
own
head
,
that
it
be
hardly
to
be
express
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
for
about
a
fortnight
exercise
his
head
and
hand
at
this
work
,
we
try
the
effect
of
his
ingenuity
;
and
,
have
another
meeting
with
the
native
,
be
surprised
to
see
the
folly
of
the
poor
people
.
<EOS>
for
a
little
bit
of
silver
cut
in
the
shape
of
a
bird
,
we
have
two
cow
,
and
,
which
be
our
loss
,
if
it
have
be
in
brass
,
it
have
be
still
of
more
value
.
<EOS>
for
one
of
the
bracelet
make
of
chain
-
work
,
we
have
as
much
provision
of
several
sort
,
as
would
fairly
have
be
worth
,
in
England
,
fifteen
or
sixteen
pound
;
and
so
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
thus
,
that
which
when
it
be
in
coin
be
not
worth
sixpence
to
us
,
when
thus
convert
into
toy
and
trifle
,
be
worth
a
hundred
time
its
real
value
,
and
purchase
for
us
anything
we
have
occasion
for
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
we
live
upwards
of
a
year
,
but
all
of
us
begin
to
be
very
much
tired
of
it
,
and
,
whatever
come
of
it
,
resolve
to
attempt
an
escape
.
<EOS>
We
have
furnish
ourselves
with
no
less
than
three
very
good
canoe
;
and
as
the
monsoon
,
or
trade
-
wind
,
generally
affect
that
country
,
blow
in
most
part
of
this
island
one
six
month
of
a
year
one
way
,
and
the
other
six
month
another
way
,
we
conclude
we
may
be
able
to
bear
the
sea
well
enough
.
<EOS>
but
always
,
when
we
come
to
look
into
it
,
the
want
of
fresh
water
be
the
thing
that
put
us
off
from
such
an
adventure
,
for
it
be
a
prodigious
length
,
and
what
no
man
on
earth
could
be
able
to
perform
without
water
to
drink
.
  
<EOS>
be
thus
prevail
upon
by
our
own
reason
to
set
the
thought
of
that
voyage
aside
,
we
have
then
but
two
thing
before
us
;
one
be
,
to
put
to
sea
the
other
way
;
viz
.
,
west
,
and
go
away
for
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
where
,
first
or
last
,
we
should
meet
with
some
of
our
own
country
ship
,
or
else
to
put
for
the
mainland
of
Africa
,
and
either
travel
by
land
,
or
sail
along
the
coast
towards
the
Red
Sea
,
where
we
should
,
first
or
last
,
find
a
ship
of
some
nation
or
other
,
that
would
take
us
up
;
or
perhaps
we
may
take
them
up
,
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
be
the
thing
that
always
run
in
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
our
ingenious
cutler
,
whom
ever
after
we
call
silversmith
,
that
propose
this
;
but
the
gunner
tell
him
,
that
he
have
be
in
the
Red
Sea
in
a
Malabar
sloop
,
and
he
know
this
,
that
if
we
go
into
the
Red
Sea
,
we
should
either
be
kill
by
the
wild
Arabs
,
or
take
and
make
slave
of
by
the
Turks
;
and
therefore
he
be
not
for
go
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
I
take
occasion
to
put
in
my
vote
again
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
we
talk
of
be
kill
by
the
Arabs
,
or
make
slave
of
by
the
Turks
?
<EOS>
be
we
not
able
to
board
almost
any
vessel
we
shall
meet
with
in
those
sea
;
and
,
instead
of
their
take
us
,
we
to
take
them
?
"
<EOS>
"
well
do
,
pirate
,
"
say
the
gunner
(
he
that
have
look
in
my
hand
,
and
tell
me
I
should
come
to
the
gallow
)
,
"
I
will
say
that
for
him
,
"
say
he
,
"
he
always
look
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
,
of
my
conscience
,
it
be
our
only
way
now
.
"
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
me
,
"
say
I
,
"
of
be
a
pirate
;
we
must
be
pirate
,
or
anything
,
to
get
fairly
out
of
this
cursed
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
conclude
all
,
by
my
advice
,
that
our
business
be
to
cruise
for
anything
we
could
see
.
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
"
say
I
to
them
,
"
our
first
business
be
to
see
if
the
people
upon
this
island
have
no
navigation
,
and
what
boat
they
use
;
and
,
if
they
have
any
well
or
big
than
ours
,
let
us
take
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
first
,
indeed
,
all
our
aim
be
to
get
,
if
possible
,
a
boat
with
a
deck
and
a
sail
;
for
then
we
may
have
save
our
provision
,
which
otherwise
we
could
not
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
,
to
our
great
good
fortune
,
one
sailor
among
us
,
who
have
be
assistant
to
the
cook
;
he
tell
us
,
that
he
would
find
a
way
how
to
preserve
our
beef
without
cask
or
pickle
;
and
this
he
do
effectually
by
cure
it
in
the
sun
,
with
the
help
of
saltpetre
,
of
which
there
be
great
plenty
in
the
island
;
so
that
,
before
we
find
any
method
for
our
escape
,
we
have
dry
the
flesh
of
six
or
seven
cow
and
bullock
,
and
ten
or
twelve
goat
,
and
it
relish
so
well
,
that
we
never
give
ourselves
the
trouble
to
boil
it
when
we
eat
it
,
but
either
broil
it
or
eat
it
dry
.
<EOS>
but
our
main
difficulty
about
fresh
water
still
remain
;
for
we
have
no
vessel
to
put
any
into
,
much
less
to
keep
any
for
our
go
to
sea
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
first
voyage
be
only
to
coast
the
island
,
we
resolve
to
venture
,
whatever
the
hazard
or
consequence
of
it
may
be
,
and
in
order
to
preserve
as
much
fresh
water
as
we
could
,
our
carpenter
make
a
well
athwart
the
middle
of
one
of
our
canoe
,
which
he
separate
from
the
other
part
of
the
canoe
,
so
as
to
make
it
tight
to
hold
the
water
and
cover
so
as
we
may
step
upon
it
;
and
this
be
so
large
that
it
hold
near
a
hogshead
of
water
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
better
describe
this
well
than
by
the
same
kind
which
the
small
fishing
-
boat
in
England
have
to
preserve
their
fish
alive
in
;
only
that
this
,
instead
of
have
hole
to
let
the
salt
water
in
,
be
make
sound
every
way
to
keep
it
out
;
and
it
be
the
first
invention
,
I
believe
,
of
its
kind
for
such
an
use
;
but
necessity
be
a
spur
to
ingenuity
and
the
mother
of
invention
.
  
<EOS>
It
want
but
a
little
consultation
to
resolve
now
upon
our
voyage
.
<EOS>
the
first
design
be
only
to
coast
<EOS>
it
round
the
island
,
as
well
to
see
if
we
could
seize
upon
any
vessel
fit
to
embark
ourselves
in
,
as
also
to
take
hold
of
any
opportunity
which
may
present
for
our
pass
over
to
the
main
;
and
therefore
our
resolution
be
to
go
on
the
inside
or
west
shore
of
the
island
,
where
,
at
least
at
one
point
,
the
land
stretch
a
great
way
to
the
north
-
west
,
the
distance
be
not
extraordinary
great
from
the
island
to
the
coast
of
Africa
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
voyage
,
and
with
such
a
desperate
crew
,
I
believe
be
never
make
,
for
it
be
certain
we
take
the
bad
side
of
the
island
to
look
for
any
shipping
,
especially
for
shipping
of
other
nation
,
this
be
quite
out
of
the
way
;
however
,
we
put
to
sea
,
after
take
all
our
provision
and
ammunition
,
bag
and
baggage
,
on
board
;
we
have
make
both
mast
and
sail
for
our
two
large
periaguas
,
and
the
other
we
paddle
along
as
well
as
we
could
;
but
when
a
gale
spring
up
,
we
take
her
in
tow
.
  
<EOS>
We
sail
merrily
forward
for
several
day
,
meet
with
nothing
to
interrupt
us
.
<EOS>
We
see
several
of
the
native
in
small
canoe
catch
fish
,
and
sometimes
we
endeavour
to
come
near
enough
to
speak
with
them
,
but
they
be
always
shy
and
afraid
of
us
,
make
in
for
the
shore
as
soon
as
we
attempt
it
;
till
one
of
our
company
remember
the
signal
of
friendship
which
the
native
make
us
from
the
south
part
of
the
island
,
viz
.
,
of
set
up
a
long
pole
,
and
put
us
in
mind
that
perhaps
it
be
the
same
thing
to
them
as
a
flag
of
truce
to
us
.
<EOS>
so
we
resolve
to
try
it
;
and
accordingly
the
next
time
we
see
any
of
their
fishing
-
boat
at
sea
we
put
up
a
pole
in
our
canoe
that
have
no
sail
,
and
row
towards
them
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
see
the
pole
they
stay
for
us
,
and
as
we
come
nearer
paddle
towards
us
;
when
they
come
to
us
they
show
themselves
very
much
pleased
,
and
give
us
some
large
fish
,
of
which
we
do
not
know
the
name
,
but
they
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
our
misfortune
still
that
we
have
nothing
to
give
them
in
return
;
but
our
artist
,
of
whom
I
speak
before
,
give
them
two
little
thin
plate
of
silver
,
beat
,
as
I
say
before
,
out
of
a
piece
of
eight
;
they
be
cut
in
a
diamond
square
,
longer
one
way
than
the
other
,
and
a
hole
punch
at
one
of
the
long
corner
.
<EOS>
this
they
be
so
fond
of
<EOS>
that
they
make
us
stay
till
they
have
cast
their
line
and
net
again
,
and
give
us
as
many
fish
as
we
care
to
have
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
we
have
our
eye
upon
their
boat
,
view
them
very
narrowly
,
and
examine
whether
any
of
them
be
fit
for
our
turn
,
but
they
be
poor
,
sorry
thing
;
their
sail
be
make
of
a
large
mat
,
only
one
that
be
of
a
piece
of
cotton
stuff
fit
for
little
,
and
their
rope
be
twist
flag
of
no
strength
;
so
we
conclude
we
be
well
as
we
be
,
and
let
them
alone
.
<EOS>
We
go
forward
to
the
north
,
keep
the
coast
close
on
board
for
twelve
day
together
,
and
have
the
wind
at
east
and
E.S.E.
,
we
make
very
fresh
way
.
<EOS>
We
see
no
town
on
the
shore
,
but
often
see
some
hut
by
the
water
-
side
upon
the
rock
,
and
always
abundance
of
people
about
them
,
who
we
could
perceive
run
together
to
stare
at
us
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
odd
a
voyage
as
ever
man
go
;
we
be
a
little
fleet
of
three
ship
,
and
an
army
of
between
twenty
and
thirty
as
dangerous
fellow
as
ever
they
have
amongst
them
;
and
have
they
know
what
we
be
,
they
would
have
compound
to
give
us
everything
we
desire
to
be
rid
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
we
be
as
miserable
as
nature
could
well
make
us
to
be
,
for
we
be
upon
a
voyage
and
no
voyage
,
we
be
bind
somewhere
and
nowhere
;
for
though
we
know
what
we
intend
to
do
,
we
do
really
not
know
what
we
be
do
.
<EOS>
We
go
forward
and
forward
by
a
northerly
course
,
and
as
we
advance
the
heat
increase
,
which
begin
to
be
intolerable
to
us
,
who
be
on
the
water
,
without
any
covering
from
heat
or
wet
;
besides
,
we
be
now
in
the
month
of
October
,
or
thereabout
,
in
a
southern
latitude
;
and
as
we
go
every
day
near
<EOS>
the
sun
,
the
sun
come
also
every
day
near
to
us
,
till
at
last
we
find
ourselves
in
the
latitude
of
20
degree
;
and
have
pass
the
tropic
about
five
or
six
day
before
that
,
in
a
few
day
more
the
sun
would
be
in
the
zenith
,
just
over
our
head
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
consideration
we
resolve
to
seek
for
a
good
place
to
go
on
shore
again
,
and
pitch
our
tent
,
till
the
heat
of
the
weather
abate
.
<EOS>
We
have
by
this
time
measure
half
the
length
of
the
island
,
and
be
come
to
that
part
where
the
shore
tend
away
to
the
north
-
west
,
promise
fair
to
make
our
passage
over
to
the
mainland
of
Africa
much
short
than
we
expect
.
<EOS>
but
,
notwithstanding
that
,
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
it
be
about
120
league
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
the
heat
consider
,
we
resolve
to
take
harbour
;
besides
,
our
provision
be
exhaust
,
and
we
have
not
many
day
'
store
leave
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
put
in
for
the
shore
early
in
the
morning
,
as
we
usually
do
once
in
three
or
four
day
for
fresh
water
,
we
sit
down
and
consider
whether
we
would
go
on
or
take
up
our
stand
there
;
but
upon
several
consideration
,
too
long
to
repeat
here
,
we
do
not
like
the
place
,
so
we
resolve
to
go
on
a
few
day
longer
.
  
<EOS>
after
sail
on
N.W.
by
N.
with
a
fresh
gale
at
S.E.
,
about
six
day
,
we
find
,
at
a
great
distance
,
a
large
promontory
or
cape
of
land
,
push
out
a
long
way
into
the
sea
,
and
as
we
be
exceed
fond
of
see
what
be
beyond
the
cape
,
we
resolve
to
double
it
before
we
take
into
harbour
,
<EOS>
so
we
keep
on
our
way
,
the
gale
continue
,
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
four
day
more
before
we
reach
the
cape
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
possible
to
express
the
discouragement
and
melancholy
that
seize
us
all
when
we
come
thither
;
for
when
we
make
the
headland
of
the
cape
,
we
be
surprised
to
see
the
shore
fall
away
on
the
other
side
as
much
as
it
have
advance
on
this
side
,
and
a
great
deal
more
;
and
that
,
in
short
,
if
we
would
venture
over
to
the
shore
of
Africa
,
it
must
be
from
hence
,
for
that
if
we
go
further
,
the
breadth
of
the
sea
still
increase
,
and
to
what
breadth
it
may
increase
we
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
muse
upon
this
discovery
,
we
be
surprised
with
very
bad
weather
,
and
especially
violent
rain
,
with
thunder
and
lightning
,
most
unusually
terrible
to
us
.
<EOS>
in
this
pickle
we
run
for
the
shore
,
and
get
under
the
lee
of
the
cape
,
run
our
frigate
into
a
little
creek
,
where
we
see
the
land
overgrow
with
tree
,
and
make
all
the
haste
possible
to
get
on
shore
,
be
exceed
wet
,
and
fatigue
with
the
heat
,
the
thunder
,
lightning
,
and
rain
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
think
our
case
be
very
deplorable
indeed
,
and
therefore
our
artist
,
of
whom
I
have
speak
so
often
,
set
up
a
great
cross
of
wood
on
the
hill
which
be
within
a
mile
of
the
headland
,
with
these
word
,
but
in
the
portuguese
language
:
    
"
Point
Desperation
.
<EOS>
Jesus
have
mercy
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
set
to
work
immediately
to
build
us
some
hut
,
and
to
get
our
clothe
dry
;
and
though
I
be
young
and
have
no
skill
in
such
thing
,
yet
I
shall
never
forget
the
little
city
we
build
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
no
less
,
and
we
fortify
it
accordingly
;
and
the
idea
be
so
fresh
in
my
thought
,
that
I
can
not
but
give
a
short
description
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Our
camp
be
on
the
south
side
of
a
little
creek
on
the
sea
,
and
under
the
shelter
of
a
steep
hill
,
which
lie
,
though
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
,
yet
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
us
,
N.W.
by
N.
,
and
very
happily
intercept
the
heat
of
the
sun
<EOS>
all
the
after
part
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
the
spot
we
pitch
on
have
a
little
fresh
water
brook
,
or
a
stream
run
into
the
creek
by
us
;
and
we
see
cattle
feed
in
the
plain
and
low
ground
east
and
to
the
south
of
us
a
great
way
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
set
up
twelve
little
hut
like
soldier
'
tent
,
but
make
of
the
bough
of
tree
stick
in
the
ground
,
and
bind
together
on
the
top
with
withy
,
and
such
other
thing
as
we
could
get
;
the
creek
be
our
defence
on
the
north
,
a
little
brook
on
the
west
,
and
the
south
and
east
side
be
fortify
with
a
bank
,
which
entirely
cover
our
hut
;
and
be
draw
oblique
from
the
north
-
west
to
the
south
-
east
,
make
our
city
a
triangle
.
<EOS>
behind
the
bank
or
line
our
hut
stand
,
have
three
other
hut
behind
them
at
a
good
distance
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
,
which
be
a
little
one
,
and
stand
further
off
,
we
put
our
gunpowder
,
and
nothing
else
,
for
fear
of
danger
;
in
the
other
,
which
be
big
,
we
dress
our
victual
,
and
put
all
our
necessary
;
and
in
the
third
,
which
be
big
of
all
,
we
eat
our
dinner
,
call
our
council
,
and
sit
and
divert
ourselves
with
such
conversation
as
we
have
one
with
another
,
which
be
but
indifferent
truly
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
Our
correspondence
with
the
native
be
absolutely
necessary
,
and
our
artist
the
cutler
have
make
abundance
of
those
little
diamond
-
cut
square
of
silver
,
with
these
we
make
shift
to
traffic
with
the
black
people
for
what
we
want
;
for
indeed
they
be
pleased
wonderfully
with
them
,
and
thus
we
get
plenty
of
provision
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
and
in
particular
,
we
get
about
fifty
head
of
black
cattle
and
goat
,
and
our
cook
's
mate
take
care
to
cure
them
and
dry
them
,
salt
and
preserve
them
for
our
grand
supply
;
nor
be
this
hard
to
do
,
the
salt
and
saltpetre
be
very
good
,
and
the
sun
excessively
hot
;
and
here
we
live
about
four
month
.
  
<EOS>
the
southern
solstice
be
over
,
and
the
sun
go
back
towards
the
equinoctial
,
when
we
consider
of
our
next
adventure
,
which
be
to
go
over
the
sea
of
Zanguebar
,
as
the
Portuguese
call
it
,
and
to
land
,
if
possible
,
upon
the
continent
of
Africa
.
  
<EOS>
We
talk
with
many
of
the
native
about
it
,
such
as
we
could
make
ourselves
intelligible
to
,
but
all
that
we
could
learn
from
them
be
,
that
there
be
a
great
land
of
lion
beyond
the
sea
,
but
that
it
be
a
great
way
off
.
<EOS>
We
know
as
well
as
they
that
it
be
a
long
way
,
but
our
people
differ
mightily
about
it
;
some
say
it
be
150
league
,
other
not
above
100
.
<EOS>
one
of
our
man
,
that
have
a
map
of
the
world
,
show
us
by
his
scale
that
it
be
not
above
eighty
league
.
<EOS>
some
say
there
be
island
all
the
way
to
touch
at
,
some
that
there
be
no
island
at
all
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
know
nothing
of
this
matter
one
way
or
another
,
but
hear
it
all
without
concern
,
whether
it
be
near
or
far
off
;
however
,
this
we
learn
from
an
old
man
who
be
blind
and
lead
about
by
a
boy
,
that
if
we
stay
till
the
end
of
August
,
we
should
be
sure
of
the
wind
to
be
fair
and
the
sea
smooth
all
the
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
some
encouragement
;
but
stay
again
be
very
unwelcome
news
to
us
,
because
that
then
the
sun
would
be
return
again
to
the
south
,
which
be
what
our
man
be
very
unwilling
to
.
<EOS>
at
last
we
call
a
council
of
our
whole
body
;
their
debate
be
too
tedious
to
take
notice
of
,
only
to
note
,
that
when
it
come
to
Captain
Bob
(
for
so
they
call
me
ever
since
I
have
take
state
upon
me
before
one
of
their
great
prince
)
,
truly
I
be
on
no
side
;
it
be
not
one
farthe
matter
to
me
,
I
tell
them
,
whether
we
go
or
stay
;
I
have
no
home
,
and
all
the
world
be
alike
to
me
;
so
I
leave
it
entirely
to
them
to
determine
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
see
plainly
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
where
we
be
without
ship
;
that
if
our
business
indeed
be
only
to
eat
and
drink
,
we
could
not
find
a
well
place
in
the
world
;
but
if
our
business
be
to
get
away
,
and
get
home
into
our
country
,
we
could
not
find
a
bad
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
like
the
country
wonderfully
,
and
even
then
have
strange
notion
of
come
again
to
live
there
;
and
I
use
to
say
to
them
very
often
that
if
I
have
but
a
ship
of
twenty
gun
,
and
a
sloop
,
and
<EOS>
both
well
man
,
I
would
not
desire
a
well
place
in
the
world
to
make
myself
as
rich
as
a
king
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
consultation
they
be
in
about
go
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
it
be
resolve
to
venture
over
for
the
main
;
and
venture
we
do
,
madly
enough
,
indeed
,
for
it
be
the
wrong
time
of
the
year
to
undertake
such
a
voyage
in
that
country
;
for
,
as
the
wind
hang
easterly
all
the
month
from
September
to
March
,
so
they
generally
hang
westerly
all
the
rest
of
the
year
,
and
blow
right
in
our
tooth
;
so
that
,
as
soon
as
we
have
,
with
a
kind
of
a
land
-
breeze
,
stretch
over
about
fifteen
or
twenty
league
,
and
,
as
I
may
say
,
just
enough
to
lose
ourselves
,
we
find
the
wind
set
in
a
steady
fresh
gale
or
breeze
from
the
sea
,
at
west
,
W.S.W.
,
or
S.W.
by
W.
,
and
never
further
from
the
west
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
we
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
vessel
,
such
as
we
have
,
would
not
lie
close
upon
a
wind
;
if
so
,
we
may
have
stretch
away
N.N.W.
,
and
have
meet
with
a
great
many
island
in
our
way
,
as
we
find
afterwards
;
but
we
could
make
nothing
of
it
,
though
we
try
,
and
by
the
try
have
almost
undo
us
all
;
for
,
stretch
away
to
the
north
,
as
near
the
wind
as
we
could
,
we
have
forget
the
shape
and
position
of
the
island
of
Madagascar
itself
;
how
that
we
come
off
at
the
head
of
a
promontory
or
point
of
land
,
that
lie
about
the
middle
of
the
island
,
and
that
stretch
out
west
a
great
way
into
the
sea
;
and
that
now
,
be
run
a
matter
of
forty
league
to
the
north
,
the
shore
of
the
island
fall
off
again
above
200
mile
to
the
east
,
so
that
we
be
by
this
time
in
the
wide
ocean
,
between
the
island
and
the
main
,
and
almost
100
league
from
both
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
the
wind
blow
fresh
at
west
,
as
before
,
we
have
a
smooth
sea
,
and
we
find
it
pretty
good
go
before
it
,
and
so
,
take
our
small
canoe
in
tow
,
we
stand
in
for
the
shore
with
all
the
sail
we
could
make
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
terrible
adventure
,
for
,
<EOS>
if
the
least
gust
of
wind
have
come
,
we
have
be
all
lose
,
our
canoe
be
deep
and
in
no
condition
to
make
way
in
a
high
sea
.
  
<EOS>
this
voyage
,
however
,
hold
us
eleven
day
in
all
;
and
at
length
,
have
spend
most
of
our
provision
,
and
every
drop
of
water
we
have
,
we
spy
land
,
to
our
great
joy
,
though
at
the
distance
of
ten
or
eleven
league
;
and
as
,
under
the
land
,
the
wind
come
off
like
a
land
-
breeze
,
and
blow
hard
against
us
,
we
be
two
day
more
before
we
reach
the
shore
,
have
all
that
while
excessive
hot
weather
,
and
not
a
drop
of
water
or
any
other
liquor
,
except
some
cordial
water
,
which
one
of
our
company
have
a
little
of
leave
in
a
case
of
bottle
.
  
<EOS>
this
give
us
a
taste
of
what
we
should
have
do
if
we
have
venture
forward
with
a
scant
wind
and
uncertain
weather
,
and
give
us
a
surfeit
of
our
design
for
the
main
,
at
least
until
we
may
have
some
well
vessel
under
us
;
so
we
go
on
shore
again
,
and
pitch
our
camp
as
before
,
in
as
convenient
manner
as
we
could
,
fortify
ourselves
against
any
surprise
;
but
the
native
here
be
exceed
courteous
,
and
much
more
civil
than
on
the
south
part
of
the
island
;
and
though
we
could
not
understand
what
they
say
,
or
they
us
,
yet
we
find
mean
to
make
them
understand
that
we
be
seafare
man
and
stranger
,
and
that
we
be
in
distress
for
want
of
provision
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
proof
we
have
of
their
kindness
be
,
that
as
soon
as
they
see
us
come
on
shore
and
begin
to
make
our
habitation
,
one
of
their
captain
or
king
,
for
we
know
not
what
to
call
them
,
come
down
with
five
or
six
man
and
some
woman
,
and
bring
us
five
goat
and
two
young
fat
steer
,
and
give
them
to
us
for
nothing
;
and
when
we
go
to
offer
them
anything
,
the
captain
or
the
king
would
not
let
any
of
them
touch
it
,
or
take
anything
of
us
.
<EOS>
about
two
hour
after
come
another
king
,
or
captain
,
with
forty
or
fifty
man
after
him
.
<EOS>
We
begin
to
be
afraid
of
him
,
and
lay
hand
upon
our
weapon
;
but
he
perceive
it
,
cause
two
man
to
go
before
him
,
carry
two
long
pole
in
their
hand
,
which
they
hold
upright
,
as
high
as
they
could
,
which
we
presently
perceive
be
a
signal
of
peace
;
and
these
two
pole
they
set
up
afterwards
,
stick
them
up
in
the
ground
;
and
when
the
king
and
his
man
come
to
these
two
pole
,
they
strike
all
their
lance
up
in
the
ground
,
and
come
on
unarmed
,
leave
their
lance
,
as
also
their
bow
and
arrow
,
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
to
satisfy
us
that
they
be
come
as
friend
,
and
we
be
glad
to
see
it
,
for
we
have
no
mind
to
quarrel
with
them
if
we
could
help
it
.
<EOS>
the
captain
of
this
gang
see
some
of
our
man
make
up
their
hut
,
and
that
they
do
it
but
<EOS>
bunglingly
,
he
beckon
to
some
of
his
man
to
go
and
help
us
.
<EOS>
immediately
fifteen
or
sixteen
of
them
come
and
mingle
among
us
,
and
go
to
work
for
us
;
and
indeed
,
they
be
well
workman
than
we
be
,
for
they
run
up
three
or
four
hut
for
us
in
a
moment
,
and
much
handsomer
do
than
our
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
they
send
us
milk
,
plantain
,
pumpkin
,
and
abundance
of
root
and
green
that
be
very
good
,
and
then
take
their
leave
,
and
would
not
take
anything
from
us
that
we
have
.
<EOS>
one
of
our
man
offer
the
king
or
captain
of
these
man
a
dram
,
which
he
drink
and
be
mightily
pleased
with
it
,
and
hold
out
his
hand
for
another
,
which
we
give
him
;
and
in
a
word
,
after
this
,
he
hardly
fail
come
to
us
two
or
three
time
a
week
,
always
bring
us
something
or
other
;
and
one
time
send
us
seven
head
of
black
cattle
,
some
of
which
we
cure
and
dry
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
can
not
but
remember
one
thing
,
which
afterwards
stand
us
in
great
stead
,
viz
.
,
that
the
flesh
of
their
goat
,
and
their
beef
also
,
but
especially
the
former
,
when
we
have
dry
and
cure
it
,
look
red
,
and
eat
hard
and
firm
,
as
dry
beef
in
Holland
;
they
be
so
pleased
with
it
,
and
it
be
such
a
dainty
to
them
,
that
at
any
time
after
they
would
trade
with
us
for
it
,
not
know
,
or
so
much
as
imagine
what
it
be
;
so
that
for
ten
or
twelve
pound
'
weight
of
smoke
-
dry
beef
,
they
would
give
us
a
whole
bullock
,
or
cow
,
or
anything
else
we
could
desire
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
observe
two
thing
that
be
very
material
to
us
,
even
essentially
so
;
first
,
we
find
they
have
a
great
deal
of
earthenware
here
,
which
they
make
use
of
many
way
as
we
do
;
particularly
they
have
long
,
deep
earthen
pot
,
which
they
use
to
sink
into
the
ground
,
to
keep
the
water
which
they
drunk
cool
and
pleasant
;
and
the
other
be
,
that
they
have
large
canoe
than
their
neighbour
have
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
we
be
prompt
to
inquire
if
they
have
no
large
vessel
than
those
we
see
there
,
or
if
any
other
of
the
inhabitant
have
not
such
.
<EOS>
They
signify
presently
that
they
have
no
large
boat
than
that
they
show
us
;
but
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
they
have
large
boat
,
and
that
with
deck
upon
them
,
and
large
sail
;
and
this
make
us
resolve
to
coast
round
the
whole
island
to
see
them
;
so
we
prepare
and
victual
our
canoe
for
the
voyage
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
go
to
sea
for
the
third
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
cost
us
a
month
or
six
week
'
time
to
perform
this
voyage
,
in
which
time
we
go
on
shore
several
time
for
water
and
provision
,
and
find
the
native
always
very
free
and
courteous
;
but
we
be
surprise
one
morning
early
,
be
at
the
extremity
of
the
northernmost
part
of
the
island
,
when
one
of
our
man
cry
out
,
"
a
sail
!
<EOS>
a
sail
!
<EOS>
"
We
presently
see
a
vessel
a
great
way
out
at
sea
;
but
after
we
have
look
at
it
with
our
perspective
glass
,
and
endeavour
all
we
could
to
make
out
what
it
be
,
we
could
not
tell
what
to
think
of
it
;
for
it
be
neither
ship
,
ketch
,
galley
,
galliot
,
or
like
anything
that
we
have
ever
see
before
;
all
that
we
could
make
of
it
be
,
that
it
go
from
us
,
stand
out
to
sea
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
soon
lose
sight
of
it
,
for
we
be
in
no
condition
to
chase
anything
,
and
we
never
see
it
again
;
but
,
by
all
that
we
could
perceive
of
it
,
from
what
we
see
of
such
thing
afterwards
,
it
be
some
arabian
vessel
,
which
have
be
trade
to
the
coast
of
Mozambique
,
or
Zanzibar
,
the
same
place
where
we
afterwards
go
,
as
you
shall
hear
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
no
journal
of
this
voyage
,
nor
indeed
do
I
all
this
while
understand
anything
of
navigation
,
more
than
the
common
business
of
a
foremast
-
man
;
so
I
can
say
nothing
to
the
latitude
or
distance
of
any
place
we
be
at
,
how
long
we
be
go
,
or
how
far
we
sail
in
a
day
;
but
this
I
remember
,
that
be
now
come
round
the
island
,
we
sail
up
the
eastern
shore
due
south
,
as
we
have
do
down
the
western
shore
due
north
before
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
I
remember
that
the
native
differ
much
from
one
another
,
either
in
stature
or
complexion
,
or
in
their
manner
,
their
habit
,
their
weapon
,
or
indeed
in
anything
;
and
yet
we
could
not
perceive
that
they
have
any
intelligence
one
with
another
;
but
they
be
extremely
kind
and
civil
to
us
on
this
side
,
as
well
as
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
We
continue
our
voyage
south
for
many
week
,
though
with
several
interval
of
go
on
shore
to
get
provision
and
water
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
come
round
a
point
of
land
which
lie
about
a
league
further
than
ordinary
into
the
sea
,
we
be
agreeably
surprised
with
a
sight
which
,
no
doubt
,
have
be
as
disagreeable
to
those
concern
,
as
it
be
pleasant
to
us
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
wreck
of
an
european
ship
,
which
have
be
cast
away
upon
the
rock
,
which
in
that
place
run
a
great
way
into
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
We
could
see
plainly
,
at
low
water
,
a
great
deal
of
the
ship
lie
dry
;
even
at
high
water
,
she
be
not
entirely
cover
;
and
that
at
most
she
do
not
lie
above
a
league
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
It
will
easily
be
believe
that
our
curiosity
lead
us
,
the
wind
and
weather
also
permit
,
to
go
directly
to
her
,
which
we
do
without
any
difficulty
,
and
presently
find
that
it
be
a
Dutch
-
build
ship
,
and
that
she
could
not
have
be
very
long
in
that
condition
,
a
great
deal
of
the
upper
work
of
her
stern
remain
firm
,
with
the
mizzen
-
mast
standing
.
<EOS>
Her
stern
seem
to
be
jam
in
between
two
ridge
of
the
rock
,
and
so
remain
fast
,
all
the
fore
part
of
the
ship
have
be
beat
to
piece
.
  
<EOS>
We
could
see
nothing
to
be
get
out
of
the
wreck
that
be
worth
our
while
;
but
we
resolve
to
go
on
shore
,
and
stay
some
time
thereabout
,
to
see
if
perhaps
we
may
get
any
light
into
the
story
of
her
;
and
we
be
not
without
hope
that
we
may
hear
something
more
particular
about
her
man
,
and
perhaps
find
some
of
them
on
shore
there
,
in
the
same
condition
that
we
be
in
,
and
so
may
increase
our
company
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
pleasant
sight
to
us
<EOS>
when
,
come
on
shore
,
we
see
all
the
mark
and
token
of
a
ship
-
carpenter
's
yard
;
as
a
launch
-
block
and
cradle
,
scaffold
and
plank
,
and
piece
of
plank
,
the
remain
of
the
building
a
ship
or
vessel
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
a
great
many
thing
that
fairly
invite
us
to
go
about
the
same
work
;
and
we
soon
come
to
understand
that
the
man
belong
to
the
ship
that
be
lose
have
save
themselves
on
shore
,
perhaps
in
their
boat
,
and
have
build
themselves
a
barque
or
sloop
,
and
so
be
go
to
sea
again
;
and
,
<EOS>
inquire
of
the
native
which
way
they
go
,
they
point
to
the
south
and
south
-
west
,
by
which
we
could
easily
understand
they
be
go
away
to
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
.
  
<EOS>
nobody
will
imagine
we
could
be
so
dull
as
not
to
gather
from
hence
that
we
may
take
the
same
method
for
our
escape
;
so
we
resolve
first
,
in
general
,
that
we
would
try
if
possible
to
build
us
a
boat
of
one
kind
or
other
,
and
go
to
sea
as
our
fate
should
direct
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
this
our
first
work
be
to
have
the
two
carpenter
search
about
to
see
what
material
the
dutchman
have
leave
behind
them
that
may
be
of
use
;
and
,
in
particular
,
they
find
one
that
be
very
useful
,
and
which
I
be
much
employ
about
,
and
that
be
a
pitch
-
kettle
,
and
a
little
pitch
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
set
close
to
this
work
we
find
it
very
laborious
and
difficult
,
have
but
<EOS>
few
tool
,
no
ironwork
,
no
cordage
,
no
sail
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
whatever
we
build
,
we
be
oblige
to
be
our
own
smith
,
rope
-
maker
,
sail
-
maker
,
and
indeed
to
practise
twenty
trade
that
we
know
little
or
nothing
of
.
<EOS>
however
,
necessity
be
the
spur
to
invention
,
and
we
do
many
thing
which
before
we
think
impracticable
,
that
be
to
say
,
in
our
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
after
our
two
carpenter
have
resolve
upon
the
dimension
of
what
they
would
build
,
they
set
us
all
to
work
,
to
go
off
in
our
boat
and
split
up
the
wreck
of
the
old
ship
,
and
to
bring
away
everything
we
could
;
and
particularly
that
,
if
possible
,
we
should
bring
away
the
mizzen
-
mast
,
which
be
leave
stand
,
which
with
much
difficulty
we
effect
,
after
above
twenty
day
'
labour
of
fourteen
of
our
man
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
we
get
out
a
great
deal
of
ironwork
,
as
bolt
,
spike
,
nails
,
&
c.
,
all
of
which
our
artist
,
of
whom
I
have
speak
already
,
who
be
now
grow
a
very
dexterous
smith
,
make
us
nail
and
hinge
for
our
rudder
,
and
spike
such
as
we
want
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
want
an
anchor
,
and
if
we
have
have
an
anchor
,
we
could
not
have
make
a
cable
;
so
we
content
ourselves
with
make
some
rope
with
the
help
of
the
native
,
of
such
stuff
as
they
make
their
mat
of
,
and
with
these
we
make
such
a
kind
of
cable
or
tow
-
line
as
be
sufficient
to
fasten
our
vessel
to
the
shore
,
which
we
content
ourselves
with
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
short
,
we
spend
four
month
here
,
and
work
very
hard
too
;
at
the
end
of
which
time
we
launch
our
frigate
,
which
,
in
a
few
word
,
have
many
defect
,
but
<EOS>
yet
,
all
thing
consider
,
it
be
as
well
as
we
could
expect
it
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
a
kind
of
sloop
,
of
the
burthen
of
near
eighteen
or
twenty
ton
;
and
have
we
have
mast
and
sail
,
stand
and
run
rig
,
as
be
usual
in
such
case
,
and
other
convenience
,
the
vessel
may
have
carry
us
wherever
we
could
have
have
a
mind
to
go
;
but
of
all
the
material
we
want
,
this
be
the
bad
,
viz
.
,
that
we
have
no
tar
or
pitch
to
pay
the
seam
and
secure
the
bottom
;
and
though
we
do
what
we
could
,
with
tallow
and
oil
,
to
make
a
mixture
to
supply
that
part
,
yet
we
could
not
bring
it
to
answer
our
end
fully
;
and
when
we
launch
her
into
the
water
,
she
be
so
leaky
,
and
take
in
the
water
so
fast
,
that
we
think
all
our
labour
have
be
lose
,
for
we
have
much
ado
to
make
her
swim
;
and
as
for
pump
,
we
have
none
,
nor
have
we
any
mean
to
make
one
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
length
one
of
the
native
,
a
black
negro
-
man
,
show
us
a
tree
,
the
wood
of
which
be
put
into
the
fire
,
send
forth
a
liquid
that
be
as
glutinous
and
almost
as
strong
as
tar
,
and
of
which
,
by
boil
,
we
make
a
sort
of
stuff
which
serve
us
for
pitch
,
and
this
answer
our
end
effectually
;
for
we
perfectly
make
our
vessel
sound
and
tight
,
so
that
we
want
no
pitch
or
tar
at
all
.
<EOS>
this
secret
have
stand
me
in
stead
upon
many
occasion
since
that
time
in
the
same
place
.
  
<EOS>
Our
vessel
be
thus
finish
,
out
of
the
mizzen
-
mast
of
the
ship
we
make
a
very
good
mast
to
her
,
and
fit
our
sail
to
it
as
well
as
we
could
;
then
we
make
a
rudder
and
tiller
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
everything
that
our
present
necessity
call
upon
us
for
;
and
have
victual
her
,
and
put
as
much
fresh
water
on
board
as
we
think
we
want
,
or
as
we
know
how
to
stow
(
for
we
be
yet
without
cask
)
,
we
put
to
sea
with
a
fair
wind
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
spend
near
another
year
in
these
ramble
,
and
in
this
piece
of
work
;
for
it
be
now
,
as
our
man
say
,
about
the
beginning
of
our
February
,
and
the
sun
go
from
us
apace
,
which
be
much
to
our
satisfaction
,
for
the
heat
be
exceedingly
violent
.
<EOS>
the
wind
,
as
I
say
,
be
fair
;
for
,
as
I
have
since
learn
,
the
wind
generally
spring
up
to
the
eastward
,
as
the
sun
go
from
them
to
the
north
.
  
<EOS>
Our
debate
now
be
,
which
way
we
should
go
,
and
never
be
man
so
irresolute
;
some
be
for
go
to
the
east
,
and
stretch
away
directly
for
the
coast
of
Malabar
;
but
other
,
who
consider
more
seriously
the
length
of
that
voyage
,
shake
their
head
at
the
proposal
,
know
very
well
that
neither
our
provision
,
especially
of
water
,
or
our
vessel
,
be
equal
to
such
a
run
as
that
is
,
of
near
2000
mile
without
any
land
to
touch
at
in
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
these
man
,
too
,
have
all
along
have
a
great
mind
to
a
voyage
for
the
mainland
of
Africa
,
where
they
say
we
should
have
a
fair
cast
for
our
life
,
and
may
be
sure
to
make
ourselves
rich
,
which
way
soever
we
go
,
if
we
be
but
able
to
make
our
way
through
,
whether
by
sea
or
by
land
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
as
the
case
stand
with
us
,
we
have
not
much
choice
for
our
way
;
for
,
if
we
have
resolve
for
the
east
,
we
be
at
the
wrong
season
of
the
year
,
and
must
have
stay
till
April
or
May
before
we
have
go
to
sea
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
as
we
have
the
wind
at
S.E.
and
E.S.E.
,
and
fine
promising
weather
,
we
come
all
into
the
first
proposal
,
and
resolve
for
the
coast
of
Africa
;
nor
be
we
long
in
dispute
as
to
our
coast
the
island
which
we
be
upon
,
for
we
be
now
upon
the
wrong
side
of
the
island
for
the
voyage
we
intend
;
so
we
stand
away
to
the
north
,
and
,
have
round
the
cape
,
we
haul
away
southward
,
under
the
lee
of
the
island
,
think
to
reach
the
west
point
of
land
,
which
,
as
I
observe
before
,
run
out
so
far
towards
the
coast
of
Africa
,
as
would
have
shorten
our
run
almost
100
league
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
have
sail
about
thirty
league
,
we
find
the
wind
variable
under
the
shore
,
and
right
against
us
,
so
we
conclude
to
stand
over
directly
,
for
then
we
have
the
wind
fair
,
and
our
vessel
be
but
very
ill
fate
to
lie
near
the
wind
,
or
any
way
indeed
<EOS>
but
just
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
resolve
upon
it
,
therefore
,
we
put
into
the
shore
to
furnish
ourselves
again
with
fresh
water
and
other
provision
,
and
about
the
latter
end
of
March
,
with
more
courage
than
discretion
,
more
resolution
than
judgment
,
we
launch
for
the
main
coast
of
Africa
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
have
no
anxiety
about
it
,
so
that
we
have
<EOS>
but
a
view
of
reach
some
land
or
other
<EOS>
,
I
care
not
what
or
where
it
be
to
be
,
have
at
this
time
no
view
of
what
be
before
me
,
nor
much
thought
of
what
may
or
may
not
befall
me
;
but
with
as
little
consideration
as
any
one
can
be
suppose
to
have
at
my
age
,
I
consent
to
everything
that
be
propose
,
however
hazardous
the
thing
itself
,
however
improbable
the
success
.
  
<EOS>
the
voyage
,
as
it
be
undertake
with
a
great
deal
of
ignorance
and
desperation
,
so
really
it
be
not
carry
on
with
much
resolution
or
judgment
;
for
we
know
no
more
of
the
course
we
be
to
steer
than
this
,
that
it
be
anywhere
about
the
west
,
within
two
or
three
point
N.
or
S.
,
and
as
we
have
no
compass
with
us
but
a
little
brass
pocket
compass
,
which
one
of
our
man
have
more
by
accident
than
otherwise
,
so
we
could
not
be
very
exact
in
our
course
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
it
please
God
that
the
wind
continue
fair
at
S.E.
and
by
E.
,
we
find
that
N.W.
by
W.
,
which
be
right
afore
it
,
be
as
good
a
course
for
us
as
any
we
could
go
,
and
thus
we
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
voyage
be
much
long
than
we
expect
;
our
vessel
also
,
which
have
no
sail
that
be
proportion
to
her
,
make
but
very
little
way
in
the
sea
,
and
sail
heavily
.
<EOS>
We
have
,
indeed
,
no
great
adventure
happen
in
this
voyage
,
be
out
of
the
way
of
everything
that
could
offer
to
divert
us
;
and
as
for
see
any
vessel
,
we
have
not
the
least
occasion
to
hail
anything
in
all
the
voyage
;
for
we
see
not
one
vessel
,
small
or
great
,
the
sea
we
be
upon
be
entirely
out
of
the
way
of
all
commerce
;
for
the
people
of
Madagascar
know
no
more
of
the
shore
of
Africa
than
we
do
,
only
that
there
be
a
country
of
lion
,
as
they
call
it
,
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
be
eight
or
nine
day
under
sail
,
with
a
fair
wind
,
when
,
to
our
great
joy
,
one
of
our
man
cry
out
"
land
!
<EOS>
"
We
have
great
reason
to
be
glad
of
the
discovery
,
for
we
have
not
water
enough
leave
for
above
two
or
three
day
more
,
though
at
a
short
allowance
.
<EOS>
however
,
though
it
be
early
in
the
morning
when
we
discover
it
,
we
make
it
near
night
before
we
reach
it
,
the
wind
slacken
almost
to
a
calm
,
and
our
ship
be
,
as
I
say
,
a
very
dull
sailer
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
sadly
baulk
upon
our
come
to
the
land
,
when
we
find
that
,
instead
of
the
mainland
of
Africa
,
it
be
only
a
little
island
,
with
no
inhabitant
upon
it
,
at
least
none
that
we
could
find
;
nor
any
cattle
,
except
a
few
goat
,
of
which
we
kill
three
only
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
serve
us
for
fresh
meat
,
and
we
find
very
good
water
;
and
it
be
fifteen
day
more
before
we
reach
the
main
,
which
,
however
,
at
last
we
arrive
at
,
and
which
be
most
essential
to
us
,
as
we
come
to
it
just
as
all
our
provision
be
spend
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
may
say
they
be
spend
first
,
for
we
have
but
a
pint
of
water
a
day
to
each
man
for
the
last
two
day
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
our
great
joy
,
we
see
the
land
,
though
at
a
great
distance
,
the
evening
before
,
and
by
a
pleasant
gale
in
the
night
be
by
morning
within
two
league
of
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
We
never
scruple
go
ashore
at
the
first
place
we
come
at
,
though
,
have
we
have
patience
,
we
may
have
find
a
very
fine
river
a
little
farther
north
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
keep
our
frigate
on
float
by
the
help
of
two
great
pole
,
which
we
fasten
into
the
ground
to
moor
her
,
like
pole
;
and
the
little
weak
rope
,
which
,
as
I
say
,
we
have
make
of
matting
,
serve
us
well
enough
to
make
the
vessel
fast
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
have
view
the
country
a
little
,
get
fresh
water
,
and
furnish
ourselves
with
some
victual
,
which
we
find
very
scarce
here
,
we
go
on
board
again
with
our
store
.
<EOS>
all
we
get
for
provision
be
some
fowl
that
we
kill
,
and
a
kind
of
wild
buffalo
or
bull
,
very
small
,
but
good
meat
;
I
say
,
have
get
these
thing
on
board
,
we
resolve
to
sail
along
the
coast
,
which
lie
N.N.E.
,
till
we
find
some
creek
or
river
,
that
we
may
run
up
into
the
country
,
or
some
town
or
people
;
for
we
have
reason
enough
to
know
the
place
be
inhabit
,
because
we
several
time
see
fire
in
the
night
,
and
smoke
in
the
day
,
every
way
at
a
distance
from
us
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
we
come
to
a
very
large
bay
,
and
in
it
several
little
creek
or
river
empty
themselves
into
the
sea
,
and
we
run
boldly
into
the
first
creek
we
come
at
;
where
,
see
some
hut
and
wild
people
about
them
on
the
shore
,
we
run
our
vessel
into
a
little
cove
on
the
north
side
of
the
creek
,
and
hold
up
a
long
pole
,
with
a
white
bit
of
cloth
on
it
,
for
a
signal
of
peace
to
them
.
<EOS>
We
find
they
understand
us
presently
,
for
they
come
flock
to
us
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
most
of
them
,
of
both
sex
,
stark
naked
.
<EOS>
at
first
they
stand
wonder
and
stare
at
us
,
as
if
we
have
be
monster
,
and
as
if
they
have
be
fright
;
but
we
find
they
inclined
to
be
familiar
with
us
afterwards
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
we
do
to
try
them
,
be
,
we
hold
up
our
hand
to
our
mouth
,
as
if
we
be
to
drink
,
signify
that
we
want
water
.
<EOS>
this
they
understand
presently
,
and
three
of
their
woman
and
two
boy
run
away
up
the
land
,
and
come
back
in
about
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
with
several
pot
,
make
of
earth
,
pretty
enough
,
and
bake
,
I
suppose
,
in
the
sun
;
these
they
bring
us
full
of
water
,
and
set
them
down
near
the
sea
-
shore
,
and
there
leave
them
,
go
back
a
little
,
that
we
may
fetch
them
,
which
we
do
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
,
they
bring
us
root
and
herb
,
and
some
fruit
which
I
can
not
remember
,
and
give
us
;
but
as
we
have
nothing
to
give
them
,
we
find
them
not
so
free
as
the
people
in
Madagascar
be
.
<EOS>
however
,
our
cutler
go
to
work
,
and
,
as
he
have
save
some
iron
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
,
he
make
abundance
of
toy
,
bird
,
dog
,
pin
,
hook
,
and
ring
;
and
we
help
to
file
them
,
and
make
them
bright
for
him
,
and
when
we
give
them
some
of
these
,
they
bring
us
all
sort
of
provision
they
have
,
such
as
goat
,
hog
,
and
cow
,
and
we
get
victual
enough
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
land
upon
the
continent
of
Africa
,
the
most
desolate
,
desert
,
and
inhospitable
country
in
the
world
,
even
Greenland
and
Nova
Zembla
itself
not
except
,
with
this
difference
only
,
that
even
the
bad
part
of
it
we
find
inhabit
,
though
,
take
the
nature
and
quality
of
some
of
the
inhabitant
,
it
may
have
be
much
well
to
us
if
there
have
be
none
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
to
add
to
the
exclamation
I
be
make
on
the
nature
of
the
place
,
it
be
here
that
we
take
one
of
the
rash
,
and
wildest
,
and
most
desperate
resolution
that
ever
be
take
by
man
,
or
any
number
of
man
,
in
the
world
;
this
be
,
to
travel
overland
through
the
heart
of
the
country
,
from
the
coast
of
Mozambique
,
on
the
east
ocean
,
to
the
coast
of
Angola
or
Guinea
,
on
the
western
or
Atlantic
Ocean
,
a
continent
of
land
of
at
least
1800
mile
,
in
which
journey
we
have
excessive
heat
to
support
,
unpassable
desert
to
go
over
,
no
carriage
,
camel
,
or
beast
of
any
kind
to
carry
our
baggage
,
innumerable
number
of
wild
and
ravenous
beast
to
encounter
with
,
such
as
lion
,
leopard
,
tiger
,
lizard
,
and
elephant
;
we
have
the
equinoctial
line
to
pass
under
,
and
,
consequently
,
be
in
the
very
centre
of
the
torrid
zone
;
we
have
nation
of
savage
to
encounter
with
,
barbarous
and
brutish
to
the
last
degree
;
hunger
and
thirst
to
struggle
with
,
and
,
in
one
word
,
terror
enough
to
have
daunt
the
stout
heart
that
ever
be
place
in
case
of
flesh
and
blood
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
fearless
of
all
these
,
we
resolve
to
adventure
,
and
accordingly
make
such
preparation
for
our
journey
as
the
place
we
be
in
would
allow
us
,
and
such
as
our
little
experience
of
the
country
seem
to
dictate
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
some
time
already
that
we
have
be
use
to
tread
barefoote
upon
the
rock
,
the
gravel
,
the
grass
,
and
the
sand
on
the
shore
;
but
as
we
find
the
bad
thing
for
our
foot
be
the
walking
or
travel
on
the
dry
burn
sand
,
within
the
country
,
so
we
provide
ourselves
with
a
sort
of
shoe
,
make
of
the
skin
of
wild
beast
,
with
the
hair
inward
,
and
be
dry
in
the
sun
,
the
outside
be
thick
and
hard
,
and
would
last
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
as
I
call
them
,
so
I
think
the
term
very
proper
still
,
we
make
us
glove
for
our
foot
,
and
we
find
them
very
convenient
and
very
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
We
converse
with
some
of
the
native
of
the
country
,
who
be
friendly
enough
.
<EOS>
what
tongue
they
speak
I
do
not
yet
pretend
to
know
.
<EOS>
We
talk
as
far
as
we
could
make
them
understand
us
,
not
only
about
our
provision
,
but
also
about
our
undertaking
,
and
ask
them
what
country
lie
that
way
,
point
west
with
our
hand
.
<EOS>
They
tell
us
but
little
to
our
purpose
,
only
we
think
,
by
all
their
discourse
,
that
there
be
people
to
be
find
,
of
one
sort
or
other
,
everywhere
;
that
there
be
many
great
river
,
many
lion
and
tiger
,
elephant
,
and
furious
wild
cat
(
which
in
the
end
we
find
to
be
civet
cat
)
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
ask
them
if
any
one
have
ever
travel
that
way
,
they
tell
us
yes
,
some
have
go
to
where
the
sun
sleep
,
mean
to
the
west
,
but
they
could
not
tell
us
who
they
be
.
<EOS>
when
we
ask
for
some
to
guide
us
,
they
shrink
up
their
shoulder
as
frenchman
do
when
they
be
afraid
to
undertake
a
thing
.
<EOS>
when
we
ask
them
about
the
lion
and
wild
creature
,
they
laugh
,
and
let
us
know
that
they
would
do
us
no
hurt
,
and
direct
us
to
a
good
way
indeed
to
deal
with
them
,
and
that
be
to
make
some
fire
,
which
would
always
fright
them
away
;
and
so
indeed
we
find
it
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
encouragement
we
resolve
upon
our
journey
,
and
many
consideration
put
us
upon
it
,
which
,
have
the
thing
itself
be
practicable
,
we
be
not
so
much
to
blame
for
as
it
may
otherwise
be
suppose
;
I
will
name
some
of
them
,
not
to
make
the
account
too
tedious
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
we
be
perfectly
destitute
of
mean
to
work
about
our
own
deliverance
any
other
way
;
we
be
on
shore
in
a
place
perfectly
remote
from
all
european
navigation
;
so
that
we
could
never
think
of
be
relieve
,
and
fetch
off
by
any
of
our
own
countryman
in
that
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
if
we
have
adventure
to
have
sail
on
along
the
coast
of
Mozambique
,
and
the
desolate
shore
of
Africa
to
the
north
,
till
we
come
to
the
Red
Sea
,
all
we
could
hope
for
there
be
to
be
take
by
the
Arabs
,
and
be
sell
for
slave
to
the
Turks
,
which
to
all
of
us
be
little
well
than
death
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
build
anything
of
a
vessel
that
would
carry
us
over
the
great
Arabian
Sea
to
India
,
nor
could
we
reach
the
Cape
de
Bona
Speranza
,
the
wind
be
too
variable
,
and
the
sea
in
that
latitude
too
tempestuous
;
but
we
all
know
,
if
we
could
cross
this
continent
of
land
,
we
may
reach
some
of
the
great
river
that
run
into
the
Atlantic
Ocean
;
and
that
,
on
the
bank
of
any
of
those
river
,
we
may
there
build
us
canoe
which
would
carry
us
down
,
if
it
be
thousand
of
mile
,
so
that
we
could
want
nothing
but
food
,
of
which
we
be
assure
we
may
kill
sufficient
with
our
gun
;
and
to
add
to
the
satisfaction
of
our
deliverance
,
we
conclude
we
may
,
every
one
of
us
,
get
a
quantity
of
gold
,
which
,
if
we
come
safe
,
would
infinitely
recompense
us
for
our
toil
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
in
all
our
consultation
I
ever
begin
to
enter
into
the
weight
and
merit
of
any
enterprise
we
go
upon
till
now
.
<EOS>
My
view
before
be
,
as
I
think
,
very
good
,
viz
.
,
that
we
should
get
into
the
Arabian
Gulf
,
or
the
mouth
of
the
Red
Sea
;
and
wait
for
some
vessel
pass
or
repasse
there
,
of
which
there
be
plenty
,
have
seize
upon
the
first
we
come
at
by
force
,
and
not
only
have
enrich
ourselves
with
her
cargo
,
but
have
carry
ourselves
to
what
part
of
the
world
we
have
please
;
but
when
they
come
to
talk
to
me
of
a
march
of
2000
or
3000
mile
on
foot
,
of
wander
in
desert
among
lion
and
tiger
,
I
confess
my
blood
run
chill
,
and
I
use
all
the
argument
I
could
to
persuade
them
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
be
all
positive
,
and
I
may
as
well
have
hold
my
tongue
;
so
I
submit
,
and
tell
them
I
would
keep
to
our
first
law
,
to
be
govern
by
the
majority
,
and
we
resolve
upon
our
journey
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
we
do
be
to
take
an
observation
,
and
see
whereabout
in
the
world
we
be
,
which
we
do
,
and
find
we
be
in
the
latitude
of
12
degree
35
minute
south
of
the
line
.
<EOS>
the
next
thing
be
to
look
on
the
chart
,
and
see
the
coast
of
the
country
we
aim
at
,
which
we
find
to
be
from
8
to
11
degree
south
latitude
,
if
we
go
for
the
coast
of
Angola
,
or
in
12
to
29
degree
north
latitude
,
if
we
make
for
the
river
Niger
,
and
the
coast
of
Guinea
.
  
<EOS>
Our
aim
be
for
the
coast
of
Angola
,
which
,
by
the
chart
we
have
,
lie
very
near
the
same
latitude
we
be
then
in
,
our
course
thither
be
due
west
;
and
as
we
be
assure
we
should
meet
with
river
,
we
doubt
not
but
that
by
their
help
we
may
ease
our
journey
,
especially
if
we
could
find
mean
to
cross
the
great
lake
,
or
inland
sea
,
which
the
native
call
Coalmucoa
,
<EOS>
out
of
which
it
be
say
the
river
Nile
have
its
source
or
beginning
;
but
we
reckon
without
our
host
,
as
you
will
see
in
the
sequel
of
our
story
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
thing
we
have
to
consider
be
,
how
to
carry
our
baggage
,
which
we
be
first
of
all
determined
not
to
travel
without
;
neither
indeed
be
it
possible
for
us
to
do
so
,
for
even
our
ammunition
,
which
be
absolutely
necessary
to
us
,
and
on
which
our
subsistence
,
I
mean
for
food
,
as
well
as
our
safety
,
and
particularly
our
defence
against
wild
beast
and
wild
man
,
depend
,
 
I
say
,
even
our
ammunition
be
a
load
too
heavy
for
us
to
carry
in
a
country
where
the
heat
be
such
that
we
should
be
load
enough
for
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
We
inquire
in
the
country
,
and
find
there
be
no
beast
of
burthen
know
among
them
,
that
be
to
say
,
neither
horse
or
mule
,
or
ass
,
camel
,
or
dromedary
;
the
only
creature
they
have
be
a
kind
of
buffalo
,
or
tame
bull
,
such
a
one
as
we
have
kill
;
and
that
some
of
these
they
have
bring
so
to
their
hand
,
that
they
teach
them
to
go
and
come
with
their
voice
,
as
they
call
them
to
them
,
or
send
them
from
them
;
that
they
make
them
carry
burthen
;
and
particularly
that
they
would
swim
over
river
and
lake
upon
them
,
the
creature
swim
very
high
and
strong
in
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
understand
nothing
of
the
management
of
guide
such
a
creature
,
or
how
to
bind
a
burthen
upon
them
;
and
this
last
part
of
our
consultation
puzzle
us
extremely
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
propose
a
method
for
them
,
which
,
after
some
consideration
,
they
find
very
convenient
;
and
this
be
,
to
quarrel
with
some
of
the
negro
native
,
take
ten
or
twelve
of
them
prisoner
,
and
bind
them
as
slave
,
cause
them
to
travel
with
us
,
and
make
them
carry
our
baggage
;
which
I
allege
would
be
convenient
and
useful
many
way
as
well
to
show
us
the
way
,
as
to
converse
with
other
native
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
this
counsel
be
not
accept
at
first
,
but
the
native
soon
give
them
reason
to
approve
it
,
and
also
give
them
an
opportunity
to
put
it
in
practice
;
for
,
as
our
little
traffic
with
the
native
be
hitherto
upon
the
faith
of
their
first
kindness
,
we
find
some
knavery
among
them
at
last
;
for
have
buy
some
cattle
of
them
for
our
toy
,
which
,
as
I
say
,
our
cutler
have
contrive
,
one
of
our
man
differ
with
his
chapman
,
truly
they
huff
him
in
their
manner
,
and
,
keep
the
thing
he
have
offer
them
for
the
cattle
,
make
their
fellow
drive
away
the
cattle
before
his
face
,
and
laugh
at
him
.
<EOS>
Our
man
cry
out
loud
of
this
violence
,
and
call
to
some
of
us
who
be
not
far
off
,
the
negro
he
be
deal
with
throw
a
lance
at
him
,
which
come
so
true
,
that
,
if
he
have
not
with
great
agility
jump
aside
,
and
hold
up
his
hand
also
to
turn
the
lance
as
it
come
,
it
have
strike
through
his
body
;
and
,
as
it
be
,
it
wound
him
in
the
arm
;
at
which
the
man
,
enrage
,
take
up
his
fuzee
,
and
shoot
the
negro
through
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
that
be
near
him
,
and
all
those
that
be
with
us
at
a
distance
,
be
so
terribly
fright
,
first
,
at
the
flash
of
fire
;
secondly
,
at
the
noise
;
and
thirdly
,
at
see
their
countryman
kill
,
that
they
stand
like
man
stupid
and
amazed
,
at
first
,
for
some
time
;
but
after
they
be
a
little
recover
from
their
fright
,
one
of
them
,
at
a
good
distance
from
us
,
set
up
a
sudden
scream
noise
,
which
,
it
seem
,
be
the
noise
they
make
when
they
go
to
fight
;
and
all
the
rest
understanding
what
he
mean
,
answer
him
,
and
run
together
to
the
place
where
he
be
,
and
we
not
know
what
it
mean
,
stand
still
,
look
upon
one
another
like
a
parcel
of
fool
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
be
presently
undeceived
;
for
,
in
two
or
three
minute
more
,
we
hear
the
scream
roar
noise
go
on
from
one
place
to
another
,
through
all
their
little
town
;
nay
,
even
over
the
creek
to
the
other
side
;
and
,
on
a
sudden
,
we
see
a
naked
multitude
run
from
all
part
to
the
place
where
the
first
man
begin
it
,
as
to
a
rendezvous
;
and
,
in
less
than
an
hour
,
I
believe
there
be
near
500
of
them
get
together
,
arm
some
with
bow
and
arrow
,
but
most
with
lance
,
which
they
throw
at
a
good
distance
,
so
nicely
that
they
will
strike
a
bird
fly
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
but
a
very
little
time
for
consultation
,
for
the
multitude
be
increase
every
moment
;
and
I
verily
believe
,
if
we
have
stay
long
,
they
would
have
be
10,000
together
in
a
little
time
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
to
do
,
therefore
,
but
to
fly
to
our
ship
or
bark
,
where
indeed
we
could
have
defend
ourselves
very
well
,
or
to
advance
and
try
what
a
volley
or
two
of
small
shot
would
do
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
resolve
immediately
upon
the
latter
,
depend
upon
it
that
the
fire
and
terror
of
our
shot
would
soon
put
them
to
flight
;
so
we
draw
up
all
in
a
line
,
and
march
boldly
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
stand
ready
to
meet
us
,
depend
,
I
suppose
,
to
destroy
us
all
with
their
lance
;
but
before
we
come
near
enough
for
them
to
throw
their
lance
,
we
halt
,
and
,
stand
at
a
good
distance
from
one
another
,
to
stretch
our
line
as
far
as
we
could
<EOS>
,
we
give
them
a
salute
with
our
shot
,
which
,
besides
what
we
wound
that
we
know
not
of
,
knock
sixteen
of
them
down
upon
the
spot
,
and
three
more
be
so
lame
,
that
they
fall
about
twenty
or
thirty
yard
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
have
fire
,
they
set
up
the
horrid
yell
,
or
howling
,
partly
raise
by
those
that
be
wound
,
and
partly
by
those
that
pity
and
condole
the
body
they
see
lie
dead
,
that
I
never
hear
anything
like
it
before
or
since
.
  
<EOS>
We
stand
stock
still
after
we
have
fire
,
to
load
our
gun
again
,
and
find
they
do
not
stir
from
the
place
we
fire
among
them
again
;
we
kill
about
nine
of
them
at
the
second
fire
;
but
as
they
do
not
stand
so
thick
as
before
,
all
our
man
do
not
fire
,
seven
of
us
be
order
to
reserve
our
charge
,
and
to
advance
as
soon
as
the
other
have
fire
,
while
the
rest
load
again
;
of
which
I
shall
speak
again
presently
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
have
fire
the
second
volley
,
we
shout
as
loud
as
we
could
,
and
the
seven
man
advance
upon
them
,
and
,
come
about
twenty
yard
near
,
fire
again
,
and
those
that
be
behind
have
load
again
with
all
expedition
,
follow
;
but
when
they
see
us
advance
,
they
run
scream
away
as
if
they
be
bewitch
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
up
to
the
field
of
battle
,
we
see
a
great
number
of
body
lie
upon
the
ground
,
many
more
than
we
could
suppose
be
kill
or
wound
;
nay
,
more
than
we
have
bullet
in
our
piece
when
we
fire
;
and
we
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
it
;
but
at
length
we
find
how
it
be
,
viz
.
,
that
they
be
fright
out
of
all
manner
of
sense
;
nay
,
I
do
believe
several
of
those
that
be
really
dead
,
be
fright
to
death
,
and
have
no
wound
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
of
those
that
be
thus
fright
,
as
I
have
say
,
several
of
them
,
as
they
recover
themselves
,
come
and
worship
us
(
take
us
for
god
or
devil
,
I
know
not
which
,
nor
do
it
much
matter
to
us
)
:
<EOS>
some
kneel
,
<EOS>
some
throw
themselves
flat
on
the
ground
,
make
a
thousand
antic
gesture
,
but
all
with
token
of
the
most
profound
submission
.
<EOS>
It
presently
come
into
my
head
,
that
we
may
now
,
by
the
law
of
arm
,
take
as
many
prisoner
as
we
would
,
and
make
them
travel
with
us
,
and
carry
our
baggage
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
propose
it
,
our
man
be
all
of
my
mind
;
and
accordingly
we
secure
about
sixty
lusty
young
fellow
,
and
let
them
know
they
must
go
with
us
;
which
they
seem
very
willing
to
do
.
<EOS>
but
the
next
question
we
have
among
ourselves
,
be
,
how
we
should
do
to
trust
them
,
for
we
find
the
people
not
like
those
of
Madagascar
,
but
fierce
,
revengeful
,
and
treacherous
;
for
which
reason
we
be
sure
that
we
should
have
no
service
from
them
but
<EOS>
that
of
mere
slave
;
no
subjection
that
would
continue
any
longer
than
the
fear
of
us
be
upon
them
,
nor
any
labour
but
by
violence
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
go
any
farther
,
I
must
hint
to
the
reader
,
that
from
this
time
forward
I
begin
to
enter
a
little
more
seriously
into
the
circumstance
I
be
in
,
and
concern
myself
more
in
the
conduct
of
our
affair
;
for
though
my
comrade
be
all
old
man
,
yet
I
begin
to
find
them
void
of
counsel
,
or
,
as
I
now
call
it
,
presence
of
mind
,
when
they
come
to
the
execution
of
a
thing
.
<EOS>
the
first
occasion
I
take
to
observe
this
,
be
in
their
late
engagement
with
the
native
,
when
,
though
they
have
take
a
good
resolution
to
attack
them
and
fire
upon
them
,
yet
,
when
they
have
fire
the
first
time
,
and
find
that
the
negro
do
not
run
as
they
expect
,
their
heart
begin
to
fail
,
and
I
be
persuade
,
if
their
bark
have
be
near
hand
,
they
would
every
man
have
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
occasion
I
begin
to
take
upon
me
a
little
to
hearten
them
up
,
and
to
call
upon
them
to
load
again
,
and
give
them
another
volley
,
tell
them
that
I
would
engage
,
if
they
would
be
rule
by
me
,
I
would
make
the
negro
run
fast
enough
.
<EOS>
I
find
this
hearten
them
,
and
therefore
,
when
they
fire
a
second
time
,
I
desire
them
to
reserve
some
of
their
shot
for
an
attempt
by
itself
,
as
I
mention
above
.
  
<EOS>
have
fire
a
second
time
,
I
be
indeed
force
to
command
,
as
I
may
call
it
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
seignior
,
"
say
I
,
"
let
us
give
them
a
cheer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
open
my
throat
,
and
shout
three
time
,
as
our
english
sailor
do
on
like
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
follow
me
,
"
say
I
to
the
seven
that
have
not
fire
,
"
and
I
will
warrant
you
we
will
make
work
with
them
,
"
and
<EOS>
so
it
prove
indeed
;
for
,
as
soon
as
they
see
us
come
,
away
they
run
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
day
forward
they
would
call
me
nothing
but
Seignior
Capitanio
;
but
I
tell
them
I
would
not
be
call
seignior
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
"
say
the
gunner
,
who
speak
good
English
,
"
you
shall
be
call
Captain
Bob
;
"
and
so
they
give
me
my
title
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
more
certain
of
the
Portuguese
than
this
,
take
them
nationally
or
personally
,
if
they
be
animate
and
hearten
up
by
anybody
to
go
before
,
and
encourage
them
by
example
,
they
will
behave
well
enough
;
but
if
they
have
nothing
but
their
own
measure
to
follow
,
they
sink
immediately
:
these
man
have
certainly
flee
from
a
parcel
of
naked
savage
,
though
even
by
fly
they
could
not
have
save
their
life
,
if
I
have
not
shout
and
hallooed
,
and
rather
make
sport
with
the
thing
than
a
fight
,
to
keep
up
their
courage
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
there
less
need
of
it
upon
several
occasion
hereafter
;
and
I
do
confess
I
have
often
wonder
how
a
number
of
man
,
who
,
when
they
come
to
the
extremity
,
be
so
ill
support
by
their
own
spirit
,
have
at
first
courage
to
propose
and
to
undertake
the
most
desperate
and
impracticable
attempt
that
ever
man
go
about
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
indeed
two
or
three
indefatigable
man
among
them
,
by
whose
courage
and
industry
all
the
rest
be
uphold
;
and
indeed
those
two
or
three
be
the
manager
of
them
from
the
beginning
;
that
be
the
gunner
,
and
that
cutler
whom
I
call
the
artist
;
and
the
third
,
who
be
pretty
well
,
though
not
like
either
of
them
,
be
one
of
the
carpenter
.
<EOS>
these
indeed
be
the
life
and
soul
of
all
the
rest
,
and
it
be
to
their
courage
that
all
the
rest
owe
the
resolution
they
show
upon
any
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
when
those
see
me
take
a
little
upon
me
,
as
above
,
they
embrace
me
,
and
treat
me
with
particular
affection
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
this
gunner
be
an
excellent
mathematician
,
a
good
scholar
,
and
a
complete
sailor
;
and
it
be
in
converse
intimately
with
him
that
I
learn
afterwards
the
ground
of
what
knowledge
I
have
since
have
in
all
the
science
useful
for
navigation
,
and
particularly
in
the
geographical
part
of
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
even
in
our
conversation
,
find
me
eager
to
understand
and
learn
,
he
lay
the
foundation
of
a
general
knowledge
of
thing
in
my
mind
,
give
me
just
idea
of
the
form
of
the
earth
and
of
the
sea
,
the
situation
of
country
,
the
course
of
river
,
the
doctrine
of
the
sphere
,
the
motion
of
the
star
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
teach
me
a
kind
of
system
of
astronomy
,
which
I
afterwards
improve
.
  
<EOS>
in
an
especial
manner
,
he
fill
my
head
with
aspire
thought
,
and
with
an
earnest
desire
after
learn
everything
that
could
be
teach
me
;
convince
me
,
that
nothing
could
qualify
me
for
great
undertaking
,
but
a
degree
of
learn
superior
to
what
be
usual
in
the
race
of
seaman
;
he
tell
me
,
that
to
be
ignorant
be
to
be
certain
of
a
mean
station
in
the
world
,
but
that
knowledge
be
the
first
step
to
preferment
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
flatter
me
with
my
capacity
to
learn
;
and
though
that
feed
my
pride
,
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
as
I
have
a
secret
ambition
,
which
just
at
that
time
feed
itself
in
my
mind
,
it
prompt
in
me
an
insatiable
thirst
after
learn
in
general
,
and
<EOS>
I
resolve
,
if
ever
I
come
back
to
Europe
,
and
have
anything
leave
to
purchase
it
,
I
would
make
myself
master
of
all
the
part
of
learn
needful
to
the
making
of
me
a
complete
sailor
;
but
I
be
not
so
just
to
myself
afterwards
as
to
do
it
when
I
have
an
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
our
business
;
the
gunner
,
when
he
see
the
service
I
have
do
in
the
fight
,
and
hear
my
proposal
for
keep
a
number
of
prisoner
for
our
march
,
and
for
carry
our
baggage
,
turn
to
me
before
them
all
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Bob
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
think
you
must
be
our
leader
,
for
all
the
success
of
this
enterprise
be
owe
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
not
compliment
me
;
you
shall
be
our
Seignior
Capitanio
<EOS>
,
you
shall
be
general
;
I
be
too
young
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
so
,
in
short
,
we
all
agree
he
should
be
our
leader
;
but
he
would
not
accept
of
it
alone
,
but
would
have
me
join
with
him
;
and
all
the
rest
agree
,
I
be
oblige
to
comply
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
piece
of
service
they
put
me
upon
in
this
new
command
be
as
difficult
as
any
they
could
think
of
,
and
that
be
to
manage
the
prisoner
;
which
,
however
,
I
cheerfully
undertake
,
as
you
shall
hear
presently
.
<EOS>
but
the
immediate
consultation
be
yet
of
more
consequence
;
and
that
be
,
first
,
which
way
we
should
go
;
and
secondly
,
how
to
furnish
ourselves
for
the
voyage
with
provision
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
among
the
prisoner
one
tall
,
well
-
shape
,
handsome
fellow
,
to
whom
the
rest
seem
to
pay
great
respect
,
and
who
,
as
we
understand
afterwards
,
be
the
son
of
one
of
their
king
;
his
father
be
,
it
seem
,
kill
at
our
first
volley
,
and
he
wound
with
a
shot
in
his
arm
,
and
with
another
just
on
one
of
his
hip
or
haunch
.
<EOS>
the
shot
in
his
haunch
be
in
a
fleshy
part
,
bleed
much
,
and
he
be
half
dead
with
the
loss
of
blood
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
shot
in
his
arm
,
it
have
break
his
wrist
,
and
he
be
by
both
these
wound
quite
disabled
,
so
that
we
be
once
go
to
turn
him
away
,
and
let
him
die
;
<EOS>
and
,
if
we
have
,
he
would
have
die
indeed
in
a
few
day
more
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
find
the
man
have
some
respect
show
him
,
it
presently
occur
to
my
thought
that
we
may
bring
him
to
be
useful
to
us
,
and
perhaps
make
him
a
kind
of
commander
over
them
.
<EOS>
so
I
cause
our
surgeon
to
take
him
in
hand
,
and
give
the
poor
wretch
good
word
,
that
be
to
say
,
I
speak
to
him
as
well
as
I
could
by
sign
,
to
make
him
understand
that
we
would
make
him
well
again
.
  
<EOS>
this
create
a
new
awe
in
their
mind
of
us
,
believe
that
,
as
we
could
kill
at
a
distance
by
something
invisible
to
them
(
for
so
our
shot
be
,
to
be
sure
)
<EOS>
,
so
we
could
make
them
well
again
too
.
<EOS>
upon
this
the
young
prince
(
for
so
we
call
him
afterwards
)
call
six
or
seven
of
the
savage
to
him
,
and
say
something
to
them
;
what
it
be
we
know
not
,
but
immediately
all
the
seven
come
to
me
,
and
kneel
down
to
me
,
hold
up
their
hand
,
and
make
sign
of
entreaty
,
point
to
the
place
where
one
of
those
lay
whom
we
have
kill
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
time
before
I
or
any
of
us
could
understand
them
;
but
one
of
them
run
and
lift
up
a
dead
man
,
point
to
his
wound
,
which
be
in
his
eye
,
for
he
be
shoot
into
the
head
at
one
of
his
eye
.
<EOS>
then
another
point
to
the
surgeon
,
and
at
last
we
find
it
out
,
that
the
meaning
be
,
that
he
should
heal
the
prince
's
father
too
,
who
be
dead
,
be
shoot
through
the
head
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
We
presently
take
the
hint
,
and
would
not
say
we
could
not
do
it
,
but
let
them
know
,
the
man
that
be
kill
be
those
that
have
first
fall
upon
us
,
and
provoke
us
,
and
we
would
by
no
mean
make
them
alive
again
;
and
that
,
if
any
other
do
so
,
we
would
kill
them
too
,
and
never
let
them
live
any
more
:
but
that
,
if
he
(
the
prince
)
would
be
willing
to
go
with
us
,
and
do
as
we
should
direct
him
,
we
would
not
let
him
die
,
and
would
make
his
arm
well
.
<EOS>
upon
this
he
bid
his
man
go
and
fetch
a
long
stick
or
staff
,
and
lie
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
when
they
bring
it
,
we
see
it
be
an
arrow
;
he
take
it
with
his
left
hand
(
for
his
other
be
lame
with
the
wound
)
,
and
,
point
up
at
the
sun
,
break
the
arrow
in
two
,
and
set
the
point
against
his
breast
,
and
then
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
as
I
understand
afterwards
,
wish
the
sun
,
whom
they
worship
,
may
shoot
him
into
the
breast
with
an
arrow
,
if
ever
he
fail
to
be
my
friend
;
and
give
the
point
of
the
arrow
to
me
be
to
be
a
testimony
that
I
be
the
man
he
have
swear
to
:
and
never
be
Christian
more
punctual
to
an
oath
than
he
be
to
this
,
for
he
be
a
swear
servant
to
us
for
many
a
weary
month
after
that
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
bring
him
to
the
surgeon
,
he
immediately
dress
the
wound
in
his
haunch
or
buttock
,
and
find
the
bullet
have
only
graze
upon
the
flesh
,
and
pass
,
as
it
be
,
by
it
,
but
it
be
not
lodge
in
the
part
,
so
that
it
be
soon
heal
and
well
again
;
but
<EOS>
,
as
to
his
arm
,
he
find
one
of
the
bone
break
,
which
be
in
the
fore
-
part
from
the
wrist
to
the
elbow
;
and
this
he
set
,
and
splinter
it
up
,
and
bind
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
hang
it
about
his
neck
,
and
make
sign
to
him
that
he
should
not
stir
it
;
which
he
be
so
strict
<EOS>
an
observer
of
,
that
he
set
him
down
,
and
never
move
one
way
or
other
but
as
the
surgeon
give
him
leave
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
great
deal
of
pain
to
acquaint
this
negro
what
we
intend
to
do
,
and
what
use
we
intend
to
make
of
his
man
;
and
particularly
to
teach
him
the
meaning
of
what
we
say
,
especially
to
teach
him
some
word
,
such
as
yes
and
no
,
and
what
they
mean
,
and
to
inure
him
to
our
way
of
talk
;
and
he
be
very
willing
and
apt
to
learn
anything
I
teach
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
let
him
see
that
we
intend
to
carry
our
provision
with
us
from
the
first
day
;
but
he
make
sign
to
us
to
tell
us
we
need
not
,
for
we
should
find
provision
enough
everywhere
for
forty
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
difficult
for
us
to
understand
how
he
express
forty
;
for
he
know
no
figure
,
but
some
word
that
they
use
to
one
another
that
they
understand
it
by
.
<EOS>
at
last
one
of
the
negro
,
by
his
order
,
lay
forty
little
stone
one
by
another
,
to
show
us
how
many
day
we
should
travel
,
and
find
provision
sufficient
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
show
him
our
baggage
,
which
be
very
heavy
,
particularly
our
powder
,
shot
,
lead
,
iron
,
carpenter
'
tool
,
seaman
's
instrument
,
case
of
bottle
,
and
other
lumber
.
<EOS>
He
take
some
of
the
thing
up
in
his
hand
to
feel
the
weight
,
and
shake
his
head
at
them
;
so
I
tell
our
people
they
must
resolve
to
divide
their
thing
into
small
parcel
,
and
make
them
portable
;
and
accordingly
they
do
so
,
by
which
mean
we
be
fain
to
leave
all
our
chest
behind
us
,
which
be
eleven
in
number
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
make
sign
to
us
that
he
would
procure
some
buffalo
,
or
young
bull
,
as
I
call
them
,
to
carry
thing
for
us
,
and
make
sign
,
too
,
that
if
we
be
weary
,
we
may
be
carry
too
;
but
that
we
slight
,
only
be
willing
to
have
the
creature
,
because
,
at
last
,
when
they
could
serve
us
no
farther
for
carriage
,
we
may
eat
them
all
up
if
we
have
any
occasion
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
carry
him
to
our
bark
,
and
show
him
what
thing
we
have
here
.
<EOS>
He
seem
amazed
at
the
sight
of
our
bark
,
have
never
see
anything
of
that
kind
before
,
for
their
boat
be
most
wretched
thing
,
such
as
I
never
see
before
,
have
no
head
or
stern
,
and
be
make
only
of
the
skin
of
goat
,
sew
together
with
dry
gut
of
goat
and
sheep
,
and
do
over
with
a
kind
of
slimy
stuff
like
rosin
and
oil
,
but
of
a
most
nauseous
,
odious
smell
;
and
they
be
poor
miserable
thing
for
boat
,
the
bad
that
any
part
of
the
world
ever
see
;
a
canoe
be
an
excellent
contrivance
compare
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
our
boat
.
<EOS>
We
carry
our
new
prince
into
it
,
and
help
him
over
the
side
,
because
of
his
lameness
.
<EOS>
We
make
sign
to
him
that
his
man
must
carry
our
good
for
us
,
and
show
him
what
we
have
;
he
answer
,
"
Si
,
Seignior
,
"
or
,
"
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
"
<EOS>
(
for
we
have
teach
him
that
word
and
the
meaning
of
it
)
,
and
take
up
a
bundle
,
he
make
sign
to
us
,
that
when
his
arm
be
well
he
would
carry
some
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
sign
again
to
tell
him
,
that
if
he
would
make
his
man
carry
them
,
we
would
not
let
him
carry
anything
.
<EOS>
We
have
secure
all
the
prisoner
in
a
narrow
place
,
where
we
have
bind
them
with
mat
cord
,
and
set
up
stake
like
a
palisado
round
them
;
so
,
when
we
carry
the
prince
on
shore
,
we
go
with
him
to
them
,
and
make
sign
to
him
to
ask
them
if
they
be
willing
to
go
with
us
to
the
country
of
lion
.
<EOS>
accordingly
he
make
a
long
speech
to
them
,
and
we
could
understand
by
it
that
he
tell
them
,
if
they
be
willing
,
they
must
say
,
"
Si
,
Seignior
,
"
tell
them
what
it
signify
.
<EOS>
They
immediately
answer
,
"
Si
,
Seignior
,
"
and
clap
their
hand
,
look
up
to
the
sun
,
which
,
the
prince
signify
to
us
,
be
swear
to
be
faithful
.
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
they
have
say
so
,
one
of
them
make
a
long
speech
to
the
prince
;
and
in
it
we
perceive
,
by
his
gesture
,
which
be
very
antic
,
that
they
desire
something
from
us
,
and
that
they
be
in
great
concern
about
it
.
<EOS>
so
I
ask
him
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
what
it
be
they
desire
of
us
;
he
tell
us
by
sign
that
they
desire
we
should
clap
our
hand
to
the
sun
(
that
be
,
to
swear
)
that
we
would
not
kill
them
,
that
we
would
give
them
chiaruck
,
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
bread
,
would
not
starve
them
,
and
would
not
let
the
lion
eat
them
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
we
would
promise
all
that
;
then
he
point
to
the
sun
,
and
clap
his
hand
,
sign
to
me
that
I
should
do
so
too
,
which
I
do
;
at
which
all
the
prisoner
fall
flat
on
the
ground
,
and
rise
up
again
,
make
the
odd
,
wildest
cry
that
ever
I
hear
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
ever
any
religious
thought
affect
me
;
but
I
could
not
refrain
some
reflection
,
and
almost
tear
,
in
consider
how
happy
it
be
that
I
be
not
bear
among
such
creature
as
these
,
and
be
not
so
stupidly
ignorant
and
barbarous
;
but
this
soon
go
off
again
,
and
I
be
not
trouble
again
with
any
qualm
of
that
sort
for
a
long
time
after
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
ceremony
be
over
,
our
concern
be
to
get
some
provision
,
as
well
for
the
present
subsistence
of
our
prisoner
as
ourselves
;
and
make
sign
to
our
prince
that
we
be
think
upon
that
subject
,
he
make
sign
to
me
that
,
if
I
would
let
one
of
the
prisoner
go
to
his
town
,
he
should
bring
provision
,
and
should
bring
some
beast
to
carry
our
baggage
.
<EOS>
I
seem
loth
to
trust
him
,
and
suppose
that
he
would
run
away
,
he
make
great
sign
of
fidelity
,
and
with
his
own
hand
tie
a
rope
about
his
neck
,
offer
me
one
end
of
it
,
intimate
that
I
should
hang
him
if
the
man
do
not
come
again
.
<EOS>
so
I
consent
,
and
he
give
him
abundance
of
instruction
,
and
send
him
away
,
point
to
the
light
of
the
sun
,
which
it
seem
be
to
tell
him
at
what
time
he
must
be
back
.
  
<EOS>
the
fellow
run
as
if
he
be
mad
,
and
hold
it
till
he
be
quite
out
of
sight
,
by
which
I
suppose
he
have
a
great
way
to
go
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
about
two
hour
before
the
time
appoint
,
the
black
prince
,
for
so
I
always
call
him
,
beckon
with
his
hand
to
me
,
and
halloo
after
his
manner
,
desire
me
to
come
to
him
,
<EOS>
which
I
do
,
when
,
point
to
a
little
hill
about
two
mile
off
,
I
see
plainly
a
little
drove
of
cattle
,
and
several
people
with
them
;
those
,
he
tell
me
by
sign
,
be
the
man
he
have
send
,
and
several
more
with
him
,
and
cattle
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
by
the
time
appoint
,
he
come
quite
to
our
hut
,
and
bring
with
him
a
great
many
cow
,
young
runt
,
about
sixteen
goat
,
and
four
young
bull
,
teach
to
carry
burthen
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
supply
of
provision
sufficient
;
as
for
bread
,
we
be
oblige
to
shift
with
some
root
which
we
have
make
use
of
before
.
<EOS>
We
then
begin
to
consider
of
make
some
large
bag
like
the
soldier
'
knapsack
,
for
their
man
to
carry
our
baggage
in
,
and
to
make
it
easy
to
them
;
and
the
goat
be
kill
,
I
order
the
skin
to
be
spread
in
the
sun
,
and
they
be
as
dry
in
two
day
as
could
be
desire
;
so
we
find
mean
to
make
such
little
bag
as
we
want
,
and
begin
to
divide
our
baggage
into
them
.
<EOS>
when
the
black
prince
find
what
they
be
for
,
and
how
easy
they
be
of
carriage
when
we
put
them
on
,
he
smile
a
little
,
and
send
away
the
man
again
to
fetch
skin
,
and
he
bring
two
native
more
with
him
,
all
load
with
skin
better
cure
than
ours
,
and
of
other
kind
,
such
as
we
could
not
tell
what
name
to
give
them
.
  
<EOS>
these
two
man
bring
the
black
prince
two
lance
,
of
the
sort
they
use
in
their
fight
,
but
fine
than
ordinary
,
be
make
of
black
smooth
wood
,
as
fine
as
ebony
,
and
head
at
the
point
with
the
end
of
a
long
tooth
of
some
creature
 
<EOS>
we
could
not
tell
of
what
creature
;
the
head
be
so
firm
put
on
,
and
the
tooth
so
strong
,
though
no
big
than
my
thumb
,
and
sharp
at
the
end
,
that
I
never
see
anything
like
it
in
any
place
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
the
prince
would
not
take
them
till
I
give
him
leave
,
but
make
sign
that
they
should
give
them
to
me
;
however
,
I
give
him
leave
to
take
them
himself
,
<EOS>
for
I
see
evident
sign
of
an
honourable
just
principle
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
now
prepare
for
our
march
,
when
the
prince
come
to
me
,
and
point
towards
the
several
quarter
of
the
world
,
make
sign
to
know
which
way
we
intend
to
go
;
and
when
I
show
him
,
point
to
the
west
,
he
presently
let
me
know
there
be
a
great
river
a
little
further
to
the
north
,
which
be
able
to
carry
our
bark
many
league
into
the
country
due
west
.
<EOS>
I
presently
take
the
hint
,
and
inquire
for
the
mouth
of
the
river
,
which
I
understand
by
him
be
above
a
day
's
march
,
and
,
by
our
estimation
,
we
find
it
about
seven
league
further
.
<EOS>
I
take
this
to
be
the
great
river
mark
by
our
chart
-
maker
at
the
northmost
part
of
the
coast
of
Mozambique
,
and
call
there
Quilloa
.
  
<EOS>
consult
thus
with
ourselves
,
we
resolve
to
take
the
prince
,
and
as
many
of
the
prisoner
as
we
could
stow
in
our
frigate
,
and
go
about
by
the
bay
into
the
river
;
and
that
eight
of
us
,
with
our
arm
,
should
march
by
land
to
meet
them
on
the
river
side
;
for
the
prince
,
carry
us
to
a
rise
ground
,
have
show
us
the
river
very
plain
,
a
great
way
up
the
country
,
and
in
one
place
it
be
not
above
six
mile
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
lot
to
march
by
land
,
and
be
captain
of
the
whole
caravan
.
<EOS>
I
have
eight
of
our
man
with
me
,
and
seven
-
and
-
thirty
of
our
prisoner
,
without
any
baggage
,
for
all
our
luggage
be
yet
on
board
.
<EOS>
We
drive
the
young
bull
with
us
;
nothing
be
ever
so
tame
,
so
willing
to
work
,
or
carry
anything
.
<EOS>
the
negro
would
ride
upon
them
four
at
a
time
,
and
they
would
go
very
willingly
.
<EOS>
They
would
eat
out
of
our
hand
,
lick
our
foot
,
and
be
as
tractable
as
a
dog
.
  
<EOS>
We
drive
with
us
six
or
seven
cow
for
food
;
but
our
negro
know
nothing
of
cure
the
flesh
by
salt
and
dry
it
till
we
show
them
the
way
,
and
then
they
be
mighty
willing
to
do
so
as
long
as
we
have
any
salt
to
do
it
with
,
and
to
carry
salt
a
great
way
too
,
after
we
find
we
should
have
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
easy
march
to
the
river
side
for
us
that
go
by
land
,
and
we
come
thither
in
a
piece
of
a
day
,
be
,
as
above
,
no
more
than
six
english
mile
;
whereas
it
be
no
less
than
five
day
before
they
come
to
us
by
water
,
the
wind
in
the
bay
have
fail
them
,
and
the
way
,
by
reason
of
a
great
turn
or
reach
in
the
river
,
be
about
fifty
mile
about
.
  
<EOS>
We
spend
this
time
in
a
thing
which
the
two
stranger
,
which
bring
the
prince
the
two
lance
,
put
into
the
head
of
the
prisoner
,
viz
.
,
to
make
bottle
of
the
goat
'
skin
to
carry
fresh
water
in
,
which
it
seem
they
know
we
should
come
to
want
;
and
the
man
do
it
so
dexterously
,
have
dry
skin
fetch
them
by
those
two
man
,
that
before
our
vessel
come
up
,
they
have
every
man
a
pouch
like
a
bladder
,
to
carry
fresh
water
in
,
hang
over
their
shoulder
by
a
thong
make
of
other
skin
,
about
three
inch
broad
,
like
the
sling
of
a
fuzee
.
  
<EOS>
Our
prince
,
to
assure
us
of
the
fidelity
of
the
man
in
this
march
,
have
order
them
to
be
tie
two
and
two
by
the
wrist
,
as
we
handcuff
prisoner
in
England
;
and
make
them
so
sensible
of
the
reasonableness
of
it
,
that
he
make
them
do
it
themselves
,
appoint
four
of
them
to
bind
the
rest
;
but
we
find
them
so
honest
,
and
particularly
so
obedient
to
him
,
that
after
we
be
get
a
little
further
off
of
their
own
country
,
we
set
them
at
liberty
,
though
,
when
he
come
to
us
,
he
would
have
them
tie
again
,
and
they
continue
so
a
good
while
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
country
on
the
bank
of
the
river
be
a
high
land
,
no
marshy
swampy
ground
in
it
;
<EOS>
the
verdure
good
,
and
abundance
of
cattle
feed
upon
it
wherever
we
go
,
or
which
way
soever
we
look
;
there
be
not
much
wood
indeed
,
at
least
not
near
us
;
but
further
up
we
see
oak
,
cedar
,
and
pine
-
tree
,
some
of
which
be
very
large
.
  
<EOS>
the
river
be
a
fair
open
channel
,
about
as
broad
as
the
Thames
below
Gravesend
,
and
a
strong
tide
of
flood
,
which
we
find
hold
us
about
sixty
mile
;
the
channel
deep
,
nor
do
we
find
any
want
of
water
for
a
great
way
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
go
merrily
up
the
river
with
the
flood
and
the
wind
blow
still
fresh
at
E.
and
E.N.E.
<EOS>
We
stem
the
ebb
easily
also
,
especially
while
the
river
continue
broad
and
deep
;
but
when
we
come
past
the
swelling
of
the
tide
,
and
have
the
natural
current
of
the
river
to
go
against
,
we
find
it
too
strong
for
us
,
and
begin
to
think
of
quit
our
bark
;
but
the
prince
would
by
no
mean
agree
to
that
,
for
,
find
we
have
on
board
pretty
good
store
of
rope
make
of
mat
and
flag
,
which
I
describe
before
,
he
order
all
the
prisoner
which
be
on
shore
to
come
and
take
hold
of
those
rope
,
and
tow
us
along
by
the
shore
side
;
and
as
we
hoist
our
sail
too
,
to
ease
them
,
the
man
run
along
with
us
at
a
very
great
rate
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
the
river
carry
us
up
,
by
our
computation
,
near
200
mile
,
and
then
it
narrow
apace
,
and
be
not
above
as
broad
as
the
Thames
be
at
Windsor
,
or
thereabout
;
and
,
after
another
day
,
we
come
to
a
great
waterfall
or
cataract
,
enough
to
fright
us
,
for
I
believe
the
whole
body
of
water
fall
at
once
perpendicularly
down
a
precipice
above
<EOS>
sixty
foot
high
,
which
make
noise
enough
to
deprive
man
of
their
hearing
,
and
we
hear
it
above
ten
mile
before
we
come
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
be
at
a
full
stop
,
and
now
our
prisoner
go
first
on
shore
;
they
have
work
very
hard
and
very
cheerfully
,
relieve
one
another
,
those
that
be
weary
be
take
into
the
bark
.
<EOS>
have
we
have
canoe
or
any
boat
which
may
have
be
carry
by
man
's
strength
we
may
have
go
two
hundred
mile
more
up
this
river
in
small
boat
,
but
our
great
boat
could
go
no
farther
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
way
the
country
look
green
and
pleasant
,
and
be
full
of
cattle
,
and
some
people
we
see
,
though
not
many
;
but
this
we
observe
now
,
that
the
people
do
no
more
understand
our
prisoner
here
than
we
could
understand
them
;
be
,
it
seem
,
of
different
nation
and
of
different
speech
.
<EOS>
We
have
yet
see
no
wild
beast
,
or
,
at
least
,
none
that
come
very
near
us
,
except
two
day
before
we
come
to
the
waterfall
,
when
we
see
three
of
the
most
beautiful
leopard
that
ever
be
see
,
stand
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
on
the
north
side
,
our
prisoner
be
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
Our
gunner
espy
them
first
,
and
run
to
fetch
his
gun
,
put
a
ball
extraordinary
in
it
;
and
come
to
me
,
"
<EOS>
now
,
Captain
Bob
,
"
say
he
,
"
where
be
your
prince
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
call
him
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
say
he
,
"
tell
your
man
not
to
be
afraid
;
tell
them
they
shall
see
that
thing
in
his
hand
speak
in
fire
to
one
of
those
beast
,
and
make
it
kill
itself
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
poor
negro
look
as
if
they
have
be
all
go
to
be
kill
,
notwithstanding
what
their
prince
say
to
them
,
and
stand
stare
to
expect
the
issue
,
when
on
a
sudden
the
gunner
fire
;
and
as
he
be
a
very
good
marksman
,
he
shoot
the
creature
with
two
slug
,
just
in
the
head
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
leopard
feel
herself
strike
,
she
rear
up
on
her
two
hind
-
leg
,
bolt
upright
,
and
throw
her
forepaw
about
in
the
air
,
fall
backward
,
growl
and
struggle
,
and
immediately
die
;
<EOS>
the
other
two
,
fright
with
the
fire
and
the
noise
,
flee
,
and
be
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
two
fright
leopard
be
not
in
half
the
consternation
that
our
prisoner
be
;
four
or
five
of
them
fall
down
as
if
they
have
be
shoot
;
several
other
fall
on
their
knee
,
and
lift
up
their
hand
to
us
;
whether
to
worship
us
,
or
pray
us
not
to
kill
them
,
we
do
not
know
;
but
we
make
sign
to
their
prince
to
encourage
them
,
which
he
do
,
but
it
be
with
much
ado
that
he
bring
them
to
their
sense
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
prince
,
notwithstanding
all
that
be
say
to
prepare
him
for
it
,
yet
when
the
piece
go
off
,
he
give
a
start
as
if
he
would
have
leap
into
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
see
the
creature
kill
,
I
have
a
great
mind
to
have
the
skin
of
her
,
and
make
sign
to
the
prince
that
he
should
send
some
of
his
man
over
to
take
the
skin
off
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
speak
but
a
word
,
four
of
them
,
that
offer
themselves
,
be
untie
,
and
immediately
they
jump
into
the
river
,
and
swam
over
,
and
go
to
work
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
prince
have
a
knife
that
we
give
him
,
make
four
wooden
knife
so
clever
,
that
I
never
see
anything
like
them
in
my
life
;
and
in
less
than
an
hour
's
time
they
bring
me
the
skin
of
the
leopard
,
which
be
a
monstrous
great
one
,
for
it
be
from
the
ear
to
the
tale
about
seven
foot
,
and
near
five
foot
broad
on
the
back
,
and
most
admirably
spot
all
over
.
<EOS>
the
skin
of
this
leopard
I
bring
to
London
many
year
after
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
all
upon
a
level
as
to
our
travelling
,
be
unshipped
,
for
our
bark
would
swim
no
farther
,
and
she
be
too
heavy
to
carry
on
our
back
;
but
as
we
find
the
course
of
the
river
go
a
great
way
<EOS>
farther
,
we
consult
our
carpenter
whether
we
could
not
pull
the
bark
in
piece
,
and
make
us
three
or
four
small
boat
to
go
on
with
.
<EOS>
They
tell
us
we
may
do
so
,
but
it
would
be
very
long
a
-
doing
;
and
that
,
when
we
have
do
,
we
have
neither
pitch
or
tar
to
make
them
sound
to
keep
the
water
out
,
or
nail
to
fasten
the
plank
.
<EOS>
but
one
of
them
tell
us
that
as
soon
as
he
could
come
at
any
large
tree
near
the
river
,
he
would
make
us
a
canoe
or
two
in
a
quarter
of
the
time
,
and
which
would
serve
us
as
well
for
all
the
use
we
could
have
any
occasion
for
as
a
boat
;
and
such
,
that
if
we
come
to
any
waterfall
,
we
may
take
them
up
,
and
carry
them
for
a
mile
or
two
by
land
upon
our
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
we
give
over
the
thought
of
our
frigate
,
and
haul
her
into
a
little
cove
or
inlet
,
where
a
small
brook
come
into
the
main
river
,
we
lay
her
up
for
those
that
come
next
,
and
march
forward
.
<EOS>
We
spend
indeed
two
day
divide
our
baggage
,
and
load
our
tame
buffalo
and
our
negro
.
<EOS>
Our
powder
and
shot
,
which
be
the
thing
we
be
most
careful
of
,
we
order
thus
:
 
first
,
the
powder
we
divide
into
little
leather
bag
,
that
be
to
say
,
bag
of
dry
skin
,
with
the
hair
inward
,
that
the
powder
may
not
grow
damp
;
and
then
we
put
those
bag
into
other
bag
,
make
of
bullock
'
skin
,
very
thick
and
hard
,
with
the
hair
outward
,
that
no
wet
may
come
in
;
and
this
succeed
so
well
,
that
in
the
great
rain
we
have
,
whereof
some
be
very
violent
and
very
long
<EOS>
,
we
always
keep
our
powder
dry
.
<EOS>
besides
these
bag
,
which
hold
our
chief
magazine
,
we
divide
to
every
one
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
powder
,
and
half
a
pound
of
shot
,
to
carry
always
about
us
;
which
,
as
it
be
enough
for
our
present
use
,
so
we
be
willing
to
have
no
weight
to
carry
more
than
be
absolutely
necessary
,
because
of
the
heat
.
  
<EOS>
We
keep
still
on
the
bank
of
the
river
,
and
for
that
reason
have
but
very
little
communication
with
the
people
of
the
country
;
for
,
have
also
our
bark
store
with
plenty
of
provision
,
we
have
no
occasion
to
look
abroad
for
a
supply
;
but
now
,
when
we
come
to
march
on
foot
,
we
be
oblige
often
to
seek
out
for
food
.
<EOS>
the
first
place
we
come
to
on
the
river
,
that
give
us
any
stop
,
be
a
little
negro
town
,
contain
about
fifty
hut
,
and
there
appear
about
400
people
,
for
they
all
come
out
to
see
us
,
and
wonder
at
us
.
<EOS>
when
our
negro
appear
the
inhabitant
begin
to
fly
to
arm
,
think
there
have
be
enemy
come
upon
them
;
but
our
negro
,
though
they
could
not
speak
their
language
,
make
sign
to
them
that
they
have
no
weapon
,
and
be
tie
two
and
two
together
as
captive
,
and
that
there
be
people
behind
who
come
from
the
sun
,
and
that
could
kill
them
all
,
and
make
them
alive
again
,
if
they
please
;
but
that
they
would
do
them
no
hurt
,
and
come
with
peace
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
understand
this
they
lay
down
their
lance
,
and
bow
and
arrow
,
and
come
and
stick
twelve
large
stake
in
the
ground
as
a
token
of
peace
,
bow
themselves
to
us
in
token
of
submission
.
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
they
see
white
man
with
beard
,
that
be
to
say
,
with
mustachio
,
they
run
scream
away
,
as
in
a
fright
.
  
<EOS>
We
keep
at
a
distance
from
them
,
not
to
be
too
familiar
;
and
when
we
do
appear
it
be
but
two
or
three
of
us
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
but
our
prisoner
make
them
understand
that
we
require
some
provision
of
them
;
so
they
bring
us
some
black
cattle
,
for
they
have
abundance
of
cow
and
buffalo
all
over
that
side
of
the
country
,
as
also
great
number
of
deer
.
<EOS>
Our
cutler
,
who
have
now
a
great
stock
of
thing
of
his
handiwork
,
give
them
some
little
knick
-
knack
,
as
plate
of
silver
and
of
iron
,
cut
diamond
fashion
,
and
cut
into
heart
and
into
ring
,
and
they
be
mightily
pleased
.
<EOS>
They
also
bring
several
fruit
and
root
,
which
we
do
not
understand
,
but
our
negro
feed
heartily
on
them
,
and
after
we
have
see
them
eat
them
,
we
do
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
have
stock
ourselves
here
with
flesh
and
root
as
much
as
we
could
well
carry
,
we
divide
the
burthen
among
our
negro
,
appoint
about
thirty
to
forty
pound
weight
to
a
man
,
which
we
think
indeed
be
load
enough
in
a
hot
country
;
and
the
negro
do
not
at
all
repine
at
it
,
but
would
sometimes
help
one
another
when
they
begin
to
be
weary
,
which
do
happen
now
and
then
,
though
not
often
;
besides
,
as
most
of
their
luggage
be
our
provision
,
it
lighten
every
day
,
like
Aesop
's
basket
of
bread
,
till
we
come
to
get
a
recruit
.
 
<EOS>
Note
,
when
we
load
them
we
untie
their
hand
,
and
tie
them
two
and
two
together
by
one
foot
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
day
of
our
march
from
this
place
our
chief
carpenter
desire
us
to
halt
,
and
set
up
some
hut
,
for
he
have
find
out
some
tree
that
he
like
,
and
resolve
to
make
us
some
canoe
;
for
,
as
he
tell
me
,
he
know
we
should
have
march
enough
on
foot
after
we
leave
the
river
,
and
he
be
resolve
to
go
no
farther
by
land
than
need
must
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
no
sooner
give
order
for
our
little
camp
,
and
give
leave
to
our
negro
to
lay
down
their
load
,
but
they
fall
to
work
to
build
our
hut
;
and
though
they
be
tie
as
above
,
yet
they
do
it
so
nimbly
as
surprise
us
.
<EOS>
here
we
set
some
of
the
negro
quite
at
liberty
,
that
be
to
say
,
without
tie
them
,
have
the
prince
's
word
pass
for
their
fidelity
;
and
some
of
these
be
order
to
help
the
carpenter
,
which
they
do
very
handily
,
with
a
little
direction
,
and
other
be
send
to
see
whether
they
could
get
any
provision
near
hand
;
but
instead
of
provision
,
three
of
them
come
in
with
two
bow
and
arrow
,
and
five
lance
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
easily
make
us
understand
how
they
come
by
them
,
only
that
they
have
surprise
some
negro
woman
,
who
be
in
some
hut
,
the
man
be
from
home
,
and
they
have
find
the
lance
and
bow
in
the
hut
,
or
house
,
the
woman
and
child
fly
away
at
the
sight
of
them
,
as
from
robber
.
<EOS>
We
seem
very
angry
at
them
,
and
make
the
prince
ask
them
if
they
have
not
kill
any
of
the
woman
or
child
,
make
them
believe
that
,
if
they
have
kill
anybody
,
we
would
make
them
kill
themselves
too
;
but
they
protest
their
innocence
,
so
we
excuse
them
.
<EOS>
then
they
bring
us
the
bow
and
arrow
and
lance
;
but
,
at
a
motion
of
their
black
prince
,
we
give
them
back
the
bow
and
arrow
,
and
give
them
leave
to
go
out
to
see
what
they
could
kill
for
food
;
and
here
we
give
them
the
law
of
arm
,
viz
.
,
that
if
any
man
appear
to
assault
them
,
or
shoot
at
them
to
offer
any
violence
to
them
,
they
may
kill
them
;
but
that
they
should
not
offer
to
kill
or
hurt
any
that
offer
them
peace
,
or
lay
down
their
weapon
,
nor
any
woman
or
child
,
upon
any
occasion
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
these
be
our
article
of
war
.
  
<EOS>
these
two
fellow
have
not
be
go
out
above
three
or
four
hour
,
but
one
of
them
come
run
to
us
without
his
bow
and
arrow
,
halloo
and
whoop
a
great
while
before
he
come
at
us
,
"
Okoamo
,
okoamo
!
"
<EOS>
which
,
it
seem
,
be
,
"
help
,
help
!
"
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
negro
rise
up
in
a
hurry
,
and
by
two
,
as
they
could
,
run
forward
towards
their
fellow
,
to
know
what
the
matter
be
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
do
not
understand
it
,
nor
any
of
our
people
;
the
prince
look
as
if
something
unlucky
have
fall
out
,
and
some
of
our
man
take
up
their
arm
to
be
ready
on
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
the
negro
soon
discover
the
thing
,
for
we
see
four
of
them
presently
after
come
along
with
a
great
load
of
meat
upon
their
back
.
<EOS>
the
case
be
,
that
the
two
who
go
out
with
their
bow
and
arrow
,
meet
with
a
great
herd
of
deer
in
the
plain
,
have
be
so
nimble
as
to
shoot
three
of
them
,
and
then
one
of
them
come
run
to
us
for
help
to
fetch
them
away
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
venison
we
have
meet
with
in
all
our
march
,
and
we
feast
upon
it
very
plentifully
;
and
this
be
the
first
time
we
begin
to
prevail
with
our
prince
to
eat
his
meat
dress
our
way
;
after
which
his
man
be
prevail
with
by
his
example
,
but
before
that
,
they
eat
most
of
the
flesh
<EOS>
they
have
quite
raw
.
  
<EOS>
We
wish
now
we
have
bring
some
bow
and
arrow
out
with
us
,
which
we
may
have
do
;
and
we
begin
to
have
so
much
confidence
in
our
negro
,
and
to
be
so
familiar
with
them
,
that
we
oftentime
let
them
go
,
or
the
great
part
of
them
,
untie
,
be
well
assured
they
would
not
leave
us
,
and
that
they
do
not
know
what
course
to
take
without
us
;
but
one
thing
we
resolve
not
to
trust
them
with
,
and
that
be
the
charge
our
gun
:
but
they
always
believe
our
gun
have
some
heavenly
power
in
them
,
that
would
send
forth
fire
and
smoke
,
and
speak
with
a
dreadful
noise
,
and
kill
at
a
distance
whenever
we
bid
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
eight
day
we
finish
three
canoe
,
and
in
them
we
embark
our
white
man
and
our
baggage
,
with
our
prince
,
and
some
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
We
also
find
it
needful
to
keep
some
of
ourselves
always
on
shore
,
not
only
to
manage
the
negro
,
but
to
defend
them
from
enemy
and
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
abundance
of
little
incident
happen
upon
this
march
,
which
it
be
impossible
to
crowd
into
this
account
;
particularly
,
we
see
more
wild
beast
now
than
we
do
before
,
some
elephant
,
and
two
or
three
lion
,
none
of
which
kind
we
have
see
any
of
before
;
and
we
find
our
negro
be
more
afraid
of
them
<EOS>
a
great
deal
than
we
be
;
principally
,
because
they
have
no
bow
and
arrow
,
or
lance
,
which
be
the
particular
weapon
they
be
breed
up
to
the
exercise
of
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
cure
them
of
their
fear
by
be
always
ready
with
our
firearm
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
we
be
willing
to
be
spare
of
our
powder
,
and
the
killing
of
any
of
the
creature
now
be
no
advantage
to
us
,
see
their
skin
be
too
heavy
for
us
to
carry
,
and
their
flesh
not
good
to
eat
,
we
resolve
therefore
to
keep
some
of
our
piece
uncharged
and
only
prime
;
and
cause
them
to
flash
in
the
pan
,
the
beast
,
even
the
lion
themselves
,
would
always
start
and
fly
back
when
they
see
it
,
and
immediately
march
off
.
  
<EOS>
We
pass
abundance
of
inhabitant
upon
this
upper
part
of
the
river
,
and
with
this
observation
,
that
almost
every
ten
mile
we
come
to
a
separate
nation
,
and
every
separate
nation
have
a
different
speech
,
or
else
their
speech
have
differ
dialect
,
so
that
they
do
not
understand
one
another
.
<EOS>
They
all
abound
in
cattle
,
especially
on
the
river
-
side
;
and
the
eighth
day
of
this
second
navigation
we
meet
with
a
little
negro
town
,
where
they
have
grow
a
sort
of
corn
like
rice
,
which
eat
very
sweet
;
and
,
as
we
get
some
of
it
of
the
people
,
we
make
very
good
cake
of
bread
of
it
,
and
,
make
a
fire
,
bake
them
on
the
ground
,
after
the
fire
be
sweep
away
,
very
well
;
so
that
hitherto
<EOS>
we
have
no
want
of
provision
of
any
kind
that
we
could
desire
.
  
<EOS>
Our
negro
tow
our
canoe
,
we
travel
at
a
considerable
rate
,
and
by
our
own
account
could
not
go
less
than
twenty
or
twenty
-
five
english
mile
a
day
,
and
the
river
continue
to
be
much
of
the
same
breadth
and
very
deep
all
the
way
,
<EOS>
till
on
the
tenth
day
we
come
to
another
cataract
;
for
a
ridge
of
high
hill
cross
the
whole
channel
of
the
river
,
the
water
come
tumble
down
the
rock
from
one
stage
to
another
in
a
strange
manner
,
so
that
it
be
a
continued
link
of
cataract
from
one
to
another
,
in
the
manner
of
a
cascade
,
only
that
the
fall
be
sometimes
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
one
another
,
and
the
noise
confuse
and
frightful
.
  
<EOS>
We
think
our
voyaging
be
at
a
full
stop
now
;
but
three
of
us
,
with
a
couple
of
our
negro
,
mount
the
hill
another
way
,
to
view
the
course
of
the
river
,
we
find
a
fair
channel
again
after
about
half
a
mile
's
march
,
and
that
it
be
like
to
hold
us
a
good
way
further
.
<EOS>
so
we
set
all
hand
to
work
,
unload
our
cargo
,
and
haul
our
canoe
on
shore
,
to
see
if
we
could
carry
them
.
  
<EOS>
upon
examination
we
find
that
they
be
very
heavy
;
but
our
carpenter
,
spending
but
one
day
's
work
upon
them
,
hew
away
so
much
of
the
timber
from
their
outside
as
reduce
them
very
much
,
and
yet
they
be
as
fit
to
swim
as
before
.
<EOS>
when
this
be
do
,
ten
man
with
pole
take
up
one
of
the
canoe
and
make
nothing
to
carry
it
.
<EOS>
so
we
order
twenty
man
to
each
canoe
,
that
one
ten
may
relieve
the
other
;
and
thus
we
carry
all
our
canoe
,
and
launch
them
into
the
water
again
,
and
then
fetch
our
luggage
and
load
it
all
again
into
the
canoe
,
and
all
in
an
afternoon
;
and
the
next
morning
early
we
move
forward
again
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
tow
about
four
day
more
,
our
gunner
,
who
be
our
pilot
,
begin
to
observe
that
we
do
not
keep
our
right
course
so
exactly
as
we
ought
,
the
river
wind
away
a
little
towards
the
north
,
and
give
us
notice
of
it
accordingly
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
be
not
willing
to
lose
the
advantage
of
water
-
carriage
,
at
least
not
till
we
be
force
to
it
;
so
we
jog
on
,
and
the
river
serve
us
for
about
threescore
mile
further
;
but
then
we
find
it
grow
very
small
and
shallow
,
have
pass
the
mouth
of
several
little
brook
or
rivulet
which
come
into
it
;
and
at
length
it
become
but
a
brook
itself
.
  
<EOS>
We
tow
up
as
far
as
ever
our
boat
would
swim
,
and
we
go
two
day
the
farther
 
have
be
about
twelve
day
in
this
last
part
of
the
river
 
by
lighten
the
boat
and
take
our
luggage
out
,
which
we
make
the
negro
carry
,
be
willing
to
ease
ourselves
as
long
as
we
could
;
but
at
the
end
of
these
two
day
,
in
short
,
there
be
not
water
enough
to
swim
a
London
wherry
.
  
<EOS>
We
now
set
forward
wholly
by
land
,
and
without
any
expectation
of
more
water
-
carriage
.
<EOS>
all
our
concern
for
more
water
be
to
be
sure
to
have
a
supply
for
our
drinking
;
and
therefore
upon
every
hill
that
we
come
near
we
clamber
up
to
the
high
part
to
see
the
country
before
us
,
and
to
make
the
good
judgment
we
could
which
way
to
go
to
keep
the
low
ground
,
and
as
near
some
stream
of
water
as
we
could
.
  
<EOS>
the
country
hold
verdant
,
well
grow
with
tree
,
and
spread
with
river
and
brooks
,
and
tolerably
well
with
inhabitant
,
for
about
thirty
day
'
march
after
our
leave
the
canoe
,
during
which
time
thing
go
pretty
well
with
us
;
we
do
not
tie
ourselves
down
when
to
march
and
when
to
halt
,
but
order
those
thing
as
our
convenience
and
the
health
and
ease
of
our
people
,
as
well
our
servant
as
ourselves
,
require
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
middle
of
this
march
we
come
into
a
low
and
plain
country
,
in
which
we
perceive
a
great
number
of
inhabitant
than
in
any
other
country
we
have
go
through
;
but
that
which
be
bad
for
us
,
we
find
them
a
fierce
,
barbarous
,
treacherous
people
,
and
who
at
first
look
upon
us
as
robber
,
and
gather
themselves
in
number
to
attack
us
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
be
terrify
at
them
at
first
,
and
begin
to
discover
an
unusual
fear
,
and
even
our
black
prince
seem
in
a
great
deal
of
confusion
;
but
I
smile
at
him
,
and
show
him
some
of
our
gun
<EOS>
,
I
ask
him
if
he
think
that
which
kill
the
spot
cat
(
for
so
they
call
the
leopard
in
their
language
)
could
not
make
a
thousand
of
those
naked
creature
die
at
one
blow
?
<EOS>
then
he
laugh
,
and
say
,
yes
,
he
believe
it
would
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
tell
your
man
not
to
be
afraid
of
these
people
,
for
we
shall
soon
give
them
a
taste
of
what
we
can
do
if
they
pretend
to
meddle
with
us
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
we
consider
we
be
in
the
middle
of
a
vast
country
,
and
we
know
not
what
number
of
people
and
nation
we
may
be
surround
with
,
and
,
above
all
,
we
know
not
how
much
we
may
stand
in
need
of
the
friendship
of
these
that
we
be
now
among
,
so
that
we
order
the
negro
to
try
all
the
method
they
could
to
make
them
friend
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
the
two
man
who
have
get
bow
and
arrow
,
and
two
more
to
whom
we
give
the
prince
's
two
fine
lance
,
go
foremost
,
with
five
more
,
have
long
pole
in
their
hand
;
and
after
them
ten
of
our
man
advance
toward
the
negro
town
that
be
next
to
us
,
and
we
all
stand
ready
to
succour
them
if
there
should
be
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
pretty
near
their
house
our
negro
halloo
in
their
scream
way
,
and
call
to
them
as
loud
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
upon
their
calling
,
some
of
the
man
come
out
and
answer
,
and
immediately
after
the
whole
town
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
appear
;
our
negro
,
with
their
long
pole
,
go
forward
a
little
,
and
stick
them
all
in
the
ground
,
and
leave
them
,
which
in
their
country
be
a
signal
of
peace
,
but
the
other
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
that
.
<EOS>
then
the
two
man
with
bow
lay
down
their
bow
and
arrow
,
go
forward
unarmed
,
and
make
sign
of
peace
to
them
,
which
at
last
the
other
begin
to
understand
;
so
two
of
their
man
lay
down
their
bow
and
arrow
,
and
come
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Our
man
make
all
the
sign
of
friendship
to
them
that
they
could
think
of
,
put
their
hand
up
to
their
mouth
as
a
sign
that
they
want
provision
to
eat
;
and
the
other
pretend
to
be
pleased
and
friendly
,
and
go
back
to
their
fellow
and
talk
with
them
a
while
,
and
they
come
forward
again
,
and
make
sign
that
they
would
bring
some
provision
to
them
before
the
sun
set
;
and
so
our
man
come
back
again
very
well
satisfied
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
an
hour
before
sunset
our
man
go
to
them
again
,
just
in
the
same
posture
as
before
,
and
they
come
accord
to
their
appointment
,
and
bring
deer
's
flesh
,
root
,
and
the
same
kind
of
corn
,
like
rice
,
which
I
mention
above
;
and
our
negro
,
be
furnish
with
such
toy
as
our
cutler
have
contrive
,
give
them
some
of
them
,
which
they
seem
infinitely
pleased
with
,
and
promise
to
bring
more
provision
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
the
next
day
they
come
again
,
but
our
man
perceive
they
be
more
in
number
by
a
great
many
than
before
.
<EOS>
however
,
have
send
out
ten
man
with
firearm
to
stand
ready
,
and
our
whole
army
be
in
view
also
,
we
be
not
much
surprised
;
nor
be
the
treachery
of
the
enemy
so
cunningly
order
as
in
other
case
,
for
they
may
have
surround
our
negro
,
which
be
but
nine
,
under
a
show
of
peace
;
but
when
they
see
our
man
advance
almost
as
far
as
the
place
where
they
be
the
day
before
,
the
rogue
snatch
up
their
bow
and
arrow
and
come
run
upon
our
man
like
so
many
fury
,
at
which
our
ten
man
call
to
the
negro
to
come
back
to
them
,
which
they
do
with
speed
enough
at
the
first
word
,
and
stand
all
behind
our
man
.
<EOS>
as
they
flee
,
the
other
advanced
,
and
let
fly
near
a
hundred
of
their
arrow
at
them
,
by
which
two
of
our
negro
be
wound
,
and
one
we
think
have
be
kill
.
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
five
pole
that
our
man
have
stick
in
the
ground
,
they
stand
still
awhile
,
and
gather
about
the
pole
,
look
at
them
,
and
handle
them
,
as
wonder
what
they
mean
.
<EOS>
We
then
,
who
be
draw
up
behind
all
,
send
one
of
our
number
to
our
ten
man
to
bid
them
fire
among
them
while
they
stand
so
thick
,
and
to
put
some
small
shot
into
their
gun
besides
the
ordinary
charge
,
and
to
tell
them
that
we
would
be
up
with
them
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
they
make
ready
;
but
by
the
time
they
be
ready
to
fire
,
the
black
army
have
leave
their
wander
about
the
pole
,
and
begin
to
stir
as
if
they
would
come
on
,
though
see
more
man
stand
at
some
distance
behind
our
negro
,
they
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
us
;
but
if
they
do
not
understand
us
before
,
they
understand
us
less
afterwards
,
for
as
soon
as
ever
our
man
find
them
to
begin
to
move
forward
they
fire
among
the
thick
of
them
,
be
about
the
distance
of
120
yard
,
as
near
as
we
could
guess
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
fright
,
the
screaming
and
yelling
of
those
wretch
upon
this
first
volley
.
<EOS>
We
kill
six
of
them
,
and
wound
eleven
or
twelve
,
I
mean
as
we
know
of
;
for
,
as
they
stand
thick
,
and
the
small
shot
,
as
we
call
it
,
scatter
among
them
,
we
have
reason
to
believe
we
wound
more
that
stand
farther
off
,
for
our
small
shot
be
make
of
bit
of
lead
and
bit
of
iron
,
head
of
nail
,
and
such
thing
as
our
diligent
artificer
,
the
cutler
,
help
us
to
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
those
that
be
kill
and
wound
,
the
other
frighted
creature
be
under
the
great
amazement
in
the
world
,
to
think
what
should
hurt
them
,
for
they
could
see
nothing
but
hole
make
in
their
body
they
know
not
how
.
<EOS>
then
the
fire
and
noise
amaze
all
their
woman
and
child
,
and
fright
them
out
of
their
wit
,
so
that
they
run
stare
and
howl
about
like
mad
creature
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
all
this
do
not
make
them
fly
,
which
be
what
we
want
,
nor
do
we
find
any
of
them
die
as
it
be
with
fear
,
as
at
first
;
<EOS>
so
we
resolve
upon
a
second
volley
,
and
then
to
advance
as
we
do
before
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
our
reserved
man
advance
,
we
resolve
to
fire
only
three
man
at
a
time
,
and
move
forward
like
an
army
fire
in
platoon
;
so
,
be
all
in
a
line
<EOS>
,
we
fire
,
first
three
on
the
right
,
then
three
on
the
left
,
and
so
on
;
and
every
time
we
kill
or
wound
some
of
them
,
but
still
they
do
not
fly
,
and
yet
they
be
so
frighted
that
they
use
none
of
their
bow
and
arrow
,
or
of
their
lance
;
and
we
think
their
number
increase
upon
our
hand
,
particularly
we
think
so
by
the
noise
.
<EOS>
so
I
call
to
our
man
to
halt
,
and
bid
them
pour
in
one
whole
volley
and
then
shout
,
as
we
do
in
our
first
fight
,
and
so
run
in
upon
them
and
knock
them
down
with
our
musket
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
be
too
wise
for
that
too
,
for
as
soon
as
we
have
fire
a
whole
volley
and
shout
,
they
all
run
away
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
so
fast
that
in
a
few
moment
we
could
not
see
one
creature
of
them
except
some
that
be
wound
and
lame
,
who
lie
wallowing
and
scream
here
and
there
upon
the
ground
as
they
happen
to
fall
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
we
come
up
to
the
field
of
battle
,
where
we
find
we
have
kill
thirty
-
seven
of
them
,
among
which
be
three
woman
,
and
have
wound
about
sixty
-
four
,
among
which
be
two
woman
;
by
wound
<EOS>
I
mean
such
as
be
so
maim
as
not
to
be
able
to
go
away
,
and
those
our
negro
kill
afterwards
in
a
cowardly
manner
in
cold
blood
,
for
which
we
be
very
angry
,
and
threaten
to
make
them
go
to
them
if
they
do
so
again
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
great
spoil
to
be
get
,
for
they
be
all
stark
naked
as
they
come
into
the
world
,
man
and
woman
together
,
some
of
them
have
feather
stick
in
their
hair
,
and
other
a
kind
of
bracelet
about
their
neck
,
but
nothing
else
;
but
our
negro
get
a
booty
here
,
which
we
be
very
glad
of
,
and
this
be
the
bow
and
arrow
of
the
vanquish
,
of
which
they
find
more
than
they
know
what
to
do
with
,
belong
to
the
kill
and
wound
man
;
these
we
order
them
to
pick
up
,
and
they
be
very
useful
to
us
afterwards
.
<EOS>
after
the
fight
,
and
our
negro
have
get
bow
and
arrow
,
we
send
them
out
in
party
to
see
what
they
could
get
,
and
they
get
some
provision
;
but
,
which
be
well
than
all
the
rest
,
they
bring
us
four
more
young
bull
,
or
buffalo
,
that
have
be
bring
up
to
labour
and
to
carry
burthen
.
<EOS>
They
know
them
,
it
seem
,
by
the
burthen
they
have
carry
have
gall
their
back
,
for
they
have
no
saddle
to
cover
them
with
in
that
country
.
  
<EOS>
those
creature
not
only
ease
our
negro
,
but
give
us
an
opportunity
to
carry
more
provision
;
and
our
negro
load
them
very
hard
at
this
place
with
flesh
and
root
,
such
as
we
want
very
much
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
town
we
find
a
very
little
young
leopard
,
about
two
span
high
;
it
be
exceed
tame
,
and
purr
like
a
cat
when
we
stroke
it
with
our
hand
,
be
,
as
I
suppose
,
breed
up
among
the
negro
like
a
house
-
dog
.
<EOS>
It
be
our
black
prince
,
it
seem
,
who
,
make
his
tour
among
the
abandon
house
or
hut
,
find
this
creature
there
,
and
make
much
of
him
,
and
give
a
bit
or
two
of
flesh
to
him
,
the
creature
follow
him
like
a
dog
;
of
which
more
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
negro
that
be
kill
in
this
battle
there
be
one
who
have
a
little
thin
bit
or
plate
of
gold
,
about
as
big
as
a
sixpence
,
which
hang
by
a
little
bit
of
a
twist
gut
upon
his
forehead
,
by
which
we
suppose
he
be
a
man
of
some
eminence
among
them
;
but
that
be
not
all
,
for
this
bit
of
gold
put
us
upon
search
very
narrowly
if
there
be
not
more
of
it
to
be
have
thereabout
,
but
we
find
none
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
part
of
the
country
we
go
on
for
about
fifteen
day
,
and
then
find
ourselves
oblige
to
march
up
a
high
ridge
of
mountain
,
frightful
to
behold
,
and
the
first
of
the
kind
that
we
meet
with
;
and
have
no
guide
but
our
little
pocket
-
compass
,
we
have
no
advantage
of
information
as
to
which
be
the
good
or
the
bad
way
,
but
be
oblige
to
choose
by
what
we
see
,
and
shift
as
well
as
we
could
.
<EOS>
We
meet
with
several
nation
of
wild
and
naked
people
in
the
plain
country
before
we
come
to
those
hill
,
and
we
find
them
much
more
tractable
and
friendly
than
those
devil
we
have
be
force
to
fight
with
;
and
though
we
could
learn
little
from
these
people
,
yet
we
understand
by
the
sign
they
make
that
there
be
a
vast
desert
beyond
these
hill
,
and
,
as
our
negro
call
them
,
much
lion
,
much
spot
cat
(
so
they
call
the
leopard
)
;
and
they
sign
to
us
also
that
we
must
carry
water
with
us
.
<EOS>
at
the
last
of
these
nation
we
furnish
ourselves
with
as
much
provision
as
we
could
possibly
carry
,
not
know
what
we
have
to
suffer
,
or
what
length
we
have
to
go
;
and
,
to
make
our
way
as
familiar
to
us
as
possible
,
I
propose
that
of
the
last
inhabitant
we
could
find
we
should
make
some
prisoner
and
carry
them
with
us
for
guide
over
the
desert
,
and
to
assist
us
in
carry
provision
,
and
,
perhaps
,
in
get
it
too
.
<EOS>
the
advice
be
too
necessary
to
be
slight
;
so
find
,
by
our
dumb
sign
to
the
inhabitant
,
that
there
be
some
people
that
dwelt
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
on
the
other
side
before
we
come
to
the
desert
itself
,
we
resolve
to
furnish
ourselves
with
guide
by
fair
mean
or
foul
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
by
a
moderate
computation
,
we
conclude
ourselves
700
mile
from
the
sea
-
coast
where
we
begin
.
<EOS>
Our
black
prince
be
this
day
set
free
from
the
sle
his
arm
hang
in
,
our
surgeon
have
perfectly
restore
it
,
and
he
show
it
to
his
own
countryman
quite
well
,
which
make
them
greatly
wonder
.
<EOS>
also
our
two
negro
begin
to
recover
,
and
their
wound
to
heal
apace
,
for
our
surgeon
be
very
skilful
in
manage
their
cure
.
  
<EOS>
have
with
infinite
labour
mount
these
hill
,
and
come
to
a
view
of
the
country
beyond
them
,
it
be
indeed
enough
to
astonish
as
stout
a
heart
as
ever
be
create
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
vast
howling
wilderness
 
not
a
tree
,
a
river
,
or
a
green
thing
to
be
see
;
for
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
look
,
nothing
but
a
scald
sand
,
which
,
as
the
wind
blow
,
drive
about
in
cloud
enough
to
overwhelm
man
and
beast
.
<EOS>
nor
could
we
see
any
end
of
it
either
before
us
,
which
be
our
way
,
or
to
the
right
hand
or
leave
;
so
that
truly
our
man
begin
to
be
discourage
,
and
talk
of
go
back
again
.
<EOS>
nor
could
we
indeed
think
of
venture
over
such
a
horrid
place
as
that
before
us
,
in
which
we
see
nothing
but
present
death
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
as
much
affect
at
the
sight
as
any
of
them
;
but
,
for
all
that
,
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
go
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
we
have
march
700
mile
of
our
way
,
and
it
would
be
bad
than
death
to
think
of
go
back
again
;
and
that
,
if
they
think
the
desert
be
not
passable
,
I
think
we
should
rather
change
our
course
,
and
travel
south
till
we
come
to
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
or
north
to
the
country
that
lie
along
the
Nile
,
where
,
perhaps
,
we
may
find
some
way
or
other
over
to
the
west
sea
;
for
sure
all
Africa
be
not
a
desert
.
  
<EOS>
Our
gunner
,
who
,
as
I
say
before
,
be
our
guide
as
to
the
situation
of
place
,
tell
us
that
he
could
not
tell
what
to
say
to
go
for
the
Cape
,
for
it
be
a
monstrous
length
,
be
from
the
place
where
we
now
be
not
less
than
1500
mile
;
and
,
by
his
account
,
we
be
now
come
a
third
part
of
the
way
to
the
coast
of
Angola
,
where
we
should
meet
the
western
ocean
,
and
find
way
enough
for
our
escape
home
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
assure
us
,
and
show
us
a
map
of
it
,
that
,
if
we
go
northward
,
the
western
shore
of
Africa
go
out
into
the
sea
above
1000
mile
west
,
so
that
we
should
have
so
much
and
more
land
to
travel
afterwards
;
which
land
may
,
for
aught
we
know
,
be
as
wild
,
barren
,
and
desert
as
this
.
<EOS>
and
therefore
,
upon
the
whole
,
he
propose
that
we
should
attempt
this
desert
,
and
perhaps
we
should
not
find
it
so
long
as
we
fear
;
and
however
,
he
propose
that
we
should
see
how
far
our
provision
would
carry
us
,
and
,
in
particular
,
our
water
;
and
we
should
venture
no
further
than
half
so
far
as
our
water
would
last
;
and
if
we
find
no
end
of
the
desert
,
we
may
come
safely
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
this
advice
be
so
reasonable
that
we
all
approve
of
it
;
and
accordingly
we
calculate
that
we
be
able
to
carry
provision
for
forty
-
two
day
,
but
that
we
could
not
carry
water
for
above
twenty
day
,
though
we
be
to
suppose
it
to
stink
,
too
,
before
that
time
expire
.
<EOS>
so
that
we
conclude
that
,
if
we
do
not
come
at
some
water
in
ten
day
'
time
,
we
would
return
;
but
if
we
find
a
supply
of
water
,
we
could
then
travel
twenty
-
one
day
;
and
,
if
we
see
no
end
of
the
wilderness
in
that
time
,
we
would
return
also
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
regulation
of
our
measure
,
we
descend
the
mountain
,
and
it
be
the
second
day
before
we
quite
reach
the
plain
;
where
,
however
,
to
make
us
amend
,
we
find
a
fine
little
rivulet
of
very
good
water
,
abundance
of
deer
,
a
sort
of
creature
like
a
hare
,
but
not
so
nimble
,
but
whose
flesh
we
find
very
agreeable
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
deceive
in
our
intelligence
,
for
we
find
no
people
;
so
we
get
no
more
prisoner
to
assist
us
in
carry
our
baggage
.
  
<EOS>
the
infinite
number
of
deer
and
other
creature
which
we
see
here
<EOS>
,
we
find
be
occasion
by
the
neighbourhood
of
the
waste
or
desert
,
from
whence
they
retire
hither
for
food
and
refreshment
.
<EOS>
We
store
ourselves
here
with
flesh
and
root
of
diver
kind
,
which
our
negro
understand
better
than
we
,
and
which
serve
us
for
bread
;
and
with
as
much
water
as
(
by
the
allowance
of
a
quart
a
day
to
a
man
for
our
negro
,
and
three
pint
a
day
a
man
for
ourselves
,
and
three
quart
a
day
each
for
our
buffalo
)
would
serve
us
twenty
day
;
and
thus
load
for
a
long
miserable
march
,
we
set
forwards
,
be
all
sound
in
health
and
very
cheerful
,
but
not
alike
strong
for
so
great
a
fatigue
;
and
,
which
be
our
grievance
,
be
without
a
guide
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
very
first
entrance
of
the
waste
we
be
exceedingly
discourage
,
for
we
find
the
sand
<EOS>
so
deep
,
and
it
scald
our
foot
so
much
with
the
heat
,
that
after
we
have
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
wade
rather
than
walk
through
it
about
seven
or
eight
mile
<EOS>
,
we
be
all
heartily
tired
and
faint
;
even
the
very
negro
lay
down
and
pant
like
creature
that
have
be
push
beyond
their
strength
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
find
the
difference
of
lodge
greatly
injurious
to
us
;
for
,
as
before
,
we
always
make
us
hut
to
sleep
under
,
which
cover
us
from
the
night
air
,
which
be
particularly
unwholesome
in
those
hot
country
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
here
no
shelter
,
no
lodging
,
after
so
hard
a
march
;
for
here
be
no
tree
,
no
,
not
a
shrub
near
us
;
and
,
which
be
still
more
frightful
,
<EOS>
towards
night
we
begin
to
hear
the
wolf
howl
,
the
lion
bellow
,
and
a
great
many
wild
ass
bray
,
and
other
ugly
noise
which
we
do
not
understand
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
we
reflect
upon
our
indiscretion
,
that
we
have
not
,
at
least
,
bring
pole
or
stake
in
our
hand
,
with
which
we
may
have
,
as
it
be
,
palisadoe
ourselves
in
for
the
night
,
and
so
we
may
have
sleep
secure
<EOS>
,
whatever
other
inconvenience
we
suffer
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
find
a
way
at
last
to
relieve
ourselves
a
little
;
for
first
we
set
up
the
lance
and
bow
we
have
,
and
endeavour
to
bring
the
top
of
them
as
near
to
one
another
as
we
could
,
and
so
hang
our
coat
on
the
top
of
them
,
which
make
us
a
kind
of
sorry
tent
.
<EOS>
the
leopard
's
skin
,
and
a
few
other
skin
we
have
put
together
,
make
us
a
tolerable
covering
,
and
thus
we
lay
down
to
sleep
,
and
sleep
very
heartily
too
,
for
the
first
night
;
setting
,
however
,
a
good
watch
,
be
two
of
our
own
man
with
their
fuze
,
whom
we
relieve
in
an
hour
at
first
,
and
two
hour
afterwards
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
very
well
<EOS>
we
do
this
,
for
they
find
the
wilderness
swarm
with
rage
creature
of
all
kind
,
some
of
which
come
directly
up
to
the
very
enclosure
of
our
tent
.
<EOS>
but
our
sentinel
be
order
not
to
alarm
us
with
firing
in
the
night
,
but
to
flash
in
the
pan
at
them
,
which
they
do
,
and
find
it
effectual
,
for
the
creature
go
off
always
as
soon
as
they
see
it
,
perhaps
with
some
noise
or
howling
,
and
pursue
such
other
game
as
they
be
upon
.
  
<EOS>
if
we
be
tired
with
the
day
's
travel
,
we
be
all
as
much
tired
with
the
night
's
lodging
.
<EOS>
but
our
black
prince
tell
us
in
the
morning
he
would
give
us
some
counsel
,
and
indeed
it
be
very
good
counsel
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
we
should
be
all
kill
if
we
go
on
this
journey
,
and
through
this
desert
,
without
some
covering
for
us
at
night
;
so
he
advise
us
to
march
back
again
to
a
little
river
-
side
where
we
lay
the
night
before
,
and
stay
there
till
we
could
make
us
house
,
as
he
call
them
,
to
carry
with
us
to
lodge
in
every
night
.
<EOS>
as
he
begin
a
little
to
understand
our
speech
,
and
we
very
well
to
understand
his
sign
,
we
easily
know
what
he
mean
,
and
that
we
should
there
make
mat
(
for
we
remember
that
we
see
a
great
deal
of
matting
or
bass
there
,
that
the
native
make
mat
of
)
 
I
say
,
that
we
should
make
large
mat
there
for
cover
our
hut
or
tent
to
lodge
in
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
approve
this
advice
,
and
immediately
resolve
to
go
back
that
one
day
's
journey
,
resolve
,
though
we
carry
less
provision
,
we
would
carry
mat
with
us
to
cover
us
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
nimblest
of
us
get
back
to
the
river
with
more
ease
than
we
have
travel
it
the
day
before
;
but
,
as
we
be
not
in
haste
,
the
rest
make
a
halt
,
encamp
another
night
,
and
come
to
us
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
in
our
return
of
this
day
's
journey
,
our
man
that
make
two
day
of
it
meet
with
a
very
surprising
thing
,
that
give
them
some
reason
to
be
careful
how
they
part
company
again
.
<EOS>
the
case
be
this
:
 
the
second
day
in
the
morning
,
before
they
have
go
half
a
mile
,
look
behind
them
<EOS>
they
see
a
vast
cloud
of
sand
or
dust
rise
in
the
air
,
as
we
see
sometimes
in
the
road
in
summer
when
it
be
very
dusty
and
a
large
drove
of
cattle
be
come
,
only
very
much
great
;
and
they
could
easily
perceive
that
it
come
after
them
;
and
it
come
on
faster
as
they
go
from
it
.
<EOS>
the
cloud
of
sand
be
so
great
that
they
could
not
see
what
it
be
that
raise
it
,
and
conclude
that
it
be
some
army
of
enemy
that
pursue
them
;
but
then
consider
that
they
come
from
the
vast
uninhabited
wilderness
,
they
know
it
be
impossible
any
nation
or
people
that
way
should
have
intelligence
of
them
or
the
way
of
their
march
;
and
therefore
,
if
it
be
an
army
,
it
must
be
of
such
as
they
be
,
travel
that
way
by
accident
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
as
they
know
that
there
be
no
horse
in
the
country
,
and
that
they
come
on
so
fast
,
they
conclude
that
it
must
be
some
vast
collection
of
wild
beast
,
perhaps
make
to
the
hill
country
for
food
or
water
,
and
that
they
should
be
all
devour
or
trample
under
foot
by
their
multitude
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
thought
,
they
very
prudently
observe
which
way
the
cloud
seem
to
point
,
and
they
turn
a
little
out
of
their
way
to
the
north
,
suppose
it
may
pass
by
them
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
they
halt
to
see
what
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
negro
,
a
nimbler
fellow
than
the
rest
,
go
back
a
little
,
and
come
in
a
few
minute
run
as
fast
as
the
heavy
sand
would
allow
,
and
by
sign
give
them
to
know
that
it
be
a
great
herd
,
or
drive
,
or
whatever
it
may
be
call
,
of
vast
monstrous
elephant
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
a
sight
our
man
have
never
see
,
they
be
desirous
to
see
it
,
and
yet
a
little
uneasy
at
the
danger
too
;
for
though
an
elephant
be
a
heavy
unwieldy
creature
,
yet
in
the
deep
sand
,
which
be
nothing
at
all
to
them
,
they
march
at
a
great
rate
,
and
would
soon
have
tire
our
people
,
if
they
have
have
far
to
go
,
and
have
be
pursue
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
Our
gunner
be
with
them
,
and
have
a
great
mind
to
have
go
close
up
to
one
of
the
outermost
of
them
,
and
to
have
clap
his
piece
to
his
ear
,
and
to
have
fire
into
him
,
because
he
have
be
tell
no
shot
would
penetrate
them
;
but
they
all
dissuade
him
,
lest
upon
the
noise
they
should
all
turn
upon
and
pursue
us
;
so
he
be
reason
out
of
it
,
and
let
them
pass
,
which
,
in
our
people
's
circumstance
,
be
certainly
the
right
way
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
between
twenty
and
thirty
in
number
,
but
prodigious
great
one
;
and
though
they
often
show
our
man
that
they
see
them
,
yet
they
do
not
turn
out
of
their
way
,
or
take
any
other
notice
of
them
than
,
as
we
may
say
,
just
to
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
We
that
be
before
see
the
cloud
of
dust
they
raise
,
but
we
have
think
it
have
be
our
own
caravan
,
and
so
take
no
notice
;
but
as
they
bend
their
course
one
point
of
the
compass
,
or
thereabout
,
to
the
southward
of
the
east
,
and
we
go
due
east
<EOS>
[
?
west
]
,
they
pass
by
us
at
some
little
distance
;
so
that
we
do
not
see
them
,
or
know
anything
of
them
,
till
evening
,
when
our
man
come
to
us
and
give
us
this
account
of
them
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
a
useful
experiment
for
our
future
conduct
in
pass
the
desert
,
as
you
shall
hear
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
upon
our
work
,
and
our
black
prince
be
head
surveyor
,
for
he
be
an
excellent
mat
-
maker
himself
,
and
all
his
man
understand
it
,
so
that
they
soon
make
us
near
a
hundred
mat
;
and
as
every
man
,
I
mean
of
the
negro
,
carry
one
,
it
be
no
manner
of
load
,
and
we
do
not
carry
an
ounce
of
provision
the
less
.
<EOS>
the
great
burthen
be
to
carry
six
long
pole
,
besides
some
short
stake
;
but
the
negro
make
an
advantage
of
that
,
for
carry
them
between
two
,
they
make
the
luggage
of
provision
which
they
have
to
carry
so
much
the
light
,
bind
it
upon
two
pole
,
and
so
make
three
couple
of
them
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
see
this
,
we
make
a
little
advantage
of
it
too
;
for
have
three
or
four
bag
,
call
bottle
(
I
mean
skin
to
carry
water
)
,
more
than
the
man
could
carry
,
we
get
them
fill
,
and
carry
them
this
way
,
which
be
a
day
's
water
and
more
,
for
our
journey
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
end
our
work
,
make
our
mat
,
and
fully
recruit
our
store
of
all
thing
necessary
,
and
have
make
us
abundance
of
small
rope
of
mat
for
ordinary
use
,
as
we
may
have
occasion
,
we
set
forward
again
,
have
interrupt
our
journey
eight
day
in
all
,
upon
this
affair
.
<EOS>
to
our
great
comfort
,
the
night
before
we
set
out
there
fall
a
very
violent
shower
of
rain
,
the
effect
of
which
we
find
in
the
sand
;
though
the
heat
of
one
day
dry
the
surface
as
much
as
before
,
yet
it
be
hard
at
bottom
,
not
so
heavy
,
and
be
cool
to
our
foot
,
<EOS>
by
which
mean
we
march
,
as
we
reckon
,
about
fourteen
mile
instead
of
seven
,
and
with
much
more
ease
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
encamp
,
we
have
all
thing
ready
,
for
we
have
fit
our
tent
,
and
set
it
up
for
trial
,
where
we
make
it
;
so
that
,
in
less
than
an
hour
,
we
have
a
large
tent
raise
,
with
an
inner
and
outer
apartment
,
and
two
entrance
.
<EOS>
in
one
we
lie
ourselves
,
in
the
other
our
negro
,
have
light
pleasant
mat
over
us
,
and
other
at
the
same
time
under
us
.
<EOS>
also
we
have
a
little
place
without
all
for
our
buffalo
,
for
they
deserve
our
care
,
be
very
useful
to
us
,
besides
carry
forage
and
water
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
Their
forage
be
a
root
,
which
our
black
prince
direct
us
to
find
,
not
much
unlike
a
parsnip
,
very
moist
and
nourish
,
of
which
there
be
plenty
wherever
we
come
,
this
horrid
desert
except
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
the
next
morning
to
decamp
,
our
negro
take
down
the
tent
,
and
pull
up
the
stake
;
and
all
be
in
motion
in
as
little
time
as
it
be
set
up
.
<EOS>
in
this
posture
we
march
eight
day
,
and
yet
could
see
no
end
,
<EOS>
no
change
of
our
prospect
,
but
all
look
as
wild
and
dismal
as
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
alteration
,
it
be
that
the
sand
be
nowhere
so
deep
and
heavy
as
it
be
the
first
three
day
.
<EOS>
this
we
think
may
be
because
,
for
six
month
of
the
year
the
wind
blow
west
(
as
for
the
other
six
they
blow
constantly
east
)
,
the
sand
be
drive
violently
to
the
side
of
the
desert
where
we
set
out
,
where
the
mountain
lie
very
high
,
the
easterly
monsoon
,
when
they
blow
,
have
not
the
same
power
to
drive
it
back
again
;
and
this
be
confirm
by
our
find
the
like
depth
of
sand
on
the
farth
extent
of
the
desert
to
the
west
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
ninth
day
of
our
travel
in
this
wilderness
,
when
we
come
to
the
view
of
a
great
lake
of
water
;
and
you
may
be
sure
this
be
a
particular
satisfaction
to
us
,
because
we
have
not
water
leave
for
above
two
or
three
day
more
,
at
our
short
allowance
;
I
mean
allow
water
for
our
return
,
if
we
have
be
drive
to
the
necessity
of
it
.
<EOS>
Our
water
have
serve
us
two
day
longer
than
expect
,
our
buffalo
have
find
,
for
two
or
three
day
,
a
kind
of
herb
like
a
broad
flat
thistle
,
though
without
any
prickle
,
spread
on
the
ground
,
and
grow
in
the
sand
,
which
they
eat
freely
of
,
and
which
supply
them
for
drink
as
well
as
forage
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
which
be
the
tenth
from
our
set
out
,
we
come
to
the
edge
of
this
lake
,
and
,
very
happily
for
us
,
we
come
to
it
at
the
south
point
of
it
,
for
to
the
north
we
could
see
no
end
of
it
;
so
we
pass
by
it
and
travel
three
day
by
the
side
of
it
,
which
be
a
great
comfort
to
us
,
because
it
lighten
our
burthen
,
there
be
no
need
to
carry
water
when
we
have
it
in
view
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
though
here
be
so
much
water
,
we
find
but
<EOS>
very
little
alteration
in
the
desert
;
no
tree
,
no
grass
or
herbage
,
except
that
thistle
,
as
I
call
it
,
and
two
or
three
more
plant
,
which
we
do
not
understand
,
of
which
the
desert
begin
to
be
pretty
full
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
we
be
refresh
with
the
neighbourhood
of
this
lake
of
water
,
so
we
be
now
get
among
a
prodigious
number
of
ravenous
inhabitant
,
the
like
whereof
<EOS>
,
it
be
most
certain
,
<EOS>
the
eye
of
man
never
see
;
for
as
I
firmly
believe
that
never
man
nor
body
of
man
pass
this
desert
since
the
flood
,
so
I
believe
there
be
not
the
like
collection
of
fierce
,
ravenous
,
and
devour
creature
in
the
world
;
I
mean
not
in
any
particular
place
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
day
's
journey
before
we
come
to
this
lake
,
and
all
the
three
day
we
be
pass
by
it
,
and
.
<EOS>
for
six
or
seven
day
'
march
after
it
,
the
ground
be
scatter
with
elephant
'
tooth
in
such
a
number
as
be
incredible
;
and
as
some
of
them
have
lain
there
for
some
hundred
of
year
,
so
,
see
the
substance
of
them
scarce
ever
decay
,
they
may
lie
there
,
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
,
to
the
end
of
time
.
<EOS>
the
size
of
some
of
them
be
,
it
seem
,
to
those
to
whom
I
have
report
it
,
as
incredible
as
the
number
;
and
I
can
assure
you
there
be
several
so
heavy
as
the
strong
man
among
us
could
not
lift
.
<EOS>
as
to
number
,
I
question
not
but
there
be
enough
to
load
a
thousand
sail
of
the
big
ship
in
the
world
,
by
which
I
may
be
understand
to
mean
that
the
quantity
be
not
to
be
conceive
of
;
see
that
as
they
last
in
view
for
above
eighty
mile
'
travelling
,
so
they
may
continue
as
far
to
the
right
hand
,
and
to
the
left
as
far
,
and
many
time
as
far
,
for
aught
we
know
;
for
it
seem
the
number
of
elephant
hereabouts
be
prodigiously
great
.
<EOS>
in
one
place
in
particular
we
see
the
head
of
an
elephant
,
with
several
tooth
in
it
,
but
one
of
the
big
that
ever
I
see
;
the
flesh
be
consume
,
to
be
sure
,
many
hundred
year
before
,
and
all
the
other
bone
;
but
three
of
our
strong
man
could
not
lift
this
skull
and
tooth
;
the
great
tooth
,
I
believe
,
weigh
at
least
three
hundredweight
;
and
this
be
particularly
remarkable
to
me
,
that
I
observe
the
whole
skull
be
as
good
ivory
as
the
tooth
,
and
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
altogether
weigh
at
least
six
hundredweight
;
and
though
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
,
by
the
same
rule
,
all
the
bone
of
the
elephant
may
be
ivory
,
yet
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
this
just
objection
against
it
from
the
example
before
me
,
that
then
all
the
other
bone
of
this
elephant
would
have
be
there
as
well
as
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
I
propose
to
our
gunner
,
that
,
see
we
have
travel
now
fourteen
day
without
intermission
,
and
that
we
have
water
here
for
our
refreshment
,
and
no
want
of
food
yet
,
nor
any
fear
of
it
,
we
should
rest
our
people
a
little
,
and
see
,
at
the
same
time
,
if
perhaps
we
may
kill
some
creature
that
be
proper
for
food
.
<EOS>
the
gunner
,
who
have
more
forecast
of
that
kind
than
I
have
,
agree
to
the
proposal
,
and
add
,
why
may
we
not
try
to
catch
some
fish
out
of
the
lake
?
<EOS>
the
first
thing
we
have
before
us
be
to
try
if
we
could
make
any
hook
,
and
this
indeed
put
our
artificer
to
his
trump
;
however
,
with
some
labour
and
difficulty
,
he
do
it
,
and
we
catch
fresh
fish
of
several
kind
.
<EOS>
how
they
come
there
,
none
but
He
that
make
the
lake
and
all
the
world
know
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
no
human
hand
ever
put
any
in
there
,
or
pull
any
out
before
.
  
<EOS>
We
not
only
catch
enough
for
our
present
refreshment
,
but
we
dry
several
large
fish
,
of
kind
which
I
can
not
describe
,
in
the
sun
,
by
which
we
lengthen
out
our
provision
considerably
;
for
the
heat
of
the
sun
dry
them
so
effectually
without
salt
that
they
be
perfectly
cure
,
dry
,
and
hard
,
in
one
day
's
time
.
  
<EOS>
We
rest
ourselves
here
five
day
;
during
which
time
we
have
abundance
of
pleasant
adventure
with
the
wild
creature
,
too
many
to
relate
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
very
particular
,
which
be
a
chase
between
a
she
-
lion
,
or
lioness
,
and
a
large
deer
;
and
though
the
deer
be
naturally
a
very
nimble
creature
,
and
she
fly
by
us
like
the
wind
,
have
,
perhaps
,
about
300
yard
the
start
of
the
lion
,
yet
we
find
the
lion
,
by
her
strength
,
and
the
goodness
of
her
lung
,
get
ground
of
her
.
<EOS>
They
pass
by
us
within
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
and
we
have
a
view
of
them
a
great
way
,
when
,
have
give
them
over
,
we
be
surprised
,
about
an
hour
after
,
to
see
them
come
thunder
back
again
on
the
other
side
of
us
,
and
then
the
lion
be
within
thirty
or
forty
yard
of
her
;
and
both
strain
to
the
extremity
of
their
speed
,
when
the
deer
,
come
to
the
lake
,
plunge
into
the
water
,
and
swam
for
her
life
,
as
she
have
before
run
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
lioness
plunge
in
after
her
,
and
swam
a
little
way
,
but
come
back
again
;
and
when
she
be
get
upon
the
land
she
set
up
the
most
hideous
roar
that
ever
I
hear
in
my
life
,
as
if
do
in
the
rage
of
have
lose
her
prey
.
  
<EOS>
We
walk
out
morning
and
evening
constantly
;
the
middle
of
the
day
we
refresh
ourselves
under
our
tent
.
<EOS>
but
one
morning
early
we
see
another
chase
,
which
more
nearly
concern
us
than
the
other
;
for
our
black
prince
,
walk
by
the
side
of
the
lake
,
be
set
upon
by
a
vast
,
great
crocodile
,
which
come
out
of
the
lake
upon
him
;
and
though
he
be
very
light
of
foot
,
yet
it
be
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
He
flee
amain
to
us
,
and
the
truth
be
,
we
do
not
know
what
to
do
,
for
we
be
tell
no
bullet
would
enter
her
;
and
we
find
it
so
at
first
,
for
though
three
of
our
man
fire
at
her
,
yet
she
do
not
mind
them
;
but
my
friend
the
gunner
,
a
venturous
fellow
,
of
a
bold
heart
,
and
great
presence
of
mind
,
go
up
so
near
as
to
thrust
the
muzzle
of
his
piece
into
her
mouth
,
and
fire
,
but
let
his
piece
fall
,
and
run
for
it
the
very
moment
he
have
fire
it
.
<EOS>
the
creature
rage
a
great
while
,
and
spend
its
fury
upon
the
gun
,
make
mark
upon
the
very
iron
with
its
tooth
,
but
after
some
time
faint
and
die
.
  
<EOS>
Our
negro
spread
the
bank
of
the
lake
all
this
while
for
game
,
and
at
length
kill
us
three
deer
,
one
of
them
very
large
,
the
other
two
very
small
.
<EOS>
there
be
water
-
fowl
also
in
the
lake
,
but
we
never
come
near
enough
to
them
to
shoot
any
;
and
as
for
the
desert
,
we
see
no
fowl
anywhere
in
it
<EOS>
but
at
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
We
likewise
kill
two
or
three
civet
cat
;
but
their
flesh
be
the
bad
of
carrion
.
<EOS>
We
see
abundance
of
elephant
at
a
distance
,
and
observe
they
always
go
in
very
good
company
,
that
be
to
say
,
abundance
of
them
together
,
and
always
extend
in
a
fair
line
of
battle
;
and
this
,
they
say
,
be
the
way
they
defend
themselves
from
their
enemy
;
<EOS>
for
if
lion
or
tiger
,
wolf
or
any
creature
,
attack
them
,
they
be
draw
in
a
line
,
sometimes
reach
five
or
six
mile
in
length
,
whatever
come
in
their
way
be
sure
to
be
trod
under
foot
,
or
beat
in
piece
with
their
trunk
,
or
lift
up
in
the
air
with
their
trunk
;
so
that
if
a
hundred
lion
or
tiger
be
come
along
,
if
they
meet
a
line
of
elephant
,
they
will
always
fly
back
till
they
see
room
to
pass
by
the
right
hand
or
the
left
;
and
if
they
do
not
,
it
would
be
impossible
for
one
of
them
to
escape
;
for
the
elephant
,
though
a
heavy
creature
,
be
yet
so
dexterous
and
nimble
with
his
trunk
,
that
he
will
not
fail
to
lift
up
the
heavy
lion
,
or
any
other
wild
creature
,
and
throw
him
up
in
the
air
quite
over
his
back
,
and
then
trample
him
to
death
with
his
foot
.
<EOS>
We
see
several
line
of
battle
thus
;
we
see
one
so
long
that
indeed
there
be
no
end
of
it
to
be
see
,
and
I
believe
there
may
be
2000
elephant
in
row
or
line
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
beast
of
prey
,
but
live
upon
the
herbage
of
the
field
,
as
an
ox
do
;
and
it
be
say
,
that
though
they
be
so
great
a
creature
,
yet
that
a
small
quantity
of
forage
supply
one
of
them
than
will
suffice
a
horse
.
  
<EOS>
the
number
of
this
kind
of
creature
that
be
in
those
part
be
inconceivable
,
as
may
be
gather
from
the
prodigious
quantity
of
tooth
which
,
as
I
say
,
we
see
in
this
vast
desert
;
and
indeed
we
see
a
hundred
of
them
to
one
of
any
other
kind
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
we
be
very
much
surprised
.
<EOS>
We
be
most
of
us
lay
down
on
our
mat
to
sleep
,
when
our
watch
come
run
in
among
us
,
be
fright
with
the
sudden
roaring
of
some
lion
just
by
them
,
which
,
it
seem
,
they
have
not
see
,
the
night
be
dark
,
till
they
be
just
upon
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
as
it
prove
,
an
old
lion
and
his
whole
family
,
for
there
be
the
lioness
and
three
young
lion
,
besides
the
old
king
,
who
be
a
monstrous
great
one
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
young
one
 
who
be
good
,
large
,
well
-
grow
one
too
 
leap
up
upon
one
of
our
negro
,
who
stand
sentinel
,
before
he
see
him
,
at
which
he
be
heartily
fright
,
cry
out
,
and
run
into
the
tent
.
<EOS>
Our
other
man
,
who
have
a
gun
,
have
not
presence
of
mind
at
first
to
shoot
him
,
but
strike
him
with
the
butt
-
end
of
his
piece
,
which
make
him
whine
a
little
,
and
then
growl
at
him
fearfully
;
but
the
fellow
retire
,
and
,
we
be
all
alarm
,
three
of
our
man
snatch
up
their
gun
,
run
to
the
tent
door
,
where
they
see
the
great
old
lion
by
the
fire
of
his
eye
,
and
first
fire
at
him
,
but
,
we
suppose
,
miss
him
,
or
at
least
do
not
kill
him
;
for
they
go
all
off
,
but
raise
a
most
hideous
roar
,
which
,
as
if
they
have
call
for
help
,
bring
down
a
prodigious
number
of
lion
,
and
other
furious
creature
,
we
know
not
what
,
about
them
,
for
we
could
not
see
them
;
but
there
be
a
noise
,
and
yelling
and
howl
,
and
all
sort
of
such
wilderness
music
on
every
side
of
us
,
as
if
all
the
beast
of
the
desert
be
assemble
to
devour
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
ask
our
black
prince
what
we
should
do
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
Me
go
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
fright
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
he
snatch
up
two
or
three
of
the
bad
of
our
mat
,
and
get
one
of
our
man
to
strike
some
fire
,
he
hang
the
mat
up
at
the
end
of
a
pole
,
and
set
it
on
fire
,
and
it
blaze
abroad
a
good
while
;
at
which
the
creature
all
move
off
,
for
we
hear
them
roar
,
and
make
their
bellowing
noise
at
a
great
distance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
our
gunner
,
"
if
that
will
do
,
we
need
not
burn
our
mat
,
which
be
our
bed
to
lay
under
us
,
and
our
tilting
to
cover
us
.
<EOS>
let
me
alone
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
so
he
come
back
into
our
tent
,
and
fall
to
make
some
artificial
firework
and
the
like
;
and
he
give
our
sentinel
some
to
be
ready
at
hand
upon
occasion
,
and
particularly
he
place
a
great
piece
of
wild
-
fire
upon
the
same
pole
that
the
mat
have
be
tie
to
,
and
set
it
on
fire
,
and
that
burn
there
so
long
that
all
the
wild
creature
leave
us
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
we
begin
to
be
weary
of
such
company
;
and
,
to
be
rid
of
them
,
we
set
forward
again
two
day
sooner
than
we
intend
.
<EOS>
We
find
now
,
that
though
the
desert
do
not
end
,
nor
could
we
see
any
appearance
of
it
,
yet
that
the
earth
be
pretty
full
of
green
stuff
of
one
sort
or
another
,
so
that
our
cattle
have
no
want
;
and
secondly
,
that
there
be
several
little
river
which
run
into
the
lake
,
and
so
long
as
the
country
continue
low
,
we
find
water
sufficient
,
which
ease
us
very
much
in
our
carriage
,
and
we
go
on
still
sixteen
day
more
without
yet
come
to
any
appearance
of
well
soil
.
<EOS>
after
this
we
find
the
country
rise
a
little
,
and
by
that
we
perceive
that
the
water
would
fail
us
;
so
,
for
fear
of
the
bad
,
we
fill
our
bladder
-
bottle
with
water
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
country
rise
gradually
thus
for
three
day
continually
,
when
,
on
the
sudden
,
we
perceive
that
,
though
we
have
mount
up
insensibly
,
yet
that
we
be
on
the
top
of
a
very
high
ridge
of
hill
,
though
not
such
as
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
look
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
,
we
see
,
to
the
great
joy
of
all
our
heart
,
that
the
desert
be
at
an
end
;
that
the
country
be
clothe
with
green
,
abundance
of
tree
,
and
a
large
river
;
and
we
make
no
doubt
but
that
we
should
find
people
and
cattle
also
;
and
here
,
by
our
gunner
's
account
,
who
keep
our
computation
,
we
have
march
about
400
mile
over
this
dismal
place
of
horror
,
have
be
four
-
and
-
thirty
day
a
-
doing
of
it
,
and
consequently
be
come
about
1100
mile
of
our
journey
.
  
<EOS>
We
would
willingly
have
descend
the
hill
that
night
,
but
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
we
see
everything
more
plain
,
and
rest
ourselves
under
the
shade
of
some
tree
,
which
be
now
the
most
refreshing
thing
imaginable
to
us
,
who
have
be
scorch
above
a
month
without
a
tree
to
cover
us
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
country
here
very
pleasant
,
especially
consider
that
we
come
from
;
and
we
kill
some
deer
here
also
,
which
we
find
very
frequent
under
the
cover
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
also
we
kill
a
creature
like
a
goat
,
whose
flesh
be
very
good
to
eat
,
but
it
be
no
goat
;
we
find
also
a
great
number
of
fowl
like
partridge
,
but
something
small
,
and
be
very
tame
;
so
that
we
live
here
very
well
,
but
find
no
people
,
at
least
none
that
would
be
see
,
no
,
not
for
several
day
'
journey
;
and
to
allay
our
joy
<EOS>
,
we
be
almost
every
night
disturb
with
lion
and
tiger
;
elephant
,
indeed
,
we
see
none
here
.
  
<EOS>
in
three
day
'
march
we
come
to
a
river
,
which
we
see
from
the
hill
,
and
which
we
call
the
Golden
River
;
and
we
find
it
run
northward
,
which
be
the
first
stream
we
have
meet
with
that
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
run
with
a
very
rapid
current
,
and
our
gunner
,
pull
out
his
map
,
assure
me
that
this
be
either
the
river
Nile
,
or
run
into
the
great
lake
out
of
which
<EOS>
the
river
Nile
be
say
to
take
its
beginning
;
and
he
bring
out
his
chart
and
map
,
which
,
by
his
instruction
,
I
begin
to
understand
very
well
,
and
tell
me
he
would
convince
me
of
it
,
and
indeed
he
seem
to
make
it
so
plain
to
me
that
I
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
enter
into
the
gunner
's
reason
for
this
inquiry
,
not
in
the
least
,
till
he
go
on
with
it
farther
,
and
state
it
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
if
this
be
the
river
Nile
,
why
should
not
we
build
some
more
canoe
,
and
go
down
this
stream
,
rather
than
expose
ourselves
to
any
more
desert
and
scorch
sand
in
quest
of
the
sea
,
which
when
we
be
come
to
,
we
shall
be
as
much
at
a
loss
how
to
get
home
as
we
be
at
Madagascar
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
argument
be
good
,
have
there
be
no
objection
in
the
way
of
a
kind
which
none
of
us
be
capable
of
answer
;
but
,
upon
the
whole
,
it
be
an
undertaking
of
such
a
nature
that
every
one
of
us
think
it
impracticable
,
and
that
upon
several
account
;
and
our
surgeon
,
who
be
himself
a
good
scholar
and
a
man
of
reading
,
though
not
acquaint
with
the
business
of
sailing
,
oppose
it
,
and
some
of
his
reason
,
I
remember
,
be
such
as
these
:
 
first
,
the
length
of
the
way
,
which
both
he
and
the
gunner
allow
,
by
the
course
of
the
water
,
and
turning
of
the
river
,
would
be
at
least
4000
mile
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
the
innumerable
crocodile
in
the
river
,
which
we
should
never
be
able
to
escape
.
<EOS>
thirdly
,
the
dreadful
desert
in
the
way
;
and
lastly
,
the
approach
rainy
season
,
in
which
the
stream
of
the
Nile
would
be
so
furious
,
and
rise
so
high
 
spread
far
and
wide
over
all
the
plain
country
 
that
we
should
never
be
able
to
know
when
we
be
in
the
channel
of
the
river
and
when
not
,
and
should
certainly
be
cast
away
,
overset
,
or
run
aground
so
often
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
proceed
by
a
river
so
excessively
dangerous
.
  
<EOS>
this
last
reason
he
make
so
plain
to
us
that
we
begin
to
be
sensible
of
it
ourselves
,
so
that
we
agree
to
lay
that
thought
aside
,
and
proceed
in
our
first
course
,
westwards
towards
the
sea
;
but
,
as
if
we
have
be
loth
to
depart
,
we
continue
,
by
way
of
refresh
ourselves
,
to
loiter
two
day
upon
this
river
,
in
which
time
our
black
prince
,
who
delight
much
in
wander
up
and
down
,
come
one
evening
and
bring
us
several
little
bit
of
something
,
he
know
not
what
,
but
he
find
it
feel
heavy
and
look
well
,
and
show
it
to
me
as
what
he
think
be
some
rarity
.
<EOS>
I
take
not
much
notice
of
it
to
him
,
but
step
out
and
call
the
gunner
to
me
<EOS>
I
show
it
to
him
,
and
tell
him
what
I
think
,
viz
.
,
that
it
be
certainly
gold
.
<EOS>
He
agree
with
me
in
that
,
and
also
in
what
follow
,
that
we
would
take
the
black
prince
out
with
us
the
next
day
,
and
make
him
show
us
where
he
find
it
;
that
if
there
be
any
quantity
to
be
find
we
would
tell
our
company
of
it
,
but
if
there
be
but
little
we
would
keep
counsel
,
and
have
it
to
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
forgot
to
engage
the
prince
in
the
secret
,
who
innocently
tell
so
much
to
all
the
rest
,
as
that
they
guess
what
it
be
,
and
come
to
us
to
see
.
<EOS>
when
we
find
it
be
public
,
we
be
more
concerned
to
prevent
their
suspecting
that
we
have
any
design
to
conceal
it
,
and
openly
tell
our
thought
of
it
,
we
call
our
artificer
,
who
agree
presently
that
it
be
gold
;
so
I
propose
that
we
should
all
go
with
the
prince
to
the
place
where
he
find
it
,
and
if
any
quantity
be
to
be
have
,
we
would
lie
here
some
time
and
see
what
we
could
make
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
we
go
every
man
of
us
,
for
no
man
be
willing
to
be
leave
behind
in
a
discovery
of
such
a
nature
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
place
we
find
it
be
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
,
not
in
the
main
river
,
but
in
another
small
river
or
stream
which
come
from
the
west
,
and
run
into
the
other
at
that
place
.
<EOS>
We
fall
to
rake
in
the
sand
,
and
wash
it
in
our
hand
;
and
we
seldom
take
up
a
handful
of
sand
<EOS>
but
we
wash
some
little
round
lump
as
big
as
a
pin
's
head
,
or
sometimes
as
big
as
a
grape
stone
,
into
our
hand
;
and
we
find
,
in
two
or
three
hour
'
time
,
that
every
one
have
get
some
,
so
we
agree
to
leave
off
,
and
go
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
eat
,
it
come
into
my
thought
that
while
we
work
at
this
rate
in
a
thing
of
such
nicety
and
consequence
,
it
be
ten
to
one
if
the
gold
,
which
be
the
make
-
bait
of
the
world
,
do
not
,
first
or
last
,
set
us
together
by
the
ear
,
to
break
our
good
article
and
our
understand
one
among
another
,
and
perhaps
cause
us
to
part
company
,
or
bad
;
I
therefore
tell
them
that
I
be
indeed
the
young
man
in
the
company
,
but
as
they
have
always
allow
me
to
give
my
opinion
in
thing
,
and
have
sometimes
be
pleased
to
follow
my
advice
,
so
I
have
something
to
propose
now
,
which
I
think
would
be
for
all
our
advantage
,
and
I
believe
they
would
all
like
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
we
be
in
a
country
where
we
all
know
there
be
a
great
deal
of
gold
,
and
that
all
the
world
send
ship
thither
to
get
it
;
that
we
do
not
indeed
know
where
it
be
,
and
so
we
may
get
a
great
deal
,
or
a
little
<EOS>
,
we
do
not
know
whether
;
but
I
offer
it
to
them
to
consider
whether
it
would
not
be
the
good
way
for
us
,
and
to
preserve
the
good
harmony
and
friendship
that
have
be
always
keep
among
us
,
and
which
be
so
absolutely
necessary
to
our
safety
,
that
what
we
find
should
be
bring
together
to
one
common
stock
,
and
be
equally
divide
at
last
,
rather
than
to
run
the
hazard
of
any
difference
which
may
happen
among
us
from
any
one
's
have
find
more
or
less
than
another
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
,
that
if
we
be
all
upon
one
bottom
we
should
all
apply
ourselves
heartily
to
the
work
;
and
,
besides
that
,
we
may
then
set
our
negro
all
to
work
for
us
,
and
receive
equally
the
fruit
of
their
labour
and
of
our
own
,
and
be
all
exactly
alike
sharer
,
there
could
be
no
just
cause
of
quarrel
or
disgust
among
us
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
approve
the
proposal
,
and
every
one
jointly
swear
,
and
give
their
hand
to
one
another
,
that
they
would
not
conceal
the
least
grain
of
gold
from
the
rest
;
and
consent
that
if
any
one
or
more
should
be
find
to
conceal
any
,
all
that
he
have
should
be
take
from
him
and
divide
among
the
rest
;
and
one
thing
more
be
add
to
it
by
our
gunner
,
from
consideration
equally
good
and
just
,
that
if
any
one
of
us
,
by
any
play
,
bet
,
game
,
or
wager
,
win
any
money
or
gold
,
or
the
value
of
any
,
from
another
,
during
our
whole
voyage
,
till
our
return
quite
to
Portugal
,
he
should
be
oblige
by
us
all
to
restore
it
again
on
the
penalty
of
be
disarm
and
turn
out
of
the
company
,
and
of
have
no
relief
from
us
on
any
account
whatever
.
<EOS>
this
be
to
prevent
wagering
and
play
for
money
,
which
our
man
be
apt
to
do
by
several
mean
and
at
several
game
,
though
they
have
neither
card
nor
dice
.
  
<EOS>
have
make
this
wholesome
agreement
,
we
go
cheerfully
to
work
,
and
show
our
negro
how
to
work
for
us
;
and
work
up
the
stream
on
both
side
,
and
in
the
bottom
of
the
river
,
we
spend
about
three
week
'
time
dabble
in
the
water
;
by
which
time
,
as
it
lie
all
in
our
way
,
we
have
go
about
six
mile
,
and
not
more
;
and
still
the
high
we
go
,
the
more
gold
we
find
;
till
at
last
,
have
pass
by
the
side
of
a
hill
,
we
perceive
on
a
sudden
that
the
gold
stop
,
and
that
there
be
not
a
bit
take
up
beyond
that
place
.
<EOS>
It
presently
occur
to
my
mind
,
that
it
must
then
be
from
the
side
of
that
little
hill
that
all
the
gold
we
find
be
work
down
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
we
go
back
to
the
hill
,
and
fall
to
work
with
that
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
earth
loose
,
and
of
a
yellowish
loamy
colour
,
and
in
some
place
a
white
hard
kind
of
stone
,
which
,
in
describe
since
to
some
of
our
artist
,
they
tell
me
be
the
spar
which
be
find
by
ore
,
and
surround
it
in
the
mine
.
<EOS>
however
,
if
it
have
be
all
gold
,
we
have
no
instrument
to
force
it
out
;
so
we
pass
that
.
<EOS>
but
scratch
into
the
loose
earth
with
our
finger
,
we
come
to
a
surprising
place
,
where
the
earth
,
for
the
quantity
of
two
bushel
,
I
believe
,
or
thereabout
,
crumble
down
with
little
more
than
touch
it
,
and
apparently
show
us
that
there
be
a
great
deal
of
gold
in
it
.
<EOS>
We
take
it
all
carefully
up
,
and
wash
it
in
the
water
,
the
loamy
earth
wash
away
,
and
leave
the
gold
dust
free
in
our
hand
;
and
that
which
be
more
remarkable
be
,
that
,
when
this
loose
earth
be
all
take
away
,
and
we
come
to
the
rock
or
hard
stone
,
there
be
not
one
grain
of
gold
more
to
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
at
night
we
all
come
together
to
see
what
we
have
get
;
and
it
appear
we
have
find
,
in
that
day
's
heap
of
earth
,
about
fifty
pound
'
weight
of
gold
dust
,
and
about
thirty
-
four
pound
'
weight
more
in
all
the
rest
of
our
work
in
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
happy
kind
of
disappointment
to
us
,
that
we
find
a
full
stop
put
to
our
work
;
for
,
have
the
quantity
of
gold
be
ever
so
small
,
yet
,
have
any
at
all
come
,
I
do
not
know
when
we
should
have
give
over
;
for
,
have
rummage
this
place
,
and
not
find
the
least
grain
of
gold
in
any
other
place
,
or
in
any
of
the
earth
there
,
except
in
that
loose
parcel
,
we
go
quite
back
down
the
small
river
again
,
work
it
over
and
over
again
,
as
long
as
we
could
find
anything
,
how
small
soever
;
and
we
do
get
six
or
seven
pound
more
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
then
we
go
into
the
first
river
,
and
try
it
up
the
stream
and
down
the
stream
,
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
up
the
stream
we
find
nothing
,
no
,
not
a
grain
;
down
the
stream
we
find
very
little
,
not
above
the
quantity
of
half
an
ounce
in
two
mile
'
work
;
so
back
we
come
again
to
the
Golden
River
,
as
we
justly
call
it
,
and
work
it
up
the
stream
and
down
the
stream
twice
more
apiece
,
and
every
time
we
find
some
gold
,
and
perhaps
may
have
do
so
if
we
have
stay
there
till
this
time
;
but
the
quantity
be
at
last
so
small
,
and
the
work
so
much
the
harder
,
that
we
agree
by
consent
to
give
it
over
,
lest
we
should
fatigue
ourselves
and
our
negro
so
as
to
be
quite
unfit
for
our
journey
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
bring
all
our
purchase
together
,
we
have
in
the
whole
three
pound
and
a
half
of
gold
to
a
man
,
share
and
share
alike
,
accord
to
such
a
weight
and
scale
as
our
ingenious
cutler
make
for
us
to
weigh
it
by
,
which
indeed
he
do
by
guess
,
but
which
,
as
he
say
,
he
be
sure
be
rather
more
than
less
,
and
so
it
prove
at
last
;
for
it
be
near
two
ounce
more
than
weight
in
a
pound
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
there
be
seven
or
eight
pound
'
weight
leave
,
which
we
agree
to
leave
in
his
hand
,
to
work
it
into
such
shape
as
we
think
fit
,
to
give
away
to
such
people
as
we
may
yet
meet
with
,
from
whom
we
may
have
occasion
to
buy
provision
,
or
even
to
buy
friendship
,
or
the
like
;
and
particularly
we
give
about
a
pound
to
our
black
prince
,
which
he
hammer
and
work
by
his
own
indefatigable
hand
,
and
some
tool
our
artificer
lend
him
,
into
little
round
bit
,
as
round
almost
as
bead
,
though
not
exact
in
shape
,
and
drill
hole
through
them
,
put
them
all
upon
a
string
,
and
wear
them
about
his
black
neck
,
and
they
look
very
well
there
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
but
he
be
many
month
a
-
do
it
.
<EOS>
and
thus
end
our
first
golden
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
We
now
begin
to
discover
what
we
have
not
trouble
our
head
much
about
before
,
and
that
be
,
that
,
let
the
country
be
good
or
bad
<EOS>
that
we
be
in
<EOS>
,
we
could
not
travel
much
further
for
a
considerable
time
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
now
five
month
and
upward
in
our
journey
,
and
the
season
begin
to
change
;
and
nature
tell
us
,
that
,
be
in
a
climate
that
have
a
winter
as
well
as
a
summer
,
though
of
a
different
kind
from
what
our
country
produce
,
we
be
to
expect
a
wet
season
,
and
such
as
we
should
not
be
able
to
travel
in
,
as
well
by
reason
of
the
rain
itself
,
as
of
the
flood
which
it
would
occasion
wherever
we
should
come
;
and
though
we
have
be
no
stranger
to
those
wet
season
in
the
island
of
Madagascar
,
yet
we
have
not
think
much
of
them
since
we
begin
our
travel
;
for
,
set
out
when
the
sun
be
about
the
solstice
,
that
is
,
when
it
be
at
the
great
northern
distance
from
us
,
we
have
find
the
benefit
of
it
in
our
travel
.
<EOS>
but
now
it
draw
near
us
apace
,
and
we
find
it
begin
to
rain
;
upon
which
we
call
another
general
council
,
in
which
we
debate
our
present
circumstance
,
and
,
in
particular
,
whether
we
should
go
forward
,
or
seek
for
a
proper
place
upon
the
bank
of
our
Golden
River
,
which
have
be
so
lucky
to
us
,
to
fix
our
camp
for
the
winter
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
it
be
resolve
to
abide
where
we
be
;
and
it
be
not
the
least
part
of
our
happiness
that
we
do
so
,
as
shall
appear
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
have
resolve
upon
this
,
our
first
measure
be
to
set
our
negro
to
work
,
to
make
hut
or
house
for
our
habitation
,
and
this
they
do
very
dexterously
;
only
that
we
change
the
ground
where
we
at
first
intend
it
,
think
,
as
indeed
it
happen
,
that
the
river
may
reach
it
upon
any
sudden
rain
.
<EOS>
Our
camp
be
like
a
little
town
,
in
which
our
hut
be
in
the
centre
,
have
one
large
one
in
the
centre
of
them
also
,
into
which
all
our
particular
lodging
open
;
so
that
none
of
us
go
into
our
apartment
but
through
a
public
tent
,
where
we
all
ate
and
drink
together
,
and
keep
our
council
and
society
;
and
our
carpenter
make
us
table
,
bench
,
and
stool
in
abundance
,
as
many
as
we
could
make
use
of
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
no
need
of
chimney
,
it
be
hot
enough
without
fire
;
but
yet
we
find
ourselves
at
last
oblige
to
keep
a
fire
every
night
upon
a
particular
occasion
.
<EOS>
for
though
we
have
in
all
other
respect
a
very
pleasant
and
agreeable
situation
,
yet
we
be
rather
worse
troubled
with
the
unwelcome
visit
of
wild
beast
here
than
in
the
wilderness
itself
;
for
as
the
deer
and
other
gentle
creature
come
hither
for
shelter
and
food
,
so
the
lion
and
tiger
and
leopard
haunt
these
place
continually
for
prey
.
  
<EOS>
when
first
we
discover
this
we
be
so
uneasy
at
it
that
we
think
of
remove
our
situation
;
but
after
many
debate
about
it
we
resolve
to
fortify
ourselves
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
be
in
any
danger
from
it
;
and
this
our
carpenter
undertake
,
who
first
palisade
our
camp
quite
round
with
long
stake
,
for
we
have
wood
enough
,
which
stake
be
not
stick
in
one
by
another
like
pale
,
but
in
an
irregular
manner
;
a
great
multitude
of
them
so
place
that
they
take
up
near
two
yard
in
thickness
,
<EOS>
some
high
,
some
low
,
all
sharpen
at
the
top
,
and
about
a
foot
asunder
:
so
that
have
any
creature
jump
at
them
,
unless
he
have
go
clean
over
,
which
it
be
very
hard
to
do
,
he
would
be
hang
upon
twenty
or
thirty
spike
.
  
<EOS>
the
entrance
into
this
have
large
stake
than
the
rest
,
so
place
before
one
another
as
to
make
three
or
four
short
turning
which
no
four
-
footed
beast
big
than
a
dog
could
possibly
come
in
at
;
and
that
we
may
not
be
attack
by
any
multitude
together
,
and
consequently
be
alarm
in
our
sleep
,
as
we
have
be
,
or
be
oblige
to
waste
our
ammunition
,
which
we
be
very
chary
of
<EOS>
,
we
keep
a
great
fire
every
night
without
the
entrance
of
our
palisade
,
have
a
hut
for
our
two
sentinel
to
stand
in
free
from
the
rain
,
just
within
the
entrance
,
and
right
against
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
to
maintain
this
fire
we
cut
a
prodigious
deal
of
wood
,
and
pile
it
up
in
a
heap
to
dry
,
and
with
the
green
bough
make
a
second
covering
over
our
hut
,
so
high
and
thick
that
it
may
cast
the
rain
from
the
first
,
and
keep
us
effectually
dry
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
scarcely
finish
all
these
work
but
the
rain
come
on
so
fierce
and
so
continued
that
we
have
little
time
to
stir
abroad
for
food
,
except
indeed
that
our
negro
,
who
wear
no
clothe
,
seem
to
make
nothing
of
the
rain
;
though
to
us
Europeans
,
in
those
hot
climate
,
nothing
be
more
dangerous
.
  
<EOS>
We
continue
in
this
posture
for
four
month
,
that
be
to
say
,
from
the
middle
of
June
to
the
middle
of
October
;
for
though
the
rain
go
off
,
at
least
the
great
violence
of
them
,
about
the
equinox
,
yet
,
as
the
sun
be
then
just
over
our
head
,
we
resolve
to
stay
awhile
till
it
pass
a
little
to
the
southward
.
  
<EOS>
during
our
encampment
here
we
have
several
adventure
with
the
ravenous
creature
of
that
country
;
and
have
not
our
fire
be
always
keep
burn
,
I
question
much
whether
all
our
fence
,
though
we
strengthen
it
afterwards
with
twelve
or
fourteen
row
of
stake
or
more
,
would
have
keep
us
secure
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
in
the
night
that
we
have
the
disturbance
of
them
,
and
sometimes
they
come
in
such
multitude
that
we
think
all
the
lion
and
tiger
,
and
leopard
and
wolf
of
Africa
be
come
together
to
attack
us
.
<EOS>
one
night
,
be
clear
moonshine
,
one
of
our
man
be
upon
the
watch
,
tell
us
that
he
verily
believe
he
see
ten
thousand
wild
creature
of
one
sort
or
another
pass
by
our
little
camp
,
and
ever
as
they
see
the
fire
they
sheer
off
,
but
be
sure
to
howl
or
roar
,
or
whatever
it
be
,
when
they
be
past
.
  
<EOS>
the
music
of
their
voice
be
very
far
from
be
pleasant
to
us
,
and
sometimes
would
be
so
very
disturbing
that
we
could
not
sleep
for
it
;
and
often
our
sentinel
would
call
us
that
be
awake
to
come
and
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
windy
,
tempestuous
night
,
after
a
rainy
day
,
that
we
be
indeed
call
up
;
for
such
innumerable
number
of
devilish
creature
come
about
us
that
our
watch
really
think
they
would
attack
us
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
come
on
the
side
where
the
fire
be
;
and
though
we
think
ourselves
secure
everywhere
else
,
yet
we
all
get
up
and
take
to
our
arm
.
<EOS>
the
moon
be
near
the
full
,
but
the
air
full
of
fly
cloud
,
and
a
strange
hurricane
of
wind
to
add
to
the
terror
of
the
night
;
when
,
look
on
the
back
part
of
our
camp
,
I
think
I
see
a
creature
within
our
fortification
,
and
so
indeed
he
be
,
except
his
haunch
,
for
he
have
take
a
run
leap
,
I
suppose
,
and
with
all
his
might
have
throw
himself
clear
over
our
palisade
,
except
one
strong
pile
,
which
stand
high
than
the
rest
,
and
which
have
catch
hold
of
him
,
and
by
his
weight
he
have
hang
himself
upon
it
,
the
spike
of
the
pile
run
into
his
hinder
haunch
or
thigh
,
on
the
inside
;
and
by
that
he
hang
,
growl
and
bite
the
wood
for
rage
.
<EOS>
I
snatch
up
a
lance
from
one
of
the
negro
that
stand
just
by
me
,
and
run
to
him
,
strike
it
three
or
four
time
into
him
,
and
despatch
him
,
be
unwilling
to
shoot
,
because
I
have
a
mind
to
have
a
volley
fire
among
the
rest
,
whom
I
could
see
stand
without
,
as
thick
as
a
drove
of
bullock
go
to
a
fair
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
call
our
people
out
,
and
show
them
the
object
of
terror
which
I
have
see
,
and
,
without
any
further
consultation
,
fire
a
full
volley
among
them
,
most
of
our
piece
be
load
with
two
or
three
slug
or
bullet
apiece
.
<EOS>
It
make
a
horrible
clutter
among
them
,
and
in
general
they
all
take
to
their
heel
,
only
that
we
could
observe
that
some
walk
off
with
more
gravity
and
majesty
than
other
,
be
not
so
much
fright
at
the
noise
and
fire
;
and
we
could
perceive
that
some
be
leave
upon
the
ground
struggle
as
for
life
,
but
we
durst
not
stir
out
to
see
what
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
they
stand
so
thick
,
and
be
so
near
us
,
that
we
could
not
well
miss
kill
or
wound
some
of
them
,
and
we
believe
they
have
certainly
the
smell
of
us
,
and
our
victual
we
have
be
kill
;
for
we
have
kill
a
deer
,
and
three
or
four
of
those
creature
like
goat
the
day
before
;
and
some
of
the
offal
have
be
throw
out
behind
our
camp
,
and
this
,
we
suppose
,
draw
them
so
much
about
us
;
but
we
avoid
it
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
creature
flee
,
yet
we
hear
a
frightful
roar
all
night
at
the
place
where
they
stand
,
which
we
suppose
be
from
some
that
be
wound
,
and
as
soon
as
day
come
we
go
out
to
see
what
execution
we
have
do
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
it
be
a
strange
sight
;
there
be
three
tiger
and
two
wolf
quite
kill
,
besides
the
creature
I
have
kill
within
our
palisade
,
which
seem
to
be
of
an
ill
-
gendere
kind
,
between
a
tiger
and
a
leopard
.
<EOS>
besides
this
there
be
a
noble
old
lion
alive
,
but
with
both
his
fore
-
leg
break
,
so
that
he
could
not
stir
away
,
and
he
have
almost
beat
himself
to
death
with
struggle
all
night
,
and
we
find
that
this
be
the
wounded
soldier
that
have
roar
so
loud
and
give
us
so
much
disturbance
.
<EOS>
Our
surgeon
,
look
at
him
,
smile
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
I
could
be
sure
this
lion
would
be
as
grateful
to
me
as
one
of
his
majesty
's
ancestor
be
to
Androcles
,
the
roman
slave
,
I
would
certainly
set
both
his
leg
again
and
cure
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
hear
the
story
of
Androcles
,
so
he
tell
it
me
at
large
;
but
as
to
the
surgeon
,
we
tell
him
he
have
no
way
to
know
whether
the
lion
would
do
so
or
not
,
but
to
cure
him
first
and
trust
to
his
honour
;
but
he
have
no
faith
,
so
to
despatch
him
and
put
him
out
of
his
torment
,
he
shoot
him
in
the
head
and
kill
him
,
for
which
we
call
him
the
king
-
killer
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
Our
negro
find
no
less
than
five
of
these
ravenous
creature
wound
and
drop
at
a
distance
from
our
quarter
;
whereof
,
one
be
a
wolf
,
one
a
fine
spot
young
leopard
,
and
the
other
be
creature
that
we
know
not
what
to
call
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
several
more
of
these
gentlefolk
about
after
that
,
but
no
such
general
rendezvous
of
them
as
that
be
any
more
;
but
this
ill
effect
it
have
to
us
,
that
it
fright
the
deer
and
other
creature
from
our
neighbourhood
,
of
whose
company
we
be
much
more
desirous
,
and
which
be
necessary
for
our
subsistence
.
<EOS>
however
,
our
negro
go
out
every
day
a
-
hunting
,
as
they
call
it
,
with
bow
and
arrow
,
and
they
scarce
ever
fail
of
bring
us
home
something
or
other
;
and
particularly
we
find
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
after
the
rain
have
fall
some
time
,
abundance
of
wild
fowl
,
such
as
we
have
in
England
,
duck
,
teal
,
widgeon
,
etc
.
;
some
geese
,
and
some
kind
that
we
have
never
see
before
;
and
we
frequently
kill
them
.
<EOS>
also
we
catch
a
great
deal
of
fresh
fish
out
of
the
river
,
so
that
we
want
no
provision
.
<EOS>
if
we
want
anything
,
it
be
salt
to
eat
with
our
fresh
meat
;
but
we
have
a
little
left
,
and
we
use
it
sparingly
;
for
as
to
our
negro
,
they
could
not
taste
it
,
nor
do
they
care
to
eat
any
meat
that
be
season
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
weather
begin
now
to
clear
up
,
the
rain
be
down
,
and
the
flood
abate
,
and
the
sun
,
which
have
pass
our
zenith
,
be
go
to
the
southward
a
good
way
;
so
we
prepare
to
go
on
our
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
12th
of
October
,
or
thereabout
,
that
we
begin
to
set
forward
;
and
have
an
easy
country
to
travel
in
,
as
well
as
to
supply
us
with
provision
,
though
still
without
inhabitant
,
we
make
more
despatch
,
travel
sometimes
,
as
we
calculate
it
,
twenty
or
twenty
-
five
mile
a
day
;
nor
do
we
halt
anywhere
in
eleven
day
'
march
,
one
day
except
,
which
be
to
make
a
raft
to
carry
us
over
a
small
river
,
which
,
have
swell
with
the
rain
,
be
not
yet
quite
down
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
past
this
river
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
run
to
the
northward
too
,
we
find
a
great
row
of
hill
in
our
way
.
<EOS>
We
see
,
indeed
,
the
country
open
to
the
right
at
a
great
distance
;
but
,
as
we
keep
true
to
our
course
,
due
west
,
we
be
not
willing
to
go
a
great
way
out
of
our
way
,
only
to
shun
a
,
few
hill
.
<EOS>
so
we
advance
;
but
we
be
surprised
when
,
be
not
quite
come
to
the
top
,
one
of
our
company
,
who
,
with
two
negro
,
be
get
up
before
us
,
cry
out
,
"
the
sea
!
<EOS>
the
sea
!
"
<EOS>
and
fall
a
-
dancing
and
jumping
,
as
sign
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
the
gunner
and
I
be
most
surprised
at
it
,
because
we
have
but
that
morning
be
calculate
that
we
must
have
yet
above
1000
mile
on
the
sea
side
,
and
that
we
could
not
expect
to
reach
it
till
another
rainy
season
would
be
upon
us
;
so
that
when
our
man
cry
out
,
"
the
sea
,
"
the
gunner
be
angry
,
and
say
he
be
mad
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
be
both
in
the
great
surprise
imaginable
,
when
,
come
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
though
it
be
very
high
,
we
see
nothing
but
water
,
either
before
us
or
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
,
be
a
vast
sea
,
without
any
bound
but
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
down
the
hill
full
of
confusion
of
thought
,
not
be
able
to
conceive
whereabout
<EOS>
we
be
or
what
it
must
be
,
see
by
all
our
chart
the
sea
be
yet
a
vast
way
off
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
above
three
mile
from
the
hill
before
we
come
to
the
shore
,
or
water
-
edge
of
this
sea
,
and
there
,
to
our
further
surprise
,
we
find
the
water
fresh
and
pleasant
to
drink
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
we
know
not
what
course
to
take
.
<EOS>
the
sea
,
as
we
think
it
to
be
,
put
a
full
stop
to
our
journey
(
I
mean
westward
)
,
for
it
lie
just
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
Our
next
question
be
,
which
hand
to
turn
to
,
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
,
but
this
be
soon
resolve
;
for
,
as
we
know
not
the
extent
of
it
,
we
consider
that
our
way
,
if
it
have
be
the
sea
really
,
must
be
on
the
north
,
and
therefore
,
if
we
go
to
the
south
now
,
it
must
be
just
so
much
out
of
our
way
at
last
.
<EOS>
so
,
have
spend
a
good
part
of
the
day
in
our
surprise
at
the
thing
,
and
consult
what
to
do
,
we
set
forward
to
the
north
.
  
<EOS>
We
travel
upon
the
shore
of
this
sea
full
twenty
-
three
day
before
we
could
come
to
any
resolution
about
what
it
be
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
early
one
morning
,
one
of
our
seaman
cry
out
,
"
land
!
"
<EOS>
and
it
be
no
false
alarm
,
for
we
see
plainly
the
top
of
some
hill
at
a
very
great
distance
,
on
the
further
side
of
the
water
,
due
west
;
but
though
this
satisfy
us
that
it
be
not
the
ocean
,
but
an
inland
sea
or
lake
,
yet
we
see
no
land
to
the
northward
,
that
be
to
say
,
no
end
of
it
,
but
be
oblige
to
travel
eight
day
more
,
and
near
100
mile
farther
,
before
we
come
to
the
end
of
it
,
and
then
we
find
this
lake
or
sea
end
in
a
very
great
river
which
run
N.
or
N.
by
E.
,
as
the
other
river
have
do
which
I
mention
before
.
  
<EOS>
My
friend
the
gunner
,
upon
examine
,
say
that
he
believe
that
he
be
mistaken
before
,
and
that
this
be
the
river
Nile
,
but
be
still
of
the
mind
that
we
be
of
before
,
that
we
should
not
think
of
a
voyage
into
Egypt
that
way
;
so
we
resolve
upon
cross
this
river
,
which
,
however
,
be
not
so
easy
as
before
,
the
river
be
very
rapid
and
the
channel
very
broad
.
  
<EOS>
It
cost
us
,
therefore
,
a
week
here
to
get
material
to
waft
ourselves
and
cattle
over
this
river
;
for
though
here
be
store
of
tree
,
yet
there
be
none
of
any
considerable
growth
sufficient
to
make
a
canoe
.
  
<EOS>
during
our
march
on
the
edge
of
this
bank
we
meet
with
great
fatigue
,
and
therefore
travel
a
few
mile
in
a
day
than
before
,
there
be
such
a
prodigious
number
of
little
river
that
come
down
from
the
hill
on
the
east
side
,
empty
themselves
into
this
gulf
,
all
which
water
be
pretty
high
,
the
rain
have
be
but
newly
over
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
last
three
day
of
our
travel
we
meet
with
some
inhabitant
,
but
we
find
they
live
upon
the
little
hill
and
not
by
the
water
-
side
;
nor
be
we
a
little
put
to
it
for
food
in
this
march
,
have
kill
nothing
for
four
or
five
day
but
some
fish
we
catch
out
of
the
lake
,
and
that
not
in
such
plenty
as
we
find
before
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
to
make
us
some
amend
,
we
have
no
disturbance
upon
all
the
shore
of
this
lake
from
any
wild
beast
;
the
only
inconveniency
of
that
kind
be
,
that
we
meet
an
ugly
,
venomous
,
deform
kind
of
a
snake
or
serpent
in
the
wet
ground
near
the
lake
,
that
several
time
pursue
us
as
if
it
would
attack
us
;
and
if
we
strike
or
throw
anything
at
it
,
it
would
raise
itself
up
and
hiss
so
loud
that
it
may
be
hear
a
great
way
.
<EOS>
It
have
a
hellish
ugly
deform
look
and
voice
,
and
our
man
would
not
be
persuade
but
it
be
the
devil
,
only
that
we
do
not
know
what
business
Satan
could
have
there
,
where
there
be
no
people
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
remarkable
that
we
have
now
travel
1000
mile
without
meet
with
any
people
in
the
heart
of
the
whole
continent
of
Africa
,
where
,
to
be
sure
,
never
man
set
his
foot
since
the
son
of
Noah
spread
themselves
over
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
.
<EOS>
here
also
our
gunner
take
an
observation
with
his
forestaff
,
to
determine
our
latitude
,
and
he
find
now
,
that
have
march
about
thirty
-
three
day
northward
,
we
be
in
6
degree
22
minute
south
latitude
.
  
<EOS>
after
have
with
great
difficulty
get
over
this
river
,
we
come
into
a
strange
wild
country
that
begin
a
little
to
affright
us
;
for
though
the
country
be
not
a
desert
of
dry
scald
sand
as
that
be
we
have
pass
before
,
yet
it
be
mountainous
,
barren
,
and
infinitely
full
of
most
furious
wild
beast
,
more
than
any
place
we
have
pass
yet
.
<EOS>
there
be
indeed
a
kind
of
coarse
herbage
on
the
surface
,
and
now
and
then
a
few
tree
,
or
rather
shrub
.
<EOS>
but
people
we
could
see
none
,
and
we
begin
to
be
in
great
suspense
about
victual
,
for
we
have
not
kill
a
deer
a
great
while
,
but
have
live
chiefly
upon
fish
and
fowl
,
always
by
the
water
-
side
,
both
which
seem
to
fail
us
now
;
and
we
be
in
the
more
consternation
,
because
we
could
not
lay
in
a
stock
here
to
proceed
upon
,
as
we
do
before
,
but
be
oblige
to
set
out
with
scarcity
,
and
without
any
certainty
of
a
supply
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
,
however
,
no
remedy
but
patience
;
and
have
kill
some
fowl
and
dry
some
fish
,
as
much
as
,
with
short
allowance
,
we
reckon
would
last
us
five
day
,
we
resolve
to
venture
,
and
venture
we
do
;
nor
be
it
without
cause
that
we
be
apprehensive
of
the
danger
,
for
we
travel
the
five
day
and
meet
neither
with
fish
nor
fowl
,
nor
four
-
footed
beast
,
whose
flesh
be
fit
to
eat
,
and
we
be
in
a
most
dreadful
apprehension
of
be
famish
to
death
.
<EOS>
on
the
sixth
day
we
almost
fast
,
or
,
as
we
may
say
,
we
eat
up
all
the
scrap
of
what
we
have
leave
,
and
at
night
lie
down
supperless
upon
our
mat
,
with
heavy
heart
,
be
oblige
the
eighth
day
to
kill
one
of
our
poor
faithful
servant
,
the
buffalo
that
carry
our
baggage
.
<EOS>
the
flesh
of
this
creature
be
very
good
,
and
so
sparingly
do
we
eat
of
it
that
it
last
us
all
three
day
and
a
half
,
and
be
just
spend
;
and
we
be
on
the
point
of
kill
another
when
we
see
before
us
a
country
that
promise
better
,
have
high
tree
and
a
large
river
in
the
middle
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
encourage
us
,
and
we
quicken
our
march
for
the
river
-
side
,
though
with
empty
stomach
,
and
very
faint
and
weak
;
but
before
we
come
to
this
river
we
have
the
good
hap
to
meet
with
some
young
deer
,
a
thing
we
have
long
wish
for
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
have
shoot
three
of
them
,
we
come
to
a
full
stop
to
fill
our
belly
,
and
never
give
the
flesh
time
to
cool
before
we
eat
it
;
nay
,
it
be
much
we
could
stay
to
kill
it
and
have
not
eat
it
alive
,
for
we
be
,
in
short
,
almost
famished
.
  
<EOS>
through
all
that
inhospitable
country
we
see
continually
lion
,
tiger
,
leopard
,
civet
cat
,
and
abundance
of
kind
of
creature
that
we
do
not
understand
;
we
see
no
elephant
,
but
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
we
meet
with
an
elephant
's
tooth
lie
on
the
ground
,
and
some
of
them
lie
,
as
it
be
,
half
bury
by
the
length
of
time
that
they
have
lain
there
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
shore
of
this
river
,
we
find
it
run
northerly
still
,
as
all
the
rest
have
do
,
but
with
this
difference
,
that
as
the
course
of
the
other
river
be
N.
by
E.
or
N.N.E.
,
the
course
of
this
lie
N.W.N.
  
<EOS>
on
the
farth
bank
of
this
river
we
see
some
sign
of
inhabitant
,
but
meet
with
none
for
the
first
day
;
but
the
next
day
we
come
into
an
inhabit
country
,
the
people
all
negro
,
and
stark
naked
,
without
shame
,
both
man
and
woman
.
  
<EOS>
We
make
sign
of
friendship
to
them
,
and
find
them
a
very
frank
,
civil
,
and
friendly
sort
of
people
.
<EOS>
They
come
to
our
negro
without
any
suspicion
,
nor
do
they
give
us
any
reason
to
suspect
them
of
any
villainy
,
as
the
other
have
do
;
we
make
sign
to
them
that
we
be
hungry
,
and
immediately
some
naked
woman
run
and
fetch
us
great
quantity
of
root
,
and
of
thing
like
pumpkin
,
which
we
make
no
scruple
to
eat
;
and
our
artificer
show
them
some
of
his
trinket
that
he
have
make
,
some
of
iron
,
some
of
silver
,
but
none
of
gold
.
<EOS>
They
have
so
much
judgment
as
to
choose
that
of
silver
before
the
iron
;
but
when
we
show
them
some
gold
,
we
find
they
do
not
value
it
so
much
as
either
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
for
some
of
these
thing
they
bring
us
more
provision
,
and
three
living
creature
as
big
as
calf
,
but
not
of
that
kind
;
neither
do
we
ever
see
any
of
them
before
;
their
flesh
be
very
good
;
and
after
that
they
bring
us
twelve
more
,
and
some
small
creature
like
hare
;
all
which
be
very
welcome
to
us
,
who
be
indeed
at
a
very
great
loss
for
provision
.
  
<EOS>
We
grow
very
intimate
with
these
people
,
and
indeed
they
be
the
civill
and
most
friendly
people
that
we
meet
with
at
all
,
and
mightily
pleased
with
us
;
and
,
which
be
very
particular
,
they
be
much
easy
to
be
make
to
understand
our
meaning
than
any
we
have
meet
with
before
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
we
begin
to
inquire
our
way
,
point
to
the
west
.
<EOS>
They
make
us
understand
easily
that
we
could
not
go
that
way
,
but
they
point
to
us
that
we
may
go
north
-
west
,
so
that
we
presently
understand
that
there
be
another
lake
in
our
way
,
which
prove
to
be
true
;
for
in
two
day
more
we
see
it
plain
,
and
it
hold
us
till
we
pass
the
equinoctial
line
,
lie
all
the
way
on
our
left
hand
,
though
at
a
great
distance
.
  
<EOS>
travel
thus
northward
,
our
gunner
seem
very
anxious
about
our
proceeding
;
for
he
assure
us
,
and
make
me
sensible
of
it
by
the
map
which
he
have
be
teach
me
out
of
,
that
when
we
come
into
the
latitude
of
six
degree
,
or
thereabout
,
north
of
the
line
,
the
land
trend
away
to
the
west
to
such
a
length
that
we
should
not
come
at
the
sea
under
a
march
of
above
1500
mile
farther
westward
than
the
country
we
desire
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
there
be
no
navigable
river
that
we
may
meet
with
,
which
,
run
into
the
west
ocean
,
may
perhaps
carry
us
down
their
stream
,
and
then
,
if
it
be
1500
mile
,
or
twice
1500
mile
,
we
may
do
well
enough
if
we
could
but
get
provision
.
  
<EOS>
here
he
show
me
the
map
again
,
and
that
there
appear
no
river
whose
stream
be
of
any
such
a
length
as
to
do
any
kindness
,
till
we
come
perhaps
within
200
or
300
mile
of
the
shore
,
except
the
Rio
Grande
,
as
they
call
it
,
which
lie
farther
northward
from
us
,
at
least
700
mile
;
and
that
then
he
know
not
what
kind
of
country
it
may
carry
us
through
;
for
he
say
it
be
his
opinion
that
the
heat
on
the
north
of
the
line
,
even
in
the
same
latitude
,
be
violent
,
and
the
country
more
desolate
,
barren
,
and
barbarous
,
than
those
of
the
south
;
and
that
when
we
come
among
the
negro
in
the
north
part
of
Africa
,
next
the
sea
,
especially
those
who
have
see
and
traffic
with
the
Europeans
,
such
as
Dutch
,
English
,
Portuguese
,
Spaniards
,
etc
.
,
they
have
most
of
them
be
so
ill
-
use
at
some
time
or
other
that
they
would
certainly
put
all
the
spite
they
could
upon
us
in
mere
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
consideration
he
advise
us
that
,
as
soon
as
we
have
pass
this
lake
,
we
should
proceed
W.S.W.
,
that
be
to
say
,
a
little
incline
to
the
south
,
and
that
in
time
we
should
meet
with
the
great
river
Congo
,
from
whence
the
coast
be
call
Congo
,
be
a
little
north
of
Angola
,
where
we
intend
at
first
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
ever
he
have
be
on
the
coast
of
Congo
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
yes
,
he
have
,
but
be
never
on
shore
there
.
<EOS>
then
I
ask
him
how
we
should
get
from
thence
to
the
coast
where
the
european
ship
come
,
see
,
<EOS>
if
the
land
trend
away
west
for
1500
mile
,
we
must
have
all
that
shore
to
traverse
before
we
could
double
the
west
point
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
it
be
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
we
should
hear
of
some
european
ship
to
take
us
in
,
for
that
they
often
visit
the
coast
of
Congo
and
Angola
,
in
trade
with
the
negro
;
and
that
if
we
could
not
,
yet
,
if
we
could
but
find
provision
,
we
should
make
our
way
as
well
along
the
sea
-
shore
as
along
the
river
,
till
we
come
to
the
Gold
Coast
,
which
,
he
say
,
be
not
above
400
or
500
mile
north
of
Congo
,
besides
the
turning
of
the
coast
west
about
300
more
;
that
shore
be
in
the
latitude
of
six
or
seven
degree
;
and
that
there
the
English
,
or
dutch
,
or
French
have
settlement
or
factory
,
perhaps
all
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
more
mind
,
all
the
while
he
argue
,
to
have
go
northward
,
and
ship
ourselves
in
the
Rio
Grande
,
or
,
as
the
trader
call
it
,
the
river
Negro
or
Niger
,
for
I
know
that
at
last
it
would
bring
us
down
to
the
Cape
de
Verd
,
where
we
be
sure
of
relief
;
whereas
,
at
the
coast
we
be
go
to
now
,
we
have
a
prodigious
way
still
to
go
,
either
by
sea
or
land
,
and
no
certainty
which
way
to
get
provision
but
by
force
;
but
for
the
present
I
hold
my
tongue
,
because
it
be
my
tutor
's
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
,
accord
to
his
desire
,
we
come
to
turn
southward
,
have
pass
beyond
the
second
great
lake
,
our
man
begin
all
to
be
uneasy
,
and
say
we
be
now
out
of
our
way
for
certain
,
for
that
we
be
go
farther
from
home
,
and
that
we
be
indeed
far
enough
off
already
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
have
not
march
above
twelve
day
more
,
eight
whereof
be
take
up
in
round
the
lake
,
and
four
more
south
-
west
,
in
order
to
make
for
the
river
Congo
,
but
we
be
put
to
another
full
stop
,
by
enter
a
country
<EOS>
so
desolate
,
so
frightful
,
and
so
wild
,
that
we
know
not
what
to
think
or
do
;
for
,
besides
that
it
appear
as
a
terrible
and
boundless
desert
,
have
neither
wood
,
tree
,
river
,
or
inhabitant
,
so
even
the
place
where
we
be
be
desolate
of
inhabitant
,
nor
have
we
any
way
to
gather
in
a
stock
of
provision
for
the
passing
of
this
desert
,
as
we
do
before
at
our
enter
the
first
,
unless
we
have
march
back
four
day
to
the
place
where
we
turn
the
head
of
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
notwithstanding
this
,
we
venture
;
for
,
to
man
that
have
pass
such
wild
place
as
we
have
do
,
nothing
could
seem
too
desperate
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
We
venture
,
I
say
,
and
the
rather
because
we
see
very
high
mountain
in
our
way
at
a
great
distance
,
and
we
imagine
,
wherever
there
be
mountain
there
would
be
spring
and
river
;
where
river
there
would
be
tree
and
grass
;
where
tree
and
grass
there
would
be
cattle
;
and
where
cattle
,
some
kind
of
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
in
consequence
of
this
speculative
philosophy
,
we
enter
this
waste
,
have
a
great
heap
of
root
and
plant
for
our
bread
,
such
as
the
Indians
give
us
,
a
very
little
flesh
or
salt
,
and
but
a
little
water
.
  
<EOS>
We
travel
two
day
towards
those
hill
,
and
still
they
seem
as
far
off
as
they
do
at
first
,
and
it
be
the
fifth
day
before
we
get
to
them
;
indeed
,
we
travel
but
<EOS>
softly
,
for
it
be
excessively
hot
;
and
we
be
much
about
the
very
equinoctial
line
,
we
hardly
know
whether
to
the
south
or
the
north
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
have
conclude
,
that
where
there
be
hill
there
would
be
spring
,
so
it
happen
;
but
we
be
not
only
surprised
,
but
really
fright
,
to
find
the
first
spring
we
come
to
,
and
which
look
admirably
clear
and
beautiful
,
to
be
salt
as
brine
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
terrible
disappointment
to
us
,
and
put
us
under
melancholy
apprehension
at
first
;
but
the
gunner
,
who
be
of
a
spirit
never
discourage
,
tell
us
we
should
not
be
disturb
at
that
,
but
be
very
thankful
,
for
salt
be
a
bait
we
stand
in
as
much
need
of
as
anything
,
and
there
be
no
question
<EOS>
but
we
should
find
fresh
water
as
well
as
salt
;
and
here
our
surgeon
step
in
to
encourage
us
,
and
tell
us
that
if
we
do
not
know
he
would
show
us
a
way
how
to
make
that
salt
water
fresh
,
which
indeed
make
us
all
more
cheerful
,
though
we
wonder
what
he
mean
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
our
man
,
without
bidding
,
have
be
seek
about
for
other
spring
,
and
find
several
;
but
still
they
be
all
salt
;
<EOS>
from
whence
we
conclude
that
there
be
a
salt
rock
or
mineral
stone
in
those
mountain
,
and
perhaps
they
may
be
all
of
such
a
substance
;
but
still
I
wonder
by
what
witchcraft
it
be
that
our
artist
the
surgeon
would
make
this
salt
water
turn
fresh
,
and
I
long
to
see
the
experiment
,
which
be
indeed
a
very
odd
one
;
but
he
go
to
work
with
as
much
assurance
as
if
he
have
try
it
on
the
very
spot
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
two
of
our
large
mat
and
sew
them
together
,
and
they
make
a
kind
of
a
bag
four
foot
broad
,
three
foot
and
a
half
high
,
and
about
a
foot
and
a
half
thick
when
it
be
full
.
  
<EOS>
He
cause
us
to
fill
this
bag
with
dry
sand
and
tread
it
down
as
close
as
we
could
,
not
to
burst
the
mat
.
<EOS>
when
thus
the
bag
be
full
within
a
foot
,
he
seek
some
other
earth
and
fill
up
the
rest
with
it
,
and
still
tread
all
in
as
hard
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
,
he
make
a
hole
in
the
upper
earth
about
as
broad
as
the
crown
of
a
large
hat
,
or
something
big
about
,
but
not
so
deep
,
and
bade
<EOS>
a
negro
fill
it
with
water
,
and
still
as
it
shrink
away
to
fill
it
again
,
and
keep
it
full
.
<EOS>
the
bag
he
have
place
at
first
across
two
piece
of
wood
,
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
;
and
under
it
he
order
some
of
our
skin
to
be
spread
that
would
hold
water
.
<EOS>
in
about
an
hour
,
and
not
sooner
,
the
water
begin
to
come
drop
through
the
bottom
of
the
bag
,
and
,
to
our
great
surprise
,
be
perfectly
fresh
and
sweet
,
and
this
continue
for
several
hour
;
but
in
the
end
the
water
begin
to
be
a
little
brackish
.
<EOS>
when
we
tell
him
that
,
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
turn
the
sand
out
,
and
fill
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
whether
he
do
this
by
way
of
experiment
from
his
own
fancy
,
or
whether
he
have
see
it
do
before
,
I
do
not
remember
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
we
mount
the
top
of
the
hill
,
where
the
prospect
be
indeed
astonish
,
for
as
far
as
the
eye
could
look
,
south
,
or
west
,
or
northwest
,
there
be
nothing
to
be
see
but
a
vast
howling
wilderness
,
with
neither
tree
nor
river
,
nor
any
green
thing
.
<EOS>
the
surface
we
find
,
as
the
part
we
pass
the
day
before
,
have
a
kind
of
thick
moss
upon
it
,
of
a
blackish
dead
colour
,
but
nothing
in
it
that
look
like
food
,
either
for
man
or
beast
.
  
<EOS>
have
we
be
store
with
provision
to
have
enter
for
ten
or
twenty
day
upon
this
wilderness
,
as
we
be
formerly
,
and
with
fresh
water
,
we
have
heart
good
enough
to
have
venture
,
though
we
have
be
oblige
to
come
back
again
,
for
if
we
go
north
<EOS>
we
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
we
may
meet
with
the
same
;
but
we
neither
have
provision
,
neither
be
we
in
any
place
where
it
be
possible
to
get
them
.
<EOS>
We
kill
some
wild
ferine
creature
at
the
foot
of
these
hill
;
but
,
except
two
thing
,
like
to
nothing
that
we
ever
see
before
,
we
meet
with
nothing
that
be
fit
to
eat
.
<EOS>
these
be
creature
that
seem
to
be
between
the
kind
of
a
buffalo
and
a
deer
,
but
indeed
resemble
neither
;
for
they
have
no
horn
,
and
have
great
leg
like
a
cow
,
with
a
fine
head
,
and
the
neck
like
a
deer
.
<EOS>
We
kill
also
,
at
several
time
,
a
tiger
,
two
young
lion
,
and
a
wolf
;
but
,
God
be
thank
,
we
be
not
so
reduce
as
to
eat
carrion
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
terrible
prospect
I
renew
my
motion
of
turn
northward
,
and
make
towards
the
river
Niger
or
Rio
Grande
,
then
to
turn
west
towards
the
english
settlement
on
the
Gold
Coast
;
to
which
every
one
most
readily
consent
,
only
our
gunner
,
who
be
indeed
our
good
guide
,
though
he
happen
to
be
mistake
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
He
move
that
,
as
our
coast
be
now
northward
,
so
we
may
slant
away
north
-
west
,
that
so
,
by
cross
the
country
,
we
may
perhaps
meet
with
some
other
river
that
run
into
the
Rio
Grande
northward
,
or
down
to
the
Gold
Coast
southward
,
and
so
both
direct
our
way
and
shorten
the
labour
;
as
also
because
,
if
any
of
the
country
be
inhabit
and
fruitful
,
we
should
probably
find
it
upon
the
shore
of
the
river
,
where
alone
we
could
be
furnish
with
provision
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
good
advice
,
and
too
rational
not
to
be
take
;
but
our
present
business
be
,
what
to
do
to
get
out
of
this
dreadful
place
we
be
in
.
<EOS>
behind
us
be
a
waste
,
which
have
already
cost
us
five
day
'
march
,
and
we
have
not
provision
for
five
day
leave
to
go
back
again
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
before
us
be
nothing
but
horror
,
as
above
;
so
we
resolve
,
see
the
ridge
of
the
hill
we
be
upon
have
some
appearance
of
fruitfulness
,
and
that
they
seem
to
lead
away
to
the
northward
a
great
way
,
to
keep
under
the
foot
of
them
on
the
east
side
,
to
go
on
as
far
as
we
could
,
and
in
the
meantime
to
look
diligently
out
for
food
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
we
move
on
the
next
morning
;
for
we
have
no
time
to
lose
,
and
,
to
our
great
comfort
,
we
come
in
our
first
morning
's
march
to
very
good
spring
of
fresh
water
;
and
lest
we
should
have
a
scarcity
again
,
we
fill
all
our
bladder
bottle
and
carry
it
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
should
also
have
observe
that
our
surgeon
,
who
make
the
salt
water
fresh
,
take
the
opportunity
of
those
salt
spring
,
and
make
us
the
quantity
of
three
or
four
peck
of
very
good
salt
.
  
<EOS>
in
our
third
march
we
find
an
unexpected
supply
of
food
,
the
hill
be
full
of
hare
.
<EOS>
They
be
of
a
kind
something
different
from
our
in
England
,
large
and
not
as
swift
of
foot
,
but
very
good
meat
.
<EOS>
We
shoot
several
of
them
,
and
the
little
tame
leopard
,
which
I
tell
you
we
take
at
the
negro
town
that
we
plunder
,
hunt
them
like
a
dog
,
and
kill
us
several
every
day
;
but
she
would
eat
nothing
of
them
unless
we
give
it
her
,
which
,
indeed
,
in
our
circumstance
,
be
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
We
salt
them
a
little
and
dry
them
in
the
sun
whole
,
and
carry
a
strange
parcel
along
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
almost
three
hundred
,
for
we
do
not
know
when
we
may
find
any
more
,
either
of
these
or
any
other
food
.
<EOS>
We
continue
our
course
under
these
hill
very
comfortably
for
eight
or
nine
day
,
when
we
find
,
to
our
great
satisfaction
,
the
country
beyond
us
begin
to
look
with
something
of
a
well
countenance
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
west
side
of
the
hill
,
we
never
examine
it
till
this
day
,
when
three
of
our
company
,
the
rest
halt
for
refreshment
,
mount
the
hill
again
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
,
but
find
it
all
the
same
,
nor
could
they
see
any
end
of
it
,
no
,
not
to
the
north
,
the
way
we
be
go
;
so
the
tenth
day
,
find
the
hill
make
a
turn
,
and
lead
as
it
be
into
the
vast
desert
,
we
leave
them
and
continue
our
course
north
,
the
country
be
very
tolerably
full
of
wood
,
some
waste
,
but
not
tediously
long
,
till
we
come
,
by
our
gunner
's
observation
,
into
the
latitude
of
eight
degree
five
minute
,
which
we
be
nineteen
day
more
in
perform
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
way
we
find
no
inhabitant
,
but
abundance
of
wild
ravenous
creature
,
with
which
we
become
so
well
acquainted
now
that
really
we
do
not
much
mind
them
.
<EOS>
We
see
lion
and
tiger
and
leopard
every
night
and
morning
in
abundance
;
but
as
they
seldom
come
near
us
,
we
let
them
go
about
their
business
:
if
they
offer
to
come
near
us
,
we
make
false
fire
with
any
gun
that
be
uncharged
,
and
they
would
walk
off
as
soon
as
they
see
the
flash
.
  
<EOS>
We
make
pretty
good
shift
for
food
all
this
way
;
for
sometimes
we
kill
hare
,
sometimes
some
fowl
,
but
for
my
life
I
can
not
give
name
to
any
of
them
,
except
a
kind
of
partridge
,
and
another
that
be
like
our
turtle
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
we
begin
to
meet
with
elephant
again
in
great
number
;
those
creature
delight
chiefly
in
the
woody
part
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
this
long
-
continue
march
fatigue
us
very
much
,
and
two
of
our
man
fall
sick
,
indeed
,
so
very
sick
that
we
think
they
would
have
die
;
and
one
of
our
negro
die
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Our
surgeon
say
it
be
an
apoplexy
,
but
he
wonder
at
it
,
he
say
,
for
he
could
never
complain
of
his
high
feeding
.
<EOS>
another
of
them
be
very
ill
;
but
our
surgeon
with
much
ado
persuade
him
,
indeed
it
be
almost
force
him
to
be
let
blood
,
he
recover
.
  
<EOS>
We
halt
here
twelve
day
for
the
sake
of
our
sick
man
,
and
our
surgeon
persuade
me
and
three
or
four
more
of
us
to
be
let
blood
during
the
time
of
rest
,
which
,
with
other
thing
he
give
us
,
contribute
very
much
to
our
continued
health
in
so
tedious
a
march
and
in
so
hot
a
climate
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
march
we
pitch
our
mat
tent
every
night
,
and
they
be
very
comfortable
to
us
,
though
we
have
tree
and
wood
to
shelter
us
in
most
place
.
<EOS>
We
think
it
very
strange
that
in
all
this
part
of
the
country
we
yet
meet
with
no
inhabitant
;
but
the
principal
reason
,
as
we
find
afterwards
,
be
,
that
we
,
have
keep
a
western
course
first
,
and
then
a
northern
course
,
be
get
too
much
into
the
middle
of
the
country
and
among
the
desert
;
whereas
the
inhabitant
be
principally
find
among
the
river
,
lake
,
and
lowland
,
as
well
to
the
south
-
west
as
to
the
north
.
  
<EOS>
what
little
rivulet
we
find
here
be
so
empty
of
water
,
that
except
some
pit
,
and
little
more
than
ordinary
pool
,
there
be
scarcely
any
water
to
be
see
in
them
;
and
they
rather
show
that
during
the
rainy
month
they
have
a
channel
,
than
that
they
have
really
run
water
in
them
at
that
time
,
by
which
it
be
easy
for
us
to
judge
that
we
have
a
great
way
to
go
;
but
this
be
no
discouragement
so
long
as
we
have
but
provision
,
and
some
seasonable
shelter
from
the
violent
heat
,
which
indeed
I
think
be
much
great
now
than
when
the
sun
be
just
over
our
head
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
be
recover
,
we
set
forward
again
,
very
well
store
with
provision
,
and
water
sufficient
,
and
bend
our
course
a
little
to
the
westward
of
the
north
,
travel
in
hope
of
some
favourable
stream
which
may
bear
a
canoe
;
but
we
find
none
till
after
twenty
day
'
travel
,
include
eight
day
'
rest
;
for
our
man
be
weak
,
we
rest
very
often
,
especially
when
we
come
to
place
which
be
proper
for
our
purpose
,
where
we
find
cattle
,
fowl
,
or
anything
to
kill
for
our
food
.
<EOS>
in
those
twenty
day
'
march
we
advance
four
degree
to
the
northward
,
besides
some
meridian
distance
westward
,
and
we
meet
with
abundance
of
elephant
,
and
with
a
good
number
of
elephant
'
tooth
scatter
up
and
down
,
here
and
there
,
in
the
woody
ground
especially
,
some
of
which
be
very
large
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
no
booty
to
us
;
our
business
be
provision
,
and
a
good
passage
out
of
the
country
;
and
it
have
be
much
more
to
our
purpose
to
have
find
a
good
fat
deer
,
and
to
have
kill
it
for
our
food
,
than
a
hundred
ton
of
elephant
'
tooth
;
and
yet
,
as
you
shall
presently
hear
,
when
we
come
to
begin
our
passage
by
water
,
we
once
think
to
have
build
a
large
canoe
,
on
purpose
to
have
load
it
with
ivory
;
but
this
be
when
we
know
nothing
of
the
river
,
nor
know
anything
<EOS>
how
dangerous
and
how
difficult
a
passage
it
be
we
be
likely
to
have
in
them
,
nor
have
consider
the
weight
of
carriage
to
lug
them
to
the
river
where
we
may
embark
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
twenty
day
'
travel
,
as
above
,
in
the
latitude
of
three
degree
sixteen
minute
,
we
discover
in
a
valley
,
at
some
distance
from
us
,
a
pretty
tolerable
stream
,
which
we
think
deserve
the
name
of
a
river
,
and
which
run
its
course
N.N.W.
,
which
be
just
what
we
want
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
fix
our
thought
upon
our
passage
by
water
,
we
take
this
for
the
place
to
make
the
experiment
,
and
bend
our
march
directly
to
the
valley
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
small
thicket
of
tree
just
in
our
way
,
which
we
go
by
,
think
no
harm
,
when
on
a
sudden
one
of
our
negro
be
dangerously
wound
with
an
arrow
shot
into
his
back
,
slant
between
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
this
put
us
to
a
full
stop
;
and
three
of
our
man
,
with
two
negro
,
spread
the
wood
,
for
it
be
but
a
small
one
,
find
a
negro
with
a
bow
,
but
no
arrow
,
who
would
have
escape
,
but
our
man
that
discover
him
shoot
him
in
revenge
of
the
mischief
he
have
do
;
so
we
lose
the
opportunity
of
take
him
prisoner
,
which
,
if
we
have
do
,
and
send
him
home
with
good
usage
,
it
may
have
bring
other
to
us
in
a
friendly
manner
.
  
<EOS>
go
a
little
farther
,
we
come
to
five
negro
hut
or
house
,
build
after
a
different
manner
from
any
we
have
see
yet
;
and
at
the
door
of
one
of
them
lie
seven
elephant
'
tooth
,
pile
up
against
the
wall
or
side
of
the
hut
,
as
if
they
have
be
provide
against
a
market
.
<EOS>
here
be
no
man
,
but
seven
or
eight
woman
,
and
near
twenty
child
.
<EOS>
We
offer
them
no
incivility
of
any
kind
,
but
give
them
every
one
a
bit
of
silver
beat
out
thin
,
as
I
observe
before
,
and
cut
diamond
fashion
,
or
in
the
shape
of
a
bird
,
at
which
the
woman
be
overjoy
,
and
bring
out
to
us
several
sort
of
food
,
which
we
do
not
understand
,
be
cake
of
a
meal
make
of
root
,
which
they
bake
in
the
sun
,
and
which
eat
very
well
.
<EOS>
We
go
a
little
way
farther
and
pitch
our
camp
for
that
night
,
not
doubt
but
our
civility
to
the
woman
would
produce
some
good
effect
when
their
husband
may
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
next
morning
the
woman
,
with
eleven
man
,
five
young
boy
,
and
two
good
big
girl
,
come
to
our
camp
.
<EOS>
before
they
come
quite
to
us
,
the
woman
call
aloud
,
and
make
an
odd
scream
noise
to
bring
us
out
;
and
accordingly
we
come
out
,
when
two
of
the
woman
,
show
us
what
we
have
give
them
,
and
point
to
the
company
behind
,
make
such
sign
as
we
could
easily
understand
signified
friendship
.
<EOS>
when
the
man
advance
,
have
bow
and
arrow
,
they
lay
them
down
on
the
ground
,
scrape
and
throw
sand
over
their
head
,
and
turn
round
three
time
with
their
hand
lay
up
upon
the
top
of
their
head
.
<EOS>
this
,
it
seem
,
be
a
solemn
vow
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
upon
this
we
beckon
them
with
our
hand
to
come
nearer
;
then
they
send
the
boy
and
girl
to
us
first
,
which
,
it
seem
,
be
to
bring
us
more
cake
of
bread
and
some
green
herb
to
eat
,
which
we
receive
,
and
take
the
boy
up
and
kiss
them
,
and
the
little
girl
too
;
then
the
man
come
up
close
to
us
,
and
sit
them
down
on
the
ground
,
make
sign
that
we
should
sit
down
by
them
,
which
we
do
.
<EOS>
They
say
much
to
one
another
,
but
we
could
not
understand
them
,
nor
could
we
find
any
way
to
make
them
understand
us
,
much
less
whither
we
be
go
,
or
what
we
want
,
only
that
we
easily
make
them
understand
we
want
victual
;
whereupon
one
of
the
man
,
cast
his
eye
about
him
towards
a
rise
ground
that
be
about
half
a
mile
off
,
start
up
as
if
he
be
fright
,
fly
to
the
place
where
they
have
lay
down
their
bow
and
arrow
,
snatch
up
a
bow
and
two
arrow
,
and
run
like
a
racehorse
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
there
,
he
let
fly
both
his
arrow
,
and
come
back
again
to
us
with
the
same
speed
.
<EOS>
We
,
see
he
come
with
the
bow
,
but
without
the
arrow
,
be
the
more
inquisitive
;
but
the
fellow
,
say
nothing
to
us
,
beckon
to
one
of
our
negro
to
come
to
him
,
and
we
bid
him
go
;
so
he
lead
him
back
to
the
place
,
<EOS>
where
lie
a
kind
of
deer
,
shoot
with
two
arrow
,
but
not
quite
dead
,
and
<EOS>
between
them
they
bring
it
down
to
us
.
<EOS>
this
be
for
a
gift
to
us
,
and
be
very
welcome
,
I
assure
you
,
for
our
stock
be
low
.
<EOS>
these
people
be
all
stark
naked
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
there
come
about
a
hundred
man
to
us
,
and
woman
make
the
same
awkward
signal
of
friendship
,
and
dancing
,
and
show
themselves
very
well
pleased
,
and
anything
they
have
they
give
us
.
<EOS>
how
the
man
in
the
wood
come
to
be
so
butcherly
and
rude
as
to
shoot
at
our
man
,
without
make
any
breach
first
,
we
could
not
imagine
;
for
the
people
be
simple
,
plain
,
and
inoffensive
in
all
our
other
conversation
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
from
hence
we
go
down
the
bank
of
the
little
river
I
mention
,
and
where
,
I
find
,
we
should
see
the
whole
nation
of
negro
,
but
whether
friendly
to
us
or
not
,
that
we
could
make
no
judgment
of
yet
.
  
<EOS>
the
river
be
no
use
to
us
,
as
to
the
design
of
make
canoe
,
a
great
while
;
and
we
traverse
the
country
on
the
edge
of
it
about
five
day
more
,
when
our
carpenter
,
find
the
stream
increase
,
propose
to
pitch
our
tent
,
and
fall
to
work
to
make
canoe
;
but
after
we
have
begin
the
work
,
and
cut
down
two
or
three
tree
,
and
spend
five
day
in
the
labour
,
some
of
our
man
,
wander
further
down
the
river
,
bring
us
word
that
the
stream
rather
decrease
than
increase
,
sink
away
into
the
sand
,
or
dry
up
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
,
so
that
the
river
appear
not
able
to
carry
the
least
canoe
that
could
be
any
way
useful
to
us
;
so
we
be
oblige
to
give
over
our
enterprise
and
move
on
.
  
<EOS>
in
our
further
prospect
this
way
,
we
march
three
day
full
west
,
the
country
on
the
north
side
be
extraordinary
mountainous
,
and
more
parched
and
dry
than
any
we
have
see
yet
;
whereas
,
in
the
part
which
look
due
west
,
we
find
a
pleasant
valley
run
a
great
way
between
two
great
ridge
of
mountain
.
<EOS>
the
hill
look
frightful
,
be
entirely
bare
of
tree
or
grass
,
and
even
white
with
the
dryness
of
the
sand
;
but
in
the
valley
we
have
tree
,
grass
,
and
some
creature
that
be
fit
for
food
,
and
some
inhabitant
.
  
<EOS>
We
pass
by
some
of
their
hut
or
house
,
and
see
people
about
them
,
but
they
run
up
into
the
hill
as
soon
as
they
see
us
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
this
valley
we
meet
with
a
people
country
,
and
at
first
it
put
us
to
some
doubt
whether
we
should
go
among
them
,
or
keep
up
towards
the
hill
northerly
;
and
as
our
aim
be
principally
as
before
,
to
make
our
way
to
the
river
Niger
,
we
incline
to
the
latter
,
pursue
our
course
by
the
compass
to
the
N.W.
<EOS>
We
march
thus
without
interruption
seven
day
more
,
when
we
meet
with
a
surprising
circumstance
much
more
desolate
and
disconsolate
than
our
own
,
and
which
,
in
time
to
come
,
will
scarce
seem
credible
.
  
<EOS>
We
do
not
much
seek
the
conversing
,
or
acquaint
ourselves
with
the
native
of
the
country
,
except
where
we
find
the
want
of
them
for
our
provision
,
or
their
direction
for
our
way
;
so
that
,
whereas
we
find
the
country
here
begin
to
be
very
populous
,
especially
towards
our
left
hand
,
that
is
,
to
the
south
,
we
keep
at
the
more
distance
northerly
,
still
stretch
towards
the
west
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
tract
we
find
something
or
other
to
kill
and
eat
,
which
always
supply
our
necessity
,
though
not
so
well
as
we
be
provide
in
our
first
set
out
;
be
thus
,
as
it
be
,
push
to
avoid
a
peopled
country
,
we
at
last
come
to
a
very
pleasant
,
agreeable
stream
of
water
,
not
big
enough
to
be
call
a
river
,
but
run
to
the
N.N.W.
,
which
be
the
very
course
we
desire
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
farth
bank
of
this
brook
,
we
perceive
some
hut
of
negro
,
not
many
,
and
in
a
little
low
spot
of
ground
,
some
maize
,
or
indian
corn
,
growing
,
which
intimate
presently
to
us
,
that
there
be
some
inhabitant
on
that
side
less
barbarous
than
what
we
have
meet
with
in
other
place
where
we
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
go
forward
,
our
whole
caravan
be
in
a
body
,
our
negro
,
who
be
in
the
front
,
cry
out
,
that
they
see
a
white
man
!
<EOS>
We
be
not
much
surprised
at
first
,
it
be
,
as
we
think
,
a
mistake
of
the
fellow
,
and
ask
them
what
they
mean
;
when
one
of
them
step
to
me
,
and
point
to
a
hut
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
,
I
be
astonish
to
see
a
white
man
indeed
,
but
stark
naked
,
very
busy
near
the
door
of
his
hut
,
and
stoop
down
to
the
ground
with
something
in
his
hand
,
as
if
he
have
be
at
some
work
;
and
his
back
be
towards
us
,
he
do
not
see
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
notice
to
our
negro
to
make
no
noise
,
and
wait
till
some
more
of
our
man
be
come
up
,
to
show
the
sight
to
them
,
that
they
may
be
sure
I
be
not
mistaken
;
and
we
be
soon
satisfied
of
the
truth
,
for
the
man
,
have
hear
some
noise
,
start
up
,
and
look
full
at
us
,
as
much
surprised
,
to
be
sure
,
as
we
be
,
but
whether
with
fear
or
hope
,
we
then
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
discover
us
,
so
do
the
rest
of
the
inhabitant
belong
to
the
hut
about
him
,
and
all
crowd
together
,
look
at
us
at
a
distance
,
a
little
bottom
,
in
which
the
brook
run
,
lie
between
us
;
the
white
man
,
and
all
the
rest
,
as
he
tell
us
afterwards
,
not
know
well
whether
they
should
stay
or
run
away
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
presently
come
into
my
thought
,
that
if
there
be
white
man
among
them
,
it
would
be
much
easy
to
make
them
understand
what
we
mean
as
to
peace
or
war
,
than
we
find
it
with
other
;
so
tie
a
piece
of
white
rag
to
the
end
of
a
stick
,
we
send
two
negro
with
it
to
the
bank
of
the
water
,
carry
the
pole
up
as
high
as
they
could
;
it
be
presently
understand
,
and
two
of
their
man
and
the
white
man
come
to
the
shore
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
white
man
speak
no
Portuguese
,
they
could
understand
nothing
of
one
another
but
by
sign
;
but
our
man
make
the
white
man
understand
that
they
have
white
man
with
them
too
,
at
which
they
say
the
white
man
laugh
.
<EOS>
however
,
to
be
short
,
our
man
come
back
,
and
tell
us
they
be
all
good
friend
,
and
in
about
an
hour
four
of
our
man
,
two
negro
,
and
the
black
prince
,
go
to
the
river
-
side
,
where
the
white
man
come
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
half
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
but
a
negro
come
run
to
me
,
and
tell
me
the
white
man
be
Inglese
,
as
he
call
him
;
upon
which
I
run
back
,
eagerly
enough
,
you
may
be
sure
,
with
him
,
and
find
,
as
he
say
,
that
he
be
an
Englishman
;
upon
which
he
embrace
me
very
passionately
,
the
tear
run
down
his
face
.
<EOS>
the
first
surprise
of
his
see
us
be
over
before
we
come
,
but
any
one
may
conceive
it
by
the
brief
account
he
give
us
afterwards
of
his
very
unhappy
circumstance
,
and
of
<EOS>
so
unexpected
a
deliverance
,
such
as
perhaps
never
happen
to
any
man
in
the
world
,
for
it
be
a
million
to
one
odd
that
ever
he
could
have
be
relieve
;
nothing
but
an
adventure
that
never
be
hear
or
read
of
before
could
have
suit
his
case
,
unless
Heaven
,
by
some
miracle
that
never
be
to
be
expect
,
have
act
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
a
gentleman
,
not
an
ordinary
-
breed
fellow
,
seaman
,
or
labour
man
;
this
show
itself
in
his
behaviour
in
the
first
moment
of
our
conversing
with
him
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
disadvantage
of
his
miserable
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
not
above
thirty
-
seven
or
thirty
-
eight
,
though
his
beard
be
grow
exceedingly
long
,
and
the
hair
of
his
head
and
face
strangely
cover
him
to
the
middle
of
his
back
and
breast
;
he
be
white
,
and
his
skin
very
fine
,
though
discolour
,
and
in
some
place
blister
,
and
cover
with
a
brown
blackish
substance
,
scurfy
,
scaly
,
and
hard
,
which
be
the
effect
of
the
scorching
heat
of
the
sun
;
he
be
stark
naked
,
and
have
be
so
,
as
he
tell
us
,
upwards
of
two
year
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
exceedingly
transport
at
our
meeting
with
him
,
that
he
could
scarce
enter
into
any
discourse
at
all
with
us
that
day
;
and
when
he
could
get
away
from
us
for
a
little
,
we
see
him
walk
alone
,
and
show
all
the
most
extravagant
token
of
an
ungovernable
joy
;
and
even
afterwards
he
be
never
without
tear
in
his
eye
for
several
day
,
upon
the
least
word
speak
by
us
of
his
circumstance
,
or
by
him
of
his
deliverance
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
his
behaviour
the
most
courteous
and
endear
<EOS>
I
ever
see
in
any
man
<EOS>
whatever
,
and
most
evident
token
of
a
mannerly
,
well
-
breed
person
appear
in
all
thing
he
do
or
say
,
and
our
people
be
exceedingly
take
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
scholar
and
a
mathematician
;
he
could
not
speak
Portuguese
indeed
,
but
he
speak
Latin
to
our
surgeon
,
French
to
another
of
our
man
,
and
italian
to
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
no
leisure
in
his
thought
to
ask
us
whence
we
come
,
whither
we
be
go
,
or
who
we
be
;
but
would
have
it
always
as
an
answer
to
himself
,
that
to
be
sure
,
wherever
we
be
a
-
going
,
we
come
from
Heaven
,
and
be
send
on
purpose
to
save
him
from
the
most
wretched
condition
that
ever
man
be
reduce
to
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
pitch
their
camp
on
the
bank
of
a
little
river
opposite
to
him
,
he
begin
to
inquire
what
store
of
provision
we
have
,
and
how
we
propose
to
be
supply
.
<EOS>
when
he
find
that
our
store
be
but
small
,
he
say
he
would
talk
with
the
native
,
and
we
should
have
provision
enough
;
for
he
say
they
be
the
most
courteous
,
good
-
natured
part
of
the
inhabitant
in
all
that
part
of
the
country
,
as
we
may
suppose
by
his
living
so
safe
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
this
gentleman
do
for
us
be
indeed
of
the
great
consequence
to
us
;
for
,
first
,
he
perfectly
inform
us
where
we
be
,
and
which
be
the
proper
course
for
us
to
steer
;
secondly
,
he
put
us
in
the
way
how
to
furnish
ourselves
effectually
with
provision
;
and
thirdly
,
he
be
our
complete
interpreter
and
peacemaker
with
all
the
native
,
who
now
begin
to
be
very
numerous
about
us
,
and
who
be
a
more
fierce
and
politic
people
than
those
we
have
meet
with
before
;
not
so
easily
terrified
with
our
arm
as
those
,
and
not
so
ignorant
as
to
give
their
provision
and
corn
for
our
little
toy
,
such
as
<EOS>
,
I
say
before
,
our
artificer
make
;
but
as
they
have
frequently
trade
and
converse
with
the
Europeans
on
the
coast
,
or
with
other
negro
nation
that
have
trade
and
be
concerned
with
them
,
they
be
the
less
ignorant
and
the
less
fearful
,
and
consequently
nothing
be
to
be
have
from
them
but
by
exchange
for
such
thing
as
they
like
.
  
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
say
of
the
negro
native
,
which
we
soon
come
among
;
but
as
to
these
poor
people
that
he
live
among
,
they
be
not
much
acquaint
with
thing
,
be
at
the
distance
of
above
300
mile
from
the
coast
;
only
that
they
find
elephant
'
tooth
upon
the
hill
to
the
north
,
which
they
take
and
carry
about
sixty
or
seventy
mile
south
,
where
other
trading
negro
usually
meet
them
,
and
give
them
bead
,
glass
,
shell
,
and
cowrie
,
for
them
,
such
as
the
English
and
Dutch
and
other
trader
<EOS>
furnish
them
with
from
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
We
now
begin
to
be
more
familiar
with
our
new
acquaintance
;
and
first
,
though
we
make
but
a
sorry
figure
as
to
clothe
ourselves
,
have
neither
shoe
,
or
stock
,
or
glove
,
or
hat
among
us
,
and
but
very
few
shirt
,
yet
as
well
as
we
could
we
clothe
him
;
and
first
,
our
surgeon
have
scissor
and
razor
,
shave
him
,
and
cut
his
hair
;
a
hat
,
as
I
say
,
we
have
not
in
all
our
store
,
but
he
supply
himself
by
make
himself
a
cap
of
a
piece
of
a
leopard
-
skin
,
most
artificially
.
<EOS>
as
for
shoe
or
stocking
,
he
have
go
so
long
without
them
that
he
care
not
even
for
the
buskin
and
foot
-
glove
<EOS>
we
wear
,
which
I
describe
above
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
have
be
curious
to
hear
the
whole
story
of
our
travel
,
and
be
exceedingly
delighted
with
the
relation
,
so
we
be
no
less
to
know
,
and
please
with
,
the
account
of
his
circumstance
,
and
the
history
of
his
come
to
that
strange
place
alone
,
and
in
that
condition
which
we
find
him
in
,
as
above
.
<EOS>
this
account
of
his
would
indeed
be
in
itself
the
subject
of
an
agreeable
history
,
and
would
be
as
long
and
divert
as
our
own
,
have
in
it
many
strange
and
extraordinary
incident
;
but
we
can
not
have
room
here
to
launch
out
into
so
long
a
digression
:
the
sum
of
his
history
be
this
:
    
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
factor
for
the
English
Guinea
Company
at
Sierra
Leone
,
or
some
other
of
their
settlement
which
have
be
take
by
the
French
,
where
he
have
be
plunder
of
all
his
own
effect
,
as
well
as
of
what
be
entrust
to
him
by
the
company
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
that
the
company
do
not
do
him
justice
in
restore
his
circumstance
,
or
in
further
employ
him
,
he
quit
their
service
,
and
be
employ
by
those
call
separate
trader
,
and
be
afterwards
out
of
employ
there
also
,
trade
on
his
own
account
;
when
,
pass
unwarily
into
one
of
the
company
's
settlement
,
he
be
either
betray
into
the
hand
of
some
of
the
native
,
or
,
somehow
or
other
,
be
surprised
by
them
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
they
do
not
kill
him
,
he
find
mean
to
escape
from
them
at
that
time
,
and
flee
to
another
nation
of
the
native
,
who
,
be
enemy
to
the
other
,
entertain
him
friendly
,
and
with
them
he
live
some
time
;
but
not
like
his
quarter
or
his
company
,
he
flee
again
,
and
several
time
change
his
landlord
:
sometimes
be
carry
by
force
,
sometimes
hurry
by
fear
,
as
circumstance
alter
with
him
(
the
variety
of
which
deserve
a
history
by
itself
)
,
till
at
last
he
have
wander
beyond
all
possibility
of
return
,
and
have
take
up
his
abode
where
we
find
him
,
where
he
be
well
receive
by
the
petty
king
of
the
tribe
he
live
with
;
and
he
,
in
return
,
instruct
them
how
to
value
the
product
of
their
labour
,
and
on
what
term
to
trade
with
those
negro
who
come
up
to
them
for
tooth
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
naked
,
and
have
no
clothe
,
so
he
be
naked
of
arm
for
his
defence
,
have
neither
gun
,
sword
,
staff
,
or
any
instrument
of
war
about
him
,
no
,
not
to
guard
himself
against
the
attack
of
a
wild
beast
,
of
which
the
country
be
very
full
.
<EOS>
We
ask
him
how
he
come
to
be
so
entirely
abandon
of
all
concern
for
his
safety
?
<EOS>
He
answer
,
that
to
him
,
that
have
so
often
wish
for
death
,
life
be
not
worth
defend
;
and
that
,
as
he
be
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
the
negro
,
they
have
much
the
more
confidence
in
him
,
see
he
have
no
weapon
to
hurt
them
.
<EOS>
as
for
wild
beast
,
he
be
not
much
concerned
about
that
,
for
he
scarce
ever
go
from
his
hut
;
but
if
he
do
,
the
negro
king
and
his
man
go
all
with
him
,
and
they
be
all
arm
with
bow
and
arrow
,
and
lance
,
with
which
they
would
kill
any
of
the
ravenous
creature
,
lion
as
well
as
other
;
but
that
they
seldom
come
abroad
in
the
day
;
and
if
the
negro
wander
anywhere
in
the
night
,
they
always
build
a
hut
for
themselves
,
and
make
a
fire
at
the
door
of
it
,
which
be
guard
enough
.
  
<EOS>
We
inquire
of
him
what
we
should
next
do
towards
get
to
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
we
be
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
english
league
from
the
coast
,
where
almost
all
the
european
settlement
and
factory
be
,
and
which
be
call
the
Gold
Coast
;
but
that
there
be
so
many
different
nation
of
negro
in
the
way
,
that
it
be
ten
to
one
if
we
be
not
either
fight
with
continually
,
or
starve
for
want
of
provision
;
but
that
there
be
two
other
way
to
go
,
which
,
if
he
have
have
any
company
to
go
with
him
,
he
have
often
contrive
to
make
his
escape
by
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
to
travel
full
west
,
which
,
though
it
be
farth
to
go
,
yet
be
not
so
full
of
people
,
and
the
people
we
should
find
would
be
so
much
the
civiller
to
us
,
or
be
so
much
the
easy
to
fight
with
;
or
that
the
other
way
be
,
if
possible
,
to
get
to
the
Rio
Grande
,
and
go
down
the
stream
in
canoe
.
<EOS>
We
tell
him
,
that
be
the
way
we
have
resolve
on
before
we
meet
with
him
;
but
then
he
tell
us
there
be
a
prodigious
desert
to
go
over
,
and
as
prodigious
wood
to
go
through
,
before
we
come
to
it
,
and
that
both
together
be
at
least
twenty
day
'
march
for
us
,
travel
as
hard
as
we
could
.
  
<EOS>
We
ask
him
if
there
be
no
horse
in
the
country
,
or
ass
,
or
even
bullock
or
buffalo
,
to
make
use
of
in
such
a
journey
,
and
we
show
him
ours
,
of
which
we
have
but
three
left
.
<EOS>
He
say
no
,
all
the
country
do
not
afford
anything
of
that
kind
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
us
that
in
this
great
wood
there
be
immense
number
of
elephant
;
and
upon
the
desert
,
great
multitude
of
lion
,
lynx
,
tiger
,
leopard
,
&
c.
;
and
that
it
be
to
that
wood
and
that
desert
that
the
negro
go
to
get
elephant
'
tooth
,
where
they
never
fail
to
find
a
great
number
.
  
<EOS>
We
inquire
still
more
,
and
particularly
the
way
to
the
Gold
Coast
,
and
if
there
be
no
river
to
ease
us
in
our
carriage
;
and
tell
him
,
as
to
the
negro
fight
with
us
,
we
be
not
much
concerned
at
that
;
nor
be
we
afraid
of
starve
,
for
if
they
have
any
victual
among
them
,
we
would
have
our
share
of
it
;
and
,
therefore
,
if
he
would
venture
to
show
us
the
way
,
we
would
venture
to
go
;
and
as
for
himself
,
we
tell
him
we
would
live
and
die
together
 
there
should
not
a
man
of
us
stir
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
us
,
with
all
his
heart
,
if
we
resolve
it
,
and
would
venture
,
we
may
be
assure
he
would
take
his
fate
with
us
,
and
he
would
endeavour
to
guide
us
in
such
a
way
as
we
should
meet
with
some
friendly
savage
who
would
use
us
well
,
and
perhaps
stand
by
us
against
some
other
,
who
be
less
tractable
;
so
,
in
a
word
,
we
all
resolve
to
go
full
south
for
the
Gold
Coast
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
he
come
to
us
again
,
and
be
all
meet
in
council
,
as
we
may
call
it
,
he
begin
to
talk
very
seriously
with
us
,
that
since
we
be
now
come
,
after
a
long
journey
,
to
a
view
of
the
end
of
our
trouble
,
and
have
be
so
obliging
to
him
as
to
offer
to
carry
him
with
us
,
he
have
be
all
night
revolve
in
his
mind
what
he
and
we
all
may
do
to
make
ourselves
some
amend
for
all
our
sorrow
;
and
first
,
he
say
,
he
be
to
let
me
know
that
we
be
just
then
in
one
of
the
rich
part
of
the
world
,
though
it
be
really
otherwise
but
a
desolate
,
disconsolate
wilderness
;
<EOS>
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
not
a
river
but
run
gold
 
not
a
desert
<EOS>
but
without
plough
bear
a
crop
of
ivory
.
<EOS>
what
mine
of
gold
,
what
immense
store
of
gold
,
those
mountain
may
contain
,
from
whence
these
river
come
,
or
the
shore
which
these
water
run
by
,
we
know
not
,
but
may
imagine
that
they
must
be
inconceivably
rich
,
see
so
much
be
wash
down
the
stream
by
the
water
wash
the
side
of
the
land
,
that
the
quantity
suffice
all
the
trader
which
the
european
world
send
thither
.
<EOS>
"
We
ask
him
how
far
they
go
for
it
,
see
the
ship
only
trade
upon
the
coast
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
that
the
negro
on
the
coast
search
the
river
up
for
the
length
of
150
or
200
mile
,
and
would
be
out
a
month
,
or
two
,
or
three
at
a
time
,
and
always
come
home
sufficiently
reward
;
"
but
,
"
say
he
,
"
they
never
come
thus
far
,
and
yet
hereabouts
be
as
much
gold
as
there
.
"
<EOS>
upon
this
he
tell
us
that
he
believe
he
may
have
get
a
hundred
pound
'
weight
of
gold
since
he
come
thither
,
if
he
have
employ
himself
to
look
and
work
for
it
;
but
as
he
know
not
what
to
do
with
it
,
and
have
long
since
despair
of
be
ever
deliver
from
the
misery
he
be
in
,
he
have
entirely
omit
it
.
"
<EOS>
for
what
advantage
have
it
be
to
me
,
"
say
he
,
"
or
what
rich
have
I
be
,
if
I
have
a
ton
of
gold
dust
,
and
lie
and
wallow
in
it
?
<EOS>
the
richness
of
it
,
"
say
he
,
"
would
not
give
me
one
moment
's
felicity
,
nor
relieve
me
in
the
present
exigency
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
you
all
see
,
it
would
not
buy
me
clothe
to
cover
me
,
or
a
drop
of
drink
to
save
me
from
perish
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
value
here
,
"
say
he
;
"
there
be
several
people
among
these
hut
that
would
weigh
gold
against
a
few
glass
bead
or
a
cockle
-
shell
,
and
give
you
a
handful
of
gold
-
dust
for
a
handful
of
cowrie
.
"
<EOS>
N.B.
 
<EOS>
these
be
little
shell
which
our
child
call
blackamoor
'
tooth
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
say
thus
he
pull
out
a
piece
of
an
earthen
pot
bake
hard
in
the
sun
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
some
of
the
dirt
of
this
country
,
and
if
I
would
I
could
have
get
a
great
deal
more
;
"
and
,
show
it
to
us
,
I
believe
there
be
in
it
between
two
and
three
pound
weight
of
gold
-
dust
,
of
the
same
kind
and
colour
with
that
we
have
get
already
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
after
we
have
look
at
it
a
while
,
he
tell
us
,
smile
,
we
be
his
deliverer
,
and
all
he
have
,
as
well
as
his
life
,
be
ours
;
and
therefore
,
as
this
would
be
of
value
to
us
when
we
come
to
our
own
country
,
so
he
desire
we
would
accept
of
it
among
us
;
and
that
be
the
only
time
that
he
have
repent
that
he
have
pick
up
no
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
speak
for
him
,
as
his
interpreter
,
to
my
comrade
,
and
in
their
name
thank
him
;
but
,
speak
to
them
in
Portuguese
,
I
desire
them
to
defer
the
acceptance
of
his
kindness
to
the
next
morning
;
and
so
I
do
,
tell
him
we
would
further
talk
of
this
part
in
the
morning
;
so
we
part
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
I
find
they
be
all
wonderfully
affected
with
his
discourse
,
and
with
the
generosity
of
his
temper
,
as
well
as
the
magnificence
of
his
present
,
which
in
another
place
have
be
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
not
to
detain
you
with
circumstance
,
we
agree
that
,
see
he
be
now
one
of
our
number
,
and
that
as
we
be
a
relief
to
him
in
carry
him
out
of
the
dismal
condition
he
be
in
,
so
he
be
equally
a
relief
to
us
,
in
be
our
guide
through
the
rest
of
the
country
,
our
interpreter
with
the
native
,
and
our
director
how
to
manage
with
the
savage
,
and
how
to
enrich
ourselves
with
the
wealth
of
the
country
;
that
,
therefore
,
we
would
put
his
gold
among
our
common
stock
,
and
every
one
should
give
him
as
much
as
would
make
his
up
just
as
much
as
any
single
share
of
our
own
,
and
for
the
future
we
would
take
our
lot
together
,
take
his
solemn
engagement
to
us
,
as
we
have
before
one
to
another
,
that
we
would
not
conceal
the
least
grain
of
gold
we
find
one
from
another
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
conference
we
acquaint
him
with
the
adventure
of
the
Golden
River
,
and
how
we
have
share
what
we
get
there
,
so
that
every
man
have
a
large
stock
than
he
for
his
share
;
that
,
therefore
,
instead
of
take
any
from
him
,
we
have
resolve
every
one
to
add
a
little
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
appear
very
glad
that
we
have
meet
with
such
good
success
,
but
would
not
take
a
grain
from
us
,
till
at
last
,
press
him
very
hard
,
he
tell
us
,
that
then
he
would
take
it
thus
:
 
that
,
when
we
come
to
get
any
more
,
he
would
have
so
much
out
of
the
first
as
should
make
him
even
,
and
then
we
would
go
on
as
equal
adventurer
;
and
thus
we
agree
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
tell
us
he
think
it
would
not
be
an
unprofitable
adventure
if
,
before
we
set
forward
,
and
after
we
have
get
a
stock
of
provision
,
we
should
make
a
journey
north
to
the
edge
of
the
desert
he
have
tell
us
of
,
from
whence
our
negro
may
bring
every
one
a
large
elephant
's
tooth
,
and
that
he
would
get
some
more
to
assist
;
and
that
,
after
a
certain
length
of
carriage
,
they
may
be
convey
by
canoe
to
the
coast
,
where
they
would
yield
a
very
great
profit
.
  
<EOS>
I
object
against
this
on
account
of
our
other
design
we
have
of
get
gold
-
dust
;
and
that
our
negro
,
who
we
know
would
be
faithful
to
us
,
would
get
much
more
by
search
the
river
for
gold
for
us
than
by
lug
a
great
tooth
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
pound
weight
a
hundred
mile
or
more
,
which
would
be
an
insufferable
labour
to
them
after
so
hard
a
journey
,
and
would
certainly
kill
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
acquiesce
in
the
justice
of
this
answer
,
but
fain
would
have
have
us
go
to
see
the
woody
part
of
the
hill
and
the
edge
of
the
desert
,
that
we
may
see
how
the
elephant
'
tooth
lie
scatter
up
and
down
there
;
but
when
we
tell
him
the
story
of
what
we
have
see
before
,
as
be
say
above
,
he
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
We
stay
here
twelve
day
,
during
which
time
the
native
be
very
obliging
to
us
,
and
bring
us
fruit
,
pompion
,
and
a
root
like
carrot
,
though
of
quite
another
taste
,
but
not
unpleasant
neither
,
and
some
guinea
-
fowl
,
whose
name
we
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
they
bring
us
plenty
of
what
they
have
,
and
we
live
very
well
,
and
we
give
them
all
such
little
thing
as
our
cutler
have
make
,
for
he
have
now
a
whole
bag
full
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
thirteenth
day
we
set
forward
,
take
our
new
gentleman
with
us
.
<EOS>
at
parting
,
the
negro
king
send
two
savage
with
a
present
to
him
of
some
dry
flesh
,
but
I
do
not
remember
what
it
be
,
and
he
give
him
again
three
silver
bird
which
our
cutler
help
him
to
,
which
I
assure
you
be
a
present
for
a
king
.
  
<EOS>
We
travel
now
south
,
a
little
west
,
and
here
we
find
the
first
river
for
above
2000
mile
'
march
,
whose
water
run
south
,
all
the
rest
run
north
or
west
.
<EOS>
We
follow
this
river
,
which
be
no
big
than
a
good
large
brook
in
England
,
till
it
begin
to
increase
its
water
.
<EOS>
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
we
find
our
Englishman
go
down
as
it
be
privately
to
the
water
,
which
be
to
try
the
land
;
at
length
,
after
a
day
's
march
upon
this
river
,
he
come
run
up
to
us
with
his
hand
full
of
sand
,
and
say
,
"
look
here
.
<EOS>
"
upon
look
we
find
that
a
good
deal
of
gold
lie
spangle
among
the
sand
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
think
we
may
begin
to
work
;
"
so
he
divide
our
negro
into
couple
and
set
them
to
work
,
to
search
and
wash
the
sand
and
ooze
in
the
bottom
of
the
water
where
it
be
not
deep
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
day
and
a
quarter
our
man
all
together
have
gather
a
pound
and
two
ounce
of
gold
or
thereabout
,
and
as
we
find
the
quantity
increase
the
farther
<EOS>
we
go
,
we
follow
it
about
three
day
,
till
another
small
rivulet
join
the
first
,
and
then
search
up
the
stream
,
we
find
gold
there
too
;
so
we
pitch
our
camp
in
the
angle
where
the
river
join
,
and
we
divert
ourselves
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
in
wash
the
gold
out
of
the
sand
of
the
river
,
and
in
get
provision
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
stay
thirteen
day
more
,
in
which
time
we
have
many
pleasant
adventure
with
the
savage
,
too
long
to
mention
here
,
and
some
of
them
too
homely
to
tell
of
,
for
some
of
our
man
have
make
something
free
with
their
woman
,
which
,
have
not
our
new
guide
make
peace
for
us
with
one
of
their
man
at
the
price
of
seven
fine
bit
of
silver
,
which
our
artificer
have
cut
out
into
the
shape
of
lion
,
and
fish
,
and
bird
,
and
have
punch
hole
to
hang
them
up
by
(
an
inestimable
treasure
)
,
we
must
have
go
to
war
with
them
and
all
their
people
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
while
we
be
busy
wash
gold
-
dust
out
of
the
river
,
and
our
negro
the
like
,
our
ingenious
cutler
be
hammer
and
cut
,
and
he
be
grow
so
dexterous
by
use
that
he
form
all
manner
of
image
.
<EOS>
He
cut
out
elephant
,
tiger
,
civet
cat
,
ostrich
,
eagle
,
crane
,
fowl
,
fish
,
and
indeed
whatever
he
please
,
in
thin
plate
of
hammer
gold
,
for
his
silver
and
iron
be
almost
all
go
.
  
<EOS>
at
one
of
the
town
of
these
savage
nation
we
be
very
friendly
receive
by
their
king
,
and
as
he
be
very
much
take
with
our
workman
's
toy
,
he
sell
him
an
elephant
cut
out
of
a
gold
plate
as
thin
as
a
sixpence
at
an
extravagant
rate
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
much
take
with
it
that
he
would
not
be
quiet
till
he
have
give
him
almost
a
handful
of
gold
-
dust
,
as
they
call
it
;
I
suppose
it
may
weigh
three
-
quarter
of
a
pound
;
the
piece
of
gold
that
the
elephant
be
make
of
may
be
about
the
weight
of
a
pistole
,
rather
less
than
more
.
<EOS>
Our
artist
be
so
honest
,
though
the
labour
and
art
be
all
his
own
,
that
he
bring
all
the
gold
and
put
it
into
our
common
stock
;
but
we
have
,
indeed
,
no
manner
of
reason
in
the
least
to
be
covetous
,
for
,
as
our
new
guide
tell
us
,
we
that
be
strong
enough
to
defend
ourselves
,
and
have
time
enough
to
stay
(
for
we
be
none
of
us
in
haste
)
,
may
in
time
get
together
what
quantity
of
gold
we
please
,
even
to
an
hundred
pound
weight
each
man
if
we
think
fit
;
and
therefore
he
tell
us
,
though
he
have
as
much
reason
to
be
sick
of
the
country
as
any
of
us
,
yet
if
we
think
to
turn
our
march
a
little
to
the
south
-
east
,
and
pitch
upon
a
place
proper
for
our
headquarter
,
we
may
find
provision
plenty
enough
,
and
extend
ourselves
over
the
country
among
the
river
for
two
or
three
year
to
the
right
and
leave
,
and
we
should
soon
find
the
advantage
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
proposal
,
however
good
as
to
the
profitable
part
of
it
,
suited
none
of
us
,
for
we
be
all
more
desirous
to
get
home
than
to
be
rich
,
be
tired
of
the
excessive
fatigue
of
above
a
year
's
continual
wandering
among
desert
and
wild
beast
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
tongue
of
our
new
acquaintance
have
a
kind
of
charm
in
it
,
and
use
such
argument
,
and
have
so
much
the
power
of
persuasion
,
that
there
be
no
resist
him
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
it
be
preposterous
not
to
take
the
fruit
of
all
our
labour
<EOS>
now
we
be
come
to
the
harvest
;
that
we
may
see
the
hazard
the
Europeans
run
with
ship
and
man
,
and
at
great
expense
,
to
fetch
a
little
gold
,
and
that
we
,
that
be
in
the
centre
of
it
,
to
go
away
<EOS>
empty
-
handed
be
unaccountable
;
that
we
be
strong
enough
to
fight
our
way
through
whole
nation
,
and
may
make
our
journey
afterward
to
what
part
of
the
coast
we
please
,
and
we
should
never
forgive
ourselves
when
we
come
to
our
own
country
to
see
we
have
500
pistole
in
gold
,
and
may
as
easily
have
have
5000
or
10,000
,
or
what
we
please
;
that
he
be
no
more
covetous
than
we
,
but
see
it
be
in
all
our
power
to
retrieve
our
misfortune
at
once
,
and
to
make
ourselves
easy
for
all
our
life
,
he
could
not
be
faithful
to
us
,
or
grateful
for
the
good
we
have
do
him
,
if
he
do
not
let
us
see
the
advantage
we
have
in
our
hand
;
and
he
assure
us
he
would
make
it
clear
to
our
own
understanding
,
that
we
may
in
two
year
'
time
,
by
good
management
and
by
the
help
of
our
negro
,
gather
every
man
a
hundred
pound
weight
of
gold
,
and
get
together
perhaps
two
hundred
ton
of
tooth
;
whereas
,
if
once
we
push
on
to
the
coast
and
separate
,
we
should
never
be
able
to
see
that
place
again
with
our
eye
,
or
do
any
more
than
sinner
do
with
heaven
,
 
wish
themselves
there
,
but
know
they
can
never
come
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
Our
surgeon
be
the
first
man
that
yield
to
his
reasoning
,
and
after
him
the
gunner
;
and
they
too
,
indeed
,
have
a
great
influence
over
us
,
but
none
of
the
rest
have
any
mind
to
stay
,
nor
I
neither
,
I
must
confess
;
for
I
have
no
notion
of
a
great
deal
of
money
,
or
what
to
do
with
myself
,
or
what
to
do
with
it
if
I
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
enough
already
,
and
all
the
thought
I
have
about
dispose
of
it
,
if
I
come
to
Europe
,
be
only
how
to
spend
it
as
fast
as
I
could
,
buy
me
some
clothe
,
and
go
to
sea
again
to
be
a
drudge
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
prevail
with
us
by
his
good
word
at
last
to
stay
but
for
six
month
in
the
country
,
and
then
,
if
we
do
resolve
to
go
,
he
would
submit
;
so
at
length
we
yield
to
that
,
and
he
carry
us
about
fifty
english
mile
south
-
east
,
where
we
find
several
rivulet
of
water
,
which
seem
to
come
all
from
a
great
ridge
of
mountain
,
which
lie
to
the
north
-
east
,
and
which
,
by
our
calculation
,
must
be
the
beginning
that
way
of
the
great
waste
,
which
we
have
be
force
northward
to
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
find
the
country
barren
enough
,
but
yet
we
have
by
his
direction
plenty
of
food
;
for
the
savage
round
us
,
upon
give
them
some
of
our
toy
,
as
I
have
so
often
mention
,
bring
us
in
whatever
they
have
;
and
here
we
find
some
maize
,
or
indian
wheat
,
which
the
negro
woman
plant
,
as
we
sow
seed
in
a
garden
,
and
immediately
our
new
provider
order
some
of
our
negro
to
plant
it
,
and
it
grow
up
presently
,
and
by
water
it
often
,
we
have
a
crop
in
less
than
three
month
'
growth
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
be
settle
,
and
our
camp
fix
,
we
fall
to
the
old
trade
of
fishing
for
gold
in
the
river
mention
above
,
and
our
english
gentleman
so
well
know
how
to
direct
our
search
,
that
we
scarce
ever
lose
our
labour
.
  
<EOS>
one
time
,
have
set
us
to
work
,
he
ask
if
we
would
give
him
leave
,
with
four
or
five
negro
,
to
go
out
for
six
or
seven
day
to
seek
his
fortune
,
and
see
what
he
could
discover
in
the
country
,
assure
us
whatever
he
get
should
be
for
the
public
stock
.
<EOS>
We
all
give
him
our
consent
,
and
lend
him
a
gun
;
and
two
of
our
man
desire
to
go
with
him
,
they
take
then
six
negro
with
them
,
and
two
of
our
buffalo
that
come
with
us
the
whole
journey
;
they
take
about
eight
day
'
provision
of
bread
with
them
,
but
no
flesh
,
except
about
as
much
dry
flesh
as
would
serve
them
two
day
.
  
<EOS>
They
travel
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
I
mention
just
now
,
where
they
see
(
as
our
man
afterwards
vouch
it
to
be
)
<EOS>
the
same
desert
which
we
be
so
justly
terrified
at
when
we
be
on
the
farther
side
,
and
which
,
by
our
calculation
,
could
not
be
less
than
300
mile
broad
and
above
600
mile
in
length
,
without
know
where
it
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
journal
of
their
travel
be
too
long
to
enter
upon
here
.
<EOS>
They
stay
out
two
-
and
-
fifty
day
,
when
they
bring
us
seventeen
pound
and
something
more
(
for
we
have
no
exact
weight
)
of
gold
-
dust
,
some
of
it
in
much
large
piece
than
any
we
have
find
before
,
besides
about
fifteen
ton
of
elephant
'
tooth
,
which
he
have
,
partly
by
good
usage
and
partly
by
bad
,
oblige
the
savage
of
the
country
to
fetch
,
and
bring
down
to
him
from
the
mountain
,
and
which
he
make
other
bring
with
him
quite
down
to
our
camp
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
wonder
what
be
come
to
us
when
we
see
him
attend
with
above
200
negro
;
but
he
soon
undeceive
us
,
when
he
make
them
all
throw
down
their
burden
on
a
heap
at
the
entrance
of
our
camp
.
  
<EOS>
besides
this
,
they
bring
two
lion
'
skin
,
and
five
leopard
'
skin
,
very
large
and
very
fine
.
<EOS>
He
ask
our
pardon
for
his
long
stay
,
and
that
he
have
make
no
great
a
booty
,
but
tell
us
he
have
one
excursion
more
to
make
,
which
he
hope
should
turn
to
a
well
account
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
have
rest
himself
and
reward
the
savage
that
bring
the
tooth
for
him
with
some
bit
of
silver
and
iron
cut
out
diamond
fashion
,
and
with
two
shape
like
little
dog
,
he
send
them
away
mightily
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
journey
he
go
,
some
more
of
our
man
desire
to
go
with
him
,
and
they
make
a
troop
of
ten
white
man
and
ten
savage
,
and
the
two
buffalo
to
carry
their
provision
and
ammunition
.
<EOS>
They
take
the
same
course
,
only
not
exactly
the
same
track
,
and
they
stay
thirty
-
two
day
only
,
in
which
time
they
kill
no
less
than
fifteen
leopard
,
three
lion
,
and
several
other
creature
,
and
bring
us
home
four
-
and
-
twenty
pound
some
ounce
of
gold
-
dust
,
and
only
six
elephant
'
tooth
,
but
they
be
very
great
one
.
  
<EOS>
Our
friend
the
Englishman
show
us
that
now
our
time
be
well
bestow
,
for
in
five
month
which
we
have
stay
here
,
we
have
gather
so
much
gold
-
dust
that
,
when
we
come
to
share
it
,
we
have
five
pound
and
a
quarter
to
a
man
,
besides
what
we
have
before
,
and
besides
six
or
seven
pound
weight
which
we
have
at
several
time
give
our
artificer
to
make
bauble
with
.
<EOS>
and
now
we
talk
of
go
forward
to
the
coast
to
put
an
end
to
our
journey
;
but
our
guide
laugh
at
us
then
.
<EOS>
"
nay
,
you
can
not
go
now
,
"
say
he
,
"
for
the
rainy
season
begin
next
month
,
and
there
will
be
no
stir
then
.
<EOS>
"
this
we
find
,
indeed
,
reasonable
,
so
we
resolve
to
furnish
ourselves
with
provision
,
that
we
may
not
be
oblige
to
go
abroad
too
much
in
the
rain
,
and
we
spread
ourselves
some
one
way
and
some
another
,
as
far
as
we
care
to
venture
,
to
get
provision
;
and
our
negro
kill
us
some
deer
,
which
we
cure
as
well
as
we
could
in
the
sun
,
for
we
have
now
no
salt
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
rainy
month
be
set
in
,
and
we
could
scarce
,
for
above
two
month
,
look
out
of
our
hut
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
all
,
for
the
river
be
so
swell
with
the
land
-
flood
,
that
we
scarce
know
the
little
brooks
and
rivulet
from
the
great
navigable
river
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
a
very
good
opportunity
to
have
convey
by
water
,
upon
raft
,
our
elephant
'
tooth
,
of
which
we
have
a
very
great
pile
;
for
,
as
we
always
give
the
savage
some
reward
for
their
labour
,
the
very
woman
would
bring
us
tooth
upon
every
opportunity
,
and
sometimes
a
great
tooth
carry
between
two
;
so
that
our
quantity
be
increase
to
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
ton
of
tooth
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
weather
prove
fair
again
,
he
tell
us
he
would
not
press
us
to
any
further
stay
,
since
we
do
not
care
whether
we
get
any
more
gold
or
no
;
that
we
be
indeed
the
first
man
he
ever
meet
with
in
his
life
that
say
they
have
gold
enough
,
and
of
whom
it
may
be
truly
say
,
that
,
when
it
lie
under
our
foot
,
we
would
not
stoop
to
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
but
,
since
he
have
make
us
a
promise
,
he
would
not
break
it
,
nor
press
us
to
make
any
further
stay
;
only
he
think
he
ought
to
tell
us
that
now
be
the
time
,
after
the
land
-
flood
,
when
the
great
quantity
of
gold
be
find
;
and
that
,
if
we
stay
but
one
month
,
we
should
see
thousand
of
savage
spread
themselves
over
the
whole
country
to
wash
the
gold
out
of
the
sand
,
for
the
european
ship
which
would
come
on
the
coast
;
that
they
do
it
then
,
because
the
rage
of
the
flood
always
work
down
a
great
deal
of
gold
out
of
the
hill
;
and
,
if
we
take
the
advantage
to
be
there
before
them
,
we
do
not
know
what
extraordinary
thing
we
may
find
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
forcible
,
and
so
well
argue
,
that
it
appear
in
all
our
face
we
be
prevail
upon
;
<EOS>
so
we
tell
him
we
would
all
stay
:
<EOS>
for
though
it
be
true
we
be
all
eager
to
be
go
,
yet
the
evident
prospect
of
so
much
advantage
could
not
well
be
resist
;
that
he
be
greatly
mistaken
,
when
he
suggest
that
we
do
not
desire
to
increase
our
store
of
gold
,
and
in
that
we
be
resolve
to
make
the
utmost
use
of
the
advantage
that
be
in
our
hand
,
and
would
stay
as
long
as
any
gold
be
to
be
have
,
if
it
be
another
year
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
express
the
joy
he
be
in
on
this
occasion
;
and
the
fair
weather
come
on
,
we
begin
,
just
as
he
direct
,
to
search
about
the
river
for
more
gold
.
<EOS>
at
first
we
have
but
little
encouragement
,
and
begin
to
be
doubtful
;
but
it
be
very
plain
that
the
reason
be
,
the
water
be
not
fully
fall
,
or
the
river
reduce
to
their
usual
channel
;
but
in
a
few
day
we
be
fully
requite
,
and
find
much
more
gold
than
at
first
,
and
in
big
lump
;
and
one
of
our
man
wash
out
of
the
sand
a
piece
of
gold
as
big
as
a
small
nut
,
which
weigh
,
by
our
estimation
 
<EOS>
for
we
have
no
small
weight
 
almost
an
ounce
and
a
half
.
  
<EOS>
this
success
make
us
extremely
diligent
;
and
in
little
more
than
a
month
we
have
altogether
get
near
sixty
pound
weight
of
gold
;
but
after
this
,
as
he
tell
us
,
we
find
abundance
of
the
savage
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
hunt
every
river
and
brook
,
and
even
the
dry
land
of
the
hill
for
gold
;
so
that
we
could
do
nothing
like
then
,
compare
to
what
we
have
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
artificer
find
a
way
to
make
other
people
find
us
in
gold
without
our
own
labour
;
for
,
when
these
people
begin
to
appear
,
he
have
a
considerable
quantity
of
his
toy
,
bird
,
beast
,
&
c.
,
such
as
before
,
ready
for
them
;
and
the
english
gentleman
be
the
interpreter
,
he
bring
the
savage
to
admire
them
;
so
our
cutler
have
trade
enough
,
and
,
to
be
sure
,
sell
his
good
at
a
monstrous
rate
;
for
he
would
get
an
ounce
of
gold
,
sometimes
two
,
for
a
bit
of
silver
,
perhaps
of
the
value
of
a
groat
;
<EOS>
nay
,
if
it
be
iron
and
if
it
be
of
gold
,
they
would
not
give
the
more
for
it
;
and
it
be
incredible
almost
to
think
what
a
quantity
of
gold
he
get
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
to
bring
this
happy
journey
to
a
conclusion
,
we
increase
our
stock
of
gold
here
,
in
three
month
'
stay
more
,
to
such
a
degree
that
,
bring
it
all
to
a
common
stock
,
in
order
to
share
it
,
we
divide
almost
four
pound
weight
again
to
every
man
;
and
then
we
set
forward
for
the
Gold
Coast
,
to
see
what
method
we
could
find
out
for
our
passage
into
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
there
happen
several
remarkable
incident
in
this
part
of
our
journey
,
as
to
how
we
be
,
or
be
not
,
receive
friendly
by
the
several
nation
of
savage
through
which
we
pass
;
how
we
deliver
one
negro
king
from
captivity
,
who
have
be
a
benefactor
to
our
new
guide
;
and
now
our
guide
,
in
gratitude
,
by
our
assistance
,
restore
him
to
his
kingdom
,
which
,
perhaps
,
may
contain
about
300
subject
;
how
he
entertain
us
;
and
how
he
make
his
subject
go
with
our
englishman
,
and
fetch
all
our
elephant
'
tooth
which
we
have
be
oblige
to
leave
behind
us
,
and
to
carry
them
for
us
to
the
river
,
the
name
of
which
I
forget
,
where
we
make
raft
,
and
in
eleven
day
more
come
down
to
one
of
the
dutch
settlement
on
the
Gold
Coast
,
where
we
arrive
in
perfect
health
,
and
to
our
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
as
for
our
cargo
of
tooth
,
we
sell
it
to
the
dutch
factory
,
and
receive
clothe
and
other
necessary
for
ourselves
,
and
such
of
our
negro
as
we
think
fit
to
keep
with
us
;
and
it
be
to
be
observe
,
that
we
have
four
pound
of
gunpowder
leave
when
we
end
our
journey
.
<EOS>
the
negro
prince
we
make
perfectly
free
,
clothe
him
out
of
our
common
stock
,
and
give
him
a
pound
and
a
half
of
gold
for
himself
,
which
he
know
very
well
how
to
manage
;
and
here
we
all
part
after
the
most
friendly
manner
possible
.
<EOS>
Our
Englishman
remain
in
the
dutch
factory
some
time
,
and
,
as
I
hear
afterwards
,
die
there
of
grief
;
for
he
have
send
a
thousand
pound
sterling
over
to
England
,
by
the
way
of
Holland
,
for
his
refuge
at
his
return
to
his
friend
,
the
ship
be
take
by
the
French
and
the
effect
all
lose
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
my
comrade
go
away
,
in
a
small
bark
,
to
the
two
portuguese
factory
,
near
Gambia
,
in
the
latitude
of
fourteen
;
and
I
,
with
two
negro
which
I
keep
with
me
,
go
away
to
Cape
Coast
Castle
,
where
I
get
passage
for
England
,
and
arrive
there
in
September
;
and
thus
end
my
first
harvest
of
wild
oat
;
the
rest
be
not
sow
to
so
much
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
neither
friend
,
relation
,
nor
acquaintance
in
England
,
though
it
be
my
native
country
;
I
have
consequently
no
person
to
trust
with
what
I
have
,
or
to
counsel
me
to
secure
or
save
it
;
but
,
fall
into
ill
company
,
and
trust
the
keeper
of
a
public
-
house
in
Rotherhithe
with
a
great
part
of
my
money
,
and
hastily
squander
away
the
rest
,
all
that
great
sum
,
which
I
get
with
so
much
pain
and
hazard
,
be
go
in
little
more
than
two
year
'
time
;
and
,
as
I
even
rage
in
my
own
thought
to
reflect
upon
the
manner
how
it
be
waste
,
so
I
need
record
no
more
;
the
rest
merit
to
be
conceal
with
blush
,
for
that
it
be
spend
in
all
kind
of
folly
and
wickedness
.
<EOS>
so
this
scene
of
my
life
may
be
say
to
have
begin
in
theft
,
and
end
in
luxury
;
a
sad
setting
-
out
,
and
a
bad
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
year
#
#
#
#
I
begin
to
see
the
bottom
of
my
stock
,
and
that
it
be
time
to
think
of
further
adventure
;
for
my
spoiler
,
as
I
call
them
,
begin
to
let
me
know
,
that
as
my
money
decline
,
their
respect
would
ebb
with
it
,
and
that
I
have
nothing
to
expect
of
them
further
than
as
I
may
command
it
by
the
force
of
my
money
,
which
,
in
short
,
would
not
go
an
inch
the
further
for
all
that
have
be
spend
in
their
favour
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
shock
me
very
much
,
and
I
conceive
a
just
abhorrence
of
their
ingratitude
;
but
it
wear
off
;
nor
have
I
meet
with
any
regret
at
the
wasting
so
glorious
a
sum
of
money
as
I
bring
to
England
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
next
ship
myself
,
in
an
evil
hour
to
be
sure
,
on
a
voyage
to
Cadiz
,
in
a
ship
call
the
#
#
#
#
,
and
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
voyage
,
be
on
the
coast
of
Spain
,
be
oblige
to
put
into
the
Groyn
,
by
a
strong
southwest
wind
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
fall
into
company
with
some
master
of
mischief
;
and
,
among
them
,
one
,
forwarder
than
the
rest
,
begin
an
intimate
confidence
with
me
,
so
that
we
call
one
another
brother
,
and
communicate
all
our
circumstance
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Harris
.
<EOS>
this
fellow
come
to
me
one
morning
,
ask
me
if
I
would
go
on
shore
,
and
I
agree
;
so
we
get
the
captain
's
leave
for
the
boat
,
and
go
together
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
together
,
he
ask
me
if
I
have
a
mind
for
an
adventure
that
may
make
amend
for
all
past
misfortune
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
yes
,
with
all
my
heart
;
for
I
do
not
care
where
I
go
,
have
nothing
to
lose
,
and
no
one
to
leave
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
ask
me
if
I
would
swear
to
be
secret
,
and
that
,
if
I
do
not
agree
to
what
he
propose
,
I
would
nevertheless
never
betray
him
.
<EOS>
I
readily
bind
myself
to
that
,
upon
the
most
solemn
imprecation
and
curse
that
the
devil
and
both
of
us
could
invent
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
then
,
there
be
a
brave
fellow
in
the
other
ship
,
point
to
another
english
ship
which
ride
in
the
harbour
,
who
,
in
concert
with
some
of
the
man
,
have
resolve
to
mutiny
the
next
morning
,
and
run
away
with
the
ship
;
and
that
,
if
we
could
get
strength
enough
among
our
ship
's
company
,
we
may
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
like
the
proposal
very
well
,
and
he
get
eight
of
us
to
join
with
him
,
and
he
tell
us
,
that
as
soon
as
his
friend
have
begin
the
work
,
and
be
master
of
the
ship
,
we
should
be
ready
to
do
the
like
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
plot
;
and
I
,
without
the
least
hesitation
,
either
at
the
villainy
of
the
fact
or
the
difficulty
of
perform
it
,
come
immediately
into
the
wicked
conspiracy
,
and
so
it
go
on
among
us
;
but
we
could
not
bring
our
part
to
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
on
the
day
appoint
,
his
correspondent
in
the
other
ship
,
whose
name
be
Wilmot
,
begin
the
work
,
and
,
have
seize
the
captain
's
mate
and
other
officer
,
secure
the
ship
,
and
give
the
signal
to
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
but
eleven
in
our
ship
,
who
be
in
the
conspiracy
,
nor
could
we
get
any
more
that
we
could
trust
;
so
that
,
leave
the
ship
,
we
all
take
the
boat
,
and
go
off
to
join
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
leave
the
ship
I
be
in
,
we
be
entertain
with
a
great
deal
of
joy
by
Captain
Wilmot
and
his
new
gang
;
and
,
be
well
prepared
for
all
manner
of
roguery
,
bold
,
desperate
(
I
mean
myself
)
,
without
the
least
check
of
conscience
for
what
I
be
enter
upon
,
or
for
anything
I
may
do
,
much
less
with
any
apprehension
of
what
may
be
the
consequence
of
it
;
I
say
,
have
thus
embark
with
this
crew
,
which
at
last
bring
me
to
consort
with
the
most
famous
pirate
of
the
age
,
some
of
whom
have
end
their
journal
at
the
gallow
,
I
think
the
give
an
account
of
some
of
my
other
adventure
may
be
an
agreeable
piece
of
story
;
and
this
I
may
venture
to
say
beforehand
,
upon
the
word
of
a
pirate
,
that
I
shall
not
be
able
to
recollect
the
full
,
no
,
not
by
far
,
of
the
great
variety
which
have
form
one
of
the
most
reprobate
scheme
that
ever
man
be
capable
to
present
to
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
that
be
,
as
I
have
hint
before
,
an
original
thief
,
and
a
pirate
,
even
by
inclination
before
,
be
now
in
my
element
,
and
never
undertake
anything
in
my
life
with
more
particular
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wilmot
(
for
so
we
be
now
to
call
him
)
be
thus
possess
of
a
ship
,
and
in
the
manner
as
you
have
hear
,
it
may
be
easily
conclude
he
have
nothing
to
do
to
stay
in
the
port
,
or
to
wait
either
the
attempt
that
may
be
make
from
the
shore
,
or
any
change
that
may
happen
among
his
man
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
we
weigh
anchor
the
same
tide
,
and
stand
out
to
sea
,
steer
away
for
the
Canaries
.
<EOS>
Our
ship
have
twenty
-
two
gun
,
but
be
able
to
carry
thirty
;
and
besides
,
as
she
be
fit
out
for
a
merchant
-
ship
only
,
she
be
not
furnish
either
with
ammunition
or
small
-
arm
sufficient
for
our
design
,
or
for
the
occasion
we
may
have
in
case
of
a
fight
.
<EOS>
so
we
put
into
Cadiz
,
that
be
to
say
,
we
come
to
an
anchor
in
the
bay
;
and
the
captain
,
and
one
whom
we
call
young
Captain
Kidd
,
who
be
the
gunner
,
[
land
,
]
and
some
of
the
man
who
could
best
be
trust
,
among
whom
be
my
comrade
Harris
,
who
be
make
second
mate
,
and
myself
,
who
be
make
a
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
some
bale
of
english
good
be
propose
to
be
carry
on
shore
with
us
for
sale
,
but
my
comrade
,
who
be
a
complete
fellow
at
his
business
,
propose
a
well
way
for
it
;
and
have
be
in
the
town
before
,
tell
us
,
in
short
,
that
he
would
buy
what
powder
and
bullet
,
small
-
arm
,
or
anything
else
we
want
,
on
his
own
word
,
to
be
pay
for
when
they
come
on
board
,
in
such
english
good
as
we
have
there
.
<EOS>
this
be
much
the
good
way
,
and
accordingly
he
and
the
captain
go
on
shore
by
themselves
,
and
have
make
such
a
bargain
as
they
find
for
their
turn
,
come
away
again
in
two
hour
'
time
,
and
bring
only
a
butt
of
wine
and
five
cask
of
brandy
with
them
,
we
all
go
on
board
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
two
barcos
longos
come
off
to
us
,
deeply
laden
,
with
five
Spaniards
on
board
them
,
for
traffic
.
<EOS>
Our
captain
sell
them
good
pennyworth
,
and
they
deliver
us
sixteen
barrel
of
powder
,
twelve
small
rundlet
of
fine
powder
for
our
small
-
arm
,
sixty
musket
,
and
twelve
fusee
for
the
officer
;
seventeen
ton
of
cannon
-
ball
,
fifteen
barrel
of
musket
-
bullet
,
with
some
sword
and
twenty
good
pair
of
pistol
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
they
bring
thirteen
butts
of
wine
(
for
we
,
that
be
now
all
become
gentleman
,
scorn
to
drink
the
ship
's
beer
)
,
also
sixteen
puncheon
of
brandy
,
with
twelve
barrel
of
raisin
and
twenty
chest
of
lemon
;
all
which
we
pay
for
in
english
good
;
and
,
over
and
above
,
the
captain
receive
six
hundred
piece
of
eight
in
money
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
come
again
,
but
we
would
stay
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
from
hence
we
sail
to
the
Canaries
,
and
from
thence
onward
to
the
West
Indies
,
where
we
commit
some
depredation
upon
the
Spaniards
for
provision
,
and
take
some
prize
,
but
none
of
any
great
value
,
while
I
remain
with
them
,
which
be
not
long
at
that
time
;
for
,
have
take
a
spanish
sloop
on
the
coast
of
Carthagena
,
my
friend
make
a
motion
to
me
,
that
we
should
desire
Captain
Wilmot
to
put
us
into
the
sloop
,
with
a
proportion
of
arm
and
ammunition
,
and
let
us
try
what
we
could
do
;
she
be
much
fitter
for
our
business
than
the
great
ship
,
and
a
better
sailer
.
<EOS>
this
he
consent
to
,
and
we
appoint
our
rendezvous
at
Tobago
,
make
an
agreement
,
that
whatever
be
take
by
either
of
our
ship
should
be
share
among
the
ship
's
company
of
both
;
all
which
we
very
punctually
observe
,
and
join
our
ship
again
,
about
fifteen
month
after
,
at
the
island
of
Tobago
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
We
cruise
near
two
year
in
those
sea
,
chiefly
upon
the
Spaniards
;
not
that
we
make
any
difficulty
of
take
english
ship
,
or
dutch
,
or
French
,
if
they
come
in
our
way
;
and
particularly
,
Captain
Wilmot
attack
a
New
England
ship
bind
from
the
Madeiras
to
Jamaica
,
and
another
bind
from
New
York
to
Barbados
,
with
provision
;
which
last
be
a
very
happy
supply
to
us
.
<EOS>
but
the
reason
why
we
meddle
as
little
with
english
vessel
as
we
could
,
be
,
first
,
because
,
if
they
be
ship
of
any
force
,
we
be
sure
of
more
resistance
from
them
;
and
,
secondly
,
because
we
find
the
english
ship
have
less
booty
when
take
,
for
the
Spaniards
generally
have
money
on
board
,
and
that
be
what
we
best
know
what
to
do
with
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wilmot
be
,
indeed
,
more
particularly
cruel
when
he
take
any
english
vessel
,
that
they
may
not
too
soon
have
advice
of
him
in
England
;
and
so
the
man
-
of
-
war
have
order
to
look
out
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
this
part
I
bury
in
silence
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
We
increase
our
stock
in
these
two
year
considerably
,
have
take
60,000
piece
of
eight
in
one
vessel
,
and
100,000
in
another
;
and
be
thus
first
grow
rich
,
we
resolve
to
be
strong
too
,
for
we
have
take
a
brigantine
build
at
Virginia
,
an
excellent
sea
-
boat
,
and
a
good
sailer
,
and
able
to
carry
twelve
gun
;
and
a
large
spanish
frigate
-
build
ship
,
that
sail
incomparably
well
also
,
and
which
afterwards
,
by
the
help
of
good
carpenter
,
we
fit
up
to
carry
twenty
-
eight
gun
.
<EOS>
and
now
we
want
more
hand
,
so
we
put
away
for
the
Bay
of
Campeachy
,
not
doubt
we
should
ship
as
many
man
there
as
we
please
;
and
so
we
do
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
sell
the
sloop
that
I
be
in
;
and
Captain
Wilmot
keep
his
own
ship
,
I
take
the
command
of
the
spanish
frigate
as
captain
,
and
my
comrade
Harris
as
eld
lieutenant
,
and
a
bold
enterprising
fellow
he
be
,
as
any
the
world
afford
.
<EOS>
one
culverdine
be
put
into
the
brigantine
,
so
that
we
be
now
three
stout
ship
,
well
man
,
and
victual
for
twelve
month
;
for
we
have
take
two
or
three
sloop
from
New
England
and
New
York
,
laden
with
flour
,
pea
,
and
barrel
beef
and
pork
,
go
for
Jamaica
and
Barbados
;
and
for
more
beef
we
go
on
shore
on
the
island
of
Cuba
,
where
we
kill
as
many
black
cattle
as
we
please
,
though
we
have
very
little
salt
to
cure
them
.
  
<EOS>
out
of
all
the
prize
we
take
here
<EOS>
we
take
their
powder
and
bullet
,
their
small
-
arm
and
cutlass
;
and
as
for
their
man
,
we
always
take
the
surgeon
and
the
carpenter
,
as
person
who
be
of
particular
use
to
us
upon
many
occasion
;
nor
be
they
always
unwilling
to
go
with
us
,
though
for
their
own
security
,
in
case
of
accident
,
they
may
easily
pretend
they
be
carry
away
by
force
;
of
which
I
shall
give
a
pleasant
account
in
the
course
of
my
other
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
one
very
merry
fellow
here
,
a
Quaker
,
whose
name
be
William
Walters
,
whom
we
take
out
of
a
sloop
bind
from
Pennsylvania
to
Barbados
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
surgeon
,
and
they
call
him
doctor
;
but
he
be
not
employ
in
the
sloop
as
a
surgeon
,
but
be
go
to
Barbados
to
get
a
berth
,
as
the
sailor
call
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
all
his
surgeon
's
chest
on
board
,
and
we
make
him
go
with
us
,
and
take
all
his
implement
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
comic
fellow
indeed
,
a
man
of
very
good
solid
sense
,
and
an
excellent
surgeon
;
but
,
what
be
worth
all
,
very
good
-
humoured
and
pleasant
in
his
conversation
,
and
a
bold
,
stout
,
brave
fellow
too
,
as
any
we
have
among
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
William
,
as
I
think
,
not
very
averse
to
go
along
with
us
,
and
yet
resolve
to
do
it
so
that
it
may
be
apparent
he
be
take
away
by
force
,
and
to
this
purpose
he
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
thou
sayest
<EOS>
I
must
go
with
thee
,
and
it
be
not
in
my
power
to
resist
thee
if
I
would
;
but
<EOS>
I
desire
thou
wilt
oblige
the
master
of
the
sloop
which
I
be
on
board
to
certify
under
his
hand
,
that
I
be
take
away
by
force
and
against
my
will
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
he
say
with
so
much
satisfaction
in
his
face
,
that
I
could
not
but
understand
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
"
say
I
,
"
whether
it
be
against
your
will
or
no
,
I
will
make
him
and
all
the
man
give
you
a
certificate
of
it
,
or
I
will
take
them
all
along
with
us
,
and
keep
them
till
they
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
draw
up
a
certificate
myself
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
write
that
he
be
take
away
by
main
force
,
as
a
prisoner
,
by
a
pirate
ship
;
that
they
carry
away
his
chest
and
instrument
first
,
and
then
bind
his
hand
behind
him
and
force
him
into
their
boat
;
and
this
be
sign
by
the
master
and
all
his
man
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
fall
a
-
swearing
at
him
,
and
call
to
my
man
to
tie
his
hand
behind
him
,
and
so
we
put
him
into
our
boat
and
carry
him
away
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
him
on
board
,
I
call
him
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
bring
you
away
by
force
,
it
be
true
,
but
I
be
not
of
the
opinion
I
have
bring
you
away
so
much
against
your
will
as
they
imagine
.
<EOS>
come
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
will
be
a
useful
man
to
us
,
and
you
shall
have
very
good
usage
among
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
unbind
his
hand
,
and
first
order
all
thing
that
belong
to
him
to
be
restore
to
him
,
and
our
captain
give
him
a
dram
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
hast
deal
friendly
by
me
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
I
will
be
plain
with
thee
,
whether
I
come
willingly
to
thee
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
shall
make
myself
as
useful
to
thee
as
I
can
,
but
thou
knowest
<EOS>
it
be
not
my
business
to
meddle
when
thou
art
to
fight
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
the
captain
,
"
but
you
may
meddle
a
little
when
we
share
the
money
.
"
<EOS>
"
those
thing
be
useful
to
furnish
a
surgeon
's
chest
,
"
say
William
,
and
smile
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
moderate
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
William
be
a
most
agreeable
companion
;
but
he
have
the
well
of
us
in
this
part
,
that
if
we
be
take
we
be
sure
to
be
hang
,
and
he
be
sure
to
escape
;
and
he
know
it
well
enough
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
short
,
he
be
a
sprightly
fellow
,
and
fitter
to
be
captain
than
any
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
often
an
occasion
to
speak
of
him
in
the
rest
of
the
story
.
  
<EOS>
Our
cruise
so
long
in
these
sea
begin
now
to
be
so
well
know
,
that
not
in
England
only
,
but
in
France
and
Spain
,
account
have
be
make
public
of
our
adventure
,
and
many
story
tell
how
we
murder
the
people
in
cold
blood
,
tie
them
back
to
back
,
and
throw
them
into
the
sea
;
one
half
of
which
,
however
,
be
not
true
,
though
more
be
do
than
be
fit
to
speak
of
here
.
  
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
,
however
,
be
,
that
several
english
man
-
of
-
war
be
send
to
the
West
Indies
,
and
be
particularly
instruct
to
cruise
in
the
Bay
of
Mexico
,
and
the
Gulf
of
Florida
,
and
among
the
Bahama
island
,
if
possible
,
to
attack
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
so
ignorant
of
thing
as
not
to
expect
this
,
after
so
long
a
stay
in
that
part
of
the
world
;
but
the
first
certain
account
we
have
of
them
be
at
Honduras
,
when
a
vessel
come
in
from
Jamaica
tell
us
that
two
english
man
-
of
-
war
be
come
directly
from
Jamaica
thither
in
quest
of
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
indeed
as
it
be
embaye
,
and
could
not
have
make
the
least
shift
to
have
get
off
,
if
they
have
come
directly
to
us
;
but
,
as
it
happen
,
somebody
have
inform
them
that
we
be
in
the
Bay
of
Campeachy
,
and
they
go
directly
thither
,
by
which
we
be
not
only
free
of
them
,
but
be
so
much
to
the
windward
of
them
,
that
they
could
not
make
any
attempt
upon
us
,
though
they
have
know
we
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
this
advantage
,
and
stand
away
for
Carthagena
,
and
from
thence
with
great
difficulty
beat
it
up
at
a
distance
from
under
the
shore
for
St.
Martha
,
till
we
come
to
the
dutch
island
of
Curacoa
,
and
from
thence
to
the
island
of
Tobago
,
which
,
as
before
,
be
our
rendezvous
;
which
,
be
a
desert
,
uninhabited
island
,
we
at
the
same
time
make
use
of
for
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
here
the
captain
of
the
brigantine
die
,
and
Captain
Harris
,
at
that
time
my
lieutenant
,
take
the
command
of
the
brigantine
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
come
to
a
resolution
to
go
away
to
the
coast
of
Brazil
,
and
from
thence
to
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
and
so
for
the
East
Indies
;
but
Captain
Harris
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
now
captain
of
the
brigantine
,
allege
that
his
ship
be
too
small
for
so
long
a
voyage
,
but
that
,
if
Captain
Wilmot
would
consent
,
he
would
take
the
hazard
of
another
cruise
,
and
he
would
follow
us
in
the
first
ship
he
could
take
.
<EOS>
so
we
appoint
our
rendezvous
to
be
at
Madagascar
,
which
be
do
by
my
recommendation
of
the
place
,
and
the
plenty
of
provision
to
be
have
there
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
go
away
from
us
in
an
evil
hour
;
for
,
instead
of
take
a
ship
to
follow
us
,
he
be
take
,
as
I
hear
afterwards
,
by
an
english
man
-
of
-
war
,
and
be
lay
in
iron
,
die
of
mere
grief
and
anger
before
he
come
to
England
.
<EOS>
His
lieutenant
,
I
have
hear
,
be
afterwards
execute
in
England
for
a
pirate
;
and
this
be
the
end
of
the
man
who
first
bring
me
into
this
unhappy
trade
.
  
<EOS>
We
part
from
Tobago
three
day
after
,
bend
our
course
for
the
coast
of
Brazil
,
but
have
not
be
at
sea
above
twenty
-
four
hour
,
when
we
be
separate
by
a
terrible
storm
,
which
hold
three
day
,
with
very
little
abatement
or
intermission
.
<EOS>
in
this
juncture
Captain
Wilmot
happen
,
unluckily
,
to
be
on
board
my
ship
,
to
his
great
mortification
;
for
we
not
only
lose
sight
of
his
ship
,
but
never
see
her
more
till
we
come
to
Madagascar
,
where
she
be
cast
away
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
after
have
in
this
temp
lose
our
fore
-
topmast
,
we
be
force
to
put
back
to
the
isle
of
Tobago
for
shelter
,
and
to
repair
our
damage
,
which
bring
us
all
very
near
our
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
no
sooner
on
shore
here
,
and
all
very
busy
look
out
for
a
piece
of
timber
for
a
topmast
,
but
we
perceive
stand
in
for
the
shore
an
english
man
-
of
-
war
of
thirty
-
six
gun
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
surprise
to
us
indeed
,
because
we
be
disabled
so
much
;
but
,
to
our
great
good
fortune
,
we
lay
pretty
snug
and
close
among
the
high
rock
,
and
the
man
-
of
-
war
do
not
see
us
,
but
stand
off
again
upon
his
cruise
.
<EOS>
so
we
only
observe
which
way
she
go
,
and
at
night
,
leave
our
work
,
resolve
to
stand
off
to
sea
,
steer
the
contrary
way
from
that
which
we
observe
she
go
;
and
this
,
we
find
,
have
the
desire
success
,
for
we
see
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
We
have
get
an
old
mizzen
-
topmast
on
board
,
which
make
us
a
jury
<EOS>
fore
-
topmast
for
the
present
;
and
so
we
stand
away
for
the
isle
of
Trinidad
,
where
,
though
there
be
Spaniards
on
shore
,
yet
we
land
some
man
with
our
boat
,
and
cut
a
very
good
piece
of
fir
to
make
us
a
new
topmast
,
which
we
get
fit
up
effectually
;
and
also
we
get
some
cattle
here
to
eke
out
our
provision
;
and
call
a
council
of
war
among
ourselves
,
we
resolve
to
quit
those
sea
for
the
present
,
and
steer
away
for
the
coast
of
Brazil
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
we
attempt
here
be
only
get
fresh
water
,
but
we
learn
that
there
lie
the
portuguese
fleet
at
the
bay
of
All
Saints
,
bind
for
Lisbon
,
ready
to
sail
,
and
only
wait
for
a
fair
wind
.
<EOS>
this
make
us
lie
by
,
wish
to
see
them
put
to
sea
,
and
,
accordingly
as
they
be
with
or
without
convoy
,
to
attack
or
avoid
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
spring
up
a
fresh
gale
in
the
evening
at
S.W.
by
W.
,
which
,
be
fair
for
the
Portugal
fleet
,
and
the
weather
pleasant
and
agreeable
,
we
hear
the
signal
give
to
unmoor
,
and
run
in
under
the
island
of
Si
#
#
#
#
,
we
haul
our
mainsail
and
foresail
up
in
the
brail
,
lower
the
topsail
upon
the
cap
,
and
clew
them
up
,
that
we
may
lie
as
snug
as
we
could
,
expect
their
come
out
,
and
the
next
morning
see
the
whole
fleet
come
out
accordingly
,
but
not
at
all
to
our
satisfaction
,
for
they
consist
of
twenty
-
six
sail
,
and
most
of
them
ship
of
force
,
as
well
as
burthen
,
both
merchantman
and
man
-
of
-
war
;
so
,
see
there
be
no
meddling
,
we
lay
still
where
we
be
also
,
till
the
fleet
be
out
of
sight
,
and
then
stand
off
and
on
,
in
hope
of
meet
with
further
purchase
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
we
see
a
sail
,
and
immediately
give
her
chase
;
but
she
prove
an
excellent
sailer
,
and
,
stand
out
to
sea
<EOS>
,
we
see
plainly
she
trust
to
her
heel
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
to
her
sail
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
we
be
a
clean
ship
,
we
gain
upon
her
,
though
slowly
,
and
have
we
have
a
day
before
us
<EOS>
,
we
should
certainly
have
come
up
with
her
;
but
it
grow
dark
apace
,
and
in
that
case
we
know
we
should
lose
sight
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
Our
merry
Quaker
,
perceive
us
to
crowd
still
after
her
in
the
dark
,
wherein
we
could
not
see
which
way
she
go
,
come
very
dryly
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Friend
Singleton
,
"
say
he
,
"
dost
thee
know
what
we
be
a
-
doing
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
yes
;
why
,
we
be
chase
yon
ship
,
be
we
not
?
"
<EOS>
"
and
how
dost
thou
know
that
?
"
say
he
,
very
gravely
still
.
<EOS>
"
nay
,
that
be
true
,
"
say
I
again
;
"
we
can
not
be
sure
.
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
think
we
may
be
sure
that
we
be
run
away
from
her
,
not
chase
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
,
"
add
he
,
"
thou
art
turn
Quaker
,
and
hast
resolve
not
to
use
the
hand
of
power
,
or
art
a
coward
,
and
art
fly
from
thy
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
say
I
(
I
think
I
swear
at
him
)
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
sneer
at
now
?
<EOS>
You
have
always
one
dry
rub
or
another
to
give
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
plain
enough
the
ship
stand
off
to
sea
due
east
,
on
purpose
to
lose
us
,
and
thou
mayest
be
sure
her
business
do
not
lie
that
way
;
for
what
should
she
do
at
the
coast
of
Africa
in
this
latitude
,
which
should
be
as
far
south
as
Congo
or
Angola
?
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
it
be
dark
,
that
we
would
lose
sight
of
her
,
she
will
tack
and
stand
away
west
again
for
the
Brazil
coast
and
for
the
bay
,
where
thou
knowest
she
be
go
before
;
and
be
we
not
,
then
,
run
away
from
her
?
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
in
hope
,
friend
,
"
say
the
dry
,
gibe
creature
,
"
<EOS>
thou
wilt
turn
Quaker
,
for
I
see
thou
art
not
for
fighting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
William
,
"
say
I
;
"
then
I
shall
make
an
excellent
pirate
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
William
be
in
the
right
,
and
I
apprehend
what
he
mean
immediately
;
and
Captain
Wilmot
,
who
lie
very
sick
in
his
cabin
,
overhear
us
,
understand
him
as
well
as
I
,
and
call
out
to
me
that
William
be
right
,
and
it
be
our
good
way
to
change
our
course
,
and
stand
away
for
the
bay
,
where
it
be
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
we
should
snap
her
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
we
go
about
-
ship
,
get
our
larboard
tack
on
board
,
set
the
top
-
gallant
sail
,
and
crowd
for
the
bay
of
All
Saints
,
where
we
come
to
an
anchor
early
in
the
morning
,
just
out
of
gunshot
of
the
fort
;
we
furl
our
sail
with
rope
-
yarn
,
that
we
may
haul
home
the
sheet
without
go
up
to
loose
them
,
and
,
lower
our
main
and
fore
-
yard
,
look
just
as
if
we
have
lain
there
a
good
while
.
  
<EOS>
in
two
hour
afterwards
we
see
our
game
stand
in
for
the
bay
with
all
the
sail
she
could
make
,
and
she
come
innocently
into
our
very
mouth
,
for
we
lay
still
till
we
see
her
almost
within
gunshot
,
when
,
our
foremost
gear
be
stretch
fore
and
aft
,
we
first
run
up
our
yard
,
and
then
haul
home
the
topsail
sheet
,
the
rope
-
yarn
that
furl
them
give
way
of
themselves
;
the
sail
be
set
in
a
few
minute
;
at
the
same
time
slip
our
cable
,
we
come
upon
her
before
she
could
get
under
way
upon
the
other
tack
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
surprised
that
they
make
little
or
no
resistance
,
but
strike
after
the
first
broadside
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
consider
what
to
do
with
her
,
when
William
come
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Hark
thee
,
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
thou
hast
make
a
fine
piece
of
work
of
it
now
,
hast
thou
not
,
to
borrow
thy
neighbour
's
ship
here
just
at
thy
neighbour
's
door
,
and
never
ask
him
leave
?
<EOS>
now
,
dost
thou
not
think
there
be
some
man
-
of
-
war
in
the
port
?
<EOS>
Thou
hast
give
them
the
alarm
sufficiently
<EOS>
;
thou
wilt
have
them
upon
thy
back
before
night
,
depend
upon
it
,
to
ask
thee
wherefore
thou
didst
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
truly
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
for
aught
I
know
,
that
may
be
true
;
what
,
then
,
shall
we
do
next
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
"
Thou
hast
but
two
thing
to
do
:
either
to
go
in
and
take
all
the
rest
,
or
else
get
thee
go
before
they
come
out
and
take
thee
;
for
I
see
they
be
hoist
a
topmast
to
yon
great
ship
,
in
order
to
put
to
sea
immediately
,
and
they
will
not
be
long
before
they
come
to
talk
with
thee
,
and
what
wilt
<EOS>
thou
say
to
them
when
they
ask
thee
why
thou
borrowedst
their
ship
without
leave
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
William
say
,
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
We
could
see
by
our
glass
they
be
all
in
a
hurry
,
man
and
fit
some
sloop
they
have
there
,
and
a
large
man
-
of
-
war
,
and
it
be
plain
they
would
soon
be
with
us
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
not
at
a
loss
what
to
do
;
we
find
the
ship
we
have
take
be
laden
with
nothing
considerable
for
our
purpose
,
except
some
cocoa
,
some
sugar
,
and
twenty
barrel
of
flour
;
the
rest
of
her
cargo
be
hide
;
so
we
take
out
all
we
think
fit
for
our
turn
,
and
,
among
the
rest
,
all
her
ammunition
,
great
shot
,
and
small
-
arm
,
and
turn
her
off
.
<EOS>
We
also
take
a
cable
and
three
anchor
she
have
,
which
be
for
our
purpose
,
and
some
of
her
sail
.
<EOS>
She
have
enough
leave
just
to
carry
her
into
port
,
and
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
have
do
this
,
we
stand
on
upon
the
Brazil
coast
,
southward
,
till
we
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
Janeiro
.
<EOS>
but
as
we
have
two
day
the
wind
blow
hard
at
S.E.
and
S.S.E.
,
we
be
oblige
to
come
to
an
anchor
under
a
little
island
,
and
wait
for
a
wind
.
<EOS>
in
this
time
the
Portuguese
have
,
it
seem
,
give
notice
over
land
to
the
governor
there
,
that
a
pirate
be
upon
the
coast
;
so
that
,
when
we
come
in
view
of
the
port
,
we
see
two
man
-
of
-
war
ride
just
without
the
bar
,
whereof
one
<EOS>
,
we
find
,
be
get
under
sail
with
all
possible
speed
,
have
slip
her
cable
on
purpose
to
speak
with
us
;
the
other
be
not
so
forward
,
but
be
prepare
to
follow
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
an
hour
they
stand
both
fair
after
us
,
with
all
the
sail
they
could
make
.
  
<EOS>
have
not
the
night
come
on
,
William
's
word
have
be
make
good
;
they
would
certainly
have
ask
us
the
question
what
we
do
there
,
for
we
find
the
foremost
ship
gain
upon
us
,
especially
upon
one
tack
,
for
we
ply
away
from
them
to
windward
;
but
in
the
dark
lose
sight
of
them
,
we
resolve
to
change
our
course
and
stand
away
directly
for
sea
,
not
doubt
that
we
should
lose
them
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
portuguese
commander
guess
we
would
do
so
or
no
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
;
but
in
the
morning
,
when
the
daylight
appear
,
instead
of
have
lose
him
,
we
find
him
in
chase
of
us
about
a
league
astern
;
only
,
to
our
great
good
fortune
,
we
could
see
but
one
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
one
be
a
great
ship
,
carry
six
-
and
-
forty
gun
,
and
an
admirable
sailer
,
as
appear
by
her
outsail
us
;
for
our
ship
be
an
excellent
sailer
too
,
as
I
have
say
before
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
find
this
,
I
easily
see
there
be
no
remedy
,
but
we
must
engage
;
and
as
we
know
we
could
expect
no
quarter
from
those
scoundrel
the
Portuguese
,
a
nation
<EOS>
I
have
an
original
aversion
to
,
I
let
Captain
Wilmot
know
how
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
sick
as
he
be
,
jump
up
in
the
cabin
,
and
would
be
lead
out
upon
the
deck
(
for
he
be
very
weak
)
to
see
how
it
be
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
will
fight
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
Our
man
be
all
in
good
heart
before
,
but
to
see
the
captain
so
brisk
,
who
have
lie
ill
of
a
calenture
ten
or
eleven
day
,
give
them
double
courage
,
and
they
go
all
hand
to
work
to
make
a
clear
ship
and
be
ready
.
<EOS>
William
,
the
Quaker
,
come
to
me
with
a
kind
of
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
do
yon
ship
follow
us
for
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
fight
us
,
you
may
be
sure
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
will
he
come
up
with
us
,
dost
thou
think
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
see
she
will
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
friend
,
"
say
the
dry
wretch
,
"
why
dost
thou
run
from
her
still
,
when
thou
seest
she
will
overtake
thee
?
<EOS>
Will
it
be
well
for
us
to
be
overtake
farther
off
than
here
?
"
<EOS>
"
much
as
one
for
that
,
"
say
I
;
"
why
,
what
would
you
have
us
do
?
"
<EOS>
"
do
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
;
"
let
us
not
give
the
poor
man
more
trouble
than
need
must
;
let
us
stay
for
him
and
hear
what
he
have
to
say
to
us
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
will
talk
to
us
in
powder
and
ball
,
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
that
be
his
country
language
,
we
must
talk
to
him
in
the
same
,
must
we
not
?
<EOS>
or
else
how
shall
he
understand
us
?
"
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
we
understand
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
captain
,
as
ill
as
he
be
,
call
to
me
,
"
William
's
right
again
,
"
say
he
;
"
as
good
here
as
a
league
farther
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
he
give
a
word
of
command
<EOS>
,
"
haul
up
the
main
-
sail
;
we
will
shorten
sail
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
accordingly
we
shorten
sail
,
and
as
we
expect
her
upon
our
lee
-
side
,
we
be
then
upon
our
starboard
tack
,
bring
eighteen
of
our
gun
to
the
larboard
side
,
resolve
to
give
him
a
broadside
that
should
warm
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
half
-
an
-
hour
before
he
come
up
with
us
,
all
which
time
we
luff
up
,
that
we
may
keep
the
wind
of
him
,
by
which
he
be
oblige
to
run
up
under
our
lee
,
as
we
design
him
;
when
we
get
him
upon
our
quarter
,
we
edge
down
,
and
receive
the
fire
of
five
or
six
of
his
gun
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
you
may
be
sure
all
our
hand
be
at
their
quarter
,
so
we
clap
our
helm
hard
a
-
weather
,
let
go
the
lee
-
brace
of
the
maintop
sail
,
and
lay
it
a
-
back
,
and
so
our
ship
fall
athwart
the
portuguese
ship
's
hawse
;
then
we
immediately
pour
in
our
broadside
,
rake
them
fore
and
aft
,
and
kill
them
a
great
many
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
Portuguese
,
we
could
see
,
be
in
the
utmost
confusion
;
and
not
be
aware
of
our
design
,
their
ship
have
fresh
way
,
run
their
bowsprit
into
the
fore
part
of
our
main
shroud
,
as
that
they
could
not
easily
get
clear
of
us
,
and
so
we
lie
lock
after
that
manner
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
could
not
bring
above
five
or
six
gun
,
besides
their
small
-
arm
,
to
bear
upon
us
,
while
we
play
our
whole
broadside
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
heat
of
this
fight
,
as
I
be
very
busy
upon
the
quarter
-
deck
,
the
captain
call
to
me
,
for
he
never
stir
from
us
,
"
what
the
devil
be
friend
William
a
-
do
yonder
?
"
say
the
captain
;
"
have
he
any
business
upon
,
deck
?
<EOS>
"
I
step
forward
,
and
there
be
friend
William
,
with
two
or
three
stout
fellow
,
lash
the
ship
's
bowsprit
fast
to
our
mainmast
,
for
fear
they
should
get
away
from
us
;
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
pull
a
bottle
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
give
the
man
a
dram
to
encourage
them
.
<EOS>
the
shot
fly
about
his
ear
as
thick
as
may
be
suppose
in
such
an
action
,
where
the
Portuguese
,
to
give
them
their
due
,
fight
very
briskly
,
believe
at
first
<EOS>
they
be
sure
of
their
game
,
and
trust
to
their
superiority
;
but
there
be
William
,
as
compose
,
and
in
as
perfect
tranquillity
as
to
danger
,
as
if
he
have
be
over
a
bowl
of
punch
,
only
very
busy
secure
the
matter
,
that
a
ship
of
forty
-
six
gun
should
not
run
away
from
a
ship
of
eight
-
and
-
twenty
.
  
<EOS>
this
work
be
too
hot
to
hold
long
;
our
man
behave
bravely
:
our
gunner
,
a
gallant
man
,
shout
below
,
pour
in
his
shot
at
such
a
rate
,
that
the
Portuguese
begin
to
slacken
their
fire
;
we
have
dismount
several
of
their
gun
by
fire
in
at
their
forecastle
,
and
rake
them
,
as
I
say
,
fore
and
aft
.
<EOS>
presently
come
William
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
friend
,
"
say
he
,
very
calmly
,
"
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
mean
?
<EOS>
why
dost
<EOS>
thou
not
visit
thy
neighbour
in
the
ship
,
the
door
be
open
for
thee
?
<EOS>
"
I
understand
him
immediately
,
for
our
gun
have
so
tear
their
hull
,
that
we
have
beat
two
port
-
hole
into
one
,
and
the
bulk
-
head
of
their
steerage
be
split
to
piece
,
so
that
they
could
not
retire
to
their
close
quarter
;
so
I
give
the
word
immediately
to
board
them
.
<EOS>
Our
second
lieutenant
,
with
about
thirty
man
,
enter
in
an
instant
over
the
forecastle
,
follow
by
some
more
with
the
boatswain
,
and
cut
in
piece
about
twenty
-
five
man
that
they
find
upon
the
deck
,
and
then
throw
some
grenadoe
into
the
steerage
,
they
enter
there
also
;
upon
which
the
Portuguese
cry
quarter
presently
,
and
we
master
the
ship
,
contrary
indeed
to
our
own
expectation
;
for
we
would
have
compound
with
them
if
they
would
have
sheer
off
:
but
lay
them
athwart
the
hawse
at
first
,
and
follow
our
fire
furiously
,
without
give
them
any
time
to
get
clear
of
us
and
work
their
ship
;
by
this
mean
,
though
they
have
six
-
and
-
forty
gun
,
they
be
not
able
to
fight
above
five
or
six
,
as
I
say
above
,
for
we
beat
them
immediately
from
their
gun
in
the
forecastle
,
and
kill
them
abundance
of
man
between
deck
,
so
that
when
we
enter
they
have
hardly
find
man
enough
to
fight
us
hand
to
hand
upon
their
deck
.
  
<EOS>
the
surprise
of
joy
to
hear
the
portuguese
cry
quarter
,
and
see
their
ancient
strike
,
be
so
great
to
our
captain
,
who
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
reduce
very
weak
with
a
high
fever
,
that
it
give
him
new
life
.
<EOS>
nature
conquer
the
distemper
,
and
the
fever
abate
that
very
night
;
so
that
in
two
or
three
day
he
be
sensibly
well
,
his
strength
begin
to
come
,
and
he
be
able
to
give
his
order
effectually
in
everything
that
be
material
,
and
in
about
ten
day
be
entirely
well
and
about
the
ship
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
I
take
possession
of
the
portuguese
man
-
of
-
war
;
and
Captain
Wilmot
make
me
,
or
rather
I
make
myself
,
captain
of
her
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
about
thirty
of
their
seaman
take
service
with
us
,
some
of
which
be
French
,
some
Genoese
;
and
we
set
the
rest
on
shore
the
next
day
on
a
little
island
on
the
coast
of
Brazil
,
except
some
wound
man
,
who
be
not
in
a
condition
to
be
remove
,
and
whom
we
be
bind
to
keep
on
board
;
but
we
have
an
occasion
afterwards
to
dispose
of
them
at
the
Cape
,
where
,
at
their
own
request
,
we
set
them
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wilmot
,
as
soon
as
the
ship
be
take
,
and
the
prisoner
stow
,
be
for
stand
in
for
the
river
Janeiro
again
,
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
we
should
meet
with
the
other
man
-
of
-
war
,
who
,
not
have
be
able
to
find
us
,
and
have
lose
the
company
of
her
comrade
,
would
certainly
be
return
,
and
may
be
surprise
by
the
ship
we
have
take
,
if
we
carry
portuguese
colour
;
and
our
man
be
all
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
friend
William
give
us
well
counsel
,
for
he
come
to
me
,
"
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
understand
the
captain
be
for
sailing
back
to
the
Rio
Janeiro
,
in
hope
to
meet
with
the
other
ship
that
be
in
chase
of
thee
yesterday
.
<EOS>
be
it
true
,
dost
thou
intend
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
"
say
I
,
"
William
,
pray
why
not
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
thou
mayest
do
so
if
thou
wilt
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
know
that
too
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
the
captain
be
a
man
will
be
rule
by
reason
;
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
William
gravely
,
"
I
only
ask
what
be
thy
business
,
and
the
business
of
all
the
people
thou
hast
with
thee
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
to
get
money
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
William
,
it
be
so
,
in
our
honest
way
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
wouldest
thou
,
"
say
he
,
"
rather
have
money
without
fight
,
or
fight
without
money
?
<EOS>
I
mean
which
wouldest
thou
have
by
choice
,
suppose
it
to
be
leave
to
thee
?
"
<EOS>
"
O
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
first
of
the
two
,
to
be
sure
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
what
great
gain
hast
thou
make
of
the
prize
thou
hast
take
now
,
though
it
have
cost
the
life
of
thirteen
of
thy
man
,
besides
some
hurt
?
<EOS>
It
be
true
thou
hast
get
the
ship
and
some
prisoner
;
but
thou
wouldest
have
have
twice
the
booty
in
a
merchant
-
ship
,
with
not
one
quarter
of
the
fighting
;
and
how
dost
thou
know
<EOS>
either
what
force
or
<EOS>
what
number
of
man
may
be
in
the
other
ship
,
and
what
loss
thou
mayest
suffer
,
and
what
gain
it
shall
be
to
thee
if
thou
take
her
?
<EOS>
I
think
,
indeed
,
thou
mayest
much
better
let
her
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
William
,
it
be
true
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
I
will
go
tell
the
captain
what
your
opinion
be
,
and
bring
you
word
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
accordingly
in
I
go
to
the
captain
and
tell
him
William
's
reason
;
and
the
captain
be
of
his
mind
,
that
our
business
be
indeed
fight
when
we
could
not
help
it
,
but
that
our
main
affair
be
money
,
and
that
with
as
few
blow
as
we
could
.
<EOS>
so
that
adventure
be
lay
aside
,
and
we
stand
along
shore
again
south
for
the
river
De
la
Plata
,
expect
some
purchase
thereabout
;
especially
we
have
our
eye
upon
some
of
the
spanish
ship
from
Buenos
Ayres
,
which
be
generally
very
rich
in
silver
,
and
one
such
prize
would
have
do
our
business
.
<EOS>
We
ply
about
here
,
in
the
latitude
of
#
#
#
#
south
,
for
near
a
month
,
and
nothing
offer
;
and
here
we
begin
to
consult
what
we
should
do
next
,
for
we
have
come
to
no
resolution
yet
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
design
be
always
for
the
Cape
de
Bona
Speranza
,
and
so
to
the
East
Indies
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
some
flaming
story
of
Captain
Avery
,
and
the
fine
thing
he
have
do
in
the
Indies
,
which
be
double
and
double
,
even
ten
thousand
fold
;
and
from
take
a
great
prize
in
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
where
he
take
a
lady
,
say
to
be
the
Great
Mogul
's
daughter
,
with
a
great
quantity
of
jewel
about
her
,
we
have
a
story
tell
us
,
that
he
take
a
Mogul
ship
,
so
the
foolish
sailor
call
it
,
laden
with
diamond
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
have
<EOS>
friend
William
's
advice
whither
we
should
go
,
but
he
always
put
it
off
with
some
quake
quibble
or
other
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
do
not
care
for
direct
us
neither
;
whether
he
make
a
piece
of
conscience
of
it
,
or
whether
he
do
not
care
to
venture
have
it
come
against
him
afterwards
or
no
,
this
I
know
not
;
but
we
conclude
at
last
without
him
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
,
however
,
pretty
long
in
resolve
,
and
hanker
about
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
at
last
we
spy
a
sail
to
windward
,
and
it
be
such
a
sail
as
I
believe
have
not
be
see
in
that
part
of
the
world
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
It
want
not
that
we
should
give
it
chase
,
for
it
stand
directly
towards
us
,
as
well
as
they
that
steer
could
make
it
;
and
even
that
be
more
accident
of
weather
than
anything
else
,
for
if
the
wind
have
chop
about
anywhere
they
must
have
go
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
leave
any
man
that
be
a
sailor
,
or
understand
anything
of
a
ship
,
to
judge
what
a
figure
this
ship
make
when
we
first
see
her
,
and
what
we
could
imagine
be
the
matter
with
her
.
<EOS>
Her
maintop
-
mast
be
come
by
the
board
about
six
foot
above
the
cap
,
and
fall
forward
,
the
head
of
the
topgallant
-
mast
hanging
in
the
fore
-
shrouds
by
the
stay
;
at
the
same
time
the
parrel
of
the
mizzen
-
topsail
-
yard
by
some
accident
give
way
,
the
mizzen
-
topsail
-
brace
(
the
stand
part
of
which
be
fast
to
the
main
-
topsail
shroud
)
bring
the
mizzen
-
topsail
,
yard
and
all
,
down
with
it
,
which
spread
over
part
of
the
quarter
-
deck
like
an
awning
;
the
fore
-
topsail
be
hoist
up
two
-
third
of
the
mast
,
but
the
sheet
be
fly
;
the
fore
-
yard
be
lower
down
upon
the
forecastle
,
the
sail
loose
,
and
part
of
it
hang
overboard
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
she
come
down
upon
us
with
the
wind
quarter
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
figure
the
whole
ship
make
be
the
most
confound
to
man
that
understand
the
sea
that
ever
be
see
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
boat
,
neither
have
she
any
colour
out
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
near
to
her
,
we
fire
a
gun
to
bring
her
to
.
<EOS>
She
take
no
notice
of
it
,
nor
of
us
,
but
come
on
just
as
she
do
before
.
<EOS>
We
fire
again
,
but
it
be
all
one
.
<EOS>
at
length
we
come
within
pistol
-
shot
of
one
another
,
but
nobody
answer
nor
appear
;
so
we
begin
to
think
that
it
be
a
ship
go
ashore
somewhere
in
distress
,
and
the
man
have
forsake
her
,
the
high
tide
have
float
her
off
to
sea
.
<EOS>
come
nearer
to
her
,
we
run
up
alongside
of
her
so
close
that
we
could
hear
a
noise
within
her
,
and
see
the
motion
of
several
people
through
her
port
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
we
man
out
two
boat
full
of
man
,
and
very
well
armed
,
and
order
them
to
board
her
at
the
same
minute
,
as
near
as
they
could
,
and
to
enter
one
at
her
fore
-
chain
on
the
one
side
,
and
the
other
amidship
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
come
to
the
ship
's
side
,
a
surprising
multitude
of
black
sailor
,
such
as
they
be
,
appear
upon
deck
,
and
,
in
short
,
terrify
our
man
so
much
that
the
boat
which
be
to
enter
her
man
in
the
waist
stand
off
again
,
and
durst
not
board
her
;
and
the
man
that
enter
out
of
the
other
boat
,
find
the
first
boat
,
as
they
think
,
beat
off
,
and
see
the
ship
full
of
man
,
jump
all
back
again
into
their
boat
,
and
put
off
,
not
know
what
the
matter
be
.
<EOS>
upon
this
we
prepare
to
pour
in
a
broadside
upon
her
;
but
our
friend
William
set
us
to
right
again
here
<EOS>
;
for
it
seem
he
guess
how
it
be
soon
than
we
do
,
and
come
up
to
me
(
for
it
be
our
ship
that
come
up
with
her
)
,
"
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
of
opinion
that
thou
art
wrong
in
this
matter
,
and
thy
man
have
be
wrong
also
in
their
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
thee
how
thou
shalt
take
this
ship
,
without
make
use
of
those
thing
call
gun
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
can
that
be
,
William
?
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
thou
mayest
take
her
with
thy
helm
;
thou
seest
they
keep
no
steerage
,
and
thou
seest
the
condition
they
be
in
;
board
her
with
thy
ship
upon
her
lee
quarter
,
and
so
enter
her
from
the
ship
.
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
thou
wilt
<EOS>
take
her
without
fighting
,
for
there
be
some
mischief
<EOS>
have
befall
the
ship
,
which
we
know
nothing
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
it
be
a
smooth
sea
,
and
little
wind
<EOS>
,
I
take
his
advice
,
and
lay
her
aboard
.
<EOS>
immediately
our
man
enter
the
ship
,
where
we
find
a
large
ship
,
with
upward
of
600
negro
,
man
and
woman
,
boy
and
girl
,
and
not
one
christian
or
white
man
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
strike
with
horror
at
the
sight
;
for
immediately
I
conclude
,
as
be
partly
the
case
,
that
these
black
devil
have
get
loose
,
have
murder
all
the
white
man
,
and
throw
them
into
the
sea
;
and
I
have
no
sooner
tell
my
mind
to
the
man
,
but
the
thought
so
enrage
them
that
I
have
much
ado
to
keep
my
man
from
cut
them
all
in
piece
.
<EOS>
but
William
,
with
many
persuasion
,
prevail
upon
them
,
by
tell
them
that
it
be
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
,
if
they
be
in
the
negro
'
condition
,
they
would
do
if
they
could
;
and
that
the
negro
have
really
the
high
injustice
do
them
,
to
be
sell
for
slave
without
their
consent
;
and
that
the
law
of
nature
dictate
it
to
them
;
that
they
ought
not
to
kill
them
,
and
that
it
would
be
wilful
murder
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
prevail
with
them
,
and
cool
their
first
heat
;
so
they
only
knock
down
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
,
and
the
rest
run
all
down
between
deck
to
their
first
place
,
believe
,
as
we
fancy
,
that
we
be
their
first
master
come
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
most
unaccountable
difficulty
we
have
next
;
for
we
could
not
make
them
understand
one
word
we
say
,
nor
could
we
understand
one
word
ourselves
that
they
say
.
<EOS>
We
endeavour
by
sign
to
ask
them
whence
they
come
;
but
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
point
to
the
great
cabin
,
to
the
round
-
house
,
to
the
cook
-
room
,
then
to
our
face
,
to
ask
if
they
have
no
white
man
on
board
,
and
where
they
be
go
;
but
they
could
not
understand
what
we
mean
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
they
point
to
our
boat
and
to
their
ship
,
ask
question
as
well
as
they
could
,
and
say
a
thousand
thing
,
and
express
themselves
with
great
earnestness
;
but
we
could
not
understand
a
word
of
it
all
,
or
know
what
they
mean
by
any
of
their
sign
.
  
<EOS>
We
know
very
well
they
must
have
be
take
on
board
the
ship
as
slave
,
and
that
it
must
be
by
some
european
people
too
.
<EOS>
We
could
easily
see
that
the
ship
be
a
Dutch
-
build
ship
,
but
very
much
altered
,
have
be
build
upon
,
and
,
as
we
suppose
,
in
France
;
for
we
find
two
or
three
french
book
on
board
,
and
afterwards
we
find
clothe
,
linen
,
lace
,
some
old
shoe
,
and
several
other
thing
.
<EOS>
We
find
among
the
provision
some
barrel
of
irish
beef
,
some
Newfoundland
fish
,
and
several
other
evidence
that
there
have
be
Christians
on
board
,
but
see
no
remain
of
them
.
<EOS>
We
find
not
a
sword
,
gun
,
pistol
,
or
weapon
of
any
kind
,
except
some
cutlass
;
and
the
negro
have
hide
them
below
where
they
lie
.
<EOS>
We
ask
them
what
be
become
of
all
the
small
-
arm
,
point
to
our
own
and
to
the
place
where
those
belong
to
the
ship
have
hang
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
negro
understand
me
presently
,
and
beckon
to
me
to
come
upon
the
deck
,
where
,
take
my
fuzee
,
which
I
never
let
go
out
of
my
hand
for
some
time
after
we
have
master
the
ship
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
offer
to
take
hold
of
it
<EOS>
,
he
make
the
proper
motion
of
throw
it
into
the
sea
;
by
which
I
understand
,
as
I
do
afterwards
,
that
they
have
throw
all
the
small
-
arm
,
powder
,
shot
,
sword
,
&
c.
,
into
the
sea
,
believe
,
as
I
suppose
,
those
thing
would
kill
them
,
though
the
man
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
understand
this
we
make
no
question
but
that
the
ship
's
crew
,
have
be
surprise
by
these
desperate
rogue
,
have
go
the
same
way
,
and
have
be
throw
overboard
also
.
<EOS>
We
look
all
over
the
ship
to
see
if
we
could
find
any
blood
,
and
we
think
we
do
perceive
some
in
several
place
;
but
the
heat
of
the
sun
,
melt
the
pitch
and
tar
upon
the
deck
,
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
discern
it
exactly
,
except
in
the
round
-
house
,
where
we
plainly
see
that
there
have
be
much
blood
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
scuttle
open
,
by
which
we
suppose
that
the
captain
and
those
that
be
with
him
have
make
their
retreat
into
the
great
cabin
,
or
those
in
the
cabin
have
make
their
escape
up
into
the
round
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
which
confirm
us
most
of
all
in
what
have
happen
be
that
,
upon
further
inquiry
,
we
find
that
there
be
seven
or
eight
of
the
negro
very
much
wound
,
two
or
three
of
them
with
shot
,
whereof
one
have
his
leg
break
and
lie
in
a
miserable
condition
,
the
flesh
be
mortify
,
and
,
as
our
friend
William
say
,
in
two
day
more
he
would
have
die
.
<EOS>
William
be
a
most
dexterous
surgeon
,
and
he
show
it
in
this
cure
;
for
though
all
the
surgeon
we
have
on
board
both
our
ship
(
and
we
have
no
less
than
five
that
call
themselves
<EOS>
breed
surgeon
,
besides
two
or
three
who
be
pretender
or
assistant
)
 
<EOS>
though
all
these
give
their
opinion
that
the
negro
's
leg
must
be
cut
off
,
and
that
his
life
could
not
be
save
without
it
;
that
the
mortification
have
touch
the
marrow
in
the
bone
,
that
the
tendon
be
mortify
,
and
that
he
could
never
have
the
use
of
his
leg
if
it
should
be
cure
,
William
say
nothing
in
general
,
but
that
his
opinion
be
otherwise
,
and
that
he
desire
the
wound
may
be
search
,
and
that
he
would
then
tell
them
further
.
<EOS>
accordingly
he
go
to
work
with
the
leg
;
and
,
as
he
desire
that
he
may
have
some
of
the
surgeon
to
assist
him
,
we
appoint
him
two
of
the
ablest
of
them
to
help
,
and
all
of
them
to
look
on
,
if
they
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
William
go
to
work
his
own
way
,
and
some
of
them
pretend
to
find
fault
at
first
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
proceed
and
search
every
part
of
the
leg
where
he
suspect
the
mortification
have
touch
it
;
in
a
word
,
he
cut
off
a
great
deal
of
mortify
flesh
,
in
all
which
the
poor
fellow
feel
no
pain
.
<EOS>
William
proceed
till
he
bring
the
vessel
which
he
have
cut
to
bleed
,
and
the
man
to
cry
out
;
then
he
reduce
the
splinter
of
the
bone
,
and
,
call
for
help
,
set
it
,
as
we
call
it
,
and
bind
it
up
,
and
lay
the
man
to
rest
,
who
find
himself
much
easy
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
first
open
the
surgeon
begin
to
triumph
;
the
mortification
seem
to
spread
,
and
a
long
red
streak
of
blood
appear
from
the
wound
upwards
to
the
middle
of
the
man
's
thigh
,
and
the
surgeon
tell
me
the
man
would
die
in
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
look
at
it
,
and
find
William
himself
under
some
surprise
;
but
when
I
ask
him
how
long
he
think
the
poor
fellow
could
live
,
he
look
gravely
at
me
,
and
say
,
"
as
long
as
thou
canst
;
I
be
not
at
all
apprehensive
of
his
life
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
I
would
cure
him
,
if
I
could
,
without
make
a
cripple
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
find
he
be
not
just
then
upon
the
operation
as
to
his
leg
,
but
be
mix
up
something
to
give
the
poor
creature
,
to
repel
,
as
I
think
,
the
spread
contagion
,
and
to
abate
or
prevent
any
feverish
temper
that
may
happen
in
the
blood
;
after
which
he
go
to
work
again
,
and
open
the
leg
in
two
place
above
the
wound
,
cut
out
a
great
deal
of
mortify
flesh
,
which
it
seem
be
occasion
by
the
bandage
,
which
have
press
the
part
too
much
;
and
withal
,
the
blood
be
at
the
time
in
a
more
than
common
disposition
to
mortify
,
may
assist
to
spread
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
our
friend
William
conquer
all
this
,
clear
the
spread
mortification
,
and
the
red
streak
go
off
again
,
the
flesh
begin
to
heal
,
and
matter
to
run
;
and
in
a
few
day
the
man
's
spirit
begin
to
recover
,
his
pulse
beat
regular
,
he
have
no
fever
,
and
gather
strength
daily
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
he
be
a
perfect
sound
man
in
about
ten
week
,
and
we
keep
him
amongst
us
,
and
make
him
an
able
seaman
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
ship
:
we
never
could
come
at
a
certain
information
about
it
,
till
some
of
the
negro
which
we
keep
on
board
,
and
whom
we
teach
to
speak
English
,
give
the
account
of
it
afterwards
,
and
this
maim
man
in
particular
.
  
<EOS>
We
inquire
,
by
all
the
sign
and
motion
we
could
imagine
,
what
be
become
of
the
people
,
and
yet
we
could
get
nothing
from
them
.
<EOS>
Our
lieutenant
be
for
torture
some
of
them
to
make
them
confess
,
but
William
oppose
that
vehemently
;
and
when
he
hear
it
be
under
consideration
he
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
make
a
request
to
thee
not
to
put
any
of
these
poor
wretch
to
torment
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
You
see
they
will
not
give
any
account
of
what
be
become
of
the
white
man
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
William
,
"
do
not
say
so
;
I
suppose
they
have
give
thee
a
full
account
of
every
particular
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
so
?
"
say
I
;
"
pray
what
be
we
the
wise
for
all
their
jabbering
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
William
,
"
that
may
be
thy
fault
,
for
aught
I
know
;
thou
wilt
not
punish
the
poor
man
because
they
can
not
speak
English
;
and
perhaps
they
never
hear
a
word
of
English
before
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
may
very
well
suppose
that
they
have
give
thee
a
large
account
of
everything
;
for
thou
seest
with
what
earnestness
,
and
how
long
,
some
of
them
have
talk
to
thee
;
and
if
thou
canst
not
understand
their
language
,
nor
they
thine
,
how
can
they
help
that
?
<EOS>
at
the
good
,
thou
dost
but
suppose
that
they
have
not
tell
thee
the
whole
truth
of
the
story
;
and
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
suppose
they
have
;
and
how
wilt
thou
decide
the
question
,
whether
thou
art
right
or
whether
I
be
right
?
<EOS>
besides
,
what
can
they
say
to
thee
when
thou
askest
them
a
question
upon
the
torture
,
and
at
the
same
time
they
do
not
understand
the
question
,
and
thou
dost
not
know
whether
they
say
ay
or
no
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
compliment
to
my
moderation
to
say
I
be
convince
by
these
reason
;
and
yet
we
have
all
much
ado
to
keep
our
second
lieutenant
from
murder
some
of
them
,
to
make
them
tell
.
<EOS>
what
if
they
have
tell
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
understand
one
word
of
it
;
but
he
would
not
be
persuade
but
that
the
negro
must
needs
understand
him
when
he
ask
them
whether
the
ship
have
any
boat
or
no
,
like
our
,
and
what
be
become
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
remedy
but
<EOS>
to
wait
till
we
make
these
people
understand
English
,
and
to
adjourn
the
story
till
that
time
.
<EOS>
the
case
be
thus
:
where
they
be
take
on
board
the
ship
,
that
we
could
never
understand
,
because
they
never
know
the
english
name
which
we
give
to
those
coast
,
or
what
nation
they
be
who
belong
to
the
ship
,
because
they
know
not
one
tongue
from
another
;
but
thus
far
the
negro
I
examine
,
who
be
the
same
whose
leg
William
have
cure
,
tell
us
,
that
they
do
not
speak
the
same
language
as
we
speak
,
nor
the
same
our
Portuguese
speak
;
so
that
in
all
probability
they
must
be
french
or
dutch
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
tell
us
that
the
white
man
use
them
barbarously
;
that
they
beat
them
unmercifully
<EOS>
;
that
one
of
the
negro
man
have
a
wife
and
two
negro
child
,
one
a
daughter
,
about
sixteen
year
old
;
that
a
white
man
abuse
the
negro
man
's
wife
,
and
afterwards
his
daughter
,
which
,
as
he
say
,
make
all
the
negro
man
mad
;
and
that
the
woman
's
husband
be
in
a
great
rage
;
at
which
the
white
man
be
so
provoke
that
he
threaten
to
kill
him
;
but
,
in
the
night
,
the
negro
man
,
be
loose
,
get
a
great
club
,
by
which
he
make
us
understand
he
mean
a
handspike
,
and
that
when
the
same
Frenchman
(
if
it
be
a
Frenchman
)
come
among
them
again
,
he
begin
again
to
abuse
the
negro
man
's
wife
,
at
which
the
negro
,
take
up
the
handspike
,
knock
his
brain
out
at
one
blow
;
and
then
take
the
key
from
him
with
which
he
usually
unlock
the
handcuff
which
the
negro
be
fetter
with
<EOS>
,
he
set
about
a
hundred
of
them
at
liberty
,
who
,
get
up
upon
the
deck
by
the
same
scuttle
that
the
white
man
come
down
,
and
take
the
man
's
cutlass
who
be
kill
,
and
lay
hold
of
what
come
next
them
,
they
fall
upon
the
man
that
be
upon
the
deck
,
and
kill
them
all
,
and
afterwards
those
they
find
upon
the
forecastle
;
that
the
captain
and
his
other
man
,
who
be
in
the
cabin
and
the
round
-
house
,
defend
themselves
with
great
courage
,
and
shoot
out
at
the
loophole
at
them
,
by
which
he
and
several
other
man
be
wound
,
and
some
kill
;
but
that
they
break
into
the
round
-
house
after
a
long
dispute
,
where
they
kill
two
of
the
white
man
,
but
own
that
the
two
white
man
kill
eleven
of
their
man
before
they
could
break
in
;
and
then
the
rest
,
have
get
down
the
scuttle
into
the
great
cabin
,
wound
three
more
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
that
,
after
this
,
the
gunner
of
the
ship
have
secure
himself
in
the
gun
-
room
,
one
of
his
man
haul
up
the
long
-
boat
close
under
the
stern
,
and
put
into
her
all
the
arm
and
ammunition
they
could
come
at
,
get
all
into
the
boat
,
and
afterwards
take
in
the
captain
,
and
those
that
be
with
him
,
out
of
the
great
cabin
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
all
thus
embark
,
they
resolve
to
lay
the
ship
aboard
again
,
and
try
to
recover
it
.
<EOS>
that
they
board
the
ship
in
a
desperate
manner
,
and
kill
at
first
all
that
stand
in
their
way
;
but
the
negro
be
by
this
time
all
loose
,
and
have
get
some
arm
,
though
they
understand
nothing
of
powder
and
bullet
,
or
gun
,
yet
the
man
could
never
master
them
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
lie
under
the
ship
's
bow
,
and
get
out
all
the
man
they
have
leave
in
the
cook
-
room
,
who
have
maintain
themselves
there
,
notwithstanding
<EOS>
all
the
negro
could
do
,
and
with
their
small
-
arm
kill
between
thirty
and
forty
of
the
negro
,
but
be
at
last
force
to
leave
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
could
give
me
no
account
whereabout
this
be
,
whether
near
the
coast
of
Africa
,
or
far
off
,
or
how
long
it
be
before
the
ship
fall
into
our
hand
;
only
,
in
general
,
it
be
a
great
while
ago
,
as
they
call
it
;
and
,
by
all
we
could
learn
,
it
be
within
two
or
three
day
after
they
have
set
sail
from
the
coast
.
<EOS>
They
tell
us
that
they
have
kill
about
thirty
of
the
white
man
,
have
knock
them
on
the
head
with
crow
and
handspike
,
and
such
thing
as
they
could
get
;
and
one
strong
negro
kill
three
of
them
with
an
iron
crow
,
after
he
be
shoot
twice
through
the
body
;
and
that
he
be
afterwards
shoot
through
the
head
by
the
captain
himself
at
the
door
of
the
round
-
house
,
which
he
have
split
open
with
the
crow
;
and
this
we
suppose
be
the
occasion
of
the
great
quantity
of
blood
which
we
see
at
the
round
-
house
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
negro
tell
us
that
they
throw
all
the
powder
and
shoot
they
could
find
into
the
sea
,
and
they
would
have
throw
the
great
gun
into
the
sea
if
they
could
have
lift
them
.
<EOS>
be
ask
how
they
come
to
have
their
sail
in
such
a
condition
,
his
answer
be
,
"
They
no
understand
;
they
no
know
what
the
sail
do
;
"
that
be
,
they
do
not
so
much
as
know
that
it
be
the
sail
that
make
the
ship
go
,
or
understand
what
they
mean
,
or
what
to
do
with
them
.
<EOS>
when
we
ask
him
whither
they
be
go
,
he
say
they
do
not
know
,
but
believe
they
should
go
home
to
their
own
country
again
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
in
particular
,
what
he
think
we
be
when
we
first
come
up
with
them
?
<EOS>
He
say
they
be
terribly
fright
,
believe
we
be
the
same
white
man
that
have
go
away
in
their
boat
,
and
be
come
again
in
a
great
ship
,
with
the
two
boat
with
them
,
and
expect
they
would
kill
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
account
we
get
out
of
them
,
after
we
have
teach
them
to
speak
English
,
and
to
understand
the
name
and
use
of
the
thing
belong
to
the
ship
which
they
have
occasion
to
speak
of
;
and
we
observe
that
the
fellow
be
too
innocent
to
dissemble
in
their
relation
,
and
that
they
all
agree
in
the
particular
,
and
be
always
in
the
same
story
,
which
confirm
very
much
the
truth
of
what
they
say
.
  
<EOS>
have
take
this
ship
,
our
next
difficulty
be
,
what
to
do
with
the
negro
.
<EOS>
the
Portuguese
in
the
Brazils
would
have
buy
them
all
of
us
,
and
be
glad
of
the
purchase
,
if
we
have
not
show
ourselves
enemy
there
,
and
be
know
for
pirate
;
but
,
as
it
be
,
we
durst
not
go
ashore
anywhere
thereabout
,
or
treat
with
any
of
the
planter
,
because
we
should
raise
the
whole
country
upon
us
;
and
,
if
there
be
any
such
thing
as
man
-
of
-
war
in
any
of
their
port
,
we
should
be
as
sure
to
be
attack
by
them
,
and
by
all
the
force
they
have
by
land
or
sea
.
  
<EOS>
nor
could
we
think
of
any
well
success
if
we
go
northward
to
our
own
plantation
.
<EOS>
one
while
we
determine
to
carry
them
all
away
to
Buenos
Ayres
,
and
sell
them
there
to
the
Spaniards
;
but
they
be
really
too
many
for
them
to
make
use
of
;
and
to
carry
them
round
to
the
South
Seas
,
which
be
the
only
remedy
that
be
leave
,
be
so
far
that
we
should
be
no
way
able
to
subsist
them
for
so
long
a
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
our
old
,
never
-
fail
friend
,
William
,
help
us
out
again
,
as
he
have
often
do
at
a
dead
lift
.
<EOS>
His
proposal
be
this
,
that
he
should
go
as
master
of
the
ship
,
and
about
twenty
man
,
such
as
we
could
best
trust
,
and
attempt
to
trade
privately
,
upon
the
coast
of
Brazil
,
with
the
planter
,
not
at
the
principal
port
,
because
that
would
not
be
admit
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
agree
to
this
,
and
appoint
to
go
away
ourselves
towards
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
,
where
we
have
think
of
go
before
,
and
to
wait
for
him
,
not
there
,
but
at
Port
St
Pedro
,
as
the
Spaniards
call
it
,
lie
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
which
they
call
Rio
Grande
,
and
where
the
Spaniards
have
a
small
fort
and
a
few
people
,
but
we
believe
there
be
nobody
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
take
up
our
station
,
cruise
off
and
on
,
to
see
if
we
could
meet
any
ship
go
to
or
come
from
the
Buenos
Ayres
or
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
;
but
we
meet
with
nothing
worth
notice
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
employ
ourselves
in
thing
necessary
for
our
go
off
to
sea
;
for
we
fill
all
our
water
-
cask
,
and
get
some
fish
for
our
present
use
,
to
spare
as
much
as
possible
our
ship
's
store
.
  
<EOS>
William
,
in
the
meantime
,
go
away
to
the
north
,
and
make
the
land
about
the
Cape
de
St
Thomas
;
and
betwixt
that
and
the
isle
De
Tuberon
he
find
mean
to
trade
with
the
planter
for
all
his
negro
,
as
well
the
woman
as
the
man
,
and
at
a
very
good
price
too
;
for
William
,
who
speak
portuguese
pretty
well
,
tell
them
a
fair
story
enough
,
that
the
ship
be
in
scarcity
of
provision
,
that
they
be
drive
a
great
way
out
of
their
way
,
and
indeed
,
as
we
say
,
out
of
their
knowledge
,
and
that
they
must
go
up
to
the
northward
as
far
as
Jamaica
,
or
sell
there
upon
the
coast
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
plausible
tale
,
and
be
easily
believe
;
and
,
if
you
observe
the
manner
of
the
negro
'
sailing
,
and
what
happen
in
their
voyage
,
be
every
word
of
it
true
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
method
,
and
be
true
to
one
another
,
William
pass
for
what
he
be
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
for
a
very
honest
fellow
;
and
by
the
assistance
of
one
planter
,
who
send
to
some
of
his
neighbour
planter
,
and
manage
the
trade
among
themselves
,
he
get
a
quick
market
;
for
in
less
than
five
week
William
sell
all
his
negro
,
and
at
last
sell
the
ship
itself
,
and
ship
himself
and
his
twenty
man
,
with
two
negro
boy
whom
he
have
leave
,
in
a
sloop
,
one
of
those
which
the
planter
use
to
send
on
board
for
the
negro
.
<EOS>
with
this
sloop
Captain
William
,
as
we
then
call
him
,
come
away
,
and
find
us
at
Port
St
Pedro
,
in
the
latitude
of
32
degree
30
minute
south
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
more
surprising
to
us
than
to
see
a
sloop
come
along
the
coast
,
carry
portuguese
colour
,
and
come
in
directly
to
us
,
after
we
be
assure
he
have
discover
both
our
ship
.
<EOS>
We
fire
a
gun
,
upon
her
near
approach
,
to
bring
her
to
an
anchor
,
but
immediately
she
fire
five
gun
by
way
of
salute
,
and
spread
her
english
ancient
.
<EOS>
then
we
begin
to
guess
it
be
friend
William
,
but
wonder
what
be
the
meaning
of
his
being
in
a
sloop
,
whereas
we
send
him
away
in
a
ship
of
near
300
ton
;
but
he
soon
let
us
into
the
whole
history
of
his
management
,
with
which
we
have
a
great
deal
of
reason
to
be
very
well
satisfied
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
bring
the
sloop
to
an
anchor
,
he
come
aboard
of
my
ship
,
and
there
he
give
us
an
account
how
he
begin
to
trade
by
the
help
of
a
portuguese
planter
,
who
live
near
the
seaside
<EOS>
;
how
he
go
on
shore
and
go
up
to
the
first
house
he
could
see
,
and
ask
the
man
of
the
house
to
sell
him
some
hog
,
pretend
at
first
he
only
stand
in
upon
the
coast
to
take
in
fresh
water
and
buy
some
provision
;
and
the
man
not
only
sell
him
seven
fat
hog
,
but
invite
him
in
,
and
give
him
,
and
five
man
he
have
with
him
,
a
very
good
dinner
;
and
he
invite
the
planter
on
board
his
ship
,
and
,
in
return
for
his
kindness
,
give
him
a
negro
girl
for
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
this
so
oblige
the
planter
that
the
next
morning
he
send
him
on
board
,
in
a
great
luggage
-
boat
,
a
cow
and
two
sheep
,
with
a
chest
of
sweetmeat
and
some
sugar
,
and
a
great
bag
of
tobacco
,
and
invite
Captain
William
on
shore
again
;
that
,
after
this
,
they
grow
from
one
kindness
to
another
;
that
they
begin
to
talk
about
trading
for
some
negro
;
and
William
,
pretend
it
be
to
do
him
service
,
consent
to
sell
him
thirty
negro
for
his
private
use
in
his
plantation
,
for
which
he
give
William
ready
money
in
gold
,
at
the
rate
of
five
-
and
-
thirty
moidore
per
head
;
but
the
planter
be
oblige
to
use
great
caution
in
the
bring
them
on
shore
;
for
which
purpose
he
make
William
weigh
and
stand
out
to
sea
,
and
put
in
again
,
about
fifty
mile
farther
north
,
where
at
a
little
creek
he
take
the
negro
on
shore
at
another
plantation
,
be
a
friend
's
of
his
,
whom
,
it
seem
,
he
could
trust
.
  
<EOS>
this
remove
bring
William
into
a
further
intimacy
,
not
only
with
the
first
planter
,
but
also
with
his
friend
,
who
desire
to
have
some
of
the
negro
also
;
so
that
,
from
one
to
another
,
they
buy
so
many
,
till
one
overgrow
planter
take
100
negro
,
which
be
all
William
have
leave
,
and
share
them
with
another
planter
,
<EOS>
that
other
planter
chaffer
with
William
for
ship
and
all
,
give
him
in
exchange
a
very
clean
,
large
,
well
-
build
sloop
of
near
sixty
ton
,
very
well
furnished
,
carry
six
gun
;
but
we
make
her
afterwards
carry
twelve
gun
.
<EOS>
William
have
300
moidore
of
gold
,
besides
the
sloop
,
in
payment
for
the
ship
;
and
with
this
money
he
store
the
sloop
as
full
as
she
could
hold
with
provision
,
especially
bread
,
some
pork
,
and
about
sixty
hog
alive
;
among
the
rest
,
William
get
eighty
barrel
of
good
gunpowder
,
which
be
very
much
for
our
purpose
;
and
all
the
provision
which
be
in
the
french
ship
he
take
out
also
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
agreeable
account
to
us
,
especially
when
we
see
that
William
have
receive
in
gold
coin
,
or
by
weight
,
and
some
spanish
silver
,
60,000
piece
of
eight
,
besides
a
new
sloop
,
and
a
vast
quantity
of
provision
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
very
glad
of
the
sloop
in
particular
,
and
begin
to
consult
what
we
should
do
,
whether
we
have
not
good
turn
off
our
great
portuguese
ship
,
and
stick
to
our
first
ship
and
the
sloop
,
see
we
have
scarce
man
enough
for
all
three
,
and
that
the
big
ship
be
think
too
big
for
our
business
.
<EOS>
however
,
another
dispute
,
which
be
now
decide
,
bring
the
first
to
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
the
first
dispute
be
,
whither
we
should
go
.
<EOS>
My
comrade
,
as
I
call
him
now
,
that
be
to
say
,
he
that
be
my
captain
before
we
take
this
portuguese
man
-
of
-
war
,
be
for
go
to
the
South
Seas
,
and
coast
up
the
west
side
of
America
,
where
we
could
not
fail
of
make
several
good
prize
upon
the
Spaniards
;
and
that
then
,
if
occasion
require
it
,
we
may
come
home
by
the
South
Seas
to
the
East
Indies
,
and
so
go
round
the
globe
,
as
other
have
do
before
us
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
head
lie
another
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
the
East
Indies
,
and
have
entertain
a
notion
ever
since
that
,
if
we
go
thither
,
we
could
not
fail
of
make
good
work
of
it
,
and
that
we
may
have
a
safe
retreat
,
and
good
beef
to
victual
our
ship
,
among
my
old
friend
the
native
of
Zanzibar
,
on
the
coast
of
Mozambique
,
or
the
island
of
St
Lawrence
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
my
thought
lie
this
way
;
and
I
read
so
many
lecture
to
them
all
of
the
advantage
they
would
certainly
make
of
their
strength
by
the
prize
they
would
take
in
the
Gulf
of
Mocha
,
or
the
Red
Sea
,
and
on
the
coast
of
Malabar
,
or
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
that
I
amaze
them
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
argument
I
prevail
on
them
,
and
we
all
resolve
to
steer
away
S.E.
for
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
this
resolution
,
we
conclude
to
keep
the
sloop
,
and
sail
with
all
three
,
not
doubt
,
as
I
assure
them
,
but
we
should
find
man
there
to
make
up
the
number
want
,
and
if
not
,
we
may
cast
any
of
them
off
when
we
please
.
  
<EOS>
We
could
do
no
less
than
make
our
friend
William
captain
of
the
sloop
which
,
with
such
good
management
,
he
have
bring
us
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
,
though
with
much
good
manner
,
he
would
not
command
her
as
a
frigate
;
but
,
if
we
would
give
her
to
him
for
his
share
of
the
Guinea
ship
,
which
we
come
very
honestly
by
<EOS>
,
he
would
keep
us
company
as
a
victualler
,
if
we
command
him
,
as
long
as
he
be
under
the
same
force
that
take
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
We
understand
him
,
so
give
him
the
sloop
,
but
upon
condition
that
he
should
not
go
from
us
,
and
should
be
entirely
under
our
command
.
<EOS>
however
,
William
be
not
so
easy
as
before
;
and
,
indeed
,
as
we
afterwards
want
the
sloop
to
cruise
for
purchase
,
and
a
right
thorough
-
pace
pirate
in
her
,
so
I
be
in
such
pain
for
William
that
I
could
not
be
without
him
,
for
he
be
my
privy
counsellor
and
companion
upon
all
occasion
;
so
I
put
a
Scotsman
,
a
bold
,
enterprising
,
gallant
fellow
,
into
her
,
name
Gordon
,
and
make
her
carry
twelve
gun
and
four
petereroe
,
though
,
indeed
,
we
want
man
,
for
we
be
none
of
us
man
in
proportion
to
our
force
.
  
<EOS>
We
sail
away
for
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
the
beginning
of
October
1706
,
and
pass
by
,
in
sight
of
the
Cape
,
the
12th
of
November
follow
,
have
meet
with
a
great
deal
of
bad
weather
.
<EOS>
We
see
several
merchant
-
ship
in
the
road
there
,
as
well
English
as
Dutch
,
whether
outward
bind
or
homeward
we
could
not
tell
;
be
it
what
it
would
,
we
do
not
think
fit
to
come
to
an
anchor
,
not
know
what
they
may
be
,
or
what
they
may
attempt
against
us
,
when
they
know
what
we
be
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
we
want
fresh
water
,
we
send
the
two
boat
belong
to
the
portuguese
man
-
of
-
war
,
with
all
portuguese
seaman
or
negro
in
them
,
to
the
watering
-
place
,
to
take
in
water
;
and
in
the
meantime
we
hang
out
a
portuguese
ancient
at
sea
,
and
lie
by
all
that
night
.
<EOS>
They
know
not
what
we
be
,
but
it
seem
we
pass
for
anything
<EOS>
but
really
what
we
be
.
  
<EOS>
Our
boat
return
the
third
time
loaden
,
about
five
o'clock
next
morning
,
we
think
ourselves
sufficiently
water
,
and
stand
away
to
the
eastward
;
but
,
before
our
man
return
the
last
time
,
the
wind
blow
an
easy
gale
at
west
,
we
perceive
a
boat
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
under
sail
,
crowd
to
come
up
with
us
,
as
if
they
be
afraid
we
should
be
go
.
<EOS>
We
soon
find
it
be
an
English
long
-
boat
,
and
that
it
be
pretty
full
of
man
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
imagine
what
the
meaning
of
it
should
be
;
but
,
as
it
be
but
a
boat
,
we
think
there
could
be
no
great
harm
in
it
to
let
them
come
on
board
;
and
if
it
appear
they
come
only
to
inquire
who
we
be
,
we
would
give
them
a
full
account
of
our
business
,
by
take
them
along
with
us
,
see
we
want
man
as
much
as
anything
.
<EOS>
but
they
save
us
the
labour
of
be
in
doubt
how
to
dispose
of
them
;
for
it
seem
our
portuguese
seaman
,
who
go
for
water
,
have
not
be
so
silent
at
the
watering
-
place
as
we
think
they
would
have
be
.
<EOS>
but
the
case
,
in
short
,
be
this
:
captain
#
#
#
#
(
I
forbear
his
name
at
present
,
for
a
particular
reason
)
,
captain
of
an
East
India
merchant
-
ship
,
bind
afterwards
for
China
,
have
find
some
reason
to
be
very
severe
with
his
man
,
and
have
handle
some
of
them
very
roughly
at
St
Helena
;
insomuch
,
that
they
threaten
among
themselves
to
leave
the
ship
the
first
opportunity
,
and
have
long
wish
for
that
opportunity
.
<EOS>
some
of
these
man
,
it
seem
,
have
meet
with
our
boat
at
the
watering
-
place
,
and
inquire
of
one
another
who
we
be
,
and
upon
what
account
,
whether
the
portuguese
seaman
,
by
falter
in
their
account
,
make
them
suspect
that
we
be
out
upon
the
cruise
,
or
whether
they
tell
it
in
plain
English
or
no
<EOS>
(
for
they
all
speak
English
enough
to
be
understand
)
,
but
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
that
as
soon
as
ever
the
man
carry
the
news
on
board
,
that
the
ship
which
lie
by
to
the
eastward
be
English
,
and
that
they
be
go
upon
the
account
,
which
,
by
they
way
,
be
a
sea
term
for
a
pirate
;
I
say
,
as
soon
as
ever
they
hear
it
,
they
go
to
work
,
and
get
all
thing
ready
in
the
night
,
their
chest
and
clothe
,
and
whatever
else
they
could
<EOS>
,
they
come
away
before
it
be
day
,
and
come
up
with
us
about
seven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
by
the
ship
's
side
which
I
command
we
hail
them
in
the
usual
manner
,
to
know
what
and
who
they
be
,
and
what
their
business
.
<EOS>
They
answer
they
be
Englishmen
,
and
desire
to
come
on
board
.
<EOS>
We
tell
them
they
may
lay
the
ship
on
board
,
but
order
they
should
let
only
one
man
enter
the
ship
till
the
captain
know
their
business
,
and
that
he
should
come
without
any
arm
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
ay
,
with
all
their
heart
.
  
<EOS>
We
presently
find
their
business
,
and
that
they
desire
to
go
with
us
;
and
as
for
their
arm
,
they
desire
we
would
send
man
on
board
the
boat
,
and
that
they
would
deliver
them
all
to
us
,
which
be
do
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
that
come
up
to
me
tell
me
how
they
have
be
use
by
their
captain
,
how
he
have
starve
the
man
,
and
use
them
like
dog
,
and
that
,
if
the
rest
of
the
man
know
they
should
be
admit
,
he
be
satisfy
two
-
third
of
them
would
leave
the
ship
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
fellow
be
very
hearty
in
their
resolution
,
and
jolly
brisk
sailor
they
be
;
so
I
tell
them
I
would
do
nothing
without
our
admiral
<EOS>
,
that
be
the
captain
of
the
other
ship
;
so
I
send
my
pinnace
on
board
Captain
Wilmot
,
to
desire
him
to
come
on
board
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
indispose
,
and
be
to
leeward
,
excuse
his
coming
,
but
leave
it
all
to
me
;
but
before
my
boat
be
return
,
Captain
Wilmot
call
to
me
by
his
speaking
-
trumpet
,
which
all
the
man
may
hear
as
well
as
I
;
thus
,
call
me
by
my
name
,
"
I
hear
they
be
honest
fellow
;
pray
tell
them
they
be
all
welcome
,
and
make
them
a
bowl
of
punch
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
the
man
hear
it
as
well
as
I
,
there
be
no
need
to
tell
them
what
the
captain
say
;
and
,
as
soon
as
the
trumpet
have
do
,
they
set
up
a
huzza
,
<EOS>
that
show
us
they
be
very
hearty
in
their
come
to
us
;
but
we
bind
them
to
us
by
a
strong
obligation
still
after
this
,
for
when
we
come
to
Madagascar
,
Captain
Wilmot
<EOS>
,
with
consent
of
all
the
ship
's
company
,
order
that
these
man
should
have
as
much
money
give
them
out
of
the
stock
as
be
due
to
them
for
their
pay
in
the
ship
they
have
leave
;
and
after
that
we
allow
them
twenty
piece
of
eight
a
man
bounty
money
;
and
thus
we
enter
them
upon
share
,
as
we
be
all
,
and
brave
stout
fellow
they
be
,
be
eighteen
in
number
,
whereof
two
be
midshipman
,
and
one
a
carpenter
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
28th
of
November
,
when
,
have
have
some
bad
weather
,
we
come
to
an
anchor
in
the
road
off
St
Augustine
Bay
,
at
the
south
-
west
end
of
my
old
acquaintance
the
isle
of
Madagascar
.
<EOS>
We
lay
here
awhile
and
traffic
with
the
native
for
some
good
beef
;
though
the
weather
be
so
hot
that
we
could
not
promise
ourselves
to
salt
any
of
it
up
to
keep
;
but
I
show
them
the
way
which
we
practise
before
,
to
salt
it
first
with
saltpetre
,
then
cure
it
by
dry
it
in
the
sun
,
which
make
it
eat
very
agreeably
,
though
not
so
wholesome
for
our
man
,
that
not
agree
with
our
way
of
cooking
,
viz
.
,
boil
with
pudding
,
brewis
,
&
c.
,
and
particularly
this
way
,
would
be
too
salt
,
and
the
fat
of
the
meat
be
rusty
,
or
dry
away
so
as
not
to
be
eat
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
we
could
not
help
,
and
make
ourselves
amend
by
feed
heartily
on
the
fresh
beef
while
we
be
there
,
which
be
excellent
,
good
and
fat
,
every
way
as
tender
and
as
well
relish
as
in
England
,
and
think
to
be
much
well
to
us
who
have
not
taste
any
in
England
for
so
long
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
for
some
time
remain
here
,
we
begin
to
consider
that
this
be
not
a
place
for
our
business
;
and
I
,
that
have
some
view
a
particular
way
of
my
own
,
tell
them
that
this
be
not
a
station
for
those
who
look
for
purchase
;
that
there
be
two
part
of
the
island
which
be
particularly
proper
for
our
purpose
;
first
,
the
bay
on
the
east
side
of
the
island
,
and
from
thence
to
the
island
Mauritius
,
which
be
the
usual
way
which
ship
that
come
from
the
Malabar
coast
,
or
the
coast
of
Coromandel
,
Fort
St
George
,
&
c.
,
use
to
take
,
and
where
,
if
we
wait
for
them
,
we
ought
to
take
our
station
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
as
we
do
not
resolve
to
fall
upon
the
european
trader
,
who
be
generally
ship
of
force
and
well
manned
,
and
where
blow
must
be
look
for
;
so
I
have
another
prospect
,
which
I
promise
myself
would
yield
equal
profit
,
or
perhaps
great
,
without
any
of
the
hazard
and
difficulty
of
the
former
;
and
this
be
the
Gulf
of
Mocha
,
or
the
Red
Sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
them
that
the
trade
here
be
great
,
the
ship
rich
,
and
the
Strait
of
Babelmandel
narrow
;
so
that
there
be
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
we
may
cruise
so
as
to
let
nothing
slip
our
hand
,
have
the
sea
open
from
the
Red
Sea
,
along
the
coast
of
Arabia
,
to
the
Persian
Gulf
,
and
the
Malabar
side
of
the
Indies
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
them
what
I
have
observe
when
I
sail
round
the
island
in
my
former
progress
;
how
that
,
on
the
northernmost
point
of
the
island
,
there
be
several
very
good
harbour
and
road
for
our
ship
;
that
the
native
be
even
more
civil
and
tractable
,
if
possible
,
than
those
where
we
be
,
not
have
be
so
often
ill
-
treat
by
european
sailor
as
those
have
in
the
south
and
east
side
;
and
that
we
may
always
be
sure
of
a
retreat
,
if
we
be
drive
to
put
in
by
any
necessity
,
either
of
enemy
or
weather
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
easily
convince
of
the
reasonableness
of
my
scheme
;
and
Captain
Wilmot
,
whom
I
now
call
our
admiral
,
though
he
be
at
first
of
the
mind
to
go
and
lie
at
the
island
Mauritius
,
and
wait
for
some
of
the
european
merchant
-
ship
from
the
road
of
Coromandel
,
or
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
be
now
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
we
be
strong
enough
to
have
attack
an
English
East
India
ship
of
the
great
force
,
though
some
of
them
be
say
to
carry
fifty
gun
;
but
I
represent
to
him
that
we
be
sure
to
have
blow
and
blood
if
we
take
them
;
and
,
after
we
have
do
,
their
loading
be
not
of
equal
value
to
us
,
because
we
have
no
room
to
dispose
of
their
merchandise
;
and
,
as
our
circumstance
stand
,
we
have
rather
have
take
one
outward
-
bind
East
India
ship
,
with
her
ready
cash
on
board
,
perhaps
to
the
value
of
forty
or
fifty
thousand
pound
,
than
three
homeward
-
bind
,
though
their
loading
would
at
London
be
worth
three
time
the
money
,
because
we
know
not
whither
to
go
to
dispose
of
the
cargo
;
whereas
the
ship
from
London
have
abundance
of
thing
we
know
how
to
make
use
of
besides
their
money
,
such
as
their
store
of
provision
and
liquor
,
and
great
quantity
of
the
like
send
to
the
governor
and
factory
at
the
english
settlement
for
their
use
;
so
that
,
if
we
resolve
to
look
for
our
own
country
ship
,
it
should
be
those
that
be
outward
-
bind
,
not
the
London
ship
homeward
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
thing
consider
,
bring
the
admiral
to
be
of
my
mind
entirely
;
so
,
after
take
in
water
and
some
fresh
provision
where
we
lay
,
which
be
near
Cape
St
Mary
,
on
the
south
-
west
corner
of
the
island
,
we
weigh
and
stand
away
south
,
and
afterwards
S.S.E.
,
to
round
the
island
,
and
in
about
six
day
'
sail
get
out
of
the
wake
of
the
island
,
and
steer
away
north
,
till
we
come
off
Port
Dauphin
,
and
then
north
by
east
,
to
the
latitude
of
13
degree
40
minute
,
which
be
,
in
short
,
just
at
the
farth
part
of
the
island
;
and
the
admiral
,
keep
ahead
,
make
the
open
sea
fair
to
the
west
,
clear
of
the
whole
island
;
upon
which
he
bring
to
,
and
we
send
a
sloop
to
stand
in
round
the
farth
point
north
,
and
coast
along
the
shore
,
and
see
for
a
harbour
to
put
into
,
which
they
do
,
and
soon
bring
us
an
account
that
there
be
a
deep
bay
,
with
a
very
good
road
,
and
several
little
island
,
under
which
they
find
good
riding
,
in
ten
to
seventeen
fathom
water
,
and
accordingly
there
we
put
in
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
we
afterwards
find
occasion
to
remove
our
station
,
as
you
shall
hear
presently
.
<EOS>
We
have
now
nothing
to
do
but
go
on
shore
,
and
acquaint
ourselves
a
little
with
the
native
,
take
in
fresh
water
and
some
fresh
provision
,
and
then
to
sea
again
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
people
very
easy
to
deal
with
,
and
some
cattle
they
have
;
but
it
be
at
the
extremity
of
the
island
,
they
have
not
such
quantity
of
cattle
here
.
<EOS>
however
,
for
the
present
we
resolve
to
appoint
this
for
our
place
of
rendezvous
,
and
go
and
look
out
.
<EOS>
this
be
about
the
latter
end
of
April
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
we
put
to
sea
,
and
cruise
away
to
the
northward
,
for
the
arabian
coast
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
run
,
but
as
the
wind
generally
blow
trade
from
the
S.
and
S.S.E.
from
May
to
September
,
we
have
good
weather
;
and
in
about
twenty
day
we
make
the
island
of
Socotra
,
lie
south
from
the
arabian
coast
,
and
E.S.E.
from
the
mouth
of
the
Gulf
of
Mocha
,
or
the
Red
Sea
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
take
in
water
,
and
stand
off
and
on
upon
the
arabian
shore
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
cruise
here
above
three
day
,
or
thereabout
,
but
I
spy
a
sail
,
and
give
her
chase
;
but
when
we
come
up
with
her
,
never
be
such
a
poor
prize
chase
by
pirate
that
look
for
booty
,
for
we
find
nothing
in
her
but
poor
,
half
-
naked
Turks
,
go
a
pilgrimage
to
Mecca
,
to
the
tomb
of
their
prophet
Mahomet
.
<EOS>
the
junk
that
carry
them
have
no
one
thing
worth
take
away
but
a
little
rice
and
some
coffee
,
which
be
<EOS>
all
the
poor
wretch
have
for
their
subsistence
;
so
we
let
them
go
,
for
indeed
we
know
not
what
to
do
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
evening
we
chase
another
junk
with
two
mast
,
and
in
something
well
plight
to
look
at
than
the
former
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
on
board
we
find
them
upon
the
same
errand
,
but
only
that
they
be
people
of
some
well
fashion
than
the
other
;
and
here
we
get
some
plunder
,
some
turkish
store
,
a
few
diamond
in
the
ear
-
drop
of
five
or
six
person
,
some
fine
persian
carpet
,
of
which
they
make
their
saffra
to
lie
upon
,
and
some
money
<EOS>
;
so
we
let
them
go
also
.
  
<EOS>
We
continue
here
eleven
day
longer
,
and
see
nothing
but
now
and
then
a
fishing
-
boat
;
but
the
twelfth
day
of
our
cruise
we
spy
a
ship
:
indeed
I
think
at
first
it
have
be
an
english
ship
,
but
it
appear
to
be
an
European
freight
for
a
voyage
from
Goa
,
on
the
coast
of
Malabar
,
to
the
Red
Sea
,
and
be
very
rich
.
<EOS>
We
chase
her
,
and
take
her
without
any
fight
,
though
they
have
some
gun
on
board
too
,
but
not
many
.
<EOS>
We
find
her
man
with
portuguese
seaman
,
but
under
the
direction
of
five
merchant
Turks
,
who
have
hire
her
on
the
coast
of
Malabar
of
some
portugal
merchant
,
and
have
lade
her
with
pepper
,
saltpetre
,
some
spice
,
and
the
rest
of
the
loading
<EOS>
be
chiefly
calico
and
work
silk
,
some
of
them
very
rich
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
her
and
carry
her
to
Socotra
;
but
we
really
know
not
what
to
do
with
her
,
for
the
same
reason
as
before
;
for
all
their
good
be
of
little
or
no
value
to
us
.
<EOS>
after
some
day
we
find
mean
to
let
one
of
the
turkish
merchant
know
,
that
if
he
would
ransom
the
ship
we
would
take
a
sum
of
money
and
let
them
go
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
if
I
would
let
one
of
them
go
on
shore
for
the
money
they
would
do
it
;
so
we
adjust
the
value
of
the
cargo
at
30,000
ducat
.
<EOS>
upon
this
agreement
,
we
allow
the
sloop
to
carry
him
on
shore
,
at
Dofar
,
in
Arabia
,
where
a
rich
merchant
lay
down
the
money
for
them
,
and
come
off
with
our
sloop
;
and
on
payment
of
the
money
we
very
fairly
and
honestly
let
them
go
.
  
<EOS>
some
day
after
this
we
take
an
arabian
junk
,
go
from
the
Gulf
of
Persia
to
Mocha
,
with
a
good
quantity
of
pearl
on
board
.
<EOS>
We
gutte
him
of
the
pearl
,
which
it
seem
be
belong
to
some
merchant
at
Mocha
,
and
let
him
go
,
for
there
be
nothing
else
worth
our
taking
.
  
<EOS>
We
continue
cruise
up
and
down
here
till
we
begin
to
find
our
provision
grow
low
,
when
Captain
Wilmot
,
our
admiral
,
tell
us
it
be
time
to
think
of
go
back
to
the
rendezvous
;
and
the
rest
of
the
man
say
the
same
,
be
a
little
weary
of
beat
about
for
above
three
month
together
,
and
meet
with
little
or
nothing
compare
to
our
great
expectation
;
but
I
be
very
loth
to
part
with
the
Red
Sea
at
so
cheap
a
rate
,
and
press
them
to
tarry
a
little
longer
,
which
at
my
instance
they
do
;
but
three
day
afterwards
,
to
our
great
misfortune
,
understand
that
,
by
land
the
turkish
merchant
at
Dofar
,
we
have
alarm
the
coast
as
far
as
the
Gulf
of
Persia
,
so
that
no
vessel
would
stir
that
way
,
and
consequently
nothing
be
to
be
expect
on
that
side
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
mortify
at
this
news
,
and
could
no
longer
withstand
the
importunity
of
the
man
to
return
to
Madagascar
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
wind
continue
still
to
blow
at
S.S.E.
by
S.
,
we
be
oblige
to
stand
away
towards
the
coast
of
Africa
and
the
Cape
Guardafui
,
the
wind
be
more
variable
under
the
shore
than
in
the
open
sea
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
chop
upon
a
booty
which
we
do
not
look
for
,
and
which
make
amend
for
all
our
waiting
;
for
the
very
same
hour
that
we
make
land
we
spy
a
large
vessel
sailing
along
the
shore
to
the
southward
.
<EOS>
the
ship
be
of
Bengal
,
belong
to
the
Great
Mogul
's
country
,
but
have
on
board
a
dutch
pilot
,
whose
name
,
if
I
remember
right
,
be
Vandergest
,
and
several
european
seaman
,
whereof
three
be
English
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
no
condition
to
resist
us
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
her
seaman
be
Indians
of
the
Mogul
's
subject
,
some
Malabars
and
some
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
five
indian
merchant
on
board
,
and
some
Armenians
.
<EOS>
It
seem
they
have
be
at
Mocha
with
spice
,
silk
,
diamond
,
pearl
,
calico
,
&
c.
,
such
good
as
the
country
afford
,
and
have
little
on
board
now
but
money
in
piece
of
eight
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
just
what
we
want
;
and
the
three
english
seaman
come
along
with
us
,
and
the
dutch
pilot
would
have
do
so
too
,
but
the
two
armenian
merchant
entreat
us
not
to
take
him
,
for
that
he
be
their
pilot
,
there
be
none
of
the
man
know
how
to
guide
the
ship
;
so
,
at
their
request
,
we
refuse
him
;
but
we
make
them
promise
he
should
not
be
use
ill
for
be
willing
to
go
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
get
near
200,000
piece
of
eight
in
this
vessel
;
and
,
if
they
say
true
,
there
be
a
Jew
of
Goa
,
who
intend
to
have
embark
with
them
,
who
have
200,000
piece
of
eight
with
him
,
all
his
own
;
but
his
good
fortune
,
spring
out
of
his
ill
fortune
,
hinder
him
,
or
he
fall
sick
at
Mocha
,
and
could
not
be
ready
to
travel
,
which
be
the
saving
of
his
money
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
none
with
me
at
the
taking
this
prize
but
the
sloop
,
for
Captain
Wilmot
's
ship
prove
leaky
,
he
go
away
for
the
rendezvous
before
us
,
and
arrive
there
the
middle
of
December
;
but
not
like
the
port
,
he
leave
a
great
cross
on
shore
,
with
direction
write
on
a
plate
of
lead
fix
to
it
,
for
us
to
come
after
him
to
the
great
bay
at
Mangahelly
,
where
he
find
a
very
good
harbour
;
but
we
learn
a
piece
of
news
here
that
keep
us
from
him
a
great
while
,
which
the
admiral
take
offence
at
;
but
we
stop
his
mouth
with
his
share
of
200,000
piece
of
eight
to
him
and
his
ship
's
crew
.
<EOS>
but
the
story
which
interrupt
our
come
to
him
be
this
.
<EOS>
between
mangahelly
and
another
point
,
call
Cape
St
Sebastian
,
there
come
on
shore
in
the
night
an
european
ship
,
and
whether
by
stress
of
weather
or
want
of
a
pilot
I
know
not
,
but
the
ship
strand
and
could
not
be
get
off
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
in
the
cove
or
harbour
,
where
,
as
I
have
say
,
our
rendezvous
be
appoint
,
and
have
not
yet
be
on
shore
,
so
we
have
not
see
the
direction
our
admiral
have
leave
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
Our
friend
William
,
of
whom
I
have
say
nothing
a
great
while
,
have
a
great
mind
one
day
to
go
on
shore
,
and
importune
me
to
let
him
have
a
little
troop
to
go
with
him
,
for
safety
,
that
they
may
see
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
be
mightily
against
it
for
many
reason
;
but
particularly
I
tell
him
he
know
the
native
be
but
savage
,
and
they
be
very
treacherous
,
and
I
desire
him
that
he
would
not
go
;
and
,
have
he
go
on
much
farth
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
should
have
downright
refuse
him
,
and
command
him
not
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
order
to
persuade
me
to
let
him
go
,
he
tell
me
he
would
give
me
an
account
of
the
reason
why
he
be
so
importunate
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
the
last
night
he
have
a
dream
,
which
be
so
forcible
,
and
make
such
an
impression
upon
his
mind
,
that
he
could
not
be
quiet
till
he
have
make
the
proposal
to
me
to
go
;
and
if
I
refuse
him
,
then
he
think
his
dream
be
significant
;
and
if
not
,
then
his
dream
be
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
His
dream
be
,
he
say
,
that
he
go
on
shore
with
thirty
man
,
of
which
the
cockswain
,
he
say
,
be
one
,
upon
the
island
;
and
that
they
find
a
mine
of
gold
,
and
enrich
them
all
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
main
thing
,
he
say
,
but
that
the
same
morning
he
have
dream
so
,
the
cockswain
come
to
him
just
then
,
and
tell
him
that
he
dream
he
go
on
shore
on
the
island
of
Madagascar
,
and
that
some
man
come
to
him
and
tell
him
they
would
show
him
where
he
should
get
a
prize
which
would
make
them
all
rich
.
  
<EOS>
these
two
thing
put
together
begin
to
weigh
with
me
a
little
,
though
I
be
never
inclined
to
give
any
heed
to
dream
;
but
William
's
importunity
turn
me
effectually
,
for
I
always
put
a
great
deal
of
stress
upon
his
judgment
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
I
give
them
leave
to
go
,
but
I
charge
them
not
to
go
far
off
from
the
sea
-
coast
;
that
,
if
they
be
force
down
to
the
seaside
upon
any
occasion
,
we
may
perhaps
see
them
,
and
fetch
them
off
with
our
boat
.
  
<EOS>
They
go
away
early
in
the
morning
,
one
-
and
-
thirty
man
of
them
in
number
,
very
well
armed
,
and
very
stout
fellow
;
they
travel
all
the
day
,
and
at
night
make
us
a
signal
that
all
be
well
,
from
the
top
of
a
hill
,
which
we
have
agree
on
,
by
make
a
great
fire
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
they
march
down
the
hill
on
the
other
side
,
incline
towards
the
seaside
,
as
they
have
promise
,
and
see
a
very
pleasant
valley
before
them
,
with
a
river
in
the
middle
of
it
,
which
,
a
little
farther
below
them
,
seem
to
be
big
enough
to
bear
small
ship
;
they
march
apace
towards
this
river
,
and
be
surprised
with
the
noise
of
a
piece
go
off
,
which
,
by
the
sound
,
could
not
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
They
listen
long
,
but
could
hear
no
more
;
so
they
go
on
to
the
river
-
side
,
which
be
a
very
fine
fresh
stream
,
but
widened
apace
,
and
they
keep
on
by
the
bank
of
it
,
till
,
almost
at
once
,
it
open
or
widen
into
a
good
large
creek
or
harbour
,
about
five
mile
from
the
sea
;
and
that
which
be
still
more
surprising
,
as
they
march
forward
<EOS>
,
they
plainly
see
in
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
,
or
creek
,
the
wreck
of
a
ship
.
  
<EOS>
the
tide
be
up
,
as
we
call
it
,
so
that
it
do
net
appear
very
much
above
the
water
,
but
,
as
they
make
downward
,
they
find
it
grow
big
and
big
;
and
the
tide
soon
after
ebb
out
,
they
find
it
lie
dry
upon
the
sand
,
and
appear
to
be
the
wreck
of
a
considerable
vessel
,
large
than
could
be
expect
in
that
country
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
time
,
William
,
take
out
his
glass
to
look
at
it
more
nearly
,
be
surprised
with
hear
a
musket
-
shoot
whistle
by
him
,
and
immediately
after
that
he
hear
the
gun
,
and
see
the
smoke
from
the
other
side
;
upon
which
our
man
immediately
fire
three
musket
,
to
discover
,
if
possible
,
what
or
who
they
be
.
<EOS>
upon
the
noise
of
these
gun
,
abundance
of
man
come
run
down
to
the
shore
from
among
the
tree
;
and
our
man
could
easily
perceive
that
they
be
Europeans
,
though
they
know
not
of
what
nation
;
however
,
our
man
halloo
to
them
as
loud
as
they
could
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
they
get
a
long
pole
,
and
set
it
up
,
and
hang
a
white
shirt
upon
it
for
a
flag
of
truce
.
<EOS>
They
on
the
other
side
see
it
,
by
the
help
of
their
glass
,
too
,
and
quickly
after
our
man
see
a
boat
launch
off
from
the
shore
,
as
they
think
,
but
it
be
from
another
creek
,
it
seem
;
and
immediately
they
come
row
over
the
creek
to
our
man
,
carry
also
a
white
flag
as
a
token
of
truce
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
describe
the
surprise
,
or
joy
and
satisfaction
,
that
appear
on
both
side
,
to
see
not
only
white
man
,
but
Englishmen
,
in
a
place
so
remote
;
but
what
then
must
it
be
when
they
come
to
know
one
another
,
and
to
find
that
they
be
not
only
countryman
but
comrade
,
and
that
this
be
the
very
ship
that
Captain
Wilmot
,
our
admiral
,
command
,
and
whose
company
we
have
lose
in
the
storm
at
Tobago
,
after
make
an
agreement
to
rendezvous
at
Madagascar
!
  
<EOS>
They
have
,
it
seem
,
get
intelligence
of
us
when
they
come
to
the
south
part
of
the
island
,
and
have
be
a
-
roving
as
far
as
the
Gulf
of
Bengal
,
when
they
meet
Captain
Avery
,
with
whom
they
join
,
take
several
rich
prize
,
and
,
amongst
the
rest
,
one
ship
with
the
Great
Mogul
's
daughter
,
and
an
immense
treasure
in
money
and
jewel
;
and
from
thence
they
come
about
the
coast
of
Coromandel
,
and
afterwards
that
of
Malabar
,
into
the
Gulf
of
Persia
,
where
they
also
take
some
prize
,
and
then
design
for
the
south
part
of
Madagascar
;
but
the
wind
blow
hard
at
S.E.
and
S.E.
by
E.
,
they
come
to
the
northward
of
the
isle
,
and
be
after
that
separate
by
a
furious
tempest
from
the
N.W.
<EOS>
,
they
be
force
into
the
mouth
of
that
creek
,
where
they
lose
their
ship
.
<EOS>
and
they
tell
us
,
also
,
that
they
hear
that
Captain
Avery
himself
have
lose
his
ship
also
not
far
off
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
thus
acquaint
one
another
with
their
fortune
,
the
poor
overjoyed
man
be
in
haste
to
go
back
to
communicate
their
joy
to
their
comrade
;
and
,
leave
some
of
their
man
with
our
,
the
rest
go
back
,
and
William
be
so
earnest
to
see
them
<EOS>
that
he
and
two
more
go
back
with
them
,
and
there
he
come
to
their
little
camp
where
they
live
.
<EOS>
there
be
about
a
hundred
and
sixty
man
of
them
in
all
;
they
have
get
their
gun
on
shore
,
and
some
ammunition
,
but
a
good
deal
of
their
powder
be
spoil
;
however
,
they
have
raise
a
fair
platform
,
and
mount
twelve
piece
of
cannon
upon
it
,
which
be
a
sufficient
defence
to
them
on
that
side
of
the
sea
;
and
just
at
the
end
of
the
platform
they
have
make
a
launch
and
a
little
yard
,
and
be
all
hard
at
work
,
build
another
little
ship
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
to
go
to
sea
in
;
but
they
put
a
stop
to
this
work
upon
the
news
they
have
of
our
be
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
when
our
man
go
into
their
hut
,
it
be
surprising
,
indeed
,
to
see
the
vast
stock
of
wealth
they
have
get
,
in
gold
and
silver
and
jewel
,
which
,
however
,
they
tell
us
be
a
trifle
to
what
Captain
Avery
have
,
wherever
he
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
five
day
we
have
wait
for
our
man
,
and
no
news
of
them
;
and
indeed
I
give
them
over
for
lost
,
but
be
surprised
,
after
five
day
'
waiting
,
to
see
a
ship
's
boat
come
row
towards
us
along
shore
.
<EOS>
what
to
make
of
it
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
,
but
be
at
least
better
satisfied
when
our
man
tell
me
they
hear
them
halloo
and
see
them
wave
their
cap
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
they
come
quite
up
to
us
;
and
I
see
friend
William
stand
up
in
the
boat
and
make
sign
to
us
;
so
they
come
on
board
;
but
when
I
see
there
be
but
fifteen
of
our
one
-
and
-
thirty
man
,
I
ask
him
what
have
become
of
their
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
William
,
"
they
be
all
very
well
;
and
my
dream
be
fully
make
good
,
and
the
cockswain
be
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
make
me
very
impatient
to
know
how
the
case
stand
;
so
he
tell
us
the
whole
story
,
which
indeed
surprise
us
all
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
we
weigh
,
and
stand
away
southerly
to
join
Captain
Wilmot
and
ship
at
Mangahelly
,
where
we
find
him
,
as
I
say
,
a
little
chagrined
at
our
stay
;
but
we
pacify
him
afterwards
with
tell
him
the
history
of
William
's
dream
,
and
the
consequence
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
camp
of
our
comrade
be
so
near
mangahelly
,
that
our
admiral
and
I
,
friend
William
,
and
some
of
the
man
,
resolve
to
take
the
sloop
and
go
and
see
them
,
and
fetch
them
all
,
and
their
good
,
bag
and
baggage
,
on
board
our
ship
,
which
accordingly
we
do
,
and
find
their
camp
,
their
fortification
,
the
battery
of
gun
they
have
erect
,
their
treasure
,
and
all
the
man
,
just
as
William
have
relate
it
;
so
,
after
some
stay
,
we
take
all
the
man
into
the
sloop
,
and
bring
them
away
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
we
know
what
be
become
of
Captain
Avery
;
but
after
about
a
month
,
by
the
direction
of
the
man
who
have
lose
their
ship
,
we
send
the
sloop
to
cruise
along
the
shore
,
to
find
out
,
if
possible
,
where
they
be
;
and
in
about
a
week
's
cruise
our
man
find
them
,
and
particularly
that
they
have
lose
their
ship
,
as
well
as
our
man
have
lose
theirs
,
and
that
they
be
every
way
in
as
bad
a
condition
as
our
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
ten
day
before
the
sloop
return
,
and
Captain
Avery
with
them
;
and
this
be
the
whole
force
that
,
as
I
remember
,
Captain
Avery
ever
have
with
him
;
for
now
we
join
all
our
company
together
,
and
it
stand
thus
:
 
We
have
two
ship
and
a
sloop
,
in
which
we
have
320
man
,
but
much
too
few
to
man
them
as
they
ought
to
be
,
the
great
portuguese
ship
require
of
herself
near
400
man
to
man
her
completely
.
<EOS>
as
for
our
lose
,
but
now
find
comrade
,
her
complement
of
man
be
180
,
or
thereabout
;
and
Captain
Avery
have
about
300
man
with
him
,
whereof
he
have
ten
carpenter
with
him
,
most
of
which
be
take
aboard
the
prize
they
have
take
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
all
the
force
Avery
have
at
Madagascar
,
in
the
year
1699
,
or
thereabout
,
amount
to
our
three
ship
,
for
his
own
be
lose
,
as
you
have
hear
;
and
never
have
any
more
than
about
1200
man
in
all
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
a
month
after
this
that
all
our
crew
get
together
,
and
as
Avery
be
unshipped
,
we
all
agree
to
bring
our
own
company
into
the
portuguese
man
-
of
-
war
and
the
sloop
,
and
give
Captain
Avery
the
spanish
frigate
,
with
all
the
tackle
and
furniture
,
gun
and
ammunition
,
for
his
crew
by
themselves
;
for
which
they
,
be
full
of
wealth
,
agree
to
give
us
40,000
piece
of
eight
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
next
consider
what
course
we
should
take
.
<EOS>
Captain
Avery
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
propose
our
build
a
little
city
here
,
establish
ourselves
on
shore
,
with
a
good
fortification
and
work
proper
to
defend
ourselves
;
and
that
,
as
we
have
wealth
enough
,
and
could
increase
it
to
what
degree
we
please
,
we
should
content
ourselves
to
retire
here
,
and
bid
defiance
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
I
soon
convince
him
that
this
place
would
be
no
security
to
us
,
if
we
pretend
to
carry
on
our
cruise
trade
;
for
that
then
all
the
nation
of
Europe
,
and
indeed
of
that
part
of
the
world
,
would
be
engage
to
root
us
out
;
but
if
we
resolve
to
live
there
as
in
retirement
,
and
plant
in
the
country
as
private
man
,
and
give
over
our
trade
of
pirating
,
then
,
indeed
,
we
may
plant
and
settle
ourselves
where
we
please
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
I
tell
him
,
the
good
way
would
be
to
treat
with
the
native
,
and
buy
a
tract
of
land
of
them
farther
up
the
country
,
seat
upon
some
navigable
river
,
where
boat
may
go
up
and
down
for
pleasure
,
but
not
ship
to
endanger
us
;
that
thus
plant
the
high
ground
with
cattle
,
such
as
cow
and
goat
,
of
which
the
country
also
be
full
,
to
be
sure
we
may
live
here
as
well
as
any
man
in
the
world
;
and
I
own
to
him
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
a
good
retreat
for
those
that
be
willing
to
leave
off
and
lie
down
,
and
yet
do
not
care
to
venture
home
and
be
hang
;
that
be
to
say
,
to
run
the
risk
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Avery
,
however
he
make
no
positive
discovery
of
his
intention
,
seem
to
me
to
decline
my
notion
of
go
up
into
the
country
to
plant
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
apparent
he
be
of
Captain
Wilmot
's
opinion
,
that
they
may
maintain
themselves
on
shore
,
and
yet
carry
on
their
cruising
trade
too
;
and
upon
this
they
resolve
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
afterwards
understand
,
about
fifty
of
their
man
go
up
the
country
,
and
settle
themselves
in
an
inland
place
as
a
colony
.
<EOS>
whether
they
be
there
still
or
not
,
I
can
not
tell
,
or
how
many
of
them
be
leave
alive
;
but
it
be
my
opinion
they
be
there
still
,
and
that
they
be
considerably
increase
,
for
,
as
I
hear
,
they
have
get
some
woman
among
them
,
though
not
many
;
for
it
seem
five
dutch
woman
and
three
or
four
little
girl
be
take
by
them
in
a
dutch
ship
,
which
they
afterwards
take
go
to
Mocha
;
and
three
of
those
woman
,
marry
some
of
these
man
,
go
with
them
to
live
in
their
new
plantation
.
<EOS>
but
of
this
I
speak
only
by
hearsay
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
lay
here
some
time
,
I
find
our
people
mightily
divide
in
their
notion
;
some
be
for
go
this
way
,
and
some
that
,
till
at
last
I
begin
to
foresee
they
would
part
company
,
and
perhaps
we
should
not
have
man
enough
to
keep
together
to
man
the
great
ship
;
so
I
take
Captain
Wilmot
aside
,
and
begin
to
talk
to
him
about
it
,
but
soon
perceive
that
he
incline
himself
to
stay
at
Madagascar
,
and
have
get
a
vast
wealth
for
his
own
share
,
have
secret
design
of
get
home
some
way
or
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
argue
the
impossibility
of
it
,
and
the
hazard
he
would
run
,
either
of
fall
into
the
hand
of
thief
and
murderer
in
the
Red
Sea
,
who
would
never
let
such
a
treasure
as
his
pass
their
hand
,
or
of
his
falling
into
the
hand
of
the
English
,
Dutch
,
or
French
,
who
would
certainly
hang
him
for
a
pirate
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
an
account
of
the
voyage
I
have
make
from
this
very
place
to
the
continent
of
Africa
,
and
what
a
journey
it
be
to
travel
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
nothing
could
persuade
him
,
but
he
would
go
into
the
Red
Sea
with
the
sloop
,
and
where
the
child
of
Israel
pass
through
the
sea
dry
-
shod
,
and
,
land
there
,
would
travel
to
Grand
Cairo
by
land
,
which
be
not
above
eighty
mile
,
and
<EOS>
from
thence
he
say
he
could
ship
himself
,
by
the
way
of
Alexandria
,
to
any
part
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
represent
the
hazard
,
and
indeed
the
impossibility
,
of
his
passing
by
Mocha
and
Jiddah
without
be
attack
,
if
he
offer
it
by
force
,
or
plunder
,
if
he
go
to
get
leave
;
and
explain
the
reason
of
it
so
much
and
so
effectually
,
that
,
though
at
last
he
would
not
hearken
to
it
himself
,
none
of
his
man
would
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
tell
him
they
would
go
anywhere
with
him
to
serve
him
,
but
that
this
be
run
himself
and
them
into
certain
destruction
,
without
any
possibility
of
avoid
it
,
or
probability
of
answer
his
end
.
<EOS>
the
captain
take
what
I
say
to
him
quite
wrong
,
and
pretend
to
resent
it
,
and
give
me
some
buccaneer
word
upon
it
;
but
I
give
him
no
return
to
it
<EOS>
but
this
:
that
I
advise
him
for
his
advantage
;
that
if
he
do
not
understand
it
so
,
it
be
his
fault
,
not
mine
;
that
I
do
not
forbid
him
to
go
,
nor
have
I
offer
to
persuade
any
of
the
man
not
to
go
with
him
,
though
it
be
to
their
apparent
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
warm
head
be
not
easily
cool
.
<EOS>
the
captain
be
so
eager
that
he
quit
our
company
,
and
,
with
most
part
of
his
crew
,
go
over
to
Captain
Avery
,
and
sort
with
his
people
,
take
all
the
treasure
with
him
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
not
very
fair
in
him
,
we
have
agree
to
share
all
our
gain
,
whether
more
or
less
,
whether
absent
or
present
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
mutter
a
little
at
it
,
but
I
pacify
them
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
tell
them
it
be
easy
for
us
to
get
as
much
,
if
we
mind
our
hit
;
and
Captain
Wilmot
have
set
us
a
very
good
example
;
for
,
by
the
same
rule
,
the
agreement
of
any
further
sharing
of
profit
with
them
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
I
take
this
occasion
to
put
into
their
head
<EOS>
some
part
of
my
further
design
,
which
be
,
to
range
over
the
eastern
sea
,
and
see
if
we
could
not
make
ourselves
as
rich
as
Mr
Avery
,
who
,
it
be
true
,
have
get
a
prodigious
deal
of
money
,
though
not
one
-
half
of
what
be
say
of
it
in
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
be
so
pleased
with
my
forward
,
enterprise
temper
,
that
they
assure
me
that
they
would
go
with
me
,
one
and
all
,
over
the
whole
globe
,
wherever
I
would
carry
them
;
and
as
for
Captain
Wilmot
,
they
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
this
come
to
his
ear
,
and
put
him
into
a
great
rage
,
so
that
he
threaten
,
if
I
come
on
shore
,
he
would
cut
my
throat
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
information
of
it
privately
,
but
take
no
notice
of
it
at
all
;
only
I
take
care
not
to
go
unprovided
for
him
,
and
seldom
walk
about
but
in
very
good
company
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
Captain
Wilmot
and
I
meet
,
and
talk
over
the
matter
very
seriously
,
and
I
offer
him
the
sloop
to
go
where
he
please
,
or
,
if
he
be
not
satisfied
with
that
,
I
offer
to
take
the
sloop
and
leave
him
the
great
ship
;
but
he
decline
both
,
and
only
desire
that
I
would
leave
him
six
carpenter
,
which
I
have
in
our
ship
more
than
I
have
need
of
,
to
help
his
man
to
finish
the
sloop
that
be
begin
before
we
come
thither
,
by
the
man
that
lose
their
ship
.
<EOS>
this
I
consent
readily
to
,
and
lend
him
several
other
hand
that
be
useful
to
them
;
and
in
a
little
time
they
build
a
stout
brigantine
,
able
to
carry
fourteen
gun
and
200
man
.
  
<EOS>
what
measure
they
take
,
and
how
Captain
Avery
manage
afterwards
,
be
too
long
a
story
to
meddle
with
here
;
nor
be
it
any
of
my
business
,
have
my
own
story
still
upon
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
here
,
about
these
several
simple
dispute
,
almost
five
month
,
when
,
about
the
latter
end
of
March
,
I
set
sail
with
the
great
ship
,
have
in
her
forty
-
four
gun
and
400
man
,
and
the
sloop
,
carry
eighty
man
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
steer
to
the
Malabar
coast
,
and
so
to
the
Gulf
of
Persia
,
as
be
first
intend
,
the
east
monsoon
blow
yet
too
strong
,
but
we
keep
more
under
the
african
coast
,
where
we
have
the
wind
variable
till
we
pass
the
line
,
and
make
the
Cape
Bassa
,
in
the
latitude
of
four
degree
ten
minute
;
from
thence
,
the
monsoon
begin
to
change
to
the
N.E.
and
N.N.E.
,
we
lead
it
away
,
with
the
wind
large
,
to
the
Maldives
,
a
famous
ledge
of
island
,
well
know
by
all
the
sailor
who
have
go
into
those
part
of
the
world
;
and
,
leave
these
island
a
little
to
the
south
,
we
make
Cape
Comorin
,
the
southernmost
land
of
the
coast
of
Malabar
,
and
go
round
the
isle
of
Ceylon
.
<EOS>
here
we
lay
by
a
while
to
wait
for
purchase
;
and
here
we
see
three
large
English
East
India
ship
go
from
Bengal
,
or
from
Fort
St
George
,
homeward
for
England
,
or
rather
for
Bombay
and
Surat
,
till
the
trade
set
in
.
  
<EOS>
We
bring
to
,
and
hoist
an
english
ancient
and
pendant
,
lie
by
for
them
,
as
if
we
intend
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
us
<EOS>
a
good
while
,
though
they
see
our
colour
;
<EOS>
and
I
believe
at
first
they
think
us
to
be
French
;
<EOS>
but
as
they
come
nearer
to
us
,
we
let
them
soon
see
what
we
be
,
for
we
hoist
a
black
flag
,
with
two
cross
dagger
in
it
,
on
our
main
-
top
-
mast
head
,
which
let
them
see
what
they
be
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
We
soon
find
the
effect
of
this
;
for
at
first
they
spread
their
ancient
,
and
make
up
to
us
in
a
line
,
as
if
they
would
fight
us
,
have
the
wind
off
shore
,
fair
enough
to
have
bring
them
on
board
us
;
but
when
they
see
what
force
we
be
of
,
and
find
we
be
cruiser
of
another
kind
,
they
stand
away
from
us
again
,
with
all
the
sail
they
could
make
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
come
up
,
we
should
have
give
them
an
unexpected
welcome
,
but
as
it
be
,
we
have
no
mind
to
follow
them
;
so
we
let
them
go
,
for
the
same
reason
which
I
mention
before
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
we
let
them
pass
,
we
do
not
design
to
let
other
go
at
so
easy
a
price
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
the
next
morning
that
we
see
a
sail
standing
round
Cape
Comorin
,
and
steering
,
as
we
think
,
the
same
course
with
us
.
<EOS>
We
know
not
at
first
what
to
do
with
her
,
because
she
have
the
shore
on
her
larboard
quarter
,
and
if
we
offer
to
chase
her
,
she
may
put
into
any
port
or
creek
,
and
escape
us
;
but
,
to
prevent
this
,
we
send
the
sloop
to
get
in
between
her
and
the
land
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
see
that
,
she
haul
in
to
keep
the
land
aboard
,
and
when
the
sloop
stand
towards
her
she
make
right
ashore
,
with
all
the
canvas
she
could
spread
.
  
<EOS>
the
sloop
,
however
,
come
up
with
her
and
engage
her
,
and
find
she
be
a
vessel
of
ten
gun
,
Portuguese
build
,
but
in
the
dutch
trader
'
hand
,
and
man
by
Dutchmen
,
who
be
bind
from
the
Gulf
of
Persia
to
Batavia
,
to
fetch
spice
and
other
good
from
thence
.
<EOS>
the
sloop
's
man
take
her
,
and
have
the
rummaging
of
her
before
we
come
up
.
<EOS>
She
have
in
her
some
european
good
,
and
a
good
round
sum
of
money
,
and
some
pearl
;
so
that
,
though
we
do
not
go
to
the
gulf
for
the
pearl
,
the
pearl
come
to
us
out
of
the
gulf
,
and
we
have
our
share
of
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
rich
ship
,
and
the
good
be
of
very
considerable
value
,
besides
the
money
and
the
pearl
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
long
consultation
here
what
we
should
do
with
the
man
,
for
to
give
them
the
ship
,
and
let
them
pursue
their
voyage
to
Java
,
would
be
to
alarm
the
dutch
factory
there
,
who
be
by
far
the
strong
in
the
Indies
,
and
to
make
our
passage
that
way
impracticable
;
whereas
we
resolve
to
visit
that
part
of
the
world
in
our
way
,
but
be
not
willing
to
pass
the
great
Bay
of
Bengal
,
where
we
hope
for
a
great
deal
of
purchase
;
and
therefore
it
behove
us
not
to
be
waylay
before
we
come
there
,
because
they
know
we
must
pass
by
the
Straits
of
Malacca
,
or
those
of
Sunda
;
and
either
way
it
be
very
easy
to
prevent
us
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
consult
this
in
the
great
cabin
,
the
man
have
have
the
same
debate
before
the
mast
;
and
it
seem
the
majority
there
be
for
pickle
up
the
poor
dutchman
among
the
herring
;
in
a
word
,
they
be
for
throw
them
all
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Poor
William
,
the
Quaker
,
be
in
great
concern
about
this
,
and
come
directly
to
me
to
talk
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
hark
thee
,
"
say
William
,
"
what
wilt
thou
do
with
these
dutchman
that
thou
hast
on
board
?
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
not
let
them
go
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
William
,
would
you
advise
me
to
let
them
go
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
can
not
say
it
be
fit
for
thee
to
let
them
go
;
that
be
to
say
,
to
go
on
with
their
voyage
to
Batavia
,
because
it
be
not
for
thy
turn
that
the
Dutch
at
Batavia
should
have
any
knowledge
of
thy
be
in
these
sea
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
I
know
no
remedy
but
to
throw
them
overboard
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
a
Dutchman
swim
like
a
fish
;
and
<EOS>
all
our
people
here
be
of
the
same
opinion
as
well
as
I.
"
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
resolve
it
should
not
be
do
,
but
want
to
hear
what
William
would
say
.
<EOS>
He
gravely
reply
,
"
if
all
the
man
in
the
ship
be
of
that
mind
,
I
will
never
believe
that
thou
wilt
be
of
that
mind
thyself
,
for
I
have
hear
thee
protest
against
cruelty
in
all
other
case
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
be
true
;
but
what
then
shall
we
do
with
them
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
William
,
"
be
there
no
way
but
to
murder
them
?
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
thou
canst
not
be
in
earnest
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
be
not
in
earnest
;
but
they
shall
not
go
to
Java
,
no
,
nor
to
Ceylon
,
that
be
certain
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
William
,
"
the
man
have
do
thee
no
injury
at
all
;
thou
hast
take
a
great
treasure
from
them
;
what
canst
thou
pretend
to
hurt
them
for
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
not
talk
of
that
;
I
have
pretence
enough
,
if
that
be
all
;
my
pretence
be
,
to
prevent
do
me
hurt
,
and
that
be
as
necessary
a
piece
of
the
law
of
self
-
preservation
as
any
you
can
name
;
but
the
main
thing
be
,
I
know
not
what
to
do
with
them
,
to
prevent
their
prating
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
William
and
I
be
talk
,
the
poor
dutchman
be
openly
condemn
to
die
,
as
it
may
be
call
,
by
the
whole
ship
's
company
;
and
so
warm
be
the
man
upon
it
,
that
they
grow
very
clamorous
;
and
when
they
hear
that
William
be
against
it
,
some
of
them
swear
they
should
die
,
and
if
William
oppose
it
,
he
should
drown
along
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
resolve
to
put
an
end
to
their
cruel
project
,
so
I
find
it
be
time
to
take
upon
me
a
little
,
or
the
bloody
humour
may
grow
too
strong
;
so
I
call
the
dutchman
up
,
and
talk
a
little
with
them
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
ask
them
if
they
be
willing
to
go
with
us
.
<EOS>
two
of
them
offer
it
presently
;
but
the
rest
,
which
be
fourteen
,
decline
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
where
would
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
desire
they
should
go
to
Ceylon
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
tell
them
I
could
not
allow
them
to
go
to
any
dutch
factory
,
and
tell
them
very
plainly
the
reason
of
it
,
which
they
could
not
deny
to
be
just
.
<EOS>
I
let
them
know
also
the
cruel
,
bloody
measure
of
our
man
,
but
that
I
have
resolve
to
save
them
,
if
possible
;
and
therefore
I
tell
them
I
would
set
them
on
shore
at
some
english
factory
in
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
or
put
them
on
board
any
english
ship
I
meet
,
after
I
be
past
the
Straits
of
Sunda
or
of
Malacca
,
but
not
before
;
for
,
as
to
my
come
back
again
,
I
tell
them
I
would
run
the
venture
of
their
dutch
power
from
Batavia
,
but
I
would
not
have
the
news
come
there
before
me
,
because
it
would
make
all
their
merchant
-
ship
lie
up
,
and
keep
out
of
our
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
next
into
our
consideration
what
we
should
do
with
their
ship
;
but
this
be
not
long
resolve
;
for
there
be
but
two
way
,
either
to
set
her
on
fire
,
or
to
run
her
on
shore
,
and
we
choose
the
last
.
<EOS>
so
we
set
her
foresail
with
the
tack
at
the
cat
-
head
,
and
lash
her
helm
a
little
to
starboard
,
to
answer
her
head
-
sail
,
and
so
set
her
agoing
,
with
neither
cat
or
dog
in
her
;
and
it
be
not
above
two
hour
before
we
see
her
run
right
ashore
upon
the
coast
,
a
little
beyond
the
Cape
Comorin
;
and
away
we
go
round
about
Ceylon
,
for
the
coast
of
Coromandel
.
  
<EOS>
We
sail
along
there
,
not
in
sight
of
the
shore
only
,
but
so
near
as
to
see
the
ship
in
the
road
at
Fort
St
David
,
Fort
St
George
,
and
at
the
other
factory
along
that
shore
,
as
well
as
along
the
coast
of
Golconda
,
carry
our
english
ancient
when
we
come
near
the
dutch
factory
,
and
dutch
colour
when
we
pass
by
the
english
factory
.
<EOS>
We
meet
with
little
purchase
upon
this
coast
,
except
two
small
vessel
of
Golconda
,
bind
across
the
bay
with
bale
of
calico
and
muslin
and
wrought
silk
,
and
fifteen
bale
of
romal
,
from
the
bottom
of
the
bay
,
which
be
go
,
on
whose
account
we
know
not
,
to
Acheen
,
and
to
other
port
on
the
coast
of
Malacca
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
inquire
to
what
place
in
particular
;
but
we
let
the
vessel
go
,
have
none
but
Indians
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
bottom
of
the
bay
we
meet
with
a
great
junk
belong
to
the
Mogul
's
court
,
with
a
great
many
people
,
passenger
as
we
suppose
them
to
be
:
it
seem
they
be
bind
for
the
river
hooghly
or
gange
,
and
come
from
Sumatra
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
prize
worth
take
indeed
;
and
we
get
so
much
gold
in
her
,
besides
other
good
which
we
do
not
meddle
with
 
pepper
in
particular
 
that
it
have
like
to
have
put
an
end
to
our
cruise
;
for
almost
all
my
man
say
we
be
rich
enough
,
and
desire
to
go
back
again
to
Madagascar
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
other
thing
in
my
head
still
,
and
when
I
come
to
talk
with
them
,
and
set
friend
William
to
talk
with
them
,
we
put
such
further
golden
hope
into
their
head
that
we
soon
prevail
with
them
to
let
us
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
design
be
to
leave
all
the
dangerous
strait
of
Malacca
,
Singapore
,
and
Sunda
,
where
we
could
expect
no
great
booty
,
but
what
we
may
light
on
in
european
ship
,
which
we
must
fight
for
;
and
though
we
be
able
to
fight
,
and
want
no
courage
,
even
to
desperation
,
yet
we
be
rich
too
,
and
resolve
to
be
rich
,
and
take
this
for
our
maxim
,
that
while
we
be
sure
the
wealth
we
seek
be
to
be
have
without
fighting
,
we
have
no
occasion
to
put
ourselves
to
the
necessity
of
fighting
for
that
which
would
come
upon
easy
term
.
  
<EOS>
We
leave
,
therefore
,
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
and
come
to
the
coast
of
Sumatra
,
we
put
in
at
a
small
port
,
where
there
be
a
town
,
inhabit
only
by
malay
;
and
here
we
take
in
fresh
water
,
and
a
large
quantity
of
good
pork
,
pickle
up
and
well
salted
,
notwithstanding
the
heat
of
the
climate
,
be
in
the
very
middle
of
the
torrid
zone
,
viz
.
,
in
three
degree
fifteen
minute
north
latitude
.
<EOS>
We
also
take
on
board
<EOS>
both
our
vessel
forty
hog
alive
,
which
serve
us
for
fresh
provision
,
have
abundance
of
food
for
them
,
such
as
the
country
produce
,
such
as
guam
,
potato
,
and
a
sort
of
coarse
rice
,
good
for
nothing
else
but
to
feed
the
swine
.
<EOS>
We
kill
one
of
these
hog
every
day
,
and
find
them
to
be
excellent
meat
.
<EOS>
We
take
in
also
a
monstrous
quantity
of
duck
,
and
cock
and
hen
,
the
same
kind
as
we
have
in
England
,
which
we
keep
for
change
of
provision
;
and
if
I
remember
right
,
we
have
no
less
than
two
thousand
of
them
;
so
that
at
first
we
be
pester
with
them
very
much
,
but
we
soon
lessen
them
by
boil
,
roasting
,
stewing
,
&
c.
,
for
we
never
want
while
we
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
long
-
project
design
now
lie
open
to
me
,
which
be
to
fall
in
amongst
the
Dutch
Spice
Islands
,
and
see
what
mischief
I
could
do
there
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
put
out
to
sea
the
12th
of
August
,
and
pass
the
line
on
the
17th
,
we
stand
away
due
south
,
leave
the
Straits
of
Sunda
and
the
isle
of
Java
on
the
east
,
till
we
come
to
the
latitude
of
eleven
degree
twenty
minute
,
when
we
steer
east
and
E.N.E.
,
have
easy
gale
from
the
W.S.W.
till
we
come
among
the
Moluccas
,
or
Spice
Islands
.
  
<EOS>
We
pass
those
sea
with
less
difficulty
than
in
other
place
,
the
wind
to
the
south
of
Java
be
more
variable
,
and
the
weather
good
,
though
sometimes
we
meet
with
squally
weather
and
short
storm
;
but
when
we
come
in
among
the
Spice
Islands
themselves
we
have
a
share
of
the
monsoon
,
or
trade
-
wind
,
and
make
use
of
them
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
the
infinite
number
of
island
which
lie
in
these
sea
embarrass
us
strangely
,
and
it
be
with
great
difficulty
that
we
work
our
way
through
them
;
then
we
steer
for
the
north
side
of
the
Philippines
,
when
we
have
a
double
chance
for
purchase
,
viz
.
,
either
to
meet
with
the
spanish
ship
from
Acapulco
,
on
the
coast
of
New
Spain
,
or
we
be
certain
not
to
fail
of
find
some
ship
or
junk
of
China
,
who
,
if
they
come
from
China
,
would
have
a
great
quantity
of
good
of
value
on
board
,
as
well
as
money
;
or
if
we
take
them
go
back
,
we
should
find
them
laden
with
nutmeg
and
clove
from
Banda
and
Ternate
,
or
from
some
of
the
other
island
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
right
in
our
guess
here
to
a
tittle
,
and
we
steer
directly
through
a
large
outlet
,
which
they
call
a
strait
,
though
it
be
fifteen
mile
broad
,
and
to
an
island
they
call
Dammer
,
and
from
thence
N.N.E.
to
Banda
.
<EOS>
between
these
island
we
meet
with
a
dutch
junk
,
or
vessel
,
go
to
Amboyna
:
we
take
her
without
much
trouble
,
and
I
have
much
ado
to
prevent
our
man
murder
all
the
man
,
as
soon
as
they
hear
them
say
they
belong
to
Amboyna
:
the
reason
I
suppose
any
one
will
guess
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
out
of
her
about
sixteen
ton
of
nutmeg
,
some
provision
,
and
their
small
-
arm
,
for
they
have
no
great
gun
,
and
let
the
ship
go
:
from
thence
we
sail
directly
to
the
Banda
Island
,
or
Islands
,
where
we
be
sure
to
get
more
nutmeg
if
we
think
fit
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
would
willingly
have
get
more
nutmeg
,
though
I
have
pay
for
them
,
but
our
people
abhor
pay
for
anything
;
so
we
get
about
twelve
ton
more
at
several
time
,
most
of
them
from
shore
,
and
only
a
few
in
a
small
boat
of
the
native
,
which
be
go
to
Gilolo
.
<EOS>
We
would
have
trade
openly
,
but
the
Dutch
,
who
have
make
themselves
master
of
all
those
island
,
forbid
the
people
deal
with
us
,
or
any
stranger
whatever
,
and
keep
them
so
in
awe
that
they
durst
not
do
it
;
so
we
could
indeed
have
make
nothing
of
it
if
we
have
stay
longer
,
and
therefore
resolve
to
be
go
for
Ternate
,
and
see
if
we
could
make
up
our
loading
with
clove
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
we
stand
away
north
,
but
find
ourselves
so
entangle
among
innumerable
island
,
and
without
any
pilot
that
understand
the
channel
and
race
between
them
,
that
we
be
oblige
to
give
it
over
,
and
resolve
to
go
back
again
to
Banda
,
and
see
what
we
could
get
among
the
other
island
thereabout
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
adventure
we
make
here
have
like
to
have
be
fatal
to
us
all
,
for
the
sloop
,
be
ahead
,
make
the
signal
to
us
for
see
a
sail
,
and
afterwards
another
,
and
a
third
,
by
which
we
understand
she
see
three
sail
;
whereupon
we
make
more
sail
to
come
up
with
her
,
but
on
a
sudden
be
get
among
some
rock
,
fall
foul
upon
them
in
such
a
manner
as
fright
us
all
very
heartily
;
for
have
,
it
seem
,
but
just
water
enough
,
as
it
be
to
an
inch
,
our
rudder
strike
upon
the
top
of
a
rock
,
which
give
us
a
terrible
shock
,
and
split
a
great
piece
off
the
rudder
,
and
indeed
disable
it
so
that
our
ship
would
not
steer
at
all
,
at
least
not
so
as
to
be
depend
upon
;
and
we
be
glad
to
hand
all
our
sail
,
except
our
fore
-
sail
and
main
-
topsail
,
and
with
them
we
stand
away
to
the
east
,
to
see
if
we
could
find
any
creek
or
harbour
where
we
may
lay
the
ship
on
shore
,
and
repair
our
rudder
;
besides
,
we
find
the
ship
herself
have
receive
some
damage
,
for
she
have
some
little
leak
near
her
stern
-
post
,
but
a
great
way
under
water
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
mischance
we
lose
the
advantage
,
whatever
they
be
,
of
the
three
sail
of
ship
,
which
we
afterwards
come
to
hear
be
small
dutch
ship
from
Batavia
,
go
to
Banda
and
Amboyna
,
to
load
spice
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
have
a
good
quantity
of
money
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
disaster
I
have
be
speak
of
you
may
very
well
suppose
that
we
come
to
an
anchor
as
soon
as
we
could
,
which
be
upon
a
small
island
not
far
from
Banda
,
where
,
though
the
Dutch
keep
no
factory
,
yet
they
come
at
the
season
to
buy
nutmeg
and
mace
.
<EOS>
We
stay
there
thirteen
day
;
but
there
be
no
place
where
we
could
lay
the
ship
on
shore
,
we
send
the
sloop
to
cruise
among
the
island
,
to
look
out
for
a
place
fit
for
us
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
we
get
very
good
water
here
,
some
provision
,
root
,
and
fruit
,
and
a
good
quantity
of
nutmeg
and
mace
,
which
we
find
way
to
trade
with
the
native
for
,
without
the
knowledge
of
their
master
,
the
Dutch
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
our
sloop
return
;
have
find
another
island
where
there
be
a
very
good
harbour
,
we
run
in
,
and
come
to
an
anchor
.
<EOS>
We
immediately
unbend
all
our
sail
,
send
them
ashore
upon
the
island
,
and
set
up
seven
or
eight
tent
with
them
;
then
we
unrig
our
top
-
mast
,
and
cut
them
down
,
hoist
all
our
gun
out
,
our
provision
and
loading
,
and
put
them
ashore
in
the
tent
.
<EOS>
with
the
gun
we
make
two
small
battery
,
for
fear
of
a
surprise
,
and
keep
a
look
-
out
upon
the
hill
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
all
ready
,
we
lay
the
ship
aground
upon
a
hard
sand
,
the
upper
end
of
the
harbour
,
and
shore
her
up
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
at
low
water
she
lie
almost
dry
,
so
we
mend
her
bottom
,
and
stop
the
leak
,
which
be
occasion
by
strain
some
of
the
rudder
iron
with
the
shock
which
the
ship
have
against
the
rock
.
  
<EOS>
have
do
this
,
we
also
take
occasion
to
clean
her
bottom
,
which
,
have
be
at
sea
so
long
,
be
very
foul
.
<EOS>
the
sloop
wash
and
tallowe
also
,
but
be
ready
before
us
,
and
cruise
eight
or
ten
day
among
the
island
,
but
meet
with
no
purchase
;
so
that
we
begin
to
be
tired
of
the
place
,
have
little
to
divert
us
but
the
most
furious
clap
of
thunder
that
ever
be
hear
or
read
of
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
in
hope
to
have
meet
with
some
purchase
here
among
the
Chinese
,
who
,
we
have
be
tell
,
come
to
Ternate
to
trade
for
clove
,
and
to
the
Banda
Isles
for
nutmeg
;
and
we
would
have
be
very
glad
to
have
load
our
galleon
,
or
great
ship
,
with
these
two
sort
of
spice
,
and
have
think
it
a
glorious
voyage
;
but
we
find
nothing
stir
more
than
what
I
have
say
,
except
Dutchmen
,
who
,
by
what
mean
we
could
not
imagine
,
have
either
a
jealousy
of
us
or
intelligence
of
us
,
and
keep
themselves
close
in
their
port
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
once
resolve
to
have
make
a
descent
at
the
island
of
Dumas
,
the
place
most
famous
for
the
good
nutmeg
;
but
friend
William
,
who
be
always
for
do
our
business
without
fight
,
dissuade
me
from
it
,
and
give
such
reason
for
it
that
we
could
not
resist
;
particularly
the
great
heat
of
the
season
,
and
of
the
place
,
for
we
be
now
in
the
latitude
of
just
half
a
degree
south
.
<EOS>
but
while
we
be
dispute
this
point
we
be
soon
determine
by
the
follow
accident
:
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
strong
gale
of
wind
at
S.W.
by
W.
,
and
the
ship
have
fresh
way
,
but
a
great
sea
roll
in
upon
us
from
the
N.E.
,
which
we
afterwards
find
be
the
pouring
in
of
the
great
ocean
east
of
New
Guinea
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
say
,
we
stand
away
large
,
and
make
fresh
way
,
when
,
on
the
sudden
,
from
a
dark
cloud
which
hover
over
our
head
,
come
a
flash
,
or
rather
blast
,
of
lightning
,
which
be
so
terrible
,
and
quiver
so
long
among
us
,
that
not
I
only
,
but
all
our
man
,
think
the
ship
be
on
fire
.
<EOS>
the
heat
of
the
flash
,
or
fire
,
be
so
sensibly
feel
in
our
face
,
that
some
of
our
man
have
blister
raise
by
it
on
their
skin
,
not
immediately
,
perhaps
,
by
the
heat
,
but
by
the
poisonous
or
noxious
particle
which
mix
themselves
with
the
matter
inflame
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
;
the
shock
of
the
air
,
which
the
fracture
in
the
cloud
make
,
be
such
that
our
ship
shake
as
when
a
broadside
be
fire
;
and
her
motion
be
check
,
as
it
be
at
once
,
by
a
repulse
superior
to
the
force
that
give
her
way
before
,
the
sail
all
fly
back
in
a
moment
,
and
the
ship
lie
,
as
we
may
truly
say
,
thunder
-
strike
.
<EOS>
as
the
blast
from
the
cloud
be
so
very
near
us
,
it
be
but
<EOS>
a
few
moment
after
the
flash
that
the
terrible
clap
of
thunder
follow
that
be
ever
hear
by
mortal
.
<EOS>
I
firmly
believe
a
blast
of
a
hundred
thousand
barrel
of
gunpowder
could
not
have
be
great
to
our
hearing
;
nay
,
indeed
,
to
some
of
our
man
<EOS>
it
take
away
their
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
for
me
to
describe
,
or
any
one
to
conceive
,
the
terror
of
that
minute
.
<EOS>
Our
man
be
in
such
a
consternation
,
that
not
a
man
on
board
<EOS>
the
ship
have
presence
of
mind
to
apply
to
the
proper
duty
of
a
sailor
,
except
friend
William
;
and
have
he
not
run
very
nimbly
,
and
with
a
composure
that
I
be
sure
I
be
not
master
of
,
to
let
go
the
fore
-
sheet
,
set
in
the
weather
-
brace
of
the
fore
-
yard
,
and
haul
down
the
top
-
sail
,
we
have
certainly
bring
all
our
mast
by
the
board
,
and
perhaps
have
be
overwhelm
in
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
I
must
confess
my
eye
be
open
to
my
danger
,
though
not
the
least
to
anything
of
application
for
remedy
.
<EOS>
I
be
all
amazement
and
confusion
,
and
this
be
the
first
time
that
I
can
say
I
begin
to
feel
the
effect
of
that
horror
which
I
know
since
much
more
of
,
upon
the
just
reflection
on
my
former
life
.
<EOS>
I
think
myself
doom
by
Heaven
to
sink
that
moment
into
eternal
destruction
;
and
with
this
peculiar
mark
of
terror
,
viz
.
,
that
the
vengeance
be
not
execute
in
the
ordinary
way
of
human
justice
,
but
that
God
have
take
me
into
His
immediate
disposing
,
and
have
resolve
to
be
the
executer
of
His
own
vengeance
.
  
<EOS>
let
them
alone
describe
the
confusion
I
be
in
<EOS>
who
know
what
be
the
case
of
[
John
]
Child
,
of
Shadwell
,
or
Francis
Spira
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
describe
it
.
<EOS>
My
soul
be
all
amazement
and
surprise
.
<EOS>
I
think
myself
just
sink
into
eternity
,
own
the
divine
justice
of
my
punishment
,
but
not
at
all
feel
any
of
the
move
,
soften
token
of
a
sincere
penitent
;
afflict
at
the
punishment
,
but
not
at
the
crime
;
alarm
at
the
vengeance
,
but
not
terrified
at
the
guilt
;
have
the
same
gust
to
the
crime
,
though
terrify
to
the
last
degree
at
the
thought
of
the
punishment
,
which
I
conclude
I
be
just
now
go
to
receive
.
  
<EOS>
but
perhaps
many
that
read
this
will
be
sensible
of
the
thunder
and
lightning
,
that
may
think
nothing
of
the
rest
,
or
rather
may
make
a
jest
of
it
all
;
so
I
say
no
more
of
it
at
this
time
,
but
proceed
to
the
story
of
the
voyage
.
<EOS>
when
the
amazement
be
over
,
and
the
man
begin
to
come
to
themselves
,
they
fall
a
-
call
for
one
another
,
every
one
for
his
friend
,
or
for
those
he
have
most
respect
for
;
and
it
be
a
singular
satisfaction
to
find
that
nobody
be
hurt
.
<EOS>
the
next
thing
be
to
inquire
if
the
ship
have
receive
no
damage
,
when
the
boatswain
,
step
forward
,
find
that
part
of
the
head
be
go
,
but
not
so
as
to
endanger
the
bowsprit
;
so
we
hoist
our
top
-
sail
again
,
haul
aft
the
fore
-
sheet
,
brace
the
yard
,
and
go
our
course
as
before
.
<EOS>
nor
can
I
deny
but
that
we
be
all
somewhat
like
the
ship
;
our
first
astonishment
be
a
little
over
,
and
that
we
find
the
ship
swim
again
,
we
be
soon
the
same
irreligious
,
harden
crew
that
we
be
before
,
and
I
among
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
now
steer
,
our
course
lie
N.N.E.
,
and
we
pass
thus
,
with
a
fair
wind
,
through
the
strait
or
channel
between
the
island
of
Gilolo
and
the
land
of
Nova
Guinea
,
when
we
be
soon
in
the
open
sea
or
ocean
,
on
the
south
-
east
of
the
Philippines
,
be
the
great
Pacific
,
or
South
Sea
,
where
it
may
be
say
to
join
itself
with
the
vast
Indian
Ocean
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
pass
into
these
sea
,
steer
due
north
,
so
we
soon
cross
the
line
to
the
north
side
,
and
so
sail
on
towards
Mindanao
and
Manilla
,
the
chief
of
the
Philippine
Islands
,
without
meet
with
any
purchase
till
we
come
to
the
northward
of
Manilla
,
and
then
our
trade
begin
;
for
here
we
take
three
japanese
vessel
,
though
at
some
distance
from
Manilla
.
<EOS>
two
of
them
have
make
their
market
,
and
be
go
home
with
nutmeg
,
cinnamon
,
clove
,
&
c.
,
besides
all
sort
of
european
good
,
bring
with
the
spanish
ship
from
Acapulco
.
<EOS>
They
have
together
eight
-
and
-
thirty
ton
of
clove
,
and
five
or
six
ton
of
nutmeg
,
and
as
much
cinnamon
.
<EOS>
We
take
the
spice
,
but
meddle
with
very
little
of
the
european
good
,
they
be
,
as
we
think
,
not
worth
our
while
;
but
we
be
very
sorry
for
it
soon
after
,
and
therefore
grow
wise
upon
the
next
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
Japanese
be
the
good
prize
to
us
;
for
he
come
with
money
,
and
a
great
deal
of
gold
uncoine
,
to
buy
such
good
as
we
mention
above
.
<EOS>
We
ease
him
of
his
gold
,
and
do
him
no
other
harm
,
and
have
no
intention
to
stay
long
here
,
we
stand
away
for
China
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
at
sea
above
two
month
upon
this
voyage
,
beat
it
up
against
the
wind
,
which
blow
steadily
from
the
N.E.
,
and
within
a
point
or
two
one
way
or
other
;
and
this
indeed
be
the
reason
why
we
meet
with
the
more
prize
in
our
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
just
get
clear
of
the
Philippines
,
and
we
purpose
to
go
to
the
isle
of
Formosa
,
but
the
wind
blow
so
fresh
at
N.N.E.
that
there
be
no
make
anything
of
it
,
and
we
be
force
to
put
back
to
Laconia
,
the
most
northerly
of
those
island
.
<EOS>
We
ride
here
very
secure
,
and
shift
our
situation
,
not
in
view
of
any
danger
,
for
there
be
none
,
but
for
a
well
supply
of
provision
,
which
we
find
the
people
very
willing
to
supply
us
with
.
  
<EOS>
there
lay
,
while
we
remain
here
,
three
very
great
galleon
,
or
spanish
ship
,
from
the
south
seas
;
whether
newly
come
in
or
ready
to
sail
we
could
not
understand
at
first
;
but
as
we
find
the
China
trader
begin
to
load
and
set
forward
to
the
north
<EOS>
,
we
conclude
the
spanish
ship
have
newly
unload
their
cargo
,
and
these
have
be
buy
;
so
we
doubt
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
we
should
meet
with
purchase
in
the
rest
of
the
voyage
,
neither
,
indeed
,
could
we
well
miss
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
stay
here
till
the
beginning
of
May
,
when
we
be
tell
the
chinese
trader
would
set
forward
;
for
the
northern
monsoon
end
about
the
latter
end
of
March
or
beginning
of
April
;
so
that
they
be
sure
of
fair
wind
home
.
<EOS>
accordingly
we
hire
some
of
the
country
boat
,
which
be
very
swift
sailer
,
to
go
and
bring
us
word
how
affair
stand
at
Manilla
,
and
when
the
China
junk
would
sail
;
and
by
this
intelligence
we
order
our
matter
so
well
,
that
three
day
after
we
set
sail
we
fall
in
with
no
less
than
eleven
of
them
;
out
of
which
,
however
,
have
by
misfortune
of
discover
ourselves
,
take
but
three
,
we
content
ourselves
and
pursue
our
voyage
to
Formosa
.
<EOS>
in
these
three
vessel
we
take
,
in
short
,
such
a
quantity
of
clove
,
nutmeg
,
cinnamon
,
and
mace
,
besides
silver
,
that
our
man
begin
to
be
of
my
opinion
,
 
that
we
be
rich
enough
;
and
,
in
short
,
we
have
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
consider
by
what
method
to
secure
the
immense
treasure
we
have
get
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
secretly
glad
to
hear
that
they
be
of
this
opinion
,
for
I
have
long
before
resolve
,
if
it
be
possible
,
to
persuade
them
to
think
of
return
,
have
fully
perfect
my
first
project
design
of
rummage
among
the
Spice
Islands
;
and
all
those
prize
,
which
be
exceed
rich
at
Manilla
,
be
quite
beyond
my
design
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
I
have
hear
what
the
man
say
,
and
<EOS>
how
they
think
we
be
very
well
,
I
let
them
know
by
friend
William
,
that
I
intend
only
to
sail
to
the
island
of
Formosa
,
where
I
should
find
opportunity
to
turn
our
spice
and
Europe
good
into
ready
money
,
and
that
then
I
would
tack
about
for
the
south
,
the
northern
monsoon
be
perhaps
by
that
time
also
ready
to
set
in
.
<EOS>
They
all
approve
of
my
design
,
and
willingly
go
forward
;
because
,
besides
the
wind
,
which
would
not
permit
until
October
to
go
to
the
south
,
I
say
,
besides
this
,
we
be
now
a
very
deep
ship
,
have
near
two
hundred
ton
of
good
on
board
,
and
particularly
,
some
very
valuable
;
the
sloop
also
have
a
proportion
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
resolution
we
go
on
cheerfully
,
when
,
within
about
twelve
day
'
sail
more
,
we
make
the
island
Formosa
,
at
a
great
distance
,
but
be
ourselves
shoot
beyond
the
southernmost
part
of
the
island
,
be
to
leeward
,
and
almost
upon
the
coast
of
China
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
a
little
at
a
loss
,
for
the
english
factory
be
not
far
off
,
and
we
may
be
oblige
to
fight
some
of
their
ship
,
if
we
meet
with
them
;
which
,
though
we
be
able
enough
to
do
,
yet
we
do
not
desire
it
on
many
account
,
and
particularly
because
we
do
not
think
it
be
our
business
to
have
it
know
who
we
be
,
or
that
such
a
kind
of
people
as
we
have
be
see
on
the
coast
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
be
oblige
to
keep
to
the
northward
,
keep
as
good
an
offing
as
we
could
with
respect
to
the
coast
of
China
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
not
sail
long
but
we
chase
a
small
chinese
junk
,
and
have
take
her
,
we
find
she
be
bind
to
the
island
of
Formosa
,
have
no
good
on
board
but
some
rice
and
a
small
quantity
of
tea
;
but
she
have
three
chinese
merchant
in
her
;
and
they
tell
us
that
they
be
go
to
meet
a
large
vessel
of
their
country
,
which
come
from
Tonquin
,
and
lie
in
a
river
in
Formosa
,
whose
name
I
forgot
;
and
they
be
go
to
the
Philippine
Islands
,
with
silk
,
muslin
,
calico
,
and
such
good
as
be
the
product
of
China
,
and
some
gold
;
that
their
business
be
to
sell
their
cargo
,
and
buy
spice
and
european
good
.
  
<EOS>
this
suited
very
well
with
our
purpose
;
so
I
resolve
now
that
we
would
leave
off
be
pirate
and
turn
merchant
;
so
we
tell
them
what
good
we
have
on
board
,
and
that
if
they
would
bring
their
supercargo
or
merchant
on
board
,
we
would
trade
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
willing
to
trade
with
us
,
but
terribly
afraid
to
trust
us
;
nor
be
it
an
unjust
fear
,
for
we
have
plunder
them
already
of
what
they
have
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
we
be
as
diffident
as
they
,
and
very
uncertain
what
to
do
;
but
William
the
Quaker
put
this
matter
into
a
way
of
barter
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
me
and
tell
me
he
really
think
the
merchant
look
like
fair
man
,
that
mean
honestly
.
"
<EOS>
and
besides
,
"
say
William
,
"
it
be
their
interest
to
be
honest
now
,
for
,
as
they
know
upon
what
term
we
get
the
good
we
be
to
truck
with
them
,
so
they
know
we
can
afford
good
pennyworth
;
and
in
the
next
place
,
it
save
them
go
the
whole
voyage
,
so
that
the
southerly
monsoon
yet
hold
,
if
they
trade
with
us
,
they
could
immediately
return
with
their
cargo
to
China
;
"
though
,
by
the
way
,
we
afterwards
find
they
intend
for
Japan
;
but
that
be
all
one
,
for
by
this
mean
they
save
at
least
eight
month
'
voyage
.
<EOS>
upon
these
foundation
,
William
say
he
be
satisfied
we
may
trust
them
;
"
for
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
would
as
soon
trust
a
man
whose
interest
bind
him
to
be
just
to
me
as
a
man
whose
principle
bind
himself
.
<EOS>
"
upon
the
whole
,
William
propose
that
two
of
the
merchant
should
be
leave
on
board
our
ship
as
hostage
,
and
that
part
of
our
good
should
be
load
in
their
vessel
,
and
let
the
third
go
with
it
into
the
port
where
their
ship
lie
;
and
when
he
have
deliver
the
spice
,
he
should
bring
back
such
thing
as
it
be
agree
should
be
exchange
.
<EOS>
this
be
conclude
on
,
and
William
the
Quaker
venture
to
go
along
with
them
,
which
,
upon
my
word
,
I
should
not
have
care
to
have
do
,
nor
be
I
willing
that
he
should
,
but
he
go
still
upon
the
notion
that
it
be
their
interest
to
treat
him
friendly
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
we
come
to
an
anchor
under
a
little
island
in
the
latitude
of
23
degree
28
minute
,
be
just
under
the
northern
tropic
,
and
about
twenty
league
from
the
island
.
<EOS>
here
we
lay
thirteen
day
,
and
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
for
my
friend
William
,
for
they
have
promise
to
be
back
again
in
four
day
,
which
they
may
very
easily
have
do
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
the
end
of
thirteen
day
,
we
see
three
sail
come
directly
to
us
,
which
a
little
surprise
us
all
at
first
,
not
know
what
may
be
the
case
;
and
we
begin
to
put
ourselves
in
a
posture
of
defence
;
but
as
they
come
nearer
us
,
we
be
soon
satisfied
,
for
the
first
vessel
<EOS>
be
that
which
William
go
in
,
who
carry
a
flag
of
truce
;
and
in
a
few
hour
they
all
come
to
an
anchor
,
and
William
come
on
board
us
with
a
little
boat
,
with
the
chinese
merchant
in
his
company
,
and
two
other
merchant
,
who
seem
to
be
a
kind
of
broker
for
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
here
he
give
us
an
account
how
civilly
he
have
be
use
;
how
they
have
treat
him
with
all
imaginable
frankness
and
openness
;
that
they
have
not
only
give
him
the
full
value
of
his
spice
and
other
good
which
he
carry
,
in
gold
,
by
good
weight
,
but
have
load
the
vessel
again
with
such
good
as
he
know
we
be
willing
to
trade
for
;
and
that
afterwards
they
have
resolve
to
bring
the
great
ship
out
of
the
harbour
,
to
lie
where
we
be
,
that
so
we
may
make
what
bargain
we
think
fit
;
only
William
say
he
have
promise
,
in
our
name
,
that
we
should
use
no
violence
with
them
,
nor
detain
any
of
the
vessel
after
we
have
do
trading
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
we
would
strive
to
outdo
them
in
civility
,
and
that
we
would
make
good
every
part
of
his
agreement
;
in
token
whereof
,
I
cause
a
white
flag
likewise
to
be
spread
at
the
poop
of
our
great
ship
,
which
be
the
signal
agree
on
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
third
vessel
which
come
with
them
,
it
be
a
kind
of
bark
of
the
country
,
who
,
have
intelligence
of
our
design
to
traffic
,
come
off
to
deal
with
us
,
bring
a
great
deal
of
gold
and
some
provision
,
which
at
that
time
we
be
very
glad
of
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
trade
upon
the
high
sea
with
these
man
,
and
indeed
we
make
a
very
good
market
,
and
yet
sell
thief
'
pennyworth
too
.
<EOS>
We
sell
here
about
sixty
ton
of
spice
,
chiefly
clove
and
nutmeg
,
and
above
two
hundred
bale
of
european
good
,
such
as
linen
and
woollen
manufacture
.
<EOS>
We
consider
we
should
have
occasion
for
some
such
thing
ourselves
,
and
so
we
keep
a
good
quantity
of
english
stuff
,
cloth
,
baize
,
&
c.
,
for
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
take
up
any
of
the
little
room
I
have
leave
here
with
the
further
particular
of
our
trade
;
it
be
enough
to
mention
,
that
,
except
a
parcel
of
tea
,
and
twelve
bale
of
fine
China
work
silk
,
we
take
nothing
in
exchange
for
our
good
but
gold
;
so
that
the
sum
we
take
here
in
that
glitter
commodity
amount
to
above
fifty
thousand
ounce
good
weight
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
finish
our
barter
,
we
restore
the
hostage
,
and
give
the
three
merchant
about
the
quantity
of
twelve
hundredweight
of
nutmeg
,
and
as
many
of
clove
,
with
a
handsome
present
of
european
linen
and
stuff
for
themselves
,
as
a
recompense
for
what
we
have
take
from
them
;
so
we
send
them
away
exceedingly
well
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
here
it
be
that
William
give
me
an
account
,
that
while
he
be
on
board
the
japanese
vessel
,
he
meet
with
a
kind
of
religious
,
or
Japan
priest
,
who
speak
some
word
of
English
to
him
;
and
,
be
very
inquisitive
to
know
how
he
come
to
learn
any
of
those
word
,
he
tell
him
that
there
be
in
his
country
thirteen
englishman
;
he
call
them
Englishmen
very
articulately
and
distinctly
,
for
he
have
converse
with
them
very
frequently
and
freely
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
they
be
all
that
be
leave
of
two
-
and
-
thirty
man
,
who
come
on
shore
on
the
north
side
of
Japan
,
be
drive
upon
a
great
rock
in
a
stormy
night
,
where
they
lose
their
ship
,
and
the
rest
of
their
man
be
drown
;
that
he
have
persuade
the
king
of
his
country
to
send
boat
off
to
the
rock
or
island
where
the
ship
be
lose
,
to
save
the
rest
of
the
man
,
and
to
bring
them
on
shore
,
which
be
do
,
and
they
be
use
very
kindly
,
and
have
house
build
for
them
,
and
land
give
them
to
plant
for
provision
;
and
that
they
live
by
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
he
go
frequently
among
them
,
to
persuade
them
to
worship
their
god
(
an
idol
,
I
suppose
,
of
their
own
making
)
,
which
,
he
say
,
they
ungratefully
refuse
;
and
that
therefore
the
king
have
once
or
twice
order
them
all
to
be
put
to
death
;
but
that
,
as
he
say
,
he
have
prevail
upon
the
king
to
spare
them
,
and
let
them
live
their
own
way
,
as
long
as
they
be
quiet
and
peaceable
,
and
do
not
go
about
to
withdraw
other
from
the
worship
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
William
why
he
do
not
inquire
from
whence
they
come
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
say
William
;
"
for
how
could
I
but
think
it
strange
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
hear
him
talk
of
Englishmen
on
the
north
side
of
Japan
?
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
account
do
he
give
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
an
account
,
"
say
William
,
"
that
will
surprise
thee
,
and
all
the
world
after
thee
,
that
shall
hear
of
it
,
and
which
make
me
wish
thou
wouldst
go
up
to
Japan
and
find
them
out
.
"

what
do
you
mean
?
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
Whence
could
they
come
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
William
,
"
he
pull
out
a
little
book
,
and
in
it
a
piece
of
paper
,
where
it
be
write
,
in
an
Englishman
's
hand
,
and
in
plain
english
word
,
thus
;
and
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
read
it
myself
:
 
<EOS>
"
We
come
from
Greenland
,
and
from
the
North
Pole
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
be
amazing
to
us
all
,
and
more
so
to
those
seaman
among
us
who
know
anything
of
the
infinite
attempt
which
have
be
make
from
Europe
,
as
well
by
the
English
as
the
Dutch
,
to
discover
a
passage
that
way
into
those
part
of
the
world
;
and
as
William
press
as
earnestly
to
go
on
to
the
north
to
rescue
those
poor
man
,
so
the
ship
's
company
begin
to
incline
to
it
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
we
all
come
to
this
,
that
we
would
stand
in
to
the
shore
of
Formosa
,
to
find
this
priest
again
,
and
have
a
further
account
of
it
all
from
him
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
sloop
go
over
;
but
when
they
come
there
,
the
vessel
be
very
unhappily
sail
,
and
this
put
an
end
to
our
inquiry
after
them
,
and
perhaps
may
have
disappoint
mankind
of
one
of
the
most
noble
discovery
that
ever
be
make
,
or
will
again
be
make
,
in
the
world
,
for
the
good
of
mankind
in
general
;
but
so
much
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
William
be
so
uneasy
at
lose
this
opportunity
,
that
he
press
us
earnestly
to
go
up
to
Japan
to
find
out
these
man
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
that
if
it
be
nothing
but
to
recover
thirteen
honest
poor
man
from
a
kind
of
captivity
,
which
they
would
otherwise
never
be
redeem
from
,
and
where
,
perhaps
,
they
may
,
some
time
or
other
,
be
murder
by
the
barbarous
people
,
in
defence
of
their
idolatry
,
it
be
very
well
worth
our
while
,
and
it
would
be
,
in
some
measure
,
make
amend
for
the
mischief
we
have
do
in
the
world
;
but
<EOS>
we
,
that
have
no
concern
upon
us
for
the
mischief
we
have
do
,
have
much
less
about
any
satisfaction
to
be
make
for
it
,
so
he
find
that
kind
of
discourse
would
weigh
very
little
with
us
.
<EOS>
then
he
press
us
very
earnestly
to
let
him
have
the
sloop
to
go
by
himself
,
and
I
tell
him
I
would
not
oppose
it
;
but
when
he
come
to
the
sloop
none
of
the
man
would
go
with
him
;
for
the
case
be
plain
,
they
have
all
a
share
in
the
cargo
of
the
great
ship
,
as
well
as
in
thae
of
the
sloop
,
and
the
richness
of
the
cargo
be
such
that
they
would
not
leave
it
by
any
mean
;
so
poor
William
,
much
to
his
mortification
,
be
oblige
to
give
it
over
.
<EOS>
what
become
of
those
thirteen
man
,
or
whether
they
be
not
there
still
,
I
can
give
no
account
of
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
at
the
end
of
our
cruise
;
what
we
have
take
be
indeed
so
considerable
,
that
it
be
not
only
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
covetous
and
the
most
ambitious
mind
in
the
world
,
but
it
do
indeed
satisfy
us
,
and
our
man
declare
they
do
not
desire
any
more
.
<EOS>
the
next
motion
,
therefore
,
be
about
go
back
,
and
the
way
by
which
we
should
perform
the
voyage
,
so
as
not
to
be
attack
by
the
Dutch
in
the
Straits
of
Sunda
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
pretty
well
store
ourselves
here
with
provision
,
and
it
be
now
near
the
return
of
the
monsoon
,
we
resolve
to
stand
away
to
the
southward
;
and
not
only
to
keep
without
the
Philippine
Islands
,
that
be
to
say
,
to
the
eastward
of
them
,
but
to
keep
on
to
the
southward
,
and
see
if
we
could
not
leave
not
only
the
Moluccas
,
or
Spice
Islands
,
behind
us
,
but
even
Nova
Guinea
and
Nova
Hollandia
also
;
and
so
get
into
the
variable
wind
,
to
the
south
of
the
tropic
of
Capricorn
,
steer
away
to
the
west
,
over
the
great
Indian
Ocean
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
at
first
a
monstrous
voyage
in
its
appearance
,
and
the
want
of
provision
threaten
us
.
<EOS>
William
tell
us
in
so
many
word
,
that
it
be
impossible
we
could
carry
provision
enough
to
subsist
us
for
such
a
voyage
,
and
especially
fresh
water
;
and
that
,
as
there
would
be
no
land
for
us
to
touch
at
where
we
could
get
any
supply
,
it
be
a
madness
to
undertake
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
undertake
to
remedy
this
evil
,
and
therefore
desire
them
not
to
be
uneasy
at
that
,
for
I
know
that
we
may
supply
ourselves
at
Mindanao
,
the
most
southerly
island
of
the
Philippines
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
set
sail
,
have
take
all
the
provision
here
that
we
could
get
,
the
28th
of
September
,
the
wind
veer
a
little
at
first
from
the
N.N.W.
to
the
N.E.
by
E.
,
but
afterwards
settle
about
the
N.E.
and
the
E.N.E.
We
<EOS>
be
nine
week
in
this
voyage
,
have
meet
with
several
interruption
by
the
weather
,
and
put
in
under
the
lee
of
a
small
island
in
the
latitude
of
16
degree
12
minute
,
of
which
we
never
know
the
name
,
none
of
our
chart
have
give
any
account
of
it
:
I
say
,
we
put
in
here
by
reason
of
a
strange
tornado
or
hurricane
,
which
bring
us
into
a
great
deal
of
danger
.
<EOS>
here
we
ride
about
sixteen
day
,
the
wind
be
very
tempestuous
and
the
weather
uncertain
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
get
some
provision
on
shore
,
such
as
plant
and
root
,
and
a
few
hog
.
<EOS>
We
believe
there
be
inhabitant
on
the
island
,
but
we
see
none
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
from
hence
,
the
weather
settle
again
,
we
go
on
and
come
to
the
southernmost
part
of
Mindanao
,
where
we
take
in
fresh
water
and
some
cow
,
but
the
climate
be
so
hot
that
we
do
not
attempt
to
salt
up
any
more
than
so
as
to
keep
a
fortnight
or
three
week
;
and
away
we
stand
southward
,
cross
the
line
,
and
,
leave
Gillolo
on
the
starboard
side
<EOS>
,
we
coast
the
country
they
call
New
Guinea
,
where
,
in
the
latitude
of
eight
degree
south
,
we
put
in
again
for
provision
and
water
,
and
where
we
find
inhabitant
;
but
they
flee
from
us
,
and
be
altogether
inconversable
.
<EOS>
from
thence
,
sailing
still
southward
,
we
leave
all
behind
us
that
any
of
our
chart
and
map
take
any
notice
of
,
and
go
on
till
we
come
to
the
latitude
of
seventeen
degree
,
the
wind
continue
still
north
-
east
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
make
land
to
the
westward
,
which
,
when
we
have
keep
in
sight
for
three
day
,
coast
along
the
shore
for
the
distance
of
about
four
league
,
we
begin
to
fear
we
should
find
no
outlet
west
,
and
so
should
be
oblige
to
go
back
again
,
and
put
in
among
the
Moluccas
at
last
;
but
at
length
we
find
the
land
break
off
,
and
go
trend
away
to
the
west
sea
,
seem
to
be
all
open
to
the
south
and
south
-
west
,
and
a
great
sea
come
roll
out
of
the
south
,
which
give
us
to
understand
that
there
be
no
land
for
a
great
way
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
keep
on
our
course
to
the
south
,
a
little
westerly
,
till
we
pass
the
south
tropic
,
where
we
find
the
wind
variable
;
and
now
we
stand
away
fair
west
,
and
hold
it
out
for
about
twenty
day
,
when
we
discover
land
right
ahead
,
and
on
our
larboard
bow
;
we
make
directly
to
the
shore
,
be
willing
to
take
all
advantage
now
for
supply
ourselves
with
fresh
provision
and
water
,
know
we
be
now
enter
on
that
vast
unknown
Indian
Ocean
,
perhaps
the
great
sea
on
the
globe
,
have
,
with
very
little
interruption
of
island
,
a
continued
sea
quite
round
the
globe
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
a
good
road
here
,
and
some
people
on
shore
;
but
when
we
land
,
they
flee
up
the
country
,
nor
would
they
hold
any
correspondence
with
us
,
nor
come
near
us
,
but
shoot
at
us
several
time
with
arrow
as
long
as
lance
.
<EOS>
We
set
up
white
flag
for
a
truce
,
but
they
either
do
not
or
would
not
understand
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
they
shoot
our
flag
of
truce
through
several
time
with
their
arrow
,
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
we
never
come
near
any
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
good
water
here
,
though
it
be
something
difficult
to
get
at
it
,
but
for
live
creature
we
could
see
none
;
for
the
people
,
if
they
have
any
cattle
,
drive
them
all
away
,
and
show
us
nothing
but
themselves
,
and
that
sometimes
in
a
threatening
posture
,
and
in
number
so
great
,
that
make
us
suppose
the
island
to
be
great
than
we
first
imagine
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
they
would
not
come
near
enough
for
us
to
engage
with
them
,
at
least
not
openly
;
but
they
come
near
enough
for
us
to
see
them
,
and
,
by
the
help
of
our
glass
,
to
see
that
they
be
clothe
and
arm
,
but
their
clothe
be
only
about
their
low
and
middle
part
;
that
they
have
long
lance
,
half
pike
,
in
their
hand
,
besides
bow
and
arrow
;
that
they
have
great
high
thing
on
their
head
,
make
,
as
we
believe
,
of
feather
,
and
which
look
something
like
our
grenadier
'
cap
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
see
them
so
shy
that
they
would
not
come
near
us
,
our
man
begin
to
range
over
the
island
,
if
it
be
such
(
for
we
never
surround
it
)
,
to
search
for
cattle
,
and
for
any
of
the
indian
plantation
,
for
fruit
or
plant
;
but
they
soon
find
,
to
their
cost
,
that
they
be
to
use
more
caution
than
that
come
to
,
and
that
they
be
to
discover
perfectly
every
bush
and
every
tree
before
they
venture
abroad
in
the
country
;
for
about
fourteen
of
our
man
go
farther
than
the
rest
,
into
a
part
of
the
country
which
seem
to
be
plant
,
as
they
think
,
for
it
do
but
seem
so
,
only
I
think
it
be
overgrow
with
cane
,
such
as
we
make
our
cane
chair
with
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
venture
too
far
,
they
be
suddenly
attack
with
a
shower
of
arrow
from
almost
every
side
of
them
,
as
they
think
,
out
of
the
top
of
the
tree
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
fly
for
it
,
which
,
however
,
they
could
not
resolve
on
,
till
five
of
them
be
wound
;
nor
have
they
escape
so
,
if
one
of
them
have
not
be
so
much
wise
or
thoughtfuller
than
the
rest
,
as
to
consider
,
that
though
they
could
not
see
the
enemy
,
so
as
to
shoot
at
them
,
yet
perhaps
the
noise
of
their
shot
may
terrify
them
,
and
that
they
should
rather
fire
at
a
venture
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
ten
of
them
face
about
,
and
fire
at
random
anywhere
among
the
cane
.
  
<EOS>
the
noise
and
the
fire
not
only
terrify
the
enemy
,
but
,
as
they
believe
,
their
shot
have
luckily
hit
some
of
them
;
for
they
find
not
only
that
the
arrow
,
which
come
thick
among
them
before
,
cease
,
but
they
hear
the
Indians
halloo
,
after
their
way
,
to
one
another
,
and
make
a
strange
noise
,
more
uncouth
and
inimitably
strange
than
any
they
have
ever
hear
,
more
like
the
howling
and
barking
of
wild
creature
in
the
wood
than
like
the
voice
of
man
,
only
that
sometimes
they
seem
to
speak
word
.
  
<EOS>
They
observe
also
,
that
this
noise
of
the
Indians
go
farther
and
farther
off
,
so
that
they
be
satisfied
the
Indians
flee
away
,
except
on
one
side
,
where
they
hear
a
doleful
groaning
and
howling
,
and
where
it
continue
a
good
while
,
which
they
suppose
be
from
some
or
other
of
them
be
wound
,
and
howl
by
reason
of
their
wound
;
or
kill
,
and
other
howl
over
them
:
but
our
man
have
enough
of
make
discovery
;
so
they
do
not
trouble
themselves
to
look
farther
,
but
resolve
to
take
this
opportunity
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
but
the
bad
of
their
adventure
be
to
come
;
for
as
they
come
back
,
they
pass
by
a
prodigious
great
trunk
of
an
old
tree
;
what
tree
it
be
,
they
say
,
they
do
not
know
,
but
it
stand
like
an
old
decayed
oak
in
a
park
,
where
the
keeper
in
England
take
a
stand
,
as
they
call
it
,
to
shoot
a
deer
;
and
it
stand
just
under
the
steep
side
of
a
great
rock
,
or
hill
,
that
our
people
could
not
see
what
be
beyond
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
come
by
this
tree
,
they
be
of
a
sudden
shot
at
,
from
the
top
of
the
tree
,
with
seven
arrow
and
three
lance
,
which
,
to
our
great
grief
,
kill
two
of
our
man
,
and
wound
three
more
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
more
surprising
,
because
,
be
without
any
defence
,
and
so
near
the
tree
,
they
expect
more
lance
and
arrow
every
moment
;
nor
would
fly
do
them
any
service
,
the
Indians
be
,
as
appear
,
very
good
marksman
.
<EOS>
in
this
extremity
,
they
have
happily
this
presence
of
mind
,
viz
.
,
to
run
close
to
the
tree
,
and
stand
,
as
it
be
,
under
it
;
so
that
those
above
could
not
come
at
,
or
see
them
,
to
throw
their
lance
at
them
.
<EOS>
this
succeed
,
and
give
them
time
to
consider
what
to
do
;
they
know
their
enemy
and
murderer
be
above
;
they
hear
them
talk
,
and
those
above
know
those
be
below
;
but
they
below
be
oblige
to
keep
close
for
fear
of
their
lance
from
above
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
one
of
our
man
,
look
a
little
more
strictly
than
the
rest
,
think
he
see
the
head
of
one
of
the
Indians
just
over
a
dead
limb
of
the
tree
,
which
,
it
seem
,
the
creature
sit
upon
.
<EOS>
one
man
immediately
fire
,
and
level
his
piece
so
true
that
the
shot
go
through
the
fellow
's
head
;
and
down
he
fall
out
of
the
tree
immediately
,
and
come
upon
the
ground
with
such
force
,
with
the
height
of
his
fall
,
that
if
he
have
not
be
kill
with
the
shot
,
he
would
certainly
have
be
kill
with
dash
his
body
against
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
this
so
frighten
them
,
that
,
besides
the
howl
noise
they
make
in
the
tree
,
our
man
hear
a
strange
clutter
of
them
in
the
body
of
the
tree
,
from
whence
they
conclude
they
have
make
the
tree
hollow
,
and
be
get
to
hide
themselves
there
.
<EOS>
now
,
have
this
be
the
case
,
they
be
secure
enough
from
our
man
,
for
it
be
impossible
<EOS>
any
of
our
man
could
get
up
the
tree
on
the
outside
,
there
be
no
branch
to
climb
by
;
and
,
to
shoot
at
the
tree
,
that
they
try
several
time
to
no
purpose
,
for
the
tree
<EOS>
be
so
thick
that
no
shot
would
enter
it
.
<EOS>
They
make
no
doubt
,
however
,
but
that
they
have
their
enemy
in
a
trap
,
and
that
a
small
siege
would
either
bring
them
down
,
tree
and
all
,
or
starve
them
out
;
so
they
resolve
to
keep
their
post
,
and
send
to
us
for
help
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
two
of
them
come
away
to
us
for
more
hand
,
and
particularly
desire
that
some
of
our
carpenter
may
come
with
tool
,
to
help
to
cut
down
the
tree
,
or
at
least
to
cut
down
other
wood
and
set
fire
to
it
;
and
that
,
they
conclude
,
would
not
fail
to
bring
them
out
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
our
man
go
like
a
little
army
,
and
with
mighty
preparation
for
an
enterprise
,
the
like
of
which
have
scarce
be
ever
hear
,
to
form
the
siege
of
a
great
tree
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
they
come
there
,
they
find
the
task
difficult
enough
,
for
the
old
trunk
be
indeed
a
very
great
one
,
and
very
tall
,
be
at
least
two
-
and
-
twenty
foot
high
,
with
seven
old
limb
stand
out
every
way
from
the
top
,
but
decay
,
and
very
few
leave
,
if
any
,
leave
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
William
the
Quaker
,
whose
curiosity
lead
him
to
go
among
the
rest
,
propose
that
they
should
make
a
ladder
,
and
get
upon
the
top
,
and
then
throw
wild
-
fire
into
the
tree
,
and
smoke
them
out
.
<EOS>
other
propose
go
back
,
and
get
a
great
gun
out
of
the
ship
,
which
would
split
the
tree
in
piece
with
the
iron
bullet
;
other
,
that
they
should
cut
down
a
great
deal
of
wood
,
and
pile
it
up
round
the
tree
,
and
set
it
on
fire
,
and
burn
the
tree
,
and
the
Indians
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
these
consultation
take
up
our
people
no
less
than
two
or
three
day
,
in
all
which
time
they
hear
nothing
of
the
suppose
garrison
within
this
wooden
castle
,
nor
any
noise
within
.
<EOS>
William
's
project
be
first
go
about
,
and
a
large
strong
ladder
be
make
,
to
scale
this
wooden
tower
;
and
in
two
or
three
hour
'
time
it
would
have
be
ready
to
mount
,
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
they
hear
the
noise
of
the
Indians
in
the
body
of
the
tree
again
,
and
a
little
after
,
several
of
them
appear
at
the
top
of
the
tree
,
and
throw
some
lance
down
at
our
man
;
one
of
which
strike
one
of
our
seaman
a
-
top
of
the
shoulder
,
and
give
him
such
a
desperate
wound
,
that
the
surgeon
not
only
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
to
cure
him
,
but
the
poor
man
endure
such
horrible
torture
,
that
we
all
say
they
have
better
have
kill
him
outright
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
cure
at
last
,
though
he
never
recover
the
perfect
use
of
his
arm
,
the
lance
have
cut
some
of
the
tendon
on
the
top
of
the
arm
,
near
the
shoulder
,
which
,
as
I
suppose
,
perform
the
office
of
motion
to
the
limb
before
;
so
that
the
poor
man
be
a
cripple
all
the
day
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
desperate
rogue
in
the
tree
;
our
man
shoot
at
them
,
but
do
not
find
they
have
hit
them
,
or
any
of
them
;
but
as
soon
as
ever
they
shoot
at
them
,
they
could
hear
them
huddle
down
into
the
trunk
of
the
tree
again
,
and
there
,
to
be
sure
,
they
be
safe
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
however
,
it
be
this
which
put
by
the
project
of
William
's
ladder
;
for
when
it
be
do
,
who
would
venture
up
among
such
a
troop
of
bold
creature
as
be
there
,
and
who
,
they
suppose
,
be
desperate
by
their
circumstance
?
<EOS>
and
as
but
one
man
at
a
time
could
go
up
,
they
begin
to
think
it
would
not
do
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
be
of
the
opinion
(
for
about
this
time
I
be
come
to
their
assistance
)
<EOS>
that
go
up
the
ladder
would
not
do
,
unless
it
be
thus
,
that
a
man
should
,
as
it
be
,
run
just
up
to
the
top
,
and
throw
some
firework
into
the
tree
,
and
come
down
again
;
and
this
we
do
two
or
three
time
,
but
find
no
effect
of
it
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
one
of
our
gunner
make
a
stink
-
pot
,
as
we
call
it
,
be
a
composition
which
only
smoke
,
but
do
not
flame
or
burn
;
but
withal
the
smoke
of
it
be
so
thick
,
and
the
smell
of
it
so
intolerably
nauseous
,
that
it
be
not
to
be
suffer
.
<EOS>
this
he
throw
into
the
tree
himself
,
and
we
wait
for
the
effect
of
it
,
but
hear
or
see
nothing
all
that
night
or
the
next
day
;
so
we
conclude
the
man
within
be
all
smother
;
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
the
next
night
we
hear
them
upon
the
top
of
the
tree
again
shout
and
halloo
like
madman
.
  
<EOS>
We
conclude
,
as
anybody
would
,
that
this
be
to
call
for
help
,
and
we
resolve
to
continue
our
siege
;
for
we
be
all
enrage
to
see
ourselves
so
baulk
by
a
few
wild
people
,
whom
we
think
we
have
safe
in
our
clutch
;
and
,
indeed
,
never
be
there
so
many
concur
circumstance
to
delude
man
in
any
case
we
have
meet
with
.
<EOS>
We
resolve
,
however
,
to
try
another
stink
-
pot
the
next
night
,
and
our
engineer
and
gunner
have
get
it
ready
,
when
,
hear
a
noise
of
the
enemy
on
the
top
of
the
tree
,
and
in
the
body
of
the
tree
,
I
be
not
willing
to
let
the
gunner
go
up
the
ladder
,
<EOS>
which
,
I
say
,
would
be
but
to
be
certain
of
be
murder
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
find
a
medium
for
it
,
and
that
be
to
go
up
a
few
step
,
and
,
with
a
long
pole
in
his
hand
,
to
throw
it
in
upon
the
top
of
the
tree
,
the
ladder
be
stand
all
this
while
against
the
top
of
the
tree
;
but
when
the
gunner
,
with
his
machine
at
the
top
of
his
pole
,
come
to
the
tree
,
with
three
other
man
to
help
him
,
behold
the
ladder
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
this
perfectly
confound
us
;
and
we
now
conclude
the
Indians
in
the
tree
have
,
by
this
piece
of
negligence
,
take
the
opportunity
,
and
come
all
down
the
ladder
,
make
their
escape
,
and
have
carry
away
the
ladder
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
laugh
most
heartily
at
my
friend
William
,
who
,
as
I
say
,
have
the
direction
of
the
siege
,
and
have
set
up
a
ladder
for
the
garrison
,
as
we
call
them
,
to
get
down
upon
,
and
run
away
.
<EOS>
but
when
daylight
come
,
we
be
all
set
to
right
again
;
for
there
stand
our
ladder
,
haul
up
on
the
top
of
the
tree
,
with
about
half
of
it
in
the
hollow
of
the
tree
,
and
the
other
half
upright
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
then
we
begin
to
laugh
at
the
Indians
for
fool
,
that
they
could
not
as
well
have
find
their
way
down
by
the
ladder
,
and
have
make
their
escape
,
as
to
have
pull
it
up
by
main
strength
into
the
tree
.
  
<EOS>
We
then
resolve
upon
fire
,
and
so
to
put
an
end
to
the
work
at
once
,
and
burn
the
tree
and
its
inhabitant
together
;
and
accordingly
we
go
to
work
to
cut
wood
,
and
in
a
few
hour
'
time
we
get
enough
,
as
we
think
,
together
;
and
,
pile
it
up
round
the
bottom
of
the
tree
<EOS>
,
we
set
it
on
fire
,
wait
at
a
distance
to
see
when
,
the
gentleman
's
quarter
be
too
hot
for
them
,
they
would
come
fly
out
at
the
top
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
quite
confound
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
we
find
the
fire
all
put
out
by
a
great
quantity
of
water
throw
upon
it
.
<EOS>
We
then
think
the
devil
must
be
in
them
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
say
William
,
"
this
be
certainly
the
cunning
piece
of
indian
engineering
that
ever
be
hear
of
;
and
there
can
be
but
one
thing
more
to
guess
at
,
besides
witchcraft
and
deal
with
the
devil
,
which
I
believe
not
one
word
of
,
"
say
he
;
"
and
that
must
be
,
that
this
be
an
artificial
tree
,
or
a
natural
tree
artificially
make
hollow
down
into
the
earth
,
through
root
and
all
;
and
that
these
creature
have
an
artificial
cavity
underneath
it
,
quite
into
the
hill
,
or
a
way
to
go
through
,
and
under
the
hill
,
to
some
other
place
;
and
where
that
other
place
be
,
we
know
not
;
but
if
it
be
not
our
own
fault
,
I
will
find
the
place
,
and
follow
them
into
it
,
before
I
be
two
day
old
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
then
call
the
carpenter
,
to
know
of
them
if
they
have
any
large
saw
that
would
cut
through
the
body
;
and
they
tell
him
they
have
no
saw
that
be
long
enough
,
nor
could
man
work
into
such
a
monstrous
old
stump
in
a
great
while
;
but
that
they
would
go
to
work
with
it
with
their
axis
,
and
undertake
to
cut
it
down
in
two
day
,
and
stock
up
the
root
of
it
in
two
more
.
<EOS>
but
William
be
for
another
way
,
which
prove
much
well
than
all
this
;
for
he
be
for
silent
work
,
that
,
if
possible
,
he
may
catch
some
of
the
fellow
in
it
.
<EOS>
so
he
set
twelve
man
to
it
with
large
auger
,
to
bore
great
hole
into
the
side
of
the
tree
,
to
go
almost
through
,
but
not
quite
through
;
which
hole
be
bore
without
noise
,
and
when
they
be
do
he
fill
them
all
with
gunpowder
,
stop
strong
plug
,
bolt
crossway
,
into
the
hole
,
and
then
bore
a
slanting
hole
,
of
a
less
size
,
down
into
the
great
hole
,
all
of
which
be
fill
with
powder
,
and
at
once
blow
up
.
<EOS>
when
they
take
fire
,
they
make
such
a
noise
,
and
tear
and
split
up
the
tree
in
so
many
place
,
and
in
such
a
manner
,
that
we
could
see
plainly
such
another
blast
would
demolish
it
;
and
so
it
do
.
<EOS>
thus
at
the
second
time
we
could
,
at
two
or
three
place
,
put
our
hand
in
them
,
and
discover
a
cheat
,
namely
,
that
there
be
a
cave
or
hole
dig
into
the
earth
,
from
or
through
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
,
and
that
it
have
communication
with
another
cave
farther
in
,
where
we
hear
the
voice
of
several
of
the
wild
folk
,
call
and
talk
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
thus
far
we
have
a
great
mind
to
get
at
them
;
and
William
desire
that
three
man
may
be
give
him
with
hand
-
grenadoe
;
and
he
promise
to
go
down
first
,
and
boldly
he
do
so
;
for
William
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
have
the
heart
of
a
lion
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
pistol
in
their
hand
,
and
sword
by
their
side
;
but
,
as
they
have
teach
the
Indians
before
by
their
stink
-
pot
,
the
Indians
return
them
in
their
own
kind
;
for
they
make
such
a
smoke
come
up
out
of
the
entrance
into
the
cave
or
hollow
,
that
William
and
his
three
man
be
glad
to
come
run
out
of
the
cave
,
and
out
of
the
tree
too
,
for
mere
want
of
breath
;
and
indeed
they
be
almost
stifle
.
  
<EOS>
never
be
a
fortification
so
well
defended
,
or
assailant
<EOS>
so
many
way
defeat
.
<EOS>
We
be
now
for
give
it
over
,
and
particularly
I
call
William
,
and
tell
him
I
could
not
but
laugh
to
see
us
spin
out
our
time
here
for
nothing
;
that
I
could
not
imagine
what
we
be
do
;
that
it
be
certain
that
the
rogue
that
be
in
it
be
cunning
to
the
last
degree
,
and
it
would
vex
anybody
to
be
so
baulk
by
a
few
naked
ignorant
fellow
;
but
still
it
be
not
worth
our
while
to
push
it
any
further
,
nor
be
there
anything
that
I
know
of
to
be
get
by
the
conquest
when
it
be
make
,
so
that
I
think
it
high
time
to
give
it
over
.
  
<EOS>
William
acknowledge
what
I
say
be
just
,
and
that
there
be
nothing
but
our
curiosity
to
be
gratify
in
this
attempt
;
and
though
,
as
he
say
,
he
be
very
desirous
to
have
search
into
the
thing
,
yet
he
would
not
insist
upon
it
;
so
we
resolve
to
quit
it
and
come
away
,
which
we
do
.
<EOS>
however
,
William
say
before
we
go
he
would
have
this
satisfaction
of
them
,
viz
.
,
to
burn
down
the
tree
and
stop
up
the
entrance
into
the
cave
.
<EOS>
and
while
do
this
the
gunner
tell
him
he
would
have
one
satisfaction
of
the
rogue
;
and
this
be
,
that
he
would
make
a
mine
of
it
,
and
see
which
way
it
have
vent
.
<EOS>
upon
this
he
fetch
two
barrel
of
powder
out
of
the
ship
,
and
place
them
in
the
inside
of
the
hollow
of
the
cave
,
as
far
in
as
he
durst
go
to
carry
them
,
and
then
fill
up
the
mouth
of
the
cave
where
the
tree
stand
,
and
ram
it
sufficiently
hard
,
leave
only
a
pipe
or
touch
-
hole
,
he
give
fire
to
it
,
and
stand
at
a
distance
to
see
which
way
it
would
operate
,
when
on
a
sudden
he
find
the
force
of
the
powder
burst
its
way
out
among
some
bush
on
the
other
side
the
little
hill
I
mention
,
and
that
it
come
roar
out
there
as
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
.
<EOS>
immediately
run
thither
,
we
see
the
effect
of
the
powder
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
we
see
that
there
be
the
other
mouth
of
the
cave
,
which
the
powder
have
so
tear
and
open
,
that
the
loose
earth
be
so
fallen
in
again
that
nothing
of
shape
could
be
discern
;
<EOS>
but
there
we
see
what
be
become
of
the
garrison
of
the
Indians
,
too
,
who
have
give
us
all
this
trouble
,
for
some
of
them
have
no
arm
,
some
no
leg
,
some
no
head
;
some
lie
half
bury
in
the
rubbish
of
the
mine
 
that
be
to
say
,
in
the
loose
earth
that
fall
in
;
and
,
in
short
,
there
be
a
miserable
havoc
make
in
them
all
;
for
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
not
one
of
them
that
be
in
the
inside
could
escape
,
but
rather
be
shoot
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
like
a
bullet
out
of
a
gun
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
now
our
full
satisfaction
of
the
Indians
;
but
,
in
short
,
this
be
a
losing
voyage
,
for
we
have
two
man
kill
,
one
quite
crippled
,
and
five
more
wounded
;
we
spend
two
barrel
of
powder
,
and
eleven
day
'
time
,
and
all
to
get
the
understanding
how
to
make
an
indian
mine
,
or
how
to
keep
garrison
in
a
hollow
tree
;
and
with
this
wit
,
buy
at
this
dear
price
<EOS>
,
we
come
away
,
have
take
in
some
fresh
water
,
but
get
no
fresh
provision
.
  
<EOS>
We
then
consider
what
we
should
do
to
get
back
again
to
Madagascar
.
<EOS>
We
be
much
about
the
latitude
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
but
have
such
a
very
long
run
,
and
be
neither
sure
of
meet
with
fair
wind
nor
with
any
land
in
the
way
,
that
we
know
not
what
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
William
be
our
last
resort
in
this
case
again
,
and
he
be
very
plain
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
friend
,
"
say
he
to
Captain
Wilmot
,
"
what
occasion
hast
thou
to
run
the
venture
of
starve
,
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
say
thou
hast
be
where
nobody
have
be
before
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
many
place
nearer
home
,
of
which
thou
mayest
say
the
same
thing
at
less
expense
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
occasion
thou
hast
of
keep
thus
far
south
any
longer
than
till
you
be
sure
you
be
to
the
west
end
of
Java
and
Sumatra
;
and
then
thou
mayest
stand
away
north
towards
Ceylon
,
and
the
coast
of
Coromandel
and
Madras
,
where
thou
mayest
get
both
fresh
water
and
fresh
provision
;
and
to
that
part
it
be
likely
we
may
hold
out
well
enough
with
the
store
we
have
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
wholesome
advice
,
and
such
as
be
not
to
be
slight
;
so
we
stand
away
to
the
west
,
keep
between
the
latitude
of
31
and
35
,
and
have
very
good
weather
and
fair
wind
for
about
ten
day
'
sail
;
by
which
time
,
by
our
reckoning
,
we
be
clear
of
the
isle
,
and
may
run
away
to
the
north
;
and
if
we
do
not
fall
in
with
Ceylon
,
we
should
at
least
go
into
the
great
deep
Bay
of
Bengal
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
be
out
in
our
reckon
a
great
deal
;
for
,
when
we
have
stand
due
north
for
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
degree
,
we
meet
with
land
again
on
our
starboard
bow
,
about
three
league
'
distance
;
so
we
come
to
an
anchor
about
half
a
league
from
it
,
and
man
out
our
boat
to
see
what
sort
of
a
country
it
be
.
<EOS>
We
find
it
a
very
good
one
;
fresh
water
easy
to
come
at
,
but
no
cattle
that
we
could
see
,
or
inhabitant
;
and
we
be
very
shy
of
search
too
far
after
them
,
lest
we
should
make
such
another
journey
as
we
do
last
;
so
that
we
let
ramble
alone
,
and
choose
rather
to
take
what
we
could
find
,
which
be
only
a
few
wild
mango
,
and
some
plant
of
several
kind
,
which
we
know
not
the
name
of
.
  
<EOS>
We
make
no
stay
here
,
but
put
to
sea
again
,
N.W.
by
N.
,
but
have
little
wind
for
a
fortnight
more
,
when
we
make
land
again
;
and
stand
in
with
the
shore
,
we
be
surprised
to
find
ourselves
on
the
south
shore
of
Java
;
and
just
as
we
be
come
to
an
anchor
we
see
a
boat
,
carry
dutch
colour
,
sail
along
-
shore
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
solicitous
to
speak
with
them
,
or
any
other
of
their
nation
,
but
leave
it
indifferent
to
our
people
,
when
they
go
on
shore
,
to
see
the
dutchman
or
not
to
see
them
;
our
business
be
to
get
provision
,
which
,
indeed
,
by
this
time
be
very
short
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
resolve
to
go
on
shore
with
our
boat
in
the
most
convenient
place
we
could
find
,
and
to
look
out
a
proper
harbour
to
bring
the
ship
into
,
leave
it
to
our
fate
whether
we
should
meet
with
friend
or
enemy
;
<EOS>
resolving
,
however
,
not
to
stay
any
considerable
time
,
at
least
not
long
enough
to
have
express
send
across
the
island
to
Batavia
,
and
for
ship
to
come
round
from
thence
to
attack
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
,
accord
to
our
desire
,
a
very
good
harbour
,
where
we
ride
in
seven
fathom
water
,
well
defend
from
the
weather
,
whatever
may
happen
;
and
here
we
get
fresh
provision
,
such
as
good
hog
and
some
cow
;
and
that
we
may
lay
in
a
little
store
,
we
kill
sixteen
cow
,
and
pickle
and
barrel
up
the
flesh
as
well
as
we
could
be
suppose
to
do
in
the
latitude
of
eight
degree
from
the
line
.
  
<EOS>
We
do
all
this
in
about
five
day
,
and
fill
our
cask
with
water
;
and
the
last
boat
be
come
off
with
herb
and
root
,
we
be
unmoore
,
and
<EOS>
our
fore
-
topsail
loose
for
sailing
,
when
we
spy
a
large
ship
to
the
northward
,
bear
down
directly
upon
us
.
<EOS>
We
know
not
what
she
may
be
,
but
conclude
the
bad
,
and
make
all
possible
haste
to
get
our
anchor
up
,
and
get
under
sail
,
that
we
may
be
in
a
readiness
to
see
what
she
have
to
say
to
us
,
for
we
be
under
no
great
concern
for
one
ship
,
but
our
notion
be
,
that
we
should
be
attack
by
three
or
four
together
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
we
have
get
up
our
anchor
and
the
boat
be
stow
,
the
ship
be
within
a
league
of
us
,
and
,
as
we
think
,
bear
down
to
engage
us
;
so
we
spread
our
black
flag
,
or
ancient
,
on
the
poop
,
and
the
bloody
flag
at
the
top
-
mast
-
head
,
and
have
make
a
clear
ship
,
we
stretch
away
to
the
westward
,
to
get
the
wind
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
,
it
seem
,
quite
mistake
us
before
,
expect
nothing
of
an
enemy
or
a
pirate
in
those
sea
;
and
,
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
we
have
be
one
of
their
own
ship
<EOS>
,
they
seem
to
be
in
some
confusion
when
they
find
their
mistake
,
so
they
immediately
haul
upon
a
wind
on
the
other
tack
,
and
stand
edge
in
for
the
shore
,
towards
the
easternmost
part
of
the
island
.
<EOS>
upon
this
we
tack
,
and
stand
after
him
with
all
the
sail
we
could
,
and
in
two
hour
come
almost
within
gunshot
.
<EOS>
though
they
crowd
all
the
sail
they
could
lay
on
,
there
be
no
remedy
but
to
engage
us
,
and
they
soon
see
their
inequality
of
force
.
<EOS>
We
fire
a
gun
for
them
to
bring
to
;
so
they
man
out
their
boat
,
and
send
to
us
with
a
flag
of
truce
.
<EOS>
We
send
back
the
boat
,
but
with
this
answer
to
the
captain
,
that
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
strike
and
bring
his
ship
to
an
anchor
under
our
stern
,
and
come
on
board
us
himself
,
when
he
should
know
our
demand
;
but
that
,
however
,
since
he
have
not
yet
put
us
to
the
trouble
of
force
him
,
which
we
see
we
be
able
to
do
,
we
assure
them
that
the
captain
should
return
again
in
safety
,
and
all
his
man
,
and
that
,
supply
us
with
such
thing
as
we
should
demand
,
his
ship
should
not
be
plunder
.
<EOS>
They
go
back
with
this
message
,
and
it
be
some
time
after
they
be
on
board
before
they
strike
,
which
make
us
begin
to
think
they
refuse
it
;
so
we
fire
a
shot
,
and
in
a
few
minute
more
we
perceive
their
boat
put
off
;
and
as
soon
as
the
boat
put
off
the
ship
strike
and
come
to
an
anchor
,
as
be
direct
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
captain
come
on
board
,
we
demand
an
account
of
their
cargo
,
which
be
chiefly
bale
of
good
from
Bengal
for
Bantam
.
<EOS>
We
tell
them
our
present
want
be
provision
,
which
they
have
no
need
of
,
be
just
at
the
end
of
their
voyage
;
and
that
,
if
they
would
send
their
boat
on
shore
with
ours
,
and
procure
us
six
-
and
-
twenty
head
of
black
cattle
,
threescore
hog
,
a
quantity
of
brandy
and
arrack
,
and
three
hundred
bushel
of
rice
,
we
would
let
them
go
free
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
rice
,
they
give
us
six
hundred
bushel
,
which
they
have
actually
on
board
,
together
with
a
parcel
ship
upon
freight
.
<EOS>
also
,
they
give
us
thirty
middling
cask
of
very
good
arrack
,
but
beef
and
pork
they
have
none
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
go
on
shore
with
our
man
,
and
buy
eleven
bullock
and
fifty
hog
,
which
be
pickle
up
for
our
occasion
;
and
upon
the
supply
of
provision
from
shore
,
we
dismiss
them
and
their
ship
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
here
several
day
before
we
could
furnish
ourselves
with
the
provision
agree
for
,
and
some
of
the
man
fancy
the
dutchman
be
contrive
our
destruction
;
but
they
be
very
honest
,
and
do
what
they
could
to
furnish
the
black
cattle
,
but
find
it
impossible
to
supply
so
many
.
<EOS>
so
they
come
and
tell
us
ingenuously
,
that
,
unless
we
could
stay
a
while
longer
,
they
could
get
no
more
oxen
or
cow
than
those
eleven
,
with
which
we
be
oblige
to
be
satisfied
,
take
the
value
of
them
in
other
thing
,
rather
than
stay
longer
there
.
<EOS>
on
our
side
,
we
be
punctual
with
them
in
observe
the
condition
we
have
agree
on
;
nor
would
we
let
any
of
our
man
so
much
as
go
on
board
them
,
or
suffer
any
of
their
man
to
come
on
board
us
;
for
,
have
any
of
our
man
go
on
board
,
nobody
could
have
answer
for
their
behaviour
,
any
more
than
if
they
have
be
on
shore
in
an
enemy
's
country
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
victual
for
our
voyage
;
and
,
as
we
matter
not
purchase
,
we
go
merrily
on
for
the
coast
of
Ceylon
,
where
we
intend
to
touch
,
to
get
fresh
water
again
,
and
more
provision
;
and
we
have
nothing
material
offer
in
this
part
of
the
voyage
,
only
that
we
meet
with
contrary
wind
,
and
be
above
a
month
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
We
put
in
upon
the
south
coast
of
the
island
,
desire
to
have
as
little
to
do
with
the
Dutch
as
we
could
;
and
as
the
Dutch
be
lord
of
the
country
as
to
commerce
,
so
they
be
more
so
of
the
sea
-
coast
,
where
they
have
several
fort
,
and
,
in
particular
,
have
all
the
cinnamon
,
which
be
the
trade
of
that
island
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
in
fresh
water
here
,
and
some
provision
,
but
do
not
much
trouble
ourselves
about
lay
in
any
store
,
our
beef
and
hog
,
which
we
get
at
Java
,
<EOS>
be
not
yet
all
go
by
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
little
skirmish
on
shore
here
with
some
of
the
people
of
the
island
,
some
of
our
man
have
be
a
little
too
familiar
with
the
homely
lady
of
the
country
;
for
homely
,
indeed
,
they
be
,
to
such
a
degree
,
that
if
our
man
have
not
have
good
stomach
that
way
,
they
would
scarce
have
touch
any
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
never
fully
get
it
out
of
our
man
<EOS>
what
they
do
,
they
be
so
true
to
one
another
in
their
wickedness
,
but
I
understand
in
the
main
,
that
it
be
some
barbarous
thing
they
have
do
,
and
that
they
have
like
to
have
pay
dear
for
it
,
for
the
man
resent
it
to
the
last
degree
,
and
gather
in
such
number
about
them
,
that
,
have
not
sixteen
more
of
our
man
,
in
another
boat
,
come
all
in
the
nick
of
time
,
just
to
rescue
our
first
man
,
who
be
but
eleven
,
and
so
fetch
them
off
by
main
force
<EOS>
,
they
have
be
all
cut
off
,
the
inhabitant
be
no
less
than
two
or
three
hundred
,
arm
with
dart
and
lance
,
the
usual
weapon
of
the
country
,
and
which
they
be
very
dexterous
at
the
throwing
,
even
so
dexterous
that
it
be
scarce
credible
;
and
have
our
man
stand
to
fight
them
,
as
some
of
them
be
bold
enough
to
talk
of
,
they
have
be
all
overwhelmed
and
kill
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
seventeen
of
our
man
be
wound
,
and
some
of
them
very
dangerously
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
more
fright
than
hurt
too
,
for
every
one
of
them
give
themselves
over
for
dead
man
,
believe
the
lance
be
poison
.
<EOS>
but
William
be
our
comfort
here
too
;
for
,
when
two
of
our
surgeon
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
and
tell
the
man
foolishly
enough
that
they
would
die
,
William
cheerfully
go
to
work
with
them
,
and
cure
them
all
but
one
,
who
rather
die
by
drink
some
arrack
punch
than
of
his
wound
;
the
excess
of
drink
throw
him
into
a
fever
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
enough
of
Ceylon
,
though
some
of
our
people
be
for
go
ashore
again
,
sixty
or
seventy
man
together
,
to
be
revenge
;
but
William
persuade
them
against
it
;
and
his
reputation
be
so
great
among
the
man
,
as
well
as
with
us
that
be
commander
,
that
he
could
influence
them
more
than
any
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
mighty
warm
upon
their
revenge
,
and
they
would
go
on
shore
,
and
destroy
five
hundred
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
William
,
"
and
suppose
you
do
,
what
be
you
the
well
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
one
of
them
,
speak
for
the
rest
,
"
we
shall
have
our
satisfaction
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
what
will
you
be
the
well
for
that
?
"
say
William
.
<EOS>
They
could
then
say
nothing
to
that
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
"
say
William
,
"
if
I
mistake
not
,
your
business
be
money
;
now
,
I
desire
to
know
,
if
you
conquer
and
kill
two
or
three
thousand
of
these
poor
creature
,
they
have
no
money
,
pray
what
will
you
get
?
<EOS>
They
be
poor
naked
wretch
;
what
shall
you
gain
by
them
?
<EOS>
but
then
,
"
say
William
,
"
perhaps
,
in
do
this
,
you
may
chance
to
lose
half
-
a
-
score
of
your
own
company
,
as
it
be
very
probable
you
may
.
<EOS>
pray
,
what
gain
be
in
it
?
<EOS>
and
what
account
can
you
give
the
captain
for
his
lose
man
?
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
William
argue
so
effectually
,
that
he
convince
them
that
it
be
mere
murder
to
do
so
;
and
that
the
man
have
a
right
to
their
own
,
and
that
they
have
no
right
to
take
them
away
;
that
it
be
destroy
innocent
man
,
who
have
act
no
otherwise
than
as
the
law
of
nature
dictate
;
and
that
it
would
be
as
much
murder
to
do
so
,
as
to
meet
a
man
on
the
highway
,
and
kill
him
,
for
the
mere
sake
of
it
,
in
cold
blood
,
not
regard
whether
he
have
do
any
wrong
to
us
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
these
reason
prevail
with
them
at
last
,
and
they
be
content
to
go
away
,
and
leave
them
as
they
find
them
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
skirmish
they
kill
between
sixty
and
seventy
man
,
and
wound
a
great
many
more
;
but
they
have
nothing
,
and
our
people
get
nothing
by
it
,
but
the
loss
of
one
man
's
life
,
and
the
wounding
sixteen
more
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
but
another
accident
bring
us
to
a
necessity
of
further
business
with
these
people
,
and
indeed
we
have
like
to
have
put
an
end
to
our
life
and
adventure
all
at
once
among
them
;
for
,
about
three
day
after
our
put
out
to
sea
from
the
place
where
we
have
that
skirmish
,
we
be
attack
by
a
violent
storm
of
wind
from
the
south
,
or
rather
a
hurricane
of
wind
from
all
the
point
southward
,
for
it
blow
in
a
most
desperate
and
furious
manner
from
the
S.E.
to
the
S.W.
,
<EOS>
one
minute
at
one
point
,
and
then
instantly
turn
about
again
to
another
point
,
but
with
the
same
violence
;
nor
be
we
able
to
work
the
ship
in
that
condition
,
so
that
the
ship
I
be
in
split
three
top
-
sail
,
and
at
last
bring
the
main
-
top
-
mast
by
the
board
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
we
be
once
or
twice
drive
right
ashore
;
and
one
time
,
have
not
the
wind
shift
the
very
moment
it
do
<EOS>
,
we
have
be
dash
in
a
thousand
piece
upon
a
great
ledge
of
rock
which
lie
off
about
half
-
a
-
league
from
the
shore
;
but
,
as
I
have
say
,
the
wind
shift
very
often
,
and
at
that
time
come
to
the
E.S.E.
,
we
stretch
off
,
and
get
above
a
league
more
sea
-
room
in
half
-
an
-
hour
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
it
blow
with
some
fury
S.W.
by
S.
,
then
S.W.
by
W.
,
and
put
us
back
again
a
great
way
to
the
eastward
of
the
ledge
of
rock
,
where
we
find
a
great
opening
between
the
rock
and
the
land
,
and
endeavour
to
come
to
an
anchor
there
,
but
we
find
there
be
no
ground
fit
to
anchor
in
,
and
that
we
should
lose
our
anchor
,
there
be
nothing
but
rock
.
<EOS>
We
stand
through
the
opening
,
which
hold
about
four
league
.
<EOS>
the
storm
continue
,
and
now
we
find
a
dreadful
foul
shore
,
and
know
not
what
course
to
take
.
<EOS>
We
look
out
very
narrowly
for
some
river
or
creek
or
bay
,
where
we
may
run
in
,
and
come
to
an
anchor
,
but
find
none
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
at
length
we
see
a
great
headland
lie
out
far
south
into
the
sea
,
and
that
to
such
a
length
,
that
,
in
short
,
we
see
plainly
that
,
if
the
wind
hold
where
it
be
,
we
could
not
weather
it
,
so
we
run
in
as
much
under
the
lee
of
the
point
as
we
could
,
and
come
to
an
anchor
in
about
twelve
fathom
water
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
wind
veer
again
in
the
night
,
and
blow
exceedingly
hard
,
our
anchor
come
home
,
and
the
ship
drive
till
the
rudder
strike
against
the
ground
;
and
have
the
ship
go
half
her
length
<EOS>
farther
she
have
be
lose
,
and
every
one
of
us
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
our
sheet
-
anchor
hold
its
own
,
and
we
heave
in
some
of
the
cable
,
to
get
clear
of
the
ground
we
have
strike
upon
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
this
only
cable
that
we
ride
it
out
all
night
;
and
towards
morning
we
think
the
wind
abate
a
little
;
and
it
be
well
for
us
that
it
be
so
,
for
,
<EOS>
in
spite
of
what
our
sheet
-
anchor
do
for
us
,
we
find
the
ship
fast
aground
in
the
morning
,
to
our
very
great
surprise
and
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
tide
be
out
,
though
the
water
here
ebb
away
,
the
ship
lie
almost
dry
upon
a
bank
of
hard
sand
,
which
never
,
I
suppose
,
have
any
ship
upon
it
before
.
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
country
come
down
in
great
number
to
look
at
us
and
gaze
,
not
know
what
we
be
,
but
gape
at
us
as
at
a
great
sight
or
wonder
at
which
they
be
surprised
,
and
know
not
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
upon
the
sight
they
immediately
send
an
account
of
a
ship
be
there
,
and
of
the
condition
we
be
in
,
for
the
next
day
there
appear
a
great
man
;
whether
it
be
their
king
or
no
I
know
not
,
but
he
have
abundance
of
man
with
him
,
and
some
with
long
javelin
in
their
hand
as
long
as
half
-
pike
;
and
these
come
all
down
to
the
water
's
edge
,
and
draw
up
in
a
very
good
order
,
just
in
our
view
.
<EOS>
They
stand
near
an
hour
without
make
any
motion
;
and
then
there
come
near
twenty
of
them
,
with
a
man
before
them
carry
a
white
flag
.
<EOS>
They
come
forward
into
the
water
as
high
as
their
waist
,
the
sea
not
go
so
high
as
before
,
for
the
wind
be
abate
,
and
blow
off
the
shore
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
make
a
long
oration
to
us
,
as
we
could
see
by
his
gesture
;
and
we
sometimes
hear
his
voice
,
but
know
not
one
word
he
say
.
<EOS>
William
,
who
be
always
useful
to
us
,
<EOS>
I
believe
be
here
again
the
saving
of
all
our
life
.
<EOS>
the
case
be
this
:
<EOS>
the
fellow
,
or
what
I
may
call
him
,
when
his
speech
be
do
,
give
three
great
scream
(
for
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
else
to
say
they
be
)
,
then
lower
his
white
flag
three
time
,
and
then
make
three
motion
to
us
with
his
arm
to
come
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
that
I
be
for
man
out
the
boat
and
go
to
them
,
but
William
would
by
no
mean
allow
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
we
ought
to
trust
nobody
;
that
,
if
they
be
barbarian
,
and
under
their
own
government
,
we
may
be
sure
to
be
all
murder
;
and
,
if
they
be
Christians
,
we
should
not
fare
much
better
,
if
they
know
who
we
be
;
that
it
be
the
custom
of
the
Malabars
to
betray
all
people
that
they
could
get
into
their
hand
,
and
that
these
be
some
of
the
same
people
;
and
that
,
if
we
have
any
regard
to
our
own
safety
,
we
should
not
go
to
them
by
any
mean
.
<EOS>
I
oppose
him
a
great
while
,
and
tell
him
I
think
he
use
to
be
always
right
,
but
that
now
I
think
he
be
not
;
that
I
be
no
more
for
run
needless
risk
than
he
or
any
one
else
;
but
I
think
all
nation
in
the
world
,
even
the
most
savage
people
,
when
they
hold
out
a
flag
of
peace
,
keep
the
offer
of
peace
make
by
that
signal
very
sacredly
;
and
I
give
him
several
example
of
it
in
the
history
of
my
african
travel
,
which
I
have
here
go
through
in
the
beginning
of
this
work
,
and
that
I
could
not
think
these
people
bad
than
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
I
tell
him
our
case
seem
to
be
such
that
we
must
fall
into
somebody
's
hand
or
other
,
and
that
we
have
well
fall
into
their
hand
by
a
friendly
treaty
than
by
a
force
submission
,
nay
,
though
they
have
indeed
a
treacherous
design
;
and
therefore
I
be
for
a
parley
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
friend
,
"
say
William
very
gravely
,
"
if
thou
wilt
go
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
;
I
shall
only
desire
to
take
my
last
leave
of
thee
at
parting
,
for
,
depend
upon
it
,
thou
wilt
never
see
us
again
.
<EOS>
whether
we
in
the
ship
may
come
off
any
better
at
last
I
can
not
resolve
thee
;
but
this
I
will
answer
for
,
that
we
will
not
give
up
our
life
idly
,
and
in
cool
blood
,
as
thou
art
go
to
do
;
we
will
at
least
preserve
ourselves
as
long
as
we
can
,
and
die
at
last
like
man
,
not
like
fool
,
trepan
by
the
wile
of
a
few
barbarian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
William
speak
this
with
so
much
warmth
,
and
yet
with
so
much
assurance
of
our
fate
,
that
I
begin
to
think
a
little
of
the
risk
I
be
go
to
run
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
mind
to
be
murder
than
he
;
and
yet
I
could
not
for
my
life
be
so
faint
-
hearted
in
the
thing
as
he
.
<EOS>
upon
which
I
ask
him
if
he
have
any
knowledge
of
the
place
,
or
have
ever
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
no
.
<EOS>
then
I
ask
him
if
he
have
hear
or
read
anything
about
the
people
of
this
island
,
and
of
their
way
of
treat
any
Christians
that
have
fall
into
their
hand
;
and
he
tell
me
he
have
hear
of
one
,
and
he
would
tell
me
the
story
afterward
.
<EOS>
His
name
,
he
say
,
be
Knox
,
commander
of
an
East
India
ship
,
who
be
drive
on
shore
,
just
as
we
be
,
upon
this
island
of
Ceylon
,
though
he
could
not
say
it
be
at
the
same
place
,
or
whereabout
;
that
he
be
beguile
by
the
barbarian
,
and
entice
to
come
on
shore
,
just
as
we
be
invite
to
do
at
that
time
;
and
that
,
when
they
have
him
,
they
surround
him
,
and
eighteen
or
twenty
of
his
man
,
and
never
suffer
them
to
return
,
but
keep
them
prisoner
,
or
murder
them
,
he
could
not
tell
which
;
but
they
be
carry
away
up
into
the
country
,
separate
from
one
another
,
and
never
hear
of
afterwards
,
except
the
captain
's
son
,
who
miraculously
make
his
escape
,
after
twenty
year
'
slavery
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
then
to
ask
him
to
give
the
full
story
of
this
Knox
,
much
less
to
hear
him
tell
it
me
;
but
,
as
it
be
usual
in
such
case
,
when
one
begin
to
be
a
little
touched
,
I
turn
short
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
friend
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
would
you
have
us
do
?
<EOS>
You
see
what
condition
we
be
in
,
and
what
be
before
us
;
something
must
be
do
,
and
that
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
will
tell
thee
what
thou
shalt
do
;
first
,
cause
a
white
flag
to
be
hang
out
,
as
they
do
to
us
,
and
man
out
the
longboat
and
pinnace
with
as
many
man
as
they
can
well
stow
,
to
handle
their
arm
,
and
let
me
go
with
them
,
and
thou
shalt
see
what
we
will
do
.
<EOS>
if
I
miscarry
,
thou
mayest
be
safe
;
and
I
will
also
tell
thee
,
that
if
I
do
miscarry
,
it
shall
be
my
own
fault
,
and
thou
shalt
learn
wit
by
my
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
reply
to
him
at
first
;
but
,
after
some
pause
,
I
say
,
"
William
,
William
,
I
be
as
both
you
should
be
lose
as
you
be
that
I
should
;
and
if
there
be
any
danger
,
I
desire
you
may
no
more
fall
into
it
than
I.
<EOS>
therefore
,
if
you
will
,
let
us
all
keep
in
the
ship
,
fare
alike
,
and
take
our
fate
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
William
,
"
there
be
no
danger
in
the
method
I
propose
;
thou
shalt
go
with
me
,
if
thou
thinkest
fit
.
<EOS>
if
thou
pleasest
but
to
follow
the
measure
that
I
shall
resolve
on
,
depend
upon
it
,
though
we
will
go
off
from
the
ship
,
we
will
not
a
man
of
us
go
any
nearer
them
than
within
call
to
talk
with
them
.
<EOS>
Thou
seest
they
have
no
boat
to
come
off
to
us
;
but
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
rather
desire
thou
wouldst
take
my
advice
,
and
manage
the
ship
as
I
shall
give
the
signal
from
the
boat
,
and
let
us
concert
that
matter
together
before
we
go
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
find
William
have
his
measure
in
his
head
all
lay
beforehand
,
and
be
not
at
a
loss
what
to
do
at
all
;
so
I
tell
him
he
should
be
captain
for
this
voyage
,
and
we
would
be
all
of
us
under
his
order
,
which
I
would
see
observe
to
a
tittle
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
conclusion
of
our
debate
,
he
order
four
-
and
-
twenty
man
into
the
long
-
boat
,
and
twelve
man
into
the
pinnace
,
and
the
sea
be
now
pretty
smooth
<EOS>
,
they
go
off
,
be
all
very
well
armed
.
<EOS>
also
he
order
that
all
the
gun
of
the
great
ship
,
on
the
side
which
lie
next
the
shore
,
should
be
load
with
musket
-
ball
,
old
nail
,
stub
,
and
such
-
like
piece
of
old
iron
,
lead
,
and
anything
that
come
to
hand
;
and
that
we
should
prepare
to
fire
as
soon
as
ever
we
see
them
low
the
white
flag
and
hoist
up
a
red
one
in
the
pinnace
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
measure
fix
between
us
,
they
go
off
towards
the
shore
,
William
in
the
pinnace
with
twelve
man
,
and
the
long
-
boat
come
after
him
with
four
-
and
-
twenty
more
,
all
stout
resolute
fellow
,
and
very
well
armed
.
<EOS>
They
row
so
near
the
shore
as
that
they
may
speak
to
one
another
,
carry
a
white
flag
,
as
the
other
do
,
and
offer
a
parley
.
<EOS>
the
brute
,
for
such
they
be
,
show
themselves
very
courteous
;
but
find
we
could
not
understand
them
,
they
fetch
an
old
Dutchman
,
who
have
be
their
prisoner
many
year
,
and
set
him
to
speak
to
us
.
<EOS>
the
sum
and
substance
of
his
speech
be
,
that
the
king
of
the
country
have
send
his
general
down
to
know
who
we
be
,
and
what
our
business
be
.
<EOS>
William
stand
up
in
the
stern
of
the
pinnace
,
and
tell
him
,
that
as
to
that
,
he
,
that
be
an
European
,
by
his
language
and
voice
,
may
easily
know
what
we
be
,
and
our
condition
;
the
ship
be
aground
upon
the
sand
would
also
tell
him
that
our
business
there
be
that
of
a
ship
in
distress
;
so
William
desire
to
know
what
they
come
down
for
with
such
a
multitude
,
and
with
arm
and
weapon
,
as
if
they
come
to
war
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
He
answer
,
they
may
have
good
reason
to
come
down
to
the
shore
,
the
country
be
alarm
with
the
appearance
of
ship
of
stranger
upon
the
coast
;
and
as
our
vessel
be
full
of
man
,
and
as
we
have
gun
and
weapon
,
the
king
have
send
part
of
his
military
man
,
that
,
in
case
of
any
invasion
upon
the
country
,
they
may
be
ready
to
defend
themselves
,
whatsoever
may
be
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
you
be
man
in
distress
,
the
king
have
order
his
general
,
who
be
here
also
,
to
give
you
all
the
assistance
he
can
,
and
to
invite
you
on
shore
,
and
receive
you
with
all
possible
courtesy
.
"
<EOS>
say
William
,
very
quick
upon
him
,
"
before
I
give
thee
an
answer
to
that
,
I
desire
thee
to
tell
me
what
thou
art
,
for
by
thy
speech
thou
art
an
European
.
"
<EOS>
He
answer
presently
,
he
be
a
dutchman
.
"
<EOS>
that
I
know
well
,
"
say
William
,
"
by
thy
speech
;
but
art
thou
a
native
Dutchman
of
Holland
,
or
a
native
of
this
country
,
that
have
learn
Dutch
by
converse
among
the
Hollanders
,
who
we
know
be
settle
upon
this
island
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
I
be
a
native
of
Delft
,
in
the
province
of
Holland
,
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
William
,
immediately
,
"
but
art
thou
a
Christian
or
a
heathen
,
or
<EOS>
what
we
call
a
renegado
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
they
go
on
,
in
a
short
dialogue
,
as
follow
:
    
William
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
a
Dutchman
,
and
a
Christian
,
thou
sayest
;
pray
,
art
thou
<EOS>
a
freeman
or
a
servant
?
  
<EOS>
Dutchman
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
servant
to
the
king
here
,
and
in
his
army
.
  
<EOS>
W.
but
art
thou
<EOS>
a
volunteer
,
or
a
prisoner
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
a
prisoner
at
first
,
but
be
at
liberty
now
,
and
so
be
a
volunteer
.
  
<EOS>
W.
that
be
to
say
,
be
first
a
prisoner
,
thou
hast
liberty
to
serve
them
;
but
art
thou
<EOS>
so
at
liberty
that
thou
mayest
go
away
,
if
thou
pleasest
,
to
thine
<EOS>
own
countryman
?
  
<EOS>
D.
no
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
say
so
;
my
countryman
live
a
great
way
off
,
on
the
north
and
east
part
of
the
island
,
and
there
be
no
go
to
them
without
the
king
's
express
license
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Well
,
and
why
dost
thou
not
get
a
license
to
go
away
?
  
<EOS>
D.
I
have
never
ask
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
W.
<EOS>
and
,
I
suppose
,
if
thou
didst
,
thou
knowest
thou
couldst
not
obtain
it
.
  
<EOS>
D.
I
can
not
say
much
as
to
that
;
but
why
do
you
ask
me
all
these
question
?
  
<EOS>
W.
Why
,
my
reason
be
good
;
if
thou
art
a
Christian
and
a
prisoner
,
how
canst
thou
consent
to
be
make
an
instrument
to
these
barbarian
,
to
betray
us
into
their
hand
,
who
be
thy
countryman
and
fellow
-
Christians
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
a
barbarous
thing
in
thee
to
do
so
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
how
do
I
go
about
to
betray
you
?
<EOS>
do
I
not
give
you
an
account
how
the
king
invite
you
to
come
on
shore
,
and
have
order
you
to
be
treat
courteously
and
assist
?
  
<EOS>
W.
<EOS>
as
thou
art
a
Christian
,
though
I
doubt
it
much
,
dost
thou
believe
the
king
or
the
general
,
as
thou
callest
it
,
mean
one
word
of
what
he
say
?
  
<EOS>
D.
He
promise
you
by
the
mouth
of
his
great
general
.
  
<EOS>
W.
I
do
not
ask
thee
what
he
promise
,
or
by
whom
;
but
I
ask
thee
this
:
<EOS>
Canst
thou
say
that
thou
believ
<EOS>
he
intend
to
perform
it
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
how
can
I
answer
that
?
<EOS>
how
can
I
tell
what
he
intend
?
  
<EOS>
W.
Thou
canst
tell
what
thou
believ
.
  
<EOS>
D.
I
can
not
say
but
he
will
perform
it
;
I
believe
he
may
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Thou
art
but
a
double
-
tongued
Christian
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
come
,
I
will
ask
thee
another
question
:
wilt
thou
say
that
thou
believ
it
,
and
that
thou
wouldst
advise
me
to
believe
it
,
and
put
our
life
into
their
hand
upon
these
promise
?
  
<EOS>
D.
I
be
not
to
be
your
adviser
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Thou
art
perhaps
afraid
to
speak
thy
mind
,
because
thou
art
in
their
power
.
<EOS>
pray
,
do
any
of
them
understand
what
thou
<EOS>
and
I
say
?
<EOS>
Can
they
speak
Dutch
?
  
<EOS>
D.
no
,
not
one
of
them
;
I
have
no
apprehension
upon
that
account
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Why
,
then
,
answer
me
plainly
,
if
thou
art
a
Christian
:
be
it
safe
for
us
to
venture
upon
their
word
,
to
put
ourselves
into
their
hand
,
and
come
on
shore
?
  
<EOS>
D.
You
put
it
very
home
to
me
.
<EOS>
pray
let
me
ask
you
another
question
:
be
you
in
any
likelihood
of
get
your
ship
off
,
if
you
refuse
it
?
  
<EOS>
W.
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
we
shall
get
off
the
ship
;
now
the
storm
be
over
<EOS>
we
do
not
fear
it
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
then
I
can
not
say
it
be
good
for
you
to
trust
them
.
  
<EOS>
W.
well
,
it
be
honestly
say
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
but
what
shall
I
say
to
them
?
  
<EOS>
W.
give
them
good
word
,
as
they
give
us
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
what
good
word
?
  
<EOS>
W.
Why
,
let
them
tell
the
king
that
we
be
stranger
,
who
be
drive
on
his
coast
by
a
great
storm
;
that
we
thank
him
very
kindly
for
his
offer
of
civility
to
us
,
which
,
if
we
be
further
distressed
,
we
will
accept
thankfully
;
but
that
at
present
we
have
no
occasion
to
come
on
shore
;
and
besides
,
that
we
can
not
safely
leave
the
ship
in
the
present
condition
she
be
in
;
but
that
we
be
oblige
to
take
care
of
her
,
in
order
to
get
her
off
;
and
expect
,
in
a
tide
or
two
more
,
to
get
her
quite
clear
,
and
at
an
anchor
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
but
he
will
expect
you
to
come
on
shore
,
then
,
to
visit
him
,
and
make
him
some
present
for
his
civility
.
  
<EOS>
W.
<EOS>
when
we
have
get
our
ship
clear
,
and
stop
the
leak
,
we
will
pay
our
respect
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
D.
Nay
,
you
may
as
well
come
to
him
now
as
then
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Nay
,
hold
,
friend
;
I
do
not
say
we
would
come
to
him
then
:
you
talk
of
make
him
a
present
,
that
be
to
pay
our
respect
to
him
,
be
it
not
?
  
<EOS>
D.
well
,
but
I
will
tell
him
that
you
will
come
on
shore
to
him
when
your
ship
be
get
off
.
  
<EOS>
W.
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
that
;
you
may
tell
him
what
you
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
but
he
will
be
in
a
great
rage
if
I
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
W.
who
will
he
be
in
a
great
rage
at
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
at
you
.
  
<EOS>
W.
what
occasion
have
we
to
value
that
?
  
<EOS>
D.
why
,
he
will
send
all
his
army
down
against
you
.
  
<EOS>
W.
<EOS>
and
what
if
they
be
all
here
just
now
?
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
suppose
they
could
do
to
us
?
  
<EOS>
D.
He
would
expect
they
should
burn
your
ship
and
bring
you
all
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
W.
tell
him
,
if
he
should
try
,
he
may
catch
a
Tartar
.
  
<EOS>
D.
He
have
a
world
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
W.
have
he
any
ship
?
  
<EOS>
D.
no
,
he
have
no
ship
.
  
<EOS>
W.
nor
boat
?
  
<EOS>
D.
no
,
nor
boat
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Why
,
what
then
do
you
think
we
care
for
his
man
?
<EOS>
what
canst
thou
do
now
to
us
,
if
thou
hadst
a
hundred
thousand
with
thee
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
they
may
set
you
on
fire
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Set
us
<EOS>
a
-
firing
,
thou
mean
;
that
they
may
indeed
;
but
set
us
on
fire
they
shall
not
;
they
may
try
,
at
their
peril
,
and
we
shall
make
mad
work
with
your
hundred
thousand
man
,
if
they
come
within
reach
of
our
gun
,
I
assure
thee
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
but
what
if
the
king
give
you
hostage
for
your
safety
?
  
<EOS>
W.
Whom
can
he
give
but
mere
slave
and
servant
like
thyself
,
whose
life
he
no
more
value
than
we
an
English
hound
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
Whom
do
you
demand
for
hostage
?
  
<EOS>
W.
Himself
and
your
worship
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
what
would
you
do
with
him
?
  
<EOS>
W.
do
with
him
as
he
would
do
with
us
 
cut
his
head
off
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
and
what
would
you
do
with
me
?
  
<EOS>
W.
do
with
thee
?
<EOS>
We
would
carry
thee
home
into
thine
own
country
;
and
,
though
thou
deservest
the
gallow
,
we
would
make
a
man
and
a
Christian
of
thee
again
,
and
not
do
by
thee
as
thou
wouldst
have
do
by
us
 
betray
thee
to
a
parcel
of
merciless
,
savage
pagan
,
that
know
no
God
,
nor
how
to
show
mercy
to
man
.
  
<EOS>
D.
You
put
a
thought
in
my
head
that
I
will
speak
to
you
about
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
thus
they
go
away
,
and
William
come
on
board
,
and
give
us
a
full
account
of
his
parley
with
the
old
Dutchman
,
which
be
very
diverting
,
and
to
me
instruct
;
for
I
have
abundance
of
reason
to
acknowledge
William
have
make
a
well
judgment
of
thing
than
I.
  
<EOS>
It
be
our
good
fortune
to
get
our
ship
off
that
very
night
,
and
to
bring
her
to
an
anchor
at
about
a
mile
and
a
half
farther
out
,
and
in
deep
water
,
to
our
great
satisfaction
;
so
that
we
have
no
need
to
fear
the
Dutchman
's
king
,
with
his
hundred
thousand
man
;
and
indeed
we
have
some
sport
with
them
the
next
day
,
when
they
come
down
,
a
vast
prodigious
multitude
of
them
,
very
few
less
in
number
,
in
our
imagination
,
than
a
hundred
thousand
,
with
some
elephant
;
though
,
if
it
have
be
an
army
of
elephant
,
they
could
have
do
us
no
harm
;
for
we
be
fairly
at
our
anchor
now
,
and
out
of
their
reach
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
we
think
ourselves
more
out
of
their
reach
than
we
really
be
;
and
it
be
ten
thousand
to
one
that
we
have
not
be
fast
aground
again
,
for
the
wind
blow
off
shore
,
though
it
make
the
water
smooth
where
we
lay
,
yet
it
blow
the
ebb
farther
out
than
usual
,
and
we
could
easily
perceive
the
sand
,
which
we
touch
upon
before
,
lie
in
the
shape
of
a
half
-
moon
,
and
surround
us
with
two
horn
of
it
,
so
that
we
lay
in
the
middle
or
centre
of
it
,
as
in
a
round
bay
,
safe
just
as
we
be
,
and
in
deep
water
,
but
present
death
,
as
it
be
,
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
,
for
the
two
horn
or
point
of
the
sand
reach
out
beyond
where
our
ship
lie
near
two
mile
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
part
of
the
sand
which
lie
on
our
east
side
,
this
misguided
multitude
extend
themselves
;
and
be
,
most
of
them
,
not
above
their
knee
,
or
most
of
them
not
above
ankle
<EOS>
-
deep
in
the
water
,
they
as
it
be
surround
us
on
that
side
,
and
on
the
side
of
the
mainland
,
and
a
little
way
on
the
other
side
of
the
sand
,
stand
in
a
half
-
circle
,
or
rather
three
-
fifth
of
a
circle
,
for
about
six
mile
in
length
.
<EOS>
the
other
horn
,
or
point
of
the
sand
,
which
lie
on
our
west
side
,
be
not
quite
so
shallow
,
they
could
not
extend
themselves
upon
it
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
They
little
think
what
service
they
have
do
us
,
and
how
unwittingly
,
and
by
the
great
ignorance
,
they
have
make
themselves
pilot
to
us
,
while
we
,
have
not
sound
the
place
,
may
have
be
lose
before
we
be
aware
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
we
may
have
sound
our
new
harbour
before
we
have
venture
out
,
but
I
can
not
say
for
certain
whether
we
should
or
not
;
for
I
,
for
my
part
,
have
not
the
least
suspicion
of
what
our
real
case
be
;
however
,
I
say
,
perhaps
,
before
we
have
weigh
,
we
should
have
look
about
us
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
we
ought
to
have
do
it
;
for
,
besides
these
army
of
human
fury
,
we
have
a
very
leaky
ship
,
and
all
our
pump
could
hardly
keep
the
water
from
grow
upon
us
,
and
our
carpenter
be
overboard
,
work
to
find
out
and
stop
the
wound
we
have
receive
,
heel
her
first
on
the
one
side
,
and
then
on
the
other
;
and
it
be
very
divert
to
see
how
,
when
our
man
heel
the
ship
over
to
the
side
next
the
wild
army
that
stand
on
the
east
horn
of
the
sand
,
they
be
so
amazed
,
between
fright
and
joy
,
that
it
put
them
into
a
kind
of
confusion
,
call
to
one
another
,
halloo
and
skreeke
,
in
a
manner
that
it
be
impossible
to
describe
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
do
this
,
for
we
be
in
a
great
hurry
<EOS>
you
may
be
sure
,
and
all
hand
at
work
,
as
well
at
the
stop
our
leak
as
repair
our
rigging
and
sail
,
which
have
receive
a
great
deal
of
damage
,
and
also
in
rig
a
new
main
-
top
-
mast
and
the
like
;
 
I
say
,
while
we
be
do
all
this
,
we
perceive
a
body
of
man
,
of
near
a
thousand
,
move
from
that
part
of
the
army
of
the
barbarian
that
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
sandy
bay
,
and
come
all
along
the
water
's
edge
,
round
the
sand
,
till
they
stand
just
on
our
broadside
east
,
and
be
within
about
half
-
a
-
mile
of
us
.
<EOS>
then
we
see
the
dutchman
come
forward
nearer
to
us
,
and
all
alone
,
with
his
white
flag
and
all
his
motion
,
just
as
before
,
and
there
he
stand
.
  
<EOS>
Our
man
have
but
just
bring
the
ship
to
right
again
as
they
come
up
to
our
broadside
,
and
we
have
very
happily
find
out
and
stop
the
bad
and
most
dangerous
leak
that
we
have
,
to
our
very
great
satisfaction
;
so
I
order
the
boat
to
be
haul
up
and
man
as
they
be
the
day
before
,
and
William
to
go
as
plenipotentiary
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
go
myself
if
I
have
understand
Dutch
,
but
as
I
do
not
,
it
be
to
no
purpose
,
for
I
should
be
able
to
know
nothing
of
what
be
say
but
from
him
at
second
-
hand
,
which
may
be
do
as
well
afterwards
.
<EOS>
all
the
instruction
I
pretend
to
give
William
be
,
if
possible
,
to
get
the
old
Dutchman
away
,
and
,
if
he
could
,
to
make
him
come
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
William
go
just
as
before
,
and
when
he
come
within
about
sixty
or
seventy
yard
of
the
shore
,
he
hold
up
his
white
flag
as
the
Dutchman
do
,
and
turn
the
boat
's
broadside
to
the
shore
,
and
his
man
lie
upon
their
oar
,
the
parley
or
dialogue
begin
again
thus
:
    
William
.
<EOS>
well
,
friend
,
what
dost
thou
say
to
us
now
?
  
<EOS>
Dutchman
.
<EOS>
I
come
of
the
same
mild
errand
as
I
do
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
W.
what
!
<EOS>
dost
thou
pretend
to
come
of
a
mild
errand
with
all
these
people
at
thy
back
,
and
all
the
foolish
weapon
of
war
they
bring
with
them
?
<EOS>
Prithee
,
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
mean
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
the
king
hasten
us
to
invite
the
captain
and
all
his
man
to
come
on
shore
,
and
have
order
all
his
man
to
show
them
all
the
civility
they
can
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Well
,
and
be
all
those
man
come
to
invite
us
ashore
?
  
<EOS>
D.
They
will
do
you
no
hurt
,
if
you
will
come
on
shore
peaceably
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Well
,
and
what
dost
thou
think
they
can
do
to
us
,
if
we
will
not
?
  
<EOS>
D.
I
would
not
have
them
do
you
any
hurt
then
,
neither
.
  
<EOS>
W.
but
prithee
,
friend
,
do
not
make
thyself
fool
and
knave
too
.
<EOS>
dost
not
<EOS>
thou
know
that
we
be
out
of
fear
of
all
thy
army
,
and
out
of
danger
of
all
that
they
can
do
?
<EOS>
what
make
thee
act
so
simply
as
well
as
so
knavishly
?
  
<EOS>
D.
why
,
you
may
think
yourself
safe
than
you
be
;
you
do
not
know
what
they
may
do
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
they
be
able
to
do
you
a
great
deal
of
harm
,
and
perhaps
burn
your
ship
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Suppose
that
be
true
,
as
I
be
sure
it
be
false
<EOS>
;
you
see
we
have
more
ship
to
carry
us
off
(
point
to
the
sloop
)
.
  
<EOS>
[
N.B.
 
just
at
this
time
we
discover
the
sloop
stand
towards
us
from
the
east
,
along
the
shore
,
at
about
the
distance
of
two
league
,
which
be
to
our
particular
satisfaction
,
she
have
be
miss
thirteen
day
.
]
  
<EOS>
D.
We
do
not
value
that
;
if
you
have
ten
ship
,
you
dare
not
come
on
shore
,
with
all
the
man
you
have
,
in
a
hostile
way
;
we
be
too
many
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Thou
dost
not
,
even
in
that
,
speak
as
thou
mean
;
and
we
may
give
thee
a
trial
of
our
hand
when
our
friend
come
up
to
us
,
for
thou
hear
<EOS>
they
have
discover
us
.
  
<EOS>
[
just
then
the
sloop
fire
five
gun
,
which
be
to
get
news
of
us
,
for
they
do
not
see
us
.
]
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
hear
they
fire
;
but
I
hope
your
ship
will
not
fire
again
;
for
,
if
they
do
,
our
general
will
take
it
for
break
the
truce
,
and
will
make
the
army
let
fly
a
shower
of
arrow
at
you
in
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Thou
mayest
be
sure
the
ship
will
fire
that
the
other
ship
may
hear
them
,
but
not
with
ball
.
<EOS>
if
thy
general
know
no
better
,
he
may
begin
when
he
will
;
but
thou
mayest
be
sure
we
will
return
it
to
his
cost
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
what
must
I
do
,
then
?
  
<EOS>
W.
Do
!
<EOS>
why
,
go
to
him
,
and
tell
him
of
it
beforehand
,
then
;
and
let
him
know
that
the
ship
firing
be
not
at
him
nor
his
man
;
and
then
come
again
,
and
tell
us
what
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
D.
no
<EOS>
;
I
will
send
to
him
,
which
will
do
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Do
as
thou
wilt
,
but
I
believe
thou
hadst
better
go
thyself
;
for
if
our
man
fire
first
,
I
suppose
he
will
be
in
a
great
wrath
,
and
it
may
be
at
thee
;
for
,
as
to
his
wrath
at
us
,
we
tell
thee
<EOS>
beforehand
we
value
it
not
.
  
<EOS>
D.
You
slight
them
too
much
;
you
know
not
what
they
may
do
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Thou
makest
as
if
these
poor
savage
wretch
could
do
mighty
thing
<EOS>
:
prithee
,
let
us
see
what
you
can
all
do
,
we
value
it
not
;
thou
mayest
set
down
thy
flag
of
truce
when
thou
pleasest
,
and
begin
.
  
<EOS>
D.
I
have
rather
make
a
truce
,
and
have
you
all
part
friend
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Thou
art
a
deceitful
rogue
thyself
,
for
it
be
plain
thou
knowest
<EOS>
these
people
would
only
persuade
us
on
shore
to
entrap
and
surprise
us
;
and
yet
thou
that
art
a
Christian
,
as
thou
callest
thyself
,
would
have
us
come
on
shore
and
put
our
life
into
their
hand
who
know
nothing
that
belong
to
compassion
,
good
usage
,
or
good
manner
.
<EOS>
how
canst
thou
be
such
a
villain
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
how
can
you
call
me
so
?
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
to
you
,
and
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
  
<EOS>
W.
not
act
like
a
traitor
,
but
like
one
that
be
once
a
Christian
,
and
would
have
be
so
still
,
if
you
have
not
be
a
dutchman
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
do
,
not
I.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
from
them
;
they
be
a
bloody
people
.
  
<EOS>
W.
Prithee
,
make
no
difficulty
of
what
thou
shouldst
do
.
<EOS>
Canst
thou
swim
?
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
can
swim
;
but
if
I
should
attempt
to
swim
off
to
you
,
I
should
have
a
thousand
arrow
and
javelin
stick
in
me
before
I
should
get
to
your
boat
.
  
<EOS>
W.
I
will
bring
the
boat
close
to
thee
,
and
take
thee
on
board
in
spite
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
We
will
give
them
but
one
volley
,
and
I
will
engage
they
will
all
run
away
from
thee
.
  
<EOS>
D.
<EOS>
You
be
mistaken
in
them
,
I
assure
you
;
they
would
immediately
come
all
run
down
to
the
shore
,
and
shoot
fire
-
arrow
at
you
,
and
set
your
boat
and
ship
and
all
on
fire
about
your
ear
.
  
<EOS>
W.
We
will
venture
that
if
thou
wilt
come
off
.
  
<EOS>
D.
Will
you
use
me
honourably
when
I
be
among
you
?
  
<EOS>
W.
I
will
give
thee
my
word
for
it
,
if
thou
provest
honest
.
  
<EOS>
D.
Will
you
not
make
me
a
prisoner
?
  
<EOS>
W.
I
will
be
thy
surety
,
body
for
body
,
that
thou
shalt
be
a
free
man
,
and
go
whither
thou
wilt
,
though
I
own
to
thee
thou
dost
not
deserve
it
.
  
<EOS>
just
at
this
time
our
ship
fire
three
gun
to
answer
the
sloop
and
let
her
know
we
see
her
,
who
immediately
,
we
perceive
,
understand
it
,
and
stand
directly
for
the
place
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
express
the
confusion
and
filthy
vile
noise
,
the
hurry
and
universal
disorder
,
that
be
among
that
vast
multitude
of
people
upon
our
firing
off
three
gun
.
<EOS>
They
immediately
all
repair
to
their
arm
,
as
I
may
call
it
;
for
to
say
they
put
themselves
into
order
would
be
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
word
of
command
,
then
,
they
advance
all
in
a
body
to
the
seaside
,
and
resolve
to
give
us
one
volley
of
their
fire
-
arm
(
for
such
they
be
)
,
immediately
they
salute
us
with
a
hundred
thousand
of
their
fire
-
arrow
,
every
one
carry
a
little
bag
of
cloth
dip
in
brimstone
,
or
some
such
thing
,
which
,
fly
through
the
air
,
have
nothing
to
hinder
it
take
fire
as
it
fly
,
and
it
generally
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
<EOS>
but
this
method
of
attack
us
,
by
a
way
we
have
no
notion
of
,
may
give
us
at
first
some
little
surprise
,
for
the
number
be
so
great
at
first
,
that
we
be
not
altogether
without
apprehension
that
they
may
unluckily
set
our
ship
on
fire
,
so
that
William
resolve
immediately
to
row
on
board
,
and
persuade
us
all
to
weigh
and
stand
out
to
sea
;
but
there
be
no
time
for
it
,
for
they
immediately
let
fly
a
volley
at
the
boat
,
and
at
the
ship
,
from
all
part
of
the
vast
crowd
of
people
which
stand
near
the
shore
.
<EOS>
nor
do
they
fire
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
all
at
once
,
and
so
leave
off
;
but
their
arrow
be
soon
notch
upon
their
bow
,
they
keep
continually
shoot
,
so
that
the
air
be
full
of
flame
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
say
whether
they
set
their
cotton
rag
on
fire
before
they
shoot
the
arrow
,
for
I
do
not
perceive
they
have
fire
with
them
,
which
,
however
,
it
seem
they
have
.
<EOS>
the
arrow
,
besides
the
fire
it
carry
with
it
,
have
a
head
,
or
a
peg
,
as
we
call
it
,
of
bone
;
and
some
of
sharp
flint
stone
;
and
some
few
of
a
metal
,
too
soft
in
itself
for
metal
,
but
hard
enough
to
cause
it
to
enter
,
if
it
be
a
plank
,
so
as
to
stick
where
it
fall
.
  
<EOS>
William
and
his
man
have
notice
sufficient
to
lie
close
behind
their
waste
-
board
,
which
,
for
this
very
purpose
,
they
have
make
so
high
that
they
could
easily
sink
themselves
behind
them
,
so
as
to
defend
themselves
from
anything
that
come
point
-
blank
(
<EOS>
as
we
call
it
)
or
upon
a
line
;
but
for
what
may
fall
perpendicularly
out
of
the
air
they
have
no
guard
,
but
take
the
hazard
of
that
.
<EOS>
at
first
they
make
as
if
they
would
row
away
,
but
before
they
go
they
give
a
volley
of
their
fire
-
arm
,
fire
at
those
which
stand
with
the
Dutchman
;
but
William
order
them
to
be
sure
to
take
their
aim
at
other
,
so
as
to
miss
him
,
and
they
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
calling
to
them
now
,
for
the
noise
be
so
great
among
them
that
they
could
hear
nobody
,
but
our
man
boldly
row
in
nearer
to
them
,
for
they
be
at
first
drive
a
little
off
,
and
when
they
come
nearer
,
they
fire
a
second
volley
,
which
put
the
fellow
into
great
confusion
,
and
we
could
see
from
the
ship
that
several
of
them
be
kill
or
wound
.
  
<EOS>
We
think
this
be
a
very
unequal
fight
,
and
therefore
we
make
a
signal
to
our
man
to
row
away
,
that
we
may
have
a
little
of
the
sport
as
well
as
they
;
but
the
arrow
fly
so
thick
upon
them
,
be
so
near
the
shore
,
that
they
could
not
sit
to
their
oar
,
so
they
spread
a
little
of
their
sail
,
think
they
may
sail
along
the
shore
,
and
lie
behind
their
waste
-
board
;
but
the
sail
have
not
be
spread
six
minute
till
it
have
five
hundred
fire
-
arrow
shoot
into
it
and
through
it
,
and
at
length
set
it
fairly
on
fire
;
nor
be
our
man
quite
out
of
the
danger
of
its
set
the
boat
on
fire
,
and
this
make
them
paddle
and
shove
the
boat
away
as
well
as
they
could
,
as
they
lay
,
to
get
farth
off
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
have
leave
us
a
fair
mark
at
the
whole
savage
army
;
and
as
we
have
sheer
the
ship
as
near
to
them
as
we
could
,
we
fire
among
the
thick
of
them
six
or
seven
time
,
five
gun
at
a
time
,
with
shot
,
old
iron
,
musket
-
bullet
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
We
could
easily
see
that
we
make
havoc
among
them
,
and
kill
and
wound
abundance
of
them
,
and
that
they
be
in
a
great
surprise
at
it
;
but
yet
they
never
offer
to
stir
,
and
all
this
while
their
fire
-
arrow
fly
as
thick
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
on
a
sudden
their
arrow
stop
,
and
the
old
Dutchman
come
run
down
to
the
water
-
side
all
alone
,
with
his
white
flag
,
as
before
,
wave
it
as
high
as
he
could
,
and
make
signal
to
our
boat
to
come
to
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
William
do
not
care
at
first
to
go
near
him
,
but
the
man
continue
to
make
signal
to
him
to
come
,
at
last
William
go
;
and
the
Dutchman
tell
him
that
he
have
be
with
the
general
,
who
be
much
mollify
by
the
slaughter
of
his
man
,
and
that
now
he
could
have
anything
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
anything
!
"
say
William
;
"
what
have
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
let
him
go
about
his
business
,
and
carry
his
man
out
of
gunshot
,
can
not
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
the
Dutchman
,
"
but
he
dare
not
stir
,
nor
see
the
king
's
face
;
unless
some
of
your
man
come
on
shore
,
he
will
certainly
put
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
William
,
"
he
be
a
dead
man
;
for
if
it
be
to
save
his
life
,
and
the
life
of
all
the
crowd
that
be
with
him
,
he
shall
never
have
one
of
us
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
thee
,
"
say
William
,
"
how
thou
shalt
cheat
him
,
and
gain
thy
own
liberty
too
,
if
thou
hast
any
mind
to
see
thy
own
country
again
,
and
art
not
turn
savage
,
and
grow
fond
of
live
all
thy
day
among
heathen
and
savage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
be
glad
to
do
it
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
if
I
should
offer
to
swim
off
to
you
now
,
though
they
be
so
far
from
me
,
they
shoot
so
true
that
they
would
kill
me
before
I
get
half
-
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
will
tell
thee
how
thou
shalt
come
with
his
consent
.
<EOS>
go
to
him
,
and
tell
him
I
have
offer
to
carry
you
on
board
,
to
try
if
you
could
persuade
the
captain
to
come
on
shore
,
and
that
I
would
not
hinder
him
if
he
be
willing
to
venture
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
dutchman
seem
in
a
rapture
at
the
very
first
word
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
be
persuade
he
will
give
me
leave
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
away
he
run
,
as
if
he
have
a
glad
message
to
carry
,
and
tell
the
general
that
William
have
promise
,
if
he
would
go
on
board
the
ship
with
him
,
he
would
persuade
the
captain
to
return
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
general
be
fool
enough
to
give
him
order
to
go
,
and
charge
him
not
to
come
back
without
the
captain
;
which
he
readily
promise
,
and
very
honestly
may
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
take
him
in
,
and
bring
him
on
board
,
and
he
be
as
good
as
his
word
to
them
,
for
he
never
go
back
to
them
any
more
;
and
the
sloop
be
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
inlet
where
we
lay
,
we
weigh
and
set
sail
;
but
,
as
we
go
out
,
be
pretty
near
the
shore
,
we
fire
three
gun
,
as
it
be
among
them
,
but
without
any
shot
,
for
it
be
of
no
use
to
us
to
hurt
any
more
of
them
.
<EOS>
after
we
have
fire
,
we
give
them
a
cheer
,
as
the
seaman
call
it
<EOS>
;
that
be
to
say
,
we
halloo
,
at
them
,
by
way
of
triumph
,
and
so
carry
off
their
ambassador
.
<EOS>
how
it
fare
with
their
general
,
we
know
nothing
of
that
.
  
<EOS>
this
passage
,
when
I
relate
it
to
a
friend
of
mine
,
after
my
return
from
those
ramble
,
agree
so
well
with
his
relation
of
what
happen
to
one
Mr
Knox
,
an
english
captain
,
who
some
time
ago
be
decoy
on
shore
by
these
people
,
that
it
could
not
but
be
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
to
think
what
mischief
we
have
all
escape
;
and
I
think
it
can
not
but
be
very
profitable
to
record
the
other
story
(
which
be
but
short
)
with
my
own
,
to
show
whoever
read
this
what
it
be
I
avoid
,
and
prevent
their
falling
into
the
like
,
if
they
have
to
do
with
the
perfidious
people
of
Ceylon
.
<EOS>
the
relation
be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
the
island
of
Ceylon
be
inhabit
for
the
great
part
by
barbarian
,
which
will
not
allow
any
trade
or
commerce
with
any
european
nation
,
and
inaccessible
by
any
traveller
,
it
will
be
convenient
to
relate
the
occasion
how
the
author
of
this
story
happen
to
go
into
this
island
,
and
what
opportunity
he
have
of
be
fully
acquaint
with
the
people
,
their
law
and
custom
,
that
so
we
may
the
well
depend
upon
the
account
,
and
value
it
as
it
deserve
,
for
the
rarity
as
well
as
the
truth
of
it
;
and
both
these
the
author
give
us
a
brief
relation
of
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
His
word
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
in
the
year
1657
,
the
Anne
frigate
,
of
London
,
Captain
Robert
Knox
,
commander
,
on
the
21st
day
of
January
,
set
sail
out
of
the
down
,
in
the
service
of
the
honourable
East
India
Company
of
England
,
bind
for
Fort
St
George
,
upon
the
coast
of
Coromandel
,
to
trade
for
one
year
from
port
to
port
in
India
;
which
have
perform
,
as
he
be
lade
his
good
to
return
for
England
,
be
in
the
road
of
Masulipatam
,
on
the
19th
of
November
1659
,
there
happen
such
a
mighty
storm
,
that
in
it
several
ship
be
cast
away
,
and
he
be
force
to
cut
his
mainmast
by
the
board
,
which
so
disable
the
ship
,
that
he
could
not
proceed
in
his
voyage
;
whereupon
Cottiar
,
in
the
island
of
Ceylon
,
be
a
very
commodious
bay
,
fit
for
her
present
distress
,
Thomas
Chambers
,
Esq
.
,
since
Sir
Thomas
Chambers
,
the
agent
at
Fort
St
George
,
order
that
the
ship
should
take
in
some
cloth
and
India
merchant
belong
to
Porto
Novo
,
who
may
trade
there
while
she
lie
to
set
her
mast
,
and
repair
the
other
damage
sustain
by
the
storm
.
<EOS>
at
her
first
come
thither
,
after
the
indian
merchant
be
set
ashore
,
the
captain
and
his
man
be
very
jealous
of
the
people
of
that
place
,
by
reason
the
English
never
have
any
commerce
or
deal
with
them
;
but
after
they
have
be
there
twenty
day
,
go
ashore
and
return
again
at
pleasure
,
without
any
molestation
,
they
begin
to
lay
aside
all
suspicious
thought
of
the
people
that
dwelt
thereabout
,
who
have
kindly
entertain
them
for
their
money
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
king
of
the
country
have
notice
of
their
arrival
,
and
,
not
be
acquaint
with
their
intent
,
he
send
down
a
dissauva
,
or
general
,
with
an
army
,
to
them
,
who
immediately
send
a
messenger
to
the
captain
on
board
,
to
desire
him
to
come
ashore
to
him
,
pretend
a
letter
from
the
king
.
<EOS>
the
captain
salute
the
message
with
firing
of
gun
,
and
order
his
son
,
Robert
Knox
,
and
Mr
John
Loveland
,
merchant
of
the
ship
,
to
go
ashore
,
and
wait
on
him
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
come
before
him
,
he
demand
who
they
be
,
and
how
long
they
should
stay
.
<EOS>
They
tell
him
they
be
Englishmen
,
and
not
to
stay
above
twenty
or
thirty
day
,
and
desire
permission
to
trade
in
his
Majesty
's
port
.
<EOS>
His
answer
be
,
that
the
king
be
glad
to
hear
the
English
be
come
into
his
country
,
and
have
command
him
to
assist
them
as
they
should
desire
,
and
have
send
a
letter
to
be
deliver
to
none
but
the
captain
himself
.
<EOS>
They
be
then
twelve
mile
from
the
seaside
,
and
therefore
reply
,
that
the
captain
could
not
leave
his
ship
to
come
so
far
;
but
if
he
please
to
go
down
to
the
seaside
,
the
captain
would
wait
on
him
to
receive
the
letter
;
whereupon
the
dissauva
desire
them
to
stay
that
day
,
and
on
the
morrow
he
would
go
with
them
;
which
,
rather
than
displease
him
in
so
small
a
matter
,
they
consent
to
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
the
dissauva
send
a
present
to
the
captain
of
cattle
and
fruit
,
&
c.
,
which
,
be
carry
all

by
the
messenger
,
be
deliver
to
him
in
the
morning
,
who
tell
him
withal
that
his
man
be
come
down
with
the
dissauva
,
and
desire
his
company
on
shore
against
his
coming
,
have
a
letter
from
the
king
to
deliver
into
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
mistrust
nothing
,
come
on
shore
with
his
boat
,
and
,
sit
under
a
tamarind
tree
,
wait
for
the
dissauva
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
native
soldier
privately
surround
him
and
the
seven
man
he
have
with
him
,
and
seize
them
,
carry
them
to
meet
the
dissauva
,
bear
the
captain
on
a
hammock
on
their
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
the
long
-
boat
's
crew
,
not
know
what
have
happen
,
come
on
shore
to
cut
down
a
tree
to
make
cheek
for
the
mainmast
,
and
be
make
prisoner
after
the
same
manner
,
though
with
more
violence
,
because
they
be
more
rough
with
them
,
and
make
resistance
;
yet
they
be
not
bring
to
the
captain
and
his
company
,
but
quarter
in
another
house
in
the
same
town
.
  
<EOS>
the
dissauva
have
thus
get
two
boat
and
eighteen
man
,
his
next
care
be
to
gain
the
ship
;
and
to
that
end
,
tell
the
captain
that
he
and
his
man
be
only

because
the
king
intend
to
send
letter
and
a
present

the
english
nation
by
him
,
desire
he
would
send
some
man
on
board
his
ship
to
order
her
to
stay
;
and
because
the
ship
be
in
danger
of
be
fire
by
the
Dutch
if
she
stay
long
in
the
bay
,
to
bring
her
up
the
river
.
<EOS>
the
captain
do
not
approve
of
the
advice
,
but
do
not
dare
to
own
his
dislike
;
so
he
send
his
son
with
the
order
,
but
with
a
solemn
conjuration
to
return
again
,
which
he
accordingly
do
,
bring
a
letter
from
the
company
in
the
ship
,
that
they
would
not
obey
the
captain
,
nor

other

in
this
matter
,
but

to
stand
on
their
own
defence
.
<EOS>

letter

the
dissauva

who
thereupon
give
the
captain
leave
to
write
for
what
he
would
have
bring
from
the
ship
,
pretend
that
he
have
not

king
's
order
to
release
them
,
though
it
would
suddenly
come
.
  
<EOS>

part

which

<EOS>
the
captain
and
his
son
after
some
time
be
visit
with
the
common
distemper

and
the
captain

with
grief
for
his
deplorable
condition

than

month

<EOS>
Robert
Knox
,
his
son
,
be
now
leave
desolate
,
sick
,
and
in
captivity
,
have
none
to
comfort
him
<EOS>
but
God
,
who
be
the
Father
of
the
fatherless
,
and
hear
the
groan
of
such
as
be
in
captivity
;
be
alone
to
enter
upon
a
long
scene
of
misery
and
calamity
;
oppress
with
weakness
of
body
and
grief
of
soul
for
the
loss
of
his
father
,
and
the
remediless
trouble
that
he
be
like
to
endure
;
and
the
first
instance
of
it
be
in
the
burial
of
his
father
,
for
he
send
his
black
boy
to
the
people
of
the
town
,
to
desire
their
assistance
,
because
they
understand
not
their
language
;
but
they
send
him
only
a
rope
,
to
drag
him
by
the
neck
into
the
wood
,
and
tell
him
that
they
would
offer
him
no
other
help
,
unless
he
would
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
this
barbarous
answer
increase
his
trouble
for
his
father
's
death
,
that
now
he
be
like
to
lie
unburied
,
and
be
make
a
prey
to
the
wild
beast
in
the
wood
;
for
the
ground
be
very
hard
,
and
they
have
not
tool
to
dig
with
,
and
so
it
be
impossible
for
them
to
bury
him
;
and
have
a
small
matter
of
money
leave
him
,
viz
.
,
<EOS>
a
pagoda
and
a
gold
ring
<EOS>
,
he
hire
a
man
,
and
so
bury
him
in
as
decent
a
manner
as
their
condition
would
permit
.
  
<EOS>
His
dead
father
be
thus
remove
out
of
his
sight
,
but
his
ague
continue
,
he
be
reduce
very
low
,
partly
by
sorrow
and
partly
by
his
disease
.
<EOS>
all
the
comfort
he
have
be
to
go
into
the
wood
and
field
with
a
book
,
either
the
"
practice
of
Piety
"
or
Mr
Rogers
's
"
Seven
Treatises
,
"
which
be
the
only
two
book
he
have
,
and
meditate
and
read
,
and
sometimes
pray
;
in
which
his
anguish
make
him
often
invert
Elijah
's
petition
,
 
that
he
may
die
,
because
his
life
be
a
burden
to
him
.
<EOS>
God
,
though
He
be
pleased
to
prolong
his
life
,
yet
He
find
a
way
to
lighten
his
grief
,
by
remove
his
ague
,
and
grant
him
a
desire
which
above
all
thing
be
acceptable
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
read
his
two
book
over
so
often
that
he
have
both
almost
by
heart
;
and
though
they
be
both
pious
and
good
writing
,
yet
he
long
for
the
truth
from
the
original
fountain
,
and
think
it
his
great
unhappiness
that
he
have
not
a
Bible
,
and
do
believe
that
he
should
never
see
one
again
;
but
,
contrary
to
his
expectation
,
God
bring
him
one
after
this
manner
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
fish
one
day
with
his
black
boy
,
to
catch
some
fish
to
relieve
his
hunger
,
an
old
man
pass
by
them
,
and
ask
his
boy
whether
his
master
could
read
;
and
when
the
boy
have
answer
yes
,
he
tell
him
that
he
have
get
a
book
from
the
Portuguese
,
when
they
leave
Colombo
;
and
,
if
his
master
please
,
he
would
sell
it
him
.
<EOS>
the
boy
tell
his
master
,
who
bid
him
go
and
see
what
book
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
boy
have
serve
the
English
some
time
,
know
the
book
,
and
as
soon
as
he
get
it
into
his
hand
,
come
run
to
him
,
call
out
before
he
come
to
him
,
"
It
be
the
Bible
!
"
<EOS>
the
word
startle
him
,
and
he
fling
down
his
angle
to
meet
him
,
and
,
find
it
be
true
,
be
mightily
rejoice
to
see
it
;
but
he
be
afraid
he
should
not
have
enough
to
purchase
it
,
though
he
be
resolve
to
part
with
all
the
money
he
have
,
which
be
but
one
pagoda
,
to
buy
it
;
but
his
black
boy
persuade
him
to
slight
it
,
and
leave
it
to
him
to
buy
it
,
he
at
length
obtain
it
for
a
knit
cap
.
  
<EOS>
this
accident
he
could
not
but
look
upon
as
a
great
miracle
,
that
God
should
bestow
upon
him
such
an
extraordinary
blessing
,
and
bring
him
a
Bible
in
his
own
native
language
,
in
such
a
remote
part
of
the
world
,
where
His
name
be
not
know
,
and
where
it
be
never
hear
of
that
an
Englishman
have
ever
be
before
.
<EOS>
the
enjoyment
of
this
mercy
be
a
great
comfort
to
him
in
captivity
,
and
though
he
want
no
bodily
convenience
that
the
country
do
afford
;
for
the
king
,
immediately
after
his
father
's
death
,
have
send
an
express
order
to
the
people
of
the
town
,
that
they
should
be
kind
to
him
,
and
give
him
good
victual
;
and
after
he
have
be
some
time
in
the
country
,
and
understand
the
language
,
he
get
him
good
convenience
,
as
a
house
and
garden
;
and
fall
to
husbandry
,
God
so
prosper
him
,
that
he
have
plenty
,
not
only
for
himself
,
but
to
lend
other
;
which
be
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
country
,
at
50
per
cent
.
<EOS>
a
year
,
much
enrich
him
:
he
have
also
goat
,
which
serve
him
for
mutton
,
and
hog
and
hen
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
,
I
say
,
for
he
live
as
fine
as
any
of
their
nobleman
,
he
could
not
so
far
forget
his
native
country
as
to
be
content
to
dwell
in
a
strange
land
,
where
there
be
to
him
a
famine
of
God
's
word
and
sacrament
,
the
want
of
which
make
all
other
thing
to
be
of
little
value
to
him
;
therefore
,
as
he
make
it
his
daily
and
fervent
prayer
to
God
,
in
His
good
time
,
to
restore
him
to
both
,
so
,
at
length
,
he
,
with
one
Stephen
Rutland
,
who
have
live
with
him
two
year
before
,
resolve
to
make
their
escape
,
and
,
about
the
year
1673
,
meditate
all
secret
way
to
compass
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
before
take
up
a
way
of
peddle
about
the
country
,
and
buy
tobacco
,
pepper
,
garlic
,
comb
,
and
all
sort
of
iron
ware
,
and
carry
them
into
those
part
of
the
country
where
they
want
them
;
and
now
,
to
promote
their
design
,
as
they
go
with
their
commodity
from
place
to
place
,
they
discourse
with
the
country
people
<EOS>
(
for
they
could
now
speak
their
language
well
)
concern
the
way
and
inhabitant
,
where
the
isle
be
thin
and
fullest
inhabit
,
where
and
how
the
watch
lie
from
one
country
to
another
,
and
what
commodity
be
proper
for
them
to
carry
into
all
part
;
pretend
that
they
would
furnish
themselves
with
such
ware
as
the
respective
place
want
.
<EOS>
none
doubt
but
what
they
do
be
upon
the
account
of
trade
,
because
Mr
Knox
be
so
well
seated
,
and
could
not
be
suppose
to
leave
such
an
estate
,
by
travel
northward
,
because
that
part
of
the
land
be
least
inhabit
;
and
so
,
furnish
themselves
with
such
ware
as
be
vendible
in
those
part
,
they
set
forth
,
and
steer
their
course
towards
the
north
part
of
the
island
,
know
very
little
of
the
way
,
which
be
generally
intricate
and
perplex
,
because
they
have
no
public
road
,
but
a
multitude
of
little
path
from
one
town
to
another
,
and
those
often
change
;
and
for
white
man
to
inquire
about
the
way
be
very
dangerous
,
because
the
people
would
presently
suspect
their
design
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
they
travel
from
Conde
Uda
as
far
as
the
country
of
Nuwarakalawiya
,
which
be
the
furthermost
part
of
the
king
's
dominion
,
and
about
three
day
'
journey
from
their
dwelling
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
thankful
to
Providence
that
they
have
pass
all
difficulty
so
far
,
but
yet
they
durst
not
go
any
farther
,
because
they
have
no
ware
leave
to
traffic
with
;
and
it
be
the
first
time
they
have
be
absent
so
long
from
home
<EOS>
,
they
fear
the
townsman
would
come
after
them
to
seek
for
them
;
and
so
they
return
home
,
and
go
eight
or
ten
time
into
those
part
with
their
ware
,
till
they
become
well
acquaint
both
with
the
people
and
the
path
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
part
Mr
Knox
meet
his
black
boy
,
whom
he
have
turn
away
diver
year
before
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
get
a
wife
and
child
,
and
be
very
poor
;
but
be
acquaint
with
these
quarter
,
he
not
only
take
direction
of
him
,
but
agree
with
him
,
for
a
good
reward
,
to
conduct
him
and
his
companion
to
the
Dutch
.
<EOS>
He
gladly
undertake
it
,
and
a
time
be
appoint
between
them
;
but
Mr
Knox
be
disable
by
a
grievous
pain
,
which
seize
him
on
his
right
side
,
and
hold
him
five
day
that
he
could
not
travel
,
this
appointment
prove
in
vain
;
for
though
he
go
as
soon
as
he
be
well
,
his
guide
be
go
into
another
country
about
his
business
,
and
they
durst
not
at
that
time
venture
to
run
away
without
him
.
  
<EOS>
these
attempt
take
up
eight
or
nine
year
,
various
accident
hinder
their
design
,
but
most
commonly
the
dry
weather
,
because
they
fear
in
the
wood
they
should
be
starve
with
thirst
,
all
the
country
be
in
such
a
condition
almost
four
or
five
year
together
for
lack
of
rain
.
  
<EOS>
on
September
22
,
1679
,
they
set
forth
again
,
furnish
with
knife
and
small
axis
for
their
defence
,
because
they
could
carry
them
privately
and
send
all
sort
of
ware
to
sell
as
formerly
,
and
all
necessary
provision
,
the
moon
be
twenty
-
seven
day
old
,
that
they
may
have
light
to
run
away
by
,
to
try
what
success
God
Almighty
would
now
give
them
in
seek
their
liberty
.
<EOS>
Their
first
stage
be
to
Anuradhapoora
,
in
the
way
to
which
lie
a
wilderness
,
call
Parraoth
Mocolane
,
full
of
wild
elephant
,
tiger
,
and
bear
;
and
because
it
be
the
utmost
confine
of
the
king
's
dominion
,
there
be
always
a
watch
keep
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
way
they
hear
that
the
governor
's
officer
of
these
part
be
out
to
gather
up
the
king
's
revenue
and
duty
,
to
send
them
up
to
the
city
;
which
put
them
into
no
small
fear
,
l
,
find
them
,
they
should
send
them
back
again
;
whereupon
they
withdraw
to
the
western
part
of
Ecpoulpot
,
and
sit
down
to
knit
till
they
hear
the
officer
be
go
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
depart
,
they
go
onwards
of
their
journey
,
have
get
a
good
parcel
of
cotton
-
yarn
to
knit
cap
with
,
and
have
keep
their
ware
,
as
they
pretend
,
to
exchange
for
dry
flesh
,
which
be
sell
only
in
those
low
part
.
<EOS>
Their
way
lie
necessarily
through
the
governor
's
yard
at
Kalluvilla
,
who
dwell
there
on
purpose
to
examine
all
that
go
and
come
.
<EOS>
this
greatly
distress
them
,
because
he
would
easily
suspect
they
be
out
of
their
bound
,
be
captive
;
however
,
they
go
resolutely
to
his
house
,
and
meet
him
,
present
him
with
a
small
parcel
of
tobacco
and
betel
;
and
,
show
him
their
ware
,
tell
him
they
come
to
get
dry
flesh
to
carry
back
with
them
.
<EOS>
the
governor
do
not
suspect
them
,
but
tell
them
he
be
sorry
they
come
in
so
dry
a
time
,
when
no
deer
be
to
be
catch
,
but
if
some
rain
fall
,
he
would
soon
supply
them
.
<EOS>
this
answer
please
them
,
and
they
seem
contented
to
stay
;
and
accordingly
,
abide
with
him
two
or
three
day
,
and
no
rain
fall
,
they
present
the
governor
with
five
or
six
charge
of
gunpowder
,
which
be
a
rarity
among
them
;
and
leave
a
bundle
at
his
house
,
they
desire
him
to
shoot
them
some
deer
,
while
they
make
a
step
to
Anuradhapoora
.
<EOS>
here
also
they
be
put
in
a
great
fright
by
the
coming
of
certain
soldier
from
the
king
to
the
governor
,
to
give
him
order
to
set
a
secure
guard
at
the
watch
,
that
no
suspicious
person
may
pass
,
which
,
though
it
be
only
intend
to
prevent
the
flight
of
the
relation
of
certain
noble
whom
the
king
have
clap
up
,
yet
they
fear
they
may
wonder
to
see
white
man
here
,
and
so
send
them
back
again
;
but
God
so
order
it
that
they
be
very
kind
to
them
and
leave
them
to
their
business
,
and
so
they
get
safe
to
Anuradhapoora
.
<EOS>
Their
pretence
be
dry
flesh
,
though
they
know
there
be
none
to
be
have
;
but
their
real
business
be
to
search
the
way
down
to
the
Dutch
,
which
they
stay
three
day
to
do
;
but
<EOS>
find
that
in
the
way
to
Jaffnapatam
,
which
be
one
of
the
dutch
port
,
there
be
a
watch
which
could
hardly
be
pass
,
and
other
inconvenience
not
surmountable
,
they
resolve
to
go
back
,
and
take
the
river
Malwatta
Oya
,
which
they
have
before
judge
would
be
a
probable
guide
to
lead
them
to
the
sea
;
and
,
that
they
may
not
be
pursue
,
leave
Anuradhapoora
just
at
night
,
when
the
people
never
travel
for
fear
of
wild
beast
,
on
Sunday
,
October
12
,
be
store
with
all
thing
needful
for
their
journey
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
ten
day
'
provision
,
a
basin
to
boil
their
provision
in
,
two
calabash
to
fetch
water
in
,
and
two
great
tallipat
leave
for
tent
,
with
jaggery
,
sweetmeat
,
tobacco
,
betel
,
tinder
-
box
,
and
a
deerskin
for
shoe
,
to
keep
their
foot
from
thorn
,
because
to
them
they
chiefly
trust
.
<EOS>
be
come
to
the
river
,
they
strike
into
the
wood
,
and
keep
by
the
side
of
it
;
yet
not
go
on
the
sand
(
lest
their
footstep
should
be
discern
)
,
unless
force
,
and
then
go
backwards
.
  
<EOS>
be
get
a
good
way
into
the
wood
,
it
begin
to
rain
;
wherefore
they
erect
their
tent
,
make
a
fire
,
and
refresh
themselves
against
the
rise
of
the
moon
,
which
be
then
eighteen
day
old
;
and
have
tie
deerskin
about
their
foot
,
and
ease
themselves
of
their
ware
,
they
proceed
on
their
journey
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
travel
three
or
four
hour
with
difficulty
,
because
the
moon
give
but
little
light
among
the
thick
tree
,
they
find
an
elephant
in
their
way
before
them
,
and
because
they
could
not
scare
him
away
,
they
be
force
to
stay
till
morning
;
and
so
they
kindle
a
fire
,
and
take
a
pipe
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
by
the
light
they
could
not
discern
that
ever
anybody
have
be
there
,
nothing
be
to
be
see
but
wood
;
and
so
they
be
in
great
hope
that
they
be
past
all
danger
,
be
beyond
all
inhabitant
;
but
they
be
mistaken
,
for
the
river
wind
northward
,
bring
them
into
the
midst
of
a
parcel
of
town
,
call
Tissea
Wava
,
<EOS>
where
,
be
in
danger
of
be
see
,
they
be
under
a
mighty
terror
;
for
have
the
people
find
them
,
they
would
have
beat
them
,
and
send
them
up
to
the
king
;
and
,
to
avoid
it
,
they
creep
into
a
hollow
tree
,
and
sit
there
in
mud
and
wet
till
it
begin
to
grow
dark
,
and
then
betake
themselves
to
their
leg
,
travel
till
the
darkness
of
night
stop
them
.
<EOS>
They
hear
voice
behind
them
,
and
fear
it
be
somebody
in
pursuit
of
them
;
but
at
length
,
discern
it
be
only
an
hallooing
to
keep
the
wild
beast
out
of
the
corn
,
they
pitch
their
tent
by
the
river
,
and
have
boil
rice
and
roasted
meat
for
their
supper
,
and
satisfy
their
hunger
,
they
commit
themselves
to
God
's
keeping
,
and
lay
them
down
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
to
prevent
the
bad
,
they
get
up
early
and
hasten
on
their
journey
;
and
though
they
be
now
get
out
of
all
danger
of
the
tame
Chiangulays
,
they
be
in
great
danger
of
the
wild
one
,
of
whom
those
wood
be
full
;
and
though
they
see
their
tent
,
yet
they
be
all
go
,
since
the
rain
have
fall
,
from
the
river
into
the
wood
;
and
so
God
keep
them
from
that
danger
,
for
,
<EOS>
have
they
meet
the
wild
man
,
they
have
be
shoot
.
  
<EOS>
thus
they
travel
from
morning
till
night
several
day
,
through
bush
and
thorn
,
which
make
their
arm
and
shoulder
,
which
be
naked
,
all
of
a
gore
blood
.
<EOS>
They
often
meet
with
bear
,
hog
,
deer
,
and
wild
buffalo
;
but
they
all
run
away
as
soon
as
they
see
them
.
<EOS>
the
river
be
exceedingly
full
of
alligator
;
in
the
evening
they
use
to
pitch
their
tent
,
and
make
great
fire
both
before
and
behind
them
,
to
affright
the
wild
beast
;
and
though
they
hear
the
voice
of
all
sort
,
they
see
none
.
  
<EOS>
on
Thursday
,
at
noon
,
they
cross
the
river
coronda
[
?
<EOS>
Kannadera
Oya
]
,
which
part
the
country
of
the
Malabars
from
the
king
's
,
and
on
Friday
,
about
nine
or
ten
in
the
morning
,
come
among
the
inhabitant
,
of
whom
they
be
as
much
afraid
as
of
the
chiangulay
before
;
<EOS>
for
,
though
the
Wanniounay
,
or
prince
of
this
people
,
payeth
tribute
to
the
Dutch
out
of
fear
,
yet
he
be
better
affect
to
the
King
of
Kandy
,
and
,
if
he
have
take
them
,
would
have
send
them
up
to
their
old
master
;
but
not
know
any
way
to
escape
,
they
keep
on
their
journey
by
the
river
-
side
by
day
,
because
the
wood
be
not
to
be
travel
by
night
for
thorn
and
wild
beast
,
who
come
down
then
to
the
river
to
drink
.
<EOS>
in
all
the
Malabar
country
they
meet
with
only
two
brahmin
,
who
treat
them
very
civilly
;
and
for
their
money
,
one
of
them
conduct
them
till
they
come
into
the
territory
of
the
Dutch
,
and
out
of
all
danger
of
the
King
of
Kandy
,
which
do
not
a
little
rejoice
them
;
but
yet
they
be
in
no
small
trouble
how
to
find
the
way
out
of
the
wood
,
till
a
Malabar
,
for
the
lucre
of
a
knife
,
conduct
them
to
a
dutch
town
,
where
they
find
guide
to
conduct
them
from
town
to
town
,
till
they
come
to
the
fort
call
Aripo
,
where
they
arrive
Saturday
,
October
18
,
1679
,
and
there
thankfully
adore
God
's
wonderful
providence
,
in
thus
complete
their
deliverance
from
a
long
captivity
of
nineteen
year
and
six
month
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
now
back
to
my
own
history
,
which
grow
near
a
conclusion
,
as
to
the
travel
I
take
in
this
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
We
be
now
at
sea
,
and
we
stand
away
to
the
north
for
a
while
,
to
try
if
we
could
get
a
market
for
our
spice
,
for
we
be
very
rich
in
nutmeg
,
but
we
ill
know
what
to
do
with
them
;
we
durst
not
go
upon
the
english
coast
,
or
,
to
speak
more
properly
,
among
the
english
factory
to
trade
;
not
that
we
be
afraid
to
fight
any
two
ship
they
have
,
and
,
besides
that
,
we
know
that
,
as
they
have
no
letter
of
marque
,
or
of
reprisal
from
the
government
,
so
it
be
none
of
their
business
to
act
offensively
,
no
,
not
though
we
be
pirate
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
we
have
make
any
attempt
upon
them
,
they
may
have
justify
themselves
in
join
together
to
resist
,
and
assist
one
another
to
defend
themselves
;
but
to
go
out
of
their
business
to
attack
a
pirate
ship
of
almost
fifty
gun
,
as
we
be
,
it
be
plain
that
it
be
none
of
their
business
,
and
consequently
it
be
none
of
our
concern
,
so
we
do
not
trouble
ourselves
about
it
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
be
none
of
our
business
to
be
see
among
them
,
and
to
have
the
news
of
us
carry
from
one
factory
to
another
,
so
that
whatever
design
we
may
be
upon
at
another
time
,
we
should
be
sure
to
be
prevent
and
discover
.
<EOS>
much
less
have
we
any
occasion
to
be
see
among
any
of
the
dutch
factory
upon
the
coast
of
Malabar
;
for
,
be
fully
laden
with
the
spice
which
we
have
,
in
the
sense
of
their
trade
,
plunder
them
of
,
it
would
have
tell
them
what
we
be
,
and
all
that
we
have
be
do
;
and
they
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
concern
themselves
all
manner
of
way
to
have
fall
upon
us
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
way
we
have
for
it
be
to
stand
away
for
Goa
,
and
trade
,
if
we
could
,
for
our
spice
,
with
the
portuguese
factory
there
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
sail
almost
thither
,
for
we
have
make
land
two
day
before
,
and
be
in
the
latitude
of
Goa
,
be
stand
in
fair
for
Margaon
,
on
the
head
of
Salsat
,
at
the
go
up
to
Goa
,
when
I
call
to
the
man
at
the
helm
to
bring
the
ship
to
,
and
bid
the
pilot
go
away
N.N.W.
,
till
we
come
out
of
sight
of
the
shore
,
when
William
and
I
call
a
council
,
as
we
use
to
do
upon
emergency
,
what
course
we
should
take
to
trade
there
and
not
be
discover
;
and
we
conclude
at
length
that
we
would
not
go
thither
at
all
,
but
that
William
,
with
such
trusty
fellow
only
as
could
be
depend
upon
,
should
go
in
the
sloop
to
Surat
,
which
be
still
farther
northward
,
and
trade
there
as
merchant
with
such
of
the
English
factory
as
they
could
find
to
be
for
their
turn
.
  
<EOS>
to
carry
this
with
the
more
caution
,
and
so
as
not
to
be
suspect
,
we
agree
to
take
out
all
her
gun
,
and
put
such
man
into
her
,
and
no
other
,
as
would
promise
us
not
to
desire
or
offer
to
go
on
shore
,
or
to
enter
into
any
talk
or
conversation
with
any
that
may
come
on
board
;
and
,
to
finish
the
disguise
to
our
mind
,
William
document
two
of
our
man
,
one
a
surgeon
,
as
he
himself
be
,
and
the
other
,
a
ready
-
witted
fellow
,
an
old
sailor
,
that
have
be
a
pilot
upon
the
coast
of
New
England
,
and
be
an
excellent
mimic
;
<EOS>
these
two
William
dress
up
like
two
Quakers
,
and
make
them
talk
like
such
.
<EOS>
the
old
pilot
he
make
go
captain
of
the
sloop
,
and
the
surgeon
for
doctor
,
as
he
be
,
and
himself
supercargo
.
<EOS>
in
this
figure
,
and
the
sloop
all
plain
,
no
curled
work
upon
her
(
indeed
she
have
not
much
before
)
,
and
no
gun
to
be
see
,
away
he
go
for
Surat
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
,
indeed
,
have
observe
,
that
we
go
,
some
day
before
we
part
,
to
a
small
sandy
island
close
under
the
shore
,
where
there
be
a
good
cove
of
deep
water
,
like
a
road
,
and
out
of
sight
of
any
of
the
factory
,
which
be
here
very
thick
upon
the
coast
.
<EOS>
here
we
shift
the
loading
of
the
sloop
,
and
put
into
her
such
thing
only
as
we
have
a
mind
to
dispose
of
there
,
which
be
indeed
little
but
nutmeg
and
clove
,
but
chiefly
the
former
;
and
from
thence
William
and
his
two
Quakers
,
with
about
eighteen
man
in
the
sloop
,
go
away
to
Surat
,
and
come
to
an
anchor
at
a
distance
from
the
factory
.
  
<EOS>
William
use
such
caution
that
he
find
mean
to
go
on
shore
himself
,
and
the
doctor
,
as
he
call
him
,
in
a
boat
which
come
on
board
them
to
sell
fish
,
row
with
only
Indians
of
the
country
,
which
boat
he
afterwards
hire
to
carry
him
on
board
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
that
they
be
on
shore
,
but
that
they
find
mean
to
get
acquaintance
with
some
Englishmen
,
who
,
though
they
live
there
,
and
perhaps
be
the
company
's
servant
at
first
,
yet
appear
then
to
be
trader
for
themselves
,
in
whatever
coast
business
especially
come
in
their
way
;
and
the
doctor
be
make
the
first
to
pick
acquaintance
;
so
he
recommend
his
friend
,
the
supercargo
,
till
,
by
degree
,
the
merchant
be
as
fond
of
the
bargain
as
our
man
be
of
the
merchant
,
only
that
the
cargo
be
a
little
too
much
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
this
do
not
prove
a
difficulty
long
with
them
,
for
the
next
day
they
bring
two
more
merchant
,
English
also
,
into
their
bargain
,
and
,
as
William
could
perceive
by
their
discourse
,
they
resolve
,
if
they
buy
them
,
to
carry
them
to
the
Gulf
of
Persia
upon
their
own
account
.
<EOS>
William
take
the
hint
,
and
,
as
he
tell
me
afterwards
,
conclude
we
may
carry
them
there
as
well
as
they
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
William
's
present
business
;
he
have
here
no
less
than
three
-
and
-
thirty
ton
of
nut
and
eighteen
ton
of
clove
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
quantity
of
mace
among
the
nutmeg
,
but
we
do
not
stand
to
make
much
allowance
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
they
bargain
,
and
the
merchant
,
who
would
gladly
have
buy
sloop
and
all
,
give
William
direction
,
and
two
man
for
pilot
,
to
go
to
a
creek
about
six
league
from
the
factory
,
where
they
bring
boat
,
and
unload
the
whole
cargo
,
and
pay
William
very
honestly
for
it
;
the
whole
parcel
amount
,
in
money
,
to
about
thirty
-
five
thousand
piece
of
eight
,
besides
some
good
of
value
,
which
William
be
content
to
take
,
and
two
large
diamond
,
worth
about
three
hundred
pound
sterling
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
pay
the
money
,
William
invite
them
on
board
the
sloop
,
where
they
come
;
and
the
merry
old
Quaker
divert
them
exceedingly
with
his
talk
,
and
<EOS>
"
thee'd
"
them
and
"
thou'd
"
them
till
he
make
them
so
drunk
that
they
could
not
go
on
shore
for
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
They
would
fain
have
know
who
our
people
be
,
and
whence
they
come
;
but
not
a
man
in
the
sloop
would
answer
them
to
any
question
they
ask
,
but
in
such
a
manner
as
let
them
think
themselves
banter
and
jest
with
.
<EOS>
however
,
in
discourse
,
William
say
they
be
able
man
for
any
cargo
we
could
have
bring
them
,
and
that
they
would
have
buy
twice
as
much
spice
if
we
have
have
it
.
<EOS>
He
order
the
merry
captain
to
tell
them
that
they
have
another
sloop
that
lie
at
Margaon
,
and
that
have
a
great
quantity
of
spice
on
board
also
;
and
that
,
if
it
be
not
sell
when
he
go
back
(
for
that
thither
he
be
bind
)
,
he
would
bring
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
Their
new
chap
be
so
eager
,
that
they
would
have
bargain
with
the
old
captain
beforehand
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
friend
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
not
trade
with
thee
unsight
and
unseen
;
neither
do
I
know
whether
the
master
of
the
sloop
may
not
have
sell
his
loading
already
to
some
merchant
of
Salsat
;
but
if
he
have
not
when
I
come
to
him
,
I
think
to
bring
him
up
to
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
his
employment
all
this
while
,
as
well
as
William
and
the
old
captain
,
for
he
go
on
shore
several
time
a
day
in
the
indian
boat
,
and
bring
fresh
provision
for
the
sloop
,
which
the
man
have
nee
enough
of
.
<EOS>
He
bring
,
in
particular
,
seventeen
large
cask
of
arrack
,
as
big
as
butts
,
besides
small
quantity
,
a
quantity
of
rice
,
and
abundance
of
fruit
,
mango
,
pompion
,
and
such
thing
,
with
fowl
and
fish
.
<EOS>
He
never
come
on
board
<EOS>
but
he
be
deep
laden
;
for
,
in
short
,
he
buy
for
the
ship
as
well
as
for
themselves
;
and
,
particularly
,
they
half
-
load
the
ship
with
rice
and
arrack
,
with
some
hog
,
and
six
or
seven
cow
,
alive
;
and
thus
,
be
well
victualled
,
and
have
direction
for
come
again
,
they
return
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
William
be
always
the
lucky
welcome
messenger
to
us
,
but
never
more
welcome
to
us
than
now
;
for
where
we
have
thrust
in
the
ship
,
we
could
get
nothing
,
except
a
few
mango
and
root
,
be
not
willing
to
make
any
step
into
the
country
,
or
make
ourselves
known
till
we
have
news
of
our
sloop
;
and
indeed
our
man
's
patience
be
almost
tired
,
for
it
be
seventeen
day
that
William
spend
upon
this
enterprise
,
and
well
bestow
too
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
back
we
have
another
conference
upon
the
subject
of
trade
,
namely
,
whether
we
should
send
the
good
of
our
spice
,
and
other
good
we
have
in
the
ship
,
to
Surat
,
or
whether
we
should
go
up
to
the
Gulf
of
Persia
ourselves
,
where
it
be
probable
<EOS>
we
may
sell
them
as
well
as
the
english
merchant
of
Surat
.
<EOS>
William
be
for
go
ourselves
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
from
the
good
,
frugal
,
merchant
-
like
temper
of
the
man
,
who
be
for
the
good
of
everything
;
but
here
I
overrule
William
,
which
I
very
seldom
take
upon
me
to
do
;
but
I
tell
him
,
that
,
consider
our
circumstance
,
it
be
much
well
for
us
to
sell
all
our
cargo
here
,
though
we
make
but
<EOS>
half
-
price
of
them
,
than
to
go
with
them
to
the
Gulf
of
Persia
,
where
we
should
run
a
great
risk
,
and
where
people
would
be
much
more
curious
and
inquisitive
into
thing
than
they
be
here
,
and
where
it
would
not
be
so
easy
to
manage
them
,
see
they
trade
freely
and
openly
there
,
not
by
stealth
,
as
those
man
seem
to
do
;
and
,
besides
,
if
they
suspect
anything
,
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
for
us
to
retreat
,
except
by
mere
force
,
than
here
,
where
we
be
upon
the
high
sea
as
it
be
,
and
could
be
go
whenever
we
please
,
without
any
disguise
,
or
,
indeed
,
without
the
least
appearance
of
be
pursue
,
none
know
where
to
look
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
My
apprehension
prevail
with
William
,
whether
my
reason
do
or
no
,
and
he
submit
;
and
we
resolve
to
try
another
ship
's
loading
to
the
same
merchant
.
<EOS>
the
main
business
be
to
consider
how
to
get
off
that
circumstance
that
have
expose
them
to
the
english
merchant
,
namely
that
it
be
our
other
sloop
;
but
this
the
old
Quaker
pilot
undertake
;
for
be
,
as
I
say
,
an
excellent
mimic
himself
,
it
be
the
easy
for
him
to
dress
up
the
sloop
in
new
clothe
;
and
first
,
he
put
on
all
the
carve
work
he
have
take
off
before
;
her
stern
,
which
be
paint
of
a
dumb
white
or
dun
colour
before
,
all
flat
,
be
now
all
lacquered
and
blue
,
and
I
know
not
how
many
gay
figure
in
it
;
as
to
her
quarter
,
the
carpenter
make
her
a
neat
little
gallery
on
either
side
;
she
have
twelve
gun
put
into
her
,
and
some
petereroe
upon
her
gunnel
,
none
of
which
be
there
before
;
and
to
finish
her
new
habit
or
appearance
,
and
make
her
change
complete
,
he
order
her
sail
to
be
alter
;
and
as
she
sail
before
with
a
half
-
sprit
,
like
a
yacht
,
she
sail
now
with
square
-
sail
and
mizzen
-
mast
,
like
a
ketch
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
she
be
a
perfect
cheat
,
disguise
in
everything
that
a
stranger
could
be
suppose
to
take
any
notice
of
that
have
never
have
but
one
view
,
for
they
have
be
but
once
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
mean
figure
the
sloop
return
;
she
have
a
new
man
put
into
her
for
captain
,
one
we
know
how
to
trust
;
and
the
old
pilot
appear
only
as
a
passenger
,
the
doctor
and
William
act
as
the
supercargo
,
by
a
formal
procuration
from
one
Captain
Singleton
,
and
<EOS>
all
thing
order
in
form
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
complete
loading
for
the
sloop
;
for
,
besides
a
very
great
quantity
of
nutmeg
and
clove
,
mace
,
and
some
cinnamon
,
she
have
on
board
some
good
which
we
take
in
as
we
lay
about
the
Philippine
Islands
,
while
we
wait
as
look
for
purchase
.
  
<EOS>
William
make
no
difficulty
of
sell
this
cargo
also
,
and
in
about
twenty
day
return
again
,
freight
with
all
necessary
provision
for
our
voyage
,
and
for
a
long
time
;
and
,
as
I
say
,
we
have
a
great
deal
of
other
good
:
he
bring
us
back
about
three
-
and
-
thirty
thousand
piece
of
eight
,
and
some
diamond
,
which
,
though
William
do
not
pretend
to
much
skill
in
,
yet
he
make
shift
to
act
so
as
not
to
be
impose
upon
,
the
merchant
he
have
to
deal
with
,
too
,
be
very
fair
man
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
no
difficulty
at
all
with
these
merchant
,
for
the
prospect
they
have
of
gain
make
them
not
at
all
inquisitive
,
nor
do
they
make
the
least
discovery
of
the
sloop
;
and
as
to
the
selling
them
spice
which
be
fetch
so
far
from
thence
,
it
seem
it
be
not
so
much
a
novelty
there
as
we
believe
,
for
the
Portuguese
<EOS>
have
frequently
vessel
which
come
from
Macao
in
China
,
who
bring
spice
,
which
they
buy
of
the
chinese
trader
,
who
again
frequently
deal
among
the
Dutch
Spice
Islands
,
and
receive
spice
in
exchange
for
such
good
as
they
carry
from
China
.
  
<EOS>
this
may
be
call
,
indeed
,
the
only
trading
voyage
we
have
make
;
and
now
we
be
really
very
rich
,
and
it
come
now
naturally
before
us
to
consider
whither
we
should
go
next
.
<EOS>
Our
proper
delivery
port
,
as
we
ought
to
have
call
it
,
be
at
Madagascar
,
in
the
Bay
of
Mangahelly
;
but
William
take
me
by
myself
into
the
cabin
of
the
sloop
one
day
,
and
tell
me
he
want
to
talk
seriously
with
me
a
little
;
so
we
shut
ourselves
in
,
and
William
begin
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
wilt
thou
give
me
leave
,
"
say
William
,
"
to
talk
plainly
with
thee
upon
thy
present
circumstance
,
and
thy
future
prospect
of
living
?
<EOS>
and
wilt
thou
promise
,
on
thy
word
,
to
take
nothing
ill
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
I.
"
William
<EOS>
,
I
have
always
find
your
advice
good
,
and
your
design
have
not
only
be
well
lay
,
but
your
counsel
have
be
very
lucky
to
us
;
and
,
therefore
,
say
what
you
will
,
I
promise
you
I
will
not
take
it
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
that
be
not
all
my
demand
,
"
say
William
;
"
if
thou
dost
not
like
what
I
be
go
to
propose
to
thee
,
thou
shalt
promise
me
not
to
make
it
public
among
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
upon
my
word
;
"
and
swear
to
him
,
too
,
very
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
have
but
one
thing
more
to
article
with
thee
about
,
and
that
is
,
that
thou
wilt
consent
that
if
thou
dost
not
approve
of
it
for
thyself
,
thou
wilt
yet
consent
that
I
shall
put
so
much
of
it
in
practice
as
relate
to
myself
and
my
new
comrade
doctor
,
so
that
it
be
nothing
to
thy
detriment
and
loss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
anything
,
"
say
I
,
"
William
,
but
leave
me
,
<EOS>
I
will
;
but
I
can
not
part
with
you
upon
any
term
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
be
not
design
to
part
from
thee
,
unless
it
be
thy
own
doing
.
<EOS>
but
assure
me
in
all
these
point
,
and
I
will
tell
my
mind
freely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
promise
him
everything
he
desire
of
me
in
the
solemn
manner
possible
,
and
so
seriously
and
frankly
withal
,
that
William
make
no
scruple
to
open
his
mind
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
in
the
first
place
,
"
say
William
,
"
shall
I
ask
thee
if
thou
dost
not
think
thou
and
all
thy
man
be
rich
enough
,
and
have
really
get
as
much
wealth
together
<EOS>
(
by
whatsoever
way
it
have
be
get
,
that
be
not
the
question
)
as
we
all
know
what
to
do
with
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
truly
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
thou
art
<EOS>
pretty
right
<EOS>
;
I
think
we
have
have
pretty
good
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
would
ask
whether
,
if
thou
hast
get
enough
,
thou
hast
any
thought
of
leave
off
this
trade
;
for
most
people
leave
off
trading
when
they
be
satisfied
of
get
,
and
be
rich
enough
;
for
nobody
trade
for
the
sake
of
trading
;
much
less
do
man
rob
for
the
sake
of
thieving
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
now
I
perceive
what
it
be
thou
art
drive
at
.
<EOS>
I
warrant
you
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
begin
to
hanker
after
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
truly
,
"
say
William
,
"
thou
hast
say
it
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
hope
thou
dost
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
for
most
man
that
be
abroad
to
desire
to
come
home
again
at
last
,
especially
when
they
be
grow
rich
,
and
when
they
be
(
as
thou
ownest
thyself
to
be
)
rich
enough
,
and
so
rich
as
they
know
not
what
to
do
with
more
if
they
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
but
now
you
think
you
have
lay
your
preliminary
at
first
so
home
that
I
should
have
nothing
to
say
;
that
is
,
that
when
I
have
get
money
enough
,
it
would
be
natural
to
think
of
go
home
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
not
explain
what
you
mean
by
home
,
and
there
you
and
I
shall
differ
.
<EOS>
why
,
man
,
I
be
at
home
;
here
be
my
habitation
;
I
never
have
any
other
in
my
lifetime
;
I
be
a
kind
of
charity
school
boy
;
so
that
I
can
have
no
desire
of
go
anywhere
for
be
rich
or
poor
,
for
I
have
nowhere
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
William
,
look
a
little
confused
,
"
art
not
thou
an
Englishman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
think
so
:
you
see
I
speak
English
;
but
I
come
out
of
England
a
child
,
and
never
be
in
it
but
once
since
I
be
a
man
;
and
then
I
be
cheat
and
impose
upon
,
and
use
so
ill
that
I
care
not
if
I
never
see
it
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
hast
thou
<EOS>
no
relation
or
friend
there
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
;
"
no
acquaintance
  
none
that
thou
hast
any
kindness
or
any
remain
of
respect
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
William
,
"
say
I
;
"
no
more
than
I
have
in
the
court
of
the
Geat
Mogul
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
nor
any
kindness
for
the
country
where
thou
wast
bear
?
"
say
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
any
more
than
for
the
island
of
Madagascar
,
nor
so
much
neither
;
for
that
have
be
a
fortunate
island
to
me
more
than
once
,
as
thou
knowest
,
William
,
"
say
<EOS>
I.
  
William
be
quite
stunned
at
my
discourse
,
and
hold
his
peace
;
and
I
say
to
him
,
"
go
on
,
William
;
what
hast
thou
to
say
farther
?
<EOS>
for
I
hear
you
have
some
project
in
your
head
,
"
say
I
;
"
come
,
let
's
have
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
William
,
"
thou
hast
put
me
to
silence
,
and
all
I
have
to
say
be
overthrow
;
all
my
project
be
come
to
nothing
,
and
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
let
me
hear
what
they
be
;
for
though
it
be
so
that
what
I
have
to
aim
at
do
not
look
your
way
,
and
though
I
have
no
relation
,
no
friend
,
no
acquaintance
in
England
,
yet
I
do
not
say
I
like
this
rove
,
cruise
life
so
well
as
never
to
give
it
over
.
<EOS>
let
me
hear
if
thou
canst
propose
to
me
anything
beyond
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
friend
,
"
say
William
,
very
gravely
,
"
there
be
something
beyond
it
;
"
and
lift
up
his
hand
,
he
seem
very
much
affected
,
and
I
think
I
see
tear
stand
in
his
eye
;
but
I
,
that
be
too
harden
a
wretch
to
be
move
with
these
thing
,
laugh
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
you
mean
death
,
I
warrant
you
:
<EOS>
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
that
be
beyond
this
trade
.
<EOS>
why
,
when
it
come
,
it
come
;
then
we
be
all
provide
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
William
,
"
that
be
true
;
but
it
would
be
well
that
some
thing
be
think
on
before
that
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
think
on
!
"
say
I
;
"
what
signify
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
to
think
of
death
be
to
die
,
and
to
be
always
think
of
it
be
to
be
all
one
's
life
long
a
-
dying
.
<EOS>
It
be
time
enough
to
think
of
it
when
it
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
You
will
easily
believe
I
be
well
qualified
for
a
pirate
that
could
talk
thus
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
leave
it
upon
record
,
for
the
remark
of
other
hardened
rogue
like
myself
,
 
my
conscience
give
me
a
pang
that
I
never
feel
before
when
I
say
,
"
what
signify
think
of
it
?
"
and
tell
me
I
should
one
day
think
of
these
word
with
a
sad
heart
;
but
the
time
of
my
reflection
be
not
yet
come
;
so
I
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
say
William
very
seriously
,
"
I
must
tell
thee
,
friend
,
I
be
sorry
to
hear
thee
talk
so
.
<EOS>
They
that
never
think
of
die
,
often
die
without
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
carry
on
the
jesting
way
a
while
farther
,
and
say
,
"
Prithee
,
do
not
talk
of
die
;
how
do
we
know
we
shall
ever
die
?
"
and
begin
to
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
answer
thee
to
that
,
"
say
William
;
"
it
be
not
my
place
to
reprove
thee
,
who
art
commander
over
me
here
;
but
I
would
rather
thou
wouldst
talk
otherwise
of
death
;
it
be
a
coarse
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
say
anything
to
me
,
William
,
"
say
I
;
"
I
will
take
it
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
now
to
be
very
much
move
at
his
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
say
William
(
tear
run
down
his
face
)
,
<EOS>
"
It
be
because
man
live
as
if
they
be
never
to
die
,
that
so
many
die
before
they
know
how
to
live
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
death
that
I
mean
when
I
say
that
there
be
something
to
be
think
of
beyond
this
way
of
living
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
repentance
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
you
ever
know
a
pirate
repent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
he
startle
a
little
,
and
return
,
"
<EOS>
at
the
gallow
I
have
[
know
]
one
before
,
and
I
hope
thou
wilt
be
the
second
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
this
very
affectionately
,
with
an
appearance
of
concern
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
thank
you
;
and
I
be
not
so
senseless
of
these
thing
,
perhaps
,
as
I
make
myself
seem
to
be
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
let
me
hear
your
proposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
proposal
,
"
say
William
,
"
be
for
thy
good
as
well
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
We
may
put
an
end
to
this
kind
of
life
,
and
repent
;
and
I
think
the
fair
occasion
offer
for
both
,
at
this
very
time
,
that
ever
do
,
or
ever
will
,
or
,
indeed
,
can
happen
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
you
,
William
,
"
say
I
;
"
let
me
have
your
proposal
for
put
an
end
to
our
present
way
of
live
first
,
for
that
<EOS>
be
the
case
before
us
,
and
you
and
I
will
talk
of
the
other
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
insensible
,
"
say
I
,
"
as
you
may
think
me
to
be
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
get
out
of
this
hellish
condition
we
be
in
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
William
,
"
thou
art
in
the
right
there
<EOS>
;
we
must
never
talk
of
repenting
while
we
continue
pirate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
William
,
that
be
what
I
mean
;
for
if
we
must
not
reform
,
as
well
as
be
sorry
for
what
be
do
,
I
have
no
notion
what
repentance
mean
;
indeed
,
at
best
I
know
little
of
the
matter
;
but
the
nature
of
the
thing
seem
to
tell
me
that
the
first
step
we
have
to
take
be
to
break
off
this
wretched
course
;
and
I
will
begin
there
with
you
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
see
by
his
countenance
that
William
be
thoroughly
pleased
with
the
offer
;
and
if
he
have
tear
in
-
his
eye
before
,
he
have
more
now
;
but
it
be
from
quite
a
different
passion
;
for
he
be
so
swallow
up
with
joy
he
could
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
thou
showest
me
plain
enough
<EOS>
thou
hast
an
honest
meaning
<EOS>
;
dost
thou
think
it
practicable
for
us
to
put
an
end
to
our
unhappy
way
of
live
here
,
and
get
off
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
think
it
very
practicable
for
me
;
whether
it
be
for
thee
or
no
,
that
will
depend
upon
thyself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
give
you
my
word
,
that
as
I
have
command
you
all
along
,
from
the
time
I
first
take
you
on
board
,
so
you
shall
command
me
from
this
hour
,
and
everything
you
direct
me
<EOS>
I
will
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
wilt
thou
leave
it
all
to
me
?
<EOS>
dost
thou
say
this
freely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
freely
;
and
I
will
perform
it
faithfully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
William
,
"
<EOS>
my
scheme
be
this
:
We
be
now
at
the
mouth
of
the
Gulf
of
Persia
;
we
have
sell
so
much
of
our
cargo
here
at
Surat
,
that
we
have
money
enough
;
send
me
away
for
Bassorah
with
the
sloop
,
laden
with
the
China
good
we
have
on
board
,
which
will
make
another
good
cargo
,
and
I
will
warrant
thee
<EOS>
I
will
find
mean
,
among
the
english
and
dutch
merchant
there
,
to
lodge
a
quantity
of
good
and
money
also
as
a
merchant
,
so
as
we
will
be
able
to
have
recourse
to
it
again
upon
any
occasion
,
and
when
I
come
home
we
will
contrive
the
rest
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
do
you
bring
the
ship
's
crew
to
take
a
resolution
to
go
to
Madagascar
as
soon
as
I
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
think
he
nee
not
go
so
far
as
Bassorah
,
but
may
run
into
Gombroon
,
or
to
Ormuz
,
and
pretend
the
same
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
can
not
act
with
the
same
freedom
there
,
because
the
company
's
factory
be
there
,
and
I
may
be
lay
hold
of
there
on
pretence
of
interlope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
may
go
to
Ormuz
,
then
;
for
I
be
loth
to
part
with
you
so
long
as
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
Persian
Gulf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
return
,
that
I
should
leave
it
to
him
to
do
as
he
should
see
cause
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
take
a
large
sum
of
money
at
Surat
,
so
that
we
have
near
a
hundred
thousand
pound
in
money
at
our
command
,
but
on
board
the
great
ship
we
have
still
a
great
deal
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
order
him
publicly
to
keep
the
money
on
board
which
he
have
,
and
to
buy
up
with
it
a
quantity
of
ammunition
,
if
he
could
get
it
,
and
so
to
furnish
us
for
new
exploit
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
I
resolve
to
get
a
quantity
of
gold
and
some
jewel
,
which
I
have
on
board
the
great
ship
,
and
place
them
so
that
I
may
carry
them
off
without
notice
as
soon
as
he
come
back
;
and
so
,
accord
to
William
's
direction
,
I
leave
him
to
go
the
voyage
,
and
I
go
on
board
the
great
ship
,
in
which
we
have
indeed
an
immense
treasure
.
  
<EOS>
We
wait
no
less
than
two
month
for
William
's
return
,
and
indeed
I
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
about
William
,
sometimes
think
he
have
abandon
me
,
and
that
he
may
have
use
the
same
artifice
to
have
engage
the
other
man
to
comply
with
him
,
and
so
they
be
go
away
together
;
and
it
be
but
three
day
before
his
return
that
I
be
just
upon
the
point
of
resolve
to
go
away
to
Madagascar
,
and
give
him
over
;
but
the
old
surgeon
,
who
mimic
the
Quaker
and
pass
for
the
master
of
the
sloop
at
Surat
,
persuade
me
against
that
,
for
which
good
advice
and
apparent
faithfulness
in
what
he
have
be
trust
with
,
I
make
him
a
party
to
my
design
,
and
he
prove
very
honest
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
William
come
back
,
to
our
inexpressible
joy
,
and
bring
a
great
many
necessary
thing
with
him
;
as
,
particularly
,
he
bring
sixty
barrel
of
powder
,
some
iron
shot
,
and
about
thirty
ton
of
lead
;
also
he
bring
a
great
deal
of
provision
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
William
give
me
a
public
account
of
his
voyage
,
in
the
hearing
of
whoever
happen
to
be
upon
the
quarter
-
deck
,
that
no
suspicion
may
be
find
about
us
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
be
do
,
William
move
that
he
may
go
up
again
,
and
that
I
would
go
with
him
;
name
several
thing
which
we
have
on
board
that
he
could
not
sell
there
;
and
,
particularly
,
tell
us
he
have
be
oblige
to
leave
several
thing
there
,
the
caravan
be
not
come
in
;
and
that
he
have
engage
to
come
back
again
with
good
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
eager
for
his
going
,
and
particularly
because
he
tell
them
they
may
load
the
sloop
back
with
rice
and
provision
;
but
I
seem
backward
to
go
,
when
the
old
surgeon
stand
up
and
persuade
me
to
go
,
and
with
many
argument
press
me
to
it
;
as
,
particularly
,
if
I
do
not
go
,
there
would
be
no
order
,
and
several
of
the
man
may
drop
away
,
and
perhaps
betray
all
the
rest
;
and
that
they
should
not
think
it
safe
for
the
sloop
to
go
again
if
I
do
not
go
;
and
to
urge
me
to
it
,
he
offer
himself
to
go
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
consideration
I
seem
to
be
over
-
persuade
to
go
,
and
all
the
company
seem
to
be
better
satisfied
when
I
have
consent
;
and
,
accordingly
,
we
take
all
the
powder
,
lead
,
and
iron
out
of
the
sloop
into
the
great
ship
,
and
all
the
other
thing
that
be
for
the
ship
's
use
,
and
put
in
some
bale
of
spice
and
cask
or
frail
of
clove
,
in
all
about
seven
ton
,
and
some
other
good
,
among
the
bale
of
which
I
have
convey
all
my
private
treasure
,
which
,
I
assure
you
,
be
of
no
small
value
,
and
away
I
go
.
  
<EOS>
at
go
off
I
call
a
council
of
all
the
officer
in
the
ship
to
consider
in
what
place
they
should
wait
for
me
,
and
how
long
,
and
we
appoint
the
ship
to
stay
eight
-
and
-
twenty
day
at
a
little
island
on
the
arabian
side
of
the
Gulf
,
and
that
,
if
the
sloop
do
not
come
in
that
time
,
they
should
sail
to
another
island
to
the
west
of
that
place
,
and
wait
there
fifteen
day
more
,
and
that
then
,
if
the
sloop
do
not
come
,
they
should
conclude
some
accident
must
have
happen
,
and
the
rendezvous
should
be
at
Madagascar
.
  
<EOS>
be
thus
resolve
,
we
leave
the
ship
,
which
both
William
and
I
,
and
the
surgeon
,
never
intend
to
see
any
more
.
<EOS>
We
steer
directly
for
the
Gulf
,
and
through
to
Bassorah
,
or
Balsara
.
<EOS>
this
city
of
Balsara
lie
at
some
distance
from
the
place
where
our
sloop
lie
,
and
the
river
not
be
very
safe
,
and
we
but
ill
acquaint
with
it
,
have
but
<EOS>
an
ordinary
pilot
<EOS>
,
we
go
on
shore
at
a
village
where
some
merchant
live
,
and
which
be
very
populous
,
for
the
sake
of
small
vessel
ride
there
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
stay
and
trade
three
or
four
day
,
land
all
our
bale
and
spice
,
and
indeed
the
whole
cargo
that
be
of
any
considerable
value
,
which
we
choose
to
do
rather
than
go
up
immediately
to
Balsara
till
the
project
we
have
lay
be
put
in
execution
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
buy
several
good
,
and
be
prepare
to
buy
several
other
,
the
boat
be
on
shore
with
twelve
man
,
myself
,
William
,
the
surgeon
,
and
one
fourth
man
,
whom
we
have
single
out
,
we
contrive
to
send
a
Turk
just
at
the
dusk
of
the
evening
with
a
letter
to
the
boatswain
,
and
give
the
fellow
a
charge
to
run
with
all
possible
speed
,
we
stand
at
a
small
distance
to
observe
the
event
.
<EOS>
the
content
of
the
letter
be
thus
write
by
the
old
doctor
:
    
"
BOATSWAIN
THOMAS

We
be
all

<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
make
off
with
the
boat
,
and
get
on
board
,
or
you
be
all
lose

<EOS>
the
captain

William
the
Quaker

and
George
the
reformade
be
seize
and
carry
away
:
I
be
escape
and
hide
,
but
can
not
stir
out
;
if
I
do
I
am
a
dead
man
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
you
be
on
board
cut
or
slip
,
and
make
sail
for
your
life
.

Adieu

<EOS>
We
stand
undiscovered
,
as
above
,
it
be
the
dusk
of
the
evening
,
and
see
the
Turk
deliver
the
letter
,
and
in
three
minute
we
see
all
the
man
hurry
into
the
boat
and
put
off
,
and
no
sooner
be
they
on
board
than
they
take
the
hint
,
as
we
suppose
,
<EOS>
for
the
next
morning
they
be
out
of
sight
,
and
we
never
hear
tale
or
tiding
of
them
since
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
in
a
good
place
,
and
in
very
good
circumstance
,
for
we
pass
for
merchant
of
Persia
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
material
to
record
here
what
a
mass
of
ill
-
get
wealth
we
have
get
together
:
it
will
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
tell
you
that
I
begin
to
be
sensible
of
the
crime
of
get
of
it
in
such
a
manner
as
I
have
do
;
that
I
have
very
little
satisfaction
in
the
possession
of
it
;
and
,
as
I
tell
William
,
I
have
no
expectation
of
keep
it
,
nor
much
desire
;
but
,
as
I
say
to
him
one
day
walk
out
into
the
field
near
the
town
of
Bassorah
,
so
I
depend
upon
it
that
it
would
be
the
case
,
which
you
will
hear
presently
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
perfectly
secure
at
Bassorah
,
by
have
fright
away
the
rogue
,
our
comrade
;
and
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
consider
how
to
convert
our
treasure
into
thing
proper
to
make
us
look
like
merchant
,
as
we
be
now
to
be
,
and
not
like
freebooter
,
as
we
really
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
We
happen
very
opportunely
here
upon
a
Dutchman
,
who
have
travel
from
Bengal
to
Agra
,
the
capital
city
of
the
Great
Mogul
,
and
from
thence
be
come
to
the
coast
of
Malabar
by
land
,
and
get
shipping
,
somehow
or
other
,
up
the
Gulf
;
and
we
find
his
design
be
to
go
up
the
great
river
to
Bagdad
or
Babylon
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
the
caravan
,
to
Aleppo
and
Scanderoon
.
<EOS>
as
William
speak
Dutch
,
and
be
of
an
agreeable
,
insinuate
behaviour
,
he
soon
get
acquaint
with
this
dutchman
,
and
discover
our
circumstance
to
one
another
,
we
find
he
have
considerable
effect
with
him
;
and
that
he
have
trade
long
in
that
country
,
and
be
make
homeward
to
his
own
country
;
and
that
he
have
servant
with
him
;
one
an
Armenian
,
whom
he
have
teach
to
speak
Dutch
,
and
who
have
something
of
his
own
,
but
have
a
mind
to
travel
into
Europe
;
and
the
other
a
dutch
sailor
,
whom
he
have
pick
up
by
his
fancy
,
and
repose
a
great
trust
in
him
,
and
a
very
honest
fellow
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
this
dutchman
be
very
glad
of
an
acquaintance
,
because
he
soon
find
that
we
direct
our
thought
to
Europe
also
;
and
as
he
find
we
be
encumber
with
good
<EOS>
only
(
for
we
let
him
know
nothing
of
our
money
)
,
he
readily
offer
us
his
assistance
to
dispose
of
as
many
of
them
as
the
place
we
be
in
would
put
off
,
and
his
advice
what
to
do
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
be
do
,
William
and
I
consult
what
to
do
with
ourselves
and
what
we
have
;
and
first
,
we
resolve
we
would
never
talk
seriously
of
our
measure
but
in
the
open
field
,
where
we
be
sure
nobody
could
hear
;
so
every
evening
,
when
the
sun
begin
to
decline
and
the
air
to
be
moderate
we
walk
out
,
sometimes
this
way
,
sometimes
that
,
to
consult
of
our
affair
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
observe
that
we
have
new
clothe
ourselves
here
,
after
the
persian
manner
,
with
long
vest
of
silk
,
a
gown
or
robe
of
English
crimson
cloth
,
very
fine
and
handsome
,
and
have
let
our
beard
grow
so
after
the
persian
manner
that
we
pass
for
persian
merchant
,
in
view
only
,
though
,
by
the
way
,
we
could
not
understand
or
speak
one
word
of
the
language
of
Persia
,
or
indeed
of
any
other
but
english
and
Dutch
;
and
of
the
latter
I
understand
very
little
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
Dutchman
supply
all
this
for
us
;
and
as
we
have
resolve
to
keep
ourselves
as
retire
as
we
could
,
though
there
be
several
english
merchant
upon
the
place
,
yet
we
never
acquaint
ourselves
with
one
of
them
,
or
exchange
a
word
with
them
;
by
which
mean
we
prevent
their
inquiry
of
us
now
,
or
their
give
any
intelligence
of
us
,
if
any
news
of
our
landing
here
should
happen
to
come
,
which
,
it
be
easy
for
us
to
know
,
be
possible
enough
,
if
any
of
our
comrade
fall
into
bad
hand
,
or
by
many
accident
which
we
could
not
foresee
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
during
my
being
here
,
for
here
we
stay
near
two
month
,
that
I
grow
very
thoughtful
about
my
circumstance
;
not
as
to
the
danger
,
neither
indeed
be
we
in
any
,
but
be
entirely
conceal
and
unsuspected
;
but
I
really
begin
to
have
other
thought
of
myself
,
and
of
the
world
,
than
ever
I
have
before
.
  
<EOS>
William
have
strike
so
deep
into
my
unthinking
temper
with
hinting
to
me
that
there
be
something
beyond
all
this
;
that
the
present
time
be
the
time
of
enjoyment
,
but
that
the
time
of
account
approach
;
that
the
work
that
remain
be
gentle
than
the
labour
past
,
viz
.
,
repentance
,
and
that
it
be
high
time
to
think
of
it
;
 
I
say
these
,
and
such
thought
as
these
,
engross
my
hour
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
grow
very
sad
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
wealth
I
have
,
which
be
immensely
great
,
it
be
all
like
dirt
under
my
foot
;
I
have
no
value
for
it
,
no
peace
in
the
possession
of
it
,
no
great
concern
about
me
for
the
leaving
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
William
have
perceive
my
thought
to
be
trouble
and
my
mind
heavy
and
oppress
for
some
time
;
and
one
evening
,
in
one
of
our
cool
walk
,
I
begin
with
him
about
the
leave
our
effect
.
<EOS>
William
be
a
wise
and
wary
man
,
and
indeed
all
the
prudential
of
my
conduct
have
for
a
long
time
be
owe
to
his
advice
,
and
so
now
all
the
method
for
preserve
our
effect
,
and
even
ourselves
,
lie
upon
him
;
and
he
have
be
tell
me
of
some
of
the
measure
he
have
be
take
for
our
make
homeward
,
and
for
the
security
of
our
wealth
,
when
I
take
him
very
short
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
dost
thou
think
we
shall
ever
be
able
to
reach
Europe
with
all
this
cargo
that
we
have
about
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
William
,
"
without
doubt
,
as
well
as
other
merchant
with
theirs
,
as
long
as
it
be
not
publicly
know
what
quantity
or
of
what
value
our
cargo
consist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
smile
,
"
do
you
think
that
if
there
be
a
God
above
,
as
you
have
so
long
be
tell
me
there
be
,
and
that
we
must
give
an
account
to
Him
,
 
I
say
,
do
you
think
,
<EOS>
if
He
be
a
righteous
judge
,
He
will
let
us
escape
thus
with
the
plunder
,
as
we
may
call
it
,
of
so
many
innocent
people
,
nay
,
I
may
say
nation
,
and
not
call
us
to
an
account
for
it
before
we
can
get
to
Europe
,
where
we
pretend
to
enjoy
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
William
appear
strike
and
surprise
at
the
question
,
and
make
no
answer
for
a
great
while
;
and
I
repeat
the
question
,
add
that
it
be
not
to
be
expect
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
little
pause
,
say
William
,
"
Thou
hast
start
a
very
weighty
question
,
and
I
can
make
no
positive
answer
to
it
;
but
I
will
state
it
thus
:
first
,
it
be
true
that
,
if
we
consider
the
justice
of
God
,
we
have
no
reason
to
expect
any
protection
;
but
as
the
ordinary
way
of
Providence
be
out
of
the
common
road
of
human
affair
,
so
we
may
hope
for
mercy
still
upon
our
repentance
,
and
we
know
not
how
good
He
may
be
to
us
;
so
we
be
to
act
as
if
we
rather
depend
upon
the
last
,
I
mean
the
merciful
part
,
than
claim
the
first
,
which
must
produce
nothing
but
judgment
and
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
hark
ye
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
nature
of
repentance
,
as
you
have
hint
once
to
me
,
include
reformation
;
and
we
can
never
reform
;
how
,
then
,
can
we
repent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
can
we
never
reform
?
"
say
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
say
I
,
"
we
can
not
restore
what
we
have
take
away
by
rapine
and
spoil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
"
say
William
,
"
we
never
can
do
that
,
for
we
can
never
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
owner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
,
then
,
must
be
do
with
our
wealth
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
effect
of
plunder
and
rapine
?
<EOS>
if
we
keep
it
,
we
continue
to
be
robber
and
thief
;
and
if
we
quit
it
we
can
not
do
justice
with
it
,
for
we
can
not
restore
it
to
the
right
owner
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
say
William
,
"
the
answer
to
it
be
short
.
<EOS>
to
quit
what
we
have
,
and
do
it
here
,
be
to
throw
it
away
to
those
who
have
no
claim
to
it
,
and
to
divest
ourselves
of
it
,
but
to
do
no
right
with
it
;
whereas
we
ought
to
keep
it
carefully
together
,
with
a
resolution
to
do
what
right
with
it
<EOS>
we
be
able
;
and
who
know
what
opportunity
Providence
may
put
into
our
hand
to
do
justice
,
at
least
,
to
some
of
those
we
have
injure
?
<EOS>
so
we
ought
,
at
least
,
to
leave
it
to
Him
and
go
on
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
without
doubt
our
present
business
be
to
go
to
some
place
of
safety
,
where
we
may
wait
His
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
resolution
of
William
be
very
satisfying
to
me
indeed
,
as
,
the
truth
be
,
all
he
say
,
and
at
all
time
,
be
solid
and
good
;
and
have
not
William
thus
,
as
it
be
,
quiet
my
mind
,
I
think
,
verily
<EOS>
,
I
be
so
alarm
at
the
just
reason
I
have
to
expect
vengeance
from
Heaven
upon
me
for
my
ill
-
get
wealth
,
that
I
should
have
run
away
from
it
as
the
devil
's
good
,
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
,
<EOS>
that
do
not
belong
to
me
,
and
that
I
have
no
right
to
keep
,
and
be
in
certain
danger
of
be
destroy
for
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
William
settle
my
mind
to
more
prudent
step
than
these
,
and
I
conclude
that
I
ought
,
however
,
to
proceed
to
a
place
of
safety
,
and
leave
the
event
to
God
Almighty
's
mercy
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
must
leave
upon
record
,
that
I
have
from
this
time
no
joy
of
the
wealth
I
have
get
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
it
all
as
steal
,
and
so
indeed
the
great
part
of
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
it
as
a
hoard
of
other
man
's
good
,
which
I
have
rob
the
innocent
owner
of
,
and
which
I
ought
,
in
a
word
,
to
be
hang
for
here
,
and
damn
for
hereafter
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
indeed
,
I
begin
sincerely
to
hate
myself
for
a
dog
;
a
wretch
that
have
be
a
thief
and
a
murderer
;
a
wretch
that
be
in
a
condition
which
nobody
be
ever
in
;
for
I
have
rob
,
and
though
I
have
the
wealth
by
me
,
yet
it
be
impossible
I
should
ever
make
any
restitution
;
and
upon
this
account
it
run
in
my
head
that
I
could
never
repent
,
for
that
repentance
could
not
be
sincere
without
restitution
,
and
therefore
must
of
necessity
be
damn
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
room
for
me
to
escape
.
<EOS>
I
go
about
with
my
heart
full
of
these
thought
,
little
well
than
a
distract
fellow
;
in
short
,
run
headlong
into
the
dreadfull
despair
,
and
premeditate
nothing
but
how
to
rid
myself
out
of
the
world
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
devil
,
if
such
thing
be
of
the
devil
's
immediate
doing
,
follow
his
work
very
close
with
me
,
and
nothing
lie
upon
my
mind
for
several
day
but
to
shoot
myself
into
the
head
with
my
pistol
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
all
this
while
in
a
vagrant
life
,
among
infidel
,
Turks
,
pagan
,
and
such
sort
of
people
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
minister
,
no
Christian
to
converse
with
but
poor
William
.
<EOS>
He
be
my
ghostly
father
or
confessor
,
and
he
be
all
the
comfort
I
have
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
knowledge
of
religion
,
you
have
hear
my
history
.
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
I
have
not
much
;
and
as
for
the
Word
of
God
,
I
do
not
remember
that
I
ever
read
a
chapter
in
the
Bible
in
my
lifetime
.
<EOS>
I
be
little
Bob
at
Bussleton
,
and
go
to
school
to
learn
my
Testament
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
please
God
to
make
William
the
Quaker
everything
to
me
.
<EOS>
upon
this
occasion
,
I
take
him
out
one
evening
,
as
usual
,
and
hurry
him
away
into
the
field
with
me
,
in
more
haste
than
ordinary
;
and
there
,
in
short
,
I
tell
him
the
perplexity
of
my
mind
,
and
under
what
terrible
temptation
of
the
devil
I
have
be
;
that
I
must
shoot
myself
,
for
I
could
not
support
the
weight
and
terror
that
be
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
shoot
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
say
William
;
"
why
,
what
will
that
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
will
put
an
end
to
a
miserable
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
William
,
"
be
you
satisfied
the
next
will
be
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
I
;
"
much
bad
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
shoot
yourself
be
the
devil
's
motion
,
no
doubt
;
for
it
be
the
devil
of
a
reason
,
that
,
because
thou
art
in
an
ill
case
,
therefore
thou
must
put
thyself
into
a
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
shock
my
reason
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
"
say
I
,
"
there
be
no
bear
the
miserable
condition
I
be
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
well
,
"
say
William
;
"
but
it
seem
there
be
some
bear
a
bad
condition
;
and
so
you
will
shoot
yourself
,
that
you
may
be
past
remedy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
past
remedy
already
,
"
say
<EOS>
I.
  
"
how
do
you
know
that
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
satisfied
of
it
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
you
be
not
sure
;
so
you
will
shoot
yourself
to
make
it
certain
;
for
though
on
this
side
death
you
can
not
be
sure
you
will
be
damn
at
all
,
yet
the
moment
you
step
on
the
other
side
of
time
you
be
sure
of
it
;
for
when
it
be
do
,
it
be
not
to
be
say
then
that
you
will
be
,
but
that
you
be
damned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
,
"
say
William
,
as
if
he
have
be
between
jest
and
earnest
,
"
pray
,
<EOS>
what
didst
thou
dream
of
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
frightful
dream
all
night
;
and
,
particularly
,
I
dream
that
the
devil
come
for
me
,

"
<EOS>
Trade

<EOS>

say
I
;
"
I
be
a
thief
,
a
rogue
,
by
my
calling
:
I
be
a
pirate
and
a
murderer
,
and
ought
to
be

<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
so
you
do
;
and
you
be
the
man
I
look
for

and
therefore

along
with
me

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
I
be
most
horribly
fright
,
and
cry
out
so
that

wake
me
;
and
I
have
be
in
horrible
agony
ever
since

<EOS>
"
  
"

well

say
William
;
"
come
,
give
me
the
pistol

talkedst
of
just
now

<EOS>
"
why

I
,
"
what
will
you
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
with
it

"
say
William
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
thou
needest
not
shoot
thyself
;
I
shall
be
oblige
to
do
it
for
thee

<EOS>
why

thou
wilt
destroy
us
all

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean

William
?
"
say
I.
  
"
Mean

"
<EOS>
say
he
;
"
nay
,
what
didst
thou
mean
,
to
cry
out
aloud
in
thy
sleep
,
"
I
be
a
thief

a
pirate

a
murderer

why

wilt
ruin
us
all

'
<EOS>
Twas
<EOS>
well
the
dutchman
do
not
understand
English
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
must
shoot
thee
,
to
save
my
own
life
.
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
"
say
he
,
"
give
me
thy
pistol
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
confess
this
terrify
me
again
another
way
,
and
I
begin
to
be
sensible
that
,
if
anybody
have
be
near
me
to
understand
English
,
I
have
be
undo
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
shoot
myself
forsook
me
from
that
time
;
and
I
turn
to
William
,
"
You
disorder
me
extremely
,
William
,
"
say
I
;
"
why
,
I
be
never
safe
,
nor
be
it
safe
to
keep
me
company
.
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
shall
betray
you
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
friend
Bob
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
an
end
to
it
all
,
if
you
will
take
my
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
that
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
only
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
the
next
time
thou
talk
with
the
devil
,
thou
wilt
talk
a
little
softli
,
or
we
shall
be
all
undone
,
and
you
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
fright
me
,
I
must
confess
,
and
allay
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
of
mind
I
be
in
.
<EOS>
but
William
,
after
he
have
do
jest
with
me
,
enter
upon
a
very
long
and
serious
discourse
with
me
about
the
nature
of
my
circumstance
,
and
about
repentance
;
that
it
ought
to
be
attend
,
indeed
,
with
a
deep
abhorrence
of
the
crime
that
I
have
to
charge
myself
with
;
but
that
to
despair
of
God
's
mercy
be
no
part
of
repentance
,
but
put
myself
into
the
condition
of
the
devil
;
indeed
,
that
I
must
apply
myself
with
a
sincere
,
humble
confession
of
my
crime
,
to
ask
pardon
of
God
,
whom
I
have
offend
,
and
cast
myself
upon
His
mercy
,
resolve
to
be
willing
to
make
restitution
,
if
ever
it
should
please
God
to
put
it
in
my
power
,
even
to
the
utmost
of
what
I
have
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
he
tell
me
,
be
the
method
which
he
have
resolve
upon
himself
;
and
in
this
,
he
tell
me
,
he
have
find
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
in
William
's
discourse
,
and
it
quiet
me
very
much
;
but
William
be
very
anxious
ever
after
about
my
talking
in
my
sleep
,
and
take
care
to
lie
with
me
always
himself
,
and
to
keep
me
from
lodge
in
any
house
where
so
much
as
a
word
of
English
be
understand
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
not
the
like
occasion
afterward
;
for
I
be
much
more
composed
in
my
mind
,
and
resolve
for
the
future
to
live
a
quite
different
life
from
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
wealth
I
have
,
I
look
upon
it
as
nothing
;
I
resolve
to
set
it
apart
to
any
such
opportunity
of
do
justice
as
God
should
put
into
my
hand
;
and
the
miraculous
opportunity
I
have
afterwards
of
apply
some
part
of
it
to
preserve
a
ruin
family
,
whom
I
have
plunder
,
may
be
worth
read
,
if
I
have
room
for
it
in
this
account
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
resolution
I
begin
to
be
restore
to
some
degree
of
quiet
in
my
mind
;
and
have
,
after
almost
three
month
'
stay
at
Bassorah
,
dispose
of
some
good
,
but
have
a
great
quantity
leave
,
we
hire
boat
accord
to
the
Dutchman
's
direction
,
and
go
up
to
Bagdad
,
or
Babylon
,
on
the
river
Tigris
,
or
rather
Euphrates
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
very
considerable
cargo
of
good
with
us
,
and
therefore
make
a
great
figure
there
,
and
be
receive
with
respect
.
<EOS>
We
have
,
in
particular
,
two
-
and
-
forty
bale
of
indian
stuff
of
sundry
sort
,
silk
,
muslin
,
and
fine
chintz
;
we
have
fifteen
bale
of
very
fine
China
silk
,
and
seventy
pack
or
bale
of
spice
,
particularly
clove
and
nutmeg
,
with
other
good
.
<EOS>
We
be
bid
money
here
for
our
clove
,
but
the
dutchman
advise
us
not
to
part
with
them
,
and
tell
us
we
should
get
a
well
price
at
Aleppo
,
or
in
the
levant
;
so
we
prepare
for
the
caravan
.
  
<EOS>
We
conceal
our
have
any
gold
or
pearl
as
much
as
we
could
,
and
therefore
sell
three
or
four
bale
of
China
silk
and
indian
calico
,
to
raise
money
to
buy
camel
and
to
pay
the
custom
which
be
take
at
several
place
,
and
for
our
provision
over
the
desert
.
  
<EOS>
I
travel
this
journey
,
careless
to
the
last
degree
of
my
good
or
wealth
,
believe
that
,
as
I
come
by
it
all
by
rapine
and
violence
,
God
would
direct
that
it
should
be
take
from
me
again
in
the
same
manner
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
think
I
may
say
I
be
very
willing
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
have
a
merciful
Protector
above
me
,
so
I
have
a
most
faithful
steward
,
counsellor
,
partner
,
or
whatever
I
may
call
him
,
who
be
my
guide
,
my
pilot
,
my
governor
,
my
everything
,
and
take
care
both
of
me
and
of
all
we
have
;
and
though
he
have
never
be
in
any
of
these
part
of
the
world
,
yet
he
take
the
care
of
all
upon
him
;
and
in
about
nine
-
and
-
fifty
day
we
arrive
from
Bassorah
,
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
Tigris
or
Euphrates
,
through
the
desert
,
and
through
Aleppo
to
Alexandria
,
or
,
as
we
call
it
,
Scanderoon
,
in
the
Levant
.
  
<EOS>
here
William
and
I
,
and
the
other
two
,
our
faithful
comrade
,
debate
what
we
should
do
;
and
here
William
and
I
resolve
to
separate
from
the
other
two
,
they
resolve
to
go
with
the
Dutchman
into
Holland
,
by
the
mean
of
some
dutch
ship
which
lie
then
in
the
road
.
<EOS>
William
and
I
tell
them
we
resolve
to
go
and
settle
in
the
Morea
,
which
then
belong
to
the
Venetians
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
we
act
wisely
in
it
not
to
let
them
know
whither
we
go
,
see
we
have
resolve
to
separate
;
but
we
take
our
old
doctor
's
direction
how
to
write
to
him
in
Holland
,
and
in
England
,
that
we
may
have
intelligence
from
him
on
occasion
,
and
promise
to
give
him
an
account
how
to
write
to
us
,
which
we
afterwards
do
,
as
may
in
time
be
make
out
.
  
<EOS>
We
stay
here
some
time
after
they
be
go
,
till
at
length
,
not
be
thoroughly
resolve
whither
to
go
till
then
,
a
venetian
ship
touch
at
Cyprus
,
and
put
in
at
scanderoon
to
look
for
freight
home
.
<EOS>
We
take
the
hint
,
and
bargaining
for
our
passage
,
and
the
freight
of
our
good
,
we
embark
for
Venice
,
where
,
in
two
-
and
-
twenty
day
,
we
arrive
safe
,
with
all
our
treasure
,
and
with
such
a
cargo
,
take
our
good
and
our
money
and
our
jewel
together
,
as
,
I
believe
,
be
never
bring
into
the
city
by
two
single
man
,
since
the
state
of
Venice
have
a
being
.
  
<EOS>
We
keep
ourselves
here
incognito
for
a
great
while
,
pass
for
two
armenian
merchant
still
,
as
we
have
do
before
;
and
by
this
time
we
have
get
so
much
of
the
persian
and
armenian
jargon
,
which
they
talk
at
Bassorah
and
Bagdad
,
and
everywhere
that
we
come
in
the
country
,
as
be
sufficient
to
make
us
able
to
talk
to
one
another
,
so
as
not
to
be
understand
by
anybody
,
though
sometimes
hardly
by
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
convert
all
our
effect
into
money
,
settle
our
abode
as
for
a
considerable
time
,
and
William
and
I
,
maintain
an
inviolable
friendship
and
fidelity
to
one
another
,
live
like
two
brother
;
we
neither
have
or
seek
any
separate
interest
;
we
converse
seriously
and
gravely
,
and
upon
the
subject
of
our
repentance
continually
;
we
never
change
,
that
be
to
say
,
so
as
to
leave
off
our
armenian
garb
;
and
we
be
call
,
at
Venice
,
the
two
Grecians
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
two
or
three
time
go
to
give
a
detail
of
our
wealth
,
but
it
will
appear
incredible
,
and
we
have
the
great
difficulty
in
the
world
how
to
conceal
it
,
be
justly
apprehensive
lest
we
may
be
assassinate
in
that
country
for
our
treasure
.
<EOS>
at
length
William
tell
me
he
begin
to
think
now
that
he
must
never
see
England
any
more
,
and
that
indeed
he
do
not
much
concern
himself
about
it
;
but
see
we
have
gain
so
great
wealth
,
and
he
have
some
poor
relation
in
England
,
if
I
be
willing
,
he
would
write
to
know
if
they
be
live
,
and
to
know
what
condition
they
be
in
,
and
if
he
find
such
of
them
be
alive
as
he
have
some
thought
about
,
he
would
,
with
my
consent
,
send
them
something
to
better
their
condition
.
  
<EOS>
I
consent
most
willingly
;
and
accordingly
William
write
to
a
sister
and
an
uncle
,
and
in
about
five
week
'
time
receive
an
answer
from
them
both
,
direct
to
himself
,
under
cover
of
a
hard
armenian
name
that
he
have
give
himself
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
Signore
Constantine
Alexion
of
Ispahan
,
at
Venice
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
moving
letter
he
receive
from
his
sister
,
who
,
after
the
most
passionate
expression
of
joy
to
hear
he
be
alive
,
see
she
have
long
ago
have
an
account
that
he
be
murder
by
the
pirate
in
the
West
Indies
,
entreat
him
to
let
her
know
what
circumstance
he
be
in
;
tell
him
she
be
not
in
any
capacity
to
do
anything
considerable
for
him
,
but
that
he
should
be
welcome
to
her
with
all
her
heart
;
that
she
be
leave
a
widow
,
with
four
child
,
but
keep
a
little
shop
in
the
Minories
,
by
which
she
make
shift
to
maintain
her
family
;
and
that
she
have
send
him
five
pound
,
lest
he
should
want
money
,
in
a
strange
country
,
to
bring
him
home
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
letter
bring
tear
out
of
his
eye
as
he
read
it
;
and
,
indeed
,
when
he
show
it
to
me
,
and
the
little
bill
for
five
pound
,
upon
an
english
merchant
in
Venice
,
it
bring
tear
out
of
my
eye
too
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
be
both
affect
sufficiently
with
the
tenderness
and
kindness
of
this
letter
,
he
turn
to
me
;
say
he
,
"
what
shall
I
do
for
this
poor
woman
?
<EOS>
"
I
muse
a
while
;
at
last
say
I
,
"
I
will
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
send
you
five
pound
,
and
she
have
four
child
,
and
herself
,
that
be
five
;
such
a
sum
,
from
a
poor
woman
in
her
circumstance
,
be
as
much
as
five
thousand
pound
be
to
us
;
you
shall
send
her
a
bill
of
exchange
for
five
thousand
pound
english
money
,
and
bid
her
conceal
her
surprise
at
it
till
she
hear
from
you
again
;
but
bid
her
leave
off
her
shop
,
and
go
and
take
a
house
somewhere
in
the
country
,
not
far
off
from
London
,
and
stay
there
,
in
a
moderate
figure
,
till
she
hear
from
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
perceive
by
it
that
you
have
some
thought
of
venture
into
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
mistake
me
;
but
it
presently
occur
to
me
that
you
should
venture
,
for
what
have
you
do
that
you
may
not
be
see
there
?
<EOS>
why
should
I
desire
to
keep
you
from
your
relation
,
purely
to
keep
me
company
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
William
look
very
affectionately
upon
me
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
have
embark
together
so
long
,
and
come
together
so
far
,
I
be
resolve
I
will
never
part
with
thee
as
long
as
I
live
,
go
where
thou
wilt
,
or
stay
where
thou
wilt
;
and
as
for
my
sister
,
"
say
William
,
"
I
can
not
send
her
such
a
sum
of
money
,
for
whose
be
all
this
money
we
have
?
<EOS>
It
be
most
of
it
thine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
there
be
not
a
penny
of
it
mine
but
<EOS>
what
be
yours
too
,
and
I
will
not
have
anything
but
an
equal
share
with
you
,
and
therefore
you
shall
send
it
to
her
;
if
not
,
I
will
send
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
William
,
"
it
will
make
the
poor
woman
distract
;
she
will
be
so
surprised
she
will
go
out
of
her
wit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
William
,
you
may
do
it
prudently
;
send
her
a
bill
back
of
a
hundred
pound
,
and
bid
her
expect
more
in
a
post
or
two
,
and
that
you
will
send
her
enough
to
live
on
without
keep
shop
,
and
then
send
her
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
accordingly
William
send
her
a
very
kind
letter
,
with
a
bill
upon
a
merchant
in
London
for
a
hundred
and
sixty
pound
,
and
bid
her
comfort
herself
with
the
hope
that
he
should
be
able
in
a
little
time
to
send
her
more
.
<EOS>
about
ten
day
after
,
he
send
her
another
bill
of
five
hundred
and
forty
pound
;
and
a
post
or
two
after
,
another
for
three
hundred
pound
,
make
in
all
a
thousand
pound
;
and
tell
her
he
would
send
her
sufficient
to
leave
off
her
shop
,
and
direct
her
to
take
a
house
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
He
wait
then
till
he
receive
an
answer
to
all
the
three
letter
,
with
an
account
that
she
have
receive
the
money
,
and
,
which
I
do
not
expect
,
that
she
have
not
let
any
other
acquaintance
know
that
she
have
receive
a
shilling
from
anybody
,
or
so
much
as
that
he
be
alive
,
and
would
not
till
she
have
hear
again
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
show
me
this
letter
,
"
well
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
this
woman
be
fit
to
be
trust
with
life
or
anything
;
send
her
the
rest
of
the
five
thousand
pound
,
and
I
will
venture
to
England
with
you
,
to
this
woman
's
house
,
whenever
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
send
her
five
thousand
pound
in
good
bill
;
and
she
receive
them
very
punctually
,
and
in
a
little
time
send
her
brother
word
that
she
have
pretend
to
her
uncle
that
she
be
sickly
and
could
not
carry
on
the
trade
any
longer
,
and
that
she
have
take
a
large
house
about
four
mile
from
London
,
under
pretence
of
letting
lodging
for
her
livelihood
;
and
,
in
short
,
intimate
as
if
she
understand
that
he
intend
to
come
over
to
be
incognito
,
assure
him
he
should
be
as
retire
as
he
please
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
open
the
very
door
for
us
that
we
think
have
be
effectually
shut
for
this
life
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
we
resolve
to
venture
,
but
to
keep
ourselves
entirely
conceal
,
both
as
to
name
and
every
other
circumstance
;
and
accordingly
William
send
his
sister
word
<EOS>
how
kindly
he
take
her
prudent
step
,
and
that
she
have
guess
right
that
he
desire
to
be
retire
,
and
that
he
oblige
her
not
to
increase
her
figure
,
but
live
private
,
till
she
may
perhaps
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
send
the
letter
away
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
William
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
shall
not
send
her
an
empty
letter
;
tell
her
you
have
a
friend
come
with
you
that
must
be
as
retire
as
yourself
,
and
I
will
send
her
five
thousand
pound
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
in
short
,
we
make
this
poor
woman
's
family
rich
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
when
it
come
to
the
point
,
my
heart
fail
me
,
and
I
durst
not
venture
;
and
for
William
,
he
would
not
stir
without
me
;
and
so
we
stay
about
two
year
after
this
,
consider
what
we
should
do
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
think
,
perhaps
,
that
I
be
very
prodigal
of
my
ill
-
get
good
,
thus
to
load
a
stranger
with
my
bounty
,
and
give
a
gift
like
a
prince
to
one
that
have
be
able
to
merit
nothing
of
me
,
or
indeed
know
me
;
but
my
condition
ought
to
be
consider
in
this
case
;
though
I
have
money
to
profusion
,
yet
I
be
perfectly
destitute
of
a
friend
in
the
world
,
to
have
the
least
obligation
or
assistance
from
,
or
know
not
either
where
to
dispose
or
trust
anything
I
have
while
I
live
,
or
whom
to
give
it
to
if
I
die
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
reflect
upon
the
manner
of
my
get
of
it
,
I
be
sometimes
for
give
it
all
to
charitable
use
,
as
a
debt
due
to
mankind
,
though
I
be
no
Roman
Catholic
,
and
not
at
all
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
purchase
me
any
repose
to
my
soul
;
but
I
think
,
as
it
be
get
by
a
general
plunder
,
and
which
I
could
make
no
satisfaction
for
,
it
be
due
to
the
community
,
and
I
ought
to
distribute
it
for
the
general
good
.
<EOS>
but
still
I
be
at
a
loss
<EOS>
how
,
and
where
,
and
by
whom
to
settle
this
charity
,
not
daring
to
go
home
to
my
own
country
,
lest
some
of
my
comrade
,
stroll
home
,
should
see
and
detect
me
,
and
for
the
very
spoil
of
my
money
,
or
the
purchase
of
his
own
pardon
,
betray
and
expose
me
to
an
untimely
end
.
  
<EOS>
be
thus
destitute
,
I
say
,
of
a
friend
,
I
pitch
thus
upon
William
's
sister
;
the
kind
step
of
her
to
her
brother
,
whom
she
think
to
be
in
distress
,
signify
a
generous
mind
and
a
charitable
disposition
;
and
have
resolve
to
make
her
the
object
of
my
first
bounty
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
should
purchase
something
of
a
refuge
for
myself
,
and
a
kind
of
a
centre
,
to
which
I
should
tend
in
my
future
action
;
for
really
a
man
that
have
a
subsistence
,
and
no
residence
,
no
place
that
have
a
magnetic
influence
upon
his
affection
,
be
in
one
of
the
most
odd
,
uneasy
condition
in
the
world
,
nor
be
it
in
the
power
of
all
his
money
to
make
it
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
as
I
tell
you
,
two
year
and
upward
that
we
remain
at
Venice
and
thereabout
,
in
the
great
hesitation
imaginable
,
irresolute
and
unfixed
to
the
last
degree
.
<EOS>
William
's
sister
importune
us
daily
to
come
to
England
,
and
wonder
we
should
not
dare
to
trust
her
,
whom
we
have
to
such
a
degree
oblige
to
be
faithful
;
and
in
a
manner
lament
her
be
suspect
by
us
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
I
begin
to
incline
;
and
I
say
to
William
,
"
come
,
brother
William
,
"
say
I
(
for
ever
since
our
discourse
at
Bassorah
I
call
him
brother
)
,
"
if
you
will
agree
to
two
or
three
thing
with
me
,
I
will
go
home
to
England
with
all
my
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
say
William
,
"
let
me
know
what
they
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
first
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
shall
not
disclose
yourself
to
any
of
your
relation
in
England
but
your
sister
 
no
,
not
one
;
secondly
,
we
will
not
shave
off
our
mustachio
or
beard
"
<EOS>
(
for
we
have
all
along
wear
our
beard
after
the
grecian
manner
)
,
"
nor
leave
off
our
long
vest
,
that
we
may
pass
for
grecian
and
foreigner
;
thirdly
,
that
we
shall
never
speak
English
in
public
before
anybody
,
your
sister
except
;
fourthly
,
that
we
will
always
live
together
and
pass
for
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
William
say
he
would
agree
to
them
all
with
all
his
heart
,
but
that
the
not
speak
English
would
be
the
hard
,
but
he
would
do
his
good
for
that
too
;
so
,
in
a
word
,
we
agree
to
go
from
Venice
to
Naples
,
where
we
convert
a
large
sum
of
money
into
bale
of
silk
,
leave
a
large
sum
in
a
merchant
's
hand
at
Venice
,
and
another
considerable
sum
at
Naples
,
and
take
bill
of
exchange
for
a
great
deal
too
;
and
yet
we
come
with
such
a
cargo
to
London
as
few
american
merchant
have
do
for
some
year
,
for
we
load
in
two
ship
seventy
-
three
bale
of
throw
silk
,
besides
thirteen
bale
of
wrought
silk
,
from
the
duchy
of
Milan
,
ship
at
Genoa
,
with
all
which
I
arrive
safely
;
and
some
time
after
I
marry
my
faithful
protectress
,
William
's
sister
,
with
whom
I
be
much
more
happy
than
I
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
have
so
plainly
tell
you
that
I
be
come
to
England
,
after
I
have
so
boldly
own
what
life
I
have
lead
abroad
,
it
be
time
to
leave
off
,
and
say
no
more
for
the
present
,
lest
some
should
be
willing
to
inquire
too
nicely
after
your
old
friend
CAPTAIN
BOB
.
