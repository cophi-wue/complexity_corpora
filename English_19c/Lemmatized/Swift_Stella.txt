LONDON

1710
.
  
<EOS>
Got
here
last
Thursday
,
after
five
day
'
travelling
,
weary
the
first
,
almost
dead
the
second
,
tolerable
the
third
,
and
well
enough
the
rest
;
and
be
now
glad
of
the
fatigue
,
which
have
serve
for
exercise
;
and
I
be
at
present
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
be
ravish
to
see
me
,
and
would
lay
hold
on
me
as
a
twig
while
they
be
drown
,
and
the
great
man
make
me
their
clumsy
apology
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
Lord
Treasurer
receive
me
with
a
great
deal
of
coldness
,
which
have
enrage
me
so
,
I
be
almost
vow
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
go
half
my
circle
;
but
I
find
all
my
acquaintance
just
as
I
leave
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
my
Lady
Giffard
be
much
at
court
,
and
Lady
Wharton
be
ridicule
it
t'other
day
;
so
I
have
lose
a
friend
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
see
her
,
nor
intend
it
;
but
I
will
contrive
to
see
Stella
's
mother
some
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
from
Chester
;
and
I
now
write
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
be
turn
upside
down
;
every
Whig
in
great
office
will
,
to
a
man
,
be
infallibly
put
out
;
and
we
shall
have
such
a
winter
as
hath
not
be
see
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
ask
me
,
how
I
come
to
be
so
long
in
Ireland
,
as
naturally
as
if
here
be
my
being
;
but
no
soul
offer
to
make
it
so
:
 
and
I
protest
I
shall
return
to
Dublin
,
and
the
Canal
at
Laracor
,
with
more
satisfaction
than
ever
I
do
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
Tatler
expect
every
day
to
be
turn
out
of
his
employment
;
and
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
they
say
,
will
be
Lieutenant
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
now
peaceably
in
Presto
's
lodging
;
but
I
resolve
to
turn
you
out
by
Christmas
;
in
which
time
I
shall
either
do
my
business
,
or
find
it
not
to
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
Pray

the
time
this
letter
come
to
you
;
and
ride

,
on
the
post
-
night
,
and
have
already
write
to
the

;
and

not
lengthen
this
.
 
<EOS>
henceforth
I

write
something
every

,
and
make
it
a
sort
of
journal
;
and
when

full
,
I
will
send

whether

and
so
that

be
pretty
:
 
and
I
shall
always

conversation
with
MD
,
and
MD

Presto
.
<EOS>

immediately
;
so
I
order
him
.

,
and
look
better
;
and

<EOS>
I
think

Jack
Temple
and
his
wife

by
me
to

day
in
their
coach
;
but
I
take
no

.
 
<EOS>
I

family
.
 
<EOS>
tell
the
Provost

or
let
it
alone

and
to

night
,
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
we
hear
Sir
Simon
Harcourt
be
make
Lord
Keeper
;
so
that
now
we
expect
every
moment
the
Parliament
will
be
dissolve
;
but
I
forget
that
this
letter
will
not
go
in
three
or
four
day
,
and
that
my

will
be
stale
,
which
I
should
therefore
put
in
the
last
paragraph
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
this

before
I
hear

,
to

<EOS>
yesterday

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
We

We

<EOS>
here

I
begin
another

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

and
contrive
to

and

<EOS>
We

nothing

me
but
that
it
do
not
make
Stella

coward
in

<EOS>
I
do

twopence

however
I
will
,
in
compliance
to
you

ask

<EOS>
Radcliffe

<EOS>
so
Stella
pun
again
;
why
,
'
tis
well
enough
;
but
I
will
not
second
it
,
though
I
could
make
a
dozen
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
think
of
a
pun
since
I
leave
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
Bishop
of
Clogher
's
bill
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
he
pay
it
to
me
;
do
you
think
I

such
a

<EOS>
as
for
the

shilling
,
I
will
give

and
Joe

or
let

have
my
hand
for
.
 
<EOS>
no

no
,
I
will
eat
no
grape
;
I
eat
about
six
the
other
day
at
Sir

Holland

but
would
not
give
sixpence
for
a
thousand
,
they
be
so
bad
this
year
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
faith
,
I
hope
in
God
Presto
and
MD
will
be
together
this
time
twelvemonth
.
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
last
year
I
suppose
I
be
at
Laracor
;
but
next
I
hope
to
eat
my
Michaelmas
goose
at
my
two
little
goose
"
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
I
drink
no
aile
<EOS>

I
suppose

ale
)
;
but
yet
good
wine
every

,
of
five
and
six
shilling

<EOS>
o
Lord

how
much
Stella

<EOS>
pray
do
not
carry
that
too
far
,
young
woman
,
but
be
temperate
,
to
hold
out
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
go
to
Mr.
Harley
.
<EOS>
why
,
small
hope
from
the
Duke
of
Ormond
:
 
<EOS>
he
love
me
very
well
,
I
believe
,
and
would
,
in
my
turn
,
give
me
something
to
make
me
easy
;
and
I
have
good
interest
among
his
good
friend
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
of
anything
further
than
the
business
I
be
upon
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
writ
to
Manley
before
I
have
your
letter
,
and
I
fear
he
will
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Mrs.
Owl
,
Bligh
's
corpse
come
to
Chester
when
I
be
there
;
and
I
tell
you
so
in
my
letter
,
or
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
lodge
in
Bury
Street
,
where
I
remove
a
week
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
first
floor
,
a
dining
-
room
,
and
bed
-
chamber
,
at
eight
shilling
a
week
;
<EOS>
plaguy
deep
,
but
I
spend
nothing
for
eat
,
never
go
to
a
tavern
,
and
very
seldom
in
a
coach
;
yet
after
all
it
will
be
expensive
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
trouble
yourself
,
Mistress
Stella
,
about
my
instrument
?
<EOS>
I
have
the
same
the
Archbishop
give
me
;
and
it
be
as
good
<EOS>
now
the
bishop
be
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dean
friendly
!
<EOS>
the
Dean
be
poxe
:
 
a
great
piece
of
friendship
indeed
,
what
you
hear
him
tell
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
<EOS>
;
I
wonder
he
have
the
face
to
talk
so
:
 
but
he
lend
me
money
,
and
that
be
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
would
not
send
this
these
four
day
,
only
for
write
to
Joe
and
Parvisol
.
 
<EOS>
tell
the
dean
that
when
the
bishop
send
me
any
packet
,
they
must
not
write
to
me
at
Mr.
Steele
's
;
but
direct
for
Mr.
Steele
,
at
his
office
at
the
Cockpit
,
and
let
the
enclose
be
direct
for
me
:
 
that
mistake
cost
me
eighteenpence
the
other
day
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Stratford
to

day
,
but
be
not

Wednesday
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
late
,
and
I
send
this
before
there
be
occasion
for
the
bell
;
because
I
would
have
Joe
have
his
letter
,
and
Parvisol
too
;
<EOS>
which
you
must
so
contrive
as
not
to
cost
them
double
postage
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
say
no
more

but
that
I

stay
all
day
,
and
return
so
quickly
:
 
<EOS>
you
can
not
do
anything
like
this
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
I
writ
a
second
penny
post
letter
to
your
mother
,
and
hear
nothing
of
her

<EOS>
do
I

at
Berkeley
Castle

of

<EOS>
Lord
Halifax
begin
a
health
to
me
to
-
day
;
it
be
the
Resurrection
of
the
Whigs
,
which
I
refuse
unless
he
would
add
their
Reformation
too
and
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
be
the
only
Whig
in
England
I
love
,
or
have
any
good
opinion
of
.

<EOS>
this
morning
Stella

to
me
with
a
letter
from
her
mother
,
who
be
at
sheen
;
but
will
soon
be
in
town
,
and
will
call
to
see
me
:
 
<EOS>
she
give
me
a
bottle
of
palsy
water
,
a
small
one
,
and
desire
I
would
send
it
you
by
the
first
convenience
,
as
I
will
;
and
she
promise
a
quart
bottle
of
the
same
:
 
<EOS>
your
sister
look
very
well
,
and
seem
a
good
modest
sort
of
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
then
to
Mr.
Lewis
,
first
secretary
to
Lord
Dartmouth
,
and
favourite
to
Mr.
Harley
,
who
be
to
introduce
me
to

morning
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
have
with

one
Mr.

,
a
Justice
of
Peace
,
worth
twenty
thousand
pound
,
a
Commissioner
of
the
Stamp
Office
,
and
marry
to
a
sister
of
Sir
Philip
Meadows
,
Envoy
to
the
Emperor
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
,
because
it
be
odd
but
this
Mr.
Dyot
will
be
hang
;
for
he
be
discover
to
have
counterfeit
stamped
paper
,
in
which
he
be
a
Commissioner
;
and
,
with
his
accomplice
,
have
cheat
the
Queen
of
a
hundred
thousand
pound
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
hear
of
it
before
this
come
to
you
,
but
may
be
not
so
particularly
;
and
it
be
a
very
odd
accident
in
such
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
Smoke
Presto
writing
news
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to

day
with
Lord
Mountjoy
at
Kensington
,
and
walk
from
thence
this
evening
to
town
like
an
emperor
.
 
<EOS>
remember
that
yesterday
,
October
2
,
be
a
cruel
hard
frost
,
with
ice
;
and
six
day
ago
I
be
die
with
heat
.
 
<EOS>
as
thin
as
the
town
be
,
I
have
more
dinner
than
ever
;
and
be
ask
this
month
by
some
people
,
without
be
able
to
come
for
pre
-
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
I
should
write
plainer
,
when
I
consider
Stella
can
not
read
,
and
Dingley
be
not
so
skilful
at
my
ugly
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tonight
<EOS>
a
letter
from
Mr.
Pratt
,
who
tell
me
Joe

have
his

and
whenever
those

appoint
,
I
will
solicit
whoever
be
Lord
Lieutenant
,
and
be
in
no
fear
of
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
so
pray
tell
or
write
him
word
,
and
bid
him
not
be
cast
down
;
for
Ned
Southwell
and
Mr.
Addison
both
think
pratt
in
the

<EOS>
do
not
lose
your
money
at
Manley

to

,
sirrah

<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
after
I
have
put
out
my
candle
last
night
,
my
landlady
come
into
my
room
,
with
a
servant
of
Lord
Halifax
,
to
desire
I
would
go
dine
with
him
at
his
house
near
Hampton
Court
;
but
I
send
him
word
,
I
have
business
of
great
importance
that
hinder
me
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
-
day
I
be
bring
privately
to
Mr.
Harley
,
who
receive
me
with
the
great
respect
and
kindness
imaginable
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
appoint
me
an
hour
on
Saturday
at
four
,
afternoon
,
when
I
will
open
my
business
to
him
;
which
expression
I
would
not
use
if
I
be
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
smoke
it
;
but
<EOS>
I
do
not
till
I
writ
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
at
Mr.
Delaval
's
,
the
Envoy
for
Portugal
,
with
Nic
Rowe
the
poet
,
and
other
friend
;
and
I
give
my
lampoon
to
be
print
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
more
mischief
in
my
heart
;
and
I
think
it
shall
go
round
with
them
all
,
as
this
hit
,
and
I
can
find
hint
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
certain
<EOS>
I
answer
your
2d
letter
,
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
not
find
it
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
in
my
4th
:
 
and
why
N.
2d
,
3d
;
be
it
not
enough
to
say
,
as
I
do
,
1
,
2
,
3
?
<EOS>
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
work
at
another
tatler
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
far
enough
<EOS>
but
I
say
the
same
thing
over
two
or
three
time
,
just
as
I
do
when
I
be
talk
to
little
MD
;
but
what
care
I
?
<EOS>
they
can
read
it
as
easily
as
I
can
write
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
bring
these
line
pretty
straight
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
it
will
be
long
before
I
finish
two
side
at
this
rate
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
dear
MD
,
when
I
occasionally
give
you
any
little
commission
mix
with
my
letter
,
do
not
forget
it
,
as
that
to
Morgan
and
Joe
,
etc
.
,
for
I
write
just
as
I
can
remember
,
otherwise
I
would
put
them
all
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
visit
Mr.
Sterne
to
-
day
,
and
give
him
your
commission
about
handkerchiefs
:
 
that
of
chocolate
<EOS>
I
will
do
myself
,
and
send
it
him
when
he
go
,
and
you
will
pay
me
when
the
GIVER

etc
.
 
<EOS>
to

I
will
read

to
amuse
myself
.
<EOS>
God
preserve
your

.
 
<EOS>
this
morning
Delaval
come
to
see
me
,
and
we
go
together
to
Kneller
's
,
who
be
not
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
way
we
meet
the
elector
for
Parliament
-
man
:
 
and
the
rabble
come
about
our
coach
,
cry
,
"
a
Colt
,
a
Stanhope
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
afraid
of
a
dead
cat
,
or
our
glass
break
,
and
so
be
always
of
their
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
again
at
Delaval
's
;
and
in
the
evening
,
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
hear
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
be
come
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
this
have
be
but
an
insipid
sort
of
day
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
remark
upon
it
worth
threepence
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
MD
have
a
well
,
with
the
Dean
,
the
Bishop
,
or
Mrs.
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
the
reason
you
lose
four
and
eightpence
last
night
but
one
at
Manley
's
be
,
because
you
play
bad
game
:
 
<EOS>
I
take
notice
of
six
that
you
have
ten
to
one
against
you
:
 
Would
any
but
a
mad
lady
go
out
twice
upon
Manilio
;
Basto
,
and
two
small
diamond
?
<EOS>
then
in
that
game
of
spade
,
you
blunder
when
you
have
ten
-
ace
;
I
never
see
the
like
of
you
:
 
<EOS>
and
now
you
be
in
a
huff
because
I
tell
you
this
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
here
be
two
and
eightpence
halfpenny
towards
your
loss
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
come
this
morning
,
and
catch
me
write
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
city
with
him
;
and
we
dine
at
the
Chop
-
house
with
Will
Pate
,
the
learn
woollen
-
draper
:
 
<EOS>
then
we
saunter
at
China
-
shop
and
bookseller
;
go
to
the
tavern
,
drink
two
pint
of
white
wine
,
and
never
part
till
ten
:
 
and
now
I
be
come
home
,
and
must
copy
out
some
paper
I
intend
for
Mr.
Harley
,
whom
I
be
to
see
,
as
I
tell
you
,
to
-
morrow
afternoon
;
so
that
this
night
I
shall
say
little
to
MD
,
but
that
I
heartily
wish
myself
with
them
,
and
will
come
as
soon
as
I
either
fail
,
or
compass
my
business
.
 
<EOS>
We
now
hear
daily
of
election
;
and
,
in
a
list
I
see
yesterday
of
about
twenty
,
there
be
seven
or
eight
more
Tories
than
in
the
last
Parliament
;
so
that
I
believe
they
nee
not
fear
a
majority
,
with
the
help
of
those
who
will
vote
as
the
Court
please
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
tell
that
Mr.
Harley
himself
would
not
let
the
Tories
be
too
numerous
,
for
fear
they
should
be
insolent
,
and
kick
against
him
;
and
for
that
reason
they
have
keep
several
Whigs
in
employment
,
who
expect
to
be
turn
out
every
day
;
as
Sir
John
Holland
the
Comptroller
,
and
many
other
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
get
you
go
to
your
card
,
and
your
claret
and
orange
,
at
the
Dean
's
;
and
I
will
go
write
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
when
this
letter
will
be
finish
:
 
it
must
go
by
Tuesday
<EOS>
,
that
be
certain
;
and
if
I
have
one
from
MD
before
,
I
will
not
answer
it
<EOS>
,
that
be
as
certain
too
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
now
morning
,
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
finish
my
paper
for
Mr.
Harley
last
night
;
for
you
must
understand
Presto
be
sleepy
,
and
make
blunder
and
blot
.
 
<EOS>
very
pretty
that
I
must
be
write
to
young
woman
in
a
morning
fresh
and
fasting
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
good
-
morrow
to
you
;
<EOS>
and
so
I
go
to
business
,
and
lie
aside
this
paper
till
night
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
<EOS>
how
tell
Harley
that
if
there
be
a
low
place
in
hell
than
another
,
it
be
reserve
for
his
porter
,
who
tell
lie
so
gravely
,
and
with
so
civil
a
manner
.
 
<EOS>
this
porter
I
have
have
to
deal
with
,
go
this
evening
at
four
to
visit
Mr.
Harley
,
by
his
own
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
fellow
tell
me
no
lie
,
though
I
suspect
every
word
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
his
master
be
just
go
to
dinner
,
with
much
company
,
and
desire
I
would
come
an
hour
hence
:
 
which
I
do
,
expect
to
hear
Mr.
Harley
be
go
out
;
but
they
have
just
do
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
come
out
to
me
,
bring
me
in
,
and
present
to
me
his
son
-
in
-
law
Lord
Doblane
(
or
some
such
name
)
and
his
own
son
,
and
,
among
other
,
Will
Penn
the
Quaker
:
 
we
sit
two
hour
drink
as
good
wine
as
you
do
;
and
two
hour
more
<EOS>
he
and
I
alone
<EOS>
;
where
he
hear
me
tell
my
business
;
enter
into
it
with
all
kindness
;
ask
for
my
power
,
and
read
them
;
and
read
likewise
a
memorial
I
have
draw
up
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
to
show
the
Queen
;
tell
me
the
measure
he
would
take
;
and
,
in
short
,
say
everything
I
could
wish
:
 
tell
me
,
he
must
bring
Mr.
St.
John
(
Secretary
of
State
)
and
me
acquaint
;
and
speak
so
many
thing
of
personal
kindness
and
esteem
for
me
,
that
I
be
incline
half
to
believe
what
some
friend
have
tell
me
,
that
he
would
do
everything
to
bring
me
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
desire
to
dine
with
me
<EOS>
(
what
a
comical
mistake
be
that
!
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
he
have
desire
me
to
dine
with
him
on
Tuesday
;
and
after
four
hour
be
with
him
,
set
me
down
at
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
in
a
hackney
-
coach
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
odd
and
comical
,
if
you
consider
him
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
my
christian
name
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
say
thus
much
upon
this
matter
,
although
you
will
think
it
tedious
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
;
you
must
know
,
'
tis
fatal
to
me
to
be
a
scoundrel
and
a
prince
the
same
day
:
 
for
,
be
to
see
him
at
four
,
I
could
not
engage
myself
to
dine
at
any
friend
be
;
so
I
go
to
Tooke
,
to
give
him
a
ballad
,
and
dine
with
him
;
but
he
be
not
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
force
to
go
to
a
blind
chop
-
house
,
and
dine
for
tenpence
upon
gill
-
ale
,
bad
broth
,
and
three
chop
of
mutton
;
and
then
go
reek
from
thence
to
the
First
Minister
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
go
in
charity
to
send
Steele
a
tatler
,
who
be
very
low
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
civiller
than
I
use
to
be
;
and
have
not
use
the
expression
of
"
you
in
Ireland
"
and
"
we
in
England
"
as
I
do
when
I
be
here
before
,
to
your
great
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
talk
of
the
<EOS>
you
know
what
;
<EOS>
but
,
gad
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
that
,
I
should
never
have
be
able
to
get
the
access
I
have
have
;
and
if
that
help
me
to
succeed
,
then
that
same
thing
will
be
serviceable
to
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
far
we
must
depend
upon
new
friend
,
I
have
learn
by
long
practice
,
though
I
think
among
great
Ministers
,
they
be
just
as
good
as
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
think
this
important
day
have
make
a
great
hole
in
this
side
of
the
paper
;
and
the
fiddle
-
faddle
of
tomorrow
and
Monday
will
make
up
the
rest
;
and
,
besides
,
I
shall
see
Harley
on
Tuesday
before
this
letter
go
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
a
great
piece
of
refinement
of
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
He
charge
me
to
come
to
him
often
:
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
loth
to
trouble
him
in
so
much
business
as
he
have
,
and
desire
I
may
have
leave
to
come
at
his
levee
;
which
he
immediately
refuse
,
and
say
,
that
be
not
a
place
for
friend
to
come
to
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
now
but
morning
;
and
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
foolish
trick
,
I
must
say
something
to

for

but
get

,
I
must
go
write
:
<EOS>
yes
,
'
twill
vex
me
to
the
blood
if
any
of
these
long
letter
should
miscarry
:
 
<EOS>
if
they
do
,
I
will
shrink
to
half
-
sheet
again
;
but
then
what
will
you
do
to
make
up
the
journal
?
<EOS>
there
will
be
ten
day
of
Presto
's
life
lose
;
and
that
will
be
a
sad
thing
,
faith
and
troth
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
at
a
loss
today
for
a
dinner
,
unless
I
would
have
go
a
great
way
,
<EOS>
so
I
dine
with
some
friend
that
board
hereabout
,
as
a
spunger
;
and
this
evening
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
would
need
have
me
go
to
the
tavern
;
<EOS>
where
,
for
two
bottle
of
wine
,
Portugal
and
Florence

among
three
of
us

we
have
sixteen
shilling
to
pay
;
but
if
ever
he
catch
me
so
again
,
I
will
spend
as
many
pound
:
 
<EOS>
and
therefore

and
I

<EOS>
I
hope
this
letter
will
go

I
have
MD

<EOS>
do
you
believe
me
?
<EOS>
and

I
be
not

<EOS>
I

but
now

be
all
out
of
town
at

but
I

because
of

for
I
be
go
now
to

an

Methinks

LETTER

.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
October
10
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
as
I
tell
you
just
now
in
the
letter
I
send
half
an
hour
ago
,
I
dine
with
Mr.
Harley
to
-
day
,
who
present
me
to
the
Attorney
-
General
,
Sir
Simon
Harcourt
,
with
much
compliment
on
all
side
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Harley
tell
me
he
have
show
my
memorial
to
the
Queen
,
and
second
it
very
heartily
;
and
he
desire
me
to
dine
with
him
again
on
Sunday
,
when
he
promise
to
settle
it
with
Her
Majesty
,
before
she
name
a
Governor
:
and
I
protest
I
be
in
hope
it
will
be
do
,
<EOS>
all
but
the
form
,
by
that
time
;
for
he
love
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
popular
thing
,
and
he
would
not
have
a
Governor
share
in
it
;
and
,
besides
,
I
be
tell
by
all
hand
,
he
have
a
mind
to
gain
me
over
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
letter
I
writ
last
post
(
yesterday
)
<EOS>
to
the
Archbishop
,
I
do
not
tell
him
a
syllable
of
what
Mr.
Harley
say
to
me
last
night
,
because
he
charge
me
to
keep
it
secret
;
so
I
would
not
tell
it
to
you
,
but
that
,
before
this
go
,
I
hope
the
secret
will
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
now
write
my
poetical
"
description
of
a
Shower
in
London
,
"
and
will
send
it
to
the
Tatler
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
sheet
of
a
whole
quire
I
have
write
since
I
come
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
now
it
come
into
my
head
,
will
you
,
when
you
go
to
Mrs.
Walls
,
contrive
to
know
whether
Mrs.
Wesley
be
in
town
,
and
still
at
her
brother
's
,
and
how
she
be
in
health
,
and
whether
she
stay
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
her
from
Chester
,
to
know
what
I
should
do
with
her
note
;
and
I
believe
the
poor
woman
be
afraid
to
write
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
must
go
to
my
business
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
day
at
last
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Mountrath
,
and
carry
Lord
Mountjoy
,
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
with
me
;
and
be
look
over
them
at
ombre
till
eleven
this
evening
like
a
fool
:
 
<EOS>
they
play
run
ombre
half
-
crown
;
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
win
eight
guinea
of
Mr.
Coote
;
so
I
be
come
home
late
,
and
will
say
but
little
to
MD
this
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
half
a
bushel
of
coal
,
and
Patrick
,
the
extravagant
whelp
,
have
a
fire
ready
for
me
;
but
I
pick
off
the
coal
before
I
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sign
London
be
now
an
empty
place
,
when
it
will
not
furnish
me
with
matter
for
above
five
or
six
line
in
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
smoke
in
my
last
how
I
tell
you
the
very
day
and
the
place
you
be
play
at
ombre
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
interline
and
alter
a
little
,
after
I
have
receive
a
letter
from
Mr.
Manley
<EOS>
,
that
say
you
be
at
it
in
his
house
,
while
he
be
write
to

;
but
without
his
help
I
guess
within
one
day
.
 
<EOS>
Your
town

certainly
much
more
sociable
than
our

<EOS>
I
have
not

else
I

,
only
inquire
every
day
after
new
election
,
where
the
Tories

among
the
new
member
six
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
's
election
have
pass
easy
and
undisputed
;
and
I
believe
if
he
have
a
mind
to
be
choose
king
,
he
would
hardly
be
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
an
odd
accident

of
doctor

whose
trade

<EOS>
Lavallin

upon

he
go
down
in
a

shoot
his

,
then
fall

;
and
,
to
make
the
matter
sure
,
at
the
same
time
discharge
a
pistol
through
his
own
head
,
and
die
on
the
spot
,
his

about
two
hour

but
in
what
circumstance
of
mind
and
body

terrible
to
imagine

one

,
I
have

<EOS>
but
I

I
dream

,
so
confusedly
last

:
 
<EOS>
and
she
bid
me
call

and
they
prove
to
be
two
parson
<EOS>
I

;
and
I
walk
without

she
be
shift
,
and
such
stuff
,
mix
with
much
melancholy
and
uneasiness
,
and
thing
not
as
they
should
be
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
:
 
and
it
be
now
an
ugly
gloomy
morning
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
dine
with
Ned
Southwell
,
and
walk
in
the
Park
;
and
at
the
Coffee
-
house
I
find
a
letter
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
and
a
packet
from
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
open
the
Bishop
's
letter
;
but
put
up
MD
's
,
and
visit
a
lady
just
come
to
town
;
and
be
now
get
into
bed
,
and
go
to
open
your
little
letter
:
 
and
God
send
<EOS>
I
may
find
MD
well
,
and
happy
,
and
merry
,
and
that
they
love
Presto
as
they
do
fire
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
I
will
not
open
it
yet
!
<EOS>
yes
I
will
!
<EOS>

I
will
not

<EOS>
I
be
go

I
can
not
stay
till
I
turn

<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
My
finger
itch
;
and
now
I
have
it
in
my
left
hand
;
and
now
I
will
open
it
this
very
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
get
it
,
and
be
crack
the
seal
,
and
can
not
imagine
what
be
in
it
;
I
fear
only
some
letter
from
a
bishop
,
and
it
come
too
late
;
I
shall
employ
nobody
's
credit
but
my

<EOS>
Pshaw

Mrs.
Barton
;
she
tell
me
she
would

to

;
but
she
write
a
well
hand
than
this
:
 
I
wish
you
would
inquire
;
it
must
be
at
Dawson
's
office
at
the
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
this
be
from
Patty
Rolt
,
by
the
scrawl
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
read
MD
's
letter
.
 
<EOS>
ah

be
from
poor
Lady
Berkeley
,
to
invite
me

Berkeley
Castle

winter
;
and
now
it
grieve
my
heart
:
 
<EOS>
she
say
,
she
hope
my
lord
be
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
;
poor
lady
!
<EOS>
well
,
now
I
go
to
MD
's
letter
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
it
be
all
right
;
I
hope
it
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Your
letter
,
N.3
,
that
I
have
now

,
be
date
September

;
and
Manley

that
I
have
five
day
ago
,
be

October
3
,
that
be
a
fortnight
difference
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it

lain
in
Steele
's
office
,
and
he
forget
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
an
end
of

<EOS>

;
and
you

desire
those

,
to

them
in
a

direct
to
Mr.
Addison
,
at
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
:
 
not

,
but

but

I
will
look

<EOS>
,
I
think

a
chasm
between

and
N.3
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
will
not
promise

that

be
once
in

day
,
and
that

be
often
enough
:
 
and
if
you
begin
to
take
up
the
way
of
writing
to
Presto
,
only
because
it
be
Tuesday
,
a
Monday
bedad
it
will
grow
a
task
;
but
write
when
you
have
a
mind
.

<EOS>

<EOS>
have
not
I
order
Parvisol
to
obey
your
direction
about

?
 
<EOS>
and
han't
<EOS>
I
say
in
my
former
letter
that
you
may
pickle
him
,
and
boil
him
,
if
you
will
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
trouble
me
about
your
horse
for
?
 
<EOS>
have
I
anything
to
do
with
them
?
 
<EOS>
revolution
a

to
me
in

<EOS>
revolution
to
me
in
my
business
?
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
for
the
revolution
,
I
could
do
nothing
at
all
;
and
now
I
have
all
hope
possible
,
though
one
be
certain
of
nothing
;
but
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
be
to
have
an
answer
,
and
be
promise
an
effectual
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
say
enough
in
this
and
a
former
letter
how
I
stand
with
new
people
;
ten
time
well
than
ever
I
do
with
the
old
;
forty
time
more
caressed
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
dine
to
-
morrow
at
Mr.
Harley
's
;
and
if
he
continue
as
he
have
begin
,
no
man
have
be
ever
better
treat
by
another
.
 
<EOS>
what
you
say
about
Stella
's
mother
,
I
have
speak
enough
to
it
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
she
be
not
in
town
;
for
I
have
not
yet
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
lampoon
be
cry
up
to
the
sky
;
but
nobody
suspect
me
for
it
,
except
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
:
 
at
least
they
say
nothing
of
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
I
tell
you
of
a
great
man
who
receive
me
very
coldly
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
he
;
but
say
nothing
;
'
<EOS>
twas
only
a
little
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
remember
to
bring
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
have
smoke
my
tatler
,
about
shorten
of
word
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
God
so
!
etc
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
plainer
if
I
can
remember
it
;
for
Stella
must
not
spoil
her
eye
,
and
Dingley
can
not
read
my
hand
very
well
;
and
I
be
afraid
my
letter
be
too
long
:
 
<EOS>
then
you
must
suppose
one
to
be
two
,
and
read
them
at
twice
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Harley
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Prior

with
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
leave
my
memorial
with
the
Queen
,
who
have
consent
to
give
the
First
-
Fruits
and
Twentieth
Parts
,
and
will
,
we
hope
,
declare
it
to
-
morrow
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
but
I
beg
you
to
tell
it
to
no
person
alive
;
for
so
I
be
order
,
till
in
public
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
to
get
something
of
great
value
.
 
<EOS>
after
dinner
come
in
Lord
Peterborow
:
 
<EOS>
we
renew
our
acquaintance
,
and
he
grow
mightily
fond
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
begin
to
talk
of
a
paper
of
verse
call
"
Sid
Hamet
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
repeat
part
,
and
then
pull
them
out
,
and
give
them
to
a
gentleman
at
the
table
to
read
,
though
they
have
all
read
them
often
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Peterborow
would
let
nobody
read
them
but
himself
:
 
<EOS>
so
he
do
;
and
Mr.
Harley
bob
me
at
every
line
,
to
take
notice
of
the
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
prior
rally
Lord
Peterborow
for
author
of
them
;
and
Lord
Peterborow
say
he
know
them
to
be
his
;
and
prior
then
turn
it
upon
me
,
and
I
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
guess
at
all
in
town
to
be
the
author
;
yet
so
it
be
:
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
a
secret
only
to
you
.
<EOS>
ten
to
one
whether
you
see
them
in
Ireland
;
yet
here
they
run
prodigiously
.
<EOS>
Harley
present
me
to
Lord
President
of
Scotland
,
and
Mr.
Benson
,
Lord
of
the
Treasury
.
 
<EOS>
prior
<EOS>
and
I
come
away
at
nine
,
and
sit
at
the
Smyrna
till
eleven
,
receive
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
this
morning
early
I
go
in
a
chair
,
and
Patrick
before
it
,
to
Mr.
Harley
,
to
give
him
another
copy
of
my
memorial
,
as
he
desire
;
but
he
be
full
of
business
,
go
to
the
Queen
,
and
I
could
not
see
him
;
but
he
desire
I
would
send
up
the
paper
,
and
excuse
himself
upon
his
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
baulked
;
but
they
tell
me
it
be
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
judge
by
next
visit
.
 
<EOS>
I
tip
his
porter
with
half
a
crown
;
and
so
I
be
well
there
for
a
time
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
at
Stratford
's
in
the
city
,
and
have
Burgundy
and
Tokay
:
 
come
back
afoot
like
a
scoundrel
:
 
<EOS>
then
go
with
Mr.
Addison
and
sup
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
which
make
me
sick
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
that
I

six
pound
of
chocolate
for
Stella
,
and

and
I

all
which
,
with

will
be
put
in
the

,
direct
to
Mrs.
Curry

and
send
by
Dr.
Hawkshaw
,
whom
I
have
not
see
;
but
Sterne
have
undertake
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
chocolate
be
a
present
,
madam
,
for
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
read
this
,
you
little
rogue
,
with
your
little
eye
;
but
give
it
to
Dingley

;
and
I
will

and
Stella

to
her
,
when

her
eye

<EOS>
I

Lady
Mary

Lord

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I
spend
the
evening
with
Wortley
Montagu
and
Mr.
Addison
,
over
a
bottle
of
irish
wine
.
 
<EOS>
do
they
know
anything
in
Ireland
of
my
greatness
among
the
Tories
?
 
<EOS>
everybody

but
I
value

not
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
hear
of
the
verse
about
the
"
Rod
of
Sid
Hamet
"
?
 
<EOS>
say
nothing

.
 
<EOS>
hardly
anybody
suspect

for
them
;
only
they
think
nobody
but
prior
or
I
could
write

.
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
they
have
not

<EOS>
there
be
likewise
a
ballad
full
of
pun
on
the
Westminster
Election
,
that
cost

half
an
hour
:
 
<EOS>

run
,
though

<EOS>
I
get

.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty

and
head

<EOS>
what
shall
we

<EOS>
Your

<EOS>
Would

Heaven
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
either
here
or

!
<EOS>
pray
do
not
write
,
nor
read
this
letter
,
nor
anything
else
;
and
I
will
write
plainer
for
Dingley
to
read
from
henceforward
,
though
my
pen
be
apt
to
ramble
when
I
think
whom
I
be
write
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
until
I
tell
you
that
I
dine
this
day
with
Mr.
Harley
,
who
present
me
to
the
Earl
of
Stirling
,
a
Scotch
lord
;
and
in
the
evening
come
in
Lord
Peterborow
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
till
nine
before
Mr.
Harley
would
let
me
go
,
or
tell
me
anything
of
my
affair
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
the
Queen
have
now
grant
the
First
-
Fruits
and
Twentieth
Parts
;
but
he
will
not
give
me
leave
to
write
to
the
Archbishop
,
because
the
Queen
design
to
signify
it
to
the
Bishops
in
Ireland
in
form
;
and
to
take
notice
,
that
it
be
do
upon
a
memorial
from
me
;
which
,
Mr.
Harley
tell
me
he
do
to
make
it
look
more
respectful
to
me
,
etc
.
;
and
I
be
to
see
him
on
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
I
tell
you
that
,
in
my
memorial
which
be
give
to
the
Queen
,
I
beg
for
two
thousand
pound
a
year
more
,
though
it
be
not
in
my
commission
;
but
that
,
Mr.
Harley
say
,
can
not
yet
be
do
,
and
that
he
and
I
must
talk
of
it
further
:
 
however
,
I
have
start
it
,
and
it
may
follow
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
say
nothing
of
the
first
-
fruit
be
grant
,
unless
I
give
leave
at
the
bottom
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
never
anything
be
compass
so
soon
,
and
purely
do
by
my
personal
credit
with
Mr.
Harley
,
who
be
so
excessively
obliging
,
that
I
know
not
what
to
make
of
it
,
unless
to
show
the
rascal
of
the
other
party
that
they
use
a
man
unworthily
who
have
deserve
better
.
 
<EOS>
the
memorial
give
to
the
Queen
from
me
speak
with
great
plainness
of
Lord
Wharton
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
this
business
be
as
important
to
you
as
the
Convocation
dispute
from
Tisdall
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
a
month
or
two
all
the
form
of
settle
this
matter
will
be
over
;
and
then
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
one
foolish
thing
more
,
because
it
be
just
come
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
thing
be
make
known
,
tell
me
impartially
whether
they
give
any
of
the
merit
to
me
,
or
no
<EOS>
;
for
I
be
sure
I
have
so
much
,
that
I
will
never
take
it
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
insolent
slut
!
<EOS>
because
I
say
Dublin
,
Ireland
,
therefore
you
must
say
London
,
England
:
 
<EOS>
that
be
Stella
's
malice
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
for
that
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
till
to
-
morrow
-
day
,
and
<EOS>
so
and
so
:
 
I
will
go
write
something
else
,
and
it
will
not
be
much
;
for
'
tis
late
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
Mr.
Lewis
,
the
under
-
secretary
to
Lord
Dartmouth
,
two
hour
,
talk
politic
,
and
contrive
to
keep
Steele
in
his
office
of
stamped
paper
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
lose
his
place
of
Gazetteer
,
three
hundred
pound
a
year
,
for
write
a
Tatler
,
some
month
ago
,
against
Mr.
Harley
,
who
give
it
him
at
first
,
and
raise
the
salary
from
sixty
to
three
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
this
be
devilish
ungrateful
;
and
Lewis
be
tell
me
the
particular
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
hint
give
me
,
that
I
may
save
him
in
the
other
employment
:
 
and
leave
<EOS>
be
give
me
to
clear
matter
with
Steele
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
dine
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
and
in
the
evening
go
to
sit
with
Mr.
Addison
,
and
offer
the
matter
at
distance
to
him
,
as
the
discreeter
person
;
but
find
party
have
so
possess
him
,
that
he
talk
as
if
he
suspect
me
,
and
would
not
fall
in
with
anything
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
stop
short
in
my
overture
,
and
we
part
very
drily
;
and
I
shall
say
nothing
to
Steele
,
and
let
them
do
as
they
will
;
but
,
if
thing
stand
as
they
be
,
he
will
certainly
lose
it
,
unless
I
save
him
;
and
therefore
I
will
not
speak
to
him
,
that
I
may
not
report
to
his
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
this
vexatious
?
<EOS>
and
be
there
so
much
in
the
proverb
of
proffer
service
?
<EOS>
when
shall
I
grow
wise
?
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
act
in
the
most
exact
point
of
honour
and
conscience
;
and
my
near
friend
will
not
understand
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
what
must
a
man
expect
from
his
enemy
?
 
<EOS>
this
would
vex
me
,
but
it
shall
not
;
and
so
I
bid
you
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
'
tis
neither
wit
nor
diversion
to
tell
you
every
day
where
I
dine
;
neither
do
I
write
it
to
fill
my
letter
;
but
<EOS>
I
fancy
I
shall
,
<EOS>
some
time
or
other
,
have
the
curiosity
of
see
some
particular
how
I
pass
my
life
when
I
be
absent
from
MD
this
time
;
and
so
I
tell
you
now
that
I
dine
to
-
day
at
Molesworth
's
,
the
Florence
Envoy
,
then
go
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
where
I
behave
myself
coldly
enough
to
Mr.
Addison
,
and
so
come
home
to
scribble
.
 
<EOS>
We
dine
together
to
-
morrow
and
next
day
by
invitation
;
but
I
shall
alter
my
behaviour
to
him
,
till
he
beg
my
pardon
,
or
else
we
shall
grow
bare
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
weary
of
friend
;
and
friendship
be
all
monster
,
but
MD
's
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
,
that
last
night
I
go
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
hope
 
faith
,
I
be
blunder
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
this
very
night
at
six
;
and
I
hope
he
would
have
tell
me
all
thing
be
do
and
grant
:
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
abroad
,
and
come
home
ill
,
and
be
go
to
bed
,
much
out
of
order
,
unless
the
porter
lie
.
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
at
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
's
,
with
Mr.
Addison
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
day
to
see
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
and
,
come
out
,
meet
Lord
Berkeley
of
Stratton
,
who
tell
me
that
Mrs.
Temple
,
the
widow
,
die
last
Saturday
,
which
,
I
suppose
,
be
much
to
the
outward
grief
and
inward
joy
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Addison
and
Steele
,
and
a
sister
of
Mr.
Addison
,
who
be
married
to
one
Mons
.
 
<EOS>
Sartre
,
a
Frenchman
,
prebendary
of
Westminster
,
who
have
a
delicious
house
and
garden
;
yet
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
a
sort
of
monastic
life
in
those
cloister
,
and
I
like
Laracor
better
.
 
<EOS>
Addison
's
sister
be
a
sort
of
a
wit
,
very
like
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
fond
of
her
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
day
to
see
Mr.
Congreve
,
who
be
almost
blind
with
cataract
grow
on
his
eye
;
and
his
case
be
,
that
he
must
wait
two
or
three
year
,
until
the
cataract
be
riper
,
and
till
he
be
quite
blind
,
and
then
he
must
have
them
couch
;
and
,
besides
,
he
be
never
rid
of
the
gout
,
yet
he
look
young
and
fresh
,
and
be
as
cheerful
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
young
by
three
year
or
more
than
I
;
and
I
be
twenty
year
young
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
a
pain
in
the
great
toe
,
by
mention
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
such
suspicion
frequently
,
but
they
go
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
second
letter
from
Mr.
Morgan
,
for
which
I
thank
you
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
be
whip
,
for
forget
to
send
him
that
answer
<EOS>
I
desire
you
in
one
of
my
former
,
that
I
could
do
nothing
for
him
of
what
he
desire
,
have
no
credit
at
all
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
go
,
be
far
enough
,
you
negligent
baggage
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
also
a
letter
from
Parvisol
,
with
an
account
how
my
living
be
set
;
and
that
they
be
fall
,
since
last
year
,
sixty
pound
.
 
<EOS>
a
comfortable
piece
of
news
!
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
plainly
that
he
find
you
have
no
mind
to
part
with
the
horse
,
because
you
send
for
him
at
the
same
time
you
send
him
my
letter
;
so
that
I
know
not
what
must
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
thing
that
Stella
must
have
her
own
horse
,
whether
Parvisol
will
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
to
answer
your
letter
that
I
have
three
or
four
day
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
now
in
bed
,
but
be
come
home
by
eight
;
and
,
it
be
warm
,
I
write
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
writ
to
the
Bishop
of
Killala
,
<EOS>
which
,
I
suppose
,
be
the
reason
he
have
not
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
time
,
there
be
the
short
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
fond
as
the
Dean
be
of
my
letter
,
he
have
not
write
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
only
know
whether
Dean
Bolton
pay
him
the
twenty
pound
;
and
for
the
rest
,
he
may
kiss
 
and
that
you
may
ask
him
,
because
I
be
in
pain
about
it
,
that
Dean
Bolton
be
such
a
whipster
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
the
most
obliging
thing
in
the
world
in
Dean
Sterne
to
be
so
kind
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
know
it
will
please
me
,
and
make
up
,
that
way
,
his
other
usage
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
we
have
have
none
of
your
snow
,
but
a
little
one
morning
;
yet
I
think
it
be
great
snow
for
an
hour
or
so
,
but
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
Will
Crowe
's
death
before
,
but
not
the
foolish
circumstance
that
hasten
his
end
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
have
take
care
that
Captain
Pratt
shall
not
suffer
by
Lord
Anglesea
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
some
contrivance
to
get
a
copy
of
my
picture
from
Jervas
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
buy
one
as
for
himself
,
and
I
will
pay
him
again
,
and
take
it
,
that
is
,
provide
I
have
money
to
spare
when
I
leave
this
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
John

<EOS>
and
Madam
Parvisol

<EOS>
Humm

<EOS>
why
,
Tighe
and
I
,
when
he

notice
of
each
other

I
would
not
do
it
much
in
this
town
,
though
we
have
not
fall
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to

day
at
Mr.
Sterne
's
lodging
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
not

and
Mr.
Leigh

;
but
I
will
do
Dingley
's
errand
when
I
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
I
know
whether
china
be
dear
or
no
?
 
<EOS>
I
once
take
a
fancy
of
resolve
to
grow
mad
for
it
,
but
now
it
be
off
;
I
suppose
I
tell
you
in
some
former
letter
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
you
only
want
some
salad
-
dish
,
and
plate
,
and
etc
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
you
shall
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
name
as
much
as
will
cost
five
pound
.
 
<EOS>
now
to
Stella
's
little
postscript
;
and
I
be
almost
craze
that
you
vex
yourself
for
not
write
.
 
<EOS>
can
not
you
dictate
to
Dingley
,
and
not
strain
your
little
,
dear
eye
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
be
the
grief
of
my
soul
to
think
you
be
out
of
order
.
<EOS>
pray
be
quiet
;
and
,
if
you
will
write
,
shut
your
eye
,
and
write
just
a
line
,
and
no
more
,
thus
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Stella
?
"
 
<EOS>
that
be
write
with
<EOS>
my
eye
shut
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
think
it
be
well
than
when
they
be
open
:
 
and
then
Dingley
may
stand
by
,
and
tell
you
when
you
go
too
high
or
too
low
.
 
<EOS>
My

I
hope

as
soon
as
I
see
Mr.
Harley
,
that
the
main
difficulty
be
over
,
and
that
the

but
I

<EOS>

he

a
very
ingenious
man
,
and
a
great

<EOS>
but
I
be
modest
and
say
,
may
be
the
gentleman
be
shy
,
and
not
fond
of
new
acquaintance
;
and
so
put
it
off
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
wish

could
hear
me
repeat
all
I
have
say
of
this
in
its
proper
tone

<EOS>
It
be
all
with

"

<EOS>
I

where
Congreve

and
only
take
a
spoonful
mixed
with
water
,
for
fear
of
the
gout
,
or
some
ugly
distemper
;
and
now
,
because
it

late
,
I
will

<EOS>
Garth
and
Addison
<EOS>
and
I
dine
to
-
day
at
a
hedge
tavern
;
then
I
go
to
Mr.
Harley
,
but
he
be
deny
,
or
not
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
fear
I
shall
not
hear
my
business
be
do
before
this
go
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
visit
Lord
Pembroke
,
who
be
just
come
to
town
;
and
we
be
very
merry
talking
of
old
thing
;
and
I
hit
him
with
one
pun
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
go
to
see
the
Ladies
Butler
,
and
the
son
of
a
whore
of
a
porter
deny

<EOS>
so
I
send
them
a
threatening
message
by
another
lady
,
for
not

me
always
to
the
porter
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
weary
of

I
do
,
like
a
fool
,
chat
till
twelve
,
and
now
be
get
into
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
the
new
Ministry
be
at
a
terrible
loss
about
money
:
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
talk
<EOS>
so
,
it
would
give
one
the
spleen
;
and
I
be
afraid
of
meet
Mr.
Harley
out
of
humour
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
he
will
never
carry
through
this
undertaking
.
 
<EOS>
God
know
what
will
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
terribly
vexed
to
see

come
round
again
:
 
<EOS>
it
will
ruin
the
Church

I
hope
for
better
.

and
likewise

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
I
have
no
giddiness
to

day
;
but
I
drink
brandy
,
and
have
buy
a
pint
for
two
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
up
the
night
before
my
giddiness
pretty
late
,
and
writ
very
much
;
so
I
will
impute
it
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
eat
fruit
,
nor
drink
ale
;
but
drink
well
wine
than
you
do
,
as
I
do
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Addison
at
Lord
Mountjoy
's
:
 
then
go
at
five
to
see
Mr.
Harley
,
who
could
not
see
me
for
much
company
;
but
send
me
his
excuse
,
and
desire
I
would
dine
with
him
on
Friday
;
and
then
I
expect
some
answer
to
this
business
,
which
must
either
be
soon
do
,
or
begin
again
;
and
then
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
his
people
will
interfere
for
their
honour
,
and
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
home
at
six
,
and
spend
my
time
in
my
chamber
,
without
go
to
the
Coffee

house
,
which
I
grow
weary
of
;
and
I
study
at
leisure
,
writ
not
above
forty
line
,
some
invention
of
my
own
,
and
some
hint
,
and
read
not
at
all
,
and
this
because
I
would
take
care
of
Presto

for
fear

should
be
angry
.

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
but
I

little
Dingley
to

for
I
think
I
mend
:

when

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
if

in
the
Coffee

house
,
for
I

and
be
plaguy
weary

for
Colonel

very
ill
company

and
I
will
never

I

the
Coffee

house

where
Dr.

would
fain
have
have
me
go
and
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
at
his
house
hard
by
,
with
Dr.
Chamberlen
,
but
the
puppy
use
so
many
word
,
that
I
be
afraid
of
his
company
;
and
though
we
promise
to
come
at
eight
,
I
send
a
messenger
to
him
,
that
Chamberlen
be
go
to
a
patient
,
and
therefore
we
would
put
it
off
till
another
time
:
 
<EOS>
so
he
,
and
the
Comptroller
,
and
I
,
be
prevail
on
by
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
to
go
to
his
house

<EOS>
Davenant
have
be
tease
me
to
look
over
some
of
his
writing
that
he
be
go
to
publish
;
but
the
rogue
be
so
fond
of
his
own
production
,
that
I
hear
he
will
not
part
with
a
syllable
;
and
he
have
lately
put
out
a
foolish
pamphlet
,
call
the
Third
Part
of
Tom
Double
;
to
make
his
court
to

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

Mr.
Harley
speak
all
the
kind
thing
to
me
in
the
world
;
and
,
I
believe
,
would
serve
me
,
if
I
be
to
stay
here
;
but
I
reckon
in
time
the
Duke
of
Ormond
may
give
me
some
addition
to
Laracor
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
the
Whigs
think
I
come
to
England
to
leave
them
?
 
<EOS>
sure
my
journey
be
no
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
sincerely
<EOS>
,
I
do
all
I
could
to
hinder
it
,
as
the
Dean
can
tell
you
,
although
now
I
do
not
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
who
the
Devil
care
what
they
think
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
under
obligation
in
the
least
to
any
of
them
all
?
 
<EOS>
Rot
'em
,
for
ungrateful
dog
;
I
will
make
them
repent
their
usage
before
I
leave
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
here
the
same
thing
of
my
leave
the
Whigs
;
but
they
own
they
can
not
blame
me
,
consider
the
treatment
I
have
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
of
your
spectacle
,
as
I
tell
you
before
,
and
of
the
Bishop
of
Killala
's
;
but
I
will
not
write
to
him
,
I
have
not
time
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
my
fourth
,
Madam
Dinglibus
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
Stella
say
you
have
have
my
fifth
<EOS>
,
Goody
Blunder
?
<EOS>
You
fright
me
till
I
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
this
be
enough
for
one
night
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
give
my
humble
service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte
and
her
sister
,
Kate
be
it
,
or
Sarah
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
forget
her
name
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
even
(
and
to
Mrs.
Walls
and
the
Archdeacon
)
send
this
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
no
,
faith
,
that
will
be
in
ten
day
from
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
keep
it
till
Saturday
,
though
I
write
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
what
if
a
letter
from
MD
should
come
in
the
meantime
?
 
<EOS>
why
then
I
would
only
say
,
"
Madam
,
I
have
receive
your
sixth
letter
;
your
most
humble
servant
to
command
,
Presto
"
;
and
so
conclude
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
now
I
will
write
and
think
a
little
,
and
so
to
bed
,
and
dream
of
MD
.

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
mouth
full
of
water
,
and
be
go
to
spit
it
out
,
because
I
reason
with
myself
,
how
could
I
write
when
my
mouth
be
full
?
 
<EOS>
han't
<EOS>
you
do
thing
like
that
,
reason
wrong
at
first
thinking
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
to
see
Mr.
Lewis
this
morning
,
and
be
to
dine
a
few
day
hence
,
as
he
tell
me
,
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
;
and
I
must
contrive
to
see
Harley
soon
again
,
to
hasten
this
business
from
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
at
Lord
Mountrath
's
,
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
but
the
wine
be
not
good
,
so
I
come
away
,
stay
at
the
Coffee
-
house
till
seven
,
then
come
home
to
my
fire
,
the
maidenhead
of
my
second
half
-
bushel
,
and
be
now
in
bed
at
eleven
,
as
usual
.
'
<EOS>
tis
mighty
warm
<EOS>
;
yet
I
fear
I
should
catch
cold
this
wet
weather
,
if
I
sit
an
evening
in
my
room
after
come
from
warm
place
:
 
and
I
must
make
much
of
myself
,
because
MD
be
not
here
to
take
care
of
Presto
;
and
I
be
full
of
business
,
writing
,
etc
.
,
and
do
not
care
for
the
Coffee
-
house
;
and
so
this
serve
for
all
together
,
not
to
tell
it
you
over
and
over
,
as
silly
people
do
;
but
Presto
be
a
wise
man
,
faith
,
than
so
,
let
me
tell
you
,
gentlewoman
.
 
<EOS>
see
,
I
be
get
to
the
third
side
;
but
,
faith
,
I
will
not
do
that
often
;
but
I
must
say
something
early
to
-
day
,
till
the
letter
be
do
,
and
on
Saturday
it
shall
go
;
so
I
must
leave
something
till
to
-
morrow
,
till
to
-
morrow
and
next
day
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
o
Lord
,
I
would
this
letter
be
with
you
with
all
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
if
it
should
miscarry
,
what
a
deal
would
be
lose
!
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
leave
a
gap
in
the
last
line
but
one
for
the
seal
,
like
a
puppy
;
but
I
should
have
allow
for
night
,
goodnight
;
but
when
I
be
take
leave
,
I
can
not
leave
a
bit
,
faith
;
but
I
fancy
the
seal
will
not
come
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to

day
at
Lady
Lucy
's
,
where
they
run
down
my

;
and
say
,

be
the
silly
poem
they
ever
read
;
and
tell
prior
so
,
whom
they
think
to
be
author
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
wonder
I
never
dine
there
before
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
too
busy
,
and
they
live
too
far
off
;
and
,
besides
,
I
do
not
like
woman

LETTER
9
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
November
11
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
,
by
invitation
,
with
the
Secretary
of
State
,
Mr.
St.
John
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
come
in
to
us
before
dinner
,
and
make
me
his
excuse
for
not
dine
with
us
,
because
he
be
to
receive
people
who
come
to
propose
advance
money
to
the
Government
:
 
there
dine
with
us
only
Mr.
Lewis
,
and
Dr.
Freind
(
that
writ
"
Lord
Peterborow
's
Actions
in
Spain
"
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
with
them
till
just
now
between
ten
and
eleven
,
and
be
force
again
to
give
my
eighth
to
the
bellman
,
which
I
do
with
my
own
hand
,
rather
than
keep
it
till
next
post
.
<EOS>
the
Secretary
use
me
with
all
the
kindness
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
prior
come
in
after
dinner
;
and
,
upon
an
occasion
,
he
(
the
Secretary
)
say
,
"
the
good
thing
I
ever
read
be
not
yours
,
but
Dr.
Swift
's
on
Vanbrugh
"
;
which
I
do
not
reckon
so
very
good
neither
.
 
<EOS>
but
Prior
be
damp
,
until
I
stuff
him
with
two
or
three
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
think
what
a
veneration
we
use
to
have
for
Sir
William
Temple
,
because
he
may
have
be
Secretary
of
State
at
fifty
;
and
here
be
a
young
fellow
,
hardly
thirty
,
in
that
employment
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
be
a
man
of
pleasure
,
that
walk
the
Mall
,
and
frequent
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
,
and
the
chocolate
-
house
;
and
the
young
son
be
principal
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
not
something
very
odd
in
that
?
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
among
other
thing
,
that
Mr.
Harley
complain
he
could
keep
nothing
from
me
<EOS>
,
I
have
the
way
<EOS>
so
much
of
get
into
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
be
a
refinement
;
and
so
I
tell
him
,
and
it
be
so
:
 
indeed
<EOS>
,
it
be
hard
to
see
these
great
man
use
me
like
one
who
be
their
better
,
and
the
puppy
with
you
in
Ireland
hardly
regard
me
:
 
but
there
be
some
reason
for
all
this
,
which
I
will
tell
you
when
we
meet
.
 
<EOS>
at
come
home
,
I
see
a
letter
from
your
mother
,
in
answer
to
one
I
send
her
two
day
ago
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
she
be
in
town
;
but
can
not
come
out
in
a
morning
,
just
as
you
say
;
and
God
know
when
I
shall
be
at
leisure
in
an
afternoon
:
 
for
if
I
should
send
her
a
penny
-
post
letter
,
and
afterwards
not
be
able
to
meet
her
,
it
would
vex
me
;
and
,
besides
,
the
day
be
short
,
and
why
she
can
not
come
early
in
a
morning
,
before
she
be
want
,
I
can
not
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
desire
her
to
let
Lady
Giffard
know
that
she
hear
I
be
in
town
;
and
that
she
would
go
to
see
me
,
to
inquire
after
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
she
will
confine
herself
so
much
to
that
old
beast
's
humour
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
can
not
in
honour
see
Lady
Giffard
,
and
consequently
not
go
into
her
house
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
think
be
enough
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
could
you
write
with
such
thin
paper
?
  
<EOS>
(
I
forgot
to
say
this
in
my
former
.
)
 
<EOS>
can
not
you
get
thick
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
that
be
a
common
caution
that
writing
-
master
give
their
scholar
;
you
must
have
hear
it
a
hundred
time
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
this
:
       
<EOS>
"
if
paper
be
thin
,
      
Ink
will
slip
in
;
      
but
,
if
it
be
thick
,
      
You
may
write
with
a
stick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
to
-
day
from
poor
Mrs.
Long

an
account
of
her

obscure
in

remote
country
town

and
how
easy
she
be
under
it
.
<EOS>
poor
creature
!
 
<EOS>
'
tis
just
such
an
alteration
in

,
as
if
Presto
should
be
banish

and
condemn
to

with
Mrs.
Raymond

<EOS>
I

with
Ford

Sir
Richard
Levinge
,
etc

,
at
a
place
where
they
board

hard
by

<EOS>
I
be
lazy
,
and
not
very
well
,
sit
so
long
with
company
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
busy
write
this
evening
at
home

and
have
a

bushel

and
now
be

and
'
tis

<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
and
then
go
to
christen
Will
Frankland
's
child
;
and
Lady
Falconbridge
be
one
of
the
godmother
:
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
daughter
of
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
extremely
like
him
by
his
picture
that
I
have
see
.
<EOS>
I
stay
till
almost
eleven
,
and
be
now
come
home
and
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
My
business
in
the
City
be
,
to
thank
Stratford
for
a
kindness
he
have
do
me
,
which
now
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
Bank
Stock
be
fall
thirty
-
four
in
the
hundred
,
and
be
mighty
desirous
to
buy
it
;
but
I
be
a
little
too
late
for
the
cheap
time
,
be
hinder
by
business
here
;
for
I
be
so
wise
to
guess
to
a
day
when
it
would
fall
.
 
<EOS>
My
project
be
this
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
three
hundred
pound
in
Ireland
;
and
so
I
writ
to
Mr.
Stratford
in
the
City
,
to
desire
he
would
buy
me
three
hundred
pound
in
Bank
Stock
,
and
that
he
should
keep
the
paper
,
and
that
I
would
be
bind
to
pay
him
for
them
;
and
,
if
it
should
rise
or
fall
,
I
would
take
my
chance
,
and
pay
him
interest
in
the
meantime
.
 
<EOS>
I
show
my
letter
to
one
or
two
people
who
understand
those
thing
;
and
they
say
money
be
so
hard
to
be
get
here
,
that
no
man
would
do
it
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
Stratford
,
who
be
the
most
generous
man
alive
,
have
do
it
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
cost
one
hundred
pound
and
a
half
,
that
is
,
ten
shilling
;
so
that
three
hundred
pound
cost
me
three
hundred
pound
and
thirty
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
do
about
a
week
ago
,
and
I
can
have
five
pound
for
my
bargain
already
.
 
<EOS>
before
it
fall
,
it
be
one
hundred
and
thirty
pound
;
and
we
be
sure
it
will
be
the
same
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
writ
to
your
mother
,
to
desire
that
Lady
Giffard
would
do
the
same
with
what
she
owe

for
they

hardly
die
together
;
and
,
when
one
die

you
fall
upon
the
other
,
and
make
him
add
another
security
:
 
and
if
Rathburn
(
now
I
have
his

)
pay
you
in
your

,
let
me
know
,

upon

<EOS>
come
home
at
seven
,
a
gentleman
unknown
stop
me
in
the
Pall
Mall
,
and
ask
my
advice
;
say
he
have
be
to
see
the
Queen
(
who
be
just
come
to
town
,
and
the
people
in
wait
would
not
let
him
see
her
<EOS>
;
that
he
have
two
hundred
thousand
man
ready
to
serve
her
in
the
war
;
that
he
know
the
Queen
perfectly
well
,
and
have
an
apartment
at
court
,
and
if
she
hear
he
be
there
,
she
would
send
for
him
immediately
;
that
she
owe
him
two
hundred
thousand
pound
,
etc
.
,
and
he
desire
my
opinion
,
whether
he
should
go
try
again
whether
he
could
see
her
;
or
because
,
perhaps
,
she
be
weary
after
her
journey
,
whether
he
have
not
better
stay
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
to
get
rid
of
my
companion
,
and
beg
him
of
all
love
to
go

wait
on
her
immediately
;
for
that

to
my

the

would
admit
him
;
that
this
be
an
affair
of
great
importance

and
require
despatch
:
 
and
I
instruct
him
to
let
me
know
the
success

the
Smyrna
Coffee

I
would
wait

I

half

meet
;
and
the
bishop
be
for
this
project
,
and
talk
coldly
of
my
be
solicitor
,
as
one
that
be
favour
by
t'other
party
,
etc
.
,
but
desire
that
I
would
still
solicit
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
wisdom
of
this
be
admirable
;
for
I
have
give
the
Archbishop
an
account
of
my
reception
from
Mr.
Harley
,
and
how
he
have
speak
to
the
Queen
,
and
promise
it
should
be
do
;
but
Mr.
Harley
order
me
to
tell
no
person
alive
.
 
<EOS>
some
time
after
,
he
give
me
leave
to
let
the
Primate
and
Archbishop
know
that
the
Queen
have
remit
the
first
-
Fruits
;
and
that
in
a
short
time
they
should
have
an
account
of
it
in
form
from
Lord
Dartmouth
,
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
so
while
their
letter
be
on
the
road
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Southwell
,
mine
be
go
to
them
with
an
account
of
the
thing
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
a
very
warm
answer
to
the
Archbishop
immediately
;
and
show
my
resentment
,
as
I
ought
,
against
the
bishop
;
only
,
in
good
manner
,
except
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
will
say
when
they
hear
the
thing
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
yesterday
force
to
tell
Southwell
so
,
that
the
Queen
have
do
it
,
etc
.
;
for
he
say
,
my
Lord
Duke
would
think
of
it
some
month
hence
,
when
he
be
go
for
Ireland
;
and
he
have
it
three
year
in
do
formerly
,
without
any
success
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
free
leave
to
say
,
on
occasion
,
that
it
be
do
;
and
that
Mr.
Harley
prevail
on
the
Queen
to
do
it
,
etc
.
,
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
hope
to
live
,
I
despise
the
credit
of
it
,
out
of
an
excess
of
pride
;
and
desire
<EOS>
you
will
not
give
me
the
least
merit
when
you
talk
of
it
;
but
I
would
vex
the
bishop
,
and
have
it
spread
that
Mr.
Harley
have
do
it
:
 
<EOS>
pray
do
so
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
send
me
last
night
a
parcel
of
wax
candle
,
and
a
bandbox
full
of
small
plumcake
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
have
be
something
for
you
;
and
,
without
open
them
,
send
answer
by
the
maid
that
bring
them
,
that
I
would
take
care
to
send
the
thing
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
but
I
will
write
her
thank
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
a
long
letter
,
sirrah
?
  
<EOS>
now
,
be
you
satisfied
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
no
fit
since
the
first
:
 
<EOS>
I
drink
brandy
every
morning
,
and
take
pill
every
night
.
 
<EOS>
never
fear
,
I
an't
vex
at
this
puppy
business
of
the
bishop
,
although
I
be
a
little
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
my
reward
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
will
think
he
have
do
me
a
favour
;
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
perhaps
,
that
I
have
put
a
neglect
on
him
;
and
the
bishop
in
Ireland
,
that
I
have
do
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
so
go
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
get
above
all
this
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
have
well
reason
for
it
than
they
know
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
you
shall
hear
no
more
of
first
-
fruit
,
duke
,
harley
,
archbishop
,
and
Southwells
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
slip
off
Raymond
upon
some
of
his
countryman
,
to
show
him
the
town
,
etc
.
,
and
I
lend
him
Patrick
.
 
<EOS>
He
desire
to
sit
with
me
in
the
evening
;
upon
which
I
have
give
Patrick
positive
order
that
I
be
not
within
at
evening
.

<EOS>
LONDON
,
November
25
,
1710
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
something
that
be
plaguy
silly
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
forget
to
say
on
the
23d
in
my
last
,
where
I
dine
;
and
because
I
have
do
it
constantly
,
I
think
it
be
a
great
omission
,
and
be
go
to
interline
it
;
but
at
last
the
silliness
of
it
make
me
cry
,
<EOS>
Pshah
,
and
<EOS>
I
let
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
be

day
to
see
the
Parliament
meet
;
but
only
see
a
great
crowd
;
and
Ford
<EOS>
and
I
go
to
see
the
tomb
at
Westminster
,
and
saunter
so
long
I
be
force
to
go
to
an
eat
-
house
for
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Bromley
be
choose
Speaker
,
nemine
contradicente
:
 
<EOS>
do
you
understand
those
two
word
?
  
<EOS>
and
Pompey
,
Colonel
Hill
's
black
,
design
to
stand
Speaker
for
the
footman
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
engage
to
use
my
interest
for
him
,
and
have
speak
to
Patrick
to
get
him
some
vote
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
now
all
impatient
for
the
Queen
's
speech
,
what
she
will
say
about
remove
the
Ministry
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
cold
,
and
I
do
not
know
how
;
but
get
it
<EOS>
I
have
,
and
be
hoarse
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
will
grow
better
or
bad
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
that
to
you
?
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
keep
you
a
little
longer
in
suspense
:
I
can
not
send
it
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
's
cake
be
very
good
,
and
one
of
them
serve
me
for
a
breakfast
,
and
so
I
will
go
sleep
like
a
good
boy
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
cruel
cold
,
and
stay
within
all
this
day
in
my
nightgown
,
and
dine
on
sixpennyworth
of
victual
,
and
read
and
writ
,
and
be
deny
to
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Raymond
call
often
,
and
I
be
deny
;
and
at
last
,
when
I
be
weary
,
I
let
him
come
up
,
and
ask
him
,
without
consequence
,
how
Patrick
deny
me
,
and
whether
he
have
the
art
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
so
by
this
mean
he
shall
be
use
to
have
me
deny
to
him
;
otherwise
he
would
be
a
plaguy
trouble
and
hindrance
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
sit
with
me
two
hour
,
and
drank
a
pint
of
ale
cost
me
fivepence
,
and
smoke
his
pipe
,
and
it
be
now
past

that
he
be
just

.
 
<EOS>
well

my
eighth
be
with
you
now
,
young
woman
;
and
your
seventh
to
me
be
somewhere
in
a
post
-
boy
's
bag
;
and
so
go
to
your
gang
of
dean
,
and
Stoytes
,
and
wall
,
and
lose
your
money
;
go
,
sauceboxe
:
 
and

,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
day
Mr.
Harley
meet
me
in
the
Court
of
Requests
,
and
whisper
me
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
dinner
I
tell
him
what
those
bishop
have
do
,
and
the
difficulty
I
be
under
.
 
<EOS>
He
bid
me
never
trouble
myself
;
he
would
tell
the
Duke
of
Ormond
<EOS>
the
business
be
do
,
and
that
he
nee
not
concern
himself
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
I
be
easy
,
and
they
may
hang
themselves
for
a
parcel
of
insolent
,
ungrateful
rascal
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
tell
you
in
my
last
,
how
they
send
an
address
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
a
letter
to
Southwell
,
to
call
on
me
for
the
paper
,
after
the
thing
be
over
;
but
they
have
not
receive
my
letter
,
though
the
Archbishop
may
,
by
what
I
writ
to
him
,
have
expect
it
would
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
an
end
of
that
;
and
in
a
little
time
the
Queen
will
send
them
notice
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
the
method
will
be
settle
;
and
then
I
shall
think
of
return
,
although
the
baseness
of
those
bishop
make
me
love
Ireland
less
than
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Halifax
send
to
invite
me
to

;
where
I
stay
till
six
,
and
cross
him
in
all
his
Whig
talk
,
and
make
him
often
come
over
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
make
court
to
the
new
man
,
although
he
affect
to
talk
like
a
Whig
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
to

day
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
;
but
I
writ
to
him
lately
,
that
I
would
obey
his
command
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
I
bid
him
read
the
London

Shaver
,
"
and
that
you
both
swear
it
be
"
Shaver

and

<EOS>
"
You
all
lie

and
you

and
can
not

Presto
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
be
out
entirely
in
his
conjecture
of
my
share
in
the
Tatlers
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
other
thing
to
mind
,
and
of
much
great
importance
;
else
I
have
little
to
do
to
be
acquaint
with
a
new
Ministry
,
who
consider
me
a
little
more
than
irish
bishop
do
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
(
She

)
 
<EOS>

not
deceive
me
,
Stella
,
when
you
say
you

the
Blind
Quay

Mr.
Leigh
that
he

ill
;
and
in
short
,
speak
so
,
that
he
almost
put
poor
Leigh
into
tear
,
and
would
have
make
me
run
distract
;
though
your
letter
be
date
the
11th
instant
,
and
I
see
Smyth
in
the

above
a
fortnight
ago
,
as

.
 
<EOS>
Pray

Stella
,
until
you

mighty

mighty
,
mighty
well
in
your
eye
,
and
be
sure
it
will
not
do
you
the
least
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
or
come
,
I
will
tell

what
;
you
,
Mistress
Stella
,
shall
write
your

at
five
or
six
sitting
,
one

;
and
then

all
together
,
and
then
Stella

little
crumb
towards
the
end
,
to
let
us
see
she

Presto
;
and
then
conclude
with
something
handsome
and
genteel
,
as
your
most
humblecumdumble
,
or

etc
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord

<EOS>
do

?
 
<EOS>
Insolent
man
!
<EOS>

my
secret
?
 
<EOS>
no
;
as
my
Lord
Mayor
say
,
no
;
if
I
think
my
shirt
know
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
will
come
as
soon
as
it
be
any
way
proper
for
me
to
come
;
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
be
at
present
a
little
involved
with
the
present
Ministry
in
some
certain
thing
(
which
I
tell
you
as
a
secret
)
;
and
soon
as
ever
I
can
clear
my
hand
,
I
will
stay
no
longer
;
for
I
hope
the
first
-
Fruit
business
will
be
soon
over
in
all
its
form
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
the
present
Ministry
have
a
difficult
task
,
and
want
me
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
they
may
be
just
as
grateful
as
other
:
 
but
,
accord
to
the
good
judgment
I
have
,
they
be
pursue
the
true
interest
of
the
public
;
and
therefore
I
be
glad
to
contribute
what
be
in
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
not
a
word
of
this
to
any
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Chancellor
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
madam
,
I
can
tell
you
he
have
be
dead
this
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
could
hardly
forbear
our
little
language
about
a
nasty
dead
Chancellor
,
as
you
may
see
by
the
blot
.
 
<EOS>
plough
?
  
<EOS>
a
pox
plough
them
;
they
will
plough
me
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
but
have
you
get
your
money
,
<EOS>
both
the
ten
pound
?
 
<EOS>
how
durst
he
pay
you
the
second
so
soon
?
  
<EOS>
Pray

good
huswife
.
<EOS>
ay

and
Joe

why

I

desire
I
would
take
some
care
of
their
poor
town
,
who
,
he
say
,
will
lose
their
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
to
which
I
desire
Dr.
Raymond
would
return
answer
,
that
the
town
have
behave
themselves
so
ill
to
me
,
so
little
regard
the
advice
I
give
them
,
and
disagree
so
much
among
themselves
,
that
I
be
resolve
never
to
have
more
to
do
with
them
;
but
that
whatever
personal
kindness
I
could
do
to
Joe
,
should
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
when
you
happen
to
see
Joe
,
tell
him
this
,
lest
Raymond
should
have
blunder
or
forget
 
Poor
Mrs.
Wesley

<EOS>
why

<EOS>
why

<EOS>
so

<EOS>
be
it
not
whimsical
that
the
Dean
have
never

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

with

if

I
will
just
say
I
receive
a

I

only
that
I

I

have

a

It

ill
fortune

<EOS>
I

and
I

be
force
to

:
 
'
tis
now
six
o'clock
,
and
I
be
come
home
after
a
pure
walk
in
the

;
delicate
weather
,
begin
only
to

day
.
 
<EOS>
a
terrible
storm
last
night
:
 
<EOS>
we
hear
one
of
your
packet
-
boat
be
cast
away
,
and
young
Beau
Swift
in
it
,
and
General
Sankey
:
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
the
truth
;
you
will
before
me
.
<EOS>
Raymond
talk
of
leave
the
town
in
a
few
day
,
and
go
in
a
month
to
Ireland
,
for
fear
his
wife
should
be
too
far
go
,
and
force
to
be
bring
to
bed
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
in
the
right
;
but
perhaps
this
packet
-
boat
will
fright
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
relish
for
London
;
and
I
do
not
wonder
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
get
some
Templars
from
Ireland
that
show
him
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
let
him
see
me
above
twice
a
week
,
and
that
only
while
I
be
dress
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
now
the
puppy
's
come
in
,
and
I
have
get
my
own
ink
,
but
a
new
pen
;
and
so
now
you
be
rogue
and
sauceboxe
<EOS>
till
I
go
to
bed
;
for
I
must
go
study
,
sirrah
.
<EOS>
now
I
think
of
it
,
tell
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
he
shall
not
cheat
me
of
one
inch
of
my
bell
metal
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
it
be
nothing
but
to
save
the
town
money
;
and
Enniskillen
can
afford
it
better
than
Laracor
:
 
<EOS>
he
shall
have
<EOS>
but
one
thousand
five
hundred
weight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
read
,
etc

,
as
usual
,
and
be
now
go
to
bed
;

I
find
this

enough
:
 
<EOS>
so
get
you

then

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

and
the

again
lock
up
my

,
notwithstanding
all
I
say
to
him
yesterday
;
but
he

me
,
so
all
be
well
:
 
<EOS>
they
be
light

and
I
will
go
study
.
 
<EOS>
the
fair
weather
be
go
again
,
and
it
have
rain
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
this
open
weather
,
though
some
say
it
be
healthy
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
it
be
a
false
report
about
the
plague
at
Newcastle
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
news
to

day
:
 
<EOS>
I

and
Lady

to
see
who
do
best
:
 
mine

.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
Duke
of
Richmond

<EOS>
I
be
now
in

;
and
it
have
rain
all
this
evening
,
like

<EOS>
have
you
so
much
rain
in
your
town
?
 
<EOS>
Raymond
be
in
a
fright
,
as
I
expect
,
upon
the
news
of
this
shipwreck
;
but
I

in
a

<EOS>
I

him

with
Sir
Robert
Raymond
,
the
Solicitor
-
General
,
who
own
him
to
be

his
family

and
I
believe
it
may
do
him
a
kindness
,
by
be
recommend
to
your
new
Lord
Chancellor
.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
I

;
I
will
make
Parvisol
get
you
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
doubt
that
horse
of
yours
:
 
<EOS>
prythee
sell
him
,
and
let
it
be
a
present
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
ache
when
I
think
you
ride
him
.
 
<EOS>
Order
Parvisol
to
sell
him
,
and
that
you
be
to
return
me
the
money
:
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
easy
until
he
be
out
of
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
have
dreamt
five
or
six
time
of
horse
stumble
since
I
have
your
letter
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
can
not
sell
him
,
let
him
run
this
winter
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
if
I
be
near
you
,
I
would
whip
your
#

#

to
some
tune
,
for
your
grave
,
saucy
answer
about
the
Dean
and
Johnsonibus
;
I
would
,
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
and
do
the
Dean
preach
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
would
they
have
me
stand
here
and
preach
to
them
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
the
Tatler
of
the
Shilling
be
not
mine
,
more
than
the
hint
,
and
two
or
three
general
head
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
much
more
important
business
on
my
hand
;
and
,
besides
,
the
Ministry
hate
to
think
that
I
should
help
him
,
and
have
make
reproach
on
it
;
and
I
frankly
tell
them
I
would
do
it
no
more
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
secret
though
,
Madam
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
You
win
eight
shilling

<EOS>
you
win
eight
fiddlestick

<EOS>
Faith

you
say
nothing
of
what
you
lose
,
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Manley
be
in
no
great
danger
;
for
Ned
Southwell
be
his
friend
,
and
so
be
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
;
and
his
brother
John
Manley
stand
up
heartily
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
on
t'other
side

<EOS>
now

Mistress

Pray

<EOS>
so

at
Stoyte

and
Mrs.

rapture
that
I
remember

<EOS>
I
must
do

but
<EOS>
seldom

or

will
take
off
her
rapture
.
<EOS>
but

<EOS>

<EOS>
faith

if
I
go
on

in
this
trick
of

in
the

I
shall
be

.
 
<EOS>
good

,
sirrah

I
will
rise

<EOS>
at

.
 
<EOS>
I

to
the
Court
of
Requests
<EOS>
(
I
will
not
answer
the
rest
of
your
letter
yet
,
that
by
the
way
,
in
hope
to
dine
with
Mr.

:
 
but
Lord
Dupplin
,
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
tell
me
he
do
not
dine
at
home
;
so
I
be
at
a
loss
,
until
I
meet
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
go
home
and
dine
with
him
,
where
he
tell
me
of

<EOS>
Lord

me
two
day
ago
,
that
he
be
resolve
to
come
Sunday
fortnight
next
to

.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
the
day
be
not
yet
fix
,
and
I
know
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
the
Secretary
tell
me
that
his
father
,
Sir
Harry
St.
John
,
and
Lord
Rivers

's
Church
,
to
hear
me
preach
there
;
and
be
assure
I
be
to
preach
:
 
<EOS>
so
there
will
be
another
bite
;
for
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
but
that
Mr.
Harley
and
St.
John
be

I
must
preach
before
the
Queen
;
and
the
Secretary
of
State
have

but
I
desire
to
be
excuse
,
which
he
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
St.
John
,
"
You
shall
not
be
excuse
"
:
 
however
,
I
hope
they
will
forget
it
;
for
if
it
should
happen
,
all
the
puppy
hereabouts
will
throng
to
hear
me
,
and
expect
something
wonderful
,
and
be
plaguily
baulk
;
for
I
shall
preach
plain
honest
stuff
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
with
St.
John
till
eight
,
and
then
come
home
;
and
Patrick
desire
leave
to
go
abroad
,
and
by
and
by
come
up
the
girl
to
tell
me
,
a
gentleman
be
below
in
a
coach
,
who
have
a
bill
to
pay
me
;
so
I
let
him
come
up
,
and
who
should
it
be
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Addison
and
Sam
Dopping
,
to
haul
me
out
to
supper
,
where
I
stay
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
if
Patrick
have
be
at
home
,
I
should
have
"
scape
this
;
for
I
have
teach
him
to
deny
me
almost
as
well
as
Mr.
Harley
's
porter
.
 
<EOS>
where
do
I
leave
off
in
MD
's
letter
?
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
now
I
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
pleased
to
say
,
Madam
Dingley
,
that
those
who
go
for
England
can
never
tell
when
to
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
mean
this
as
a
reflection
upon
Presto
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
Sauceboxes
,
I
will
come
back
as
soon
as
I
can
,
as
hope
save
,
and
I
hope
with
some
advantage
,
unless
all
ministry
be
alike
,
as
perhaps
they
may
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Hawkshaw
be
in
Dublin
before
now
,
and
that
you
have
your
thing
,
and
like
your
spectacle
:
 
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
,
you
shall
have
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Dingley
's
tobacco
do
not
spoil
Stella
's
chocolate
,
and
that
all
be
safe
:
 
<EOS>
pray
let
me
know
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
be
different
as
black
and
white
,
and
I
believe
our
friendship
will
go
off
,
by
this
damned
business
of
party
:
 
<EOS>
he
can
not
bear
see
me
fall
in
so
with
this
Ministry
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
love
him
still
as
well
as
ever
,
though
we
seldom
meet
.
 
<EOS>
Hussy
,
Stella
,
you
jest
about
poor
Congreve
's
eye
<EOS>
;
you
do
so
,
hussy
;
but
I
will
bang
your
bone
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Steele
be
a
little
while
in
prison
,
or
at
least
in
a
spunging
-
house
,
some
time
before
I
come
,
but
not
since
.
 
<EOS>
p
ox
on
your
convocation
,
and
your
Lamberts
<EOS>
;
they
write
with
a
vengeance
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
think
it
a
piece
of
affectation
in
me
to
wish
your
irish
folk
would
not
like
my
"
shower
,
"
;
but
you
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
have
the
general
applause
there
as
I
have
here
(
though
I
say
it
)
;
but
I
have
only
that
of
one
or
two
,
and
therefore
I
would
have
none
at
all
,
but
let
you
all
be
in
the
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
this
be
not
what
I
would
say
;
but
I
be
so
tosticated
with
supper
and
stuff
,
that
I
can
not
express
myself
.
 
<EOS>
what
you
say
of
"
Sid
Hamet
"
be
well
enough
;
that
an
enemy
should
like
it
,
and
a
friend
not
;
and
that
tell
the
author
would
make
both
change
their
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
tell
Griffyth
that
you
fancy
there
be
something
in
it
of
my
manner
;
but
first
spur
up
his
commendation
to
the
height
,
as
we
serve
my
poor
uncle
about
the
sconce
that
I
mend
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
desire
you
to
give
what
I
intend
for
an
answer
to
Mrs.
Fenton
,
to
save
her
postage
,
and
myself
trouble
;
and
I
hope
I
have
do
it
,
if
you
han't
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
what
a
long
day
's
writing
be
yesterday
's
answer
to
your
letter
,
sirrah
!
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Lewis
and
Ford
,
whom
I
have
bring
acquaint
.
<EOS>
Lewis
tell
me
a
pure
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
hanker
with
Mr.
Harley
to
save
Steele
his
other
employment
,
and
have
a
little
mercy
on
him
;
and
I
have
be
say
the
same
thing
to
Lewis
,
who
be
Mr.
Harley
's
chief
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
tell
Mr.
Harley
how
kindly
I
should
take
it
,
if
he
would
be
reconcile
to
Steele
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
,
on
my
account
,
fall
in
with
it
,
and
appoint
Steele
a
time
to
let
him
attend
him
,
which
Steele
accept
with
great
submission
,
but
never
come
,
nor
send
any
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
whether
it
be
blunder
,
sullenness
,
insolence
,
or
rancour
of
party
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
I
shall
trouble
myself
no
more
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Addison
hinder
him
out
of
mere
spite
,
be
grate
to
the
soul
to
think
he
should
ever
want
my
help
to
save
his
friend
;
yet
now
he
be
solicit
me
to
make
another
of
his
friend
Queen
's
Secretary
at
Geneva
;
and
I
will
do
it
if
I
can
;
it
be
poor
Pastoral
Philips
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
o

why
do
you
leave
my
picture
behind
you
at
t'other
lodging
?
 
<EOS>
forgot
it
?
 
<EOS>
well
;
but
pray
remember
it
now
,
and
do
not
roll
it
up
,
d'ye
hear
;
but
hang
it
carefully
in
some
part
of
your
room
,
where
chair
and
candle
and
mop
-
stick
will
not
spoil
it
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
truly
,
I
will
not
be
godfather
to
Goody
Walls
this
bout
,
and
I
hope
she
will
have
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
there
will
be
no
quiet
nor
card
for
this
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
die
the
day
after
the
christening
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
give
me
a
paper
,
with
an
account
of
the
sentence
you
speak
of
against
the
lad
that
deface
the
statue
,
and
that
Ingoldsby
reprieve
that
part
of
it
of
stand
before
the
statue
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
never
execute
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
get
your
broderick
out
;
Doyne
be
to
succeed
him
,
and
Cox
Doyne
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
there
be
an
end
of
your
letter
;
'
tis
all
answer
;
and
now
I
must
go
on
upon
my
own
stock
.
 
<EOS>
go
on
,
do
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
have
write
enough
;
but
this
be
too
soon
to
send
it
yet
,
young
woman
;
faith
,
I
dare
not
use
you
to
it
<EOS>
,
you
will
always
expect
it
;
what
remain
shall
be
only
short
journal
of
a
day
,
and
so
I
will
rise
for
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
my
opposite
neighbour
,
Darteneuf
;
and
I
be
solicit
this
day
to
present
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
Vice
-
Chancellor
;
but
it
will
not
do
;
they
be
all
set
against
him
,
and
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
they
say
,
have
resolve
to
dispose
of
it
somewhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
well
;
little
saucy
rogue
,
do
not
stay
out
too
late
to
-
night
,
because
it
be
Saturday
night
,
and
young
woman
should
come
home
soon
then
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
Court
to
seek
a
dinner
:
 
but
the
Queen
be
not
at
church
,
she
have
get
a
touch
of
the
gout
;
so
the
Court
be
thin
,
and
I
go
to
the
Coffee
-
house
;
and
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
and
his
eld
son
<EOS>
and
I
go
and
dine
with
his
son
William
.
 
<EOS>
I
talk
a
great
deal
to
Sir
Thomas
about
Manley
;
and
find
he
be
his
good
friend
,
and
so
have
Ned
Southwell
be
,
and
I
hope
he
will
be
safe
,
though
all
the
irish
folk
here
be
his
mortal
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
devilish
bite
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
it
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
how
,
that
I

;
an
abundance
go
,
among
the
rest
Lord
Radnor
,
who
never
be
abroad
till
three
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
all
the
way
home
from
Hatton
Garden
at
six
,
by
moonlight
,
a
delicate
night
.
 
<EOS>
Raymond

at
nine
,
but
I
be
deny
;
and
now
I
be
in
bed
between
eleven
and

,
just
go
to
sleep
,
and
dream
of
my

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
I
have
be
sometimes
like
to
do
it
at
the
top
of
my

,
until
I
remark
it
would
be
old
before
it
reach

<EOS>
I

and
we

but
I

<EOS>
It

and
I
will
say
no

but
end
this
line
with
bid
my

etc

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
a

,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He

apology

,

Pray

<EOS>
You

I
wish

<EOS>
I
be
at

to

day
by

,
and
receive
the
sacrament
,
and
come
home
by

;
then
go
to
Court
at
two
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
Collar
-
day
,
that
is
,
when
the
Knights
of
the
Garter
wear
their
collar
;
but
the
Queen
stay
so
late
at
Sacrament
,
that
I
come
back
,
and
dine
with
my
neighbour
Ford
,
because
all
people
dine
at
home
on
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
likewise
a
Collar
-
day
all
over
England
in
every
house
,
at

where
there
be
BRAWN
:
 
<EOS>
that
be
very
well

<EOS>
I
tell
you
a
good

a
fellow
hard
by
pretend
to
cure
ague
,
and
have
set
out
a
sign
,
and
spell
it
EGOES

a

and
I
observe
it
,
he
say
,
"
how
do
that
fellow
pretend
to
cure
AGUES
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
be
sure
it
be
not
by
a
SPELL
.
<EOS>
that
be
admirable
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
you
ask
the
Bishop
about
that
pun
of
Lord
Stawel
's
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Bite

<EOS>
have
I
catch
you

<EOS>
Must
you
pretend
to
ask
after
roguish
pun
,

too
?
 
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
meet
Vedeau
again
at

I
fancy
<EOS>
he
be
broke
,
and
have
get
a
commission
,
but
I
never
ask
him

<EOS>
Vedeau

yet
Parvisol

be
Vedel

that
be
true

<EOS>
Bank
Stock

I
could

;
but
I
do
not
intend
to
sell
,
and
in

it

<EOS>
It
be
odd
that
my
Lord
Peterborow
foretold
this
loss
two
month
ago
,
one
night
at
Mr.
Harley
's
,
when
I
be
there
;
he
bid
us
count
upon
it
,
that
Stanhope
would
lose
Spain
before
Christmas
;
that
he
would
venture
his
head
upon
it
,
and
give
us
reason
;
and
though
Mr.
Harley
argue
the
contrary
,
he
still
hold
to
his
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
my
Lord
Angelsea
this
at
court
this
morning
;
and
a
gentleman
by
say
he
have
hear
my
Lord
Peterborow
affirm
the

thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
wise
folk
say
,
"
an
ill
tongue
may
do
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
'
tis
an
odd
saying
,
       
"
<EOS>
once
I
guess
right
,
      
<EOS>
and
I
get
credit
by't
;
      
<EOS>
Thrice
<EOS>
I
guess
wrong

<EOS>
and
I
keep
my

on

<EOS>
I
call
at
Mr.

,
who
be
not

drop

drive

I

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
bespoke
a
lodging
over
the
way
for
tomorrow
,
and
the
dog
let
it
yesterday
to
another
;
I
give
him
no
earnest
,
so
<EOS>
it
seem
he
could
do
it
;
Patrick
would
have
have
me
give
him
earnest
to
bind
him
;
but
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
must
go
saunter
to
-
day
for
a
lodging
somewhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
so
open
a

<EOS>
We
have
not

<EOS>
o

<EOS>
,
I
dreamt
mightily
of
MD
last

;
but
so
confused
,
I
can
not
tell
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
Ford
acquaint
with
Lewis
;
and
to

day
we
dine
together
:
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
I
call
at
one
or
two
neighbour
,
hope
to
spend
a
Christmas
evening
;
but
none
be
at
home
,
they
be
all
go
to
be
merry
with
other

<EOS>
I
have
often
observe
this
,
that
in
merry
time
everybody
be
abroad
;
where
the
deuce
be
they
?
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
the
Coffee

house
,
and
talk
with
Mr.
Addison
an
hour
,
who
at
last
remember
to

<EOS>
neither
<EOS>

I
can
assure

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
and
,
when
I

whether
I
think
it
possible
he
could
live
;
for
the
doctor
think
not

<EOS>
I
say
,
I
believe
he
would
live
;
for
I
find
the
seed
of
life
in
him
,
which
I
observe

(
and
I

Patrick
say
I
must
rise

<EOS>
Night
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
early
this
morning
with
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
give
him
a
memorial
to
get
the
Queen
's
letter
for
the
First
-
Fruits
,
who
have
promise
to
do
it
in
a
very
few
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
have
be
with
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
who
be
lament
his
former
wrong
step
in
join
with
the
Whigs
,
and
say
he
be
wear
out
with
age
,
fatigue
,
and
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
swear
it
pity
me
;
and
I
really
think
they
will
not
do
well
in
too
much
mortifying
that
man
,
although
indeed
it
be
his
own
fault
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
covetous
as
hell
,
and
ambitious
as
the
Prince
of
it
:
 
he
would
fain
have
be
General
for
life
,
and
have
break
all
endeavour
for
peace
,
to
keep
his
greatness
and
get
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
the
Queen
he
be
neither
covetous
nor
ambitious
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
if
she
could
have
conveniently
turn
about
,
she
would
have
laugh
,
and
could
hardly
forbear
it
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
fall
in
with
all
the
abominable
measure
of
the
late
Ministry
,
because
they
gratify
him
for
their
own
design
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
have
be
a
successful
General
,
and
I
hope
he
will
continue
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord

<EOS>
Mr.

verse
of
Prior
's

<EOS>
I

without

;
and
prior
swear
,
I
should
never
read
any
of
his

;
but
he
would
be
revenge
,
and
read
some
of
mine
as
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
excuse
myself
,
and
say
I
be
famous
for
read
verse
the

;
and

<EOS>
now

<EOS>
do
not
you

for
what

simpleton

<EOS>
what
say

<EOS>
and
so
you

Presto

little
birthday
,
I
warrant
:
would
to
God
I
have
be
at
the
health
rather
than
here
,
where
I
have
no
manner
of
pleasure
,
nothing
but
eternal
business
upon
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
grow
wise
in
time
;
but
no
more
of
that
:
 
only
I
say
amen
with
my
heart
and
vital
,
that
we
may
never
be
asunder
again
ten
day
together
while
poor
presto
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
merry
so
near
any
splenetic
talk
;
so
I
make
that
long
line
,
and
now
all
be
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
you
be
a
pretending
slut
,
indeed
,
with
your
fourth

the
margin
,
and
your
journal
,
and
everything
.
 
<EOS>
wind
 
<EOS>
we
see
no
wind
here
,
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
it
once
when
you
have
it
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
an
old
saying
and
a
true
:
       
<EOS>
"
I
hate
all
wind
,
     
before
and
behind
,
     
from
cheek
with
eye
,
     
or
from
blind
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
Your
chimney
fall
down
!
 
<EOS>
God
preserve
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
only
mean
a
brick
or
two
:
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
a
d####ned
lie
of
your
chimney
be
carry
to
the
next
house
with
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
put
such
thing
upon
us
;
those
matter
will
not
pass
here
:
 
keep
a
little
to
possibility
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Hertford
would
have
be
ashamed
of
such
a
stretch
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
take
care
of
what
company
you
converse
with
:
 
when
one
get
that
faculty
,
'
tis
hard
to
break
one
's
self
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Jemmy
Leigh
talk
of
go
over
;
but
quando
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know

come
up

<EOS>
Will

<EOS>
five
hundred

<EOS>
do
you
call

month
the

<EOS>
They
say
she
die
with
grief
,
partly
,
be
force
to
appear
as
a
witness
in
court
about
some
squabble
among
their
servant
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
show
you
a
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
you
must
not
give
your
mind
to
believe
those
thing
;
people
will
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
the
Character
be
here
reckon
admirable
,
but
most
of
the
fact
be
trifle
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
first
print
privately
here
;
and
then
some
bold
cur
venture
to
do
it
publicly
,
and
sell
two
thousand
in
two
day
:
 
who
the
author
be
must
remain
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
pretend
to
know
,
impudence
?
 
<EOS>
how
durst
you
think
so
?
 
<EOS>
Pox
on
your
parliament
:
the
Archbishop
have
tell
me
of
it
;
but
we
do
not
vouchsafe
to
know
anything
of
it
here
.
 
<EOS>
no

no
more
of
your
giddiness
yet
;
thank
you
,
Stella
,
for
ask
after
it
;
thank
you
;
God
Almighty
bless
you
for
your
kindness
to
poor
Presto
.
<EOS>
You
write
to
Lady
Giffard
and
your
mother
upon
what
I
advise
when
it
be
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
I
fancy
this
bad
news
will
bring
down
stock
so
low
,
that
one
may
buy
to
great
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
venture
go
to
see
your
mother
<EOS>
some
day
when
Lady
Giffard
be
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
keep
your
rathburn
and
stuff
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
to
pay
in
your
money
upon
his
house
to
be
fling
down
about
the
what
do
you
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Madam
Dingley
,
I

Raymond
since

.
 
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
<EOS>
young
woman
,
I
keep
a
good
fire
;
it
cost
me
twelvepence
a
week
,
and
I
fear
something
more
;
vex
me
,
and
I
will
have
one
in
my
bed
-
chamber
too
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
do
not
I
tell
you
but
just
now
,
we
have
no
high
wind
here
?
 
<EOS>
have
you
forget
already
?
 
<EOS>
now
you
be
at
it
again
,
silly
Stella
;
why
do
your
mother
say
my
candle
be
scandalous
?
 
<EOS>
They
be
good
six
in
the
pound
,
and
she
say
I
be
extravagant
enough
to
burn
them
by
daylight
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
burn
fewer
at
a
time
than
one
.
 
<EOS>
what
would
people
have
?
 
<EOS>
the
D

burst
Hawkshaw
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
have
not

box
;
and
the
next
day
Sterne
tell
me
he
have
send
it
a
fortnight
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
could
not
find
him
t'other
day
,
but
he
shall
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
dear
life
and
heart
,
do
you
tease
me
?
<EOS>
do
Stella
tease
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
that
palsy
-
water
be
in
the
box
;
it
be
too
big
for
a
packet
,
and
I
be
afraid
of
its
breaking
.
<EOS>
Leigh
be
not
in
town
then
;
or
I
would
not
have
trust
it
to
Sterne
,
whom
<EOS>
yet
I
have
befriend
enough
to
do
me
more
kindness
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
rest
till
you
have
it
,
or
till
it
be
in
a
way
for
you
to
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
poor
dear
rogue
,
naughty
<EOS>
to
think
it
tease
me
;
how
could
I
ever
forgive
myself
for
neglect
anything
that
relate
to
your
health
?
 
<EOS>
sure
I
be
a
Devil
if
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
see
how
far
I
be
force
to
stand
from
Stella
,
because
I
be
afraid
she
think
poor
Presto
have
not
be
careful
about
her
little
thing
;
I
be
sure
I
buy
them
immediately
accord
to
order
,
and
pack
them
up
with
my
own
hand
,
and
send
them
to
Sterne
,
and
be
six
time
with
him
about
send
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
be
pleased
with
your
glass
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
another
velvet
cap
;
a
new
one
Lord
Herbert
buy
and
present
me
one
morning
I
be
at
breakfast
with
him
,
where
he
be
as
merry
and
easy
as
ever
I
see
him
,
yet
have
receive
a
challenge
half
an
hour
before
,
and
half
an
hour
after
fight
a
duel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
ten
day
ago
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
mistaken
in
your
guess
about
tatler
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
neither
write
that
on
Noses
nor
Religion
,
nor
do
I
send
him
of
late
any
hint
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Stella
,
when
I
read
your
letter
,
I
be
not
uneasy
at
all
;
but
when
I
come
to
answer
the
particular
,
and
find
that
you
have
not
receive
your
box
,
it
grate
me
to
the
heart
,
because
I
think
,
through
your
little
word
,
that
you
imagine
I
have
not
take
the
care
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
some
blunder
in
this
matter
,
<EOS>
which
I
will
know
to
-
morrow
,
and
write
to
Sterne
,
for
fear
he
should
not
be
within
.
 
<EOS>
and
pray
,
pray
,
Presto
,
pray
now
do
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
Raymond
be
not
above
four
time
with
me
while
he
stay
,
and
then
only
while
I
be
dress
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fenton
have
write
me
another
letter
about
some
money
of
hers
in
Lady
Giffard
's
hand
,
that
be
entrust
to
me
by
my
mother
,
not
to
come
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
my
letter
constantly
every
fortnight
,
and
,
if
you
will
have
them
oftener
,
you
may
,
but
then
they
will
be
the
short
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
let
Parvisol
sell
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
speak
to
you
of
it
in
a
former
letter
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
be
rid
of
him
,
and
be
in
pain
while
I
think
you
ride
him
;
but
,
if
he
would
buy
you
another
,
or
anybody
else
,
and
that
you
could
be
often
able
to
ride
,
why
do
not
you
do
it
?
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
go
this
morning
early
to
the
Secretary
of
State
,
Mr.
St.
John
;
and
he
tell
me
from
Mr.
Harley
that
the
warrant
be
now
draw
,
in
order
for
a
patent
for
the
first
-
Fruits
:
 
<EOS>
it
must
pass
through
several
office
,
and
take
up
some
time
,
because
in
thing
the
Queen
give
they
be
always
considerate
;
but
that
,
he
assure
me
,
'
tis
grant
and
do
,
and
past
all
dispute
,
and
desire
I
will
not
be
in
any
pain
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
again
to
the
Archbishop
to
-
morrow
,
and
tell
him
this
,
and
I
desire
you
will
say
it
on
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
Secretary
I
go
to
Mr.
Sterne
,
who
say
he
would
write
to
you
to
-
night
;
and
that
the
box
must
be
at
Chester
;
and
that
some
friend
of
his
go
very
soon
,
and
will
carry
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
at
six
go
to
Darteneufs
house
to
drink
punch
with
him
,
and
Mr.
Addison
,
and
little
Harrison
,
a
young
poet
,
whose
fortune
I
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
Steele
be
to
have
be
there
,
but
come
not
,
nor
never
do
twice
,
since
I
know
him
,
to
any
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
till
past
eleven
,
and
be
now
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Steele
's
last
tatler
come
out
to

day
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
see
it
before
this
come
to
you
,
and
how
he
take
leave
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
tell
so
much
as
Mr.
Addison
of
it
,
who
be
surprised
as
much
as
I
;
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
it
be
time
,
for
he
grow
cruel
dull
and
dry
.
 
<EOS>
to
my
knowledge
he
have
several
good
hint
to
go
upon
;
but
he
be
so
lazy
and
weary
of
the
work
that
he
would
not
improve
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
send
this
after
to

:
 
<EOS>
shall
I

I
could
not
possibly
doubt
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
-
day
accordingly
,
and
see
him
among
half
a
dozen
lawyer
and
attorney
and
hang
-
dog
,
signing
of
deed
and
stuff
before
his
journey
;
for
he
go
to
-
morrow
to
Vienna
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
among
that
scurvy
company
till
after
four
,
but
hear
nothing
of
Spain
;
only
I
find
,
by
what
he
tell
me
before
,
that
he
fear
he
shall
do
no
good
in
his
present
journey
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
to
be
mighty
constant
correspondent
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
take
my
leave
of
him
,
and
call
at
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
,
who
mend
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
home
,
<EOS>
an't
<EOS>
please

and
have
be

<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
little
dear
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
,
I
have
be
dream
;
I
be
to
be
put
in
prison
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
,
and
I
be
so
afraid
of
a
black
dungeon
;
and
then
all
I
have
be
inquire
yesterday
of
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
sickness
I
think
be
of
poor
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
of
dream
be
,
that
one
wake
just
in
the
humour
they
leave
one
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
this
to
-
day
?
 
<EOS>
with
all
my
heart
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
two
day
within
the
fortnight
;
but
may
be
MD
be
in
haste
to
have
a
round
dozen
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
how
be
you
come
up
to
me
with
your
eighth
,
young
woman
?
 
<EOS>
but
you
indeed
ought
to
write
twice
slow
than
I
,
because
there
be
two
of
you
;
I
own
that
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
I
will
seal
up
this
letter
by
my
morning
candle
,
and
carry
it
into
the
city
with
me
,
where
I
go
to
dine
,
and
put
it
into
the
post
-
office
with
my
own
fair
hand
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
let
me
see
whether
I
have
any
news
to
tell
MD
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
they
will
very
soon
make
some
inquiry
into
the
corruption
of
the
late
Ministry
;
and
they
must
do
it
,
to
justify
their
turn
them
out
.
<EOS>
Atterbury
,
we
think
,
be
to
be
Dean
of
Christ
Church
in
Oxford
;
but
the
College
would
rather
have
Smalridge
 
<EOS>
what
be
all
this
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
what
care
you
for
Atterburys
and
Smalridges
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
you
care
for
nothing
but
Presto
,
faith
.
<EOS>
so
I
will
rise
,
and
bid
you
farewell
;
yet
I
be
loth
to
do
so
,
because
there
be
a
great
bit
of
paper
yet
to
talk
upon
;
but
Dingley
will
have
it
so
:
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
she
,
"
make
your
journal
short
,
and
send
them
oftener
;
"
and
so
I
will
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
cheat
you
another
way
too
;
for
this
be
clip
paper
,
and
hold
at
least
six
line
less
than
the
former
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
a
good
thing
I
say
to
my
Lord
Carteret
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
,
"
say
he
,
"
my
Lord
come
up
to
me
,
and
ask
me
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
my
Lord
never
do
,
nor
ever
can
come
up
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
all
pun
here
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Carteret
set
down
Prior
t'other
day
in
his
chariot
;
and
prior
thank
him
for
his
CHARITY
;
that
be
fit
for
Dilly
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
I
hear
one
good
one
from
the
Ministry
;
which
be
really
a
shame
.
 
<EOS>
Henley

;
but
I
have
only

it
once
,
and
will
do
it
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
see
me
for
some
time
in

Coffee
-
house
,
and
ask
after
me
,
desire
Lord
Herbert
to
tell
me
I
be
a
beast
for
ever
,
after
the
order
of
Melchisedec

<EOS>
do
you
ever
read
the
scripture
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
change
the
word
priest
to
beast
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
bewitch
,
to
write
so
much
in
a
morning
to
you
,
little
MD
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
go
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
and
I
will
come
again
to

night
in
a
fine
clean
sheet
of
paper
;
but
I
can
nor
will
stay
no
longer
now
;
<EOS>
no

I
will
not

for
all
your

do
not

"
 
<EOS>
ah

<EOS>

<EOS>
nay

but

and

<EOS>
o

faith
,
my

and
I
must
go
now
in
spite
of
my

<EOS>
so

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I
must
have
another

when
I

but
I
will
fold

office
as
I

,
which
be
not
till

this
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
people
that
you
never
hear
of
,
nor
be
it
worth
your
while
to
know
;
an
authoress
and
a
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
home
for
exercise
,
and
at
eleven
get
to
bed
;
and
,
all
the
while
I
be
undress
myself
<EOS>
,
there
be
I
speak
monkey
thing
in

,
just
as
if
MD

and
do
not
recollect
myself
till
I
get

<EOS>
I
writ
last

to
the
Archbishop
,
and
tell
him

for
the
first
-
Fruits
;
and
I
tell
him

but
it
seem
the
Lords
have
address
to
have
him

,
to
be
examine
about
spanish
affair
,
upon
this
defeat
there
,
and
to
know
where
the
fault
lie
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
writ
to
the
Archbishop
a
lie
;
but
I
think
it
be
not
a
sin
.

<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
send
for
me
this
morning
so
early
,
that
I
be
force
to
go
without
shaving
,
which
put
me
quite
out
of
method
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
at
Mr.
Ford
's
,
and
desire
him
to
lend
me
a
shaving
;
and
so
make
a
shift
to
get
into
order
again
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
here
be
an
impertinence
:
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
mother
and
sister
be
come
above
a
hundred
mile
,
from
Worcester
,
to
see
him
before
he
die
.
 
<EOS>
They
get
here
but
yesterday
;
and
he
must
have
be
past
hope
,
or
past
fear
,
before
they
could
reach
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
a
scolding
when
I
hear
they
be
come
;
and
the
people
about
him
wonder
at
me
,
and
say
what
a
mighty
content
it
would
be
on
both
side
to
die
when
they
be
with
him
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
mother
;
she
be
the
great
Overdo
upon
earth
;
and
the
sister
,
they
say
,
be
bad
;
the
poor
man
will
relapse
again
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
scoundrel
brother
always
cry
in
the
outer
room
till
Sir
Andrew
be
in
danger
;
and
the
dog
be
to
have
all
his
estate
if
he
die
;
and
it
be
an
ignorant
,
worthless
,
scoundrel
-
rake
:
 
and
the
nurse
be
comfort
him
,
and
desire
he
would
not
take
on
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
the
first
time
with
Ophy
Butler
and
his
wife
;
and
you
sup
with
the
Dean
,
and
lose
two
-
and
-
twenty
penny
at
card
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
Mrs.
Walls
be
bring
to
bed
of
a
girl
,
who
die
two
day
after
it
be
christen
;
and
,
betwixt
you
and
me
<EOS>
,
she
be
not
very
sorry
:
she
love
her
ease
and
diversion
too
well
to
be
trouble
with
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
last
night
to
put
some
coal
on
my
fire
after
Patrick
be
go
to
bed
;
and
there
I
see
in
a
closet
a
poor
linnet
he
have
buy
to
bring
over
to
Dingley
:
 
<EOS>
it
cost
him
sixpence
,
and
be
as
tame
as
a
dormouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
do
not
know
he
be
a
bird
:
 
<EOS>
where
you
put
him
,
there
he
stand
,
and
seem
to
have
neither
hope
nor
fear
;
I
suppose
in
a
week
he
will
die
of
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
advise
with
me
before
he
buy
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
fairly
before
him
the
greatness
of
the
sum
,
and
the
rashness
of
the
attempt
;
show
how
impossible
it
be
to
carry
him
safe
over
the
salt
sea
:
 
but
he
would
not
take
my
counsel
;
and
he
will
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
cold
this
morning
in
bed
;
and
I
hear
there
be
a
good
fire
in
the
room
without

what
do
you
call
it

)
,
the
dining

<EOS>
I

and
so
let

do
so
.
 
<EOS>
at

<EOS>

me
this
morning
in
all
haste
;
but
I
would
not
lose
my
shaving
,
for
fear
of
miss
church
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
Court
,
which
be
of
late
always
very
full
;
and
young
Manley
and
I
dine
at
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
talk
politic
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
I
be
afraid
we
shall
all
be
embroil
with
party
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
,
now
they
be
fall
,
be
the
most
malicious
toad
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
now
a
second
misfortune
,
the
loss
of
several
Virginia
ship
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
people
will
begin
to
think
that
nothing
thrive
under
this
Ministry
:
 
and
if
the
Ministry
can
once
be
render
odious
to
the
people
,
the
Parliament
may
be
choose
Whig
or
Tory
as
the
Queen
please
.
<EOS>
then
I
think
our
friend
press
a
little
too
hard
on
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
.
<EOS>
the
country
member
be
violent
to
have
past
fault
inquire
into
,
and
they
have
reason
;
but
I
do
not
observe
the
Ministry
to
be
very
fond
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
we
have
nothing
to
save
us
but
a
peace
;
and
I
be
sure
we
can
not
have
such
a
one
as
we
hope
;
and
then
the
Whigs
will
bawl
what
they
would
have
do
have
they
continue
in
power
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
the
Ministry
this
as
much
as
I
dare
;
and
shall
venture
to
say
a
little
more
to
them
,
especially
about
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
who
,
as
the
Whigs
give
out
,
will
lay
down
his
command
;
and
I
question
whether
ever
any
wise
state
lay
aside
a
general
who
have
be
successful
nine
year
together
,
whom
the
enemy
so
much
dread
,
and
his
own
soldier
can
not
but
believe
must
always
conquer
;
and
you
know
that
in
war
opinion
be
nine
part
in
ten
.
 
<EOS>
the
Ministry
hear
me
always
with
appearance
of
regard
,
and
much
kindness
;
but
I
doubt
they
let
personal
quarrel
mingle
too
much
with
their
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
,
they
seem
to
value
all
this
as
nothing
,
and
be
as
easy
and
merry
as
if
they
have
nothing
in
their
heart
or
upon
their
shoulder
;
like
physician
,
who
endeavour
to
cure
,
but
feel
no
grief
,
whatever
the
patient
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
what
be
all
this
?
  
<EOS>
do
you
know
one
thing
,
that
I
find
I
can
write
politic
to
you
much
easy
than
to
anybody
alive
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
swear
my
head
be
full
;
and
I
wish
I
be
at
Laracor
,
with
dear
,
charming
MD
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
,
young
woman
<EOS>
,
I
have
make
a
great
progress
in
four
day
,
at
the
bottom
of
this
side
already
,
and
no
letter
yet
come
from
MD
(
that
word
interline
be
morning
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
have
be
write
state
affair
to
MD
.
<EOS>
how
do
they
relish
it
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
anything
that
come
from
Presto
be
welcome
;
though
really
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
if
they
have
their
choice
,
not
to
disguise
the
matter
,
they
have
rather
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Presto
,
I
must
tell
you
,
you
grow
silly
,
say
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
that
is
but
one
body
's
opinion
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
I
promise
to
be
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
this
morning
;
but
I
be
lazy
,
and
will
not
go
,
because
I
have
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
,
to
desire
I
would
dine
there
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
chid
;
but
what
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
here
have
be
Mrs.
South
with
me
,
just
come
from
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
and
go
to
market
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
still
in
a
fever
,
and
may
live
or
die
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
and
sister
be
now
come
up
,
and
in
the
house
;
so
there
be
a
lurry
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
Mrs.
South
half
a
pistole
for
a
New
Year
's
gift
.
 
<EOS>
so
good
-
morrow
,
dear
both
,
till
anon
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
have
be
with
Mr.
Secretary
from
dinner
till
eight
;
and
,
though
I
drink
wine
and
water
,
I
be
so
hot
!
 
<EOS>
Lady
Stanley
come
to
visit
Mrs.
St.
John
,
and
send
up
for
me
to
make
up
a
quarrel
with
Mrs.
St.
John
,
whom
I
never
yet
see
;
and
do
you
think
that
devil
of
a
Secretary
would
let
me
go
,
but
keep
me
by
main
force
,
though
I
tell
him
I
be
in
love
with
his
lady
,
and
it
be
a
shame
to
keep
back
a
lover
,
etc
.
?
 
<EOS>
but
all
would
not
do
;
so
at
last
I
be
force
to
break
away
,
but
never
go
up
,
it
be
then
too
late
;
and
here
I
be
,
and
have
a
great
deal
to
do
to
-
night
,
though
it
be
nine
o'clock
;
but
one
must
say
something
to
these
naughty
MD
's
,
else
there
will
be
no
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
day
Ford
and
I
set
apart
to
go
into
the
City
to
buy
book
;
but
we
only
have
a
scurvy
dinner
at
an
alehouse
;
and
he
make
me
go
to
the
tavern
and
drink
Florence
,
four
and
sixpence
a
flask
;
damned
wine
!
<EOS>
so
I
spend
my
money
,
which
I
seldom
do
,
and
pass
an
insipid
day
,
and
see
nobody
,
and
it
be
now
ten
o'clock
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
that
'
tis
a
fortnight
to
-
morrow
since
I
have
a
letter
from
MD
;
but
if
I
have
it
time
enough
to
answer
here
,
'
<EOS>
tis
<EOS>
well
enough
,
otherwise
woe
betide
you
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
the
toyman
's
,
here
just
in
Pall
Mall
,
and
he
sell
great
hugeous
battoon
;
yes
,
faith
,
and
so
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
he
,
Dingley
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
lose
your
money
this
Christmas
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
this
morning
to
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
.
 
<EOS>
I
promise
yesterday
,
but
fail
,
so
can
not
write
any
more
till
night
to
poor
,
dear
MD
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
<EOS>
o
,
faith
,
Dingley
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
company
in
the
morning
,
and
could
not
go
where
I
design
;
and
I
have
a
basket
from
Raymond
at
Bristol
,
with
six
bottle
of
wine
and
a
pound
of
chocolate
,
and
some
tobacco
to
snuff
;
and
he
writ
under
,
the
carriage
be
pay
;
but
he
lie
,
or
I
be
cheat
,
or
there
be
a
mistake
;
and
he
have
write
to
me
so
confusedly
about
some
thing
,
that
Lucifer
could
not
understand
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
wine
be
to
be
drunk
with
Harley
's
brother
and
Sir
Robert
Raymond
,
Solicitor
-
General
,
in
order
to
recommend
the
doctor
to
your
new
Lord
Chancellor
,
who
leave
this
place
on
Monday
;
and
Raymond
say
he
be
hasting
to
Chester
,
to
go
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
leave
his
wife
behind
;
for
when
he
leave
London
he
have
no
thought
of
stir
till
summer
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
suppose
he
will
be
with
you
before
this
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
come
and
desire
I
would
dine
with
him
,
because
it
be
Opera
-
day
;
which
I
do
,
and
send
excuse
to
Lord
Shelburne
,
who
have
invite
me
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
set
up
a
new
Tatler
,
little
Harrison
,
whom
I
have
mention
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
other
have
put
him
on
it
,
and
I
encourage
him
;
and
he
be
with
me
this
morning
and
evening
,
show
me
his
first
,
which
come
out
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
will
not
succeed
,
for
I
do
not
much
approve
his
manner
;
but
the
scheme
be
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
's
and
mine
,
and
would
have
do
well
enough
in
good
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
recommend
him
to
a
printer
,
whom
I
send
for
,
and
settle
the
matter
between
them
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Harrison
have
just
leave
me
,
and
I
be
tired
with
correct
his
trash
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
upon
some
business
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
he
make
me
promise
to
dine
with
him
;
which
otherwise
I
would
have
do
with
Mr.
Harley
,
whom
I
have
not
be
with
these
ten
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
think
they
have
mighty
difficulty
upon
them
;
yet
I
always
find
them
as
easy
and
disengage
as
schoolboy
on
a
holiday
.
 
<EOS>
Harley
have
the
procuring
of
five
or
six
million
on
his
shoulder
,
and
the
Whigs
will
not
lend
a
groat
;
which
be
the
only
reason
of
the
fall
of
stock
:
 
for
they
be
like
Quakers
and
fanatic
,
that
will
only
deal
among
themselves
,
while
all
other
deal
indifferently
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Marlborough
offer
,
if
they
will
let
her
keep
her
employment
,
never
to
come
into
the
Queen
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
say
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
will
serve
no
more
;
but
I
hope
and
think
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
to
Heaven
<EOS>
I
be
this
minute
with
MD
at
Dublin
;
for
I
be
weary
of
politic
,
that
give
me
such
melancholy
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
have
an
ugly
giddy
fit
last
night
in
my
chamber
,
and
I
have
get
a
new
box
of
pill
to
take
,
and
hope
I
shall
have
no
more
<EOS>
this
good
while
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
you
before
,
because
it
would
vex
you
,
little
rogue
;
but
now
it
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Lord
Shelburne
;
and
to
-
day
<EOS>
little
Harrison
's
new
Tatler
come
out
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
in
it
,
but
I
hope
he
will
mend
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
understand
that
,
upon
Steele
's
leave
off
,
there
be
two
or
three
scrub
Tatlers
come
out
,
and
one
of
them
hold
on
still
,
and
to
-
day
it
advertise
against
Harrison
's
;
and
so
there
must
be
dispute
which
be
genuine
,
like
the
strop
for
razor
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
the
little
toad
have
not
the
true
vein
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
a
copy
of
verse
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr.
St.
John
be
turn
out
from
be
Secretary
at
War
,
three
year
ago
,
he
retire
to
the
country
:
 
there
<EOS>
he
be
talk
of
something
he
would
have
write
over
his
summer
-
house
,
and
a
gentleman
give
him
these
verse
        
from
business
and
the
noisy
world
retire
,
     
nor
vex
by
love
,
nor
by
ambition
fire
;
     
<EOS>
gently
I
wait
the
call
of
Charon
's
boat
,
     
still
drink
like
a
fish
,
and
 
like
a
stoat
.
  
<EOS>
He
swear
to
me
he
could
hardly
bear
the
jest
;
for
he
pretend
to
retire
like
a
philosopher
,
though
he
be
but
twenty
-
eight
year
old
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
the
thing
be
true
:
 
for
he
have
be
a
thorough
rake
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
three
grave
line
do
introduce
the
last
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
od
<EOS>
so
,
but
I
will
go
sleep
;
I
sleep
early
now
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
,
young
woman
<EOS>
,
I
want
a
letter
from
MD
;
'
tis
now
nineteen
day
since
I
have
the
last
:
 
and
where
have
I
room
to
answer
it
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
send
this
away
without
any
answer
at
all
;
for
I
will
hasten
it
,
and
away
it
go
on
Tuesday
,
by
which
time
this
side
will
be
full
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
it
two
day
sooner
on
purpose
out
of
spite
;
and
the
very
next
day
after
,
you
must
know
,
your
letter
will
come
,
and
then
'
tis
too
late
,
and
I
will
so
laugh
,
never
see
the
like
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
spring
with
us
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
eat
asparagus
t'other
day
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
such
a
frostless
winter
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
lie
still
extremely
ill
;
it
cost
him
ten
guinea
a
day
to
doctor
,
surgeon
,
and
apothecary
,
and
have
do
so
these
three
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Ford
;
he
sometimes
choose
to
dine
at
home
,
and
I
be
content
to
dine
with
him
;
and
at
night
I
call
at
the
Coffee
-
house
,
where
I
have
not
be
in
a
week
,
and
talk
coldly
a
while
with
Mr.
Addison
.
 
<EOS>
all
our
friendship
and
dearness
be
off
:
 
<EOS>
we
be
civil
acquaintance
,
talk
word
of
course
,
of
when
we
shall
meet
,
and
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
at
any
house
with
him
these
six
week
:
<EOS>
t'other
day
we
be
to
have
dine
together
at
the
Comptroller
's
;
but
I
send
my
excuse
,
be
engage
to
the
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
it
odd
?
<EOS>
but
I
think
he
have
use
me
ill
;
and
I
have
use
him
too
well
,
at
least
his
friend
Steele
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
cost
me
three
guinea
to

day
for
a
periwig

<EOS>
I
be
undone

<EOS>
It
be
make
by
a
Leicester
lad
,
who
marry
Mr.
Worrall
's
daughter
,
where
my
mother
lodge
;
so
I
think
it
would
be
cheap
,
and
especially
since
he
live
in
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
London
lickpenny
:
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
give
Harrison
hint
for
another
Tatler
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
the
jackanapes
want
a
right
taste
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
will
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
my
friend
Lewis
of
the
Secretary
's
office
,
and
be
get
home
early
,
because
I
have
much
business
to
do

but
before
I
begin
,
I
must
needs
say
something
to
MD

faith
 
no

I

house
for
a
letter
from

;
so
the
man
say
he

Patrick
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
go
to
the
Court
of
Requests
and
Treasury
,
to
find
Mr.
Harley
,
and
,
after
some
time
spend
in
mutual
reproach
,
I
promise
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
there
till

,
then
call
at
Sterne
's
and
Leigh

<EOS>
Sterne
say
he

<EOS>
I
suppose

lie
at
Chester
,
at
least
I
hope
so
,
and
only
want
a
lift
over
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
here
have
little
Harrison
be
to
complain
that
the
printer
I
recommend
to
him
for
his
Tatler
be
a
coxcomb
;
and
yet
to
see
how
thing
will
happen
;
for
this
very
printer
be
my

but
the
dog
Patrick
be
abroad
;
at
last
he
come
,
and
I
get
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
another
hand
have
superscribe
it
;
when
I
open
it
,
I
find
it
write
all
in
French
,
and
subscribe
bernage
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
I
be
ready
to
fling
it
at
Patrick
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
bernage
tell
me
he
have
be
to
desire
your
recommendation
to
me
,
to
make
him
a
captain
;
and
your
cautious
answer
,
that
he
have
as
much
power
with
me
as
you
,
be
a
notable
one
;
if
you
be
here
,
I
would
present
you
to
the
Ministry
as
a
person
of
ability
.
 
<EOS>
bernage
should
let
me
know
where
to
write
to
him
;
this
be
the
second
letter
I
have
have
without
any
direction
;
however
,
I
beg
<EOS>
I
may
not
have
a
third
,
but
that
you
will
ask
him
,
and
send
me
how
I
shall
direct
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
tell
him
that
if
regiment
be
to

raise
here
,
as
he
say
,
I
will
speak
to
George
Granville
,
Secretary
at
War
,
to
make
him
a
captain
;
and
use
what
other
interest
I
conveniently
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
be
enough
,
and
so
tell
him
,
and
do
not
trouble
me
with
his
letter
,
when
I
expect
them
from
MD
;
do
you
hear
,
young
woman
?
<EOS>
write
to
Presto
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
we
be
to
dine
at
Mr.
Harley
's
alone
,
about
some
business
of
importance
;
but
there
be
two
or
three
gentleman
there
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
and
I
go
together
from
his
office
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
and
think
to
have
be
very
wise
;
but
the
deuce
a
bit
,
the
company
stay
,
and
more
come
,
and
Harley
go
away
at
seven
,
and
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
stay
with
the
rest
of
the
company
till
eleven
;
I
would
then
have
have
him
come
away
;
but
he
be
in
for't
;
and
though
he
swear
he
would
come
away
at
that
flask
,
there
I
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
the
civility
of
these
people
;
when
he
see
I
would
drink
no
more
,
he
would
always
pass
the
bottle
by
me
,
and
yet
I
could
not
keep
the
toad
from
drink
himself
,
nor
he
would
not
let
me
go
neither
,
nor
Masham
,
who
be
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
get
home
,
I
find
a
parcel
direct
to
me
;
and
open
it
<EOS>
,
I
find
a
pamphlet
write
entirely
against
myself
,
not
by
name
,
but
against
something
I
writ
:
it
be
pretty
civil
,
and
affect
to
be
so
,
and
I
think
I
will
take
no
notice
of
it
;
'
tis
against
something
write
very
lately
;
and
indeed
I
know
not
what
to
say
,
nor
do
I
care
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
you
be
a
saucy
rogue
for
lose
your
money
to
-
day
at
Stoyte
's
;
to
let
that
bungler
beat
you
,
fie
,
Stella
,
an't
<EOS>

ashamed
?
 
<EOS>
well

once
,
never
do
so
again
;
no
,
noooo
.
 
<EOS>
kiss
and
be
friend
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
let
me
go
sleep
,
I
go
earlier
to
bed
than
formerly
;
and
have
not
be

<EOS>
so
late
these

but
the

in
a
drinking
humour
.
 
<EOS>
so

<EOS>

<EOS>
then

and
so

be

<EOS>
this

an
insipid
snowy

and
I

gravely
with
Mrs.

,
and
come
home
,
and
be

I

"

so
I

come
in
Ben
Tooke

and
then
I
shave
and
scribble
;
and
it
be
such
a
terrible
day
,
I
could
not
stir
out
till
one
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
call
at

<EOS>
so
now
,
my
dearly

proceed
to
the

<EOS>
You
be
always
grumble
that
<EOS>
you
han't
letter
fast
enough
;
"
surely
we
shall
have
your
tenth
;
"
and
yet
,
before
you
end
your
letter
,
you
own
<EOS>
you
have
my
eleventh
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
do
not
MD
go
into
the
country
with
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
?
<EOS>
faith
,
such
a
journey
would
have
do
you
good
;
Stella
should
have
ride
,
and
Dingley
go
in
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Kilmore
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
;
he
be
old
,
and
may
die
;
he
live
in
some
obscure
corner
,
for
I
never
hear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
my
old
friend
,
if
you
mean
the
Whigs
,
I
never
see
them
,
as
you
may
find
by
my
journal
,
except
Lord
Halifax
,
and
him
very
seldom
;
Lord
Somers
never
since
the
first
visit
,
for
he
have
be
a
false
,
deceitful
rascal
.
 
<EOS>
My
new
friend
be
very
kind
,
and
I
have
promise
enough
,
but
I
do
not
count
upon
them
,
and
besides
my
pretence
be
very
young
to
them
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
will
see
what
may
be
do
;
and
if
nothing
at
all
,
I
shall
not
be
disappoint
;
although
perhaps
poor
MD
may
,
and
then
I
shall
be
sorry
for
their
sake
than
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
talk
of
a
merry

,
I
have
wish

.
 
<EOS>
good
lack
;
and
your
news
,
that
Mr.
St.
John
be
go
to
Holland
<EOS>
;
he
have
no
such
thought
,
to
quit
the
great
station
he
be
in
;
nor
,
if
he
have
,
could
I
be
spare
to
go
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
faith
,
politic
Madam
Stella
,
you
come
with
your
two
egg
a
penny
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Madam
Dingley
,
and
so
Mrs.
Stoyte
invite
you
,
and
so
you
stay
at
Donnybrook
,
and
so
you
could
not
write
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
plaguy
exact
in
your
journal
,
from
December
25
to
January
4
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Smyth
and
the
palsy
-
water
I
have
handle
already
,
and
he
do
not
lodge
(
or
rather
do
not
,
for
,
poor
man
,
now
he
be
go
)
at
Mr.
Jesse
's
,
and
all
that
stuff
;
but
we
find
his
lodging
,
and
I
go
to
Stella
's
mother
on
my
own
head
,
for
I
never
remember
it
be
in
the
letter
to
desire
another
bottle
;
but
I
be
so
fretted
,
so
tosticated
,
and
so
impatient
that
Stella
should
have
her
water
<EOS>
(
I
mean
decently
,
do
not
be
rogue
)
,
and
so
vexed
with
Sterne
's
carelessness
.
 
<EOS>
pray
God
,
Stella
's
illness
may
not
return
!
 
<EOS>
if
they
come
seldom
,
they
begin
to
be
weary
;
I
judge
by
myself
;
for
when
I
seldom
visit
,
I
grow
weary
of
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
leave
a
good
deal
of
my
tenth
unanswered
!
 
<EOS>
impudent
slut
,
when
do
you
ever
answer
my
tenth
,
or
ninth
,
or
any
other
number
?
<EOS>
or
who
desire
you
to
answer
,
provide
you
write
?
 
<EOS>
I
defy
the
D

to
answer
my
letter
:
 
<EOS>
sometimes
there
may
be
one
or
two
thing
I
should
be
glad
you
would
answer
;
but
I
forget
them
,
and
you
never
think
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
love
answering
letter
again
,
if
you
talk
of
answering
.
<EOS>
Answering
,
quotha
!
<EOS>
pretty
answerer
truly
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
pamphlet
you
speak
of
,
and
call
it
scandalous
,
and
that
one
Mr.
Presto
be
say
to
write
it
,
hear
my
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Fie
,
child
,
you
must
not
mind
what
every
idle
body
tell
you
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
lie
,
and
that
the
dog
be
not
cry
it
when
you
say
so
;
come
,
tell
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
you
go
to
St.
Mary
be
<EOS>
so
soon
,
you
will
be
as
poor
as
rat
;
that
place
will
drain
you
with
a
vengeance
:
 
besides
,
I
would
have
you
think
of
be
in
the
country
in
summer
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Stella
,
pippin
produce
plentifully
;
Parvisol
could
not
send
from
Laracor
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
about
half
a
score
,
I
would
be
glad
to
know
whether
they
be
good
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Walls

Donnybrook
with
you
;
why
be
not
she
bring
to
bed
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
well
,
Dingley
,
pray
be
satisfied
;
you
talk
as
if
you
be
angry
about
the
Bishop
's
not
offer
you
convenience
for
the
journey
;
and
so
he
should
.
  
<EOS>
what
sort
of
Christmas
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
have
have
no
Christmas
at
all
;
and
have
it
really
be
Christmas
of
late
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
once
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte
,
and
Catherine
;
and
let
Catherine
get
the
coffee
ready
against
I
come
,
and
not
have
so
much
care
on
her
countenance
;
for
all
will
go
well
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bernage
,
Mr.
Bernage
,
Mr.
Fiddlenage
,
I
have
have
three
letter
from
him
now
successively
;
he
send
no
direction
,
and
how
the
d
#
#
#
#
shall
I
write
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
burn
his
last
,
if
I
have
not
see
Stella
's
hand
at
the
bottom
:
his
request
be
all
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
how
can
I
assist
him
in
buying
?
<EOS>
and
if
he
be
order
to
go
to
Spain
,
go
he
must
,
or
else
sell
,
and
I
believe
one
can
hardly
sell
in
such
a
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
stay
,
and
new
regiment
raise
,
I
would
have
use
my
endeavour
to
have
have
him
remove
;
although
I
have
no
credit
that
way
,
or
very
little
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
the
regiment
go
,
he
ought
to
go
too
;
he
have
have
great
indulgence
,
and
opportunity
of
saving
;
and
I
have
urge
him
to
it
a
hundred
time
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
whenever
it
lie
in
my
power
to
do
him
a
good
office
,
I
will
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
draw
up
this
into
a
handsome
speech
,
and
represent
it
to
him
from
me
,
and
that
I
would
write
,
if
I
know
where
to
direct
to
him
;
and
so
I
have
tell
you
,
and
desire
you
would
tell
him
,
fifty
time
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Madam
Stella
,
I
think
I
can
read
your
long
conclude
word
,
but
you
can
not
read
mine
after
bid
you
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
methink
<EOS>
,
I
mend
extremely
in
my
writing
;
but
when
Stella
's
eye
be
well
,
I
hope
to
write
as
bad
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
I
have
answer
your
letter
,
and
mine
be
an
answer
;
for
I
lay
yours
before
me
,
and
I
look
and
write
,
and
write
and
look
,
and
look
and
write
again
.
 
<EOS>
so
good
-
morrow
,
madam
both
,
and
I
will
go
rise
,
for
I
must
rise
;
for
I
take
pill
at
night
,
and
so
I
must
rise
early
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
why
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
tell
you
how
I
pass
my
time
yesterday
,
nor
bid
you
good
-
night
,
and
there
be
good
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
the
morning
to
Secretary
St.
John
about
some
business
;
he
have
get
a
great
Whig
with
him
;
a
creature
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
who
be
a
go
-
between
to
make
peace
between
the
Duke
and
the
Ministry
:
 
<EOS>
so
he
come
out
of
his
closet
,
and
,
after
a
few
word
,
desire
I
would
dine
with
him
at
three
;
but
Mr.
Lewis
stay
till
six
before
he
come
;
and
there
we
sit
talk
,
and
the
time
slip
so
,
that
at
last
,
when
I
be
positive
to
go
,
it
be
past
two
o'clock
;
so
I
come
home
,
and
go
straight
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
let
me
look
at
his
watch
,
and
I
could
not
imagine
it
above
twelve
when
we
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
bid
you
good
-
night
for
last
night
,
and
now
I
bid
you
good
-
morrow
,
and
I
be
still
in
bed
,
though
it
be
near
ten
,
but
I

<EOS>
I
have
be
so
lazy
and
negligent
these
last

day
that
I
could
not

MD
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
be
not
in
order
,
and
yet
be
not
absolutely
ill
,
but
giddyish
,
and
make
me
listless
;
I
walk
every
day
,
and
take
drop
of
Dr.
Cockburn
,
and
I
have
just
do
a
box
of
pill
;
and
to

day
Lady
Kerry
send
me
some
of
her
bitter
drink
,
which
I
design
to
take
twice
a

better

<EOS>
I

as
I
be
direct

and
hope
the
malignity
will
go
off
;
but
one
fit
shake
me
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
I

of
the
present
Ministry

<EOS>
I

that
this

Mr.

"
fraid

one
letter
from
Presto
reading
,
one
travel
,
and
one
writing
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
box

<EOS>
It

Mr.

Capel

from
Dr.

who
say

and
 
God
know
whether
Mr.
Smyth
will
have
well
success
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
speak
to
him
,
and
I
writ
to
him
with
the
bottle

that
bottle

I
hope
,
will
not
miscarry
:
 
I
long
to
hear
you
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
<EOS>
,
you
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
Presto
's
care
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
negligent
enough
of
everything
but
MD
,
and
I
should
not
have
trust
Sterne
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
shall
not
go
so
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
one
more
tug
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
what
you
say
of
Goodman
Peasly
and
Isaac
,
I
answer
as
I
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
Fie
,
child
,
you
must
not
give
yourself
the
way
to
believe
any
such
thing

only
for
curiosity
,
you
may
tell
me
how
these
thing
be
approve
,
and
how
you
like
them
;
and
whether
they
instruct
you
in
the
present
course
of
affair
,
and
whether
they
be
print
in
your
town
,
or
only
send
from
hence
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine

so
take
your
sorrow
again
,
but
do
not
keep
it
,
fle
it
to
the
dog
.
 
<EOS>
and
do
little
MD
walk
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
at
heart
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
we
have
do
with
the
plague
here
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
very
saucy
in
you
to
pretend
to
have
it
before
your
better
.
 
<EOS>
Your
intelligence
that
the
story
be
false
about
the
officer

to
sell
,
be
admirable
.
 
<EOS>
You

.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
nobody

I

<EOS>
the
account

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
nobody

<EOS>
Poor

<EOS>
Will

<EOS>
Will

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Mr.

say
nothing
of

the
Queen

<EOS>
I
be
overseen

I

to
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
such
a
weight
of
affair
on
him
,
that
he
can
not
mind
all
;
but
he
talk
of
it
three
or
four
time
to
me
,
long
before
I
drop
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
what

be
not
Mrs.

?
 
<EOS>
I
have
hope

and

this
time
.
 
<EOS>
You

at

but
I
do

be
eight
pound

due
from
Hawkshaw
:
 
pray
look
at
his

.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you

good
manager
;
and
that
,
when
I
say
so
,
Stella
will
not
think
I
intend
she
should
grudge
herself
wine
.
 
<EOS>
but
go
to
those
expensive
lodging

some
fund
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
stay
till
I
come
over
,
for
some
reason
.
 
<EOS>
that
Frenchwoman
will
be
grumble
again
in
a
little
time
:
 
and
if
you
be
invite
anywhere
to
the
country
,
it
will
vex
you
to
pay
in
absence
;
and
the
country
may
be
necessary
for
poor
Stella
's
health
:
 
but
do
as
you
like
,
and
do
not
blame
Presto
.
 
<EOS>

.
  
<EOS>
yes

Raymond

he
must
stay
longer
than
he

,
because
he
can
not
settle
his
affair
.

in
the
country
at
some
friend

,
come
to
town
in

in
Herefordshire
.
 
<EOS>
Her

ill

natured
brute
,
and
care

anybody
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord
,
see
how
I
blunder
,
and
leave
two
line
short
;
it
be
that
ugly
score
in
the
paper
that
make
me
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
lie
about
the
story
of
the
fire
,
only
to
make
it
more
odd
.
 
<EOS>
bernage
must
go
to
Spain
;
and
I
will
see
to
recommend
him
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
his
General
,
when
I
see
the
Duke
next
:
 
but
the
officer
tell
me
it
would
be
dishonourable
in
the
last
degree
for
him
to
sell
now
,
and
he
would
never
be
prefer
in
the
army
;
so
that
,
unless
he
design
to
leave
it
for
good
and
all
,
he
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
tell
him
so
,
and
that
I
would
write
if
I
know
where
to
direct
to
him
;
which
I
have
say
fourscore
time
already
.
<EOS>
I
have
rather
anything
almost
than
that
you
should
strain
yourself
to
send
a
letter
when
it
be
inconvenient
;
we
have
settle
that
matter
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
when
I
can
,
and
so
shall
MD
;
and
upon
occasion
extraordinary
I
will
write
,
though
it
be
a
line
;
and
<EOS>
when
we
have
not
letter
soon
,
we
agree
that
all
thing
be
well
;
and
so
that
be
settle
for
ever
,
and
so
hold
your
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
you
shall
have
your
pin
;
but
for
candle
'
end
,
I
can
not
promise
,
because
I
burn
them
to
the
stump
;
besides
,
I
remember
what
Stella
tell
Dingley
about
them
many
year
ago
,
and
she
may
think
the
same
thing
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
Dingley
shall
have
her
hinge
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
poor
dear
Stella
,
how
durst
you
write
those
two
line
by
candlelight
?
<EOS>
bang
your
bone
!
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
this
letter
shall
go
to

morrow
,
I
think
,
and
that
will
be
in
ten
day
from
the
last

young
woman
;
that
be
too
soon
of
all
conscience
:
 
but
answer
your

up
so
quick
,
and
I
do
not
design
to

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
Come

will
you

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
I

day
with
my
neighbour
Vanhomrigh

such
dismal
weather
<EOS>
I
could
not

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

and
will
continue
it
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
to
see
the
Secretary
of
State
,
and
have
engage
him
to
give
a
memorial

behalf
of
Bernage

<EOS>
the
Duke

a
man
that
distinguish
people
of
merit

and
I
will
speak
to
him
myself
;
but
the
Secretary
back
it
will
be
very
effectual
,
and
I
will
take
care
to
have
it
do
to
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
pray
tell
bernage
so
,
and
that
I
think
nothing
can
be
lucky
for
him
,
and
that
I
would
have
him
go
by
all
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
order
it
that
the
Duke
shall
send
for
him
when
they
be
in
Spain
;
or
,
if
he
fail
,
that
he
shall
receive
him
kindly
when
he
go
to
wait
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
Can
I
do
more
?
<EOS>
be
not
this
a
great
deal
?
 
<EOS>
I
now
send
away
this
letter
,
that
you
may
not
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I

a
request
to
the
Duke
,
which
the
Secretary
must
second
,
and
his
grace
must
grant
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
say
he
be
sure
it
be
something
insignificant
,
and
wish
it
be
ten
time
great
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
Secretary
's
house
I
writ
a
memorial
,
and
give
it
to
the
Secretary
to
give
the
Duke
,
and
shall
see
that
he
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
that
his
grace
will
please
to
take
Mr.
Bernage
into
his
protection
;
and
if
he
find
bernage
answer
my
character
,
to
give
him
all
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Masham

Mrs.
Masham

tell
me
my
request
be
reasonable
,
and
they
will
second
it
heartily
to
the

too
:
 
<EOS>

reckon
<EOS>
Bernage

a
very
good
foot
when

go
to
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
pray
tell
him
this

though
perhaps
I
will
write
to
him
before

<EOS>
for
I
suppose

<EOS>
I

but
only
some
little
disorder
towards
it
;
and
I
walk
as
much
as
I
can

<EOS>
Lady
Kerry

where

<EOS>
I

take
Mr.
Harley
into
favour
again
,
and
call
to
see
him
,
but
he
be
not

I
will
use

He

Tatler

<EOS>
It

Hyde
Park

for
,
till
my
head
be

little
settle
,
I
think
it
better
not

it
would
be
so
silly
and
troublesome
to
go
out
sick
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.

<EOS>
I

I

<EOS>
I

day
into
the
City
for
a
walk
,
but
the
person
I
design
to
dine
with
be
not
at
home
;
so
I
come
back
,
and
call
at
Congreve
's
,
and
dine
with
him
and
Estcourt
,
and
laugh
till
six
<EOS>
;
then
go
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
who
be
not

to

;
there
I
stay
till
nine
,
and
we
make
up
our
quarrel
,
and
he
have
invite
me
to
dinner
to
-
morrow
,
which
be
the
day
of
the
week
(
Saturday
)
that
Lord
Keeper
and
Secretary
St.
John
dine
with
him
privately
,
and
at
last
they
have
consent
to
let
me
among

on
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
Atterbury
and
Prior
go

bury
poor
Dr.

.
 
<EOS>
Congreve
's
nasty
white
wine
have
give
me
the
heart
-
burn
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
some
good
walk
in
the

to

,
and
then
go
to
Mr.
Harley
.
<EOS>
Lord

be
get
there
before

,
and
I
chid
him
for
presume
to

on
a
day
when
only
Lord
Keeper
and
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
be
to
be
there
;
but
he
regard
me
not
;
so
we
all
dine
together
,
and
sit
down
at
four
;
and
the
Secretary
have
invite
me
to
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
them
I
have
no
hope
they
could
ever
keep
in
,
but
that
I
see
they
love
one
another
<EOS>
so
well
,
as
indeed
they
seem
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
call
me
nothing
but
Jonathan
;
and
I
say
I
believe
they
would
leave
me
Jonathan
as
they
find
me
;
and
that
I
never
know
a
Ministry
do
anything
for
those
whom
they
make
companion
of
their
pleasure
;
and
I
believe
you
will
find
it
so
<EOS>
;
but
I
care
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
upon
a
project
of
get
five
hundred
pound
,
without
be
oblige
to
anybody
;
but
that
be
a
secret
,
till
I
see
my
dear
MD
;
and
so
hold
your
tongue
,
and
do
not
talk
,
sirrah
,
for
I
be
now
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
have
no
fit
,
but
a
little
disorder
before
dinner
;
yet
I
walk
stoutly
,
and
take
pill
,
and
hope
to
mend
.
 
<EOS>
Secretary
St.
John
would
needs
have
me
dine
with
him
to
-
day
;
and
there
I
find
three
person
I
never
see
,
two
I
have
no
acquaintance
with
,
and
one
I
do
not
care
for
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
leave
them
early
and
come
home
,
it
be
no
day
to
walk
,
but
scurvy
rain
and
wind
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
tell
me
he
have
put
a
cheat
on
me
;
for
Lord
Peterborow
send
him
twelve
dozen
flask
of
burgundy
,
on
condition
that
I
should
have
my
share
;
but
he
never
be
quiet
till
they
be
all
go
,
so
I
reckon
he
owe
me
thirty
-
six
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Peterborow
be
now
get
to
Vienna
,
and
I
must
write
to
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
begin
now
to
be
towards
look
for
a
letter
from
some
certain
lady
of
Presto
's
acquaintance
,
that
live
at
St.
Mary
's
,
and
be
call
in
a
certain
language
,
our
little
MD
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
stay
,
I
do
not
expect
one
these
six
day
,
that
will
be
just
three
week
;
an't
I
<EOS>
a
reasonable
creature
?
 
<EOS>
We
be
plague
here
with
an
October
Club
,
that
is
,
a
set
of
above
a
hundred
Parliament
man
of
the
country
,
who
drink
October
beer
at
home
,
and
meet
every
evening
at
a
tavern
near
the
Parliament
to
consult
affair
,
and
drive
thing
on
to
extreme
against
the
Whigs
,
to
call
the
old
Ministry
to
account
,
and
get
off
five
or
six
head
.
 
<EOS>
the
Ministry
seem
not
to
regard
them
;
yet
one
of
them
in
confidence
tell
me
that
there
must
be
something
think
on
,
to
settle
thing
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
one
great
state
secret
:
 
the
Queen
,
sensible
how
much
she
be
govern
by
the
late
Ministry
,
run
a
little
into
t'other
extreme
,
and
be
jealous
in
that
point
,
even
of
those
who
get
her
out
of
the
other
'
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
Ministry
be
for
gentler
measure
,
and
the
other
Tories
for
more
violent
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Rivers
,
talk
to
me
the
other
day
,
curse
the
paper
call
the
Examiner

for
speak
civilly
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough

this
I
happen
to
talk
of
to
the
Secretary
,
who
blame
the
warmth
of
that
lord
and
some
other
,
and
swear
that
if
their
advice
be
follow
they
would
be
blow
up
in
twenty
-
four
hour
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
reason
to
think
that
they
will
endeavour
to
prevail
on
the
Queen
to
put
her
affair
more
in
the
hand
of
a
Ministry
than
she
do
at
present
;
and
there
be
,
I
believe
,
two
man
think
on
,
one
of
them
you
have
often
meet
the
name
of
in
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>

politic

<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
send
to
desire
me
to
engage
some
lord
about
an
affair
she
have
in
their
house
here
:
 
<EOS>
I
call
to
see
her
,
but
find
she
have
already
engage
every
lord
I
know
,
and
that
there
be
no
great
difficulty
in
the
matter
;
and
it
rain
like
a
dog
;
so
I
take
coach
,
for
want
of
well
exercise
,
and
dine
privately
with
a
hang
-
dog
in
the
City
,
and
walk
back
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
now
long
enough
to
walk
in
the
Park
after
dinner
;
and
so
I
do
whenever
it
be
fair
.
 
<EOS>
this
walking
be
a
strange
remedy
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Prior
walk
,
to
make
himself
fat
,
and
I
to
bring
myself
down
;
he
have
generally
a
cough
,
which
he
only
call
a
cold
;
we
often
walk
round
the
Park
together
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
It
snow
all
this
morning
prodigiously
,
and
be
some
inch
thick
in
three
or
four
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Mr.
Lewis
of
the
Secretary
's
office
at
his
lodging
:
 
<EOS>
the
chairman
that
carry
me
squeeze
a
great
fellow
against
a
wall
,
who
wisely
turn
his
back
,
and
break
one
of
the
side
-
glass
in
a
thousand
piece
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
a
scolding
,
pretend
<EOS>
I
be
like
to
be
cut
to
piece
,
and
make
them
set
down
the
chair
in
the
Park
,
while
they
pick
out
the
bit
of
glass
;
and
,
when
I
pay
them
,
I
quarrel
still
;
so
they
dare
not
grumble
,
and
I
come
off
for
my
fare
;
but
I
be
plaguily
afraid
they
would
have
say
,
"
God
bless
your
honour
,
will
not
you
give
us
something
for
our
glass
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lewis
and
I
be
form
a
project
how
I
may
get
three
or
four
hundred
pound
,
which
I
suppose
may
come
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Smyth
have
bring
you
your
palsy
-
drop
.
 
<EOS>
how
do
Stella
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
begin
more
and
more
to
desire
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
the
three
week
since
I
have
your
last
be
over
within
two
day
,
and
I
will
allow
three
for
accident
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
the
snow
be
go
every
bit
,
except
the
remainder
of
some
great
ball
make
by
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Sterne
be
with
me
this
morning
about
an
affair
he
have
before
the
Treasury
.
 
<EOS>
that
drab
Mrs.
Edgworth
be
not
yet
set
out
,
but
will
infallibly

Monday
:
 
and
this
be
the
third
infallible
Monday
,
and
pox
take
her
!
 
<EOS>
so
you
will
have
this
letter
first
;
and
this
shall
go
to

morrow
;
and
,
if
I
have
one
from
MD
in
that
time
,
I
will
not
answer
it
till
my
next
;
only
I
will
say
,
"

and

LETTER

.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
February
24
,
1710
-
11
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
young
woman
,
I
give
in
my
sixteenth
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Ford
<EOS>
(
it
be
his
Opera
-
day
)
<EOS>
as
usual
;
it
be
very
convenient
to
me
to
do
so
,
for
come
home
early
after
a
walk
in
the
Park
,
which
now
the
day
will
allow
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
on
the
Secretary
at
his
office
,
and
he
have
forget
to
give
the
memorial
about
Bernage
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
;
but
,
two
day
ago
,
I
meet
the
Duke
,
who
desire
I
would
give
it
him
myself
,
which
should
have
more
power
with
him
than
all
the
Ministry
together
,
as
he
protest
solemnly
,
repeat
it
two
or
three
time
,
and
bid
me
count
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
I
verily
believe
bernage
will
be
in
a
very
good
way
to
establish
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
do
no
more
for
him
at
present
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
that
;
and
so
get
you
go
to
bed
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
late
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
the

yesterday
since
I
have
your
last

and
so
now
I
will
be
expect
every

a
pretty
dear
letter
from
my
own
MD
,
and
hope
to
hear
that
Stella

be
much
well
in
her
head
and
eye
:
 
<EOS>
my
head
continue
as
it
be
,
no
fit
,
but
a
little
disorder
every
day
,
which
I
can
easily
bear
,
if
it
will
not
grow
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
<EOS>
on
condition
I
may
choose
my

;
I
invite
Masham
,
Hill

Sir

Stanley
,
and
George
Granville
,
but
they
be
engage
;
and
I
do
it
in
revenge
of
his
have
such
bad
company
when
I
dine
with
him
before
;
so
we
laugh
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
venture
to
go
to
church
to
-
day
,
which
I
have
not

this
month
before
.
<EOS>
Can
you
send

a
good
account
of
Stella
's
health
,
pray
now
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
hope
,
and
better
too
.
 
<EOS>
We
dine
(
say
you
)
at
the
Dean
's
,
and
play
at

,
and

,
that
I
always
tell
Mrs.
Walls
of
)
the
banker
's
son
,
a
pox
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
we
be
so
merry
;
<EOS>
I
vow
they
be
pure
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
lose
a
crown
;
for
you
must
know
I
have
always
hand
tempt
me
to
go
out
,
but
never
take
in
anything
,
and
often

;
be
not
that
hard

Presto

etc

Bernage
his
captain
-
lieutenant
,
that
is
,
a
captain
by
commission
,
and
the
perquisite
of
the
company
;
but
not
captain
's
pay
,
only
the
first
step
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
will
like
it
;
and
the
recommendation
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
trouble

I
warrant

<EOS>
Sir

Fountaine

by
invitation

with
Mrs.

<EOS>
You
say
they
be
of
no
consequence
:
 
<EOS>
why
,
they
keep
as
good
female
company
as
I
do
male
;
I
see
all
the
drab
of
quality
at
this
end
of
the
town
with
them
:
 
<EOS>
I
see
two
Lady
Bettys
there
this
afternoon
;
the
beauty
of
one
,
the
good
-
breeding
and
nature
of
t'other
,
and
the
wit
of
neither
,
would
have
make
a
fine
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Rare
walk
in
the
Park
now
:
 
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
walk
in
the
Green
of
St.
Stephen
?
 
<EOS>
the

there
be
finer
gravel
than
the

<EOS>
what
beast
the
irish

be
,
never

walk
!
  
<EOS>

,
and
Jervas
the

who
be
a
true
epicure
.
 
<EOS>

snug
house
at
St.

and
we
have
the
Queen
's
wine
,
and
such
very
fine
victual
that
I
could
not
eat
it
.
 
<EOS>
three
week
and
three
day
since
my
last
letter
from
MD
;
rare
doing
!
<EOS>
why
,
truly
we
be
so
busy
with
poor
Mrs.
Walls
,
that
indeed
,
Presto
,
we
could
not
write
<EOS>
,
we
be
afraid
the
poor
woman
would
have
die
;
and
it
pity
us
to
see
the
Archdeacon
,
how
concerned
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dean
never
come
to
see
her
<EOS>
but
once
;
but
now
she
be
up
again
,
and
we
go
and
sit
with
her
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
die
the
next
day
after
it
be
bear
;
and
I
believe
,
between
friend
,
she
be
not
very
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Presto
,
you
be
plaguy
silly
tonight
,
and
han't
guess
one
word
right
;
for
she
and
the
child
be
both
well
,
and
it
be
a
fine
girl
,
likely
to
live
;
and
the
Dean
be
godfather
,
and
Mrs.
Catherine
and
I
be
godmother
;
I
be
go
to
say
Stoyte
,
but
I
think
I
have
hear
they
do
not
put
maid
and
married
woman
together
;
<EOS>
though
I
know
not
why
I
think
so
,
nor
I
do
not
care
;
what
care
I
?
<EOS>
but
I
must
prate
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
to
-
day
into
the
City
for
my
health
,
and
there
dine
;
which
I
always
do
when
the
weather
be
fair
,
and
business
permit
<EOS>
,
that
I
may
be
under
a
necessity
of
take
a
good
walk
,
which
be
the
good
thing
I
can
do
at
present
for
my
health
.
 
<EOS>
some
bookseller
have
rake
up
everything
I
writ

Prose
and
Verse

<EOS>
Tooke
pretend
<EOS>
he
know
nothing
of
it

but
I
doubt
he

at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
one
must
have
patience
with
these
thing
;
the
good
of
it
be

I

be
plague
no

<EOS>

,
I

me
his
dependence
be
wholly
on
me
;
but
I
have
absolutely
refuse
to

because
I
have
trouble
him
lately
so
much
with
other
folk

affair
;
and
besides
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Mr.
Harley
tell
me
he
do
not
like
Sterne
's
business
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
serve
him
,
because
I
suppose
MD

have
me

<EOS>
but
,
in
say
his
dependence
lie
wholly
on
me
,
he

and

a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
I

whose
son
Peasley
will
be

<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
yesterday
morning
I
be
at
Mr.
Harley
's
levee
:
<EOS>
he
swear
I
come
in
spite
,
to
see
him
among
a
parcel
of
fool
.
 
<EOS>
My
business
be
to
desire
<EOS>
I
may
let
the
Duke
of
Ormond
know
how
the
affair
stand
of
the
First

.
 
<EOS>
He
promise
to
let
him
know
it
,
and
engage
me
to
dine
with
him
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
every
Saturday
,
Lord
Keeper
,
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
I
dine
with
him
,
and
sometimes
Lord
Rivers
;
and
they
let
in
none
else
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
bring
me
some
letter
into
the
Park
;
among
which
one
be
from
Walls
;
and
t'other
,
<EOS>
yes
,
faith
,
t'other
be
from
our
little
MD
,
N.11
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
the
rest
in
the
Park
,
and
MD
be
in
a
chair
as
I
go
from
St.
James
's
to
Mr.
Harley
;
and
glad
enough
I
be
,
faith
,
to
read
it
,
and
see
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
but
I
will
not
answer
it
these
three
or
four
day
at
least
,
or
may
be
soon
.
 
<EOS>
An't
<EOS>
I
silly
?
<EOS>
faith
,
your
letter
would
make
a
dog
silly
,
if
I
have
a
dog
to
be
silly
,
but
it
must
be
a
little
dog
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
with
Mr.
Harley
till
past
nine
,
where
we
have
much
discourse
together
after
the
rest
be
go
;
and
I
give
him
very
truly
my
opinion
where
he
desire
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
complain
he
be
not
very
well
,
and
have
engage
me
to
dine
with
him
again
on
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
come
home
afoot
,
like
a
fine
gentleman
,
to
tell
you
all
this
.
  
<EOS>
4
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
;
and
after
dinner
he
have
a
note
from
Mr.
Harley
,
that
he
be
much
out
of
order
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
preserve
his
health
!
<EOS>
everything
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
at
present
can
not
go
a
step
without
him
,
nor
the
Queen
neither
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
be
in
Ireland
;
but
the
Ministry
beg
me
to
stay
:
 
however
,
when
this
Parliament
lurry
be
over
,
I
will
endeavour
to
steal
away
;
by
which
time
I
hope
the
first
-
Fruit
business
will
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
this
kingdom
be
certainly
ruin
as
much
as
be
ever
any
bankrupt
merchant
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
peace
,
let
it
be
a
bad
or
a
good
one
,
though
nobody
dare
talk
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
nearer
I
look
upon
thing
,
the
bad
I
like
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
confederacy
will
soon
break
to
piece
,
and
our
faction
at
home
increase
.
 
<EOS>
the
Ministry
be
upon
a
very
narrow
bottom
,
and
stand
like
an
isthmus
,
between
the
Whigs
on
one
side
,
and
violent
Tories
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
They
be
able
seaman
;
but
the
temp
be
too
great
,
the
ship
too
rotten
,
and
the
crew
all
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Somers
have
be
twice
in
the
Queen
's
closet
,
once
very
lately
;
and
your
Duchess
of
Somerset
,
who
now
have
the
key
,
be
a
most
insinuating
woman
;
and
I
believe
they
will
endeavour
to
play
the
same
game
that
have
be
play
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tell
them
of
all
this
,
which
they
know
already
,
but
they
can
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
caution
the
Queen
so
much
against
be
govern
,
that
she
observe
it
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
talk
till
to
-
morrow
upon
these
thing
,
but
they
make
me
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
observe
that
lately
,
after
much
conversation
with
Mr.
Harley
,
though
he
be
the
most
fearless
man
alive
,
and
the
least
apt
to
despond
,
he
confess
to
me
that
utter
his
mind
to
me
give
him
ease
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
continue
out
of
order
,
yet
his
affair
force
him
abroad
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
subject
to
a
sore
throat
,
and
be
cup
last
night
:
 
<EOS>
I
send
and
call
two
or
three
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
he
be
well
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
in
the
City
with
Dr.
Freind
at
a
third
body
's
house
,
where
I
be
to
pass
for
somebody
else
;
and
there
be
a
plaguy
silly
jest
carry
on
,
that
make
me
sick
of
it
.
<EOS>
Our
weather
grow
fine
,
and
I
will
walk
like
camomile
.
 
<EOS>
and
pray
walk
you
to
your
Dean
's
,
or
your
Stoyte
's
,
or
your
Manley
's
,
or
your
wall
'
.
 
<EOS>
but
your
new
lodging
make
you
so
proud
<EOS>
,
you
will
walk
less
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
let
me
go
to
bed
,
sirrah

<EOS>
Mr.
Harley

have
put

a
little
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
call

for
him

<EOS>
Ford

and

on
his
Opera

day
;
so
I
bring
Mr.
Lewis

and

<EOS>
I

Addison

three
week

all
our
friendship
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>

Faith

I
could
find
in
my
heart
,
if
it
be
not
for
one
thing
,
I
have
a
good
mind
,
if
I

<EOS>

<EOS>

and

<EOS>

rogue
.
 
<EOS>
Your

with
Goody
Walls

excuse
enough
:
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
be
mistaken
in
the
sex
,
'
tis
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
yes

I
understand
your
cypher
,
and
Stella
guess

<EOS>

and
so
the
matter

<EOS>
He

a
quarrel
with
me
;
I
say
I
have
another
with
him
,
and
we
return
to
our
friendship
,
and
I
should
think
he
love
me
as
well
as
a
great
Minister
can
love
a
man
in
so
short
a
time
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

pray
God
Almighty

<EOS>
I

Mrs.
Edgworth

last
Monday
se'ennight
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
do
read
the
examiner
,
and
they
be
write
very
finely
,
as
you
judge
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
be
too
severe
on
the
Duke
;
they
only
tax
him
of
avarice
,
and
his
avarice
have
ruin
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
count
upon
all
thing
in
them
to
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
have
say
it
be
not
prior
,
but
perhaps
it
may
be
Atterbury
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Madam
Dingley
,
say
she
,
'
tis
fine
weather
,
say
she
;
yes
,
say
she
,
and
we
have
get
to
our
new
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
I
compute
you
ought
to
save
eight
pound
by
be
in
the
other
five
month
;
and
you
have
no
more
do
it
than
eight
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
be
rid
of
that
squinting
,
blink
Frenchman
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
bill
on
Parvisol
for
five
pound
for
the
half
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
and
must
I
go
on
at
four
shilling
a
week
,
and
neither
eat
nor
drink
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
who
the
Devil
say
Atterbury
and
your
dean
be
alike
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
your
Chancellor
,
nor
his
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
have
a
good
deal
of
learning
,
and
be
a
well
-
wisher
to
be
an
author
:
 
<EOS>
your
Chancellor
be
an
excellent
man
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Patrick
's
bird
,
he
buy
him
for
his
tameness
,
and
be
grow
the
wild
I
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
His
wing
have
be
quille
thrice
,
and
be
now
up
again
:
 
he
will
be
able
to
fly
after
us
to
Ireland
,
if
he
be
willing
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Mrs.
Stella
,
Dingley
write
more
like
Presto
than
you
;
for
all
you
superscribe
the
letter
,
as
who
should
say
,
why
should
not
I
write
like
our
presto
as
well
as
Dingley
?
 
<EOS>
You
with
your
awkward
ss
<EOS>
;
can
not
you
write
them
thus
,
SS
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
but
always
SSS
.
 
<EOS>
spiteful
slut
,
to
affront
Presto
's
writing
<EOS>
;
as
that
when
you
shut
your
eye
you
write
most
like
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
time
when
I
do
not
write
to
you
half
so
plain
as
I
do
now
;
but
I
take
pity
on
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
concerned
for
Mrs.
Walls
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Walls
say
nothing
of
it
to
me
in
his
letter
date
after
yours
.
<EOS>
You
say
,
"
if
she
recover
,
she
may
lose
her
sight
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
be
in
no
danger
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Ford
be
as
sober
as
I
please
:
 
<EOS>
I
use
him
to
walk
with
me
as
an
easy
companion
,
always
ready
for
what
I
please
,
when
I
be
weary
of
business
and
Ministers
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
go
to
a
Coffee
-
house
twice
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
regular
in
go
to
sleep
before
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
you
say
that
Stella
be
a
pretty
girl
;
and
so
she
be
,
and
methink
<EOS>
I
see
her
just
now
as
handsome
as
the
day
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
what
?
<EOS>
when
I
be
write
in
our
language
,
I
make
up
my
mouth
just
as
if
I
be
speak
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
catch
myself
at
it
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
Dingley
be
so
fair
and
so
fresh
as
a
lass
in
May
,
and
have
her
health
,
and
no
spleen

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
Poor
Stella

not
Dingley

to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
;
and
the
Dean
may
tell
you
the
particular
from
the
Archbishop
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
sorry
way
to
write
,
but
think
it
may
be
proper
to
send
a
true
account
of
the
fact
;
for
you
will
hear
a
thousand
lie
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
It

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I
take
a
chair
to
Mr.
Harley
,
who
be
asleep
,
and
they
hope
in
no
danger
;
but
he
have
be
out
of
order
,
and
be
so
when
he
come
abroad
to
-
day
,
and
it
may
put
him
in

<EOS>
Mr.

;
but
he

,
and
the

of
his

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
from
Mr.
Walls
,
and
one
from
Mr.
Bernage
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
them
here
,
not
have
time
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
 
Walls
write
about
three
thing
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
about
a
hundred
pound
from
Dr.
Raymond
,
of
which
I
hear
nothing
,
and
it
be
now
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
about
Mr.
Clements
:
 
I
can
do
nothing
in
it
,
because
I
be
not
to
mention
Mr.
Pratt
;
and
I
can
not
recommend
without
know
Mr.
Pratt
's
objection
,
whose
relation
clement
be
,
and
who
bring
him
into
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
third
be
about
my
be
godfather
to
the
child
:
 
<EOS>
that
be
in
my
power
,
and
(
since
there
be
no
remedy
)
will
submit
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
hinder
it
;
but
if
it
can
not
be
help
,
pay
what
you
think
proper
,
and
get
the
Provost
to
stand
for
me
,
and
let
his
christian
name
be
Harley
,
in
honour
of
my
friend
,
now
lie
stab
and
doubtful
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Bernage
,
he
write
me
word
that
his
colonel
have
offer
to
make
him
captain
-
lieutenant
for
a
hundred
pound
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
such
a
fool
to
offer
him
money
without
write
to
me
till
it
be
do
,
though
I
have
have
a
dozen
letter
from
him
;
and
then
he
desire
I
would
say
nothing
of
this
,
for
fear
his
colonel
should
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
People
be
mad
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
engage
Colonel
Disney
,
who
be
one
of
his
solicitor
to
the
Secretary
,
and
then
tell
him
the
story
.
 
<EOS>
He
assure
me
that
field
(
Bernage
's
colonel
)
say
he
may
have
get
that
sum
;
but
,
on
account
of
those
great
recommendation
he
have
,
would
give
it
him
for
nothing
:
 
and
I
would
have
bernage
write
him
a
letter
of
thank
,
as
of
a
thing
give
him
for
nothing
,
upon
recommendation
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Disney
tell
me
he
will
again
speak
to
fielding
,
and
clear
up
this
matter
;
then
I
will
write
to
Bernage
.
 
<EOS>
a
pox
on
him
for
promise
money
till
I
have
it
promise
to
me
;
and
then
make
it
such
a
ticklish
point
,
that
one
can
not
expostulate
with
the
colonel
upon
it
:
 
but
let
him
do
as
I
say
,
and
there
be
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
engage
the
Secretary
of
State
in
it
;
and
be
sure
it
be
mean
a
kindness
to
me
,
and
that
no
money
should
be
give
,
and
a
hundred
pound
be
too
much
in
a
Smithfield
bargain
,
as
a
major
-
general
tell
me
,
whose
opinion
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
now
hurried
,
and
can
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
etc
.
<EOS>
etc
.
  
<EOS>
how
shall
I
superscribe
to
your
new
lodging
,
pray
,
madams
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
but

impudence
and

face

<EOS>
be
not

LONDON

11
.
  
<EOS>
pretty
little
MD
must
expect
little
from
me
till
Mr.
Harley
be
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
We
hope
he
be
so
now
;
but
I
be
subject
to
fear
for
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
head
full
of
the
whole
business
of
the
nation
,
be
out
of
order
when
the
villain
stab
him
,
and
have
a
cruel
contusion
by
the
second
blow
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
go
on
well
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
this

Mr.

and
I
meet
at
Court
,
where
he
go
to
the
Queen
,
who
be
out
of
order
,
and
aguish
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
the
bad
for
this
accident
to
Mr.
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
together
to
his
house
,
and
his
wound
look
well
,
and
he
be
not
feverish
at
all
,
and
I
think
it
be
foolish
in
me
to
be
so
much
in
pain
as
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
penknife
in
my
hand
,
which
be
break
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
the
handle
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
to
write
and
publish
an
account
of
all
the
particularity
of
this
fact
:
 
<EOS>
it
will
be
very
curious
,
and
I
would
do
it
when
Mr.
Harley
be
past
danger
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
be
in
terrible
pain
to
-
day
about
Mr.
Harley
,
who
never
sleep
last
night
,
and
have
be
very
feverish
.
 
<EOS>
but
this

I
call
there
;
and
young
Mr.
Harley
(
his
only
son
)
tell
me
he
be
now
much
well
,
and
be
then
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
They
let
nobody
see
him
,
and
that
be
perfectly
right
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
can
not
go
on
till
he
be
well
,
and
be
force
to
adjourn
their
money
business
,
which
none
<EOS>
but
he
can
help
them
in
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
God
preserve
him
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Mr.

be
well
to

day
,
sleep
well
all
night
,

a
little
out
of
our
fear
.
 
<EOS>
I

three
or
four
time
every

.
 
<EOS>
I
go

and
come

<EOS>
It

He

I

<EOS>
I

Mr.

abundance
of
extravasate
blood
come
from
his
breast
out
of
his
wound
,
and
will
not
be
well
so
soon
as
we
expect
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
say
,
but
can
not
call
it
to
mind
.
 
<EOS>
(
what
be
it
?
)
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

to
-
day
at
court
to
look
for
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
and
give
him
the
memorial
about
Bernage
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
go
with
the
first
fair
wind
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
him
,
but
I
have
give
the
memorial
to
another
to
give
him
;
and
,
however
,
it
shall
be
send
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Bernage
have
make
a
blunder
in
offer
money
to
his
colonel
without
my
advice
;
however
,
he
be
make
captain
-
lieutenant
,
only
he
must
recruit
the
company
,
which
will
cost
him
forty
pound
,
and
that
be
cheap
than
an
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
,
and
stay
till
seven
,
but
would
not
drink
his
champagne
and
burgundy
,
for
fear
of
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
My
shin
mend
,
but
be
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
by
the
time
I
send
this
letter
,
next
Saturday
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
-
day
into
the
City
,
but
in
a
coach
,
and
sosse
up
my
leg
on
the
seat
;
and
as
I
come
home
,
I
go
to
see
poor
Charles
Barnard
's
book
,
which
be
to
be
sell
by
auction
,
and
I
itch
to
lay
out
nine
or
ten
pound
for
some
fine
edition
of
fine
author
.
 
<EOS>
but
'
tis
too
far
,
and
I
shall
let
it
slip
,
as
I
usually
do
all
such
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
in
a
coffee
-
house
with
Stratford
upon
chop
and
some
of
his
wine
.
 
<EOS>
where
do
MD
dine
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
poor
MD
dine
at
home
to
-
day
,
because
of
the
Archbishop
,
and
they
could
not
go
abroad
,
and
have
a
breast
of
mutton
and
a
pint
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Mrs.
Walls
mend
;
and
pray
give
me
an
account
what
sort
of
godfather
I
make
,
and
whether
I
behave
myself
handsomely
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Argyle
be
go
;
and
whether
he
have
my
memorial
,
I
know
not
,
till
I
see
Dr.
Arbuthnot
,
to
whom
I
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
hard
name
belong
to
a
Scotch
doctor
,
an
acquaintance
of
the
Duke
's
and
me
;
Stella
can
not
pronounce
it
.
 
<EOS>
oh
that
we
be
at
Laracor
this
fine
day
!
<EOS>
the
willow
begin
to
peep
,
and
the
quick
to
bud
.
 
<EOS>
My
dream
be
out
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
-
dream
last
night
that
I
eat
ripe
cherry
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
they
begin
to
catch
the
pike
,
and
will
shortly
the
trout
(
pox
on
these
Ministers
!
)
 
<EOS>
and
I
would
fain
<EOS>
know
whether
the
flood
be
ever
so
high
as
to
get
over
the
holly
bank
or
the
river
<EOS>
walk
;
if
so
,
then
all
my
pike
be
go
;
but
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
ask
Parvisol
these
thing
,
sirrah
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
my
canal
,
and
trout
,
and
whether
the
bottom
be
fine
and
clear
?
 
<EOS>
but
harkee
,
ought
not
Parvisol
to
pay
in
my
last
year
's
rent
and
arrear
out
of
his
hand
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
think
,
if
either
of
you
have
head
to
take
his
account
,
it
should
be
pay
in
to
you
;
otherwise
to
Mr.
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
an
order
on
t'other
side
;
and
do
as
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
world
of
business
;
but
I
must
go
sleep
<EOS>
,
I
be
drowsy
;
and
so
goodnight
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
this
sore
shin
ruin
me
in
coach
-
hire
;
no
less
than
two
shilling
to
-
day
go
and
come
from
the
City
,
where
I
dine
with
one
you
never
hear
of
,
and
pass
an
insipid
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
this
post
to
bernage
,
with
the
account
I
tell
you
above
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
like
it
;
'
tis
his
own
fault
,
or
it
would
have
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
your
next
letter
will
be
full
of
Mr.
Harley
's
stabbing
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
mend
,
but
abundance
of
extravasate
blood
have
come
out
of
the
wound
:
he
keep
his
bed
,
and
see
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
the
Speaker
's
eld
son
be
just
dead
of
the
smallpox
,
and
the
House
be
adjourn
a
week
,
to
give
him
time
to
wipe
off
his
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
very
handsomely
do
;
but
I
believe
one
reason
be
,
that
they
want
Mr.
Harley
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
Biddy
Floyd
be
like
to
do
well
:
 
and
so
go
to
your
Dean
's
,
and
roast
his
orange
,
and
lose
your
money
,
do
so
,
you
saucy
slut
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
,
you
lose
three
shilling
and
fourpence
t'other

at
Stoyte

,
yes

you
do
,
and
Presto
stand
in
a
corner
,
and
see
you
all
the
while
,
and
then
steal
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
dream
very
often
<EOS>
I
be
in
Ireland
,
and
that
I
have
leave
my
clothe
and
thing
behind
me
,
and
have
not
take
leave
of
anybody
;
and
that
the
Ministry
expect
me
tomorrow
,
and
such
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
a
guinea
have
a
letter
from
you
till
this
go
;
and
go
it
shall
on
Saturday
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
to
save
my
shin
,
and
then
go
on
some
business
to
the
Secretary
,
and
he
be
not
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
what

Darteneuf

the

and
that
everybody

and
that
know
where
a
knot
of
rabble
be
go
on
a
holiday
,
and
when
they
be
there
last
:
 
and
<EOS>
then
I
go
to
the
Coffee
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
My
shin
mend
,
but
be
not
quite
heal
:
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
keep
it
up
,
but
I
do
not
<EOS>
;
I
e'en
let
it
go

<EOS>
Pox

<EOS>
if

get
towards
it
,
I
will
neither
receive

so
let
Parvisol
know
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
I
this
day
appoint
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
meet
him
at
Ned
Southwell

about
an

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
I
find

hear
of
the
fact
by

<EOS>
I
dine

Sir
John
Perceval

see
his

in
the
form
of
a

<EOS>
It

house
to
see
whether
there
be
a
letter
from
MD
before
I
send
away
mine

but
,
faith
,
I
do
it
on
purpose
,
because
I
would
scorn
to
answer
two
letter
of
yours
successively
.
 
<EOS>
this
way
of
journal
be
the
bad
in
the
world
for
writing
of

,
unless

do
it
the
last
day
;
and
so
I
will
observe
henceforward
,
if
there

or

worth
send

<EOS>
just
three
week

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
have
lose
one
by
the
packet
that

that
will
vex
me
,
consider
the
pain
MD
take
to
write
,
especially
poor
pretty
Stella
,
and
her
weak
eye
.
<EOS>
God
bless
them
and
the
owner
,
and
send
them
well
,
and
little
me

I
hope
ere

<EOS>
this

of
Mr.

put
everything
backwards

to
be
so
,
by
that
extravasate
blood
which
come
from
his

to
the
wound
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
by
the
second
blow
Guiscard

him
after
the
penknife
be
break
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
shock
at
that
villainy
whenever
I
think
of
it

<EOS>
Biddy
Floyd

but

<EOS>
I

that
Mrs.

could
contrive
to
put
up
my
book
in
box
,
and
lodge
them
in
some
safe
place
,
and
you

.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
rise

<EOS>
at

.
 
<EOS>
so
I
visit
and
dine
as

and

<EOS>
We

let
Guiscard
be
bury

last
,
after
show
him
pickle
in
a
trough
this
fortnight
for
twopence
apiece
:
 
and
the

and
,
"

this

the
wound
that

give
him
by
his
grace
the
Duke
of
Ormond

and
this

wound
,
"
etc
.
,
and
then
the
show
be
over
,
and
another
set
of
rabble
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
'
tis
hard
our
law
would
not
suffer
us
to
hang
his
body
in
chain
,
because
he
be
not
try
;
and
in
the
eye
of
our
law
every
man
be
innocent
till
then
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
be
still
very
weak

never

<EOS>

We

four
day
together
.
 
<EOS>
all
thing
be
at
a
stop

Parliament
for
want
of
Mr.
Harley
;
they
can
not
stir
an
inch
without
him
in
their
most
material
affair
:
 
and
we
fear
,
by
the
caprice
of
Radcliffe
,
who
will
admit
none
but
his
own
surgeon
,
he
have
not
be
well
look
after

Brazil
tobacco
have
not

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
o

an
impudent
saucy
couple
of
sluttikin
for
presume
to
write
so
soon
,
say
I
to
myself
this
morning
;
who
know
but
there
may
be
a
letter
from
MD
at
the
Coffee
-
house
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
you
must
know
,
and
so
,
I
just
now
send
Patrick
,
and
he
bring
me
three
letter
,
but
not
one
from
MD
,
no
indeed
,
for
I
read
all
the
superscription
;
and
not
one
from
MD
.
 
<EOS>
one
<EOS>
I
open
<EOS>
,
it
be
from
the
Archbishop
;
t'other
I
open
,
it
be
from
Staunton
;
the
third
I
take
,
and
look
at
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
whose
hand
be
this
?
<EOS>
say
I
;
yes
,
say
I
,
whose
hand
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
wax
between
the
fold
;
then
I
begin
to
suspect
;
then
I
peep
;
faith
,
it
be
Walls
's
hand
after
all
:
 
<EOS>
then
I
open
it
in
a
rage
,
and
then
it
be
little
MD
's
hand
,
dear
,
little
,
pretty
,
charming
MD
's
sweet
hand
again
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord
,
an't
here
<EOS>
a
clutter
and
a
stir
,
and
a
bustle
?
<EOS>
never
see
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
I
believe
yours
lie
some
day
at
the
post
-
office
,
and
that
it
come
before
my
eighteenth
go
,
but
that
I
do
not
expect
it
,
and
I
hardly
ever
go
there
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
you
think
I
will
answer
this
letter
now
;
no
,
faith
,
and
so
I
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
you
wait
,
young
woman
;
but
I
will
inquire
immediately
about
poor
Dingley
's
exchequer
trangum
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
be
that
Vedel
again
a
soldier
?
<EOS>
be
he
break
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
put
it
in
Ben
Tooke
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Vedel
could
not
sell
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
Vedel
,
Vedel
,
poh
,
pox
,
I
think
it
be
Vedeau
;
ay
,
Vedeau
,
now
I
have
it
;
let
me
see
,
do
you
name
him
in
yours
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Mr.
John
Vedeau
be
the
brother
;
but
where
do
this
brother
live
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
fast
-
day
for
the
public
;
so
I
dine
late
with
Sir
Matthew
Dudley
,
whom
I
have
not
be
with
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
that
must
lose
his
employment
whenever
the
great
shake
come
;
and
I
can
not
contribute
to
keep
him
in
,
though
I
have
drop
word
in
his
favour
to
the
Ministry
;
but
he
be
too
violent
<EOS>
a
Whig
,
and
friend
to
the
Lord
Treasurer
,
to
stay
in
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
odd
to
think
how
long
they
let
those
people
keep
their
place
;
but
the
reason
be
,
they
have
not
enough
to
satisfy
all
expecter
,
and
so
they
keep
them
all
in
hope
,
that
they
may
be
good
boy
in
the
meantime
;
and
thus
the
old
one
hold
in
still
.
 
<EOS>
the
Comptroller
tell
me
that
there
be
eight
people
expect
his
staff
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
after
dinner
to
-
day
round
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
do
I
write
politic
to
little
young
woman
?
 
<EOS>
hold
your
tongue
,
and
go
to
your
Dean
's
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
a
fine
day
,
I
will
walk
into
the
city
,
and
see
Charles
Barnard
's
library
.
 
<EOS>
what
care
I
for
your
letter
,
saucy
N.12
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
to
it
yet
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
I
believe
this
will
be
full
before
its
time
,
and
then
go
it
must
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
always
write
once
a
fortnight
;
and
if
it
go
sooner
by
fill
sooner
,
why
,
then
there
be
so
much
clear
gain
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow

,
rogue
and
lass
both
,
I
can
not
lie
scribble
here
in
bed
for
your

<EOS>
Your

but

of
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
grow
very
ugly
and
pimple
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
he
be
a
gamester
,
and
win
money
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
I
help
it
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
Patrick
snuff
the
candle
too
short
,
and
the
grease
run
down
upon
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
It
an't
my
fault
,
'
tis
Patrick
's
fault
;
pray
now
do
not
blame
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
today
in
the
City
,
and
dine
at
a
private
house
,
and
go
to
see
the
auction
of
poor
Charles
Barnard
's
book
;
they
be
in
the
middle
of
the
physic
book
,
so
I
buy
none
;
and
they
be
so
dear
,
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
buy
none
,
and
there
be
an
end
;
and
go
to
Stoyte
's
,
and
I
will
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
Good
Friday
,
you
must
know
;
and
I
must
rise
and
go
to
Mr.
Secretary
about
some
business
,
and
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
desire
me
to
breakfast
with
her
,
because
she
be
to
intercede
for
Patrick
,
who
be
so
often
drunk
and
quarrelsome
in
the
house
,
that
I
be
resolve
to
send
him
over
;
but
he
know
all
the
place
where
I
send
,
and
be
so
used
to
my
way
,
that
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
me
;
but
when
I
come
to
Ireland
,
I
will
discharge
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
,
one
of
the
Lords
of
the
Treasury
,
set
me
down
at
my
door
to
-
day
,
see
Patrick
,
and
swear
he
be
a
Teague
-
lander
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
used
to
his
face
<EOS>
,
I
never
observe
it
,
but
think
him
a
pretty
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
<EOS>
and
I
sup
this
fast
-
day
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
afraid
Mr.
Harley
's
wound
would
turn
to
a
fistula
;
but
we
think
the
danger
be
now
past
.
<EOS>
He
rise
every
day
,
and
walk
about
his
room
,
and
we
hope
he
will
be
out
in
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
prior
show
me
a
handsome
paper
of
verse
he
have
writ
on
Mr.
Harley
's
accident
:
 
<EOS>
they
be
not
out
;
I
will
send
them
to
you
,
if
he
will
give
me
a
copy
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
to
make
April
fool
this
year
<EOS>
,
now
it
happen
on
Sunday
?
 
<EOS>
Patrick
bring
word
that
Mr.
Harley
still
mend
,
and
be
up
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
see
him

a
few
day
:
 
<EOS>
and
he
bring
me
word
too
that
he
have
find
out
Vedeau
's
brother
's
shop
:
 
<EOS>
I
shall
call
there
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
It
seem
the
wife
lodge
next
door
to
the
brother
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
the
scoundrel
be
broke
,
and
get
a
commission
,
or
perhaps
be
a
volunteer
gentleman
,
and
expect
to
get
one
by
his
valour
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrah
,
let
me
rise
.
 
<EOS>
at

<EOS>
Mansel
ask
where
we
dine
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
,
"

.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
we
should
dine
with
him
,
only
his
wife
desire
him
to
bring
nobody
,
because
she
have
only
a
leg
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
dine
with
him
to
choose
;
but
he
would
send
a
servant
to
order
a
plate
or
two
:
 
yet
this
man
have
ten
thousand
pound
a
year
in
land
,
and
be
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
and
be
not
covetous
neither
,
but
run
out
merely
by
slattere
and
negligence
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
dinner
I
ever
see
at
the
Dean
's
be
well
:
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
be

here
.
 
<EOS>
I

at
Mr.
Harley

who
begin

a
stick
,
but

weak
.
 
<EOS>
see
how

ugly
grease
.
 
<EOS>
'
tis

who
seem
terribly
down

melancholy
,
which
Mr.

well
as

<EOS>
perhaps

;
perhaps

it
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
my

<EOS>
Lewis

<EOS>

the
answer
to
this
letter
of
MD

?
 
<EOS>

<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
to
see
Mrs.
Barton
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
better
than
anybody
here
,
and
see
her
seldomer
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
really
now
,
so
it
often
happen
in
the
world
,
that
where
one
love
a
body
good
 
pshah
,
pshah
,
you
be
so
silly
with
your
moral
observation
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
she
tell
me
a
very
good
story
.
 
<EOS>
an
old
gentlewoman
die
here
two
month
ago
,
and
leave
in
her
will
,
to
have
eight
man
and
eight
maid
bearer
,
who
should
have
two
guinea
apiece
,
ten
guinea
to
the
parson
for
a
sermon
,
and
two
guinea
to
the
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
but
bearer
,
parson
,
and
clerk
must
be
all
true
virgin
;
and
not
to
be
admit
till
they
take
their
oath
of
virginity
:
 
<EOS>
so
the
poor
woman
still
lie
unburied
,
and
so
must
do
till
the
general
resurrection
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
at
Mr.
Secretary
's
,
to
see
what
the
D
#
#
#
#
ail
him
on
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
him
a
very
proper
speech
;
tell
him
I
observe
he
be
much
out
of
temper
;
that
I
do
not
expect
he
would
tell
me
the
cause
,
but
would
be
glad
to
see
he
be
in
better
;
and
one
thing
I
warn
him
of
,
never
to
appear
cold
to
me
,
for
I
would
not
be
treat
like
a
schoolboy
;
that
I
have
feel
too
much
of
that
in
my
life
already
(
mean
from
Sir
William
Temple
)
;
that
I
expect
every
great
Minister
who
honour
me
with
his
acquaintance
,
if
he
hear
or
see
anything
to
my
disadvantage
,
would
let
me
know
it
in
plain
word
,
and
not
put
me
in
pain
to
guess
by
the
change
or
coldness
of
his
countenance
or
behaviour
;
for
it
be
what
I
would
hardly
bear
from
a
crown
head
,
and
I
think
no
subject
's
favour
be
worth
it
;
and
that
I
design
to
let
my
Lord
Keeper
and
Mr.
Harley
know
the
same
thing
,
that
they
may
use
me
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
all
right
;
say
I
have
reason
;
vow
nothing
ail
him
but
sit
up
whole
night
at
business
,
and
one
night
at
drinking
;
would
have
have
me
dine
with
him
and
Mrs.
Masham
's
brother
,
to
make
up
matter
;
but
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
but
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
I
be
engage
with
my
old
friend
Rollinson
;
you
never
hear
of
him
before
.
  
<EOS>
4
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
look
a
line
or
two
back
,
and
see
plaguy
mistake
of
the
pen
;
how
do
you
get
over
them
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
puzzle
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
think
what
I
say
to
Mr.
Secretary
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
how
I
use
to
be
in
pain
when
Sir
William
Temple
would
look
cold
and
out
of
humour
for
three
or
four
day
,
and
I
use
to
suspect
a
hundred
reason
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
pluck
up
my
spirit
since
then
,
faith
;
he
spoil
a
fine
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
my
neighbour
Vanhomrigh
,
and
MD
,
poor
MD
,
at
home
on
a
loin
of
mutton
and
half
a
pint
of
wine
,
and
the
mutton
be
raw
,
poor
Stella
could
not
eat
,
poor
dear
rogue
,
and
Dingley
be
so
vexed
;
but
we
will
dine
at
Stoyte
's
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
promise
to
see
me
in
a
day
or
two
,
so
I
call
this
evening
;
but
his
son
and
other
be
abroad
,
and
he
asleep
,
so
I
come
away
,
and
find
out
Mrs.
Vedeau
.
<EOS>
She
draw
out
a
letter
from
Dingley
,
and
say

Morning
.
 
<EOS>
now
let
us
proceed
to
examine
a
saucy
letter
from
one
Madam
MD
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
poor
dear
Stella
,
and
send
her
a
great
many
birthday
,
all
happy
,
and
healthy
,
and
wealthy
,
and
with
me
ever
together
,
and
never
asund
again
,
unless
by
chance
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
find
you
be
happy
or
merry
there
,
it
make
me
so
here
,
and
I
can
hardly
imagine
you
absent
when
I
be
read
your
letter
,
or
write
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
faith
<EOS>
,
you
be
just
here
upon
this
little
paper
,
and
therefore
I
see
and
talk
with
you
every
evening
constantly
,
and
sometimes
in
the
morning
,
but
not
always
in
the
morning
,
because
that
be
not
so
modest
to
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
you
would
fain
palm
a
letter
on
me
more
than
you
send
:
and
I
,
like
a
fool
,
must
look
over
all
your
,
to
see
whether
this
be
really
n.12
,
or
more
.
<EOS>
[
Patrick
have
this
moment
bring
me
letter
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
and
Parvisol
;
my
heart
be
at
my
mouth
for
fear
of
one
from
MD
;
what
a
disgrace
would
it
be
to
have
two
of
yours
to
answer
together
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
faith
,
this
shall
go
to
-
night
,
for
fear
;
and
then
come
when
it
will
,
I
defy
it
.
]
 
<EOS>
no
,
you
be
not
naughty
at
all
,
write
when
you
be
disposed
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
the
Dean
tell
you
the
story
of
Mr.
Harley
from
the
Archbishop
;
I
warrant
it
never
spoil
your
supper
,
or
break
off
your
game
.
 
<EOS>
nor
yet
,
have
not
you
the
box
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
Mrs.
Edgworth
have
the
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
it
now
,
I
suppose
;
and
be
the
chocolate
good
,
or
have
the
tobacco
spoilt
it
?
 
<EOS>
Leigh
stay
till
Sterne
have
do
his
business
,
no
longer
;
and
when
that
will
be
,
God
know
:
 
I
befriend
him
as
much
as
I
can
,
but
Harley
's
accident
stop
that
as
well
as
all
thing
else
.
 
<EOS>
You
guess
,
Madam
Dingley
,
that
I
shall
stay
a
round
twelvemonth
;
as
hope
save
,
I
would
come
over
,
if
I
could
,
this
minute
;
but
we
will
talk
of
that
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
Your
affair
of
Vedeau
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
of
already
;
now
to
the
next
,
turn
over
the
leaf
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
dobbin
lie
,
I
have
no
more
provision
here
or
in
Ireland
than
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
that
Stella
the
conjurer
approve
what
I
do
with
Mr.
Harley
;
but
your
generosity
make
me
mad
;
I
know
you
repine
inwardly
at
Presto
's
absence
;
you
think
he
have
break
his
word
of
come
in
three
month
,
and
that
this
be
always
his
trick
;
and
now
Stella
say
she
do
not
see
possibly
how
I
can
come
away
in
haste
,
and
that
MD
be
satisfied
,
etc
.
<EOS>
an't
you
a
rogue
to
overpower
me
thus
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
to
find
such
friend
as
I
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
indeed
deceive
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
important
reasons[pox
on
this
grease
,
this
candle
tallow
!
]
<EOS>
why
they
should
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
use
barbarously
by
the
late
Ministry
;
I
be
a
little
pique
in
honour
to
let
people
see
I
be
not
to
be
despise
.
 
<EOS>
the
assurance
they
give
me
,
without
any
scruple
or
provocation
,
be
such
as
be
usually
believe
in
the
world
;
they
may
come
to
nothing
,
but
the
first
opportunity
that
offer
,
and
be
neglect
,
I
shall
depend
no
more
,
but
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
say
a
thousand
thing
on
this
head
,
if
I
be
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
think
why
Stella
should
not
go
to
the
Bath
,
if
she
be
tell
it
will
do
her
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
Parvisol
get
up
fifty
pound
,
and
pay
it
you
;
and
you
may
be
good
housewife
,
and
live
cheap
there
some
month
,
and
return
in
autumn
,
or
visit
London
,
as
you
please
:
 
<EOS>
pray
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
Bernage
,
direct
to
Curry
's
<EOS>
;
I
wish
he
have
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
the
bohea
tea
,
if
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Kilmore
,
I
do
not
keep
such
company
;
an
old
die
fool
whom
I
never
be
with
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
no
godfather
;
all
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Stella
,
explain
those
two
word
of
yours
to
me
,
what
you
mean
by
VILLIAN
and
DAINGER
;
and
you
,
Madam
Dingley
,
what
be
CHRISTIANING
?
 
<EOS>
Lay
your
letter
this
WAY
,
this
WAY
,
and
the
devil
a
bit
of
difference
between
this
way
and
the
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
no
;
I
will
show
you
,
lay
them
this
WAY
,
this
WAY
,
and
not
that
WAY
,
that
WAY
.
 
<EOS>
y
ou
shall
have
your
apron
;
and
I
will
put
all
your
commission
as
they
come
,
in
a
paper
together
,
and
do
not
think
I
will
forget
MD
's
order
,
because
they
be
friend
;
I
will
be
as
careful
as
if
they
be
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
do
about
this
Clements
.
 
<EOS>
wall
will
not
let
me
say
anything
as
if
Mr.
Pratt
be
against
him
;
and
now
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
have
write
to
me
in
his
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
this
thing
do
not
rightly
fall
in
my
way
,
and
that
people
never
consider
:
 
I
always
give
my
good
office
where
they
be
proper
,
and
that
I
be
judge
of
;
however
,
I
will
do
what
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
have
the
name
of
a
Whig
,
it
will
be
hard
,
consider
my
Lord
Anglesea
and
Hyde
be
very
much
otherwise
,
and
you
know
they
have
the
employment
of
Deputy
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
frolic
should
take
you
of
go
to
the
Bath
,
I
here
send
you
a
note
on
Parvisol
;
if
not
,
you
may
tear
it
,
and
there
be
an
end
.
<EOS>
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
have
an
imagination
that
the
Bath
will
do
you
good
,
I
say
again
,
I
would
have
you
go
;
if
not
,
or
it
be
inconvenient
,
burn
this
note
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
if
you
would
go
,
and
not
take
so
much
money
,
take
thirty
pound
,
and
I
will
return
you
twenty
from
hence
.
 
<EOS>
do
as
you
please
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
not
be
too
late
for
the
first
season
;
if
it
be
,
I
would
have
you
resolve
however
to
go
the
second
season
,
if
the
doctor
say
it
will
do
you
good
,
and
you
fancy
so

again
about
their
yarn
,
at
Lord
Anglesea
's
desire
;
but
the
business
be
again
put
off
till
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Sir
John
Stanley
,
by
an
assignation
I
have
make
with
Mr.
St.
John
,
and
George
Granville
,
the
Secretary
at
War
;
<EOS>
but
they
let
in
other
company
,
some
lady
,
and
<EOS>
so
we
be
not
so
easy
as
I
intend
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
be
pretty
tolerable
,
but
every
day
I
feel
some
little
disorder
;
I
have
leave
off
snuff
since
Sunday
,
find
myself
much
bad
after
take
a
good
deal
at
the
Secretary
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
let
him
drink
one
drop
of
champagne
or
burgundy
without
water
,
and
in
compliment
I
do
so
myself
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
much
well
;
but
when
he
be
well
,
he
be
like
Stella
,
and
will
not
be
govern
.
 
<EOS>
so
go
to
your
Stoyte
's
,
and
I
will
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
visit
Lady
Worsley
and
Mrs.
Barton
today
,
and
dine
soberly
with
my
friend
Lewis
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dauphin
be
dead
of
an
apoplexy
;
I
wish
he
have
live
till
the
finishing
of
this
letter
,
that
it
may
be
news
to
you
.
<EOS>
Duncombe
,
the
rich
alderman
,
die
to
-
day
,
and
I
hear
have
leave
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
who
marry
his
niece
,
two
hundred
thousand
pound
;
I
hope
it
be
true
,
for
I
love
that
Duke
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
this
evening
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
about
what
I
tell
you
;
and
then
go
to
take
leave
of
poor
Mrs.
St.
John
,
who
give
me
strict
charge
to
take
care
of
the
Secretary
in
her
absence
;
say
she
have
none
to
trust
but
me
;
and
the
poor
creature
's
tear
come
fresh
in
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
take
leave
,
I
be
draw
in
by
the
other
lady
and
Sir
John
Stanley
to
raffle
for
a
fan
,
with
a
pox
;
it
be
four
guinea
,
and
we
put
in
seven
shilling
apiece
,
several
raffle
for
absent
people
;
but
I
lose
,
and
so
miss
an
opportunity
of
show
my
gallantry
to
Mrs.
St.
John
,
whom
I
design
to
have
present
it
to
if
I
have
win
.
 
<EOS>
be
dilly
go
to
the
Bath
?
<EOS>
His
face
will
whizz
in
the
water
;
I
suppose
he
will
write
to
us
from
thence
,
and
will
take
London
in
his
way
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
rabble
will
say
,
"
there
go
a
drunken
parson
"
;
and
,
which
be
bad
,
they
will
say
true
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
but
you
must
know
I
carry
Ford
to
dine
with
Mr.
St.
John
last
Sunday
,
that
he
may
brag
,
when
he
go
back
,
of
dining
with
a
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
go
away
early
,
and
leave
him
drink
with
the
rest
,
and
he
tell
me
that
two
or
three
of
them
be
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
They
talk
of
great
promotion
to
be
make
;
that
Mr.
Harley
be
to
be
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
Lord
Poulett
Master
of
the
Horse
,
etc
.
,
but
they
be
only
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
the
Speaker
be
to
make
Mr.
Harley
a
compliment
the
first
time
he
come
into
the
House
,
which
I
hope
will
be
in
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
an
ill
surgeon
,
by
the
caprice
of
that
puppy
Dr.
Radcliffe
,
which
have
keep
him
back
so
long
;
and
yesterday
he
get
a
cold
,
but
be
well
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
stark
mad
,
to
write
so
much
in
one
day
to
little
saucy
MD
;
here
be
a
deal
of
stuff
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
can
not
you
bid
those
little
dear
rogue
good
-
night
,
and
let
them
go
sleep
,
Mr.
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
when
your
tongue
run
there
be
no
ho
with
you
,
pray
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
again
at
the
lobby
(
like
a
lobcock
)
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
about
your
irish
yarn
,
and
again
put
off
till
Friday
;
and
I
and
Patrick
go
into
the
city
by
water
,
where
I
dine
,
and
then
I
go
to
the
auction
of
Charles
Barnard
's
book
;
but
the
good
one
be
so
monstrous
<EOS>
dear
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
reach
them
,
so
I
lay
out
one
pound
seven
shilling
but
very
indifferently
,
and
come
away
,
and
will
go
there
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Henley
would
fain
engage
me
to
go
with
Steele
and
Rowe
,
etc
.
,
to
an
invitation
at
Sir
William
Read
's
.
 
<EOS>
surely
you
have
hear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
mountebank
,
and
be
the
Queen
's
oculist
;
he
make
admirable
punch
,
and
treat
you
in
gold
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
engage
,
and
will
not
go
,
neither
indeed
be
I
fond
of
the
jaunt
.
 
<EOS>
so
good
-
night
,
and
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
about
noon
to
the
Secretary
,
who
be
very
ill
with
a
cold
,
and
sometimes
of
the
gravel
,
with
his
champagne
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I
scold
him
like
a
dog
,
and
he
promise
faithfully
more
care
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
day
<EOS>
my
Lord
Anglesea
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Hammer
,
and
prior
,
and
I
dine
,
by
appointment
,
with
Lieutenant
-
General
Webb
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
and
I
stay
till
ten
o'clock
;
but
we
drink
soberly
,
and
I
always
with
water
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
with
us
one
Mr.
Campain
,
one
of
the
October
Club
,
if
you
know
what
that
be
;
a
club
of
country
member
,
who
think
the
Ministers
be
too
backward
in
punish
and
turn
out
the
Whigs
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
my
lord
and
the
rest
thought
I
have
more
credit
with
the
Ministry
than
I
pretend
to
have
,
and
would
have
engage
me
to
put
them
upon
something
that
would
satisfy
their
desire
,
and
indeed
I
think
they
have
some
reason
to
complain
;
however
,
I
will
not
burn
my
finger
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
remember
Stella
's
chiding
,
"
what
have
you
to
do
with
what
do
not
belong
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
etc
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
you
will
give
me
leave
to
tell
the
Ministry
my
thought
when
they
ask
them
,
and
other
people
's
thought
sometimes
when
they
do
not
ask
;
so
think
Dingley
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
this
morning
at
Mrs.
Vedeau
be
again
,
who
have
employ
a
friend
to
get
the
money
;
it
will
be
do
in
a
fortnight
,
and
then
she
will
deliver
me
up
the
parchment
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
then
to
see
Mr.
Harley
,
who
I
hope
will
be
out
in
a
few
day
;
he
be
in
excellent
good
humour
,
only
complain
to
me
of
the
neglect
of
Guiscard
's
cure
,
<EOS>
how
glad
he
would
have
be
to
have
have
him
live
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
come
in
to
us
,
and
we
be
very
merry
till
Lord
Chamberlain
(
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
)
come
up
;
then
Colonel
Masham
and
I
go
off
,
after
I
have
be
present
to
the
Duke
,
and
that
we
make
two
or
three
silly
compliment
suitable
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
attend
at
the
House
of
Commons
about
your
yarn
,
and
it
be
again
put
off
.
 
<EOS>
then
Ford
draw
me
to
dine
at
a
tavern
;
it
happen
to
be
the
day
and
the
house
where
the
October
Club
dine
.
<EOS>
after
we
have
dine
,
come
down
<EOS>
we
call
to
inquire
whether
our
yarn
business
have
be
over
that
day
,
and
I
send
into
the
room
for
Sir
George
Beaumont
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
like
to
be
draw
into
a
difficulty
;
for
in
two
minute
out
come
Mr.
Finch
,
Lord
Guernsey
's
son
,
to
let
me
know
that
my
Lord
Compton
,
the
steward
of
this
feast
,
desire
,
in
the
name
of
the
Club
,
that
I
would
do
them
the
honour
to
dine
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
my
excuse
,
adorn
with
about
thirty
compliment
,
and
get
off
as
fast
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
most
improper
thing
for
me
to
dine
there
,
consider
my
friendship
with
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
the
Club
be
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
and
near
eighty
of
them
be
then
go
to
dinner
at
two
long
table
in
a
great
ground
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
at
evening
I
go
to
the
auction
of
Barnard
's
book
,
and
lay
out
three
pound
three
shilling
,
but
I
will
go
there
no
more
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
say
once
before
,
<EOS>
but
now
I
will
keep
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
that
when
I
dine
at
Webb
's
with
Lord
Anglesea
,
I
speak
to
him
of
Clements
,
as
one
recommend
for
a
very
honest
gentleman
and
good
officer
,
and
hope
he
would
keep
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
not
think
otherwise
,
and
that
he
should
certainly
hold
his
place
while
he
continue
to
deserve
it
;
and
I
could
not
find
there
have
be
any
intention
from
his
lordship
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
tell
you
,
hunny
,
the
impropriety
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
man
will
do
a
favour
for
me
,
or
for
my
friend
;
but
why
should
he
do
it
for
my
friend
's
friend
?
 
<EOS>
recommendation
should
stop
before
they
come
to
that
.
<EOS>
let
any
friend
of
mine
recommend
one
of
his
to
me
for
a
thing
in
my
power
,
I
will
do
it
for
his
sake
;
but
to
speak
to
another
for
my
friend
's
friend
be
against
all
reason
;
and
I
desire
you
will
understand
this
,
and
discourage
any
such
trouble
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
this
may
do
some
good
to
Clements
<EOS>
,
it
can
do
him
no
hurt
;
and
I
find
by
Mrs.
Pratt
,
that
her
husband
be
his
friend
;
and
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
say
Clements
's
danger
be
not
from
Pratt
,
but
from
some
other
enemy
,
that
think
him
a
Whig
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
busy
this
morning
that
I
do
not
go
out
till
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
-
day
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
but
say
nothing
of
Bernage
,
who
,
I
believe
,
will
not
see
him
till
Spain
be
conquer
,
and
that
be
,
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
day
at
Lord
Shelburne
's
,
and
speak
to
Mrs.
Pratt
again
about
Clements
;
her
husband
himself
want
some
good
office
,
and
I
have
do
him
very
good
one
lately
,
and
tell
Mrs.
Pratt
I
expect
her
husband
should
stand
by
clement
in
return
.
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dine
with
neighbour
Vanhomrigh
;
he
be
mighty
ill
of
an
asthma
,
and
apprehend
himself
in
much
danger
;
'
tis
his
own
fault
,
that
will
rake
and
drink
,
when
he
be
but
just
crawl
out
of
his
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
this
letter
just
now
,
because
I
think
my
half
-
year
be
out
for
my
lodging
;
and
,
if
you
please
,
I
would
be
glad
it
be
pay
off
,
and
some
deal
box
make
for
my
book
,
and
keep
in
some
safe
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
give
something
for
their
keeping
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
that
lodging
will
not
serve
me
when
I
come
back
;
I
would
have
a
large
place
for
book
,
and
a
stable
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
so
pray
be
so
kind
to
pay
the
lodging
,
and
all
account
about
it
;
and
get
Mrs.
Brent
to
put
up
my
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
no
book
put
in
that
trunk
where
my
paper
be
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
think
of
go
to
the
Bath
,
I
here
send
you
a
bill
on
Parvisol
for
twenty
pound
Irish
,
out
of
which
you
will
pay
for
the
lodging
,
and
score
the
rest
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
do
as
you
please
,
and
love
poor
Presto
,
that
love
MD
better
than
his
life
a
thousand
million
of
time

Farewell

in
her
own
style
,
only
the
first
page

leave
as
I
be
begin
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
of
disoblige
Mr.
Harley
or
Mr.
St.
John
in
one
critical
point
about
it
,
and
so
would
not
do
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
worth
your
reading
,
for
the
circumstance
be
all
true
.
 
<EOS>
My

<EOS>
I

so
out
of
order
with
my
head
this
morning
,
that
I
be
go
to
send
my

my
Lord
Keeper
;
but
however
I

<EOS>
I

.
 
<EOS>
I

a
noble
roll
of

for
grating
,
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
send

<EOS>
My
Lord
Keeper
and
our
this
day
's
company
be
to
dine
on
Saturday
with
George
Granville
,
and
to
-

I

with
Lord
Anglesea
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
such
a
blunder
goosecap
as
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
number
21
at
top
,
and
so
I
go
on
as
if
it
be
the
day
of
the
month
,
whereas
this
be
but
Wednesday
the
18th
.
 
<EOS>
how
shall
I
do
to
blot
and
alter
them
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
a
shift
to
do
it
behind
,
but
it
be
a
great
botch
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Anglesea
to
-
day
,
but
do
not
go
to
the
House
of
Commons
about
the
yarn
;
my
head
be
not
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
be
the
matter
;
it
have
never
be
thus
before
:
 
two
day
together
giddy
from
morning
till
night
,
but
not
with
any
violence
or
pain
;
and
I
totter
a
little
,
but
can
make
shift
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
I
must
fall
to
my
pill
again
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
go
into
the
country
a
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
you
must
do
henceforward
:
 
you
must
enclose
your
letter
in
a
fair
half
-
sheet
of
paper
,
and
direct
the
outside
"
to
Erasmus
Lewis
,
Esquire
,
at
my
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
at
Whitehall
"
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
never
go
to
the
Coffee
-
house
,
and
they
will
grudge
to
take
in
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
your
mother
be
to
see
me
this
morning
,
and
bring
me
a
flask
of
sweet
-
water
for
a
present
,
admirable
for
my
head
;
but
I
shall
not
smell
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
Sheen
,
with
Lady
Giffard
:
 
<EOS>
she
would
fain
send
your
paper
over
to
you
,
or
give
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
say
what
you
would
have
do
,
and
it
shall
be
do
;
because
I
love
Stella
,
and
she
be
a
good
daughter
,
they
say
,
and
so
be
Dingley
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

but
afterwards
send

excuse
,
and
dine
privately
in
my
friend
Lewis
's
lodging
at
Whitehall
,
with
whom
I
have
much
business

relate
to
the

and
Mr.

<EOS>
An't

good
friend
?
 
<EOS>
why
be
not
you
a
young
fellow
,
that
I
may
prefer

?
 
<EOS>
I

a
letter
from
Bernage
from
Kinsale
:
 
<EOS>
he
tell
me

commission
for
captain
-
lieutenant
be
ready
for
him
at
his
arrival
:
 
<EOS>
so

jackanapes
I

.
 
<EOS>
My
head
be
something
well
this
evening
,
though
not
well
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
,
whose
packet
be
just
come
in
,
and
among
them
a
letter
from
Lord
Peterborow
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
he
write
so
well
,
I
have
no
mind
to
answer
him
,
and
so
kind
,
that
I
must
answer
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
Emperor
's
death
must
,
I
think
,
cause
great
alteration
in
Europe
,
and
,
I
believe
,
will
hasten
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
We
reckon
our
King
Charles
will
be
choose
Emperor
,
and
the
Duke
of
Savoy
set
up
for
Spain
;
but
I
believe
he
will
make
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Freind
and
<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
at
a
printer
's
,
and
it
have
cost
me
two
shilling
in
coach
-
hire
,
and
a
great
deal
more
this
week
and
month
,
which
have
be
almost
all
rain
,
with
now
and
then
sunshine
,
and
be
the
true
April
that
I
have
know
these
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
lime
-
tree
in
the
Park
be
all
out
in
leave
,
though
not
large
leave
yet
.
 
<EOS>
wise
people
be
go
into
the
country
;
but
many
think
the
Parliament
can
hardly
be
up
these
six
week
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
be
with
the
Queen
on
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
certainly
he
will
be
Lord
Treasurer
<EOS>
:
I
have
not
see
him
this
week
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
,
and
I
,
and
prior
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
,
have
appoint
to
dine
this
day
with
George
Granville
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
,
I
thank
God
,
be
well
;
but
to
be
giddyish
three
or
four
day
together
mortify
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
no
snuff
,
and
I
will
be
very
regular
in
eat
little
and
the
gentle
meat
.
<EOS>
how
do
poor
Stella
just
now
,
with
her
dean
and
her
Stoytes
?
 
<EOS>
do
they
give
you
health
for
the
money
you
lose
at
ombre
,
sirrah
?
 
<EOS>
what
say
you
to
that
?
<EOS>
Poor
Dingley
fret
to
see
Stella
lose
that
four
and
elevenpence
,
the
other
night
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
rise
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
rise
,
spite
of
your
little
tooth
;
good
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
,
you
be
little
dear
saucyboxe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
just
go
in
the
morning
to
tell
you
that
I
begin
to
want
a
letter
from
MD
,
and
in
four
minute
after
Mr.
Ford
send
me
one
that
he
have
pick
up
at
St.
James
's
Coffee
-
house
;
for
I
go
to
no
coffee
-
house
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
faith
,
I
be
glad
at
heart
to
see
it
,
and
to
see
Stella
so
brisk
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord
,
what
pretend
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
I
will
not
answer
it
yet
;
I
will
keep
it
for
t'other
side
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
we
dine
to
-
day
accord
to
appointment
:
 
Lord
Keeper
go
away
at
near
eight
,
I
at
eight
,
and
I
believe
the
rest
will
be
fairly
fuddle
;
for
young
Harcourt
,
Lord
Keeper
's
son
,
begin
to
prattle
before
I
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
with
Prior
's
lean
carcass
.
 
<EOS>
I
drink
little
,
miss
my
glass
often
,
put
water
in
my
wine
,
and
go
away
before
the
rest
,
which
I
take
to
be
a
good
receipt
for
sobriety
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
put
it
into
rhyme
,
and
so
make
a
proverb
        
Drink
little
at
a
time
;
     
Put
water
with
your
wine
;
     
Miss
your
glass
<EOS>
when
you
can
;
     
and
go
off
the
first
man
.
  
<EOS>
God
be
thank
,
I
be
much
well
than
I
be
,
though
something
of
a
totterer
.
<EOS>
I
eat
but
little
to
-
day
,
and
of
the
gentle
meat
.
 
<EOS>
I
refuse
ham
and
pigeon
,
pease
-
soup
,
stewed
beef
,
cold
salmon
,
because
they
be
too
strong
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
no
snuff
at
all
,
but
some
herb
snuff
prescribe
by
Dr.
Radcliffe
.
       
<EOS>
go
to
your
dean
,
     
You
couple
of
quean
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
say
that
already
.
 
<EOS>
what
care
I
?
 
<EOS>
what
care
Presto
?
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
go
to
the
Secretary
's
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Harley
have
be
out
of
town
this
week
to
refresh
himself
before
he
come
into
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
but
I
must
rise
,
so
there
be
no
more
to
be
say
;
and
so
morrow
,
sirrah
both
.
  
<EOS>
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
the
Secretary
,
who
have
engage
me
for
every
Sunday
;
and
I
be
an
hour
with
him
this
morning
deep
in
politic
,
where
I
tell
him
the
objection
of
the
October
Club
,
and
he
answer
all
except
one
,
that
no
inquiry
be
make
into
past
mismanagement
.
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
I
believe
they
be
not
yet
able
to
make
any
:
 
<EOS>
the
late
Ministry
be
too
cunning
in
their
roguery
,
and
fence
themselves
with
an
Act
of
general
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Mr.
Harley
must
be
Lord
Treasurer
;
yet
he
make
one
difficulty
which
be
hard
to
answer
:
 
<EOS>
he
must
be
make
a
lord
,
and
his
estate
be
not
large
enough
,
and
he
be
too
generous
to
make
it
large
;
and
if
the
Ministry
should
change
soon
by
any
accident
,
he
will
be
leave
in
the
sud
.
 
<EOS>
another
difficulty
be
,
that
if
he
be
make
a
peer
,
they
will
want
him
prodigiously
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
of
which
he
be
the
great
mover
,
and
after
him
the
Secretary
,
and
hardly
any
else
of
weight
.
 
<EOS>
two
shilling
more
to
-
day
for
coach
and
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
expect
an
answer
to
your
letter
,
do
you
so
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
you
shall
have
an
answer
,
you
shall
,
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
good
pun
on
Saturday
to
my
Lord
Keeper
.
 
<EOS>
after
dinner
we
have
coarse
Doiley
napkin
,
fringe
at
each
end
,
upon
the
table
,
to
drink
with
:
 
my
Lord
Keeper
spread
one
of
them
between
him
and
Mr.
Prior
;
I
tell
him
I
be
glad
to
see
there
be
such
a
fringeship
[
friendship
]
between
Mr.
Prior
and
his
lordship
.
 
<EOS>
prior
swear
it
be
the
bad
he
ever
hear
:
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
think
so
too
;
but
at
the
same
time
I
think
it
be
most
like
one
of
Stella
's
that
<EOS>
ever
I
hear
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Lord
Mountjoy
,
and
this
evening
see
the
venetian
Ambassador
come
from
his
first
public
audience
.
 
<EOS>
His
coach
be
the
most
monstrous
,
huge
,
fine
,
rich
gilt
thing
that
ever
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
loiter
this
evening
,
and
come
home
late
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning

visit
the
Duchess
of
Ormond
,
who
have
long
desire
it
,
or
threaten
she
would
not
let
me
visit
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
an
hour
with
her
,
and
we
be
good
company
,
when
in
come
the
Countess
of
Bellamont
,
with
a
pox
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
out
,
and
we
do
not
know
one
another
;
yet
hear
me
name
<EOS>
,
she
ask
,
"
what
,
be
that
Dr.
Swift
?
"
say
she
and
I
be
very
well
acquainted
,
and
fall
a
railing
at
me
without
mercy
,
as
a
lady
tell
me
that
be
there
;
yet
I
never
be
but
once
in
the
company
of
that
drab
of
a
Countess
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dine
with
my
neighbour
Van
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
in
two
day
,
if
possible
,
to
go
lodge
at
Chelsea
for
the
air
,
and
put
myself
under
a
necessity
of
walk
to
and
from
London
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
this
post
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher

long
politic
letter
,
to
entertain
him
.
 
<EOS>
I

with
a
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

but
if
there

and

<EOS>

long
denial
of

yet
have
be
since
assure
to

<EOS>
I
have
send
two
box
of
lumber
to
my
friend
Darteneuf
's
house
,
and
my
chest
of
Florence
and
other
thing
to
Mrs.
Vanhomrigb
,
where
I
dine
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
,
and
show
him
the
Archbishop
's
letter
,
and
convince
him
of
his
grace
's
innocence
,
and
I
will
do
the
same
to
Mr.
Harley
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
here
in
the
stage
-
coach
with
Patrick
and
my
portmanteau
for
sixpence
,
and
pay
six
shilling
a
week
for
one
silly
room
with
confound
coarse
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
such
a
horrible
deal
of
rain
,
that
there
be
no
walking
to
London
,
and
I
must
go
as
I
come
until
it
mend
;
and
besides
the
whelp
have
take
my
lodging
as
far
from
London
as
this
town
could
afford
,
at
least
half
a
mile
farth
than
he
need
;
but
I
must
be
content
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
be
,
I
lodge
just
over
against
Dr.
Atterbury
's
house
,
and
yet
perhaps
I
shall
not
like
the
place
the
well
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
stay
till
to
-
morrow
before
I
answer
your
letter
;
and
you
must
suppose
me
always
write
at
Chelsea
from
henceforward
,
till
I
alter
,
and
say
London
.
 
<EOS>
this
letter
go
on
Saturday
,
which
will
be
just
a
fortnight
;
so
go
and
cheat
goody
Stoyte
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
I
fear
my
whole
chest
of
Florence
be
turn
sour
,
at
least
the
two
first
flask
be
so
,
and
hardly
drinkable
.
 
<EOS>
how
plaguy
unfortunate
be
I
!
<EOS>
and
the
Secretary
's
own
be
the
good
I
ever
taste
;
and
I
must
not
tell
him
,
but
be
as
thankful
as
if
it
be
the
good
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
town
in
the
sixpenny
stage
to
-
day
;
and
hear
Mr.
Harley
be
not
at
home
,
I
go
to
see
him
,
because
I
know
by
the
message
of
his
lie
porter
that
he
be
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
well
,
and
just
go
out
,
but
make
me
promise
to
dine
with
him
;
and
betwixt
that
and
indeed
stroll
about
,
I
lose
four
pound
seven
shilling
at
play
 
with
a####a####a
#
#
#
#
bookseller
,
and
get
but
about
half
a
dozen
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
buy
no
more
book
now
<EOS>
,
that
be
certain
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
dine
at
Mr.
Harley
's
,
come
away
at
six
,
shift
my
gown
,
cassock
,
and
periwig
,
and
walk
hither
to
Chelsea
,
as
I
always
design
to
do
when
it
be
fair
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
sorry
to
find
my
friend
the
Secretary
stand
a
little
ticklish
with
the
rest
of
the
Ministry
;
there
have
be
one
or
two
disoblige
thing
that
have
happen
,
too
long
to
tell
:
 
and
t'other
day
in
Parliament
,
upon
a
debate
of
about
thirty
-
five
million
that
have
not
be
duly
account
for
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
in
his
warmth
of
speech
,
and
zeal
for
his
friend
Mr.
Brydges
,
on
whom
part
of
the
blame
be
fall
,
say
he
do
not
know
that
either
Mr.
Brydges
or
the
late
Ministry
be
at
all
to
blame
in
this
matter
;
which
be
very
desperately
speak
,
and
give
up
the
whole
cause
:
 
for
the
chief
quarrel
against
the
late
Ministry
be
the
ill
management
of
the
treasure
,
and
be
more
than
all
the
rest
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
this
matter
:
 
but
Mr.
Foley
begin
to
discourse
to
-
day
at
table
,
without
name
Mr.
St.
John
<EOS>
,
I
turn
to
Mr.
Harley
,
and
say
if
the
late
Ministry
be
not
to
blame
in
that
article
,
he
(
Mr.
Harley
)
ought
to
lose
his
head
for
put
the
Queen
upon
change
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
it
a
jest
;
but
by
some
word
drop
,
I
easily
see
that
they
take
thing
ill
of
Mr.
St.
John
;
and
by
some
hint
give
me
from
another
hand
that
I
deal
with
,
I
be
afraid
the
Secretary
will
not
stand
long
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
fate
of
Courts
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
if
I
meet
Mr.
St.
John
alone
on
Sunday
,
tell
him
my
opinion
,
and
beg
him
to
set
himself
right
,
else
the
consequence
may
be
very
bad
;
for
I
see
not
how
they
can
well
want
him
neither
,
and
he
would
make
a
troublesome
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
but
enough
of
politic
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
Mr.
Harley
ask
me
yesterday
how
he
come
to
disoblige
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
(
have
not
his
letter
about
me
)
I
tell
him
what
the
Bishop
have
write
to
me
on
that
subject
,
and
desire
I
may
read
him
the
letter
some
other
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
after
all
,
from
what
I
have
hear
from
other
hand
,
I
be
afraid
the
Archbishop
be
a
little
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
one
Brent
Spencer
,
a
brother
of
Mr.
Proby
's
,
who
affirm
it
,
and
say
he
have
leave
to
do
so
from
Charles
Dering
,
who
hear
the
word
;
and
that
Ingoldsby
,
abuse
the
Archbishop
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
now
for
your
saucy
letter
:
 
I
have
no
room
to
answer
it
;
o
yes
,
enough
on
t'other
side
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
no
sicker
?
 
<EOS>
Stella
jeer
Presto
for
not
come
over
by
Christmas
;
but
indeed
Stella
do
not
jeer
,
but
reproach
,
poor
poor
Presto
.
<EOS>
and
how
can
I
come
away
and
the
first
-
fruit
not
finish
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
of
opinion
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Ormond
will
do
nothing
in
them
before
he
go
,
which
will
be
in
a
fortnight
,
they
say
;
and
then
they
must
fall
to
me
to
be
do
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
I
have
nothing
to
print
:
 
<EOS>
you
know
they
have
print
the
Miscellanies
already
.
 
<EOS>
be
they
on
your
side
yet
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
my
snuff
box
,
I
will
have
your
strong
box
.
 
<EOS>
hi
,
do
Stella
take
snuff
again
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
only
because
it
be
a
fine
box
?
 
<EOS>
not
the
Meddle
,
but
the
Medley
,
you
fool
.
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
a
wretched
thing
,
because
it
be
against
you
Tories
:
 
<EOS>
now
I
think
it
very
fine
,
and
the
Examiner
a
wretched
thing
.
 
<EOS>
twist
your
mouth
,
sirrah
.
<EOS>
Guiscard
,
and
what
you
will
read
in
the
Narrative
,
I
order
to
be
write
,
and
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
the
Spectator
be
write
by
Steele
,
with
Addison
's
help
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
often
very
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
yesterday
it
be
make
of
a
noble
hint
I
give
him
long
ago
for
his
Tatlers
,
about
an
Indian
suppose
to
write
his
travel
into
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
repent
he
ever
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
intend
to
have
write
a
book
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
have
spend
it
all
in
one
paper
,
and
all
the
under
-
hint
there
be
mine
too
;
but
I
never
see
him
or
Addison
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
be
well
,
but
I
fear
will
be
no
long
liver
;
for
I
be
tell
she
have
sometimes
the
gout
in
her
bowel
(
I
hate
the
word
bowel
)
.
 
<EOS>
My
ear
have
be
,
these
three
month
past
,
much
well
than
any
time
these
two
year
;
but
now
they
begin
to
be
a
little
out
of
order
again
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
be
well
,
though
not
right
;
but
I
trust
to
air
and
walking
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
get
my
letter
,
but
<EOS>
what
number
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
18
.
 
<EOS>

my
shin
have
be
well

month
.
 
<EOS>

Mrs.
Westley

<EOS>
They
lie
;
Mr.
Harley
's
wound
be
very
terrible
:
he
have
convulsion
,
and
very
narrowly
escape
.
 
<EOS>
the
bruise
be
nine
time
bad
than
the
wound
:
 
he
be
weak
still
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Brooks
marry
;
I
know
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
Mrs.
Walls
's
eye
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
'
tis
better
.
 
<EOS>
o
yes
,
you
be
great
walker
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
hear
them
say
,
"
much
talker
,
little
walker
"
:
<EOS>
and
I
believe
I
may
apply
the
old
proverb
to
you
        
<EOS>
if
you
talk
no
more
than
you
walk
,
     
<EOS>
those
that
think
you
wit
would
be
baulk
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
Stella
shall
have
a
large
print
Bible
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
it
down
among
my
commission
for
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
you
have
take
the
fancy
of
intend
to
read
the
Bible
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
the
box
;
be
not
it
come
yet
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
trust
to
your
young
fellow
,
young
woman
;
'
tis
your
fault
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
such
power
with
Sterne
that
he
would
fly
over
Mount
Atlas
to
serve
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
be
not
splenetic
;
but
if
you
be
,
faith
,
you
will
break
poor
Presto
's
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
the
rest
;
but
I
vow
to
God
,
if
I
could
decently
come
over
now
,
I
would
,
and
leave
all
scheme
of
politic
and
ambition
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
opportunity
here
of
preserve
my
health
by
ride
,
etc
.
,
that
I
have
in
Ireland
;
and
the
want
of
health
be
a
great
cooler
of
make
one
's
court
.
 
<EOS>
You
guess
right
about
my
be
bit
with
a
direction
from
Walls
,
and
the
letter
from
MD
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
describe
it
in
one
of
my
last
.
 
<EOS>
this
go
to
-
night
;
and
I
must
now
rise
and
walk
to
town
,
and
walk
back
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
and
preserve
poor
MD
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
faith
<EOS>
,
do
not
think
,
<EOS>
saucy
nose
,
that
I
will
fill
this
third
side
:
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
stay
a
letter
above
a
fortnight
:
 
<EOS>
it
must
go
then
;
and
you
would
rather
see
a

one
like
this

than
want
it
a

longer

<EOS>
I

and
there

Our

<EOS>
I

I

<EOS>
They
would
not
let
me
in
to
their
dining
-
place
for
want
of
a
ticket
;
and
I
would
not
send

just
for
all
the

as
if

<EOS>
Faith

I
be
very
silly
;
but
I
can
not

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
my
friend
Lewis
,
and
we
be
deep
in
politic
how
to
save
the
present
Ministry
;
for
I
be
afraid
of
Mr.
Secretary
,
as
I
believe
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
the
evening
to
see
Mr.
Harley
;
and
,
upon
my
word
,
I
be
in
perfect
joy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
be
just
go
out
of
the
door
;
but
I
make
him
come
back
,
and
there
be
the
old
Saturday
Club
,
Lord
Keeper
,
Lord
Rivers
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
Mr.
Harley
,
and
I
;
the
first
time
since
his
stabbing
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
go
away
;
but
I
stay
till
nine
,
and
make
Mr.
Harley
show
me
his
breast
,
and
tell
all
the
story
;
and
I
show
him
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
's
letter
,
and
defend
him
effectually
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
in
mighty
good
humour
.
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
and
I
leave
them
together
,
and
I
walk
here
after
nine
two
mile
,
and
I
find
a
parson
drunk
fighting
with
a
seaman
,
and
Patrick
and
I
be
so
wise
to
part
them
,
but
the
seaman
follow
him
to
Chelsea
,
curse
at
him
,
and
the
parson
slip
into
a
house
,
and
I
know
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
mortify
me
to
see
a
man
in
my
coat
so
overtaken
.
 
<EOS>
a
pretty
scene
for
one
that
just
come
from
sit
with
the
Prime
Ministers
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
so
could
not
be
rob
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
nothing
but
Mr.
Harley
shall
make
me
take
such
a
journey
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
yet
know
who
will
be
President
in
Lord
Rochester
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
measure
,
and
find
that
the
penknife
would
have
kill
Mr.
Harley
if
it
have
go
but
<EOS>
half
the
breadth
of
my
thumb
-
nail
<EOS>
lower
,
<EOS>
so
near
be
he
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
curious
as
to
ask
him
what
be
his
thought
while
they
be
carry
him
home
in
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
conclude
himself
a
dead
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
not
allow
that
Guiscard
give
him
the
second
stab
;
though
my
Lord
Keeper
,
who
be
blind
,
and
I
that
be
not
there
,
be
positive
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
plaster
still
as
broad
as
half
a
crown
.
 
<EOS>
smoke
how
wide
the
line
be
,
but
,
faith
,
I
do
not
do
it
on
purpose
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
change
my
side
in
this
new
Chelsea
bed
,
and
I
do
not
know
how
,
methink
,
but
it
be
so
unfit
,
and
so
awkward
,
never
see
the
like
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
You
must
remember
to
enclose
your
letter
in
a
fair
paper
,
and
direct
the
outside
thus
:
 
"
to
Erasmus
Lewis
,
Esq
.
;
at
my
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
so
before
,
but
it
may
miscarry
,
you
know
,
yet
I
think
none
of
my
letter
do
ever
miscarry
;
faith
<EOS>
,
I
think
never
one
;
among
all
the
privateer
and
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
,
my
letter
be
too
good
to
be
lose
.
<EOS>
MD
's
letter
may
tarry
,
but
never
miscarry
,
as
the
old
woman
use
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
how
should
they
miscarry
,
when
they
never
come
before
their
time
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
terrible
rainy
day
;
yet
I
make
a
shift
to
steal
fair
weather
overhead
enough
to
go
and
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
early
with
the
Secretary
,
and
dine
with
him
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
I
begin
to
chide
him
,
and
tell
him
my
fear
of
his
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
but
Arthur
Moore
come
up
and
relieve
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
forget
,
for
you
never
hear
of
Arthur
Moore
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
get
Mr.
Harley
alone
,
I
will
know
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
Dr.
Raymond
over
before
this
letter
,
and
what
care
you
?
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
and
believe
my
walk
every
day
do
me
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
busy
at
home
,
and
set
out
late
this
morning
,
and
dine
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
at
whose
lodging
I
always
change
my
gown
and
periwig
.
 
<EOS>
I
visit
this
afternoon
,
and
among
other
,
poor
Biddy
Floyd
,
who
be
very
red
,
but
I
believe
will
not
be
much
mark
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
be
come
home
,
I
meet
Sir
George
Beaumont
in
the
Pall
Mall
,
who
would
needs
walk
with
me
as
far
as
Buckingham
House
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
him
of
my
head
;
he
say
he
have
be
ill
of
the
same
disorder
,
and
by
all
mean
forbid
me
bohea
tea
,
which
,
he
say
,
always
give
it
him
;
and
that
Dr.
Radcliffe
say
it
be
very
bad
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
have
observe
the
same
thing
,
and
have
leave
it
off
this
month
,
have
find
myself
ill
after
it
several
time
;
and
I
mention
it
that
Stella
may
consider
it
for
her

poor
little
head

<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
tell
me
yesterday
that
Mr.
Harley
would
this
week
be
Lord
Treasurer
and
a
peer
;
so
I
expect
it
every
day
;
yet
perhaps
it
may
not
be
till
Parliament
be
up
,
which
will
be
in
a
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>

encouragement
;
and
desire

a
memorial
to
Ned
Southwell
about
it

which
I
will

and
so
tell
Joe

walk
home
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
to

<EOS>
Mr.

never

to
Court
at
all
;
somebody
there
ask
me
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
"

but
that

<EOS>
he
shall
be

to
me
as
long
as
he
live
.
 
<EOS>
Dick
Tighe
and
I
meet
,
and
never
stir
our
hat
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
to
mistake
him
for
Witherington
,
the
little
nasty
lawyer
that
come
up
to
me
so
sternly
at
the
Castle
the
day
I
leave
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
ask
the
gentleman
I
see
walk
with
him
how
long
Witherington
have
be
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
town
to
-
day
by
water
.
 
<EOS>
the
hail
quite
discourage
me
from
walk
,
and
there
be
no
shade
in
the
great
part
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
the
first
boat
,
and
have
a
footman
my
companion
;
then
I
go
again
by
water
,
and
dine
in
the
City
with
a
printer
,
to
whom
I
carry
a
pamphlet
in
manuscript
,
that
Mr.
Secretary
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
printer
send
it
to
the
Secretary
for
his
approbation
,
and
he
desire
me
to
look
it
over
,
which
I
do
,
and
find
it
a
very
scurvy
piece
.
 
<EOS>
the
reason
I
tell
you
so
,
be
because
it
be
do
by
your
parson
Slap
,
Scrap
,
Flap
(
what
d'ye
call
him
)
,
Trapp
,
your
Chancellor
's
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
call
a
Character
of
the
present
Set
of
Whigs
,
and
be
go
to
be
print
,
and
no
doubt
the
author
will
take
care
to
produce
it
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Freind
be
with
me
,
and
pull
out
a
twopenny
pamphlet
just
publish
,
call
the
State
of
Wit
,
give
a
character
of
all
the
paper
that
have
come
out
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
seem
to
be
a
Whig
,
yet
he
speak
very
highly
of
a
paper
call
the
Examiner
,
and
say
the
suppose
author
of
it
be
Dr.
Swift
.
 
<EOS>
but
above
all
thing
he
praise
the
Tatlers
and
Spectators
;
and
I
believe
Steele
and
Addison
be
privy
to
the
printing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
one
treat
by
these
impudent
dog
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
villain
Curll
have
scrape
up
some
trash
,
and
call
it
Dr.
Swift
's
Miscellanies
,
with
the
name
at
large
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
get
no
satisfaction
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
Mr.
Harley
tell
me
he
have
read
it
,
and
only
laugh
at
me
before
Lord
Keeper
and
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
since
I
come
home
,
I
have
be
sit
with
the
Prolocutor
,
Dean
Atterbury
,
who
be
my
neighbour
over
the
way
,
but
generally
keep
in
town
with
his
Convocation
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis

.
 
<EOS>
My
walk
to
town
to
-
day
be
after
ten
,
and
prodigiously
hot
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Shelburne
,
and
have
desire
Mrs.
Pratt
,
who
lodge
there
,
to
carry
over
Mrs.
Walls
's
tea
;
I
hope
she
will
do
it
,
and
they
talk
of
go
in
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
My
way
be
this
:
 
I
leave
my
good
gown
and
periwig
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
then
walk
up
the
Pall
Mall
,
through
the
Park
,
out
at
Buckingham
House
,
and
so
to
Chelsea
a
little
beyond
the
church
:
 
<EOS>
I
set
out
about
sunset
,
and
get
here
in
something
less
than
an
hour
;
it
be
two
good
mile
,
and
just
five
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
-
eight
step
;
so
there
be
four
mile
a
day
walk
,
without
reckon
what
I
walk
while
I
stay
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
pass
the
Mall
in
the
evening
,
it
be
prodigious
to
see
the
number
of
lady
walk
there
;
and
I
always
cry
shame
at
the
lady
of
Ireland
,
who
never
walk
at
all
,
as
if
their
leg
be
of
no
use
,
but
to
be
lay
aside
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
now
almost
three
week
here
,
and
I
thank
God
,
be
much
well
in
my
head
,
if
it
do
but
continue
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
if
I
be
with
you
,
when
we
go
to
Stoyte
at
Donnybrook
,
we
would
only
take
a
coach
to
the
hither
end
of
Stephen
's
Green
,
and
from
thence
go
every
step
on
foot
,
yes
,
faith
,
every
step
;
it
would
do
DD
good
as
well
as
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
tell
me
I
look
well
already
;
for
,
faith
,
I
look
sadly
,
that
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
My
breakfast
be
milk
porridge
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
love
it
;
faith
,
I
hate
it
,
but
it
be
cheap
and
wholesome
;
and
I
hate
to
be
oblige
to
either
of
those
quality
for
anything
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
Presto
will
be
so
tedious
in
answer
MD
's
letter
;
because
he
would
keep
the
good
to
the
last
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Presto
must
be
humour
,
it
must
be
as
he
will
have
it
,
or
there
will
be
an
old
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
dead
with
heat
;
be
not
you
very
hot
?
 
<EOS>
My
walk
make
my
forehead
sweat
rarely
;
sometimes
my
morning
journey
be
by
water
,
as
it
be
to
-
day
with
one
Parson
Richardson
,
who
come
to
see
me
,
on
his
go
to
Ireland
;
and
with
him
I
send
Mrs.
Walls
's
tea
,
and
three
book
I
get
from
the
Lords
of
the
Treasury
for
the
College
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Shelburne
to
-
day
;
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
be
go
likewise
for
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
forgot
,
I
dine
with
Mr.
prior
to
-
day
,
at
his
house
,
with
Dean
Atterbury
and
other
;
and
come
home
pretty
late
,
and
I
think
I
be
in
a
fuzz
,
and
do
not
know
what
I
say
,
never
see
the
like
.

<EOS>
Sterne
come
here
by
water
to
see
me
this
morning
,
and
I
go
back
with
him
to
his
boat
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
Mrs.
Edgworth
marry
a
fellow
in
her
journey
to
Chester
;
so
I
believe
she
little
thought
of
anybody
's
box
but
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
Sterne
to
give
me
direction
where
to
get
the
box
in
Chester
,
which
he
say
he
will
to
-
morrow
;
and
I
will
write
to
Richardson
to
get
it
up
there
as
he
go
by
,
and
whip
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
direct
to
Mrs.
Curry
:
 
you
must
caution
her
of
it
,
and
desire
her
to
send
it
you
when
it
come
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
say
Jemmy
Leigh
love
London
mightily
;
that
make
him
stay
so
long
,
I
believe
,
and
not
Sterne
's
business
,
which
Mr.
Harley
's
accident
have
put
much
backward
.
 
<EOS>
We
expect
now
every
day
that
he
will
be
Earl
of
Oxford
and
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
His
patent
be
pass
;
but
,
they
say
,
Lord
Keeper
be
not
yet
;
at
least
his
son
,
young
Harcourt
,
tell
me
so
t'other
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
privately
with
my
friend
Lewis
at
his
lodging
at
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
T'other
day
at
Whitehall
I
meet
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
,
whom
I
have
not
see
before
since
I
come
to
England
;
we
be
mighty
glad
to
see
each
other
,
and
she
have
engage
me
to
visit
her
,
as
I
design
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
Mrs.
Colledge
:
 
she
have
lodging
at
Whitehall
,
have
be
seamstress
to
King
William
,
<EOS>
worth
three
hundred
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
be
a
fanatic
joiner
,
hang
for
treason
in
Shaftesbury
's
plot
.
 
<EOS>
this
noble
person
and
<EOS>
I
be
bring
acquaint
,
some
year
ago
,
by
Lady
Berkeley
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
good
creditable
acquaintance
:
 
<EOS>
I
love
to
be
the
bad
of
the
company
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
of
those
that
say
,
"
for
want
of
company
,
welcome
trumpery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
evening
with
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
at
Vauxhall
,
to
hear
the
nightingale
;
but
they
be
almost
past
singe
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
hunt
the
Secretary
to
-
day
in
vain
about
some
business
,
and
dine
with
Colonel
Crowe
,
late
Governor
of
Barbados
,
and
your
friend
Sterne
be
the
third
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
very
kind
to
Sterne
,
and
help
him
in
his
business
,
which
lie
asleep
till
Mr.
Harley
be
Lord
Treasurer
,
because
nothing
of
moment
be
now
do
in
the
Treasury
,
the
change
be
expect
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
with
Dean
Atterbury
till
one
o'clock
after
I
come
home
;
so
'
tis
late
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
about
our
town
we
be
mow
already
and
make
hay
,
and
it
smell
so
sweet
as
we
walk
through
the
flowery
mead
;
but
the
hay
-
make
nymph
be
perfect
drabs
,
nothing
so
clean
and
pretty
as
farther
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
mighty
increase
of
dirty
wench
in
straw
hat
since
I
know
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
at
home
till
five
o'clock
,
and
dine
with
Dean
Atterbury
;
then
go
by
water
to
Mr.
Harley
's
,
where
the
Saturday
Club
be
meet
,
with
the
addition
of
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
.
 
<EOS>
I
whisper
Lord
Rivers
that
I
do
not
like
to
see
a
stranger
among
us
;
and
the
rogue
tell
it
aloud
:
but
Mr.
Secretary
say
the
Duke
writ
to
have
leave
;
so
I
appear
satisfied
,
and
so
we
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
tell
me
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
have
be
talk
to
him
much
about
me
,
and
desire
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
it
could
not
be
,
for
he
have
not
make
sufficient
advance
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
say
he
think
that
Duke
be
not
use
to
make
advance
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
could
not
help
that
;
for
I
always
expect
advance
in
proportion
to
man
's
quality
,
and
more
from
a
duke
than
any
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
reply
that
he
do
not
mean
anything
of
his
quality
;
which
be
handsomely
say
enough
;
for
he
mean
his
pride
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
invent
a
notion
to
believe
that
nobody
be
proud
.
 
<EOS>
at
ten
all
the
company
go
away
;
and
from
ten
to
twelve
Mr.
Harley
and
I
sit
together
,
where
we
talk
through
a
great
deal
of
matter
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
to
settle
with
him
;
and
then
walk
in
a
fine
moonshine
night
to
Chelsea
,
where
I
get
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Rivers
conjure
me
not
to
walk
so
late
;
but
I
would
,
because
I
have
no
other
way
;
but
I
have
no
money
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
by
what
the
Lord
Keeper
tell
me
last
night
,
I
find
he
will
not
be
make
a
peer
so
soon
;
but
Mr.
Harley
's
patent
for
Earl
of
Oxford
be
now
draw
,
and
will
be
do
in
three
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
him
own
it
,
which
he
do
scurvily
,
and
then
talk
of
it
like
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
have
too
much
company
with
him
to
-
day
;
so
I
come
away
soon
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
no
man
liberty
to
swear
or
talk
b####dy
,
and
I
find
some
of
them
be
in
constraint
,
so
I
leave
them
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
merry
Whitsuntide
,
and
pray
tell
me
how
you
pass
away
your
time
;
but
,
faith
,
you
be
go
to
Wexford
,
and
I
fear
this
letter
be
too
late
;
it
shall
go
on
Thursday
,
and
sooner
it
can
not
<EOS>
,
I
have
so
much
business
to
hinder
me
answer
your
.
 
<EOS>
where
must
I
direct
in
your
absence
?
<EOS>
do
you
quit
your
lodging
?
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
go
to
town
this
morning
,
I
meet
in
the
Pall
Mall
a
clergyman
of
Ireland
,
whom
I
love
very
well
and
be
glad
to
see
,
and
with
him
a
little
jackanape
,
of
Ireland
too
,
who
marry
Nanny
Swift
,
Uncle
Adam
's
daughter
,
one
Perry
<EOS>
;
perhaps
you
may
have
hear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
have
send
him
here
,
to
get
a
place
from
Lowndes
;
because
my
uncle
and
Lowndes
marry
two
sister
,
and
Lowndes
be
a
great
man
here
in
the
Treasury
;
but
by
good
luck
I
have
no
acquaintance
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
expect
I
should
be
his
friend
to
Lowndes
,
and
one
word
of
mine
,
etc
.
,
the
old
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
go
two
yard
to
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
where
I
keep
my
good
gown
and
periwig
,
to
put
on
when
I
come
to
town
and
be
a
spark
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
in
the
city
,
and
come
home
this
evening
,
I
meet
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
and
Mr.
Lewis
in
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
Lewis
whisper
me
that
Mr.
Harley
's
patent
for
the
Earl
of
Oxford
be
pass
in
Mr.
Secretary
St.
John
's
office
;
so
to
-
morrow
or
<EOS>
next
day
,
I
suppose
,
he
will
be
declare
Earl
of
Oxford
,
and
have
the
staff
.
 
<EOS>
this
man
have
grow
by
persecution
,
turning
out
,
and
stab
.
 
<EOS>
what
waiting
,
and
crowd
,
and
bowing
will
be
at
his
levee
!
<EOS>
yet
,
if
human
nature
be
capable
of
so
much
constancy
,
I
should
believe
he
will
be
the
same
man
still
,
bate
the
necessary
form
of
grandeur
he
must
keep
up
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
late
,
sirrah
,
and
I
will
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
up
late
last
night
,
and
wake
late
to
-
day
;
but
will
now
answer
your
letter
in
bed
before
I
go
to
town
,
and
I
will
send
it
to
-
morrow
;
for
perhaps
you
may
not
go
so
soon
to
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
you
be
not
out
in
your
number
;
the
last
be
Number
14
,
and
so
I
tell
you
twice
or
thrice
;
will
you
never
be
satisfied
?
 
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
for
poor
Stella
?
 
<EOS>
go
to
Wexford
,
for
God
's
sake
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
be
to
walk
there
by
three
mile
a
day
,
with
a
good
lodging
at
every
mile
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
Walking
have
do
me
so
much
good
,
that
I
can
not
but
prescribe
it
often
to
poor
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
Parvisol
have
send
me
a
bill
for
fifty
pound
,
which
I
be
sorry
for
,
have
not
write
to
him
for
it
,
only
mention
it
two
month
ago
;
but
I
hope
he
will
be
able
to
pay
you
what
I
have
draw
upon
him
for
:
 
<EOS>
he
never
send
me
any
sum
before
,
but
one
bill
of
twenty
pound
half
a
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
welcome
as
my
blood
to
every
farthing
I
have
in
the
world
;
and
all
that
grieve
me
be
,
I
be
not
rich
,
for
MD
's
sake
,
as
hope
save
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
give
up
your
lodging
when
you
go
to
Wexford
;
yet
that
will
be
inconvenient
too
:
 
yet
<EOS>
I
wish
again
you
be
under
a
necessity
of
ramble
the
country
until
Michaelmas
,
faith
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
let
them
keep
the
shelf
,
with
a
pox
;
yet
they
be
exact
people
about
those
four
week
;
or
Mrs.
Brent
may
have
the
shelf
,
if
she
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
your
dean
for
his
kind
offer
of
lend
me
money
.
 
<EOS>
Will
that
be
enough
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
a
hundred
people
would
lend
me
money
,
or
to
any
man
who
have
not
the
reputation
of
a
squanderer
.
<EOS>
o
,
faith
,
I
should
be
glad
to
be
in
the
same
kingdom
with
MD
,
however
,
although
you
be
at
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
keep
here
by
a
most
capricious
fate
,
which
I
would
break
through
,
if
I
could
do
it
with
decency
or
honour
.
 
<EOS>
to
return
without
some
mark
of
distinction
would
look
extremely
little
;
and
I
would
likewise
gladly
be
somewhat
rich
than
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more
,
but
beg
you
to
be
easy
till
Fortune
take
her
course
,
and
to
believe
that
MD
's
felicity
be
the
great
end
I
aim
at
in
all
my
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
let
us
talk
no
more
on
this
subject
,
which
make
me
melancholy
,
and
that
I
would
fain
divert
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
no
man
breathe
at
present
have
less
share
of
happiness
in
life
than
I
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
I
be
unhappy
at
all
,
but
that
everything
here
be
tasteless
to
me
for
want
of
be
as
I
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
a
short
sigh
,
and
no
more
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
come
and
let
's
see
what
be
next
,
young
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
Mrs.
Edgworth
and
Sterne
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
some
method
about
that
box
.
 
<EOS>
what
order
would
you
have
me
give
about
the
picture
?
 
<EOS>
can
not
you
do
with
it
as
if
it
be
your
own
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
hope
Manley
will
keep
his
place
;
for
I
hear
nothing
of
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
's
lose
his
.
 
<EOS>
send
nothing
under
cover
to
Mr.
Addison
,
but
"
to
Erasmus
Lewis
,
Esq
.
<EOS>
;
at
my
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
at
Whitehall
.
"
 
<EOS>
direct
your
outside
so
.
 
<EOS>
poor
dear
Stella
,
do
not
write
in
the
dark
,
nor
in
the
light
neither
,
but
dictate
to
Dingley
;
she
be
a
naughty
,
healthy
girl
,
and
may
drudge
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
good
company
together
?
<EOS>
and
do
not
you
quarrel
too
often
?
 
<EOS>
pray
love
one
another
,
and
kiss
one
another
just
now
,
as
Dingley
be
read
this
;
for
you
quarrel
this
morning
just
after
Mrs.
Marget
have
pour
water
on
Stella
's
head
:
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
little
bird
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
have
answer
everything
in
your
letter
that
require
it
,
and
yet
the
second
side
be
not
full
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
come
home
at
night
,
and
say
more
;
and
to
-
morrow
this
go
for
certain
.
 
<EOS>
go
,
get
you
go
to
your
own
chamber
,
and
let
Presto
rise
like
a
modest
gentleman
,
and
walk
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
begin
to
sweat
less
in
the
forehead
by
constant
walking
than
I
use
to
do
;
<EOS>
but
then
I
shall
be
so
sunburnt
,
the
lady
will
not
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
let
me
rise
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Ford
to
-
day
at
his
lodging
,
and
I
find
wine
out
of
my
own
cellar
<EOS>
,
some
of
my
own
chest
of
the
great
Duke
's
wine
:
 
it
begin
to
turn
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
wine
with
you
in
Ireland
be
half
a
crown
a
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
as
Stella
say
;
nothing
that
once
grow
dear
in
Ireland
ever
grow
cheap
again
,
except
corn
,
with
a
pox
,
to
ruin
the
parson
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
to
-
day
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
give
me
further
thank
about
vindicate
him
to
Mr.
Harley
and
Mr.
St.
John
,
and
tell
me
a
long
story
about
your
Mayor
's
election
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
find
he
have
have
a
finger
,
and
give
way
to
further
talk
about
him
;
but
we
know
nothing
of
it
here
yet
.
 
<EOS>
this
walk
to
and
fro
,
and
dress
myself
,
take
up
so
much
of
my
time
that
I
can
not
go
among
company
so
much
as
formerly
;
yet
what
must
a
body
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
thank
God
I
yet
continue
much
well
since
I
leave
the
town
;
I
know
not
how
long
it
may
last
.
 
<EOS>

:
 
<EOS>
he

Earl
of
Oxford

Earl
Mortimer
,
and
Lord
Harley
of
Wigmore
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
My
letter

or
I
would
have
tell
you
this
yesterday
;
but
the
public
news
may
tell
it
you
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
,
for
all
her
favour
,
have
keep
a
rod
for
him
in
her
closet
this
week
;
I
suppose
he
will
take
it
from
her
,
though
,
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
at
eight
o'clock
this
evening
it
rain
prodigiously
,
as
it
do
from
five
;
however
,
I
set
out
,
and
in
half
-
way
the
rain
lessen
,
and
I
get
home
,
but
tolerably
wet
;
and
this
be
the
first
wet
walk
I
have
have
in
a
month
's
time
that
I
be
here
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
I
get
to
bed
,
after
a
short
visit
to
Atterbury
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
It
rain
this
morning
,
and
I
go
to
town
by
water
;
and
Ford
and
I
dine
with
Mr.
Lewis
by
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
I
order
Patrick
to
bring
my
gown
and
periwig
to
Mr.
Lewis
,
because
I
design
to
go
to
see
Lord
Oxford
,
and
so
I
tell
the
dog
;
but
he
never
come
,
though
I
stay
an
hour
longer
than
I
appoint
;
so
I
go
in
my
old
gown
,
and
sit
with
him
two
hour
,
but
could
not
talk
over
some
business
I
have
with
him
;
so
he
have
desire
me
to
dine
with
him
on
Sunday
,
and
I
must
disappoint
the
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
set
me
down
at
a
coffee
-
house
,
where
I
wait
for
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
's
chariot
to
bring
me
to
Chelsea
;
for
it
have
rain
prodigiously
all
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dean
do
not
come
himself
,
but
send
me
his
chariot
,
which
have
cost
me
two
shilling
to
the
coachman
;
and
so
I
be
get
home
,
and
Lord
know
what
be
become
of
Patrick
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
send
him
over
to
you
;
for
he
be
an
intolerable
rascal
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
come
without
a
gown
,
he
would
have
serve
me
so
,
though
my
life
and
preferment
should
have
lain
upon
it
:
 
and
I
be
make
a
livery
for
him
will
cost
me
four
pound
;
but
I
will
order
the
tailor
to
-
morrow
to
stop
till
further
order
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Oxford
can
not
yet
abide
to
be
call
"
my
lord
"
;
and
when
I
call
him
"
my
lord
,
"
he
call
me
"
Dr.
Thomas
Swift
,
"
which
he
always
do
when
he
have
a
mind
to
tease
me
.
 
<EOS>
by
a
second
hand
,
he
propose
my
be
his
chaplain
,
which
I
by
a
second
hand
excuse
;
but
we
have
no
talk
of
it
to
-
day
:
 
but
I
will
be
no
man
's
chaplain
alive
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
and
be
busy
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
Patrick
till
this
morning
,
and
that
only
once
,
for
I
dress
myself
without
him
;
and
when
I
go
to
town
he
be
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
send
for
the
tailor
,
and
order
him
to
stop
his
hand
in
Patrick
's
clothe
till
further
order
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
if
it
be
in
Ireland
,
I
should
have
turn
him
off
ten
time
ago
;
and
it
be
no
regard
to
him
,
but
myself
,
that
have
make
me
keep
him
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
be
afraid
to
give
the
rogue
his
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
be
here
to
entreat
for
him
,
just
here
at
the
bed
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Ashburnham
have
be
engage
me
this
long
time
to
dine
with
her
,
and
I
set
to

apart
for
it
;
and
whatever
be
the
mistake
,
she
send
me
word
she
be
at
dinner
and
undressed
,
but
would
be
glad
to
see
me
in
the
afternoon
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
dine
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
,
and
would
not
go
to
see
her
at
all
,
in
a
huff
.
 
<EOS>
My
fine
Florence
be
turn
sour
with
a
vengeance
,
and
I
have
not
drunk
half
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
be
come
home
to
-
night
,
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
and
Tom
Harley
meet
me
in
the
Park
,
and
make
me
walk
with
them
till
nine
,
like
unreasonable
whelp
;
<EOS>
so
I
get
not
here
till
ten
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
fine
evening
,
and
the
foot
-
path
clean
enough
already
after
this
hard
rain
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
go
this
morning
to
town
,
I
see
two
old
lame
fellow
,
walk
to
a
brandy
-
shop
,
and
when
they
get
to
the
door
,
stand
a
long
time
complimenting
who
should
go
in
first
.
 
<EOS>
though
this
be
no
jest
to
tell
,
it
be
an
admirable
one
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
my
Lord
Oxford
and
the
lady
,
the
new
Countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
who
have
be
these

.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
leave
us
at
seven
,
and
I
have
no
time
to
speak
to
him
about
some
affair
;
but
he
promise
in
a
day
or
two
we
shall
dine
alone
;
which
be
mighty
likely
,
consider
we
expect
every
moment
that
the
Queen
will
give
him
the
staff
,
and
then
he
will
be
so
crowded
he
will
be
good
for
nothing
:
 
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
he
may
have
it
to
-
night
at
Council
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
petition
send
me
t'other
day
from
one
Stephen
Gernon
,
set
forth
that
he
formerly
live
with
Harry
Tenison
,
who
give
him
an
employment
of
gauger
,
and
that
he
be
turn
out
after
Harry
's
death
,
and
come
for
England
,
and
be
now
starve
,
or
,
as
he
express
it
,
<EOS>
that
the
STAFF
of
LIFE
have
be
of
late
a
stranger
to
his
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
today
the
poor
fellow
call
,
and
I
know
him
very
well
,
a
young
slender
fellow
with
freckle
in
his
face
:
you
must
remember
him
;
he
wait
at
table
as
a
well
sort
of
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
crown
,
and
promise
to
do
what
I
could
to
help
him
to
a
service
,
which
I
do
for
Harry
Tenison
's
memory
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bloody
hot
walk
to
-
day
,
and
I
be
so
lazy
<EOS>
I
dine
where
my
new
gown
be
,
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
and
come
back
like
a
fool
,
and
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
have
sit
with
me
till
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Oxford
have
not
the
staff
yet
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
in
town
by
ten
,
though
it
be
shaving
-
day
,
and
go
to
the
Secretary
about
some
affair
,
then
visit
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Ormond
;
but
the
latter
be
dress
to
go
out
,
and
I
could
not
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Oxford
have
the
staff
give
him
this
morning
;
so
now
I
must
call
him
Lord
Oxford
no
more
,
but
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
stick
there
:
 
<EOS>
this
be
twice
he
have
change
his
name
this
week
;
and
I
hear
to
-
day
in
the
City
(
where
I
dine
)
that
he
will
very
soon
have
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
do
not
you
observe
how
strangely
I
have
change
my
company
and
manner
of
living
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
go

Addison

Steele
,
Henley
,
Lady
Lucy

Mrs.
Finch
,
Lord
Somers
,
Lord
Halifax

etc

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
do

in
your

about
choose
a
Mayor
,
and
that
he
apprehend
some
censure
for
the
share
he
have
in
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
hear
anything
of
it
here
;
but
I
shall
not
be
always
able
to
defend
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear
your
Bishop
Hickman
be
dead
;
but
nobody
here
will
do
anything
for
me
in
Ireland
;
so
they
may
die
as
fast
or
slow
as
they
please
.
 
<EOS>
well

you
be
constant
to
your
dean

Parson

and

<EOS>
I

me
:
 
I
could
not
call

them
to

but

morrow
;
and
perhaps
one
of
them
may
be
from
our
little
MD
,
who
know
,
man
?
<EOS>
who
can
tell
?
<EOS>
many
a
more
unlikely
thing
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw

I

so
plaguy

I
can
hardly
see

.
 
<EOS>
WRITE

SIRRAH

<EOS>

<EOS>

Mr.

<EOS>
Come

I

<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
hot
and
lazy
after
my
morning
's
walk
,
that
I
loiter
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
where
my
good
gown
and
periwig
be
,
and
out
of
mere
listlessness
dine
there
very
often
;
so
I
do
to

day
;
but
I
get
little
MD
's
letter
,
N.15
<EOS>
(
you
see
,
sirrah
,
I
remember
to
tell
the
number
)
,
from
Mr.
Lewis
,
and
I
read
it
in
a
closet
they
lend
me
at
Mrs.
Van
's
;
and
I
find
Stella
be
a
saucy
rogue
and
a
great
writer
,
and
can
write
finely
still
when
her
hand
be
in
,
and
her
pen
good
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
here
to

night
,
I
have
a
mighty
mind
to
go
swim
after
I
be
cool
,
for
my
lodging
be
just
by
the
river
;
and
I
go
down
with
only
my
nightgown
and
slipper
on
at
eleven
,
but
come
up
again
;
however
,
one
of
these
night
I
will
venture
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
hot
this
morning
with
my
walk
,
that
I
resolve
to
do
so
no
more
during
this
violent
burning
weather
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
comical
that
now
we
happen
to
have
such
heat
to
ripen
the
fruit
there
have
be
the
great
blast
that
be
ever
know
,
and
almost
all
the
fruit
be
despair
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Shelburne
:
<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
be
go
to
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
this
evening
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
sit
about
two
hour
with
him
in
mixed
company
;
he
leave
us
,
and
go
to
Court
,
and
carry
two
stave
with
him
,
so
I
suppose
we
shall
have
a
new
Lord
Steward
or
Comptroller
to
-
morrow
;
I
smoke
that
state
secret
out
by
that
accident
.
 
<EOS>
I

and
so
hot
by
the
time
I
get
to
Ford
's
lodging
<EOS>
that
I
be
quite
spend
<EOS>
;
I
think
the
weather
be
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
the
Secretary
as
usual
,
and
old
Colonel
Graham
that
live
at
Bagshot
Heath
,
and
they
say
it
be
Colonel
Graham
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
I
remember
it
very
well
,
when
I
use
to
go
for
a
walk
to
London
from
Moor
Park
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
I
warrant
you
do
not

.
 
<EOS>
when
must

<EOS>
Heat
and
laziness
,
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine

me
dine
to

at
Mrs.
Van

and
,
in
short

hour
this

<EOS>
They

very
good

and
if
Lady
Betty

Ireland
,
you
should
let
her
be
acquaint
with
you

<EOS>
how

<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
to
-
day
,
and
go
from
hence
early
to
town
,
and
visit
the
Duke
of
Ormond
and
Mr.
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
my
Lord
Treasurer
have
a
dead
warrant
in
his
pocket
;
they
mean
a
list
of
those
who
be
to
be
turn
out
of
employment
;
and
we
every
day
now
expect
those
change
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
by
the
Treasury
to
-
day
,
and
see
vast
crowd
wait
to
give
Lord
Treasurer
petition
as
he
pass
by
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
now
at
the
top
of
power
and
favour
:
 
<EOS>
he
keep
no
levee
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
cruel
thirsty
this
hot
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
just
this
minute
go
to
swim
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
Patrick
down
with
me
,
to
hold
my
nightgown
,
shirt
,
and
slipper
,
and
borrow
a
napkin
of
my
landlady
for
a
cap
.
 
<EOS>
so
farewell
till
I
come
up
;
but
there
be
no
danger
,
do
not
be
fright
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
swim
this
half
-
hour
and
more
;
and
when
I
be
come
out
I
dive
,
to
make
my
head
and
all
through
wet
,
like
a
cold
bath
;
but
,
as
I
dive
,
the
napkin
fall
off
and
be
lose
,
and
I
have
that
to
pay
for
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
,
the
great
stone
be
so
sharp
<EOS>
,
I
could
hardly
set
my
foot
on
them
as
I
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pure
and
warm
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
to
bed
,
and
will
now
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
this
letter
shall
go
to
-
morrow
;
so
I
will
answer
yours
when
I
come
home
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
no
hurt
from
last
night
's
swimming
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
with
nothing
but
the
sheet
over
me
,
and
my
foot
quite
bare
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
go
to
town
before
the
tide
be
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrah
;
dear
sirrah
,
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
feel
so
hot
a
day
as
this
since
I
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lady
Betty
Germaine
,
and
there
be
the
young
Earl
of
Berkeley
and
his
fine
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
her
before
,
nor
think
her
near
so
handsome
as
she
pass
for
.
 
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
Mr.
Bertue
would
not
let
me
put
ice
in
my
wine
,
but
say
my
Lord
Dorchester
get
the
bloody
flux
with
it
,
and
that
it
be
the
bad
thing
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
we
plague
,
thus
be
we
plagued
;
yet
I
have
do
it
five
or
six
time
this
summer
,
and
be
but
the
drier
and
the
hotter
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
make
me
so
excessively
peevish
as
hot
weather
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Berkeley
after
dinner
clap
my
hat
on
another
lady
's
head
,
and
she
in
roguery
put
it
upon
the
rail
.
 
<EOS>
I
mind
them
not
;
but
in
two
minute
they
call
me
to
the
window
,
and
Lady
Carteret
show
me
my
hat
out
of
her
window
five
door
off
,
where
I
be
force
to
walk
to
it
,
and
pay
her
and
old
Lady
Weymouth
a
visit
,
with
some
more
beldame
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
go
and
drink
coffee
,
and
make
one
or
two
pun
,
with
Lord
Pembroke
,
and
design
to
go
to
Lord
Treasurer
;
but
it
be
too
late
,
and
beside
I
be
half
broil
,
and
broil
without
butter
;
for
I
never
sweat
after
dinner
,
if
I
drink
any
wine
.
<EOS>
then
I
sit
an
hour
with
Lady
Betty
Butler
at
tea
,
and
everything
make
me
hot
and
drier
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
walk
home
,
and
be
here
by
ten
,
so
miserably
hot
,
that
I
be
in
as
perfect
a
passion
as
ever
<EOS>
I
be
in
my
life
at
the
great
affront
or
provocation
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
sit
an
hour
,
till
I
be
quite
dry
and
cool
enough
to
go
swim
;
which
I
do
,
but
with
so
much
vexation
that
I
think
I
have
give
it
over
:
 
for
I
be
every
moment
disturb
by
boat
,
rot
them
;
and
that
puppy
Patrick
,
stand
ashore
,
would
let
them
come
within
a
yard
or
two
,
and
then
call
sneakingly
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
comfort
I
propose
here
in
hot
weather
be
go
;
for
there
be
no
jesting
with
those
boat
after
it
be
dark
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
none
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dive
to
dip
my
head
,
and
hold
my
cap
on
with
both
my
hand
,
for
fear
of
lose
it
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
the
boat
!
 
<EOS>
amen
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
near
twelve
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
will
answer
your
letter
<EOS>
(
it
strike
twelve
now
)
to
-
morrow
morning
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
now
let
us
answer
MD
's
letter
,
N.15
,
15
,
15
,
15
.
 
<EOS>
now
have
I
tell
you
the
number
?
 
<EOS>
15
,
15
;
there
,
impudence
,
to
call
name
in
the
beginning
of
your
letter
,
before
you
say
,
how
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Presto
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
your
breeding
!
 
<EOS>
where
be
your
manner
,
sirrah
,
to
a
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
get
<EOS>
you
go
,
you
couple
of
jade
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
never
sit
up
late
now
;
but
this
abominable
hot
weather
will
force
me
to
eat
or
drink
something
that
will
do
me
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
venture
to
eat
a
few
strawberry
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
do
you
know
in
Ireland
that
Mr.
St.
John
talk
so
in
Parliament
?
 
<EOS>
Your
whig
be
plaguily
bit
;
for
he
be
entirely
for
their
be
all
out
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
you
as
vicious
in
snuff
as
ever
?
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
as
you
say
,
it
do
neither
hurt
nor
good
;
but
I
have
leave
it
off
,
and
when
anybody
offer
me
their
box
,
I
take
about
a
tenth
part
of
what
I
use
to
do
,
and
then
just
smell
to
it
,
and
privately
fle
the
rest
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
to
my
tobacco
still
,
as
you
say
;
but
even
much
less
of
that
than
formerly
,
only
morning
and
evening
,
and
very
seldom
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Joe
,
I
have
recommend
his
case
heartily
to
my
Lord
Lieutenant
;
and
,
by
his
direction
,
give
a
memorial
of
it
to
Mr.
Southwell
,
to
whom
I
have
recommend
it
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
no
more
,
if
he
be
my
brother
.
 
<EOS>
His
business
will
be
to
apply
himself
to
Southwell
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
must
desire
Raymond
,
if
Price
of
Galway
come
to
town
,
to
desire
him
to
wait
on
Mr.
Southwell
,
as
recommend
by
me
for
one
of
the
Duke
's
chaplain
,
which
be
all
I
could
do
for
him
;
and
he
must
be
present
to
the
Duke
,
and
make
his
court
,
and
ply
about
,
and
find
out
some
vacancy
,
and
solicit
early
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
bustle
about
your
Mayor
<EOS>
I
have
before
,
as
I
tell
you
,
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
be
Raymond
not
come
till
May
18
?
 
<EOS>
so
he
say
fine
thing
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
certainly
he
lie
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
use
him
indifferently
enough
;
and
we
never
once
dine
together
,
or
walk
,
or
be
in
any
third
place
;
only
he
come
sometimes
to
my
lodging
,
and
even
there
be
oftener
deny
than
admit
.
 
<EOS>
what
an
odd
bill
be
that
you
send
of
Raymond
's
!
 
<EOS>
a
bill
upon
one
Murry
in
Chester
,
which
depend
entirely
not
only
upon
Raymond
's
honesty
,
but
his
discretion
;
and
in
money
matter
he
be
the
last
man
I
would
depend
on
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
Sir
Alexander
Cairnes
in
London
pay
me
a
bill
,
draw
by
God
<EOS>
know
who
,
upon
Murry
in
Chester
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
at
Cairnes
's
,
and
they
can
do
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
among
some
friend
,
who
be
merchant
,
and
I
find
the
bill
must
be
send
to
Murry
,
accept
by
him
,
and
then
return
back
,
and
then
cairne
may
accept
or
refuse
it
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
accordingly
I
give
Sir
Thomas
Frankland
the
bill
,
who
have
send
it
to
Chester
,
and
order
the
postmaster
there
to
get
it
accept
,
and
then
send
it
back
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
I
shall
have
an
answer
;
and
therefore
this
letter
must
stay
a
day
or
two
long
than
I
intend
,
and
see
what
answer
I
get
.
 
<EOS>
Raymond
should
have
write
to
Murry
at
the
same
time
,
to
desire
Sir
Alexander
Cairnes
to
have
answer
such
a
bill
,
if
it
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
Cairnes
's
clerk
(
himself
be
not
at
home
)
say
they
have
receive
no
notice
of
it
,
and
could
do
nothing
;
and
advise
me
to
send
to
Murry
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
six
week
to
-
day
at
Chelsea
,
and
you
know
it
<EOS>
but
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
Dean
  
think
I
write
the
Medley
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
of
his
judgment
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
equal
to
his
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
then
you
han't
see
the
Miscellany
yet
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
'
tis
a
four
-
shill
book
:
 
<EOS>
have
nobody
carry
it
over
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
believe
Manley
will
not
lose
his
place
;
for
his
friend
in
England
be
so
far
from
be
out
that
he
have
take
a
new
patent
since
the
Post
Office
Act
;
and
his
brother
Jack
Manley
here
take
his
part
firmly
;
and
I
have
often
speak
to
Southwell
in
his
behalf
,
and
he
seem
very
well
inclined
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
irish
folk
here
in
general
be
horribly
violent
against
him
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
must
consider
he
could
not
send
Stella
wine
if
he
be
put
out
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
be
very
kind
,
and
send
you
a
dozen
bottle
of
wine
at
<EOS>
a
time
,
<EOS>
and
you
win
eight
shilling
<EOS>
AT
a
time
;
and
how
much
do
you
lose
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
never
one
syllable
about
that
,
I
warrant
you
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
this
same
Stella
be
so
unmerciful
a
writer
,
she
have
hardly
leave
any
room
for
Dingley
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
such
summer
there
as
here
,
sure
the
Wexford
water
be
good
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
what
weather
we
have
May
6th
;
go
look
in
my
journal
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
terrible
rain
the
24th
and
25th
,
and
never
a
drop
since
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
remember
Berested
's
bridge
;
the
coach
sosse
up
and
down
as
one
go
that
way
,
just
as
at
hockley
-
in
-
the
-
Hole
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
impute
any
illness
or
health
<EOS>
I
have
to
good
or
ill
weather
,
but
to
want
of
exercise
,
or
ill
air
,
or
something
I
have
eat
,
or
hard
study
,
or
sit
up
;
and
so
I
fence
against
those
as
well
as
I
can
:
 
but
who
a
deuce
can
help
the
weather
?
 
<EOS>
Will
Seymour
,
the
General
,
be
excessively
hot
with
the
sun
shine
full
upon
him
;
so
he
turn
to
the
sun
,
and
say
,
"
Harkee
,
friend
,
you
have
better
go
and
ripen
cucumber
than
plague
me
at
this
rate
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
another
time
,
fret
at
the
heat
,
a
gentleman
by
say
it
be
such
weather
as
please
God
:
 
<EOS>
Seymour
say
,
"
perhaps
it
may
;
but
I
be
sure
it
please
nobody
else
.
"
 
<EOS>
why
,
Madam
Dingley
,
the
first
-
fruit
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
Southwell
tell
me
they
go
to
inquire
about
them
,

the

's
house
at
the
town
's
end
,
and
an
estate
there
in
a
delicious
country
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Kerry
and
Mrs.
Pratt
be
with
us
,
and
we
pass
our
time
well
enough
;
and
there
I
wholly
disengage
myself
from
all
public
thought
,
and
everything
but
MD
,
who
have
the
impudence
to
send
me
a
letter
there
;
but
I
will
be
revenge
:
 
I

.
 
<EOS>
this

the

,
I

and

<EOS>
I

his

,
and
there
be
Lord

:
 
<EOS>
so
I

,
and
we

<EOS>
and
the
Secretary
and
I
dine
at
Sir

who
marry
Lady
Catharine
Seymour
,
your
acquaintance
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
ten
of
us
at

.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
,
in
my
absence
,
they
have
erect
a
Club
,
and
make
me
one
;
and
we
make
some
law
to
-
day
,
which
I
be
to
digest
and
add
to
,
against
next
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Our
meeting
be
to
be
every
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
yet
but
twelve
:
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
and
Lord
Treasurer
be
propose
;
but
I
be
against
them
,
and
so
be
Mr.
Secretary
,
though
their
son
be
of
it
,
and
so
they
be
exclude
;
but
we
design
to
admit
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
.
 
<EOS>
the
end
of
our
Club
be
,
to
advance
conversation
and
friendship
,
and
to
reward
deserve
person
with
our
interest
and
recommendation
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
in
none
but
man
of
wit
or
man
of
interest
;
and
if
we
go
on
as
we
begin
,
no
other
Club
in
this
town
will
be
worth
talk
of
.
 
<EOS>
the
Solicitor
-
General
,
Sir
Robert
Raymond
,
be
one
of
our
Club
;
and
I
order
him
immediately
to
write
to
your
Lord
Chancellor
in
favour
of
Dr.
Raymond
:
 
<EOS>
so
tell
Raymond
,
if
you
see
him
;
but
I
believe
this
will
find
you
at
Wexford
.
 
<EOS>
this
letter
will
come
three
week
after
the
last
,
so
there
be
a
week
lose
;
but
that
be
owe
to
my
be
out
of
town
;
yet
I
think
it
be
right
,
because
it
go
enclose
to
Mr.
Reading
:
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
he
know
how
often
Presto
write
to
MD
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
I
sit
this

with
Lady
Betty
Butler
and
Lady
Ashburnham
,
and
then
come
home
by
eleven
,
and
have
a
good
cool
walk
;
for
we
have
have
no
extreme
hot
weather
this
fortnight
,
but
a
great
deal
of
rain
at
time
,
and
a
body
can
live
and
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
hold
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
peach

.
 
<EOS>
I

Lewis
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
Will
Congreve
attend
at
the
Treasury
,
by
order
,
with
his
brother
,
the
Commissioners
of
the
Wine
Licences
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
mention
him
with
kindness
to
Lord

;
and
Congreve
tell
me
that
,
after
they
have
answer
to
what
they
be
send
for
,
my
lord
call
him
privately
,
and
speak
to
him
with
great
kindness
,
promise
his
protection
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
man
say
he
have
be
use
so
ill
of
late
year
that
he
be
quite
astonished
at
my

,
etc

,
and
desire
me
to
tell
my

so
;
which
I
do
this
evening
,
and
recommend
him
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
assure
me
he
esteem
him
very
much
,
and
would
be
always
kind
to
him
;
<EOS>
that
what
he
say
be
to
make
Congreve
easy
,
because
he
know
people
talk
as
if
his
lordship
design
to
turn
everybody
out
,
and
particularly
Congreve
:
 
which
indeed
be
true
,
for
the
poor
man
tell
me
he
apprehend
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
leave

on
Congreve
(
know
where
he
dine
)
,
and
tell
him
what
have
pass
between
my
lord
and
me
;
so
I
have
make
a
worthy
man
easy
,
and
that
be
a
good
day
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
propose
to
my
lord
to
erect
a
society
or
academy
for
correct
and
settle
our
language
,
that
we
may
not
perpetually
be
change
as
we
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
enter
mightily
into
it
,
so
do
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
;
and
I
design
to
write
a
letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
with
the
proposal
of
it
,
and
publish
it
;
and
so
I
tell
my

,
and
he
approve
it
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

at
Lord

with
his

for

not

:
 
<EOS>
she

a
very
good

<EOS>
Sterne
tell
me
he
have
desire
a
friend
to
receive
your
box
in
Chester
,
and
carry
it
over

<EOS>
I
fear
he
will
miscarry
in
his
business
,
which
be
send
to
the
Treasury
before
he
be
recommend
;
for
I
be
positive
only
to
second
his
recommendation
,
and
all
his
other
friend
fail
him
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
on

I

I
can
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
We
have
much
company
to

.
 
<EOS>
prior
never
fail
:
 
<EOS>
he

well
courti
than

and
we
expect
every

that
he
will
be
a
Commissioner
of
the
Customs
,
and
that
in
a
short
time
a
great
many
more
will
be
turn
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
blame
Lord
Treasurer
for
his
slowness
in
turn
people
out
;
but
I
suppose
he
have
his
reason
.
 
<EOS>
They
still
keep
my
neighbour
Atterbury
in
suspense
about
the
deanery
of
Christ
Church
,
which
have
be
above
six
month
vacant
,
and

heartily
angry
.

scold
.

<EOS>
do
not
fall

hurt
yourself

<EOS>
love

another

<EOS>
he

four
,
and
bring
prior
with
him
,
and
have
forget
the
appointment
,
and
no

.
 
<EOS>
I
leave

and
go

change
my

and

and
Dingley

<EOS>
I

like
a

.
 
<EOS>
Lady

like

so
I

<EOS>
It

<EOS>

<EOS>
Saturday

<EOS>
o
,
faith
<EOS>
,
Presto

be
a
sort
of
a
lazy
fellow
:
 
but
Presto
will
remove
to
town
this
day
<EOS>
se'ennight
;
the
Secretary
have
command
me
to
do
so
;
and
I
believe
he
and
I
shall
go
for
some
day
to
Windsor
,
where
he
will
have
leisure
to
mind
some
business
we

.
 
<EOS>
To

a
Club
)

Mr.
Secretary
's
:
 
<EOS>

the

town
.
<EOS>
We
sit
till

and
make
some
law
and
settlement
;
and
then
I
go
to
take
leave
of
Lady
Ashburnham
,
who
go
out
of
town
to
-
morrow
,
as
a
great
many
of
my
acquaintance
be
already
,
and
leave
the
town
very
thin
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
make
but
<EOS>
short
journey
this
summer
,
and
not
be
long
out
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
grow
sensibly
short
already
,
all
our
fruit
blast
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Duke
of
Ormond
be
still
at
Chester
;
and
perhaps
this
letter
will
be
with
you
as
soon
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
's
business
be
quite
blow
up
:
 
<EOS>
they
stand
to
it
to
send
him
back
to
the
Commissioners
of
the
Revenue
in
Ireland
for
a
reference
,
and
all
my
credit
could
not
alter
it
,
though
I
almost
fall
out
with
the
secretary
of
the
Treasury
,
who
be
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
cousin
-
germain
,
and
<EOS>
my
very
good
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
every
step
he
have
hitherto
take
hath
be
wrong
;
at
least
they
say
so
,
and
that
be
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
sorry
for
it
;
and
I
really
think
they
be
in
the
wrong
,
and
use
him
hardly
;
but
I
can
do
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
Steele
have
have
the
assurance
to
write
to
me
that
I
would
engage
my
Lord
Treasurer
to
keep
a
friend
of
his
in
an
employment
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
tell
you
how
he
and
Addison
serve
me
for
my
good
office
in
Steele
's
behalf
;
and
I
promise
Lord
Treasurer
never
to
speak
for
either
of
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dine
to

day
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
Ashe
have
be

:
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
twice
;
he
be
four
day
at
Lord
Pembroke
's
in
the
country
,
pun
with
him
;
his
face
be
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
evening
two
or
three
hour
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
who
call
me
Dr.
Thomas
Swift
twenty
time
;
that
be
his
way
of
teasing
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
him
at
nine
,
and
get
home
here
by
ten
,
like
a
gentleman
;
and
to
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
I
will
answer
your
little
letter
,
sirrah
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
terribly
sleepy
always
in
a
morning
;
I
believe
it
be
my
walk
over
-
night
that
dispose
me
to
sleep
:
 
faith
,
'
tis
now
strike
eight
,
and
I
be
but
just
awake
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
come
early
,
and
wake
me
five
or
six
time
;
but
I
have
excuse
,
though
I
be
three
part
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
sit
up
late
,
or
sleep
ill
in
the
night
,
and
often
it
be
a
lie
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
get
little
MD
's
letter
before
me
,
n.16
,
no
more
,
nor
no
less
<EOS>
,
no
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Dingley
say
,
"
this
letter
will
not
be
above
six
line
"
;
and
I
be
afraid
it
be
true
,
though
I
see
it
fill
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
writ
<EOS>
me
word
you
be
in
the
country
,
and
that
he
hear
you
be
well
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
at
heart
MD
ride
,
and
ride
,
and
ride
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hot
weather
end
in
May
,
and
all
this
month
have
be
moderate
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
then
so
hot
<EOS>
I
be
not
able
to
endure
it
;
I
be
miserable
every
moment
,
and
find
myself
disposed
to
be
peevish
and
quarrelsome
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
a
very
hot
country
would
make
me
stark
mad
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
head
continue
pretty
tolerable
,
and
I
impute
it
all
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
do
Stella
eat
fruit
?
 
<EOS>
I
eat
a
little
;
but
I
always
repent
,
and
resolve
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
in
very
hot
weather
I
always
go
to
town
by
water
;
but
I
constantly
walk
back
,
for
then
the
sun
be
down
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
Mrs.
Proby
go
with
you
to
Wexford
:
 
<EOS>
she
be
admirable
company
;
you
will
grow
plaguy
wise
with
those
you
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Taylor
and
Mrs.
Proby
!
<EOS>
take
care
of
infection
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
my
two
hundred
pound
will
be
pay
,
but
that
Sir
Alexander
Cairnes
be
a
scrupulous
puppy
:
 
<EOS>
I
leave
the
bill
with
Mr.
Stratford
,
who
be
to
have
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Madam
Stella
,
what
say
you
?
<EOS>
you
ride
every
day
;
I
know
that
already
,
sirrah
;
and
,
if
you
rid
every
day
for
a
twelvemonth
,
you
would
be
still
well
and
well
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
hope
Parvisol
will
not
have
the
impudence
to
make
you
stay
an
hour
for
the
money
;
if
he
do
,
I
will
UN
-
PARVISOL
him
;
pray
let
me
know
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord
,
how
hasty
we
be
!
<EOS>
Stella
can
not
stay
write
and
write
;
she
must
write
and
go
a
cock
-
horse
,
pray
now
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
the
horse
be
not
come
to
the
door
;
the
fellow
can
not
find
the
bridle
;
your
stirrup
be
break
;
where
do
you
put
the
whip
,
Dingley
?
<EOS>
Marget
,
where
have
you
lay
Mrs.
Johnson
's
ribbon
to
tie
about
her
?
<EOS>
reach
me
my
mask
:
 
<EOS>
sup
up
this
before
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
so
,
a
gallop
,
a
gallop
:
 
sit
fast
,
sirrah
,
and
do
not
ride
hard
upon
the
stone
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
now
Stella
be
go
,
tell
me
,
Dingley
,
be
she
a
good
girl
?
<EOS>
and
what
news
be
that
you
be
to
tell
me
?
  
<EOS>
no
,
I
believe
the
box
be
not
lose
:
 
<EOS>
Sterne
say
it
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
faith
,
you
must
go
to
Wexford
without
see
your
Duke
of
Ormond
,
unless
you
stay
on
purpose
;
perhaps
you
may
be
so
wise
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
be
your
sixteenth
letter
;
will
you
never
be
satisfied
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
I
will
walk
late
no
more
;
I
ought
less
to
venture
it
than
other
people
,
and
so
I
be
tell
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
return
to
lodge
in
town
next
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
when
you
come
from
Wexford
,
I
would
have
you
send
a
letter
of
attorney
to
Mr.
Benjamin
Tooke
,
bookseller
,
in
London
,
direct
to
me
;
and
he
shall
manage
your
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
your
parchment
safely
lock
up
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
Madam
Stella
,
welcome
home
;
be
it
pleasant
riding
?
<EOS>
do
your
horse
stumble
?
<EOS>
how
often
do
the
man
light
to
settle
your
stirrup
?
<EOS>
ride
nine
mile
!
<EOS>
faith
,
you
have
gallop
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
where
be
the
fine
thing
you
promise
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
good
boy
,
ask
Dingley
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
do
not
meet
the
fine
-
thing
-
man
:
 
<EOS>
faith
,
you
be
a
cheat
.
<EOS>
so
you
will
see
Raymond
and
his
wife
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
that
ride
to
Laracor
give
me
short
sigh
,
as
well
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
day
I
have
pass
here
have
be
dirt
to
those
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
gain
enemy
by
the
score
,
and
friend
by
the
couple
;
which
be
against
the
rule
of
wisdom
,
because
they
say
one
enemy
can
do
more
hurt
than
ten
friend
can
do
good
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
have
my
revenge
at
least
,
if
I
get
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
let
fate
govern
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
think
your
letter
be
answer
;
and
mine
will
be
short
than
ordinary
,
because
it
must
go
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
a
great
deal
of
scatter
rain
for
some
day
past
,
yet
it
hardly
keep
down
the
dust
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
play
act
in
our
town
;
and
Patrick
be
at
one
of
them
,
<EOS>
oh
oh
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
damnably
maul
one
day
when
he
be
drunk
;
he
be
at
cuff
with
a
brother
-
footman
,
who
drag
him
along
the
floor
upon
his
face
,
which
look
for
a
week
after
as
if
he
have
the
leprosy
;
and
I
be
glad
enough
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
ten
time
send
him
over
to
you
;
yet
now
he
have
new
clothe
,
and
a
laced
hat
,
which
the
hatter
bring
by
his
order
,
and
he
offer
to
pay
for
the
lace
out
of
his
wage
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
dine
to
-
day
with
dilly
at
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
,
who
have
buy
a
new
house
,
and
will
be
weary
of
it
in
half
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rise
and
shave
,
and
walk
to
town
,
unless
I
go
with
the
Dean
in
his
chariot
at
twelve
,
which
be
too
late
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
not
see
that
Lord
Peterborow
yet
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
be
almost
well
again
,
and
will
be
abroad
in
a
day
or
two
:
 
<EOS>
what
care
you
?
 
<EOS>
there
it
be
now
:
 
you
do
not
care
for
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
my
dear
life
and
delight
<EOS>
;
I
love
you
better
than
ever
,
if
possible
,
as
hope
save
,
I
do
,
and
ever
will
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
you
ever
,
and
make
us
happy
together
!
 
<EOS>
I
pray
for
this
twice
every
day
;
and
I
hope
God
will
hear
my
poor
hearty
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
remember
,
if
I
be
use
ill
and
ungratefully
,
as
I
have
formerly
be
,
'
tis
what
I
be
prepare
for
,
and
shall
not
wonder
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
be
now
envy
,
and
think
in
high
favour
,
and
have
every
day
number
of
considerable
man
tease
me
to
solicit
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
Ministry
all
use
me
perfectly
well
;
and
<EOS>
all
that
know
them
say
they
love
me
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
can
count
upon
nothing
,
nor
will
,
but
upon
MD
's
love
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
me
useful
;
they
pretend
they
be
afraid
of
none
but
me
,
and
that
they
resolve
to
have
me
;
they
have
often
confess
this
:
yet
all
make
little
impression
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
of
these
speculation
!
<EOS>
they
give
me
the
spleen
;
and
that
be
a
disease
I
be
not
bear
to
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
alone
,
sirrah
,
and
be
satisfied
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
as
long
as
MD
and
Presto
be
well
.
       
<EOS>
little
wealth
,
     
and
much
health
,
     
and
a
life
by
stealth
:
  
<EOS>
that
be
all
we
want
;
and
so
farewell
,
dear
MD
;
Stella
,
Dingley
,
Presto
,
all
together
,
now
<EOS>
and
for
ever
all
together
.

Farewell

and

<EOS>
He

and
make
him

;
the

almost
undo
him

<EOS>
I
dine
in

<EOS>
Lord

desire
to
see
me
this

at

;
I

since

home
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
Mrs.
Manley
there
,
who
be
solicit
him
to
get
some
pension
or
reward
for
her
service
in
the
cause
,
by
write
her
atalantis
,
and
prosecution
,
etc
.
,
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
second
her
,
and
hope
they
will
do
something
for
the
poor
woman
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
keep
me
two
hour
upon
politic
:
 
he
come
home
very
sanguine
;
he
have
certainly
do
great
thing
at
Savoy
and
Vienna
,
by
his
negotiation
:
 
he
be
violent
against
a
peace
,
and
find
true
what
I
writ
to
him
,
that
the
Ministry
seem
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
reason
well
;
yet
I
be
for
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
leave
of
Lady
Kerry
,
who
go
to
-
morrow
for
Ireland
;
she
pick
up
Lord
Shelburne
and
Mrs.
Pratt
at
Lord
Shelburne
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
evening
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
Tom
Harley
be
there
,
and
whisper
me
that
he
begin
to
doubt
about
Sterne
's
business
;
I
tell
him
he
would
find
he
be
in
the
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
two
or
three
hour
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
;
he
rally
me
sufficiently
upon
my
refusing
to
take
him
into
our
Club
,
and
tell
a
judge
who
be
with
us
that
my
name
be
Thomas
Swift
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
mind
to
prevent
Sir
H.
Belasyse
go
to
Spain
,
who
be
a
most
covetous
cur
,
and
I
fall
a
railing
against
avarice
,
and
turn
it
so
that
he
smoke
me
,
and
name
Belasyse
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
on
,
and
say
it
be
a
shame
to
send
him
;
to
which
he
agree
,
but
desire
I
would
name
some
who
understand
business
,
and
do
not
love
money
,
for
he
could
not
find
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
there
be
something
in
a
Treasurer
different
from
other
man
;
that
we
ought
not
to
make
a
man
a
Bishop
who
do
not
love
divinity
,
or
a
General
who
do
not
love
war
;
and
I
wonder
why
the
Queen
would
make
a
man
Lord
Treasurer
who
do
not
love
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
mightily
pleased
with
what
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
talk
of
the
first
-
Fruits
of
England
,
and
I
take
occasion
to
tell
him
that
I
would
not
for
a
thousand
pound
anybody
<EOS>
but
he
have
get
them
for
Ireland
,
who
get
them
for
England
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
bid
me
consider
what
a
thousand
pound
be
;
I
say
I
would
have
him
to
know
<EOS>
I
value
a
thousand
pound
as
little
as
he
value
a
million
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
silly
to
write
all
this
?
<EOS>
but
it
give
you
an
idea
what
our
conversation
be
with
mixed
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
take
a
lodging
in
Suffolk
Street
,
and
go
to
it
on
Thursday
;
and
design
to
walk
the
Park
and
the
town
,
to
supply
my
walking
here
:
 
yet
I
will
walk
here
sometimes
too
,
in
a
visit
now
and
then
to
the
Dean
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
almost
at
home
,
Patrick
tell
me
he
have
two
letter
for
me
,
and
give
them
to
me
in
the
dark
,
yet
I
could
see
one
of
them
be
from
saucy
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
visit
the
Dean
for
half
an
hour
;
and
then
come
home
,
and
first
read
the
other
letter
,
which
be
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
who
tell
me
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
mention
in
a
full
assembly
of
the
clergy
<EOS>
the
Queen
's
grant
the
First
-
Fruits
,
say
it
be
do
by
the
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
talk
much
of
my
merit
in
it
:
 
but
read
yours
<EOS>
I
find
nothing
of
that
:
 
<EOS>
perhaps
the
Bishop
lie
,
out
of
a
desire
to
please
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
sirrah
,
you
be
go
to
Wexford
;
but
I
will
follow
you
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
come
to
me
again
this
morning
,
to
advise
about
reason
and
memorial
he
be
draw
up
;
and
we
go
to
town
by
water
together
;
and
have
nothing
to
do
,
I
steal
into
the
City
to
an
instrument
of
mine
,
and
then
go
to
see
poor
Patty
Rolt
,
who
have
be
in

these
two
month
with
a
cousin
of
her

<EOS>
Her

some
country
town
as
cheap
as
she
can

and
,
when
she
run
out
,
shift
to
some
cheap
place
,
or
come
to
town
for
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
rich
,
I
would
ease
her
,
which
a
little
thing
would
do
.
<EOS>
some

I

guinea
,
and

,
and

.
 
<EOS>
I

to
live
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
have
a
fine
London
answer
:
 
<EOS>
but
first
I
will
go
sleep
,
and
dream
of
MD
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
July
5
.
 
<EOS>
this
day
I
leave
Chelsea
for
good
(
that
be
a
genteel
phrase
)
,
and
be
get
into
Suffolk
Street
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
at
our
Society
,
and
we
be
adjourn
for
a
month
,
because
most
of
us
go
into
the
country
:
 
<EOS>
we
dine
at
Lord
Keeper
's
with
young
Harcourt
,
and
Lord
Keeper
be
force
to
sneak
off
,
and
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
have
invite
the
Secretary
and
me
to
dine
with
him
;
but
we
scorn
to
leave
our
company
,
as
George
Granville
do
,
whom
we
have
threaten
to
expel
:
 
however
<EOS>
,
in
the
evening
I
go
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
,
among
other
company
,
find
a
couple
of
judge
with
him
;
one
of
them
,
Judge
Powell
,
an
old
fellow
with
grey
hair
,
be
the
merry
old
gentleman
I
ever
see
,
speak
pleasant
thing
,
and
laugh
and
chuckle
till
he
cry
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
till
eleven
,
because
I
be
not
now
to
walk
to
Chelsea
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
an
ugly
rainy
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
visit
Mrs.
Barton
,
then
call
at
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
where
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
the
rain
keep
me
to
dinner
;
and
there
do
<EOS>
I
loiter
all
the
afternoon
,
like
a
fool
,
out
of
perfect
laziness
,
and
the
weather
not
permit
me
to
walk
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
do
so
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
be
your
water
at
Wexford
good
in
this
rain
?
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
how
you
be
establish
there
,
how
and
whom
you
visit
,
what
be
your
lodging
,
what
be
your
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
get
far
southward
;
but
I
think
you
must
eat
no
fruit
while
you
drink
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
eat
some
kentish
cherry
t'other
day
,
and
I
repent
it
already
;
I
have
feel
my
head
a
little
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
a
hot
day
all
June
,
or
since
,
which
I
reckon
a
mighty
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
leave
a
direction
with
Reading
for
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
as
I
say
,
direct
this
to
Curry
's
,
and
the
next
to
reading
;
or
suppose
I
send
this
at
a
venture
straight
to
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
vex
me
to
have
it
miscarry
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
to
-
night
from
Parvisol
,
that
White
have
pay
me
most
of
my
remain
money
;
and
another

Joe
,
that
they
have
have
their
election
at
Trim

but
not
a
word
of

<EOS>
Poor
Joe
be
full
of
complaint
,
say
he
have
enemy
,
and
fear
he
will
never
get
his
two
hundred
pound
;
and
I
fear
so
too
,
although
I
have
do
what
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
your
letter
when
I
think
fit
,
when
saucy
Presto
think
fit
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
leisure
yet
;
when
I
have
nothing
to
do
,
perhaps
I
may
vouchsafe
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord

the
two
Wexford
lady
;
I
will
go
dream
of
you
both

the
dismall
rainy

:
 
<EOS>
I

the
Secretary
in
the
morning
,
and
he
be
go
to
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
begin
rain
,
and
I
strike
in
to
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh
's
,
and
dine
,
and
stay
till
night
very
dull
and
insipid
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
this
town
in
summer
;
I
will
leave
it
for
a
while
,
if
I
can
have
time
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I

a
fellow

<EOS>
lodge

the
same
house
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
tell
me
Squire
Tisdall
and
his
lady

here
.
 
<EOS>
I
pretend
<EOS>
I
never
hear
of
him
;
but
I
know
his
ugly
face
,
and
see
him
at
church
in
the
next
pew
to
me
,
and
he
often
look
for
a
bow
,
but
it
would
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
live
in
Capel
Street
,
and
have
an
ugly
fine
wife
in
a
fine
coach
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Freind

<EOS>
People

difficulty
about
pay
my
bill
;
so
that
I
can
not
give
order
yet
to
Parvisol
to
deliver
up
the
bond
to
Dr.
Raymond
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
I
shall
have
a
positive
answer
:
 
that
Cairnes
be
a
shuffling
scoundrel
;
and
several
merchant
have
tell
me
so
:
 
what
can
one
expect
from
a
Scot
and
a
fanatic
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
at
Bateman
's
the
bookseller
's
,
to
see
a
fine
old
library
he
have
buy
;
and
my
finger
itch
,
as
yours
would
do
at
a
china
-
shop
;
but
I
resist
,
and
find
everything
too
dear
,
and
I
have
fool
away
too
much
money
that
way
already
.
 
<EOS>
so
go
and
drink
your
water
,
saucy
rogue
,
and
make
yourself
well
;
and
pray
walk
while
you
be
there
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
notion
there
be
never
a
good
walk
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
find
all
place
without
tree
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
observe
the
inhabitant
about
Wexford
;
they
be
old
English
;
see
what
they
have
particular
in
their
manner
,
name
,
and
language
:
 
magpie
have
be
always
there
,
and
nowhere
else
in
Ireland
,
till
of
late
year
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
cock
and
dog
go
to
sleep
at
noon
,
and
so
do
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
write
your
travel
,
and
bring
home
good
eye
and
health
.

<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
we
do
not
sit
down
till
four
.
 
<EOS>
I
despatch
three
business
with
him
,
and
forget
a
fourth
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
get
a
friend
an
employment
;
and
besides
I
make
him
consent
to
let
me
bring
Congreve
to
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
understand
I
have
a
mind
to
do
a
small
thing
,
only
turn
out
all
the
Queen
's
physician
;
for
in
my
conscience
they
will
soon
kill
her
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
talk
over
that
matter
with
some
people
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Treasurer
tell
me
the
Queen
and
he
between
them
have
lose
the
paper
about
the
first
-
Fruits
,
but
desire
<EOS>
I
will
let
the
bishop
know
it
shall
be
do
with
the
first
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
dine
to

day
with
neighbour
Van
,
and
walk
pretty
well
in

.
 
<EOS>
Stella

hussy
,
do
not
you
remember
,
sirrah
,
you
use
to
reproach
me
about
meddle
in
other
folk
's
affair
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
enough
of
it
now
:
 
two
people
come
to
me
to
-
night
in
the
Park
to
engage
to
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
in
their
behalf
,
and
I
believe
they
make
up
fifty
who
have
ask
me
the
same
favour
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
harden
,
and
resolve
to
trouble
him
,
or
any
other
Minister
,
less
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
observe
those
who
have
ten
time
more
credit
than
I
will
not
speak
a
word
for
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
yesterday
the

ill
of
an
ague
ever
since
I
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
wretchedly
,
and
be
exceed
thankful
for
half
a
crown
I
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
crown
from
me
before
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to

in
the
City
,
who
be
to
get
me
out
a

<EOS>
I

of
Mr.

me
that
Cairnes
have
not
yet

my
two
hundred
pound

<EOS>
Young

indifferent
person
of
a

,
and
marry
her
for
love
after
long
courtship
,
and
she
refuse
him
until
he
get
his
last

<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
not
be

<EOS>
a

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

and
the

tell

t'other

he
have
refuse
a
very
good
one
for
me
,
but
it
be
in
a
place
he
do
not
like
;
and
I
know
nothing
of
get
anything
here
,
and
,
if
they
would
give
me
leave
,
I
would
come
over
just
now
.
<EOS>
Addison

<EOS>
oh

Dingley
;
that

<EOS>
yes

my
head

pretty
well
,
but
threaten
within
these
two
or
three
day
,
which
I
impute
to
some
fruit
I
eat
;
but
I
will
eat
no
more
:
 
not
a
bit
of
any
sort
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
a
journey
without
dust
,
and
that
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
for
a
Wexford
letter
,
but
must
not
think
of

yet
:
 
<EOS>
your

<EOS>
It

d####d
news
<EOS>
you

of
Mrs.

it
make
me
love
England
less
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
the
trunk
be
leave
or
take
;
<EOS>
so
'
tis
odd
enough
,
if
the
thing
in
it
be
mine
;
and
I
think
I
be
tell
that
there
be
some
thing
for
me
that
my
mother
leave
particularly
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
really
sorry
for
;
 
that
scoundrel
  
will
have
his
estate
after
his
mother
's
death
.
<EOS>
let
me
know
if
Mrs.
Walls
have
get
her
tea
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Richardson
stay
in
Dublin
till
it
come
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Walls
need
not
have
that
blemish
in
her
eye
;
for
I
be
not
in
love
with
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
do
not
like
anything
in
the
Examiner
after
the
45th
,
except
the
first
part
of
the
46th
;
all
the
rest
be
trash
;
and
if
you
like
them
,
especially
the
47th
,
your
judgment
be
spoil
by
ill
company
and
want
of
reading
,
<EOS>
which
I
be
more
sorry
for
than
you
think
:
 
and
I
have
spend
fourteen
year
in
improve
you
to
little
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Tooke
be
come
here
,
and
I
must
stop
.
)
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
,
and
he
keep
me
till
nine
;
so
I
can
not
send
this
to
-
night
,
as
I
intend
,
nor
write
some
other
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Green
,
his
surgeon
,
be
there
,
and
dress
his
breast
;
that
is
,
put
on
a
plaster
,
which
be
still
requisite
:
 
and
I
take
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
of
the
Queen
;
but
he
cut
me
short
with
this
saying
,
"
Laissez
faire
a
Don
Antoine
,
"
which
be
a
french
proverb
,
express
,
"
leave
that
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
be
against
her
take
much
physic
;
and
I
doubt
he
can
not
persuade
her
to
take
Dr.
Radcliffe
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
she
be
very
well
now
,
and
all
the
story
of
her
illness
,
except
the
first
day
or
two
,
be
a
lie
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
some
business
,
that
company
hinder
us
from
do
,
though
he
be
earnest
for
it
,
yet
would
not
appoint
me
a
certain
day
,
but
bid
me
come
at
all
time
till
we
can
have
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
this
take
up
a
great
deal
of
my
time
,
and
I
can
do
nothing
I
would
do
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
,
and
we
both
think
to
go
to
Windsor
for
some
day
,
to
despatch
an
affair
,
if
we
can
have
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
Sterne
meet
me
just

<EOS>

<EOS>
Your

should
speak
well
of
me
,
have
abuse
me
in
all
place
where
he
go

<EOS>
so
you

<EOS>
Poor

chicken

and
it
be
not

have
;
the

stark
naught

woman
's
;
and
it

such
a
favour
to

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
I

his
office
,
and
help
to
hinder
a
man
of

,
who
be
condemn
for
a
rape
.
 
<EOS>
the
Under
Secretary
be
willing
to
save
him
,
upon
an
old
notion
that
a
woman
can
not
be
ravish
;
but
I
tell
the
Secretary
he
could
not
pardon
him
without
a
favourable
report
from
the
judge
;
besides
,
he
be
a
fiddler
,
and
consequently
a
rogue
,
and
deserve
hang
for
some
thing
else
;
and
so
he
shall
swing
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
I
must
stand
up

honour
of
the
fair
sex
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
the
fellow
have
lain
with
her
a
hundred
time
before
,
but
what
care
I
for
that
!
 
<EOS>
what
,
must
a
woman
be
ravish
because
she
be
a
whore
?
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
go
on
Saturday
to
Windsor
for
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
stay
with
him
till
past
ten
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
day
at
his
levee
,
where
I
go
against
my
custom
,
because
I
have
a
mind
to
do
a
good
office
for
a
gentleman
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
talk
with
him
before
my
lord
,
that
he
may
see
me
,
and
then
find
occasion
to
recommend
him
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
excuse
my
coming
to
the
levee
,
that
I
do
it
to
see
the
sight
;
for
he
be
go
to
chide
me
away
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
there
but
once
,
and
that
be
long
before
he
be
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
be
all
full
,
and
as
many
Whigs
as
Tories
.
 
<EOS>
He
whisper
me
a
jest
or
two
,
and
bid
me
come
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
him
but
just
now
;
and
'
tis
late
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
have
at
last
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
him
and
Steele
to
-
day
at
young
Jacob
Tonson
's
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
Jacobs
think
it
be
I
who
have
make
the
Secretary
take
from
them
the
printing
of
the
Gazette
,
which
they
be
go
to
lose
,
and
Ben
Tooke
and
another
be
to
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
come
to
me
the
other
day
,
to
make
his
court
;
but
I
tell
him
it
be
too
late
,
and
that
it
be
not
my
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
they
will
lose
it
in
a
week
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
talk
as
usual
,
and
as
if
we
have
see
one
another
yesterday
;
and
Steele
and
I
be
very
easy
,
though
I
writ
him
lately
a
biting
letter
,
in
answer
to
one
of
his
,
where
he
desire
me
to
recommend
a
friend
of
his
to
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
go
,
get
you
go
to
your
water
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
do
they
give
you
a
stomach
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
eat
heartily
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
much
rain
to
-
day
and
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
in
the
City
,
and
see
poor
Patty
Rolt
,
and
give
her
a
pistole
to
help
her
a
little
forward
against
she
go
to
board
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
She
have
but
eighteen
pound
a
year
to
live
on
,
and
be
force
to
seek
out
for
cheap
place
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
raise
their
price
,
and
sometimes
they
starve
her
,
and
then
she
be
force
to
shift
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
the
puppy
put
too
much
ink
in
my
standish
,
and
,
carry
too
many
thing
together
<EOS>
,
I
spill
it
on
my
paper
and
floor
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
dull
,
wet
,
and
empty
;
Wexford
be
worth
two
of
it
;
I
hope
so
at
least
,
and
that
poor
little
MD
find
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
upon
go
to
Windsor
to
-
morrow
with
Mr.
Secretary
,
unless
he
change
his
mind
,
or
some
other
business
prevent
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
stay
there
a
week
,
I
hope
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
send
me
word
he
will
call
at
my
lodging
by
two
this
afternoon
,
to
take
me
to
Windsor
;
so
I
must
dine
nowhere
;
and
I
promise
Lord
Treasurer
to
dine
with
him
to
-
day
;
but
I
suppose
we
shall
dine
at
Windsor
at
five
,
for
we
make
but
three
hour
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
abroad
,
but
have
leave
Patrick
to
put
up
my
thing
,
and
to
be
sure
to
be
at
home
half
an
hour
before
two
.
 
<EOS>
Windsor
,
at
night

<EOS>
We
do
not
leave
London
till

and
dine

;
at

I
leave
the

,
and
go

see
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
be
just

<EOS>
I
chid
him
for
come
so
late
;
he
chide
me
for
not

with
him
;
say
he

for
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
go
and
sit
with
Mr.
Lewis
till
just
now
,
and
it
be
past
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
in
the
same
house
with
the

,
one
of
the
Prebendary

house
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
be
not
come
from
his
apartment
in
the
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
that
abominable
dog
Patrick
be
out
after
two
to
-
day
,
and
I
in
a
fright
every
moment
,
for
fear
the
chariot
should
come
;
and
when
he
come
in
,
he
have
not
put
up
one
rag
of
my
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
in
a
great
passion
,
and
would
certainly
have
crop
one
of
his
ear
,
if
I
have
not
look
every
moment
for
the
Secretary
,
who
send
his
equipage
to
my
lodging
before
,
and
come
in
a
chair
from
Whitehall
to
me
,
and
happen
to
stay
half
an

later
than
he
intend
.
 
<EOS>
one

what
manner
I
please
;
because
,
he
say
,
he
desire
to
be
well
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
rage
;
but
my
friend
Lewis
cool
me
,
and
say
it
be
what
the
good
man
sometimes
meet
with
;
and
I
have
be
not
seldom

in
the
like
manner
,
although
not
so
grossly
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
case
I
never
demur
a

,
nor
ever

the

inclination
to
take
anything
.
 
<EOS>
well

I
will

:
 
<EOS>
we
be
a
dozen
in
all
,
three
Scotch
lord
,
and
Lord

.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
would
need
be
witty
,
and
hold
up
my
train
as
I
walk
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
ill
circumstance
that
on
Sundays
much
company
always
meet
at
the
great
table
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
tell
at
court
what
I
say
to
Mr.

on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary

"
say
I
,
"
show
me
a
bill
of
company

<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
conscience
,
I
fear
I
shall
have
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
feel
pain
about
my
foot
and
toe
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
drink
till
within
these
two
year
,
and
I
do
it
to
cure
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
sit
evening
with
some
of
these
people
,
and
drink
in
my
turn
;
but
I
be
now
resolve
to
drink
ten
time
less
than
before
;
but
they
advise
me
to
let
what
I
drink
be
all
wine
,
and
not
to
put
water
to
it
.
<EOS>
Tooke
and
the
printer
stay
to

day
to
finish
their
affair
,
and
treat
me
and
two
of
the
Under

<EOS>
then
I
go
to
see
Lord

,
and
chid
him
for
not

notice
of
me
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he

a
place
for
me
yesterday
at
dinner
,
and
expect
me
there
;
but
I
be
glad
I
do
not
go
,
because
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
be
there
,
and
that
would
have
make
us
acquaint
;
which
I
have
no
mind
to

<EOS>
however
,
we
appoint

,
like

<EOS>
Dingley

<EOS>

Mr.

give
me
a
warrant
for

buck
;
I

and
I

at
Windsor
by

,
where
I
can
have
more
leisure
to
do
some
business
that
concern
them
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
the

think
to
mortify
me
;
for
they
tell
me
they

of
me

to
the

and
she

,
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

a
thousand
pound
a

Hampton
Court
,
and
be
the
only
mark
of
magnificence
or
hospitality

can
see
in
the
Queen

family
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
design
to
entertain
foreign
Ministers

<EOS>
if

I

<EOS>
It

thank
for

their
solicitor

but
I

of
no

<EOS>
do
you

the
greatness
of
my
spirit

that
I
value
their

my
Lord
Treasurer
's
action
,
wherein
the
Duke
of

no
more
share

a
cat
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

any
good
effect
by
your
water
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks

slowly
;

Saturday
since
it

begin
,
and

<EOS>

<EOS>
Faith
,
I
be
so
tosticated
to
and
from
Windsor
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
not
what
to
say
;
but
,
faith
,
I
will
go
to
Windsor
again
on
Saturday
,
if
they
ask
me
,
not
else
.
 
<EOS>
so
lose
your
money
again
,
now
you
be
come
home
;
do
,
sirrah
.
  
<EOS>
take
your
magnifying
-
glass
,
Madam
Dingley
.
  
<EOS>
You
shall
not
read
this
,
sirrah
Stella
;
do
not
read
it
for
your
life
,
for
fear
of
your
dear
eye
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
enough
for
this
side
;
these
Ministers
hinder
me
.
 
<EOS>
pretty
,
dear
,
little
,
naughty
,
saucy
MD

<EOS>
silly

impudent
,
loggerhead
Presto

<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
dilly
<EOS>
and
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Lord
Abercorn
,
and
have
a
fine
fat
haunch
of
venison
,
that
smell
rarely
on
one
side
:
 
and
after
dinner
dilly
win
half
a
crown
of
me
at
backgammon
at
his
lodging
,
to
his
great
content
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
scurvy
empty
town
this
melancholy
season
of
the
year
;
but
I
think
our
weather
begin
to
mend
.
 
<EOS>
the
road
be
as
deep
as
in
winter
.
 
<EOS>
the
grape
be
sad
thing
;
but
the
peach
be
pretty
good
,
and
there
be
some
fig
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
venture
to
eat
one
,
but
always
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
nothing
of
the
box
send
half
a
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
pay
me
for
Mrs.
Walls
's
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
be
in
the
country
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
send
me
the
account
of
MD
,
Madam
Dingley
,
as
it
stand
since
November
,
that
be
to
say
,
for
this
year
(
exclude
the
twenty
pound
lend
Stella
for
Wexford
)
,
for
I
can
not
look
in
your
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
order
that
Hawkshaw
's
interest
should
be
pay
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
when
you
think
proper
,
I
will
let
Parvisol
know
you
have
pay
that
twenty
pound
,
or
part
of
it
;
and
so
go
play
with
the
Dean
,
and
I
will
answer
your
letter
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
,
sirrah
,

,

good

.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
chid
me
for
not
dine
with
him
yesterday
,
<EOS>
for
it
seem
I
do
not
understand
his
invitation
;
and
their
club
of
the
Ministry
dine
together
,
and
expect
me
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Radnor
and
I
be
walk
the
Mall
this
evening
;
and
Mr.
Secretary
meet
us
,
and
take
a
turn
or
two
,
and
then
steal
away
,
and
we
both
believe
it
be
to
pick
up
some
wench
;
and
to
-
morrow
he
will
be
at
the
Cabinet
with
the
Queen
:
 
so
go
the
world
!
<EOS>
prior
have
be
out
of
town
<EOS>
these
two
month
,
nobody
know
where
,
and
be
lately
return
.
 
<EOS>
People
confidently
affirm
he
have
be
in
France
,
and
I
half
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
he
be
send
by
the
Ministry
,
and
for
some
overture
towards
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
pretend
<EOS>
he
know
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
your
Parliament
will
be
dissolve
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
talk
about
the
quarrel
between
your
Lords
and
Commons
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
do
,
at
the
request
of
some
people
,
desire
that
the
Queen
's
answer
to
the
Commons
'
address
may
express
a
dislike
of
some
principle
,
etc
.
;
but
be
answer
dubiously
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
now
to
your
letter
,
fair
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
drinking
be
bad
;
I
mean
writing
be
bad
in
drink
the
water
;
and
be
angry
to
see
so
much
in
Stella
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
Dingley
drink
them
,
I
can
not
imagine
;
but
truly
she
will
drink
water
as
well
as
Stella
:
 
<EOS>
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
now
find
the
benefit
of
them
since
you
be
return
;
pray
let
me
know
particularly
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
be
force
upon
exercise
,
which
,
I
believe
,
be
as
good
as
the
water
for
the
heart
of
them
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
now
past
the
middle
of
August
;
so
by
your
reckoning
you
be
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
It
would
vex
me
to
the
dog
that
letter
should
miscarry
between
Dublin
and
Wexford
,
after
"
scape
the
salt
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
no
more
to
that
nasty
town
in
haste
again
,
I
warrant
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
four
sunday
together
at
Windsor
,
of
which
a
fortnight
together
;
but
I
believe
I
shall
not
go
to
-
morrow
,
for
I
will
not
,
unless
the
Secretary
ask
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
your
news
about
the
Mayor
:
 
<EOS>
it
make
no
noise
here
at
all
,
but
the
quarrel
of
your
Parliament
do
;
it
be
so
very
extraordinary
,
and
the
language
of
the
Commons
so
very
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
the
Examiner
have
be
down
this
month
,
and
be
very
silly
the
five
or
six
last
paper
;
but
there
be
a
pamphlet
come
out
,
in
answer
to
a
letter
to
the
seven
Lords
who
examine
Gregg
.
 
<EOS>
the
Answer
be
by
the
real
author
of
the
Examiner
,
as
I
believe
;
for
it
be
very
well
write
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
Trapp
's
poem
on
the
Duke
of
Ormond
print
here
,
and
the
printer
sell
just
eleven
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
'
tis
a
dull
piece
,
not
half
so
good
as
Stella
's
;
and
<EOS>
she
be
very
modest
to
compare
herself
with
such
a
poetaster
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
sorry
for
poor
Mrs.
Parnell
's
death
;
she
seem
to
be
an
excellent
good
-
natured
young
woman
,
and
I
believe
the
poor
lad
be
much
afflict
;
they
appear
to
live
perfectly
well
together
.
 
<EOS>
dilly
be
not
tired
at
all
with
England
,
but
intend
to
continue
here
a
good
while
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
mighty
easy
to
be
at
distance
from
his
two
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
some
sort
of
scrub
acquaintance
;
go
now
and
then
in
disguise
to
a
play
;
smoke
his
pipe
;
read
now
and
then
a
little
trash
,
and
what
else
the
Lord
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
and
then
;
for
he
call
here
,
and
the
town
be
thin
,
I
be
less
pestered
with
company
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
rid
of
many
of
my
solicitor
,
by
do
nothing
for
them
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
above
eight
or
nine
left
,
and
I
will
be
as
kind
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
do
I
tell
you
of
a
knight
who
desire
me
to
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
to
give
him
two
thousand
pound
,
or
five
hundred
pound
a
year
,
until
he
could
get
something
well
?
 
<EOS>
I
honestly
deliver
my
message
to
the
Treasurer
,
add
,
the
knight
be
a
puppy
,
whom
I
would
not
give
a
groat
to
save
from
the
gallow
.
 
<EOS>
Cole
Reading
's
father
-
in
-
law
have
be
two
or
three
time
at
me
,
to
recommend
his
light
to
the
Ministry
,
assure
me
that
a
word
of
mine
would
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
that
dog
use
to
speak
ill
of
me
,
and
profess
to
hate
me
?
 
<EOS>
He
know
not
where
I
lodge
,
for
I
tell
him
I
live
in
the
country
;
and
I
have
order
Patrick
to
deny
me
constantly
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
do
the
Bishop
of
London
die
in
Wexford
?
<EOS>
poor
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
do
he
drink
the
water
?
<EOS>
be
you
at
his
burial
?
<EOS>
be
it
a
great
funeral
?
<EOS>
so
far
from
his
friend
!
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
very
old
:
 
<EOS>
we
shall
all
follow
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
a
pity
,
if
God
please
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
man
;
not
very
learned
:
I
believe
he
die
but
poor
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
leave
any
charity
legacy
?
<EOS>
who
hold
up
his
pall
?
<EOS>
be
there
a
great
sight
of
clergy
?
<EOS>
do
they
design
a
tomb
for
him
?
  
<EOS>
be
you
sure
it
be
the
Bishop
of
London
?
<EOS>
because
there
be
an
elderly
gentleman
here
that
we
give
the
same
title
to
:
 
or
do
you
fancy
all
this
in
your
water
,
as
other
do
strange
thing
in
their
wine
?
 
<EOS>
They
say
these
water
trouble
the
head
,
and
make
people
imagine
what
never
come
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
make
no
more
of
kill
a
Bishop
?
<EOS>
be
these
your
whiggish
trick
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
see
you
be
in
a
fret
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
<EOS>
,
say
you
,
saucy
Presto
,
I
will
break
your
head
;
what
,
can
not
one
report
what
one
hear
,
without
be
make
a
jest
and
a
laughing
-
stock
?
 
<EOS>
be
these
your
english
trick
,
with
a
murrain
?
 
<EOS>
and
Sacheverell
will
be
the
next
Bishop
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
glad
of
an
addition
of
two
hundred
pound
a
year
to
what
he
have
,
and
that
be
more
than
they
will
give
him
,
for
aught
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
hate
the
new
Ministry
mortally
,
and
they
hate
him
,
and
pretend
to
despise
him
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
not
allow
him
to
have
be
the
occasion
of
the
late
change
;
at
least
some
of
them
will
not
:
 
<EOS>
but
my
Lord
Keeper
own
it
to
me
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
Mr.
Addison
do
not
go
to
Ireland
this
year
:
 
<EOS>
he
pretend
he
would
;
but
he
be
go
to
Bath
with
Pastoral
Philips
,
for
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
I
have
run
over
your
letter
;
and
I
think
this
shall
go
to
-
morrow
,
which
will
be
just
a
fortnight
from
the
last
,
and
bring
thing
to
the
old
form
again
,
after
your
ramble
to
Wexford
,
and
mine
to
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
not
many
literal
fault
in
my
letter
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
read
them
over
,
and
I
fancy
there
be
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
do
then
?
<EOS>
do
you
guess
my
meaning
,
or
be
you
acquaint
with
my
manner
of
mistake
?
 
<EOS>
I
lose
my
handkerchief
in
the
Mall
to
-
night
with
Lord
Radnor
;
but
I
make
him
walk
with
me
to
find
it
,
and
find
it
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
Tisdall
(
that
lodge
with
me
)
and
I
have
have
no
conversation
,
nor
do
we
pull
off
our
hat
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
cousin
of
his
(
I
suppose
,
)
a
young
parson
,
that
lodge
in
the
house
too
;
a
handsome
,
genteel
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Dick
Tighe
and
his
wife
lodge
over
against
us
;
and
he
have
be
see
,
out
of
our
upper
window
,
beat
her
two
or
three
time
:
 
<EOS>
they
be
both
go
to
Ireland
,
but
not
together
;
and
he
solemnly
vow
never
to
live
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
neighbour
do
not
stick
to
say
that
she
have
a
tongue
:
 
in
short
,
I
be
tell
she
be
the
most
urging
,
provoking
devil
that
ever
be
bear
;
and
he
a
hot
,
whiffle
puppy
,
very
apt
to
resent
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
keep
this
bottom
till
to
-
morrow
:
<EOS>
I
be
sleepy
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
with
the
Secretary
this
morning
,
<EOS>
who
be
in
a
mighty
hurry
,
and
go
to
Windsor
in
a
chariot
with
Lord
Keeper
;
so
I
be
not
invite
,
and
be
force
to
stay
at
home
,
but
not
at
all
against
my
will
;
for
I
could
have
go
,
and
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
with
one
of
my
printer
,
for
whom
I
get
the
Gazette
,
and
be
come
home
early
;
and
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
more
,
but
finish
this
letter
,
and
not
send
it
by
the
bellman
.
 
<EOS>
day
grow
short
,
and
the
weather
grow
bad
,
and
the
town
be
splenetic
,
and
thing
be
so
oddly
contrived
that
I
can
not
be
absent
;
otherwise
I
would
go
for
a
few
day
to
Oxford
,
as
I
promise
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
it
be
certain
that
Prior
have
be
in
France
<EOS>
,
nobody
doubt
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
time
to
ask
the
Secretary
,
he
be
in
such
haste
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
take
my
leave
of
dear
MD
for
a
while
;
for
I
must
begin
my
next
letter
to
-
night
:
 
<EOS>
consider
that
,
young
woman
;
and
pray
be
merry
,
and
good
girl
,
and
love
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
now
but
one
business
the
Ministry
want
me
for
,
and
when
that
be
do
,
I
will
take
my
leave
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
get
a
penny
from
them
,
nor
expect
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
some
thing
stand
very
ticklish
;
I
dare
say
nothing
at
this
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dear
sirrah
,
dearest
live
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
peace
and
quiet
with
MD
,
and
nowhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
not
leisure
here
to
think
of
small
thing
,
which
may
ruin
them
;
and
I
have
be
forward
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
again
<EOS>
,
dearest
rogue
;
I
be
never
happy
<EOS>
but
when
I
write
or
think
of
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
enough
of
Courts
and
Ministries
,
and
wish
I
be
at
Laracor
;
and
if
I
could
with
honour
come
away
this
moment
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
bernage
come
to
see
me
to
-
day
;
he
be
just
land
from
Portugal
,
and
come
to
raise
recruit
;
he
look
very
well
,
and
seem
pleased
with
his
station
and

It

since

and
I
reckon
you

now
quiet
at
home
,
and
think
to
begin
your
19th
,
which
will
be
full
of
your
quarrel
between
the
two
Houses
,
all
which
I
know
already
.
 
<EOS>
where
shall
I
dine
to

?
<EOS>

<EOS>
Mrs.
Vanhomrigh

and

and

when
I

at

and
all
my

be
go

of

,
and
your

<EOS>
but

sirrah
;
for
Presto
be
go
to
be
very
busy
;
not
presto
,
but
the
other
I.
  
26
.
 
<EOS>
People
have
so
leave
the
town
that
I
be
at
a
loss
for
a
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
time
since
I
have
be
at
London
upon
a
Sunday
;
and
the
Ministers
be
all
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
eighteenpence
in
coach
-
hire
before
I
could
find
a
place
to
dine
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
Frankland
's
,
and
he
be
abroad
,
and
the
drab
his
wife
look
out
at
window
,
and
bow
to
me
without
invite
me
up
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
dine
with
Mr.
Coote
,
my
Lord
Mountrath
's
brother
;
my
lord
be
with
you
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
this
morning
at
five
my
Lord
Jersey
die
of
the
gout
in
his
stomach
,
or
apoplexy
,
or
both
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
abroad
yesterday
,
and
his
death
be
sudden
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
Chamberlain
to
King
William
,
and
a
great
favourite
,
turn
out
by
the
Queen
as
a
Tory
,
and
stand
now
fair
to
be
Privy
seal
;
and
by
his
death
will
,
I
suppose
,
make
that
matter
easy
,
which
have
be
a
very
stubborn
business
at
Court
,
as
I
have
be
inform
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
remember
so
many
people
of
quality
to
have
die
in
so
short
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
-
day
into
the
City
,
to
thank
Stratford
for
my
book
,
and
dine
with
him
,
and
settle
my
affair
of
my
money
in
the
Bank
,
and
receive
a
bill
for
Mrs.
Wesley
for
some
thing
I
be
to
buy
for
her
;
and
the
d
#
#
#
#
a
one
of
all
these
could
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
merchant
be
all
out
of
town
,
and
I
be
force
to
go
to
a
little
hedge
place
for
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
May
my
enemy
live
here
in
summer
!
<EOS>
and
yet
I
be
so
unlucky
that
I
can
not
possibly
be
out
of
the
way
at
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
People
leave
the
town
so
late
in
summer
,
and
return
so
late
in
winter
,
that
they
have
almost
invert
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
autumn
<EOS>
this
good
while
in
St.
James
's
Park
;
the
lime
have
be
lose
their
leave
,
and
those
remain
on
the
tree
be
all
parched
:
 
<EOS>
I
hate
this
season
,
where
everything
grow
bad
and
bad
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
good
thing
of
it
be
the
fruit
,
and
that
I
dare
not
eat
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
any
fruit
at
Wexford
?
 
<EOS>
a
few
cherry
,
and
durst
not
eat
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
hear
we
have
yet
get
a
new
Privy
Seal
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
whisper
that
our
new
Ministry
differ
among
themselves
,
and
they
begin
to
talk
out
Mr.
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
they
have
some
reason
for
their
whisper
,
although
I
think
it
be
a
great
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
much
like
the
posture
of
thing
;
I
always
apprehend
that
any
fall
out
would
ruin
them
,
and
so
I
have
tell
them
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
be
mighty
full
of
hope
at
present
;
and
whatever
be
the
matter
,
all
kind
of
stock
fall
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
talk
with
the
Secretary
about
Prior
's
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
apt
to
think
it
may
foretell
a
peace
,
and
that
be
all
we
have
to
preserve
us
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
be
not
come
from
Windsor
,
but
I
expect
him
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
burn
all
politic
!
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
We
begin
to
have
fine
weather
,
and
I
walk
to
-
day
to
Chelsea
,
and
dine
with
the
Dean
of
Carlisle
,
who
be
lay
up
with
the
gout
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
fix
that
he
be
to
be
Dean
of
Christ
Church
in
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
advise
him
to
use
his
interest
to
prevent
any
misunderstanding
between
our
Ministers
;
but
he
be
too
wise
to
meddle
,
though
he
fear
the
thing
and
the
consequence
as
much
as
I.
He
will
get
into
his
own
warm
,
quiet
deanery
,
and
leave
them
to
themselves
;
and
he
be
in
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
home
to
-
night
,
I
find
a
letter
from
Mr.
Lewis
,
who
be
now
at
Windsor
;
and
in
it
,
forsooth
,
another
which
look
like
Presto
's
hand
;
and
what
should
it
be
but
a
19th
from
MD
?
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
<EOS>
,
I
"
scape
narrowly
,
for
I
send
my
28th
but
on
Saturday
;
and
what
should
I
have
do
if
I
have
two
letter
to
answer
at
once
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
another
from
Wexford
,
that
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
must
be
content
;
but
you
be
dear
saucy
girl
,
for
all
that
,
to
write
so
soon
again
,
faith
;
an't
you
?
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Lord
Abercorn
,
and
take
my
leave
of
them
:
 
<EOS>
they
set
out
to
-
morrow
for
Chester
,
and
,
I
believe
,
will
now
fix
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
make
a
pretty
good
journey
of
it
:
 
his
eld
son
be
married
to
a
lady
with
ten
thousand
pound
;
and
his
second
son
have
,
t'other
day
,
get
a
prize
in
the
lottery
of
four
thousand
pound
,
beside
two
small
one
of
two
hundred
pound
each
:
 
<EOS>
nay
,
the
family
be
so
fortunate
,
that
my
lord
bestow
one
ticket
,
which
be
a
hundred
pound
,
to
one
of
his
servant
,
who
have
be
his
page
,
the
young
fellow
get
a
prize
,
which
have
make
it
another
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
the
evening
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
desire
I
will
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
,
when
he
will
show
me
the
answer
he
design
to
return
to
the
letter
of
thank
from
your
bishop
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
desire
me
to
get
myself
mention
in
the
answer
which
my
lord
would
send
;
but
I
send
him
word
I
would
not
open
my
lip
to
my
lord
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
would
convince
the
bishop
of
what
I
have
affirm
,
that
the
first
-
fruit
be
grant
before
the
Duke
of
Ormond
be
declare
Governor
;
and
I
writ
to
him
that
I
would
not
give
a
farthing
to
convince
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Treasurer
begin
a
health
to
my
Lord
Privy
Seal
:
 
prior
pun
,
and
say
it
be
so
privy
,
he
know
not
who
it
be
;
but
I
fancy
they
have
fix
it
all
,
and
we
shall
know
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
care
you
who
be
Privy
Seal
,
saucy
sluttikin
?
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
out
this
morning
,
I
be
surprised
with
the
news
that
the
Bishop
of
Bristol
be
make
Lord
Privy
Seal
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
his
name
be
Robinson
,
and
that
he
be
many
year
Envoy
in
Sweden
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
friend
of
the
present
Ministry
be
extremely
glad
,
and
the
clergy
above
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
will
fret
to
death
to
see
a
civil
employment
give
to
a
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
handsome
thing
in
my
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
will
bind
the
Church
to
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
dine
with
him
to
-
day
,
but
he
have
not
write
his
letter;[see
above
,
29th
August
]
but
tell
me
he
would
not
offer
to
send
it
without
show
it
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
he
think
that
would
not
be
just
,
since
I
be
so
deeply
concerned
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
We
have
much
company
:
 
Lord
Rivers
,
Mar
,
and
Kinnoull
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
George
Granville
,
and
Masham
:
 
the
last
have
invite
me
to
the
christening
of
his
son
to

morrow
se'ennight
;
and
on
Saturday
I
go
to
Windsor
with
Mr.
Secretary

<EOS>

<EOS>
dilly
<EOS>
and
I

for
some
time
:
 
<EOS>
he
dress
himself
like
a
beau
,
and
no
doubt
make
a
fine
figure
.
 
<EOS>
I

lie
very
ill
of
an
ague
,
which
be
a
very
common
disease
here
,
and
little
know
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
be
apt
to
think
we
shall
soon
have
a
peace
,
by
the
little
word
I
hear
throw
out
by
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
think
of
a
project
to
bite
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
that
it
be
now
know
that
Mr.

<EOS>

dictate
to

formal
relation
of

<EOS>

and
I

have
a
great
deal
of
dust
.
 
<EOS>
at
night

<EOS>
Windsor
.
<EOS>
the

Lord
Peterborow
's
house
,
who
have
leave
it
and
his
garden
to
the
Secretary
during
his
absence
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
fine
garden
I
have
ever
see
about
this
town
;
and
abundance
of
hot
wall
for
grape
,
where
they
be
in
great
plenty
,
and
ripen
fast
.
 
<EOS>
I
durst
not
eat
any
fruit
but
one
fig
;
but
I
bring
a
basket
full
to
my
friend
Lewis
here
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
do
Stella
never
eat
any
?
<EOS>
what
,
no
apricot
at
Donnybrook
!
<EOS>
nothing
but
claret
and
ombre
!
 
<EOS>
I
envy
people
maunche
and
maunche
peach
and
grape
,
and
I
not
daring
to
eat
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
My
head
be
pretty
well
,
<EOS>
only
a
sudden
turn
any
time
make
me
giddy
for
a
moment
,
and
sometimes
it
feel
very
stuffed
;
but
if
it
grow
no
bad
,
I
can
bear
it
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
all
opportunity
of
walk
;
and
we
have
a
delicious
park
here
just
join
to
the
Castle
,
and
an
avenue
in
the
great
park
very
wide
and
two
mile
long
,
set
with
a
double
row
of
elm
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
ever
at
Windsor
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
once
,
a

.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
have
the
gout
,
and
do
not
come
to
chapel
,
nor
stir
out
from
her
chamber
,
but
receive
the
sacrament
there
,
as
she
always
do
the
first
Sunday
in
the
month
.
 
<EOS>
yet
we
have
a
great
court
;
and
,
among
other
,
I
see
your
Ingoldsby
,
who
,
see
me
talk
very
familiarly
with
the
Keeper
,
Treasurer
,
etc
.
,
come
up
and
salute
me
,
and
begin
a
very
impertinent
discourse
about
the
siege
of
Bouchain
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
could
not
answer
his
question
,
but
I
would
bring
him
one
that
should
;
so
I
go
and
fetch
Sutton
(
who
bring
over
the
express
about
a
month
ago
)
,
and
deliver
him
to
the
General
,
and
bid
him
answer
his
question
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
leave
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
Sutton
after
some
time
come
back
in
a
rage
,
find
me

complain
of
the
trick
I
have
play
him
,
and

<EOS>
but
he

me
Ingoldsby

so

I
suppose

<EOS>
so
we
laugh
,
etc
.
<EOS>
My

only
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
tell
him

<EOS>
You
be
still
at
Wexford
,
as
you
say
,
Madam
Dingley
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
no
letter
from
me
ever
yet
miscarry
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
Inish
-
corthy
,
and
the
river
Slainy
<EOS>
;
fine
word
those
in
a
lady
's
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Your
hand
like
Dingley
's
<EOS>
,
you
scamble
,
scatter
sluttikin
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
MIGHTY
like
INDEED
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
Pisshh
,
do
not
talk
of
writing
or
read
till
your
eye
be
well
,
and
long
well
;
only
I
would
have
Dingley
read
sometimes
to
you
,
that
you
may
not
lose
the
desire
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
be
thank
,
that
the
ugly
numbing
be
go
!
 
<EOS>
pray
use
exercise
when
you
go
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
what
game
be
that
ombra
which
Dr.
Elwood
and
you
play
at
?
<EOS>
be
it
the
spanish
game
ombre
?
 
<EOS>
Your
card
-
purse
?
<EOS>
you
a
card
-
purse
!
<EOS>
you
a
fiddlestick
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
luck
indeed
;
and
luck
in
a
bag
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
devil
!
<EOS>
be
that
eight
-
shill
tea
-
kettle
copper
,
or
tin
japan
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
your
irish
politeness
,
raffle
for
tea
-
kettle
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
splutter
you
keep
,
to
convince
me
that
Walls
have
no
taste
!
 
<EOS>
My
head
continue
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
write
,
dear
sirrah
<EOS>
Stella
,
when
you
find
your
eye
so
weak
that
you
can
not
see
?
<EOS>
what
comfort
be
there
in
read
what
you
write
,
when
one
know
that
?
 
<EOS>
so
Dingley
can
not
write
,
because
of
the
clutter
of
new
company
come
to
Wexford
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
noise
of
their
hundred
horse
disturb
you
;
or
do
you
lie
in
one
gallery
,
as
in
an
hospital
?
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
you
be
afraid
of
lose
in
Dublin
the
acquaintance
you
have
get
in
Wexford
,
and
chiefly
the
Bishop
of
Raphoe
,
an
old
,
doting
,
perverse
coxcomb
?
 
<EOS>
twenty
at
a
time
at
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
like
five
pound
at
a
time
,
when
it
be
never
but
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
Madam
Dingley
,
you
be
apt
to
lie
in
your
travel
,
though
not
so
bad
as
Stella
;
she
tell
thumper
,
as
I
shall
prove
in
my
next
,
if
I
find
this
receive
encouragement
.
 
<EOS>
so
Dr.
Elwood
say
there
be
a
world
of
pretty
thing
in
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
a
pox
on
his
praise
!
<EOS>
an
enemy
here
would
say
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
would
say
as
much
,
though
he
and
I
be
terribly
fallen
out
;
and
the
great
man
be
perpetually
inflame
me
against
him
:
 
<EOS>
they
bring
me
all
he
say
of
me
,
and
,
I
believe
,
make
it
bad
out
of
roguery
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
'
tis
<EOS>
not
your
pen
be
bewitch

Madam
Stella

but
your

Farewell

we

a

and
I

<EOS>
when
Stella
say
her

be
bewitch
,
it
be
only
because
there
be
a

<EOS>
You

the
fellow
they
call
God

it
have
the

<EOS>
I

and
I
unfold
the

to
tell
you

<EOS>
cut
off
those

Pray

the

<EOS>
I

you
shall
not

that
be
the
short

<EOS>
o

how
stout
Presto

as
hope

ten
million

etc

<EOS>
etc
.
  
<EOS>
I
open
my
letter
once
more
,
to
tell
Stella
that
if
she
do
not
use
exercise
after
her
water
,
it
will
lose
all
the
effect
of
them
:
 
I
should

not
take
all
opportunity
of

Pray

.
 
<EOS>
It
be
seven
before
we
sit
down
to
dinner
,
and
I
stay
till
past
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
Patrick
come
home
with
the
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
more
plague
with
Patrick
and
my
portmantua
than
with
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
when
I
go
to
Windsor
on
Saturday
I
overtook
Lady
Giffard
and
Mrs.
Fenton
in
a
chariot
,
go
,
I
suppose
,
to
Sheen
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
then
in
a
chariot
too
,
of
Lord
Treasurer
's
brother
,
who
have
business
with
the
Treasurer
;
and
my
lord
come
after
,
and
overtook
me
at
Turnham
Green
,
four
mile
from
London
;
and
then
the
brother
go
back
,
and
I
go
in
the
coach
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
so
it
happen
that
those
people
see
me
,
and
not
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
F.
be
to
see
me
about
a
week
ago
;
and
desire
I
would
get
her
son
into
the
Charter

house
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
this
morning
the
printer
send
me
an
account
of
Prior
's
Journey
;
it
make
a
twopenny
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
see
it
,
for
I
dare
engage
it
will
run
;
'
tis
a
formal
,
grave
lie
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
all
but
about
the
last
page
;
that
I
dictate
,
and
the
printer
writ
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
send
to
me
to
dine
where
he
do
;
it
be
at
Prior
's
:
 
when
I
come
in
,
prior
show
me
the
pamphlet
,
seem
to
be
angry
,
and
say
,
"
here
be
our
english
liberty
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
read
some
of
it
,
and
say
I
like
it
mightily
,
and
envy
the
rogue
the
thought
;
for
,
have
it
come
into
my
head
,
I
should
have
certainly
do
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
We
stay
at
Prior
's
till
past
ten
;
and
then
the
Secretary
receive
a
packet
with
the
news
of
Bouchain
be
take
,
for
which
the
gun
will
go
off
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
prior
own
his
have
be
in
France
,
for
it
be
past
deny
:
 
<EOS>
it
seem
he
be
discover
by
a
rascal
at
Dover
,
who
have
positive
order
to
let
him
pass
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
we
shall
have
a
peace
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
terrible
rainy
weather
,
and
have
cost
me
three
shilling
in
coach
and
chair
to
-
day
,
yet
I
be
dirty
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
three
hour
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
about
some
business
of
moment
,
and
then
go
into
the
city
to
dine
.
 
<EOS>
the
printer
tell
me
he
sell
yesterday
a
thousand
of
Prior
's
Journey
,
and
have
print
five
hundred
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
do
rarely
,
I
believe
,
and
be
a
pure
bite
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
MD
do
all
this
while
?
<EOS>
get
again
to
their
card
,
their
wall
,
their
dean
,
their
Stoytes
,
and
their
claret
?
<EOS>
pray
present
my
service
to
Mr.
Stoyte
and
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
tell
Goody
Stoyte
<EOS>
she
owe
me
a
world
of
dinner
,
and
I
will
shortly
come
over
and
demand
them
.
 
<EOS>
do
I
tell
you
of
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
's
last
letter
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
say
,
in
several
of
his
former
,
that
he
would
shortly
write
to
me
something
about
myself
;
and
it
look
as
if
he
intend
something
for
me
:
 
at
last
out
<EOS>
it
come
,
and
consist
of
two
part
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
he
advise
me
to
strike
in
for
some
preferment
now
<EOS>
I
have
friend
;
and
secondly
,
he
advise
me
,
since
I
have
part
,
and
learning
,
and
a
happy
pen
,
to
think
of
some
new
subject
in
divinity
not
handle
by
other
,
which
I
should
manage
better
than
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
a
rare
spark
this
,
with
a
pox
!
<EOS>
but
I
shall
answer
him
as
rarely
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
he
should
have
invite
me
over
,
and
give
me
some
hope
or
promise
.
 
<EOS>
but
hang
him
!
<EOS>
and
so
good
-
night
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
It
rain
most
furiously
all
this
morning
till
about
twelve
,
and
sometimes
thunder
;
I
tremble
for
my
shilling
,
but
it
clear
up
,
and
I
make
a
shift
to
get
a
walk
in
the
Park
,
and
then
go
with
the
Secretary
to
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
upon
Thursdays
there
be
always
a
select
company
:
we
have
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
,
Lord
Rivers
,
the
two
Secretaries
,
Mr.
Granville
,
and
Mr.
Prior
.
 
<EOS>
half
of
them
go
to
Council
at
six
;
but
Rivers
,
Granville
,
Prior
,
and
I
,
stay
till
eight
.
 
<EOS>
prior
be
often
affect
to
be
angry
at
the
account
of
his
journey
to
Paris
;
and
indeed
the
two
last
page
,
which
the
printer
get
somebody
to
add
,
be
so
romantic
,
they
spoil
all
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Dilly
Ashe
pretend
to
me
that
he
be
only
go
to
Oxford
and
Cambridge
for
a
fortnight
,
and
then
would
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
him
as
I
appoint
t'other
day
;
but
some
of
his
friend
tell
me
he
take
leave
of
them
as
go
to
Ireland
;
and
so
they
say
at
his
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
rogue
be
ashamed
to
tell
me
so
,
because
I
advise
him
to
stay
the
winter
,
and
he
say
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
have
get
into
a
good
set
of
scrub
acquaintance
,
and
I
think
pass
his
time
very
merrily
;
but
I
suppose
he
languish
after
Balderig
,
and
the
claret
of
Dublin
;
and
,
after
all
,
I
think
he
be
in
the
right
;
for
he
can
eat
,
drink
,
and
converse
well
there
than
here
.
 
<EOS>
bernage
be
with
me
this
morning
:
 
<EOS>
he
call
now
and
then
;
he
be
in
terrible
fear
of
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
never
have
his
health
so
well
as
in
Portugal
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
favourite
of
his
Colonel
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
mortify
enough
to
-
day
,
not
know
where
in
the
world
to
dine
<EOS>
,
the
town
be
so
empty
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
H.
Coote
,
and
think
he
would
invite
me
,
but
he
do
not
:
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
Stanley
do
not
come
into
my
head
;
so
I
take
up
with
Mrs.
Van
,
and
dine
with
her
and
her
damned
landlady
,
who
,
I
believe
,
by
her
eyebrow
,
be
a
bawd
.
 
<EOS>
this
evening
I
meet
Addison
and
Pastoral
Philips
in
the
Park
,
and
sup
with
them
at
Addison
's
lodging
:
 
<EOS>
we
be
very
good
company
,
and
I
yet
know
no
man
half
so
agreeable
to
me
as
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
with
them
till
twelve
,
so
you
may
think
it
be
late
,
young
woman
;
however
,
I
would
have
some
little
conversation
with
MD
before
your
presto
go
to
bed
,
because
it
make
me
sleep
,
and
dream
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
this
letter
go
on
slowly
enough
,
sirrah
;
but
I
can
not
write
much
at
a
time
till
you
be
quite
settle
after
your
journey
,
you
know
,
and
have
go
all
your
visit
,
and
lose
your
money
at
ombre
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
play
at
chess
now
,
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
that
put
me
in
mind
of
Dick
Tighe
;
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
tell
you
he
use
to
beat
his
wife
here
;
and
she
deserve
it
;
and
he
resolve
to
part
with
her
;
and
they
go
to
Ireland
in
different
coach
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord
,
I
say
all
this
before
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
go
to
bed
,
sirrah
.
  
<EOS>
Windsor
,
15
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
the
Secretary
stop
at
Brentford
,
because
we
set
out
at
two
this
afternoon
,
and
fast
would
not
agree
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
design
to
eat
a
bit
of
bread
-
and
-
butter
;
but
he
would
light
,
and
we
eat
roast
beef
like
dragon
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
make
me
treat
him
and
two
more
gentleman
;
faith
,
it
cost
me
a
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
such
jesting
,
yet
<EOS>
I
be
mightily
pleased
with
it
too
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
our
Society
meet
at
the
Secretary
's
:
 
there
be
nine
of
us
;
and
we
have
choose
a
new
member
,
the
Earl
of
Jersey
,
whose
father

.
'
<EOS>
Tis

and
I

steal
away
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
stay
here
this
week
by
myself
,
about
some
business
that
lie
on
my
hand
,
and
will
take
up
a
great
deal
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Adams
,
one
of
the
canon
,
invite
me
to
-
day
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
the
table
be
so
full
here
on
Sunday
that
it
be
hard
to
dine
with
a
few
,
and
Dr.
Adams
know
I
love
to
do
so
;
which
be
very
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
see
company
in
her
bed
-
chamber
;
she
look
very
well
,
but
she
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
sup
with
Lord
Treasurer
as
usual
,
and
stay
till
past
one
as
usual
,
and
with
our
usual
company
,
except
Lord
Keeper
,
who
do
not
come
this
time
to
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
these
supper
mortally
,
but
I
seldom
eat
anything
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
Mr.
Secretary
stay
here
till
tomorrow
;
some
business
keep
them
,
and
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
for
they
hinder
me
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
and
I
be
go
to
dine
soberly
with
a
little
Court
friend
at
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
Lord
Harley
and
Lord
Dupplin
keep
me
by
force
,
and
say
we
should
dine
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
who
intend
to
go
at
four
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
like
a
fool
,
and
go
with
the
two
young
lord
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
very
fairly
turn
us
all
three
out
of
door
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
be
invite
to
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
but
he
be
go
to
a
horse
-
race
,
and
would
not
come
till
five
;
so
we
be
force
to
go
to
a
tavern
,
and
send
for
wine
from
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
who
at
last
,
we
be
tell
,
do
not
go
to
town
till
the
morrow
,
and
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
we
sup
again
;
and
I
desire
him
to
let
me
add
four
shilling
to
the
bill
I
give
him
.
<EOS>
We
sit
up
till
two
,
yet
I
must
write
to
little
MD
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
go
early
this
morning
,
and
I
be
alone
to
seek
my
fortune
;
but
Dr.
Arbuthnot
engage
me
for
my
dinner
;
and
he
yesterday
give
me
my
choice
of
place
,
person
,
and
victual
for
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
choose
to
dine
with
Mrs.
Hill
,
who
be
one
of
the
dresser
,
and
Mrs.
Masham
's
sister
,
no
company
but
us
three
,
and
to
have
a
shoulder
of
mutton
,
a
small
one
;
which
be
exactly
,
only
there
be
too
much
victual
besides
;
and
the
Doctor
's
wife
be
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
-
morrow
Mrs.
Hill
and
<EOS>
I
be
to
dine
with
the
Doctor
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
fellow
often
about
court
whom
I
think
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
who
he
be
,
and
they
tell
me
it
be
the
gentleman
porter
;
then
I
call
him
to
mind
;
he
be
Killy
's
acquaintance
(
I
will
not
say
yours
)
;
I
think
his
name
be
Lovet
,
or
Lovel
,
or
something
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
do
not
know
me
,
and
in
my
present
posture
I
shall
not
be
fond
of
renew
old
acquaintance
;
I
believe
I
use
to
see
him
with
the
Bradleys
;
and
,
by
the
way
,
I
have
not
see
Mrs.
Bradley
since
I
come
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
your
letter
in
London
,
like
a
fool
;
and
can
not
answer
it
till
I
go
back
,
which
will
not
be
until
Monday
next
;
so
this
will
be
above
a
fortnight
from
my
last
;
but
I
will
fetch
it
up
in
my
next
;
so
go
and
walk
to
the
Dean
's
for
your
health
this
fine
weather
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
design
to
have
card
and
dance
here
next
week
,
which
make
us
think
she
will
stay
here
longer
than
we
believe
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Masham
be
not
well
after
her
lying
-
in
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
she
get
some
cold
;
she
be
lame
in
one
of
her
leg
with
a
rheumatic
pain
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Arbuthnot
and
Mrs.
Hill
go
tomorrow
to
Kensington
to
see
her
,
and
return
the
same
night
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hill
and
I
dine
with
the
Doctor
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
ride
out
this
morning
with
the
Doctor
to
see
Cranburn
,
a
house
of
Lord
Ranelagh
's
,
and
the
Duchess
of
Marlborough
's
lodge
,
and
the
Park
;
the
fine
place
they
be
,
for
nature
and
plantation
,
that
ever
I
see
;
and
the
fine
riding
upon
artificial
road
,
make
on
purpose
for
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
make
me
draw
up
a
sham
subscription
for
a
book
,
call
a
history
of
the
Maids
of
Honour
since
Harry
the
Eighth
,
show
they
make
the
good
wife
,
with
a
list
of
all
the
maid
of
honour
since
,
etc
.
;
to
pay
a
crown
in
hand
,
and
the
other
crown
upon
delivery
of
the
book
;
and
all
in
common
form
of
those
thing
.
 
<EOS>
We
get
a
gentleman
to
write
it
fair
,
because
my
hand
be
know
;
and
we
send
it
to
the
maid
of
honour
,
when
they
come
to
supper
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
bite
at
it
,
it
will
be
a
very
good
Court
jest
;
and
the
Queen
will
certainly
have
it
:
 
<EOS>
we
do
not
tell
Mrs.
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
to

I

<EOS>
She

bill

<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Ormond
be
censure
here
,
by
those
in

,
for
very
wrong
management
in
the
affair
of

<EOS>
He
be
govern
by
fool
,
and
have
usually
much
more
sense
than
his
adviser
,
but
never

after
Wexford

and
get
somebody

shuttlecock
with
you
,
Madam
Stella

and
walk
to
the
Dean

and
Donnybrook
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Godfrey
send
to
me
again
to
-
day
;
<EOS>
so
I
dine
at
the
Green
Cloth
,
and
we
have
but
eleven
at
dinner
,
which
be
a
small
number
there
,
<EOS>
the
Court
be
always
thin
of
company
till
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
this
new
ink
and
pen
make
a
strange
figure
;
I
MUST
WRITE
LARGER
,
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
I
MUST
,
<EOS>
or
STELLA
WILL
not
be
<EOS>
ABLE
<EOS>
to
read
this
.
 
<EOS>
S.
S.
S.
,
there
be
your
s
's
for
you
,
Stella
.
 
<EOS>
the
maid
of
honour
be
bit
,
and
have
all
contribute
their
crown
,
and
be
tease
other
to
subscribe
for
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
Lord
Keeper
and
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
morrow
;
and
I
believe
the
Queen
will
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
walk
this
evening
,
I
squander
away
the
rest
of
it
in
sit
at
Lewis
's
lodging
,
while
he
and
Dr.
Arbuthnot
play
at
picquet
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
that
foolish
pleasure
,
which
I
believe
nobody
have
beside
me
,
except
old
Lady
Berkeley
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
fret
when
I
come
away
:
 
I
will
loiter
<EOS>
so
no
more
,
for
I
have
a
plaguy
deal
of
business
upon
my
hand
,
and
very
little
time
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
pamphleteer
begin
to
be
very
busy
against
the
Ministry
:
 
I
have
beg
Mr.
Secretary
to
make
example
of
one
or
two
of
them
,
and
he
assure
me
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
bold
and
abusive
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
day
the
Ministry
come
to
Windsor
,
I
eat
a
bit
or
two
at
Mr.
Lewis
's
lodging
,
because
I
must
sup
with
Lord
Treasurer
;
and
at
half
an
hour
after
one
,
I
lead
Mr.
Lewis
a
walk
up
the
avenue
,
which
be
two
mile
long
.
<EOS>
We
walk
in
all
about
five
mile
;
but
I
be
so
tired
with
his
slow
walking
,
that
I
leave
him
here
,
and
walk
two
mile
towards
London
,
hope
to
meet
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
return
with
him
;
but
it
grow
darkish
,
and
I
be
force
to
walk
back
,
so
I
walk
nine
mile
in
all
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
do
not
come
till
after
eight
;
which
be
very
wrong
,
for
there
be
no
moon
,
and
I
often
tell
him
how
ill
he
do
to
expose
himself
so
;
but
he
only
make
a
jest
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
sup
with
him
,
and
stay
till
now
,
when
it
be
half
an
hour
after
two
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
merry
and
careless
and
disengage
as
a
young
heir
at
one
-
and
-
twenty
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
late
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
do
not
come
last
night
,
but
at
three
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
him
yet
,
but
I
verily
think
they
be
contrive
a
peace
as
fast
as
they
can
,
without
which
it
will
be
impossible
to
subsist
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
be
at
church
to
-
day
,
but
be
carry
in
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
and
Mr.
Lewis
dine
privately
with
Mr.
Lowman
,
Clerk
of
the
Kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
see
Lord
Keeper
this
morning
,
and
tell
him
the
jest
of
the
maid
of
honour
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
have
it
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
that
rogue
Arbuthnot
put
it
all
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
Court
be
very
full
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
Lord
Treasurer
would
have
invite
me
to
supper
;
but
he
only
bow
to
me
;
and
we
have
no
discourse
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
seven
at
night
,
and
I
be
at
home
;
and
I
hope
Lord
Treasurer
will
not
send
for
me
to
supper
:
 
if
he
do
not
,
I
will
reproach
him
;
and
he
will
pretend
to
chide
me
for
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
so
farewell
<EOS>
till
I
go
to
bed
,
for
I
be
go
to
be
busy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
past
ten
,
and
I
go
down
to
ask
the
servant
about
Mr.
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
they
tell
me
the
Queen
be
yet
at
Council
,
and
that
she
go
to
supper
,
and
come
out
to
the
Council
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certain
they
be
manage
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
bed
,
and
there
be
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
eleven
,
and
a
messenger
be
come
from
Lord
Treasurer
to
sup
with
them
;
but
I
have
excuse
myself
,
and
be
glad
I
be
in
bed
;
for
else
I
should
sit
up
till
two
,
and
drink
till
I
be
hot
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
will
go
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
24
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
town
by
six
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
have
stay
till
ten
.
 
<EOS>
that
of
the
Queen
's
go
out
to
sup
,
and
come
in
again
,
be
a
lie
,
as
the
Secretary
tell
me
this
morning
;
but
I
find
the
Ministry
be
very
busy
with
Mr.
Prior
,
and
I
believe
he
will
go
again
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
so
much
,
that
we
shall
certainly
have
a
peace
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
charming
weather
all
last
week
at
Windsor
;
but
we
have
have
a
little
rain
to
-
day
,
and
yesterday
be
windy
.
 
<EOS>
Prior
's
Journey
sell
still
;
they
have
sell
two
thousand
,
although
the
town
be
empty
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
a
letter
from
Mrs.
Fenton
here
,
desire
me
,
in
Lady
Giffard
's
name
,
to
come
and
pass
a
week
at
Sheen
,
while
she
be
at
Moor
Park
.
<EOS>
I
will
answer
it
with
a
vengeance
:
 
and
now
you
talk
of
answering
,
there
be
MD
's
n.20
<EOS>
be
yet
to
be
answer
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
it
up
so
safe
<EOS>
,
I
could
hardly
find
it
;
but
here
it
be
,
faith
,
and
I
be
afraid
I
can
not
send
this
till
Thursday
;
for
I
must
see
the
Secretary
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
be
in
some
other
place
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
write
like
an
emperor
,
and
give
such
an
account
of
her
journey
,
never
see
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
<EOS>
;
stand
away
,
let
us
compute
;
you
stay
four
day
at
Inish
-
Corthy
,
two
night
at
Mrs.
Proby
's
mother
's
,
and
yet
be
but
six
day
in
journey
;
for
your
word
be
,
"
We
leave
Wexford
this
day
se'ennight
,
and
come
here
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
them
say
that
"
traveller
may
lie
by
authority
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
make
up
this
,
if
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
how
far
be
it
from
Wexford
to
Dublin
?
<EOS>
how
many
mile
do
you
travel
in
a
day
?
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
 
thirty
pound
in
two
month
be
nine
score
pound
a
year
;
a
matter
of
nothing
in
Stella
's
purse
!
 
<EOS>
I
dream
Billy
Swift
be
alive
,
and
that
I
tell
him
you
writ
<EOS>
me
word
he
be
dead
,
and
that
you
have
be
at
his
funeral
;
<EOS>
and
I
admire
at
your
impudence
,
and
be
in
mighty
haste
to
run
and
let
you
know
what
lie
rogue
you
be
.
<EOS>
poor
lad
!
<EOS>
he
be
dead
of
his
mother
's
former
folly
and
fondness
;
and
yet
now
I
believe
,
as
you
say
,
that
her
grief
will
soon
wear
off
.
 
<EOS>
o
yes
,
Madam
Dingley
,
mightily
tired
of
the
company
,
no
doubt
of
it
,
at
Wexford
!
 
<EOS>
and
your
description
of
it
be
excellent
;
clean
sheet
,
but
bare
wall
;
I
suppose
then
you
lay
upon
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Walls
have
get
her
tea
;
but
who
pay
me
the
money
?
 
<EOS>
come
,
I
shall
never
get
it
;
so
I
make
a
present
of
it
,
to
stop
some
gap
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
the
thank
of
the
house
?
 
<EOS>
so
,
that
be
well
;
why
,
it
cost
four
-
and
-
thirty
shilling
<EOS>
English
 
you
must
adjust
that
with
Mrs.
Walls
;
I
think
that
be
so
many
pence
more
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
Leigh
and
Sterne
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
be
not
at
the
water
-
side
:
 
<EOS>
I
fear
Sterne
's
business
will
not
be
do
;
I
have
not
see
him
<EOS>
this
good
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
him
,
for
the
management
of
that
box
;
and
I
be
the
great
fool
in
nature
for
trust
to
such
a
young
jackanape
;
I
will
speak
to
him
once
more
about
it
,
when
I
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Addison
and
I
meet
once
more
since
,
and
I
sup
with
him
;
I
believe
I
tell
you
so
somewhere
in
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
the
Archbishop
choose
an
admirable
messenger
in
Walls
,
to
send
to
me
;
yet
I
think
him
fitter
for
a
messenger
than
anything
.
 
<EOS>
the
D
#
#
#
#
<EOS>
she
have
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
observe
her
look
.
 
<EOS>
Will
she
rot
out
of
modesty
with
Lady
Giffard
?
<EOS>
I
pity
poor
Jenny
 
b
ut
<EOS>
her
husband
be
a
dunce
,
and
with
respect
to
him
she
lose
little
by
her
deafness
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Madam
Stella
,
in
your
account
you
mistake
one
liquor
for
another
,
and
it
be
an
hundred
and
forty
quart
of
wine
,
and
thirty
-
two
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
write
in
the
morning
before
I
go
to
the
Secretary
,
as
I
be
now
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
answer
your
letter
a
little
short
than
ordinary
;
but
I
have
a
mind
it
should
go
to
-
day
,
and
I
will
give
you
my
journal
at
night
in
my
next
;
for
I
be
so
afraid
of
another
letter
before
this
go
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
have
two
together
again
unanswere
.
 
<EOS>
what
care
I
for
Dr.
Tisdall
and
Dr.
Raymond
,
or
how
many
child
they
have
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
they
have
a
hundred
apiece
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
promise
me
to
answer
the
bishop
'
letter
to
-
morrow
,
and
show
it
me
;
and
I
believe
it
will
confirm
all
I
say
,
and
mortify
those
that
throw
the
merit
on
the
Duke
of
Ormond
;
for
I
have
make
him
jealous
of
it
;
and
t'other
day
,
talk
of
the
matter
,
he
say
,
"
I
be
your
witness
,
you
get
it
for
them
before
the
Duke
be
Lord
Lieutenant

My
humble
service
to
Mrs.
Walls

Mrs.
Stoyte

Catherine

<EOS>
Farewell

etc

<EOS>
what
do
you
do
when
you
see
any
literal
mistake
in
my
letter
?
<EOS>
how
do
you
set
them
right
?
<EOS>
for
I
never
read
them
over
to
correct
them
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell

again

<EOS>
pray
send
this

LETTER
31
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
September
25
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
to
-
day
,
and
at
my
return
I
put
my
30th
into
the
post
-
office
;
and
when
I
get
home
<EOS>
I
find
for
me
one
of
the
noble
letter
I
ever
read
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
from
#
#
#
#
,
 
three
side
and
a
half
in
folio
,
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
;
the
two
first
page
make
up
of
satire
upon
London
,
and
crowd
and
hurry
,
steal
from
some
of
his
own
schoolboy
's
exercise
:
 
the
side
and
a
half
remain
be
spend
in
desire
me
to
recommend
Mrs.
South
,
your
Commissioner
's
widow
,
to
my
Lord
Treasurer
for
a
pension
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
prettiest
,
discreet
fellow
that
ever
my
eye
beheld
,
or
that
ever
dip
pen
into
ink
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
say
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
pox
on
him
<EOS>
,
I
have
too
many
such
customer
on
this
side
already
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
send
him
word
that
I
never
see
my
Lord
Treasurer
in
my
life
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
industriously
avoid
the
name
of
any
great
person
when
I
see
him
,
for
fear
of
his
report
it
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
recommendation
must
be
a
secret
too
,
for
fear
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Bolton
should
know
it
,
and
think
it
be
too
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
read
so
d####d
a
letter
in
my
life
:
 
<EOS>
a
little
would
make
me
send
it
over
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
send
you
a
pattern
,
the
first
place
I
cast
my
eye
on
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
pick
and
choose
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
PLACE
<EOS>
(
mean
the
Exchange
in
London
)
,
which
be
the
COMPENDIUM
of
OLD
TROYNOVANT
,
<EOS>
as
that
be
of
the
whole
busy
world
,
I
got
SUCH
a
surfeit
,
that
<EOS>
I
grow

You

<EOS>
yes

one
little
bit

because
she
will

<EOS>
this
wondrous
theatre
(
mean
London
)
be
no
more
to
me
than
a
desert
,
and
I
should
less
complain
of
solitude
in
a
Connaught
shipwreck
,
or
even
the
great
bog
of
Allen
.
 
<EOS>
a
little

then
I
have
do

their

me
<EOS>
to
be

just
like
a
hive

WORKING
and
labour
under
HUGE
weights
of
CARES

<EOS>
Fanum
be
a
temple
,
but
he
mean
the
Exchange
;
and
Pecunia
be
money
:
 
<EOS>
so
now
Mrs.
Marget
will
understand
her
part
.

that
Dr.
Arbuthnot

put
in
strongly
to

a
captain
over
bernage
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
's
brother
be
but
an
ensign
,
but
the
Doctor
have
great
power
with
the
Queen
:
 
yet
he
tell
me
he
would
not
do
anything
hard
to
a
gentleman
who
be
my
friend
;
and
I
have
engage
the
Secretary
and
his
Colonel
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
To

day
he

me
very
melancholy
,
that
the

Windsor
(
where
he
go

that
he

get

and
Bernage
be
full
of
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
the
Secretary
write
yesterday
a
letter
to
the
Colonel
in
Bernage
's
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it

do
yet
;
and
I
have
write
to
Dr.
Arbuthnot
to
Windsor
,
not
to
insist
on
do
such
a
hardship
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
at
Pontack

,
with
Stratford
;
it
cost
me
seven
shilling
:
 
he
would
have
treat
,
but
I
do
not
let
him

<EOS>
I
have
remove
my
money
from

.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
Parvisol
may
speak
to
Hawkshaw
to

for
I

;
and
,
in

bernage

and
so

I

,
at
Lord

where
I
dine
,
my
brother
,
George
Granville
,
Secretary
at
War
,
after
keep
me
a
while
in
suspense
,
tell
me
that
Dr.
Arbuthnot

,
because
he
would

;
that
his

and
Bernage

I
suppose

<EOS>
bernage
be
now
easy
;
he
have
ten
shilling
a
day
,
beside
lawful
cheating
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
give
a
private
sum
to
his
Colonel
,
but
it
be
very
cheap
:
 
<EOS>
his
Colonel
love
him
well
,
but
be
surprised
to
see
him
have
so
many
friend
.
 
<EOS>
so
he

<EOS>
I

,
at
Lord

handsome
rallying
letter
from

,
to
tell
me

in
compliance
to
me

<EOS>
He

Mr.
Bernage
the

<EOS>
I
be
mighty
well
pleased
to
have
succeed
so
well
;
but
you
will
think
me
tedious
,
although
you

I

but
they

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

never
mistaken
,
and
he
appear
like
a
man
that
be
to
be
rack
to

morrow

<EOS>
I
can
not
but
hope
it
will
not
be
so
bad
;
he
be
a
perfectly
honest
man
,

one
I
have
much
obligation
to

:
 
<EOS>
they

<EOS>
Arbuthnot

the
history
of
the
Maids
of
Honour
;
but
I
tell
her
fairly
it

no
jest
of
mine
;
for
I
find
they
do
not
relish
it
altogether
well
;
and
I
have
enough
already
of
a
quarrel
with
that
brute
Sir
John
Walter
,
who
have
be
rail
at
me
in

ever
since
I

that
I
abuse
the
Queen
's
meat
and
drink
,
and
say
nothing
at
the
table
be
good
,
and
all
a
d####d
lie
;
for
after
dinner
,
commend
the
wine
,
I
say
I
think
it
be
something
small
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
wonder
how
all
my
friend
laugh
at
this
quarrel
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
such
a
jest
for
the
Keeper
,
Treasurer
,
and
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
honest
Colonel
Godfrey
,
take
a
good
walk
of
an
hour
on
the
terrace
,
and
then
come
up

it

bloody
cold

<EOS>
I

but
my

often
invite
me
,
and
I
happen
to
be
disengage
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
worst
provide
table
at
Court
.
 
<EOS>
We
eat
on
pewter
:
<EOS>
every
chaplain
,
when
he
be
make
a
dean
,
give
a
piece
of
plate
,
and
so
they
have
get
a
little
,
some
of
it
very
old
.
 
<EOS>
one
who
be
make
Dean
of
Peterborough
(
a
small
deanery
)
say
he
would
give
no
plate
;
he

<EOS>
the
news

and
I

to
visit
Mrs.
Masham
and
Mrs.
Hill
,
his
two
sister
,
to
condole
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
advise

by
all
mean
to
go
to
the
music
-
meeting
to

night
,
to
show
they
be
not
cast
down
,
etc
.
,
and
they
think
my
advice
be
right
,
and
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
Mr.
Hill
and
his
admiral
make
wrong
step
;
however
,
we
lay
it
all
to
a
storm
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
I

with
the
Secretary
at
supper
;
then
we
both
go

Lord
Treasurer
's
supper
,
and
sit

<EOS>
the
Secretary
be
much
mortify
about
Hill
,
because
this
expedition
be
of
his
contrive
,
and
he
count
much
upon
it
;
but
Lord
Treasurer
be
just
as
merry
as
usual
,
and
old
laughing
at
Sir
John
Walter
and
me
fall
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
grieve
me
but
that
they
would
take
example
,
and
perhaps
presume
upon
it
,
and
get
out
of
my
government
;
but
that
I
think
I
be
not
oblige
to
govern
bear
,
though
I
govern
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
promise
to
be
as
obedient
as
ever
,
and
so
we
laugh
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
bed
;
for
it
be
cold
still
,
and
you
have
a

She

me
that
twenty
people
have
send
her
the
verse
upon
Biddy
,
as
mean
to
her
:
 
and
,
indeed
,
in
point
of
handsomeness
,
she
deserve
them
much
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
to
Windsor
to
-
morrow
,
and
so
I
tell
the
Secretary
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
the
thought
of
Saturday
and
Sunday
supper
with
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Hill
be
come
home
from
his
unfortunate
expedition
,
and
be
,
I
think
,
now
at
Windsor
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
privately
blame
by
his
own
friend
for
want
of
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
He
call
a
council
of
war
,
and
therein
it
be
determined
to
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
say
a
general
should
not
do
that
,
because
the
officer
will
always
give
their
opinion
for
return
,
since
the
blame
will
not
lie
upon
them
,
but
the
general
.
 
<EOS>
I
pity
him
heartily
.
<EOS>
bernage

Governor
of
Barbadoes
;

Sterne
,
to
whom
I
trust
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
have
refuse
Sterne
's

and
I
doubt
he
be
a
rake
;
Jemmy
Leigh

for
him

find
him
.

gallant
,
about

and
I

,
for
fear
of

<EOS>
,
I
do

<EOS>
I

write
to
Ned
Southwell
,
to
desire
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
speak
to
his
reverence
,
that
he
may
leave
off
his
impertinence
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
pox
can
they
think
I
be

<EOS>
You
have
a
pretty
notion
of
me
in
Ireland
,
to
make
me
an
agent
for
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
why
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
value
your
people
's
ingratitude
about
my
part
in
serve
them
?
 
<EOS>
I
remit
them
their
first
-
fruit
of
ingratitude
,
as
freely
as
I
get
the
other
remit
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lord
Treasurer
defer
write
his
letter
to
them
,
or
else
they
would
be
plaguily
confound
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
design
to
give
the
merit
of
it
wholly
to
the
Queen
and
me
,
and
to
let
them
know
it
be
do
before
the
Duke
of

Lord
Lieutenant

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
have

<EOS>
She

in
her
young

.
 
<EOS>
I

Madam
Dingley
;
but
the

promise
.
 
<EOS>
yes

only

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
You
talk
of
my

some
great
folk

<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
tell
me
last
night
that
he
have
find
the
reason
why
the
Queen
be
cold
to
him
for
some
month
past
;
that
a
friend
have
tell
it
him
yesterday
;
and
it
be
,
that
they
suspect
he
be
at
the
bottom
with
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
say
he
have
reflect
upon
all
I
have
speak
to
him
long
ago
,
but
he
think
it
have
only
be
my
suspicion
,
and
my
zeal
and
kindness
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
have
reason
to
take
that
very
ill
,
to
imagine
I
know
so
little
of
the
world
as
to
talk
at
a
venture
to
a
great
Minister
;
that
I
have
go
between
him
and
Lord
Treasurer
often
,
and
tell
each
of
them
what
I
have
say
to
the
other
,
and
that
I
have
inform
him
so
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
all
that
you
may
imagine
to
excuse
himself
,
and
approve
my
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
know
all
along
that
this
proceeding
of
mine
be
the
sure
way
to
send
me
back
to
my
willow
in
Ireland
,
but
that
I
regard
it
not
,
provide
I
could
do
the
kingdom
service
in
keep
them
well
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
mind
him
how
often
I
have
tell
Lord
Treasurer
,
Lord
Keeper
,
and
him
together
,
that
all
thing
depend
on
their
union
,
and
that
my
comfort
be
to
see
them
love
one
another
;
and
I
have
tell
them
all
singly
that
I
have
not
say
this
by
chance
,
etc
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
rage
to
be
thus
suspect
;
swear
he
will
be
upon
a
well
foot
,
or
none
at
all
;
and
I
do
not
see
how
they
can
well
want
him
in
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
find
a
way
of
settle
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
act
an
honest
part
,
that
will
bring
me
neither
honour
nor
praise
.
 
<EOS>
MD
must
think
the
well
of
me
for
it
:
 
nobody
else
shall
ever
know
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
politic
enough
for
once
;
but
Madam
DD
give
me
occasion
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
tell
you

<EOS>
I
han't

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
I
wonder

nothing
of
Dilly
's
be
get
to
Ireland
;
if
he
be
not
there
soon
,
I
shall
have
some
certain
odd
thought
:
 
guess
them
if
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
to

day
with
Dr.
Freind
,
at
one
of
my

<EOS>
I

for
Leigh

but
could
not
find
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
forget
what
sort
of
apron
you
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
rout
among
your
letter
,
a
needle
in
a
bottle
of
hay
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
sterne
direction
,
but
where
to
find

Lord

<EOS>
I
have
bespeak
the
spectacle
;
get
a
set
of
examiner
,
and
five
pamphlet
,
which
I
have
either
write
or
contribute
to
,
except
the
good
,
which
be
the
vindication
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
and
be
entirely
of
the
author
of
the
Atalantis

<EOS>
I
have
settle
Dingley
's
affair
with
Tooke
,
who
have
undertake
it

<EOS>
I
have
bespeak
a
Miscellany
:
 
<EOS>
what
would
you
have
me
do
more
?
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
shill
come
home
;
it
rain
terribly
,
and
do
so
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
have
have
an
ill
day
,
in
much
pain
.
 
<EOS>
He

and
do
business
in

<EOS>
now
he
be
ill

<EOS>
the
man
be
bewitch
:
 
he
desire
to
see
me
,
and
I
will
maul
him
,
but
he
will
not
value
it
a
rush
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
half
weary
of
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
burst
out
into
these
thought
,
and
will
certainly
steal
away
as
soon
as
I
decently
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
many
friend
,
and
many
enemy
;
and
the
last
be
more
constant
in
their
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
shuddering
at
all
to
think
of
retire
to
my
old
circumstance
,
if
you
can
be
easy
;
but
I
will
always
live
in
Ireland
as
I
do
the
last
time
;
I
will
not
hunt
for
dinner
there
,

<EOS>
Mr.
Tooke

at
Morphew
be
the
bookseller

<EOS>
I

,
it

Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
woman
's
hand
,
and
seem
false
spelt
on
purpose
:
 
it
be
in
such
sort
of
verse
as
Harris
's
petition
;
rally
me
for
write
merry
thing
,
and
not
upon
divinity
;
and
be
like
the
subject
of
the
Archbishop
's
last
letter
,
as
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
guess
whom
it
come
from
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
ill
write
;
pray
find
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
latin
verse
at
the
end
of
<EOS>
it
all
rightly
spelt
;
yet
the
English
,
as
I
think
,
affectedly
wrong
in
many
place

I

I

I
would
,
and
put

wherein
a

<EOS>
if

for
it
be

bring
good

else
they
would
break

be

PMD

<EOS>
Cross
wind
may
sometimes
make

but
PMD

can
not
miscarry
.
  
<EOS>
terrible

<EOS>
Lord

<EOS>
I
hate
to
have
him
ill
,
he
be
so
confoundedly
careless
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
your

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
he
be
eat
some
broth
in
his
bed
-
chamber
,
undress
,
with
a
thousand
paper
about
him

<EOS>
He
have
a
little
fever
upon
him
,
and
his
eye
terribly
bloodshot
;
yet
he
dress
himself
and
go
out
to
the
Treasury
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
have
a
letter
from
a
lady
with
a
complaint
against
me
;
it
be
from
Mrs.
Cutts
,
a
sister
of
Lord
Cutts
,
who
writ
to
him
that
I
have
abuse
her
brother
:
 
<EOS>
you
remember
the
"
Salamander
,
"
it
be
print
in
the
Miscellany
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
my
lord
that
I
would
never
regard
complaint
,
and
that
I
expect
,
whenever
he
receive
any
against
me
,
he
would
immediately
put
them
into
the
fire
,
and
forget
them
,
else
I
should
have
no
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
turn
in
my
head
this
morning
;
which
,
though
it
do
not
last
above
a
moment
,
yet
be
of
the
true
sort
,
have
make
me
as
weak
as
a

all
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
the
first
I
have
have
this

<EOS>
I

Lady
Mountjoy
's

Harry
Coote

and
go

see
Lord
Pembroke
upon
his

<EOS>
the
Whig
party
be
furious
against
a
peace
,
and
every
day
some
ballad
come
out
reflect
on
the
Ministry
on
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
St.
John
have
seize
on
a
dozen
bookseller
and
publisher
into
his
messenger
'
hand
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
foreign
Ministers
have
publish
the
preliminary
agree
on
here
between
France
and
England
;
and
people
rail
at
them
as
insufficient
to
treat
a
peace
upon
;
but
the
secret
be
,
that
the
French
have
agree
to
article
much
more
important
,
which
our
Ministers
have
not
communicate
,
and
the
people
,
who
think
they
know
all
,
be
discontent
that
there
be
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
an
inconvenience
I
foretell
to
the
Secretary
,
but
we
could
contrive
no
way
to
fence
against
it
.
<EOS>
so
there
be
politic
for
you

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
this

do
not

the
Dean

<EOS>
26

<EOS>
I

Mrs.
Van

for
the
weather
be
so
bad
,
and
I
be
so
busy
,
that
I
can
not
dine

folk
:
 
and
besides
I
dare
eat

which
be
well

<EOS>
Lord

Whigs
,
they
be
so
violent
against
a
peace
;
but
I
will
cool
them
,
with
a
vengeance
,
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
hear
from
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
,
whether
he
have
get
his
statue
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
him
six
week
ago
;
he
be
so
busy
with
his
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
your
letter
yet
,
say
what
you
will
,
saucy
girl
.
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
go
about
some
business
this
morning
,
which
cost
me
double
the
time
;
and
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
be
at
the
Secretary
's
office
till
four
,
and
lose
my
dinner
;
so
I
go
to
Mrs.
Van
's
,
and
make
them
get
me
three
herring
,
which
I
be
very
fond
of
,
and
they
be
a
light
victual
:
 
besides
<EOS>
,
I
be
to
have
sup
at
Lady
Ashburnham
's
;
but
the
drab
do
not
call
for
us
in
her
coach
,
as
she
promise
,
but
send
for
us
,
and
so
I
send
my
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
terrible
rainy
day
,
but
so
flattering
in
the
morning
,
that
I
would
needs
go
out
in
my
new
hat
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
Leigh
and
Sterne
as
I
be
go
into
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
Leigh
say
he
will
go
to
Ireland
in
ten
day
,
if
he
can
get
Sterne
to
go
with
him
;
so
I
will
send
him
the
thing
for
MD
,
and
I
have
desire
him
to
inquire
about
the
box
.
<EOS>
I
hate
that
Sterne
for
his
carelessness
about
it
;
but
it
be
my
fault
.
  
<EOS>
29
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
all
this
terrible
rainy
day
with
my
friend
Lewis
upon
business
of
importance
;
and
I
dine
with
him
,
and
come
home
about
seven
,
and
think
I
would
amuse
myself
a
little
,
after
the
pain
I
have
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
a
volume
of
Congreve
's
play
in
my
room
,
that
Patrick
have
take
to
read
;
and
I
look
into
it
,
and
in
mere
loitering
read
in
it
till
twelve
,
like
an
owl
and
a
fool
:
 
if
ever
<EOS>
I
do
so
again
;
never
see
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
Count
Gallas
,
the
Emperor
's
Envoy
,
you
will
hear
,
be
in
disgrace
with
us
:
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
have
order
her
Ministers
to
have
no
more
commerce
with
him
;
the
reason
be
,
the
fool
writ
a
rude
letter
to
Lord
Dartmouth
,
Secretary
of
State
,
complain
of
our
proceeding
about
a
peace
;
and
he
be
always
in
close
confidence
with
Lord
Wharton
and
Sunderland
,
and
other
of
the
late
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
begin
to
think
there
will
be
no
peace
;
the
Whigs
here
be
sure
it
can
not
be
,
and
stock
be
fall
again
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
confident
there
will
,
unless
France
play
us
trick
;
and
you
may
venture
a
wager
with
any
of
your
Whig
acquaintance
that
we
shall
not
have
another
campaign
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
get
more
by
it
than
by
ombre
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
I
let
slip
tell
you
yesterday
's
journal
,
which
I
think
to
have
do
this
morning
,
but
blunder
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
yesterday
at
Harry
Coote
's
,
with
Lord
Hatton
,
Mr.
Finch
,
a
son
of
Lord
Nottingham
,
and
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
them
soon
,
but
hear
they
stay
till
two
in
the
morning
,
and
be
all
drunk
:
 
and
so
good
-
night
for
last
night
,
and
good
-
night
for
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
blunder
goosecap
,
an't
<EOS>
you
ashamed
to
blunder
to
young
lady
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
a
fire
in
three
or
four
day
now
,
<EOS>
oh
ho
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
day
in
the
City
concert
some
thing
with
a
printer
,
and
be
to
be
to
-
morrow
all
day
busy
with
Mr.
Secretary
about
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
tell
you
now
;
but
the
Ministers
reckon
it
will
do
abundance
of
good
,
and
open
the
eye
of
the
nation
,
who
be
half
bewitch
against
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
few
of
this
generation
can
remember
anything
but
war
and
taxis
,
and
they
think
it
be
as
it
should
be
;
whereas
'
<EOS>
tis
certain
we
be
the
most
undone
people
in
Europe
,
as
I
be
afraid
I
shall
make
<EOS>
appear
beyond
all
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
forgot
;
I
will
not
tell
you
what
I
will
do
,
nor
what
I
will
not
do
:
 
<EOS>
so
let
me
alone
,
and
go
to
Stoyte
,
and
give
Goody
Stoyte
and
catherine
my
humble
service
<EOS>
;
I
love
goody
stoyte
better
than
Goody
Walls
.
 
<EOS>
who
will
pay
me
for
this
green
apron
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
the
money
;
it
cost
ten
shilling
and
sixpence
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
plaguy
dear
for
a
cheap
thing
;
but
they
say
that
english
silk
would
cockle
,
and
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
You
have
the
making
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
right
Italian
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
send
it
and
the
pamphlet
to
Leigh
,
and
will
send
the
Miscellanies
and
spectacle
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
send
more
;
but
,
faith
,
I
be
plaguy
poor
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
31
.
 
<EOS>
the
devil
be
in
this
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
this
morning
he
have
people
with
him
;
but
say
he
,
"
we
be
to
dine
with
prior
to
-
day
,
and
then
will
do
all
our
business
in
the
afternoon
"
:
 
at
two
,
prior
send
word
he
be
otherwise
engage
;
then
the
Secretary
and
I
go
and
dine
with
Brigadier
Britton
,
sit
till
eight
,
grow
merry
,
no
business
do
;
he
be
in
haste
to
see
Lady
Jersey
;
we
part
,
and
appoint
no
time
to
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
fault
of
all
the
present
Ministers
,
tease
me
to
death
for
my
assistance
,
lay
the
whole
weight
of
their
affair
upon
it
,
yet
slip
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
mend
every
day
,
though
slowly
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
take
care
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
will
you
send
to
Parvisol
to
send
me
a
bill
of
twenty
pound
as
soon
as
he
can
,
for
I
want
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
money
;
I
will
have
money
,
sirrah
.
  
<EOS>
November
1
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
-
day
into
the
City
to
settle
some
business
with
Stratford
,
and
to
dine
with
him
;
but
he
be
engage
,
and
I
be
so
angry
I
would
not
dine
with
any
other
merchant
,
but
go
to
my
printer
,
and
eat
a
bit
,
and
do
business
of
mischief
with
him
,
and
I
shall
have
the
spectacle
and
Miscellany
to
-
morrow
,
and
leave
them
with
Leigh
.
 
<EOS>
a
fine
day
always
make
me
go
into
the
City
,
if
I
can
spare
time
,
because
it
be
exercise
;
and
that
do
me
more
good
than
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
nothing
since
of
my
head
,
but
a
little
,
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
how
,
sometimes
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
very
temperate
,
especially
now
the
Treasurer
be
ill
,
and
the
Ministers
often
at
Hampton
Court
,
and
the
Secretary
not
yet
fix
in
his
house
,
and
I
hate
dine
with
many
of
my
old
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
here
have
be
a
fellow
discover
go
out
of
the
East
India
House
with
sixteen
thousand
pound
in
money
and
bill
;
he
would
have
escape
,
if
he
have
not
be
so
uneasy
with
thirst
,
that
he
steal
out
before
his
time
,
and
be
catch
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
that
to
MD
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
we
have
the
money
,
provide
the
East
India
Company
be
never
the
bad
;
you
know
we
must
not
covet
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Our
weather
,
for
this
fortnight
past
,
be
chequer
,
a
fair
and
a
rainy
day
:
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
fine
,
and
I
have
walk
four
mile
;
wish
MD
would
do
so
,
lazy
sluttikin
.
  
<EOS>
2
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
rain
all
day
with
a
continuendo
,
and
I
go
in
a
chair
to
dine
with
Mrs.
Van
;
always
there
in
a
very
rainy
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
make
a
shift
to
come
back
afoot
.
 
<EOS>
I
live
a
very
retired
life
,
pay
very
few
visit
,
and
keep
but
very
little
company
;
I
read
no
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
send
you
the
Examiner
,
<EOS>
for
the
printer
be
go
to
print
them
in
a
small
volume
:
 
<EOS>
it
seem
the
author
be
too
proud
to
have
them
print
by
subscription
,
though
his
friend
offer
,
they
say
,
to
make
it
worth
five
hundred
pound
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
Spectators
be
likewise
print
in
a
large
and
a
small
volume
,
so
I
believe
they
be
go
to
leave
them
off
,
and
indeed
people
grow
weary
of
them
,
though
they
be
often
prettily
write
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
no
news
for
me
to
send
you
now
towards
the
end
of
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
have
the
gout
a
little
:
I
hope
the
Lord
Treasurer
would
have
have
it
too
,
but
Radcliffe
tell
me
yesterday
it
be
the
rheumatism
in
his
knee
and
foot
;
however
,
he
mend
,
and
I
hope
will
be
abroad
in
a
short
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
they
design
give
away
several
employment
before
the
Parliament
sit
,
which
will
be
the
thirteenth
instant
.
 
<EOS>
I
either
do
not
like
,
or
not
understand
this
policy
;
and
if
Lord
Treasurer
do
not
mend
soon
,
they
must
give
them
just
before
the
session
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
the
great
procrastinator
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
<EOS>
a
fine
day
this
,
<EOS>
and
I
walk
a
pretty
deal
.
 
<EOS>
I
stuff
the
Secretary
's
pocket
with
paper
,
which
he
must
read
and
settle
at
Hampton
Court
,
where
he
go
to
-
day
,
and
stay
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
lodging
for
me
there
,
so
I
can
not
go
,
for
the
town
<EOS>
be
small
,
chargeable
,
and
inconvenient
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
have
a
very
ill
night
last
night
,
with
much
pain
in
his
knee
and
foot
,
but
be
easy
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
go
to
visit
prior
about
some
business
,
and
so
he
be
not
within
,
and
so
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
make
me
dine
to
-
day
again
with
Mrs.
Van
,
and
<EOS>
I
come
home
soon
,
remember
this
must
go
to
-
night
,
and
that
I
have
a
letter
of
MD
's
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
o
Lord
,
where
be
it
?
<EOS>
let
me
see
;
so
,
so
,
here
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
grudge
write
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
on
that
bill
!
<EOS>
the
woman
would
have
me
manage
that
money
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
now
<EOS>
I
have
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
like
the
unprofitable
steward
in
the
Gospel
:
 
<EOS>
I
lay
it
up
in
a
napkin
;
there
thou
hast
what
be
thine
own
,
<EOS>
etc
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
I
know
of
your
new
Mayor
.
<EOS>
(
I
will
tell
you
a
pun
:
 
a
fishmonger
owe
a
man
two
crown
;
so
he
send
him
a
piece
of
bad
ling
and
a
tench
,
and
then
say
he
be
pay
:
 
<EOS>
how
be
that
now
?
<EOS>
find
it
out
;
for
I
will
not
tell
it
you
:
 
<EOS>
which
of
you
find
it
out
?
)
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
as
I
be
say
,
what
care
I
for
your
Mayor
?
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
Ford
may
tell
Forbes
right
about
my
returning
to
Ireland
before
Christmas
,
or
soon
after
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
you
do
not
go
on
with
your
story
about
pray
God
<EOS>
you
be
John
;
I
never
hear
it
in
my
life
,
and
wonder
what
it
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
Stella
,
faith
,
you
lean
upon
your
Bible
to
think
what
to
say
when
you
writ
that
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
that
story
of
the
Secretary
's
make
me
an
example
be
true
;
"
never
hear
it
before
;
"
why
,
how
could
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
be
it
possible
to
tell
you
the
hundredth
part
of
what
pass
in
our
company
here
?
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
be
as
easy
with
me
as
Mr.
Addison
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
think
what
a
splutter
Sir
William
Temple
make
about
be
Secretary
of
State
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
Mr.
St.
John
the
great
young
man
I
ever
know
;
wit
,
capacity
,
beauty
,
quickness
of
apprehension
,
good
learning
,
and
an
excellent
taste
;
the
good
orator
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
admirable
conversation
,
good
nature
,
and
good
manner
;
<EOS>
generous
,
and
a
despiser
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
His
only
fault
be
talk
to
his
friend
in
way
of
complaint
of
too
great
a
load
of
business
,
which
look
a
little
like
affectation
;
and
he
endeavour
too
much
to
mix
the
fine
gentleman
and
man
of
pleasure
with
the
man
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
what
truth
and
sincerity
he
may
have
I
know
not
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
now
but
thirty
-
two
,
and
have
be
Secretary
above
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
all
this
extraordinary
?
<EOS>
how
he
stand
with
the
Queen
and
Lord
Treasurer
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
before
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
his
character
;
and
I
believe
you
will
be
divert
by
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
writ
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
Bishop
of
Cloyne
and
of
Clogher
together
,
five
week
ago
from
Windsor
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
they
have
my
letter
;
pray
know
if
Clogher
have
his
.
 
<EOS>
Fig
for
your
physician
and
his
advice
,
Madam
Dingley
:
 
<EOS>
if
I
grow
bad
,
I
will
;
otherwise
I
will
trust
to
temperance
and
exercise
:
 
your
fall
of
the
leaf
;
what
care
I
when
the
leave
fall
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
see
them
fall
with
all
my
heart
;
but
why
should
I
take
physic
because
leave
fall
off
from
tree
?
<EOS>
that
will

otherwise
I

rather
than

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I
ask

and
she
say
she

because
she
design

there
be
no

in

;
which
I
will
do
on
Wednesday
,
when
they
come
from

<EOS>
the

be
very
handsome
,
and
it
be
a
very
great
mark
of
honour
and
distinction
to
Lord
Pembroke
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
two
french
Ministers
be
come
over
again
about
the
peace
;
but
I
have
see
nobody
of
consequence
to
know
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
be
sick
,
in
her
bed

<EOS>
'
Twas
a

we
have
procession

<EOS>
You

this
be
the
Fifth

November
,
Popery
and
gunpowd
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
since
I
be
use
to
this
way
of
writing
,
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
make
out
a
long
letter
to
MD
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
to
allow
for
every
line
take
up
by
tell
you
where
I
dine
;
but
that
will
not
be
above
seven
line
in
all
,
half
a
line
to
a
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Ingoldsby
be
go
over
,
and
they
say
here
he
be
to
be
make
a
lord
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
I
stay
in
my

this

for
that
puppy
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
who
be
to
go
with
me
into
the
City
,
and
never
come
;
and
if
I
have
not
shoot
a
dinner
fly
,
with
one
Mr.
Murray
,
I
may
have
fast
,
or
go
to
an
alehouse
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
say
one
word
of
Goody
Stoyte
in
your
letter
;
but
I
suppose
these
winter
night
we
shall
hear
more
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
do
the
Provost
laugh
as
much
as
he
use
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
We
reckon
him
here
a
good
-
for
-
nothing
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
design
to
write
to
your
Dean
one
of
these
day
,
but
I
can
never
find
time
,
nor
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
something
:
 
<EOS>
but
if
DD
be
not
in
Ireland
I
believe
seriously
I
should
not
think
of
the
place
twice
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
there
ever
make
the
subject
of
talk
in
any
company
where
I
be

but
stop
at
a
printer
's
,
and
stay
there
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
most
delicious
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
Parliament
be
to
be
prorogue
for
a
fortnight
longer
;
I
suppose
,
either
because
the
Queen
have
the
gout
,
or
that
Lord
Treasurer
be
not
well
,
or
that
they
would
do
something
more
towards
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
at
noon
,
and
sit
a
while
with
Lord
Harley
,
but

I

<EOS>
I
be
glad
of

;
the

be
as
great

<EOS>
but

<EOS>
I

the

prior

I
believe

be
one
of
those

when
a
Congress

<EOS>
Lord
Ashburnham
tell
to

house
that
Lord

the

,
and
he
dine
in
the
City
with
prior

so
it

but
I
hope

be
so
;
for
I
know
it
have
be
privately
manage
this
long
time
:
the

will
not

the

Duchess

and
she
be
now
at
law
with
Pelham
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
at
bad
,
the
girl
will
have
about
ten
thousand
pound
a
year
to
support
the
honour
;
for
Lord
Treasurer
will
never
save
a
groat
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Harley
be
a
very
valuable
young
gentleman
;
and
they
say
the

and
have
good

put
off
the
Parliament
a
fortnight
longer
.
 
<EOS>
My

have
have
no
ill

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
good
walk
to
-
day
in
the
city
,
and
take
all
opportunity
of
it
on
purpose
for
my
health
;
but
I
can
not
walk
in
the
Park
,
because
that
be
only
for
walk
's
sake
,
and
lose
time
,
so
I
mix
it
with
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
walk
half
as
much
as
Presto
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
with
you
,
I
would
make
you
walk
;
I
would
walk
behind
or
before
you
,
and
you
should
have
mask
on
,
and
be
tuck
up
like
anything
;
and
Stella
be
naturally
a
stout
walker
,
and
carry
herself
firm
;
methinks
I
see
her
strut
,
and
step
clever
over
a
kennel
;
and
Dingley
would
do
well
enough
if
her
petticoat
be
pin
up
;
but
she
be
so
embroiled
,
and
so
fearful
,
<EOS>
and
then
Stella
scold
,
and
Dingley
stumble
,
and
be
so
daggle
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
get
the
whalebone
petticoat
among
you
yet
?
 
<EOS>
I
hate
them
;
a
woman
here
may
hide
a
moderate
gallant
under
them
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
,
what
be
all
this
<EOS>
I

at
Pepperhara
,
and
be
skulk
about
the
town
nobody
know
where

<EOS>
and
who
do
you
think
manage
all
this
for
him
,
but
that
rogue
Child
,
the
double
squire
of
Farnham
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
Mrs.

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
I
be
weary
of

,
and
want
my

to
Laracor
;
they
do

more
good
than
all
the
Ministries

twenty
year
.
 
<EOS>
I

day
in

<EOS>
Lady

dilly
be
get
to
Ireland
,
and
that
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin

the
cause
of
his
return
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
be
prorogue
two
day
ago
for
a
fortnight
,
which
,
with
the
Queen
's
absence
,
make
the
town
very
dull
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
the
Duke
of
Ormond
bring
all
the
world
away
with
him
from
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
London
have
nothing
so
bad
in
it
in
winter
as
your
knot
of
irish
folk
;
but
I
go
to
no
coffee
-
house
,
and
so
I
seldom
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
letter
shall
go
on
Saturday
;
and
then
I
be
even
with
the
world
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lend
money
,
and
can
not
get
it
,
and
be
force
to
borrow
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
My
man
make
a
blunder
this
morning
,
and
let
up
a
visitor
,
when
I
have
order
to
see
nobody
;
so
I
be
force
to
hurry
a
hang
-
dog
instrument
of
mine
into
my
bed
-
chamber
,
and
keep
him
cool
his
heel
there
above
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
on
fairly
in
the
common
form
of
a
great
cold
;
I
believe
it
will
last
me
about
ten
day
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
tell
you
,
that
in
those
two
verse
send
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
G####d
stand
for
Guiscard
;
that
be
easy
;
but
we
differ
about
F####n
;
I
think
it
be
for
Frenchman
,
because
he
hate
them
,
and
they
him
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
would
be
,
<EOS>
that
although
Guiscard
's
knife
miss
its
design
,
the
knife
of
a
Frenchman
may
yet
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
think
it
stand
for
Felton
,
the
name
of
him
that
stab
the
first
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
and
I
dine
with
the
Vans
to

day
,
and
my
cold
make
me
loiter
all
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
young
woman
,
do
not
you
begin
to
owe
me
a
letter
?
<EOS>
just
a
month
to
-
day
since
I
have
your
n.22
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
stay
a
week
longer
,
and
then
,
I
will
expect
like
agog
;
till
then
you
may
play
at
ombre
,
and
so
forth
,
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
be
still
cry
down
our
peace
,
but
we
will
have
it
,
I
hope
,
in
spite
of
them
:
 
<EOS>
the
Emperor
come
now
with
his
two
egg
a
penny
,
and
promise
wonder
to
continue
the
war
;
but
it
be
too
late
;
only
I
hope
the
fear
of
it
will
serve
to
spur
on
the
French
to
be
easy
and
sincere
:
  
night
,
sirrah
;
I
will
go
early
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
Morning
.
 
<EOS>
this
go
to
-
night
;
I
will
put
it
myself
in
the
post
-
office
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
now
a
long
letter
from
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
give
me
an
account
of
the
end
your
session
<EOS>
,
how
it
end
in
a
storm
;
which
storm
,
by
the
time
it
arrive
here
,
will
be
only
half
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
,
I
will
not
hide
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
advise
the
dissolution
of
that
Parliament
,
although
I
do
not
think
the
scoundrel
have
so
much
courage
;
but
they
have
it
only
in
the
wrong
,
like
a
bully
that
will
fight
for
a
whore
,
and
run
away
in
an
army
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
by
several
thing
the
Archbishop
say
,
he
be
not
very
well
either
with
the
Government
or
clergy
.
 
<EOS>
see
how
luckily
my
paper
end
with
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
bless
and
preserve
dearest
little
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
your
Lord
Lieutenant
be
now
set
out
for
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
do
not
write
to
me
,
or
let
me
know
of
his
statue
,
and
how
he
like
them
:
 
I
will
write
to
him
again
,
as
soon
as
I
have
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
dear
MD
,
and
love
Presto

who
love
MD
infinitely
above
all
earthly
thing

and

dress
up
the
Pope
,
Devil
,
cardinal

Sacheverell
,
etc
.
,
and
carry
them
with
torch
about

<EOS>
They

I
mean

if
ever
you
hear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
seize
last
night
,
by
order
from
the
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
you
will
have
an
account
of
it
,
for
they
bawl
it
about
the
street
already
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
some
very
foolish
and
mischievous
design
;
and
it
be
think
they
would
have
put
the
rabble
upon
assault
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
house
and
the
Secretary
's
,
and
other
violence
.
<EOS>
the
militia
be
raise
to
prevent
it
,
and
now
,
I
suppose
,
all
will
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
the
figure
be
now
at
the
Secretary
's
office
at
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
I

from
Hampton
Court
.
<EOS>
He
be
tell
me
more
particular
about
this
business
of
burn
the
Pope
.
<EOS>
It
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
,
and
have
it
go
on
,
would
have
cost
three
time
as
much
;
but
the
town
be
full
of
it
,
and
half
a
dozen
Grub
Street
paper
already
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
and
I
dine
at
Brigadier
Britton
's

but
I
leave
them
at
six
,
upon
an
appointment
with
some
sober
company
of
man
and
lady
,
to
drink
punch
at
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
's
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
not
very
merry
;
and
I
do
not
love
rack
punch
<EOS>
,
I
love
it
better
with
brandy
;
be

of
my
opinion
?
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
twelvepenny
weather
;
sirrah
,
why
do
not
you
play

shuttlecock
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
it
a
hundred
time
;
faith
,
Presto

and

before
the
cold

<EOS>
do

<EOS>
I
never
do

they
never
come
in
my
way
;
I
go
to
no
coffee

house
.
<EOS>
They
say
abundance
of
them

very
pretty
;
they
be
go

be
print
in
small
volume
;
I
will
bring
them

<EOS>
I

,
and
if
Leigh

I
will
send

<EOS>
I
do
not
know

I
have
not
see
him

good
<EOS>
while
,
though
he
promise

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

at
Lord
Dartmouth
's
office
,
and
send
out
for

<EOS>
I

ask
him
more
concern
this
bustle
about
the
figure
in
wax
-
work
of
the
Pope
,
and
Devil
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
leisure
,
or
he
would
have
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
owner
be
so
impudent
,
that
they
design
to
replevin
them
by
law
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
assure
that
the
figure
of
the
Devil
be
make
as
like
Lord
Treasurer
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
Lord

Mr.
Secretary

when
I
be
there
,
not

the
Duke
of
Marlborough

the

<EOS>

so
tease
with
whiggish
discourse
by
Mrs.
Barton
and
Lady
Betty
Germaine

never

.
 
<EOS>
They
turn
all
this
affair
of
the
Pope
-
burn
into
ridicule
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
have
make
too
great
a
clutter
about
it
,
if
they
have
no
real
reason
to
apprehend
some
tumult
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lady
Betty
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
Prior
's
commission
be
pass
to
be
Ambassador
Extraordinary

<EOS>
but

<EOS>
Lord

and
how

mean
birth
on
an

and

<EOS>
I

and
think

but

that
whenever

I
expect
to
find
some

and
never

worth
a
farthing
,
but
often
to
vex

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
You
will
think
it
affectation
;
but
nothing

more
for

ill
of

I

which
I
have
never

and
the

I
have
only

<EOS>
a

till

this
evening
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
perfectly
as
fine
<EOS>
a
gentleman
as
I
know
<EOS>
;
he
set
me
down
at
Lord
Treasurer
's
,
with
whom
I
stay
about
an
hour
,
till
Monsieur
Buys
,
the
Dutch
Envoy
,
come
to
him
about
business
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
Treasurer
be
pretty
well
,
but
stiff
in
the
hip
with
the
remain
of
the
rheumatism
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
bring
Domville
to
my
Lord
Harley
in
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
dirty
rainy
day
that
ever
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
pamphlet
be
publish
;
Lord
Treasurer
have
it
by
him
on
the
table
,
and
be
ask
me
about
the
motto
in
the
title
-
page
;
he
give
me
one
of
them
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
send
you
the
pamphlet
,
if
I
can
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Van
send
to
me
to
dine
with
her
to
-
day
,
because
some
lady
of
my
acquaintance
be
to
be
there
;
and
there
I
dine
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
to
return
Domville
his
visit
,
and
go
to
visit
Mrs.
Masham
,
who
be
not
within
.
<EOS>
I
be
turn
out
of
my
lodging
by
my
landlady
:
 
it
seem
her
husband
and
her
son
be
come
home
;
but
I
have
take
another
lodging
hard
by
,
in
Leicester
Fields
.
 
<EOS>
I
present
Mr.
Domville
to
Mr.
Lewis
and
Mr.
Prior
this
morning
.
<EOS>
prior
<EOS>
and
I
be
call
the
two
Sosias
,
in
a
Whig
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
Sosias
,
can
you
read
it
?
 
<EOS>
the
pamphlet
begin
to
make
a
noise
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
ask
by
several
whether
I
have
see
it
,
and
they
advise
me
to
read
it
,
for
it
be
something
very
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
suspect
;
and
it
will
have
several
paltry
answer
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
take
its
fate
,
as
Savage
say
of
his
sermon
that
he
preach
at
Farnham
on
Sir
William
Temple
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
Domville
see
Savage
in
Italy
,
and
say
he
be
a
coxcomb
,
and
half
mad
:
 
he
go
in
red
,
and
with
yellow
waistcoat
,
and
be
at
ceremony
kneel
to
the
Pope
on
a
Palm
Sunday
,
which
be
much
more
than
kiss
his
toe
;
and
I
believe
it
will
ruin
him
here
when
'
tis
tell
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
your
letter
in
my
new
lodging
:
 
<EOS>

hardly
room

<EOS>
this

and

afternoon
with
the

,
add
something
to
the
second

<EOS>
I
dine
with
the
printer
:
the
pamphlet
make
a
world
of
noise
,
and
will
do
a
great
deal
of
good
;
it
tell
abundance
of
most
important
fact
which
be
not
at
all

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
You

<EOS>

that

and
the

<EOS>
He

his
glass
out
at
the
Queen
and
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
right
what
dilly
say
:
 
I
depend
upon
nothing
from
my
friend
,
but
to
go
back
as
I
come
.
 
<EOS>
never
fear
Laracor
,
'
twill
mend
with
a
peace
,
or
surely
they
will
give
me
the
Dublin
parish
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
be
in
the
right
:
 
the
Bishop
of
Ossory
be
the
silly
,
best
-
natured
wretch
breathing
,
of
as
little
consequence
as
an
egg
-
shell
.
<EOS>
well
,
the
spelling
I
have
mention
before
;
only
the
next
time
say
at
LEAST
,
and
not
at
LEST
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
on
your
Newbury

<EOS>
what
can
I
do
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
his

(
I
be
glad
it

not
a

I
can

<EOS>
Pray
<EOS>
God
preserve
poor
good

great
loss
to
us
all
:
 
pray
give
her
my
service
,
and
tell
her
she
have
my
heartiest
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
I
pity
poor
Mrs.
Manley
;
but
I
think
the
child
be
happy
to
die
,
consider
how
little
provision
it
would
have
have
.
 
<EOS>
Poh
,
every

abuse
me
,
and
for
thing
that
I
never
writ
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
should
have
write

thank
for
his
two
hundred
pound

<EOS>
I
reckon
he
get
it
by
my
mean
;
and
I
must
thank
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
who
I
dare
swear
<EOS>
will
say
he

it
on
my

<EOS>
Hawkshaw

eight
pound
be
not
reckon
and
if
it
be
secure
,
it
may
lie
where
it
be
,
unless
they
desire
to
pay
it
:
 
<EOS>
so
Parvisol
may
let
it
drop
till
further
order
;
for
I
have
put
Mrs.
Wesley
's
money
into
the
Bank

and
will
pay

Hawkshaw
's

<EOS>
Pish
,
sirrah
,
put
a
date
always
at
the
bottom
of
your
letter
,
as
well
as
the
top
,
that
I
may
know
when
you
send
it
;
your
last
be
of
November
3
,
yet
I
have
other
at
the
same
time
,
write
a
fortnight
after
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
you
would
have
any
money
,
send
me
word
three
week
before
,
and
in
that
time
you
will
certainly
have
an
answer
,
with
a
bill
on
Parvisol
:
 
<EOS>
pray
do
this
;
for
my
head
be
full
,
and
it
will
ease
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
think
I
quote
to
you
some
of
#
#
#
#
"
s
letter
,
so
you
may
imagine
how
witty
the
rest
be
;
for
it
be
all
of
a
bunch
,
as
Goodman
Peesley
say
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
have
no
more
bussiness
,
but
busyness
:
 
<EOS>
the
deuce
take
me
if
I
know
how
to
spell
it
;
your
wrong
spelling
,
Madam
Stella
,
have
put
me
out
:
 
<EOS>
it
do
not
look
right
;
let
me
see
,
bussiness
,
busyness
,
business
,
bisyness
,
bisness
,
bysness
;
faith
,
I
know
not
which
be
right
<EOS>
,
I
think
the
second
;
I
believe
I
never
writ
the
word
in
my
life
before
;
yes
,
sure
I
must
,
though
;
business
,
busyness
,
bisyness
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
perplex
myself
,
and
can
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Prithee
ask
wall
.
 
<EOS>
business
,
I
fancy
that
be
right
.
<EOS>
yes
it
be
;
I
look
in
my
own
pamphlet
,
and
find
it
twice
in
ten
line
,
to
convince
you
that
I
never
writ
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
now
I
see
it
as
plain
as
can
be
;
so
yours
be
only
an
s
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
will
certainly
meet
on
Friday
next
:
 
the
Whigs
will
have
a
great
majority
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
no
care
be
take
to
prevent
it
;
there
be
too
much
neglect
;
they
be
warn
of
it
,
and
that
signify
nothing
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
fear
there
would
be
some
peevish
address
from
the
Lords
against
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
say
about
the
town
that
several
of
the
Allies
begin
now
to
be
content
that
a
peace
should
be
treat
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
the
news
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
be
pretty
well
:
 
and
so
now
I
bid
poor
dearest
MD
farewell
till
to
-
night
;
then
I
will
talk
with
them
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
fifteen
image
that
I
see
be
not
worth
forty
pound
,
so
I
stretch
a
little
when
I
say
a
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
the
Grub
Street
account
of
that
tumult
be
publish
.
 
<EOS>
the
Devil
be
not
like
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
they
be
all
in
your
odd
antic
mask
,
buy
in
common
shop
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
prior
will
not
be
one
of
the
plenipotentiary
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
look
over
this
letter
,
and
find
I
make
many
mistake
of
leave
out
word
<EOS>
;
so
'
tis
impossible
to
find
my
meaning
,
unless
you
be
conjurer
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
more
care
for
the
future
,
and
read
over
every
day
just
what
I
have
write
that
day
,
which
will
take
up
no
time
to
speak
of

<EOS>
Masham

I

the

his

<EOS>
It

not
to
let
any
odd
fellow
come
up
to
me
;
and
a
fellow
would
needs
speak
with
me
from
Sir
George
Pretyman
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
of
him
,
and
would
not
see
the
messenger
:
 
but
at
last
it
prove
that
this
Sir
George
have
sell
his
estate
,
and
be
a
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
Smithers
,
the
Farnham
carrier
,
bring
me
this
morning
a
letter
from
your
mother
,
with
three
paper
enclose
of
Lady
Giffard
's
writing
;
one
own
some
exchequer
business
of
100
pound
to
be
Stella
's
;
another
for
100
pound
that
she
have
of
yours
,
which
I
make
over
to
you
for
Mariston
;
and
a
third
for
300
pound
;
the
last
be
on
stamped
paper
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
have
well
lie
in
England
in
some
good
hand
till
Lady
Giffard
die
;
and
I
will
think
of
some
such
hand
before
I
come
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ask
Smithers
about
all
the
people
of
Farnham
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
White
have
leave
off
dressing
,
be
trouble
with
lameness
and
swell
leg
,
and
seldom
stir
out
;
but
her
old
hang
-
dog
husband
as
hearty
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
about
something
he
would
have
alter
in
the
pamphlet
;
but
it
can
not
be
till
the
fourth
edition
,
which
I
believe
will
be
soon
;
for
I
dine
with
the
printer
,
and
he
tell
me
they
have
sell
off
half
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Perceval
and
her
daughter
have
be
in
town
these
three
week
,
which
I
never
hear
till
to
-
day
;
and
Mrs.
Wesley
be
come
to
town
too
,
to
consult
Dr.
Radcliffe
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
be
resolve
to
bring
that
pamphlet
into
the
House
of
Lords
to
have
it
condemn
,
so
I
hear
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
printer
will
stand
to
it
,
and
not
own
the
author
;
he
must
say
he
have
it
from
the
penny
-
post
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
talk
as
if
the
House
of
Lords
would
do
some
peevish
thing
,
for
the
Whigs
be
now
a
great
majority
in
it
;
our
Ministers
be
too
negligent
of
such
thing
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
slip
give
them
warn
;
some
of
them
be
sensible
of
it
;
but
Lord
Treasurer
stand
too
much
upon
his
own
leg
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
his
good
fortune
will
bear
him
out
in
everything
;
but
in
reason
I
should
think
this
Ministry
to
stand
very
unsteady
;
if
they
can
carry
a
peace
,
they
may
hold
;
I
believe
not
else
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
send
to
me
to
-
day
to
dine
with
him
alone
;
but
we
have
two
more
with
us
,
which
hinder
me
do
some
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
young
Harcourt
,
secretary
to
our
Society
,
to
take
a
room
for
our
weekly
meeting
;
and
the
fellow
ask
us
five
guinea
a
week
only
to
have
leave
to
dine
once
a
week
;
be
not
that
pretty
?
<EOS>
so
we
break
off
with
him
,
and
be
to
dine
next
Thursday
at
Harcourt
's
(
he
be
Lord
Keeper
's
son
)
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
sell
off
above
half
the
third
edition
,
and
answer
be
come
out
:
 
<EOS>
the
Dutch
Envoy
refuse
dining
with
Dr.
Davenant
,
because
he
be
suspect
to
write
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
some
alteration
in
every
edition
,
and
it
have
cost
me
more
trouble
,
for
the
time
,
since
the
printing
,
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
send
over
to
Ireland
,
and
I
suppose
you
will
have
it
reprint
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
now
print
the
fourth
edition
,
which
be
reckon
very
extraordinary
,
consider
'
tis
a
dear
twelvepenny
book
,
and
not
buy
up
in
number
by
the
party
to
give
away
,
as
the
Whigs
do
,
but
purely
upon
its
own
strength
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
an
under
spur
-
leather
to
write
an
Examiner
again
,
and
the
Secretary
and
I
will
now
and
then
send
hint
;
but
we
would
have
it
a
little
upon
the
Grub
Street
,
to
be
a
match
for
their
writer
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
at
five
:
 
<EOS>
he
dine
by
himself
after
his
family
,
and
drink
no
claret
yet
,
for
fear
of
his
rheumatism
,
of
which
he
be
almost
well
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
pleasant
,
as
he
be
always
:
 
yet
I
fancy
he
be
a
little
touch
with
the
present
posture
of
affair
.
 
<EOS>
the
Elector
of
Hanover
's
Minister
here
have
give
in
a
violent
memorial
against
the
peace
,
and
cause
it
to
be
print
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whig
lord
be
do
their
utmost
for
a
majority
against
Friday
,
and
design
,
if
they
can
,
to
address
the
Queen
against
the
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Nottingham
,
a
famous
Tory
and
speech
-
maker
,
be
go
over
to
the
Whig
side
:
they
toast
him
daily
,
and
Lord
Wharton
say
,
It
be
Dismal
<EOS>
(
so
they
call
him
from
his
look
)
will
save
England
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
be
hint
as
if
he
wish
a
ballad
be
make
on
him
,
and
I
will
get
up
one
against
to-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
a
scurrilous
print
paper
of
bad
verse
on
himself
,
under
the
name
of
the
English
Catiline
,
and
make
me
read
them
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
birthday
,
which
he
would
not
tell
us
,
but
Lord
Harley
whisper
it
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
make
the
ballad
<EOS>
,
two
degree
above
Grub
Street
:
 
at
noon
I
pay
a
visit
to
Mrs.
Masham
,
and
then
go
to
dine
with
our
Society
.
<EOS>
poor
Lord
Keeper
dine
below
stair
,
I
suppose
,
on
a
bit
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
We
choose
two
member
:
 
<EOS>
we
be
eleven
meet
,
the
great
meeting
we
ever
have
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
next
week
to
introduce
Lord
Orrery
.
 
<EOS>
the
printer
come
before
we
part
,
and
bring
the
ballad
,
which
make
them
laugh
very
heartily
a
dozen
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
print
the
pamphlet
in
small
,
a
fifth
edition
,
to
be
take
off
by
friend
,
and
send
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
a
sixpenny
answer
be
come
out
,
good
for
nothing
,
but
guess
me
,
among
other
,
for
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
be
the
fatal
day
for
the
Parliament
meeting
,
and
we
be
full
of
hope
and
fear
.
 
<EOS>
We
reckon
we
have
a
majority
of
ten
on
our
side
in
the
House
of
Lords
;
yet
I
observe
Mrs.
Masham
<EOS>
a
little
uneasy
:
 
<EOS>
she
assure
me
<EOS>
the
Queen
be
stout
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
have
not
see
the
Queen
for
some
day
past
;
Mrs.
Masham
be
glad
of
it
,
because
she
say
he
tell
a
hundred
lie
to
his
friend
of
what
she
say
to
him
:
 
he
be
one
day
humble
,
and
the
next
day
on
the
high
rope
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
they
say
,
will
be
in
town
to
-
night
by
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
day
the
Parliament
be
to
meet
,
and
the
great
question
to
be
determine
,
I
go
with
Dr.
Freind
to
dine
in
the
City
,
on
purpose
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
and
we
send
our
printer
to
see
what
be
our
fate
;
but
he
give
us
a
most
melancholy
account
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Nottingham
begin
,
and
speak
against
a
peace
,
and
desire
that
in
their
address
they
may
put
in
a
clause
to
advise
the
Queen
not
to
make
a
peace
without
Spain
;
which
be
debate
,
and
carry
by
the
Whigs
by
about
six
voice
:
 
and
this
have
happen
entirely
by
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
neglect
,
who
do
not
take
timely
care
to
make
up
all
his
strength
,
although
every
one
of
us
give
him
caution
enough
.
<EOS>
Nottingham
have
certainly
be
bribe
.
 
<EOS>
the
question
be
yet
only
carry
in
the
Committee
of
the
whole
House
,
and
we
hope
when
it
be
report
to
the
House
to
-
morrow
,
we
shall
have
a
majority
,
by
some
Scotch
lord
come
to
town
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
a
mighty
blow
and
loss
of
reputation
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
may
end
in
his
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
thing
only
as
the
printer
bring
it
,
who
be
at
the
debate
;
but
how
the
Ministry
take
it
,
or
what
their
hope
and
fear
be
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
until
I
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
early
with
the
Secretary
to
-
morrow
,
and
then
I
will
tell
you
more
,
and
shall
write
a
full
account
to
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
to
-
morrow
,
and
to
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
,
if
I
have
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
horribly
down
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
know
how
Lord
Treasurer
bear
this
,
and
what
remedy
he
have
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Ormond
come
this
day
to
town
,
and
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
early
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
,
and
talk
over
this
matter
.
<EOS>
He
hope
that
when
it
be
report
this
day
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
they
would
disagree
with
their
Committee
,
and
so
the
matter
would
go
off
,
only
with
a
little
loss
of
reputation
to
the
Lord
Treasurer
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Mr.
Cockburn
,
and
after
,
a
Scotch
member
come
in
,
and
tell
us
that
the
clause
be
carry
against
the
Court
in
the
House
of
Lords
almost
two
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
immediately
to
Mrs.
Masham
,
and
meet
Dr.
Arbuthnot
(
the
Queen
's
favourite
physician
)
,
we
go
together
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
just
come
from
wait
at
the
Queen
's
dinner
,
and
go
to
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
hear
nothing
of
the
thing
be
go
against
us
.
<EOS>
It
seem
Lord
Treasurer
have
be
so
negligent
that
he
be
with
the
Queen
while
the
question
be
put
in
the
House
:
 
I
immediately
tell
Mrs.
Masham
that
either
she
and
Lord
Treasurer
have
join
with
the
Queen
to
betray
us
,
or
that
they
two
be
betray
by
the
Queen
:
 
<EOS>
she
protest
solemnly
it
be
not
the
former
,
and
I
believe
her
;
but
she
give
me
some
light
to
suspect
the
Queen
be
change
.
 
<EOS>
for
yesterday
,
when
the
Queen
be
go
from
the
House
,
where
she
sit
to
hear
the
debate
,
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
,
Lord
Chamberlain
,
ask
her
whether
he
or
the
Great
Chamberlain
Lindsey
ought
to
lead
her
out
;
she
answer
short
,
"
neither
of
you
,
"
and
give
her
hand
to
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
who
be
loud
than
any
in
the
House
for
the
clause
against
peace
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
me
one
or
two
more
instance
of
this
sort
,
which
convince
me
that
the
Queen
be
false
,
or
at
least
very
much
wavering
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Masham
beg
us
to
stay
,
because
Lord
Treasurer
would
call
,
and
we
be
resolve
to
fall
on
him
about
his
negligence
in
secure
a
majority
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
,
and
appear
in
good
humour
as
usual
,
but
I
think
his
countenance
be
much
cast
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
rally
him
,
and
desire
him
to
give
me
his
staff
,
which
he
do
:
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
if
he
would
secure
it
me
a
week
,
I
would
set
all
right
:
 
<EOS>
he
ask
how
;
I
say
I
would
immediately
turn
Lord
Marlborough
,
his
two
daughter
,
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Somerset
,
and
Lord
Cholmondeley
,
out
of
all
their
employment
;
and
I
believe
he
have
not
a
friend
but
be
of
my
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
ask
how
he
come
not
to
secure
a
majority
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
answer
nothing
but
<EOS>
that
he
could
not
help
it
,
if
people
would
lie
and
forswear
.
 
<EOS>
a
poor
answer
for
a
great
Minister
.
 
<EOS>
there
fall
from
him
a
scripture
expression
,
that
"
the
heart
of
king
be
unsearchable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
it
be
what
I
fear
,
and
be
from
him
the
bad
news
he
could
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
him
to
know
what
he
have
to
trust
to
:
 
<EOS>
he
stick
a
little
;
but
at
last
bid
me
not
fear
,
for
all
would
be
well
yet
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
fain
have
have
him
eat
a
bit
where
he
be
,
but
he
would
go
home
,
it
be
past
six
:
 
<EOS>
he
make
me
go
home
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
we
find
his
brother
and
Mr.
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
his
son
take
a
list
of
all
in
the
House
of
Commons
who
have
place
,
and
yet
vote
against
the
Court
,
in
such
a
manner
as
if
they
should
lose
their
place
:
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
be
not
able
to
compass
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Keeper
come
in
an
hour
,
and
they
be
go
upon
business
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
leave
him
,
and
return
to
Mrs.
Masham
;
but
she
have
company
with
her
,
and
I
would
not
stay
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
long
journal
,
and
of
a
day
that
may
produce
great
alteration
,
and
hazard
the
ruin
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
be
all
in
triumph
;
they
foretold
how
all
this
would
be
,
but
we
think
it
boast
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
they
say
the
Parliament
should
be
dissolve
before
Christmas
,
and
perhaps
it
may
:
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
your
d-
  
d
 
<EOS>
duchess
of
Somerset
's
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
warn
them
of
it
nine
month
ago
,
and
a
hundred
time
since
:
 
the
Secretary
always
dread
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
Lord
Treasurer
I
should
have
the
advantage
of
him
;
for
he
would
lose
his
head
,
and
I
should
only
be
hang
,
and
so
carry
my
body
entire
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
Mr.
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
we
be
both
of
opinion
that
the
Queen
be
false
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
what
I
hear
,
and
he
confirm
it
by
other
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
go
to
my
friend
Lewis
,
who
have
send
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
talk
of
nothing
but
retire
to
his
estate
in
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
reason
to
believe
the
whole
matter
be
settle
between
the
Queen
and
the
Whigs
;
he
hear
that
Lord
Somers
be
to
be
Treasurer
,
and
believe
that
,
sooner
than
turn
out
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
,
she
will
dissolve
the
Parliament
,
and
get
a
whiggish
one
,
which
may
be
do
by
manage
election
.
 
<EOS>
thing
be
now
in
the
crisis
,
and
a
day
or
two
will
determine
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
desire
him
to
engage
Lord
Treasurer
that
as
soon
as
he
find
the
change
be
resolve
on
,
he
will
send
me
abroad
as
Queen
's
Secretary
somewhere
or
other
,
where
I
may
remain
till
the
new
Ministers
recall
me
;
and
then
I
will
be
sick
for
five
or
six
month
,
till
the
storm
have
spend
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
grant
me
this
;
for
I
should
hardly
trust
myself
to
the
mercy
of
my
enemy
while
their
anger
be
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
the
Secretary
,
who
affect
mirth
,
and
seem
to
hope
all
will
yet
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
him
aside
after
dinner
,
tell
him
how
I
have
serve
them
,
and
have
ask
no
reward
,
but
think
I
may
ask
security
;
and
then
desire
the
same
thing
of
him
,
to
send
me
abroad
before
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
He
embrace
me
,
and
swear
he
would
take
the
same
care
of
me
as
himself
,
etc
.
,
but
bid
me
have
courage
,
for
that
in
two
day
my
Lord
Treasurer
's
wisdom
would
appear
great
than
ever
;
that
he
suffer
all
that
have
happen
on
purpose
,
and
have
take
measure
to
turn
it
to
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
God
send
it
"
;
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
believe
a
syllable
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
the
game
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
know
more
soon
,
and
my
letter
will
at
least
be
a
good
history
to
show
you
the
step
of
this
change
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
Lewis
,
who
think
they
will
let
the
Parliament
sit
till
they
have
give
the
money
,
and
then
dissolve
them
in
spring
,
and
break
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
to
Lord
Treasurer
about
what
I
desire
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
desire
him
with
great
earnestness
to
assure
me
that
all
would
be
well
,
and
that
I
should
fear
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
with
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
this
day
the
Commons
go
to
the
Queen
with
their
address
,
and
all
the
Lords
who
be
for
the
peace
go
with
them
,
to
show
their
zeal
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
some
further
conviction
that
the
Queen
be
false
,
and
it
begin
to
be
know
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
between
two
and
three
to
see
Mrs.
Masham
;
while
I
be
there
she
go
to
her
bed
-
chamber
to
try
a
petticoat
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
come
in
to
see
her
,
and
see
me
in
the
outer
room
,
fall
a
rally
me
:
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
"
You
have
better
keep
company
with
me
,
than
with
such
a
fellow
as
Lewis
,
who
have
not
the
soul
of
a
chicken
,
nor
the
heart
of
a
mite
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
go
in
to
Mrs.
Masham
,
and
as
he
come
back
desire
her
leave
to
let
me
go
home
with
him
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
ask
whether
I
be
not
afraid
to
be
see
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
never
value
my
Lord
Treasurer
in
my
life
,
and
therefore
should
have
always
the
same
esteem
for
Mr.
Harley
and
Lord
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
talk
confidently
,
as
if
he
reckon
that
all
this
would
turn
to
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
hinting
that
he
be
not
sure
of
the
Queen
,
and
that
those
scoundrel
,
starve
lord
would
never
have
dare
to
vote
against
the
Court
,
if
Somerset
have
not
assure
them
that
it
would
please
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
that
be
true
,
and
Somerset
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
till
six
;
then
De
Buys
,
the
Dutch
Envoy
,
come
to
him
,
and
I
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
prior
be
with
us
a
while
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
and
all
of
them
cast
down
,
though
they
make
the
good
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
be
come
to
town
;
I
see
him
last
night
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
in
no
fear
,
but
sanguine
,
although
I
have
tell
him
the
state
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
this
change
so
resemble
the
last
,
that
I
wonder
they
do
not
observe
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
send
for
me
yesterday
to
dine
with
him
,
but
I
be
abroad
;
I
hope
he
have
something
to
say
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
morning
,
and
I
write
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
whom
I
have
not
yet

.
 
<EOS>
Morrow
,
sirrah
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to

the
Duke
of

this

:
 
<EOS>
he

me
two
or
three
question
after
his
civil
way
,
and
they
relate
to
Ireland
:
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
tell
him
that
,
from
the
time
I
have
see
him
,
I
never
once
thought
of
irish
affair
.
 
<EOS>
He
whisper
me
that
he
hope
I
have
do
some
good
thing
here
:
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
if
everybody
else
have
do
half
as
much
,
we
should
not
be
as
we
be
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
then
we
go
aside
,
and
talk
over
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
how
all
thing
stand
,
and
advise
him
what
be
to
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
go
and
sit
an
hour
with
the
Duchess
;
then
as
long
with
Lady
Oglethorpe
,
who
be
so
cunne
a
devil
that
I
believe
she
could
yet
find
a
remedy
,
if
they
would
take
her
advice
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
a
friend
at
Court
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
with
the
Secretary
:
 
<EOS>
he
will
needs
pretend
to

:
 
<EOS>
"
Will

believe
it

"
say
he
,
"
if
you
see
these
people
turn
out
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
yes
,
if
I
see
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Somerset

:
 
<EOS>
he
swear
if
they
be
not

he
would
give
up
his

<EOS>
He

some

<EOS>
He

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
December
15
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
in
my
letter
this
evening
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
day
inquire
at
the
Secretary
's
office
of
Mr.
Lewis
how
thing
go
:
 
<EOS>
I
there
meet
prior
,
<EOS>
who
tell
me
he
give
all
for
go
,
etc
.
,
and
be
of
opinion
<EOS>
the
whole
Ministry
would
give
up
their
place
next
week
:
 
<EOS>
Lewis
think
they
will
not
till
spring
,
when
the
session
be
over
;
both
of
them
entirely
despair
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
see
Mrs.
Masham
,
who
invite
me
to
dinner
;
but
I
be
engage
to
Lewis
.
 
<EOS>
at
four
I
go
to
Masham
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
and
whisper
me
that
he
have
it
from
a
very
good
hand
that
all
would
be
well
,
and
I
find
them
both
very
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
the
company
be
go
to
the
opera
,
but
desire
I
would
come
and
sup
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
at
ten
,
and
Lord
Treasurer
be
there
,
and
sit
with
us
till
past
twelve
,
and
be
more
cheerful
than
I
have
see
him
these
ten
day
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Masham
tell
me
he
be
mightily
cast
down
some
day
ago
,
and
he
could
not
indeed
hide
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
be
in
good
hope
that
the
Queen
have
not
betray
us
,
but
only
have
be
frighten
,
and
flatter
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
yet
be
of
his
opinion
,
whether
my
reason
be
well
,
or
that
my
fear
be
great
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
resolve
,
if
they
give
up
,
or
be
turn
out
soon
,
to
retire
for
some
month
,
and
I
have
pitch
upon
the
place
already
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
take
method
for
hear
from
MD
,
and
write
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
would
be
out
of
the
way
upon
the
first
of
the
ferment
;
for
they
lie
all
thing
on
me
,
even
some
I
have
never
read
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
courage
to
-
day
,
and
go
to
Court
with
a
very
cheerful
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
mightily
crowd
;
both
party
come
to
observe
each
other
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
avoid
Lord
Halifax
's
bow
till
he
force
it
on
me
;
but
we
do
not
talk
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
less
than
fourscore
bow
,
of
which
about
twenty
may
be
to
Whigs
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Somerset
be
go
to
Petworth
,
and
,
I
hear
,
the
Duchess
too
,
of
which
I
shall
be
very
glad
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Eugene
,
who
be
expect
here
some
day
ago
,
we
be
now
tell
,
will
not
come
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
design
to
have
meet
him
with
forty
thousand
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
tell
me
some
day
ago
of
his
discourse
with
the
Emperor
's
Resident
,
that
puppy
Hoffman
,
about
Prince
Eugene
be
come
;
by
which
I
find
my
lord
would
hinder
it
,
if
he
could
;
and
we
shall
be
all
glad
if
he
do
not
come
,
and
think
it
a
good
point
gain
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Andrew
Fountaine
,
Ford
,
and
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Mrs.
Van
,
by
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
mistake
the
day
of
the
month
,
and
be
force
to
mend
it
thrice
.
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
with
Mr.
Masham
and
his
lady
,
by
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
be
to
be
there
,
but
come
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
entertain
Buys
,
<EOS>
the
Dutch
Envoy
,
who
speak
English
well
enough
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
plaguily
politic
,
tell
a
thousand
lie
,
of
which
none
pass
upon
any
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
still
in
the
condition
of
suspense
,
and
I
think
have
little
hope
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
be
not
go
to
Petworth
;
only
the
Duke
,
and
that
be
a
poor
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
Queen
certainly
design
to
change
the
Ministry
,
but
perhaps
may
put
it
off
till
the
session
be
over
:
 
and
<EOS>
I
think
they
have
better
give
up
now
,
if
she
will
not
deal
openly
;
and
then
they
need
not
answer
for
the
consequence
of
a
peace
,
when
it
be
in
other
hand
,
and
may
yet
be
break
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
my
Lord
Privy
Seal
set
out
for
Holland
this
week
:
 
<EOS>
so
the
peace
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
18
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
rain
hard
from
morning
till
night
,
and
cost
me
three
shilling
in
coach
-
hire
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
abundance
of
wet
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
,
and
be
with
the
printer
,
who
have
now
a
fifth
edition
of
the
Conduct
,
etc
.
<EOS>
:
it
be
in
small
,
and
sell
for
sixpence
;
they
have
print
as
many
as
three
edition
,
because
they
be
to
be
send
in
number
into
the
country
by
great
man

We

<EOS>
You

it
at
your
distance

without
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
everybody
will
guess
it
to
be
mine
,
because
it
be
somewhat
in
the
same
manner
with
that
of
"
Merlin
"
in
the
Miscellanies
.
 
<EOS>
My

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
a
merry
Christmas
,
and
many
a
one
;
but
mine
be
melancholy
:
 
I
durst
not
go
to
church
to

day
,
find
myself
a
little
out
of
order
,
and
it
snow
prodigiously
,
and
freeze
.
 
<EOS>
at

I
go
to
Mrs.

who
have
this

engage
me
to
dine
there
to

day
:
 
<EOS>
and
there
I
receive
the
news
that
poor
Mrs.
Long
die
at
Lynn
in
Norfolk
on
Saturday
last
,
at
four
in
the
morning
<EOS>
:
she
be
sick
but
four
hour
.
 
<EOS>
We
suppose
it
be
the
asthma
,
which
she
be
subject
to
as
well
as
the
dropsy
,
as
she
send
me
word
in
her
last
letter
,
write
about
five
week
ago
;
but
then
say
she
be
recover
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
more
afflict
at
any
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
have
retire
to
Lynn
two
year
ago
,
to
live
cheap
,
and
pay
her
debt
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
last
letter
she
tell
me
she
hope
to
be
easy
by
Christmas
;
and
she
keep
her
word
,
although
she
mean
it
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
all
sort
of
amiable
quality
,
and
no
ill
one
,
but
the
indiscretion
of
too
much
neglect
her
own
affair
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
two
thousand
pound
leave
her
by
an
old
grandmother
,
with
which
she
intend
to
pay
her
debt
,
and
live
on
an
annuity
she
have
of
one
hundred
pound
a
year
,
and
Newburg
House
,
which
would
be
about
sixty
pound
more
.
 
<EOS>
that
odious
grandmother
live
so
long
,
force
her
to
retire
;
for
the
two
thousand
pound
be
settle
on
her
after
the
old
woman
's
death
,
yet
her
brute
of
a
brother
,
Sir
James
Long
,
would
not
advance
it
for
her
;
else
she
may
have
pay
her
debt
,
and
continue
here
,
and
live
still
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
melancholy
help
her
on
to
her
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
order
a
paragraph
to
be
put
in
the
Postboy
,
give
an
account
of
her
death
,
and
make
honourable
mention
of
her
;
which
be
all
I
can
do
to
serve
her
memory
:
 
but
one
reason
be
spite
;
for
her
brother
would
fain
have
her
death
a
secret
,
to
save
the
charge
of
bring
her
up
here
to
bury
her
,
or
go
into
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
all
this
,
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
creature
I
have
so
much
friendship
for
.
  
<EOS>
26

<EOS>
I

Mr.

me
not

of
anger

so

<EOS>
They

LONDON
,
December
29
,
1711
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
letter
in
this
evening
,
after
come
from
dinner
at
Ned
Southwell
's
,
where
I
drink
very
good
irish
wine
,
and
we
be
in
great
joy
at
this
happy
turn
of
affair
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
have
be
at
last
persuade
to
her
own
interest
and
security
,
and
I
freely
think
she
must
have
make
both
herself
and
kingdom
very
unhappy
,
if
she
have
do
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
still
a
mighty
secret
that
Masham
be
to
be
one
of
the
new
lord
;
they
say
he
do
not
yet
know
it
himself
;
but
the
Queen
be
to
surprise
him
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Secretary
will
be
a
lord
at
the
end
of
the
session
;
but
they
want
him
still
in
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
,
it
be
a
strange
unhappy
necessity
of
make
so
many
peer
together
;
but
the
Queen
have
draw
it
upon
herself
,
by
her
confound
trimming
and
moderation
.
 
<EOS>
three

as
I
tell
you
,

<EOS>
I
writ
the
Dean
and
you
a
lie
yesterday
;
for
the
Duke
of
Somerset
be
not
yet
turn
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
day
at
court
,
and
resolve
to
be
very
civil
to
the
Whigs
;
but
see
few
there
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
in
the
bed
-
chamber
talk
to
Lord
Rochester
,
he
go
up
to
Lady
Burlington
,
who
ask
him
who
I
be
;
and
Lady
Sunderland
<EOS>
and
she
whisper
about
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
desire
Lord
Rochester
to
tell
Lady
Sunderland
<EOS>
I
doubt
she
be
not
as
much
in
love
with
me
as
I
be
with
her
;
but
he
would
not
deliver
my
message
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duchess
of
Shrewsbury
come
run
up
to
me
,
and
clap
her
fan
up
to
hide
us
from
the
company
,
and
we
give
one
another
joy
of
this
change
;
but
sigh
when
we
reflect
on
the
Somerset
family
not
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
and
I
,
and
brother
Bathurst
,
and
Lord
Windsor
,
dine
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
.
 
<EOS>
Bathurst
and
Windsor
be
to
be

of
the

.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
my
Lord
Radnor
's
brother
,
at

to

day
,
to
let
my

know
I
would
call
on
him
at
six
,
which
I
do
,
and
be
argue
with
him
three
hour
to
bring
him
over
to
us
,
and
I
speak
so
closely
that
I
believe
he
will
be
tractable
;
but
he
be
a
scoundrel
,
and
though
I
say
I
only
talk
for
my
love
to
him
,
I
tell
a
lie
;
for
I
do
not
care
if
he
be
hang
:
 
but
everyone
gain
over
be
of
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Marlborough

at
Court

,
and
nobody
hardly
take
notice
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Masham

<EOS>
nothing
at

can
be
keep

.
 
<EOS>
Wednesday
will
be
a
great

<EOS>
Our
frost
be
break
since
yesterday
,
and
it
be
very
slabbery
;
yet
I
walk
to
the
City
and
dine
,
and
order
some
thing
with
the
printer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
settle
Dr.
King
in
the
Gazette
;
it
will
be
worth
two
hundred
pound
a
year
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Our
new
lord
'
patent
be
pass
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
the
expedient
,
if
we
could
have
find
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
I
have
say
this
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
be
turn
out
of
all
his
employment
:
 
<EOS>
I
shall
know
to
-
morrow
when
I
be
to
carry
Dr.
King
to
dine
with
the
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
strong
remedy
;
pray
God
the
patient
be
able
to
bear
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
Ministry
people
be
utterly
desperate
.
  
<EOS>
January
1
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
wish
my
dear
little
MD
many
happy
new
year
;
yes
,
both
Dingley
and
Stella
,
ay
and
Presto
too
,
many
happy
new
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
the
Secretary
,
and
it
be
true
that
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
be
turn
out
of
all
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Ormond
have
get
his
regiment
of
foot
-
guard
,
I
know
not
who
have
the
rest
.
<EOS>
if
the
Ministry
be
not
sure
of
a
peace
,
I
shall
wonder
at
this
step
,
and
do
not
approve
it
at
best
.
<EOS>
the
Queen
and
Lord
Treasurer
mortally
hate
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
and
to
that
he
owe
his
fall
,
more
than
to
his
other
fault
:
unless
he
have
be
tamper
too
far
with
his
party
,
of
which
I
have
not
hear
any
particular
;
however
it
be
,
the
world
abroad
will
blame
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
my
belief
that
he
have
not
one
good
quality
in
the
world
beside
that
of
a
general
,
and
even
that
I
have
hear
deny
by
several
great
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
have
constant
success
in
arm
while
he
command
.
 
<EOS>
opinion
be
a
mighty
matter
in
war
,
and
I
doubt
the
French
think
it
impossible
to
conquer
an
army
that
he
lead
,
and
our
soldier
think
the
same
;
and
how
far
even
this
step
may
encourage
the
French
to
play
trick
with
us
,
no
man
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
love
to
see
personal
resentment
mix
with
public
affair
.

.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the

the
Lords

,
and
the

I
go
to
Westminster
to
see
the
sight
;
but
the
crowd
be
too
great
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
only
go
into
the
robe

room
,
to
give
my
four
brother
joy
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Mansel
,
and
Lord
Windsor
;
the
other
six
I
be
not
acquaint
with
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
apprehend
the
Whigs
would
have
raise
some
difficulty
,
but
nothing
happen
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
see
Lady
Masham
at
noon
,
and
wish
her
joy
of
her
new
honour
,
and
a
happy
new
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
her
very
well
pleased
;
for
peerage
will
be
some
sort
of
protection
to
her
upon
any
turn
of
affair
.
 
<EOS>
She
engage
me
to

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
see
nothing
here
like
Christmas
,
except
brawn
or
mince

pie
in

where
I
dine
,
and
give
away
my
half

<EOS>

<EOS>
the

grow
brisk

would
not

who
would
fain
have
go

,
be
newly
married
to
Lady
Mary
Thynne
.
 
<EOS>
It

so
you
must
think
I

I
would
meet
him
,
and
attest
<EOS>
he
be
the
man
,
which
I
do
,
and
his
money
be
pay
upon
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
visit
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
be
now
right
again
,
and
all
well
,
only
that
the
Somerset
family
be
not
out
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
that
;
I
do
not
like
it
,
as
the
man
say
,
by
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
go
and
visit
poor
Will
Congreve
,
who
have
a
french
fellow
tamper
with
one
of
his
eye
;
he
be
almost
blind
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
some
merchant
in
the
City
,
but
could
not
see
Stratford
,
with
whom
I
have
business
.
 
<EOS>
Presto
,
leave
off
your
impertinence
,
and
answer
our
letter
,
saith
MD
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
one
of
these
day
,
when
I
have
nothing
else
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
faith
,
this
letter
be
a
week
write
,
and
not
one
side
do
yet
.
<EOS>
these
ugly
spot
be
not
tobacco
,
but
this
be
the
last
gilt
sheet
I
have
of
large
paper
,
therefore
hold
your
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Nuttal
be
surprise
when
they
give
him
bit
of
paper
instead
of
money
,
but
I
make
Ben
Tooke
put
him
in
his
geer
:
 
he
could
not
reckon
ten
pound
,
but
be
puzzle
with
the
irish
way
.
 
<EOS>
Ben
Tooke
and
my
printer
have
desire
me
to
make
them
stationer
to
the
ordnance
,
of
which
Lord
Rivers
be
Master
,
instead
of
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
hundred
pound
a
year
apiece
to
them
,
if
I
can
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
this
morning
to
Earl
Rivers
,
give
him
joy
of
his
new
employment
,
and
desire
him
to
prefer
my
printer
and
bookseller
to
be
stationer
to
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
grant
it
me
;
but
,
like
an
old
courtier
,
tell
me
it
be
wholly
on
my
account
,
but
that
he
hear
I
have
intend
to
engage
Mr.
Secretary
to
speak
to
him
,
and
desire
I
would
engage
him
to
do
so
,
but
that
,
however
,
he
do
it
only
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
Court
trick
,
to
oblige
as
many
as
you
can
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
prayer
to
poor
Mrs.
Wesley
,
who
be
very
much
out
of
order
,
instead
of
go
to
church
;
and
then
I
go
to
Court
,
which
I
find
very
full
,
in
expectation
of
see
Prince
Eugene
,
who
land
last
night
,
and
lie
at
Leicester
House
;
he
be
not
to
see
the
Queen
till
six
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
and
believe
he
come
too
late
to
do
the
Whigs
<EOS>
any
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
refuse
dining
with
the
Secretary
,
and
be
like
to
lose
my
dinner
,
which
be
at
a
private
acquaintance
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
at
six
 
to
see
the
Prince
at
Court
,
but
he
be
go
in
to
the
Queen
;
and
when
he
come
out
,
Mr.
Secretary
,
who
introduce
him
,
walk
so
near
him
that
he
quite
screen
me
from
him
with
his
great
periwig
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
a
good
passage
:
 
as
Prince
Eugene
be
go
with
Mr.
Secretary
to
Court
,
he
tell
the
Secretary
that
Hoffman
,
the
Emperor
's
Resident
,
say
to
His
Highness
that
it
be
not
proper
to
go
to
Court
without
a
long
wig
,
and
his
be
a
tie
-
up
one
:
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
the
Prince
,
"
I
know
not
what
to
do
,
for
I
never
have
a
long
periwig
in
my
life
;
and
I
have
send
to
all
my
valet
and
footman
,
to
see
whether
any
of
them
have
one
,
that
I
may
borrow
it
,
but
none
of
them
have
any
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
be
not
this
speak
very
greatly
with
some
sort
of
contempt
?
 
<EOS>
but
the
Secretary
say
it
be
a
thing
of
no
consequence
,
and
only
observe
by
gentleman
usher
.
 
<EOS>
I
sup
with
Lord
Masham
,
where
Lord
Treasurer
and
Mr.
Secretary
sup
with
us
:
 
the
first
leave
us
at
twelve
,
but
the
rest
do
not
part
till
two
,
yet
I
have
write
all
this
,
because
it
be
fresh
:
 
and
<EOS>
now
I
will
go
sleep
if
I
can
;
that
is
,
I
believe
I
shall
,
because
I
have
drink
a
little
.
  
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
to
give
the
Duke
of
Ormond
notice
of
the
honour
<EOS>
do
him
to
make
him
one
of
our
Society
,
and
to
invite
him
on
Thursday
next
to
the
Thatched
House
:
 
he
have
accept
it
with
the
gratitude
and
humility
such
a
preferment
deserve
,
but
can
not
come
till
the
next
meeting
,
because
Prince
Eugene
be
to
dine
with
him
that
day
,
which
I
allow
for
:
 
a
good
excuse
,
and
will
report
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Masham
,
and
sit
there
till
eight
this
evening
,
and
come
home
,
because
I
be
not

griped
;
but
now
I
be
well
again
,
I
will
not
go

at

.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer

and
that
tempt
me
,
but
late
sit
up
do
not
agree
with
me
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
short
and
the
long
,
and
I
will
not
do
it
;
so
take
your
answer
,
dear
little
young
woman
;
and
I
have
no
more
to
say
to
you
to
-
night
,
because
of
the
Archbishop
,
for
I
be
go

a
long
letter
to
him
,
but
not
so
politely
as
formerly

I
will
not
trust
him
.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Poh

I

I

get
four
new
cap

madam

very
fine

<EOS>
I
hope

you
before
this

and
have
bring
your
box

<EOS>
how
do
you

but
I
will
have
a
fine
thing
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
the
apron
as
good
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
shall
never
be
pay
it
;
so
all
be
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
the
quarrel
with
Sir
John
Walter
?
 
<EOS>
why

we
have
not
one
word
of
quarrel

only
he
rail
at
me
when
I
be
go
:
 
and
Lord
Keeper
and
Treasurer
tease
me
for
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nuts
to
them
;
a
serious
thing
with
a
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
may
sell
their
estate
then
,
or
hang
themselves
,
as
they
be
dispose
;
for
a
peace
there
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer

<EOS>
Your

<EOS>
Stella
be
a
good
girl
for
not
be
angry
when
I
tell
her
of

I

none
wrong
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
be
praise
that
your
disorder
lessen
;

increase
my
hope
mightily
that
they
will
go
off

<EOS>
and

but
Goody
Stoyte

Cardinal

<EOS>
I
could
not
go
sleep
last
night
till
past
two
,
and
be
wake
before
three
by
a
noise
of
people
endeavour
to
break
open
my
window
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
while
I
would
not
stir
,
think
it
may
be
my
imagination
;
but
hear
the
noise
continue
,
I
rise
and
go
to
the
window
,
and
then
it
cease
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
again
,
and
hear
it
repeat
more
violently
;
then
I
rise
and
call
up
the
house
,
and
get
a
candle
:
 
<EOS>
the
rogue
have
lift
up
the
sash
a
yard
;
there
be
great
shed
before
my
window
,
although
my
lodging
be
a
storey
high
;
and
if
they
get
upon
the
shed
they
be
almost
even
with
my
window
.
 
<EOS>
We

,
and
pane
of

break
.
 
<EOS>
the
watchman
tell
us
to

day

but
could
not
catch
them
.
 
<EOS>
They

the
neighbourhood
about
the
same
time
,
and
actually
rob
a
house
in
Suffolk
Street
,
which
be
the
next
street
but
one
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
It

seaman
discharge
from
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
call
my

,
and
find
his

empty
;
it
seem
he

lie
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
challenge
him
this
morning
as
one
of
the
robber
.
 
<EOS>
He

a
sad
dog
;
and
the

Ireland
I

discard
him
.
 
<EOS>
I

you
know
;
but
the
Duke
of
Ormond
could
not
be
with
us
,
because
he

with
Prince
Eugene
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
guinea
contribution
to
a
poet
,
who
have

Marlborough
;
the
rest
give
two
guinea
,
except
the
two
physician
,
who
follow
my
example
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
this
custom
:
 
<EOS>
the
next
time
I
will
give
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
this
evening
at
Lord
Masham
's
with
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
his
countenance
;
nor
I
do
not
like
the
posture
of
thing
well
.
       
<EOS>
We
can
not
be
stout
,
     
<EOS>
Till
Somerset
be
out
:
  
as
the
old
saying
be
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Lewis
and
I
dine
with
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
who
eat
the
most
elegantly
of
any
man
I

<EOS>
I
walk
lustily
in
the
Park
by
moonshine
till
eight
,
to
shake
off
my
dinner
and
wine
;
and
then
go
to
sup
at
Mr.
Domville
's
with
Ford
,
and
stay
till
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
tell
me
to
-
day
as
a
great
secret
that
the
Duke
of
Somerset
will
be
out
soon
,
that
the
thing
be
fix
;
but
what
shall
we
do
with
the
Duchess
?
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
Duke
will
make
her
leave
the
Queen
out
of
spite
,
if
he
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
It

LETTER
39
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
January
12,1711
-
12
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
seal
up
my
letter
this
morning
,
I
look
upon
myself
to
be
not
worth
a
groat
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
last
night
,
after
Mr.
Ford
and
I
leave
Domville
,
Ford
desire
me
to
go
with
him
for
a
minute
upon
earnest
business
,
and
then
tell
me
that
both
he
and
I
be
ruin
;
for
he
have
trust
Stratford
with
five
hundred
pound
for
ticket
for
the
lottery
,
and
he
have
be
with
Stratford
,
who
confess
he
have
lose
fifteen
thousand
pound
by
Sir
Stephen
Evans
,
who
break
last
week
;
that
he
conclude
Stratford
must
break
too
;
that
he
could
not
get
his
ticket
,
but
Stratford
make
him
several
excuse
,
which
seem
very
blind
one
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
and
Stratford
have
near
four
hundred
pound
of
mine
,
to
buy
me
five
hundred
pound
in
the
South
Sea
Company
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
home
reflect
a
little
;
nothing
concern
me
but
MD
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
all
my
philosophy
and
religion
up
;
and
,
I
thank
God
,
it
do
not
keep
me
awake
beyond
my
usual
time
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
this
morning
I
send
for
Tooke
,
whom
I
have
employ
to
buy
the
stock
of
Stratford
,
and
settle
thing
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
be
secure
;
for
Stratford
have
transfer
it
to
me
in
form
in
the
South
Sea
House
,
and
he
have
accept
it
for
me
,
and
all
be
do
on
stamped
parchment
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
would
be
further
informed
;
and
at
night
send
me
a
note
to
confirm
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
not
yet
secure
;
and
,
besides
,
be
in
pain
for
Ford
,
whom
I
first
bring
acquaint
with
Stratford
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
in
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
Domville
and
I
dine
with
Ford
to
-
day
by
appointment
:
 
the
Lord
Mansel
tell
me
at
Court
to
-
day
that
I
be
engage
to
him
;
but
Stratford
have
promise
Ford
to
meet
him
and
me
to
-
night
at
Ford
's
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
;
say
he
have
hope
to
save
himself
in
his
affair
with
Evans
.
 
<EOS>
Ford
ask
him
for
his
ticket
:
 
<EOS>
he
say
he
would
send
them
tomorrow
;
but
look
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
say
he
believe
he
have
some
of
them
about
him
,
and
give
him
as
many
as
come
to
two
hundred
pound
,
which
rejoice
us
much
;
besides
,
he
talk
so
frankly
,
that
we
may
think
there
be
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
be
there
any
more
to
be
settle
between
us
in
my
affair
?
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
no
;
and
answer
my
question
just
as
Tooke
have
get
them
from
other
;
so
I
hope
I
be
safe
.
 
<EOS>
this
have
be
a
scurvy
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
Stella
would
have
half
laugh
at
me
,
to
see
a
suspicious
fellow
like
me
overreach
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
Prince
Eugene
to
-
day
at
court
:
I
do
not
think
him
an
ugly
-
faced
fellow
,
but
well
enough
,
and
a
good
shape
.
  
<EOS>
14
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
be
to
sit
to
-
day
,
and
meet
;
but
be
adjourn
by
the
Queen
's
direction
till
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
She
design
to
make
some
important
speech
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
pretend
illness
;
but
I
believe
they
be
not
ready
,
and
they
expect
some
opposition
:
 
and
the
Scotch
lord
be
angry
,
and
must
be
pacify
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
this
morning
to
invite
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
our
Society
on
Thursday
,
where
he
be
then
to
be
introduce
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
appoint
me
at
twelve
to
-
morrow
about
some
business
:
 
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
his
help
to
impeach
a
certain
lord
;
but
I
doubt
we
shall
make
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
intend
to
have
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
,
but
I
be
tell
he
would
be
busy
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
dine
with
Mrs.
Van
;
and
at
night
I
sit
with
Lord
Masham
till
one
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
be
there
,
and
chid
me
for
not
dine
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
in
very
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
I
bring
home
two
flask
of
burgundy
in
my
chair
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
MD
have
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
it
be
very
late
;
so
I
will
go
to
bed
,
and
bid
MD
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
this
morning
I
present
my
printer
and
bookseller
to
Lord
Rivers
,
to
be
stationer
to
the
ordnance
;
stationer
,
that
be
the
word
;
I
do
not
write
it
plain
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
will
be
worth
three
hundred
pound
a
year
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
third
employment
I
have
get
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
river
tell
them
the
Doctor
command
him
,
and
he
durst
not
refuse
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer
to
-
day
again
,
but
Lord
Mansel
would
not
let
me
,
and
force
me
home
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
deep
with
the
Duke
of
Ormond
to
-
day
at
the
Cockpit
,
where
we
meet
to
be
private
;
but
I
doubt
I
can
not
do
the
mischief
I
intend
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Penn
come
there
,
Will
Penn
the
Quaker
,
at
the
head
of
his
brother
,
to
thank
the
Duke
for
his
kindness
to
their
people
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
to
see
a
dozen
scoundrel
with
their
hat
on
,
and
the
Duke
compliment
with
his
off
,
be
a
good
sight
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
this
evening
with
Sir
William
Robinson
,
who
have
mighty
often
invite
me
to
a
bottle
of
wine
:
 
<EOS>
and
it

past
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
fast
-
day
,
Dr.
Freind
and
I
go
into
the
City
to
dine
late
,
like
good
faster
.
 
<EOS>
My
printer
and
bookseller
want
me
to
hook
in
another
employment
for
them
in
the
Tower
,
because
it
be
enjoy
before
by
a
stationer
,
although
it
be
to
serve
the
ordnance
with
oil
,
tallow
,
etc
.
,
and
be
worth
four
hundred
pound
per
annum
more
:
 
I
will
try
what
I
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
resolve
to
ask
several
other
employment
of
the
same
nature
to
other
office
;
and
I
will
then
grease
fat
sow
,
and
see
whether
it
be
possible
to
satisfy
them
.
 
<EOS>
why
be
not
I
a
stationer
?
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament

to
-
morrow
,
and
Walpole
,
late
Secretary
at
War
,
be
to
be
swinge
for
bribery
,
and
the
Queen
be
to
communicate
something
of
great
importance
to
the
two
Houses
,
at
least
they
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
think
of
answer
your
letter
in
a
day
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
this
morning
to

Ormond
about
some
business
,
and
he

House
of
Commons

the
House

<EOS>
I
leave
them
at
nine
,
and
they
be
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
We
keep
some
dinner
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Walpole
will
be
send
to
the
Tower
,
and
expel
the
House
;
but
this
afternoon
the
member
I
speak
with
in
the
Court
of
Requests
talk
dubiously
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
lead
card
to
maul
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
for
the
same
crime
,
or
at
least
to
censure
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
's
message
be
only
to
give
them
notice
of
the
peace
she
be
treat
,
and
to
desire
they
will
make
some
law
to
prevent
libel
against
the
Government
;
so
farewell
to
Grub
Street
.
  
<EOS>

and
have
make

a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
We

of
twenty
thousand
pound
,
and
be
now
at
James
Broad
's

<EOS>
"
who
,
I
suppose
,
be
some
bailiff
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
of
this
;
but
at
the

of
Requests
twenty
people
tell

<EOS>
Lord

Jack
Hill
's
commission
for
Lieutenant
of
the
Tower

,
and
that
Cadogan

continue
.
 
<EOS>
Lansdowne
think
they
have
some
design
by
these
report
;
I
can
not
guess
it
.
 
<EOS>
do
I
tell
you
that
Sacheverell
have
desire
mightily
to
come
and
see
me
?
<EOS>
but
I
have
put
it
off
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
hear
that
I
have
speak
to
the
Secretary
in
behalf
of
a
brother
whom
he
maintain
,
and
who
desire
an
employment
.
 
<EOS>
T'other
day
at
the
Court
of
Requests
Dr.
Yalden
salute
me
by
name
:
 
<EOS>
Sacheverell
,
who
be
just
by
,
come
up
to
me
,
and
make
me
many
acknowledgment
and
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
last
night
I
desire
Lord
Treasurer
to
do
something
for
that
brother
of
Sacheverell
's
:
 
he
say
he
never
know
he
have
a
brother
,
but
thank
me
for
tell
him
,
and
immediately
put
his
name
in
his
table
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
let
Sacheverell
know
this
,
that
he
may
take
his
measure
accordingly
,
but
he
shall
be
none
of
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
to
-
day
privately
with
the
Secretary
,
leave
him
at
six
,
pay
a
visit
or
two
,
and
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
again
to
-
day
with
the
Secretary
,
but
could
not
despatch
some
business
I
have
with
him
,
he
have
so
much
besides
upon
his
hand
at
this
juncture
,
and
prepare
against
the
great
business
to
-
morrow
,
which
we
be
top
full
of
.
 
<EOS>
the
Minister
's
design
be
that
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
shall
be
censure
as
gently
as
possible
,
provide
his
friend
will
not
make
head
to
defend
him
,
but
if
they
do
,
it
may
end
in
some
severer
vote
.
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
,
who
be
just
now
with
him
,
tell
me
he
be
much
cast
down
,
and
fall
away
;
but
he
be
positive
,
if
he
have
but
ten
friend
in
the
House
,
that
they
shall
defend
him
to
the
utmost
,
and
endeavour
to
prevent
the
least
censure
upon
him
,
which
I
think
can
not
be
,
since
the
bribery
be
manifest
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Solomon
Medina
pay
him
six
thousand
pound
a
year
to
have
the
employment
of
provide
bread
for
the
army
,
and
the
Duke
own
it
in
his
letter
to
the
Commissioners
of
Accounts
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
night
at
Lord
Masham
's
:
 
Lord
Dupplin
take
out
my
new
little
pamphlet
,
and
the
Secretary
read
a
great
deal
of
it
to
Lord
Treasurer
:
 
<EOS>
they
all
commend
it
to
the
sky
,
and
so
do
I
,
and
they
begin
a
health
to
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
Lord
Treasurer
suspect
;
for
he
say
,
"
this
be
Mr.
Davenant
's
style
,
"
which
be
his
can
not
when
he
suspect
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
carry
the
matter
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
put
the
pamphlet
in
his
pocket
to
read
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
your

.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
make
me
promise
to
dine
with
him
today
,
after
the
Parliament
be
up
:
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
come
;
but
<EOS>
I
dine
at
my
usual
time
,
know
the
House
would
sit
late
on
this
great
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
at
a
tavern
with
Mr.
Domville
and
another
gentleman
;
I
have
not
do
so
before
these
many
month
.
<EOS>
at
ten
this
evening
I
go
to
the
Secretary
,
but
he
be
not

:
 
<EOS>
I

,
then
come

;
and
he
just
come
as
I
be

,
and
he

to
my
lodging
,
but
I
would
not
go
back
;
and
<EOS>

how
thing
have
pass
,
but
hope
all
be
well
;
and
I
will
tell
you
to
-
morrow
day
.
 
<EOS>
It

,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
send
to
me
this
morning
to
know
whether
we
should
dine
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
him
,
and
there
I
learn
that
the
question
go
against
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
by
a
majority
of
a
hundred
;
so
<EOS>
the
Ministry
be
mighty
well
satisfied
,
and
the
Duke
will
now
be
able
to
do
no
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
and
I
,
and
Lord
Masham
,
etc
.
,
dine
with
Lieutenant
-
General
Withers
,
who
be
just
go
to
look
after
the
army
in
Flanders
:
 
the
Secretary
<EOS>
and
I
leave
them
a
little
after
seven
,
and
I
be
come
home
,
and
will
now
answer
your
letter
,
because
this
go
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
 
the
box
at
Chester
;
<EOS>
oh
,
burn
that
box
,
and
hang
that
Sterne
;
I
have
desire
one
to
inquire
for
it
who
go
toward
Ireland
last
Monday
,
but
I
be
in
utter
despair
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
be
not
splenetic
;
you
see
what
plunge
the
Court
have
be
at
to
set
all
right
again
.
<EOS>
and
that
Duchess
be
not
out
yet
,
and
may
one
day
cause
more
mischief
.
<EOS>
somerset
show
all
about
a
letter
from
the
Queen
,
desire
him
to
let
his
wife
continue
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
that
rare
!
 
<EOS>
I
find
Dingley
smell
a
rat
;
because
the
whig
be
upish
;
<EOS>
but
if
ever
I
hear
that
word
again
,
I
will
uppish
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
get
your
rasp
safe
and
sound
;
do
Stella
like
her
apron
?
 
<EOS>
Your
critic
about
guarantee
of
succession
be
puppy
;
that
be
an
answer
to
the
objection
.
 
<EOS>
the
answerer
here
make
the
same
objection
,
but
it
be
wholly
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
of
your
opinion
that
Lord
Marlborough
be
use
too
hardly
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
scratch
out
passage
from
paper
and
pamphlet
<EOS>
send
me
,
before
they
be
print
,
because
I
think
them
too
severe
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
certainly
a
vile
man
,
and
have
no
sort
of
merit
beside
the
military
.
 
<EOS>
the
examiner
be
good
for
little
:
 
I
would
fain
have
hinder
the
severity
of
the
two
or
three
last
,
but
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
either
bring
your
paper
over
,
or
leave
them
with
Tooke
,
for
whose
honesty
I
will
engage
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
it
be
good
not
to
venture
them
with
me
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Stella
be
a
prophet
,
by
foretell
so
very
positively
that
all
would
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
Duke
of
Ormond
speak
against
peace
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
simpleton
,
he
be
one
of
the
staunch
we
have
for
the
Ministry
.
 
<EOS>
neither
trouble
yourself
about
the
printer
:
 
<EOS>
he
appear
the
first
day
of
the
term
,
and
be
to
appear
when
summon
again
;
but
nothing
else
will
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Chief
-
Justice
be
cool
since
this
new
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
I
will
not
split
my
journal
in
half
;
I
will
write
but
once
a
fortnight
:
 
<EOS>
but
you
may
do
as
you
will
;
which
be
,
read
only
half
at
once
,
and
t'other
half
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
your
letter
be
answer
.
 
<EOS>
(
p
#
#
#
#
on
these
blot
.
)
 
<EOS>
what
must
I
say
more
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
set
out
in
March
,
if
there
be
a
fit
of
fine
weather
;
unless
the
Ministry
desire
me
to
stay
till
the
end
of
the
session
,
which
may
be
a
month
longer
;
but
I
believe
they
will
not
:
 
for
I
suppose
the
peace
will
be
make
,
and
they
will
have
no
further
service
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
make
my
canal
fine
this
summer
,
as
fine
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
shall
see
great
neglect
among
my
quickset
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
cherry
-
tree
on
the
river
walk
be
fine
thing
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
more
of
this
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
finish
this
letter
this
morning
,
and
be
come
home
<EOS>
so
late
I
must
give
it
to
the
bellman
;
but
I
would
have
it
go
to
-
night
,
lest
you
should
think
there
be
anything
in
the
story
of
my
be
arrest
in
an
action
of
twenty
thousand
pound
by
Lord
Marlborough
,
which
I
hear
be
in
Dyer
's
letter
,
and
,
consequently
,
I
suppose
,
go
to
Ireland
.

Farewell

<EOS>
I

whom
the

will
not
admit
him
.
 
<EOS>
He

because
all
Scotland
would
detest
him

<EOS>

a
German
,
whom
I
have
never
see
,
get
access
to
me
in
my
chamber
by
Patrick

folly
,
and
gravely
desire
me
to
get
an
employment
in
the
Customs
for
a
friend
of
his
,
who
would
be
very
grateful
;
and
likewise
to
forward
a
project
of
his
own
,
for
raise
ten
thousand
pound
a
year
upon

:
 
<EOS>
I

civiller
than

;
but

the
pluck
.
 
<EOS>
He

home
early
on
purpose
to
answer
MD
's
letter
,
N.26
;
for
this
go
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
well
;
I
never
see
such
a
letter
in
all
my
life
;
so
saucy
,
<EOS>
so
journalish
,
so
sanguine
,
<EOS>
so
pretend
,
so
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
satisfy
all
your
fear
in
my
last
:
 
<EOS>
all
be
go
well
,
as
you
say
;
yet
you
be
an
impudent
slut
to
be
so
positive
;
you
will
swagger
so
upon
your
sagacity
that
we
shall
never
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
mislay
your
reply
;
I
would
certainly
print
it
,
if
I
have
it
here
:
 
<EOS>
how
long
be
it
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
half
a
sheet
:
 
be
the
answer
write
in
Ireland
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
you
shall
have
a
letter
when
you
come
from
Ballygall
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
again
who
be
out
and
who
be
in
:
 
we
can
never
get
out
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
they
say
Presto
writ
the
Conduct
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
do
they
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
whether
they
do
or
no
;
but
the
resolution
print
t'other
day
in
the
Votes
be
almost
quotation
from
it
,
and
would
never
have
pass
if
that
book
have
not
be
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
meddle
with
the
Spectator
,
let
him
fair
-
sex
it
to
the
world
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
My
disorder
be
over
,
but
blood
be
not
from
the
p
-
les
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Madam
Dingley
,
the
frost
;
why
,
we
have
a
great
frost
,
but
I
forget
how
long
ago
;
it
last
above
a
week
or
ten
day
:
 
<EOS>
I
believe
about
six
week
ago
;
but
it
do
not
break
so
soon
with
us
,
I
think
,
as
December
29
;
yet
I
think
it
be
about
that
time
,
on
second
thought
.
 
<EOS>
MD
can
have
no
letter
from
Presto
,
say
you
;
and
yet
four
day
before
you
own
<EOS>
you
have
my
thirty
-
seventh
,
unreasonable
slut
!
 
<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Gloucester
be
not
dead
,
and
I
be
as
likely
to
succeed
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
as
him
if
he
be
;
there
be
enough
for
that
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
unlikely
that
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
will
be
your
Governor
;
at
least
I
believe
the
Duke
of
Ormond
will
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Stella
again
:
 
<EOS>
why
,
really
three
edition
of
the
Conduct
,
etc
.
,
be
very
much
for
Ireland
;
it
be
a
sign
you
have
some
honest
among
you
.
 
<EOS>
well
;
I
will
do
Mr.
Manley
all
the
service
I
can
;
but
he
will
ruin
himself
.
 
<EOS>
what
business
have
he
to
engage
at
all
about
the
city
?
 
<EOS>
can
not
he
wish
his
cause
well
,
and
be
quiet
,
when
he
find
that
stir
will
do
it
no
good
,
and
himself
a
great
deal
of
hurt
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
who
should
open
my
letter
:
 
<EOS>
it
must
be
do
at
your
side
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
hear
of
any
thought
of
turn
out
Mr.
Manley
,
I
will
endeavour
to
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
have
all
the
gentleman
of
Ireland
here
upon
my
back
often
,
for
defend
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
I
have
answer
your
saucy
letter
.
 
<EOS>
My
humble
service
to
Goody
Stoyte
and
Catherine
<EOS>

for
my

<EOS>
They
say
we
hear
by
the
way
of
Calais
,
that
peace
be
very
near
concluding
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope

may
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
seal
up
my
letter
,
and

none

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
To

<EOS>
I

how
it

but
it

wonderfully
at

Mr.

<EOS>
I

afternoon

<EOS>
My
third
cold
be
now
very
troublesome
on
my
breast
,
especially
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
revolution
in
my
health
;
cold
never
use
to
return
so
soon
with
me
,
or
last
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
surprising
this
news
to
-
day
of
the
Dauphin
and
Dauphiness
both
die
within
six
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
old
King
be
almost
heart
-
broke
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
prodigious
mortification
in
his
family

<EOS>
the
Dauphin
have
leave
two
little
son
,
of
four
and
two
year
old
;
the
eld
be
sick

<EOS>
there
be
a
foolish
story
get
about
the
town
that
Lord
Strafford
,
one
of
our
plenipotentiary
,
be
in
the
interest
of
France
;
and
it
have
be
a
good
while
say
that
Lord
Privy
Seal
<EOS>
and
he
do
not
agree
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
both
long
practise
in
business
,
but
neither
of
them
of
much
part
.
 
<EOS>
Strafford
have
some
life

spirit
,
but
be
infinitely
proud
,
and
wholly
illiterate

an
address
to
the
Queen
,
to
tell
her
they
be
not
satisfied
with
the
King
of
France
's
offer
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
bring
it
in
of
a
sudden
;
and
the
Court
could
not
prevent
it
,
and
therefore
do
not
oppose
it
.
<EOS>
the
House
of
Lords
be
too
strong
in
Whigs
,
notwithstanding
the
new
creation
;
for
they
be
very
diligent
,
and
the
Tories
as
lazy
:
 
the
side
that
be
down
have
always
most
industry
.
 
<EOS>
the
Whigs
intend
to
have
make
a
vote
that
would
reflect
on
Lord
Treasurer
;
but
their
project
be
not
ripe
.
 
<EOS>
I
hit
my

<EOS>
I

a
dozen
year
young
,
I
would
cultivate
his
favour
,
and
trust
my
fortune
with
his
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
care
oo
for
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
when
I
come
first
acquaint
with
this
Ministry
that
I
do
not
send
you
their
name
and
character
,
and
then
you
would
have
relish
what
I
would
have
writ
,
especially
if
I
have
let
you
into
the
particular
of
affair
:
 
but
enough
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Nite

<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
I
go
early
this
morning
to
the
Secretary
,
who
be
not
yet
well
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Hanmer
and
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
come
while
I
be
there
,
and
he
would
not
let
me
stir
;
so
I
do
not
go
to
church
,
but
be
busy
with
them
till
noon
,
about
the
affair
I
tell
you
in
my
last
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
two
go
away
;
and
I
dine
with
the
Secretary
,
and
find
my
head
very
much
out
of
order
,
but
no
absolute
fit
;
and
I
have
not
be
well
all
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
shake
me
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
sit
up
very
late
at
Lord
Masham
's
,
and
have
writ
much
for
several
day
past
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
amend
both
;
for
I
have
now
very
little
business
,
and
hope
I
shall
have
no
more
,
and
I
be
resolve
to
be
a
great
rider
this
summer
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
see
Mrs.
Wesley
this
evening
,
who
have
be
somewhat
well
for
this
month
past
,
and
talk
of
return
to
the
Bath
in
a
few
week
.
 
<EOS>
Our
peace
go
on
but
slowly
;
the
Dutch
be
play
trick
,
and
we
do
not
push
it
strongly
as
we
ought
.
 
<EOS>
the
fault
of
our
Court
be
delay
,
of
which
the
Queen
have
a
great
deal
;
and
Lord
Treasurer
be
not
without
his
share
.
<EOS>
but
pay
richar
MD
<EOS>
ret
<EOS>
us
know
a
little
of
your
life
and
tonvelsasen
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
play
at
ombre
,
or
visit
the
Dean
,
and
Goody
Walls
and
Stoytes
and
Manleys
,
as
usual
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
a
letter
from
oo
,
to
fill
the
other
side
of
this
sheet
.
<EOS>
let
me
know
what
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
be
my
aunt
alive
yet
?
  
<EOS>
oh
,
pray
,
now
I
think
of
it
,
be
so
kind
to
step
to
my
aunt
,
and
take
notice
of
my
great
-
grandfather
's
picture
;
you
know
he
have
a
ring
on
his
finger
,
with
a
seal
of
an
anchor
and
dolphin
about
it
;
but
I
think
there
be
besides
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
picture
,
the
same
coat
of
arm
quarter
with
another
,
which
I
suppose
be
my
great
-
grandmother
's
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
so
,
it
be
a
strong
argument
than
the
seal
.
 
<EOS>
and
pray
see
whether
you
think
that
coat
of
arm
be
draw
at
the
same
time
with
the
picture
,
or
whether
it
be
of
a
later
hand
;
and
ask
my
aunt
what
she
know
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
there
be
no
such
coat
of
arm
on
the
picture
,
and
I
only
dream
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
reason
be
,
because
I
would
ask
some
herald
here
,
whether
I
should
choose
that
coat
,
or
one
in
Guillim
's
large
folio
of
heraldry
,
where
my
uncle
Godwin
be
name
with
another
coat
of
arm
of
three
stag
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
sad
stuff
to
rite
;
so

cure
his
cold

and
we
be

at
two
arabian

<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
's
coach
overtook
us
,
with
his
Grace
and
Lord
Godolphin
in
it
;
but
they
do
not
see
us
,
to
our
great
satisfaction
;
for
neither
of
us
desire
that
either
of
those
two
lord
should
see

together
.
<EOS>
there

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
I
dine
with
the

field
;
the

be
grow
pure
and
long
;
then
I
go
to
visit
Perceval

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
Countess

that
,
wherever

,
people
be
ask
me
whether
I

<EOS>
I

and
have
be
amuse
myself
with
look
into
one
of
Rymer

volume
of
the
Records
of
the
Tower
,
and
be
mighty
easy
to
think
I
have
no
urgent
business
upon
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
My
third

not
yet

;
I
sometimes
cough
,
and
be
not
right
with
it
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
do
I
tell
you
that
I

be
Lady
Masham
's
hot
room
that
give
it
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
never

and
in

I
believe
both
my

and
myself

People

but
they
do
not
understand
the
virtue
of
leap

<EOS>
I

It

I

reckon
there

by

and
consequently

beginning
of
the

,
and
he
be
not
so
merry

in

,
the
majority
in
the
House
of
Lords
be
a
very
weak
one
:
 
and
he
have
much
ado
to
keep
it
up
;
and
he
be
not
able
to
make
those
remove
he
would
,
and
oblige
his
friend
;
and
I
doubt
too
he
do
not
take
care
enough
about
it
,
or
rather
can
not
do
all
himself
,
and
will
not
employ
other
:
 
which
be
his
great
fault
,
as
I

<EOS>
I

second
letter
in

till
evening

and

I

to
see
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
have
take
physic
,
and
be
drink
his
broth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
with
the
Secretary
before
,
to
recommend
a
friend
,
one
Dr.
Freind
,
to
be
Physician
-
General
;
and
the
Secretary
promise
to
mention
it
to
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
I
can

<EOS>
then
I

the

to
dine
with
Lord
Masham

when
we
drink
the

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
what
Joe
ask
be
entirely

I

whim
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
know
not

speak
to
him
;
and
if
it

<EOS>
They

and
to
think

matter
at
random
be
a
jest
.
 
<EOS>
do
I

<EOS>
no

sinkerton

'
tis
not
a
sign
of
health
,
but
a
sign
that
,
if
it
have
not
come
out
,
some
terrible
fit
of
sickness
would
have
follow
.
 
<EOS>
I

at
our
Society
last
Thursday
,
to
receive
a
new

the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer

<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
peace

I
hope

soon

or
at

the
first

<EOS>
My
letter
to
Lord
Treasurer

of

which
I
never

It

a
Scotch
gentleman

a

but
they
put
it
upon

.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament

hardly
be
up
till
June
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
like
to
be
undo
some
day
ago
with
a
tack

but
we
carry
it
bravely
,
and
the
Whigs
come
in

us

His

LETTER

<EOS>
LONDON
,
May
31
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
yet
arrive
to
my
journal
letter
,
my
pain
continue
still
,
though
with
less
violence
;
but
I
do
not
love
to
write
journal
while
I
be
in
pain
;
and
above
all
,
not
journal
to
MD
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
I
be
so
much
mend
,
<EOS>
that
I
intend
my
next
<EOS>
shall
be
in
the
old
way
;
and
yet
I
shall
,
perhaps
,
break
my
resolution
when
I
feel
pain
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
lose
credit
with
you
,
in
relation
to
my
come
over
;
but
I
protest
it
be
impossible
for
one
who
have
anything
to
do
with
this
Ministry
to
be
certain
when
he
fix
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
business
which
,
till
it
take
some
turn
or
other
,
I
can
not
leave
this
place
in
prudence
or
honour
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
wish
so
much
as
now
that
I
have
stay
in
Ireland
;
but
the
die
be
cast
,
and
be
now
a
spinning
,
and
till
it
settle
,
I
can
not
tell
whether
it
be
an
ace
or
a
sise
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
confident
by
what
you
know
yourself
,
that
you
will
justify
me
in
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
I
be
use
ill
,
I
will
leave
them
;
but
know
not
how
to
do
it
while
thing
be
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
the
session
will
soon
be
over
(
I
believe
in
a
fortnight
)
,
and
the
peace
,
we
hope
,
will
be
make
in
a
short
time
;
and
there
will
be
no
further
occasion
for
me
;
nor
have
I
anything
to
trust
to
<EOS>
but
Court
gratitude
,
so
that
I
expect
to
see
my
willow
a
month
after
the
Parliament
be
up
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
take
MD
in
my
way
,
and
not
go
to
Laracor
like
an
unmannerly
spraenekich
ferrow
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
see
my
letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
answer
come
out
to
it
already
;
though
it
be
no
politic
,
but
a
harmless
proposal
about
the
improvement
of
the
English
Tongue
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
if
I
writ
an
essay
upon
a
straw
some
fool
would
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
about
ten
day
hence
I
expect
a
letter
from
MD
;
N.30
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
now
write
it
,
near
the
end
,
as
I
guess
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
receive
DD
's
money
;
but
I
will
give
you
a
note
for
it
on
Parvisol
,
and
bed
oo
paadon
I
have
not
do
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
just
now
think
to
go
lodge
at
Kensington
for
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Masham
have
tease
me
to
do
it
,
but
business
have
hinder
me
;
but
now
Lord
Treasurer
have
remove
thither
.
 
<EOS>
fifteen
of
our
Society
dine
together
under
a
canopy
in
an
arbour
at
Parson
's
Green
last
Thursday
:
 
I
never
see
anything
so
fine
and
romantic
.
 
<EOS>
We
get
a
great
victory
last
Wednesday
in
the
House
of
Lords
by
a
majority
,
I
think
,
of
twenty
-
eight
;
and
the
Whigs
have
desire
their
friend
to
bespeak
place
to
see
Lord
Treasurer
carry
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
I
meet
your
Higgins
here
yesterday
:
he
roar
at
the
insolence
of
the
Whigs
in
Ireland
,
talk
much
of
his
own
suffering
and
expense
in
assert
the
cause
of
the
Church
;
and
I
find
he
would
fain
plead
merit
enough
to
desire
that
his
fortune
should
be
mend
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
design
to
make
as
much
noise
as
he
can
in
order
to
preferment
.
<EOS>
pray
let
the
Provost
,
when
he
see
you
,
give
you
ten
english
shilling
,
and
I
will
give
as
much
here
to
the
man
who
deliver
me
Rymer
's
book
:
 
<EOS>
he
know
the
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
tell
him
I
will
not
trust
him
,
but
that
you
can
order
it
to
be
pay
me
here
;
and
I
will
trust
you
till
I
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
tell
you
that
the
rogue
Patrick
have
leave
me
these
two
month
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
another
,
who
seem
to
be
much
well
,
if
he
continue
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
print
a
threepenny
pamphlet
,
and
shall
print
another
in
a
fortnight
,
and
then
I
have
do
,
unless
some
new
occasion
start
.
 
<EOS>
be
my
curate
Warburton
marry
to
Mrs.
Melthrop
in
my
parish
?
<EOS>
so
I
hear
.
 
<EOS>
or
be
it
a
lie
?
 
<EOS>
have
Raymond
get
to
his
new

?
 
<EOS>
do
you
see
Joe
now
and
then

<EOS>
what
luck
have
you
at
ombre
?
 
<EOS>
how
stand
it
with
the
Dean
?
.
.

<EOS>
My
service
to
Mrs.
Stoyte
,
and
Catherine
,
if
she
be
come
from
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
see
Dilly
Ashe
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
once
,
but
she
be
not
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
be
under
the
doctor
's
hand
.
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
news
of
the
Duke
of
Ormond
produce
letter
in
the
council
of
war
,
with
order
not
to
fight
,
will
surprise
you
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
say
in
the
House
of
Lords
that
in
a
few
day
the
treaty
of
peace
should
be
lay
before
them
;
and
our
Court
think
it
wrong
to
hazard
a
battle
,
and
sacrifice
many
life
in
such
a
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
peace
hold
,
all
will
do
well
,
otherwise
I
know
not
how
we
shall
weather
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
reckon
as
a
wrong
step
in
politic
for
Lord
Treasurer
to
open
himself
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
would
not
go
so
far
to
satisfy
the
Whigs
in
the
House
of
Commons
;
but
there
all
go
swimmingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more

because
I
must
send
away
the

KENSINGTON

1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
tosticate
about
since
my
last
,
that
I
could
not
go
on
in
my
journal
manner
,
though
my
shoulder
be
a
great
deal
better
;
however
,
I
feel
constant
pain
in
it
,
but
I
think
it
diminish
,
and
I
have
cut
off
some
slice
from
my
flannel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lodge
here
near
a
fortnight
,
partly
for
the
air
and
exercise
,
partly
to
be
near
the
Court
,
where
dinner
be
to
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
I
generally
get
a
lift
in
a
coach
to
town
,
and
in
the
evening
I
walk
back
.
 
<EOS>
on
Saturday
I
dine
with
the
Duchess
of
Ormond
at
her
lodge
near
Sheen
,
and
think
to
get
a
boat
back
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
by
the
bank
to
Cue
[
Kew
]
,
but
no
boat
,
then
to
Mortlake
,
but
no
boat
,
and

nine
o'clock

<EOS>
at

full
of
nasty
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
him
set
me
down
at
Hammersmith
,
so
walk
two
mile
to
this
place
,
and
get
here
by
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
last
night
I
have
another
such
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
City
till
past
ten
at
night
;
it
rain
hard
,
but
no
coach
to
be
have
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
over
a
little
,
and
I
walk
all
the
way
here
,
and
get
home
by
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
these
shabby
difficulty
when
they
be
over
;
but
I
hate
them
,
because
they
arise
from
not
have
a
thousand
pound
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
your
N.30
about
three
day
ago
,
which
I
will
now
answer
.
 
<EOS>
and
first
,
I
do
not
relapse
,
but
find
I
come
out
before
I
ought
;
and
so
,
and
so
,
as
I
have
tell
you
in
some
of
my
last
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
come
abroad
make
people
think
I
be
quite
recover
,
and
I
have
no
more
message
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
John
Bull
be
not
writ
by
the
person
you
imagine
,
as
hope
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
good
for
another
to
own
.
 
<EOS>
have
it
be
Grub
Street
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
let
people
think
as
they
please
;
and
I
think
that
be
right
:
 
be
not
it
now
?
<EOS>
so
flap

and
make
wry
<EOS>

<EOS>
be

<EOS>
be
I
a

<EOS>
can
I
work

<EOS>
can

<EOS>
now
I

Dr.
Smith
.
 
<EOS>
I
drink
little
water
with
my
wine
,
yet
I
believe
he
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
yet
Dr.
Cockburn
tell
me
a
little
wine
would
not
hurt
me
;
but
it
be
so
hot
and
dry
,
and
water
be
so
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
thing
here
be
my
evening
at
Lord
Masham

,
where
Lord
Treasurer
come
,
and

I
need

<EOS>
but
I
hope
that
will
be
at
an
end
in
a
month
or
two
,
one
way
or
other
,
and
I
be
resolve
it
shall
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
go
to
Tunbridge
,
or
anywhere
else
out
of
the
way
,
in
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
so
Ppt
design
for
Templeoag
<EOS>
(
what
a
name
be
that
!
)
.
 
<EOS>
Whereabouts
be
that
place
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
very
far
from
Dublin
.
<EOS>
Higgins
be
here
,
roar
that
all
be
wrong
in
Ireland
,
and
would
have
me
get
him
an
audience
of
Lord
Treasurer
to
tell
him
so
;
but
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
in
it
,
no
,
not
I
,
faith

<EOS>
We
have
have
no
thunder
till
last
night
,
and
till
then
we
be
dead
for
want
of
rain
;
but
there
fall
a
great
deal
:
 
<EOS>
no
field
look
green
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
the
Queen
will
go
to
Windsor
in
three
or
four
week
:
and
if
the
Secretary
take
a
house
there
,
I
shall
be
sometimes
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
affectedly
Ppt
talk
of
my
being
here
all
the
summer
;
which
I
do
not
intend
:
 
nor
<EOS>
to
stay
one
minute
longer
in
England
than
become
the
circumstance
I
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
go
soon
into
the
country
,
and
take
a
good
deal
of
it
;
and
where
well
than
Trim

<EOS>
Joe

be
your
humble

,
parvisol
your
slave
,
and
Raymond
at
your

,
for
he
pique
himself
on

<EOS>
I
have

I
have

once
or
twice
<EOS>
old

<EOS>
He

very
well

<EOS>
I
believe
I
must
go
see
his
wife
,
when
I
have
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
see
Goody
Stoyte

her
husband
;
pray
give
them
my
humble

and
to
Mrs.
Walls
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
least
bit
in

with
Mrs.

<EOS>
I
suppose
the

increase
with
the
fruitfulness
of
the
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
grad
at

to

<EOS>
I
hear
somebody
come

I

and
I

afraid

that

if

Molt

so

now
your

impartially

not

<EOS>
I
believe
,
if
I
writ
an
essay
upon
a
straw

I
should
have
a
shoal
of
answerer
:
 
but
no
matter
for
that

you
see
I
can
answer

make
any
reflection
,
as
become
man
of
learning

<EOS>
well
,
but
now
for
the
peace
:
 
<EOS>
why

we
expect

but
the
French
have
the
staff
in
their
own
hand
,
and
we
trust
to
their
honesty

<EOS>
I

now
in
the
way

six

and
the

He

Hill

and
I
persuade

<EOS>
I

and
get
two
hundred
pound

employment
in
England
of
its
bigness
;
yet
the

He

it
not

to
the

by
appointment
,
to
prove
to
Her
Majesty
,
out
of
Daniel
and
the
Revelations
,
that
four
year
hence
there
would
be
a

of

;
that
the
King
of
France

be
a
Protestant
,
and
fight
on
their
side
;
that
the
Popedom
would
be
destroy

etc
.
;
and
declare
that
he
would
be
content
to
give
up
his
bishopric
if

not
true
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
,
who
tell
it
me
,
be
by
,
and
some
other
;
and
I
be
tell
Lord
Treasurer
confound
him
sadly
in
his
own
learning
,
which
make
the
old
fool
very
quarrelsome
.
 
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Old

have

Toland

<EOS>
how
do
you
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
an
imitation
of
horace
,
and
perhaps
you
do
not
understand
horace
.
 
<EOS>
here
have
be
a
great
sweep
of
employment
,
and
we
expect
still
more
removal
.
 
<EOS>
the
Court
seem
resolve
to
make
thorough
work
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Hill
intend
to
set
out
to

morrow
for
Dunkirk

We

He
desire
I

I
excuse
myself
from
a
work
that
may
lose
me
a
great
deal
of
reputation
,
and
get
me
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
fain
have
the
Court
make
him
an
earl
,
but
it
would
not
be
;
and
therefore
he
will
not
take
the
title
of
Bullenbrook
,
which
be
lately
extinct
in
the
elder
branch
of
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
advise
him
to
be
call
Lord
Pomfret
;
but
he
think
that
title
be
already
in
some
other
family
;
and
,
besides
,
he
object
that
it
be
in
Yorkshire
,
where
he
have
no
estate
;
but
there
be
nothing
in
that
,
and
I
love
Pomfret
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
love
Pomfret

<EOS>
why
?

Castle

<EOS>
I
see
him
as
often
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Master
Ashe
have
a
sad
redness
in
his
face
;
it
be
St.
Anthony
's
fire
;
his
face
all
swell
,
and
will
break
in
his
cheek
,
but
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
since
Dunkirk
have
be
in
our
hand
,
Grub
Street
have
be
very
fruitful
.
 
<EOS>
pdfr
have
writ
five
or
six
Grub
Street
paper
this
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
see
Toland

invitation
to
Dismal
,
or
Hue
and
Cry
after
Dismal
,
or
Ballad
on
Dunkirk
,
or
argument
that
Dunkirk
be
not
in
our
hand
?
 
<EOS>
Poh
!
<EOS>
you
have
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
dead
here
with
the
hot
weather
;
yet
I
walk
every
night
home
,
and
believe
it
do
me
good
:
<EOS>
but
my
shoulder
be
not
yet
right
;
itching
,
and
scratching
,
and
small
aching
.
 
<EOS>
do
I
tell
you
I
have
make
Ford
Gazetteer
,
with
two
hundred
pound
a
year
salary
,
beside
perquisite
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
letter
lately
from
Parvisol
,
who
say
my
canal
look
very
finely
;
I
long
to
see
it
;
but
no
apple
;
all
blast
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
there
will
be
a
triennial
visitation
in
August
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
send
Raymond
another
proxy
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
I
will
answer
oo
rettle
N.33
,
date
June
17
.
 
<EOS>
Ppt
write
as
well
as
ever
,
for
all
her
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
never
come
here
,
as
often
and
as
heartily
as
Ppt
.
 
<EOS>
what
have
I
to
do
here
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
the
Bishop
's
make
me
uneasy
,
but
I
do
not
think
it
be
because
I
never
writ
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
would
make
me
write
to
him
,
but
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
be
oblige
to
the
Provost
for
keep
the
Bishop
from
be
impertinent
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Maram
DD
,
but
oo
would
not
be
content
with
letter
flom
pdfr
of
six
line
,
or
twelve
either
,
fais
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Ppt
will
have
do
with
the
water
soon
,
and
find
benefit
by
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
if
they
be
as
far
off
as
Wexford
,
they
would
do
as
much
good
;
for
I
take
the
journey
to
contribute
as
much
as
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
's
be
here
do
not
in
the
least
affect
my
staying
or
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
talk
to
Higgins
but
once
in
my
life
in
the
street
,
and
I
believe
he
and
I
shall
hardly
meet
but
by
chance
.
 
<EOS>
what
care
I
whether
my
letter
to
Lord
Treasurer
be
commend
there
or
no
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
not
somebody
among
you
answer
it
,
as
three
or
four
have
do
here
?
 
<EOS>
(
I
be
now
sit
with
nothing
but
my
nightgown
,
for
heat
.
)
 
<EOS>
Ppt
shall
have
a
great
Bible
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
it
down
in
my
memlandum
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
and
DD
shall
be
repay
her
t'other
book
;
but
patience
,
all
in
good
time
:
 
<EOS>
you
be
so
hasty
,
a
dog
would
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
so
Ppt
have
neither
win
nor
lose
.
<EOS>
why
,
mun
,
I
play
sometimes
too
at
picket
,
that
be
picquet
,
I
mean
;
but
very
seldom
.
 
<EOS>

?
<EOS>
why
,
'
tis
only
at
Lady
Masham

and
that
be
in
our
town
;
but
I
never
come
late
here
from
London
,
except
once
in
rain
,
when
I
could
not
get
a
coach
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
very
little
thunder
here
;
none

two

.
<EOS>
why

pray
,
madam

how
do
the

hinder

from

<EOS>
You
hear
Secretary
St.
John
be
make
Viscount
Bullinbrook
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
persuade
him
to
take
that
title
,
because
the
eld
branch
of
his
family
have
it
in
an
earldom
,
and
it
be
last
year
extinct
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
take
it
,
I
advise
him
to
be
Lord
Pomfret
,
which
I
think
be
a
noble
title
.
 
<EOS>
You
hear
of
it
often
in
the
chronicle
,
Pomfret
Castle
:
 
<EOS>
but
we
believe
it
be
among
the
title
of
some
other
lord
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Hill
send
his
sister
a
pattern
of
a
head

dress
from
Dunkirk
;
it
be
like
our
fashion
twenty
year
ago
,
only
not
quite
so
high
,
and
look
very
ugly
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
Trapp
chaplain
to
Lord
Bullinbroke
,
and
he
be
mighty
happy
and
thankful
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
I

Pray

<EOS>
He

me

Lord
Bulingbrook
would
not
let
me
go
away
till
two
;
and
I
be
now
in

very
lazy

I

LETTER
51
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
,
August
7
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
your
n.32
at
Windsor
:
 
<EOS>
I
just
read
it
,
and
immediately
seal
it
up
again
,
and
shall
read
it
no
more
this
twelvemonth
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
the
reason
of
my
resentment
at
it
be
,
because
you
talk
as
glibly
of
a
thing
as
if
it
be
do
,
which
,
for
aught
I
know
,
be
farther
from
be
do
than
ever
,
since
I
hear
not
a
word
of
it
,
though
the
town
be
full
of
it
,
and
the
Court
always
give
me
joy
and
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
would
have
let
you
know
as
soon
as
it
be
do
;
but
I
believe
you
fancy
I
would
affect
not
to
tell
it
you
,
but
let
you
learn
it
from
newspaper
and
report
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
only
there
be
something
in
your
letter
about
me
's
money
,
and
that
shall
be
take
care
of
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
Windsor
on
Monday
last
,
upon
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
's
be
go
to
France
,
and
somebody
be
be
here
that
I
ought
often
to
consult
with
in
an
affair
I
be
upon
:
 
but
<EOS>
that
person
talk
of
return
to
Windsor
again
,
and
I
believe
I
shall
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
a
hedge
-
lodge
very
busy
,
as
I
be
every
day
till
noon
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
so
that
this
letter
be
like
to
be
short
,
and
you
be
not
to
blame
me
these
two
month
;
for
I
protest
,
if
I
study
ever
so
hard
,
I
can
not
in
that
time
compass
what
I
be
upon
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
fever
both
here
and
at
Windsor
,
which
hardly
anybody
miss
;
but
it
last
not
above
three
or
four
day
,
and
kill
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
have
forty
servant
down
of
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
dine
yesterday
with
Treasurer
,
but
could
do
no
business
,
though
he
send
for
me
,
I
think
,
on
purpose
;
but
he
desire
I
will
dine
with
him
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Windsor
be
a
most
delightful
place
,
and
at
this
time
abound
in
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
My
lodging
there
look
upon
Eton
and
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
owner
of
them
;
they
belong
to
a
prebend
.
 
<EOS>
God
know
what
be
in
your
letter
;
and
if
it
be
not
answer
,
whose
fault
be
it
,
sauci
dallar
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
Grub
Street
be
dead
and
go
last
week
?
 
<EOS>
no
more
ghost
or
murder
now
for
love
or
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
ply
it
pretty
close
the
last
fortnight
,
and
publish
at
least
seven
penny
paper
of
my
own
,
besides
some
of
other
people
's
:
 
but
now
every
single
half
-
sheet
pay
a
halfpenny
to
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
the
Observator
be
fall
;
the
Medleys
be
jumble
together
with
the
Flying
Post
;
the
Examiner
be
deadly
sick
;
the
Spectator
keep
up
,
and
double
its
price
;
I
know
not
how
long
it
will
hold
.
<EOS>
have
you
see
the
red
stamp
the
paper
be
mark
with
?
 
<EOS>
Methinks
it
be
worth
a
halfpenny
,
the
stamp

.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bolingbroke
and

WINDSOR

September
15
,
1712
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
long
without
write
to
MD
as
now
,
since
I
leave
them
,
nor
ever
will
again
while
I
be
able
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
expect
from
one
week
to
another
that
something
would
be
do
in
my
own
affair
;
but
nothing
at
all
be
,
nor
I
do
not
know
when
anything
will
,
or
whether
ever
at
all
,
so
slow
be
people
at
do
favour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
much
out
of
order
of
late
with
the
old
giddiness
in
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
a
vomit
for
it
two
day
ago
,
and
will
take
another
about
a
day
or
two
hence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
eat
mighty
little
fruit
;
yet
I
impute
my
disorder
to
that
little
,
and
shall
henceforth
wholly
forbear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
engage
in
a
long
work
,
and
have
do
all
I
can
of
it
,
and
wait
for
some
paper
from
the
Ministry
for
material
for
the
rest
;
and
they
delay
me
,
as
if
it
be
a
favour
I
ask
of
them

God

Lord

I
would
recommend
Raymond

the
Duke

not
for

<EOS>
I

and
be
deep
in
pill
with
asafoetida
,
and
a
steel
bitter
drink
;
and
I
find
my
head
much
better
than
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
discourage
;
for
I
use
to
be
ill
for
three
or
four
day
together
,
ready
to
totter
as
I

.
 
<EOS>
I

and

I

<EOS>
the

,
Lord

,
Lady

and

,
but
be

;
only
Lady
Masham
expect
every
day
to
lie
in
at
Kensington
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
never
such
a
lump
of
lie
spread
about
the
town
together
as
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
will
have
them
in
Dublin
before
this
come
to
you
,
and
all
without
the
least
ground
of
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
mightily
put
backward
in
something
I
be
write
by
my
illness
,
but
hope
to
fetch
it
up
,
so
as
to
be
ready
when
the
Parliament
meet
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer

have

<EOS>
I

t'other
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
us
all
twelvepence
apiece
to
begin
with
:
 
<EOS>
it
put
me
in
mind
of
Sir
William
Temple
.
<EOS>
I
ask
both
him
and
Lady
Masham
seriously
whether
the
Queen
be
at
all
incline
to
a
dropsy
,
and
they
positively
assure
me
she
be
not
:
 
so
do
her
physician
Arbuthnot
,
who
always
attend
her
.
 
<EOS>
yet
these
devil
have
spread
that
she
have
hole
in
her
leg
,
and
run
at
her
navel
,
and
<EOS>
I
know

what
.
<EOS>
Arbuthnot
have
send
me
from
Windsor
a
pretty
discourse
upon
lying
,
and
I
have
order
the
printer
to
come
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
proposal
for
publish
a
curious
piece
,
call
the
Art
of
Political
Lying
,
in
two
volume
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
an
abstract
of
the
first
volume
,
just
like
those
pamphlet
which
they
call
the
Works
of
the
Learned
.
 
<EOS>
pray
get
it
when
it
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
Queen
have
a
little
of
the
gout
in
one
of
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
she
will
stay
a
month
still
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
show
me
the
kind
letter
from
her
in
the
world
,
by
which
I
pick
out
one
secret
,
that
there
will
be
soon
make
some
Knights
of
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
another

Lord
Godolphin

Westminster
Abbey

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
the
Bishop
of
Clogher
have
take
his
lodging

<EOS>
I
hear
there
be
in
town
abundance
of
people
from
Ireland
;
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
bishop

.
<EOS>
the
poor
old
Bishop
of
London
,
at
past
fourscore
,
fall
down
backward
go
upstairs
,
and
I
think
break
or
crack
his
skull
;
yet
be
now
recover

<EOS>
the
town
be
as
empty
as
at
midsummer
;
and
if
I
have
not
occasion
for
physic
,
I
would
be
at
Windsor
still
.
 
<EOS>
do
I
tell
you

Lord
Rivers

will
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
leave
legacy
to
about
twenty
paltry
old
whore
by
name
,
and
not
a
farthing
to
any
friend
,
dependent
,
or
relation
:
 
he
have
leave
from
his
only
child
,
Lady
Barrymore
,
her
mother
's
estate
,
and
give
the
whole
to
his
heir
-
male
,
a
popish
priest
,
a
second
cousin
,
who
be
now
Earl
Rivers
,
and
whom
he
use
in
his
life
like
a
footman
.
 
<EOS>
after
him

to
his
chief
wench
and
bastard
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Treasurer
and
Lord
Chamberlain
be
executor
of
this
hopeful
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
the
man
,
and
detest
his
memory
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear

<EOS>
I

verily
the
Dutch
be
so
wilful

because

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
as

so
tell

<EOS>
the
Parliament

Christmas
,
and
by
that
time
the
work
I
be
do
will
be
over
,
and
then
nothing
shall
keep
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
discontent
at
Parvisol
,
about
neglect
to
sell
my
horse
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Masham

;
but
we
expect
it
daily
.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Lord

<EOS>
I

day
from
Dr.
Coghill
,
desire
me
to
get
Raphoe
for
Dean
Sterne
,
and
the
deanery
for
myself

<EOS>
I
shall
indeed
,
I
have
such
obligation
to
Sterne
.
 
<EOS>
but
however
,
if
I
be
ask
who

I

.
 
<EOS>
then

a
Provost

suppose
that
Pratt
(
who

promote
;
but
I
believe
he
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
present
Pratt
to
Lord
Treasurer
,
and
truly
young
Molyneux
would
have
have
me
present
him
too
;
but
I
directly
answer
him
I
would
not
,
unless
he
have
business

<EOS>
He

Mr.
Molyneux
of

which
cause
many
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
some
say
he
be
conscious
of
guilt
,
and
dare
not
stand
it
.
 
<EOS>
other
think
he
have
a
mind
to
fle
an
odium
on
the
Government
,
as
who
should
say
that
one
who
have
do
such
great
service
to
his
country
can
not
live
quietly
in
it
,
by
reason
of
the
malice
of
his
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
help
to
patch
up
these
people
together
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
God
know
how
long
it
may
last
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
-
day
at
a
trial
between
Lord
Lansdowne
and
Lord
Carteret
,
two
friend

<EOS>
It
be
in
the
Queen
's
Bench
,
for
about
six
thousand
a
year
(
or
nine
,
I
think
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
under
Lord
Chief
-
Justice
Parker
,
and
his
pen
fall
down
<EOS>
I
reach
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
me
a
low
bow
;
and
I
be
go
to
whisper
him
that
I
have
do
good
for
EVIL
;
for
he
WOULD
have
TAKEN
MINE
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
it
Lord

and
Bolingbroke
.
<EOS>
Parker
would
not

,
if
several
lord

,
and
in
the
court
,
bowing
,
have
not
turn
everybody
's
eye
,
and
set
them
a
whispering
.
 
<EOS>
I
owe
the
dog
a
spite
,
and
will
pay
him
in
two
month
at
furth
,
if
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
so
much
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
have
chat
,
and
<EOS>
I
must
say
every
sorry
thing
that
come
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
the
Queen
will
stay
a
month
longer
at
Windsor

<EOS>
these
devil
of
Grub
Street
rogue
,
that
write
the
Flying

will
not
be

<EOS>
They

always
maul
Lord
Treasurer
,
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
and
me

<EOS>
We
have
the

Bolingbroke

I

He

a
Scotch
rogue

one
Ridpath

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
We
take
them
again
,
and
get
fresh

so

<EOS>
They
say
some
learn
Dutchman
have
write
a
book
,
prove
by
civil
law
that
we
do
them
wrong
by
this
peace
;
but
I
shall
show
by
plain
reason
that
we
have
suffer
the
wrong
,
and
not
they

<EOS>
I
toil
like
a

and
have
hundred

squeeze
a

<EOS>
Strafford

I

thirty

that

)
,
which
will
be
sixty

<EOS>
It
be
the
most
troublesome
part
of
all
,
and
I
can
not
keep
myself
private
,
though
I
steal
into
a
room
up
two
pair
of
stair
,
when
I

<EOS>
I
propose
writing
controversy
,
to
get
a

with
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke

<EOS>
I
desire

<EOS>
I
have
order
the
Duchess

let
me
have
an
hour
with
the
Duke
at
his
first
coming
,
to
give
him
a
true
state
of
person
and
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
Duke
of
Shrewsbury
will
hardly
be
declare
your
Governor
yet
;
at
least
,
I
think
so
now
;
but
resolution
alter
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Hamilton

me
a
pound
of
snuff

admirable
good

<EOS>
I
wish
DD
have
it

and
<EOS>
Ppt
too

if
she
like
it

<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of

which
I
be
force
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Orkney

table
of
her
own
contrivance
,
and
a
bed
nightgown
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
perfectly
kind
,
like
a
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
devil
be
in
it
the
other
day
,
that
I
should
talk
to
her
of
an
ugly
squinting
cousin
of
hers
,
and
the
poor
lady
herself
,
you
know
,
squint
like
a
dragon
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
day
we
have
a
long
discourse
with
her
about
love
;
and
she
tell
us
a
saying
of
her
sister
Fitz
-
Hardinge
,
which
I
think
excellent
,
that
in
man
,
desire
beget
love
,
and
in
woman
,
love
beget
desire
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
abundance
of
our
old
crier
still
hereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
every
morning
your
woman

the
old
satin
and
taffeta

,
the
fellow
with

or
cloak

<EOS>
Our
weather
be
abominable
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
two
tolerable
day
in
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lose
money
again
at
ombre
,
with
Lord
Orkney
and
other
;
yet
,
after
all
,
this
year
I
have
lose
but
three
-
and
-
twenty
shilling
;
so
that
,
consider
card
money
,
I
be
no
loser
.
  
<EOS>
Our
Society
hath
not
yet
renew
their

<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
continue
to
do
some
good
this
winter
;
and
Lord

promise
the
Academy
for

<EOS>
I

and
while

,
Mohun

in
at
the
shoulder
to
the

help
toward
the
cake
-
house
by
the
ring
in
Hyde
Park
(
where
they

,
before

could
reach
the

;
and

in

<EOS>
I

tell
that
a
footman
of
Lord
Mohun
's
stab
the
Duke
of
Hamilton
;
and
some
say
Maccartney
do
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
Mohun
give
the
affront
,
and
yet
send
the
challenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
infinitely
concerned
for
the
poor
Duke
,
who
be
a
frank
,
honest
,
good
-
natured
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
him
very
well
,
and
I
think
he
love
me
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
the
great
mind
in
the
world
to
have
me
go
with
him
to
France
,
but
durst
not
tell
it
me
;
and
those
he
do
,
say
I
could
not
be
spare
,
which
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
remove
the
poor
Duchess
to
a
lodging
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
I
have
be
with
her
two
hour
,
and
be
just
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
so
melancholy
a
scene
;
for
indeed
all
reason
for
real
grief
belong
to
her
;
nor
be
it
possible
for
anybody
to
be
a
great
loser
in
all
regard
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
move
my
very
soul
.
 
<EOS>
the
lodging
be
inconvenient
,
and
they
would
have
remove
her
to
another
;
but
I
would
not
suffer
it
,
because
it
have
no
room
backward
,
and
she
must
have
be
torture
with
the
noise
of
the
Grub
Street
screamer
mention[e
]
her
husband
's
murder
to
her
ear
.
  
<EOS>
I

the
story
of
my
escape

in
open

bandbox
send
to
Lord
Treasurer

<EOS>
the

have
tell
a
thousand
lie
of
it
;
but
at
last
we
give
them
a
true
account
of
it
at
length
,
print
in
the
evening
;
only
I
would
not
suffer
them
to
name
me
,
have
be
so
often
name
before
,
and
tease
to
death
with
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
I
come
to
have
so
much
presence
of
mind
,
which
be
usually
not
my
talent
;
but
so
it
please
God
,
and
I
save
myself
and
him
;
for
there
be
a
bullet
apiece
.
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
tell
me
that
if
I
have
be
kill
,
the
Whigs
would
have
call
it
a
judgment
,
because
the
barrel
be
of
inkhorn
,
with
which
I
have
do
them
so
much
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pure
Grub
Street
of
it
,
full
of
lie
and
inconsistency
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
these
thing
at
all
,
and
I
wish
myself
more
and
more
among
my
willow
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
devilish
spirit
among
people
,
and
the
Ministry
must
exert
themselves

or
sink

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
put

and
it

but
my

so
I

<EOS>
I

be
as
formal
to
him
as
I
can

I
happen
to
meet
him
in

Park
.
 
<EOS>
the
rogue
fret
me
,
if
he
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
me
why
I
do
not
wait
on
the
Bishop
of
Dromore
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
I
have
not
the
honour
to
be
acquaint
with
him
,
and
would
not

<EOS>
He

proud
man

<EOS>
He

ill
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
why

<EOS>
say
he
,
"
I
think
the
bishop
,
and
you

consult
about

He

"
yes

may
help
something
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
how
curiously
he
contrive
to
vex
me
;
for
the
dog
know
that
with
half
a
word
I
could
do
more
than
all
of
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
only
do
it
from
the
pride
and
envy
of
his
own
heart
,
and
not
out
of
a
humorous
design
of
teasing
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
that
would
rather
a
service
should
not
be
do
,
than
do
by
a
private
man
,

tease

about

and
suspect
my

to
the

in
such
a
whimsical
manner
that
Dr.
Pratt
,
who
be
by
,
think
he
be
mad
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no

<EOS>
We

me
with
Lady

in

the
Earl

<EOS>
He
be
another
brother
of
the

and
be
go
to

by
a

He
tease
me
for
two
hour
in
spite
of
my
tooth
,
and
hold
my

when
I
offer

stir
;
would
have
have

engage
the

to
favour
him
against
Lord
Abercorn
,
and
to
convince
them
that
Lord
Abercorn
have
no
pretension
;
and
desire
I
would
also
convince
Lord
Abercorn
himself
so
;
and
conclude
he
be
sorry
I
be
a
great
friend
to
Abercorn
than
Hamilton

I
have
no

that

<EOS>
the
Ministers
give

leave
to

it

agree

to
a
coffee
-
house

to
see
acquaintance

whom

otherwise
not

<EOS>
the

I
dine
with
Ned
Southwell
,
by
appointment
,
in
order
to
settle
your
kingdom
,
if
my
scheme
can
be
follow
;
but
I
doubt
our
Ministry
will
be
too
tedious
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
certainly
have
a
new
Parliament
;
but
they
would
have
that
a
secret
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Parliament
here
will
be
prorogue
for
three
week

<EOS>
those
puppy
the
Dutch
will
not
yet
come
in
,
though
they
pretend
to
submit
to
the
Queen
in
everything
;
but
they
would
fain
try
first
how
our
session
begin
,
in
hope
to
embroil
us
in
the
House
of
Lords
:
 
and
if
my
advice
have
be
take
,
the
session
should
have
begin
,
and
we
would
have
trust
the
Parliament
to
approve
the
step
already
make
toward
the
peace
,
and
have
an
Address
perhaps
from
them
to
conclude
without
the
Dutch
,
if
they
would
not
agree
.
 
<EOS>
other
be
of
my
mind
,
but
it
be
not
reckon
so
safe
,
it
seem
;
yet
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
the
peace
will
be
ready
so

and
Lord
Mansel
,
who

would
certainly
have
set

by
the
ear
,
out
of
pure
roguish
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
dine
with
Lord

there

something
of
farce
in
all
these
mourning

let

<EOS>
People

pretend
to
grieve

of
the
fine
wild

vilest
letter

and
from
the
vile
poet
in
the
world
,
who
send
it
me
as
a
bribe
to
get
him
an
employment
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
where
the
scoundrel
live
,
so
<EOS>
I
could
not
send
them
back
,
and
therefore
I
give
them
away
as
freely
as
I
get
them
,
and
have
order
my
man
never
to
let
up
the
poet
when
he
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
rogue
should
have
keep
the
wing
at
least
for
his
muse
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
his
fowl
be
a
large
capon
pheasant
,
as
fat
as
a
pullet
.
 
<EOS>
I
eat
share
of
it
to

day
with
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
We

foreigner

and
person
of
quality
be
at

<EOS>
I
be
there
to

and
as
Lord
Treasurer
come
towards
me
,
I
avoid
him
,
and
he
hunt
me
thrice
about
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
affect
never
to
take
notice
of
him
at
church
or
Court
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
it
,
for
I
have
tell
him
so
;
and
to
-
night
,
at
Lord
Masham
's
,
he
give
an
account
of
it
to
the
company
;
but
my
reason
be
,
that
people
see
me
speak
to
him
cause
a
great
deal
of
teasing
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
come
into
my
head
,
that
I
never
know
whether
MD
be
Whigs
or
Tories
,
and
I
value
our
conversation
the
more
that
it
never
turn
on
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
fancy
that
Ppt
be
a
Tory
,
and
a
violent
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
;
but
methink
<EOS>
she
look
like
one
,
and
DD
a
sort
of
a
Trimmer
.
 
<EOS>
be
I
right
?
 
<EOS>
I
give
the
Examiner
a
hint
about
this
prorogation
,
and
to
praise
the
Queen
for
her
tenderness
to
the
Dutch
in
give
them
still
more
time
to
submit
.

to
us
with
the
same
story
.
<EOS>
We
be
full
of
speculation
upon
it

but
I
believe
it
be
the
carelessness
of
his
french
rascally
servant

<EOS>
when
we

I
find
a

<EOS>
I
chid
him
for

but
he
whisper
me
<EOS>
it

otherwise
;
and
in
the
coach
he
tell
me
he
have
not
one
farthing

therefore
take
the
coach
for
the
whole
day
,

intend
to
borrow

(
I

<EOS>
whether
that
be
Dr.
Parnell

and
come
up

kindness
,
and
invite
him

I
value

<EOS>
She
desire
nothing

that
I
would
get
Lord

to
give
him
a
living
;
but
I
will
send
her
no

,
though
she
desire
it
much
.
 
<EOS>
She
still
make
mantuas
at

<EOS>
It
rain
all
this

,
and
dilly
come
to
me
,
and
be
coach
it
into
the
city
;
so
I
go
with
him
for
a
shaking
,
because
it
would
not
cost
me
a
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
meet
my
friend
Stratford
,
the
merchant
,
who
be
go
abroad
to
gather
up
his
debt
,
and
be
clear
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
beg
that
I
would
dine
with
some
merchant
friend
of
our
there
,
because
it
be
the
last
time
I
should
see
him
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
do
,
and
think
to
have
see
Lord
Treasurer
in
the
evening
,
but
he
happen
to
go
out
at
five
;
so
I
visit
some
friend
,
and
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
have
the
great
part
of
your
letter
to
answer
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
will
not
do
it
to

night
,
say
what
oo
please
.
 
<EOS>
the
Parliament
meet
to
-
morrow
,
but
will
be
prorogue
for
a
fortnight
;
which
disappointment
will
,
I
believe
,
vex
abundance
of
them
,
though
they
be
not
Whigs
;
for
they
be
force
to
be
in
town
at
expense
for
nothing
:
but
we
want
an
answer
from
Spain
,
before
we
be
sure
of
everything
be
right
for
the
peace
;
and
God
know
whether
we
can
have
that
answer
this
month
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
most
ticklish
juncture
of
affair
;
we

be
prorogue

as
I

and
I
find
some
cloudy
face
,
and
hear
some
grumbling
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
get
over
all
our
difficulty
with
France
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
now
settle
all
the
article
of
commerce
between
us
and
them
,
wherein
they
be
very
much
disposed
to
play
the
rogue
if
we
have
not
hold
them
to
[
it
]
;
and
this
business
we
wait
from
Spain
be
to
prevent
some
other
roguery
of
the
French
,
who
be
find
an
evasion
to
trade
to
the
Spanish
West
Indies
;
but
I
hope
we
shall
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
Lord
Treasurer

and
he
be
in
good
humour
enough
.
 
<EOS>

come

day

He

he

the

for

yet
the

for
I
always

,
and
come
naked
into
a
new
lodging
;
and
so
on
.

She

I
have
no
personal
credit

any
of
the
Commissioners

<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
Keatley
;
but
I
believe
it
will
signify
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
Customs
people
must
rise
by
degree
,
and
he
must
at
first
take
what
be
very
low
,
if
he

.

Ppt
mistake

<EOS>
some

then
I
serve
those
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
but
people
will
not
distinguish
,
but
take
thing
ill
,
when
I
have
no
power
;
but
Ppt
be
wise
.
 
<EOS>
and
employment
in

be
very

I
shall
be
more
careful
in

physic
than
Mrs.
Price

'
tis
<EOS>
not
a
farthing
matter
her

if
the

<EOS>
I
speak
to
all
the
Ministers
yesterday
about

but
they
say
the
Queen
be
angry

and
think
it
be
a
trick
to
deceive
her
;
and
she
be
positive
,
and
so
the
man
must
be
ruin
,
for
I
can
not
help
him

I
never
see
him
in
my

but
the

I
could
not
forbear
interposing

<EOS>
Your
government
recommend
him
to
the
Duke

and
he
think
they
would
grant

by
the

the

rigour
be
forfeit

so
I
believe

I
have
yours

no

,
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Your
new
Bishop
act
very
ungratefully
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
so
bad
of
it
as
he
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
at
the
same
post
<EOS>
his
warrant
and
mine
go
over
,
that
he
would
leave
those
living
to
my
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
write
this
post
to
him
to
let
him
know
how
ill
I
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
letter
to
tell
me
that
I
ought
to
think
of
employ
some
body
to
set
the
tithe
of
the
deanery
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
do
at
this
distance
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
in
Ireland
under
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
two
order
;
one
to
Parvisol
,
and
t'other
to
Parvisol
,
and
a
blank
for
whatever
fellow
it
be
whom
the
last
Dean
employ
;
and
I
would
desire
you
to
advise
with
friend
which
to
make
use
of

<EOS>
if
the
latter

let
the

<EOS>
if
the
former

then
speak
to
Parvisol
,
and
know
whether
he
can
undertake
it

<EOS>
I
doubt
it
be
hardly
to
be
do
by
a
perfect
stranger
alone
,
as
Parvisol
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
perhaps
venture
at
all
,
to
keep
up
his
interest
with
me
;
but
that
be
needless
,
for
I
be
willing

do
him
any
good

that
will
do
me
no
harm
