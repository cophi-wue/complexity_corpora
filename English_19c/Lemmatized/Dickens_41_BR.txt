in
the

1775
,
there
stand
upon
the
border
of
Epping
Forest
,
at
a
distance
of
about
twelve
mile
from
London
---
measure
from
the
Standard
in
Cornhill
,
"
or
rather
from
the
spot
on
or
near
to
which
the
Standard
use
to
be
in
day
of
yore
---
a
house
of
public
entertainment
call
the
Maypole
;
which
fact
be
demonstrate
to
all
such
traveller
as
could
neither
read
nor
write
(
and
at
that
time
a
vast
number
both
of
traveller
and
stay
-
at
-
home
be
in
this
condition
)
by
the
emblem
rear
on
the
roadside
over
against
the
house
,
which
,
if
not
of
those
goodly
proportion
that
maypole
be
will
not
to
present
in
olden
time
,
be
a
fair
young
ash
,
thirty
foot
in
height
,
and
straight
as
any
arrow
that
ever
English
yeoman
draw
.
  
<EOS>
the
Maypole
---
by
which
term
from
henceforth
be
mean
the
house
,
and
not
its
sign
---
the
Maypole
be
an
old
building
,
with
more
gable
end
than
a
lazy
man
would
care
to
count
on
a
sunny
day
;
huge
zig
-
zag
chimney
,
out
of
which
it
seem
as
though
even
smoke
could
not
choose
but
come
in
more
than
naturally
fantastic
shape
,
impart
to
it
in
its
tortuous
progress
;
and
vast
stable
,
gloomy
,
ruinous
,
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
be
say
to
have
be
build
in
the
day
of
King
Henry
the
Eighth
;
and
there
be
a
legend
,
not
only
that
Queen
Elizabeth
have
sleep
there
one
night
while
upon
a
hunting
excursion
,
to
wit
,
in
a
certain
oak
-
panel
room
with
a
deep
bay
window
,
but
that
next
morning
,
while
stand
on
a
mount
block
before
the
door
with
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
the
virgin
monarch
have
then
and
there
box
and
cuff
an
unlucky
page
for
some
neglect
of
duty
.
<EOS>
the
matter
-
of
-
fact
and
doubtful
folk
,
of
whom
there
be
a
few
among
the
Maypole
customer
,
as
unluckily
there
always
be
in
every
little
community
,
be
incline
to
look
upon
this
tradition
as
rather
apocryphal
;
but
,
whenever
the
landlord
of
that
ancient
hostelry
appeal
to
the
mount
block
itself
as
evidence
,
and
triumphantly
point
out
that
there
it
stand
in
the
same
place
to
that
very
day
,
the
doubter
never
fail
to
be
put
down
by
a
large
majority
,
and
all
true
believer
exult
as
in
a
victory
.
  
<EOS>
whether
these
,
and
many
other
story
of
the
like
nature
,
be
true
or
untrue
,
the
Maypole
be
really
an
old
house
,
a
very
old
house
,
perhaps
as
old
as
it
claim
to
be
,
and
perhaps
old
,
which
will
sometimes
happen
with
house
of
an
uncertain
,
as
with
lady
of
a
certain
,
age
.
 
<EOS>
Its
window
be
old
diamond
-
pane
lattice
,
its
floor
be
sink
and
uneven
,
its
ceiling
blacken
by
the
hand
of
time
,
and
heavy
with
massive
beam
.
 
<EOS>
over
the
doorway
be
an
ancient
porch
,
quaintly
and
grotesquely
carve
;
and
here
on
summer
evening
the
more
favoured
customer
smoke
and
drank
---
ay
,
and
sing
many
a
good
song
too
,
sometimes
---
repose
on
two
grim
-
look
high
-
back
settle
,
which
,
like
the
twin
dragon
of
some
fairy
tale
,
guard
the
entrance
to
the
mansion
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
chimney
of
the
disuse
room
,
swallow
have
build
their
nest
for
many
a
long
year
,
and
from
early
spring
to
late
autumn
whole
colony
of
sparrow
chirp
and
twitter
in
the
eave
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
more
pigeon
about
the
dreary
stable
-
yard
and
out
-
building
than
anybody
but
the
landlord
could
reckon
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
wheeling
and
circle
flight
of
runt
,
fantail
,
tumbler
,
and
pouter
,
be
perhaps
not
quite
consistent
with
the
grave
and
sober
character
of
the
building
,
but
the
monotonous
cooing
,
which
never
cease
to
be
raise
by
some
among
them
all
day
long
,
suit
it
exactly
,
and
seem
to
lull
it
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
with
its
overhanging
story
,
drowsy
little
pane
of
glass
,
and
front
bulge
out
and
project
over
the
pathway
,
the
old
house
look
as
if
it
be
nod
in
its
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
need
no
very
great
stretch
of
fancy
to
detect
in
it
other
resemblance
to
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
the
brick
of
which
it
be
build
have
originally
be
a
deep
dark
red
,
but
have
grow
yellow
and
discolour
like
an
old
man
's
skin
;
the
sturdy
timber
have
decay
like
tooth
;
and
here
<EOS>
and
there
the
ivy
,
like
a
warm
garment
to
comfort
it
in
its
age
,
wrapt
its
green
leave
closely
round
the
time
-
wear
wall
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
hale
and
hearty
age
though
,
still
:
and
in
the
summer
or
autumn
evening
,
when
the
glow
of
the
set
sun
fall
upon
the
oak
and
chestnut
tree
of
the
adjacent
forest
,
the
old
house
,
partaking
of
its
lustre
,
seem
their
fit
companion
,
and
to
have
many
good
year
of
life
in
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
with
which
we
have
to
do
,
be
neither
a
summer
nor
an
autumn
one
,
but
the
twilight
of
a
day
in
March
,
when
the
wind
howl
dismally
among
the
bare
branch
of
the
tree
,
and
rumble
in
the
wide
chimney
and
drive
the
rain
against
the
window
of
the
Maypole
Inn
,
give
such
of
its
frequenter
as
chance
to
be
there
at
the
moment
an
undeniable
reason
for
prolong
their
stay
,
and
cause
the
landlord
to
prophesy
that
the
night
would
certainly
clear
at
eleven
o'clock
precisely
,
---
which
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
be
the
hour
at
which
he
always
close
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
name
of
him
upon
whom
the
spirit
of
prophecy
thus
descend
be
John
Willet
,
a
burly
,
large
-
headed
man
with
a
fat
face
,
which
betoken
profound
obstinacy
and
slowness
of
apprehension
,
combine
with
a
very
strong
reliance
upon
his
own
merit
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
John
Willet
's
ordinary
boast
in
his
more
placid
mood
that
if
he
be
slow
he
be
sure
;
which
assertion
could
,
in
one
sense
at
least
,
be
by
no
means
gainsaid
,
see
that
he
be
in
everything
unquestionably
the
reverse
of
fast
,
and
withal
one
of
the
most
dogged
and
positive
fellow
in
existence
---
<EOS>
always
sure
that
what
he
think
or
say
or
do
be
right
,
and
hold
it
as
a
thing
quite
settle
and
ordain
by
the
law
of
nature
and
Providence
,
that
anybody
who
say
or
do
or
think
otherwise
must
be
inevitably
and
of
necessity
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
walk
slowly
up
to
the
window
,
flatten
his
fat
nose
against
the
cold
glass
,
and
shade
his
eye
that
his
sight
may
not
be
affect
by
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
fire
,
look
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
walk
slowly
back
to
his
old
seat
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
and
,
compose
himself
in
it
with
a
slight
shiver
,
such
as
a
man
may
give
way
to
<EOS>
and
so
acquire
an
additional
relish
for
the
warm
blaze
,
say
,
look
round
upon
his
guest
:
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
clear
at
eleven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
no
sooner
and
no
later
.
 
<EOS>
not
before
and
not
arterward
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
make
out
that
?
"
say
a
little
man
in
the
opposite
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
moon
be
past
the
full
,
and
she
rise
at
nine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
look
sedately
and
solemnly
at
his
questioner
until
he
have
bring
his
mind
to
bear
upon
the
whole
of
his
observation
,
and
then
make
answer
,
in
a
tone
which
seem
to
imply
that
the
moon
be
peculiarly
his
business
and
nobody
else
's
:
  
<EOS>
"
never
you
mind
about
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
trouble
yourself
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
let
the
moon
alone
,
and
I
will
let
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
offence
I
hope
?
"
say
the
little
man
.
  
<EOS>
again
John
wait
leisurely
until
the
observation
have
thoroughly
penetrate
to
his
brain
,
and
then
reply
,
"
no
offence
as
yet
,
"
apply
a
light
to
his
pipe
and
smoke
in
placid
silence
;
now
and
then
cast
a
sidelong
look
at
a
man
wrap
in
a
loose
riding
-
coat
with
huge
cuff
ornament
with
tarnished
silver
lace
and
large
metal
button
,
who
sit
apart
from
the
regular
frequenter
of
the
house
,
and
wear
a
hat
flap
over
his
face
,
which
be
still
further
shade
by
the
hand
on
which
his
forehead
rest
,
look
unsociable
enough
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
another
guest
,
who
sit
,
boot
and
spur
,
at
some
distance
from
the
fire
also
,
and
whose
thought
---
to
judge
from
his
fold
arm
and
knit
brow
,
and
from
the
untasted
liquor
before
him
---
be
occupy
with
other
matter
than
the
topic
under
discussion
or
the
person
who
discuss
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
young
man
of
about
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
rather
above
the
middle
height
,
and
though
of
somewhat
slight
figure
,
gracefully
and
strongly
make
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
his
own
dark
hair
,
and
be
accoutre
in
a
ride
dress
,
which
together
with
his
large
boot
(
resemble
in
shape
and
fashion
those
wear
by
our
Life
Guardsmen
at
the
present
day
)
,
show
indisputable
trace
of
the
bad
condition
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
but
travel
-
stain
though
he
be
<EOS>
,
he
be
well
and
even
richly
attired
,
and
without
be
overdress
look
a
gallant
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
lie
upon
the
table
beside
him
,
as
he
have
carelessly
throw
them
down
,
be
a
heavy
riding
-
whip
and
a
slouched
hat
,
the
latter
wear
no
doubt
as
be
best
suited
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
there
,
too
,
be
a
pair
of
pistol
in
a
holster
-
case
,
and
a
short
riding
-
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
little
of
his
face
be
visible
,
except
the
long
dark
lash
which
conceal
his
downcast
eye
,
but
an
air
of
careless
ease
and
natural
gracefulness
of
demeanour
pervade
the
figure
,
and
seem
to
comprehend
even
those
slight
accessory
,
which
be
all
handsome
,
and
in
good
keeping
.
  
<EOS>
towards
this
young
gentleman
the
eye
of
Mr
Willet
wander
but
once
,
and
then
as
if
in
mute
inquiry
whether
he
have
observe
his
silent
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
John
and
the
young
gentleman
have
often
meet
before
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
his
look
be
not
return
,
or
indeed
observe
by
the
person
to
whom
it
be
address
,
John
gradually
concentrate
the
whole
power
of
his
eye
into
one
focus
,
and
bring
it
to
bear
upon
the
man
in
the
flap
hat
,
at
whom
he
come
to
stare
in
course
of
time
with
an
intensity
so
remarkable
,
that
it
affect
his
fireside
crony
,
who
all
,
as
with
one
accord
,
take
their
pipe
from
their
lip
,
and
stare
with
open
mouth
at
the
stranger
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
the
sturdy
landlord
have
a
large
pair
of
dull
fish
-
like
eye
,
and
the
little
man
who
have
hazard
the
remark
about
the
moon
(
and
who
be
the
parish
-
clerk
and
bell
-
ringer
of
Chigwell
,
a
village
hard
by
)
have
little
round
black
shiny
eye
like
bead
;
moreover
this
little
man
wear
at
the
knee
of
his
rusty
black
breech
,
and
on
his
rusty
black
coat
,
and
all
down
his
long
flap
waistcoat
,
little
queer
button
like
nothing
except
his
eye
;
<EOS>
but
so
like
them
,
that
as
they
twinkle
and
glisten
in
the
light
of
the
fire
,
which
shine
too
in
his
bright
shoe
-
buckle
,
he
seem
all
eye
from
head
to
foot
,
and
to
be
gaze
with
every
one
of
them
at
the
unknown
customer
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
a
man
should
grow
restless
under
such
an
inspection
as
this
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
eye
belong
to
short
Tom
Cobb
the
general
chandler
and
post
-
office
keeper
,
and
long
Phil
Parkes
the
ranger
,
both
of
whom
,
infect
by
the
example
of
their
companion
,
regard
him
of
the
flap
hat
no
less
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
the
stranger
become
restless
;
perhaps
from
be
expose
to
this
rake
fire
of
eye
,
perhaps
from
the
nature
of
his
previous
meditation
---
most
probably
from
the
latter
cause
,
for
as
he
change
his
position
and
look
hastily
round
,
he
start
to
find
himself
the
object
of
such
keen
regard
,
and
dart
an
angry
and
suspicious
glance
at
the
fireside
group
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
the
effect
of
immediately
divert
all
eye
to
the
chimney
,
except
those
of
John
Willet
,
who
find
himself
as
it
be
,
catch
in
the
fact
,
and
not
be
(
as
have
be
already
observe
)
of
a
very
ready
nature
,
remain
stare
at
his
guest
in
a
particularly
awkward
and
disconcert
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
say
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
well
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
in
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
long
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
give
an
order
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
after
a
pause
of
two
or
three
minute
for
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
the
stranger
take
off
his
hat
,
and
disclose
the
hard
feature
of
a
man
of
sixty
or
thereabout
,
much
weatherbeaten
and
wear
by
time
,
and
the
naturally
harsh
expression
of
which
be
not
improve
by
a
dark
handkerchief
which
be
bind
tightly
round
his
head
,
and
,
while
it
serve
the
purpose
of
a
wig
,
shade
his
forehead
,
and
almost
hide
his
eyebrow
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
intend
to
conceal
or
divert
attention
from
a
deep
gash
,
now
heal
into
an
ugly
seam
,
which
when
it
be
first
inflict
must
have
lay
bare
his
cheekbone
,
the
object
be
but
indifferently
attain
,
<EOS>
for
it
could
scarcely
fail
to
be
note
at
a
glance
.
 
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
of
a
cadaverous
hue
,
and
he
have
a
grizzly
jag
beard
of
some
three
week
'
date
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
figure
(
very
meanly
and
poorly
clothe
)
that
now
rise
from
the
seat
,
and
stalk
across
the
room
sit
down
in
a
corner
of
the
chimney
,
which
the
politeness
or
fear
of
the
little
clerk
very
readily
assign
to
him

bind

"
if
it
be
godly
and
righteous
for
boy

be
of
the
age

behave
themselves

then
the

the

<EOS>
"
very
good
,

Mr

accord
to
the
constitution

so
much
of

an

have
long
be
poorly
,
deceased

order
come
to
me
at
half
after
twelve
o'clock
at
night
to
go
and
toll
the
passing
-
bell
.

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
movement
in
the
little
group
of
listener
,
sufficiently
indicative
of
the
strong
repugnance
any
one
of
them
would
have
feel
to
have
turn
out
at
such
a
time
upon
such
an
errand

the
clerk
feel
and
understand
it
,

pursue
his
theme
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
dreary
thing
,
especially
as
the
grave
-
digger
be
lay
up
in
his
bed
,
from
long
work
in
a
damp
soil
and
sit
down
to
take
his
dinner
on
cold
tombstone
,
and
I
be
consequently
under
obligation
to
go
alone
,
for
it
be
too
late
to
hope
to
get
any
other
companion
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
not
unprepared
for
it
;
as
the
old
gentleman
have
often
make
it
a
request
that
the
bell
should
be
toll
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
breath
be
out
of
his
body
,
and
he
have
be
expect
to
go
for
some
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
as
good
a
face
upon
it
as
I
could
,
and
muffle
myself
up
(
for
it
be
mortal
cold
)
,
start
out
with
a
light
lantern
in
one
hand
and
the
key
of
the
church
in
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
point
of
the
narrative
,
the
dress
of
the
strange
man
rustle
as
if
he
have
turn
himself
to
hear
more
distinctly
.
<EOS>
slightly
point
over
his
shoulder
,
Solomon
elevate
his
eyebrow
and
nod
a
silent
inquiry
to
Joe
whether
this
be
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
shade
his
eye
with
his
hand
and
peer
into
the
corner
,
but
could
make
out
nothing
,
and
so
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
such
a
night
as
this
;
blow
a
hurricane
,
rain
heavily
,
and
very
dark
---
I
often
think
now
,
dark
than
I
ever
see
it
before
or
since
;
that
may
be
my
fancy
,
but
the
house
be
all
close
shut
and
the
folk
in
door
,
and
perhaps
there
be
only
one
other
man
who
know
how
dark
it
really
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
into
the
church
,
chain
the
door
back
so
that
it
should
keep
ajar
---
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
like
to
be
shut
in
there
alone
---
and
put
my
lantern
on
the
stone
seat
in
the
little
corner
where
the
bell
-
rope
be
,
sit
down
beside
it
to
trim
the
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
sit
down
to
trim
the
candle
,
and
when
I
have
do
<EOS>
so
I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
get
up
again
,
and
go
about
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
<EOS>
I
think
of
all
the
ghost
story
I
have
ever
hear
,
even
those
that
I
have
hear
when
I
be
a
boy
at
school
,
and
have
forget
long
ago
;
and
they
do
not
come
into
my
mind
one
after
another
,
but
all
crowd
at
once
,
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
one
story
there
be
in
the
village
,
how
that
on
a
certain
night
in
the
year
(
it
may
be
that
very
night
for
anything
I
know
)
<EOS>
,
all
the
dead
people
come
out
of
the
ground
and
sit
at
the
head
of
their
own
grave
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
me
think
how
many
people
I
have
know
,
be
bury
between
the
church
-
door
and
the
churchyard
gate
,
and
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
to
have
to
pass
among
them
and
know
them
again
,
so
earthy
and
unlike
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
all
the
niche
and
arch
in
the
church
from
a
child
;
still
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
that
those
be
their
natural
shadow
which
I
see
on
the
pavement
,
but
feel
sure
there
be
some
ugly
figure
hide
among
'em
and
peep
out
.
 
<EOS>
think
on
in
this
way
,
I
begin
to
think
of
the
old
gentleman
who
be
just
dead
,
and
I
could
have
swear
,
as
I
look
up
the
dark
chancel
,
that
I
see
him
in
his
usual
place
,
wrap
his
shroud
about
him
and
shiver
as
if
he
feel
it
cold
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
I
sit
listen
and
listen
,
and
hardly
dare
to
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
start
up
and
take
the
bell
-
rope
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
minute
there
rang
---
not
that
bell
,
<EOS>
for
I
have
hardly
touch
the
rope
---
but
another
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
the
ringing
of
another
bell
,
and
a
deep
bell
too
,
plainly
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
for
an
instant
,
and
even
then
the
wind
carry
the
sound
away
,
but
I
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
listen
for
a
long
time
,
but
it
ring
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
corpse
candle
,
and
at
last
I
persuade
myself
that
this
must
be
a
corpse
bell
tolling
of
itself
at
midnight
for
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
toll
my
bell
---
<EOS>
how
,
or
how
long
,
I
do
not
know

and
run
home
to
bed
as
fast
as
I
could
touch
the
ground

be
up
early

what

at

It

surely
you

ask
such

question
in

I

for
on

point

in

<EOS>
the
guest
then
wrap
his
garment
about
him
so
as
to
shelter
himself
as
effectually
as
he
could

rough
weather

without

to

"
I

He

<EOS>
"
the

worth

master

who

mount
on

jaded

it
on

a

both

<EOS>
so
say
he
shake
his
hand
from
the
bridle
,
strike
him
roughly
on
the
head
with
the
butt
end
of
his
whip

and
gallop
away
;
dash
through
the
mud

the

still

that

some

Gabriel
resume

murmur
in
a
half
whisper
:

The

two
mile

<EOS>
I
come
the

It
would
be
dangerous
to
go
on

it
be
four
mile
,

a
good
half
mile
besides

to

House

between

repeat
these
two
last
word
very
often

as
if
to
compensate
for
the
little
resolution
he
be
go
to
show
by
pique
himself
on
the
great
resolution
he
have
show
,
Gabriel

quietly
turn
back
,
determine
to
get
a
light
at
the
Maypole
,
and
to
take
nothing
but
a
light
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
get
to
the
Maypole
,
however
,
and
Joe
,
respond
to
his
well

know
hail
,
come
run
out
to
the
horse
's
head
,
leave
the
door
open
behind
him
,
and
disclose
a
delicious
perspective
of
warmth
and
brightness
---
when
the
ruddy
gleam
of
the
fire
,
stream
through
the
old
red
curtain
of
the
common
room
,
seem
to
bring
with
it
,
as
part
of
itself
,
a
pleasant
hum
of
voice
,
and
a
fragrant
odour
of
steam
grog
and
rare
tobacco
,
all
steep
as
it
be
in
the
cheerful
glow
---
when
the
shadow
,
flit
across
the
curtain
,
show
that
those
inside
have
rise
from
their
snug
seat
,
and
be
make
room
in
the
snug
corner
(
how
well
he
know
that
corner
!
)
<EOS>
for
the
honest
locksmith
,
and
a
broad
glare
,
suddenly
stream
up
,
bespoke
the
goodness
of
the
crackle
log
from
which
a
brilliant
train
of
spark
be
doubtless
at
that
moment
whirl
up
the
chimney
in
honour
of
his
coming
---
when
,
superadde
to
these
enticement
,
there
steal
upon
him
from
the
distant
kitchen
a
gentle
sound
of
fry
,
with
a
musical
clatter
of
plate
and
dish
,
and
a
savoury
smell
that
make
even
the
boisterous
wind
<EOS>
a
perfume
<EOS>
---
Gabriel
feel
his
firmness
ooze
rapidly
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
look
stoically
at
the
tavern
,
but
his
feature
would
relax
into
a
look
of
fondness
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
his
head
the
other
way
,
and
the
cold
black
country
seem
to
frown
him
off
,
and
drive
him
for
a
refuge
into
its
hospitable
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
the

Joe

say
the

<EOS>
I
will
get
out
for
a
little
while

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
how
natural
it
be
to
get
out
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
unnatural
it
seem
for
a
sober
man
to
be
plod
wearily
along
through
miry
road
,
encounter
the
rude
buffet
of
the
wind
and
pelting
of
the
rain
,
when
there
be
a
clean
floor
cover
with
crisp
white
sand

a

a

<EOS>
such
be
the
locksmith
's
thought
when
first
seat
in
the
snug
corner
,
and
slowly
recover
from
a
pleasant
defect
of
vision
---
 
<EOS>
pleasant
,
because
occasion
by
the
wind
blow
in
his
eye
---
which
make
it
a
matter
of
sound
policy
and
duty
to
himself
,
that
he
should
take
refuge
from
the
weather
,
and
tempt
him
,
for
the
same
reason
,
to
aggravate
a
slight
cough
,
and
declare
he
feel
but
poorly
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
still
his
thought
more
than
a
full
hour
afterwards
,
when
,
supper
over

he
still
sit
with
shine
jovial
face
in
the
same
warm
nook
,
listen
to
the
cricket
-
like
chirrup
of
little
Solomon
Daisy
,
and
bear
no
unimportant
or
slightly
respected
part
in
the
social
gossip
round
the
Maypole
fire
.

"
I

up
a
variety
of
speculation
relative
to
the
stranger

concern
whom
Gabriel
have
compare
note
with
the
company

so
raise
a
grave
discussion
;

It

be

<EOS>
"
why
who
should
I
tell
it
to

return
Gabriel

<EOS>
"
They
know
it
here

I
be
not
likely
to
come
across
anybody
else

would
care
about
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
that

true
enough

I
quite
forget

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
raise
his
face
,
which
be
very
red
,
---
no
doubt
from
the
exertion
of
strap
and
buckle
as
aforesaid

give
the
rein
to
the
old
man

who
have
by
this

take
his
seat

sigh
again

bade
him
good

now
think

not

there

a
good

I
have
an

<EOS>
return
his
cheery
farewell
with
cordial
goodwill
,
Joe
Willet
linger
until
the
sound
of
wheel
cease
to
vibrate
in
his
ear
,
and
then
,
shake
his
head
mournfully
,
re
-
enter
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
Varden
go
his
way
towards
London
,
think
of
a
great
many
thing
,
and
most
of
all
of
flame
term
in
which
to
relate
his
adventure
,
and
so
account
satisfactorily
to
Mrs
Varden
for
visit
the
Maypole
,
despite
certain
solemn
covenant
between
himself
and
that
lady
.
 
<EOS>
think
beget
,
not
only
think
,
but
drowsiness
occasionally
,
and
the
more
the
locksmith
thought
,
the
more
sleepy
he
become
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
may
be
very
sober
---
or
at
least
firmly
set
upon
his
leg
on
that
neutral
ground
which
lie
between
the
confine
of
perfect
sobriety
and
slight
tipsiness
---
and
yet
feel
a
strong
tendency
to
mingle
up
present
circumstance
with
other
which
have
no
manner
of
connection
with
them
;
to
confound
all
consideration
of
person
,
thing
,
time
,
and
place
;
and
to
jumble
his
disjoint
thought
together
in
a
kind
of
mental
kaleidoscope
,
produce
combination
as
unexpected
as
they
be
transitory
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
Gabriel
Varden
's
state
,
as
,
nod
in
his
dog
sleep
,
and
leave
his
horse
to
pursue
a
road
with
which
he
be
well
acquainted
,
he
get
over
the
ground
unconsciously
,
and
draw
near
and
near
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
rouse
himself
once
,
when
the
horse
stop
until
the
turnpike
gate
be
open
,
and
have
cry
a
lusty
"
good
night
!
"
<EOS>
to
the
toll
-
keeper
;
but
then
he
awake
out
of
a
dream
about
pick
a
lock
in
the
stomach
of
the
Great
Mogul
,
and
even
when
he
do
wake
,
mix
up
the
turnpike
man
with
his
mother
-
in
-
law
who
have
be
dead
twenty
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
surprising
,
therefore
,
that
he
soon
relapse
,
and
jog
heavily
along
,
quite
insensible
to
his
progress
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
now
,
he
approach
the
great
city
,
which
lie
outstretche
before
him
like
a
dark
shadow
on
the
ground
,
redden
the
sluggish
air
with
a
deep
dull
light
,
<EOS>
that
tell
of
labyrinth
of
public
way
and
shop
,
and
swarm
of
busy
people
.
 
<EOS>
approach
nearer
and
nearer
yet
,
this
halo
begin
to
fade
,
and
the
cause
which
produce
it
slowly
to
develop
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
long
line
of
poorly
light
street
may
be
faintly
trace
,
with
here
and
there
a
light
spot
,
where
lamp
be
cluster
round
a
square
or
market
,
or
round
some
great
building
;
after
a
time
these
grow
more
distinct
,
and
the
lamp
themselves
be
visible
;
slight
yellow
speck
,
that
seem
to
be
rapidly
snuff
out
,
one
by
one
,
as
intervene
obstacle
hide
them
from
the
sight
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
sound
arise
---
the
striking
of
church
clock
,
the
distant
bark
of
dog
,
the
hum
of
traffic
in
the
street
;
then
outlines
may
be
trace
---
tall
steeple
loom
in
the
air
,
and
pile
of
unequal
roof
oppress
by
chimney
;
then
,
the
noise
swell
into
a
loud
sound
,
and
form
grow
more
distinct
and
numerous
still
,
and
London
---
visible
in
the
darkness
by
its
own
faint
light
,
and
not
by
that
of
Heaven
---
be
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
locksmith
,
however
,
all
unconscious
of
its
near
vicinity
,
still
jog
on
,
half
sleeping
and
half
waking
,
when
a
loud
cry
at
no
great
distance
ahead
,
rouse
him
with
a
start
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
moment
or
two
he
look
about
him
like
a
man
who
have
be
transport
to
some
strange
country
in
his
sleep
,
but
soon
recognise
familiar
object
,
rub
his
eye
lazily
and
may
have
relapse
again
,
but
that
the
cry
be
repeat
---
not
once
or
twice
or
thrice
,
but
many
time
,
and
each
time
,
if
possible
,
with
increase
vehemence
.
 
<EOS>
thoroughly
arouse
,
Gabriel
,
who
be
a
bold
man
and
not
easily
daunt
,
make
straight
to
the
spot
,
urge
on
his
stout
little
horse
as
if
for
life
or
death
.
  
<EOS>
the
matter
indeed
look
sufficiently
serious
,
for
,
come
to
the
place
<EOS>
whence
the
cry
have
proceed
<EOS>
,
he
descry
the
figure
of
a
man
extend
in
an
apparently
lifeless
state
upon
the
pathway
,
and
,
hover
round
him
,
another
person
with
a
torch
in
his
hand
,
which
he
wave
in
the
air
with
a
wild
impatience
,
redouble
meanwhile
those
cry
for
help
which
have
bring
the
locksmith
to
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
here
to
do
?
"
say
the
old
man
,
alighting
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
this
---
 
<EOS>
what
---
Barnaby
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
bearer
of
the
torch
shake
his
long
loose
hair
back
from
his
eye
,
and
thrust
his
face
eagerly
into
that
of
the
locksmith
,
fix
upon
him
a
look
which
tell
his
history
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
,
Barnaby
?
"
say
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
He
nod
---
not
once
or
twice
,
but
a
score
of
time
,
and
that
with
a
fantastic
exaggeration
which
would
have
keep
his
head
in
motion
for
an
hour
,
but
that
the
locksmith
hold
up
his
finger
,
and
fix
his
eye
sternly
upon
him
cause
him
to
desist
;
then
point
to
the
body
with
an
inquiring
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
blood
upon
him
,
"
say
Barnaby
with
a
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
make
me
sick
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
come
it
there
?
"
demand
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
"
steel
,
steel
,
steel
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
fiercely
,
imitate
with
his
hand
the
thrust
of
a
sword
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
rob
?
"
say
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
catch
him
by
the
arm
,
and
nod
"
yes
;
"
then
point
towards
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
the
old
man
,
bend
over
the
body
and
look
round
as
he
speak
into
Barnaby
's
pale
face
,
strangely
light
up
by
something
that
be
not
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
robber
make
off
that
way
,
do
he
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
never
mind
that
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
hold
your
torch
this
way
---
a
little
farther
off
---
<EOS>
so
.
 
<EOS>
now
stand
quiet
,
while
I
try
to
see
what
harm
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
he
apply
himself
to
a
close
examination
of
the
prostrate
form
,
while
Barnaby
,
hold
the
torch
as
he
have
be
direct
,
look
on
in
silence
,
fascinate
by
interest
or
curiosity
,
but
repel
nevertheless
by
some
strong
and
secret
horror
which
convulse
him
in
every
nerve
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
stand
,
at
that
moment
,
half
shrink
back
and
half
bend
forward
,
both
his
face
and
figure
be
full
in
the
strong
glare
of
the
link
,
and
as
distinctly
reveal
as
though
it
have
be
broad
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
about
three
-
and
-
twenty
year
old
,
and
though
rather
spare
,
of
a
fair
height
and
strong
make
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
,
of
which
he
have
a
great
profusion
,
be
red
,
and
hang
in
disorder
about
his
face
and
shoulder
,
give
to
his
restless
look
an
expression
quite
unearthly
---
enhance
by
the
paleness
of
his
complexion
,
and
the
glassy
lustre
of
his
large
protrude
eye
.
 
<EOS>
startle
as
his
aspect
be
,
the
feature
be
good
,
and
there
be
something
even
plaintive
in
his
wan
and
haggard
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
the
absence
of
the
soul
be
far
more
terrible
in
a
live
man
than
in
a
dead
one
;
and
in
this
unfortunate
be
its
noblest
power
be
want
.
  
<EOS>
His
dress
be
of
green
,
clumsily
trim
here
and
there
---
apparently
by
his
own
hand
---
with
gaudy
lace
;
bright
where
the
cloth
be
most
worn
and
soil
,
and
poor
where
it
be
at
the
good
.
 
<EOS>
a
pair
of
tawdry
ruffle
dangle
at
his
wrist
,
while
his
throat
be
nearly
bare
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
ornament
his
hat
with
a
cluster
of
peacock
's
feather
,
but
they
be
limp
and
broken
,
and
now
trail
negligently
down
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
Girt
to
his
side
be
the
steel
hilt
of
an
old
sword
without
blade
or
scabbard
;
and
some
particoloure
end
of
riband
and
poor
glass
toy
complete
the
ornamental
portion
of
his
attire
.
 
<EOS>
the
fluttered
and
confused
disposition
of
all
the
motley
scrap
that
form
his
dress
,
bespoke
,
in
a
scarcely
less
degree
than
his
eager
and
unsettled
manner
,
the
disorder
of
his
mind
,
and
by
a
grotesque
contrast
set
off
and
heighten
the
more
impressive
wildness
of
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Barnaby
,
"
say
the
locksmith
,
after
a
hasty
but
careful
inspection
,
"
this
man
be
not
dead
,
but
he
have
a
wound
in
his
side
,
and
be
in
a
fainting

fit

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
cry
Barnaby

clap
his

<EOS>
"

repeat
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush

"
say
Barnaby
,
lay
his
finger
upon
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
go
out
to

day
a
wooing
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
a
light
guinea
that
he
should
never
go
a
wooing
again
,
for
,
if
he
do
,
some
eye
would
grow
dim
that
be
now
as
bright
as

when
I
talk
of

the

out

be
they

if
they

why
do
they
look
down
here
and
see
good
man
hurt
,

only
wink
and
sparkle
all
the
night
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
Heaven
help
this
silly
fellow
,
"
murmur
the
perplex
locksmith
;
"
can
he
know
this
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
His
mother
's
house
be
not
far
off
;
I
have
better
see
if
she
can
tell
me
who
he
be

<EOS>
Barnaby
,
my
man
,
help
me
to
put
him
in
the
chaise
,
and
we
will
ride
home
together

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
touch
him
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
idiot
fall
back
,
and
shudder
as
with
a
strong
spasm
;
he
be
bloody
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
his
nature
,
I
know
,
"
mutter
the
locksmith
,
"
it
be
cruel
to
ask
him
,
but
I
must
have
help
.
 
<EOS>
barnaby

wrap
him
close

do

gently

<EOS>
They
place
him
in
the
carriage
with
great
ease
,
for
Barnaby
be
strong
and
active
,
but
all
the
time
they

so
occupied
he
shiver
from
head
to

and
evidently
experience
an
ecstasy
of
terror

cover
with

he
take
off

Gabriel
inwardly
congratulate

an

silence

very
little

rather
tall

he

He

never

fathom
by

concern
the

indeed
he

utterly
quell

subdue
the
haughty
beauty
by

it

that
neither

conclusive

<EOS>
It
may
be
infer
from
these
premise

that
in
the
small
body
of
Mr
Tappertit
there
be
lock
up
an
ambitious
and
aspire
soul
.
<EOS>
as
certain
liquor
,
confine
in
cask
too
cramp
in
their
dimension
,
will
ferment
,
and
fret
,
and
chafe
in
their
imprisonment
,
so
the
spiritual
essence
or
soul
of
Mr
Tappertit
would
sometimes
fume
within
that
precious
cask
,
his
body
,
until
,
with
great
foam
and
froth
and
splutter
,
it
would
force
a
vent
,
and
carry
all
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
custom
to
remark
,
in
reference
to
any
one
of
these
occasion
,
that
his
soul
have
get
into
his
head
;
and
in
this
novel
kind
of
intoxication
many
scrape
and
mishap
befell
him
,
which
he
have
frequently
conceal
with
no
small
difficulty
from
his
worthy
master
.
  
<EOS>
Sim
Tappertit
,
among
the
other
fancy
upon
which
his
before

mention
soul
be
for
ever
feast
and
regale
itself
(
and
which
fancy
,
like
the
liver
of
Prometheus
,
grow
as
they
be
feed
upon
)
,
have
a
mighty
notion
of
his
order
;
and
have
be
hear
by
the
servant
-
maid
openly
express
his
regret
that
the
'
prentice
no
longer
carry
club
wherewith
to
mace
the
citizen
:
that
be
his
strong
expression
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
report
to
have
say
that
in
former
time
a
stigma
have
be
cast
upon
the
body
by
the
execution
of
George
Barnwell
,
to
which
they
should
not
have
basely
submit
,
but
should
have
demand
him
of
the
legislature
---
 
temperately
at
first
;
then
by
an
appeal
to
arm
,
if
necessary
---
to
be
deal
with
as
they
in
their
wisdom
may
think
fit
.
 
<EOS>
these
thought
always
lead
him
to
consider
what
a
glorious
engine
the
'
prentice
may
yet
become
if
they
have
but
a
master
spirit
at
their
head
;
and
then
he
would
darkly
,
and
to
the
terror
of
his
hearer
,
hint
at
certain
reckless
fellow
that
he
know
of
,
and
at
a
certain
Lion
Heart
ready
to
become
their
captain
,
who
,
once
afoot
,
would
make
the
Lord
Mayor
tremble
on
his
throne
.
  
<EOS>
in
respect
of
dress
and
personal
decoration
,
Sim
Tappertit
be
no
less
of
an
adventurous
and
enterprising
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
see
,
beyond
dispute
,
to
pull
off
ruffle
of
the
fine
quality
at
the
corner
of
the
street
on
Sunday
night
,
and
to
put
them
carefully
in
his
pocket
before
return
home
;
and
it
be
quite
notorious
that
on
all
great
holiday
occasion
it
be
his
habit
to
exchange
his
plain
steel
knee
-
buckle
for
a
pair
of
glitter
paste
,
under
cover
of
a
friendly
post
,
plant
most
conveniently
in
that
same
spot
.
 
<EOS>
add
to
this
that
he
be
in
year
<EOS>
just
twenty
,
in
his
look
much
old
,
and
in
conceit
at
least
two
hundred
;
that
he
have
no
objection
to
be
jest
with
,
touch
his
admiration
of
his

She

pretty

It
bear
trace
of
affliction

they

any

glance
on
Barnaby
may
have
know
that
this

his

from
the
strong
resemblance

but
where
in
his
face
there
be
wildness
and
vacancy
,
<EOS>
in
her
there
be
the
patient
composure
of
long
effort

quiet
resignation

<EOS>
one
thing
about
this

very
strange
and
startling
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
not

cheerful
mood
without

terror

It

not

It
be
in

You

there

something

ever
there

<EOS>
It
be
the

shadow

some
look

to
which
an
instant
of
intense
and
most
unutterable
horror
only
could
have
give
birth
;
but
indistinct
and
feeble
as
it

it
do
suggest
what

stamp
upon

see
in

it
must
have
have
some
legend

would
have
haunt

They

to

this

for

gain
the

favour
his

a
discovery
that
pain

much
as
startle
him

<EOS>
Her
reliance
on
his
secrecy

increase
his
distress
of
mind

if
he
have
speak
boldly

persist
in
question
her

detain
her
when
she
rise

at

Gabriel

his
wig
on

You

gape
at

there
be
my
weakness

I
can
be
obstinate
enough

It
require
a
strong
confidence

veracity
to
lead
any
one
to
this
belief

for
every
sense

faculty
that
Barnahy
possess

be
fix
upon

to
the

something
in

this

more
earnestly

perhaps
in

fickle

so
little

her
feeling

run
so
high

that

sometimes
declare

if

have
good
security
for
a

ten

choice
spot
for
midnight
expedition

in
truth
one
of
more
than
questionable
character
,
and
of
an
appearance
by
no
means
invite
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
main
street
he
have
enter
,
itself
little
well
than
an
alley
,
a
low
-
browe
doorway
lead
into
a
blind
court
,
or
yard
,
profoundly
dark
,
unpaved
,
and
reek
with
stagnant
odour
.
 
<EOS>
into
this
ill
-
favour
pit
,
the
locksmith
's
vagrant
'
prentice
grope
his
way
;
and
stop
at
a
house
from
whose
defaced
and
rotten
front
the
rude
effigy
of
a
bottle
swung
to
and
fro
like
some
gibbet
malefactor
,
strike
thrice
upon
an
iron
grating
with
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
after
listen
in
vain
for
some
response
to
his
signal
,
Mr
Tappertit
become
impatient
,
and
strike
the
grating
thrice
again
.
  
<EOS>
a
further
delay
ensue
,
but
it
be
not
of
long
duration
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
seem
to
open
at
his
foot
,
and
a
ragged
head
appear
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
the
captain
?
"
say
a
voice
as
rag
as
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
Mr
Tappertit
haughtily
,
descend
as
he
speak
,
"
who
should
it
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
late
,

give
you
up

return
the
voice
,
as
its
owner
stop
to
shut
and
fasten
the
grating
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

late

"

"

Mr

with
a
gloomy
majesty
,
"
and
make
remark
when
I
require
you
.
 
<EOS>
forward
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
latter
word
of
command
be
perhaps
somewhat
theatrical
and
unnecessary
,
inasmuch
as
the
descent
be
by
a
very
narrow
,
steep
,
and
slippery
flight
of
step
,
and
any
rashness
or
departure
from
the
beaten
track
must
have
end
in
a
yawn
water
-
butt
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Tappertit
be
,
like
some
other
great
commander
,
favourable
to
strong
effect
,
and
personal
display
,
cry
"
Forward
!
"
<EOS>
again
,
in
the
hoarse
voice
he
could
assume
;
and
lead
the
way
,
with
fold
arm
and
knit
brow
,
to
the
cellar
down
below
,
where
there
be
a
small
copper
fix
in
one
corner
,
a
chair
or
two
,
a
form
and
table
,
a
glimmering
fire
,
and

bed
,
cover
with
a
ragged
patchwork
rug
.
  
<EOS>
"
welcome

noble
captain

cry
a
lanky
figure
,
rise
as
from
a
nap

<EOS>
the
captain
nod
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
throw
off
his
outer
coat
,
he
stand
compose
in
all
his

eye
his

he
ask

nothing

the
other

stretch
himself

and
he
be
so
long
already
that
it
be
quite
alarming
to
see
him

it
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
"
how
come
you
to
be
so
late
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
  
<EOS>
"
play

"

the

moodily

<EOS>
"
light

hearted

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
respect
the
particular
amusement
in
which
these
heedless
spirit
be
indulge
,
for
even
in
the
close
and
stifle
atmosphere
of
the
vault
,
the
noise
sound
like
distant
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
appear
,
at
first
sight
,
a
singular
spot
to
choose
,
for
that
or
any
other
purpose
of
relaxation
,
if
the
other
cellar
answer
to
the
one
in
which
this
brief
colloquy
take
place
;
for
the
floor
be
of
sodden
earth
,
the
wall
and
roof
of
damp
bare
brick
tapestrie
with
the
track
of
snail
and
slug
;
the
air
be
sicken
,
taint
,
and
offensive
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
,
from
one
strong
flavour
which
be
uppermost
among
the
various
odour
of
the
place
,
that
it
have
,
at
no
very
distant
period
,
be
use
as
a
storehouse
for
cheese
;
a
circumstance
which
,
while
it
account
for
the
greasy
moisture
that
hang
about
it
,
be
agreeably
suggestive
of
rat
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
naturally
damp
besides
,
and
little
tree
of
fungus
spring
from
every
mouldering
corner

the
proprietor
of
this
charming
retreat
,

of
the
ragged
head
before

an
old
tie

wig
as
bare
and
frowzy
as

by
this
time
join
them
;
and
stand
a
little
apart
,
rub
his
hand
,
wag
his
hoary
bristle
chin
,
and
smile
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
be
closed
;
but
have
they
be
wide
open
,
it
would
have
be
easy
to
tell
,
from
the
attentive
expression
of
the
face
he
turn
towards
them
---
pale
and
unwholesome
as
may
be
expect
in
one
of
his
underground
existence

and
from
a
certain
anxious
raising

quivering
of
the
lid

that
he

blind

how

of

his
chief

obstruct
the
Lord

to
despise
the
authority

court

nought

not
on

perhaps
she
wonder
what

perhaps
speculate
which

marvel
how

not
sicken

turn

perhaps

a

creaking

then
the

this

Miss

turn
pale

more
than

exclaim

below

"

to
have
some
object
quite
separate
and
disconnected
from
herself
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
discovery
she
become
more
alarmed
than
ever
,
and
be
about
to
give
utterance
to
those
cry
of
"
thief
!
"
and
"
murder
!
"
<EOS>
which
she
have
hitherto
restrain
,
when
it
occur
to
her
to
look
softly
out
,
and
see
that
her
fear
have
some
good
palpable
foundation
.
  
<EOS>
look
out
accordingly
,
and
stretch
her
neck
over
the
handrail
,
she
descry
,
to
her
great
amazement
,
Mr
Tappertit
completely
dress
,
steal
downstairs
,
<EOS>
one
step
at
a
time
,
with
his
shoe
in
one
hand
and
a
lamp
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
follow
him
with
her
eye
,
and
go
down
a
little
way
herself
to
get
the
well
of
an
intervene
angle
,
she
behold
him
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
parlour
-
door
,
draw
it
back
again
with
great
swiftness
,
and
immediately
begin
a
retreat
upstairs
with
all
possible
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
mystery
!
"
say
the
damsel
,
when
she
be
safe
in
her
own
room
again
,
quite
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
gracious
,
here
be
mystery
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
find
anybody
out
in
anything
,
would
have
keep
Miss
Miggs
awake
under
the
influence
of
henbane
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
she
hear
the
step
again
,
as
she
would
have
do
if
it
have
be
that
of
a
feather
endow
with
motion
and
walk
down
on
tiptoe
.
 
<EOS>
then
glide
out
as
before
,
she
again
beheld
the
retreat
figure
of
the
'
prentice
;
again
he
look
cautiously
in
at
the
parlour
-
door
,
but
this
time
instead
of
retreat
,
he
pass
in
and
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
Miggs
be
back
in
her
room
,
and
have
her
head
out
of
the
window
,
before
an
elderly
gentleman
could
have
wink
and
recover
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
out
he
come
at
the
street
-
door
,
shut
it
carefully
behind
him
,
try
it
with
his
knee
,
and
swagger
off
,
put
something
in
his
pocket
as
he
go
along
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
spectacle
Miggs
cry
"
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
again
,
and
then
"
goodness
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
"
goodness
gracious
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
candle
in
hand
,
go
downstairs
as
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
come
to
the
workshop
,
she
see
the
lamp
burn
on
the
forge
,
and
everything
as
Sim
have
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
I
wish
I
may
only
have
a
walk
funeral
,
and
never
be
bury
decent
with
a
mourning
-
coach
and
feather
,
if
the
boy
have
not
be
and
make
a
key
for
his
own
self
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
the
little
villain
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
conclusion
be
not
arrive
at
without
consideration
,
and
much
peeping
and
peer
about
;
nor
be
it
unassiste
by
the
recollection
that
she
have
on
several
occasion
<EOS>
come
upon
the
'
prentice
suddenly
,
and
find
him
busy
at
some
mysterious
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
lest
the
fact
of
Miss
Miggs
call
him
,
on
whom
she
stoop
to
cast
a
favourable
eye
,
a
boy
,
should
create
surprise
in
any
breast
,
it
may
be
observe
that
she
invariably
affect
to
regard
all
male
biped
under
thirty
as
mere
chit
and
infant
;
which
phenomenon
be
not
unusual
in
lady
of
Miss
Miggs
's
temper
,
and
be
indeed
generally
find
to
be
the
associate
of
such
indomitable
and
savage
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
deliberate
within
herself
for
some
little
time
,
look
hard
at
the
shop
-
door
while
she
do
so
,
as
though
her
eye
and
thought
be
both
upon
it
;
and
then
,
take
a
sheet
of
paper
from
a
drawer
,
twist
it
into
a
long
thin
spiral
tube
.
 
<EOS>
have
fill
this
instrument
with
a
quantity
of
small
coal
-
dust
from
the
forge
,
she
approach
the
door
,
and
drop
on
one
knee
before
it
,
dexterously
blow
into
the
keyhole
as
much
of
these
fine
ashe
as
the
lock
would
hold
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
fill
it
to
the
brim
in
a
very
workmanlike
and
skilful
manner
,
she
creep
upstairs
again
,
and
chuckle
as
she
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
!
"
cry
Miggs
,
rub
her
hand
,
"
now
let
's
see
whether
you
will
not
be
glad
to
take
some
notice
of
me

He

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
as
ever

across

"
  
<EOS>
as
she
utter
this
criticism
,
she
glance
approvingly
at
her
small
mirror
,
as
who
should
say
,
I
thank
my
star
that
can
not
be
say
of
me
!
<EOS>
---
as
it
certainly
could
not
;
for
Miss
Miggs
's
style
of
beauty
be
of
that
kind
which
Mr
Tappertit
himself
have
not
inaptly
term
,
in
private
,
"
scraggy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

this
night

<EOS>
say
Miggs
,
wrap
herself
in
a
shawl
,
and
draw
a
couple
of
chair
near
the
window
,
flounce
down
upon
one
,
and
put
her
foot
upon
the
other
,
"
till
you
come
home
,
my

<EOS>
I
would
not

Miggs
viciously
,
"
no
,
not
for
five
-
and
-
forty
pound
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
and
with
an
expression
of
face
in
which
a
great
number
of
opposite
ingredient
,
such
as
mischief
,
cunning
,
malice
,
triumph
,
and
patient
expectation
,
be
all
mix
up
together
in
a
kind
of
physiognomical
punch
,
Miss
Miggs
compose
herself
to
wait
and
listen
,
like
some
fair
ogress
who
have
set
a
trap
and
be
watch
for
a
nibble
from
a
plump
young
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
there
,
with
perfect
composure
,
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
just
upon
break
of
day
,
there
be
a
footstep
in
the
street
,
and
presently
she
could
hear
Mr
Tappertit
stop
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
could
make
out
that
he
try
his
key
---
that
he
be
blow
into
it
---
 
that
he
knock
it
on
the
near
post
to
beat
the
dust
out
---
that
he
take
it
under
a
lamp
to
look
at
it
---
that
he
poke
bit
of
stick
into
the
lock
to
clear
it
---
that
he
peep
into
the
keyhole
,
first
with
one
eye
,
and
then
with
the
other
---
that
he
try
the
key
again
---
 
that
he
could
not
turn
it
,
and
what
be
bad
<EOS>
,
could
not
get
it
out
---
 
that
he
bend
it
---
<EOS>
that
then
it
be
much
less
disposed
to
come
out
than
before
---
that
he
give
it
a
mighty
twist
and
a
great
pull
,
and
then
it
come
out
so
suddenly
that
he
stagger
backwards
---
that
he
kick
the
door
---
that
he
shake
it
---
finally
,
that
he
smote
his
forehead
,
and
sit
down
on
the
step
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
crisis
have
arrive
,
Miss
Miggs
,
affect
to
be
exhaust
with
terror
,
and
to
cling
to
the
window

sill
for
support
,
put
out
her
nightcap
,
and
demand
in
a
faint
voice
who

<EOS>
Mr

Hush

and

back
to

perhaps
in

degree
from

peculiar

already
remark

carry

upstairs

plant
her

just

It
be
on
one
of
those
morning

common
in

when

be
undecided

to
step
backward
into
winter

forward
into
summer

and
in
its
uncertainty
incline
now
to
the
one
and
now
to
the
other

and
now
to
both
at
once
---
woo
summer
in
the
sunshine
,
and
linger
still
with
winter
in
the
shade

it

of

when
it

cold

wet

dry

bright
and
lowering
,
sad

cheerful

withering

of

check
his

at
the
Maypole
door

He
be
none

make
themselves
as
much

as
if
they
have
order
a
hogshead
of
wine
;
none
of
your
audacious
young
swaggerer

who
would
even
penetrate
into
the
bar
---
that
solemn
sanctuary

and
,
smite
old
John
upon
the
back

inquire
if
there

never
a
pretty

in

and
where
he
hide
his
little
chambermaid
,
with
a
hundred
other
impertinence
of
that
nature
;
none
of
your
free
-
and
-
easy
companion
,
who
would
scrape
their
boot
upon
the
firedog
in
the
common
room
,
and
be
not
at
all
particular
on
the
subject
of
spittoon

none

unconscionable

require
impossible

<EOS>
He
be
a
staid
,
grave
,
placid
gentleman
,
something
past
the
prime
of
life
,
yet
upright
in
his
carriage
,
for
all
that
,
and
slim
as
a
greyhound
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
well
-
mount
upon
a
sturdy
chestnut
cob
,
and
have
the
graceful
seat
of
an
experienced
horseman
;
while
his
ride
gear
,
though
free
from
such
fopperie
as
be
then
in
vogue
,
be
handsome
and
well
choose
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
riding
-
coat
of
a
somewhat
brighter
green
than
may
have
be
expect
to
suit
the
taste
of
a
gentleman
of
his
year
,
with
a
short
,
black
velvet
cape
,
and
lace
pocket
-
hole
and
cuff
,
all
of
a
jaunty
fashion
;
his
linen
,
too
,
be
of
the
fine
kind
,
work
in
a
rich
pattern
at
the
wrist
and
throat
,
and
scrupulously
white
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
seem
,
judge
from
the
mud
he
have
pick
up
on
the
way
,
to
have
come
from
London
,
his
horse
be
as
smooth
and
cool
as
his
own
iron
-
grey
periwig
and
pigtail
.
 
<EOS>
neither
man
nor
beast
have
turn
a
single
hair
;
and
save
for
his
soiled
skirt
and
spatter
-
dash
,
this
gentleman
,
with
his
blooming
face
,
white
tooth
,
exactly
-
order
dress
,
and
perfect
calmness
,
may
have
come
from
make
an
elaborate
and
leisurely
toilet
,
to
sit
for
an
equestrian
portrait
at
old
John
Willet
's
gate
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
John
observe
these
several
characteristic
by
other
than
very
slow
degree
,
or
that
he
take
in
more
than
half
a
one
at
a
time
,
or
that
he
even
make
up
his
mind
upon
that
,
without
a
great
deal
of
very
serious
consideration
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
he
have
be
distract
in
the
first
instance
by
questioning
and
order
,
it
would
have
take
him
at
the
least
a
fortnight
to
have
note
what
be
here
set
down
;
but
it
happen
that
the
gentleman
,
be
strike
with
the
old
house
,
or
with
the
plump
pigeon
which
be
skim
and
curtsey
about
it
,
or
with
the
tall
maypole
,
on
the
top
of
which
a
weathercock
,
which
have
be
out
of
order
for
fifteen
year
,
perform
a
perpetual
walk
to
the
music
of
its
own
creaking
,
sit
for
some
little
time
look
round
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
hence
John
,
stand
with
his
hand
upon
the
horse
's
bridle
,
and
his
great
eye
on
the
rider
,
<EOS>
and
with
nothing
pass
to
divert
his
thought
,
have
really
get
some
of
these
little
circumstance
into
his
brain
by
the
time
he
be
call
upon
to
speak

<EOS>
"

It

Mr
Willet
,
who
appear
to
entertain
strong
doubt
whether
a
customer
in
a
laced
coat
and
fine
linen
could
be
suppose
to
have
any
acquaintance
even
with
the
existence
of
such
unpolite
gentry
as
the
bird
claim
to
belong
to
,
take
Barnaby
off
at
this
juncture
,
with
the
view
of
prevent
any
other
improper
declaration

there
be
great
news
that
night
for
the
regular
Maypole
customer
,
to
each
of

,
as

in

occupy
his
allot

in
the
chimney

corner
,
John
,
with
a
most
impressive
slowness
of
delivery
,
and
in
an
apoplectic
whisper
,
communicate
the
fact
that
Mr
Chester
be
alone
in
the
large
room
upstairs
,
and
be
wait
the
arrival
of
Mr
Geoffrey
Haredale
,
to
whom
he
have
send
a
letter
(
doubtless
of
a
threatening
nature
)
by
the
hand
of
Barnaby
,
then
and
there
present
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
little
knot
of
smoker
and
solemn
gossip
,
who
have
seldom
any
new
topic
of
discussion
,
this
be
a
perfect
Godsend

here
be

looking

bring
home
to
the
fireside
,
as
it
be
,
and
enjoyable
without
the
small
pain
or
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
extraordinary
what
a
z
and
relish
it
give
to
the
drink
,
and
how
it
heighten
the
flavour
of
the
tobacco
.
 
<EOS>
every
man
smoke
his
pipe
with
a
face
of
grave
and
serious
delight
,
and
look
at
his
neighbour
with
a
sort
of
quiet
congratulation
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
be
feel
to
be
such
a
holiday
and
special
night
,
that
,
on
the
motion
of
little
Solomon
Daisy
,
every
man
(
include
John
himself
)
put
down
his
sixpence
for
a
can
of
flip
,
which
grateful
beverage
be
brew
with
all
despatch
,
and
set
down
in
the
midst
of
them
on
the
brick
floor
;
both
that
it
may
simmer
and
stew
before
the
fire
,
and
that
its
fragrant
steam
,
rise
up
among
them
,
and
mix
with
the
wreath
of
vapour
from
their
pipe
,
may
shroud
them
in
a
delicious
atmosphere
of
their
own
,
and
shut
out
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
furniture
of
the
room
seem
to
mellow
and
deepen
in
its
tone
;
the
ceiling
and
wall
look
blacker
and
more
highly
polished
,
the
curtain
of
a
ruddier
red
;
the
fire
burn
clear
and
high
,
and
the
cricket
in
the
hearthstone
chirp
with
a
more
than
wonte
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
present
two
,
however
,
who
show
but
little
interest
in
the
general
contentment
.
 
<EOS>
of
these
,
one
be
Barnaby
himself
,
who
sleep
,
or
,
to
avoid
be
beset
with
question
,
feign
to
sleep
,
in
the
chimney
-
corner
;
the
other
,
Hugh
,
who
,
sleep
too
,
lie
stretch
upon
the
bench
on
the
opposite
side
,
in
the
full
glare
of
the
blaze
fire
.
  
<EOS>
the
light
that
fall
upon
this
slumber
form
,
show
it
in
all
its
muscular
and
handsome
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
that
of
a
young
man
,
of
a
hale
athletic
figure
,
and
a
giant
's
strength
,
whose
sunburnt
face
and
swarthy
throat
,
overgrow
with
jet
black
hair
,
may
have
serve
a
painter
for
a
model

<EOS>
loosely
attire
,
in
the
coarse
and
roughest
garb
,
with
scrap
of
straw
and
hay
---
his
usual
bed
---
 
cling
here
and
there
,
and
mingle
with
his
uncombed
lock
,
he
have
fall
asleep
in
a
posture
as
careless
as
his
dress
.
 
<EOS>
the
negligence
and
disorder
of
the
whole
man
,
with
something
fierce
and
sullen
in
his
feature
,
give
him
a
picturesque
appearance
,
that
attract
the
regard
even
of
the
Maypole
customer
who
know
him
well
,
and
cause
Long
Parkes
to
say
that
Hugh
look
more
like
a
poaching
rascal
to
-
night
than
ever
he
have
see
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
wait
here

I
suppose

Solomon

"
to
take
Mr

"
  
<EOS>

that
be
it

reply
John
Willet

<EOS>
"
He
be
not
often

the
house

<EOS>
He
be
more
at
his
ease
among
horse
than
man

<EOS>
I
look
upon
him
as
a
animal
himself

"
  
<EOS>
follow
up
this
opinion
with
a
shrug
that
seem
mean
to
say
,

we
can
not
expect
everybody
to
be
like
us

John
put
his
pipe
into

mouth
again

smoke
like

who
feel
his
superiority
over

general
run

the

seem

feel

be
all
in

derive
a

from
it

put

fall
out

We

They
fall
in

form
what

call
an
attachment

a
something
fanciful

false

,

aloof

away
thoughtfully
at

after

consideration

it
be
decide
that
he
have
leave

it
vigorously

overthrew
all

<EOS>
at
length
Mr

agree
to
go
upstairs
himself

<EOS>
his
account
with
a
certain
vintner

not

be
the
end

object

journey
for

so
surely
as

come

<EOS>
this
journey
be
perform
upon
an
old
grey
mare
,
concern
whom
John
have
an
indistinct
set
of
idea
hover
about
him
,
to
the
effect
that
she
could
win
a
plate
or
cup
if
she
try

<EOS>
She
never
have
try
,
and
probably
never
would
now
,
be
some
fourteen
or
fifteen
year
of
age
,
short
in
wind
,
long
in
body
,
and
rather
the
bad
for

in
respect
of
her
mane

<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
slight
defect
,
John
perfectly
glory
in

and
when
she
be
bring
round
to
the
door
by
Hugh
,
actually
retire
into
the
bar
,
and
there
,
in
a
secret

of
lemon
,
laugh
with
pride

"

there

so
Hugh

as
he
sit
sideways
in
the

lazily
double
up
with

heedless
of
the

saunter
up

Joe
reply

cast
a

<EOS>
to
this

Joe
make
no
answer

beckon
Hugh

leap
into
the
saddle
and
ride
away
;
and
a
very
stalwart
,
manly
horseman
he
look
,
deserve
a
well
charger
than
it
be
his
fortune
to
bestride
.
 
<EOS>
John
stand
stare
after
him
,
or
rather
after
the
grey
mare
(
for
he
have
no
eye
for
her
rider
)
,
until
man
and
beast
have
be
out
of
sight
some
twenty
minute
,
when
he
begin
to
think
they
be
go
,
and
slowly
re
-
enter
the
house
,
fall
into
a
gentle
doze
.
  
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
grey
mare
,
who
be
the
agony
of
Joe
's
life
,
flounder
along
at
her
own
will
and
pleasure
until
the
Maypole
be
no
longer
visible
,
and
then
,
contract
her
leg
into
what
in
a
puppet
would
have
be
look
upon
as
a
clumsy
and
awkward
imitation
of
a
canter
,
mend
her
pace
all
at
once
,
and
do
it
of
her
own
accord
.
 
<EOS>
the
acquaintance
with
her
rider
's
usual
mode
of
proceeding
,
which
suggest
this
improvement
in
her
,
impel
her
likewise
to
turn
up
a
bye
-
way
,
lead
---
not
to
London
,
but
through
lane
run
parallel
with
the
road
they
have
come
,
and
pass
within
a
few
hundred
yard
of
the
Maypole
,
which
lead
finally
to
an
inclosure
surround
a
large
,
old
,
red
-
brick
mansion
---
the
same
of
which
mention
be
make
as
the
Warren
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
come
to
a
dead
stop
in
a
little
copse
thereabout
,
she
suffer
her
rider
to
dismount
with
right
goodwill
,
and
to
tie
her
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
stay
there
,
old
girl
,
"
say
Joe
,
"
and
let
us
see
whether
there
be
any
little
commission
for
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
leave
her
to
browze
upon
such
stunted
grass
and
weed
as
happen
to
grow
within
the
length
of
her
tether
,
and
pass
through
a
wicket
gate
,
enter
the
ground
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
the
pathway
,
after
a
very
few
minute
'
walking
,
bring
him
close
to
the
house
,
towards
which
,
and
especially
towards
one
particular
window
,
he
direct
many
covert
glance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreary
,
silent
building
,
with
echo
courtyard
,
desolated
turret
-
chamber
,
and
whole
suite
of
room
shut
up
and
moulder
to
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
the
terrace
-
garden
,
dark
with
the
shade
of
overhang
tree
,
have
an
air
of
melancholy
that
be
quite
oppressive
.
 
<EOS>
great
iron
gate
,
disuse
for
many
year
,
and
red
with
rust
,
droop
on
their
hinge
and
overgrow
with
long
rank
grass
,
seem
as
though
they
try
to
sink
into
the
ground
,
and
hide
their
fall
state
among
the
friendly
weed
.
 
<EOS>
the
fantastic
monster
on
the
wall
,
green
with
age
and
damp
,
and
cover
here
and
there
with
moss
,
look
grim
and
desolate
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
sombre
aspect
even
on
that
part
of
the
mansion
which
be
inhabit
and
keep
in
good
repair
,
that
strike
the
beholder
with
a
sense
of
sadness
;
of
something
forlorn
and
fail
,
whence
cheerfulness
be
banish
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
bright
fire
blaze
in
the
dull
and
darken
room
,
or
to
picture
any
gaiety
of
heart
or
revelry
that
the
frown
wall
shut
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
a
place
where
such
thing
have
be
,
but
could
be
no
more
---
the
very
ghost
of
a
house
,
haunt
the
old
spot
in
its
old
outward
form
,
and
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
much
of
this
decayed
and
sombre
look
be
attributable
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
death
of
its
former
master
,
and
the
temper
of
its
present
occupant
;
but
remember
the
tale
connect
with
the
mansion
<EOS>
,
it
seem
the
very
place
for
such
a
deed
,
and
one
that
may
have
be
its
predestined
theatre
year
upon
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
view
with
reference
to
this
legend
,
the
sheet
of
water
where
the
steward
's
body
have
be
find
appear
to
wear
a
black
and
sullen
character
,
such
as
no
other
pool
may
own
;
the
bell
upon
the
roof
that
have
tell
the
tale
of
murder
to
the
midnight
wind
,
become
a
very
phantom
whose
voice
would
raise
the
listener
's
hair
on
end
;
and
every
leafless
bough
that
nod
to
another
,
have
its
stealthy
whispering
of
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
pace
up
and
down
the
path
,
sometimes
stop
in
affected
contemplation
of
the
building
or
the
prospect
,
sometimes
lean
against
a
tree
with
an
assumed
air
of
idleness
and
indifference
,
but
always
keep
an
eye
upon
the
window
he
have
single
out
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
quarter
of
an
hour
's
delay
,
a
small
white
hand
be
wave
to
him
for
an
instant
from
this
casement
,
and
the
young
man
,
with
a
respectful
bow
,
depart
;
say
under
his
breath
as
he
cross
his
horse
again
,
"
no
errand
for
me
to
-
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
air
of
smartness
,
the
cock
of
the
hat
to
which
John
Willet
have
object
,
and
the
spring
nosegay
,
all
betoken
some
little
errand
of
his
own
,
have
a
more
interesting
object
than
a
vintner
or
even
a
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
indeed
,
it
turn
out
;
for
when
he
have
settle
with
the
vintner
---
whose
place
of
business
be
down
in
some
deep
cellar
hard
by
Thames
Street
,
and
who
be
as
purple
-
face
an
old
gentleman
as
if
he
have
all
his
life
support
their
arched
roof
on
his
head
---
when
he
have
settle
the
account
,
and
take
the
receipt
,
and
decline
taste
more
than
three
glass
of
old
sherry
,
to
the
unbounded
astonishment
of
the
purple

face
vintner
,
who
,
gimlet
in
hand
,
have
project
an
attack
upon
at
least
a
score
of
dusty
cask
,
and
who
stand
transfixed
,
or
morally
gimlete
as
it
be
,
to
his
own
wall
---
when
he
have
do
all
this
,
and
dispose
besides
of
a
frugal
dinner
at
the
Black
Lion
in
Whitechapel
;
spurn
the
Monument
and
John

advice
,
he
turn
his
step
towards
the
locksmith
's
house
,
attract
by
the
eye
of
bloom
Dolly
Varden

<EOS>
Joe
be
by
no
mean
a
sheepish
fellow
,
but
,
for
all
that
,
when
he
get
to
the
corner
of
the
street
in
which
the
locksmith
live
,
he
could
by
no
mean
make
up
his
mind
to
walk
straight
to
the
house

<EOS>
first
,
he
resolve
to
stroll
up
another
street
for
five
minute
,
then
up
another
street
for
five
minute
more
,
and
so
on
until
he
have
lose
full
half
an
hour
,
when
he
make
a
bold
plunge
and
find
himself
with
a
red
face

a
beat
heart
in
the
smoky
workshop

it

so
dark

so
deserted

perfectly
disenchanted

It

such
sheer
nonsense

sit
tamely
there

when
she

dance
with
more
lover

man
could
calculate

about

that
here
be
an
end

all
his
hope

that
the
thing
be
impossible
and
never
could
be

that
she
do
not
care
for
him
---
that
he
be
wretched
for
life

and
that
the
only
congenial
prospect
leave
him
,
be
to
go
for
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
,
and
get
some
oblige

knock
his
brain
out
as
soon

vanish
from

about
eighteen

nineteen

It

about

these

be
so
extremely
dry
,
that
I
be
sorry
to
say
they
do
not
admit
of
any
such
relief
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
for
that
reason
,
and
because
they
have
an
appearance
of
business

that
I
dislike
them
so
very
much

<EOS>
well

You

two

three

twenty

like
meat

Good
God

how
disagreeable

consider
the
impossibility

any
respect

Chapter
16
    
a
series
of
picture
represent
the
street
of
London
in
the
night
,
even
at
the
comparatively
recent
date
of
this
tale
,
would
present
to
the
eye
something
so
very
different
in
character
from
the
reality
which
be
witness
in
these
time
,
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
beholder
to
recognise
his
most
familiar
walk
in
the
altered
aspect
of
little
more
than
half
a
century
ago
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
,
one
and
all
,
from
the
broad
and
good
to
the
narrow
and
least
frequented
,
very
dark
.
 
<EOS>
the
oil
and
cotton
lamp
,
though
regularly
trim
twice
or
thrice
in
the
long
winter
night
,
burn
feebly
at
the
good
;
and
at
a
late
hour
,
when
they
be
unassiste
by
the
lamp
and
candle
in
the
shop
,
cast
but
a
narrow
track
of
doubtful
light
upon
the
footway
,
leave
the
projecting
door
and
house
-
front
in
the
deep
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
court
and
lane
be
leave
in
total
darkness
;
those
of
the
mean
sort
,
where
one
glimmer
light
twinkle
for
a
score
of
house
,
be
favour
in
no
slight
degree
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
these
place
,
the
inhabitant
have
often
good
reason
for
extinguish
their
lamp
as
soon
as
it
be
light
;
and
the
watch
be
utterly
inefficient
and
powerless
to
prevent
them
,
they
do
so
at
their
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
in
the
light
thoroughfare
,
there
be
at
every
turn
some
obscure
and
dangerous
spot
whither
a
thief
may
fly
or
shelter
,
and
few
would
care
to
follow
;
and
the
city
be
belt
round
by
field
,
green
lane
,
waste
ground
,
and
lonely
road
,
divide
it
at
that
time
from
the
suburb
that
have
join
it
since
,
escape
,
even
where
the
pursuit
be
hot
,
be
render
easy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
that
with
these
favour
circumstance
in
full
and
constant
operation
,
street
robbery
,
often
accompany
by
cruel
wound
,
and
not
unfrequently
by
loss
of
life
,
should
have
be
of
nightly
occurrence
in
the
very
heart
of
London
,
or
that
quiet
folk
should
have
have
great
dread
of
traverse
its
street
after
the
shop
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
unusual
for
those
who
wend
home
alone
at
midnight
,
to
keep
the
middle
of
the
road
,
the
well
to
guard
against
surprise
from
lurk
footpad
;
few
would
venture
to
repair
at
a
late
hour
to
Kentish
Town
or
Hampstead
,
or
even
to
Kensington
or
Chelsea
,
unarmed
and
unattended
;
while
he
who
have
be
loud
and
most
valiant
at
the
supper
-
table
or
the
tavern
,
and
have
but
a
mile
or
so
to
go
,
be
glad
to
fee
a
link
-
boy
to
escort
him
home
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
other
characteristic
---
not
quite
so
disagreeable
---
 
about
the
thoroughfare
of
London
then
,
with
which
they
have

long
familiar

<EOS>
some
of
the

,
especially
those
to
the
eastward
of
Temple
Bar
,
still
adhere
to
the
old
practice
of
hang
out
a
sign
;
and
the
creaking
and
swinging
of
these
board
in
their
iron
frame
on
windy
night
,
form
a
strange
and
mournfal
concert
for
the
ear
of
those
who
lay
awake
in
bed
or
hurry
through
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
long
stand
of
hackney

chair
and
group
of

compare
with

our

cross
the

by
the
stifled
roar
of
voice
from
below

yawn
for
the
reception

entertainment
of
the
most
abandon
of
both

under

small

way
to
sleep
,
and
let
the
fragment
of
his
torch
fall
hiss
on

then
there
be
the

and
the
kind
of

those

among

there

one
man
from

many

fierce

shrink
with
an
involuntary
dread

who
he

or
<EOS>
whence
he

be
a
question
often

which

<EOS>
His

be
unknown
,
he
have
never
be
see
until
within
about
eight
day
or
thereabout

and
be
equally
a
stranger
to
the
old
ruffian
,
upon
whose
haunt
he
venture
fearlessly
,
as
to
the
young

<EOS>
He
could
be
no
spy

for
he
never
remove
his
slouched
hat
to
look
about
him
,
enter
into
conversation
with
no

heed
nothing
that
pass
,
listen
to
no

,
regard
nobody
that
come

<EOS>
but
so
surely
as
the
dead
of
night
set
in
,
so
surely
this
man
be
in
the
midst
of
the
loose
concourse
in
the
night
-
cellar
where
outcast
of
every
grade
resort
;
and
there
he
sit
till
morning

<EOS>
He
be
not
only
a
spectre
at
their
licentious
feast

a
something
in

midst
of
their

riot
that
chill
and
haunt
them

but
out
of
door
he
be
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
directly
it
be
dark
,
he
be
abroad
---
never
in
company
with
any
one
,
but
always
alone
;
never
linger
or
loitering
,
but
always
walk
swiftly
;
and
look
(
so
they
say
who
have
see
him
)
over
his
shoulder
from
time
to
time
,
and
as
he
do
so
quicken
his
pace

<EOS>
in

so
lose
him
in
the
darkness

<EOS>
this
constant
restlessness
,

give
rise

He

distant

remote

at

so
nearly
tally
with

some
doubt
whether
there
be
not
two
of
them

or
more
---
some
,
whether
he
have
not
unearthly
mean
of
travel
from
spot
to
spot

<EOS>
the
footpad
hide
in
a
ditch
have
mark
him
pass
like
a
ghost
along
its
brink
;
the
vagrant
have
meet
him
on
the
dark
high
-
road
;
the
beggar
have
see
him
pause
upon
the
bridge
to
look
down
at
the
water
,
and
then
sweep
on
again
;
they
who
deal
in
body
with
the
surgeon
could
swear
he
sleep
in
churchyard
,
and
that
they
have
behold
him
glide
away
among
the
tomb
on
their
approach
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
they
tell
these
story
to
each
other
,
one
who
have
look
about
him
would
pull
his
neighbour
by
the
sleeve
,
and
there
he
would
be
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
at
last

one
man

he

one
of
those
whose

strange

next

<EOS>
"

return
the
other
,
rise
and
turn
upon
him
,
and
look
fiercely
round
as

in
apprehension

a
general
attack

<EOS>
His
voice

look

all
expressive
of
the
wild
recklessness

desperation

daunt
while

repel

although
in
a
very
different
sphere

action
now

they
be
not

much
of

"

"
  
<EOS>
a
low
murmur
,
have
its
origin
perhaps
in
a
dread
of
the
man
and
the
mystery
that
surround
him
,
or
perhaps
in
a
sincere
opinion
on
the
part
of
some
of
those
present
,
that
it
would
be
an
inconvenient
precedent
to
meddle
too
curiously
with
a

's
private

discussion

after
a
short
time

lie
down
upon

this

cross
London

down
a

a
woman
with
a
little
basket
on

turn
into

at
the
other

directly
he

he
seek
the
shelter
of
an
archway

stand
aside

then

It

o'clock

the

doubtless
to

the

She
turn
into

from

in

flush

with

the
pleasure

she

she

silently
beside

the
apparition
of
a
dream

<EOS>
His
hand
be
on
her
mouth
,
but
that

needless

for
her
tongue
clove
to

of
utterance

She

He

in

it
carefully
behind

Chapter

<EOS>
It
be
a
chilly
night
,
and
the
fire
in
the
widow

parlour
have
burn
low
.
 
<EOS>
Her
strange
companion
place
her
in
a
chair
,
and
stoop
down
before
the

extinguish
ashe

rake
them
together
and
fan
them
with
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
he
glance
at
her
over
his
shoulder
,
as
though
to
assure
himself
of
her
remain
quiet
and
make
no
effort
to
depart
;
and
that
do

busy
himself
about
the

again

<EOS>
It
be
not

for

his

<EOS>
It
have
rain
hard
during
the
previous
night
and
for
some
hour
in
the
morning
,
but
since
noon
it
have
be
fine
.
 
<EOS>
Wheresoever
he
have
pass
the
hour
of
darkness
,
his
condition
sufficiently
betoken
that
many
of
them
have
be
spend
beneath
the
open
sky
.
 
<EOS>
besmear
with
mire
;
his
saturate
clothe
cling
with
a
damp
embrace
about
his
limb
;
his
beard
unshaven
,
his
face
unwashed
,
his
meagre
cheek
wear
into
deep
hollow
,
---
a
more
miserable
wretch
could
hardly
be
,
than
this
man
who
now
cower
down
upon
the
widow
's
hearth
,
and
watch
the

flame
with
bloodshot
eye

She

cover
her

with

,
fear

as
it

to

so
they

in

It

why

"
  
<EOS>
"
give

meat

he

sullenly
,
"
or
I

<EOS>
the

I

He
hide
himself
even
from
these
partaker
of
his
lonely
walk
,
and
,
shrink
in
some
arch
or
doorway
while
they
pass
,
issue
forth
again
when
they
be
go
and
so
pursue
his
solitary
way
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
shelterless
and
alone
in
the
open
country
,
hear
the
wind
moan
and
watch
for
day
through
the
whole
long
weary
night
;
to
listen
to
the
fall
rain
,
and
crouch
for
warmth
beneath
the
lee
of
some
old
barn
or
rick
,
or
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
;
be
dismal
thing
---
but
not
so
dismal
as
the
wandering
up
and
down
where
shelter
be
,
and
bed
and
sleeper
be
by
thousand
;
a
houseless
reject
creature

count
the
dull
chime

;
to
watch
the
light
twinkle
in
chamber
window
,
to
think
what
happy
forgetfulness
each
house
shut
in
;
that
here
be
child
coil
together
in
their
bed
,
here
youth
,
here
age
,
here
poverty
,
here
wealth
,
all
equal
in
their
sleep

all
at
rest

to
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
slumbering
world
around
,
not
even
sleep
,
Heaven
's
gift
to
all
its
creature
,
and
be
akin
to
nothing
but
despair
;
to
feel
,
by
the
wretched
contrast
with
everything
on
every
hand
,
more
utterly
alone
and
cast
away
than
in
a
trackless
desert
;
this
be
a
kind
of
suffering
,
on
which
the
river
of
great
city
close
full
many
a
time
,
and
which
the
solitude
in
crowd
alone
awaken
.
  
<EOS>
the
miserable
man
pace
up
and
down
the
street
---
so
long
,
so
wearisome
,
<EOS>
so
like
each
other
---
and
often
cast
a
wistful
look
towards
the
east
,
hope
to
see
the
first
faint
streak
of
day
.
<EOS>
but
obdurate
night
have
yet
possession
of
the
sky
,
and
his
disturbed
and
restless
walk
find
no
relief
.
  
<EOS>
one
house
in
a
back
street
be
bright
with
the
cheerful
glare
of
light
;
there
be
the
sound
of
music
in
it
too
,
and
the
tread
of
dancer
,
and
there
be
cheerful
voice
,
and
many
a
burst
of
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
place
---
to
be
near
something
that
be
awake
and
glad
---
he
return
again
and
again
;
and
more
than
one
of
those
who
leave
it
when
the
merriment
be
at
its
height
,
feel
it
a
check
upon
their
mirthful
mood
to
see
him
flit
to
and
fro
like
an
uneasy
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
the
guest
depart
,
one
and
all
;
and
then
the
house
be
close
shut
up
,
and
become
as
dull
and
silent
as
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
His
wandering
bring
him
at
one
time
to
the
city
jail
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
hasten
from
it
as
a
place
of
ill
oman
,
and
one
he
have
cause
to
shun
,
he
sit
down
on
some
step
hard
by
,
and
rest
his
chin
upon
his
hand
,
gaze
upon
its
rough
and
frown
wall
as
though
even
they
become
a
refuge
in
his
jade
eye
.
 
<EOS>
He
pace
it
round
and
round
,
come
back
to
the
same
spot
,
and
sit
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
this
often
,
and
once
,
with
a
hasty
movement
,
cross
to
where
some
man
be
watch
in
the
prison
lodge
,
and
have
his
foot
upon
the
step
as
though
determine
to
accost
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
look
round
,
he
see
that
the
day
begin
to
break
,
and
fail
in
his
purpose
,
turn
and
flee
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
soon
in
the
quarter
he
have
lately
traverse
,
and
pace
to
and
fro
again
as
he
have
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pass
down
a
mean
street
,
when
from
an
alley
close
at
hand
some
shout
of
revelry
arise
,
and
there
come
straggle
forth
a
dozen
madcap
,
whooping
and
call
to
each
other
,
who
,
part
noisily
,
take
different
way
and
disperse
in
small
group
.
  
<EOS>
hope
that
some
low
place
of
entertainment
which
would
afford
him
a
safe
refuge
may
be
near
at
hand
,
he
turn
into
this
court
when
they
be
all
go
,
and
look
about
for
a
half
-
open
door
,
or
light
window
,
or
other
indication
of
<EOS>
the
place
whence
they
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
profoundly
dark
,
however
,
and
so
ill
-
favour
,
that
he
conclude
they
have
but
turn
up
there
,
miss
their
way
,
and
be
pour
out
again
when
he
observe
them
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
impression
,
and
find
there
be
no
outlet
but
that
by
which
he
have
enter
,
he
be
about
to
turn
,
when
from
a
grating
near
his
foot
a
sudden
stream
of
light
appear
,
and
the
sound
of
talking
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
retreat
into
a
doorway
to
see
who
these
talker
be
,
and
to
listen
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
light
come
to
the
level
of
the
pavement
as
he
do
this
,
and
a

ascend
,
bear
in
his

a
torch

<EOS>
this
figure
unlock
and
hold
open
the
grating
as
for
the
passage
of
another

who
presently
appear

in
the
form
of
a
young

small

desire
Sim
Tappertit
to
open
the
glass
door
and
give
him
admission
---
from
which
untoward
circumstance
the
good
lady
argue
(
for
she
could
deduce
a
precious
moral
from
the
most
trifling
event
)
<EOS>
that
to
take
a
draught
of
small
ale
in
the
morning
be
to
observe
a
pernicious
,
irreligious
,
and
Pagan
custom
,
the
relish
whereof
should
be
leave
to
swine
,
and
Satan
,
or
at
least
to
popish
person
,
and
should
be
shun
by
the
righteous
as
a
work
of
sin
and
evil
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
no
doubt
have
pursue
her
admonition
much
further
,
and
would
have
found
on
it
a
long
list
of
precious
precept
of
inestimable
value
,
but
that
the
young
gentleman
stand
by
in
a
somewhat
uncomfortable
and
discomfited
manner
while
she
read
her
spouse
<EOS>
this
lecture
,
occasion
her
to
bring
it
to
a
premature
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
will
excuse
me
,
sir

"
say
Mrs

rising
and
curtseying

very
thoughtless

<EOS>
Mr

obey
again
,
still
under

betake
himself
to
the

seriously
to

find
it
necessary

his

<EOS>
this
little
incident
,
illustrative
though
it
be
of
Mrs

's
extraordinary
sweetness
and
amiability
,
have
so
strong
a
tendency

check

to
disconcert
all

that
excellent

monosyllable

come
back
with
his

in
his
pocket
;
and
,
after
fidget
about
the
room
in
a
very
uneasy
manner
,
and
cast
a
great
many
sidelong
look
at
Mrs

(
who
with
the
calm
countenance
in
the
world
be
five
fathom
deep
in
the
Protestant
Manual

inquire
of
Dolly

herself
silently
appeal

dive
down
at

another
fathom
into

<EOS>
"
I

without
rise
to
the
surface

"
I
be
sorry

my

you
have
such
an
objection
to
the
Maypole

old
John

for
otherway
as
it
be
a
very
fine
morning
,
and
Saturday
be
not
a
busy

may
have
all

immediately
close
the

burst
into
tear
,
request
to
be
lead
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
now
,
Martha
?
"
inquire
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
to
which
Martha
rejoin
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
do
not
speak
to
me
,
"
and
protest
in
agony
that
if
anybody
have
tell
her
so
,
she
would
not
have
believe
it

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
Martha
,
"
say
Gabriel
,
put
himself
in
the
way

she
be
move
off
with
the
aid
of
Dolly
's
shoulder
,

would
not
have
believe

tell

what
be
wrong
now

do
tell

<EOS>
upon
my
soul
I

do
you
know

<EOS>
Damme

cry
the
locksmith
,
pluck
at
his
wig
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
,
"
nobody
do
know
,
I
verily
believe
,
but
Miggs
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miggs
,
"
say
Mrs
Varden
faintly
,
and
with
symptom
of
approach
incoherence
,
"
be
attach
to
me
,
and
that
be
sufficient
to
draw
down
hatred
upon
her
in
this
house

<EOS>
She
be
a
comfort
to
me

whatever
she

<EOS>
"
She

no

Gabriel
,
make
bold
by
despair

She
be
the
misery
of
my
life

<EOS>
She
be
all
the
plague
of
Egypt

<EOS>
"
She
be
consider
so
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
say
Mrs
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
prepare
for
that
;
it
be
natural
;
it
be
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
when
you
taunt
me
as
you
do
to
my
face
,
how
can
I
wonder
that
you
taunt
her
behind
her
back
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
here
the
incoherence
come
on
very
strong
,
Mrs
Varden
weep
,
and
laugh
,
and
sob
,
and
shiver
,
and
hiccough
,
and
choke
;
and
say
she
know
it
be
very
foolish
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
help
it
;
and
that
when
she
be
dead
and
go
,
perhaps
they
would
be
sorry
for
it
---
which
really
under
the
circumstance
do
not
appear
quite
so
probable
as
she
seem
to
think

with
a
great
deal
more
to
the

effect

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
pass
with
great
decency
through
all
the
ceremony
incidental
to
such
occasion
;
and
be
support
upstairs
,
be
deposit
in
a
highly
spasmodic
state
on
her
own
bed
,
where
Miss
Miggs
shortly
afterwards
fling
herself
upon
the
body
.
  
<EOS>
the
philosophy
of
all
this
be
,
that
Mrs
Varden
want
to
go
to
Chigwell
;
that
she
do
not
want
to
make
any
concession
or
explanation
;
that
she
would
only
go
on
be
implore
and
entreat
so
to
do
;
and
that
she
would
accept
no
other
term
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
after
a
vast
amount
of
moan
and
cry
upstairs
,
and
much
damping
of
forehead
,
and
vinegaring
of
temple
,
and
hartshorning
of
nose
,
and
so
forth
;
and
after
most
pathetic
adjuration
from
Miggs
,
assist
by
warm
brandy
-
and
-
water
not
over
-
weak
,
and
diver
other
cordial
,
also
of
a
stimulating
quality
,
administer
at
first
in
teaspoonful
and
afterwards
in
increase
dose
,
and
of
which
Miss
Miggs
herself
partake
as
a
preventive
measure
(
for
fainting
be
infectious
)
;
after
all
these
remedy
,
and
many
more
too
numerous
to
mention
,
but
not
to
take
,
have
be
apply
;
and
many
verbal
consolation
,
moral
,
religious
,
and
miscellaneous
,
have
be
super

thereto
;
the
locksmith
humble

the
end
be

again

the
very
pink
and
pattern
of
good
look

in
a
smart
little
cherry

colour
mantle

with
a
hood
of
the

over
her
head

upon
the
top
of

hood

a
little
straw
hat
trim
with
cherry

colour
ribbon

and
wear
the
mere
trifle
on

side

just
enough
in

to

it
the
wicked

most
provoking
head

dress

malicious
milliner

not

the
manner

these

colour

brighten
her
eye

shed
a

such
impulse
come
over
him
to
decoy
her
into
the
chaise
and
drive
off
like
mad

that
he
would
unquestionably
have
do
it
,
but
for
certain
uneasy
doubt
beset
him
as
to
the
short
way
to
Gretna
Green
;
whether
it
be
up
the
street
or
down
,
or
up
the
right

hand
turning
or
the
left
;
and
whether
,
suppose
all
the
turnpike
to
be
carry
by
storm
,
the
blacksmith
in
the
end
would
marry
them
on
credit
;
which
by
reason
of
his
clerical
office
appear
,
even
to
his
excited
imagination

so
unlikely

that
he
hesitate

while
he
stand
hesitate

look
post

chaise

out
come
his

the
constant
Miggs

and
<EOS>
the
opportunity
be
go
for
ever

<EOS>
for
now
the
chaise
creak
upon
its
spring

and
Mrs

be
inside
;
and
now
it
creak
again
,
and
more
than
ever
,
and
the
locksmith
be
inside
;
and
now
it
bound
once
,
as
if
its
heart
beat
lightly
,
and
Dolly
be
inside
;
and
now
it
be
go
and
its
place
be
empty
,
and
he
and
that
dreary
Miggs
be
stand
in
the
street
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
hearty
locksmith
be
in
as
good
a
humour
as
if
nothing
have
occur
for
the
last
twelve
month
to
put
him
out
of
his
way
,
Dolly
be
all
smile
and
grace
,
and
Mrs

be
agreeable
beyond
all
precedent
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
jog
through
the
street
talk
of
this
thing
and
of
that
,
who
should
be
descry
upon
the
pavement
but
<EOS>
that
very
coachmaker
,
look
so
genteel
that
nobody
would
have
believe
he
have
ever
have
anything
to
do
with
a
coach
but
ride
in
it
,
and
bow
like
any
nobleman
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
dolly
be
confused
when
she
bow
again
,
and
to
be
sure
the
cherry
-
colour
ribbon
tremble
a
little
when
she
meet
his
mournful
eye
,
which
seem
to
say
,
"
I
have
keep
my
word
,
I
have
begin
,
the
business
be
go
to
the
devil
,
and
you

the

it

"
 
<EOS>
there
he
stand
,
root
to
the
ground
:
as
Dolly
say
,
like
a
statue
;
and
as
Mrs
Varden
say
,
like
a
pump
;
till
they
turn
the
corner
:
and
when
her
father
think
it
be
like
his
impudence
,
and
her
mother
wonder
what
he
mean
by
it
,
Dolly
blush
again
till
her
very
hood
be
pale
.
  
<EOS>
but
on
they
go
,
not
the
less
merrily
for
this
,
and
there
be
the
locksmith
in
the
incautious
fulness
of
his
heart
"
pull
-
up
"
at
all
manner
of
place
,
and
evince
a
most
intimate
acquaintance
with
all
the
tavern
on
the
road
,
and
all
the
landlord
and
all
the
landlady
,
with
whom
,
indeed
,
the
little
horse
be
on
equally
friendly
term
,
for
he
keep
on
stop
of
his
own
accord
.
 
<EOS>
never
be
people
so
glad
to
see
other
people
as
these
landlord
and
landlady
be
to
behold
Mr
Varden
and
Mrs
Varden
and
Miss
Varden
;
and
would
not
they
get
out
,
say
one
;
and
they
really
must
walk
upstairs
,
say
another
;
and
she
would
take
it
ill
and
be
quite
certain
they
be
proud
if
they
would
not
have
a
little
taste
of
something
,
say
a
third
;
and
so
on
,
that
it
be
really
quite
a
Progress
rather
than
a
ride
,
and
one
continued
scene
of
hospitality
from
begin
to
end
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
enough
to
be
hold
in
such
esteem
,
not
to
mention
the
refreshment
;
so
Mrs
Varden
say
nothing
at
the
time
,
and
be
all
affability
and
delight
---
but
such
a
body
of
evidence
as
she
collect
against
the
unfortunate
locksmith
that
day
,
to
be
use
thereafter
as
occasion
may
require

never

for
matrimonial
purpose

<EOS>
in

in

of
a
pretty
long
time
too

for
these
agreeable
interruption
delay
them
not
a
little

they
arrive
upon
the
skirt
of
the
Forest

and
ride
pleasantly
on
among
the
tree

come
at
last
to
the

the

cheerful
"
Yoho

<EOS>
speedily
bring
to
the
porch
old
John
,
and
after
him
young
Joe
,
both
of
whom
be
so
transfixed
at
sight
of
the
lady
,
that
for
a
moment
they
be
perfectly
unable
to
give
them
any
welcome

and
could
do
nothing
but
stare

<EOS>
It
be
only
for
a
moment

however

that
Joe
forget
himself

for
speedily

<EOS>
he
thrust
his
drowsy
father
aside

to
Mr
Willet
's
mighty
and
inexpressible
indignation

and
dart
out
,
stand
ready
to
help
them
to
alight
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
for
Dolly
to
get
out
first
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
have
her
in
his
arm
;
---
yes
,
though
for
a
space
of
time
no
longer
than
you
could
count
one

Joe
have
her

his
arm

<EOS>
here
be

It
would
be
difficult
to
describe
what
a
flat
and
commonplace
affair
<EOS>
the
help
Mrs
Varden
out
afterwards
be
,
but
Joe
do
it
,
and
do
it
too
with
the
good
grace
in
the
world

<EOS>
then
old
John

who

entertain
a
dull
and
foggy
sort
of
idea
that
Mrs
Varden
be
not
fond
of
him

have
be
in
some
doubt
whether
she
may
not
have
come
for
purpose
of
assault

battery

take
courage
,
hope
she
be
well

Old

be
heart
in
the
room
;
and
who
that
have
a
heart
,
ever
fail
to
recognise
the
silent
presence
of
another
!
  
<EOS>
dolly
have
one
undoubtedly
,
and
it
be
not
a
tough
one
either
,
though
there
be
a
little
mist
of
coquettishness
about
it
,
such
as
sometimes
surround
that
sun
of
life
in
its
morning
,
and
slightly
dim
its
lustre
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
when
Emma
rise
to
greet
her
,
and
kiss
her
affectionately
on
the
cheek
,
tell
her
,
in
her
quiet
way
,
that
she
have
be
very
unhappy
,
the
tear
stand
in
Dolly
's
eye
,
and
she
feel
more
sorry
than
she
could
tell
;
but
next
moment
she
happen
to
raise
them
to
the
glass
,
and
really
there
be
something
there
so
exceedingly
agreeable
,
that
as
she
sigh
,
she
smile
,
and
feel
surprisingly
console
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
about
it
,
miss
,
"
say
Dolly
,
"
and
it
be
very
sad
indeed
,
but
when
thing
be
at
the
bad
they
be
sure
to
mend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
you
sure
they
be
at
the
bad
?
"
ask
Emma
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
do
not
see
how
they
can
very
well
be
more
unpromising
than
they
be
;
I
really
do
not
,
"
say
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
bring
something
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
from
Edward
?
"
  
dolly
nod
and
smile
,
and
feel
in
her
pocket
(
there
be
pocket
in
those
day
)
with
an
affectation
of
not
be
able
to
find
what
she
want
,
which
greatly
enhance
her
importance
,
at
length
produce
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
as
Emma
hastily
break
the
seal
and
become
absorb
in
its
content
,
Dolly
's
eye
,
by
one
of
those
strange
accident
for
which
there
be
no
accounting
,
wander
to
the
glass
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
wonder
whether
the
coach
-
maker
suffer
very
much
,
and
quite
pity
the
poor
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
letter
---
a
very
long
letter
,
write
close
on
all
four
side
of
the
sheet
of
paper
,
and
cross
afterwards
;
but
it
be
not
a
consolatory
letter
,
for
as
Emma
read
it
<EOS>
she
stop
from
time
to
time
to
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
dolly
marvel
greatly
to
see
her
in
so
much
distress
,
for
to
her
think
a
love
affair
ought
to
be
one
of
the
good
joke
,
and
the
sly
,
merry
kind
of
thing
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
set
it
down
in
her
own
mind
that
all
this
come
from
Miss
Haredale
's
be
so
constant
,
and
that
if
she
would
only
take
on
with
some
other
young
gentleman
---
 
just
in
the
most
innocent
way
possible
,
to
keep
her
first
lover
up
to
the
mark
---
she
would
find
herself
inexpressibly
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
that
be
what
I
should
do
if
it
be
me
,
"
think
dolly
.
<EOS>
"
to
make
one
's
sweetheart
miserable
be
well
enough
and
quite
right
,
but
to
be
make
miserable
one
's
self
be
a
little
too
much
!
"
  
<EOS>
however
it
would
not
do
to
say
so
,
and
therefore
she
sit
look
on
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
She
need
a
pretty
considerable
stretch
of
patience
,
for
when
the
long
letter
have
be
read
once
all
through
it
be
read
again
,
and
when
it
have
be
read
twice
all
through
it
be
read
again
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
tedious
process
,
Dolly
beguile
the
time
in
the
most
improve
manner
that
occur
to
her
,
by
curl
her
hair
on
her
finger
,
with
the
aid
of
the
looking
-
glass
before
mention
,
and
give
it
some
kill
twist
.
  
<EOS>
everything
have
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
even
young
lady
in
love
can
not
read
their
letter
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
in
course
of
time
the
packet
be
fold
up
,
and
it
only
remain
to
write
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
this
promise
to
be
a
work
of
time
likewise
,
Emma
say
she
would
put
it
off
until
after
dinner
,
and
that
Dolly
must
dine
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
Dolly
have
make
up
her
mind
to
do
so
beforehand
,
she
require
very
little
pressing
;
and
when
they
have
settle
this
point
,
they
go
to
walk
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
They
stroll
up
and
down
the
terrace
walk
,
talk
incessantly
---
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
Dolly
never
leave
off
once
---
and
make
that
quarter
of
the
sad
and
mournful
house
quite
gay
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
they
talk
loudly
or
laugh
much
,
but
they
be
both
so
very
handsome
,
and
it
be
such
a
breezy
day
,
and
their
light
dress
and
dark
curl
appear
so
free
and
joyous
in
their
abandonment
,
and
Emma
be
so
fair
,
and
dolly
so
rosy
,
and
Emma
so
delicately
shape
,
and
dolly
so
plump
,
and
<EOS>
---
in
short
,
there
be
no
flower
for
any
garden
like
such
flower
,
<EOS>
let
horticulturist
say
what
they
may
,
and
both
house
and
garden
seem
to
know
it
,
and
to
brighten
up
sensibly
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
come
the
dinner
and
the
letter
writing
,
and
some
more
talk
,
in
the
course
of
which
Miss
Haredale
take
occasion
to
charge
upon
dolly
certain
flirtish
and
inconstant
propensity
,
which
accusation
Dolly
seem
to
think
very
complimentary
indeed
,
and
to
be
mightily
amuse
with
.
 
<EOS>
find
her
quite
incorrigible
in
this
respect
,
Emma
suffer
her
to
depart
;
but
not
before
she
have
confide
to
her
that
important
and
never
-
sufficiently
-
to
-
be
-
take
-
care
-
of
answer
,
and
endow
her
moreover
with
a
pretty
little
bracelet
as
a
keepsake
.
 
<EOS>
have
clasp
it
on
her
arm
,
and
again
advise
her
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
to
amend
her
roguish
way
,
for
she
know
she
be
fond
of
Joe
at
heart
(
which
Dolly
stoutly
deny
,
with
a
great
many
haughty
protestation
that
she
hope
she
could
do
better
than
that
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
so
forth
)
,
she
bid
her
farewell
;
and
after
call
her
back
to
give
her
more
supplementary
message
for
Edward
,
than
anybody
with
tenfold
the
gravity
of
Dolly
Varden
could
be
reasonably
expect
to
remember
,
at
length
dismiss
her
.
  
<EOS>
dolly
bade
her
good
bye
,
and
trip
lightly
down
the
stair
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
dreaded
library
door
,
and
be
about
to
pass
it
again
on
tiptoe
,
when
it
open
,
and
behold
!
<EOS>
there
stand
Mr
Haredale
.
<EOS>
now
,
Dolly
have
from
her
childhood
associate
with
this
gentleman
the
idea
of
something
grim
and
ghostly
,
and
be
at
the
moment
conscience
-
stricken
besides
,
the
sight
of
him
throw
her
into
such
a
flurry
that
she
could
neither
acknowledge
his
presence
nor
run
away
,
so
she
give
a
great
start
,
and
then
with
downcast
eye
stand
still
and
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
"

Mr

dolly

You

anxious

me
detain
you

"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
do
not
let
him
,
nor
do
she
wait
for
him
to
try
,
for
the
word
<EOS>
have
no
sooner
pass
his
lip
than
she
be
out
of
the
room
,
out
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
field
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
to
be
do
,
of
course
,
when
she
come
to
herself
and
consider
what
a
flurry
she
have
be
in
,
be
to
cry
afresh
;
and
the
next
thing
,
when
she
reflect
how
well
she
have
get
over
it
,
be
to
laugh
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
the
tear
once
banish
give
place
to
the
smile
,
and
at
last
dolly
laugh
so
much
that
she
be
fain
to
lean
against
a
tree
,
and
give
vent
to
her
exultation
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
could
laugh
no
longer
,
and
be
quite
tired
,
she
put
her
head
-
dress
to
right
,
dry
her
eye
,
look
back
very
merrily
and
triumphantly
at
the
Warren
chimney
,
which
be
just
visible
,
and
resume
her
walk
.
  
<EOS>
the
twilight
have
come
on
,
and
it
be
quickly
grow
dusk
,
but
the
path
be
so
familiar
to
her
from
frequent
traverse
that
she
hardly
think
of
this
,
and
certainly
feel
no
uneasiness
at
be
leave
alone
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
there
be
the
bracelet
to
admire
;
and
when
she
have
give
it
a
good
rub
,
and
hold
it
out
at
arm
's
length
,
it
sparkle
and
glitter
so
beautifully
on
her
wrist
,
that
to
look
at
it
in
every
point
of
view
and
with
every
possible
turn
of
the
arm
,
be
quite
an
absorbing
business
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
letter
too
,
and
it
look
so
mysterious
and
know
,
when
she
take
it
out
of
her
pocket
,
and
it
hold
,
as
she
know
,
so
much
inside
,
that
to
turn
it
over
and
over
,
and
think
about
it
,
and
wonder
how
it
begin
,
and
how
it
end
,
and
what
it
say
all
through
,
be
another
matter
of
constant
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
between
the
bracelet
and
the
letter
,
there
be
quite
enough
to
do
without
thinking
of
anything
else
;
and
admire
each
by
turn
,
Dolly
go
on
gaily
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
pass
through
a
wicket
-
gate
to
where
the
path
be
narrow
,
and
lie
between
two
hedge
garnish
here
and
there
with
tree
,
she
hear
a
rustling
close
at
hand
,
which
bring
her
to
a
sudden
stop
.
<EOS>
She
listen
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
very
quiet
,
and
she
go
on
again
---
not
absolutely
frightened
,
but
a
little
quick
than
before
perhaps
,
and
possibly
not
quite
so
much
at
her
ease
,
for
a
check
of
that
kind
<EOS>
be
startling
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
sooner
move
on
again
,
than
she
be
conscious
of
the
same
sound
,
which
be
like
that
of
a
person
tramp
stealthily
among
bush
and
brushwood
.
 
<EOS>
look
towards
the
spot
whence
it
appear
to
come
,
she
almost
fancy
she
could
make
out
a
crouching
figure
.
 
<EOS>
She
stop
again
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
quiet
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
on
she
go
once
more
---
decidedly
faster
now
---
and
try
to
sing
softly
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
he
<EOS>
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
come
the
wind
to
blow
only
when
she
walk
,
and
cease
when
she
stand
still
?
 
<EOS>
She
stop
involuntarily
as
she
make
the
reflection
,
and
the
rustle
noise
stop
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
really
frightened
now
,
and
be
yet
hesitate
what
to
do
,
when
the
bush
crackle
and
snap
,
and
a
man
come
plunge
through
them
,
close
before

Chapter
21
    
<EOS>
It
be
for
the
moment
an
inexpressible
relief
to
Dolly
,
to
recognise
in
the
person
who
force
himself
into
the
path
so
abruptly
,
and
now
stand
directly
in
her
way
,
Hugh
of
the
Maypole
,
whose
name
she
utter
in
a
tone
of
delighted
surprise
that
come
from
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
"
how
glad
I
be
to
see
you
!
<EOS>
and
how
could
you
terrify
me
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
in
answer
to
which
,
he
say
nothing
at
all
,
but
stand
quite
still
,
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
come
to
meet
me
?
"
ask
Dolly
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
nod
,
and
mutter
something
to
the
effect
that
he
have
be
wait
for
her
,
and
have
expect
her
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
likely
they
would
send
,
"
say
Dolly
,
greatly
reassure
by
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
send
me
,
"
be
his
sullen
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come
of
my
own
accord
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
rough
bearing
of
this
fellow
,
and
his
wild
,
uncouth
appearance
,
have
often
fill
the
girl
with
a
vague
apprehension
even
when
other
people
be
by
,
and
have
occasion
her
to
shrink
from
him
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
the
have
him
for
an
unbidden
companion
in
so
solitary
a
place
,
with
the
darkness
fast
gather
about
them
,
renew
and
even
increase
the
alarm
she
have
feel
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
if
his
manner
have
be
merely
dog
and
passively
fierce
,
as
usual
,
she
would
have
have
no
great
dislike
to
his
company
than
she
always
feel
---
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
would
have
be
rather
glad
to
have
have
him
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
of
coarse
bold
admiration
in
his
look
,
which
terrify
her
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
She
glance
timidly
towards
him
,
uncertain
whether
to
go
forward
or
retreat
,
and
he
stand
gaze
at
her
like
a
handsome
satyr
;
and
so
they
remain
for
some
short
time
without
stir
or
break
silence
.
<EOS>
at
length
Dolly
take
courage
,
shoot
past
him
,
and
hurry
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
spend
so
much
breath
in
avoid
me
?
"
say
Hugh
,
accommodate
his
pace
to
her
,
and
keep
close
at
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
get
back
as
quickly
as
I
can
,
and
you
walk
too
near
me
,
answer
dolly
.
"
  
"
too
near
!
"
<EOS>
say
Hugh
,
stoop
over
her
so
that
she
could
feel
his
breath
upon
her
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"

too
near

<EOS>
You
be
always
proud

<EOS>
"
I
be
proud
to
no

You

answer
dolly

he
rejoin
,
endeavour
to
draw
her
arm
through
his
,

with
you

<EOS>
She
release
herself
and
clench
her
little
hand
,
strike
him
with
right
good
will
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
,
Maypole
Hugh
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
,
and
pass
his
arm
about
her
waist
,
hold
her
in
his
strong
grasp
as
easily
as
if
she
have
be
a
bird

<EOS>
"
let

go

she
cry
,
endeavour
with
both
her
hand
to
push
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
"

go
this

"
You

Hugh

<EOS>
She
give
him
no
answer
,
but
as
he
have
not
yet
check
her
progress
,
continue
to
press
forward
as
rapidly
as
she
could

<EOS>
at
length

between
the
hurry
she
have
make

her
terror

and
the
tightness
of
his
embrace

her
strength
fail

she

go
no

good
Hugh

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
thoroughly
savage
in
the
manner
of
these
expression
,
and
the
look
and
gesture
by
which
they
be
accompany
,
that
her
great
fear
of
him
give
her
new
strength
,

enable
her
by
a
sudden
effort
to
extricate
herself

fleetly
from

but
Hugh
be
as
nimble

strong
,
and
swift
of
foot
,
as
any
man
in
broad
England
,
and
it
be
but
a
fruitless
expenditure
of
energy

again

shriek
with
the

she

a
shout

with

menacing
look

<EOS>
with
a
great
many
encouraging
expression
and
assurance
of
safety
,
be
the
first
word
Joe
pour
forth
.
<EOS>
but
poor
little
Dolly
be
so
breathless
and
terrify
that
for
some
time
she
be
quite
unable
to
answer
him
,
and
hang
upon
his
shoulder
,
sob
and
cry
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
have
not
the
small
objection
to
have
her
hang
on
his
shoulder
;
<EOS>
no
,
not
the
least
,
though
it
crush
the
cherry
-
colour
ribbon
sadly
,
and
put
the
smart
little
hat
out
of
all
shape
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
bear
to
see
her
cry
;
it
go
to
his
very
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
console
her
,
bent
over
her
,
whisper
to
her
---
some
say
kiss
her
,
but
that
be
a
fable
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
say
all
the
kind
and
tender
thing
he
could
think
of
and
dolly
let
him
go
on
and
do
not
interrupt
him
once
,
and
it
be
a
good
ten
minute
before
she
be
able
to
raise
her
head
and
thank
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
that
frighten
you
?
"
say
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
whose
person
be
unknown
to
her
have
follow
her
,
she
answer
;
he
begin
by
beg
,
and
go
on
to
threat
of
robbery
,
which
he
be
on
the
point
of
carry
into
execution
,
and
would
have
execute
,
but
for
Joe
's
timely
aid
.
 
<EOS>
the
hesitation
and
confusion
with
which
she
say
this
,
Joe
attribute
to
the
fright
she
have
sustain
,
and
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
occur
to
him
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
when
the
word
be
on
your
lip

"
 
<EOS>
a
hundred
time
that
night
,
and
very
often
afterwards
,
when
the
disclosure
be
rise
to
her
tongue
,
dolly
think
of
that
,
and
repress
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
deeply
root
dread
of
the
man
<EOS>
;
the
conviction
that
his
ferocious
nature
,
once
rouse
,
would
stop
at
nothing
;
and
the
strong
assurance
that
if
she
impeach
him
,
the
full
measure
of
his
wrath
and
vengeance
would
be
wreak
on
Joe
,
who
have
preserve
her
;
these
be
consideration
she
have
not
the
courage
to
overcome
,
and
inducement
to
secrecy
too
powerful
for
her
to
surmount
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
,
for
his
part
,
be
a
great
deal
too
happy
to
inquire
very
curiously
into
the
matter
;
and
dolly
be
yet
too
tremulous
to
walk
without
assistance
,
they
go
forward
very
slowly
,
and
in
his
mind
very
pleasantly
,
until
the
Maypole
light
be
near
at
hand
,
twinkle
their
cheerful
welcome
,
when
Dolly
stop
suddenly
and
with
a
half
scream
exclaim
,
  
"
the
letter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
letter
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
carry
---
I
have
it
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
My
bracelet
too

she
say
,
clasp
her
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
lose
them
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
just
now
?
"
say
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
either
I
drop
them
then
,
or
they
be
take
from
me

"
answer
Dolly
,
vainly
search
her
pocket
and
rustle
her
dress
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
go
,
both
go
.
 
<EOS>
what
an
unhappy
girl
I
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
with
these
word
poor
Dolly
,
who
to
do
her
justice
be
quite
as
sorry
for
the
loss
of
the
letter
as
for
her
bracelet
,
fall
a
-
crying
again
,
and
bemoan
her
fate
most
movingly
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
try
to
comfort
her
with
the
assurance
that
directly
he
have
house
her
in
the
Maypole
,
he
would
return
to
the
spot
with
a
lantern
(
for
it
be
now
quite
dark
)
and
make
strict
search
for
the
miss
article
,
which
there
be
great
probability
of
his
finding
,
as
it
be
not
likely
that
anybody
have
pass
that
way
since
,
and
she
be
not
conscious
that
they
have
be
forcibly
take
from
her
.
<EOS>
dolly
thank
him
very
heartily
for
this
offer
,
though
with
no
great
hope
of
his
quest
be
successful
;
and
so
with
many
lamentation
on
her
side
,
and
many
hopeful
word
on
his
,
and
much
weakness
on
the
part
of
Dolly
and
much
tender
support
on
the
part
of
Joe
,
they
reach
the
Maypole
bar
at
last
,
where
the
locksmith
and
his
wife
and
old
John
be
yet
keep
high
festival
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
receive
the
intelligence
of
Dolly
's
trouble
with
that
surprising
presence
of
mind
and
readiness
of
speech
for
which
he
be
so
eminently
distinguish
above
all
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
express
her
sympathy
for
her
daughter
's
distress
by
scold
her
roundly
for
be
so
late
;
and
the
honest
locksmith
divide
himself
between
condole
with
and
kiss
dolly
,
and
shake
hand
heartily
with
Joe
,
whom
he
could
not
sufficiently
praise
or
thank
.
  
<EOS>
in
reference
to
this
latter
point
,
old
John
be
far
from
agree
with
his
friend
;
for
besides
that
he
by
no
mean
approve
of
an
adventurous
spirit
in
the
abstract
,
it
occur
to
him
that
if
his
son
and
heir
have
be
seriously
damage
in
a
scuffle
,
the
consequence
would
assuredly
have
be
expensive
and
inconvenient
,
and
may
perhaps
have
prove
detrimental
to
the
Maypole
business
.
<EOS>
wherefore
,
and
because
he
look
with
no
favourable
eye
upon
young
girl
,
but
rather
consider
that
they
and
the
whole
female
sex
be
a
kind
of
nonsensical
mistake
on
the
part
of
Nature
,
he
take
occasion
to
retire
and
shake
his
head
in
private
at
the
boiler
;
inspire
by
which
silent
oracle
,
he
be
move
to
give
Joe
various

<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
opine
that
if
he
do
,
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
;
such
sentiment
be
more
consistent
(
so
she
argue
)
with
a
benighted
Mussulman
or
wild
Islander
than
with
a
stanch
Protestant
.
 
<EOS>
argue
from
this
imperfect
state
of
his
moral
,
Mrs
Varden
further
opine
that
he
have
never
study
the
Manual
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
admit
that
he
never
have
,
and
moreover
that
he
could
not
read
,
Mrs
Varden
declare
with
much
severity
,
that
he
ought
to
he
even
more
ashamed
of
himself
than
before
,
and
strongly
recommend
him
to
save
up
his
pocket
-
money
for
the
purchase
of
one

and
further
to
teach
himself
the
content
with
all
convenient
diligence

<EOS>
She

this
train
of
discourse

when
Hugh

somewhat
unceremoniously
and
irreverently
,
follow
his
young
master
out
,
and
leave
her
to
edify
the
rest
of
the
company

<EOS>
this

to
do

deep
attention

the
whole
of
her
discourse
to
him

whom
she
entertain
with
a
moral
and
theological
lecture
of
considerable
length

in
the
conviction
that
great
working
be
take
place
in
his
spirit

<EOS>
the
simple
truth
be
,
however
,
that
Mr

,
although
his
eye
be
wide
open

he
see
a
woman
before
him
whose

by
long

until
his

cause
him
to
wake
up
with
a
deep
sigh
,
and
a
faint
impression
that
he
have
be
dream
about
pickle
pork
and
green
---
 
a
vision
of
his
slumber
which
be
no
doubt
referable
to
the
circumstance
of
Mrs
Varden

have
frequently
pronounce
the
word
"
grace

with
much
emphasis
;
which
word

Chapter

<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
bright
night
,
and
for
all
her
lowness
of
spirit
<EOS>
dolly
keep
look
up
at
the
star
in
a
manner
so
bewitch
<EOS>
(
and
SHE
know
it
!
)
<EOS>
that
Joe
be
clean
out
of
his
sense
,
and
plainly
show
that
if
ever
a
man
be
---
not
to
say
over
head
and
ear
,
but
over
the
Monument
and
the
top
of
Saint
Paul
's
in
love
,
that
man
be
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
road
be
a
very
good
one
;
not
at
all
a
jolt
road
,
or
an
uneven
one
;
and
yet
dolly
hold
the
side
of
the
chaise
with
one
little
hand
,
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
an
executioner
behind
him
with
an
uplifted
axe
ready
to
chop
off
his
head
if
he
touch
that
hand
,
Joe
could
not
have
help
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
from
put
his
own
hand
upon
it
as
if
by
chance
,
and
take
it
away
again
after
a
minute
or
so
,
he
get
to
ride
along
without
take
it
off
at
all
;
as
if
he
,
the
escort
,
be
bind
to
do
that
as
an
important
part
of
his
duty
,
and
have
come
out
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
curious
circumstance
about
this
little
incident
be
,
that
Dolly
do
not
seem
to
know
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
so
innocent
and
unconscious
when
she
turn
her
eye
on
Joe
,
that
it
be
quite
provoking
.
  
<EOS>
She
talk
though
;
talk
about
her
fright
,
and
about
Joe
's
come
up
to
rescue
her
,
and
about
her
gratitude
,
and
about
her
fear
that
she
may
not
have
thank
him
enough
,
and
about
their
always
be
friend
from
that
time
forth
---
and
about
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
and
when
Joe
say
,
not
friend
he
hope
,
Dolly
be
quite
surprised
,
and
say
not
enemy
she
hope
;
and
when
Joe
say
,
could
not
they
be
something
much
well
than
either
,
dolly
all
of
a
sudden
find
out
a
star
which
be
bright
than
all
the
other
star
,
and
beg
to
call
his
attention
to
the
same
,
and
be
ten
thousand
time
more
innocent
and
unconscious
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
they
travel
along
,
talk
very
little
above
a
whisper
,
and
wish
the
road
could
be
stretch
out
to
some
dozen
time
its
natural
length
---
at
least
that
be
Joe
's
desire
---
<EOS>
when
,
as
they
be
get
clear
of
the
forest
and
emerge
on
the
more
frequented
road
,
they
hear
behind
them
the
sound
of
a
horse
's
foot
at
a
round
trot
,
which
grow
rapidly
louder
as
it
draw
near
,
elicit
a
scream
from
Mrs
Varden
,
and
the
cry
"
a
friend
!
"
<EOS>
from
the
rider
,
who
now
come
pant
up
,
and
check
his
horse
beside
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
man
again
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Dolly
,
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hugh

"
say
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
errand
be
you
upon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
ride
back
with
you
,

he

covertly
at

<EOS>
"
he
send
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
!
"
say
poor
Joe
;
add
under
his
breath
,
with
a
very
unfilial
apostrophe
,
"
Will
he
never
think
me
man
enough
to
take
care
of
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
!
"
return
Hugh
to
the
first
part
of
the
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
road
be
not
safe
just
now
,
he
say
,
and
you
would
better
have
a
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
ride
on
then
,
"
say
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
turn
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
comply
,
and
they
go
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
whim
or
humour
to
ride
immediately
before
the
chaise
,
and
from
this
position
he
constantly
turn
his
head
,
and
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
feel
that
he
look
at
her
,
but
she
avert
her
eye
and
fear
to
raise
them
once
,
so
great
be
the
dread
with
which
he
have
inspire
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
interruption
,
and
the
consequent
wakefulness
of
Mrs
Varden
,
who
have
be
nod
in
her
sleep
up
to
this
point
,
except
for
a
minute
or
two
at
a
time
,
when
she
rouse
herself
to
scold
the
locksmith
for
audaciously
take
hold
of
her
to
prevent
her
nodding
herself
out
of
the
chaise
,
put
a
restraint
upon
the
whisper
conversation
,
and
make
it
difficult

with

bury

cry
very
much

<EOS>
at
first
sight

(
for
Dolly

by
no

accustomed
to
display

rather
learn
from
her
mother

example
to
avoid

as
much
as

<EOS>
Mrs

express
her
belief
that
never
be
any
woman
so
beset
as

that
her
life
be
a
continued
scene
of
trial
;
that
whenever
she
be
dispose
to
be
well
and
cheerful
,
so
sure
be
the
people
around
her
to
throw
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
a
damp
upon
her
spirit
;
and
that
,
as
she
have
enjoy
herself
that
day
,
and
Heaven
know
it
be
very
seldom
she
do
enjoy
herself
<EOS>
so
she
be
now
to
pay
the
penalty

<EOS>
to
all
such
proposition
Miggs
assent
freely

<EOS>
Poor
Dolly
,
however
,
grow
none
the
well
for
these
restorative
,
but
rather
bad
,
indeed
;
and
see
that
she
be
really
ill
,
both
Mrs
Varden
and
Miggs
be
move
to
compassion
,
and
tend
her
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
but
even
then
,
their
very
kindness
shape
itself
into
their
usual
course
of
policy
,
and
though
Dolly
be
in
a
swoon
,
it
be
render
clear
to
the
mean
capacity
,
that
Mrs
Varden
be
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
thus
when
Dolly
begin
to
get
a
little
well
,
and
pass
into
that
stage
in
which
matron
hold
that
remonstrance
and
argument
may

successfully
apply

her
mother
represent
to
her

with
tear

that
if
she
have

that
day

she
must
remember
it
be
the
common
lot
of
humanity

who
through

resignation

<EOS>
Mrs

entreat
her
to
remember
that
one
of

day
she
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
to
do
violence
to
her
feeling
so
far
as
to
be

and
that
marriage
,
as
she
may
see
every

in

<EOS>
Miss

also
put
in

<EOS>
She

indeed
and
indeed
Miss

may
take
pattern
by
her
bless

who

she

have
work
such
a
wholesome
change
in
the
mind
of
her

in

,
that

whereas
,
before

she
and

like

the
habit
of
exchange
brass

other
such
strong

they

<EOS>
after

at
herself
as
a
comparatively
worthless
vessel

but
still
as
one
of
some
desert
,
she
beseech
her
to
bear
in
mind
that
her
aforesaid
<EOS>
dear
and
only
mother
be
of
a
weakly
constitution
and
excitable
temperament
,
who
have
constantly
to
sustain
affliction
in

life

compare
with
which
thief

robber
be
as
nothing

yet
never
sink
down

give
way
to
despair

wrath

,
in

always
come
up
to
time
with
a
cheerful
countenance

and
go
in
to

<EOS>
when
Miggs
finish
her
solo
,
her
mistress
strike
in
again
,
and
the
two
together
perform
a
duet
to
the
same
purpose
;
the
burden
be
,
that
Mrs
Varden
be
persecute
perfection
,
and
Mr
Varden
,
as
the
representative
of
mankind
in
that
apartment
,
a
creature
of
vicious
and
brutal
habit
,
utterly
insensible
to
the
blessing
he
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
of
so
refine
a
character
,
indeed
,
be
their
talent
of
assault
under
the
mask
of
sympathy
,
that
when
Dolly
,
recover
,
embrace
her
father
tenderly
,
as
in
vindication
of
his
goodness
,
Mrs
Varden
express
her
solemn
hope
that
this
would
be
a
lesson
to
him
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
,
and
that
he
would
do
some
little
justice
to
a
woman

nature
ever
afterwards

in
which
aspiration
Miss

by

sniff
and

more
significant
than
the
long
oration

express
her
entire
concurrence

<EOS>
but
the
great
joy
of
Miggs

heart

what
have
happen

Ned

I
find
some

the

with

Hugh
would
have
answer
him
that

questioner
himself
have

in

the

lead
him

manage
the
whole

perfectly
baffle
him

He
do
not
doubt
that
if
he
have
make
the
retort
which
be
on
his
lip
when
Mr

turn
round
and
question
him
so
keenly
,
he
would
straightway
have
give
him
into
custody
and
have
him
drag
before
a
justice
with
the
steal
property
upon
him
;
in
which
case
it
be
as
certain
he
would
have

hang

<EOS>
the
ascendency
which
it
be
the
purpose

the
man

establish
over

savage
instrument

be
gain
from
that
time

<EOS>
Hugh
's
submission
be
complete
.
 
<EOS>
He
dread
him
beyond
description
;

feel
that
accident

artifice
have
spin
a
web
about
him
,
which
at
a
touch
from
such
a
master

hand
as
his
,
would
bind
him
to
the
gallow
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
thought
pass
through
his
mind
,
and
yet
wonder
at
the
very
same
time
how
he
who
come
there
rioting
in
the
confidence
of
this
man
(
as
he
think
)
,
should
be
so
soon
<EOS>

so
thoroughly
subdue
,
Hugh
stand
cower
before
him

regard
him
uneasily
from
time
to
time
,
while
he
finish
dress
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
so
,
he
take
up
the
letter

break
the
seal
,

throw
himself
back
in
his
chair

read
it
leisurely
through

very
neatly
word

all
that
sort

"
  
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
twist
it
up
,
and
glance
lazily
round
at
Hugh
as
though
he
would
say
"
You
see

"
hold
it
in
the
flame
of
the
candle

when

it
into

there
it
smoulder
away

"
It
be
direct

,
turn
to
Hugh
,

you
do
quite
right
to
bring

here

I
open
it
on

this

<EOS>
Hugh
step
forward
to
receive
the
piece
of
money
he
hold
out
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
put
it
in
his
hand
,
he
add
:
  
"

anything
else

this
be

with
a
smile

imply

Hugh
think
it
do

"
fail

He
answer
that
he
would

<EOS>
"

do
not

say
his

with
an
air
of

very

uneasy

<EOS>
Hugh
accept
it
from
his

and
look
stealthily
at
his
smile
face
,
drank
the
content
in
silence

creep
out

so
different

with

wearily
along
;
while
Barnaby
,
yield
to
every
inconstant
impulse
,
flutter
here
and
there
,
now
leave
her
far
behind
,
now
linger
far
behind
himself
,
now
dart
into
some
by
-
lane
or
path
and
leave
her
to
pursue
her
way
alone
,
until
he
stealthily
emerge
again
and
come
upon
her
with
a
wild
shout
of
merriment
,
as
his
wayward
and
capricious
nature
prompt
.
 
<EOS>
now
he
would
call
to
her
from
the
topmost
branch
of
some
high
tree
by
the
roadside
;
now
use
his
tall
staff
as
a
leaping
-
pole
,
come
fly
over
ditch
or
hedge
or
five
-
bar
gate
;
now
run
with
surprising
swiftness
for
a
mile
or
more
on
the
straight
road
,
and
halting
,
sport
upon
a
patch
of
grass
with
Grip
till
she
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
his
delight
;
and
when
his
patient
mother
hear
his
merry
voice
,
or
look
into
his
flushed
and
healthy
face
,
she
would
not
have
abate
them
by
one
sad
word
or
murmur
,
though
each
have
be
to
her
a
source
of
suffer
in
the
same
degree
as
it
be
to
him
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
something
to
look
upon
enjoyment
,
so
that
it
be
free
and
wild
and
in
the
face
of
nature
,
though
it
be
but
the
enjoyment
of
an
idiot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
something
to
know
that
Heaven
have
leave
the
capacity
of
gladness
in
such
a
creature
's
breast
;
it
be
something
to
be
assure
that
,
however
lightly
man
may
crush
that
faculty
in
their
fellow
,
the
Great
Creator
of
mankind
impart
it
even
to
his
despised
and
slighted
work
.
 
<EOS>
who
would
not
rather
see
a
poor
idiot
happy
in
the
sunlight
,
than
a
wise
man
pine
in
a
darken
jail
!
  
<EOS>
ye
man
of
gloom
and
austerity
,
who
paint
the
face
of
Infinite
Benevolence
with
an
eternal
frown
;
read
in
the
Everlasting
Book
,
wide
open
to
your
view
,
the
lesson
it
would
teach
.
 
<EOS>
Its
picture
be
not
in
black
and
sombre
hue
,
but
bright
and
glowing
tint
;
its
music
---
save
when
ye
drown
it
---
be
not
in
sigh
and
groan
,
but
song
and
cheerful
sound
.
 
<EOS>
listen
to
the
million
voice
in
the
summer
air
,
and
find
one
dismal
as
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
remember
,
if
ye
can
,
the
sense
of
hope
and
pleasure
which
every
glad
return
of
day
awaken
in
the
breast
of
all
your
kind
who
have
not
change
their
nature
;
and
learn
some
wisdom
even
from
the
witless
,
when
their
heart
be
lift
up
they
know
not
why
,
by
all
the
mirth
and
happiness
it
bring

<EOS>
the
widow
's
breast
be
full
of
care
,
be
laden
heavily
with
secret
dread
and
sorrow
;
but
her
boy
's
gaiety
of
heart
gladden
her
,
and
beguile
the
long
journey
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
would
bid
her
lean
upon
his
arm
,
and
would
keep
beside
her
steadily
for
a
short
distance
;
but
it
be
more
his
nature
to
be
ramble
to
and
fro
,
and
she
better
like
to
see
him
free
and
happy
,
even
than
to
have
him
near
her
,
because
she
love
him
better
than
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
quit
the
place
to
which
they
be
travel
,
directly
after
the
event
which
have
change
her
whole
existence
;
and
for
two
-
and
-
twenty
year
have
never
have
courage
to
revisit
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
her
native
village
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
recollection
crowd
on
her
mind
when
it
appear
in
sight
!
  
<EOS>
two
-
and
-
twenty
year
.
 
<EOS>
Her
boy
's
whole
life
and
history
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
time
she
look
back
upon
those
roof
among
the
tree
,
she
carry
him
in
her
arm
,
an
infant
.
 
<EOS>
how
often
since
that
time
have
she
sit
beside
him
night
and
day
,
watch
for
the
dawn
of
mind
that
never
come
;
how
have
she
fear
,
and
doubt
,
and
yet
hope
,
long
after
conviction
force
itself
upon
her
!
 
<EOS>
the
little
stratagem
she
have
devise
to
try
him
<EOS>
,
the
little
token
he
have
give
in
his
childish
way
---
not
of
dulness
but
of
something
infinitely
bad
,
<EOS>
so
ghastly
and
unchildlike
in
its
cunning
---
come
back
as
vividly
as
if
but
yesterday
have
intervene
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
they
use
to
be
;
the
spot
in
which
his
cradle
stand
;
he
,
old
and
elfin
-
like
in
face
,
but
ever
dear
to
her
,
gaze
at
her
with
a
wild
and
vacant
eye
,
and
croon
some
uncouth
song
as
she
sit
by
and
rock
him
;
every
circumstance
of
his
infancy
come
throng
back
,
and
the
most
trivial
,
perhaps
,
the
most
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
His
old
childhood
,
too
;
the
strange
imagining
he
have
;
his
terror
of
certain
senseless
thing
---
familiar
object
he
endow
with
life
;
the
slow
and
gradual
breaking
out
of
that
one
horror
,
in
which
,
before
his
birth
,
his
darken
intellect
begin
;
how
,
in
the
midst
of
all
,
she
have
find
some
hope
and
comfort
in
his
being
unlike
another
child
,
and
have
go
on
almost
believe
in
the
slow
development
of
his
mind
until
he
grow
a
man
,
and
then
his
childhood
be
complete
and
lasting
;
one
after
another
,
all
these
old
thought
spring
up
within
her
,
strong
after
their
long
slumber
and
bitterer
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
She
take
his
arm
and
they
hurry
through
the
village
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
as
it
be
will
not
to
be
in
old
time
,
yet
different
too
,
and
wear
another
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
change
be
in
herself
,
not
it
;
but
she
never
think
of
that
,
and
wonder
at
its
alteration
,
and
where
it
lie
,
and
what
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
all
know
Barnaby

the
child
of
the
place
come
flock
round
him

as
she

some
silly
beggarman

I

<EOS>
ask
me
no

believe
that
I

rather
to

I
must
leave

morrow

<EOS>
My

dwelling

if
I

if

do
not

off

I

you

you

dear
Miss

too

to
trust
me
if
you
can
,

think
of
me
kindly

you
have
be
use

do

<EOS>
if
I
die
and
can
not
tell
my
secret
even
then
(
for
that
may
come
to
pass
)
,
it
will
sit
the
light
on
my
breast
in

hour

this
day

work

on
that
day

every
day

it
come

I
will
pray
for

thank
you
both

trouble
you
no

<EOS>
with
that
,
she
would
have
leave
them
,
but
they
detain
her
,
and
with
many
soothing
word
and
kind
entreaty
,
besought
her
to
consider
what
she
do
,
and
above
all
to
repose
more
freely
upon
them
,
and
say
what
weigh
so
sorely
on
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
find
her
deaf
to
their
persuasion
,
Mr
Haredale
suggest
,
as
a
last
resource
,
that
she
should
confide
in
Emma
,
of
whom
,
as
a
young
person
and
one
of
her
own
sex
,
she
may
stand
in
less
dread
than
of
himself
.
<EOS>
from
this
proposal
,
however
,
she
recoil
with
the
same
indescribable
repugnance
she
have
manifest
when
they
meet
.
 
<EOS>
the
utmost
that
could
be
wrung
from
her
be
,
a
promise
that
she
would
receive
Mr
Haredale
at
her
own
house
next
evening
,
and
in
the
mean
time
reconsider
her
determination
and
their
dissuasion
---
though
any
change
on
her
part
,
as
she
tell
them
,
be
quite
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
this
condition
make
at
last
,
they
reluctantly
suffer
her
to
depart
,
since
she
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
within
the
house
;
and
she
,
and
Barnaby
,
and
Grip
,
accordingly
go
out
as
they
have
come
,
by
the
private
stair
and
garden
-
gate
;
see
and
be
see
of
no
one
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
in
the
raven
that
during
the
whole
interview
he
have
keep
his
eye
on
his
book
with
exactly
the
air
of
a
very
sly
human
rascal
,
who
,
under
the
mask
of
pretend
to
read
hard
,
be
listen
to
everything
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
appear
to
have
the
conversation
very
strongly
in
his
mind
,
for
although
,
when
they
be
alone
again
,
he
issue
order
for
the
instant
preparation
of
innumerable
kettle
for
purpose
of
tea
,
he
be
thoughtful
,
and
rather
seem
to
do
so
from
an
abstract
sense
of
duty
,
than
with
any
regard
to
make
himself
agreeable
,
or
be
what
be
commonly
call
good
company
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
to
return
by
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
as
there
be
an
interval
of
full
two
hour
before
it
start
,
and
they
need
rest
and
some
refreshment
,
Barnaby
beg
hard
for
a
visit
to
the
Maypole
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
mother
,
who
have
no
wish
to
be
recognise
by
any
of
those
who
have
know
her
long
ago
,
and
who
fear
besides
that
Mr
Haredale
may
,
on
second
thought
,
despatch
some
messenger
to
that
place
of
entertainment
in
quest
of
her
,
propose
to
wait
in
the
churchyard
instead
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
easy
for
Barnaby
to
buy
and
carry
thither
such
humble
viand
as
they
require
,
he
cheerfully
assent
,
and
in
the
churchyard
they
sit
down
to
take
their
frugal
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
here
again
,
the
raven
be
in
a
highly
reflective
state
;
walk
up
and
down
when
he
have
dine
,
with
an
air
of
elderly
complacency
which
be
strongly
suggestive
of
his
have
his
hand
under
his
coat
-
tail
;
and
appear
to
read
the
tombstone
with
a
very
critical
taste
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
after
a
long
inspection
of
an
epitaph
,
he
would
strop
his
beak
upon
the
grave
to
which
it
refer
,
and
cry
in
his
hoarse
tone
,
"
I
be
a
devil
,
I
be
a
devil
,
I
be
a
devil
!
"
<EOS>
but
whether
he
address
his
observation
to
any
suppose
person
below
,
or
merely
throw
them
off
as
a
general
remark
,
be
matter
of
uncertainty
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
quiet
pretty
spot
,
but
<EOS>
a
sad
one
for
Barnaby
's
mother
;
for
Mr
Reuben
Haredale
lie
there
,
and
near
the
vault
in
which
his
ashe
rest
,
be
a
stone
to
the
memory
of
her
own
husband
,
with
a
brief
inscription
record
<EOS>
how
and
when
he
have
lose
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
here
,
thoughtful
and
apart
,
until
their
time
be
out
,
and
the
distant
horn
tell
that
the
coach
be
come
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
who
have
be
sleep
on
the
grass
,
spring
up
quickly
at
the
sound
;
and
Grip
,
who
appear
to
understand
it
equally
well
,
walk
into
his
basket
straightway
,
entreat
society
in
general
(
as
though
he
intend
a
kind
of
satire
upon
them
in
connection
with
churchyard
)
never
to
say
die
on
any
term
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
soon
on
the
coach
-
top
and
roll
along
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
It
go
round
by
the
Maypole
,
and
stop
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
be
from
home
,
and
Hugh
come
sluggishly
out
to
hand
up
the
parcel
that
it
call
for
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
fear
of
old
John
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
see
him
from
the
coach
-
roof
fast
asleep
in
his
cosy
bar
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
John
's
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
point
of
go
to
sleep
at
the
coach
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
despise
gad
about
;
he
look
upon
coach
as
thing
that
ought
to
be
indict
;
as
disturber
of
the
peace
of
mankind
;
as
restless
,
bustling
,
busy
,
horn
-
blow
contrivance
,
quite
beneath
the
dignity
of
man
,
and
only
suit
to
giddy
girl
that
do
nothing
but
chatter
and
go
a
-
shopping
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
nothing

John

say
,
if
any
unlucky

the
offensive
vehicle

rather
not

more

be
worth

with
their
noise
and
rattle

<EOS>
if
you
like
to
wait
for
'em
you
can
;
but
we
do
not
know
anything
about
'em
;
they
may
call
and
they
may
not

there
be

She
drop
her
veil
as
Hugh
climb
up
,
and
while
he
hang
behind
,
and
talk
to
Barnaby
in
whisper

but
neither
he
nor
any
other
person
speak
to
her
,
or
notice
her
,
or

any
curiosity
about
her

so

an
alien

she
visit

leave
the

she
have
be
bear
,
and
have
live
a
merry
child

a
comely

a
happy

where
she

show
his
visitor
on

<EOS>
Mr

have
call
upon
him
to
entreat
his
company
to
the
widow

that
he
may

the

"
I
forbore
,
"

Gabriel

"
from
repeat
one
word
of

to
anybody

as
it
could
do

no

may
do
her
great
harm

<EOS>
I
think
and
hope
,
to
say
the
truth
,
that
she
would
come
to
me
,
and
talk
to
me
about
it
,
and
tell
me
how
it
be
;
but
though
I
have
purposely
put
myself
in
her
way
more
than
once
or
twice
,
she
have
never
touch
upon
the
subject

except
by
a
look

<EOS>

indeed
,
"
say
the
good

natured
locksmith

there
be
a
good
deal
in
the
look

more
than
could
have
be
put
into
a

many
word

<EOS>
It
say
among
other
matter
"
do
not
ask
me
anything
"
so
imploringly
,
that
I
do
not
ask
her
anything

<EOS>
You
will
think
me
an
old
fool
,
I
know

what
meaning

shake
his

"
not

She
may
have
do
so
,
in
the
fear
that
it
would
lead
,
if
know

to
some
objection

estrangement

<EOS>
suppose
she
marry
incautiously

<EOS>
it
be
not
improbable

existence
have
be
a
lonely

monotonous
one

the
man
turn
out
a
ruffian

would
be
anxious

screen
him

would
revolt
from
his
crime

this
may
be

It
bear
strongly
on

repair
to

coffee

house
in
Covent
Garden
<EOS>
when
he
leave
the
locksmith
's
,
Mr
Chester
sit
long
over
a
late
dinner
,
entertain
himself
exceedingly
with
the
whimsical
recollection
of
his
recent
proceeding
,
and
congratulate
himself
very
much
on
his
great
cleverness
.

influence
by
these
thought
,
his
face
wear
an
expression
so
benign
and
tranquil
,
that
the
waiter
in
immediate
attendance
upon
him
feel
he
could
almost
have
die
in
his
defence
,
and
settle
in
his
own
mind
(
until
the
receipt
of
the
bill
,
and
a
very
small
fee
for
very
great
trouble
disabuse
it
of
the
idea
)
that
such
an
apostolic
customer
be
worth
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
the
ordinary
run
of
visitor
,
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
a
visit
to
the
gaming
-
table
---
not
as
a
heated
,
anxious
venturer
,
but
one
whom
it
be
quite
a
treat
to
see
stake
his
two
or
three
piece
in
deference
to
the
folly
of
society
,
and
smile
with
equal
benevolence
on
winner
and
loser
---
make
it
late
before
he
reach
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
custom
to
bid
his
servant
<EOS>
go
to
bed
at
his
own
time
unless
he
have
order
to
the
contrary
,
and
to
leave
a
candle
on
the
common
stair
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
lamp
on
the
landing
by
which
he
could
always
light
it
when
he
come
home
late
,
and
have
a
key
of
the
door
about
him
he
could
enter
and
go
to
bed
at
his
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
He
open
the
glass
of
the
dull
lamp
,
whose
wick
,
burn
up
and
swell
like
a
drunkard
's
nose
,
come
fly
off
in
little
carbuncle
at
the
candle
's
touch
,
and
scatter
hot
spark
about
,
render
it
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
kindle
the
lazy
taper
;
when
a
noise
,
as
of
a
man
snore
deeply
some
step
high
up
,
cause
him
to
pause
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
heavy
breathing
of
a
sleeper
,
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
some
fellow
have
lain
down
on
the
open
staircase
,
and
be
slumber
soundly
.
 
<EOS>
have
light
the
candle
at
length
and
open
his
own
door
,
he
softly
ascend
,
hold
the
taper
high
above
his
head
,
and
peer
cautiously
about
;
curious
to
see
what
kind
of
man
have
choose
so
comfortless
a
shelter
for
his
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
with
his
head
upon
the
landing
and
his
great
limb
fling
over
half
-
a
-
dozen
stair
,
as
carelessly
as
though
he
be
a
dead
man
whom
drunken
bearer
have
throw
down
by
chance
,
there
lie
Hugh
,
face
uppermost
,
his
long
hair
droop
like
some
wild
weed
upon
his
wooden
pillow
,
and
his
huge
chest
heave
with
the
sound
which
so
unwontedly
disturb
the
place
and
hour
.
  
<EOS>
He
who
come
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
be
about
to
break
his
rest
by
thrust
him
with
his
foot
,
when
,
glance
at
his
upturned
face
,
he
arrest
himself
in
the
very
action
,
and
stoop
down
and
shade
the
candle
with
his
hand
,
examine
his
feature
closely
.
<EOS>
close
as
his
first
inspection
be
,
it
do
not
suffice
,
for
he
pass
the
light
,
still
carefully
shade
as
before
,
across
and
across
his
face
,
and
yet
observe
him
with
a
search
eye
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
engage
,
the
sleeper
,
without
any
start
or
turn
round
,
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
kind
of
fascination
in
meet
his
steady
gaze
so
suddenly
,
which
take
from
the
other
the
presence
of
mind
to
withdraw
his
eye
,
and
force
him
,
as
it
be
,
to
meet
his
look
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
remain
stare
at
each
other
,
until
Mr
Chester
at
last
broke
silence
,
and
ask
him
in
a
low
voice
,
why
he
lie
sleep
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
Hugh
,
struggle
into
a
sit
posture
and
gaze
at
him
intently
,
still
,
"
that
you
be
a
part
of
my
dream
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
curious
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
never
come
true

"
what

He
look
round
him
as
he
speak

in
particular
look
above
his
head
,
as
though
he
half
expect
to

under
some
object
which
have

<EOS>
then

follow

conductor
into

Mr

It
be
natural
it
should
break
out

when

you
must
,
for
your

be
as

You

"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
understand
him
perfectly

<EOS>
after
a
pause
he
mutter
that
he
hope
his
patron
would
involve
him
in
no
trouble
about
this
last
letter
;
for
he
have
keep
it
back
solely
with
the
view
of
please
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
continue
in
this
strain
,
when
Mr
Chester
with
a
most
beneficent
and
patronising
air
cut
him
short
by
say
:
  
"
My
good
fellow
,
you
have
my
promise
,
my
word
,
my
seal
bond
(
for
a
verbal
pledge
with
me
be
quite
as
good
)
,
that
I
will
always
protect
you
so
long
as
you
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
do
set
your
mind
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
keep
it
at
ease
,
I
beg
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
man
put
himself
in
my
power
so
thoroughly
as
you
have
do
,
I
really
feel
as
though
he
have
a
kind
of
claim
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
more
disposed
to
mercy
and
forbearance
under
such
circumstance
than
I
can
tell
you
,
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
do
look
upon
me
as
your
protector
,
and
rest
assure
<EOS>
,
I
entreat
you
,
that
on
the
subject
of
that
indiscretion
,
you
may
preserve
,
as
long
as
you
and
I
be
friend
,
the
light
heart
that
ever
beat
within
a
human
breast
.
 
<EOS>
fill
that
glass
once
more
to
cheer
you
on
your
road
homeward
---
I
be
really
quite
ashamed
to
think
how
far
you
have
to
go
---
and
then
God
bless
you
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
think
,
"
say
Hugh
,
when
he
have
toss
the
liquor
down
,
"
that
I
be
sleep
soundly
in
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
ha
ha
ha

<EOS>
the
stable
door
be
shut

the
steed
be
go

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
most
convivial
fellow
,
"
return
his
friend
,
"
and
I
love
your
humour
of
all
thing
.
 
<EOS>
good
night
!
 
<EOS>
take
the
great
possible
care
of
yourself
,
for
my
sake
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
that
during
the
whole
interview
,
each
have
endeavour
to
catch
steal
glance
of
the
other
's
face
,
and
have
never
look
full
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
interchange
one
brief
and
hasty
glance
as
Hugh
go
out
,
avert
their
eye
directly
,
and
so
separated
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
close
the
double
door
behind
him
,
carefully
and
without
noise
;
and
Mr
Chester
remain
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
with
his
gaze
intently
fix
upon
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
after
meditate
for
a
long
time
---
and
say
with
a
deep
sigh
and
an
uneasy
shifting
of
his
attitude
,
as
though
he
dismiss
some
other
subject
from
his
thought
,
and
return
to
that
which
have
hold
possession
of
them
all
the
day
---
the
plot
thicken
;
I
have
throw
the
shell
;
it
will
explode
,
I
think
,
in
eight
-
and
-
forty
hour
,
and
should
scatter
these
good
folk
amazingly
.
 
<EOS>
We

up

in
a
strange
voice

very
different
from

the

strong

be
so
full
of

vague
terror

They

have
quite

<EOS>
but
the
reflection
of
their

great
wisdom

<EOS>
It
be
curious
to
imagine
these
people
of
the
world
,
busy
in
thought
,
turn
their
eye
towards
the
countless
sphere
that
shine
above
us

and
make

reflect
the

the

in
the

between

so
do
the
shadow
of
our
own
desire
stand
between
us
and
our
well
angel
,
and
thus
their
brightness
be
eclipse

<EOS>
everything
be
fresh
and
gay

as
though
the

be

that
morning
make

when
Mr

ride
at

tranquil
pace
along
the
Forest
road
.
 
<EOS>
though
early
in

it
be
warm
and
genial
weather
;
the
tree
be
bud
into
leaf
,
the
hedge
and
the
grass
be
green
,
the
air
be
musical
with
song
of
bird
,
and
high
above
them
<EOS>
all
the
lark
pour
out
her
rich
melody

<EOS>
in
shady
spot
,
the
morning
dew
sparkle
on

young
leaf

blade
of
grass
;
and
where
the
sun
be
shine
,
some
diamond
drop
yet
glisten
brightly
,
as
in
unwillingness
to
leave
so
fair
a
world
,
and
have
such
brief
existence
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
light
wind
,
whose
rustling
be
as
gentle
to

as
softly

fall

have
its
hope

a

in

it
go
flutter
by
,
whisper
of
its
intercourse
with
Summer
,

of
his
happy
coming

<EOS>
the
solitary
rider
go
glance
on
among
the
tree
,
from
sunlight
into
shade
and
back
again
,
at
the
same
even
pace
---
look
about
him
,
certainly
,
from
time
to
time
,
but
with
no
great
thought
of
the
day
or
the
scene
through
which
he
move
,
than
that
he
be
fortunate
(
be
choicely
dress
)
to
have
such
favourable
weather
.
<EOS>
He
smile
very
complacently
at
such
time
,
but
rather
as
if
he
be
satisfied
with
himself
than
with
anything
else
:
and
so
go
ride
on
,
upon
his
chestnut
cob
,
as
pleasant
to
look
upon
as
his
own
horse
,
and
probably
far
less
sensitive
to
the
many
cheerful
influence
by
which
he
be
surround
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
time
,
the
Maypole

massive
chimney
rise
upon
his
view
:
but
he
quicken
not
his
pace
one
jot
,
and
with
the
same
cool
gravity
ride
up
to
the
tavern
porch

with
surpass
foresight

quickness

have
be

he
look
at

that
if
that

it

ultimately
become
necessary

off

issue
forth

lustily
for

up

add
Mr
Willet
,
after
an
enormously
long
pause
,
during
which
he
fix
his
great
dull
eye
on
Hugh
,
and
wait
with
exemplary
patience
for
any
little
property
in
the
way
of
idea
that
may
come
to
him

"
we

pretty

Hugh
shrug
his
shoulder
scornfully

in
his
reckless
swaggering
way
,
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
little
green
,
and
there
,
with
the
bridle
slung
loosely
over
his
shoulder
,
lead
the
horse
to
and
fro
,
glance
at
his
master
every
now

then
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrow

with
as
sinister
an
aspect

<EOS>
Mr

,
who
,
without
appear
to
do
so
,
have
eye
him
attentively
during
this
brief
dispute
,
step
into
the
porch
,
and
turn
abruptly
to
Mr
Willet
,
say
,
  
"
You
keep
strange
servant

John

"
  
<EOS>
"
strange

the

but
out
of
door
;
for
horse

dog

the
like
of

there

Maypole
Hugh
yonder

He
an't
fit

add
Mr

,
with
the
confidential
air
of
a
man
who
feel
his
own
superior
nature

<EOS>
"
I
do
that

imagination

"
He
be
an
active
fellow
now
<EOS>
,
I
dare
swear
,
"
say
Mr
Chester
,
in
a
musing
tone
,
which
seem
to
suggest
that
he
would
have
say
the
same
have
there
be
nobody
to
hear
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
active
,
sir

retort
John
,
with
quite
an
expression
in
his
face
;
"
that
chap
!
 
<EOS>
hallo
there
!
 
<EOS>
You
,
sir

<EOS>
bring
that
horse
here

and
hang
my
wig
on

to
show
this

whether
you
be
one
of

lively
sort

not

"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
make
no
answer
,
but
throw
the
bridle
to
his
master
,
and
snatch
his
wig
from
his
head
,
in
a
manner
so
unceremonious
and
hasty
that
the
action
discompose
Mr
Willet
not
a
little
,
though
perform
at
his
own
special
desire
,
climb
nimbly
to
the
very
summit
of
the
maypole
before
the
house
,
and
hang
the
wig
upon
the
weathercock
,
send
it
twirl
round
like
a
roast
jack
.
<EOS>
have
achieve
this
performance
,
he
cast
it
on
the
ground
,
and
slide
down
the
pole
with
inconceivable
rapidity
,
alight
on
his
foot
almost
as
soon
as
it
have
touch
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
sir
,
"
say
John
,
relapse
into
his
usual
stolid
state
,
"
you
will
not
see
that
at
many
house
,
besides
the
Maypole

where
there
be
good
accommodation
for
man
and
beast
---
nor
that
neither
,
though
that
with
him
be
nothing

"
  
<EOS>
this
last
remark
bore
reference
to
his
vaulting
on
horseback
,
as
upon
Mr
Chester
's
first
visit
,
and
quickly
disappear
by
the
stable
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
with
him
be
nothing
,
"
repeat
Mr
Willet
,
brush
his
wig
with
his
wrist
,
and
inwardly
resolve
to
distribute
a
small
charge
for
dust
and
damage
to
that
article
of
dress
,
through
the
various
item
of
his
guest
's
bill
;

he
will
get
out
of

any
winder
in
the
house

<EOS>
there
never
be
such
a
chap
for
fling
himself
about
and
never
hurt
his
bone
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
opinion
,
sir
,
that
it
be
pretty
nearly
allow
to
his
not
have
any
imagination
;
and
that
if
imagination
could
be
(
which
it
can
not
)
knock
into
him
,
he
would
never
be
able
to
do
it
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
be
a
-
talking
,
sir
,
about
my
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
,
Willet
,
true
,
"
say
his
visitor
,
turn
again
towards
the
landlord
with
his
accustomed
serenity
of
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
friend
,
what
about
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
report
that
Mr
Willet
,
previously
to
make
answer
,
wink
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
be
never
know
to
be
guilty
of
such
lightness
of
conduct
either
before
or
afterwards
,
this
may
be
look
upon
as
a
malicious
invention
of
his
enemy
---
found
,
perhaps
,
upon
the
undisputed
circumstance
of
his
take
his
guest
by
the
third
breast
button
of
his
coat
,
count
downward
from
the
chin
,
and
pour
his
reply
into
his
ear
:
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
whisper
John
,
with
dignity
,
"
I
know
my
duty

<EOS>
We
want
no
love

make
here
,
sir

unbeknown
to
parent

<EOS>
I
respect
a
certain
young
gentleman
,
take
him
in
the
light
of
a
young
gentleman

I
respect
a
certain
young
lady

take
her
in
the
light
of
a
young

but
of
the
two
as

I

none
whatever

<EOS>
My
son

be
upon
his
patrole

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
see
him
look
through
the
corner
window
<EOS>
but
this
moment
,
"
say
Mr
Chester
,
who
naturally
think
that
be
on
patrole

imply
walk
about
somewhere

<EOS>
"
no

you

return
John

<EOS>
"
He
be
upon
his
patrole

honour

not

leave
the
premise

<EOS>
Me
and
some
friend
of
mine
that
use
the
Maypole
of
an
evening
,
sir

consider
what
be
good
to
be
do
with
him
,
to
prevent
his
do
anything
unpleasant
in
oppose
your
desire
;

we
have
put
him
on
his
patrole

<EOS>
and
what
be
more
,
sir
,
he
will
not
be
off
his
patrole
for
a
pretty
long
time
to
come
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
communicate
this
bright
idea
,
which
have
its
origin
in
the
perusal
by
the
village
crony
of
a
newspaper
,
contain
,
among
other
matter
,
an
account
of
how
some
officer
pende
the
sentence
of
some
court
-
martial
have
be
enlarge
on
parole
,
Mr
Willet
draw
back
from
his
guest
's
ear
,
and
without
any
visible
alteration
of
feature
,
chuckled
thrice
audibly
.
 
<EOS>
this
near
approach
to
a
laugh
in
which
he
ever
indulge
(
and
that
<EOS>
but
seldom
and
only
on
extreme
occasion
)
,
never
even
curl
his
lip
or
effect
the
small
change
in
---
no
,
not
so
much
as
a
slight
wagging
of
---
his
great
,
fat
,
double
chin
,
which
at
these
time
,
as
at
all
other
,
remain
a
perfect
desert
in
the
broad
map
of
his
face
;
one
changeless
,
dull
,
tremendous
blank
.
  
<EOS>
lest
it
should
be
matter
of
surprise
to
any
,
that
Mr
Willet
adopt
this
bold
course
in
opposition
to
one
whom
he
have
often
entertain
,
and
who
have
always
pay
his
way
at
the
Maypole
gallantly
,
it
may
be
remark
that
it
be
his
very
penetration
and
sagacity
in
this
respect
,
which
occasion
him
to
indulge
in
those
unusual
demonstration
of
jocularity
,
just
now
record
.
 
<EOS>
for
Mr
Willet
,
after
carefully
balance
father
and
son
in
his
mental
scale
,
have
arrive
at
the
distinct
conclusion
that
the
old
gentleman
be
a
well
sort
of
a
customer
than
the
young
one
.
<EOS>
throw
his
landlord
into
the
same
scale
,
which
be
already
turn
by
this
consideration
,
and
heap
upon
him
,
again
,
his
strong
desire
to
run
counter
to
the
unfortunate
Joe
,
and
his
opposition
as
a
general
principle
to
all
matter
of
love
and
matrimony
,
it
go
down
to
the
very
ground
straightway
,

send
the
light
cause
of

young

fly
upwards
to
the
ceiling

<EOS>
Mr

be
not
the
kind
of
man
to
be
by
any
mean
dim

sighted
to
Mr
Willet
's
motive
,

he
thank
him
as
graciously
as
if
he
have
be
one
of
the

Chapter

a
homely
proverb
recognise
the
existence
of
a
troublesome
class
of
person
who

have
an

concede
them
,
will
take
an

not

the

,
whose
amiable
path
in

have
be
from
birth
to
death
through
blood

who

to
teach
mankind
that
as

,
may

a
blessed
place

not
to
quote
such
mighty
instance
,
it
will
be
sufficient
to
refer
to
old
John
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
Old
John
have
long
encroach
a
good
standard
inch
,
full

on

liberty

snip

despotic

Yards

furlong

and
on
go
old
John
in
the
pleasantest
manner
possible
,
trim
off
an
exuberance
in
this
place
,
shear
away
some
liberty
of
speech
or
action
in
that
,
and
conduct
himself
in
his
small
way
with
as
much
high
mightiness
and
majesty
,
as
the
most
glorious
tyrant
that
ever
have
his
statue
rear
in
the
public
way

of
ancient

of
modern

abuse

power
(
when
they
need
urge

which
be
not

,
by
their
flatterer

dependent
,
so
old
John
be
impel
to
these
exercise
of
authority
by
the
applause
and
admiration
of
his
Maypole
crony
,
who
,
in
the
interval
of
their
nightly
pipe
and
pot
,
would
shake
their
head
and
say
that
Mr
Willet
be
a
father
of
the
good
old
english
sort
;
that
there
be
no
new
-
fangle
notion
or
modern
way
in
him
;
that
he
put
them
in
mind
of
what
their
father
be
when
they
be
boy
;
that
there
be
no
mistake
about
him
;
that
it
would
be
well
for
the
country
if
there
be
more
like
him
,
and
more
be
the
pity
that
there
be
not
;
with
many
other
original
remark
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
then
they
would
condescendingly
give
Joe
to
understand
that
it
be
all
for
his
good
,
and
he
would
be
thankful
for
it
one
day
;
and
in
particular
,
Mr
Cobb
would
acquaint
him
,
that
when
he
be
his
age
,
his
father
think
no
more
of
give
him
a
parental
kick

a
box
on
the
ear
,
or
a
cuff
on
the
head
,
or
some
little
admonition
of
that
sort
,
than
he
do
of
any
other
ordinary
duty
of
life
;
and
he
would
further
remark
,
with
look
of
great
significance
,
that
but
for
this
judicious
bringing
up
,
he
may
have
never
be
the
man
he
be
at
that
present
speak
;
which
be
probable
enough
,
as
he
be
,
beyond
all
question
,
the
dull
dog
of
the
party

<EOS>
in
short
,
between
old
John

John

there
never
be
an
unfortunate
young

so
bully

this

very
anxious

his

before

Mr

he
do
that

exceed

do
so
goad

chafe
his

have
make
a
solemn
vow

nothing

Mr

take
upon

knock

find

that
day

he
be
not

poetically
speak

smite
the

so
that

ring
again

resume
his
old

peacefully
preserve

house
shut
up
at
night
,
but
that
Mr
Cobb
,
stimulate
by
the
wonder
of
the
company
at
the
young
man
's
presumption
,
retort
with
sundry
taunt
,
which
prove
too
much
for
flesh
and
blood
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
crowd
into
one
moment
the
vexation
and
the
wrath
of
year
,
Joe
start
up
,
overturn
the
table
,
<EOS>
fall
upon
his
long
enemy
,
pummel
him
with
all
his
might
and
main
,
and
finish
by
drive
him
with
surprising
swiftness
against
a
heap
of
spittoon
in
one
corner
;
plunge
into
which
,
head
foremost
,
with
a
tremendous
crash
,
he
lie
at
full
length
among
the
ruin
,
stunned
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
without
wait
to
receive
the
compliment
of
the
bystander
on
the
victory
be
have
win
,
he
retreat
to
his
own
bedchamber
,
and
consider
himself
in
a
state
of
siege
,
pile
all
the
portable
furniture
against
the
door
by
way
of
barricade
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
it
now
,
"
say
Joe
,
as
he
sit
down
upon
his
bedstead
and
wipe
his
heated
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
would
come
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
the
Maypole
and
I
must
part
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
rove
vagabond

me
for

it

all
over

Chapter
31
    
ponder
on
his
unhappy
lot
,
Joe
sit
and
listen
for
a
long
time
,
expect
every
moment
to
hear
their
creak
footstep
on
the
stair
,
or
to
be
greet
by
his
worthy
father
with
a
summon
to
capitulate
unconditionally
,
and
deliver
himself
up
straightway
.
<EOS>
but
neither
voice
nor
footstep
come
;
and
though
some
distant
echo
,
as
of
closing
door
and
people
hurry
in
and
out
of
room
,
resound
from
time
to
time
through
the
great
passage
,
and
penetrate
to
his
remote
seclusion
,
give
note
of
unusual
commotion
downstairs
,
no
nearer
sound
disturb
his
place
of
retreat
,
which
seem
the
quieter
for
these
far
-
off
noise
,
and
be
as
dull
and
full
of
gloom
as
any
hermit
's
cell
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
on
darker
and
dark
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
-
fashioned
furniture
of
the
chamber
,
which
be
a
kind
of
hospital
for
all
the
invalided
movable
in
the
house
,
grow
indistinct
and
shadowy
in
its
many
shape
;
chair
and
table
,
which
by
day
be
as
honest
cripple
as
need
be
,
assume
a
doubtful
and
mysterious
character
;
and
one
old
leprous
screen
of
fade
India
leather
and
gold
binding
,
which
have
keep
out
many
a
cold
breath
of
air
in
day
of
yore
and
shut
in
many
a
jolly
face
,
frown
on
him
with
a
spectral
aspect
,
and
stand
at
full
height
in
its
allot
corner
,
like
some
gaunt
ghost
who
wait
to
be
question
.
 
<EOS>
a
portrait
opposite
the
window
---
a
queer
,
old
grey
-
eyed
general
,
in
an
oval
frame
---
seem
to
wink
and
doze
as
the
light
decay
,
and
at
length
,
when
the
last
faint
glimmering
speck
of
day
go
out
,
to
shut
its
eye
in
good
earnest
,
and
fall
sound
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
hush
and
mystery
about
everything
,
that
Joe
could
not
help
follow
its
example
;
and
so
go
off
into
a
slumber
likewise
,
and
dream
of
Dolly
,
till
the
clock
of
Chigwell
church
strike
two
.
  
<EOS>
still
nobody
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
distant
noise
in
the
house
have
cease
,
and
out
of
door
<EOS>
all
be
quiet
;
save
for
the
occasional
barking
of
some
deep
-
mouthed
dog
,
and
the
shaking
of
the
branch
by
the
night
wind
.
 
<EOS>
He
gaze
mournfully
out
of
window
at
each
well
-
know
object
as
it
lie
sleep
in
the
dim
light
of
the
moon
;
and
creep
back
to
his
former
seat
,
think
about
the
late
uproar
,
until
,
with
long
thinking
of
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
have
occur
a
month
ago
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
between
dozing
,
and
think
,
and
walk
to
the
window
and
look
out
,
the
night
wear
away
;
the
grim
old
screen
,
and
the
kindre
chair
and
table
,
begin
slowly
to
reveal
themselves
in
their
accustomed
form
;
the
grey
-
eyed
general
seem
to
wink
and
yawn
and
rouse
himself
;
and
at
last
he
be
broad
awake
again
,
and
very
uncomfortable
and
cold
and
haggard
he
look
,
in
the
dull
grey
light
of
morning
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
have
begin
to
peep
above
the
forest
tree
,
and
already
fling
across
the
curl
mist
bright
bar
of
gold
,
when
Joe
drop
from
his
window
on
the
ground
below
,
a
little
bundle
and
his
trusty
stick
,
and
prepare
to
descend
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
very
difficult
task
;
for
there
be
so
many
projection
and
gable
end
in
the
way
,
that
they
form
a
series
of
clumsy
step
,
with
no
great
obstacle
than
a
jump
of
some
few
foot
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
,
with
his
stick
and
bundle
on
his
shoulder
,
quickly
stand
on
the
firm
earth
,
and
look
up
at
the
old
Maypole
,
it
may
be
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
apostrophise
it
,
for
he
be
no
great
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
curse
it
,
for
he
have
little
ill
-
will
to
give
to
anything
on
earth
.
<EOS>
He
feel
more
affectionate
and
kind
to
it
than
ever
he
have
do
in
all
his
life
before
,
so
say
with
all
his
heart
,
"
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
as
a
parting
wish
,
and
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
walk
along
at
a
brisk
pace
,
big
with
great
thought
of
go
for
a
soldier
and
die
in
some
foreign
country
where
it
be
very
hot
and
sandy
,
and
leave
God
know
what
unheard
-
of
wealth
in
prize
-
money
to
Dolly
,
who
would
be
very
much
affected
when
she
come
to
know
of
it
;
and
full
of
such
youthful
vision
,
which
be
sometimes
sanguine
and
sometimes
melancholy
,
but
always
have
her
for
their
main
point
and
centre
,
push
on
vigorously
until
the
noise
of
London
sound
in
his
ear
,
and
the
Black
Lion
hove
in
sight
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
only
eight
o'clock
then
,
and
very
much
astonish
the
Black
Lion
be
,
to
see
him
come
walk
in
with
dust
upon
his
foot
at
that
early
hour
,
with
no
grey
mare
to
bear
him
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
order
breakfast
to
be
get
ready
with
all
speed
,
and
on
its
be
set
before
him
give
indisputable
token
of
a
hearty
appetite
,
the
Lion
receive
him
,
as
usual
,
with
a
hospitable
welcome
;
and
treat
him
with
those
mark
of
distinction
,
which
,
as
a
regular
customer
,
and
one
within
the
freemasonry
of
the
trade
,
he
have
a
right
to
claim
.
  
<EOS>
this
lion
or
landlord
,
---
for
he
be
call
both
man
and
beast
,
by
reason
of
his
have
instruct
the
artist
who
paint
his
sign
,
to
convey
into
the
feature
of
the
lordly
brute
whose
effigy
it
bear
,
as
near
a
counterpart
of
his
own
face
as
his
skill
could
compass
and
devise
,
---
be
a
gentleman
almost
as
quick
of
apprehension
,
and
of
almost
as
subtle
a
wit
,
as
the
mighty
John
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
difference
between
them
lie
in
this
:
that
whereas
Mr
Willet
's
extreme
sagacity
and
acuteness
be
the
effort
of
unassisted
nature
<EOS>
,
the
Lion
stand
indebted
,
in
no
small
amount
,
to
beer
;
of
which
he
swig
such
copious
draught
,
that
most
of
his
faculty
be
utterly
drown
and
wash
away
,
except
the
one
great
faculty
of
sleep
,
which
he
retain
in
surprising
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
the
creak
Lion
over
the
house
-
door
be
,
therefore
,
to
say
the
truth
,
rather
a
drowsy
,
tame
,
and
feeble
lion
;
and
as
these
social
representative
of
a
savage
class
be
usually
of
a
conventional
character
(
be
depict
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
impossible
attitude
and
of
unearthly
colour
)
,
he
be
frequently
suppose
by
the
more
ignorant
and
uninformed
among
the
neighbour
,
to
be
the
veritable
portrait
of
the
host
as
he
appear
on
the
occasion
of
some
great
funeral
ceremony
or
public
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
noisy
fellow
be
that
in
the
next
room
?
"
say
Joe
,
when
he
have
dispose
of
his
breakfast
,
and
have
wash
and
brush
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
recruiting
serjeant
,
"
reply
the
Lion
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
start
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
very
thing
he
have
be
dream
of
,
all
the
way
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
wish
,
"
say
the
Lion
,
"
he
be
anywhere
else
but
here
.
 
<EOS>
the
party
make
noise
enough
,
but
do
not
call
for
much
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
great
cry
there
,
Mr
Willet
,
but
very
little
wool
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
would
not
like
'em
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
not
much
under
any
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
if
he
could
have
know
what
be
pass
at
that
moment
in
Joe
's
mind
,
he
would
have
like
them
still
less
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
recruit
for
a
---
for
a
fine
regiment
?
"
say
Joe
,
glance
at
a
little
round
mirror
that
hang
in
the
bar
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
be
,
"
reply
the
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
much
the
same
thing
,
whatever
regiment
he
be
recruit
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
there
an't
<EOS>
a
deal
of
difference
between
a
fine
man
and
another
one
,
when
they
be
shoot
through
and
through
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
not
all
shoot
,
"
say
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
the
Lion
answer
,
"
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
those
that
be
---
suppose
it
be
do
easy
---
be
the
good
off
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
ah
!
"
retort
Joe
,
"
but
you
do
not
care
for
glory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
what
?
"
say
the
Lion
.
  
<EOS>
"
glory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
return
the
Lion
,
with
supreme
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
You
be
right
in
that
,
Mr
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
when
Glory
come
here
,
and
call
for
anything
to
drink
and
change
a
guinea
to
pay
for
it
,
I
will
give
it
him
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
belief
,
sir
,
that
the
Glory
's
arm
would
not
do
a
very
strong
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
these
remark
be
not
at
all
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
walk
out
,
stop
at
the
door
of
the
next
room
,
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
the
serjeant
be
describe
a
military
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
drink
,
he
say
,
except
that
there
be
frequent
interval
of
eat
and
love

making
.
 
<EOS>
a
battle
be
the
fine
thing
in
the
world

when
your
side
win
it

and
Englishmen
always
do
that

<EOS>
"
suppose
you

say
a
timid
voice
in
one
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
well

the

no

Joe
walk
into

back

He

that

honest

perhaps
too
proud
to
score
up
to
his

he
have
but
a
penny

<EOS>
He

who
waylay

at

for
it
should
go
hard
,
he
have
resolve
,
but
he
would
have
a

word
with
charming
Dolly
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
out
by
Islington
and
so
on
to
Highgate
,
and
sit
on
many
stone
and
gate
,
but
there
be
no

since
the

the

they
ring
out
no

they
be
use

have
grow
worldly

<EOS>
Joe
buy
a
roll
,
and
reduce
his
purse
to
the
condition
(
with
a
difference

of

of
Fortunatus

which

evening
draw

<EOS>
with
the
desolate

solitary
feeling
of
one

have
no

shelter
,
and
be
alone
utterly
in
the
world
for
the
first
time
,
he
bend
his

towards
the

<EOS>
He
have
delay
till
now
,
know
that
Mrs

sometimes
go
out
alone
,
or
with
Miggs
for
her
sole
attendant
,
to
lecture
in
the
evening
;
and
devoutly
hope
that
this
may
be
one
of
her
night
of
moral
culture
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
walk
up
and
down
before
the
house
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
two
or
three
time
,
when
as
he
return
to
it
again
,
he
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
flutter
skirt
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Dolly

to
whom
else
could
it
belong
?
<EOS>

such
a

as
that

<EOS>
He
pluck
up
his
spirit
,
and
follow
it
into
the
workshop
of
the
Golden
Key
.
  
<EOS>
His
darkening
the
door
cause
her
to
look
round
.
 
<EOS>
oh
that
face
!
<EOS>
"
if
it

She

"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
say
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
think
it
---
perhaps
look
it
also
.
<EOS>
Dolly
be
glad
to
see
him
,
and
be
so
sorry
her
father
and
mother
be
away
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
beg
she
would
not
mention
it
on
any
account
.
  
<EOS>
dolly
hesitate
to
lead
the
way
into
the
parlour
,
for
there
it
be
nearly
dark
;
at
the
same
time
she
hesitate
to
stand
talk
in
the
workshop
,
which
be
yet
light
and
open
to
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
get
by
some
mean
,
too
,
before
the
little
forge
;
and
Joe
have
her
hand
in
his
(
which
he
have
no
right
to
have
,
<EOS>
for
Dolly
only
give
it
him
to
shake
)
,
it
be
so
like

before
some
homely
altar

,
that
it
be
the
most
embarrassing
state
of
thing
in
the

perhaps
for

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
this
be
exactly
what
he
should
not
have
say
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
be
,
talk
like
a
gentleman
at
large
who
be
free
to
come
and
go
and
roam
about
the
world
at
pleasure
,
when
that
gallant
coachmaker
have
vow
but
<EOS>
the
night
before
that
Miss

chain
;
and
have
positively
state
in
so
many
word
that
she
be
kill
him
by
inch
,
and
that
in
a
fortnight
more
or
thereabout
he
expect
to
make
a
decent
end
and
leave
the
business
to
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
dolly
release
her
hand
and
say

<EOS>
She
remark
in
the

breath
that
it
be
a
fine
night
,
and
in
short
,
betray
no
more
emotion
than
the
forge
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
go
,
"
say
Joe
,
"
without
come
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
heart
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
be
more
sorry
than
she
could
tell
,
that
he
should
have
take
so
much
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
long
way
,
and
he
must
have
such
a
deal
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
be
Mr
Willet
---
that
dear
old
gentleman

<EOS>

<EOS>
Good

<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
take
her
apron
in
her
hand
and
run
her
eye
along
the
hem
from
corner
to
corner
,
to
keep
herself
from
laugh
in
his
face
;
---
not
because
his
gaze
confuse
her
---
not
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
have
small
experience
in
love
affair
,
and
have
no
notion
how
different
young
lady
be
at
different
time
;
he
have
expect
to
take
dolly
up
again
at
the
very
point
where
he
have
leave
her
after
that
delicious
evening
ride
,
and
be
no
more
prepared
for
such
an
alteration
than
to
see
the
sun
and
moon
change
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
buoy
himself
up
all
day
with
an
indistinct
idea
that
she
would
certainly
say
"
do
not
go
,
"
or
"
do
not
leave
us
,
"
or
"
why
do
you
go
?
"
or
"
why
do
you
leave
us
?
"
or
would
give
him
some
little
encouragement
of
that
sort
;
he
have
even
entertain
the
possibility
of
her
burst
into
tear
,
of
her
throw
herself
into
his
arm
,
of
her
fall
down
in
a
fainting
fit
without
previous
word
or
sign
;
but
any
approach
to
such
a
line
of
conduct
as
this
,
have
be
so
far
from
his
thought
that
he
could
only
look
at
her
in
silent
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
dolly
in
the
meanwhile
,
turn
to
the
corner
of
her

the
wrinkle

silent

Misfortunes

saith

<EOS>
there
be
little
doubt
that
trouble
be
exceedingly
gregarious
in
their
nature
,
and
fly
in
flock
,
be
apt
to
perch
capriciously
;
crowd
on
the

of
some
poor

there
be
not
an

of

It

brood

for
Joseph

whom
they
could
not
find
,
dart
down
haphazard
on
the
first
young

that
catch

settle
on
him
instead

<EOS>
however
this
may
be
,
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
on
the
very
day
of
Joe
's
departure
they
swarm
about
the
ear
of
Edward
Chester
,
and
do
so
buzz
and
flap
their
wing
,
and
persecute
him
,
that
he
be
most
profoundly
wretched
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
evening
,
and
just
eight
o'clock

when
he

his

They
have
dine
together

a

be
present
during
the
meal
,

until
they
meet
at
table
they
have
not

other

the
previous

<EOS>
Edward
be

Mr

"

It

<EOS>
Edward

the

without

his
back

for
ever

slightly
flush

heated

one
wintry
evening

dark

night
come
on
with
black
and
dismal
look

a
bitter
storm
of
sleet
,
sharp
,
dense
,
and
icy
-
cold
,
sweep
the
wet
street
,
and
rattle
on
the

Signboards

shake
past

in

,
fall
crash
on
the
pavement
;
old
tottering
chimney
reel
and
stagger
in
the
blast
;
and
many
a
steeple
rock
again
that
night
,
as
though
the
earth
be
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
time
for
those
who
could
by
any
mean
get
light
and
warmth
,
to
brave
the
fury
of
the
weather

in
coffee

house

round
the

uncouth
figure
round
the
hearth

who
talk
of
vessel

at
sea

and
all

lose
;
relate
many
a
dismal
tale
of
shipwreck
and
drown
man
,
and
hope
that
some
they

safe

and
shake
their
head
in
doubt

<EOS>
in
private

with
timid
pleasure
to
tale

ghost

goblin

and
tall

white
standing
by

people

have
go
to
sleep
in
old
church

be

find
themselves
alone
there
at
the
dead
hour
of
the
night

until
they
shudder
at
the
thought
of
the
dark
room
upstairs
,
yet
love
to
hear
the
wind
moan
too
,
and

it
would
continue
bravely

<EOS>
from
time

time
these
happy
indoor
people
stop
to
listen
,
or
one
hold
up

cry
"
hark

<EOS>
and
then

above

rumbling
in

a
wailing

rush
sound

which
shake
the

as
though
a
giant

hand
be
on
them

then
a
hoarse
roar
as
if
the
sea

rise
;
then
such
a
whirl

tumult
that
the
air
seem
mad
;
and
then
,
with
a
lengthen
howl

the
wave
of
wind
sweep
on
,

leave
a
moment

interval
of
rest

cheerily

how

great

sit
there
since

strike
eight

give
no
other
sign
of

than
breathe
with
a
loud
and
constant
snore
(

he
be
wide
awake

from
time
to
time
put
his
glass
to
his

knock
the
ashe
out

Mr

for
two
mortal
hour

a
half

none
of
the
company
have
pronounce
one
word

<EOS>
whether
people

by
dint

together
in
the

place

the

and
do
exactly
the

acquire
a
sixth

or
some
unknown
power
of
influence
each
other

a
question
for

<EOS>
but
certain
it
be
that
old
John
Willet
,
Mr
Parkes
,
and
Mr
Cobb
,
be
one
and
all
firmly
of
opinion
that
they
be
very
jolly
companion

rather
choice
spirit
than
otherwise
;
that
they
look
at
each
other
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
as
if
there
be
a
perpetual
interchange
of
idea
go
on
among
them
;
that
no
man
consider
himself
or
his
neighbour
by
any
mean
silent
;
and
that
each
of
them
nod
occasionally
when
he
catch
the
eye
of
another

if
he
would
say
,
"
You
have
express
yourself
extremely
well

I
quite
agree

<EOS>
the

be
so
very
warm

tobacco
so
very
good

and
the
fire
so
very
soothing
,
that
Mr
Willet
by
degree
begin
to
doze
;
but
as
he
have
perfectly
acquire
,
by
dint
of
long
habit
,
the
art
of
smoking
in
his
sleep
,
and
as
his
breathing
be
pretty
much
the
same
,
awake
or
asleep
,
save
that
in
the
latter
case
he
sometimes
experience
a
slight
difficulty
in
respiration
(
such
as
a
carpenter
meet
with
when
he
be
plane
and
come
to
a
knot
)
,
neither
of
his
companion
be
aware

one
of
these
impediment

be
oblige

try
again

"

Mr

come
to
another
knot

one
of
surpass
obduracy

which
bade
fair
to
throw
him
into
convulsion
,
but
which
he
get
over
at
last
without

by
an
effort
quite
superhuman

"
He
sleep
uncommon
hard

Mr

Mr

a
hard

sleeper
himself

reply
with
some
disdain
,
"
not

and
direct
his
eye
towards
a

paste
over
the
chimney

piece

which
be
decorate
at
the
top
with
a
woodcut

very
fast

with

end
of
a

to
carry
out

a

post
and
a

beside
him

<EOS>
Mr

likewise
turn
his
eye
in
the
same
direction

and
survey
the
placard
as
if
that
be
the
first
time
he
have
ever
beheld
it

<EOS>
now
,
this
be
a

Mr

have
himself
indite

who
would
pack
him
up

until
such

<EOS>
in
this
advertisement
Mr
Willet
have
obstinately
persist
,
despite
the
advice
and
entreaty
of
his
friend
,
in
describe
his
son
as
a
"
young
boy
;
"
and
furthermore
as
be
from
eighteen
inch
to
a
couple
of
foot
short
than
he
really

two
circumstance
which
perhaps
account
,
in
some
degree
,
for
its
never
have
be
productive
of
any
other
effect
than
the

some
five

forty
runaway

<EOS>
Mr
Cobb
and
Mr
Parkes
look
mysteriously
at
this
composition
,
at
each
other
,
and
at
old
John
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
time
he
have
paste
it
up
with
his
own
hand
,
Mr
Willet
have
never
by
word
or
sign
allude
to
the
subject
,
or
encourage
any
one
else
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
have
the
least
notion
what
his
thought
or
opinion
be

connect
with
it
;
whether
he
remember
it
or
forget
it
;
whether
he
have
any
idea
that
such
an
event
have
ever
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
even
while
he
sleep
,
no
one
venture
to
refer
to
it
in
his
presence
;
and
for
such
sufficient
reason
,
these
his
choose
friend
be
silent
now
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
have
get
by
this
time
into
such
a
complication
of
knot
,
that
it
be
perfectly
clear
he
must
wake
or
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
choose
the
former
alternative
,
and
open
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
do
not
come
in
five
minute

"
say
John
,
"
I
shall
have
supper

"
  
<EOS>
the
antecedent
of
this
pronoun
have
be
mention
for
the
last
time
at
eight
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Messrs
Parkes
and
Cobb
be
use
to
this
style
of
conversation
,
reply
without
difficulty
that
to
be
sure
Solomon
be
very
late
,
and
they
wonder
what
have
happen
to
detain
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
an't
blow
away
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
Parkes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
enough
to
carry
a
man
of
his
figure
off
his
leg
,
and
easy
too
.
 
<EOS>
do
you

"
do

"

no

"
  
"
very
good

Mr

perfectly
unmoved
;

just
now

you
will
wait
a
little
time

you

hear
it

both

very
plain

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
after
listen
for
a
few
moment
,
they
could
clearly
hear
,
above
the
roar
and
tumult
out
of
door
,
this
shout
repeat
;
and
that
with
a
shrillness
and
energy
,
which
denote
that
it
come
from
some
person
in
great
distress
or
terror
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
at
each
other
,
turn
pale
,
and
hold
their
breath
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
stir
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
emergency
that
Mr
Willet
display
something
of
that
strength
of
mind
and
plenitude
of
mental
resource
,
which
render
him
the
admiration
of
all
his
friend
and
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
after
look
at
Messrs
Parkes
and
Cobb
for
some
time
in
silence
,
he
clap
his
two
hand
to
his
cheek
,
and
send
forth
a
roar
which
make
the
glass
dance
and
rafter
ring
---
a
long
-
sustained
,
discordant
bellow
,
that
roll
onward
with
the
wind
,
and
startle
every
echo
,
make
the
night
a
hundred
time
more
boisterous
---
a
deep
,
loud
,
dismal
bray
,
that
sound
like
a
human
gong

<EOS>
then
,
with
every
vein
in
his
head
and
face
swollen
with
the
great
exertion
,
and
his
countenance
suffuse
with
a
lively
purple
,
he
draw
a
little
nearer
to
the
fire
,
and
turn
his
back
upon
it
,
say
with
dignity
:

that
be
any
comfort

be
difficult

,
reflect
his
dismayed

horror

stricken
visage

stare
back
again
without

in

fit

temporary
insanity

make
a
dive
at

cravat

,
seize

Mr

in

his
word
to
the
very
letter

(
Solomon

the

not

reassure
his

to

him
a

manner

he
be

quite
easy
in
his
theory

"
that
a
ghost
as
have
be
a
man
of
sense
in
his
lifetime

would
be
out

such
weather
<EOS>

I
only
know
that
I

not

I

"
  
<EOS>
but
this
heretical
doctrine
be
strongly
oppose
by
the
other
three
,
who
quote
a
great
many
precedent
to
show
that
bad
weather
be
the
very
time
for
such
appearance
;
and
Mr
Parkes
(
who
have
have
a
ghost
in
his
family
,
by
the
mother
's
side
)
argue
the
matter
with
so
much
ingenuity
and
force
of
illustration
,
that
John
be
only
save
from
have
to
retract
his
opinion
by
the
opportune
appearance
of
supper
,
to
which
they
apply
themselves
with
a
dreadful
relish

Solomon

on

occasion
,
propound
all
manner
of
lead
question
calculate
to
surround
the
story
with
new
horror
and
surprise

<EOS>
but
Solomon
Daisy
,
notwithstanding
these
temptation
,
adhere
so
steadily
to
his
original
account
,
and
repeat
it
so
often
,
with
such
slight
variation
,
and
with
such
solemn
asseveration
of
its
truth
and
reality
,
that
his
hearer
be
(
with
good
reason
)
more
astonished
than
at
first

<EOS>
as
he
take
John
Willet
's
view
of
the
matter
in
regard
to
the
propriety
of
not
bruit
the
tale
abroad
,
unless
the
spirit
should
appear
to
him
again
,
in
which
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
immediate
counsel
with
the
clergyman

it
be
solemnly
resolve
that
it
should
be
hush
up
and
keep
quiet

<EOS>
and
as
most
man
like
to
have
a
secret
to
tell
which
may
exalt
their
own
importance
,
they
arrive
at
this
conclusion
with
perfect
unanimity
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
by
this
time
grow
late
,
and
be
long
past
their
usual
hour
of
separating

the
crony

Solomon

with
a
fresh
candle
in

lantern

repair
homeward
under
the
escort
of
long
Phil
Parkes

Mr
Cobb

rather
more
nervous
than
himself

<EOS>
Mr
Willet
,
after
see
them
to
the
door
,
return
to
collect
his
thought
with
the
assistance
of
the
boiler
,
and
to
listen
to
the
storm
of
wind

rain

Chapter

quite
twenty
minute

get
his
idea
into
a
focus
,
and
bring
them
to
bear
upon
Solomon
Daisy
's
story

<EOS>
the
more
he
think
of
it
,
the
more
impressed
he
become
with
a
sense
of
his
own
wisdom
,
and
a
desire
that
Mr
Haredale
should
be
impressed
with
it
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
to
the
end
that
he
may
sustain
a
principal

important
character
in
the
affair

may
have
the
start
of
Solomon
and
his
two
friend

through
whose
mean
he
know
the
adventure
,
with
a
variety
of
exaggeration

would

a

most
likely
to
Mr

himself
,
by

"
He

John

set
it
down
in

corner
out

wrap

Hugh

with
much
low
growling

go
back
into
his

and
presently
reappear
,
carry
a
lantern
and
a
cudgel

and
envelop
from
head

in
an
old

frowzy

slouch

<EOS>
Mr

receive
this
figure
at

usher
him
into

while
he
wrap
himself
in

greatcoat

so
tied
and
knot
his
face
in
shawl

handkerchief

that
how

<EOS>
"
You

Hugh
obey
with
a
very
indifferent
grace
,
and
a
longing
glance
at
the
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
Old
John
,
lay
strict
injunction
on
his
cook
to
keep
the
door
lock
in
his
absence
,
and
to
open
to
nobody
but
himself
on
pain
of
dismissal
,
follow
him
into
the
blustering
darkness
out
of
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
way
be
wet
and
dismal
,
and
the
night
so
black
,
that
if
Mr
Willet
have
be
his
own
pilot
,
he
would
have
walk
into
a
deep
horsepond
within
a
few
hundred
yard
of
his
own
house
,
and
would
certainly
have
terminate
his
career
in
that
ignoble
sphere
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
but
Hugh
,
who
have
a
sight
as
keen
as
any
hawk
's
,
and
,
apart
from
that
endowment
,
could
have
find
his
way
blindfold
to
any
place
within
a
dozen
mile
,
drag
old
John
along
,
quite
deaf
to
his
remonstrance
,
and
take
his
own
course
without
the
slight
reference
to
,
or
notice
of
,
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
make
head
against
the
wind
as
they
best
could
;
<EOS>
Hugh
crush
the
wet
grass
beneath
his
heavy
tread
,
and
stalk
on
after
his
ordinary
savage
fashion
;
John
Willet
follow
at
arm
's
length
,
pick
his
step
,
and
look
about
him
,
now
for
bog

ditch

and
now
for
such
stray
ghost
as
may
be
wander
abroad

with
look
of
as
much
dismay
and
uneasiness
as
his
immovable
face
be
capable
of
express

<EOS>
at
length
they
stand
upon

broad

walk
before

profoundly
dark

themselves

<EOS>
from
one
solitary
turret

chamber

however

there
shine
a
ray
of
light
;
and
towards
this
speck
of
comfort
in
the
cold

cheerless

silent
scene

Mr
Willet
bid
his
pilot
lead
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
the

upward

ask
Hugh

hold
the
lantern
to
his

to
keep
the
candle
from

trim
it
with

"
Snug

John
indignantly

<EOS>
"
You

bad

<EOS>
cry
Hugh
,
look
into
John
's
fat
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
it
keep
out
the
rain

and
snow

wind

the
less
for

it

<EOS>
Mr
Willet
fix
his
dull
eye
on
his
follower
,
and
begin
---
by
a
species
of
inspiration
---
to
think
it
just
barely
possible
that
he
be
something
of
a
dangerous
character
,
and
that
it
may
be
advisable
to
get
rid
of
him
one
of
these
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
too
prudent
to
say
anything
,
with
the
journey
home
before
him
;
and
therefore
turn
to
the
iron
gate
before
which
this
brief
dialogue
have
pass
,
and
pull
the
handle
of
the
bell
that
hang
beside
it

<EOS>
the
turret
in
which
the
light
appear

only
divide
from

path
by
one

upon

this
gate
open
<EOS>

Mr

throw
up
the

directly

<EOS>
"

John

I

close

He
presently
appear
at
a
door
in

hold
it
more
steadily

ascend
first

round
from

shed
his
light
downward

story
move
his
auditor
much
more
than
he
have
expect

<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
often
change
his
attitude
,
rise
and
pace
the
room
,
return
again
,
desire
him
to
repeat
,
as
nearly
as
he
could
,
the
very
word
that
Solomon
have
use
,
and
give
so
many
other
sign
of
be
disturb
and
ill
at
ease
,
that
even
Mr

be
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
quite
right
,
"
he
say
,
at
the
end
of
a
long
conversation
,
"
to
bid
them
keep
this
story
secret
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
foolish
fancy
on
the
part
of
this
weak
-
brained
man
,
breed
in
his
fear
and
superstition
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Haredale
,
though
she
would
know
it
to
be
so
,
would
be
disturb
by
it
if
it
reach
her
ear
;
it
be
too
nearly
connected
with
a
subject
very
painful
to
us
all
,
to
be
hear
with
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
most
prudent
,
and
have
lay
me
under
a
great
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
equal
to
John
's
most
sanguine
expectation
;
but
he
would
have
prefer
Mr
Haredale
be
look
at
him
when
he
speak
,
as
if
he
really
do
thank
him
,
to
his
walking
up
and
down
,
speak
by
fit
and
start
,
often
stop
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
ground
,
move
hurriedly
on
again
,
like
one
distract
,
and
seem
almost
unconscious
of
what
he
say
or
do
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
his
manner
;
and
it
be
so
embarrassing
to
John
that
he
sit
quite
passive
for
a
long
time
,
not
know
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
rise
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
stare
at
him
for
a
moment
as
though
he
have
quite
forget
his

present

then
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
open
the
door

<EOS>
Hugh

"
Will

He

"
  
<EOS>
as
John
make
no
reply
,
Mr
Haredale
bring
out
a
glass
of
liquor
,
and
give
it
to
Hugh
,
who
,
as
he
take
it
in
his
hand
,
throw
part
of
it
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
splash
your
drink
about
a
gentleman

house
,

say
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
drink
a
toast

"
Hugh
rejoin
,
hold
the
glass
above
his
head
,
and
fix
his
eye
on
Mr
Haredale
's
face
;
"
a
toast
to
this
house
and
its
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
that
he
mutter
something
to
himself
,
and
drank
the
rest
,
and
set
down
the
glass
,
precede
them
without
another
word
.
  
<EOS>
John
be
a
good
deal
scandalise
by
this
observance
,
but
see
that
Mr
Haredale
take
little
heed
of
what
Hugh
say
or
do
,
and
that
his
thought
be
otherwise
employ
,
he
offer
no
apology
,
and
go
in
silence
down
the
stair
,
across
the
walk
,
and
through
the
garden
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
They
stop
upon
the
outer
side
for
Hugh
to
hold
the
light
while
Mr
Haredale
lock
it
on
the
inner
;
and
then
John
see
with
wonder
(
as
he
often
afterwards
relate
)
,
that
he
be
very
pale
,
and
that
his
face
have
change
so
much
and
grow
so
haggard
since
their
entrance
,
that
he
almost
seem
another
man
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
in
the
open
road
again
,
and
John
Willet
be
walk
on
behind
his
escort
,
as
he
have
come
,
think
very
steadily
of
what
be
have
just
now
see
,
when
Hugh
draw
him
suddenly
aside
,
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
three
horseman
sweep
past
---
the
near
brush
his
shoulder
even
then
---
who
,
check
their
steed
as
suddenly
as
they
could
,
stand
still

and
wait
for
their

Chapter

when
John
Willet
see
that
the
horseman
wheel
smartly
round
,
and
draw
up
three
abreast
in
the
narrow
road
,
wait
for
him
and
his
man
to
join
them
,
it
occur
to
him
with
unusual
precipitation
that
they
must
be
highwayman
;
and
have
Hugh
be
arm
with
a
blunderbuss
,
in
place
of
his
stout
cudgel
,
he
would
certainly
have
order
him
to
fire
it
off
at
a
venture
,
and
would
,
while
the
word
of
command
be
obey
,
have
consult
his
own
personal
safety
in
immediate
flight
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
circumstance
of
disadvantage
,
however
,
in
which
he
and
his
guard
be
place
,
he
deem
it
prudent
to
adopt
a
different
style
of
generalship
,
and
therefore
whisper
his
attendant
to
address
them
in
the
most
peaceable
and
courteous
term
.
 
<EOS>
by
way
of
act
up
to
the
spirit
and
letter
of
this
instruction
,
Hugh
step
forward
,
and
flourish
his
staff
before
the
very
eye
of
the
rider
near
to
him
,
demand
roughly
what
he
and
his
fellow
mean
by
so
nearly
gallop
over
them
,
and
why
they
scour
the
king
's
highway
at
that
late
hour
of
night
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
whom
be

begin
an
angry
reply
in
the

strain
,
when
be
be
check
by
the
horseman
in
the
centre
,
who
,
interpose
with
an
air
of
authority
,
inquire
in
a
somewhat
loud
but
not
harsh
or
unpleasant
voice
:
  
"
Pray

Hugh
roughly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

an
inducement

the
traveller
to
ride
away

the
look
of
the
landlord
's
friend
be
not
over
honest
,
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
be
cautious
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
John
Grueby
be
quite
right
,
"
interpose
Mr
Gashford
,
fall
back
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
a
life
so
precious
as
yours
must
not
be
put
in
peril
.
 
<EOS>
go
forward
,
John
,
by
all
mean
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
reason
to
suspect
the
fellow
,
blow
his
brain
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
make
no
answer
,
but
look
straight
before
him
,
as
his
custom
seem
to
be
when
the
secretary
speak
,
bade
Hugh
push
on
,
and
follow
close
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
his
lordship
,
with
Mr
Willet
at
his
bridle
rein
;
and
,
last
of
all
,
his
lordship
's
secretary
---
for
that
,
it
seem
,
be
Gashford
's
office
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
strode
briskly
on
,
often
look
back
at
the
servant
,
whose
horse
be
close
upon
his
heel
,
and
glance
with
a
leer
at
his
bolster
case
of
pistol
,
by
which
he
seem
to
set
great
store
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
square
-
build
,
strong
-
make
,
bull
-
necked
fellow
,
of
the
true
english
breed
;
and
as
Hugh
measure
him
with
his
eye
,
he
measure
Hugh
,
regard
him
meanwhile
with
a
look
of
bluff
disdain
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
much
old
than
the
Maypole
man
,
be
to
all
appearance
five
-
and
-
forty
;
but
be
one
of
those
self
-
possess
,
hard
-
headed
,
imperturbable
fellow
,
who
,
if
they
be
ever
beat
at
fisticuff
,
or
other
kind
of
warfare
,
never
know
it
,
and
go
on
coolly
till
they
win
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
lead
you
wrong
now
,
"
say
Hugh
,
tauntingly
,
"
<EOS>
you
would
---
ha
ha
ha
!
---
 
<EOS>
you
would
shoot
me
through
the
head
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
John
Grueby
take
no
more
notice
of
this
remark
than
if
he
have
be
deaf
and
Hugh
dumb
;
but
keep
ride
on
quite
comfortably
,
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
try
a
fall
with
a
man
when
you
be
young
,
master
?
"
say
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
make
any
play
at
single
-
stick
?
"
  
<EOS>
John
Grueby
look
at
him
sideway
with
the
same
contented
air
,
but
deign
not
a
word
in
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
like
this
?
"
say
Hugh
,
give
his
cudgel
one
of
those
skilful
flourish
,
in
which
the
rustic
of
that
time
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whoop
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
---
or
that
,
"
return
John
Grueby
,
beat
down
his
guard
with
his
whip
,
and
strike
him
on
the
head
with
its
butt
end
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
play
a
little
once
.
 
<EOS>
You
wear
your
hair
too
long
;
I
should
have
crack
your
crown
if
it
have
be
a
little
short
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
smart
,
loud
-
sound
rap
,
as
it
be
,
and
evidently
astonish
Hugh
;
who
,
for
the
moment
,
seem
disposed
to
drag
his
new
acquaintance
from
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
face
betoken
neither
malice
,
triumph
,
rage
,
nor
any
linger
idea
that
he
have
give
him
offence
;
his
eye
gaze
steadily
in
the
old
direction
,
and
his
manner
be
as
careless
and
compose
as
if
he
have
merely
brush
away
a
fly
;
Hugh
be
so
puzzled
,
and
so
disposed
to
look
upon
him
as
a
customer
of
almost
supernatural
toughness
,
that
he
merely
laugh
,
and
cry
"
well
do
!
"
<EOS>
then
,
sheer
off
a
little
,
lead
the
way
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
before
the
lapse
of
many
minute
the
party
halt
at
the
Maypole
door
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
his
secretary
quickly
dismount
,
give
their
horse
to
their
servant
,
who
,
under
the
guidance
of
Hugh
,
repair
to
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
right
glad
to
escape
from
the
inclemency
of
the
night
,
they
follow
Mr
Willet
into
the
common
room
,
and
stand
warm
themselves
and
dry
their
clothe
before
the
cheerful
fire
,
while
he
busy
himself
with
such
order
and
preparation
as
his
guest
's
high
quality
require
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
bustle
in
and
out
of
the
room
,
intent
on
these
arrangement
,
he
have
an
opportunity
of
observe
the
two
traveller
,
of
whom
,
as
yet
,
he
know
nothing
but
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
the
lord
,
the
great
personage
who
do
the
Maypole
so
much
honour
,
be
about
the
middle
height
,
of
a
slender
make
,
and
sallow
complexion
,
with
an
aquiline
nose
,
and
long
hair
of
a
reddish
brown
,
comb
perfectly
straight
and
smooth
about
his
ear
,
and
slightly
powder
,
but
without
the
faint
vestige
of
a
curl
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
attire
,
under
his
greatcoat
,
in
a
full
suit
of
black
,
quite
free
from
any
ornament
,
and
of
the
most
precise
and
sober
cut
.
 
<EOS>
the
gravity
of
his
dress
,
together
with
a
certain
lankness
of
cheek
and
stiffness
of
deportment
,
add
nearly
ten
year
to
his
age
,
but
his
figure
be
that
of
one
not
yet
past
thirty
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
stand
muse
in
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
,
it
be
strike
to
observe
his
very
bright
large
eye
,
which
betray
a
restlessness
of
thought
and
purpose
,
singularly
at
variance
with
the
study
composure
and
sobriety
of
his
mien
,
and
with
his
quaint
and
sad
apparel
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
nothing
harsh
or
cruel
in
its
expression
;
neither
have
his
face
,
which
be
thin
and
mild
,
and
wear
an
air
of
melancholy
;
but
it
be
suggestive
of
an
indefinable
uneasiness
;
which
infect
those
who
look
upon
him
,
and
fill
them
with
a
kind
of
pity
for
the
man
:
<EOS>
though
why
it
do
so
,
they
would
have
have
some
trouble
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
Gashford
,
the
secretary
,
be
tall
,
angularly
make
,
high
-
shouldered
,
bony
,
and
ungraceful
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
,
in
imitation
of
his
superior
,
be
demure
and
staid
in
the
extreme
;
his
manner
,
formal
and
constrain
.
 
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
an
overhang
brow
,
great
hand
and
foot
and
ear
,
and
a
pair
of
eye
that
seem
to
have
make
an
unnatural
retreat
into
his
head
,
and
to
have
dig
themselves
a
cave
to
hide
in
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
be
smooth
and
humble
,
but
very
sly
and
slinking
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
the
aspect
of
a
man
who
be
always
lie
in
wait
for
something
that
WOULDN'T
come
to
pass
;
but
he
look
patient
---
very
patient
---
and
fawn
like
a
spaniel
dog
.
 
<EOS>
even
now
,
while
he
warm
and
rub
his
hand
before
the
blaze
,
he
have
the
air
of
one
who
only
presume
to
enjoy
it
in
his
degree
as
a
commoner
;
and
though
he
know
his
lord
be
not
regard
him
,
he
look
into
his
face
from
time
to
time
,
and
with
a
meek
and
deferential
manner
,
smile
as
if
for
practice
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
guest
whom
old
John
Willet
,
with
a
fix
and
leaden
eye
,
survey
a
hundred
time
,
and
to
whom
he
now
advance
with
a
state
candlestick
in
each
hand
,
beseech
them
to
follow
him
into
a
worthy
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
my
lord
,
"
say
John
<EOS>
---
it
be
odd
enough
,
but
certain
people
seem
to
have
as
great
a
pleasure
in
pronounce
title
as
their
owner
have
in
wear
them
---
"
this
room
,
my
lord
,
be
not
at
all
the
sort
of
place
for
your
lordship
,
and
I
have
to
beg
your
lordship
's
pardon
for
keep
you
here
,
my
lord
,
one
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
address
,
John
usher
them
upstairs
into
the
state
apartment
,
which
,
like
many
other
thing
of
state
,
be
cold
and
comfortless
.
 
<EOS>
Their
own
footstep
,
reverberate
through
the
spacious
room
,
strike
upon
their
hearing
with
a
hollow
sound
;
and
its
damp
and
chilly
atmosphere
be
render
doubly
cheerless
by
contrast
with
the
homely
warmth
they
have
desert
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
,
however
,
to
propose
a
return
to
the
place
they
have
quit
,
for
the
preparation
go
on
so
briskly
that
there
be
no
time
to
stop
them
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
with
the
tall
candlestick
in
his
hand
,
bow
them
up
to
the
fireplace
;
Hugh
,
stride
in
with
a
light
brand
and
pile
of
firewood
,
cast
it
down
upon
the
hearth
,
and
set
it
in
a
blaze
;
John
Grueby
(
who
have
a
great
blue
cockade
in
his
hat
,
which
he
appear
to
despise
mightily
)
bring
in
the
portmanteau
he
have
carry
on
his
horse

place
it
on
the
floor
;

presently

<EOS>
in
less

supper
have
be
serve

clear
away

Lord

his

,
with
slippered
foot

and
leg
stretch
out
before
the
fire
,
sit
over
some
hot
mulled

seem
to
read
the
inscription
on
the
seal
,
abstractedly
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
slight
action
possible
,
not
obtrude
on
his
notice
,
and
apparently
the
result
of
a
moment
's
absence
of
mind
,
not
worth
remark
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
word
be
utter
,
Lord
George
,
who
have
be
go
on
impetuously
,
stop
short
,
redden
,
and
be
silent
.
<EOS>
apparently
quite
unconscious
of
this
change
in
his
demeanour
,
the
wily
Secretary
step
a
little
apart
,
under
pretence
of
pull
up
the
window
-
blind
,
and
return
when
the
other
have
have
time
to
recover
,
say
:
  
"
the
holy
cause
go
bravely
on
,
my
lord
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
idle
,
even
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
drop
two
of
the
handbill
before
I
go
to
bed
,
and
both
be
go
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
in
the
house
have
mention
the
circumstance
of
find
them
,
though
I
have
be
downstairs
full
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
one
or
two
recruit
will
be
their
first
fruit
,
I
predict
;
and
who
shall
say
how
many
more
,
with
Heaven
's
blessing
on
your
inspire
exertion
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
famous
device
in
the
beginning
,
"
reply
Lord
George
;
"
an
excellent
device
,
and
do
good
service
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
worthy
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
remind
me
not
to
be
a
sluggard
,
Gashford
,
when
the
vineyard
be
menace
with
destruction
,
and
may
be
trodden
down
by
papist
foot
.
 
<EOS>
let
the
horse
be
saddle
in
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
up
and
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
this
with
a
heightened
colour
,
and
in
a
tone
of
such
enthusiasm
,
that
the
secretary
deem
all
further
prompt
needless
,
and
withdraw
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
dream
he
be
a
Jew
,
"
he
say
thoughtfully
,
as
he
close
the
bedroom
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
come
to
that
before
he
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
enough
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
and
provide
I
lose
nothing
by
it
,
I
do
not
see
why
that
religion
should
not
suit
me
as
well
as
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
rich
man
among
the
Jews
;
shaving
be
very
troublesome
;
---
yes
,
it
would
suit
me
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
though
,
we
must
be
christian
to
the
core
.
 
<EOS>
Our
prophetic
motto
will
suit
all
creed
in
their
turn
,
that
be
a
comfort
.
"
 
<EOS>
reflect
on
this
source
of
consolation
,
he
reach
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
ring
the
bell
for
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
be
quickly
dress
(
for
his
plain
toilet
be
easily
make
)
,
and
as
he
be
no
less
frugal
in
his
repast
than
in
his
Puritan
attire
,
his
share
of
the
meal
be
soon
dispatch
.
 
<EOS>
the
secretary
,
however
,
more
devoted
to
the
good
thing
of
this
world
,
or
more
intent
on
sustain
his
strength
and
spirit
for
the
sake
of
the
Protestant
cause
,
ate
and
drink
to
the
last
minute
,
and
require
indeed
some
three
or
four
reminder
from
John
Grueby
,
before
he
could
resolve
to
tear
himself
away
from
Mr
Willet
's
plentiful
providing
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
he
come
downstairs
,
wipe
his
greasy
mouth
,
and
have
pay
John
Willet
's
bill
,
climb
into
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
who
have
be
walk
up
and
down
before
the
house
talk
to
himself
with
earnest
gesture
,
mount
his
horse
;
and
return
old
John
Willet
's
stately
bow
,
as
well
as
the
parting
salutation
of
a
dozen
idler
whom
the
rumour
of
a
live
lord
be
about
to
leave
the
Maypole
have
gather
round
the
porch
,
they
ride
away
,
with
stout
John
Grueby
in
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
if
Lord
George
Gordon
have
appear
in
the
eye
of
Mr
Willet
,
overnight
,
a
nobleman
of
somewhat
quaint
and
odd
exterior
,
the
impression
be
confirm
this
morning
,
and
increase
a
hundredfold
.
<EOS>
sit
bolt
upright
upon
his
bony
steed
,
with
his
long
,
straight
hair
,
dangle
about
his
face
and
flutter
in
the
wind
;
his
limb
all
angular
and
rigid
,
his
elbow
stick
out
on
either
side
ungracefully
,
and
his
whole
frame
jog
and
shake
at
every
motion
of
his
horse
's
foot
;
a
more
grotesque
or
more
ungainly
figure
can
hardly
be
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
in
lieu
of
whip
,
he
carry
in
his
hand
a
great
gold
-
head
cane
,
as
large
as
any
footman
carry
in
these
day
,
and
his
various
mode
of
hold
this
unwieldy
weapon
---
now
upright
before
his
face
like
the
sabre
of
a
horse
-
soldier
,
now
over
his
shoulder
like
a
musket
,
now
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
but
always
in
some
uncouth
and
awkward
fashion
---
contribute
in
no
small
degree
to
the
absurdity
of
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Stiff
,
lank
,
and
solemn
,
dress
in
an
unusual
manner
,
and
ostentatiously
exhibit
---
whether
by
design
or
accident
---
all
his
peculiarity
of
carriage
,
gesture
,
and
conduct
,
all
the
quality
,
natural
and
artificial
,
in
which
he
differ
from
other
man
<EOS>
;
he
may
have
move
the
stern
looker
-
on
to
laughter
,
and
fully
provoke
the
smile
and
whisper
jest
which
greet
his
departure
from
the
Maypole
inn
.
  
<EOS>
quite
unconscious
,
however
,
of
the
effect
he
produce
,
he
trot
on
beside
his
secretary
,
talk
to
himself
nearly
all
the
way
,
until
they
come
within
a
mile
or
two
of
London
,
when
now
and
then
some
passenger
go
by
who
know
him
by
sight
,
and
point
him
out
to
some
one
else
,
and
perhaps
stand
look
after
him
,
or
cry
in
jest
or
earnest
as
it
may
be
,
"
Hurrah
Geordie
!
 
<EOS>
no
popery
!
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
he
would
gravely
pull
off
his
hat
,
and
bow
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
reach
the
town
and
ride
along
the
street
,
these
notice
become
more
frequent
;
some
laugh
,
some
hiss
,
some
turn
their
head
and
smile
,
some
wonder
who
he
be
,
some
run
along
the
pavement
by
his
side
and
cheer
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
happen
in
a
crush
of
cart
and
chair
and
coach
,
he
would
make
a
dead
stop
,
and
pull
off
his
hat
,
cry
,
"
gentleman
,
no
popery
!
"
to
which
the
gentleman
would
respond
with
lusty
voice
,
and
with
three
time
three
;
and
then
,
on
he
would
go
again
with
a
score
or
so
of
the
ragged
,
follow
at
his
horse
's
heel
,
and
shout
till
their
throat
be
parch
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
lady
too
---
there
be
a
great
many
old
lady
in
the
street
,
and
these
all
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
---
not
those
of
the
high
rank
,
but
such
as
sell
fruit
from
basket
and
carry
burden
---
clap
their
shrivel
hand
,
and
raise
a
weazen
,
piping
,
shrill
"
Hurrah
,
my
lord
.
"
 
<EOS>
other
wave
their
hand
or
handkerchief
,
or
shake
their
fan
or
parasol
,
or
throw
up
window
and
call
in
haste
to
those
within
,
to
come
and
see
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
mark
of
popular
esteem
<EOS>
,
he
receive
with
profound
gravity
and
respect
;
bow
very
low
,
and
so
frequently
that
his
hat
be
more
off
his
head
than
on
;
and
look
up
at
the
house
as
he
pass
along
,
with
the
air
of
one
who
be
make
a
public
entry
,
and
yet
be
not
puff
up
or
proud
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
ride
(
to
the
deep
and
unspeakable
disgust
of
John
Grueby
)
<EOS>
the
whole
length
of
Whitechapel
,
Leadenhall
Street
,
and
Cheapside
,
and
into
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
close
to
the
cathedral
,
he
halt
;
speak
to
Gashford
;
and
look
upward
at
its
lofty
dome
,
shake
his
head
,
as
though
he
say
,
"
the
Church
in
Danger
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
to
be
sure
,
the
bystander
stretch
their
throat
indeed
;
and
he
go
on
again
with
mighty
acclamation
from
the
mob
,
and
low
bow
than
ever

<EOS>
so
along
the
Strand

up
Swallow

<EOS>
good

<EOS>
God

<EOS>
this
be
rather
a
short
address
than
they
expect
,
be
receive
with
some
displeasure
,
and
cry
of
"
a
speech

<EOS>
a
speech
!
"
which

<EOS>
"
You

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"

a
deep
,
gruff
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
look
of
it
,
"
say
John
Grueby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would

so
small
and
near
together

that
his
broken

about
his

His

be
of
threadbare

rusty

whitened
black

discolour
with

give
loose
to
these
and
other
demonstration
of
their
patriotic
purpose
;
and
be
about
to
make
some
remark
aloud
,
when
Dennis
,
step
up
to
him
,
and
shade
his
mouth
with
his
hand
,
say
,
in
a
hoarse
whisper
,
as
he
nudge
him
with
his
elbow
:
  
"
do
not
split
upon
a
constitutional
officer
's
profession
,
Muster
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
popular
prejudice
,
you
know
,
and
he
might
not
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
wait
till
he
come
to
be
more
intimate
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
fine
-
build
chap
,
an't
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
powerful
fellow
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
whisper
Dennis
,
with
a
horrible
kind
of
admiration
,
such
as
that
with
which
a
cannibal
may
regard
his
intimate
friend
,
when
hungry
<EOS>
,
---
"
do
you
ever
---
and
here
he
draw
still
closer
to
his
ear
,
and
fence
his
mouth
with
both
his
open
band
---
"
see
such
a
throat
as
his
?
 
<EOS>
do
but
cast
your
eye
upon
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
neck
for
stretch
,
Muster
Gashford
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
secretary
assent
to
this
proposition
with
the
good
grace
he
could
assume
---
it
be
difficult
to
feign
a
true
professional
relish
:
which
be
eccentric
sometimes
---
and
after
ask
the
candidate
a
few
unimportant
question
,
proceed
to
enrol
him
a
member
of
the
Great
Protestant
Association
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
if
anything
could
have
exceed
Mr
Dennis
's
joy
on
the
happy
conclusion
of
this
ceremony
,
it
would
have
be
the
rapture
with
which
he
receive
the
announcement
that
the
new
member
could
neither
read
nor
write
:
those
two
art
be
(
as
Mr
Dennis
swear
)
the
great
possible
curse
a
civilised
community
could
know
,
and
militate
more
against
the
professional
emolument
and
usefulness
of
the
great
constitutional
office
he
have
the
honour
to
hold
,
than
any
adverse
circumstance
that
could
present
themselves
to
his
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
the
enrolment
be
complete
,
and
Hugh
have
be
inform
by
Gashford
,
in
his
peculiar
manner
,
of
the
peaceful
and
strictly
lawful
object
contemplate
by
the
body
to
which
he
now
belong
---
 
during
which
recital
Mr
Dennis
nudge
him
very
much
with
his
elbow
,
and
make
diver
remarkable
face
---
the
secretary
give
them
both
to
understand
that
he
desire
to
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
they
take
their
leave
without
delay
,
and
come
out
of
the
house
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
walk
,
brother
?
"
say
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
"
return
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
social
,
"
say
his
new
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
which
way
shall
we
take
?
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
and
have
a
look
at
door
that
we
shall
make
a
pretty
good
clattering
at
,
before
long
---
eh
,
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
they
go
slowly
down
to
Westminster
,
where
both
house
of
Parliament
be
then
sit
.
<EOS>
mingle
in
the
crowd
of
carriage
,
horse
,
servant
,
chairman
,
link
-
boy
,
porter
,
and
idler
of
all
kind
,
they
lounge
about
;
while
Hugh
's
new
friend
point
out
to
him
significantly
the
weak
part
of
the
building
,
how
easy
it
be
to
get
into
the
lobby
,
and
so
to
the
very
door
of
the
House
of
Commons
;
and
how
plainly
,
when
they
march
down
there
in
grand
array
,
their
roar
and
shout
would
be
hear
by
the
member
inside
;
with
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
all
of
which
Hugh
receive
with
manifest
delight
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
him
,
too
,
who
some
of
the
Lords
and
Commons
be
,
by
name
,
as
they
come
in
and
out
;
whether
they
be
friendly
to
the
Papists
or
otherwise
;
and
bade
him
take
notice
of
their
livery
and
equipage
,
that
he
may
be
sure
of
them
,
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
draw
him
close
to
the
window
of
a
pass
carriage
,
that
he
may
see
its
master
's
face
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
;
and
,
both
in
respect
of
people
and
locality
,
he
show
so
much
acquaintance
with
everything
around
,
that
it
be
plain
he
have
often
study
there
before
;
<EOS>
as
indeed
,
when
they
grow
a
little
more
confidential
,
he
confess
he
have
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
most
striking
part
of
all
this
be
,
the
number
of
people
---
never
in
group
of
more
than
two
or
three
together
---
who
seem
to
be
skulk
about
the
crowd
for
the
same
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
great
part
of
these
,
a
slight
nod
or
a
look
from
Hugh
's
companion
be
sufficient
greeting
;
but
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
some
man
would
come
and
stand
beside
him
in
the
throng
,
and
,
without
turn
his
head
or
appear
to
communicate
with
him
<EOS>
,
would
say
a
word
or
two
in
a
low
voice
,
which
he
would
answer
in
the
same
cautious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
would
part
,
like
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
man
often
reappear
again
unexpectedly
in
the
crowd
close
to
Hugh
,
and
,
as
they
pass
by
,
press
his
hand
,
or
look
him
sternly
in
the
face
;
but
they
never
speak
to
him
,
nor
he
to
them
;
no
,
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
,
too
,
that
whenever
they
happen
to
stand
where
there
be
any
press
of
people
,
and
Hugh
chance
to
be
look
downward
,
he
be
sure
to
see
an
arm
stretch
out
---
under
his
own
perhaps
,
or
perhaps
across
him
---
which
thrust
some
paper
into
the
hand
or
pocket
of
a
bystander
,
and
be
so
suddenly
withdraw
that
it
be
impossible
to
tell
from
whom
it
come
;
nor
could
he
see
in
any
face
,
on
glance
quickly
round
,
the
least
confusion
or
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
They
often
tread
upon
a
paper
like
the
one
he
carry
in
his
breast
,
but
his
companion
whisper
him
not
to
touch
it
or
to
take
it
up
,
---
not
even
to
look
towards
it
,
---
<EOS>
so
there
they
let
them
lie
,
and
pass
on
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
parade
the
street
and
all
the
avenue
of
the
building
in
this
manner
for
near
two
hour
,
they
turn
away
,
and
his
friend
ask
him
what
he
think
of
what
he
have
see
,
and
whether
he
be
prepare
for
a
good
hot
piece
of
work
if
it
should
come
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
the
hotter
the
well
,
"
say
Hugh
,
"
I
be
prepared
for
anything
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
so
be
I
,
"
say
his
friend
,
"
and
so
be
many
of
us
;
and
they
shake
hand
upon
it
with
a
great
oath
,
and
with
many
terrible
imprecation
on
the
Papists
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
be
thirsty
by
this
time
,
Dennis
propose
that
they
should
repair
together
to
the
Boot
,
where
there
be
good
company
and
strong
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
yield
a
ready
assent
,
they
bend
their
step
that
way
with
no
loss
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
this
Boot
be
a
lone
house
of
public
entertainment
,
situate
in
the
field
at
the
back
of
the
Foundling
Hospital
;
a
very
solitary
spot
at
that
period
,
and
quite
desert
after
dark
.
 
<EOS>
the
tavern
stand
at
some
distance
from
any
high
road
,
and
be
approachable
only
by
a
dark
and
narrow
lane
;
so
that
Hugh
be
much
surprised
to
find
several
people
drink
there
,
and
great
merriment
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
still
more
surprised
to
find
among
them
almost
every
face
that
have
catch
his
attention
in
the
crowd
;
but
his
companion
have
whisper
him
outside
the
door
,
that
it
be
not
consider
good
manner
at
the
Boot
to
appear
at
all
curious
about
the
company
,
he
keep
his
own
counsel
,
and
make
no
show
of
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
before
put
his
lip
to
the
liquor
which
be
bring
for
them
,
Dennis
drink
in
a
loud
voice
the
health
of
Lord
George
Gordon
,
President
of
the
Great
Protestant
Association
;
which
toast
Hugh
pledge
likewise
,
with
corresponding
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
a
fiddler
who
be
present
,
and
who
appear
to
act
as
the
appoint
minstrel
of
the
company
,
forthwith
strike
up
a
Scotch
reel
;
and
that
in
tone
so
invigorate
,
that
Hugh
and
his
friend
(
who
have
both
be
drink
before
)
rise
from
their
seat
as
by
previous
concert
,
and
,
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
assemble
guest
,
perform
an
extemporaneous
no

Popery
Dance
.

<EOS>
the
applause
which
the
performance
of
Hugh
and
his
new
friend
elicit
from
the
company
at
the
Boot
,
have
not
yet
subside
,
and
the
two
dancer
be
still
pant
from
their
exertion
,
which
have
be
of
a
rather
extreme
and
violent
character
,
when
the
party
be
reinforce
by
the
arrival
of
some
more
guest
,
who
,
be

detachment
of
United

with
very
flattering
mark
of
distinction
and
respect
.
  
<EOS>
the
leader
of
this
small
party

for

himself

they
be
but
three
in
number

be
our
old
acquaintance
,
Mr
Tappertit

who
seem
,
physically
speak
,
to
have
grow
small
with
year
(
particularly
as
to
his
leg
,
which
be
stupendously
little
)
,
but
who
,
in
a
moral
point
of
view
,
in
personal
dignity
and
self
-
esteem
,
have
swell
into
a
giant
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
it
by
any
mean
difficult
for
the
most
unobservant
person
to
detect
this
state
of
feeling
in
the
quondam
'
prentice
,
for
it
not
only
proclaim
itself
impressively
and
beyond
mistake
in
his
majestic
walk
and
kindle
eye
,
but
find
a
striking
mean
of
revelation
in
his
turn
-
up
nose
,
which
scout
all
thing
of
earth
with
deep
disdain
,
and
seek
communion
with
its
kindred
sky
.

Mr
Tappertit

as
chief
or
captain
of
the
Bulldogs

lieutenant

in

of

bind
in
the
olden
time
to
Thomas

these
gentleman
,
like
himself
,
be
now
emancipate
from
their

thraldom
,
and
serve
as
journeyman

but
they
be
,
in
humble
emulation
of
his
great
example
,
bold
and
daring
spirit
,
and
aspire
to
a
distinguished
state
in
great
political
event

<EOS>
hence
their
connection
with
the
Protestant
Association
of
England

sanction
by
the

hence
their

"

the

company
implicitly
subscribe
to
this
opinion
,
and
testify
their
faith
in
Hugh
by
nod
and
look
of
great
significance

<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
sit
and
contemplate
him
for
a
long
time
in
silence

as
if
he
suspend
his
judgment

then
draw
a

nearer

<EOS>
Hugh
laugh
again
,
and
with
such
thorough
abandonment
to
his
mad
humour
,
that
his
limb
seem
dislocate
,
and
his
whole
frame
in
danger
of
tumble
to
piece
;
but
Mr
Tappertit
,
so
far
from
receive
this
extreme
merriment
with
any
irritation
,
be
pleased
to
regard
it
with
the
utmost
favour
,
and
even
to
join
in
it
,
so
far
as
one
of
his
gravity
and
station
could
,
with
any
regard
to
that
decency
and
decorum
which
man
in
high
place
be
expect
to
maintain
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
do
not
stop
here
,
as
many
public
character
may
have
do
,
but
call
up
his
brace
of
lieutenant
,
introduce
Hugh
to
them
with
high
commendation
;
declare
him
to
be
a
man
who
,
at
such
time
as
those
in
which
they
live
,
could
not
be
too
much
cherish
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
he
do
him
the
honour
to
remark
,
that
he
would
be
an
acquisition
of
which
even
the
United
Bulldogs
may
be
proud
;
and
finding
,
upon
sound
him
,
that
he
be
quite
ready
and
willing
to
enter
the
society
(
for
he
be
not
at
all
particular
,
and
would
have
league
himself
that
night
with
anything
,
or
anybody
,
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
)
,
cause
the
necessary
preliminary
to
be
go
into
upon
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
this
tribute
to
his
great
merit
delight
no
man
more
than
Mr
Dennis
,
as
he
himself
proclaim
with
several
rare
and
surprising
oath
;
and
indeed
it
give
unmingle
satisfaction
to
the
whole
assembly
.
  
<EOS>
"
make
anything
you
like
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Hugh
,
flourish
the
can
he
have
empty
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
put
me
on
any
duty
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
your
man

<EOS>
I
will
do
it

<EOS>
here
be
my
captain

here
be
my
leader
.
 
<EOS>
ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
let
him
give
me
the
word
of
command
,
and
I
will
fight
the
whole
Parliament
House
single
-
handed
,
or
set
a
light
torch
to
the
King
's
throne
itself
!
"
 
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
smite
Mr
Tappertit
on
the
back
,
with
such
violence
that
his
little
body
seem
to
shrink
into
a
mere
nothing
;
and
roar
again
until
the
very
foundling
near
at
hand
be
startle
in
their
bed
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
a
sense
of
something
whimsical
in
their
companionship
seem
to
have
take
entire
possession
of
his
rude
brain
.
 
<EOS>
the
bare
fact
of
be
patronise
by
a
great
man
whom
he
could
have
crush
with
one
hand
,
appear
in
his
eye
so
eccentric
and
humorous
,
that
a
kind
of
ferocious
merriment
gain
the
mastery
over
him
,
and
quite
subdue
his
brutal
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
roar
and
roar
again
;
toast
Mr
Tappertit
a
hundred
time
;
declare
himself
a
Bulldog
to
the
core
;
and
vow
to
be
faithful
to
him
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
in
his
vein
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
compliment
Mr
Tappertit
receive
as
matter
of
course
---
 
flattering
enough
in
their
way
,
but
entirely
attributable
to
his
vast
superiority
.
 
<EOS>
His
dignified
self
-
possession
only
delight
Hugh
the
more
;
and
in
a
word
,
this
giant
and
dwarf
strike
up
a
friendship
which
bid
fair
to
be
of
long
continuance
,
as
the
one
hold
it
to
be
his
right
to
command
,
and
the
other
consider
it
an
exquisite
pleasantry
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
Hugh
by
any
mean
a
passive
follower
,
who
scruple
to
act
without
precise
and
definite
order
;
for
when
Mr
Tappertit
mount
on
an
empty
cask
which
stand
by
way
of
rostrum
in
the
room
,
and
volunteer
a
speech
upon
the
alarm
crisis
then
at
hand
,
he
place
himself
beside
the
orator
,
and
though
he
grin
from
ear
to
ear
at
every
word
he
say
,
throw
out
such
expressive
hint
to
scoffer
in
the
management
of
his
cudgel
,
that
those
who
be
at
first
the
most
disposed
to
interrupt
,
become
remarkably
attentive
,
and
be
the
loud
in
their
approbation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
all
noise
and
jest
,
however
,
at
the
Boot
,
nor
be
the
whole
party
listener
to
the
speech
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
(
which
be
a
long
,
low
-
roof
chamber
)
in
earnest
conversation
all
the
time
;
and
when
any
of
this
group
go
out
,
fresh
people
be
sure
to
come
in
soon
afterwards
and
sit
down
in
their
place
,
as
though
the
other
have
relieve
them
on
some
watch
or
duty
;
which
it
be
pretty
clear
they
do
,
for
these
change
take
place
by
the
clock
,
at
interval
of
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
these
person
whisper
very
much
among
themselves
,
and
keep
aloof
,
and
often
look
round
,
as
jealous
of
their
speech
be
overhear
;
some
two
or
three
among
them
enter
in
book
what
seem
to
be
report
from
the
other
;
when
they
be
not
thus
employ
)
<EOS>
one
of
them
would
turn
to
the
newspaper
which
be
strew
upon
the
table
,
and
from
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
,
the
Herald
,
Chronicle
,
or
Public
Advertiser
,
would
read
to
the
rest
in
a
low
voice
some
passage
have
reference
to
the
topic
in
which
they
be
all
so
deeply
interested
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
great
attraction
be
a
pamphlet
call
the
Thunderer
,
which
espouse
their
own
opinion
,
and
be
suppose
at
that
time
to
emanate
directly
from
the
Association
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
always
in
request
;
and
whether
read
aloud
,
to
an
eager
knot
of
listener
,
or
by
some
solitary
man
,
be
certain
to
be
follow
by
stormy
talking
and
excited
look
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
his
merriment
,
and
admiration
of
his
captain
,
Hugh
be
make
sensible
by
these
and
other
token
,
of
the
presence
of
an
air
of
mystery
,
akin
to
that
which
have
so
much
impressed
him
out
of
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
discard
a
sense
that
something
serious
be
go
on
,
and
that
under
the
noisy
revel
of
the
public
-
house
,
there
lurk
unseen
and
dangerous
matter
.
 
<EOS>
little
affect
by
this
,
however
,
he
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
quarter
and
would
have
remain
there
till
morning
,
but
that
his
conductor
rise
soon
after
midnight
,
to
go
home
;
Mr
Tappertit
follow
his
example
,
leave
him
no
excuse
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
all
three
leave
the
house
together
:
roar
a
No
-
popery
song
until
the
field
resound
with
the
dismal
noise
.
  
<EOS>
cheer
up
,
captain
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Hugh
,
when
they
have
roar
themselves
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
another
stave
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
,
nothing
loath
,
begin
again
;
and
so
the
three
go
staggering
on
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
shout
like
madman
,
and
defy
the
watch
with
great
valour
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
this
do
not
require
any
unusual
bravery
or
boldness
,
as
the
watchman
of
that
time
,
be
select
for
the
office
on
account
of
excessive
age
and
extraordinary
infirmity
,
have
a
custom
of
shut
themselves
up
tight
in
their
box
on
the
first
symptom
of
disturbance
,
and
remain
there
until
they
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
proceeding
,
Mr
Dennis
,
who
have
a
gruff
voice
and
lung
of
considerable
power
,
distinguish
himself
very
much
,
and
acquire
great
credit
with
his
two
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
queer
fellow
you
be

"
say
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
so
precious

close

<EOS>

answer
the
captain
instantly

beat
his

down
on

<EOS>
when
I
look
at
that
hand
,
"
say
Mr

,
shake
it
in
the
air
,

and
remember
the
helegant
bit
of
work

turn
off

I
feel
quite

to

should
ever

"
  
<EOS>
He
heave
a
deep
sigh
as
he
indulge
in
these
reflection
,
and
put
his
finger
with
an
absent
air
on
Hugh
's
throat
,
and
particularly
under
his
left
ear
,
as
if
he
be
study
the
anatomical
development
of
that
part
of
his
frame
,
shake
his
head
in
a
despondent
manner

actually
shed
tear

say
Mr

<EOS>
Mr

glance
at
the

appear
to
think
that
the
deceased

idea
of
dress
be
of
a
peculiar
and
by
no
mean
an
expensive
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
no
remark
upon
the
point
,
however
,
and
suffer
his
mysterious
companion
to
proceed
without
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
"
these
small

"
say
Dennis
,
rub
his

;
"
these
very
small

<EOS>
they
belong
to
a

I
have
often
walk
behind
this
coat
,
in

wonder
whether
it
would
ever
come
to
me
:
this

have
dance
a
hornpipe
for
another
man
,
afore
my

full
half

a

dozen

as
to
my
hat
,
"
he
say
,
take
it
off
,

whirl
it
round
upon
his
fist
---
"
Lord

there
be
something

very
ghastly

it

in
such
a
very

dismal

for

Hugh
have
not

tell
him

this

be
follow

train
of
question

he
relate

state

mode

apparent
expectation

intention

<EOS>
His
questioning
be
so
artfully
contrive
,
that
he
seem
even
in
his
own
eye
to
volunteer
all
this
information
rather
than
to
have
it
wrest
from
him
;
and
he
be
bring
to
this
state
of
feeling
so
naturally

that
when
Mr

yawn
at
length

declare
himself
quite
weary
out

he
make
a
rough
kind
of
excuse

you

I
would

in

out

touch
his
cap
with
an

depart

<EOS>
Sir
John
,
fasten
the
door
behind
him

go
back
to
his
dressing

room
,
and
sit
down
once
again
before
the
fire
,
at
which
he
gaze
for
a
long
time
,
in
earnest
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
happen
fortunately
,
"
he
say
,
break
into
a
smile
,
"
and
promise
well
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
My
relative
and
I
,
who
be
the
most
protestant
fellow
in
the
world
,
give
our
bad
wish
to
the
roman
Catholic
cause
;
and
to
Saville
,
who
introduce
their
bill
,
I
have
a
personal
objection
besides
;
but
as
each
of
us
have
himself
for
the
first
article
in
his
creed
,
we
can
not
commit
ourselves
by
join
with
a
very
extravagant
madman
,
such
as
this
Gordon
most
undoubtedly
be
.
 
<EOS>
now
really
,
to
foment
his
disturbance
in
secret
,
through
the
medium
of
such
a
very
apt
instrument
as
my
savage
friend
here
,
may
further
our
real
end
;
and
to
express
at
all
become
season
,
in
moderate
and
polite
term
,
a
disapprobation
of
his
proceeding
,
though
we
agree
with
him
in
principle
,
will
certainly
be
to
gain
a
character
for
honesty
and
uprightness
of
purpose
,
which
can
not
fail
to
do
us
infinite
service
,
and
to
raise
us
into
some
importance
.
 
<EOS>
good
!
 
<EOS>
so
much
for
public
ground
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
private
consideration
,
I
confess
that
if
these
vagabond
WOULD
make
some
riotous
demonstration
(
which
do
not
appear
impossible
)
,
and
WOULD
inflict
some
little
chastisement
on
Haredale
as
a
not
inactive
man
among
his
sect
,
it
would
be
extremely
agreeable
to
my
feeling
,
and
would
amuse
me
beyond
measure
.
 
<EOS>
good
again
!
 
<EOS>
perhaps
better
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
this
point
,
he
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
;
then
begin
slowly
to
undress
,
he
resume
his
meditation
,
by
say
with
a
smile
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
I
do
fear
exceedingly
,
that
my
friend
be
follow
fast
in
the
footstep
of
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
His
intimacy
with
Mr
Dennis
be
very
ominous
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
doubt
he
must
have
come
to
that
end
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
lend
him
a
help
hand
,
the
only
difference
be
,
that
he
may
,
upon
the
whole
,
possibly
drink
a
few
gallon
,
or
puncheon
,
or
hogshead
,
less
in
this
life
than
he
otherwise
would
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
business
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
matter
of
very
small
importance
!
"
  
<EOS>
so
he
take
another
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
go
to
bed
.

Golden
Key

there
issue
forth
a
tinkling
sound

so
merry

good

humoured

that
it
suggest
the

blithely

no

Mrs

imitation

brick

with
a
yellow

down

the
counterfeit
presentment

a
brass
plate

whereon
be
legibly
inscribe

Protestant
Association

---
and
look
at
it
,
say
,
that
it
be
to
her
a
source
of
poignant
misery
to
think
that
Varden
never
have
,
of
all
his

,
drop
anything
into
that
temple
,
save
once
in

two
fragment

that
dolly

backward

better
loving

as
it
seem
,
to
purchase
ribbon
and
such
gaud
,
than
to
encourage
the
great
cause
,
then
in
such
heavy
tribulation
;
and
that
she
do
entreat
her
(
her
father
she
much
fear
could
not
be
move
)
not
to
despise
,
but
imitate
,
the
bright
example
of
Miss
Miggs
,
who
fling
her
wage
,
as
it
be
,
into
the
very
countenance
of
the
Pope
,
and
bruise
his
feature
with
her
quarter
's
money

<EOS>
"
oh

"
say
Miggs
,
"
do
not

<EOS>
I

no

<EOS>
such
sacrifice
as
I
can
make

be
quite
a

mite

<EOS>
It
be
all
I
have
,
"
cry
Miggs
with
a
great
burst
of
tear
---
for
with
her
<EOS>
they
never
come
on
by
degree

"
but
it
be
make
up
to
me
in
other
way
;
it
be
well
make
up

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
quite
true
,
though
not
perhaps
in
the
sense
that
Miggs
intend
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
never
fail
to
keep
her
self
-
denial
full
in
Mrs
Varden
's
view
,
it
draw
forth
so
many
gift
of
cap
and
gown
and
other
article
of
dress
,
that
upon
the
whole
the
red
-
brick
house
be
perhaps
the
good
investment
for
her
small
capital
she
could
possibly
have
hit
upon
;
return
her
interest
,
at
the
rate
of
seven
or
eight
per
cent
in
money
,
and
fifty
at

in
personal
repute
and
credit

<EOS>
"
You
need
not
cry
,
Miggs
,
"
say
Mrs
Varden
,
herself
in
tear
;
"
you
need
not
be
ashamed
of
it
,
though
your
poor
mistress
be
on
the
same
side

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miggs
howl
at
this
remark
,
in
a
peculiarly
dismal
way
,
and
say
she
know
that
master
hate
her
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
live
in
family
and
have
dislike
,
and
not
give
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
that
to
make
division
be
a
thing
she
could
not
abear
to
think
of
,
neither
could
her
feeling
let
her
do
it

that
if
it

master
's
wish
<EOS>
as
she
and
him
should
part
<EOS>
,
it
be
good
they
should
part
,
and
she
hope
he
may
be
the
happy
for
it
,
and
always
wish
him
well
,
and
that
he
may
find
somebody
as
would
meet
his
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
hard
trial
,
she
say
,
to
part
from
such
a
missis
,
but
she
could
meet
any
suffering
when
her
conscience
tell
her
she
be
in
the
right
,
and
therefore
she
be
willing
even
to
go
that
length
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
,
she
add
,
that
she
could
long
survive
the
separation
,
but
,
as
she
be
hate
and
look
upon
unpleasant
,
perhaps
her
die
as
soon
as
possible
would
be
the
good
ending
for
all
party
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
affect
conclusion
,
Miss

shed
more
tear

abundantly

<EOS>
Mrs

approve
of
this
meek

incidentally
declare

article
of

that
Dolly

that

<EOS>
this
be
an
extraordinary
instance

great
prudence

policy

have
have
this
end
in

from

first
,
and
entertain
a
secret
misgiving
that
the
locksmith
(
who
be
bold
when
Dolly
be
in
question
)
would
object
,
she
have
back
Miss

up

this
point

fresh

pause

you
will
be
amazed

I

<EOS>

I

no

it

"
ah

you
need
not
shake
your
head

It
be

I
fear

You
exhaust

God

It

We
must
leave
the

Varden

I

my
present
anxiety

find

out

you
can

It
be
not
a
mere
whim

it
be
not
the
casual
revival

my

an
earnest

solemn
purpose

My

His

be
so
altered
from
its
usual
tone
,
and
his
manner
bespeak
so
much
emotion
,
that
Gabriel
,
in
his
wonder
,
could
only
sit
and
look
towards
him
in
the
darkness

and
fancy
the
expression

do

continue
Mr

if
I
be

so

you

think
me
the

some
hideous
fancy

It
be

this

that
I

no

I

quietly

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
hesitate
for
some
moment
,
and
then
reply
:
"
since
the
night
of
the
storm

<EOS>
in
short
,
since
the
last
nineteenth
of
March

"
  
<EOS>
as
though
he
fear
that
Varden
may
express
surprise

or
reason
with
him
,
he
hastily
go
on
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
think
,
I
know
,
I
labour
under
some
delusion
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
a
morbid
one
;
it
be
a
wholesome
action

reason

actual
occurrence

You
know

for

ask
the

<EOS>
"
to
pass
the
night
there

he

many
night

this

"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
as
if
to
change
the
theme
,
he
lead
the
astounded
locksmith
back
to
the
night
of
the
Maypole
highwayman
,
to
the
robbery
of
Edward
Chester
,
to
the
reappearance
of
the
man
at
Mrs
Rudge
's
house
,
and
to
all
the
strange
circumstance
which
afterwards
occur
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
ask
him
carelessly
about
the
man
's
height
,
his
face
,
his
figure
,
whether
he
be
like
any
one
he
have
ever
see
---
like
Hugh
,
for
instance
,
or
any
man
he
have
know
at
any
time
---
and
put
many
question
of
that
sort
,
which
the
locksmith
,
consider
them
as
mere
device
to
engage
his
attention
and
prevent
his
express
the
astonishment
he
feel
,
answer
pretty
much
at
random
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
they
arrive
at
the
corner
of
the
street
in
which
the
house
stand
,
where
Mr
Haredale
,
alighting
,
dismiss
the
coach
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
desire
to
see
me
safely
lodge
,
"
he
say
,
turn
to
the
locksmith
with
a
gloomy
smile
,
"
you
can

"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
to
whom
all
former
marvel
have
be
nothing
in
comparison
with
this
,
follow
him
along
the
narrow
pavement
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
reach
the
door
,
Mr
Haredale
softly
open
it
with
a
key
he
have
about
him
,
and
close
it
when
Varden
enter
,
they
be
leave
in
thorough
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
They
grope
their
way
into
the
ground
-
floor
room
.
 
<EOS>
here
Mr
Haredale
strike
a
light
,
and
kindle
a
pocket
taper
he
have
bring
with
him
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
,
when
the
flame
be
full
upon
him
,
that
the
locksmith
see
for
the
first
time
how
haggard
,
pale
,
and
change
he
look
;
how
worn
and
thin
he
be
;
how
perfectly
his
whole
appearance
coincide
with
all
that
he
have
say
so
strangely
as
they
ride
along
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
an
unnatural
impulse
in
Gabriel
,
after
what
he
have
hear
,
to
note
curiously
the
expression
of
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
collect
and
rational
;
---
 
so
much
<EOS>
so
,
indeed
,
that
he
feel
ashamed
of
his
momentary
suspicion
,
and
droop
his
own
when
Mr
Haredale
look
towards
him
,
as
if
he
fear
they
would
betray
his
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
walk
through
the
house
?
"
say
Mr
Haredale
,
with
a
glance
towards
the
window
,
the
crazy
shutter
of
which
be
close
and
fasten
.
 
<EOS>
"
speak
low
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
kind
of
awe
about
the
place
,
which
would
have
render
it
difficult
to
speak
in
any
other
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
whisper
"
yes
,
"
and
follow
him
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
everything
be
just
as
they
have
see
it
last
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
sense
of
closeness
from
the
exclusion
of
fresh
air
,
and
a
gloom
and
heaviness
around
,
as
though
long
imprisonment
have
make
the
very
silence
sad
.
 
<EOS>
the
homely
hanging
of
the
bed
and
window
have
begin
to
droop
;
the
dust
lie
thick
upon
their
dwindle
fold
;
and
damp
have
make
their
way
through
ceiling
,
wall
,
and
floor
.
 
<EOS>
the
board
creak
beneath
their
tread
,
as
if
resent
the
unaccustomed
intrusion
;
nimble
spider
,
paralyse
by
the
taper
's
glare
,
check
the
motion
of
their
hundred
leg
upon
the
wall
,
or
drop
like
lifeless
thing
upon
the
ground
;
the
death
-
watch
tick
;
and
the
scampering
foot
of
rat
and
mouse
rattle
behind
the
wainscot
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
look
about
them
on
the
decaying
furniture
,
it
be
strange
to
find
how
vividly
it
present
those
to
whom
it
have
belong
,
and
with
whom
it
be
once
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
seem
to
perch
again
upon
his
high
-
back
chair
;
Barnaby
to
crouch
in
his
old
favourite
corner
by
the
fire
;
the
mother
to
resume
her
usual
seat
,
and
watch
him
as
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
they
could
separate
these
object
from
the
phantom
of
the
mind
which
they
invoke
,
the
latter
only
glide
out
of
sight
,
but
linger
near
them
still
;
for
then
they
seem
to
lurk
in
closet
and
behind
the
door
,
ready
to
start
out
and
suddenly
accost
them
in
well
-
remember
tone
.
  
<EOS>
They
go
downstairs
,
and
again
into
the
room
they
have
just
now
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
unbuckle
his
sword
and
lay
it
on
the
table
,
with
a
pair
of
pocket
pistol
;
then
tell
the
locksmith
he
would
light
him
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
this
be
a
dull
place
,
sir
,
"
say
Gabriel
linger
;
"
may
no
one
share
your
watch
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
,
and
so
plainly
evince
his
wish
to
be
alone
,
that
Gabriel
could
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
moment
the
locksmith
be
stand
in
the
street
,
whence
he
could
see
that
the
light
once
more
travel
upstairs
,
and
soon
return
to
the
room
below
,
shine
brightly
through
the
chink
of
the
shutter
.
  
<EOS>
if
ever
man
be
sorely
puzzle
and
perplex
,
the
locksmith
be
,
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
even
when
snugly
seat
by
his
own
fireside
,
with
Mrs
Varden
opposite
in
a
nightcap
and
night
-
jacket
,
and
dolly
beside
him
(
in
a
most
distracting
dishabille
)
curl
her
hair
,
and
smile
as
if
she
have
never
cry
in
all
her
life
and
never
could
---
 
even
then
,
with
Toby
at
his
elbow
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
Miggs
<EOS>
(
but
that
perhaps
be
not
much
)
fall
asleep
in
the
background
<EOS>
,
he
could
not
quite
discard
his
wonder
and
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
so
in
his
dream
---
still
there
be
Mr
Haredale
,
haggard
and
careworn
,
listen
in
the
solitary
house
to
every
sound
that
stir
,
with
the
taper
shine
through
the
chink
until
the
day
should
turn
it
pale
and
end
his
lonely
watching
.

Next
morning
bring
no
satisfaction
to
the
locksmith
's
thought
,
nor
next
day
,
nor
the
next
,
nor
many
other
.
 
<EOS>
often
after
nightfall
he
enter
the
street
,
and
turn
his
eye
towards
the
well
-
know
house
;
and
as
surely
as
he
do
so
,
there
be
the
solitary
light
,
still
gleam
through
the
crevice
of
the
window
-
shutter
,
while
all
within
be
motionless
,
noiseless
,
cheerless
,
as
a
grave
.
<EOS>
unwilling
to
hazard
Mr
Haredale
's
favour
by
disobey
his
strict
injunction
,
he
never
venture
to
knock
at
the
door
or
to
make
his
presence
know
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
whenever
strong
interest
and
curiosity
attract
him
to
the
spot
---
which
be
not
seldom
---
the
light
be
always
there
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
know
what
pass
within
,
the
knowledge
would
have
yield
him
no
clue
to
this
mysterious
vigil
.
 
<EOS>
at
twilight
,
Mr
Haredale
shut
himself
up
,
and
at
daybreak
he
come
forth
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
miss
a
night
,
always
come
and
go
alone
,
and
never
vary
his
proceeding
in
the
least
degree
.
  
<EOS>
the
manner
of
his
watch
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
at
dusk
,
he
enter
the
house
in
the
same
way
as
when
the
locksmith
bear
him
company
,
kindle
a
light
,
go
through
the
room
,
and
narrowly
examine
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
he
return
to
the
chamber
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
lay
his
sword
and
pistol
on
the
table
,
sit
by
it
until
morning
.
  
<EOS>
He
usually
have
a
book
with
him
,
and
often
try
to
read
,
but
never
fix
his
eye
or
thought
upon
it
for
five
minute
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
slight
noise
without
door
,
catch
his
ear
;
a
step
upon
the
pavement
seem
to
make
his
heart
leap
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
without
some
refreshment
during
the
long
lonely
hour
;
generally
carry
in
his
pocket
a
sandwich
of
bread
and
meat
,
and
a
small
flask
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
dilute
with
large
quantity
of
water
,
he
drink
in
a
heated
,
feverish
way
,
as
though
his
throat
be
dry
;
but
he
scarcely
ever
break
his
fast
,
by
so
much
as
a
crumb
of
bread
.
  
<EOS>
if
this
voluntary
sacrifice
of
sleep
and
comfort
have
its
origin
,
as
the
locksmith
on
consideration
be
dispose
to
think
,
in
any
superstitious
expectation
of
the
fulfilment
of
a
dream
or
vision
connect
with
the
event
on
which
he
have
brood
for
so
many
year
,
and
if
he
wait
for
some
ghostly
visitor
who
walk
abroad
when
man
lie
sleep
in
their
bed
,
he
show
no
trace
of
fear
or
wavering
.
 
<EOS>
His
stern
feature
express
inflexible
resolution
;
his
brow
be
pucker
,
and
his
lip
compress
,
with
deep
and
settled
purpose
;
and
when
he
start
at
a
noise
and
listen
,
it
be
not
with
the
start
of
fear
but
hope
,
and
catch
up
his
sword
as
though
the
hour
have
come
at
last
,
he
would
clutch
it
in
his
tight
-
clench
hand
,
and
listen
with
sparkling
eye
and
eager
look
,
until
it
die
away
.
  
<EOS>
these
disappointment
be
numerous
,
for
they
ensue
on
almost
every
sound
,
but
his
constancy
be
not
shake
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
every
night
he
be
at
his
post
,
the
same
stern
,
sleepless
,
sentinel
;
and
still
night
pass
,
and
morning
dawn
,
and
he
must
watch
again
.
  
<EOS>
this
go
on
for
week
;
he
have
take
a
lodging
at
Vauxhall
in
which
to
pass
the
day
and
rest
himself
;
and
from
this
place
,
when
the
tide
serve
,
he
usually
come
to
London
Bridge
from
Westminster
by
water
,
in
order
that
he
may
avoid
the
busy
street
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
,
shortly
before
twilight
,
he
come
his
accustomed
road
upon
the
river
's
bank
,
intend
to
pass
through
Westminster
Hall
into
Palace
Yard
,
and
there
take
boat
to
London
Bridge
as
usual
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
pretty
large
concourse
of
people
assemble
round
the
Houses
of
Parliament
,
look
at
the
member
as
they
enter
and
depart
,
and
give
vent
to
rather
noisy
demonstration
of
approval
or
dislike
,
accord
to
their
know
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
make
his
way
among
the
throng
,
he
hear
once
or
twice
the
no
-
popery
cry
,
which
be
then
become
pretty
familiar
to
the
ear
of
most
man
;
but
hold
it
in
very
slight
regard
,
and
observe
that
the
idler
be
of
the
low
grade
,
he
neither
think
nor
care
about
it
,
but
make
his
way
along
,
with
perfect
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
little
knot
and
group
of
person
in
Westminster
Hall
:
some
few
look
upward
at
its
noble
ceiling
,
and
at
the
ray
of
evening
light
,
tint
by
the
set
sun
,
which
stream
in
aslant
through
its
small
window
,
and
grow
dimmer
by
degree
,
be
quench
in
the
gathering
gloom
below
;
some
,
noisy
passenger
,
mechanic
go
home
from
work
,
and
otherwise
,
who
hurry
quickly
through
,
wake
the
echo
with
their
voice
,
and
soon
darken
the
small
door
in
the
distance
,
as
they
pass
into
the
street
beyond
;
some
,
in
busy
conference
together
on
political
or
private
matter
,
pace
slowly
up
and
down
with
eye
that
seek
the
ground
,
and
seem
,
by
their
attitude
,
to
listen
earnestly
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
a
dozen
squabble
urchin
make
a
very
Babel
in
the
air
;
there
,
a
solitary
man
,
half
clerk
,
half
mendicant
,
pace
up
and
down
with
hungry
dejection
in
his
look
and
gait
;
at
his
elbow
pass
an
errand
-
lad
,
swinge
his
basket
round
and
round
,
and
with
his
shrill
whistle
rive
the
very
timber
of
the
roof
;
while
a
more
observant
schoolboy
,
half
-
way
through
,
pocket
his
ball
,
and
eye
the
distant
beadle
as
he
come
loom
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
that
time
of
evening
<EOS>
when
,
if
you
shut
your
eye
and
open
them
again
,
the
darkness
of
an
hour
appear
to
have
gather
in
a
second
.
 
<EOS>
the
smooth
-
wear
pavement
,
dusty
with
footstep
,
still
call
upon
the
lofty
wall
to
reiterate
the
shuffle
and
the
tread
of
foot
unceasingly
,
save
when
the
closing
of
some
heavy
door
resound
through
the
building
like
a
clap
of
thunder
,
and
drown
all
other
noise
in
its
rolling
sound
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
,
glance
only
at
such
of
these
group
as
he
pass
nearest
to
,
and
<EOS>
then
in
a
manner
betoken
that
his
thought
be
elsewhere
,
have
nearly
traverse
the
Hall
,
when
two
person
before
him
catch
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
,
a
gentleman
in
elegant
attire
,
carry
in
his
hand
a
cane
,
which
he
twirl
in
a
jaunty
manner
as
he
loiter
on
<EOS>
;
the
other
,
an
obsequious
,
crouch
,
fawn
figure
,
listen
to
what
he
say
---
at
time
throw
in
a
humble
word
himself
---
and
,
with
his
shoulder
shrug
up
to
his
ear
,
rub
his
hand
submissively
,
or
answer
at
interval
by
an
inclination
of
the
head
,
half
-
way
between
a
nod
of
acquiescence
,
and
a
bow
of
most
profound
respect
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
abstract
there
be
nothing
very
remarkable
in
this
pair
,
for
servility
wait
on
a
handsome
suit
of
clothe
and
a
cane
---
not
to
speak
of
gold
and
silver
stick
,
or
wand
of
office
---
be
common
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
that
about
the
well
-
dress
man
,
yes
,
and
about
the
other
likewise
,
which
strike
Mr
Haredale
with
no
pleasant
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitate
,
stop
,
and
would
have
step
aside
and
turn
out
of
his
path
,
but
at
the
moment
,
the
other
two
face
about
quickly
,
and
stumble
upon
him
before
he
could
avoid
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
with
the
cane
lift
his
hat
and
have
begin
to
tender
an
apology
,
which
Mr
Haredale
have
begin
as
hastily
to
acknowledge
and
walk
away
,
when
he
stop
short
and
cry
,
"
Haredale
!
 
<EOS>
Gad
bless
me
,
this
be
strange
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
"
he
return
impatiently
;
"
yes
---
a
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
cry
the
other
,
detain
him
,
"
why
such
great
speed
?
 
<EOS>
one
minute
,
Haredale
,
for
the
sake
of
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
haste
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
neither
of
us
have
seek
this
meeting

<EOS>
let
it
be
a
brief
one

<EOS>
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fie

"
<EOS>
reply
Sir
John
(
for
it
be
he
)
,
"
how
very
churlish
!
<EOS>
We
be
speak
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
name
be
on
my
lip
<EOS>
---
perhaps
you
hear
me
mention
it
?
 
<EOS>
no
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
really
sorry

<EOS>
---
You
know
our
friend
here
,
Haredale
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
really
a
most
remarkable
meeting
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
friend
,
plainly
very
ill
at
ease
,
have
make
bold
to
press
Sir
John
's
arm
,
and
to
give
him
other
significant
hint
that
he
be
desirous
of
avoid
this
introduction
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
do
not
suit
Sir
John
's
purpose
,
however
,
that
it
should
be
evade
,
he
appear
quite
unconscious
of
these
silent
remonstrance
,
and
incline
his
hand
towards
him
,
as
he
speak
,
to
call
attention
to
him
more
particularly
.
  
<EOS>
the
friend
,
therefore
,
have
nothing
for
it
,
but
to
muster
up
the
pleasantest
smile
he
could
,
and
to
make
a
conciliatory
bow
,
as
Mr
Haredale
turn
his
eye
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
see
that
he
be
recognise
,
he
put
out
his
hand
in
an
awkward
and
embarrassed
manner
,
which
be
not
mend
by
its
contemptuous
rejection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gashford
!
"
say
Haredale
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
I
have
hear
then
.
<EOS>
You
have
leave
the
darkness
for
the
light
,
sir
,
and
hate
those
whose
opinion
you
formerly
hold
,
with
all
the
bitterness
of
a
renegade
.
<EOS>
You
be
an
honour
,
sir
,
to
any
cause
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
one
you
espouse
at
present
,
much
joy
of
the
acquisition
it
have
make
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
secretary
rub
his
hand
and
bow
,
as
though
he
would
disarm
his
adversary
by
humble
himself
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
Chester
again
exclaim
,
with
an
air
of
great
gaiety
,
"
now
,
really
,
this
be
a
most
remarkable
meeting
!
"
and
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
his
usual
self
-
possession
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Haredale
,
"
say
Gashford
,
stealthily
raise
his
eye
,
and
let
them
drop
again
when
they
meet
the
other
's
steady
gaze
,
be
too
conscientious
,
too
honourable
,
too
manly
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
to
attach
unworthy
motive
to
an
honest
change
of
opinion
,
even
though
it
imply
a
doubt
of
those
he
hold
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
be
too
just
,
too
generous
,
too
clear
-
sighted
in
his
moral
vision
,
to

"
yes

<EOS>
"
he
rejoin
with
a
sarcastic
smile
,
find
the
secretary
stop

<EOS>
"
You
be

---
   
<EOS>
Gashford
meekly
shrug
his
shoulder
,
and
look
on
the
ground
again
,
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
but
let
us
really
,
"
interpose
Sir
John
at
this
juncture
,
"
let
us
really
,
for
a
moment
,
contemplate
the
very
remarkable
character
of
this
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Haredale
,
my
dear
friend
,
pardon
me
if
I
think
you
be
not
sufficiently
impressed
with
its
singularity
.
 
<EOS>
here
we
stand
,
by
no
previous
appointment
or
arrangement
,
three
old
schoolfellow
,
in
Westminster
Hall
;
three
old
boarder
in
a
remarkably
dull
and
shady
seminary
at
Saint
Omer
's
,
where
you
,
be
Catholics
and
of
necessity
educate
out
of
England
,
be
bring
up
;
and
where
I

be
a
promising
young
Protestant
at
that
time

be
send
to
learn
the
french
tongue
from
a
native
of
Paris
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
add
to
the
singularity
,
Sir
John
,
"
say
Mr
Haredale
,
"
that
some
of
you
<EOS>
Protestants
of
promise

at
this

yonder
building

of
privilege
of

in
this
land

where
thousand
of
us
enter
your
service
every
year

and
to
preserve
the
freedom
of
which

we
die
in
bloody
battle
abroad
,
in
heap
:
and
that
other
of
you

to
the
number
of
some
thousand
as
I
learn
,
be
lead
on
to
look
on
all
man
of
my
creed
as
wolf
and
beast
of
prey
,
by
this
man
Gashford

<EOS>
add
to
it
besides
the
bare
fact
that
this
man
live
in
society

walk
the
street
in
broad
day

I
be
about
to
say
,
hold
up
his
head

but
that

do
not

it
will
be
strange

and
very
strange

I
grant
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

you
be
hard
upon

Sir

with
an
engage
smile

You

really
very
hard

<EOS>

go

Gashford

fumble
with

I
can
make
allowance

I

your
good

"
You

retort
Mr

with
a
bitter

third
party

there

which
be
a
most
remarkable
circumstance
for
a
man
of
your
punctuality
and
exactness
,
Haredale
---
you
fall
into
error
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
belong
to
the
body
;
I
have
an
immense
respect
for
its
member

I
do
not

certainly
true

conscientious
opponent

<EOS>
I
feel
it
my
duty
to
be
so
;
it
be
a
most
unfortunate
necessity
;
and
cost
me
a
bitter
struggle

<EOS>
Will
you
try
this
box

<EOS>
if
you
do
not
object
to
a
trifling
infusion
of
a
very
chaste
scent
,
you
will
find
its
flavour
exquisite

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your

Sir

Mr

do
not

sweetly

Gashford

who

very
restless

have
not

up

now
turn
to
Sir

venture
to
mutter
something
to

must
go

be
a
lurking
look
of
triumph
,
though
very
differently
express
,
in
the
face
of
his
two
companion
,
which
make
it
a
natural
impulse
on
Mr
Haredale
's
part
not
to
give
way
before
this
leader
,
but
to
stand
there
while
he
pass
.
 
<EOS>
He
draw
himself
up
and
,
clasp
his
hand
behind
him
,
look
on
with
a
proud
and
scornful
aspect
,
while
Lord
George
slowly
advance
(
for
the
press
be
great
about
him
)
towards
the
spot
where
they
be
stand
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
leave
the
House
of
Commons
but
that
moment
,

have
come
straight
down
into
the
Hall

bring
with
him
,
as
his
custom
be
,
intelligence
of
what
have
be
say
that
night
in
reference
to
the
Papists

and
what
petition
have
be
present
in
their
favour
,
and
who
have
support
them
,
and
when
the
bill
be
to
be
bring
in
,
and
when
it
would
be
advisable
to
present
their
own
great
protestant
petition
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
he
tell
the
person
about
him
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
with
great
abundance
of
ungainly
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
be
near
him
make
comment
to
each
other
,
and
vent
threat
and
murmuring
;
those
who
be
outside
the
crowd
cry
,
"
silence
,
"
and
stand
back
,
"
or
close
in
upon
the
rest
,
endeavour
to
make
a
forcible
exchange
of
place
:
<EOS>
and
so
they
come
drive
on
in
a
very
disorderly
and
irregular
way
,
as
it
be
the
manner
of
a
crowd
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
very
near
to
where
the
secretary
,
Sir
John

and
Mr
Haredale
stand
,
Lord
George
turn
round
and
,
make
a
few
remark
of
a
sufficiently
violent
and
incoherent
kind
,
conclude
with
the
usual
sentiment
,
and
call
for
three
cheer
to
back
it
.
 
<EOS>
while
these
be
in
the
act

give
with
great
energy

he
extricate
himself
from
the

step
up
to
Gashford

side

<EOS>
both
he

Sir

well
known
to
the

back
a

this

bruise
by
his
late
fall

hurt
in
a
much
great
degree
by
the
indignity
he
have
undergo

the
exposure
of
which
he
have
be
the
victim
,
limp
up

down

breathe
curse
and
threat
of
vengeance

<EOS>
It
be
not
the
secretary
's
nature
to
waste
his
wrath
in
word

<EOS>
while
he
vent
the
froth
of
his
malevolence
in
those
effusion

he
keep
a
steady
eye
on

have
disappear
with
the
rest

spread

have
since
return

be
now
visible
in
the
moonlight

at
no
great
distance

as
they
walk
to

fro

and
talk
together

<EOS>
He
make
no
move
towards
them
,
but
wait
patiently
on
the
dark
side
of
the
street
,
until
they
be
tired
of
stroll
backwards
and
forwards
and
walk
away
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
follow
,
but
at
some
distance
:
keep
them
in
view
,
without
appear
to
have
that
object
,
or
be
see
by
them

<EOS>
They
go
up
Parliament
Street

past
Saint

away
by
Saint

Road

upon

western
side

Green
Lanes

all
heedless
walker
with
their
jagged

rusty

a
ragged
horse

to
a
stake
,
and
crop
off
a
wretched
meal
from
the
coarse
stunt
turf
,
be
quite
in
keeping
with
the

and
would
have
suggest
(
if

sufficiently

of
themselves

<EOS>
how
very
poor
the
people
be
who
live
in
the
crazy
hut
adjacent

and
how
foolhardy
it
may
prove
for
one
who
carry
money
,
or
wear
decent
clothe
,
to
walk
that
way
alone
,
unless
by

some

false

clock

of
four

in

in

in

<EOS>
these
,
in
their
several
way
of
stowage

fill
the
garden

shed
a
perfume
,
not
of
the
most
delicious
nature

in
the
air

fill
it
besides
with

<EOS>
into

He

that
of
struggle
on
from
day
to
day
in
one
great
toil
for
bread
,
---
dwelt
Barnaby
and
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Their
poor
cottage
have
know
no
stranger
's
foot
since
they
seek
the
shelter
of
its
roof
five
year
before
;
nor
have
they
in
all
that
time
hold
any
commerce
or
communication
with
the
old
world
from
which
they
have
flee
.
 
<EOS>
to
labour
in
peace
,
and
devote
her
labour
and
her
life
to
her
poor
son
,
be
all
the
widow
seek
.
 
<EOS>
if
happiness
can
be
say
at
any
time
to
be
the
lot
of
one
on
whom
a
secret
sorrow
prey
,
she
be
happy
now
.
 
<EOS>
tranquillity
,
resignation
,
and
her
strong
love
of
him
who
need
it
so
much
,
form
the
small
circle
of
her
quiet
joy
;
and
while
that
remain
unbroken
,
she
be
content
.
  
<EOS>
for
Barnaby
himself
,
the
time
which
have
fly
by
,
have
pass
him
like
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
the
daily
sun
of
year
have
shed
no
bright
gleam
of
reason
on
his
mind
;
no
dawn
have
break
on
his
long
,
dark
night
.
<EOS>
He
would
sit
sometimes
---
often
for
day
together
on
a
low
seat
by
the
fire
or
by
the
cottage
door
,
busy
at
work
(
for
he
have
learn
the
art
his
mother
ply
)
,
and
listening
,
God
help
him
,
to
the
tale
she
would
repeat
,
as
a
lure
to
keep
him
in
her
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
recollection
of
these
little
narrative
;
the
tale
of
yesterday
be
new
to
him
upon
the
morrow
;
but
he
like
them
at
the
moment
;
and
when
the
humour
hold
him
,
would
remain
patiently
within
door
,
hear
her
story
like
a
little
child
,
and
work
cheerfully
from
sunrise
until
it
be
too
dark
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
---
and
then
their
scanty
earning
be
barely
sufficient
to
furnish
them
with
food
,
though
of
the
coarse
sort
,
---
 
he
would
wander
abroad
from
dawn
of
day
until
the
twilight
deepen
into
night
.
 
<EOS>
few
in
that
place
,
even
of
the
child
,
could
be
idle
,
and
he
have
no
companion
of
his
own
kind
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
not
many
who
could
have
keep
up
with
him
in
his
ramble
,
<EOS>
have
there
be
a
legion
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
score
of
vagabond
dog
belong
to
the
neighbour
,
who
serve
his
purpose
quite
as
well
.
<EOS>
with
two
or
three
of
these
,
or
sometimes
with
a
full
half
-
dozen
barking
at
his
heel
,
he
would
sally
forth
on
some
long
expedition
that
consume
the
day
;
and
though
,
on
their
return
at
nightfall
,
the
dog
would
come
home
limping
and
sore
-
footed
,
and
almost
spend
with
their
fatigue
,
Barnaby
be
up
and
off
again
at
sunrise
with
some
new
attendant
of
the
same
class
,
with
whom
he
would
return
in
like
manner
.
 
<EOS>
on
all
these
travel
,
Grip
,
in
his
little
basket
at
his
master
's
back
,
be
a
constant
member
of
the
party
,
and
when
they
set
off
in
fine
weather
and
in
high
spirit
,
no
dog
bark
louder
than
the
raven
.
  
<EOS>
Their
pleasure
on
these
excursion
be
simple
enough
.
 
<EOS>
a
crust
of
bread
and
scrap
of
meat
,
with
water
from
the
brook
or
spring
,
suffice
for
their
repast
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
's
enjoyment
be
,
to
walk
,
and
run
,
and
leap
,
till
he
be
tired
;
then
to
lie
down
in
the
long
grass
,
or
by
the
grow
corn
,
or
in
the
shade
of
some
tall
tree
,
look
upward
at
the
light
cloud
as
they
float
over
the
blue
surface
of
the
sky
,
and
listen
to
the
lark
as
she
pour
out
her
brilliant
song
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
wild
-
flower
to
pluck
---
the
bright
red
poppy
,
the
gentle
harebell
,
the
cowslip
,
and
the
rose
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
bird
to
watch
;
fish
;
ant
;
worm
;
hare
or
rabbit
,
as
they
dart
across
the
distant
pathway
in
the
wood
and
so
be
go
:
<EOS>
million
of
live
thing
to
have
an
interest
in
,
and
lie
in
wait
for
,
and
clap
hand
and
shout
in
memory
of
,
when
they
have
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
in
default
of
these
,
or
when
they
weary
,
there
be
the
merry
sunlight
to
hunt
out
,
as
it
creep
in
aslant
through
leave
and
bough
of
tree
,
and
hide
far
down
---
deep
,
deep
,
in
hollow
place
---
 
like
a
silver
pool
,
where
nod
branch
seem
to
bathe
and
sport
;
sweet
scent
of
summer
air
breathing
over
field
of
bean
or
clover
;
the
perfume
of
wet
leave
or
mos
;
the
life
of
wave
tree
,
and
shadow
always
change
.
 
<EOS>
when
these
or
any
of
them
tired
,
or
in
excess
of
please
tempt
him
to
shut
his
eye
,
there
be
slumber
in
the
midst
of
all
these
soft
delight
,
with
the
gentle
wind
murmur
like
music
in
his
ear
,
and
everything
around
melt
into
one
delicious
dream
.
  
<EOS>
Their
hut
---
for
it
be
little
more
---
stand
on
the
outskirt
of
the
town
,
at
a
short
distance
from
the
high
road
,
but
in
a
secluded
place
,
where
few
chance
passenger
stray
at
any
season
of
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
a
plot
of
garden
-
ground
attach
,
which
Barnaby
,
in
fit
and
start
of
working
,
trim
,
and
keep
in
order
.
 
<EOS>
within
door
and
without
,
his
mother
labour
for
their
common
good
;
and
hail
,
rain
,
snow
,
or
sunshine
,
find
no
difference
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
though
so
far
remove
from
the
scene
of
her
past
life
,
and
with
so
little
thought
or
hope
of
ever
visit
them
again
,
she
seem
to
have
a
strange
desire
to
know
what
happen
in
the
busy
world
.
 
<EOS>
any
old
newspaper
,
or
scrap
of
intelligence
from
London
,
she
catch
at
with
avidity
.
 
<EOS>
the
excitement
it
produce
be
not
of
a
pleasurable
kind
,
for
her
manner
at
such
time
express
the
keen
anxiety
and
dread
;
but
it
never
fade
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
and
in
stormy
winter
night
,
when
the
wind
blow
loud
and
strong
,
the
old
expression
come
into
her
face
,
and
she
would
be
seize
with
a
fit
of
tremble
,
like
one
who
have
an
ague
.
 
<EOS>
but
Barnaby
note
little
of
this
;
and
put
a
great
constraint
upon
herself
,
she
usually
recover
her
accustomed
manner
before
the
change
have
catch
his
observation
.
  
<EOS>
grip
be
by
no
means
an
idle
or
unprofitable
member
of
the
humble
household
.
 
<EOS>
partly
by
dint
of
Barnaby
's
tuition
,
and
partly
by
pursue
a
species
of
self
-
instruction
common
to
his
tribe
,
and
exert
his
power
of
observation
to
the
utmost
,
he
have
acquire
a
degree
of
sagacity
which
render
him
famous
for
mile
round
.
 
<EOS>
His
conversational
power
and
surprising
performance
be
the
universal
theme
:
and
as
many
person
come
to
see
the
wonderful
raven
,
and
none
leave
his
exertion
unrewarde
---
when
he
condescend
to
exhibit
,
which
be
not
always
,
for
genius
be
capricious
---
his
earning
form
an
important
item
in
the
common
stock
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
bird
himself
appear
to
know
his
value
well
;
for
though
he
be
perfectly
free
and
unrestrained
in
the
presence
of
Barnaby
and
his
mother
,
he
maintain
in
public
an
amazing
gravity
,
and
never
stoop
to
any
other
gratuitous
performance
than
bite
the
ankle
of
vagabond
boy
(
an
exercise
in
which
he
much
delighted
)
,
kill
a
fowl
or
two
occasionally
,
and
swallow
the
dinner
of
various
neighbouring
dog
,
of
whom
the
boldest
hold
him
in
great
awe
and
dread
.
  
<EOS>
Time
have
glide
on
in
this
way
,
and
nothing
have
happen
to
disturb
or
change
their
mode
of
life
,
when
,
one
summer
's
night
in
June
,
they
be
in
their
little
garden

rest
from
the
labours
of
the

the

upon

Barnaby
stand
lean
on
his
spade

gaze
at
the
brightness
in
the
west

and
singe
softly
to
himself
.

"

the

wickedness

I
may
say
,
out

he
have
that
regard

you

I
believe
even
if
you
disappoint
him
now

he
would
consent

take
charge

your

make
a

with
these
word
he
grope
his
way
to
the
door

carry
his
chair
with
him

then
seat
himself
,
under
a
spread
honeysuckle
,
and
stretch
his
leg
across
the
threshold
so
that
no

could
pass
in

out
without

he
take
from
his

a
pipe
,
flint

steel

tinder

box

and
begin
to
smoke

<EOS>
It
be
a
lovely
evening

of

gentle
kind
,
and
at
that
time
of
year
,
when
the
twilight
be
most
beautiful

<EOS>
pause
now
and
then
to
let
his
smoke
curl
slowly
off
,
and
to
sniff
the
grateful
fragrance
of
the
flower
,
he
sit
there
at
his
ease
---
as
though
the
cottage
be
his
proper
dwelling
,
and
he
have
hold
undisputed
possession
of
it
all
his

for

up
the
loaf
in

a
scarce
and
precious
article

it
carelessly
on

Barnaby
,
draw
his

nearer
to

eagerly
in

turn
his
face
,
on
which
there
be
a
smile
of
triumph
,
to
where
the
widow

in
great
distress

I
be
often
out
before

home
when

have
go
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
away
in
the
wood
before
the
day
have
reach
the
shady
place
,
and
be
often
there
when
the
bright
moon
be
peep
through
the
bough
,
and
look
down
upon
the
other
moon
that
live
in

as
I
walk
along
,
I
try
to
find

that
small
money
for
which

work
so
hard

use
to
shed
so
many
tear

<EOS>
as
I
lie
asleep
in
the
shade
,
I
dream
of
it

<EOS>
dream
of
dig
it
up
in
heap
;
and
spy
it
out
,
hide
under
bush
;
and
see
it
sparkle
,
as

drop

I
would
go
there

journey
be
a

would
be
happy
when
I
come
home

bring
some
with

we
must
have

we
must
be
buy
off

<EOS>
keep
to
that
point

let
me
return
to
my

in

he
be
wild
with
delight
;
in
another
,
full
of
grief
at
the
prospect
of
part
with
his
friend

in

wild

then
he
be
fearful
of
what

have
say
to
prevent
his
wander
abroad
that
night

and
full
of
terror
and
strange
question

<EOS>
His
light
-
heartedness
in
the
end
surmount
all
his
other
feeling

and
lie
down
in
his
clothe
to
the
end
that
he
may
be
ready
on
the
morrow
,
he
soon
fall
fast
asleep
before
the
poor

His

do
not
close
her

sit
beside
him

watch

<EOS>
every
breath
of

sound
in
her
ear
like
that
dread
footstep
at
the

or
like
that
hand
upon
the
latch

and
make
the
calm
summer
night

a
night
of
horror

<EOS>
at

the
welcome

<EOS>
when
she
have
make
the
little
preparation
which

needful

have

upon

His

to
carry
Grip
be
a
labour
of

as
the
sun
shed
his
early
beam
upon
the
earth
,
they
close
the
door
of
their
desert
home

the

the

fresh

Barnaby
look
upward
,
and

with
all
his

<EOS>
but
it
be
a
day
he
usually
devote
to
a
long
ramble
,
and
one
of
the
dog
---
the
ugly
of
them
all
---
come
bound
up
,
and
jump
round
him
in
the
fulness
of
his
joy

He
have
to
bid
him
go
back
in
a
surly

his
heart
smite
him
while

do
so

turn
with
a
half

incredulous
,
half

imploring
look

come
a
little
back
;
and
stop
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
appeal
of
an
old
companion
and
a
faithful
friend

cast
off

<EOS>
Barnaby
could
bear
no
more
,
and
as
he
shake
his
head
and
wave
his
playmate
home
,
he
burst
into
tear
.

"
oh

how
mournful

<EOS>
there
be
such
a

He

when

halt
at
an
alehouse
some
mile
further
on

and
hear
the
justice

character
as
give
by

that
perhaps
something

require
to
form
either
a

"

be

Heaven

check
herself
,
and
tell
him
no

she
think
not

why
do

ask
?
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
wise
man

"

Barnaby

with
a
thoughtful
countenance

I
wish
that

again

what
be
it
that

<EOS>
that
gold
be

find
where
people
crowd

not
among

in

quiet

He
speak
as

it

London
be

crowded
place

I
think
we
shall
meet
him
there

why
do
you
desire

see
him

love

she
ask

<EOS>
"
because
,
"
say
Barnaby
,
look
wistfully
at
her
,
"
he
talk
to
me
about
gold
,
which
be
a
rare
thing
,

say
what
you
will

a
thing
you
would
like
to
have
,
I
know

<EOS>
and
because
he
come
and
go
away
so
strangely
---
just
as
white
-
head
old
man
come
sometimes
to
my
bed
's
foot
in
the
night
,
and
say
what
I
can
not
remember
when
the
bright
day
return
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
would
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
he
break
his
word
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
never
think
of
be
rich
or
gay
,
before
,
dear
Barnaby
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
be
content
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
and
bade
her
<EOS>
say
that
again
,
then
cry
,
"
<EOS>
ay
ay
---
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
"
and
laugh
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
then
something
pass
that
catch
his
fancy
,
and
the
topic
wander
from
his
mind
,
and
be
succeed
by
another
just
as
fleeting
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
plain
from
what
he
have
say
,
and
from
his
return
to
the
point
more
than
once
that
day
,
and
on
the
next
,
that
the
blind
man
's
visit
,
and
indeed
his
word
,
have
take
strong
possession
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
idea
of
wealth
have
occur
to
him
for
the
first
time
on
look
at
the
golden
cloud
that
evening
---
and
image
be
often
present
to
his
thought
by
outward
object
quite
as
remote
and
distant
;
or
whether
their
poor
and
humble
way
of
life
have
suggest
it
,
by
contrast
,
long
ago
;
or
whether
the
accident
(
as
he
would
deem
it
)
of
the
blind
man
's
pursue
the
current
of
his
own
remark
,
have
do
so
at
the
moment
;
or
he
have
be
impress
by
the
mere
circumstance
of
the
man
be
blind
,
and
,
therefore
,
unlike
any
one
with
whom
he
have
talk
before
;
it
be
impossible
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
She
try
every
means
to
discover
,
but
in
vain
;
and
the
probability
be
that
Barnaby
himself
be
equally
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
It
fill
her
with
uneasiness
to
find
him
harp
on
this
string
,
but
all
that
she
could
do
,
be
to
lead
him
quickly
to
some
other
subject
,
and
to
dismiss
it
from
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
to
caution
him
against
their
visitor
,
to
show
any
fear
or
suspicion
in
reference
to
him
,
would
only
be
,
she
fear
,
to
increase
that
interest
with
which
Barnaby
regard
him
,
and
to
strengthen
his
desire
to
meet
him
once
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
hope
,
by
plunge
into
the
crowd
,
to
rid
herself
of
her
terrible
pursuer
,
and
then
,
by
journey
to
a
distance
and
observe
increase
caution
,
if
that
be
possible
,
to
live
again
unknown
,
in
secrecy
and
peace
.
  
<EOS>
They
reach
,
in
course
of
time
,
their
halting
-
place
within
ten
mile
of
London
,
and
lie
there
for
the
night
,
after
bargaining
to
be
carry
on
for
a
trifle
next
day

in
a
light
van

five
o'clock
in

punctual

good

hot

at
seven

of

the

one
thousand

farewell

stand
alone

together

on

Chapter
48
    
Uncertain
where
to
go
next
,
and
bewilder
by
the
crowd
of
people
who
be
already
astir
,
they
sit
down
in
one
of
the
recess
on
the
bridge
,
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
They
soon
become
aware
that
the
stream
of
life
be
all
pour
one
way
,
and
that
a
vast
throng
of
person
be
cross
the
river
from
the
Middlesex
to
the
Surrey
shore
,
in
unusual
haste
and
evident
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
knot
of
two
or
three
,
or
sometimes
half
-
a
-
dozen
;
they
speak
little
together
---
many
of
them
be
quite
silent
;
and
hurry
on
as
if
they
have
one
absorb
object
in
view
,
which
be
common
to
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
surprised
to
see
that
nearly
every
man
in
this
great
concourse
,
which
still
come
pour
past
,
without
slacken
in
the
least
,
wear
in
his
hat
a
blue
cockade
;
and
that
the
chance
passenger
who
be
not
so
decorate
,
appear
timidly
anxious
to
escape
observation
or
attack
,
and
give
them
the
wall
as
if
they
would
conciliate
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
natural
enough
,
consider
their
inferiority
in
point
of
number
;
for
the
proportion
of
those
who
wear
blue
cockade
,
to
those
who
be
dress
as
usual
,
be
at
least
forty
or
fifty
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
quarrelling
,
however
:
the
blue
cockade
go
swarm
on
,
pass
each
other
when
they
could
,
and
make
all
the
speed
that
be
possible
in
such
a
multitude
;
and
exchange
nothing
more
than
look
,
and
very
often
not
even
those
,
with
such
of
the
passer
-
by
as
be
not
of
their
number
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
the
current
of
people
have
be
confine
to
the
two
pathway
,
and
but
a
few
more
eager
straggler
keep
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
but
after
half
an
hour
or
so
,
the
passage
be
completely
block
up
by
the
great
press
,
which
,
be
now
closely
wedge
together
,
and
impede
by
the
cart
and
coach
it
encounter
,
move
but
slowly
,
and
be
sometimes
at
a
stand
for
five
or
ten
minute
together
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
two
hour
,
the
number
begin
to
diminish
visibly
,
and
gradually
dwindle
away
,
by
little
and
little
,
leave
the
bridge
quite
clear
,
save
that
,
now
and
then
,
some
hot
and
dusty
man
,
with
the
cockade
in
his
hat
,
and
his
coat
throw
over
his
shoulder
,
go
pant
by
,
fearful
of
be
too
late
,
or
stop
to
ask
which
way
his
friend
have
take
,
and
be
direct
,
hasten
on
again
like
one
refresh
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
comparative
solitude
,
which
seem
quite
strange
and
novel
after
the
late
crowd
,
the
widow
have
for
the
first
time
an
opportunity
of
inquire
of
an
old
man
who
come
and
sit
beside
them

what
be
the

that
great
assemblage

quickly
through
the
Bridge
Road
,
where
the
shop

all
shut
up

in

down
into
the
street

with
face
variously
expressive

of
interest

expectancy

indignation

some
of
these
applaud

some
hissed

regardless
of
these
interruption

for
the
noise
of

vast
congregation
of
people
at
a
little
distance

roaring

his
pace

before
St

field

<EOS>
They
be
really

that
time

and
of
considerable
extent

here
an
immense
multitude
be
collect
,
bear
flag
of
various
kind
and
size
,
but
all
of
the
same
colour
---
blue
,
like
the
cockade
---
some
section
march
to
and
fro
in
military
array
,
and
other
draw
up
in
circle
,
square
,
and
line

<EOS>
a
large
portion

both
of
the
body

the
ground

in
singe
hymn

psalm

<EOS>
with
whomsoever

it
be
well

for
the
sound
of
so
many
thousand
voice
in
the
air
must
have
stir
the
heart
of
any

a
wonderful
effect
upon
enthusiast

however
mistaken

<EOS>
scout
have
be
post
in

of
the
great
body

these

quickly
pass
through
the
whole
host
,
and
for
a
short
interval
there
ensue
a
profound
and
deathlike
silence
,
during
which
the
mass
be
so
still
and
quiet
,
that
the
fluttering
of
a
banner
catch
the
eye
,
and
become
a
circumstance
of
note
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
burst
into
a
tremendous
shout
,
into
another
,
and
another
;
and
the
air
seem
rent
and
shake
,
as
if
by
the
discharge
of
cannon

<EOS>
"
Gashford

cry
Lord
George
,
press
his
secretary

arm
tight
within
his

with
as
much
emotion
in
his
voice
,
as
in
his
altered
face
,
<EOS>
"
I

call
indeed

I
feel
and
know
it

<EOS>
I

the
leader

a
host

<EOS>
if
they
summon
me
at
this
moment
with
one
voice
to
lead
them
on
to
death

I
would
do
it

<EOS>
yes

fall
first
myself

"
It
be
a

a
noble
day
for
England

devoted

his
master

catch
him
by
both
hand
;

he
have
make
a
show
of
kneel
at
his
foot

<EOS>
"
do
not
unfit
me
,
dear
Gashford
,
for
the
solemn
duty
of
this
glorious
day

"
the
tear
stand
in
the
eye
of
the
poor
gentleman
as
he
say
the
word
.
<EOS>
---
"
let
us
go
among
them
;
we
have
to
find
a
place
in
some
division
for
this
new
recruit

give
me
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gashford
slide
his
cold
insidious
palm
into
his
master
's
grasp
,
and
so
,
hand
in
hand
,
and
follow
still
by
Barnaby
and
by
his
mother
too
,
they
mingle
with
the
concourse
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
by
this
time
take
to
their
singing
again
,
and
as
their
leader
pass
between
their
rank
,
they
raise
their
voice
to
their
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
those
who
be
band
together
to
support
the
religion
of
their
country
,
even
unto
death
,
have
never
hear
a
hymn
or
psalm
in
all
their
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
fellow
have
for
the
most
part
strong
lung
,
and
be
naturally
fond
of
singe
,
chant
any
ribaldry
or
nonsense
that
occur
to
them
,
feel
pretty
certain
that
it
would
not
be
detect
in
the
general
chorus
,
and
not
care
much
if
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
these
voluntary
be
sing
under
the
very
nose
of
Lord
George
Gordon
,
who
,
quite
unconscious
of
their
burden
,
pass
on
with
his
usual
stiff
and
solemn
deportment
,
very
much
edify
and
delight
by
the
pious
conduct
of
his
follower

<EOS>
so
they
go

Their

It

<EOS>
through
this
vast
throng

sprinkle
doubtless

with
honest

but
compose
for
the

part
of
the
very
scum
and
refuse
of
London
,
whose
growth
be
foster
by
bad
criminal

bad

such

<EOS>
one

the

every

<EOS>
the

fill
with
execration

<EOS>
the

while
the

,
both
within

be
so
great
,
that
those
who
attempt

could
scarcely
hear
their

:
far
less
,
consult
upon
the
course
it
would
be
wise
to
take
in
such
extremity
,
or
animate
each
other
to
dignified
and
firm
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
so
sure
as

and
cautiously
open
by
those
within
for
his
admission
,
give
them
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
interior
,
they
grow
more
wild
and
savage
,
like
beast
at
the
sight
of
prey
,
and
make
a
rush
against
the
portal
which
strain
its
lock

with
his
elbow
on
the
bannister

and
his

<EOS>
whenever

attitude
in
the
slight

so
much

certain
to
increase
,
not
merely
there

"

voice
which
make
itself

even
above
the
roar
and
tumult
,
as
Lord

appear
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
"
News

<EOS>
the
noise

,
until
Gashford

round
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
silence
immediately
---
even
among
the
people
in
the
passage
without
,
and
on
the
other
staircase
,
who

neither

notwithstanding

<EOS>
"
Gentlemen

and
agitated

<EOS>
They

"
We

echo
the
crowd

<EOS>
and
so
among
their
shout
and
cheer
and
other
cry
,
he
bow
to
them
and
retire
,
and
presently
come
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
gesture
from
Gashford
,
and
a
dead
silence
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
"
he
say
,
this
time
,
"
that
we
have
little
reason
,
gentleman
,
to
hope
for
any
redress
from

proceeding
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
must
redress
our

grievance
<EOS>
,
we
must
meet
again
,
we
must
put
our
trust
in
Providence
,
and
it

little
more
temperate
than

<EOS>
when
the
noise
and
exasperation
be
at
their
height
,
he
come
back
once
more
,
and
tell
them
that
the
alarm

mile
round

that
when
the
King

together
in
that
great
body
,
he
have
no
doubt
,
His
Majesty
would
send
down
private
order
to
have
their
wish
comply
with
;
and
---
with
the
manner
of
his
speech
as
childish
,
irresolute
,
and
uncertain
as
his
matter
---
be
proceed
in
this
strain
,
when
two
gentleman
suddenly
appear
at
the
door
where
he
stand
,
and
press
past
him
and
come
a
step
or
two
low
down
upon
the

confront
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
the
boldness
of
this
action
quite
take
them
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not

<EOS>
when
one
of
the
gentleman
,
turn
to
Lord
George
,
speak
thus
---
in
a
loud
voice
that
they
may
hear
him
well
,
but
quite
coolly
and
collectedly
:
  
"
You
may
tell
these
people
,
if
you
please
,
my
lord
,
that
I
be
General
Conway
of

and
that
I
oppose

<EOS>
I
be
a
soldier
,
you
may
tell
them
,
and
I
will
protect
the
freedom
of
this
place
with
my
sword
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
my
lord
,
that
the
member
of
this
House
be
all
in
arm
to
-
day
;
you
know
that
the
entrance
to

a
narrow
one

you
can
not
be
ignorant
that
there
be
man
within
these
wall
who
be
determined
to
defend
that

to
the

I
swear
to
run
my
sword
that
moment

"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
they
step
back
again
,
keep
their
face
towards
the
crowd
;
take
each
an
arm
of
the
misguided
nobleman
;
draw
him
into
the
passage
,
and
shut
the
door
;
which
they
directly
lock
and
fasten
on
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
quickly
do
,
and
the
demeanour
of
both
gentleman

who
be
not
young
man
either
---
be
so
gallant
and
resolute
,
that
the
crowd
falter
and
stare
at
each
other
with
irresolute
and
timid
look
.
 
<EOS>
many
try
to
turn
towards
the
door
;
some
of
the
faintest
-
hearted
cry
they
have
best
go
back
,
and
call
to
those
behind
to
give
way
;
and
the
panic
and
confusion
be
increase
rapidly
,
when
Gashford
whisper
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
now
!
"
<EOS>
Hugh
roar
aloud
,
turn
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
go
back
?
<EOS>
where
can
you
do
better
than
here
,
boy
!
 
<EOS>
one
good
rush
against
these
door
and
one
below
at
the
same
time

will
do
the
business
.
<EOS>
rush
on
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
door
below

let
those
stand
back
who
be
afraid

<EOS>
let
those
who

to

it

here

<EOS>
look
out
down
there

"
  
<EOS>
without
the
delay
of
an
instant
,
he
throw
himself
headlong
over
the
bannister
into
the
lobby
below
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
touch
the
ground
when
Barnaby
be
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
chaplain
's
assistant
,
and
some
member
who
be
implore
the
people
to
retire
,
immediately
withdraw
;
and
then
,
with
a
great
shout
,
both
crowd
throw
themselves
against
the
door
pell
-
mell
,
and
besiege
the
House
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
,
when
a
second
onset
must
have
bring
them
into
collision
with
those
who
stand
on
the
defensive
within
,
in
which
case
great
loss
of
life
and
bloodshed
would
inevitably
have
ensue
,
---
the
hindmost
portion
of
the
crowd
give
way
,
and
the
rumour
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
a
messenger
have
be
despatch
by
water
for
the
military
,
who
be
form
in
the
street

<EOS>
Fearful
of
sustain
a
charge
in
the
narrow
passage
in
which
they
be
so
closely
wedge
together
,
the
throng
pour
out
as
impetuously
as
they
have
flock
in
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
whole
stream
turn
at
once
,
Barnaby
and
Hugh
go
with
it
:
and
<EOS>
so
,
fight
and
struggle
and
trample
on
fall
man
and
be
trample
on
in
turn
themselves
,
they
and
the
whole
mass
float
by
degree
into
the
open
street
,
where
a
large
detachment
of
the
Guards
,
both
horse
and
foot
,
come
hurry
up
;
clear
the
ground
before
them
so
rapidly
that
the
people
seem
to
melt
away
as
they
advance
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
of
command
to
halt
be
give
,
the
soldier
form
across
the
street
;
the
rioter
,
breathless
and
exhausted
with
their
late
exertion
,
form
likewise
,
though
in
a
very
irregular
and
disorderly
manner
.
 
<EOS>
the
command
officer
ride
hastily
into
the
open
space
between
the
two
body
,
accompany
by
a
magistrate
and
an
officer
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
for
whose
accommodation
a
couple
of
trooper
have
hastily
dismount
.
 
<EOS>
the
Riot
Act
be
read
,
but
not

<EOS>
in
the
first
rank
of

<EOS>
somebody
have
thrust
into
Barnaby
's
hand
when
he
come
out
into
the
street
,
his
precious
flag
;
which
,
be
now

up
and
tie
round
the
pole
,
look
like
a
giant
quarter
-
staff
as
he
grasp
it
firmly
and
stand
upon
his
guard
.
 
<EOS>
if
ever
man

with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
that
he
be
engage
in
a
just
cause
,
and
that
he

by
his
leader
to
the
last

poor
Barnaby
believe
it
of
himself
and
Lord
George
Gordon
.
  
<EOS>
after
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
make
himself
hear
,
the
magistrate
give
the
word
and
the
Horse
Guards
come
ride
in
among
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
but
,
even
then

gallop
here
and
there

to
disperse
;
and
,
although
heavy
stone
be

at
the
man
,
and
some
be
desperately
cut
and
bruise
,
they
have
no
order
but
to
make
prisoner

such
of
the
rioter
as
be
the
most
active
,
and
to
drive
the
people
back
with
the
flat
of
their
sabre
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
horse
come
in
among
them
,
the
throng
give
way
at
many
point
,
and
the
Guards
,
follow
up
their
advantage
,
be
rapidly
clear
the
ground
,
when
two
or
three
of
the
foremost
,
who
be
in
a
manner
cut
off
from
the
rest
by
the
people
close
round
them
,
make
straight
towards
Barnaby
and
Hugh
,
who
have
no
doubt
be
point
out
as
the
two
man
who
drop
into
the
lobby
:
lay
about
them
now
with
some
effect
,
and
inflict
on
the
more
turbulent
of
their
opponent
,
a
few
slight
flesh
wound
,
under
the
influence
of
which
a
man
drop
,
here
and
there
,
into
the
arm
of
his
fellow
,
amid
much
groaning
and
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
sight
of
gash
and
bloody
face
,
see
for
a
moment
in
the
crowd
,
then
hide
by
the
press
around
them
,
Barnaby
turn
pale
and
sick
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
stand
his
ground
,
and
grasp
his
pole
more
firmly
yet
,
keep
his
eye
fix
upon
the
near
soldier
---
nod
his
head
meanwhile
,
as
Hugh
,
with
a
scowling
visage
,
whisper
in
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
the
soldier
come
spur
on
,
make
his
horse
rear
as
the
people
press
about
him
,
cut
at
the
hand
of
those
who
would
have
grasp
his
rein
and
force
his
charger
back
,
and
wave
to
his
comrade
to
follow
---
and
still
Barnaby
,
without
retreat
an
inch
,
wait
for
his
coming
.
 
<EOS>
some
call
to
him
to
fly
,
and
some
be
in
the
very
act
of
closing
round
him
,
to
prevent
his
be
take
,
when
the
pole
sweep
into
the
air
above
the
people
's
head
,
and
the
man
's
saddle
be
empty
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
he
and
Hugh
turn
and
flee
,
the
crowd
opening
to
let
them
pass
,
and
close
up
again
so
quickly
that
there
be
no
clue
to
the
course
they
have
take
.
 
<EOS>
pant
for
breath
,
hot
,
dusty
,
and
exhaust
with
fatigue
,
they
reach
the
riverside
in
safety
,
and
get
into
a
boat
with
all
despatch
be
soon
out
of
any
immediate
danger
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
glide
down
the
river
,
they
plainly
hear
the
people
cheer
;
and
supposing
they
may
have
force
the
soldier
to
retreat
,
lie
upon
their
oar
for
a
few
minute
,
uncertain
whether
to
return
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
crowd
pass
along
Westminster
Bridge
,
soon
assure
them
that
the
populace
be
disperse
;
and
Hugh
rightly
guess
from
this
,
that
they
have
cheer
the
magistrate
for
offer
to
dismiss
the
military
on
condition
of
their
immediate
departure
to
their
several
home
,
and
that
he
and
Barnaby
be
well
where
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
advise
,
therefore
,
that
they
should
proceed
to
Blackfriars
,
and
,
go
ashore
at
the
bridge
,
make
the
good
of
their
way
to
the
Boot
;
where
there
be
not
only
good
entertainment
and
safe
lodging
,
but
where
they
would
certainly
be
join
by
many
of
their
late
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
assenting
<EOS>
,
they
decide
on
this
course
of
action
,
and
pull
for
Blackfriars
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
They
land
at
a
critical
time
,
and
fortunately
for
themselves
at
the
right
moment
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
come
into
Fleet
Street
,
they
find
it
in
an
unusual
stir
;
and
inquire
the
cause
,
be
tell
that
a
body
of
Horse
Guards
have
just
gallop
past
,
and
that
they
be
escort
some
rioter
whom
they
have
make
prisoner
,
to
Newgate
for
safety
.
<EOS>
not
at
all
ill
-
pleased
to
have
so
narrowly
escape
the
cavalcade
<EOS>
,
they
lose
no
more
time
in
ask
question
,
but
hurry
to
the
Boot
with
as
much
speed
as
Hugh
consider
it
prudent
to
make
,
without
appear
singular
or
attract
an
inconvenient
share
of
public
notice

begin
to
busy
himself
in
rip
off
the

have
wear
all

at

time
hum
a

tune

have
be
very
popular

dwell
on
it

They

<EOS>
some
report
that
the
riot
be
effectually
put
down

other
that

out
again

some
say
that
Lord

strong
guard
to
the
Tower

other
that
an
attempt

noise
of
musketry
in

distant
part

plainly
hear
within
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
grow
dark
,
these
story
become
more
direful

mysterious
;
and
often
,
when
some
frightened
passenger
run
past
with
tiding
that
the
rioter
be
not
far
off

and
be
come
up

the

Gashford
walk
stealthily
about

all

diffusing

confirming
,
whenever
he
have
an
opportunity

such
false
intelligence

suited
his

purpose
;
and
,
busily
occupy
in
this
way
,
turn
into
Holborn
for
the
twentieth
time
,
when
a
great
many
woman

child
come
fly
along
the
street

often
pant
and
look
back
---
and
the
confused
murmur
of
numerous
voice
strike
upon
his
ear

<EOS>
assure
by
these
token
,
and
by
the
red
light
which
begin
to
flash
upon
the
house
on
either
side

that
some

open

run
with
some

to
an
upper
window
,
look
out
upon
the
crowd

They
have
torch
among

distinctly
visible

<EOS>
that

apparent

that

evident
from
the
spoil
they

trophy

easily
recognisable
for

rich
fragment
of
altar
furniture

cover

soot

their

their
hair
hang
wildly
about
them
;
their
hand
and
face
jagged
and
bleed
with
the
wound
of
rusty
nail
;
Barnaby
,
Hugh
,
and
Dennis
hurry
on
before
them
all
,
like
hideous
madman
.
 
<EOS>
after
them
,
the
dense
throng
come
fighting
on
:
some
singing
;
<EOS>
some
shouting
in
triumph
;
some
quarrel
among
themselves
;
some
menace
the
spectator
as
they
pass
;
some
with
great
wooden
fragment
,
on
which
they
spend
their
rage
as
if
they
have
be
alive
,
rend
them
limb
from
limb
,
and
hurl
the
scatter
morsel
high
into
the
air

some
in
a
drunken
state
,
unconscious
of
the
hurt
they
have
receive
from
fall
brick

stone

and

one
borne
upon

in
the
very
midst

cover
with
a
dingy
cloth
,
a
senseless
,
ghastly
heap

thus
---
a
vision
of
coarse
face
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
blot
of
flaring
,
smoky
light
;
a
dream
of
demon
head
and
savage
eye
,
and
stick
and
iron
bar
uplift
in
the
air
,
and
whirl
about

a

horror

in

the

she
would
be

upright

all

come
upright

rigid
again
with

open

in

an
expression
of
defiance

sleepy

Simon
make
no
answer
,
but
gather
himself
up
as
straight
as
he
could
,
plunge
head
foremost
at
his
old
master
,
and
the
two
go
drive
out
into
the
workshop
together
,
ply
their
hand
and
foot
so
briskly
that
they
look
like
half
-
a
-
dozen
,
while
Miggs

Mrs
Varden
scream
for
twelve

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
for
Varden
to
knock
his
old
'
prentice
down
,
and
bind
him
hand
and
foot
;
but
as
he
be
loth
to
hurt
him
in
his
then
defenceless
state

he
content
himself
with
parry
his
blow
when
he
could
,
take
them
in
perfect
good
part
when
he
could
not
,
and
keep
between
him
and
the
door
,
until
a
favourable
opportunity
should
present
itself
for
force
him
to
retreat
up
-
stair
,
and
shut
him
up
in
his
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
,
he
calculate
too
much
upon
his
adversary
's
weakness
,
and
forget
that
drunken
man
who
have
lose
the
power
of
walk
steadily
,
can
often
run
.
 
<EOS>
watch
his
time
,
Simon
Tappertit
make
a
cunning
show
of
fall
back
,
stagger
unexpectedly
forward
,
brush
past
him
,
open
the
door
(
he
know
the
trick
of
that
lock
well
)
,
and
dart
down
the
street
like
a
mad
dog
.
 
<EOS>
the
locksmith
pause
for
a
moment
in
the
excess
of
his
astonishment
,
and
then
give
chase
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
excellent
season
for
a
run
,
for
at
that
silent
hour
the
street
be
desert

the
air
be
cool
,
and
the
flying
figure
before
him
distinctly
visible
at
a
great
distance
,
as
it
speed
away
,
with
a
long
gaunt
shadow
following
at
its
heel
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
short
-
winded
locksmith
have
no
chance
against
a
man
of
Sim
's
youth
and
spare
figure
,
though
the
day
have
be
when
he
could
have
run
him
down
in
no
time

<EOS>
the
space
between
them
rapidly
increase
,
and
as
the
ray
of
the
rise
sun
stream
upon
Simon
in
the
act
of
turn
a
distant
corner
,
Gabriel
Varden
be
fain
to
give
up
,
and
sit
down
on
a
doorstep
to
fetch
his
breath
.

his

<EOS>
"
go
thy
way
,
Sim
,
go
thy
way
,
"
say
the
locksmith
,
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
my
good
for
thee
,
poor
lad
,
and
would
have
save
thee
,
but
the
rope
be
round
thy
neck

I
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
and
shake
his
head
in
a
very
sorrowful
and
disconsolate
manner

he
turn
back
,
and
soon
re
-
enter
his
own
house
,
where
Mrs
Varden
and
the
faithful
Miggs
have
be
anxiously
expect
his
return
.
  
<EOS>
now
Mrs
Varden
(
and
by
consequence
Miss
Miggs
likewise
)
be
impressed
with
a
secret
misgiving
that
she
have
do
wrong
;
that
she
have
,
to
the
utmost
of
her
small
mean
,
aid
and
abet
the
growth
of
disturbance
,
the
end
of
which
it
be
impossible
to
foresee
;
that
she
have
lead
remotely
to
the
scene
which
have
just
pass
;
and
that
the
locksmith
's
time
for
triumph
and
reproach
have
now
arrive
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
strongly
do
Mrs
Varden
feel
this
,
and
so
crestfallen
be
she
in
consequence
,
that
while
her
husband
be
pursue
their
lose
journeyman
,
she
secrete
under
her
chair
the
little
red
-
brick
dwelling
-
house
with
the
yellow
roof
,
lest
it
should
furnish
new
occasion
for
reference
to
the
painful
theme
;
and
now
hide
the
same
still
more
,
with
the
skirt
of
her
dress
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
happen
that
the
locksmith
have
be
think
of
this
very
article
on
his
way
home
,
and
that
,
come
into
the
room
and
not
see
it
,
he
at
once
demand
where
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
have
no
resource
but
to
produce
it
,
which
she
do
with
many
tear
,
and
broken
protestation
that
if
she
could
have
know
---
   
"
<EOS>
yes
,

"
say
Varden
,
"
<EOS>
of
course
---
I
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
reproach
you
,
my

<EOS>
but
recollect
from
this
time
that
all
good
thing
pervert
to
evil
purpose
,
be
bad
than
those
which
be
naturally
bad

<EOS>
a
thoroughly
wicked
woman
,
be
wicked
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
when
religion
go
wrong
,
she
be
very
wrong
,
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
,
my

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
he
drop
the
red

brick
dwelling
-
house
on
the
floor
,
and
set
his
heel
upon
it
,
crush
it

the

It

return
Hugh

shake
back
his

glance
towards

they
lay

at

stand
sentry
in

softly

pace
slowly
up

down

the
careful
arrangement
of

show
how
high

the
sunlight

Sabbath
sound
to

the

such

wallowing

wickedness

brimfull
of
pleasant
expectation

Mr

have
revenge

all
that

get
on

now
you
talk

indeed

"
  
"
<EOS>
ha
ha

<EOS>
the
captain
,
"
add
Hugh
,
"
have
thought
of
carry
off
a
woman
in
the
bustle
,
and
---

and
so
have
I

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
receive
this
part
of
the
scheme
with
a
wry
face
,
observe
that
as
a
general
principle
he
object
to
woman
altogether
,
as
be
unsafe
and
slippery
person
on
whom
there
be
no
calculate
with
any
certainty
,
and
who
be
never
in
the
same
mind
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
at
a
stretch
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
expatiate
on
this
suggestive
theme
at
much
great
length
,
but
that
it
occur
to
him
to
ask
what
connection
exist
between
the
propose
expedition
and
Barnaby
's
be
post
at
the
stable
-
door
as
sentry
;
to
which
Hugh
cautiously
reply
in
these
word
:
  
"
why
,
the
people
we
mean
to
visit
,
be
friend
of
his
,
once
upon
a
time
,
and
I
know
that
much
of
him
to
feel
pretty
sure
that
if
he
think
we
be
go
to
do
them
any
harm
,
he
would
be
no
friend
to
our
side
,
but
would
lend
a
ready
hand
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
have
persuade
him
(
for
I
know
him
of
old
)
that
Lord
George
have
pick
him
out
to
guard
this
place
to
-
morrow
while
we
be
away
,
and
that
it
be
a
great
honour
---
and
so
he
be
on
duty
now
,
<EOS>
and
as
proud
of
it
as
if
he
be
a
general
.
 
<EOS>
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
me
for
a
careful
man
as
well
as
a
devil
of
a
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
exhaust
himself
in
compliment
,
and
then
add
,
  
"
<EOS>
but
about
the
expedition
itself
---
"
  
"
about
that
,
"
say
Hugh
,
"
you
shall
hear
all
particular
from
me
and
the
great

both
together

he
add
,
roll
back
the
straw
,
and
point
to
where
the
ground
be
newly
turn

to

<EOS>
drink

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
receive
these
jovial
prompting
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
be
much
the
bad
,
both
in
mind
and
body
,
for
his
two
night
of
debauch
,
and
but
indifferently
able
to
stand
upon
his
leg
.
 
<EOS>
with
Hugh
's
assistance
,
however
,
he
contrive
to
stagger
to
the
pump
;
and
have
refresh
himself
with
an
abundant
draught
of
cold
water
,
and
a
copious
shower
of
the
same
refresh
liquid
on
his
head
and
face
,
he
order
some
rum
and
milk
to
be
serve
;
and
upon
that
innocent
beverage
and
some
biscuit
and
cheese
make
a
pretty
hearty
meal
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
he
dispose
himself
in
an
easy
attitude
on
the
ground
beside
his
two
companion
(
who
be
carouse
after
their
own
taste
)
,
and
proceed
to
enlighten
Mr
Dennis
in
reference
to
to
-
morrow
's
project
.
  
<EOS>
that
their
conversation
be
an
interesting
one
,
be
render
manifest
by
its
length
,
and
by
the
close
attention
of
all
three
.
<EOS>
that
it
be
not
of
an
oppressively
grave
character
,
but
be
enliven
by
various
pleasantry
arise
out
of
the
subject
,
be
clear
from
their
loud
and
frequent
roar
of
laughter
,
which
startle
Barnaby
on
his
post
,
and
make
him
wonder
at
their
levity
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
summon
to
join
them
,
until
they
have
eat
,
and
drunk
,
and
sleep
,
and
talk
together
for
some
hour
;
<EOS>
not
,
indeed
,
until
the
twilight
;
when
they
inform
him
that
they
be
about
to
make
a
slight
demonstration
in
the
street
---
just
to
keep
the
people
's
hand
in
,
as
it
be
Sunday
night
,
and
the
public
may
otherwise
be
disappoint
---
and
that
he
be
free
to
accompany
them
if
he
would
.
  
<EOS>
without
the
slight
preparation
,
save
that
they
carry
club
and
wear
the
blue
cockade
,
they
sally
out
into
the
street
;
and
,
with
no
more
settled
design
than
that
of
do
as
much
mischief
as
they
could
,
parade
them
at
random
.
 
<EOS>
Their
number
rapidly
increase
,
they
soon
divide
into
party
;
and
agree
to
meet
by
-
and
-
by
,
in
the
field
near
Welbeck
Street
,
scour
the
town
in
various
direction
.
 
<EOS>
the
large
body
,
and
that
which
augment
with
the
great
rapidity
,
be
the
one
to
which
Hugh
and
Barnaby
belong
.
 
<EOS>
this
take
its
way
towards
Moorfields
,
where
there
be
a
rich
chapel
,
and
in
which
neighbourhood
several
catholic
family
be
know
to
reside
.
  
<EOS>
begin
with
<EOS>
the
private
house
so
occupied
,
they
break
open
the
door
and
window
;
and
while
they
destroy
the
furniture
and
leave
but
the
bare
wall
,
make
a
sharp
search
for
tool
and
engine
of
destruction
,
such
as
hammer
,
poker
,
axis
,
saw
,
and
such
like
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
rioter
make
belt
of
cord
,
of
handkerchiefs
,
or
any
material
they
find
at
hand
,
and
wear
these
weapon
as
openly
as
pioneer
upon
a
field
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
least
disguise
or
concealment
---
indeed
,
on
this
night
,
very
little
excitement
or
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
chapel
,
they
tear
down
and
take
away
the
very
altar
,
bench
,
pulpit
,
pew
,
and
floor
;
from
the
dwelling
-
house
,
the
very
wainscoting
and
stair
.
 
<EOS>
this
Sunday
evening
's
recreation
<EOS>
they
pursue
like
mere
workman
who
have
a
certain
task
to
do
,
and
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
fifty
resolute
man
may
have
turn
them
at
any
moment
;
a
single
company
of
soldier
could
have
scatter
them
like
dust
;
but
no
man
interpose
,
no
authority
restrain
them
,
and
,
except
by
the
terrified
person
who
flee
from
their
approach
,
they
be
as
little
heeded
as
if
they
be
pursue
their
lawful
occupation
with
the
utmost
sobriety
and
good
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
,
they
march
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
agree
upon
,
make
great
fire
in
the
field
,
and
reserve
the
most
valuable
of
their
spoil
,
burn
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
priestly
garment
,
image
of
saint
,
rich
stuff
and
ornament
,
altar
-
furniture
and
household
good
,
be
cast
into
the
flame
,
and
shed
a
glare
on
the
whole
country
round
;
but
they
dance
and
howl
,
and
roar
about
these
fire
till
they
be
tired
,
and
be
never
for
an
instant
check
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
main
body
file
off
from
this
scene
of
action
,
and
pass
down
Welbeck
Street
,
they
come
upon
Gashford
,
who
have
be
a
witness
of
their
proceeding
,
and
be
walk
stealthily
along
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
keep
up
with
him
,
and
yet
not
seem
to
speak
,
Hugh
mutter
in
his
ear
:
  
"
<EOS>
be
this
well
,
master
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
have
?
"
say
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
fever
be
never
at
their
height
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
get
on
by
degree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
you
,
"
say
Gashford
,
pinch
his
arm
with
such
malevolence
that
his
nail
seem
to
meet
in
the
skin
;
"
I
would
have
you
put
some
meaning
into
your
work
.
 
<EOS>
Fools
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
make
no
well
bonfire
than
of
rag
and
scrap
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
burn
nothing
whole
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
a
little
patience
,
master
,
"
say
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
wait
but
a
few
hour
,
and
you
shall
see
.
 
<EOS>
look
for
a
redness
in
the
sky
,
to
-
morrow
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
fall
back
into
his
place
beside
Barnaby
;
and
when
the
secretary
look
after
him
,
both
be
lose
in
the
crowd
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
53
    
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
usher
in
by
merry
peal
of
bell
,
and
by
the
firing
of
the
Tower
gun
;
flag
be
hoist
on
many
of
the
church
-
steeple
;
the
usual
demonstration
be
make
in
honour
of
the
anniversary
of
the
King
's
birthday
;
and
every
man
go
about
his
pleasure
or
business
as
if
the
city
be
in
perfect
order
,
and
there
be
no
half
-
smoulder
ember
in
its
secret
place
,
which
,
on
the
approach
of
night
,
would
kindle
up
again
and
scatter
ruin
and
dismay
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
the
leader
of
the
riot
,
render
still
more
daring
by
the
success
of
last
night
and
by
the
booty
they
have
acquire
,
keep
steadily
together
,
and
only
think
of
implicate
the
mass
of
their
follower
so
deeply
that
no
hope
of
pardon
or
reward
may
tempt
them
to
betray
their
more
notorious
confederate
into
the
hand
of
justice
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
sense
of
have
go
too
far
to
be
forgive
,
hold
the
timid
together
no
less
than
the
bold
.
 
<EOS>
many
who
would
readily
have
point
out
the
foremost
rioter
and
give
evidence
against
them
,
feel
that
escape
by
that
means
be
hopeless
,
when
their
every
act
have
be
observe
by
score
of
people
who
have
take
no
part
in
the
disturbance
;
who
have
suffer
in
their
person
,
peace
,
or
property
,
by
the
outrage
of
the
mob
;
who
would
be
most
willing
witness
;
and
whom
the
government
would
,
no
doubt
,
prefer
to
any
King
's
evidence
that
may
be
offer
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
this
class
have
desert
their
usual
occupation
on
the
Saturday
morning
;
some
have
be
see
by
their
employer
active
in
the
tumult
;
other
know
they
must
be
suspect
,
and
that
they
would
be
discharge
if
they
return
;
other
have
be
desperate
from
the
beginning
,
and
comfort
themselves
with
the
homely
proverb
,
that
,
be
hang
at
all
,
they
may
as
well
be
hang
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
hope
and
believe
,
in
a
great
or
less
degree
,
that
the
government
they
seem
to
have
paralysed
,
would
,
in
its
terror
,
come
to
term
with
them
in
the
end
,
and
suffer
them
to
make
their
own
condition
.
 
<EOS>
the
least
sanguine
among
them
reason
with
himself
that
,
at
the
bad
,
they
be
too
many
to
be
all
punish
,
and
that
he
have
as
good
a
chance
of
escape
as
any
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
mass
never
reason
or
think
at
all
,
but
be
stimulate
by
their
own
headlong
passion
,
by
poverty
,
by
ignorance
,
by
the
love
of
mischief
,
and
the
hope
of
plunder
.
  
<EOS>
one
other
circumstance
be
worthy
of
remark
;
and
that
is
,
that
from
the
moment
of
their
first
outbreak
at
Westminster
,
every
symptom
of
order
or
preconcerte
arrangement
among
them
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
divide
into
party
and
run
to
different
quarter
of
the
town
,
it
be
on
the
spontaneous
suggestion
of
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
each
party
swell
as
it
go
along
,
like
river
as
they
roll
towards
the
sea
;
new
leader
spring
up
as
they
be
want
,
disappear
when
the
necessity
be
over
,
and
reappear
at
the
next
crisis
.
 
<EOS>
each
tumult
take
shape
and
form
from
the
circumstance
of
the
moment
;
sober
workman
,
go
home
from
their
day
's
labour
,
be
see
to
cast
down
their
basket
of
tool
and
become
rioter
in
an
instant
<EOS>
;
mere
boy
on
errand
do
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
a
moral
plague
run
through
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
the
noise
,
and
hurry
,
and
excitement
,
have
for
hundred
and
hundred
an
attraction
they
have
no
firmness
to
resist
.
 
<EOS>
the
contagion
spread
like
a
dread
fever
:
an
infectious
madness
,
as
yet
not
near
its
height
,
seize
on
new
victim
every
hour
,
and
society
begin
to
tremble
at
their
raving
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
between
two
and
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
when
Gashford
look
into
the
lair
describe
in
the
last
chapter
,
and
see
only
Barnaby
and
Dennis
there
,
inquire
for
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
out
,
Barnaby
tell
him
;
have
go
out
more
than
an
hour
ago
;
and
have
not
yet
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dennis
!
"
say
the
smile
secretary
,
in
his
smooth
voice
,
as
he
sit
down
cross
-
legged
on
a
barrel
,
"
Dennis
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
hangman
struggle
into
a
sit
posture
directly
,
and
with
his
eye
wide
open
,
look
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
Dennis
?
"
say
Gashford
,
nodding
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
suffer
no
inconvenience
from
your
late
exertion

Dennis

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
will
say
of
you

return
the
hangman
,
stare
at
him
,
"
that
that
'
ere
quiet
way
of
yours
may
almost
wake
a
dead
man

<EOS>
It
be
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
muttered
oath
---
still
stare
at
him
in
a
thoughtful
manner
---
"
so
awful
sly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
distinct

eh
Dennis
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
distinct

"
<EOS>
he
answer
,
scratch
his
head
,
and
keep
his
eye
upon
the
secretary
's
face
;
"
I
seem
to
hear
it
,
Muster
Gashford
,
in
my
wery
bone

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
your

two

at

at
each
other
;

burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter

brandish
their
stave
above
their
head
,
shake
hand
,
and
hurry
out

they
have
be
go
a
little
time

Gashford
follow
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
yet
in
sight
,

hasten
to
that
part
of
the
adjacent
field
in
which
their
fellow
have
already
muster
;
Hugh
be
look
back
,
and
flourish
his
hat
to
Barnaby
,
who
,
delighted
with
his
trust

reply
in
the

way

then
resume
his
pacing
up
and
down
before
the
stable

door

where
his
foot
have
wear
a
path
already

look
back

he
be
still
walk
to

measured
tread

most
devoted

the
blithe
champion

a
post

feel
his
heart
lift
up
with
a
brave
sense
of
duty

determination
to
defend
it
to
the
last

smile
at
the
simplicity
of
the
poor
idiot

betook
himself
to
Welbeck
Street
by
a
different
path
from
that
which
he
know
the
rioter
would
take
,
and
sit
down
behind
a
curtain
in
one
of
the
upper
window
of
Lord
George
Gordon

house

wait
impatiently

their
come

be
so
long
,
that
although
he
know
it
have
be
settle
they
should
come
that
way

he
have
a
misgiving
they
must
have
change
their
plan

take
some
other
route
.
 
<EOS>

at
length
the
roar
of
voice
be
hear
in
the
neighbouring
field

soon
afterwards
they
come
throng
past

in

great
body

not
all

give
three
cheer

on

out

whence

Gay

stop
to
let

pass
,
or
turn
back
to
avoid
them
;
people
on
foot
stand
aside
in
doorway
,
or
perhaps
knock
and
beg
permission
to
stand
at
a
window
,
or
in
the
hall
,
until
the
rioter
have
pass
:
but
nobody
interfere
with

and
when
they

everything
go
on

<EOS>
there

those
of
Simon

Hugh

in
the
front

of

<EOS>
They
halt
and
cheer

as

but
when
they
move
again
,
they
do
not

like
them
,
proclaim
what
design
they
have
.
<EOS>
Hugh
merely
raise
his

upon

Sir

<EOS>
He
hold
his
hat
an
inch

two
above
his

to
propitiate
the

and

rest
gracefully
on
his
cane
,
smile
pleasantly
,
and
display
his
dress
and
person
to
the
very
good
advantage
,
look
on

the
most
tranquil
state
imaginable

<EOS>
for
all
that

and
quick
and
dexterous
as
he
be

Gashford
have
see
him
recognise
Hugh
with
the
air
of
a
patron
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
longer
any
eye
for
the
crowd
,
but
fix
his
keen
regard
upon
Sir
John

<EOS>
He
stand
in
the

place
and
posture
until
the
last
man
in
the
concourse
have
turn
the
corner
of
the
street
;
then
very
deliberately
take
the
blue
cockade
out
of
his
hat
;
put
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
,
ready
for
the
next
emergency

refresh
himself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
;
put
up

after
a
minute

conversation
at
the
carriage

window

in
which
it
be
apparent
that
he
be
vastly
entertaining
on
the
subject
of
the
mob
,
he
step
lightly
in
,
and
be
drive
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
secretary
smile
,
but
he
have
other
thought
to
dwell
upon
,
and
soon
dismiss
the
topic
.
 
<EOS>
Dinner

him

but
he
send
it
down
untasted

and
,
in
restless
pacing
up

down
the
room
,
and
constant
glance
at
the
clock
,
and
many
futile
effort
to
sit
down
and
read

or
go
to
sleep

or
look
out

consume
four

when

upstairs
to

and
come
out
upon
the
roof
sit
down

with
his
face
towards
the
east

<EOS>
heedless
of
the
fresh
air
that
blow
upon
his
heated
brow
,
of
the
pleasant
meadow
from

the
distant

turmoil
of
the
town

the
cheerful

Rumours
of
the
prevail
disturbance
have
,
by
this
time
,
begin
to
be
pretty
generally
circulate
through
the
town
and
village
round
London
,
and
the
tiding
be
everywhere
receive
with
that
appetite
for
the
marvellous
and
love
of
the
terrible
which
have
probably
be
among
the
natural
characteristic
of
mankind
since
the
creation
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
these
account
,
however
,
appear
,
to
many
person
at
that
day
---
as
they
would
to
us
at
the
present
,
but
that
we
know
them
to
be
matter
of
history
---
so
monstrous
and
improbable
,
that
a
great
number
of
those
who
be
resident
at
a
distance
,
and
who
be
credulous
enough
on
other
point
,
be
really
unable
to
bring
their
mind
to
believe
that
such
thing
could
be
;
and
reject
the
intelligence
they
receive
on
all
hand
,
as
wholly
fabulous
and
absurd
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
---
not
so
much
,
perhaps
,
on
account
of
his
have
argue
and
settle
the
matter
with
himself
,
as
by
reason
of
his
constitutional
obstinacy
---
be
one
of
those
who
positively
refuse
to
entertain
the
current
topic
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
very
evening
,
and
perhaps
at
the
very
time
when
Gashford
keep
his
solitary
watch
,
old
John
be
so
red
in
the
face
with
perpetually
shake
his
head
in
contradiction
of
his
three
ancient
crony
and
pot
companion
,
that
he
be
quite
a
phenomenon
to
behold
,
and
light
up
the
Maypole
Porch
<EOS>
wherein
they
sit
together
,
like
a
monstrous
carbuncle
in
a
fairy
tale
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
Willet
,
look
hard
at
Solomon
Daisy
---
for
it
be
his
custom
in
case
of
personal
altercation
to
fasten
upon
the
small
man
in
the
party
---
"
do
you
think
,
sir
,
that
I
be
a
bear
fool
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
no
,
Johnny
,
"
return
Solomon
,
look
round
upon
the
little
circle
of
which
he
form
a
part
:
"
We
all
know
better

that

<EOS>
You
be
no
fool

<EOS>
no

"
  
<EOS>
Mr

and
Mr

shake
their
head
in
unison
,
muttering
,
"
no

no

Johnny

not
you

"
 
<EOS>
but
as
such
compliment
have
usually
the
effect
of
make
Mr
Willet
rather
more
dogged
than
before
,
he
survey
them
with
a
look
of
deep
disdain
,
and
return
for
answer
:
  
"
<EOS>
then
what
do
you
mean
by
come
here
,
and
tell
me
that
this
evening
you
be

his

an

solemn

the

plead
Parkes

humbly

<EOS>
"
You

I
tell
you
that
His
bless
Majesty
King
George
the
Third
would
no
more
stand
a
rioting
and
rollick
in

over
by
his
own
Parliament

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

Johnny

but
that
be
your

not

say
the
adventurous
Mr

<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know

<EOS>
"
retort
John
with
great
dignity

<EOS>
"
You

I

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Parkes
,
find
himself
in
the
position
of
have
get
into
metaphysic
without
exactly
see
his
way
out
of
them
,
stammer
forth
an
apology
and
retreat
from
the
argument
.
 
<EOS>
there
then
ensue
a
silence
of
some
ten
minute
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
period
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
be
observe
to
rumble
and
shake
with
laughter
,
and
presently
remark
,
in
reference
to
his
late
adversary
,
"
that
he
hope
he
have
tackle
him
enough
.
"
<EOS>
Thereupon
Messrs
Cobb
and
Daisy
laugh
,
and
nod
,
and
Parkes
be
look
upon
as
thoroughly
and
effectually
put
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
if
all
this

true

that
Mr

would
be
constantly
away
from

as
he
be
?
"
say
John
,
after
another
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
he
would
not
be
afraid
to
leave
his
house
with
them
two
young

only
a
couple
of
man

so

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay

then
you
know

"
return
Solomon
Daisy
,
"
his
house
be
a
goodish
way
out
of
London

and
they
do
say
that
the
rioter
will
not
go
more
than
two
mile
,
or
three
at
the
farth
,
off
the
stone
.
<EOS>
besides
,
you
know

some
of
the
catholic
gentlefolk
have
actually
send

well

say
Solomon

rise

to
divert
the
attention

his
two
friend

titter
at
this
retort
:

believe

it

"
  
<EOS>
the
three
crony
be
therefore
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
shake
his
elbow
;
have
perform
that
ceremony
,
and
bring
from
the
house
their
hat
,
and
stick
,
and
greatcoat

they
bid
him
good
night
and
depart
;
promise
to
bring
him
on
the
morrow
full
and
true
account
of
the
real
state
of
the
city

if
it

quiet

to
give
him
the
full
merit

his
victory

<EOS>
John
Willet
look
after
them
,
as
they
plod
along
the
road
in
the
rich
glow
of
a
summer
evening
;
and
knock
the
ashe
out
of
his
pipe
,
laugh
inwardly
at
their
folly
,
until
his
side
be
sore
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
quite
exhaust
himself
---
which
take
some
time
,
for
he
laugh
as
slowly
as
he
think
and
speak
---
he
sit
himself
comfortably
with
his
back
to
the
house
,
put
his
leg
upon
the
bench
,
then
his
apron
over
his
face
,
and
fall
sound
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
how
long
he
sleep
,
matter
not
;
but
it
be
for
no
brief
space
,
for
when
he
awake
,
the
rich
light
have
fade
<EOS>
,
the
sombre
hue
of
night
be
fall
fast
upon
the
landscape
,
and
a
few
bright
star
be
already
twinkle
overhead
.
 
<EOS>
the
bird
be
all
at
roost
,
the
daisy
on
the
green
have
close
their
fairy
hood
,
the
honeysuckle
twining
round
the
porch
exhale
its
perfume
in
a
twofold
degree
,
as
though
it
lose
its
coyness
at
that
silent
time
and
love
to
shed
its
fragrance
on
the
night
;
the
ivy
scarcely
stir
its
deep
green
leave
.
 
<EOS>
how
tranquil
,
and
how
beautiful
it
be
!
  
<EOS>
be
there
no
sound
in
the
air
,
besides
the
gentle
rustling
of
the
tree
and
the
grasshopper
's
merry
chirp
?
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
something
very
faint
and
distant
,
not
unlike
the
murmuring
in
a
sea
-
shell
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
grow
louder
,
fainter
now
,
and
now
it
altogether
die
away
.
<EOS>
presently
,
it
come
again
,
subside
,
come
once
more
,
grow
louder
,
fainter
---
swell
into
a
roar
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
road
,
and
vary
with
its
winding
.
 
<EOS>
all
at
once
it
burst
into
a
distinct
sound
---
the
voice
,
and
the
tramp
foot
of
many
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
questionable
whether
old
John
Willet
,
even
then
,
would
have
think
of
the
rioter
but
for
the
cry
of
his
cook
and
housemaid
,
who
run
scream
upstairs
and
lock
themselves
into
one
of
the
old
garret
,
---
shriek
dismally
when
they
have
do
so
,
by
way
of
render
their
place
of
refuge
perfectly
secret
and
secure
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
female
do
afterwards
depone
that
Mr
Willet
in
his
consternation
utter
but
one
word
,
and
call
that
up
the
stair
in
a
stentorian
voice
,
six
distinct
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
this
word
be
a
monosyllable
,
which
,
however
inoffensive
when
apply
to
the
quadrupe
it
denote
,
be
highly
reprehensible
when
use
in
connection
with
female
of
unimpeachable
character
,
many
person
be
incline
to
believe
that
the
young
woman
labour
under
some
hallucination
cause
by
excessive
fear
;
and
that
their
ear
deceive
them
.
  
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
John
Willet
,
in
whom
the
very
uttermost
extent
of
dull
-
head
perplexity
supply
the
place
of
courage
,
station
himself
in
the
porch
,
and
wait
for
their
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
it
dimly
occur
to
him
that
there
be
a
kind
of
door
to
the
house
,
which
have
a
lock
and

He

some

He

a

<EOS>
Mr

feebly
smack
his
lip
,
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket

and
inquire
what
be
to

;
add
,
as
he
look
vacantly
round

that
he
believe
there
be
a
trifle
of
broken

"
He

<EOS>
Dennis
,
with
a
wink
and
a
nod

unwound
the
cord
from

and
raise
his

to
the
ceiling
,
look
all
over

round

with

what

"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
make
no
answer
,
but
snatch
the
rope
from
his
companion
's
hand
,
proceed
to
bind
old
John
himself
;
but
his
very
first
move
be
so
bungling
and
unskilful
,
that
Mr
Dennis
entreat
,
almost
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
that
he
may
be
permit
to
perform
the
duty

<EOS>
Hugh
consenting

in

<EOS>
"
there

,
look
mournfully
at
John
Willet

who
display
no
more
emotion
in
his
bond
than
he
have
show
out
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
call
pretty

workmanlike

<EOS>
He
be
quite
a

<EOS>
but
,
brother

just
a
word
with

now
that

as
one
may
say
,
would
not
it
be
well
for
all
party
if
we
be
to

him
off

<EOS>
It
would
read
uncommon
well
in
the
newspaper
,
it
would
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
the
public
would
think
a
great
deal
more
on
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
,
infer
what
his
companion
mean
,
rather
from
his
gesture
than
his
technical
mode
of
express
himself
(
to
which
,
as
he
be
ignorant
of
his
calling
,
he
want
the
clue
)
,
reject
this
proposition
for
the
second
time

and
give
the
word
"
Forward
!
"
<EOS>
which
be
echo
by
a
hundred
voice
from

<EOS>
"
to

Dennis

a
loud
yell

and
the

hurried
off

mad
for
pillage
and
destruction

<EOS>
Hugh
linger
behind
for
a
few
moment
to
stimulate
himself
with
more
drink
,
and
to
set
all
the
tap
run
,
a
few
of
which
have
accidentally
be
spare
;
then
,
glance
round
the
despoiled
and
plundered
room
,
through
whose

window
the

have
thrust
the
Maypole
itself
,

motionless
John

Chapter
55
    
John
Willet
,
leave
alone
in
his
dismantle
bar
,
continue
to
sit
stare
about
him
;
awake
as
to
his
eye
,
certainly
,
but
with
all
his
power
of
reason
and
reflection
in
a
sound
and
dreamless
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
round
upon
the
room
which
have
be
for
year
,
and
be
within
an
hour
ago
,
the
pride
of
his
heart
;
and
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
be
move
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
,
without
,
look
black
and
cold
through
the
dreary
gap
in
the
casement
;
the
precious
liquid
,
now
nearly
leak
away
,
drip
with
a
hollow
sound
upon
the
floor
;
the
Maypole
peer
ruefully
in
through
the
break
window
,
like
the
bowsprit
of
a
wreck
ship
;
the
ground
may
have
be
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
it
be
so
strew
with
precious
fragment
.
 
<EOS>
current
of
air
rush
in
,
as
the
old
door
jar
and
creak
upon
their
hinge
;
the
candle
flicker
and
gutter
down
,
and
make
long
winding
-
sheet
;
the
cheery
deep
-
red
curtain
flap
and
flutter
idly
in
the
wind
;
even
the
stout
dutch
keg
,
overthrown
and
lie
empty
in
dark
corner
,
seem
the
mere
husk
of
good
fellow
whose
jollity
have
depart
,
and
who
could
kindle
with
a
friendly
glow
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
John
see
this
desolation
,
and
yet
see
it
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
content
to
sit
there
,
stare
at
it
,
and
feel
no
more
indignation
or
discomfort
in
his
bond
than
if
they
have
be
robe
of
honour
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
as
he
be
personally
concern
,
old
Time
lie
snore
,
and
the
world
stand
still
.
  
<EOS>
save
for
the
dripping
from
the
barrel
,
the
rustling
of
such
light
fragment
of
destruction
as
the
wind
affect
,
and
the
dull
creaking
of
the
open
door
,
all
be
profoundly
quiet
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
these
sound
,
like
the
ticking
of
the
death
-
watch
in
the
night
,
only
make
the
silence
they
invade
deep
and
more
apparent
.
 
<EOS>
but
quiet
or
noisy
,
it
be
all
one
to
John
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
train
of
heavy
artillery
could
have
come
up
and
commence
ball
practice
outside
the
window
,
it
would
have
be
all
the
same
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
long
way
beyond
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
a
ghost
could
not
have
overtake
him
.
  
<EOS>
by
and
by
he
hear
a
footstep
---
a
hurried
,
and
yet
cautious
footstep
---
come
on
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
stop
,
advanced
again
,
then
seem
to
go
quite
round
it
.
 
<EOS>
have
do
that
,
it
come
beneath
the
window
,
and
a
head
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
strongly
relieve
against
the
darkness
outside
by
the
glare
of
the
guttering
candle
.
 
<EOS>
a
pale
,
worn
,
withered
face
;
the
eye
---
 
but
that
be
owe
to
its
gaunt
condition
---
unnaturally
large
and
bright
;
the
hair
,
a
grizzle
black
.

It
give
a
search
glance
<EOS>
all
round
the

and
a
deep
voice
say
:
  
"
be
you
alone
in
this
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
John
make
no
sign
,
though
the
question
be
repeat
twice
,
and
he
hear
it
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
the
man
get
in
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
John
be
not
at
all
surprised
at
this
,
either
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
so
much
get
in
and
out
of
window
in
the
course
of
the
last
hour
or
so
,
that
he
have
quite
forget
the
door
,
and
seem
to
have
live
among
such
exercise
from
infancy
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
wear
a
large
,
dark
,
faded
cloak
,
and
a
slouched
hat
;
he
walk
up
close
to
John
,
and
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
John
return
the
compliment
with
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
have
you
be
sit
thus
?
"
say
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
John
consider
,
but
nothing
come
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
way
have
the
party
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
some
wander
speculation
relative
to
the
fashion
of
the
stranger
's
boot
,
get
into
Mr
Willet
's
mind
by
some
accident
or
other
,
but
they
get
out
again
in
a
hurry
,
and
leave
him
in
his
former
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
do
well
to
speak
,
"
say
the
man
;
"
you
may
keep
a
whole
skin
,
though
you
have
nothing
else
leave
that
can
be
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
which
way
have
the
party
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
!
"
say
John
,
find
his
voice
all
at
once
,
and
nod
with
perfect
good
faith
---
he
could
not
point
;
he
be
so
tightly
bind
---
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
to
the
right
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
lie
!
"
say
the
man
angrily
,
and
with
a
threaten
gesture
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
betray
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
so
evident
that
John
's
imperturbability
be
not
assume
,
but
be
the
result
of
the
late
proceeding
under
his
roof
,
that
the
man
stay
his
hand
in
the
very
act
of
strike
him
,
and
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
John
look
after
him
without
so
much
as
a
twitch
in
a
single
nerve
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
seize
a
glass
,
and
hold
it
under
one
of
the
little
cask
until
a
few
drop
be
collect
,
drank
them
greedily
off
;
then
throw
it
down
upon
the
floor
impatiently
,
he
take
the
vessel
in
his
hand
and
drain
it
into
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
some
scrap
of
bread
and
meat
be
scatter
about
,
and
on
these
he
fall
next
;
eat
them
with
voracity
,
and
pause
every
now
and
then
to
listen
for
some
fancied
noise
outside
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
refresh
himself
in
this
manner
with
violent
haste
,
and
raise
another
barrel
to
his
lip
,
he
pull
his
hat
upon
his
brow
as
though
he
be
about
to
leave
the
house
,
and
turn
to
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
your
servant
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
indistinctly
remember
to
have
hear
the
rioter
call
to
them
to
throw
the
key
of
the
room
in
which
they
be
,
out
of
window
,
for
their
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
reply
,
"
lock
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
for
them
if
they
remain
quiet
,
and
well
for
you
if
you

say
the
man

<EOS>
"
now
show
me
the
way

"
  
<EOS>
this
time
Mr
Willet
indicate
it
correctly
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
hurry
to
the
door
,
when
suddenly
there
come
towards
them
on
the
wind
,
the
loud
and
rapid
tolling
of
an
alarm
-
bell
,
and
then
a
bright
and
vivid
glare
stream
up
,
which
illumine
,
not
only
the
whole
chamber
,
but
all
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
sudden
change
from
darkness
to
this
dreadful
light
,
it
be
not
the
sound
of
distant
shriek
and
shout
of
triumph
,
it
be
not
this
dread
invasion
of
the
serenity
and
peace
of
night
,
that
drive
the
man
back
as
though
a
thunderbolt
have
strike
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
Bell
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
ghastliest
shape
the
human
mind
have
ever
picture
in
its
wildest
dream
have
rise
up
before
him
,
he
could
not
have
stagger
backward
from
its
touch
,
as
he
do
from
the
first
sound
of
that
loud
iron
voice
.
 
<EOS>
with
eye
that
start
from
his
head
,
his
limb
convulse
,
his
face
most
horrible
to
see
,
he
raise
one
arm
high
up
into
the
air
,
and
hold
something
visionary
back
and
down
,
with
his
other
hand
,
drive
at
it
as
though
he
hold
a
knife
and
stab
it
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
clutch
his
hair
,
and
stop
his
ear
,
and
travel
madly
round
and
round
;
then
give
a
frightful
cry
,
and
with
it
rush
away
:
still
,
still
,
the
Bell
toll
on
and
seem
to
follow
him
---
loud
and
louder
,
hot
and
hot
yet
.
 
<EOS>
the
glare
grow
bright
,
the
roar
of
voice
deeper
;
the
crash
of
heavy
body
fall
,
shake
the
air
;
bright
stream
of
spark
rise
up
into
the
sky
;
but
louder
than
them
all
---
 
rise
faster
far
,
to
Heaven
---
a
million
time
more
fierce
and
furious

pour
forth
dreadful
secret
after
its
long
silence

speak
the
language
of
the
dead
---
the
Bell
---
the
Bell

<EOS>
what
hunt
of
spectre
could
surpass
that
dread
pursuit
and
flight
!
<EOS>
have
there
be
a
legion
of
them
on
his
track

he
could
have
better
borne
it

<EOS>
They
would
have
have
a
beginning

an
end

but
here

full

<EOS>
the
one
pursue

it

owl
hoot
as
it
fly
upon
the
breeze
,
the
nightingale
be
silent
and
hide
herself
among
the
thick
bough
:
it
seem
to
goad
and
urge
the
angry
fire
,
and
lash
it
into
madness
;
everything
be
steep
in
one

red

the
glow
be
everywhere
;
nature
be
drench
in
blood

still
the
remorseless
crying

awful

the
Bell

<EOS>
It

but
not

<EOS>
no

ever
voice
like
that
which

and
warn
him
that
it

unceasingly
to
Heaven

<EOS>
who
could
hear
that
hell

and
not
know
what

<EOS>
there
be
murder
in
its
every
note

cruel

relentless

savage
murder
---
the
murder
of
a
confiding
man

by
one
who
hold
his
every
trust

Its
ring
summon
phantom

friendly
smile
change
to
a
look
of
half
incredulous
horror
,
which
stiffen
for
a
moment
into
one
of
pain
,
then
change
again
into
an
imploring
glance
at
Heaven
,
and
so
fall
idly
down
with
upturned
eye
,
like
the
dead
stag
'
he
have
often
peep
at
when
a
little
child
:
shrink
and
shuddering
<EOS>
---
there
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
think
of
now
!
<EOS>

and
cling
to
an
apron
as

look
!
 
<EOS>
He
sink
upon
the
ground
,
and
grovel
down
as
if
he
would
dig
himself
a
place
to
hide
in
,
cover
his
face
and
ear
:
but
no
,
no
,
no
,
---
a
hundred
wall
and
roof
of
brass
would
not
shut
out
that
bell
,
for
in
it
speak
the
wrathful
voice
of
God
,
and
from
that
voice
,
the
whole
wide
universe
could
not
afford
a
refuge

<EOS>
while

up

<EOS>
when
they
leave
the
Maypole
,
the
rioter
form
into
a
solid
body
,
and
advance
at
a
quick
pace
towards
the
Warren

<EOS>
rumour
of
their

they

the

profoundly
dark
:
not

<EOS>
after
some
fruitless
ringing
at
the
bell
,
and
beat
at
the
iron
gate
,
they
draw
off
a
few
pace
to
reconnoitre
,
and
confer
upon
the
course
it
would
be
good
to
take
.
  
<EOS>
very
little
conference

need
,
when
all
be
bent
upon
one
desperate
purpose
,
infuriate
with
liquor

flush
with
successful

<EOS>
the
word
be
give
to
surround
the
house
,
some
climb
the
gate
,
or
drop
into
the
shallow
trench
and
scale
the
garden
wall
,
while
other
pull
down
the
solid

and
during
their
absence
on
this
errand

themselves
with
knock
violently
at
the
door
,
and
call
to
those
within

to
come
down
and
open
them
on
peril
of
their

.
  
<EOS>
no

They

It

soon
to

strike
through
the

path
upon

London
;
and
avoid
the

which
be
hot
and
dusty

keep
to

path

the
field

<EOS>
as
they
draw
near
to
their
destination
,
they
begin
to
make
inquiry
of
the
people
whom
they
pass
,
concern
the
riot
,
and
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
story
they
have
hear
.
 
<EOS>
the
answer
go
far
beyond
any
intelligence
that
have
spread
to
quiet
Chigwell
.
 
<EOS>
one
man
tell
them
that
that
afternoon
the
Guards
,
convey
to
Newgate
some
rioter
who
have
be
re
-
examine
,
have
be
set
upon
by
the
mob
and
compel
to
retreat
;
another
,
that
the
house
of
two
witness
near
Clare
Market
be
about
to
be
pull
down
when
he
come
away
;
another
,
that
Sir
George
Saville
's
house
in
Leicester
Fields
be
to
be
burn
that
night
,
and
that
it
would
go
hard
with
Sir
George
if
he
fall
into
the
people
's
hand
,
as
it
be
he
who
have
bring
in
the
catholic
bill
.
 
<EOS>
all
account
agree
that
the
mob
be
out
,
in
strong
number
and
more
numerous
party
than
have
yet
appear
;
that
the
street
be
unsafe
;
that
no
man
's
house
or
life
be
worth
an
hour
's
purchase
;
that
the
public
consternation
be
increase
every
moment
;
and
that
many
family
have
already
flee
the
city
.
<EOS>
one
fellow
who
wear
the
popular
colour
,
damn
them
for
not
have
cockade
in
their
hat
,
and
bade
them
set
a
good
watch
to
-
morrow
night
upon
their
prison
door
,
for
the
lock
would
have
a
straining
;
another
ask
if
they
be
fire
-
proof
,
that
they
walk
abroad
without
the
distinguish
mark
of
all
good
and
true
man
;
---
and
a
third
who
ride
on
horseback
,
and
be
quite
alone
,
order
them
to
throw
each
man
a
shilling
,
in
his
hat
,
towards
the
support
of
the
rioter
.
 
<EOS>
although
they
be
afraid
to
refuse
compliance
with
this
demand
,
and
be
much
alarm
by
these
report
,
they
agree
,
have
come
so
far
,
to
go
forward
,
and
see
the
real
state
of
thing
with
their
own
eye
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
push
on
quicker
,
as
man
do
who
be
excite
by
portentous
news
;
and
ruminate
on
what
they
have
hear
,
speak
little
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
night
,
and
as
they
come
nearer
to
the
city
they
have
dismal
confirmation
of
this
intelligence
in
three
great
fire
,
all
close
together
,
which
burn
fiercely
and
be
gloomily
reflect
in
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
in
the
immediate
suburb
,
they
find
that
almost
every
house
have
chalk
upon
its
door
in
large
character
"
no
Popery
,
"
that
the
shop
be
shut
,
and
that
alarm
and
anxiety
be
depict
in
every
face
they
pass
.
  
<EOS>
note
these
thing
with
a
degree
of
apprehension
which
neither
of
the
three
care
to
impart
,
in
its
full
extent
,
to
his
companion
,
they
come
to
a
turnpike
-
gate
,
which
be
shut
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
pass
through
the
turnstile
on
the
path
,
when
a
horseman
ride
up
from
London
at
a
hard
gallop
,
and
call
to
the
toll
-
keeper
in
a
voice
of
great
agitation
,
to
open
quickly
in
the
name
of
God
.
  
<EOS>
the
adjuration
be
so
earnest
and
vehement
,
that
the
man
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
come
run
out
---
toll
-
keeper
though
he
be
---
 
and
be
about
to
throw
the
gate
open
,
when
happen
to
look
behind
him
,
he
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
what
be
that
!
 
<EOS>
another
fire
!
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
,
the
three
turn
their
head
,
and
see
in
the
distance
---
 
straight
in
the
direction
whence
they
have
come
---
a
broad
sheet
of
flame
,
cast
a
threatening
light
upon
the
cloud
,
which
glimmer
as
though
the
conflagration
be
behind
them
,
and
show
like
a
wrathful
sunset
.
  
<EOS>
"
My

the

by
lonely

His

who
have
listen
to

breathless
attention

start
that
moment
to
his

and
,
without

draw
Solomon
Daisy
to
the
door

mount
his
horse
,
take
him
up
behind

fly
rather
than
gallop
towards
the
pile
of
ruin

which
that
day

sun
have
shine
upon

a
stately
house

<EOS>
Mr

stare
after
them
,
listen
,
look
down
upon
himself
to
make
quite
sure
that
he
be
still
unbound
,
and
,
without
any
manifestation
of
impatience
,
disappointment
,
or
surprise
,
gently
relapse
into
the
condition

he
have
so
imperfectly

<EOS>
Mr

tie
his
horse
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
,
and
grasp
his
companion
's
arm
,
steal
softly
along
the
footpath
,
and
into
what
have
be
the
garden
of
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
for
an
instant
to
look
upon
its
smoking
wall
,
and
at
the
star
that
shine
through
roof
and
floor
upon
the
heap
of
crumble
ashe
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
glance
timidly
in
his
face
,
but
his
lip
be
tightly
press
together
,
a
resolute
and
stern
expression
sit
upon
his
brow
,
and
not
a
tear
,
a
look
,
or
gesture
indicate
grief
,
escape
him

<EOS>
He
draw
his
sword
;
feel
for
a
moment
in
his
breast
,
as
though
he
carry
other
arm
about
him
;
then
grasp
Solomon
by
the
wrist
again
,
go
with
a
cautious
step
all
round
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
into
every
doorway
and
gap
in
the
wall
;
retrace
his
step
at
every
rustling
of
the
air
among
the
leave
;
and
search
in
every
shadow
nook
with
outstretched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
thus
they
make
the
circuit
of
the
building
:
but
they
return
to
the
spot
from
which
they
have
set
out
,
without
encounter
any
human
being
,
or
find
the
least
trace
of
any
conceal
straggler
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
,
Mr
Haredale
shout
twice
or
thrice
.
 
<EOS>
then
cry
aloud
,
"
be
there
any
one
in
hiding
here
,
who
know
my
voice
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
fear
now

people
be
near

I
entreat

to
answer
!

<EOS>
He
call
them
all
by
name
;
his
voice
be
echo
in
many
mournful
tone
;
then
all
be
silent
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
stand
near
the
foot
of
the
turret
,
where
the
alarm
-
bell
hang
.
 
<EOS>
the
fire
have
rage
there
,
and
the
floor
have
be
saw
,
and
hewn
,
and
beat
down
,
besides
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
open
to
the
night
;
but
a
part
of
the
staircase
still
remain
,
wind
upward
from
a
great
mound
of
dust
and
cinder
.
 
<EOS>
fragment
of
the
jagged
and
broken
step
offer
an
insecure
and
giddy
footing
here
and
there
,
and
then
be
lose
again
,
behind
protrude
angle
of
the
wall
,
or
in
the
deep
shadow
cast
upon
it
by
other
portion
of
the
ruin
;
for
by
this
time
the
moon
have
rise
,
and
shine
brightly
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
stand
here
,
listen
to
the
echo
as
they
die
away
,
and
hope
in
vain
to
hear
a
voice
they
know
,
some
of
the
ashe
in
this
turret
slip
and
roll
down
.
 
<EOS>
startle
by
the
least
noise
in
that
melancholy
place
,
Solomon
look
up
in
his
companion
's
face
,
and
see
that
he
have
turn
towards
the
spot
,
and
that
he
watch
and
listen
keenly
.
  
<EOS>
He
cover
the
little
man
's
mouth
with
his
hand
,
and
look
again
.
<EOS>
instantly
,
with
kindle
eye
,
he
bid
him
on
his
life
keep
still
,
and
neither
speak
nor
move
.
 
<EOS>
then
hold
his
breath
,
and
stoop
down
,
he
steal
into
the
turret
,
with
his
draw
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
terrify
to
be
leave
there
by
himself
,
under
such
desolate
circumstance
,
and
after
all
he
have
see
and
hear
that
night
,
Solomon
would
have
follow
,
but
there
have
be
something
in
Mr
Haredale
's
manner
and
his
look
,
the
recollection
of
which
hold
him
spellbound
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
root
to
the
spot
;
and
scarcely
venture
to
breathe
,
look
up
with
mingled
fear
and
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
again
the
ashe
slip
and
roll
---
very
,
very
softly
---
again
---
and
then
again
,
as
though
they
crumble
underneath
the
tread
of
a
stealthy
foot
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
a
figure
be
dimly
visible
;
climb
very
softly
;
and
often
stop
to
look
down
;
now
it
pursue
its
difficult
way
;
and
now
it
be
hide
from
the
view
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
emerge
once
more
,
into
the
shadowy
and
uncertain
light
---
high
now
,
but
not
much
,
for
the
way
be
steep
and
toilsome
,
and
its
progress
very
slow
.
 
<EOS>
what
phantom
of
the
brain
do
he
pursue
;
and
why
do
he
look
down
so
constantly
?
 
<EOS>
He
know
he
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
surely
his
mind
be
not
affect
by
that
night
's
loss
and
agony
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
about
to
throw
himself
headlong
from
the
summit
of
the
totter
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
turn
sick
,
and
clasp
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
limb
tremble
beneath
him
,
and
a
cold
sweat
break
out
upon
his
pallid
face
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
comply
with
Mr
Haredale
's
last
injunction
now
,
it
be
because
he
have
not
the
power
to
speak
or
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
strain
his
gaze
,
and
fix
it
on
a
patch
of
moonlight
,
into
which
,
if
he
continue
to
ascend
,
he
must
soon
emerge
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
appear
there
,
he
would
try
to
call
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
again
the
ashe
slip
and
crumble
;
some
stone
roll
down
,
and
fall
with
a
dull
,
heavy
sound
upon
the
ground
below
.
 
<EOS>
He
keep
his
eye
upon
the
piece
of
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
the
figure
be
come
on
,
for
its
shadow
be
already
throw
upon
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
appear
---
and
now
look
round
at
him
---
and
now
---
   
<EOS>
the
horror
-
stricken
clerk
utter
a
scream
that
pierce
the
air
,
and
cry
,
"
the

<EOS>
the
ghost

long
before
the

of
his

have
die
away

another

rush
out
into
the
light

fling
itself
upon
the
foremost

knelt
down
upon

clutch
its
throat
with
both

her
look
when

be
in
such
high
esteem
:
<EOS>
bold
among
the
bold
,

<EOS>
and
when
these
fray
be
over

and
the
good
lord
have
conquer
his
enemy
,
and
they
be
all
at
peace
again

and
he
and
she
be
rich
,
what
happiness
they
would
have
in
talk
of
these
troubled
time
when
he
be
a
great
soldier
:
and
when
they
sit
alone
together
in
the
tranquil
twilight
,
and
she
have
no
long
reason
to
be
anxious
for
the
morrow
,
what
pleasure
would
he
have
in
the
reflection
that
this
be
his
doing
---
<EOS>
his
---
poor
foolish
Barnaby
's
;
and
in
pat
her
on
the
cheek
,
and
say
with
a
merry
laugh
,
"
be
I
silly
now
,
mother
<EOS>
---
be
I
silly
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
with
a
light
heart
and
step
,
and
eye
the
bright
for
the
happy
tear
that
dim
them
for
a
moment
,
Barnaby
resume
his
walk
;
and
singe
gaily
to
himself
,
keep
guard
upon
his
quiet
post
.
  
<EOS>
His
comrade
Grip
,
the
partner
of
his
watch
,
though
fond
of
basking
in
the
sunshine
,
prefer
to
-
day
to
walk
about
the
stable
;
have
a
great
deal
to
do
in
the
way
of
scatter
the
straw
,
hide
under
it
such
small
article
as
have
be
casually
leave
about
,
and
haunt
Hugh
's
bed
,
to
which
he
seem
to
have
take
a
particular
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
Barnaby
look
in
and
call
him
,
and
then
he
come
hop
out
;
but
he
merely
do
this
as
a
concession
to
his
master
's
weakness
,
and
soon
return
again
to
his
own
grave
pursuit
:
peer
into
the
straw
with
his
bill
,
and
rapidly
cover
up
the
place
,
as
if
,
Midas
-
like
,
he
be
whisper
secret
to
the
earth
and
bury
them
;
constantly
busy
himself
upon
the
sly
;
and
affect
,
whenever
Barnaby
come
past
,
to
look
up
in
the
cloud
and
have
nothing
whatever
on
his
mind
:
in
short
,
conduct
himself
,
in
many
respect
,
in
a
more
than
usually
thoughtful
,
deep
,
and
mysterious
manner
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
day
creep
on
,
Barnaby
,
who
have
no
direction
forbid
him
to
eat
and
drink
upon
his
post
,
but
have
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
supply
with
a
bottle
of
beer
and
a
basket
of
provision
,
determine
to
break
his
fast
,
which
he
have
not
do
since
morning
.
<EOS>
to
this
end
,
he
sit
down
on
the
ground
before
the
door
,
and
put
his
staff
across
his
knee
in
case
of
alarm
or
surprise
,
summon
Grip
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
this
call
,
the
bird
obey
with
great
alacrity
;
cry
,
as
he
sidle
up
to
his
master
,
"
I

<EOS>
have
learn
this
latter
sentiment
from
the
gentry
among
whom
he
have
live
of
late
,
he
deliver
it
with
uncommon
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
say
,
Grip

"
<EOS>
cry
his
master
,
as
he
feed
him
with
the

the

,
place
his

upon
the

,
look
at
his

sideways
,
as
though
he
would
have
say
,
"
say
that
again
!
"
<EOS>
perfectly
understand
his
desire
,
Barnaby
repeat
the
phrase
a
great
many
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
bird
listen
with
profound
attention
;
sometimes
repeat
the
popular
cry
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
to
compare
the
two
,
and
try
if
it
would
at
all
help
him
to
this
new
accomplishment
;
sometimes
flap
his
wing
,
or
barking
;
and
sometimes
in
a
kind
of
desperation
draw
a
multitude
of
cork
,
with
extraordinary
viciousness
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
be
so
intent
upon
his
favourite
,
that
he
be
not
at
first
aware
of
the
approach
of
two
person
on
horseback
,
who
be
ride
at
a
foot
-
pace
,
and
come
straight
towards
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
perceive
them
,
however
,
which
he
do
when
they
be
within
some
fifty
yard
of
him
,
he
jump
hastily
up
,
and
order
Grip
within
door
,
stand
with
both
hand
on
his
staff
,
wait
until
he
should
know
whether
they
be
friend
or
foe
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
do
so
,
when
he
observe
that
those
who
advance
be
a
gentleman
and
his
servant
;
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
recognise
Lord
George
Gordon
,
before
whom
he
stand
uncovered
,
with
his
eye
turn
towards
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"

Lord

Barnaby

softly

and
make
the
banner
rustle
pleasantly
above
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
freedom
and
freshness
in
the
sound
and
in
the
time
,
which
chime
exactly
with
his
mood
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
happy
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
lean
on
his
staff
look
towards
the
decline
sun
,
and
reflect
with
a
smile
that
he
stand
sentinel
at
that
moment
over
bury
gold
,
when
two
or
three
figure
appear
in
the
distance
,
make
towards
the
house
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
motion
with
their
hand
as
though
they
urge
its
inmate
to
retreat
from
some
approach
danger
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
draw
near
,
they
become
more
earnest
in
their
gesture
;
and
they
be
no
sooner
within
hearing
,
than
the
foremost
among
them
cry
that
the
soldier
be
come
up
.
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
,
Barnaby
furl
his
flag
,
and
tie
it
round
the
pole
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
high
while
he
do
so
,
but
he
have
no
more
fear
or
thought
of
retreat
than
the
pole
itself
.
 
<EOS>
the
friendly
straggler
hurry
past
him
,
after
give
him
notice
of
his
danger
,
and
quickly
pass
into
the
house
,
where
the
utmost
confusion
immediately
prevail
.
 
<EOS>
as
those
within
hastily
close
the
window
and
the
door
,
they
urge
him
by
look
and
sign
to
fly
without
loss
of
time
,
and
call
to
him
many
time
to
do
so
;
but
he
only
shake
his
head
indignantly
in
answer
,
and
stand
the
firm
on
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
he
be
not
to
be
persuade
,
they
take
care
of
themselves
;
and
leave
the
place
with
only
one
old
woman
in
it
,
speedily
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
as
yet
there
have
be
no
symptom
of
the
news
have
any
well
foundation
than
in
the
fear
of
those
who
bring
it
,
but
the
Boot
have
not
be
desert
five
minute
,
when
there
appear
,
come
across
the
field
,
a
body
of
man
who
,
it
be
easy
to
see
,
by
the
glitter
of
their
arm
and
ornament
in
the
sun
,
and
by
their
orderly
and
regular
mode
of
advance
---
for
they
come
on
as
one
man
---
be
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
very
little
time
,
Barnaby
know
that
they
be
a
strong
detachment
of
the
Foot
Guards
,
have
along
with
them
two
gentleman
in
private
clothe
,
and
a
small
party
of
Horse
;
the
latter
bring
up
the
rear
,
and
be
not
in
number
more
than
six
or
eight
.
  
<EOS>
They
advance
steadily
;
neither
quicken
their
pace
as
they
come
nearer
,
nor
raise
any
cry
,
nor
show
the
least
emotion
or
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
though
this
be
a
matter
of
course
in
the
case
of
regular
troop
,
even
to
Barnaby
,
there
be
something
particularly
impressive
and
disconcert
in
it
to
one
accustom
to
the
noise
and
tumult
of
an
undisciplined
mob
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
that
,
he
stand
his
ground
not
a
whit
the
less
resolutely
,
and
look
on
undismayed
.
  
<EOS>
presently
,
they
march
into
the
yard
,
and
halt
.
 
<EOS>
the
commanding
-
officer
despatch
a
messenger
to
the
horseman
,
one
of
whom
come
ride
back
.
 
<EOS>
some
word
pass
between
them
,
and
they
glance
at
Barnaby
;
who
well
remember
the
man
he
have
unhorse
at
Westminster
,
and
see
him
now
before
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
speedily
dismiss
,
salute
,
and
ride
back
to
his
comrade
,
who
be
draw
up
apart
at
a
short
distance
.
  
<EOS>
the
officer
then
give
the
word
to
prime
and
load
.
 
<EOS>
the
heavy
ringing
of
the
musket
-
stock
upon
the
ground
,
and
the
sharp
and
rapid
rattling
of
the
ramrod
in
their
barrel
,
be
a
kind
of
relief
to
Batnahy
,
deadly
though
he
know
the
purport
of
such
sound
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
be
do
,
other
command
be
give
,
and
the
soldier
instantaneously
form
in
single
file
all
round
the
house
and
stable
;
completely
encircle
them
in
every
part
,
at
a
distance
,
perhaps
,
of
some
half
-
dozen
yard
;
at
least
that
seem
in
Barnaby
's
eye
to
be
about
the
space
leave
between
himself
and
those
who
confront
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
horseman
remain
draw
up
by
themselves
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
in
private
clothe
who
have
keep
aloof
,
now
ride
forward
,
one
on
either
side
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
the
proclamation
have
be
produce
and
read
by
one
of
them
,
the
officer
call
on
Barnaby
to
surrender
.
  
<EOS>
He
make
no
answer
,
but
step
within
the
door
,
before
which
he
have
keep
guard
,
hold
his
pole
crosswise
to
protect
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
a
profound
silence
,
he
be
again
call
upon
to
yield
.
  
<EOS>
still
he
offer
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
have
enough
to
do
,
to
run
his
eye
backward
and
forward
along
the
half
-
dozen
man
who
immediately
front
him
,
and
settle
hurriedly
within
himself
at
which
of
them
he
would
strike
first
,
when
they
press
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
catch
the
eye
of
one
in
the
centre
,
and
resolve
to
hew
that
fellow
down
,
though
he
die
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
again
there
be
a
dead
silence
,
and
again
the
same
voice
call
upon
him
to
deliver
himself
up
.
  
<EOS>
next
moment
he
be
back
in
the
stable
,
deal
blow
about
him
like
a
madman
.
 
<EOS>
two
of
the
man
lie
stretch
at
his
foot
<EOS>
:
the
one
he
have
mark
,
drop
first
---
he
have
a
thought
for
that
,
even
in
the
hot
blood
and
hurry
of
the
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
another
blow
---
another
!
 
<EOS>
down
<EOS>
,
master
,
wound
in
the
breast
by
a
heavy
blow
from
the
butt
-
end
of
a
gun
(
he
see
the
weapon
in
the
act
of
fall
)
---
<EOS>
breathless
---
and
a
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
an
exclamation
of
surprise
from
the
officer
recall
him
,
in
some
degree
,
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
round
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
,
after
work
in
secret
all
the
afternoon
,
and
with
redouble
vigour
while
everybody
's
attention
be
distract
,
have
pluck
away
the
straw
from
Hugh
's
bed
,
and
turn
up
the
loose
ground
with
his
iron
bill
.
<EOS>
the
hole
have
be
recklessly
fill
to
the
brim
,
and
be
merely
sprinkle
with
earth
.
 
<EOS>
golden
cup
,
spoon
,
candlestick
,
coin
guinea
---
all
the
rich
be
reveal
.
  
<EOS>
They
bring
spade
and
a
sack
;
dug
up
everything
that
be
hide
there
;
and
carry
away
more
than
two
man
could
lift
.
 
<EOS>
They
handcuff
him
and
bind
his
arm
,
search
him
,
and
take
away
all
he
have
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
question
or
reproach
him
,
or
seem
to
have
much
curiosity
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
man
he
have
stun
,
be
carry
off
by
their
companion
in
the
same
business
-
like
way
in
which
everything
else
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
he
be
leave
under
a
guard
of
four
soldier
with
fix
bayonet
,
while
the
officer
direct
in
person
the
search
of
the
house
and
the
other
building
connect
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
soon
complete
.
 
<EOS>
the
soldier
form
again
in
the
yard
;
he
be
march
out
,
with
his
guard
about
him
;
and
order
to
fall
in
,
where
a
space
be
leave
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
close
up
all
round
,
and
so
they
move
away
,
with
the
prisoner
in
the
centre
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
into
the
street
,
he
feel
he
be
a
sight
;
and
look
up
as
they
pass
quickly
along
,
could
see
people
run
to
the
window
a
little
too
late
,
and
throw
up
the
sash
to
look
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
meet
a
staring
face
beyond
the
head
about
him
,
or
under
the
arm
of
his
conductor
,
or
peer
down
upon
him
from
a
waggon
-
top
or
coach
-
box
;
but
this
be
all
he
see
,
be
surround
by
so
many
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
noise
of
the
street
seem
muffled
and
subdue
;
and
the
air
come
stale
and
hot
upon
him
,
like
the
sickly
breath
of
an
oven
.
  
<EOS>
Tramp
,
tramp
.
 
<EOS>
Tramp
,
tramp
.
 
<EOS>
head
erect
,
shoulder
square
,
every
man
step
in
exact
time
---
all
so
orderly
and
regular
---
<EOS>
nobody
look
at
him
---
nobody
seem
conscious
of
his
presence
,
---
he
could
hardly
believe
he
be
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
the
word
,
though
only
thought
,
not
speak
,
he
feel
the
handcuff
gall
his
wrist
,
the
cord
press
his
arm
to
his
side
:
<EOS>
the
loaded
gun
level
at
his
head
;
and
those
cold
,
bright
,
sharp
,
shine
point
turn
towards
him
:
the
mere
look
down
at
which
,
now
that
he
be
bind
and
helpless
,
make
the
warm
current
of
his
life
run
cold
.

Chapter
58
    
<EOS>
They
be
not
long
in
reach
the
barrack
,
for
the
officer
who
command
the
party
<EOS>
be
desirous
to
avoid
rouse
the
people
by
the
display
of
military
force
in
the
street
,
and
be
humanely
anxious
to
give
as
little
opportunity
as
possible
for
any
attempt
at
rescue
;
know
that
it
must
lead
to
bloodshed
and
loss
of
life
,
and
that
if
the
civil
authority
by
whom
he
be
accompany
,
empower
him
to
order
his
man
to
fire
,
many
innocent
person
would
probably
fall
,
whom
curiosity
or
idleness
have
attract
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
lead
the
party
briskly
on
,
avoid
with
a
merciful
prudence
the
more
public
and
crowded
thoroughfare
,
and
pursue
those
which
he
deem
least
likely
to
be
infest
by
disorderly
person
.
 
<EOS>
this
wise
proceeding
not
only
enable
them
to
gain
their
quarter
without
any
interruption
,
but
completely
baffle
a
body
of
rioter
who
have
assemble
in
one
of
the
main
street
,
through
which
it
be
consider
certain
they
would
pass
,
and
who
remain
gather
together
for
the
purpose
of
release
the
prisoner
from
their
hand
,
long
after
they
have
deposit
him
in
a
place
of
security
,
close
the
barrack
-
gate
,
and
set
a
double
guard
at
every
entrance
for
its
well
protection
.
  
<EOS>
arrive
at
this
place
,
poor
Barnaby
be
march
into
a
stone
-
floor
room
,
where
there
be
a
very
powerful
smell
of
tobacco
,
a
strong
thorough
draught
of
air
,
and
a
great
wooden
bedstead
,
large
enough
for
a
score
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
several
soldier
in
undress
be
lounge
about
,
or
eat
from
tin
can
;
military
accoutrement
dangle
on
row
of
peg
along
the
whitewashed
wall
;
and
some
half
-
dozen
man
lie
fast
asleep
upon
their
back
,
snore
in
concert
.
<EOS>
after
remain
here
just
long
enough
to
note
these
thing
,
he
be
march
out
again
,
and
convey
across
the
parade
-
ground
to
another
portion
of
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
a
man
never
see
so
much
at
a
glance
as
when
he
be
in
a
situation
of
extremity
.
 
<EOS>
the
chance
be
a
hundred
to
one
,
that
if
Barnaby
have
lounge
in
at
the
gate
to
look
about
him
,
he
would
have
lounge
out
again
with
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
the
place
,
and
would
have
remember
very
little
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
be
take
handcuff
across
the
gravelled
area
,
nothing
escape
his
notice
.
<EOS>
the
dry
,
arid
look
of
the
dusty
square
,
and
of
the
bare
brick
building
;
the
clothe
hang
at
some
of
the
window
;
and
the
man
in
their
shirt
-
sleeve
and
brace
,
loll
with
half
their
body
out
of
the
other
;
the
green
sun
-
blind
at
the
officer
'
quarter
,
and
the
little
scanty
tree
in
front
;
the
drummer
-
boy
practise
in
a
distant
courtyard
;
the
man
at
drill
on
the
parade
;
the
two
soldier
carry
a
basket
between
them
,
who
wink
to
each
other
as
he
go
by
,
and
slily
point
to
their
throat
;
the
spruce
serjeant
who
hurry
past
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
,
and
under
his
arm
a
clasp
book
with
a
vellum
cover
;
the
fellow
in
the
ground
-
floor
room
,
furbish
and
brush
up
their
different
article
of
dress
,
who
stop
to
look
at
him
,
and
whose
voice
as
they
speak
together
echo
loudly
through
the
empty
gallery
and
passage
;
---
 
everything
,
down
to
the
stand
of
musket
before
the
guard
-
house
,
and
the
drum
with
a
pipe
-
clay
belt
attach
,
in
one
corner
,
impress
itself
upon
his
observation
,
as
though
he
have
notice
them
in
the
same
place
a
hundred
time
,
or
have
be
a
whole
day
among
them
,
in
place
of
one
brief
hurry
minute
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
take
into
a
small
pave
back
yard
,
and
there
they
open
a
great
door
,
plate
with
iron
,
and
pierce
some
five
foot
above
the
ground
with
a
few
hole
to
let
in
air
and
light
.
 
<EOS>
into
this
dungeon
he
be
walk
straightway
;
and
have
lock
him
up
there
,
and
place
a
sentry
over
him
,
they
leave
him
to
his
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
the
cell
,
or
black
hole
,
for
it
have
those
word
paint
on
the
door
,
be
very
dark
,
and
have
recently
accommodate
a
drunken
deserter
,
by
no
means
clean
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
feel
his
way
to
some
straw
at
the
farther
end
,
and
look
towards
the
door
,
try
to
accustom
himself
to
the
gloom
,
which
,
come
from
the
bright
sunshine
out
of
door
,
be
not
an
easy
task
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
kind
of
portico
or
colonnade
outside
,
and
this
obstruct
even
the
little
light
that
at
the
good
could
have
find
its
way
through
the
small
aperture
in
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
footstep
of
the
sentinel
echo
monotonously
as
he
pace
its
stone
pavement
to
and
fro
(
remind
Barnaby
of
the
watch
he
have
so
lately
keep
himself
)
;
and
as
he
pass
and
repasse
the
door
,
he
make
the
cell
for
an
instant
so
black
by
the
interposition
of
his
body
,
that
his
go
away
again
seem
like
the
appearance
of
a
new
ray
of
light
,
and
be
quite
a
circumstance
to
look
for
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
prisoner
have
sit
sometime
upon
the
ground
,
gaze
at
the
chink
,
and
listen
to
the
advance
and
recede
footstep
of
his
guard
,
the
man
stand
still
upon
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
quite
unable
to
think
,
or
to
speculate
on
what
would
be
do
with
him

be
lull
into
a
kind
of
doze
by
his
regular
pace

his
stopping
rouse
him
;

then
he
become
aware
that
two
man
be
in
conversation
under
the
colonnade
,
and
very
near
the
door
of
his
cell
.
  
<EOS>
how
long
they
have
be
talk
there
,
he
could
not
tell
,
for
he
have
fall
into
an
unconsciousness
of
his
real
position
,
and
when
the
footstep
cease
,
be
answer
aloud
some
question
which
seem
to
have
be
put
to
him
by
Hugh
in
the
stable
,
though
of
the
fancied
purport
,
either
of
question
or
reply
,
notwithstanding
that
he
awake
with
the
latter
on
his
lip
,
he
have
no
recollection
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
word
that
reach
his
ear
,
be
these
:
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
he
bring
here
then
,
if
he
have
to
be
take
away
again
so
soon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
where
would
you
have
him
go
!
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
he
be
not
as
safe
anywhere
as
among
the
king
's
troop
,
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
what
WOULD
you
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
Would
you
hand
him
over
to
a
pack
of
cowardly
civilian
,
that
shake
in
their
shoe
till
they
wear
the
sol
out
,
with
tremble
at
the
threat
of
the
ragamuffin

belong
to

<EOS>
Barnaby
,
who
have
wit
enough
to
know
that
this
conversation
concern
,
and
very
nearly
concerned
,
himself
,
remain
perfectly
quiet
until
they
cease
to
speak
,
when
he
grope
his
way
to
the
door
,
and
peep
through
the
air
-
hole
,
try
to
make
out
what
kind
of
man
they
be
,
to
whom
he
have
be
listen
.
  
<EOS>
the
one
who
condemn
the
civil
power
in
such
strong
term
,
be
a
serjeant
---
engage
just
then
,
as
the
streaming
riband
in
his
cap
announce
,
on

recruiting
service

<EOS>
He
stand
lean
sideways
against
a
pillar
nearly
opposite
the
door
,
and
as
he
growl
to
himself
,
draw
figure
on
the
pavement
with
his
cane
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
man
have
his
back
towards
the
dungeon
,
and
Barnaby
could
only
see
his
form
.
 
<EOS>
to
judge
from
that
,
he
be
a
gallant
,
manly
,
handsome
fellow
,
but
he
have
lose
his
left
arm
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
take
off
between
the
elbow
and
the
shoulder
,
and
<EOS>
his
empty
coat
-
sleeve
hang
across
his
breast
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
probably
this
circumstance
which
give
him
an
interest
beyond
any
that
his
companion
could
boast
of
,
and
attract
Barnaby
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
soldierly
in
his
bearing
,
and
he
wear
a
jaunty
cap

jacket
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
be
in
the
service
at
one
time

other

it

this
latter
adjuration
be
address
to
the
serjeant

whom
Barnaby
judge
from
his
red
coat
to
be
high
in
office
,
and
able
to
seal
Grip
's
destiny
by
a
word

that
gentleman

in
reply

surlily
damn
him
for

he

with
many
disinterested
imprecation
on

You

have
vent
his
defiance

he
fling
himself
into
the
furth
corner

,
"

good

shed
tear
for
the
first
time
since
he
have
be
take
captive
;
and
hide
his
face
in
the
straw
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
have
some
fancy
at
first
,
that
the
one
-
armed
man
would
help
him
,
or
would
give
him
a
kind
word
in
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
hardly
know
why
,
but
he
hope
and
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
fellow
have
stop
when
he
call
out
,
and
check
himself
in
the
very
act
of
turn
round
,
stand
listen
to
every
word
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
build
his
feeble
trust
on
this
;
perhaps
on
his
be
young
,

have
a
frank

honest
manner

he

he

finish
speak

neither
answer
him

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
They
be
all
against
him
here
:
he
may
have
know
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
good
bye

old
Grip
,
<EOS>
good
bye

<EOS>
after
some
time
,
they
come
and
unlock
the
door
,
and
call
to
him
to
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
directly
,
and
comply
,
for
he
would
not
have
them
think
he
be
subdue
or
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
out
like
a
man
,
and
look
from
face
to
face
.
  
<EOS>
none
of
them
return
his
gaze
or
seem
to
notice
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
march
him
back
to
the
parade
by
the
way
they
have
bring
him
,
and
there
they
halt
,
among
a
body
of
soldier
,
at
least
twice
as
numerous
as
that
which
have
take
him
prisoner
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
officer
he
have
see
before
,
bade
him
in
a
few
brief
word
take
notice
that
if
he
attempt
to
escape
,
no
matter
how
favourable
a
chance
he
may
suppose
he
have
,
certain
of
the
man
have
order
to
fire
upon
him
,
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
close
round
him
as
before
,
and
march
him
off
again
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
same
unbroken
order
they
arrive
at
Bow
Street
,
follow
and
beset
on
all
side
by
a
crowd
which
be
continually
increase
.
<EOS>
here
he
be
place
before
a
blind
gentleman
,
and
ask
if
he
wish
to
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
not
he
.
 
<EOS>
what
have
he
get
to
tell
them
?
 
<EOS>
after
a
very
little
talking
,
which
he
be
careless
of
and
quite
indifferent
to
,
they
tell
him
he
be
to
go
to
Newgate
,
and
take
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
out
into
the
street
,
so
surrounded
and
hem
in
on
every
side
by
soldier
,
that
he
could
see
nothing
;
but
he
know
there
be
a
great
crowd
of
people
,
by
the
murmur
;
and
that
they
be
not
friendly
to
the
soldier
,
be
soon
render
evident
by
their
yell
and
hiss
.
 
<EOS>
how
often
and
how
eagerly
he
listen
for
the
voice
of
Hugh
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
voice
he
know
among
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
be
Hugh
a
prisoner
too
?
 
<EOS>
be
there
no
hope
!
  
<EOS>
as
they
come
nearer
and
near
to
the
prison
,
the
hooting
of
the
people
grow
more
violent
;
stone
be
throw
;
and
every
now
and
then
,
a
rush
be
make
against
the
soldier
,
which
they
stagger
under
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
close
before
him
,
smart
under
a
blow
upon
the
temple
,
level
his
musket
,
but
the
officer
strike
it
upwards
with
his
sword
,
and
order
him
on
peril
of
his
life
to
desist
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
thing
he
see
with
any
distinctness
,
for
directly
afterwards
he
be
toss
about
,
and
beat
to
and
fro
,
as
though
in
a
tempestuous
sea
.
 
<EOS>
but
go
where
he
would
,
there
be
the
same
guard
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
twice
or
thrice
he
be
throw
down
,
and
so
be
they
;
but
even
then
,
he
could
not
elude
their
vigilance
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
up
again
,
and
have
close
about
him
,
before
he
,
with
his
wrist
so
tightly
bind
,
could
scramble
to
his
foot
.
<EOS>
fence
in
,
thus
,
he
feel
himself
hoist
to
the
top
of
a
low
flight
of
step
,
and
then
for
a
moment
he
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
fighting
in
the
crowd
,
and
of
a
few
red
coat
sprinkle
together
,
here
and
there
,
struggle
to
rejoin
their
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
next
moment
,
everything
be
dark
and
gloomy
,
and
he
be
stand
in
the
prison
lobby
;
the
centre
of
a
group
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
a
smith
be
speedily
in
attendance
,
who
rivet
upon
him
a
set
of
heavy
iron
.
 
<EOS>
stumble
on
as
well
as
he
could
,
beneath
the
unusual
burden
of
these
fetter
,
he
be
conduct
to
a
strong
stone
cell
,
where
,
fasten
the
door
with
lock
,
and
bolt
,
and
chain
,
they
leave
him
,
well
secured
;
have
first
,
unseen
by
him
,
thrust
in
Grip
,
who
,
with
his
head
drooping
and
his
deep
black
plume
rough
and
rumpled
,
appear
to
comprehend
and
to
partake
,
his
master
's
fallen
fortune

Chapter
59
    
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
at
this
juncture
to
return
to
Hugh
,
who
,
have
,
as
we
have
see
,
call
to
the
rioter
to
disperse
from
about
the
Warren
,
and
meet
again
as
usual
,
glide
back
into
the
darkness
from
which
he
have
emerge
,
and
reappear
no
more
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
He
pause
in
the
copse
which
shelter
him
from
the
observation
of
his
mad
companion

and
wait
to
ascertain
whether
they
draw
off
at
his
bidding
,
or
still
linger
and
call
to
him
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
some
few
,
he
see
,
be
indispose
to
go
away
without
him
,
and
make
towards
the
spot
where
he
stand
conceal
as
though
they
be
about
to
follow
in
his
footstep
,
and
urge
him
to
come
back
;
but
these
man
,
be
in
their
turn
call
to
by
their
friend
,
and
in
truth
not
greatly
care
to
venture
into
the
dark
part
of
the
ground
,
where
they
may
be
easily
surprise
and
take
,
if
any
of
the
neighbour
or
retainer
of
the
family
be
watch
them
from
among
the
tree
,
soon
abandon
the
idea
,
and
hastily
assemble
such
man
as
they
find
of
their
mind
at
the
moment
,
straggle
off
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
satisfied
that
the
great
mass
of
the
insurgent
be
imitate
this
example
,
and
that
the
ground
be
rapidly
clear
,
he
plunge
into
the
thick
portion
of
the
little
wood
;
and
,
crash
the
branch
as
he
go
,
make
straight
towards
a
distant
light
:
guide
by
that
,
and
by
the
sullen
glow
of
the
fire
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
draw
nearer
and
near
to
the
twinkle
beacon
towards
which
he
bend
his
course
,
the
red
glare
of
a
few
torch
begin
to
reveal
itself
,
and
the
voice
of
man
speak
together
in
a
subdued
tone
break
the
silence
which
,
save
for
a
distant
shouting
now
and
then
,
already
prevail
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
clear
the
wood
,
and
,
spring
across
a
ditch
,
stand
in
a
dark
lane
,
where
a
small
body
of
ill
-
look
vagabond

leave
there
some
twenty
minute
before

his

They

those
who

on

about

to

no

anxious
for
a
second
engagement
that
night

be
already
weary
and
exhausted

they
side
with
Mr
Tappertit

and
press
him
to
make
haste
with
his
supper
,
for
they
have
already
delay
too
long

Knowing

even
in

that
they
incur
great
danger

linger
so
near
the
scene

late
outrage

Hugh
make
an
end
of
his
meal
without
more
remonstrance

and
rise
,
step
up
to
Mr

smote
him
on
the
back

now

He
thrust
the
little
man
aside
as
he
speak
,
and
mount
on
the
step
,
which
be
half
let
down
,
pull
down
the
blind
by
force

stare
into
the
chaise
like
an
ogre
into
his
larder

"

<EOS>
and
do
you
scratch
,
and
pinch
,
and
struggle
,
pretty

"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
as
he
grasp
a
little
hand
that
seek
in
vain
to
free
itself
from
his
grip
:
"
you
,
so
bright
-
eyed

cherry

lipped

daintily
make

I

<EOS>
ay
,
I
do

You
should
stab

welcome

so
that
it

you
have
to
cure
me
afterwards

I
love
to

you
proud

scornful

<EOS>
It
make
you
handsome

who
so
handsome
as
you
at
any
time

my
pretty
one

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
!
"
say
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
have
wait
during
this
speech
with
considerable
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
enough
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
come
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
little
hand
second
this
admonition
by
thrust
Hugh
's
great
head
away
with
all
its
force
,
and
draw
up
the
blind
,
amidst
his
noisy
laughter
,
and
vow
that
he
must
have
another
look
,
for
the
last
glimpse
of
that
sweet
face
have
provoke
him
past
all
bearing
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
suppress
impatience
of
the
party
now
break
out
into
open
murmur
,
he
abandon
this
design
,
and
take
his
seat
upon
the
bar
,
content
himself
with
tap
at
the
front
window
of
the
carriage
,
and
try
to
steal
a
glance
inside
;
Mr
Tappertit
,
mount
the
step
and
hang
on
by
the
door
,
issue
his
direction
to
the
driver
with
a
command
voice
and
attitude
;
the
rest
get
up
behind
,
or
run
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
,
as
they
could
;
some
,
in
imitation
of
Hugh
,
endeavour
to
see
the
face
he
have
praise
so
highly
,
and
be
remind
of
their
impertinence
by
hint
from
the
cudgel
of
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
thus
they
pursue
their
journey
by
circuitous
and
wind
road
;
preserve
,
except
when
they
halt
to
take
breath
,
or
to
quarrel
about
the
good
way
of
reach
London
,
pretty
good
order
and
tolerable
silence
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Dolly
---
beautiful
,
bewitching
,
captivate
little
dolly
---
her
hair
dishevel
,
her
dress
tear
,
<EOS>
her
dark
eyelash
wet
with
tear
,
<EOS>
her
bosom
heaving
---
<EOS>
her
face
,
now
pale
with
fear
,
now
crimson
with
indignation
---
her
whole
self
a
hundred
time
more
beautiful
in
this
heighten
aspect
than
ever
she
have
be
before
---
 
vainly
strove
to
comfort
Emma
Haredale
,
and
to
impart
to
her
the
consolation
of
which
she
stand
in
so
much
need
herself
.
 
<EOS>
the
soldier
be
sure
to
come
;
they
must
be
rescue
;
it
would
be
impossible
to
convey
them
through
the
street
of
London
when
they
set
the
threat
of
their
guard
at
defiance
,
and
shriek
to
the
passenger
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
do
this
when
they
come
into
the
more
frequented
way
,
she
be
certain
---
<EOS>
she
be
quite
certain
---
they
must
be
release
.
 
<EOS>
so
poor
Dolly
say
,
and
so
poor
Dolly
try
to
think
;
but
the
invariable
conclusion
of
all
such
argument
be
,
that
dolly
burst
into
tear
;
cry
,
as
she
wring
her
hand
,
what
would
they
do
or
think
,
or
who
would
comfort
them
,
at
home
,
at
the
Golden
Key
;
and
sob
most
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Haredale
,
whose
feeling
be
usually
of
a
quieter
kind
than
Dolly
's
,
and
not
so
much
upon
the
surface
,
be
dreadfully
alarm
,
and
indeed
have
only
just
recover
from
a
swoon
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
pale
,
and
the
hand
which
Dolly
hold
be
quite
cold
;
but
she
bid
her
,
nevertheless
,
remember
that
,
under
Providence
,
much
must
depend
upon
their
own
discretion
;
that
if
they
remain
quiet
and
lull
the
vigilance
of
the
ruffian
into
whose
hand
they
have
fall
,
the
chance
of
their
be
able
to
procure
assistance
when
they
reach
the
town
,
be
very
much
increase
;
that
unless
society
be
quite
unhinged
,
a
hot
pursuit
must
be
immediately
commence
;
and
that
her
uncle
,
she
may
be
sure
,
would
never
rest
until
he
have
find
them
out
and
rescue
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
she
say
these
latter
word
,
the
idea
that
he
have
fall
in
a
general
massacre
of
the
Catholics
that
night
---
no
very
wild
or
improbable
supposition
after
what
they
have
see
and
undergo
---
strike
her
dumb
;
and
,
lose
in
the
horror
they
have
witness
,
and
those
they
may
be
yet
reserve
for
,
she
sit
incapable
of
thought
,
or
speech
,
or
outward
show
of
grief
:
as
rigid
,
and
almost
as
white
and
cold
,
as
marble
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
how
many
,
many
time
,
in
that
long
ride
,
do
dolly
think
of
her
old
lover
,
---
poor
,
fond
,
slight
Joe
!
 
<EOS>
how
many
,
many
time
,
do
she
recall
that
night
when
she
run
into
his
arm
from
the
very
man
now
project
his
hateful
gaze
into
the
darkness
where
she
sit
,
and
leer
through
the
glass
in
monstrous
admiration
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
she
think
of
Joe
,
and
what
a
brave
fellow
he
be
,
and
how
he
would
have
ride
boldly
up
,
and
dash
in
among
these
villain
now
,
<EOS>
yes
,
though
they
be
double
the
number
---
and
here
she
clench
her
little
hand
,
and
press
her
foot
upon
the
ground
---
the
pride
she
feel
for
a
moment
in
have
win
his
heart
,
fade
in
a
burst
of
tear
,
and
she
sob
more
bitterly
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
night
wear
on
,
and
they
proceed
by
way
which
be
quite
unknown
to
them
---
for
they
could
recognise
none
of
the
object
of
which
they
sometimes
catch
a
hurried
glimpse
---
their
fear
increase
;
nor
be
they
without
good
foundation
;
it
be
not
difficult
for
two
beautiful
young
woman
to
find
,
<EOS>
in
their
being
bear
they
know
not
whither
by
a
band
of
daring
villain
who
eye
them
as
some
among
these
fellow
do
,
reason
for
the
bad
alarm
.
<EOS>
when
they
at
last
enter
London
,
by
a
suburb
with
which
they
be
wholly
unacquainted
,
it
be
past
midnight
,
and
the
street
be
dark
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
the
bad
,
for
the
carriage
stop
in
a
lonely
spot
,
Hugh
suddenly
open
the
door
,
jump
in
,
and
take
his
seat
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
they
cry
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
about
the
neck
of
each
,
and
swear
to
stifle
them
with
kiss
if
they
be
not
as
silent
as
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"

They

at

with

so
dark
(

that
this
be
mere
conjecture

<EOS>
They
shrink
from
his
touch
,
each
into
the
farth
corner
of
the
carriage
;
but
shrink
as
Dolly
would
,
his
arm
encircle
her
waist
,
and
hold
her
fast
.
 
<EOS>
She
neither
cry
nor
speak

for
terror
and
disgust
deprive
her
of
the
power

she
pluck
at
his
hand
as

she
would
die
in
the
effort
to
disengage
herself
;

crouch
on
the
ground

with
her
head
avert

hold
down

repel
him

strength
she
wonder
at
as
much

borne
after

after

gently
down

slightly
part

to
give

breathing
vent

who
could

when

her
heart
would
break

bemoan
her
misery
in
the
sweetest
voice

ever

pettishness

itself

in

her
cheek

eye

hair

Dennis

cock
his
hat
for
the
convenience
of
scratch
his
head
,
and
look
gravely
at
Hugh
<EOS>
,
"
it
be
worthy
of
notice

as
a
proof

amazing
equalness

dignity

do
not
make
no
distinction
between
man

I
have
heerd
the

up

he
have
no

to
pursue

at
this
crisis

precipitately

Simon

unable
any

to
suppress
her
secret
passion

be
about
to
give
it
full
vent
in
its
intensity

and
to
declare
that

look
extremely
foolish

she
say
these
word

the
more
so
,
as
they
be
receive
by
Hugh

Dennis
with
a
loud

draw
back

advance
towards

Dolly
retreat
till
she
could
go
no

then
sink
down
upon

floor

think
it
very
possible
that

may

maiden

Simon
essay
to
raise
her
;
on
which
Dolly
,
goad
to
desperation
,
wound
her
hand
in

cry
out

her
tear

always

be

shake

and
pull

and
beat
him

be
fain
to
call
for
help

most
lustily

Hugh
have
never
admire
her
half
so
much

at

"
She
be
in

night

smooth
his

off

let
her
be
by
herself

that
will
bring
her
down
a

<EOS>
carry
her
into
the
next
house

<EOS>
Hugh
have
her
in
his
arm
directly
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
Mr
Tappertit
's
heart
be
really
soften
by
her
distress
,
or
it
may
be
that
he
feel
it
in
some
degree
indecorous
that
his
intend
bride
should
be
struggle
in
the
grasp
of
another
man

<EOS>
He
command
him
,
on
second
thought
,
to
put
her
down
again
,
and
look
moodily
on
as
she
fly
to
Miss
Haredale

side
,
and
cling
to
her
dress
,
hide
her
flushed
face
in
its
fold

"

rejoin

as

speak

clap
his

upon

shoulder
of

little
man

he
laugh
again

for

unknown
reason

with
tenfold
violence

Mr

survey
him
from
head
to
foot
with
lofty
scorn
(
this
only
make
him
laugh
the
more
)

and
turn
to
the
prisoner
,
say
:

do
not
show
yourselves
at

appeal
to

may
see
pass
it

for
if
you
do

it
will
be
know
directly

turn

by

pause
for
a
moment

go
out

to
look
at

clasped
in

arm

then
leave
the
cottage
;
fasten
the
door

set
a
good
watch

indeed
all
round

Hugh
look
,
for

Chapter
60
    
<EOS>
the
three
worthy
turn
their
face
towards
the
Boot
,
with
the
intention
of
pass
the
night
in
that
place
of
rendezvous
,
and
of
seek
the
repose
they
so
much
need
in
the
shelter
of
their
old
den
;
for
now
that
the
mischief
and
destruction
they
have
purpose
be
achieve
,
and
their
prisoner
be
safely
bestow
for
the
night
,
they
begin
to
be
conscious
of
exhaustion
,
and
to
feel
the
waste
effect
of
the
madness
which
have
lead
to
such
deplorable
result
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
lassitude
and
fatigue
which
oppress
him
now
,
in
common
with
his
two
companion
,
and
indeed
with
all
who
have
take
an
active
share
in
that
night
's
work
,
Hugh
's
boisterous
merriment
break
out
afresh
whenever
he
look
at
Simon
Tappertit
,
and
vent
itself
---
much
to
that
gentleman
's
indignation
---
in
such
shout
of
laughter
as
bade
fair
to
bring
the
watch
upon
them
,
and
involve
them
in
a
skirmish
,
to
which
in
their
present
wear
-
out
condition
they
may
prove
by
no
means
equal
.
 
<EOS>
even
Mr
Dennis
,
who
be
not
at
all
particular
on
the
score
of
gravity
or
dignity
,
and
who
have
a
great
relish
for
his
young
friend
's
eccentric
humour
,
take
occasion
to
remonstrate
with
him
on
this
imprudent
behaviour
,
which
he
hold
to
be
a
species
of
suicide
,
tantamount
to
a
man
's
work
himself
off
without
be
overtake
by
the
law
,
than
which
he
could
imagine
nothing
more
ridiculous
or
impertinent
.
  
<EOS>
not
abate
one
jot
of
his
noisy
mirth
for
these
remonstrance
,
Hugh
reel
along
between
them
,
have
an
arm
of
each
,
until
they
hove
in
sight
of
the
Boot
,
and
be
within
a
field
or
two
of
that
convenient
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
He
happen
by
great
good
luck
to
have
roar
and
shout
himself
into
silence
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
proceed
onward
without
noise
,
when
a
scout
who
have
be
creep
about
the
ditch
all
night
,
to
warn
any
straggler
from
encroach
further
on
what
be
now
such
dangerous
ground
,
peep
cautiously
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
call
to
them
to
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
!
<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
"
say
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
because
(
the
scout
reply
)
<EOS>
the
house
be
fill
with
constable
and
soldier
;
have
be
surprise
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
the
inmate
have
flee
or
be
take
into
custody
,
he
could
not
say
which
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
prevent
a
great
many
people
from
approach
nearer
,
and
he
believe
they
have
go
to
the
market
and
such
place
to
pass
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
see
the
distant
fire
,
but
they
be
all
out
now
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
the
people
who
pass
and
repasse
,
speak
of
them
too
,
and
could
report
that
the
prevail
opinion
be
one
of
apprehension
and
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
hear
a
word
of
Barnaby
---
 
<EOS>
do
not
even
know
his
name
---
but
it
have
be
say
in
his
hearing
that
some
man
have
be
take
and
carry
off
to
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
whether
this
be
true
or
false
,
he
could
not
affirm
.
  
<EOS>
the
three
take
counsel
together
,
on
hear
this
,
and
debate
what
it
may
be
good
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
,
deem
it
possible
that
Barnaby
be
in
the
hand
of
the
soldier
,
and
at
that
moment
under
detention
at
the
Boot
,
be
for
advance
stealthily
,
and
fire
the
house
;
but
his
companion
,
who
object
to
such
rash
measure
unless
they
have
a
crowd
at
their
back
,
represent
that
if
Barnaby
be
take
he
have
assuredly
be
remove
to
a
strong
prison
;
they
would
never
have
dream
of
keep
him
all
night
in
a
place
so
weak
and
open
to
attack
.
 
<EOS>
yield
to
this
reasoning
,
and
to
their
persuasion
,
Hugh
consent
to
turn
back
and
to
repair
to
Fleet
Market
;
for
which
place
,
it
seem
,
a
few
of
their
bold
associate
have
shape
their
course
,
on
receive
the
same
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
feel
their
strength
recruit
and
their
spirit
rouse
,
now
that
there
be
a
new
necessity
for
action
,
they
hurry
away
,
quite
forgetful
of
the
fatigue
under
which
they
have
be
sink
but
a
few
minute
before
;
and
soon
arrive
at
their
new
place
of
destination
.
  
<EOS>
Fleet
Market
,
at
that
time
,
be
a
long
irregular
row
of
wooden
shed
and
penthouse
,
occupy
the
centre
of
what
be
now
call
Farringdon
Street
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
jumble
together
in
a
most
unsightly
fashion
,
in
the
middle
of
the
road
;
to
the
great
obstruction
of
the
thoroughfare
and
the
annoyance
of
passenger
,
who
be
fain
to
make
their
way
,
as
they
best
could
,
among
cart
,
basket
,
barrow
,
truck
,
cask
,
bulk
,
and
bench
,
and
to
jostle
with
porter
,
huckster
,
waggoner
,
and
a
motley
crowd
of
buyer
,
seller
,
pick
-
pocket
,
vagrant
,
and
idler
.
 
<EOS>
the
air
be
perfume
with
the
stench
of
rotten
leave
and
fade
fruit
;
the
refuse
of
the
butcher
'
stall
,
and
offal
and
garbage
of
a
hundred
kind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
indispensable
to
most
public
convenience
in
those
day
,
that
they
should
be
public
nuisance
likewise
;
and
Fleet
Market
maintain
the
principle
to
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
place
,
perhaps
because
its
shed
and
basket
be
a
tolerable
substitute
for
bed
,
or
perhaps
because
it
afford
the
mean
of
a
hasty
barricade
in
case
of
need
,
many
of
the
rioter
have
straggle
,
not
only
that
night
,
but
for
two
or
three
night
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
broad
day
,
but
the
morning
be
cold
,
a
group
of
them
be
gather
round
a
fire
in
a
public
-
house
,
drink
hot
purl
,
and
smoking
pipe
,
and
plan
new
scheme
for
to

<EOS>
Hugh

to
most
of
these

,
be
receive
with
signal
mark
of
approbation
,
and
induct
into
the
most
honourable
seat
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
-
door
be
close
and
fasten
to
keep
intruder
at
a
distance
,
and
then
they
proceed
to
exchange
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
the

take
possession
of
the
Boot
,
I
hear
,
"
say
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
know
anything
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Several
cry
that
they
do
;
but
the
majority
of
the
company
have
be
engage
in
the
assault
upon
the
Warren
,
and
all
present
have
be
concern
in
one
or
other
of
the
night
's
expedition
,
it
prove
that
they
know
no
more
than
Hugh
himself
;
have
be
merely
warn
by
each
other
,
or
by
the
scout
,
and
know
nothing
of
their
own
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
leave
a
man
on
guard
there
to

day

Hugh

look
round
him

Barnaby

at
Westminster

<EOS>
have
any
man
see
or
hear
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
shake
their
head
,
and
murmur
an
answer
in
the
negative
,
as
each
man
look
round
and
appeal
to
his
fellow
;
when
a
noise
be
hear
without

and
a
man
be

to
say
that
he
want
Hugh

that
he
must
see
Hugh

<EOS>
"
He

He

so

again
face
sharply
towards
Hugh

grasp
his

as

<EOS>
Oaths

<EOS>
some
cry
that
if
they
bear
this
tamely
,
another
day
would
see
them
all
in
jail
;
some
,
that
they

assistance
of
the
sexton
,
and

to
mount
his
horse
,
conduct
him
to
Chigwell
;
bent
upon
procure
a
conveyance
to
London
from
that
place
,
and
carry
him
at
once
before
a
justice
.
 
<EOS>
the
disturbed
state
of
the
town
would
be
,
he
know
,
a
sufficient
reason
for
demand
the
murderer
's
committal
to
prison
before
daybreak
,
as
no
man
could
answer
for
the
security
of
any
of
the
watch
-
house
or
ordinary
place
of
detention
;
and
to
convey
a
prisoner
through
the
street
when
the
mob
be
again
abroad
,
would
not
only
be
a
task
of
great
danger
and
hazard
,
but
would
be
to
challenge
an
attempt
at
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
direct
the
sexton
to
lead
the
horse
,
he
walk
close
by
the
murderer
's
side
,
and
in
this
order
they
reach
the
village
about
the
middle
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
be
all
awake
and
up
,
for
they
be
fearful
of
be
burn
in
their
bed
,
and
seek
to
comfort
and
assure
each
other
by
watch
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
of
the
stoutest
-
hearted
be
arm
and
gather
in
a
body
on
the
green
.
 
<EOS>
to
these
,
who
know
him
well
,
Mr
Haredale
address
himself
,
briefly
narrate
what
have
happen
,
and
beseech
them
to
aid
in
convey
the
criminal
to
London
before
the
dawn
of
day
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
a
man
among
them
dare
to
help
him
by
so
much
as
the
motion
of
a
finger
.
 
<EOS>
the
rioter
,
in
their
passage
through
the
village
,
have
menace
with
their
fierce
vengeance
,
any
person
who
should
aid
in
extinguish
the
fire
,
or
render
the
least
assistance
to
him
,
or
any
catholic
whomsoever
.
 
<EOS>
Their
threat
extend
to
their
life
and
all
they
possess
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
assemble
for
their
own
protection
,
and
could
not
endanger
themselves
by
lend
any
aid
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
they
tell
him
,
not
without
hesitation
and
regret
,
as
they
keep
aloof
in
the
moonlight
and
glance
fearfully
at
the
ghostly
rider
,
who
,
with
his
head
droop
on
his
breast
and
his
hat
slouch
down
upon
his
brow
,
neither
move
nor
speak
.
  
<EOS>
find
it
impossible
to
persuade
them
,
and
indeed
hardly
know
how
to
do
so
after
what
they
have
see
of
the
fury
of
the
crowd
,
Mr
Haredale
beseech
them
that
at
least
they
would
leave
him
free
to
act
for
himself
,
and
would
suffer
him
to
take
the
only
chaise
and
pair
of
horse
that
the
place
afford
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
accede
to
without
some
difficulty
,
but
in
the
end
they
tell
him
to
do
what
he
would
,
and
go
away
from
them
in
heaven
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
leave
the
sexton
at
the
horse
's
bridle
,
he
draw
out
the
chaise
with
his
own
hand
,
and
would
have
harness
the
horse
,
but
that
the
post
-
boy
of
the
village
---
a
soft
-
hearted
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
,
vagabond
kind
of
fellow
---
be
move
by
his
earnestness
and
passion
,
and
,
throw
down
a
pitchfork
with
which
he
be
armed
,
swear
that
the
rioter
may
cut
him
into
mincemeat
if
they
like
,
but
he
would
not
stand
by
and
see
an
honest
gentleman
who
have
do
no
wrong
,
reduce
to
such
extremity
,
without
do
what
he
could
to
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
shake
him
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
thank
him
from
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
in
five
minute
'
time
the
chaise
be
ready
,
and
this
good
scapegrace
in
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
the
murderer
be
put
inside
,
the
blind
be
draw
up
,
the
sexton
take
his
seat
upon
the
bar
,
Mr
Haredale
mount
his
horse
and
ride
close
beside
the
door
;
and
so
they
start
in
the
dead
of
night
,
and
in
profound
silence
,
for
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
consternation
be
so
extreme
that
even
the
horse
which
have
escape
the
flame
at
the
Warren
,
could
find
no
friend
to
shelter
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
pass
them
on
the
road
,
browse
on
the
stunted
grass
;
and
the
driver
tell
them
,
that
the
poor
beast
have
wander
to
the
village
first
,
but
have
be
drive
away
,
lest
they
should
bring
the
vengeance
of
the
crowd
on
any
of
the
inhabitant
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
this
feeling
confine
to
such
small
place
,
where
the
people
be
timid
,
ignorant
,
and
unprotected
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
come
near
London
they
meet
,
in
the
grey
light
of
morning
,
more
than
one
poor
catholic
family
who
,
terrify
by
the
threat
and
warning
of
their
neighbour
,
be
quit
the
city
on
foot
,
and
who
tell
them
they
could
hire
no
cart
or
horse
for
the
removal
of
their
good
,
and
have
be
compel
to
leave
them
behind
,
at
the
mercy
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
Near
Mile
End
they
pass
a
house
,
the
master
of
which
<EOS>
,
a
catholic
gentleman
of
small
mean
,
have
hire
a
waggon
to
remove
his
furniture
by
midnight
,
have
have
it
all
bring
down
into
the
street
,
to
wait
the
vehicle
's
arrival
,
and
save
time
in
the
packing
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
man
with
whom
he
make
the
bargain
,
alarm
by
the
fire
that
night
,
and
by
the
sight
of
the
rioter
pass
his
door
,
have
refuse
to
keep
it
:
and
the
poor
gentleman
,
with
his
wife
and
servant
and
their
little
child
,
be
sit
tremble
among
their
good
in
the
open
street
,
dread
the
arrival
of
day
and
not
know
where
to
turn
or
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
,
they
hear
,
with
the
public
conveyance
.
 
<EOS>
the
panic
be
so
great
that
the
mail
and
stage
-
coach
be
afraid
to
carry
passenger
who
profess
the
obnoxious
religion
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
driver
know
them
,
or
they
admit
that
they
hold
that
creed
,
they
would
not
take
them
,
no
,
though
they
offer
large
sum
;
and
yesterday
,
people
have
be
afraid
to
recognise
catholic
acquaintance
in
the
street
,
lest
they
should
be
mark
by
spy

and
burn
out
,
as

Mr

bow

off

close
beside
the
chaise
as
before

determine
to
repair
to
the
house
of
Sir
John
Fielding
,
who
have
the
reputation
of
be
a
bold
and
active
magistrate
,
and
fully
resolve
,
<EOS>
in
case
the
rioter
should
come
upon
them
,
to
do
execution
on
the
murderer
with
his
own
hand
,
rather
than
suffer
him
to
be
release
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrive
at
the
magistrate
's
dwelling
,
however
,
without
molestation
(
for
the
mob
,
as
we
have
see
,
be
then
intent
on
deep
scheme
)
,
and
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
have
be
pretty
generally
rumour
that
Sir
John
be
proscribe
by
the
rioter
,
a
body
of
thief
-
taker
have
be
keep
watch
in
the
house
all
night
.
<EOS>
to
one
of
them
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
state
his
business
,
which
appear
to
the
man
of
sufficient
moment
to
warrant
his
arouse
the
justice
,
procure
him
an
immediate
audience
.
  
<EOS>
no
time
be
lose
in
commit
the
murderer
to
Newgate
;
then
a
new
building
,
recently
complete
at
a
vast
expense
,
and
consider
to
be
of
enormous
strength
.
 
<EOS>
the
warrant
be
make
out
,
three
of
the
thief
-
taker
bind
him
afresh
(
he
have
be
struggle
,
it
seem
,
in
the
chaise
,
and
have
loosen
his
manacle
)
;
gag
him
lest
they
should
meet
with
any
of
the
mob
,
and
he
should
call
to
them
for
help
;
and
seat
themselves
,
along
with
him
,
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
these
man
be
all
well
armed
,
make
a
formidable
escort
;
but
they
draw
up
the
blind
again
,
as
though
the
carriage
be
empty
,
and
direct
Mr
Haredale
to
ride
forward
,
that
he
may
not
attract
attention
by
seem
to
belong
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
wisdom
of
this
proceeding
be
sufficiently
obvious
,
for
as
they
hurry
through
the
city
they
pass
among
several
group
of
man
,
who
,
if
they
have
not
suppose
the
chaise
to
be
quite
empty
,
would
certainly
have
stop
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
those
within
keep
quite
close
,
and
the
driver
tarry
to
be
ask
no
question
,
they
reach
the
prison
without
interruption
,
and
,
once
there
,
have
him
out
,
and
safe
within
its
gloomy
wall
,
in
a
twinkling
.
  
<EOS>
with
eager
eye
and
strained
attention
,
Mr
Haredale
see
him
chain
,
and
lock
and
bar
up
in
his
cell
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
when
he
have
leave
the
jail
,
and
stand
in
the
free
street
,
without
,
he
feel
the
iron
plate
upon
the
door
,
with
his
hand
,
and
draw
them
over
the
stone
wall
,
to
assure
himself
that
it
be
real
;
and
to
exult
in
its
being
so
strong
,
and
rough
,
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
he
turn
his
back
upon
the
jail
,
and
glance
along
the
empty
street
,
so
lifeless
and
quiet
in
the
bright
morning
,
that
he
feel
the
weight
upon
his
heart
;
that
he
know
he
be
torture
by
anxiety
for
those
he
have
leave
at
home
;
and
that
home
itself
be
but
another
bead
in
the
long
rosary
of
his
regret
.

subside
strangely
into
one
another

awaken
an
indescribable
kind
of
interest

amusement

engross
his
whole

although
at
the
bottom
of
his
every

there
be
an
uneasy
sense

guilt

vague
consciousness

of

It
pursue

through

at

make

unhappy

and
yet
be

a
phantom
without

him
to

porch

door

cell

set
it
wide
open

inform
its
inmate

liberty

walk
in

adjacent
yard

if
he
think
proper

for
an
hour

<EOS>

prisoner
answer
with
a
sullen
nod
;
and
be
leave
alone
again
,
sit
brood
over
what
he
have
hear
,
and
ponder
upon
the
hope
the
recent
conversation
have
awaken
;
gaze
abstractedly
,
the
while
he
do
so
,
on
the
light
without
,
and
watch
the
shadow
throw
by
one
wall
on
another
,
and
on
the
stone
-
pave
ground
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
dull
,
square
yard
,
make
cold
and
gloomy
by
high
wall
,
and
seem
to
chill
the
very
sunlight
.
 
<EOS>
the
stone
,
so
bare
,
and
rough
,
and
obdurate
,
fill
even
him
with
long
thought
of
meadow
-
land
and
tree
;
and
with
a
burn
wish
to
be
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
,
he
rise
,
and
lean
against
the
door
-
post
,
gaze
up
at
the
bright
blue
sky
,
smile
even
on
that
dreary
home
of
crime
.
<EOS>
He
seem
,
for
a
moment
,
to
remember
lie
on
his
back
in
some
sweet
-
scented
place
,
and
gaze
at
it
through
move
branch
,
long
ago
.
  
<EOS>
His
attention
be
suddenly
attract
by
a
clanking
sound
---
he
know
what
it
be
,
for
he
have
startle
himself
by
make
the
same
noise
in
walk
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
presently
a
voice
begin
to
sing
,
and
he
see
the
shadow
of
a
figure
on
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
It
stop
---
be
silent
all
at
once
,
as
though
the
person
for
a
moment
have
forget
where
he
be
,
but
soon
remember
---
and
<EOS>
so
,
with
the
same
clanking
noise
,
the
shadow
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
He
walk
out
into
the
court
and
pace
it
to
and
fro
;
startle
the
echo
,
as
he
go
,
with
the
harsh
jangling
of
his
fetter
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
door
near
his
,
which
,
like
his
,
stand
ajar
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
take
half
-
a
-
dozen
turn
up
and
down
the
yard
,
when
,
stand
still
to
observe
this
door
,
he
hear
the
clanking
sound
again
.
 
<EOS>
a
face
look
out
of
the
grate
window
---
he
see
it
very
dimly
,
for
the
cell
be
dark
and
the
bar
be
heavy
---
and
directly
afterwards
,
a
man
appear
,
and
come
towards

much
notice
of
these
outpouring
of
Miss

after
she
have
make
her
first
announcement
in

notwithstanding

defenceless

overflow
the

They
be
very
wrathful
with
him
(
for

even
call
out
to
those
in

to
bring
him
forth

Mr
Dennis
be
so
affect
by
this
constancy
on
the
part
of
the
staunch
old
man
,
that
he
protest
---
almost
with
tear
in
his
eye
---
 
that
to
baulk
his
inclination
would
be
an
act
of
cruelty
and
hard
deal
to
which
he
,
for
one
,
never
could
reconcile
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
he
say
,
have
avow
in
so
many
word
that
he
be
ready
for
work
off

such
be
the
case
,
he
consider
it
their
duty
,
as
a
civilised
and
enlighten
crowd
,
to
work
him
off

<EOS>
It
be
not
often

he
observe
,
that
they
have
it
in
their
power
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
wish
of
those
from
whom
they
have
the
misfortune
to
differ
.
 
<EOS>
have
now
find
an
individual
who
express
a
desire
which
they
could
reasonably
indulge
(
and
for
himself
he
be
free
to
confess
that
in
his
opinion
that
desire
do
honour
to
his
feeling
)
,
he
hope
they
would
decide
to
accede
to
his
proposition
before
go
any
further

<EOS>
It
be
an
experiment
which

skilfully

dexterously
perform
,
would
be
over
in
five
minute

with
great
comfort

satisfaction
to

though
it
do
not
become
him
(
Mr

)
to
speak
well
of
himself
<EOS>
he
trust
he
may
be
allow
to
say
that
he
have
practical
knowledge
of
the
subject
,
and
,
be
naturally
of
an
obliging

friendly

would
work

off

these

in

a
frightful
din

turmoil
to
those
immediately
about
him
,
be
receive
with
great
favour
;
not
so
much
,
perhaps
,
because
of
the
hangman

eloquence

obstinacy

Gabriel

he
preserve

confusion
on

directly
he
be
silent

that
the

no

with
a
start

towards
the
place
from

hurriedly
at

<EOS>
this
incautious
speech
by
no

to
appease
the
ferocity
of
the
crowd

<EOS>
They
cry
again
to
have
him
bring
out

it
would
have
go
hard
with

honest

They
look
at

swarm
over

accord
to

for

smoke
hot

<EOS>
the
cry
run
through
the
mob

<EOS>
Hammers
begin
to
rattle
on
the
wall
;
and
every
man
strove
to
reach
the
prison
,
and
be
among
the
foremost
rank
.
 
<EOS>
fight
their
way
through
the
press
and
struggle
,
as
desperately
as
if
they
be
in
the
midst
of
enemy
rather
than
their
own
friend
,
the
two
man
retreat
with
the
locksmith
between
them
,
and
drag
him
through
the
very
heart
of
the
concourse
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
stroke
begin
to
fall
like
hail
upon
the
gate
,
and
on
the
strong
building
;
for
those
who
could
not
reach
the
door
,
spend
their
fierce
rage
on
anything
---
even
on
the
great
block
of
stone
,
which
shiver
their
weapon
into
fragment
,
and
make
their
hand
and
arm
to
tingle
as
if
the
wall
be
active
in
their
stout
resistance
,
and
deal
them
back
their
blow
.
 
<EOS>
the
clash
of
iron
ringing
upon
iron
,
mingle
with
the
deafen
tumult
and
sound
high
above
it
,
as
the
great
sledge
-
hammers
rattle
on
the
nail
and
plate
door
<EOS>
:
the
sparks
fly
off
in
shower
;
man
work
in
gang
,
and
at
short
interval
relieve
each
other
,
that
all
their
strength
may
be
devote
to
the
work
;
but
there
stand
the
portal
still
,
as
grim
and
dark
and
strong
as
ever
,
and
,
save
for
the
dint
upon
its
battered
surface
,
quite
unchanged
.
  
<EOS>
while
some
bring
all
their
energy
to
bear
upon
this
toilsome
task
;
and
some
,
rear
ladder
against
the
prison
,
try
to
clamber
to
the
summit
of
the
wall
they
be
too
short
to
scale
;
and
some
again
engage
a
body
of
police
a
hundred
strong
,
and
beat
them
back
and
tread
them
under
foot
by
force
of
number
;
other
besiege
the
house
on
which
the
jailer
have
appear
,
and
drive
in
the
door
,
bring
out
his
furniture
,
and
pile
it
up
against
the
prison
-
gate
,
to
make
a
bonfire
which
should
burn
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
this
device
be
understand
,
all
those
who
have
labour
hitherto
,
cast
down
their
tool
and
help
to
swell
the
heap
;
which
reach
half
-
way
across
the
street
,
and
be
so
high
,
that
those
who
throw
more
fuel
on
the
top

get
up
by
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
when
all
the
keeper
's
good
be
fling
upon
this
costly
pile
,
to
the
last
fragment

they
smear
it
with
the
pitch
,
and
tar
,
and
rosin
they
have
bring
,
and
sprinkle
it
with
turpentine
.
 
<EOS>
to
all
the
woodwork
round
the
prison
-
door
<EOS>
they
do
the
like
,
leave
not
a
joist
or
beam
untouched
.
 
<EOS>
this
infernal
christening
perform
,
they
fire
the
pile
with
light
match
and
with
blaze
tow
,
and
then
stand
by
,
await
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
the
furniture
be
very
dry
,
and
render
more
combustible
by
wax
and
oil
,
besides
the
art
they
have
use
,
take
fire
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
the
flame
roar
high
and
fiercely
,
blacken
the
prison
-
wall
,
and
twine
up
its
loftly
front
like
burn
serpent
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
they
crowd
round
the
blaze
,
and
vent
their
exultation
only
in
their
look
:
but
when
it
grow
hot
and
fiercer
---
when
it
crackle
,
leap
,
and
roar
,
like
a
great
furnace
---
when
it
shine
upon
the
opposite
house
,
and
light
up
not
only
the
pale
and
wonder
face
at
the
window
,
but
the
inmost
corner
of
each
habitation
---
 
when
through
the
deep
red
heat
and
glow
,
the
fire
be
see
sport
and
toy
with
the
door
,
now
cling
to
its
obdurate
surface
,
now
glide
off
with
fierce
inconstancy
and
soar
high
into
the
sky
,
anon
return
to
fold
it
in
its
burn
grasp
and
lure
it
to
its
ruin
---
when
it
shine
and
gleam
so
brightly
that
the
church
clock
of
St
Sepulchre
's
so
often
point
to
the
hour
of
death
,
be
legible
as
in
broad
day
,
and
the
vane
upon
its
steeple
-
top
glitter
in
the
unwonted
light
like
something
richly
jewel
---
 
when
blacken
stone
and
sombre
brick
grow
ruddy
in
the
deep
reflection
,
and
window
shine
like
burnished
gold
,
dot
the
long
distance
in
the
fiery
vista
with
their
speck
of
brightness
---
when
wall
and
tower
,
and
roof
and
chimney
-
stack
,
seem
drunk
,
and
in
the
flicker
glare
appear
to
reel
and
stagger
---
 
<EOS>
when
score
of
object
,
never
see
before
,
burst
out
upon
the
view
,
and
thing
the
most
familiar
put
on
some
new
aspect

then
the
mob
begin
to
join
the
whirl
,
and
with
loud
yell
,
and
shout
,
and
clamour
,
such
as
happily
be
seldom
hear
,
bestir
themselves
to
feed
the
fire
,
and
keep
it
at
its
height
.
  
<EOS>
although
the
heat
be
so
intense
that
the
paint
on
the
house
over
against
the
prison
,
parch
and
crackle
up
,
and
swell
into
boil
,
as
it
be
from
excess
of
torture
,
break
and
crumble
away
;
although
the
glass
fall
from
the
window

sash
,
and
the
lead
and
iron
on
the
roof
blister
the
incautious
hand
that
touch
them
,
and
the
sparrow
in
the
eave
take
wing
,
and
render
giddy
by
the
smoke
,
fall
flutter
down
upon
the

tend
unceasingly
by
busy

<EOS>
They
never
slacken
in
their
zeal
,
or
keep
aloof
,
but
press
upon
the
flame
so
hard
,
that
those
in

have
much
ado
to
save
themselves
from
be
thrust
in
;
if
one
man
swoon
or
drop
,
a
dozen
struggle
for
his
place
,
and
that
although
they
know
the
pain

thirst
,
and
pressure
to
be
unendurable

those
who

an

yard
close

with
water
from
a
pump
;
of
which
bucket
full
be
pass
from

but
such
be
the
strong
desire

above
the
people
's
head
to
such
as
stand
about
the
ladder
,
and
some
of
these
,
climb
up
to
the
topmost
stave
,
and
hold
on
with
one
hand
by
the
prison
wall
,
exert
all
their
skill
and
force
to
cast
these
fire
-
brand
on
the
roof
,
or
down
into
the
yard
within
.
 
<EOS>
in
many
instance
their
effort
be
successful
;
which
occasion
a
new
and
appalling
addition
to
the
horror
of
the
scene
:
for
the
prisoner
within
,
see
from
between
their
bar
that
the
fire
catch
in
many
place
and
thrive
fiercely
,
and
be
all
lock
up
in
strong
cell
for
the
night
,
begin
to
know
that
they
be
in
danger
of
be
burn
alive
.
 
<EOS>
this
terrible
fear
,
spread
from
cell
to
cell
and
from
yard
to
yard
,
vent
itself
in
such
dismal
cry
and
wailing
,
and
in
such
dreadful
shriek
for
help
,
that
the
whole
jail
resound
with
the
noise
;
which
be
loudly
hear
even
above
the
shouting
of
the
mob
and
roaring
of
the
flame
,
and
be
so
full
of
agony
and
despair
,
that
it
make
the
bold
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
that
these
cry
begin
in
that
quarter
of
the
jail
which
front
Newgate
Street
,
where
,
it
be
well
know
,
the
man
who
be
to
suffer
death
on
Thursday
be
confine
.
 
<EOS>
and
not
only
be
these
four
who
have
so
short
a
time
to
live
,
the
first
to
whom
the
dread
of
be
burn
occur
,
but
they
be
,
throughout
,
the
most
importunate
of
all
:
for
they
could
be
plainly
hear
,
notwithstanding
the
great
thickness
of
the
wall
,
cry
that
the
wind
set
that
way
,
and
that
the
flame
would
shortly
reach
them
;
and
call
to
the
officer
of
the
jail
to
come
and
quench
the
fire
from
a
cistern
which
be
in
their
yard
,
and
full
of
water
.
<EOS>
judge
from
what
the
crowd
outside
the
wall
could
hear
from
time
to
time
,
these
four
doom
wretch
never
cease
to
call
for
help
;
and
that
with
as
much
distraction
,
and
in
as
great
a
frenzy
of
attachment
to
existence
,
as
though
each
have
an
honoured
,
happy
life
before
him
,
instead
of
eight
-
and
-
forty
hour
of
miserable
imprisonment
,
and
then
a
violent
and
shameful
death
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
anguish
and
suffering
of
the
two
son
of
one
of
these
man
,
when
they
hear
,
or
fancy
that
they
hear
,
their
father
's
voice
,
be
past
description
.
 
<EOS>
after
wring
their
hand
and
rush
to
and
fro
as
if
they
be
stark
mad
,
one
mount
on
the
shoulder
of
his
brother
,
and
try
to
clamber
up
the
face
of
the
high
wall
,
guard
at
the
top
with
spike
and
point
of
iron
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
fall
among
the
crowd
,
he
be
not
deter
by
his
bruise
,
but
mount
up
again
,
and
fall
again
,
and
,
when
he
find
the
feat
impossible
,
begin
to
beat
the
stone
and
tear
them
with
his
hand
,
as
if
he
could
that
way
make
a
breach
in
the
strong
building
,
and
force
a
passage
in
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
they
cleave
their
way
among
the
mob
about
the
door
,
though
many
man
,
a
dozen
time
their
match
,
have
try
in
vain
to
do
so
,
and
be
see
,
in
---
yes
,
in
---
the
fire
,
strive
to
prize
it
down
,
with
crowbar
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
they
alone
affect
by
the
outcry
from
within
the
prison
.
<EOS>
the
woman
who
be
look
on
,
shriek
loudly
,
beat
their
hand
together
,
stop
their
ear
;
and
many
faint
:
the
man
who
be
not
near
the
wall
and
active
in
the
siege
,
rather
than
do
nothing
,
tear
up
the
pavement
of
the
street
,
and
do
so
with
a
haste
and
fury
they
could
not
have
surpass
if
that
have
be
the
jail
,
and
they
be
near
their
object
.
 
<EOS>
not
one
live
creature
in
the
throng
be
for
an
instant
still
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
great
mass
be
mad
.
  
<EOS>
a
shout
!
 
<EOS>
another
!
 
<EOS>
another
yet
,
though
few
know
why
,
or
what
it
mean
.
 
<EOS>
but
those
around
the
gate
have
see
it
slowly
yield
,
and
drop
from
its
topmost
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
It
hang
on
that
side
by
but
one
,
but
it
be
upright
still
,
because
of
the
bar
,
and
its
have
sink
,
of
its
own
weight
,
into
the
heap
of
ashe
at
its
foot
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
now
a
gap
at
the
top
of
the
doorway
,
through
which

descry
a
gloomy
passage

cavernous
and
dark

<EOS>
It
burn
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
red
-
hot
,
and
the
gap
wider
.
 
<EOS>
They
vainly
try
to
shield
their
face
with
their
hand
,
and
stand
as
if
in
readiness
for
a
spring
,
watch
the
place
.

dark
figure
,
some
crawling
on
their

some
carry

be

to
pass
along
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
the

could
hold
out
no

.
 
<EOS>
the
keeper
,
and
his

pile
up
the

the

sink
down
again
:
it

deeper
in
the
cinder

yield
---
be
down

<EOS>
as
they
shout
again
,
they
fall
back
,
for
a
moment
,
and
leave
a
clear
space
about
the
fire
that
lie
between
them
and
the
jail
entry
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
leapt
upon
the
blaze
heap
,
and
scatter
a
train
of
spark
into
the
air
,
and
make
the
dark
lobby
glitter
with
those
that
hang
upon
his
dress
,
dash
into
the
jail
.
  
<EOS>
the
hangman
follow
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
so
many
rush
upon
their
track
,
that
the
fire
get
trodden
down
and
thinly
strew
about
the
street
;
but
there
be
no

of
it
now
,
for

the

Chapter
65
    
<EOS>
during
the
whole
course
of
the
terrible
scene
which
be
now
at
its
height
,
one
man
in
the
jail
suffer
a
degree
of
fear
and
mental
torment
which
have
no
parallel
in
the
endurance
,
even
of
those
who
lay
under
sentence
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
rioter
first
assemble
before
the
building
,
the
murderer
be
rouse
from
sleep
---
if
such
slumber
as
his
may
have
that
bless
name
---
by
the
roar
of
voice
,
and
the
struggling
of
a
great
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
up
as
these
sound
meet
his
ear
,
and
,
sit
on
his
bedstead
,
listen
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
interval
of
silence
the
noise
burst
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
still
listen
attentively
,
he
make
out
,
in
course
of
time
,
that
the
jail
be
besiege
by
a
furious
multitude
.
 
<EOS>
His
guilty
conscience
instantly
array
these
man
against
himself
,
and
bring
the
fear
upon
him
that
he
would
be
single
out
,
and
tear
to
piece
.
  
<EOS>
once
impress
with
the
terror
of
this
conceit
,
everything
tend
to
confirm
and
strengthen
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
double
crime
,
the
circumstance
under
which
it
have
be
commit
,
the
length
of
time
that
have
elapse
,
and
its
discovery
in
spite
of
all
,
make
him
,
as
it
be
,
the
visible
object
of
the
Almighty
's
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
the
crime
and
vice
and
moral
gloom
of
the
great
pest
-
house
of
the
capital
,
he
stand
alone
,
mark
and
single
out
by
his
great
guilt
,
a
Lucifer
among
the
devil
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
prisoner
be
a
host
,
hide
and
shelter
each
other
---
a
crowd
like
that
without
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
one
man
against
the
whole
united
concourse
;
a
single
,
solitary
,
lonely
man
,
from
whom
the
very
captive
in
the
jail
fall
off
and
shrink
appal
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
the
intelligence
of
his
capture
have
be
bruit
abroad
,
they
have
come
there
purposely
to
drag
him
out
and
kill
him
in
the
street
;
or
it
may
be
that
they
be
the
rioter
,
and
,
in
pursuance
of
an
old
design
,
have
come
to
sack
the
prison
.
<EOS>
but
in
either
case
he
have
no
belief
or
hope
that
they
would
spare
him
.
 
<EOS>
every
shout
they
raise
,
and
every
sound
they
make
,
be
a
blow
upon
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
attack
go
on
,
he
grow
more
wild
and
frantic
in
his
terror
:
try
to
pull
away
the
bar
that
guard
the
chimney
and
prevent
him
from
climb
up
:
call
loudly
on
the
turnkey
to
cluster
round
the
cell
and
save
him
from
the
fury
of
the
rabble
;
or
put
him
in
some
dungeon
underground
,
no
matter
of
what
depth
,
how
dark
it
be
,
or
loathsome
,
or
beset
with
rat
and
creep
thing
,
so
that
it
hide
him
and
be
hard
to
find
.
  
<EOS>
but
no
one
come
,
or
answer
him
.
 
<EOS>
fearful
,
even
while
he
cry
to
them
,
of
attract
attention
,
he
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
bye
<EOS>
,
he
see
,
as
he
look
from
his
grate
window
,
a
strange
glimmering
on
the
stone
wall
and
pavement
of
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
feeble
at
first
,
and
come
and
go
,
as
though
some
officer
with
torch
be
pass
to
and
fro
upon
the
roof
of
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
soon
it
redden
,
and
light
brand
come
whirl
down
,
spatter
the
ground
with
fire
,
and
burn
sullenly
in
corner
.
 
<EOS>
one
roll
beneath
a
wooden
bench
,
and
set
it
in
a
blaze
;
another
catch
a
water
-
spout
,
and
so
go
climb
up
the
wall
,
leave
a
long
straight
track
of
fire
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
a
slow
thick
shower
of
burn
fragment
,
from
some
upper
portion
of
the
prison
which
be
blaze
nigh
,
begin
to
fall
before
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
remember
that
it
open
outward
,
he
know
that
every
spark
which
fall
upon
the
heap
,
and
in
the
act
lose
its
bright
life
,
and
die
an
ugly
speck
of
dust
and
rubbish
,
help
to
entomb
him
in
a
live
grave
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
though
the
jail
resound
with
shriek
and
cry
for
help
,
---
though
the
fire
bound
up
as
if
each
separate
flame
have
have
a
tiger
's
life
,
and
roar
as
though
,
in
every
one
,
there
be
a
hungry
voice
---
though
the
heat
begin
to
grow
intense
,
and
the
air
suffocating
,
and
the
clamour
without
increase
,
and
the
danger
of
his
situation
even
from
one
merciless
element
be
every
moment
more
extreme
,
---
<EOS>
still
he
be
afraid
to
raise
his
voice
again
,
lest
the
crowd
should
break
in
,
and
should
,
of
their
own
ear
or
from
the
information
give
them
by
the
other
prisoner
,
get
the
clue
to
his
place
of
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
thus
fearful
alike
,
of
those
within
the
prison
and
of
those
without
;
of
noise
and
silence
;
light
and
darkness
;
of
be
release
,
and
be
leave
there
to
die
;
he
be
so
tortured
and
torment
,
that
nothing
man
have
ever
do
to
man
in
the
horrible
caprice
of
power
and
cruelty
,
exceed
his
self
-
inflict
punishment

<EOS>
now
,
now
,
the
door
be
down
.
 
<EOS>
now
they
come
rush
through
the
jail
,
call
to
each
other
in
the
vaulted
passage
;
clash
the
iron
gate
divide
yard
from
yard
;
beat
at
the
door
of
cell
and
ward
;
wrench
off
bolt
and
lock
and
bar
;
tear
down
the
door
-
post
to
get
man
out
;
endeavour
to
drag
them
by
main
force
through
gap
and
window
where
a
child
could
scarcely
pass
;
whooping
and
yell
without
a
moment
's
rest
;
and
run
through
the
heat
and
flame
as
if
they
be
case
in
metal
.
 
<EOS>
by
their
leg
,
their
arm
,
the
hair
upon
their
head
,
they
drag
the
prisoner
out
.
 
<EOS>
some
throw
themselves
upon
the
captive
as
they
get
towards
the
door
,
and
try
to
file
away
their
iron
;
some
dance
about
them
with
a
frenzied
joy
,
and
rent
their
clothe
,
and
be
ready
,
as
it
seem
,
to
tear
them
limb
from
limb
.
 
<EOS>
now
a
party
of
a
dozen
man
come
dart
through
the
yard
into
which
the
murderer
cast
fearful
glance
from
his
darken
window
;
drag
a
prisoner
along
the
ground
whose
dress
they
have
nearly
tear
from
his
body
in
their
mad
eagerness
to
set
him
free
,
and
who
be
bleed
and
senseless
in
their
hand
.
 
<EOS>
now
a
score
of
prisoner
run
to
and
fro
,
who
have
lose
themselves
in
the
intricacy
of
the
prison
,
and
be
so
bewilder
with
the
noise
and
glare
that
they
know
not
where
to
turn
or
what
to
do
,
and
still
cry
out
for
help
,
as
loudly
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
Anon
some
famished
wretch
whose
theft
have
be
a
loaf
of
bread
,
or
scrap
of
butcher

meat
,
come
skulk
past

barefoote

<EOS>
go
slowly
away
because
that
jail
,
his

be
burn

not
because
he
have
any
other

or
have
friend
to
meet

or
old
haunt
to
revisit
,
or
any
liberty
to
gain

liberty
to
starve

die

<EOS>
and
then
a
knot
of
highwayman
go
troop
by
,
conduct
by
the
friend
they
have
among
the
crowd
,
who
muffle
their
fetter
as
they
go
along
,
with
handkerchief
and
band
of
hay
,
and
wrap
them
in
coat
and
cloak
,
and
give
them
drink
from
bottle
,
and
hold
it
to
their
lip

because
of
their
handcuff
which
there
be
no

all
this

Heaven
know
how

a

like
nothing

He

look
down

upon

when
a
band
of
man
with
torch

many
kind
of
weapon

pour
into

inquire

<EOS>
He
leave
the
window
when
he
see
them
come
,
and
draw
back
into
the
remote
corner
of
the
cell
;
but
although
he
return
them
no
answer
,
they
have
a
fancy
that
some
one
be
inside
,
for
they
presently
set
ladder
against
it
,
and
begin
to
tear
away
the
bar
at
the
casement
;
not
only
that
,
indeed
,
but
with
pickaxe
to
hew
down
the
very
stone
in
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
have
make
a
breach
at
the
window
,
large
enough
for
the
admission
of
a
man
's
head
,
one
of
them
thrust
in
a
torch
and
look
all
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
follow
this
man
's
gaze
until
it
rest
on
himself
,
and
hear
him
demand
why
he
have
not
answer
,
but
make
him
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
general
surprise
and
wonder
,
they
be
use
to
this
;
without
say
anything
more
,
they
enlarge
the
breach
until
it
be
large
enough
to
admit
the
body
of
a
man
,
and
then
come
drop
down
upon
the
floor
,
one
after
another
,
until
the
cell
be
full
.
 
<EOS>
They
catch
him
up
among
them
,
hand
him
to
the
window
,
and
those
who
stand
upon
the
ladder
pass
him
down
upon
the
pavement
of
the
yard
.
<EOS>
then
the
rest
come
out
,
one
after
another
,
and
,
bid
him
fly
,
and
lose
no
time
,
or
the
way
would
be
choke
up
,
hurry
away
to
rescue
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
not
a
minute
's
work
from
first
to
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
stagger
to
his
foot
,
incredulous
of
what
have
happen
,
when
the
yard
be
fill
again
,
and
a
crowd
rush
on
,
hurry
Barnaby
among
them
.
<EOS>
in
another
minute
---
not
so
much
:
another
minute
!
<EOS>
the
same
instant
,
with
no
lapse
or
interval
between
!
---
he
and
his
son
be
be
pass
from
hand
to
hand
,
through
the
dense
crowd
in
the
street
,
and
be
glance
backward
at
a
burn
pile
which
some
one
say
be
Newgate
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
moment
of
their
first
entrance
into
the
prison
,
the
crowd
disperse
themselves
about
it
,
and
swarm
into
every
chink
and
crevice
,
as
if
they
have
a
perfect
acquaintance
with
its
innermost
part
,
and
bear
in
their
mind
an
exact
plan
of
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
immediate
knowledge
of
the
place
,
they
be
,
no
doubt
,
in
a
great
degree
,
indebte
to
the
hangman
,
who
stand
in
the
lobby
,
direct
some
to
go
this
way
,
some
that
,
and
some
the
other
;
and
who
materially
assist
in
bring
about
the
wonderful
rapidity
with
which
the
release
of
the
prisoner
be
effect
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
functionary
of
the
law
reserve
one
important
piece
of
intelligence
,
and
keep
it
snugly
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
issue
his
instruction
relative
to
every
other
part
of
the
building
,
and
the
mob
be
disperse
from
end
to
end
,
and
busy
at
their
work
,
he
take
a
bundle
of
key
from
a
kind
of
cupboard
in
the
wall
,
and
go
by
a
kind
of
passage
near
the
chapel
<EOS>
(
it
join
the
governor
house
,
and
be
then
on
fire
)
,
betook
himself
to
the
condemn
cell
,
which
be
a
series
of
small
,
strong
,
dismal
room
,
open
on
a
low
gallery
,
guard
,
at
the
end
at
which
he
enter
,
by
a
strong
iron
wicket
,
and
at
its
opposite
extremity
by
two
door
and
a
thick
grate
.
 
<EOS>
have
double
lock
the
wicket
,
and
assure
himself
that
the
other
entrance
be
well
secure
,
he
sit
down
on
a
bench
in
the
gallery
,
and
suck
the
head
of
his
stick
with
the
utmost
complacency
,
tranquillity
,
and
contentment
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
strange
enough
,
a
man
's
enjoy
himself
in
this
quiet
manner
,
while
the
prison
be
burn
,
and
such
a
tumult
be
cleave
the
air
,
though
he
have
be
outside
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
,
in
the
very
heart
of
the
building
,
and
moreover
with
the
prayer
and
cry
of
the
four
man
under
sentence
sound
in
his
ear
,
and
their
hand
,
stretch
our
through
the
grating
in
their
cell
-
door
,
clasp
in
frantic
entreaty
before
his
very
eye
,
it
be
particularly
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr
Dennis
appear
to
think
it
an
uncommon
circumstance
,
and
to
banter
himself
upon
it
;
for
he
thrust
his
hat
on
one
side
as
some
man
do
when
they
be
in
a
waggish
humour
,
suck
the
head
of
his
stick
with
a
high
relish
,
and
smile
as
though
he
would
say
,
"
Dennis
,
you
be
a
rum
dog
;
you
be
a
queer
fellow
;
you
be
capital
company
,
Dennis
,
and
quite
a
character
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
sit
in
this
way
for
some
minute
,
while
the
four
man
in
the
cell
,
who
be
certain
that
somebody
have
enter
the
gallery
,
but
could
not
see
who
,
give
vent
to
such
piteous
entreaty
as
wretch
in
their
miserable
condition
may
be
suppose
to
have
be
inspire
with
:
urge
,
whoever
it
be
,
to
set
them
at
liberty
,
for
the
love
of
Heaven
;
and
protest
,
with
great
fervour
,
and
truly
enough
,
perhaps
,
for
the
time
,
that
if
they
escape
,
they
would
amend
their
way
,
and
would
never
,
never
,
never
again
do
wrong
before
God
or
man
,
but
would
lead
penitent
and
sober
life
,
and
sorrowfully
repent
the
crime
they
have
commit
.
 
<EOS>
the
terrible
energy
with
which
they
speak
,
would
have
move
any
person
,
no
matter
how
good
or
just
(
if
any
good
or
just
person
could
have
stray
into
that
sad
place
that
night
)
,
to
have
set
them
at
liberty
:
and
,
while
he
would
have
leave
any
other
punishment
to
its
free
course
,
to
have
save
them
from
this
last
dreadful
and
repulsive
penalty
;
which
never
turn
a
man
incline
to
evil
,
and
have
harden
thousand
who
be
half
inclined
to
good
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
,
who
have
be
breed
and
nurture
in
the
good
old
school
,
and
have
administer
the
good
old
law
on
the
good
old
plan
,
always
once
and
sometimes
twice
every
six
week
,
for
a
long
time
,
bear
these
appeal
with
a
deal
of
philosophy
.
 
<EOS>
be
at
last
,
however
,
rather
disturb
in
his
pleasant
reflection
by
their
repetition
,
he
rap
at
one
of
the
door
with
his
stick
,
and
cry
:
  
"
hold
your
noise
there
<EOS>
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
they
all
cry
together
that
they
be
to
be
hang
on
the
next
day
but
one
;
and
again
implore
his
aid
.
  
<EOS>
"
aid
!
<EOS>
for
what
!
"
say
Mr
Dennis
,
playfully
rap
the
knuckle
of
the
hand
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
save
us
!
"
<EOS>
they
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
"
say
Mr
Dennis
,
wink
at
the
wall
in
the
absence
of
any
friend
with
whom
he
could
humour
the
joke
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
be
to
be
work
off
,
be
you
,
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
unless
we
be
release
to

night
,
"
one
of
them
cry
,
"
we
be
dead
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
it
be
,
"
say
the
hangman
,
gravely
;
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
my
friend

that
you

;
you

<EOS>
Will
you
leave
off
that
'

indecent
row
?
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
an't
ashamed
of
yourself
,
I
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
follow
up
this
reproof
by
rap
every
set
of
knuckle
one
after
the
other
,
and
have
do
so
,
resume
his
seat
again
with
a
cheerful
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
have
law

"
he
say
,
cross
his
leg
and
elevate
his
eyebrow
:
"

a

<EOS>
WILL

in
the
furth

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
groan
be
the
only
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
well
as
I
can
make
out
,
"
say
Mr
Dennis
,
in
a
tone
of
mingle
badinage
and
remonstrance
,
"
there
be
not
a
man
among
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
be
on
the
opposite
side
,
and
<EOS>
among
the
lady
;
though
for
the
matter
of
that
,
I
have
see
a
many
lady
face
it
out

in
a
manner
that
do
honour

the
sex

<EOS>
---
You
in

two

do
not

them
tooth

bad
manner

say
the
hangman

rap
at
the
door
with
his
stick
,
"
I
never

in
this
place
afore

<EOS>
I
be
ashamed

<EOS>
You
be
a
disgrace
to
the
Bailey

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
pause
for
a
moment
to
hear
if
anything
could
be
plead
in
justification
,
Mr
Dennis
resume
in
a
sort
of
coax
tone
:
  
"
<EOS>
now
look'ee
here
,
you
four
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
come
here
to
take
care

and
see
that
you
an't
burn
,
instead
of
the
other
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
<EOS>
your
make
any
noise
,
for
you
will
not
be
find
out
by
them
as
have
break
in
,
and
you
will
only
be
hoarse
when
you
come
to
the
speech

which
be
a
pity
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
say
in
respect
to
the
speech
always
be
,
"
give
it

"
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
maxim

<EOS>
give
it
mouth

<EOS>
I

say
the
hangman
,
pull
off
his
hat
to
take
his
handkerchief
from
the
crown
and
wipe
his
face
,
and
then
put
it
on
again
a
little
more
on
one
side
than
before
,
"
I
have
heerd
a
eloquence
on
them
board
---
you
know
what
board
<EOS>
I
mean
---
and
have
heerd
a
degree
of
mouth
give
to
them
speech
,
that
they
be
as
clear
as
a
bell
,
and
as
good
as
a

<EOS>
there
be
a
pattern

<EOS>
and
always
,
when
a
thing
of
this

be
to
come
off

what
I
stand
up
for

be
,
a

<EOS>
let
's
have
a
proper

we
can
go
through
with
it

creditable

pleasant

whatever

(

I
address
myself
in
particular

to
you

never

I
would
sooner
by
half
,

I
lose
by
it
,
see
a
man
tear
his

a

It

to

"
  
<EOS>
while
the
hangman
address
them
to
this
effect
,
in
the
tone
and
with
the
air
of
a
pastor
in
familiar
conversation
with
his
flock
,
the
noise
have
be
in
some
degree
subdue
;
for
the
rioter
be
busy
in
convey
the
prisoner
to
the
Sessions
House
,
which
be
beyond
the
main
wall
of
the
prison
,
though
connect
with
it

and
the
crowd
be
busy
too
,
in
pass
them
from
thence
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
get
thus
far
in
his
discourse
,
the
sound
of
voice
in
the
yard
show
plainly
that
the
mob
have
return
and
be
come
that
way
;
and
directly
afterwards
a
violent
crashing
at
the
grate
below
,
give
note
of
their
attack
upon
the
cell
(
as
they
be
call
)
at
last

<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
the
hangman
run
from
door
to
door
,
and
cover
the
grate
,
one
after
another
,
with
his
hat
,
in
futile
effort
to
stifle
the
cry
of
the
four
man
within
;
it
be
in
vain
he
dog
their
outstretched
hand
,
and
beat
them
with
his
stick
,
or
menace
them
with
new

linger
pain
in
the
execution
of
his
office

the
place
resound
with
their
cry

<EOS>
these
,
together
with
the
feeling
that
they
be
now
the
last
man
in
the
jail
,
so
work
upon
and
stimulate
the
besieger
,
that
in
an
incredibly
short

of

they
force
the
strong
grate
down

Hugh
pause
no

but
goad
alike
by
the
cry
of
the
convict
,
and
by
the
impatience
of
the
crowd
,
warn
the
man
immediately
behind
him
---
the
way
be
only
wide
enough
for
one
abreast

to
stand
back

and
wield
a
sledge

hammer
with
such
strength

that
after
a

<EOS>
It

of
one
of
these

,
of
whom
mention
have
be
make
,
be
furious
in
their
zeal
before

they
have
now
the
wrath
and
vigour
of
lion
.
 
<EOS>
call
to
the
man
within
each
cell
,
to
keep
as
far
back
as
he
could
,
lest
the
axis
crash
through
the
door
should
wound
him
,
a
party
go
to
work
upon
each
one
,
to
beat
it
in
by
sheer
strength
,
and
force
the
bolt
and
staple
from
their
hold

<EOS>
but
although
these
two
lad
have
the
weak
party

and
do
not

<EOS>
as
they
drag
him
into

gallery
to
knock
off
his
iron

he
fall
down

a
mere

with
no

<EOS>
the

of
these
four
wretched
creature
,
and
convey
them
,
astounded
and
bewilder
,
into
the
street
so
full
of
life
---
a
spectacle
they
have
never
think
to
see
again
,
until
they
emerge
from
solitude
and
silence
upon
that
last
journey
,
when
the
air
should
be
heavy
with
the
pen
-
up
breath
of
thousand
,
and
the
street
and
house
should
be
build
and
roof
with
human
face
,
not
with
brick
and
tile
and
stone
---
be
the
crowning
horror
of
the
scene

<EOS>
Their
pale
and
haggard
look
and
hollow
eye
;
<EOS>
their
staggering
foot
,
and
hand
stretch
out
as
if
to
save
themselves
from
fall
;
their
wandering
and
uncertain
air
;
the
way
they
heave
and
gasp
for
breath
,
as
though
in
water
,
when
they
be
first
plunge
into
the
crowd
;
all
mark
them
for
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
no
need
to
say
"
this
one
be
doom
to
die
;
"
for
there
be
the
word
broadly
stamp
and
brand
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
the
crowd
fall
off
,
as
if
they
have
be
lay
out
for
burial
,
and
have
rise
in
their
shroud
;
and
many
be
see
to
shudder
,
as
though
they
have
be
actually
dead
man
,
when
they
chance
to
touch
or
brush
against
their
garment
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
bidding
of
the
mob
,
the
house
be
all
illuminate
that
night
---
light
up
from
top
to
bottom
as
at
a
time
of
public
gaiety
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
many
year
afterwards
,
old
people
who
live
in
their
youth
near
this
part
of
the
city
,
remember
be
in
a
great
glare
of
light
,
within
door
and
without
,
and
as
they
look
,
timid
and
frightened
child
,
from
the
window
,
see
a
face
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
whole
great
crowd
and
all
its
other
terror
have
fade
from
their
recollection
,
this
one
object
remain
;
alone
,
distinct
,
and
well
remember
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
the
unpractised
mind
of
infant
,
one
of
these
doom
man
dart
past
,
and
<EOS>
but
an
instant
see
,
be
an
image
of
force
enough
to
dim
the
whole
concourse
;
to
find
itself
an
all
-
absorb
place
,
and
hold
it
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
last
task
have
be
achieve
,
the
shout
and
cry
grow
fainter
;
the
clank
of
fetter
,
which
have
resound
on
all
side
as
the
prisoner
escape
,
be
hear
no
more
;
all
the
noise
of
the
crowd
subside
into
a
hoarse
and
sullen
murmur
as
it
pass
into
the
distance
;
and
when
the
human
tide
have
roll
away
,
a
melancholy
heap
of
smoking
ruin
mark
the
spot
where
it
have
lately
chafe

<EOS>
although
he
have
have
no
rest
upon
the
previous
night
,
and
have
watch
with
little
intermission
for
some
week
past
,
sleep
only
in
the
day
by
start
and
snatch
,
Mr
Haredale
,
from
the
dawn
of
morning
until
sunset
,
seek
his
niece
in
every
place
where
he
deem
it
possible
<EOS>
she
could
have
take
refuge
.
 
<EOS>
all
day
long
,
nothing
,
save
a
draught
of
water
,
pass
his
lip
;
though
he
prosecute
his
inquiry
far
and
wide
,
and
never
so
much
as
sit
down
,
once
.
  
<EOS>
in
every
quarter
he
could
think
of
;
at
Chigwell
and
in
London
;
at
the
house
of
the
tradespeople
with
whom
he
deal
,
and
of
the
friend
he
know
;
he
pursue
his
search
.
 
<EOS>
a
prey
to
the
most
harrowing
anxiety
and
apprehension
,
he
go
from
magistrate
to
magistrate
,
and
finally
to
the
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
comfort
he
receive
be
from
this
minister
,
who
assure
him
that
the
Government
,
be
now
drive
to
the
exercise
of
the
extreme
prerogative
of
the
Crown
,
be
determine
to
exert
them
;
that
a
proclamation
would
probably
be
out
upon
the
morrow
,
give
to
the
military
,
discretionary
and
unlimited
power
in
the
suppression
of
the
riot
;
that
the
sympathy
of
the
King
,
the
administration
,
and
both
Houses
of
Parliament
,
and
indeed
of
all
good
man
of
every
religious
persuasion
,
be
strongly
with
the
injure
Catholics
;
and
that
justice
should
be
do
them
at
any
cost
or
hazard
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
him
,
moreover
,
that
other
person
whose
house
have
be
burn
,
have
for
a
time
lose
sight
of
their
child
or
their
relative
,
but
have
,
in
every
case
,
within
his
knowledge
,
succeed
in
discover
them
;
that
his
complaint
should
be
remember
,
and
fully
state
in
the
instruction
give
to
the
officer
in
command
,
and
to
all
the
inferior
myrmidon
of
justice
;
and
that
everything
that
could
be
do
to
help
him
,
should
be
do
,
with
a
goodwill
and
in
good
faith
.
  
<EOS>
grateful
for
this
consolation
,
feeble
as
it
be
in
its
reference
to
the
past
,
and
little
hope
as
it
afford
him
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
distress
which
lie
near
to
his
heart
;
and
really
thankful
for
the
interest
the
minister
express
,
and
seem
to
feel
,
in
his
condition
;
Mr
Haredale
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
himself
,
with
the
night
come
on
,
alone
in
the
street
;
and
destitute
of
any
place
in
which
to
lay
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
He
enter
an
hotel
near
Charing
Cross
,
and
order
some
refreshment
and
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
that
his
faint
and
worn
appearance
attract
the
attention
of
the
landlord
and
his
waiter
;
and
think
that
they
may
suppose
him
to
be
penniless
,
take
out
his
purse
,
and
lay
it
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
,
the
landlord
say
,
in
a
falter
voice
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
one
of
those
who
have
suffer
by
the
rioter
,
he
durst
not
give
him
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
family
of
child
,
and
have
be
twice
warn
to
be
careful
in
receive
guest
.
 
<EOS>
He
heartily
pray
his
forgiveness
,
but
what
could
he
do
?
  
<EOS>
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
feel
that
more
sincerely
than
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
the
man
as
much
,
and
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
feel
that
he
may
have
anticipate
this
occurrence
,
after
what
he
have
see
at
Chigwell
in
the
morning
,
where
no
man
dare
to
touch
a
spade
,
though
he
offer
a
large
reward
to
all
who
would
come
and
dig
among
the
ruin
of
his
house
,
he
walk
along
the
Strand
;
too
proud
to
expose
himself
to
another
refusal
,
and
of
too
generous
a
spirit
to
involve
in
distress
or
ruin
any
honest
tradesman
who
may
be
weak
enough
to
give
him
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
He
wander
into
one
of
the
street
by
the
side
of
the
river
,
and
be
pace
in
a
thoughtful
manner
up
and
down
,
think
of
thing
that
have
happen
long
ago
,
when
he
hear
a
servant
-
man
at
an
upper
window
call
to
another
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
that
the
mob
be
set
fire
to
Newgate
.
  
<EOS>
to
Newgate

<EOS>
where
that

be
!

His
fail
strength
return
,
his
energy
come
back
with
tenfold
vigour
,
on
the
instant

<EOS>
if
it
be
possible
---
if
they
should
set
the
murderer
free
---
be
he

after
all
he
have
undergo

to
die
with
the
suspicion
of
have
slay
his

brother
,
dimly
gather
about
him
---
   
<EOS>
He
have
no
consciousness
of
go
to
the
jail
;
but
there
he
stand
,
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
crowd
wedge
and
press
together
in
a
dense
,
dark
,
move
mass
;
and
there
be
the
flame
soar
up
into
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
turn
round
and
round
,
light
flash
before
his
eye
,
and
he
struggle
hard
with
two

<EOS>
They
have
by
this
time
get
him
into
a
court
,
hard
by
the
prison

<EOS>
He
look
from
one
to
the

and
as
he
try
to
release
himself
,
feel
that
he
totter
on
his

<EOS>
He

You

"
  
<EOS>
"
surely

"
say
Mr

look
in

kind

stupor
at
John

He

"
  
<EOS>
John
Grueby
add
no
entreaty
,
but
he
adopt
a
different
kind
of
persuasion
,
by
put
his
arm
through
one
of
Mr
Haredale
's
,
while
his
master
take
the
other
,
and
lead
him
away
with
all
speed
.
  
<EOS>
sensible
,
from
a
strange
lightness
in
his
head
,
and
a
difficulty
in
fix
his
thought
on
anything
,
even
to
the
extent
of
bear
his
companion
in
his
mind
for
a
minute
together
without
look
at
them

that
his
brain
be
affect
by

through
which
he
have
pass
,
and
to
which
he
be
still
a
prey
<EOS>
,
Mr
Haredale
let
them
lead
him
where
they
would
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
go
along
,
he
be
conscious
of
have
no
command
over
what
he
say
or
think
,
and
that
he
have
a
fear
of
go
mad
.
  
<EOS>
the
distiller
live
,
as
he
have
tell
him
when
they
first
meet
,
on
Holborn
Hill
,
where
he
have
great
storehouse
and
drive
a
large
trade
.
 
<EOS>
They
approach
his
house
by
a
back
entrance
,
lest
they
should
attract
the
notice
of
the
crowd
,
and
go
into
an
upper
room
which
face
towards
the
street
;
the
window
,
however
,
in
common
with
those
of
every
other
room
in
the
house
,
be
board
up
inside
,
in
order
that
,
out
of
door
,
all
may
appear
quite
dark
.
  
<EOS>
They
lay
him
on
a
sofa
in
this
chamber
,
perfectly
insensible
;
but
John
immediately
fetch
a
surgeon
,
who
take
from
him
a
large
quantity
of
blood
,
he
gradually
come
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
,
for
the
time
,
too
weak
to
walk
,
they
have
no
difficulty
in
persuade
him
to
remain
there
all
night
,
and
get
him
to
bed
without
loss
of
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
they
give
him
cordial
and
some
toast
,
and
presently
a
pretty
strong
composing
-
draught
,
under
the
influence
of
which
he
soon
fall
into
a
lethargy
,
and
,
for
a
time
,
forget
his
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
the
vintner
,
who
be
a
very
hearty
old
fellow
and
a
worthy
man
,
have
no
thought
of
go
to
bed
himself
,
for
he
have
receive
several
threaten
warning
from
the
rioter
,
and
have
indeed
go
out
that
evening
to
try
and
gather
from
the
conversation
of
the
mob
whether
his
house
be
to
be
the
next
attack
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
all
night
in
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
same
room
---
doze
a
little
now
and
then
---
and
receive
from
time
to
time
the
report
of
John
Grueby
and
two
or
three
other
trustworthy
person
in
his
employ
,
who
go
out
into
the
street
as
scout
;
and
for
whose
entertainment
an
ample
allowance
of
good
cheer
(
which
the
old
vintner
,
despite
his
anxiety
,
now
and
then
attack
himself
)
be
set
forth
in
an
adjoining
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
these
account
be
of
a
sufficiently
alarming
nature
from
the
first
;
but
as
the
night
wear
on
,
they
grow
so
much
bad
,
and
involve
such
a
fearful
amount
of
riot
and
destruction
,
that
in
comparison
with
these
new
tiding
all
the
previous
disturbance
sink
to
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
intelligence
that
come
,
be
of
the
taking
of
Newgate
,
and
the
escape
of
all
the
prisoner
,
whose
track
,
as
they
make
up
Holborn
and
into
the
adjacent
street
,
be
proclaim
to
those
citizen
who
be
shut
up
in
their
house
,
by
the
rattling
of
their
chain
,
which
form
a
dismal
concert
,
and
be
hear
in
every
direction
,
as
though
so
many
forge
be
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
the
flame
too
,
shone
so
brightly
through
the
vintner
's
skylight
,
that
the
room
and
staircase
below
be
nearly
as
light
as
in
broad
day
;
while
the
distant
shouting
of
the
mob
seem
to
shake
the
very
wall
and
ceiling
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
they
be
hear
approach
the
house
,
and
some
minute
of
terrible
anxiety
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
close
up
,
and
stop
before
it
;
but
after
give
three
loud
yell
,
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
and
although
they
return
several
time
that
night
,
create
new
alarm
each
time
,
they
do
nothing
there
;
have
their
hand
full
.
 
<EOS>
shortly
after
they
have
go
away
for
the
first
time
,
one
of
the
scout
come
run
in
with
the
news
that
they
have
stop
before
Lord
Mansfield
's
house
in
Bloomsbury
Square
.
  
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
there
come
another
,
and
another
,
and
then
the
first
return
again
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
little
and
little
,
their
tale
be
this
:
---
 
<EOS>
that
the
mob
gather
round
Lord
Mansfield
's
house
,
have
call
on
those
within
to
open
the
door
,
and
receive
no
reply
(
for
Lord
and
Lady
Mansfield
be
at
that
moment
escape
by
the
backway
)
,
force
an
entrance
accord
to
their
usual
custom
.
 
<EOS>
that
they
then
begin
to
demolish
the
house
with
great
fury
,
and
set
fire
to
it
in
several
part
,
involve
in
a
common
ruin
the
whole
of
the
costly
furniture
,
the
plate
and
jewel
,
a
beautiful
gallery
of
picture
,
the
rare
collection
of
manuscript
ever
possess
by
any
one
private
person
in
the
world
,
and
bad
than
all
,
because
nothing
could
replace
this
loss
,
the
great
Law
Library
,
on
almost
every
page
of
which
be
note
in
the
Judge
's
own
hand
,
of
inestimable
value
,
---
be
the
result
of
the
study
and
experience
of
his
whole
life
.
 
<EOS>
that
while
they
be
howl
and
exult
round
the
fire
,
a
troop
of
soldier
,
with
a
magistrate
among
them
,
come
up
,
and
be
too
late
(
for
the
mischief
<EOS>
be
by
that
time
do
)
,
begin
to
disperse
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
Riot
Act
be
read
,
and
the
crowd
still
resist
,
the
soldier
receive
order
to
fire
,
and
level
their
musket
shoot
dead
at
the
first
discharge
six
man
and
a
woman
,
and
wound
many
person
;
and
load
again
directly
,
fire
another
volley
,
but
over
the
people
's
head
it
be
suppose
,
as
none
be
see
to
fall
.
 
<EOS>
that
thereupon
,
and
daunt
by
the
shriek
and
tumult
,
the
crowd
begin
to
disperse
,
and
the
soldier
go
away
,
leave
the
kill
and
wound
on
the
ground
:
which
they
have
no
sooner
do
than
the
rioter
come
back
again
,
and
take
up
the
dead
body
,
and
the
wounded
people
,
form
into
a
rude
procession
,
have
the
body
in
the
front
.
 
<EOS>
that
in
this
order
they
parade
off
with
a
horrible
merriment
;
fix
weapon
in
the
dead
man
's
hand
to
make
them
look
as
if
alive
;
and
precede
by
a
fellow
ring
Lord
Mansfield
's
dinner
-
bell
with
all
his
might
.
  
<EOS>
the
scout
report
further
,
that
this
party
meeting
with
some
other
who
have
be
at
similar
work
elsewhere
,
they
all

into
one
,
and
draft
off
a

with
the
kill
and
wound
,
march
away
to
Lord
Mansfield
's
country
seat
at
Caen
Wood
,
between

Highgate
;
bent
upon

that
house
likewise
,
and
light
up
a
great
fire
there
,
which
from
that
height
should
be
see
all
over
London
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
,
they
be
disappoint
,
for
a
party
of
horse
have
arrive
before
them
,
they
retreat
faster
than
they
go
,
and
come
straight
back
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
now
a
great
many
party
in

each
go

its
humour

and
a

Sir

and
two

and
four

one

the
great
thoroughfare
in
London
---
which
be
all
burn
at
the
same
time
,
and
burn
until
they
go
out
of
themselves
,
for
the
people
cut
the
engine
hose
,
and
would
not
suffer
the
fireman
to
play
upon
the
flame
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
house
near
Moorfields
,
they
find
in
one
of
the
room
some
canary
bird
in
cage
,
and
these
they
cast
into
the
fire
alive
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
little
creature

,
it
be

like
infant

when
they
be
fling
upon
the
blaze
;
and
one
man
be
so
touched
that
he
try
in
vain
to
save
them
,
which
rouse
the
indignation
of
the
crowd
,
and
nearly
cost
him
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
same
house
,
one
of
the
fellow
who
go
through
the
room
,
break
the
furniture
and
help
to
destroy
the
building
,
find
a
child
's
doll
---
a
poor
toy
---
which
he
exhibit
at
the
window
to
the
mob
below
,
as
the
image
of
some
unholy
saint
which
the
late
occupant
have
worship
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
do
this
,
another
man
with
an
equally
tender
conscience
(
they

down
the
canary
bird
for
roast

)
,
take
his
seat
on
the
parapet

and
harangue
the
crowd
from
a
pamphlet

by
the
Association

relative
to
the
true
principle
of
Christianity

<EOS>
meanwhile

Lord

with
his

in

an
idle
man
may
look
at
any

and
seem
mightily
satisfied

by
the
cry
of
the
mob
,
the
light
of

and
the
firing
of
the

such
,
with
the
addition
of
the
release
of

the

sit
talk
there
,
or
even
eat
and
drink
,
as
in
a
choice
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
besides
the
notice
on
the
gate
of
the
Fleet
and
the
King
's
Bench
,
many
similar
announcement
be
leave
,
before
one
o'clock
at
noon
,
at
the
house
of
private
individual
;
and
further
,
the
mob
proclaim
their
intention
of
seize
on
the
Bank
,
the
Mint
,
the
Arsenal
at
Woolwich
,
and
the
Royal
Palaces
.
 
<EOS>
the
notice
be
seldom
deliver
by
more
than
one
man
,
who
,
if
it
be
at
a
shop
,
go
in
,
and
lay
it
,
with
a
bloody
threat
perhaps
,
upon
the
counter
;
or
if
it
be
at
a
private
house
,
knock
at
the
door
,
and
thrust
it
in
the
servant
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
the
military
in
every
quarter
of
the
town
,
and
the
great
force
in
the
Park
,
these
messenger
do
their
errand
with
impunity
all
through
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
two
boy
who
go
down
Holborn
alone
,
arm
with
bar
take
from
the
railing
of
Lord
Mansfield
's
house
,
and
demand
money
for
the
rioter
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
a
tall
man
on
horseback
who
make
a
collection
for
the
same
purpose
in
Fleet
Street
,
and
refuse
to
take
anything
but
gold
.
  
<EOS>
a
rumour
have
now
get
into
circulation
,
too
,
which
diffuse
a
great
dread
all
through
London
,
even
than
these
publicly
announce
intention
of
the
rioter
,
though
all
man
know
that
if
they
be
successfully
effect
,
there
must
ensue
a
national
bankruptcy
and
general
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
they
mean
to
throw
the
gate
of
Bedlam
open
,
and
let
all
the
madman
loose
.
 
<EOS>
this
suggest
such
dreadful
image
to
the
people
's
mind
,
and
be
indeed
an
act
so
fraught
with
new
and
unimaginable
horror
in
the
contemplation
,
that
it
beset
them
more
than
any
loss
or
cruelty
of
which
they
could
foresee
the
bad
,
and
drive
many
sane
man
nearly
mad
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
day
pass
on
:
the
prisoner
move
their
good
;
people
run
to
and
fro
in
the
street
,
carry
away
their
property
;
group
stand
in
silence
round
the
ruin
;
all
business
suspend
;
and
the
soldier
dispose
as
have
be
already
mention
,
remain
quite
inactive
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
day
pass
on
,
and
dread
night
draw
near
again
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
the
Privy
Council
issue
a
solemn
proclamation
that
it
be
now
necessary
to
employ
the
military

and
that
the
officer
have
most
direct
and
effectual
order
,
by
an
immediate
exertion
of
their
utmost
force
,
to
repress
the
disturbance
;
and
warn
all
good
subject
of
the
King
to
keep
themselves
,
their

<EOS>
there
be
then

every
soldier
on

,
thirty
-
six

powder
and
ball

and
the
whole
force

at
sunset

<EOS>
the
City

,
stimulate
by
these
vigorous
measure
,
hold
a
Common
Council
;
pass
a
vote
thank
the
military
association
who
have
tender
their
aid
to
the
civil
authority
;
accept
it
;
and
place
them
under
the
direction
of
the
two
sheriff
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
Queen

palace
,
a
double
guard
,
the
yeoman

,
the
groom

and
all
other

in
the
passage
and
on
the
staircase
at
seven
o'clock
,
with
strict
instruction
to
be
watchful
on
their
post
all
night
;
and
all
the
door
be
lock
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
of
the
Temple
,
and
the
other
Inns
,
mount
guard
within
their
gate
,
and
strengthen
them
with
the
great
stone
of
the
pavement
,
which
they
take
up
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
they
give
up
the
hall
and
common
to
the
Northumberland
Militia
,
under
the
command
of
Lord
Algernon
Percy
;
in
some
few
of
the
city
ward
,
the
burgess
turn
out
,
and
without
make
a
very
fierce
show
,
look
brave
enough
.
 
<EOS>
some
hundred
of
stout
gentleman
throw
themselves
,
arm
to
the
tooth
,
into
the
hall
of
the
different
company
,
double
-
lock
and
bolt
all
the
gate
,
and
dare
the
rioter
(
among
themselves
)
to
come
on
at
their
peril
.
 
<EOS>
these
arrangement
be
all
make
simultaneously
,
or
nearly
so
,
be
complete
by
the
time
it
get
dark
;
and
then
the
street
be
comparatively
clear
,
and
be
guard
at
all
the
great
corner
and
chief
avenue
by
the
troop
:
while
party
of
the
officer
ride
up
and
down
in
all
direction
,
order
chance
straggler
home
,
and
admonish
the
resident
to
keep
within
their
house
,
and
,
if
any
firing
ensue
,
not
to
approach
the
window
.
<EOS>
More
chain
be
draw
across
such
of
the
thoroughfare
as
be
of
a
nature
to
favour
the
approach
of
a
great
crowd
,
and
at
each
of
these
point
a
considerable
force
be
station
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
precaution
have
be
take
,
and
it
be
now
quite
dark
,
those
in
command
await
the
result
in
some
anxiety
:
and
not
without
a
hope
that
such
vigilant
demonstration
may
of
themselves
dishearten
the
populace
,
and
prevent
any
new
outrage
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
this
reckoning
they
be
cruelly
mistaken
,
for
in
half
an
hour
,
or
less
,
as
though
the
setting
in
of
night
have
be
their
preconcerte
signal
,
the
rioter
have
previously
,
in
small
party
,
<EOS>
prevent
the
lighting
of
the
street
lamp
,
rise
like
a
great
sea
;
and
that
in
so
many
place
at
once
,
and
with
such
inconceivable
fury
,
that
those
who
have
the
direction
of
the
troop
know
not
,
at
first
,
where
to
turn
or
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
one
after
another
,
new
fire
blaze
up
in
every
quarter
of
the
town
,
as
though
it
be
the
intention
of
the
insurgent
to
wrap
the
city
in
a
circle
of
flame
,
which
,
contract
by
degree
,
should
burn
the
whole
to
ashe
;
the
crowd
swarm
and
roar
in
every
street
;
and
none
but
rioter
and
soldier
be
out
of
door
,
it
seem
to
the
latter
as
if
all
London
be
array
against
them
,
and
they
stand
alone
against
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
in
two
hour
,
six

and

thirty
fire

rage
---
six

thirty
great
conflagration
:
among
them
the
Borough
Clink
in
Tooley
Street
,
the
King

Bench
,
the
Fleet
,
and
the
New
Bridewell
.
 
<EOS>
in
almost
every
street
,
there
be
a
battle
;
and
in
every
quarter
the
musket
of
the
troop
be
hear
above
the
shout
and
tumult
of
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
the
firing
begin
in
the
Poultry
,
where
the
chain
be
draw
across
the
road
,
where
nearly
a
score
of
people
be
kill
on
the
first
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
Their
body
have
be
hastily
carry
into
St
Mildred
's
Church
by
the
soldier
,
the
latter
fire
again
,
and
follow
fast
upon
the
crowd
,
who
begin
to
give
way
when
they
see
the
execution
that
be
do
,
form
across
Cheapside
,
and
charge
them
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
.
  
<EOS>
the
street
be
now
a
dreadful
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
the
shout
of
the
rabble
,
the
shriek
of
woman
,
the
cry
of
the
wound
,
and
the
constant
firing
,
form
a
deafening
and
an
awful
accompaniment
to
the
sight
which
every
corner
present
.
 
<EOS>
wherever
the
road
be
obstruct
by
the
chain
,
<EOS>
there
the
fighting
and
the
loss
of
life
be
great
;
but
there
be
hot
work
and
bloodshe
in
almost
every
lead
thoroughfare
.
  
<EOS>
at
Holborn
Bridge
,
and
on
Holborn
Hill
,
the
confusion
be
great
than
in
any
other
part
;
for
the
crowd
that
pour
out
of
the
city
in
two
great
stream
,
one
by
Ludgate
Hill
,
and
one
by
Newgate
Street
,
unite
at
that
spot
,
and
form
a
mass
so
dense
,
that
at
every
volley
the
people
seem
to
fall
in
heap
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
place
a
large
detachment
of
soldiery
be
post
,
who
fire
,
now
up
<EOS>
Fleet
Market
,
now
up
Holborn
,
now
up
<EOS>
Snow

---
constantly
rake
the
street
in
each
direction
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
place
too
,
several
large
fire
be
burn
,
so
that
all
the
terror
of
that
terrible
night
seem
to
be
concentrate
in
one
spot
.
  
<EOS>
full
twenty
time
,
the
rioter
,
head
by
one
man
who
wield
an
axe
in
his
right
hand
,
and
bestrode
a

horse
of
great
size
and
strength

caparison
with
fetter
take
out
of
Newgate

which
clank
and
jingle
as
he
go
,
make
an
attempt
to
force
a
passage
at
this
point
,
and
fire
the
vintner
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
full
twenty
time
they
be
repulse
with
loss
of
life
,
and
still
come
back
again
;
and
though
the
fellow
at
their
head
be
mark
and
single
out
by
all
,
and
be
a
conspicuous
object
as
the
only
rioter
on
horseback
,
not
a
man
could
hit
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
surely
as
the
smoke
clear
away
,
so
surely
there
be
he
;
call
hoarsely
to
his
companion
,
brandish
his
axe
above
his
head
,
and
dash
on
as
though
he
bear
a
charm
life
,
and
be
proof
against
ball
and
powder
.
  
<EOS>
this
man
be
Hugh

and
in
every
part
of
the
riot
,
he
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
head
two
attack
upon
the
Bank
,
help
to
break
open
the
Toll
-
house
on
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
and
cast
the
money
into
the
street
:
fire
two
of
the
prison
with
his
own
hand
:
be
here
,
and
there
,
and
everywhere
---
always
foremost
---
always
active
---
strike
at
the
soldier
,
cheer
on
the
crowd
,
make
his
horse
's
iron
music
hear
through
all
the
yell
and
uproar
:
but
never
hurt
or
stop
.
<EOS>
turn
him
at
one
place
,
and
he
make
a
new
struggle
in
anotlter
;
force
him
to
retreat
at
this
point
,
and
he
advance
on
that
,
directly
.
 
<EOS>
drive
from
Holborn
for
the
twentieth
time
,
he
ride
at
the
head
of
a
great
crowd
straight
upon
Saint
Paul
's
,
attack
a
guard
of
soldier
who
keep
watch
over
a
body
of
prisoner
within
the
iron
railing
,
force
them
to
retreat
,
rescue
the
man
they
have
in
custody
,
and
with
this
accession
to
his
party
,
come
back
again
,
mad
with
liquor
and
excitement
,
and
halloo
them
on
like
a
demon
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
no
easy
task
for
the
most
careful
rider
to
sit
a
horse
in
the
midst
of
such
a
throng
and
tumult
;
but
though
this
madman
roll
upon
his
back
(
he
have
no
saddle
)
like
a
boat
upon
the
sea
,
he
never
for
an
instant
lose
his
seat
,
or
fail
to
guide
him
where
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
through
the
very
thickest
of
the
press
,
over
dead
body
and
burn
fragment
,
now
on
the
pavement
,
now
in
the
road
,
now
ride
up
a
flight
of
step
to
make
himself
the
more
conspicuous
to
his
party
,
and
now
force
a
passage
through
a
mass
of
human
being
,
so
closely
squeeze
together
that
it
seem
as
if
the
edge
of
a
knife
would
scarcely
part
them
,
---
on
he
go
,
as
though
he
could
surmount
all
obstacle
by
the
mere
exercise
of
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
and
perhaps
his
not
be
shoot
be
in
some
degree
attributable
to
this
very
circumstance
;
for
his
extreme
audacity
,
and
the
conviction
that
he
must
be
one
of
those
to
whom
the
proclamation
refer
,
inspire
the
soldier
with
a
desire
to
take
him
alive
,
and
divert
many
an
aim
which
otherwise
may
have
be
more
near
the
mark
.
  
<EOS>
the
vintner
and
Mr
Haredale
,
unable
to
sit
quietly
listen
to
the
noise
without
see
what
go
on
,
have
climb
to
the
roof
of
the
house
,
and
hide
behind
a
stack
of
chimney
,
be
look
cautiously
down
into
the
street
,
almost
hope
that
after
so
many
repulse
the
rioter
would
be
foil
,
when
a
great
shout
proclaim
that
a
parry
be
come
round
the
other
way
;
and
the
dismal
jingling
of
those
accurse
fetter
warn
them
next
moment
that
they
too
be
lead
by
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
the
soldier
have
advance
into
Fleet
Market
and
be
disperse
the
people
there
;
so
that
they
come
on
with
hardly
any
check
,
and
be
soon
before
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
be
over
now
,
"
say
the
vintner
.
 
<EOS>
"
fifty
thousand
pound
will
be
scatter
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
save
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
do
no
more
,
and
shall
have
reason
to
be
thankful
if
we
do
as
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Their
first
impulse
be
,
to
clamber
along
the
roof
of
the
house
,
and
,
knock
at
some
garret
window
for
admission
,
pass
down
that
way
into
the
street
,
and
so
escape
.
 
<EOS>
but
another
fierce
cry
from
below
,
and
a
general
upturning
of
the
face
of
the
crowd
,
apprise
them
that
they
be
discover
,
and
even
that
Mr
Haredale
be
recognise
;
for
Hugh
,
see
him
plainly
in
the
bright
glare
of
the
fire
,
which
in
that
part
make
it
as
light
as
day
,
call
to
him
by
his
name
,
and
swear
to
have
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
leave
me
here
,
"
say
Mr
Haredale
,
"
and
in
Heaven
's
name
,
my
good
friend
,
save
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
come
on
!
"
<EOS>
he
mutter
,
as
he
turn
towards
Hugh
and
face
him
without
any
further
effort
at
concealment
:
"
this
roof
be
high
,
and
if
we
close
,
we
will
die
together
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madness
,
"
say
the
honest
vintner
,
pull
him
back
,
"
sheer
madness
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
reason
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
good
sir
,
hear
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
make
myself
hear
by
knock
at
a
window
now
;
and
even
if
I
could
,
no
one
would
be
bold
enough
to
connive
at
my
escape
.
<EOS>
through
the
cellar
,
there
be
a
kind
of
passage
into
the
back
street
by
which
we
roll
cask
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
time
to
get
down
there
before
they
can
force
an
entry
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
delay
an
instant
,
but
come
with
me
---
for
both
our
sake
---
for
mine

good

Mr

back
,
they
have
both
a
glimpse
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
glimpse
,
but
it
show
them
the
crowd
,
gathering
and
cluster
round
the
house
:
some
of
the
armed
man
press
to
the
front
to
break
down
the
door
and
window
,
<EOS>
some
bring
brand
from
the
near
fire
,
some
with
lift
face
follow
their
course
upon
the
roof
and
point
them
out
to
their
companion
:
all
rage
and
roar
like
the
flame
they
light
up
.
<EOS>
They
see
some
man
thirst
for
the
treasure
of
strong
liquor
which
they
know
be
store
within
;
they
see
other
,
who
have
be
wound
,
sink
down
into
the
opposite
doorway
and
die
,
solitary
wretch
,
in
the
midst
of
all
the
vast
assemblage
;
here
a
frightened
woman
try
to
escape
;
and
there
a
lose
child
;
and
there
a
drunken
ruffian
,
unconscious
of
the
death
-
wound
on
his
head
,
raving
and
fighting
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
thing
,
and
even
such
trivial
incident
as
a
man
with
his
hat
off
,
or
turn
round
,
or
stoop
down
,
or
shake
hand
with
another
,
they
mark
distinctly
;
yet
in
a
glance
so
brief
,
that
,
in
the
act
of
step
back
,
they
lose
the
whole
,
and
see
<EOS>
but
the
pale
face
of
each
other
,
and
the
red
sky
above
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
yield
to
the
entreaty
of
his
companion
---
more
because
he
be
resolve
to
defend
him
,
than
for
any
thought
he
have
of
his
own
life
,
or
any
care
he
entertain
for
his
own
safety
---
and
quickly
re
-
enter
the
house
,
they
descend
the
stair
together
.
<EOS>
loud
blow
be
thunder
on
the
shutter
,
crowbar
be
already
thrust
beneath
the
door
,
the
glass
fall
from
the
sash
,
a
deep
light
shine
through
every
crevice
,
and
they
hear
the
voice
of
the
foremost
in
the
crowd
so
close
to
every
chink
and
keyhole
,
that
they
seem
to
be
hoarsely
whisper
their
threat
into
their
very
ear
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
<EOS>
but
a
moment
reach
the
bottom
of
the
cellar
-
step
and
shut
the
door
behind
them
,
when
the
mob
break
in
.
  
<EOS>
the
vault
be
profoundly
dark
,
and
have
no
torch
or
candle
---
for
they
have
be
afraid
to
carry
one
,
lest
it
should
betray
their
place
of
refuge
---
they
be
oblige
to
grope
with
their
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
not
long
without
light
,
for
they
have
not
go
far
when
they
hear
the
crowd
force
the
door
;
and
,
look
back
among
the
low
-
arched
passage
,
could
see
them
in
the
distance
,
hurry
to
and
fro
with
flashing
link
,
broach
the
cask
,
stave
the
great
vat
,
turn
off
upon
the
right
hand
and
the
left
,
into
the
different
cellar
,
and
lie
down
to
drink
at
the
channel
of
strong
spirit
which
be
already
flow
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
They
hurry
on
,
not
the
less
quickly
for
this
;
and
have
reach
the
only
vault
which
lie
between
them
and
the
passage
out
,
when
suddenly
,
from
the
direction
in
which
they
be
go
,
a
strong
light
gleam
upon
their
face
;
and
before
they
could
slip
aside
,
or
turn
back
,
or
hide
themselves
,
two
man
(
one
bear
a
torch
)
come
upon
them
,
and
cry
in
an
astonished
whisper
,
"
here
they
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
instant
they
pull
off
what
they
wear
upon
their
head
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
see
before
him
Edward
Chester
,
and
then
see
,
when
the
vintner
gasp
his
name
,
Joe
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
the
same
Joe
,
though
with
an
arm
the
less
,
who
use
to
make
the
quarterly
journey
on
the
grey
mare
to
pay
the
bill
to
the
purple
-
faced
vintner
;
and
that
very
same
purple
-
faced
vintner
,
formerly
of
Thames
Street
,
now
look
him
in
the
face
,
and
challenge
him
by
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
me
your
hand
,
"
say
Joe
softly
,
take
it
whether
the
astonished
vintner
would
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
fear
to
shake
it
;
it
be
a
friendly
one
and
a
hearty
one
,
though
it
have
no
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
how
well
you
look
and
how
bluff
you
be
!
 
<EOS>
and
you
---
God
bless
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
take
heart
,
take
heart
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
find
them
.
 
<EOS>
be
of
good
cheer
;
we
have
not
be
idle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
honest
and
frank
in
Joe
's
speech
,
that
Mr
Haredale
put
his
hand
in
his
involuntarily
,
though
their
meeting
be
suspicious
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
glance
at
Edward
Chester
,
and
that
gentleman
's
keep
aloof
,
be
not
lose
upon
Joe
,
who
say
bluntly
,
glance
at
Edward
while
he
speak
:
  
<EOS>
"
time
be
change
,
Mr
Haredale
,
and
time
have
come
when
we
ought
to
know
friend
from
enemy
,
and
make
no
confusion
of
name
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
tell
you
that
but
for
this
gentleman
,
you
would
most
likely
have
be
dead
by
this
time
,
or
badly
wound
at
the
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
?
"
cry
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
say
Joe
,
"
<EOS>
first
,
that
it
be
a
bold
thing
to
be
in
the
crowd
at
all
disguise
as
one
of
them
;
though
I
will
not
say
much
about
that
,
on
second
thought
,
for
that
be
my
case
too
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
that
it
be
a
brave
and
glorious
action
<EOS>
---
that
be
what
I
call
it
---
to
strike
that
fellow
off
his
horse
before
their
eye
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
whose
eye
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
fellow
,
sir
!
"
cry
Joe
:
"
a
fellow
who
have
no
goodwill
to
you
,
and
who
have
the
daring
and
devilry
in
him
of
twenty
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
once
in
the
house
,
he
would
have
find
you
,
here
or
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
owe
you
no
particular
grudge
,
and
,
unless
they
see
you
,
will
only
think
of
drink
themselves
dead
.
<EOS>
but
we
lose
time
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
ready
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
,
"
say
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
put
out
the
torch
,
Joe
,
and
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
silent
,
there
be
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
silent
or
not
silent
,
"
murmur
Joe
,
as
he
drop
the
flare
link
upon
the
ground
,
crush
it
with
his
foot
,
and
give
his
hand
to
Mr
Haredale
,
"
it
be
a
brave
and
glorious
action
;
---
no
man
can
alter
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
both
Mr
Haredale
and
the
worthy
vintner
be
too
amazed
and
too
much
hurried
to
ask
any
further
question
,
so
follow
their
conductor
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
,
from
a
short
whispering
which
presently
ensue
between
them
and
the
vintner
relative
to
the
good
way
of
escape
,
that
they
have
enter
by
the
back
-
door
,
with
the
connivance
of
John
Grueby
,
who
watch
outside
with
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
and
whom
they
have
take
into
their
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
a
party
of
the
crowd
come
up
that
way
,
just
as
they
enter
,
John
have
double
-
lock
the
door
again
,
and
make
off
for
the
soldier
,
so
that
mean
of
retreat
be
cut
off
from
under
them
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
front
-
door
have
be
force
,
and
this
minor
crowd
,
be
anxious
to
get
at
the
liquor
,
have
no
fancy
for
lose
time
in
break
down
another
,
but
have
go
round
and
get
in
from
Holborn
with
the
rest
,
the
narrow
lane
in
the
rear
be
quite
free
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
they
have
crawl
through
the
passage
indicate
by
the
vintner
(
which
be
a
mere
shelving
-
trap
for
the
admission
of
cask
)
,
and
have
manage
with
some
difficulty
to
unchain
and
raise
the
door
at
the
upper
end
,
they
emerge
into
the
street
without
be
observe
or
interrupt
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
still
hold
Mr
Haredale
tight
,
and
Edward
take
the
same
care
of
the
vintner
,
they
hurry
through
the
street
at
a
rapid
pace
;
occasionally
stand
aside
to
let
some
fugitive
go
by
,
or
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
soldier
who
follow
them
,
and
whose
question
,
when
they
halt
to
put
any
,
be
speedily
stop
by
one
whispered
word
from
Joe
.

Chapter
68
    
<EOS>
while
Newgate
be
burn
on
the
previous
night
,
Barnaby
and
his
father
,
have
be
pass
among
the
crowd
from
hand
to
hand
,
stand
in
Smithfield
,
on
the
outskirt
of
the
mob
,
gaze
at
the
flame
like
man
who
have
be
suddenly
rouse
from
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
some
moment
elapse
before
they
could
distinctly
remember
where
they
be
,
or
how
they
get
there
;
or
recollect
that
while
they
be
stand
idle
and
listless
spectator
of
the
fire
,
they
have
tool
in
their
hand
which
have
be
hurriedly
give
them
that
they
may
free
themselves
from
their
fetter
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
heavily
iron
as
he
be
,
if
he
have
obey
his
first
impulse
,
or
if
he
have
be
alone
,
would
have
make
his
way
back
to
the
side
of
Hugh
,
who
to
his
clouded
intellect
now
shine
forth
with
the
new
lustre
of
be
his
preserver
and
true
friend
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
father
's
terror
of
remain
in
the
street
,
communicate
itself
to
him
when
he
comprehend
the
full
extent
of
his
fear
,
and
impress
him
with
the
same
eagerness
to
fly
to
a
place
of
safety
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
corner
of
the
market
among
the
pen
for
cattle
,
Barnaby
kneel
down
,
and
pause
every
now
and
then
to
pass
his
hand
over
his
father
's
face
,
or
look
up
to
him
with
a
smile
,
knock
off
his
iron
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
see
him
spring
,
a
free
man
,
to
his
foot
,
and
have
give
vent
to
the
transport
of
delight
which
the
sight
awaken
,
he
go
to
work
upon
his
own
,
which
soon
fall
rattle
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
leave
his
limb
unfettered
.
  
<EOS>
glide
away
together
when
this
task
be
accomplish
,
and
pass
several
group
of
man
,
each
gather
round
a
stoop
figure
to
hide
him
from
those
who
pass
,
but
unable
to
repress
the
clanking
sound
of
hammer
,
which
tell
that
they
too
be
busy
at
the
same
work
,
---
the
two
fugitive
make
towards
Clerkenwell
,
and
pass
thence
to
Islington
,
as
the
near
point
of
egress
,
be
quickly
in
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
after
wander
about
for
a
long
time
,
they
find
in
a
pasture
near
Finchley
a
poor
shed
,
with
wall
of
mud
,
and
roof
of
grass
and
bramble
,
build
for
some
cowherd
,
but
now
desert
.
<EOS>
here
,
they
lie
down
for
the
rest
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
They
wander
to
and
fro
when
it
be
day
,
and
once
Barnaby
go
off
alone
to
a
cluster
of
little
cottage
two
or
three
mile
away
,
to
purchase
some
bread
and
milk
.
 
<EOS>
but
find
no
well
shelter
,
they
return
to
the
same
place
,
and
lie
down
again
to
wait
for
night
.
  
<EOS>
Heaven
alone
can
tell
,
with
what
vague
hope
of
duty
,
and
affection
;
with
what
strange
prompting
of
nature
,
intelligible
to
him
as
to
a
man
of
radiant
mind
and
most
enlarged
capacity
;
with
what
dim
memory
of
child
he
have
play
with
when
a
child
himself
,
who
have
prattle
of
their
father
,
and
of
love
them
,
and
be
love
;
with
how
many
half
-
remembered
,
dreamy
association
of
his
mother
's
grief
and
tear
and
widowhood
;
he
watch
and
tend
this
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
a
vague
and
shadowy
crowd
of
such
idea
come
slowly
on
him
;
that
they
teach
him
to
be
sorry
when
he
look
upon
his
haggard
face
,
that
they
overflow
his
eye
when
he
stoop
to
kiss
him
,
that
they
keep
him
wake
in
a
tearful
gladness
,
shade
him
from
the
sun
,
fan
him
with
leave
,
soothe
him
when
he
start
in
his
sleep
---
ah
!
<EOS>
what
a
troubled
sleep
it
be
---
and
wonder
when
she
would
come
to
join
them
and
be
happy
,
be
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
beside
him
all
that
day
;
listen
for
her
footstep
in
every
breath
of
air
,
look
for
her
shadow
on
the
gently
-
wave
grass
,
twine
the
hedge
flower
for
her
pleasure
when
she
come
,
and
his
when
he
awake
;
and
stoop
down
from
time
to
time
to
listen
to
his
muttering
,
and
wonder
why
he
be
so
restless
in
that
quiet
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
go
down
,
and
night
come
on
,
and
he
be
still
quite
tranquil
;
busied
with
these
thought
,
as
if
there
be
no
other
people
in
the
world
,
and
the
dull
cloud
of
smoke
hang
on
the
immense
city
in
the
distance
,
hide
no
vice
,
no
crime
,
no
life
or
death
,
or
cause
of
disquiet
---
<EOS>
nothing
but
clear
air
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
hour
have
now
come
when
he
must
go
alone
to
find
out
the
blind
man
(
a
task
that
fill
him
with
delight
)
and
bring
him
to
that
place
;
take
especial
care
that
he
be
not
watch
or
follow
on
his
way
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
to
the
direction
he
must
observe
,
repeat
them
again
and
again
,
and
after
twice
or
thrice
return
to
surprise
his
father
with
a
light
-
hearted
laugh
,
go
forth
,
at
last
,
upon
his
errand
:
leave
Grip
,
whom
he
have
carry
from
the
jail
in
his
arm
,
to
his
care
.
  
<EOS>
fleet
of
foot
,
and
anxious
to
return
,
he
speed
swiftly
on
towards
the
city
,
but
could
not
reach
it
before
the
fire
begin
,
and
make
the
night
angry
with
their
dismal
lustre
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
enter
the
town
---
it
may
be
that
he
be
change
by
go
there
without
his
late
companion
,
and
on
no
violent
errand
;
or
by
the
beautiful
solitude
in
which
he
have
pass
the
day
,
or
by
the
thought
that
have
come
upon
him
,
---
but
it
seem
people
by
a
legion
of
devil
.
<EOS>
this
flight
and
pursuit
,

<EOS>
It
be
shut
up
and
tenantless

<EOS>
He
wait
for
a
long
while
,
but
no

come
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
withdraw
;
and
as
he
know
by
this
time
that
the
soldier
be
fire
,
and
many
people
must
have
be
kill
,
he
go
down
into
Holborn
,
where
he
hear
the
great
crowd
be
,
to
try
if
he
could
find
Hugh
,
and
persuade
him
to
avoid
the
danger
,
and
return
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
if
he

be
stun
and
shock
before

his
horror
be
increase
a
thousandfold
when

of

and
not

an
actor
in
the
terrible
spectacle

have
it
all
before
his
eye

<EOS>
but
there
,
in
the
midst
,
tower
above
them
all
,
close
before
the
house
they
be
attack
now
,
be
Hugh
on
horseback
,
call
to
the
rest
!
  
<EOS>
sicken
by
the
sight
surround
him
on
every
side
,
and
by
the
heat
and
roar
,
and
crash
,
he
force
his
way
among
the
crowd
(
where
many
recognise
him
,
and
with
shout
press
back
to
let
him
pass
)
,
and
in
time
be
nearly
up
with
Hugh
,
who
be
savagely
threaten
some
one
,
but
whom
or
what
he
say
,
he
could
not
,
in
the
great
confusion
,
understand
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
crowd
force
their
way
into
the
house
,
and
Hugh
---
it
be
impossible
to
see
by
what
mean
,
in
such
a
concourse
---
fall
headlong
down
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
be
beside
him
when
he
stagger
to
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
well
he
make
him
hear
his
voice
,
or
Hugh
,
with
his
uplifted
axe
,
would
have
cleave
his
skull
in

"
You

Barnaby

as
indeed

in
the
head
,
both
by
the
blow
he
have
receive
,
and
by
his
horse

<EOS>
"

as

last
night

<EOS>
tell
me
,

d'ye

"
  
<EOS>
with
a
flourish
of
his
dangerous
weapon
,
he
fall
down
upon
the
ground
like
a
log
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
minute
,
though
already
frantic
with
drinking
and
with
the
wound
in
his
head
,
he
crawl
to
a
stream
of
burn
spirit
which
be
pour
down
the
kennel
,
and
begin
to
drink
at
it
as
if
it
be
a
brook
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
draw
him
away
,
and
force
him
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
though
he
could
neither
stand
nor
walk
,
he
involuntarily
stagger
to
his
horse
,
climb
upon
his
back
,
and
cling
there
.
 
<EOS>
after
vainly
attempt
to
divest
the
animal
of
his
clank
trapping

Barnaby
spring
up
behind
him
,
snatch
the
bridle
,
turn
into
Leather
Lane
,
which
be
close
at
hand

and
urge
the
frightened
horse
into
a
heavy
trot
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
back
,
once
,
before
he
leave
the
street
;
and
look
upon
a
sight
not
easily
to
be
erase
,
even
from
his
remembrance
,
so
long
as
he
have
life

all

there

down

be
soon
in

He
stop
at
about
half

a

mile
from
the
shed
where
his
father
lie
,
and
with
some
difficulty
make
Hugh
sensible
that
he
must
dismount
,
sunk
the
horse

furniture
in
a
pool
of
stagnant
water
,
and
turn
the
animal
loose

Chapter
69
    
<EOS>
It
be
the
dead
of
night
,
and
very
dark
,
when
Barnaby
,
with
his
stumble
comrade
,
approach
the
place
where
he
have
leave
his
father
;
but
he
could
see
him
steal
away
into
the
gloom
,
distrustful
even
of
him
,
and
rapidly
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
after
call
to
him
twice
or
thrice
that
there
be
nothing
to
fear
,
but
without
effect
,
he
suffer
Hugh
to
sink
upon
the
ground
,
and
follow
to
bring
him
back
.
  
<EOS>
He
continue
to
creep
away
,
until
Barnaby
be
close
upon
him
;
then
turn
,
and
say
in
a
terrible
,
though
suppress
voice
:
  
"
let

<EOS>
do

lay
hand

You

in
silence

"
You

cry
Barnaby

"
  
<EOS>
His

look
upon
him
steadfastly
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
say
---
draw
nearer
to
him
as
he
speak
,
for

see
his

and
hear
his
word
<EOS>
,
it

"

I

he
rejoin
so
fiercely

that
Barnaby
stop
in
his
laugh
,
and
shrink
back
,
survey
him
with
a
look
of
terrified
amazement

<EOS>
"

You

put

with
a
timid
desire
to
propitiate

lay
upon
his
sleeve

I

who

I

the

round

You

You

<EOS>
They
have
by
this
time
return
to
where
he
lie

and
both
stoop
over
him
to
look
into
his
face

<EOS>
"
I

his

murmur

<EOS>
"

say
the
murderer
softly
,
as
he
start
back
a
pace
or
two
,
and
gaze
with
sunken
jaw
and
stare
eye
above
his
son

head

<EOS>
"
at

"
  
<EOS>
He
remain
in
the
same
attitude
and
with
the
same
expression
on
his
face
for
a
minute
or
more
;
then
glance
slowly
round
as
if
he
have
lose
something
;
and
go
shiver
back

towards
the
shed

<EOS>
"
Shall
I

"
<EOS>
ask
Barnaby
,
who
have
look

wonder

<EOS>
He
only
answer
with
a
suppress
groan
,
and
lie
down
upon
the
ground
,
wrap
his
cloak
about
his
head
,
and
shrink
into
the
dark
corner
.
  
<EOS>
find
that
nothing
would
rouse
Hugh
now
,
or
make
him
sensible
for
a
moment
,
Barnaby
drag
him
along
the
grass
,
and
lay
him
on
a
little
heap
of
refuse
hay
and
straw
which
have
be
his
own
bed
;
first
have
bring
some
water
from
a
run
stream
hard
by
,
and
wash
his
wound
,
and
lave
his
hand
and
face
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
lie
down
himself
,
between
the
two
,
to
pass
the
night
;
and
look
at
the
star
,
fall
fast
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
awaken
early
in
the
morning
,
by
the
sunshine
and
the
song
of
bird
,
and
hum
of
insect

he
leave
them
sleep
in
the
hut
,
and
walk
into
the
sweet
and
pleasant
air
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
feel
that
on
his
jade
sense
,
oppress
and
burden
with
the
dreadful
scene
of
last
night
,
and
many
night
before

all
the
beauty
of
open
day
,
which
he
have
so
often
taste
,
and
in
which
he
have
have
such
deep
delight
,
fall
heavily

<EOS>
He
think
of
the
blithe
morning
when
he
and
the
dog
go
bound
on
together
through
the
wood
and
field
;
and
the
recollection
fill
his
eye
with
tear

<EOS>
He
have
no
consciousness

,
God
help
him
,
of
have
do
wrong

nor

any
new
perception

and
regret
,
and
dismal
recollection
,
and
wish
(
quite
unknown
to
him
before
)
that
this
or
that
event
have
never
happen
,
and
that
the
sorrow
and
suffering
of
so
many
people
have
be
spare
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
begin
to
think
how
happy
they
would
be
---
his
father
,
mother
,
he
,
and
Hugh
---
if
they
ramble
away
together
,
and
live
in
some
lonely
place
,
where
there
be
none
of
these
trouble
;
and
that
perhaps
the
blind
man
,
who
have
talk
so
wisely
about
gold
,
and
tell
him
of
the
great
secret
he
know
,
could
teach
them
how
to
live
without
be
pinch
by
want
.
 
<EOS>
as
this
occur
to
him
,
he
be
the
more
sorry
that
he
have
not
see
him
last
night
;
and
he
be
still
brood
over
this
regret
,
when
his
father
come
,
and
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
cry
Barnaby
,
start
from
his
fit
of
thoughtfulness
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
only
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
should
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
almost
think
,
"
he
answer
,
"
it
be
the
blind
man

<EOS>
I
must
have
some
talk
with
him
,
father

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
must
I
,
for
without

him
,
I
do
not
know
where
to
fly
or
what
to
do
,
and
linger
here

be
death

<EOS>
You
must
go
to
him
again
,

bring
him
here

I

Barnaby

that
be
what
I
want
to
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
bring
only
him
,

none
other

<EOS>
and
though
you
wait
at
his
door
a
whole
day
and
night
,
still
you
must
wait
,
and
not
come
back
without
him

"
do
not

he
cry
gaily

He
shall
come

<EOS>
"
trim
off

his

the

the

over
your

heed
how
you
go

they
will
be

busy
in

street
to
notice
you

of

He
be
speedily

,
and
as
well

as
he
could
be

<EOS>
with
a
light
heart
he
then
set
off
upon
his
second
journey
,
leave
Hugh
,
who
be
still
in
a
drunken
stupor
,
stretch
upon
the
ground
within
the
shed
,
and
his
father
walk
to
and
fro
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
murderer
,
full
of
anxious
thought
,
look
after
him
,
and
pace
up
and
down
,
disquiet
by
every
breath
of
air
that
whisper
among
the
bough
,
and
by
every
light
shadow
throw
by
the
pass
cloud
upon
the
daisie
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
for
his
safe
return
,

yet
,
though
his
own
life
and
safety
hang
upon
it
,
feel
a
relief
while
he
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
intense
selfishness
which
the
constant
presence
before
him
of
his
great
crime
,
and
their
consequence
here
and
hereafter
,
engender
,
every
thought
of
Barnaby
,
as
his
son
,
be
swallow
up
and
lose
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
his
presence
be
a
torture
and
reproach
;
in
his
wild
eye
,
there
be
terrible
image
of
that
guilty
night
;
with
his
unearthly
aspect
,
and
his
half
-
form
mind
,
he
seem
to
the
murderer
a
creature
who
have
spring
into
existence
from
his
victim
's
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
his
look
,
his
voice
,
his
touch
;
and
yet
he
be
force
,
by
his
own
desperate
condition
and
his
only
hope
of
cheat
the
gibbet
,
to
have
him
by
his
side
,

to
know
that
he
be
inseparable
from
his
single
chance
of
escape

He
walk
to
and
fro
,
with
little
rest
,
all
day

revolve
these
thing
in
his

say
Hugh

in

sullen
manner
as
before
;

it
may
have
hurt
you

if
you
have
come
in

down

"
  
<EOS>
"
may

hurt
me

"
say
Mr
Dennis
,
still
keep
it
in
his
hand
,
and
feel
the
edge
with
an
air
of
abstraction
.
 
<EOS>
"
may
have

me
exert
myself
all

"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
pass
it
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
raise
it
to
his
lip
,
Barnaby
jump
up
,
and
motion
them
to
be
silent
,
look
eagerly
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter

Barnaby
?
"
say
Dennis
,
glance
at
Hugh
and
drop
the
flask
,
but
still
hold
the
axe
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush

"
<EOS>
he
answer
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
see
glitter
behind
the
hedge

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what

"
cry
the
hangman
,
raise
his
voice
to
its
high
pitch
,
and
lay
hold
of
him
and
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
not

surely
!
"
  
<EOS>
that
moment
,
the
shed
be
fill
with
armed
man
;
and
a
body
of
horse
,
gallop
into
the
field
,
draw
up
before
it

<EOS>
"
there
!
"
say
Dennis
,
who
remain
untouched
among
them
when
they
have
seize
their
prisoner
;
"
it
be
them
two
young

that
the
proclamation

a

<EOS>
this

I
be
sorry
for
it
,
brother
,
"
he
add
,
in
a
tone
of
resignation
,
address
himself
to
Hugh
;
"
but
you
have
bring
it
on
yourself
;
you
force
me
to
do
it
;
you
would
not
respect
the
soundest
constitootional
principle
,
you
know
;
you
go
and
wiolate
the
wery
framework
of
society

<EOS>
I
have
sooner
have
give
away
a
trifle
in
charity
than

I
would
upon
my

if
you
will
keep
fast

I

I
can
make
a
shift

tie
'em
better
than
you
can

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
this
operation
be
postpone
for
a
few
moment
by
a
new
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
the
blind
man
,
whose
ear
be
quick
than
most
people
's
sight
,
have
be
alarm
,
before
Barnaby
,
by
a
rustling
in
the
bush
,
under
cover
of
which
the
soldier
have
advance
.
 
<EOS>
He
retreat
instantly
---
have
hide
somewhere
for
a
minute
---
and
probably
in
his
confusion
mistake
the
point
at
which
he
have
emerge
,
be
now
see
run
across
the
open
meadow
.
  
<EOS>
an
officer
cry
directly
that
he
have
help
to
plunder
a
house
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
loudly
call
on
,
to
surrender
.
 
<EOS>
He
run
the
harder
,
and
in
a
few
second
would
have
be
out
of
gunshot
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
be
give
,
and
the
man
fire
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
breathless
pause
and
a
profound
silence
,
during
which
all
eye
be
fix
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
see
to
start
at
the
discharge
,
as
if
the
report
have
frighten
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
neither
stop
nor
slacken
his
pace
in
the
least
,
and
run
on
full
forty
yard
further
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
without
one
reel
or
stagger
,
or
sign
of
faintness
,
or
quivering
of
any
limb
,
he
drop
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
them
hurry
up
to
where
he
lie
;
---
the
hangman
with
them
.
<EOS>
everything
have
pass
so
quickly
,
that
the
smoke
have
not
yet
scatter
,
but
curl
slowly
off
in
a
little
cloud
,
which
seem
like
the
dead
man
's
spirit
move
solemnly
away
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
few
drop
of
blood
upon
the
grass

<EOS>
more
,
when
they
turn
him
over

that
be
all

<EOS>
"
look

<EOS>
look
here

"
say
the
hangman
,
stoop
one
knee
beside
the
body
,
and
gaze
up
with
a
disconsolate
face
at
the
officer
and
man

<EOS>
"
here
be
a
pretty
sight

"
  
<EOS>
"
stand
out

<EOS>
"
Serjeant

see
what

about

"
  
<EOS>
the
man
turn
his
pocket
out
upon
the
grass
,
and
count
,
besides
some
foreign
coin
and
two
ring
,
five
-
and
-
forty
guinea
in
gold
.
<EOS>
these
be
bundle
up
in
a
handkerchief

the
present

but
six
man
and
the
serjeant
be
leave
to
take
it
to
the
near
public

house

<EOS>
"
now
then
,
if
you
be
go
,
"
say
the
serjeant
,
clap
Dennis
on
the
back
,
and
point
after
the
officer
who
be
walk
towards
the
shed
.
  
<EOS>
to
which
Mr
Dennis
only
reply
,
"
do
not
talk
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
repeat
what
he
have
say
before
,
namely
,
"
here
be
a
pretty
sight
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
one
that
you
care
for
much
,
I
should
think
,
"
observe
the
serjeant
coolly
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
who
,
"
say
Mr
Dennis
rise
,
"
should
care
for
it
,
if
I
do
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
do
not
know
you
be
so
tender

hearted
,
"
say
the
serjeant
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tender

hearted
!
"
echo
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tender
-
hearted
!
 
<EOS>
look
at
this
man
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
call
this
constitootional
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
see
him
shoot
through
and
through
instead
of
be
work
off
like
a
Briton
?
<EOS>
Damme
,
if
I
know
which
party
to
side
with
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
as
bad
as
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
become
of
the
country
if
the
military
power
be
to
go
a
superseding
the
ciwilian
in
this
way
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
this
poor
feller
-
creetur
's
right
as
a
citizen
,
that
he
do
not
have
me
in
his
last
moment
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
willing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
nice
time
,
brother
,
to
have
the
dead
cry
out
against
us
in
this
way
,
and
sleep
comfortably
in
our
bed
arterward
;
wery
nice
!
"
  
<EOS>
whether
he
derive
any
material
consolation
from
bind
the
prisoner
,
be
uncertain
;
most
probably
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
his
be
summon
to
that
work
,
divert
him
,
for
the
time
,
from
these
painful
reflection
,
and
give
his
thought
a
more
congenial
occupation
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
not
all
three
carry
off
together
,
but
in
two
party
;
Barnaby
and
his
father
,
go
by
one
road
in
the
centre
of
a
body
of
foot
;
and
Hugh
,
fast
bind
upon
a
horse
,
and
strongly
guard
by
a
troop
of
cavalry
,
be
take
by
another
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
no
opportunity
for
the
least
communication
,
in
the
short
interval
which
precede
their
departure
;
be
keep
strictly
apart
.
<EOS>
Hugh
only
observe
that
Barnaby
walk
with
a
drooping
head
among
his
guard
,
and
,
without
raise
his
eye
,
that
he
try
to
wave
his
fettered
hand
when
he
pass
.
 
<EOS>
for
himself
,
he
buoy
up
his
courage
as
he
ride
along
,
with
the
assurance
that
the
mob
would
force
his
jail
wherever
it
may
be
,
and
set
him
at
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
they
get
into
London
,
and
more
especially
into
Fleet
Market
,
lately
the
stronghold
of
the
rioter
,
where
the
military
be
root
out
the
last
remnant
of
the
crowd
,
he
see
that
this
hope
be
go
,
and
feel
that
he
be
ride
to
his
death
.

chapter
70
    
Mr
Dennis
have
despatch
this
piece
of
business
without
any
personal
hurt
or
inconvenience
,
and
have
now
retire
into
the
tranquil
respectability
of
private
life
,
resolve
to
solace
himself
with
half
an
hour
or
so
of
female
society
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
amiable
purpose
in
his
mind
,
he
bend
his
step
towards
the
house
where
Dolly
and
Miss
Haredale
be
still
confine
,
and
whither
Miss
Miggs
have
also
be
remove
by
order
of
Mr
Simon
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
walk
along
the
street
with
his
leather
glove
clasp
behind
him
,
and
his
face
indicative
of
cheerful
thought
and
pleasant
calculation
,
Mr
Dennis
may
have
be
liken
unto
a
farmer
ruminating
among
his
crop
,
and
enjoy
by
anticipation
the
bountiful
gift
of
Providence
.
 
<EOS>
look
where
he
would
,
some
heap
of
ruin
afford
him
rich
promise
of
a
working
off
;
the
whole
town
appear
to
have
be
plough
and
sow
,
and
nurture
by
most
genial
weather
;
and
a
goodly
harvest
be
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
have
take
up
arm
and
resort
to
deed
of
violence
,
with
the
great
main
object
of
preserve
the
Old
Bailey
in
all
its
purity
,
and
the
gallow
in
all
its
pristine
usefulness
and
moral
grandeur
,
it
would
perhaps
be
go
too
far
to
assert
that
Mr
Dennis
have
ever
distinctly
contemplate
and
foresee
this
happy
state
of
thing
.
<EOS>
He
rather
look
upon
it
as
one
of
those
beautiful
dispensation
which
be
inscrutably
bring
about
for
the
behoof
and
advantage
of
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
,
as
it
be
,
personally
refer
to
,
in
this
prosperous
ripening
for
the
gibbet
;
and
have
never
consider
himself
so
much
the
pet
and
favourite
child
of
Destiny
,
or
love
that
lady
so
well
or
with
such
a
calm
and
virtuous
reliance
,
in
all
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
be
take
up
,
himself
,
for
a
rioter
,
and
punish
with
the
rest
,
Mr
Dennis
dismiss
that
possibility
from
his
thought
as
an
idle
chimera
;
argue
that
the
line
of
conduct
he
have
adopt
at
Newgate
,
and
the
service
he
have
render
that
day
,
would
be
more
than
a
set
-
off
against
any
evidence
which
may
identify
him
as
a
member
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
that
any
charge
of
companionship
which
may
be
make
against
him
by
those
who
be
themselves
in
danger
,
would
certainly
go
for
nought
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
if
any
trivial
indiscretion
on
his
part
should
unluckily
come
out
,
the
uncommon
usefulness
of
his
office
,
at
present
,
and
the
great
demand
for
the
exercise
of
its
function
,
would
certainly
cause
it
to
be
wink
at
,
and
pass
over
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
have
play
his
card
throughout
,
with
great
care
;
have
change
side
at
the
very
nick
of
time
;
have
deliver
up
two
of
the
most
notorious
rioter
,
and
a
distinguished
felon
to
boot
;
and
be
quite
at
his
ease
.
  
<EOS>
saving
---
for
there
be
a
reservation
;
and
even
Mr
Dennis
be
not
perfectly
happy
---
save
for
one
circumstance
;
to
wit
,
the
forcible
detention
of
Dolly
and
Miss
Haredale
,
in
a
house
almost
adjoin
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
stumbling
-
block
;
for
<EOS>
if
they
be
discover
and
release
,
they
could
,
by
the
testimony
they
have
it
in
their
power
to
give
,
place
him
in
a
situation
of
great
jeopardy
;
and
to
set
them
at
liberty
,
first
extort
from
them
an
oath
of
secrecy
and
silence
<EOS>
,
be
a
thing
not
to
be
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
more
,
perhaps
,
with
an
eye
to
the
danger
which
lurk
in
this
quarter
,
than
from
his
abstract
love
of
conversation
with
the
sex
,
that
the
hangman
,
quicken
his
step
,
now
hasten
into
their
society
,
curse
the
amorous
nature
of
Hugh
and
Mr
Tappertit
with
great
heartiness
,
at
every
step
he
take
.
  
<EOS>
when
be
enter
the
miserable
room
in
which
they
be
confine
,
Dolly
and
Miss
Haredale
withdraw
in
silence
to
the
remote
corner
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Miggs
,
who
be
particularly
tender
of
her
reputation
,
immediately
fall
upon
her
knee
and
begin
to
scream
very
loud
,
cry
,
"

<EOS>

"
have
mercy
,
good
gentleman
,
on
my
sex
's
weakness

"
<EOS>
---
with
other
doleful
lamentation
of
that
nature
,
which
she
deliver
with
great
propriety
and
decorum
.

"

put
upon

Miss

rejoin

with

break

pause
from
excess

<EOS>
that
it
be
not

her

<EOS>
that
man
do
not
see
through

dreadful
art
as
woman
do

therefore
be
cage

trap

as
Simmun
have
be

that
she
have
no

on
the
contrary

her

forasmuch

Simmun

unite

no

miserable

unhappy
for

she
do
incline

prewention

<EOS>
such
,
she
add

be
her

as
this

private

be
look
upon

she
beg
the

with

to
Mr

"

which

ask
Miggs

still
with
her
finger
in
her
ear

her
head
shake
obstinately

<EOS>
"
why
,
the
tall
one

yonder
,
"
say
Dennis
,
as
he
stroke
his
chin
,
and
add
,
in
an
undertone
to
himself
,
something
about
not
cross
Muster
Gashford
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
reply
(
still
be
profoundly
deaf
)
that
if
Miss
Haredale
stand
in
the
way
at
all
,
he
may
make
himself
quite
easy
on
that
score
;
as
she
have
gather
,
from
what
pass
between
Hugh
and
Mr
Tappertit
when
they
be
last
there
,
that
she
be
to
be
remove
alone
(
not
by
them
,
but
by
somebody
else
)
,
to
-
morrow
night
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
open
his
eye
very
wide
at
this
piece
of
information
,
whistle
once
,
consider
once
,
and
finally
slap
his
head
once
and
nod
once
,
as
if
he
have
get
the
clue
to
this
mysterious
removal
,
and
so
dismiss
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
impart
his
design
concern
Dolly
to
Miss
Miggs
,
who
be
take
more
deaf
than
before
,
when
he
begin
;
and
so
remain
,
all
through
.
  
<EOS>
the
notable
scheme
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
be
immediately
to
seek
out
from
among
the
rioter
,
some
dare
young
fellow
(
and
he
have
one
in
his
eye
,
he
say
)
,
who
,
terrify
by
the
threat
he
could
hold
out
to
him
,
and
alarm
by
the
capture
of
so
many
who
be
no
well
and
no
bad
than
he
,
would
gladly
avail
himself
of
any
help
to
get
abroad
,
and
out
of
harm
's
way
,
with
his
plunder
,
even
though
his
journey
be
incumbere
by
an
unwilling
companion
;
indeed
,
the
unwilling
companion
be
a
beautiful
girl
,
would
probably
be
an
additional
inducement
and
temptation
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
person
find
,
he
propose
to
bring
him
there
on
the
ensue
night
,
when
the
tall
one
be
take
off
,
and
Miss
Miggs
have
purposely
retire
;
and
then
that
Dolly
should
be
gag
,
muffle
in
a
cloak
,
and
carry
in
any
handy
conveyance
down
to
the
river
's
side
;
where
there
be
abundant
mean
of
get
her
smuggle
snugly
off
in
any
small
craft
of
doubtful
character
,
and
<EOS>
no
question
ask
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
the
expense
of
this
removal
,
he
would
say
,
at
a
rough
calculation
,
that
two
or
three
silver
tea
or
coffee
-
pot
,
with
something
additional
for
drink
(
such
as
a
muffineer
,
or
toast
-
rack
)
,
would
more
than
cover
it
.
 
<EOS>
article
of
plate
of
every
kind
have
be
bury
by
the
rioter
in
several
lonely
part
of
London
,
and
particularly
,
as
he
know
,
in
St
James
's
Square
,
which
,
though
easy
of
access
,
be
little
frequented
after
dark
,
and
have
a
convenient
piece
of
water
in
the
midst
,
the
needful
fund
be
close
at
hand
,
and
could
be
have
upon
the
short
notice
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
Dolly
,
the
gentleman
would
exercise
his
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
bind
to
do
nothing
but
to
take
her
away
,
and
keep
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
all
other
arrangement
and
disposition
would
rest
entirely
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
if
Miss
Miggs
have
have
her
hearing
,
no
doubt
she
would
have
be
greatly
shock
by
the
indelicacy
of
a
young
female
's
<EOS>
go
away
with
a
stranger
by
night
(
for
her
moral
feeling
,
as
we
have
say
,
be
of
the
tender
kind
)
;
but
directly
Mr
Dennis
cease
to
speak
,
she
remind
him
that
he
have
only
waste
breath
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
go
on
to
say
(
still
with
her
finger
in
her
ear
)
that
nothing
less
than
a
severe
practical
lesson
would
save
the
locksmith
's
daughter
from
utter
ruin
;
and
that
she
feel
it
,
as
it
be
,
a
moral
obligation
and
a
sacred
duty
to
the
family
,
to
wish
that
some
one
would
devise
one
for
her
reformation
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
remark
,
and
very
justly
,
as
an
abstract
sentiment
which
happen
to
occur
to
her
at
the
moment
,
that
she
dare
to
say
the
locksmith
and
his
wife
would
murmur
,
and
repine
,
if
they
be
ever
,
by
forcible
abduction
,
or
otherwise
,
to
lose
their
child
;
but
that
we
seldom
know
,
in
this
world
,
what
be
good
for
us
:
<EOS>
such
be
our
sinful
and
imperfect
nature
,
that
very
few
arrive
at
that
clear
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
have
bring
their
conversation
to
this
satisfactory
end
,
they
part
:
Dennis
,
to
pursue
his
design
,
and
take
another
walk
about
his
farm
;
Miss
Miggs
,
to
launch
,
when
he
leave
her
,
into
such
a
burst
of
mental
anguish
(
which
she
give
them
to
understand
be
occasion
by
certain
tender
thing
he
have
have
the
presumption
and
audacity
to
say
)
,
that
little
Dolly
's
heart
be
quite
melted
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
say
and
do
so
much
to
soothe
the
outraged
feeling
of
Miss
Miggs
,
and
look
so
beautiful
while
do
so
,
that
if
that
young
maid
have
not
have
ample
vent
for
her
surpassing
spite
,
in
a
knowledge
of
the
mischief
that
be
brew

she
must
have
scratch
her
feature
,
on
the
spot

Chapter
71
    
<EOS>
all
next
day
,
Emma
Haredale
,
Dolly
,
and
Miggs
,
remain
coope
up
together
in
what
have
now
be
their
prison
for
so
many
day
,
without
see
any
person
,
or
hear
any
sound
but
the
murmur
conversation
,
in
an
outer
room
,
of
the
man
who
keep
watch
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
appear
to
be
more
of
these
fellow
than
there
have
be
hitherto
;
and
they
could
no
longer
hear
the
voice
of
woman
,
which
they
have
before
plainly
distinguished
.
 
<EOS>
some
new
excitement
,
too
,
seem
to
prevail
among
them
;
for
there
be
much
stealthy
go
in
and
out
,
and
a
constant
questioning
of
those
who
be
newly
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
previously
be
quite
reckless
in
their
behaviour
;
often
make
a
great
uproar
;
quarrel
among
themselves
,
fight
,
dancing
,
and
singing
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
now
very
subdued
and
silent
,
converse
almost
in
whisper
,
and
steal
in
and
out
with
a
soft
and
stealthy
tread
,
very
different
from
the
boisterous
trampling
<EOS>
in
which
their
arrival
and
departure
have
hitherto
be
announce
to
the
tremble
captive
.
  
<EOS>
whether
this
change
be
occasion
by
the
presence
among
them
of
some
person
of
authority
in
their
rank
,
or
by
any
other
cause
,
they
be
unable
to
decide
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
think
it
be
in
part
attributable
to
there
be
a
sick
man
in
the
chamber
,
<EOS>
for
last
night
there
have
be
a
shuffling
of
foot
,
as
though
a
burden
be
bring
in
,
and
afterwards
a
moan
noise
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
have
no
means
of
ascertain
the
truth
:
for
any
question
or
entreaty
on
their
part
only
provoke
a
storm
of
execration
,
or
something
bad

It

sufficiently
evident

both
to

poor
little

herself

that
she

Dolly

leisure

indulge
in
the
soft

Hugh

Mr

certainly
fall

<EOS>
She
have
little
comfort
to
impart

but
she
could
soothe
and
tend
her
,
and
she
do
so
;
and
dolly
clung
to

like
a

to
its

<EOS>
in
endeavour
to
inspire
her
with
some
fortitude
,
she
increase
her
own
;
and
though
the
night
be
long
,
and
the
day
dismal
,
and
she
feel
the
waste
influence
of
watching
and
fatigue
,
and
have
perhaps
a
more
defined
and
clear
perception
of
their
destitute
condition

its
bad
danger
<EOS>
,
she
utter
no
complaint

<EOS>
before
the
ruffian

in
whose
power
they

she
bear
herself
so
calmly
,
and
with
such
an
appearance
,
in
the
midst
of
all
her
terror
,
of
a
secret
conviction
that
they
dare
not
harm
her
,
that
there
be
not
a
man
among
them
but
hold
her
in
some
degree
of
dread
;
and
more
than
one
believe
she
have
a
weapon
hide
in
her
dress
,
and
be
prepared
to
use
it
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
their
condition
when
they
be
join
by
Miss
Miggs
,
who
give
them
to
understand
that
she
too
have
be
take
prisoner
because
of
her
charm
,
and
detail
such
feat
of
resistance
she
have
perform
(
her
virtue
have
give
her
supernatural
strength
)
,
that
they
feel
it
quite
a
happiness
to
have
her
for
a
champion
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
the
only
comfort
they
derive
at
first
from
Miggs
's
presence
and
society
:
for
that
young
lady
display
such
resignation
and
long
-
suffer
,
and
so
much
meek
endurance
,
under
her
trial
,
and
breathe
in
all
her
chaste
discourse
a
spirit
of
such
holy
confidence
and
resignation
,
and
devout
belief
that
all
would
happen
for
the
good
,
that
Emma
feel
her
courage
strengthen
by
the
bright
example
;
never
doubt
but
that
everything
she
say
be
true
,
and
that
she
,
like
them
,
be
tear
from
all
she
love
,
and
agonise
by
doubt
and
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
poor
Dolly
,
she
be
rouse
,
at
first
,
by
see
one
who
come
from
home
;
but
when
she
hear
under
what
circumstance
she
have
leave
it
,
and
into
whose
hand
her
father
have
fall
,
she
weep
more
bitterly
than
ever
,
and
refuse
all
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
be
at
some
trouble
to
reprove
her
for
this
state
of
mind
,
and
to
entreat
her
to
take
example
by
herself
,
who
,
she
say
,
be
now
receive
back
,
with
interest
,
tenfold
the
amount
of
her
subscription
to
the
red

brick
dwelling

house
,
in
the
article
of
peace
of
mind
and
a
quiet
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
while
on
serious
topic
,
Miss
Miggs
consider
it
her
duty
to
try
her
hand
at
the
conversion
of
Miss
Haredale
;
for
whose
improvement
she
launch
into
a
polemical
address
of
some
length
,
in
the
course
whereof
,
she
liken
herself
unto
a
choose
missionary
,
and
that
young
lady
to
a
cannibal
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
return
so
often
to
these
sublect
,
and
so
frequently
call
upon
them
to
take
a
lesson
from
her
,
---
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
vaunt
and
,
as
it
be
,
riot
in
,
her
huge
unworthiness
,
and
abundant
excess
of
sin
,
---
that
,
in
the
course
of
a
short
time
,
she
become
,
in
that
small
chamber
,
rather
a
nuisance
than
a
comfort
,
and
render
them
,
if
possible
,
even
more
unhappy
than
they
have
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
have
now
come
;
and
for
the
first
time
(
for
their
jailer
have
be
regular
in
bring
food
and
candle
)
,
they
be
leave
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
any
change
in
their
condition
in
such
a
place
inspire
new
fear
;
and
when
some
hour
have
pass
,
and
the
gloom
be
still
unbroken
,
Emma
could
no
longer
repress
her
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
They
listen
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
murmuring
in
the
outer
room
,
and
now
and
then
a
moan
which
seem
to
be
wring
from
a
person
in
great
pain
,
who
make
an
effort
to
subdue
it
,
but
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
even
these
man
seem
to
be
in
darkness
too
;
for
no
light
shine
through
the
chink
in
the
door
,
nor
be
they
move
,
as
their
custom
be
,
but
quite
still
:
the
silence
be
unbroken
by
so
much
as
the
creaking
of
a
board
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
Miss
Miggs
wonder
greatly
in
her
own
mind
who
this
sick
person
may
be
;
but
arrive
,
on
second
thought
,
at
the
conclusion
that
he
be
a
part
of
the
scheme
on
foot
,
and
an
artful
device
soon
to
be
employ
with
great
success
,
she
opine
,
for
Miss
Haredale
's
comfort
,
that
it
must
be
some
misguided
papist
who
have
be
wound
:
and
this
happy
supposition
encourage
her
to
say
,
under
her
breath
,
"

several

<EOS>
"

It

repeat

the
Black
Lion
,
who
,
like
old
John
,
have
be
wait
supper
past
all
reasonable
and
conscionable
hour
,
hail
this
as
a
philosophical
discovery
of
the
profound
and
most
penetrate
kind
;
and
the
table
be
already
spread
,
they
sit
down
to
supper
straightway
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
be
not
of
the
lively
nature
,
nor
be
the
appetite
of
some
among
them
very
keen
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
both
these
respect
,
old
John
more
than
atone
for
any
deficiency
on
the
part
of
the
rest
,
and
very
much
distinguish
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
point
of
actual
conversation
that
Mr
Willet
shine
so
brilliantly
,
for
he
have
none
of
his
old
crony
to
"
tackle
,
"
and
be
rather
timorous
of
venture
on
Joe
;
have
certain
vague
misgiving
within
him
,
that
he
be
ready
on
the
short
notice
,
and
on
receipt
of
the
slight
offence
,
to
fall
the
Black
Lion
to
the
floor
of
his
own
parlour
,
and
immediately
to
withdraw
to
China
or
some
other
remote
and
unknown
region
,
there
to
dwell
for
evermore
,
or
at
least
until
he
have
get
rid
of
his
remain
arm
and
both
leg
,
and
perhaps
an
eye
or
so
,
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
pantomime
that
Mr
Willet
fill
up
every
pause
;
and
in
this
he
be
consider
by
the
Black
Lion
,
who
have
be
his
familiar
for
some
year
,
quite
to
surpass
and
go
beyond
himself
,
and
outrun
the
expectation
of
his
most
admiring
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
that
work
in
Mr
Willet
's
mind
,
and
occasion
these
demonstration
,
be
no
other
than
his
son
's
bodily
disfigurement
,
which
he
have
never
yet
get
himself
thoroughly
to
believe
,
or
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
shortly
after
their
first
meeting
,
he
have
be
observe
to
wander
,
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
,
to
the
kitchen
,
and
to
direct
his
gaze
towards
the
fire
,
as
if
in
search
of
his
usual
adviser
in
all
matter
of
doubt
and
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
boiler
at
the
Black
Lion
,
and
the
rioter
have
so
beat
and
batter
his
own
that
it
be
quite
unfit
for
further
service
<EOS>
,
he
wander
out
again
,
in
a
perfect
bog
of
uncertainty
and
mental
confusion
,
and
in
that
state
take
the
strange
mean
of
resolve
his
doubt
:
such
as
feel
the
sleeve
of
his
son
's
greatcoat
as
deem
it
possible
that
his
arm
may
be
there
;
look
at
his
own
arm
and
those
of
everybody
else
,
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
two
and
not
one
be
the
usual
allowance
;
sit
by
the
hour
together
in
a
brown
study
,
as
if
he
be
endeavour
to
recall
Joe
's
image
in
his
young
day
,
and
to
remember
whether
he
really
have
in
those
time
one
arm
or
a
pair
;
and
employ
himself
in
many
other
speculation
of
the
same
kind
.
  
<EOS>
find
himself
at
this
supper
,
surround
by
face
with
which
he
have
be
so
well
acquaint
in
old
time
,
Mr
Willet
recur
to
the
subject
with
uncommon
vigour
;
apparently
resolve
to
understand
it
now
or
never
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
after
every
two
or
three
mouthful
,
he
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
stare
at
his
son
with
all
his
might
---
particularly
at
his
maimed
side
;
then
,
he
look
slowly
round
the
table
until
he
catch
some
person
's
eye
,
when
he
shake
his
head
with
great
solemnity
,
pat
his
shoulder
,
wink
,
or
as
one
may
say
---
for
winking
be
a
very
slow
process
with
him
---
go
to
sleep
with
one
eye
for
a
minute
or
two
;
and
so
,
with
another
solemn
shaking
of
his
head
,
take
up
his
knife
and
fork
again
,
and
go
on
eat
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
he
put
his
food
into
his
mouth
abstractedly
,
and
,
with
all
his
faculty
concentrate
on
Joe
,
gaze
at
him
in
a
fit
of
stupefaction
as
he
cut
his
meat
with
one
hand
,
until
he
be
recall
to
himself
by
symptom
of
choke
on
his
own
part
,
and
be
by
that
mean
restore
to
consciousness
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
he
resort
to
such
small
device
as
ask
him
for
the
salt
,
the
pepper
,
the
vinegar
,
the
mustard
---
anything
that
be
on
his
maimed
side
---
and
watch
him
as
he
hand
it
.
 
<EOS>
by
dint
of
these
experiment
,
he
do
at
last
so
satisfy
and
convince
himself
,
that
,
after
a
long
silence
than
he
have
yet
maintain
,
he
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
on
either
side
his
plate
,
drank
a
long
draught
from
a
tankard
beside
him
(
still
keep
his
eye
on
Joe
)
,
and
lean
backward
in
his
chair
and
fetch
a
long
breath
,
say
,
as
he
look
all
round
the
board
:

Mr

empty
sleeve
all
the
way
up
,
from
the
cuff

to
where
the
stump
of
his

shake

hand
;
light
his
pipe
at

fire
,
take

long
whiff
,
walk

turn
round
once
when

have
reach

,
wipe
his
left
eye
with
the
back
of

and
say
,
in
a
falter
voice
:

it

He

offer
to

to
pacify

with
the
somewhat
indefinite
assurance
that

this

which

if
it

nor

very
bold

fierce

He

he

all

in

doze
sometimes
,
and
sometimes
look
at
the
light
that
creep
in
through
the
bar

shine
in

eye
as

a

Barnaby

withdraw
his

from

lay
it
upon
his
mother

arm
,

he
look
eagerly
in

<EOS>
the
sound
of
the

the
current
of
his
own
thought
,
suggest
to
Grip
his
old
phrase
"
never

<EOS>
but
he
stop
short
in
the
middle
of
it
,
draw
a
dismal
cork

faint
croak

come

him

She

He

to

spot

himself
,

on

the
moon
come
slowly
up
in
all
her
gentle
glory
,
and
the
star
look
out
,
and
through
the
small
compass
of
the
grate
window
,
as
through
the
narrow
crevice
of
one
good
deed
in
a
murky
life
of
guilt

face

Heaven
shine
bright

He
raise
his

gaze
upward
at
the
quiet
sky

to
smile
upon
the

in
sadness

the
night

more
thoughtful
than

day

look
down
in
sorrow
on
the
suffering
and
evil
deed
of
man

feel
its
peace
sink
deep
into
his
heart

He

cage
in

gaze
on

mild
light

the
free
and
most
favoured
man
in

the
spacious
city

in
his
ill
-
remember
prayer

the
fragment
of
the
childish
hymn

with
which
he
sing

himself
asleep

breathe
as
true
a

deaf

Chapter
74
    
Me
Dennis
,
have
be
make
prisoner
late
in
the
evening
,
be
remove
to
a
neighbouring
round
-
house
for
that
night
,
and
carry
before
a
justice
for
examination
on
the
next
day
,
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
the
charge
against
him
be
numerous
and
weighty
,
and
it
be
in
particular
prove
,
by
the
testimony
of
Gabriel
Varden
,
that
he
have
show
a
special
desire
to
take
his
life
,
he
be
commit
for
trial
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
he
be
honour
with
the
distinction
of
be
consider
a
chief
among
the
insurgent
,
and
receive
from
the
magistrate
's
lip
the
complimentary
assurance
that
he
be
in
a
position
of
imminent
danger
,
and
would
do
well
to
prepare
himself
for
the
bad
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
that
Mr
Dennis
's
modesty
be
not
somewhat
startled
by
these
honour
,
or
that
he
be
altogether
prepared
for
so
flatter
a
reception
,
would
be
to
claim
for
him
a
great
amount
of
stoical
philosophy
than
even
he
possess
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
this
gentleman
's
stoicism
be
of
that
not
uncommon
kind
,
which
enable
a
man
to
bear
with
exemplary
fortitude
the
affliction
of
his
friend
,
but
render
him
,
by
way
of
counterpoise
,
rather
selfish
and
sensitive
in
respect
of
any
that
happen
to
befall
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
no
disparagement
to
the
great
officer
in
question
to
state
,
without

emotion

come

a

in

these

his
good

off
handsomely
and
with
small
personal
inconvenience
,
his
spirit
rise
,
and
his
confidence
increase
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
remember
the
great
estimation
in
which
his
office
be
hold
,
and
the
constant
demand
for
his
service
;
when
he
bethink
himself
,
how
the
Statute
Book
regard
him
as
a
kind
of
Universal
Medicine
applicable
to
man
,
woman
,

of

how
high

in

official
capacity

in
the
favour
of
the
Crown
,
and
both
Houses
of
Parliament
,
the
Mint
,
the
Bank
of
England
,
and
the
Judges
of
the

;
when
he
recollect
that
whatever
Ministry
be
in
or
out
,
he
remain
their
peculiar
pet
and
panacea
,
and
that
for
his
sake
England
stand
single
and
conspicuous
among
the
civilised
nation
of
the
earth
:
when
he
call
these
thing
to
mind
and
dwelt
upon
them
,
he
feel
certain
that
the
national
gratitude
MUST
relieve
him
from
the
consequence
of
his
late
proceeding
,
and
would
certainly
restore
him
to
his
old
place
in
the
happy
social

<EOS>
with
these
crumb

Mr
Dennis
take
his
place
among
the
escort

await
him
,
and
repair
to
jail
with
a
manly
indifference

in

tremulous

his

<EOS>
the
officer
seem
to
entertain
no

desire
on
the
subject
one
way
or
other
,
but
briefly
remark
that
he
have
his
order
,
and
intend
to
obey
them
,
push
him
in
,
turn
the
key
,
and
retire
.
  
<EOS>
Dennis
stand
tremble
with
his
back
against
the
door
,
and
involuntarily
raise
his
arm
to
defend
himself
,
stare
at
a
man
,
the
only
other
tenant
of
the
cell
,
who
lie
,
stretch
at
his
fall
length
,
upon
a
stone
bench
,
and
who
pause
in
his
deep
breathing
as
if
he
be
about
to
wake
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
roll
over
on
one
side
,
let
his
arm
fall
negligently
down
,
draw
a
long
sigh
,
and
murmur
indistinctly
,
fall
fast
asleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
relieve
in
some
degree
by
this
,
the
hangman
take
his
eye
for
an
instant
from
the
slumbering
figure
,
and
glance
round
the
cell
in
search
of
some
"
vantage
-
ground
or
weapon
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
moveable
within
it
,
but
a
clumsy
table
which
could
not
be
displace
without
noise
,
and
a
heavy
chair
.
 
<EOS>
steal
on
tiptoe
towards
this
latter
piece
of
furniture
,
he
retire
with
it
into
the
remote
corner

intrench
himself
behind
it
,
watch
the
enemy
with
the
utmost
vigilance
and
caution
.
  
<EOS>
the
sleep
man
be
Hugh
;
and
perhaps
it
be
not
unnatural
for
Dennis
to
feel
in
a
state
of
very
uncomfortable
suspense
,
and
to
wish
with
his
whole
soul
that
he
may
never
wake
again
.
 
<EOS>
tired
of
standing
,
he
crouch
down
in
his
corner
after
some
time
,
and
rest
on
the
cold
pavement
;
but
although
Hugh
's
breathing
still
proclaim
that
he
be
sleep
soundly
,
he
could
not
trust
him
out
of
his
sight
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
afraid
of
him
,
and
of
some
sudden
onslaught
,
that
he
be
not
content
to
see
his
close
eye
through
the
chair
-
back
,
but
every
now
and
then
,
rise
stealthily
to
his
foot
,
and
peer
at
him
with
outstretched
neck
,
to
assure
himself
that
he
really
be
still
asleep
,
and
be
not
about
to
spring
upon
him
when
he
be
off
his
guard
.
  
<EOS>
He
sleep
so
long
and
<EOS>
so
soundly
,
that
Mr
Dennis
begin
to
think
he
may
sleep
on
until
the
turnkey
visit
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
congratulate
himself
upon
these
promising
appearance
,
and
bless
his
star
with
much
fervour
,
when
one
or
two
unpleasant
symptom
manifest
themselves
:
such
as
another
motion
of
the
arm
,
another
sigh
,
a
restless
tossing
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
just
as
it
seem
that
he
be
about
to
fall
heavily
to
the
ground
from
his
narrow
bed
,
Hugh
's
eye
open
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
his
face
be
turn
directly
towards
his
unexpected
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
lazily
at
him
for
some
half
-
dozen
second
without
any
aspect
of
surprise
or
recognition
;
then
suddenly
jump
up
,
and
with
a
great
oath
pronounce
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
keep
off
,
brother
,
keep
off
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Dennis
,
dodge
behind
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"

me
a

<EOS>
He
whine
out
the
last
three
word
in
such
piteous
accent
,
that
Hugh
,
who
have
drag
away
the
chair
,
and
aim
a
blow
at
him
with
it
,
check
himself
,
and
bade
him
get
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

cry
Dennis
,
anxious
to
propitiate
him
by
any
mean
in
his
power

cry
Hugh
,
clutch
him
by
the
collar
with
both
hand
,
and
shake
him
as
though
he
be
bent
on
stop
his
breath
by
that
mean

you

the
good

<EOS>
the
good

"
return
the
hangman
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
make
him
no
answer
,
but
shake
him
in
his
strong
grip
until
his
tooth
chatter
in
his
head
,
cast
him
down
upon
the
floor
,
and
fling
himself
on
the
bench
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
it

I

have
crush
your

I

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
Dennis
have
breath
enough
to
speak
,
but
as
soon
as
he
could
resume
his
propitiatory
strain
,
he
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
the
good

he
whine
;

<EOS>
"
Will
it
be
a
well
sight
now

"
<EOS>
ask
Hugh
,
raise
his
head
,
with
such
a
fierce
expression
,
that
the
other
durst
not
answer
him
just
then

<EOS>
"
a

well

Dennis
meekly
,
after
a
pause

and
his
nature
so
revolt
at
the
bare
idea
,
that
he
spit
upon
the
dungeon
pavement
.
  
<EOS>
His
warming
on
this
topic
,
which
to
one
unacquainted
with
his
pursuit
and
taste
appear
like
courage
;
together
with
his
artful
suppression
of
his
own
secret
hope
,
and
mention
of
himself
as
be
in
the
same
condition
with
Hugh
;
do
more
to
soothe
that
ruffian
than
the
most
elaborate
argument

have
do
,
or
the
most
abject
submission

<EOS>
He
rest
his
arm
upon
his
knee
,
and
stoop
forward
,
look
from
beneath
his
shaggy
hair
at
Dennis
,
with
something
of
a
smile
upon
his
face

his

upon

the

suggest
sudden
recollection
of
thing
distant

long

and
remote
from

other

the
vague
restless
craving
for
something
undefined
,
which
nothing

satisfy
---
the
swift
flight
of
the
minute
,
fuse
themselves
into
hour
,
as
if
by
enchantment

the
rapid
coming
of
the
solemn
night
---
the
shadow
of
death
always
upon
them
,
and
yet
so
dim
and
faint
,
that
object
the
mean
and
most
trivial
start
from
the
gloom
beyond
,
and
force
themselves
upon
the
view

the
impossibility

the

even
if
they

so
disposed

to
penitence

hideous

with
every
chime
of
St
Sepulchre
's
clock
,
for
twelve
at
noon
.
  
<EOS>
up
to
this
time
they
have
be
very
quiet
,
comparatively
silent
,
save
when
the
arrival
of
some
new
party
at
a
window
,
hitherto
unoccupied
,
give
them
something
new
to
look
at
or
to
talk
of
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
hour
approach
,
a
buzz
and
hum
arise
,
which
,
deepen
every
moment
,
soon
swell
into
a
roar
,
and
seem
to
fill
the
air
.
<EOS>
no
word
or
even
voice
could
be
distinguish
in
this
clamour
,
nor
do
they
speak
much
to
each
other
;
though
such
as
be
better
inform
upon
the
topic
than
the
rest
,
would
tell
their
neighbour
,
perhaps
,
that
they
may
know
the
hangman
when
he
come
out
,
by
his
be
the
short
one
:
and
that
the
man
who
be
to
suffer
with
him
be
name
Hugh
:
and
that
it
be
Barnaby
Rudge
who
would
be
hang
in
Bloomsbury
Square
.
  
<EOS>
the
hum
grow
,
as
the
time
draw
near
,
so
loud
,
that
those
who
be
at
the
window
could
not
hear
the
church
-
clock
strike
,
though
it
be
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
they
any
need
to
hear
it
,
either
,
for
they
could
see
it
in
the
people
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
so
surely
as
another
quarter
chime
,
there
be
a
movement
in
the
crowd
---
as
if
something
have
pass
over
it
---
as
if
the
light
upon
them
have
be
change
---
in
which
the
fact
be
readable
as
on
a
brazen
dial
,
figure
by
a
giant
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
three
quarter
past
eleven
!
 
<EOS>
the
murmur
now
be
deafen
,
yet
every
man
seem
mute
.
 
<EOS>
look
where
you
would
among
the
crowd
,
you
see
strained
eye
and
lip
compress
;
it
would
have
be
difficult
for
the
most
vigilant
observer
to
point
this
way
or
that
,
and
say
that
yonder
man
have
cry
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
easy
to
detect
the
motion
of
lip
in
a
sea
-
shell
.
  
<EOS>
three
quarter
past
eleven
!
 
<EOS>
many
spectator
who
have
retire
from
the
window
,
come
back
refresh
,
as
though
their
watch
have
just
begin
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
have
fall
asleep
,
rouse
themselves
;
and
every
person
in
the
crowd
make
one
last
effort
to
better
his
position
---
 
which
cause
a
press
against
the
sturdy
barrier
that
make
them
bend
and
yield
like
twig
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
,
who
until
now
have
keep
together
,
fall
into
their
several

and
give
the

of

<EOS>
sword

musket

,
and
the
bright
steel
wind
its
way
among
the
crowd
,
gleam
and
glitter
in
the
sun
like
a
river
.
 
<EOS>
along
this

,
two
man
come

on
,
lead
a
horse
,
which
be
speedily
harness
to
the

at
the

<EOS>
then
,
a
profound
silence
replace
the
tumult
that
have
so
long
be
gather
,
and
a
breathless
pause
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
every
window
be
now
choke
up

the
house

top
teem
with
people

cling
to
chimney
,
peer
over

and

on
where
the
sudden
loosening
of
any
brick

dash
them
down
into

<EOS>
the

the

,
the

the

every

<EOS>
at
the
first
stroke
of
twelve
the
prison

to

<EOS>
then
the
roar

mingle
now
with
cry
of
"
hat
off

"
and
"
poor
fellow

"
<EOS>
and
,
from
some
speck
in
the
great
concourse
,
with
a
shriek
or
groan
---
burst
forth
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
terrible
to
see
---
if
any
one
in
that
distraction
of
excitement
could
have
see
---
the
world
of
eager
eye
,
all
strain
upon
the
scaffold
and
the
beam
.
  
<EOS>
the
hollow
murmuring
be
hear
within
the
jail
as
plainly
as
without

<EOS>
the
three
be
bring
forth
into
the

together

as
it

through

They

its

well

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
cry
Hugh
,
undaunte
by
the
sound

<EOS>
"
They

<EOS>
I
hear
them
gather
when
I
wake
in
the
night
,
and
turn
over
on
t'other
side
and
fall
asleep
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
how
they
welcome
the
hangman

now
that
it
come
home
to
him

"
  
<EOS>
the
Ordinary
come
up
at
this
moment
,
reprove
him
for
his
indecent
mirth
,
and
advise
him
to
alter
his
demeanour

"
<EOS>
and
why

say
Hugh

Can

I

if

there
be
one
that
will
suit
you

<EOS>
try
your

"
  
<EOS>
He
point
,
as
he
speak
,
to
Dennis
,
who
,
with
his
leg
trail
on
the
ground
,
be
hold
between
two
man

and
who
tremble
so
,
that
all
his
joint

limb
seem
rack
by

<EOS>
turn
from

wretched

stand
apart

Will

"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
gaze
for
a
moment
at
his
face
,
on
which
there
be
a
strange
,
unearthly
smile
;
and
at
his
eye
,
which
sparkle
brightly
;
and
interpose
between
him
and
the
ordinary
,
gruffly
whisper
to
the
latter
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
say
much
to
him
,
master
,
if
I
be
you

<EOS>
He
may
spoil
your
appetite
for
breakfast
,
though
you
are
used

it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
one
of
the
three
who
have
wash
or
trim
himself
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
neither
of
the
other
have
do
so
,
since
their
doom
be
pronounce
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
wear
the
broken
peacock
's
feather
in
his
hat
;
and
all
his
usual
scrap
of
finery
be
carefully
disposed
about
his
person
.
 
<EOS>
His
kindle
eye
,
his
firm
step
,
his
proud
and
resolute
bearing
,
may
have
grace
some
lofty
act
of
heroism
;
some
voluntary
sacrifice
,
bear
of
a
noble
cause
and
pure
enthusiasm
;
rather
than
that
felon
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
these
thing
increase
his
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
mere
assumption
.
 
<EOS>
the
law
have
declare
it
so
,
and
so
it
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
minister
have
be
greatly
shock
,
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
,
at
his
parting
with
Grip
.
 
<EOS>
for
one
in
his
condition
,
to
fondle
a
bird
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
the
yard
be
fill
with
people
;
bluff
civic
functionary
,
officer
of
justice
,
soldier
,
the
curious
in
such
matter
,
and
guest
who
have
be
bid
as
to
a
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
look
about
him
,
nod
gloomily
to
some
person
in
authority
,
who
indicate
with
his
hand
in
what
direction
he
be
to
proceed
;
and
clap
Barnaby
on
the
shoulder
,
pass
out
with
the
gait
of
a
lion
.
  
<EOS>
They
enter
a
large
room
,
so
near
to
the
scaffold
that
the
voice
of
those
who
stand
about
it
,
could
be
plainly
hear
:
some
beseech
the
javelin
-
man
to
take
them
out
of
the
crowd
:
other
cry
to
those
behind
,
to
stand
back
,
for
they
be
press
to
death
,
and
suffocate
for
want
of
air
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
this
chamber
,
two
smith
,
with
hammer
,
stand
beside
an
anvil
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
walk
straight
up
to
them
,
and
set
his
foot
upon
it
with
a
sound
as
though
it
have
be
strike
by
a
heavy
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
fold
arm
,
he
stand
to
have
his
iron
knock
off
:
<EOS>
scowl
haughtily
round
,
as
those
who
be
present
eyed
him
narrowly
and
whisper
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
take
so
much
time
to
drag
Dennis
in
,
that
this
ceremony
be
over
with
Hugh
,
and
nearly
over
with
Barnaby
,
before
he
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
come
into
the
place
he
know
so
well

however
,
and
among
face
with
which
he
be
so
familiar
,
than
he
recover
strength
and
sense
enough
to
clasp
his
hand
and
make
a
last
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
"
gentleman
,
good
gentleman

"
cry
the
abject
creature
,
grovel
down
upon
his
knee
,
and
actually
prostrate
himself
upon
the
stone
floor
:
"

to

he
could
he
hear
above
the
clinking
of

smith

hammer

how

strange

some

It
be
a

exquisite
satire
upon

false

lead

so
much
misery
,
that
some

Chapter

<EOS>
on
this
same
day
,
and
about
this
very
hour
,
Mr
Willet
the
elder
sit
smoke
his
pipe
in
a
chamber
at
the
Black
Lion
.
 
<EOS>
although
it
be
hot
summer
weather
,
Mr
Willet
sit
close
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
state
of
profound
cogitation
,
with
his
own
thought
,
and
it
be
his
custom
at
such
time
to
stew
himself
slowly
,
under
the
impression
that
that
process
of
cookery
be
favourable
to
the
melting
out
of
his
idea
,
which
,
when
he
begin
to
simmer
,
sometimes
ooze
forth
so
copiously
as
to
astonish
even
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
have
be
several
thousand
time
comfort
by
his
friend
and
acquaintance
,
with
the
assurance
that
for
the
loss
he
have
sustain
in
the
damage
do
to
the
Maypole
,
he
could
"
come
upon
the
county
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
as
this
phrase
happen
to
bear
an
unfortunate
resemblance
to
the
popular
expression
of
"
come
on
the
parish
,
"
it
suggest
to
Mr
Willet
's
mind
no
more
consolatory
vision
than
pauperism
on
an
extensive
scale
,
and
ruin
in
a
capacious
aspect
.
<EOS>
consequently
,
he
have
never
fail
to
receive
the
intelligence
with
a
rueful
shake
of
the
head
,
or
a
dreary
stare
,
and
have
be
always
observe
to
appear
much
more
melancholy
after
a
visit
of
condolence
than
at
any
other
time
in
the
whole
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
.
  
<EOS>
It
chance
,
however
,
that
sit
over
the
fire
on
this
particular
occasion
---
perhaps
because
he
be
,
as
it
be
,
do
to
a
turn
;
perhaps
because
he
be
in
an
unusually
bright
state
of
mind
;
perhaps
because
he
have
consider
the
subject
so
long
;
perhaps
because
of
all
these
favour
circumstance
,
take
together
---
it
chance
that
,
sit
over
the
fire
on
this
particular
occasion
,
Mr
Willet
do
,
afar
off
and
in
the
remote
depth
of
his
intellect
,
perceive
a
kind
of
lurk
hint
or
faint
suggestion
,
that
out
of
the
public
purse
there
may
issue
fund
for
the
restoration
of
the
Maypole
to
its
former
high
place
among
the
tavern
of
the
earth

<EOS>
and
this
dim
ray
of
light
do
so
diffuse
itself
within
him
,
and
do
so
kindle
up
and
shine
,
that
at
last
he
have
it
as
plainly
and
visibly
before
him
as
the
blaze
by
which
he
sit
;
and
,
fully
persuade
that
he
be
the
first
to
make
the
discovery
,
and
that
he
have
start
,
hunt
down
,
fall
upon
,
and
knock
on
the
head
,
a
perfectly
original
idea
which
have
never
present
itself
to
any
other
man
,
alive
or
dead

he
lay
down
his

rub
his

a

after

again

this

,
and
meeting
in
the
course
of
the
late
trouble
,
have
be
a
good
thing
every
way
;
for
it
have
not
only
enable
us
to
do
old
friend
some
service
,
but
have
open
a
path
in
life
for
me
which
I
may
tread
without
be
a
burden
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
plain
,
father
,
he
can
employ
me
;
I
have
satisfy
myself
that
I
can
be
of
real
use
to
him
;
and
I
be
go
to
carry
my
one
arm
away
with
him
,
and
to
make
the
most
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mind

perpetually

flourish
tomahawk

puncture
strange

their

<EOS>
He
no
sooner
hear
this
announcement
,
therefore
,
than
he
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
take
his
pipe
from
his
lip
,
and
stare
at
his
son
with
as
much
dismay
as
if
he
already
behold
him
tie
to
a
stake
,
and
torture
for
the
entertainment
of
a
lively
population

<EOS>
in
what
form
of
expression
his
feeling
would
have
find
a
vent
,
it
be
impossible
to
say

nor
be
it
necessary

Dolly

run
into
the

,
in
tear

herself
on
Joe

breast
without

her

<EOS>
Joe
could
only
repeat
his

it
be
very
much
to
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
They

what
Joe

a
great
deal

Dolly
say
a
great

he
fold
Dolly

pretty
tight

no

not
an
utterly
miserable

we
may
,
with
some
appearance
of
certainty
,
conclude
that
they
be

<EOS>
to
say
that
during
these
proceeding
Mr
Willet
the
elder
undergo
the
great
emotion
of
astonishment
of
which
our
common
nature
be
susceptible
---
to
say
that
he
be
in
a
perfect
paralysis
of
surprise
,
and
that
he
wander
into
the
most
stupendous
and
theretofore
unattainable
height
of
complicated
amazement

would
be
to
shadow
forth
his
state
of
mind
in
the
feeble
and
lame
term

<EOS>
if
a
roc

an
eagle

a
griffin

elephant

a
winged
sea

horse
,
have
suddenly
appear

and
,
take
him
on
its
back
,
carry
him
bodily
into
the
heart
of
the
"
Salwanners

"
it
would
have
be
to
him
as
an
everyday
occurrence

in

unnoticed

a
young
lady
be
talk
to
each
other
in
the
most
impassioned
manner
,
kiss
each
other
,
and
make
themselves
in
all
respect
perfectly
at
home
;
be
a
position
so
tremendous
,
so
inexplicable
,
so
utterly
beyond
the
wide
range
of
his
capacity
of
comprehension
,
that
he
fall
into
a
lethargy
of
wonder
,
and
could
no
more
rouse
himself
than
an

first

an

and
with
this

he
utter
in
a
low
voice
as
though

some
grave
question
with
himself

he
use
the
little
finger
---
if
any
of
his
finger
can
be
say
to
have
come
under

quite
motionless

at

suddenly
,

without

notice
,
burst
(
to
the
great
consternation
of

into

air

mourning

who
in

in

accustomed

enter

parlour

ascend
the
flight

abrupt

steep

quaintly
fashioned
as
of

they
turn
into
the
good

the

Mrs

in

but
I
have
bear
them
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
break
where
I
should
have
bent
;
and
have
muse
and
brood
,
when
my
spirit
should
have
mix
with
all
God
's
great
creation
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
who
learn
endurance
,
be
they
who
call
the
whole

brother

<EOS>
I
have
turn
from
the

I
pay
the
penalty

"
  
<EOS>
Edward
would
have
interpose
,
but
he
go
on
without
give
him
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
late
to
evade
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
,
that
if
I
have
to
live
my
life
once
more
,
I
may
amend
this
fault
---
not
so
much
,
I
discover
when
I
search
my
mind
,
for
the
love
of
what
be
right
,
as
for
my
own
sake
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
when
I
make
these
well
resolution
,
I
instinctively
recoil
from
the
idea
of
suffer
again
what
I
have
undergo
;
and
in
this
circumstance
I
find
the
unwelcome
assurance
that
I
should
still
be
the
same
man
,
though
I
could
cancel
the
past
,
and
begin
anew
,
with
its
experience
to
guide
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

you
make
too
sure
of
that

You
think
so

Mr
Haredale
answer
,

I
be
glad
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
myself
better
,

therefore
distrust
myself
more
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
leave
this
subject
for
another
---
not
so
far
remove
from
it
as
it
may
,
at
first
sight
,
seem
to
be

Sir

I
have
that
assurance
from

It

plain
enough

that
this

that
the

him
the

what
congratulation

<EOS>
there

how

go
wildly
from

tranquillised
,
as
to
stretch
himself
on

<EOS>
before
leave
this
bright

it
may
be
well
to
glance
at
a
dark
and
very
different
one
which
be
present

a

that

night

the

They
stand
about
a

one
of

hold
up
a
dim
lantern

the
only
light
there

which
shed
its
feeble
ray
upon
the
book
of
prayer

He
place
it
for
a
moment
on
the
coffin
,
when
he
and
his
companion
be
about
to

it
down
.

there
be

the

fall
solemnly
upon

leave
a

the

when

<EOS>
to
see
how
she
come
in

arm
-
in

arm
with
Joe
;
and
how
she
make
an
effort
not

seem
at
all
confused
;
and
how
she
make
believe
she
do

coax

yet
so
charmingly
wrong
that

<EOS>
---
why
,
the
locksmith
could
have
look
on
at
this
(
as
he
mention
to
Mrs
Varden
when
they
retire
for
the
night
)
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
at
a
stretch
,
and
never
wish
it
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
recollection
,
too
,
with
which
they
make
merry
over
that
long
protract
tea
!
 
<EOS>
the
glee
with
which
the
locksmith
ask
Joe
if
he
remember
that
stormy
night
at
the
Maypole
when
he
first
ask
after
Dolly
---
the
laugh
they
all
have
,
about
that
night
when
she
be
go
out
to
the
party
in
the
sedan
-
chair
---
the
unmerciful
manner
in
which
they
rally
Mrs
Varden
about
put
those
flower
outside
that
very
window
---
the
difficulty
Mrs
Varden
find
in
join
the
laugh
against
herself
,
at
first
,
and
the
extraordinary
perception
she
have
of
the
joke
when
she
overcome
it
---
the
confidential
statement
of
Joe
concern
the
precise
day
and
hour
when
he
be
first
conscious
of
be
fond
of
Dolly
,
and
Dolly
's
blush
admission
,
half
volunteered
and
half
extort
,
as
to
the
time
from

she
date
the
discovery
that
she
"
do
not
mind
"
Joe
---
here
be
an
exhaustless
fund
of
mirth
and
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
a
great
deal
to
be
say
regard
Mrs
Varden
's
doubt
,
and
motherly
alarm
,
and
shrewd
suspicion
;
and
it
appear
that
from
Mrs
Varden
's
penetration
and
extreme
sagacity
nothing
have
ever
be
hide
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
know
it
all
along
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
see
it
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
always
predict
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
aware
of
it
before
the
principal
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
say
within
herself
(
for
she
remember
the
exact
word
)
"
that
young
Willet
be
certainly
look
after
our
Dolly
,
and
I
must
look
after
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
she
have
look
after
him
,
and
have
observe
many
little
circumstance
(
all
of
which
she
name
)
<EOS>
so
exceedingly
minute
that
nobody
else
could
make
anything
out
of
them
even
now
;
and
have
<EOS>
,
it
seem
from
first
to
last
,
display
the
most
unbounded
tact
and
most
consummate
generalship
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
the
night
when
Joe
WOULD
ride
homeward
by
the
side
of
the
chaise
,
and
when
Mrs
Varden
WOULD
insist
upon
his
go
back
again
,
be
not
forget
---
nor
the
night
when
dolly
faint
on
his
name
be
mention
---
nor
the
time
upon
time
when
Mrs
Varden
,
ever
watchful
and
prudent
,
have
find
her
pining
in
her
own
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
nothing
be
forget
;
and
everything
by
some
mean
or
other
bring
them
back
to
the
conclusion
,
that
that
be
the
happy
hour
in
all
their
life
;
consequently
,
that
everything
must
have
occur
for
the
good
,
and
nothing
could
be
suggest
which
would
have
make
it
well
.
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
in
the
full
glow
of
such
discourse
as
this
,
there
come
a
startling
knock
at
the
door
,
open
from
the
street
into
the
workshop
,
which
have
be
keep
close
all
day
that
the
house
may
be
more
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
,
as
in
duty
bind
,
would
hear
of
nobody
but
himself
go
to
open
it
;
and
accordingly
leave
the
room
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
odd
enough
,
certainly
,
if
Joe
have
forget
the
way
to
this
door
;
and
even
if
he
have
,
as
it
be
a
pretty
large
one
and
stand
straight
before
him
,
he
could
not
easily
have
miss
it
.
<EOS>
but
dolly
,
perhaps
because
she
be
in
the
flutter
of
spirit
before
mention
,
or
perhaps
because
she
think
he
would
not
be
able
to
open
it
with
his
one
arm
---
she
could
have
have
no
other
reason
---
 
<EOS>
hurry
out
after
him
;
and
they
stop
so
long
in
the
passage
---
no
doubt
owe
to
Joe
's
entreaty
that
she
would
not
expose
herself
to
the
draught
of
July
air
which
must
infallibly
come
rush
in
on
this
same
door
be
open
---
that
the
knock
be
repeat
,
in
a
yet
more
startling
manner
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
anybody
go
to
open
that
door
?
"
cry
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
or

I

"
  
<EOS>
upon
that
,
Dolly
go
run
back
into
the
parlour
,
all
dimple
and
blush
;
and
Joe
open
it
with
a
mighty
noise
,
and
other
superfluous
demonstration
of
be
in
a
violent
hurry
.
  
<EOS>
"
well

"
say
the
locksmith
,
when
he
reappear
:
"

Mrs

loss
as

could
only
shake

head
in

the

wheel
his

view
of

stare
at

smote
his

elevate
his

open
his

He

,
before
turn
his
back
upon
it
,
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
the
journey
be
a
very
different
one
,
in
those
day
,
from
what
the
present
generation
find
it
;
but
it
come
to
an
end
,
as
the
long
journey
will
,
and
he
stand
again
in
the
street
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
He
lie
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
stop
,
and
resolve
,
before
he
go
to
bed
,
that
he
would
make
his
arrival
know
to
no
one
;
would
spend
but
another
night
in
London
;
and
would
spare
himself
the
pang
of
parting
,
even
with
the
honest
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
such
condition
of
the
mind
as
that
to
which
he
be
a
prey
when
he
lie
down
to
rest
,
be
favourable
to
the
growth
of
disorder
fancy
,
and
uneasy
vision
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
this
,
even
in
the
horror
with
which
he
start
from
his
first
sleep
,
and
throw
up
the
window
to
dispel
it
by
the
presence
of
some
object
,
beyond
the
room
,
which
have
not
be
,
as
it
be
,
the
witness
of
his
dream
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
a
new
terror
of
the
night
;
it
have
be
present
to
him
before
,
in
many
shape
;
it
have
haunt
him
in
bygone
time
,
and
visit
his
pillow
again
and
again
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
but
an
ugly
object
,
a
childish
spectre
,
haunt
his
sleep
,
its
return
,
in
its
old
form
,
may
have
awaken
a
momentary
sensation
of
fear
,
which
,
almost
in
the
act
of
wake
,
would
have
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
this
disquiet
,
however
,
linger
about
him
,
and
would
yield
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
close
his
eye
again
,
he
feel
it
hover
near
;
as
he
slowly
sink
into
a
slumber
,
he
be
conscious
of
its
gathering
strength
and
purpose
,
and
gradually
assume
its
recent
shape
;
when
he
spring
up
from
his
bed
,
the
same
phantom
vanish
from
his
heated
brain
,
and
leave
him
fill
with
a
dread
against
which
reason
and
wake
thought
be
powerless
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
be
up
,
before
he
could
shake
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
late
,
but
not
refresh
,
and
remain
within
door
all
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
fancy
for
pay
his
last
visit
to
the
old
spot
in
the
evening
,
for
he
have
be
accustom
to
walk
there
at
that
season
,
and
desire
to
see
it
under
the
aspect
that
be
most
familiar
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
an
hour
as
would
afford
him
time
to
reach
it
a
little
before
sunset
,
he
leave
the
inn
,
and
turn
into
the
busy
street
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
go
far
,
and
be
thoughtfully
make
his
way
among
the
noisy
crowd
,
when
he
feel
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
,
turn
,
recognise
one
of
the
waiter
from
the
inn
,
who
beg
his
pardon
,
but
he
have
leave
his
sword
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
have
you
bring
it
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
stretch
out
his
hand
,
and
yet
not
take
it
from
the
man
,
but
look
at
him
in
a
disturbed
and
agitated
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
be
sorry
to
have
disoblige
him
,
and
would
carry
it
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
say
that
he
be
go
a
little
way
into
the
country
,
and
that
he
may
not
return
until
late
.
 
<EOS>
the
road
be
not
very
safe
for
single
traveller
after
dark
;
and
,
since
the
riot
,
gentleman
have
be
more
careful
than
ever
,
not
to
trust
themselves
unarmed
in
lonely
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
think
you
be
a
stranger
,
sir
,
"
he
add
,
"
and
that
you
may
believe
our
road
to
be
well
than
they
be
;
but
perhaps
you
know
them
well
,
and
carry
fire
-

"
  
He
take
the
sword
,
and
put
it
up
at
his
side
,
thank
the
man
,
and
resume
his
walk
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
long
remember
that
he
do
this
in
a
manner
so
strange
,
and
with
such
a
tremble
hand
,
that
the
messenger
stand
look
after
his
retreat
figure
,
doubtful
whether
he
ought
not
to
follow
,
and
watch
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
long
remember
that
he
have
be
hear
pace
his
bedroom
in
the
dead
of
the
night
;
that
the
attendant
have
mention
to
each
other
in
the
morning
,
how
fevere
and
how
pale
he
look
;
and
that
when
this
man
go
back
to
the
inn
,
he
tell
a
fellow
-
servant
that
what
he
have
observe
in
this
short
interview
lie
very
heavy
on
his
mind
,
and
that
he
fear
the
gentleman
intend
to
destroy
himself
,
and
would
never
come
back
alive
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
half
-
consciousness
that
his
manner
have
attract
the
man
's
attention
(
remember
the
expression
of
his
face
when
they
part
)
,
Mr
Haredale
quicken
his
step
;
and
arrive
at
a
stand
of
coach
,
bargain
with
the
driver
of
the
good
to
carry
him
so
far
on
his
road
as
the
point
where
the
footway
strike
across
the
field
,
and
to
await
his
return
at
a
house
of
entertainment
which
be
within
a
stone's
-
throw
of
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
there
in
due
course
,
he
alight
and
pursue
his
way
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
He
pass
so
near
the
Maypole
,
that
he
could
see
its
smoke
rise
from
among
the
tree
,
while
a
flock
of
pigeon
---
some
of
its
old
inhabitant
,
doubtless
---
sail
gaily
home
to
roost
,
between
him
and
the
unclouded
sky
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
old
house
will
brighten
up
now
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
look
towards
it
,
"
and
there
will
be
a
merry
fireside
beneath
its
ivied
roof
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
comfort
to
know
that
everything
will
not
be
blight
hereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
one
picture
of
life
and
cheerfulness
to
turn
to
,
in
my
mind
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
resume
his
walk
,
and
bend
his
step
towards
the
Warren
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
clear
,
calm
,
silent
evening
,
with
hardly
a
breath
of
wind
to
stir
the
leave
,
or
any
sound
to
break
the
stillness
of
the
time
,
but
drowsy
sheep
-
bell
tinkle
in
the
distance
,
and
,
at
interval
,
the
far
-
off
lowing
of
cattle
,
or
bark
of
village
dog
.
 
<EOS>
the
sky
be
radiant
with
the
soften
glory
of
sunset
;
and
on
the
earth
,
and
in
the
air
,
a
deep
repose
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
an
hour
,
he
arrive
at
the
deserted
mansion
which
have
be
his
home
so
long
,
and
look
for
the
last
time
upon
its
blacken
wall
.
  
<EOS>
the
ashe
of
the
common
fire
be
melancholy
thing
,
for
in
them
there
be
an
image
of
death
and
ruin
,
---
of
something
that
have
be
bright
,
and
be
but
dull
,
cold
,
dreary
dust
,
---
with
which
our
nature
force
us
to
sympathise
.
 
<EOS>
how
much
more
sad
the
crumbled
ember
of
a
home
:
<EOS>
the
cast
down
of
that
great
altar
,
where
the
bad
among
us
sometimes
perform
the
worship
of
the
heart
;
and
where
the
good
have
offer
up
such
sacrifice
,
and
do
such
deed
of
heroism
,
as
,
chronicle
,
would
put
the
proud
temple
of
old
Time
,
with
all
their
vaunt
annal
,
to
the
blush
!
  
<EOS>
He
rouse
himself
from
a
long
train
of
meditation
,
and
walk
slowly
round
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
by
this
time
almost
dark
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
nearly
make
the
circuit
of
the
building
,
when
he
utter
a
half
-
suppress
exclamation
,
start
,
and
stand
still
.
 
<EOS>
reclining
,
in
an
easy
attitude
,
with
his
back
against
a
tree
,
and
contemplate
the
ruin
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
,
---
a
pleasure
<EOS>
so
keen
that
it
overcome
his
habitual
indolence
and
command
of
feature
,
and
display
itself
utterly
free
from
all
restraint
or
reserve
,
---
before
him
,
on
his
own
ground
,
and
triumph
then
,
as
he
have
triumph
in
every
misfortune
and
disappointment
of
his
life
,
stand
the
man
whose
presence
,
of
all
mankind
,
in
any
place
,
and
least
of
all
in
that
,
he
could
the
least
endure
.
  
<EOS>
although
his
blood
so
rise
against
this
man
,
and
his
wrath
so
stir
within
him
,
that
he
could
have
strike
him
dead
,
he
put
such
fierce
constraint
upon
himself
that
he
pass
him
without
a
word
or
look
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
and
he
would
have
go
on
,
and
not
turn
,
though
to
resist
the
Devil
who
pour
such
hot
temptation
in
his
brain
,
require
an
effort
scarcely
to
be
achieve
,
if
this
man
have
not
himself
summon
him
to
stop
:
and
that
,
with
an
assumed
compassion
in
his
voice
which
drive
him
well
-
nigh
mad
,
and
in
an
instant
route
all
the
self
-
command
it
have
be
anguish
---
acute
,
poignant
anguish

to
sustain
.
  
<EOS>
all
consideration
,
reflection
,
mercy
,
forbearance
;
everything
by
which
a
goad
man
can
curb
his
rage
and
passion
;
flee
from
him
as
he
turn
back
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
say
,
slowly
and
quite
calmly
---
far
more
calmly
than
he
have
ever
speak
to
him
before
:
  
<EOS>
"
why
have
you
call
to
me
?
"

to
remark
,
"
say
Sir

with
his
wonted
composure
,
"
what
an
odd
chance
it
be
,
that
we
should
meet
here

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
strange
chance

"
<EOS>
strange
?
 
<EOS>
the
most
remarkable
and
singular
thing
in
the
world

I
never

in
the
evening

I

not

so
for
year

me
,
quite
unaccountably
,
in
the
middle
of
last
night

very
picturesque

He
point

as
he

dismantled

raise
his

to
his
eye

Sir

let
fall
his
glass
;
incline
his

an
air

its
shelter

refuge

reopen

It

<EOS>
It

indeed
it

It

before

<EOS>
as

silver
snuff

box
which
the
King
send
Joe
with
his

because

Maypole
without
put
finger

into
that
box

take
a
great
pinch

never
take

into
convulsion
even
then

where
be
the
man
who
live
in

never

at
the
Maypole

to
all
appearance
as
much
at
home
in
the
good
room

as

he
live
there

what
fact

<EOS>
Mr
Willet
the
elder
,
have
be
by
some
extraordinary
mean
possess
with
the
idea
that
Joe
want
to
be
married
,
and
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
,
his
father
,
to
retire
into
private
life
,
and
enable
him
to
live
in
comfort
,
take
up
his
abode
in
a
small
cottage
at
Chigwell
;
where
they
widen
and
enlarge
the
fireplace
for
him
,
hang
up
the
boiler
,
and
furthermore
plant
in
the
little
garden
outside
the
front
-
door
,
a
fictitious
maypole
;
so
that
he
be
quite
at
home
directly

<EOS>
to
this
,
his
new
habitation
,
Tom
Cobb
,
Phil
Parkes

Solomon

and
in
the
chimney

corner

they
all
four
quaff
,
and
smoke
,
and
prose
,
and
doze
,
as
they
have
do
of
old

<EOS>
It
be
accidentally
discover
after
a
short
time
that
Mr
Willet
still
appear
to
consider
himself
a
landlord
by
profession
,
Joe
provide
him
with
a
slate
,
upon
which
the
old
man
regularly
score
up
vast
account
for
meat
,
drink
,
and
tobacco
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
grow
old
this
passion
increase
upon
him
;
and
it
become
his
delight
to
chalk
against
the
name
of
each
of
his
crony
a
sum
of
enormous
magnitude
,
and
impossible
to
be
pay
:
and
such
be
his
secret
joy
in
these
entry
,
that
he
would
be
perpetually
see
go
behind
the
door
to
look
at
them
,
and
come
forth
again
,
suffuse
with
the
lively
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
He
never
recover
the
surprise
the
Rioters
have
give
him
,
and
remain
in
the
same
mental
condition
down
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
to
have
be
bring
to
a
speedy
termination
by
the
first
sight
of
his
first
grandchild
,
which
appear
to
fill
him
with
the
belief
that
some
alarm
miracle
have
happen
to
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
be
promptly
blooded
,
however
,
by
a
skilful
surgeon

he
rally
;
and
although
the
doctor
all
agree
,
on
his
be
attack
with
symptom
of
apoplexy
six
month
afterwards
,
that
he
ought
to
die
,
and
take
it
very
ill
that
he
do
not
<EOS>
,
he
remain
alive
---
possibly
on
account
of
his
constitutional
slowness
---
 
for
nearly
seven
year
more
,
when
he
be
one
morning
find
speechless
in
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
lie
in
this
state
,
free
from
all
token
of
uneasiness
,
for
a
whole
week
,
when
he
be
suddenly
restore
to
consciousness
by
hear
the
nurse
whisper
in
his
son
's
ear
that
he
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
a

going
,
Joseph
,
"
say
Mr
Willet
,
turn
round
upon
the
instant
,
"
to
the
Salwanners
"
---
and
immediately
give
up
the
ghost
.
  
<EOS>
He
leave
a
large
sum
of
money
behind
him
;
even
more
than
he
be
suppose
to
have
be
worth
,
although
the
neighbour
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
mankind
in
calculate
the
wealth
that
other
people
ought
to
have
save
,
have
estimate
his
property
in
good
round
number
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
inherit
the
whole
;
so
that
he
become
a
man
of
great
consequence
in
those
part
,
and
be
perfectly
independent
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
elapse
before
Barnaby
get
the
well
of
the
shock
he
have
sustain
,
or
regain
his
old
health
and
gaiety
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
recover
by
degree
:
<EOS>
and
although
he
could
never
separate
his
condemnation
and
escape
from
the
idea
of
a
terrific
dream
,
he
become
,
in
other
respect
,
more
rational
.
 
<EOS>
date
from
the
time
of
his
recovery
,
he
have
a
well
memory
and
great
steadiness
of
purpose
;
but
a
dark
cloud
overhang
his
whole
previous
existence
,
and
never
clear
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
the
less
happy
for
this
,
for
his
love
of
freedom
and
interest
in
all
that
move
or
grow
,
or
have
its
being
in
the
element
,
remain
to
him
unimpaired
.
 
<EOS>
He
live
with
his
mother
on
the
Maypole
farm
,
tend
the
poultry
and
the
cattle
,
work
in
a
garden
of
his
own
,
and
help
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
know
to
every
bird
and
beast
about
the
place
,
and
have
a
name
for
every
one
.
<EOS>
never
be
there
a
light
-
hearted
husbandman
,
a
creature
more
popular
with
young
and
old
,
a
blither
or
more
happy
soul
than
Barnaby
;
and
though
he
be
free
to
ramble
where
he
would
,
he
never
quit
Her
,
but
be
for
evermore
her
stay
and
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
that
although
he
have
that
dim
sense
of
the
past
,
he
seek
out
Hugh
's
dog
,
and
take
him
under
his
care
;
and
that
he
never
could
be
tempt
into
London
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
riot
be
many
year
old
,
and
Edward
and
his
wife
come
back
to
England
with
a
family
almost
as
numerous
as
Dolly
's
,
and
one
day
appear
at
the
Maypole
porch
,
he
know
them
instantly
,
and
weep
and
leap
for
joy
.
 
<EOS>
but
neither
to
visit
them
,
nor
on
any
other
pretence
,
no
matter
how
full
of
promise
and
enjoyment
,
could
he
be
persuade
to
set
foot
in
the
street
:
nor
do
he
ever
conquer
this
repugnance
or
look
upon
the
town
again
.
  
<EOS>
Grip
soon
recover
his
look
,
and
become
as
glossy
and
sleek
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
profoundly
silent
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
have
forget
the
art
of
Polite
Conversation
in
Newgate
,
or
have
make
a
vow
in
those
troubled
time
to
forego
,
for
a
period
,
the
display
of
his
accomplishment
,
be
matter
of
uncertainty
;
but
certain
it
be
that
for
a
whole
year
he
never
indulge
in
any
other
sound
than
a
grave
,
decorous
croak
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
expiration
of
that
term
,
the
morning
be
very
bright
and
sunny
,
he
be
hear
to
address
himself
to
the
horse
in
the
stable
,
upon
the
subject
of
the
Kettle
,
so
often
mention
in
these
page
;
and
before
the
witness
who
overhear
him
could
run
into
the
house
with
the
intelligence
,
and
add
to
it
upon
his
solemn
affirmation
the
statement
that
he
have
hear
him
laugh
,
the
bird
himself
advance
with
fantastic
step
to
the
very
door
of
the
bar
,
and
there
cry
,
"
I
be
a
devil
,
I
be
a
devil
,
I
be
a
devil
!
"
<EOS>
with
extraordinary
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
from
that
period
(
although
he
be
suppose
to
be
much
affect
by
the
death
of
Mr
Willet
senior
)
,
he
constantly
practise
and
improve
himself
in
the
vulgar
tongue
;
and
,
as
he
be
a
mere
infant
for
a
raven
when
Barnaby
be
grey
,
he
have
very
probably
go
on
talk
to
the
present
time
.
