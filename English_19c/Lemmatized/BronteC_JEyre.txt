there
be
no

of
take
a
walk
that

<EOS>
We
have
be
wander
,
indeed
,
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
;
but
since
dinner
(
Mrs.
Reed
,
when
there
be
no

,
dine
early
)
<EOS>
the

winter
wind
have
bring
with

so
sombre

<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
:
I
never
like
long
walk
,
especially
on
chilly
afternoon
:
<EOS>
dreadful
to
me
be
the
come
home
in
the
raw
twilight
,
with
nipped
finger
and
toe
,
and
a
heart
sadden
by
the
chiding
of
Bessie
,
the
nurse
,
and
humble
by
the
consciousness
of
my
physical
inferiority
to
Eliza
,
John

Eliza

<EOS>
round
their

in

:
she
lie
recline
on
a
sofa
by
the
fireside
,
and
with
her
darling
about
her
(
for
the

neither
quarrel

look
perfectly
happy

<EOS>
Me
,
she
have

the

say
,
"
She
regret
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
keep
me
at
a
distance
;
but
that
until
she
hear
from
Bessie
,
and
could
discover
by
her
own
observation

that
I
be
endeavour
in
good

to
acquire
a

childlike
disposition

a

sprightly

something
light

franker

what
do

do
?

I
ask

<EOS>
"
Jane

I
do
not

there

up

a

adjoin
the

room

I
slip
in
there
.
<EOS>
It
contain
a

:
I
soon
possess
myself
of
a
volume
,
take
care
that
it
should
be
one
store
with
picture
.
<EOS>
I
mount
into
the
window-
seat
:
gather
up
my
foot
<EOS>
,
I
sit
cross
-
legged
,
like
a
Turk

and
,
have
draw
the
red

nearly
close

protect
,
but
not
separate
me
from
the
drear
November
day
.
<EOS>
at
interval
,
while
turn
over
the
leave
of
my
book
,
I
study
the
aspect
of
that
winter
afternoon
.
<EOS>
afar
,
it
offer
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
;
near
a
scene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
-
beat
shrub
,
with
ceaseless
rain
sweep
away
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
book
 
Bewick
's
history
of
british
Birds
:
the
letterpress
thereof
I
care
little
for
,
generally
speak
;
and
yet
there
be
certain
introductory
page
that
,
child
as
I
be
,
I
could
not
pass
quite
as
a
blank
.
<EOS>
They
be
those
which
treat
of
the
haunt
of
sea
-
fowl
;
of
"
the
solitary
rock
and
promontory
"
by
them
only
inhabit
;
of
the
coast
of
Norway
,
stud
with
isle
from
its
southern
extremity
,
the
Lindeness
,
or
Naze
,
to
the
North
Cape
    
"
where
the
Northern
Ocean
,
in
vast
whirl
,
boil
round
the
naked
,
melancholy
isle
of
farth
Thule
;
and
the
Atlantic
surge
pour
in
among
the
stormy
hebride
.
"
  
<EOS>
nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shore
of
Lapland
,
Siberia
,
Spitzbergen
,
Nova
Zembla
,
Iceland
,
Greenland
,
with
"
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
,
and
those
forlorn
region
of
dreary
space
,
 
that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
,
where
firm
field
of
ice
,
the
accumulation
of
century
of
winter
,
glaze
in
Alpine
height
above
height
,
surround
the
pole
,
and
concentre
the
multiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
.
<EOS>
"
of
these
death
-
white
realm
I
form
an
idea
of
my
own
:
shadowy
,
like
all
the
half
-
comprehend
notion
that
float
dim
through
child
's
brain
,
but
strangely
impressive
.
<EOS>
the
word
in
these
introductory
page
connect
themselves
with
the
succeed
vignette
,
and
give
significance
to
the
rock
stand
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
;
to
the
broken
boat
strand
on
a
desolate
coast
;
to
the
cold
and
ghastly
moon
glance
through
bar
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sink
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
what
sentiment
haunt
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
,
with
its
inscribed
headstone
;
its
gate
,
its
two
tree
,
its
low
horizon
,
girdle
by
a
broken
wall
,
and
its
newly
-
rise
crescent
,
attest
the
hour
of
eventide
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
ship
becalm
on
a
torpid
sea

I
believe
to
be
marine
phantom
.
  
<EOS>
the
fiend
pin
down
the
thief
's
pack
behind
him
<EOS>
,
I
pass
over
quickly
:
it
be
an
object
of
terror
.
  
<EOS>
so
be
the
black
horn
thing
seat
aloof
on
a
rock
,
survey
a
distant
crowd
surround
a
gallow
.
  
<EOS>
each
picture
tell
a
story
;
mysterious
often
to
my
undeveloped
understanding
and
imperfect
feeling
,
yet
ever
profoundly
interesting
:
as
interesting
as
the
tale
<EOS>
Bessie
sometimes
narrate
on
winter
evening
,
when
she
chance
to
be
in
good
humour
;
and
when
,
have
bring
her
ironing

table
to
the
nursery
hearth
,
she
allow
us
to
sit
about
it
,
and
while
she
get
up
Mrs.

's
lace
frill
,
and
crimp
her
nightcap
border
,
feed
our
eager
attention
with
passage
of
love
and
adventure
take
from
old
fairy
tale
and
other
ballad
;
or
(
as
at
a

period
I
discover

from

Henry

Earl
of
Moreland

<EOS>
with
Bewick
on

happy
at

in

I
fear
nothing

interruption

come

soon

<EOS>
"

cry
the

John

I
come
out

forth
by

Jack

the
answer

<EOS>
"
I
want

and
seat
himself
in
an

chair
,
he
intimate
by
a
gesture
that
I
be
to
approach
and
stand
before
him

<EOS>
John
Reed
be
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
year
old
;
four
year
old
than
I
,
for
I
be
but
ten
:
large
and
stout
for
his
age
,
with
a
dingy
and
unwholesome
skin
;
thick
lineament
in
a
spacious
visage
,
heavy
limb
and
large
extremity
.
<EOS>
He
gorge
himself
habitually
at
table
,
which
make
him
bilious
,
and
give
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eye
and
flabby
cheek
.
<EOS>
He
ought
now
to
have
be
at
school
;
but
his
mama
have
take
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
,
"
on
account
of
his
delicate
health
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Miles
,
the
master
,
affirm
that
he
would
do
very
well
if
he
have
few
cake
and
sweetmeat
send
him
from
home
;
but
the
mother
's
heart
turn
from
an
opinion
so
harsh
,
and
incline
rather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
's
sallowness
be
owe
to
over
-
application
and
,
perhaps
,
to
pine
after
home
.
  
<EOS>
John
have
not
much
affection
for
his
mother
and
sister
,
and
an
antipathy
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
bully
and
punish
me
;
not
two
or
three
time
in
the
week
,
nor
once
or
twice
in
the
day
,
but
continually
:
every
nerve
I
have
fear
him
,
and
every
morsel
of
flesh
in
my
bone
shrink
when
he
come
near
.
<EOS>
there
be
moment
when
I
be
bewilder
by
the
terror
he
inspire
,
because
I
have
no
appeal
<EOS>
whatever
against
either
his
menace
or
his
infliction
;
the
servant
do
not
like
to
offend
their
young
master
by
take
my
part
against
him
,
and
Mrs.
Reed
be
blind
and
deaf
on
the
subject
:
she
never
see
him
strike
or
hear
him
abuse
me
,
though
he
do
both
now
and
then
in
her
very
presence
,
more
frequently
,
however
,
behind
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
habitually
obedient
to
John
,
I
come
up
to
his
chair
:
he
spend
some
three
minute
in
thrust
out
his
tongue
at
me
as
far
as
he
could
without
damage
the
root
:
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
soon
strike
,
and
while
dread
the
blow
,
I
muse
on
the
disgusting
and
ugly
appearance
of
him
who
would
presently
deal
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
he
read
that
notion
in
my
face
;
for
,
all
at
once
,
without
speak
,
he
strike
suddenly
and
strongly
.
<EOS>
I
totter
,
and
on
regain
my
equilibrium
retire
back
a
step
or
two
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
for
your
impudence

your
eye
two
minute
since

you

"
  
<EOS>
accustomed
to
John
Reed
's
abuse
,
I
never
have
an
idea
of
reply
to
it
;
my
care
be
how
to
endure
the
blow
which
would
certainly
follow
the
insult
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
do
behind
the
curtain
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
show
the
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
window
and
fetch
it
thence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
business
to

eat
the

meal
we

and
wear

at

now

my

do
so

not
at

aware

be
his
intention

when
I
see
him
lift
and
poise
the

stand
in
act
to
hurl
it

I
instinctively
start
aside
with
a
cry
of
alarm

not
soon
enough

the
volume
be
flung
,
it
hit
me
,

I
fall
,
strike
my
head
against
the
door

cut
it

the
cut
bleed

the
pain
be
sharp

my
terror
have
pass
its
climax

other
feeling
succeed

run
headlong
at

grasp
my
hair

have
close
with
a
desperate

really
see
in

down

this
preparation

<EOS>
Mr.

dead
nine

here

dreary
consecration

My
seat

<EOS>
all
look
cold

<EOS>
I
be
a
discord
in
Gateshead
Hall
<EOS>
:
I
be
like
nobody
there
;
I
have
nothing
in
harmony
with
Mrs.
Reed
or
her
child
,
or
her
choose
vassalage
.
<EOS>
if
they
do
not
love
me
,
in
fact
,
as
little
do
I
love
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
bind
to
regard
with
affection
a
thing
that
could
not
sympathise
with
one
amongst
them
;
a
heterogeneous
thing
,
oppose
to
them
in
temperament
,
in
capacity
,
in
propensity
;
a
useless
thing
,
incapable
of
serve
their

or
add

;
a
noxious

cherish
the

<EOS>
Mrs.

would
have
endure
my
presence
more
complacently
;
her
child
would
have
entertain
for
me
more
of
the
cordiality
of
fellow

feeling

the

would
have
be

scapegoat

<EOS>
daylight
begin
to
forsake
the
red

room
;
it
be
past
four
o'clock
,
and
the
beclouded
afternoon
be
tend
to
drear
twilight
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
rain
still
beat
continuously
on
the
staircase
window
,
and
the
wind
howl
in
the
grove
behind
the
hall
;
I
grow
by
degree
cold
as
a
stone
,
and
then
my
courage
sink
.
<EOS>
My
habitual
mood
of
humiliation
,
self
-
doubt
,
forlorn
depression
,
fall
damp
on
the
ember
of
my
decaying
ire
.
<EOS>
all
say
I
be
wicked
,
and
perhaps
I
may
be
so
;
what
think
have
I
be
but
just
conceive
of
starve
myself
to
death
?
<EOS>
that
certainly
be
a
crime
:
and
be
I
fit
to
die
?
<EOS>
or
be
the
vault
under
the
chancel
of
Gateshead
Church
an
invite
bourne
?
<EOS>
in
such
vault
I
have
be
tell
do
Mr.
Reed
lie
bury
;
and
lead
by
this
thought
to
recall
his
idea
,
I
dwelt
on
it
with
gather
dread
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
remember
him
;
but
I
know
that
he
be
my
own
uncle
 
<EOS>
my
mother
's
brother
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
take
me
when
a
parentless
infant
to
his
house
;
and
that
in
his
last
moment
he
have
require
a
promise
of
Mrs.
Reed
that
she
would
rear
and
maintain
me
as
one
of
her
own
child
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
probably
consider
she
have
keep
this
promise
;
and
so
she
have
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
as
well
as
her
nature
would
permit
her
;
but
how
could
she
really
like
an
interloper
not
of
her
race
,
and
unconnecte
with
her
,
after
her
husband
's
death
,
by
any
tie
?
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
most
irksome
to
find
herself
bind
by
a
hard
-
wrung
pledge
to
stand
in
the
stead
of
a
parent
to
a
strange
child
she
could
not
love
,
and
to
see
an
uncongenial
alien
permanently
intrude
on
her
own
family
group
.
  
<EOS>
a
singular
notion
dawn
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
 
never
doubt
 
that
if
Mr.
Reed
have
be
alive
he
would
have
treat
me
kindly
;
and
now
,
as
I
sit
look
at
the
white
bed
and
overshadowed
wall
 
occasionally
also
turn
a
fascinated
eye
towards
the
dimly
glean
mirror
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
recall
what
I
have
hear
of
dead
man
,
trouble
in
their
grave
by
the
violation
of
their
last
wish
,
revisit
the
earth
to
punish
the
perjure
and
avenge
the
oppress
;
and
I
think
Mr.
Reed
's
spirit
,
harass
by
the
wrong
of
his
sister
's
child
,
may
quit
its
abode
 
whether
in
the
church
vault
or
in
the
unknown
world
of
the
depart
 
and
rise
before
me
in
this
chamber
.
<EOS>
I
wipe
my
tear
and
hush
my
sobs
,
fearful
lest
any
sign
of
violent
grief
may
waken
a
preternatural
voice
to
comfort
me
,
or
elicit
from
the
gloom
<EOS>
some
haloed
face
,
bend
over
me
with
strange
pity
.
<EOS>
this
idea
,
consolatory
in
theory
,
I
feel
would
be
terrible
if
realise
:
with
all
my
may
I
endeavour
to
stifle
it
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
be
firm
.
<EOS>
shake
my
hair
from
my
eye
,
I
lift
my
head
and
try
to
look
boldly
round
the
dark
room
;
at
this
moment
a
light
gleam
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
be
it
,
I
ask
myself
,
a
ray
from
the
moon
penetrate
some
aperture
in
the
blind
?
<EOS>
no
;
moonlight
be
still
,
and
this
stirred
;
while
I
gaze
,
it
glide
up
to
the
ceiling
and
quiver
over
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
conjecture
readily
that
this
streak
of
light
be
,
in
all
likelihood
,
a
gleam
from
a
lantern
carry
by
some
one
across
the
lawn
:
but
then
,
prepare
as
my
mind
be
for
horror
,
shake
as
my
nerve
be
by
agitation
,
I
think
the
swift
dart
beam
be
a
herald
of
some
coming
vision
from
another
world
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
thick
,
my
head
grow
hot
;
a
sound
fill
my
ear
,
which
I
deem
the
rushing
of
wing
;
something
seem
near
me
;
I
be
oppress
,
suffocate
:
<EOS>
endurance
break
down
;
I
rush
to
the
door
and
shake
the
lock
in
desperate
effort
.
<EOS>
step
come
run
along
the
outer
passage
;
the
key
turn
,
Bessie
and
Abbot
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Eyre
,
be
you
ill
?
"
say
Bessie
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
dreadful
noise
!
<EOS>
it
go
quite
through
me
!
"
exclaim
Abbot
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
me
out
!
<EOS>
let
me
go
into
the
nursery
!
"
be
my
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
for
?
<EOS>
be
you
hurt
?
<EOS>
have
you
see
something
?
"
<EOS>
again
demand
Bessie
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
see
a
light
,
and
I
think
a
ghost
would
come
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
get
hold
of
Bessie
's
hand
,
and
she
do
not
snatch
it
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
scream
out
on
purpose
,
"
declare
Abbot
,
in
some
disgust
.
"
<EOS>
and
what
a
scream
!
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
in
great
pain
one
would
have
excuse
it
,
but
she
only
want
to
bring
us
all
here
:
I
know
her
naughty
trick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
all
this
?
"
demand
another
voice
peremptorily
;
and
Mrs.
Reed
come
along
the
corridor
,
her
cap
fly
wide
,
her
gown
rustle
stormily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Abbot
and
Bessie
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
give
order
that
Jane
Eyre
should
be
leave
in
the
red
-
room
till
I
come
to
her
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Jane
scream
so
loud
,
madam
,
"
plead
Bessie
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
her
go
,
"
be
the
only
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Loose
Bessie
's
hand
,
child
:
<EOS>
you
can
not
succeed
in
get
out
by
these
mean
,
be
assure
.
<EOS>
I
abhor
artifice
,
particularly
in
child
;
it
be
my
duty
to
show
you
that
trick
will
not
answer
:
<EOS>
you
will
now
stay
here
an
hour
longer
,
and
it
be
only
on
condition
of
perfect
submission
and
stillness
that
I
shall
liberate
you
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
o
aunt
!
have
pity
!
<EOS>
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
it
 
<EOS>
let
me
be
punish
some
other
way
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
kill
if
 
"
  
"
silence
!
<EOS>
this
violence
be
all
most
repulsive
:
"
and
so
,
no
doubt
,
she
feel
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
precocious
actress
in
her
eye
;
she
sincerely
look
on
me
as
a
compound
of
virulent
passion
,
mean
spirit
,
and
dangerous
duplicity
.
  
<EOS>
Bessie
and
Abbot
have
retreat
,
Mrs.
Reed
,
impatient
of
my
now
frantic
anguish
and
wild
sobs
,
abruptly
thrust
me
back
and
lock
me
in
,
without
farth
parley
.
<EOS>
I
hear
her
sweep
away
;
and
soon
after
she
be
go
,
I
suppose
I
have
a
species
of
fit
:
unconsciousness
close
the
scene
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
thing
I
remember
be
,
wake
up
with
a
feeling
as
if
I
have
have
a
frightful
nightmare
,
and
see
before
me
a
terrible
red
glare
,
cross
with
thick
black
bar
.
<EOS>
I
hear
voice
,
too
,
speak
with
a
hollow
sound
,
and
as
if
muffle
by
a
rush
of
wind
or
water
:
agitation
,
uncertainty
,
and
an
all
-
predominate
sense
of
terror
confuse
my
faculty
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
become
aware
that
some
one
be
handle
me
;
lift
me
up
and
support
me
in
a
sit
posture
,
and
that
more
tenderly
than
I
have
ever
be
raise
or
uphold
before
.
<EOS>
I
rest
my
head
against
a
pillow
or
an
arm
,
and
feel
easy
.
  
<EOS>
in
five
minute
more
the
cloud
of
bewilderment
dissolve
:
I
know
quite
well
that
I
be
in
my
own
bed
,
and
that
the
red
glare
be
the
nursery
fire
.
<EOS>
It
be
night
:
a
candle
burn
on
the
table
;
Bessie
stand
at
the
bed-
foot
with
a
basin
in
her
hand
,
and
a
gentleman
sit
in
a
chair
near
my
pillow
,
lean
over
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
an
inexpressible
relief
,
a
soothing
conviction
of
protection
and
security
,
when
I
know
that
there
be
a
stranger
in
the
room
,
an
individual
not
belong
to
Gateshead
,
and
not
relate
to
Mrs.
Reed
.
<EOS>
turn
from
Bessie
(
though
her
presence
be
far
less
obnoxious
to
me
than
that
of
Abbot
,
for
instance
,
would
have
be
)
,
I
scrutinise
the
face
of
the
gentleman
:
<EOS>
I
know
him
;
it
be
Mr.
Lloyd
,
an
apothecary
,
sometimes
call
in
by
Mrs.
Reed
when
the
servant
be
ail
:
for
herself
and
the
child
she
employ
a
physician
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
who
be
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
I
pronounce
his
name
,
offer
him
at
the
same
time
my
hand
<EOS>
:
he
take
it
,
smile
and
say
,
"
We
shall
do
very
well
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
lay
me
down
,
and
address
Bessie
,
charge
her
to
be
very
careful
that
I
be
not
disturb
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
have
give
some
further
direction
,
and
intimate
that
he
should
call
again
the
next
day
,
he
depart
;
to
my
grief
:
<EOS>
I
feel
so
sheltered
and
befriend
while
he
sit
in
the
chair
near
my
pillow
;
and
as
he
close
the
door
after
him
,
all
the
room
darken
and
my
heart
again
sink
:
inexpressible
sadness
weigh
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
feel
as
if
you
should
sleep
,
Miss
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Bessie
,
rather
softly
.
  
<EOS>
scarcely
dare
I
answer
her
;
for
I
fear
the
next
sentence
may
be
rough
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
drink
,
or
could
you
eat
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
thank
you
,
Bessie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
think
I
shall
go
to
bed
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
past
twelve
o'clock
;
but
you
may
call
me
if
you
want
anything
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
wonderful
civility
this
!
<EOS>
It
embolden
me
to
ask
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bessie
,
what
be
the
matter
with
me
?
<EOS>
be
I
ill
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
fall
sick
,
I
suppose
,
in
the
red
-
room
with
cry
;
you
will
be
well
soon
,
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
go
into
the
housemaid
's
apartment
,
which
be
near
.
<EOS>
I
hear
her
say
    
<EOS>
"
Sarah
,
come
and
sleep
with
me
in
the
nursery
;
I
dare
not
for
my
life
be
alone
with
that
poor
child
to
-
night
:
<EOS>
she
may
die
;
it
be
such
a
strange
thing
she
should
have
that
fit
:
I
wonder
if
she
see
anything
.
<EOS>
missis
be
rather
too
hard
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sarah
come
back
with
her
;
they
both
go
to
bed
;
they
be
whisper
together
for
half
-
an
-
hour
before
they
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
catch
scrap
of
their
conversation
,
from
which
I
be
able
only
too
distinctly
to
infer
the
main
subject
discuss
.
  
<EOS>
"
something
pass
her
,
all
dress
in
white
,
and
vanish
"
 
"
a
great
black
dog
behind
him
"
 
"
three
loud
rap
on
the
chamber
door
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
light
in
the
churchyard
just
over
his
grave
,
"
etc
.
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
both
sleep
:
the
fire
and
the
candle
go
out
.
<EOS>
for
me
,
the
watch
of
that
long
night
pass
in
ghastly
wakefulness
;
strain
by
dread
:
such
dread
as
child
only
can
feel
.
  
<EOS>
no
severe
or
prolong
bodily
illness
follow
this
incident
of
the
red-
room
;
it
only
give
my
nerve
a
shock
of
which
I
feel
the
reverberation
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
yes
,
Mrs.
Reed
,
to
you
<EOS>
I
owe
some
fearful
pang
of
mental
suffering
,
but
I
ought
to
forgive
you
,
for
you
know
not
what
you
do
:
while
rend
my
heart
-
string
,
you
think
you
be
only
uproot
my
bad
propensity
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
,
by
noon
,
I
be
up
and
dress
,
and
sit
wrap
in
a
shawl
by
the
nursery
hearth
.
<EOS>
I
feel
physically
weak
and
break
down
:
but
my
bad
ailment
be
an
unutterable
wretchedness
of
mind
:
a
wretchedness
which
keep
draw
from
me
silent
tear
;
no
sooner
have
I
wipe
one
salt
drop
from
my
cheek
than
another
follow
.
<EOS>
yet
,
I
think
,
I
ought
to
have
be
happy
,
for
none
of
the
Reeds
be
there
,
they
be
all
go
out
in
the
carriage
with
their
mama
.
<EOS>
Abbot
,
too
,
be
sew
in
another
room
,
and
Bessie
,
as
she
move
hither
and
thither
,
put
away
toy
and
arrange
drawer
,
<EOS>
address
to
me
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
word
of
unwonted
kindness
.
<EOS>
this
state
of
thing
should
have
be
to
me
a
paradise
of
peace
,
accustom
as
I
be
to
a
life
of
ceaseless
reprimand
and
thankless
fagging
;
but
,
in
fact
,
my
rack
nerve
be
now
in
such
a
state
that
no
calm
could
soothe
,
and
no
pleasure
excite
them
agreeably
.
  
<EOS>
Bessie
have
be
down
into
the
kitchen
,
and
she
bring
up
with
her
a
tart
on
a
certain
brightly
paint
china
plate
,
whose
bird
of
paradise
,
nestle
in
a
wreath
of
convolvuli
and
rosebud
,
have
be
will
not
to
stir
in
me
a
most
enthusiastic
sense
of
admiration
;
and
<EOS>
which
plate
I
have
often
petition
to
be
allow
to
take
in
my
hand
in
order
to
examine
it
more
closely
,
but
have
always
hitherto
be
deem
unworthy
of
such
a
privilege
.
<EOS>
this
precious
vessel
be
now
place
on
my
knee
,
and
I
be
cordially
invite
to
eat
the
circlet
of
delicate
pastry
upon
it
.
<EOS>
vain
favour
!
<EOS>
come
,
like
most
other
favour
long
defer
and
often
wish
for
,
too
late
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
eat
the
tart
;
and
the
plumage
of
the
bird
,
the
tint
of
the
flower
,
seem
strangely
fade
:
I
put
both
plate
and
tart
away
.
<EOS>
Bessie
ask
if
I
would
have
a
book
:
<EOS>
the
word
_
book
_
act
as
a
transient
stimulus
,
and
I
beg
her
to
fetch
Gulliver
's
travel
from
the
library
.
<EOS>
this
book
I
have
again
and
again
peruse
with
delight
.
<EOS>
I
consider
it
a
narrative
of
fact
,
and
discover
in
it
a
vein
of
interest
deep
than
what
I
find
in
fairy
tale
:
<EOS>
for
as
to
the
elf
,
have
seek
them
in
vain
among
foxglove
leave
and
bell
,
under
mushroom
and
beneath
the
ground
-
ivy
mantling
old
wall
-
nooks
,
I
have
at
length
make
up
my
mind
to
the
sad
truth
,
that
they
be
all
go
out
of
England
to
some
savage
country
where
the
wood
be
wild
and
thick
,
and
the
population
more
scant
;
whereas
,
Lilliput
and
Brobdignag
be
,
in
my
creed
,
solid
part
of
the
earth
's
surface
,
I
doubt
not
that
I
may
one
day
,
by
take
a
long
voyage
,
see
with
my
own
eye
the
little
field
,
house
,
and
tree
,
the
diminutive
people
,
the
tiny
cow
,
sheep
,
and
bird
of
the
one
realm
;
and
the
corn
-
field
forest
-
high
,
the
mighty
mastiff
,
the
monster
cat
,
the
tower
-
like
man
and
woman
,
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
yet
,
when
this
cherish
volume
be
now
place
in
my
hand
 
when
I
turn
over
its
leave
,
and
seek
in
its
marvellous
picture
the
charm
I
have
,
till
now
,
never
fail
to
find
 
all
be
eerie
and
dreary
;
the
giant
be
gaunt
goblin
,
the
pigmy
malevolent
and
fearful
imp
,
Gulliver
a
most
desolate
wanderer
in
most
dread
and
dangerous
region
.
<EOS>
I
close
the
book
,
which
I
dare
no
longer
peruse
,
and
put
it
on
the
table
,
beside
the
untasted
tart
.
  
<EOS>
Bessie
have
now
finish
dust
and
tidy
the
room
,
and
have
wash
her
hand
,
she
open
a
certain
little
drawer
,
full
of
splendid
shred
of
silk
and
satin
,
and
begin
make
a
new
bonnet
for
Georgiana
's
doll
.
<EOS>
meantime
she
sing
:
<EOS>
her
song
be
    
"
<EOS>
in
the
day
when
we
go
gipsye
,
a
long
time
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
the
song
before
,
and
always
with
lively
delight
;
for
Bessie
have
a
sweet
voice
,
 
at
least
,
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
though
her
voice
be
still
sweet
,
I
find
in
its
melody
an
indescribable
sadness
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
preoccupy
with
her
work
,
she
sing
the

My

Long

soon

the

close
moonless

dreary
over
the
path
of
the
poor
orphan

why
do
they

me
so
far
and
so
lonely

up

there

<EOS>

down

;

Mr.

help
himself
to
a
pinch
of
snuff

as
he
be
return
the
box
to

how
much

how

again

"
<EOS>
but
John
Reed
knock
me
down
,
and
my

shut
me
up
in
the
red

room

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

a

box

<EOS>
"
do

Gateshead
Hall
a

<EOS>
"
It

once
,

low

<EOS>
"
if
you
have
such
,
would
you
like
to
go
to
them

"
  
<EOS>
I
reflect
.
<EOS>
poverty
look
grim
to
grow
people
;
still
more
so
to
child
:
they
have
not
much
idea
of
industrious
,
work
,
respectable
poverty
;
they
think
of
the
word
only
as
connect
with
ragged
clothe
,
scanty
food
,
fireless
grate
,
rude
manner
,
and
debase
vice
:
poverty
for
me
be
synonymous
with
degradation
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
should
not
like
to
belong
to
poor
people
,
"
be
my
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
even
if
they
be
kind
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
:
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
how
poor
people
have
the
mean
of
be
kind
;
and
then
to
learn
to
speak
like
them
,
to
adopt
their
manner
,
to
be
uneducated
,
to
grow
up
like
one
of
the
poor
woman
I
see
sometimes
nurse
their
child
or
wash
their
clothe
at
the
cottage
door
of
the
village
of
Gateshead
:
<EOS>
no
,
I
be
not
heroic
enough
to
purchase
liberty
at
the
price
of
caste
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
your
relative
so
very
poor
?
<EOS>
be
they
work
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
;
Aunt
Reed
say
if
I
have
any
,
they
must
be
a
beggarly
set
:
I
should
not
like
to
go
a
begging
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
like
to
go
to
school
?
"
  
<EOS>
again
I
reflect
:
I
scarcely
know
what
school
be
:
Bessie
sometimes
speak
of
it
as
a
place
where
young
lady
sit
in
the
stock
,
wear
backboard
,
and
be
expect
to
be
exceedingly
genteel
and
precise
:
John
Reed
hate
his
school
,
and
abuse
his
master
;
but
John
Reed
's
taste
be
no
rule
for
mine
,
and
if
Bessie
's
account
of
school
-
discipline
(
gather
from
the
young
lady
of
a
family
where
she
have
live
before
come
to
Gateshead
)
be
somewhat
appalling
,
her
detail
of
certain
accomplishment
attain
by
these
same
young
lady
be
,
I
think
,
equally
attractive
.
<EOS>
She
boast
of
beautiful
painting
of
landscape
and
flower
by
them
execute
;
of
song
they
could
sing
and
piece
they
could
play
,
of
purse
they
could
net
,
of
french
book
they
could
translate
;
till
my
spirit
be
move
to
emulation
as
I
listen
.
<EOS>
besides
,
school
would
be
a
complete
change
:
it
imply
a
long
journey
,
an
entire
separation
from
Gateshead
,
an
entrance
into
a
new
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
indeed
like
to
go
to
school
,
"
be
the
audible
conclusion
of
my
musing
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
<EOS>
who
know
what
may
happen
?
"
say
Mr.
Lloyd
,
as
he
get
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
child
ought
to
have
change
of
air
and
scene
,
"
he
add
,
speak
to
himself
;
"
nerve
not
in
a
good
state
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
now
return
;
at
the
same
moment
the
carriage
be
hear
roll
up
the
gravel
-
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
your
mistress
,
nurse
?
"
ask
Mr.
Lloyd
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
speak
to
her
before
I
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
invite
him
to
walk
into
the
breakfast
-
room
,
and
lead
the
way
out
.
<EOS>
in
the
interview
which
follow
between
him
and
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
presume
,
from
after
-
occurrence
,
that
the
apothecary
venture
to
recommend
my
being
send
to
school
;
and
the
recommendation
be
no
doubt
readily
enough
adopt
;
for
as
Abbot
say
,
in
discuss
the
subject
with
Bessie
when
both
sit
sew
in
the
nursery
one
night
,
after
I
be
in
bed
,
and
,
as
they
think
,
asleep
,
"
missis
be
,
she
dare
say
,
glad
enough
to
get
rid
of
such
a
tiresome
,
ill
-
condition
child
,
who
always
look
as
if
she
be
watch
everybody
,
and
scheme
plot
underhand
.
<EOS>
"
Abbot
,
I
think
,
give
me
credit
for
be
a
sort
of
infantine
Guy
Fawkes
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
same
occasion
I
learn
,
for
the
first
time
,
from
Miss
Abbot
's
communication
to
Bessie
,
that
my
father
have
be
a
poor
clergyman
;
that
my
mother
have
marry
him
against
the
wish
of
her
friend
,
who
consider
the
match
beneath
her
;
that
my
grandfather
Reed
be
so
irritated
at
her
disobedience
,
he
cut
her
off
without
a
shilling
;
that
after
my
mother
and
father
have
be
marry
a
year
,
the
latter
catch
the
typhus
fever
while
visit
among
the
poor
of
a
large
manufacturing
town
where
his
curacy
be
situate
,
and
where
that
disease
be
then
prevalent
:
that
my
mother
take
the
infection
from
him
,
and
both
die
within
a
month
of
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Bessie
,
when
she
hear
this
narrative
,
sigh
and
say
,
"
Poor
Miss
Jane
be
to
be
pity
,
too
,
Abbot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
respond
Abbot
;
"
if
she
be
a
nice
,
pretty
child
,
one
may
compassionate
her
forlornness
;
but
one
really
can
not
care
for
such
a
little
toad
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
great
deal
,
to
be
sure
,
"
agree
Bessie
:
"
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
a
beauty
like
Miss
Georgiana
would
be
more
move
in
the
same
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
doat
on
Miss
Georgiana
!
"
cry
the
fervent
Abbot
.
"
<EOS>
little
darling
!
 
<EOS>
with
her
long
curl
and
her
blue
eye
,
and
such
a
sweet
colour
as
she
have
;
just
as
if
she
be
paint
!
 
<EOS>
Bessie
,
I
could
fancy
a
Welsh
rabbit
for
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
could
I
 
with
a
roast
onion
.
<EOS>
come
,
we
will
go
down
.
<EOS>
"
They
go
.
    
<EOS>
from
my
discourse
with
Mr.
Lloyd
,
and
from
the
above
report
conference
between
Bessie
and
Abbot
,
I
gather
enough
of
hope
to
suffice
as
a
motive
for
wish
to
get
well
:
<EOS>
a
change
seem
near
,
 
I
desire
and
wait
it
in
silence
.
<EOS>
It
tarry
,
however
:
<EOS>
day
and
week
pass
:
I
have
regain
my
normal
state
of
health
,
but
no
new
allusion
be
make
to
the
subject
over
which
I
brood
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
survey
me
at
time
with
a
severe
eye
,
but
seldom
address
me
:
since
my
illness
,
she
have
draw
a
more
marked
line
of
separation
than
ever
between
me
and
her
own
child
;
appoint
me
a
small
closet
to
sleep
in
by
myself
,
condemn
me
to
take
my
meal
alone
,
and
pass
all
my
time
in
the
nursery
,
while
my
cousin
be
constantly
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
not
a
hint
,
however
,
do
she
drop
about
send
me
to
school
:
still
I
feel
an
instinctive
certainty
that
she
would
not
long
endure
me
under
the
same
roof
with
her
;
for
her
glance
,
now
more
than
ever
,
when
turn
on
me
,
express
an
insuperable
and
rooted
aversion
.
  
<EOS>
Eliza
and
Georgiana
,
evidently
act
accord
to
order
,
speak
to
me
as
little
as
possible
:
John
thrust
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
whenever
he
see
me
,
and
once
attempt
chastisement
;
but
as
I
instantly
turn
against
him
,
rouse
by
the
same
sentiment
of
deep
ire
and
desperate
revolt
which
have
stir
my
corruption
before
,
he
think
it
better
to
desist
,
and
run
from
me
titter
execration
,
and
vow
I
have
burst
his
nose
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
level
at
that
prominent
feature
as
hard
a
blow
as
my
knuckle
could
inflict
;
and
when
I
see
that
either
that
or
my
look
daunt
him
,
I
have
the
great
inclination
to
follow
up
my
advantage
to
purpose
;
but
he
be
already
with
his
mama
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
in
a
blubber
tone
commence
the
tale
of
how
"
that
nasty
Jane
Eyre
"
have
fly
at
him
like
a
mad
cat
:
he
be
stop
rather
harshly
    
"
do
not
talk
to
me
about
her
,
John
<EOS>
:
I
tell
you
not
to
go
near
her
;
she
be
not
worthy
of
notice
;
I
do
not
choose
that
either
you
or
your
sister
should
associate
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
,
lean
over
the
banister
,
I
cry
out
suddenly
,
and
without
at
all
deliberate
on
my
word
    
<EOS>
"
They
be
not
fit
to
associate
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
be
rather
a
stout
woman
;
but
,
on
hear
this
strange
and
audacious
declaration
,
she
run
nimbly
up
the
stair
,
sweep
me
like
a
whirlwind
into
the
nursery
,
and
crush
me
down
on
the
edge
of
my
crib
,
dare
me
in
an
emphatic
voice
to
rise
from
that
place
,
or
utter
one
syllable
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
Uncle
Reed
say
to
you
,
if
he
be
alive
?
"
be
my
scarcely
voluntary
demand
.
<EOS>
I
say
scarcely
voluntary
,
for
it
seem
as
if
my
tongue
pronounce
word
without
my
will
consent
to
their
utterance
<EOS>
:
something
speak
out
of
me
over
which
I
have
no
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
say
Mrs.
Reed
under
her
breath
:
<EOS>
her
usually
cold
compose
grey
eye
become
troubled
with
a
look
like
fear
;
she
take
her
hand
from
my
arm
,
and
gaze
at
me
as
if
she
really
do
not
know
whether
I
be
child
or
fiend
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Uncle
Reed
be
in
heaven
,
and
can
see
all
you
do
and
think
;
and
so
can
papa
and
mama
:
<EOS>
they
know
how
you
shut
me
up
all
day
long
,
and
how
you
wish
me
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
soon
rally
her
spirit
:
she
shake
me
most
soundly
,
she
box
both
my
ear
,
and
then
leave
me
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
Bessie
supply
the
hiatus
by
a
homily
of
an
hour
's
length
,
in
which
she
prove
beyond
a
doubt
that
I
be
the
most
wicked
and
abandon
child
ever
rear
under
a
roof
.
<EOS>
I
half
believe
her
;
for
I
feel
indeed
only
bad
feeling
surge
in
my
breast
.
  
<EOS>
November
,
December
,
and
half
of
January
pass
away
.
<EOS>
Christmas
and
the
New
Year
have
be
celebrate
at
Gateshead
with
the
usual
festive
cheer
;
present
have
be
interchange
,
dinner
and
evening
party
give
.
<EOS>
from
every
enjoyment
I
be
,
of
course
,
exclude
:
<EOS>
my
share
of
the
gaiety
consist
in
witness
the
daily
apparelling
of
Eliza
and
Georgiana
,
and
see
them
descend
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
dress
out
in
thin
muslin
frock
and
scarlet
sash
,
with
hair
elaborately
ringlette
;
and
afterwards
,
in
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
piano
or
the
harp
play
below
,
to
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
the
butler
and
footman
,
to
the
jingling
of
glass
and
china
as
refreshment
be
hand
,
to
the
broken
hum
of
conversation
as
the
drawing
-
room
door
open
and
close
.
<EOS>
when
tired
of
this
occupation
,
I
would
retire
from
the
stairhead
to
the
solitary
and
silent
nursery
:
there
,
though
somewhat
sad
,
I
be
not
miserable
.
<EOS>
to
speak
truth
,
I
have
not
the
least
wish
to
go
into
company
,
for
in
company
I
be
very
rarely
notice
;
and
if
Bessie
have
but
be
kind
and
companionable
,
I
should
have
deem
it
a
treat
to
spend
the
evening
quietly
with
her
,
instead
of
pass
them
under
the
formidable
eye
of
Mrs.
Reed
,
in
a
room
full
of
lady
and
gentleman
.
<EOS>
but
Bessie
,
as
soon
as
she
have
dress
her
young
lady
,
use
to
take
herself
off
to
the
lively
region
of
the
kitchen
and
housekeeper
's
room
,
generally
bear
the
candle
along
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
then
sit
with
my
doll
on
my
knee
till
the
fire
get
low
,
glance
round
occasionally
to
make
sure
that
nothing
bad
than
myself
haunt
the
shadowy
room
;
and
when
the
ember
sink
to
a
dull
red
,
I
undress
hastily
,
tugging
at
knot
and
string
as
I
best
may
,
and
seek
shelter
from
cold
and
darkness
in
my
crib
.
<EOS>
to
this
crib
I
always
take
my
doll
;
human
being
must
love
something
,
and
,
in
the
dearth
of
worthy
object
of
affection
,
I
contrive
to
find
a
pleasure
in
love
and
cherish
a
fade
graven
image
,
shabby
as
a
miniature
scarecrow
.
<EOS>
It
puzzle
me
now
to
remember
with
what
absurd
sincerity
I
doate
on
this
little
toy
,
half
fancy
it
alive
and
capable
of
sensation
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
sleep
unless
it
be
fold
in
my
night
-
gown
;
and
when
it
lie
there
safe
and
warm
,
I
be
comparatively
happy
,
believe
it
to
be
happy
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
long
do
the
hour
seem
while
I
wait
the
departure
of
the
company
,
and
listen
for
the
sound
of
Bessie
's
step
on
the
stair
:
sometimes
she
would
come
up
in
the
interval
to
seek
her
thimble
or
her
scissor
,
or
perhaps
to
bring
me
something
by
way
of
supper
 
<EOS>
a
bun
or
a
cheese
-
cake
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
sit
on
the
bed
while
I
eat
it
,
and
when
I
have
finish
,
she
would
tuck
the
clothe
round
me
,
and
twice
she
kiss
me
,
and
say
,
"
good
night
,
Miss
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
when
thus
gentle
,
Bessie
seem
to
me
the
good
,
prettiest
,
kindest
be
in
the
world
;
and
I
wish
most
intensely
that
she
would
always
be
so
pleasant
and
amiable
,
and
never
push
me
about
,
or
scold
,
or
task
me
unreasonably
,
as
she
be
too
often
will
not
to
do
.
<EOS>
Bessie
Lee
must
,
I
think
,
have
be
a
girl
of
good
natural
capacity
,
for
she
be
smart
in
all
she
do
,
and
have
a
remarkable
knack
of
narrative
;
so
,
at
least
,
I
judge
from
the
impression
make
on
me
by
her
nursery
tale
.
<EOS>
She
be
pretty
too
,
if
my
recollection
of
her
face
and
person
be
correct
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
as
a
slim
young
woman
,
with
black
hair
,
dark
eye
,
very
nice
feature
,
and
good
,
clear
complexion
;
but
she
have
a
capricious
and
hasty
temper
,
and
indifferent
idea
of
principle
or
justice
:
still
,
such
as
she
be
,
I
prefer
her
to
any
one
else
at
Gateshead
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
fifteenth
of
January
,
about
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
:
<EOS>
Bessie
be
go
down
to
breakfast
;
my
cousin
have
not
yet
be
summon
to
their
mama
;
Eliza
be
put
on
her
bonnet
and
warm
garden
-
coat
to
go
and
feed
her
poultry
,
an
occupation
of
which
she
be
fond
:
and
not
less
so
of
sell
the
egg
to
the
housekeeper
and
hoard
up
the
money
she
thus
obtain
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
turn
for
traffic
,
and
a
marked
propensity
for
saving
;
show
not
only
in
the
vending
of
egg
and
chicken
,
but
also
in
drive
hard
bargain
with
the
gardener
about
flower
-
root
,
seed
,
and
slip
of
plant
;
<EOS>
that
functionary
have
order
from
Mrs.
Reed
to
buy
of
his
young
lady
all
the
product
of
her
parterre
she
wish
to
sell
:
and
Eliza
would
have
sell
the
hair
off
her
head
if
she
could
have
make
a
handsome
profit
thereby
.
<EOS>
as
to
her
money
,
she
first
secrete
it
in
odd
corner
,
wrap
in
a
rag
or
an
old
curl
-
paper
;
but
some
of
these
hoard
have
be
discover
by
the
housemaid
,
Eliza
,
fearful
of
one
day
lose
her
value
treasure
,
consent
to
intrust
it
to
her
mother
,
at
a
usurious
rate
of
interest
 
fifty
or
sixty
per
cent
.
;
which
interest
she
exact
every
quarter
,
keep
her
account
in
a
little
book
with
anxious
accuracy
.
  
<EOS>
Georgiana
sit
on
a
high
stool
,
dress
her
hair
at
the
glass
,
and
interweave
her
curl
with
artificial
flower
and
fade
feather
,
of
which
she
have
find
a
store
in
a
drawer
in
the
attic
.
<EOS>
I
be
make
my
bed
,
have
receive
strict
order
from
Bessie
to
get
it
arrange
before
she
return
(
for
Bessie
now
frequently
employ
me
as
a
sort
of
under-
nurserymaid
,
to
tidy
the
room
,
dust
the
chair
,
&
c.
)
.
<EOS>
have
spread
the
quilt
and
fold
my
night
-
dress
,
I
go
to
the
window
-
seat
to
put
in
order
<EOS>
some
picture
-
book
and
doll
's
house
furniture
scatter
there
;
an
abrupt
command
from
Georgiana
to
let
her
plaything
alone
(
for
the
tiny
chair
and
mirror
,
the
fairy
plate
and
cup
,
be
her
property
)
stop
my
proceeding
;
and
then
,
for
lack
of
other
occupation
,
I
fall
to
breathe
on
the
frost
-
flower
with
which
the
window
be
fret
,
and
thus
clear
a
space
in
the
glass
through
which
I
may
look
out
on
the
ground
,
where
all
be
still
and
petrify
under
the
influence
of
a
hard
frost
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
window
be
visible
the
porter
's
lodge
and
the
carriage
-
road
,
and
just
as
I
have
dissolve
so
much
of
the
silver
-
white
foliage
veil
the
pane
as
left
room
to
look
out
,
I
see
the
gate
throw
open
and
a
carriage
roll
through
.
<EOS>
I
watch
it
ascend
the
drive
with
indifference
;
carriage
often
come
to
Gateshead
,
but
none
ever
bring
visitor
in
whom
I
be
interested
;
it
stop
in
front
of
the
house
,
the
door
-
bell
ring
loudly
,
the
new
-
comer
be
admit
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
nothing
to
me
,
my
vacant
attention
soon
find
lively
attraction
in
the
spectacle
of
a
little
hungry
robin
,
which
come
and
chirrup
on
the
twig
of
the
leafless
cherry
-
tree
nail
against
the
wall
near
the
casement
.
<EOS>
the
remain
of
my
breakfast
of
bread
and
milk
stand
on
the
table
,
and
have
crumble
a
morsel
of
roll
,
I
be
tug
at
the
sash
to
put
out
the
crumb
on
the
window
-
sill
,
when
Bessie
come
run
upstairs
into
the
nursery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Jane
,
take
off
your
pinafore
;
what
be
you
do
there
?
<EOS>
have
you
wash
your
hand
and
face
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
I
give
another
tug
before
I
answer
,
for
I
want
the
bird
to
be
secure
of
its
bread
:
the
sash
yield
;
I
scatter
the
crumb
,
some
on
the
stone
sill
,
some
on
the
cherry
-
tree
bough
,
then
,
close
the
window
,
I
reply
    
"
<EOS>
no
,
Bessie
;
I
have
only
just
finish
dust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
troublesome
,
careless
child
!
<EOS>
and
what
be
you
do
now
?
<EOS>
You
look
quite
red
,
as
if
you
have
be
about
some
mischief
:
what
be
you
open
the
window
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
spare
the
trouble
of
answer
,
for
<EOS>
Bessie
seem
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
listen
to
explanation
;
she
haul
me
to
the
washstand
,
inflict
a
merciless
,
but
happily
brief
scrub
on
my
face
and
hand
with
soap
,
water
,
and
a
coarse
towel
;
discipline
my
head
with
a
bristly
brush
,
denude
me
of
my
pinafore
,
and
then
hurry
me
to
the
top
of
the
stair
,
bid
me
go
down
directly
,
as
I
be
want
in
the
breakfast
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
ask
who
want
me
:
I
would
have
demand
if
Mrs.
Reed
be
there
;
but
Bessie
be
already
go
,
and
have
close
the
nursery
-
door
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
slowly
descend
.
<EOS>
for
nearly
three
month
,
I
have
never
be
call
to
Mrs.
Reed
's
presence
;
restrict
so
long
to
the
nursery
,
the
breakfast
,
dining
,
and
drawing
-
room
be
become
for
me
awful
region
,
on
which
it
dismay
me
to
intrude
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
stand
in
the
empty
hall
;
before
me
be
the
breakfast
-
room
door
,
and
I
stop
,
intimidate
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
what
a
miserable
little
poltroon
have
fear
,
engender
of
unjust
punishment
,
make
of
me
in
those
day
!
<EOS>
I
fear
to
return
to
the
nursery
,
and
fear
to
go
forward
to
the
parlour
;
ten
minute
I
stand
in
agitated
hesitation
;
the
vehement
ringing
of
the
breakfast
-
room
bell
decide
me
;
I
_
must
_
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
could
want
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
inwardly
,
as
with
both
hand
I
turn
the
stiff
door
-
handle
,
which
,
for
a
second
or
two
,
resist
my
effort
.
<EOS>
"
what
should
I
see
besides
Aunt
Reed
in
the
apartment
?
 
<EOS>
a
man
or
a
woman
?
<EOS>
"
the
handle
turn
,
the
door
unclosed
,
and
pass
through
and
curtsey
low
,
I
look
up
at
 
a
black
pillar
!
 
<EOS>
such
,
at
least
,
appear
to
me
,
at
first
sight
,
the
straight
,
narrow
,
sable
-
clothe
shape
stand
erect

Mrs.

a
signal
to
me
to
approach
;
I
do
so

and
she
introduce
me
to
the
stony
stranger
with
the
word
:

look
up

then
I
be
very
little

his

be
large

they

equally
harsh

well

how

<EOS>
"
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
I
believe
I
intimate
in
the
letter
which
I
write
to
you
three
week
ago
,
that
this
little
girl
have
not
quite
the
character
and
disposition
I
could
wish
:
should
you
admit
her
into
Lowood
school
,
I
should
be
glad
if
the
superintendent
and
teacher
be
request
to
keep
a
strict
eye
on
her
,
and
,
above
all
,
to
guard
against
her
bad
fault
,
a
tendency
to
deceit
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
in
your
hearing
,
Jane
,
that
you
may
not
attempt
to
impose
on
Mr.
Brocklehurst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
well
may
I
dread
,
well
may
I
dislike
Mrs.
Reed
;
for
it
be
her
nature
to
wound
me
cruelly
;
never
be
I
happy
in
her
presence
<EOS>
;
however
carefully
I
obey
,
however
strenuously
I
strove
to
please
her

my
effort
be
still

repay
by
such
sentence
as
the
above
.
<EOS>
now
,
utter
before
a
stranger
,
the
accusation
cut
me
to
the
heart
;
I
dimly
perceive
that
she
be
already
obliterate
hope
from
the
new
phase
of
existence
which
she
destine
me
to
enter
;
I
feel
,
though
I
could
not
have
express
the
feeling
,
that
she
be
sow
aversion
and
unkindness
along
my
future
path
;
I
see
myself
transform
under
Mr.
Brocklehurst
's
eye
into
an
artful
,
noxious
child
,
and
what
could
I
do
to
remedy
the
injury
?
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
indeed
,
"
think
I
,
as
I
struggle
to
repress
a
sob

and
hastily
wipe
away
some
tear

the
impotent
evidence
of
my
anguish

<EOS>
"
Deceit
be
,
indeed
,
a
sad
fault
in

Mr.

akin

humility

I

murmur
<EOS>
Mrs.

_
sotto
voce

;
and
gather
up
her
work
,
she
abruptly
quit
the
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
leave
there
alone
 
winner
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
hard
battle
I
have
fight
,
and
the
first
victory
I
have
gain
<EOS>
:
I
stand
awhile
on
the
rug
,
where
Mr.
Brocklehurst
have
stand
,
and
I
enjoy
my
conqueror
's
solitude
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
smile
to
myself
and
feel
elate
;
but
this
fierce
pleasure
subside
in
me
as
fast
as
do
the
accelerated
throb
of
my
pulse
.
<EOS>
a
child
can
not
quarrel
with
its
elder
,
as
I
have
do
;
can
not
give
its
furious
feeling
uncontrolle
play
,
as
I
have
give
mine
,
without
experience
afterwards
the
pang
of
remorse
and
the
chill
of
reaction
.
<EOS>
a
ridge
of
light
heath
,
alive
,
glancing
,
devour
,
would
have
be
a
meet
emblem
of
my
mind
when
I
accuse
and
menace
Mrs.
Reed
:
the
same
ridge
,
black
and
blast
after
the
flame
be
dead
,
would
have
represent
as
meetly
my
subsequent
condition
,
when
half
-
an
-
hour
's
silence
and
reflection
have
show
me
the
madness
of
my
conduct
,
and
the
dreariness
of
my
hate
and
hate
position
.
  
<EOS>
something
of
vengeance
I
have
taste
for
the
first
time
;
as
aromatic
wine
it
seem
,
on
swallow
,
warm
and
racy
:
its
after
-
flavour
,
metallic
and
corrode
,
give
me
a
sensation
as
if
I
have
be
poison
.
<EOS>
willingly
would
I
now
have
go
and
ask
Mrs.
Reed
's
pardon
;
but
I
know
,
partly
from
experience
and
partly
from
instinct
,
that
be
the
way
to
make
her
repulse
me
with
double
scorn
,
thereby
re
-
exciting
every
turbulent
impulse
of
my
nature
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
fain
exercise
some
well
faculty
than
that
of
fierce
speaking
;
fain
find
nourishment
for
some
less
fiendish
feeling
than
that
of
sombre
indignation
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
book
 
some
arabian
tale
;
I
sit
down
and
endeavour
to
read
.
<EOS>
I
could
make
no
sense
of
the
subject
;
my
own
thought
swam
always
between
me
and
the
page
I
have
usually
find
fascinating
.
<EOS>
I
open
the
glass
-
door
in
the
breakfast
-
room
:
<EOS>
the
shrubbery
be
quite
still
:
the
black
frost
reign
,
unbroken
by
sun
or
breeze
,
through
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
cover
my
head
and
arm
with
the
skirt
of
my
frock
,
and
go
out
to
walk
in
a
part
of
the
plantation
which
be
quite
sequestrated
;
but
I
find
no
pleasure
in
the
silent
tree
,
the
fall
fir
-
cone
,
the
congeal
relic
of
autumn
,
russet
leave
,
sweep
by
past
wind
in
heap
,
and
now
stiffen
together
.
<EOS>
I
lean
against
a
gate
,
and
look
into
an
empty
field
where
no
sheep
be
feed
,
where
the
short
grass
be
nip
and
blanch
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
grey
day
;
a
most
opaque
sky
,
"
onde
on
snaw
,
"
canopy
all
;
thence
flake
feel
it
interval
,
which
settle
on
the
hard
path
and
on
the
hoary
lea
without
melt
.
<EOS>
I
stand
,
a
wretched
child
enough
,
whisper
to
myself
over
and
over
again
,
"
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
all
at
once
I
hear
a
clear
voice
call
,
"
Miss
Jane
!
<EOS>
where
be
you
?
<EOS>
come
to
lunch
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
Bessie
<EOS>
,
I
know
well
enough
;
but
I
do
not
stir
;
her
light
step
come
trip
down
the
path
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
naughty
little
thing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
come
when
you
be
call
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
's
presence
,
compare
with
the
thought
over
which
I
have
be
brood
,
seem
cheerful
;
even
though
,
as
usual
,
she
be
somewhat
cross
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
after
my
conflict
with
and
victory
over
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
be
not
dispose
to
care
much
for
the
nursemaid
's
transitory
anger
;
and
I
_
be
_
dispose
to
bask
in
her
youthful
lightness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
I
just
put
my
two
arm
round
her
and
say
,
"
come
,
Bessie
!
<EOS>
do
not
scold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
action
be
more
frank
and
fearless
than
any
I
be
habituate
to
indulge
in
:
somehow
it
please
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
strange
child
,
Miss
Jane
,
"
she
say
,
as
she
look
down
at
me
;
"
a
little
roving
,
solitary
thing
:
<EOS>
and
you
be
go
to
school
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
nod
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
not
you
be
sorry
to
leave
poor
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
Bessie
care
for
me
?
<EOS>
She
be
always
scold
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
you
be
such
a
queer
,
frightened
,
shy
little
thing

<EOS>
You
should
be
bold

<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
to
get
more
knock
?

"
  
<EOS>

nonsense

put
upon

My

say
,
when
she
come
to
see
me
last
week
,
that
she
would
not
like
a
little
one
of
her
own

come
in
,

go
out

something
about

have

between

Bessie
stoop
;
we
mutually
embrace
,
and
I
follow
her
into
the
house
quite
comfort

<EOS>
that
afternoon
lapse
in
peace
and
harmony

and
in
the
evening
Bessie
tell
me
some
of
her
most
enchanting
story

sing
me
some
of
her
sweetest
song

five
o'clock

hardly
strike
on
the
morning
of

19th
of
January

when
Bessie
bring
a
candle
into
my
closet

find
me
already
up
and
nearly
dress
.
<EOS>
I
have
rise
half
-
an
-
hour
before
her
entrance
,
and
have
wash
my
face
,
and
put
on
my
clothe
by
the
light
of
a
half
-
moon
just
set
,
whose
ray
stream
through
the
narrow
window
near
my
crib

I
be
to
leave
Gateshead
that
day
by
a
coach
which
pass
the

gate
at
six
a.m.
Bessie

person
yet
rise
;
she
have
light
a
fire
in
the
nursery
,
where
she
now
proceed
to
make
my
breakfast
.
<EOS>
few
child
can
eat
when
excited
with
the
thought

a
journey
;
nor
could
I.
Bessie

have
press
me
in
vain
to
take
a
few
spoonful
of
the
boil
milk
and
bread
she
have
prepare
for
me
,
wrap
up
some
biscuit
in
a
paper

put
them
into

she
help
me
on
with
my

wrap
herself
in

Miss

It

Your

"
<EOS>
cry
I
,
as
we
pass
through
the
hall
and
go
out
at
the
front
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
moon
be
set
,
and
it
be
very
dark
;
Bessie
carry
a
lantern
,
whose
light
glance
on
wet
step
and
gravel
road
sodden
by
a
recent
thaw
.
<EOS>
raw
and
chill
be
the
winter
morning
:
<EOS>
my
tooth
chatter
as
I
hasten
down
the
drive
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
light
in
the
porter
's
lodge
:
when
we
reach
it
,
we
find
the
porter
's
wife
just
kindle
her
fire
:
<EOS>
my
trunk
,
which
have
be
carry
down
the
evening
before
,
stand
corded
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
want
but
a
few
minute
of
six
,
and
shortly
after
that
hour
have
strike
,
the
distant
roll
of
wheel
announce
the
come
coach
;
I
go
to
the
door
and
watch
its
lamp
approach
rapidly
through
the
gloom
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
go
by
herself
?
"
ask
the
porter
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
far
be
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
fifty
mile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
long
way
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
Mrs.
Reed
be
not
afraid
to
trust
her
so
far
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
coach
draw
up
;
there
it
be
at
the
gate
with
its
four
horse
and
its
top
laden
with
passenger
:
the
guard
and
coachman
loudly
urge
haste
;
my
trunk
be
hoist
up
;
I
be
take
from
Bessie
's
neck
,
to
which
I
cling
with
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
sure
and
take
good
care
of
her
,
"
cry
she
to
the
guard
,
as
he
lift
me
into
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
"
be
the
answer
:
the
door
be
slap
to
,
a
voice
exclaim
"
all
right
,
"
and
on
we
drive
.
<EOS>
thus
be
I
sever
from
Bessie
and
Gateshead
;
thus
whirl
away
to
unknown
,
and
,
as
I
then
deem
,
remote
and
mysterious
region
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
but
little
of
the
journey
;
I
only
know
that
the
day
seem
to
me
of
a
preternatural
length
,
and
that
we
appear
to
travel
over
hundred
of
mile
of
road
.
<EOS>
We
pass
through
several
town
,
and
in
one
,
a
very
large
one
,
the
coach
stop
;
the
horse
be
take
out
,
and
the
passenger
alight
to
dine
.
<EOS>
I
be
carry
into
an
inn
,
where
the
guard
want
me
to
have
some
dinner
;
but
,
as
I
have
no
appetite
,
he
leave
me
in
an
immense
room
with
a
fireplace
at
each
end
,
a
chandelier
pendent
from
the
ceiling
,
and
a
little
red
gallery
high
up
against
the
wall
fill
with
musical
instrument
.
<EOS>
here
I
walk
about
for
a
long
time
,
feel
very
strange
,
and
mortally
apprehensive
of
some
one
come
in
and
kidnap
me
;
for
I
believe
in
kidnapper
,
their
exploit
have
frequently
figure
in
Bessie
's
fireside
chronicle
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
guard
return
;
once
more
I
be
stow
away
in
the
coach
,
my
protector
mount
his
own
seat
,
sound
his
hollow
horn
,
and
away
we
rattle
over
the
"
stony
street
"
of
L-
.
  
<EOS>
the
afternoon
come
on
wet
and
somewhat
misty
:
as
it
wane
into
dusk
,
I
begin
to
feel
that
we
be
get
very
far
indeed
from
Gateshead
:
we
cease
to
pass
through
town
;
the
country
change
;
great
grey
hill
heave
up
round
the
horizon
:
as
twilight
deepen
,
we
descend
a
valley
,
dark
with
wood
,
and
long
after
night
have
overcloud
the
prospect
,
I
hear
a
wild
wind
rush
amongst
tree
.
  
<EOS>
lull
by
the
sound
,
I
at
last
drop
asleep
;
I
have
not
long
slumber
when
the
sudden
cessation
of
motion
awake
me
;
the
coach
-
door
be
open
,
and
a
person
like
a
servant
be
stand
at
it
:
<EOS>
I
see
her
face
and
dress
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
a
little
girl
call
Jane
Eyre
here
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
.
<EOS>
I
answer
"
yes
,
"
and
be
then
lift
out
;
my
trunk
be
hand
down
,
and
the
coach
instantly
drive
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
stiff
with
long
sit
,
and
bewilder
with
the
noise
and
motion
of
the
coach
:
<EOS>
gather
my
faculty
,
I
look
about
me
.
<EOS>
rain
,
wind
,
and
darkness
fill
the
air
;
nevertheless
,
I
dimly
discern
a
wall
before
me
and
a
door
open
in
it
;
through
this
door
I
pass
with
my
new
guide
:
she
shut
and
lock
it
behind
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
visible
a
house
or
house
 
for
the
building
spread
far
 
with
many
window
,
and
light
burn
in
some
;
we
go
up
a
broad
pebbly
path
,
splash
wet
,
and
be
admit
at
a
door
;
then
the
servant
lead
me
through
a
passage
into
a
room
with
a
fire
,
where
she
leave
me
alone
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
and
warm
my
numbed
finger
over
the
blaze
<EOS>
,
then
I
look
round
;
there
be
no
candle
,
but
the
uncertain
light
from
the
hearth
show
,
by
interval
,
papered
wall
,
carpet
,
curtain
,
shine
mahogany
furniture
<EOS>
:
it
be
a
parlour
,
not
so
spacious
or
splendid
as
the
drawing
-
room
at
Gateshead
,
but
comfortable
enough
.
<EOS>
I
be
puzzle
to
make
out
the
subject
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
,
when
the
door
open
,
and
an
individual
carry
a
light
enter
;
another
follow
close
behind
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
be
a
tall
lady
with
dark
hair
,
dark
eye
,
and
a
pale
and
large
forehead
;
her
figure
be
partly
envelop
in
a
shawl
,
her
countenance
be
grave
,
her
bearing
erect
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
child
be
very
young
to
be
send
alone
,
"
say
she
,
put
her
candle
down
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
She
consider
me
attentively
for
a
minute
or
two
,
then
further
add
    
"
<EOS>
She
have
better
be
put
to
bed
soon
;
she
look
tired
:
be
you
tired
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
place
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
little
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
hungry
too
,
no
doubt
:
let
her
have
some
supper
before
she
go
to
bed
,
Miss
Miller
.
<EOS>
be
this
the
first
time
you
have
leave
your
parent
to
come
to
school
,
my
little
girl
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
explain
to
her
that
I
have
no
parent
.
<EOS>
She
inquire
how
long
they
have
be
dead
:
then
how
old
I
be
,
what
be
my
name
,
whether
I
could
read
,
write
,
and
sew
a
little
:
then
she
touch
my
cheek
gently
with
her
forefinger
,
and
say
,
"
She
hope
I
should
be
a
good
child
,
"
dismiss
me
along
with
Miss
Miller
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
I
have
leave
may
be
about
twenty
-
nine
;
the
one
who
go
with
me
appear
some
year
young
:
<EOS>
the
first
impress
me
by
her
voice
,
look
,
and
air
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
be
more
ordinary
;
ruddy
in
complexion
,
though
of
a
careworn
countenance
;
hurry
in
gait
and
action
,
like
one
who
have
always
a
multiplicity
of
task
on
hand
<EOS>
:
she
look
,
indeed
,
what
I
afterwards
find
she
really
be
,
an
under
-
teacher
.
<EOS>
lead
by
her
,
I
pass
from
compartment
to
compartment
,
from
passage
to
passage
,
of
a
large
and
irregular
building
;
till
,
emerge
from
the
total
and
somewhat
dreary
silence
pervade
that
portion
of
the
house
we
have
traverse
,
we
come
upon
the
hum
of
many
voice
,
and
presently
enter
a
wide
,
long
room
,
with
great
deal
table
,
two
at
each
end
,
on
each
of
which
burn
a
pair
of
candle
,
and
seat
all
round
on
bench
,
a
congregation
of
girl
of
every
age
,
from
nine
or
ten
to
twenty
.
<EOS>
see
by
the
dim
light
of
the
dip
,
their
number
to
me
appear
countless
,
though
not
in
reality
exceed
eighty
;
they
be
uniformly
dress
in
brown
stuff
frock
of
quaint
fashion
,
and
long
holland
pinafore
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
hour
of
study
;
they
be
engage
in
con
over
their
to
-
morrow
's
task
,
and
the
hum
I
have
hear
be
the
combined
result
of
their
whisper
repetition
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
sign
to
me
to
sit
on
a
bench
near
the
door
,
then
walk
up
to
the
top
of
the
long
room
she
cry
out
    
"
monitor
,
collect
the
lesson
-
book
and
put
them
away
!
"
  
<EOS>
four
tall
girl
arise
from
different
table
,
and
go
round
,
gather
the
book
and
remove
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
again
give
the
word
of
command
    
"
Monitors
,
fetch
the
supper
-
tray
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
tall
girl
go
out
and
return
presently
,
each
bear
a
tray
,
with
portion
of
something
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
,
arrange
thereon
,
and
a
pitcher
of
water
and
mug
in
the
middle
of
each
tray
.
<EOS>
the
portion
be
hand
round
;
those
who
like
take
a
draught
of
the
water
,
the
mug
be
common
to
all
.
<EOS>
when
it
come
to
my
turn
,
I
drink
,
for
I
be
thirsty
,
but
do
not
touch
the
food
,
excitement
and
fatigue
render
me
incapable
of
eat
:
<EOS>
I
now
see
,
however
,
that
it
be
a
thin
oaten
cake
share
into
fragment
.
  
<EOS>
the
meal
over
,
prayer
be
read
by
Miss
Miller
,
and
the
class
file
off
,
two
and
two
,
upstairs
.
<EOS>
overpower
by
this
time
with
weariness
,
I
scarcely
notice
what
sort
of
a
place
the
bedroom
be
,
except
that
,
like
the
schoolroom
,
I
see
it
be
very
long
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
I
be
to
be
Miss
Miller
's
bed
-
fellow
;
she
help
me
to
undress
:
when
lay
down
I
glance
at
the
long
row
of
bed
,
each
of
which
be
quickly
fill
with
two
occupant
;
in
ten
minute
the
single
light
be
extinguish
,
and
amidst
silence
and
complete
darkness
I
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
pass
rapidly
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
tired
even
to
dream
;
I
only
once
awake
to
hear
the
wind
rave
in
furious
gust
,
and
the
rain
fall
in
torrent
,
and
to
be
sensible
that
Miss
Miller
have
take
her
place
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
when
I
again
unclose
my
eye
,
a
loud
bell
be
ring
;
the
girl
be
up
and
dress
;
day
have
not
yet
begin
to
dawn
,
and
a
rushlight
or
two
burn
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
too
rise
reluctantly
;
it
be
bitter
cold
,
and
I
dress
as
well
as
I
could
for
shivering
,
and
wash
when
there
be
a
basin
at
liberty
,
which
do
not
occur
soon
,
as
there
be
but
one
basin
to
six
girl
,
on
the
stand
down
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
again
the
bell
rang
:
all
form
in
file
,
two
and
two
,
and
in
that
order
descend
the
stair
and
enter
the
cold
and
dimly
light
schoolroom
:
here
prayer
be
read
by
Miss
Miller
;
afterwards
she
call
out
    
"
form
class

"
  
<EOS>
a
great
tumult
succeed
for
some
minute
,
during
which
Miss
Miller
repeatedly
exclaim
,
"
silence
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
order
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
it
subside
,
I
see
them
all
draw
up
in
four
semicircle
,
before
four
chair
,
place
at
the
four
table
;
all
hold
book
in
their
hand
,
and
a
great
book
,
like
a
Bible
,
lie
on
each
table
,
before
the
vacant
seat
.
<EOS>
a
pause
of
some
second
succeed
,
fill
up
by
the
low
,
vague
hum
of
number
;
Miss
Miller
walk
from
class
to
class
,
hush
this
indefinite
sound
.
  
<EOS>
a
distant
bell
tinkle
:
immediately
three
lady
enter
the
room
<EOS>
,
each
walk
to
a
table
and
take
her
seat
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
assume
the
fourth
vacant
chair
,
which
be
that
near
the
door
,
and
around
which
the
small
of
the
child
be
assemble
:
to
this
inferior
class
I
be
call
,
and
place
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
business
now
begin
,
the
day
's
Collect
be
repeat
,
then
certain
text
of
scripture
be
say
,
and
to
these
succeed
a
protract
reading
of
chapter
in
the
Bible
,
which
last
an
hour
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
that
exercise
be
terminate
,
day
have
fully
dawn
.
<EOS>
the
indefatigable
bell
now
sound
for
the
fourth
time
:
the
class
be
marshal
and
march
into
another
room
to
breakfast
:
<EOS>
how
glad
I
be
to
behold
a
prospect
of
get
something
to
eat
!
<EOS>
I
be
now
nearly
sick
from
inanition
,
have
take
so
little
the
day
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
refectory
be
a
great
,
low
-
ceile
,
gloomy
room
;
on
two
long
table
smoke
basin
of
something
hot
,
which
,
however
,
to
my
dismay
,
send
forth
an
odour
far
from
invite
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
universal
manifestation
of
discontent
when
the
fume
of
the
repast
meet
the
nostril
of
those
destine
to
swallow
it
;
from
the
van
of
the
procession
,
the
tall
girl
of
the
first
class
,
rise
the
whisper
word
    
"
Disgusting

<EOS>
the
porridge
be
burn
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
silence

"
<EOS>
ejaculate
a
voice
;
not
that
of
Miss
Miller
,
but
one
of
the
upper
teacher
,
a
little
and
dark
personage
,
smartly
dress
,
but
of
somewhat
morose
aspect
,
who
instal
herself
at
the
top
of
one
table
,
while
a
more
buxom
lady
preside
at
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
look
in
vain
for
her
<EOS>
I
have
first
see
the
night
before
;
she
be
not
visible
:
Miss
Miller
occupy
the
foot
of
the
table
where
I
sit
,
and
a
strange
,
foreign
-
looking
,
elderly
lady
,
the
french
teacher
,
as
I
afterwards
find
,
take
the
corresponding
seat
at
the
other
board
.
<EOS>
a
long
grace
be
say
and
a
hymn
sing
;
then
a
servant
bring
in
some
tea
for
the
teacher
,
and
the
meal
begin
.
  
<EOS>
ravenous
,
and
now
very
faint
<EOS>
,
I
devour
a
spoonful
or
two
of
my
portion
without
think
of
its
taste
;
but
the
first
edge
of
hunger
blunt
,
I
perceive
I
have
get
in
hand
a
nauseous
mess
;
burn
porridge
be
almost
as
bad
as
rotten
potato
;
famine
itself
soon
sicken
over
it
.
<EOS>
the
spoon
be
move
slowly
:
I
see
each
girl
taste
her
food
and
try
to
swallow
it
;
but
in
most
case
the
effort
be
soon
relinquish
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
be
over
,
and
none
have
breakfast
.
<EOS>
thank
be
return
for
what
we
have
not
get
,
and
a
second
hymn
chant
,
the
refectory
be
evacuate
for
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
I
be
one
of
the
last
to
go
out
,
and
in
pass
the
table
,
I
see
one
teacher
take
a
basin
of
the
porridge
and
taste
it
;
she
look
at
the
other
;
all
their
countenance
express
displeasure
,
and
one
of
them
,
the
stout
one
,
whisper
    
"
abominable
stuff
!
<EOS>
how
shameful
!
"
  
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
pass
before
lesson
again
begin
,
during
which
the
schoolroom
be
in
a
glorious
tumult
;
for
that
space
of
time
it
seem
to
be
permit
to
talk
loud
and
more
freely
,
and
they
use
their
privilege
.
<EOS>
the
whole
conversation
run
on
the
breakfast
,
which
one
and
all
abuse
roundly
.
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
it
be
the
sole
consolation
they
have
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
be
now
the
only
teacher
in
the
room
:
a
group
of
great
girl
stand
about
her
speak
with
serious
and
sullen
gesture
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
name
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
pronounce
by
some
lip
;
at
which
Miss
Miller
shake
her
head
disapprovingly
;
but
she
make
no
great
effort
to
check
the
general
wrath
;
doubtless
she
share
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
a
clock
in
the
schoolroom
strike
nine
;
Miss
Miller
leave
her
circle
,
and
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
cry
    
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
to
your
seat
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
discipline
prevail
:
in
five
minute
the
confused
throng
be
resolve
into
order
,
and
comparative
silence
quell
the
Babel
clamour
of
tongue
.
<EOS>
the
upper
teacher
now
punctually
resume
their
post
:
but
still
,
all
seem
to
wait
.
<EOS>
range
on
bench
down
the
side
of
the
room
,
the
eighty
girl
sit
motionless
and
erect
;
a
quaint
assemblage
they
appear
,
all
with
plain
lock
comb
from
their
face
,
not
a
curl
visible
;
in
brown
dress
,
make
high
and
surround
by
a
narrow
tucker
about
the
throat
,
with
little
pocket
of
holland
(
shape
something
like
a
Highlander
's
purse
)
tie
in
front
of
their
frock
,
and
destine
to
serve
the
purpose
of
a
work
-
bag
:
all
,
too
,
wear
woollen
stocking
and
country
-
make
shoe
,
fasten
with
brass
buckle
.
<EOS>
above
twenty
of
those
clothe
in
this
costume
be
full
-
grow
girl
,
or
rather
young
woman
;
it
suit
them
ill
,
and
give
an
air
of
oddity
even
to
the
prettiest
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
still
look
at
them
,
and
also
at
interval
examine
the
teacher
 
<EOS>
none
of
whom
precisely
please
me
;
for
the
stout
one
be
a
little
coarse
,
the
dark
one
not
a
little
fierce
,
the
foreigner
harsh
and
grotesque
,
and
Miss
Miller
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
look
purple
,
weather
-
beat
,
and
over
-
work
 
<EOS>
when
,
as
my
eye
wander
from
face
to
face
,
the
whole
school
rise
simultaneously
,
as
if
move
by
a
common
spring
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
I
have
hear
no
order
give
:
I
be
puzzle
.
<EOS>
Ere
I
have
gather
my
wit
,
the
class
be
again
seat
:
but
as
all
eye
be
now
turn
to
one
point
,
mine
follow
the
general
direction
,
and
encounter
the
personage
who
have
receive
me
last
night
.
<EOS>
She
stand
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
room
,
on
the
hearth
;
for
there
be
a
fire
at
each
end
;
she
survey
the
two
row
of
girl
silently
and
gravely
.
<EOS>
Miss
Miller
approach
,
seem
to
ask
her
a
question
,
and
have
receive
her
answer
,
go
back
to
her
place
,
and
say
aloud
    
"
Monitor
of
the
first
class
,
fetch
the
globe
!
"
  
<EOS>
while
the
direction
be
be
execute
,
the
lady
consult
move
slowly
up
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
a
considerable
organ
of
veneration
,
for
I
retain
yet
the
sense
of
admire
awe
with
which
my
eye
trace
her
step
.
<EOS>
see
now
,
in
broad
daylight
,
she
look
tall
,
fair
,
and
shapely
;
brown
eye
with
a
benignant
light
in
their
irid
,
and
a
fine
pencilling
of
long
lash
round
,
relieve
the
whiteness
of
her
large
front
;
on
each
of
her
temple
<EOS>
her
hair
,
of
a
very
dark
brown
,
be
cluster
in
round
curl
,
accord
to
the
fashion
of
those
time
,
when
neither
smooth
band
nor
long
ringlet
be
in
vogue
;
her
dress
,
also
in
the
mode
of
the
day
,
be
of
purple
cloth
,
relieve
by
a
sort
of
spanish
trimming
of
black
velvet
;
a
gold
watch
(
watch
be
not
so
common
then
as
now
)
shone
at
her
girdle
.
<EOS>
let
the
reader
add
,
to
complete
the
picture
,
refined
feature
;
a
complexion
,
if
pale
,
clear
;
and
a
stately
air
and
carriage
,
and
he
will
have
,
at
least
,
as
clearly
as
word
can
give
it
,
a
correct
idea
of
the
exterior
of
Miss
Temple
 
Maria
Temple
,
as
I
afterwards
see
the
name
write
in
a
prayer
-
book
intrust
to
me
to
carry
to
church
.
  
<EOS>
the
superintendent
of
Lowood
(
for
such
be
this
lady
)
have
take
her
seat
before
a
pair
of
globe
place
on
one
of
the
table
,
summon
the
first
class
round
her

and
commence
give
a
lesson
on
geography

hour

writing

arithmetic

,
and
music
lesson
be
give
by
Miss
Temple
to
some
of
the
eld
girl
.
<EOS>
the
duration
of
each
lesson
be
measure
by
the
clock
,
which
at
last
strike
twelve
.
<EOS>
the
superintendent
rise
    
"
I
have
a
word
to
address
to
the
pupil

"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
the
tumult
of
cessation
from
lesson
be
already
break
forth
,
but
it
sink
at
her
voice
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
    
<EOS>
"
You
have
this
morning
a
breakfast
which
you
could
not
eat
;
you
must
be
hungry
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
order
that
a
lunch
of
bread
and
cheese
shall
be
serve
to
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
teacher
look
at
her
with
a
sort
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
be
do
on
my
responsibility
,
"
she
add
,
in
an
explanatory
tone
to
them
,
and
immediately
afterwards
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
bread
and
cheese
be
presently
bring
in
and
distribute
,
to
the
high
delight
and
refreshment
of
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
the
order
be
now
give
"
to
the
garden
!
"
<EOS>
each
put
on
a
coarse
straw
bonnet
,
with
string
of
coloured
calico
,
and
a
cloak
of
grey
frieze
.
<EOS>
I
be
similarly
equip
,
and
,
follow
the
stream
,
I
make
my
way
into
the
open
air
.
  
<EOS>
the
garden
be
a
wide
inclosure
,
surround
with
wall
so
high
as
to
exclude
every
glimpse
of
prospect
;
a
cover
verandah
run
down
one
side
,
and
broad
walk
border
a
middle
space
divide
into
score
of
little
bed
:
these
bed
be
assign
as
garden
for
the
pupil
to
cultivate
,
and
each
bed
have
an
owner
.
<EOS>
when
full
of
flower
they
would
doubtless
look
pretty
;
but
now
,
at
the
latter
end
of
January
,
all
be
wintry
blight
and
brown
decay
.
<EOS>
I
shudder
as
I
stand
and
look
round
me
:
it
be
an
inclement
day
for
outdoor
exercise
;
not
positively
rainy
,
but
darken
by
a
drizzling
yellow
fog
;
all
under
foot
be
still
soak
wet
with
the
flood
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
the
strong
among
the
girl
run
about
and
engage
in
active
game
,
but
sundry
pale
and
thin
one
herd
together
for
shelter
and
warmth
in
the
verandah
;
and
amongst
these
,
as
the
dense
mist
penetrate
to
their
shivering
frame
<EOS>
,
I
hear
frequently
the
sound
of
a
hollow
cough
.
  
<EOS>
as
yet
I
have
speak
to
no
one
,
nor
do
anybody
seem
to
take
notice
of
me
<EOS>
;
I
stand
lonely
enough
:
but
to
that
feeling
of
isolation
<EOS>
I
be
accustomed
;
it
do
not
oppress
me
much
.
<EOS>
I
leant
against
a
pillar
of
the
verandah
,
draw
my
grey
mantle
close
about
me
,
and
,
try
to
forget
the
cold
which
nip
me
without
,
and
the
unsatisfied
hunger
which
gnaw
me
within
,
deliver
myself
up
to
the
employment
of
watch
and
thinking
.
<EOS>
My
reflection
be
too
undefined
and
fragmentary
to
merit
record
:
I
hardly
yet
know
where
I
be
;
Gateshead
and
my
past
life
seem
float
away
to
an
immeasurable
distance
;
the
present
be
vague
and
strange
,
and
of
the
future
I
could
form
no
conjecture
.
<EOS>
I
look
round
the
convent
-
like
garden
,
and
then
up
at
the
house
 
<EOS>
a
large
building
,
half
of
which
seem
grey
and
old
,
the
other
half
quite
new
.
<EOS>
the
new
part
,
contain
the
schoolroom
and
dormitory
,
be
light
by
mullione
and
latticed
window
,
which
give
it
a
church
-
like
aspect
;
a
stone
tablet
over
the
door
bear
this
inscription
:
    
"
Lowood
Institution
.
 
<EOS>
this
portion
be
rebuild
A.D.
,
by
Naomi
Brocklehurst
,
of
Brocklehurst
Hall
,
in
this
county
.
"
<EOS>
"
let
your
light
so
shine
before
man
,
that
they
may
see
your
good
work
,
and
glorify
your
Father
which
be
in
heaven
.
"
 
<EOS>
St.
Matt
.
<EOS>
v.
16
.
  
<EOS>
I
read
these
word
over
and
over
again
:
I
feel
that
an
explanation
belong
to
them
,
and
be
unable
fully
to
penetrate
their
import
.
<EOS>
I
be
still
ponder
the
signification
of
"
institution
,
"
and
endeavour
to
make
out
a
connection
between
the
first
word
and
the
verse
of
Scripture
,
when
the
sound
of
a
cough
close
behind
me
make
me
turn
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
girl
sit
on
a
stone
bench
near
;
she
be
bent
over
a
book
,
on
the
perusal
of
which
<EOS>
she
seem
intent
:
from
where
I
stand
I
could
see
the
title
 
<EOS>
it
be
"
Rasselas
;
"
a
name
that
strike
me
as
strange
,
and
consequently
attractive
.
<EOS>
in
turn
a
leaf
she
happen
to
look
up
,
and
I
say
to
her
directly
    
"
be
your
book
interesting
?
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
form
the
intention
of
ask
her
to
lend
it
to
me
some
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
it
,
"
she
answer
,
after
a
pause
of
a
second
or
two
,
during
which
she
examine
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
about
?
<EOS>
"
I
continue
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
where
I
find
the
hardihood
thus
to
open
a
conversation
with
a
stranger
;
the
step
be
contrary
to
my
nature
and
habit
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
her
occupation
touch
a
chord
of
sympathy
somewhere
;
for
I
too
like
reading
,
though
of
a
frivolous
and
childish
kind
;
I
could
not
digest
or
comprehend
the
serious
or
substantial
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
look
at
it
,
"
reply
the
girl
,
offer
me
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
so
;
a
brief
examination
convince
me
that
the
content
be
less
take
than
the
title
:
"
Rasselas
"
look
dull
to
my
trifling
taste
;
I
see
nothing
about
fairy
,
nothing
about
genii
;
no
bright
variety
seem
spread
over
the
closely
-
print
page
.
<EOS>
I
return
it
to
her
;
she
receive
it
quietly
,
and
without
say
anything
she
be
about
to
relapse
into
her
former
studious
mood
:
again
I
venture
to
disturb
her
    
"
Can
you
tell
me
what
the
writing
on
that
stone
over
the
door
mean

<EOS>
but
at
that
moment
the
summon
sound
for
dinner
;
all
re
-
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
odour
which
now
fill
the
refectory
be
scarcely
more
appetising
than
that
which
have
regale
our
nostril
at
breakfast
:
the
dinner
be
serve
in
two
huge
tin
-
plate
vessel
,
whence
rise
a
strong
steam
redolent
of
rancid
fat
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
mess
to
consist
of
indifferent
potato
and
strange
shred
of
rusty
meat
,
mixed
and
cook
together
.
<EOS>
of
this
preparation
a
tolerably
abundant
plateful
be
apportion
to
each
pupil
.
<EOS>
I
eat
what
I
could
,
and
wonder
within
myself
whether
every
day
's
fare
would
be
like
this
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
we
immediately
adjourn
to
the
schoolroom
:
lesson
recommence
,
and
be
continue
till
five
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
marked
event
of
the
afternoon
be
,
that
I
see
the
girl
with
whom
I
have
converse
in
the
verandah
dismiss
in
disgrace
by
Miss
Scatcherd
from
a
history
class
,
and
send
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
large
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
the
punishment
seem
to
me
in
a
high
degree
ignominious
,
especially
for
so
great
a
girl
 
<EOS>
she
look
thirteen
or
upwards
.
<EOS>
I
expect
she
would
show
sign
of
great
distress
and
shame
;
but
to
my
surprise
she
neither
weep
nor
blush
:
compose
,
though
grave
,
she
stand
,
the
central
mark
of
all
eye
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
she
bear
it
so
quietly
 
so
firmly
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
ask
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
be
I
in
her
place
,
it
seem
to
me
I
should
wish
the
earth
to
open
and
swallow
me
up
.
<EOS>
She
look
as
if
she
be
think
of
something
beyond
her
punishment
 
beyond
her
situation
:
of
something
not
round
her
nor
before
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
day
-
dream
 
<EOS>
be
she
in
a
day
-
dream
now
?
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
fix
on
the
floor
,
but
I
be
sure
they
do
not
see
it
 
<EOS>
her
sight
seem
turn
in
,
go
down
into
her
heart
:
she
be
look
at
what
she
can
remember
,
I
believe
;
not
at
what
be
really
present
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
girl
she
be
 
whether
good
or
naughty
.
"
  
<EOS>
soon
after
five
p.m.
we
have
another
meal
,
consist
of
a
small
mug
of
coffee
,
and
half
-
a
-
slice
of
brown
bread
.
<EOS>
I
devour
my
bread
and
drank
my
coffee
with
relish
;
but
I
should
have
be
glad
of
as
much
more
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
hungry
.
<EOS>
half
-
an
-
hour
's
recreation
succeed
,
then
study
;
then
the
glass
of
water
and
the
piece
of
oat
-
cake
,
prayer
,
and
bed
.
<EOS>
such
be
my
first
day
at
Lowood
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
day
commence
as
before
,
get
up
and
dress
by
rushlight
;
but
this
morning
we
be
oblige
to
dispense
with
the
ceremony
of
washing
;
the
water
in
the
pitcher
be
freeze
.
<EOS>
a
change
have
take
place
in
the
weather
the
precede
evening
,
and
a
keen
north
-
east
wind
,
whistle
through
the
crevice
of
our
bedroom
window
all
night
long
,
have
make
us
shiver
in
our
bed
,
and
turn
the
content
of
the
ewer
to
ice
.
  
<EOS>
before
the
long
hour
and
a
half
of
prayer
and
Bible
-
reading
be
over
,
I
feel
ready
to
perish
with
cold
.
<EOS>
breakfast
-
time
come
at
last
,
and
this
morning
the
porridge
be
not
burn
;
the
quality
be
eatable
,
the
quantity
small
.
<EOS>
how
small
my
portion
seem
!
<EOS>
I
wish
it
have
be
double
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
day
I
be
enrol
a
member
of
the
fourth
class
,
and
regular
task
and
occupation
be
assign
me
:
<EOS>
hitherto
,
I
have
only
be
a
spectator
of
the
proceeding
at
Lowood
;
I
be
now
to
become
an
actor
therein
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
be
little
accustomed
to
learn
by
heart
,
the
lesson
appear
to
me
both
long
and
difficult
;
the
frequent
change
from
task
to
task
,
too
,
bewilder
me
;
and
I
be
glad
when
,
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
Miss
Smith
put
into
my
hand
a
border
of
muslin
two
yard
long
,
together
with
needle
,
thimble
,
&
c.
,
and
send
me
to
sit
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
schoolroom
,
with
direction
to
hem
the
same
.
<EOS>
at
that
hour
most
of
the
other
be
sew
likewise
;
but
one
class
still
stand
round
Miss
Scatcherd
's
chair
reading
,
and
as
all
be
quiet
,
the
subject
of
their
lesson
could
be
hear
,
together
with
the
manner
in
which
each
girl
acquit
herself
,
and
the
animadversion
or
commendation
of
Miss
Scatcherd
on
the
performance
.
<EOS>
It
be
english
history
:
among
the
reader
I
observe
my
acquaintance
of
the
verandah
:
at
the
commencement
of
the
lesson
,
her
place
have
be
at
the
top
of
the
class
,
but
for
some
error
of
pronunciation
,
or
some
inattention
to
stop
,
she
be
suddenly
send
to
the
very
bottom
.
<EOS>
even
in
that
obscure
position
,
Miss
Scatcherd
continue
to
make
her
an
object
of
constant
notice
:
she
be
continually
address
to
her
such
phrase
as
the
following
:
    
"
Burns
"
(
<EOS>
such
it
seem
be
her
name
:
the
girl
here
be
all
call
by
their
surname
,
as
boy
be
elsewhere
)
,
"
Burns
,
you
be
stand
on
the
side
of
your
shoe
;
turn
your
toe
out
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
"
Burns
,
you
poke
your
chin
most
unpleasantly
;
draw
it
in
.
"
<EOS>
"
Burns
,
I
insist
on
your
hold
your
head
up
;
I
will
not
have
you
before
me
in
that
attitude
,
"
&
c.
&
c.
  
<EOS>
a
chapter
have
be
read
through
twice
,
the
book
be
close
and
the
girl
examine
.
<EOS>
the
lesson
have
comprise
part
of
the
reign
of
Charles
I.
,
and
there
be
sundry
question
about
tonnage
and
poundage
and
ship-
money
,
which
most
of
them
appear
unable
to
answer
;
still
,
every
little
difficulty
be
solve
instantly
when
it
reach
Burns
:
her
memory
seem
to
have
retain
the
substance
of
the
whole
lesson
,
and
she
be
ready
with
answer
on
every
point
.
<EOS>
I
keep
expect
that
Miss
Scatcherd
would
praise
her
attention
;
but
,
instead
of
that
,
she
suddenly
cry
out
    
"
You
dirty
,
disagreeable
girl
!
<EOS>
you
have
never
clean
your
nail
this
morning
!
"
  
<EOS>
Burns
make
no
answer
:
I
wonder
at
her
silence
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
think
I
,
"
do
she
not
explain
that
she
could
neither
clean
her
nail
nor
wash
her
face
,
as
the
water
be
freeze
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
attention
be
now
call
off
by
Miss
Smith
desire
me
to
hold
a
skein
of
thread
:
while
she
be
wind
it
,
she
talk
to
me
from
time
to
time
,
ask
whether
I
have
ever
be
at
school
before
,
whether
I
could
mark
,
stitch
,
knit
,
&
c.
;
till
she
dismiss
me
,
I
could
not
pursue
my
observation
on
Miss
Scatcherd
's
movement
.
<EOS>
when
I
return
to
my
seat
,
that
lady
be
just
deliver
an
order
of
which
I
do
not
catch
the
import
;
but
Burns
immediately
leave
the
class
,
and
go
into
the
small
inner
room
where
the
book
be
keep
,
return
in
half
a
minute
,
carry
in
her
hand
a
bundle
of
twig
tie
together
at
one
end
.
<EOS>
this
ominous
tool
she
present
to
Miss
Scatcherd
with
a
respectful
curtesy
;
then
she
quietly
,
and
without
be
tell
,
unloose
her
pinafore
,
and
the
teacher
instantly
and
sharply
inflict
on
her
neck
a
dozen
stroke
with
the
bunch
of
twig
.
<EOS>
not
a
tear
rise
to
Burns
'
eye
;
and
,
while
I
pause
from
my
sewing
,
because
my
finger
quiver
at
this
spectacle
with
a
sentiment
of
unavailing
and
impotent
anger
,
not
a
feature
of
her
pensive
face
alter
its
ordinary
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
hardened
girl
!
"
exclaim
Miss
Scatcherd
;
"
nothing
can
correct
you
of
your
slatternly
habit
:
carry
the
rod
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Burns
obey
:
I
look
at
her
narrowly
as
she
emerge
from
the
book
-
closet
;
she
be
just
put
back
her
handkerchief
into
her
pocket
,
and
the
trace
of
a
tear
glisten
on
her
thin
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
the
play
-
hour
in
the
evening
I
think
the
pleasantest
fraction
of
the
day
at
Lowood
:
the
bit
of
bread
,
the
draught
of
coffee
swallow
at
five
o'clock
have
revive
vitality
,
if
it
have
not
satisfy
hunger
:
the
long
restraint
of
the
day
be
slacken
;
the
schoolroom
feel
warm
than
in
the
morning
 
its
fire
be
allow
to
burn
a
little
more
brightly
,
to
supply
,
in
some
measure
,
the
place
of
candle
,
not
yet
introduce
:
the
ruddy
gloaming
,
the
licensed
uproar
,
the
confusion
of
many
voice
give
one
a
welcome
sense
of
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
I
have
see
Miss
Scatcherd
flog
her
pupil
,
Burns
,
I
wander
as
usual
among
the
form
and
table
and
laugh
group
without
a
companion
,
yet
not
feel
lonely
:
when
I
pass
the
window
,
<EOS>
I
now
and
then
lift
a
blind
,
and
look
out
;
it
snow
fast
,
a
drift
be
already
form
against
the
low
pane
;
put
my
ear
close
to
the
window
,
I
could
distinguish
from
the
gleeful
tumult
within
,
the
disconsolate
moan
of
the
wind
outside
.
  
<EOS>
probably
,
if
I
have
lately
leave
a
good
home
and
kind
parent
,
this
would
have
be
the
hour
when
I
should
most
keenly
have
regret
the
separation
;
that
wind
would
then
have
sadden
my
heart
;
this
obscure
chaos
would
have
disturb
my
peace
!
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
derive
from
both
a
strange
excitement
,
and
reckless
and
feverish
,
I
wish
the
wind
to
howl
more
wildly
,
the
gloom
to
deepen
to
darkness
,
and
the
confusion
to
rise
to
clamour
.
  
<EOS>
jump
over
form
,
and
creep
under
table
,
I
make
my
way
to
one
of
the
fire
-
place
;
there
,
kneel
by
the
high
wire
fender
,
I
find
Burns
,
absorb
,
silent
,
<EOS>
abstract
from
all
round
her
by
the
companionship
of
a
book
,
which
she
read
by
the
dim
glare
of
the
ember
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
still
"
Rasselas
'
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
come
behind
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
have
just
finish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
in
five
minute
more
she
shut
it
up
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
this
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
think
I
,
"
I
can
perhaps
get
her
to
talk
.
<EOS>
"
I
sit
down
by
her
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
name
besides
Burns
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Helen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
come
a
long
way
from
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
a
place
farther
north
,
quite
on
the
border
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
ever
go
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
;
but
nobody
can
be
sure
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
wish
to
leave
Lowood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
why
should
I
?
<EOS>
I
be
send
to
Lowood
to
get
an
education
;
and
it
would
be
of
no
use
go
away
until
I
have
attain
that
object
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
that
teacher
,
Miss
Scatcherd
,
be
so
cruel
to
you
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
cruel
?
<EOS>
not
at
all
!
<EOS>
She
be
severe
:
she
dislike
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
I
be
in
your
place
I
should
dislike
her
;
I
should
resist
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
strike
me
with
that
rod
,
I
should
get
it
from
her
hand
;
I
should
break
it
under
her
nose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
probably
you
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
:
but
if
you
do
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
would
expel
you
from
the
school
;
that
would
be
a
great
grief
to
your
relation
.
<EOS>
It
be
far
well

endure
patiently
a
smart
which
nobody

yourself

to
commit
a
hasty
action
whose
evil
consequence
will
extend
to
all
connect
with
you

and
besides
,
the
Bible
bid
us
return
good
for
evil

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
then
it
seem
disgraceful
to
be
flog
,
and
to
be
send
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
room
full
of
people
;
and
you
be
such
a
great
girl
:
<EOS>
I
be
far
young
than
you
,
and
I
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
it
would
be
your
duty
to
bear
it
,
if
you
could
not
avoid
it
:
it
be
weak
and
silly
to
say
you
_
can
not

_
<EOS>
what
it
be
your
fate
to
be
require
to
bear

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hear
her
with
wonder
:
I
could
not
comprehend
this
doctrine
of
endurance
;
and
still
less
could
I
understand
or
sympathise
with
the
forbearance
she
express
for
her
chastiser
.
<EOS>
still
I
feel
that
Helen
Burns
consider
thing
by
a
light
invisible
to
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
she
may
be
right
<EOS>
and
I
wrong
;
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
ponder
the
matter
deeply
;
like
Felix
,
I
put
it
off
to
a
more
convenient
season
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
you
have
fault
,
Helen
:
what
be
they
?
<EOS>
to
me
you
seem
very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
learn
from
me
,
not
to
judge
by
appearance
:
I
be
,
as
Miss
Scatcherd
say
,
slatternly
;
I
seldom
put
,
and
never
keep
,
thing
,
in
order
;
I
be
careless
<EOS>
;
I
forget
rule
;
I
read
when
I
should
learn
my
lesson
;
I
have
no
method
;
and
sometimes
I
say
,
like
you
,
I
can
not
_
bear
_
to
be
subject
to
systematic
arrangement
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
provoking
to
Miss
Scatcherd
,
who
be
naturally
neat
,
punctual
,
and
particular
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
cross
and
cruel
,
"
I
add
;
but
Helen
Burns
would
not
admit
my
addition
:
she
keep
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Miss
Temple
as
severe
to
you
as
Miss
Scatcherd

"
  
<EOS>
at
the
utterance
of
Miss
Temple
's
name
,
a
soft
smile
flit
over
her
grave
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Temple
be
full
of
goodness
;
it
pain
her
to
be
severe
to
any
one
,
even
the
bad
in
the
school
:
she
see
my
error
,
and
tell
me
of
them
gently
;
and
,
if
I
do
anything
worthy
of
praise
,
she
give
me
my
meed
liberally
.
<EOS>
one
strong
proof
of
my
wretchedly
defective
nature
be
,
that
even
her
expostulation
,
so
mild
,
so
rational
,
have
not
influence
to
cure
me
of
my
fault
;
and
even
her
praise
,
though
I
value
it
most
highly
,
can
not
stimulate
me
to
continue
care
and
foresight

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
curious
,
"

I

so
easy

be
careful

"
<EOS>
for
_
you
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
observe
you
in
your
class
this
morning
,
and
see
you
be
closely
attentive
:
your
thought
never
seem
to
wander
while
Miss
Miller
explain
the
lesson
and
question
you
.
<EOS>
now
,
mine
continually
rove
away
;
when
I
should
be
listen
to
Miss
Scatcherd
,
and
collect
all
she
say
with
assiduity
,
often
I
lose
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
;
I
fall
into
a
sort
of
dream
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
I
be
in
Northumberland
,
and
that
the
noise
I
hear
round
me
be
the
bubbling
of
a
little
brook
which
run
through
Deepden
,
near
our
house
;
 
then
,
<EOS>
when
it
come
to
my
turn
to
reply
,
I
have
to
be
awaken
;
and
have
hear
nothing
of
what
be
read
for
listen
to
the
visionary
brook
,
I
have
no
answer
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
how
well
you
reply
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
mere
chance
;
the
subject
on
which
we
have
be
read
have
interest
me
.
<EOS>
this
afternoon
,
instead
of
dream
of
Deepden
,
I
be
wonder
how
a
man
who
wish
to
do
right
could
act
so
unjustly
and
unwisely
as
Charles
the
First
sometimes
do
;
and
I
think
what
a
pity
it
be
that
,
with
his
integrity
and
conscientiousness
,
he
could
see
no
farther
than
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
but
be
able
to
look
to
a
distance
,
and
see
how
what
they
call
the
spirit
of
the
age
be
tend
!
<EOS>
still
,
I
like
Charles
 
<EOS>
I
respect
him
 
<EOS>
I
pity
him
,
poor
murder
king
!
<EOS>
yes
,
his
enemy
be
the
bad
:
they
shed
blood
they
have
no
right
to
shed
.
<EOS>
how
dare
they
kill
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Helen
be
talk
to
herself
now
<EOS>
:
she
have
forget
<EOS>
I
could
not
very
well
understand
her
 
that
I
be
ignorant
,
or
nearly
so
,
of
the
subject
she
discuss
.
<EOS>
I
recall
her
to
my
level
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
when
Miss
Temple
teach
you
,
do
your
thought
wander
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
certainly
,
not
often
;
because
Miss
Temple
have
generally
something
to
say
which
be
new
than
my
own
reflection
;
her
language
be
singularly
agreeable
to
me
,
and
the
information
she
communicate
be
often
just
what
I
wish
to
gain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
with
Miss
Temple
you
be
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
in
a
passive
way
:
I
make
no
effort
;
I
follow
as
inclination
guide
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
merit
in
such
goodness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
great
deal
:
you
be
good
to
those
who
be
good
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
I
ever
desire
to
be
.
<EOS>
if
people
be
always
kind
and
obedient
to
those
who
be
cruel
and
unjust
,
the
wicked
people
would
have
it
all
their
own
way
:
they
would
never
feel
afraid
,
and
so
they
would
never
alter
,
but
would
grow
bad
and
bad
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
strike
at
without
a
reason
,
we
should
strike
back
again
very
hard
;
I
be
sure
we
should
 
so
hard
as
to
teach
the
person
who
strike
us
never
to
do
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
change
your
mind
,
I
hope
,
when
you
grow
old
:
<EOS>
as
yet
you
be
but
a
little
untaught
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
feel
this
,
Helen
;
I
must
dislike
those
who
,
whatever
I
do
to
please
them
,
persist
in
dislike
me
;
I
must
resist
those
who
punish
me
unjustly
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
natural
as
that
I
should
love
those
who
show
me
affection
,
or
submit
to
punishment
when
I
feel
it
be
deserved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
heathen
and
savage

hold
that
doctrine

but
Christians

disown
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
?
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
violence
that
good
overcome
hate
 
nor
vengeance
that
most
certainly
heal
injury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
then
?
"
  
"
read
the
New
Testament
,
and
observe
what
Christ
say
,
and
how
He
act
;
make
His
word
your
rule
,
and
His
conduct
your
example

<EOS>
"
what
do

<EOS>
"
  
"

good
to
them

you

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
should
love
Mrs.
Reed
,
which
I
can
not
do
;
I
should
bless
her
son
John
,
which
be
impossible

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
her
turn
,
Helen
Burns
ask
me
to
explain
,
and
I
proceed
forthwith
to
pour
out
,
in
my
own
way
,
the
tale
of
my
suffering
and
resentment
.
<EOS>
bitter
and
truculent
when
excited

I
speak

I

without
reserve

Helen
hear
me
patiently
to
the
end

I
expect
she
would
then
make
a
remark
,
but
she
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
ask
impatiently
,
"
be
not
Mrs.
Reed
a
hard
-
hearted
,
bad
woman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
unkind
to
you
,
no
doubt
;
because
you
see
,
she
dislike
your
cast
of
character
,
as
Miss
Scatcherd
do
mine
;
but
how
minutely
you
remember
all
she
have
do
and
say
to
you
!
<EOS>
what
a
singularly
deep
impression
her
injustice
seem
to
have
make
on
your
heart
!
<EOS>
no
ill
-
usage
so
brand
its
record
on
my
feeling

<EOS>
Would
you
not
be
happy
if
you
try
to
forget
her
severity
,
together
with
the
passionate
emotion
it
excite
?
<EOS>
life
appear
to
me
too
short
to
be
spend
in
nursing
animosity
or
register
wrong
.
<EOS>
We
be
,
and
must
be
,
one
and
all
,
burden
with
fault
in
this
world
:
but
the
time
will
soon
come
when
,
I
trust
,
we
shall
put
them
off
in
put
off
our
corruptible
body
;
when
debasement
and
sin
will
fall
from
us
with
this
cumbrous
frame
of
flesh
,
and
only
the
spark
of
the
spirit
will
remain
,
 
the
impalpable
principle
of
light
and
think
,
pure
as
when
it
leave
the
Creator
to
inspire
the
creature
:
whence
it
come
it
will
return
;
perhaps
again
to
be
communicate
to
some
be
high
than
man
 
perhaps
to
pass
through
gradation
of
glory
,
from
the
pale
human
soul
to
brighten
to
the
seraph
!
<EOS>
surely
it
will
never
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
suffer
to
degenerate
from
man
to
fiend
?
<EOS>
no
;
I
can
not
believe
that
:
I
hold
another
creed
:
which
no
one
ever
teach
me
,
and
which
I
seldom
mention
;
but
in
which
I
delight
,
and
to
which
I
cling
:
<EOS>
for
it
extend
hope
to
all
:
it
make
eternity
a
rest
 
<EOS>
a
mighty
home
,
not
a
terror
and
an
abyss
.
<EOS>
besides
,
with
this
creed
,
I
can
so
clearly
distinguish
between
the
criminal
and
his
crime
;
I
can
so
sincerely
forgive
the
first
while
I
abhor
the
last
:
with
this
creed
revenge
never
worry
my
heart
,
degradation
never
too
deeply
disgust
me
,
injustice
never
crush
me
too
low
:
I
live
in
calm
,
look
to
the
end
.

<EOS>
Helen

head

always
droop
,
sink
a
little
low
as
she
finish
this
sentence

<EOS>
I
see
by
her
look
<EOS>
she
wish
no
longer
to
talk
to
me
,
but
rather
to
converse
with
her
own
thought

She
be
not
allow
much
time

meditation

a
monitor

a
great
rough
girl

presently
come
up

exclaim
in
a
strong
Cumberland
accent

your
drawer
in
order

up
your
work

minute

will
tell
Miss

come

<EOS>
Helen
sigh
as
her
reverie
flee

and
get
up

obey
the
monitor
without
reply
as
without
delay

<EOS>
My
first
quarter
at
Lowood
seem
an
age
;
and
not
the
golden
age
either
;
it
comprise
an
irksome
struggle
with
difficulty
in
habituating
myself
to
new
rule
and
unwonted
task
.
<EOS>
the
fear
of
failure
in
these
point
harass
me
bad
than
the
physical
hardship
of
my
lot
;
though
these
be
no
trifle
.
  
<EOS>
during
January
,
February
,
and
part
of
March
,
the
deep
snow
,
and
,
after
their
melting
,
the
almost
impassable
road
,
prevent
our
stir
beyond
the
garden
wall
,
except
to
go
to
church
;
but
within
these
limit
we
have
to
pass
an
hour
every
day
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
Our
clothing
be
insufficient
to
protect
us
from
the
severe
cold
:
we
have
no
boot
,
the
snow
get
into
our
shoe
and
melt
there
:
<EOS>
our
ungloved
hand
become
numb
and
cover
with
chilblain
,
as
be
our
foot
:
I
remember
well
the
distracting
irritation
I
endure
from
this
cause
<EOS>
every
evening
,
when
my
foot
inflame
;
and
the
torture
of
thrust
the
swelled
,
raw
,
and
stiff
toe
into
my
shoe
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
then
the
scanty
supply
of
food
be
distress
:
with
the
keen
appetite
of
grow
child
,
we
have
scarcely
sufficient
to
keep
alive
a
delicate
invalid
.
<EOS>
from
this
deficiency
of
nourishment
result
an
abuse
,
which
press
hardly
on
the
young
pupil
:
whenever
the
famish
great
girl
have
an
opportunity
,
they
would
coax
or
menace
the
little
one
out
of
their
portion
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
I
have
share
between
two
claimant
the
precious
morsel
of
brown
bread
distribute
at
tea
-
time
;
and
after
relinquish
to
a
third
half
the
content
of
my
mug
of
coffee
,
I
have
swallow
the
remainder
with
an
accompaniment
of
secret
tear
,
force
from
me
by
the
exigency
of
hunger
.
  
<EOS>
sunday
be
dreary
day
in
that
wintry
season

<EOS>
We
have
to
walk
two
mile
to
Brocklebridge
Church
,
where
our
patron
officiate
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
cold
,
we
arrive
at
church
colder
:
during
the
morning
service
we
become
almost
paralysed
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
far
to
return
to
dinner
,
and
an
allowance
of
cold
meat
and
bread
,
in
the
same
penurious
proportion
observe
in
our
ordinary
meal
,
be
serve
round
between
the
service

<EOS>
at
the
close
of
the
afternoon
service
we
return
by
an
expose
and
hilly
road
,
where
the
bitter
winter
wind
,
blow
over
a
range
of
snowy
summit
to
the
north
,
almost
flay
the
skin
from
our

I
can
remember
Miss

walk
lightly

rapidly
along
our
drooping
line
,
her
plaid
cloak
,
which
the
frosty
wind
flutter
,
gather
close
about
her

and
encourage
us
,
by
precept
and
example
,
to
keep
up
our
spirit
,
and
march
forward
,
as
she
say
,
"
like
stalwart
soldier

poor

fire

back

to
the
little
one
at

this

deny

each

and
behind
them
the
young
child
crouch
in
group
,
wrap
their
starve
arm
in
their
pinafore
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
solace
come
at
tea
-
time
,
in
the
shape
of
a
double
ration
of
bread
 
<EOS>
a
whole
,
instead
of
a
half
,
slice
 
with
the
delicious
addition
of
a
thin
scrape
of
butter
<EOS>
:
it
be
the
hebdomadal
treat
to
which
we
all
look
forward
from
Sabbath
to
Sabbath
.
<EOS>
I
generally
contrive
to
reserve
a
moiety
of
this
bounteous
repast
for
myself
;
but
the
remainder
I
be
invariably
oblige
to
part
with
.
  
<EOS>
the
Sunday
evening
be
spend
in
repeat
,
by
heart
,
the
Church
Catechism
,
and
the
fifth
,
sixth
,
and
seventh
chapter
of
St.
Matthew
;
and
in
listen
to
a
long
sermon
,
read
by
Miss
Miller
,
whose
irrepressible
yawn
attest
her
weariness
.
<EOS>
a
frequent
interlude
of
these
performance
be
the
enactment
of
the
part
of
Eutychus
by
some
half
-
dozen
of
little
girl
,
who
,
overpower
with
sleep
,
would
fall
down
,
if
not
out
of
the
third
loft
,
yet
off
the
fourth
form
,
and
be
take
up
half
dead
.
<EOS>
the
remedy
be
,
to
thrust
them
forward
into
the
centre
of
the
schoolroom
,
and
oblige
them
to
stand
there
till
the
sermon
be
finish
.
<EOS>
sometimes
their
foot
fail
them
,
and
they
sink
together
in
a
heap
;
they
be
then
prop
up
with
the
monitor
'
high
stool
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
allude
to
the
visit
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
and
indeed
that
gentleman
be
from
home
during
the
great
part
of
the
first
month
after
my
arrival
;
perhaps
prolong
his
stay
with
his
friend
the
archdeacon
:
his
absence
be
a
relief
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
that
I
have
my
own
reason
for
dread
his
coming
:
but
come
he
do
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
one
afternoon
(
I
have
then
be
three
week
at
Lowood
)
,
as
I
be
sit
with
a
slate
in
my
hand
,
puzzle
over
a
sum
in
long
division
,
my
eye
,
raise
in
abstraction
to
the
window
,
catch
sight
of
a
figure
just
pass
:
<EOS>
I
recognise
almost
instinctively
that
gaunt
outline
;
and
when
,
two
minute
after
,
all
the
school
,
teacher
include
,
rise
_
en
<EOS>
masse
_
<EOS>
,
it
be
not
necessary
for
me
to
look
up
in
order
to
ascertain
whose
entrance
they
thus
greet
.
<EOS>
a
long
stride
measure
the
schoolroom
,
and
presently
beside
Miss
Temple
,
who
herself
have
rise
,
stand
the
same
black
column
which
have
frown
on
me
so
ominously
from
the
hearthrug
of
Gateshead
.
<EOS>
I
now
glance
sideways
at
this
piece
of
architecture
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
right
:
it
be
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
button
up
in
a
surtout
,
and
look
longer
,
narrow
,
and
more
rigid
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
my
own
reason
for
be
dismay
at
this
apparition
;
too
well
I
remember
the
perfidious
hint
give
by
Mrs.
Reed
about
my
disposition
,
&
c.
;
the
promise
pledge
by
Mr.
Brocklehurst
to
apprise
Miss
Temple
and
the
teacher
of
my
vicious
nature
.
<EOS>
all
along
I
have
be
dread
the
fulfilment
of
this
promise
,
 
I
have
be
look
out
daily
for
the
"
come
man
,
"
whose
information
respect
my
past
life
and
conversation
be
to
brand
me
as
a
bad
child
for
ever
:
now
there
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
stand
at
Miss
Temple
's
side
;
he
be
speak
low
in
her
ear
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
he
be
make
disclosure
of
my
villainy
;
and
I
watch
her
eye
with
painful
anxiety
,
expect
every
moment
to
see
its
dark
orb
turn
on
me
a
glance
of
repugnance
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
listen
too
;
and
as
I
happen
to
be
seat
quite
at
the
top
of
the
room
,
I
catch
most
of
what
he
say
:
its
import
relieve
me
from
immediate
apprehension
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
Miss
Temple
,
the
thread
I
buy
at
Lowton
will
do
;
it
strike
me
that
it
would
be
just
of
the
quality
for
the
calico
chemise
,
and
I
sort
the
needle
to
match
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
Miss
Smith
that
I
forgot
to
make
a
memorandum
of
the
darn
needle
,
but
she
shall
have
some
paper
send
in
next
week
;
and
she
be
not
,
on
any
account
,
to
give
out
more
than
one
at
a
time
to
each
pupil
:
if
they
have
more
,
they
be
apt
to
be
careless
and
lose
them
.
<EOS>
and
,
o
madam
!
<EOS>
I
wish
the
woollen
stocking
be
better
look
to
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
here
last
,
I
go
into
the
kitchen
-
garden
and
examine
the
clothe
dry
on
the
line
;
there
be
a
quantity
of
black
hose
in
a
very
bad
state
of
repair
:
from
the
size
of
the
hole
in
them
<EOS>
I
be
sure
they
have
not
be
well
mend
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
direction
shall
be
attend
to
,
sir
,
"
say
Miss
Temple
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
madam
,
"
he
continue
,
"
the
laundress
tell
me
some
of
the
girl
have
two
clean
tucker
in
the
week
:
it
be
too
much
;
the
rule
limit
them
to
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
explain
that
circumstance
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Agnes
and
Catherine
Johnstone
be
invite
to
take
tea
with
some
friend
at
Lowton
last
Thursday
,
and
I
give
them
leave
to
put
on
clean
tucker
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
nod
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
for
once
it
may
pass
;
but
please
not
to
let
the
circumstance
occur
too
often
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
another
thing
which
surprise
me
;
I
find
,
in
settle
account
with
the
housekeeper
,
that
a
lunch
,
consist
of
bread
and
cheese
,
have
twice
be
serve
out
to
the
girl
during
the
past
fortnight
.
<EOS>
how
be
this
?
<EOS>
I
look
over
the
regulation
,
and
I
find
no
such
meal
as
lunch
mention
.
<EOS>
who
introduce
this
innovation
?
<EOS>
and
by
what
authority
?
"
  
"
I
must
be
responsible
for
the
circumstance
,
sir
,
"
reply
Miss
Temple
:
<EOS>
"
the
breakfast
be
so
ill
prepared
that
the
pupil
could
not
possibly
eat
it
;
and
I
dare
not
allow
them
to
remain
fast
till
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
allow
me
an
instant
.
<EOS>
You
be
aware
that
my
plan
in
bring
up
these
girl
be
,
not
to
accustom
them
to
habit
of
luxury
and
indulgence
,
but
to
render
them
hardy
,
patient
,
self
-
deny
.
<EOS>
Should
any
little
accidental
disappointment
of
the
appetite
occur
,
such
as
the
spoiling
of
a
meal
,
the
under
or
the
over
dressing
of
a
dish
,
the
incident
ought
not
to
be
neutralise
by
replace
with
something
more
delicate
the
comfort
lose
,
thus
pamper
the
body
and
obviate
the
aim
of
this
institution
;
it
ought
to
be
improve
to
the
spiritual
edification
of
the
pupil
,
by
encourage
them
to
evince
fortitude
under
temporary
privation
.
<EOS>
a
brief
address
on
those
occasion
would
not
be
mistime
,
wherein
a
judicious
instructor
would
take
the
opportunity
of
refer
to
the
suffering
of
the
primitive
Christians
;
to
the
torment
of
martyr
;
to
the
exhortation
of
our
bless
Lord
Himself
,
call
upon
His
disciple
to
take
up
their
cross
and
follow
Him
;
to
His
warning
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
,
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
God
;
to
His
divine
consolation
,
"
if
ye
suffer
hunger
or
thirst
for
My
sake
,
happy
be
ye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
madam
,
when
you
put
bread
and
cheese
,
instead
of
burn
porridge
,
into
these
child
's
mouth
,
you
may
indeed
feed
their
vile
body
,
but
you
little
think
how
you
starve
their
immortal
soul
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
again
pause
 
perhaps
overcome
by
his
feeling
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
have
look
down
when
he
first
begin
to
speak
to
her
;
but
she
now
gaze
straight
before
her
,
and
her
face
,
naturally
pale
as
marble
,
appear
to
be
assume
also
the
coldness
and
fixity
of
that
material
;
especially
her
mouth
,
close
as
if
it
would
have
require
a
sculptor
's
chisel
to
open
it
,
and
her
brow
settle
gradually
into
petrified
severity
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
stand
on
the
hearth
with
his
hand
behind
his
back
,
majestically
survey
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
suddenly
his
eye
give
a
blink
,
as
if
it
have
meet
something
that
either
dazzle
or
shock
its
pupil
;
turning
<EOS>
,
he
say
in
more
rapid
accent
than
he
have
hitherto
use
    
"
Miss
Temple
,
Miss
Temple
,
what
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
_
be
that
girl
with
curled
hair
?
<EOS>
red
hair
,
madam
,
curl
 
curl
all
over
?
"
<EOS>
and
extend
his
cane
he
point
to
the
awful
object
,
his
hand
shake
as
he
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
Julia
Severn
,
"
reply
Miss
Temple
,
very
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Julia
Severn
,
madam
!
<EOS>
and
why
have
she
,
or
any
other
,
curled
hair
?
<EOS>
why
,
in
defiance
of
every
precept
and
principle
of
this
house
,
do
she
conform
to
the
world
so
openly
 
here
in
an
evangelical
,
charitable
establishment
 
as
to
wear
her
hair
one
mass
of
curl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Julia
's
hair
curl
naturally
,
"
return
Miss
Temple
,
still
more
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
naturally
!
<EOS>
yes
,
but
we
be
not
to
conform
to
nature
;
I
wish
these
girl
to
be
the
child
of
grace
:
and
why
that
abundance
?
<EOS>
I
have
again
and
again
intimate
that
I
desire
the
hair
to
be
arrange
closely
,
modestly
,
plainly
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
,
that
girl
's
hair
must
be
cut
off
entirely
;
I
will
send
a
barber
to
-
morrow
:
and
I
see
other
who
have
far
too
much
of
the
excrescence
 
<EOS>
that
tall
girl
,
tell
her
to
turn
round
.
<EOS>
tell
all
the
first
form
to
rise
up
and
direct
their
face
to
the
wall
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
pass
her
handkerchief
over
her
lip
,
as
if
to
smooth
away
the
involuntary
smile
that
curl
them
;
she
give
the
order
,
however
,
and
when
the
first
class
could
take
in
what
be
require
of
them
,
they
obey
.
<EOS>
lean
a
little
back
on
my
bench
,
I
could
see
the
look
and
grimace
with
which
they
comment
on
this
manoeuvre
:
it
be
a
pity
Mr.
Brocklehurst
could
not
see
them
too
;
he
would
perhaps
have
feel
that
,
whatever
he
may
do
with
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
,
the
inside
be
further
beyond
his
interference
than
he
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
He
scrutinise
the
reverse
of
these
living
medal
some
five
minute
,
then
pronounce
sentence
.
<EOS>
these
word
fall
like
the
knell
of
doom
    
"
all
those
top

knot
must
be
cut
off

<EOS>
Miss

seem
to
remonstrate

"
Madam

he
pursue
,
"
I
have
a
Master

my

to
mortify

the
lust
of

to
teach
them
to
clothe
themselves
with
shame

facedness
and
sobriety

not
with

apparel

Mr.
Brocklehurst
be
here
interrupt
:
three
other
visitor
,
lady
,
now
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
have
come
a
little
sooner
to
have
hear
his
lecture
on
dress
,
for
they
be
splendidly
attire
in
velvet
,
silk
,
and
fur
.
<EOS>
the
two
young
of
the
trio
(
fine
girl
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
)
have
grey
beaver
hat
,
then
in
fashion
,
shade
with
ostrich
plume
,
and
from
under
the
brim
of
this
graceful
head

dress
fall
a
profusion
of
light
tress
,
elaborately
curl
;
the
eld
lady
be
envelop
in
a
costly
velvet
shawl
,
trim
with
ermine
,
and
she
wear
a
false
front
of
french
curl
.
  
<EOS>
these
lady
be
deferentially
receive
by
Miss
Temple
,
as
Mrs.
and
the
Misses
Brocklehurst
,
and
conduct
to
seat
of
honour
at
the
top
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
seem
they
have
come
in
the
carriage
with
their
reverend
relative
,
and
have
be
conduct
a
rummage
scrutiny
of
the
room
upstairs
,
while
he
transact
business
with
the
housekeeper
,
question
the
laundress
,
and
lecture
the
superintendent

They
now
proceed
to
address
diver
remark
and
reproofs
to
Miss
Smith
,
who
be
charge
with
the
care
of
the
linen
and
the
inspection
of
the
dormitory
:
but
I
have
no
time
to
listen
to
what
they
say
;
other
matter
call
off
and
enchant
my
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
while
gather
up
the
discourse
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
and
Miss
Temple
,
I
have
not
,
at
the
same
time
,
neglect
precaution
to
secure
my
personal
safety
;
which
I
think
would
be
effect
,
if
I
could
only
elude
observation
.
<EOS>
to
this
end
,
I
have
sit
well
back
on
the
form
,
and
while
seem
to
be
busy
with
my
sum
,
have
hold
my
slate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
conceal
my
face
:
I
may
have
escape
notice
,
have
not
my
treacherous
slate
somehow
happen
to
slip
from
my
hand
,
and
fall
with
an
obtrusive
crash
,
directly
draw
every
eye
upon
me
;
I
know
it
be
all
over
now
,
and
,
as
I
stoop
to
pick
up
the
two
fragment
of
slate
,
I
rally
my
force
for
the
bad
.
<EOS>
It
come

<EOS>
"
a
careless

say
Mr.
Brocklehurst

and
immediately
after
 
"
It
be
the
new
pupil

I
perceive
.

<EOS>
and
before
I
could
draw
breath
,
"
I
must
not
forget
I
have
a
word
to
say
respect
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
aloud
:
how
loud
it
seem
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
let
the
child
who
break
her
slate
come
forward
!
"
  
<EOS>
of
my
own
accord
I
could
not
have
stir
;
I
be
paralysed
:
but
the
two
great
girl
who
sit
on
each
side
of
me
,
set
me
on
my
leg
and
push
me
towards
the
dread
judge
,
and
then
Miss
Temple
gently
assist
me
to
his
very
foot
,
and
I
catch
her
whisper
counsel
    
"
do
not
be
afraid
,
<EOS>
Jane
,
I
see
it
be
an
accident
;
you
shall
not
be
punish

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
kind
whisper
go
to
my
heart
like
a
dagger
.
  
<EOS>
"
another
minute
,
and
she
will
despise
me
for
a
hypocrite
,
"
think
I
;
and
an
impulse
of
fury
against
Reed
,
Brocklehurst
,
and
Co.
bound
in
my
pulse
at
the
conviction
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
Helen
Burns
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fetch
that
stool
,
"
say
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
point
to
a
very
high
one
from
which
a
monitor
have
just

<EOS>
"
place
the
child
upon
it

<EOS>
and
I
be
place
there
,
<EOS>
by
whom
I
do
not
know
:
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
condition
to
note
particular
;
I
be
only
aware
that
they
have
hoist
me
up
to
the
height
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
's
nose
,
that
he
be
within
a
yard
of
me
,
and
that
a
spread
of
shot
orange
and
purple
silk
pelisse
and
a
cloud
of
silvery
plumage
extend
and
wave
below
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
"
Ladies

to
his

Miss

,
you
all

this

<EOS>
of
course
they
do
;
for
I
feel
their
eye
direct
like
burn
-
glass
against
my
scorched
skin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
she
be
yet
young
;
you
observe
she
possess
the
ordinary
form
of
childhood
;
God
have
graciously
give
her
the
shape
that
He
have
give
to
all
of
us
;
no
signal
deformity
point
her
out
as
a
mark

<EOS>
who
would
think
that
the
Evil
One
have
already
find
a
servant
and
agent
in
her
?
<EOS>
yet
such
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
be
the
case
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
pause
 
in
which
I
begin
to
steady
the
palsy
of
my
nerve
,
and
to
feel
that
the
Rubicon
be
pass
;
and
that
the
trial
,
no
longer
to
be
shirk
,
must
be
firmly
sustain

<EOS>
"
My
dear
child

pursue
the
black
marble
clergyman

with
pathos
,
"
this
be
a
sad
,
a
melancholy
occasion
;
for
it
become
my
duty
to
warn
you
,
that
this
girl
,
who
may
be
one
of
God
's
own
lamb
,
be
a
little
castaway
:
not
a
member
of
the
true
flock
,
but
evidently
an
interloper
and
an
alien
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
on
your
guard
against
her
;
you
must
shun
her
example
;
if
necessary
,
avoid
her
company
,
exclude
her
from
your
sport
,
and
shut
her
out
from
your
converse

<EOS>
teacher
,
you
must
watch
her
:
keep
your
eye
on
her
movement
,
weigh
well
her
word
,
scrutinise
her
action
,
punish
her
body
to
save
her
soul
:
<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
such
salvation
be
possible
,
for
(
my
tongue
falter
while
I
tell
it
)
<EOS>
this
girl
,
this
child
,
the
native
of
a
christian
land
,
bad
than
many
a
little
heathen
who
say
its
prayer
to
Brahma
and
kneel
before
Juggernaut
 
<EOS>
this
girl
be
 
a
liar
!
"
  
<EOS>
now
come
a
pause
of
ten
minute
,
during
which
I
,
by
this
time
in
perfect
possession
of
my
wit
,
observe
all
the
female
brocklehurst
produce
their
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
apply
them
to
their
optic
,
while
the
elderly
lady
sway
herself
to
and
fro
,
and
the
two
young
one
whisper
,
"
how
shocking
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
resume
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
I
learn
from
her
benefactress
;
from
the
pious
and
charitable
lady
who
adopt
her
in
her
orphan
state
,
rear
her
as
her
own
daughter
,
and
whose
kindness
,
whose
generosity
the
unhappy
girl
repay
by
an
ingratitude
so
bad
,
so
dreadful
,
that
at
last
her
excellent
patroness
be
oblige
to
separate
her
from
her
own
young
one
,
fearful
lest
her
vicious
example
should
contaminate
their
purity
:
she
have
send
her
here
to
be
heal
,
even
as
the
Jews
of
old
send
their
disease
to
the
troubled
pool
of
Bethesda
;
and
,
teacher
,
superintendent
<EOS>
,
I
beg
of
you
not
to
allow
the
water
to
stagnate
round
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
sublime
conclusion
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
adjust
the
top
button
of
his
surtout
,
mutter
something
to
his
family
,
who
rise
,
bow
to
Miss
Temple
,
and
then
all
the
great
people
sail
in
state
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
turn
at
the
door
,
my
judge
say
    
"
let
her
stand
half
-
an
-
hour
longer
on
that
stool
,
and
let
no
one
speak
to
her
during
the
remainder
of
the
day

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
I
,
then
,
mount
aloft
;
I
,
who
have
say
I
could
not
bear
the
shame
of
stand
on
my
natural
foot
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
be
now
expose
to
general
view
on
a
pedestal
of
infamy
.
<EOS>
what
my
sensation
be
no
language
can
describe
;
but
just
as
they
all
rise
,
stifle
my
breath
and
constrict
my
throat
,
a
girl
come
up
and
pass
me
:
in
passing
,
she
lift
her
eye
.
<EOS>
what
a
strange
light
inspire
them
!
<EOS>
what
an
extraordinary
sensation
that
ray
send
through
me
!
<EOS>
how
the
new
feeling
bear
me
up
!
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
a
martyr
,
a
hero
,
have
pass
a
slave
or
victim
,
and
impart
strength
in
the
transit
.
<EOS>
I
master
the
rise
hysteria
,
lift
up
my
head
,
and
take
a
firm
stand
on
the
stool
.
<EOS>
Helen
Burns
ask
some
slight
question
about
her
work
of
Miss
Smith
,
be
chidden
for
the
triviality
of
the
inquiry
,
return
to
her
place
,
and
smile
at
me
as
she
again
go
by
.
<EOS>
what
a
smile
!
<EOS>
I
remember
it
now
,
and
I
know
that
it
be
the
effluence
of
fine
intellect
,
of
true
courage
;
it
light
up
her
mark
lineament
,
her
thin
face
,
her
sink
grey
eye
,
like
a
reflection
from
the
aspect
of
an
angel
.
<EOS>
yet
at
that
moment
Helen
Burns
wear
on
her
arm
"
the
untidy
badge
;
<EOS>
"
scarcely
an
hour
ago
I
have
hear
her
condemn
by
Miss
Scatcherd
to
a
dinner
of
bread
and
water
on
the
morrow
because
she
have
blot
an
exercise
in
copy
it
out
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
imperfect
nature
of
man
!
<EOS>
such
spot
be
there
on
the
disc
of
the
clear
planet
;
and
eye
like
Miss
Scatcherd
's
can
only
see
those
minute
defect
,
and
be
blind
to
the
full
brightness
of
the
orb
.
    
<EOS>
Ere
the
half
-
hour
end
,
five
o'clock
strike
;
school
be
dismiss
,
and
all
be
go
into
the
refectory
to
tea
.
<EOS>
I
now
venture
to
descend
:
it
be
deep
dusk
;
I
retire
into
a
corner
and
sit
down
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
the
spell
by
which
I
have
be
so
far
support
begin
to
dissolve
;
reaction
take
place
,
and
soon
,
so
overwhelming
be
the
grief
that
seize
me
<EOS>
,
I
sink
prostrate
with
my
face
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
now
I
weep
:
<EOS>
Helen
Burns
be
not
here
;
nothing
sustain
me
;
leave
to
myself
<EOS>
I
abandon
myself
,
and
my
tear
water
the
board
.
<EOS>
I
have
mean
to
be
so
good
,
and
to
do
so
much
at
lowood
:
to
make
so
many
friend
,
to
earn
respect
and
win
affection
.
<EOS>
already
I
have
make
visible
progress
:
that
very
morning
I
have
reach
the
head
of
my
class
;
Miss
Miller
have
praise
me
warmly
;
Miss
Temple
have
smile
approbation
;
she
have
promise
to
teach
me
draw
,
and
to
let
me
learn
French
,
if
I
continue
to
make
similar
improvement
two
month
longer
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
be
well
receive
by
my
fellow
-
pupil
;
treat
as
an
equal
by
those
of
my
own
age
,
and
not
molest
by
any
;
now
,
here
I
lay
again
crush
and
trodden
on
;
and
could
I
ever
rise
more
?
  
<EOS>
"
never
,
"
I
think
;
and
ardently
I
wish
to
die
.
<EOS>
while
sob
out
this
wish
in
broken
accent
,
some
one
approach
:
I
start
up
 
again
<EOS>
Helen
Burns
be
near
me
;
the
fade
fire
just
show
her
come
up
the
long
,
vacant
room
;
she
bring
my
coffee
and
bread
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
eat
something
,
"
she
say
;
but
I
put
both
away
from
me
,
feel
as
if
a
drop
or
a
crumb
would
have
choke
me
in
my
present
condition
.
<EOS>
Helen
regard
me
,
probably
with
surprise
:
I
could
not
now
abate
my
agitation
,
though
I
try
hard
;
I
continue
to
weep
aloud
.
<EOS>
She
sit
down
on
the
ground
near
me
,
embrace
her
knee
with
her
arm
,
and
rest
her
head
upon
them
;
in
that
attitude
she
remain
silent
as
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
first
who
speak
    
"
Helen
<EOS>
,
why
do
you
stay
with
a
girl
whom
everybody
believe
to
be
a
liar

"
  
<EOS>
"
everybody

Jane

there
be

eighty
people

hear
you
call
so

"
but
what
have
I
to
do
with
million
?
<EOS>
the
eighty

I
know
,
despise
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you
be
mistaken
:
probably
not
one
in
the
school
<EOS>
either
despise
or
dislike
you
:
<EOS>
many
,
I
be
sure
,
pity
you
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
they
pity
me
after
what
Mr.
Brocklehurst
have
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Brocklehurst
be
not
a
god
:
nor
be
he
even
a
great
and
admired
man
:
he
be
little
liked
here
;
he
never
take
step
to
make
himself
like

<EOS>
have
he
treat
you
as
an
especial
favourite

you
would
have
find
enemy

declare
or
covert

all
around
you

as
it
be

the
great
number
would
offer
you
sympathy
if
they
dare

<EOS>
teacher
and
pupil
may
look
coldly
on
you
for
a
day
or
two
,
but
friendly
feeling
be
conceal
in
their
heart
;
and
if
you
persevere
in
do
well
,
these
feeling
will
ere
long
appear
so
much
the
more
evidently
for
their
temporary
suppression

into

chafe
my

gently
to

them

go
on

you
wicked

no

I
know
I
should
think
well

that

can
not

solitary

here

to
gain
some
real
affection
from

truly

Hush
,
Jane

<EOS>
you
think
too
much
of
the
love
of
human
being

you
be
too
impulsive

too
vehement

the
sovereign
hand

create

into

have
provide
you
with

besides
this

<EOS>
I
be
silent
;
Helen
have
calm
me
;
but
in
the
tranquillity
she
impart
there
be
an
alloy
of
inexpressible
sadness

<EOS>
I
feel
the
impression
of
woe
as
she
speak

I
could
not

whence
it
come

when

have
do
speak

she
breathe
a

fast

cough
a
short
cough

I
momentarily

on

round

<EOS>
she
ask
,
look
down
at
my
face
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
cry
your
grief
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
never
shall
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
have
be
wrongly
accuse
;
and
you
,
madam
,
and
everybody
else
,
will
now
think
me
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
think
you
what
you
prove
yourself
to
be
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
continue
to
act
as
a
good
girl
,
and
you
will
satisfy
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
,
Miss
Temple
?
"
  
"
You
will
,
"
say
she
,
pass
her
arm
round
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
tell
me
who
be
the
lady
whom
Mr.
Brocklehurst
call
your
benefactress
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Reed
,
my
uncle
's
wife
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
dead
,
and
he
leave
me
to
her
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
not
,
then
,
adopt
you
of
her
own
accord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
;
she
be
sorry
to
have
to
do
it
:
but
my
uncle
,
as
I
have
often
hear
the
servant
say
,
get
her
to
promise
before
he
die
that
she
would
always
keep
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
now
,
Jane
,
you
know
,
or
at
least
I
will
tell
you
,
that
when
a
criminal
be
accuse
,
he
be
always
allow
to
speak
in
his
own
defence
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
charge
with
falsehood
;
defend
yourself
to
me
as
well
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
say
whatever
your
memory
suggest
be
true
;
but
add
nothing
and
exaggerate
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
resolve
,
in
the
depth
of
my
heart
,
that
I
would
be
most
moderate
 
most
correct
;
and
,
have
reflect
a
few
minute
in
order
to
arrange
coherently
what
I
have
to
say
,
I
tell
her
all
the
story
of
my
sad
childhood
.
<EOS>
exhaust
by
emotion
,
my
language
be
more
subdued
than
it
generally
be
when
it
develop
that
sad
theme
;
and
mindful
of
Helen
's
warning
against
the
indulgence
of
resentment
,
I
infuse
into
the
narrative
far
less
of
gall
and
wormwood
than
ordinary
.
<EOS>
thus
restrained
and
simplify
,
it
sound
more
credible
:
I
feel
as
I
go
on
that
Miss
Temple
fully
believe
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
tale
I
have
mention
Mr.
Lloyd
as
have
come
to
see
me
after
the
fit
:
for
I
never
forget
the
,
to
me
,
frightful
episode
of
the
red
-
room
:
<EOS>
in
detail
which
,
my
excitement
be
sure
,
in
some
degree
,
to
break
bound
;
for
nothing
could
soften
in
my
recollection
the
spasm
of
agony
which
clutch
my
heart
when
Mrs.
Reed
spurn
my
wild
supplication
for
pardon
,
and
lock
me
a
second
time
in
the
dark
and
haunted
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
finish
:
Miss
Temple
regard
me
a
few
minute
in
silence
;
she
then
say
    
"
I
know
something
of
Mr.
Lloyd
;
I
shall
write
to
him
;
if
his
reply
agree
with
your
statement

you

clear

to
me

Jane

you
be
clear
now

"
  
<EOS>
She
kiss
me
,
and
still
keep
me
at
her
side
(
where
I
be
well
contented
to
stand
,
for
I
derive
a
child
's
pleasure
from
the
contemplation
of
her
face
,
her
dress
,
her
one
or
two
ornament
,
her
white
forehead
,
her
clustered
and
shine
curl

she
proceed
to

Helen
Burns

<EOS>
"

It

a
little
well

<EOS>
Miss
Temple
get
up
,
take
her
hand
and
examine
her
pulse
;
then
she
return
to
her
own
seat
:
as
she
resume
it
,
I
hear
her
sigh
low
.
<EOS>
She
be
pensive
a
few
minute
,
then
rouse
herself
,
she
say
cheerfully
    
"

little
round
table
near
the
fire

<EOS>
how
fragrant
be
the
steam
of
the
beverage
,
and
the
scent
of
the
toast
!
<EOS>
of
which
,
however
,
I
,
to
my
dismay
(
for
I
be
begin
to
be
hungry
)
discern
only
a
very
small
portion
:
Miss
Temple
discern
it
too
.
  
<EOS>

Barbara
,
"
say
she
,
"
can
you
not
bring
a
little
more
bread

butter

there
be
not
enough

<EOS>

go
out

she
return
soon
    
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
Mrs.
Harden

she

send
up
the
usual
quantity

<EOS>
Mrs.
Harden

be
it
observe
,
be
the
housekeeper
:
a
woman
after
Mr.
Brocklehurst
's
own
heart
,
make
up
of
equal
part
of
whalebone
and
iron

<EOS>
"
oh

very
well

"
return
Miss
Temple
;
"
we
must
make
it
do
,
Barbara
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
and
as
the
girl
withdraw
she
add
,
smile
,
"
<EOS>
fortunately
,
I
have
it
in
my
power
to
supply
deficiency
for
this
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
invite
Helen
and
me
to
approach
the
table
,
and
place
before
each
of
us
a
cup
of
tea
with
one
delicious
but
thin
morsel
of
toast
,
she
get
up
,
unlock
a
drawer
,
and
take
from
it
a
parcel
wrap
in
paper
,
disclose
presently
to
our
eye
a
good
-
sized
seed
-
cake
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
give
each
of
you
some
of
this
to
take
with
you
,
"
say
she
,
"
but
as
there
be
so
little
toast
,
you
must
have
it
now
,
"
and
she
proceed
to
cut
slice
with
a
generous
hand
.
  
<EOS>
We
feast
that
evening
as
on
nectar
and
ambrosia
;
and
not
the
least
delight
of
the
entertainment
be
the
smile
of
gratification
with
which
our
hostess
regard
us
,
as
we
satisfy
our
famished
appetite
on
the
delicate
fare
she
liberally
supply
.
  
<EOS>
tea
over
and
the
tray
remove
,
she
again
summon
us
to
the
fire
;
we
sit
one
on
each
side
of
her
,
and
now
a
conversation
follow
between
her
and
Helen
,
which
it
be
indeed
a
privilege
to
be
admit
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
have
always
something
of
serenity
in
her
air
,
of
state
in
her
mien
,
of
refined
propriety
in
her
language
,
which
preclude
deviation
into
the
ardent
,
the
excite
,
the
eager
:
<EOS>
something
which
chasten
the
pleasure
of
those
who
look
on
her
and
listen
to
her
,
by
a
controlling
sense
of
awe
;
and
such
be
my
feeling
now
:
<EOS>
but
as
to
Helen
Burns
,
I
be
strike
with
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
the
refreshing
meal
,
the
brilliant
fire
,
the
presence
and
kindness
of
her
beloved
instructress
,
or
,
perhaps
,
more
than
all
these
,
something
in
her
own
unique
mind
,
have
rouse
her
power
within
her
.
<EOS>
They
wake
,
they
kindle
:
<EOS>
first
,
they
glow
in
the
bright
tint
of
her
cheek
,
which
till
this
hour
I
have
never
see
but
pale
and
bloodless
;
then
they
shine
in
the
liquid
lustre
of
her
eye
,
which
have
suddenly
acquire
a
beauty
more
singular
than
that
of
Miss
Temple
's
 
a
beauty
neither
of
fine
colour
nor
long
eyelash
,
nor
pencil
brow
,
but
of
meaning
,
of
movement
,
of
radiance
.
<EOS>
then
her
soul
sit
on
her
lip
,
and
language
flow
,
from
what
source
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
have
a
girl
of
fourteen
a
heart
large
enough
,
vigorous
enough
,
to
hold
the
swell
spring
of
pure
,
full
,
fervid
eloquence
?
<EOS>
such
be
the
characteristic
of
Helen
's
discourse
on
that
,
to
me
,
memorable
evening
;
her
spirit
seem
hasten
to
live
within
a
very
brief
span
as
much
as
many
live
during
a
protract
existence
.
  
<EOS>
They
converse
of
thing
I
have
never
hear
of
;
of
nation
and
time
past
;
of
country
far
away
;
of
secret
of
nature
discover
or
guess
at
:
they
speak
of
book
:
how
many
they
have
read
!
<EOS>
what
store
of
knowledge
they
possess
!
<EOS>
then
they
seem
so
familiar
with
french
name
and
french
author
:
but
my
amazement
reach
its
climax
when
Miss
Temple
ask
Helen
if
she
sometimes
snatch
a
moment
to
recall
the
Latin
her
father
have
teach
her
,
and
take
a
book
from
a
shelf
,
bade
her
read
and
construe
a
page
of
Virgil
;
and
Helen
obey
,
my
organ
of
veneration
expand
at
every
sound
line
.
<EOS>
She
have
scarcely
finish
ere
the
bell
announce
bedtime
!
<EOS>
no
delay
could
be
admit
;
Miss
Temple
embrace
us
both
,
say
,
as
she
draw
us
to
her
heart
    
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
my
child
!
"
  
<EOS>
Helen
she
hold
a
little
longer
than
me
:
she
let
her
go
more
reluctantly
;
it
be
Helen
her
eye
follow
to
the
door
;
it
be
for
her
she
a
second
time
breathe
a
sad
sigh
;
for
her
she
wipe
a
tear
from
her
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
on
reach
the
bedroom
,
we
hear
the
voice
of
Miss
Scatcherd
:
she
be
examine
drawer
;
she
have
just
pull
out
Helen
Burns
's
,
and
when
we
enter
Helen
be
greet
with
a
sharp
reprimand
,
and
tell
that
to
-
morrow
she
should
have
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
untidily
fold
article
pin
to
her
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
thing
be
indeed
in
shameful
disorder
,
"
murmur
Helen
to
me
,
in
a
low
voice
:
"
I
intend
to
have
arrange
them
,
but
I
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
next
morning
,
Miss
Scatcherd
write
in
conspicuous
character
on
a
piece
of
pasteboard
the
word
"
Slattern
,
"
and
bind
it
like
a
phylactery
round
Helen
's
large
,
mild
,
intelligent
,
and
benign
-
looking
forehead
.
<EOS>
She
wear
it
till
evening
,
patient
,
unresentful
,
regard
it
as
a
deserved
punishment
.
<EOS>
the
moment
Miss
Scatcherd
withdraw
after
afternoon
school
,
I
run
to
Helen
,
tear
it
off
,
and
thrust
it
into
the
fire
:
the
fury
of
which
she
be
incapable
have
be
burn
in
my
soul
all
day
,
and
tear
,
hot
and
large
,
have
continually
be
scald
my
cheek
;
for
the
spectacle
of
her
sad
resignation
give
me
an
intolerable
pain
at
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
week
subsequently
to
the
incident
above
<EOS>
narrate
,
Miss
Temple
,
who
have
write
to
Mr.
Lloyd
,
receive
his
answer
<EOS>
:
it
appear
that
what
he
say
go
to
corroborate
my
account
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
,
have
assemble
the
whole
school
,
announce
that
inquiry
have
be
make
into
the
charge
allege
against
Jane
Eyre
,
and
that
she
be
most
happy
to
be
able
to
pronounce
her
completely
clear
from
every
imputation
.
<EOS>
the
teacher
then
shake
hand
with
me
and
kiss
me
,
and
a
murmur
of
pleasure
run
through
the
rank
of
my
companion
.
  
<EOS>
thus
relieve
of
a
grievous
load
,
I
from
that
hour
set
to
work
afresh
,
resolve
to
pioneer
my
way
through
every
difficulty
:
I
toil
hard
,
and
my
success
be
proportionate
to
my
effort
;
my
memory
,
not
naturally
tenacious
,
improve
with
practice
;
exercise
sharpen
my
wit
;
in
a
few
week
I
be
promote
to
a
high
class
;
in
less
than
two
month
I
be
allow
to
commence
French
and
draw
.
<EOS>
I
learn
the
first
two
tense
of
the
verb
_
Etre
_
,
and
sketch
my
first
cottage
(
whose
wall
,
by
-
the-
bye
,
outrivalle
in
slope
those
of
the
lean
tower
of
Pisa
)
,
on
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
that
night
,
on
go
to
bed
,
I
forgot
to
prepare
in
imagination
the
Barmecide
supper
of
hot
roast
potato
,
or
white
bread
and
new
milk
,
with
which
I
be
will
not
to
amuse
my
inward
craving
:
<EOS>
I
feast
instead
on
the
spectacle
of
ideal
drawing
,
which
I
see
in
the
dark
;
all
the
work
of
my
own
hand
:
freely
pencilled
house
and
tree
,
picturesque
rock
and
ruin
,
Cuyp
-
like
group
of
cattle
,
sweet
painting
of
butterfly
hover
over
unblown
rose
,
of
bird
pick
at
ripe
cherry
,
of
wren
's
nest
enclose
pearl
-
like
egg
,
wreathe
about
with
young
ivy
spray
.
<EOS>
I
examine
,
too
,
in
thought
,
the
possibility
of
my
ever
be
able
to
translate
currently
a
certain
little
french
story
which
Madame
Pierrot
have
that
day
show
me
;
nor
be
that
problem
solve
to
my
satisfaction
ere
<EOS>
I
fall
sweetly
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
well
have
Solomon
say
 
"
Better
be
a
dinner
of
herb
where
love
be
,
than
a
stall
ox
and
hatred
therewith
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
would
not
now
have
exchange
Lowood
with
all
its
privation
for
Gateshead
and
its
daily
luxury
.
    
<EOS>
but
the
privation
,
or
rather
the
hardship
,
of
Lowood
lessen
.
<EOS>
spring
draw
on
:
she
be
indeed
already
come
;
the
frosts
of
winter
have
cease
;
its
snow
be
melt
,
its
cut
wind
ameliorate
.
<EOS>
My
wretched
foot
,
flay
and
swollen
to
lameness
by
the
sharp
air
of
January
,
begin
to
heal
and
subside
under
the
gentle
breathing
of
April
;
the
night
and
morning
no
longer
by
their
canadian
temperature
freeze
the
very
blood
in
our
vein
;
we
could
now
endure
the
play
-
hour
pass
in
the
garden
:
sometimes
on
a
sunny
day
it
begin
even
to
be
pleasant
and
genial
,
and
a
greenness
grow
over
those
brown
bed
,
which
,
freshen
daily
,
suggest
the
thought
that
Hope
traverse
them
at
night
,
and
leave
each
morning
bright
trace
of
her
step
.
<EOS>
flower

out
amongst
the

on
Thursday
afternoon
(
half
-
holiday
)
we
now
take
walk
,
and
find
still
sweet
flower
opening
by
the
wayside
,
under
the
hedge
.
  
<EOS>
I
discover
,
too
,
that
a
great
pleasure
,
an
enjoyment
which
the
horizon
only
bound
,
lie
all
outside
the
high
and
spike
-
guard
wall
of
our
garden
:
this
pleasure
consist
in
prospect
of
noble
summit
girdle
a
great
hill
-
hollow
,
rich
in
verdure
and
shadow
;
in
a
bright
beck
,
full
of
dark
stone
and
sparkling
eddy
.
<EOS>
how
different
have
this
scene
look
when
I
view
it
lay
out
beneath
the
iron
sky
of
winter
,
stiffen
in
frost
,
shroud
with
snow
!
 
<EOS>
when
mist
as
chill
as
death
wander
to
the
impulse
of
east
wind
along
those
purple
peak
,
and
roll
down
"
ing
"
and
holm
till
they
blend
with
the
frozen
fog
of
the
beck
!
<EOS>
that
beck
itself
be
then
a
torrent
,
turbid
and
curbless
:
it
tear
asunder
the
wood
,
and
send
a
raving
sound
through
the
air
,
often
thicken
with
wild
rain
or
whirl
sleet
;
and
for
the
forest
on
its
bank
,
_
that
_
show
only
rank
of
skeleton
.
  
<EOS>
April
advance
to
May
:
a
bright
serene
<EOS>
May
it
be
;
day
of
blue
sky
,
placid
sunshine
,
and
soft
western
or
southern
gale
fill
up
its
duration
.
<EOS>
and
now
vegetation
mature
with
vigour
;
Lowood
shake
loose
its
tress
;
it
become
all
green
,
all
flowery
;
its
great
elm
,
ash
,
and
oak
skeleton
be
restore
to
majestic
life
;
woodland
plant
spring
up
profusely
in
its
recess
;
unnumbered
variety
of
moss
fill
its
hollow
,
and
it
make
a
strange
ground
-
sunshine
out
of
the
wealth
of
its
wild
primrose
plant
<EOS>
:
I
have
see
their
pale
gold
gleam
in
overshadowed
spot
like
scattering
of
the
sweetest
lustre
.
<EOS>
all
this
I
enjoy
often
and
fully
,
free
,
unwatched
,
and
almost
alone
:
for
this
unwonted
liberty
and
pleasure
there
be
a
cause
,
to
which
it
now
become
my
task
to
advert
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
not
describe
a
pleasant
site
for
a
dwelling
,
when
I
speak
of
it
as
bosom
in
hill
and
wood
,
and
rise
from
the
verge
of
a
stream
?
<EOS>
assuredly
,
pleasant
enough
:
but
whether
healthy
or
not
be
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
that
forest
-
dell
,
where
Lowood
lie
,
be
the
cradle
of
fog
and
fog
-
breed
pestilence
;
which
,
quicken
with
the
quicken
spring
,
creep
into
the
Orphan
Asylum
,
breathe
typhus
through
its
crowded
schoolroom
and
dormitory
,
and
,
ere
May
arrive
,
transform
the
seminary
into
an
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
semi
-
starvation
and
neglect
cold
have
predispose
most
of
the
pupil
to
receive
infection
:
forty
-
five
out
of
the
eighty
girl
lie
ill
at
one
time
.
<EOS>
class
be
break
up
,
rule
relaxed
.
<EOS>
the
few
who
continue
well
be
allow
almost
unlimited
license
;
because
the
medical
attendant
insist
on
the
necessity
of
frequent
exercise
to
keep
them
in
health
:
and
have
it
be
otherwise
,
no
one
have
leisure
to
watch
or
restrain
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
's
whole
attention
be
absorb
by
the
patient
:
she
live
in
the
sick
-
room
,
never
quit
it
except
to
snatch
a
few
hour
'
rest
at
night
.
<EOS>
the
teacher
be
fully
occupy
with
pack
up
and
make
other
necessary
preparation
for
the
departure
of
those
girl
who
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
friend
and
relation
able
and
willing
to
remove
them
from
the
seat
of
contagion
.
<EOS>
many
,
already
smitten
,
go
home
only
to
die
:
<EOS>
some
die
at
the
school
,
and
be
bury
quietly
and
quickly
,
the
nature
of
the
malady
forbidding
delay
.
  
<EOS>
while
disease
have
thus
become
an
inhabitant
of
Lowood
,
and
death
its
frequent
visitor
;
while
there
be
gloom
and
fear
within
its
wall
;
while
its
room
and
passage
steam
with
hospital
smell
,
the
drug
and
the
pastille
strive
vainly
to
overcome
the
effluvia
of
mortality
,
that
bright
May
shone
unclouded
over
the
bold
hill
and
beautiful
woodland
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
Its
garden
,
too
,
glow
with
flower
:
hollyhock
have
spring
up
tall
as
tree
,
lily
have
open
,
tulip
and
rose
be
in
bloom
;
the
border
of
the
little
bed
be
gay
with
pink
thrift
and
crimson
double
daisy
;
the
sweetbriar
give
out
,
morning
and
evening
,
their
scent
of
spice
and
apple
;
and
these
fragrant
treasure
be
all
useless
for
most
of
the
inmate
of
Lowood
,
except
to
furnish
now
and
then
a
handful
of
herb
and
blossom
to
put
in
a
coffin
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
,
and
the
rest
who
continue
well
,
enjoy
fully
the
beauty
of
the
scene
and
season
;
they
let
us
ramble
in
the
wood
,
like
gipsy
,
from
morning
till
night
;
we
do
what
we
like
,
go
where
we
like
:
we
live
better
too
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
and
his
family
never
come
near
Lowood
now
:
household
matter
be
not
scrutinise
into
;
the
cross
housekeeper
be
go
,
drive
away
by
the
fear
of
infection
;
her
successor
,
who
have
be
matron
at
the
Lowton
Dispensary
,
unused
to
the
way
of
her
new
abode
,
provide
with
comparative
liberality
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
few
to
feed
;
the
sick
could
eat
little
;
our
breakfast
-
basin
be
better
fill
;
when
there
be
no
time
to
prepare
a
regular
dinner
,
which
often
happen
,
she
would
give
us
a
large
piece
of
cold
pie
,
or
a
thick
slice
of
bread
and
cheese
,
and
this
we
carry
away
with
us
to
the
wood
,
where
we
each
choose
the
spot
we
like
best
,
and
dine
sumptuously
.
  
<EOS>
My
favourite
seat
be
a
smooth
and
broad
stone
,
rise
white
and
dry
from
the
very
middle
of
the
beck
,
and
only
to
be
get
at
by
wade
through
the
water
;
a
feat
I
accomplish
barefoot
.
<EOS>
the
stone
be
just
broad
enough
to
accommodate
,
comfortably
,
another
girl
and
me
,
at
that
time
my
choose
comrade
 
<EOS>
one
Mary
Ann
Wilson
;
a
shrewd
,
observant
personage
,
whose
society
I
take
pleasure
in
,
partly
because
she
be
witty
and
original
,
and
partly
because
she
have
a
manner
which
set
me
at
my
ease
.
<EOS>
some
year
old
than
I
,
she
know
more
of
the
world
,
and
could
tell
me
many
thing
I
like
to
hear
:
with
her
my
curiosity
find
gratification
:
<EOS>
to
my
fault
also
she
give
ample
indulgence
,
never
impose
curb
or
rein
on
anything
I
say
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
turn
for
narrative
,
I
for
analysis
;
she
like
to
inform
,
I
to
question
;
so
we
get
on
swimmingly
together
,
derive
much
entertainment
,
if
not
much
improvement
,
from
our
mutual
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
and
where
,
meantime
,
be
Helen
Burns
?
<EOS>
why
do
I
not
spend
these
sweet
day
of
liberty
with
her
?
<EOS>
have
I
forget
her
?
<EOS>
or
be
I
so
worthless
as
to
have
grow
tired
of
her
pure
society
?
<EOS>
surely
the
Mary
Ann
Wilson
I
have
mention
be
inferior
to
my
first
acquaintance
:
she
could
only
tell
me
amusing
story
,
and
reciprocate
any
racy
and
pungent
gossip
<EOS>
I
choose
to
indulge
in
;
while
,
if
I
have
speak
truth
of
Helen
,
she
be
qualified
to
give
those
who
enjoy
the
privilege
of
her
converse
a
taste
of
far
high
thing
.
  
<EOS>
true
,
reader
;
and
I
know
and
feel
this
:
and
though
I
be
a
defective
being
,
with
many
fault
and
few
redeem
point
,
yet
I
never
tired
of
Helen
Burns
;
nor
ever
cease
to
cherish
for
her
a
sentiment
of
attachment
,
as
strong
,
tender
,
and
respectful
as
any
that
ever
animate
my
heart
.
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
otherwise
,
when
Helen
,
at
all
time
and
under
all
circumstance
,
evince
for
me
a
quiet
and
faithful
friendship
,
which
ill
-
humour
never
sour
,
nor
irritation
never
trouble
?
<EOS>
but
Helen
be
ill
at
present
:
for
some
week
she
have
be
remove
from
my
sight
to
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
room
upstairs
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
,
I
be
tell
,
in
the
hospital
portion
of
the
house
with
the
fever
patient
;
for
her
complaint
be
consumption
,
not
typhus
:
and
by
consumption
I
,
in
my
ignorance
,
understand
something
mild
,
which
time
and
care
would
be
sure
to
alleviate
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
confirm
in
this
idea
by
the
fact
of
her
once
or
twice
come
downstairs
on
very
warm
sunny
afternoon
,
and
be
take
by
Miss
Temple
into
the
garden
;
but
,
on
these
occasion
,
I
be
not
allow
to
go
and
speak
to
her
;
I
only
see
her
from
the
schoolroom
window
,
and
then
not
distinctly
;
for
she
be
much
wrap
up
,
and
sit
at
a
distance
under
the
verandah
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
,
in
the
beginning
of
June
,
I
have
stay
out
very
late
with
Mary
Ann
in
the
wood
;
we
have
,
as
usual
,
separate
ourselves
from
the
other
,
and
have
wander
far
;
so
far
that
we
lose
our
way
,
and
have
to
ask
it
at
a
lonely
cottage
,
where
a
man
and
woman
live
,
who
look
after
a
herd
of
half
-
wild
swine
that
feed
on
the
mast
in
the
wood
.
<EOS>
when
we
get
back
,
it
be
after
moonrise
:
<EOS>
a
pony
,
which
we
know
to
be
the
surgeon
's
,
be
stand
at
the
garden
door
.
<EOS>
Mary
Ann
remark
that
she
suppose
some
one
must
be
very
ill
,
as
Mr.
Bates
have
be
send
for
at
that
time
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
She
go
into
the
house
;
I
stay
behind
a
few
minute
to
plant
in
my
garden
a
handful
of
root
I
have
dig
up
in
the
forest
,
and
<EOS>
which
I
fear
would
wither
if
I
leave
them
till
the
morning
.
<EOS>
this
do
,
I
linger
yet
a
little
longer
:
the
flower
smell
so
sweet
as
the
dew
fall
;
it
be
such
a
pleasant
evening
,
so
serene
,
so
warm
;
<EOS>
the
still
glow
west
promise
so
fairly
another
fine
day
on
the
morrow
;
the
moon
rise
with
such
majesty
in
the
grave
east
.
<EOS>
I
be
note
these
thing
and
enjoy
them
as
a
child
may
,
when
it
enter
my
mind
as
it
have
never
do
before
:
    
"
how
sad
to
be
lie
now
on
a
sick
bed
,
and
to
be
in
danger
of
die
!
<EOS>
this
world
be
pleasant
 
it
would
be
dreary
to
be
call
from
it
,
and
to
have
to
go
who
know
where
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
my
mind
make
its
first
earnest
effort
to
comprehend
what
have
be
infuse
into
it
concern
heaven
and
hell
;
and
for
the
first
time
it
recoil
,
baffle
;
and
for
the
first
time
glance
behind
,
on
each
side
,
and
before
it
,
it
see
all
round
an
unfathomed
gulf
:
it
feel
the
one
point
where
it
stand
 
the
present
;
all
the
rest
be
formless
cloud
and
vacant
depth
;
and
it
shudder
at
the
thought
of
tottering
,
and
plunge
amid
that
chaos
.
<EOS>
while
ponder
this
new
idea
,
I
hear
the
front
door
open
;
Mr.
Bates
come
out
,
and
with
him
be
a
nurse
.
<EOS>
after
she
have
see
him
mount
his
horse
and
depart
<EOS>
,
she
be
about
to
close
the
door
,
but
I
run
up
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
Helen
Burns
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
poorly
,
"
be
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
her
<EOS>
Mr.
Bates
have
be
to
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
he
say
about
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
say
she
will
not
be
here
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
phrase
,
utter
in
my
hearing
yesterday
,
would
have
only
convey
the
notion
that
she
be
about
to
be
remove
to
Northumberland
,
to
her
own
home
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
suspect
that
it
mean
she
be
die
;
but
I
know
instantly
now
!
<EOS>
It
open
clear
on
my
comprehension
that
Helen
Burns
be
number
her
last
day
in
this
world
,
and
that
she
be
go
to
be
take
to
the
region
of
spirit
,
if
such
region
there
be
.
<EOS>
I
experience
a
shock
of
horror
,
<EOS>
then
a
strong
thrill
of
grief
,
<EOS>
then
a
desire
 
a
necessity
to
see
her
;
and
I
ask
in
what
room
she
lie
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
in
Miss
Temple
's
room
,
"
say
the
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
go
up
and
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
child
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
;
and
now
it
be
time
for
you
to
come
in
;
you
will
catch
the
fever
if
you
stop
out
when
the
dew
be
fall
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
nurse
close
the
front
door
;
I
go
in
by
the
side
entrance
which
lead
to
the
schoolroom
:
<EOS>
I
be
just
in
time
;
it
be
nine
o'clock
,
and
Miss
Miller
be
call
the
pupil
to
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
two
hour
later
,
probably
near
eleven
,
when
I
 
not
have
be
able
to
fall
asleep
,
and
deem
,
from
the
perfect
silence
of
the
dormitory
,
that
my
companion
be
all
wrapt
in
profound
repose
 
rise
softly
,
put
on
my
frock
over
my
night
-
dress
,
and
,
without
shoe
,
creep
from
the
apartment
,
and
set
off
in
quest
of
Miss
Temple
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
;
but
I
know
my
way
;
and
the
light
of
the
unclouded
summer
moon
,
enter
here
and
there
at
passage
window
,
enable
me
to
find
it
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
an
odour
of
camphor
and
burn
vinegar
warn
me
when
I
come
near
the
fever
room
:
and
I
pass
its
door
quickly
,
fearful
lest
the
nurse
who
sit
up
all
night
should
hear
me
.
<EOS>
I
dread
be
discover
and
send
back
;
for
I
_
must
_
see
Helen
,
 
<EOS>
I
must
embrace
her
before
she
die
,
 
I
must
give
her
one
last
kiss
,
exchange
with
her
one
last
word
.
  
<EOS>
have
descend
a
staircase
,
traverse
a
portion
of
the
house
below
,
and
succeed
in
opening
and
shutting
,
without
noise
,
two
door
,
I
reach
another
flight
of
step
;
these
I
mount
,
and
then
just
opposite
to
me
be
Miss
Temple
's
room
.
<EOS>
a
light
shine
through
the
keyhole
and
from
under
the
door
;
a
profound
stillness
pervade
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
come
near
,
I
find
the
door
slightly
ajar
;
probably
to
admit
some
fresh
air
into
the
close
abode
of
sickness
.
<EOS>
indispose
to
hesitate
,
and
full
of
impatient
impulse
 
soul
and
sense
quiver
with
keen
throe
 
<EOS>
I
put
it
back
and
look
in
.
<EOS>
My
eye
seek
Helen
,
and
fear
to
find
death
.
  
<EOS>
close
by
Miss
Temple
's
bed
,
and
half
covered
with
its
white
curtain
,
there
stand
a
little
crib
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
outline
of
a
form
under
the
clothe
,
but
the
face
be
hide
by
the
hanging
:
<EOS>
the
nurse
I
have
speak
to
in
the
garden
sit
in
an
easy
-
chair
asleep
;
an
unsnuffed
candle
burn
dimly
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
be
not
to
be
see
:
I
know
afterwards
that
she
have
be
call
to
a
delirious
patient
in
the
fever
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
advance
;
then
pause
by
the
crib
side
:
<EOS>
my
hand
be
on
the
curtain
,
but
I
prefer
speak
before
I
withdraw
it
.
<EOS>
I
still
recoil
at
the
dread
of
see
a
corpse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Helen
!
<EOS>
"
I
whisper
softly
,
"
be
you
awake
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
stir
herself
,
put
back
the
curtain
,
and
I
see
her
face
,
pale
,
waste
,
but
quite
composed
:
she
look
so
little
changed
that
my
fear
be
instantly
dissipate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
it
be
you
,
Jane
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
in
her
own
gentle
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
I
think
,
"
she
be
not
go
to
die
;
they
be
mistaken
:
she
could
not
speak
and
look
so
calmly
if
she
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
get
on
to
her
crib
and
kiss
her
:
<EOS>
her
forehead
be
cold
,
and
her
cheek
both
cold
and
thin
,
and
so
be
her
hand
and
wrist
;
but
she
smile
as
of
old
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
you
come
here
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
It
be
past
eleven
o'clock
:
<EOS>
I
hear
it
strike
some
minute
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
see
you
,
Helen
<EOS>
:
I
hear
you
be
very
ill
,
and
I
could
not
sleep
till
I
have
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
to
bid
me
good
-
bye
,
then
:
you
be
just
in
time
probably
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
you
go
somewhere
,
Helen
?
<EOS>
be
you
go
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
to
my
long
home
 
my
last
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
Helen
!
"
I
stop
,
distressed
.
<EOS>
while
I
try
to
devour
my
tear
,
a
fit
of
cough
seize
Helen
;
it
do
not
,
however
,
wake
the
nurse
;
when
it
be
over
,
she
lie
some
minute
exhaust
;
then
she
whisper
    
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
your
little
foot
be
bare
;
lie
down
and
cover
yourself
with
my
quilt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
so
:
she
put
her
arm
over
me
,
and
I
nestle
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
after
a
long
silence
,
she
resume
,
still
whisper
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
happy
,
Jane
;
and
when
you
hear
that
I
be
dead
,
you
must
be
sure
and
not
grieve
:
there
be
nothing
to
grieve
about
.
<EOS>
We
all
must
die
one
day
,
and
the
illness
which
be
remove
me
be
not
painful
;
it
be
gentle
and
gradual
:
<EOS>
my
mind
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
I
leave
no
one
to
regret
me
much
:
I
have
only
a
father
;
and
he
be
lately
married
,
and
will
not
miss
me
.
<EOS>
by
die
young
,
I
shall
escape
great
suffering
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
quality
or
talent
to
make
my
way
very
well
in
the
world
:
I
should
have
be
continually
at
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
where
be
you
go
to
,
Helen
?
<EOS>
Can
you
see
?
<EOS>
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
;
I
have
faith
:
I
be
go
to
God
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
God
?
<EOS>
what
be
God
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
maker
and
your
,
who
will
never
destroy
what
He
create
.
<EOS>
I
rely
implicitly
on
His
power
,
and
confide
wholly
in
His
goodness
<EOS>
:
I
count
the
hour
till
that
eventful
one
arrive
which
shall
restore
me
to
Him
,
reveal
Him
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
,
then
,
Helen
,
that
there
be
such
a
place
as
heaven
,
and
that
our
soul
can
get
to
it
when
we
die
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
there
be
a
future
state
;
I
believe
God
be
good
;
I
can
resign
my
immortal
part
to
Him
without
any
misgiving
.
<EOS>
God
be
my
father
;
God
be
my
friend
:
<EOS>
I
love
Him
;
I
believe
He
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
shall
I
see
you
again
,
Helen
,
when
I
die
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
to
the
same
region
of
happiness
:
be
receive
by
the
same
mighty
,
universal
Parent
,
no
doubt
,
dear
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
I
question
,
but
this
time
only
in
thought
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
that
region
?
<EOS>
do
it
exist
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
clasp
my
arm
closer
round
Helen
;
she
seem
dearer
to
me
than
ever
;
I
feel
as
if
I
could
not
let
her
go
;
I
lie
with
my
face
hide
on
her
neck
.
<EOS>
presently
she
say
,
in
the
sweetest
tone
    
<EOS>
"
how
comfortable
I
be
!
<EOS>
that
last
fit
of
coughing
have
tire
me
a
little
;
I
feel
as
if
I
could
sleep
:
but
do
not
leave
me
,
Jane
;
I
like
to
have
you
near
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
stay
with
you
,
_
dear
_
Helen
:
no
one
shall
take
me
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
warm
,
darling
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
"
good
-
night
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
night
,
Helen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
kiss
me
,
and
I
her
,
and
we
both
soon
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
awake
it
be
day
:
an
unusual
movement
rouse
me
;
I
look
up
;
I
be
in
somebody
's
arm
;
the
nurse
hold
me
;
she
be
carry
me
through
the
passage
back
to
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
reprimand
for
leave
my
bed
;
people
have
something
else
to
think
about
;
no
explanation
be
afford
then
to
my
many
question
;
but
a
day
or
two
afterwards
I
learn
that
Miss
Temple
,
on
return
to
her
own
room
at
dawn
,
have
find
me
lay
in
the
little
crib
;
my
face
against
Helen
Burns
's
shoulder
,
my
arm
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
I
be
asleep
,
and
Helen
be
 
dead
.
  
<EOS>
Her
grave
be
in
Brocklebridge
churchyard
:
for
fifteen
year
after
her
death
it
be
only
cover
by
a
grassy
mound
;
but
now
a
grey
marble
tablet
mark
the
spot
,
inscribe
with
her
name
,
and
the
word
"
Resurgam
.
"
    
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
I
have
record
in
detail
the
event
of
my
insignificant
existence
:
to
the
first
ten
year
of
my
life
I
have
give
almost
as
many
chapter
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
to
be
a
regular
autobiography
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
bind
to
invoke
memory
where
I
know
her
response
will
possess
some
degree
of
interest
;
therefore
I
now
pass
a
space
of
eight
year
almost
in
silence
:
a
few
line
only
be
necessary
to
keep
up
the
link
of
connection
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
typhus
fever
have
fulfil
its
mission
of
devastation
at
Lowood
,
it
gradually
disappear
from
thence
;
but
not
till
its
virulence
and
the
number
of
its
victim
have
draw
public
attention
on
the
school
.
<EOS>
Inquiry
be
make
into
the
origin
of
the
scourge
,
and
by
degree
various
fact
come
out
which
excite
public
indignation
in
a
high
degree
.
<EOS>
the
unhealthy
nature
of
the
site
;
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
child
's
food
;
the
brackish
,
fetid
water
use
in
its
preparation
;
the
pupil
'
wretched
clothing
and
accommodation
 
all
these
thing
be
discover
,
and
the
discovery
produce
a
result
mortifying
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
but
beneficial
to
the
institution
.
  
<EOS>
several
wealthy
and
benevolent
individual
in
the
county
subscribe
largely
for
the
erection
of
a
more
convenient
building
in
a
well
situation
;
new
regulation
be
make
;
improvement
in
diet
and
clothing
introduce
;
the
fund
of
the
school
be
intrust
to
the
management
of
a
committee
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
who
,
from
his
wealth
and
family
connection
,
could
not
be
overlook
,
still
retain
the
post
of
treasurer
;
but
he
be
aid
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
by
gentleman
of
rather
more
enlarged
and
sympathise
mind
:
his
office
of
inspector
,
too
,
be
share
by
those
who
know
how
to
combine
reason
with
strictness
,
comfort
with
economy
,
compassion
with
uprightness
.
<EOS>
the
school
,
thus
improve
,
become
in
time
a
truly
useful
and
noble
institution
.
<EOS>
I
remain
an
inmate
of
its
wall
,
after
its
regeneration
,
for
eight
year
:
six
as
pupil
,
and
two
as
teacher
;
and
in
both
capacity
I
bear
my
testimony
to
its
value
and
importance
.
  
<EOS>
during
these
eight
year
my
life
be
uniform
:
but
not
unhappy
,
because
it
be
not
inactive
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
mean
of
an
excellent
education
place
within
my
reach
;
a
fondness
for
some
of
my
study
,
and
a
desire
to
excel
in
all
,
together
with
a
great
delight
in
please
my
teacher
,
especially
such
as
I
love
,
urge
me
on
:
I
avail
myself
fully
of
the
advantage
offer
me
.
<EOS>
in
time
I
rise
to
be
the
first
girl
of
the
first
class
;
then
I
be
invest
with
the
office
of
teacher
;
which
I
discharge
with
zeal
for
two
year
:
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
I
alter
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Temple
,
through
all
change
,
have
thus
far
continue
superintendent
of
the
seminary
:
to
her
instruction
I
owe
the
good
part
of
my
acquirement
;
her
friendship
and
society
have
be
my
continual
solace
;
she
have
stand
me
in
the
stead
of
mother
,
governess
,
and
,
latterly
,
companion
.
<EOS>
at
this
period
she
marry
,
remove
with
her
husband
(
a
clergyman
,
an
excellent
man
,
almost
worthy
of
such
a
wife
)
to
a
distant
county
,
and
consequently
be
lose
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
day
she
leave
I
be
no
longer
the
same
:
with
her
be
go
every
settle
feeling
,
every
association
that
have
make
Lowood
in
some
degree
a
home
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
imbibe
from
her
something
of
her
nature
and
much
of
her
habit
:
more
harmonious
thought
:
<EOS>
what
seem
better
regulated
feeling
have
become
the
inmate
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
have
give
in
allegiance
to
duty
and
order
;
I
be
quiet
;
I
believe
I
be
content
:
to
the
eye
of
other
,
usually
even
to
my
own
,
I
appear
a
disciplined
and
subdued
character
.
  
<EOS>
but
destiny
,
in
the
shape
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Nasmyth
,
come
between
me
and
Miss
Temple
<EOS>
:
I
see
her
in
her
travel
dress
step
into
a
post
-
chaise
,
shortly
after
the
marriage
ceremony
;
I
watch
the
chaise
mount
the
hill
and
disappear
beyond
its
brow
;
and
then
retire
to
my
own
room
,
and
there
spend
in
solitude
the
great
part
of
the
half
-
holiday
grant
in
honour
of
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
about
the
chamber
most
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
myself
only
to
be
regret
my
loss
,
and
think
how
to
repair
it
;
but
when
my
reflection
be
conclude
,
and
I
look
up
and
find
that
the
afternoon
be
go
,
and
evening
far
advanced
,
another
discovery
dawn
on
me
,
namely
,
that
in
the
interval
I
have
undergo
a
transforming
process
;
that
my
mind
have
put
off
all
it
have
borrow
of
Miss
Temple
 
or
rather
that
she
have
take
with
her
the
serene
atmosphere
I
have
be
breathe
in
her
vicinity
 
and
that
now
I
be
leave
in
my
natural
element
,
and
begin
to
feel
the
stirring
of
old
emotion
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
seem
as
if
a
prop
be
withdraw
,
but
rather
as
if
a
motive
be
go
:
it
be
not
the
power
to
be
tranquil
which
have
fail
me
,
but
the
reason
for
tranquillity
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
My
world
have
for
some
year
be
in
Lowood
:
my
experience
have
be
of
its
rule
and
system
;
now
I
remember
that
the
real
world
be
wide
,
and
that
a
varied
field
of
hope
and
fear
,
of
sensation
and
excitement
,
await
those
who
have
courage
to
go
forth
into
its
expanse
,
to
seek
real
knowledge
of
life
amidst
its
peril
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
window
,
open
it
,
and
look
out
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
two
wing
of
the
building
;
there
be
the
garden
;
there
be
the
skirt
of
Lowood
;
there
be
the
hilly
horizon
.
<EOS>
My
eye
pass
all
other
object
to
rest
on
those
most
remote
,
the
blue
peak
;
it
be
those
I
long
to
surmount
;
all
within
their
boundary
of
rock
and
heath
seem
prison
-
grind
,
exile
limit
.
<EOS>
I
trace
the
white
road
winding
round
the
base
of
one
mountain
,
and
vanish
in
a
gorge
between
two
;
how
I
long
to
follow
it
farther
!
<EOS>
I
recall
the
time
when
I
have
travel
that
very
road
in
a
coach
;
I
remember
descend
that
hill
at
twilight
;
an
age
seem
to
have
elapse
since
the
day
which
bring
me
first
to
Lowood
,
and
I
have
never
quit
it
since
.
<EOS>
My
vacation
have
all
be
spend
at
school
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
have
never
send
for
me
to
Gateshead
;
neither
she
nor
any
of
her
family
have
ever
be
to
visit
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
no
communication
by
letter
or
message
with
the
outer
world
:
school
-
rule
,
school
-
duty
,
school
-
habit
and
notion

and
preference
,
and
antipathy
 
<EOS>
such
be
what
I
know
of
existence
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
feel
that
it
be
not
enough
;
I
tire
of
the
routine
of
eight
year
in
one
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
desire
liberty
;
for
liberty
I
gasp
;
for
liberty
I
utter
a
prayer
;
it
seem
scatter
on
the
wind
then
faintly
blow
.
<EOS>
I
abandon
it
and
frame
a
humble
supplication
;
for
change
,
stimulus
:
<EOS>
that
petition
,
too
,
seem
sweep
off
into
vague
space
:
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
I
cry
,
half
desperate
,
"
grant
me
at
least
a
new
servitude
!
"
  
<EOS>
here
a
bell
,
ring
the
hour
of
supper
,
call
me
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
free
to
resume
the
interrupted
chain
of
my
reflection
till
bedtime
:
even
then
a
teacher
who
occupy
the
same
room
with
me
keep
me
from
the
subject
to
which
I
long
to
recur
,
by
a
prolonged
effusion
of
small
talk
.
<EOS>
how
I
wish
sleep
would
silence
her
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
,
could
I
but
go
back
to
the
idea
which
have
last
enter
my
mind
as
I
stand
at
the
window
,
some
inventive
suggestion
would
rise
for
my
relief
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Gryce
snore
at
last
;
she
be
a
heavy
Welshwoman
,
and
till
now
her
habitual
nasal
strain
have
never
be
regard
by
me
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
nuisance
;
to
-
night
I
hail
the
first
deep
note
with
satisfaction
;
I
be
debarrasse
of
interruption
;
my
half
-
efface
thought
instantly
revive
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
new
servitude
!
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
that
,
"
I
soliloquise
(
mentally
,
be
it
understand
;
I
do
not
talk
aloud
)
,
"
I
know
there
be
,
because
it
do
not
sound
too
sweet
;
it
be
not
like
such
word
as
Liberty
,
Excitement
,
enjoyment
:
<EOS>
delightful
sound
truly
;
but
no
more
than
sound
for
me
;
and
so
hollow
and
fleeting
that
it
be
mere
waste
of
time
to
listen
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
Servitude
!
<EOS>
that
must
be
matter
of
fact
.
<EOS>
any
one
may
serve
:
I
have
serve
here
eight
year
;
now
all
I
want
be
to
serve
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Can
I
not
get
so
much
of
my
own
will
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
thing
feasible
?
<EOS>
yes
 
yes
 
<EOS>
the
end
be
not
so
difficult
;
if
I
have
only
a
brain
active
enough
to
ferret
out
the
mean
of
attain
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sit
up
in
bed
by
way
of
arouse
this
say
brain
:
it
be
a
chilly
night
;
I
cover
my
shoulder
with
a
shawl
,
and
then
I
proceed
_
to
think
_
again
with
all
my
might
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
want
?
<EOS>
a
new
place
,
in
a
new
house
,
amongst
new
face
,
under
new
circumstance
:
I
want
this
because
it
be
of
no
use
want
anything
better
.
<EOS>
how
do
people
do
to
get
a
new
place
?
<EOS>
They
apply
to
friend
,
I
suppose
:
I
have
no
friend
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
other
who
have
no
friend
,
who
must
look
about
for
themselves
and
be
their
own
helper
;
and
what
be
their
resource
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
:
nothing
answer
me
;
I
then
order
my
brain
to
find
a
response
,
and
quickly
.
<EOS>
It
work
and
work
faster
:
I
feel
the
pulse
throb
in
my
head
and
temple
;
but
for
nearly
an
hour
it
work
in
chaos
;
and
no
result
come
of
its
effort
.
<EOS>
feverish
with
vain
labour
,
I
get
up
and
take
a
turn
in
the
room
;
undrew
the
curtain
,
note
a
star
or
two
,
shiver
with
cold
,
and
again
creep
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
a
kind
fairy
,
in
my
absence
,
have
surely
drop
the
required
suggestion
on
my
pillow
;
for
as
I
lie
down

it
come
quietly

go
over
twice

thrice

<EOS>
this

remain
locked
in
my

all
day
:
after
tea
,
I
ask
leave
of
the
new
superintendent
to
go
to
Lowton
,
in
order
to
perform
some
small
commission
for
myself
and
one

two
of
my
fellow

readily
grant
;
I
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
walk
of
two
mile
,
and
the
evening
be
wet
,
but
the
day
be
still
long
;
I
visit
a
shop
or
two
,
slip
the
letter
into
the
post

office
,
and
come
back
through
heavy
rain
,
with
streaming
garment
,
but
with
a
relieved
heart
.
  
<EOS>
the
succeed
week
seem
long
:
it
come
to
an
end
at
last
,
however
,
like
all
sublunary
thing
,
and
once
more
,
towards
the
close
of
a
pleasant
autumn
day
,
I
find
myself
afoot
on
the
road
to
Lowton
.
<EOS>
a
picturesque
track
it
be
,
by
the
way
;
lie
along
the
side
of
the
beck
and
through
the
sweetest
curve
of
the
dale
:
but
that
day
I
think
more
of
the
letter
,
that
may
or
may
not
be
await
me
at
the
little
burgh
whither
I
be
bind
,
than
of
the
charm
of
lea
and
water
.
  
<EOS>
My
ostensible
errand
on
this
occasion
be
to
get
measure
for
a
pair
of
shoe
;
so
I
discharge
that
business
first
,
and
when
it
be
do
,
I
step
across
the
clean
and
quiet
little
street
from
the
shoemaker
's
to
the
post
-
office
:
it
be
keep
by
an
old
dame
,
who
wear
horn
spectacle
on
her
nose
,
and
black
mitten
on
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
letter
for
J.E.

<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
She
peer
at
me
over
her
spectacle
,
and
then
she
open
a
drawer
and
fumble
among
its
content
for
a
long
time
,
so
long
that
my
hope
begin
to
falter
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
have
hold
a
document
before
her
glass
for
nearly
five
minute
,
she
present
it
across
the
counter
,
accompany
the
act
by
another
inquisitive
and
mistrustful
glance
 
<EOS>
it

I
demand

<EOS>
"
there
be
no

say
she
;
and
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
turn
my
face
homeward
:
I
could
not
open
it
then
;
rule
oblige
me
to
be
back
by
eight
,
and
it
be
already
half
-
past
seven
.
  
<EOS>
various
duty
await
me
on
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
sit
with
the
girl
during
their
hour
of
study
;
then
it
be
my
turn
to
read
prayer
;
to
see
them
to
bed
:
afterwards
I
sup
with
the
other
teacher
.
<EOS>
even
when
we
finally
retire
for
the
night
,
the
inevitable
Miss
Gryce
be
still
my
companion
:
we
have
only
a
short
end
of
candle
in
our
candlestick
,
and
I
dread
lest
she
should
talk
till
it
be
all
burn
out
;
fortunately
,
however
,
the
heavy
supper
she
have
eat
produce
a
soporific
effect
:
she
be
already
snore
before
I
have
finish
undress
.
<EOS>
there
still
remain
an
inch
of
candle
:
I
now
take
out
my
letter
;
the
seal
be
an
initial
F.
;
I
break
it
;
the
content
be
brief

she
be
in

give
satisfactory

a
situation
can
be

there

one
pupil

a

under
ten

"
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
Thornfield
,
near
Millcote
,
shire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
examine
the
document
long
:
the
writing
be
old
-
fashioned
and
rather
uncertain
,
like
that
of
an
elderly
lady
.
<EOS>
this
circumstance
be
satisfactory
:
a
private
fear
have
haunt
me
,
that
in
thus
act
for
myself
,
and
by
my
own
guidance
,
I
run
the
risk
of
get
into
some
scrape
;
and
,
above
all
thing
,
I
wish
the
result
of
my
endeavour
to
be
respectable
,
proper
,
_
en
regle
_
.
<EOS>
I
now
feel
that
an
elderly
lady
be
no
bad
ingredient
in
the
business
I
have
on
hand
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
I
see
her
in
a
black
gown
and
widow
's
cap
;
frigid
,
perhaps
,
but
not
uncivil
:
a
model
of
elderly
english
respectability
.
<EOS>
Thornfield
!
<EOS>
that
,
doubtless
,
be
the
name
of
her
house
:
a
neat
orderly
spot
,
I
be
sure
;
though
I
fail
in
my
effort
to
conceive
a
correct
plan
of
the
premise
.
<EOS>
Millcote
,
shire
;
I
brush
up
my
recollection
of
the
map
of
England
,
<EOS>
yes
,
I
see
it
;
both
the
shire
and
the
town
.
<EOS>
shire
be
seventy
mile
near
London
than
the
remote
county
where
I
now
reside
:
that
be
a
recommendation
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
go
where
there
be
life
and
movement
:
Millcote
be
a
large
manufacturing
town
on
the
bank
of
the
A-
;
a
busy
place
enough
,
doubtless
:
so
much
the
well
;
it
would
be
a
complete
change
at
least
.
<EOS>
not
that
my
fancy
be
much
captivate
by
the
idea
of
long
chimney
and
cloud
of
smoke
 
"
but
,
"
I
argue
,
"
Thornfield
will
,
probably
,
be
a
good
way
from
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
socket
of
the
candle
drop
,
and
the
wick
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
new
step
be
to
be
take
;
my
plan
could
no
longer
be
confine
to
my
own
breast
;
I
must
impart
them
in
order
to
achieve
their
success
.
<EOS>
have
seek
and
obtain
an
audience
of
the
superintendent
during
the
noontide
recreation
,
I
tell
her
I
have
a
prospect
of
get
a
new
situation
where
the
salary
would
be
double
what
I
now
receive
(
for
at
Lowood
I
only
get
15
pound
per
annum
)
;
and
request
she
would
break
the
matter
for
me
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
or
some
of
the
committee
,
and
ascertain
whether
they
would
permit
me
to
mention
them
as
reference
.
<EOS>
She
obligingly
consent
to
act
as
mediatrix
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
she
lay
the
affair
before
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
who
say
that
Mrs.
Reed
must
be
write
to
,
as
she
be
my
natural
guardian

<EOS>
a
note
be
accordingly
address
to
that
lady

who
return
for
answer
,
that
"
I
may
do
as
I
please
:
she
have
long
relinquish
all
interference
in
my
affair
.
"
<EOS>
this
note
go
the
round
of
the
committee
,
and
at
last
,
after
what
appear
to
me
most
tedious
delay
,
formal
leave
be
give
me
to
better
my
condition
if
I
could
;
and
an
assurance
add
,
that
as
I
have
always
conduct
myself
well
,
both
as
teacher
and
pupil
,
at
Lowood
,
a
testimonial
of
character
and
capacity
,
sign
by
the
inspector
of
that
institution
,
should
forthwith
be
furnish
me

<EOS>
this
testimonial
I
accordingly
receive
in
about
a
month
,
forward
a
copy
of
it
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
get
that
lady

state
that

be
satisfied

and
fix
that
day
fortnight
as
the
period
for
my

the
post
of
governess
in
her
house

<EOS>
I
now
busy
myself
in
preparation
:
the
fortnight
pass
rapidly
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
very
large
wardrobe
,
though
it
be
adequate
to
my
want
;
and
the
last
day
suffice
to
pack
my
trunk
,
 
the
same
I
have
bring
with
me
eight
year
ago
from
Gateshead

<EOS>
the

in

whither
I

at
an

the
next
morning
to
meet
the

<EOS>
I
have
brush
my
black

prepare
my

seek
in
all
my

to
see
that
no
article
be
leave
behind
;
and
now
have
nothing
more
to
do
,
I
sit
down
and
try
to
rest
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
;
though
I
have
be
on
foot
all
day
,
I
could
not
now
repose
an
instant
;
I
be
too
much
excited

a
phase
of
my

be
close

night

a
new

opening

impossible

interval
;
I
must
watch
feverishly
while
the
change
be
be
accomplish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
,
"
say
a
servant
who
meet
me
in
the
lobby
,
where
I
be
wander
like
a
troubled
spirit
,
"
a
person
below
wish
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
carrier
,
no
doubt
,
"
I
think
,
and
run
downstairs
without
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
be
pass
the
back
-
parlour
or
teacher
'
sitting
-
room
,
the
door
of
which
be
half
open
,
to
go
to
the
kitchen
,
when
some
one
run
out
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
her
,
I
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
tell
her
anywhere
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
individual
who
stop
my
progress
and
take
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
:
<EOS>
I
see
a
woman
attire
like
a
well
-
dress
servant
,
matronly
,
yet
still
young
;
very
good
-
look
,
with
black
hair
and
eye
,
and
lively
complexion
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
who
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
in
a
voice
and
with
a
smile
I
half
recognise
;
"
you
have
not
quite
forget
me
,
I
think
,
Miss
Jane
?
"
  
<EOS>
in
another
second
I
be
embrace
and
kiss
her
rapturously
:
"
Bessie
!
<EOS>
Bessie
!
<EOS>
Bessie
!
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
I
say
;
whereat
she
half
laugh
,
half
cried
,
and
we
both
go
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
by
the
fire
stand
a
little
fellow
of
three
year
old
,
in
plaid
frock
and
trouser
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
little
boy
,
"
say
Bessie
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
married
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
nearly
five
year
since
to
Robert
Leaven
,
the
coachman
;
and
I
have
a
little
girl
besides
Bobby
there
,
that
I
have
christen
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
do
not
live
at
Gateshead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
live
at
the
lodge
:
the
old
porter
have
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
how
do
they
all
get
on
?
<EOS>
tell
me
everything
about
them
,
Bessie
:
but
sit
down
first
;
and
,
Bobby
,
come
and
sit
on
my
knee
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
but
Bobby
prefer
sidle
over
to
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
grow
so
very
tall
,
Miss
Jane
,
nor
so
very
stout
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Leaven
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
they
have
not
keep
you
too
well
at
school
:
Miss
Reed
be
the
head
and
shoulder
tall
than
you
be
;
and
Miss
Georgiana
would
make
two
of
you
in
breadth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Georgiana
be
handsome
,
I
suppose
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
.
<EOS>
She
go
up
to
London
last
winter
with
her
mama
,
and
there
everybody
admire
her
,
and
a
young
lord
fall
in
love
with
her
:
but
his
relation
be
against
the
match
;
and
 
what
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
he
and
Miss
Georgiana
make
it
up
to
run
away
;
but
they
be
find
out
and
stop
.
<EOS>
It
be
Miss
Reed
that
find
them
out
:
<EOS>
I
believe
she
be
envious
;
and
now
she
and
her
sister
lead
a
cat
and
dog
life
together
;
they
be
always
quarrel
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
what
of
John
Reed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
be
not
do
so
well
as
his
mama
could
wish
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
college
,
and
he
get
 
pluck
<EOS>
,
I
think
they
call
it
:
and
then
his
uncle
want
him
to
be
a
barrister
,
and
study
the
law
:
but
he
be
such
a
dissipate
young
man
<EOS>
,
they
will
never
make
much
of
him
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
look
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
tall
:
some
people
call
him
a
fine
-
look
young
man
;
but
he
have
such
thick
lip
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Reed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
missis
look
stout
and
well
enough
in
the
face
,
but
I
think
she
be
not
quite
easy
in
her
mind
:
<EOS>
Mr.
John
's
conduct
do
not
please
her
 
<EOS>
he
spend
a
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
send
you
here
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
:
but
I
have
long
want
to
see
you
,
and
when
I
hear
that
there
have
be
a
letter
from
you
,
and
that
you
be
go
to
another
part
of
the
country
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
would
just
set
off
,
and
get
a
look
at
you
before
you
be
quite
out
of
my
reach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
be
disappointed
in
me
,
Bessie
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
this
laughing
:
<EOS>
I
perceive
that
Bessie
's
glance
,
though
it
express
regard
,
do
in
no
shape
denote
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Miss
Jane
,
not
exactly
:
you
be
genteel
enough
;
you
look
like
a
lady
,
and
it
be
as
much
as
ever
<EOS>
I
expect
of
you
:
you
be
no
beauty
as
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
smile
at
Bessie
's
frank
answer
<EOS>
:
I
feel
that
it
be
correct
,
but
I
confess
I
be
not
quite
indifferent
to
its
import
:
<EOS>
at
eighteen
most
people
wish
to
please
,
and
the
conviction
that
they
have
not
an
exterior
likely
to
second
that
desire
bring
anything
but
gratification
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
be
clever
,
though
,
"
continue
Bessie
,
by
way
of
solace
.
<EOS>
"
what
can
you
do
?
<EOS>
Can
you
play
on
the
piano
?
"
  
"
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
in
the
room
;
Bessie
go
and
open
it
,
and
then
ask
me
to
sit
down
and
give
her
a
tune
:
I
play
a
waltz
or
two
,
and
she
be
charm
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Miss
Reeds
could
not
play
as
well
!
"
say
she
exultingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
say
you
would
surpass
them
in
learning
:
and
can
you
draw
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
one
of
my
painting
over
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
landscape
in
water
colour
,
of
which
I
have
make
a
present
to
the
superintendent
,
in
acknowledgment
of
her

mediation
with
the
committee
on

alone

you

French

yes

I
can
both

it

lady

I
know
you
would
be
:
you

get
on
whether
your

notice
you

not

<EOS>
there
be
something
I
want
to
ask
you

have
you
ever
hear
anything
from
your
father

kinsfolk

the
Eyres

<EOS>
"
  
"
never
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
know
Missis
always
say
they
be
poor
and
quite
despicable
:
and
they
may
be
poor
;
but
I
believe
they
be
as
much
gentry
as
the
reed
be
;
for
one
day
,
nearly
seven
year
ago
,
a
Mr.
Eyre
come
to
Gateshead
and
want
to
see
you
;
Missis
say
you
be
at
school
fifty
mile
off
;
he
seem
so
much
disappointed
,
for
he
could
not
stay
:
he
be
go
on
a
voyage
to
a
foreign
country
,
and
the
ship
be
to
sail
from
London
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
look
quite
a
gentleman
,
and
I
believe
he
be
your
father
's
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
foreign
country
be
he
go
to
,
Bessie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
an
island
thousand
of
mile
off
,
where
they
make
wine
 
<EOS>
the
butler
do
tell
me
 
"
  
"
madeira
?
"
<EOS>
I
suggest
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
that
is
it
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
very
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
he
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
do
not
stay
many
minute
in
the
house
:
missis
be
very
high
with
him
;
she
call
him
afterwards
a
"
sneak
tradesman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
Robert
believe
he
be
a
wine
-
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
likely
,
"
I
return
;
"
or
perhaps
clerk
or
agent
to
a
wine
-
merchant
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
and
I
converse
about
old
time
an
hour
longer
,
and
then
she
be
oblige
to
leave
me
<EOS>
:
I
see
her
again
for
a
few
minute
the
next
morning
at
Lowton
,
while
I
be
wait
for
the
coach
.
<EOS>
We
part
finally
at
the
door
of
the
Brocklehurst
Arms
there
:
each
go
her
separate
way
;
she
set
off
for
the
brow
of
Lowood
Fell
to
meet
the
conveyance
which
be
to
take
her
back
to
Gateshead
<EOS>
,
I
mount
the
vehicle
which
be
to
bear
me
to
new
duty
and
a
new
life
in
the
unknown
environ
of
Millcote
.
    
<EOS>
a
new
chapter
in
a
novel
be
something
like
a
new
scene
in
a
play
;
and
when
I
draw
up
the
curtain
this
time
,
reader
,
you
must
fancy
<EOS>
you
see
a
room
in
the
George
Inn
at
Millcote
,
with
such
large
figured
papering
on
the
wall
as
inn
room
have
;
such
a
carpet
,
such
furniture
,
such
ornament
on
the
mantelpiece
,
such
print
,
include
a
portrait
of
George
the
Third
,
and
another
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
and
a
representation
of
the
death
of
Wolfe
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
visible
to
you
by
the
light
of
an
oil
lamp
hang
from
the
ceiling
,
and
by
that
of
an
excellent
fire
,
near
which
I
sit
in
my
cloak
and
bonnet
;
my
muff
and
umbrella
lie
on
the
table
,
and
I
be
warm
away
the
numbness
and
chill
contract
by
sixteen
hour
'
exposure
to
the
rawness
of
an
October
day
:
I
leave
Lowton
at
four
o'clock
a.m.
,
and
the
Millcote
town
clock
be
now
just
strike
eight
.
  
<EOS>
reader
,
though
I
look
comfortably
accommodate
,
I
be
not
very
tranquil
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
think
when
the
coach
stop
here
there
would
be
some
one
to
meet
me
;
I
look
anxiously
round
as
I
descend
the
wooden
step
the
"
boot
"
place
for
my
convenience
,
expect
to
hear
my
name
pronounce
,
and
to
see
some
description
of
carriage
wait
to
convey
me
to
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
sort
be
visible
;
and
when
I
ask
a
waiter
if
any
one
have
be
to
inquire
after
a
Miss
Eyre
,
I
be
answer
in
the
negative
:
<EOS>
so
I
have
no
resource
but
<EOS>
to
request
to
be
show
into
a
private
room
:
<EOS>
and
here
I
be
wait
,
while
all
sort
of
doubt
and
fear
be
trouble
my
thought
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
strange
sensation
to
inexperienced
youth
to
feel
itself
quite
alone
in
the
world
,
cut
adrift
from
every
connection
,
uncertain
whether
the
port
to
which
it
be
bind
can
be
reach
,
and
prevent
by
many
impediment
from
return
to
that
it
have
quit
.
<EOS>
the
charm
of
adventure
sweeten
that
sensation
,
the
glow
of
pride
warm
it
;
but
then
the
throb
of
fear
disturb
it
;
and
fear
with
me
become
predominant
when
half
-
an
-
hour
elapse
and
still
I
be
alone
.
<EOS>
I
bethink
myself
to
ring
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
a
place
in
this
neighbourhood
call
Thornfield
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
of
the
waiter
who
answer
the
summon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thornfield
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
madam
;
I
will
inquire
at
the
bar
.
"
<EOS>
He
vanish
,
but
reappear
instantly
    
<EOS>
"
be
your
name
Eyre
,
Miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
person
here
wait
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
jump
up
,
take
my
muff
and
umbrella
,
and
hasten
into
the
inn
-
passage
:
a
man
be
stand
by
the
open
door
,
and
in
the
lamp
-
light
street
I
dimly
see
a
one
-
horse
conveyance
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
will
be
your
luggage
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
the
man
rather
abruptly
when
he
see
me
,
point
to
my
trunk
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
<EOS>
He
hoist
it
on
to
the
vehicle
,
which
be
a
sort
of
car
,
and
then
I
get
in
;
before
he
shut
me
up
,
I
ask
him
how
far
it
be
to
Thornfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
matter
of
six
mile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
shall
we
be
before
we
get
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
happen
an
hour
and
a
half
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
fasten
the
car
door
,
climb
to
his
own
seat
outside
,
and
we
set
off
.
<EOS>
Our
progress
be
leisurely
,
and
give
me
ample
time
to
reflect
;
I
be
content
to
be
at
length
so
near
the
end
of
my
journey
;
and
as
I
lean
back
in
the
comfortable
though
not
elegant
conveyance
,
I
meditate
much
at
my
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
think
I
,
"
judge
from
the
plainness
of
the
servant
and
carriage
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
be
not
a
very
dashing
person
:
so
much
the
well
;
I
never
live
amongst
fine
people
but
once
,
and
I
be
very
miserable
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
she
live
alone
except
this
little
girl
;
if
so
,
and
if
she
be
in
any
degree
amiable
,
I
shall
surely
be
able
to
get
on
with
her
;
I
will
do
my
good
;
it
be
a
pity
that
do
one
's
good
do
not
always
answer
.
<EOS>
at
Lowood
,
indeed
,
I
take
that
resolution
,
keep
it
,
and
succeed
in
pleasing
;
but
with
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
remember
my
good
be
always
spurn
with
scorn
.
<EOS>
I
pray
God
Mrs.
Fairfax
may
not
turn
out
a
second
Mrs.
Reed
;
but
if
she
do
,
I
be
not
bind
to
stay
with
her
!
<EOS>
let
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
I
can
advertise
again
.
<EOS>
how
far
be
we
on
our
road
now
,
I
wonder
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
let
down
the
window
and
look
out
;
Millcote
be
behind
us
;
judge
by
the
number
of
its
light
,
it
seem
a
place
of
considerable
magnitude
,
much
large
than
Lowton
.
<EOS>
We
be
now
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
on
a
sort
of
common
;
but
there
be
house
scatter
all
over
the
district
<EOS>
;
I
feel
we
be
in
a
different
region
to
Lowood
,
more
populous
,
less
picturesque
;
more
stirring
,
less
romantic
.
  
<EOS>
the
road
be
heavy
,
the
night
misty
;
my
conductor
let
his
horse
walk
all
the
way
,
and
the
hour
and
a
half
extended
,
I
verily
believe
,
to
two
hour
;
at
last
he
turn
in
his
seat
and
say
    
"
You
be
noan
so
far
fro
'
Thornfield
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
I
look
out
:
we
be
pass
a
church
;
I
see
its
low
broad
tower
against
the
sky
,
and
its
bell
be
toll
a
quarter
;
I
see
a
narrow
galaxy
of
light
too
,
on
a
hillside
,
mark
a
village
or
hamlet
.
<EOS>
about
ten
minute
after
,
the
driver
get
down
and
open
a
pair
of
gate
:
we
pass
through
,
and
they
clash
to
behind
us
.
<EOS>
We
now
slowly
ascend
a
drive
,
and
come
upon
the
long
front
of
a
house
:
<EOS>
candlelight
gleam
from
one
curtained
bow
-
window
;
all
the
rest
be
dark
.
<EOS>
the
car
stop
at
the
front
door
;
it
be
open
by
a
maid
-
servant
;
I
alight
and
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
walk
this
way
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
girl
;
and
I
follow
her
across
a
square
hall
with
high
door
all
round
:
she
usher
me
into
a
room
whose
double
illumination
of
fire
and
candle
at
first
dazzle
me
,
contrast
as
it
do
with
the
darkness
to
which
my
eye
have
be
for
two
hour
inure
;
when
I
could
see
,
however
,
a
cosy
and
agreeable
picture
present
itself
to
my
view
.
  
<EOS>
a
snug
small
room
;
a
round
table
by
a
cheerful
fire
;
an
arm
-
chair
high-
back
and
old
-
fashioned
,
wherein
sit
the
neat
imaginable
little
elderly
lady
,
in
widow
's
cap
,
black
silk
gown
,
and
snowy
muslin
apron
;
exactly
like
what
I
have
fancy
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
only
less
stately
and
milder
look
.
<EOS>
She
be
occupy
in
knitting
;
a
large
cat
sit
demurely
at
her
foot
;
nothing
in
short
be
want
to
complete
the
beau
-
ideal
of
domestic
comfort
.
<EOS>
a
more
reassuring
introduction
for
a
new
governess
could
scarcely
be
conceive
;
there
be
no
grandeur
to
overwhelm
,
no
stateliness
to
embarrass
;
and
then
,
as
I
enter
,
the
old
lady
get
up
and
promptly
and
kindly
come
forward
to
meet
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
you
have
have
a
tedious
ride
;
John
drive
so
slowly
;
you
must
be
cold
,
come
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
you
be
right
:
do
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
conduct
me
to
her
own
chair
,
and
then
begin
to
remove
my
shawl
and
untie
my
bonnet
-
string
;
I
beg
she
would
not
give
herself
so
much
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
no
trouble
;
I
dare
say
your
own
hand
be
almost
numbed
with
cold
.
<EOS>
Leah
,
make
a
little
hot
negus
and
cut
a
sandwich
or
two
:
here
be
the
key
of
the
storeroom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
she
produce
from
her
pocket
a
most
housewifely
bunch
of
key
,
and
deliver
them
to
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
then
,
draw
nearer
to
the
fire
,
"
she
continue
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
bring
your
luggage
with
you
,
have
not
you
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
.
"
  
"
I
will
see
it
carry
into
your
room
,
"
she
say
,
and
bustle
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
treat
me
like
a
visitor
,
"
think
i.
"
<EOS>
I
little
expect
such
a
reception
;
I
anticipate
only
coldness
and
stiffness
:
this
be
not
like
what
I
have
hear
of
the
treatment
of
governess
;
but
I
must
not
exult
too
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
return
;
with
her
own
hand
clear
her
knit
apparatus
and
a
book
or
two
from
the
table
,
to
make
room
for
the
tray
which
Leah
now
bring
,
and
then
herself
hand
me
the
refreshment
.
<EOS>
I
feel
rather
confused
at
be
the
object
of
more
attention
than
I
have
ever
before
receive
,
and
,
that
too
,
show
by
my
employer
and
superior
;
but
as
she
do
not
herself
seem
to
consider
she
be
do
anything
out
of
her
place
,
I
think
it
better
to
take
her
civility
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
Miss
Fairfax
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
when
I
have
partake
of
what
she
offer
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
deaf
,
"
return
the
good
lady
,
approach
her
ear
to
my
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
question
more
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
oh
,
you
mean
Miss
Varens
<EOS>
!
<EOS>
Varens
be
the
name
of
your
future
pupil
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
then
she
be
not
your
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
 
I
have
no
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
follow
up
my
first
inquiry
,
by
ask
in
what
way
Miss
Varens
be
connect
with
her
;
but
I
recollect
it
be
not
polite
to
ask
too
many
question
:
besides
,
I
be
sure
to
hear
in
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
,
"
she
continue
,
as
she
sit
down
opposite
to
me
,
and
take
the
cat
on
her
knee
;
"
I
be
so
glad
you
be
come
;
it
will
be
quite
pleasant
live
here
now
with
a
companion
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
be
pleasant
at
any
time
;
for
Thornfield
be
a
fine
old
hall
,
rather
neglect
of
late
year
perhaps
,
but
still
it
be
a
respectable
place
;
yet
you
know
in
winter
-
time
one
feel
dreary
quite
alone
in
the
good
quarter
.
<EOS>
I
say
alone
 
<EOS>
Leah
be
a
nice
girl
to
be
sure
,
and
John
and
his
wife
be
very
decent
people
;
but
then
you
see
they
be
only
servant
,
and
one
can
not
converse
with
them
on
term
of
equality
:
one
must
keep
them
at
due
distance
,
for
fear
of
lose
one
's
authority
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
last
winter
(
it
be
a
very
severe
one
,
if
you
recollect
,
and
when
it
do
not
snow
,
it
rain
and
blow
)
,
<EOS>
not
a
creature
but
the
butcher
and
postman
come
to
the
house
,
from
November
till
February
;
and
I
really
get
quite
melancholy
with
sit
night
after
night
alone
<EOS>
;
I
have
Leah
in
to
read
to
me
sometimes
;
but
I
do
not
think
the
poor
girl
like
the
task
much
:
she
feel
it
confine
.
<EOS>
in
spring
and
summer
one
get
on
better
:
<EOS>
sunshine
and
long
day
make
such
a
difference
;
and
then
,
just
at
the
commencement
of
this
autumn
,
little
Adela
Varens
come
and
her
nurse
<EOS>
:
a
child
make
a
house
alive
all
at
once
;
and
now
you
be
here
<EOS>
I
shall
be
quite
gay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
really
warm
to
the
worthy
lady
as
I
hear
her
talk
;
and
I
draw
my
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
,
and
express
my
sincere
wish
that
she
may
find
my
company
as
agreeable
as
she
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
not
keep
you
sit
up
late
to
-
night
,
"
say
she
;
"
it
be
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
now
,
and
you
have
be
travel
all
day
:
you
must
feel
tired
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
get
your
foot
well
warm
,
I
will
show
you
your
bedroom
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
the
room
next
to
mine
prepared
for
you
;
it
be
only
a
small
apartment
,
but
I
think
you
would
like
it
better
than
one
of
the
large
front
chamber
:
to
be
sure
they
have
fine
furniture
,
but
they
be
so
dreary
and
solitary
,
I
never
sleep
in
them
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thank
her
for
her
considerate
choice
,
and
as
I
really
feel
fatigued
with
my
long
journey
,
express
my
readiness
to
retire
.
<EOS>
She
take
her
candle
,
and
I
follow
her
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
first
she
go
to
see
if
the
hall
-
door
be
fasten
;
have
take
the
key
from
the
lock
,
she
lead
the
way
upstairs
.
<EOS>
the
step
and
banister
be
of
oak
;
the
staircase
window
be
high
and
lattice
;
both
it
and
the
long
gallery
into
which
the
bedroom
door
open
look
as
if
they
belong
to
a
church
rather
than
a
house
.
<EOS>
a
very
chill
and
vault
-
like
air
pervade
the
stair
and
gallery
,
suggest
cheerless
idea
of
space
and
solitude
;
and
I
be
glad
,
when
finally
usher
into
my
chamber
,
to
find
it
of
small
dimension
,
and
furnish
in
ordinary
,
modern
style
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
bid
me
a
kind
good
-
night
,
and
I
have
fasten
my
door
,
gaze
leisurely
round
,
and
in
some
measure
efface
the
eerie
impression
make
by
that
wide
hall
,
that
dark
and
spacious
staircase
,
and
that
long
,
cold
gallery
,
by
the
lively
aspect
of
my
little
room
<EOS>
,
I
remember
that
,
after
a
day
of
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
anxiety
,
I
be
now
at
last
in
safe
haven
.
<EOS>
the
impulse
of
gratitude
swell
my
heart
,
and
I
knelt
down
at
the
bedside
,
and
offer
up
thank
where
thank
be
due
;
not
forget
,
ere
I
rise
,
to
implore
aid
on
my
further
path
,
and
the
power
of
merit
the
kindness
which
seem
so
frankly
offer
me
before
it
be
earn
.
<EOS>
My
couch
have
no
thorn
in
it
that
night
;
my
solitary
room
no
fear
.
<EOS>
at
once
weary
and
content
,
I
sleep
soon
and
soundly
:
when
I
awake
it
be
broad
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
chamber
look
such
a
bright
little
place
to
me
as
the
sun
shine
in
between
the
gay
blue
chintz
window
curtain
,
show
papered
wall
and
a
carpet
floor
,
so
unlike
the
bare
plank
and
stain
plaster
of
Lowood
,
that
my
spirit
rise
at
the
view
.
<EOS>
external
have
a
great
effect
on
the
young
:
I
think
that
a
fairer
era
of
life
be
begin
for
me
,
one
that
be
to
have
its
flower
and
pleasure
,
as
well
as
its
thorn
and
toil
.
<EOS>
My
faculty
,
rouse
by
the
change
of
scene
,
the
new
field
offer
to
hope
,
seem
all
astir
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
precisely
define
what
they
expect
,
but
it
be
something
pleasant
:
not
perhaps
that
day
or
that
month
,
but
at
an
indefinite
future
period
.
  
<EOS>
I
rise
;
I
dress
myself
with
care
:
oblige
to
be
plain
 
for
I
have
no
article
of
attire
that
be
not
make
with
extreme
simplicity
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
by
nature
solicitous
to
be
neat
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
habit
to
be
disregardful
of
appearance
or
careless
of
the
impression
I
make
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
ever
wish
to
look
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
to
please
as
much
as
my
want
of
beauty
would
permit
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
regret
that
I
be
not
handsome
;
I
sometimes
wish
to
have
rosy
cheek
,
a
straight
nose
,
and
small
cherry
mouth
;
I
desire
to
be
tall
,
stately
,
and
finely
develop
in
figure
;
I
feel
it
a
misfortune
that
I
be
so
little
,
so
pale
,
and
have
feature
so
irregular
and
so
marked
.
<EOS>
and
why
have
I
these
aspiration
and
these
regret
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
:
I
could
not
then
distinctly
say
it
to
myself
;
yet
I
have
a
reason
,
and
a
logical
,
natural
reason
too
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
I
have
brush
my
hair
very
smooth
,
and
put
on
my
black
frock
 
which
,
Quakerlike
as
it
be
,
at
least
have
the
merit
of
fit
to
a
nicety
 
and
adjust
my
clean
white
tucker
,
I
think
I
should
do
respectably
enough
to
appear
before
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
that
my
new
pupil
would
not
at
least
recoil
from
me
with
antipathy
.
<EOS>
have
open
my
chamber
window
,
and
see
that
I
leave
all
thing
straight
and
neat
on
the
toilet
table
,
I
venture
forth
.
  
<EOS>
traverse
the
long
and
matted
gallery
,
I
descend
the
slippery
step
of
oak
;
then
I
gain
the
hall
:
I
halt
there
a
minute
;
I
look
at
some
picture
on
the
wall
(
one
,
I
remember
,
represent
a
grim
man
in
a
cuirass
,
and
one
a
lady
with
powdered
hair
and
a
pearl
necklace
)
,
at
a
bronze
lamp
pendent
from
the
ceiling
,
at
a
great
clock
whose
case
be
of
oak
curiously
carve
,
and
ebon
black
with
time
and
rubbing
.
<EOS>
everything
appear
very
stately
and
impose
to
me
;
but
then
I
be
so
little
accustomed
to
grandeur
.
<EOS>
the
hall
-
door
,
which
be
half
of
glass
,
stand
open
;
I
step
over
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
autumn
morning
;
the
early
sun
shine
serenely
on
embrowned
grove
and
still
green
field
;
advance
on
to
the
lawn
,
I
look
up
and
survey
the
front
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
be
three
storey
high
,
of
proportion
not
vast
,
though
considerable
:
a
gentleman
's
manor
-
house
,
not
a
nobleman
's
seat
:
battlement
round
the
top
give
it
a
picturesque
look
.
<EOS>
Its
grey
front
stand
out
well
from
the
background
of
a
rookery
,
whose
cawing
tenant
be
now
on
the
wing
:
they
fly
over
the
lawn
and
ground
to
alight
in
a
great
meadow
,
from
which
these
be
separate
by
a
sink
fence
,
and
where
an
array
of
mighty
old
thorn
tree
,
strong
,
knotty
,
and
broad
as
oak
,
at
once
explain
the
etymology
of
the
mansion
's
designation
.
<EOS>
farther
off
be
hill
:
not
so
lofty
as
those
round
Lowood
,
nor
so
craggy
,
nor
so
like
barrier
of
separation
from
the
live
world
;
but
yet
quiet
and
lonely
hill
enough
,
and
seem
to
embrace
Thornfield
with
a
seclusion
I
have
not
expect
to
find
existent
so
near
the
stirring
locality
of
Millcote
.
<EOS>
a
little
hamlet
,
whose
roof
be
blent
with
tree
,
straggle
up
the
side
of
one
of
these
hill
;
the
church
of
the
district
stand
nearer
Thornfield
:
<EOS>
its
old
tower
-
top
look
over
a
knoll
between
the
house
and
gate
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
yet
enjoy
the
calm
prospect
and
pleasant
fresh
air
,
yet
listen
with
delight
to
the
cawing
of
the
rook
,
yet
survey
the
wide
,
hoary
front
of
the
hall
,
and
think
what
a
great
place
it
be
for
one
lonely
little
dame
like
Mrs.
Fairfax
to
inhabit
,
when
that
lady
appear
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
out
already
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
be
an
early
riser
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
up
to
her
,
and
be
receive
with
an
affable
kiss
and
shake
of
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
like
Thornfield
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
like
it
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
"
it
be
a
pretty
place
;
but
I
fear
it
will
be
get
out
of
order
,
unless
Mr.
Rochester
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
and
reside
here
permanently
;
or
,
at
least
,
visit
it
rather
oftener
:
<EOS>
great
house
and
fine
ground
require
the
presence
of
the
proprietor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
owner
of
Thornfield
,
"
she
respond
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
not
know
he
be
call
Rochester
?
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
do
not
 
I
have
never
hear
of
him
before
;
but
the
old
lady
seem
to
regard
his
existence
as
a
universally
understand
fact
,
with
which
everybody
must
be
acquaint
by
instinct
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
I
continue
,
"
Thornfield
belong
to
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
me
?
<EOS>
bless
you
,
child
;
what
an
idea
!
<EOS>
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
be
only
the
housekeeper
 
the
manager
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
be
distantly
related
to
the
Rochesters
by
the
mother
's
side
,
or
at
least
my
husband
be
;
he
be
a
clergyman
,
incumbent
of
Hay
 
that
little
village
yonder
on
the
hill
 
and
that
church
near
the
gate
be
his
.
<EOS>
the
present
Mr.
Rochester
's
mother
be
a
Fairfax
,
and
second
cousin
to
my
husband
:
<EOS>
but
I
never
presume
on
the
connection
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
nothing
to
me
;
I
consider
myself
quite
in
the
light
of
an
ordinary
housekeeper
:
my
employer
be
always
civil
,
and
I
expect
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
little
girl
 
<EOS>
my
pupil
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
Mr.
Rochester
's
ward
;
he
commission
me
to
find
a
governess
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
have
her
bring
up
in
shire
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
here
she
come
,
with
her
"
bonne
,
"
as
she
call
her
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
enigma
then
be
explain
:
this
affable
and
kind
little
widow
be
no
great
dame
;
but
a
dependant
like
myself
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
her
the
bad
for
that
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
feel
better
pleased
than
ever
.
<EOS>
the
equality
between
her
and
me
be
real
;
not
the
mere
result
of
condescension
on
her
part
:
so
much
the
well
 
<EOS>
my
position
be
all
the
free
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
meditate
on
this
discovery
,
a
little
girl
,
follow
by
her
attendant
,
come
run
up
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
pupil
,
who
do
not
at
first
appear
to
notice
me
:
she
be
quite
a
child
,
perhaps
seven
or
eight
year
old
,
slightly
build
,
with
a
pale
,
small
-
featured
face
,
and
a
redundancy
of
hair
fall
in
curl
to
her
waist
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
morning
,
Miss
Adela
,
"
say
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
come
and
speak
to
the
lady
who
be
to
teach
you
,
and
to
make
you
a
clever
woman
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
She
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
c'est
la
ma
gouverante
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
point
to
me
,
and
address
her
nurse
;
who
answer
    
"
Mais
oui
,
certainement
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
they
foreigner
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
amazed
at
hear
the
french
language
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
nurse
be
a
foreigner
,
and
Adela
be
bear
on
the
continent
;
and
,
I
believe
,
never
leave
it
till
within
six
month
ago
.
<EOS>
when
she
first
come
here
she
could
speak
no
English
;
now
she
can
make
shift
to
talk
it
a
little
:
I
do
not
understand
her
,
she
mix
it
so
with
French
;
but
you
will
make
out
her
meaning
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
fortunately
I
have
have
the
advantage
of
be
teach
French
by
a
french
lady
;
and
as
I
have
always
make
a
point
of
converse
with
Madame
Pierrot
as
often
as
I
could
,
and
have
besides
,
during
the
last
seven
year
,
learn
a
portion
of
French
by
heart
daily
 
apply
myself
to
take
pain
with
my
accent
,
and
imitate
as
closely
as
possible
the
pronunciation
of
my
teacher
,
I
have
acquire
a
certain
degree
of
readiness
and
correctness
in
the
language
,
and
be
not
likely
to
be
much
at
a
loss
with
Mademoiselle
Adela
.
<EOS>
She
come
and
shake
hand
with
me
when
she
hear
that
I
be
her
governess
;
and
as
I
lead
her
in
to
breakfast
,
I
address
some
phrase
to
her
in
her
own
tongue
<EOS>
:
she
reply
briefly
at
first
,
but
after
we
be
seat
at
the
table
,
and
she
have
examine
me
some
ten
minute
with
her
large
hazel
eye
,
she
suddenly
commence
chatter
fluently
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
cry
she
,
in
French
,
"
you
speak
my
language
as
well
as
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
do
:
I
can
talk
to
you
as
I
can
to
him
,
and
so
can
Sophie
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
glad
<EOS>
:
nobody
here
understand
her
:
<EOS>
Madame
Fairfax
be
all
English
.
<EOS>
Sophie
be
my
nurse
;
she
come
with
me
over
the
sea
in
a
great
ship
with
a
chimney
that
smoke
 
how
it
do
smoke
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sick
,
and
so
be
Sophie
,
and
so
be
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
lie
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
pretty
room
call
the
salon
,
and
Sophie
<EOS>
and
I
have
little
bed
in
another
place
.
<EOS>
I
nearly
fall
out
of
mine
;
it
be
like
a
shelf
.
<EOS>
and
Mademoiselle
 
what
be
your
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eyre
 
Jane
Eyre

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aire

<EOS>
bah
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
our
ship
stop
in
the
morning
,
before
it
be
quite
daylight
,
at
a
great
city
 
a
huge
city
,
with
very
dark
house
and
all
smoky
;
not
at
all
like
the
pretty
clean
town
I
come
from
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
carry
me
in
his
arm
over
a
plank
to
the
land
,
and
Sophie
come
after
,
and
we
all
get
into
a
coach
,
which
take
us
to
a
beautiful
large
house
,
large
than
this
and
fine
,
call
an
hotel
.
<EOS>
We
stay
there
nearly
a
week
:
I
and
Sophie
use
to
walk
every
day
in
a
great
green
place
full
of
tree
,
call
the
Park
;
and
there
be
many
child
there
besides
me
,
and
a
pond
with
beautiful
bird
in
it
,
that
I
feed
with
crumb
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
understand
her
when
she
run
on
so
fast
?
"
ask
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
  
<EOS>
I
understand
her
very
well
,
for
I
have
be
accustom
to
the
fluent
tongue
of
Madame
Pierrot
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
continue
the
good
lady
,
"
you
would
ask
her
a
question
or
two
about
her
parent
:
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
she
remember
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adele
,
"
I
inquire
,
"
with
whom
do
you
live
when
you
be
in
that
pretty
clean
town
you
speak
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
live
long
ago
with
mama
;
but
she
be
go
to
the
Holy
Virgin
.
<EOS>
Mama
use
to
teach
me
to
dance
and
sing
,
and
to
say
verse
.
<EOS>
a
great
many
gentleman
and
lady
come
to
see
mama
,
and
I
use
to
dance
before
them
,
or
to
sit
on
their
knee
and
sing
to
them
:
<EOS>
I
like
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
let
you
hear
me
sing
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
finish
her
breakfast
,
so
I
permit
her
to
give
a
speciman
of
her
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
descend
from
her
chair
,
she
come
and
place
herself
on
my
knee
;
then
,
fold
her
little
hand
demurely
before
her
,
shake
back
her
curl
and
lift
her
eye
to
the
ceiling
,
she
commence
singe
a
song
from
some
opera
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
strain
of
a
forsaken
lady
,
who
,
after
bewail
the
perfidy
of
her
lover
,
call
pride
to
her
aid
;
desire
her
attendant
to
deck
her
in
her
bright
jewel
and
rich
robe
,
and
resolve
to
meet
the
false
one
that
night
at
a
ball
,
and
prove
to
him
,
by
the
gaiety
of
her
demeanour
,
how
little
his
desertion
have
affect
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
seem
strangely
choose
for
an
infant
singer
;
but
I
suppose
the
point
of
the
exhibition
lie
in
hear
the
note
of
love
and
jealousy
warble
with
the
lisp
of
childhood
;
and
in
very
bad
taste
that
point
be
:
at
least
I
think
so
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
sing
the
canzonette
tunefully
enough
,
and
with
the
_
naivete
_
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
this
achieve
,
she
jump
from
my
knee
and
say
,
"
now
,
Mademoiselle
,
I
will
repeat
you
some
poetry
.
"
  
<EOS>
assume
an
attitude
,
she
begin
,
"
La
Ligue
des
rat
:
fable
de
La
Fontaine
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
declaim
the
little
piece
with
an
attention
to
punctuation
and
emphasis
,
a
flexibility
of
voice
and
an
appropriateness
of
gesture
,
very
unusual
indeed
at
her
age
,
and
which
prove
she
have
be
carefully
train
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
your
mama
who
teach
you
that
piece
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
she
just
use
to
say
it
in
this
way
:
"
Qu
'
avez
vous
donc
?
<EOS>
lui
dit
un
de
ces
rat
;
parlez
!
"
<EOS>
She
make
me
lift
my
hand
 
<EOS>
so
 
to
remind
me
to
raise
my
voice
at
the
question
.
<EOS>
now
shall
I
dance
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
that
will
do
:
but
after
your
mama
go
to
the
Holy
Virgin
,
as
you
say
,
with
whom
do
you
live
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
with
Madame
Frederic
and
her
husband
:
she
take
care
of
me
,
but
she
be
nothing
related
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
be
poor
,
for
she
have
not
so
fine
a
house
as
mama
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
long
there
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
ask
me
if
I
would
like
to
go
and
live
with
him
in
England
,
and
I
say
yes
;
for
I
know
Mr.
Rochester
before
I
know
Madame
Frederic
,
and
he
be
always
kind
to
me
and
give
me
pretty
dress
and
toy
:
<EOS>
but
you
see
he
have
not
keep
his
word
,
for
he
have
bring
me
to
England
,
and
now
he
be
go
back
again
himself
,
and
I
never
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
Adele
and
I
withdraw
to
the
library
,
which
room
<EOS>
,
it
appear
,
Mr.
Rochester
have
direct
should
be
use
as
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
book
be
lock
up
behind
glass
door
;
but
there
be
one
bookcase
leave
open
contain
everything
that
could
be
need
in
the
way
of
elementary
work
,
and
several
volume
of
light
literature
,
poetry
,
biography
,
travel
,
a
few
romance
,
&
<EOS>
c.
I
suppose
he
have
consider
that
these
be
all
the
governess
would
require
for
her
private
perusal
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
content
me
amply
for
the
present
;
compare
with
the
scanty
picking
I
have
now
and
then
be
able
to
glean
at
Lowood
,
they
seem
to
offer
an
abundant
harvest
of
entertainment
and
information
.
<EOS>
in
this
room
,
too
,
there
be
a
cabinet
piano
,
quite
new
and
of
superior
tone
;
also
an
easel
for
painting
and
a
pair
of
globe
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
my
pupil
sufficiently
docile
,
though
disincline
to
apply
:
she
have
not
be
use
to
regular
occupation
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
would
be
injudicious
to
confine
her
too
much
at
first
;
so
,
when
I
have
talk
to
her
a
great
deal
,
and
get
her
to
learn
a
little
,
and
when
the
morning
have
advance
to
noon
,
I
allow
her
to
return
to
her
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
then
propose
to
occupy
myself
till
dinner
-
time
in
draw
some
little
sketch
for
her
use
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
go
upstairs
to
fetch
my
portfolio
and
pencil
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
call
to
me
:
"
Your
morning
school
-
hour
be
over
now
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
room
the
fold
-
door
of
which
stand
open
:
I
go
in
when
she
address
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large

stately
apartment
,
with
purple
chair
and
curtain
,
a
Turkey
carpet
,
walnut
-
panel
wall
,
one
vast
window
rich
in
slanted
glass
,
and
a
lofty
ceiling
,
nobly
mould
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
be
dust
some
vase
of
fine
purple
spar
,
which
stand
on
a
sideboard
.

a
beautiful
room
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
as
I
look
round
;
for
I
have
never
before
see
any
half
so
impose
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
this
be
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
open
the
window
,
to
let
in
a
little
air
and
sunshine
;
for
everything
get
so
damp
in
apartment
that
be
seldom
inhabit
;
the
drawing
-
room
yonder
feel
like
a
vault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
point
to
a
wide
arch
correspond
to
the
window
,
and
hang
like
it
with
a
tyrian
-
dyed
curtain
,
now
loop
up
.
<EOS>
mount
to
it
by
two
broad
step
,
and
look
through
,
I
think
I
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
fairy
place
,
so
bright
to
my
novice
-
eye
<EOS>
appear
the
view
beyond
.
<EOS>
yet
it
be
merely
a
very
pretty
drawing
-
room
,
and
within
it
a
boudoir
<EOS>
,
both
spread
with
white
carpet
,
on
which
seem
lay
brilliant
garland
of
flower
;
both
ceile
with
snowy
moulding
of
white
grape
and
vine
-
leave
,
beneath
which
glow
in
rich
contrast
crimson
couch
and
ottomans
;
while
the
ornament
on
the
pale
parian
mantelpiece
be
of
sparkle
bohemian
glass
,
ruby
red
;
and
between
the
window
large
mirror
repeat
the
general
blending
of
snow
and
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
order
you
keep
these
room
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
no
dust
,
no
canvas
covering
:
except
that
the
air
feel
chilly
,
one
would
think
they
be
inhabit
daily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Miss
Eyre
,
though
Mr.
Rochester
's
visit
here
be
rare
,
they
be
always
sudden
and
unexpected
;
and
as
I
observe
that
it
put
him
out
to
find
everything
swathe
up
,
and
to
have
a
bustle
of
arrangement
on
his
arrival
,
I
think
it
best
to
keep
the
room
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Rochester
an
exacting
,
fastidious
sort
of
man
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
particularly
so
<EOS>
;
but
he
have
a
gentleman
's
taste
and
habit
,
and
he
expect
to
have
thing
manage
in
conformity
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
like
him
?
<EOS>
be
he
generally
like
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
the
family
have
always
be
respect
here
.
<EOS>
almost
all
the
land
in
this
neighbourhood
,
as
far
as
you
can
see
,
have
belong
to
the
Rochesters
time
out
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
leave
his
land
out
of
the
question
,
do
you
like
him
?
<EOS>
be
he
like
for
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
cause
to
do
otherwise
than
like
him
;
and
I
believe
he
be
consider
a
just
and
liberal
landlord
by
his
tenant
:
but
he
have
never
live
much
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
have
he
no
peculiarity
?
<EOS>
what
,
in
short
,
be
his
character
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
his
character
be
unimpeachable
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
peculiar
,
perhaps
:
he
have
travel
a
great
deal
,
and
see
a
great
deal
of
the
world
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
be
clever
,
but
I
never
have
much
conversation
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
way
be
he
peculiar
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
easy
to
describe
 
nothing
striking
,
but
you
feel
it
when
he
speak
to
you
;
you
can
not
be
always
sure
whether
he
be
in
jest
or
earnest
,
whether
he
be
pleased
or
the
contrary
;
you
do
not
thoroughly
understand
him
,
in
short
 
at
least
,
I
do
not
:
but
it
be
of
no
consequence
<EOS>
,
he
be
a
very
good
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
the
account
I
get
from
Mrs.
Fairfax
of
her
employer
and
mine
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
who
seem
to
have
no
notion
of
sketch
a
character
,
or
observe
and
describe
salient
point
,
either
in
person
or
thing
:
the
good
lady
evidently
belong
to
this
class
;
my
query
puzzle
,
but
do
not
draw
her
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
be
Mr.
Rochester
in
her
eye
;
a
gentleman
,
a
landed
proprietor
 
nothing
more
:
she
inquire
and
search
no
further
,
and
evidently
wonder
at
my
wish
to
gain
a
more
definite
notion
of
his
identity
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
leave
the
dining
-
room
,
she
propose
to
show
me
over
the
rest
of
the
house
;
and
I
follow
her
upstairs
and
downstair
,
admire
as
I
go
;
for
all
be
well
arrange
and
handsome
.
<EOS>
the
large
front
chamber
I
think
especially
grand
:
and
some
of
the
third
-
storey
room
,
though
dark
and
low
,
be
interesting
from
their
air
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
once
appropriate
to
the
low
apartment
have
from
time
to
time
be
remove
here
,
as
fashion
change
:
and
the
imperfect
light
enter
by
their
narrow
casement
show
bedstead
of
a
hundred
year
old
;
chest
in
oak
or
walnut
,
look
,
with
their
strange
carving
of
palm
branch
and
cherub
'
head
,
like
type
of
the
Hebrew
ark
;
<EOS>
row
of
venerable
chair
,
high
-
backed
and
narrow
;
stool
still
more
antiquated
,
on
whose
cushion
top
be
yet
apparent
trace
of
half
-
efface
embroidery
,
work
by
finger
that
for
two
generation
have
be
coffin
-
dust
.
<EOS>
all
these
relic
give
to
the
third
storey
of
Thornfield
Hall
the
aspect
of
a
home
of
the
past
:
a
shrine
of
memory
.
<EOS>
I
like
the
hush
,
the
gloom
,
the
quaintness
of
these
retreat
in
the
day
;
but
I
by
no
means
covet
a
night
's
repose
on
one
of
those
wide
and
heavy
bed
:
shut
in
,
some
of
them
,
with
door
of
oak
;
shade
,
other
,
with
work
old
english
hanging
crust
with
thick
work
,
portray
effigy
of
strange
flower
,
and
strange
bird
,
and
strange
human
being
,
 
all
which
would
have
look
strange
,
indeed
,
by
the
pallid
gleam
of
moonlight
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
the
servant
sleep
in
these
room
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
they
occupy
a
range
of
small
apartment
to
the
back
;
no
one
ever
sleep
here
:
one
would
almost
say
that
,
if
there
be
a
ghost
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
this
would
be
its
haunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
think
:
<EOS>
you
have
no
ghost
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
that
I
ever
hear
of
,
"
return
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
any
tradition
of
one
?
<EOS>
no
legend
or
ghost
story
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
say
the
Rochesters
have
be
rather
a
violent
than
a
quiet
race
in
their
time
:
perhaps
,
though
,
that
be
the
reason
they
rest
tranquilly
in
their
grave
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
 
"
after
life
's
fitful
fever
they
sleep
well
,
"
"
I
mutter
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
now
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
"
<EOS>
for
she
be
move
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
to
the
lead
;
will
you
come
and
see
the
view
from
thence
?
<EOS>
"
I
follow
still
,
up
a
very
narrow
staircase
to
the
attic
,
and
thence
by
a
ladder
and
through
a
trap
-
door
to
the
roof
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
on
a
level
with
the
crow
colony
,
and
could
see
into
their
nest
.
<EOS>
lean
over
the
battlement
and
look
far
down
,
I
survey
the
ground
lay
out
like
a
map
:
the
bright
and
velvet
lawn
closely
girdle
the
grey
base
of
the
mansion
;
the
field
,
wide
as
a
park
,
dot
with
its
ancient
timber
;
the
wood
,
dun
and
sere
,
divide
by
a
path
visibly
overgrow
,
greener
with
moss
than
the
tree
be
with
foliage
;
the
church
at
the
gate
,
the
road
,
the
tranquil
hill
,
all
repose
in
the
autumn
day
's
sun
;
the
horizon
bound
by
a
propitious
sky
,
azure
,
marble
with
pearly
white
.
<EOS>
no
feature
in
the
scene
be
extraordinary
,
but
all
be
pleasing
.
<EOS>
when
I
turn
from
it
and
repasse
the
trap
-
door
,
I
could
scarcely
see
my
way
down
the
ladder
;
the
attic
seem
black
as
a
vault
compare
with
that
arch
of
blue
air
to
which
I
have
be
look
up
,
and
to
that
sunlit
scene
of
grove
,
pasture
,
and
green
hill
,
of
which
the
hall
be
the
centre
,
and
over
which
I
have
be
gaze
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
stay
behind
a
moment
to
fasten
the
trap
-
door
;
I
,
by
drift
of
grope
,
find
the
outlet
from
the
attic
,
and
proceed
to
descend
the
narrow
garret
staircase
.
<EOS>
I
linger
in
the
long
passage
to
which
this
lead
,
separate
the
front
and
back
room
of
the
third
storey
:
narrow
,
low
,
and
dim
,
with
only
one
little
window
at
the
far
end
,
and
look
,
with
its
two
row
of
small
black
door
all
shut
,
like
a
corridor
in
some
Bluebeard
's
castle
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
pace
softly
on
,
the
last
sound
I
expect
to
hear
in
so
still
a
region
,
a
laugh
,
strike
my
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
curious
laugh
;
distinct
,
formal
,
mirthless
.
<EOS>
I
stop
:
the
sound
cease
,
only
for
an
instant
;
it
begin
again
,
louder
:
for
at
first
,
though
distinct
,
it
be
very
low
.
<EOS>
It
pass
off
in
a
clamorous
peal
that
seem
to
wake
an
echo
in
every
lonely
chamber
;
though
it
originate
but
in
one
,
and
I
could
have
point
out
the
door
whence
the
accent
issue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
"
I
call
out
:
for
I
now
hear
her
descend
the
great
stair
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
that
loud
laugh
?
<EOS>
who
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
some
of
the
servant
,
very
likely
,
"
she
answer
:
"
perhaps
Grace
Poole
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
again
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
plainly
:
I
often
hear
her
:
she
sew
in
one
of
these
room
.
<EOS>
sometimes
Leah
be
with
her
;
they
be
frequently
noisy
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
laugh
be
repeat
in
its
low
,
syllabic
tone
,
and
terminate
in
an
odd
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
"
grace
!
"
exclaim
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
  
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
expect
any
grace
to
answer
;
for
the
laugh
be
as
tragic
,
as
preternatural
a
laugh
as
any
I
ever
hear
;
and
,
but
that
it
be
high
noon
,
and
that
no
circumstance
of
ghostliness
accompany
the
curious
cachinnation
;
but
that
neither
scene
nor
season
favour
fear
,
I
should
have
be
superstitiously
afraid
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
event
show
me
I
be
a
fool
for
entertain
a
sense
even
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
near
me
open
,
and
a
servant
come
out
,
 
a
woman
of
between
thirty
and
forty
;
a
set
,
square
-
make
figure
,
red
-
haired
,
and
with
a
hard
,
plain
face
:
any
apparition
less
romantic
or
less
ghostly
could
scarcely
be
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
"
too
much
noise
,
grace
,
"
say
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
remember
direction
!
"
<EOS>
grace
curtsey
silently
and
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
person
we
have
to
sew
and
assist
Leah
in
her
housemaid
's
work
,
"
continue
the
widow
;
"
not
altogether
unobjectionable
in
some
point
,
but
she
do
well
enough
.
<EOS>
by
-
the
-
bye
<EOS>
,
how
have
you
get
on
with
your
new
pupil
this
morning
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
,
thus
turn
on
Adele
,
continue
till
we
reach
the
light
and
cheerful
region
below
.
<EOS>
Adele
come
run
to
meet
us
in
the
hall
,
exclaim
    
"
Mesdames
,
vous
ete
servie
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
add
,
"
J'ai
bien
faim
,
moi
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
find
dinner
ready
,
and
wait
for
us
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.
    
<EOS>
the
promise
of
a
smooth
career
,
which
my
first
calm
introduction
to
Thornfield
Hall
seem
to
pledge
,
be
not
belie
on
a
long
acquaintance
with
the
place
and
its
inmate
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
turn
out
to
be
what
she
appear
,
a
placid
-
tempered
,
kind
-
natured
woman
,
of
competent
education
and
average
intelligence
.
<EOS>
My
pupil
be
a
lively
child
,
who
have
be
spoil
and
indulge
,
and
therefore
be
sometimes
wayward
;
but
as
she
be
commit
entirely
to
my
care
,
and
no
injudicious
interference
from
any
quarter
ever
thwart
my
plan
for
her
improvement
,
she
soon
forget
her
little
freak
,
and
become
obedient
and
teachable
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
great
talent
,
no
marked
trait
of
character
,
no
peculiar
development
of
feeling
or
taste
which
raise
her
one
inch
above
the
ordinary
level
of
childhood
;
but
neither
have
she
any
deficiency
or
vice
which
sink
her
below
it
.
<EOS>
She
make
reasonable
progress
,
entertain
for
me
a
vivacious
,
though
perhaps
not
very
profound
,
affection
;
and
by
her
simplicity
,
gay
prattle
,
and
effort
to
please
,
inspire
me
,
in
return
,
with
a
degree
of
attachment
sufficient
to
make
us
both
content
in
each
other
's
society
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
_
par
parenthese
_
,
will
be
think
cool
language
by
person
who
entertain
solemn
doctrine
about
the
angelic
nature
of
child
,
and
the
duty
of
those
charge
with
their
education
to
conceive
for
them
an
idolatrous
devotion
:
but
I
be
not
write
to
flatter
parental
egotism
,
to
echo
can
not
,
or
prop
up
humbug
;
I
be
merely
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
feel
a
conscientious
solicitude
for
Adele
's
welfare
and
progress
,
and
a
quiet
liking
for
her
little
self
:
just
as
I
cherish
towards
Mrs.
Fairfax
a
thankfulness
for
her
kindness
,
and
a
pleasure
in
her
society
proportionate
to
the
tranquil
regard
she
have
for
me
,
and
the
moderation
of
her
mind
and
character
.
  
<EOS>
anybody
may
blame
me
who
like
,
when
I
add
further
,
that
,
now
and
then
,
when
I
take
a
walk
by
myself
in
the
ground
;
when
I
go
down
to
the
gate
and
look
through
them
along
the
road
;
or
when
,
while
Adele
play
with
her
nurse
,
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
make
jelly
in
the
storeroom
,
I
climb
the
three
staircase
,
raise
the
trap
-
door
of
the
attic
,
and
have
reach
the
lead
,
look
out
afar
over
sequester
field
and
hill
,
and
along
dim
sky
-
line
 
<EOS>
that
then
I
long
for
a
power
of
vision
which
may
overpass
that
limit
;
which
may
reach
the
busy
world
,
town
,
region
full
of
life
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
but
never
see
 
that
then
I
desire
more
of
practical
experience
than
I
possess
;
more
of
intercourse
with
my
kind
,
of
acquaintance
with
variety
of
character
,
than
be
here
within
my
reach
.
<EOS>
I
value
what
be
good
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
what
be
good
in
Adele
;
but
I
believe
in
the
existence
of
other
and
more
vivid
kind
of
goodness
,
and
what
I
believe
in
I
wish
to
behold
.
  
<EOS>
who
blame
me
?
<EOS>
many
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
shall
be
call
discontent
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
:
the
restlessness
be
in
my
nature
;
it
agitate
me
to
pain
sometimes
.
<EOS>
then
my
sole
relief
be
to
walk
along
the
corridor
of
the
third
storey
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
safe
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
spot
,
and
allow
my
mind
's
eye
to
dwell
on
whatever
bright
vision
rise
before
it
 
and
,
certainly
,
they
be
many
and
glowing
;
<EOS>
to
let
my
heart
be
heave
by
the
exultant
movement
,
which
,
while
it
swell
it
in
trouble
,
expand
it
with
life
;
and
,
good
of
all
,
to
open
my
inward
ear
to
a
tale
that
be
never
end
 
a
tale
my
imagination
create
,
and
narrate
continuously
;
quicken
with
all
of
incident
,
life
,
fire
,
feeling
,
that
I
desire
and
have
not
in
my
actual
existence
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
say
human
being
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
tranquillity
:
they
must
have
action
;
and
they
will
make
it
if
they
can
not
find
it
.
<EOS>
million
be
condemn
to
a
stiller
doom
than
mine
,
and
million
be
in
silent
revolt
against
their
lot
.
<EOS>
nobody
know
how
many
rebellion
besides
political
rebellion
ferment
in
the
masse
of
life
which
people
earth
.
<EOS>
woman
be
suppose
to
be
very
calm
generally
:
but
woman
feel
just
as
man
feel
;
they
need
exercise
for
their
faculty
,
and
a
field
for
their
effort
,
as
much
as
their
brother
do
;
they
suffer
from
too
rigid
a
restraint
,
too
absolute
a
stagnation
,
precisely
as
man
would
suffer
;
and
it
be
narrow
-
minded
in
their
more
privileged
fellow
-
creature
to
say
that
they
ought
to
confine
themselves
to
make
pudding
and
knit
stocking
,
to
play
on
the
piano
and
embroidering
bag
.
<EOS>
It
be
thoughtless
to
condemn
them
,
or
laugh
at
them
,
if
they
seek
to
do
more
or
learn
more
than
custom
have
pronounce
necessary
for
their
sex
.
  
<EOS>
when
thus
alone
,
I
not
unfrequently
hear
Grace
Poole
's
laugh
:
the
same
peal
,
the
same
low
,
slow
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
which
,
when
first
hear
,
have
thrill
me
<EOS>
:
I
hear
,
too
,
her
eccentric
murmur
;
strange
than
her
laugh
.
<EOS>
there
be
day
when
she
be
quite
silent
;
but
there
be
other
when
I
could
not
account
for
the
sound
she
make
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
see
her
:
she
would
come
out
of
her
room
with
a
basin
,
or
a
plate
,
or
a
tray
in
her
hand
,
go
down
to
the
kitchen
and
shortly
return
,
generally
(
oh
,
romantic
reader
,
forgive
me
for
tell
the
plain
truth
!
)
<EOS>
bear
a
pot
of
porter
.
<EOS>
Her
appearance
always
act
as
a
damper
to
the
curiosity
raise
by
her
oral
oddity
:
hard
-
featured
and
staid
,
she
have
no
point
to
which
interest
could
attach
.
<EOS>
I
make
some
attempt
to
draw
her
into
conversation
,
but
she
seem
a
person
of
few
word
:
a
monosyllabic
reply
usually
cut
short
every
effort
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
member
of
the
household
,
viz
.
,
John
and
his
wife
,
Leah
the
housemaid
,
and
Sophie
the
french
nurse
,
be
decent
people
;
but
in
no
respect
remarkable
;
with
Sophie
I
use
to
talk
French
,
and
sometimes
I
ask
her
question
about
her
native
country
;
but
she
be
not
of
a
descriptive
or
narrative
turn
,
and
generally
give
such
vapid
and
confused
answer
as
be
calculate
rather
to
check
than
encourage
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
October
,
November

December
pass
away
.
<EOS>
one
afternoon
in
January
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
beg
a
holiday
for
Adele
,
because
she
have
a
cold
;
and
,
as
Adele
second
the
request
with
an
ardour
that
remind
me
how
precious
occasional
holiday
have
be
to
me
in
my
own
childhood
,
I
accord
it
,
deem
that
I
do
well
in
show
pliability
on
the
point
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
,
calm
day
,
though
very
cold
;
I
be
tired
of
sit
still
in
the
library
through
a
whole
long
morning
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
just
write
a
letter
which
be
wait
to
be
post
,
so
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
cloak
and
volunteer
to
carry
it
to
Hay
;
the
distance
,
two
mile
,
would
be
a
pleasant
winter
afternoon
walk
.
<EOS>
have
see
Adele
comfortably
seat
in
her
little
chair
by
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
parlour
fireside
,
and
give
her
her
good
wax
doll
(
which
I
usually
keep
envelop
in
silver
paper
in
a
drawer
)
to
play
with
,
and
a
story
-
book
for
change
of
amusement
;
and
have
reply
to
her
"
Revenez

,
ma
bonne
amie
,
ma
chere
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
"
with
a
kiss
I
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
ground
be
hard
,
the
air
be
still
,
my
road
be
lonely
;
I
walk
fast
till
I
get
warm
,
and
then
I
walk
slowly
to
enjoy
and
analyse
the
specie
of
pleasure
brood
for
me
in
the
hour
and
situation
.
<EOS>
It
be
three
o'clock
;
the
church
bell
toll
as
I
pass
under
the
belfry
:
the
charm
of
the
hour
lie
in
its
approach
dimness
,
in
the
low
-
glide
and
pale
-
beaming
sun
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
mile
from
Thornfield
,
in
a
lane
note
for
wild
rose
in
summer
,
for
nut
and
blackberry
in
autumn
,
and
even
now
possess
a
few
coral
treasure
in
hip
and
haw
,
but
whose
good
winter
delight
lie
in
its
utter
solitude
and
leafless
repose
.
<EOS>
if
a
breath
of
air
stir
,
it
make
no
sound
here
;
for
there
be
not
a
holly
,
not
an
evergreen
to
rustle
,
and
the
strip
hawthorn
and
hazel
<EOS>
bush
be
as
still
as
the
white
,
wear
stone
which
causeway
the
middle
of
the
path
.
<EOS>
far
and
wide
,
on
each
side
,
there
be
only
field
,
where
no
cattle
now
browse
;
and
<EOS>
the
little
brown
bird
,
which
stir
occasionally
in
the
hedge
,
look
like
single
russet
leave
that
have
forget
to
drop
.
  
<EOS>
this
lane
incline
up
-
hill
all
the
way
to
Hay
;
have
reach
the
middle
,
I
sit
down
on
a
stile
which
lead
thence
into
a
field
.
<EOS>
gather
my
mantle
about
me
,
and
shelter
my
hand
in
my
muff
,
I
do
not
feel
the
cold
,
though
it
freeze
keenly
;
as
be
attest
by
a
sheet
of
ice
cover
the
causeway
,
where
a
little
brooklet
,
now
congealed
,
have
overflow
after
a
rapid
thaw
some
day
since
.
<EOS>
from
my
seat
I
could
look
down
on
Thornfield
:
the
grey
and
battlemented
hall
be
the
principal
object
in
the
vale
below
me
;
its
wood
and
dark
rookery
rise
against
the
west
.
<EOS>
I
linger
till
the
sun
go
down
amongst
the
tree
,
and
sink
crimson
and
clear
behind
them
.
<EOS>
I
then
turn
eastward
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
hill
-
top
above
me
sit
the
rise
moon
;
pale
yet
as
a
cloud
,
but
brighten
momentarily
,
she
look
over
Hay
,
which
,
half
lose
in
tree
,
send
up
a
blue
smoke
from
its
few
chimney
:
it
be
yet
a
mile
distant
,
but
in
the
absolute
hush
I
could
hear
plainly
its
thin
murmur
of
life
.
<EOS>
My
ear
,
too
,
feel
the
flow
of
current
;
in
what
dale
and
depth
I
could
not
tell
:
but
there
be
many
hill
beyond
Hay
,
and
doubtless
many
beck
thread
their
pass
.
<EOS>
that
evening
calm
betray
alike
the
tinkle
of
the
near
stream
,
the
sough
of
the
most
remote
.
  
<EOS>
a
rude
noise
break
on
these
fine
rippling
and
whispering
,
at
once
so
far
away
and
so
clear
:
<EOS>
a
positive
tramp
,
tramp
,
a
metallic
clatter
,
which
efface
the
soft
wave
-
wandering
;
as
,
in
a
picture
,
the
solid
mass
of
a
crag
,
or
the
rough
bole
of
a
great
oak
,
draw
in
dark
and
strong
on
the
foreground
,
efface
the
aerial
distance
of
azure
hill
,
sunny
horizon
,
and
blend
cloud
where
tint
melt
into
tint
.
  
<EOS>
the
din
be
on
the
causeway
:
a
horse
be
come
;
<EOS>
the
winding
of
the
lane
yet
hide
it
,
but
it
approach
.
<EOS>
I
be
just
leave
the
stile
;
yet
,
as
the
path
be
narrow
,
I
sit
still
to
let
it
go
by
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
I
be
young
,
and
all
sort
of
fancy
bright
and
dark
tenant
my
mind
:
the
memory
of
nursery
story
be
there
amongst
other
rubbish
;
and
when
they
recur
,
mature
youth
add
to
them
a
vigour
and
vividness
beyond
what
childhood
could
give
.
<EOS>
as
this
horse
approach
,
and
as
I
watch
for
it
to
appear
through
the
dusk
,
I
remember
certain
of
Bessie
's
tale
,
wherein
figure
a
north
-
of
-
England
spirit
call
a
"
Gytrash
,
"
which
,
in
the
form
of
horse
,
mule
,
or
large
dog
,
haunt
solitary
way
,
and
sometimes
come
upon
belate
traveller
,
as
this
horse
be
now
come
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
near
,
but
not
yet
in
sight
;
when
,
in
addition
to
the
tramp
,
tramp
,
I
hear
a
rush
under
the
hedge
,
and
close
down
by
the
hazel
<EOS>
stem
glide
a
great
dog
,
whose
black
and
white
colour
make
him
a
distinct
object
against
the
tree
.
<EOS>
It
be
exactly
one
form
of
Bessie
's
Gytrash
 
a
lion
-
like
creature
with
long
hair
and
a
huge
head
:
it
pass
me
,
however
,
quietly
enough
;
not
stay
to
look
up
,
with
strange
pretercanine
eye
,
in
my
face
,
as
I
half
expect
it
would
.
<EOS>
the
horse
follow
,
 
a
tall
steed
,
and
on
its
back
a
rider
.
<EOS>
the
man
,
the
human
being
,
break
the
spell
at
once
.
<EOS>
nothing
ever
ride
the
Gytrash
:
it
be
always
alone
;
and
goblin
,
to
my
notion
,
though
they
may
tenant
the
dumb
carcass
of
beast
,
could
scarce
covet
shelter
in
the
commonplace
human
form
.
<EOS>
no
Gytrash
be
this
,
 
only
a
traveller
take
the
short
cut
to
Millcote
.
<EOS>
He
pass
,
and
I
go
on
;
a
few
step
,
and
<EOS>
I
turn
:
a
slide
sound
and
an
exclamation
of
"
what
the
deuce
be
to
do
now
?
"
and
a
clatter
tumble
,
arrest
my
attention
.
<EOS>
man
and
horse
be
down
;
they
have
slip
on
the
sheet
of
ice
which
glaze
the
causeway
.
<EOS>
the
dog
come
bound
back
,
and
see
his
master
in
a
predicament
,
and
hear
the
horse
groan
,
bark
till
<EOS>
the
evening
hill
echo
the
sound
,
which
be
deep
in
proportion
to
his
magnitude
.
<EOS>
He
snuff
round
the
prostrate
group
,
and
then
he
run
up
to
me
;
it
be
all
he
could
do
,
 
there
be
no
other
help
at
hand
to
summon
.
<EOS>
I
obey
him
,
and
walk
down
to
the
traveller
,
by
this
time
struggle
himself
free
of
his
steed
.
<EOS>
His
effort
be
so
vigorous
,
I
think
he
could
not
be
much
hurt
;
but
I
ask
him
the
question
    
"
be
you
injure
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
swear
,
but
be
not
certain
;
however
,
he
be
pronounce
some
formula
which
prevent
him
from
reply
to
me
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
anything
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
just
stand
on
one
side
,
"
he
answer
as
he
rise
,
first
to
his
knee
,
and
then
to
his
foot
.
<EOS>
I
do
;
whereupon
begin
a
heaving
,
stamp
,
clatter
process
,
accompany
by
a
barking
and
baying
which
remove
me
effectually
some
yard
'
distance
;
but
I
would
not
be
drive
quite
away
till
I
see
the
event
.
<EOS>
this
be
finally
fortunate
;
the
horse
be
re
-
establish
,
and
the
dog
be
silence
with
a
"
down
,
pilot
!
"
<EOS>
the
traveller
now
,
stoop
,
feel
his
foot
and
leg
,
as
if
try
whether
they
be
sound
;
apparently
something
ail
them
,
for
he
halt
to
the
stile
whence
I
have
just
rise
,
and
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
mood
for
be
useful
,
or
at
least
officious
,
I
think
,
for
I
now
draw
near
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
hurt
,
and
want
help
,
sir
,
I
can
fetch
some
one
either
from
Thornfield
Hall
or
from
Hay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
:
<EOS>
I
shall
do
:
<EOS>
I
have
no
broken
bone
,
 
only
a
sprain
;
"
and
again
he
stand
up
and
try
his
foot
,
but
the
result
extort
an
involuntary
"
ugh
!
"
  
<EOS>
something
of
daylight
still
linger
,
and
the
moon
be
wax
bright
:
I
could
see
him
plainly
.
<EOS>
His
figure
be
envelop
in
a
ride
cloak
,
fur
collar
and
steel
clasp
;
its
detail
be
not
apparent
,
but
I
trace
the
general
point
of
middle
height
and
considerable
breadth
of
chest
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
dark
face
,
with
stern
feature
and
a
heavy
brow
;
his
eye
and
gather
eyebrow
look
ireful
and
thwart
just
now
;
he
be
past
youth
,
but
have
not
reach
middle
-
age
;
perhaps
he
may
be
thirty
-
five
.
<EOS>
I
feel
no
fear
of
him
,
and
but
little
shyness
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
a
handsome
,
heroic-
look
young
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
dare
to
stand
thus
question
him
against
his
will
,
and
offer
my
service
unasked
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
ever
see
a
handsome
youth
;
never
in
my
life
speak
to
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
theoretical
reverence
and
homage
for
beauty
,
elegance
,
gallantry
,
fascination
;
but
have
I
meet
those
quality
incarnate
in
masculine
shape
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
know
instinctively
that
they
neither
have
nor
could
have
sympathy
with
anything
in
me
,
and
should
have
shun
them
as
one
would
fire
,
lightning
,
or
anything
else
that
be
bright
but
antipathetic
.
  
<EOS>
if
even
this
stranger
have
smile
and
be
good
-
humoured
to
me
when
I
address
him
;
if
he
have
put
off
my
offer
of
assistance
gaily
and
with
thank
,
I
should
have
go
on
my
way
and
not
feel
any
vocation
to
renew
inquiry
:
but
the
frown
,
the
roughness
of
the
traveller
,
set
me
at
my
ease
:
<EOS>
I
retain
my
station
when
he
wave
to
me
to
go
,
and
announce
    
"
I
can
not
think
of
leave
you
,
sir
,
at
so
late
an
hour
,
in
this
solitary
lane
,
till
I
see
you
be
fit
to
mount
your
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
when
I
say
this
;
he
have
hardly
turn
his
eye
in
my
direction
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
ought
to
be
at
home
yourself
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
have
a
home
in
this
neighbourhood
:
where
do
you
come
from
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
from
just
below
<EOS>
;
and
I
be
not
at
all
afraid
of
be
out
late
when
it
be
moonlight
:
I
will
run
over
to
Hay
for
you
with
pleasure
,
if
you
wish
it
:
indeed
,
I
be
go
there
to
post
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
live
just
below
 
<EOS>
do
you
mean
at
that
house
with
the
battlement
?
<EOS>
"
point
to
Thornfield
Hall
,
on
which
the
moon
cast
a
hoary
gleam
,
bring
it
out
distinct
and
pale
from
the
wood
that
,
by
contrast
with
the
western
sky
,
now
seem
one
mass
of
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
whose
house
be
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
Mr.
Rochester

<EOS>
"
no

I

never

him

<EOS>
"
He
be
not

,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
tell
me
where
he
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
a
servant
at
the
hall
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
You
be
 
<EOS>
"
He
stop
,
run
his
eye
over
my
dress
,
which
,
as
usual
,
be
quite
simple
:
a
black
merino
cloak
,
a
black
beaver
bonnet
;
neither
of
them
half
fine
enough
for
a
lady's
-
maid
.
<EOS>
He
seem
puzzled
to
decide
what
I
be
;
I
help
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
governess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
the
governess
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeat
;
"
deuce
take
me
,
if
I
have
not
forget
!
<EOS>
the
governess
!
"
<EOS>
and
again
my
raiment
underwent
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
in
two
minute
he
rise
from
the
stile
:
his
face
express
pain
when
he
try
to
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
commission
you
to
fetch
help
,
"
he
say
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
may
help
me
<EOS>
a
little
yourself
,
if
you
will
be
so
kind

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
an

I

a
stick

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
  
<EOS>

try
to
get
hold
of
my
horse
's
bridle
and
lead
him
to
me
:
you
be
not
afraid

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
afraid
to
touch
a
horse
when
alone
,
but
when
tell
to
do
it
,
I
be
dispose
to
obey
.
<EOS>
I
put
down
my
muff
on
the
stile
,
and
go
up
to
the
tall
steed
;
I
endeavour
to
catch
the
bridle
,
but
it
be
a
spirited
thing
,
and
would
not
let
me
come
near
its
head
;
I
make
effort
on
effort
,
though
in
vain
:
meantime
,
I
be
mortally
afraid
of
its
trample
fore

foot

<EOS>
the
traveller
wait
and
watch
for
some
time
,
and
at
last
he
laugh
.

"
I

he
say
,
"
the

never

so
all
you

<EOS>
He
lay
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
lean
on
me
with
some
stress
,
limp
to
his
horse

<EOS>
have
once
catch
the

he
master
it
directly
and
spring
to

grimly

his

release

me
my

there
under
the
hedge

it

find
it

Hay

as
fast

<EOS>
a
touch
of
a
spurred
heel
make
his
horse
first
start
and
rear
,
and
then
bind
away
;
the
dog
rush
in
his
trace
;
all
three
vanish
,
  
"
like
heath
that

in
the
wilderness

the
wild
wind
whirl
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
take
up
my
muff
and
walk
on
.
<EOS>
the
incident
have
occur
and
be
go
for
me
:
it
<EOS>
_
be
_
an
incident
of
no
moment
,
no
romance
,
<EOS>
no
interest
in
a
sense
;
yet
it
mark
with
change
one
single
hour
of
a
monotonous
life
.
<EOS>
My
help
have
be
need
and
claim
;
I
have
give
it
<EOS>
:
I
be
pleased
to
have
do
something
;
trivial
,
transitory
though
the
deed
be
,
it
be
yet
an
active
thing
,
and
I
be
weary
of
an
existence
all
passive
.
<EOS>
the
new
face
,
too
,
be
like
a
new
picture
introduce
to
the
gallery
of
memory
;
and
it
be
dissimilar
to
all
the
other
hang
there
:
firstly
,
because
it
be
masculine
;
and
,
secondly
,
because
it
be
dark
,
strong
,
and
stern
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
still
before
me
when
I
enter
Hay
,
and
slip
the
letter
into
the
post
-
office
;
I
see
it
as
I
walk
fast
down
-
hill
all
the
way
home
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
the
stile
,
I
stop
a
minute
,
look
round
and
listen
,
with
an
idea
that
a
horse
's
hoofs
may
ring
on
the
causeway
again
,
and
that
a
rider
in
a
cloak
,
and
a
Gytrash
-
like
Newfoundland
dog
,
may
be
again
apparent
:
I
see
only
the
hedge
and
a
pollard
willow
before
me
,
rise
up
still
and
straight
to
meet
the
moonbeam
;
I
hear
only
the
faint
waft
of
wind
roam
fitful
among
the
tree
round
Thornfield
,
a
mile
distant
;
and
when
I
glance
down
in
the
direction
of
the
murmur
,
my
eye
,
traverse
the
hall
-
front
,
catch
a
light
kindle
in
a
window
:
it
remind
me
that
I
be
late
,
and
I
hurry
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
re
-
enter
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
to
pass
its
threshold
be
to
return
to
stagnation
;
to
cross
the
silent
hall
,
to
ascend
the
darksome
staircase
,
to
seek
my
own
lonely
little
room
,
and
then
to
meet
tranquil
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
spend
the
long
winter
evening
with
her
,
and
her
only
,
be
to
quell
wholly
the
faint
excitement
waken
by
my
walk
,
 
to
slip
again
over
my
faculty
the
viewless
fetter
of
an
uniform
and
too
still
existence
;
of
an
existence
whose
very
privilege
of
security
and
ease
I
be
become
incapable
of
appreciate
.
<EOS>
what
good
it
would
have
do
me
at
that
time
to
have
be
toss
in
the
storm
of
an
uncertain
struggle
life
,
and
to
have
be
teach
by
rough
and
bitter
experience
to
long
for
the
calm
amidst
which
I
now
repine
!
<EOS>
yes
,
just
as
much
good
as
it
would
do
a
man
tired
of
sit
still
in
a
"
too
easy
chair
"
to
take
a
long
walk
<EOS>
:
and
just
as
natural
be
the
wish
to
stir
,
under
my
circumstance
,
as
it
would
be
under
his
.
  
<EOS>
I
linger
at
the
gate
;
I
linger
on
the
lawn
;
I
pace
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
pavement
;
the
shutter
of
the
glass
door
be
close
;
I
could
not
see
into
the
interior
;
and
both
my
eye
and
spirit
seem
draw
from
the
gloomy
house
 
from
the
grey
-
hollow
fill
with
rayless
cell
,
as
it
appear
to
me
 
to
that
sky
expand
before
me
,
 
a
blue
sea
absolve
from
taint
of
cloud
;
the
moon
ascend
it
in
solemn
march
;
her
orb
seem
to
look
up
as
she
leave
the
hill
-
top
,
from
behind
which
she
have
come
,
far
and
farther
below
her
,
and
aspire
to
the
zenith
,
midnight
dark
in
its
fathomless
depth
and
measureless
distance
;
and
for
those
tremble
star
that
follow
her
course
;
they
make
my
heart
tremble
,
my
vein
glow
when
I
view
them
.
<EOS>
little
thing
recall
us
to
earth
;
the
clock
strike
in
the
hall
;
that
suffice
;
I
turn
from
moon
and
star
,
open
a
side-
door
,
and
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
the
hall
be
not
dark
,
nor
yet
be
it
light
,
only
by
the
high
-
hung
bronze
lamp
;
a
warm
glow
suffuse
both
it
and
the
low
step
of
the
oak
staircase
.
<EOS>
this
ruddy
shine
issue
from
the
great
dining
-
room
,
whose
two-
leave
door
stand
open
,
and
show
a
genial
fire
in
the
grate
,
glance
on
marble
hearth
and
brass
fire
-
iron
,
and
reveal
purple
drapery
and
polished
furniture
,
in
the
most
pleasant
radiance
.
<EOS>
It
reveal
,
too
,
a
group
near
the
mantelpiece
:
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
catch
it
,
and
scarcely
become
aware
of
a
cheerful
mingling
of
voice
,
amongst
which
I
seem
to
distinguish
the
tone
of
Adele
,
when
the
door
close
.
  
<EOS>
I
hasten
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
;
there
be
a
fire
there
too
,
but
no
candle
,
and
no
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
instead
,
all
alone
,
sit
upright
on
the
rug
,
and
gaze
with
gravity
at
the
blaze
,
I
beheld
a
great
black
and
white
long
-
haired
dog
,
just
like
the
Gytrash
of
the
lane
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
like
it
<EOS>
that
I
go
forward
and
say
 
"
Pilot
"
and
the
thing
get
up
and
come
to
me
and
snuff
me
.
<EOS>
I
caress
him
,
and
he
wag
his
great
tail
;
but
he
look
an
eerie
creature
to
be
alone
with
,
and
I
could
not
tell
whence
he
have
come
.
<EOS>
I
ring
the
bell
,
for
I
want
a
candle
;
and
I
want
,
too
,
to
get
an
account
of
this
visitant
.
<EOS>
Leah

<EOS>
"
what
dog

this

"
  
<EOS>
"
He

yes

they
be
in

room
,
and
John

go

a

for

have
an

his

do
the

fall
in
Hay
Lane

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

come
down

hill
;
it
slip
on
some
ice
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
bring
me
a
candle
<EOS>
will
you
Leah
?
"
  
<EOS>
Leah
bring
it
;
she
enter
,
follow
by
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
repeat
the
news
;
add
that
Mr.
Carter
the
surgeon
be
come
,
and
be
now
with
Mr.
Rochester
:
then
she
hurry
out
to
give
order
about
tea
,
and
I
go
upstairs
to
take
off
my
thing
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
it
seem
,
by
the
surgeon
's
order
,
go
to
bed
early
that
night
;
nor
do
he
rise
soon
next
morning
.
<EOS>
when
he
do
come
down
,
it
be
to
attend
to
business
:
his
agent
and
some
of
his
tenant
be
arrive
,
and
wait
to
speak
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
and
I
have
now
to
vacate
the
library
:
it
would
be
in
daily
requisition
as
a
reception
-
room
for
caller
.
<EOS>
a
fire
be
light
in
an
apartment
upstairs
,
and
there
I
carry
our
book
,
and
arrange
it
for
the
future
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
I
discern
in
the
course
of
the
morning
that
Thornfield
Hall
be
a
changed
place
:
no
longer
silent
as
a
church
<EOS>
,
it
echo
every
hour
or
two
to
a
knock
at
the
door
,
or
a
clang
of
the
bell
;
step
,
too
,
often
traverse
the
hall
,
and
new
voice
speak
in
different
key
below
;
a
rill
from
the
outer
world
be
flow
through
it
;
it
have
a
master
:
for
my
part
,
I
like
it
better
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
be
not
easy
to
teach
that
day
;
she
could
not
apply
:
she
keep
run
to
the
door
and
look
over
the
banister
to
see
if
she
could
get
a
glimpse
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
then
she
coin
pretext
to
go
downstairs
,
in
order
,
as
I
shrewdly
suspect
,
to
visit
the
library
,
where
I
know
she
be
not
want
;
then
,
when
I
get
a
little
angry
,
and
make
her
sit
still
,
she
continue
to
talk
incessantly
of
her
"
ami
,
Monsieur
Edouard
Fairfax
_
de
_
Rochester
,
"
as
she
dub
him
<EOS>
(
I
have
not
before
hear
his
prenomen
)
,
and
to
conjecture
what
present

that
when

there
would

amongst
it

"
  
<EOS>
I
and
my
pupil
dine
as
usual
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
parlour
;
the
afternoon
be
wild
and
snowy
,
and
we
pass
it
in
the
schoolroom
.
<EOS>
at
dark
I
allow
Adele
to
put
away
book
and
work
,
and
to
run
downstairs
;
for
,
from
the
comparative
silence
below
,
and
from
the
cessation
of
appeal
to
the
door
-
bell
,
I
conjecture
that
Mr.
Rochester
be
now
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
leave
alone
,
I
walk
to
the
window
;
but
nothing
be
to
be
see
thence
:
<EOS>
twilight
and
snowflake
together
thicken
the
air
,
and
hide
the
very
shrub
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
I
let
down
the
curtain
and
go
back
to
the
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
clear
ember
I
be
trace
a
view
,
not
unlike
a
picture
I
remember
to
have
see
of
the
castle
of
Heidelberg
,
on
the
Rhine
,
when
Mrs.
Fairfax
come
in
,
break
up
by
her
entrance
<EOS>
the
fiery
mosaic
I
have
be
pierce
together
,
and
scatter
too
some
heavy
unwelcome
thought
that
be
begin
to
throng
on
my
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
would
be
glad
if
you
and
your
pupil
would
take
tea
with
him
in
the
drawing
-
room
this
evening
,
"
say
she
:
"
he
have
be
so
much
engaged
all
day
that
he
could
not
ask
to
see
you
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
be
his
tea
-
time
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
at
six
o'clock
:
he
keep
early
hour
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
You
have
well
change
your
frock
now
;
I
will
go
with
you
and
fasten
it
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
candle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
necessary
to
change
my
frock
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
have
well
:
I
always
dress
for
the
evening
when
Mr.
Rochester
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
additional
ceremony
seem
somewhat
stately
;
however
,
I
repair
to
my
room
,
and
,
with
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
aid
,
replace
my
black
stuff
dress
by
one
of
black
silk
;
the
good
and
the
only
additional
one
I
have
,
except
one
of
light
grey
,
which
,
in
my
Lowood
notion
of
the
toilette
,
I
think
too
fine
to
be
wear
,
except
on
first
-
rate
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
a
brooch
,
"
say
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
single
little
pearl
ornament
which
Miss
Temple
give
me
as
a
part
keepsake
:
I
put
it
on
,
and
then
we
go
downstairs
.
<EOS>
unused
as
I
be
to
stranger
,
it
be
rather
a
trial
to
appear
thus
formally
summon
in
Mr.
Rochester
's
presence
.
<EOS>
I
let
Mrs.
Fairfax
precede
me
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
keep
in
her
shade
as
we
cross
that
apartment
;
and
,
pass
the
arch
,
whose
curtain
be
now
drop
,
enter
the
elegant
recess
beyond
.
  
<EOS>
two
wax
candle
stand
light
on
the
table
,
and
two
on
the
mantelpiece
;
bask
in
the
light
and
heat
of
a
superb
fire
,
lie
pilot
 
Adele
knelt
near
him
.
<EOS>
half
recline
on
a
couch
appear
Mr.
Rochester
,
his
foot
support
by
the
cushion
;
he
be
look
at
Adele
and
the
dog
:
<EOS>
the
fire
shone
full
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
traveller
with
his
broad
and
jetty
eyebrow
;
his
square
forehead
,
make
squarer
by
the
horizontal
sweep
of
his
black
hair
.
<EOS>
I
recognise
his
decisive
nose
,
more
remarkable
for
character
than
beauty
;
his
full
nostril
,
denoting
,
I
think
,
choler
;
his
grim
mouth
,
chin
,
and
jaw
 
<EOS>
yes
,
all
three
be
very
grim
,
and
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
His
shape
,
now
divest
of
cloak
,
I
perceive
harmonise
in
squareness
with
his
physiognomy
:
I
suppose
it
be
a
good
figure
in
the
athletic
sense
of
the
term
 
broad
chested
and
thin
flank
,
though
neither
tall
nor
graceful
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
must
have
be
aware
of
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
and
myself
;
but
it
appear
he
be
not
in
the
mood
to
notice
us
,
for
he
never
lift
his
head
as
we
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
Miss
Eyre
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
in
her
quiet
way
.
<EOS>
He
bow
,
still
not
take
his
eye
from
the
group
of
the
dog
and
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
Miss
Eyre
be
seat
,
"
say
he
:
<EOS>
and
there
be
something
in
the
force
stiff
bow
,
in
the
impatient
yet
formal
tone
,
which
seem
further
to
express
,
"
<EOS>
what
the
deuce
be
it
to
me
whether
Miss
Eyre
be
there
or
not
?
<EOS>
at
this
moment
I
be
not
disposed
to
accost
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
sit
down
quite
disembarrassed
.
<EOS>
a
reception
of
finished
politeness
would
probably
have
confuse
me
:
I
could
not
have
return
or
repay
it
by
answer
grace
and
elegance
on
my
part
;
but
harsh
caprice
lay
me
under
no
obligation
;
on
the
contrary
,
a
decent
quiescence
,
under
the
freak
of
manner
,
give
me
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
eccentricity
of
the
proceeding
be
piquant
:
I
feel
interested
to
see
how
he
would
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
on
as
a
statue
would
,
that
is
,
he
neither
speak
nor
move
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
seem
to
think
it
necessary
that
some
one
should
be
amiable
,
and
she
begin
to
talk
.
<EOS>
kindly
,
as
usual
 
and
,
as
usual
,
rather
trite
 
<EOS>
she
condole
with
him
on
the
pressure
of
business
<EOS>
he
have
have
all
day
;
on
the
annoyance
it
must
have
be
to
him
with
that
painful
sprain
:
then
she
commend
his
patience
and
perseverance
in
go
through
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
should
like
some
tea
,
"
be
the
sole
rejoinder
she
get
.
<EOS>
She
hasten
to
ring
the
bell
;
and
when
the
tray
come
,
she
proceed
to
arrange
the
cup
,
spoon
,
&
c.
,
with
assiduous
celerity
.
<EOS>
I
and
Adele
go
to
the
table
;
but
the
master
do
not
leave
his
couch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
hand
Mr.
Rochester
's
cup
?
"
say
Mrs.
Fairfax
to
me
;
"
Adele
may
perhaps
spill
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
as
request
.
<EOS>
as
he
take
the
cup
from
my
hand
,
Adele
,
think
the
moment
propitious
for
make
a
request
in
my
favour
,
cry
out

and
he
search
my

with

that
I

be
dark
,
irate
,
and
pierce
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly

I
should
be
oblige
to
take
time
,
sir
,
before
I
could
give
you
an
answer
worthy

your
acceptance
:
<EOS>
a
present
have
many
face
to

have
it
not

consider
all

before
pronounce
an

its
nature

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Eyre
,
you
be
not
so
unsophisticated
as
Adele
:
she
demand
a

"
clamorously
,
the
moment
she
see
me
:
you
beat
about
the
bush
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
have
less
confidence
in
my
desert
than
Adele
have
:
she
can
prefer
the
claim
of
old
acquaintance
,
and
the
right
too
of
custom
;
for
she
say
you
have
always
be
in
the
habit
of
give
her
plaything
;
but
if
I
have
to
make
out
a
case
I
should
be
puzzle
,
since
I
be
a
stranger
,
and
have
do
nothing
to
entitle
me
to
an
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
fall
back
on
over
-
modesty
!
<EOS>
I
have
examine
Adele
,
and
find
you
have
take
great
pain
with
her
:
she
be
not
bright
,
she
have
no
talent
;
yet
in
a
short
time
she
have
make
much
improvement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
you
have
now
give
me
my

cadeau

I
be
oblige
to
you
:
it
be
the
meed
teacher

covet
 
praise
of
their

progress

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
say
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
he
take
his
tea
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
to
the
fire
,
"

the
master
,
when
the
tray
be

away

Mrs.

have
settle
into
a
corner
with
her

while
Adele

round

me
the
beautiful
book

obey

when

come
on

in
Hay
Lane
last
night

unaccountably
of
fairy
tale

have
half
a
mind
to
demand
whether
you

for

and
not

Mrs.

drop

with

I

tell
you

what
they

I
must
premise

the

be
strike

my

not

my
fancy

work
out

a

portrait
of

thing
I
have
conceive

these

in
water

colour

<EOS>
the
first

cloud
low

livid
,
roll
over
a
swollen
sea
:
all
the
distance
be
in
eclipse
;
so
,
too
,
be
the
foreground
;
or
rather
,
<EOS>
the
near
billow
,
for
there
be
no
land

<EOS>
one
gleam
of
light
lift
into
relief
a
half
-
submerged
mast

on
which
sit
a
cormorant
,
dark
and
large
,
with
wing
fleck
with
foam
;
its
beak
hold
a
gold
bracelet
set
with
gem
,
that
I
have
touch
with
as
brilliant
tint
as
my
palette
could
yield
,
and
as
glitter
distinctness
as
my
pencil
could
impart
.
<EOS>
sink
below
the
bird
and
mast
,
a
drown
corpse

through
the
green
water
;
a
fair
arm
be
the
only
limb
clearly
visible
,
whence
the
bracelet
have
be
wash
or
tear
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
picture
contain
for
foreground
only
the
dim
peak
of
a
hill
,
with
grass
and
some
leave
slant
as
if
by
a
breeze
.
<EOS>
beyond

above

an
expanse
of
sky

dark
blue
as
at
twilight

shape

I

the
dim
forehead

star

the
lineament
below

see

through

suffusion

vapour

the
eye
shine
dark
and
wild
;
the
hair
stream
shadowy

like
a
beamless
cloud
tear
by
storm

by
electric
travail

<EOS>
on
the
neck
lie
a
pale
reflection
like
moonlight
;
the
same
faint
lustre
touch
the
train
of
thin
cloud
from
which
rise
and
bow
this
vision
of
the
Evening
Star
.
  
<EOS>
the
third

pinnacle

an
iceberg

a
polar
winter
sky

a
muster
of
northern
light

dim
lance

close
serrie

along
the
horizon

<EOS>
throw
these
into
distance

in
the
foreground

a
colossal
head

iceberg

<EOS>
two
thin
hand

under

forehead

up
before
the
low
feature
a
sable
veil

I
have
nothing

it

far
from
it

<EOS>
I
be
torment
by
the
contrast
between
my
idea

my
handiwork

in

case
I
have
imagine
something
which
I

not

have
scarce
tie
the
string
of

look
at

abruptly
    
"

nine
o'clock

he
endure
the

scarcely
seem

more

Mrs.

fold
up
her
knitting

we
curtsey
to

receive
a
frigid

withdrew

"
You

not

rejoin

after
put
Adele
to

well

I

so

he

very
changeful

abrupt

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

true
:
no
doubt
he
may
appear
so
to
a
stranger

but
I
be
so
accustomed
to
his

,
I
never

peculiarity

allowance
should
be
make

why

partly
because
it
be
his

we
can
none

and
partly
because
he
have
painful
thought

no

to
harass
him
,
and
make
his
spirit
unequal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
family
trouble

for

he

no

"
<EOS>
not

relative

yes

the
present
Mr.

not

very
long
in
possession
of

property
;
only
about
nine
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
nine
year
be
a
tolerable
time
.
<EOS>
be
he
so
very
fond
of

to
be
still
inconsolable
for
his
loss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
no
 
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
some
misunderstanding
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rowland
Rochester
be
not
quite
just
to
Mr.
Edward
;
and
perhaps
he
prejudice
his
father
against
him
.
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
be
fond
of
money
,
and
anxious
to
keep
the
family
estate
together
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
to
diminish
the
property
by
division
,
and
yet
he
be
anxious
that
Mr.
Edward
should
have
wealth
,
too
,
to
keep
up
the
consequence
of
the
name
;
<EOS>
and
,
soon
after
he
be
of
age
,
some
step
be
take
that
be
not
quite
fair
,
and
make
a
great
deal
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
old
Mr.
Rochester
and
Mr.
Rowland
combine
to
bring
Mr.
Edward
into
what
he
consider
a
painful
position
,
for
the
sake
of
make
his
fortune
:
what
the
precise
nature
of
that
position
be
I
never
clearly
know
,
but
his
spirit
could
not
brook
what
he
have
to
suffer
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
very
forgiving
:
he
break
with
his
family
,
and
now
for
many
year
he
have
lead
an
unsettled
kind
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
have
ever
be
resident
at
Thornfield
for
a
fortnight
together
,
since
the
death
of
his
brother
without
a
will
leave
him
master
of
the
estate
;
and
,
indeed
,
no
wonder
he
shun
the
old
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
he
shun
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
think
it
gloomy
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
answer
be
evasive
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
like
something
clear
;
but
Mrs.
Fairfax
either
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
give
me
more
explicit
information
of
the
origin

nature
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
trial
.
<EOS>
She
aver
they
be
a
mystery
to
herself
,
and
that
what
she
know
be
chiefly
from
conjecture
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
,
indeed
,
that
she
wish
me
to
drop
the
subject
,
which
I
do
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
for
several
subsequent
day
I
see
little
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
he
seem
much
engage
with
business
,
and
,
in
the
afternoon
,
gentleman
from
Millcote
or
the
neighbourhood
call
,
and
sometimes
stay
to
dine
with
him
.
<EOS>
when
his
sprain
be
well
enough
to
admit
of
horse
exercise
,
he
ride
out
a
good
deal
;
probably
to
return
these
visit
,
as
he
generally
do
not
come
back
till
late
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
interval
,
even
Adele
be
seldom
send
for
to
his
presence
,
and
all
my
acquaintance
with
him
be
confine
to
an
occasional
rencontre
in
the
hall
,
on
the
stair
,
or
in
the
gallery
,
when
he
would
sometimes
pass
me
haughtily
and
coldly
,
just
acknowledge
my
presence
by
a
distant
nod
or
a
cool
glance
,
and
sometimes
bow
and
smile
with
gentlemanlike
affability
.
<EOS>
His
change
of
mood
do
not
offend
me
,
because
I
see
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
alternation
;
the
ebb
and
flow
depend
on
cause
quite
disconnected
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
he
have
have
company
to
dinner
,
and
have
send
for
my
portfolio
;
in
order
,
doubtless
,
to
exhibit
its
content
:
the
gentleman
go
away
early
,
to
attend
a
public
meeting
at
Millcote
,
as
Mrs.
Fairfax
inform
me
;
but
the
night
be
wet
and
inclement
,
Mr.
Rochester
do
not
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
soon
after
they
be
go
he
ring
the
bell
<EOS>
:
a
message
come
that
I
and
Adele
be
to
go
downstairs
.
<EOS>
I
brush
Adele
's
hair
and
make
her
neat
,
and
have
ascertain
that
I
be
myself
in
my
usual
Quaker
trim
,
where
there
be
nothing
to
retouch
 
all
be
too
close
and
plain
,
braid
lock
include
,
to
admit
of
disarrangement
 
we
descend
,
Adele
wonder
whether
the
_
petit
coffre
_
be
at
length
come
;
for
,
owe
to
some
mistake
,
its
arrival
have
hitherto
be
delay
.
<EOS>
She
be
gratify
:
there
it
stand
,
a
little
carton
,
on
the
table
when
we
enter
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
appear
to
know
it
by
instinct
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
boite
!
<EOS>
ma
boite
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exclaim
she
,
run
towards
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
there
be
your
"
boite
"
at
last
:
take
it
into
a
corner
,
you
genuine
daughter
of
Paris
,
and
amuse
yourself
with
disembowel
it
,
"
say
the
deep
and
rather
sarcastic
voice
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
proceed
from
the
depth
of
an
immense
easy
-
chair
at
the
fireside
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
mind
,
"
he
continue
,
"
do
not
bother
me
with
any
detail
of
the
anatomical
process
,
or
any
notice
of
the
condition
of
the
entrail
:
let
your
operation
be
conduct
in
silence
:
<EOS>
tien
-
toi
tranquille
,
enfant
<EOS>
;
comprends
-
tu
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adele
seem
scarcely
to
need
the
warning
 
she
have
already
retire
to
a
sofa
with
her
treasure
,
and
be
busy
untie
the
cord
which
secure
the
lid
.
<EOS>
have
remove
this
impediment
,
and
lift
certain
silvery
envelope
of
tissue
paper
,
she
merely
exclaim
    
"
<EOS>
oh
ciel
!
<EOS>
Que
c'est
beau
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
remain
absorb
in
ecstatic
contemplation
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Miss
Eyre
there
?
"
<EOS>
now
demand
the
master
,
half
rise
from
his
seat
to
look
round
to
the
door
,
near
which
I
still
stand
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
well
,
come
forward
;
be
seat
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
draw
a
chair
near
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
fond
of
the
prattle
of
child
,
"
he
continue
;
"
for
,
old
bachelor
as
I
be
,
I
have
no
pleasant
association
connect
with
their
lisp
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
intolerable
to
me
to
pass
a
whole
evening
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
with
a
brat
.
<EOS>
do
not
draw
that
chair
farther
off
,
Miss
Eyre
;
sit
down
exactly
where
I
place
it
 
if
you
please
,
that
is
.
<EOS>
confound
these
civility
!
<EOS>
I
continually
forget
them
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
particularly
affect
simple
-
minded
old
lady
.
<EOS>
by
-
the
-
bye
,
I
must
have
mine
in
mind
;
it
will
not
do
to
neglect
her
;
she
be
a
Fairfax
,
or
we
would
to
one
;
and
blood
be
say
to
be
thick
than
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
ring
,
and
despatch
an
invitation
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
soon
arrive
,
knitting
-
basket
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
evening
,
madam
;
I
send
to
you
for
a
charitable
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
forbid
Adele
to
talk
to
me
about
her
present
,
and
she
be
burst
with
repletion
:
have
the
goodness
to
serve
her
as
auditress
and
interlocutrice
;
it
will
be
one
of
the
most
benevolent
act
you
ever
perform
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adele
,
indeed
,
no
sooner
see
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
than
she
summon
her
to
her
sofa
,
and
there
quickly
fill
her
lap
with
the
porcelain
,
the
ivory
,
the
waxen
content
of
her
"
boite
;
"
pour
out
,
meantime
,
explanation
and
rapture
in
such
broken
English
as
she
be
mistress
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
I
have
perform
the
part
of
a
good
host
,
"
pursue
Mr.
Rochester
,
"
put
my
guest
into
the
way
of
amuse
each
other
,
I
ought
to
be
at
liberty
to
attend
to
my
own
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Miss
Eyre
,
draw
your
chair
still
a
little
farther
forward
:
you
be
yet
too
far
back
;
I
can
not
see
you
without
disturb
my
position
in
this
comfortable
chair
,
which
I
have
no
mind
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
as
I
be
bid
,
though
I
would
much
rather
have
remain
somewhat
in
the
shade
;
but
Mr.
Rochester
have
such
a
direct
way
of
give
order
<EOS>
,
it
seem
a
matter
of
course
to
obey
him
promptly
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
in
the
dining
-
room
:
<EOS>
the
lustre
,
which
have
be
light
for
dinner
,
fill
the
room
with
a
festal
breadth
of
light
;
the
large
fire
be
all
red
and
clear
;
the
purple
curtain
hang
rich
and
ample
before
the
lofty
window
and
loftier
arch
;
everything
be
still
,
save
the
subdued
chat
of
Adele
(
she
dare
not
speak
loud
)
,
and
,
fill
up
each
pause
,
the
beating
of
winter
rain
against
the
pane
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
as
he
sit
in
his
damask
-
cover
chair
,
look
different
to
what
I
have
see
him
look
before
;
not
quite
so
stern
 
much
less
gloomy
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
smile
on
his
lip
,
and
his
eye
sparkle
,
whether
with
wine
or
not
,
I
be
not
sure
;
but
I
think
it
very
probable
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
in
short
,
in
his
after
-
dinner
mood
;
more
expanded
and
genial
,
and
also
more
self-
indulgent
than
the
frigid
and
rigid
temper
of
the
morning
;
still
he
look
preciously
grim
,
cushion
his
massive
head
against
the
swelling
back
of
his
chair
,
and
receive
the
light
of
the
fire
on
his
granite-
hewn
feature
,
and
in
his
great
,
dark
eye
;
for
he
have
great
,
dark
eye
,
and
very
fine
eye
,
too
 
not
without
a
certain
change
in
their
depth
sometimes
,
which
,
if
it
be
not
softness
,
remind
you
,
at
least
,
of
that
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
look
two
minute
at
the
fire
,
and
I
have
be
look
the
same
length
of
time
at
him
,
when
,
turn
suddenly
,
he
catch
my
gaze
fasten
on
his
physiognomy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
examine
me
,
Miss
Eyre
,
"
say
he
:
"
do
you
think
me
handsome
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
,
if
I
have
deliberate
,
have
reply
to
this
question
by
something
conventionally
vague
and
polite
;
but
the
answer
somehow
slip
from
my
tongue
before
I
be
aware
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
by
my
word
!
<EOS>
there
be
something
singular
about
you
,
"
say
he
:
"
you
have
the
air
of
a
little
_
nonnette
_
;
quaint
,
quiet
,
grave
,
and
simple
,
as
you
sit
with
your
hand
before
you
,
and
your
eye
generally
bent
on
the
carpet
(
except
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
when
they
be
direct
piercingly
to
my
face
;
as
just
now
,
for
instance
)
;
and
when
one
ask
you
a
question
,
or
make
a
remark
to
which
you
be
oblige
to
reply
,
you
rap
out
a
round
rejoinder
,
which
,
if
not
blunt
,
be
at
least
brusque
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
be
too
plain
;
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
reply
that
it
be
not
easy
to
give
an
impromptu
answer
to
a
question
about
appearance
;
that
taste
mostly
differ
;
and
that
beauty
be
of
little
consequence
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
have
reply
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
beauty
of
little
consequence
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
so
,
under
pretence
of
soften
the
previous
outrage
,
of
stroke
and
soothe
me
into
placidity
,
you
stick
a
sly
penknife
under
my
ear
!
<EOS>
go
on
<EOS>
:
what
fault
do
you
find
with
me
,
pray
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
all
my
limb
and
all
my
feature
like
any
other
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
allow
me
to
disown
my
first
answer
:
I
intend
no
pointed
repartee
:
it
be
only
a
blunder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
so
:
I
think
so
:
<EOS>
and
you
shall
be
answerable
for
it
.
<EOS>
criticise
me
:
do
my
forehead
not
please
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
lift
up
the
sable
wave
of
hair
which
lie
horizontally
over
his
brow
,
and
show
a
solid
enough
mass
of
intellectual
organ
,
but
an
abrupt
deficiency
where
the
suave
sign
of
benevolence
should
have
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
madam
,
be
I
a
fool
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
far
from
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
would
,
perhaps
,
think
me
rude
if
I
inquire
in
return
whether
you
be
a
philanthropist
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
again
!
<EOS>
another
stick
of
the
penknife
,
when
she
pretend
to
pat
my
head
:
and
that
be
because
I
say
I
do
not
like
the
society
of
child
and
old
woman
<EOS>
(
low
be
it
speak
!
)
.
<EOS>
no
,
young
lady
,
I
be
not
a
general
philanthropist
;
but
I
bear
a
conscience
;
"
and
he
point
to
the
prominence
which
be
say
to
indicate
that
faculty
,
and
which
,
fortunately
for
him
,
be
sufficiently
conspicuous
;
give
,
indeed
,
a
mark
breadth
to
the
upper
part
of
his
head
:
"
and
,
besides
,
I
once
have
a
kind
of
rude
tenderness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
as
old
as
you
,
I
be
a
feeling
fellow
enough
,
partial
to
the
unfledged
,
unfostered
,
and
unlucky
;
but
Fortune
have
knock
me
about
since
:
<EOS>
she
have
even
knead
me
with
her
knuckle
,
and
now
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
I
be
hard
and
tough
as
an
India
-
rubber
ball
;
<EOS>
pervious
,
though
,
through
a
chink
or
two
still
,
and
with
one
sentient
point
in
the
middle
of
the
lump
.
<EOS>
yes
:
do
that
leave
hope
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
hope
of
what
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
of
my
final
re
-
transformation
from
India
-
rubber
back
to
flesh
?
"
  
"
decidedly
he
have
have
too
much
wine
,
"
I
think
;
and
I
do
not
know
what
answer
to
make
to
his
queer
question
:
how
could
I
tell
whether
he
be
capable
of
be
re
-
transform
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
very
much
puzzle
,
Miss
Eyre
;
and
though
you
be
not
pretty
any
more
than
I
be
handsome
,
yet
a
puzzle
air
become
you
;
besides
,
it
be
convenient
,
for
it
keep
those
search
eye
of
yours
away
from
my
physiognomy
,
and
busy
them
with
the
worst
flower
of
the
rug
;
so
puzzle
on
.
<EOS>
young
lady
,
I
be
dispose
to
be
gregarious
and
communicative
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
announcement
he
rise
from
his
chair
,
and
stand
,
lean
his
arm
on
the
marble
mantelpiece
:
in
that
attitude
his
shape
be
see
plainly
as
well
as
his
face
;
his
unusual
breadth
of
chest
,
disproportionate
almost
to
his
length
of
limb
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
most
people
would
have
think
him
an
ugly
man
;
yet
there
be
so
much
unconscious
pride
in
his
port
;
so
much
ease
in
his
demeanour
;
such
a
look
of
complete
indifference
to
his
own
external
appearance
;
so
haughty
a
reliance
on
the
power
of
other
quality
,
intrinsic
or
adventitious
,
to
atone
for
the
lack
of
mere
personal
attractiveness
,
that
,
in
look
at
him
,
one
inevitably
share
the
indifference
,
and
,
even
in
a
blind
,
imperfect
sense
,
put
faith
in
the
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
dispose
to
be
gregarious
and
communicative
to
-
night
,
"
he
repeat
,
"
and
that
be
why
I
send
for
you
:
<EOS>
the
fire
and
the
chandelier
be
not
sufficient
company
for
me
;
nor
would
pilot
have
be
,
for
none
of
these
can
talk
.
<EOS>
Adele
be
a
degree
better
,
but
still
far
below
the
mark
;
Mrs.
Fairfax
ditto
;
you
,
I
be
persuade
,
can
suit
me
if
you
will
:
you
puzzle
me
the
first
evening
I
invite
you
down
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
almost
forget
you
since
:
other
idea
have
drive
yours
from
my
head
;
but
to
-
night
I
be
resolve
to
be
at
ease
;
to
dismiss
what
importune
,
and
recall
what
please
.
<EOS>
It
would
please
me
now
to
draw
you
out
 
to
learn
more
of
you
 
therefore
speak
.
"
  
<EOS>
instead
of
speak
,
I
smile
;
and
not
a
very
complacent
or
submissive
smile
either
.

I
sit

nothing

if

bend
his

dive
into

my

absurd

almost
insolent

<EOS>
Miss
Eyre
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
once
for
all
,
I
do
not

to
treat
you
like
an
inferior

that
is

(
correct

I
claim
only
such
superiority
as
must
result
from
twenty
year

difference
in
age

a

advance
in
experience

this

legitimate

as
Adele
would
say
;
and
it
be
by
virtue
of
this
superiority
,
and
this
alone
,
that
I
desire
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
talk
to
me
a
little
now
,
and
divert
my
thought
,
which
be
gall

on

canker

<EOS>
He
have
deign
an
explanation
,
almost
an
apology
,
and
I
do
not
feel
insensible
to
his
condescension
,
and
would
not
seem
so
.
  
<EOS>

I
be
willing
to
amuse
you

if
I

quite

I

how

I

you

ask
me
question

I

my
good

in

do
you
agree
with
me
that
I
have
a
right
to
be
a
little
masterful
,
abrupt
,
perhaps
exact
,
sometimes
,
on
the
ground
I
state
,
namely
,
that
I
be
old
enough
to
be
your
father

and
that
I
have
battle
through
a
varied
experience
with
many
man
of
many
nation

roam
over
half
the

as
you

"

that
be
no

rather
it
be
a
very
irritating
,
because
a
very
evasive
one

reply
clearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
do
not
think
,
sir

you
have
a
right
to
command
me
,
merely
because
you
be
old
than
I
,
or
because
you
have
see
more
of
the
world
than
I
have
;
your
claim
to
superiority
depend
on
the
use
you

of
your

experience

<EOS>

Humph

<EOS>
promptly
speak

I
will
not

that
it

never
suit
my

I
have
make
an
indifferent

not

a
bad

use
of
both
advantage

<EOS>
leave
superiority
out
of
the
question
,
then
,
you
must
still
agree
to
receive
my
order
now
and
then
,
without
be
pique

hurt
by
the
tone
of
command

<EOS>
Will
you
?

<EOS>
I
smile
:
I
think

Mr.

the

instantly
the

expression

speak
too

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
think

that
very
few

trouble
themselves

you

<EOS>
oh
yes
,
I
have
forget
the
salary
!
<EOS>
well
then
,
on
that
mercenary
ground
,
will
you
agree
to
let
me
hector
a
little
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
not
on
that
ground
;
but
,
on
the
ground
that
you
do
forget
it
,
and
that
you
care
whether
or
not
a
dependent
be
comfortable
in
his
dependency
,
I
agree
heartily
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
you
consent
to
dispense
with
a
great
many
conventional
form
and
phrase
,
without
think
that
the
omission
arise
from
insolence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
I
should
never
mistake
informality
for
insolence
:
one
I
rather
like
,
the
other
nothing
free
-
bear
would
submit
to
,
even
for
a
salary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humbug
!
<EOS>
Most
thing
free
-
bear
will
submit
to
anything
for
a
salary
;
therefore
,
keep
to
yourself
,
and
do
not
venture
on
generality
of
which
you
be
intensely
ignorant
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
mentally
shake
hand
with
you
for
your
answer
,
despite
its
inaccuracy
;
and
as
much
for
the
manner
in
which
it
be
say
,
as
for
the
substance
of
the
speech
;
the
manner
be
frank
and
sincere
;
one
do
not
often
see
such
a
manner
:
<EOS>
no
,
on
the
contrary
,
affectation
,
or
coldness
,
or
stupid
,
coarse
-
minded
misapprehension
of
one
's
meaning
be
the
usual
reward
of
candour
.
<EOS>
not
three
in
three
thousand
raw
school
-
girl
-
governess
would
have
answer
me
as
you
have
just
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mean
to
flatter
you
:
if
you
be
cast
in
a
different
mould
to
the
majority
,
it
be
no
merit
of
yours
:
nature
do
it
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
after
all
,
I
go
too
fast
in
my
conclusion
:
for
what
I
yet
know
,
you
may
be
no
well
than
the
rest
;
you
may
have
intolerable
defect
to
counterbalance
your
few
good
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
may
you
,
"
I
think
.
<EOS>
My
eye
meet
his
as
the
idea
cross
my
mind
:
he
seem
to
read
the
glance
,
answer
as
if
its
import
have
be
speak
as
well
as
imagine
    
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
you
be
right
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
have
plenty
of
fault
of
my
own
:
I
know
it
,
and
I
do
not
wish
to
palliate
them
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
God
wot
<EOS>
I
need
not
be
too
severe
about
other
;
I
have
a
past
existence
,
a
series
of
deed
,
a
colour
of
life
to
contemplate
within
my
own
breast
,
which
may
well
call
my
sneer
and
censure
from
my
neighbour
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
start
,
or
rather
(
for
like
other
defaulter
,
I
like
to
lay
half
the
blame
on
ill
fortune
and
adverse
circumstance
)
be
thrust
on
to
a
wrong
tack
at
the
age
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
have
never
recover
the
right
course
since
:
<EOS>
but
I
may
have
be
very
different
;
I
may
have
be
as
good
as
you
 
wise
 
almost
as
stainless
.
<EOS>
I
envy
you
your
peace
of
mind
,
<EOS>
your
clean
conscience
,
your
unpolluted
memory
.
<EOS>
little
girl
,
a
memory
without
blot

be
an
exquisite
treasure
 
an
inexhaustible
source
of
pure
refreshment

it

your
memory

eighteen

sir

all
right
then
;
limpid
,
salubrious
:
no
gush
of
bilge
water
have
turn
it
to
fetid
puddle

<EOS>
I
be
your
equal

eighteen
 
quite
your

me
to
be
,
on
the
whole

a
good
man

Miss
Eyre

one
of
the
well
kind
,
<EOS>
and
you
see
I
be
not
so

<EOS>
You
would
say
you
do
not
see
it
;
at
least
I
flatter
myself
I
read
as
much
in
your
eye
(
beware

the

what
you
express

quick

its

.
<EOS>
then
take
my
word
for
it
,
 
I
be
not
a
villain
:
you
be
not
to
suppose
that
 
not
to
attribute
to
me
any
such
bad
eminence
;
but
,
owe
,
I
verily
believe
,
rather
to
circumstance
than
to
my
natural
bent
,
I
be
a
trite
commonplace
sinner
,
hackneye
in
all
the
poor
petty
dissipation
with
which
the
rich
and
worthless
try
to
put
on
life
.
<EOS>
do
you
wonder
that
I
avow
this
to
you
?
<EOS>
know
,
that
in
the
course
of
your
future
life
you
will
often
find
yourself
elect
the
involuntary
confidant
of
your
acquaintance
'
secret
:
<EOS>
people
will
instinctively
find
out
,
as
I
have
do
,
that
it
be
not
your
forte
to
tell
of
yourself
,
but
to
listen
while
other
talk
of
themselves
;
they
will
feel
,
too
,
that
you
listen
with
no
malevolent
scorn
of
their
indiscretion
,
but
with
a
kind
of
innate
sympathy
;
not
the
less
comforting
and
encouraging
because
it
be
very
unobtrusive
in
its
manifestation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
guess
all
this
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
well
;
therefore
I
proceed
almost
as
freely
as
if
I
be
write
my
thought
in
a
diary

<EOS>
You
would
say
,
I
should
have
be
superior

so
I
should
 
<EOS>
so
I

you
see
I
be
not

<EOS>
when
fate
wrong
me

I
have
not
the
wisdom
to
remain
cool
:
<EOS>
I
turn
desperate
;
then
I
degenerate

<EOS>
now
,
when
any
vicious
simpleton

my
disgust
by
his
paltry
ribaldry

I
can
not
flatter
myself
that
I

Lowood

cling

speak

freely

move

quickly

but
,
in
time
,
I
think
you
will
learn
to
be
natural
with
me

I
find
it
impossible
to
be
conventional

your

an
odour

float

to

under
his

Wild

the

another

something
hard

cynical

his

his

She

one
of
those

Macbeth

"
You

,

her

in
the

a

with

cry
harshly
;

<EOS>
continue
then
to
pursue
his
walk
in
silence
,
I
venture
to
recall
him
to
the
point
<EOS>
whence
he
have
abruptly
diverge
    
<EOS>
"
do

I
ask

<EOS>
I
almost
expect
a
rebuff
for
this
hardly
well
-
time
question
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
wake
out
of
his
scowling
abstraction
,
he
turn
his
eye
towards
me
,
and
the
shade
seem
to
clear
off
his
brow

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
have

Celine

<EOS>
well
,
to
resume

<EOS>
when
I
see
my
charmer
thus
come
in
accompany
by
a
cavalier
,
I
seem
to
hear
a
hiss
,
and
the
green
snake
of
jealousy
,
rise
on
undulate
coil
from
the
moonlit
balcony
,
glide
within
my
waistcoat
,
and
eat
its
way
in
two
minute
to
my
heart
's
core
.
<EOS>
strange
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
suddenly
start
again
from
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
strange
that
I
should
choose
you
for
the
confidant
of
all
this
,
young
lady
;
pass
strange
that
you
should
listen
to
me
quietly
,
as
if
it
be
the
most
usual
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
like
me
to
tell
story
of
his
opera
-
mistresse
to
a
quaint
,
inexperienced
girl
like
you
!
<EOS>
but
the
last
singularity
explain
the
first
,
as
I
intimate
once
before
:
you
,
with
your
gravity
,
considerateness
,
and
caution
be
make
to
be
the
recipient
of
secret
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
know
what
sort
of
a
mind
I
have
place
in
communication
with
my
own
:
I
know
it
be
one
not
liable
to
take
infection
<EOS>
:
it
be
a
peculiar
mind
:
it
be
a
unique
one
.
<EOS>
happily
I
do
not
mean
to
harm
it
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
do
,
it
would
not
take
harm
from
me
.
<EOS>
the
more
you
and
I
converse
,
the
well
;
for
while
I
can
not
blight
you
,
you
may
refresh
me
.
"
<EOS>
after
this
digression
he
proceed
    
<EOS>
"
I
remain
in
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
come
to
her
boudoir
,
no
doubt
,

think
I
:
"
let
me
prepare
an
ambush
.
"
<EOS>
so
put
my
hand
in
through
the
open
window
,
I
draw
the
curtain
over
it
,
leave
only
an
opening
through
which
I
could
take
observation
;
then
I
close
the
casement
,
all
but
a
chink
just
wide
enough
to
furnish
an
outlet
to
lover
'
whisper
vow
:
then
I
steal
back
to
my
chair
;
and
as
I
resume
it
the
pair
come
in
.
<EOS>
My
eye
be
quickly
at
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
Celine
's
chamber
-
maid
enter
,
light
a
lamp
,
leave
it
on
the
table
,
and
withdraw
.
<EOS>
the
couple
be
thus
reveal
to
me
clearly
:
both
remove
their
cloak
,
and
there
be
"
the
Varens
,
"
shine
in
satin
and
jewel
,
 
my
gift
of
course
,
 
and
there
be
her
companion
in
an
officer
's
uniform
;
and
I
know
him
for
a
young
roue
of
a
vicomte
 
a
brainless
and
vicious
youth
whom
I
have
sometimes
meet
in
society
,
and
have
never
think
of
hate
because
I
despise
him
so
absolutely
.
<EOS>
on
recognise
him
,
the
fang
of
the
snake
Jealousy
be
instantly
break
;
because
at
the
same
moment
my
love
for
Celine
sink
under
an
extinguisher
.
<EOS>
a
woman
who
could
betray
me
for
such
a
rival
be
not
worth
contend
for
;
she
deserve
<EOS>
only
scorn
;
less
,
however
,
than
I
,
who
have
be
her
dupe
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
begin
to
talk
;
their
conversation
ease
me
completely
:
frivolous
,
mercenary
,
heartless
,
and
senseless
,
it
be
rather
calculate
to
weary
than
enrage
a
listener
.
<EOS>
a
card
of
mine
lie
on
the
table
;
this
be
perceive
,
bring
my
name
under
discussion
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them
possess
energy
or
wit
to
belabour
me
soundly
,
but
they
insult
me
as
coarsely
as
they
could
in
their
little
way
:
especially
Celine
,
who
even
wax
rather
brilliant
on
my
personal
defect
 
deformity
she
term
them
.
<EOS>
now
it
have
be
her
custom
to
launch
out
into
fervent
admiration
of
what
she
call
my
"
_
beaute
male
_
:
"
wherein
she
differ
diametrically
from
you
,
who
tell
me
point
-
blank
,
at
the
second
interview
,
that
you
do
not
think
me
handsome
.
<EOS>
the
contrast
strike
me
at
the
time
and
 
"
  
Adele
here
come
run
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
John
have
just
be
to
say
that
your
agent
have
call
and
wish
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
in
that
case
I
must
abridge
.
<EOS>
open
the
window
,
I
walk
in
upon
them
;
liberate
Celine
from
my
protection
;
give
her
notice
to
vacate
her
hotel
;
offer
her
a
purse
for
immediate
exigency
;
disregard
scream
,
hysteric
,
prayer
,
protestation
,
convulsion
;
make
an
appointment
with
the
vicomte
for
a
meeting
at
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
next
morning
I
have
the
pleasure
of
encounter
him
;
leave
a
bullet
in
one
of
his
poor
etiolate
arm
,
feeble
as
the
wing
of
a
chicken
in
the
pip
,
and
then
think
I
have
do
with
the
whole
crew
.
<EOS>
but
unluckily
the
Varens
,
six
month
before
,
have
give
me
this
filette
Adele
,
who
,
she
affirm
,
be
my
daughter
;
and
perhaps
she
may
be
,
though
I
see
no
proof
of
such
grim
paternity
write
in
her
countenance
:
pilot
be
more
like
me
than
she
.
<EOS>
some
year
after
I
have
break
with
the
mother
,
she
abandon
her
child
,
and
run
away
to
Italy
with
a
musician
or
singer
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
no
natural
claim
on
Adele
's
part
to
be
support
by
me
,
nor
do
I
now
acknowledge
any
,
for
I
be
not
her
father
;
but
hear
that
she
be
quite
destitute
,
I
e'en
take
the
poor
thing
out
of
the
slime
and
mud
of
Paris
,
and
transplant
it
here
,
to
grow
up
clean
in
the
wholesome
soil
of
an
english
country
garden
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
find
you
to
train
it
;
but
now
you
know
that
it
be
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
a
french
opera
-
girl
,
you
will
perhaps
think
differently
of
your
post
and
protegee
:
you
will
be
come
to
me
some
day
with
notice
that
you
have
find
another
place
 
that
you
beg
me
to
look
out
for
a
new
governess
,
&
c.
 
Eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
:
Adele
be
not
answerable
for
either
her
mother
's
fault
or
your
:
I
have
a
regard
for
her
;
and
now
that
I
know
she
be
,
in
a
sense
,
parentless
 
forsake
by
her
mother
and
disown
by
you
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
shall
cling
closer
to
her
than
before
.
<EOS>
how
could
I
possibly
prefer
the
spoilt
pet
of
a
wealthy
family
,
who
would
hate
her
governess
as
a
nuisance
,
to
a
lonely
little
orphan
,
who
lean
towards
her
as
a
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
be
the
light
in
which
you
view
it
!
<EOS>
well
,
I
must
go
in
now
;
and
you
too
:
it
darken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
stay
out
a
few
minute
longer
with
<EOS>
Adele
and
Pilot
 
run
a
race
with
her
,
and
play
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
.
<EOS>
when
we
go
in
,
and
I
have
remove
her
bonnet
and
coat
<EOS>
,
I
take
her
on
my
knee
;
keep
her
there
an
hour
,
allow
her
to
prattle
as
she
like
:
not
rebuke
even
some
little
freedom
and
triviality
into
which
she
be
apt
to
stray
when
much
noticed
,
and
which
betray
in
her
a
superficiality
of
character
,
inherit
probably
from
her
mother
,
hardly
congenial
to
an
english
mind
.
<EOS>
still
she
have
her
merit
;
and
I
be
dispose
to
appreciate
all
that
be
good
in
her
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
I
seek
in
her
countenance
and
feature
a
likeness
to
Mr.
Rochester
,
but
find
none
:
<EOS>
no
trait
,
no
turn
of
expression
announce
relationship
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
:
if
she
could
but
have
be
prove
to
resemble
him
,
he
would
have
think
more
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
after
I
have
withdraw
to
my
own
chamber
for
the
night
,
that
I
steadily
review
the
tale
Mr.
Rochester
have
tell
me
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
say
,
there
be
probably
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
the
substance
of
the
narrative
itself
:
a
wealthy
Englishman
's
passion
for
a
french
dancer
,
and
her
treachery
to
him
,
be
every
-
day
matter
enough
,
no
doubt
,
in
society
;
but
there
be
something
decidedly
strange
in
the
paroxysm
of
emotion
which
have
suddenly
seize
him
when
he
be
in
the
act
of
express
the
present
contentment
of
his
mood
,
and
his
newly
revive
pleasure
in
the
old
hall
and
its
environ
.
<EOS>
I
meditate
wonderingly
on
this
incident
;
but
gradually
quit
it
,
as
I
find
it
for
the
present
inexplicable
,
I
turn
to
the
consideration
of
my
master
's
manner
to
myself
.
<EOS>
the
confidence
he
have
think
fit
to
repose
in
me
seem
a
tribute
to
my
discretion
:
I
regard
and
accept
it
as
such
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
have
now
for
some
week
be
more
uniform
towards
me
than
at
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
never
seem
in
his
way
;
he
do
not
take
fit
of
chill
hauteur
:
when
he
meet
me
unexpectedly
,
the
encounter
seem
welcome
;
he
have
always
a
word
and
sometimes
a
smile
for
me
:
when
summon
by
formal
invitation
to
his
presence
,
I
be
honour
by
a
cordiality
of
reception
that
make
me
feel
I
really
possess
the
power
to
amuse
him
,
and
that
these
evening
conference
be
seek
as
much
for
his
pleasure
as
for
my
benefit
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
indeed
,
talk
comparatively
little
,
but
I
hear
him
talk
with
relish
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
nature
to
be
communicative
;
he
like
to
open
to
a
mind
unacquainted
with
the
world
glimpse
of
its
scene
and
way
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
mean
its
corrupt
scene
and
wicked
way
,
but
such
as
derive
their
interest
from
the
great
scale
on
which
they
be
act
,
the
strange
novelty
by
which
they
be
characterise
)
;
and
I
have
a
keen
delight
in
receive
the
new
idea
he
offer
,
in
imagine
the
new
picture
he
portray
,
and
follow
him
in
thought
through
the
new
region
he
disclose
,
never
startle
or
trouble
by
one
noxious
allusion
.
  
<EOS>
the
ease
of
his
manner
free
me
from
painful
restraint
:
the
friendly
frankness
,
as
correct
as
cordial
,
with
which
he
treat
me
,
draw
me
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
feel
at
time
as
if
he
be
my
relation
rather
than
my
master
:
yet
he
be
imperious
sometimes
still
;
but
I
do
not
mind
that
<EOS>
;
I
see
it
be
his
way
.
<EOS>
so
happy
,
so
gratified
<EOS>
do
I
become
with
this
new
interest
add
to
life
,
that
I
cease
to
pine
after
kindred
:
my
thin
crescent
-
destiny
seem
to
enlarge
;
the
blank
of
existence
be
fill
up
;
my
bodily
health
improve
;
I
gather
flesh
and
strength
.
  
<EOS>
and
be
Mr.
Rochester
now
ugly
in
my
eye
?
<EOS>
no
,
reader
:
gratitude
,
and
many
association
,
<EOS>
all
pleasurable
and
genial
,
make
his
face
the
object
I
best
like
to
see
;
his
presence
in
a
room
be
more
cheering
than
the
bright
fire
.
<EOS>
yet
I
have
not
forget
his
fault
;
indeed
,
I
could
not
,
for
he
bring
them
frequently
before
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
proud
,
sardonic
,
harsh
to
inferiority
of
every
description
:
in
my
secret
soul
I
know
that
his
great
kindness
to
me
be
balance
by
unjust
severity
to
many
other
.
<EOS>
He
be
moody
,
too
;
unaccountably
so
;
I
more
than
once
,
when
send
for
to
read
to
him
,
find
him
sit
in
his
library
alone
,
with
his
head
bent
on
his
fold
arm
;
and
,
when
he
look
up
,
a
morose
,
almost
a
malignant
,
scowl
blacken
his
feature
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
that
his
moodiness
,
his
harshness
,
and
his
former
fault
of
morality
(
I
say
_
former
_
,
for
now
he
seem
correct
of
them
)
have
their
source
in
some
cruel
cross
of
fate
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
naturally
a
man
of
well
tendency
,
high
principle
,
and
purer
taste
than
such
as
circumstance
have
develop
,
education
instill
,
or
destiny
encourage
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
excellent
material
in
him
;
though
for
the
present
they
hang
together
somewhat
spoil
and
tangle
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
deny
that
I
grieve
for
his
grief
,
whatever
that
be
,
and
would
have
give
much
to
assuage
it
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
have
now
extinguish
my
candle
and
be
lay
down
in
bed
,
I
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
his
look
when
he
pause
in
the
avenue
,
and
tell
how
his
destiny
have
rise
up
before
him
,
and
dare
him
to
be
happy
at
Thornfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
alienate
him
from
the
house
?
<EOS>
Will
he
leave
it
again
soon
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
say
he
seldom
stay
here
longer
than
a
fortnight
at
a
time
;
and
he
have
now
be
resident
eight
week
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
go
,
the
change
will
be
doleful
.
<EOS>
suppose
he
should
be
absent
spring
,
summer
,
and
autumn
:
how
joyless
sunshine
and
fine
day
will
seem
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
whether
I
have
sleep
or
not
after
this
musing
;
at
any
rate
,
I
start
wide
awake
on
hear
a
vague
murmur
,
peculiar
and
lugubrious
,
which
sound
,
I
think
,
just
above
me
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
keep
my
candle
burning
:
the
night
be
drearily
dark
;
my
spirit
be
depressed
.
<EOS>
I
rise
and
sit
up
in
bed
,
listen
.
<EOS>
the
sound
be
hush
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
again
to
sleep
;
but
my
heart
beat
anxiously
:
my
inward
tranquillity
be
break
.
<EOS>
the
clock
,
far
down
in
the
hall
,
strike
two
.
<EOS>
just
then
it
seem
my
chamber
-
door
be
touch
;
as
if
finger
have
sweep
the
panel
in
grope
a
way
along
the
dark
gallery
outside
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
who
be
there
?
"
<EOS>
nothing
answer
.
<EOS>
I
be
chill
with
fear
.
  
<EOS>
all
at
once
I
remember
that
it
may
be
pilot
,
who
,
when
the
kitchen-
door
chance
to
be
leave
open
,
not
unfrequently
find
his
way
up
to
the
threshold
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
<EOS>
:
I
have
see
him
lie
there
myself
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
idea
calm
me
somewhat
:
I
lie
down
.
<EOS>
silence
compose
the
nerve
;
and
as
an
unbroken
hush
now
reign
again
through
the
whole
house
,
I
begin
to
feel
the
return
of
slumber
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
fate
that
I
should
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
a
dream
have
scarcely
approach
my
ear
,
when
it
flee
affright
,
scare
by
a
marrow
-
freeze
incident
enough
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
demoniac
laugh
 
<EOS>
low
,
suppress
,
and
deep
 
utter
,
as
it
seem
,
at
the
very
keyhole
of
my
chamber
door
.
<EOS>
the
head
of
my
bed
be
near
the
door
,
and
I
think
at
first
<EOS>
the
goblin
-
laugher
stand
at
my
bedside
 
or
rather
,
crouch
by
my
pillow
:
but
I
rise
,
look
round
,
and
could
see
nothing
;
while
,
as
I
still
gaze
,
the
unnatural
sound
be
reiterate
:
and
I
know
it
come
from
behind
the
panel
.
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
be
to
rise
and
fasten
the
bolt
;
my
next
,
again
to
cry
out
,
"
who
be
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
something
gurgle
and
moan
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
step
retreat
up
the
gallery
towards
the
third
-
storey
staircase
:
a
door
have
lately
be
make
to
shut
in
that
staircase
;
I
hear
it
open
and
close
,
and
all
be
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
Grace
Poole
?
<EOS>
and
be
she
possess
with
a
devil
?
<EOS>
"
think
I.
Impossible
now
to
remain
longer
by
myself
:
I
must
go
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
I
hurry
on
my
frock
and
a
shawl
;
I
withdraw
the
bolt
and
open
the
door
with
a
tremble
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
candle
burn
just
outside
,
and
on
the
matting
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
at
this
circumstance
:
but
still
more
be
I
amazed
to
perceive
the
air
quite
dim
,
as
if
fill
with
smoke
;
and
,
while
look
to
the
right
hand
and
leave
,
to
find
whence
these
blue
wreath
issue
,
I
become
further
aware
of
a
strong
smell
of
burn
.
  
<EOS>
something
creak
:
it
be
a
door
ajar
;
and
that
door
be
Mr.
Rochester
's
,
and
the
smoke
rush
in
a
cloud
from
thence
.
<EOS>
I
think
no
more
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
;
I
think
no
more
of
Grace
Poole
,
or
the
laugh
:
in
an
instant
,
I
be
within
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
tongue
of
flame
dart
round
the
bed
:
the
curtain
be
on
fire
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
blaze
and
vapour
,
Mr.
Rochester
lie
stretch
motionless
,
in
deep
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
wake
!
<EOS>
wake
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
<EOS>
I
shake
him
,
but
he
only
murmur
and
turn
:
the
smoke
have
stupefy
him
.
<EOS>
not
a
moment
could
be
lose
:
the
very
sheet
be
kindle
,
I
rush
to
his
basin
and
ewer
;
fortunately
,
one
be
wide
and
the
other
deep
,
and
both
be
fill
with
water
.
<EOS>
I
heave
them
up
,
deluge
the
bed
and
its
occupant
,
fly
back
to
my
own
room
,
bring
my
own
water
-
jug
,
baptize
the
couch
afresh
,
and
,
by
God
's
aid
,
succeed
in
extinguish
the
flame
which
be
devour
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
hiss
of
the
quench
element
,
the
breakage
of
a
pitcher
which
I
fling
from
my
hand
when
I
have
empty
it
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
splash
of
the
shower
-
bath
I
have
liberally
bestow
,
rouse
Mr.
Rochester
at
last
.
<EOS>
though
it
be
now
dark
,
I
know
he
be
awake
;
because
I
hear
him
fulminate
strange
anathema
at
find
himself
lie
in
a
pool
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
a
flood
?
"
<EOS>
he
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

sir
<EOS>

"
I
answer
;
"
but
there
have
be
a

"
what

I

in
Heaven

somebody

plot
something
:
you
can
not
too
soon
find
out
who

what
it

"
  
<EOS>

there

<EOS>
I
be
up
now
;
but
at
your
peril
you
fetch
a
candle
yet
:
<EOS>
wait
two
minute
till
I
get
into
some
dry
garment
,
if
any
dry
there
be
 
<EOS>
yes
,
here

my
dressing
-
gown
.
<EOS>
now
run

"
  
<EOS>
I
do
run
;
I
bring
the
candle
which
still
remain
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
He
take
it
from
my
hand
,
hold
it
up
,
and
survey
the
bed
,
all
blacken
and
scorch
,
the
sheet
drench
,
the
carpet
round
swimming
in
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
and
who
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
.
<EOS>
I
briefly
relate
to
him
what
have
transpire
:
the
strange
laugh
I
have
hear
in
the
gallery
:
the
step
ascend
to
the
third
storey
;
the
smoke
,
 
the
smell
of
fire
which
have
conduct
me
to
his
room
;
in
what
state
I
have
find
matter
there
,
and
how
I
have
deluge
him
with
all
the
water
I
could
lay
hand
on
.
  
<EOS>
{
"
what
be
it
and
who
do
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
:
p140.jpg
}
  
<EOS>
He
listen
very
gravely
;
his
face
,
as
I
go
on
,
express
more
concern
than
astonishment
;
he
do
not
immediately
speak
when
I
have
conclude
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
call
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
no
;
what
the
deuce
would
you
call
her
for
?
<EOS>
what
can
she
do
?
<EOS>
let
her
sleep
unmoleste
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
fetch
Leah
,
and
wake
John
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
:
just
be
still
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
shawl
on
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
not
warm
enough
,
you
may
take
my
cloak
yonder
;
wrap
it
about
you
,
and
sit
down
in
the
arm
-
chair
:
there
,
 
I
will
put
it
on
.
<EOS>
now
place
your
foot
on
the
stool
,
to
keep
them
out
of
the
wet
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
leave
you
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
the
candle
.
<EOS>
remain
where
you
be
till
I
return
;
be
as
still
as
a
mouse
.
<EOS>
I
must
pay
a
visit
to
the
second
storey
.
<EOS>
do
not
move
,
remember
,
or
call
any
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
:
<EOS>
I
watch
the
light
withdraw
.
<EOS>
He
pass
up
the
gallery
very
softly
,
unclose
the
staircase
door
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
shut
it
after
him
,
and
the
last
ray
vanish
.
<EOS>
I
be
leave
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
listen
for
some
noise
,
but
hear
nothing
.
<EOS>
a
very
long
time
elapse
.
<EOS>
I
grow
weary
:
<EOS>
it
be
cold
,
in
spite
of
the
cloak
;
and
then
I
do
not
see
the
use
of
stay
,
as
I
be
not
to
rouse
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
be
on
the
point
of
risk
Mr.
Rochester
's
displeasure
by
disobey
his
order
,
when
the
light
once
more
gleamed
dimly
on
the
gallery
wall
,
and
I
hear
his
unshod
foot
tread
the
matting
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
be
he
,
"
think
I
,
"
and
not
something
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
re
-
entered
,
pale
and
very
gloomy
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
find
it
all
out
,
"
say
he
,
set
his
candle
down
on
the
washstand
;
"
it
be
as
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
make
no
reply
,
but
stand
with
his
arm
fold
,
look
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
a
few
minute
he
inquire
in
rather
a
peculiar
tone
    
<EOS>
"
I
forget
whether
you
say
you
see
anything
when
you
open
your
chamber
door

<EOS>
"
  
"
no

sir

only
the
candlestick
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
hear
an
odd
laugh
?
<EOS>
You
have
hear
that
laugh
before
,
I
should
think
,
or
something
like
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

sir

there
be
a
woman
who
sew
here

call
Grace

that
way

"
<EOS>
just
so
.
<EOS>
Grace
Poole
 
you
have
guess
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
as
you
say
,
singular
 
very
.
<EOS>
well

I
shall
reflect
on
the
subject

<EOS>
meantime

I
be
glad
that
you
be
the
only
person
,
besides
myself

acquaint
with
the
precise
detail
of
to

night
's
incident
.
<EOS>
You
be
no
talk
fool
:
say
nothing
about
it

<EOS>
I
will
account
for
this
state
of
affair

(
point
to
the
bed
)
:
"
and
now
return
to
your
own
room

<EOS>
I
shall
do
very
well
on

sofa
in

library

the
rest
of
the
night

It
be
near
four

up

good

night

I

He
seem
surprised
 
very
inconsistently
so
,
as
he
have
just
tell
me
to
go

<EOS>

what

he
exclaim

in

<EOS>
"
You

may
go

not
without
take
leave

not
without
a
word

two
of
acknowledgment

good

not

in

in

dry

excruciating

past
me
as

<EOS>
at
least
shake
hand

<EOS>
He
hold
out
his
hand
;
I
give
him
mine
:
he
take
it
first
in
one
,
them
in
both
his
own

"
You
have
save
my
life

I
have
a
pleasure
in
owe
you
so
immense
a
debt

I
can
not

nothing

be
different

I
feel
your
benefit
no

He
pause
;
gaze
at

almost
visible
tremble

"
  
<EOS>
"
cold
?
<EOS>
yes
,
 
and
stand
in
a
pool
!
<EOS>
go
,
then
,
Jane
;
go
!
"
<EOS>
but
he
still
retain
my
hand
,
and
I
could
not
free
it
.
<EOS>
I
bethink
myself
of
an
expedient
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
hear
Mrs.
Fairfax
move
,
sir
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
leave
me
:
"
he
relax
his
finger
,
and
I
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
regain
my
couch
,
but
never
think
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
till
morning
dawn
I
be
toss
on
a
buoyant
but
unquiet
sea
,
where
billow
of
trouble
roll
under
surge
of
joy
.
<EOS>
I
think
sometimes
I
see
beyond
its
wild
water
a
shore
,
sweet
as
the
hill
of
Beulah
;
and
now
and
then
a
freshen
gale
,
waken
by
hope
,
bore
my
spirit
triumphantly
towards
the
bourne
:
but
I
could
not
reach
it
,
even
in
fancy
 
<EOS>
a
counteracting
breeze
blow
off
land
,
and
continually
drive
me
back
.
<EOS>
sense
would
resist
delirium
:
judgment
would
warn
passion
.
<EOS>
too
feverish
to
rest
,
I
rise
as
soon
as
day
dawn
.
    
<EOS>
I
both
wish
and
fear
to
see
Mr.
Rochester
on
the
day
which
follow
this
sleepless
night
:
I
want
to
hear
his
voice
again
,
yet
fear
to
meet
his
eye
.
<EOS>
during
the
early
part
of
the
morning
,
I
momentarily
expect
his
coming
;
he
be
not
in
the
frequent
habit
of
enter
the
schoolroom
,
but
he
do
step
in
for
a
few
minute
sometimes
,
and
I
have
the
impression
that
he
be
sure
to
visit
it
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
morning
pass
just
as
usual
:
nothing
happen
to
interrupt
the
quiet
course
of
Adele
's
study
;
only
soon
after
breakfast
,
I
hear
some
bustle
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
voice
,
and
Leah
's
,
and
the
cook
's
 
that
is
,
John
's
wife
 
and
even
John
's
own
gruff
tone
.
<EOS>
there
be
exclamation
of
"
what
a
mercy
master
be
not
burn
in
his
bed
!
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
always
dangerous
to
keep
a
candle
light
at
night
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
providential
that
he
have
presence
of
mind
to
think
of
the
water
-
jug
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
he
wake
nobody
!
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
be
hope
he
will
not
take
cold
with
sleep
on
the
library
sofa
,
"
&
c.
  
<EOS>
to
much
confabulation
succeed
a
sound
of
scrubbing
and
set
to
right
;
and
when
I
pass
the
room
,
in
go
downstairs
to
dinner
,
I
see
through
the
open
door
that
all
be
again
restore
to
complete
order
;
only
the
bed
be
strip
of
its
hanging
.
<EOS>
Leah
stand
up
in
the
window
-
seat
,
rub
the
pane
of
glass
dim
with
smoke
.
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
address
her
,
for
I
wish
to
know
what
account
have
be
give
of
the
affair
:
but
,
on
advance
,
I
see
a
second
person
in
the
chamber
 
<EOS>
a
woman
sit
on
a
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
sewing
ring
to
new
curtain
.
<EOS>
that
woman
be
no
other
than
Grace
Poole
.
  
<EOS>
there
she
sit
,
staid
and
taciturn
-
look
,
as
usual
,
in
her
brown
stuff
gown
,
her
check
apron
,
white
handkerchief
,
and
cap
.
<EOS>
She
be
intent
on
her
work
,
in
which
her
whole
thought
seem
absorb
:
on
her
hard
forehead
,
and
in
her
commonplace
feature
,
be
nothing
either
of
the
paleness
or
desperation
<EOS>
one
would
have
expect
to
see
mark
the
countenance
of
a
woman
who
have
attempt
murder
,
and
whose
intend
victim
have
follow
her
last
night
to
her
lair
,
and
(
as
I
believe
)
,
charge
her
with
the
crime
she
wish
to
perpetrate
.
<EOS>
I
be
amazed
 
confound
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
,
while
I
still
gaze
at
her
:
<EOS>
no
start
,
no
increase
or
failure
of
colour
betray
emotion
,
consciousness
of
guilt
,
or
fear
of
detection
.
<EOS>
She
say
"
good
morning
,
Miss
,
"
in
her
usual
phlegmatic
and
brief
manner
;
and
take
up
another
ring
and
more
tape
,
go
on
with
her
sewing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
her
to
some
test
,
"
think
I
:
"
such
absolute
impenetrability
be
past
comprehension
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
morning
,
grace
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
have
anything
happen
here
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
hear
the
servant
all
talk
together
a
while
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
only
master
have
be
read
in
his
bed
last
night
;
he
fall
asleep
with
his
candle
lit
,
and
the
curtain
get
on
fire
;
but
,
fortunately
,
he
awake
before
the
bed
-
clothe
or
the
wood
-
work
catch
,
and
contrive
to
quench
the
flame
with
the
water
in
the
ewer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
strange
affair
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
in
a
low
voice
:
then
,
look
at
her
fixedly
 
"
do
Mr.
Rochester
wake
nobody
?
<EOS>
do
no
one
hear
him
move
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
again
raise
her
eye
to
me
,
and
this
time
there
be
something
of
consciousness
in
their
expression
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
examine
me
warily
;
then
she
answer
    
"
the
servant
sleep
so
far
off
,
you
know
,
Miss
,
they
would
not
be
likely
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
and
yours
be
the
near
to
master
's
;
but
Mrs.
Fairfax
say
she
hear
nothing
:
when
people
get
elderly
,
they
often
sleep
heavy
.
"
<EOS>
She
pause
,
and
then
add
,
with
a
sort
of
assumed
indifference
,
but
still
in
a
marked
and
significant
tone
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
young
,
Miss
;
and
I
should
say
a
light
sleeper
<EOS>
:
perhaps
you
may
have
hear
a
noise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
say
I
,
drop
my
voice
,
so
that
Leah
,
who
be
still
polish
the
pane
,
could
not
hear
me
,
"
and
at
first
I
think
it
be
pilot
:
<EOS>
but
pilot
can
not
laugh
;
and
I
be
certain
I
hear
a
laugh
,
and
a
strange
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
a
new
needleful
of
thread
,
wax
it
carefully
,
thread
her
needle
with
a
steady
hand
,
and
then
observe
,
with
perfect
composure
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
hardly
likely
master
would
laugh
,
I
should
think
,
Miss
,
when
he
be
in
such
danger
:
You
must
have
be
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
dream
,
"
I
say
,
with
some
warmth
,
for
her
brazen
coolness
provoke
me
.
<EOS>
again
she
look
at
me
;
and
with
the
same
scrutinising
and
conscious
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
tell
master
that
you
hear
a
laugh
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
have
the
opportunity
of
speak
to
him
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
think
of
open
your
door
and
look
out
into
the
gallery
?
<EOS>
"
she
further
ask
.
  
<EOS>
She
appear
to
be
cross
-
question
me
,
attempt
to
draw
from
me
<EOS>
information
unawares
.
<EOS>
the
idea
strike
me
that
if
she
discover
I
know
or
suspect
her
guilt
,
she
would
be
play
of
some
of
her
malignant
prank
on
me
;
I
think
it
advisable
to
be
on
my
guard
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
bolt
my
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
not
in
the
habit
of
bolt
your
door
every
night
before
you
get
into
bed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fiend
!
<EOS>
she
want
to
know
my
habit
,
that
she
may
lay
her
plan
accordingly
!
"
<EOS>
indignation
again
prevail
over
prudence
:
I
reply
sharply
,
"
Hitherto
I
have
often
omit
to
fasten
the
bolt
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
any
danger
or
annoyance
be
to
be
dread
at
Thornfield
Hall
:
but
in
future
"
(
and
I
lay
marked
stress
on
the
word
)
"
I
shall
take
good
care
to
make
all
secure
before
I
venture
to
lie
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
wise
so
to
do
,
"
be
her
answer
:
"
this
neighbourhood
be
as
quiet
as
any
I
know
,
and
I
never
hear
of
the
hall
be
attempt
by
robber
since
it
be
a
house
;
though
there
be
hundred
of
pound
'
worth
of
plate
in
the
plate
-
closet
,
as
be
well
known
.
<EOS>
and
you
see
,
for
such
a
large
house
,
there
be
very
few
servant
,
because
master
have
never
live
here
much
;
and
when
he
do
come
,
be
a
bachelor
,
he
need
little
wait
on
:
<EOS>
but
I
always
think
it
best
to
err
on
the
safe
side
;
a
door
be
soon
fasten
,
and
it
be
as
well
to
have
a
draw
bolt
between
one
and
any
mischief
that
may
be
about
.
<EOS>
a
deal
of
people
,
Miss
,
be
for
trust
all
to
Providence
;
but
I
say
Providence
will
not
dispense
with
the
mean
,
though
He
often
bless
them
when
they
be
use
discreetly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
here
she
close
her
harangue
:
a
long
one
for
her
,
and
utter
with
the
demureness
of
a
Quakeress
.
  
<EOS>
I
still
stand
absolutely
dumfoundere
at
what
appear
to
me
her
miraculous
self
-
possession
and
most
inscrutable
hypocrisy
,
when
the
cook
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Poole
,
"
say
she
,
address
grace
,
"
the
servant
'
dinner
will
soon
be
ready
:
will
you
come
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
just
put
my
pint
of
porter
and
bit
of
pudde
on
a
tray
,
and
I
will
carry
it
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
some
meat
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
just
a
morsel
,
and
a
taste
of
cheese
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
sago
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
it
at
present
:
I
shall
be
come
down
before
teatime
:
I
will
make
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
cook
here
turn
to
me
,
say
that
Mrs.
Fairfax
be
wait
for
me
:
so
I
depart
.
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
hear
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
account
of
the
curtain
conflagration
during
dinner
,
so
much
be
I
occupy
in
puzzle
my
brain
over
the
enigmatical
character
of
Grace
Poole
,
and
still
more
in
ponder
the
problem
of
her
position
at
Thornfield
and
question
why
she
have
not
be
give
into
custody
that
morning
,
or
,
at
the
very
least
,
dismiss
from
her
master
's
service
.
<EOS>
He
have
almost
as
much
as
declare
his
conviction
of
her
criminality
last
night
:
what
mysterious
cause
withhold
him
from
accuse
her
?
<EOS>
why
have
he
enjoin
me
,
too
,
to
secrecy
?
<EOS>
It
be
strange
:
a
bold
,
vindictive
,
and
haughty
gentleman
seem
somehow
in
the
power
of
one
of
the
mean
of
his
dependant
;
so
much
in
her
power
,
that
even
when
she
lift
her
hand
against
his
life
,
he
dare
not
openly
charge
her
with
the
attempt
,
much
less
punish
her
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
grace
be
young
and
handsome
,
I
should
have
be
tempt
to
think
that
tender
feeling
than
prudence
or
fear
influence
Mr.
Rochester
in
her
behalf
;
but
,
hard
-
favoured
and
matronly
as
she
be
,
the
idea
could
not
be
admit
.
"
<EOS>
yet
,
"
I
reflect
,
"
she
have
be
young
once
;
her
youth
would
be
contemporary
with
her
master
's
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
tell
me
once
,
she
have
live
here
many
year
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
can
ever
have
be
pretty
;
but
,
for
aught
I
know
,
she
may
possess
originality
and
strength
of
character
to
compensate
for
the
want
of
personal
advantage
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
be
an
amateur
of
the
decide
and
eccentric
:
grace
be
eccentric
at
least
.
<EOS>
what
if
a
former
caprice
(
a
freak
very
possible
to
a
nature
so
sudden
and
headstrong
as
his
)
have
deliver
him
into
her
power
,
and
she
now
exercise
over
his
action
a
secret
influence
,
the
result
of
his
own
indiscretion
,
which
he
can
not
shake
off
,
and
dare
not
disregard
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
have
reach
this
point
of
conjecture
,
Mrs.
Poole
's
square
,
flat
figure
,
and
uncomely
,
dry
,
even
coarse
face
,
recur
so
distinctly
to
my
mind
's
eye
,
that
I
think
,
"
no
;
impossible
!
<EOS>
my
supposition
can
not
be
correct
.
<EOS>
yet
,
"
suggest
the
secret
voice
which
talk
to
us
in
our
own
heart
,
"
you
be
not
beautiful
either
,
and
perhaps
Mr.
Rochester
approve
you
:
at
any
rate
,
you
have
often
feel
as
if
he
do
;
and
last
night
 
remember
his
word
;
remember
his
look
;
remember
his
voice
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
well
remember
all
;
language
,
glance
,
and
tone
seem
at
the
moment
vividly
renew
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
the
schoolroom
;
Adele
be
draw
;
I
bend
over
her
and
direct
her
pencil
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
with
a
sort
of
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
Qu

she

She
go
on
sketching
;
I
go
on
thinking

<EOS>
I
hasten
to
drive
from
my
mind
the
hateful
notion
I
have

conceive
respect
Grace

it
disgust
me

<EOS>
I
compare
myself
with
her

find
we

different

Bessie

say
I
be
quite
a
lady
;

she
speak
truth
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
lady

<EOS>
and
now
I
look
much
well
than
I
do
when
Bessie
see
me
;
I
have
more
colour
and
more
flesh

more
life

more
vivacity

I
have
bright
hope

keen
enjoyment

<EOS>
"
evening

say
I
,
as
I
look
towards
the
window

<EOS>
"
I
have
never

Mr.

in
the
house

day
;
but
surely
I
shall
see
him
before
night
:
I
fear
the
meeting
in
the
morning
;
now
I
desire
it
,
because
expectation
have
be
so
long
baffle
that
it
be
grow
impatient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
dusk
actually
close
,
and
when
Adele
leave
me
to
go
and
play
in
the
nursery
with
Sophie
,
I
do
most
keenly
desire
it
.
<EOS>
I
listen
for
the
bell
to
ring
below
;
I
listen
for
Leah
come
up
with
a
message
;
I
fancy
<EOS>
sometimes
I
hear
Mr.
Rochester
's
own
tread
,
and
I
turn
to
the
door
,
expect
it
to
open
and
admit
him
.
<EOS>
the
door
remain
shut
;
darkness
only
come
in
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
still
it
be
not
late
;
he
often
send
for
me
at
seven
and
eight
o'clock
,
and
it
be
yet
but
six
.
<EOS>
surely
I
should
not
be
wholly
disappointed
to
-
night
,
when
I
have
so
many
thing
to
say
to
him
!
<EOS>
I
want
again
to
introduce
the
subject
of
Grace
Poole
,
and
to
hear
what
he
would
answer
;
I
want
to
ask
him
plainly
if
he
really
believe
it
be
she
who
have
make
last
night
's
hideous
attempt
;
and
if
so
,
why
he
keep
her
wickedness
a
secret
.
<EOS>
It
little
matter
whether
my
curiosity
irritate
him
;
I
know
the
pleasure
of
vex
and
soothe
him
by
turn
;
it
be
one
I
chiefly
delight
in
,
and
<EOS>
a
sure
instinct
always
prevent
me
from
go
too
far
;
beyond
the
verge
of
provocation
I
never
venture
;
on
the
extreme
brink
I
like
well
to
try
my
skill
.
<EOS>
retain
every
minute
form
of
respect
,
every
propriety
of
my
station
,
I
could
still
meet
him
in
argument
without
fear
or
uneasy
restraint
;
this
suit
both
him
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
a
tread
creak
on
the
stair
at
last
.
<EOS>
Leah
make
her
appearance
;
but
it
be
only
to
intimate
that
tea
be
ready
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.
<EOS>
Thither
I
repair
,
glad
at
least
to
go
downstairs
;
for
that
bring
me
,
I
imagine
,
near
to
Mr.
Rochester
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
want
your
tea
,
"
say
the
good
lady
,
as
I
join
her
;
"
you
eat
so
little
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
<EOS>
,
"
she
continue
,
"
you
be
not
well
<EOS>
to-
day
:
you
look
flushed
and
feverish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
quite
well
!
<EOS>
I
never
feel
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
must
prove
it
by
evince
a
good
appetite
;
will
you
fill
the
teapot
while
I
knit
off
this
needle
?
"
<EOS>
have
complete
her
task
,
she
rise
to
draw
down
the
blind
,
which
she
have
hitherto
keep
up
,
by
way
,
I
suppose
,
of
make
the
most
of
daylight
,
though
dusk
be
now
fast
deepen
into
total
obscurity
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
fair
to
-
night
,
"
say
she
,
as
she
look
through
the
pane
,
"
though
not
starlight
;
Mr.
Rochester
have
,
on
the
whole
,
have
a
favourable
day
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Journey
!
 
<EOS>
be
Mr.
Rochester
go
anywhere
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
he
be
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
set
off
the
moment
he
have
breakfast
!
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
the
Leas
,
Mr.
Eshton
's
place
,
ten
mile
on
the
other
side
Millcote
.
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
quite
a
party
assemble
there
;
Lord
Ingram
,
Sir
George
Lynn
,
Colonel
Dent
,
and
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
expect
him
back
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
 
nor
to
-
morrow
either
<EOS>
;
I
should
think
he
be
very
likely
to
stay
a
week
or
more
:
<EOS>
when
these
fine
,
fashionable
people
get
together
,
they
be
so
surround
by
elegance
and
gaiety
,
so
well
provide
with
all
that
can
please
and
entertain
,
they
be
in
no
hurry
to
separate
.
<EOS>
gentleman
especially
be
often
in
request
on
such
occasion
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
be
so
talented
and
so
lively
in
society
,
that
I
believe
he
be
a
general
favourite
:
the
lady
be
very
fond
of
him
;
though
you
would
not
think
his
appearance
calculate
to
recommend
him
particularly
in
their
eye
:
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
his
acquirement
and
ability
,
perhaps
his
wealth
and
good
blood
,
make
amend
for
any
little
fault
of
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
lady
at
the
Leas
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
Mrs.
Eshton
and
her
three
daughter
 
very
elegant
young
lady
indeed
;
and
there
be
the
honourable
Blanche
and
Mary
Ingram
,
most
beautiful
woman
,
I
suppose
:
indeed
I
have
see
Blanche
,
six
or
seven
year
since
,
when
she
be
a
girl
of
eighteen
.
<EOS>
She
come
here
to
a
Christmas
ball
and
party
Mr.
Rochester
give
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
see
the
dining
-
room
that
day
 
<EOS>
how
richly
it
be
decorate
,
how
brilliantly
light
up
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
there
be
fifty
lady
and
gentleman
present
 
all
of
the
first
county
family
;
and
Miss
Ingram
be
consider
the
belle
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
her
,
you
say
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
<EOS>
:
what
be
she
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
see
her
.
<EOS>
the
dining
-
room
door
be
throw
open
;
and
,
as
it
be
Christmas
-
time
,
the
servant
be
allow
to
assemble
in
the
hall
,
to
hear
some
of
the
lady
sing
and
play
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
would
have
me
to
come
in
,
and
I
sit
down
in
a
quiet
corner
and
watch
them
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
more
splendid
scene
:
the
lady
be
magnificently
dress
;
most
of
them
 
at
least
most
of
the
young
one
 
look
handsome
;
but
Miss
Ingram
be
certainly
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
she
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
tall
,
fine
bust
,
slope
shoulder
;
long
,
graceful
neck
:
olive
complexion
,
dark
and
clear
;
noble
feature
;
eye
rather
like
Mr.
Rochester
's
:
large
and
black
,
<EOS>
and
as
brilliant
as
her
jewel
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
have
such
a
fine
head
of
hair
;
raven
-
black
and
so
becomingly
arrange
:
a
crown
of
thick
plait
behind
,
and
in
front
the
long
,
the
glossy
curl
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
She
be
dress
in
pure
white
;
an
amber
-
colour
scarf
be
pass
over
her
shoulder
and
across
her
breast
,
tie
at
the
side
,
and
descend
in
long
,
fringed
end
below
her
knee
.
<EOS>
She
wear
an
amber
-
colour
flower
,
too
,
in
her
hair
:
it
contrast
well
with
the
jetty
mass
of
her
curl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
greatly
admire
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
:
and
not
only
for
her
beauty
,
but
for
her
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
the
lady
who
sing
:
a
gentleman
accompany
her
on
the
piano
.
<EOS>
She
and
Mr.
Rochester
sing
a
duet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
he
could
sing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
<EOS>
he
have
a
fine
bass
voice
,
and
an
excellent
taste
for
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
Miss
Ingram
:
<EOS>
what
sort
of
a
voice
have
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
rich
and
powerful
one
<EOS>
:
she
sing
delightfully
;
it
be
a
treat
to
listen
to
her
;
 
and
she
play
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
judge
of
music
,
but
Mr.
Rochester
be
;
and
I
hear
him
say
her
execution
be
remarkably
good
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
this
beautiful
and
accomplished
lady
,
she
be
not
yet
marry
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appear
not
:
I
fancy
<EOS>
neither
she
nor
her
sister
have
very
large
fortune
.
<EOS>
Old
Lord
Ingram
's
estate
be
chiefly
entail
,
and
the
eld
son
come
in
for
everything
almost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
wonder
no
wealthy
nobleman
or
gentleman
have
take
a
fancy
to
her
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
for
instance
.
<EOS>
He
be
rich
,
be
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
you
see
there
be
a
considerable
difference
in
age
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
be
nearly
forty
;
she
be
but
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
more
unequal
match
be
make
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
:
yet
<EOS>
I
should
scarcely
fancy
Mr.
Rochester
would
entertain
an
idea
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
but
you
eat
nothing
:
you
have
scarcely
taste
since
you
begin
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
:
I
be
too
thirsty
to
eat
.
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
have
another
cup
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
about
again
to
revert
to
the
probability
of
a
union
between
Mr.
Rochester
and
the
beautiful
Blanche
;
but
Adele
come
in
,
and
the
conversation
be
turn
into
another
channel
.
  
<EOS>
when
once
more
alone
,
I
review
the
information
I
have
get
;
look
into
my
heart
,
examine
its
thought
and
feeling
,
and
endeavour
to
bring
back
with
a
strict
hand
such
as
have
be
stray
through
imagination
's
boundless
and
trackless
waste
,
into
the
safe
fold
of
common
sense

<EOS>

at
my
own
bar
,
memory
have
give
her
evidence
of
the
hope
,
wish
,
sentiment
I
have
be
cherish
since
last
night
 
of
the
general
state
of
mind
in
which
I
have
indulge
for
nearly
a
fortnight
past
;
reason
have
come
forward
and
tell
,
in
her
own
quiet
way
a
plain
,
unvarnished
tale
,
show
how
I
have
reject
the
real
,
and
rabidly
devour
the
ideal
;
 
I
pronounce
judgment
to
this
effect
:
    
that
a
great
fool
than
Jane
Eyre
have
never
breathe
the
breath
of
life
;
that
a
more
fantastic
idiot
have
never
surfeit
herself
on
sweet
lie
,
and
swallow
poison
as
if
it
be
nectar

pleasure
from

equivocal
token

by
a

of

listen

then
,
Jane
Eyre
,
to
your
sentence

morrow
,
place
the
glass
before

and
draw
in

your
own
picture

faithfully
,
without

afterwards
,
take
a
piece
of
smooth
ivory
 
<EOS>

have
one
prepare
in
your
drawing
-
box
:
take
your
palette
,
mix
your
fresh

fine

clear
tint
;
choose
your
most
delicate
camel

hair
pencil

delineate
carefully
the
lovely
face

can
imagine

paint
it
in
your
soft
shade

accord
to
the
description
give
by
Mrs.

of
Blanche
Ingram

remember
the
raven
ringlet

the
oriental
eye
;
 
<EOS>
what

the
grecian
neck

bust
;

you

out
these

them

Mr.

may
probably
win
that
noble

love

strive
for
it

would
waste
a
serious
thought
on
this
indigent
and
insignificant
plebeian
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
do
it
,

I
resolve
:
and
have
frame
this
determination
,
I
grow
calm
,
and
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
an
hour
or
two
suffice
to
sketch
my
own
portrait
in
crayon
;
and
in
less
than
a
fortnight
I
have
complete
an
ivory
miniature
of
an
imaginary
Blanche
Ingram
.
<EOS>
It
look
a
lovely
face
enough
,
and
when
compare
with
the
real
head
in
chalk
,
the
contrast
be
as
great
as
self-
control
could
desire
.
<EOS>
I
derive
benefit
from
the
task
:
it
have
keep
my
head
and
hand
employ
,
and
have
give
force
and
fixedness
to
the
new
impression
I
wish
to
stamp
indelibly
on
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
have
reason
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
course
of
wholesome
discipline
to
which
I
have
thus
force
my
feeling
to
submit
.
<EOS>
thank
to
it
,
I
be
able
to
meet
subsequent
occurrence
with
a
decent
calm
,
which
,
have
they
find
me
unprepared
,
I
should
probably
have
be
unequal
to
maintain
,
even

<EOS>
a
week
pass
,
and
no
news
arrive
of
Mr.
Rochester
:
ten
day
,
and
still
he
do
not
come
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
say
she
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
be
to
go
straight
from
the
Leas
to
London
,
and
thence
to
the
continent
,
and
not
show
his
face
again
at
Thornfield
for
a
year
to
come
;
he
have
not
unfrequently
quit
it
in
a
manner
quite
as
abrupt
and
unexpected
.
<EOS>
when
I
hear
this
,
I
be
begin
to
feel
a
strange
chill
and
fail
at
the
heart
.
<EOS>
I
be
actually
permit
myself
to
experience
a
sickening
sense
of
disappointment
;
but
rally
my
wit
,
and
recollect
my
principle
,
I
at
once
call
my
sensation
to
order
;
and
it
be
wonderful
how
I
get
over
the
temporary
blunder
 
<EOS>
how
I
clear
up
the
mistake
of
suppose
Mr.
Rochester
's
movement
a
matter
in
which
I
have
any
cause
to
take
a
vital
interest
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
humble
myself
by
a
slavish
notion
of
inferiority
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
just
say
    
"
You
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
master
of
Thornfield
,
further
than
to
receive
the
salary
he
give
you
for
teach
his
protegee
,
and
to
be
grateful
for
such
respectful
and
kind
treatment
as
,
if
you
do
your
duty
,
you
have
a
right
to
expect
at
his
hand
.
<EOS>
be
sure
that
be
the
only
tie
he
seriously
acknowledge
between
you
and
him
;
so
do
not
make
him
the
object
of
your
fine
feeling
,
your
rapture
,
agony
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
of
your
order
:
keep
to
your
caste
,
and
be
too
self
-
respect
to
lavish
the
love
of
the
whole
heart
,
soul
,
and
strength
,
where
such
a
gift
be
not
want
and
would
be
despise
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
go
on
with
my
day
's
business
tranquilly
;
but
ever
and
anon
vague
suggestion
keep
wander
across
my
brain
of
reason
why
I
should
quit
Thornfield
;
and
I
keep
involuntarily
frame
advertisement
and
ponder
conjecture
about
new
situation
:
these
thought
I
do
not
think
to
check
;
they
may
germinate
and
bear
fruit
if
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
have
be
absent
upwards
of
a
fortnight
,
when
the
post
bring
Mrs.
Fairfax
a
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
from
the
master
,
"
say
she
,
as
she
look
at
the
direction
.
<EOS>
"
now
I
suppose
we
shall
know
whether
we
be
to
expect
his
return
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
while
she
break
the
seal
and
peruse
the
document
,
I
go
on
take
my
coffee
(
we
be
at
breakfast
)
:
<EOS>
it
be
hot
,
and
I
attribute
to
that
circumstance
a
fiery
glow
which
suddenly
rise
to
my
face
.
<EOS>
why
my
hand
shake
,
and
why
I
involuntarily
spill
half
the
content
of
my
cup
into
my
saucer
,
I
do
not
choose
to
consider
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
sometimes
think
we
be
too
quiet
;
but
we
run
a
chance
of
be
busy
enough
now
:
for
a
little
while
at
least
,
"
say
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
still
hold
the
note
before
her
spectacle
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
I
permit
myself
to
request
an
explanation
,
I
tie
the
string
of
Adele
's
pinafore
,
which
happen
to
be
loose
:
have
help
her
also
to
another
bun
and
refill
her
mug
with
milk
,
I
say
,
nonchalantly
    
"
Mr.
Rochester
be
not
likely
to
return
soon
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
he
be
 
in
three
day
,
he
say
:
that
will
be
next
Thursday
;
and
not
alone
either
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
many
of
the
fine
people
at
the
Leas
be
come
with
him
:
he
send
direction
for
all
the
good
bedroom
to
be
prepare
;
and
the
library
and
drawing
-
room
be
to
be
clean
out
;
I
be
to
get
more
kitchen
hand
from
the
George
Inn
,
at
Millcote
,
and
from
wherever
else
I
can
;
and
the
lady
will
bring
their
maid
and
the
gentleman
their
valet
:
so
we
shall
have
a
full
house
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
swallow
her
breakfast
and
hasten
away
to
commence
operation
.
  
<EOS>
the
three
day
be
,
as
she
have
foretold
,
busy
enough
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
all
the
room
at
Thornfield
beautifully
clean
and
well
arrange
;
but
it
appear
I
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
three
woman
be
get
to
help
;
and
such
scrubbing
,
such
brushing
,
such
washing
of
paint
and
beating
of
carpet
,
such
take
down
and
put
up
of
picture
,
such
polishing
of
mirror
and
lustre
,
such
lighting
of
fire
in
bedroom
,
such
airing
of
sheet
and
feather
-
bed
on
hearth
,
I
never
beheld
,
either
before
or
since
.
<EOS>
Adele
run
quite
wild
in
the
midst
of
it
:
the
preparation
for
company
and
the
prospect
of
their
arrival
,
seem
to
throw
her
into
ecstasy
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
Sophie
to
look
over
all
her
"
toilette
,
"
as
she
call
frock
;
to
furbish
up
any
that
be
"
_
passee
_
,
"
and
to
air
and
arrange
the
new
.
<EOS>
for
herself
,
she
do
nothing
but
caper
about
in
the
front
chamber
,
jump
on
and
off
the
bedstead
,
and
lie
on
the
mattress
and
pile
-
up
bolster
and
pillow
before
the
enormous
fire
roar
in
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
from
school
duty
she
be
exonerate
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
press
me
into
her
service
,
and
I
be
all
day
in
the
storeroom
,
help
(
or
hinder
)
<EOS>
her
and
the
cook
<EOS>
;
learn
to
make
custard
and
cheese
-
cake
and
french
pastry
,
to
truss
game
and
garnish
desert
-
dish
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
be
expect
to
arrive
on
Thursday
afternoon
,
in
time
for
dinner
at
six
.
<EOS>
during
the
intervene
period
I
have
no
time
to
nurse
chimeras
;
and
I
believe
I
be
as
active
and
gay
as
anybody
 
Adele
except
.
<EOS>
still
,
now
and
then
,
I
receive
a
damping
check
to
my
cheerfulness
;
and
be
,
in
spite
of
myself
,
throw
back
on
the
region
of
doubt
and
portent
,
and
dark
conjecture
.
<EOS>
this
be
when
I
chance
to
see
the
third
-
storey
staircase
door
(
which
of
late
have
always
be
keep
lock
)
open
slowly
,
and
give
passage
to
the
form
of
Grace
Poole
,
in
prim
cap
,
white
apron
,
and
handkerchief
;
when
I
watch
her
glide
along
the
gallery
,
her
quiet
tread
muffle
in
a
list
slipper
;
when
I
see
her
look
into
the
bustling
,
topsy
-
turvy
bedroom
,
 
just
say
a
word
,
perhaps
,
to
the
charwoman
about
the
proper
way
to
polish
a
grate
,
or
clean
a
marble
mantelpiece
,
or
take
stain
from
papered
wall
,
and
then
pass
on
.
<EOS>
She
would
thus
descend
to
the
kitchen
once
a
day
,
eat
her
dinner
,
smoke
a
moderate
pipe
on
the
hearth
,
and
go
back
,
carry
her
pot
of
porter
with
her
,
for
her
private
solace
,
in
her
own
gloomy
,
upper
haunt
.
<EOS>
only
one
hour
in
the
twenty
-
four
do
she
pass
with
her
fellow
-
servant
below
;
all
the
rest
of
her
time
be
spend
in
some
low
-
ceile
,
oaken
chamber
of
the
second
storey
:
there
she
sit
and
sew
 
and
probably
laugh
drearily
to
herself
,
 
as
companionless
as
a
prisoner
in
his
dungeon
.
  
<EOS>
the
strange
thing
of
all
be
,
that
not
a
soul
in
the
house
,
except
me
,
notice
her
habit
,
or
seem
to
marvel
at
them
:
no
one
discuss
her
position
or
employment
;
no
one
pity
her
solitude
or
isolation
.
<EOS>
I
once
,
indeed
,
overheard
part
of
a
dialogue
between
Leah
and
one
of
the
charwoman
,
of
which
Grace
form
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Leah
have
be
say
something
I
have
not
catch
,
and
the
charwoman
remark
    
"
She
get
good
wage
,
I
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Leah
;
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
have
as
good
;
not
that
mine
be
to
complain
of
,
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
stinginess
at
Thornfield
;
but
they
be
not
one
fifth
of
the
sum
Mrs.
Poole
receive
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
lay
by
<EOS>
:
she
go
every
quarter
to
the
bank
at
Millcote
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
but
she
have
save
enough
to
keep
her
independent
if
she
like
to
leave
;
but
I
suppose
she
be
get
use
to
the
place
;
and
then
she
be
not
forty
yet
,
and
strong
and
able
for
anything
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
soon
for
her
to
give
up
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
good
hand
,
I
daresay
,
"
say
the
charwoman
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
 
<EOS>
she
understand
what
she
have
to
do
,
 
<EOS>
nobody
better
,
"
rejoin
Leah
significantly
;
"
and
it
be
not
every
one
could
fill
her
shoe
 
not
for
all
the
money
she
get
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
it
be
not
!
"
be
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
the
master
 
"
  
the
charwoman
be
go
on
;
but
here
Leah
turn
and
perceive
me
,
and
she
instantly
give
her
companion
a
nudge
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
she
know
?
<EOS>
"
I
hear
the
woman
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
Leah
shake
her
head
,
and
the
conversation
be
of
course
drop
.
<EOS>
all
I
have
gather
from
it
amount
to
this
,
 
that
there
be
a
mystery
at
Thornfield
;
and
that
from
participation
in
that
mystery
I
be
purposely
exclude
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
come
:
all
work
have
be
complete
the
previous
evening
;
carpet
be

-
hanging
festooned

radiant
white
counterpane
spread
,
toilet
table
arrange
,
furniture

both
chamber
and
saloon
look
as
fresh
and
bright
as
hand
could
make
them
.
<EOS>
the
hall
,
too
,
be
scour
;
and
the
great
carved
clock
,
as
well
as
the
step
and
banister
of
the
staircase

be
polish
to
the
brightness
of
glass

in
the

<EOS>
afternoon
arrive
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
assume
her
good
black
satin
gown
,
her
glove
,
and
her
gold
watch
;
for
it
be
her
part
to
receive
the
company
,
 
to
conduct
the
lady
to
their
room
,
&
c.
Adele
<EOS>
,
too
,
would
be
dress
:
though
I
think
she
have
little
chance
of
be
introduce
to
the
party
that
day
at
least
.
<EOS>
however
,
to
please
her
,
I
allow
Sophie
to
apparel
her
in
one
of
her
short
,
full
muslin
frock
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
have
no
need
to
make
any
change
;
I
should
not
be
call
upon
to
quit
my
sanctum
of
the
schoolroom
;
for
a
sanctum
it
be
now
become
to
me
,
 
"
a
very
pleasant
refuge
in
time
of
trouble
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
mild
,
serene
spring
day
 
one
of
those
day
which
,
towards
the
end
of
March
or
the
beginning
of
April
,
rise
shine
over
the
earth
as
herald
of
summer
.
<EOS>
It
be
draw
to
an
end
now
;
but
the
evening
be
even
warm
,
and
I
sit
at
work
in
the

<EOS>
"

say
Mrs.
Fairfax

enter
in
rustle
state

I
be
glad
I
order
dinner
an
hour
after
the
time
Mr.
Rochester

;
for
it
be
past
six
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
send
John
down
to
the
gate
to
see
if
there
be
anything

one
can

They

<EOS>
Adele
fly
to
the
window

<EOS>
I
follow
,
take
care
to
stand
on
one
side
,
so
that

screen
by
the
curtain
,
I
could
see

<EOS>
the
ten
minute
John
have
give
seem
very
long
,
but
at
last
wheel
be
hear
;
four
equestrians
gallop
up
the
drive
,
and
after
them
come
two
open

<EOS>
"

exclaim
Mrs.

<EOS>
the
cavalcade
,
follow
the
sweep
of
the
drive
,
quickly
turn
the
angle
of
the
house
,
and
I
lose
sight
of

<EOS>
Adele
now
petition
to
go
down
;
but
I
take
her
on
my
knee
,
and
give
her
to
understand
that
she
must
not
on
any
account
think
of
venture
in
sight
of
the
lady
,
either
now
or
at
any
other
time
,
unless
expressly
send
for

that
Mr.

&
c.
"
<EOS>
some
natural
tear

on

tell
this

<EOS>
but
as
I
begin
to
look
very
grave
,
she
consent
at
last
to
wipe
them
.
  
<EOS>
a
joyous
stir
be
now
audible
in
the
hall
:
gentlemen
's
deep
tone
and
lady
'
silvery
accent
blent
harmoniously
together
,
and
distinguishable
above
all
,
though
not
loud
,
be
the
sonorous
voice
of
the
master
of
Thornfield
Hall
,
welcome
his
fair
and
gallant
guest
under
its
roof
.
<EOS>
then
light
step
ascend
the
stair
;
and
there
be
a
tripping
through
the
gallery
,
and
soft
cheerful
laugh
,
and
opening
and
closing
door

and
,
for
a
time

a
hush

<EOS>
"

"

"
quand
il
y
avait
<EOS>
du
monde
,
je
le
suivais
partout
,
au
salon
et
a
leurs
chambre

souvent
je
regardais
les
femmes
de
chambre
coiffer
et
habiller
les
dames
,
et
c'etait
<EOS>
si
<EOS>
amusant
:
<EOS>

apprend

<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
you
feel
hungry
,
Adele
?
"
  
"
Mais
oui
,
mademoiselle
:
voila
cinq
ou
six
heure
que
nous
n'avons
pas
mange
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
now
,
while
the
lady
be
in
their
room
,
I
will
venture
down
and
get
you
something
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
issue
from
my
asylum
with
precaution
,
I
seek
a
back
-
stair
which
conduct
directly
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
all
in
that
region
be
fire
and
commotion
;
the
soup
and
fish
be
in
the
last
stage
of
projection
,
and
the
cook
hang
over
her
crucible
in
a
frame
of
mind
and
body
threaten
spontaneous
combustion
.
<EOS>
in
the
servant
'
hall
two
coachman
and
three
gentleman
's
gentleman
stand
or
sit
round
the
fire
;
the
abigail
,
I
suppose
,
be
upstairs
with
their
mistress
;
the
new
servant
,
that
have
be
hire
from
Millcote
,
be
bustle
about
everywhere
.
<EOS>
thread
this
chaos
,
I
at
last
reach
the
larder
;
there
I
take
possession
of
a
cold
chicken
,
a
roll
of
bread
,
some
tart
,
a
plate
or
two
and
a
knife
and
fork
:
with
this
booty
<EOS>
I
make
a
hasty
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
have
regain
the
gallery
,
and
be
just
shut
the
back
-
door
behind
me
,
when
an
accelerated
hum
warn
me
that
the
lady
be
about
to
issue
from
their
chamber
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
proceed
to
the
schoolroom
without
pass
some
of
their
door
,
and
run
the
risk
of
be
surprised
with
my
cargo
of
victualage
;
so
I
stand
still
at
this
end
,
which
,
be
windowless
,
be
dark
:
quite
dark
now
,
for
the
sun
be
set
and
twilight
gathering
.
  
<EOS>
presently
the
chamber
give
up
their
fair
tenant
one
after
another
:
each
come
out
gaily
and
airily
,
with
dress
that
gleam
lustrous
through
the
dusk
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
they
stand
group
together
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
gallery
,
converse
in
a
key
of
sweet
subdued
vivacity
:
they
then
descend
the
staircase
almost
as
noiselessly
as
a
bright
mist
roll
down
a
hill
.
<EOS>
Their
collective
appearance
have
leave
on
me
an
impression
of
high-
bear
elegance
,
such
as
I
have
never
before
receive
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
Adele
peep
through
the
schoolroom
door
,
which
she
hold
ajar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
beautiful
lady
!
"
cry
she
in
English
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
I
wish
I
may
go
to
them
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
Mr.
Rochester
will
send
for
us
by
-
and
-
bye
,
after
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
I
do
not
;
Mr.
Rochester
have
something
else
to
think
about
.
<EOS>
never
mind
the
lady
to
-
night
;
perhaps
you
will
see
them
to
-
morrow
:
here
be
your
dinner
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
really
hungry
,
so
the
chicken
and
tart
serve
to
divert
her
attention
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
<EOS>
I
secure
this
forage
,
or
both
she
,
I
,
and
Sophie
,
to
whom
I
convey
a
share
of
our
repast
,
would
have
run
a
chance
of
get
no
dinner
at
all
:
every
one
downstairs
be
too
much
engage
to
think
of
us
.
<EOS>
the
dessert
be
not
carry
out
till
after
nine
and
at
ten
footman
be
still
run
to
and
fro
with
trays
and
coffee-
cup
.
<EOS>
I
allow
Adele
to
sit
up
much
later
than
usual
;
for
she
declare
she
could
not
possibly
go
to
sleep
while
the
door
keep
open
and
shut
below
,
and
people
bustle
about
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
add
,
a
message
may
possibly
come
from
Mr.
Rochester
when
she
be
undress
;
"
et
alor
quel
dommage
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
story
as
long
as
she
would
listen
to
them
;
and
then
for
a
change
I
take
her
out
into
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
the
hall
lamp
be
now
light
,
and
it
amuse
her
to
look
over
the
balustrade
and
watch
the
servant
pass
backwards
and
forwards
.
<EOS>
when
the
evening
be
far
advanced
,
a
sound
of
music
issue
from
the
drawing
-
room
,
whither
the
piano
have
be
remove
;
Adele
and
I
sit
down
on
the
top
step
of
the
stair
to
listen
.
<EOS>
presently
a
voice
blent
with
the
rich
tone
of
the
instrument
;
it
be
a
lady
who
sing
,
and
very
sweet
her
note
be
.
<EOS>
the
solo
over
,
a
duet
follow
,
and
then
a
glee
:
a
joyous
conversational
murmur
fill
up
the
interval
.
<EOS>
I
listen
long
:
suddenly
I
discover
that
my
ear
be
wholly
intent
on
analyse
the
mingle
sound
,
and
try
to
discriminate
amidst
the
confusion
of
accent
those
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
and
when
it
catch
them
,
which
it
soon
do
,
it
find
a
further
task
in
frame
the
tone
,
render
by
distance
inarticulate
,
into
word
.
  
<EOS>
the
clock
strike
eleven
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
Adele
,
whose
head
leant
against
my
shoulder
;
her
eye
be
wax
heavy
,
so
I
take
her
up
in
my
arm
and
carry
her
off
to
bed
.
<EOS>
It
be
near
one
before
the
gentleman
and
lady
seek
their
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
as
fine
as
its
predecessor
:
it
be
devote
by
the
party
to
an
excursion
to
some
site
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
They
set
out
early
in
the
forenoon
,
some
on
horseback
,
the
rest
in
carriage
;
I
witness
both
the
departure
and
the
return
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
,
as
before
,
be
the
only
lady
equestrian
;
and
,
as
before
,
Mr.
Rochester
gallop
at
her
side
;
the
two
ride
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
.
<EOS>
I
point
out
this
circumstance
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
be
stand
at
the
window
with
me
    
<EOS>
"
You
say
it
be
not
likely
they
should
think
of
be
marry
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
see
Mr.
Rochester
evidently
prefer
her
to
any
of
the
other
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
daresay
:
no
doubt
he
admire
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
him
,
"
I
add
;
"
look
how
she
lean
her
head
towards
him
as
if
she
be
converse
confidentially
;
I
wish
I
could
see
her
face
;
I
have
never
have
a
glimpse
of
it
yet
.
"
  
"
You
will
see
her
this
evening
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
remark
to
Mr.
Rochester
how
much
Adele
wish
to
be
introduce
to
the
lady
,
and
he
say
:
"
oh
!
let
her
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
;
and
request
Miss
Eyre
to
accompany
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
he
say
that
from
mere
politeness
:
I
need
not
go
,
I
be
sure
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
observe
to
him
that
as
you
be
unused
to
company
,
I
do
not
think
you
would
like
appear
before
so
gay
a
party
 
<EOS>
all
stranger
;
and
he
reply
,
in
his
quick
way
 
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
if
she
object
,
tell
her
it
be
my
particular
wish
;
and
if
she
resist
,
say
I
shall
come
and
fetch
her
in
case
of
contumacy
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
not
give
him
that
trouble
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
,
if
no
well
may
be
;
but
I
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
there
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
plead
off
,
and
he
admit
my
plea
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
how
to
manage
so
as
to
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
make
a
formal
entrance
,
which
be
the
most
disagreeable
part
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
into
the
drawing-
room
while
it
be
empty
,
before
the
lady
leave
the
dinner
-
table
;
choose
your
seat
in
any
quiet
nook
you
like
;
you
need
not
stay
long
after
the
gentleman
come
in
,
unless
you
please
:
just
let
Mr.
Rochester
see
you
be
there
and
then
slip
away
 
nobody
will
notice
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
these
people
remain
long
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
perhaps
two
or
three
week
,
certainly
not
more
.
<EOS>
after
the
Easter
recess
,
Sir
George
Lynn
,
who
be
lately
elect
member
for
Millcote
,
will
have
to
go
up
to
town
and
take
his
seat
;
I
daresay
Mr.
Rochester
will
accompany
him
:
it
surprise
me
that
he
have
already
make
so
protract
a
stay
at
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
some
trepidation
that
I
perceive
the
hour
approach
when
I
be
to
repair
with
my
charge
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Adele
have
be
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
all
day
,
after
hear
she
be
to
be
present
to
the
lady
in
the
evening
;
and
it
be
not
till
Sophie
commence
the
operation
of
dress
her
that
she
sober
down
.
<EOS>
then
the
importance
of
the
process
quickly
steady
her
,
and
by
the
time
she
have
her
curl
arrange
in
well
-
smooth
,
droop
cluster
,
her
pink
satin
frock
put
on
,
her
long
sash
tie
,
and
her
lace
mitten
adjust
,
she
look
as
grave
as
any
judge
.
<EOS>
no
need
to
warn
her
not
to
disarrange
her
attire
<EOS>
:
when
she
be
dress
,
she
sit
demurely
down
in
her
little
chair
,
take
care
previously
to
lift
up
the
satin
skirt
for
fear
she
should
crease
it
,
and
assure
me
she
would
not
stir
thence
till
I
be
ready
.
<EOS>
this
I
quickly
be
:
my
good
dress
(
the
silver
-
grey
one
,
purchase
for
Miss
Temple
's
wedding
,
and
never
wear
since
)
be
soon
put
on
;
my
hair
be
soon
smooth
;
my
sole
ornament
,
the
pearl
brooch
,
soon
assume
.
<EOS>
We
descend
.
  
<EOS>
fortunately
there
be
another
entrance
to
the
drawing
-
room
than
that
through
the
saloon
where
they
be
all
seat
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
We
find
the
apartment
vacant
;
a
large
fire
burn
silently
on
the
marble
hearth
,
and
wax
candle
shine
in
bright
solitude
,
amid
the
exquisite
flower
with
which
the
table
be
adorn
.
<EOS>
the
crimson
curtain
hang
before
the
arch
:
slight
as
be
the
separation
<EOS>
this
drapery
form
from
the
party
in
the
adjoining
saloon
,
they
speak
in
so
low
a
key
that
nothing
of
their
conversation
could
be
distinguish
beyond
a
soothing
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
Adele
,
who
appear
to
be
still
under
the
influence
of
a
most
solemnising
impression
,
sit
down
,
without
a
word
,
on
the
footstool
<EOS>
I
point
out
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
retire
to
a
window
-
seat
,
and
take
a
book
from
a
table
near
,
endeavour
to
read
.
<EOS>
Adele
bring
her
stool
to
my
foot
;
ere
long
she
touch
my
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
,
Adele
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Est
-
ce
que
je
<EOS>
ne
puis
pas
prendrie
une
seule
de
ces
fleur
magnifique
,
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
seulement
pour
completer
ma
toilette
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
too
much
of
your
"
toilette
,
"
Adele
:
but
you
may
have
a
flower
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
take
a
rose
from
a
vase
and
fasten
it
in
her
sash
.
<EOS>
She
sigh
a
sigh
of
ineffable
satisfaction
,
as
if
her
cup
of
happiness
be
now
full
.
<EOS>
I
turn
my
face
away
to
conceal
a
smile
I
could
not
suppress
:
there
be
something
ludicrous
as
well
as
painful
in
the
little
Parisienne
's
earnest
and
innate
devotion
to
matter
of
dress
.
  
<EOS>
a
soft
sound
of
rise
now
become
audible
;
the
curtain
be
sweep
back
from
the
arch
;
through
it
appear
the
dining
-
room
,
with
its
light
lustre
pour
down
light
on
the
silver
and
glass
of
a
magnificent
dessert
-
service
cover
a
long
table
;
a
band
of
lady
stand
in
the
opening
;
they
enter
,
and
the
curtain
fall
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
eight
;
yet
,
somehow
,
as
they
flock
in
,
they
give
the
impression
of
a
much
large
number
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
be
very
tall
;
many
be
dress
in
white
;
and
all
have
a
sweeping
amplitude
of
array
that
seem
to
magnify
their
person
as
a
mist
magnify
the
moon
.
<EOS>
I
rise
and
curtsey
to
them
:
one
or
two
bent
their
head
in
return
,
the
other
only
stare
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
They
disperse
about
the
room
,
remind
me
,
by
the
lightness
and
buoyancy
of
their
movement
,
of
a
flock
of
white
plumy
bird
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
throw
themselves
in
half
-
recline
position
on
the
sofa
and
ottomans
:
some
bent
over
the
table
and
examine
the
flower
and
book
:
the
rest
gather
in
a
group
round
the
fire
:
all
talk
in
a
low
but
clear
tone
which
seem
habitual
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
name
afterwards
,
and
may
as
well
mention
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
there
be
Mrs.
Eshton
and
two
of
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
have
evidently
be
a
handsome
woman
,
and
be
well
preserve
still
.
<EOS>
of
her
daughter
,
the
eld
,
Amy
,
be
rather
little
:
naive
,
and
child
-
like
in
face
and
manner
,
and
piquant
in
form
;
her
white
muslin
dress
and
blue
sash
become
her
well
.
<EOS>
the
second
,
Louisa
,
be
tall
and
more
elegant
in
figure
;
with
a
very
pretty
face
,
of
that
order
the
french
term
_
minois
chiffone
_
:
both
sister
be
fair
as
lily
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Lynn
be
a
large
and
stout
personage
of
about
forty
,
very
erect
,
very
haughty
-
looking
,
richly
dress
in
a
satin
robe
of
changeful
sheen
:
her
dark
hair
shine
glossily
under
the
shade
of
an
azure
plume
,
and
within
the
circlet
of
a
band
of
gem
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Colonel
Dent
be
less
showy
;
but
,
I
think
,
more
lady
-
like
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
slight
figure
,
a
pale
,
gentle
face
,
and
fair
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
black
satin
dress
,
her
scarf
of
rich
foreign
lace
,
and
her
pearl
ornament
,
please
me
better
than
the
rainbow
radiance
of
the

<EOS>
but
the
three
most
distinguished
 
partly
,
perhaps
,
because
the
tall
figure
of
the
band
 
be
the
Dowager
Lady
Ingram
and
her
daughter
,
Blanche
and
Mary
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
three
of
the
lofty
stature
of
woman
.
<EOS>
the
Dowager
may
be
between
forty
and
fifty
:
her
shape
be
still
fine
;
her
hair
(
by
candle
-
light
at
least
)
still
black
;
her
tooth
,
too
,
be
still
apparently
perfect
.
<EOS>
Most
people
would
have
term
her
a
splendid
woman
of
her
age
:
and
so
she
be
,
no
doubt
,
physically
speak
;
but
then
there
be
an
expression
of
almost
insupportable
haughtiness
in
her
bearing
and
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
have
roman
feature
and
a
double
chin
,
disappear
into
a
throat
like
a
pillar
:
these
feature
appear
to
me
not
only
inflate
and
darken
,
but
even
furrow
with
pride
;
and
the
chin
be
sustain
by
the
same
principle
,
in
a
position
of
almost
preternatural
erectness
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
likewise
,
a
fierce
and
a
hard
eye
:
it
remind
me
of
Mrs.
Reed
's
;
she
mouth
her
word
in
speak
;
her
voice
be
deep
,
its
inflection
very
pompous
,
very
dogmatical
,
 
very
intolerable
,
in
short
.
<EOS>
a
crimson
velvet
robe
,
and
a
shawl
turban
of
some
gold
-
work
indian
fabric
,
invest
her
<EOS>
(
I
suppose
she
think
)
with
a
truly
imperial
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
Blanche
and
Mary
be
of
equal
stature
,
 
straight
and
tall
as
poplar
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
too
slim
for
her
height
,
but
Blanche
be
mould
like
a
Dian
.
<EOS>
I
regard
her
,
of
course
,
with
special
interest
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
wish
to
see
whether
her
appearance
accord
with
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
description
;
secondly
,
whether
it
at
all
resemble
the
fancy
miniature
I
have
paint
of
her
;
and
thirdly
 
it
will
out
!
 
<EOS>
whether
it
be
such
as
I
should
fancy
likely
to
suit
Mr.
Rochester
's
taste
.
  
<EOS>
as
far
as
person
go
,
she
answer
point
for
point
,
both
to
my
picture
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
description
.
<EOS>
the
noble
bust
,
the
slope
shoulder
,
the
graceful
neck
,
the
dark
eye
and
black
ringlet
be
all
there
;
 
but
her
face
?
<EOS>
Her
face
be
like
her
mother
's
;
a
youthful
unfurrowed
likeness
:
the
same
low
brow
,
the
same
high
feature
,
the
same
pride
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
however
,
so
saturnine
a
pride
!
<EOS>
she
laugh
continually
;
her
laugh
be
satirical
,
and
so
be
the
habitual
expression
of
her
arched
and
haughty
lip
.
  
<EOS>
genius
be
say
to
be
self
-
conscious
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
whether
Miss
Ingram
be
a
genius
,
but
she
be
self
-
conscious
 
remarkably
self
-
conscious
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
enter
into
a
discourse
on
botany
with
the
gentle
Mrs.
Dent
.
<EOS>
It
seem
Mrs.
Dent
have
not
study
that
science
:
though
,
as
she
say
,
she
like
flower
,
"
especially
wild
one
;
"
Miss
Ingram
have
,
and
she
run
over
its
vocabulary
with
an
air
.
<EOS>
I
presently
perceive
she
be
(
what
be
vernacularly
term
)
<EOS>
_
trail
_
Mrs.
Dent
;
that
is
,
play
on
her
ignorance
 
<EOS>
her
_
trail
_
may
be
clever
,
but
it
be
decidedly
not
good-
natured
.
<EOS>
She
play
:
her
execution
be
brilliant
;
she
sing
:
her
voice
be
fine
;
she
talk
French
apart
to
her
mamma
;
and
she
talk
it
well
,
with
fluency
and
with
a
good
accent
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
have
a
milder
and
more
open
countenance
than
Blanche
;
soft
feature
too
,
and
a
skin
some
shade
fairer
<EOS>
(
Miss
Ingram
be
dark
as
a
Spaniard
)
 
<EOS>
but
Mary
be
deficient
in
life
<EOS>
:
her
face
lack
expression
,
her
eye
lustre
;
she
have
nothing
to
say
,
and
have
once
take
her
seat
,
remain
fix
like
a
statue
in
its
niche
.
<EOS>
the
sister
be
both
attire
in
spotless
white
.
  
<EOS>
and
do
I
now
think
Miss
Ingram
<EOS>
such
a
choice
as
Mr.
Rochester
would
be
likely
to
make
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
 
I
do
not
know
his
taste
in
female
beauty
.
<EOS>
if
he
like
the
majestic
,
she
be
the
very
type
of
majesty
:
then
she
be
accomplish
,
sprightly
.
<EOS>
Most
gentleman
would
admire
her
,
I
think
;
and
that
he
_
do
_
admire
her
,
I
already
seem
to
have
obtain
proof
:
to
remove
the
last
shade
of
doubt
,
it
remain
but
to
see
them
together
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
not
to
suppose
,
reader
,
that
Adele
have
all
this
time
be
sit
motionless
on
the
stool
at
my
foot
:
<EOS>
no
;
when
the
lady
enter
,
she
rise
,
advance
to
meet
them
,
make
a
stately
reverence
,
and
say
with
gravity
    
"
Bon
jour
,
mesdames
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
Miss
Ingram
have
look
down
at
her
with
a
mock
air
,
and
exclaim
,
"
oh
,
what
a
little
puppet
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Lynn
have
remark
,
"
It
be
Mr.
Rochester
's
ward
,
I
suppose
 
the
little
french
girl
he
be
speak
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dent
have
kindly
take
her
hand
,
and
give
her
a
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
Amy
and
Louisa
Eshton
have
cry
out
simultaneously
 
"
what
a
love
of
a
child
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
they
have
call
her
to
a
sofa
,
where
she
now
sit
,
ensconce
between
them
,
chatter
alternately
in
French
and
break
English
;
absorb
not
only
the
young
lady
'
attention
,
but
that
of
Mrs.
Eshton
and
Lady
Lynn
,
and
get
spoilt
to
her
heart
's
content
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
coffee
be
bring
in
,
and
the
gentleman
be
summon
.
<EOS>
I
sit
in
the
shade
 
<EOS>
if
any
shade
there
be
in
this
brilliantly
-
light
apartment
;
the
window

curtain
half
hide
me
.
<EOS>
again
the
arch
yawn
;
they
come
.
<EOS>
the
collective
appearance
of
the
gentleman
,
like
that
of
the
lady
,
be
very
imposing
:
they
be
all
costume
in
black
;
most
of
them
be
tall
,
some
young
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
Frederick
Lynn
be
very
dashing
spark
indeed
;
and
Colonel
Dent
be
a
fine
soldierly
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Eshton
,
the
magistrate
of
the
district
,
be
gentleman
-
like
:
his
hair
be
quite
white
,
his
eyebrow
and
whisker
still
dark
,
which
give
him
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
"
pere
noble
de
theatre
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Ingram
,
like
his
sister
,
be
very
tall
;
like
them
,
also
,
he
be
handsome
;
but
he
share
Mary
's
apathetic
and
listless
look
:
he
seem
to
have
more
length
of
limb
than
vivacity
of
blood
or
vigour
of
brain
.
  
<EOS>
and
where
be
Mr.
Rochester
?
  
<EOS>
He
come
in
last
<EOS>
:
I
be
not
look
at
the
arch
,
yet
I
see
him
enter
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
those
netting
-
needle
,
on
the
mesh
of
the
purse
<EOS>
I
be
form
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
think
only
of
the
work
I
have
in
my
hand
,
to
see
only
the
silver
bead
and
silk
thread
that
lie
in
my
lap
;
whereas
,
I
distinctly
behold
his
figure
,
and
I
inevitably
recall
the
moment
when
I
last
see
it
;
just
after
I
have
render
him
,
what
he
deem
,
an
essential
service
,
and
<EOS>
he
,
hold
my
hand
,
and
look
down
on
my
face
,
survey
me
with
eye
that
reveal
a
heart
full
and
eager
to
overflow
;
in
whose
emotion
I
have
a
part
.
<EOS>
how
near
have
I
approach
him
at
that
moment
!
<EOS>
what
have
occur
since
,
calculate
to
change
his
and
my
relative
position
?
<EOS>
yet
now
,
how
distant
,
how
far
estranged
we
be
!
<EOS>
so
far
estranged
,
that
I
do
not
expect
him
to
come
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
,
when
,
without
look
at
me
,
he
take
a
seat
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
begin
converse
with
some
of
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
I
see
that
his
attention
be
rivet
on
them
,
and
that
I
may
gaze
without
be
observe
,
than
my
eye
be
draw
involuntarily
to
his
face
;
I
could
not
keep
their
lid
under
control
:
they
would
rise
,
and
the
irid
would
fix
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
look
,
and
have
an
acute
pleasure
in
look
,
 
a
precious
yet
poignant
pleasure
;
pure
gold
,
with
a
steely
point
of
agony
:
a
pleasure
like
what
the
thirst
-
perish
man
may
feel
who
know
the
well
to
which
he
have
creep
be
poison
,
yet
stoop
and
drink
divine
draught
nevertheless

most
true
be
it
that
"
beauty
be
in
the
eye
of
the
gazer

My
master
's
colourless
,
olive
face
,
square
,
massive
brow

broad
and
jetty

deep
eye
,
strong
feature
,
firm
,
grim
mouth
,
 
all
energy
,
decision
,
will
,
 
be
not
beautiful
,
accord
to
rule
;
but
they
be
more
than
beautiful
to
me
;
they
be
full
of
an
interest
,
an
influence
that
quite
master
me
,
 
that
take
my
feeling
from
my
own
power
and
fetter
them
in
his
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
intend
to
love
him
;
the
reader
know
I
have
work
hard
to
extirpate
from
my
soul
the
germ
of
love
there
detect
;
and
now
,
at
the
first
renew
view
of
him
,
they
spontaneously
arrive
,
green
and
strong
!
<EOS>
He
make
me
love
him
without
look
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
compare
him
with
his
guest
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
gallant
grace
of
the
Lynns
,
the
languid
elegance
of
Lord
Ingram
,
 
even
the
military
distinction
of
Colonel
Dent
,
contrast
with
his
look
of
native
pith
and
genuine
power
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
sympathy
in
their
appearance
,
their
expression
:
yet
I
could
imagine
that
most
observer
would
call
them
attractive
,
handsome
,
impose
;
while
they
would
pronounce
Mr.
Rochester
at
once
harsh
-
featured
and
melancholy
-
looking
.
<EOS>
I
see
them
smile
,
laugh
 
<EOS>
it
be
nothing
;
the
light
of
the
candle
have
as
much
soul
in
it
as
their
smile
;
the
tinkle
of
the
bell
as
much
significance
as
their
laugh
.
<EOS>
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
smile
:
 
his
stern
feature
soften
;
his
eye
grow
both
brilliant
and
gentle
,
its
ray
both
searching
and
sweet
.
<EOS>
He
be
talk
,
at
the
moment
,
to
Louisa
and
Amy
Eshton

<EOS>
I
wonder
to
see
them
receive
with
calm
that
look
which
seem
to
me
so
penetrate
:
<EOS>
I
expect
their
eye
to
fall
,
their
colour
to
rise
under
it
;
yet
I
be
glad
when
I
find
they
be
in
no
sense
move
.

<EOS>
He
be
not

them
what
he
be

I
think
:

<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
of
mine

I
be
sure
he
be
 
<EOS>
I
feel
akin
to
him
 
<EOS>
I
understand
the
language
of
his
countenance
and
movement
:
though
rank
and
wealth
sever
us
widely
,
I
have
something
in
my
brain
and
heart
,
in
my
blood
and
nerve
,
that
assimilate
me
mentally
to
him
.
<EOS>
do
I
say
,
a
few
day
since
,
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
him

to
receive
my
salary
at
his
hand

<EOS>
do
I
forbid
myself
to
think
of
him
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
paymaster
?
<EOS>
blasphemy
against
nature
!
<EOS>
every
good
,
true
,
vigorous
feeling
I
have
gather
impulsively
round
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
must
conceal
my
sentiment
:
I
must
smother
hope
;
I
must
remember
that
he
can
not
care
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
for
when
I
say
that
I
be
of
his
kind
,
I
do
not
mean
that
I
have
his
force
to
influence
,
and
his
spell
to
attract
<EOS>
;
I
mean
only
that
I
have
certain
taste
and
feeling
in
common
with
him

<EOS>
I
must
,
then
,
repeat
continually
that
we

You
should
have
send
her
to
school

"
  
<EOS>

I
could
not
afford
it
:
school
be
so
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
suppose
you
have
a
governess
for
her
:
I
see
a
person
with
her
just
now
 
<EOS>
be
she
go
?
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
there
she
be
still
,
behind
the
window-
curtain
.
<EOS>
You
pay
her
,
of
course
;
I
should
think
it
quite
as
expensive
,
 
more
so
;
for
you
have
them
both
to
keep
in
addition
.

"
  
<EOS>
I
fear
 
or
<EOS>
should
I
say
,
hope
?
 
<EOS>
the
allusion
to
me
would
make
Mr.
Rochester
glance
my
way
;
and
I
involuntarily
shrink
farther
into
the
shade
:
but
he
never
turn
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not

the

say
he
indifferently
,
look
straight
before
him

<EOS>
"
no
,
you
man
never
do
consider
economy
and
common
sense
.
<EOS>
You
should
hear
mama
on
the
chapter
of
governess
:
<EOS>
Mary
and
I
have
have
,
I
should
think
,
a
dozen
at
least
in
our
day
;
half
of
them
detestable
and
the
rest
ridiculous
,
and
all
incubi
 
be
they
not
,
mama
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
speak
,
my
own
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
thus
claim
as
the
dowager
's
special
property
,
reiterate
her
question
with
an
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
,
do
not
mention
governess
;
the
word
make
me
nervous
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
a
martyrdom
from
their
incompetency
and
caprice
.
<EOS>
I
thank
Heaven
I
have
now
do
with
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dent
here
bend
over
to
the
pious
lady
and
whisper
something
in
her
ear
;
I
suppose
,
from
the
answer
elicit
,
it
be
a
reminder
that
one
of
the
anathematised
race
be
present
.
  
<EOS>
"

her
Ladyship

I
hope

may
do
her
good

<EOS>
then
,
in
a
low
tone
,
but
still
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
,
"
I
notice
her
;
I
be
a
judge
of
physiognomy
,
and
in
her
I
see
all
the
fault
of
her
class

<EOS>
"
what
be
they
,

"
inquire
Mr.

aloud

<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
in

private
ear

reply
she
,
wag
her
turban
three
time
with
portentous
significancy
.
  
<EOS>

my
curiosity
will
be
past

it
crave
food
now

ask
Blanche

not

him

me

<EOS>
I
have
just
one
word
to
say
of
the
whole
tribe
;
they
be
a
nuisance
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
ever
suffer
much
from
them
;
I
take
care
to
turn
the
table
.
<EOS>
what
trick
Theodore
<EOS>
and
I
use
to
play
on
our
Miss
Wilsons
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greys
,
and
Madame
Jouberts
!
<EOS>
Mary
be
always
too
sleepy
to
join
in
a
plot
with
spirit

<EOS>
the
good
fun
be
with
Madame
Joubert
:
<EOS>
Miss
Wilson
be
a
poor
sickly
thing
,
lachrymose
and
low-
<EOS>
spirit
,
not
worth
the
trouble
of
vanquish
,
in
short
;
and
Mrs.
Grey
be
coarse
and
insensible
;
no
blow
take
effect
on
her
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Madame
Joubert
!
<EOS>
I
see
her
yet
in
her
rage
passion
,
when
we
have
drive
her
to
extremity
 
spilt
our
tea
,
crumble
our
bread
and
butter
,
toss
our
book
up
to
the
ceiling

play
a
charivari
with

Theodore

do
you
remember

merry
day

<EOS>

Yaas

be

I
do

drawl
Lord

"
and
the
poor
old
stick
use
to
cry
out
"
<EOS>
oh
you
villain
child

"
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
sermonise
her
on
the
presumption
of
attempt
to
teach
such
clever
blade
as
we
be
,
when
she
be
herself
so
ignorant

He
and

take
the
liberty

fall
in
love
with
each
other
 
at

Tedo

I
think
so
;
we
surprise
sundry
tender

we
interpret
as
token
of

It

my
opinion
the

insipid

to
my

nothing
without
a
spice
of
the
devil
in
him
;
and
history
may
say
what
it
will
of
James
Hepburn

but
I
have
a
notion
,
he
be
just
the
sort
of
wild
,
fierce
,
bandit
hero

I
could
have
consent

gift
with

both

Mrs.
Fairfax
have
say
Mr.

possess
a
fine
voice
:
he
do
 
a
mellow
,
powerful
bass
,
into
which
he
throw
his
own
feeling
,
his
own
force
;
find
a
way
through
the
ear
to
the
heart

there
wake
sensation
strangely

indeed

they

there
now

shine

swimming

a

from
the

fall
on

<EOS>
if
I
have
time

and
be
not
in
mortal
dread
of
some

I

I

I

<EOS>
Merry
day
be
these
at
Thornfield
Hall
;
and
busy
day
too
<EOS>
:
how
different
from
the
first
three
month
of
stillness
,
monotony
,
and
solitude
I
have
pass
beneath
its
roof
!
<EOS>
all
sad
feeling
seem
now
drive
from
the
house
,
all
gloomy
association
forget
:
there
be
life
everywhere
,
movement
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
now
traverse
the
gallery
,
once
so
hushed
,
nor
enter
the
front
chamber
,
once
so
tenantless
,
without
encounter
a
smart
lady'
-
maid
or
a
dandy
valet
.
  
<EOS>
the
kitchen
,
the
butler
's
pantry
,
the
servant
'
hall
,
the
entrance
hall
,
be
equally
alive
;
and
the
saloon
be
only
leave
void
and
still
when
the
blue
sky
and
halcyon
sunshine
of
the
genial
spring
weather
call
their
occupant
out
into
the
ground
.
<EOS>
even
when
that
weather
be
break
,
and
continuous
rain
set
in
for
some
day
,
no
damp
seem
cast
over
enjoyment
:
indoor
amusement
only
become
more
lively
and
varied
,
in
consequence
of
the
stop
put
to
outdoor
gaiety
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
be
go
to
do
the
first
evening
a
change
of
entertainment
be
propose
:
they
speak
of
"
play
charade
,
"
but
in
my
ignorance
I
do
not
understand
the
term

<EOS>
the

Meantime

Mr.

have
again
summon
the

round
him
,
and
be
select
certain
of
their

Miss

say
he
:
<EOS>
afterwards
he

the
two
Misses
Eshton
,
and
Mrs.
Dent

<EOS>
He
look
at
me
:
<EOS>
I
happen
to
be
near
him
,
as
I
have
be
fasten
the
clasp
of
Mrs.

bracelet

which
have

<EOS>
"
Will
you
play
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
insist
,
which
I
rather
fear
he
would
have
do
;
he
allow
me
to
return
quietly
to
my
usual
seat
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
his
aid
now
withdraw
behind
the
curtain
:
the
other
party
,
which
be
head
by
Colonel
Dent
,
sit
down
on
the
crescent
of
chair
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
gentleman
,
Mr.
Eshton
,
observe
me
,
seem
to
propose
that
I
should
be
ask
to
join
them
;
but
Lady
Ingram
instantly
negative
the
notion
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
hear
her
say
:
"
<EOS>
she
look
too
stupid
for
any
game
of
the
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ere
long
a
bell
tinkle
,
and
the
curtain
draw
up
.
<EOS>
within
the
arch
,
the
bulky
figure
of
Sir
George
Lynn
,
whom
Mr.
Rochester
have
likewise
choose
,
be
see
envelop
in
a
white
sheet
:
before
him
,
on
a
table
,
lie
open
a
large
book
;
and
at
his
side
stand
Amy
Eshton
,
drape
in
Mr.
Rochester
's
cloak
,
and
hold
a
book
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
somebody
,
unseen
,
rang
the
bell
merrily
;
then
Adele
(
who
have
insist
on
be
one
of
her
guardian
's
party
)
,
bound
forward
,
scatter
round
her
the
content
of
a
basket
of
flower
she
carry
on
her
arm
.
<EOS>
then
appear
the
magnificent
figure
of
Miss
Ingram
,
clothe
in
white
,
a
long
veil
on
her
head
,
and
a
wreath
of
rose
round
her
brow
;
by
her
side
walk
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
together
they
draw
near
the
table
.
<EOS>
They
knelt
;
while
Mrs.
Dent
and
Louisa
Eshton
,
dress
also
in
white
,
take
up
their
station
behind
them
.
<EOS>
a
ceremony
follow
,
in
dumb
show
,
in
which
it
be
easy
to
recognise
the
pantomime
of
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
at
its
termination
,
Colonel
Dent
and
his
party
consult
in
whisper
for
two
minute
,
then
the
Colonel
call
out
    
"
Bride
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
bow
,
and
the
curtain
fall
.
  
<EOS>
a
considerable
interval
elapse
before
it
again
rise
.
<EOS>
Its
second
rising
display
a
more
elaborately
prepared
scene
than
the
last
.
<EOS>
the
drawing-
room
,
as
I
have
before
observe
,
be
raise
two
step
above
the
dining-
room
,
and
on
the
top
of
the
upper
step
,
place
a
yard
or
two
back
within
the
room
,
appear
a
large
marble
basin
 
which
I
recognise
as
an
ornament
of
the
conservatory
 
where
it
usually
stand
,
surround
by
exotic
,
and
tenant
by
gold
fish
 
and
whence
it
must
have
be
transport
with
some
trouble
,
on
account
of
its
size
and
weight
.
  
<EOS>
seat
on
the
carpet
,
by
the
side
of
this
basin
,
be
see
Mr.
Rochester
,
costume
in
shawl
,
with
a
turban
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
dark
eye
and
swarthy
skin
and
Paynim
feature
suit
the
costume
exactly
:
he
look
the
very
model
of
an
eastern
emir
,
an
agent
or
a
victim
of
the
bowstring
.
<EOS>
presently
advance
into
view
Miss
Ingram
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
be
attire
in
oriental
fashion
:
a
crimson
scarf
tie
sash
-
like
round
the
waist
:
an
embroidered
handkerchief
knot
about
her
temple
;
her
beautifully
-
mould
arm
bare
,
one
of
them
upraised
in
the
act
of
support
a
pitcher
,
poise
gracefully
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
both
her
cast
of
form
and
feature
,
her
complexion
and
her
general
air
,
suggest
the
idea
of
some
israelitish
princess
of
the
patriarchal
day
;
and
such
be
doubtless
the
character
she
intend
to
represent
.
  
<EOS>
She
approach
the
basin
,
and
bent
over
it
as
if
to
fill
her
pitcher
;
she
again
lift
it
to
her
head
.
<EOS>
the
personage
on
the
well
-
brink
now
seem
to
accost
her
;
to
make
some
request
:
 
<EOS>
"
She
haste
,
let
down
her
pitcher
on
her
hand
,
and
give
him
to
drink
.
"
<EOS>
from
the
bosom
of
his
robe
he
then
produce
a
casket
,
open
it
and
show
magnificent
bracelet
and
earring
;
she
act
astonishment
and
admiration
;
kneeling
,
he
lay
the
treasure
at
her
foot
;
incredulity
and
delight
be
express
by
her
look
and
gesture
;
the
stranger
fasten
the
bracelet
on
her
arm
and
the
ring
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
Eliezer
and
Rebecca
:
the
camel
only
be
want
.
  
<EOS>
the
divine
party
again
lay
their
head
together
:
apparently
they
could
not
agree
about
the
word
or
syllable
the
scene
illustrate
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Dent
,
their
spokesman
,
demand
"
the
tableau
of
the
whole
;
"
whereupon
the
curtain
again
descend
.
  
<EOS>
on
its
third
rise
only
a
portion
of
the
drawing
-
room
be
disclose
;
the
rest
being
conceal
by
a
screen
,
hang
with
some
sort
of
dark
and
coarse
drapery
.
<EOS>
the
marble
basin
be
remove
;
in
its
place
,
stand
a
deal
table
and
a
kitchen
chair
:
these
object
be
visible
by
a
very
dim
light
proceed
from
a
horn
lantern
,
the
wax
candle
be
all
extinguish
.
  
<EOS>
amidst
this
sordid
scene
,
sit
a
man
with
his
clenched
hand
rest
on
his
knee
,
and
his
eye
bent
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
know
Mr.
Rochester
;
though
the
begrimed
face
,
the
disorder
dress
(
his
coat
hang
loose
from
one
arm
,
as
if
it
have
be
almost
tear
from
his
back
in
a
scuffle
)
,
the
desperate
and
scowling
countenance
,
the
rough
,
bristling
hair
may
well
have
disguise
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
move
,
a
chain
clank
;
to
his
wrist
be
attach
fetter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bridewell
!
"
exclaim
Colonel
Dent
,
and
the
charade
be
solve
.
  
<EOS>
a
sufficient
interval
have
elapse
for
the
performer
to
resume
their
ordinary
costume
,
they
re
-
enter
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
lead
in
Miss
Ingram
;
she
be
compliment
him
on
his
acting
.
  
<EOS>
"
do

say
she
,
"
that

of
the

I
like

<EOS>
oh

have
you
but
live
a
few
year
earlier
,
what
a
gallant
gentleman

highwayman
you
would
have
make
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
all
the
soot
wash
from
my
face

"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
turn
it
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
yes
:
the
more
be
the
pity
!
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
become
to
your
complexion
than
that
ruffian
's
rouge
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
would
like
a
hero
of
the
road
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
an
english
hero
of
the
road
would
be
the
next
good
thing
to
an
italian
bandit
;
and
that
could
only
be
surpass
by
a
Levantine
pirate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
whatever
I
be
,
remember
you
be
my
wife
;
we
be
marry
an
hour
since
,
in
the
presence
of
all
these
witness
.
"
<EOS>
She
giggle
,
and
her
colour
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Dent
<EOS>
,
"
continue
Mr.
Rochester
,
"
it
be
your
turn
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
the
other
party
withdraw
,
he
and
his
band
take
the
vacate
seat
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
place
herself
at
her
leader
's
right
hand
;
the
other
diviner
fill
the
chair
on
each
side
of
him
and
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
now
watch
the
actor
;
I
no
longer
wait
with
interest
for
the
curtain
to
rise
;
my
attention
be
absorb
by
the
spectator
;
my
eye
,
erewhile
fix
on
the
arch
,
be
now
irresistibly
attract
to
the
semicircle
of
chair
.
<EOS>
what
charade
Colonel
Dent
and
his
party
play
,
what
word
they
choose
,
how
they
acquit
themselves
,
<EOS>
I
no
longer
remember
;
but
I
still
see
the
consultation
which
follow
each
scene
:
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
turn
to
Miss
Ingram
,
and
Miss
Ingram
to
him
;
I
see
her
incline
her
head
towards
him
,
till
the
jetty
curls
almost
touch
his
shoulder
and
wave
against
his
cheek
;
I
hear
their
mutual
whispering
;
I
recall
their
interchange
glance
;
and
something
even
of
the
feeling
rouse
by
the
spectacle
return
in
memory
at
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
,
reader
,
that
I
have
learn
to
love
Mr.
Rochester
:
I
could
not
unlove
him
now
,
merely
because
I
find
that
he
have
cease
to
notice
me
 
because
I
may
pass
hour
in
his
presence
,
and
he
would
never
once
turn
his
eye
in
my
direction
 
because
I
see
all
his
attention
appropriate
by
a
great
lady
,
who
scorn
to
touch
me
with
the
hem
of
her
robe
as
she
pass
;
who
,
if
ever
her
dark
and
imperious
eye
fall
on
me
by
chance
,
would
withdraw
it
instantly
as
from
an
object
too
mean
to
merit
observation
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
unlove
him
,
because
I
feel
sure
he
would
soon
marry
this
very
lady
 
because
I
read
daily
in
her
a
proud
security
in
his
intention
respect
her
 
because
I
witness
hourly
in
him
a
style
of
courtship
which
,
if
careless
and
choose
rather
to
be
seek
than
to
seek
,
be
yet
,
in
its
very
carelessness
,
captivating
,
and
in
its
very
pride
,
irresistible
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
cool
or
banish
love
in
these
circumstance
,
though
much
to
create
despair
.
<EOS>
much
too
,
you
will
think
,
reader
,
to
engender
jealousy
:
<EOS>
if
a
woman
,
in
my
position
,
could
presume
to
be
jealous
of
a
woman
in
Miss
Ingram
's
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
jealous
:
or
very
rarely
;
 
the
nature
of
the
pain
I
suffer
could
not
be
explain
by
that
word
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
be
a
mark
beneath
jealousy
<EOS>
:
she
be
too
inferior
to
excite
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
pardon
the
seem
paradox
<EOS>
;
I
mean
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
showy
,
but
she
be
not
genuine
:
she
have
a
fine
person
,
many
brilliant
attainment
;
but
her
mind
be
poor
,
her
heart
barren
by
nature
:
<EOS>
nothing
bloom
spontaneously
on
that
soil
;
no
unforced
natural
fruit
delight
by
its
freshness
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
good
;
she
be
not
original
:
she
use
to
repeat
sound
phrase
from
book
:
she
never
offer
,
nor
have
,
an
opinion
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
advocate
a
high
tone
of
sentiment
;
but
she
do
not
know
the
sensation
of
sympathy
and
pity
;
tenderness
and
truth
be
not
in
her
.
<EOS>
too
often
she
betray
this
,
by
the
undue
vent
she
give
to
a
spiteful
antipathy
she
have
conceive
against
little
Adele
:
push
her
away
with
some
contumelious
epithet
if
she
happen
to
approach
her
;
sometimes
order
her
from
the
room
,
and
always
treat
her
with
coldness
and
acrimony
.
<EOS>
other
eye
besides
mine
watch
these
manifestation
of
character
 
watch
them
closely
,
keenly
,
shrewdly
.
<EOS>
yes
;
the
future
bridegroom
,
Mr.
Rochester
himself
,
exercise
over
his
intend
a
ceaseless
surveillance
;
and
it
be
from
this
sagacity
 
this
guardedness
of
his
 
this
perfect
,
clear
consciousness
of
his
fair
one
's
defect
 
this
obvious
absence
of
passion
in
his
sentiment
towards
her
,
that
my
ever-
<EOS>
torture
pain
arise
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
he
be
go
to
marry
her
,
for
family
,
perhaps
political
reason
,
because
her
rank
and
connection
suit
him
;
I
feel
he
have
not
give
her
his
love
,
and
that
her
qualification
be
ill
adapt
to
win
from
him
that
treasure
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
point
 
<EOS>
this
be
where
the
nerve
be
touch
and
tease
 
<EOS>
this
be
where
the
fever
be
sustain
and
feed
:
<EOS>
_
she
could
not
charm
him
_
.
  
<EOS>
if
she
have
manage
the
victory
at
once
,
and
he
have
yield
and
sincerely
lay
his
heart
at
her
foot
,
I
should
have
cover
my
face
,
turn
to
the
wall
,
and
(
figuratively
)
have
die
to
them
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Ingram
have
be
a
good
and
noble
woman
,
endow
with
force
,
fervour
,
kindness
,
sense
,
I
should
have
have
one
vital
struggle
with
two
tiger
 
jealousy
and
despair
:
then
,
my
heart
tear
out
and
devour
,
I
should
have
admire
her
 
acknowledge
her
excellence
,
and
be
quiet
for
the
rest
of
my
day
:
and
the
more
absolute
her
superiority
,
the
deep
would
have
be
my
admiration
 
the
more
truly
tranquil
my
quiescence
.
<EOS>
but
as
matter
really
stand
,
to
watch
Miss
Ingram
's
effort
at
fascinate
Mr.
Rochester
,
to
witness
their
repeat
failure
 
herself
unconscious
that
they
do
fail
<EOS>
;
vainly
fancy
that
each
shaft
launch
hit
the
mark
,
and
infatuatedly
plume
herself
on
success
,
when
her
pride
and
self
-
complacency
repel
further
and
further
what
she
wish
to
allure
 
to
witness
_
<EOS>
this
_
,
be
to
be
at
once
under
ceaseless
excitation
and
ruthless
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
because
,
when
she
fail
,
I
see
how
she
may
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
arrow
that
continually
glance
off
from
Mr.
Rochester
's
breast
and
fall
harmless
at
his
foot
,
may
,
I
know
,
if
shoot
by
a
sure
hand
,
have
quiver
keen
in
his
proud
heart
 
have
call
love
into
his
stern
eye
,
and
softness
into
his
sardonic
face
;
or
,
better
still
,
without
weapon
a
silent
conquest
may
have
be
win
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
can
she
not
influence
him
more
,
when
she
be
privileged
to
draw
so
near
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
myself
.
"
<EOS>
surely
she
can
not
truly
like
him
,
or
not
like
him
with
true
affection
!
<EOS>
if
she
do
,
she
nee
not
coin
her
smile
so
lavishly
,
flash
her
glance
so
unremittingly
,
manufacture
air
<EOS>
so
elaborate
,
grace
so
multitudinous
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
she
may
,
by
merely
sit
quietly
at
his
side
,
say
little
and
look
less
,
get
nigher
his
heart
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
in
his
face
a
far
different
expression
from
that
which
harden
it
now
while
she
be
so
vivaciously
accost
him
;
but
then
it
come
of
itself
:
it
be
not
elicit
by
meretricious
art
and
calculated
manoeuvre
;
and
one
have
but
to
accept
it
 
to
answer
what
he
ask
without
pretension
,
to
address
him
when
needful
without
grimace
 
<EOS>
and
it
increase
and
grow
kind
and
more
genial
,
and
warm
one
like
a
foster
sunbeam
.
<EOS>
how
will
she
manage
to
please
him
when
they
be
married
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
will
manage
it
;
and
yet
it
may
be
manage
;
and
his
wife
may
,
I
verily
believe
,
be
the
very
happy
woman
the
sun
shine
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
say
anything
condemnatory
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
project
of
marry
for
interest
and
connection
.
<EOS>
It
surprise
me
when
I
first
discover
that
such
be
his
intention
<EOS>
:
I
have
think
him
a
man
unlikely
to
be
influence
by
motive
so
commonplace
in
his
choice
of
a
wife
;
but
the
long
I
consider
the
position
,
education
,
&
c.
,
of
the
party
,
the
less
I
feel
justified
in
judge
and
blame
either
him
or
Miss
Ingram
for
act
in
conformity
to
idea
and
principle
instill
into
them
,
doubtless
,
from
their
childhood
.
<EOS>
all
their
class
hold
these
principle
<EOS>
:
I
suppose
,
then
,
they
have
reason
for
hold
them
such
as
I
could
not
fathom
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
,
be
I
a
gentleman
like
him
<EOS>
,
I
would
take
to
my
bosom
only
such
a
wife
as
I
could
love
;
but
the
very
obviousness
of
the
advantage
to
the
husband
's
own
happiness
offer
by
this
plan
convince
me
that
there
must
be
argument
against
its
general
adoption
of
which
I
be
quite
ignorant
:
otherwise
I
feel
sure
all
the
world
would
act
as
I
wish
to
act
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
other
point
,
as
well
as
this
,
I
be
grow
very
lenient
to
my
master
:
<EOS>
I
be
forget
all
his
fault
,
for
which
I
have
once
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
.
<EOS>
It
have
formerly
be
my
endeavour
to
study
all
side
of
his
character
:
to
take
the
bad
with
the
good
;
and
from
the
just
weighing
of
both
,
to
form
an
equitable
judgment
.
<EOS>
now
I
see
no
bad
.
<EOS>
the
sarcasm
that
have
repel
,
the
harshness
that
have
startle
me
once
,
be
only
like
keen
condiment
in
a
choice
dish
:
their
presence
be
pungent
,
but
their
absence
would
be
feel
as
comparatively
insipid
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
vague
something
 
be
it
a
sinister
or
a
sorrowful
,
<EOS>
a
designing
or
a
desponding
expression
?
 
<EOS>
that
open
upon
a
careful
observer
,
now
and
then
,
in
his
eye
,
and
close
again
before
one
could
fathom
the
strange
depth
partially
disclose
;
<EOS>
that
something
which
use
to
make
me
fear
and
shrink
,
as
if
I
have
be
wander
amongst
volcanic
-
look
hill
,
and
have
suddenly
feel
the
ground
quiver
and
see
it
gape
:
that
something
,
I
,
at
interval
,
beheld
still
;
and
with
throb
heart
,
but
not
with
palsy
nerve
.
<EOS>
instead
of
wish
to
shun
,
I
long
only
to
dare
 
to
divine
it
;
and
I
think
Miss
Ingram
happy
,
because
one
day
she
may
look
into
the
abyss
at
her
leisure
,
explore
its
secret
and
analyse
their
nature
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
,
while
I
think
only
of
my
master
and
his
future
bride
 
see
only
them
,
hear
only
their
discourse
,
and
consider
only
their
movement
of
importance
 
the
rest
of
the
party
be
occupy
with
their
own
separate
interest
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
the
Ladies
Lynn
and
Ingram
continue
to
consort
in
solemn
conference
,
where
they
nod
their
two
turban
at
each
other
,
and
hold
up
their
four
hand
in
confront
gesture
of
surprise
,
or
mystery
,
or
horror
,
accord
to
the
theme
on
which
their
gossip
run
,
like
a
pair
of
magnify
puppet

<EOS>
Mild
Mrs.
Dent
talk
with
good

natured
Mrs.

and
the
two

bestow
a
courteous
word

on
me

<EOS>
Sir

Messrs.

listen
languidly
to
the
gallant

<EOS>
sometimes
all
,
as
with
one
consent

suspend
their
by

play
to
observe

to

Mr.
Rochester

him
 
<EOS>
Miss

be
the
life

<EOS>
if

absent
from
the
room
an
hour

a
perceptible
dulness
seem
to
steal
over
the
spirit
of
his
guest
;
and
his
re

entrance
be
sure
to
give
a
fresh
impulse
to
the
vivacity
of
conversation

<EOS>
the
want
of
his
animate
influence
appear
to
be
peculiarly
feel
one
day
that
he
have
be
summon
to
Millcote
on
business

and
be
not
likely
to
return
till
late

<EOS>
the
afternoon

wet

a
walk
the

have
propose
to
take
to

a
gipsy
camp

lately
pitch
on

beyond
Hay

be
consequently
defer

some

the
young

,
together
with

be
play
billiard
in
the
billiard

<EOS>
the
dowager
Ingram
and
Lynn
seek
solace
in
a
quiet
game
at

.
<EOS>
Blanche
Ingram
,
after
have
repel
,
by
supercilious
taciturnity
,
some
effort
of
Mrs.
Dent
and
Mrs.
Eshton
to
draw
her
into
conversation
,
have
first
murmur
over
some
sentimental
tune
and
air
on
the
piano
,
and
then
,
have
fetch
a
novel
from
the
library
,
have
fling
herself
in
haughty
listlessness
on
a
sofa
,
and
prepare
to
beguile
,
by
the
spell
of
fiction
,
the
tedious
hour
of
absence
.
<EOS>
the
room
and
the
house
be
silent
:
only
now
and
then
the
merriment
of
the
billiard
-
player
be
hear
from
above
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
verge
on
dusk
,
and
the
clock
have
already
give
warning
of
the
hour
to
dress
for
dinner
,
when
little
Adele
,
who
knelt
by
me
in

room
window

seat
,
suddenly
exclaim
    
"
Voila
,
Monsieur
Rochester
,
qui
revient
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
turn
,
and
Miss
Ingram
dart
forwards
from
her
sofa
:
<EOS>
the
other
,
too
,
look
up
from
their
several
occupation
;
for
at
the
same
time
a
crunching
of
wheel
and
a
splash
tramp
of
horse

hoofs
become
audible
on
the
wet

<EOS>
a

chaise

<EOS>
"
what

Miss

"
<EOS>
He
ride
Mesrour
(
the
black

,
do
he
not
,
when
he
go
out
?
<EOS>
and
Pilot
be
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
what
have
he
do
with
the
animal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
say
this
,
she
approach
her
tall
person
and
ample
garment
so
near
the
window
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
bend
back
almost
to
the
breaking
of
my
spine
:
in
her
eagerness
she
do
not
observe
me
at
first
,
but
when
she
do
,
she
curl
her
lip
and
move
to
another
casement
.
<EOS>
the
post
-
chaise
stop
;
the
driver
ring
the
door
-
bell
,
and
a
gentleman
alight
attire
in
travel
garb
;
but
it
be
not
Mr.
Rochester
;
it
be
a
tall
,
fashionable
-
looking
man
,
a
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
provoking
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Miss
Ingram
:
"
you
tiresome
monkey
!
"
<EOS>
(
apostrophise
Adele
)
,
"
who
perch
you
up
in
the
window
to
give
false
intelligence
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
cast
on
me
an
angry
glance
,
as
if
I
be
in
fault
.
  
<EOS>
some
parleying
be
audible
in
the
hall
,
and
soon
the
new
-
comer
enter
.
<EOS>
He
bow
to
Lady
Ingram
,
as
deem
her
the
eld
lady
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
appear
I
come
at
an
inopportune
time
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
when
my
friend
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
be
from
home
;
but
I
arrive
from
a
very
long
journey
,
and
I
think
I
may
presume
so
far
on
old
and
intimate
acquaintance
as
to
instal
myself
here
till
he
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
manner
be
polite
;
his
accent
,
in
speak
,
strike
me
as
be
somewhat
unusual
,
 
not
precisely
foreign
,
but
still
not
altogether
English
:
his
age
may
be
about
Mr.
Rochester
's
,
 
between
thirty
and
forty
;
his
complexion
be
singularly
sallow
:
otherwise
he
be
a
fine
-
looking
man
,
at
first
sight
especially
.
<EOS>
on
close
examination
,
you
detect
something
in
his
face
that
displeased
,
or
rather
that
fail
to
please
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
regular
,
but
too
relaxed
:
his
eye
be
large
and
well
cut
,
but
the
life
look
out
of
it
be
a
tame
,
vacant
life
 
<EOS>
at
least
so
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
the
sound
of
the
dressing
-
bell
disperse
the
party
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
after
dinner
that
I
see
him
again
:
he
then
seem
quite
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
but
I
like
his
physiognomy
even
less
than
before
:
it
strike
me
as
be
at
the
same
time
unsettle
and
inanimate
.
<EOS>
His
eye
wander
,
and
have
no
meaning
in
its
wandering
:
this
give
him
an
odd
look
,
such
as
I
never
remember
to
have
see
.
<EOS>
for
a
handsome
and
not
an
unamiable
-
looking
man
,
he
repel
me
exceedingly
:
there
be
no
power
in
that
smooth
-
skinned
face
of
a
full
oval
shape
:
no
firmness
in
that
aquiline
nose
and
small
cherry
mouth
;
there
be
no
thought
on
the
low
,
even
forehead
;
no
command
in
that
blank
,
brown
eye
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
sit
in
my
usual
nook
,
and
look
at
him
with
the
light
of
the
girandole
on
the
mantelpiece
beam
full
over
him
 
for
he
occupy
an
arm
-
chair
draw
close
to
the
fire
,
and
keep
shrink
still
near
,
as
if
he
be
cold
,
I
compare
him
with
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
I
think
(
with
deference
be
it
speak
)
<EOS>
the
contrast
could
not
be
much
great
between
a
sleek
gander
and
a
fierce
falcon
:
between
a
meek
sheep
and
the
rough
-
coat
keen
-
eyed
dog
,
its
guardian
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
speak
of
Mr.
Rochester
as
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
a
curious
friendship
theirs
must
have
be
:
a
pointed
illustration
,
indeed
,
of
the
old
adage
that
"
extreme
meet
.
"
  
<EOS>
two
or
three
of
the
gentleman
sit
near
him
,
and
I
catch
at
time
scrap
of
their
conversation
across
the
room
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
could
not
make
much
sense
of
what
I
hear
;
for
the
discourse
of
Louisa
Eshton
and
Mary
Ingram
,
who
sit
nearer
to
me
,
confuse
the
fragmentary
sentence
that
reach
me
at
interval
.
<EOS>
these
last
be
discuss
the
stranger
;
they
both
call
him
"
a
beautiful
man
.
"
<EOS>
Louisa
say
he
be
"
a
love
of
a
creature
,
"
and
she
"
adore
him
;
"
and
Mary
instance
his
"
pretty
little
mouth
,
and
nice
nose
,
"
as
her
ideal
of
the
charming
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
a
sweet
-
tempered
forehead
he
have
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Louisa
,
 
"
so
smooth
 
none
of
those
frown
irregularity
I
dislike
so
much
;
and
such
a
placid
eye
and
smile
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
my
great
relief
,
Mr.
Henry
Lynn
summon
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
to
settle
some
point
about
the
deferred
excursion
to
Hay
Common
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
able
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
the
group
by
the
fire
,
and
I
presently
gather
that
the
new
-
comer
be
call
Mr.
Mason
<EOS>
;
then
I
learn
that
he
be
but
just
arrive
in
England
,
and
that
he
come
from
some
hot
country
:
which
be
the
reason
,
doubtless
,
<EOS>
his
face
be
so
sallow
,
and
that
he
sit
so
near
the
hearth
,
and
wear
a
surtout
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
presently
the
word
Jamaica
,
Kingston
,
Spanish
Town
,
indicate
the
West
Indies
as
his
residence
;
and
it
be
with
no
little
surprise
I
gather
,
ere
long
,
that
he
have
there
first
see
and
become
acquainted
with
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
He
speak
of
his
friend
's
dislike
of
the
burn
heat
,
the
hurricane
,
and
rainy
season
of
that
region
.
<EOS>
I
know
Mr.
Rochester
have
be
a
traveller
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
say
so
;
but
I
think
the
continent
of
Europe
have
bound
his
wandering
;
till
now
I
have
never
hear
a
hint
give
of
visit
to
more
distant
shore
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
ponder
these
thing
,
when
an
incident
,
and
a
somewhat
unexpected
one
,
break
the
thread
of
my
musing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
,
shiver
as
some
one
chance
to
open
the
door
,
ask
for
more
coal
to
be
put
on
the
fire
,
which
have
burn
out
its
flame
,
though
its
mass
of
cinder
still
shine
hot
and
red
.
<EOS>
the
footman
who
bring
the
coal
,
in
go
out
,
stop
near
Mr.
Eshton
's
chair
,
and
say
something
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
of
which
I
hear
only
the
word
,
"
old
woman
,
"
 
"
quite
troublesome
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
her
she
shall
be
put
in
the
stock
if
she
do
not
take
herself
off
,
"
reply
the
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
stop
!
"
<EOS>
interrupt
Colonel
Dent
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
send
her
away
,
Eshton
;
we
may
turn
the
thing
to
account
;
better
consult
the

"
<EOS>
and
speak
aloud
,
he
continue
 
<EOS>
"

you

Common

Would

coldness

Miss

not

<EOS>
really
your
organ

wonder

you
seem

by
the
importance

you
all
 
my
good

ascribe
to

absolutely
to
believe
we

a
genuine
witch
in

house

who
be
in
close
alliance
with
the
old
gentleman

I
have
see
a
gipsy
vagabond

the
science

palmistry

tell
me
what
such
people
usually
tell

My
whim
be
gratify

I

Mr.

do
well

put
the
hag

stock

morrow
morning

as
he
threaten

<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
take
a
book
,
leant
back
in
her
chair
,
and
so
decline
further
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
watch
her
for
nearly
half
-
an
-
hour
:
during
all
that
time
she
never
turn
a
page
,
and
her
face
grow
momently
dark
,
more
dissatisfied
,
and
more
sourly
expressive
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
She
have
obviously
not
hear
anything
to
her
advantage
:
and
it
seem
to
me
,
from
her
prolonged
fit
of
gloom
and
taciturnity
,
that
she
herself
,
notwithstanding
her
profess
indifference
,
attach
undue
importance

a
negotiation
be
open
through
the

after
much
pacing
to

with

<EOS>
Their
visit
be
not
so
still
as
Miss
Ingram
's
have
be
:
we
hear
hysterical
giggling
and
little
shriek
proceed
from
the
library
;
and
at
the
end
of
about
twenty
minute
they
burst
the
door
open
,
and
come
run
across
the
hall
,
as
if
they
be
half
-
scared
out
of
their
wit

further
explanation

describe

ornament

their
boudoir
at
home

keepsake
that
different
relation
have
present
to

<EOS>
They
affirm
that
she
have
even
divine
their
thought

have
whisper
in
the
ear
of
each
the
name
of
the

inform

here
the

interpose
with
earnest
petition
to
be
further
enlighten
on
these
two
last

name
point
;
but
they
get
only
blush
,
ejaculation
,
tremor
,
and
titter
,
in
return
for
their
importunity

the
matron
,
meantime
,
offer
vinaigrette

wield
fan

again

again
reiterate
the
expression

agitated
fair

in

I
hear
a

a
little
black
book
,
like
a
prayer
-
book
,
by
the
light
of
the
blaze
:
she
mutter
the
word
to
herself
,
as
most
old
woman
do
,
while
she
read
;
she
do
not
desist
immediately
on
my
entrance
:
<EOS>
it
appear
she
wish
to
finish
a
paragraph
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
on
the
rug
and
warm
my
hand
,
which
be
rather
cold
with
sit
at
a
distance
from
the
drawing
-
room
fire
.
<EOS>
I
feel
now
as
compose
as
ever
<EOS>
I
do
in
my
life
:
there
be
nothing
indeed
in
the
gipsy
's
appearance
to
trouble
one
's
calm
.
<EOS>
She
shut
her
book
and
slowly
look
up
;
her
hat
-
brim
partially
shade
her
face
,
yet
I
could
see
,
as
she
raise
it
,
that
it
be
a
strange
one
.
<EOS>
It
look
all
brown
and
black
:
<EOS>
elf-
lock
bristle
out
from
beneath
a
white
band
which
pass
under
her
chin
,
and
come
half
over
her
cheek
,
or
rather
jaw
:
her
eye
confront
me
at
once
,
with
a
bold
and
direct
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
you
want
your
fortune
tell
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
in
a
voice
as
decide
as
her
glance
,
as
harsh
as
her
feature
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
about
it
,
mother
;
you
may
please
yourself
:
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
warn
you
,
I
have
no
faith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
like
your
impudence
to
say
so
:
<EOS>
I
expect
it
of
you
;
I
hear
it
in
your
step
as
you
cross
the
threshold
.

<EOS>
"
do
you
?
<EOS>
You
have
a
quick
ear

a
quick
eye

quick
brain

You
need
them
all
in
your
trade

"
  
<EOS>

I
do
;
especially
when
I
have
customer
like
you
to
deal
with

tremble

turn
pale

my

<EOS>
the
old
crone

nichere

a
laugh
under
her
bonnet
and
bandage
;
she
then
draw
out
a
short
black
pipe
,
and
light
<EOS>
it
begin
to
smoke
.
<EOS>
have
indulge
a
while
in
this
sedative
,
she
raise
her
bent
body
,
take
the
pipe
from
her
lip
,
and
while
gaze
steadily
at
the
fire
,
say
very
deliberately
 
"
You
be
cold
;
you
be
sick
;
and
you
be
silly

"
  
<EOS>
"
prove
it
,

I
rejoin

<EOS>
"
I
will
,
in
few
word

<EOS>
You
be
cold
,
because
you
be
alone
:
no
contact
strike
the
fire
from
you
that
be
in
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
sick
;
because
the
good
of
feeling
,
the
high
and
the
sweetest
give
to
man
,
keep
far
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
silly
,
because
,
suffer
as
you
may
,
you
will
not
beckon
it
to
approach
,
nor
will
you
stir
one
step
to
meet
it
where
it
wait
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
again
put
her
short
black
pipe
to
her
lip
,
and
renew
her
smoking
with
vigour
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
all

I
give
her
a
shilling
:

it
into
an
old
stocking

foot

take
out

pocket

tie
it
round

return
it

approach
her
face
to
the
palm

and
pore
over
it
without

fine

say
she
.

can
make
nothing

in

on

about

I
knelt
within
half
a
yard
of
her
.

She
stir
the
fire

light
break
from
the
disturbed
coal

glare

up

,
as
I
be

:
sit
in

window

do
you
think
of
nothing

your

school

you

company

one
from

I
do
frequently

<EOS>
She
have
lay
it
carefully
on
one
side
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
depend
on
yourself
to
stretch
out
your
hand
,
and
take
it
up
:
but
whether
you
will
do
so
,
be
the
problem
I
study
.
<EOS>
Kneel
again
on
the
rug
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
keep
me
long
;
the
fire
scorch
me
.

<EOS>
{
She
do
not
stoop
towards
me
,
but
only
gaze
,
lean
back
in
her
chair

<EOS>
I
knelt
.

She

She

"
the
flame
flicker
in
the
eye
;
the
eye
shine
like
dew
;
it
look
soft
and
full
of
feeling
;
it
smile
at
my
jargon
:
<EOS>
it

susceptible
;
impression
follow
impression
through
its
clear
sphere
;
where
it
cease
to
smile
,
it
be
sad
;
an
unconscious
lassitude
weigh
on
the
lid
:
that
signify
melancholy
result
from
loneliness
.
<EOS>
It
turn
from
me
;
it
will
not
suffer
further
scrutiny
;
it
seem
to
deny
,
by
a
mock
glance
,
the
truth
of
the
discovery
I
have
already
make
,
 
to
disown
the
charge
both
of
sensibility
and
chagrin
:
its
pride
and
reserve
only
confirm
me
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
the
eye
be
favourable
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
the
mouth
,
it
delight
at
time
in
laughter
;
it
be
dispose
to
impart
all
that
the
brain
conceive
;
though
I
daresay
it
would
be
silent
on
much
the
heart
experience
.
<EOS>
mobile
and
flexible
,
it
be
never
intend
to
be
compress
in
the
eternal
silence
of
solitude
:
it
be
a
mouth
which
should
speak
much
and
smile
often
,
and
have
human
affection
for
its
interlocutor
.
<EOS>
that
feature
too
be
propitious
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
enemy
to
a
fortunate
issue
but
in
the
brow
;
and
that
brow
profess
to
say
,
 
"
I
can
live
alone
,
if
self

respect
,
and
circumstance
require
me
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
sell
my
soul
to
buy
bliss
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
inward
treasure
bear
with
me
,
which
can
keep
me
alive
if
all
extraneous
delight
should
be
withhold
,
or
offer
only
at
a
price
I
can
not
afford
to
give

<EOS>
the

declare

reason
sit
firm
and
hold
the
rein
,
and
she
will
not
let
the
feeling
burst
away
and
hurry
her
to
wild
chasm
.
<EOS>
the
passion
may
rage
furiously
,
like
true
heathen
,
as
they
be
;
and
the
desire
may
imagine
all
sort
of
vain
thing
:
but
judgment
shall
still
have
the
last
word
in
every
argument
,
and
the
cast
vote
in
every
decision
.
<EOS>
strong
wind
,
earthquake
-
shock
,
and
fire
may
pass
by
:
but
I
shall
follow
the
guiding
of
that
still
small
voice
which
interpret
the
dictate
of
conscience

"
  
<EOS>

well

;
your
declaration
shall
be
respect

<EOS>
I
have
form
my
plan
 
<EOS>
right
plan

I
deem
them
 
and
in
them
I
have
attend
to
the
claim
of
conscience

the
counsel

<EOS>
I
know
how
soon
youth
would
fade
and
bloom
perish

cup

one
dreg

I
do
not
want
sacrifice

sorrow

dissolution
 
<EOS>
such
be
not
my
taste

<EOS>
I
wish
to
foster

not

blight
 
to
earn
gratitude
,
not
to
wring
tear
of
blood
 
no
,
nor
of
brine

my
harvest
must
be
in
smile
,
in
endearment
,
in
sweet
 
that
will
do

<EOS>
I
think
I
rave
in
a
kind
of
exquisite
delirium
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
now
to
protract
this
moment

I
dare
not

<EOS>
so
far
I
have

myself
thoroughly

further
may
try

beyond

rise
,
Miss

play

I
wake

do
I
dream
still

<EOS>
the
old
woman
's
voice
have
change
:
her
accent
,
her
gesture
,
and
all
be
familiar
to
me
as
my
own
face
in
a
glass
 
as
the
speech
of
my
own
tongue

<EOS>
I
get
up
,
but
do
not
go
.
<EOS>
I
look
;
I
stir
the
fire
,
and
I
look
again
:
but
she
draw
her
bonnet
and
her
bandage
closer
about
her
face
,
and
again
beckon
me
to
depart
.
<EOS>
the
flame
illuminate
her
hand
stretch
out
:
rouse
now
,
and
on
the
alert
for
discovery
,
I
at
once
notice
that
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
more
the
withered
limb
of
eld
than
my
own
;
it
be
a
rounded
supple
member
,
with
smooth
finger
,
symmetrically
turn
;
a
broad
ring
flash
on
the
little
finger
,
and
stoop
forward
,
I
look
at
it
,
and
see
a
gem
I
have
see
a
hundred
time
before
.
<EOS>
again
I
look
at
the
face
;
which
be
no
longer
turn
from
me
 
on

contrary

the
bonnet
be
doff
,

bandage
displace
,

head
advance

<EOS>
"
well
,
Jane
,
do
you
know
me

ask
the
familiar
voice

<EOS>

only
take
off

Mr.

step
out

now

what

out

My

no

some
unaccountable
one

<EOS>
in
short
,
I
believe
you
have
be
try
to
draw
me
out
 
or
in
;
you
have
be
talk
nonsense
to
make
me
talk
nonsense

<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
fair

<EOS>

do
you
forgive
me

I
can
not

all
over

,
on
reflection

I
find
I
have
fall
into
no
great
absurdity

I
shall
try

forgive
you

it
be
not
right

<EOS>
"
oh

you
have
be
very
correct
 
very
careful

sensible

<EOS>
I
reflect
,
and
think
,
on
the
whole
,
I
have
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
comfort
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
have
be
on
my
guard
almost
from
the
beginning
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
something
of
masquerade
I
suspect
.
<EOS>
I
know
gipsy
and
fortune
-
teller
do
not
express
themselves
as
this
seeming
old
woman
have
express
herself
;
besides
I
have
note
her
feign
voice
,
her
anxiety
to
conceal
her
feature
.
<EOS>
but
my
mind
have
be
run
on
Grace
Poole
 
<EOS>
that
live
enigma

that
mystery

mystery

as
I
consider
her

,
and
whisper
in
his
ear
that
Mr.
Rochester
be
come
and
wish
to
see
him
:
show
him
in
here
and
then
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
his
behest
.
<EOS>
the
company
all
stare
at
me
as
I
pass
straight
among
them
.
<EOS>
I
seek
Mr.
Mason
,
deliver
the
message
,
and
precede
him
from
the
room
:
I
usher
him
into
the
library
,
and
then
I
go
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
late
hour
,
after
I
have
be
in
bed
some
time
,
I
hear
the
visitor
repair
to
their
chamber
:
I
distinguish
Mr.
Rochester
's
voice
,
and
hear
him
say
,
"
this
way
,
Mason
;
this
be
your
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
cheerfully
:
<EOS>
the
gay
tone
set
my
heart
at
ease
.
<EOS>
I
be
soon
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
forget
to
draw
my
curtain
,
which
I
usually
do
,
and
also
to
let
down
my
window
-
blind
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
when
the
moon
,
which
be
full
and
bright
(
for
the
night
be
fine
)
,
come
in
her
course
to
that
space
in
the
sky
opposite
my
casement
,
and
look
in
at
me
through
the
unveiled
pane
,
her
glorious
gaze
rouse
me
.
<EOS>
awake
in
the
dead
of
night
,
I
open
my
eye
on
her
disk
 
silver
-
white
and
crystal
clear
.
<EOS>
It
be
beautiful
,
but
too
solemn
;
I
half
rise
,
and
stretch
my
arm
to
draw
the
curtain
.
  
<EOS>
good
God
!
<EOS>
what
a
cry
!
  
<EOS>
the
night
 
its
silence
 
its
rest
,
be
rend
in
twain
by
a
savage
,
a
sharp
,
a
shrilly
sound
that
run
from
end
to
end
of
Thornfield
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
My
pulse
stop
:
my
heart
stand
still
;
my
stretched
arm
be
paralysed
.
<EOS>
the
cry
die
,
and
be
not
renew
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
whatever
be
utter
that
fearful
shriek
could
not
soon
repeat
it
:
not
the
widest
-
wing
condor
on
the
Andes
could
,
twice
in
succession
,
send
out
such
a
yell
from
the
cloud
shroud
his
eyrie
.
<EOS>
the
thing
deliver
such
utterance
must
rest
ere
it
could
repeat
the
effort
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
out
of
the
third
storey
;
for
it
pass
overhead
.
<EOS>
and
overhead
 
yes
,
in
the
room
just
above
my
chamber
-
ceiling
 
<EOS>
I
now
hear
a
struggle
:
<EOS>
a
deadly
one
it
seem
from
the
noise
;
and
a
half
-
smothered
voice
shout
    
"
help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
<EOS>
three
time
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
no
one
come
?
"
<EOS>
it
cry
;
and
then
,
while
the
staggering
and
stamp
go
on
wildly
,
<EOS>
I
distinguish
through
plank
and
plaster
:
    
"
Rochester
!
<EOS>
Rochester
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
a
chamber
-
door
open
:
some
one
run
,
or
rush
,
along
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
another
step
stamp
on
the
flooring
above
and
something
fall
;
and
there
be
silence
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
put
on
some
clothe
,
though
horror
shake
all
my
limb
;
I
issue
from
my
apartment
.
<EOS>
the
sleeper
be
all
arouse
:
ejaculation
,
terrified
murmur
sound
in
every
room
;
door
after
door
unclosed
;
one
look
out
and
another
look
out
;
the
gallery
fill
.
<EOS>
gentleman
and
lady
alike
have
quit
their
bed
;
and
"

<EOS>

demand
confusedly
on

<EOS>
but
for
the
moonlight
they
would
have
be
in
complete
darkness
.
<EOS>
They
run
to
and
fro
;
they
crowd
together
:
<EOS>
some
sob
,
some
stumble
:
the
confusion
be
inextricable
.
  
<EOS>
"
where

"
cry
Colonel

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
and
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
open
,
and
Mr.
Rochester
advance
with
a
candle
:
he
have
just
descend
from
the
upper
storey
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
lady
run
to
him
directly
;
she
seize
his
arm
:
it
be
Miss
Ingram

<EOS>
"

"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do

down
or

"
he
reply
:
for
the
Misses
Eshton
be
cling
about
him
now
;
and
the
two
dowager
,
in
vast
white
wrapper
,
be
bear
down
on
him
like
ship
in
full
sail
.
  
<EOS>
"
all

<EOS>
all

"
<EOS>
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
mere
rehearsal
of
Much
Ado
about
nothing

<EOS>
lady
,
keep
off

or
I
shall
wax
dangerous

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
dangerous
he
look
:
<EOS>
his
black
eye
dart
spark
.
<EOS>
calm
himself
by
an
effort
,
he
add
    
"
a
servant
have
have
the
nightmare
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
excitable
,
nervous
person
:
she
construe
her
dream
into
an
apparition
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
no
doubt
;
and
have
take
a
fit
with
fright
.
<EOS>
now
,
then
,
I
must
see
you
all
back
into
your
room

for
,
till
the
house
be
settle
,
she
can
not

<EOS>
gentleman
,
have
the
goodness
to
set
the
lady
the
example
.
<EOS>
Miss
Ingram
,
I
be
sure
you
will
not
fail
in
evince
superiority
to
idle
terror
.
<EOS>
Amy
and
Louisa
,
return
to
your
nest
like
a
pair
of
dove
,
as
you
be
.
<EOS>
Mesdames
"
(
to
the
dowager
)
,
"
you
will
take
cold
to
a
dead
certainty
,
if
you
stay
in
this
chill
gallery
any
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
by
dint
of
alternate
coax
and
command
,
he
contrive
to
get
them
all
once
more
enclosed
in
their
separate
dormitory
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wait
to
be
order
back
to
mine
,
but
retreat
unnoticed
,
as
unnoticed
I
have
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
not
,
however
,
to
go
to
bed
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
begin
and
dress
myself
carefully
.
<EOS>
the
sound
I
have
hear
after
the
scream
,
and
the
word
that
have
be
utter
,
have
probably
be
hear
only
by
me
;
for
they
have
proceed
from
the
room
above
mine
:
but
they
assure
me
that
it
be
not
a
servant
's
dream
which
have
thus
strike
horror
through
the
house
;
and
that
the
explanation
Mr.
Rochester
have
give
be
merely
an
invention
frame
to
pacify
his
guest
.
<EOS>
I
dress
,
then
,
to
be
ready
for
emergency
.
<EOS>
when
dress
,
I
sit
a
long
time
by
the
window
look
out
over
the
silent
ground
and
silvered
field
and
wait
for
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
some
event
must
follow
the
strange
cry
,
struggle
,
and
call
.
  
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
:
stillness
return
:
each
murmur
and
movement
cease
gradually
,
and
in
about
an
hour
Thornfield
Hall
be
again
as
hush
as
a
desert
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
sleep
and
night
have
resume
their
empire
.
<EOS>
meantime
the
moon
decline
:
she
be
about
to
set
.
<EOS>
not
like
to
sit
in
the
cold
and
darkness
,
I
think
I
would
lie
down
on
my
bed
,
dress
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
leave
the
window
,
and
move
with
little
noise
across
the
carpet
;
as
I
stoop
to
take
off
my
shoe
,
a
cautious
hand
tap
low
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
want
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
up
?
"
ask
the
voice
I
expect
to
hear
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
<EOS>
my
master
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
dress
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
out
,
then
,
quietly
.
"
  
I
obey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
stand
in
the
gallery
hold
a
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
,
"
he
say
:
"
come
this
way
:
take
your
time
,
and
make
no
noise
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
slipper
be
thin
:
I
could
walk
the
matted
floor
as
softly
as
a
cat
.
<EOS>
He
glide
up
the
gallery
and
up
the
stair
,
and
stop
in
the
dark
,
low
corridor
of
the
fateful
third
storey
:
<EOS>
I
have
follow
and
stand
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
a
sponge
in
your
room
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
salt
 
volatile
salt
?
"
  
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
back
and
fetch
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
return
,
seek
the
sponge
on
the
washstand
,
the
salt
in
my
drawer
,
and
once
more
retrace
my
step
.
<EOS>
He
still
wait
;
he
hold
a
key
in
his
hand
:
approach
one
of
the
small
,
black
door
<EOS>
,
he
put
it
in
the
lock
;
he
pause
,
and
address
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
turn
sick
at
the
sight
of
blood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
not
:
I
have
never
be
try
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
a
thrill
while
I
answer
him
;
but
no
coldness
,
and
no
faintness
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
give
me
your
hand
,
"
he
say
:
"
it
will
not
do
to
risk
a
fainting
fit
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
finger
into
his
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
warm
and
steady
,
"
be
his
remark
:
he
turn
the
key
and
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
a
room
I
remember
to
have
see
before
,
the
day
Mrs.
Fairfax
show
me
over
the
house
:
it
be
hang
with
tapestry
;
but
the
tapestry
be
now
loop
up
in
one
part
,
and
there
be
a
door
apparent
,
which
have
then
be
conceal
.
<EOS>
this
door
be
open
;
a
light
shine
out
of
the
room
within
<EOS>
:
I
hear
thence
a
snarling
,
snatch
sound
,
almost
like
a
dog
quarrelling
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
put
down
his
candle
,
say
to
me
,
"
wait
a
minute
,
"
and
he
go
forward
to
the
inner
apartment
.
<EOS>
a
shout
of
laughter
greet
his
entrance
;
noisy
at
first
,
and
terminate
in
Grace
Poole
's
own
goblin
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
then
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
make
some
sort
of
arrangement
without
speak
,
though
I
hear
a
low
voice
address
him
:
he
come
out
and
close
the
door
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
and
I
walk
round
to
the
other
side
of
a
large
bed
,
which
with
its
draw
curtain
conceal
a
considerable
portion
of
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
an
easy
-
chair
be
near
the
bed
-
head
:
a
man
sit
in
it
,
dress
with
the
exception
of
his
coat
;
he
be
still
;
his
head
leant
back
;
his
eye
be
close
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
hold
the
candle
over
him
;
I
recognise
in
his
pale
and
seemingly
lifeless
<EOS>
face
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
,
Mason
<EOS>
:
I
see
too
that
his
linen
on
one
side
,
and
one
arm
,
be
almost
soak
in
blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
hold
the
candle
,
"
say
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
<EOS>
I
take
it
:
he
fetch
a
basin
of
water
from
the
washstand
:
"
hold
that
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
I
obey
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
sponge
,
dip
it
in
,
and
moisten
the
corpse
-
like
face
;
he
ask
for
my
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
apply
it
to
the
nostril
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mason
shortly
unclose
his
eye
;
he
groan
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
open
the
shirt
of
the
wounded
man
,
whose
arm
and
shoulder
be
bandage
:
he
sponge
away
blood
,
trickle
fast
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
immediate
danger
?
"
murmur
Mr.
Mason
.
  
<EOS>
"
pooh
!
<EOS>
no
 
a
mere
scratch
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
so
overcome
,
man
<EOS>
:
bear
up
!
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
a
surgeon
for
you
now
,
myself
:
you
will
be
able
to
be
remove
by
morning
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Jane
,
"
he
continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
leave
you
in
this
room
with
this
gentleman
,
for
an
hour
,
or
perhaps
two
hour
:
you
will
sponge
the
blood
as
I
do
when
it
return
:
if
he
feel
faint
,
you
will
put
the
glass
of
water
on
that
stand
to
his
lip
,
and
your
salt
to
his
nose
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
speak
to
him
on
any
pretext
 
and
 
Richard
,
it
will
be
at
the
peril
of
your
life
if
you
speak
to
her
:
open
your
lip
 
<EOS>
agitate
yourself
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
not
answer
for
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
the
poor
man
groan
;
he
look
as
if
he
dare
not
move
;
fear
,
either
of
death
or
of
something
else
,
appear
almost
to
paralyse
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
put
the
now
bloody
sponge
into
my
hand
,
and
I
proceed
to
use
it
as
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
watch
me
a
second
,
then
say
,
"
remember
!
 
<EOS>
no
conversation
,
"
he
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
experience
a
strange
feeling
as
the
key
grate
in
the
lock
,
and
the
sound
of
his
retreat
step
cease
to
be
hear
.
  
<EOS>
here
then
I
be
in
the
third
storey
,
fasten
into
one
of
its
mystic
cell
;
night
around
me
;
a
pale
and
bloody
spectacle
under
my
eye
and
hand
;
a
murderess
hardly
separate
from
me
by
a
single
door
:
yes
 
that
be
appalling
 
the
rest
I
could
bear
;
but
I
shudder
at
the
thought
of
Grace
Poole
burst
out
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
keep
to
my
post
,
however
.
<EOS>
I
must
watch
this
ghastly
countenance
 
<EOS>
these
blue
,
still
lip
forbid
to
unclose
 
these
eye
now
shut
,
now
open
,
now
wander
through
the
room
,
now
fix
on
me
,
and
ever
glaze
with
the
dulness
of
horror
.
<EOS>
I
must
dip
my
hand
again
and
again
in
the
basin
of
blood
and
water
,
and
wipe
away
the
trickle
gore
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
the
light
of
the
unsnuffed
candle
wane
on
my
employment
;
the
shadow
darken
on
the
wrought
,
antique
tapestry
round
me
,
and
grow
black
under
the
hanging
of
the
vast
old
bed
,
and
quiver
strangely
over
the
door
of
a
great
cabinet
opposite
 
whose
front
,
divide
into
twelve
panel
,
bore
,
in
grim
design
,
the
head
of
the
twelve
apostle
,
each
enclose
in
its
separate
panel
as
in
a
frame
;
while
above
them
at
the
top
rise
an
ebon
crucifix
and
a
die
Christ
.
  
<EOS>
accord
as
the
shifting
obscurity
and
flicker
gleam
hover
here
or
glance
there
,
it
be
now
the
bearded
physician
,
Luke
,
that
bend
his
brow
;
now
St.
John
's
long
hair
that
wave
;
and
anon
the
devilish
face
of
Judas
,
that
grow
out
of
the
panel
,
and
seem
gather
life
and
threaten
a
revelation
of
the
arch
-
traitor
 
of
Satan
himself
 
in
his
subordinate
's
form
.
  
<EOS>
amidst
all
this
,
I
have
to
listen
as
well
as
watch
:
to
listen
for
the
movement
of
the
wild
beast
or
the
fiend
in
yonder
side
den
.
<EOS>
but
since
Mr.
Rochester
's
visit
it
seem
spellbound
:
all
the
night
I
hear
but
three
sound
at
three
long
interval
,
 
a
step
creak
,
a
momentary
renewal
of
the
snarling
,
canine
noise
,
and
a
deep
human
groan
.
  
<EOS>
then
my
own
thought
worry
me
.
<EOS>
what
crime
be
this
that
live
incarnate
in
this
sequestered
mansion
,
and
could
neither
be
expel
nor
subdue
by
the
owner
?
 
<EOS>
what
mystery
,
that
break
out
now
in
fire
and
now
in
blood
,
at
the
dead
hour
of
night
?
<EOS>
what
creature
be
it
,
that
,
mask
in
an
ordinary
woman
's
face
and
shape
,
utter
the
voice
,
now
of
a
mock
demon
,
and
anon
of
a
carrion
-
seek
bird
of
prey
?
  
<EOS>
and
this
man
I
bend
over
 
this
commonplace
,
quiet
stranger
 
<EOS>
how
have
he
become
involved
in
the
web
of
horror
?
<EOS>
and
why
have
the
Fury
fly
at
him
?
<EOS>
what
make
him
seek
this
quarter
of
the
house
at
an
untimely
season
,
when
he
should
have
be
asleep
in
bed
?
<EOS>
I
have
hear
Mr.
Rochester
assign
him
an
apartment
below
 
<EOS>
what
bring
him
here
!
<EOS>
and
why
,
now
,
be
he
so
tame
under
the
violence
or
treachery
<EOS>
do
him
?
<EOS>
why
do
he
so
quietly
submit
to
the
concealment
Mr.
Rochester
enforce
?
<EOS>
why
_
do
_
Mr.
Rochester
enforce
this
concealment
?
<EOS>
His
guest
have
be
outrage
,
his
own
life
on
a
former
occasion
have
be
hideously
plot
against
;
and
both
attempt
he
smother
in
secrecy
and
sink
in
oblivion
!
<EOS>
lastly
,
I
see
Mr.
Mason
be
submissive
to
Mr.
Rochester
;
that
the
impetuous
will
of
the
latter
hold
complete
sway
over
the
inertness
of
the
former
:
the
few
word
which
have
pass
between
them
assure
me
of
this
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
in
their
former
intercourse
,
the
passive
disposition
of
the
one
have
be
habitually
influence
by
the
active
energy
of
the
other
:
whence
then
have
arise
Mr.
Rochester
's
dismay
when
he
hear
of
Mr.
Mason
's
arrival
?
<EOS>
why
have
the
mere
name
of
this
unresisting
individual
 
<EOS>
whom
his
word
now
suffice
to
control
like
a
child
 
<EOS>
fall
on
him
,
a
few
hour
since
,
as
a
thunderbolt
may
fall
on
an
oak
?
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
his
look
and
his
paleness
when
he
whisper
:
"
Jane
,
I
have
get
a
blow
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
blow
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
forget
how
the
arm
have
tremble
which
he
rest
on
my
shoulder
:
and
it
be
no
light
matter
which
could
thus
bow
the
resolute
spirit
and
thrill
the
vigorous
frame
of
Fairfax
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
will
he
come
?
<EOS>
when
will
he
come
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
inwardly
,
as
the
night
linger
and
linger
 
as
my
bleeding
patient
droop
,
moan
,
sicken
:
and
neither
day
nor
aid
arrive
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
again
and
again
,
hold
the
water
to
Mason
's
white
lip
;
again
and
again
offer
him
the
stimulate
salt
:
my
effort
seem
ineffectual
:
either
bodily
or
mental
suffering
,
or
loss
of
blood
,
or
all
three
combine
,
be
fast
prostrate
his
strength
.
<EOS>
He
moan
so
,
and
look
so
weak
,
wild
,
and
lose
,
I
fear
he
be
die
;
and
I
may
not
even
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
candle
,
waste
at
last
,
go
out
;
as
it
expire
,
I
perceive
streak
of
grey
light
edge
the
window
curtain
:
dawn
be
then
approach
.
<EOS>
presently
I
hear
Pilot
bark
far
below
,
out
of
his
distant
kennel
in
the
courtyard
:
hope
revive
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
unwarranted
:
in
five
minute
more
the
grating
key
,
the
yield
lock
,
warn
me
my
watch
be
relieve
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
have
last
more
than
two
hour
:
many
a
week
have
seem
short
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
enter
,
and
with
him
the
surgeon
he
have
be
to
fetch
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Carter
,
be
on
the
alert
,
"
he
say
to
this
last
:
"
I
give
you
but
half
-
an
-
hour
for
dress
the
wound
,
fasten
the
bandage
,
get
the
patient
downstairs
and
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
he
fit
to
move
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
of
it
;
it
be
nothing
serious
;
he
be
nervous
,
his
spirit
must
be
keep
up
.
<EOS>
come
,
set
to
work
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
draw
back
the
thick
curtain
,
draw
up
the
holland
blind
,
let
in
all
the
daylight
he
could
;
and
I
be
surprised
and
cheer
to
see
how
far
dawn
be
advance
:
what
rosy
streak
be
begin
to
brighten
the
east
.
<EOS>
then
he
approach
Mason
,
whom
the
surgeon
be
already
handle
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
my
good
fellow
,
how
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
do
for
me
,
I
fear
,
"
be
the
faint
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
whit
!
 
<EOS>
courage
!
<EOS>
this
day
fortnight
you
will
hardly
be
a
pin
the
bad
of
it
:
you
have
lose
a
little
blood
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
Carter
,
assure
him
there
be
no
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
that
conscientiously
,
"
say
Carter
,
who
have
now
undo
the
bandage
;
"
only
I
wish
I
could
have
get
here
sooner
<EOS>
:
he
would
not
have
bleed
so
much
 
<EOS>
but
how
be
this
?
<EOS>
the
flesh
on
the
shoulder
be
tear
as
well
as
cut
.
<EOS>
this
wound
be
not
do
with
a
knife
:
there
have
be
tooth
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
bite
me
,
"
he
murmur
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
worry
me
like
a
tigress
,
when
Rochester
get
the
knife
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
yield
:
you
should
have
grapple
with
her
at
once
,
"
say
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
under
such
circumstance
,
what
could
one
do
?
"
return
Mason
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
frightful
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
shudder
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
expect
it
:
she
look
so
quiet
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
warn
you
,
"
be
his
friend
's
answer
;
"
I
say
 
be
on
your
guard
when
you
go
near
her
.
<EOS>
besides
,
you
may
have
wait
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
have
me
with
you
:
it
be
mere
folly
to
attempt
the
interview
to
-
night
,
and
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
have
do
some
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
!
<EOS>
you
think
!
<EOS>
yes
,
it
make
me
impatient
to
hear
you
:
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
you
have
suffer
,
and
be
likely
to
suffer
enough
for
not
take
my
advice
;
so
I
will
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
Carter
 
hurry
!
 
<EOS>
hurry
!
<EOS>
the
sun
will
soon
rise
,
and
I
must
have
him
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
directly
,
sir
;
the
shoulder
be
just
bandage
.
<EOS>
I
must
look
to
this
other
wound
in
the
arm
:
she
have
have
her
tooth
here
too
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
suck
the
blood
:
she
say
she
would
drain
my
heart
,
"
say
Mason
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
shudder
:
a
singularly
mark
expression
of
disgust
,
horror
,
hatred
,
warp
his
countenance
almost
to
distortion
;
but
he
only
say
    
"
come
,
be
silent
,
Richard

never
mind
her
gibberish
:
do
not
repeat
it

"
  
<EOS>

I
wish
I
could
forget
it

the
answer

<EOS>
"
You
will
when
you
be
out

you
get
back
to
Spanish
Town

two
hour

It
be
by
this
time
half
-
past
five
,
and
the
sun
be
on
the
point
of

;
but
I
find
the
kitchen
still
dark
and
silent
.
<EOS>
the
side

passage
door
be
fasten

I
open
it
with
as
little
noise
as
possible

all

the

stand
wide
open

there
be
a

chaise

with
horse
ready
harness

station
outside

<EOS>
I
approach
him

say
the

he
nod
:
then
I
look
carefully
round
and
listen

<EOS>
the
stillness
of
early
morning
slumber
everywhere
;
the
curtain

little

blossom

blanch
orchard

whose
bough
droop
like
white
garland
over
the

stamp
from

the

Carter

<EOS>
"
take
care

say
Mr.

to
the
latter

"
and
keep
him
at

shut
up

drive
away

<EOS>
"
yet
would
to
God

add
Mr.

as
he
close
and
bar
the
heavy
yard

gate

<EOS>
this
done
,
he
move
with
slow
step
and
abstract
air
towards
a
door
in
the

border
the
orchard

<EOS>
I
,
suppose
he
have
do
with

prepare

return

again

however

I
hear
him
call

He
have
open
the
portal

stand
at
it

wait
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
where
there
be
some
freshness
,
for
a
few
moment

he
say
;
"
that
house
be
a
mere
dungeon
:
do
not
you
feel
it
so
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
a
splendid
mansion

<EOS>
"
the
glamour
of
inexperience
be
over
your
eye

he
answer
;
"
and
you
see
it
through
a
charm
medium
:
you
can
not
discern
that
the
gilding
be
slime
and
the
silk
drapery
cobwebs
;
that
the
marble
be
sordid
slate
,
and
the
polished
wood
mere
refuse
chip
and
scaly
bark

(
he

enclosure

have
enter

He
stray
down
a

with
apple

cherry
tree

They

fresh
now
as
a
succession
of
April
shower

gleam

follow
by
a
lovely

make
them

the
sun
be
just

the

east

and
his
light
illumine
the
wreathed

dewy
orchard

down

under
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane

will
you

<EOS>
He
gather
a
half

blow
rose

the

offer
it

I

out

but
I
have
fasten
the
door

have
the
key
in

should
have
be
a
careless
shepherd
if
I
have
leave
a
lamb
 
my
pet
lamb
 
so
near
a
wolf

den

unguarded

Will

I
can
not
vouch
for
that
till
Mason
be
out
of
England
:
nor
even
then
.
<EOS>
to
live
,
for
me
,
Jane

be
to
stand
on
a
crater

crust
which
may
crack

spue
fire
any

Mr.

easily

Your

tell

the
danger

<EOS>
He
laugh
sardonically

hastily
take
my

as
hastily
throw
it
from
him

annihilate

<EOS>
ever

to
him

do

the

do

I

I

keep

now
you
look
puzzle

puzzle

further

precisely

I

you

My

would

"
no

now

I
will
put
a

suppose

first

look
at

tell
me
you
be
at
ease

no

well
then
,
Jane
,
call
to
aid
your
fancy
:
 
suppose
you
be
no
longer
a
girl
well
rear
and
discipline
,
but
<EOS>
a
wild
boy
indulge
from
childhood
upward
;
imagine
yourself
in
a
remote
foreign
land
;
conceive
that
you
there
commit
a
capital
error
,
<EOS>
no
matter
of
what
nature
or
from
what
motive
,
but
one
whose
consequence
must
follow
you
through
life
and
taint
all
your
existence

<EOS>
mind
,
I
do
not
say
a
_
crime
_
;
I
be
not
speak
of
shedding
of
blood
or
any
other
guilty
act
,
which
may
make

perpetrator
amenable
to

my

be
_
error

<EOS>
the
result
of
what
you
have

become
in

to
you
utterly
insupportable
;
you
take
measure
to
obtain
relief
:
unusual
measure
,
but
neither
unlawful
nor
culpable
.
<EOS>
still
you
be
miserable
;
for
hope
have
quit
you
on
the
very
confine
of
life
:
your
sun
at
noon
darken
in
an
eclipse

it

bitter
and
base
association

become
the

wander
here

there

seek
rest
in
exile
:
happiness
in
pleasure
 
<EOS>
I
mean
in
heartless
,
sensual
pleasure
 
such
as
dull
intellect

blight
feel

<EOS>
heart
-
weary

soul
-
wither
<EOS>
,
you
come
home
after
year
of
voluntary
banishment
:
you
make
a
new
acquaintance
 
<EOS>
how
or
where
no
matter
:
you
find
in
this
stranger
much
of
the
good

bright
quality
which
you
have
seek
for
twenty
year

and
never

they
be

fresh

healthy

without

without

<EOS>
such
society
revive

regenerate

feel
well
day
come
back
 
high
wish

purer
feeling

you
desire
to
recommence
your
life

spend
what
remain

you
of
day
in
a
way
more
worthy
of
an
immortal
being

<EOS>
to
attain
this
end
,
be
you
justified
in
overleap
an
obstacle
of
custom
 
a
mere
conventional
impediment
which
neither

sanctify

your
judgment
approve

<EOS>
He
pause
for
an
answer
:
and
what
be
I
to
say
?
<EOS>
oh
,
for
some
good
spirit
to
suggest
a
judicious
and
satisfactory
response
!
<EOS>
vain
aspiration
!
<EOS>
the
west
wind
whisper
in
the
ivy
round
me
;
but
no
gentle
Ariel
borrow
its
breath
as
a
medium
of
speech
:
the
bird
sing
in
the
tree
-
top
;
but
their
song
,
however
sweet
,
be
inarticulate
.
  
<EOS>
again
Mr.
Rochester
propound
his
query
:
  
"
<EOS>
be
the
wandering
and
sinful
,
but
now
rest
-
seek
and
repentant
,
man
justify
in
dare
the
world
's
opinion
,
in
order
to
attach
to
him
for
ever
this
gentle

gracious
,
genial
stranger
,
thereby
secure
his
own
peace
of
mind
and
regeneration
of
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
I
answer
,
"
a
wanderer
's
repose

a

reformation
should
never
depend
on
a
fellow

creature
.
<EOS>
man
and
woman
die
;
philosopher
falter
in
wisdom
,
and
Christians
in
goodness
:
if
any
one
you
know
have
suffer
and
err
,
let
him
look
high
than
his
equal
for
strength
to
amend
and
solace
to
heal
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
the
instrument
 
the
instrument
!
<EOS>
God
,
who
do
the
work
,
ordain
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
 
<EOS>
I
tell
it
you
without
parable
 
be
a
worldly
,
dissipate
,
restless
man
;
and
I
believe
I
have
find
the
instrument
for
my
cure
in

<EOS>
He
pause
:
the
bird
go
on
carolling
,
the
leave
lightly
rustle
.
<EOS>
I
almost
wonder
they
do
not
check
their
song
and
whisper
to
catch
the
suspend
revelation
;
but
they
would
have
have
to
wait
many
minute
 
<EOS>
so
long
be
the
silence

all

become
harsh
and
sarcastic
 
<EOS>
"
you

Ingram

Will

him
in

yard

cheerfully
    
"

<EOS>
presentiment
be
strange
thing
!
<EOS>
and
so
be
sympathy
;
and
so
be
sign
;
and
<EOS>
the
three
combine
make
one
mystery
to
which
humanity
have
not
yet
find
the
key
.
<EOS>
I
never
laugh
at
presentiment
in
my
life
,
because
I
have
have
strange
one
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
sympathy
,
I
believe
,
exist
(
for
instance
,
between
far
-
distant
,
long
-
absent
,
wholly
estranged
relative
assert
,
notwithstanding
their
alienation
,
the
unity
of
the
source
to
which
each
trace
his
origin
)
whose
working
baffle
mortal
comprehension
.
<EOS>
and
sign
,
for
aught
we
know
,
may
be
<EOS>
but
the
sympathy
of
nature
with
man
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
a
little
girl
,
only
six
year
old
,
I
one
night
hear
Bessie
Leaven
say
to
Martha
Abbot
that
she
have
be
dream
about
a
little
child
;
and
that
to
dream
of
child
be
a
sure
sign
of
trouble
,
either
to
one
's
self
or
one
's
kin
.
<EOS>
the
saying
may
have
wear
out
of
my
memory
,
have
not
a
circumstance
immediately
follow
which
serve
indelibly
to
fix
it
there
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
Bessie
be
send
for
home
to
the
deathbed
of
her
little
sister
.
  
<EOS>
of
late
I
have
often
recall
this
saying
and
this
incident
;
for
during
the
past
week
scarcely
a
night
have
go
over
my
couch
that
have
not
bring
with
it
a
dream
of
an
infant
,
which
I
sometimes
hush
in
my
arm
,
sometimes
dandle
on
my
knee
,
sometimes
watch
play
with
daisy
on
a
lawn
,
or
again
,
dabble
its
hand
in
running
water
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wail
child
this
night
,
and
a
laugh
one
<EOS>
the
next
:
now
it
nestle
close
to
me
,
and
now
it
run
from
me
;
but
whatever
mood
the
apparition
evince
,
whatever
aspect
it
wear
,
it
fail
not
for
seven
successive
night
to
meet
me
the
moment
I
enter
the
land
of
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
this
iteration
of
one
idea
 
this
strange
recurrence
of
one
image
,
and
I
grow
nervous
as
bedtime
approach
and
the
hour
of
the
vision
draw
near
.
<EOS>
It
be
from
companionship
with
this
baby
-
phantom
<EOS>
I
have
be
rouse
on
that
moonlight
night
when
I
hear
the
cry
;
and
it
be
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
<EOS>
follow
I
be
summon
downstairs
by
a
message
that
some
one
want
me
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.
<EOS>
on
repair
thither
,
I
find
a
man
wait
for
me
,
have
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
's
servant
:
he
be
dressed
in
deep
mourning
,
and
the
hat
he
hold
in
his
hand
be
surround
with
a
crape
band
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
you
hardly
remember
me
,
Miss
,
"
he
say
,
rise
as
I
enter
;
"
but
<EOS>
my
name
be
Leaven

:
I
live
coachman
with
Mrs.
Reed
when
you
be

Gateshead
,
eight

nine
year
since

and
I
live
there
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>

do
you
do

<EOS>
I
remember
you
very
well
:

me
a
ride
sometimes
on
Miss
Georgiana
's
bay
pony

<EOS>
and
how

<EOS>

Robert

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
I
can
not
give
you
well
news
of
them
,
Miss
<EOS>
:
they
be
very
badly
at
present
 
in
great
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
no
one
be
dead
,
"
I
say
,
glance
at
his
black
dress
.
<EOS>
He
too
look
down
at
the
crape
round
his
hat
and
reply
    
"
Mr.
John
die
yesterday
be
a
week
,
at
his
chamber
in
London

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
his
mother
bear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
Miss
Eyre
,
it
be
not
a
common
mishap
:
<EOS>
his
life
have
be
very
wild
:
these
last
three
year
he
give
himself
up
to
strange
way
,
and
his
death
be
shocking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
from
Bessie
<EOS>
he
be
not
do
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
well
!
<EOS>
He
could
not
do
bad
:
he
ruin
his
health
and
his
estate
amongst
the
bad
man
and
the
bad
woman
.
<EOS>
He
get
into
debt
and
into
jail
:
his
mother
help
him
out
twice
,
but
as
soon
as
he
be
free
he
return
to
his
old
companion
and
habit
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
not
strong
:
the
knave
he
live
amongst
fool
him
beyond
anything
I
ever
hear
.
<EOS>
He
come
down
to
Gateshead
about
three
week
ago
and
want
missis
to
give
up
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
missis
refuse
:
her
mean
have
long
be
much
reduce
by
his
extravagance
;
so
he
go
back
again
,
and
the
next
news
be
that
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
how
he
die
,
God
know
!
 
<EOS>
they
say
he
kill
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
silent
:
the
thing
be
frightful
.
<EOS>
Robert
Leaven
resume
    
"
Missis
have
be
out
of
health
herself
for
some
time
:
she
have
get
very
stout
,
but
be
not
strong
with
it
;
and
the
loss
of
money
and
fear
of
poverty
be
quite
break
her
down
.
<EOS>
the
information
about
Mr.
John
's
death
and
the
manner
of
it
come
too
suddenly
:
it
bring
on
a
stroke
.
<EOS>
She
be
three
day
without
speak
;
but
last
Tuesday
she
seem
rather
better
<EOS>
:
she
appear
as
if
she
want
to
say
something
,
and
keep
make
sign
to
my
wife
and
mumbling
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
yesterday
morning
,
however
,
that
Bessie
understand
she
be
pronounce
your
name
;
and
at
last
she
make
out
the
word
,
"
bring
Jane
 
fetch
<EOS>
Jane
Eyre
<EOS>
:
I
want

"
<EOS>
Bessie
be
not
sure
whether
she
be
in
her
right
mind
,
or
mean
anything
by
the
word
;
but
she
tell
Miss
Reed
and
Miss
Georgiana
,
and
advise
them
to
send
for
you
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
put
it
off
at
first
;
but
their
mother
grow
so
restless
,
and
say
,
"
Jane
,
Jane

"
so
many
time
,
that
at
last
they
consent
.
<EOS>
I
leave
Gateshead
yesterday
:
and
if
you
can
get
ready
,
Miss

I
should
like
to
take
you
back

early
to
-
morrow
morning

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

Robert

I
shall
be
ready

it
seem
to
me
that
I
ought
to
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
,
<EOS>
Mississippi
Bessie
say
she
be
sure
you
would
not
refuse
:
but
I
suppose
you
will
have
to
ask
leave
before
you
can
get
off
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
I
will
do
it
now
;
"
and
have
direct
him
to
the
servant
'
hall
,
and
recommend
him
to
the
care
of
John
's
wife
,
and
the
attention
of
John
himself
,
I
go
in
search
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
any
of
the
low
room
;
he
be
not
in
the
yard
,
the
stable
,
or
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
ask
Mrs.
Fairfax
if
she
have
see
him
;
 
<EOS>
yes
:
she
believe
he
be
play
billiard
with
Miss
Ingram
.
<EOS>
to
the
billiard-
room
I
hasten
:
the
click
of
ball
and
the
hum
of
voice
resound
thence
;
Mr.
Rochester
,
Miss
Ingram
,
the
two
Misses
Eshton
,
and
their
admirer
,
be
all
busied
in
the
game
.
<EOS>
It
require
some
courage
to
disturb
so
interesting
a
party
;
my
errand
,
however
,
be
one
I
could
not
defer
,
so
I
approach
the
master
where
he
stand
at
Miss
Ingram
's
side
.
<EOS>
She
turn
as
I
draw
near
,
and
look
at
me
haughtily
:
<EOS>
her
eye
seem
to
demand
,
"
what
can
the
creep
creature
want
now
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
say
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
Mr.
Rochester

"
she
make
a
movement
as
if
tempt
to
order
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
appearance
at
the
moment
 
<EOS>
it
be
very
graceful
and
very
striking
:
she
wear
a
morning
robe
of
sky
-
blue
crape
;
a
gauzy
azure
scarf
be
twist
in
her
hair
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
all
animation
with
the
game
,
and
irritated
pride
do
not
lower
the
expression
of
her
haughty
lineament
.
  
<EOS>
"

that
person
want
you

"
<EOS>
she
inquire
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
turn
to
see
who
the
"
person
"
be
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
curious
grimace
 
one
of
his
strange
and
equivocal
demonstration
 
throw
down
his
cue
and
follow

from
the

I
draw
out
my

five
shilling

"
<EOS>
He
take
the
purse
,
pour
the
hoard
into
his
palm
,
and
chuckle
over
it
as
if
its
scantiness
amuse

soon

something

right

better

stay
away
three
month

Mr.

You

as

what
then

"
  
<EOS>
"
in

Adele

out

otherwise
walk
over

emphatically

<EOS>
there
be
sense
in
the
suggestion

not
a
doubt
of
it

<EOS>
Adele
,
as
you
say
,
must
go
to
school

you

march
straight

I

with

fantastic

ludicrous

no

good

I
suppose
so

up

it

that
all

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
"
It
seem
stingy

to
my
notion

dry
,

unfriendly
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
something
else
:
a
little
addition
to
the
rite

<EOS>
if
one
shake
hand

for
instance

no

you

It

enough

will
may
be
convey

hearty

very

cool

Farewell

how
long
be
he
go
to
stand
with
his
back

I
want

commence
my
packing

<EOS>
the
dinner
-
bell
rang
,
and
suddenly
away
he
bolt
,
without
another
syllable
<EOS>
:
I
see
him
no
more
during
the
day
,
and
be
off
before
he
have
rise
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
reach
the
lodge
at
Gateshead
about
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
first
of
May
:
I
step
in
there
before
go
up
to
the
hall

It
be
very
clean
and
neat
:
the
ornamental
window
be
hang
with
little
white
curtain
;
the
floor
be
spotless
;
the
grate
and
fire
-
iron

burnish
bright

fire
burn
clear

sit
on
the
hearth

nurse
her
last

bear

Robert

sister
play
quietly
in

corner

bless

I
know
you
would
come

exclaim
Mrs.
Leaven

<EOS>
"
yes

Bessie

say
I
,
after
I
have
kiss
her
;

I
trust
I
be
not

late

how
be
Mrs.

alive

still

<EOS>
"
yes

alive

the
doctor
say

may
linger
a
week

two

hardly

finally
recover

She
generally
lie
in
a
kind
of
lethargy
all
the
afternoon

and
wake
up
about
six
or
seven
.
<EOS>
Will
you
rest
yourself
here
an
hour
,
Miss

then
I

go
up
with
you

<EOS>
Robert
here
enter
,
and
Bessie
lay
her
sleep
child
in
the
cradle
and
go
to
welcome
him
:
<EOS>
afterwards
she
insist
on
my
taking
off
my
bonnet
and
have
some
tea
;
for
she
say
I
look
pale
and
tired
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
accept
her
hospitality
;
and
I
submit
to
be
relieve
of
my
travel
garb
just
as
passively
as
I
use
to
let
her
undress
me
when
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
old
time
crowd
fast
back
on
me
as
I
watch
her
bustling
about
 
set
out
the
tea
-
tray
with
her
good
china
,
cut
bread
and
butter
,
toast
a
tea
-
cake
,
and
,
between
while
,
give
little
Robert
or
Jane
an
occasional
tap
or
push
,
just
as
she
use
to
give
me
in
former
day
.
<EOS>
Bessie
have
retain
her
quick
temper
as
well
as
her
light
foot
and
good
look
.
  
<EOS>
tea
ready
,
I
be
go
to
approach
the
table
;
but
she
desire
me
to
sit
still
,
quite
in
her
old
peremptory
tone
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
serve
at
the
fireside
,
she
say
;
and
she
place
before
me
a
little
round
stand
with
my
cup
and
a
plate
of
toast
,
absolutely
as
she
use
to
accommodate
me
with
some
privately
purloin
dainty
on
a
nursery
chair
:
and
I
smile
and
obey
her
as
in
bygone
day
.
  
<EOS>
She
want
to
know
if
I
be
happy
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
and
what
sort
of
a
person
the
mistress
be
;
and
when
I
tell
her
there
be
only
a
master
,
whether
he
be
a
nice
gentleman
,
and
if
I
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
he
be
rather
an
ugly
man
,
but
quite
a
gentleman
;
and
that
he
treat
me
kindly
,
and
I
be
content
.
<EOS>
then
I
go
on
to
describe
to
her
the
gay
company
that
have
lately
be
stay
at
the
house
;
and
to
these
detail
Bessie
listen
with
interest
:
they
be
precisely
of
the
kind
she
relish
.
  
<EOS>
in
such
conversation
an
hour
be
soon
go
:
Bessie
restore
to
me
my
bonnet
,
&
c.
,
and
,
accompany
by
her
,
<EOS>
I
quit
the
lodge
for
the
hall
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
accompany
by
her
that
I
have
,
nearly
nine
year
ago
,
walk
down
the
path
I
be
now
ascend
.
<EOS>
on
a
dark
,
misty
,
raw
morning
in
January
,
I
have
leave
a
hostile
roof
with
a
desperate
and
embittered
heart
 
a
sense
of
outlawry
and
almost
of
reprobation
 
to
seek
the
chilly
harbourage
of
Lowood
:
that
bourne
so
far
away
and
unexplored
.
<EOS>
the
same
hostile
roof
now
again
rise
before
me
:
<EOS>
my
prospect
be
doubtful
yet
;
and
I
have
yet
an
ache
heart
.
<EOS>
I
still
feel
as
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
;
but
I
experience
firm
trust
in
myself
and
my
own
power
,
and
less
wither
dread
of
oppression
.
<EOS>
the
gape
wound
of
my
wrong
,
too
,
be
now
quite
heal
;
and
the
flame
of
resentment
extinguish
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
go
into
the
breakfast
-
room
first
,
"
say
Bessie
,
as
she
precede
me
through
the
hall
;
"
the
young
lady
will
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
another
moment
I
be
within
that
apartment
.
<EOS>
there
be
every
article
of
furniture
look
just
as
it
do
on
the
morning
I
be
first
introduce
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
:
the
very
rug
he
have
stand
upon
still
cover
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
glance
at
the
bookcase
,
I
think
I
could
distinguish
the
two
volume
of
Bewick
's
british
Birds
occupy
their
old
place
on
the
third
shelf
,
and
Gulliver
's
travel
and
the
Arabian
Nights
range
just
above
.
<EOS>
the
inanimate
object
be
not
change
;
but
the
live
thing
have
alter
past
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
two
young
lady
appear
before
me
;
one
very
tall
,
almost
as
tall
as
Miss
Ingram
 
very
thin
too
,
with
a
sallow
face
and
severe
mien
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
ascetic
in
her
look
,
which
be
augment
by
the
extreme
plainness
of
a
straight
-
skirt
,
black
,
stuff
dress
,
a
starched
linen
collar
,
hair
comb
away
from
the
temple
,
and
the
nun
-
like
ornament
of
a
string
of
ebony
bead
and
a
crucifix
.
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
<EOS>
be
Eliza
,
though
I
could
trace
little
resemblance
to
her
former
self
in
that
elongated
and
colourless
visage
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
be
as
certainly
Georgiana
:
but
not
the
Georgiana
<EOS>
I
remember
 
the
slim
and
fairy
-
like
girl
of
eleven
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
full
-
blown
,
very
plump
damsel
,
fair
as
waxwork
,
with
handsome
and
regular
feature
,
languish
blue
eye
,
and
ringlete
yellow
hair
.
<EOS>
the
hue
of
her
dress
be
black
too
;
but
its
fashion
be
so
different
from
her
sister
's
 
so
much
more
flowing
and
become
 
<EOS>
it
look
as
stylish
as
the
other
's
look
puritanical
.
  
<EOS>
in
each
of
the
sister
there

the

her

of

perhaps
a
little
softened

but
still
impart
an
indescribable
hardness
to
the
countenance
otherwise
so
voluptuous
and
buxom

<EOS>
both
lady
,
as
I
advance
,
rise
to
welcome
me
,
and
both
address
me
by
the
name
of
"
Miss
Eyre
.
<EOS>
"
Eliza
's
greeting
be
deliver
in
a
short
,
abrupt
voice
,
without
a
smile
;
and
then
she
sit
down
again
,
fix
her
eye
on
the
fire
,
and
seem
to
forget
me
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
add
to
her
"
how
d'ye
do
?
"
<EOS>
several
commonplace
about
my
journey
,
the
weather
,
and
so
on
,
uttered
in
rather
a
drawl
tone
:

the

of
my
drab

pelisse

and
now
linger
on
the
plain
trimming
of
my
cottage
bonnet
.
<EOS>
young
lady
have
a
remarkable
way
of
let
you
know
that
they
think
you
a
"
quiz
"
without
actually
say
the
word
.
<EOS>
a
certain
superciliousness
of
look
,
coolness
of
manner
,
nonchalance
of
tone
,
express
fully
their
sentiment
on
the
point
,
without
commit
them
by
any
positive
rudeness
in
word
or
deed
.
  
<EOS>
a
sneer
,
however
,
whether
covert
or
open
,
have
now
no
longer
that
power
over
me
it
once
possess
:
as
I
sit
between
my
cousin
,
I
be
surprised
to
find
how
easy
I
feel
under
the
total
neglect
of
the
one
and
the
semi-
sarcastic
attention
of
the
other
 
Eliza
do
not
mortify
,
nor
Georgiana
ruffle
me
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
have
other
thing
to
think
about
;
within
the
last
few
month
feeling
have
be
stir
in
me
so
much
more
potent
than
any
they
could
raise
 
pain
and
pleasure
so
much
more
acute
and
exquisite
have
be
excite
than
any
it
be
in
their
power
to
inflict
or
bestow
 
that
their
air
give
me
no
concern
either
for
good
or
bad
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
Mrs.
Reed
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
soon
,
look
calmly
at
Georgiana
,
who
think
fit
to
bridle
at
the
direct
address
,
as
if
it
be
an
unexpected
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Reed
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
mama
,
you
mean
;
she
be
extremely
poorly
:
I
doubt
if
you
can
see
her
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
would
just
step
upstairs
and
tell
her
I
be
come
,
I
should
be
much
oblige
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Georgiana
almost
start
,
and
she
open
her
blue
eye
wild
and
wide
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
have
a
particular
wish
to
see
me
,
"
I
add
,
"
and
I
would
not
defer
attend
to
her
desire
longer
than
be
absolutely
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mama
dislike
be
disturb
in
an
evening
,
"
remark
Eliza
.
<EOS>
I
soon
rise
,
quietly
take
off
my
bonnet
and
glove
,
uninvited
,
and
say
I
would
just
step
out
to
Bessie
 
<EOS>
who
be
,
I
dare
say
,
in
the
kitchen
 
and
ask
her
to
ascertain
whether
Mrs.
Reed
be
dispose
to
receive
me
or
not
to-
night
.
<EOS>
I
go
,
and
have
find
Bessie
and
despatch
her
on
my
errand
,
I
proceed
to
take
further
measure
.
<EOS>
It
have
heretofore
be
my
habit
always
to
shrink
from
arrogance
:
receive
as
I
have
be
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
I
should
,
a
year
ago
,
have
resolve
to
quit
Gateshead
the
very
next
morning
;
now
,
it
be
disclose
to
me
all
at
once
that
that
would
be
a
foolish
plan
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
a
journey
of
a
hundred
mile
to
see
my
aunt
,
and
I
must
stay
with
her
till
she
be
well
 
or
dead
<EOS>
:
as
to
her
daughter
'
pride
or
folly
,
I
must
put
it
on
one
side
,
make
myself
independent
of
it
.
<EOS>
so
I
address
the
housekeeper
;
ask
her
to
show
me
a
room
,
tell
her
I
should
probably
be
a
visitor
here
for
a
week
or
two
,
have
my
trunk
convey
to
my
chamber
,
and
follow
it
thither
myself
:
I
meet
Bessie
on
the
landing
.
  
<EOS>
"
missis
be
awake
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
have
tell
her
you
be
here
:
come
and
let
us
see
if
she
will
know
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
need
to
be
guide
to
the
well
-
know
room
,
to
which
I
have
so
often
be
summon
for
chastisement
or
reprimand
in
former
day
.
<EOS>
I
hasten
before
Bessie
;
I
softly
open
the
door
:
a
shaded
light
stand
on
the
table
,
for
it
be
now
get
dark
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
great
four
-
post
bed
with
amber
hanging
as
of
old
;
there
the
toilet
-
table
,
the
armchair
,
and
the
footstool
,
at
which
I
have
a
hundred
time
be
sentence
to
kneel
,
to
ask
pardon
for
offence
by
me
uncommitted
.
<EOS>
I
look
into
a
certain
corner
near
,
half
-
expecting
to
see
the
slim
outline
of
a
once
dread
switch
which
use
to
lurk
there
,
wait
to
leap
out
imp
-
like
and
lace
my
quivering
palm
or
shrink
neck
.
<EOS>
I
approach
the
bed
;
I
open
the
curtain
and
leant
over
the
high
-
pile
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
well
do
I
remember
Mrs.
Reed
's
face
,
and
I
eagerly
seek
the
familiar
image
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
happy
thing
that
time
quell
the
longing
of
vengeance
and
hush
the
prompting
of
rage
and
aversion
.
<EOS>
I
have
leave
this
woman
in
bitterness
and
hate
,
and
I
come
back
to
her
now
with
no
other
emotion
than
a
sort
of
ruth
for
her
great
suffering
,
and
a
strong
yearning
to
forget
and
forgive
all
injury
 
to
be
reconcile
and
clasp
hand
in
amity
.
  
<EOS>
the
well
-
know
face
be
there
:
stern
,
relentless
as
ever
 
<EOS>
there
be
that
peculiar
eye
which
nothing
could
melt
,
and
the
somewhat
raise
,
imperious
,
despotic
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
how
often
have
it
lower
on
me
menace
and
hate
!
<EOS>
and
how
the
recollection
of
childhood
's
terror
and
sorrow
revive
as
I
trace
its
harsh
line
now
!
<EOS>
and
yet
I
stoop
down
and
kiss
her
:
she
look
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
Jane
Eyre
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Aunt
Reed
.
<EOS>
how
be
you
,
dear
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
once
vow
that
I
would
never
call
her
aunt
again
:
I
think
it
no
sin
to
forget
and
break
that
vow
now
.
<EOS>
My
finger
have
fasten
on
her
hand
which
lie
outside
the
sheet
:
have
she
press
mine
kindly
,
I
should
at
that
moment
have
experience
true
pleasure
.
<EOS>
but
unimpressionable
nature
be
not
so
soon
soften
,
nor
be
natural
antipathy
so
readily
eradicate
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reed
take
her
hand
away
,
and
,
turn
her
face
rather
from
me
<EOS>
,
she
remark
that
the
night
be
warm
.
<EOS>
again
she
regard
me
so
icily
<EOS>
,
I
feel
at
once
that
her
opinion
of
me
 
her
feeling
towards
me
 
be
unchanged
and
unchangeable
.
<EOS>
I
know
by
her
stony
eye
 
opaque
to
tenderness
,
indissoluble
to
tear
 
that
she
be
resolve
to
consider
me
bad
to
the
last
;
because
to
believe
me
good
would
give
her
no
generous
pleasure
:
only
a
sense
of
mortification
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
pain
,
and
then
I
feel
ire
;
and
then
I
feel
a
determination
to
subdue
her
 
to
be
her
mistress
in
spite
both
of
her
nature
and
her
will
.
<EOS>
My
tear
have
rise
,
just
as
in
childhood
:
I
order
them
back
to
their
source
.
<EOS>
I
bring
a
chair
to
the
bed
-
head
:
I
sit
down
and
lean
over
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
send
for
me
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
I
be
here
;
and
it
be
my
intention
to
stay
till
I
see
how
you
get
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
of
course
!
<EOS>
You
have
see
my
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
may
tell
them
I
wish
you
to
stay
till
I
can
talk
some
thing
over
with
you
<EOS>
I
have
on
my
mind
:
to
-
night
<EOS>
it
be
too
late
,
and
I
have
a
difficulty
in
recall
them
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
I
wish
to
say
 
let
me
see
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
wander
look
and
change
utterance
tell
what
wreck
have
take
place
in
her
once
vigorous
frame
.
<EOS>
turn
restlessly
,
she
draw
the
bedclothe
round
her
;
my
elbow
,
rest
on
a
corner
of
the
quilt
,
fix
it
down
:
she
be
at
once
irritated
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
up
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
;
"
do
not
annoy
me
with
hold
the
clothe
fast
.
<EOS>
be
you
Jane
Eyre
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
Jane
Eyre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
more
trouble
with
that
child
than
any
one
would
believe
.
<EOS>
such
a
burden
to
be
leave
on
my
hand
 
and
so
much
annoyance
as
she
cause
me
,
daily
and
hourly
,
with
her
incomprehensible
disposition
,
and
her
sudden
start
of
temper
,
and
her
continual
,
unnatural
watching
of
one
's
movement
!
<EOS>
I
declare
she
talk
to
me
once
like
something
mad
,
or
like
a
fiend
 
no
child
ever
speak
or
look
as
she
do
;
I
be
glad
to
get
her
away
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
what
do
they
do
with
her
at
Lowood
?
<EOS>
the
fever
break
out
there
,
and
many
of
the
pupil
die
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
do
not
die
:
<EOS>
but
I
say
she
do
 
<EOS>
I
wish
she
have
die
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
strange
wish
,
Mrs.
Reed
;
why
do
you
hate
her
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
dislike
to
her
mother
always
;
for
she
be
my
husband
's
only
sister
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
him
:
he
oppose
the
family
's
disown
her
when
she
make
her
low
marriage
;
and
when
news
come
of
her
death
,
he
weep
like
a
simpleton
.
<EOS>
He
would
send
for
the
baby
;
though
I
entreat
him
rather
to
put
it
out
to
nurse
and
pay
for
its
maintenance
.
<EOS>
I
hate
it
the
first
time
I
set
my
eye
on
it
 
a
sickly
,
whining
,
pining
thing
!
<EOS>
It
would
wail
in
its
cradle
all
night
long
 
not
scream
heartily
like
any
other
child
,
but
whimpering
and
moan
.
<EOS>
Reed
pity
it
;
and
he
use
to
nurse
it
and
notice
it
as
if
it
have
be
his
own
:
more
,
indeed
,
than
he
ever
notice
his
own
at
that
age
.
<EOS>
He
would
try
to
make
my
child
friendly
to
the
little
beggar
:
the
darling
could
not
bear
it
,
and
he
be
angry
with
them
when
they
show
their
dislike
.
<EOS>
in
his
last
illness
,
he
have
it
bring
continually
to
his
bedside
;
and
but
an
hour
before
he
die
,
he
bind
me
by
vow
to
keep
the
creature
.
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
have
be
charge
with
a
pauper
brat
out
of
a
workhouse
:
but
he
be
weak
,
naturally
weak
.
<EOS>
John
do
not
at
all
resemble
his
father
,
and
I
be
glad
of
it
<EOS>
:
John
be
like
me
and
like
my
brother
 
he
be
quite
a
Gibson
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
wish
he
would
cease
torment
me
with
letter
for
money
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
money
to
give
him
:
we
be
get
poor
.
<EOS>
I
must
send
away
half
the
servant
and
shut
up
part
of
the
house
;
or
let
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
submit
to
do
that
 
yet
<EOS>
how
be
we
to
get
on
?
<EOS>
two
-
third
of
my
income
go
in
pay
the
interest
of
mortgage

<EOS>
John
gamble
dreadfully
,
and
always
lose
 
poor
boy
!
<EOS>
He
be
beset
by
sharper
:
John
be
sink
and
degrade
 
his
look
be
frightful
 
<EOS>
I
feel
ashamed
for
him
when
I
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
get
much
excited
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
better
leave
her
now
,
"
say
I
to
Bessie
,
who
stand
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
have
,
Miss
:
<EOS>
but
she
often
talk
in
this
way
towards
night
 
in
the
morning
<EOS>
she
be
calm

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rise
.
<EOS>
"
stop
!
"
exclaim
Mrs.
Reed
,
"
there
be
another
thing
I
wish
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
threaten
me
 
he
continually
threaten
me
with
his
own
death
,
or
mine
:
and
I
dream
sometimes
that
I
see
him
lay
out
with
a
great
wound
in
his
throat
,
or
with
a
swollen
and
blacken
face
.
<EOS>
I
be
come
to
a
strange
pass
:
I
have
heavy
trouble
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
<EOS>
how
be
the
money
to
be
have
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bessie
now
endeavour
to
persuade
her
to
take
a
sedative
draught
:
she
succeed
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
soon
after
,
Mrs.
Reed
grow
more
composed
,
and
sink
into
a
doze
state
.
<EOS>
I
then
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
ten
day
elapse
before
I
have
again
any
conversation
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
continue
either
delirious
or
lethargic
;
and
the
doctor
forbid
everything
which
could
painfully
excite
her
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
I
get
on
as
well
as
I
could
with
Georgiana
and
Eliza
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
cold
,
indeed
,
at
first
.
<EOS>
Eliza
would
sit
half
the
day
sewing
,
reading
,
or
writing
,
and
scarcely
utter
a
word
either
to
me
or
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
would
chatter
nonsense
to
her
canary
bird
by
the
hour
,
and
take
no
notice
of
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
determine
not
to
seem
at
a
loss
for
occupation
or
amusement
:
I
have
bring
my
drawing
material
with
me
,
and
they
serve
me
for
both
.
  
<EOS>
provide
with
a
case
of
pencil
,
and
some
sheet
of
paper
,
I
use
to
take
a
seat
apart
from
them
,
near
the
window
,
and
busy
myself
in
sketch
fancy
vignette
,
represent
any
scene
that
happen
momentarily
to
shape
itself
in
the
ever
-
shift
kaleidoscope
of
imagination
:
a
glimpse
of
sea
between
two
rock
;
the
rise
moon
,
and
a
ship
cross
its
disk
;
a
group
of
reed
and
water
-
flag
,
and
a
naiad
's
head
,
crown
with
lotus-
flower
,
rise
out
of
them
;
an
elf
sit
in
a
hedge
-
sparrow
's
nest
,
under
a
wreath
of
hawthorn
-
bloom
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
I
fall
to
sketch
a
face
:
<EOS>
what
sort
of
a
face
it
be
to
be
,
I
do
not
care
or
know
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
soft
black
pencil
,
give
it
a
broad
point
,
and
work
away
.
<EOS>
soon
I
have
trace
on
the
paper
a
broad
and
prominent
forehead
and
a
square
low
outline
of
visage
:
<EOS>
that
contour
give
me
pleasure
;
my
finger
proceed
actively
to
fill
it
with
feature
.
<EOS>
strongly
-
mark
horizontal
eyebrow
must
be
trace
under
that
brow
;
then
follow
,
naturally
,
a
well
-
define
nose
,
with
a
straight
ridge
and
full
nostril
;
then
a
flexible
-
look
mouth
,
by
no
means
narrow
;
then
a
firm
chin
,
with
a
decide
cleave
down
the
middle
of
it
:
of
course
,
some
black
whisker
be
want
,
and
some
jetty
hair
,
tufte
on
the
temple
,
and
wave
above
the
forehead
.
<EOS>
now
for
the
eye
:
I
have
leave
them
to
the
last
,
because
they
require
the
most
careful
working
.
<EOS>
I
draw
them
large
;
I
shape
them
well
:
<EOS>
the
eyelash
I
trace
long
and
sombre
;
the
irid
lustrous
and
large
.
"
<EOS>
good
!
<EOS>
but
not
quite
the
thing
<EOS>
,
"
I
think
,
as
I
survey
the
effect
:
"
they
want
more
force
and
spirit
;
"
and
I
work
the
shade
blacker
,
that
the
light
may
flash
more
brilliantly
 
<EOS>
a
happy
touch
or
two
secured
success
.
<EOS>
there
,
I
have
a
friend
's
face
under
my
gaze
;
and
what
do
it
signify
that
those
young
lady
turn
their
back
on
me
?
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
;
I
smile
at
the
speaking
likeness
:
I
be
absorb
and
content
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
a
portrait
of
some
one
you
know
?
"
ask
Eliza
,
who
have
approach
me
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
I
respond
that
it
be
merely
a
fancy
head
,
and
hurry
it
beneath
the
other
sheet
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
lie
:
<EOS>
it
be
,
in
fact
,
a
very
faithful
representation
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
that
to
her
,
or
to
any
one
but
myself
?
<EOS>
Georgiana
also
advance
to
look
.
<EOS>
the
other
drawing
please
her
much
,
but
she
call
that
"
an
ugly
man
.
<EOS>
"
They
both
seem
surprised
at
my
skill
.
<EOS>
I
offer
to
sketch
their
portrait
;
and
each
,
in
turn
,
sit
for
a
pencil
outline
.
<EOS>
then
Georgiana
produce
her
album
.
<EOS>
I
promise
to
contribute
a
water
-
colour
drawing
:
this
put
her
at
once
into
good
humour
.
<EOS>
She
propose
a
walk
in
the
ground
.
<EOS>
before
we
have
be
out
two
hour
,
we
be
deep
in
a
confidential
conversation
:
she
have
favour
me
with
a
description
of
the
brilliant
winter
she
have
spend
in
London
two
season
ago
 
of
the
admiration
she
have
there
excite
 
the
attention
she
have
receive
;
and
I
even
get
hint
of
the
title
conquest
she
have
make
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
these
hint
be
enlarge
on
:
various
soft
conversation
be
report
,
and
sentimental
scene
represent
;
and
,
in
short
,
a
volume
of
a
novel
of
fashionable
life
be
that
day
improvise
by
her
for
my
benefit
.
<EOS>
the
communication
be
renew
from
day
to
day
:
they
always
run
on
the
same
theme
 
herself
,
her
love
,
and
woe
.
<EOS>
It
be
strange
she
never
once
advert
either
to
her
mother
's
illness
,
or
her
brother
's
death
,
or
the
present
gloomy
state
of
the
family
prospect
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
seem
wholly
take
up
with
reminiscence
of
past
gaiety
,
and
aspiration
after
dissipation
to
come
.
<EOS>
She
pass
about
five
minute
each
day
in
her
mother
's
sick
-
room
,
and
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Eliza
still
speak
little
:
she
have
evidently
no
time
to
talk
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
busy
person
than
she
seem
to
be
;
yet
it
be
difficult
to
say
what
she
do
:
or
rather
,
to
discover
any
result
of
her
diligence
.
<EOS>
She
have
an
alarm
to
call
her
up
early
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
she
occupy
herself
before
breakfast
,
but
after
that
meal
she
divide
her
time
into
regular
portion
,
and
each
hour
have
its
allot
task
.
<EOS>
three
time
a
day
she
study
a
little
book
,
which
I
find
,
on
inspection
,
<EOS>
be
a
Common
Prayer
Book
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
once
what
be
the
great
attraction
of
that
volume
,
and
she
say
,
"
the
Rubric
.
<EOS>
"
three
hour
she
give
to
stitching
,
with
gold
thread
,
the
border
of
a
square
crimson
cloth
,
almost
large
enough
for
a
carpet
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
after
the
use
of
this
article
,
she
inform
me
it
be
a
covering
for
the
altar
of
a
new
church
lately
erect
near
Gateshead
.
<EOS>
two
hour
she
devote
to
her
diary
;
two
to
work
by
herself
in
the
kitchen
-
garden
;
and
one
to
the
regulation
of
her
account
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
want
no
company
;
no
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
be
happy
in
her
way
:
this
routine
suffice
for
her
;
and
nothing
annoy
her
so
much
as
the
occurrence
of
any
incident
which
force
her
to
vary
its
clockwork
regularity
.
  
<EOS>
She
tell
me
one
evening
,
when
more
disposed
to
be
communicative
than
usual
,
that
John
's
conduct
,
and
the
threaten
ruin
of
the
family
,
have
be
a
source
of
profound
affliction
to
her
:
but
<EOS>
she
have
now
,
she
say
,
settle
her
mind
,
and
form
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
Her
own
fortune
she
have
take
care
to
secure
;
and
when
her
mother
die
 
and
it
be
wholly
improbable
,
she
tranquilly
remark
,
that
she
should
either
recover
or
linger
long
 
<EOS>
she
would
execute
a
long
-
cherish
project
:
seek
a
retirement
where
punctual
habit
would
be
permanently
secure
from
disturbance
,
and
place
safe
barrier
between
herself
and
a
frivolous
world
.
<EOS>
I
ask
if
Georgiana
would
accompany
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
and
<EOS>
she
have
nothing
in
common
:
they
never
have
have
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
burden
with
her
society
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
should
take
her
own
course
;
and
she
,
Eliza
,
would
take
hers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Georgiana
,
when
not
unburden
her
heart
to
me
,
spend
most
of
her
time
in
lie
on
the
sofa
,
fret
about
the
dulness
of
the
house
,
and
wish
over
and
over
again
that
her
aunt
Gibson
would
send
her
an
invitation
up
to
town
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
much
well
,
"
she
say
,
"
if
she
could
only
get
out
of
the
way
for
a
month
or
two
,
till
all
be
over
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
what
she
mean
by
"
all
be
over
,
"
but
I
suppose
she
refer
to
the
expected
decease
of
her
mother
and
the
gloomy
sequel
of
funeral
rite
.
<EOS>
Eliza
generally
take
no
more
notice
of
her
sister
's
indolence
and
complaint
than
if
no
such
murmuring
,
lounge
object
have
be
before
her
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
however
,
as
she
put
away
her
account
-
book
and
unfold
her
embroidery
,
she
suddenly
take
her
up
thus
    
<EOS>
"
Georgiana
,
a
more
vain
and
absurd
animal
than
you
be
certainly
never
allow
to
cumber
the
earth
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
be
bear
,
for
you
make
no
use
of
life
.
<EOS>
instead
of
live
for
,
in
,
and
with
yourself
,
as
a
reasonable
being
ought
,
you
seek
only
to
fasten
your
feebleness
on
some
other
person
's
strength
:
if
no
one
can
be
find
willing
to
burden
her
or
himself
with
such
a
fat
,
weak
,
puffy
,
useless
thing
,
you
cry
out
that
you
be
ill
-
treat
,
neglect
,
miserable
.
<EOS>
then
,
too
,
existence
for
you
must
be
a
scene
of
continual
change
and
excitement
,
or
<EOS>
else
the
world
be
a
dungeon
:
you
must
be
admire
,
you
must
be
court
,
you
must
be
flatter
 
you
must
have
music
,
dancing
,
and
society
 
or
you
languish
,
you
die
away
.
<EOS>
have
you
no
sense
to
devise
a
system
which
will
make
you
independent
of
all
effort
,
and
all
will
,
but
your
own
?
<EOS>
take
one
day
;
share
it
into
section
;
to
each
section
apportion
its
task
<EOS>
:
leave
no
stray
unemployed
quarter
of
an
hour
,
ten
minute
,
five
minute
 
include
all
;
do
each
piece
of
business
in
its
turn
with
method
,
with
rigid
regularity
.
<EOS>
the
day
will
close
almost
before
you
be
aware
it
have
begin
;
and
you
be
indebted
to
no
one
for
help
you
to
get
rid
of
one
vacant
moment
:
you
have
have
to
seek
no
one
's
company
,
conversation
,
sympathy
,
forbearance
;
you
have
live
,
in
short
,
as
an
independent
being
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
take
this
advice
:
the
first
and
last
I
shall
offer
you
;
then
you
will
not
want
me
or
any
one
else
,
happen
what
may
.
<EOS>
neglect
it
 
go
on
as
heretofore
,
craving
,
whining
,
and
idle
 
and
suffer
the
result
of
your
idiocy
,
however
bad
and
insuperable
they
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
plainly
;
and
listen
:
for
though
I
shall
no
more
repeat
what
I
be
now
about
to
say
,
I
shall
steadily
act
on
it
.
<EOS>
after
my
mother
's
death
,
I
wash
my
hand
of
you
:
from
the
day
her
coffin
be
carry
to
the
vault
in
Gateshead
Church
,
you
and
I
will
be
as
separate
as
if
we
have
never
know
each
other
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
think
that
because
we
chance
to
be
bear
of
the
same
parent
,
I
shall
suffer
you
to
fasten
me
down
by
even
the
feeble
claim
:
I
can
tell
you
this
 
if
the
whole
human
race
,
ourselves
except
,
be
sweep
away
,
and
we
two
stand
alone
on
the
earth
,
I
would
leave
you
in
the
old
world
,
and
betake
myself
to
the
new
.

She
close
her

You
may

spare
yourself
the
trouble

that
tirade

speciman

into
circle

<EOS>
Georgiana
take
out
her
handkerchief
and
blow
her
nose
for
an
hour
afterwards
;

cold
,
impassable
,
and
assiduously
industrious

despicably
savourless

draught
indeed
;
but
judgment
untempere

bitter
and
husky
a

for

deglutition

<EOS>
It
be
a
wet
and
windy
afternoon
<EOS>
:
Georgiana
have
fall
asleep
on
the
sofa
over
the
perusal
of
a
novel
;
Eliza
be
go
to
attend
a
saint's
-
day
service
at
the
new
church
 
for
in
matter
of
religion
<EOS>
she
be
a
rigid
formalist
:
no
weather
ever
prevent
the
punctual
discharge
of
what
she
consider
her
devotional
duty
;
fair
or
foul
,
she
go
to
church
thrice
every
Sunday
,
and
as
often
on
week
-
day
as
there
be
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
I
bethink
myself
to
go
upstairs
and
see
how
the
die
woman
speed
,
who
lie
there
almost
unheeded
:
the
very
servant
pay
her
but
a
remittent
attention
:
the
hire
nurse
,
be
little
look
after
,
would
slip
out
of
the
room
whenever
she
could
.
<EOS>
Bessie
be
faithful
;
but
she
have
her
own
family
to
mind
,
and
could
only
come
occasionally
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
sick
-
room
unwatched
,
as
I
have
expect
:
no
nurse
be
there
;
the
patient
lie
still
,
and
seemingly
lethargic
;
her
livid
face
sink
in
the
pillow
:
the
fire
be
die
in
the
grate
.
<EOS>
I
renew
the
fuel
,
re
-
arrange
the
bedclothe
,
gaze
awhile
on
her
who
could
not
now
gaze
on
me
,
and
then
I
move
away
to
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
the
rain
beat
strongly
against
the
pane
,
the
wind
blow
tempestuously
:
"
one
lie
there
,
"
I
think
,
"
who
will
soon
be
beyond
the
war
of
earthly
element
.
<EOS>
Whither
will
that
spirit
 
now
struggle
to
quit
its
material
tenement
 
<EOS>
flit
when
at
length
release
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
ponder
the
great
mystery
,
I
think
of
Helen
Burns
,
recall
her
die
word
 
her
faith
 
her
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
disembody
soul
.
<EOS>
I
be
still
listen
in
thought
to
her
well

remember
tone
 
still

her
pale
and
spiritual
aspect

her
waste
face

sublime
gaze

as
she
lie
on
her
placid
deathbed
,
and
whisper
her
longing
to
be
restore
to
her
divine
Father
's
bosom
 
when
a
feeble
voice
murmur
from
the
couch
behind
:

<EOS>
I
know
Mrs.

not

I
go
up

It

Reed

<EOS>
"
who

be
her
answer

<EOS>
"
who
be
you

"
<EOS>
look
at
me
with
surprise
and
a
sort
of
alarm
,
but
still
not
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
a
stranger

You

<EOS>
I
say
nothing

I
be
afraid
of
occasion
some
shock

declare
my
identity

<EOS>

yet
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
a
mistake
:
my
thought
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
see
Jane
Eyre
,
and
I
fancy
a
likeness
where
none
exist

besides
,
in
eight
year
she
must
be
so
change

I
now
gently
assure
her
that
I
be
the

suppose
and
desire
me
to
be

and
see
that
I
be

that

quite
collect

I
explain
how
Bessie
have
send
her
husband
to
fetch
me
from
Thornfield

ill

I
be
try
to
turn
myself
a
few
minute
since

and
find
I
can
not
move
a
limb

<EOS>
It
be
as
well
I
should
ease
my
mind
before
I
die

what
we

little
of

health

burden
us

an
hour

be
to
me

there

you

I
assure
her

to
herself
:

well

<EOS>
She
make
an
effort
to
alter
her
position
,
but
fail
:
her
face
change
;
she
seem
to
experience
some
inward
sensation
 
the
precursor
,
perhaps
,
of
the
last
pang

well
,
I
must
get
it
over

eternity

I
have
better

<EOS>
go
to

It

I
could
not

your
conduct

Jane
 
the
fury
with
which
you
once
turn
on
me

the
tone
in
which
you
declare
you
abhor
me
the
bad
of
anybody

the
unchildlike
look

voice
with
which
you
affirm
that
the
very
thought

me
make
you
sick
,
and
assert
that
I
have
treat
you
with
miserable
cruelty

<EOS>
I
could
not
forget
my
own
sensation
when
you
thus
start
up
and
pour
out
the
venom
of
your
mind
:
<EOS>
I
feel
fear
as
if
an
animal
that
I
have
strike
or
push
have
look
up
at
me
with
human
eye

curse
me

nine

She
heed
nothing

when
she
have
taste
the
water
and
draw
breath
,
she
go
on
thus
    
<EOS>

I
tell
you
I
could

I
take
my
revenge

for

one

how

could
be
patient

quiescent
under
any
treatment

in

tenth
break
out
all
fire

violence

I
can
never

<EOS>
"
My
disposition
be
not
so
bad

you
think
:
I
be
passionate
,
but
not
vindictive

<EOS>
many
a
time
,
as
a
little

I
should
have
be
glad
to
love
you
if
you
would

me
;

I
long
earnestly
to
be
reconcile
to
you
now
:
kiss
me
,
aunt

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
approach
my
cheek
to
her
lip
:
she
would
not
touch
it
.
<EOS>
She
say
I
oppress
her
by
lean
over
the
bed
,
and
again
demand
water
.
<EOS>
as
I
lay
her
down
 
for
I
raise
her
and
support
her
on
my
arm
while
she
drink
 
<EOS>
I
cover
her
ice

cold

clammy
hand

mine

feeble
finger
shrink
from

glaze
eye
shun
my
gaze

<EOS>
"
love
me

then
,

I
say
at

,

you
have
my
full
and
free
forgiveness

ask
now
for
God

,
and
be
at
peace

<EOS>
poor
,
suffer
woman
!
<EOS>
it
be
too
late
for
her
to
make
now
the
effort
to
change
her
habitual
frame
of
mind
:
living
<EOS>
,
she
have
ever
hate
me
 
die
,
she
must
hate
me
still
.
  
<EOS>
the
nurse
now
enter
,
and
Bessie
follow
.
<EOS>
I
yet
linger
half
-
an
-
hour
longer
,
hope
to
see
some
sign
of
amity
:
but
she
give
none
.
<EOS>
She
be
fast
relapse
into
stupor
;
nor
do
her
mind
again
rally
:
at
twelve
o'clock
that
night
she
die
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
present
to
close
her
eye
,
nor
be
either
of
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
They
come
to
tell
us
the
next
morning
that
all
be
over
.
<EOS>
She
be
by
that
time
lay
out
.
<EOS>
Eliza
and
I
go
to
look
at
her
:
<EOS>
Georgiana
,
who
have
burst
out
into
loud
weeping
,
say
she
dare
not
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
stretch
Sarah
Reed
's
once
robust
and
active
frame
,
rigid
and
still
:
her
eye
of
flint
be
cover
with
its
cold
lid
;
her
brow
and
strong
trait
wear
yet
the
impress
of
her
inexorable
soul
.
<EOS>
a
strange
and
solemn
object
be
that
corpse
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
gaze
on
it
with
gloom
and
pain
:
nothing
soft
,
nothing
sweet
,
nothing
pity
,
or
hopeful
,
or
subduing
do
it
inspire
;
only
a
grating
anguish
for
_
her
<EOS>
_
woe
 
not
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
my
_
loss
 
and
a
sombre
tearless
dismay
at
the
fearfulness
of
death
in
such
a
form
.
  
<EOS>
Eliza
survey
her
parent
calmly
.
<EOS>
after
a
silence
of
some
minute
she
observe
    
<EOS>
"
with
her
constitution
she
should
have
live
to
a
good
old
age
:
her
life
be
shorten
by
trouble
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
a
spasm
constrict
her
mouth
for
an
instant
:
<EOS>
as
it
pass
away
she
turn
and
leave
the
room
,
and
so
do
I.
neither
of
us
have
dropt
a
tear
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
have
give
me
but
one
week
's
leave
of
absence
:
yet
a
month
elapse
before
I
quit
Gateshead
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
leave
immediately
after
the
funeral
,
but
Georgiana
entreat
me
to
stay
till
she
could
get
off
to
London
,
whither
<EOS>
she
be
now
at
last
invite
by
her
uncle
,
Mr.
Gibson
,
who
have
come
down
to
direct
his
sister
's
interment
and
settle
the
family
affair
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
say
she
dread
be
leave
alone
with
Eliza
;
from
her
she
get
neither
sympathy
in
her
dejection
,
support
in
her
fear
,
nor
aid
in
her
preparation
;
so
I
bear
with
her
feeble
-
minded
wailing
and
selfish
lamentation
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
do
my
good
in
sewing
for
her
and
pack
her
dress
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
that
while
I
work
,
she
would
idle
;
and
I
think
to
myself
,
"
if
you
and
I
be
destine
to
live
always
together
,
cousin
,
we
would
commence
matter
on
a
different
footing
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
settle
tamely
down
into
be
the
forbear
party
;
I
should
assign
you
your
share
of
labour
,
and
compel
you
to
accomplish
it
,
or
else
<EOS>
it
should
be
leave
undone
:
I
should
insist
,
also
,
on
your
keeping
some
of
those
drawl
,
half
-
insincere
complaint
hush
in
your
own
breast
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
because
our
connection
happen
to
be
very
transitory
,
and
come
at
a
peculiarly
mournful
season
,
that
I
consent
thus
to
render
it
so
patient
and
compliant
on
my
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
last
I
see
Georgiana
off
;
but
now
it
be
Eliza
's
turn
to
request
me
to
stay
another
week
.
<EOS>
Her
plan
require
all
her
time
and
attention
<EOS>
,
she
say
;
she
be
about
to
depart
for
some
unknown
bourne
;
and
all
day
long
she
stay
in
her
own
room
,
her
door
bolt
within
,
fill
trunk
,
empty
drawer
,
burn
paper
,
and
hold
no
communication
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
She
wish
me
to
look
after
the
house
,
to
see
caller
,
and
answer
note
of
condolence
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
she
tell
me
I
be
at
liberty
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
"
she
add
,
"
I
be
oblige
to
you
for
your
valuable
service
and
discreet
conduct
!
<EOS>
there
be
some
difference
between
live
with
such
an
one
as
you
and
with
Georgiana
:
you
perform
your
own
part
in
life
and
burden
no
one
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
,
"
she
continue
,
"
I
set
out
for
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
up
my
abode
in
a
religious
house
near
Lisle
 
a
nunnery
you
would
call
it
;
there
I
shall
be
quiet
and
unmolested
.
<EOS>
I
shall
devote
myself
for
a
time
to
the
examination
of
the
roman
catholic
dogmas
,
and
to
a
careful
study
of
the
working
of
their
system
:
if
I
find
it
to
be
,
as
I
half
suspect
it
be
,
the
one
best
calculate
to
ensure
the
doing
of
all
thing
decently
and
in
order
,
I
shall
embrace
the
tenet
of
Rome
and
probably
take
the
veil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
neither
express
surprise
at
this
resolution
nor
attempt
to
dissuade
her
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
the
vocation
will
fit
you
to
a
hair
,
"
I
think
:
"
much
good
may
it
do
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
when
we
part
,
she
say
:
"
good
-
bye
,
cousin
Jane
Eyre
<EOS>
;
I
wish
you
well
:
you
have
some
sense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
then
return
:
"
You
be
not
without
sense
,
cousin
Eliza
;
but
what
you
have
,
I
suppose
,
in
another
year
will
be
wall
up
alive
in
a
french
convent
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
not
my
business
,
and
so
it
suit
you
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
much
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
in
the
right
,
"
say
she
;
and
with
these
word
we
each
go
our
separate
way
.
<EOS>
as
I
shall
not
have
occasion
to
refer
either
to
her
or
her
sister
again
,
I
may
as
well
mention
here
,
that
Georgiana
make
an
advantageous
match
with
a
wealthy
wear
-
out
man
of
fashion
,
and
that
Eliza
actually
take
the
veil
,
and
be
at
this
day
superior
of
the
convent
where
she
pass
the
period
of
her
novitiate
,
and
which
she
endow
with
her
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
how
people
feel
when
they
be
return
home
from
an
absence
,
long
or
short
,
I
do
not
know
:
<EOS>
I
have
never
experience
the
sensation
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
what
it
be
to
come
back
to
Gateshead
when
a
child
after
a
long
walk
,
to
be
scold
for
look
cold
or
gloomy
;
and
later
,
what
it
be
to
come
back
from
church
to
Lowood
,
to
long
for
a
plenteous
meal
and
a
good
fire
,
and
to
be
unable
to
get
either
.
<EOS>
neither
of
these
returning
be
very
pleasant
or
desirable
:
no
magnet
draw
me
to
a
give
point
,
increase
in
its
strength
of
attraction
the
nearer
I
come
.
<EOS>
the
return
to
Thornfield
be
yet
to
be
try
.
  
<EOS>
My
journey
seem
tedious
 
very
tedious
:
fifty
mile
one
day
,
a
night
spend
at
an
inn
;
fifty
mile
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
during
the
first
twelve
hour
I
think
of
Mrs.
Reed
in
her
last
moment
;
I
see
her
disfigured
and
discolour
face
,
and
hear
her
strangely
alter
voice
.
<EOS>
I
muse
on
the
funeral
day
,
the
coffin
,
the
hearse
,
the
black
train
of
tenant
and
servant
 
<EOS>
few
be
the
number
of
relative
 
the
gape
vault
,
the
silent
church
,
the
solemn
service
.
<EOS>
then
I
think
of
Eliza
and
Georgiana
;
I
beheld
one
the
cynosure
of
a
ball
-
room
,
the
other
the
inmate
of
a
convent
cell
;
and
I
dwelt
on
and
analyse
their
separate
peculiarity
of
person
and
character
.
<EOS>
the
evening
arrival
at
the
great
town
of
 
scatter
these
thought
;
night
give
them
quite
another
turn
:
lay
down
on
my
traveller
's
bed
,
I
leave
reminiscence
for
anticipation
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
back
to
Thornfield
:
<EOS>
but
how
long
be
I
to
stay
there
?
<EOS>
not
long
;
of
that
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
from
Mrs.
Fairfax
in
the
interim
of
my
absence
:
the
party
at
the
hall
be
disperse
;
Mr.
Rochester
have
leave
for
London
three
week
ago
,
but
he
be
then
expect
to
return
in
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
surmise
that
he
be
go
to
make
arrangement
for
his
wedding
,
as
he
have
talk
of
purchase
a
new
carriage
:
she
say
the
idea
of
his
marrying
Miss
Ingram
still
seem
strange
to
her
;
but
from
what
everybody
say
,
and
from
what
she
have
herself
see
,
she
could
no
longer
doubt
that
the
event
would
shortly
take
place
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
strangely
incredulous
if
you
do
doubt
it
,
"
be
my
mental
comment
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
question
follow
,
"
where
be
I
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
I
dreamt
of
Miss
Ingram
all
the
night
:
in
a
vivid
morning
dream
I
see
her
close
the
gate
of
Thornfield
against
me
and
point
me
out
another
road
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
look
on
with
his
arm
fold
 
smile
sardonically
,
as
it
seem
,
at
both
her
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
notify
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
the
exact
day
of
my
return
;
for
I
do
not
wish
either
car
or
carriage
to
meet
me
at
Millcote
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
walk
the
distance
quietly
by
myself
;
and
very
quietly
,
after
leave
my
box
in
the
ostler
's
care
,
do
I
slip
away
from
the
George
Inn
,
about
six
o'clock
of
a
June
evening
,
and
take
the
old
road
to
Thornfield
:
a
road
which
lie
chiefly
through
field
,
and
be
now
little
frequented
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
bright
or
splendid
summer
evening
,
though
fair
and
soft
:
the
haymaker
be
at
work
all
along
the
road
;
and
the
sky
,
though
far
from
cloudless
,
be
such
as
promise
well
for
the
future
:
<EOS>
its
blue
 
where
blue
be
visible
 
be
mild
and
settle
,
and
its
cloud
strata
high
and
thin
.
<EOS>
the
west
,
too
,
be
warm
:
no
watery
gleam
chill
it
 
<EOS>
it
seem
as
if
there
be
a
fire
lit
,
an
altar
burn
behind
its
screen
of
marbled
vapour
,
and
out
of
aperture
shine
a
golden
redness
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
glad
as
the
road
shorten
before
me
:
<EOS>
so
glad
that
I
stop
once
to
ask
myself
what
that
joy
mean
:
and
to
remind
reason
that
it
be
not
to
my
home
<EOS>
I
be
go
,
or
to
a
permanent
resting
-
place
,
or
to
a
place
where
fond
friend
look
out
for
me
and
wait
my
arrival
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
will
smile
you
a
calm
welcome
,
to
be
sure
,
"
say
I
;
"
and
little
Adele
will
clap
her
hand
and
jump
to
see
you
:
but
you
know
very
well
you
be
think
of
another
than
they
,
and
that
he
be
not
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
what
be
so
headstrong
as
youth
?
<EOS>
what
so
blind
as
inexperience
?
<EOS>
these
affirm
that
it
be
pleasure
enough
to
have
the
privilege
of
again
look
on
Mr.
Rochester
,
whether
he
look
on
me
or
not
;
and
they
add
 
"
Hasten
!
<EOS>
hasten
!
<EOS>
be
with
him
while
you
may
:
but
a
few
more
day
or
week
,
at
most
,
and
you
be
part
from
him
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
strangle
a
new
-
bear
agony
 
a
deformed
thing
which
I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
own
and
rear
 
and
run
on
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
make
hay
,
too
,
in
Thornfield
meadow
:
or
rather
,
the
labourer
be
just
quit
their
work
,
and
return
home
with
their
rake
on
their
shoulder
,
now
,
at
the
hour
I
arrive
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
a
field
or
two
to
traverse
,
and
then
I
shall
cross
the
road
and
reach
the
gate
.
<EOS>
how
full
the
hedge
be
of
rose
!
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
time
to
gather
any
;
I
want
to
be
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
pass
a
tall
briar
,
shoot
leafy
and
flowery
branch
across
the
path
;
I
see
the
narrow
stile
with
stone
step
;
and
I
see
 
Mr.
Rochester
sit
there
,
a
book
and
a
pencil
in
his
hand
;
he
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
he
be
not
a
ghost
;
yet
every
nerve
I
have
be
unstrung
:
for
a
moment
I
be
beyond
my
own
mastery
.
<EOS>
what
do
it
mean
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
should
tremble
in
this
way
when
I
see
him
,
or
lose
my
voice
or
the
power
of
motion
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
back
as
soon
as
I
can
stir
:
<EOS>
I
need
not
make
an
absolute
fool
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
know
another
way
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
signify
if
I
know
twenty
way
;
for
he
have
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hillo
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
;
and
he
put
up
his
book
and
his
pencil
.
<EOS>
"
there
you
be
!
<EOS>
come
on
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
do
come
on
;
though
in
what
fashion
I
know
not
;
be
scarcely
cognisant
of
my
movement
,
and
solicitous
only
to
appear
calm
;
and
,
above
all
,
to
control
the
work
muscle
of
my
face
 
which
I
feel
rebel
insolently
against
my
will
,
and
struggle
to
express
what
I
have
resolve
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
veil
 
<EOS>
it
be
down
:
I
may
make
shift
yet
to
behave
with
decent
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
this
be
Jane
Eyre
?
<EOS>
be
you
come
from
Millcote
,
and
on
foot
?
<EOS>
yes
 
just
one
of
your
trick
:
not
to
send
for
a
carriage
,
and
come
clatter
over
street
and
road
like
a
common
mortal
,
but
to
steal
into
the
vicinage
of
your
home
along
with
twilight
,
just
as
if
you
be
a
dream
or
a
shade
.
<EOS>
what
the
deuce
have
you
do
with
yourself
this
last
month
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
with
my
aunt
,
sir
,
who
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
true
janian
reply
!
<EOS>
good
angel
be
my
guard
!
<EOS>
She
come
from
the
other
world
 
from
the
abode
of
people
who
be
dead
;
and
tell
me
so
when
she
meet
me
alone
here
in
the
gloaming
!
<EOS>
if
I
dare
,
I
would
touch
you
,
to
see
if
you
be
substance
or
shadow
,
you
elf
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
would
as
soon
offer
to
take
hold
of
a
blue
_
ignis
fatuu
_
light
in
a
marsh
.
<EOS>
truant
!
truant
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
when
he
have
pause
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
absent
from
me
a
whole
month
,
and
forget
me
quite
,
I
will
be
swear
!
"
  
I
know
there
would
be
pleasure
in
meet
my
master
again
,
even
though
break
by
the
fear
that
he
be
so
soon
to
cease
to
be
my
master
,
and
by
the
knowledge
that
I
be
nothing
to
him
:
but
there
be
ever
in
Mr.
Rochester
(
so
at
least
I
think
)
<EOS>
such
a
wealth
of
the
power
of
communicate
happiness
,
that
to
taste
but
of
the
crumb
he
scatter
to
stray
and
strange
bird
like
me
,
be
to
feast
genially
.
<EOS>
His
last
word
be
balm
:
they
seem
to
imply
that
it
import
something
to
him
whether
I
forget
him
or
not
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
speak
of
Thornfield
as
my
home
 
would
that
it
be
my
home
!
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
leave
the
stile
,
and
I
hardly
like
to
ask
to
go
by
.
<EOS>
I
inquire
soon
if
he
have
not
be
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
suppose
you
find
that
out
by
second
-
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Fairfax
tell
me
in
a
letter
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
do
she
inform
you
what
I
go
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
sir
!
<EOS>
everybody
know
your
errand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
see
the
carriage
,
Jane
,
and
tell
me
if
you
do
not
think
it
will
suit
Mrs.
Rochester
exactly
;
and
whether
she
will
not
look
like
Queen
Boadicea
,
lean
back
against
those
purple
cushion
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
Jane
,
I
be
a
trifle
better
adapt
to
match
with
her
externally
.
<EOS>
tell
me
now
,
fairy
as
you
be
 
can
not
you
give
me
a
charm
,
or
a
philter
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
to
make
me
a
handsome
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
past
the
power
of
magic
,
sir
;
"
and
,
in
thought
,
I
add
,
"
a
loving
eye
be
all
the
charm
need
:
to
such
you
be
handsome
enough
;
or
rather
your
sternness
have
a
power
beyond
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
have
sometimes
read
my
unspoken
thought
with
an
acuman
to
me
incomprehensible
:
in
the
present
instance
he
take
no
notice
of
my
abrupt
vocal
response
;
but
he
smile
at
me
with
a
certain
smile
he
have
of
his
own
,
and
which
he
use
but
on
rare
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
think
it
too
good
for
common
purpose
:
it
be
the
real
sunshine
of
feeling
 
he
shed
it
over
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
pass
,
Janet
,
"
say
he
,
make
room
for
me
to
cross
the
stile
:
"
go
up
home
,
and
stay
your
weary
little
wander
foot
at
a
friend
's
threshold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
all
I
have
now
to
do
be
to
obey
him
in
silence
:
<EOS>
no
need
for
me
to
colloquise
further
.
<EOS>
I
get
over
the
stile
without
a
word
,
and
mean
to
leave
him
calmly
.
<EOS>
an
impulse
hold
me
fast
 
<EOS>
a
force
turn
me
round
.
<EOS>
I
say
 
or
something
in
me
say
for
me
,
and
in
spite
of
me
    
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
for
your
great
kindness
.
<EOS>
I
be
strangely
glad
to
get
back
again
to
you
:
and
wherever
you
be
be
my
home
 
<EOS>
my
only
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
walk
on
so
fast
that
even
he
could
hardly
have
overtake
me
<EOS>
have
he
try
.
<EOS>
Little
Adele
be
half
wild
with
delight
when
she
see
me
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
receive
me
with
her
usual
plain
friendliness
.
<EOS>
Leah
smile
,
and
even
Sophie
bid
me
"
bon
soir
"
with
glee
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
pleasant
;
there
be
no
happiness
like
that
of
be
love
by
your
fellow
-
creature
,
and
feeling
that
your
presence
be
an
addition
to
their
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
I
that
evening
shut
my
eye
resolutely
against
the
future
:
I
stop
my
ear
against
the
voice
that
keep
warn
me
of
near
separation
and
come
grief
.
<EOS>
when
tea
be
over
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
take
her
knitting
,
and
I
have
assume
a
low
seat
near
her
,
and
<EOS>
Adele
,
kneel
on
the
carpet
,
have
nestle
close
up
to
me
,
and
a
sense
of
mutual
affection
seem
to
surround
us
with
a
ring
of
golden
peace
,
I
utter
a
silent
prayer
that
we
may
not
be
part
far
or
soon
;
but
when
,
as
we
thus
sit
,
Mr.
Rochester
enter
,
unannounced
,
and
look
at
us
,
seem
to
take
pleasure
in
the
spectacle
of
a
group
<EOS>
so
amicable
 
<EOS>
when
he
say
he
suppose
the
old
lady
be
all
right
now
that
she
have
get
her
adopt
daughter
back
again
,
and
add
that
he
see
Adele
be
"
prete
<EOS>
a
croquer
sa
petite
maman
Anglaise
"
 
<EOS>
I
half
venture
to
hope
that
he
would
,
even
after
his
marriage
,
keep
us
together
somewhere
under
the
shelter
of
his
protection
,
and
not
quite
exile
from
the
sunshine
of
his
presence
.
  
<EOS>
a
fortnight
of
dubious
calm
succeed
my
return
to
Thornfield
Hall
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
say
of
the
master
's
marriage
,
and
I
see
no
preparation
go
on
for
such
an
event
.
<EOS>
almost
every
day
I
ask
Mrs.
Fairfax
if
she
have
yet
hear
anything
decide
:
her
answer
be
always
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
once
she
say
she
have
actually
put
the
question
to
Mr.
Rochester
as
to
when
he
be
go
to
bring
his
bride
home
;
but
he
have
answer
her
only
by
a
joke
and
one
of
his
queer
look
,
and
she
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
specially
surprise
me
,
and
that
be
,
there
be
no
journeying
backward
and
forward
,
<EOS>
no
visit
to
Ingram
Park
:
to
be
sure
it
be
twenty
mile
off
,
on
the
border
of
another
county
;
but
what
be
that
distance
to
an
ardent
lover
?
<EOS>
to
so
practised
and
indefatigable
a
horseman
as
Mr.
Rochester
,
it
would
be
but
a
morning
's
ride
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
cherish
hope
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
conceive
:
that
the
match
be
break
off
;
that
rumour
have
be
mistake
;
that
one
or
both
party
have
change
their
mind
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
look
at
my
master
's
face
to
see
if
it
be
sad
or
fierce
;
but
I
could
not
remember
the
time
when
it
have
be
so
uniformly
clear
of
cloud
or
evil
feeling
.
<EOS>
if
,
in
the
moment
I
and
my
pupil
spend
with
him
,
I
lack
spirit
and
sink
into
inevitable
dejection
,
he
become
even
gay
.
<EOS>
never
have
he
call
me
more
frequently
to
his
presence
;
never
be
kind
to
me
when
there
 
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
never
have
I
love
him
so
well
.
    
<EOS>
a
splendid
Midsummer
shone
over
England
:
<EOS>
sky
so
pure
,
sun
<EOS>
so
radiant
as
be
then
see
in
long
succession
<EOS>
,
seldom
favour
even
singly
,
our
wave-
girt
land
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
a
band
of
italian
day
have
come
from
the
South
,
like
a
flock
of
glorious
passenger
bird
,
and
light
to
rest
them
on
the
cliff
of
Albion
.
<EOS>
the
hay
be
all
get
in
;
the
field
round
Thornfield
be
green
and
shorn
;
the
road
white
and
bake
;
the
tree
be
in
their
dark
prime
;
hedge
and
wood
,
full
-
leaved
and
deeply
tint
,
contrast
well
with
the
sunny
hue
of
the
clear
meadow
between
.
  
<EOS>
on
Midsummer
-
eve
,
Adele
,
weary
with
gather
wild
strawberry
in
Hay
Lane
half
the
day
,
have
go
to
bed
with
the
sun
.
<EOS>
I
watch
her
drop
asleep
,
and
when
I
leave
her
,
I
seek
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
sweetest
hour
of
the
twenty
-
four
:
 
<EOS>
"
day
its
fervid
fire
have
waste
,
"
and
dew
fall
cool
on
pant
plain
and
scorched
summit
.
<EOS>
where
the
sun
have
go
down
in
simple
state
 
pure
of
the
pomp
of
cloud
 
spread
a
solemn
purple
,
burn
with
the
light
of
red
jewel
and
furnace
flame
at
one
point
,
on
one
hill
-
peak
,
and
extend
high
and
wide
,
soft
and
still
soft
,
over
half
heaven
.
<EOS>
the
east
have
its
own
charm
or
fine
deep
blue
,
and
its
own
modest
gem
,
a
casino
and
solitary
star
:
soon
it
would
boast
the
moon
;
but
she
be
yet
beneath
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
a
while
on
the
pavement
;
but
a
subtle
,
well
-
know
scent
 
that
of
a
cigar
 
stole
from
some
window
;
I
see
the
library
casement
open
a
handbreadth
;
I
know
I
may
be
watch
thence
;
so
I
go
apart
into
the
orchard
.
<EOS>
no
nook
in
the
ground
more
sheltered
and
more
Eden
-
like
<EOS>
;
it
be
full
of
tree
,
it
bloom
with
flower
:
a
very
high
wall
shut
it
out
from
the
court
,
on
one
side
;
on
the
other
,
a
beech
avenue
screen
it
from
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
be
a
sink
fence
;
its
sole
separation
from
lonely
field
:
a
winding
walk
,
border
with
laurel
and
terminate
in
a
giant
horse
-
chestnut
,
circle
at
the
base
by
a
seat
,
lead
down
to
the
fence
.
<EOS>
here
one
could
wander
unseen
.
<EOS>
while
such
honey
-
dew
fall
,
such
silence
reign
,
such
gloaming
gather
,
I
feel
as
if
I
could
haunt
such
shade
for
ever
;
but
in
thread
the
flower
and
fruit
parterre
at
the
upper
part
of
the
enclosure
,
entice
there
by
the
light
the
now
rise
moon
cast
on
this
more
open
quarter
,
my
step
be
stay
 
not
by
sound
,
not
by
sight
,
but
once
more
by
a
warning
fragrance
.
  
<EOS>
Sweet
-
briar
and
southernwood
,
jasmine
,
pink
,
and
rise
have
long
be
yield
their
evening
sacrifice
of
incense
:
this
new
scent
be
neither
of
shrub
nor
flower
;
it
be
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
it
be
Mr.
Rochester
's
cigar
.
<EOS>
I
look
round
and
I
listen
.
<EOS>
I
see
tree
laden
with
ripen
fruit
.
<EOS>
I
hear
a
nightingale
warbling
in
a
wood
half
a
mile
off
;
no
move
form
be
visible
,
no
coming
step
audible
;
but
that
perfume
increase
:
I
must
flee
.
<EOS>
I
make
for
the
wicket
lead
to
the
shrubbery
,
and
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
enter
.
<EOS>
I
step
aside
into
the
ivy
recess
;
he
will
not
stay
long
:
he
will
soon
return
whence
he
come
,
and
if
I
sit
still
he
will
never
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
no
 
eventide
be
as
pleasant
to
him
as
to
me
,
and
this
antique
garden
as
attractive
;
and
he
stroll
on
,
now
lift
the
gooseberry
-
tree
branch
to
look
at
the
fruit
,
large
as
plum
,
with
which
they
be
laden
;
now
take
a
ripe
cherry
from
the
wall
;
now
stoop
towards
a
knot
of
flower
,
either
to
inhale
their
fragrance
or
to
admire
the
dew
-
bead
on
their
petal
.
<EOS>
a
great
moth
go
hum
by
me
;
it
alight
on
a
plant
at
Mr.
Rochester
's
foot
:
<EOS>
he
see
it
,
and
bend
to
examine
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
he
have
his
back
towards
me
,
"
think
I
,
"
and
he
be
occupy
too
;
perhaps
,
if
I
walk
softly
,
I
can
slip
away
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
trode
on
an
edging
of
turf
that
the
crackle
of
the
pebbly
gravel
may
not
betray
me
:
he
be
stand
among
the
bed
at
a
yard
or
two
distant
from
where
I
have
to
pass
;
the
moth
apparently
engage
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
get
by
very
well
,
"
I
meditate
.
<EOS>
as
I
cross
his
shadow
,
throw
long
over
the
garden
by
the
moon
,
not
yet
rise
high
,
he
say
quietly
,
without
turn
    
"
Jane
,
come
and
look
at
this
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
make
no
noise
:
he
have
not
eye
behind
 
could
his
shadow
feel
?
<EOS>
I
start
at
first
,
and
then
I
approach
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
at
his
wing
,
"
say
he
,
"
he
remind
me
rather
of
a
west
indian
insect
;
one
do
not
often
see
so
large
and
gay
a
night
-
rover
in
England
;
there
!
<EOS>
he
be
fly
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
moth
roam
away
.
<EOS>
I
be
sheepishly
retreat
also
;
but
Mr.
Rochester
follow
me
,
and
when
we
reach
the
wicket
,
he
say
    
"
turn
back
:
on
so
lovely
a
night
<EOS>
it
be
a
shame
to
sit
in
the
house
;
and
surely
no
one
can
wish
to
go
to
bed
while
sunset
be
thus
at
meeting
with
moonrise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
my
fault
,
that
though
my
tongue
be
sometimes
prompt
enough
at
an
answer
,
there
be
time
when
it
sadly
fail
me
in
frame
an
excuse
;
and
always
the
lapse
occur
at
some
crisis
,
when
a
facile
word
or
plausible
pretext
be
specially
want
to
get
me
out
of
painful
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
walk
at
this
hour
alone
with
Mr.
Rochester
in
the
shadowy
orchard
;
but
I
could
not
find
a
reason
to
allege
for
leave
him
.
<EOS>
I
follow
with
lag
step
,
and
thought
busily
bent
on
discover
a
means
of
extrication
;
but
he
himself
look
so
composed
and
<EOS>
so
grave
<EOS>
also
,
I
become
ashamed
of
feel
any
confusion
:
<EOS>
the
evil
 
<EOS>
if
evil
existent
or
prospective
there
be
 
seem
to
lie
with
me
only
;
his
mind
be
unconscious
and
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
"
he
recommence
,
as
we
enter
the
laurel
walk
,
and
slowly
stray
down
in
the
direction
of
the
sink
fence
and
the
horse
-
chestnut
,
"
Thornfield
be
a
pleasant
place
in
summer
,
be
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
become
in
some
degree
attach
to
the
house

you

an
eye
for
natural
beauty
,
and
a
good
deal
of

organ
of
Adhesiveness

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
attach
to
it
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
though
I
do
not
comprehend
how
it
be
,
I
perceive
you
have
acquire
a
degree
of
regard
for
that
foolish
little
child
Adele

too
;
and
even
for
simple
dame
Fairfax

<EOS>

<EOS>

yes

in

I

be
sorry

"
yes

"
pity

<EOS>
he
say
,
and
sigh
and
paused
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
always
the
way
of
event
in
this
life

"
he
continue
presently
:
"
no
sooner
have
you
get
settle
in
a
pleasant
resting

a

to
enter
into
the
holy
estate

matrimony
 
to
take
Miss

I
wish
to
remind
you

first
say
to
me
,
with
that
discretion
I
respect
in

prudence

I
pass
over
the

convey
in

suggestion
on
the
character
of
my
beloved

indeed
,
when
you
be
far
away

I
will
try
to

I
shall
notice
only
its

which
be
such

I
have
make
it
my

<EOS>
Adele

<EOS>
"
yes

I
will
advertise
immediately

I
be
go

"
I
suppose
I
may
stay
here

till
I
find
another
shelter
to
betake
myself
to
:

but
I
stop

feel

<EOS>
"
in
about

month
I
hope
to
be
a
bridegroom

continue
Mr.

in

I
shall
myself
look
out

<EOS>

oh

no

<EOS>
I
consider
that
when
a
dependent
do
her
duty
as
well
as
you
have
do
yours
,
she
have
a
sort
of
claim
upon
her
employer
for
any
little
assistance
he
can
conveniently
render
her
;
indeed
I
have
already
,
through
my
future
mother
-
in
-
law
,
hear
of
a
place
that
I
think
will
suit
:
it
be
to
undertake
the
education
of
the
five
daughter
of
Mrs.
Dionysius
O'Gall
of
Bitternutt
Lodge
,
Connaught
,
Ireland
.
<EOS>
You
will
like
Ireland
<EOS>
,
I
think
:
they
be
such
warm
-
hearted
people
there
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
be
a
long
way
off
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
matter
 
a
girl
of
your
sense
will
not
object
to
the
voyage
or
the
distance

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
voyage
,
but
the
distance
:
<EOS>
and
then
the
sea
be
a
barrier

"
from
what
,
Jane

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
from

well

from

you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
this
almost
involuntarily
,
and
,
with
as
little
sanction
of
free
will
,
my
tear
gush
out
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
cry
so
as
to
be
hear
,
however
;
I
avoid
sob
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
Mrs.
O'Gall
and
Bitternutt
Lodge
strike
cold
to
my
heart
;
and
colder
the
thought
of
all
the
brine
and
foam
,
destine
,
as
it
seem
,
to
rush
between
me
and
the
master
at
whose
side
I
now
walk
,
and
coldest
the
remembrance
of
the
wide
ocean
 
wealth
,
caste
,
custom
intervene
between
me
and
what
I
naturally
and
inevitably
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
way
,
"
I
again
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
to
be
sure
;
and
when
you
get
to
Bitternutt
Lodge

Connaught

Ireland

I
shall
never
see
you
again
,
Jane

that
be
morally
certain

<EOS>
I
never
go
over
to
Ireland
,
not
have
myself
much
of
a
fancy
for
the
country

<EOS>
We
have

good

Jane

have
we
not
?

<EOS>
"
yes

"
  
<EOS>

and
when
friend
be
on
the
eve
of
separation

they
like
to
spend
the
little
time
that
remain
to
them
close
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
we
will
talk
over
the
voyage
and
the
parting
quietly
half
-
an
-
hour
or
so
,
while
the
star
enter
into
their
shine
life
up
in
heaven
yonder
:
here
be
the
chestnut
tree
:
here
be
the
bench
at
its

I

be
strong
working

sit

spark
leapt
out
of
a
cloud
at
which
I
be
look
,
and
there
be
a
crack
,
a
crash
,
and
a
close
rattle
peal
;
and
I
think
only
of
hide
my
dazzle
eye
against
Mr.
Rochester
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
the
rain
rush
down
.
<EOS>
He
hurry
me
up
the
walk
,
through
the
ground
,
and
into
the
house
;
but
we
be
quite
wet
before
we
could
pass
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
He
be
take
off
my
shawl
in
the
hall
,
and
shake
the
water
out
of
my
loosened
hair
,
when
Mrs.
Fairfax
emerge
from
her
room
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
observe
her
at
first
,
nor
do
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
the
lamp
be
light
.
<EOS>
the
clock
be
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
"
hasten
to
take
off
your
wet
thing
,
"
say
he
;
"
and
before
you
go
,
good-
night
 
<EOS>
good
-
night
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
kiss
me
repeatedly
.
<EOS>
when
I
look
up
,
on
leave
his
arm
,
there
stand
the
widow
,
pale
,
grave
,
and
amazed
.
<EOS>
I
only
smile
at
her
,
and
run
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
explanation
will
do
for
another
time
,
"
think
I.
<EOS>
still
,
when
I
reach
my
chamber
,
I
feel
a
pang
at
the
idea
she
should
even
temporarily
misconstrue
what
she
have
see
.
<EOS>
but
joy
soon
efface
every
other
feeling
;
and
loud
as
the
wind
blow
,
near
and
deep
as
the
thunder
crash
,
fierce
and
frequent
as
the
lightning
gleam
,
cataract
-
like
as
the
rain
fall
during
a
storm
of
two
hour
'
duration
,
I
experience
no
fear
and
little
awe
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
come
thrice
to
my
door
in
the
course
of
it
,
to
ask
if
I
be
safe
and
tranquil
:
and
that
be
comfort
<EOS>
,
that
be
strength
for
anything
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
leave
my
bed
in
the
morning
,
little
Adele
come
run
in
to
tell
me
that
the
great
horse
-
chestnut
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
have
be
strike
by
lightne
in
the
night
,
and
half
of
it
split
away
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
rise
and
dress
,
I
think
over
what
have
happen
,
and
wonder
if
it
be
a
dream
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
certain
of
the
reality
till
I
have
see
Mr.
Rochester
again
,
and
hear
him
renew
his
word
of
love
and
promise
.
  
<EOS>
while
arrange
my
hair
,
I
look
at
my
face
in
the
glass
,
and
feel
it
be
no
longer
plain
:
there
be
hope
in
its
aspect
and
life
in
its
colour
;
and
my
eye
seem
as
if
they
have
behold
the
fount
of
fruition
,
and
borrow
beam
from
the
lustrous
ripple
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
be
unwilling
to
look
at
my
master
,
because
I
fear
he
could
not
be
pleased
at
my
look
;
but
I
be
sure
I
may
lift
my
face
to
his
now
,
and
not
cool
his
affection
by
its
expression
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
plain
but
clean
and
light
summer
dress
from
my
drawer
and
put
it
on
:
it
seem
no
attire
have
ever
so
well
become
me
,
because
none
have
I
ever
wear
in
so
blissful
a
mood
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
surprised
,
when
I
run
down
into
the
hall
,
to
see
that
a
brilliant
June
morning
have
succeed
to
the
temp
of
the
night
;
and
to
feel
,
through
the
open
glass
door
,
the
breathing
of
a
fresh
and
fragrant
breeze
.
<EOS>
nature
must
be
gladsome
when
I
be
so
happy
.
<EOS>
a
beggar
-
woman
and
her
little
boy
 
pale
,
ragged
object
<EOS>
both
 
be
come
up
the
walk
,
and
I
run
down
and
give
them
all
the
money
I
happen
to
have
in
my
purse
 
<EOS>
some
three
or
four
shilling
:
good
or
bad
,
they
must
partake
of
my
jubilee
.
<EOS>
the
rook
caw
,
and
blither
bird
sing
;
but
nothing
be
so
merry
or
so
musical
as
my
own
rejoice
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
surprise
me
by
look
out
of
the
window
with
a
sad
countenance
,
and
say
gravely
 
"
Miss
Eyre
,
will
you
come
to
breakfast
?
"
<EOS>
during
the
meal
she
be
quiet
and
cool
:
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
undeceive
her
then
.
<EOS>
I
must
wait
for
my
master
to
give
explanation
;
and
so
must
she
.
<EOS>
I
eat
what
I
could
,
and
then
I
hasten
upstairs
.
<EOS>
I
meet
Adele
leave
the
schoolroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go

<EOS>
It
be
time
for

<EOS>
"
Mr.

<EOS>
"
come

bid
me
good

morning

"
say
he
.
<EOS>
I
gladly
advance
;
and
it
be
not
merely
a
cold
word
now
,
or
even
a
shake
of
the
hand
that
I
receive
,
but
an
embrace
and
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
It
seem
natural
:
it
seem
genial
to
be
so
well
love
,
so
caress
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
you

I
do

I
could
not
quite

it

:
it
make
me
giddy

<EOS>
the
feeling
,
the
announcement
send
through
me

be
something
strong

be
consistent

joy

something

smote

now
you

what

<EOS>

I

myself
put

you

You

Hush
,
sir

<EOS>
You
do
not

very
wisely
just
now

any
more

very
wisely

<EOS>
however

have
they

they

no

by
their
severity
as
husband
have
make
up
for
their
softness
as
suitor
;
and
so
will
you
,
I
fear
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
you
will
answer
me
a
year
hence
,
should
I
ask
a
favour
<EOS>
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

ask
me
something
now

Jane

the
least
thing
:
<EOS>
I
desire
to

entreat

"
indeed
I
will
,

I
have
my
petition
all
ready

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

speak
!
<EOS>
but
if
you
look
up
and
smile
with
that
countenance
,
I
shall
swear
concession
before
I
know
to
what

and
that
will
make
a
fool
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all

sir

I
ask
only
this
:
do
not
send
for
the
jewel
,
and
do
not
crown
me
with
rose
:
<EOS>
you
may
as
well
put
a
border
of
gold
lace
<EOS>
round
that
plain
pocket
handkerchief
you
have
there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

refined
gold

your

for

<EOS>
I
will
remand
the

I
despatch
to
my

<EOS>
but
you
have
not

for
anything

you

pray
a
gift
to
be
withdraw
:
try
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

have
the

He

what

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
"
he

hastily

<EOS>

curiosity

there
can

this
,

"
  
<EOS>
"
utter
it
,
Jane
:
<EOS>
but
I
wish
that
instead
of
a

inquiry
into

perhaps
,
a
secret

now

usurer

seek
good
investment

I

all

You

You

You

sulky

You

Your

become

out

there

you

rudeness

I

rather

this

down

you

spirit
you
can

You
glow

"
  
<EOS>

well

I

you

soon
dress
;

when

quit
Mrs.

parlour

I
hurry
down
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
old
lady
,
have
be
read
her
morning
portion
of
scripture
 
the
lesson
for
the
day
;
her
Bible
lie
open
before

spectacle
be
upon
it

<EOS>
Her
occupation

suspend
by
Mr.

announcement

seem
now
forget

her
eye

fix
on

stir
by
unwonted
tiding

rouse
herself
:
she
make
a
sort

effort

smile
,

frame
a

word

congratulation

but
the
smile
expire
,

the
sentence
be
abandon
unfinished

She
put
up
her
spectacle
,
shut
the
Bible
,

push
her
chair
back
from
the
table

I

so
astonished

I
hardly
know
what
to

have
surely
not

have
I
?

sometimes
I
half
fall
asleep
when
I
be
sit
alone

fancy
thing
that
have
never

<EOS>
It
have
seem
to
me
more
than
once
when
I
have
be
in
a
doze
,
that
my
dear
husband

who
die
fifteen
year
since

have
come
in
and
sit
down
beside
me

that
I
have
even
hear
him
call
me

use

can

actually
true

have
ask
you
to
marry
him

<EOS>
do
not
laugh
at
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
really
think
he
come
in
here
five
minute
ago
,
and
say
that
in
a
month
you
would
be
his
wife

He
have
say
the

never

be
a
proud
man

all

Rochesters
be
proud

and
his

at

like
money

He

too

have
always

call
careful

She
survey
my

I
read

that

there
find
no
charm
powerful
enough
to
solve
the
enigma

<EOS>
"
It
pass
me

<EOS>
she
continue
;
"
but
no
doubt

it
be
true

you
say
so

<EOS>
how
it
will
answer
,
I
can
not
tell
:
I
really
do
not
know

<EOS>
equality
of
position
and
fortune
be
often
advisable
in
such
case

there
be
twenty
year
of
difference
in
your
age

He
may
almost
be
your
father

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

indeed

Mrs.
Fairfax
!

exclaim

nettle

nothing

no

who
see
us
together

would
suppose
it

an
instant

Mr.
Rochester
look
as
young

as
young

as
some
man
at
five
-

twenty

be
it
really

be
go
to

<EOS>
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
hurt
by
her
coldness

scepticism

that
the
tear
rise
to
my
eye

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
grieve
you

pursue
the
widow

but
you
be
so
young
,

so
little
acquaint
with
man

I
wish
to
put
you
on
your
guard

<EOS>
It
be
an
old
saying
that
"
all
be
not
gold
that
glitter
;
"
and
<EOS>
in
this
case
I
do
fear
there
will
be
something
find
to
be
different
to
what
either
you
or
I
expect
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
a
monster
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
:
"
be
it
impossible
that
Mr.
Rochester
should
have
a
sincere
affection
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
:
you
be
very
well
;
and
much
improve
of
late
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
daresay
,
be
fond
of
you

<EOS>
I
have
always
notice
that
you
be
a
sort

pet
of
his

there
be
time
when
,
for
your
sake
,
I
have
be
a
little
uneasy
at
his
marked
preference
,

have
wish
to
put
you
on
your
guard

but
I
do
not
like
to
suggest
even
the
possibility
of
wrong

<EOS>
I
know
such
an
idea
would
shock
,
perhaps
offend
you

you
be
so
discreet

so
thoroughly
modest

sensible

I
hope
you
may
be
trust
to
protect
yourself

<EOS>
last
night
I
can
not
tell
you
what
I
suffer
when
I
seek
all
over
the
house
,
and
could
find
you
nowhere
,
nor
the
master
either
;
and
then
,
at
twelve
o'clock
,
see
you
come
in
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
never
mind
that
now

I
interrupt
impatiently

it
be
enough

you
can
not

He

quite
peremptory

both
in
look
and
voice

<EOS>
the
chill
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
warning
,

the
damp
of
her
doubt
be
upon
me

<EOS>
something
of
unsubstantiality

uncertainty
have
beset
my
hope

<EOS>
I
half
lose
the
sense
of
power
over
him

<EOS>
I
be
about
mechanically
to

him

without

her
gratitude
for
my

she
be
instantly
stow
away
into
a
corner
on
the
other
side

him

<EOS>
She
then
peep
round
to
where
I
sit
;
so
stern
a
neighbour
be
too
restrictive
to
him
,
in
his
present
fractious
mood
,
she
dare
whisper
no
observation

nor
ask
of
him
any
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
her
come
to
me
,

I
entreat
:
"
she
will
,
perhaps
,
trouble
you

there
be
plenty
of
room

side

<EOS>
He

her
over
as

be
a
lapdog

Adele

him

to
go
to
school

san
mademoiselle

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

he

"
absolutely

mademoiselle

I
be
to
take
mademoiselle
to
the
moon

there
I

seek
a
cave

white
valley

me

She

you
will
starve
her

"
observe
Adele
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
gather
manna
for
her
morning

night

the
plains

with
manna

Adele

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

She
will
want
to
warm
herself

what
will
she

for
a
fire
?

fire
rise
out
of
the
lunar
mountain

when
she
be
cold

I
will
carry
her
up
to
a
peak

lie
her
down
on
the
edge
of
a
crater

wear
out

how
can
she
get
new
one

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

profess
to
be
puzzle

"
<EOS>
hem
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
do
,
Adele
?
<EOS>
Cudgel
your
brain
for
an
expedient
.
<EOS>
how
would
a
white
or
a
pink
cloud
answer
for
a
gown
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
and
one
could
cut
a
pretty
enough
scarf
out
of
a
rainbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
far
well
as
she
be
,
"
conclude
Adele
,
after
muse
some
time
:
"
besides
,
she
would
get
tired
of
live
with
only
you
in
the
moon
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
mademoiselle
,
I
would
never
consent
to
go
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
consent
:
she
have
pledge
her
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
can
not
get
her
there
;
there
be
no
road
to
the
moon
<EOS>
:
it
be
all
air
;
and
neither
you
nor
she
can
fly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adele
,
look
at
that
field
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
now
outside
Thornfield
gate
,
and
bowling
lightly
along
the
smooth
road
to
Millcote
,
where
the
dust
be
well
lay
by
the
thunderstorm
,
and
,
where
the
low
hedge
and
lofty
timber
tree
on
each
side
glisten
green
and
rain
-
refresh
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
that
field
,
Adele
,
I
be
walk
late
one
evening
about
a
fortnight
since
 
the
evening
of
the
day
<EOS>
you
help
me
to
make
hay
in
the
orchard
meadow
;
and
,
as
I
be
tired
with
rake
swath
,
I
sit
down
to
rest
me
on
a
stile
;
and
there
I
take
out
a
little
book
and
a
pencil
,
and
begin
to
write
about
a
misfortune
that
befall
me
long
ago
,
and
a
wish
I
have
for
happy
day
to
come
:
I
be
write
away
very
fast
,
though
daylight
be
fade
from
the
leaf
,
when
something
come
up
the
path
and
stop
two
yard
off
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
thing
with
a
veil
of
gossamer
on
its
head
.
<EOS>
I
beckon
it
to
come
near
me
;
it
stand
soon
at
my
knee
.
<EOS>
I
never
speak
to
it
,
and
it
never
speak
to
me
,
in
word
;
but
I
read
its
eye
,
and
it
read
mine
;
and
our
speechless
colloquy
be
to
this
effect
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
fairy
,
and
come
from
elf
-
land
,
it
say
;
and
its
errand
be
to
make
me
happy
:
I
must
go
with
it
out
of
the
common
world
to
a
lonely
place
 
such
as
the
moon
,
for
instance
 
<EOS>
and
it
nod
its
head
towards
her
horn
,
rise
over
Hay
-
hill
<EOS>
:
it
tell
me
of
the
alabaster
cave
and
silver
vale
where
we
may
live
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
should
like
to
go
;
but
remind
it
,
as
you
do
me
,
that
I
have
no
wing
to
fly
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
oh
,
"
return
the
fairy
,
"
that
do
not
signify
!
<EOS>
here
be
a
talisman
will
remove
all
difficulty
;
"
and
she
hold
out
a
pretty
gold
ring
.
<EOS>
"
put
it
,
"
she
say
,
"
on
the
fourth
finger
of
my
left
hand
,
and
I
be
yours
,
and
you
be
mine
;
and
we
shall
leave
earth
,
and
make
our
own
heaven
yonder
.
"
<EOS>
She
nod
again
at
the
moon
.
<EOS>
the
ring
,
Adele
,
be
in
my
breech
-
pocket
,
under
the
disguise
of
a
sovereign
:
but
I
mean
soon
to
change
it
to
a
ring
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
have
mademoiselle
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
the
fairy
<EOS>
:
you
say
it
be
mademoiselle
you
would
take
to
the
moon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
be
a
fairy
,
"
he
say
,
whisper
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
tell
her
not
to
mind
his
badinage
;
and
she
,
on
her
part
,
evince
a
fund
of
genuine
french
scepticism
:
denominate
Mr.
Rochester
"
un
vrai
menteur
,
"
and
assure
him
that
she
make
no
account
whatever
of
his
"
contes
de
fee
,
"
and
that
"
du
reste
,
il
n'y
avait
pas
de
fees
,
et
quand
<EOS>
meme
il
y
<EOS>
en
<EOS>
avait
<EOS>
:
"
she
be
sure
they
would
never
appear
to
him
,
nor
ever
give
him
ring
,
or
offer
to
live
with
him
in
the
moon
.
  
<EOS>
the
hour
spend
at
Millcote
be
a
somewhat
harass
one
to
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
oblige
me
to
go
to
a
certain
silk
warehouse
:
there
I
be
order
to
choose
half
-
a
-
dozen
dress
.
<EOS>
I
hate
the
business
,
I
beg
leave
to
defer
it
:
no
 
it
should
be
go
through
with
now
.
<EOS>
by
dint
of
entreaty
express
in
energetic
whisper
,
I
reduce
the
half
-
dozen
to
two
:
these
however
,
he
vow
he
would
select
himself
.
<EOS>
with
anxiety
I
watch
his
eye
rove
over
the
gay
store
:
he
fix
on
a
rich
silk
of
the
most
brilliant
amethyst
dye
,
and
a
superb
pink
satin
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
in
a
new
series
of
whisper
,
that
he
may
as
well
buy
me
a
gold
gown
and
a
silver
bonnet
at
once
<EOS>
:
I
should
certainly
never
venture
to
wear
his
choice
.
<EOS>
with
infinite
difficulty
,
for
he
be
stubborn
as
a
stone
,
I
persuade
him
to
make
an
exchange
in
favour
of
a
sober
black
satin
and
pearl
-
grey
silk
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
pass
for
the
present
,
"
he
say
;
"
but
he
would
yet
see
me
glitter
like
a
parterre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Glad
be
I
to
get
him
out
of
the
silk
warehouse
,
and
then
out
of
a
jeweller
shop
:
the
more
he
buy
me
,
the
more
my
cheek
burn
with
a
sense
of
annoyance
and
degradation
.
<EOS>
as
we
re
-
enter
the
carriage
,
and
I
sit
back
feverish
and
fag
<EOS>
,
I
remember
what
,
in
the
hurry
of
event
,
dark
and
bright
,
I
have
wholly
forget
 
the
letter
of
my
uncle
,
John
Eyre
,
to
Mrs.
Reed
:
his
intention
to
adopt
me
and
make
me
his
legatee
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
,
indeed
,
be
a
relief
,
"
I
think
,
"
if
I
have
ever
so
small
an
independency
;
I
never
can
bear
be
dress
like
a
doll
by
Mr.
Rochester
,
or
sit
like
a
second
Danae
with
the
golden
shower
fall
daily
round
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
to
Madeira
the
moment
I
get
home
,
and
tell
my
uncle
John
I
be
go
to
be
married
,
and
to
whom
:
if
I
have
but
a
prospect
of
one
day
bring
Mr.
Rochester
an
accession
of
fortune
,
I
could
better
endure
to
be
keep
by
him
now
.
"
<EOS>
and
somewhat
relieved
by
this
idea
(
which
I
fail
not
to
execute
that
day
)
,
I
venture
once
more
to
meet
my
master
's
and
lover
's
eye
,
which
most
pertinaciously
seek
mine
,
though
I
avert
both
face
and
gaze
.
<EOS>
He
smile
;
and
I
think
his
smile
be
such
as
a
sultan
might
,
in
a
blissful
and
fond
moment
,
bestow
on
a
slave
his
gold
and
gem
have
enrich
<EOS>
:
I
crush
his
hand
,
which
be
ever
hunt
mine
,
vigorously
,
and
thrust
it
back
to
him
red
with
the
passionate
pressure
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
look
in
that
way
,
"
I
say
;
"
if
you
do
,
I
will
wear
nothing
<EOS>
but
my
old
Lowood
frock
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
marry
in
this
lilac
<EOS>
gingham
<EOS>
:
you
may
make
a
dressing
-
gown
for
yourself
out
of
the
pearl
-
grey
silk
,
and
an
infinite
series
of
waistcoat
out
of
the
black
satin
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
chuckle
;
he
rub
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
rich
to
see
and
hear
her
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
be
she
original
?
<EOS>
be
she
piquant
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
exchange
this
one
little
english
girl
for

Grand
Turk

whole
seraglio

eye

the
eastern
allusion
bite
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
stand
you
an
inch
in
the
stead
of
a
seraglio
,

I
say
;

so
do
not
consider
me
an
equivalent

one

a
fancy
for

line

away

for

me
to
go
through

marriage
ceremony

that
perform
at

You
will
stipulate

,
for
peculiar
term
 
<EOS>
what

they
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
want
an
easy
mind
,
sir
;
not
crush
by
crowded
obligation

<EOS>
do
you
remember
what
you
say
of
Celine
Varens
?
 
of
the
diamond
,
the
cashmere
you
give
her
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
your
English
Celine
Varens

<EOS>
I
shall
continue
to
act
as
Adele
's
governess
;
by
that
I
shall
earn
my
board
and
lodging
,
and
thirty
pound
a
year
besides

<EOS>
I
will
furnish
my

wardrobe
out
of

you
shall
give
me
nothing

"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
regard
;

if
I
give
you
mine
in

that

will
be
quit

well

for

innate
pride

<EOS>
We

Thornfield

Will
it

you

dine
with

come
then

<EOS>
"
I
want
a
smoke

Jane

a
pinch
of
snuff
,
to
comfort
me
under
all
this

"
pour
me

would

unfortunately
I
have
neither

box

listen
 
whisper

<EOS>
It

your

now

little

it

be
mine
presently
;

when
once
I
have
fairly
seize
you

to
have

hold
,
I
will
just
 
figuratively
speak
 
attach
you

He
say
this
as
he
help
me
to
alight
from
the
carriage
,
and
while
he
afterwards
lift
out
Adele
,
I
enter
the
house
,
and
make
good
my
retreat
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
He
duly
summon
me
to
his
presence
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
have
prepare
an
occupation
for
him
;
for
I
be
determine
not
to
spend
the
whole
time
in
a
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
remember
his
fine
voice
;
I
know
he
like
to
sing
 
good
singer
generally
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
vocalist
myself
,
and
,
in
his
fastidious
judgment
,
no
musician
,
either
;
but
I
delight
in
listen
when
the
performance
be
good
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
twilight
,
that
hour
of
romance
,
begin
to
lower
her
blue
and
starry
banner
over
the
lattice
,
than
I
rise
,
open
the
piano
,
and
entreat
him
,
for
the
love
of
heaven
,
to
give
me
a
song
.
<EOS>
He
say
I
be
a
capricious
witch
,
and
that
he
would
rather
sing
another
time
;
but
I
aver
that
no
time
be
like
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
like
his
voice
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
fond
of
pamper
that
susceptible
vanity
of
his
;
but
for
once
,
and
from
motive
of
expediency
,
I
would
e'en
soothe
and
stimulate
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Jane
,
you
must
play
the
accompaniment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
sir
,
I
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
try
,
but
be
presently
sweep
off
the
stool
and
denominate
"
a
little
bungler
.
<EOS>
"
be
push
unceremoniously
to
one
side
 
which
be
precisely
what
I
wish
 
<EOS>
he
usurp
my
place
,
and
proceed
to
accompany
himself
:
for
he
could
play
as
well
as
sing
.
<EOS>
I
hie
me
to
the
window
-
recess
.
<EOS>
and
while
I
sit
there
and
look
out
on
the
still
tree
and
dim
lawn
,
to
a
sweet
air
be
sing
in
mellow
tone
the
following
strain
:
    
"
<EOS>
the
true
love
that

heart
Felt
at
its

core

through

vein

the
tide

be

Her
coming
be
my

each
day

Her
parting
be
my
pain

the
chance

step
delay

ice
in
every
vein

<EOS>
I
dream
it
would
be
nameless
bliss
,
as
I
love
,
love
to
be
;
and
to
this
object
do
I
press
as
blind
as
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
but
wide
as
pathless
be
the
space
that
lie
our
life
between
,
and
dangerous
as
the
foamy
race
of
ocean

surge
green

haunt
as

path

for
Might

Woe
and
Wrath

between
our
spirit
stand

<EOS>
I
danger
dare
;
I
hindrance
scorn
;
I
omen
do
defy
<EOS>
:
whatever
menaced

harass

I
pass
impetuous
by

<EOS>
on
speed
my
rainbow

fast

I
fly
as

for
glorious
rise
upon
my
sight

that
child
of
Shower
and
Gleam

<EOS>
still
bright
on
cloud

dim

that
soft
,
solemn
joy
;
nor

I
now
,
how
dense
and
grim
disaster
gather
nigh
.
  
<EOS>
I
care
not
in
this
moment
sweet
,
<EOS>
though
all
I
have
rush
o'er
Should
come
on
pinion
,
strong
and
fleet
,
proclaiming
vengeance
sore
:

though
haughty
Hate
should

me
down

me

Might

endless

entwine

<EOS>
He
rise
and
come
towards
me
,
and
I
see
his
face
all
kindle
,
and
his
full
falcon
-
eye
flashing
,
and
tenderness
and
passion
in
every
lineament
.
<EOS>
I
quail
momentarily
 
then
I
rally
.
<EOS>
soft
scene
,
dare
demonstration
,
I
would
not
have
;
and
I
stand
in
peril
of
both
:
<EOS>
a
weapon
of
defence
must
be
prepare
 
<EOS>
I
whet
my
tongue
:
as
he
reach
me
,
I
ask
with
asperity
,
"
whom
he
be
go
to
marry
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
strange
question
to
be
put
by
his
darle
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
consider
it
a
very
natural
and
necessary
one
:
he
have
talk
of
his
future
wife
die
with
him
.
<EOS>
what
do
he
mean
by
such
a
pagan
idea
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
have
no
intention
of
die
with
him
 
he
may
depend
on
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
all
he
long
,
all
he
pray
for

be
that
I
may
live
with
him
!
<EOS>
death
be
not
for
such
as
i.
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
:
<EOS>
I
have
as
good
a
right
to
die
when
my
time
come
as
he
have
:
<EOS>
but
I
should
bide
that
time
,
and
not
be
hurry
away
in
a
suttee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
I
forgive
him
for
the
selfish
idea
,
and
prove
my
pardon
by
a
reconcile
kiss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
:
I
would
rather
be
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
I
hear
myself
apostrophise
as
a
"
hard
little
thing
;
"
and
it
be
add
,
"
any
other
woman
would
have
be
melt
to
marrow
at
hear
such
stanza
croon
in
her
praise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
assure
him
I
be
naturally
hard
 
very
flinty
,
and
that
he
would
often
find
me
so
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
I
be
determined
to
show
him
diver
rugged
point
in
my
character
before
the
ensue
four
week
elapse
:
he
should
know
fully
what
sort
of
a
bargain
he
have
make
,
while
there
be
yet
time
to
rescind
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
I
be
quiet
and
talk
rationally
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
be
quiet
if
he
like
,
and
as
to
talk
rationally
,
I
flatter
myself
I
be
do
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
fret
,
pishe
,
and
pshawe
.
"
<EOS>
very
good
,
"
I
think
;
"
you
may
fume
and
fidget
as
you
please
:
but
this
be
the
good
plan
to
pursue
with
you
<EOS>
,
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
I
like
you
more
than
I
can
say
;
but
I
will
not
sink
into
a
bathos
of
sentiment
:
and
with
this
needle
of
repartee
I
will
keep
you
from
the
edge
of
the
gulf
too
;
and
,
moreover
,
maintain
by
its
pungent
aid
that
distance
between
you
and
myself
most
conducive
to
our
real
mutual
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
from
less
to
more
,
I
work
him
up
to
considerable
irritation
;
then
,
after
he
have
retire
,
in
dudgeon
,
quite
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
I
get
up
,
and
say
,
"
I
wish
you
good
-
night
,
sir
,
"
in
my
natural
and
wonte
respectful
manner
,
I
slip
out
by
the
side
-
door
and
get
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
system
thus
enter
on
,
I
pursue
during
the
whole
season
of
probation
;
and
with
the
good
success
.
<EOS>
He
be
keep
,
to
be
sure
,
rather
cross
and
crusty
;
but
on
the
whole
I
could
see
he
be
excellently
entertain
,
and
that
a
lamb
-
like
submission
and
turtle
-
dove
sensibility
,
while
foster
his
despotism
more
,
would
have
please
his
judgment
,
satisfy
his
common
-
sense
,
and
even
suit
his
taste
less
.
  
<EOS>
in
other
people
's
presence
I
be
,
as
formerly
,
deferential
and
quiet
;
any
other
line
of
conduct
be
uncalled
for
:
it
be
only
in
the
evening
conference
I
thus
thwart
and
afflict
him
.
<EOS>
He
continue
to
send
for
me
punctually
the
moment
the
clock
strike
seven
;
though
when
I
appear
before
him
now
,
he
have
no
such
honeyed
term
as
"
love
"
and
"
darling
"
on
his
lip
:
the
good
word
at
my
service
be
"
provoking
puppet
,
"
"
malicious
elf
,
"
"
sprite
,
"
"
changele
,
"
&
c.
<EOS>
for
caress
,
too
,
I
now
get
grimace
;
for
a
pressure
of
the
hand
,
a
pinch
on
the
arm
;
for
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
,
a
severe
tweak
of
the
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
right
:
at
present
I
decidedly
prefer
these
fierce
favour
to
anything
more
tender
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
I
see
,
approve
me
:
her
anxiety
on
my
account
vanish
;
therefore
I
be
certain
I
do
well
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
Mr.
Rochester
affirm
I
be
wear
him
to
skin
and
bone
,
and
threaten
awful
vengeance
for
my
present
conduct
at
some
period
fast
come
.
<EOS>
I
laugh
in
my
sleeve
at
his
menace
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
keep
you
in
reasonable
check
now
,
"
I
reflect
;
"
and
I
do
not
doubt
to
be
able
to
do
it
hereafter
:
if
one
expedient
lose
its
virtue
,
another
must
be
devise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
yet
after
all
my
task
be
not
an
easy
one
;
often
I
would
rather
have
please
than
tease
him
.
<EOS>
My
future
husband
be
become
to
me
my
whole
world
;
and
more
than
the
world
:
almost
my
hope
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
He
stand
between
me
and
every
thought
of
religion
,
as
an
eclipse
intervene
between
man
and
the
broad
sun
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
in
those
day
,
see
God
for
His
creature
:
of
whom
I
have
make
an
idol
.
    
<EOS>
the
month
of
courtship
have
waste
:
its
very
last
hour
be
be
number
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
put
off
the
day
that
advance
 
the
bridal
day
;
and
all
preparation
for
its
arrival
be
complete
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
,
at
least
,
have
nothing
more
to
do
:
there
be
my
trunk
,
pack
,
lock
,
corded
,
range
in
a
row
along
the
wall
of
my
little
chamber
;
to

morrow
,
at
this
time
,
they
would
be
far
on
their
road
to
London
:
<EOS>
and
so
should
<EOS>
I
(
D.V.
)
,
 
or
rather
,
not
I
,
but
one
Jane
Rochester
,
a
person
whom
<EOS>
as
<EOS>
yet
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
the
card
of
address
alone
remain
to
nail
on
:
they
lay
,
four
little
square
,
in
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
have
himself
write
the
direction
,
"
Mrs.
Rochester

Hotel
,
London

on
each

I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
affix
them
,
or
to
have
them
affix
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rochester
!
<EOS>
She
do
not
exist

she
would
not
be

till
to

some
time
after
eight
o'clock
a.m.
;
and
I
would
wait
to
be
assure
she
have
come
into
the
world
alive
before
I
assign
to
her
all
that
property
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
that
in
yonder
closet
,
opposite
my
dressing
-
table
,
garment
say
to
be
her
have
already
displace
my
black
stuff
<EOS>
Lowood
frock
and
straw
bonnet
:
for
not
to
me
appertain
that
suit
of
wedding
raiment
;
the
pearl
-
colour
robe
,
the
vapoury
veil
pendent
from
the
usurped
portmanteau
.
<EOS>
I
shut
the
closet
to
conceal
the
strange
,
wraith
-
like
apparel
it
contain
;
which
,
at
this
evening
hour
 
nine
o'clock
 
give
out
certainly
a
most
ghostly
shimmer
through
the
shadow
of
my
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
leave
you
by
yourself
,
white
dream
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
feverish
:
I
hear
the
wind
blow
:
I
will
go
out
of
door
and
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
the
hurry
of
preparation
that
make
me
feverish
;
not
only
the
anticipation
of
the
great
change
 
the
new
life
which
be
to
commence
to
-
morrow
:
both
these
circumstance
have
their
share
,
doubtless
,
in
produce
that
restless
,
excited
mood
which
hurry
me
forth
at
this
late
hour
into
the
darkening
ground
:
but
a
third
cause
influence
my
mind
more
than
they
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
at
heart
a
strange
and
anxious
thought
.
<EOS>
something
have
happen
which
I
could
not
comprehend
;
no
one
know
of
or
have
see
the
event
but
myself
:
it
have
take
place
the
precede
night
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
that
night
be
absent
from
home
;
nor
be
he
yet
return
:
business
have
call
him
to
a
small
estate
of
two
or
three
farm
he
possess
thirty
mile
off
 
business
<EOS>
it
be
requisite
he
should
settle
in
person
,
previous
to
his
meditate
departure
from
England
.
<EOS>
I
wait
now
his
return
;
eager
to
disburthen
my
mind
,
and
to
seek
of
him
the
solution
of
the
enigma
that
perplex
me
.
<EOS>
stay
till
he
come
,
reader
;
and
,
when
I
disclose
my
secret
to
him
,
you
shall
share
the
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
I
seek
the
orchard
,
drive
to
its
shelter
by
the
wind
,
which
all
day
have
blow
strong
and
full
from
the
south
,
without
,
however
,
bring
a
speck
of
rain
.
<EOS>
instead
of
subside
as
night
draw
on
,
it
seem
to
augment
its
rush
and
deepen
its
roar
:
the
tree
blow
steadfastly
one
way
,
never
writhe
round
,
and
scarcely
toss
back
their
bough
once
in
an
hour
;
so
continuous
be
the
strain
bend
their
branchy
head
northward
 
<EOS>
the
cloud
drift
from
pole
to
pole
,
fast
following
,
mass
on
mass
:
<EOS>
no
glimpse
of
blue
sky
have
be
visible
that
July
day
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
a
certain
wild
pleasure
<EOS>
I
run
before
the
wind
,
deliver
my
trouble
of
mind
to
the
measureless
air
-
torrent
thunder
through
space
.
<EOS>
descend
the
laurel
walk
,
I
face
the
wreck
of
the
chestnut
-
tree
;
it
stand
up
black
and
rive
:
<EOS>
the
trunk
,
split
down
the
centre
,
gasp
ghastly
.
<EOS>
the
cloven
half
be
not
break
from
each
other
,
for
the
firm
base
and
strong
root
keep
them
unsundered
below
;
though
community
of
vitality
be
destroy
 
<EOS>
the
sap
could
flow
no
more
:
their
great
bough
on
each
side
be
dead
,
and
next
winter
's
tempest
would
be
sure
to
fell
one
or
both
to
earth
:
as
yet
,
however
,
they
may
be
say
to
form
one
tree
 
a
ruin
,
but
an
entire
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
right
to
hold
fast
to
each
other
,
"
I
say
:
as
if
the
monster-
splinter
be
live
thing
,
and
could
hear
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
scathe
as
you
look
,
and
char
and
scorch
,
there
must
be
a
little
sense
of
life
in
you
yet
,
rise
out
of
that
adhesion
at
the
faithful
,
honest
root
:
you
will
never
have
green
leave
<EOS>
more
 
never
more
see
bird
make
nest
and
singe
idyls
in
your
bough
;
the
time
of
pleasure
and
love
be
over
with
you
:
but
you
be
not
desolate
:
<EOS>
each
of
you
have
a
comrade
to
sympathise
with
him
in
his
decay
.
<EOS>
"
as
I
look
up
at
them
,
the
moon
appear
momentarily
in
that
part
of
the
sky
which
fill
their
fissure
;
her
disk
be
blood
-
red
and
half
overcast
;
she
seem
to
throw
on
me
one
bewildered
,
dreary
glance
,
and
bury
herself
again
instantly
in
the
deep
drift
of
cloud
.
<EOS>
the
wind
fall
,
for
a
second
,
round
Thornfield
;
but
far
away
over
wood
and
water
,
pour
a
wild
,
melancholy
wail
<EOS>
:
it
be
sad
to
listen
to
,
and
I
run
off
again
.
  
<EOS>
here
<EOS>
and
there
I
stray
through
the
orchard
,
gather
up
the
apple
with
which
the
grass
round
the
tree
root
be
thickly
strew
;
then
I
employ
myself
in
divide
the
ripe
from
the
unripe
;
I
carry
them
into
the
house
and
put
them
away
in
the
store
-
room
.
<EOS>
then
I
repair
to
the
library
to
ascertain
whether
the
fire
be
light
,
for
,
though
summer
,
I
know
on
such
a
gloomy
evening
Mr.
Rochester
would
like
to
see
a
cheerful
hearth
when
he
come
in
:
<EOS>
yes
,
the
fire
have
be
kindle
some
time
,
and
burn
well
.
<EOS>
I
place
his
arm
-
chair
by
the
chimney
-
corner
:
<EOS>
I
wheel
the
table
near
it
:
I
let
down
the
curtain
,
and
have
the
candle
bring
in
ready
for
lighting
.
<EOS>
more
restless
than
ever
,
when
I
have
complete
these
arrangement
I
could
not
sit
still
,
nor
even
remain
in
the
house
:
a
little
time
-
piece
in
the
room
and
the
old
clock
in
the
hall
simultaneously
strike
ten
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
late
it
grow
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
run
down
to
the
gate
:
it
be
moonlight
at
interval
;
I
can
see
a
good
way
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
come
now
,
and
to
meet
him
will
save
some
minute
of
suspense
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
wind
roar
high
in
the
great
tree
which
embower
the
gate
;
but
the
road
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
to
the
right
hand
and
the
left
,
be
all
still
and
solitary
:
save
for
the
shadow
of
cloud
cross
it
at
interval
as
the
moon
look
out
,
it
be
but
a
long
pale
line
,
unvarie
by
one
move
speck
.
  
<EOS>
a
puerile
tear
dim
my
eye
while
I
look
 
a
tear
of
disappointment
and
impatience
;
ashamed
of
it
,
I
wipe
it
away
.
<EOS>
I
linger
;
the
moon
shut
herself
wholly
within
her
chamber
,
and
draw
close
her
curtain
of
dense
cloud
:
the
night
grow
dark
;
rain
come
drive
fast
on
the
gale
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
would
come
!
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
come
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
,
seize
with
hypochondriac
forebode
.
<EOS>
I
have
expect
his
arrival
before
tea
;
now
it
be
dark
:
what
could
keep
him
?
<EOS>
have
an
accident
happen
?
<EOS>
the
event
of
last
night
again
recur
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
interpret
it
as
a
warning
of
disaster
.
<EOS>
I
fear
my
hope
be
too
bright
to
be
realise
;
and
I
have
enjoy
so
much
bliss
lately
<EOS>
that
I
imagine
my
fortune
have
pass
its
meridian
,
and
must
now
decline
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
can
not
return
to
the
house
,
"
I
think
;
"
I
can
not
sit
by
the
fireside
,
while
he
be
abroad
in
inclement
weather
:
well
tire
my
limb
than
strain
my
heart
;
I
will
go
forward
and
meet
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
set
out
;
I
walk
fast
,
but
not
far
:
ere
I
have
measure
a
quarter
of
a
mile
<EOS>
,
I
hear
the
tramp
of
hoofs
;
a
horseman
come
on
,
full
gallop
;
a
dog
run
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
away
with
evil
presentiment
!
<EOS>
It
be
he
:
here
he
be
,
mount
on
Mesrour
,
follow
by
pilot
.
<EOS>
He
see
me
;
for
the
moon
have
open
a
blue
field
in
the
sky
,
and
ride
in
it
watery
bright
:
he
take
his
hat
off
,
and
wave
it
round
his
head
.
<EOS>
I
now
run
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
!
"
he
exclaim
,
as
he
stretch
out
his
hand
and
bent
from
the
saddle
:
"
You
can
not
do
without
me
,
that
be
evident
.
<EOS>
step
on
my
boot
-
toe
;
give
me
both
hand
:
mount
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
obey
:
joy
make
me
agile
<EOS>
:
I
spring
up
before
him
.
<EOS>
a
hearty
kissing
I
get
for
a
welcome
,
and
some
boastful
triumph
,
which
I
swallow
as
well
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
He
check
himself
in
his
exultation
to
demand
,
"
but
be
there
anything
the
matter
,
Janet
,
that
you
come
to
meet
me
at
such
an
hour
?
<EOS>
be
there
anything
wrong
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
would
never
come
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
wait
in
the
house
for
you
,
especially
with
this
rain
and
wind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
rain
and
wind
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
yes
,
you
be
drip
like
a
mermaid
;
pull
my
cloak
round
you
:
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
be
feverish
,
Jane
:
both
your
cheek
and
hand
be
burn
hot
.
<EOS>
I
ask
again
,
be
there
anything
the
matter
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
nothing
now
;
I
be
neither
afraid
nor
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
be
both
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
rather
:
but
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it
by
-
and
-
bye
,
sir
;
and
I
daresay
you
will
only
laugh
at
me
for
my
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
laugh
at
you
heartily
when
to
-
morrow
be
past
;
till
then
I
dare
not
:
my
prize
be
not
certain
.
<EOS>
this
be
you
,
who
have
be
as
slippery
as
an
eel
this
last
month
,
and
as
thorny
as
a
briar
-
rise
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
lay
a
finger
anywhere
<EOS>
but
I
be
prick
;
and
now
I
seem
to
have
gather
up
a
stray
lamb
in
my
arm
.
<EOS>
You
wander
out
of
the
fold
to
seek
your
shepherd
,
do
you
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
:
but
do
not
boast
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
at
Thornfield
:
now
let
me
get
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
land
me
on
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
as
John
take
his
horse
,
and
he
follow
me
into
the
hall
,
he
tell
me
to
make
haste
and
put
something
dry
on
,
and
then
return
to
him
in
the
library
;
and
he
stop
me
,
as
I
make
for
the
staircase
,
to
extort
a
promise
that
I
would
not
be
long
:
nor
be
I
long
;
in
five
minute
I
rejoin
him
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
at
supper
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
a
seat
and
bear
me
company
,
Jane
:
please
God
,
it
be
the
last
meal
but
one
you
will
eat
at
Thornfield
Hall
for
a
long
time
.

"
  
<EOS>
I
sit
down
near
him
,
but
tell
him
I
could
not
eat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
it
because
you
have
the
prospect
of
a
journey
before
you

Jane

it
the
thought
of
go
to
London
that
take
away
your
appetite

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
my
prospect
clearly

night

sir

I
hardly
know
what
thought
I
have
in
my
head

everything

unreal

You

be
the
most
phantom

like
of
all

you
be
a
mere
dream

<EOS>
He
hold
out
his
hand
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
be
that
a
dream
?
"
say
he

place
it
close
to
my
eye

<EOS>
He
have
a
rounded

muscular

and
vigorous
hand

as
well
as
a
long

strong
arm

<EOS>
"
yes

I
touch
it

it

down

Sir

have
you
finish
supper

<EOS>

yes

away
the
tray

when

be
again
alone

stir
the
fire

take

I
do

look
up

to
read
the
sign
of
bliss
in
his

ardent

You

me

You

I
be
:
I
know
that

you
hint
a
while
ago
at
something
which
have
happen
in
my
absence
:
 
nothing
,
probably
,
of
consequence
;
but
,
in
short
,
it
have
disturb
you

<EOS>
let
me
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
say
something
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
or
you
have
overhear
the
servant
talk
?
 
<EOS>
your
sensitive
self

respect
have
be
wound
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

sir

<EOS>
"
It
strike
twelve
 
<EOS>
I
wait
<EOS>
till
the
time
-
piece
have
conclude
its
silver
chime

and
the
clock
its
hoarse
,
vibrate
stroke
,
and
then
I
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
day
yesterday
I
be
very
busy
,
and
very
happy
in
my
ceaseless
bustle
;
for
I
be
not
,
as
you
seem
to
think
,
trouble
by
any
haunting
fear
about
the
new
sphere
<EOS>
,
et
cetera
:
I
think
it
a
glorious
thing
to
have
the
hope
of
live
with
you
,
because
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
do
not
caress
me
now
 
<EOS>
let
me
talk
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
yesterday
I
trust
well
in
Providence
,
and
believe
that
event
be
work
together
for
your
good
and
mine
:
it
be
a
fine
day
,
if
you
recollect
 
the
calmness
of
the
air
and
sky
forbid
apprehension
respect
your
safety
or
comfort
on
your
journey
.
<EOS>
I
walk
a
little
while
on
the
pavement
after
tea
,
think
of
you
;
and
I
beheld
you
in
imagination
so
near
me
,
I
scarcely
miss
your
actual
presence
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
life
that
lie
before
me
 
_
<EOS>
your
_
life
,
sir
 
<EOS>
an
existence
more
expansive
and
stirring
than
my
own
:
as
much
more
so
as
the
depth
of
the
sea
to
which
the
brook
run
be
than
the
shallow
of
its
own
strait
channel
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
moralist
call
this
world
a
dreary
wilderness
:
for
me
it
blossom
like
a
rose
.
<EOS>
just
at
sunset
,
the
air
turn
cold
and
the
sky
cloudy
:
<EOS>
I
go
in
,
Sophie
call
me
upstairs
to
look
at
my
wedding
-
dress
,
which
they
have
just
bring
;
and
under
it
in
the
box
<EOS>
I
find
your
present
 
<EOS>
the
veil
which
,
in
your
princely
extravagance
,
you
send
for
from
London
:
resolve
,
I
suppose
,
since
I
would
not
have
jewel
,
to
cheat
me
into
accept
something
as
costly
.
<EOS>
I
smile
as
I
unfold
it
,
and
devise
how
I
would
tease
you
about
your
aristocratic
taste
,
and
your
effort
to
masque
your
plebeian
bride
in
the
attribute
of
a
peeress
.
<EOS>
I
think
how
I
would
carry
down
to
you
the
square
of
unembroidered
blond
I
have
myself
prepare
as
a
covering
for
my
low
-
bear
head
,
and
ask
if
that
be
not
good
enough
for
a
woman
who
could
bring
her
husband
neither
fortune
,
beauty
,
nor
connection
.
<EOS>
I
see
plainly
how
you
would
look
;
and
hear
your
impetuous
republican
answer
,
and
your
haughty
disavowal
of
any
necessity
on
your
part
to
augment
your
wealth
,
or
elevate
your
standing
,
by
marry
either
a
purse
or
a
coronet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
well
you
read
me
,
you
witch
!
"
<EOS>
interpose
Mr.
Rochester
:
"
but
what
do
you
find
in
the
veil
besides
its
embroidery
?
<EOS>
do
you
find
poison
,
or
a
dagger
,
that
you
look
so
mournful
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
sir
;
besides
the
delicacy
and
richness
of
the
fabric
,
I
find
nothing
save
Fairfax
Rochester
's
pride
;
and
that
do
not
scare
me
,
because
I
be
use
to
the
sight
of
the
demon
.
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
as
it
grow
dark
,
the
wind
rise
:
<EOS>
it
blow
yesterday
evening
,
not
as
it
blow
now
 
wild
and
high
 
but
"
with
a
sullen
,
moan
sound
"
far
more
eerie
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
come
into
this
room
,
and
the
sight
of
the
empty
chair
and
fireless
hearth
chill
me
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
after
I
go
to
bed
,
I
could
not
sleep
 
a
sense
of
anxious
excitement
distress
me
.
<EOS>
the
gale
still
rise
,
seem
to
my
ear
to
muffle
a
mournful
under
-
sound
;
whether
in
the
house
or
abroad
I
could
not
at
first
tell
,
but
it
recur
,
doubtful
yet
doleful
at
every
lull
;
at
last
I
make
out
it
must
be
some
dog
howl
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
when
it
cease
.
<EOS>
on
sleep
,
I
continue
in
dream
the
idea
of
a
dark
and
gusty
night
.
<EOS>
I
continue
also
the
wish
to
be
with
you
,
and
experience
a
strange
,
regretful
consciousness
of
some
barrier
divide
us
.
<EOS>
during
all
my
first
sleep
,
I
be
follow
the
winding
of
an
unknown
road
;
total
obscurity
environ
me
;
rain
pelt
me
;
I
be
burden
with
the
charge
of
a
little
child
:
a
very
small
creature
,
too
young
and
feeble
to
walk
,
and
which
shiver
in
my
cold
arm
,
and
wail
piteously
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
sir
,
that
you
be
on
the
road
a
long
way
before
me
;
and
I
strain
every
nerve
to
overtake
you
,
and
make
effort
on
effort
to
utter
your
name
and
entreat
you
to
stop
 
but
my
movement
be
fetter
,
and
my
voice
still
die
away
inarticulate
;
while
you
,
I
feel
,
withdraw
farther
and
farther
every
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
these
dream
weigh
on
your
spirit
now
,
Jane
,
when
I
be
close
to
you
?
<EOS>
little
nervous
subject
!
<EOS>
forget
visionary
woe
,
and
think
only
of
real
happiness
!
<EOS>
You
say
you
love
me
,
Janet
:
yes
 
I
will
not
forget
that
;
and
you
can
not
deny
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
those
_
word
do
not
die
inarticulate
on
your
lip
.
<EOS>
I
hear
them
clear
and
soft
:
a
thought
too
solemn
perhaps
,
but
sweet
as
music
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
a
glorious
thing
to
have
the
hope
of
live
with
you

Edward

I
love
you

it

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
with
my
whole
heart

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
say
,
after
some
minute
'
silence
,
"
it
be
strange
;
but
that
sentence
have
penetrate
my
breast
painfully
.
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
I
think
because
you
say
it
with
such
an
earnest
,
religious
energy
,
and
because
your
upward
gaze
at
me
now
be
the
very
sublime
of
faith
,
truth
,
and
devotion
:
it
be
too
much
as
if
some
spirit
be
near
me
.
<EOS>
look
wicked
,
Jane
:
as
you
know
well
how
to
look
:
coin
one
of
your
wild
,
shy
,
provoking
smile
;
tell
me
you
hate
me
 
<EOS>
tease
me
,
vex
me
;
do
anything
but
move
me
:
<EOS>
I
would
rather
be
incense
than
sadden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
tease
you
and
vex
you
to
your
heart
's
content
,
when
I
have
finish
my
tale
:
but
hear
me
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Jane
,
you
have
tell
me
all
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
find
the
source
of
your
melancholy
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
what
!
be
there
more
?
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
believe
it
to
be
anything
important
.
<EOS>
I
warn
you
of
incredulity
beforehand
.
<EOS>
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
disquietude
of
his
air
,
the
somewhat
apprehensive
impatience
of
his
manner
,
surprise
me
:
but
I
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dreamt
another
dream
,
sir
:
that
Thornfield
Hall
be
a
dreary
ruin
,
the
retreat
of
bat
and
owl
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
of
all
the
stately
front
nothing
remain
but
a
shell
-
like
wall
,
very
high
and
very
fragile
-
look
.
<EOS>
I
wander
,
on
a
moonlight
night
,
through
the
grass-
grow
enclosure
within
:
here
I
stumble
over
a
marble
hearth
,
and
there
over
a
fall
fragment
of
cornice
.
<EOS>
wrap
up
in
a
shawl
,
I
still
carry
the
unknown
little
child
:
I
may
not
lay
it
down
anywhere
,
however
tired
be
my
arm
 
however
much
its
weight
impede
my
progress
,
I
must
retain
it
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
gallop
of
a
horse
at
a
distance
on
the
road
;
I
be
sure
it
be
you
;
and
you
be
depart
for
many
year
and
for
a
distant
country
.
<EOS>
I
climb
the
thin
wall
with
frantic
perilous
haste
,
eager
to
catch
one
glimpse
of
you
from
the
top
:
the
stone
roll
from
under
my
foot
,
the
ivy
branch
I
grasp
give
way
,
the
child
cling
round
my
neck
in
terror
,
and
almost
strangle
me
;
at
last
I
gain
the
summit
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
like
a
speck
on
a
white
track
,
lessen
every
moment
.
<EOS>
the
blast
blow
so
strong
I
could
not
stand
.
<EOS>
I
sit
down
on
the
narrow
ledge
;
I
hush
the
scared
infant
in
my
lap
:
<EOS>
you
turn
an
angle
of
the
road
:
I
bend
forward
to
take
a
last
look
;
the
wall
crumble
;
I
be
shake
;
the
child
roll
from
my
knee
,
I
lose
my
balance
,
fall
,
and
wake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Jane
,
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
the
preface
,
sir
;
the
tale
be
yet
to
come
.
<EOS>
on
wake
,
a
gleam
dazzle
my
eye
;
I
think
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
daylight
!
<EOS>
but
I
be
mistaken
;
it
be
only
candlelight
.
<EOS>
Sophie
,
I
suppose
,
have
come
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
light
in
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
the
door
of
the
closet
,
where
,
before
go
to
bed
,
I
have
hang
my
wedding
-
dress
and
veil
,
stand
open
;
I
hear
a
rustling
there
.
<EOS>
I
ask
,
"
Sophie
,
what
be
you
do
?
"
<EOS>
no
one
answer
;
but
a
form
emerge
from
the
closet
;
it
take
the
light
,
hold
it
aloft
,
and
survey
the
garment
pendent
from
the
portmanteau
.
"
<EOS>
Sophie
!
<EOS>
Sophie
!
<EOS>
"
I
again
cry
:
and
still
it
be
silent
.
<EOS>
I
have
rise
up
in
bed
,
I
bend
forward
:
first
surprise
,
then
bewilderment
,
come
over
me
;
and
then
my
blood
creep
cold
through
my
vein
.

the
shape

before

never

my

long
down
her
back

I
know
not

dress
she
have
on

it

white

straight

whether
gown

sheet

not
at

presently
she
take
my
veil
from
its
place

she
hold
it
up
,
gaze
at
it
long
,
and
then
she
throw
it
over
her
own
head

and
turn
to
the
mirror

<EOS>
at
that
moment
I
see

reflection

quite
distinctly

dark
oblong
glass

It

a

at

thrust
up

I
lose
consciousness

for

no

the
broad
day

<EOS>
I
rise
,
bathe
my
head

face
in
water

drank
a
long
draught
;
feel
that

enfeeble
I

determine
that

you

I
impart
this

be

"
  
<EOS>
"
mental
terror
,
sir

<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
believe
them
to
be
only
such
:
I
wish
it
more
now
than
ever
;
since
even
you
can
not
explain
to
me
the
mystery
of
that
awful
visitant
.

"

since

can
not

it
must
have
be
unreal

"
but
,
sir
,
when
I
say
so
to
myself
on
rise
this
morning
,
and
when
I
look
round
the
room
to
gather
courage
and
comfort
from
the
cheerful
aspect
of
each
familiar
object
in
full
daylight
,
there
 
on
the
carpet
 
<EOS>
I
see
what
give
the
distinct
lie
to
my
hypothesis
,
 
the
veil
,
tear
from
top
to
bottom
in
two
half
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
Mr.
Rochester
start
and
shudder
;
he
hastily
fling
his
arm
round
me
.
"
<EOS>
thank
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
"
that
if
anything
malignant
do
come
near
you
last
night
,
it
be
only
the
veil
that
be
harm

oh
,
to
think
what
may
have
happen
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
draw
his
breath
short
,
and
strain
me
so
close
to
him
,
I
could
scarcely
pant
.
<EOS>
after
some
minute
'
silence
,
he
continue
,
cheerily
    
"
now
,
Janet
,
I
will
explain
to
you
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
half
dream
,
half
reality
.
<EOS>
a
woman
do
,
I
doubt
not
,
enter
your
room
:
and
that
woman
be
 
must
have
be
 
Grace
Poole
.
<EOS>
You
call
her
a
strange
be
yourself
:
from
all
you
know
,
you
have
reason
so
to
call
her
 
<EOS>
what
do
she
do
to
me
?
<EOS>
what
to
Mason
?
<EOS>
in
a
state
between
sleep
and
wake
,
you
notice
her
entrance
and
her
action
;
but
feverish
,
almost
delirious
as
you
be
,
you
ascribe
to
her
a
goblin
appearance
different
from
her
own
:
the
long
dishevel
hair
,
the
swell
black
face
,
the
exaggerated
stature
,
be
figment
of
imagination
;
result
of
nightmare
:
the
spiteful
tearing
of
the
veil
be
real
:
and
it
be
like
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
would
ask
why
I
keep
such
a
woman
in
my
house
:
when
we
have
be
marry
a
year
and
a
day
,
I
will
tell
you
;
but
not
now
.
<EOS>
be
you
satisfied
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
do
you
accept
my
solution
of
the
mystery
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflect
,
and
in
truth
it
appear
to
me
the
only
possible
one
:
<EOS>
satisfied
<EOS>
I
be
not
,
but
to
please
him
I
endeavour
to
appear
so
 
relieve
,
I
certainly
do
feel
;
so
I
answer
him
with
a
contented
smile
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
as
it
be
long
past
one
,
I
prepare
to
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
Sophie
sleep
with
Adele
in
the
nursery
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
as
I
light
my
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
there
be
room
enough
in
Adele
's
little
bed
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
share
it
with
her
to
-
night
,
Jane
:
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
incident
you
have
relate
should
make
you
nervous
,
and
I
would
rather
you
do
not
sleep
alone
:
promise
me
to
go
to
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
fasten
the
door
securely
on
the
inside
.
<EOS>
wake
Sophie
when
you
go
upstairs
,
under
pretence
of
request
her
to
rouse
you
in
good
time
<EOS>
to-
morrow
;
for
you
must
be
dress
and
have
finish
breakfast
before
eight
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
no
more
sombre
thought
:
chase
dull
care
away
,
Janet
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
hear
to
what
soft
whisper
the
wind
have
fall
?
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
more
beating
of
rain
against
the
window
-
pane
:
<EOS>
look
here
"
(
he
lift
up
the
curtain
)
 
<EOS>
"
it
be
a
lovely
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
.
<EOS>
half
heaven
be
pure
and
stainless
:
<EOS>
the
cloud
,
now
troop
before
the
wind
,
which
have
shift
to
the
west
,
be
file
off
eastward
in
long
,
silvered
column
.
<EOS>
the
moon
shine
peacefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Rochester
,
gaze
inquiringly
into
my
eye
,
"
how
be
my
Janet
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
night
be
serene
,
sir
;
and
so
be
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
you
will
not
dream
of
separation
and
sorrow
to
-
night
;
but
of
happy
love
and
blissful
union
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
prediction
be
but
half
fulfilled
:
I
do
not
indeed
dream
of
sorrow
,
but
as
little
do
I
dream
of
joy
;
for
I
never
sleep
at
all
.
<EOS>
with
little
Adele
in
my
arm
,
I
watch
the
slumber
of
childhood
 
so
tranquil
,
so
passionless
,
so
innocent
 
and
wait
for
the
come
day
:
all
my
life
be
awake
and
astir
in
my
frame
:
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
rise
I
rise
too
.
<EOS>
I
remember
Adele
clung
to
me
as
I
leave
her
<EOS>
:
I
remember
I
kiss
her
as
I
loosen
her
little
hand
from
my
neck
;
and
I
cry
over
her
with
strange
emotion
,
and
quit
her
because
I
fear
my
sobs
would
break
her
still
sound
repose
.
<EOS>
She
seem
the
emblem
of
my
past
life
;
and
here
I
be
now
to
array
myself
to
meet
,
the
dread
,
but
adore
,
type
of
my
unknown
future
day
.
    
<EOS>
Sophie
come
at
seven
to
dress
me
:
she
be
very
long
indeed
in
accomplish
her
task
;
so
long
that
Mr.
Rochester
,
grow
,
I
suppose
,
impatient
of
my
delay
,
send
up
to
ask
why
I
do
not
come
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
fasten
my
veil
(
the
plain
square
of
blond
after
all
)
to
my
hair
with
a
brooch
;
I
hurry
from
under
her
hand
as
soon
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
in
French
.
<EOS>
"
look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
:
you
have
not
take
one
peep
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
turn
at
the
door
:
I
see
a
robed
and
veiled
figure
,
so
unlike
my
usual
self
that
it
seem
almost
the
image
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
Jane
!
"
call
a
voice
,
and
I
hasten
down
.
<EOS>
I
be
receive
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
by
Mr.
Rochester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lingerer
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
"
my
brain
be
on
fire
with
impatience
,
and
you
tarry
so
long
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
me
into
the
dining
-
room
,
survey
me
keenly
all
over
,
pronounce
me
"
fair
as
a
lily
,
and
not
only
the
pride
of
his
life
,
but
the
desire
of
his
eye
,
"
and
then
tell
me
he
would
give
me
but
ten
minute
to
eat
some
breakfast
,
he
ring
the
bell
.
<EOS>
one
of
his
lately
hire
servant
,
a
footman
,
answer
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
John
get
the
carriage
ready
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
"
be

luggage
bring
down

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
bring
it
down

sir

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
you
to
the
church
:
see
if
Mr.
Wood
(
the
clergyman
)
and
the
clerk
be
there
:
return
and
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
church
,
as
the
reader
know
,
be
but
just
beyond
the
gate
;
the
footman
soon
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
be
in
the
vestry
,
sir
,
put
on
his
surplice

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
horse
be
harness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
want
it
to
go
to
church
;
but
it
must
be
ready
<EOS>
the
moment
we
return
:
all
the
box
and
luggage
arrange
and
strap
on
,
and
the
coachman
in
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
be
you
ready
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
rise
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
groomsman
,
no
bridesmaid
,
no
relative
to
wait
for
or
marshal
:
none
but
Mr.
Rochester
and
I.
Mrs.
Fairfax
stand
in
the
hall
as
we
pass
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
speak
to
her
,
but
my
hand
be
hold
by
a
grasp
of
iron
:
I
be
hurry
along
by
a
stride
I
could
hardly
follow
;
and
to
look
at
Mr.
Rochester
's
face
be
to
feel
that
not
a
second
of
delay
would
be
tolerate
for
any
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
other
bridegroom
ever
look
as
he
do
 
so
bent
up
to
a
purpose
,
so
grimly
resolute
:
or
who
,
under
such
steadfast
brow
,
ever
reveal
such
flaming
and
flashing
eye
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
the
day
be
fair
or
foul
;
in
descend
the
drive
,
I
gaze
neither
on
sky
nor
earth
:
my
heart
be
with
my
eye
;
and
both
seem
migrate
into
Mr.
Rochester
's
frame
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
the
invisible
thing
on
which
,
as
we
go
along
,
he
appear
to
fasten
a
glance
fierce
and
fall
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
feel
the
thought
whose
force
he
seem
breast
and
resist
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
churchyard
wicket
he
stop
:
he
discover
I
be
quite
out
of
breath
.
"
<EOS>
be
I
cruel
in
my
love
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
delay
an
instant
:
<EOS>
lean
on
me
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
can
recall
the
picture
of
the
grey
old
house
of
God
rise
calm
before
me
,
of
a
rook
wheeling
round
the
steeple
,
of
a
ruddy
morning
sky
beyond
.
<EOS>
I
remember
something
,
too
,
of
the
green
grave
-
mound
;
and
I
have
not
forget
,
either
,
two
figure
of
stranger
stray
amongst
the
low
hillock
and
read
the
memento
grave
on
the
few
mossy
head
-
stone
.
<EOS>
I
notice
them
,
because
,
as
they
see
us
,
they
pass
round
to
the
back
of
the
church
;
and
I
doubt
not
they
be
go
to
enter
by
the
side
-
aisle
door
and
witness
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
by
Mr.
Rochester
they
be
not
observe
;
he
be
earnestly
look
at
my
face
from
which
the
blood
have
<EOS>
,
I
daresay
,
momentarily
flee
:
for
I
feel
my
forehead
dewy
,
and
my
cheek
and
lip
cold
.
<EOS>
when
I
rally
,
which
I
soon
do
,
he
walk
gently
with
me
up
the
path
to
the
porch
.
  
<EOS>
We
enter
the
quiet
and
humble
temple
;
the
priest
wait
in
his
white
surplice
at
the
lowly
altar
,
the
clerk
beside
him
.
<EOS>
all
be
still
:
two
shadow
only
move
in
a
remote
corner
.
<EOS>
My
conjecture
have
be
correct
:
the
stranger
have
slip
in
before
us
,
and
they
now
stand
by
the
vault
of
the
Rochesters
,
their
back
towards
us
,
view
through
the
rail
the
old
time
-
stain
marble
tomb
,
where
a
kneel
angel
guard
the
remain
of
Damer
de
Rochester
,
slay
at
Marston
Moor
in
the
time
of
the
civil
war
,
and
of
Elizabeth
,
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Our
place
be
take
at
the
communion
rail
.
<EOS>
hear
a
cautious
step
behind
me
,
I
glance
over
my
shoulder
:
one
of
the
stranger
 
a
gentleman
,
evidently
 
be
advance
up
the
chancel
.
<EOS>
the
service
begin
.
<EOS>
the
explanation
of
the
intent
of
matrimony
be
go
through
;
and
then
the
clergyman
come
a
step
further
forward
,
and
,
bend
slightly
towards
Mr.
Rochester
,
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
require
and
charge
you
both
(
as
ye
will
answer
at
the
dreadful
day
of
judgment
,
when
the
secret
of
all
heart
shall
be
disclose
)
,
that
if
either
of
you
know
any
impediment
why
ye
may
not
lawfully
be
join
together
in
matrimony
,
ye
do
now
confess
it
;
for
be
<EOS>
ye
<EOS>
well
assure
that
so
many
as

together
by
God

neither

matrimony
lawful

"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
,
as
the
custom
be
.
<EOS>
when
be
the
pause
after
that
sentence
ever
break

me
behind

the
lunatic
sprang
and
grapple
his
throat
viciously

and
lay
her
tooth
to
his

they
struggle
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
big
woman

in
stature
almost
equal
her

corpulent
besides

virile

He
could
have
settle
her
with

plant
blow

but
he
would
not
strike
:
he
would
only
wrestle

<EOS>
at
last
he
master
her
arm
;
Grace
Poole
give
him
a
cord

and
he
pinion
them
behind
her

with

her

acrid

Mr.

astonish

distress
as
you
may
suppose

reveal
the

<EOS>
Your
uncle
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
be
now
on
a
sick
bed
;
from
which
,
consider
the
nature
of
his
disease
 
decline

the
stage
it
have
reach
,
it
be
unlikely
he
will
ever
rise

<EOS>
He
could
not
then
hasten
to
England
himself
,
to
extricate
you
from
the
snare
into
which
you
have
fall

but
he
implore
Mr.

I
would
advise

accompany

but
as
it
be

I
think
you
have
better
remain
in
England
till
you
can
hear
further
,
either
from

of
Mr.

have

anything

<EOS>
"
no

no

be
go

the
anxious
reply
;

without
wait
to
take
leave
of
Mr.

they
make
their
exit
at
the
hall
door

<EOS>
the
clergyman
stay
to
exchange
a

sentence

either
of
admonition

reproof

with
his
haughty
parishioner

this
duty
do

he
too
depart

<EOS>
I
hear
him
go
as
I
stand
at
the
half
-
open
door
of
my
own
room
,
to
which
I
have
now
withdraw
.
<EOS>
the
house
clear
,
I
shut
myself
in
,
fasten
the
bolt
that
none
may
intrude
,
and
proceed
 
not
to
weep
,
not
to
mourn
,
I
be
yet
too
calm
for
that
,

mechanically
to
take
off
the
wedding
dress

and
replace
it
by
the
stuff
gown
I
have
wear
yesterday

as
I

for
the

<EOS>
I
then
sit
down

I
feel
weak

tired

<EOS>
I
lean
my
arm
on
a
table

and
my
head
drop
on
them

<EOS>
and
now
I
think
:
till
now
I

only
hear
,
see

move
 
follow
up

down

I
be
lead

disclosure
open
beyond
disclosure

but
_
now

,
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
think
_
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
have
be
a
quiet
morning
enough
 
<EOS>
all
except
the
brief
scene
with
the
lunatic
:
the
transaction
in
the
church
have
not
be
noisy
;
there
be
no
explosion
of
passion
,
no
loud
altercation
,
no
dispute
,
no
defiance
or
challenge
,
no
tear
,
no
sobs
:
a
few
word
have
be
speak
,
a
calmly
pronounce
objection
to
the
marriage
make
;
some
stern
,
short
question
put
by
Mr.
Rochester
;
answer
,
explanation
give
,
evidence
adduce
;
an
open
admission
of
the
truth
have
be
utter
by
my
master
;
then
the
live
proof
have
be
see
;
the
intruder
be
go
,
and
all
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
my
own
room
as
usual
 
just
myself
,
without
obvious
change
:
<EOS>
nothing
have
smite
me
,
or
scathe
me
,
or
maim
me
.
<EOS>
and
yet
where
be
the
Jane
Eyre
of
yesterday
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
her
life
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
her
prospect
?
  
<EOS>
Jane
Eyre
,
who
have
be
an
ardent
,
expectant
woman
 
almost
a
bride
,
be
a
cold
,
solitary
girl
again
:
her
life
be
pale
;
her
prospect
be
desolate
.
<EOS>
a
Christmas
frost
have
come
at
midsummer
;
a
white
December
storm
have
whirl
over
June
;
ice
glaze
the
ripe
apple
,
drift
crush
the
blow
rose
;
on
hayfield
and
cornfield
lie
a
frozen
shroud
:
<EOS>
lane
which
last
night
blush
full
of
flower
,
to
-
day
be
pathless
with
untrodden
snow
;
and
the
wood
,
which
twelve
hour
since
wave
leafy
and
flagrant
as
grove
between
the
tropic
,
now
spread
,
waste
,
wild
,
and
white
as
pine

forest
in
wintry
Norway

<EOS>
My
hope
be
all
dead
 
strike
with
a
subtle
doom
,
such
as
,
in
one
night
,
fall
on
all
the
first
-
bear
in
the
land
of
Egypt
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
my
cherish
wish
,
yesterday
so
bloom
and
glowing
;
they
lie
stark
,
chill
,
livid
corpse
that
could
never
revive
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
love
:
<EOS>
that
feeling
which
be
my
master
's
 
which
he
have
create
;
it
shiver
in
my
heart
,
like
a
suffer
child
in
a
cold
cradle
;
sickness
and
anguish
have
seize
it
;
it
could
not
seek
Mr.
Rochester
's
arm
 
it
could
not
derive
warmth
from
his
breast
.
<EOS>
oh
,
never
more
could
it
turn
to
him
;
for
faith
be
blight
 
confidence
destroy
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
be
not
to
me
what
he
have
be
;
for
he
be
not
what
I
have
think
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
ascribe
vice
to
him
;
I
would
not
say
he
have
betray
me
;
but
the
attribute
of
stainless
truth
be
go
from
his
idea
,
and
from
his
presence
I
must
go
:
<EOS>
_
that
_
I
perceive
well
.
<EOS>
when
 
how
 
whither
,
I
could
not
yet
discern
;
but
he
himself
,
I
doubt
not
,
would
hurry
me
from
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
real
affection
,
it
seem
,
he
could
not
have
for
me
;
it
have
be
only
fitful
passion
:
that
be
balk
;
he
would
want
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
should
fear
even
to
cross
his
path
now
:
my
view
must
be
hateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
blind
have
be
my
eye
!
<EOS>
how
weak
my
conduct
!
  
<EOS>
My
eye
be
cover
and
closed
:
eddy
darkness
seem
to
swim
round
me
,
and
reflection
come
in
as
black
and
confuse
a
flow
.
<EOS>
self
-
abandon
,
relaxed
,
and
effortless
,
I
seem
to
have
lay
me
down
in
the
dry
-
up
bed
of
a
great
river
;
I
hear
a
flood
loosen
in
remote
mountain
,
and
feel
the
torrent
come
:
to
rise
I
have
no
will
,
to
flee
I
have
no
strength
.
<EOS>
I
lay
faint
,
long
to
be
dead
.
<EOS>
one
idea
only
still
throb
life
-
like
within
me
 
a
remembrance
of
God
:
it
beget
an
unuttered
prayer
:
these
word
go
wander
up
and
down
in
my
rayless
mind
,
as
something
that
should
be
whisper
,
but
no
energy
be
find
to
express
them
    
<EOS>
"
be
not
far
from
me
,
for
trouble
be
near
:
there
be
none
to
help
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
near
:
and
as
I
have
lift
no
petition
to
Heaven
to
avert
it
 
as
I
have
neither
join
my
hand
,
nor
bend
my
knee
,
nor
move
my
lip
 
<EOS>
it
come
:
in
full
heavy
swing
the
torrent
pour
over
me
.
<EOS>
the
whole
consciousness
of
my
life
lorn
,
my

,
my

quench
,
my
faith
death

strike
,
sway
full
and
mighty
above
me
in
one
sullen
mass
.
<EOS>
that
bitter
hour
can
not
be
describe
:
in
truth
,
"
the
water
come
into
my
soul
;
I
sink
in
deep
mire
:
I
feel
no
standing
;
I
come
into
deep
water
;
the
flood
overflow
me
.
"
    
<EOS>
some
time
in
the
afternoon
I
raise
my
head
,
and
look
round
and
see
the
western
sun
gild
the
sign
of
its
decline
on
the
wall
,
I
ask
,
"
what
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
answer
my
mind
give
 
"
Leave
Thornfield
at
once
"
 
<EOS>
be
so
prompt
,
so
dread
,
that
I
stop
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
could
not
bear
such
word
now
.
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
not
Edward
Rochester
's
bride
be
the
least
part
of
my
woe
,
"
I
allege
:
"
that
I
have
waken
out
of
most
glorious
dream
,
and
find
them
all
void
and
vain
,
be
a
horror
I
could
bear
and
master
;
but
that
I
must
leave
him
decidedly
,
instantly
,
entirely
,
be
intolerable
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
then
,
a
voice
within
me
aver
that
I
could
do
it
and
foretold
that
I
should
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
wrestle
with
my
own
resolution
:
I
want
to
be
weak
that
I
may
avoid
the
awful
passage
of
further
suffering
I
see
lay
out
for
me
;
and
Conscience
,
turn
tyrant
,
hold
passion
by
the
throat
,
tell
her
tauntingly
<EOS>
,
she
have
yet
but
dip
her
dainty
foot
in
the
slough
,
and
swear
that
with
that
arm
of
iron
he
would
thrust
her
down
to
unsounded
depth
of
agony
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
be
tear
away
,
"
then
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
let
another
help
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
you
shall
tear
yourself
away
<EOS>
,
none
shall
help
you
:
you
shall
yourself
pluck
out
your
right
eye
;
yourself
cut
off
your
right
hand
:
your
heart
shall
be
the
victim
,
and
you
the
priest
to
transfix
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rise
up
suddenly
,
terror
-
strike
at
the
solitude
which
so
ruthless
a
judge
haunt
,
 
at
the
silence
which
so
awful
a
voice
fill
.
<EOS>
My
head
swam
as
I
stand
erect
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
that
I
be
sicken
from
excitement
and
inanition
;
neither
meat
nor
drink
have
pass
my
lip
that
day
,
for
I
have
take
no
breakfast
.
<EOS>
and
,
with
a
strange
pang
,
I
now
reflect
that
,
long
as
I
have
be
shut
up
here
,
no
message
have
be
send
to
ask
how
I
be
,
or
to
invite
me
to
come
down
:
not
even
little
Adele
have
tap
at
the
door
;
not
even
Mrs.
Fairfax
have
seek
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
friend
always
forget
those
whom
fortune
forsake
,
"
I
murmur
,
as
I
undrew
the
bolt
and
pass
out
.
<EOS>
I
stumble
over
an
obstacle
:
my
head
be
still
dizzy
,
my
sight
be
dim
,
and
my
limb
be
feeble
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
soon
recover
myself
.
<EOS>
I
fall
,
but
not
on
to
the
ground
:
an
outstretched
arm
catch
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
 
<EOS>
I
be
support
by
Mr.
Rochester
,
who
sit
in
a
chair
across
my
chamber
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
out
at
last
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
have
be
wait
for
you
long
,
and
listening
:
<EOS>
yet
not
one
movement
<EOS>
have
I
hear
,
nor
one
sob
:
five
minute
more
of
that
death
-
like
hush
,
and
I
should
have
force
the
lock
like
a
burglar
.
<EOS>
so
you
shun
me
?
 
<EOS>
you
shut
yourself
up
and
grieve
alone
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
you
have
come
and
upbraid
me
with
vehemence
.
<EOS>
You
be
passionate
.
<EOS>
I
expect
a
scene
of
some

for

your

I
err

you
have
not
weep
at
all

<EOS>
I
see
a
white
cheek
and
a
fade
eye
,
but
no
trace
of
tear

I
suppose
,
then
,
your
heart
have
be
weep
blood

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Jane
!
<EOS>
not
a
word
of
reproach
?
<EOS>
nothing
bitter
 
nothing
poignant
?
<EOS>
nothing
to
cut
a
feeling
or
ste
a
passion
?
<EOS>
You
sit
quietly
where
I
have
place
you
,
and
regard
me
with
a
weary
,
passive
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Jane
,
I
never
mean
to
wound
you
thus
.
<EOS>
if
the
man

have

one
little
ewe
lamb
that
be
dear
to
him
as
a
daughter

that
eat
of

in

by
some
mistake
slaughter
it
at

not
have
rue
his

blunder
more
than
I
now
rue
mine

<EOS>
Will
you
ever
forgive
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
reader
,
I
forgive
him
at
the
moment
and
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
deep
remorse
in
his
eye
,
such
true
pity
in
his
tone
,
such
manly
energy
in
his
manner
;
and
besides
,
there
be
such
unchanged
love
in
his
whole
look
and
mien
 
<EOS>
I
forgave
him
all
:
yet
not
in
word
,
not
outwardly
;
only
at
my
heart
's
core
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
be
a
scoundrel
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
ere
long
he
inquire
wistfully
 
wondering
,
I
suppose
,
at
my
continued
silence
and
tameness
,
the
result
rather
of
weakness
than
of
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
tell
me
so
roundly
and
sharply
 
do
not
spare
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
:
I
be
tired
and
sick
.
<EOS>
I
want
some
water
.
"
<EOS>
He
heave
a
sort
of
shudder
sigh
,
and
take
me
in
his
arm
,
carry
me
downstairs
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
do
not
know
to
what
room
he
have
bear
me
;
all
be
cloudy
to
my
glazed
sight
:
presently
I
feel
the
reviving
warmth
of
a
fire
;
for
,
summer
as
it
be
,
I
have
become
icy
cold
in
my
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
put
wine
to
my
lip
;
I
taste
it
and
revive
;
then
I
eat
something
he
offer
me
,
and
be
soon
myself
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
library
 
sit
in
his
chair
 
<EOS>
he
be
quite
near
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
could
go
out
of
life
now
,
without
too
sharp
a
pang
,
it
would
be
well
for
me
,
"
I
think
;
"
then
I
should
not
have
to
make
the
effort
of
crack
my
heart
-
string
in
rend
them
from
among
Mr.
Rochester
's
.
<EOS>
I
must
leave
him

it
appear

him

<EOS>
"
how
be
you
now
,
Jane

"
  
<EOS>
"
much
well

I
shall
be
well
soon

<EOS>

taste
the
wine
again

Jane

"
  
<EOS>
I
obey
him
;
then
he
put
the
glass
on
the
table
,
stand
before
me
,
and
look
at
me
attentively
.
<EOS>
suddenly
he
turn
away
,
with
an
inarticulate
exclamation
,
full
of
passionate
emotion
of
some
kind
;
he
walk
fast
through
the
room
and
come
back
;
he
stoop
towards
me
as
if
to
kiss
me
;
but
I
remember
caress
be
now
forbid
.
<EOS>
I
turn
my
face
away
and
put
his
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
 
<EOS>
how
be
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
I
know
!
<EOS>
you
will
not
kiss
the
husband
of
Bertha
Mason

You
consider
my

fill

my
embrace
appropriate

<EOS>
"
at
any
rate

there
be
neither

<EOS>
"
why
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
I
will
spare
you
the
trouble
of
much
talking
;
I
will
answer
for
you
 
because
I
have
a
wife
already

you
would
reply

<EOS>
I
guess
rightly
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
think
so
,
you
must
have
a
strange
opinion
of
me
;
you
must
regard
me
as
a
plotting
profligate
 
<EOS>
a
base
and
low
rake
who
have
be
simulate
disintereste
love
in
order
to
draw
you
into
a
snare
deliberately
lay
,
and
strip
you
of
honour
and
rob
you
of
self

respect
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
that
?
<EOS>
I
see
you
can
say
nothing
in
the
first
place
,
you
be
faint
still
,
and
have
enough
to
do
to
draw
your
breath
;
in
the
second
place
,
you
can
not
yet
accustom
yourself
to
accuse
and
revile
me
,
and
besides
,
the
flood
-
gate
of
tear
be
open
,
and
they
would
rush
out
if
you
speak
much
;
and
you
have
no
desire
to
expostulate
,
to
upbraid
,
to
make
a
scene

how

"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir

I
do
not

I
say
;

my
unsteady
voice
warn
me
to
curtail
my
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
in
your
sense
of
the
word

in

to
destroy

You

as
good
as

as
a

man
you
will
shun
me

keep
out
of
my
way

just
now
you
have
refuse
to
kiss
me

<EOS>
You
intend
to
make
yourself
a
complete
stranger
to
me
:
to
live
under
this
roof
only
as
Adele
's
governess
;
if
ever
I
say
a
friendly
word
to
you

if
ever
a

feeling
incline
you
again
to

you
will
say

<EOS>
I
clear
and
steady
my
voice
to
reply
:

all

about

change
too

continual
combat

Adele

oh
,
Adele
will
go
to
school
 
<EOS>
I
have
settle
that
already

nor
do
I
mean
to
torment
you
with
the
hideous
association

recollection
of
Thornfield
Hall
 
this
accursed
place
 
<EOS>
this
tent
of
Achan
 
<EOS>
this
insolent
vault

offer
the
ghastliness
of
live
death
to
the
light
of
the
open
sky
 
this
narrow
stone
hell
,
with
its
one
real
fiend

bad
than
a
legion
of
such
as
we
imagine

<EOS>
Jane
,
you
shall
not
stay
here
,
nor
will
I.
I
be
wrong
ever
to
bring
you
to
Thornfield
Hall
,
know
as
I
do
how
it
be
haunt
.
<EOS>
I
charge
them
to
conceal
from
you
,
before
I
ever
see
you
,
all
knowledge
of
the
curse
of
the
place
;
merely
because
I
fear
Adele
never
would
have
a
governess
to
stay
if
she
know
with
what
inmate
she
be
house
,
and
my
plan
would
not
permit
me
to
remove
the
maniac
elsewhere
 
though
I
possess
an
old
house
,
Ferndean
Manor
,
even
more
retired
and
hide
than
this
,
where
I
could
have
lodge
her
safely
enough
,
have
not
a
scruple
about
the
unhealthiness
of
the
situation
,
in
the
heart
of
a
wood
,
make
my
conscience
recoil
from
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
probably
those
damp
wall
would
soon
have
ease
me
of
her
charge
:
<EOS>
but
to
each
villain
his
own
vice
;
and
mine
be
not
a
tendency
to
indirect
assassination
,
even
of
what
I
most
hate
.
  
<EOS>
"
conceal
the
mad
-
woman
's
neighbourhood
from
you

however
,
be
something
like
cover
a
child
with
a
cloak
and
lay
it
down
near
a
upas
-
tree
:
that
demon
's
vicinage

poison
,

always

<EOS>
but
I
will
shut
up
Thornfield
Hall

I
will
nail
up
the
front
door

board
the
low
window

I
will
give
Mrs.
Poole
two
hundred
a
year
to
live
here
with
_
my
wife
_
,
as
you
term
that
fearful
hag

grace
will
do
much
for
money

she
shall
have
her
son
,
the
keeper
at
Grimsby
Retreat
,
to
bear
her
company
and
be
at
hand
to
give
her
aid
in

paroxysm

her
familiar
to
burn
people
in

to
bite
their
flesh

"
Sir

I

me
again

mad

indeed

mistaken

you

nothing
about

nothing
about
the
sort

I

my
treasure
still

my
arm
should
confine
you

and
not
a
strait
waistcoat
 
<EOS>
your
grasp

even
in
fury

would
have
a
charm
for
me
:
if
you
fly
at
me
as
wildly
as
that
woman
do
this
morning
,
I
should
receive
you
in
an
embrace
,
at

as
fond
as
it
would
be
restrictive
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
shrink
from
you
with
disgust
as
I
do
from
her
:
in
your
quiet
moment
you
should
have
no
watcher
and
no
nurse
but
me
;
and
I
could
hang
over
you
with
untire
tenderness
,
though
you
give
me
no
smile
in
return
;
and
never
weary
of
gaze
into
your
eye

though
they
have
no

a
ray
of
recognition
for
me

farewell

terror

a
place

sanctuary

hateful
reminiscence

from
unwelcome
intrusion

explanation

<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
:
it
require
a
degree
of
courage
,
excite
as
he
be
become
,
even
to
risk
that
mute
sign
of
dissent

<EOS>
He
have
be
walk
fast
about
the
room
,
and
he
stop
,
as
if
suddenly
root
to
one
spot
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
long
and
hard
:
<EOS>
I
turn
my
eye
from
him
,
fix
them
on
the
fire
,
and
try
to
assume
and
maintain
a
quiet
,
collect
aspect
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
for
the
hitch
in
Jane
's
character
,
"
he
say
at
last
,
speak
more
calmly
than
from
his
look
I
have
expect
him
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
the
reel
of
silk
have
run
smoothly
enough
so
far
;
but
I
always
know
there
would
come
a
knot
and
a
puzzle
:
here
it
be
.
<EOS>
now
for
vexation
,
and
exasperation
,
and
endless
trouble
!
<EOS>
by
God
!
<EOS>
I
long
to
exert
a
fraction
of
Samson
's
strength
,
and
break
the
entanglement
like
tow
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
recommence
his
walk
,
but
soon
again
stop
,
and
this
time
just
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
will
you
hear
reason
?
"
(
he
stoop
and
approach
his
lip
to
my
ear
)
;
"
because
,
if
you
will
not
,
I
will
try
violence

<EOS>
His
voice
be
hoarse
;
his
look
that
of
a
man
who
be
just
about
to
burst
an
insufferable
bond
and
plunge
headlong
into
wild
license
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
in
another
moment
,
and
with
one
impetus
of
frenzy
more
,
I
should
be
able
to
do
nothing
with
him

the
present
 
<EOS>
the
pass
second
of
time

all
I
have
in
which
to
control

restrain
him
 
a
movement
of
repulsion
,
flight
<EOS>
,
fear
would
have
seal
my
doom
,
 
and
his
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
afraid
:
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
feel
an
inward
power
;
a
sense
of
influence
,
which
support
me

<EOS>
the
crisis
be
perilous
;
but
not
without
its
charm
:
such
as
the
Indian
,
perhaps
,
feel
when
he
slip
over
the
rapid
in
his
canoe
.
<EOS>
I
take
hold
of
his
clenched
hand
,
loosen
the
contort
finger
,
and
say
to
him
,
soothingly
    
"
sit
down
;
I
will
talk
to
you
as
long
as
you
like
,
and
hear
all
you
have
to
say
,
whether
reasonable
or
unreasonable
.

<EOS>
He
sit
down
:
but
he
do
not
get
leave
to
speak
directly
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
struggle
with
tear
for
some
time
:
I
have
take
great
pain
to
repress
them
,
because
I
know
he
would
not
like
to
see
me
weep
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
I
consider
it
well
to
let
them
flow
as
freely
and
as
long
as
they
like
.
<EOS>
if
the
flood
annoy
him
,
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
so
I
give
way
and
cry
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
soon
I
hear
him
earnestly
entreat
me
to
be
compose
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
could
not
while
he
be
in
such
a
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
not
angry
,
Jane
:
I
only
love
you
too
well
;
and
you
have
steel
your
little
pale
face
with
such
a
resolute
,
frozen
look
,
I
could
not
endure
it
.
<EOS>
Hush
,
now
,
and
wipe
your
eye
.

<EOS>
His
softened
voice
announce
that
he
be
subdue
;
so
I
,
in
my
turn
,
become
calm
.
<EOS>
now
he
make
an
effort
to
rest
his
head
on
my
shoulder
,
but
I
would
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
then
he
would
draw
me
to
him
:
no

<EOS>
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane

<EOS>
he
say
,
in
such
an
accent
of
bitter
sadness
it
thrill
along
every
nerve
I
have
;
"
you
do
not
love
me

then

<EOS>
It
be
only
my
station

the
rank
of
my

that
you
value

<EOS>
now
that
you
think
me
disqualify

recoil
from
my

I

toad

<EOS>
these
word
cut
me
:
yet
what
could
I
do
or
<EOS>
I
say
?
<EOS>
I
ought
probably
to
have
do
or
say
nothing
;

I
be
so
torture
by
a
sense
of
remorse
at
thus
hurt
his

balm

His

well

be
so

it

his
resolution

keep
the
property
together

he
could
not

the
idea
of
divide
his
estate

leave
me
a

all

as

endure
that

inquiry

Mr.

that

would
give

a
fortune
of
thirty
thousand
pound

that
suffice

when
I
leave
college

I
be
send
out
to
Jamaica

to
espouse
a
bride
already
court

say
nothing
about
her
money

he
tell
me
Miss
Mason
be
the
boast
of
Spanish
Town
for
her
beauty

this
be
no

I
find
her
a
fine
woman

in

Blanche
Ingram

tall

dark

majestic

Her
family
wish
to
secure
me

so
do
she

her
to
me
in
party

splendidly
dressed

my
sense
be
excited
;

be
ignorant

raw

inexperienced

think
I
love
her

there
be
no
folly

besotte
that
the
idiotic
rivalry

society

the
prurience

the
treachery

concealment

I
should

make
them
no

be
the
very
natal
pang
of
the
divine
passion
.
<EOS>
I
accept
it
,
Jane
;
let
the
daughter
have
free
advent
 
<EOS>
my
arm
wait
to
receive
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
sir
,
proceed
;
what
do
you
do
when
you
find
she
be
mad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
I
approach
the
verge
of
despair
;
a
remnant
of
self
-
respect
be
all
that
intervene
between
me
and
the
gulf
.
<EOS>
in
the
eye
of
the
world
,
I
be
doubtless
cover
with
grimy
dishonour
;
but
I
resolve
to
be
clean
in
my
own
sight
 
and
to
the
last
<EOS>
I
repudiate
the
contamination
of
her
crime
,
and
wrench
myself
from
connection
with
her
mental
defect
.
<EOS>
still
,
society
associate
my
name
and
person
with
her
;
I
yet
see
her
and
hear
her
daily
:
something
of
her
breath
(
faugh
!
)
<EOS>
mix
with
the
air
I
breathe
;
and
besides
,
I
remember
I
have
once
be
her
husband
 
<EOS>
that
recollection
be
then
,
and
be
now
,
inexpressibly
odious
to
me
;
moreover
,
I
know
that
while
she
live
I
could
never
be
the
husband
of
another
and
well
wife
;
and
,
though
five
year
my
senior
(
her
family
and
her
father
have
lie
to
me
even
in
the
particular
of
her
age
)
,
she
be
likely
to
live
as
long
as
I
,
be
as
robust
in
frame
as
she
be
infirm
in
mind
.
<EOS>
thus
,
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
six
,
I
be
hopeless
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
night
I
have
be
awaken
by
her
yell
 
(
since
the
medical
man
have
pronounce
her
mad
,
she
have
,
of
course
,
be
shut
up
)
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
fiery
west
indian
night
;
one
of
the
description
that
frequently
precede
the
hurricane
of
those
climate
.
<EOS>
be
unable
to
sleep
in
bed
,
I
get
up
and
open
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
like
sulphur
-
steam
 
<EOS>
I
could
find
no
refreshment
anywhere
.
<EOS>
mosquito
come
buzz
in
and
hum
sullenly
round
the
room
;
the
sea
,
which
I
could
hear
from
thence
,
rumble
dull
like
an
earthquake
 
black
cloud
be
cast
up
over
it
;
the
moon
be
set
in
the
wave
,
broad
and
red
,
like
a
hot
cannon
-
ball
 
<EOS>
she
throw
her
last
bloody
glance
over
a
world
quiver
with
the
ferment
of
temp
.
<EOS>
I
be
physically
influence
by
the
atmosphere
and
scene
,
and
my
ear
be
fill
with
the
curse
the
maniac
still
shriek
out
;
wherein
she
momentarily
mingle
my
name
with
such
a
tone
of
demon
-
hate
,
with
such
language
!
 
<EOS>
no
professed
harlot
ever
have
a
fouler
vocabulary
than
she
:
<EOS>
though
two
room
off
,
I
hear
every
word
 
the
thin
partition
of
the
West
India
house
opposing
but
slight
obstruction
to
her
wolfish
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
this
life
,
"
say
I
at
last
,
"
be
hell
:
this
be
the
air
 
<EOS>
those
be
the
sound
of
the
bottomless
pit
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
to
deliver
myself
from
it
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
the
suffering
of
this
mortal
state
will
leave
me
with
the
heavy
flesh
that
now
cumber
my
soul
.
<EOS>
of
the
fanatic
's
burn
eternity
I
have
no
fear
:
there
be
not
a
future
state
bad
than
this
present
one
 
<EOS>
let
me
break
away
,
and
go
home
to
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
this
whilst
I
knelt
down
at
,
and
unlock
a
trunk
which
contain
a
brace
of
loaded
pistol
:
I
mean
to
shoot
myself
.
<EOS>
I
only
entertain
the
intention
for
a
moment
;
for
,
not
be
insane
,
the
crisis
of
exquisite
and
unalloyed
despair
,
which
have
originate
the
wish
and
design
of
self
-
destruction
,
be
past
in
a
second
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
wind
fresh
from
Europe
blow
over
the
ocean
and
rush
through
the
open
casement
:
the
storm
break
,
stream
,
thunder
,
blaze
,
and
<EOS>
the
air
grow
pure
.
<EOS>
I
then
frame
and
fix
a
resolution
.
<EOS>
while
I
walk
under
the
dripping
orange
-
tree
of
my
wet
garden
,
and
amongst
its
drench
pomegranate
and
pine
-
apple
,
and
while
the
refulgent
dawn
of
the
tropic
kindle
round
me
 
I
reason
thus
,
Jane
 
and
now
listen
;
for
it
be
true
Wisdom
that
console
me
in
that
hour
,
and
show
me
the
right
path
to
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
sweet
wind
from
Europe
be
still
whisper
in
the
refreshed
leave
,
and
the
Atlantic
be
thunder
in
glorious
liberty
;
my
heart
,
dry
up
and
scorch
for
a
long
time
,
swell
to
the
tone
,
and
fill
with
live
blood
 
my
being
long
for
renewal
 
<EOS>
my
soul
thirst
for
a
pure
draught
.
<EOS>
I
see
hope
revive
 
and
feel
regeneration
possible
.
<EOS>
from
a
flowery
arch
at
the
bottom
of
my
garden
I
gaze
over
the
sea
 
bluer
than
the
sky
:
the
old
world
be
beyond
;
clear
prospect
open
thus
:
    
"
"
go
,
"
say
Hope
,
"
and
live
again
in
Europe
<EOS>
:
there
it
be
not
know
what
a
sullied
name
you
bear
,
nor
what
a
filthy
burden
be
bind
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
take
the
maniac
with
you
to
England
;
confine
her
with
due
attendance
and
precaution
at
Thornfield
:
then
travel
yourself
to
what
clime
you
will
,
and
form
what
new
tie
you
like
.
<EOS>
that
woman
,
who
have
so
abuse
your
long-
suffering
,
so
sully
your
name
,
so
outrage
your
honour
,
so
blight
your
youth
,
be
not
your
wife
,
nor
be
you
her
husband
.
<EOS>
see
that
she
be
care
for
as
her
condition
demand
,
and
you
have
do
all
that
God
and
humanity
require
of
you
.
<EOS>
let
her
identity
,
her
connection
with
yourself
,
be
bury
in
oblivion
:
you
be
bind
to
impart
them
to
no
live
being
.
<EOS>
place
her
in
safety
and
comfort
:
shelter
her
degradation
with
secrecy
,
and
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
act
precisely
on
this
suggestion
.
<EOS>
My
father
and
brother
have
not
make
my
marriage
know
to
their
acquaintance
;
because
,
in
the
very
first
letter
I
write
to
apprise
them
of
the
union
 
have
already
begin
to
experience
extreme
disgust
of
its
consequence
,
and
,
from
the
family
character
and
constitution
,
see
a
hideous
future
opening
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
add
an
urgent
charge
to
keep
it
secret
:
and
very
soon
the
infamous
conduct
of
the
wife
my
father
have
select
for
me
be
such
as
to
make
him
blush
to
own
her
as
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
far
from
desire
to
publish
the
connection
,
he
become
as
anxious
to
conceal
it
as
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
England
,
then
,
I
convey
her
;
a
fearful
voyage
I
have
with
such
a
monster
in
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
Glad
be
I
when
I
at
last
get
her
to
Thornfield
,
and
see
her
safely
lodge
in
that
third
-
storey
room
,
of
whose
secret
inner
cabinet
she
have
now
for
ten
year
make
a
wild
beast
's
den
 
a
goblin
's
cell
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
trouble
in
find
an
attendant
for
her
,
as
it
be
necessary
to
select
one
on
whose
fidelity
dependence
could
be
place
;
for
her
raving
would
inevitably
betray
my
secret
:
besides
,
she
have
lucid
interval
of
day
 
<EOS>
sometimes
week
 
which
she
fill
up
with
abuse
of
me
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
hire
Grace
Poole
from
the
Grimbsy
Retreat
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
surgeon
,
Carter
(
who
dress
Mason
's
wound
<EOS>
that
night
he
be
stab
and
worried
)
,
be
the
only
two
I
have
ever
admit
to
my
confidence
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairfax
may
indeed
have
suspect
something
,
but
she
could
have
gain
no
precise
knowledge
as
to
fact
.
<EOS>
grace
have
,
on
the
whole
,
prove
a
good
keeper
;
though
,
owe
partly
to
a
fault
of
her
own
,
of
which
it
appear
nothing
can
cure
her
,
and
which
be
incident
to
her
harass
profession
,
her
vigilance
have
be
more
than
once
lull
and
baffle
.
<EOS>
the
lunatic
be
both
cunning
and
malignant
;
she
have
never
fail
to
take
advantage
of
her
guardian
's
temporary
lapse
;
once
to
secrete
the
knife
with
which
she
stab
her
brother
,
and
twice
to
possess
herself
of
the
key
of
her
cell
,
and
issue
therefrom
in
the
night
-
time
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
of
these
occasion
,
she
perpetrate
the
attempt
to
burn
me
in
my
bed
;
on
the
second
,
she
pay
that
ghastly
visit
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
thank
Providence
,
who
watch
over
you
,
that
she
then
spend
her
fury
on
your
wedding
apparel
,
which
perhaps
bring
back
vague
reminiscence
of
her
own
bridal
day
:
<EOS>
but
on
what
may
have
happen
,
I
can
not
endure
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
the
thing
which
fly
at
my
throat
this
morning
,
hang
its
black
and
scarlet
visage
over
the
nest
of
my
dove
,
my
blood
curdle
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
what
,
sir
,
"
I
ask
,
while
he
pause
,
"
do
you
do
when
you
have
settle
her
here
?
<EOS>
where
do
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
do
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
I
transform
myself
into
a
will
-
o'-the
-
wisp
.
<EOS>
where
do
I
go
?
<EOS>
I
pursue
wandering
as
wild
as
those
of
the
March
-
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
seek
the
continent
,
and
go
devious
through
all
its
land
.
<EOS>
My
fix
desire
be
to
seek
and
find
a
good
and
intelligent
woman
,
whom
I
could
love
:
a
contrast
to
the
fury
I
leave
at
Thornfield
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
could
not
marry
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
determine
and
be
convince
that
I
could
and
ought
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
original
intention
to
deceive
,
as
I
have
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
tell
my
tale
plainly
,
and
make
my
proposal
openly
:
and
it
appear
to
me
so
absolutely
rational
that
I
should
be
consider
free
to
love
and
be
love
,
I
never
doubt
some
woman
may
be
find
willing
and
able
to
understand
my
case
and
accept
me
,
in
spite
of
the
curse
with
which
I
be
burden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
be
inquisitive
,
Jane
,
you
always
make
me
smile
.
<EOS>
You
open
your
eye
like
an
eager
bird
,
and
make
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
restless
movement
,
as
if
answer
in
speech
do
not
flow
fast
enough
for
you
,
and
you
want
to
read
the
tablet
of
one
's
heart
.
<EOS>
but
before
I
go
on
,
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
your
"
well
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
small
phrase
very
frequent
with
you
;
and
which
many
a
time
have
draw
me
on
and
on
through
interminable
talk
:
I
do
not
very
well
know
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
 
what
next
?
<EOS>
how
do
you
proceed
?
<EOS>
what
come
of
such
an
event
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
precisely
!
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
wish
to
know
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
whether
you
find
any
one
you
like
:
whether
you
ask
her
to
marry
you
;
and
what
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
can
tell
you
whether
I
find
any
one
I
like
,
and
whether
I
ask
her
to
marry
me
:
but
what
she
say
be
yet
to
be
record
in
the
book
of
Fate
.
<EOS>
for
ten
long
year
I
rove
about
,
live
first
in
one
capital
,
then
another
:
sometimes
in
St.
Petersburg
;
oftener
in
Paris
;
occasionally
in
Rome
,
Naples
,
and
Florence
.
<EOS>
provide
with
plenty
of
money
and
the
passport
of
an
old
name
,
I
could
choose
my
own
society
:
no
circle
be
close
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
seek
my
ideal
of
a
woman
amongst
english
lady
,
french
countess
,
italian
signora
,
and
german
grafinnen
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
her
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
for
a
fleeting
moment
,
I
think
I
catch
a
glance
,
hear
a
tone
,
beheld
a
form
,
which
announce
the
realisation
of
my
dream
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
presently
undeserved
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
to
suppose
that
I
desire
perfection
,
either
of
mind
or
person
.
<EOS>
I
long
only
for
what
suit
me
 
for
the
antipode
of
the
Creole
:
and
I
long
vainly
.
<EOS>
amongst
them
all
I
find
not
one
whom
,
have
I
be
ever
so
free
<EOS>
,
I
 
warn
as
I
be
of
the
risk
,
the
horror
,
the
loathing
of
incongruous
union
 
would
have
ask
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
disappointment
make
me
reckless
.
<EOS>
I
try
dissipation
 
never
debauchery
:
that
I
hate
,
and
hate
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
Indian
Messalina
's
attribute
:
root
disgust
at
it
and
<EOS>
her
restrain
me
much
,
even
in
pleasure
.
<EOS>
any
enjoyment
that
border
on
riot
seem
to
approach
me
to
her
and
her
vice
,
and
I
eschew
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
yet
I
could
not
live
alone
;
so
I
try
the
companionship
of
mistress
.
<EOS>
the
first
I
choose
be
Celine
Varens
 
another
of
those
step
which
make
a
man
spurn
himself
when
he
recall
them
.
<EOS>
You
already
know
what
she
be
,
and
how
my
liaison
with
her
terminate
.
<EOS>
She
have
two
successor
:
an
Italian
,
Giacinta
,
and
a
German
,
Clara
;
<EOS>
both
consider
singularly
handsome
.
<EOS>
what
be
their
beauty
to
me
in
a
few
week
?
<EOS>
Giacinta
be
unprincipled
and
violent
:
I
tired
of
her
in
three
month
.
<EOS>
Clara
be
honest
and
quiet
;
but
heavy
,
mindless
,
and
unimpressible
:
not
one
whit
to
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
give
her
a
sufficient
sum
to
set
her
up
in
a
good
line
of
business
,
and
so
get
decently
rid
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
Jane
,
I
see
by
your
face
you
be
not
form
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
me
just
now
.
<EOS>
You
think
me
an
unfeeling
,
loose
-
principled
rake
:
do
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
you
so
well
as
I
have
do
sometimes
,
indeed
,
sir
.
<EOS>
do
it
not
seem
to
you
in
the
least
wrong
to
live
in
that
way
,
first
with
one
mistress
and
then
another
?
<EOS>
You
talk
of
it
as
a
mere
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
with
me
;
and
I
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
grovel
fashion
of
existence
:
I
should
never
like
to
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
hire
a
mistress
be
the
next
bad
thing
to
buy
a
slave
:
both
be
often
by
nature
,
and
always
by
position
,
inferior
:
and
to
live
familiarly
with
inferior
be
degrade
.
<EOS>
I
now
hate
the
recollection
of
the
time
I
pass
with
Celine
,
Giacinta
,
and
Clara
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
the
truth
of
these
word
;
and
I
draw
from
them
the
certain
inference
,
that
if
I
be
so
far
to
forget
myself
and
all
the
teaching
that
have
ever
be
instill
into
me
,
as
 
under
any
pretext
 
with
any
justification
 
through
any
temptation
 
to
become
the
successor
of
these
poor
girl
,
he
would
one
day
regard
me
with
the
same
feeling
which
now
in
his
mind
desecrate
their
memory
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
give
utterance
to
this
conviction
:
it
be
enough
to
feel
it
.
<EOS>
I
impress
it
on
my
heart
,
that
it
may
remain
there
to
serve
me
as
aid
in
the
time
of
trial
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Jane
,
why
do
not
you
say
"
well
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
look
grave
.
<EOS>
You
disapprove
of
me
still
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
last
January
,
rid
of
all
mistress
 
in
a
harsh
,
bitter
frame
of
mind
,
the
result
of
a
useless
,
roving
,
lonely
life
 
corrode
with
disappointment
,
sourly
disposed
against
all
man
,
and
especially
against
all
womankind
(
for
I
begin
to
regard
the
notion
of
an
intellectual
,
faithful
,
love
woman
as
a
mere
dream
)
,
recall
by
business
<EOS>
,
I
come
back
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
a
frosty
winter
afternoon
,
I
ride
in
sight
of
Thornfield
Hall
.
<EOS>
abhorred
spot
!
<EOS>
I
expect
no
peace
 
no
pleasure
there
.
<EOS>
on
a
stile
in
Hay
Lane
I
see
a
quiet
little
figure
sit
by
itself
.
<EOS>
I
pass
it
as
negligently
as
I
do
the
pollard
willow
opposite
to
it
:
I
have
no
presentiment
of
what
it
would
be
to
me
;
no
inward
warning
that
the
arbitress
of
my
life
 
my
genius
for
good
or
evil
 
wait
there
in
humble
guise
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
it
,
even
when
,
on
the
occasion
of
Mesrour
's
accident
,
it
come
up
and
gravely
offer
me
help
.
<EOS>
childish
and
slend
creature
!
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
a
linnet
have
hop
to
my
foot
and
propose
to
bear
me
on
its
tiny
wing
.
<EOS>
I
be
surly
;
but
the
thing
would
not
go
:
it
stand
by
me
with
strange
perseverance
,
and
look
and
speak
with
a
sort
of
authority
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
aid
,
and
by
that
hand
:
and
aid
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
once
I
have
press
the
frail
shoulder
,
something
new
 
a
fresh
sap
and
sense
 
stole
into
my
frame
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
<EOS>
I
have
learn
that
this
elf
must
return
to
me
 
that
it
belong
to
my
house
down
below
 
<EOS>
or
I
could
not
have
feel
it
pass
away
from
under
my
hand
,
and
see
it
vanish
behind
the
dim
hedge
,
without
singular
regret
.
<EOS>
I
hear
you
come
home
that
night
,
Jane
,
though
probably
you
be
not
aware
that
I
think
of
you
or
watch
for
you
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
observe
you
 
myself
unseen
 
for
half
-
an-
hour
,
while
you
play
with
Adele
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
snowy
day
,
I
recollect
,
and
you
could
not
go
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
my
room
;
the
door
be
ajar
:
I
could
both
listen
and
watch
.
<EOS>
Adele
claim
your
outward
attention
for
a
while
;
yet
I
fancy
your
thought
be
elsewhere
:
but
you
be
very
patient
with
her
,
my
little
Jane
;
you
talk
to
her
and
amuse
her
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
she
leave
you
,
you
lapse
at
once
into
deep
reverie
:
you
betook
yourself
slowly
to
pace
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
,
in
pass
a
casement
,
you
glance
out
at
the
thick
-
fall
snow
;
you
listen
to
the
sob
wind
,
and
again
you
pace
gently
on
and
dream
.
<EOS>
I
think
those
day
vision
be
not
dark
:
there
be
a
pleasurable
illumination
in
your
eye
occasionally
,
a
soft
excitement
in
your
aspect
,
which
tell
of
no
bitter
,
bilious
,
hypochondriac
brooding
:
<EOS>
your
look
reveal
rather
the
sweet
musing
of
youth
when
its
spirit
follow
on
willing
wing
the
flight
of
Hope
up
and
on
to
an
ideal
heaven
.
<EOS>
the
voice
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
speak
to
a
servant
in
the
hall
,
waken
you
:
and
how
curiously
you
smile
to
and
at
yourself
,
Janet
!
<EOS>
there
be
much
sense
in
your
smile
:
it
be
very
shrewd
,
and
seem
to
make
light
of
your
own
abstraction
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
say
 
"
My
fine
vision
be
all
very
well
,
but
I
must
not
forget
they
be
absolutely
unreal
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
rosy
sky
and
a
green
flowery
Eden
in
my
brain
;
but
without
,
I
be
perfectly
aware
,
lie
at
my
foot
a
rough
tract
to
travel
,
and
around
me
gather
black
tempest
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
"
You
run
downstairs
and
demand
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
some
occupation
:
the
weekly
house
account
to
make
up
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
I
think
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
vex
with
you
for
get
out
of
my
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
impatiently
I
wait
for
evening
,
when
I
may
summon
you
to
my
presence
.
<EOS>
an
unusual
 
to
me
 
a
perfectly
new
character
I
suspect
be
yours
:
<EOS>
I
desire
to
search
it
deeper
and
know
it
better
.
<EOS>
You
enter
the
room
with
a
look
and
air
at
once
shy
and
independent
:
you
be
quaintly
dress
 
much
as
you
be
now
.
<EOS>
I
make
you
talk
:
<EOS>
ere
long
I
find
you
full
of
strange
contrast
.
<EOS>
Your
garb
and
manner
be
restrict
by
rule
;
your
air
be
often
diffident
,
and
altogether
that
of
one
refine
by
nature
,
but
absolutely
unused
to
society
,
and
a
good
deal
afraid
of
make
herself
disadvantageously
conspicuous
by
some
solecism
or
blunder
;
yet
when
address
,
you
lift
a
keen
,
a
daring
,
and
a
glowing
eye
to
your
interlocutor
's
face
:
<EOS>
there
be
penetration
and
power
in
each
glance
you
give
;
when
ply
by
close
question
,
you
find
ready
and
round
answer
.
<EOS>
very
soon
you
seem
to
get
used
to
me
:
<EOS>
I
believe
you
feel
the
existence
of
sympathy
between
you
and
your
grim
and
cross
master
,
Jane
;
for
it
be
astonishing
to
see
how
quickly
a
certain
pleasant
ease
tranquillise
your
manner
:
<EOS>
snarl
as
I
would
<EOS>
,
you
show
no
surprise
,
fear
,
annoyance
,
or
displeasure
at
my
moroseness
;
you
watch
me
,
and
now
and
then
smile
at
me
with
a
simple
yet
sagacious
grace
I
can
not
describe
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
once
content
and
stimulate
with
what
I
see
:
I
like
what
I
have
see
,
and
wish
to
see
more
.
<EOS>
yet
,
for
a
long
time
,
I
treat
you
distantly
,
and
seek
your
company
rarely
.
<EOS>
I
be
an
intellectual
epicure
,
and
wish
to
prolong
the
gratification
of
make
this
novel
and
piquant
acquaintance
:
besides
,
I
be
for
a
while
trouble
with
a
haunting
fear
that
if
I
handle
the
flower
freely
its
bloom
would
fade
 
the
sweet
charm
of
freshness
would
leave
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
then
know
that
it
be
no
transitory
blossom
,
but
rather
the
radiant
resemblance
of
one
,
cut
in
an
indestructible
gem
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
I
wish
to
see
whether
you
would
seek
me
if
I
shun
you
 
<EOS>
but
you
do
not
;
you
keep
in
the
schoolroom
as
still
as
your
own
desk
and
easel
;
if
by
chance
I
meet
you
,
you
pass
me
as
soon
,
and
with
as
little
token
of
recognition
,
as
be
consistent
with
respect
.
<EOS>
Your
habitual
expression
in
those
day
,
Jane
,
be
a
thoughtful
look
;
not
despondent
,
for
you
be
not
sickly
;
but
not
buoyant
,
<EOS>
for
you
have
little
hope
,
and
no
actual
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
you
think
of
me
,
or
if
you
ever
think
of
me
,
and
resolve
to
find
this
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
resume
my
notice
of
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
glad
in
your
glance
,
and
genial
in
your
manner
,
when
you
converse
:
I
see
you
have
a
social
heart
;
it
be
the
silent
schoolroom
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
tedium
of
your
life
 
that
make
you
mournful
.
<EOS>
I
permit
myself
the
delight
of
be
kind
to
you
;
kindness
stir
emotion
soon
:
<EOS>
your
face
become
soft
in
expression
,
your
tone
gentle
;
I
like
my
name
pronounce
by
your
lip
in
a
grateful
happy
accent
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
enjoy
a
chance
meet
with
you
,
Jane
,
at
this
time
:
there
be
a
curious
hesitation
in
your
manner
:
you
glance
at
me
with
a
slight
trouble
 
a
hovering
doubt
:
you
do
not
know
what
my
caprice
may
be
 
whether
I
be
go
to
play
the
master
and
be
stern
,
or
the
friend
and
be
benignant
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
too
fond
of
you
often
to
simulate
the
first
whim
;
and
,
when
I
stretch
my
hand
out
cordially
,
such
bloom
and
light
and
bliss
rise
to
your
young
,
wistful
feature
<EOS>
,
I
have
much
ado
often
to
avoid
strain
you
then
and
there
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
talk
any
more
of
those
day
,
sir
,
"
I
interrupt
,
furtively
dash
away
some
tear
from
my
eye
;
his
language
be
torture
to
me
;
for
I
know
what
I
must
do
 
and
do
soon
 
and
all
these
reminiscence
,
and
these
revelation
of
his
feeling
only
make
my
work
more
difficult
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Jane
,
"
he
return
:
"
what
necessity
be
there
to
dwell
on
the
past
,
when
the
present
be
so
much
sure
 
the
Future
so
much
bright
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
shudder
to
hear
the
infatuate
assertion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
now
how
the
case
stand
 
<EOS>
do
you
not

continue

"
after
a
youth
and
manhood
pass
half
in
unutterable
misery

half
in
dreary
solitude

have
for
the
first
time
find
what
I
can
truly
love

I
have

lovely

a
fervent

solemn
passion

lean
to
you

draw
you
to

my
existence
about
you

kindle
in
pure

powerful
flame

fuse
you

in
one

It
be
because
I
feel
and
know
this
,
that
I
resolve
to
marry
you

<EOS>
to
tell
me
that
I
have
already

be
empty
mockery

you
know
now
that
I
have

<EOS>
a
hideous
demon

<EOS>
I
be
wrong
to
attempt
to
deceive
you
;
but
I
fear
a
stubbornness
that
exist
in
your
character

<EOS>
I
fear
early
instill
prejudice
:
I
want
to
have
you
safe
before
hazard
confidence
.
<EOS>
this
be
cowardly

I
should
have
appeal
to
your
nobleness

magnanimity
at
first

I

you
plainly

forebore
yet

<EOS>
I
lay
my
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
for
support
:
<EOS>
I
shake
,
I
fear
 
but
I
resolve

<EOS>
"
one
instant
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
give
one
glance
to
my
horrible
life
when
you
be
go

<EOS>
all
happiness
will
be
tear
away
with
you

<EOS>
what
then
be
leave
?
<EOS>
for
a
wife
I
have
but
the
maniac
upstairs
:
as
well
may
you
refer
me
to
some
corpse
in
yonder
churchyard
.
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
where
turn
for
a
companion
and
for
some
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
as
I
do
:
trust
in
God
and
yourself
.
<EOS>
believe
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
hope
to
meet
again
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
not
yield
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
condemn
me
to
live
wretched
and
to
die
accurse
?
"
<EOS>
His
voice
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
to
live
sinless
,
and
I
wish
you
to
die
tranquil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
snatch
love
and
innocence
from
me

<EOS>
You
fling
me
back
on
lust
for
a
passion
 
vice
for
an
occupation

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
no
more
assign
this
fate
to
you
than
I
grasp
at
it
for
myself
.
<EOS>
We
be
bear
to
strive
and
endure
 
you
as
well
as
I
:
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
will
forget
me
before
I
forget
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
me
a
liar
by
such
language
:
you
sully
my
honour
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
could
not
change
:
you
tell
me
to
my
face
I
shall
change
soon
.
<EOS>
and
what
a
distortion
in
your
judgment
,
what
a
perversity
in
your
idea
,
be
prove
by
your
conduct
!
<EOS>
be
it
well
to
drive
a
fellow

creature
to
despair
than
to
transgress
a
mere
human
law
,
no
man

injure
by
the
breach

<EOS>
for
you
have
neither
relative

offend
by

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
true
:
and
while
he
speak
my
very
conscience
and
reason
turn
traitor
against
me
,
and
charge
me
with
crime
in
resist
him

<EOS>
They
speak
almost
as
loud
as
feel
:
and
that
clamour
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
oh

comply

"
<EOS>
it
say

<EOS>
"
think
of
his
misery

soothe

save

tell

<EOS>
who

or
who

by
what
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
still
indomitable
be
the
reply
 
"
_
<EOS>
I

care
for

<EOS>
the
more
solitary

the

unsustained
I

the

I

<EOS>
I
will
keep
the

<EOS>
I
will
hold

<EOS>
law
and
principle
be
not

for

this

body

stringent

if
at

<EOS>
They
have
a

I

always
believe

if

it

quite
insane

preconceived

foregone

be
all
I

by

there
I
plant
my
foot

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
,
read
my
countenance
,
see
I
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
His
fury
be
work
to
the
high
:
he
must
yield
to
it
for
a
moment
,
whatever
follow
;
he
cross
the
floor
and
seize
my
arm
and
grasp
my
waist
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
devour
me
with
his
flaming
glance
:
<EOS>
physically
,
I
feel
,
at
the
moment
,
powerless
as
stubble
expose
to
the
draught
and
glow
of
a
furnace
:
mentally
,
I
still
possess
my
soul
,
and
with
it
the
certainty
of
ultimate
safety
.
<EOS>
the
soul
,
fortunately
,
have
an
interpreter
 
often
an
unconscious
,
but
still
a
truthful
interpreter
 
in
the
eye
.
<EOS>
My
eye
rise
to
his
;
and
while
I
look
in
his
fierce
face
I
give
an
involuntary
sigh
;
his
gripe
be
painful
,
and
my
over
-
tax
strength
almost
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
"
never

"
say
he
,
as
he
grind
his
tooth

"
never

so
frail

so
indomitable

<EOS>
(
and
he
shake
me
with
the
force
of
his
hold

)
<EOS>
"
I
could
bend
her
with
my
finger

thumb

and
what
good
would
it
do
if
I
bend
,
if
I
uptore

if
I
crush
her

<EOS>
consider
that
eye

consider
the

wild

free
thing
look
out

defy
me

with
more

with
a
stern
triumph

<EOS>
whatever

if

only
let
the
captive
loose

Conqueror
I
may
be

the
inmate
would
escape
to
heaven
before
I
could
call
myself
possessor
of
its
clay
dwelling

place

<EOS>
and
it
be
you

spirit
 
with
will

energy

and
virtue

purity
 
that
I
want

not
alone
your
brittle
frame

<EOS>
of
yourself
you
could
come
with
soft
flight

nestle
against
my

if
you

seize
against
your

you
will
elude
the
grasp
like
an
essence
 
you
will
vanish
ere

I
inhale
your

come

<EOS>
as

this

he
release
me
from

and
only
look
at
me

<EOS>
the
look
be
far
bad
to
resist
than
the
frantic
strain
:
only
an
idiot
,
however
,
would
have
succumb
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
dare
and
baffle
his
fury
;
I
must
elude
his
sorrow
<EOS>
:
I
retire
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

what
unutterable
pathos
be
in
his
voice
!
<EOS>
how
hard
it
be
to
reiterate
firmly
,

"

"
Mr.

withdraw
,
then
,
 
I
consent
;
but
remember
,
you
leave
me
here
in
anguish
.
<EOS>
go
up
to
your
own
room
;
think
over
all
I
have
say
,
and
,
Jane
,
cast
a
glance
on
my
suffering
 
think
of
me

<EOS>
He
turn
away
;
he
throw
himself
on
his
face
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

break
in
anguish
from

then
come
a
deep

strong
sob

<EOS>
I
have
already
gain
the
door
;
but
,
reader
,
I
walk
back
 
walk
back
as
determinedly
as
I
have
retreat

<EOS>
I
knelt
down
by
him
;
I
turn
his
face
from
the
cushion
to
me
;
I
kiss
his
cheek
;
I
smooth
his
hair
with
my
hand

<EOS>
"
God
bless

but
Jane
will
give
me
her
love
:
<EOS>
yes
 
nobly

generously

"
  
<EOS>
up
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
;
forth
flash
the
fire
from
his
eye
;
erect
he
spring
;
he
hold
his
arm
out
;
but
I
evade
the
embrace
,
and
at
once
quit
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell

<EOS>
"
be
the
cry
of
my
heart
as
I
leave

<EOS>
despair
add
,
"
farewell

"
     
<EOS>
that
night
I
never
think
to
sleep
;
but
a
slumber
fall
on
me
as
soon
as
I
lie
down
in
bed
.
<EOS>
I
be
transport
in
thought
to
the
scene
of
childhood
:
<EOS>
I
dreamt
<EOS>
I
lie
in
the
red
-
room
at
Gateshead
;
that
the
night
be
dark
,
and
my
mind
impress
with
strange
fear
.
<EOS>
the
light
that
long
ago
have
strike
me
into
syncope
,
recall
in
this
vision
,
seem
glidingly
to
mount
the
wall
,
and
tremblingly
to
pause
in
the
centre
of
the
obscure
ceiling
.
<EOS>
I
lift
up
my
head
to
look
:
the
roof
resolve
to
cloud
,
high
and
dim
;
the
gleam
be
such
as
the
moon
impart
to
vapour
<EOS>
she
be
about
to
sever
.
<EOS>
I
watch
her
come
 
watch
with
the
strange
anticipation
;
as
though
some
word
of
doom
be
to
be
write
on
her
disk
.
<EOS>
She
break
forth
as
never
moon
yet
burst
from
cloud
:
a
hand
first
penetrate
the
sable
fold
and
wave
them
away
;
then
,
not
a
moon
,
but
a
white
human
form
shine
in
the
azure
,
incline
a
glorious
brow
earthward
.
<EOS>
It
gaze
and
gaze
on
me
.
<EOS>
It
speak
to
my
spirit
:
<EOS>
immeasurably
distant
be
the
tone
,
yet
so
near
,
it
whisper
in
my
heart
    
"
My
daughter
,
flee
temptation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
mother
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
answer
after
I
have
wake
from
the
trance
-
like
dream
.
<EOS>
It
be
yet
night
,
but
July
night
be
short
:
soon
after
midnight
,
dawn
come
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
too
early
to
commence
the
task
I
have
to
fulfil
,
"
think
I.
I
rise
:
<EOS>
I
be
dress
;
for
I
have
take
off
nothing
but
my
shoe
.
<EOS>
I
know
where
to
find
in
my
drawer
some
linen
,
a
locket
,
a
ring
.
<EOS>
in
seek
these
article
,
I
encounter
the
bead
of
a
pearl
necklace
Mr.
Rochester
have
force
me
to
accept
a
few
day
ago
.
<EOS>
I
leave
that
;
it
be
not
mine
:
<EOS>
it
be
the
visionary
bride
's
who
have
melt
in
air
.
<EOS>
the
other
article
I
make
up
in
a
parcel
;
my
purse
,
contain
twenty
shilling
(
it
be
all
I
have
)
,
I
put
in
my
pocket
:
<EOS>
I
tie
on
my
straw
bonnet
,
pin
my
shawl
,
take
the
parcel
and
my
slipper
,
which
I
would
not
put
on
yet
,
and
steal
from
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
kind
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
<EOS>
"
I
whisper
,
as
I
glide
past
her
door
.
<EOS>
"
farewell
,
my
darling
Adele
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
as
I
glance
towards
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
no
thought
could
be
admit
of
enter
to
embrace
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
deceive
a
fine
ear
:
<EOS>
for
aught
I
know
it
may
now
be
listen
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
get
past
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
without
a
pause
;
but
my
heart
momentarily
stop
its
beat
at
that
threshold
,
my
foot
be
force
to
stop
also
.
<EOS>
no
sleep
be
there
:
the
inmate
be
walk
restlessly
from
wall
to
wall
;
and
again
and
again
he
sigh
while
I
listen
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
heaven
 
<EOS>
a
temporary
heaven
 
in
this
room
for
me
<EOS>
,
if
I
choose
:
I
have
but
to
go
in
and
to
say
    
"
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
will
love
you
and
live
with
you
through
life
till
death
,
"
and
a
fount
of
rapture
would
spring
to
my
lip
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
this
.
  
<EOS>
that
kind
master
,
who
could
not
sleep
now
,
be
wait
with
impatience
for
day
.
<EOS>
He
would
send
for
me
in
the
morning
;
I
should
be
go
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
me
seek
for
:
vainly
.
<EOS>
He
would
feel
himself
forsaken
;
his
love
reject
:
he
would
suffer
;
perhaps
grow
desperate
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
this
too
.
<EOS>
My
hand
move
towards
the
lock
:
I
catch
it
back
,
and
glide
on
.
  
<EOS>
drearily
I
wound
my
way
downstairs
<EOS>
:
I
know
what
I
have
to
do
,
and
I
do
it
mechanically
.
<EOS>
I
seek
the
key
of
the
side
-
door
in
the
kitchen
;
I
seek
,
too
,
a
phial
of
oil
and
a
feather
;
I
oil
the
key
and
the
lock
.
<EOS>
I
get
some
water
<EOS>
,
I
get
some
bread
:
for
perhaps
I
should
have
to
walk
far
;
and
my
strength
,
sorely
shake
of
late
,
must
not
break
down
.
<EOS>
all
this
I
do
without
one
sound
.
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
,
pass
out
,
shut
it
softly
.
<EOS>
dim
dawn
glimmer
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
the
great
gate
be
close
and
lock
;
but
a
wicket
in
one
of
them
be
only
latch
.
<EOS>
through
that
I
depart
:
it
,
too
,
I
shut
;
and
now
I
be
out
of
Thornfield
.
  
<EOS>
a
mile
off
,
beyond
the
field
,
lie
a
road
which
stretch
in
the
contrary
direction
to
Millcote
;
a
road
I
have
never
travel
,
but
often
notice
,
and
wonder
where
it
lead
:
thither
I
bend
my
step
.
<EOS>
no
reflection
be
to
be
allow
now
:
not
one
glance
be
to
be
cast
back
;
not
even
one
forward
.
<EOS>
not
one
thought
be
to
be
give
either
to
the
past
or
the
future
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
a
page
so
heavenly
sweet
 
<EOS>
so
deadly
sad
 
<EOS>
that
to
read
one
line
of
it
would
dissolve
my
courage
and
break
down
my
energy
.
<EOS>
the
last
be
an
awful
blank
:
something
like
the
world
when
the
deluge
be
go
by
.
  
<EOS>
I
skirt
field
,
and
hedge
,
and
lane
till
after
sunrise
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
a
lovely
summer
morning
:
<EOS>
I
know
my
shoe
,
which
I
have
put
on
when
I
leave
the
house
,
be
soon
wet
with
dew
.
<EOS>
but
I
look
neither
to
rise
sun
,
nor
smile
sky
,
nor
wakening
nature
.
<EOS>
He
who
be
take
out
to
pass
through
a
fair
scene
to
the
scaffold
,
think
not
of
the
flower
that
smile
on
his
road
,
but
of
the
block
and
axe
-
edge
;
of
the
disseverment
of
bone
and
vein
;
of
the
grave
gape
at
the
end
:
<EOS>
and
I
think
of
drear
flight
and
homeless
wandering
 
<EOS>
and
oh
!
<EOS>
with
agony
I
think
of
what
I
leave
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
him
now
 
in
his
room
 
watch
the
sunrise
;
hope
I
should
soon
come
to
say
I
would
stay
with
him
and
be
his
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
be
his
;
I
pant
to
return
:
it
be
not
too
late
;
I
could
yet
spare
him
the
bitter
pang
of
bereavement
.
<EOS>
as
yet
my
flight
,
I
be
sure
,
be
undiscovered
.
<EOS>
I
could
go
back
and
be
his
comforter
 
<EOS>
his
pride
;
his
redeemer
from
misery
,
perhaps
from
ruin
.
<EOS>
oh
,
that
fear
of
his
self
-
abandonment
 
far
bad
than
my
abandonment
 
<EOS>
how
it
goad
me
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
barb
arrow
-
head
in
my
breast
;
it
tear
me
when
I
try
to
extract
it
;
it
sicken
me
when
remembrance
thrust
it
farther
in
.
<EOS>
bird
begin
singe
in
brake
and
copse
:
bird
be
faithful
to
their
mate
;
bird
be
emblem
of
love
.
<EOS>
what
be
I
?
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
my
pain
of
heart
and
frantic
effort
of
principle
,
I
abhor
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
solace
from
self
-
approbation
:
none
even
from
self
-
respect
.
<EOS>
I
have
injure
 
wound
 
leave
my
master
.
<EOS>
I
be
hateful
in
my
own
eye
.
<EOS>
still
I
could
not
turn
,
nor
retrace
one
step
.
<EOS>
God
must
have
lead
me
on
.
<EOS>
as
to
my
own
will
or
conscience
,
impassione
grief
have
trample
one
and
stifle
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
be
weep
wildly
as
I
walk
along
my
solitary
way
:
fast
,
fast
I
go
like
one
delirious
.
<EOS>
a
weakness
,
begin
inwardly
,
extend
to
the
limb
,
seize
me
,
and
I
fall
:
<EOS>
I
lie
on
the
ground
some
minute
,
press
my
face
to
the
wet
turf
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
fear
 
or
hope
 
that
here
I
should
die
:
but
I
be
soon
up
;
crawl
forwards
on
my
hand
and
knee
,
and
then
again
raise
to
my
foot
 
as
eager
and
as
determined
as
ever
to
reach
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
get
there
,
I
be
force
to
sit
to
rest
me
under
the
hedge
;
and
while
I
sit
,
I
hear
wheel
,
and
see
a
coach
come
on
.
<EOS>
I
stand
up
and
lift
my
hand
;
it
stop
.
<EOS>
I
ask
where
it
be
go
:
the
driver
name
a
place
a
long
way
off
,
and
where
I
be
sure
Mr.
Rochester
have
no
connection
.
<EOS>
I
ask
for
what
sum
he
would
take
me
there
;
he
say
thirty
shilling
;
I
answer
I
have
but
twenty
;
well
,
he
would
try
to
make
it
do
.
<EOS>
He
further
give
me
leave
to
get
into
the
inside
,
as
the
vehicle
be
empty
:
I
enter
,
be
shut
in
,
and
it
roll
on
its
way
.
  
<EOS>
gentle
reader
,
may
you
never
feel
what
I
then
feel
!
<EOS>
May
your
eye
never
shed
such
stormy
,
scalding
,
heart
-
wrung
tear
as
pour
from
mine
.
<EOS>
May
you
never
appeal
to
Heaven
in
prayer
so
hopeless
and
so
agonised
as
in
that
hour
leave
my
lip
;
for
never
may
you
,
like
me
,
dread
to
be
the
instrument
of
evil
to
what
you
wholly
love
.
    
<EOS>
two
day
be
pass
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
summer
evening
;
the
coachman
have
set
me
down
at
a
place
call
Whitcross
;
he
could
take
me
no
farther
for
the
sum
I
have
give
,
and
I
be
not
possess
of
another
shilling
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
coach
be
a
mile
off
by
this
time
;
I
be
alone
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
I
discover
that
I
forget
to
take
my
parcel
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
coach
,
where
I
have
place
it
for
safety
;
there
it
remain
,
there
it
must
remain
;
and
now
,
I
be
absolutely
destitute
.
  
<EOS>
Whitcross
be
no
town
,
nor
even
a
hamlet
;
it
be
but
a
stone
pillar
set
up
where
four
road
meet
:
whitewash
,
I
suppose
,
to
be
more
obvious
at
a
distance
and
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
four
arm
spring
from
its
summit
:
the
near
town
to
which
these
point
be
,
accord
to
the
inscription
,
distant
ten
mile
;
the
farth
,
above
twenty
.
<EOS>
from
the
well
-
know
name
of
these
town
I
learn
in
what
county
I
have
light
;
a
north
-
midland
shire
,
dusk
with
moorland
,
ridge
with
mountain
:
this
I
see
.
<EOS>
there
be
great
moor
behind
and
on
each
hand
of
me
;
there
be
wave
of
mountain
far
beyond
that
deep
valley
at
my
foot
.
<EOS>
the
population
here
must
be
thin
,
and
I
see
no
passenger
on
these
road
:
they
stretch
out
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
 
white
,
broad
,
lonely
;
they
be
all
cut
in
the
moor
,
and
the
heather
grow
deep
and
wild
to
their
very
verge
.
<EOS>
yet
a
chance
traveller
may
pass
by
;
and
I
wish
no
eye
to
see
me
now
:
stranger
would
wonder
what
I
be
do
,
linger
here
at
the
sign
-
post
,
evidently
objectless
and
lose
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
question
:
I
could
give
no
answer
but
what
would
sound
incredible
and
excite
suspicion
.
<EOS>
not
a
tie
hold
me
to
human
society
at
this
moment
 
not
a
charm
or
hope
call
me
where
my
fellow
-
creature
be
 
none
that
see
me
would
have
a
kind
think
or
a
good
wish
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
relative
but
the
universal
mother
,
Nature
:
<EOS>
I
will
seek
her
breast
and
ask
repose
.
  
<EOS>
I
strike
straight
into
the
heath
;
I
hold
on
to
a
hollow
<EOS>
I
see
deeply
furrow
the
brown
moorside
;
I
wade
knee
-
deep
in
its
dark
growth
;
I
turn
with
its
turning
,
and
find
a
moss
-
blacken
granite
crag
in
a
hide
angle
,
I
sit
down
under
it
.
<EOS>
high
bank
of
moor
be
about
me
;
the
crag
protect
my
head
:
the
sky
be
over
that
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
pass
before
I
feel
tranquil
even
here
:
I
have
a
vague
dread
that
wild
cattle
may
be
near
,
or
that
some
sportsman
or
poacher
may
discover
me
.
<EOS>
if
a
gust
of
wind
sweep
the
waste
,
I
look
up
,
fear
it
be
the
rush
of
a
bull
;
if
a
plover
whistle
,
I
imagine
it
a
man
.
<EOS>
find
my
apprehension
unfounded
,
however
,
and
calm
by
the
deep
silence
that
reign
as
evening
decline
at
nightfall
,
I
take
confidence
.
<EOS>
as
yet
I
have
not
think
;
I
have
only
listen
,
watch
,
dread
;
now
I
regain
the
faculty
of
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
where
to
go
?
<EOS>
oh
,
intolerable
question
,
when
I
could
do
nothing
and
go
nowhere
!
 
<EOS>
when
a
long
way
must
yet
be
measure
by
my
weary
,
tremble
limb
before
I
could
reach
human
habitation
 
when
cold
charity
must
be
entreat
before
I
could
get
a
lodging
:
reluctant
sympathy
importune
,
<EOS>
almost
certain
repulse
incur
,
before
my
tale
could
be
listen
to
,
or
one
of
my
want
relieved
!
  
<EOS>
I
touch
the
heath
:
it
be
dry
,
and
yet
warm
with
the
heat
of
the
summer
day
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
the
sky
;
it
be
pure
:
a
kindly
star
twinkle
just
above
the
chasm
ridge
.
<EOS>
the
dew
fall
,
but
with
propitious
softness
;
no
breeze
whisper
.
<EOS>
nature
seem
to
me
benign
and
good
;
I
think
she
love
me
,
outcast
as
I
be
;
and
I
,
who
from
man
could
anticipate
only
mistrust
,
rejection
,
insult
,
clung
to
her
with
filial
fondness
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
,
at
least
,
I
would
be
her
guest
,
as
I
be
her
child
:
my
mother
would
lodge
me
without
money
and
without
price
.
<EOS>
I
have
one
morsel
of
bread
yet
:
the
remnant
of
a
roll
I
have
buy
in
a
town
we
pass
through
at
noon
with
a
stray
penny
 
<EOS>
my
last
coin
.
<EOS>
I
see
ripe
bilberry
gleam
here
and
there
,
like
jet
bead
in
the
heath
:
I
gather
a
handful
and
eat
them
with
the
bread
.
<EOS>
My
hunger
,
sharp
before
,
be
,
if
not
satisfied
,
appease
by
this
hermit
's
meal
.
<EOS>
I
say
my
evening
prayer
at
its
conclusion
,
and
then
choose
my
couch
.
  
<EOS>
{
I
say
my
evening
prayer
:
p311.jpg
}
  
<EOS>
beside
the
crag
the
heath
be
very
deep
:
when
I
lie
down
my
foot
be
bury
in
it
;
rise
high
on
each
side
,
it
leave
only
a
narrow
space
for
the
night
-
air
to
invade
.
<EOS>
I
fold
my
shawl
double
,
and
spread
it
over
me
for
a
coverlet
;
a
low
,
mossy
swell
be
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
thus
lodge
,
I
be
not
,
at
least
 
at
the
commencement
of
the
night
,
cold
.
  
<EOS>
My
rest
may
have
be
blissful
enough
,
only
a
sad
heart
break
it
.
<EOS>
It
plain
of
its
gape
wound
,
its
inward
bleeding
,
its
riven
chord
.
<EOS>
It
tremble
for
Mr.
Rochester
and
his
doom
;
it
bemoan
him
with
bitter
pity
;
it
demand
him
with
ceaseless
longing
;
and
,
impotent
as
a
bird
with
both
wing
break
,
it
still
quiver
its
shattered
pinion
in
vain
attempt
to
seek
him
.
  
<EOS>
wear
out
with
this
torture
of
thought
,
I
rise
to
my
knee
.
<EOS>
night
be
come
,
and
her
planet
be
rise
:
a
safe
,
still
night
:
too
serene
for
the
companionship
of
fear
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
God
be
everywhere
;
but
certainly
we
feel
His
presence
most
when
His
work
be
on
the
grand
scale
spread
before
us
;
and
it
be
in
the
unclouded
night
-
sky
,
where
His
world
wheel
their
silent
course
,
that
we
read
clear
<EOS>
His
infinitude
,
His
omnipotence
,
His
omnipresence
.
<EOS>
I
have
rise
to
my
knee
to
pray
for
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
look
up
,
I
,
with
tear
-
dimmed
eye
,
see
the
mighty
Milky-
way
.
<EOS>
remember
what
it
be
 
what
countless
system
there
sweep
space
like
a
soft
trace
of
light
 
<EOS>
I
feel
the
might
and
strength
of
God
.
<EOS>
sure
be
I
of
His
efficiency
to
save
what
He
have
make
:
convinced
I
grow
that
neither
earth
should
perish
,
nor
one
of
the
soul
it
treasure
.
<EOS>
I
turn
my
prayer
to
thanksgiving
:
the
Source
of
Life
be
also
the
Saviour
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
be
safe
;
he
be
God
's
,
and
by
God
would
he
be
guard
.
<EOS>
I
again
nestle
to
the
breast
of
the
hill
;
and
ere
long
in
sleep
forget
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
but
next
day
,
Want
come
to
me
pale
and
bare
.
<EOS>
long
after
the
little
bird
have
leave
their
nest
;
long
after
bee
have
come
in
the
sweet
prime
of
day
to
gather
the
heath
honey
before
the
dew
be
dry
 
when
the
long
morning
shadow
be
curtail
,
and
the
sun
fill
earth
and
sky
 
I
get
up
,
and
I
look
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
still
,
hot
,
perfect
day
!
<EOS>
what
a
golden
desert
this
spread
moor
!
<EOS>
everywhere
sunshine
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
live
in
it
and
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
lizard
run
over
the
crag
;
I
see
a
bee
busy
among
the
sweet
bilberry
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
at
the
moment
have
become
bee
or
lizard
,
that
I
may
have
find
fitting
nutriment
,
permanent
shelter
here
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
human
being
,
and
have
a
human
being
's
want
:
I
must
not
linger
where
there
be
nothing
to
supply
them
.
<EOS>
I
rise
;
I
look
back
at
the
bed
I
have
leave
.
<EOS>
hopeless
of
the
future
<EOS>
,
I
wish
but
this
 
that
my
maker
have
that
night
think
good
to
require
my
soul
of
me
while
I
sleep
;
and
that
this
weary
frame
,
absolve
by
death
from
further
conflict
with
fate
,
have
now
but
to
decay
quietly
,
and
mingle
in
peace
with
the
soil
of
this
wilderness
.
<EOS>
life
,
however
,
be
yet
in
my
possession
,
with
all
its
requirement
,
and
pain
,
and
responsibility
.
<EOS>
the
burden
must
be
carry
;
the
want
provide
for
;
the
suffering
endure
;
the
responsibility
fulfil
.
<EOS>
I
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
Whitcross
regain
,
I
follow
a
road
which
lead
from
the
sun
,
now
fervent
and
high
.
<EOS>
by
no
other
circumstance
have
I
will
to
decide
my
choice
.
<EOS>
I
walk
a
long
time
,
and
when
I
think
I
have
nearly
do
enough
,
and
may
conscientiously
yield
to
the
fatigue
that
almost
overpower
me
 
may
relax
this
force
action
,
and
,
sit
down
on
a
stone
I
see
near
,
submit
resistlessly
to
the
apathy
that
clog
heart
and
limb
 
I
hear
a
bell
chime
 
a
church
bell
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
and
there
,
amongst
the
romantic
hill
,
whose
change
and
aspect
I
have
cease
to
note
an
hour
ago
,
I
see
a
hamlet
and
a
spire
.
<EOS>
all
the
valley
at
my
right
hand
be
full
of
pasture-
field
,
and
cornfield
,
and
wood
;
and
a
glitter
stream
run
zig
-
zag
through
the
varied
shade
of
green
,
the
mellowing
grain
,
the
sombre
woodland
,
the
clear
and
sunny
lea
.
<EOS>
recall
by
the
rumbling
of
wheel
to
the
road
before
me
,
I
see
a
heavily
-
laden
waggon
labour
up
the
hill
,
and
not
far
beyond
be
two
cow
and
their
drover
.
<EOS>
human
life
and
human
labour
be
near
.
<EOS>
I
must
struggle
on
:
strive
to
live
and
bend
to
toil
like
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
o'clock
<EOS>
p.m.
I
enter
the
village
.
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
its
one
street
there
be
a
little
shop
with
some
cake
of
bread
in
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
covet
a
cake
of
bread
.
<EOS>
with
that
refreshment
I
could
perhaps
regain
a
degree
of
energy
:
without
it
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
the
wish
to
have
some
strength
and
some
vigour
return
to
me
as
soon
as
I
be
amongst
my
fellow
-
being
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
would
be
degrade
to
faint
with
hunger
on
the
causeway
of
a
hamlet
.
<EOS>
have
I
nothing
about
me
I
could
offer
in
exchange
for
one
of
these
roll
?
<EOS>
I
consider
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
small
silk
handkerchief
tie
round
my
throat
;
I
have
my
glove
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
tell
how
man
and
woman
in
extremity
of
destitution
proceed
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
either
of
these
article
would
be
accept
:
probably
they
would
not
;
but
I
must
try
.
  
<EOS>
I
enter
the
shop
:
a
woman
be
there
.
<EOS>
see
a
respectably
-
dress
person
,
a
lady
as
she
suppose
,
she
come
forward
with
civility
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
serve
me
?
<EOS>
I
be
seize
with
shame
:
my
tongue
would
not
utter
the
request
I
have
prepare
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
offer
her
the
half
-
wear
glove
,
the
creased
handkerchief
:
besides
,
I
feel
it
would
be
absurd
.
<EOS>
I
only
beg
permission
to
sit
down
a
moment
,
as
I
be
tired
.
<EOS>
disappoint
in
the
expectation
of
a
customer
,
she
coolly
accede
to
my
request
.
<EOS>
She
point
to
a
seat
;
I
sink
into
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sorely
urge
to
weep
;
but
conscious
how
unseasonable
such
a
manifestation
would
be
,
I
restrain
it
.
<EOS>
soon
I
ask
her
"
if
there
be
any
dressmaker
or
plain
-
workwoman
in
the
village
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
two
or
three
.
<EOS>
quite
as
many
as
there
be
employment
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflect
.
<EOS>
I
be
drive
to
the
point
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
bring
face
to
face
with
Necessity
.
<EOS>
I
stand
in
the
position
of
one
without
a
resource
,
without
a
friend
,
without
a
coin
.
<EOS>
I
must
do
something
.
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
I
must
apply
somewhere
.
<EOS>
where
?
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
know
of
any
place
in
the
neighbourhood
where
a
servant
be
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
;
she
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
chief
trade
in
this
place
?
<EOS>
what
do
most
of
the
people
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
some
be
farm
labourer
;
a
good
deal
work
at
Mr.
Oliver
's
needle
-
factory
,
and
at
the
foundry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Mr.
Oliver
employ
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
it
be
man
's
work
.
"
  
"
and
what
do
the
woman
do
?
"
  
"
I
knawn't
,
"
be
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
some
do
one
thing
,
and
some
another
.
<EOS>
poor
folk
mun
get
on
as
they
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
tired
of
my
question
:
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
what
claim
have
I
to
importune
her
?
<EOS>
a
neighbour
or
two
come
in
;
my
chair
be
evidently
want
.
<EOS>
I
take
leave
.
  
<EOS>
I
pass
up
the
street
,
look
as
I
go
at
all
the
house
to
the
right
hand
and
to
the
left
;
but
I
could
discover
no
pretext
,
nor
see
an
inducement
to
enter
any
.
<EOS>
I
ramble
round
the
hamlet
,
go
sometimes
to
a
little
distance
and
return
again
,
for
an
hour
or
more
.
<EOS>
much
exhausted
,
and
suffer
greatly
now
for
want
of
food
,
I
turn
aside
into
a
lane
and
sit
down
under
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
ere
many
minute
have
elapse
,
I
be
again
on
my
foot
,
however
,
and
again
search
something
 
<EOS>
a
resource
,
or
at
least
an
informant
.
<EOS>
a
pretty
little
house
stand
at
the
top
of
the
lane
,
with
a
garden
before
it
,
exquisitely
neat
and
brilliantly
bloom
.
<EOS>
I
stop
at
it
.
<EOS>
what
business
have
I
to
approach
the
white
door
or
touch
the
glitter
knocker
?
<EOS>
in
what
way
could
it
possibly
be
the
interest
of
the
inhabitant
of
that
dwell
to
serve
me
?
<EOS>
yet
I
draw
near
and
knock
.
<EOS>
a
mild
-
looking
,
cleanly
-
attire
young
woman
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
voice
as
may
be
expect
from
a
hopeless
heart
and
fainting
frame
 
a
voice
wretchedly
low
and
faltering
 
<EOS>
I
ask
if
a
servant
be
want
here
?
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
she
;
"
we
do
not
keep
a
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
tell
me
where
I
could
get
employment
of
any
kind
?
<EOS>
"
I
continue
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
stranger
,
without
acquaintance
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
want
some
work
:
no
matter
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
her
business
to
think
for
me
,
or
to
seek
a
place
for
me
:
<EOS>
besides
,
in
her
eye
,
how
doubtful
must
have
appear
my
character
,
position
,
tale
.
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
,
she
"
be
sorry
she
could
give
me
no
information
,
"
and
the
white
door
close
,
quite
gently
and
civilly
:
but
it
shut
me
out
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
hold
it
open
a
little
longer
,
I
believe
I
should
have
beg
a
piece
of
bread
;
for
I
be
now
bring
low
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
return
to
the
sordid
village
,
where
,
besides
,
no
prospect
of
aid
be
visible
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
long
rather
to
deviate
to
a
wood
I
see
not
far
off
,
which
appear
in
its
thick
shade
to
offer
invite
shelter
;
but
I
be
so
sick
,
so
weak
,
so
gnaw
with
nature
's
craving
,
instinct
keep
me
roam
round
abode
where
there
be
a
chance
of
food
.
<EOS>
Solitude
would
be
no
solitude
 
rest
no
rest
 
while
the
vulture
,
hunger
,
thus
sink
beak
and
talon
in
my
side
.
  
<EOS>
I
draw
near
house
;
I
leave
them
,
and
come
back
again
,
and
again
I
wander
away
:
always
repel
by
the
consciousness
of
have
no
claim
to
ask
 
no
right
to
expect
interest
in
my
isolate
lot
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
the
afternoon
advance
,
while
I
thus
wander
about
like
a
lost
and
starve
dog
.
<EOS>
in
cross
a
field
,
I
see
the
church
spire
before
me
:
I
hasten
towards
it
.
<EOS>
near
the
churchyard
,
and
in
the
middle
of
a
garden
,
stand
a
well
-
build
though
small
house
,
which
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
be
the
parsonage
.
<EOS>
I
remember
that
stranger
who
arrive
at
a
place
where
they
have
no
friend
,
and
who
want
employment
,
sometimes
apply
to
the
clergyman
for
introduction
and
aid
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
clergyman
's
function
to
help
 
at
least
with
advice
 
those
who
wish
to
help
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
something
like
a
right
to
seek
counsel
here
.
<EOS>
renew
then
my
courage
,
and
gather
my
feeble
remain
of
strength
,
I
push
on
.
<EOS>
I
reach
the
house
,
and
knock
at
the
kitchen
-
door
.
<EOS>
an
old
woman
open
:
I
ask
be
this
the
parsonage
?
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
clergyman
in
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
he
be
in
soon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

he
be
go
from
home

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
a
distance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
far
 
happen
three
mile
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
call
away
by
the
sudden
death
of
his
father
:
he
be
at
Marsh
End
now
,
and
would
very
likely
stay
there
a
fortnight
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
lady
of
the
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
there
be
naught
but
her
,
and
she
be
housekeeper
;
"
and
of
her
,
reader
,
I
could
not
bear
to
ask
the
relief
for
want
of
which
I
be
sink
;
I
could
not
yet
beg
;
and
again
I
crawl
away
.
  
<EOS>
once
more
I
take
off
my
handkerchief
 
once
more
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
cake
of
bread
in
the
little
shop
.
<EOS>
oh
,
for
but
a
crust
!
<EOS>
for
but
one
mouthful
to
allay
the
pang
of
famine
!
<EOS>
instinctively
I
turn
my
face
again
to
the
village
;
I
find
the
shop
again
,
and
I
go
in
;
and
though
other
be
there
besides
the
woman
I
venture
the
request
 
<EOS>
"
Would
she
give
me
a
roll
for
this
handkerchief
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
me
with
evident
suspicion
:
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
she
never
sell
stuff
<EOS>
i
'
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
almost
desperate
,
I
ask
for
half
a
cake
;
she
again
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
how
could
she
tell
where
I
have
get
the
handkerchief
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
she
take
my
glove
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
what
could
she
do
with
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
reader
,
it
be
not
pleasant
to
dwell
on
these
detail
.
<EOS>
some
say
there
be
enjoyment
in
look
back
to
painful
experience
past
;
but
at
this
day
I
can
scarcely
bear
to
review
the
time
to
which
I
allude
:
<EOS>
the
moral
degradation
,
blent
with
the
physical
suffering
,
form
too
distress
a
recollection
ever
to
be
willingly
dwell
on
.
<EOS>
I
blame
none
of
those
who
repulse
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
be
what
be
to
be
expect
,
and
what
could
not
be
help
:
an
ordinary
beggar
be
frequently
an
object
of
suspicion
;
a
well
-
dress
beggar
inevitably
so
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
what
I
beg
be
employment
;
but
whose
business
be
it
to
provide
me
with
employment
?
<EOS>
not
,
certainly
,
that
of
person
who
see
me
then
for
the
first
time
,
and
who
know
nothing
about
my
character
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
woman
who
would
not
take
my
handkerchief
in
exchange
for
her
bread
,
why
,
she
be
right
,
if
the
offer
appear
to
her
sinister
or
the
exchange
unprofitable
.
<EOS>
let
me
condense
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
sick
of
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
before
dark
I
pass
a
farm
-
house
,
at
the
open
door
of
which
the
farmer
be
sit
,
eat
his
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
.
<EOS>
I
stop
and
say
    
"
Will
you
give
me
a
piece
of
bread
?
<EOS>
for
I
be
very
hungry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
cast
on
me
a
glance
of
surprise
;
but
without
answer
,
he
cut
a
thick
slice
from
his
loaf
,
and
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
he
do
not
think
I
be
a
beggar
,
but
only
an
eccentric
sort
of
lady
,
who
have
take
a
fancy
to
his
brown
loaf
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
out
of
sight
of
his
house
,
I
sit
down
and
eat
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
hope
to
get
a
lodging
under
a
roof
,
and
seek
it
in
the
wood
I
have
before
allude
to
.
<EOS>
but
my
night
be
wretched
,
my
rest
break
:
<EOS>
the
ground
be
damp
,
the
air
cold
:
besides
,
intruder
pass
near
me
more
than
once
,
and
I
have
again
and
again
to
change
my
quarter
;
no
sense
of
safety
or
tranquillity
befriend
me
.
<EOS>
towards
morning
it
rain
;
the
whole
of
the
follow
day
be
wet
.
<EOS>
do
not
ask
me
,
reader
,
to
give
a
minute
account
of
that
day
;
as
before
,
I
seek
work
;
as
before
,
I
be
repulse
;
as
before
,
I
starve
;
but
once
do
food
pass
my
lip
.
<EOS>
at
the
door
of
a
cottage
I
see
a
little
girl
about
to
throw
a
mess
of
cold
porridge
into
a
pig
trough
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
{
"
Will
you
give
me
that
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
:

}
  
<EOS>
She
stare
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
mother
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
"
there
be
a
woman
want
me
to
give
her
these
porridge
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
lass
,
"
reply
a
voice
within
,
"
give
it
her
if
she
be
a
beggar
.
<EOS>
t
'
pig
do
not
want
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
empty
the
stiffened
mould
into
my
hand
,
and
I
devour
it
ravenously
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
wet
twilight
deepen
,
I
stop
in
a
solitary
bridle
-
path
,
which
I
have
be
pursue
an
hour
or
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
strength
be
quite
fail
me
,
"
I
say
in
a
soliloquy
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
I
can
not
go
much
farther
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
be
an
outcast
again
this
night
?
<EOS>
while
the
rain
descend
so
,
must
I
lay
my
head
on
the
cold
,
drench
ground
?
<EOS>
I
fear
I
can
not
do
otherwise
:
for
who
will
receive
me
?
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
very
dreadful
,
with
this
feeling
of
hunger
,
faintness
,
chill
,
and
this
sense
of
desolation
 
this
total
prostration
of
hope
.
<EOS>
in
all
likelihood
,
though
,
I
should
die
before
morning
.
<EOS>
and
why
can
not
I
reconcile
myself
to
the
prospect
of
death
?
<EOS>
why
do
I
struggle
to
retain
a
valueless
life
?
<EOS>
because
I
know
,
or
believe
,
Mr.
Rochester
be
live
:
and
then
,
to
die
of
want
and
cold
be
a
fate
to
which
nature
can
not
submit
passively
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Providence
!
<EOS>
sustain
me
a
little
longer
!
<EOS>
aid
!
 
<EOS>
direct
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
glazed
eye
wander
over
the
dim
and
misty
landscape
.
<EOS>
I
see
I
have
stray
far
from
the
village
:
it
be
quite
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
the
very
cultivation
surround
it
have
disappear
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
by
cross
-
way
and
by-
path
,
once
more
draw
near
the
tract
of
moorland
;
and
now
<EOS>
,
only
a
few
field
,
almost
as
wild
and
unproductive
as
the
heath
from
which
they
be
scarcely
reclaim
,
lie
between
me
and
the
dusky
hill
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
would
rather
die
yonder
than
in
a
street
or
on
a
frequented
road
,
"
I
reflect
.
"
<EOS>
and
far
better
that
crow
and
raven
 
if
any
raven
there
be
in
these
region
 
should
pick
my
flesh
from
my
bone
,
than
that
they
should
be
prisone
in
a
workhouse
coffin
and
moulder
in
a
pauper
's
grave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
the
hill
,
then
,
I
turn
.
<EOS>
I
reach
it
.
<EOS>
It
remain
now
only
to
find
a
hollow
where
I
could
lie
down
,
and
feel
at
least
hide
,
if
not
secure
.
<EOS>
but
all
the
surface
of
the
waste
look
level
.
<EOS>
It
show
no
variation
but
of
tint
:
green
,
where
rush
and
moss
overgrow
the
marsh
;
black
,
where
the
dry
soil
bore
only
heath
.
<EOS>
dark
as
it
be
get
,
I
could
still
see
these
change
,
though
<EOS>
but
as
mere
alternation
of
light
and
shade
;
for
colour
have
fade
with
the
daylight
.
  
<EOS>
My
eye
still
rove
over
the
sullen
swell
and
along
the
moor
-
edge
,
vanish
amidst
the
wildest
scenery
,
when
at
one
dim
point
,
far
in
among
the
marsh
and
the
ridge
,
a
light
spring
up
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
an
_
ignis
fatuus
_
,
"
be
my
first
thought
;
and
I
expect
it
would
soon
vanish
.
<EOS>
It
burn
on
,
however
,
quite
steadily
,
neither
recede
nor
advance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
it
,
then
,
a
bonfire
just
kindle
?
<EOS>
"
I
question
.
<EOS>
I
watch
to
see
whether
it
would
spread
:
but
no
;
as
it
do
not
diminish
,
so
it
do
not
enlarge
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
a
candle
in
a
house
,
"
I
then
conjecture
;
"
but
if
so
,
I
can
never
reach
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
much
too
far
away
:
and
be
it
within
a
yard
of
me
,
what
would
it
avail
?
<EOS>
I
should
but
knock
at
the
door
to
have
it
shut
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
I
sink
down
where
I
stand
,
and
hide
my
face
against
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
lie
still
a
while
:
the
night
-
wind
sweep
over
the
hill
and
over
me
,
and
die
moan
in
the
distance
;
the
rain
fall
fast
,
wet
me
afresh
to
the
skin
.
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
I
but
have
stiffen
to
the
still
frost
 
the
friendly
numbness
of
death
 
it
may
have
pelt
on
;
I
should
not
have
feel
it
;
but
my
yet
live
flesh
shudder
at
its
chilling
influence
.
<EOS>
I
rise
ere
long
.
  
<EOS>
the
light
be
yet
there
,
shine
dim
but
constant
through
the
rain
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
walk
again
:
I
drag
my
exhausted
limb
slowly
towards
it
.
<EOS>
It
lead
me
aslant
over
the
hill
,
through
a
wide
bog
,
which
would
have
be
impassable
in
winter
,
and
be
splashy
and
shake
even
now
,
in
the
height
of
summer
.
<EOS>
here
I
fall
twice
;
but
as
often
I
rise
and
rally
my
faculty
.
<EOS>
this
light
be
my
forlorn
hope
:
I
must
gain
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
cross
the
marsh
,
I
see
a
trace
of
white
over
the
moor
.
<EOS>
I
approach
it
;
it
be
a
road
or
a
track
:
it
lead
straight
up
to
the
light
,
which
now
beam
from
a
sort
of
knoll
,
amidst
a
clump
of
tree
 
fir
,
apparently
,
from
what
I
could
distinguish
of
the
character
of
their
form
and
foliage
through
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
My
star
vanish
as
I
draw
near
:
some
obstacle
have
intervene
between
me
and
it
.
<EOS>
I
put
out
my
hand
to
feel
the
dark
mass
before
me
:
I
discriminate
the
rough
stone
of
a
low
wall
 
above
it
,
something
like
palisade
,
and
within
,
a
high
and
prickly
hedge
.
<EOS>
I
grope
on
.
<EOS>
again
a
whitish
object
gleam
before
me
:
it
be
a
gate
 
<EOS>
a
wicket
;
it
move
on
its
hinge
as
I
touch
it
.
<EOS>
on
each
side
stand
a
sable
bush
-
holly
or
yew
.
  
<EOS>
enter
the
gate
and
pass
the
shrub
,
the
silhouette
of
a
house
rise
to
view
,
black
,
low
,
and
rather
long
;
but
the
guide
light
shine
nowhere
.
<EOS>
all
be
obscurity
.
<EOS>
be
the
inmate
retire
to
rest
?
<EOS>
I
fear
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
in
seek
the
door
,
I
turn
an
angle
:
there
shoot
out
the
friendly
gleam
again
,
from
the
lozenged
pane
of
a
very
small
lattice
window
,
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
,
make
still
small
by
the
growth
of
ivy
or
some
other
creep
plant
,
whose
leave
cluster
thick
over
the
portion
of
the
house
wall
in
which
it
be
set
.
<EOS>
the
aperture
be
so
screened
and
narrow
,
that
curtain
or
shutter
have
be
deem
unnecessary
;
and
when
I
stoop
down
and
put
aside
the
spray
of
foliage
shoot
over
it
,
I
could
see
all
within
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
clearly
a
room
with
a
sanded
floor
,
clean
scour
;
a
dresser
of
walnut
,
with
pewter
plate
range
in
row
,
reflect
the
redness
and
radiance
of
a
glowing
peat
-
fire
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
a
clock
,
a
white
deal
table
,
some
chair
.
<EOS>
the
candle
,
whose
ray
have
be
my
beacon
,
burn
on
the
table
;
and
by
its
light
an
elderly
woman
,
somewhat
rough
-
look
,
but
scrupulously
clean
,
like
all
about
her
,
be
knit
a
stocking
.
  
<EOS>
I
notice
these
object
cursorily
only
 
in
them
there
be
nothing
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
a
group
of
more
interest
appear
near
the
hearth
,
sit
still
amidst
the
rosy
peace
and
warmth
suffuse
it
.
<EOS>
two
young
,
graceful
woman
 
lady
in
every
point
 
sit
,
one
in
a
low
rocking
-
chair
,
the
other
on
a
low
stool
;
both
wear
deep
mourning
of
crape
and
bombazeen
,
which
sombre
garb
singularly
set
off
very
fair
neck
and
face
:
a
large
old
pointer
dog
rest
its
massive
head
on
the
knee
of
one
girl
 
in
the
lap
of
the
other
be
cushion
a
black
cat
.
  
<EOS>
a
strange
place
be
this
humble
kitchen
for
such
occupant
!
<EOS>
who
be
they
?
<EOS>
They
could
not
be
the
daughter
of
the
elderly
person
at
the
table
;
for
she
look
like
a
rustic
,
and
they
be
all
delicacy
and
cultivation
.
<EOS>
I
have
nowhere
see
such
face
as
theirs
:
and
yet
,
as
I
gaze
on
them
,
I
seem
intimate
with
every
lineament
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
them
handsome
 
<EOS>
they
be
too
pale
and
grave
for
the
word
:
<EOS>
as
they
each
bend
over
a
book
,
they
look
thoughtful
almost
to
severity
.
<EOS>
a
stand
between
them
support
a
second
candle
and
two
great
volume
,
to
which
they
frequently
refer
,
compare
them
,
seemingly
,
with
the
small
book
they
hold
in
their
hand
,
like
people
consult
a
dictionary
to
aid
them
in
the
task
of
translation
.
<EOS>
this
scene
be
as
silent
as
if
all
the
figure
have
be
shadow
and
the
firelit
apartment
a
picture
<EOS>
:
so
hush
be
it
,
I
could
hear
the
cinder
fall
from
the
grate
,
the
clock
tick
in
its
obscure
corner
;
and
I
even
fancy
I
could
distinguish
the
click
-
click
of
the
woman
's
knitting
-
needle
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
a
voice
break
the
strange
stillness
at
last
,
it
be
audible
enough
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
listen
,
Diana
,
"
say
one
of
the
absorb
student
;
"
Franz
and
old
Daniel
be
together
in
the
night
-
time
,
and
Franz
be
tell
a
dream
from
which
he
have
awaken
in
terror
 
listen
!
"
<EOS>
and
in
a
low
voice
she
read
something
,
of
which
not
one
word
be
intelligible
to
me
;
for
it
be
in
an
unknown
tongue
 
neither
French
nor
latin
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
greek
or
german
I
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
strong
,
"
she
say
,
when
she
have
finish
:
"
I
relish
it
.
"
<EOS>
the
other
girl
,
who
have
lift
her
head
to
listen
to
her
sister
,
repeat
,
while
she
gaze
at
the
fire
,
a
line
of
what
have
be
read
.
<EOS>
at
a
later
day
,
I
know
the
language
and
the
book
;
therefore
,
I
will
here
quote
the
line
:
though
,
when
I
first
hear
it
,
it
be
only
like
a
stroke
on
sound
brass
to
me
 
convey
no
meaning
:
    
"
<EOS>
"
Da
trat
hervor
Einer
,
anzusehen
wie
die

Nacht
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
!
good
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
while
her
dark
and
deep
eye
sparkle
.
<EOS>
"
there
you
have
a
dim
and
mighty
archangel
fitly
set
before
you
!
<EOS>
the
line
be
worth
a
hundred
page
of
fustian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

"
I

both
be
again
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"

ask
the
old
woman

up
from
her
knitting

<EOS>
"
yes

Hannah

far
large

England

ye

I
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
could
probably
tell
something
of
what
they

not
all
 
for
we

clever

you

us

Hannah

<EOS>
We

us

<EOS>

what
good

<EOS>

We
mean
to
teach
it
some

at

the

I
be
tired

<EOS>
Mary

be
you

<EOS>
"
mortally
:
after

it

tough

away

It

such
a

crabbed

glorious
Deutsch

I
wonder
when
St.
John
will
come
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
surely
he
will
not
be
long
now

it

ten

look

watch

draw
from

<EOS>
It
rain
fast

Hannah

will
you
have
the
goodness
to
look
at

fire
in

<EOS>
the
woman
rise
:
<EOS>
she
open
a
door
,
through
which
I
dimly
see
a
passage
:
soon
I
hear
her
stir
a
fire
in
an
inner
room

she
presently
come
back

<EOS>
"
ah

<EOS>
say
she

"
it

<EOS>
She
wipe
her
eye
with
her
apron

the

look
sad
now

continue
Hannah
:
"
we

not

and
then
,
nobody

<EOS>
"
You

inquire

He

I
could
not

where
the
old
servant
(

I
now
conclude
her
to

the
difference

both
be
fair
complexioned

slenderly

both

have

dark

other

there
be
a
difference
in
their
style
of
wear

;
Mary
's
pale
brown
lock
be
part
and
braid
smooth
:
Diana
's
duskier
tress
cover
her
neck
with
thick
curl

"
Ye'll
want
your
supper

sure

Hannah
;

so
will
Mr.
St.
John

come
in

<EOS>
and
she
proceed
to
prepare
the
meal
.
<EOS>
the
lady
rise
;
they
seem
about
to
withdraw
to
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
till
this
moment
,
I
have
be
so
intent
on
watch
them
,
their
appearance
and
conversation
have
excite
in
me
<EOS>
so
keen
an
interest
<EOS>
,
I
have
half
-
forget
my
own
wretched
position
:
now
it
recur
to
me
.
<EOS>
more
desolate
,
more
desperate
than
ever
,
it
seem
from
contrast
.
<EOS>
and
how
impossible
do
it
appear
to
touch
the
inmate
of
this
house
with
concern
on
my
behalf
;
to
make
them
believe
in
the
truth
of
my
want
and
woe
 
to
induce
them
to
vouchsafe
a
rest
for
my
wandering
!
<EOS>
as
I
grope
out
the
door
,
and
knock
at
it
hesitatingly
,
I
feel
that
last
idea
to
be
a
mere
chimera

<EOS>
Hannah
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want

she
inquire
,
in
a
voice
of
surprise
,
as
she
survey
me
by
the
light
of
the
candle
she
hold

<EOS>
"
May
I
speak
to
your
mistress

presently
I
stand
within

drooping

some
bread

it
to
my
lip

<EOS>
Her
face
be
near

I

there
be
pity
in

I
feel
sympathy
in
her
hurried
breathing

<EOS>
in
her
simple

too

the

balm

like
emotion

remove
my

bonnet

my

taste
what

eagerly
soon

I

I

Jane
Elliott

<EOS>
anxious
as
ever

discovery

I

resolve

<EOS>

account

you
give

<EOS>
somehow
,
now
that
I
have
once
cross
the
threshold
of
this
house
,
and
once
be
bring
face
to
face
with
its
owner
,
I
feel
no
longer
outcast
,
vagrant
,
and
disown
by
the
wide
world

<EOS>
I
dare
to
put
off
the
mendicant
 
to
resume
my
natural
manner
and
character

<EOS>
I
begin
once
more
to
know
myself
;
and
when
Mr.
St.
John
demand
an
account
 
which
at
present
I
be
far
too
weak
to
render
 
<EOS>
I
say
after
a
brief
pause
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
can
give
you
no
detail
to

night

<EOS>

he
,

you

<EOS>
"
nothing

I

My
strength
suffice
for

short
answer

Diana
take
the
word
    
"
do
you
mean

"
she
ask
,
"
that
we
have
now

you
what
aid
you
require

and
that
we
may
dismiss
you
to
the
moor
and
the
rainy
night
?

"
  
<EOS>
I
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
I
think
,
a
remarkable
countenance
,
instinct
both
with
power
and
goodness
.
<EOS>
I
take
sudden
courage
.
<EOS>
answer
her
compassionate
gaze
with
a
smile
,
I
say
 
"
I
will
trust
you
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
masterless
and
stray
dog

I
know
that
you

not
turn
me
from
your
hearth

night

as
it
be

I
really
have
no
fear

with
me

for
me
as
you
like

but
excuse
me
from
much
discourse
 
<EOS>
my
breath
be
short
 
<EOS>
I
feel
a
spasm
when
I
speak

all
three

me
,

all
three

Hannah
,
"
say
Mr.
St.
John
,
at
last
,
"
let
her
sit
there
at
present
,
and
ask
her
no
question
;
in
ten
minute
more
,
give
her
the
remainder
of
that
milk
and
bread
.
<EOS>
Mary
and
Diana
,
let
us
go
into
the
parlour
and
talk
the
matter
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
withdraw
.
<EOS>
very
soon
one
of
the
lady
return
 
I
could
not
tell
which
.
<EOS>
a
kind
of
pleasant
stupor
be
steal
over
me
as
I
sit
by
the
genial
fire
.
<EOS>
in
an
undertone
she
give
some
direction
to
Hannah
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
with
the
servant
's
aid
,
I
contrive
to
mount
a
staircase
;
my
dripping
clothe
be
remove
;
soon
a
warm
,
dry
bed
receive
me
.
<EOS>
I
thank
God
 
experienced
amidst
unutterable
exhaustion
a
glow
of
grateful
joy
 
and
sleep
.
    
<EOS>
the
recollection
of
about
three
day
and
night
succeed
this
be
very
dim
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
can
recall
some
sensation
feel
in
that
interval
;
but
few
thought
frame
,
and
no
action
perform
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
in
a
small
room
and
in
a
narrow
bed
.
<EOS>
to
that
bed
I
seem
to
have
grow
;
I
lie
on
it
motionless
as
a
stone
;
and
to
have
tear
me
from
it
would
have
be
almost
to
kill
me
.
<EOS>
I
take
no
note
of
the
lapse
of
time
 
of
the
change
from
morning
to
noon
,
from
noon
to
evening
.
<EOS>
I
observe
when
any
one
enter
or
leave
the
apartment
:
I
could
even
tell
who
they
be
;
I
could
understand
what
be
say
when
the
speaker
stand
near
to
me
;
but
I
could
not
answer
;
to
open
my
lip
or
move
my
limb
be
equally
impossible
.
<EOS>
Hannah
,
the
servant
,
be
my
most
frequent
visitor
.
<EOS>
Her
come
disturb
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
feeling
that
she
wish
me
away
:
that
she
do
not
understand
me
or
my
circumstance
;
that
she
be
prejudice
against
me
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
appear
in
the
chamber
once
or
twice
a
day
.
<EOS>
They
would
whisper
sentence
of
this
sort
at
my
bedside
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
<EOS>
very
well
we
take
her
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
she
would
certainly
have
be
find
dead
at
the
door
in
the
morning
have
she
be
leave
out
all
night
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
she
have
go
through
?

<EOS>

Mr.

come
but
once
:
he
look
at
me
,
and
say
my
state
of
lethargy
be
the
result
of
reaction
from
excessive
and
protract
fatigue
.
<EOS>
He
pronounce
it
needless

for

nature

be
sure

would

leave

<EOS>
He
say

must
sleep
torpid
a

rapid
enough

commence

these
opinion
he
deliver
in
a
few
word
,
in
a
quiet
,
low
voice
;
and
add
,
after
a
pause
,
in
the
tone
of
a
man
little
accustomed
to
expansive
comment
,
"

an
unusual

You

line

poison

to
rise

what

I
put
on

<EOS>
only
my
damp

I
have
sleep
on

fall
in

loose

calmly

<EOS>
Diana

cooing

She

eye

Her

<EOS>
Mary

more
distant

<EOS>
Diana
look
and
speak
with
a
certain
authority

she
have
a
will

evidently

<EOS>
It
be
my
nature

feel
pleasure
in
yield
to
an
authority

to
bend

my

It

<EOS>
Mary

because
at

moorland
home

prepare
our

inclined

<EOS>
She
close
the
door
,
leave
me
solus
with
Mr.
St.
John
,
who
sit
opposite
,
a
book
or
newspaper
in
his

<EOS>
I
examine
first
,
the
parlour
,
and
then
its
occupant

<EOS>
the
parlour
be
rather
a
small
room
,
very
plainly
furnished
,
yet
comfortable
,
because
clean
and
neat
.
<EOS>
the
old
-
fashioned
chair
be
very
bright
,
and
the
walnut
-
wood
table
be
like
a
looking

glass
.
<EOS>
a
few
strange
,
antique
portrait
of
the
man
and
woman
of
other
day
decorate
the
stain
wall
;
a
cupboard
with
glass
door
contain
some
book
and
an
ancient
set
of
china
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
superfluous
ornament
in
the
room
 
not
one
modern
piece
of
furniture
,
save
a
brace
of
workbox
and
a
lady
's
desk
in
rosewood
,
which
stand
on
a
side
-
table
:
everything
 
include
the
carpet
and
curtain
 
<EOS>
look
at
once
well
worn
and
well
save
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
 
sit
as
still
as
one
of
the
dusty
picture
on
the
wall
,
keep
his
eye
fix
on
the
page
he
peruse
,
and
his
lip
mutely
seal
 
be
easy
enough
to
examine
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
a
statue
instead
of
a
man
,
he
could
not
have
be
easy
.
<EOS>
He
be
young
 
perhaps
from
twenty-
eight
to
thirty
 
tall
,
slender
;
his
face
rivet
the
eye
;
it
be
like
a
greek
face
,
very
pure
in
outline
:
quite
a
straight
,
classic
nose
;
quite
an
athenian
mouth
and
chin
.
<EOS>
It
be
seldom
,
indeed
,
an
english
face
come
so
near
the
antique
model
as
do
his
.
<EOS>
He
may
well
be
a
little
shocked
at
the
irregularity
of
my
lineament
,
his
own
being
so
harmonious
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
large
and
blue
,
with
brown
lash
;
his
high
forehead
,
colourless
as
ivory
,
be
partially
streak
over
by
careless
lock
of
fair
hair
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
gentle
delineation
,
be
it
not
,
reader
?
<EOS>
yet
he
whom
it
describe
scarcely
impress
one
with
the
idea
of
a
gentle
,
a
yield
,
an
impressible
,
or
even
of
a
placid
nature
.
<EOS>
quiescent
as
he
now
sit
,
there
be
something
about
his
nostril
,
his
mouth
,
his
brow
,
which
,
to
my
perception
,
indicate
element
within
either
restless
,
or
hard
,
or
eager
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
to
me
one
word
,
nor
even
direct
to
me
one
glance
,
till
his
sister
return
.
<EOS>
Diana
,
as
she
pass
in
and
out
,
in
the
course
of
prepare
tea

bring
me
a
little
cake
,
bake
on
the
top
of
the
oven
.
  
<EOS>
"
eat
that
<EOS>
now
,
"
she
say
:
"
you
must
be
hungry

<EOS>
Hannah
say
you
have
have
nothing
but
some
gruel
since
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
do
not
refuse
it
,
for
my
appetite
be
awaken
and
keen
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
now
close
his
book
,
approach
the
table
,
and
,
as
he
take
a
seat
,
fix
his
blue
pictorial
-
looking
eye
full
on
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
unceremonious
directness
,
a
search
,
decide
steadfastness
in
his
gaze
now
,
which
tell
that
intention
,

hitherto

the
stranger

<EOS>
"
You

.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be

It

my

my

by
instinct
 
ever
to
meet
the
brief
with
brevity
,
the
direct
with
plainness
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
for
you
that
a
low
fever

force
you

be
my
very
clumsily-
contrived
,
unpolished
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
say
coolly
:
"
when
you
have
indicate
to
us
the
residence
of
your
friend

we
can
write
to
them
,
and
you

be
restore
to
home

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
I
must
plainly
tell
you
,
be
out
of
my
power
to
do
;
be
absolutely
without
home
and
friend
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
three
look
at
me
,
but
not
distrustfully
;
I
feel
there
be
no
suspicion
in
their
glance
:
there
be
more
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
speak
particularly
of
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
St.
John
's
eye
,
though
clear
enough
in
a
literal
sense
,
in
a
figurative
one
be
difficult
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
use
them
rather
as
instrument
to
search
other
people
's
thought
,
than
as
agent
to
reveal
his
own
:
the
which
combination
of
keenness
and
reserve
be
considerably
more
calculated
to
embarrass
than
to
encourage
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
say
,
"
he
ask
,
"
that
you
be
completely
isolate
from
every
connection
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
not
a
tie
link
me
to
any
live
thing

not
a
claim

do
I
possess
to
admittance
under
any
roof

England

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
most
singular
position
at
your
age

<EOS>
here
I
see
his
glance
direct
to
my
hand
,
which
be
fold
on
the
table
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
he
seek
there
:
his
word
soon
explain
the
quest
.

"
You

I

a

glow
mount
to
my

for
bitter
and
agitate
recollection
be
awaken
by
the
allusion
to
marriage

They
all
see
the
embarrassment
and
the
emotion

<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
relieve
me
by
turn
their
eye
elsewhere
than
to
my
crimson
visage

the
cold

sterner

continue
to
gaze

Mary
in

low

lean
over

a
second
firm

piercing

the

I

it

down
now

"
  
<EOS>
I
give
an
involuntary
half
start
at
hear
the
_
alias

:
I
have
forget
my
new
name
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
,
whom
nothing
seem
to
escape

notice
it
at
once

<EOS>
"
You
say
your
name
be
Jane
Elliott

<EOS>
he
observe
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
say
so
;

it
be
the
name
by
which
I
think
it
expedient
to
be
call
at
present

it
be
not
my

when
I
hear

it

strange

<EOS>
"
Your

you
will
not

no

You

let
her

at
peace
a

when
St.

have
muse
a

moment
he
recommence
as
imperturbably

with
as
much
acuman
as
ever

<EOS>
"
You
would
not

I
do

I

already

so

show
me
how

how

seek
work

all
I

You

repeat
Mary

in
the
tone

undemonstrative

"
My

you

<EOS>
He
now
resume
the
book
with
which
he
have
be
occupy
before
tea
.
<EOS>
I
soon
withdraw
,
for
I
have
talk
as
much
,
and
sit
up
as
long
,
as
my
present
strength
would
permit
.
    
<EOS>
the
more
I
know
of
the
inmate
of
Moor
House
,
the
well
I
like
them
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
day
I
have
so
far
recover
my
health
that
I
could
sit
up
all
day
,
and
walk
out
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
could
join
with
Diana
and
Mary
in
all
their
occupation
;
converse
with
them
as
much
as
they
wish
,
and
aid
them
when
and
where
they
would
allow
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
reviving
pleasure
in
this
intercourse
,
of
a
kind
now
taste
by
me
for
the
first
time
 
the
pleasure
arise
from
perfect
congeniality
of
taste
,
sentiment
,
and
principle
.
  
<EOS>
I
like
to
read
what
they
like
to
read
:
what
they
enjoy
,
delight
me
;
what
they
approve
,
I
reverence
.
<EOS>
They
love
their
sequester
home
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
in
the
grey
,
small
,
antique
structure
,
with
its
low
roof
,
its
latticed
casement
,
its
mouldering
wall
,
its
avenue
of
aged
fir
 
<EOS>
all
grow
aslant
under
the
stress
of
mountain
wind
;
its
garden
,
dark
with
yew
and
holly
 
and
where
no
flower
but
of
the
hardy
specie
would
bloom
 
find
a
charm
both
potent
and
permanent
.
<EOS>
They
cling
to
the
purple
moor
behind
and
around
their
dwelling
 
to
the
hollow
vale
into
which
the
pebbly
bridle
-
path
lead
from
their
gate
descend
,
and
which
wound
between
fern
-
bank
first
,
and
then
amongst
a
few
of
the
wildest
little
pasture
-
field
that
ever
border
a
wilderness
of
heath
,
or
give
sustenance
to
a
flock
of
grey
moorland
sheep
,
with
their
little
mossy-
faced
lamb
:
 
<EOS>
they
cling
to
this
scene
,
I
say
,
with
a
perfect
enthusiasm
of
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
could
comprehend
the
feeling
,
and
share
both
its
strength
and
truth
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
fascination
of
the
locality
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
consecration
of
its
loneliness
:
my
eye
feast
on
the
outline
of
swell
and
sweep
 
on
the
wild
colouring
communicate
to
ridge
and
dell
by
moss
,
by
heath
-
bell
,
by
flower
-
sprinkle
turf
,
by
brilliant
bracken
,
and
mellow
granite
crag
.
<EOS>
these
detail
be
just
to
me
<EOS>
what
they
be
to
them
 
so
many
pure
and
sweet
source
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
the
strong
blast
and
the
soft
breeze
;
the
rough
and
the
halcyon
day
;
the
hour
of
sunrise
and
sunset
;
the
moonlight
and
the
clouded
night
,
develop
for
me
,
in
these
region
,
the
same
attraction
as
for
them
 
<EOS>
wound
round
my
faculty
the
same
spell
that
entrance
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
indoor
we
agree
equally
well
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
more
accomplished
and
better
read
than
I
be
;
but
with
eagerness
I
follow
in
the
path
of
knowledge
they
have
trodden
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
devour
the
book
they
lend
me
:
then
it
be
full
satisfaction
to
discuss
with
them
in
the
evening
what
I
have
peruse
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
think
fit
thought
;
opinion
meet
opinion
:
<EOS>
we
coincide
,
in
short
,
perfectly
.
  
<EOS>
if
in
our
trio
there
be
a
superior
and
a
leader
,
it
be
Diana
.
<EOS>
physically
,
she
far
excel
me
:
<EOS>
she
be
handsome
;
she
be
vigorous
.
<EOS>
in
her
animal
spirit
there
be
an
affluence
of
life
and
certainty
of
flow
,
such
as
excited
my
wonder
,
while
it
baffle
my
comprehension
.
<EOS>
I
could
talk
a
while
when
the
evening
commence
,
but
the
first
gush
of
vivacity
and
fluency
go
,
I
be
fain
to
sit
on
a
stool
at
Diana
's
foot
,
to
rest
my
head
on
her
knee
,
and
listen
alternately
to
her
and
Mary
,
while
they
sound
thoroughly
the
topic
on
which
I
have
but
touch
.
<EOS>
Diana
offer
to
teach
me
german
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
learn
of
her
:
I
see
the
part
of
instructress
pleased
and
suit
her
;
that
of
scholar
pleased
and
suit
me
no
less
.
<EOS>
Our
nature
dovetail
:
mutual
affection
 
of
the
strong
kind
 
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
They
discover
I
could
draw
:
their
pencil
and
colour
-
box
be
immediately
at
my
service
.
<EOS>
My
skill
,
great
in
this
one
point
than
theirs
,
surprise
and
charm
them
.
<EOS>
Mary
would
sit
and
watch
me
by
the
hour
together
:
then
she
would
take
lesson
;
and
a
docile
,
intelligent
,
assiduous
pupil
she
make
.
<EOS>
thus
occupy
,
and
mutually
entertain
,
day
pass
like
hour
,
and
week
like
day
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Mr.
St
John
,
the
intimacy
which
have
arise
so
naturally
and
rapidly
between
me
and
his
sister
do
not
extend
to
him
.
<EOS>
one
reason
of
the
distance
yet
observe
between
us
be
,
that
he
be
comparatively
seldom
at
home
:
a
large
proportion
of
his
time
appear
devoted
to
visit
the
sick
and
poor
among
the
scatter
population
of
his
parish
.
  
<EOS>
no
weather
seem
to
hinder
him
in
these
pastoral
excursion
:
rain
or
fair
,
he
would
,
when
his
hour
of
morning
study
be
over
,
take
his
hat
,
and
,
follow
by
his
father
's
old
pointer
,
Carlo
,
go
out
on
his
mission
of
love
or
duty
 
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
in
which
light
he
regard
it
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
the
day
be
very
unfavourable
,
his
sister
would
expostulate
.
<EOS>
He
would
then
say
,
with
a
peculiar
smile
,
more
solemn
than
cheerful
    
"
<EOS>
and
if
I
let
a
gust
of
wind
or
a
sprinkling
of
rain
turn
me
aside
from
these
easy
task
,
what
preparation
would
such
sloth
be
for
the
future
I
propose
to
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
's
general
answer
to
this
question
be
a
sigh
,
and
some
minute
of
apparently
mournful
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
but
besides
his
frequent
absence
,
there
be
another
barrier
to
friendship
with
him
:
he
seem
of
a
reserve
,
an
abstract
,
and
even
of
a
brood
nature
.
<EOS>
zealous
in
his
ministerial
labour
,
blameless
in
his
life
and
habit
,
he
yet
do
not
appear
to
enjoy
that
mental
serenity
,
that
inward
content
,
which
should
be
the
reward
of
every
sincere
christian
and
practical
philanthropist
.
<EOS>
often
,
of
an
evening
,
when
he
sit
at
the
window
,
his
desk
and
paper
before
him
,
he
would
cease
reading
or
writing
,
rest
his
chin
on
his
hand
,
and
deliver
himself
up
to
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
course
of
thought
;
but
that
it
be
perturb
and
exciting
may
be
see
in
the
frequent
flash
and
changeful
dilation
of
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
moreover
,
that
Nature
be
not
to
him
that
treasury
of
delight
it
be
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
express
once
,
and
but
once
in
my
hearing
,
a
strong
sense
of
the
rugged
charm
of
the
hill
,
and
an
inborn
affection
for
the
dark
roof
and
hoary
wall
he
call
his
home
;
but
there
be
more
of
gloom
than
pleasure
in
the
tone
and
word
in
which
the
sentiment
be
manifest
;
and
never
do
he
seem
to
roam
the
moor
for
the
sake
of
their
soothing
silence
 
never
seek
out
or
dwell
upon
the
thousand
peaceful
delight
they
could
yield
.
  
<EOS>
Incommunicative
<EOS>
as
he
be
,
some
time
elapse
before
I
have
an
opportunity
of
gauge
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
first
get
an
idea
of
its
calibre
when
I
hear
him
preach
in
his
own
church
at
Morton
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
describe
that
sermon
:
but
it
be
past
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
even
render
faithfully
the
effect
it
produce
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
begin
calm
 
and
indeed
,
as
far
as
delivery
and
pitch
of
voice
go
,
it
be
calm
to
the
end
:
an
earnestly
feel
,
yet
strictly
restrain
zeal
breathe
soon
in
the
distinct
accent
,
and
prompt
the
nervous
language
.
<EOS>
this
grow
to
force
 
compress
,
condense
,
control
.
<EOS>
the
heart
be
thrill
,
the
mind
astonish
,
by
the
power
of
the
preacher
:
neither
be
soften
.
<EOS>
throughout
there
be
a
strange
bitterness
;
an
absence
of
consolatory
gentleness
;
stern
allusion
to
calvinistic
doctrine
 
election
,
predestination
,
reprobation
 
be
frequent
;
and
each
reference
to
these
point
sound
like
a
sentence
pronounce
for
doom
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
,
instead
of
feel
well
,
calm
,
more
enlighten
by
his
discourse
,
I
experience
an
inexpressible
sadness
;
for
it
seem
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
equally
so
to
other
 
that
the
eloquence
to
which
I
have
be
listen
have
spring
from
a
depth
where
lie
turbid
dreg
of
disappointment
 
where
move
troubling
impulse
of
insatiate
yearning
and
disquiet
aspiration
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
<EOS>
St.
John
Rivers
 
<EOS>
pure
-
lived
,
conscientious
,
zealous
as
he
be
 
have
not
yet
find
that
peace
of
God
which
passeth
all
understanding
:
he
have
no
more
find
it
,
I
think
,
than
have
I
with
my
concealed
and
rack
regret
for
my
broken
idol
and
lose
elysium
 
regret
to
which
I
have
latterly
avoid
refer
,
but
which
possess
me
and
tyrannise
over
me
ruthlessly
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
a
month
be
go
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
be
soon
to
leave
Moor
House
,
and
return
to
the
far
different
life
and
scene
which
await
them
,
as
governess
in
a
large
,
fashionable
,
south
-
of

England
city
,
where
each
hold
a
situation
in
family
by
whose
wealthy
and
haughty
member
they
be
regard
only
as
humble
dependant
,
and
who
neither
know
nor
seek
out
their
innate
excellence
,
and
appreciate
only
their
acquire
accomplishment
as
they
appreciate
the
skill
of
their
cook
or
the
taste
of
their
waiting

woman

<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
have
say
nothing
to
me
yet
about
the
employment
he
have
promise
to
obtain
for
me
;
yet
it
become
urgent
that
I
should
have
a
vocation
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
one
morning
,
be
leave
alone
with
him
a
few
minute
in
the
parlour
,
I
venture
to
approach
the
window
-
recess
 
which
his
table
,
chair
,
and
desk
consecrate
as
a
kind
of
study
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
go
to
speak
,
though
<EOS>
not
very
well
know
in
what
word
to
frame
my
inquiry
 
for
it
be
at
all
time
difficult
to
break
the
ice
of
reserve
glassing
over
such
nature
as
his
 
when
he
save
me
the
trouble
by
be
the
first
to
commence
a
dialogue
.
  
<EOS>
look
up
as
I
draw
near
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
question
to
ask
of
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
wish
to
know

you
have
hear
of
any
service
I
can
offer
myself
to
undertake
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
or
devise
something
for
you
three
week
ago
;
but
as
you
seem
both
useful
and
happy
here
 
as
my
sister
have
evidently
become
attached
to
you
,
and
your
society
give
them
unusual
pleasure
 
<EOS>
I
deem
it
inexpedient
to
break
in
on
your
mutual
comfort
till
their
approach
departure
from
Marsh
End
should
render
yours
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
they
will
go
in
three
day
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
when
they
go
,
I
shall
return
to
the
parsonage
at
Morton
:
<EOS>
Hannah
will
accompany
me
;
and
this
old
house
will
be
shut
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wait
a
few
moment
,
expect
he
would
go
on
with
the
subject
first
broached
:
but
he
seem
to
have
enter
another
train
of
reflection
:
his
look
denote
abstraction
from
me
and
my
business
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
recall
him
to
a
theme
which
be
of
necessity
one
of
close
and
anxious
interest
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
employment
you
have
in
view
,
Mr.
Rivers
?
<EOS>
I
hope
this
delay
will
not
have
increase
the
difficulty
of
secure
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
since
it
be
an
employment
which
depend
only
on
me
to
give
,
and
you
to
accept
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
again
pause
:
there
seem
a
reluctance
to
continue
.
<EOS>
I
grow
impatient
:
<EOS>
a
restless
movement
or
two
,
and
an
eager
and
exact
glance
fasten
on
his
face
,
convey
the
feeling
to
him
as
effectually
as
word
could
have
do
,
and
with
less
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
be
in
no
hurry
to
hear
,
"
he
say
:
"
let
me
frankly
tell
you
,
I
have
nothing
eligible
or
profitable
to
suggest
.
<EOS>
before
I
explain
,
recall
,
if
you
please
,
my
notice
,
clearly
give
,
that
if
I
help
you
,
it
must
be
as
the
blind
man
would
help
the
lame
.
<EOS>
I
be
poor
;
for
I
find
that
,
when
I
have
pay
my
father
's
debt
,
all
the
patrimony
remain
to
me
will
be
this
crumble
grange
,
the
row
of
scathed
fir
behind
,
and
the
patch
of
moorish
soil
,
with
the
yew
-
tree
and
holly
-
bush
in
front
.
<EOS>
I
be
obscure
:
river
be
an
old
name
;
but
of
the
three
sole
descendant
of
the
race
,
two
earn
the
dependant
's
crust
among
stranger
,
and
the
third
consider
himself
an
alien
from
his
native
country
 
not
only
for
life
,
but
in
death
.
<EOS>
yes
,
and
deem
,
and
be
bind
to
deem
,
<EOS>
himself
honour
by
the
lot
,
and
aspire
but
after
the
day
when
the
cross
of
separation
from
fleshly
tie
shall
be
lay
on
his
shoulder
,
and
when
the
Head
of
that
church
-
militant
of
whose
humblest
member
he
be
one
,
<EOS>
shall
give
the
word
,
"
rise
,
follow
Me
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
St.
John
say
these
word
as
he
pronounce
his
sermon
,
with
a
quiet
,
deep
voice
;
with
an
unflushed
cheek
,
and
a
coruscating
radiance
of
glance
.
<EOS>
He
resume
    
"
<EOS>
and
since
I
be
myself
poor
and
obscure
,
I
can
offer
you
but
a
service
of
poverty
and
obscurity
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
may
even
think
it
degrade
 
for
I
see
now
<EOS>
your
habit
have
be
what
the
world
call
refine
:
your
taste
lean
to
the
ideal
,
and
your
society
have
at
least
be
amongst
the
educate
;
but
_
I
_
consider
that
no
service
degrade
which
can
better
our
race
.
<EOS>
I
hold
that
the
more
arid
and
unreclaime
the
soil
where
the
christian
labourer

task
of
tillage
be
appoint
him
 
the
scanty

the
high

honour

<EOS>
His
,
under
such
circumstance
,
be
the
destiny
of
the
pioneer

and
the
first
pioneer
of
the
Gospel
be
the
Apostles

their
captain

Jesus

Himself

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

<EOS>

I
say
,
as
he
again
pause
 
"
proceed

"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
before
he
proceed
:
indeed
,
he
seem
leisurely
to
read
my
face
,
as
if
its
feature
and
line
be
character
on
a
page

<EOS>
the
conclusion
draw
from
this
scrutiny
he
partially
express
in
his
succeed
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
will
accept
the
post
I
offer
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
hold
it
for
a
while
:
not
permanently

though
:
any
more
than
I
could
permanently
keep
the
narrow
and
narrow
 
the
tranquil

hide
office
of
English
country
incumbent

for
in
your
nature
be
an
alloy
as
detrimental
to
repose
as
that
in
mine

though
of
a
different
kind

<EOS>
"
  
"
do
explain
,
"
I
urge
,
when
he
halt
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
;
and
you
shall
hear
how
poor
the
proposal
be
,
 
how
trivial
 
<EOS>
how
cramp
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
stay
long
at
Morton
,
now
that
my
father
be
dead

and
that
I
be
my
own
master

<EOS>
I
shall
leave
the
place
probably
in
the
course
of
a
twelve
-
month
;
but
while
I
do
stay
,
I
will
exert
myself
to
the
utmost
for
its
improvement
.
<EOS>
Morton
,
when
I
come
to
it
two
year
ago
,
have
no
school
:
the
child
of
the
poor
be
exclude
from
every
hope
of
progress
.
<EOS>
I
establish
one
for
boy
:
I
mean
now
to
open
a
second
school
for
girl
.
<EOS>
I
have
hire
a
building
for
the
purpose
,
with
a
cottage
of
two
room
attach
to
it
for
the
mistress
's
house
.
<EOS>
Her
salary
will
be
thirty
pound
a
year
:
<EOS>
her
house
be
already
furnish
,
very
simply
,
but
<EOS>
sufficiently
,
by
the
kindness
of
a
lady
,
Miss
Oliver
;
the
only
daughter
of
the
sole
rich
man
in
my
parish
 
Mr.
Oliver
,
the
proprietor
of
a
needle-
factory
and
iron
-
foundry
in
the
valley
.
<EOS>
the
same
lady
pay
for
the
education
and
clothing
of
an
orphan
from
the
workhouse

on
condition
that
she
shall
aid
the
mistress
in
such
menial
office
connect
with
her
own
house
and
the
school
as
her
occupation
of
teaching
will
prevent
her
have
time
to
discharge
in
person
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
this
mistress
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
question
rather
hurriedly
;
he
seem
half
to
expect
an
indignant
,
or
at
least
a
disdainful
rejection
of
the
offer
:
not
know
all
my
thought
and
feeling
,
though
guess
some
,
he
could
not
tell
in
what
light
the
lot
would
appear
to
me
.
<EOS>
in
truth
it
be
humble
 
<EOS>
but
then
it
be
shelter
,
and
I
want
a
safe
asylum
<EOS>
:
it
be
plod
 
but
then
,
compare
with
that
of
a
governess
in
a
rich
house
,
it
be
independent
;
and
the
fear
of
servitude
with
stranger
enter
my
soul
like
iron
:
it
be
not
ignoble
 
not
unworthy
 
not
mentally
degrading
,
I
make
my
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
the
proposal

Mr.

I
accept
it
with
all

he
say

one
well

deeply

I
be
go
to

impassione

perhaps
you
would
have
misunderstood

be

one

Diana
intimate

My
father
and
he
quarrel
long
ago

<EOS>
It
be
by
his
advice
that
my
father
risk
most
of
his
property
in
the
speculation
that
ruin
him
.
<EOS>
mutual
recrimination
pass
between
them
:
they
part
in
anger
,
and
be
never
reconcile
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
engage
afterwards
in
more
prosperous
undertaking
:
it
appear
he
realise
a
fortune
of
twenty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
He
be
never
marry
,
and
have
no
near
kindred
but
ourselves
and
one
other
person
,
not
more
closely
related
than
we
.
<EOS>
My
father
always
cherish
the
idea
that
he
would
atone
for
his
error
by
leave
his
possession
to
us
;
that
letter
inform
us
that
he
have
bequeath
every
penny
to
the
other
relation

with
the
exception
of
thirty
guinea
,
to
be
divide
between
St.
John
,
Diana
,
and
Mary
Rivers
,
for
the
purchase
of
three
mourning
ring
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
right
,
of
course
,
to
do
as
he
please
:
and
yet
a
momentary
damp
be
cast
on
the
spirit
by
the
receipt
of
such
news
.
<EOS>
Mary
and
I
would
have
esteem
ourselves
rich
with
a
thousand
pound
each
;
and
to
St.
John
such
a
sum
would
have
be
valuable

for
the
good
it
would
have
enable
him
to
do

<EOS>
My
home
,
then
,
when
I
at
last
find
a
home
,
 
be
a
cottage
;
a
little
room
with
whitewashed
wall
and
a
sanded
floor
,
contain
four
paint
chair
and
a
table
,
a
clock
,
a
cupboard
,
with
two
or
three
plate
and
dish
,
and
a
set
of
tea
-
thing
in
delf
.
<EOS>
above
,
a
chamber
of
the
same
dimension
as
the
kitchen
,
with
a
deal
bedstead
and
chest
of
drawer
;
small
,
yet
too
large
to
be
fill
with
my
scanty
wardrobe
:
though
the
kindness
of
my
gentle
and
generous
friend
have
increase
that
,
by
a
modest
stock
of
such
thing
as
be
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
evening
.
<EOS>
I
have
dismiss
,
with
the
fee
of
an
orange
,
the
little
orphan
who
serve
me
as
a
handmaid
.
<EOS>
I
be
sit
alone
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
this
morning
,
the
village
school
open
.
<EOS>
I
have
twenty
scholar
.
<EOS>
but
three
of
the
number
can
read
:
none
write
or
cipher
.
<EOS>
several
knit
,
and
a
few
sew
a
little
.
<EOS>
They
speak
with
the
broad
accent
of
the
district
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
they
and
I
have
a
difficulty
in
understand
each
other
's
language
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
be
unmannered
,
rough
,
intractable
,
as
well
as
ignorant
;
but
other
be
docile
,
have
a
wish
to
learn
,
and
evince
a
disposition
that
please
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
forget
that
these
coarsely
-
clothe
little
peasant
be
of
flesh
and
blood
as
good
as
the
scion
of
gentle
genealogy
;
and
that
the
germ
of
native
excellence
,
refinement
,
intelligence
,
kind
feeling
,
be
as
likely
to
exist
in
their
heart
as
in
those
of
the
best

bear
.
<EOS>
My
duty
will
be
to
develop
these
germ
:
surely
I
shall
find
some
happiness
in
discharge
that
office
.
<EOS>
much
enjoyment
I
do
not
expect
in
the
life
open
before
me
:
yet
it
will
,
doubtless
,
<EOS>
if
I
regulate
my
mind
,
and
exert
my
power
as
I
ought
,
yield
me
enough
to
live
on
from
day
to
day
.
  
<EOS>
be
I
very
gleeful
,
settle
,
content
,
during
the
hour
I
pass
in
yonder
bare
,
humble
schoolroom
this
morning
and
afternoon
?
<EOS>
not
to
deceive
myself
,
I
must
reply
 
<EOS>
no
:
<EOS>
I
feel
desolate
to
a
degree
.
<EOS>
I
feel
 
<EOS>
yes
,
idiot
that
I
be
 
<EOS>
I
feel
degraded
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
I
have
take
a
step
which
sink
instead
of
raise
me
in
the
scale
of
social
existence
.
<EOS>
I
be
weakly
dismay
at
the
ignorance
,
the
poverty
,
the
coarseness
of
all
I
hear
and
see
round
me
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
not
hate
and
despise
myself
too
much
for
these
feeling
;
I
know
them
to
be
wrong
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
great
step
gain
;
I
shall
strive
to
overcome
them
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
,
I
trust
,
I
shall
get
the
well
of
them
partially
;
and
in
a
few
week
,
perhaps
,
they
will
be
quite
subdue
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
month
,
it
be
possible
,
the
happiness
of
see
progress
,
and
a
change
for
the
well
in
my
scholar
may
substitute
gratification
for
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
,
let
me
ask
myself
one
question
 
<EOS>
which
be
well
?
 
<EOS>
to
have
surrender
to
temptation
;
listen
to
passion
;
make
no
painful
effort
 
<EOS>
no
struggle
;
 
but
to
have
sink
down
in
the
silken
snare
;
fallen
asleep
on
the
flower
cover
it
;
waken
in
a
southern
clime
,
amongst
the
luxury
of
a
pleasure
villa
:
to
have
be
now
live
in
France
,
Mr.
Rochester
's
mistress
;
delirious
with
his
love
half
my
time
 
for
he
would
 
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
he
would
have
love
me
well
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
He
_
<EOS>
do
_
love
me
 
<EOS>
no
one
will
ever
love
me
so
again
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
more
know
the
sweet
homage
give
to
beauty
,
youth
,
and
grace
 
for
never
to
any
one
else
<EOS>
shall
I
seem
to
possess
these
charm
.
<EOS>
He
be
fond
and
proud
of
me
 
<EOS>
it
be
what
no
man
besides
will
ever
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
where
be
I
wander
,
and
what
be
I
say
,
and
above
all
,
feel
?
<EOS>
whether
be
it
well
,
I
ask
,
to
be
a
slave
in
a
fool
's
paradise
at
Marseilles
 
fevere
with
delusive
bliss
one
hour
 
suffocate
with
the
bitter
tear
of
remorse
and
shame
the
next
 
or
to
be
a
village
-
schoolmistress
,
free
and
honest
,
in
a
breezy
mountain
nook
in
the
healthy
heart
of
England
?
  
<EOS>
yes
;
I
feel
now
that
I
be
right
when
I
adhere
to
principle
and
law
,
and
scorn
and
crush
the
insane
prompting
of
a
frenzied
moment
.
<EOS>
God
direct
me
to
a
correct
choice
:
I
thank
His
providence
for
the
guidance
!
  
<EOS>
have
bring
my
eventide
musing
to
this
point
,
I
rise
,
go
to
my
door
,
and
look
at
the
sunset
of
the
harvest
-
day
,
and
at
the
quiet
field
before
my
cottage
,
which
,
with
the
school
,
be
distant
half
a
mile
from
the
village
.
<EOS>
the
bird
be
singe
their
last
strain
    
<EOS>
"
the
air
be
mild
,
the
dew
be
balm
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
I
look
,
I
think
myself
happy
,
and
be
surprised
to
find
myself
ere
long
weeping
 
and
why
?
<EOS>
for
the
doom
which
have
reave
me
from
adhesion
to
my
master
:
for
him
I
be
no
more
to
see
;
for
the
desperate
grief
and
fatal
fury
 
consequence
of
my
departure
 
which
may
now
,
perhaps
,
be
drag
him
from
the
path
of
right
,
too
far
to
leave
hope
of
ultimate
restoration
thither
.
<EOS>
at
this
thought
,
I
turn
my
face
aside
from
the
lovely
sky
of
eve
and
lonely
vale
of
Morton
 
<EOS>
I
say
_
lonely
_
,
for
in
that
bend
of
it
visible
to
me
<EOS>
there
be
no
building
apparent
save
the
church
and
the
parsonage
,
half
-
hide
in
tree
,
and
,
quite
at
the
extremity
,
the
roof
of
Vale
Hall
,
where
the
rich
Mr.
Oliver
and
his
daughter
live
.
<EOS>
I
hide
my
eye
,
and
leant
my
head
against
the
stone
frame
of
my
door
;
but
soon
a
slight
noise
near
the
wicket
which
shut
in
my
tiny
garden
from
the
meadow
beyond
it
make
me
look
up
.
<EOS>
a

I

the
gate
with
his
nose

and
St.

himself
lean
upon
it
with
fold
arm
;
his
brow
knit
,
his
gaze
,
grave
almost
to
displeasure
,
fix
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
can
not
stay
;
I
have
only
bring
you
a
little
parcel

I
think
it
contain
a
colour
-
box
,
pencil
,
and
paper

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
approach
to
take
it
:
a
welcome
gift
it
be
.
<EOS>
He
examine
my
face
,
I
think
,
with
austerity
,
as
I
come
near
:
the
trace
of
tear
be
doubtless
very
visible
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
find
your
first
day
's
work
harder
than
you
expect
?
"
he
ask

<EOS>
"
oh

no

on
the
contrary

I
think
in
time
I
shall
get
on
with
my

very
well

perhaps
your
accommodation
 
your
cottage
 
your
furniture
 
have
disappoint
your
expectation

I

proof

my

commodious

I
see
have
make
me
thankful

not

I
be
not
absolutely
such
a
fool

sensualist
as
to
regret
the
absence
of
a
carpet

a
sofa

besides

five
week
ago
I
have
nothing

outcast

a
beggar

a
vagrant

now
I
have
acquaintance
,
a
home

a
business

<EOS>
I
wonder
at
the
goodness
of
God
;
the
generosity
of
my
friend
;
the
bounty
of
my
lot

tranquillity

impatient

of
loneliness

what
you
have
leave
before
I
see
you
,
of
course
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
counsel
you
to
resist
firmly
every
temptation
which
would
incline
you
to
look
back

pursue
your

steadily

for
some

make

its
uniform
duty

me
to
death

I
burn
for

for
the
more
exciting
toil

destiny

anything

recognise
his
friend

you

sir

he

his
ear

wag
his
tail
when
I
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
field

and
you
have
your

towards
me
now

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
.
<EOS>
though
Mr.
Rivers
have
start
at
the
first
of
those
musical
accent
,
as
if
a
thunderbolt
have
split
a
cloud
over
his
head
,
he
stand
yet
,
at
the
close
of
the
sentence
,
in
the
same
attitude
in
which
the
speaker
have
surprise
him
 
his
arm
rest
on
the
gate
,
his
face
direct
towards
the
west
.
<EOS>
He
turn
at
last
,
with
measure
deliberation
.
<EOS>
a
vision
,
as
it
seem
to
me
,
have
rise
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
there
appear
,
within
three
foot
of
him
,
a
form
clothe
in
pure
white
 
<EOS>
a
youthful
,
graceful
form
:
full
,
yet
fine
in
contour
;
and
when
,
after
bend
to
caress
Carlo
,
it
lift
up
its
head
,
and
throw
back
a
long
veil
,
there
bloom
under
his
glance
a
face
of
perfect
beauty
.
<EOS>
perfect
beauty
be
a
strong
expression
;
but
I
do
not
retrace
or
qualify
it
:
as
sweet
feature
as
ever
the
temperate
clime
of
Albion
mould
;
as
pure
hue
of
rose
and
lily
as
ever
her
humid
gale
and
vapoury
sky
generate
and
screened
,
justify
,
in
this
instance
,
the
term
.
<EOS>
no
charm
be
want
,
no
defect
be
perceptible
;
the
young
girl
have
regular
and
delicate
lineament
;
eye
shape
and
colour
as
we
see
them
in
lovely
picture
,
large
,
and
dark
,
and
full
;
the
long
and
shadowy
eyelash
which
encircle
a
fine
eye
with
so
soft
a
fascination
;
the
pencil
brow
which
give
such
clearness
;
the
white
smooth
forehead
,
which
add
such
repose
to
the
lively
beauty
of
tint
and
ray
;
the
cheek
oval
,
fresh
,
and
smooth
;
the
lip
,
fresh
too
,
ruddy
,
healthy
,
sweetly

;
the

without

<EOS>
all

which

<EOS>
I
wonder
,
as
I
look
at
this
fair
creature
:
<EOS>
I
admire
her
with
my
whole
heart

<EOS>
nature
have
surely
form
her
in

partial
mood

,
forget
her

mother
dole

this

<EOS>
what
do
St.
John
Rivers
think
of
this
earthly
angel
?
<EOS>
I
naturally
ask
myself
that
question
as
I
see
him
turn
to
her
and
look
at
her
;
and
,
as
naturally
,
I
seek
the
answer
to
the
inquiry
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
withdraw
his
eye
from
the
Peri
,
and
be
look
at
a
humble
tuft
of
daisy
which
grow
by
the
wicket
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
lovely
evening
,
but
<EOS>
late
for
you

be
out
alone

he
say
,
as
he
crush
the
snowy

the
close
flower
with
his
foot

<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
Papa

so
I

ask

You

<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
Mr.

I

gay

stay
at
S-

<EOS>
last

rather
this

I
be

two
o'clock

<EOS>
the
th
regiment
be
station
there
since
the
riot

and
the
officer
be
the
most
agreeable
man
in
the
world

they
put
all
our
young
knife

grinder
and
scissor
merchant
to
shame

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
Mr.
St.
John
's
under
lip
protrude
,
and
his
upper
lip
curl
a
moment
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
certainly
look
a
good
deal
compress
,
and
the
low
part
of
his
face
unusually
stern
and
square
,
as
the
laugh
girl
give
him
this
information
.
<EOS>
He
lift
his
gaze
,
too
,
from
the
daisy
,
and
turn
it
on
her
.
<EOS>
an
unsmiling
,
a
searching
,
a
meaning
gaze
<EOS>
it
be
.
<EOS>
She
answer
it
with
a
second
laugh

and
laughter
well
become
her
youth
,
her
rose
,
her
dimple

her
bright
eye

<EOS>
as
he
stand

mute

she
again
fall
to
caress
Carlo

"

poor

"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
be
not
stern

distant

his

and
if
he
could
speak
,
he
would
not
be
silent

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
pat
the
dog
's
head
,
bend
with
native
grace
before
his
young
and
austere
master
,
I
see
a
glow
rise
to
that
master
's
face
.
<EOS>
I
see
his
solemn
eye
melt
with
sudden
fire
,
and
flicker
with
resistless
emotion
.
<EOS>
Flushed
and
kindle
thus
,
he
look
nearly
as
beautiful
for
a
man
as
she
for
a
woman
.
<EOS>
His
chest
heave
once
,
as
if
his
large
heart
,
weary
of
despotic
constriction
,
have
expand
,
despite
the
will
,
and
make
a
vigorous
bind
for
the
attainment
of
liberty

<EOS>
but
he
curb
it
,
I
think
,
as
a
resolute
rider
would
curb
a
rearing
steed
.
<EOS>
He
respond
neither
by
word
nor
movement
to
the
gentle
advance
make
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa

continue
Miss

look
up

She
fill
up
the
hiatus

leave
by
a
reply
of
her
own

<EOS>
"
I

she
exclaim

shake
her
beautiful

<EOS>
Mr.

it
cost
him
thus

refuse

<EOS>
"
well

<EOS>
She
hold
out
her
hand

<EOS>
He
just
touch
it
.
"
<EOS>
good
evening

<EOS>
he
repeat
,
in
a
voice
low
and
hollow
as
an
echo

<EOS>
She
turn
,
but
in
a
moment
return

<EOS>
"
be
you
well

"
<EOS>
she
ask

<EOS>
well
may
she
put
the
question
:
his

blanch
as

<EOS>
"

enunciate
;
and
,
with
a
bow
,
he
leave
the
gate

<EOS>
She
go
one
way
;
he
another

<EOS>
She
turn
twice
to
gaze
after
him
as
she
trip
fairy

like
down
the
field

he
,
as
he
stride
firmly
across
,
never
turn
at
all

<EOS>
this
spectacle
of
another
be
suffering

sacrifice
rapt
my

<EOS>
Diana
Rivers
have
designate
her
brother
"
inexorable
as
death

<EOS>
"
She
have
not
exaggerate
.
    
<EOS>
I
continue
the
labour
of
the
village
-
school
as
actively
and
faithfully
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
It
be
truly
hard
work
at
first
.
<EOS>
some
time
elapse
before
,
with
all
my
effort
,
I
could
comprehend
my
scholar
and
their
nature
.
<EOS>
wholly
untaught
,
with
faculty
quite
torpid
,
they
seem
to
me
hopelessly
dull
;
and
,
at
first
sight
,
all
dull
alike
:
<EOS>
but
I
soon
find
I
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
difference
amongst
them
as
amongst
the
educate
;
and
when
I
get
to
know
them
,
and
they
me
,
this
difference
rapidly
develop
itself
.
<EOS>
Their
amazement
at
me
,
my
language
,
my
rule
,
and
way
,
once
subside
,
I
find
some
of
these
heavy
-
look
,
gape
rustic
wake
up
into
sharp
-
witted
girl
enough
.
<EOS>
many
show
themselves
oblige
,
and
amiable
too
;
and
I
discover
amongst
them
not
a
few
example
of
natural
politeness
,
and
innate
self
-
respect
,
as
well
as
of
excellent
capacity
,
that
win
both
my
goodwill
and
my
admiration
.
<EOS>
these
soon
take
a
pleasure
in
do
their
work
well
,
in
keep
their
person
neat
,
in
learn
their
task
regularly
,
in
acquire
quiet
and
orderly
manner
.
<EOS>
the
rapidity
of
their
progress
,
in
some
instance
,
be
even
surprising
;
and
an
honest
and
happy
pride
I
take
in
it
:
besides
,
I
begin
personally
to
like
some
of
the
good
girl
;
and
they
like
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
amongst
my
scholar
several
farmer
'
daughter
:
young
woman
grow
,
almost
.
<EOS>
these
could
already
read
,
write
,
and
sew
;
and
to
them
I
teach
the
element
of
grammar
,
geography
,
history
,
and
the
fine
kind
of
needlework
.
<EOS>
I
find
estimable
character
amongst
them
 
character
desirous
of
information
and
dispose
for
improvement
 
with
whom
I
pass
many
a
pleasant
evening
hour
in
their
own
home
.
<EOS>
Their
parent
then
(
the
farmer
and
his
wife
)
load
me
with
attention
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
enjoyment
in
accept
their
simple
kindness
,
and
in
repay
it
by
a
consideration
 
a
scrupulous
regard
to
their
feeling
 
to
which
they
be
not
,
perhaps
,
at
all
time
accustomed
,
and
which
both
charm
and
benefit
them
;
because
,
while
it
elevate
them
in
their
own
eye
,
it
make
them
emulous
to
merit
the
deferential
treatment
they
receive
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
I
become
a
favourite
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
go
out
,
I
hear
on
all
side
cordial
salutation
,
and
be
welcome
with
friendly
smile
.
<EOS>
to
live
amidst
general
regard
,
though
it
be
<EOS>
but
the
regard
of
work
people
,
be
like
"
sit
in
sunshine
,
calm
and
sweet
;
"
serene
inward
feeling
bud
and
bloom
under
the
ray
.
<EOS>
at
this
period
of
my
life
,
my
heart
far
oftener
swell
with
thankfulness
than
sink
with
dejection
:
and
yet
,
reader
,
to
tell
you
all
,
in
the
midst
of
this
calm
,
this
useful
existence
 
after
a
day
pass
in
honourable
exertion
amongst
my
scholar
,
an
evening
spend
in
draw
or
read
contentedly
alone
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
rush
into
strange
dream
at
night
:
dream
many
-
coloured
,
agitate
,
full
of
the
ideal
,
the
stirring
,
the
stormy
 
dream
where
,
amidst
unusual
scene
,
charge
with
adventure
,
with
agitate
risk
and
romantic
chance
,
I
still
again
and
again
meet
Mr.
Rochester
,
always
at
some
exciting
crisis
;
and
then
the
sense
of
be
in
his
arm
,
hear
his
voice
,
meet
his
eye
,
touch
his
hand
and
cheek
,
love
him
,
be
love
by
him
 
the
hope
of
pass
a
lifetime
at
his
side
,
would
be
renew
,
with
all
its
first
force
and
fire
.
<EOS>
then
I
awake
.
<EOS>
then
I
recall
where
I
be
,
and
how
situated
.
<EOS>
then
I
rise
up
on
my
curtainless
bed
,
tremble
and
quiver
;
and
then
the
still
,
dark
night
witness
the
convulsion
of
despair
,
and
hear
the
burst
of
passion
.
<EOS>
by
nine
o'clock
the
next
morning
I
be
punctually
open
the
school
;
tranquil
,
settle
,
prepare
for
the
steady
duty
of
the
day
.

She

long
curl
that
kiss
her
cheek
and
float
to
her
shoulder
,
can
scarcely
be
imagine
:
and
it
be
thus
she
would
enter
the
rustic
building
,
and
glide
through
the
dazzle
rank
of
the
village
child
.
<EOS>
She
generally
come
at
the
hour
when
Mr.
Rivers
be
engage
in
give
his
daily
catechising
lesson
.
<EOS>
keenly
,
I
fear
,
do
the
eye
of
the
visitress
pierce
the
young
pastor
's
heart
.
<EOS>
a
sort
of
instinct
seem
to
warn
him
of
her
entrance
,
even
when
he
do
not
see
it
;
and
when
he
be
look
quite
away
from
the
door
,
if
she
appear
at
it
,
his
cheek
would
glow
,
and
his
marble
-
seem
feature
,
though
they
refuse
to
relax
,
change
indescribably
,
and
in
their
very
quiescence
become
expressive
of
a
repressed
fervour
,
strong
than
work
muscle
or
dart
glance
could
indicate
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
she
know
her
power
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
do
not
,
because
he
could
not
,
conceal
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
christian
stoicism
,
when
she
go
up
and
address
him
,
and
smile
gaily
,
encouragingly
,
even
fondly
in
his
face
,
his
hand
would
tremble
and
his
eye
burn
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
say
,
with
his
sad
and
resolute
look
,
if
he
do
not
say
it
with
his
lip
,
"
I
love
you
,
and
I
know
you
prefer
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
despair
of
success
that
keep
me
dumb
.
<EOS>
if
I
offer
my
heart
,
I
believe
you
would
accept
it
.
<EOS>
but
that
heart
be
already
lay
on
a
sacred
altar
:
the
fire
be
arrange
round
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
be
no
more
than
a
sacrifice
consume
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
she
would
pout
like
a
disappointed
child
;
a
pensive
cloud
would
soften
her
radiant
vivacity
;
she
would
withdraw
her
hand
hastily
from
his
,
and
turn
in
transient
petulance
from
his
aspect
,
at
once
so
heroic
and
so
martyr
-
like
.
<EOS>
St.
John
,
no
doubt
,
would
have
give
the
world
to
follow
,
recall
,
retain
her
,
when
she
thus
leave
him
;
but
he
would
not
give
one
chance
of
heaven
,
nor
relinquish
,
for
the
elysium
of
her
love
,
one
hope
of
the
true
,
eternal
Paradise
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
could
not
bind
all
that
he
have
in
his
nature
 
<EOS>
the
rover
,
the
aspirant
,
the
poet
,
the
priest
 
in
the
limit
of
a
single
passion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
 
he
would
not
 
renounce
his
wild
field
of
mission
warfare
for
the
parlour
and
the
peace
of
Vale
Hall
.
<EOS>
I
learn
so
much
from
himself
in
an
inroad
I
once
,
despite
his
reserve
,
have
the
daring
to
make
on
his
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Oliver
already
honour
me
with
frequent
visit
to
my
cottage
.
<EOS>
I
have
learn
her
whole
character
,
which
be
without
mystery
or
disguise
<EOS>
:
she
be
coquettish
but
not
heartless
;
exact
,
but
not
worthlessly
selfish
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
indulge
from
her
birth
,
but
be
not
absolutely
spoilt
.
<EOS>
She
be
hasty
,
but
good
-
humoured
;
vain
<EOS>
(
she
could
not
help
it
,
when
every
glance
in
the
glass
show
her
such
a
flush
of
loveliness
)
,
but
not
affect
;
liberal
-
handed
;
innocent
of
the
pride
of
wealth
;
ingenuous
;
sufficiently
intelligent
;
gay
,
lively
,
and
unthinking
:
she
be
very
charming
,
in
short
,
even
to
a
cool
observer
of
her
own
sex
like
me
;
but
she
be
not
profoundly
interesting
or
thoroughly
impressive
.
<EOS>
a
very
different
sort
of
mind
be
her
from
that
,
for
instance
,
of
the
sister
of
St.
John
.
<EOS>
still
,
I
like
her
almost
as
I
like
my
pupil
Adele
;
except
that
,
for
a
child
whom
we
have
watch
over
and
teach
,
a
close
affection
be
engender
than
we
can
give
an
equally
attractive
adult
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
take
an
amiable
caprice
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
say
I
be
like
Mr.
Rivers
,
only
,
certainly
,
she
allow
,
"
not
one
-
tenth
<EOS>
so
handsome
,
though
I
be
a
nice
neat
little
soul
enough
,
but
he
be
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
however
,
good
,
clever
,
compose
,
and
firm
,
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
_
lusus
naturae
_
<EOS>
,
she
affirm
,
as
a
village
schoolmistress
:
she
be
sure
my
previous
history
,
if
know
,
would
make
a
delightful
romance
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
,
while
,
with
her
usual
child
-
like
activity
,
and
thoughtless
yet
not
offensive
inquisitiveness
,
she
be
rummage
the
cupboard
and
the
table
-
drawer
of
my
little
kitchen
,
she
discover
first
two
french
book
,
a
volume
of
Schiller
,
a
german
grammar
and
dictionary
,
and
then
my
drawing

material
and
some
sketch
,
include
a
pencil
-
head
of
a
pretty
little
cherub
-
like
girl
,
one
of
my
scholar
,
and
sundry
view
from
nature
,
take
in
the
Vale
of
Morton
and
on
the
surround
moor
.
<EOS>
She
be
first
transfix
with
surprise
,
and
then
electrify
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
I
do
these
picture
?
<EOS>
do
I
know
french
and
german
?
<EOS>
what
a
love
 
<EOS>
what
a
miracle
<EOS>
I
be
!
<EOS>
I
draw
better
than
her
master
in
the
first
school
in
S-
.
<EOS>
Would
I
sketch
a
portrait
of
her
,
to
show
to
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
pleasure
,
"
I
reply
;
and
I
feel
a
thrill
of
artist
-
delight
at
the
idea
of
copy
from
so
perfect
and
radiant
a
model
.
<EOS>
She
have
then
on
a
dark
-
blue
silk
dress
;
her
arm
and
her
neck
be
bare
;
her
only
ornament
be
her
chestnut
tress
,
which
wave
over
her
shoulder
with
all
the
wild
grace
of
natural
curl
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
sheet
of
fine
card
-
board
,
and
draw
a
careful
outline
.
<EOS>
I
promise
myself
the
pleasure
of
colour
it
;
and
,
as
it
be
get
late
then
,
I
tell
her
she
must
come
and
sit
another
day
.
  
<EOS>
She
make
such
a
report
of
me
to
her
father
,
that
Mr.
Oliver
himself
accompany
her
next
evening
 
<EOS>
a
tall
,
massive
-
featured
,
middle
-
aged
,
and
grey
-
head
man
,
at
whose
side
his
lovely
daughter
look
like
a
bright
flower
near
a
hoary
turret
.
<EOS>
He
appear
a
taciturn
,
and
perhaps
a
proud
personage
;
but
he
be
very
kind
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
sketch
of
Rosamond
's
portrait
please
him
highly
:
he
say
I
must
make
a
finished
picture
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
insist
,
too
,
on
my
come
the
next
day
to
spend
the
evening
at
Vale
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
.
<EOS>
I
find
it
a
large
,
handsome
residence
,
show
abundant
evidence
of
wealth
in
the
proprietor
.
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
full
of
glee
and
pleasure
all
the
time
I
stay
.
<EOS>
Her
father
be
affable
;
and
when
he
enter
into
conversation
with
me
after
tea
,
he
express
in
strong
term
his
approbation
of
what
I
have
do
in
Morton
school
,
and
say
he
only
fear
,
from
what
he
see
and
hear
,
I
be
too
good
for
the
place
,
and
would
soon
quit
it
for
one
more
suitable
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
cry
Rosamond
,
"
she
be
clever
enough
to
be
a
governess
in
a
high
family
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
would
far
rather
be
where
I
be
than
in
any
high
family
in
the
land
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Oliver
speak
of
Mr.
Rivers
 
of
the
Rivers
family
 
with
great
respect
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
a
very
old
name
in
that
neighbourhood
;
that
the
ancestor
of
the
house
be
wealthy
;
that
all
Morton
have
once
belong
to
them
;
that
even
now
he
consider
the
representative
of
that
house
may
,
if
he
like
,
make
an
alliance
with
the
good
.
<EOS>
He
account
it
a
pity
that
so
fine
and
talente
a
young
man
should
have
form
the
design
of
go
out
as
a
missionary
;
it
be
quite
throw
a
valuable
life
away
.
<EOS>
It
appear
,
then
,
that
her
father
would
throw
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
Rosamond
's
union
with
St.
John
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Oliver
evidently
regard
the
young
clergyman
's
good
birth
,
old
name
,
and
sacred
profession
as
sufficient
compensation
for
the
want
of
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
5th
of
November
,
and
a
holiday
.
<EOS>
My
little
servant
,
after
help
me
to
clean
my
house
,
be
go
,
well
satisfied
with
the
fee
of
a
penny
for
her
aid
.
<EOS>
all
about
me
be
spotless
and
bright
 
scoured
floor
,
polished
grate
,
and
well
-
rub
chair
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
make
myself
neat
,
and
have
now
the
afternoon
before
me
to
spend
as
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
the
translation
of
a
few
page
of
German
occupy
an
hour
;
then
I
get
my
palette
and
pencil
,
and
fall
to
the
more
soothing
,
because
easy
occupation
,
of
complete
Rosamond
Oliver
's
miniature
.
<EOS>
the
head
be
finish
already
:
there
be
but
the
background
to
tint
and
the
drapery
to
shade
off
;
a
touch
of
carmine
,
too
,
to
add
to
the
ripe
lip
 
a
soft
curl
here
and
there
to
the
tress
 
a
deep
tinge
to
the
shadow
of
the
lash
under
the
azure
eyelid
.
<EOS>
I
be
absorb
in
the
execution
of
these
nice
detail
,
when
,
after
one
rapid
tap
,
my
door
unclosed
,
admit
St.
John
Rivers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
see
how
you
be
spend
your
holiday

he
say
.
<EOS>
"
not
,
I
hope
,
in
thought

<EOS>
no

that
be
well
:
while
you
draw
you
will
not
feel
lonely
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
mistrust
you
still
,
though
you
have
bear
up
wonderfully
so
far
.
<EOS>
I
have
bring
you
a
book
for
evening
solace
,
"
and
he
lay
on
the
table
a
new
publication
 
<EOS>
a
poem
:
<EOS>
one
of
those
genuine
production
so
often
vouchsafe
to
the
fortunate
public
of
those
day
 
the
golden
age
of
modern
literature
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
the
reader
of
our
era
be
less
favoured
.
<EOS>
but
courage
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
pause
either
to
accuse
or
repine
.
<EOS>
I
know
poetry
be
not
dead
,
nor
genius
lose
;
nor
have
Mammon
gain
power
over
either
,
to
bind
or
slay
:
they
will
both
assert
their
existence
,
their
presence
,
their
liberty
and
strength
again
one
day
.
<EOS>
powerful
angel
,
safe
in
heaven
!
<EOS>
they
smile
when
sordid
soul
triumph
,
and
feeble
one
weep
over
their
destruction
.
<EOS>
poetry
destroy
?
<EOS>
genius
banish
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
Mediocrity
,
no
<EOS>
:
do
not
let
envy
prompt
you
to
the
thought
.
<EOS>
no
;
they
not
only
live
,
but
reign
and
redeem
:
<EOS>
and
without
their
divine
influence
spread
everywhere
,
you
would
be
in
hell
 
the
hell
of
your
own
meanness
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
eagerly
glance
at
the
bright
page
of
"
Marmion
"
(
for
"
Marmion
"
it
be
)
,
St.
John
stoop
to
examine
my
drawing
.
<EOS>
His
tall
figure
spring
erect
again
with
a
start
<EOS>
:
he
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
at
him
:
he
shun
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
thought
well
,
and
could
read
his
heart
plainly
;
at
the
moment
I
feel
calm
and
cool
than
he
:
I
have
then
temporarily
the
advantage
of
him
,
and
I
conceive
an
inclination
to
do
him
some
good
,
if
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
all
his
firmness
and
self
-
control
,
"
think
I
,
"
he
task
himself
too
far
:
lock
every
feeling
and
pang
within
 
express
,
confesse
,
impart
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
would
benefit
him
to
talk
a
little
about
this
sweet
Rosamond
,
whom
he
think
he
ought
not
to
marry
:
I
will
make
him
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
first
,
"
take
a
chair
,
Mr.
Rivers
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
answer
,
as
he
always
do
,
that
he
could
not
stay

"
<EOS>
very
well
,
"
I
respond
,
mentally
,
"
stand
if
you
like
;
but
you
shall
not
go
just
yet
<EOS>
,
I
be
determined
:
solitude
be
at
least
as
bad
for
you
as
it
be
for
me

<EOS>
I
will
try
if
I
can
not
discover
the
secret
spring
of
your
confidence
,
and
find
an
aperture
in
that
marble
breast
through
which
I
can
shed
one
drop
of
the
balm
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
portrait
like
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
bluntly
.
  
<EOS>
"
like
!
<EOS>
like
whom
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
observe
it
closely

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
Mr.
Rivers
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
almost
start
at
my
sudden
and
strange
abruptness
:
he
look
at
me
astonish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
that
be
nothing

"
I
mutter
within
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
be
baffle
by
a
little
stiffness
on
your
part

I
be
prepared
to
go
to
considerable
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
continue
,
"
You
observe
it
closely
and
distinctly
;
but
I
have
no
objection
to
your
looking
at
it
again
,

and
I
rise
and
place
it
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
well
-
execute
picture
,
"
he
say
;
"
very
soft
,
clear
colouring
;
very
graceful
and
correct
drawing

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes

I
know
all
that

<EOS>
but
what
of
the
resemblance
?
<EOS>
who
be
it
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
master
some
hesitation
,
he
answer
,
"
Miss
Oliver

I
presume

"
  
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
sir
,
to
reward
you
for
the
accurate
guess
,
I
will
promise
to
paint
you
a
careful
and
faithful
duplicate
of
this
very
picture
,
provide
you
admit
that
the
gift
would
be
acceptable
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
throw
away
my
time
and
trouble
on
an
offering
you
would
deem
worthless

"
  
<EOS>
He
continue
to
gaze
at
the
picture
:
the
longer
he
look
,
the
firm
he
hold

it

murmur
;

perfect

Would
it
comfort
,
or
would
it
wound
you
to
have
a
similar
painting
?
<EOS>
tell
me
that
.
<EOS>
when
you
be
at
Madagascar
,
or
at
the
Cape
,
or
in
India
,
would
it
be
a
consolation
to
have
that
memento
in
your
possession
?
<EOS>
or
would
the
sight
of
it
bring
recollection
calculate
to
enervate
and
distress
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
furtively
raise
his
eye
:
he
glance
at
me
,
irresolute
,
disturb
:
he
again
survey
the
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
should
like
to
have
it
be
certain
:
whether
it
would
be
judicious
or
wise
be
another
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
since
I
have
ascertain
that
Rosamond
really
prefer
him
,
and
that
her
father
be
not
likely
to
oppose
the
match
,
I
 
less
exalted
in
my
view
than
St.
John
 
have
be
strongly
disposed
in
my
own
heart
to
advocate
their
union
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
,
should
he
become
the
possessor
of
Mr.
Oliver
's
large
fortune
,
he
may
do
as
much
good
with
it
as
if
he
go
and
lay
his
genius
out
to
wither
,
and
his
strength
to
waste
,
under
a
tropical
sun
.
<EOS>
with
this
persuasion
I
now
answer
    
"
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
it
would
be
wise
and
more
judicious
if
you
be
to
take
to
yourself
the
original
at
once

"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
he
have
sit
down
:
he
have
lay
the
picture
on
the
table
before
him
,
and
with
his
brow
support
on
both
hand
,
hang
fondly
over
it
.
<EOS>
I
discern
he
be
now
neither
angry
nor
shocked
at
my
audacity
.
<EOS>
I
see
even
that
to
be
thus
frankly
address
on
a
subject
he
have
deem
unapproachable
 
to
hear
it
thus
freely
handle
 
be
begin
to
be
feel
by
him
as
a
new
pleasure
 
an
unhoped
-
for
relief
.
<EOS>
reserved
people
often
really
need
the
frank
discussion
of
their
sentiment
and
griefs
more
than
the
expansive
.
<EOS>
the
sternest
-
seem
stoic
be
human
after
all
;
and
to
"
burst
"
with
boldness
and
good
-
will
into
"
the
silent
sea
"
of
their
soul
be
often
to
confer
on
them
the
first
of
obligation

<EOS>
"
She
like

I
,
as

her

respect
you

<EOS>
moreover
,
she
be
a
sweet

rather
thoughtless

you

have
sufficient

She
talk

so
much

<EOS>
"
It
be
very
pleasant
to
hear
this
,

he
say
 
"
very
:
go
on
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour

"
<EOS>
and
he
actually
take
out
his
watch
and
lay
it
upon
the
table
to
measure
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
"

where
be
the
use
of
go
on

I
ask
,
"
when
you

<EOS>
"
do
not

such
hard
thing

fancy
me
yield
and
melt

as
I
be
do
:
human
love
rise
like
a
freshly
open
fountain

overflow
with
sweet
inundation
all
the

breathe
fast

low

silent

amidst

down

experience
at

unwarped
consciousness

that

draw
over

the
sheet

what

something
have
catch
his
eye

He
take
it
up
with
a
snatch
;
he
look
at
the
edge
;
then
shoot
a
glance
at
me

inexpressibly
peculiar
,
and
quite
incomprehensible
:
a
glance
that
seem
to
take

make
note
of

face

keen

part

nothing

replace

him
dexterously
tear
a
narrow
slip
from
the
margin

It
disappear

with

in

turn

scrutinise

see
nothing
on
it

a
few
dingy
stain
of
paint
where
I
have
try
the
tint
in

I
ponder
the
mystery
a
minute

two

find
it
insolvable

I
have
close
my
shutter
,
lay
a
mat
to
the
door
to
prevent
the
snow
from
blow
in
under
it

trim
my
fire

after
sit
nearly
an
hour
on
the

to
the
muffled
fury

light
a

take
down

<EOS>
I
soon
forget
storm
in
music

<EOS>
I
hear
a
noise
:
<EOS>
the
wind
,
I
think
,
shake
the
door
.
<EOS>
no
;
it
be
St.
John
Rivers
,
who
,
lift
the
latch
,
come
in
out
of
the
frozen
hurricane
 
the
howling
darkness
 
and
stand
before
me
:
the
cloak
that
cover
his
tall
figure
all
white
as
a
glacier
.
<EOS>
I
be
almost
in
consternation
,
so
little
<EOS>
have
I
expect
any
guest
from
the
block
-
up
vale
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
any
ill
news
?
<EOS>
"
I
demand
.
<EOS>
"
have
anything
happen
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
how
very
easily
alarm
you
be
!
"
<EOS>
he
answer
,
remove
his
cloak
and
hang
it
up
against
the
door
,
towards
which
he
again
coolly
push
the
mat
which
his
entrance
have
derange
.
<EOS>
He
stamp
the
snow
from
his
boot
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
sully
the
purity
of
your
floor
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
you
must
excuse
me
for
once
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
approach
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
hard
work
to
get
here
,
I
assure
you
,

he
observe
,
as
he
warm
his
hand
over
the
flame
.
"
<EOS>
one
drift
take
me
up
to
the
waist
;
happily
the
snow
be
quite
soft
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
be
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
forbear
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
rather
an
inhospitable
question
to
put
to
a
visitor
;
but
since
you
ask
it
,
I
answer
simply
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
;
I
get
tired
of
my
mute
book
and
empty
room
.
<EOS>
besides
,
since
yesterday
I
have
experience
the
excitement
of
a
person
to
whom
a
tale
have
be
half
-
tell
,
and
who
be
impatient
to
hear
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
recall
his
singular
conduct
of
yesterday
,
and
really
I
begin
to
fear
his
wit
be
touch
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
insane
,
however
,
his
be
a
very
cool
and
collected
insanity
:
I
have
never
see
that
handsome
-
feature
face
of
his
look
more
like
chisel
marble
than
it
do
just
now
,
as
he
put
aside
his
snow
-
wet
hair
from
his
forehead
and
let
the
firelight
shine
free
on
his
pale
brow
and
cheek
as
pale
,
where
it
grieve
me
to
discover
the
hollow
trace
of
care
or
sorrow
now
so
plainly
grave
.
<EOS>
I
wait
,
expect
he
would
say
something
I
could
at
least
comprehend
;
but
his
hand
be
now
at
his
chin
,
his
finger
on
his
lip
:
he
be
think
.
<EOS>
It
strike
me
that
his
hand
look
waste
like
his
face
.
<EOS>
a
perhaps
uncalled
-
for
gush
of
pity
come
over
my
heart
:
I
be
move
to
say
    
"
I
wish
Diana
or
Mary
would
come
and
live
with
you
:
<EOS>
it
be
too
bad
that
you
should
be
quite
alone
;
and
you
be
recklessly
rash
about
your
own
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
say
he
:
"
I
care
for
myself
when
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
be
well
now
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
see
amiss
in
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
say
with
a
careless
,
abstract
indifference
,
which
show
that
my
solicitude
be
,
at
least
in
his
opinion
,
wholly
superfluous
.
<EOS>
I
be
silence
.
  
<EOS>
He
still
slowly
move
his
finger
over
his
upper
lip
,
and
still
his
eye
dwell
dreamily
on
the
glowing
grate
;
think
it
urgent
to
say
something
,
I
ask
him
presently
if
he
feel
any
cold
draught
from
the
door
,
which
be
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
respond
shortly
and
somewhat
testily
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
reflect
,
"
if
you
will
not
talk
,
you
may
be
still
;
I
will
let
you
alone
now
,
and
return
to
my
book

"
  
<EOS>
so
I
snuff
the
candle
and
resume
the
perusal
of
"
Marmion
.

<EOS>
He
soon
stir
;
my
eye
be
instantly
draw
to
his
movement
;
he
only
take
out
a
morocco
pocket
-
book
,
thence
produce
a
letter
,
which
he
read
in
silence
,
fold
it
,
put
it
back
,
relapse
into
meditation
.
<EOS>
It
be
vain
to
try
to
read
with
such
an
inscrutable
fixture
before
me
;
nor
could
I
,
in
impatience
,
consent
to
be
dumb
;
he
may
rebuff
me
if
he
like
,
but
talk
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
from
Diana

Mary

good

<EOS>
baffle
so
far
,
I
change
my
ground
.
<EOS>
I
bethink
myself
to
talk
about
the
school
and
my
scholar

again
come
the
blank
of
a
pause
:
the
clock
strike
eight
stroke

It
arouse
him

he
uncross
his

sit
erect

turn
to
me

wondering

I

I
speak

convert

before
commence

it
be

fair
to
warn
you
that
the
story
will
sound
somewhat
hackneye
in

regain
a
degree
of
freshness
when
they
pass
through

for

<EOS>
"
twenty
year

a
poor
curate
 
never
mind
his

at
this

fall
in

with
a
rich

she
fall
in

and
marry

against
the
advice

all
her

who
consequently
disown
her
immediately
after
the
wedding

<EOS>
before
two
year
pass

the
rash
pair
be
both
dead

and
lay
quietly
side
by

under
one
slab

<EOS>
(
I

Mrs.

You

<EOS>
do
you
hear
a
noise
?
<EOS>
I
daresay
it
be
only
a
rat
scrambling
along
the
rafter
of
the
adjoin
schoolroom
<EOS>

it
be
a

Mrs.

whether

happy

I
can
not

at

to
a
place

you
know
 
be
no
other
than
Lowood
School

where
you
so
long

It
seem
her
career

be
very
honourable

from
a
pupil

she
become
a

like
yourself

strike
me
there
be
parallel
point
in

a
governess

there

your
fate

analogous

undertake
the
education
of
the
ward
of
a
certain
Mr.

"
Mr.

I
interrupt

<EOS>
"
I
can
guess
your

he
say
,

but
restrain
them
for
a
while
:
I
have
nearly
finish
;
hear
me
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
character
I
know
nothing
,
but
the
one
fact
that
he
profess
to
offer
honourable
marriage
to
this
young
girl
,
and
that
at
the
very
altar
she
discover
he
have
a
wife
yet
alive
,
though
a
lunatic

<EOS>
what
his
subsequent
conduct
and
proposal
be
be
a
matter
of
pure
conjecture

but
when
an
event
transpired
which
render
inquiry
after
the
governess
necessary

it
be
discover
she
be
go
 
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
She
have
leave
Thornfield
Hall
in

every
research
after

course
have
be
vain
:
the
country
have
be
scour
far

wide
;
no
vestige
of
information
could
be
gather
respect
her

<EOS>
yet
that
she
should
be
find
be
become
a
matter

serious
urgency

what

I
be
ignorant
of

the

never
mention
him

to
narrate
the
fraudulent
and
illegal
attempt
I
have
advert
to
.
<EOS>
You
should
rather
ask
the
name
of

the
nature

who

Mr.

intimate

it

Alice
Fairfax

I
feel
cold
and
dismayed
:
my
bad
fear
then
be
probably
true
:
he
have
in
all
probability
leave
England
and
rush
in
reckless
desperation
to
some
former
haunt
on
the
Continent

what
opiate
for
his
severe
suffering
 
<EOS>
what
object
for
his
strong
passion
 
have
he
seek
there
?
<EOS>
I
dare
not

the
question

<EOS>
oh

my

very
well

answer
quietly

and
the
pocket

be
again
deliberately
produce

open

seek
through

from
one
of
its
compartment
be
extract
a
shabby

I
recognise
in

<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
thing
,
reader
,
to
be
lift
in
a
moment
from
indigence
to
wealth
 
a
very
fine
thing
;
but
not
a
matter
one
can
comprehend
,
or
consequently
enjoy
,
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
other
chance
in
life
far
more
thrilling
and
rapture
-
giving
:
_
<EOS>
this
_
be
solid
,
an
affair
of
the
actual
world
,
nothing
ideal
about
it
:
all
its
association
be
solid
and
sober
,
and
its
manifestation
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
one
do
not
jump
,
and
spring
,
and
shout
hurrah
!
<EOS>
at
hear
one
have
get
a
fortune
;
one
begin
to
consider
responsibility
,
and
to
ponder
business
;
on
a
base
of
steady
satisfaction
rise
certain
grave
care
,
and
we
contain
ourselves
,
and
brood
over
our
bliss
with
a
solemn
brow
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
the
word
Legacy
,
Bequest
,
go
side
by
side
with
the
word
,
death
,
Funeral
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
I
have
hear
be
dead
 
my
only
relative
;
ever
since
be
make
aware
of
his
existence
,
I
have
cherish
the
hope
of
one
day
see
him
:
now
,
I
never
should
.
<EOS>
and
then
this
money
come
only
to
me
:
not
to
me
and
a
rejoice
family
,
but
to
my
isolated
self
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
grand
boon
doubtless
;
and
independence
would
be
glorious
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
feel
that
 
that
thought
swell
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
unbend
your
forehead
at
last

"
say
Mr.
Rivers
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Medusa
have
look
at
you

that
you

<EOS>
perhaps
now
you
will
ask
how
much
you
be
worth

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
how

be
I
worth

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

a

!
<EOS>
nothing
of

to

what
be
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
twenty

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
new
stunner
 
I
have
be
calculate
on
four
or
five
thousand
.
<EOS>
this
news
actually
take
my
breath
for
a
moment
:
<EOS>
Mr.
St.
John
,
whom
I
have
never
hear
laugh
before
,
laugh
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
well

"
say
he
,
"
if
you
have
commit
a
murder
,
and
I
have
tell
you
your
crime

,
you
could
scarcely
look
more
aghast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
large
sum
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
there
be
a
mistake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
mistake
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
have
read
the
figure
wrong
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
two
thousand

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
write
in
letter

not

twenty
thousand

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
again
feel
rather
like
an
individual
of
but
average
gastronomical
power
sit
down
to
feast
alone
at
a
table
spread
with
provision
for
a
hundred

<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
rise
now
and
put
his
cloak
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
not
such
a
very
wild
night

"
he
say
,
"
I
would
send
Hannah
down
to
keep
you
company
:
you
look
too
desperately
miserable

leave
alone

<EOS>
but
Hannah
,
poor
woman

<EOS>
could
not
stride
the
drift
so
well

I
:

her

good

<EOS>
He
be

the
latch
:
a
sudden

occur
to
me

"
<EOS>
stop
one
minute
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
puzzle
me
to
know
why
Mr.
Briggs
write
to
you
about
me
;
or
how
he
know
you
,
or
could
fancy
that
you
,
live
in
such
an
out

of

the
power

aid
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
be
a

he

the

often

<EOS>
again
the

rattle

<EOS>
"
no

that
do
not
satisfy
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
:
and
indeed
there
be
something
in
the
hasty
and
unexplanatory
reply
which
,
instead
of
allay
,
pique
my
curiosity
more
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
very
strange
piece
of
business

I
add
;

I
must
know
more
about
it

another
time

<EOS>
"
no

to

night

<EOS>
and
as
he
turn
from
the
door
,
I
place
myself
between
it
and
him

<EOS>
He
look
rather
embarrassed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
shall
not
go
till
you
have
tell
me
all

I

of
course
these
objection
work
my
eagerness
to
a
climax

gratify
it
must
be

that
without

I
tell

so

tranquillise

and
what
sort
of
an
effect
will
the
bequest
have
on
you
?
<EOS>
Will
it
keep
you
in
England
,
induce
you
to
marry
Miss
Oliver

and
settle
down
like
an
ordinary
mortal
?

"
You
wander

<EOS>
Mr.
Rivers
!
<EOS>
you
quite
put
me
out
of
patience
:
I
be
rational
enough
;
it
be
you
who
misunderstand
,
or
rather
who
affect
to
misunderstand
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
if
you
explain
yourself
a
little
more
fully
,
I
should
comprehend
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
explain
!
<EOS>
what
be
there
to
explain
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
fail
to
see
that
twenty
thousand
pound
,
the
sum
in
question
,
divide
equally
between
the
nephew
and
three
niece
of
our
uncle
,
<EOS>
will
give
five
thousand

each

<EOS>
what
I
want
be
,
that
you
should
write
to
your
sister
and
tell
them
of
the
fortune
that
have
accrue
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
you
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
intimate
my
view
of
the
case
:
I
be
incapable
of
take
any
other
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
brutally
selfish
,
blindly
unjust
,
or
fiendishly
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
be
resolve
I
will
have
a
home
and
connection
.
<EOS>
I
like
Moor
House
,
and
I
will
live
at
Moor
House
;
I
like
Diana
and
Mary
,
and
I
will
attach
myself
for
life
to
Diana
and
Mary
.
<EOS>
It
would
please
and
benefit
me
to
have
five
thousand
pound
;
it
would
torment
and
oppress
me
to
have
twenty
thousand
;
which
,
moreover
,
could
never
be
mine
in
justice
,
though
it
may
in
law
.
<EOS>
I
abandon
to
you
,
then
,
what
be
absolutely
superfluous
to
me
.
<EOS>
let
there
be
no
opposition
,
and
no
discussion
about
it
;
let
us
agree
amongst
each
other
,
and
decide
the
point
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
act
on
first
impulse
;
you
must
take
day
to
consider
such
a
matter
,
ere
your
word
can
be
regard
as
valid
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
all
you
doubt
be
my
sincerity

I
be
easy
:
you
see
the
justice
of
the
case
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
_
do
_
see
a

justice

<EOS>
after
all
,
justice
permit
you
to
keep
it

with

consider
it
absolutely

it

indulge
my

an
opportunity

so

somewhat
when

be

to
afford
a
vent

the
unusual
ebullition

pleasure

that
consciousness

manifest
their

plainly

strongly

deep
be
my
gratification
to
find
I
have
really
a
place
in

never

should
pass
in

an
hour

well

inform

the
good

best
mannered

most
self
-
respecting
of
any

since
those

clean
down

my
next
to
rub
it
up
with
bee
-
wax
,
oil
,
and
an
indefinite
number
of
cloth

till
it
glitter
again

my
third
,
to
arrange
every
chair

table

bed

precision

afterwards
I
shall
go
near
to
ruin
you

coal

peat

keep
up
good
fire
in
every
room

and
lastly
,
the
two
day
precede
that
on
which
your
sister
be
expect
will
be
devote
by
Hannah

me
to
such
a
beating
of
egg

sort
of
currant
,
grating
of
spice

compound
of
Christmas
cake

chop
up

solemnising

culinary
rite

an
inadequate

you

My
purpose

in

be
to
have
all
thing
in
an
absolutely
perfect
state
of
readiness

Diana

Mary
before
next
Thursday

St.

I

wicked

I

you

up

Happy
at
Moor
House
I
be
,
and
hard
I
work
;
and
so
do
Hannah
:
<EOS>
she
be
charm
to
see
how
jovial
I
could
be
amidst
the
bustle
of
a
house
turn
topsy
-
turvy
 
<EOS>
how
I
could
brush
,
and
dust
,
and
clean
,
and
cook
.
<EOS>
and
really
,
after
a
day
or
two
of
confusion
bad
confound
,
it
be
delightful
by
degree
to
invoke
order
from
the
chaos
ourselves
have
make
.
<EOS>
I
have
previously
take
a
journey
to
S
to
purchase
some
new
furniture
:
my
cousin
have
give
me
_
carte
blanche
_
<EOS>
to
effect
what
alteration
I
please
,
and
a
sum
have
be
set
aside
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
ordinary
sitting
-
room
and
bedroom
<EOS>
I
leave
much
as
they
be
:
for
I
know
Diana
and
Mary
would
derive
more
pleasure
from
see
again
the
old
homely
table
,
and
chair
,
and
bed
,
than
from
the
spectacle
of
the
smart
innovation
.
<EOS>
still
some
novelty
be
necessary
,
to
give
to
their
return
the
piquancy
with
which
I
wish
it
to
be
invest
.
<EOS>
Dark
handsome
new
carpet
and
curtain
,
an
arrangement
of
some
carefully
select
antique
ornament
in
porcelain
and
bronze
,
new
covering
,
and
mirror
,
and
dressing
-
case
,
for
the
toilet
table
,
answer
the
end
:
they
look
fresh
without
be
glare
.
<EOS>
a
spare
parlour
and
bedroom
<EOS>
I
refurnish
entirely
,
with
old
mahogany
and
crimson
upholstery
:
I
lay
canvas
on
the
passage
,
and
carpet
on
the
stair
.
<EOS>
when
all
be
finish
,
I
think
Moor
House
as
complete
a
model
of
bright
modest
snugness
within
,
as
it
be
,
at
this
season
,
a
speciman
of
wintry
waste
and
desert
dreariness
without
.
  
<EOS>
the
eventful
Thursday
at
length
come
.
<EOS>
They
be
expect
about
dark
,
and
ere
dusk
fire
be
light
upstairs
and
below
;
the
kitchen
be
in
perfect
trim
;
Hannah
and
I
be
dress
,
and
all
be
in
readiness
.
  
<EOS>
St.
John
arrive
first
.
<EOS>
I
have
entreat
him
to
keep
quite
clear
of
the
house
till
everything
be
arrange
:
and
,
indeed
,
the
bare
idea
of
the
commotion
,
at
once
sordid
and
trivial
,
go
on
within
its
wall
suffice
to
scare
him
to
estrangement
.
<EOS>
He
find
me
in
the
kitchen
,
watch
the
progress
of
certain
cake
for
tea
,
then
bake
.
<EOS>
approach
the
hearth
,
he
ask
,
"
if
I
be
at
last
satisfied
with
housemaid
's
work
?
"
<EOS>
I
answer
by
invite
him
to
accompany
me
on
a
general
inspection
of
the
result
of
my
labour
.
<EOS>
with
some
difficulty
,
I
get
him
to
make
the
tour
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
just
look
in
at
the
door
I
open
;
and
when
he
have
wander
upstairs
and
downstairs
,
he
say
I
must
have
go
through
a
great
deal
of
fatigue
and
trouble
to
have
effect
such
considerable
change
in
so
short
a
time
:
<EOS>
but
not
a
syllable
<EOS>
do
he
utter
indicate
pleasure
in
the
improved
aspect
of
his
abode
.
  
<EOS>
this
silence
damp
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
perhaps
the
alteration
have
disturb
some
old
association
he
value
.
<EOS>
I
inquire
whether
this
be
the
case
:
no
doubt
in
a
somewhat
crest
-
fall
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
;
he
have
,
on
the
contrary
,
remark
that
I
have
scrupulously
respect
every
association
:
he
fear
,
indeed
,
I
must
have
bestow
more
thought
on
the
matter
than
it
be
worth
.
<EOS>
how
many
minute
,
for
instance
,
have
I
devote
to
study
the
arrangement
of
this
very
room
?
 
<EOS>
by
-
the
-
bye
,
could
I
tell
him
where
such
a
book
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
show
him
the
volume
on
the
shelf
:
he
take
it
down
,
and
withdraw
to
his
accustomed
window
recess
,
he
begin
to
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
I
do
not
like
this
,
reader
.
<EOS>
St.
John
be
a
good
man
;
but
I
begin
to
feel
he
have
speak
truth
of
himself
when
he
say
he
be
hard
and
cold
.
<EOS>
the
humanity
and
amenity
of
life
have
no
attraction
for
him
 
<EOS>
its
peaceful
enjoyment
no
charm
.
<EOS>
literally
,
he
live
only
to
aspire
 
after
what
be
good
and
great
,
certainly
;
but
still
he
would
never
rest
,
nor
approve
of
other
rest
round
him
.
<EOS>
as
I
look
at
his
lofty
forehead
,
still
and
pale
as
a
white
stone
 
at
his
fine
lineament
fix
in
study
 
<EOS>
I
comprehend
all
at
once
that
he
would
hardly
make
a
good
husband
:
that
it
would
be
a
try
thing
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
understand
,
as
by
inspiration
,
the
nature
of
his
love
for
Miss
Oliver
;
I
agree
with
him
that
it
be
but
a
love
of
the
sense
.
<EOS>
I
comprehend
how
he
should
despise
himself
for
the
feverish
influence
it
exercise
over
him
;
how
he
should
wish
to
stifle
and
destroy
it
;
how
he
should
mistrust
its
ever
conduct
permanently
to
his
happiness
or
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
he
be
of
the
material
from
which
nature
hew
her
hero
 
<EOS>
Christian
and
Pagan
 
<EOS>
her
lawgiver
,
her
statesman
,
her
conqueror
:
a
steadfast
bulwark
for
great
interest
to
rest
upon
;
but
,
at
the
fireside
,
too
often
a
cold
cumbrous
column
,
gloomy
and
out
of
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
parlour
be
not
his
sphere
,
"
<EOS>
I
reflect
:
"
the
Himalayan
ridge
or
Caffre
bush
,
even
the
plague
-
curse
Guinea
Coast
swamp
would
suit
him
better
.
<EOS>
well
may
he
eschew
the
calm
of
domestic
life
;
it
be
not
his
element
:
there
his
faculty
stagnate
 
they
can
not
develop
or
appear
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
scene
of
strife
and
danger
 
<EOS>
where
courage
be
prove
,
and
energy
exercise
,
and
fortitude
task
 
that
he
will
speak
and
move
,
the
leader
and
superior
.
<EOS>
a
merry
child
would
have
the
advantage
of
him
on
this
hearth
.
<EOS>
He
be
right
to
choose
a
missionary
's
career
 
I
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
come
!
<EOS>
they
be
come
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Hannah
,
throw
open
the
parlour
door
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
old
Carlo
bark
joyfully
.
<EOS>
out
I
run
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
dark
;
but
a
rumbling
of
wheel
be
audible
.
<EOS>
Hannah
soon
have
a
lantern
light
.
<EOS>
the
vehicle
have
stop
at
the
wicket
;
the
driver
open
the
door
:
first
one
well
-
know
form
,
then
another
,
step
out
.
<EOS>
in
a
minute
I
have
my
face
under
their
bonnet
,
in
contact
first
with
Mary
's
soft
cheek
,
then
with
Diana
's
flow
curl
.
<EOS>
They
laugh
 
<EOS>
kiss
me
 
then
Hannah
:
<EOS>
pat
Carlo
,
who
be
half
wild
with
delight
;
ask
eagerly
if
all
be
well
;
and
be
assure
in
the
affirmative
,
hasten
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
stiff
with
their
long
and
jolt
drive
from
Whitcross
,
and
chill
with
the
frosty
night
air
;
but
their
pleasant
countenance
expand
to
the
cheerful
firelight
.
<EOS>
while
the
driver
and
Hannah
bring
in
the
box
,
they
demand
St.
John
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
he
advance
from
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
They
both
throw
their
arm
round
his
neck
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
give
each
one
quiet
kiss
,
say
in
a
low
tone
a
few
word
of
welcome
,
stand
a
while
to
be
talk
to
,
and
then
,
intimate
that
he
suppose
they
would
soon
rejoin
him
in
the
parlour
,
withdraw
there
as
to
a
place
of
refuge
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
light
their
candle
to
go
upstairs
,
but
Diana
have
first
to
give
hospitable
order
respect
the
driver
;
this
do
,
both
follow
me
.
<EOS>
They
be
delight
with
the
renovation
and
decoration
of
their
room
;
with
the
new
drapery
,
and
fresh
carpet
,
and
rich
tint
china
vase
:
they
express
their
gratification
ungrudgingly
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
pleasure
of
feeling
that
my
arrangement
meet
their
wish
exactly
,
and
that
what
I
have
do
add
a
vivid
charm
to
their
joyous
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
Sweet
be
that
evening
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
,
full
of
exhilaration
,
be
so
eloquent
in
narrative
and
comment
,
that
their
fluency
cover
St.
John
's
taciturnity
:
he
be
sincerely
glad
to
see
his
sister
;
but
in
their
glow
of
fervour
and
flow
of
joy
he
could
not
sympathise
.
<EOS>
the
event
of
the
day
 
that
is
,
the
return
of
Diana
and
Mary
 
please
him
;
but
the
accompaniment
of
that
event
,
the
glad
tumult
,
the
garrulous
glee
of
reception
irk
him
:
I
see
he
wish
the
calm
morrow
be
come
.
<EOS>
in
the
very
meridian
of
the
night
's
enjoyment
,
about
an
hour
after
tea
,
a
rap
be
hear
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Hannah
enter
with
the
intimation
that
"
a
poor
lad
be
come
,
at
that
unlikely
time
,
to
fetch
Mr.
Rivers
to
see
his
mother
,
who
be
draw
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
she
live
,
Hannah
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
clear
up
at
Whitcross
Brow
,
almost
four
mile
off
,
and
moor
and
moss
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
him
I
will
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
you
have
well
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
bad
road
to
travel
after
dark
that
can
be
:
there
be
no
track
at
all
over
the
bog
.
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
such
a
bitter
night
 
<EOS>
the
keen
wind
you
ever
feel
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
send
word
,
sir
,
that
you
will
be
there
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
already
in
the
passage
,
put
on
his
cloak
;
and
without
one
objection
,
one
murmur
,
he
depart
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
nine
o'clock
:
he
do
not
return
till
midnight
.
<EOS>
starve
and
tired
enough
<EOS>
he
be
:
<EOS>
but
he
look
happy
than
when
he
set
out
.
<EOS>
He
have
perform
an
act
of
duty
;
make
an
exertion
;
feel
his
own
strength
to
do
and
deny
,
and
be
on
well
term
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
the
whole
of
the
ensue
week
try
his
patience
.
<EOS>
It
be
Christmas
week
:
we
take
to
no
settle
employment
,
but
spend
it
in
a
sort
of
merry
domestic
dissipation
.
<EOS>
the
air
of
the
moor
,
the
freedom
of
home
,
the
dawn
of
prosperity
,
act
on
Diana
and
Mary
's
spirit
like
some
life
-
give
elixir
<EOS>
:
they
be
gay
from
morning
till
noon
,
and
from
noon
till
night
.
<EOS>
They
could
always
talk
;
and
their
discourse
,
witty
,
pithy
,
original
,
have
such
charm
for
me
,
that
I
prefer
listen
to
,
and
share
in
it
,
to
do
anything
else
.
<EOS>
St.
John
do
not
rebuke
our
vivacity
;
but
he
escape
from
it
:
he
be
seldom
in
the
house
;
his
parish
be
large
,
the
population
scatter
,
and
he
find
daily
business
in
visit
the
sick
and
poor
in
its
different
district
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
at
breakfast
,
Diana
,
after
look
a
little
pensive
for
some
minute
,
ask
him
,
"
if
his
plan
be
yet
unchanged
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
unchanged
and
unchangeable
,
"
be
the
reply
.
<EOS>
and
he
proceed
to
inform
us
that
his
departure
from
England
be
now
definitively
fix
for
the
ensue
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
Rosamond
Oliver

suggest
Mary

the
word

to
escape
her

involuntarily
:
for
no
sooner

she
utter
them

than
she
make
a

as

recall
them

<EOS>
St.
John
have
a
book
in
his
hand
 
<EOS>
it
be
his
unsocial
custom
to
read
at
meal
 
<EOS>
he
close
it
,
and
look
up

<EOS>
"
Rosamond
Oliver

"

he

"
be
about

Mr.

His

look
at

serene
as

"
the
match
must
have

up
hastily

Diana

"
they

<EOS>
but
two
month
:
they
meet
in
October
at

county
ball
at

where
there
be
no
obstacle

a
union

in

where
the
connection
be
in
every
point
desirable

unnecessary

they
will
be
marry
as
soon
as
S
Place

which
Sir
Frederic
give
up
to
them
,
can
he
refit
for
their
reception
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
first
time
I
find
St.
John
alone
after
this
communication
,
I
feel
tempt
to
inquire
if
the
event
distress
him
:
but
he
seem
so
little
to
need
sympathy
,
that
,
so
far
from
venture
to
offer
him
more
,
I
experience
some
shame
at
the
recollection
of
what
I
have
already
hazard
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
be
out
of
practice
in
talk
to
him
:
his
reserve
be
again
freeze
over
,
and
my
frankness
be
congeal
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
keep
his
promise
of
treat
me
like
his
sister
;
he
continually
make
little
chilling
difference
between
us
,
which
do
not
at
all
tend
to
the
development
of
cordiality
:
in
short
,
now
that
I
be
acknowledge
his
kinswoman
,
and
live
under
the
same
roof
with
him
,
I
feel
the
distance
between
us
to
be
far
great
than
when
he
have
know
me
only
as
the
village
schoolmistress
.
<EOS>
when
I
remember
how
far
I
have
once
be
admit
to
his
confidence
,
I
could
hardly
comprehend
his
present
frigidity
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
case
,
I
feel
not
a
little
surprised
when
he
raise
his
head
suddenly
from
the
desk
over
which
he
be
stoop
,
and
say
    
"
You
see
,
Jane
,
the
battle
be
fight
and
the
victory
win
.
"
  
<EOS>
startle
at
be
thus
address
,
I
do
not
immediately
reply
:
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
I
answer
    
"
<EOS>
but
be
you
sure
you
be
not
in
the
position
of
those
conqueror
whose
triumph
have
cost
them
too
dear
?
<EOS>
Would
not
such
another
ruin
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
;
and
if
I
be
,
it
do
not
much
signify
;
I
shall
never
be
call
upon
to
contend
for
such
another
.
<EOS>
the
event
of
the
conflict
be
decisive
:
my
way
be
now
clear
;
I
thank
God
for
it
!
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
return
to
his
paper
and
his
silence
.
  
<EOS>
as
our
mutual
happiness
(
_
i.e.
_
,
Diana
's
,
Mary
's
,
and
mine
)
settle
into
a
quieter
character
,
and
we
resume
our
usual
habit
and
regular
study
,
St.
John
stay
more
at
home
:
he
sit
with
us
in
the
same
room
,
sometimes
for
hour
together
.
<EOS>
while
Mary
draw
,
Diana
pursue
a
course
of
encyclopaedic
reading
she
have
(
to
my
awe
and
amazement
)
undertaken
,
and
I
fag
away
at
German
,
he
ponder
a
mystic
lore
of
his
own
:
that
of
some
eastern
tongue
,
the
acquisition
of
which
he
think
necessary
to
his
plan
.
  
<EOS>
thus
engage
,
he
appear
,
sit
in
his
own
recess
,
quiet
and
absorb
enough
;
but
that
blue
eye
of
his
have
a
habit
of
leave
the
outlandish-
look
grammar
,
and
wander
over
,
and
sometimes
fix
upon
us
,
his
fellow
-
student
,
with
a
curious
intensity
of
observation
:
if
catch
,
it
would
be
instantly
withdraw
;
yet
ever
and
anon
,
it
return
searchingly
to
our
table
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
it
mean
:
I
wonder
,
too
,
at
the
punctual
satisfaction
he
never
fail
to
exhibit
on
an
occasion
that
seem
to
me
of
small
moment
,
namely
,
my
weekly
visit
to
Morton
school
;
and
still
more
be
I
puzzle
when
,
if
the
day
be
unfavourable
,
if
there
be
snow
,
or
rain
,
or
high
wind
,
and
his
sister
urge
me
not
to
go
,
he
would
invariably
make
light
of
their
solicitude
,
and
encourage
me
to
accomplish
the
task
without
regard
to
the
element
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
be
not
such
a
weakling
as
you
would
make
her
,
"
he
would
say
:
"
she
can
bear
a
mountain
blast
,
or
a
shower
,
or
a
few
flake
of
snow
,
as
well
as
any
of
us
.
<EOS>
Her
constitution
be
both
sound
and
elastic
;
 
better
calculate
to
endure
variation
of
climate
than
many
more
robust
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
when
I
return
,
sometimes
a
good
deal
tired
,
and
not
a
little
weather
-
beat
,
I
never
dare
complain
,
because
I
see
that
to
murmur
would
be
to
vex
him
:
on
all
occasion
fortitude
please
him
;
the
reverse
be
a
special
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
however
,
I
get
leave
to
stay
at
home
,
because
I
really
have
a
cold
.
<EOS>
His
sister
be
go
to
Morton
in
my
stead
:
I
sit
read
Schiller
;
he
,
decipher
his
crabbed
oriental
scroll
.
<EOS>
as
I
exchange
a
translation
for
an
exercise
,
I
happen
to
look
his
way
:
there
I
find
myself
under
the
influence
of
the
ever
-
watchful
blue
eye
.
<EOS>
how
long
it
have
be
search
me
through
and
through
,
and
over
and
over
,
I
can
not
tell
:
<EOS>
so
keen
be
it
,
and
yet
so
cold
<EOS>
,
I
feel
for
the
moment
superstitious
 
as
if
I
be
sit
in
the
room
with
something
uncanny
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
what
be
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
learn
german
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
give
up
german
and
learn
Hindostanee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
in
earnest
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
such
earnest
that
I
must
have
it
so
:
and
I
will
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
go
on
to
explain
that
Hindostanee
be
the
language
he
be
himself
at
present
studying
;
that
,
as
he
advance
,
he
be
apt
to
forget
the
commencement
;
that
it
would
assist
him
greatly
to
have
a
pupil
with
whom
he
may
again
and
again
go
over
the
element
,
and
so
fix
them
thoroughly
in
his
mind
;
that
his
choice
have
hover
for
some
time
between
me
and
his
sister
;
but
that
he
have
fix
on
me
because
he
see
I
could
sit
at
a
task
the
long
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
Would
I
do
him
this
favour
?
<EOS>
I
should
not
,
perhaps
,
have
to
make
the
sacrifice
long
,
as
it
want
now
barely
three
month
to
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
St.
John
be
not
a
man
to
be
lightly
refuse
:
you
feel
that
every
impression
make
on
him
,
either
for
pain
or
pleasure
,
be
deep
-
graved
and
permanent
.
<EOS>
I
consent
.
<EOS>
when
Diana
and
Mary
return
,
the
former
find
her
scholar
transfer
from
her
to
her
brother
:
she
laugh
,
and
both
she
and
Mary
agree
that
St.
John
should
never
have
persuade
them
to
such
a
step
.
<EOS>
He
answer
quietly
    
"
I
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
find
him
a
very
patient
,
very
forbearing
,
and
yet
an
exact
master
:
he
expect
me
to
do
a
great
deal
;
and
when
I
fulfil
his
expectation
,
he
,
in
his
own
way
,
fully
testify
his
approbation
.
<EOS>
by
degree
,
he
acquire
a
certain
influence
over
me
that
take
away
my
liberty
of
mind
:
his
praise
and
notice
be
more
restrain
than
his
indifference
.
<EOS>
I
could
no
longer
talk
or
laugh
freely
when
he
be
by
,
because
a
tiresomely
importunate
instinct
remind
me
that
vivacity
(
at
least
in
me
)
be
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
fully
aware
that
only
serious
mood
and
occupation
be
acceptable
,
that
in
his
presence
every
effort
to
sustain
or
follow
any
other
become
vain
<EOS>
:
I
fall
under
a
freezing
spell
.
<EOS>
when
he
say
"
go
,
"
I
go
;
"
come
,
"
I
come
;
"
<EOS>
do
this
,
"
I
do
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
love
my
servitude
:
I
wish
,
many
a
time
,
he
have
continue
to
neglect
me
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
when
,
at
bedtime
,
his
sister
and
I
stand
round
him
,
bid
him
good
-
night
,
he
kiss
each
of
them
,
as
be
his
custom
;
and
,
as
be
equally
his
custom
,
he
give
me
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Diana
,
who
chance
to
be
in
a
frolicsome
humour
<EOS>
(
_
<EOS>
she
_
be
not
painfully
control
by
his
will
;
for
hers
,
in
another
way
,
be
as
strong
)
,
exclaim
    
"
St.
John
!
<EOS>
you
use
to
call
Jane
your
third
sister
,
but
you
do
not
treat
her
as
such
:
you
should
kiss
her
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
push
me
towards
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
Diana
very
provoking
,
and
feel
uncomfortably
confused
;
and
while
I
be
thus
think
and
feeling
,
St.
John
bend
his
head
;
his
greek
face
be
bring
to
a
level
with
mine
,
his
eye
question
my
eye
<EOS>
piercingly
 
he
kiss
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
thing
as
marble
kiss
or
ice
kiss
,
or
I
should
say
my
ecclesiastical
cousin
's
salute
belong
to
one
of
these
class
;
but
there
may
be
experiment
kiss
,
and
his
be
an
experiment
kiss
.
<EOS>
when
give
,
he
view
me
to
learn
the
result
;
it
be
not
strike
:
I
be
sure
I
do
not
blush
;
perhaps
I
may
have
turn
a
little
pale
,
for
I
feel
as
if
this
kiss
be
a
seal
affix
to
my
fetter
.
<EOS>
He
never
omit
the
ceremony
afterwards
,
and
the
gravity
and
quiescence
with
which
I
undergo
it
,
seem
to
invest
it
for
him
with
a
certain
charm
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
daily
wish
more
to
please
him
;
but
to
do
so
,
I
feel
daily
more
and
more
that
I
must
disown
half
my
nature
,
stifle
half
my
faculty
,
wrest
my
taste
from
their
original
bent
,
force
myself
to
the
adoption
of
pursuit
for
which
I
have
no
natural
vocation
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
train
me
to
an
elevation
I
could
never
reach
;
it
rack
me
hourly
to
aspire
to
the
standard
he
uplift
.
<EOS>
the
thing
be
as
impossible
as
to
mould
my
irregular
feature
to
his
correct
and
classic
pattern
,
to
give
to
my
changeable
green
eye
the
sea
-
blue
tint
and
solemn
lustre
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
not
his
ascendancy
alone
,
however
,
hold
me
in
thrall
at
present
.
<EOS>
of
late
it
have
be
easy
enough
for
me
to
look
sad
:
a
canker
evil
sit
at
my
heart
and
drain
my
happiness
at
its
source
 
the
evil
of
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
you
think
I
have
forget
Mr.
Rochester
,
reader
,
amidst
these
change
of
place
and
fortune
.
<EOS>
not
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
His
idea
be
still
with
me
,
because
it
be
not
a
vapour
sunshine
could
disperse
,
nor
a
sand
-
trace
effigy
storm
could
wash
away
;
it
be
a
name
grave
on
a
tablet
,
fate
to
last
as
long
as
the
marble
it
inscribe
.
<EOS>
the
craving
to
know
what
have
become
of
him
follow
me
everywhere
;
when
I
be
at
Morton
,
I
re
-
enter
my
cottage
every
evening
to
think
of
that
;
and
now
at
Moor
House
,
I
seek
my
bedroom
each
night
to
brood
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
my
necessary
correspondence
with
Mr.
Briggs
about
the
will
,
I
have
inquire
if
he
know
anything
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
present
residence
and
state
of
health
;
but
,
as
St.
John
have
conjecture
,
he
be
quite
ignorant
of
all
concern
him
.
<EOS>
I
then
write
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
entreat
information
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
have
calculate
with
certainty
on
this
step
answer
my
end
:
I
feel
sure
it
would
elicit
an
early
answer
.
<EOS>
I
be
astonish
when
a
fortnight
pass
without
reply
;
but
when
two
month
wear
away
,
and
day
after
day
the
post
arrive
and
bring
nothing
for
me
,
I
fall
a
prey
to
the
keen
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
I
write
again
:
there
be
a
chance
of
my
first
letter
have
miss
.
<EOS>
renew
hope
follow
renew
effort
:
it
shine
like
the
former
for
some
week
,
then
,
like
it
<EOS>
,
it
fade
,
flicker
:
not
<EOS>
a
line
,
not
a
word
reach
me
.
<EOS>
when
half
a
year
waste
in
vain
expectancy
,
my
hope
die
out
,
and
then
I
feel
dark
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
a
fine
spring
shone
round
me
,
which
I
could
not
enjoy
.
<EOS>
summer
approach
;
Diana
try
to
cheer
me
:
she
say
I
look
ill
,
and
wish
to
accompany
me
to
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
this
St.
John
oppose
;
he
say
I
do
not
want
dissipation
<EOS>
,
I
want
employment
;
my
present
life
be
too
purposeless
<EOS>
,
I
require
an
aim

and

I
suppose

by
way
of

still
further
my
lesson
in
Hindostanee

and

more
urgent

their
accomplishment

and
I
,
like
a
fool
,
never
think
of

him
 
I
could
not
resist
him
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
I
have
come
to
my
study
in
low
spirit
than
usual
;
the
ebb
be
occasion
by
a
poignantly
feel
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Hannah
have
tell
me
in
the
morning
there
be
a
letter
for
me
,
and
when
I
go
down
to
take
it
,
almost
certain
that
the
long
-
look
for
tiding
be
vouchsafe
me
at
last
,
I
find
only
an
unimportant
note
from
Mr.
Briggs
on
business
.
<EOS>
the
bitter
check
have
wrung
from
me
some
tear
;
and
now
,
as
I
sit
pore
over
the
crabbed
character
and
flourish
trope
of
an
indian
scribe
,
my
eye
fill
again
.
  
<EOS>
St.
John
call
me
to
his
side
to
read
;
in
attempt
to
do
this
my
voice
fail
me
:
word
be
lose
in
sobs
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
be
the
only
occupant
of
the
parlour
:
<EOS>
Diana
be
practise
her
music
in
the
drawing

room
,
Mary
be
garden
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
very
fine
May
day
,
clear
,
sunny
,
and
breezy
.
<EOS>
My
companion
express
no
surprise
at
this
emotion
,
nor
do
he
question
me
as
to
its
cause
;
he
only
say
    
"
We
will
wait
a
few
minute
,
Jane
,
till
you
be
more
composed
.
"
<EOS>
and
while
I
smother
the
paroxysm
with
all
haste
,
he
sit
calm
and
patient
,
lean
on
his
desk
,
and
look
like
a
physician
watch
with
the
eye
of
science
an
expect

fully

crisis
in
a
patient

malady

<EOS>
have
stifle
my
sobs
,
wipe
my
eye

and
mutter
something
about
not
be
very
well
that
morning
,
I
resume
my

it

<EOS>
St.

put

in

have
know
any
medium
in
my
dealing
with
positive
,
hard
character

antagonistic

submission

I
have
always
faithfully
observe
the
one
,
up
to
the

moment
of
burst
,
sometimes
with
volcanic
vehemence
,
into
the
other

as
neither

warrant

nor
my
present
mood
incline
me
to
mutiny

I
observe
careful
obedience
to
St.

's
direction
;
and
in
ten
minute
I
be
tread
the
wild
track
of
the
glen
,
side
by
side
with
him
.

the

be
from

west
:
it
come
over
the
hill

sweet
with
scent
of
heath
and
rush
;
the
sky
be
of
stainless
blue
;
the
stream
descend
the
ravine
,
swell
with
past
spring
rain
,
pour
along
plentiful
and
clear
,
catch
golden
gleam
from
the
sun

and
sapphire
tint
from
the
firmament

<EOS>
as
we
advance
and
leave
the
track

we
tread
a
soft
turf
,
mossy
fine
and
emerald
green
,
minutely
enamel
with
a
tiny
white
flower
,
and
spangle
with
a
star
-
like
yellow
blossom
:
the
hill
,
meantime
,
shut
us
quite
in
;
for
the
glen
,
towards
its
head

wound
to
their
very
core

<EOS>
"
let
us
rest
here

say
St.

as
we
reach
the
first
straggler
of
a
battalion
of
rock
,
guard
a
sort
of
pass
,
beyond
which
the
beck
rush
down
a
waterfall
;
and
where
,
still
a
little
farther
,
the
mountain
shake
off
turf
and
flower
,
have
only
heath
for
raiment
and
crag
for
gem
 
where
it
exaggerate

exchange
the
fresh
for
the
frown

guard
the
forlorn
hope

solitude

last
refuge

silence

<EOS>
I
take
a
seat
:
St.
John
stand
near
me
.
<EOS>
He
look
up
the
pass
and
down
the
hollow
;
his
glance
wander
away
with
the
stream
,
and
return
to
traverse
the
unclouded
heaven
which
colour
it
<EOS>
:
he
remove
his
hat
,
let
the
breeze
stir
his
hair
and
kiss
his
brow
.
<EOS>
He
seem
in
communion
with
the
genius
of
the
haunt
:
with
his
eye
he
bade
farewell
to
something

<EOS>
"

I
shall
see
it
again

he
say
aloud
,
"
in
dream
when
I
sleep
by

again

a
more
remote
hour
 
when
another
slumber

sit
down

I
have
an
answer

it

<EOS>
I
have
watch
you
ever
since
we
first
meet
:
I
have
make
you
my
study
for
ten
month
.
<EOS>
I
have
prove
you
in

time
by
sundry
test

what
have
I
see
and
elicit
?

I
find

could
perform
well
,
punctually
,
uprightly
,
labour
uncongenial
to
your
habit

inclination
;
I
see
you
could
perform
it
with
capacity

tact

you
could
win
while
you
control
.
<EOS>
in
the
calm
with
which
you
learn
you
have
become
suddenly
rich
,
I
read
a
mind
clear
of
the
vice
of
Demas
:
 
lucre
have
no
undue
power
over
you
.
<EOS>
in
the
resolute
readiness
with
which
you
cut
your
wealth
into
four
share
,
keep
but
one
to
yourself
,
and
relinquish
the
three
other
to
the
claim
of
abstract
justice
,
I
recognise
a
soul
that
revel
in
the
flame
and
excitement
of
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
in
the
tractability
with
which
,
at
my
wish
,
you
forsook
a
study
in
which
you
be
interested
,
and
adopt
another
because
it
interest
me
;
in
the
untiring
assiduity
with
which
you
have
since
persevere
in
it
 
in
the
unflagging
energy
and
unshaken
temper
with
which
you
have
meet
its
difficulty

quality

him

this
would
never
grieve
me

can
I
let
him
complete
his
calculation
 
coolly
put
into
practice
his
plan
 
go
through
the
wedding
ceremony
?
<EOS>
Can
I
receive
from
him
the
bridal
ring
,
endure
all
the
form
of
love
(
which
I
doubt
not
he
would
scrupulously
observe
)
and
know
that
the
spirit

quite
absent
?
<EOS>
Can
I
bear
the
consciousness
that
every
endearment
he
bestow
be
a
sacrifice
make
on
principle
?
<EOS>
no
:
such
a
martyrdom
would
be
monstrous
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
undergo
it
.
<EOS>
as
his
sister
,
I
may
accompany
him
 
not
as
his
wife

I
will
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
towards
the
knoll
:
there
he
lie
,
still
as
a
prostrate
column
;
his
face
turn
to
me
:
his
eye
beam
watchful
and
keen

He
start
to
his
foot
and
approach
me

"
I
be
ready
to
go
to
India

Your

a
commentary

his

not

I
should
take
you

as

either
our

<EOS>
I
do
consider
;

still
my
sense

such
as

direct
me
only
to
the
fact
that
we
do

to

the

you
do

You

in

how
the
work

<EOS>
simplify
your

with
effect
 
with
power
 
the
mission
of
your
great
Master

to
do
so

you
must
have
a
coadjutor

not
a

loose

a
husband

<EOS>
I
,
too

do
not

any

take
from

I

You

<EOS>
I
will
not
swear
,
reader
,
that
there
be
not
something
of
repressed
sarcasm
both
in
the
tone
in
which
I
utter
this
sentence
,
and
in
the
feeling
that
accompany
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
silently
fear
St.
John
till
now
,
because
I
have
not
understand
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
hold
me
in
awe
,
because
he
have
hold
me
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
how
much
of
him
be
saint
,
<EOS>
how
much
mortal
,
I
could
not
heretofore
tell
:
<EOS>
but
revelation
be
be
make
in
this
conference
:
the
analysis
of
his
nature
be
proceed
before
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
see
his
fallibility
:
I
comprehend
them
.
<EOS>
I
understand
that
,
sit
there
where
I
do
,
on
the
bank
of
heath
,
and
with
that
handsome
form
before
me
,
I
sit
at
the
foot
of
a
man
,
care
as
I.
the
veil
fall
from
his
hardness
and
despotism
.
<EOS>
have
feel
in
him
the
presence
of
these
quality
,
I
feel
his
imperfection
and
take
courage
.
<EOS>
I
be
with
an
equal
 
one
with
whom
I
may
argue
 
one
whom
,
if
I
see
good
,
I
may
resist
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
silent
after
I
have
utter
the
last
sentence
,
and
I
presently
risk
an
upward
glance
at
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
His
eye
,
bent
on
me
,
express
at
once
stern
surprise
and
keen
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
be
she
sarcastic
,
and
sarcastic
to
_
me
_
!
"
it
seem
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
this
signify
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
let
us
forget
that
this
be
a
solemn
matter
,
"
he
say
ere
long
;
"
one
of
which
we
may
neither
think
nor
talk
lightly
without
sin
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
Jane
,
you
be
in
earnest
when
you
say
you
will
serve
your
heart
to
God
:
it
be
all
I
want
.
<EOS>
once
wrench
your
heart
from
man
,
and
fix
it
on
your
maker
,
the
advancement
of
that
Maker
's
spiritual
kingdom
on
earth
will
be
your
chief
delight
and
endeavour
;
you
will
be
ready
to
do
at
once
whatever
further
that
end
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
what
impetus
would
be
give
to
your
effort
and
mine
by
our
physical
and
mental
union
in
marriage
:
<EOS>
the
only
union
that
give
a
character
of
permanent
conformity
to
the
destiny
and
design
of
human
being
;

,
pass
over
all
minor
caprice
 
all
trivial
difficulty
and
delicacy
of
feeling
 
all
scruple
about
the
degree

kind
,
strength

mere
personal
inclination
 
you
will
hasten

enter
into
that
union
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
briefly
;
and
I
look
at
his
feature
,
beautiful
in
their
harmony
,
but
strangely
formidable
in
their
still
severity
;
at
his
brow
,
commanding
but
not
open
;
at
his
eye
,
bright
and
deep
and
searching
,
but
never
soft
;
at
his
tall
imposing
figure
;
and
fancy
myself
in
idea
_
his
wife
_
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
would
never
do
!
<EOS>
as
his
curate
,
his
comrade
,
all
would
be
right
:
I
would
cross
ocean
with
him
in
that
capacity
;
toil
under
eastern
sun
,
in
asian
desert
with
him
in
that
office
;
admire
and
emulate
his
courage
and
devotion
and
vigour
;
accommodate
quietly
to
his
masterhood
;
smile
undisturbed
at
his
ineradicable
ambition
;
discriminate
the
Christian
from
the
man
:
profoundly
esteem
the
one
,
and
freely
forgive
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
should
suffer
often
,
no
doubt
,
attach
to
him
only
in
this
capacity
:
my
body
would
be
under
rather
a
stringent
yoke
,
but
my
heart
and
mind
would
be
free
.
<EOS>
I
should
still
have
my
unblighted
self
to
turn
to
:
my
natural
unenslaved
feeling
with
which
to
communicate
in
moment
of
loneliness
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
recess
in
my
mind
which
would
be
only
mine
,
to
which
he
never
come
,
and
sentiment
grow
there
fresh
and
shelter
which
his
austerity
could
never
blight
,
nor
his
measure
warrior
-
march
trample
down
:
but
as
his
wife
 
at
his
side
always
,
and
always
restrained
,
and
always
check
 
force
to
keep
the
fire
of
my
nature
continually
low
,
to
compel
it
to
burn
inwardly
and
never
utter
a
cry
,
though
the
imprison
flame
consume
vital
after
vital
 
_
<EOS>
this
_
would
be
unendurable

I
exclaim
,
when
I
have
get
so
far
in

meditation

icily

I
repeat

freely
consent

with
you

steadily

thirty

take
out
with

can
we
be

ever

sometimes
in
solitude

sometimes
amidst

tribe

unwed

<EOS>

shortly

circumstance

It
be

that

not

you

to
attempt

would
be
to
fasten
injurious
suspicion
on

for
the

do

affirm

disdain

perfectly
well

have
a

heart

not
where
you
be
concerned

I
have
only
a
comrade

constancy

a
fellow

soldier

frankness

fidelity

fraternity

if
you
like

I
want

there
be
obstacle
in
the
way

must
be
hew
down

not
repent

certain
of
that

we

be
married

I
repeat
it
:
there
be
no
other
way

undoubtedly
enough
of
love
would
follow
upon
marriage
to
render
the
union
right
even
in
your
eye

"
  
<EOS>

I
scorn
your
idea

could
not

rise
up

stand
before
him

lean
my
back
against

rock

I
scorn
the
counterfeit
sentiment
you
offer

scorn

it

look
at

fixedly

compress
his
well

cut
lip
while
he
do
so

<EOS>
whether
he
be
incense

surprised

what
,
it
be
not

tell

his
countenance
thoroughly

from

once
more

well

resistance
where
it
expect
submission
 
<EOS>
the
disapprobation
of
a
cool
,
inflexible
judgment
,
which
have
detect
in
another
feeling
and
view
in
which
it
have
no
power
to
sympathise
:
in
short
,
as
a
man
,
he
would
have
wish
to
coerce
me
into
obedience
:
it
be
only
as
a
sincere
Christian
he
bear
so
patiently
with
my
perversity
,
and
allow
so
long
a
space
for
reflection
and
repentance
.
  
<EOS>
that
night
,
after
he
have
kiss
his
sister
,
he
think
proper
to
forget
even
to
shake
hand
with
me
,
but
leave
the
room
in
silence
.
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
who
,
though
I
have
no
love
,
have
much
friendship
for
him
 
be
hurt
by
the
marked
omission
:
so
much
hurt
that
tear
start
to
my
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
and
St.
John
have
be
quarrel
,
Jane
,
"
say
Diana
,
"
during
your
walk
on
the
moor
.
<EOS>
but
go
after
him
;
he
be
now
linger
in
the
passage
expect
you
 
he
will
make
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
much
pride
under
such
circumstance
:
I
would
always
rather
be
happy
than
dignified
;
and
I
run
after
him
 
he
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
night
,
St.
John
,
"
say
I.
  
"
good
-
night
,
Jane
,
"
he
reply
calmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
shake
hand
,
"
I
add
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
cold
,
loose
touch
,
he
impress
on
my
finger
!
<EOS>
He
be
deeply
displeased
by
what
have
occur
that
day
;
cordiality
would
not
warm
,
nor
tear
move
him
.
<EOS>
no
happy
reconciliation
be
to
be
have
with
him
 
no
cheer
smile
or
generous
word
:
but
still
the
Christian
be
patient
and
placid
;
and
when
I
ask
him
if
he
forgive
me
,
he
answer
that
he
be
not
in
the
habit
of
cherish
the
remembrance
of
vexation
;
that
he
have
nothing
to
forgive
,
not
have
be
offend
.
  
<EOS>
and
with
that
answer
he
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
he
have
knock
me
down
.
    
<EOS>
He
do
not
leave
for
Cambridge
the
next
day
,
as
he
have
say
he
would
.
<EOS>
He
defer
his
departure
a
whole
week
,
and
during
that
time
he
make
me
feel
what
severe
punishment
a
good
yet
stern
,
<EOS>
a
conscientious
yet
implacable
man
can
inflict
on
one
who
have
offend
him
.
<EOS>
without
one
overt
act
of
hostility
,
one
upbraid
word
,
he
contrive
to
impress
me
momently
with
the
conviction
that
I
be
put
beyond
the
pale
of
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
St.
John
harbour
a
spirit
of
unchristian
vindictiveness
 
not
that
he
would
have
injure
a
hair
of
my
head
,
if
it
have
be
fully
in
his
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
both
by
nature
and
principle
,
he
be
superior
to
the
mean
gratification
of
vengeance
:
he
have
forgive
me
for
say
I
scorn
him
and
his
love
,
but
he
have
not
forget
the
word
;
and
as
long
as
he
and
I
live
he
never
would
forget
them
.
<EOS>
I
see
by
his
look
,
when
he
turn
to
me
,
that
they
be
always
write
on
the
air
between
me
and
him
;
whenever
I
speak
,
they
sound
in
my
voice
to
his
ear
,
and
their
echo
tone
every
answer
he
give
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
abstain
from
converse
with
me
:
he
even
call
me
as
usual
each
morning
to
join
him
at
his
desk
;
and
I
fear
the
corrupt
man
within
him
have
a
pleasure
unimparted
to
,
and
unshared
by
,
the
pure
Christian
,
in
evince
with
what
skill
he
could
,
while
act
and
speak
apparently
just
as
usual
,
extract
from
every
deed
and
every
phrase
the
spirit
of
interest
and
approval
which
have
formerly
communicate
a
certain
austere
charm
to
his
language
and
manner
.
<EOS>
to
me
,
he
be
in
reality
become
no
long
flesh
,
but
marble
;
his
eye
be
a
cold
,
bright
,
blue
gem
;
his
tongue
a
speak
instrument
 
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
torture
to
me
 
refined
,
linger
torture
.
<EOS>
It
keep
up
a
slow
fire
of
indignation
and
a
tremble
trouble
of
grief
,
which
harass
and
crush
me
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
feel
how
 
if
I
be
his
wife
,
this
good
man
,
pure
as
the
deep
sunless
source
,
could
soon
kill
me
,
without
draw
from
my
vein
a
single
drop
of
blood
,
or
receive
on
his
own
crystal
conscience
the
faint
stain
of
crime
.
<EOS>
especially
I
feel
this
when
I
make
any
attempt
to
propitiate
him
.
<EOS>
no
ruth
meet
my
ruth
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
experience
no
suffering
from
estrangement
 
<EOS>
no
yearning
after
reconciliation
;
and
though
,
more
than
once
,
my
fast
fall
tear
blister
the
page
over
which
we
both
bent
,
they
produce
no
more
effect
on
him
than
if
his
heart
have
be
really
a
matter
of
stone
or
metal
.
<EOS>
to
his
sister
,
meantime
,
he
be
somewhat
kind
than
usual
:
as
if
afraid
that
mere
coldness
would
not
sufficiently
convince
me
how
completely
I
be
banish
and
ban
,
he
add
the
force
of
contrast
;
and
this
I
be
sure
he
do
not
by
force
,
but
on
principle
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
before
he
leave
home
,
happen
to
see
him
walk
in
the
garden
about
sunset
,
and
remember
,
as
I
look
at
him
,
that
this
man
,
alienate
as
he
now
be
,
have
once
save
my
life
,
and
that
we
be
near
relation
,
I
be
move
to
make
a
last
attempt
to
regain
his
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
go
out
and
approach
him
as
he
stand
lean
over
the
little
gate
;
I
speak
to
the
point
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
St.
John
,
I
be
unhappy
because
you
be
still
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
let
us
be
friend

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
be
friend
,
"
be
the
unmoved
reply
;
while
he
still
watch
the
rising
of
the
moon
,
which
he
have
be
contemplate
as
I
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
St.
John
;
for
I
be
sure
you
be
incapable
of
wish
any
one
ill
;
but
,
as
I
be
your
kinswoman
,
I
should
desire
somewhat
more
of
affection
than
that
sort
of
general
philanthropy
you
extend
to
mere
stranger

<EOS>

of
course

he
say
.
<EOS>
"
Your
wish
be
reasonable
,

I
be
far
from
regard
you
as
a
stranger

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
,
speak
in
a
cool
,
tranquil
tone
,
be
mortify
and
baffle
enough
.
<EOS>
have
I
attend
to
the
suggestion
of
pride
and
ire
,
I
should
immediately
have
leave
him
;
but
something
work
within
me
more
strongly
than
those
feeling
could
.
<EOS>
I
deeply
venerate
my
cousin
's
talent
and
principle
.
<EOS>
His
friendship
be
of
value
to
me
:
to
lose
it
try
me
severely
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
so
soon
relinquish
the
attempt
to
reconquer
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
we
part
in
this
way

St.
John

you
leave
me
so

He
now
turn
quite
from

he
ask

severe

inexcusable

I
have
finish
the
business
now

earnestly
wish
to
erase
from

the

another

what
struggle
there
be
in
him
between
Nature

interval

I
can
not
tell
:
only
singular
gleam
scintillate
in
his
eye

strange
shadow
pass
over
his

speak
at
last

you
the

mine

I
prove

prevent

keep
to

shock

I

You
be
not

shock

with

superior

you
can
not

either
so
dull

so
conceited

misunderstand
my

again

<EOS>
again
he
turn
lividly
pale
;

,
as
before
,
control
his
passion
perfectly

<EOS>
He
answer
emphatically

calmly
    
"
a
female
curate

never

thus
you

spare
the
dishonour

break
your

join

now
I
never

the

know

either
give
any
formal

enter
into
any
engagement

this
language
be
all
much
too
hard

much
too
despotic
for
the
occasion

I
reply
    
"
there
be
no
dishonour

no
breach
of
promise

no
desertion

would
have
venture
much

I
admire

confide

I
be
convince

I
begin

be
almost
equivalent

commit
suicide

I
will

<EOS>
He
open
the
gate

pass
through
it
,
and
stray
away
down
the
glen
.
<EOS>
He
be
soon
out
of
sight

<EOS>
on
re
-
enter
the
parlour
,
I
find
Diana
stand
at
the
window
,
look
very
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
Diana
be
a
great
deal
tall
than
I
:
she
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
,
stoop
,
examine
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
be
always
agitated
and
pale
now

<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
something
the
matter

<EOS>
tell
me
what
business
St.
John
and
you
have
on
hand

<EOS>
I
have
watch
you
this
half
hour
from
the
window
;
you
must
forgive
my
be
such
a
spy
,
but
for
a
long
time
I
have
fancy
I
hardly
know
what

<EOS>
St.
John
be
a
strange
being
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
speak
:
soon
she
resume
    
"
that
brother
of
mine

peculiar
view

some
sort

you

I
be
sure
:
he
have
long
distinguish
you
by
a
notice
and
interest
he
never
show
to
any
one
else
 
to
what
end

<EOS>
I
wish
he
love
you
 
<EOS>
do
he
,
Jane

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
her
cool
hand
to
my
hot
forehead
;
"
no
,
die
,
not
one
whit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
do
he
follow
you
so
with
his
eye
,
and
get
you
so
frequently
alone
with
him
,
and
keep
you
so
continually
at

Mary

I
have
both
conclude
he
wish
you
to
marry
him

He
do

he

ask

to
be
his

<EOS>
Diana
clap
her
hand
.

"
that
be
just
what
we
hope

you
will
marry

not
you

<EOS>
and
then
he
will
stay
in
England

<EOS>
"
  
"
far
from
that
,
Diana
;
his
sole
idea
in
propose
to
me
be
to
procure
a
fitting
fellow
-
labourer
in
his
indian
toil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
He
wish
you
to
go
to
India
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
"
Madness
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
live
three
month
there
,
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
You
never
shall
go
:
you
have
not
consent

have
you
,
Jane

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
refuse
to
marry
him
 
"
  
"
and
have
consequently
displease
him

"
she
suggest
.
  
<EOS>
"
deeply
:
he
will
never
forgive
me
,
I
fear
:
<EOS>
yet
I
offer
to
accompany
him
as
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
frantic
folly
to
do
so
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
think
of
the
task
you
undertake
 
one
of
incessant
fatigue
,
where
fatigue
kill
even
the
strong
,
and
you
be
weak
.
<EOS>
St.
John
 
you
know
him
 
would
urge
you
to
impossibility
:
with
him
there
would
be
no
permission
to
rest
during
the
hot
hour
;
and
unfortunately
,
I
have
notice
,
whatever
he
exact
,
you
force
yourself
to
perform
.
<EOS>
I
be
astonish
<EOS>
you
find
courage
to
refuse
his
hand
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
love
him
then
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
as
a
husband

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
he
be
a
handsome
fellow

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
so
plain
,
you
see
,
die
.
<EOS>
We
should
never
suit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
plain
!
<EOS>
You
?
<EOS>
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
be
much
too
pretty
,
as
well
as
too
good
,
to
be
grill
alive
in
Calcutta
.
"
<EOS>
and
again
she
earnestly
conjure
me
to
give
up
all
thought
of
go
out
with
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
indeed
,
"
I
say
;
"
for
when
just
now
I
repeat
the
offer
of
serve
him
for
a
deacon
,
he
express
himself
shock
at
my
want
of
decency
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
think
I
have
commit
an
impropriety
in
propose
to
accompany
him
unmarried
:
as
if
I
have
not
from
the
first
hope
to
find
in
him
a
brother
,
and
habitually
regard
him
as
such
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
say
he
do
not
love
you
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
hear
himself
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
again
and
again
explain
that
it
be
not
himself
,
but
his
office
he
wish
to
mate
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
I
be
form
for
labour
 
not
for
love
:
which
be
true
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
I
be
not
form
for
love
,
it
follow
that
I
be
not
form
for
marriage
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
strange
,
die
,
to
be
chain
for
life
to
a
man
who
regard
one
but
as
a
useful
tool
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
insupportable
 
unnatural
 
out
of
the
question
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
,
"
I
continue
,
"
though
I
have
only
sisterly
affection
for
him
now
,
yet
,
if
force
to
be
his
wife
,
I
can
imagine
the
possibility
of
conceive
an
inevitable
,
strange
,
torture
kind
of
love
for
him
,
because
he
be
so
talented
;
and
there
be
often
a
certain
heroic
grandeur
in
his
look
,
manner
,
and
conversation
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
my
lot
would
become
unspeakably
wretched
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
want
me
to
love
him
;
and
if
I
show
the
feeling
,
he
would
make
me
sensible
that
it
be
a
superfluity
,
unrequired
by
him
,
unbecome
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
yet
St.
John
be
a
good
man
,
"
say
Diana
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
good
and
a
great
man
;
but
he
forget
,
pitilessly
,
the
feeling
and
claim
of
little
people
,
in
pursue
his
own
large
view
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
,
therefore
,
for
the
insignificant
to
keep
out
of
his
way
,
l
,
in
his
progress
,
he
should
trample
them
down
.
<EOS>
here
he
come
!
<EOS>
I
will
leave
you
,
Diana
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
hasten
upstairs
as
I
see
him
enter
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
force
to
meet
him
again
at
supper
.
<EOS>
during
that
meal
he
appear
just
as
compose
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
he
would
hardly
speak
to
me
,
and
I
be
certain
he
have
give
up
the
pursuit
of
his
matrimonial
scheme
<EOS>
:
the
sequel
show
I
be
mistake
on
both
point
.
<EOS>
He
address
me
precisely
in
his
ordinary
manner
,
or
what
have
,
of
late
,
be
his
ordinary
manner
 
one
scrupulously
polite
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
have
invoke
the
help
of
the
Holy
Spirit
to
subdue
the
anger
I
have
rouse
in
him
,
and
now
believe
he
have
forgive
me
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
evening
read
before
prayer
,
he
select
the
twenty
-
first
chapter
of
Revelation
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
all
time
pleasant
to
listen
while
from
his
lip
fall
the
word
of
the
Bible
:
never
do
his
fine
voice
sound
at
once
so
sweet
and
full
 
never
do
his
manner
become
so
impressive
in
its
noble
simplicity
,
as
when
he
deliver
the
oracle
of
God
:
and
to
-
night
that
voice
take
a
more
solemn
tone
 
that
manner
a
more
thrilling
meaning
 
as
he
sit
in
the
midst
of
his
household
circle
(
the
May
moon
shine
in
through
the
uncurtained
window
,
and
render
almost
unnecessary
the
light
of
the
candle
on
the
table
)
:
as
he
sit
there
,
bend
over
the
great
old
Bible
,
and
describe
from
its
page
the
vision
of
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
 
tell
how
God
would
come
to
dwell
with
man
,
how
He
would
wipe
away
all
tear
from
their
eye
,
and
promise
that
there
should
be
no
more
death
,
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
,
nor
any
more
pain
,
because
the
former
thing
be
pass
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
succeed
word
thrill
me
strangely
as
he
speak
them
:
especially
as
I
feel
,
by
the
slight
,
indescribable
alteration
in
sound
,
that
in
utter
them
,
his
eye
have
turn
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
that
overcometh
shall
inherit
all
thing
;
and
I
will
be
his
God
,
and
he
shall
be
my
son
.
<EOS>
but
,
"
be
slowly
,
distinctly
read
,
"
the
fearful
,
the
unbelieving
,
&
c.
,
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
,
which
be
the
second
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
Henceforward
,
I
know
what
fate
<EOS>
St.
John
fear
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
a
calm
,
subdued
triumph
,
blent
with
a
long
earnestness
,
mark
his
enunciation
of
the
last
glorious
verse
of
that
chapter
.
<EOS>
the
reader
believe
his
name
be
already
write
in
the
Lamb
's
book
of
life
,
and
he
yearn
after
the
hour
which
should
admit
him
to
the
city
to
which
the
king
of
the
earth
bring
their
glory
and
honour
;
which
have
no
need
of
sun
or
moon
to
shine
in
it
,
because
the
glory
of
God
lighten
it
,
and
the
Lamb
be
the
light
thereof
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
prayer
follow
the
chapter
,
all
his
energy
gather
 
all
his
stern
zeal
wake
:
he
be
in
deep
earnest
,
wrestle
with
God
,
and
resolve
on
a
conquest
.
<EOS>
He
supplicate
strength
for
the
weak
-
hearted
;
guidance
for
wanderer
from
the
fold
:
a
return
,
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
for
those
whom
the
temptation
of
the
world
and
the
flesh
be
lure
from
the
narrow
path
.
<EOS>
He
ask
,
he
urge
,
he
claim
the
boon
of
a
brand
snatch
from
the
burning
.
<EOS>
earnestness
be
ever
deeply
solemn
:
first
,
as
I
listen
to
that
prayer
,
I
wonder
at
his
;
then
,
when
it
continue
and
rise
,
I
be
touch
by
it
,
and
at
last
awed
.
<EOS>
He
feel
the
greatness
and
goodness
of
his
purpose
so
sincerely
:
other
who
hear
him
plead
for
it
,
could
not
but
feel
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
the
prayer
over
<EOS>
,
we
take
leave
of
him
:
he
be
to
go
at
a
very
early
hour
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
have
kiss
him
,
leave
the
room
 
in
compliance
,
I
think
,
with
a
whisper
hint
from
him
:
I
tender
my
hand
,
and
wish
him
a
pleasant
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
as
I
say
,
I
shall
return
from
Cambridge
in
a
fortnight
:
that
space
,
then
,
be
yet
leave
you
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
if
I
listen
to
human
pride
,
I
should
say
no
more
to
you
of
marriage
with
me
;
but
I
listen
to
my
duty
,
and
keep
steadily
in
view
my
first
aim
 
to
do
all
thing
to
the
glory
of
God
.
<EOS>
My
Master
be
long
-
suffer
:
so
will
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
you
up
to
perdition
as
a
vessel
of
wrath
:
<EOS>
repent
 
resolve
,
while
there
be
yet
time
.
<EOS>
remember
,
we
be
bid
to
work
while
it
be
day
 
<EOS>
warn
that
"
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
shall
work
.
"
<EOS>
remember
the
fate
of
Dives
,
who
have
his
good
thing
in
this
life
.
<EOS>
God
give
you
strength
to
choose
that
well
part
which
shall
not
be
take
from
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
lay
his
hand
on
my
head
as
he
utter
the
last
word
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
earnestly
,
mildly
:
his
look
be
not
,
indeed
,
that
of
a
lover
behold
his
mistress
,
but
it
be
that
of
a
pastor
recall
his
wander
sheep
 
or
well
,
of
a
guardian
angel
watch
the
soul
for
which
he
be
responsible
.
<EOS>
all
man
of
talent
,
whether
they
be
man
of
feeling
or
not
;
whether
they
be
zealot
,
or
aspirant
,
or
despot
 
<EOS>
provide
only
they
be
sincere
 
<EOS>
have
their
sublime
moment
,
when
they
subdue
and
rule
.
<EOS>
I
feel
veneration
for
St.
John
 
veneration
so
strong
that
its
impetus
thrust
me
at
once
to
the
point
I
have
so
long
shun
.
<EOS>
I
be
tempt
to
cease
struggle
with
him
 
to
rush
down
the
torrent
of
his
will
into
the
gulf
of
his
existence
,
and
there
lose
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
be
almost
as
hard
beset
by
him
now
as
I
have
be
once
before
,
in
a
different
way
,
by
another
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
fool
both
time
.
<EOS>
to
have
yield
then
would
have
be
an
error
of
principle
;
to
have
yield
now
would
have
be
an
error
of
judgment
.
<EOS>
so
I
think
at
this
hour
,
when
I
look
back
to
the
crisis
through
the
quiet
medium
of
time
:
I
be
unconscious
of
folly
at
the
instant
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
motionless
under
my
hierophant
's
touch
.
<EOS>
My
refusal
be
forget
 
<EOS>
my
fear
overcome
 
my
wrestling
paralyse
.
<EOS>
the
Impossible
 
_
<EOS>
i.e.
_
,
my
marriage
with
St.
John
 
be
fast
become
the
Possible

<EOS>
all
be
change
utterly
with
a
sudden
sweep
.
<EOS>
religion
call
 
Angels
beckon
 
God

life
roll
together
like
a

death

gate
opening

it
seem

that
for
safety
and
bliss
there
,
all
here
may
be
sacrifice
in
a
second
.
<EOS>
the
dim
room
be
full
of
vision
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
decide
now
?
"
ask
the
missionary
.
<EOS>
the
inquiry
be
put
in
gentle
tone
:
he
draw
me
to
him
as
gently
.
<EOS>
oh
,
that
gentleness
!
<EOS>
how
far
more
potent
be
it
than
force
!
<EOS>
I
could
resist
St.
John
's
wrath
:
I
grow
pliant
as
a
reed
under
his
kindness
.
<EOS>
yet
I
know
all
the
time
,
if
I
yield
now
,
I
should
not
the
less
be
make
to
repent
,
some
day
,
of
my
former
rebellion
.
<EOS>
His
nature
be
not
change
by
one
hour
of
solemn
prayer
:
it
be
only
elevate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
decide
if
I
be
but
certain
,
"
I
answer
:
"
be
I
but
convince
that
it
be
God
's
will
<EOS>
I
should
marry
you
,
I
could
vow
to
marry
you
here
<EOS>
and
now
 
come
afterwards
<EOS>
what
would
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
prayer
be
hear
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
St.
John
.
<EOS>
He
press
his
hand
firmer
on
my
head
,
as
if
he
claim
me
:
he
surround
me
with
his
arm
,
_
<EOS>
almost
_
<EOS>
as
if
he
love
me
<EOS>
(
I
say
_
<EOS>
almost
_
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
difference
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
feel
what
it
be
to
be
love
;
but
,
like
him
,
I
have
now
put
love
out
of
the
question
,
and
think
only
of
duty
)
.
<EOS>
I
contend
with
my
inward
dimness
of
vision
,
before
which
cloud
yet
roll
.
<EOS>
I
sincerely
,
deeply
,
fervently
long
to
do
what
be
right
;
and
only
that
.
"
<EOS>
show
me
,
show
me
the
path
!
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
I
be
excite
more
than
I
have
ever
be
;
and
whether
what
follow
be
the
effect
of
excitement
the
reader
shall
judge
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
house
be
still
;
for
I
believe
all
,
except
St.
John
and
myself
,
be
now
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
the
one
candle
be
die
out
:
the
room
be
full
of
moonlight
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
fast
and
thick
:
I
hear
its
throb
.
<EOS>
suddenly
it
stand
still
to
an
inexpressible
feeling
that
thrill
it
through
,
and
pass
at
once
to
my
head
and
extremity
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
be
not
like
an
electric
shock
,
but
it
be
quite
as
sharp
,
as
strange
,
as
startling
<EOS>
:
it
act
on
my
sense
as
if
their
utmost
activity
hitherto
have
be
but
torpor
,
from
which
they
be
now
summon
and
force
to
wake
.
<EOS>
They
rise
expectant
:
eye
and
ear
wait
while
the
flesh
quiver
on
my
bone
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
hear
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
see
?
"
ask
St.
John
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
,
but
I
hear
a
voice
somewhere
cry
    
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
"
 
<EOS>
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
God
!
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
say
,
"
where
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
for
it
do
not
seem
in
the
room
 
nor
in
the
house
 
nor
in
the
garden
;
it
do
not
come
out
of
the
air
 
nor
from
under
the
earth
 
nor
from
overhead
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
it
 
where
,
or
whence
,
for
ever
impossible
to
know
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
the
voice
of
a
human
being
 
a
know
,
love
,
well
-
remember
voice
 
that
of
Edward
Fairfax
Rochester
;
and
it
speak
in
pain
and
woe
,
wildly
,
eerily
,
urgently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
wait
for
me
!
<EOS>
oh
,
I
will
come
!
<EOS>
"
I
fly
to
the
door
and
look
into
the
passage
:
it
be
dark
.
<EOS>
I
run
out
into
the
garden
:
it
be
void
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
  
<EOS>
the
hill
beyond
Marsh
Glen
send
the
answer
faintly
back
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
listen
.
<EOS>
the
wind
sigh
low
in
the
fir
:
all
be
moorland
loneliness
and
midnight
hush
.
  
<EOS>
"
down
superstition
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
comment
,
as
that
spectre
rise
up
black
by
the
black
yew
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
not
thy
deception
,
nor
thy
witchcraft
:
it
be
the
work
of
nature
.
<EOS>
She
be
rouse
,
and
do
 
no
miracle
 
but
her
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
break
from
St.
John
,
who
have
follow
,
and
would
have
detain
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
_
<EOS>
my
_
time
to
assume
ascendency
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
My
_
power
be
in
play
and
in
force
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
to
forbear
question
or
remark
;
I
desire
him
to
leave
me
:
I
must
and
would
be
alone
.
<EOS>
He
obey
at
once
.
<EOS>
where
there
be
energy
to
command
well
enough
,
obedience
never
fail
.
<EOS>
I
mount
to
my
chamber
;
lock
myself
in
;
fall
on
my
knee
;
and
pray
in
my
way
 
a
different
way
to
St.
John
's
,
but
effective
in
its
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
penetrate
very
near
a
Mighty
Spirit
;
and
my
soul
rush
out
in
gratitude
at
His
foot
.
<EOS>
I
rise
from
the
thanksgiving
 
<EOS>
take
a
resolve
 
and
lie
down
,
unscared
,
enlighten
 
<EOS>
eager
but
for
the
daylight
.
    
<EOS>
the
daylight
come
.
<EOS>
I
rise
at
dawn
.
<EOS>
I
busy
myself
for
an
hour
or
two
with
arrange
my
thing
in
my
chamber
,
drawer
,
and
wardrobe
,
in
the
order
wherein
I
should
wish
to
leave
them
during
a
brief
absence
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
I
hear
St.
John
quit
his
room
.
<EOS>
He
stop
at
my
door
:
I
fear
he
would
knock
 
<EOS>
no
,
but
a
slip
of
paper
be
pass
under
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
It
bear
these
word
    
<EOS>
"
You
leave
me
too
suddenly
last
night

<EOS>
have
you
stay
but
a
little
longer
,
you
would
have
lay
your
hand
on
the
Christian

cross

the
angel

crown

<EOS>
I
shall
expect
your
clear
decision
when
I
return
this
day
fortnight
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
watch
and
pray
that
you
enter
not
into
temptation
:
the
spirit
,
I
trust
,
be
willing
,
but
the
flesh

I
see
,
be
weak

<EOS>
I
shall
pray
for
you
hourly

Yours

<EOS>
"
My

I
answer
mentally
,
"
be
willing
to
do
what
be
right

and
my
flesh

,
I
hope
,
be
strong

accomplish
the

Heaven

when
once
that

be
distinctly
known

me

<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
it
shall
be
strong
enough
to
search
 
inquire
 
to
grope
an
outlet
from
this
cloud

doubt

and
find
the
open
day

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
of
June
;
yet
the
morning
be
overcast
and
chilly
<EOS>
:
rain
beat
fast
on
my
casement
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
front
-
door
open
,
and
St.
John
pass
out
.
<EOS>
look
through
the
window
,
I
see
him
traverse
the
garden
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
way
over
the
misty
moor
in
the
direction
of
Whitcross
 
there
he
would
meet
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
a
few
more
hour
I
shall
succeed
you
in
that
track
,
cousin
,
"
think
I
:
"
I
too
have
a
coach
to
meet
at
Whitcross
.
<EOS>
I
too
have
some
to
see
and
ask
after
in
England
,
before
I
depart
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
want
yet
two
hour
of
breakfast
-
time
.
<EOS>
I
fill
the
interval
in
walk
softly
about
my
room
,
and
ponder
the
visitation
which
have
give
my
plan
their
present
bent
.
<EOS>
I
recall
that
inward
sensation
I
have
experience
:
for
I
could
recall
it
,
with
all
its
unspeakable
strangeness
.
<EOS>
I
recall
the
voice
I
have
hear
;
again
I
question
whence
<EOS>
it
come
,
as
vainly
as
before
:
it
seem
in
_
me
_
 
not
in
the
external
world
.
<EOS>
I
ask
be
it
a
mere
nervous
impression
 
<EOS>
a
delusion
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
conceive
or
believe
:
it
be
more
like
an
inspiration
.
<EOS>
the
wondrous
shock
of
feeling
have
come
like
the
earthquake
which
shake
the
foundation
of
Paul
and
Silas
's
prison
;
it
have
open
the
door
of
the
soul
's
cell
and
loose
its
band
 
<EOS>
it
have
waken
it
out
of
its
sleep
,
whence
it
spring
<EOS>
tremble
,
listening
,
aghast
<EOS>
;
then
vibrate
thrice
a
cry
on
my
startled
ear
,
and
in
my
quake
heart
and
through
my
spirit
,
which
neither
fear
nor
shake
,
but
exult
as
if
in
joy
over
the
success
of
one
effort
it
have
be
privilege
to
make
,
independent
of
the
cumbrous
body
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ere
many
day
,
"
I
say
,
as
I
terminate
my
musing
,
"
I
will
know
something
of
him
whose
voice
seem
last
night
to
summon
me
.
<EOS>
letter
have
prove
of
no
avail
 
personal
inquiry
shall
replace
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
breakfast
I
announce
to
Diana
and
Mary
that
I
be
go
a
journey
,
and
should
be
absent
at
least
four
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
alone
,
Jane
?
"
they
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
be
to
see
or
hear
news
of
a
friend
about
whom
I
have
<EOS>
for
some
time
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
may
have
say
,
as
I
have
no
doubt
they
think
,
that
they
have
believe
me
to
be
without
any
friend
save
them
:
for
,
indeed
,
I
have
often
say
so
;
but
,
with
their
true
natural
delicacy
,
they
abstain
from
comment
,
except
that
Diana
ask
me
if
I
be
sure
I
be
well
enough
to
travel
.
<EOS>
I
look
very
pale
,
she
observe
.
<EOS>
I
reply
,
that
nothing
ail
me
save
anxiety
of
mind
,
<EOS>
which
I
hope
soon
to
alleviate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
make
my
further
arrangement
;
for
I
be
troubled
with
no
inquiry
 
no
surmise
.
<EOS>
have
once
explain
to
them
that
I
could
not
now
be
explicit
about
my
plan
,
they
kindly
and
wisely
acquiesce
in
the
silence
with
which
I
pursue
them
,
accord
to
me
the
privilege
of
free
action
I
should
under
similar
circumstance
have
accord
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
Moor
House
at
three
o'clock
p.m.
,
and
soon
after
four
I
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
sign
-
post
of
Whitcross
,
wait
the
arrival
of
the
coach
which
be
to
take
me
to
distant
Thornfield
.
<EOS>
amidst
the
silence
of
those
solitary
road
and
desert
hill
,
I
hear
it
approach
from
a
great
distance
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
vehicle
whence
,
a
year
ago
,
I
have
alight
one
summer
evening
on
this
very
spot
 
<EOS>
how
desolate
,
and
hopeless
,
and
objectless
!
<EOS>
It
stop
as
I
beckon
.
<EOS>
I
enter
 
not
now
oblige
to
part
with
my
whole
fortune
as
the
price
of
its
accommodation
.
<EOS>
once
more
on
the
road
to
Thornfield
,
I
feel
like
the
messenger
-
pigeon
fly
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
journey
of
six
-
and
-
thirty
hour
.
<EOS>
I
have
set
out
from
Whitcross
on
a
Tuesday
afternoon
,
and
early
on
the
succeed
Thursday
morning
the
coach
stop
to
water
the
horse
at
a
wayside
inn
,
situate
in
the
midst
of
scenery
whose
green
hedge
and
large
field
and
low
pastoral
hill
(
how
mild
of
feature
and
verdant
of
hue
compare
with
the
stern
North-
Midland
moor
of
Morton
!
)
<EOS>
meet
my
eye
like
the
lineament
of
a
once
familiar
face
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
know
the
character
of
this
landscape
:
<EOS>
I
be
sure
we
be
near
my
bourne
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
far
be
Thornfield
Hall
from
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
of
the
ostler
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
two
mile
,
madam
,
across
the
field
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
journey
be
closed
,
"
I
think
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
get
out
of
the
coach
,
give
a
box
I
have
into
the
ostler
's
charge
,
to
be
keep
till
I
call
for
it
;
pay
my
fare
;
satisfy
the
coachman
,
and
be
go
:
<EOS>
the
brightening
day
gleam
on
the
sign
of
the
inn
,
and
I
read
in
gilt
letter
,
"
the
Rochester
Arms
.
<EOS>
"
My
heart
leapt
up
:
I
be
already
on
my
master
's
very
land
.
<EOS>
It
fall
again
:
<EOS>
the
thought
strike
it
:
    
<EOS>
"
Your
master
himself
may
be
beyond
the
British
Channel
,
for
aught
you
know
:
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
he
be
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
towards
which
you
hasten
,
who
besides
him
be
there
?
<EOS>
His
lunatic
wife
:
<EOS>
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
<EOS>
:
you
dare
not
speak
to
him
or
seek
his
presence
.
<EOS>
You
have
lose
your
labour
 
<EOS>
you
have
better
go
no
farther
,
"
urge
the
monitor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ask
information
of
the
people
at
the
inn
;
they
can
give
you
all
you
seek
:
they
can
solve
your
doubt
at
once
.
<EOS>
go
up
to
that
man
,
and
inquire
if
Mr.
Rochester
be
at
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
suggestion
be
sensible
,
and
yet
I
could
not
force
myself
to
act
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
so
dread
a
reply
that
would
crush
me
with
despair
.
<EOS>
to
prolong
doubt
be
to
prolong
hope
.
<EOS>
I
may
yet
once
more
see
the
Hall
under
the
ray
of
her
star
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
stile
before
me
 
the
very
field
through
which
I
have
hurry
,
blind
,
deaf
,
distract
with
a
revengeful
fury
tracking
and
scourge
me
,
on
the
morning
I
flee
from
Thornfield
:
ere
<EOS>
I
well
know
what
course
I
have
resolve
to
take
<EOS>
,
I
be
in
the
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
how
fast
I
walk
!
<EOS>
how
I
run
sometimes
!
<EOS>
how
I
look
forward
to
catch
the
first
view
of
the
well
-
know
wood
!
<EOS>
with
what
feeling
I
welcome
single
tree
I
know
,
and
familiar
glimpse
of
meadow
and
hill
between
them
!
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
wood
rise
;
the
rookery
cluster
dark
;
a
loud
cawing
break
the
morning
stillness
.
<EOS>
strange
delight

on

<EOS>
another
field
cross
 
a
lane
thread
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
courtyard
wall
 
<EOS>
the
back
office
:
<EOS>
the
house
itself
,
the
rookery
still
hide
.
<EOS>
"
My
first
view
of
it
shall
be
in
front
,
"
I
determine
,
"
where
its
bold
battlement
will
strike
the
eye
nobly
at
once
,
and
where
I
can
single
out
my
master
's
very
window
:
perhaps
he
will
be
stand
at
it
 
<EOS>
he
rise
early
:
perhaps
he
be
now
walk
in
the
orchard
,
or
on
the
pavement
in
front
.
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
I
but
see
him
!
 
<EOS>
but
a
moment
!
<EOS>
surely
,
in
that
case
,
I
should
not
be
so
mad
as
to
run
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
 
I
be
not
certain
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
do
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
who
would
be
hurt
by
my
once
more
taste
the
life
his
glance
can
give
me
?
<EOS>
I
rave
:
perhaps
at
this
moment
he
be
watch
the
sun
rise
over
the
Pyrenees
,
or
on
the
tideless
sea
of
the
south
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
coast
along
the
low
wall
of
the
orchard
 
turn
its
angle
:
there
be
a
gate
just
there
,
open
into
the
meadow
,
between
two
stone
pillar
crown
by
stone
ball
.
<EOS>
from
behind
one
pillar
I
could
peep
round
quietly
at
the
full
front
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
I
advance
my
head
with
precaution
,
desirous
to
ascertain
if
any
bedroom
window
-
blind
be
yet
draw
up
:
battlement
,
window
,
long
front
 
all
from
this
sheltered
station
be
at
my
command
.
  
<EOS>
the
crow
sailing
overhead
perhaps
watch
me
while
I
take
this
survey
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
think
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
consider
I
be
very
careful
and
timid
at
first
,
and
that
gradually
I
grow
very
bold
and
reckless
.
<EOS>
a
peep
,
and
then
a
long
stare
;
and
then
a
departure
from
my
niche
and
a
straying
out
into
the
meadow
;
and
a
sudden
stop
full
in
front
of
the
great
mansion
,
and
a
protract
,
hardy
gaze
towards
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
affectation
of
diffidence
be
this
at
first
?
<EOS>
"
they
may
have
demand
;
"
what
stupid
regardlessness
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
hear
an
illustration
,
reader
.
  
<EOS>
a
lover
find
his
mistress
asleep
on
a
mossy
bank
;
he
wish
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
fair
face
without
wake
her
.
<EOS>
He
steal
softly
over
the
grass
,
careful
to
make
no
sound
;
he
pause
 
fancy
she
have
stir
:
he
withdraw
:
not
for
world
would
he
be
see
.
<EOS>
all
be
still
:
he
again
advance
:
he
bend
above
her
;
a
light
veil
rest
on
her
feature
<EOS>
:
he
lift
it
,
bend
lower
;
now
his
eye
anticipate
the
vision
of
beauty
 
warm
,
and
bloom
,
and
lovely
,
in
rest
.
<EOS>
how
hurried
be
their
first
glance
!
<EOS>
but
how
they
fix
!
<EOS>
how
he
start
!
<EOS>
how
he
suddenly
and
vehemently
clasp
in
both
arm
the
form
he
dare
not
,
a
moment
since
,
touch
with
his
finger
!
<EOS>
how
he
call
aloud
a
name
,
and
drop
his
burden
,
and
gaze
on
it
wildly
!
<EOS>
He
thus
grasp
and
cry
,
and
gaze
,
because
he
no
longer
fear
to
waken
by
any
sound
he
can
utter
 
by
any
movement
he
can
make
.
<EOS>
He
think
his
love
sleep
sweetly
:
he
find
she
be
stone
dead
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
with
timorous
joy
towards
a
stately
house
:
I
see
a
blacken
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
no
need
to
cower
behind
a
gate
-
post
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
to
peep
up
at
chamber
lattice
,
fear
life
be
astir
behind
them
!
<EOS>
no
need
to
listen
for
door
open
 
to
fancy
step
on
the
pavement
or
the
gravel
-
walk
!
<EOS>
the
lawn
,
the
ground
be
trodden
and
waste
:
the
portal
yawn
void
.
<EOS>
the
front
be
,
as
I
have
once
see
it
in
a
dream
,
but
a
well
-
like
wall
,
very
high
and
very
fragile
-
look
,
perforate
with
paneless
window
:
no
roof
,
no
battlement
,
no
chimney
 
<EOS>
all
have
crash
in
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
silence
of
death
about
it
:
<EOS>
the
solitude
of
a
lonesome
wild
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
letter
address
to
people
here
have
never
receive
an
answer
:
as
well
despatch
epistle
to
a
vault
in
a
church
aisle
.
<EOS>
the
grim
blackness
of
the
stone
tell
by
what
fate
<EOS>
the
Hall
have
fall
 
by
conflagration
:
but
how
kindle
?
<EOS>
what
story
belong
to
this
disaster
?
<EOS>
what
loss
,
besides
mortar
and
marble
and
wood
-
work
have
follow
upon
it
?
<EOS>
have
life
be

as
well
as

<EOS>
if
so

<EOS>
dreadful
question
<EOS>
:
there
be
no
one
here
to
answer
it
 
not
even
dumb
sign
,
mute
token
.
  
<EOS>
in
wander
round
the
shatter
wall
and
through
the
devastated
interior
,
I
gather
evidence
that
the
calamity
be
not
of
late
occurrence
.
<EOS>
winter
snow
,
I
think
,
have
drift
through
that
void
arch
,
winter
rain
beat
in
at
those
hollow
casement
;
for
,
amidst
the
drench
pile
of
rubbish
,
spring
have
cherish
vegetation
:
grass
and
weed
grow
here
and
there
between
the
stone
and
fall
rafter
.
<EOS>
and
oh
!
<EOS>
where
meantime
be
the
hapless
owner
of
this
wreck
?
<EOS>
in
what
land
?
<EOS>
under
what
auspex
?
<EOS>
My
eye
involuntarily
wander
to
the
grey
church
tower
near
the
gate
,
and
I
ask
,
"
be
he
with
Damer
de
Rochester
,
share
the
shelter
of
his
narrow
marble
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
some
answer
must
be
have
to
these
question
.
<EOS>
I
could
find
it
nowhere
but
at
the
inn
,
and
thither
,
ere
long
,
I
return
.
<EOS>
the
host
himself
bring
my
breakfast
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
I
request
him
to
shut
the
door
and
sit
down
:
I
have
some
question
to
ask
him
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
comply
,
I
scarcely
know
how
to
begin
;
such
horror
have
I
of
the
possible
answer
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
spectacle
of
desolation
I
have
just
leave
prepare
me
in
a
measure
for
a
tale
of
misery
.
<EOS>
the
host
be
a
respectable
-
looking
,
middle
-
aged
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
Thornfield
Hall

of
course

I
manage
to
say
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

live
there
once

<EOS>
"

you

<EOS>
not

<EOS>
"
I
be

add

<EOS>
the
late

seem
to
have

breathe
again

fully

by

could
hear
all
that

to
come

whatever
the
disclosure
may
be
 
with
comparative
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
since
he
be
not
in
the
grave

I
could
bear
,
I
think
,
to
learn
that
he
be
at
the
Antipodes

<EOS>
"
be
Mr.

live
at
Thornfield
Hall
now

I
ask
,
know
,
of
course
,
what
the
answer
would
be
,
but
yet
desirous
of
defer
the
direct
question
as
to
where
he
really
be

<EOS>
"
no

madam
 
<EOS>

no

no

I
suppose
you
be
a
stranger
in
these
part
,
or
you
would
have
hear
what
happen
last
autumn
,
 
Thornfield
Hall
be
quite
a
ruin
:
it
be
burn
down
just
about
harvest
-
time

<EOS>
a
dreadful
calamity
!
<EOS>
such
an
immense
quantity
of
valuable
property
destroy
:
hardly
any
of
the
furniture
could
be
save
.
<EOS>
the
fire
break
out
at
dead
of
night
,
and
before
the
engine
arrive
from
Millcote
,
the
building
be
one
mass
of
flame

<EOS>
It
be
a
terrible
spectacle

I
witness
it
myself

"
<EOS>
at
dead
of
night

I
mutter
.
<EOS>
yes
,
that
be
ever
the
hour
of
fatality
at
Thornfield

be
it
know
how

I
demand
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
guess

they
guess

indeed

I
should
say
it

ascertain
beyond

You

aware

he
continue

edge
his
chair
a
little
near

speak
low

that
there

She

close

people
even
for
some

absolutely
certain

<EOS>
no

see
her

they
only
know
by
rumour
that
such
a
person
be
at
the
Hall

and
who
or
what
she
be
it
be
difficult
to
conjecture

<EOS>
They
say
Mr.
Edward
have
bring
her
from
abroad
,

some
believe
she
have
be
his
mistress

a
queer
thing
happen
a
year
since
 
a
very
queer
thing

"
  
<EOS>
I
fear
now
to
hear
my

the
main
fact

this

turn
out

discovery

bring
about
in
the
strange
way

there
be
a
young
lady
,
a
governess
at
the
Hall
,
that
Mr.
Rochester
fall
in
 
"
  
"
but
the
fire
,
"
I
suggest
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
that
,
madam
 
that
Mr.
Edward
fall
in
love
with
.
<EOS>
the
servant
say
they
never
see
anybody
so
much
in
love
as
he
be
:
he
be
after
her
continually
.
<EOS>
They
use
to
watch
him
 
servant
will
,
you
know
,
madam
 
<EOS>
and
he
set
store
on
her
past
everything
:
for
all
,
nobody
but
him
think
her
so
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
small
thing
,
they
say
,
almost
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
her
myself
;
but
I
have
hear
Leah
,
the
house
-
maid
,
tell
of
her
.
<EOS>
Leah
like
her
well
enough
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
be
about
forty
,
and
this
governess
not
twenty
;
and
you
see
,
when
gentleman
of
his
age
fall
in
love
with
girl
,
they
be
often
like
as
if
they
be
bewitch
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
would
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
tell
me
this
part
of
the
story
another
time
,
"
I
say
;
"
but
now
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
wish
to
hear
all
about
the
fire
.
<EOS>
be
it
suspect
that
this
lunatic
,
Mrs.
Rochester
,
have
any
hand
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
hit
it
,
madam
:
<EOS>
it
be
quite
certain
that
it
be
her
,
and
nobody
but
her
,
that
set
it
go
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
woman
to
take
care
of
her
call
Mrs.
Poole
 
an
able
woman
in
her
line
,
and
very
trustworthy
,
but
for
one
fault
 
a
fault
common
to
a
deal
of
them
nurse
and
matron
 
<EOS>
she
_
keep
a
private
bottle
of
gin
by
her
_
,
and
now
and
then
take
a
drop
over
-
much
.
<EOS>
It
be
excusable
,
for
she
have
a
hard
life
of
it
:
but
still
it
be
dangerous
;
for
when
Mrs.
Poole
be
fast
asleep
after
the
gin
and
water
,
the
mad
lady
,
who
be
as
cunning
as
a
witch
,
would
take
the
key
out
of
her
pocket
,
let
herself
out
of
her
chamber
,
and
go
roam
about
the
house
,
do
any
wild
mischief
that
come
into
her
head
.
<EOS>
They
say
she
have
nearly
burn
her
husband
in
his
bed
once
:
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
about
that
.
<EOS>
however
,
on
this
night
,
she
set
fire
first
to
the
hanging
of
the
room
next
her
own
,
and
then
she
get
down
to
a
low
storey
,
and
make
her
way
to
the
chamber
that
have
be
the
governess
's
 
<EOS>
(
she
be
like
as
if
she
know
somehow
how
matter
have
go
on
,
and
have
a
spite
at
her
)
 
<EOS>
and
she
kindle
the
bed
there
;
but
there
be
nobody
sleep
in
it
,
fortunately
.
<EOS>
the
governess
have
run
away
two
month
before
;
and
for
all
Mr.
Rochester
seek
her
as
if
she
have
be
the
most
precious
thing
he
have
in
the
world
,
he
never
could
hear
a
word
of
her
;
and
he
grow
savage
 
<EOS>
quite
savage
on
his
disappointment
<EOS>
:
he
never
be
a
wild
man
,
but
he
get
dangerous
after
he
lose
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
alone
,
too
.
<EOS>
He
send
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
the
housekeeper
,
away
to
her
friend
at
a
distance
;
but
he
do
it
handsomely
,
for
he
settle
an
annuity
on
her
for
life
:
and
she
deserve
it
 
<EOS>
she
be
a
very
good
woman
.
<EOS>
Miss
Adele
,
a
ward
he
have
,
be
put
to
school
.
<EOS>
He
break
off
acquaintance
with
all
the
gentry
,
and
shut
himself
up
like
a
hermit
at
the
Hall
.

when
he
walk
just
like
a
ghost
about
the
ground
and
in
the
orchard
as
if
he
have
lose
his
sense
 
<EOS>
which
it
be
my
opinion
he
have
;
for
a
more
spirited
,
bolder
,
keener
gentleman
than
he
be
before
that
midge
of
a
governess
cross
him
,
you
never
see
,
madam
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
give
to
wine
,
or
card
,
or
racing
,
as
some
be
,
and
he
be
not
so
very
handsome
;
but
he
have
a
courage
and
a
will
of
his
own
,
if
ever
man
have
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
from
a
boy
,
you
see
:
and
for
my
part
,
I
have
often
wish
that
Miss
Eyre
have
be
sink
in
the
sea
before
she
come
to
Thornfield
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
Mr.
Rochester
be
at
home
when
the
fire
break
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
be
he
;
and
he
go
up
to
the
attic
when
all
be
burn
above
and
below
,
and
get
the
servant
out
of
their
bed
and
help
them
down
himself
,
and
go
back
to
get
his
mad
wife
out
of
her
cell
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
call
out
to
him
that
she
be
on
the
roof
,
where
she
be
stand
,
wave
her
arm
,
above
the
battlement
,
and
shout
out
till
they
could
hear
her
a
mile
off
:
<EOS>
I
see
her
and
hear
her
with
my
own
eye
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
big
woman
,
and
have
long
black
hair
:
we
could
see
it
stream
against
the
flame
as
she
stand
.
<EOS>
I
witness
,
and
several
more
witnessed
,
Mr.
Rochester
ascend
through
the
sky

light
on
to
the
roof
;
we
hear
him
call
"
Bertha

<EOS>
"
We
see
him
approach
her
;
and
then
,
madam
,
she
yell
and
give
a
spring
,
and
the
next
minute
she
lie
smash
on
the

It
be
all
his
own
courage

and
a
body
may
say
,
his
kindness

in
a
way

madam

he
would
not

every

get
ready

can

Ferndean
before
dark
this
day
,
I
will
pay
both
you
and
him
twice
the
hire
you
usually
demand
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
manor
-
house
of
Ferndean
be
a
building
of
considerable
antiquity
,
moderate
size
,
and
no
architectural
pretension
,
deep
bury
in
a
wood
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
often
speak
of
it
,
and
sometimes
go
there
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
purchase
the
estate
for
the
sake
of
the
game
cover
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
let
the
house
,
but
could
find
no
tenant
,
in
consequence
of
its
ineligible
and
insalubrious
site
.
<EOS>
Ferndean
then
remain
uninhabited
and
unfurnished
,
with
the
exception
of
some
two
or
three
room
fit
up
for
the
accommodation
of
the
squire
when
he
go
there
in
the
season
to
shoot
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
house
I
come
just
ere
dark
on
an
evening
mark
by
the
characteristic
of
sad
sky
,
cold
gale
,
and
continue
small
penetrating
rain
.
<EOS>
the
last
mile
I
perform
on
foot
,
have
dismiss
the
chaise
and
driver
with
the
double
remuneration
I
have
promise
.
<EOS>
even
when
within
a
very
short
distance
of
the
manor
-
house
,
you
could
see
nothing
of
it
,
so
thick
and
dark
grow
the
timber
of
the
gloomy
wood
about
it
.
<EOS>
iron
gate
between
granite
pillar
show
me
where
to
enter
,
and
pass
through
them
,
I
find
myself
at
once
in
the
twilight
of
close
-
rank
tree
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
grass
-
grow
track
descend
the
forest
aisle
between
hoar
and
knotty
shafts
and
under
branched
arch
.
<EOS>
I
follow
it
,
expect
soon
to
reach
the
dwelling
;
but
it
stretch
on
and
on
,
it
wind
far
and
farther
:
<EOS>
no
sign
of
habitation
or
ground
be
visible
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
take
a
wrong
direction
and
lose
my
way
.
<EOS>
the
darkness
of
natural
as
well
as
of
sylvan
dusk
gather
over
me
.
<EOS>
I
look
round
in
search
of
another
road
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
:
all
be
interweave
stem
,
columnar
trunk
,
dense
summer
foliage
 
<EOS>
no
opening
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
I
proceed
:
<EOS>
at
last
my
way
open
,
the
tree
thin
a
little
;
presently
I
beheld
a
railing
,
then
the
house
 
scarce
,
by
this
dim
light
,
distinguishable
from
the
tree
;
so
dank
and
green
be
its
decay
wall
.
<EOS>
enter
a
portal
,
fasten
only
by
a
latch
,
I
stand
amidst
a
space
of
enclose
ground
,
from
which
the
wood
sweep
away
in
a
semicircle
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
flower
,
no
garden
-
bed
;
only
a
broad
gravel
-
walk
girdle
a
grass
-
plat
,
and
this
set
in
the
heavy
frame
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
the
house
present
two
pointed
gable
in
its
front
;
the
window
be
lattice
and
narrow
<EOS>
:
the
front
door
be
narrow
too
,
one
step
lead
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
whole
look
,
as
the
host
of
the
Rochester
Arms
have
say
,
"
quite
a
desolate
spot
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
still
as
a
church
on
a
week
-
day
:
the
patter
rain
on
the
forest
leave
be
the
only
sound
audible
in
its
vicinage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
there
be
life
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
life
of
some
kind
there
be
;
for
I
hear
a
movement
 
<EOS>
that
narrow
front
-
door
be
unclose
,
and
some
shape
be
about
to
issue
from
the
grange
.
  
<EOS>
It
open
slowly
:
a
figure
come
out
into
the
twilight
and
stand
on
the
step
;
a
man
without
a
hat
:
he
stretch
forth
his
hand
as
if
to
feel
whether
it
rain
.
<EOS>
dusk
as
it
be
<EOS>
,
I
have
recognise
him
 
<EOS>
it
be
my
master
,
Edward
Fairfax
Rochester
,
and
no
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay
my
step
,
almost
my
breath
,
and
stand
to
watch
him
 
to
examine
him
,
myself
unseen
,
and
alas
!
<EOS>
to
him
invisible
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sudden
meeting
,
and
one
in
which
rapture
be
keep
well
in
check
by
pain
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
difficulty
in
restrain
my
voice
from
exclamation
,
my
step
from
hasty
advance
.
  
<EOS>
His
form
be
of
the
same
strong
and
stalwart
contour
as
ever
:
his
port
be
still
erect
,
his
hair
be
still
raven
black
;
nor
be
his
feature
alter
or
sink
:
not
in
one
year
's
space
,
by
any
sorrow
,
could
his
athletic
strength
be
quell
or
his
vigorous
prime
blight
.
<EOS>
but
in
his
countenance
I
see
a
change
:
that
look
desperate
and
brood
 
that
remind
me
of
some
wrong
and
fetter
wild
beast
or
bird
,
dangerous
to
approach
in
his
sullen
woe
.
<EOS>
the
cage
eagle
,
whose
gold
-
ring
eye
cruelty
have
extinguish
,
may
look
as
look
that
sightless
Samson
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
reader
,
do
you
think
I
fear
him
in
his
blind
ferocity
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
you
little
know
me
.
<EOS>
a
soft
hope
blest
with
my
sorrow
that
soon
I
should
dare
to
drop
a
kiss
on
that
brow
of
rock
,
and
on
those
lip
so
sternly
seal
beneath
it
:
but
not
yet
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
accost
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
He
descend
the
one
step
,
and
advanced
slowly
and
gropingly
towards
the
grass
-
plat
.
<EOS>
where
be
his
daring
stride
now
?
<EOS>
then
he
pause
,
as
if
he
know
not
which
way
to
turn
.
<EOS>
He
lift
his
hand
and
open
his
eyelid
;
gaze
blank
,
and
with
a
strain
effort
,
on
the
sky
,
and
toward
the
amphitheatre
of
tree
:
<EOS>
one
see
that
all
to
him
be
void
darkness
.
<EOS>
He
stretch
his
right
hand
(
the
left
arm
,
the
mutilated
one
,
he
keep
hide
in
his
bosom
)
;
he
seem
to
wish
by
touch
to
gain
an
idea
of
what
lie
around
him
:
he
meet
but
vacancy
still
;
for
the
tree
be
some
yard
off
where
he
stand
.
<EOS>
He
relinquish
the
endeavour
,
fold
his
arm
,
and
stand
quiet
and
mute
in
the
rain
,
now
fall
fast
on
his
uncovered
head
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
John
approach
him
from
some
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
my
arm
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
"
there
be
a
heavy
shower
come
on
:
have
you
not
better
go
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
alone
,
"
be
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
John
withdraw
without
have
observe
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
now
try
to
walk
about
:
vainly
,
 
all
be
too
uncertain
.
<EOS>
He
grope
his
way
back
to
the
house
,
and
,
re
-
enter
it
,
close
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
draw
near
and
knock
:
<EOS>
John
's
wife
open
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
I
say
,
"
how
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
start
as
if
she
have
see
a
ghost
:
I
calm
her
.
<EOS>
to
her
hurried
<EOS>
"
be
it
really
<EOS>
you
,
miss
,
come
at
this
late
hour
to
this
lonely
place
?
<EOS>
"
I
answer
by
take
her
hand
;
and
then
I
follow
her
into
the
kitchen
,
where
John
now
sit
by
a
good
fire
.
<EOS>
I
explain
to
them
,
in
few
word
,
that
I
have
hear
all
which
have
happen
since
I
leave
Thornfield
,
and
that
I
be
come
to
see
Mr.
Rochester
.
<EOS>
I
ask
John
to
go
down
to
the
turn-
pike
-
house
,
where
I
have
dismiss
the
chaise
,
and
bring
my
trunk
,
which
I
have
leave
there
:
and
then
,
while
I
remove
my
bonnet
and
shawl
,
I
question
Mary
as
to
whether
I
could
be
accommodate
at
the
Manor
House
for
the
night
;
and
find
that
arrangement
to
that
effect
,
though
difficult
,
would
not
be
impossible
<EOS>
,
I
inform
her
I
should
stay
.
<EOS>
just
at
this
moment
the
parlour
-
bell
rang
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
go
in
,
"
say
I
,
"
tell
your
master
that
a
person
wish
to
speak
to
him
,
but
do
not
give
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
will
see
you
,
"
she
answer
;
"
he
refuse
everybody
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
she
return
,
I
inquire
what
he
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
to
send
in
your
name
and
your
business
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
She
then
proceed
to
fill
a
glass
with
water
,
and
place
it
on
a
tray
,
together
with
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
what
he
ring
for
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
:
he

out

the

shake

this

up

up
with

bound
towards
me

knock
the

I
set
it
on

I
press

sweep

have
now

no

friend

cease

melancholy

shall
not

desolate

so
long

I
live

"
  
<EOS>
He
reply
not
:
he
seem
serious
 
abstract
<EOS>
;
he
sigh
;
he
half
-
open
his
lip
as
if
to
speak
:
he
close
them
again
.
<EOS>
I
feel
a
little
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
have
too
rashly
over
-
leap
conventionality
;
and
he
,
like
St.
John
,
see
impropriety
in
my
inconsiderateness
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
make
my
proposal
from
the
idea
that
he
wish
and
would
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
:
an
expectation
,
not
the
less
certain
because
unexpresse
,
have
buoy
me
up
,
that
he
would
claim
me
at
once
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
but
no
hint
to
that
effect
escape
him
and
his
countenance
become
more
overcast
,
I
suddenly
remember
that
I
may
have
be
all
wrong
,
and
be
perhaps
play
the
fool
unwittingly
;
and
I
begin
gently
to
withdraw
myself
from
his
arm
 
<EOS>
but
he
eagerly
snatch
me
closer
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
no
 
Jane
;
you
must
not
go

<EOS>
no
 
I
have
touch
you

hear
you

feel
the
comfort
of
your
presence
 
the
sweetness

your
consolation

I
can
not
give
up
these
joy

I
have
little
leave
in
myself

I
must
have
you

the
world
may
laugh
 
may
call
me
absurd
,
selfish
 
<EOS>

it
do
not
signify
.
<EOS>
My
very
soul
demand
you
:
it
will
be
satisfied
,
or
it
will
take
deadly
vengeance
on
its
frame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

I
will
stay
with
you

say
so

"
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
but
you
understand
one
thing
by
stay
with
me
;
and
I
understand
another

<EOS>
You
,
perhaps
,
could
make
up
your
mind
to
be
about
my
hand
and
chair
 
to
wait
on
me
as
a
kind
little
nurse
(
for
you
have
an
affectionate
heart
and
a
generous
spirit
,
which
prompt
you
to
make
sacrifice
for
those
you
pity
)
,
and
that
ought
to
suffice
for
me
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
should
now
entertain
none
but
fatherly
feeling
for
you
:
do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
come
 
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
will
think
what
you
like

I
be
content
to
be
only
your
nurse
,
if
you
think
it
better
.

<EOS>
"
but
you
can
not
always
be

nurse

Janet

you
be
young

you
must
marry
one
day

I
do
not
care
about

married

<EOS>

You
should
care

Janet

if
I
be
what
I
once
be
,
I
would
try
to
make
you
care
 
<EOS>
but
 
a
sightless
block
!

"
  
<EOS>
He
relapse
again
into
gloom
.
<EOS>
I
,
on
the
contrary
,
become
more
cheerful
,
and
take
fresh
courage
:
these
last
word
give
me
an
insight
as
to
where
the
difficulty
lie
;
and
as
it
be
no
difficulty
with
me
,
I
feel
quite
relieved
from
my
previous
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
I
resume
a
lively
vein
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
time
some
one
undertake
to
rehumanise
you
,
"
say
I
,
part
his
thick
and
long
uncut
lock
;
"
for
I
see
you
be
be
metamorphose
into
a
lion
,
or
something
of
that
sort

<EOS>
You
have
a
"
faux
air
"
of
Nebuchadnezzar
in
the
field
about
you
,
that
be
certain
:
your
hair
remind
me
of
eagle
'
feather

whether
your
nail

grow

claws

not

on

arm

neither
hand

nail

say

draw
the
mutilated
limb
from
his
breast
,
and
show
it
to
me
.

It
be
a
mere
stump
 
a
ghastly
sight

not
you
think
so

Jane

<EOS>

It
be
a
pity
to
see
it

a
pity
to
see
your
eye

the
scar
of
fire
on
your
forehead
:
and
the
bad
of
it
be
,
one
be
in
danger
of
love
you
too
well
for
all
this

make
too
much
of
you

I
think
you
would
be
revolt

Jane

when
you
see
my
arm

my
cicatrise
visage

do
you
?

do
not
tell
me
so

should
say
something
disparage

your
judgment

<EOS>
now
,
let
me
leave
you
an
instant
,
to
make
a
well
fire
,
and
have
the
hearth
sweep
up
.

Can
you
tell
when
there
be
a
good
fire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

with
the
right
eye
I
see
a
glow
 
a
ruddy
haze

no

Summoning
Mary

I
soon
have
the
room
in
more
cheerful
order

prepare

likewise

a
comfortable
repast

excited

pleasure

ease

vivacity

him

for
with
him
I
be
at
perfect
ease
,

I
know
I
suit
him
;
all
I
say

do
seem
either
to
console

revive
him

<EOS>
delightful
consciousness
!

It
bring
to
life

light
my
whole
nature

in
his
presence
I
thoroughly
live
;

live
in
mine

blind
as
he
be

smile
play
over
his
face

joy
dawn
on
his

his
lineament
soften
and
warm

after
supper

he
begin
to
ask
me
many
question

of
where
I
have
be
,
what
I
have
be
do
<EOS>
,
how
I
have
find
him
out
;

I
give
him
only
very
partial
reply
<EOS>
:
it
be
too
late
to
enter
into
particular
that
night
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
wish
to
touch
no
deep
-
thrill
chord
 
to
open
no
fresh
well
of
emotion
in
his
heart
:
my
sole
present
aim
be
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
Cheered
,
as
I
have
say
,
he
be
:
and
yet
<EOS>
but
by
fit
.
<EOS>
if
a
moment
's
silence
break
the
conversation
,
he
would
turn
restless
,
touch
me
,
then
say
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
You

on

you
so
suddenly
rise
on

hearth

stretch
my

do
nothing

expect
nothing

merge
night
in

feeling

the
sensation
of
cold
when
I
let
the
fire
go
out
,
of
hunger
when
I
forgot
to
eat
:
and
then
a
ceaseless
sorrow
,
and
,
at
time
,
a
very
delirium
of
desire
to
behold
my
Jane
again

yes

for
her
restoration
I
long
,
far
more
than

can
it

with

disturbed

,
I
be
sure

the
good

most
reassure
for

I
pass
my
finger
over
his
eyebrow

remark
that
they
be
scorch

that
I
would
apply
something

would

grow
as
broad

black
as

up

I
come
down
as
soon
as
I

there
be
a
prospect
of
breakfast
.
<EOS>
enter
the
room
very
softly
,
I
have
a
view
of
him
before
he
discover
my
presence
.
<EOS>
It
be
mournful
,
indeed
,
to
witness
the
subjugation
of
that
vigorous
spirit
to
a
corporeal
infirmity
.
<EOS>
He
sit
in
his
chair
 
still
,
but
not
at
rest
:
expectant
evidently
;
the
line
of
now
habitual
sadness
mark
his
strong
feature
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
remind
one
of
a
lamp
quench
,
wait

be
re

lit
 
and
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
not
himself
that
could
now
kindle
the
lustre
of
animated
expression

he
be
dependent
on
another
for
that
office
!
<EOS>
I
have
mean
to
be
gay
and
careless
,
but
the
powerlessness
of
the
strong
man
touch
my
heart
to
the
quick
:
still
I
accost
him
with
what
vivacity
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"

sunny
morning

singe
high
over

one

sunshine

be
in

presence

<EOS>
the
water
stand
in
my
eye
to
hear
this
avowal
of
his
dependence
;
just
as
if
a
royal
eagle
,
chain
to
a
perch
,
should
be
force
to
entreat
a
sparrow
to
become
its
purveyor
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
be
lachrymose
:
I
dash
off
the
salt
drop
,
and
busy
myself
with
prepare
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
the
morning
be
spend
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
I
lead
him
out
of
the
wet
and
wild
wood
into
some
cheerful
field
:
I
describe
to
him
how
brilliantly
green
they
be
;
how
the
flower
and
hedge
look
refresh
;
how
sparklingly
blue
be
the
sky
.
<EOS>
I
seek
a
seat
for
him
in
a
hidden
and
lovely
spot
,
a
dry
stump
of
a
tree
;
nor
do
I
refuse
to
let
him
,
when
seat
,
place
me
on
his
knee
.
<EOS>
why
should
I
,
when
both
he
and
I
be
happy
near
than
apart
?
<EOS>
pilot
lie
beside
us
:
all
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
He
break
out
suddenly
while
clasp
me
in
his
arm
    
"
cruel
,
cruel
deserter

what
do
I
feel
when
I
discover
you
have
flee
from
Thornfield
,
and
when
I
could
nowhere
find
you

and
,
after
examine
your
apartment
,
ascertain
that
you
have
take
no
money
,
nor
anything
which
could
serve
as
an
equivalent
!
<EOS>
a
pearl
necklace
I
have
give
you

tour

what
could
my
darling
do
,
I
ask
,
leave
destitute
and
penniless
?
<EOS>
and
what
do
she
do
?
<EOS>
let
me
hear
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
urge
,
I
begin
the
narrative
of
my
experience
for
the
last
year
.
<EOS>
I
soften
considerably
what
relate
to
the
three
day
of
wandering
and
starvation
,
because
to
have
tell
him
all
would
have
be
to
inflict
unnecessary
pain
:
the
little
I
do
say
lacerate
his
faithful
heart
deeper
than
I
wish
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
leave
him
thus
,
he
say
,
without
any
mean
of
make
my
way
:
I
should
have
tell
him
my
intention
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
confide
in
him
:
he
would
never
have
force
me
to
be
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
violent
as
he
have
seem
in
his
despair
,
he
,
in
truth
,
love
me
far
too
well
and
too
tenderly
to
constitute
himself
my
tyrant
:
he
would
have
give
me
half
his
fortune
,
without
demand
so
much
as
a
kiss
in
return
,
rather
than
I
should
have
fling
myself
friendless
on
the
wide
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
endure
,
he
be
certain
,
more
than
I
have
confess
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
whatever
my
suffering
have
be
,
they
be
very
short
,

I
answer
:
and
then
I
proceed
to
tell
him
how
I
have
be
receive
at
Moor
House
;
how
I
have
obtain
the
office
of
schoolmistress

perceive
,
of
course

the
drift
of
my
interlocutor

<EOS>
jealousy
have
get
hold
of
him

she
sting
him

the
ste
be
salutary

it
give
him
respite
from
the
gnawing
fang
of
melancholy

I
would
not

the

overwhelming
contrast

Your
word

delineate
very
prettily

graceful
apollo

present
to
your
imagination

tall

fair
,
blue-
eyed

and
with
a
grecian
profile

Your
eye
dwell
on

Vulcan

brown

broad

shouldered

blind
and
lame

I
have
wear
it
since
the
day
I
lose
my
only
treasure
,
as
a
memento
of
her
.

We
will
go
home
through
the
wood

Jane
!
<EOS>
you
think
me
,
I
daresay
,
an
irreligious
dog
:
<EOS>
but
my
heart
swell
with
gratitude
to
the
beneficent
God
of
this
earth
just
now
.
<EOS>
He
see
not
as
man
see
,
but
far
clear
:
<EOS>
judge
not
as
man
judge
,
but
far
more
wisely
.
<EOS>
I
do
wrong
:
I
would
have
sully
my
innocent
flower
 
<EOS>
breathe
guilt
on
its
purity
:
the
Omnipotent
snatch
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
,
in
my
stiff-
necked
rebellion
,
almost
curse
the
dispensation
:
instead
of
bend
to
the
decree
,
I
defy
it
.
<EOS>
divine
justice
pursue
its
course
;
disaster
come
thick
on
me
:
I
be
force
to
pass
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His
_
chastisement
be
mighty
;
and
one
smote
me
which
have
humble
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
be
proud
of
my
strength
:
<EOS>
but
what
be
it
now
,
when
I
must
give
it
over
to
foreign
guidance
,
as
a
child
do
its
weakness
?
<EOS>
of
late
,
Jane
 
<EOS>
only
 
only
of
late
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
see
and
acknowledge
the
hand
of
God
in
my
doom
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
experience
remorse
,
repentance
;
the
wish
for
reconcilement
to
my
Maker
.
<EOS>
I
begin
sometimes
to
pray
:
very
brief
prayer
they
be
,
but
very
sincere
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
day
since
:
nay
,
I
can
number
them
 
four
;
it
be
last
Monday
night
,
a
singular
mood
come
over
me
:
one
in
which
grief
replace
frenzy
 
sorrow
,
sullenness
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
have
the
impression
that
since
I
could
nowhere
find
you
,
you
must
be
dead
.
<EOS>
late
that
night
 
perhaps
it
may
be
between
eleven
and
twelve
o'clock
 
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
I
retire
to
my
dreary
rest
,
I
supplicate
God
,
that
,
if
it
seem
good
to
Him
,
I
may
soon
be
take
from
this
life
,
and
admit
to
that
world
to
come
,
where
there
be
still
hope
of
rejoin
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
my
own
room
,
and
sit
by
the
window
,
which
be
open
:
it
soothe
me
to
feel
the
balmy
night
-
air
;
though
I
could
see
no
star
and
only
by
a
vague
,
luminous
haze
,
know
the
presence
of
a
moon
.
<EOS>
I
long
for
thee
,
Janet
!
<EOS>
oh
,
I
long
for
thee
both
with
soul
and
flesh
!
<EOS>
I
ask
of
God
,
at
once
in
anguish
and
humility
,
if
I
have
not
be
long
enough
desolate
,
afflict
,
torment
;
and
may
not
soon
taste
bliss
and
peace
once
more
.
<EOS>
that
I
merit
all
I
endure
,
I
acknowledge
 
that
I
could
scarcely
endure
more
,
I
plead
;
and
the
alpha
and
omega
of
my
heart
's
wish
break
involuntarily
from
my
lip
in
the
word
 
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
speak
these
word
aloud
?

<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Jane
.
<EOS>
if
any
listener
have
hear
me
,
he
would
have
think
me
mad
<EOS>
:
I
pronounce
them
with
such
frantic
energy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
it
be
last
Monday
night
,
somewhere
near
midnight
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
the
time
be
of
no
consequence
:
what
follow
be
the
strange
point
.
<EOS>
You
will
think
me
superstitious
,
 
some
superstition
I
have
in
my
blood
,
and
always
have
:
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
this
be
true
 
true
at
least
it
be
that
I
hear
what
I
now
relate
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
I
exclaim
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
<EOS>
Jane
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
voice
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
whence
the
voice
come
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
whose
voice
it
be
 
reply
,
"
I
be
come
:
<EOS>
wait
for
me
;
"
and
a
moment
after
,
go
whisper
on
the
wind
the
word
 
"
where
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
if
I
can
,
the
idea
,
the
picture
these
word
open
to
my
mind
:
yet
it
be
difficult
to
express
what
I
want
to
express
.
<EOS>
Ferndean
be
bury
,
as
you
see
,
in
a
heavy
wood
,
where
sound
fall
dull
,
and
die
unreverberate
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
?
"
seem
spoken
amongst
mountain
;
for
I
hear
a
hill
-
send
echo
repeat
the
word
.
<EOS>
Cooler
and
fresher
at
the
moment
the
gale
seem
to
visit
my
brow
:
I
could
have
deem
that
in
some
wild
,
lone
scene
,
I
and
Jane
be
meet
.
<EOS>
in
spirit
,
I
believe
we
must
have
meet
.
<EOS>
You
no
doubt
be
,
at
that
hour
,
in
unconscious
sleep
,
Jane
:
perhaps
your
soul
wander
from
its
cell
to
comfort
mine
;
for
those
be
your
accent
 
<EOS>
as
certain
as
I
live
 
<EOS>
they
be
yours
!
"
  
<EOS>
reader
,
it
be
on
Monday
night
 
near
midnight
 
that
I
too
have
receive
the
mysterious
summon
:
those
be
the
very
word
by
which
I
reply
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
listen
to
Mr.
Rochester
's
narrative
,
but
make
no
disclosure
in
return
.
<EOS>
the
coincidence
strike
me
as
too
awful
and
inexplicable
to
be
communicate
or
discuss
.
<EOS>
if
I
tell
anything
,
my
tale
would
be
such
as
must
necessarily
make
a
profound
impression
on
the
mind
of
my
hearer
:
and
that
mind
,
yet
from
its
suffering
too
prone
to
gloom
,
need
not
the
deep
shade
of
the
supernatural
.
<EOS>
I
keep
these
thing
then
,
and
ponder
them
in
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
now
wonder
,
"
continue
my
master
,
"
that
when
you
rise
upon
me
so
unexpectedly
last
night
,
I
have
difficulty
in
believe
you
any
other
than
a
mere
voice
and
vision
,
something
that
would
melt
to
silence
and
annihilation
,
as
the
midnight
whisper
and
mountain
echo
have
melt
before
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
know
it
to
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
thank
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
me
off
his
knee
,
rise
,
and
reverently
lift
his
hat
from
his
brow
,
and
bend
his
sightless
eye
to
the
earth
,
he
stand
in
mute
devotion
.
<EOS>
only
the
last
word
of
the
worship
be
audible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
my
Maker
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
judgment
,
he
have
remember
mercy
.
<EOS>
I
humbly
entreat
my
Redeemer
to
give
me
strength
to
lead
henceforth
a
purer
life
than
I
have
do
hitherto
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
stretch
his
hand
out
to
be
lead
.
<EOS>
I
take
that
dear
hand
,
hold
it
a
moment
to
my
lip
,
then
let
it
pass
round
my
shoulder
:
be
so
much
low
of
stature
than
he
,
I
serve
both
for
his
prop
and
guide
.
<EOS>
We
enter
the
wood
,
and
wend
homeward
.
    
<EOS>
Reader
,
I
marry
him
.
<EOS>
a
quiet
wedding
we
have
:
he
and
I
,
the
parson
and
clerk
,
be
alone
present
.
<EOS>
when
we
get
back
from
church
,
I
go
into
the
kitchen
of
the
manor
-
house
,
where
Mary
be
cook
the
dinner
and
John
clean
the
knife
,
and
I
say
    
"
Mary
<EOS>
,
I
have
be
marry
to
Mr.
Rochester
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
housekeeper
and
her
husband
be
both
of
that
decent
phlegmatic
order
of
people
,
to
whom
one
may
at
any
time
safely
communicate
a
remarkable
piece
of
news
without
incur
the
danger
of
have
one
's
ear
pierce
by
some
shrill
ejaculation
,
and
subsequently
stun
by
a
torrent
of
wordy
wonderment
.
<EOS>
Mary
do
look
up
,
and
she
do
stare
at
me
:
the
ladle
with
which
she
be
baste
a
pair
of
chicken
roast
at
the
fire
,
do
for
some
three
minute
hang
suspend
in
air
;
and
for
the
same
space
of
time
John
's
knife
also
have
rest
from
the
polishing
process
:
<EOS>
but
Mary
,
bend
again
over
the
roast
,
say
only
    
"
<EOS>
have
you
,
Miss
?
<EOS>
well
,
for
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
short
time
after
she
pursue
 
<EOS>
"
I
seed
you
go
out
with
the
master
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
you
be
go
to
church
to
be
we
would

"
and
she
baste
away
.
<EOS>
John
,
when
I
turn
to
him
,
be
grin
from
ear
to
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
Mary
how
it
would
be
,
"
he
say
:
"
I
know
what
Mr.
Edward

(
John
be
an
old
servant
,
and
have
know
his
master
when
he
be
the
cadet
of
the
house
,
therefore
,
he
often
give
him
his
christian
name

<EOS>
"
I
know
what
Mr.
Edward
would
do
;
and
I
be
certain
<EOS>
he
would
not
wait
long
neither

<EOS>
and

right

for
aught

you
joy

"
<EOS>
and
he
politely
pull
his
forelock
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
John
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
tell
me
to
give
you
and
Mary
this
.
<EOS>
"
I
put
into
his
hand
a
five
-
pound
note
.
<EOS>
without
wait
to
hear
more
,
I
leave
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
in
pass
the
door
of
that
sanctum
some
time
after
,
I
catch
the
word
    
<EOS>
"
She
will
happen
do
better
for
him
nor
ony

grand
lady

<EOS>

again

fair
beautiful

may
see
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
write
to
Moor
House
and
to
Cambridge
immediately
,
to
say
what
I
have
do
:
fully
explain
also
why
I
have
thus
act
.
<EOS>
Diana
and
Mary
approve
the
step
unreservedly
.
<EOS>
Diana
announce
that
she
would
just
give
me
time
to
get
over
the
honeymoon
,
and
then
she
would
come
and
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
well
not
wait
till
then
,
Jane
,
"
say
Mr.
Rochester
,
when
I
read
her
letter
to
him
;
"
if
she
do
,
she
will
be
too
late
,
for
our
honeymoon
will
shine
our
life
long
:
its
beam
will
only
fade
over
your
grave
or
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
how
St.
John
receive
the
news
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
:
he
never
answer
the
letter
in
which
I
communicate
it
:
yet
six
month
after
he
write
to
me
,
without
,
however
,
mention
Mr.
Rochester
's
name
or
allude
to
my
marriage
.
<EOS>
His
letter
be
then
calm
,
and
,
though
very
serious
,
kind
.
<EOS>
He
have
maintain
a
regular
,
though
not
frequent
,
correspondence
ever
since
:
he
hope
I
be
happy
,
and
trust
I
be
not
of
those
who
live
without
God
in
the
world
,
and
only
mind
earthly
thing
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
not
quite
forget
little
Adele
,
have
you
,
reader
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
;
I
soon
ask
and
obtain
leave
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
to
go
and
see
her
at
the
school
where
he
have
place
her
.
<EOS>
Her
frantic
joy
at
behold
me
again
move
me
much
.
<EOS>
She
look
pale
and
thin
:
she
say
she
be
not
happy
.
<EOS>
I
find
the
rule
of
the
establishment
be
too
strict
,
its
course
of
study
too
severe
for
a
child
of
her
age
<EOS>
:
I
take
her
home
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
become
her
governess
once
more
,
but
I
soon
find
this
impracticable
;
my
time
and
care
be
now
require
by
another
 
my
husband
need
them
all
.
<EOS>
so
I
seek
out
a
school
conduct
on
a
more
indulgent
system
,
and
near
enough
to
permit
of
my
visit
her
often
,
and
bring
her
home
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
take
care
<EOS>
she
should
never
want
for
anything
that
could
contribute
to
her
comfort
<EOS>
:
she
soon
settle
in
her
new
abode
,
become
very
happy
there
,
and
make
fair
progress
in
her
study
.
<EOS>
as
she
grow
up
,
a
sound
english
education
correct
in
a
great
measure
her
french
defect
;
and
when
she
leave
school
,
I
find
in
her
a
pleasing
and
obliging
companion
:
docile
,
good
-
tempered
,
and
well
-
principle
.
<EOS>
by
her
grateful
attention
to
me
and
mine
,
she
have
long
since
well
repay
any
little
kindness
I
ever
have
it
in
my
power
to
offer
her
.
  
<EOS>
My
tale
draw
to
its
close
:
one
word
respect
my
experience
of
married
life
,
and
one
brief
glance
at
the
fortune
of
those
whose
name
have
most
frequently
recur
in
this
narrative
,
and
I
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
be
marry
ten
year
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
it
be
to
live
entirely
for
and
with
what
I
love
best
on
earth
.
<EOS>
I
hold
myself
supremely
blest
 
<EOS>
bl
beyond
what
language
can
express
;
because
I
be
my
husband
's
life
as
fully
as
he
be
mine
.
<EOS>
no
woman
be
ever
near
to
her
mate
than
I
be
:
ever
more
absolutely
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
weariness
of
my
Edward
's
society
:
he
know
none
of
mine
,
any
more
than
we
each
do
of
the
pulsation
of
the
heart
that
beat
in
our
separate
bosom
;
consequently
,
we
be
ever
together
.
<EOS>
to
be
together
be
for
us
to
be
at
once
as
free
as
in
solitude
,
as
gay
as
in
company
.
<EOS>
We
talk
,
I
believe
,
all
day
long
:
to
talk
to
each
other
be
but
a
more
animated
and
an
audible
thinking
.
<EOS>
all
my
confidence
be
bestow
on
him
,
all
his
confidence
be
devoted
to
me
;
we
be
precisely
suited
in
character
 
perfect
concord
be
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rochester
continue
blind
the
first
two
year
of
our
union
;
perhaps
it
be
that
circumstance
that
draw
us
so
very
near
 
that
knit
us
so
very
close
:
for
I
be
then
his
vision
,
as
I
be
still
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
literally
,
I
be
(
what
he
often
call
me
)
<EOS>
the
apple
of
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
see
nature
 
<EOS>
he
see
book
through
me
;
and
never
do
I
weary
of
gaze
for
his
behalf
,
and
of
put
into
word
the
effect
of
field
,
tree
,
town
,
river
,
cloud
,
sunbeam
 
of
the
landscape
before
us
;
of
the
weather
round
us
 
and
impress
by
sound
on
his
ear
<EOS>
what
light
could
no
longer
stamp
on
his
eye
.
<EOS>
never
do
I
weary
of
read
to
him
;
never
do
I
weary
of
conduct
him
where
he
wish
to
go
:
of
do
for
him
what
he
wish
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
pleasure
in
my
service
,
<EOS>
most
full
,
most
exquisite
,
even
though
sad
 
because
he
claim
these
service
without
painful
shame
or
damp
humiliation
.
<EOS>
He
love
me
so
truly
,
that
he
know
no
reluctance
in
profit
by
my
attendance
<EOS>
:
he
feel
I
love
him
so
fondly
,
that
to
yield
that
attendance
be
to
indulge
my
sweetest
wish
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
at
the
end
of
the
two
year
,
as
I
be
write
a
letter
to
his
dictation
,
he
come
and
bend
over
me
,
and
say
 
"
Jane
,
have
you
a
glitter
ornament
round
your
neck
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
gold
watch
-
chain
:
I
answer
"
yes
.
"
  
"
and
have
you
a
pale
blue
dress
on
?
"
  
{

<EOS>
I
have
.
<EOS>
He
inform
me
then
,
that
for
some
time
he
have
fancy
the
obscurity
cloud
one
eye
be
become
less
dense
;
and
that
now
he
be
sure
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
I
go
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
advice
of
an
eminent
oculist
;
and
he
eventually
recover
the
sight
of
that
one
eye
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
now
see
very
distinctly
:
he
can
not
read
or
write
much
;
but
he
can
find
his
way
without
be
lead
by
the
hand
:
the
sky
be
no
longer
a
blank
to
him
 
the
earth
no
longer
a
void
.
<EOS>
when
his
first
-
bear
be
put
into
his
arm
,
he
could
see
that
the
boy
have
inherit
his
own
eye
,
as
they
once
be
 
large
,
brilliant
,
and
black
.
<EOS>
on
that
occasion
,
he
again
,
with
a
full
heart
,
acknowledge
that
God
have
temper
judgment
with
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
My
Edward
and
I
,
then
,
be
happy
:
and
the
more
so
,
because
those
we
most
love
be
happy
likewise
.

Diana
and
Mary
Rivers

down
like
a

<EOS>
He
may
be
stern
;
he
may
be
exact
;
he
may
be
ambitious
yet

but
his
be
the
sternness
of
the
warrior
Greatheart
,
who
guard
his
pilgrim
convoy
from

Apollyon

<EOS>
His

"
Whosoever
will
