<EOS>
I
of
my
birth
and
parentage
  
<EOS>
I
be
bear
in
the
northern
part
of
this
united
kingdom
in
the
house
of
my
grandfather
,
a
gentleman
of
considerable
fortune
and
influence
,
who
have
on
many
occasion
signalize
himself
in
behalf
of
his
country
;
and
be
remarkable
for
his
ability
in
the
law
,
which
he
exercise
with
great
success
,
in
quality
of
a
judge
,
particularly
against
beggar
,
for
whom
he
have
a
singular
aversion
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
,
his
young
son
,
fall
in
love
with
a
poor
relation
,
who
live
with
the
old
gentleman
,
and
perform
the
office
of
house
-
keeper
;
whom
he
privately
espouse
;
of
which
marriage
I
be
the
first
fruit
.
     
<EOS>
during
her
pregnancy
,
a
dream
discompose
my
mother
so
much
,
that
my
father
,
tired
with
her
importunity
,
at
last
consult
a
seer
,
whose
favourable
interpretation
he
would
have
secure
before
-
hand
by
a
bribe
,
but
find
him
incorruptible
.
<EOS>
She
dream
,
she
be
deliver
of
a
tennis
-
ball
,
which
the
devil
(
who
to
her
great
surprize
,
act
the
part
of
a
midwife
)
strike
so
forcibly
with
a
racket
,
that
it
disappear
in
an
instant
;
and
she
be
for
some
time
inconsolable
for
the
loss
of
her
off
-
spring
;
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
she
behold
it
return
with
equal
violence
,
and
earth
itself
beneath
her
foot
,
whence
immediately
spring
up
a
goodly
tree
cover
with
blossom
,
the
scent
of
which
operate
so
strongly
on
her
nerve
that
she
awake
.
 
<EOS>
the
attentive
sage
,
after
some
deliberation
,
assure
my
parent
,
that
their
first
-
bear
would
be
a
great
traveller
,
that
he
would
undergo
many
danger
and
difficulty
,
and
at
last
return
to
his
native
land
,
where
he
would
flourish
with
great
reputation
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
how
truly
this
be
foretold
,
will
appear
in
the
sequel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
some
officious
person
inform
my
grandfather
of
familiarity
that
pass
between
his
son
and
housekeeper
,
which
alarm
him
so
much
,
<EOS>
that
,
a
few
day
after
,
he
tell
my
father
it
be
high
time
for
him
to
enter
into
the
holy
state
of
matrimony
,
and
that
he
have
provide
a
match
for
him
,
to
which
he
could
in
justice
have
no
objection
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
,
find
it
would
be
impossible
to
conceal
his
situation
much
longer
,
frankly
own
what
he
have
do
,
and
excuse
himself
for
not
have
ask
the
consent
of
his
father
,
by
say
,
he
know
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
;
and
that
,
have
his
inclination
be
know
,
my
grandfather
may
have
take
such
measure
as
would
have
effectually
put
the
gratification
of
it
out
of
his
power
:
he
add
,
that
no
exception
could
be
make
to
his
wife
's
virtue
,
birth
,
beauty
,
and
good
sense
,
and
as
for
fortune
,
it
be
beneath
his
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
,
who
keep
all
his
passion
(
except
one
)
in
excellent
order
,
hear
him
to
an
end
with
great
temper
;
and
then
calmly
ask
,
how
he
propose
to
maintain
himself
and
spouse
?
 
<EOS>
He
reply
,
he
could
be
in
no
danger
of
want
,
while
his
father
's
tenderness
remain
,
which
he
and
his
wife
would
always
cherish
with
the
utmost
veneration
;
that
he
be
persuade
his
allowance
would
be
suitable
to
the
dignity
and
circumstance
of
his
family
,
and
the
provision
already
make
to
his
brother
and
sister
,
who
be
happily
settle
under
his
protection
.
 
<EOS>
Your
brother
and
sister
,
say
my
grandfather
,
do
not
think
it
beneath
them
to
consult
me
in
an
affair
of
such
importance
as
matrimony
;
neither
(
I
suppose
)
would
you
have
omit
that
piece
of
duty
,
have
you
not
some
secret
fund
in
reserve
,
to
the
comfort
of
which
I
leave
you
,
with
a
desire
that
you
will
this
night
,
seek
out
another
habitation
for
yourself
and
wife
,
whither
in
a
short
time
,
I
will
send
you
an
account
of
the
expence
I
have
be
at
in
your
education
,
with
a
view
of
be
reimburse
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
have
make
the
grand
tour
 
<EOS>
you
be
a
polite
gentleman
 
<EOS>
a
very
pretty
gentleman
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
great
deal
of
joy
,
and
be
your
very
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
leave
my
father
in
a
situation
easily
imagine
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
he
do
not
long
hesitate
;
for
be
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
his
father
's
disposition
,
he
do
not
doubt
that
he
be
glad
of
this
pretence
to
get
rid
of
him
;
and
as
his
resolve
be
invariable
like
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
Persians
,
he
know
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
to
attempt
him
by
prayer
and
intreatie
;
so
without
any
farth
application
,
he
betake
himself
with
his
disconsolate
bedfellow
,
to
a
farm
-
house
,
where
an
old
servant
of
his
mother
dwell
;
there
they
remain
some
time
in
a
situation
but
ill
adapt
to
the
elegance
of
their
desire
and
tenderness
of
their
love
;
which
nevertheless
,
my
father
endure
,
rather
than
supplicate
an
unnatural
and
inflexible
parent
:
but
my
mother
,
foresee
the
inconveniencie
she
would
be
expose
to
,
if
she
must
be
deliver
in
this
place
(
and
her
pregnancy
be
very
far
advanced
)
without
communicate
her
design
to
her
husband
,
go
in
disguise
to
the
house
of
my
grandfather
,
hope
that
her
tear
and
condition
would
move
him
to
compassion
,
and
reconcile
him
to
an
event
which
could
not
otherwise
be
amend
.
 
<EOS>
She
find
mean
to
deceive
the
servant
,
and
be
introduce
as
an
unfortunate
lady
,
who
want
to
complain
of
some
matrimonial
grievance
<EOS>
,
it
be
my
grandfather
's
particular
province
to
decide
in
all
case
of
scandal
.
<EOS>
She
be
accordingly
admit
into
his
presence
,
where
discover
herself
,
she
fall
at
his
foot
,
and
in
the
most
affecting
manner
,
implore
his
forgiveness
;
at
the
same
time
,
represent
the
danger
that
threatne
not
only
her
life
,
but
that
of
his
own
grandchild
which
be
about
to
see
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
her
,
he
be
sorry
that
the
indiscretion
of
her
and
his
son
have
compel
him
to
make
a
vow
,
which
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
give
them
any
assistance
 
that
he
have
already
impart
his
thought
on
that
subject
to
her
husband
,
and
be
surprised
that
they
should
disturb
his
peace
with
any
further
importunity
.
 
<EOS>
this
say
,
he
retire
.
     
<EOS>
the
violence
of
my
mother
's
affliction
have
such
an
effect
on
her
constitution
,
that
she
be
immediately
seize
with
the
pain
of
childbed
;
and
have
not
an
old
maid
-
servant
to
whom
she
be
very
dear
,
afford
her
pity
and
assistance
,
at
the
hazard
of
incur
my
grandfather
's
displeasure
,
she
and
the
innocent
fruit
of
her
womb
must
have
fall
miserable
victim
to
his
rigour
and
inhumanity
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
friendship
of
this
poor
woman
,
she
be
carry
up
to
a
garret
,
and
immediately
deliver
of
a
man
-
child
,
the
story
of
whose
unfortunate
birth
,
he
himself
now
relate
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
be
inform
of
what
have
happen
,
fly
to
the
embrace
of
his
darling
spouse
,
and
while
he
load
his
off
spring
with
paternal
caress
,
could
not
forbear
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
on
behold
the
dear
partner
of
his
heart
(
for
whose
ease
he
would
have
sacrifice
the
treasure
of
the
east
)
stretch
upon
a
flock
-
bed
,
in
a
miserable
apartment
,
unable
to
protect
her
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
the
old
gentleman
be
ignorant
of
what
pass
,
tho
'
he
affect
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
and
pretend
to
be
very
much
surprize
,
when
the
son
of
his
deceased
eld
son
,
a
pert
boy
,
who
live
with
him
as
his
heir
apparent
,
acquaint
him
with
the
affair
;
he
determine
therefore
to
preserve
no
medium
,
but
immediately
(
on
the
third
day
after
her
delivery
)
send
her
a
peremptory
order
to
begone
,
and
turn
off
the
servant
who
have
preserve
her
life
.
<EOS>
this
behaviour
so
exasperate
my
father
,
that
he
have
recourse
to
the
most
dreadful
imprecation
,
and
on
his
bare
knee
implore
that
heaven
would
renounce
him
,
if
ever
he
should
forget
or
forgive
the
barbarity
of
his
fire
.
     
<EOS>
the
injury
which
this
unhappy
mother
receive
from
her
removal
in
such
circumstance
,
and
the
want
of
necessary
where
she
lodge
,
together
with
her
grief
and
anxiety
of
mind
,
soon
throw
her
into
a
languish
disorder
which
put
an
end
to
her
life
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
love
her
tenderly
,
be
so
affected
with
her
death
,
that
he
remain
six
week
deprive
of
his
sense
;
during
which
time
,
the
people
where
he
lodge
,
carry
the
infant
to
the
old
man
,
who
relent
so
far
,
on
hear
the
melancholy
story
of
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
's
death
,
and
the
deplorable
condition
of
his
son
,
that
he
send
the
child
to
nurse
,
and
order
my
father
to
be
carry
home
to
his
house
,
where
he
soon
recover
the
use
of
his
reason
.
 
<EOS>
whether
this
hard
-
hearted
judge
feel
any
remorse
for
his
cruel
treatment
of
his
son
and
daughter
;
or
(
which
be
more
probable
)
be
afraid
his
character
would
suffer
in
the
neighbourhood
;
he
profess
great
sorrow
for
his
conduct
to
my
father
,
whose
delirium
be
succeed
by
a
profound
melancholy
and
reserve
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
disappear
,
and
notwithstanding
all
imaginable
inquiry
,
could
never
be
hear
of
,
which
confirm
most
people
in
the
opinion
of
his
have
make
away
with
himself
in
a
fit
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
how
I
understand
the
particular
of
my
birth
,
will
appear
in
the
course
of
these
memoir
.

chapter
II
<EOS>
I
grow
up
 
be
hate
by
my
relation
 
send
to
school
 
neglect
by
my
grandfather
 
<EOS>
maltreat
by
my
master
 
season
to
adversity

<EOS>

against
the
pedant
 
debarred

to
my
grandfather
 
hunt
by
his
heir
 
<EOS>
demolish
the
tooth
of
his
tutor
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
want
some
,
who
suspect
my
uncle
of
be
concern
in
my
father
's
fate
,
on
the
supposition
that
they
would
all
share
in
the
patrimony
destine
for
him
:
and
this
conjecture
seem
support
by
reflect
,
that
in
all
his
calamity
they
never
discover
the
least
inclination
to
serve
him
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
by
all
the
artifice
in
their
power
,
feed
his
father
's
resentment
,
and
strengthen
his
resolution
of
leave
him
to
misery
and
want
.
 
<EOS>
but
people
of
judgment
treat
this
insinuation
as
an
idle
chimera
;
because
have
my
relation
be
so
wicked
as
to
consult
their
interest
by
commit
such
an
attrocious
crime
<EOS>
,
the
fate
of
my
father
would
have
extend
to
me
too
,
whose
life
be
another
obstacle
to
their
expectation
.
     
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
grow
apace
,
and
as
I
strongly
resemble
my
father
,
who
be
the
darling
of
the
tenant
,
I
want
nothing
which
their
indigent
circumstance
could
afford
:
but
their
favour
be
a
weak
resource
against
the
jealous
enmity
of
my
cousin
;
who
,
the
more
my
infancy
promise
,
conceive
the
more
implacable
hatred
against
me
;
and
before
I
be
six
year
of
age
,
have
so
effectually
blockade
my
grandfather
,
that
I
never
see
him
but
by
stealth
;
when
I
sometimes
make
up
to
his
chair
as
he
sit
to
view
his
labourer
in
the
field
:
on
which
occasion
,
he
would
stroak
my
head
,
bid
me
be
a
good
boy
,
and
promise
he
would
take
care
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
soon
after
send
to
school
at
a
village
hard
by
,
of
which
he
have
be
dictator
time
out
of
mind
:
<EOS>
but
as
he
neither
pay
for
my
board
,
nor
supply
me
with
clothe
,
book
,
and
other
necessary
I
require
,
my
condition
be
very
ragged
and
contemptible
,
and
the
schoolmaster
,
who
through
fear
of
my
grandfather
teach
me
gratis
,
give
himself
no
concern
about
the
progress
I
make
under
his
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
these
difficulty
and
disgrace
,
I
become
a
good
proficient
in
the
latin
tongue
;
and
as
soon
as
I
could
write
tolerably
,
pester
my
grandfather
with
letter
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
send
for
my
master
,
and
chid
him
severely
for
bestow
such
pain
on
my
education
,
tell
him
,
that
if
ever
I
should
be
bring
to
the
gallow
for
forgery
,
which
he
have
teach
me
to
commit
,
my
blood
should
lie
on
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
the
pedant
,
who
dread
nothing
more
than
the
displeasure
of
his
patron
,
assure
his
honour
that
the
boy
's
ability
be
more
owing
to
his
own
genius
and
application
,
than
to
any
instruction
or
encouragement
he
receive
;
that
,
although
he
could
not
divest
him
of
the
knowledge
he
have
already
imbibe
,
unless
he
would
impower
him
to
disable
his
finger
,
he
should
endeavour
,
with
G
-
d
's
help
,
to
prevent
his
future
improvement
.
    
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
he
punctually
perform
what
he
he
have
undertake
:
for
,
on
pretence
that
I
have
write
impertinent
letter
to
my
grandfather
,
he
cause
a
board
to
be
make
with
five
hole
in
it
,
through
which
he
thrust
the
finger
and
thumb
of
my
right
hand
,
and
fasten
it
by
whip
-
cord
to
my
wrist
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
I
be
effectually
debarr'd
the
use
of
my
pen
.
<EOS>
but
this
restraint
I
be
free
from
in
a
few
day
,
by
an
accident
which
happen
in
a
quarrel
between
me
and
another
boy
,
who
take
upon
him
to
insult
my
poverty
,
I
be
so
incensed
at
this
ungenerous
reproach
,
that
with
one
stroke
of
my
machine
,
I
cut
him
to
the
skull
,
to
the
great
terror
of
myself
and
school
-
fellow
,
who
leave
him
bleed
on
the
ground
,
and
run
to
inform
the
master
of
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
severely
punish
for
this
trespass
,
that
,
be
I
to
live
to
the
age
of
Methusalem
,
the
impression
it
make
on
me
would
not
be
efface
;
no
more
than
the
antipathy
and
horror
I
conceive
for
the
merciless
tyrant
who
inflict
it
.
<EOS>
the
contempt
which
my
appearance
naturally
produce
,
in
all
who
see
me
,
the
continual
want
I

barbarity
of

by

uncommon
genius

and
the
advice

direction
of
our
usher

who
have
serve
my
father
in
his
travel
,
I
make
a
surprising
progress
in
the
classick
,
writing
and
arithmetick
;
so
that
before
I
be
twelve
year
old
,
I
be
confessedly
the
good
scholar
in
the
school
:
<EOS>
this
qualification
,
together
with
a
boldness
of
temper

and
strength
of
make
,
which
have
subject
almost
all
my

give
me
such
influence
over
them
,
that
I
begin
to
form
cabal
against
my
persecutor
;
and
be
in
hope
of
be
able
to
bid
him
defiance
in
a
very
short
time
.
     
<EOS>
be
at
the
head
of
a
faction
consist
of
thirty
boy
,
most
of
them
of
my
own
age
,
I
be
determined
to
put
their
mettal
to
trial
,
that
I
may
know
how
far
they
be
to
be
depend
upon
,
before
I
put
my
grand
scheme
in
execution
:
with
this
view
we
attack
a
body
of
stout
apprentice
,
who
have
take
possession
of
a
part
of
the
ground
allot
to
us
,
for
the
scene
of
our
diversion
;
and
who
be
then
play
at
nine
-
pin
on
the
spot
:
but
I
have
the
mortification
to
see
my
adherent
route
in
an
instant
,
and
a
leg
of
one
of
them
break
in
his
flight
by
the
bowl
,
which
one
of
our
adversary
have
detach
in
pursuit
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
this
discomfiture
do
not
hinder
us
from
engage
them
afterwards
,
in
frequent
skirmish
which
we
maintain
by
throw
stone
at
a
distance
,
wherein
I
receive
many
wound
,
the
scar
of
which
still
remain
.
<EOS>
Our
enemy
be
so
harass
and
interrupt
by
these
alarm
,
that
they
at
last
abandon
their
conquest
,
and
leave
us
to
the
peaceable
enjoyment
of
our
own
territory
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
endless
to
enumerate
the
exploit
we
perform
in
the
course
of
this
confederacy
,
which
become
the
terror
of
the
whole
village

insomuch

that
when
different

one

court

His

to
grandpapa

<EOS>
His
sister
's
brat
have
be
too
well
take
care
of
,
 
Grandpapa
<EOS>
be
too
just
not
to
make
a
difference
between
an
unnatural
rebellious
son
,
and
his
dutiful
love
child
who
take
his
advice
in
all
thing
;
"
and
such
expression
,
be
level
against
him
with
great
violence
;
until
the
judge
at
length
command
silence
.
 
<EOS>
He
calmly
rebuke
my
uncle
for
his
unmannerly
behaviour
,
which
he
say
he
would
excuse
on
account
of
his
education
:
he
tell
him
he
have
be
very
kind
to
the
boy
,
whom
he
have
keep
at
school
seven
or
eight
year
,
although
he
be
inform
he
make
no
progress
in
his
learning
;
but
be
addict
to
all
manner
of
vice
,
which
he
the
rather
believe
,
because
he
himself
be
witness
to
a
barbarous
piece
of
mischief
he
have
commit
on
the
jaw
of
his
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
but
however
,
he
would
see
what
the
lad
be
fit
for
,
and
bind
him
apprentice
to
some
honest
tradesman
or
other
,
provide
he
would
mend
his
manner
,
and
behave
for
the
future
,
as
become
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
honest
tar
(
whose
pride
and
indignation
boil
within
him
)
answer
my
grandfather
;
that
it
be
true
he
have
send
him
to
school
,
but
it
have
cost
him
nothing
,
for
he
have
never
be
at
one
shill
expence
,
to
furnish
him
with
food
,
raiment
,
book
,
or
other
necessary
;
so
,
that
it
be
not
to
be
much
wonder
at
,
if
the
boy
make
small
progress
;
and
yet
,
whoever
tell
him
so
,
be
guilty
of
a
damn'd
lie
,
for
he
be
allow
by
those
who
understand
those
matter
,
to
be
the
good
scholar
of
his
age
,
in
all
the
country
;
the
truth
of
which
he
would
maintain
,
by
lay
a
wager
of
his
whole
half
year
's
pay
on
the
boy
's
head
;
 
<EOS>
(
with
these
word
he
pull
out
his
purse
,
and
challenge
the
company
.
)
 
<EOS>
neither
be
he
addict
to
vice
,
as
you
affirm
,
but
very
much
expose
to
ill
usage
,
by
your
neglect
,
on
which
occasion
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
,
he
never
fail
to
shew
his
spirit
,
which
have
be
misrepresent
to
you

<EOS>
as
for
what
happen
to
your
chaplain
,
I
be
only
sorry
,
that
he
do
not
knock
out
the
scoundrel
's
brain
,
instead
of
his
tooth

by

if
ever
I
come
up

he
have
better

<EOS>
thank
you
for
your
courteous
offer

of
bind
the

apprentice
to
a

I
suppose
you

Our

in

of
all
his

the
disappointment

<EOS>
a
few
week
after

inform

send
for

to
see
all
his
descendant
without
exception

<EOS>
in
obedience
to
this
summon
,
my
uncle
set
out
with
me
a
second
time
,
to
receive
the
last
benediction
of
my
grandfather
;
often
repeat
by
the
road
,
"

<EOS>
You
shall
see

you

see
the
effect
of
my
admonition

<EOS>
"
 
when
we
enter
his
chamber
,
which
be
crowd
with
his
relation
,
we
advance
to
the
bed
-
side
,
where
we
find
him
in
his
last
agony
,
support
by
two
of
his
grand

daughter
,
who
sit
on
each
side
of
him
,
sob
most
piteously
,
and
wipe
away
the
froth
and
slaver
as
it
gather
on
his
lip
,
which
they
frequently
kiss
with
a
shew
of
great
anguish
and
affection
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
or
not
he
perceive
my
uncle

who
approach
him
with
these
word
,
"

the

turn
his
sunken
eye
towards
us
,
 
when
my

go
on
.

"
here

<EOS>
this
homely
consolation
scandalize
the
company
so
much
,
and
especially
the
parson
,
who
probably
think
his
province

invade
,
that
we
be
oblige
to
retire
into
another
room
,
where
in
a
few
minute
,
we
be
convince
of
my
grandfather
's
decease
,
by
a
dismal
yell
utter
by
the
young
lady
in
his
apartment
;
whither
we
immediately
hasten
,
and
find
his
heir
,
who
have
retire
a
little
before
,
into
a
closet
under
pretence
of
give
vent
to
his
sorrow
,
ask
,
with
a
countenance
beslubbere
with
tear

if
his

certainly
dead

(
say
my

,
look
at
the

warrant
him
as
dead

<EOS>
Odd

<EOS>
now
my
dream
be
out
for
all
the

<EOS>
I

I
stand
upon
the
Fore

castle
,
and
see
a
parcel
of
carrion
crow
foul
of
a
dead
shark
that
float
along

the
devil
perch
on

in
the
likeness
of
a

who
,
d'ye

over

"
 
<EOS>
"
out

reprobate
(
cry
the
parson
)
out

blasphemous
wretch

<EOS>
Dost
thou
think
his
honour

soul

"
 
<EOS>
the
clamour
immediately
arise
,
and
my
poor
uncle
,
who
be
shoulder
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
,
be
oblige
to
lug
out
in
his
own
defence

swear
he
would
turn
out
for
no

I
would

I
warrant
you

"
     
<EOS>
to
avoid
any
farther
disturbance
,
one
of
my
grandfather
's
executor
,
who
be
present
,
assure
Mr
Bowling
,
that
his
nephew
should
have
all
manner
of
justice
;
that
a
day
should
be
appoint
,
after
the
funeral
,
for
examine
the
paper
of
the
deceased
,
in
presence
of
all
his
relation
;
till
such
time
every
desk
and
cabinet
in
the
house
should
remain
close
seal
;
and
that
he
be
very
welcome
to
be
witness
of
this
ceremony
,
which
be
immediately
perform
to
his
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
order
be
give
to
provide
mourning
for
all
the
relation
,
in
which
number
I
be
include
:
but
my
uncle
would
not
suffer
me
to
accept
of
it
,
until
I
should
be
assure
whether
or
no
I
have
reason
to
honour
his
memory
so
far
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
interval
,
the
conjecture
of
people
,
with
regard
to
the
old
gentleman
's
will
,
be
various
:
as
it
be
well
known
,
he
have
,
besides
his
landed
estate
,
which
be
worth
700l
per
annum
,
six
or
seven
thousand
pound
at
interest
.
<EOS>
some
imagine
,
that
the
whole
real
estate
(
which
he
have
greatly
improve
)
would
go
to
the
young
man
whom
he
always
entertain
as
his
heir
;
and
that
the
money
would
be
equally
divide
between
my
female
cousin
(
five
in
number
)
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
other
be
of
opinion
,
that
as
the
rest
of
his
child
have
be
already
provide
for
,
he
would
only
bequeath
two
or
three
hundred
pound
to
each
of
his
grand
-
daughter
,
and
leave
the
bulk
of
the
sum
to
me
,
to
atone
for
his
unnatural
usage
towards
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
important
hour
arrive
,
and
the
will
be
produce
in
the
midst
of
the
expectant
,
whose
look
and
gesture
form
a
groupe
that
would
have
be
very
entertaining
to
an
unconcerned
spectator
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
reader
can
scarce
conceive
the
astonishment
and
mortification
that
appear
,
when
an
attorney
pronounce
aloud
,
the
young

resolution

give
evident

not

himself
so
warmly
second

The

use
me
barbarously

<EOS>
I
form
a
project

my

speak
not

during
the
space
of

hour

whistle
with
great
vehemence
,
the
tune
of
,
why
should
we
quarrel
for
rich

&
c
his
visage
be
contract
all
the
while
into
a
most
formidable
frown
.
<EOS>
at
length
his
pace
be
increase
to
such
a
degree
,
that
I
be
often
leave
behind
a
considerable
way
,
which
when
he
perceive
,
he
would
wait
for
me
;
and
when
I
be
almost
up
with
him

call
out
in
a
surly
tone

<EOS>
then
lay
hold
of
me
by

haul
me
along
,
until
his
good
nature
(
of
which
he
have
a
good

and
reflection

get
the
well
of
his
passion

would
say

though
this

do
not

he
be
so
much
a
seaman
,
that
he
never
dreamt
<EOS>
I
could
have
any
objection
to
his
design
;
consequently
,
give
himself
no
trouble
in
consult
my
approbation
.
<EOS>
but
this
resolution
be
soon
dropt
,
at
the
advice
of
our
usher
,
who
assure
Mr
Bowling
,
it
would
be
a
thousand
pity
to
baulk
my
genius
,
which
would
certainly
,
one
day
,
make
my
fortune
on
shore
,
provide
it
receive
due
cultivation
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
,
this
generous
tar
determine
(
though
he
could
ill
afford
it
)
to
give
me
university
education
;
and
accordingly
,
settle
my
board
and
other
expence
,
at
a
town
not
many
mile
distant
,
famous
for
its
college
,
whither
we
repair
in
a
short
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
the
day
of
our
departure
,
the
school
-
master
,
who
no
longer
have
the
fear
of
my
grandfather
before
his
eye
,
lay
aside
all
decency
and
restraint
,
and
not
only
abuse
me
in
the
gross
language
his
rancour
could
suggest
,
as
a
wicked
profligate
,
dull
,
beggarly
miscreant
,
whom
he
have
teach
out
of
charity
;
but
also
inveigh
in
the
most
bitter
manner
against
the
memory
of
the
judge
(
who
by
the
bye
have
procure
that
settlement
for
him
)
<EOS>
hint
,
in
pretty
plain
term
,
that
the
old
gentleman
's
soul
be
damn'd
<EOS>
to
all
eternity
,
for
his
injustice
in
neglect
to
pay
for
my
learning
.
 
<EOS>
this
brutal
behaviour
,
add
to
the
suffering
I
have
formerly
undergo
,
make
me
think
it
high
time
to
be
revenge
of
this
insolent
pedagogue
.
<EOS>
have
consult
my
adherent
,
I
find
them
all
staunch
in
their
promise
to
stand
by
me
;
and
our
scheme
be
this
:
     
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
preceede
the
day
of
departure
for
the
university
,
I
be
to
take
the
advantage
of
the
usher
be
go
out
to
make
water
(
which
he
regularly
do
at
four
o'clock
)
and
shut
the
great
door
,
that
he
may
not
come
to
the
assistance
of
his
superior
.
<EOS>
this
be
do
,
the
assault
be
to
be
begin
,
by
my
advance
to
the
master
and
spit
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
be
second
by
two
of
the
strong
boy
in
the
school
,
who
be
devoted
to
me
;
their
business
be
to
join
me
in
drag
the
tyrant
to
a
bench
,
over
which
he
be
to
be
lay
,
and
his
bare
posterior
heartily
flog
with
his
own
birch
,
which
we
propose
to
wrest
from
him
in
the
struggle
;
but
if
we
should
find
him
too
many
for
us
<EOS>
all
three
,
we
be
to
demand
the
assistance
of
our
competitor
,
who
should
be
ready
to
reinforce
us
,
or
oppose
any
thing
that
may
be
undertake
by
the
rest
of
the
boy
for
the
master
's
relief
.
<EOS>
one
of
my
principal
assistant
be
call
Jeremy
Gawky
,
son
and
her
of
a
wealthy
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
the
name
of
the
other
,
Hugh
Strap
,
the
cadet
of
a
family
which
have
give
shoemaker
to
the
village
time
out
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
once
save
Gawky
's
life
,
by
plunge
into
a
river
where
he
be
on
the
point
of
be
drown
,
and
by
the
help
of
swimming
,
drag
him
ashore
;
I
have
often
rescue
him
from
the
clutch
of
those
whom
his
insufferable
arrogance
have
provoke
,
to
a
resentment
he
be
not
able
to
sustain
;
 
and
<EOS>
I
have
many
time
save
his
reputation
and
posterior
,
by
perform
his
exercise
at
school
;
so
that
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
if
he
have
a
particular
regard
for
me
and
my
interest
.
    
<EOS>
the
attachment
of
Strap
,
flow
from
a
voluntary
,
disintereste
inclination
,
which
have
manifest
itself
on
many
occasion
in
my
behalf
,
have
once
render
me
the
same
service
as
I
have
afford
to
Gawky
,
by
save
my
life
at
the
risk
of
his
own
;
and
often
fathered
offence
I
have
commit
,
for
which
he
suffer
severely
,
rather
than
I
should
feel
the
the
weight
of
the
punishment
I
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
champion
be
the
more
willing
to
engage
in
this
enterprize
,
as
they
intend
to
leave
the
school
next
day
,
as
well
as
I
;
the
first
be

by
his

into

country

the
other
be

to
a

bid
him
have

with
these
word

he
pull
out
some
fathom
of
cord

the
honest

no

protest
with
great
earnestness

that
he
would
allow
no

accuse

it
be
in
vain
to
resist

that
he
do
not

with
violence

only
to
hinder
him
from
raise
the
hue

cry
against

before

My

have
upbraided
this
arbitrary

tell
him
,
that
he
propose
to
give
him
a
little
discipline
for

which
he
immediately
put
in
practice

great

dexterity

application

think
himself
sufficiently

chapter
VI
<EOS>
I
make
great
progress
in
my
study
 
be
caress
by
every
body
 
my
female
cousin
take
notice
of
me
 
<EOS>
I
reject
their
invitation
 
<EOS>
they
be
incensed
and
conspire
against
me
 
<EOS>
I
be
leave
destitute
by
a
misfortune
that
befal
my
uncle
 
<EOS>
Gawky
's
treachery
 
my
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
now
capable
of
reflection
,
I
begin
to
consider
my
precarious
situation
;
that
I
be
utterly
abandon
by
those
whose
duty
it
be
to
protect
me
;
and
that
my
sole
dependance
be
on
the
generosity
of
one
man
,
who
be
not
only
expose
by
his
profession
,
to
continual
danger
,
which
may
one
day
deprive
me
of
him
for
ever
;
but
also
(
no
doubt
)
subject
to
those
vicissitude
of
disposition
,
which
a
change
of
fortune
usually
create
;
or
,
which
a
well
acquaintance
with
the
world
may
produce
:
 
for
I
always
ascribe
his
benevolence
to
the
dictate
of
a
heart
as
yet
undebauche
by
a
commerce
with
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
alarm
at
these
consideration
,
I
resolve
to
apply
myself
with
great
care
to
my
study
,
and
enjoy
the
opportunity
in
my
power
:
    
this
I
do
with
such
success
,
that
in
the
space
of
three
year
,
I
understand
Greek
very
well
,
be
pretty
far
advanced
in
the
mathematic
,
and
no
stranger
to
moral
and
natural
philosophy
:
logick
I
make
no
account
of
;
but
above
all
thing
,
I
value
myself
on
my
taste
in
the
Belle
Lettre
,
and
a
talent
for
poetry
,
which
have
already
produce
some
morceaus
,
that
bring
me
a
great
deal
of
reputation
.
<EOS>
these
qualification
add
to
a
good
face
and
shape
,
acquire
the
esteem
and
acquaintance
of
the
most
considerable
people
in
town
,
and
I
have
the
satisfaction
to
find
myself
in
some
degree
of
favour
with
the
lady
;
an
intoxicate
piece
of
good
fortune
,
to
one
of
my
amorous
complexion
!
<EOS>
which
I
obtain
,
or
at
least
preserve
,
by
gratify
their
propensity
to
scandal
,
in
lampoon
their
rival
.
 
<EOS>
two
of
my
female
cousin
live
in
this
place
,
with
their
mother
,
after
the
death
of
their
father
,
who
leave
his
whole
fortune
(
which
be
considerable
)
equally
divide
between
them
;
so
that
if
they
be
not
the
most
beautiful
,
they
be
at
least
the
rich
toast
in
town
;
and
receive
daily
the
address
of
all
the
beaux
and
cavalier
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
have
hitherto
be
look
upon
by
them
with
the
most
supercilious
contempt
,
which
I
endeavour
to
return
by
the
most
perfect
neglect
,
my
character
now
attract
their
notice
so
much
,
that
I
be
give
to
understand
,
I
may
be
honour
with
their
acquaintance
,
if
I
please
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
will
easily
perceive
,
that
this
condescension
either
flow
from
the
hope
of
make
my
poetical
capacity
subservient
to
their
malice
,
or
at
least
of
screen
themselves
from
the
lash
of
my
resentment
,
which
they
effectually
provoke
.
     
<EOS>
I
enjoy
this
triumph
with
great
rapture
;
and
not
only
reject
their
offer
with
disdain
,
but
,
in
all
my
performance
,
whether
satire
or
panegyric
,
industriously
avoid
mention
their
name
,
even
while
I
celebrate
those
of
their
intimate
,
which
mortify
their
pride
exceedingly
,
and
incense
them
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
render
themselves
universally
ridiculous
in
satisfy
their
resentment
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
stroke
of
their
revenge
consist
in
their
hire
a
poor
collegian
to
write
verse
against
me
,
the
subject
of
which
be
my
own
poverty
,
and
the
catastrophe
of
my
unhappy
parent
;
but
besides
the
badness
of
the
composition
(
of
which
they
themselves
be
ashamed
)
they
do
not
find
their
account
in
endeavour
to
reproach
me
with
those
misfortune
,
which
they
and
their
relation
have
intaile
upon
me
;
and
which
consequently
,
reflect
much
more
dishonour
on
themselves
,
than
on
me
,
who
be
the
innocent
victim
of
their
barbarity
and
avarice
.
 
<EOS>
find
this
plan
miscarry
,
they
find
mean
to
irritate
a
young
gentleman
against
me
,
by
tell
him
I
have
lampoon
his
mistress
;
and
so
effectually
succeed
in
the
quality
of
incendiary
,
that
this
enraged
lover
determine
to
seize
me
next
night
,
as
I
return
to
my
lodging
from
a
friend
's
house
that
I
frequent
;
with
this
view
,
he
wait
in
the
street
,
attend
by
two
of
his
companion
,
to
whom
he
have
impart
his
design
of
carry
me
down
to
the
river
,
in
which
he
propose
to
have
me
heartily
duck
,
notwithstanding
the
severity
of
the
weather
<EOS>
,
it
be
then
about
the
middle
of
December
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
stratagem
do
not
succeed
;
for
,
be
apprise
of
their
ambush
,
I
get
home
another
way
,
and
by
the
help
of
my
landlord
's
apprentice
,
empty
a
close
stool
out
of
the
garret
window
,
which
do
great
execution
upon
them
;
and
next
day
,
occasion
so
much
mirth
at
their
expence
,
that
they
find
themselves
under
a
necessity
of
leave
the
town
,
until
the
adventure
should
be
entirely
forget
.
     
<EOS>
My
cousin
(
though
twice
baffle
in
their
expectation
)
do
not
however
,
desist
from
persecute
me
,
who
have
now
enrage
them
beyond
a
possibility
of
forgiveness
,
by
detect
their
malice
,
and
prevent
its
effect
:
neither
would
I
have
find
them
more
humane
,
have
I
patiently
submit
to
their
rancour
,
and
bear
without
murmur
the
rigour
of
their
unreasonable
hate
;
for
,
I
have
find
by
experience
,
that
though
small
favour
may
be
acknowledge
,
and
slight
injury
atone
,
there
be
no
wretch
so
ungrateful
as
he
,
whom
you
have
most
generously
oblige
;
and
no
enemy
so
implacable
,
as
those
who
have
do
you
most
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
these
good
-
natured
creature
,
therefore
,
have
recourse
to
a
scheme
which
conspire
with
a
piece
of
bad
news
I
soon
after
receive
,
to
give
them
all
the
satisfaction
they
desire
:
this
plan
be
to
debauch
the
faith
of
my
companion
and
confident
,
and
prevail
on
him
to
betray
the
trust
I
repose
in
him
,
by
impart
to
them
the
particular
of
my
small
amour
,
which
they
publish
with
such
exaggeration
,
that
I
suffer
very
much
in
the
opinion
of
every
body
,
and
be
utterly
discard
,
by
the
dear
creature
whose
name
have
be
call
in
question
.
     
<EOS>
while
I
be
busied
in
trace
out
the
author
of
this
treachery
,
that
I
may
not
only
be
revenge
on
him
,
but
also
vindicate
my
character
to
my
friend
;
I
one
day
,
perceive
the
look
of
my
landlady
so
altered
,
when
I
go
home
to
dinner
,
that
upon
enquire
into
the
cause
,
she
screw
up
her
mouth
,
and
fix
her
eye
on
the
ground
,
tell
me
her
husband
have
receive
a
letter
from
Mr
Bowling
,
with
one
inclose
for
me
 
<EOS>
she
be
very
sorry
for
what
have
happen
,
both
for
my
sake
,
and
his
own
 
People
should
be
more
cautious
of
their
conduct
 
<EOS>
she
be
always
afraid
his
brutal
behaviour
would
bring
him
into
some
misfortune
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
her
part
,
she
would
be
very
ready
to
befriend
me
;
but
she
have
a
small
family
of
her
own
to
maintain
.
 
<EOS>
the
world
would
do
nothing
for
her
if
she
should
come
to
want
 
charity
begin
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
wish
I
have
be
bind
to
some
substantial
handicraft
,
such
as
a
weaver
or
shoemaker
,
rather
than
loiter
away
my
time
in
learn
foolish
nonsense
that
would
never
bring
me
in
a
penny
 
<EOS>
but
some
folk
be
wise
,
and
some
be
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
listen
to
this
mysterious
discourse
,
with
great
amazement
,
when
her
husband
enter
,
and
without
speak
a
syllable
,
put
both
the
letter
into
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
receive
them

,
and
read
what
follow
:

Roger

SIR

date
from
Port

be
no
sooner
read
,
than
the
apothecary
shake
his
head
,
begin
:
     
"
I
have
a
very
great
regard
for
Mr
Bowling
<EOS>
,
that
be
certain
,
 
and
could
be
well
content
 
<EOS>
but
time
be
very
hard

<EOS>
there
be
no
such
thing
as
money
to
be
get
 
<EOS>
I
believe
'
tis
all
vanish
under
-
ground
,
for
my
part

<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
be
out
of
pocket
already
,
have
entertain
you
since
the
beginning
of
this
month
,
without
receive
a
six
-
pence
,
 
and
G
-
d
know
if
ever
I
shall
;
 
for
I
believe
it
will
go
hard
with
your
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
and
more
than
that
,
I
be
think
of
give
you
warn
,
for
I
want
your
apartment
for
a
new
"
prentice
,
whom
I
expect
from
the
country
every
hour
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
desire
you
will
this
week
provide
yourself
with
another
lodging
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
indignation
which
this
harangue
inspire
,
give
me
spirit
to
support
my
reverse
of
fortune
;
and
to
tell
him
,
I
despise
his
mean
,
selfish
disposition
so
much
,
that
I
would
rather
starve
than
be
behold
to
him
for
one
single
meal
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
out
of
my
pocket
-
money
,
I
pay
him
to
the
last
farthing
of
what
I
owe
,
and
assure
him
,
I
would
not
sleep
another
night
under
his
roof
.
 
<EOS>
this
say
,
I
sally
out
,
in
a
transport
of
rage
and
sorrow
,
without
know
whither
to
fly
for
shelter
,
have
not
one
friend
in
the
world
capable
of
relieve
me
,
and
only
three
shilling
in
my
purse
.
     
<EOS>
after
give
way
for
a
few
minute
to
the
dictate
of
my
rage
,
I
go
and
hire
a
small
bed
-
room
at
the
rate
of
one
shilling
and
six
-
pence
per
week
,
which
I
be
oblige
to
pay
per
-
advance
,
before
the
landlord
would
receive
me
;
hither
I
remove
my
luggage
;
and
next
morning
get
up
,
with
a
view
of
crave
the
advice
and
assistance
of
a
person
who
have
on
all
occasion
,
load
me
with
caress
,
and
make
frequent
offer
of
friendship
,
while
I
be
under
no
necessity
of
accept
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
me
with
his
wonted
affability
,
and
insist
on
my
breakfasting
with
him
,
which
I
do
not
think
fit
to
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
communicate
the
occasion
of
my
visit
,
he
appear
so
disconcert
<EOS>
,
that
I
conclude
him
wonderfully
affected
with
the
misery
of
my
condition
,
and
look
upon
him
as
a
man
of
the
most
extensive
sympathy
and
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
no
leave
me
long
under
this
mistake
;
for
recover
himself
out
of
his
confusion
,
he
tell
me
,
he
be
grieve
at
my
misfortune
,
and
desire
to
know
what
have
pass
between
my
landlord
Mr
Potion
and
me
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
recount
the
conversation
;
and
when
I
repeat
the
answer
I
make
to
his
ungenerous
remonstrance
with
regard
to
my
leave
his
house
,
this
pretend
friend
affect
a
stare
,
and
exclaim
,
"
be
it
possible
you
could
behave
so
ill
to
the
man
who
have
treat
you
so
kindly
all
along
?
"
 
<EOS>
My
surprise
at
hear
this
,
be
not
at
all
affect
,
whatever
his
may
be
;
and
I
give
him
to
understand
,
with
some
warmth
,
that
I
do
not
imagine
he
would
so
unreasonably
espouse
the
cause
of
a
scoundrel
,
who
ought
to
be
expel
from
every
social
community
.
 
<EOS>
this
heat
of
mine
,
give
him
all
the
advantage
he
desire
over
me
,
and
our
discourse
(
after
much
altercation
)
conclude
in
his
desire
never
to
see
me
again
in
that
place
;
to
which
I
yield
my
consent
,
assure
him
,
that
have
I
be
as
well
acquaint
with
his
principle
formerly
as
I
be
now
,
he
never
should
have
have
an
opportunity
to
make
that
request
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
we
part
.
    
<EOS>
on
my
return
,
I
meet
my
old
comrade
"
squire
Gawky
,
whom
his
father
have
send
,
some
time
ago
,
to
town
,
for
his
improvement
in
writing
,
dancing
,
fence
;
and
to
see
the
world
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
live
with
him
,
since
his
arrival
,
on
the
footing
of
our
old
intimacy
,
I
make
no
scruple
of
inform
him
of
the
lowness
of
my
circumstance
,
and
ask
a
small
supply
of
money
,
to
answer
my
present
expence
;
upon
which
he
pull
out
an
handful
of
half
-
pence
with
a
shilling
or
two
among
them
,
and
swear
that
be
all
he
have
to
keep
his
pocket
till
next
quarter
day
;
have
lose
the
great
part
of
his
allowance
the
night
before
at
billiard
.
<EOS>
though
this
may
very
well
be
true
,
I
be
extremely
mortify
at
his
indifference
;
for
he
neither
discover
any
sympathy
for
my
mishap
,
nor
desire
of
alleviate
my
distress
;
and
accordingly
,
I
leave
him
without
utter
one
word
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
afterwards
understand
,
that
he
be
the
person
who
have
formerly
betray
me
to
the
malice
of
my
cousin
,
to
whom
likewise
he
have
carry
the
tiding
of
my
forlorn
situation
,
which
afford
them
great
matter
of
triumph
and
exultation
,
I
determine
with
myself
to
call
him
to
a
severe
account
;
for
which
purpose
,
I
borrow
a
sword
,
and
write
a
challenge
,
desire
him
to
meet
me
at
a
certain
time
and
place
,
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
of
punish
his
perfidy
,
at
the
expence
of
his
blood
.
     
<EOS>
He
accept
the
invitation
,
and
I
betook
myself
to
the
field
,
though
not
without
feel
considerable
repugnance
to
the
combat
,
which
frequently
attack
me
in
cold
sweat
by
the
way
;
 
but
the
desire
of
revenge
,
the
shame
of
retract
,
and
hope
of
conquest
,
conspire
to
repel
these
unmanly
symptom
of
fear
;
and
I
appear
on
the
plain
with
a
good
grace
<EOS>
:
there
I
wait
an
hour
beyond
the
time
appoint
,
and
be
not
ill
pleased
to
find
he
have
no
mind
to
meet
me
;
because
now
I
should
have
an
opportunity
of
expose
his
cowardice
,
display
my
own
courage
,
and
of
beat
him
soundly
wheresoever
<EOS>
I
should
find
him
,
without
any
dread
of
the
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
elevate
with
these
suggestion
,
which
entirely
banish
all
thought
of
my
deplorable
condition
,
I
go
directly
to
Gawky
's
lodging
,
where
I
be
inform
of
his
precipitate
retreat
,
he
have
set
out
for
the
country
in
less
than
an
hour
after
he
have
receive
my
billet
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
I
be
vain
enough
to
have
the
whole
story
insert
in
the
news
,
although
I
be
fain
to
sell
a
gold
-
laced
hat
to
my
landlord
,
for
less
than
half
-
price
,
to
defray
the
expence
,
and
contribute
to
my
subsistence
.

me
to

<EOS>
assist
me
with

I
set
out
for
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
fume
of
my
resentment
be
dissipate
,
as
well
as
the
vanity
of
my
success
<EOS>
,
I
find
myself
desert
to
all
the
horror
of
extreme
want
,
and
avoid
by
mankind
as
a
creature
of
a
different
specie
,
or
rather
as
a
solitary
being
,
no
way
comprehend
within
the
scheme
or

of
providence
.
    
<EOS>
My
despair
have
render
me
almost
quite
stupified
,
when
I
be
one
day
tell
,
that
a
gentleman
desire
to
see
me
,
at
a
certain
publick
house
,
whither
immediately
I
repair
;
and
be
introduce
to
one
Mr
Launcelot
crab
a
surgeon
in
town
,
who
be
engage
with
two
more
,
in
drink
a
liquor
call
pop
-
in
,
compose
by
toss
a
quartern
of
brandy
into
a
quart
of
small
beer
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
relate
the
occasion
of
this
message
,
I
believe
it
will
not
be
disagreeable
to
the
reader
,
if
I
describe
the
gentleman
who
send
for
me
,
and
mention
some
circumstance
of
his
character
and
conduct
,
which
may
illustrate
what
follow
,
and
account
for
his
behaviour
to
me
.
    
<EOS>
this
member
of
the
faculty
be
age
fifty
,
about
five
foot
high
,
and
ten
round
the
belly
;
his
face
be
capacious
as
a
full
moon
,
and
much
of
the
complexion
of
a
mulberry
:
his
nose
resemble
a
powder
-
horn
,
be
swell
to
an
enormous
size
,
and
stud
all
over
with
carbuncle
;
and
his
little
grey
eye
reflect
the
ray
in
such
an
oblique
manner
,
that
while
he
look
a
person
full
in
the
face
,
one
would
have
imagine
he
be
admire
the
buckle
of
his
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
long
entertain
an
implacable
resentment
against
Potion
,
who
,
tho
'
a
young
practitioner
,
have
engross
more
business
than
he
,
and
once
have
the
assurance
to
perform
a
cure
,
whereby
he
disappoint
and
disgrace
the
prognostic
of
the
say
Crab
.
     
<EOS>
this
quarrel
,
which
be
at
one
time
upon
the
point
of
be
make
up
,
by
the
interposition
and
mediation
of
friend
,
have
be
lately
inflame
beyond
a
possibility
of
reconciliation
by
the
respective
wife
of
the
opponent
,
who
,
chance
to
meet
at
a
christening
,
disagree
about
precedence
,
proceed
from
invective
to
blow
,
and
be
with
great
difficulty
,
by
the
gossip
,
prevent
from
convert
the
occasion
of
joy
,
into
a
scene
of
blood
.
    
<EOS>
the
difference
between
these
rival
be
in
the
height
of
rancour
,
when
I
be
send
for
by
Crab
,
who
receive
me
as
civilly
as
I
could
have
expect
from
one
of
his
disposition
;
and
after
desire
me
to
sit
,
enquire
into
the
particular
of
my
leave
the
house
of
Potion
;
which
when
I
have
relate
,
he
say
with
a
malicious
grin
,
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
sneak
dog
!
 
<EOS>
I
always
think
him
a
fellow
without
a
soul
,
d####n
me
!
 
<EOS>
a
canting
scoundrel
,
who
have
creep
into
business
by
his
hypocrisy
,
and
kiss
the
a####se
of
every
body
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
(
say
another
)
<EOS>
one
may
see
with
half
an
eye
,
that
the
rascal
have
no
honesty
in
him
,
by
his
go
so
regularly
to
church
.
<EOS>
"
this
sentence
be
confirm
by
the
third
,
who
assure
his
companion
,
that
Potion
be
never
know
to
be
disguise
in
liquor
but
once
,
at
a
meeting
of
the
godly
,
where
he
have
distinguish
himself
by
an
extempore
prayer
an
hour
long
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
preamble
,
Crab
address
himself
to
me
in
these
word
,
"
well
,
my
lad
,
I
have
hear
a
good
character
of
you
,
and
I
will
do
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
send
your
thing
to
my
house
when
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
give
order
for
your
reception
.
 
<EOS>
Z####ds
!
<EOS>
what
do
the
booby
stare
at
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
no
mind
to
embrace
my
courteous
offer
,
you
may
let
it
alone
and
be
d
-
n'd
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
answer
with
"
a
submissive
bow
,
that
I
be
far
from
reject
his
friendly
offer
,
of
which
I
would
immediately
avail
myself
,
as
soon
as
he
should
inform
me
,
on
what
footing
I
should
be
entertain
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
foot
(
d####n
my
blood
,
cry
he
)
d'ye
<EOS>
expect
to
have
a
footman
and
couple
of
horse
keep
for
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
no
,
Sir
(
I
reply
)
<EOS>
my
expectation
be
not
quite
so
sanguine
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
may
be
as
little
burthensome
as
possible
,
I
would
willingly
serve
in
your
shop
,
by
which
mean
I
may
save
you
the
expence
of
a
journey
-
man
,
or
porter
at
least
,
for
I
understand
a
little
pharmacy
,
have
employ
some
of
my
leisure
hour
in
the
practice
of
that
art
,
while
I
live
with
Mr
Potion
:
neither
be
I
altogether
ignorant
of
surgery
,
which
I
have
study
with
great
pleasure
and
application
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
ho
!
<EOS>
you
do
(
say
Crab
.
)
<EOS>
gentleman
,
here
be
a
compleat
artist
!
 
<EOS>
studied
surgery
!
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
in
book
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
you
dispute
with
me
,
<EOS>
one
of
these
day
,
on
point
of
my
profession
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
already
account
for
muscular
motion
(
I
warrant
)
and
explain
the
mystery
of
the
brain
and
nerve
 
ha
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
too
learned
for
me
,
d####n
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
's
hear
no
more
of
this
stuff
,
 
can
you
bleed
and
give
a
clyster
,
spread
a
plaister
and
prepare
a
potion
?
<EOS>
answer
me
to
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
my
answer
him
in
the
affirmative
,
he
shake
his
head
,
tell
me
,
he
believe
he
should
have
little
good
of
me
,
for
all
my
promise
;
 
but
however
,
he
would
take
me
in
for
the
sake
of
charity
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
accordingly
that
very
night
admit
to
his
house
,
and
have
an
apartment
assign
to
me
in
the
garret
,
which
I
be
fain
to
put
up
with
,
notwithstanding
the
mortification
my
pride
suffer
in
this
change
of
circumstance
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
soon
convince
of
the
real
motive
which
induce
Crab
to
receive
me
in
this
manner
:
for
besides
the
gratification
of
his
revenge
,
in
expose
the
selfishness
of
his
antagonist
,
in
opposition
to
his
own
generosity
,
which
be
all
affectation
,
he
have
occasion
for
a
young
man
who
understand
something
of
the
profession
,
to
fill
up
the
place
of
his
eld
apprentice
,
lately
dead
,
not
without
violent
suspicion
of
foul
play
from
his
master
's
brutality
.
 
<EOS>
the
knowledge
of
this
,
together
with
his
daily
behaviour
to
his
wife
,
and
the
young
apprentice
,
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
my
enjoy
my
new
situation
with
ease
;
however
,
as
I
do
not
perceive
how
I
could
bestow
myself
to
well
advantage
,
I
resolve
to
study
Crab
's
temper
with
all
the
application
,
and
manage
it
with
all
the
address
<EOS>
I
be
master
of
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
long
before
I
find
out
a
strange
peculiarity
of
humour
,
which
govern
his
behaviour
towards
all
his
dependant
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
when
he
be
pleased
,
he
be
such
a
niggard
of
his
satisfaction
,
that
if
his
wife
or
servant
betray
the
leaft
symptom
of
participation
,
he
be
offend
to
an
insupportable
degree
of
choler
and
fury
,
the
effect
of
which
they
seldom
fail
to
feel
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
his
indignation
be
rouse
,
submission
and
soothe
always
exasperate
it
beyond
the
bound
of
reason
and
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
pursue
a
contrary
plan
;
and
one
day
,
when
he
honour
me
with
the
name
of
ignorant
whelp
and
lazy
ragamuffin
 
I
boldly
reply
,
I
be
neither
ignorant
nor
lazy
,
since
I
both
understand
,
and
perform
my
business
as
well
as
he
could
do
for
his
soul
:
<EOS>
neither
be
it
just
to
call
me
ragamuffin
,
for
I
have
a
whole
coat
on
my
back
,
and
be
descend
from
a
well
family
than
any
he
could
boast
an
alliance
with
.
    
<EOS>
He
give
token
of
great
amazement
at
this
assurance
of
mine
,
and
shake
his
cane
over
my
head
,
regard
me
all
the
time
with
a
countenance
truly
diabolical
.
<EOS>
although
I
be
terribly
startled
at
his
menacing
look
and
posture
,
I
yet
have
reflection
enough
leave
,
to
convince
me
,
I
have
go
too
far
to
retract
,
and
that
this
be
the
critical
minute
which
must
decide
my
future
lot
,
in
his
service
;
whereupon
I
snatch
up
the
pestle
of
a
mortar
,
and
swear
if
he
offer
to
strike
me
without
cause
,
I
would
see
whether
his
scull
or
my
weapon
be
hard
.
 
<EOS>
He
continue
silent
for
some
time
,
and
at
last
break
forth
into
these
ejaculation
,
 
"
this
be
fine
usage
from
a
servant
to
a
master
,
 
very
fine
!
 
<EOS>
damnation
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
no
matter
,
you
shall
pay
for
this
,
you
dog
,
you
shall
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
your
business
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
will
teach
you
to
lift
your
hand
against
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
retire
and
lest
me
under
dreadful
apprehension
,
which
vanish
intirely
at
our
next
meeting
,
when
he
behave
with
unusual
complacency
,
and
treat
me
with
a
glass
of
punch
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
conduct
,
I
get
the
ascendency
over
him
in
a
short
time
,
and
become
so
necessary
to
him
,
in
manage
his
business
while
he
be
engage
at
the
bottle
,
that
fortune
begin
to
wear
a
kind
aspect
with
regard
to
me
;
and
I
console
myself
for
the
disregard
of
my
former
acquaintance
,
with
the
knowledge
I
daily
imbibe
,
by
a
close
application
to
the
duty
of
my
employment
,
in
which
I
succeed
beyond
my
own
expectation
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
on
very
good
term
with
my
master
's
wife
,
whose
esteem
I
acquire
and
cultivate
,
by
represent
Mrs
Potion
in
the
most
ridiculous
light
my
satirical
talent
could
invent
,
as
well
as
by
render
her
some
christian
office
,
when
she
have
be
too
familiar
with
the
dram
bottle
,
to
which
she
have
often
time
recourse
for
consolation
,
under
the
affliction
<EOS>
she
suffer
from
a
barbarous
husband
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
manner
I
live
,
without
hear
the
least
tiding
of
my
uncle
,
for
the
space
of
two
year
,
during
which
time
I
keep
little
or
no
company
,
be
neither
in
a
humour
to
relish
,
nor
in
a
capacity
to
maintain
much
acquaintance
:
for
the
Nabal
<EOS>
my
master
allow
me
no
wage
;
and
the
small
perquisite
of
my
station
scarce
supply
me
with
the
common
necessary
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
longer
,
a
pert
,
unthinking
coxcomb
,
giddy
with
popular
applause
,
and
elevate
with
the
extravagance
of
hope
;
my
misfortune
have
teach
me
how
little
the
caress
of
the
world
during
a
man
's
prosperity
,
be
to
be
value
by
him
;
and
how
seriously
and
expeditiously
he
ought
to
set
himself
about
make
himself
independent
of
them
.
<EOS>
My
present
appearance
,
therefore
,
be
the
least
of
my
care
,
which
be
wholly
engross
in
lay
up
a
stock
of
instruction
that
may
secure
me
against
the
caprice
of
fortune
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
I
become
such
a
sloven
,
and
contract
such
an
air
of
austerity
,
that
every
body
pronounce
me
crest
-
fall
;
and
Gawky
return
to
town
without
run
any
risk
from
my
resentment
,
which
be
by
this
time
pretty
much
cooled
,
and
restrain
by
prudential
reason
,
so
effectually
,
that
I
never
so
much
as
thought
of
obtain
satisfaction
for
the
injury
he
have
do
me
.
     
<EOS>
when
I
deem
myself
sufficiently
master
of
my
business
,
I
begin
to
cast
about
for
an
opportunity
of
launch
into
the
world
,
in
hope
of
find
some
provision
,
that
may
make
amend
for
the
difficulty
I
have
undergo
:
but
,
as
this
could
not
be
effect
without
a
small
sum
of
money
to
equip
me
for
the
field
,
I
be
in
the
utmost
perplexity
how
to
raise
it
,
<EOS>
well
know
,
that
Crab
,
for
his
own
sake
,
would
never
put
me
in
a
condition
to
leave
him
,
when
his
interest
be
so
much
concerned
in
my
stay
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
small
accident
,
which
happen
about
this
time
,
determine
him
in
my
favour
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
the
pregnancy
of
his
maid
servant
,
who
declare
her
situation
to
me
,
assure
me
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
be
the
occasion
of
it
.
<EOS>
although
I
have
no
reason
to
question
the
truth
of
this
imputation
,
I
be
not
ignorant
of
the
familiarity
which
have
pass
between
her
master
and
her
;
of
which
avail
myself
,
I
represent
to
her
the
folly
of
lay
the
burthen
at
my
door
,
when
she
may
dispose
of
it
to
much
great
advantage
with
Mr
Crab
:
She
listen
to
my
advice
,
and
next
day
acquaint
him
with
the
pretended
success
of
their
mutual
endeavour
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
far
from
be
over
-
joy
at
this
proof
of
his
vigour
,
which
he
foresaw
may
have
very
troublesome
consequence
;
not
that
he
dread
any
domestic
grumbling
and
reproach
from
his
wife
,
whom
he
keep
in
perfect
subjection
;
but
because
he
know
it
would
furnish
his
rival
Potion
with
a
handle
for
insult
and
undermine
his
reputation
,
there
be
no
scandal
equal
to
that
of
uncleanness
,
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
inhabit
that
part
of
the
island
where
he
live
.
     
<EOS>
He
therefore
take
a
resolution
worthy
of
himself
,
which
be
,
to
persuade
the
girl
,
that
she
be
not
with
child
,
but
only
afflict
with
a
disorder
incident
to
young
woman
,
which
he
could
easily
remove
:
with
this
view
(
as
he
pretend
)
<EOS>
he
prescribe
for
her
such
medicine
,
as
he
think
would
infallibly
procure
abortion
;
but
in
this
he
be
disappoint
,
for
the
maid
be
advertise
by
me
of
his
design
,
and
at
the
same
time
well
satisfied
with
her
own
condition
,
absolutely
refuse
to
follow
his
direction
;
and
threaten
to
publish
her
situation
to
the
world
,
if
he
do
not
immediately
take
some
method
of
provide
for
the
important
occasion
,
which
she
expect
in
a
few
month
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
long
before
I
guess
the
result
of
his
deliberation
,
by
his
address
himself
to
me
(
one
day
)
in
this
manner
:
"
I
be
surprised
,
that
a
young
fellow
like
you
,
discover
no
inclination
to
push
his
fortune
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
by
G
-
d
,
before
I
be
of
your
age
,
I
be
broil
on
the
coast
of
Guinea
.
 
<EOS>
Damme
!
<EOS>
what
be
to
hinder
you
from
profit
by
the
war
,
which
will
certainly
be
declare
in
a
short
time
against
Spain
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
easily
get
on
board
of
a
king
's
ship
in
quality
of
a
surgeon
's
mate
,
where
you
will
certainly
see
a
great
deal
of
practice
,
and
stand
a
good
chance
of
get
prize
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
lay
hold
of
this
declaration
,
which
I
have
long
wish
for
,
and
assure
him
I
would
follow
his
advice
with
pleasure
,
if
it
be
in
my
power
;
but
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
,
to
embrace
an
opportunity
of
that
kind
,
have
no
friend
to
advance
a
little
money
,
to
supply
me
with
what
necessary
I
should
want
,
and
defray
the
expence
of
my
journey
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
few
necessary
be
require
;
and
as
for
the
expence
of
my
journey
,
he
would
lend
me
money
,
not
only
for
that
purpose
,
but
also
to
maintain
me
comfortably
in
London
,
until
I
should
procure
a
warrant
for
my
provision
aboard
ship
.
     
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
thousand
thank
for
his
obliging
offer
(
<EOS>
although
I
be
very
well
apprize
of
his
motive
,
which
be
to
make
his
chamber
-
maid
lie
the
child
to
me
after
I
be
go
;
and
accordingly
set
out
in
a
few
week
for
London
;
my
whole
fortune
consist
of
one
suit
of
cloath
,
half
a
dozen
ruffle
shirt
,
as
many
plain
,
two
pair
worst
stocking
,
as
many

;
a
case
of
pocket
instrument
,
a
small
edition
of
Horace
,
Wiseman
's
surgery
,
and
ten
guinea
in
cash
;
for
which
Crab
take
my
bond
,
bear
5
per
cent
interest
;
at
the
same
time
give
me
a
letter
to
the
member
of
parliament
for
our
town
,
which
he
say
would
do
my
business

chapter
viii
<EOS>
I
arrive
at
Newcastle
 
<EOS>
meet
with
my
old
school
-
fellow
Strap
 
<EOS>
we
determine
to
walk
in
company
to
London
 
<EOS>
set
out
on
our
journey
 
put
up
at
a
solitary
ale
-
house
 
be
disturb
by
a
strange
adventure
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
convenience
as
a
waggon
in
this
country
,
and
my
finance
be
too
weak
to
support
the
expence
of
hire
a
horse
;
I
determine
therefore
to
set
out
with
the
carrier
,
who
transport
good
from
one
place
to
another
on
horse
-
back
,
this
I
accordingly
put
in
execution
,
on
the
first
day
of
November
1739
,
sit
upon
a
pack
-
saddle
between
two
basket
;
one
of
which
contain
my
good
in
a
knapsack
.
    
<EOS>
but
by
the
time
we
arrive
at
Newcastle
upon
Tyne
,
I
be
so
fatigued
with
the
tediousness
of
the
carriage
,
and
benumb
with
the
coldness
of
the
weather
,
that
I
resolve
to
travel
the
rest
of
my
journey
on
foot
,
rather
than
proceed
in
such
a
disagreeable
manner
.
    
<EOS>
the
hostler
of
the
inn
at
which
we
put
up
,
<EOS>
understand
I
be
bind
for
London
,
advise
me
to
take
my
passage
in
a
collier
,
which
would
be
both
cheap
and
expeditious
,
and
withal
much
easy
than
to
walk
upwards
of
three
hundred
mile
through
deep
road
,
in
the
winter
time
;
which
he
believe
I
have
not
strength
enough
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
almost
persuade
to
take
his
advice
,
when
,
one
day
,
step
into
a
barber
's
shop
to
be
shave
,
the
young
man
,
while
he
lather
my
face
,
accost
me
thus
:
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
presume
you
be
a
Scotchman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
which
I
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
pray
(
continue
he
)
of
what
part
of
Scotland
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
tell
him
,
than
he
discover
great
emotion
,
and
not
confine
his
operation
to
my
chin
and
upper
lip
,
besmear
my
whole
face
with
great
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
at
which
I
be
so
offended
,
that
start
up
,
I
ask
him
what
the
d
#
#
#
#
<EOS>
I
he
mean
by
use
me
so
?
 
<EOS>
He
beg
pardon
,
tell
me
his
joy
in
meeting
with
a
countryman
,
have
occasion
some
confusion
in
him
;
and
crave
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
declare
my
name
be
Random
he
exclaim
in
a
rapture
,
"
<EOS>
how
!
<EOS>
rory
random
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
same
,
I
reply
,
look
at
him
with
astonishment
;
"
what
,
cry
he
,
do
not
you
know
your
old
school
-
fellow
,
Hugh
Strap
?
"
    
<EOS>
at
that
instant
recollect
his
face
,
I
fly
into
his
arm
,
and
in
the
transport
of
my
joy
,
give
him
back
one
half
of
the
sud
he
have
so
lavishly
bestow
on
my
countenance
;
so
that
we
make
a
very
ludicrous
appearance
,
and
furnish
a
great
deal
of
mirth
to
his
master
and
shop
-
mate
,
who
be
witness
of
this
scene
.
 
<EOS>
when
our
mutual
caress
be
over
,
I
sit
down
again
to
be
shave
,
but
the
poor
fellow
's
nerve
be
so
discompose
by
this
unexpected
meeting
,
that
his
hand
could
scarcely
hold
the
razor
,
with
which
(
nevertheless
)
he
find
mean
to
cut
me
in
three
place
,
in
as
many
stroke
.
<EOS>
His
master
,
perceive
his
disorder
,
bid
another
supply
his
place
;
and
after
the
operation
be
perform
,
give
Strap
leave
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
day
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
retire
immediately
to
my
lodging
,
where
call
for
some
beer
,
I
desire
to
be
inform
of
his
adventure
,
which
contain
nothing
more
,
than
that
his
master
die
before
his
time
be
out
,
he
have
come
to
Newcastle
about
a
year
ago
,
in
expectation
of
journey
-
work
,
along
with
three
young
fellow
of
his
acquaintance
who
work
in
the
keel
;
that
he
have
the
good
fortune
of
be
employ
by
a
very
civil
master
,
with
whom
he
intend
to
stay
till
the
spring
,
at
which
time
he
propose
to
go
to
London
,
where
he
do
not
doubt
of
find
encouragement
.
     
<EOS>
when
I
communicate
to
him
my
situation
and
design
,
he
do
not
approve
of
my
take
a
passage
by
sea
,
by
reason
of
the
danger
of
a
winter
voyage
,
which
be
very
hazardous
along
that
coast
,
as
well
as
the
precariousness
of
the
wind
,
which
may
possibly
detain
me
a
great
while
,
to
the
no
small
detriment
of
my
fortune
:
whereas
,
if
I
would
venture
by
land
,
he
would
bear
me
company
,
carry
my
baggage
as
well
as
his
own
,
all
the
way
;
and
if
we
should
find
ourselves
fatigue
,
it
would
be
no
hard
matter
for
us
to
find
on
the
road
,
either
<EOS>
return
-
horse
or
waggon
,
of
which
we
may
take
the
opportunity
for
a
very
trifling
expence
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
ravish
at
this
proposal
<EOS>
,
that
I
embrace
him
affectionately
,
and
assure
him
he
may
command
my
purse
to
the
last
farthing
;
but
he
give
me
to
understand
,
he
have
save
money
sufficient
to
answer
his
own
occasion
;
and
that
he
have
a
friend
in
London
,
who
would
soon
introduce
him
into
business
,
in
that
capital
;
and
may
possibly
have
it
in
his
power
to
serve
me
likewise
.
    
<EOS>
have
concert
our
plan
and
settle
our
affair
that
night
,
we
depart
next
morning
by
daybreak
,
arm
with
a
good
cudgel
each
,
my
companion
be
charge
with
the
furniture
of
us
both
,
cram
into
one
knapsack
,
which
he
carry
after
the
manner
of
soldier
on
a
march
;
and
our
money
sew
between
the
lining
and
wastband
of
our
breech
,
except
some
loose
silver
for
our
immediate
expence
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
We
travel
all
day
at
a
round
pace
,
but
be
ignorant
of
the
proper
stage
,
we
be
benight
at
a
good
distance
from
any
inn
,
which
compel
us
to
take
up
our
lodging
at
a
small
hedge
ale
-
house
,
that
stand
by
itself
on
a
by
-
road
,
about
half
a
mile
from
the
high
-
way
:
there
we
find
a
pedlar
of
our
own
country
,
in
whose
company
we
regale
ourselves
with
bacon
and
egg
and
a
glass
of
good
ale
,
before
a
comfortable
fire
,
converse
all
the
while
very
sociably
with
the
landlord
and
his
daughter
,
an
hale
buxome
lass
,
who
entertain
us
with
great
good
humour
,
and
in
whose
affection
I
be
vain
enough
to
believe
I
have
make
some
progress
.
     
<EOS>
about
eight
a
clock
,
we
be
all
three
,
at
our
own
desire
,
shew
into
an
apartment
,
where
be
two
bed
,
in
one
of
which
Strap
and
I
betook
ourselves
to
rest
,
and
the
pedlar
occupy
the
other
,
though
not
before
he
have
pray
a
considerable
time
extempore
;
search
into
every
corner
of
the
room
,
and
fasten
the
door
on
the
inside
with
a
strong
iron
screw
,
which
he
carry
about
with
him
for
that
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
sleep
very
sound
till
midnight
,
when
I
be
disturb
by
a
violent
motion
of
the
bed
,
which
shake
under
me
with
a
continual
tremor
.
 
<EOS>
alarm
at
this
phoenomenon
,
I
jog
my
companion
,
whom
to
my
no
small
amazement
,
I
find
drench
in
sweat
,
and
quake
through
every
limb
;
he
tell
me
with
a
low
faultering
voice
,
that
we
be
undo
;
for
there
be
a
bloody
highwayman
load
with
pistol
,
in
the
next
room
;
then
,
bid
me
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
he
direct
me
to
a
small
chink
in
the
board
partition
,
through
which
I
could
see
a
thick
set
brawny
fellow
,
with
a
fierce
countenance
,
sit
at
a
table
in
company
with
our
young
landlady
,
have
a
bottle
of
ale
and
a
brace
of
pistol
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
listen
with
great
attention
,
and
hear
him
say
in
a
terrible
tone
:
"

I

intelligence
to

while
he

"
 
Our
landlady
endeavour
to
appease
this
exasperate
robber
,
by
say
,
that
he
may
possibly
be
mistake
in
Smack
,
who
perhaps
keep
no
correspondence
with
the
other
gentleman
that
rob
his
coach
,
 
and
that
if
an
accident
have
disappoint
him
to
day

he
may
soon
find
opportunity
enough
to
atone
for
his
lost
trouble

"
not

<EOS>
I

such
as

together
with

He
accordingly
run
towards
our
door
;
when
his
sweetheart
interpose
,
assure
him
,
there
be
only
a
couple
of
poor
young
scotchman
,
who
be
too
raw
and
ignorant
to
give
him
the
least
cause
of
suspicion
;
and
the
third
be
a
presbyterian
pedlar
of
the
same
nation
,
who
have
often
lodge
in
the
house
before

this
declaration
satisfy
the
thief

who
swear
he
be
glad
there
be
a
pedlar
there
,
<EOS>
for
he
want
some
linen

<EOS>
then
in
a
jovial
manner
,
he
put
about
the
glass
,
mingle
his
discourse
to
Betty

with
caress
and
familiarity

that
speak
him
very
happy
in
his

during
that
part
of
the
conversation
which
regard
us
,
Strap
have
creep
under
the
bed
,
where
he
lie
without
sense
or
motion
,
so
that
it
be
with
great
difficulty
I
persuade
him
our
danger
be
over
,
and
prevail
on
him
to
wake
the
pedlar
,
and
inform

this
itinerant
merchant
no

feel
somebody
shake
him
by

than
he
start
up
,
call
as
loud
as

Rifle

alarm
at
this
exclamation
,
jump
up
,
cock
one
of
his
pistol
,
and
turn
towards
the
door
to
kill
the
first
man
who
should
enter
;
for
he
verily
believe
himself
beset
;
when
his
Dulcinea
,
after
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
,
persuade
him
,
that
the
poor
pedlar
dreaming
of
thief
,
have
only
cry
out
in
his
sleep
.
     
<EOS>
meanwhile
my
comrade
have
undeceive
our
fellow
-
lodger
,
and
inform
him
of
his
reason
for
disturb
him
;
upon
which
,
get
up
softly
he
peep
through
the
hole
,
and
be
so
terrified
with
what
he
see
,
that
,
fall
down
on
his
bare
knee
,
he
put
up
a
long
petition
to
heaven
,
to
deliver
him
from
the
hand
of
that
ruffian
,
and
promise
never
to
defraud
a
customer
for
the
future
of
the
value
of
a
half

penny
,
provide
he
may
be
rescue
from
his
present
distress
 
whether
or
not
this
disburthene
his
conscience
afford
him
any
ease
,
I
know
not
;
but
he
slipt
into
bed
again
and
lie
very
quiet
until
the
robber
and
his
mistress
be
asleep
,
which
he
understand
by
their
snore
in
concert
;
then
,
rise
softly
,
he
untie
a
rope
that
be
round
his
pack
,
and
<EOS>
make
it
fast
to
one
end
of
it
,
open
the
window
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
and
lower
his
good
into
the
yard
with
great
dexterity
;
which
have
do
,
he
move
gently
to
our
bedside
,
and
bid
us
farewel
,
tell
us
,
that
as
we
run
no
risk
,
we
may
take
our
rest
with
great
confidence
,
and
in
the
morning
assure
the
landlord
that
we
know
nothing
of
his
escape
:
then
shake
us
by
the
hand
,
and
wish
us
all
manner
of
success
,
he
let
himself
drop
from
the
window
without
any
danger
to
the
ground
,
which
be
not
above
one
yard
from
his
foot
as
he
hang
on
the
outside
.
<EOS>
although
I
do
not
think
proper
to
accompany
him
in
his
flight
,
I
be
not
at
all
free
from
apprehension
,
when
I
reflect
on
what
may
be
the
effect
of
the
highwayman
's
disappointment
,
who
certainly
intend
to
make
free
with
the
pedlar
's
ware
.
<EOS>
neither
be
my
companion
at
more
ease
in
his
mind
,
but
on
the
contrary
so
possessed
with
the
dreadful
idea
of
Rifle
,
that
he
solicit
me
strongly
to
follow
our
countryman
's
example
,
and
so
elude
the
fatal
resentment
of
that
terrible
adventurer
,
who
would
certainly
wreak
his
vengeance
on
us
,
as
accomplice
;
of
the
pedlar
's
elopement
.
     
<EOS>
but
I
represent
to
him
,
the
danger
of
give
Rifle
cause
to
think
we
know
his
profession
,
by
put
him
in
mind
,
<EOS>
that
if
ever
he
should
meet
us
again
on
the
road
(
which
far
from
be
impossible
)
he
would
look
upon
us
as
dangerous
acquaintance
,
and
find
it
his
interest
to
put
us
out
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
withal
,
the
confidence
I
have
in
Betty
's
good
-
nature
;
in
which
he
acquiesce
,
and
during
the
remain
part
of
the
night
,
we
concert
a
proper
method
of
behaviour
,
to
render
us
unsuspected
in
the
morning
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
no
sooner
day
,
than
Betty
,
enter
our
chamber
,
and
perceive
the
window
open
,
cry
out
,
"
Ods

<EOS>
sure
you
Scotchmen
must
have
hot
constitution
,
to

all
night
with

open
in
such
cold
weather
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
feign
to
start
out
of
sleep
,
and
withdraw
the
curtain
,
call
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
when
she
shew
me
,
I
affect
surprize
,
and
say
,
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
the
window
be
shut
when
we
go
to

<EOS>

I
will

she
,
if
Sawny
Waddle
<EOS>
the
pedlar
have
not

up
in
a

and
do
it
,
for
I
hear
him
very
obstropulous
in
his
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
sure
I
put
a
chamber

pot
under
his
bed

"
 
<EOS>
with
these
word
she
advance
to
the
bed
in
which
he
lie
,
and
find
the
sheet
cold
,
she
exclaim
,
"

with

not

"
 
<EOS>
then
spring
up
,
I
lay
hold
of
my
breech
,
and
empty
all
my
loose
money
into
my

Heaven

look
to

<EOS>
He
do
so
,
and
find
all
be
right

upon
which
,
we
ask
with
seem

if

have

<EOS>
"
no

no

reply
she
,
he
have
steal
nothing
but
his
reckoning
;
"
which
,
it
seem
,
this
pious
pedlar
have
forget
to
discharge
in
the
midst
of
his
devotion
:
<EOS>
Betty
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
withdraw
,
and
immediately
we
could
hear
her
waken
Rifle
,
who
no
sooner
hear
of
Waddle
's
flight
,
than
he
jump
out
of
bed
and
dress
,
vent
a
thousand
execration
,
and
vow
to
murder
the
pedlar
if
ever
he
could
set
eye
on
him
again
;
"
for
,
say
he
,
the
scoundrel
have
by
this
time
raise
the
hue
and
cry
against
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
have
dress
himself
in
a
hurry
,
he
mount
his
horse
,
and
for
that
time
rid
us
of
his
company
and
a
thousand
fear
that
be
the
consequence
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
at
breakfast
,
Betty
endeavour
by
all
the
cunning
she
be
mistress
of
,
to
learn
whether
or
no
we
suspect
our
fellow
-
lodger
,
whom
we
see
take
horse
;
but
as
we
be
on
our
guard
,
we
answer
her
sly
question
with
a
simplicity
she
could
not
distrust
;
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
we
hear
the
trampling
of
a
horse
's
foot
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
this
noise
alarm
Strap
so
much
,
whose
imagination
be
wholly
engross
by
the
image
of
Rifle
,
<EOS>
that
with
a
countenance
as
pale
as
milk
,
he
cry
out
,
"
o
Lord
!
<EOS>
there
be
the
highwayman
return
!
"
 
<EOS>
Our
landlady
startle
at
these
word
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
what
highwayman
,
young
man
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
any
highwayman
harbour
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
though
I
be
very
much
disconcert
at
this
piece
of
indiscretion
in
Strap
,
I
have
presence
of
mind
enough
to
tell
her
,
we
have
meet
a
horse
-
man
the
day
before
,
whom
Strap
have
foolishly
suppose
to
be
a
highwayman
,
because
he
ride
with
pistol
;
and
that
he
be
terrify
at
the
sound
of
a
horse
's
foot
ever
since
.
     
<EOS>
She
force
a
smile
at
the
ignorance
and
timorousness
of
my
comrade
;
but
I
could
perceive
,
(
not
without
great
concern
)
that
this
account
be
not
at
all
satisfactory
to
her
.

chapter
IX
<EOS>
We
proceed
on
our
journey
 
be
overtake
by
an
highwayman
who
fire
at
Strap
,
be
prevent
from
shoot
me
by
a
company
of
horseman
,
who
ride
in
pursuit
of
him
 
<EOS>
Strap
be
put
to
bed
at
an
inn
.
 
<EOS>
adventure
at
that
inn
.
  
<EOS>
after
have
pay
our
score
,
and
take
leave
of
our
hostess
,
who
embrace
me
tenderly
at
parting
,
we
proceed
on
our
journey
,
bless
our
self
that
we
have
come
off
so
well
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
walk
above
five
mile
,
when
we
observe
a
man
on
horse
-
back
galloping
after
us
,
whom
we
in
a
short
time
recognize
to
be
no
other
than
this
formidable
hero
who
have
already
give
us
so
much
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
hard
by
me
,
and
ask
if
I
know
who
he
be
?
 
<EOS>
My
astonishment
have
disconcert
me
so
much
,
that
I
do
not
hear
his
question
,
which
he
repeat
with
a
volley
of
oath
and
threat
;
but
I
remain
as
mute
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
strap
see
my
discomposure
,
fall
upon
his
knee
in
the
mud
,
utter
with
a
lamentable
voice
,
these
word
:
"
for
Ch####st
's
sake
,
have
mercy
upon
us
,
Mr
Rifle
<EOS>
,
we
know
you
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
ho
!
<EOS>
cry
the
thief
,
you
do
!
 
<EOS>
but
by
g
-
d
,
you
never
shall
be
evidence
against
me
in
this
world
<EOS>
,
you
dog
!
"
     
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
draw
a
pistol
,
and
fire
it
at
the
unfortunate
shaver
,
who
fall
flat
upon
the
ground
without
speak
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
My
comrade
's
fate
,
and
my
own
situation
,
rivette
me
to
the
place
where
I
stand
,
deprive
of
all
sense
and
reflection
;
so
that
I
do
not
make
the
least
attempt
either
to
run
away
,
or
deprecate
the
wrath
of
this
barbarian
,
who
snap
a
second
pistol
at
me
;
but
before
he
have
time
to
prime
again
,
perceive
a
company
of
horse
-
man
come
up
<EOS>
;
whereupon
he
ride
off
,
and
leave
me
stand
motionless
as
a
statue
,
in
which
posture
<EOS>
I
be
find
by
those
whose
appearance
have
save
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
this
company
,
which
consist
of
three
man
in
livery
,
well
armed
,
be
head
by
an
officer
,
who
(
as
I
afterwards
learn
)
be
the
person
from
whom
Rifle
have
take
the
pocket
pistol
the
day
before
;
and
who
,
make
know
his
misfortune
to
a
nobleman
he
meet
on
the
road
,
assure
him
,
his
non
-
resistance
be
altogether
owe
to
his
consideration
for
the
lady
in
the
coach
,
procure
the
assistance
of
his
lordship
's
servant
to
go
in
quest
of
the
plunderer
.
 
<EOS>
this
holiday
captain
scamper
up
to
me
with
great
address
,
and
ask
who
fire
the
pistol
which
he
have
hear
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
not
yet
recover
my
reason
,
he
,
before
I
could
answer
,
observe
a
body
lie
on
the
ground
:
at
which
sight
,
his
colour
vanish
,
and
he
pronounce
with
a
faultere
tongue
,
<EOS>
"
gentleman
,
here
be
murder
commit
!
<EOS>
let
us
alight
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
say
one
of
his
follower
,
let
us
rather
pursue
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
which
way
go
he
,
young
man
?
"
     
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
I
have
recollect
myself
so
far
as
to
tell
them
<EOS>
he
could
not
be
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
them
;
and
beg
one
of
them
to
assist
me
in
convey
the
corp
of
my
friend
to
the
next
house
,
in
order
to
its
be
inter
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
foreseeing
that
in
case
he
pursue
,
he
must
soon
come
to
action
,
begin
to
curb
his
horse
,
and
give
him
the
spur
at
the
same
time
,
which
make
the
creature
rear
up
and
snort
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
call
out
,
his
horse
be
frightened
and
would
not
proceed
;
at
the
same
time
wheel
him
round
and
round
,
stroake
his
neck
,
whistle
and
wheedle
him
with
"
Sirrah
,
sirrah
 
gently
,
gently

<EOS>
(
cry
one
of
the
servant
)
<EOS>
sure
my
Lord
's
Sorrel
be
not
resty
!
"
 
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
he
bestow
a
lash
on
his
buttock
,
and
Sorrel
disdain
the
rein
,
spring
forward
with
the
captain
at
a
pace
that
would
have
soon
bring
him
up
with
the
robber
,
have
not
the
girth
(
happily
for
him
)
give
way
,
by
which
mean
he
land
in
the
dirt
;
and
two
of
his
attendant
continue
their
pursuit
,
without
mind
his
situation
in
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
one
of
the
three
who
remain
at
my
desire
,
turn
the
Body
of
Strap
to
one
side
,
in
order
to
see
the
wound
which
have
kill
him
,
find
him
still
warm
and
breathe
;
whereupon
I
immediately
let
him
blood
,
and
see
him
,
with
inexpressible
joy
,
recover
;
have
receive
no
other
wound
than
what
his
fear
inflict
.
 
<EOS>
have
get
him
upon
his
leg
,
we
walk
together
to
an
inn
,
about
half
a
mile
from
the
place
,
where
Strap
be
not
quite
recover
,
go
to
bed
;
and
in
a
little
time
after
,
the
third
servant
return
with
the
captain
's
horse
and
furniture
,
leave
himself
to
crawl
after
as
well
as
he
could
.
    
<EOS>
this
Gentleman
of
the
sword
upon
his
arrival
,
complain
grievously
of
the
bruise
occasion
by
his
fall
;
and
on
the
recommendation
of
the
servant
,
who
warrant
my
ability
,
I
be
employ
to
bleed
him
,
for
which
he
reward
me
with
half
a
crown
.
    
<EOS>
the
time
between
this
and
dinner
,
I
pass
in
observe
a
game
at
card
,
between
two
farmer
,
an
exciseman
,
and
a
young
fellow
in
a
rusty
gown
and
cassock
,
who
,
as
I
afterwards
understand
,
be
curate
of
a
neighbour
parish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
perceive
that
the
match
be
not
equal
;
the
two
farmer
be
partner
,
have
to
do
with
a
couple
of
sharper
,
who
stript
them
of
all
their
cash
in
a
very
short
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
surprise
me
very
much
,
be
to
hear
this
clergyman
reply
to
one
of
the
countryman
who
seem
to
suspect
foul
play
,
in
these
word
:
"
D####n
me
,
friend
,
<EOS>
d'ye
question
my
honour
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
at
all
wonder
to
find
a
cheat
in
canonical
,
<EOS>
this
be
an
animal
frequent
in
my
own
country
;
but
I
be
scandalize
at
the
indecency
of
his
behaviour
,
which
appear
in
the
oath
he
swear
,
and
the
baudy
song
which
he
sing
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
to
make
amend
,
in
some
sort
,
for
the
damage
he
have
do
the
unwary
boor
,
he
pull
out
a
fiddle
from
the
lining
of
his
gown
,
and
promise
to
treat
them
with
a
dinner

<EOS>
We

You
must

He
pick
up
some
scrap
of
learning
while
he
serve
young

Trifle
at
the

but
what
he
most
excell
in

be

no

know
his

better

I

for
I

He
get
himself
into
a

by

some
of
his

be
turn
away

as
he
be
acquaint

some
particular
circumstance
of
my

he
do
not

to
exasperate
him

so
make
interest

order

afterwards
recommend
him
to
the

enjoy

the

can
not

You

be
really
divert
company

this
make
him
agreeable

as
for
play
at
card

there
be
not
a

within
three
county
a
match
for
him

<EOS>
the
truth
be

he
be
a

can
shift

such

it
be
impossible

at
this
he

ask

why

have
not
justice
enough
to
acquaint

before

the
exciseman
reply
without
any
hesitation
,
that
it
be
none
of
his
business
to
intermeddle
between
man

besides
,
he
do
not

they
be
ignorant
of

be
notorious
to

this
do
not

him

insist
on
have
his

which
the

as
positively
refuse

affirm

that
whatever
slight

he
be
very
certain

that
he
have
play'd
<EOS>
on
the
square
with
them

would
answer
it
before
any
bench

so
say
,
he
get
up
,
and
have
pay
his

sneak
off

<EOS>
the
landlord
thrust
his

into

to

if

shake

where

go
to

in
the
night

be
awake
by
a
dreadful
adventure
 
<EOS>
next
night
we
lodge
at
the
house
of
a
school

master
 
our
treatment
there
.
  
<EOS>
strap
and
I
be
about
to
depart
on
our
journey
,
when
we
perceive
a
croud
on
the
road
,
come
towards
us
,
shout
and
hollow
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
as
it
approach
,
we
could
discern
a
man
on
horse
-
back
in
the
middle
,
with
his
hand
tie
behind
him
,
whom
we
soon
know
to
be
Rifle
.
 
<EOS>
this
highwayman
not
be
so
well
mount
as
the
two
servant
who
go
in
pursuit
of
him
,
be
soon
overtake
,
and
after
have
discharge
his
pistol
,
make
prisoner
without
any
further
opposition
.
<EOS>
They
be
carry
him
in
triumph
,
amidst
the
acclamation
of
the
country
people
,
to
a
justice
of
peace
in
a
neighbouring
village
,
but
stopt
at
our
inn
to
join
their
companion
and
take
refreshment
.
    
<EOS>
when
Rifle
be
dismount
,
and
place
in
the
yard
,
within
a
circle
of
peasant
arm
with
pitch
-
fork
,
I
be
amazed
to
see
what
a
pitiful
deject
fellow
he
now
appear
,
who
have
but
a
few
hour
ago
,
fill
me
with
so
much
terror
and
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
My
companion
be
so
much
encourage
by
this
alteration
in
his
appearance
,
that
go
up
to
the
thief
,
he
present
his
clenched
fist
to
his
nose
,
and
declare
,
that
he
would
either
cudgel
or
box
with
the
prisoner
for
a
guinea
,
which
he
immediately
produce
;
and
begin
to
strip
 
but
be
dissuade
from
this
adventure
by
me
,
who
represent
to
him
the
folly
of
the
undertaking
,
as
Rifle
be
now
in
the
hand
of
justice
,
which
would
,
no
doubt
,
give
us
all
satisfaction
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
make
me
repent
of
our
impertinent
curiosity
<EOS>
,
be
our
be
detain
by
the
captor
,
as
evidence
against
him
,
when
we
be
just
go
to
set
forward
.
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
remedy
;
we
be
oblige
to
comply
,
and
accordingly
join
in
the
cavalcade
,
which
luckily
take
the
same
road
that
we
propose
.
 
<EOS>
about
the
twilight
we
arrive
at
the
place
of
our
destination
,
but
as
the
justice
be
go
to
visit
a
gentleman
in
the
country
,
with
whom
he
would
probably
stay
all
night
,
the
robber
be
confine
in
an
empty
garret
three
story
high
,
from
which
it
seem
impossible
for
him
to
escape
:
this
,
nevertheless
,
be
the
case
;
for
next
morning
,
when
they
go
up
stair
,
to
bring
him
before
the
justice
,
the
bird
be
fly
,
have
get
out
at
the
window
upon
the
lead
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
continue
his
rout
along
the
top
of
the
adjoining
house
,
and
get
into
another
garret
window
,
where
he
sculke
,
until
the
family
be
asleep
,
at
which
time
he
venture
down
stair
,
and
let
himself
out
by
the
street
door
,
which
be
find
open
.
<EOS>
this
event
be
a
great
disappointment
to
those
that
apprehend
him
,
who
be
flush
with
hope
of
the
reward
;
but
give
me
great
joy
,
as
I
be
permit
now
to
continue
my
journey
without
any
further
molestation

<EOS>
Resolving
to
make
up
for
the
small
progress
we
have
hitherto
make

we
this
day
travel
with
great
vigour
,
and
before
night
get
to
a
market
-
town
twenty
mile
from
the
place
from
whence
we
set
out
in
the
morning

any
adventure
worth
notice

here
have
take
up
our
lodging
at
an
inn

I
find
myself
so
fatigued

that
I
begin
to
despair
of
perform
our
journey
on
foot
,
and
desire
Strap
to
enquire
if
there
be
any
waggon

return
-
horse

or
other
cheap
carriage
in
this
place

to
depart
for

He
be
inform
,
that
the
waggon
from
Newcastle
for
London
have
halt
here
two
night
ago

and
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
overtake
it
,
if
not
the
next
day
,
at
farth
the
day
after
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
this
piece
of
news
give
us
some
satisfaction

<EOS>
though

could
have
very
well
dispense
with

,
we
be
glad
to
submit
to
this
disposition
,
as
there
be
not
another

empty
in
the
house
;
and
accordingly
go
to
rest
,
after
have
secure
our
baggage
under
the
bolster

<EOS>
about
two
or
three
a

clock
in
the
morning

I
be
wake
out
of
a
very
profound
sleep

by
a
dreadful
noise
in
the

do
not

to
throw
me
into
an

of
consternation

enter
a
small
village
in
the
twilight
.
<EOS>
We
enquire
for
a
publick
house
,
and
be
direct
to
one
of
a
very
sorry
appearance
.
<EOS>
at
our
entrance
the
landlord
,
who
seem
to
be
a
venerable
old
man
,
with
long
grey
hair
,
rise
from
a
table
place
by
a
large
fire
in
a
very
neat
pave
kitchin
,
and
with
a
chearful
countenance
accost
us
in
these
word
:
"
Salvete
Pueri
 
ingredimini
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
little
pleased
to
hear
our
host
speak
Latin
,
because
I
be
in
hope
of
recommend
myself
to
him
by
my
knowledge
in
that
language
;
I
therefore
answer
without
hesitation
,
 
dissolve
frigus
,
ligna
super
foco
.
 
<EOS>
large
reponen
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
pronounce
these
word
,
than
the
old
gentleman
run
towards
me
,
shake
me
by
the
hand
,
crying
,
"
 
Fili
mi
dilectissime
!
<EOS>
unde
venis
!
 
<EOS>
a

,
ni
fallor

"
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
find
we
be
both
read
in
the
classick
,
he
do
not
know
how
to
testify
his
regard
,
but
order
his
daughter
,
a
jolly
rosy
-
cheek
damsel
,
who
be
his
sole
domestic
,
to
bring
us
a
bottle
of
his
quadrimum
.
 
<EOS>
repeat
from
Horace
at
the
same
time
,
"
deprome
quadrimum
sabin
‚
,
o
Thaliarche
,
merum
diot

.
<EOS>
"
this
quadrimum
be
excellent
ale
of
his
own
brewing
,
of
which
he
tell
us
he
have
always
an
amphora
four
year
old
,
for
the
use
of
himself
and
friend
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
which
be
interlard
with
scrap
of
Latin
,
we
understand
that
this
facetious
person
be
a
school
-
master
,
whose
income
be
small
,
he
be
fain
to
keep
a
glass
of
good
liquor
for
the
entertainment
of
passenger
,
by
which
he
make
shift
to
make
the
two
end
of
the
year
meet
.
     
<EOS>
"
I
be
this
day
,
say
he
,
the
happiest
old
fellow
in
his
majesty
's
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
My
wife

rest
her
soul
,
be
in
heaven

<EOS>
My
daughter
be
to
be
marry
next
week
;
 
but
the
two
chief
pleasure
of
my
life
be
these
(
point
to
the
bottle
and
a
large
edition
of
Horace
that
lie
one
the
table

<EOS>
I
be
old
,
'
tis
true

<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
the
more
reason
I
should
enjoy
the
small
share
of
life
that
remain
,
as
my
friend
Flaccus
advise
:
  
<EOS>
Tu

<EOS>
"
 
as
he
be
very
inquisitive
about
our
affair
,
we
make
no
scruple
of
acquaint
him
with
our
situation
,
which
when
he
have
learn
,
he
enrich
us
with
advice
how
to
behave
in
the
world
,
tell
us
that
he
be
no
stranger
to
the
deceit
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
he
order
his
daughter
to
lay
a
fowl
to
the
fire
for
supper
,
for
he
be
resolve
this
night
to
regale
his
friend
 
permittens
divis

<EOS>
while
our
entertainment
be
prepare
,
our
host
recount
the
adventure
of
his
own
life
,
which
,
as
they
contain
nothing
remarkable
,
I
forbear
to
rehearse
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
fare
sumptuously
and
drink
several
bottle
of
his
quadrimum
,
I
express
a
desire
of
go
to
rest
,
which
be
with
some
difficulty
comply
with
,
after
he
have
inform
us
that
we
should
overtake
the
waggon
by
noon
next
day
;
and
that
there
be
room
enough
in
it
for
half
a
dozen
,
there
be
only
four
passenger
as
yet
in
that
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
before
my
comrade
<EOS>
and
I
fall
asleep
<EOS>
we
have
some
conversation
about
the
good
humour
of
our
landlord
,
which
give
Strap
such
an
idea
of
his
benevolence
,
that
he
be
positive
we
should
pay
nothing
for
our
lodging
and
entertainment
.
     
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
observe

say
he
,
that
he
have
conceive
a
particular
affection

<EOS>
nay

treat
us

"
 
<EOS>
I
be
partly
of
Strap

opinion
;

the
experience
I
have
of
the
world
make
me
suspend
my
belief

to

My

could
not

easily
put
up

either
take

third

chapter
XI
We
descry
the
waggon
 
get
into
it
 
arrive
at
an
inn
 
<EOS>
our
fellow
traveller
describe
 
a
mistake
be
commit
by
Strap
,
which
produce
strange
thing
.
  
<EOS>
We
travel
half
a
mile
without
exchange
one
word
;
my
thought
be
engross
by
the
knavery
of
the
world
,
to
which
I
must
be
daily
expose
;
and
the
contemplation
of
my
finance
,
which
begin
sensibly
to
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
Strap
,
who
could
hold
no
longer
,
address
me
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
fool
and
their
money
be
soon
part
.
 
<EOS>
if
my
advice
have
be
take
,
that
old
skin
-
flint
should
have
be
damn'd
before
he
have
get
more
than
the
third
of
his
demand
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
sure
sign
you
come
easily
by
your
money
,
when
you
squander
it
away
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
God
help
you
,
how
many
brisly
beard
must
I
have
mow
before
I
earn
4
shilling
and
three
penny
halfpenny
,
which
be
all
throw
to
the
dog
?
 
<EOS>
how
many
day
have
I
sit
weave
hair
,
till
my
toe
be
numb
by
the
cold
,
my
finger
cramp'd
,
and
my
nose
as
blue
as
the
sign
of
the
periwig
that
hang
over
the
door
?
 
<EOS>
what
the
devil
be
you
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
engage
to
box
with
any
one
of
those
fellow
who
come
in
,
for
a
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
beat
stouter
man
than
either
of
them
.
"
     
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
my
companion
would
have
fight
any
body
,
when
his
life
be
in
no
danger
;
but
he
have
a
mortal
aversion
to
fire
arm
and
all
instrument
of
death
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
appease
him
,
I
assure
him
,
no
part
of
this
extraordinary
expence
should
fall
upon
his
shoulder
;
at
which
he
be
affront
,
and
tell
me
,
he
would
have
me
to
know
,
that
although
he
be
a
poor
barber
's
boy
,
he
have
a
soul
to
spend
his
money
with
the
good
"
squire
of
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
have
walk
all
day
at
a
great
pace
,
without
halt
for
a
refreshment
,
we
descry
towards
the
evening
,
to
our
inexpressible
joy
,
the
waggon
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
us
;
and
by
that
time
we
come
up
with
it
,
be
both
of
us
<EOS>
so
weary
,
that
I
verily
believe
it
would
have
be
impracticable
for
us
to
have
walk
one
mile
further
.
 
<EOS>
We
therefore
bargain
with
the
driver
,
whose
name
be
Joey
,
to
give
us
a
cast
to
the
next
stage
for
a
shilling
;
at
which
place
we
would
meet
the
master
of
the
waggon
,
with
whom
we
may
agree
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
the
convenience
stopt
,
and
Joey
have
place
the
ladder
,
Strap
(
be
load
with
our
baggage
)
mount
first
;
but
just
as
he
be
get
in
,
a
tremendous
voice
assail
his
ear
in
these
word
:
"
God
's
fury
!
<EOS>
there
shall
no
passenger
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
poor
shaver
be
so
disconcert
at
this
exclamation
,
which
both
he
and
I
imagine
proceed
from
the
mouth
of
a
giant
,
that
he
descend
with
great
velocity
,
and
a
countenance
as
white
as
paper
.
 
<EOS>
Joey
perceive
our
astonishment
,
call
with
an
arch
sneer
,
"
waund
,

<EOS>

<EOS>
this
be
not
encouragement
sufficient
to
Strap
,
who
could
not
be
prevail
upon
to
venture
up
again
;
upon
which
I
attempt
,
though
not
without
a
quake
heart
,
when
I
hear
the
same
voice
muttering
like
distant
thunder
:

<EOS>
however
I
creep
in
,
and
by
accident
get
an
empty
place
in
the
straw
,
which
I
immediately
take
possession
of
,
without
be
able
to
discern
the
face
of

fellow

traveller

the
dark

follow
with
the
knapsack

chance
to
take
the
other
side

and
by
a
jolt
of
the
carriage
,
pitch
directly
upon
the
stomach
of
the
captain
,
who
bellow
out
in
a
most
dreadful
manner
:
"

thunder

<EOS>
where

"
 
<EOS>
at
these
word
,
my
fright
comrade
start
up
,
and
at
one
spring
,
bounce
against
me
with
such
force
,
that
I
think
the
suppose
son
of
Anak
intend
to
smother
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
a
female
voice
cry
out
,
"
bless
me

<EOS>
what

the
matter

my

the
matter

the
captain

Scotchman

hump

tremble
all
the
while
at
my
back
,
ask
him
pardon
,
and
lay
the
blame
of
what
have
happen
upon
the
jolting
of
the
waggon
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
who
speak
before
,
go
on
:
"
<EOS>
ay

ay

my
dear
,
it
be
our
own
fault

thank

I
thank
God

never
travel
so
before

I
be
sure
if
my
lady
or
Sir
John
be
to
know
where
we
be

they
would
not
sleep
this
night
for
vexation

<EOS>
this
discourse
give
me
such
a
high
notion
of
the
captain
and
his
lady
,
that
I
durst
not
venture
to
join
in
the
conversation
;
but
immediately
after
,
another
female
voice
begin
:
"

these

accompany
with
a
hearty
smack

enliven
the
person
to
whom
they
be

,
to
such
a

that
he
cry
in
transport

with
a
quavering
voice
,
"
ah

you
wanton

upon

"
 
<EOS>
this
laugh
introduce
a
fit
of
coughing
,
which
almost
suffocate
the
poor
usurer
(
such
,
we
afterwards
sound
,
be
the
profession
of
this
our
fellow
-
traveller
.
)
 
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
I
fall
asleep
,
and
enjoy
a
comfortable
nap
till
such
time
as
we
arrive
at
the
inn
where
we
put
up
.
     
<EOS>
here
,
have
get
out
of
the
waggon
first
,
I
have
an
opportunity
of
view
the
passenger
in
order
as
they
enter
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
who
appear
be
a
brisk
airy
girl
,
about
twenty
year
old
,
with
a
silver
-
laced
hat
on
her
head
,
instead
of
a
cap
,
a
blue
stuff
riding
suit
trim
with
silver
,
very
much
tarnished
,
and
a
whip
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
after
her
,
come
limp
,
an
old
man
with
a
worst
night
-
cap
,
button
under
his
chin
,
and
a
broad
brim
hat
slouch
over
it
,
an
old
rusty
blue
cloak
tie
about
his
neck
,
under
which
appear
a
brown
surtout
,
that
cover
a
threadbare
coat
and
waste
-
coat
,
and
,
as
we
afterward
,
discern
,
a
dirty
flannel
jacket
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
be
hollow
,
bleared
and
gummy
;
his
face
be
shrivel
into
a
thousand
wrinkle
,
his
gum
be
destitute
of
tooth
,
his
nose
sharp
and
drooping
,
his
chin
peek
and
prominent
,
so
that
when
he
mumpe
or
speak
,
they
approach
one
another
like
a
pair
of
nut
-
cracker
;
he
support
himself
on
an
ivory
-
head
cane
,
and
his
whole
figure
be
a
just
emblem
of
winter
,
famine
and
avarice
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
be
I
surprize
,
when
I
beheld
the
formidable
captain
lead
in
his
wife
;
in
the
shape
of
a
little
,
thin
creature
,
about
the
age
of
forty
,
with
a
long
,
withered
visage
,
very
much
resemble
that
of
a
baboon
,
through
the
upper
part
of
which
,
two
little
grey
eye
peep
:
He
wear
his
own
hair
in
a
queue
that
reach
to
his
rump
,
which
immoderate
length
,
I
suppose
,
be
the
occasion
of
a
baldness
that
appear
on
the
crown
of
his
head
,
when
he
deign
to
take
off
his
hat
,
which
be
very
much
of
the
size
and
cock
of
Pistol
's
.
 
<EOS>
have
lay
aside
his
great
coat
,
I
could
not
help
admire
the
extraordinary
make
of
this
man
of
war
:
    
<EOS>
He
be
about
five
foot
and
three
inch
high
,
<EOS>
sixteen
inch
of
which
go
to
his
face
and
long
scraggy
neck
;
his
thigh
be
about
six
inch
in
length
,
his
leg
resemble
spindle
or
drum
-
stick
,
two
foot
and
an
half
,
and
his
body
,
which
put
me
in
mind
of
extension
without
substance
,
engross
the
remainder
;
 
so
that
on
the
whole
,
he
appear
like
a
spider
or
grashopper
erect
,
 
and
be
almost
a
vox
&
preterea
nihil
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
consist
in
a
frock
of
what
be
call
bear
-
skin
,
the
skirt
of
which
be
about
half
a
foot
long
,
an
Hussar
waistcoat
,
scarlet
breech
reach
half
way
down
his
thigh
,
worst
stocking
roll
up
almost
to
his
groin
,
and
shoe
with
wooden
heel
<EOS>
at
least
two
inch
high
;
he
carry
a
sword
very
near
as
long
as
himself
in
one
hand
,
and
in
the
other
conduct
his
lady
,
who
seem
to
be
a
woman
of
his
own
age
,
and
still
retain
some
remain
of
an
agreeable
person
;
but
so
ridiculously
affect
,
that
have
I
then
know
as
much
of
the
world
as
I
do
now
,
I
may
have
easily
perceive
in
her
,
the
deplorable
vanity
and
second
-
hand
air
of
a
lady
's
woman
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
assemble
in
the
kitchen
,
when
captain
Weazel
(
for
that
be
his
name
)
desire
a
room
with
a
fire
for
himself
and
spouse
;
and
tell
the
landlord
,
they
would
sup
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
inn
-
keeper
reply
,
that
he
could
not
afford
them
a
room
by
themselves
;
and
as
for
supping
,
he
have
prepare
victual
for
the
passenger
in
the
waggon
without
respect
of
person
,
but
if
he
could
prevail
on
the
rest
to
let
him
have
his
choice
in
a
separate
manner
,
with
all
his
heart
:
    
<EOS>
this
be
no
sooner
say
,
than
all
of
us
declare
against
the
proposal
,
and
miss
Jenny
(
our
other
female
passenger
)
observe
,
that
if
captain
Weazel
and
his
lady
have
a
mind
to
sup
by
themselves
,
they
may
wait
until
we
should
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
,
the
captain
put
on
a
martial
frown
and
look
very
big
,
without
speak
;
while
his
yoke
-
fellow
,
with
a
disdainful
toss
of
her
nose
,
mutter
something
about
"
creature
;
"
 
which
miss
Jenny
over
-
hearing
,
stept
up
to
her
,
say
,
"

,
 
<EOS>
I
will
assure
you

<EOS>
no
such
creature
as
you
neither
 
no
ten

no

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
here
the
captain
interpose
with
a
"
Damme
,
madam
,
<EOS>
what
d'ye
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
damn

<EOS>
(
reply
miss

)
<EOS>
who
make
you
a

,
you
pitiful

trencher

curler

<EOS>
"
Sdeath

<EOS>
the

(
cry
Weazel
)
<EOS>
d'ye
question

<EOS>
hell

fury
and
destruction
!
<EOS>
I
would
have
his
liver
for
my
supper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
draw
his
sword
,
and
flourish
with
it
,
to
the
great
terror
of
Strap
:
while
miss
Jenny
snap
her
finger
,
tell
him
,
she
do
not
value
his
resentment
a
f####t
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
quarrel
,
the
master
of
the
waggon
alight
,
who
understand
the
cause
of
it
,
and
fear
the
captain
and
his
lady
would
take
so
much
umbrage
,
as
to
leave
his
carriage
,
be
at
great
pain
to
have
every
thing
make
up
,
which
he
at
last
accomplished
,
and
we
sit
down
to
supper
all
together
.
    
<EOS>
at
bedtime
time
we
be
shew
to
our
apartment
.
<EOS>
the
old
usurer
,
Strap
and
I
,
be
conduct
to
one
room
;
the
captain
,
his
wife
,
and
miss
Jenny
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
about
midnight
,
my
companion
's
bowel
be
disorder
,
he
get
up
,
in
order
to
go
backward
;
in
his
return
,
mistake
one
door
for
another
,
he
enter
Weazel
's
chamber
,
and
without
any
hesitation
go
to
bed
to
his
wife
,
who
be
fast
asleep
;
the
captain
be
at
another
end
of
the
room
,
grope
for
some
empty
vessel
,
his
own
chamber
-
pot
be
leaky
:
as
he
do
not
perceive
Strap
come
in
,
he
go
toward
his
own
bed
,
after
have
find
a
convenience
;
but
no
sooner
do
he
feel
a
rough
head
with
a
cotton
night
-
cap
on
it
,
than
it
come
into
his
mind
,
that
he
be
get
to
miss
Jenny
's
bed
instead
of
his
own
,
and
that
the
head
he
feel
,
be
that
of
some
gallant
,
with
whom
she
have
make
an
assignation
.
 
<EOS>
full
of
this
conjecture
,
and
scandalize
at
the
prostitution
of
his
apartment
,
he
snatch
up
the
vessel
he
have
just
before
fill
,
and
empty
it
at
once
on
the
astonished
barber
and
his
own
wife
,
who
wake
at
that
instant
,
break
forth
into
lamentable
cry
,
which
not
only
alarm
the
husband
beyond
measure
,
but
frighten
poor
Strap
almost
out
of
his
sense
;
for
he
verily
believe
himself
bewitch
;
especially
when
the
incense
captain
seize
him
by
the
throat
,
with
a
volley
of
oath
,
ask
him
how
he
durst
have
the
presumption
to
attempt
the
chastity
of
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Strap
be
so
amazed
and
confound
,
that
he
could
say
nothing
,
but
,
 
"
I
take
God
to
witness
she
be
a
virgin
for
me
.
"
     
<EOS>
Mrs
Weazel
enrage
to
find
herself
in
such
a
pickle
,
through
the
precipitation
of
her
husband
,
get
up
in
her
shift
,
and
with
the
heel
of
her
shoe
,
which
she
find
at
the
bed

side
,
belabour
the
captain

"

"
 
<EOS>
the
noise
occasion
by
this
adventure
,
have
bring
the
master
of
the
waggon
and
me
to
the
door
,
where
we
overhear
all
that
pass
,
with
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
in

we
be
alarm
with
the
cry

with
great

"
 
<EOS>
some
servant
of
the
inn
hear
this
cry
,
come
run
up
stair
with
light
,
and
such
weapon
as
chance
afford
;
when
we
beheld
a
very
diverting
scene
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
corner
stand
the
poor
captain
shiver
in
his
shirt
,
which
be
all
tear
to
rag
;
with
a
woful
visage
,
scratch
all
over
by
his
wife
,
who
have
by
this
time
wrapt
the
covering
about
her
,
and
sit
cry
on
the
side
of
her
bed
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
other
end
,
lie
the
old
usurer
sprawling
on
miss
Jenny
's
bed
,
with
nothing
on
him
but
his
flannel
jacket
over
his
shirt
,
and
his
tawny
meagre
limb
expose
to
the
air
;
while
she
hold
him
fast
by
the
two
ear
,
and
load
him
with
execration
.
     
<EOS>
when
we
ask
what
be
the
matter
,
she
affect
to
weep
,
and
tell
us
,
she
be
afraid
that
wicked
rogue
have
ruin
her
in
her
sleep
,
and
bid
us
take
notice
of
what
we
see
,
for
she
intend
to
make
use
of
our
evidence
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
wretch
look
like
one
more
dead
than
alive
,
and
beg
for
Christ
's
sake
to
be
release
;
which
be
no
sooner
do
,
than
he
protest
she
be
no
woman
,
but
a
devil
incarnate
 
that
she
have
first
seduce
his
flesh
to
rebel
,
and
then
betray
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
cockatrice
(
continue
he
,
with
a
faultere
voice
)
<EOS>
thou
knowest
thou
did'st
spread
this
snare
for
me
 
but
thou
shalt
not
succeed
 
for
I
will
hang
myself
before
thou
shalt
get
a
farthing
of
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
crawl
to
his
own
bed
,
groan
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
advance
to
the
captain
,
who
tell
us
,
"
gentleman
,
here
have
be
a
damn'd
mistake
;
but
I
will
be
revenge
on
him
who
be
the
occasion
of
it

<EOS>
that
Scotchman
who
carry
the
knapsack
shall
not
breathe
this
vital
air
another
day
,
if
my
name
be
Weazel

<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
ask
you
ten
thousand
pardon
;
you
be
sensible
I
could
mean
no
harm
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
you
mean
(
reply
she
,
sob
)
<EOS>
but
I
know
I
have
get
enough
to
send
me
to
my
grave

"
 
<EOS>
at
length
they
be
reconcile
.
 
<EOS>
the
wife
be
compliment
with
a
share
of
miss
Jenny
's
bed
(
her
own

overflow
)
and
the
master
of
the
waggon
invite
Weazel
to
sleep
the
remain
part
of
the
night
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
retire
to
mine
,
where
I
find
Strap
mortally
afraid
,
he
have
get
away
in
the
dark
,
while
the
captain
and
his

be
at

I
desire
him
to
appease
the
incense
captain
,
who
by
this
time
have
get
into
the
kitchen
,
with
a
draw
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
threatne
with
many
oath
,
to
sacrifice
the
villain
,
who
attempt
to
violate
his
bed
;
but
it
be
to
no
purpose
for
the
master
to
explain
the
mistake
,
and
assure
him
of
the
poor
lad
's
innocence
,
who
stand
tremble
behind
me
all
the
while
:
the
more
submission
that
appear
in
Strap
,
the
more
implacable
seem
the
resentment
of
Weazel
,
who
swear
he
must
either
fight
him
,
or
he
would
instantly
put
him
to
death
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
extremely
provoke
at
this
insolence
,
and
tell
him
,
it
could
not
be
suppose
that
a
poor
barber
lad
would
engage
a
man
of
the
sword
at
his
own
weapon
;
but
I
be
persuade
he
would
wrestle
or
box
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
to
which
proposal
Strap
immediately
give
assent
,
by
say
,
he
would
box
with
him
for
a
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
Weazel
reply
with
a
look
of
disdain
,
it
be
beneath
any
gentleman
of
his
character
to
fight
like
a
porter
,
or
even
to
put
himself
on
a
footing
,
in
any
respect
,
with
such
a
fellow
as
Strap
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Strap
,
after
some
hesitation
,
answer
,
"
ye
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
will
cudgel
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
this
expedient
be
also
reject
by
the
captain
,
I
begin
to
smell
his
character
,
and
tip
Strap
the
wink
,
tell
the
company
,
that
I
have
always
hear
it
say
,
the
person
who
receive
a
challenge
should
have
the
choice
of
the
weapon
;
this
therefore
be
the
rule
in
point
of
honour
,
I
would
venture
to
promise
on
the
head
of
my
companion
,
that
he
would
even
fight
captain
Weazel
at
sharps
;
but
it
should
be
with
such
sharps
as
Strap
be
best
acquaint
with
,
namely
razor
.
 
<EOS>
at
my
mention
razor
,
I
could
perceive
the
captain
's
colour
to
change
,
while
Strap
pull
me
by
the
sleeve
,
whisper
with
great
eagerness
;
 
"
no
,
no
,
no
;
for
the
love
of
God
,
do
not
make
any
such
bargain
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
Weazel
recover
himself
,
turn
towards
me
,
and
with
a
ferocious
countenance
,
ask
,
"
who
the
devil
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
will
you
fight
me
?
"
    
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
put
himself
in
a
posture
,
I
be
grievously
alarm
at
see
the
point
of
a
sword
within
half
a
foot
of
my
breast
;
and
spring
to
one
side
,
snatch
up
a
spit
that
stand
in
the
chimney
corner
,
with
which
I
keep
my
formidable
adversary
at
bay
,
who
make
a
great
many
half
longe
,
skip
backward
every
time
,
till
at
last
I
get
him
pin
up
in
a
corner
,
to
the
no
small
diversion
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
in
this
situation
;
his
wife
enter
,
and
see
her
husband
in
these
dangerous
circumstance
,
utter
a
dreadful
scream
,
and
swoon
:
upon
this
,
Weazel
demand
a
cessation
,
which
be
immediately
grant
;
and
after
his
lady
have
recover
,
be
content
with
the
submission
of
Strap
,
who
fall
on
his
knee
before
him
,
protest
the
innocence
of
his
intention
,
and
ask
pardon
for
the
mistake
he
have
commit
.
<EOS>
this
affair
be
end
without
bloodshed
,
we
go
to
breakfast
,
but
miss
two
of
our
company
,
to
wit
,
miss
Jenny
and
the
usurer
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
first
,
Mrs
Weazel
inform
us
,
that
she
have
keep
her
awake
all
night
with
her
groan
;
and
that
when
she
get
up
this
morning
,
miss
Jenny
be
so
much
indisposed
,
that
she
could
not
proceed
on
her
journey
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
a
message
come
from
her
to
the
master
of
the
waggon
,
who
immediately
go
into
her
chamber
,
follow
by
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
him
in
a
lamentable
tone
,
that
she
be
afraid
of
a
miscarriage
owe
to
the
fright
she
receive
last
night
,
from
the
brutality
of
Isaac
;
and
as
the
event
be
uncertain
,
desire
the
usurer
may
be
detain
to
answer
for
the
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
this
ancient
Tarquin
be
find
in
the
waggon
,
whither
he
have
retire
to
avoid
the
shame
of
last
night
's
disgrace
;
and
bring
by
force
into
her
presence
.
     
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
appear
,
than
she
begin
to
weep
and
sigh
most
piteously
,
and
tell
us
,
if
she
die
,
she
would
leave
her
blood
upon
the
head
of
that
ravisher
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Isaac
,
turn
up
his
eye
and
hand
to
heaven
,
pray
that
God
would
deliver
him
from
the
machination
of
that
Jezabel
;
and
assure
us
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
that
his
be
find
in
bed
with
her
,
be
the
result
of
her
own
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
the
waggoner
understand
the
case
,
advise
Isaac
to
make
it
up
,
by
give
her
a
sum
of
money
,
to
which
he
reply
with
great
vehemence
,
"
a
sum

<EOS>
a
halter
for
the
cockatrice

"
 
<EOS>
"
o

'
<EOS>
tis

miss
Jenny
)
<EOS>
I
see
it
be
in
vain
to
attempt
that
flinty
heart
of
his
,
by
fair
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Joey
,
be
so
good
as
to
go
to
the
Justice
,
and
tell
him
there
be
a
sick
person
here
,
who
want
to
see
him
on
an
affair
of
consequence

"
 
<EOS>
at
the
name
of
justice
,
Isaac
tremble
like
an
aspen
-
leaf
,
and
bidding
Joey
stay
,
ask
with
a
faultere
voice
,
"
what
she
would
have
?
"
<EOS>
She
tell
him
,
that
as
he
have
not
perpetrate
his
wicked
purpose
,
she
would
be
satisfied
with
a
small
matter
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
the
damage
she
may
sustain
in
her
health
,
may
be
irreparable
,
she
would
give
him
a
release
for
an
hundred
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
"
an
hundred
guinea

<EOS>
(
cry
he
in
an
extasy
)
an

<EOS>
where

a
poor
old
wretch
like
me

if
I

I
would

season
of
the
year

"
 
<EOS>
"
come

(
reply
Jenny
)
<EOS>
none
of
your
miserly
artifice

<EOS>
You
think
I
do
not
know
Isaac
Rapine
<EOS>

broker
in

Minories

<EOS>
many
a

me
and
my

"
 
<EOS>
Isaac
find
it
be
in
vain
to
disguise
himself
,
offer
twenty
shilling
for
a
discharge
,
which
she
absolutely
refuse
under
fifty
pound
:
at
last
,
however
,
she
be
bring
down
to
five
,
which
he
pay
with
great
reluctancy
,
rather
than
be
prosecute
for
a
rape
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
this
sick
person
make
shift
to
get
into
the
waggon
,
and
we
set
forwards
in
great
tranquillity
,
Strap
be
accommodate
with
Joey
's
horse
,
the
driver
himself
chuse
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
this
morning
and
forenoon
we
be
entertain
with
an
account
of
the
valour
of
captain
Weazel
,
who
tell
us
of
his
have
once
knock
down
a
soldier
that
make
game
of
him
;
of
tweak
a
drawer
by
the
nose
,
who
find
fault
with
his
pick
his
tooth
with
a
fork
;
and
of
his
send
a
challenge
to
a
cheese
-
monger
,
who
have
the
presumption
to
be
his
rival
,
 
for
the
truth
of
which
he
appeal
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
confirm
whatever
he
say
,
and
observe
such
a
thing
happen
that
day
,
"
I
receive
a

and
do

Billy
,
Mrs
Weazel

<EOS>
"
and
I
answer
cavalierly
,
My
lord
,
I
wish
I
could
return
the
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
the
whole
company
break
out
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
;
and
my
lord
,
who
love
a
repartee
dearly

come
round
and
buff
me
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
We
travel
in
this
manner
five
day
,
without
interruption
or
meet
any
thing
worth
notice
:
<EOS>
Miss
Jenny
(
who
soon
recover
her
spirit
)
entertain
us
every
day
with
divert
song
,
of
which
she
could
sing
a
great
number
;
and
rally
her
old
gallant
,
who
notwithstanding
could
never
be
reconcile
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
sixth
day
,
while
we
be
about
to
sit
down
to
dinner
,
the
inn
-
keeper
come
and
tell
us
,
that
three
gentleman
just
arrive
,
have
order
the
victual
to
be
carry
to
their
apartment
,
altho
'
he
have
inform
them
that
they
be
bespeak
by
the
passenger
in
the
waggon
.
<EOS>
to
which
they
have
reply
,
"
the
passenger
in
the
waggon
may
be
damn'd
 
<EOS>
their
better
must
be
serve
before
them
,
 
<EOS>
they
suppose
it
would
be
no
hardship
on
such
traveller
to
dine
upon
bread
and
cheese
for
one
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
terrible
disappointment
to
us
all
;
and
we
lay
our
head
together
how
to
remedy
it
;
when
miss
Jenny
propose
that
captain
Weazel
,
be
by
profession
a
soldier
,
ought
in
this
case
to
protect
and
prevent
us
from
be
insult
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
captain
excuse
himself
,
say
,
he
would
not
for
the
world
be
know
to
have
travel
in
a
waggon
;
swear
at
the
same
time
,
that
could
he
appear
with
honour
,
they
should
eat
his
sword
sooner
than
his
provision
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
declaration
,
miss
Jenny
snatch
his
sword
,
draw
it
,
and
run
immediately
to
the
kitchin
,
where
she
threatne
to
put
the
cook
to
death
,
if
he
do
not
send
the
victual
into
our
chamber
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
the
noise
she
make
,
bring
the
three
stranger
down
,
one
of
whom
no
sooner
perceive
her
,
than
he
cry
out
,
"
ha
!
<EOS>
Jenny
Ramper
!
<EOS>
what
the
devil
bring
thee
hither
?
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Jack
Rattle
!
<EOS>
(
reply
she
,
run
into
his
arm
)
be
it
you
?
 
<EOS>
then
Weazel
may
go
to
hell
for
a
dinner
 
<EOS>
I
shall
dine
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
consent
to
this
,
with
a
great
deal
of
joy
;
and
we
be
on
the
point
of
be
reduce
to
a
very
uncomfortable
meal
,
when
Joey
understand
the
whole
affair
,
enter
the
kitchin
with
a
pitchfork
in
his
hand
,
swear
he
would
be
the
death
of
any
man
who
should
pretend
to
seize
the
victual
prepare
for
the
waggon
.
 
<EOS>
this
menace
have
like
to
have
produce
fatal
consequence
;
the
three
stranger
draw
their
sword
,
and
be
join
by
their
servant
,
and
we
range
ourselves
on
the
side
of
Joey
;
when
the
landlord
interpose
,
offer
to
part
with
his
own
dinner
to
keep
the
peace
,
which
be
accept
by
the
stranger
;
and
we
sit
down
at
table
without
any
further
molestation
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
I
choose
to
walk
along
with
Joey
,
and
Strap
take
my
place
.
 
<EOS>
have
enter
into
conversation
with
this
driver
,
I
soon
find
him
to
be
a
merry
,
facetious
,
good
-
natured
fellow
,
and
withal
very
arch
:
He
inform
me
,
that
miss
Jenny
be
a
common
girl
upon
the
town
,
who
fall
into
company
with
a
recruiting
officer
,
he
carry
her
down
in
the
stage
-
coach
from
London
to
Newcastle
,
where
he
have
be
arrest
for
debt
,
and
be
now
in
prison
;
upon
which
she
be
fain
to
return
to
her
former
way
of
life
,
in
the
manner
we
find
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
likewise
,
that
one
of
the
gentleman
's
servant
,
whom
we
leave
at
the
inn
,
have
accidentally
see
Weazel
,
immediately
know
him
,
and
acquaint
Joey
with
some
particular
of
his
character
,
as
follow
:
that
he
have
serve
my
lord
Frizzle
in
quality
of
valet
de
chambre
many
year
;
while
he
live
separate
from
his
lady
:
    
but
upon
their
reconciliation
,
she
expressly
insist
upon
Weazel
's
be
turn
off
,
as
well
as
the
woman
he
keep
:
whereupon
his
lordship
,
to
get
rid
of
them
both
with
a
good
grace
,
propose
that
he
should
marry
his
mistress
,
and
he
would
procure
a
commission
for
him
in
the
army
;
this
expedient
be
agree
to
,
and
Weazel
be
now
,
by
his
lordship
's
interest
,
ensign
in
#
#
#
#
's
regiment
.
<EOS>
I
find
he
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
same
sentiment
with
regard
to
Weazel
's
courage
,
which
we
resolve
to
put
to
the
trial
,
by
alarm
the
passenger
with
the
cry
of
,
"
an
highwayman
!
<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
we
should
discover
an
horseman
appear
.
<EOS>
this
we
put
in
practice
towards
the
dusk
,
when
we
descry
a
man
on
horseback
approach
us
.
<EOS>
Joey
have
no
sooner
intimate
to
the
people
in
the
waggon
,
that
he
be
afraid
we
should
be
all
rob
,
than
a
general
consternation
arise
:
<EOS>
strap
jump
out
of
the
waggon
and
hide
himself
behind
a
hedge
.
<EOS>
the
usurer
put
forth
ejaculation
,
and
make
a
rustling
among
the
straw
,
which
make
us
conjecture
he
have
hide
something
under
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Weazel
wring
her
hand
,
utter
lamentable
cry
;
and
the
captain
,
to
our
great
amazement
,
begin
to
snore
;
but
this
artifice
do
not
succeed
;

the
usurer
be
so
pleased
at
the
event
of

adventure
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
be
severe
,
and
take
notice
that

Weazel
seem
to
be
a
good
Christian

he
have
arm
himself

patience

out

fear

this
piece
of
satire
occasion
a
great
deal
of
mirth
at
Weazel
's
expence

who
mutter
a
great

oath

threatne
to
cut

chapter
XIII
Strap
and
I
be
terrify
by
an
apparition
 
<EOS>
Strap
's
conjecture
 
<EOS>
the
mystery
explain
by
Joey
 
<EOS>
we
arrive
at
London
 
<EOS>
our
dress
and
appearance
describe
 
we
be
insult
in
the
street
 
an
adventure
in
the
ale

house
 
<EOS>

footman
 
set
to
right
by
a
tobacconist
 
<EOS>
take
lodging
 
dive
for
a
dinner
 
<EOS>
an
accident
at
our
ordinary
.
  
<EOS>
We
arrive
at
our
inn
,
sup
and
go
to
bed
;
but
Strap
's
distemper
continue
,
he
be
oblige
to
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
take
the
candle
in
his
hand
,
which
he
have
leave
burn
for
the
purpose
,
he
go
down
to
the
house
of
office
;
whence
in
a
short
time
he
return
in
a
great
hurry
,
with
his
hair
stand
on
end
,
and
a
look
betokening
horror
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
without
speak
a
word
,
he
set
down
the
light
,
and
jump
into
bed
behind
me
,
where
he
lie
and
tremble
with
great
violence
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
ask
him
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
he
reply
,
with
a
break
accent
,
"
God
have
mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
devil
.
"
     
<EOS>
though
my
prejudice
be
not
quite
so
strong
as
his
,
I
be
not
a
little
alarmed
at
this
exclamation
,
and
much
more
so
,
<EOS>
when
I
hear
the
sound
of
bell
approach
our
chamber
,
and
feel
my
bedfellow
cle
close
to
me
,
utter
these
word
,
"
Christ
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
there
he
come
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
,
a
monstrous
overgrow
raven
enter
our
chamber
,
with
bell
at
its
foot
,
and
make
directly
towards
our
bed
.
 
<EOS>
as
this
creature
be
reckon
in
our
country
,
a
common
vehicle
for
the
devil
and
witch
to
play
their
prank
in
,
I
verily
believe
we
be
haunt
;
and
in
a
violent
fright
,
shrunk
my
head
under
the
bed
-
cloath
.
 
<EOS>
this
terrible
apparition
leapt
upon
the
bed
,
and
after
give
us
several
severe
dabb
with
its
beak
through
the
blanket
,
hop
away
,
and
vanish
.
<EOS>
strap
and
I
recommend
ourselves
to
the
protection
of
heaven
with
great
devotion
,
and
when
we
no
longer
hear
the
noise
,
venture
to
peep
up
and
take
breath
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
not
be
long
free
from
this
phantom
,
when
another
appear
,
that
have
<EOS>
well
nigh
deprive
us
both
of
our
sense
.
<EOS>
We
perceive
an
old
man
enter
the
room
,
with
a
long
white
beard
that
reach
to
his
middle
;
there
be
a
certain
wild
peculiarity
in
his
eye
and
countenance
,
that
do
not
favour
of
this
world
:
and
his
dress
consist
of
a
brown
stuff
coat
,
button
behind
,
and
at
the
wrist
,
and
an
odd
-
fashioned
cap
of
the
same
stuff
upon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
amazed
that
I
have
not
power
to
move
my
eye
from
such
a
ghastly
object
,
but
lie
motionless
,
and
see
him
come
streight
up
to
me
<EOS>
:
when
he
get
to
the
bed
,
he
wring
his
hand
,
and
cry
with
a
voice
that
do
not
seem
to
belong
to
a
human
creature
,
"
where
be
Ralph
?
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
reply
;
upon
which
,
he
repeat
in
an
accent
still
more
preternatural
;
"
<EOS>
where
be
Ralpho
?
"
     
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
pronounce
these
word
,
than
I
hear
the
sound
of
the
bell
at
a
distance
;
which
the
apparition
have
listen
to
,
tript
away
,
and
leave
me
almost
petrify
with
fear
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
while
before
I
could
recover
myself
so
far
as
to
speak
:
and
when
at
length
I
turn
about
to
Strap
,
I
find
him
in
a
fit
,
which
,
however
,
do
not
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
himself
,
I
ask
his
opinion
of
what
have
happen
;
and
he
assure
me
,
that
the
first
must
certainly
be
the
soul
of
some
person
damn
,
which
appear
by
the
chain
about
its
leg
(
for
his
fear
have
magnify
the
creature
to
the
bigness
of
a
horse
,
and
the
sound
of
small
morris
bell
to
the
clanking
of
massy
chain
)
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
old
man
,
he
take
it
to
be
the
spirit
of
somebody
<EOS>
murder
long
ago
in
this
place
,
which
have
power
grant
it
to
torment
the
assassin
in
the
shape
of
a
raven
,
and
that
Rapho
be
the
name
of
the
say
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
have
not
much
faith
in
his
interpretation
,
I
be
too
much
troubled
to
enjoy
any
sleep
;
and
in
all
my
future
adventure
,
never
pass
a
night
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
Strap
impart
the
whole
affair
to
Joey
,
who
after
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
,
explain
the
matter
,
by
tell
him
that
the
old
man
be
the
landlord
's
father
,
who
have
turn
idiot
some
year
ago
,
and
divert
himself
with
a
tame
raven
,
which
,
it
seem
,
have
hop
away
from
his
apartment
in
the
night
,
and
induce
him
to
follow
it
to
our
chamber
,
where
he
have
inquire
after
it
,
under
the
name
of
Ralpho
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
remarkable
happen
during
the
remain
part
of
our
journey
,
which
continue
six
or
seven
day
longer
:
at
length
we
enter
the
great
city
,
and
lodge
all
night
at
the
inn
,
where
the
waggon
halt
.
     
<EOS>
next
morning
,
all
the
passenger
part
different
way
;
while
my
companion
and
I
sally
out
to
enquire
for
the
member
of
parliament
to
whom
I
have
a
letter
of
recommendation
from
Mr
Crab
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
discharge
our
lodging
at
the
inn
,
Strap
take
up
our
baggage
,
and
march
behind
me
in
the
street
with
the
knapsack
on
his
back
,
as
usual
,
so
that
we
make
a
very
whimsical
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
dress
myself
to
the
great
advantage
;
that
is
,
put
on
a
clean
ruffle
shirt
,
my
good
thread
stocking
,
my
hair
(
which
be
of
the
deep
red
)
hang
down
upon
my
shoulder
,
as
lank
and
streight
as
a
pound
of
candle
;
and
the
skirt
of
my
coat
reach
to
the
middle
of
my
leg
;
my
waistcoat
and
breech
be
of
the
same
piece
,
and
cut
in
the
same
taste
;
my
hat
very
much
resemble
a
Barber
's
bason
in
the
shallowness
of
the
crown
and
narrowness
of
the
brim
.
<EOS>
strap
be
habit
in
a
much
less
aukward
manner
than
me
;
but
a
short
crop
-
eare
wig
that
very
much
resemble
Scrub
's
in
the
play
,
and
the
knapsack
on
his
back
,
add
to
what
be
call
a
queer
phiz
,
occasion
by
a
long
chin
,
an
hook
nose
,
and
high
cheek
bone
,
render
him
on
the
whole
a
very
fit
subject
of
mirth
and
pleasantry
.
<EOS>
as
we
walk
along
,
Strap
,
at
my
desire
,
enquire
of
a
carman
whom
we
meet
,
whereabout
Mr
Cringer
live
;
 
and
be
answer
by
a
stare
accompany
with
the
word
,
"
Anan
!
"
<EOS>
upon
which
I
come
up
in
order
to
explain
the
question
,
but
have
the
misfortune
to
be
unintelligible
likewise
,
the
carman
damn
us
for
a
lousy
Scotch
guard
,
and
whip
up
his
horse
with
a
"
Gee
ho
!
"
which
nettle
me
to
the
quick
,
and
rouse
the
indignation
of
Strap
so
far
,
that
after
the
fellow
be
go
a
good
way
,
he
tell
me
he
would
fight
him
for
a
farthing
.
     
<EOS>
while
we
be
deliberate
what
be
next
to
be
do
,
an
hackney
coachman
driving
softly
along
,
and
perceive
us
stand
by
the
kennel
,
come
up
close
to
us
,
and
call
,
"
a
coach
,
master
!
"
<EOS>
by
a
dexterous
management
of
the
rein
,
make
his
horse
stumble
in
the
wet
,
and
bedaub
us
all
over
with
mud
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
,
he
drive
on
,
applaud
himself
with
a
hearty
laugh
,
in
which
several
people
join
,
to
my
great
mortification
;
but
one
more
compassionate
than
the
rest
see
us
stranger
,
advise
me
to
go
into
an
ale
-
house
,
and
dry
myself
.
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
advice
,
which
I
immediately
comply
with
;
and
go
into
the
house
he
point
out
,
call
for
a
pot
of
beer
,
and
sit
down
by
the
fire
in
a
public
room
,
where
we
clean
ourselves
as
well
as
we
could
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
a
wag
who
sit
in
a
box
,
smoake
his
pipe
,
understanding
by
our
dialect
who
we
be
,
come
up
to
me
,
and
,
with
a
very
grave
countenance
,
ask
me
,
how
long
I
have
be
catch
?
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
his
question
,
I
make
no
answer
;
and
he
go
on
,
say
,
it
could
not
be
a
great
while
,
for
my
tail
be
not
yet
cut
;
at
the
same
time
take
hold
of
my
hair
,
and
tip
the
wink
to
the
rest
of
the
company
,
which
seem
highly
entertain
with
his
wit
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
incense
at
this
usage
,
but
afraid
of
resent
it
,
because
I
happen
to
be
in
a
strange
place
,
and
perceive
the
person
who
speak
to
me
,
be
a
brawny
fellow
,
for
whom
I
be
by
no
mean
a
match
.
<EOS>
however
,
Strap
have
either
more
courage
or
less
caution
,
could
not
put
up
with
the
insult
that
I
suffer
;
but
tell
him
with
a
peremptory
tone
,
"
He
be
an
uncivil
fellow
,
for
make
so
free
with
his
better
.
"
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
the
wit
go
toward
him
,
ask
,
"
what
he
have
get
in
his
knapsack
?
"
    
<EOS>
be
it
oat
-
meal
or
brimstone
,
Sawney
?
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
seize
him
by
the
chin
,
which
he
shake
to
the
inexpressible
diversion
of
all
present
.
 
<EOS>
My
companion
feel
himself
assault
in
such
an
opprobrious
manner
,
disengage
himself
in
a
trice
,
and
lend
his
antagonist
such
a
box
on
the
ear
,
as
make
him
stagger
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
;
and
in
a
moment
,
a
ring
be
form
for
the
combatant
.
 
<EOS>
see
Strap
begin
to
strip
,
and
my
blood
be
heat
with
indignation
,
which
banish
all
other
thought
,
I
undress
myself
to
the
skin
in
an
instant
,
and
declare
,
that
as
the
affront
that
occasion
the
quarrel
be
offer
to
me
,
I
would
fight
it
out
myself
;
upon
which
one
or
two
cry
out
,
"
that
be
a
brave
Scotch
boy
;
you
shall
have
fair
play
,
by
G
-
d
.
<EOS>
"
this
give
me
fresh
spirit
,
and
go
up
to
my
adversary
,
who
by
his
pale
countenance
,
do
not
seem
much
incline
to
the
battle
,
I
strike
him
so
hard
on
the
stomach
that
he
reel
over
a
bench
,
and
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
here
I
attempt
to
get
a
-
top
of
him
in
order
to
improve
my
success
,
accord
to
the
manner
of
my
own
country
;
but
be
restrain
by
the
spectator
,
one
of
whom
endeavour
to
raise
up
my
opponent
,
but
in
vain
;
for
he
protest
he
would
not
fight
,
not
be
quite
recover
of
a
late
illness
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
pleased
with
this
excuse
,
and
immediately
dress
myself
,
have
acquire
the
good
opinion
of
the
company
for
my
bravery
,
as
do
also
my
comrade
Strap
,
who
shake
me
by
the
hand
and
wish
me
joy
of
the
victory
.
     
<EOS>
after
have
drink
our
pot
,
and
dry
our
cloath
,
we
enquire
of
the
landlord
if
he
know
Mr
Cringer
the
member
of
parliament
,
and
be
amazed
at
his
replying
in
the
negative
;
for
we
imagine
,
he
must
be
every
bit
as
conspicuous
here
,
as
in
the
borough
he
represent
;
but
he
tell
us
we
may
possibly
hear
of
him
as
we
pass
along
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
street
,
where
,
see
a
footman
stand
at
a
door
,
we
make
up
to
him
,
and
ask
if
he
know
where
our
patron
live
.
 
<EOS>
this
member
of
the
party
-
colour
fraternity
,
survey
us
both
very
minutely
,
say
he
know
Mr
Cringer
very
well
,
and
bid
us
turn
down
the
first
street
on
our
left
,
then
turn
to
the
right
,
and
then
to
the
left
again
,
after
which
we
would
observe
a
lane
,
through
which
we
must
pass
,
and
at
the
other
end
we
should
find
an
alley
that
lead
to
another
street
,
where
we
should
see
the
sign
of
the
thistle
and
three
pedlar
,
and
there
he
lodge
.
 
<EOS>
We
thank
him
for
his
information
,
and
go
forwards
,
Strap
tell
me
,
that
he
know
this
person
to
be
an
honest
friendly
man
by
his
countenance
,
before
he
open
his
mouth
;
in
which
opinion
I
acquiesce
,
ascribe
his
good
manner
to
the
company
he
daily
see
in
the
house
where
he
serve
.
 
<EOS>
We
follow
his
direction
punctually
,
in
turn
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
,
and
to
the
left
again
;
but
instead
of
see
a
lane
before
us
,
we
find
ourselves
at
the
side
of
the
river
,
which
perplex
us
not
a
little
;
and
my
fellow
-
traveller
venture
to
pronounce
,
that
we
have
certainly
miss
our
way
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
we
be
pretty
much
fatigued
with
our
walk
,
and
not
know
how
to
proceed
,
I
go
into
a
small
snuff
-
shop
hard
by
,
encourage
by
the
sign
of
the
highlander
,
where
I
find
,
to
my
inexpressible
satisfaction
,
the
shop
-
keeper
my
countryman
.
     
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
informed
of
our
peregrination
,
and
the
direction
we
have
receive
from
the
footman
,
than
he
inform
us
we
have
be
impose
upon
,
tell
us
,
that
Mr
Cringer
live
in
the
other
end
of
the
town
;
and
that
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
for
us
to
go
thither
to
-
day
,
for
by
that
time
he
be
go
to
the
House
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
ask
him
if
he
could
recommend
us
to
a
lodging
,
which
he
readily
do
,
by
give
us
a
line
to
one
of
his
acquaintance
who
keep
a
chandler
's
shop
not
far
from
St
Martin
's
Lane
;
here
we
hire
a
bed
-
room
,
up
two
pair
of
stair
,
at
the
rate
of
2s
per
week
,
so
very
small
,
that
when
the
bed
be
let
down
,
we
be
oblige
to
carry
out
every
other
piece
of
furniture
that
belong
to
the
apartment
,
and
use
the
bedstead
by
way
of
chair
.
 
<EOS>
about
dinner
-
time
,
our
landlord
ask
us
how
we
propose
to
live
,
to
which
we
answer
,
that
we
would
be
direct
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
then
(
say
he
)
there
be
two
way
of
eat
in
this
town
,
for
people
of
your
condition
;
the
one
more
creditable
and
expensive
than
the
other
:
the
first
,
be
to
dine
at
an
eat
-
house
frequent
by
well
dress
people
only
,
and
the
other
be
call
-
diving
,
practise
by
those
who
be
either
oblige
or
incline
to
live
frugally
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
to
understand
that
provide
the
last
be
not
infamous
,
it
would
suit
much
better
with
our
circumstance
than
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Infamous
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
God
forbid
,
there
be
many
creditable
people
,
and
rich
people
,
ay
and
fine
people
,
that
dive
every
day
.
     
<EOS>
I
have
see
many
a
pretty
gentleman
bedaub
all
over
with
lace
,
dine
in
that
manner
,
very
comfortably
for
three
penny
half
-
penny
,
and
go
afterwards
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
make
a
figure
with
the
good
lord
in
the
land
;
 
but
your
own
eye
shall
bear
witness
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
along
with
you
to
-
day
and
introduce
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
accordingly
carry
us
to
a
certain
lane
,
<EOS>
where
stop
,
he
bid
us
observe
him
,
and
do
as
he
do
,
and
walk
a
few
pace
,
dive
into
a
cellar
and
disappear
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
I
follow
his
example
,
and
descend
very
successfully
,
where
I
find
myself
in
the
middle
of
a
cook
's
shop
,
almost
suffocate
with
the
steam
of
boil'd
beef
,
and
surround
by
a
company
consist
chiefly
of
hackney
-
coachman
,
chairman
,
drayman
,
and
a
few
footman
out
of
place
or
on
board
wage
;
who
sit
eat
shin
of
beef
,
tripe
,
cow
-
heel
or
sausage
,
at
separate
board
,
cover
with
cloth
,
which
turn
my
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
stand
in
amaze
,
undetermined
whether
to
sit
down
or
walk
upwards
again
,
Strap
,
in
his
descent
miss
one
of
the
step
,
tumble
headlong
into
this
infernal
ordinary
,
and
overturn
the
cook
as
she
be
carry
a
porringer
of
soup
to
one
of
the
guest
:
in
her
fall
,
she
dash
the
whole
mess
against
the
leg
of
a
drummer
belong
to
the
foot
guard
,
who
happen
to
be
in
her
way
,
and
scald
him
so
miserably
,
that
he
start
up
,
and
dance
up
and
down
,
utter
a
volley
of
execration
that
make
my
hair
stand
on
end
.
<EOS>
while
he
entertain
the
company
in
this
manner
,
with
an
eloquence
peculiar
to
himself
,
the
cook
get
up
,
and
after
a
hearty
curse
on
the
poor
author
of
this
mischance
,
who
lie
under
the
table
scratch
his
rump
with
a
woful
countenance
,
empty
a
salt
-
seller
in
her
hand
,
and
strip
down
the
patient
's
stocking
which
bring
the
skin
along
with
it
,
apply
the
content
to
the
sore
.
     
<EOS>
this
poultice
be
scarce
lay
on
,
when
the
drummer
,
who
have
begin
to
abate
of
his
exclamation
,
break
forth
into
such
a
hideous
yell
,
as
make
the
whole
company
tremble
;
then
seize
a
pewter
pint
-
pot
that
stand
by
him
,
squeeze
the
side
of
it
together
,
as
if
it
have
be
make
of
pliant
leather
,
grind
his
tooth
at
the
same
time
with
a
most
horrible
grin
.
<EOS>
guess
the
cause
of
this
violent
transport
,
I
bid
the
woman
wash
off
the
salt
,
and
bathe
the
part
with
oil
,
which
she
do
,
and
procure
him
immediate
ease
.
<EOS>
but
here
another
difficulty
occur
,
which
be
no
other
than
the
landlady
's
insist
on
his
pay
for
the
pot
he
have
render
useless
;
he
swear
he
would
pay
for
nothing
but
what
he
have
eat
,
and
bid
her
be
thankful
for
his
moderation
,
or
else
he
would
prosecute
her
for
damage
.
 
<EOS>
strap
foreseeing
it
would
all
land
at
him
,
promise
to
satisfy
the
cook
,
and
call
for
a
dram
of
gin
to
treat
the
drummer
with
,
which
entirely
appease
him
,
and
compose
all
animosity
.
<EOS>
after
this
our
landlord
and
we
sit
down
at
a
board
,
and
dine
upon
shin
of
beef
most
deliciously
;
our
reckoning
amount
to
two
penny
halfpenny
each
,
bread
and
small
beer
include
.

chapter
XIV
We
visit
Strap
's
friend
 
a
description
of
him
 
<EOS>
his
advice
 
<EOS>
we
go
to
Mr
Cringer
's
house
 
<EOS>
be
deny
admittance
 
<EOS>
an
accident
befal
Strap
 
<EOS>
his
behaviour
thereupon
 
<EOS>
an
extraordinary
adventure
occur
,
in
the
course
of
which
I
lose
all
my
money
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
my
companion
propose
to
to
call
at
his
friend
's
house
,
which
,
we
be
inform
,
be
in
the
neighbourhood
,
whither
we
accordingly
go
,
and
be
so
lucky
as
to
find
him
at
home
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
who
have
come
from
Scotland
three
or
four
year
ago
,
keep
a
school
in
town
,
where
he
teach
the
Latin
,
french
and
italian
language
;
but
what
he
chiefly
profess
be
the
pronounciation
of
the
english
tongue
,
after
a
method
more
speedy
and
uncommon
than
any
practised
heretofore
;
and
indeed
if
his
scholar
speak
like
their
master
,
the
latter
part
of
his
undertaking
be
certainly
perform
to
a
tittle
;
for
although
I
could
easily
understand
every
word
of
what
I
have
hear
hitherto
since
I
enter
England
,
three
part
in
four
of
his
dialect
be
as
unintelligible
to
me
,
as
if
he
have
speak
in
Arabick
or
Irish
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
middle
-
sized
man
,
and
stoop
very
much
,
though
not
above
the
age
of
forty
;
his
face
be
very
much
pit
with
the
small
-
pox
,
his
eye
blear'd
,
and
his
mouth
extend
from
ear
to
ear
.
     
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
a
night
-
gown
of
plaid
,
fasten
about
his
middle
with
a
serjeant
's
old
sash
,
and
a
tie
-
perriwig
with
a
fore
-
top
three
inch
high
,
in
the
fashion
of
king
Charles
the
second
's
reign
.
 
<EOS>
after
he
have
receive
Strap
(
who
be
relate
to
him
)
very
courteously
,
he
enquire
of
him
,
who
I
be
:
and
be
inform
,
take
me
by
the
hand
,
tell
me
<EOS>
,
he
be
at
school
with
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
understand
my
situation
,
he
assure
me
that
he
would
do
me
all
the
service
in
his
power
,
both
by
his
advice
and
otherwise
;
and
while
he
speak
these
word
,
he
eye
me
with
great
attention
,
walk
round
me
several
time
,
and
muttering
,
"
o
Ch####st
!
<EOS>
o
Ch####st
!
<EOS>
fat
a
saight
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
soon
guess
the
reason
of
of
his
ejaculation
,
and
say
,
"
I
suppose
,
sir
,
you
be
not
pleased
with
my
dress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dress

answer
he
)
<EOS>
you
may
caal
it
<EOS>
fat
<EOS>
you
please
,
in
your
country
,
but
I

here
.
 
<EOS>
no
christian
will
admit
such
a
figure
into
his
hawse
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
conscience
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
the
dog
do
not
hunt
you
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
pass
through
St
James
's
market
?
 
<EOS>
God

<EOS>
you
look
like
a
cousin
-
german
of
Ouran
Outang
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
a
little
serious
at
this
discourse
,
and
ask
him
,
if
he
think
I
should
obtain
entrance
tomorrow
at
the
house
Mr
Cringer
,
on
whom
I
chiefly
depend
,
for
an
introduction
into
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Cringer
,
Mr
Cringer
(
reply
he
,
scratch
his
cheek
)
may
be
a
very
honest
gentleman
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
;
but
be
your
sole
dependance
upon
him
?
 
<EOS>
who
recommend
you
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
pull
out
Mr
Crab
's
letter
,
and
tell
him
the
foundation
of
my
hope
;
at
which
he
stare
at
me
,
and
repeat
,
"
o
Ch####st
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
conceive
bad
omen
from
this
behaviour
of
his
,
and
beg
he
would
assist
me
with
his
advice
;
which
he
promise
to
do
very
frankly
;
and
as
a
speciman
,
direct
us
to
a
perriwig
ware
-
house
,
in
the
neighbourhood
,
in
order
to
be
accommodate
;
lay
strong
injunction
on
me
not
to
appear
before
Mr
Cringer
,
till
I
have
part
with
these
carroty
lock
,
which
(
he
say
)
be
sufficient
to
beget
an
antipathy
against
me
,
in
all
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
we
be
go
to
pursue
this
advice
,
he
call
me
back
,
and
bid
me
be
sure
to
deliver
my
letter
into
Mr
Cringer
's
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
walk
along
,
Strap
triumph
greatly
in
our
reception
with
his
friend
,
who
(
it
seem
)
have
assure
him
,
he
would
in
a
day
or
two
provide
for
him
,
with
some
good
master
;
and
"
now
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
shall
see
how
I
will
fit
you
with
a
wig
 
<EOS>
there
be
ne'er
<EOS>
a
barber
in
London
<EOS>
(
and
that
be
a
bold
word
)
can
palm
a
rotten
caul
,
or
a
penny
-
weight
of
dead
hair
upon
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
this
zealous
adherent
do
wrangle
so
long
with
the
merchant
,
that
he
be
desire
twenty
time
to
leave
the
shop
,
and
see
if
he
could
get
one
cheap
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
at
length
I
make
choice
of
a
good
handsome
bob
,
for
which
I
pay
fifteen
shilling
;
and
return
to
our
lodging
,
where
Strap
,
in
a
moment
,
rid
me
of
that
hair
which
have
give
the
school
-
master
so
much
offence
.
    
<EOS>
We
get
up
next
day
betime
,
have
be
inform
that
Mr
Cringer
give
audience
by
candle
-
light
to
all
his
dependant
,
he
himself
be
oblige
to
attend
the
levee
of
my
lord
Terrier
,
at
break
of
day
;
because
his
lordship
make
one
at
the
minister
's
between
eight
and
nine
a
-
clock
.
     
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
Mr
Cringer
's
door
,
Strap
,
to
give
me
an
instance
of
his
politeness
,
run
to
the
knocker
,
which
he
employ
so
loud
and
so
long
,
that
he
alarm
the
whole
street
;
and
a
window
open
up
two
pair
of
stair
in
the
next
house
,
a
chamber
-
pot
be
discharge
upon
him
so
successfully
,
that
the
poor
barber
be
wet
to
the
skin
,
while
I
,
be
luckily
at
some
distance
,
escape
the
unsavoury
deluge
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
a
footman
open
the
door
,
and
seein
no
body
in
the
street
but
us
,
ask
with
a
stern
countenance
,
if
it
be
I
who
make
such
a
damned
noise
,
and
what
I
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
have
business
with
his
master
,
whom
I
desire
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
,
he
clapt
the
door
in
my
face
,
tell
me
,
I
must
learn
well
manner
before
I
could
have
access
to
his
master
.
<EOS>
vex
at
this
disappointment
,
I
turn
my
resentment
against
Strap
,
whom
I
sharply
reprimand
for
his
presumption
;
but
he
not
in
the
least
regard
what
I
say
,
wring
the
urine
out
of
his
perriwig
,
and
lift
up
a
large
stone
,
fling
it
with
such
force
against
the
street
-
door
of
that
house
from
whence
he
have
be
bedew
,
that
the
lock
give
way
,
it
fly
wide
open
,
and
he
take
to
his
heel
,
leave
me
to
follow
him
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
no
time
for
deliberation
;
I
therefore
pursue
him
with
all
the
speed
I
could
exert
,
until
we
find
ourselves
,
about
the
dawn
,
in
a
street
we
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
here
as
we
wander
along
,
gape
about
,
a
very
decent
sort
of
a
man
,
pass
by
me
,
stop
of
a
sudden
,
and
take
up
something
,
which
have
examine
,
he
turn
,
and
present
it
to
me
with
these
word
,
"
Sir
,
you
have
dropt
half
a
crown
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
little
surprized
at
this
instance
of
honesty
,
and
tell
him
,
it
do
not
belong
to
me
;
but
he
bid
me
recollect
and
see
if
all
my
money
be
safe
,
upon
which
I
pull
out
my
purse
(
for
I
have
buy
one
since
I
come
to
town
)
and
reckon
my
money
in
my
hand
,
which
be
now
reduce
to
five
guinea
,
seven
shilling
and
two
penny
,
I
assure
him
I
have
lose
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
then
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
so
much
the
well
,
 
this
be
God
-
send
 
<EOS>
and
as
you
two
be
present
when
I
pick
it
up
<EOS>
,
you
be
entitle
to
equal
share
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
astonish
at
these
word
,
and
look
upon
this
person
to
be
a
prodigy
of
integrity
,
but
absolutely
refuse
any
part
of
the
sum
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
gentleman
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
be
too
modest
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
be
stranger
 
<EOS>
but
you
shall
give
me
leave
to
treat
you
with
a
whet
this
cold
raw
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
I
would
have
decline
this
invitation
,
but
Strap
whisper
to
me
,
that
the
gentleman
would
be
affront
,
and
I
comply
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
(
say
the
stranger
)
<EOS>
I
be
quite
ignorant
of
this
part
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
inform
him
that
we
be
in
the
same
situation
:
upon
which
he
propose
to
go
into
the
first
public
house
we
should
find
open
.
<EOS>
as
we
walk
together
,
he
begin
in
this
manner
:
 
"
I
find
by
your
tongue
you
be
come
from
Scotland
,
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
My
grandmother
by
the
father
's
side
be
of
your
country
,
which
have
prepossess
me
so
much
in
its
favour
,
that
I
never
meet
a
Scotchman
but
my
heart
warm
.
 
<EOS>
the
Scots
be
a
very
brave
people
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
scarce
a
great
family
in
the
kingdom
,
that
can
not
boast
of
some
exploit
perform
by
its
ancestor
many
hundred
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
your
douglass
,
Gordons
,
Campbels
,
Hamiltons
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
such
ancient
family
here
in
England
.
     
<EOS>
then
you
be
all
very
well
educate
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
pedlar
talk
in
Greek
and
Hebrew
,
as
well
as
if
they
have
be
his
mother
tongue
 
<EOS>
and
for
honesty
 
I
once
have
a
servant
,
his
name
be
Gregory
Macgregor
,
I
would
have
trust
him
with
untold
gold
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
eulogium
on
my
native
country
,
gain
my
affection
so
strongly
,
that
I
believe
I
could
have
go
to
death
to
serve
the
author
;
and
Strap
's
eye
swam
in
tear
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
as
we
pass
through
a
dark
narrow
lane
,
we
perceive
a
public
house
,
which
we
enter
;
and
find
a
man
sit
by
the
fire
,
smoake
a
pipe
with
a
pint
of
purl
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Our
new
acquaintance
ask
us
,
if
ever
we
have
drink
egg
flip
;
to
which
we
answer
in
the
negative
,
he
assure
us
of
a
regale
,
and
order
a
quart
to
be
prepared
,
call
for
pipe
and
tobacco
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
We
find
this
composition
very
palatable
,
and
drink
heartily
;
the
conversation
(
which
be
introduce
by
the
gentleman
)
turn
upon
the
snare
that
young
unexperienced
people
be
expose
to
in
this
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
He
describe
a
thousand
cheat
that
be
daily
practise
upon
the
ignorant
and
unwary
;
and
warn
us
of
them
with
so
much
good
-
nature
and
concern
,
that
we
bless
the
opportunity
which
throw
us
into
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
after
we
have
put
the
cann
about
for
some
time
,
our
new
friend
begin
to
yawn
,
tell
us
he
have
be
up
all
night
with
a
sick
person
;
and
propose
we
should
have
recourse
to
some
diversion
to
keep
him
awake
.
     
<EOS>
"
Suppose
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
we
should
take
a
hand
at
whist
for
pastime
 
<EOS>
but
let
me
see
,
that
will
not
do
,
there
be
only
three
of
us
;
and
I
can
not
play
at
any
other
game
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
seldom
or
never
play
,
but
out
of
complaisance
,
or
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
when
I
be
in
danger
of
fall
asleep
.
"
 
<EOS>
although
I
have
no
great
inclination
for
gaming
,
I
feel
no
aversion
to
pass
an
hour
or
two
at
card
with
a
friend
;
and
know
that
Strap
understand
as
much
of
the
matter
as
I
,
make
no
scruple
of
say
,
"
I
wish
we
could
find
a
fourth
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
in
this
perplexity
,
the
person
whom
we
find
at
our
entrance
,
overhear
our
discourse
,
take
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
very
gravely
,
and
accost
us
thus
:
"
gentleman
,
my
pipe
be
out
,
you
see
,
(
shake
the
ashe
into
the
fire
)
and
rather
than
you
should
be
baulk
,
I
do
not
care
if
I
take
a
hand
with
you
,
for
a
trifle
,
 
but
remember
I
will
not
play
for
any
thing
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
accept
his
profer
with
pleasure
;
and
have
cut
for
partner
,
it
fall
to
my
lot
to
play
with
him
,
against
our
friend
and
Strap
,
for
three
penny
a
game
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
so
successful
,
that
in
a
short
time
I
be
half
a
crown
gainer
;
when
the
gentleman
whom
we
have
meet
in
the
street
observe
he
have
no
luck
to
-
day
,
propose
to
leave
off
,
or
change
partner
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
be
inflame
with
my
good
fortune
,
and
the
expectation
of
improve
it
,
as
I
perceive
the
two
stranger
plaid
but
indifferently
:
therefore
I
vote
for
give
him
his
revenge
,
with
which
he
comply
after
some
intreaty
,
and
cut
again
,
Strap
and
I
(
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
)
happen
to
be
partner
.
 
<EOS>
My
good
fortune
attend
me
still
,
and
in
less
than
an
hour
,
we
have
get
thirty
shilling
of
their
money
;
for
as
they
lose
,
they
grow
the
keener
and
double
stake
every
time
.
    
<EOS>
at
last
the
inconstant
goddess
begin
to
veer
about
,
and
we
be
very
soon
stript
of
all
our
gain
,
and
about
forty
shilling
of
our
own
money
.
<EOS>
this
mortify
me
extremely
,
and
have
a
visible
effect
on
the
muscle
of
Strap
's
face
,
which
lengthen
apace
;
but
our
antagonist
perceive
our
condition
,
kindly
permit
us
to
retrieve
our
loss
,
and
console
ourselves
with
a
new
acquisition
.
 
<EOS>
then
my
companion
wisely
suggest
it
be
time
to
begone
;
upon
which
,
the
person
who
have
join
us
in
the
house
begin
to
curse
the
card
;
and
mutter
that
we
be
indebte
to
fortune
only
for
what
we
have
get
,
no
part
of
our
success
be
owe
to
our
good
play
.
 
<EOS>
this
insinuation
nettle
me
so
much
,
that
I
challenge
him
to
continue
the
game
for
a
crown
;
and
he
be
with
difficulty
persuade
to
accept
the
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
this
contest
end
in
less
than
an
hour
,
to
my
inexpressible
affliction
,
who
lose
every
shilling
of
my
own
money
,
Strap
absolutely
refuse
to
supply
me
with
a
six
-
pence
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
at
whose
request
we
have
come
in
,
perceive
by
my
disconsolate
look
the
situation
of
my
heart
,
which
well
nigh
burst
with
grief
and
resentment
,
when
the
other
stranger
get
up
,
and
go
away
with
my
money
;
begin
in
this
manner
:
"
I
be
truly
afflict
at
your
bad
luck
,
and
would
willingly
repair
it
,
be
it
in
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
could
provoke
you
to
tempt
your
fate
so
long
?
<EOS>
It
be
always
a
maxim
with
gamester
to
pursue
success
as
far
as
it
will
go
,
and
to
stop
whenever
fortune
shift
about
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
young
man
,
and
your
passion
too
impetuous
;
you
must
learn
to
govern
them
better
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
experience
like
that
which
be
buy
;
you
will
be
the
well
for
this
the
long
day
you
have
to
live
.
     
<EOS>
as
for
the
fellow
who
have
get
your
money
,
I
do
not
half
like
him
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
observe
me
<EOS>
tip
you
<EOS>
the
wink
,
to
leave
off
in
time
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
(
continue
he
)
<EOS>
you
be
too
eager
to
mind
any
thing
but
the
game
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
harkee
,
(
say
he
,
in
a
whisper
)
be
you
satisfied
of
that
young
man
's
honesty
?
<EOS>
his
look
be
a
little
suspicious
;
 
but
I
may
be
mistake
;
 
he
make
a
great
many
grimace
while
he
stand
behind
you
;
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
wicked
town
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
very
well
convinced
of
my
comrade
's
integrity
,
and
that
the
grimace
he
mention
be
doubtless
owe
to
his
anxiety
at
my
loss
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
ho
!
<EOS>
if
that
be
the
case
,
I
ask
his
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Landlord
,
see
what
be
to
pay
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
reckoning
come
to
eighteen
penny
,
which
have
discharge
,
the
gentleman
shake
us
both
by
the
hand
,
and
say
he
should
be
very

XV
Strap
moralize
 
present
his
purse
to
me
 
<EOS>
we
inform
our
landlord
of
my
misfortune
,
who
unravel
the
mystery
 
<EOS>
I
present
myself
to
Cringer
 
<EOS>
he
recommend
and
turn
me
over
to
Mr
Staytape
 
<EOS>
I
become
acquainted
with
a
fellow
-
dependant
,
who
explain
the
character
of
Cringer
and
Staytape
 
and
inform
me
of
the
method
to
be
pursue
at
the
Navy
-
office
and
Surgeon's
-
hall
 
Strap
be
employ
.
  
<EOS>
in
our
way
to
our
lodging
,
after
a
profound
silence
on
both
side
,
Strap
with
a
hideous
groan
observe
,
that
we
have
bring
our
pig
to
a
fine
market
.
<EOS>
to
this
I
make
no
reply
,
and
he
go
on
:
"
God
send
us
well
out
of
this
place
,
we
have
not
be
in
London
eight
and
forty
hour
,
and
I
believe
we
have
meet
with
eight
and
forty
thousand
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
be
jeer
,
reproach
,
buffette
,
piss
upon
,
and
at
last
stript
of
our
money
;
and
I
suppose
by
and
by
we
shall
be
stript
of
our
skin
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
to
the
money
part
of
it
,
that
be
owe
to
our
own
folly
;
Solomon
say
,
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
,
and
he
will
never
be
wise
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
God
help
us
,
an
ounce
of
prudence
be
worth
a
pound
of
gold
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
be
no
time
for
him
to
tamper
with
my
disposition
,
already
mad
with
my
loss
,
and
inflame
with
resentment
against
him
,
who
have
refuse
me
a
little
money
to
attempt
to
retrieve
it
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
,
turn
towards
him
with
a
stern
countenance
,
and
ask
him
,
"
who
he
call
fool
!
"
<EOS>
be
altogether
unaccustomed
with
such
look
from
me
,
he
stand
still
and
stare
in
my
face
for
some
time
;
then
,
with
some
confusion
,
utter
"
Fool
!
 
<EOS>
I
call
no
body
fool
but
myself
;
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
<EOS>
,
I
be
the
great
fool
of
the
two
,
for
be
so
much
concerned
at
other
people
's
misfortune
;
 
but
Nemo
omnibus
horis
sapit
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
which
a
silence
ensue
that
bring
us
to
our
lodging
,
where
I
throw
myself
into
the
bed
in
an
agony
of
despair
,
resolve
to
perish
for
want
,
rather
than
apply
to
my
companion
or
any
other
body
for
relief
;
but
Strap
,
who
know
my
temper
,
and
whose
heart
bleed
within
him
at
my
distress
,
after
some
pause
,
come
to
the
bed
-
side
,
and
put
a
leather
purse
into
my
hand
,
burst
into
tear
,
cry
,
"
I
know
what
you
think
:
<EOS>
but
I
scorn
your
thought
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
all
I
have
in
the
world
,
take
it
,
and
I
will
perhaps
get
more
for
you
before
that
be
do
 
if
not
,
I
will
beg
for
you
,
steal
for
you
,
go
through
the
wide
world
with
you
,
and
starve
with
you
,
for
though
I
be
a
poor
cobler
's
son
,
I
be
no
scout
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
touch
with
the
generous
passion
of
this
poor
creature
,
that
I
could
not
refrain
from
weep
also
,
and
we
mingle
our
tear
together
for
some
time
.
     
<EOS>
upon
examine
the
purse
,
I
find
in
it
two
half
guinea
and
half
a
crown
,
which
I
would
have
return
to
him
,
say
,
he
know
better
than
I
how
to
manage
it
;
but
he
absolutely
refuse
my
proposal
,
and
tell
me
,
it
be
more
reasonable
and
decent
that
he
should
depend
upon
me
who
be
a
gentleman
,
than
that
I
should
be
controule
by
him
.
    
<EOS>
after
this
friendly
contest
be
over
,
and
our
mind
more
at
ease
,
we
inform
our
landlord
of
what
have
happen
to
us
,
take
care
to
conceal
the
extremity
to
which
we
be
reduce
:
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
hear
the
story
,
than
he
assure
us
we
have
be
grievously
impose
upon
by
a
couple
of
sharper
,
who
be
associate
;
and
that
this
polite
,
honest
,
friendly
,
humane
person
,
who
have
treat
us
so
civilly
,
be
no
other
than
a
rascally
money
-
dropper
,
who
make
it
his
business
to
decoy
stranger
in
that
manner
,
to
one
of
his
own
haunt
,
where
an
accomplice
or
two
be
always
wait
to
assist
in
pillage
the
prey
they
have
run
down
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
good
man
recount
a
great
many
story
of
people
who
have
be
seduce
,
cheat
,
pilfer
,
beat
,
 
<EOS>
nay
,
even
murder
by
such
villain
.
<EOS>
I
be
confound
at
the
artifice
and
wickedness
of
mankind
,
and
Strap
lift
up
his
eye
and
hand
to
heaven
,
pray
that
God
would
deliver
him
from
scene
of
such
iniquity
;
for
surely
the
devil
have
set
up
his
throne
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Our
landlord
be
curious
to
know
what
reception
we
have
meet
with
at
Mr
Cringer
's
,
we
acquaint
him
with
the
particular
,
at
which
he
shake
his
head
,
and
tell
us
,
we
have
not
go
the
right
way
to
work
;
that
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
with
a
m####b####r
of
p####m####t
without
a
bribe
;
that
the
servant
be
commonly
infect
with
the
master
's
disease
,
and
expect
to
be
pay
for
his
work
,
as
well
as
his
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
advise
me
to
give
the
footman
a
shilling
the
next
time
I
desire
admittance
to
my
patron
,
or
else
I
should
scarce
find
an
opportunity
to
deliver
my
letter
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
next
morning
,
when
the
door
be
open
,
I
slipt
a
shilling
into
his
hand
,
and
tell
him
I
have
a
letter
for
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
good
effect
of
my
liberality
;
for
the
fellow
let
me
in
immediately
,
and
take
the
letter
out
of
my
hand
,
desire
me
to
wait
in
a
kind
of
passage
,
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
in
this
place
I
continue
stand
three
quarter
of
an
hour
,
during
which
time
I
see
a
great
many
young
fellow
,
whom
I
formerly
know
in
Scotland
,
pass
and
repass
,
with
an
air
of
familiarity
in
their
way
to
and
from
the
audience
chamber
:
while
I
be
fain
to
stand
shivering
in
the
cold
,
and
turn
my
back
to
them
,
that
they
may
not
perceive
the
lowness
of
my
condition
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
Mr
Cringer
come
out
to
see
a
young
gentleman
to
the
door
,
who
be
no
other
than
"
squire
Gawky
,
dress
in
a
very
gay
suit
of
cloath
:
<EOS>
at
part
Mr
Cringer
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
tell
him
he
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
his
company
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
then
turn
about
towards
me
,
ask
what
be
my
command
:
when
he
understand
I
be
the
person
who
have
bring
the
letter
from
Mr
Crab
,
he
affect
to
recollect
my
name
,
which
however
,
he
pretend
he
could
not
do
,
till
he
have
consult
the
letter
again
;
to
save
him
that
trouble
,
I
tell
him
my
name
be
Random
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
he
go
on
,
"
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
Random
,
Random
,
Random
 
I
think
I
remember
the
name
;
"
and
very
well
he
may
,
for
this
very
individual
Mr
Cringer
have
many
a
time
ride
before
my
grandfather
's
cloak
-
bag
,
in
quality
of
footman
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
propose
to
go
on
board
a
man
of
war
,
as
surgeon
's
mate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
which
I
reply
by
a
low
bow
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
will
be
a
difficult
matter
(
continue
he
)
to
procure
a
warrant
,
there
be
already
such
a
swarm
of
Scotch
surgeon
at
the
navy
office
,
in
expectation
of
the
next
vacancy
,
that
the
commissioner
be
afraid
of
be
tear
in
piece
,
and
have
actually
apply
for
a
guard
to
protect
them
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
some
ship
will
soon
be
put
in
commission
,
and
then
we
shall
see
what
be
to
be
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
leave
me
,
exceedingly
mortify
at
the
different
reception
Mr
Gawky
and
I
have
meet
with
from
this
upstart
,
proud
,
mean
member
,
who
(
I
imagine
)
would
have
think
it
an
happiness
to
have
it
in
his
power
to
be
grateful
for
the
obligation
he
owe
to
my
family
.
    
<EOS>
at
my
return
,
I
be
surprize
with
the
agreeable
news
of
Strap
's
be
employ
on
the
recommendation
of
his
friend
the
school
-
master
,
by
a
perriwig
-
maker
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
allow
him
five
shilling
per
week
,
besides
bed
and
board
.
 
<EOS>
I
continue
to
dance
attendance
every
other
morning
at
the
levee
of
Mr
Cringer
,
during
a
fortnight
,
in
which
time
I
become
acquaint
with
a
young
fellow
of
my
own
country
and
profession
,
who
also
depend
on
the
member
's
interest
;
but
be
treat
with
much
more
respect
than
I
,
both
by
the
servant
and
master
,
be
often
admit
into
a
parlour
,
where
there
be
a
fire
,
for
the
convenience
of
the
well
sort
of
those
who
wait
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
I
be
never
permit
to
penetrate
on
account
of
my
appearance
,
which
be
not
at
all
fashionable
;
but
be
oblige
to
stand
blow
my
finger
in
a
cold
lobby
,
and
take
the
first
opportunity
of
Mr
Cringer
's
go
to
the
door
,
to
speak
with
him
.
     
<EOS>
one
day
,
while
I
enjoy
this
occasion
,
a
person
be
introduce
,
whom
Mr
Cringer
no
sooner
see
,
then
run
towards
him
,
he
salute
him
with
a
bow
to
the
very
ground
,
and
afterwards
shake
him
by
the
hand
with
great
heartiness
and
familiarity
,
call
him
his
good
friend
,
and
ask
very
kindly
how
Mrs
Staytape
,
and
the
young
lady
do
;
then
,
after
a
whisper
which
continue
some
minute
,
wherein
I
over
-
hear
the
word
Honour
repeat
several
time
with
great
emphasis
,
Mr
Cringer
introduce
me
to
this
gentleman
,
as
to
a
person
whose
advice
and
assistance
I
may
depend
upon
,
and
have
give
me
his
direction
,
follow
me
to
the
door
,
where
he
tell
me
,
I
need
not
give
myself
the
trouble
to
call
at
his
house
any
more
,
for
Mr
Staytape
would
do
my
business
for
me
.
<EOS>
at
that
instant
my
fellow
dependant
come
out
after
me
,
over
-
hear
the
discourse
of
Mr
Cringer
,
and
make
up
to
me
in
the
street
,
accost
me
very
civilly
,
which
I
look
upon
as
no
small
honour
,
consider
the
figure
he
make
;
for
he
be
dress
in
a
blue
frock
with
a
gold
button
,
a
green
silk
waistcoat
trim
with
gold
,
black
velvet
breech
,
white
silk
stocking
,
silver
buckle
,
a
gold
-
laced
hat
,
a
spencer
wig
,
and
a
silver
hilte
hanger
,
with
a
fine
clouded
cane
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
be
but
lately
come
from
Scotland
:
 
<EOS>
pray
what
may
your
business
with
Mr
Cringer
be
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
no
secret
 
<EOS>
and
I
may
possibly
give
you
some
advice
that
will
be
serviceable
;
for
I
have
be
surgeon
's
second
mate
on
board
of
a
seventy
-
gun
ship
,
and
consequently
know
a
good
deal
of
the
world
.
"
     
<EOS>
I
make
no
scruple
to
disclose
my
situation
,
which
when
he
have
learn
,
he
shake
his
head
,
and
tell
me
he
have
be
pretty
much
in
the
same
circumstance
about
a
year
ago
;
that
he
have
rely
on
Cringer
's
promise
so
long
,
that
his
money
(
which
be
considerable
)
as
well
as
his
credit
,
be
quite
exhausted
;
and
when
he
write
to
his
relation
for
a
fresh
supply
,
instead
of
money
,
he
receive
nothing
but
reproach
,
and
the
epithet
of
idle
,
debauch
fellow
:
<EOS>
that
after
he
have
wait
at
the
Navy
-
Office
many
month
for
a
warrant
,
to
no
purpose
,
he
be
fain
to
pawn
some
of
his
cloath
,
which
raise
him
a
small
sum
,
wherewith
he
bribe
the
s####t####y
,
who
soon
procure
a
warrant
for
him
,
notwithstanding
<EOS>
he
have
affirm
the
same
day
,
that
there
be
not
one
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
go
on
board
,
where
he
remain
nine
month
;
at
the
end
of
which
the
ship
be
put
out
of
commission
,
and
the
company
to
be
pay
off
in
Broad
-
street
the
very
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
that
his
relation
be
reconcil'd
to
him
,
have
charg'd
him
to
pay
his
devoirs
regularly
to
Mr
Cringer
,
who
have
inform
them
by
letter
,
that
his
interest
alone
have
procure
the
warrant
;
in
obedience
to
which
command
,
he
come
to
his
levee
every
morning
as
I
see
,
though
he
look
upon
him
to
be
a
very
pitiful
scoundrel
 
<EOS>
in
conclusion
,
he
ask
me
if
I
have
yet
pass
at
Surgeon's
-
Hall
?
<EOS>
to
which
I
answer
,
I
do
not
so
much
as
know
<EOS>
it
be
necessary
 
"
necessary
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
o
lord
,
o
lord
!
<EOS>
I
find
I
must
instruct
you
 
come
along
with
me
,
and
I
will
give
you
some
information
about
that
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
carry
me
into
an
ale
-
house
,
where
he
call
for
some
beer
and
bread
and
cheese
,
on
which
we
breakfast
.
<EOS>
while
we
sit
in
this
place
,
he
tell
me
I
must
first
go
to
the
Navy
-
Office
,
and
write
to
the
board
,
desire
them
to
order
a
letter
for
me
to
the
Surgeon's
-
Hall
,
that
I
may
be
examine
touch
my
skill
in
surgery
:
    
that
the
Surgeons
,
after
have
examine
me
,
would
give
me
my
qualification
seal
up
in
form
of
a
letter
direct
to
the
commissioner
,
which
qualification
I
must
deliver
to
the
secretary
of
the
board
,
who
would
open
it
in
my
presence
,
and
read
the
content
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
I
must
employ
my
interest
to
be
provide
for
as
soon
as
possible
 
<EOS>
that
the
expence
of
his
qualification
for
second
mate
of
a
third
rate
,
amount
to
thirteen
shilling
,
exclusive
of
the
warrant
,
which
cost
him
half
a
guinea
and
half
a
crown
,
besides
the
present
to
the
secretary
,
which
consist
of
a
three
pound
twelve
piece
.
 
<EOS>
this
calculation
be
like
a
thunder
-
bolt
to
me
,
whose
whole
fortune
do
not
amount
to
twelve
shilling
 
<EOS>
I
accordingly
make
him
acquaint
with
this
part
of
my
distress
,
after
have
thank
him
for
his
information
and
advice
.
 
<EOS>
He
condole
with
me
on
this
occasion
;
but
bid
me
be
of
good
chear
,
for
he
have
conceive
a
friendship
for
me
,
and
would
make
all
thing
easy
.
 
<EOS>
'
tis
true
he
be
run
out
at
present
,
but
to
-
morrow
or
next
day
,
he
be
certain
of
receive
a
considerable
sum
;
of
which
he
would
lend
me
what
would
be
sufficient
to
answer
my
exigence
.
<EOS>
this
frank
declaration
please
me
so
much
,
that
I
pull
out
my
purse
and
empty
it
before
him
,
beg
him
to
take
what
he
please
for
pocket
expence
until
he
should
receive
his
own
money
.
     
<EOS>
with
a
good
deal
of
press
he
be
prevail
upon
to
take
five
shilling
,
tell
me
that
he
may
have
what
money
he
please
at
any
time
,
for
the
trouble
of
go
into
the
city
;
but
as
he
have
meet
with
me
,
he
would
defer
his
go
thither
till
to
-
morrow
,
when
I
should
go
along
with
him
,
and
he
would
put
me
in
a
way
of
act
for
myself
,
without
a
servile
dependance
on
that
rascal
Cringer
,
much
less
on
the
lousy
taylor
to
whom
I
hear
him
turn
you
over
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
(
cry
I
)
be
Mr
Staytape
a
taylor
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
less
,
I
will
assure
you
(
<EOS>
answer'd
he
)
and
I
confess
,
more
likely
to
serve
you
than
the
member
:
<EOS>
for
provide
you
can
entertain
him
with
politic
and
conundrum
,
you
may
have
credit
with
him
for
as
many
and
as
rich
cloath
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
be
utterly
ignorant
of
both
,
and
so
incens'd
<EOS>
at
Cringer
's
usage
,
that
I
would
never
set
my
foot
within
his
door
again
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
good
deal
more
conversation
,
my
new
acquaintance
and
I
part
,
have
make
an
appointment
to
meet
next
day
at
the
same
place
,
in
order
to
set
out
for
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
immediately
to
Strap
,
and
relate
every
thing
which
have
happen'd
,
but
he
do
not
at
all
approve
of
my
be
so
forward
to
lend
money
to
a
stranger
,
especially
as
we
have
be
already
so
much
impos'd
upon
by
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
(
say
he
)
if
you
be
sure
he
be
a
Scotchman

I
believe
you
be
safe

<EOS>
My
new
acquaintance
break
an
appointment
 
I
proceed
,
by
myself
,
to
the
Navy
-
Office
 
address
myself
to
a
person
there
,
who
assist
me
with
his
advice
 
<EOS>
I
write
to
the
board
 
<EOS>
they
grant
me
a
letter
to
the
Surgeons
at
the
Hall
 
<EOS>
I
be
inform'd
of
the
beau
's
name
and
character
 
<EOS>
I
find
him
 
<EOS>
he
make
me
his
confident
in
an
amour
 
desire
me
to
pawn
my
linen
,
for
his
occasion
 
I
recover
what
I
lend
him
 
some
curious
observation
of
Strap
on
that
occasion
 
his
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
I
get
up
and
go
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
I
wait
two
hour
in
vain
;
and
be
so
exasperate
against
him
for
break
his
appointment
,
that
I
set
out
for
the
city
by
myself
,
in
hope
of
find
the
villain
,
and
be
reveng'd
on
him
for
his
perfidy
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
find
myself
at
the
Navy
-
Office
,
which
I
enter
,
and
see
crowd
of
young
fellow
walk
below
;
many
of
whom
make
no
well
appearance
than
myself
 
<EOS>
I
consult
the
physiognomy
of
each
,
and
at
last
make
up
to
one
whose
countenance
I
lik'd
;
and
ask'd
,
if
he
could
instruct
me
in
the
form
of
the
letter
which
be
to
be
send
to
the
board
,
to
obtain
an
order
for
examination
:
    
<EOS>
He
answer
me
in
broad
Scotch
,
that
he
would
shew
me
the
copy
of
what
he
have
write
for
himself
,
by
the
direction
of
another
who
know
the
form
:
and
accordingly
pull
it
out
of
his
pocket
for
my
perusal
;
and
tell
me
,
that
if
I
be
expeditious
,
I
may
send
it
in
to
the
board
before
dinner
,
for
they
do
no
business
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
then
go
with
me
to
a
coffee
-
house
hard
by
,
where
I
write
the
letter
,
which
be
immediately
deliver
to
the
messenger
;
who
tell
me
,
I
may
expect
an
order
to
-
morrow
about
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
have
transact
this
piece
of
business
,
my
mind
be
a
good
deal
compos'd
;
and
as
I
have
meet
with
so
much
civility
from
this
stranger
,
I
desire
further
acquaintance
with
him
,
fully
resolve
however
,
not
to
be
deceive
by
him
so
much
to
my
prejudice
as
I
have
be
by
the
beau
 
<EOS>
He
agree
to
dine
with
me
at
the
cook
's
shop
which
I
frequent
;
and
on
our
way
thither
,
carry
me
to
"
change
,
where
I
be
in
some
hope
of
find
Mr
Jackson
(
for
that
be
the
name
of
the
person
who
have
break
his
appointment
)
 
<EOS>
I
seek
him
there
to
no
purpose
,
and
on
our
way
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
impart
to
my
companion
his
behaviour
towards
me
:
upon
which
,
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
be
no
stranger
to
the
name
of
beau
Jackson
<EOS>
(
so
he
be
call
at
the
Navy
-
Office
)
<EOS>
altho
'
<EOS>
he
do
not
know
him
personally
;
that
he
have
the
character
of
a
good
-
natur'd
careless
fellow
,
who
make
no
scruple
of
borrow
from
any
body
that
would
lend
;
that
most
people
who
know
him
,
believe
he
have
a
good
enough
principle
at
the
bottom
;
but
his
extravagance
be
such
,
he
would
probably
never
have
it
in
his
power
to
manifest
the
honesty
of
his
intention
.
     
<EOS>
this
account
make
me
sweet
for
my
five
shilling
,
which
I
nevertheless
do
not
altogether
despair
of
recovering
,
provide
I
could
find
out
the
debtor
.
 
<EOS>
this
young
man
likewise
add
another
circumstance
of
"
Squire
Jackson
's
history
,
which
be
,
that
be
destitute
of
all
mean
to
equip
him
for
sea
,
when
he
receiv'd
his
last
warrant
,
he
have
be
recommend
to
a
person
who
lend
him
a
little
money
,
after
he
have
sign
a
will
and
power
,
entitle
that
person
to
lift
his
wage
when
they
should
become
due
,
as
also
to
inherit
his
effect
in
case
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
be
still
under
the
tutorage
and
direction
of
that
gentleman
,
who
advance
him
small
sum
from
time
to
time
upon
this
security
,
at
the
rate
of
50
per
cent
.
<EOS>
but
at
present
his
credit
be
very
low
,
because
his
fund
would
do
little
more
than
pay
what
he
have
already
receiv'd
;
this
moderate
interest
include
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
stranger
(
whose
name
be
Thomson
)
have
entertain'd
me
with
this
account
of
Jackson
,
he
inform'd
me
,
that
he
himself
have
pass
for
a
third
mate
of
a
third
rate
,
about
four
month
ago
;
since
which
time
,
he
have
constantly
attend
at
the
Navy
-
Office
,
in
hope
of
a
warrant
,
have
be
assur'd
from
the
beginning
,
both
by
a
Scotch
member
and
one
of
the
commissioner
to
whom
the
member
recommend
him
,
that
he
should
be
put
into
the
first
vacancy
;
notwithstanding
which
promise
,
he
have
have
the
mortification
to
see
six
or
seven
appoint
in
the
same
station
almost
every
week
 
that
now
be
utterly
impoverish'd
<EOS>
,
his
sole
hope
consist
in
the
promise
of
a
friend
<EOS>
lately
come
to
town
,
to
lend
him
a
small
matter
,
for
a
present
to
the
f####t####y
;
without
which
he
be
persuade
he
may
wait
a
thousand
year
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
conceive
a
mighty
liking
for
this
young
fellow
,
which
(
I
believe
)
proceed
from
the
similitude
of
our
fortune
:
    
<EOS>
We
spend
the
whole
day
together
;
and
as
he
live
at
wapping
,
I
desir'd
him
to
take
a
share
of
my
bed
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
we
return
to
the
Navy
-
Office
,
where
,
after
be
call
before
the
board
and
question'd
about
the
place
of
my
nativity
and
education
,
they
order'd
a
letter
to
be
make
out
for
me
,
which
,
upon
pay
half
a
crown
to
the
clerk
,
I
receiv'd
,
and
deliver'd
into
the
hand
of
the
clerk
at
Surgeon's
-
Hall
,
together
with
a
shilling
for
his
trouble
in
register
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
my
whole
stock
be
diminish
to
two
shilling
,
and
I
see
not
the
least
prospect
of
relief
,
even
for
present
subsistence
,
much
less
to
enable
me
to
pay
the
fee
at
Surgeon
's
 
Hall
for
my
examination
,
which
be
to
happen
in
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
perplexity
,
I
consult
Strap
,
who
assure
me
,
he
would
pawn
every
thing
he
have
in
the
world
,
even
to
his
razor
,
before
I
should
want
:
but
this
I
absolutely
reject
,
tell
him
,
I
would
a
thousand
time
rather
list
for
a
soldier
,
of
which
I
have
some
thought
,
than
be
any
longer
a
burthen
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
word
soldier
,
he
grow
pale
as
death
,
and
beg
on
his
knee
,
I
would
think
no
more
of
that
scheme
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
preserve
us
all
in
our
right
wit
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
would
you
turn
soldier
,
and
perhaps
be
send
abroad
against
the
Spaniards
,
where
you
must
stand
and
be
shoot
at
like
a
woodcock
?
 
<EOS>
Heaven
keep
cold
lead
out
of
my
carcass
!
<EOS>
and
let
me
die
in
a
bed
like
a
christian
,
as
all
my
fore
-
father
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
what
signify
all
the
rich
and
honour
of
this
life
,
if
one
enjoy
not
content
 
and
in
the
next
,
there
be
no
respect
of
person
.
<EOS>
well
be
a
poor
honest
Barber
with
a
good
conscience
,
and
time
to
repent
of
my
sin
upon
my
death
bed
,
than
be
cut
off
(
God
bless
us
)
by
a
musket
shot
,
as
it
be
in
the
very
flower
of
one
's
age
,
in
the
pursuit
of
rich
and
fame
.
 
<EOS>
what
signify
rich
(
my
dear
friend
!
)
<EOS>
do
they
not
make
unto
themselves
wing
,
as
the
wise
-
man
saith
;
and
do
not
horace
observe
,
"
<EOS>
Non
domus
aut

,
non

acervus
aut
auri
Aegroto
domini
deduxit

febrem
,
non

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
moreover
mention
many
other
saying
in
contempt
of
rich
,
both
from
the
bible
and
other
good
book
;
but
as
I
know
you
be
not
very
fond
of
these
thing
,
I
shall
only
assure
you
,
that
if
you
take
on
to
be
a
soldier
,
I
will
do
the
same
;
and
then
if
we
should
both
be
slay
,
you
will
not
only
have
your
own
blood
to
answer
for
,
but
mine
also
:
and
peradventure
the
life
of
all
those
whom
we
shall
kill
in
battle
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
pray
you
,
consider
whether
you
will
sit
down
contented
with
small
thing
,
and
share
the
fruit
of
my
industry
in
peace
,
"
till
providence
shall
send
well
tiding
;
or
by
your
despair
,
plunge
both
our
soul
and
body
into
everlasting
perdition
,
which
God
of
his
infinite
mercy
forbid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smile
at
this
harangue
,
which
be
deliver
with
great
earnestness
,
the
tear
stand
in
his
eye
all
the
time
;
and
promise
to
do
nothing
of
that
sort
without
his
consent
and
concurrence
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
much
comfort
with
this
declaration
;
and
tell
me
,
in
a
few
day
he
should
receive
a
week
's
wage
which
should
be
at
my
service
,
but
advise
me
in
the
mean
time
,
to
go
in
quest
of
Jackson
,
and
recover
,
if
possible
,
what
he
have
borrow'd
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
accordingly
trudg'd
about
from
one
end
of
the
town
to
the
other
,
for
several
day
,
without
be
able
to
learn
any
thing
certain
concern
him
:
<EOS>
and
,
one
day
,
be
extreamly
hungry
and
allur'd
by
the
steam
that
regal'd
my
nostril
from
a
boiling
cellar
,
I
go
down
with
an
intention
to
gratify
my
appetite
with
two
-
penny
worth
of
beef
;
when
,
to
my
no
small
surprize
,
I
find
Mr
Jackson
sit
at
dinner
with
a
footman
.
 
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
no
sooner
perceiv'd
me
than
he
get
up
,
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
,
say
,
"
He
be
glad
to
see
me
,
for
he
intend
to
have
call'd
<EOS>
at
my
lodging
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
well
pleas'd
with
this
rencounter
,
and
the
apology
he
make
for
not
keep
his
appointment
,
that
I
forget
my
resentment
,
and
sit
down
to
dinner
,
with
the
happy
expectation
of
not
only
recover
my
own
money
before
we
should
part
,
but
also
reap
the
benefit
of
his
promise
to
lend
me
wherewithal
to
pass
examination
;
and
this
my
sanguine
complexion
suggest
,
notwithstanding
the
account
Thompson
give
me
of
him
,
ought
to
have
teach
me
better
.
     
<EOS>
when
we
have
feast
sumptuously
,
he
take
his
leave
of
the
footman
,
and
adjourn
with
me
to
an
ale
-
house
hard
by
,
<EOS>
where
after
shake
me
by
the
hand
again
,
he
begin
thus
,
"
I
suppose
you
think
me
a
sad
dog
,
Mr
Random
,
and
I
do
confess
that
appearance
be
against
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
you
will
forgive
me
when
I
tell
you
,
my
not
come
at
the
time
appoint
,
be
owe
to
a
peremptory
message
,
I
receiv'd
from
a
certain
lady
,
whom
 
harkee
<EOS>
(
but
this
be
a
great
secret
)
<EOS>
I
be
to
marry
very
soon

You
think
this
strange
perhaps
,
but
it
be
not
less
true
for
all
that
 
a
five
thousand
pounder
<EOS>
,
I

she
can

all

and
indeed
be
so

of

that
to
be

he
seem
to

,
rub
his

,

of

It

let

in

I
shall

for

I

,

no

you

some
post

lie
out
my

fortune
in

,
and
retire
to

country
at

<EOS>
"
I
give
my
opinion
without
hesitation
,
that
he
could
not
do
better
than
buy
an
estate
and
improve
it
;
especially
since
he
have
already
see
so
much
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
then
I
launch'd
out
into
the
praise
of
a
country
life
,
as
describ'd
by
the
poet
whose
work
I
have
read
 
He
seem'd
to
relish
my
advice
,
but
withal
tell
me
,
that
although
he
have
see
a
great
deal
of
the
world
both
at
land
and
sea
,
have
cruiz'd
three
whole
month
in
the
channel
,
yet
he
should
not
be
satisfied
until
he
have
visit
France
,
which
he
propos'd
to
do
before
he
should
settle
;
and
to
carry
his
wife
along
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
object
to
his
proposal
;
and
ask'd
him
,
how
soon
he
hop'd
to
be
happy
.
     
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
(
reply
he
)
<EOS>
nothing
obstruct
my
happiness
,
but
the
want
of
a
little
ready
cash
 
for
you
must
know
,
my
friend
in

have
go
out

and
I
unfortunately
miss
my

by

there

I

if
that

there
be

there
be

<EOS>
you

I
acquiesc'd
in

enquir'd
how
he
intend
to
proceed

at

he
<EOS>
rubb'd
his

,
"

I
<EOS>
assur'd

him

I
be
such
an

that
I

<EOS>
how
many

I
answer'd
,
"
six
ruffle

six
plain

<EOS>
at
which
he
testify

than

Mr

<EOS>
He
protest
he

not

shill
in

that
he
would
pay
me
out
of

from

<EOS>
this
piece

assurance
incense
me

I

I

I

as
for

I
would
not

one
of
them
to
save
him
from

gallow

<EOS>
at
this
expression
he
laugh
aloud
,
and
then
complain
,
it
be
damn
hard
,
that
I
should
refuse
him
a
trifle
,
that
would
infallibly
enable
him
not

to
make
his

mine
also

You
talk

here
several

since
I
believe
the

to

will
redeem

he
shall
have

yesterday

so
much

I
slice
a

he
swear
a
deadly
oath

be
go

prevent

make

haud

<EOS>
be
not

barber
as
good

<EOS>
the
only
difference
be
,
the
baker
use
flour
for
the
belly
,
and
the
barber
use
it
for
the
head
:
and
as
the
head
be
a
more
noble
member

the
belly

so
be
a
barber
more
noble
than
a

for
what
be
the
belly
without
the
head

<EOS>
besides
,
I
be
tell
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
;
now
you
know
I
can
do
both
:

moreover
speak
Latin

no

I
despise
vanity

<EOS>
with
these
word
he
pull
out
of
his
pocket
a
wax
candle
's
end
,
which
he
apply
to
his
forehead
;
and
upon
examination
,
I
find
he
have
comb
his
own
hair
over
the
toupee
of
his
wig
,
and
be
indeed
in
his
whole
dress
become
a
very

shaver

I
congratulate
him
on
his
prospect
with
a
satirical
smile
,
which
he
understand
very
well
;
and
shake
his
head
,

observe
I
have
very

with
the
assistance
of
this
faithful
adherent

who
give
me
almost
all
the
money
he

,
I
preserve
my
half
guinea
entire
,
till
the
day
of
examination
,
when
I
go
with
a
tremble
heart
to
Surgeon's

hall

in

to
undergo
that
ceremony

<EOS>
among

of
young

walk
in

outward
hall

I
perceive
Mr

to

immediately
go
up

enquire
into
the
state
of
his
amour
,
understand
it
be
still
undetermine
by
reason
of
his
friend
's
absence
,
and
the
delay
of
the
recal
at
Chatham
,
which
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
bring
it
to
a
conclusion

I
then
ask
what
his
business
be
in
this
place
;
to
which
he
reply
,
he
be
resolve
to
have
two
string
to
his
bow
,
that
in
case
the
one
fail
he
may
use
the
other
;
and
with
this
view
,
he
be
to
pass
that
night
for
a
high
qualification
.
     
<EOS>
at
that
instant
a
young
fellow
come
out
from
the
place
of
examination
,
with
a
pale
countenance
,
his
lip
quiver
,
and
his
look
as
wild
as
if
he
have
see
a
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
appear
,
than
we
all
flock
about
him
with
the
utmost
eagerness
to
know
what
reception
he
have
meet
with
;
which
(
after
some
pause
)
he
describe
,
recount
all
the
question
they
have
ask
,
with
the
answer
he
make
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
we
oblige
no
less
than
twelve
to
recapitulate
,
which
,
now
the
danger
be
past
,
they
do
with
pleasure
,
before
it
fall
to
my
lot
:
<EOS>
at
length
the
beadle
call
my
name
,
with
a
voice
that
make
me
tremble
,
as
much
as
if
it
have
be
the
last
trumpet
:
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
remedy
,
I
be
conduct
into
a
large
hall
,
where
I
see
about
a
dozen
of
grim
face
sit
at
a
long
table
.
<EOS>
one
of
whom
bid
me
come
forward
in
such
an
imperious
tone
,
that
I
be
actually
for
a
minute
or
two
bereft
of
my
sense
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
question
he
put
to
me
be
,
"
where
be
you
bear
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
I
answer
,
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
Scotland
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
know
that
very
well
 
<EOS>
we
have
scarce
any
other
countryman
to
examine
here
 
<EOS>
you
Scotchmen
have
overspread
us
of
late
as
the
locust
do
Egypt
:
 
<EOS>
I
ask
you
in
what
part
of
Scotland
be
you
bear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
name
the
place
of
my
nativity
,
which
he
have
never
before
hear
of
:
    
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
interrogate
me
about
my
age
,
the
town
where
I
serve
my
time
,
with
the
term
of
my
apprenticeship
;
and
when
I
have
inform
him
that
I
serve
three
year
only
,
he
fall
into
a
violent
passion
;
swear
it
be
a
shame
and
a
scandal
to
send
such
raw
boy
into
the
world
as
surgeon
;
that
it
be
great
presumption
in
me
,
and
an
affront
upon
the
English
,
to
pretend
to
sufficient
skill
in
my
business
,
have
serve
so
short
a
time
,
when
every
apprentice
in
England
be
bind
seven
year
at
least
;
 
that
my
friend
have
do
better
if
they
have
make
me
a
weaver
or
shoemaker
,
but
their
pride
would
have
me
a
gentleman
(
he
suppose
)
at
any
rate
,
and
their
poverty
could
not
afford
the
necessary
education
.
 
<EOS>
this
exordium
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
recovery
of
my
spirit
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
reduce
me
to
such
a
situation
that
I
be
scarce
able
to
stand
;
which
be
perceive
by
a
plump
gentleman
,
who
sit
opposite
to
me
,
with
a
skull
before
him
,
he
say
Mr
Snarler
be
too
severe
upon
the
young
man
;
and
turn
towards
me
,
tell
me
,
I
need
not
be
afraid
,
for
no
body
would
do
me
any
harm
;
then
bid
me
take
time
to
recollect
myself
<EOS>
,
he
examine
me
touch
the
operation
of
the
trepan
,
and
be
very
well
satisfied
with
my
answer
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
person
who
question
me
be
a
wag
,
who
begin
by
ask
me
if
I
have
ever
see
amputation
perform
;
to
which
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
he
shake
his
head
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
upon
a
dead
subject
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
if
(
continue
he
)
during
an
engagement
at
sea
,
a
man
should
be
bring
to
you
with
his
head
shoot
off
,
how
would
you
behave
?
"
 
<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
,
I
own
,
such
a
case
have
never
come
under
my
observation
;
neither
do
I
remember
to
have
see
any
method
of
cure
propose
for
such
an
accident
,
in
any
of
the
system
of
surgery
I
have
peruse
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
owe
to
the
simplicity
of
my
answer
,
or
the
archness
of
the
question
,
I
know
not
,
but
every
member
at
the
board
deign
to
smile
,
except
Mr
Snarler
,
who
seem
to
have
very
little
of
the
animal
risibile
in
his
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
the
facetious
member
,
encourage
by
the
success
of
his
last
joke
,
go
on
thus
:
"
<EOS>
suppose
you
be
call
to
a
patient
of
a
plethoric
habit
,
who
have
be
bruise
by
a
fall
,
what
would
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
I
would
bleed
him
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
(
say
he
)
before
you
tie
up
his
arm
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
this
stroke
of
wit
not
answer
his
expectation
,
he
desire
me
to
advance
to
the
gentleman
who
sit
next
him
;
and
who
with
a
pert
air
,
ask
what
method
of
cure
I
would
follow
in
wound
of
the
intestine
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
method
of
cure
as
it
be
prescribe
by
the
good
chirurgical
writer
;
which
he
hear
to
an
end
,
and
then
say
with
a
supercilious
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
you
think
with
such
treatment
the
patient
may
recover
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
see
nothing
to
make
me
think
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
(
resume
he
)
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
for
your
foresight
;
 
but
do
you
ever
know
a
case
of
this
kind
succeed
?
<EOS>
"
I
acknowledge
I
do
not
;
and
be
about
to
tell
him
I
have
never
see
a
wound
intestine
;
but
he
stopt
me
,
by
say
with
some
precipitation
,
"
nor
never
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
affirm
,
that
all
wound
of
the
intestine
,
whether
great
or
small
,
be
mortal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
brother
(
say
the
fat
gentleman
)
<EOS>
there
be
very
good
authority
"
 
here
he
be
interrupt
by
the
other
,
with
"
Sir
,
excuse
me
,
I
despise
all
authority
.
 
<EOS>
Nullius
in
verba
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
upon
my
own
bottom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
Sir
,
Sir
,
(
reply
his
antagonist
)
<EOS>
the
reason
of
the
thing
shew
"
 
"
a
fig
for
reason
(
cry
this
sufficient
member
)
<EOS>
I
laugh
at
reason
,
give
me
ocular
demonstration
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
the
corpulent
gentleman
begin
to
wax
warm
,
and
observe
that
no
man
acquaint
with
the
anatomy
of
the
part
,
would
advance
such
an
extravagant
assertion
.
 
<EOS>
this
inuendo
enrage
the
other
so
much
,
that
he
start
up
,
and
in
a
furious
tone
exclaim
:
"
<EOS>
what
Sir
!
<EOS>
do
you
question
my
knowledge
in
anatomy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
all
the
examiner
have
espouse
the
opinion
of
one
or
other
of
the
disputant
,
and
raise
their
voice
all
together
,
when
the
chairman
command
silence
and
order
me
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
I
be
call
in
again
,
and
receive
my
qualification
seal
up
,
and
be
order
to
pay
five
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
down
my
half
-
guinea
upon
the
table
,
and
stand
some
time
,
until
one
of
them
bid
me
begone
;
to
this
I
reply
,
<EOS>
I
will
,
when
I
have
get
my
change
;
upon
which
another
throw
me
five
shilling
and
six
-
pence
,
say
,
I
would
not
be
a
true
Scotchman
if
I
go
away
without
my
change
.
<EOS>
I
be
afterwards
oblige
to
give
three
shilling
and
six
-
pence
to
the
beadle
,
and
a
shilling
to
an
old
woman
who
sweep
the
hall
:
this
disbursement
sink
my
finance
to
thirteen
penny
half
-
penny
,
with
which
I
be
sneak
off
,
when
Jackson
perceive
it
,
come
up
to
me
,
and
beg
I
would
tarry
for
him
and
he
would
accompany
me
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
as
soon
as
his
examination
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
refuse
this
to
a
person
that
be
so
much
my
friend
;
but
I
be
astonish
at
the
change
of
his
dress
,
which
be
vary
in
half
an
hour
from
what
I
have
already
describe
,
to
a
very
grotesque
fashion
.
     
<EOS>
His
head
be
cover
with
an
old
smoake
tye
-
wig
that
do
not
boast
one
crooked
hair
,
and
a
sloutched
hat
over
it
,
which
would
have
very
well
become
a
chimney
-
sweeper
or
a
dust
-
man
;
 
his
neck
be
adorn
with
a
black
crape
,
the
end
of
which
he
have
twist
,
and
fix
in
the
button
-
hole
of
a
shabby
great
coat
that
wrap
up
his
whole
body
;
his
white
silk
stocking
be
convert
into
black
worsted
hose
;
and
his
countenance
be
render
venerable
by
wrinkles
,
and
a
beard
of
his
own
painting
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
express
my
surprize
at
this
metamorphosis
,
he
laugh
,
and
tell
me
,
it
be
do
by
the
advice
and
assistance
of
a
friend
who
live
over
the
way
,
and
would
certainly
produce
something
very
much
to
his
advantage
;
for
it
give
him
the
appearance
of
age
,
which
never
fail
of
attract
respect
.
<EOS>
I
applaud
his
sagacity
,
and
wait
with
impatience
,
for
the
effect
of
it
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
be
call
in
,
but
whether
the
oddness
of
his
appearance
excite
a
curiosity
more
than
usual
in
the
board
,
or
his
behaviour
be
not
suitable
to
his
figure
,
I
know
not
,
he
be
discover
to
be
an
impostor
,
and
put
into
the
hand
of
the
beadle
,
in
order
to
be
send
to
Bridewell
.
<EOS>
so
that
instead
of
see
him
come
out
with
a
chearful
countenance
,
and
a
surgeon
's
qualification
in
his
hand
,
I
perceive
him
lead
through
the
outward
hall
as
a
prisoner
;
and
be
very
much
alarmed
and
anxious
to
know
the
occasion
;
when
he
call
with
a
lamentable
voice
and
piteous
aspect
,
to
me
,
and
some
other
who
know
him
;
"
for
God
's
sake
,
gentleman
,
bear
witness
that
I
be
the
same
individual
John
Jackson
,
who
serve
as
surgeon
's
second
mate
on
board
the
Elizabeth
,
or
else
I
shall
go
to
Bridewell
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
impossible
for
the
most
austere
hermit
that
ever
live
,
to
have
refrain
from
laugh
at
his
appearance
and
address
;
we
therefore
indulge
ourselves
a
good
while
at
his
expence
,
and
afterwards
plead
his
cause
so
effectually
with
the
beadle
,
who
be
gratify
with
half
a
crown
,
that
the
prisoner
be
dismiss
;
and
in
a
few
moment
resume
his
former
gaiety
;
 
swearing
,
since
the
board
have
refuse
his
money
,
he
would
spend
it
every
shilling
before
he
go
to
bed
in
treat
his
friend
;
at
the
same
time
invite
us
all
to
favour
him
with
our
company
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
and
as
I
have
a
great
way
to
walk
in
a
town
where
I
be
a
stranger
,
I
be
prevail
upon
to
be
of
their
party
,
<EOS>
in
hope
he
would
afterwards
accompany
me
to
my
lodging
,
which
he
faithfully
promise
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
us
to
his
friend
's
house
,
who
keep
a
tavern
over
the
way
,
where
we
remain
drink
punch
,
until
the
liquor
mount
up
to
our
head
,
and
make
us
all
extremely
frolicksome
:
<EOS>
I
,
in
particular
be
so
much
elevated
,
that
nothing
would
serve
me
but
a
wench
,
at
which
Jackson
express
much
joy
,
and
assure
me
I
should
have
my
desire
before
we
part
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
he
have
pay
the
reckoning
we
sally
out
,
roar
and
singing
;
and
be
conduct
by
our
leader
to
a
place
of
nocturnal
entertainment
,
where
I
immediately
attach
myself
to
a
fair
one
,
with
whom
I
propose
to
spend
the
remain
part
of
the
night
;
but
she
not
relish
my
appearance
,
refuse
to
grant
my
request
before
I
have
make
her
an
acknowledgment
,
which
not
suit
my
circumstance
we
break
off
our
correspondence
,
to
my
no
small
mortification
and
resentment
,
because
I
think
the
mercenary
creature
have
not
do
justice
to
my
merit
.
     
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Mr
Jackson
's
dress
have
attract
the
inclination
and
assiduity
of
two
or
three
nymph
,
who
load
him
with
caress
,
in
return
for
the
arrack
punch
with
which
he
treat
them
;
till
at
length
,
notwithstanding
the
sprightly
sally
of
these
charmer
,
sleep
begin
to
exert
his
power
over
us
all

and
our
conductor
call

to

<EOS>
when
the
bill
be
bring
,
which
amount
to
twelve
shilling

he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
but
may
have
save
himself
the
trouble
,
for
his
purse
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
this
accident
disconcert
him
a
good
deal
at
first
,
but
after
some
recollection
he
seize
the
two
Dulcineas
,
who
sit
by
him
,
one
in
each
hand
;
and
swear
if
they
do
not
immediately
restore
his
money
,
he
would
charge
a
constable
with
them

<EOS>
the
good
lady
at
the
bar
see
what
pass

whisper
something
to
the
drawer

who
go
out

then
with
great
composure

ask
what
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Jackson
tell
her
he
be
rob
,
and
if
she
refuse
him
satisfaction
,
he
would
have
her
and
her
whore
commit
to
Bridewell

Jackson
,
who
have
be
often
in
such
scrape
be
very
little
concerned
,
and
charge
the
constable
in
his
turn
,
with
the
landlady
and
her
whole
bevy
:
upon
which
we
be
carry
all
together
prisoner
to
the
round
-
house
;
where
Jackson
(
after
a
word
of
comfort
to
us
)
inform
the
constable
of
his
be
rob
,
to
which
he
say
he
would
swear
next
morning
before
the
justice
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
(
say
the
bawd
)
<EOS>
we
shall
see
whose
oath
will
most
signify
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
the
constable
call
Jackson
into
another
room
,
speak
to
him
thus
:
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
that
you
and
your
company
be
stranger
,
and
be
very
sorry
for
your
be
involve
in
such
an
ugly
business
as
this
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
this
woman
a
great
while
;
she
have
keep
a
notorious
house
in
the
neighbourhood
these
many
year
;
and
although
often
complain
of
as
a
nuisance
,
still
escape
thro
'
her
interest
with
the
j####t####ce
,
to
whom
she
and
all
of
her
employment
,
pay
contribution
quarterly
for
protection
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
charge
me
with
you
first
,
her
complaint
will
have
the
preference
,
and
she
can
procure
evidence
to
swear
whatever
she
shall
please
to
desire
them
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
unless
you
make
it
up
before
morning
,
you
and
your
companion
may
think
yourself
happily
quit
for
a
month
's
hard
labour
in
Bridewell
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
she
should
swear
a
robbery
or
assault
against
you
,
you
will
be
commit
to
Newgate
,
and
try
next
session
at
the
Old
-
Baily
for
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
this
last
piece
of
information
have
such
an
effect
upon
Jackson
,
that
he
agree
to
make
it
up
,
provide
his
money
may
be
rest
red
:
    
<EOS>
the
constable
tell
him
,
that
instead
of
restore
what
they
have
stol'n
,
he
be
pretty
certain
,
it
would
cost
him
some
more
before
they
would
come
to
any
composition
.
 
<EOS>
but
however
,
he
have
compassion
on
him
,
and
would
,
if
he
please
,
sound
them
about
a
mutual
release
.
 
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
beau
thank
him
for
his
friendship
,
and
return
to
us
,
where
he
acquaint
us
with
the
substance
of
this
dialogue
;
while
the
constable
desiring
to
speak
in
private
with
our
adversary
,
carry
her
into
the
next
room
,
and
plead
our
cause
so
effectually
,
that
she
condescend
to
make
him
umpire
:
He
accordingly
propose
an
arbitration
,
to
which
we
give
our
assent
;
and
he
fine
each
party
in
three
shilling
to
be
lay
out
in
a
bowl
of
punch
,
wherein
we
drown
all
animosity
,
to
the
inexpressible
joy
of
my
two
late
acquaintance
and
me
,
who
have
be
in
the
state
of
the
damned
ever
since
Jackson
mention
Bridewell
and
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
time
we
have
finish
our
bowl
,
to
which
,
by
the
by
,
I
have
contribute
my
last
shilling
,
it
be
morning
;
and
I
propose
to
move
homeward
,
when
the
constable
give
me
to
understand
,
he
could
discharge
no
prisoner
but
by
order
of
the
justice
,
before
whom
we
must
appear
.
 
<EOS>
this
renew
my
regret
,
and
I
curse
the
hour
in
which
I
have
yield
to
Jackson
's
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
about
nine
a

clock
<EOS>
we
be
escort
to
the
house
of
a
certain

not
many
mile
distant
from
Covent

Garden
;
who
no
sooner
see
the
constable
enter
with
a
train
of
prisoner
at
his
heel
,
than
he
salute
him
as
follow
:
"

Mr
Constable
,
you
be
a
diligent
man
 
what
den
of
rogue
have
you

then
look
at

who
appear
with
a
dejected

he
continue
,
"

to

<EOS>
lately

to
town

and
that

<EOS>
the
justice
look
upon
this
declaration
as
an
outrage
against
his
memory
,
on
which
he
value
himself
much
;
and
strut
up
to
Jackson

with
a
fierce
countenance

put
his

in
his

My

be
so
much
abash
at
this
menace

which
be
thunder
out
with
great
vociferation
,
that
he
change
colour

and
remain
speechless
 
<EOS>
this

take
for

of
guilt

<EOS>
I
be
in
an
agony
of
consternation
,
when
the

go
into
another

with
his

,
acquaint
him
with
the
truth
of
the
story

<EOS>
upon
which
he
return
with
a
smile
countenance
,
and
address
himself
to
us
all
,
say
,
it
be
always
his
way
to
terrify
young
people
,
when
they
come
before
him
,
that
his
threat
may
make
a
strong
impression
on
their
mind
,
and
deterr
them
from
engage
in
scene
of
riot
and
debauchery
which
commonly
end
before
the

<EOS>
thus
have
cloak
his
own
want
of
discernment
,
under
the
disguise
of
paternal
care
,
we
be
dismiss

chapter
XVIII
<EOS>
I
carry
my
qualification
to
the
navy
-
office
 
<EOS>
the
nature
of
it
 
<EOS>
the
behaviour
of
the
s####t####y
 
Strap
's
concern
for
my
absence
 
<EOS>
a
battle
betwixt
him
and
a
blacksmith
 
<EOS>
the
troublesome
consequence
of
it
 
<EOS>
his
harrangue
to
me
 
his
friend
the
school
-
master
recommend
me
to
a
french
apothecary
,
who
entertain
me
as
a
journeyman
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
have
go
home
to
sleep
,
but
be
tell
by
my
companion
,
that
we
must
deliver
our
letter
of
qualification
at
the
navy
-
office
before
one
a
-
clock
;
upon
which
we
repair
thither
,
and
give
them
to
the
s####t####y
,
who
open
and
read
them
,
and
I
be
mightily
pleased
to
find
myself
qualified
for
second
mate
of
a
third
rate
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
stick
them
all
together
on
a
file
,
one
of
our
company
ask
if
there
be
any
vacancy
;
to
which
he
answer
,
no
.
<EOS>
then
I
venture
to
enquire
if
any
ship
be
to
be
put
in
commission
soon
.
 
<EOS>
at
which
he
survey
me
with
a
look
of
ineffable
contempt
,
and
push
us
out
of
his
office
,
lock
the
door
without
deign
us
one
word
.
     
<EOS>
We
go
down
stair
and
confer
together
on
our
expectation
,
when
I
understand
that
each
of
them
have
be
recommend
to
one
or
other
of
the
commissioner
;
and
each
of
them
promise
the
first
vacancy
that
should
fall
;
but
that
none
of
them
rely
solely
upon
that
interest
,
without
a
present
to
the
s####t####y
,
with
whom
the
c####mm####rs
go
snack
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
reason
each
have
provide
a
small
purse
;
and
I
be
ask
what
I
propose
to
give
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
vexatious
question
to
me
,
who
(
so
far
from
be
in
a
capacity
to
gratify
a
ravenous
s####t####y
)
have
not
wherewithal
to
buy
me
a
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
answer
,
I
have
not
determine
yet
what
to
give
;
and
sneak
off
towards
my
own
lodging
,
curse
my
fate
all
the
way
,
and
inveigh
with
much
bitterness
against
the
barbarity
of
my
grandfather
,
and
the
sordid
avarice
of
my
relation
,
who
leave
me
a
prey
to
contempt
and
indigence
.
 
<EOS>
full
of
these
disagreeable
reflection
,
I
arrive
at
the
house
where
I
lodge
,
and
relieve
my
landlord
from
great
anxiety
on
my
account
;
for
this
honest
man
believe
I
have
meet
with
some
dismal
accident
,
and
that
he
should
never
see
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
Strap
,
who
have
be
to
see
me
in
the
morning
,
understanding
<EOS>
I
have
be
abroad
all
night
,
be
almost
distract
,
and
after
have
obtain
leave
of
his
master
,
have
go
in
quest
of
me
,
though
he
be
even
more
ignorant
of
the
town
than
I.
not
be
willing
to
inform
my
landlord
of
my
adventure
<EOS>
,
I
tell
him
,
I
have
meet
an
acquaintance
at
Surgeon's
-
hall
,
with
whom
I
spend
the
evening
and
night
,
but
be
very
much
infest
by
bug
,
I
have
not
sleep
much
,
and
therefore
intend
to
take
a
little
repose
;
<EOS>
so
say
,
I
go
to
bed
and
desire
to
be
awaken
if
Strap
happen
to
come
while
I
should
be
asleep
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
accordingly
rouse
by
my
friend
himself
,
who
enter
my
chamber
about
three
a
-
clock
in
the
afternoon
;
and
present
a
figure
to
my
eye
,
that
I
could
scarce
believe
real
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
affectionate
shaver
,
set
out
towards
Surgeon's
-
hall
,
have
enquire
for
me
there
to
no
purpose
;
from
thence
he
find
his
way
to
the
navy
-
office
,
where
he
he
could
hear
no
tiding
of
me
,
because
I
be
unknown
to
every
body
then
present
;
he
afterwards
go
upon
Change
in
hope
of
see
me
upon
the
Scotch
walk
;
but
without
any
success
:
at
last
<EOS>
,
be
almost
in
dispair
of
find
me
,
he
resolve
to
ask
every
body
he
meet
in
the
street
,
if
perchance
any
one
could
give
him
information
about
me
:
and
actually
put
his
resolution
in
practice
,
in
spite
of
the
scoff
,
curse
and
reproach
with
which
he
be
answer
;
until
a
blacksmith
's
"
prentice
,
see
him
stop
a
porter
with
a
burden
on
his
back
,
and
hear
his
question
,
for
which
he
receive
a
hearty
curse
,
call
to
him
,
and
ask
if
the
person
he
enquire
after
be
not
a
Scotchman
?
 
<EOS>
Strap
reply
with
great
eagerness
,
"
yes
,
and
have
on
a
brown
coat
with
long
skirt
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
same
(
say
the
blacksmith
)
<EOS>
I
see
him
pass
about
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
so
?
<EOS>
(
cry
Strap
,
rub
his
hand
)
<EOS>
Odd
!
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
of
that
 
<EOS>
which
way
go
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
towards
Tyburn
in
a
cart
,
(
say
he
)
if
you
make
good
speed
,
you
may
get
thith
time
enough
to
see
him
hang
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
piece
of
wit
incense
my
friend
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
call
the
blacksmith
scoundrel
,
and
protest
he
would
fight
him
for
half
a
farthing
 
"
no
,
no
,
(
say
the
other
,
strip
)
<EOS>
I
will
have
none
of
your
money
 
<EOS>
you
Scotchmen
seldom
carry
any
about
you
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
fight
you
for
love
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
there
be
a
ring
immediately
form
by
the
mob
;
and
Strap
find
he
could
not
get
off
honourably
without
fight
,
at
the
same
time
burn
with
resentment
against
his
adversary
,
quit
his
cloath
to
the
care
of
the
multitude
,
and
the
battle
begin
with
great
violence
on
the
side
of
Strap
,
who
in
a
few
minute
exhaust
his
breath
and
spirit
on
his
patient
antagonist
,
who
sustain
the
assault
with
great
coolness
,
till
find
the
barber
quite
spend
,
he
return
the
blow
he
have
lend
him
,
with
such
interest
,
that
Strap
,
after
have
receive
three
fall
on
the
hard
stone
,
give
out
,
and
allow
the
blacksmith
to
be
the
well
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
victory
be
thus
decide
,
it
be
propose
to
adjourn
to
a
cellar
hard
by
and
drink
friend
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
my
friend
begin
to
gather
up
his
cloath
,
he
perceive
that
some
honest
person
or
other
have
make
free
with
his
shirt
,
neckcloath
,
hat
and
wig
,
which
be
carry
off
;
and
probably
his
coat
and
waistcoat
would
have
meet
with
the
same
fate
,
have
they
be
worth
the
stealing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
him
to
make
a
noise
,
which
only
yield
mirth
to
the
spectator
;
he
be
fain
to
get
off
in
this
manner
,
which
he
accomplish
with
much
difficulty
,
and
appear
before
me
,
all
besmear
with
blood
and
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
misfortune
,
such
be
his
transport
at
find
me
safe
and
sound
,
that
he
have
almost
stifle
and
stunk
me
to
death
with
his
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
after
he
have
clean
himself
and
put
on
one
of
my
shirt
,
and
a
woolen
night
-
cape
instead
of
hat
and
wig
;
I
recount
to
him
the
particular
of
my
night

campaign
,
which
fill
him
with
admiration
,
and
make
him
repeat
with
great
energy
an
observation
which
be
often
in
his
mouth
,
viz
.
"
<EOS>
London
be
the
devil
's
drawing
room
.
"
     
<EOS>
as
neither
of
us
have
dine
,
he
desire
me
to
get
up
,
and
the
milk
-
woman
come
round
at
that
instant
,
he
go
down
stair
and
bring
up
a
quart
,
with
a
penny
brick
,
on
which
we
make
a
comfortable
meal
.
<EOS>
He
then
share
his
money
with
me
,
which
amount
to
eighteen
-
penny
,
and
leave
me
,
with
an
intention
to
borrow
an
old
wig
and
hat
of
his
friend
the
school
-
master
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
go
,
than
I
begin
to
consider
my
situation
with
great
uneasiness
,
and
revolve
all
the
scheme
my
imagination
could
suggest
,
in
order
to
chuse
and
pursue
some
one
that
would
procure
me
bread
;
for
it
be
impossible
to
express
the
pang
I
feel
,
when
I
reflect
on
the
miserable
dependance
in
which
I
live
,
at
the
expence
of
a
poor
barber
's
boy
.
 
<EOS>
My
pride
take
the
alarm
,
and
have
no
hope
of
succeed
at
the
navy
-
office
,
I
come
to
a
resolution
of
enlist
in
the
foot
guard
next
day
,
coute
qui
coute
.
 
<EOS>
this
extravagant
design
,
by
flatter
my
disposition
,
give
great
satisfaction
,
and
I
be
charge
the
enemy
at
the
head
of
my
own
regiment
,
when
Strap
's
return
interrupt
my
reverie
.
 
<EOS>
the
school
-
master
have
make
him
a
present
of
the
tye
-
wig
which
he
wear
when
I
be
introduce
to
him
,
together
with
an
old
hat
,
whose
brim
would
have
overshadow
a
Colossus
.
 
<EOS>
Though
Strap
have
venture
to
wear
them
in
the
dusk
,
he
do
not
chuse
to
entertain
the
mob
by
day
;
therefore
go
to
work
immediately
and
reduce
them
both
to
a
moderate
size
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
employ
in
this
manner
,
he
address
me
thus
:
 
"
to
be
sure
,
Mr
Random
,
you
be
bear
a

and
have
a
great
deal
of

indeed
look

for
as
to
person
you
may
hold
up
your
head
with
the
good
of
them
.
     
<EOS>
on
the
other

,
I
be
a

son
 
<EOS>
my

,
which
you
very
well
know
 
but
every
body
have
failing
 
<EOS>
humanum

<EOS>
now
for
myself
I
be
a
poor
journeyman
barber
,
tolerably
well
make
,
and
understand
some
Latin
,
and
have
a
smattering
of
greek
 
<EOS>
but
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
also
say
that
I
know
a
little
of
the
world
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
to
the
purpose
 
though
you
be
gentle
<EOS>
and
I
simple
,
it
do
not
follow
but
that
I
who
be
simple
may
do
a
good
office
to
you
who
be
gentle
.
 
<EOS>
now
this
be
the
case
 
my
kinsman
the
school

master
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
do
not
know
,
how
nearly
he
be
relate
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
will
satisfy
you
in
that
presently

"
 
<EOS>
My
impatience
to
know
the
good
office
he
have
do
me
,
get
the
well
of
my
temper
,
and
I
interrupt
him
at
this
place

with
,
"

<EOS>
when
I
pronounce
these
word
with
some
vehemence
,
Strap
look
at
me
for
some
time
with
a
grave
countenance
,
and
then
go
on
:
"
surely
,
our
pedigree
be
not

d####n'd

because
it
be
not
so
noble
as

<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
to
see
such
an
alteration
in
your

late
 
you

"
 
<EOS>
I
be
too
much
interested
in
this
piece
of
news
to
entertain
it
with
indifference
;
but
jump
up
,
I
insist
on
Strap

accompany
me
immediately
to
the
house
of
his
friend
,
that
I
may
not
lose
this
opportunity
through
the

delay

neglect

<EOS>
We
be
inform
that
the
school

master
be
in
company
at
a
public
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
whither
we
repair
,
and
find
him
drink
with
the
very
individual
apothecary
in
question
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
call
to
the
door
at
our
desire
,
and
observe
my
impatience
,
he
break
out
in
his
usual
term
of
admiration
:
"
<EOS>
o
Ch####st

<EOS>
I
suppose
when
you
hear
of
this
offer
,
you
do
not
take
leisure
enough
to
come
down
stair
,
but
leapt
out
of
the
window
;
do
you
overturn
no
porter
nor
oyster
-
woman
in
your
way
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
mercy
of
God
<EOS>
you
do
not
knock
your

out
against
some
post

o

I
believe
have
I
be
in

recess
of

even

<EOS>
the

present
you
to
him
forthwith

<EOS>
when
I
enter
the
room
,
I
perceive
four
or
five
people
smoake
,
one
of
whom
the
school
-
master
accost
thus
:
 
"
<EOS>
Mr
Lavement
,
here

the
young
man
of

I
speak

"
 
<EOS>
the
apothecary
,
who
be
a
little
old
withered
man
,
with
a
forehead
about
an
inch
high
,
a
nose
turn
up
at
the
end
,
large
cheek
bone
that
help
to
form
a
pit
for
his
little
grey
eye
,
a
great
bag
of
loose
skin
hang
down
on
each
side
in
wrinkles
,
like
the
alforja
of
a
baboon
;
and
a
mouth
so
accustomed
to
that
contraction
which
produce
grin
,
that
he
could
not
pronounce
a
syllable
without
discover
the
remain
of
his
tooth
,
which
consist
of
four
yellow
fang
,
not
improperly

call

<EOS>
this
person
(
I
say
)
after
have

sometime

"
 
<EOS>
upon
this
I
make
my
bow
,
and
as
I
go
out
of
the
room
,
could
hear
him
say
,

Ma

well
enough
to

write

I

either
yield

the
bargain
be
make

but
before
I
enter
upon
business
,
the
school

master
recommend
me
to
his

give
me
credit
for
a

they
be

that
very
day

he
afterwards
accommodate
me
with
a
new

on
the

so
that
in
a
few
day

I
hope
to
make
a
very
fashionable
appearance

<EOS>
in
the

time

Strap
convey

the

his

and

some

of
the

<EOS>
the

and

rival
 
<EOS>
I
be
guilty
of
a
mistake
that
give
me
present
satisfaction

but
be
attend
with
troublesome
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
,
while
I
be
at
work
in
the
shop
,
a
bounce
damsel
well
dress
come
in
,
on
pretence
of
find
a
vial
for
some
use
or
other
;
and
take
an
opportunity
when
she
think
I
do
not
mind
her
,
of
observe
me
narrowly
,
go
away
with
a
silent
look
of
disdain
 
<EOS>
I
easily
guess
her
sentiment
,
and
my
pride
take
the
resolution
of
entertain
the
same
indifference
and
neglect
towards
her
 
<EOS>
at
dinner
,
the
maid
with
whom
I
dine
in
the
kitchen
,
give
me
to
understand
that
this
be
my
master
's
only
daughter
,
who
would
have
a
very
handsome
fortune
,
on
account
of
which
,
and
her
beauty
,
a
great
many
young
gentleman
make
their
address
to
her
 
that
she
have
be
twice
on
the
brink
of
marriage
,
but
disappoint
by
the
stinginess
of
her
father
,
who
refuse
to
part
with
a
shilling
as
long
as
he
should
live
 
for
which
reason
the
young
lady
do
not
behave
to
her
father
with
all
the
filial
veneration
that
may
be
expect
:
    
<EOS>
in
particular
,
she
harbour'd
<EOS>
the
most
perfect
hatred
for
his
countryman
,
in
which
disposition
her
mother
join'd
,
who
be
an
english
woman
;
and
by
the
hint
<EOS>
they
dropp'd
,
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
learn'd
<EOS>
the
grey
mare
be
the
well
horse
 
that
she
be
a
matron
of
a
high
spirit
,
which
be
often
manifest
at
the
expence
of
her
dependant
:
<EOS>
that
she
lov'd
diversion
;
and
look'd
upon
miss
as
her
rival
in
all
party
;
which
be
indeed
the
true
cause
of
her
disappointment
;
for
have
the
mother
be
hearty
in
her
interest
,
the
father
would
not
have
ventur'd
to
refuse
her
demand
.
 
<EOS>
over
and
above
this
intelligence
,
I
of
myself
,
soon
make
more
discovery
;
Mr
Lavement
's
significant
grin
at
his
wife
,
while
she
look'd
another
way
,
convinc'd
me
that
he
be
not
at
all
content
with
his
lot
:
<EOS>
and
his
behaviour
in
presence
of
the
captain
,
make
me
believe
his
chief
torment
be
jealousy
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
I
be
consider'd
<EOS>
in
no
other
light
than
that
of
a
menial
servant
,
and
have
be
already
six
day
in
the
house
without
be
honour'd
<EOS>
with
one
word
from
either
mother
or
daughter
,
the
latter
(
as
I
understand
from
the
maid
)
have
at
table
one
day
,
express
some
surprize
that
her
papa
should
entertain
such
an
aukward
,
mean
-
look
journeyman
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
nettle
at
this
piece
of
information
,
and
next
sunday
,
(
it
be
my
turn
to
take
my
diversion
)
<EOS>
dress
myself
in
my
new
cloath
to
the
great
advantage
,
and
,
vanity
apart
,
make
no
contemptible
figure

<EOS>
after
have
spend
most
part
of
the
day
in
company
with
Strap
and
some
of
his
acquaintance
,
I
come
home
in
the
afternoon
,
and
be
let
in
by
miss
,
who
not
know
me
,
dropt
a
low
courtesy
as
I
advance
,
<EOS>
which
I
return
with
a
profound
bow
,
and
shut
the
door
 
by
that
time
I
have
turn'd
about
<EOS>
,
she
have
perceiv'd
<EOS>
her
mistake
,
and
chang'd
colour
,
but
do
not
withdraw
.
    
<EOS>
the
passage
be
narrow
,
I
could
not
get
away
without
jostle
her
;
so
,
I
be
forc'd
to
remain
where
I
be
,
with
my
eye
fix'd
on
the
ground
,
and
my
face
glow
with
blush
 
<EOS>
at
length
her
vanity
come
to
her
assistance
,
she
go
away
titter
,
and
I
could
hear
her
pronounce
<EOS>
the
word
"
creature
:
"
<EOS>
from
this
day
forward
,
she
come
into
the
shop
fifty
time
every
day
,
upon
various
pretence
,
and
put
in
practice
so
many
ridiculous
air
,
that
I
could
easily
perceive
her
opinion
of
me
be
chang'd
,
and
that
she
do
not
think
me
altogether
an
unworthy
conquest
 
<EOS>
but
my
heart
be
so
steel'd
<EOS>
against
her
charm
by
pride
and
resentment
,
which
be
two
chief
ingredient
in
my
disposition
,
that
I
remain'd
insensible
to
all
her
art
;
and
notwithstanding
some
advance
she
make
,
could
not
be
prevail'd
upon
to
yield
her
the
least
attention
 
<EOS>
this
neglect
soon
banish'd
<EOS>
all
the
favourable
impression
she
feel
for
me
,
and
the
rage
of
a
slight
woman
take
place
in
her
heart
;
which
she
manifest
not
only
in
all
the
suggestion
her
malice
could
invent
to
my
prejudice
with
her
father
,
but
also
in
procure
for
me
such
servile
employment
,
as
she
hope
,
would
sufficiently
humble
my
spirit
.
    
<EOS>
one
day
in
particular
,
she
order'd
<EOS>
me
to
brush
my
master
's
coat
,
but
<EOS>
I
refuse
,
a
smart
dialogue
ensue
,
which
end
in
her
burst
into
tear
of
rage
;
when
her
mother
interpose
,
and
examine
into
the
merit
of
the
cause
,
determin'd
it
in
my
favour
;
and
this
good
office
I
ow'd
not
to
any
esteem
or
consideration
she
have
for
me
,
but
solely
to
the
desire
of
mortify
her
daughter
,
who
on
this
occasion
observ'd
,
that
let
people
be
never
so
much
in
the
right
,
there
be
some
folk
who
would
never
do
them
justice
;
but
to
be
sure
,
they
have
their
reason
for
it
,
which
some
people
be
not
ignorant
of
,
although
they
despise
their
little
art
.
 
<EOS>
this
insinuation
of
some
people
and
some
folk
,
put
me
upon
observe
the
behaviour
of
my
mistress
more
narrowly
for
the
future
;
and
it
be
not
long
before
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
she
look'd
<EOS>
upon
her
daughter
as
a
rival
in
the
affection
of
captain
Odonnell
,
who
lodge
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
my
industry
and
knowledge
gain'd
<EOS>
me
the
good
will
of
my
master
,
who
would
often
say
in
French
,
"
 
Mardy
!
<EOS>
c'est
un
bon
Garcon
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
a
great
deal
of
business
;
but
as
he
be
mostly
employ'd
among
his
fellow
refugee
,
his
profit
be
small
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
his
expence
for
medicine
be
not
great
,
he
be
the
most
expert
man
at
a
succedaneum
,
of
any
apothecary
in
London
,
so
that
I
have
be
sometimes
amaz'd
to
see
him
without
the
least
hesitation
,
make
up
a
physician
's
prescription
,
though
he
have
not
in
his
shop
one
medicine
mention'd
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Oyster
-
shell
he
could
convert
into
crab
's
eye
;
common
oil
into
oil
of
sweet
almond
;
syrup
of
sugar
into
balsamic
syrup
;
<EOS>
Thames
water
into
aqua
cinnamomi
;
turpentine
into
capivi
;
and
a
hundred
more
costly
preparation
be
produc'd
in
an
instant
,
from
the
cheap
and
cours
drug
of
the
materia
medica
:
<EOS>
and
when
any
common
thing
be
order'd
for
a
patient
,
he
always
take
care
to
disguise
it
in
colour
or
taste
,
or
both
,
in
such
a
manner
,
as
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
know
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
purpose
,
cochineal
and
oil
of
clove
be
of
great
service
among
many
nostrum
which
he
possess'd
;
there
be
one
for
the
venereal
disease
,
<EOS>
that
bring
him
a
good
deal
of
money
;
and
this
he
<EOS>
conceal'd
<EOS>
so
artfully
from
me
,
that
I
could
never
learn
its
composition
:
    
<EOS>
but
during
the
eight
month
I
stay'd
<EOS>
in
his
service
,
he
be
so
unfortunate
in
the
use
of
it
,
that
three
part
in
four
of
those
who
take
it
,
be
fain
to
confirm
the
cure
with
a
salivation
under
the
direction
of
another
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
this
bad
success
,
in
all
appearance
,
<EOS>
attach'd
him
the
more
to
his
specifick
;
and
before
I
leave
him
,
I
may
venture
to
say
,
he
would
have
sooner
renounc'd
<EOS>
the
Trinity
(
notwithstanding
his
be
a
good
Huegonot
)
than
his
confidence
in
the
never
-
fail
power
of
this
remedy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Lavement
have
attempt
more
than
once
,
to
introduce
a
vegetable
diet
into
his
family
,
by
launch
out
into
the
praise
of
it
,
and
decry
the
use
of
flesh
,
both
as
a
Physician
and
Philosopher
;
but
all
his
rhetoric
could
not
make
one
proselyte
to
his
opinion
,
and
even
the
wife
of
his
bosom
declare
against
the
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
whether
it
be
owe
to
the
little
regard
she
pay
to
her
husband
's
admonition
in
this
particular
,
or
to
the
natural
warmth
of
her
constitution
,
I
know
not
;
but
this
lady
's
passion
become
every
day
more
and
more
violent
,
till
at
last
she
look'd
upon
decency
as
an
unnecessary
restraint
;
and
one
afternoon
,
when
her
husband
be
abroad
,
and
her
daughter
visit
,
order'd
<EOS>
me
to
call
a
hackney
coach
,
in
which
she
and
the
captain
drive
off
towards
Covent
-
Garden
.
 
<EOS>
Miss

home
in
the
evening
,
and
sup
at
her
usual
hour
,
go
to

<EOS>
about
eleven
a
clock
my
master
enter'd
,
and
ask'd
if
his
wife
be
go
to
sleep
:
upon
which
I
tell
him
,
my
mistress
go
out
in
the
afternoon
,
and
be
not
yet
return'd
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
like
a
clap
of
thunder
to
the
poor
Apothecary
,
who
start
back
,
cry
"
Mort

<EOS>
My

"
     
<EOS>
at
that
instant
a
patient
's
servant
arriv'd
with
a
prescription
for
a
draught
,
which
my
master
take
,
go
into
the
shop
to
make
it
up
himself
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
rubb'd
the
ingredient
in
a
glass
mortar
,
he
enquir'd
of
me
,
whether
or
no
his
wife
go
out
alone
;
and
no
sooner
hear
that
she
be
in
company
with
the
captain
,
than
with
one
blow
he
split
the
mortar
into
a
thousand
piece
,
and
grin
like
the
head
of
a
bass
viol
,
exclaim'd
,
"
ah
traitresse

"
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
impossible
for
me
to
have
preserv'd
my
gravity
<EOS>
a
minute
longer
,
when
I
be
happily
reliev'd
<EOS>
by
a
rap
at
the
door
,
which
I
open'd
,
<EOS>
and
perceiv'd
<EOS>
my
mistress
come
out
of
a
coach
;
she
flounc'd
immediately
into
the
shop
,
and
address
her
husband
thus
<EOS>
:
"
I

<EOS>
here
the
captain
,
who
have
be
all
the
while
at
the
door
discharge
the
coach
,
entering
,
say
with
a
terrible
voice
,
"

<EOS>
Mr

change
his

<EOS>
then
turn
about
towards
me
,
pronounc'd
with
a
low
voice
,
"

Harkee
,
Mr
Lavement
,
(
say
the
captain
)
<EOS>
I
be
a
man
of
honour
,
and
I
believe
you
be
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
be
offend
at
the
civility
<EOS>
I
shew
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
declaration
have
such
an
effect
on
the
apothecary
,
that
he
resum'd
all
the
politesse
of
a
Frenchman
;
and
with
the
utmost
prostration
of
compliment
,
<EOS>
assur'd
<EOS>
the
captain
that
he
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
honour
he
have
do
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
compos'd
,
every
body
go
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
perceiv'd
thro
'
a
glass
door
that
open'd
from
the
shop
into
a
parlour
,
the
captain
talk
earnestly
to
miss
,
who
hear
him
with
a
look
that
express
anger
mingle
with
scorn
;
which
however
he
at
last
find
mean
to
mollify
,
and
seal'd
<EOS>
his
reconciliation
with
a
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
this
soon
<EOS>
convinc'd
me
of
the
occasion
of
the
quarrel
;
but
notwithstanding
all
my
vigilance
,
I
could
never
discover
any
other
commerce
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
while
,
I
have
reason
to
believe
I
have
<EOS>
inspir'd
<EOS>
one
of
the
maid
with
tender
sentiment
for
me
;
and
one
night
when
I
think
every
other
person
in
the
house
asleep
,
I
take
the
opportunity
of
the
other
maid
's
absence
(
for
she
have
get
leave
to
go
and
visit
her
sick
father
who
liv'd
at
Richmond
)
to
avail
myself
of
my
conquest
:
<EOS>
accordingly
I
get
up
,
and
(
naked
as
I
be
)
<EOS>
explor'd
<EOS>
my
way
in
the
dark
,
to
the
garret
where
she
lie
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ravish'd
to
find
the
door
open
,
and
move
softly
to
her
bed
-
side
,
transport
with
the
hope
of
compleate
my
wish
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
horror
of
jealousy
and
disappointment
do
I
feel
,
when
I
find
her
asleep
,
fast
lock
in
the
arm
of
a
man
,
whom
I
easily
guess
to
be
no
other
than
the
captain
's
servant
!
<EOS>
I
be
upon
the
point
of
do
some
rash
thing
,
when
the
noise
of
a
rat
scratching
behind
the
wainscoat
,
put
me
to
flight
,
and
I
be
fain
to
get
back
to
my
own
bed
in
safety
.
     
<EOS>
whether
this
alarm
have
disorder'd
<EOS>
my
mind
,
or
that
I
be
lead
astray
by
the
power
of
destiny
,
I
know
not
;
but
instead
of
turn
to
the
left
when
I
descend
to
the
second
story
,
<EOS>
I
persu'd
<EOS>
the
contrary
course
,
and
mistake
the
young
lady
's
bed
-
chamber
for
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
perceive
my
mistake
before
I
have
run
against
the
bed
post
;
and
then
it
be
not
in
my
power
to
retreat
undiscover'd
:
for
the
nymph
be
awake
,
feel
my
approach
,
and
with
a
soft
voice
,
bid
me
make
less
noise
lest
the
Scotch
-
booby
in
the
next
room
should
over
-
hear
us
.
<EOS>
this
hint
be
sufficient
to
inform
me
of
the
nature
of
the
assignation
;
and
as
my
passion
,
at
any
time
high
,
be
then
in
a
state
of
exaltation
,
I
be
resolve
to
profit
by
my
good
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
without
any
more
ceremony
therefore
,
I
make
bold
to
slip
into
bed
to
this
charmer
,
who
give
me
as
favourable
a
reception
as
I
could
desire
.
 
<EOS>
Our
conversation
be
very
spare
on
my
part
,
but
she
upbraid
the
person
whom
I
represent
,
with
his
jealousy
of
me
,
whom
she
handle
so
roughly
,
that
my
resentment
have
well
nigh
occasion'd
<EOS>
a
discovery
more
than
once
<EOS>
;
but
I
be
console
for
her
hatred
of
me
,
by
understand
from
her
own
mouth
,
that
it
be
now
high
time
to
salve
her
reputation
by
matrimony
;
for
she
have
reason
to
fear
she
could
not
much
longer
conceal
the
effect
of
their
mutual
intercourse
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
meditate
an
answer
to
this
proposal
,
I
hear
a
noise
in
my
room
,
like
something
heavy
fall
down
upon
the
floor
:
upon
which
,
I
start
up
,
and
creep
to
the
door
of
my
chamber
,
observ'd
by
moon
-
light
,
the
shadow
of
a
man
grope
his
way
out
;
whereupon
,
I
retir'd
<EOS>
to
one
side
to
let
him
pass
,
and
see
him
go
down
stair
as
expeditiously
as
he
could
.
     
<EOS>
It
be
an
easy
matter
to
divine
that
this
be
the
captain
,
who
have
over
-
sleep
himself
,
have
get
up
at
last
to
keep
his
assignation
;
and
find
my
door
open
,
have
enter'd
into
my
apartment
instead
of
that
of
his
mistress
,
where
I
supply
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
find
his
mistake
,
by
fall
over
my
chair
,
be
afraid
the
noise
may
alarm
the
family
,
and
for
that
reason
make
off
,
delay
the
gratification
of
his
desire
till
another
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
I
be
satisfied
;
and
instead
of
return
to
the
place
from
whence
<EOS>
I
come
,
retreat
to
my
own
castle
,
which
I
fortify
by
bolt
the
door
;
and
in
the
congratulation
of
my
own
happiness
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
truth
of
this
adventure
could
not
be
long
conceal'd
from
my
young
mistress
,
who
next
day
come
to
an
eclaircisement
with
the
captain
,
upon
his
lament
his
last
night
's
disappointment
,
and
beg
pardon
for
the
noise
he
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
Their
mutual
chagrin
,
when
they
come
to
the
knowledge
of
what
have
happen'd
,
may
be
easily
conjectur'd
,
though
each
have
a
peculiar
grief
unfelt
by
the
other
;
for
she
be
conscious
of
have
not
only
betray'd
to
me
the
secret
of
her
commerce
with
him
;
but
also
,
of
have
incense
me
by
the
freedom
she
have
take
with
my
name
,
beyond
a
hope
of
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
his
jealousy
suggest
,
that
her
sorrow
be
all
artifice
;
and
that
I
have
supply
his
place
with
her
own
privity
and
consent
.
 
<EOS>
that
such
be
the
situation
of
their
thought
,
will
appear
in
the
sequel
 
for
that
very
day
<EOS>
she
come
into
the
shop
where
I
be
alone
,
and
fix
her
eye
,
swim
in
tear
,
upon
me
,
<EOS>
sigh'd
<EOS>
most
piteously
:
    
<EOS>
but
I
be
proof
against
her
distress
,
by
recollect
the
epithet
with
which
she
have
honour'd
<EOS>
me
the
night
before
;
and
believe
that
the
good
reception
<EOS>
I
enjoy'd
be
destin'd
for
another
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
take
no
notice
of
her
affliction
;
and
she
have
the
mortification
to
find
her
disdain
return'd
four
-
fold
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
from
thenceforward
she
think
proper
to
use
me
with
more
complaisance
than
usual
,
know
that
it
be
in
my
power
at
any
time
to
publish
her
shame
.
 
<EOS>
by
these
mean
my
life
become
much
more
agreeable
(
though
I
never
could
prevail
upon
myself
to
repeat
my
nocturnal
visit
)
and
as
I
every
day
improv'd
<EOS>
in
my
knowledge
of
the
town
,
I
shake
off
my
aukward
air
by
degree
,
and
acquir'd
the
character
of
a
polite
journeyman
apothecary
.

CHAPTER
XX
I
be
assault
and
dangerously
wound
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
Odonnell
,
and
be
confirm
in
my
opinion
 
<EOS>
I
concert
a
scheme
of
revenge
,
and
put
it
in
execution
 
<EOS>
Odonnell
rob
his
own
servant
,
and
disappear
 
<EOS>
I
make
my
address
to
a
lady
,
and
be
miraculously
deliver'd
<EOS>
from
her
snare
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
about
twelve
a
clock
,
as
I
return'd
from
visit
a
patient
at
Chelsea
<EOS>
,
I
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
blow
on
my
head
from
an
unseen
hand
,
that
stretch'd
me
senseless
on
the
ground
;
and
be
leave
for
dead
,
with
three
stab
of
a
sword
in
my
body
.
     
<EOS>
the
groan
<EOS>
I
utter'd
<EOS>
when
I
recover'd
the
use
of
my
reason
,
<EOS>
alarm'd
the
people
of
a
solitary
ale
-
house
,
that
stand
near
the
spot
where
I
lay
,
and
they
be
humane
enough
to
take
me
in
,
and
send
for
a
surgeon
who
dress
my
wound
,
and
assur'd
me
they
be
not
mortal
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
penetrate
through
the
skin
and
muscle
of
one
side
of
my
belly
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
(
doubtless
)
<EOS>
the
assassin
imagin'd
he
have
run
me
through
the
entrail
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
slant
along
one
of
my
rib
,
and
the
last
,
which
be
intend
for
the
Coup
de
Grace
,
be
direct
to
my
heart
,
the
sword
snapt
upon
my
breast
bone
,
and
the
point
remain'd
stick
in
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
reflect
upon
this
event
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
,
that
I
have
be
assault
by
a
common
footpad
;
because
it
be
not
usual
for
such
people
to
murder
those
they
rob
,
especially
when
they
meet
with
no
resistance
;
and
I
find
my
money
and
everything
else
about
me
(
but
my
carcase
)
<EOS>
safe
.
<EOS>
I
conclude
therefore
,
that
I
must
either
have
be
mistake
for
another
,
or
oblig'd
to
the
private
resentment
of
some
secret
enemy
for
what
have
happen
;
and
as
I
could
remember
no
-
body
who
have
the
least
cause
of
complaint
against
me
,
except
captain
Odonnell
and
my
master
's
daughter
,
my
suspicion
settle
upon
them
,
though
I
take
care
to
conceal
it
,
that
I
may
the
sooner
arrive
at
confirmation
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
I
go
home
in
a
chair
about
ten
a
clock
in
the
morning
;
and
as
the
chairman
support
me
into
the
house
,
meet
the
captain
in
the
passage
;
who
no
sooner
see
me
,
than
he
start
back
,
and
give
evident
sign
of
guilty
confusion
,
which
he
would
have
account
for
from
the
surprize
occasion'd
by
see
me
in
such
a
condition
.
     
<EOS>
My
master
have
hear
my
story
,
condole
me
with
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
,
and
when
he
understand
my
wound
be
not
dangerous
,
order'd
<EOS>
me
to
be
carry
up
stair
to
bed
;
though
not
without
some
opposition
from
his
wife
,
who
be
of
opinion
,
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
go
to
an
hospital
,
where
I
should
be
more
carefully
attend
.
 
<EOS>
My
meditation
be
employ'd
in
concert
with
myself
some
method
of
revenge
against
"
Squire
Odonnell
and
his
enamorata
,
whom
I
look
upon
as
the
author
of
my
misfortune
;
when
miss
(
who
be
not
at
home
at
my
arrival
)
enter
my
chamber
;
and
say
,
she
be
sorry
for
the
accident
that
have
befall
me
,
ask
me
if
I
suspect
any
body
to
be
the
assassin
:
upon
which
I
fix
my
eye
stedfastly
upon
her
,
and
answer'd
,
"
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
discover'd
<EOS>
no
symptom
of
confusion
;
but
reply
hastily
,
"
if
that
be
the
case
,
why
do
not
you
take
out
a
warrant
to
have
him
apprehend
?
 
<EOS>
It
will
cost
but
a
trifle
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
no
money
,
I
will
lend
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
frankness
not
only
cur'd
me
of
my
suspicion
with
respect
to
her
;
but
even
stagger'd
<EOS>
my
belief
in
regard
to
the
captain
,
of
whose
guilt
<EOS>
I
resolv'd
to
have
farther
proof
,
before
I
enterpriz'd
any
thing
in
the
way
of
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
her
kindly
for
her
generous
offer
;
which
however
I
have
no
occasion
to
accept
,
be
determin'd
to
do
nothing
rashly
:
<EOS>
for
though
I
could
plainly
perceive
the
person
who
attack
me
,
to
be
a
soldier
whose
face
I
think
be
familiar
to
me
,
I
could
not
swear
with
a
safe
conscience
to
any
particular
man
;
and
grant
I
could
,
my
prosecution
of
him
would
not
much
avail
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
pretend
,
lest
the
captain
hearing
from
her
<EOS>
,
that
I
know
the
person
who
wound
me
,
may
think
proper
to
withdraw
before
I
could
be
in
a
condition
to
requite
him
.
     
<EOS>
in
two
day
I
be
up
,
and
able
to
do
a
little
business
,
so
that
Mr
Lavement
make
shift
to
carry
on
his
practice
,
without
hire
another
journeyman
in
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
attempt
towards
a
certain
discovery
of
my
secret
enemy
,
be
to
get
into
Odonnell
's
apartment
,
while
he
be
abroad
in
an
undress
,
and
examine
his
sword
,
the
point
of
which
be
break
off
,
I
apply
the
fragment
that
be
find
stick
in
my
body
;
and
find
it
<EOS>
answer'd
<EOS>
the
fractur'd
part
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
now
no
room
leave
for
doubt
;
and
all
that
remain'd
,
be
to
fix
upon
a
scheme
of
revenge
,
which
almost
solely
engross
my
thought
during
the
space
of
eight
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
be
tempt
to
fall
upon
him
in
the
same
manner
as
he
have
practise
upon
me
,
and
kill
him
outright
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
my
honour
oppos'd
,
as
a
piece
of
barbarous
cowardice
,
in
which
he
be
not
to
be
imitate
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
I
entertain'd
thought
of
demand
satisfaction
in
an
honourable
way
;
but
be
divert
from
this
undertaking
,
by
consider
the
uncertainty
of
the
event
,
and
the
nature
of
the
injury
he
have
do
me
,
which
do
not
intitle
him
to
such
easy
term
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
determin'd
to
pursue
a
middle
course
;
and
actually
put
my
design
in
execution
after
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
have
secure
the
assistance
of
Strap
and
two
of
his
acquaintance
whom
he
could
depend
upon
;
we
provide
ourselves
in
disguise
,
and
I
cause
the
following
letter
to
be
deliver'd
<EOS>
to
him
by
one
of
our
associate
in
livery
,
one
Sunday
evening
.
    
<EOS>
SIR
,
"
if
I
may
be
allow
to
judge
from
appearance
,
it
will
not
be
disagreeable
to
you
,
to
hear
that
my
husband
be
send
for
to
Bagshot
to
visit
a
patient
,
and
will
not
return
till
to
-
morrow
night
;
so
that
if
you
have
any
thing
to
propose
to
me
(
as
your
behaviour
on
many
occasion
have
seem
to
insinuate
)
<EOS>
you
will
do
well
to
embrace
the
present
opportunity
of
see
"
Yours
,
&
c.
"
    
<EOS>
this
letter
be
sign
with
the
name
of
an
apothecary
's
wife
,
who
live
in
Chelsea
,
of
whom
I
have
hear
Odonnell
be
an
admirer
.
 
<EOS>
every
thing
succeed
to
our
wish
.
 
<EOS>
the
amorous
hero
hasten
towards
the
place
of
assignation
;
and
be
encounter
by
us
in
the
very
place
where
he
have
assault
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
rush
upon
him
all
at
once
,
secure
his
sword
,
stript
off
his
cloath
even
to
the
skin
,
which
we
scourge
with
nettle
till
he
be
blister
from
head
to
foot
,
notwithstanding
all
the
eloquence
of
his
tear
and
supplication
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
satisfied
with
the
stripe
I
have
bestow
,
we
carry
off
his
cloath
,
which
we
hide
in
a
hedge
near
the
place
,
and
leave
him
stark
naked
,
to
find
his
way
home
in
the
good
manner
he
could
,
while
I
take
care
to
be
there
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
afterwards
understand
that
in
his
way
to
the
lodging
of
a
friend
,
who
live
in
the
skirt
of
the
town
,
he
be
pick
up
by
the
watch
,
who
carry
him
to
the
Round
-
house
,
from
whence
he
send
for
cloath
to
his
lodging
;
and
next
morning
arrive
at
the
door
in
a
chair
,
wrapt
up
in
a
blanket
he
have
borrow
;
for
his
body
be
so
sore
and
swell
that
he
could
not
bear
to
be
confine
in
his
wear
apparel
.
     
<EOS>
He
be
treat
with
the
utmost
tenderness
by
my
mistress
and
her
daughter
,
who
vie
one
with
the
other
in
their
care
and
attendance
of
him
;
but
Lavement
himself
could
not
forbear
express
his
joy
,
by
several
malicious
grin
,
while
he
order
me
to
prepare
an
unguent
to
anoint
him
with
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
myself
,
no
body
can
doubt
my
gratification
,
when
I
have
every
day
an
opportunity
of
see
my
revenge
protract
on
the
body
of
my
adversary
,
by
the
sore
and
ulcer
I
have
be
the
cause
of
;
and
indeed
I
not
only
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
have
flead
him
alive
,
but
another
also
which
I
have
not
foresee
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
of
his
be
attack
and
stript
in
such
a
place
,
have
be
insert
in
the
news
,
give
information
to
those
who
find
his
cloath
next
day
,
whither
to
bring
them
;
and
accordingly
he
retrieve
every
thing
he
have
lose
,
except
a
few
letter
,
among
which
be
that
which
I
have
write
to
him
in
the
name
of
the
apothecary
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
this
and
the
other
,
which
(
it
seem
)
be
all
on
the
subject
of
love
,
(
for
this
hibernian
hero
be
one
of
those
people
who
be
call
fortune
-
hunter
)
fall
into
the
hand
of
a
certain
female
author
,
famous
for
the
scandal
she
have
publish
;
who
,
after
have
embellish
them
with
some
ornament
of
her
own
invention
,
give
them
to
the
town
in
print
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
shocked
on
reflect
,
that
I
may
possibly
be
the
occasion
of
a
whole
family
's
unhappiness
,
on
account
of
the
letter
I
have
write
;
but
be
ease
of
that
apprehension
,
when
I
understand
that
the
Chelsea
apothecary
have
commence
a
law
-
suit
against
the
printer
for
defamation
;
and
look
upon
the
whole
as
a
piece
of
forgery
,
commit
by
the
author
,
who
have
disappear
.
     
<EOS>
but
whatever
may
be
his
opinion
of
the
matter
,
our
two
lady
seem
to
entertain
a
different
idea
of
it
;
for
,
as
soon
as
the
pamphlet
appear
,
I
could
perceive
their
care
of
their
patient
considerably
diminish
,
until
at
last
it
end
in
total
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
him
to
be
ignorant
of
this
change
,
any
more
than
of
the
occasion
of
it
;
but
as
he
be
conscious
to
himself
of
have
deserve
worse
than
contempt
at
their
hand
,
he
be
glad
to
come
off
so
cheaply
,
and
content
himself
with
muttering
curse
and
threat
against
the
apothecary
,
who
(
as
he
imagine
)
have
get
an
inkling
of
the
appointment
with
his
wife
,
have
take
revenge
of
him
in
the
manner
describe
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
time
he
have
get
a
new
scarf
skin
,
his
character
be
become
so
notorious
,
that
he
think
it
high
time
for
him
to
decamp
;
which
he
perform
one
night
without
beat
of
drum
,
after
have
rob
his
own
servant
of
every
thing
that
belong
to
him
except
the
cloath
he
have
on
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
he
disappear
,
Mr
Lavement
,
for
his
own
security
,
take
into
custody
a
large
old
trunk
which
he
have
leave
;
and
as
it
be
very
heavy
,
make
no
question
of
the
content
be
sufficient
to
indemnify
him
for
what
Odonnel
owe
in
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
month
be
elapse
without
hear
any
tiding
of
this
adventurer
;
and
my
master
be
impatient
to
know
what
the
trunk
contain
;
he
order
me
to
break
it
open
in
his
presence
,
which
I
perform
with
the
pestle
of
our
great
mortar
,
and
discover
,
to
his
inexpressible
astonishment
and
mortification
,
a
heap
of
stone
.
    
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
my
friend
Strap
inform
me
of
an
offer
he
have
to
go
abroad
with
a
gentleman
in
quality
of
valet
de
chambre
,
and
at
the
same
time
assure
me
,
that
whatever
advantage
he
may
propose
to
himself
from
this
prospect
,
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
part
from
me
;
so
much
be
he
attach
to
my
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
the
obligation
I
owe
this
poor
honest
fellow
,
ingratitude
be
so
natural
to
the
heart
of
man
,
that
I
begin
to
be
tired
of
his
acquaintance
;
and
now
,
that
I
have
contract
other
friendship
which
appear
more
creditable
,
I
be
even
ashamed
to
see
a
journeyman
barber
enquire
after
me
with
the
familiarity
of
a
companion
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
,
on
pretence
of
consult
his
welfare
,
insist
upon
his
accept
the
proposal
,
which
he
at
last
determine
to
embrace
,
with
great
reluctance
,
and
in
a
few
day
take
his
leave
of
me
,
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
which
I
could
not
behold
without
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
look
upon
myself
as
a
gentleman
in
reality
;
learn
to
dance
of
a
Frenchman
whom
I
have
cure
of
a
fashionable
distemper
;
frequented
play
during
the
holiday
;
become
the
oracle
of
an
ale
-
house
,
where
every
dispute
be
refer
to
my
decision
;
and
at
length
contract
an
acquaintance
with
a
young
lady
,
who
find
mean
to
make
a
conquest
of
my
heart
,
and
upon
whom
I
prevail
,
after
much
attendance
and
solicitation
,
to
give
me
a
promise
of
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
as
this
beautiful
creature
pass
for
a
rich
heiress
,
I
bless
my
good
fortune
,
and
be
actually
on
the
point
of
crown
all
my
wish
,
by
matrimony
;
when
one
morning
,
I
go
to
her
lodging
,
and
her
maid
be
abroad
,
take
the
privilege
of
a
bridegroom
to
enter
her
chamber
,
where
to
my
utter
confusion
<EOS>
I
find
her
in
bed
with
a
man
.
     
<EOS>
Heaven

me
patience
and

enough
to
withdraw
immediately

I
thank
my
star
a

for
the
happy
discovery

by
which
I
resolve
to
profit
so
much

by
accident

I
find
the
lady
to
whom
I
make
my
address
,
in
a
miserable
condition
 
<EOS>

her
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
enjoy
myself
at
large
in
this
temper
of
mind
,
Mr
Lavement
let
his
first
floor
to
my
countryman
and
acquaintance
"
Squire
Gawky
,
who
by
this
time
have
get
a
lieutenancy
in
the
army
,
and
such
a
martial
ferocity
in
his
appearance
,
that
I
be
afraid
he
would
remember
what
have
happen
between
us
in
Scotland
,
and
atone
for
his
breach
of
appointment
then
,
by
his
punctuality
now
;
but
whether
he
have
actually
forget
me
,
or
be
willing
to
make
me
believe
so
,
he
betray
not
the
least
symptom
of
recognition
at
sight
of
me
,
and
<EOS>
I
remain
quite
cure
of
my
apprehension
;
though
I
have
occasion
not
long
after
to
be
convince
,
that
howsoever
his
external
may
be
alter
,
he
be
at
bottom
the
same
individual
Gawky
whom
I
have
already
describe
.
 
<EOS>
for
come
home
late
one
night
from
the
house
of
a
patient
,
I
hear
a
noise
in
the
street
,
and
as
I
approach
,
perceive
two
gentleman
in
custody
of
three
watchman
.
<EOS>
the
prisoner
,
who
seem
to
be
miserably
disfigure
with
dirt
,
complain
bitterly
of
the
loss
of
their
hat
and
wig
;
and
one
of
them
,
whom
by
his
tongue
I
know
to
be
a
Scotchman
,
lament
most
piteously
,
offer
a
guinea
for
his
liberty
,
which
the
watchman
refuse
,
alledge
that
one
of
his
companion
be
wound
grievously
,
and
that
he
must
stand
to
the
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
My
prejudice
in
favour
of
my
native
country
be
so
strong
,
that
I
could
not
bear
to
see
any
body
belong
to
it
in
distress
,
and
therefore
,
with
one
blow
of
my
faithful
cudgel
,
knock
down
the
watchman
who
have
hold
of
the
person
for
whom
I
be
chiefly
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
find
himself
disengage
,
than
he
betake
himself
to
his
heel
,
and
leave
me
to
maintain
the
dispute
as
I
should
think
proper
;
and
indeed
I
come
off
but
scurvily
,
for
before
I
could
avail
myself
of
my
speed
<EOS>
,
I
receive
a
blow
on
the
eye
,
from
one
of
the
other
two
,
that
have
well
nigh
deprive
me
of
the
use
of
that
organ
;
however
,
I
make
shift
to
get
home
,
where
I
be
inform
of
captain
Gawky
's
be
robb'd
and
abuse
by
a
company
of
foot
-
pad
;
and
be
order
by
my
master
to
prepare
an
emollient
glyster
and
paregorick
draught
,
in
order
to
allay
and
compose
the
ferment
of
his
spirit
,
occasion
by
the
barbarous
treatment
he
have
undergo
,
while
he
take
twelve
ounce
of
blood
from
him
immediately
.
     
<EOS>
when
I
enquire
into
the
particular
of
this
adventure
,
and
understand
by
the
servant
,
that
he
come
in
just
before
me
,
without
hat
and
wig
,
I
make
no
scruple
of
believe
him
to
be
the
person
I
have
release
,
and
be
confirm
in
that
belief
upon
hear
his
voice
,
to
which
(
before
that
event
)
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
long
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
My
eye
be
considerably
swell
and
inflame
,
I
could
not
reflect
upon
my
enterprise
without
curse
my
own
folly
,
and
even
resolve
to
declare
the
truth
of
the
whole
story
,
in
order
to
be
revenge
on
the
cowardly
wretch
,
for
whom
I
have
suffer
<EOS>
:
accordingly
,
next
day
,
after
he
have
tell
,
in
presence
of
my
master
,
his
wife
and
daughter
,
who
come
to
visit
him
,
a
thousand
lie
concern
the
prowess
he
have
shew
in
make
his
escape
,
I
venture
to
explain
the
mystery
,
and
call
in
the
evidence
of
my
contused
eye
,
upbraid
him
with
cowardice
and
ingratitude
.
 
<EOS>
Gawky
be
so
astonished
at
this
discourse
,
that
he
could
not
answer
one
word
;
and
the
rest
of
the
company
stare
at
one
another
;
till
at
length
my
mistress
repremande
me
for
my
insolent
behaviour
,
and
threaten
to
turn
me
away
for
my
presumption
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
,
Gawky
(
have
recollect
himself
)
observe
,
as
the
young
man
may
have
mistake
another
person
for
him
,
he
could
forgive
his
insinuation
,
more
especially
as
he
seem
to
have
suffer
for
his
civility
;
but
advise
me
to
be
more
certain
in
my
conjecture
for
the
future
,
before
I
venture
to
publish
them
to
the
prejudice
of
any
man
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
applaud
the
captain
's
generosity
in
pardon
one
who
have
so
villainously
asperse
him
,
and
I
begin
to
imagine
her
praise
be
not
at
all
disintereste
.
     
<EOS>
but
the
apothecary
,
who
perhaps
have
more
penetration
,
or
less
partiality
than
his
wife
and
daughter
,
differ
from
them
in
his
sentiment
of
the
matter
,
and
express
himself
to
me
in
the
shop
in
this
manner
:
"
ah
mon
pauvre
Roderique
!
<EOS>
you
ave
more
of
de
veracite
dan
of
de
prudence
 
bot
mine
vife
and
dater
be
diablement
sage
,
and
Mons
le
capitaine
un
fanfaron
,
pardieu
!
"
 
<EOS>
this
elogium
on
his
wife
and
daughter
,
though
mean
ironically
by
him
,
be
nevertheless
literally
just
;
for
by
espouse
the
cause
of
Gawky
,
the
one
oblige
a
valuable
lodger
,
and
the
other
acquire
a
husband
at
a
juncture
,
when
one
be
absolutely
necessary
;
for
the
young
lady
find
the
effect
of
her
correspondence
with
Odonnel
become
plainer
and
plainer
every
day
,
insinuate
herself
so
artfully
into
the
affection
of
this
new
lodger
,
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
,
on
pretence
of
go
to
a
play
,
they
drive
away
together
to
the
Fleet
,
where
they
be
couple
;
from
thence
remove
to
a
bagnio
,
where
the
marriage
be
consummate
;
and
in
the
morning
come
home
,
where
they
ask
her
father
's
and
mother
's
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
the
prudent
parent
,
notwithstanding
the
precipitation
with
which
it
be
carry
on
,
do
not
think
fit
to
refuse
their
approbation
;
for
the
apothecary
be
not
ill
pleased
to
find
his
daughter
marry
to
a
young
man
of
a
good
prospect
,
who
have
not
mention
to
him
one
syllable
on
the
article
of
her
dowry
;
and
his
wife
be
rejoice
at
be
rid
of
a
rival
in
her
gallant
,
and
a
spy
upon
her
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
I
without
self
-
enjoyment
,
at
this
event
,
when
I
reflect
upon
the
revenge
I
have
unwittingly
take
upon
my
enemy
,
in
make
him
a
cuckold
by
anticipation
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
little
dream'd
<EOS>
what
a
storm
of
mischief
be
brew
against
me
,
whilst
I
thus
indulge
myself
.
     
<EOS>
whatever
face
Gawkey
put
on
the
matter
,
my
discovery
of
the
adventure
before
relate
,
and
the
reproach
I
vent
against
him
,
have
sting
him
to
the
soul
,
and
cherish
the
seed
of
emnity
so
strongly
in
his
breast
,
that
he
(
it
seem
)
impart
his
indignation
to
his
wife
,
who
be
as
desirous
as
he
to
compass
the
ruin
of
one
that
not
only
slight
her
caress
,
but
be
able
on
any
occasion
to
discover
particular
not
at
all
advantageous
to
her
character
,
readily
join
in
a
conspiracy
against
me
,
which
(
have
it
take
effect
as
they
expect
)
would
infallibly
have
bring
me
to
an
ignominious
death
.
    
<EOS>
My
master
have
several
time
miss
large
quantity
of
medicine
of
which
I
could
give
no
account
,
at
last
lose
all
patience
,
and
in
plain
term
tax
me
with
have
embezzle
them
for
my
own
use
.
<EOS>
as
I
could
only
oppose
my
single
asseveration
to
this
suspicion
,
he
tell
me
one
day
,
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
raise
his
voice
to
conceal
the
fright
he
be
in
,
lest
I
should
make
any
opposition
,
he
go
on
,
"
Oui

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
fire
with
so
much
resentment
and
disdain
at
this
accusation
,
that
I
burst
into
tear
,
which
he
take
for
a
sign
of
guilt
;
and
pull
out
my
key
,
tell
him
he
may
satisfy
himself
immediately
,
though
he
would
not
find
it
so
easy
<EOS>
so
satisfy
me
for
the
injury
my
reputation
have
suffer
from
his
unjust
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
key
and
mount
up
to
my
chamber
,
attend
by
the
whole
family
;
say
,
"
He
bien

nous
verron

"
     
<EOS>
but
what
be
my
horror
and
amazement
,
when
open
my
chest
,
I
see
them
pull
out
an
handful
of
the
very
thing
that
be
miss
,
and
hear
him
pronounce
,
"
ah

"
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
power
to
utter
one
word
in
my
own
vindication
,
but
stand
motionless
and
silent
,
while
every
body
present
make
their
respective
remark
on
what
appear
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
say
,
they
be
sorry
for
my
misfortune
,
and
go
away
repeat
,
"
who
would
have
think
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mistress
take
occasion
from
this
to
rail
against
the
practice
of
employ
stranger
in
general
;
and
Mrs
Gawky
,
after
have
observe
that
she
never
have
a
good
opinion
of
my
fidelity
,
propose
to
have
me
carry
before
the
justice
and
commit
to
Newgate
immediately
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
be
actually
upon
the
stair
in
his
way
for
a
constable
,
when
Mr
Lavement
,
know
the
cost
and
trouble
of
a
prosecution
to
which
he
must
bind
himself
,
and
at
the
same
time
dread
lest
some
particular
of
my
confession
may
affect
his
practice
,
call
out
,
"
restez

"
     
<EOS>
the
captain
and
his
lady
use
all
the
christian
argument
their
zeal
could
suggest
,
to
prevail
on
the
apothecary
to
pursue
me
to
destruction
,
and
represent
the
injustice
he
do
to
the
community
of
which
he
be
a
member
,
in
let
a
villain
escape
,
who
would
not
fail
of
do
more
mischief
in
the
world
,
when
he
should
reflect
on
his
come
off
so
easily
now
;
 
but
their
eloquence
make
no
impression
on
my
master
,
who
turn
to
me
,
say
,
"
go
,
miserable
,
go
from
mine
house
,
quick
,
quick
 
and
make
reparation
for
your

action

"
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
my
indignation
have
rouse
me
from
the
stupefaction
in
which
I
have
hitherto
remain
,
and
I
begin
in
this
manner
:
"
Sir
,
appearance
,
I
own
,
condemn
me
;
but
you
be
impose
upon
as
much
as
I
be
abuse
 
I
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
rancour
of
that
scoundrel
(
point
to
Gawky
)
who
have
find
mean
to
convey
your
good
hither
,
that
the
detection
of
them
may
blast
my
reputation
,
and
accomplish
my
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
His
hatred
of
me
be
owe
to
a
consciousness
of
have
wrong
me
in
my
own
country
;
for
which
he
in
a
cowardly
manner
refuse
me
the
satisfaction
of
a
gentleman
;
 
he
know
moreover
,
that
I
be
no
stranger
to
his
dastardly
behaviour
in
this
town
,
which
I
have
recount
before
;
 
and
he
be
unwilling
that
such
a
testimony
of
his
ingratitude
and
pusilanimity
should
live
upon
the
earth
;
for
this
reason
he
be
guilty
of
the
most
infernal
malice
to
bring
about
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
afraid
,
madam
,
(
turn
to
Mrs
Gawky
)
<EOS>
you
have
too
easily
enter
into
the
sentiment
of
your
husband
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
find
you
my
enemy
;
and
be
well
acquaint
with
the
occasion
of
your
being
so
,
which
I
do
not
at
present
think
proper
to
declare
;
 
but
I
would
not
advise
you
,
for
your
own
sake
,
to
drive
me
to
extremity
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
this
address
enrage
her
so
much
,
that
with
a
face
as
red
as
scarlet
,
and
the
eye
of
a
fury
,
she
strut
up
to
me
,
and
put
her
hand
in
her
side
,
spit
in
my
face
,
say
,
I
be
a
scandalous
villain
,
but
she
defy
my
malice
;
and
that
unless
her
papa
would
prosecute
me
like
a
thief
as
I
be
,
she
would
not
stay
another
night
under
his
roof
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
Gawky
assume
in
a
big
look
,
tell
me
,
he
scorn
what
lie
I
could
invent
against
him
;
but
that
if
I
pretend
to
asperse
his
wife
,
he
would
put
me
to
death
,
by
G

d

<EOS>
to
this
I
answer
,
"
I
wish
to
God
I
could
meet
with
thee
in
a
desart

that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
of
revenge
thy
perfidy
towards
me

rid
the
world
of
such
a
rascal

moment
(
say
I

seize
an
old
bottle

by
)
from

myself
that
justice

<EOS>
"
I
have
no
sooner
arm
myself
in
this
manner
,
than
Gawky
and
his
father
-
in
law
retire
in
such
a
hurry
,
that
the
one
overturn
the
other
,
and
roll
together
down
stair
;
while
my
mistress
swoon
away
with
fear
;
and
her
daughter
ask
if
I
intend
to
murder
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
her
to
understand
that
nothing
be
farth
from
my
intention
;
that
I
would
leave
her
to
the
sting
of
her
own
conscience

be
firmly
resolve
to
slit
her

whenever
fortune
should
offer
a
convenient
opportunity

<EOS>
then
go
down
stair
,
I
meet
Lavement
come
up
tremble
with
the
pestle
in
his
hand
,
and
Gawky
behind
armed
with
his
sword
<EOS>
push
him
forward
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
a
parley
,
and
have
assure
them
of
my
pacific
disposition
;
Gawky
exclaim
,
"
ah
!
villain
!
<EOS>
you
have
kill
my
dear
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
apothecary
cry
,
"
ah
!
coquin
!
<EOS>
vere
be
my
child
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
lady
(
say
I
)
be
above
stair
,
unhurt
by
me
,
and
will
a
few
month
hence
(
I
believe
)
reward
your
concern
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
she
call
to
them
herself
,
and
desire
they
would
let
the
wretch
go
,
and
trouble
themselves
no
farther
about
him
.
     
<EOS>
to
which
her
father
consent
,
observe
nevertheless
,
that
my
conversation
be
fort
mysterieux
.
 
<EOS>
find
it
impossible
to
vindicate
my
innocence
,
I
leave
the
house
immediately
,
and
go
to
the
schoolmaster
,
with
an
intention
of
clear
myself
to
him
,
and
ask
his
advice
with
regard
to
my
future
conduct
;
but
to
my
inexpressible
vexation
,
be
tell
he
be
go
to
the
country
,
where
he
would
stay
two
or
three
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
return
with
a
design
of
consult
some
acquaintance
I
have
acquire
in
my
master
's
neighbourhood
;
but
my
story
have
take
air
,
through
the
officiousness
of
the
servant
,
and
not
one
of
my
friend
would
vouchsafe
me
a
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
thus
I
find
myself
,
by
the
iniquity
of
mankind
,
in
a
much
more
deplorable
condition
than
ever
:
for
though
I
have
be
formerly
as
poor
,
my
reputation
be
without
blemish
,
and
my
health
unimpaired
till
now
;
 
but
at
present
my
good
name
be
lose
,
my
money
go
,
my
friend
be
alienated
,
my
body
infect
by
a
distemper
contract
in
the
course
of
an
amour
;
and
my
faithful
Strap
,
who
alone
could
yield
me
pity
and
assistance
,
absent
I
know
not
where
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
resolution
I
could
take
in
this
melancholy
conjuncture
,
be
to
remove
my
cloath
to
the
house
of
the
person
with
whom
I
have
formerly
lodg'd
;
there
I
remain
two
day
,
in
hope
of
get
another
place
,
by
the
interest
of
Mr
Concordance
,
to
whom
I
make
no
doubt
of
be
able
to
vindicate
my
character
;
 
but
in
this
I
reckon
without
my
host
,
for
Lavement
take
care
to
be
beforehand
with
me
,
and
<EOS>
when
I
attempt
to
explain
the
whole
affair
to
the
schoolmaster
,
I
find
him
so
prepossess
against
me
,
that
he
would
scarce
hear
me
to
an
end
;
but
when
I
have
finish
my
justification
,
shake
his
head
,
and
begin
with
his
usual
exclamation
,
"
o
Ch####st
!
<EOS>
say
,
that
will
not
go
down
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
I
should
have
the
misfortune
of
be
concern
in
the
affair
,
but
however
shall
be
more
cautious
for
the
future
 
<EOS>
I
will
trust
no
man
from
henceforward
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
my
father
who
beget
me
 
nor
the
brother
who
lie
with
me
in
my
mother
's
womb
 
<EOS>
should
the
genius
of
truth
appear
I
would
question
its
veracity
;
and
if
Daniel
would
rise
from
the
dead
I
should
think
him
an
impostor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
that
one
day
,
it
be
possible
,
he
may
be
convince
of
the
injury
I
have
suffer
,
and
repent
of
his
premature
determination
.
 
<EOS>
to
which
he
answer
the
proof
of
my
innocence
would
make
his
bowel
vibrate
with
joy
;
"
but
till
that
shall
happen
(
continue
he
)
<EOS>
I
must
beg
to
have
no
manner
of
connection
with
you
 
<EOS>
my
reputation
be
at
stake
 
<EOS>
o
my
good
God
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
look
upon
as
your
accomplice
and
abettor
 
people
will
say
Jonathan
Wild
be
but
a
type
of
me
 
<EOS>
boy
will
hoot
at
me
as
I
pass
along
;
and
the
cinder
wench
belch
forth
reproach
waft
in
a
gale
impregnate
with
gin
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
notorious
 
the
very
butt
of
slander
,
and
cloaca
of
infamy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
an
humour
to
relish
the
climax
of
expression
upon
which
this
gentleman
value
himself
in
all
his
discourse
;
but
without
any
ceremony
take
my
leave
,
curse
with
every
sentiment
of
horror
,
which
my
situation
could
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
I
consider
,
however
,
in
the
interval
of
my
despondence
,
that
I
must
in
some
shape
suit
my
expence
to
my
calamitous
circumstance
;
and
with
that
view
hire
an
apartment
in
a
garret
near
St
Giles
's
,
at
the
rate
of
nine
-
pence
per
week
.
     
<EOS>
in
this
place
I
resolve
to
perform
my
own
cure
,
have
first
pawn
three
shirt
to
purchase
medicine
and
support
for
the
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
one
day
when
I
sit
in
this
solitary
retreat
,
muse
upon
the
unhappiness
of
my
fate
,
I
be
alarm
by
a
groan
that
issue
from
a
chamber
contiguous
to
mine
,
into
which
I
immediately
run
,
and
find
a
woman
stretch
on
a
miserable
truckle
bed
,
without
any
visible
sign
of
life
.
<EOS>
have
apply
a
smell
bottle
to
her
nose
,
the
blood
begin
to
revisit
her
cheek
,
and
she
open
her
eye
;
but
,
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
emotion
of
my
soul
,
when
I
discover
her
to
be
the
same
individual
lady
,
who
have
triumph
over
my
heart
,
and
to
whose
fate
I
have
almost
be
inseparably
join
!
<EOS>
Her
deplorable
situation
fill
my
breast
with
compassion
,
and
every
tender
idea
reviving
in
my
imagination
,
I
fly
into
her
embrace
;
she
know
me
immediately
,
and
strain
me
gently
in
her
arm
,
shed
a
torrent
of
tear
,
which
I
could
not
help
encrease
:
<EOS>
at
length
,
cast
a
languishing
look
at
me
,
she
pronounce
with
a
feeble
voice
,
"
dear
Mr
Random
,
I
do
not
deserve
this
concern
at
your
hand
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
vile
creature
,
who
have
a
base
design
upon
your
person
 
<EOS>
suffer
me
to
expiate
that
and
all
my
other
crime
by
a
miserable
death
,
which
will
not
fail
to
overtake
me
in
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
encourage
her
as
much
as
I
could
,
tell
her
I
forgave
all
the
injury
she
have
design
for
me
;
and
that
although
my
circumstance
be
extremely
low
,
I
would
share
my
last
farthing
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
beg
to
know
the
immediate
cause
of
that
fit
from
which
she
have
just
recover
,
and
I
would
endeavour
by
my
skill
to
prevent
any
more
such
attack
.
     
<EOS>
She
seem
very
much
affect
with
what
I
say
,
take
my
hand
and
press
it
to
her
lip
,
say
,
"
You
be
too
generous
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
live
to
express
my
gratitude
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
I
perish
for
want
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
shut
her
eye
,
relapse
into
another
swoon
.
 
<EOS>
such
extremity
of
distress
must
have
wake
the
most
obdurate
heart
to
sympathy
and
compassion
:
what
effect
then
must
it
have
on
mine
,
that
be
naturally
prone
to
every
tender
passion
?
<EOS>
I
run
down
stair
and
send
my
landlady
to
a
chymist
's
shop
for
some
cinnamon
-
water
,
while
I
return
to
this
unfortunate
creature
's
chamber
,
use
all
the
mean
in
my
power
to
bring
her
to
herself
,
which
with
much
difficulty
I
accomplish
,
and
make
her
drink
a
glass
of
the
cordial
to
recruit
her
spirit
;
then
I
prepare
a
little
mulled
red
wine
and
a
toast
,
which
have
take
,
she
find
herself
thoroughly
revive
,
and
inform
me
,
that
she
have
not
taste
food
for
eight
and
forty
hour
before
.
     
<EOS>
as
I
be
impatient
to
know
the
occasion
and
nature
of
her
calamity
,
she
give
me
to
understand
that
she
be
a
woman
of
the
town
by
profession
 
<EOS>
that
in
the
course
of
her
adventure
,
she
find
herself
dangerously
infect
with
a
distemper
to
which
all
of
her
class
be
particularly
subject
;
 
that
her
malady
gain
ground
every
day
,
she
be
become
loathsome
to
herself
as
well
as
to
every
one
else
,
when
she
resolve
to
retire
to
some
obscure
corner
,
where
she
may
be
cure
with
as
little
noise
and
expence
as
possible
;
 
that
she
have
accordingly
choose
this
place
of
retreat
,
and
put
herself
into
the
hand
of
an
advertising
doctor
,
who
have
fleece
her
of
all
the
money
she
have
,
or
could
procure
,
leave
her
three
day
ago
in
a
bad
condition
than
that
in
which
he
find
her
;
 
<EOS>
that
except
the
cloath
on
her
back
,
she
have
pawn
or
sell
every
thing
that
belong
to
her
,
to
satisfy
that
rapacious
quack
,
and
quiet
the
clamour
of
her
landlady
,
who
still
persist
in
her
threat
to
turn
her
out
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
after
have
moralize
upon
these
particular
,
I
propose
that
she
should
lodge
in
the
same
room
with
me
,
which
would
save
some
money
;
and
assure
her
I
would
myself
undertake
her
cure
as
well
as
my
own
,
during
which
she
should
partake
of
all
the
conveniencie
I
could
afford
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
embrace
my
offer
with
unfeigned
acknowledgment
,
and
I
begin
to
put
it
in
practice
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
to
my
great
satisfaction
,
in
her
,
not
only
an
agreeable
companion
,
whose
conversation
greatly
alleviate
my
chagrin
,
but
also
a
careful
nurse
,
who
serve
me
with
the
utmost
fidelity
and
affection
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
while
I
testify
my
surprise
that
a
woman
of
her
beauty
,
good
sense
,
and
education
(
for
she
have
a
large
portion
of
each
)
could
be
reduce
to
such
an
infamous
and
miserable
way
of
life
as
that
of
a
prostitute
;
she
answer
with
a
sigh
,
"
these
very
advantage
be
the
cause
of
my
undoing
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
remarkable
reply
inflame
my
curiosity
to
such
a
degree
,
that
I
beg
she
would
favour
me
with
the
particular
of
her
story
,
and
she
comply
in
these
word
.
   
<EOS>
chapter
xxii
<EOS>
the
history
of
Miss
Williams
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
an
eminent
merchant
in
the
city
,
who
have
,
in
the
course
of
trade
,
suffer
very
considerable
loss
,
retire
in
his
old
age
with
his
wife
to
a
small
estate
in
the
country
,
which
he
have
purchase
with
the
remain
of
his
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
time
I
be
but
<EOS>
eight
year
of
age
,
be
leave
in
town
for
the
convenience
of
education
;
board
with
an
aunt
,
who
be
a
rigid
Presbyterian
,
and
who
confine
me
so
closely
to
what
she
call
the
duty
of
religion
,
that
in
time
I
grow
weary
of
her
doctrine
,
and
by
degree
conceive
an
aversion
for
the
good
book
she
daily
recommend
to
my
perusal
.
<EOS>
as
I
increase
in
age
,
and
appear
with
a
person
not
disagreeable
,
I
contract
a
good
deal
of
acquaintance
among
my
own
sex
;
one
of
whom
,
after
have
lament
the
restraint
I
be
under
from
the
narrowness
of
my
aunt
's
sentiment
,
tell
me
,
I
must
now
throw
off
the
prejudice
of
opinion
imbibe
under
her
influence
and
example
,
and
learn
to
think
for
myself
;
 
for
which
purpose
she
advise
me
to
read
Locke
,
Shaftsbury
,
Tindal
,
Hobbs
,
and
all
the
book
that
be
remarkable
for
their
deviation
from
the
old
way
of
thinking
,
and
by
compare
one
with
another
,
I
would
soon
be
able
to
form
a
system
of
my
own
.
     
<EOS>
I
follow
her
advice
,
and
whether
it
be
owe
to
my
prepossession
against
what
I
have
formerly
read
,
or
the
clearness
of
argument
in
these
my
new
instructor
,
I
know
not
,
but
I
study
them
with
pleasure
,
and
in
a
short
time
become
a
professed
Free
-
thinker
.
<EOS>
proud
of
my
new
improvement
,
I
argue
in
all
company
,
and
that
with
such
success
,
that
I
soon
acquire
the
reputation
of
a
philosopher
,
and
few
people
durst
undertake
me
in
a
dispute
.
 
<EOS>
I
grow
vain
upon
my
good
fortune
,
and
at
length
pretend
to
make
my
aunt
a
proselyte
to
my
opinion
;
but
she
no
sooner
perceive
my
drift
,
than
take
the
alarm
,
she
write
to
my
father
an
account
of
my
heresy
,
and
conjure
him
,
as
he
tender
the
good
of
my
soul
,
to
remove
me
immediately
from
the
dangerous
place
where
I
have
contract
such
sinful
principle
:
accordingly
,
my
father
order
me
into
the
country
,
where
I
arrive
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
my
age
,
and
by
his
command
,
give
him
a
detail
of
all
the
article
of
my
faith
,
which
he
do
not
find
so
unreasonable
as
they
have
be
represent
.
 
<EOS>
find
myself
suddenly
deprive
of
the
company
and
pleasure
of
the
town
,
I
grow
melancholy
,
and
it
be
some
time
before
I
could
relish
my
situation
.
 
<EOS>
but
solitude
become
every
day
more
and
more
familiar
to
me
,
and
I
console
myself
in
my
retreat
with
the
enjoyment
of
a
good
library
,
at
such
time
as
be
not
employ
in
the
management
of
the
family
,
<EOS>
(
for
my
mother
have
be
dead
three
year
)
in
visit
,
or
some
other
party
of
rural
diversion
.
 
<EOS>
have
more
imagination
than
judgment
,
I
addict
myself
too
much
to
poetry
and
romance
;
and
in
short
be
look
upon
as
a
very
extraordinary
person
by
every
body
in
the
country
where
I
reside
.
     
<EOS>
I
have
one
evening
stray
with
a
book
in
my
hand
,
into
a
wood
that
border
on
the
high
road
,
at
a
little
distance
from
my
father
's
house
;
when
a
certain
drunken
"
squire
,
ride
by
,
perceive
me
,
and
cry
,
"
Z####ds
!
<EOS>
there
be
a
charming
creature
!
"
<EOS>
alight
in
a
moment
,
catch
me
in
his
arm
,
and
treat
me
so
rudely
,
that
I
shriek
as
loud
as
I
could
,
and
in
the
mean
time
oppose
his
violence
with
all
the
strength
that
rage
and
resentment
could
inspire
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
struggle
,
another
horseman
come
up
,
who
see
a
lady
so
unworthily
use
,
dismount
and
fly
to
my
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
My
ravish
,
mad
with
disappointment
,
or
provoke
with
the
reproach
of
the
other
gentleman
,
quit
me
,
and
run
to
his
horse
,
draw
a
pistol
from
the
saddle
and
fire
it
at
my
protector
,
who
happily
receive
no
damage
,
go
up
,
and
with
the
butt
end
of
his
whip
,
lay
him
prostrate
on
the
ground
,
before
he
could
use
the
other
,
which
his
antagonist
immediately
seize
,
and
clap
to
the
"
squire
's
breast
,
threatne
to
put
him
to
death
for
his
cowardice
and
treachery
:
<EOS>
upon
this
I
interpose
and
beg
his
life
,
which
be
grant
to
my
request
,
after
he
have
ask
pardon
,
and
swear
his
intention
be
only
to
obtain
a
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
my
defender
think
proper
to
unload
the
other
pistol
,
and
throw
away
the
flint
,
before
he
give
him
his
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
this
courteous
stranger
conduct
me
home
,
where
my
father
have
learn
the
signal
service
he
have
do
me
,
load
him
with
caress
,
and
insist
on
his
lodging
that
night
at
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
obligation
he
have
confer
upon
me
justly
inspire
me
with
sentiment
of
gratitude
,
his
appearance
and
conversation
seem
to
intitle
him
to
somewhat
more
.
     
<EOS>
He
be
about
the
age
of
two
and
twenty
,
among
the
tall
of
the
middle
-
size
;
have
chesnut
coloured
hair
which
he
wear
tie
up
in
a
ribbon
;
a
high
polished
fore
-
head
,
a
nose
incline
to
the
aquiline
,
lively
blue
eye
,
red
pouting
lip
,
tooth
as
white
as
snow
,
and
a
certain
openness
of
countenance
,
 
but
<EOS>
what
need
I
describe
any
more
particular
of
his
person
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
I
do
not
flatter
,
when
I
say
he
be
the
exact
resemblance
of
you
;
and
if
I
have
not
be
well
acquaint
with
his
family
and
pedigree
,
I
should
have
make
no
scruple
of
conclude
him
your
brother
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
little
,
and
seem
to
have
no
reserve
,
for
what
he
say
be
ingenuous
,
sensible
,
and
uncommon
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
(
say
she
,
burst
into
tear
)
<EOS>
he
be
form
for
the
ruin
of
our
sex
.
 
<EOS>
His
behaviour
be
modest
and
respectful
,
but
his
look
be
so
significant
that
I
could
easily
observe
,
he
secretly
bless
the
occasion
that
introduce
him
to
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
We
learn
from
his
discourse
that
he
be
eld
son
of
a
wealthy
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
to
whose
name
<EOS>
we
be
no
stranger
;
that
he
have
be
to
visit
an
acquaintance
in
the
country
,
from
whose
house
he
be
return
home
,
when
my
shriek
bring
him
to
my
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
all
night
long
my
imagination
form
a
thousand
ridiculous
expectation
:
    
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
of
knight
-
errantry
in
this
gentleman
be
come
to
the
relief
of
a
damsel
in
distress
,
with
whom
he
immediately
become
enamoured
,
that
all
I
have
read
of
love
and
chivalry
recur
to
my
fancy
,
and
I
look
upon
myself
as
a
princess
in
some
region
of
romance
,
who
be
deliver
from
the
power
of
a
brutal
giant
or
satyr
by
a
generous
Oroondates
,
be
bind
in
gratitude
,
as
well
as
lead
by
inclination
,
to
yield
up
my
affection
to
him
without
reserve
.
<EOS>
in
vain
do
I
endeavour
to
chastise
these
foolish
conceit
by
reflexion
more
reasonable
and
severe
:
<EOS>
the
amusing
image
take
full
possession
of
my
mind
,
and
my
dream
represent
my
hero
sigh
at
my
foot
,
in
the
language
of
a
despairing
lover
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
after
breakfast
he
take
his
leave
,
when
my
father
beg
the
favour
of
a
further
acquaintance
with
him
;
to
which
he
reply
by
a
compliment
to
him
,
and
a
look
to
me
so
full
of
eloquence
and
tenderness
,
that
my
whole
soul
receive
the
soft
impression
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
short
time
he
repeat
his
visit
;
and
as
a
recital
of
the
particular
step
he
pursue
to
ruin
me
,
would
be
too
tedious
and
impertinent
,
let
it
suffice
to
say
,
he
make
it
his
business
to
insinuate
himself
into
my
esteem
,
by
convince
me
of
his
own
good
sense
,
and
at
the
same
time
flatter
my
understanding
:
this
he
perform
in
the
most
artful
manner
,
by
seem
to
contradict
me
often
through
misapprehension
,
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
of
clear
myself
,
the
more
to
my
own
honour
.
 
<EOS>
have
thus
secure
my
good
opinion
,
he
begin
to
give
me
some
token
of
a
particular
passion
found
on
a
veneration
for
the
quality
of
my
mind
,
and
as
an
accidental
ornament
,
admir'd
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
my
person
;
till
at
length
,
be
fully
persuade
of
his
conquest
,
he
choose
a
a
proper
season
for
the
theme
,
and
disclos'd
his
love
in
term
so
ardent
and
sincere
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
disguise
the
sentiment
of
my
heart
,
and
he
receive
my
approbation
with
the
most
lively
transport
.
    
<EOS>
after
this
mutual
declaration
,
we
contrive
to
meet
more
frequently
,
which
we
do
in
private
interview
,
where
we
enjoy'd
<EOS>
the
conversation
of
one
another
,
in
all
the
elevation
of
fancy
and
impatience
of
hope
,
that
reciprocal
adoration
can
inspire
.
 
<EOS>
He
profess
his
honourable
intention
,
of
which
I
make
no
question
,
lament
the
avaritious
disposition
of
his
father
,
who
have
destin'd
him
for
the
arm
of
another
,
and
vow
eternal
fidelity
with
such
an
appearance
of
candour
and
devotion
,
that
I
become
a
dupe
to
his
deceit
,
and
in
an
evil
hour
crown
his
eager
desire
with
full
possession
.
 
<EOS>
Cursed
be
the
day
on
which
I
give
away
my
innocence
and
peace
,
for
a
momentary
gratification
which
have
entail
upon
me
such
misery
and
horror
!
<EOS>
curse
be
my
beauty
that
first
attract
the
attention
of
the
seducer
!
<EOS>
curse
be
my
education
,
that
by
refine
my
sentiment
,
make
my
heart
the
more
susceptible
!
<EOS>
curse
be
my
good
sense
that
fix
me
to
one
object
,
and
teach
me
the
preference
I
enjoy
be
but
my
due
!
<EOS>
have
I
be
ugly
,
no
body
would
have
tempt
me
;
have
I
be
ignorant
,
the
charm
of
my
person
would
not
have
atone
for
the
coarseness
of
my
conversation
;
have
I
be
giddy
,
my
vanity
would
have
divide
my
inclination
,
and
my
idea
would
have
be
so
diffuse
,
that
I
should
never
have
listen
to
the
enchantment
of
one
alone
.
    
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
unfortunate
story
;
we
give
a
loose
to
guilty
pleasure
,
which
for
some
month
banish
every
other
concern
.
 
<EOS>
but
by
degree
,
his
visit
become
less
frequent
,
and
his
behaviour
less
warm
:
I
perceive
his
coldness
,
my
heart
take
the
alarm
,
my
tear
reproach
him
,
and
I
insist
upon
the
performance
of
his
promise
to
espouse
me
,
that
whatever
should
happen
,
my
reputation
may
be
safe
:
    
<EOS>
He
seem
to
acquiesce
in
my
proposal
,
and
leave
me
on
pretence
of
find
a
proper
clergyman
to
unite
us
in
the
band
of
wedlock
.
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
the
Inconstant
have
no
intention
to
return
:
I
wait
a
whole
week
with
the
utmost
impatience
;
sometimes
doubt
his
honour
,
at
other
time
invent
excuse
for
him
,
and
condemn
myself
for
harbour
the
least
suspicion
of
his
faith
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
I
understand
from
a
gentleman
who
dine
at
our
house
,
that
this
perfidious
wretch
be
on
the
point
of
set
out
for
London
with
his
bride
,
to
buy
cloath
for
their
approach
nuptial
.
 
<EOS>
this
information
distract
me
!
<EOS>
the
more
so
,
as
I
find
myself
some
month
go
with
child
,
and
reflect
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
conceal
my
disgrace
,
which
would
not
only
ruin
the
character
I
have
acquire
in
the
country
,
but
also
bring
the
grey
hair
of
an
indulgent
parent
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
rage
take
possession
of
my
soul
;
I
denounce
a
thousand
imprecation
,
and
form
as
many
scheme
of
revenge
against
the
traitor
who
have
undo
me
!
<EOS>
then
my
resentment
would
subside
to
silent
sorrow
:
I
recall
the
tranquility
I
have
lose
,
I
weep
over
my
infatuation
,
and
sometimes
a
ray
of
hope
would
intervene
,
and
for
a
moment
cheer
my
drooping
heart
;
I
would
revolve
all
the
favourable
circumstance
of
his
character
,
repeat
the
vow
he
make
,
ascribe
his
absence
to
the
vigilance
of
a
suspicious
father
,
who
compel
him
to
a
match
his
soul
abhor
,
and
comfort
myself
with
the
expectation
of
see
him
before
the
thing
should
be
bring
to
any
term
of
agreement
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
vain
be
my
imagination
?
<EOS>
the
villain
leave
me
without
remorse
,
and
in
a
few
day
the
news
of
his
marriage
spread
all
over
the
country
.
     
<EOS>
My
horror
be
then
inconceivable
!
<EOS>
and
have
not
the
desire
of
revenge
divert
the
resolution
,
I
should
infallibly
have
put
an
end
to
my
miserable
life
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
observe
the
symptom
of
my
despair
;
and
though
I
have
good
reason
to
believe
,
he
guess
the
cause
,
be
at
a
great
deal
of
pain
to
seem
ignorant
of
my
affliction
,
while
he
endeavour
with
paternal
fondness
to
alleviate
my
distress
.
<EOS>
I
see
his
concern
,
which
increase
my
anguish
,
and
raise
my
fury
against
the
author
of
my
calamity
,
to
an
implacable
degree
.
<EOS>
have
furnish
myself
with
a
little
money
,
I
make
an
elopement
from
this
unhappy
parent
in
the
night
-
time
,
and
about
break
of
day
,
arrive
at
a
small
town
from
whence
<EOS>
a
stage
-
coach
set
out
for
London
,
in
which
I
embark
,
and
next
day
alight
in
town
;
the
spirit
of
revenge
have
support
me
all
the
way
against
every
other
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
My
first
care
be
to
hire
a
lodging
,
in
which
I
keep
myself
very
retired
,
have
assume
a
feign
name
,
that
my
character
and
situation
may
be
the
better
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
I
find
out
the
house
of
my
ravisher
<EOS>
,
whither
I
immediately
repair
in
a
transport
of
rage
,
determine
to
act
some
desperate
deed
for
the
satisfaction
of
my
despair
,
though
the
hurry
of
my
spirit
would
not
permit
me
to
concert
or
resolve
upon
a
particular
plan
.
<EOS>
when
I
demand
admission
to
Lothario
(
so
let
me
call
him
)
<EOS>
I
be
desire
to
send
up
my
name
and
business
;
but
this
I
refuse
,
tell
the
porter
I
have
business
for
his
master
's
private
ear
:
upon
which
I
be
conduct
into
a
parlour
until
he
should
be
inform
of
my
request
.
     
<EOS>
there
I
remain
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
a
servant
enter
and
tell
me
his
master
be
engage
with
company
,
and
beg
to
be
excuse
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
My
temper
could
hold
out
no
longer
:
I
pull
a
poignard
from
my
bosom
where
I
have
conceal
it
,
and
rush
out
,
fly
up
stair
like
a
fury
,
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
where
be
this
perfidious
villain
!
<EOS>
could
I
once
plunge
this
dagger
into
his
false
heart
,
I
would
then
die
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
noise
I
make
alarmed
not
only
the
servant
,
but
the
company
also
,
who
hear
my
threat
,
come
forwards
to
the
stair
-
case
to
see
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
be
seize
,
disarm
,
and
with
-
hold
by
two
footman
;
in
this
situation
I
feel
the
most
exquisite
torture
in
behold
my
undoer
approach
with
his
young
wife
;
I
could
not
endure
the
sight
,
be
deprive
of
my
sense
,
and
fall
into
a
severe
fit
,
during
which
I
know
not
how
I
be
treat
;
but
when
I
recover
the
use
of
reflection
,
find
myself
on
a
bed
in
a
paultry
apartment
,
where
I
be
attend
by
an
old
woman
,
who
ask
a
thousand
impertinent
question
relate
to
my
condition
;
and
inform
me
that
my
behaviour
have
throw
the
whole
family
into
confusion
;
that
Lothario
affirm
I
be
mad
,
and
pretend
to
have
me
send
to
Bedlam
;
but
my
lady
persuade
herself
there
be
more
in
my
conduct
than
he
care
should
be
know
,
and
have
take
to
her
bed
on
bare
suspicion
,
have
first
order
that
I
should
be
narrowly
look
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
all
she
say
without
make
any
other
reply
,
than
desire
she
would
do
me
the
favour
to
call
a
chair
;
but
this
(
she
tell
me
)
could
not
be
do
without
her
master
's
consent
,
which
,
however
,
be
easily
procure
,
and
I
be
convey
to
my
own
lodging
in
a
state
of
mind
that
baffle
all
description
.
    
<EOS>
the
agitation
of
my
thought
produce
a
fever
,
which
bring
on
a
miscarriage
;
and
I
believe
it
be
well
for
my
conscience
that
heaven
thus
dispose
of
my
burden
;
for
let
me
own
to
you
with
penitence
and
horror
,
if
I
have
bring
a
live
child
into
the
world
,
my
frenzy
would
have
prompt
me
to
sacrifice
the
little
innocent
to
my
resentment
of
the
wrong
<EOS>
do
me
by
the
father
.
    
<EOS>
after
this
event
my
rage
abate
,
and
my
hate
become
more
deliberate
and
calm
;
when
one
day
,
my
landlady
inform
me
that
there
be
a
gentleman
below
who
desire
to
see
me
,
have
something
of
consequence
to
impart
,
which
he
be
sure
would
contribute
to
my
peace
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
alarm
at
this
declaration
,
which
I
attempt
to
interpret
a
thousand
way
;
and
before
I
come
to
any
determination
he
enter
my
room
,
with
an
apology
for
intrude
upon
me
against
my
knowledge
or
consent
.
 
<EOS>
I
survey
him
some
time
,
but
could
not
remember
to
have
see
him
before
;
then
with
a
faultere
accent
,
demand
what
be
his
business
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
upon
which
,
he
desire
I
would
give
him
a
particular
audience
,
and
he
do
not
doubt
of
communicate
something
that
would
conduce
to
my
satisfaction
and
repose
.
<EOS>
as
I
think
myself
sufficiently
guard
against
any
violence
,
I
grant
his
request
,
and
bid
the
woman
withdraw
.
     
<EOS>
the
stranger
then
advance
,
give
me
to
understand
that
he
be
well
acquaint
with
the
particular
of
my
story
,
have
be
inform
of
them
from
Lothario
's
own
mouth
 
that
from
the
time
he
know
my
misfortune
,
he
have
entertain
a
detestation
for
the
author
of
them
;
which
have
of
late
be
increase
and
inflame
to
a
desire
of
revenge
,
by
a
piece
of
dishonourable
conduct
towards
him
 
that
hearing
of
my
melancholy
situation
,
he
have
come
with
an
intention
of
offer
his
assistance
and
comfort
,
and
be
ready
to
espouse
my
quarrel
and
forthwith
take
vengeance
on
my
seducer
,
provide
I
would
grant
him
one
consideration
,
which
(
he
hope
)
<EOS>
I
should
see
no
reason
to
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
have
all
the
artifice
of
hell
be
employ
in
compose
a
persuasive
,
it
could
not
have
have
a
more
instantaneous
or
favourable
effect
than
this
discourse
have
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
transport
with
a
delirium
of
gloomy
joy
;
I
hug
my
companion
in
my
arm
,
and
vow
that
if
he
would
make
good
his
promise
,
my
soul
and
body
should
be
at
his
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
the
contract
be
make
;
he
devote
himself
to
my
revenge
,
undertake
to
murder
Lothario
that
very
night
,
and
to
bring
me
an
account
of
his
death
before
morning
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
about
two
of
the
clock
,
he
be
introduce
to
my
chamber
,
and
assure
me
my
perfidious
lover
be
no
more
;
that
although
he
be
not
entitle
to
such
an
honourable
proceeding
,
he
have
fairly
challenge
him
to
the
field
,
where
he
upbraid
him
with
his
treachery
towards
me
,
for
whom
(
he
tell
him
)
<EOS>
his
sword
be
draw
,
and
after
a
few
pass
,
leave
him
welter
in
his
blood
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
savage
by
my
wrong
,
that
I
delight
in
the
recital
of
this
adventure
,
make
him
repeat
the
particular
,
feast
my
eye
with
the
blood
that
remain
on
his
cloath
and
sword
,
and
yield
up
my
body
as
a
recompence
for
the
service
he
have
do
me
.
<EOS>
My
imagination
be
so
engross
by
these
idea
,
that
in
my
sleep
I
dream
Lothario
appear
before
me
,
pale
,
mangled
and
bloody
,
blame
my
rashness
,
protest
his
innocence
,
and
plead
his
own
cause
so
pathetically
,
that
I
be
convince
of
his
fidelity
,
and
wake
in
a
fit
of
horror
and
remorse
.
     
<EOS>
My
bed
-
fellow
endeavour
to
sooth
,
console
,
and
persuade
me
that
I
have
but
barely
do
justice
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
dropt
asleep
again
,
and
the
same
apparition
recur
to
my
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
pass
the
night
in
great
misery
,
and
look
upon
my
avenger
with
such
abhorrence
,
that
in
the
morning
,
perceive
my
aversion
,
he
insinuate
there
be
still
a
possibility
of
Lothario
's
recovery
;
it
be
true
,
he
leave
him
wound
on
the
ground
,
but
not
quite
dead
;
and
perhaps
his
hurt
may
not
be
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
at
these
word
I
start
up
,
bid
him
fly
for
intelligence
,
and
if
he
could
not
bring
me
tiding
of
Lothario
's
safety
,
at
least
consult
his
own
and
never
return
,
for
I
be
resolve
to
surrender
myself
to
justice
,
and
declare
all
that
I
know
of
the
affair
,
that
,
if
possible
,
I
may
expiate
my
own
guilt
,
by
incur
the
rigours
of
a
sincere
repentance
and
ignominious
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
very
coolly
represent
the
unreasonableness
of
my
prejudice
against
him
,
who
have
do
nothing
but
what
his
love
of
me
inspire
,
and
honour
justify
;
 
that
now
he
have
at
the
risk
of
his
life
,
be
subservient
to
my
revenge
<EOS>
,
I
be
about
to
discard
him
as
an
infamous
agent
occasionally
necessary
:
and
that
even
if
he
should
be
so
lucky
as
to
bring
news
of
Lothario
's
safety
,
it
be
probable
my
former
resentment
may
revive
,
and
I
would
upbraid
him
with
have
fail
in
his
undertaking
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
would
be
dearer
to
me
than
ever
,
as
I
should
be
convince
he
act
more
on
the
principle
of
a
man
of
honour
,
than
on
those
of
a
mercenary
assassin
,
and
scorn
to
take
away
the
life
of
an
adversary
(
how
inveterate
soever
)
which
fortune
have
put
in
his
power
.
     
<EOS>
"
well
then
,
madam
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
whatever
may
have
happen
,
I
shall
find
it
no
difficult
to
satisfy
you
in
that
.
"
 
and
take
his
leave
,
in
order
to
enquire
into
the
consequence
of
his
duel
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
now
more
sensible
than
ever
of
the
degree
of
guilt
and
misery
;
all
the
affliction
I
have
suffer
hitherto
be
owe
to
my
own
credulity
and
weakness
,
and
my
conscience
could
only
accuse
me
of
venal
crime
;
but
now
that
I
look
upon
myself
as
a
murderer
,
it
be
impossible
to
express
the
terror
of
my
imagination
,
which
be
incessantly
haunt
by
the
image
of
the
deceased
,
and
my
bosom
sting
with
the
most
exquisite
agony
,
of
which
I
see
no
end
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
Horatio
(
for
so
I
shall
call
my
keeper
)
return
,
and
tell
me
I
have
nothing
to
fear
,
deliver
into
my
hand
a
billet
contain
these
word
.
    
<EOS>
Madam

"
<EOS>
as
I
understand
it
be
of
consequence
to
your
peace
,
I
take
this
liberty
to
inform
you
,
that
the
wound
I
receive
from
Horatio
be
not
mortal
.
<EOS>
this
satisfaction
my
humanity
could
not
deny
even
to
a
person
who
have
endeavour
to
disturb
the
repose
,
as
well
destroy
the
life
of

Lothario

<EOS>
be
well
acquaint
with
his
hand
,
I
have
no
reason
to
suspect
an
imposition
in
this
letter
,
which
I
read
over
and
over
with
a
transport
of
joy
,
and
caress
Horatio
so
much
,
that
he
appear
the
happy
man
alive

<EOS>
thus
be
I
win
from
despair
by
the
menace
of
a
great
misfortune
than
that
which
depress
me
.
 
<EOS>
Griefs
be
like
usurper
,
the
most
powerful
depose
all
the
rest
 
<EOS>
but
my
rapture
be
not
last
 
<EOS>
that
very
letter
which
in
a
manner
re
-
establish
my
tranquility
,
in
a
little
time
banish
my
peace
.
 
<EOS>
His
unjust
reproach
,
while
they
wake
my
resentment
,
recall
my
former
happiness
,
and
fill
my
soul
with
rage
and
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Horatio
,
perceive
the
situation
of
my
mind
,
endeavour
to
divert
my
chagrin
,
by
treat
me
with
all
the
amusement
and
entertainment
of
the
town

<EOS>
I
be
gratify
with
every
indulgence
I
could
desire
;
introduce
into
the
company
of
other
keep
-
mistress
,
by
whom
an
uncommon
deference
be
pay
me
;
and
I
begin
to
lose
all
remembrance
of
my
former
condition
,
when
an
accident
bring
it
back
to
my
view
with
all
its
interesting
circumstance

divert
myself
one
day
with
some
news

which
I
have
not

the

advertisement
attract
my
attention

<EOS>
"
whereas
a
young
gentlewoman
disappear
from
her
father
's
house
,
in
the
county
of
 
,
about
the
end
of
September
,
on
account
(
as
be
suppose
)
of
some
uneasiness
of
mind
,
and
have
not
be

yet
hear
of
;
whoever
will
give
an
information
about
her
,
to
Mr

Gray's

Inn

if
she
will

to

of

disconsolate
parent

she
will
be
receive
with
the
utmost
tenderness
,
whatever
reason
she
may
have
to
think
otherwise
,
and
may
be
the
mean
of
prolong
the
life
of
a
father

already
weigh
down
almost
to
the
grave
with
age
and
sorrow
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
pathetic
remonstrance
have
such
an
effect
on
me
,
that
I
be
fully
resolve
to
return
like
the
prodigal
son
,
and
implore
the
forgiveness
of
him
who
give
me
life
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
upon
inquiry
,
I
find
he
have
pay
his
debt
to
nature
a
month
before
,
lament
my
absence
to
his
last
hour
,
have
leave
his
fortune
to
a
stranger
as
a
mark
of
his
resentment
of
my
unkind
and
undutiful
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
penetrate
with
remorse
on
this
occasion
,
I
sink
into
the
most
profound
melancholy
,
and
consider
myself
as
the
immediate
cause
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
lose
all
relish
for
company
,
and
indeed
most
of
my
acquaintance
no
sooner
perceive
my
change
of
temper
,
than
they
abandon
me
.
<EOS>
Horatio
,
disgust
at
my
insensibility
,
or
(
which
be
more
probable
)
cloy
with
possession
,
become
cold
and
cold
every
day
,
till
at
last
he
leave
me
altogether
,
without
make
any
apology
for
his
conduct
;
or
secure
me
against
the
misery
of
want
,
as
a
man
of
honour
ought
to
have
do
,
consider
the
share
he
have
in
my
ruin
;
for
I
afterwards
learn
that
the
quarrel
between
Lothario
and
him
,
be
a
story
trump
up
to
rid
the
one
of
my
importunity
,
and
give
the
other
the
enjoyment
of
my
person

which
,
it
seem
,
he
lust
after
,
upon
see
me
at
the
house
of
my
seducer
.
 
<EOS>
reduce
to
this
extremity
,
I
curse
my
own
simplicity
,
uttered
horrid
imprecation
against
the
treachery
of
Horatio
;
and
as
I
become
every
day
more
and
more
familiarized
to
the
loss
of
innocence
,
resolve
to
be
revenge
on
the
sex
in
general
,
by
practise
their
own
art
upon
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
an
opportunity
long
want
:
    
an
old
gentlewoman
,
under
pretence
of
sympathizing
,
visit
me
,
and
after
have
condole
with
me
on
my
misfortune
,
and
profess
a
disinterested
friendship
,
begin
to
display
the
art
of
her
occupation
,
in
encomium
on
my
beauty
,
and
invective
against
the
wretch
who
have
forsake
me
;
insinuate
withal
that
it
would
be
my
own
fault
if
I
do
not
still
make
my
fortune
by
the
extraordinary
qualification
with
which
nature
have
endow
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
understand
her
drift
,
and
give
her
such
encouragement
to
explain
herself
,
that
we
come
to
an
agreement
immediately
to
divide
the
profit
of
my
prostitution
,
accrue
from
such
gallant
as
she
should
introduce

<EOS>
the
first
stroke
of
my
dissimulation

be
practise
upon
a

j####ge
,
to
whom
I
be
recommend
by
this
matron
,
as
an
innocent
creature
just
arrive
from

;
he
be
so
transported
with
my

feign
simplicity

that
he
pay
a
hundred
guinea
for
the
possession
of
me
for
one
night

during

reflection
thereupon

she
make
me
acquaint
with
the
progress
of
a
common
woman
of
the
town
 
resolve
to
quit
that
way
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
Her
story
be
here
interrupt
by
a
rap
at
the
door
,
which
I
no
sooner
open
,
than
three
or
four
terrible
fellow
rush
in
,
one
of
whom
accost
my
fellow
lodger
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
your
servant
 
you
must
do
me
the
favour
to

along
with

<EOS>
I

a
writ
against
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
while
the
bailif
(
for
so
he
be
)
speak
thus
,
his
follower
surround
the
prisoner
,
and
begin
to
handle
her
very
roughly
.
     
<EOS>
this
treatment
incense
me
so
much
,
that
I
snatch
up
the
poker
,
and
would
certainly
have
use
it
in
defence
of
the
lady
,
without
any
regard
to
the
strength
and
number
of
her
adversary
,
<EOS>
have
not
she
beg
me
with
a
composure
of
countenance
,
for
which
I
could
not
account
,
to
use
no
violence
in
her
behalf
,
which
could
be
of
no
service
to
her
,
but
may
be
very
detrimental
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
then
turn
to
the
leader
of
this
formidable
troop
,
she
desire
to
see
the
warrant
,
and
have
peruse
it
,
say
with
a
faultere
voice
,
"
I
be
not
the

arrest
me
at
your

"
 
<EOS>
"
ay

<EOS>

whether

<EOS>
"
if

(
say
she
)
<EOS>
I
would
rather

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

well

if
you

<EOS>
but
when
she
acquaint
him
with
her
poverty
,
he
swear
he
never
give
credit
,
and
order
one
of
his
myrmidon
to
call
a
coach
to
carry
her
to
the

at
once

<EOS>
while
this
be
a
doing
she
take
me
aside
,
and
bid
me
be
under
no
concern
on
her
account
,
for
she
know
how
to
extricate
herself
from
this
difficulty
very
soon
,
and
perhaps
gain
something
by
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
although
her
discourse
be
a
mystery
to
me
,
I
be
very
well
pleased
with
her
assurance
,
and
when
the
coach
come
to
the
door
,
offer
to
accompany
her
to
prison

to
which

after
much
intreaty

when

our

demand

so
say
he
open
the

door
,

help
her
to
dismount
;
but
when
he
observe
her
face

he
start
back

say
,
"

<EOS>
the

cry
with
some
emotion
,
"
who
the

the

word
for
it
at
first
,
he
may
have
save
himself
and
her
a
great
deal
of
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
(
answer
he
)
but
by
g
-
d
,
I
will
have
further
evidence
that
you
be
not
the
person
before
you
and
I
part
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
you
shall
have
further
evidence
to
your
cost
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
this
we
adjourn
into
the
lodge
,
and
call
for
a
bottle
of
wine
,
where
my
companion
write
a
direction
to
two
of
her
acquaintance
,
and
beg
the
favour
of
me
to
go
to
their
lodging
,
and
request
them
to
come
to
her
immediately
:
I
find
them
together
at
a
house
in
Bridges
's
street
,
Drury
-
lane
,
and
as
they
be
luckily
unengage
,
they
set
out
with
me
in
a
hackney
-
coach
without
hesitation
,
after
I
have
relate
the
circumstance
of
the
affair
,
which
flatter
them
with
hope
of
see
a
bailif
trounce
;
for
there
be
an
antipathy
as
natural
between
the
whore
and
bailifs
,
as
that
subsist
between
mouse
and
cat
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
they
enter
the
lodge
,
they
embrace
the
prisoner
very
affectionately
by
the
name
of
Nancy
Williams
;
and
ask
how
long
she
have
be
nabb'd
,
and
for
what
?
     
<EOS>
on
hear
the
particular
of
her
adventure
repeat
,
they
offer
to
swear
before
a
justice
of
peace
that
she
be
not
the
person
mention
in
the
writ
,
whom
,
it
seem
,
they
all
know
;
but
the
bailif
,
who
by
this
time
be
convince
of
his
mistake
,
tell
them
he
would
not
put
them
to
that
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ladies
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
there
be
no
harm
do
 
<EOS>
you
shall
give
me
leave
to
treat
you
with
another
bottle
,
and
then
we
will
part
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
not
at
all
relish
by
the
sisterhood
;
and
miss
Williams
tell
him
:
sure
he
do
not
imagine
her
such
a
fool
as
to
be
satisfied
with
a
paultry
glass
of
sour
wine
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
turnkey
interrupt
her
,
by
affirm
with
an
oath
,
that
the
wine
be
as
good
as
ever
be
tip
over
tongue

<EOS>
"
well
(
continue
she
)
<EOS>
that
may
be
 
but
be
it
the
good
of

no
recompence

I

in

at

out
of
malice

private
pique

may
injure

the

thank
heaven

I
live
under
the
protection

will

unpunished

<EOS>
Mr
Vulture
(
for
that
be
the
bailif
's
name
)
<EOS>
find
he
have
to
deal
with
one
who
would
not
be
impose
upon
,
begin
to
look
very
sullen
and
perplex
,
and
lean
his
fore

head
on
his
hand
,
enter
into
a
deliberation
with
himself
,
which
last
a
few
minute
,
and
then
break
out
in
a
volley
of
dreadful
curse
against
the
old
b####ch
our
landlady
(
as
he
call
her
)
for
have
misinform
him

<EOS>
after
much
wrangling
and
swear
,
the
matter
be
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
turnkey
,
who
call
for
the
other
bottle
,
mulct
the
bailif
in
all
the
liquor
that
have
be

and
a
couple
of
guinea
for
the
use

<EOS>
the
money
be
immediately
deposit
;
miss
Williams
gratify
the
two
evidence
with
one
half
,
and
put
the
other
in
her
pocket
drive
home
with
me

leave
the
catchpole
grumble
over
his
loss

yet
please
in
the
main

for
have
so
cheaply
get
clear
of
a
business
that
may
have
cost
him
ten
time
the
sum
,
and
his
place
to
boot

<EOS>
this
guinea
be
a
very
seasonable
relief
to
us
,
who
be
reduce
to
great
necessity
,
six
of
my
shirt
and
almost
all
my
cloath
,
except
those
on
my
back
,
be
either
pawn
or
sell
for
our
maintenance
before
this
happen
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
resent
the
behaviour
of
our
landlandy
,
our
first
care
be
to
provide
ourselves
with
another
lodging
<EOS>
,
whither
we
remove
next
day
,
with
an
intention
to
keep
ourselves
as
retire
as
possible
until
our
cure
should
be
compleate
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
be
fix
in
our
new
habitation
,
I
intreate
her
to
finish
the
story
of
her
Life
,
which
she
pursue
in
this
manner
:
    
the
success
of
our
experiment
on
the
J####ge
,
encourage
us
to
practice
the
same
deceit
on
other
,
and
my
virginity
be
five
time
sell
to
good
purpose
;
but
this
harvest
last
not
long
,
my
character
take
air
,
and
my
directress
desert
me
for
some
new
game
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
take
lodging
near
Charing
cross
,
at
two
guinea
per
week
,
and
begin
to
entertain
company
in
a
public
manner
:
 
<EOS>
but
my
income
be
too
small
to
defray
my
expence
,
I
be
oblige
to
retrench
,
and
enter
into
article
with
the
porter
of
certain
tavern
,
who
undertake
to
find
employment
enough
for
me
,
provide
I
would
share
my
profit
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
be
almost
every
night
engage
with
company
,
among
whom
I
be
expose
to
every
mortification
,
danger
and
abuse
that
flow
from
drunkenness
,
brutality
and
disease
.
 
<EOS>
how
miserable
be
the
condition
of
a
courtezan
,
whose
business
it
be
to
sooth
,
suffer
,
and
obey
the
dictate
of
rage
,
insolence
and
lust
!
 
<EOS>
as
my
spirit
be
not
sufficiently
humble
to
the
will
,
nor
my
temper
calculate
for
the
conversation
of
my
gallant
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
overcome
an
aversion
I
feel
for
my
profession
,
which
manifest
itself
in
a
settled
gloom
on
my
countenance
,
and
disgust
these
son
of
mirth
and
riot
so
much
,
that
I
be
frequently
use
in
a
shocking
manner
,
and
kick
down
stair
with
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
the
messenger
see
me
disagreeable
to
their
benefactor
and
employer
,
seldom
trouble
me
with
a
call
,
and
I
begin
to
find
myself
almost
totally
neglect
.
<EOS>
to
contribute
towards
my
support
,
I
be
fain
to
sell
my
watch
,
ring
,
trinket
,
with
the
good
part
of
my
cloath
;
and
I
be
one
evening
muse
by
myself
,
on
the
misery
before
me
,
when
I
receive
a
message
from
a
bagnio
,
whither
<EOS>
I
repair
in
a
chair
,
and
be
introduce
to
a
gentleman
dress
like
an
officer
,
with
whom
I
sup
tete
a
tete
,
in
a
sumptuous
manner
,
and
after
drink
a
hearty
glass
of
champaign
,
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
when
I
awake
<EOS>
I
find
my
gallant
have
get
up
,
and
draw
aside
the
curtain
,
could
not
perceive
him
in
the
room
;
this
give
me
some
uneasiness
,
but
as
he
may
have
retire
on
some
necessary
occasion
,
I
wait
a
full
hour
for
his
return
;
and
then
in
the
great
perplexity
get
up
,
and
ring
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
waiter
come
to
the
door
,
he
find
it
lock
,
and
desire
admittance
,
which
I
grant
,
after
observe
with
great
surprize
that
the
key
remain
on
the
inside
,
as
when
we
go
to
bed
.
     
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
enquire
for
the
captain
,
than
the
fellow
stare
with
a
distracted
look
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
how
,
madam
!
<EOS>
be
he
not
a
-
bed
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
he
be
satisfied
as
to
that
,
run
into
a
closet
adjoin
to
the
chamber
,
the
window
of
which
he
find
open
.
 
<EOS>
through
this
the
adventurer
have
get
upon
a
wall
,
from
whence
he
drop
down
into
a
court
and
escape
;
leave
me
to
be
answerable
,
not
only
for
the
reckoning
,
but
also
for
a
large
silver
tankard
and
posset
-
bowl
,
which
he
have
carry
off
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
describe
the
consternation
I
be
under
,
<EOS>
when
I
see
myself
detain
as
a
thief
's
accomplice
(
for
I
be
look
upon
in
that
light
)
and
carry
before
a
justice
,
who
mistake
my
confusion
for
a
sign
of
guilt
,
commit
me
after
a
short
examination
to
Bridewell
,
have
advise
me
,
as
the
only
mean
to
save
my
life
,
to
turn
evidence
,
and
impeach
my
confederate
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
conclude
,
the
vengeance
of
heaven
have
overtake
me
,
and
that
I
must
soon
finish
my
carreer
by
an
ignominious
death
.
 
<EOS>
this
reflection
sink
so
deep
into
my
soul
,
that
I
be
for
some
day
deprive
of
my
reason
,
and
actually
believe
myself
in
hell
,
torment
by
fiend
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
need
not
a
very
extravagant
imagination
to
form
that
conjecture
;
for
of
all
the
scene
on
earth
,
that
of
Bridewell
approach
near
the
idea
I
have
always
entertain
of
the
infernal
region
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
see
nothing
but
rage
,
anguish
and
impiety
;
and
hear
nothing
but
groans
,
curse
and
blasphemy
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
hellish
crew
,
I
be
subject
to
the
tyranny
of
a
barbarian
,
who
impose
upon
me
task
that
I
could
not
possibly
perform
,
and
then
punish
my
incapacity
with
the
utmost
rigour
and
inhumanity
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
often
whipt
into
a
swoon
,
and
lash
out
of
it
,
during
which
miserable
interval
,
I
be
rob
by
my
fellow
-
prisoner
of
every
thing
about
me
,
even
to
my
cape
,
shoe
and
stocking
:
I
be
not
only
destitute
of
necessary
,
but
even
of
food
,
so
that
my
wretchedness
be
extreme
.
<EOS>
not
one
of
my
acquaintance
to
whom
I
impart
my
situation
,
would
grant
me
the
least
succour
or
regard
,
on
pretence
of
my
be
commit
for
theft
;
and
my
landlord
refuse
to
part
with
some
of
my
own
cloath
which
I
send
for
,
because
I
be
indebted
to
him
for
a
week
's
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
overwhelm
with
calamity
,
I
grow
desperate
,
and
resolve
to
put
an
end
to
my
grievance
and
life
together
;
for
this
purpose
I
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
when
I
think
every
body
round
me
asleep
,
and
fix
one
end
of
my
handkerchief
to
a
large
hook
in
the
ceiling
,
that
support
the
scale
on
which
the
hemp
be
weigh
<EOS>
,
I
stand
upon
a
chair
and
make
a
noose
on
the
other
end
,
put
my
neck
into
it
,
with
an
intention
to
hang
myself
,
but
before
I
could
adjust
the
knot
,
I
be
surprised
and
prevent
by
two
woman
who
have
be
awake
all
the
while
,
and
suspect
my
design
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
my
attempt
be
publish
among
the
prisoner
,
and
punish
with
thirty
stripe
,
the
pain
of
which
co
-
operating
with
my
disappointment
and
disgrace
,
bereft
me
of
my
sense
and
throw
me
into
an
extasy
of
madness
,
wherein
I
tear
the
flesh
from
my
bone
with
my
tooth
,
and
dash
my
head
against
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
they
be
oblige
to
set
a
watch
over
me
,
to
restrain
me
from
do
further
mischief
to
myself
and
other
.
 
<EOS>
this
fit
of
phrenzy
continue
three
day
,
at
the
end
of
which
I
grow
calm
and
sullen
;
but
as
the
desire
of
make
away
with
myself
still
remain
,
I
come
to
a
determination
of
starve
myself
to
death
,
and
with
that
view
refuse
all
sustenance
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
owe
to
the
want
of
opposition
,
or
to
the
weakness
of
nature
,
I
know
not
,
but
on
the
second
day
of
my
fast
,
I
find
my
resolution
considerably
impair
,
and
the
call
of
hunger
almost
insupportable
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
critical
conjuncture
a
lady
be
bring
into
the
prison
,
with
whom
I
have
contract
an
acquaintance
while
I
live
with
Horatio
;
she
be
then
on
the
same
footing
as
I
be
,
but
afterwards
quarrel
with
her
gallant
,
and
not
find
another
to
her
mind
,
alter
her
scheme
of
life
,
and
set
up
a
coffee
-
house
among
the
hundred
of
Drury
,
where
she
entertain
gentleman
with
claret
,
arrack
and
the
choice
of
half
a
dozen
damsel
,
who
live
in
her
house
.
<EOS>
this
serviceable
matron
,
have
neglect
to
gratify
a
certain
j####ce
for
the
connivance
she
enjoy
,
be
indict
at
the
quarter
session
,
in
consequence
of
which
her
bevy
be
disperse
and
herself
commit
to
Bridewell
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
long
there
,
before
she
learn
my
disaster
,
and
come
up
to
me
,
after
a
compliment
of
condolance
,
enquire
into
the
particular
of
my
fate
:
while
we
be
engage
in
discourse
together
,
the
master
come
up
,
tell
me
that
the
fellow
on
whose
account
I
have
suffer
be
take
,
that
he
have
confess
the
theft
,
and
clear
me
of
any
concern
in
the
affair
;
for
which
reason
he
,
the
master
,
have
order
to
discharge
me
,
and
that
I
be
from
that
moment
free
.
    
<EOS>
this
piece
of
news
soon
banish
all
thought
of
death
,
and
have
such
an
instantaneous
effect
on
my
countenance
,
that
Mrs
Coupler
(
the
lady
then
present
)
hope
to
find
her
account
in
me
,
very
generously
offer
to
furnish
me
with
what
necessary
I
want
,
and
take
me
into
her
own
house
,
as
soon
as
she
could
compromise
matter
with
the
j####ces
.
 
<EOS>
the
condition
of
her
offer
,
be
,
that
I
should
pay
three
guinea
weekly
for
my
board
,
and
a
reasonable
consideration
besides
for
the
use
of
such
cloath
and
ornament
as
she
should
supply
me
with
,
to
be
deduct
from
the
first
profit
of
my
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
hard
term
;
but
not
be
reject
by
one
who
be
turn
out
helpless
and
naked
into
the
wide
world
,
without
a
friend
to
pity
or
assist
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
embrace
her
proposal
,
and
she
be
bail
in
a
few
hour
,
take
me
home
with
her
in
a
coach
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
by
this
time
conscious
of
have
formerly
disgust
my
admirer
by
my
reserved
and
haughty
behaviour
,
I
now
endeavour
to
conquer
that
disposition
,
and
the
sudden
change
of
my
fortune
give
me
a
flow
of
spirit
<EOS>
,
I
appear
in
the
most
winning
and
gay
manner
I
could
assume
.
<EOS>
have
the
advantage
of
a
good
voice
and
education
over
most
of
my
rival
,
I
exert
my
talent
to
the
uttermost
,
and
soon
become
the
favourite
with
all
company
.
 
<EOS>
this
success
alarm
the
pride
and
jealousy
of
Mrs
Coupler
,
who
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
be
eclipse
:
She
therefore
make
a
merit
of
her
envy
,
and
whisper
about
among
her
customer
that
I
be
unsound
.
 
<EOS>
there
need
no
more
to
ruin
my
reputation
and
blast
my
prosperity
;
every
body
shun
me
with
mark
of
aversion
and
disdain
,
and
in
a
very
short
time
I
be
as
solitary
as
ever
.
<EOS>
want
of
gallant
be
attend
with
want
of
money
to
satisfy
my
malicious
landlady
,
who
have
purposely
give
me
credit
to
the
amount
of
eleven
pound
,
take
out
a
writ
against
me
,
and
I
be
arrest
in
her
own
house
.
     
<EOS>
though
the
room
be
croude
with
people
,
when
the
bailif
enter
,
not
one
of
them
have
compassion
enough
to
attempt
to
molify
my
prosecutrix
,
far
less
to
pay
the
debt
;
they
even
laugh
at
my
tear
,
and
one
of
them
bid
me
be
of
good
cheer
,
for
I
should
not
want
admirer
in
Newgate
.
<EOS>
at
that
instant
a
sea
lieutenant
come
in
,
and
see
my
plight
,
begin
to
enquire
into
the
circumstance
of
my
misfortune
,
when
this
wit
advise
him
to
keep
clear
of
me
,
for
I
be
a
fire
-
ship
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
fire
-
ship
!
<EOS>
(
reply
the
sailor
)
more
like
a
poor
galley
in
distress
that
have
be
board
by
such
a
fire
-
ship
as
you
;
if
so
be
that
be
the
case
,
she
stand
in
more
need
of
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
Harkee
,
my
girl
<EOS>
,
how
far
have
you
over
-
run
the
constable
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
the
debt
amount
to
eleven
pound
,
besides
the
expence
of
the
writ
.
 
<EOS>
"
an
that
be
all
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
shall
not
go
to
the
bilbo
this
bout
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
take
out
his
purse
,
pay
the
money
,
discharge
the
bailif
,
and
tell
me
,
I
have
get
into
the
wrong
port
,
advise
me
to
seek
out
a
more
convenient
harbour
,
where
I
could
be
safely
hove
down
,
for
which
purpose
he
make
me
a
present
of
five
guinea
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
touch
with
this
singular
piece
of
generosity
,
<EOS>
that
for
some
time
I
have
not
power
to
thank
him
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
as
soon
as
I
have
recollect
myself
,
I
beg
the
favour
of
him
to
go
with
me
to
the
next
tavern
,
where
I
explain
the
nature
of
my
disaster
,
and
convince
him
of
the
falsehood
of
what
be
report
to
my
prejudice
so
effectually
,
that
he
from
that
moment
attach
himself
to
me
,
and
we
live
in
great
harmony
together
,
until
he
be
oblige
to
go
to
sea
,
where
he
perish
in
a
storm
.
    
<EOS>
have
lose
my
benefactor
,
and
almost
consume
the
remain
of
his
bounty
,
I
see
myself
in
danger
of
relapse
into
my
former
necessity
,
and
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
at
the
prospect
of
bailifs
and
jail
;
 
when
one
of
the
sisterhood
,
a
little
stale
,
advise
me
to
take
lodging
in
a
part
of
the
town
where
I
be
unknown
,
and
pass
for
an
heiress
,
which
may
entrap
some
body
to
be
my
husband
,
who
would
possibly
be
able
to
allow
me
an
handsome
maintenance
,
or
at
bad
screen
me
from
the
dread
and
danger
of
a
prison
,
by
become
liable
for
whatever
debt
I
should
contract
.
 
<EOS>
I
approve
of
this
scheme
,
towards
the
execution
of
which
my
companion
club
her
wardrobe
,
and
undertake
to
live
with
me
in
quality
of
my
maid
;
with
the
proviso
,
that
she
should
be
reimburse
and
handsomely
consider
out
of
the
profit
of
my
success
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
immediately
detach
to
look
out
for
a
convenient
place
,
and
that
very
day
hire
a
genteel
apartment
in
Park
-
street
<EOS>
,
whither
I
move
in
a
coach
load
with
her
baggage
and
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
my
first
appearance
in
a
blue
riding
-
habit
trim
with
silver
;
and
my
maid
act
her
part
so
artfully
,
that
in
a
day
or
two
,
my
fame
be
spread
all
over
the
neighbourhood
,
and
I
be
say
to
be
a
rich
heiress
just
arrive
from
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
this
report
bring
a
swarm
of
gay
young
fellow
about
me
;
but
I
soon
find
them
out
to
be
all
indigent
adventurer
like
myself
,
who
croude
to
me
like
crow
to
a
carrion
,
with
a
view
of
prey
upon
my
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
maintain
,
however
,
the
appearance
of
wealth
as
long
as
possible
,
in
hope
of
gain
some
admirer
more
for
my
purpose
;
and
<EOS>
at
length
,
I
attract
the
regard
of
one
who
would
have
satisfy
my
wish
,
and
manage
matter
so
well
,
that
a
day
be
actually
fix
for
our
nuptial
:
    
<EOS>
in
the
interim
,
he
beg
leave
to
introduce
an
intimate
friend
to
me
,
which
request
as
I
could
not
refuse
,
I
have
the
extreme
mortification
and
surprize
,
to
see
next
night
,
in
that
friend
,
my
old
keeper
Horatio
,
who
no
sooner
beheld
me
than
he
change
colour
;
but
have
presence
of
mind
enough
to
advance
and
salute
me
,
bid
me
(
with
a
low
voice
)
be
under
no
apprehension
,
for
he
would
not
expose
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
this
assurance
,
I
could
not
recover
myself
so
far
,
as
to
entertain
them
,
but
withdraw
to
my
chamber
on
pretence
of
a
severe
head
-
ach
,
to
the
no
small
concern
of
my
adorer
,
who
take
his
leave
in
the
tender
manner
,
and
go
off
with
his
friend
.
    
<EOS>
have
impart
my
situation
to
my
companion
,
she
find
it
high
time
for
us
to
decamp
,
and
that
without
any
noise
,
because
we
be
not
only
indebted
to
our
landlady
,
but
also
to
several
tradesman
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Our
retreat
(
therefore
)
be
concert
and
execute
in
this
manner
:
have
pack
up
all
our
cloath
and
moveable
in
small
parcel
,
she
(
on
pretence
of
fetching
cordial
for
me
)
carry
them
at
several
time
,
to
the
house
of
an
acquaintance
,
where
she
likewise
procure
a
lodging
,
to
which
we
retire
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
open
the
street
door
,
when
every
other
body
in
the
house
be
asleep
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
now
oblige
to
aim
at
low
game
,
and
accordingly
spread
my
net
among
trade
people
;
but
find
them
all
too
phlegmatic
or
cautious
for
my
art
and
attraction
;
till
at
last
I
become
acquainted
with
you
,
on
whom
I
practise
all
my
dexterity
;
not
that
I
believe
you
have
any
fortune
or
expectation
of
one
,
but
that
I
may
transfer
the
burthen
of
such
debt
as
I
have
incur
or
could
contract
,
from
myself
to
another
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
avenge
myself
of
your
sex
,
by
render
miserable
,
one
who
bear
such
resemblance
to
the
wretch
who
ruin
me
;
 
but
heaven
preserve
you
from
my
snare
,
by
the
discovery
you
make
,
which
be
owe
to
the
negligence
of
my
maid
in
leave
the
chamber
-
door
unlock
,
when
she
go
to
buy
sugar
for
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
the
person
in
bed
with
me
,
be
a
gentleman
whom
I
have
allure
the
night
before
,
as
he
walk
homeward
pretty
much
elevated
with
liquor
;
for
by
this
time
,
my
condition
be
so
low
,
that
I
be
force
to
turn
out
,
in
the
twilight
,
to
the
street
in
hope
of
prey
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
find
myself
detect
and
forsake
by
you
,
I
be
fain
to
move
my
lodging
and
dwell
two
pair
of
stair
high
than
before
:
My
companion
be
disappoint
in
her
expectation
,
leave
me
,
to
trade
upon
her
own
bottom
,
and
I
have
no
other
resource
,
than
to
venture
forth
like
the
owl
,
in
the
dark
,
to
pick
up
a
precarious
and
uncomfortable
subsistence
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
saunter
between
Ludgate
-
hill
and
Charing
-
cross
,
a
whole
winter
-
night
,
expose
not
only
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
,
but
likewise
to
the
rage
of
hunger
and
thirst
,
without
be
so
happy
as
to
meet
with
one
cully
;
then
creep
up
to
my
garret
in
a
deplorable
,
draggle
condition
,
sneak
to
bed
,
and
try
to
bury
my
appetite
and
sorrow
in
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
light
on
some
rake
or
tradesman
reel
home
drunk
,
I
frequently
suffer
the
most
brutal
treatment
,
in
spite
of
which
I
be
oblige
to
affect
gaiety
and
good
humour
,
tho
'
<EOS>
my
soul
be
sting
with
resentment
and
disdain
,
and
my
heart
load
with
grief
and
affliction
.
     
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
these
nocturnal
adventure
,
I
be
infect
with
the
disease
,
that
in
a
short
time
render'd
<EOS>
me
the
object
of
my
own
abhorrence
,
and
drive
me
to
the
retreat
,
where
your
benevolence
rescue
me
from
the
jaw
of
death
.
    
<EOS>
so
much
candour
and
good
sense
appear
in
this
lady
's
narration
,
that
I
make
no
scruple
of
believe
every
syllable
of
what
she
say
;
and
express
my
astonishment
at
the
variety
of
misery
she
have
undergo
,
in
so
little
time
;
for
all
her
misfortune
have
happen
within
the
compass
of
two
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
compare
her
situation
with
my
own
,
and
find
it
a
thousand
time
more
wretched
<EOS>
:
I
have
endure
hardship
,
'
tis
true
;
my
whole
life
have
be
a
series
of
such
,
and
when
I
look
forward
,
the
prospect
be
not
much
better
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
they
be
become
habitual
to
me
,
and
consequently
,
I
could
bear
them
with
less
difficulty
 
<EOS>
if
one
scheme
of
life
should
not
succeed
,
I
could
have
recourse
to
another
,
and
so
to
a
third
,
veer
about
to
a
thousand
different
shift
,
accord
to
the
emergency
of
my
fate
,
without
forfeit
the
dignity
of
my
character
,
beyond
a
power
of
retrieve
it
,
or
subject
myself
wholly
to
the
caprice
and
barbarity
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
she
have
know
and
relish
the
sweet
of
prosperity
,
she
have
be
bring
up
under
the
wing
of
an
indulgent
parent
,
in
all
the
delicacy
to
which
her
sex
and
rank
entitle
her
;
and
without
any
extravagance
of
hope
,
entertain
herself
with
the
view
of
uninterrupted
happiness
thro
'
the
whole
scene
of
life
 
<EOS>
how
fatal
then
,
how
torment
,
how
intolerable
must
her
reverse
of
fortune
be
!
<EOS>
a
reverse
,
that
not
only
robb
her
of
these
external
comfort
,
and
plunge
her
into
all
the
misery
of
want
,
but
also
murther
her
peace
of
mind
,
and
entail
upon
her
the
curse
of
eternal
infamy
!
     
<EOS>
of
all
profession
I
pronounce
that
of
a
courtezan
the
most
deplorable
,
and
her
of
all
courtezan
the
most
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
She
allow
my
observation
to
be
just
in
the
main
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
affirm
,
that
notwithstanding
the
disgrace
which
have
fall
to
her
share
,
she
have
not
be
so
unlucky
in
the
condition
of
a
prostitute
as
many
other
of
the
same
community
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
see
(
say
she
)
while
I
stroll
about
the
street
at
mid
-
night
,
a
number
of
naked
wretch
reduce
to
rag
and
filth
,
huddle
together
like
swine
,
in
the
corner
of
a
dark
alley
;
some
of
whom
,
but
eighteen
month
before
,
I
have
know
the
favourite
of
the
town
,
roll
in
affluence
,
and
glitter
in
all
the
pomp
of
equipage
and
dress
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
the
gradation
be
easily
conceive
;
the
most
fashionable
woman
of
the
town
be
as
liable
to
contagion
,
as
one
in
a
much
humble
sphere
;
she
infect
her
admirer
,
her
situation
be
publick
,
she
be
avoid

neglect
,
unable
to
support
her
usual
appearance

which
however
she
strive
to
maintain
as
long
as
possible

her
credit
fail

she
be
oblige
to
retrench
and
become
a
night

walker
,
her
malady
gain
ground

she
tamper
with
her
constitution

it

her
complexion
fade

she

she

miserable
condition

'
till
she
be
discharge
because
the
plaintiff
appear
not
to

her
.
    
<EOS>
no
body
will
afford
her
lodging
,
the
symptom
of
her
distemper
be
grow
outrageous
,
she
sue
to
be
admit
into
an

upon
the
address
of
the
canaille

be
fain
to
allay
the
rage
of
hunger
and
cold
with
gin
,
degenerate
into
a
state
of
brutal
insensibility

rot
and

upon

miserable
wretch
that
I
be

perhaps
the

horror
be
decree
for
me
!

no

she
after

pause

never

my

forlorn
period

<EOS>
Her
condition
fill
me
with
sympathy
and
compassion
;
I
revere
her
qualification
,
look
upon
her
as
unfortunate
,
not
criminal
;
and
attend
her
with
such
care
and
success
,
that
in
less
than
two
month
,
her
health
,
as
well
as
my
own
,
be
perfectly
re

establish
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
often
confer
upon
our
mutual
affair
,
and
interchanged
advice
;
a
thousand
different
project
be
form
,
which
upon
further
canvass
appear
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
have
gladly
go
to
service
;
but
who
would
take
us
in
without
recommendation
?
<EOS>
at
length
an
expedient
occur
to
her
,
of
which
she
intend
to
lay
hold
;
and
this
be
,
to
procure
with
the
first
money
she
should
earn
,
the
homely
garb
of
a
country
wench
,
go
to
some
village
at
a
good
distance
from
town
,
and
come
up
in
a
waggon
,
as
a
fresh
girl
for
service
;
by
which
mean
,
she
may
be
provide
for
in
a
manner
much
more
suitable
to
her
inclination

than
her
present
way
of

<EOS>
my
arrival
on
board
of
the
Thunder
man
of
war
,
where
I
be
put
in
iron
,
and
afterwards
release
by
the
good

of
Mr

who
recommend
me
as

he
relate
his

make
me
acquaint
with
the
character
of
the

surgeon

and
first

<EOS>
I
applaud
the
resolution
of
Miss
Williams
,
who
a
few
day
after
,
be
hire
in
quality
of
bar
-
keeper
,
by
one
of
the
lady
who
have
witness
in
her
behalf
at
the
Marshalsea

and
who
since
that
time
have
get
credit
with
a
wine
merchant
,
whose
favourite
she
be

to
set
up
a
convenient

of

<EOS>
Thither
my
fellow
lodger
repair
,
after
have
take
leave
of
me
,
with
a
torrent
of
tear
,
and
a
thousand
protestation
of
eternal
gratitude
;
assure
me
,
she
would
remain
in
this
new
situation
no
longer
than
till
she
should
pick
up
money
sufficient
to
put
her
other
design
in
execution
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
I
see
no
resource
but
the
army
or
navy
,
between
which
I
hesitate
so
long
,
that
I
find
myself
reduce
to
a
starve
condition
.
     
<EOS>
My
spirit
begin
to
accommodate
itself
to
my
beggarly
fate
,
and
I
become
so
mean
,
as
to
go
down
towards
wapping
,
with
an
intention
to
enquire
for
an
old
school
-
fellow
of
mine
,
who
(
I
understand
)
have
get
the
command
of
a
small
coast
vessel
,
then
in
the
river
,
and
implore
his
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
destiny
prevent
this
abject
piece
of
behaviour
;
for
as
I
cross
Tower
-
wharf
,
a
squat
tawny
fellow
,
with
a
hanger
by
his
side
,
and
a
cudgel
in
his
hand
,
come
up
to
me
,
call
,
"
Yo
,
ho
!
<EOS>
brother
,
you
must
come
along
with
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
like
his
appearance
,
instead
of
answer
his
salutation
,
I
quicken
my
pace
in
hope
of
rid
myself
of
his
company
;
which
he
perceive
,
whistle
aloud
,
and
immediately
another
sailor
appear
before
me
,
who
lay
hold
of
me
by
the
collar
and
begin
to
drag
me
along
.
 
<EOS>
not
be
of
a
humour
to
relish
such
treatment
,
I
disengage
myself
of
the
assailant
,
and
with
one
blow
of
my
cudgel
,
lay
him
motionless
on
the
ground
:
and
perceive
myself
surround
in
a
trice
,
by
ten
or
a
dozen
more
,
exert
myself
with
such
dexterity
and
success
,
that
some
of
my
opponent
be
fain
to
attack
me
with
draw
cutlass
;
and
after
an
obstinate
engagement
,
in
which
I
receive
a
large
wound
on
the
head
,
and
another
on
my
left
cheek
,
I
be
disarm
,
take
prisoner
,
and
carry
on
board
a
press
tender
;
where
,
after
be
pinion
like
a
malefactor
,
I
be
thrust
down
into
the
hold
,
among
a
parcel
of
miserable
wretch
,
the
sight
of
whom
well
nigh
distract
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
command
officer
have
not
humanity
enough
to
order
my
wound
to
be
dress
,
and
I
could
not
use
my
own
hand
,
I
desire
one
of
my
fellow
-
captive
who
be
unfettered
,
to
take
a
handkerchief
out
of
my
pocket
and
tie
it
round
my
head
to
stop
the
bleeding
.
    
<EOS>
He
pull
out
my
handkerchief
(
'
tis
true
)
but
instead
of
apply
it
to
the
use
for
which
I
design
it
,
go
to
the
grating
of
the
hatchway
,
and
with
astonishing
composure
,
sell
it
before
my
face
to
a
bum
-
boat
-
woman
then
on
board
,
for
a
quart
of
gin
,
with
which
he
treat
his
companion
,
regardless
of
my
circumstance
and
intreatie
.
    
<EOS>
I
complain
bitterly
of
this
robbery
,
to
the
midshipman
on
deck
,
tell
him
at
the
same
time
,
that
unless
my
hurt
be
dress
,
I
should
bleed
to
death
.
<EOS>
but
compassion
be
a
weakness
of
which
no
man
could
justly
accuse
this
person
,
who
squirt
a
mouthful
of
dissolve
tobacco
upon
me
,
through
the
grating
,
tell
me
,
"
I
be
a
mutinous
dog
,
and
that
I
may
die
and
be
damn
.
"
 
<EOS>
Finding
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
remedy
,
I
appeal
to
patience
,
and
lay
up
this
usage
in
my
memory
,
to
be
recall
at
a
fitter
season
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
loss
of
blood
,
vexation
and
want
of
food
,
contribute
,
with
the
noisome
stench
of
the
place
,
to
throw
me
into
a
swoon
;
out
of
which
I
be
recover
by
a
tweak
of
the
nose
,
administre
by
the
tar
who
stand
centinel
over
us
,
who
at
the
same
time
regale
me
with
a
draught
of
flip
,
and
comfort
me
with
the
hope
of
be
put
on
board
of
the
Thunder
next
day
,
where
I
would
be
free
from
handcuff
,
and
cure
of
my
wound
by
the
doctor
.
     
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
hear
him
name
the
Thunder
,
than
I
ask
,
if
he
have
belong
to
that
ship
long
;
and
he
give
me
to
understand
,
he
have
belong
to
her
five
year
,
I
enquire
if
he
know
lieutenant
Bowling
?
 
<EOS>
"
know
lieutenant
Bowling
(
say
he
)
 
odd
my
life
!
<EOS>
and
that
I
do
;
 
and
a
good
seaman
he
be
,
as
ever
stept
upon
forecastle
,
 
and
a
brave
fellow
as
ever
crackt
bisket
;
 
none
of
your
Guinea
pig
,
 
nor
your
fresh
-
water
,
wishy
washy
,
fair
-
weather
fowl
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
taught
gale
of
wind
have
honest
Tom
Bowling
and
I
weather
together
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
his
health
with
all
my
heart
,
where
-
ever
he
be
,
a
-
loft
or
a
-
low
 
in
heaven
or
in
hell
 
<EOS>
all
be
one
for
that
 
he
need
not
be
ashamed
to
shew
himself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
affected
with
this
elogium
,
that
I
could
not
refrain
from
tell
him
,
I
be
lieutenant
Bowling
's
kinsman
;
at
which
he
express
an
inclination
to
serve
me
,
and
when
he
be
relieve
bring
some
cold
boil
beef
in
a
platter
and
biscuit
,
on
which
we
sup
plentifully
,
and
afterwards
drank
another
can
of
flip
together
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
thus
engage
,
he
recount
a
great
many
exploit
of
my
uncle
,
who
(
I
find
)
be
very
much
beloved
by
the
ship
's
company
,
and
pity
for
the
misfortune
that
happen
to
him
in
Hispaniola
,
which
I
be
very
glad
to
be
inform
<EOS>
be
not
so
great
as
I
imagine
;
for
captain
Oakhum
have
recover
of
his
wound
,
and
actually
at
that
time
,
command
the
ship
.
<EOS>
have
by
accident
,
in
my
pocket
my
uncle
's
letter
write
from
Port
Louis
,
I
give
it
my
benefactor
(
whose
name
be
Jack
Rattlin
)
<EOS>
for
his
perusal
;
but
honest
Jack
tell
me
frankly
,
he
could
not
read
,
and
desire
to
know
the
content
,
which
I
immediately
communicate
:
    
when
he
hear
that
part
of
it
,
in
which
,
he
say
,
he
have
write
to
his
landlord
in
Deal
;
he
cry
,
"
body
o
'
me
!
<EOS>
that
be
old
Ben
Block
,
 
he
be
dead
before
the
letter
come
to
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Ey
,
ey
,
have
Ben
be
alive
,
lieutenant
Bowling
would
have
have
no
occasion
to
sculk
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
Honest
Ben
be
the
first
man
that
teach
him
to
hand
,
reef
and
steer
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
we
must
all
die
<EOS>
,
that
be
certain
,
 
we
must
all
come
to
port
sooner
or
later
,
 
at
sea
or
on
shore
;
we
must
be
fast
moor
one
day
,
 
death
's
like
the
good
bower
anchor
,
as
the
saying
be
,
it
will
bring
us
all
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
signify
my
approbation
of
the
justness
of
Jack
's
reflection
;
and
enquire
into
the
occasion
of
the
quarrel
between
captain
Oakhum
and
my
uncle
,
which
he
explain
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Captain
Oakhum
,
to
be
sure
,
be
a
good
man
enough
,
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
be
my
commander
;
 
but
what
be
that
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
my
duty
,
and
value
no
man
's
anger
of
a
rope
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
report
go
,
as
how
he
be
a
lord
's
,
or
baron
knight
's
brother
,
whereby
(
d'ye
see
me
)
<EOS>
he
carry
a
strait
arm
,
and
keep
a
loof
from
his
officer
,
thof
,
may
hap
,
they
may
be
as
good
man
in
the
main
as
he
.
    
<EOS>
now
we
lie
at
anchor
in
Tuberoon
bay
,
lieutenant
Bowling
have
the
middle
watch
,
and
as
he
always
keep
a
good
-
look
out
,
he
make
(
d'ye
see
)
<EOS>
three
light
in
the
offing
,
whereby
he
run
down
to
the
great
cabbin
for
order
,
and
find
the
captain
asleep
;
 
<EOS>
whereupon
he
wake
him
,
which
put
him
in
a
main
high
passion
,
and
he
swear
woundily
at
the
lieutenant
,
and
call
him
lousy
Scotch
son
of
a
whore
,
(
for
I
be
then
centinel
in
the
steerage
,
hear
all
)
and
swab
and
swabbard
,
whereby
the
lieutenant
return
the
salute
,
and
they
jaw
together
fore
and
aft
a
good
spell
,
till
at
last
the
captain
turn
out
,
and
lay
hold
of
a
rattan
,
come
athwart
<EOS>
Mr
Bowling
's
quarter
;
whereby
he
tell
the
captain
,
that
if
he
be
not
his
commander
,
he
would
heave
him
over
-
board
,
and
demand
satisfaction
a
-
shore
,
whereby
in
the
morning
watch
,
the
captain
go
ashore
in
the
pinnace
,
and
afterwards
the
lieutenant
carry
the
cutter
a
-
shore
;
and
so
they
,
leave
the
boat
crew
on
their
oar
,
go
away
together
;
and
so
(
d'ye
see
)
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
hear
fire
,
whereby
we
make
for
the
place
,
and
find
the
captain
lie
wound
on
the
beach
,
and
so
bring
him
on
board
to
the
doctor
,
who
cure
him
in
less
than
six
week
.
<EOS>
but
the
lieutenant
clapt
on
all
the
sail
he
could
bear
,
and
have
get
far
enough
a
-
head
before
we
know
any
thing
of
the
matter
;
so
that
we
could
never
after
get
sight
of
him
,
for
which
we
be
not
sorry
,
because
the
captain
be
mainly
wroth
,
and
would
certainly
have
do
him
a
mischief
;
 
for
he
afterwards
cause
him
to
be
run
on
the
ship
book
,
whereby
he
lose
all
his
pay
,
and
if
he
should
be
take
,
would
be
try
as
a
deserter
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
account
of
the
captain
's
behaviour
give
me
no
advantageous
idea
of
his
character
;
and
I
could
not
help
lament
my
own
fate
,
that
have
subject
me
to
such
a
commander
.
<EOS>
however
,
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
I
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
,
and
next
day
be
with
the
other
press
man
put
on
board
of
the
Thunder
lie
at
the
Nore
.
     
<EOS>
when
we
come
along
-
side
,
the
mate
who
guard
us
thither
,
order
my
hand
-
cuff
to
be
take
off
,
that
I
may
get
on
board
the
easy
;
which
be
perceive
by
some
of
the
company
who
stand
upon
the
gangboard
to
see
us
enter
,
one
of
them
call
to
Jack
Rattlin
,
who
be
busy
in
do
this
friendly
office
for
me
;
"
hey
,
Jack
,
what
Newgate
galley
have
you
board
in
the
river
as
you
come
along
?
<EOS>
have
we
not
thief
enow
among
us
already
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
another
observe
my
wound
,
which
still
remain
expose
to
the
air
,
tell
me
,
my
seam
be
uncaulke
,
and
that
I
must
be
new
pay
.
 
<EOS>
a
third
,
see
my
hair
clot
together
with
blood
,
as
it
be
,
into
distinct
cord
,
take
notice
,
that
my
bow
be
man
with
the
red
rope
,
instead
of
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
a
fourth
ask
me
,
if
I
could
not
keep
my
yard
square
without
iron
brace
?
<EOS>
and
in
short
,
a
thousand
witticism
of
the
same
nature
,
be
pass
upon
me
,
before
I
could
get
up
the
ship
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
after
we
have
be
all
enter
upon
the
book
,
I
enquire
at
one
of
my
ship
-
mate
where
the
surgeon
be
,
that
I
may
have
my
wound
dress
,
and
have
actually
get
as
far
as
the
middle
deck
(
for
our
ship
carry
eighty
gun
)
in
my
way
to
the
cock
-
pit
,
when
I
be
meet
by
the
same
midshipman
who
have
use
me
so
barbarously
in
the
tender
:
<EOS>
He
see
me
free
from
my
chain
,
ask
,
with
an
insolent
air
,
who
have
release
me
?
<EOS>
to
this
I
foolishly
answer
,
with
a
countenance
that
too
plainly
declare
the
state
of
my
thought
;
"
whoever
do
it
,
I
be
persuade
do
not
consult
you
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
utter
these
word
,
than
he
cry
,
"
D####n
you
,
you
saucy
son
of
a
b####ch
,
I
will
teach
you
to
talk
so
to
your
officer
.
"
     
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
bestow
on
me
several
severe
stripe
,
with
a
supple
Jack
he
have
in
his
hand
;
and
go
to
the
command
officer
,
make
such
a
report
of
me
,
that
I
be
immediately
put
in
iron
by
the
master
at
arm
,
and
a
centinel
place
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
Honest
Rattlin
,
as
soon
as
he
hear
of
my
condition
,
come
to
me
,
and
administre
all
the
consolation
he
could
,
and
then
go
to
the
surgeon
in
my
behalf
,
who
send
one
of
his
mate
to
dress
my
wound
.
<EOS>
this
mate
be
no
other
than
my
old
friend
Thomson
,
with
whom
I
become
acquaint
at
the
Navy
-
office
,
as
before
mention
.
<EOS>
if
I
know
him
at
first
sight
,
it
be
not
so
easy
for
him
to
recognize
me
,
disfigure
with
blood
and
dirt
,
and
alter
by
the
misery
I
have
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
unknown
as
I
be
to
him
,
he
survey
me
with
look
of
compassion
,
and
handle
my
sore
with
great
tenderness
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
apply
what
he
think
proper
,
and
be
about
to
leave
me
,
I
ask
him
if
my
misfortune
have
disquise
me
so
much
,
that
he
could
not
recollect
my
face
?
<EOS>
upon
this
he
observe
me
with
great
earnestness
for
some
time
,
and
at
length
,
protest
he
could
not
recollect
one
feature
of
my
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
to
keep
him
no
longer
in
suspence
,
I
tell
him
my
name
;
which
when
he
hear
,
he
embrace
me
with
affection
,
and
profess
his
sorrow
in
see
me
in
such
a
disagreeable
situation
.
<EOS>
I
make
him
acquaint
with
my
story
,
and
when
he
hear
how
inhumanly
I
have
be
use
in
the
tender
,
he
leave
me
abruptly
,
assure
me
<EOS>
,
I
should
see
him
again
soon
.
<EOS>
I
have
scarce
time
to
wonder
at
his
sudden
departure
,
when
the
master
at
arm
come
to
the
place
of
my
confinement
,
and
bid
me
follow
him
to
the
quarter
-
deck
,
where
I
be
examine
by
the
first
lieutenant
,
who
command
the
ship
in
the
absence
of
the
captain
,
touch
the
treatment
I
have
receive
in
the
tender
from
my
friend
the
midshipman
,
who
be
present
to
confront
me
.
     
<EOS>
I
recount
the
particular
of
his
behaviour
to
me
,
not
only
in
the
tender
,
but
since
my
being
on
board
the
ship
,
part
of
which
be
prove
by
the
evidence
of
Jack
Rattlin
and
other
,
who
have
no
great
devotion
for
my
oppressor
,
I
be
discharge
from
confinement
to
make
way
for
him
,
who
be
deliver
to
the
master
at
arm
to
take
his
turn
in
the
Bilboes
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
not
the
only
satisfaction
I
enjoy
,
for
I
be
,
at
the
request
of
the
surgeon
,
<EOS>
exempt
from
all
other
duty
,
than
that
of
assist
his
mate
in
make
and
administre
medicine
to
the
sick
.
 
<EOS>
this
good
office
I
owe
to
the
friendship
of
Mr
Thomson
,
who
have
represent
me
in
such
a
favourable
light
to
the
surgeon
,
that
he
demand
me
of
the
lieutenant
,
to
supply
the
place
of
his
third
mate
,
who
be
lately
dead
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
obtain
this
favour
,
my
friend
Thomson
carry
me
down
to
the
cockpit
,
which
be
the
place
allot
for
the
habitation
of
the
surgeon
's
mate
:
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
shew
me
their
birth
(
as
he
call
it
)
<EOS>
I
be
fill
with
astonishment
and
horror
.
 
<EOS>
We
descend
by
diver
ladder
to
a
space
as
dark
as
a
dungeon
,
which
I
understand
be
immerse
several
foot
under
water
,
be
immediately
above
the
hold
:
I
have
no
sooner
approach
this
dismal
gulph
,
than
my
nose
be
salute
with
an
intolerable
stench
of
putrified
cheese
,
and
rancid
butter
,
that
issue
from
an
apartment
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
,
resemble
a
chandler
's
shop
,
where
,
by
the
faint
glimmering
of
a
candle
,
I
could
perceive
a
man
with
a
pale
meagre
countenance
,
sit
behind
a
kind
of
desk
,
have
spectacle
on
his
nose
,
and
a
pen
in
his
hand
.
     
<EOS>
this
(
I
learn
of
Mr
Thomson
)
be
the
ship
's
steward
,
who
sit
there
to
distribute
provision
to
the
several
mess
,
and
to
mark
what
each
receive
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
present
my
name
to
him
,
and
desire
I
may
be
enter
in
his
mess
;
then
take
a
light
in
his
hand
,
conduct
me
to
the
place
of
his
residence
,
which
be
a
square
of
about
six
foot
,
surround
with
the
medicine
chest
,
that
of
the
first
mate
,
his
own
,
and
a
board
by
way
of
table
fasten
to
the
mizen
-
mast
;
it
be
also
enclose
with
canvas
nail
round
to
the
beam
of
the
ship
,
to
screen
us
from
the
cold
,
as
well
as
the
view
of
the
midshipman
and
quarter
-
master
,
who
lodge
within
the
cable
tier
on
each
side
of
us
:
<EOS>
in
this
gloomy
mansion
,
he
entertain
me
with
some
cold
salt
pork
,
which
he
bring
from
a
sort
of
locker
,
fix
above
the
table
;
and
call
for
the
boy
of
the
mess
,
send
him
for
a
can
of
beer
,
of
which
he
make
excellent
flip
to
crown
the
banquet
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
begin
to
recover
my
spirit
,
which
have
be
exceedingly
depressed
with
the
appearance
of
every
thing
about
me
,
and
could
no
longer
refrain
from
ask
the
particular
of
Mr
Thomson
's
fortune
,
since
I
have
see
him
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
be
disappoint
in
his
expectation
of
borrow
money
to
gratify
the
rapacious
s####t####ry
at
the
Navy
-
office
,
he
find
himself
utterly
unable
to
subsist
any
longer
in
town
,
and
have
actually
offer
his
service
,
in
quality
of
mate
,
to
the
surgeon
of
a
merchant
's
ship
bind
to
Guinea
on
the
slave
trade
;
when
one
morning
,
a
young
fellow
,
of
whom
he
have
some
acquaintance
,
come
to
his
lodging
,
and
inform
him
,
that
he
have
see
a
warrant
make
out
in
his
name
at
the
Navy
-
office
,
for
surgeon
's
second
mate
of
a
third
rate
:
    
this
unexpected
piece
of
good
news
he
could
scarcely
believe
to
be
true
;
more
especially
,
as
he
have
be
find
qualified
at
Surgeon's
-
hall
for
third
mate
only
;
but
that
he
may
not
be
want
to
himself
,
he
go
thither
to
be
assure
,
and
actually
find
it
so
:
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
demand
his
warrant
,
it
be
deliver
to
him
,
and
the
oath
administre
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
that
very
afternoon
,
he
go
to
gravesend
in
the
tilt
-
boat
,
from
whence
he
take
a
place
in
the
tide
-
coach
for
Rochester
;
next
morning
get
on
board
the
Thunder
,
for
which
he
be
appoint
,
then
lie
in
the
harbour
at
Chatham
;
and
the
same
day
be
muster
by
the
clerk
of
the
checque
.
 
<EOS>
and
well
it
be
for
him
,
that
such
expedition
be
use
;
for
in
less
then
twelve
hour
after
his
arrival
,
another
William
Thomson
come
on
board
,
affirm
that
he
be
the
person
for
whom
the
warrant
be
expedite
,
and
that
the
other
be
an
impostor
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
be
grievously
alarm
at
this
accident
;
the
more
so
,
as
his
namesake
have
very
much
the
advantage
over
him
,
both
in
assurance
and
dress
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
to
acquit
himself
of
the
suspicion
of
imposture
,
he
produce
several
letter
write
from
Scotland
to
him
in
that
name
,
and
recollect
that
his
indenture
be
in
his
box
on
board
,
he
bring
them
up
,
and
convince
all
present
,
that
he
have
not
assume
a
name
which
do
not
belong
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
competitor
enrage
,
that
they
should
hesitate
in
do
him
justice
(
for
to
be
sure
,
the
warrant
have
be
design
for
him
)
behave
with
so
much
indecent
heat
,
that
the
command
officer
,
(
who
be
the
same
gentleman
I
have
see
)
and
the
surgeon
,
be
offend
at
his
presumption
,
and
make
a
point
of
it
with
their
friend
in
town
,
in
less
than
a
week
<EOS>
get
the
first
confirm
in
his
station
.
     
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
on
board
(
say
he
)
ever
since
,
and
as
this
way
of
life
be
become
familiar
to
me
,
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
my
situation
.
 
<EOS>
the
surgeon
be
a
good
-
natured
indolent
man
;
the
first
mate
(
who
be
now
on
shore
on
duty
)
be
indeed
a
little
proud
and
cholerick
,
as
all
Welchmen
be
,
but
in
the
main
,
a
friendly
honest
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
I
have
no
concern
with
;
and
as
for
the
captain
,
he
be
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
know
a
surgeon
's
mate
,
even
by
sight
.

be
as
yellow

to
this

answer
,
"
so
it
seem
my
poor

must
part
his
cable
for

assistance

His

besides
,
the

order
you
to
overhaul

you
do
not
mind

to

tell
him
my

my

be

good
as

(
no

do

<EOS>
go
your
way
,
you
rapscallion

tell
doctor
Atkins
,
that
I
desire
and
request
,
that
he
will
give
a
look
upon
the
tie
man
,
and
order
something
for
him

he
be
dead

alive

and
I
will
see
him
take
it
by
and
by
,
when

craving

be
satisfied
,
look

"
 
<EOS>
at
this
the
other
go
away
,
say
,
that
if
they
would
serve
him
so
,
when
he
be
a
dying
,
by
g
-
d
,
he
would
be
foul
of
them
in
the
other
world
.
 
<EOS>
here
Mr
Thomson
let
me
know
that
the
person
we
hear
,
be
Mr
Morgan
the
first
mate
,
who
be
just
come
on
board
from
the
hospital
,
where
he
have
be
with
sick
people
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
I
see
him
come
into
the
birth
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
short
thick
man
,
with
a
face
garnish
with
pimple
,
a
snub
nose
turn
up
at
the
end
,
an
excessive
wide
mouth
,
and
little
fiery
eye
,
surround
with
skin
pucker
up
in
innumerable
wrinkle
.
     
<EOS>
My
friend
immediately
make
him
acquaint
with
my
case
;
when
he
regard
me
with
a
very
lofty
look
,
but
without
speak
,
set
down
a
bundle
he
have
in
his
hand
,
and
approach
the
cupboard
,
which
when
he
have
open
,
he
exclaim
in
a
great
passion
,
"
Cot
be
my
life
!
<EOS>
all
the
pork
be
go
,
as
I
be
a
christian
!
"
<EOS>
Thomson
then
give
him
to
understand
,
that
as
I
have
be
bring
on
board
half
famished
,
he
could
do
no
less
than
entertain
me
with
what
be
in
the
locker
;
and
the
rather
,
as
he
have
bid
the
steward
enter
me
in
the
mess
.
 
<EOS>
whether
this
disappointment
make
Mr
Morgan
more
peevish
than
usual
,
or
he
really
think
himself
too
little
regard
by
his
fellow
-
mate
,
I
know
not
,
but
after
some
pause
,
he
go
on
in
this
manner
 
"
<EOS>
Mr
Thomson
,
perhaps
you
do
not
use
me
with
all
the
good
manner
,
and
complaisance
,
and
respect
(
look
you
)
that
become
you
,
because
you
have
not
vouchsafe
to
advise
with
me
in
this
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
in
my
time
(
look
you
)
be
a
man
of
some
weight
,
and
substance
,
and
consideration
,
and
have
keep
house
and
home
,
and
pay
scot
and
lot
,
and
the
king
's
taxis
;
ay
,
and
maintain
a
family
to
boot
.
 
<EOS>
and
moreover
,
also
,
I
be
your
senior
,
and
your
elder
,
and
your
petter
,
Mr
Thomson
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
elder
I
will
allow
you
to
be
,
but
not
my
well
(
cry
Thomson
,
with
some
heat
.
)
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Cot
be
my
saviour
,
and
witness
too
(
say
Morgan
,
with
great
vehemence
)
that
I
be
more
elder
,
and
therefore
more
petter
by
many
year
than
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
fear
<EOS>
this
dispute
may
be
attend
with
some
bad
consequence
,
I
interpose
,
and
tell
Mr
Morgan
,
I
be
very
sorry
for
have
be
the
occasion
of
any
difference
between
him
and
the
second
mate
;
and
that
rather
than
cause
the
least
breach
in
their
good
understanding
,
I
would
eat
my
allowance
by
myself
,
or
seek
admission
into
some
other
company
.
     
<EOS>
but
Thomson
,
with
more
spirit
than
discretion
(
as
I
think
)
insist
upon
my
remain
where
he
have
appoint
me
;
and
observe
that
no
man
possess
of
generosity
and
compassion
,
would
have
any
objection
to
it
,
consider
my
birth
and
talent
,
and
the
misfortune
I
have
of
late
so
unjustly
undergone
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
touch
Mr
Morgan
on
the
right
key
,
who
protest
with
great
earnestness
,
that
he
have
no
objection
to
my
be
receive
in
the
mess
;
but
only
complain
,
that
the
ceremony
of
ask
his
consent
be
not
observe
.
"
<EOS>
as
for
a
shentleman
in
distress
(
say
he
,
shake
me
by
the
hand
)
<EOS>
I
lose
him
as
I
lose
my
own
powel
:
for
Got
help
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
have
vexation
enough
upon
my
own
pack
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
afterwards
learn
,
in
so
say
he
speak
no
more
than
what
be
true
;
for
he
have
be
once
settle
in
a
very
good
situation
in
Glamorganshire
,
and
be
ruin
by
be
security
for
an
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
all
difference
be
compose
,
he
untie
his
bundle
,
which
consist
of
three
bunche
of
onion
,
and
a
great
lump
of
Cheshire
-
cheese
wrapt
up
in
a
handkerchief
;
and
take
some
biscuit
from
the
cupboard
,
fall
to
with
a
keen
appetite
,
invite
us
to
a
share
of
the
repast
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
feed
heartily
on
this
homely
fare
,
he
fill
a
large
cup
make

"
 
<EOS>
the
poor

with
great

run
to
the
place
where
the
sick
man
lie
,
but
in
less
than
a

return
with
a

and
tell

<EOS>
Morgan

<EOS>
"
stop

<EOS>
I

he
be

the

"

"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
push
the
seaman
out
of
the
birth
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
entertain
us
with
reflection
suitable
to
this
event
,
we
hear
the

pipe
to
dinner
;
and
immediately
the

belong
to
our

,
run
to
the

,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
carry
off
a
large

and
in
a
few
minute
,
return
with
it
full
of
boil

,

,
"

"
all
the

<EOS>
the

consist
of
a
piece
of
an
old

,
be
instantly
lay
,
cover
with
three
plate
,
which
by
the
colour
,
I
could
with
difficulty
discern
to
be
metal
,
and
as
many
spoon
of
the
same
composition
,
two
of
which
be
curtail
in
the
handle
,
and
the
other
in

<EOS>
Mr
Morgan
himself
enrich
this
mess
with
a
lump
of
salt
butter
,
scoop
from
an
old
gallipot
,
and
a
handful
of
onion
shorn
,
with
some
pound
pepper
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
very
much
tempt
with
the
appearance
of
this
dish
,
of
which
,
nevertheless
,
my
mess
-
mate
eat
heartily
,
advise
me
to
follow
their
example
,
as
it
be
banyan
day
,
and
we
could
have
no
meat
till
next
noon
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
already
lay
in
sufficient
for
the
occasion
;
and
therefore
desire
to
be
excuse
;
express
a
curiosity
to
know
the
meaning
of
banyan
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
that
on
Mondays
,
Wednesdays
and
Fridays
,
the
ship
's
company
have
no
allowance
of
meat
,
and
that
these
meagre
day
be
call
banyan
day
,
the
reason
of
which
they
do
not
know
;
but
I
have
since
learn
they
take
their
denomination
from
a
sect
of
devotee
in
some
part
of
the
East
Indies
,
who
never
taste
flesh
.
    
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
Thomson
lead
me
round
the
ship
,
shew
me
the
different
part
,
describe
their
use
,
and
as
far
as
he
could
,
make
me
acquaint
with
the
particular
of
the
discipline
and
oeconomy
my
practise
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
demand
of
the
boatswain
,
an
hammock
for
me
,
which
be
fling
in
a
very
neat
manner
by
my
friend
Jack
Rattlin
;
and
as
I
have
no
bed
-
cloath
,
procure
credit
for
me
with
the
purser
,
for
a
matrass
and
two
blanket
.
 
<EOS>
at
seven
a
-
clock
in
the
evening
,
Morgan
visit
the
sick
,
and
have
order
what
be
proper
for
each
,
I
assist
Thomson
in
make
up
his
prescription
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
follow
him
with
the
medicine
into
the
sick
birth
or
hospital
,
and
observe
the
situation
of
the
patient
,
I
be
much
less
surprised
to
find
people
die
on
board
,
than
astonish
to
find
any
body
recover
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
see
about
fifty
miserable
distemper
wretch
,
suspend
in
row
,
so
huddle
one
upon
another
,
that
not
more
than
fourteen
inch
of
space
be
allot
for
each
with
his
bed
and
bedding
;
and
deprive
of
the
light
of
the
day
,
as
well
as
of
fresh
air
;
breathe
nothing
but
a
noisome
atmosphere
of
the
morbid
steam
exhale
from
their
own
excrement
and
disease
body
,
devour
with
vermin
hatch
in
the
filth
that
surround
them
,
and
destitute
of
every
convenience
necessary
for
people
in
that
helpless

chapter
XXVI
<EOS>
a
disagreeable
accident
happen
to
me
in
the

<EOS>
Morgan
's
nose
be
offend
 
a
dialogue
between
him
and
the
ship
's
steward
 
upon
examination

I
find
more
cause

<EOS>
my

Cookery
 
the
manner
of

<EOS>
I
be
wake
in
the
night
by
a
dreadful
noise

<EOS>
I
could
not
comprehend
how
it
be
possible
for
the
attendant
to
come
near
those
who
hang
on
the
inside
towards
the
side
of
the
ship
,
in
order
to
assist
them
,
as
they
seem
barricado
by
those
who
lie
on
the
outside
,
and
entirely
out
of
the
reach
of
all
visitation
.
 
<EOS>
much
less
could
I
conjecture
how
my
friend
Thomson
would
be
able
to
administer
clyster
<EOS>
,
that
be
order
for
some
in
that
situation
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
see
him
thrust
his
wig
in
his
pocket
,
and
strip
himself
to
his
waistcoat
in
a
moment
,
then
creep
on
all
four
,
under
the
hammock
of
the
sick
,
and
force
up
his
bare
pate
between
two
,
keep
them
asunder
with
one
shoulder
,
until
he
have
do
his
duty
.
     
<EOS>
Eager
to
learn
the
service
,
I
desire
he
would
give
me
leave
to
perform
the
next
operation
of
that
kind
;
he
consent
,
I
undress
myself
after
his
example
,
and
crawl
along
,
the
ship
happen
to
roll
,
which
alarm
me
;
I
lay
hold
of
the
first
thing
that
come
within
my
grasp
,
with
such
violence
,
that
I
overturn
it
,
and
soon
find
by
the
smell
that
issue
upon
me
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
unlock
a
box
of
the
most
delicious
perfume
;
it
be
well
for
me
that
my
nostril
be
none
of
the
most
delicate
<EOS>
,
else
I
know
not
how
I
may
have
be
affect
by
this
vapour
,
which
diffuse
itself
all
over
the
ship
to
the
utter
discomposure
of
every
body
who
tarry
on
the
same
deck
;
 
neither
be
the
consequence
of
this
disgrace
confine
to
my
sense
of
smell
only
,
for
I
feel
my
misfortune
more
way
than
one
.
<EOS>
that
I
may
not
,
however
,
appear
altogether
disconcert
in
this
my
coup
d'essai
<EOS>
,
I
get
up
,
and
push
my
head
with
great
force
between
two
hammock
,
towards
the
middle
,
where
the
great
resistance
be
,
I
make
an
opening
indeed
,
but
not
understand
the
knack
of
dexterously
turn
my
shoulder
to
maintain
my
advantage
,
I
have
the
mortification
to
find
myself
stick
up
as
it
be
in
a
pillory
,
and
the
weight
of
three
or
four
people
bear
on
each
side
of
my
neck
,
so
that
I
be
in
danger
of
strangulation
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
remain
in
this
defenceless
posture
,
one
of
the
sick
man
,
render
peevish
by
his
distemper
,
be
so
enrage
at
the
smell
I
have
occasion
,
and
the
rude
shock
he
have
receive
from
me
in
my
elevation
,
that
with
many
bitter
reproach
,
he
seize
me
by
the
nose
,
which
he
tweak
so
unmercifully
that
I
roar
with
anguish
.
    
<EOS>
Thomson
perceive
my
condition
,
order
one
of
the
waiter
to
my
assistance
,
who
with
much
difficulty
disengage
me
from
this
embarra
,
and
hinder
me
from
take
vengeance
of
the
sick
man
,
whose
indisposition
would
not
have
screen
him
from
the
effect
of
my
indignation
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
make
an
end
of
our
ministry
for
that
time
,
we
descend
to
the
cockpit
,
my
friend
comfort
me
for
what
have
happen
,
with
a
homely
proverb
,
which
I
do
not
chuse
to
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
get
half
way
down
the
ladder
,
Mr
Morgan
,
before
he
see
us
,
have
intelligence
by
his
nose
,
of
the
approach
of
something
extraordinary
,
cry
,
"
Cot
have
mercy
upon
my
sense
!
<EOS>
I
pelieve
the
enemy
have
poarde
us
in
a
stink
-
pot
!
"
<EOS>
then
direct
his
discourse
to
the
steward
,
from
whom
he
imagine
the
odour
proceed
,
he
reprimand
him
severely
for
the
freedom
he
take
among
gentleman
of
birth
,
threatne
to
smoak
him
like
a
padger
with
sulphur
,
if
ever
he
should
presume
to
offend
his
neighbour
with
such
smell
,
for
the
future
:
<EOS>
the
steward
,
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
,
reply
with
some
warmth
,
"
I
know
of
no
smell
but
those
of
your
own
making
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
repartee
introduce
a
smart
dialogue
,
in
which
the
Welchman
undertake
to
prove
,
that
though
the
stench
he
complain
of
,
do
not
flow
from
the
steward
's
own
body
,
he
be
nevertheless
the
author
of
it
,
by
serve
out
damage
provision
to
the
ship
's
company
;
and
in
particular
,
putrified
cheese
,
from
the
use
of
which
only
,
he
affirm
,
such
unsavoury
steam
could
arise
.
     
<EOS>
then
he
launch
out
into
praise
of
good
cheese
,
of
which
he
give
the
analysis
;
explain
the
different
kind
of
that
commodity
,
with
the
method
practise
to
make
and
preserve
it
;
and
conclude
with
observing
,
that
in
yield
good
cheese
,
the
county
of
Glamorgan
may
vie
with
Cheshire
itself
,
and
be
much
superior
to
it
in
the
produce
of
goat
and
putter
.
 
<EOS>
I
gather
from
this
conversation
,
that
if
I
go
into
the
birth
in
my
present
pickle
,
I
should
be
no
welcome
guest
,
and
therefore
desire
Mr
Thomson
to
go
before
,
and
represent
my
calamity
;
at
which
the
first
mate
express
some
concern
,
go
upon
deck
immediately
,
take
his
way
through
the
cable
tire
,
and
by
the
main
hatchway
,
to
avoid
encounter
with
me
;
desire
me
to
clean
myself
as
soon
as
possible
,
for
he
intend
to
regale
himself
with
a
dish
of
salmagundy
and
a
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
set
about
this
disagreeable
business
,
and
soon
find
I
have
more
cause
of
complaint
than
I
at
first
imagine
:
for
I
perceive
some
guest
have
honour
me
with
their
company
,
whose
visit
I
do
not
at
all
think
seasonable
;
neither
do
they
seem
inclined
to
leave
me
in
a
hurry
,
be
in
possession
of
my
chief
quarter
,
where
they
feed
without
reserve
at
the
expence
of
my
blood
.
 
<EOS>
but
consider
it
would
be
much
easy
to
extirpate
this
ferocious
colony
in
the
infancy
of
their
settlement
,
than
after
they
should
be
multiply
and
naturalize
to
the
soil
,
I
take
the
advice
of
my
friend
,
who
,
to
prevent
such
misfortune
,
go
always
closs
shave
,
and
make
the
boy
of
our
mess
cut
off
my
hair
,
which
have
be
grow
since
I
leave
the
service
of
Lawement
.
<EOS>
the
second
mate
lend
me
an
old
bob
wig
to
supply
the
loss
of
that
covering
.
    
<EOS>
this
affair
be
end
,
and
every
thing
adjust
in
the
good
manner
my
circumstance
would
permit
,
the
descendant
of
Caractacus
return
,
and
order
the
boy
to
bring
a
piece
of
salt
beef
from
the
brine
,
cut
off
a
slice
and
mix
it
with
an
equal
quantity
of
onion
,
which
season
with
a
moderate
proportion
of
pepper
and
salt
,
he
bring
it
into
a
consistence
with
oil
and
vinegar
.
 
<EOS>
then
taste
the
dish
,
assure
us
,
it
be
the
good
salmagundie
,
that
ever
he
make
,
and
recommend
it
to
our
palate
with
such
heartiness
,
that
I
could
not
help
do
honour
to
his
preparation
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
sooner
swallow
a
mouthful
,
than
I
think
my
entrail
be
scorch
,
and
endeavour
with
a
deluge
of
small
beer
,
to
allay
the
heat
it
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
supper
be
over
,
Mr
Morgan
have
smoake
a
couple
of
pipe
,
and
supply
the
moisture
he
have
expend
with
as
many
can
of
flip
,
of
which
we
all
partook
,
a
certain
yawning
begin
to
admonish
me
,
that
it
be
high
time
to
repair
by
sleep
<EOS>
the
injury
I
have
suffer
from
want
of
rest
the
preceede
night
;
which
be
perceive
by
my
companion
,
whose
time
of
repose
be
by
this
time
arrive

they
propose
we
should
turn
in
,
or
in
other
word
,
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Our
hammock
,
which
hang
parallel
to
one
another
,
on
the
outside
of
our
birth
,
be
immediately
unlashed
,
and
I
beheld
each
of
my
mess
-
mate
spring
with
great
agility
into
his
respective
nest
,
where
they
seem
to
lie
conceal
,
very
much
at
their
ease
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
some
time
before
I
could
prevail
upon
myself
to
trust
my
carcase
at
such
a
distance
from
the
ground
,
in
a
narrow
bag
,
out
of
which
<EOS>
,
I
imagine
,
I
should
be
apt
,
on
the
least
motion
in
my
sleep
,
to
tumble
down
at
the
hazard
of
break
my
bone
.
<EOS>
I
suffer
myself
,
however
,
to
be
persuade
,
and
take
a
leap
to
get
in
,
throw
myself
quite
over
,
with
such
violence
,
that
have
I
not
luckily
get
hold
of
Thomson
's
hammock
,
I
should
have
pitch
upon
my
head
on
the
other
side
,
and
in
all
likelihood
fracture
my
scull
.
     
<EOS>
after
some
fruitless
effort
,
I
succeed
at
last
;
but
the
apprehension
of
the
jeopardy
in
which
I
believe
myself
,
withstand
all
the
attack
of
sleep
,
till
towards
the
morning
-
watch
,
when
in
spite
of
my
fear
,
I
be
over

with
slumber

<EOS>
tho

<EOS>
I
do
not
long
enjoy
this
comfortable
situation

be
arrouse
with
a
noise
so
loud
and
shrill
,
that
I
think
the
drum
of
my
ear
be
burst
by
it
;
this
be
follow
by
a
dreadful
summon
pronounce
by
a
hoarse
voice
,
which
I
could
not
understand
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
debate
with
myself
whether

I
should
wake
my

enquire
into

with
such
interruption
every

the

hour

<EOS>
be
now
more

of
of
my

myself
again
to

chapter
XXVII
<EOS>
I
acquire
the
friendship
of
the
surgeon
,
who
procure
a
warrant
for
me
,
and
make
me
a
present
of
cloath
 
<EOS>
a
battle
between
a
midshipman
and
me
 
<EOS>
the
surgeon
leave
the

<EOS>
the
captain
come
on
board
with
another
surgeon
 
a
dialogue
between
the
captain
and
Morgan
 
<EOS>
the
sick
be
order
to
be
bring
upon
the
quarter
-
deck
and
examine
 
the
consequence
of
that
order
 
<EOS>
a
madman
accuse
Morgan
,
and
be
set
at
liberty
by
command
of
the
captain
,
whom
he
instantly
attack
and
pummel
without
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
busied
with
my
friend
in
this
practice
,
the
doctor
chance
to
pass
by
the
place
where
we
be
,
and
stop
to
observe
me
,
appear
very
well
satisfied
with
my
method
of
application
;
and
afterwards
send
for
me
to
his
cabbin
,
where
,
have
examine
me
touch
my
skill
in
surgery
,
and
the
particular
of
my
fortune
,
interested
himself
so
far
in
my
behalf
,
as
to
promise
his
assistance
in
procure
a
warrant
for
me
,
see
I
have
be
already
find
qualified
at
Surgeon
's
hall
,
for
the
station
I
now
fill
on
board
;
and
this
he
the
more
cordially
engage
in
,
when
he
understand
I
be
nephew
to
lieutenant
Bowling
,
for
whom
he
express
a
particular
regard
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
could
learn
from
his
discourse
,
that
he
do
not
intend
to
go
to
sea
again
with
captain
Oakhum
,
have
,
as
he
think
,
be
indifferently
use
by
him
during
the
last
voyage
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
live
tolerably
easy
,
in
expectation
of
preferment
,
I
be
not
altogether
without
mortification
,
which
I
not
only
suffer
from
the
rude
insult
of
the
sailor
,
and
petty
officer
,
among
whom
I
be
know
by
the
name
of
Loblolly
Boy
;
but
also
from
the
disposition
of
Morgan
,
who
,
though
friendly
in
the
main
,
be
often
very
troublesome
with
his
pride
,
which
expect
a
good
deal
of
submission
from
me
,
and
delighted
in
recapitulate
the
favour
I
have
receive
at
his
hand
.
    
<EOS>
about
six
week
after
my
arrival
on
board
,
the
surgeon
bid
me
follow
him
into
his
cabbin
,
present
a
warrant
to
me
,
by
which
I
be
appoint
surgeon
's
third
mate
on
board
the
Thunder
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
have
procure
by
his
interest
at
the
Navy
-
office
;
as
also
another
for
himself
,
by
virtue
of
which
he
be
remove
into
a
second
rate
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
his
kindness
in
the
strong
term
my
gratitude
could
suggest
,
and
profess
my
sorrow
at
the
prospect
of
lose
such
a
valuable
friend
,
to
whom
I
hope
to
have
recommend
myself
still
further
,
by
my
respectful
and
diligent
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
generosity
rest
not
here
;
 
for
,
before
he
leave
the
ship
,
he
make
me
a
present
,
of
a
chest
and
some
cloath
,
that
enable
me
to
support
the
rank
to
which
he
have
raise
me
.
     
<EOS>
I
find
my
spirit
revive
with
my
good
fortune
;
and
now
I
be
an
officer
,
resolve
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
my
station
,
against
all
opposition
or
affront
;
nor
be
it
long
before
I
have
occasion
to
exert
my
resolution
;
my
old
enemy
the
midshipman
(
whose
name
be
Crampley
)
entertain
an
implacable
animosity
against
me
,
for
the
disgrace
he
have
suffer
on
my
account
,
have
since
that
time
take
all
opportunity
of
revile
and
ridicule
me
,
when
I
be
not
intitle
to
retort
his
bad
usage
.
 
<EOS>
and
even
after
I
have
be
rate
on
the
book
,
and
muster
as
surgeon
's
mate
,
do
not
think
fit
to
restrain
his
insolence
.
 
<EOS>
in
particular
,
be
one
day
present
,
while
I
dress
a
wound
in
a
sailor
's
leg
,
he
begin
to
sing
a
song
,
which
I
think
highly
injurious
to
the
honour
of
my
country
,
and
therefore
signify
my
resentment
,
by
observe
,
that
the
Scots
always
lay
their
account
in
find
enemy
among
the
ignorant
,
insignificant
and
malicious
.
 
<EOS>
this
unexpected
piece
of
assurance
enrage
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
lend
me
a
blow
on
the
face
,
which
I
verily
think
have
demolish
my
cheek
-
bone
;
I
be
not
slow
in
return
the
obligation
,
and
the
affair
begin
to
be
very
serious
,
when
by
accident
Mr
Morgan
,
and
one
of
the
master
's
mate
,
come
that
way
,
interpose
,
and
inquire
into
the
cause
,
endeavour
to
promote
a
reconciliation
;
but
find
us
both
exasperate
to
the
uttermost
,
and
bent
against
accommodation
,
they
advise
us
,
either
to
leave
our
difference
undecided
till
we
should
have
an
opportunity
of
terminate
it
on
shore
,
like
gentleman
,
or
else
chuse
a
proper
place
on
board
,
and
bring
it
to
an
issue
by
box
.
    
<EOS>
this
last
expedient
be
greedily
embrace
;
and
be
forthwith
conduct
to
the
ground
<EOS>
propose
,
we
stript
in
a
moment
,
and
begin
a
very
furious
contest
,
in
which
I
soon
find
myself
inferior
to
my
antagonist
,
not
so
much
in
strength
and
agility
,
as
in
skill
,
which
he
have
acquire
in
the
school
at
Hockley
in
the
Hole
and
Tottenham
-
Court
.
 
<EOS>
many
cross
-
buttock
do
I
sustain
,
and
peg
on
the
stomach
without
number
,
till
at
last
,
my
breath
be
quite
go
,
as
well
as
my
vigour
waft
,
I
grow
desperate
,
and
collect
all
my
spirit
in
one
effort
,
throw
in
at
once
head
,
hand
,
and
foot
with
such
violence
,
that
I
drive
my
antagonist
three
pace
backward
into
the
main
hatch
-
way
,
down
which
he
fall
,
and
pitch
upon
his
head
and
right
shoulder
,
remain
without
sense
and
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Morgan
look
down
,
and
see
him
lie
in
that
condition
,
cry
,
"
upon
my
conscience
,
as
I
be
a
christian
sinner
<EOS>
(
look
you
)
<EOS>
I
believe
his
pattle
be
all
ofer
;
but
I
take
you
all
to
witness
that
there
be
no
treachery
in
the
case
,
and
that
he
have
suffer
by
the
chance
of
war
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
descend
to
the
deck
below
,
to
examine
into
the
situation
of
my
adversary
;
and
leave
me
very
little
pleased
with
my
victory
,
as
I
find
myself
not
only
terribly
bruise
,
but
likewise
in
danger
of
be
call
to
account
for
the
death
of
Crampley
:
<EOS>
but
this
fear
vanish
when
my
fellow
-
mate
,
have
by
bleed
him
in
the
juglar
,
bring
him
to
himself
,
and
assure
himself
of
the
state
of
his
body
,
call
up
to
me
,
to
be
under
no
concern
,
for
the
midshipman
have
receive
no
other
damage
than
as
pretty
a
luxation
of
the
os
humeri
,
as
one
would
desire
to
see
on
a
summer
's
day
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
information
,
I
crawl
down
to
the
cockpit
,
and
acquaint
Thomson
with
the
affair
,
who
,
provide
himself
with
bandage
,
&
c.
necessary
for
the
occasion
,
go
up
to
assist
Mr
Morgan
in
the
reduction
of
the
dislocation
.
     
<EOS>
when
this
be
successfully
perform
,
they
wish
me
joy
of
the
event
of
the
combat
;
and
the
Welchman
,
after
observe
,
that
in
all
likelihood
,
the
ancient
Scots
and
Britons
be
the
same
people
,
bid
me
"
Praise
Cot
for
put
mettle
in
my
pelly
,
and
strength
in
my
limb
to
support
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
acquire
such
reputation
by
this
recounter
(
which
last
twenty
minute
)
that
every
body
become
more
cautious
of
his
behaviour
towards
me
;
though
Crampley
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
talk
very
high
,
and
threaten
to
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
retrieve
on
shore
,
the
honour
he
have
lose
by
an
accident
,
from
which
I
could
justly
claim
no
merit
.
    
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
captain
Oakhum
,
have
receive
sailing
order
,
come
on
board
,
and
bring
along
with
him
a
surgeon
of
his
own
country
,
who
soon
make
us
sensible
of
the
loss
we
suffer
in
the
departure
of
doctor
Atkins
;
be
grossly
ignorant
,
and
intolerably
assume
,
false
,
vindictive
,
and
unforgive
;
a
merciless
tyrant
to
his
inferior
,
an
abject
sycophant
to
those
above
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
after
the
captain
come
on
board
,
our
first
mate
,
accord
to
custom
,
go
to
wait
on
him
with
a
sick
list
,
which
when
this
grim
commander
have
peruse
;
he
cry
with
a
stern
countenance
,
"
blood
and
oon

<EOS>
sixty

one

Harkee
you

I
will
have
no

in
my

by
G

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Welchman
reply
,
he
should
be
very
glad
to
find
no
sick
people
on
board
;
but
while
it
be
otherwise
,
he
do
no
more
than
his
duty
in
present
him
with
a
list
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
your
list
may
be
d####n'd
,
(
say
the
captain
,
throw
it
at
him
)
<EOS>
I
say
,
there
shall
be
no
sick
in
this
ship
while
I
have
the
command
of
her
.
"
     
<EOS>
Mr
Morgan
be
nettle
at
this
treatment
,
tell
him
,
his
indignation
ought
to
be
direct
to
Got
Almighty
,
who
visit
his
people
with
distemper
,
and
not
to
him
,
who
contribute
all
in
his
power
towards
their
cure
.
<EOS>
the
Bashaw
not
be
use
to
such
behaviour
in
any
of
his
officer
,
be
enrage
to
fury
at
this
satirical
insinuation
,
and
stamp
with
his
foot
,
call
him
insolent
scoundrel
,
threatne
to
have
him
pinion
to
the
deck
,
if
he
should
presume
to
utter
another
syllable
.
<EOS>
but
the
blood
of
Caractacus
be
thoroughly
heat
,
disdain
to
be
restrict
by
such
a
command
,
and
begin
to
manifest
itself
in
,
"
Captain
Oakoum
,
I
be
a
shentleman
of
birth
and
parentage
<EOS>
(
look
you
)
and
peradventure
,
I
be
moreover
 
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
his
harrangue
be
break
off
by
the
captain
's
steward
,
who
be
Morgan
's
countryman
,
hurry
him
out
of
the
cabbin
before
he
have
time
to
exasperate
his
master
to
a
great
degree
,
which
would
certainly
have
be
the
case
;
for
the
indignant
Welchman
,
could
hardly
be
hinder
by
his
friend
's
argument
and
intreatie
,
from
re
-
enter
the
presence
chamber
,
and
defy
captain
Oakhum
to
his
tooth
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
appease
at
length
,
and
come
down
to
the
birth
,
where
find
Thomson
and
me
at
work
prepare
medicine
,
he
bid
us
leave
off
our
lapour
and
go
to
play
,
for
the
captain
,
by
his
sole
word
and
power
and
command
,
have
drive
sicknes
a
pegging
to
the
tevil
,
and
there
be
no
more
malady
on
poard
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
drink
off
a
gill
of
brandy
,
sigh
grievously
three
time
,
pour
forth
an
ejaculation
of
"
got
pless
my
heart
,
liver
,
and
lung
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
begin
to
sing
a
Welch
song
with
great
earnestness
of
visage
,
voice
and
gesture
.
     
<EOS>
I
could
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
this
singular
phaenomenon
,
and
see
by
the
look
of
Thomson
,
who
at
the
same
time
,
shake
his
head
,
that
he
suspect
poor
Cadwallader
's
brain
be
unsettle
.
<EOS>
He
perceive
our
amazement
,
tell
us
,
he
would
explain
the
mystery
;
but
at
the
same
time
,
bid
us
take
notice
,
that
he
have
live
poy
,
patchelor
,
married
man

widower
,
almost
forty
year
,
and
in
all
that
time

there
be
no
man
nor
mother
's
son
in
the
whole
world
,
who
durst
use
him
so
ill
as
captain
Oakhum
have
do
.
<EOS>
then
he
acquaint
us
with
the
dialogue
that
pass
between
them
,
as
I
have
already
relate
it
;
and
have
no
sooner
finish
this
narration
,
than
he
receive
a
message
from
the
surgeon
,
to
bring
the
sick
-
list
to
the
quarter
-
deck
,
for
the
captain
have
order
all
the
patient
thither
to
be
review
.
 
<EOS>
this
inhuman
order
shock
us
extremely
,
as
we
know
it
would
be
impossible
to
carry
some
of
them
on
the
deck
,
without
imminent
danger
of
their
life
;
but
as
we
likewise
know
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
for
us
to
remonstrate
against
it
,
we
repair
to
the
quarter
-
deck
in
a
body
,
to
see
this
extraordinary
muster
;
<EOS>
Morgan
observe
by
the
way
,
that
the
captain
be
go
to
send
to
the
other
world
,
a
great
many
evidence
to
testify
against
himself
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
appear
upon
deck
,
the
captain
bid
the
doctor
,
who
stand
bow
at
his
right
hand
,
look
at
these
lazy
,
lubberly
son
of
bitch
,
who
be
good
for
nothing
on
board
,
but
to
eat
the
king
's
provision
,
and
encourage
idleness
in
the
skulker
.
 
<EOS>
the
surgeon
grin
approbation
,
and
take
the
list
,
begin
to
examine
the
complaint
of
each
as
they
could
crawl
to
the
place
appoint
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
who
come
under
his
cognizance
,
be
a
poor
fellow
just
free
of
a
fever
,
which
have
weaken
him
so
much
,
that
he
could
hardly
stand
.
     
<EOS>
Mr
Mackshane
(
for
that
be
the
doctor
's
name
)
<EOS>
have
feel
his
pulse
,
protest
he
be
as
well
as
any
man
in
the
world
;
and
the
captain
deliver
him
over
to
the
boatswain
's
mate
,
with
order
that
he
should
receive
a
round
dozen
at
the
gang
-
way
immediately
,
for
counterfeit
himself
sick
when
he
be
not
;
 
but
before
the
discipline
could
be
execute
,
the
man
dropt
down
on
the
deck
,
and
have
well
nigh
perish
under
the
hand
of
the
executioner
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
patient
to
be
consider
,
labour
under
a
quartan
ague
,
and
be
then
,
in
his
interval
of
health
,
discover
no
other
symptom
of
distemper
,
than
a
pale
meagre
countenance
,
and
emaciate
body
;
upon
which
,
he
be
declare
fit
for
duty
,
and
turn
over
to
the
boatswain
;
 
but
be
resolve
to
disgrace
the
doctor
,
die
upon
the
forecastle
next
day
,
during
his
cold
fit
.
 
<EOS>
the
third
complain
of
a
pleuretic
stitch
,
and
spitting
of
blood
,
for
which
doctor
Mackshane
prescribe
exercise
at
the
pump
to
promote
expectoration
;
but
whether
this
be
improper
for
one
in
his
situation
,
or
that
it
be
use
to
excess
,
I
know
not
,
but
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
he
be
suffocate
with
a
deluge
of
blood
that
issue
from
his
lung
.
 
<EOS>
a
fourth
,
with
much
difficulty
climb
to
the
quarter
-
deck
,
be
load
with
a
monstrous
ascite
or
dropsy
,
that
invade
his
chest
so
much
,
he
could
scarce
fetch
his
breath
;
but
his
disease
be
interpret
into
fat
,
occasion
by
idleness
and
excess
of
eat
<EOS>
,
he
be
order
,
with
a
view
to
promote
perspiration
and
enlarge
his
chest
,
to
go
aloft
immediately
:
It
be
in
vain
for
this
unwieldy
wretch
,
to
alledge
his
utter
incapacity
,
the
boatswain
's
driver
be
command
to
whip
him
up
with
a
cat
and
nine
tail
:
    
<EOS>
the
smart
of
this
application
make
him
exert
himself
so
much
,
that
he
actually
arrive
at
the
foot
-
hook
-
shrouds
,
but
when
the
enormous
weight
of
his
body
have
nothing
else
to
support
it
than
his
weaken
arm
,
either
out
of
spite
or
necessity
,
he
quit
his
hold
,
and
plump
into
the
sea
,
where
he
must
have
be
drown
,
have
not
a
sailor
who
be
in
a
boat
along
-
side
,
save
his
life
,
by
keep
him
afloat
,
till
he
be
hoist
on
board
by
a
tackle
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
and
disagreeable
to
describe
the
fate
of
every
miserable
object
that
suffer
by
the
inhumanity
and
ignorance
of
the
captain
and
surgeon
,
who
so
wantonly
sacrifice
the
life
of
their
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
many
be
bring
up
in
the
height
of
fever
,
and
render
delirious
by
the
injury
they
suffer
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
some
give
up
the
ghost
in
the
presence
of
their
inspector
;
and
other
,
who
be
order
to
their
duty
,
languish
a
few
day
at
work
,
among
their
fellow
,
and
then
depart
without
any
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
the
number
of
sick
be
reduce
to
less
than
a
dozen
;
and
the
author
of
this
reduction
be
applaud
themselves
for
the
service
they
have
do
to
their
king
and
country
,
when
the
boatswain
's
mate
inform
his
honour
,
that
there
be
a
man
below
lash
to
his
hammock
by
the
direction
of
the
doctor
's
mate
,
and
that
he
beg
hard
to
be
release
;
affirming
,
he
have
be
so
maltreat
only
for
a
grudge
Mr
Morgan
bear
to
him
,
and
that
he
be
as
much
in
his
sense
as
any
man
aboard
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
hear
this
,
dart
a
severe
look
at
the
Welchman
,
and
order
the
man
to
be
bring
up
immediately
:
    
upon
which
,
Morgan
protest
with
great
fervency
,
that
the
person
in
question
be
as
mad
as
a
March
-
hare
;
and
beg
for
the
the
love
of
Got
,
they
would
at
least
keep
his
arm
pinion
during
his
examination
,
to
prevent
him
from
do
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
this
request
the
commander
grant
for
his
own
sake
,
and
the
patient
be
produce
,
who
insist
upon
his
being
in
his
right
wit
with
such
calmness
and
strength
of
argument
,
that
every
body
present
be
incline
to
believe
him
,
except
Morgan
,
who
affirm
there
be
no
trusting
to
appearance
;
for
he
himself
have
be
so
much
impose
upon
by
his
behaviour
two
day
before
,
that
he
have
actually
unbound
him
with
his
own
hand
,
and
have
well
nigh
be
murder
for
his
pain
<EOS>
:
this
be
confirm
by
the
evidence
of
one
of
the
waiter
,
who
declare
,
he
have
pull
this
patient
from
the
doctor
's
mate
,
whom
he
have
get
down
and
almost
strangle
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
the
man
answer
,
that
the
witness
be
a
creature
of
Morgan
's
,
and
be
suborn
to
give
his
testimony
against
him
by
the
malice
of
the
mate

whom
the

have
affront

by
discover
to
the
people
on

that
Mr
Morgan

this

Captain

without

to
be
unfettere
;
at
the

time

threaten
to
make
Morgan

situation

him
for

the

he
get
up

cry

me
to

out

for

We
do
not

this
caution

accordingly
get
up
on
the
poop

<EOS>
whence
we

the
maniac
(

fly
at

cry

the

carry
into
his

so
enraged
with
the
treatment
he
have
receive

that
he
order
the
fellow
to
be
bring
before
him
,
that
he
may
have
the
pleasure
of
pistole
him
with
his
own

;
and
would
certainly
have
satisfy
his
revenge
in
this
manner
,
have
not
the
first
lieutenant
remonstrate
against
it
,
by
observe
that
in
all
appearance
,
the
fellow
be
not
mad
but
desperate
;
that
he
have
be
hire
by
some
enemy
of
the
captain
to
assassinate
him
,
and
therefore
ought
to
be
keep
in
iron
till
he
could
be
bring
to
a
court

martial

which
,
no

would
sift
the
affair
to

bottom

which

important
discovery
may
be
make

and
then
sentence
the
criminal
to
a

adequate

improbable
as
it

have
the
desire
effect
upon
the

be
exactly
calculate
for
the
meridian
of

more
especially
,
as
doctor
Mackshane
espouse
this
opinion
,
in
consequence
of
his
previous
declaration
that
the
man
be
not
mad

<EOS>
Morgan
find
there
be
no
more
damage
do
,
could
not
help
discover
by
his
countenance
,
the
pleasure
he
enjoy
on
this
occasion
;
and
while
he
bathe
the
doctor
's
face
with
an
embrocation
,
venture
to
ask
him
,
whether
he
think
there
be
more
fool
or
madman
on
board
?
<EOS>
but
he
would
have
be
wise
in
contain
this
sally
,
which
his
patient
carefully
lay
up
in
his
memory
,
to
be
take
notice
of
at
a
more
fit
season
.
 
<EOS>
mean
while
we
weigh
anchor
,
and
on
our
way
to
the
Downs
,
the
madman
,
who
be
treat
as
a
prisoner
,
take
an
opportunity
,
while
the
centinel
attend
him
at
the
head
,
to
leap
over

board
,
and
frustrate
the
revenge
of
the
captain

<EOS>
We
staid
not
long
at
the
down
,
but
take
the
benefit
of
the
first
easterly
wind
to
go
round
to
Spithead
;
where
have
receive
on
board
provision
for
six
month

we
sail
from
St

,
in
the
grand
fleet
bind
for
the
West

Indies
on
the
ever
memorable
expedition
of
Carthagena

<EOS>
It
be
not
without
great
mortification
,
I
see
myself
on
the
point
of
be
transport
to
such
a
distant
and
unhealthy
climate
,
destitute
of
every
convenience
that
could
render
such
a
voyage
supportable
;
and
under
the
dominion
of
an
arbitrary
tyrant
,
whose
command
be
almost
intolerable
:
<EOS>
however
,
as
these
complaint
be
common
to
a
great
many
on
board
,
I
resolve
to
submit
patiently
to
my
fate
,
and
contrive
to
make
myself
as
easy
as
the
nature
of
the
case
would
allow
.
 
<EOS>
We
get
out
of
the
channel
with
a
prosperous
breeze
,
which
die
away
,
leave
us
becalm
about
fifty
league
to
the
westward
of
the
lizard
:
<EOS>
but
this
state
of
inaction
do
not
last
long
;
for
next
night
our
main

top
-
sail
be
split
by
the
wind
,
which
in
the
morning
encrease
to
a
hurricane
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
waken
by
a
most
horrible
din
,
occasion
by
the
play
of
the
gun
carriage
upon
the
deck
above
,
the
creaking
of
cabin
,
the
howling
of
the
wind
through
the
shroud
,
the
confused
noise
of
the
ship
's
crew
,
the
pipe
of
the
boatswain
and
his
mate
,
the
trumpet
of
the
lieutenant

and
the
clanking
of
the
chain

pump

<EOS>
Morgan
,
who
have
never
be
at
sea
before
,
turn
out
in
a
great
hurry

crying
,
"
got

mercy
and
compassion
upon
us

<EOS>
I
believe
we
have
get
upon
the
confine
of
Lucifer

<EOS>
"
 
while
poor
Thomson
lie
quake
in
his
hammock
,
put
up
petition
to
heaven
for
our
safety
.
     
<EOS>
I
get
out
of
bed
and
join
the
Welchman
,
with
whom
(
after
have
fortify
ourselves
with
brandy
)
<EOS>
I
go
above
;
but
if
my
sense
of
hearing
be
startle
before
,
how
must
my
sight
be
appal
in
behold
the
effect
of
the
storm
?
<EOS>
the
sea
be
swell
into
billow
mountain
-
high
,
on
the
top
of
which
our
ship
sometimes
hang
,
as
if
it
be
about
to
be
precipitate
to
the
abyss
below
!
<EOS>
sometimes
we
sunk
between
two
wave
that
rise
on
each
side
high
than
our
topmast
head
,
and
threatne
by
dash
together
,
to
overwhelm
us
in
a
moment
!
<EOS>
of
all
our
fleet
,
consist
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
sail
,
scarce
twelve
appear
,
and
these
drive
under
their
bare
pole
,
at
the
mercy
of
the
temp
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
mast
of
one
of
them
give
way
,
and
tumble
over

board
with
a
hideous
crash
!
<EOS>
nor
be
the
prospect
in
our
own
ship
much
more
agreeable
;
 
a
number
of
officer
and
sailor
run
backward
and
forward
with
distraction
in
their
look
,
hollow
to
one
another
,
and
unknowe
what
they
should
attend
to
first
.
<EOS>
some
clung
to
the
yard
,
endeavour
to
unbend
the
sail
that
be
split
into
a
thousand
piece
flap
in
the
wind
;
other
try
to
furl
those
which
be
yet
whole
,
while
the
mast
,
at
every
pitch
,
bent
and
quiver
like
twig
,
as
if
they
would
have
shiver
into
innumerable
splinter
!
 
<EOS>
while
I
consider
this
scene
with
equal
terror
and
astonishment
,
one
of
the
main

brace
break
,
by
the
shock
whereof
two
sailor
be
fling
from
the
yard
's
arm
into
the
sea

where
they
perish
,
and
poor
Jack
Rattlin
throw
down
upon
the
deck
,
at
the
expence
of
a
break
leg
.
<EOS>
Morgan
and
I
run
immediately
to
his
assistance
,
and
find
a
splinter
of
the
shin
-
bone
thrust
by
the
violence
of
the
fall
through
the
skin
:
    
<EOS>
as
this
be
a
case
of
too
great
consequence
to
be
treat
without
the
authority
of
the
doctor
,
I
go
down
to
his
cabin
,
to
inform
him
of
the
accident
,
as
well
as
to
bring
up
dressing
,
which
we
always
keep
ready
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
I
enter
his
apartment
without
any
ceremony
,
and
by
the
glimmering
of
a
lamp
,
perceive
him
on
his
knee
,
before
something
that
very
much
resemble
a
crucifix
;
but
this
I
will
not
insist
upon
,
that
I
may
not
seem
too
much
a
slave
to
common
report
,
which
indeed
assist
my
conjecture
on
this
occasion
,
by
represent
doctor
Mackshane
as
a
member
of
the
church
of
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
he
get
up
in
a
sort
of
confusion
,
occasion
(
I
suppose
)
by
his
be
disturb
in
his
devotion
,
and
in
a
trice
,
snatch
the
object
of
my
suspicion
from
my
sight
.
 
<EOS>
after
make
an
apology
for
my
intrusion
,
I
acquaint
him
with
the
situation
of
Rattlin
,
but
could
by
no
mean
prevail
upon
him
to
visit
him
on
deck
where
he
lie
;
he
bid
me
desire
the
boatswain
to
order
some
of
the
man
to
carry
him
down
to
the
cockpit
,
and
in
the
mean
time
he
would
direct
Thomson
in
get
ready
the
dressing
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
signify
to
the
boatswain
the
doctor
's
desire
,
he
swear
a
terrible
oath
,
that
he
could
not
spare
one
man
from
the
deck
,
because
he
expect
the
mast
would
go
by
the
board
every
minute
.
 
<EOS>
this
piece
of
information
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
my
peace
of
mind
;
however
,
as
my
friend
Rattlin
complain
very
much
,
with
the
assistance
of
Morgan
,
I
support
him
to
the
low
deck
,
whither
Mr
Mackshane
,
after
much
intreaty
,
venture
to
come
,
attend
by
Thomson
with
a
boxful
of
dressing
,
and
his
own
servant
,
who
carry
a
whole
set
of
capital
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
He
examine
the
fracture
and
the
wound
,
and
conclude
from
a
livid
colour
extend
itself
upon
the
limb
,
that
a
mortification
would
ensue
,
resolve
to
amputate
the
leg
immediately
.
     
<EOS>
this
be
a
dreadful
sentence
to
the
patient
,
who
recruit
himself
with
a
quid
of
tobacco
,
pronounce
with
a
woful
countenance
,
"
what
!
<EOS>
be
there
no
remedy
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
must
I
be
dock'd
?
<EOS>
can
not
you
splice
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
assuredly
,
doctor
Mackshane
(
say
the
first
mate
)
with
submission
,
and
deference
,
and
veneration
to
your
superior
ability
,
and
opportunity
,
and
station
<EOS>
(
look
you
)
<EOS>
I
do
apprehend
,
and
conjecture
,
and
aver
,
that
there
be
no
occasion
nor
necessity
to
smite
off
this
poor
man
's
leg
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
God
almighty
bless
you
,
dear
Welchman
!
<EOS>
(
cry
Rattlin
)
<EOS>
may
you
have
fair
wind
and
weather
wheresoever
you
be
bind
,
and
come
to
an
anchor
in
the
road
of
heaven
at
last
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mackshane
,
very
much
incensed
at
his
mate
's
differ
in
opinion
from
him
so
openly
,
answer
,
that
he
be
not
bind
to
give
an
account
of
his
practice
to
him
;
and
in
a
peremptory
tone
,
order
him
to
apply
the
tourniquet
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
sight
of
which
,
Jack
start
up
,
cry
,
"
avast

avast

<EOS>
d####n
<EOS>
my

if
you

your

<EOS>
Mr

lend
a
hand
towards
saving
of
my
precious
limb
?
<EOS>
Odd

heart
,
if
lieutenant
Bowling
be
here
,
he
would
not
suffer
Jack
Rattlin
's
leg
to
be
be
chop
off
like
a
piece
of
old
junk
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
pathetic
address
to
me
,
join
to
my
inclination
to
serve
my
honest
friend
,
and
the
reason
I
have
to
believe
there
be
no
danger
in
delay
the
amputation
,
induce
me
to
declare
myself
of
the
first
mate
's
opinion
,
and
affirm
that
the
preternatural
colour
of
the
skin
,
be
owe
to
an
inflammation
occasion
by
a
contusion
,
and
common
in
all
such
case
,
without
any
indication
of
an
approach
gangrene
.
    
<EOS>
Morgan
,
who
have
a
great
opinion
of
my
skill
,
manifestly
exult
in
my
fellowship
,
and
ask
Thomson
's
sentiment
of
the
matter
,
in
hope
of
strengthen
our
association
with
him
too
;
but
he
be
of
a
meek
disposition
,
and
either
dread
the
enmity
of
the
surgeon
,
or
speak
the
dictate
of
his
own
judgment
,
in
a
modest
manner
,
espouse
the
opinion
of
Mackshane
,
who
by
this
time
,
have
consult
with
himself
,
determine
to
act
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
screen
himself
from
censure
;
and
at
the
same
time
revenge
himself
on
us
,
for
our
arrogance
in
contradict
him
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
demand
to
know
if
we
would
undertake
to
cure
the
leg
at
our
peril
;
that
is
,
be
answerable
for
the
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
Morgan
reply
,
that
the
life
of
his
creature
be
in
the
hand
of
Got
alone
;
and
it
would
be
great
presumption
in
him
to
undertake
for
an
event
that
be
in
the
power
of
his
maker
,
no
more
than
the
doctor
could
promise
to
cure
all
the
sick
to
whom
he
administer
his
assistance
;
but
if
the
patient
would
put
himself
under
our
direction
,
we
would
do
our
endeavour
to
bring
his
distemper
to
a
favourable
issue
,
to
which
,
at
present
,
we
see
no
obstruction
.
 
<EOS>
I
signify
my
concurrence
;
and
Rattlin
be
so
over
-
joy
,
that
shake
us
both
by
the
hand
,
he
swear
no
body
else
should
touch
him
,
and
if
he
die
,
his
blood
should
be
upon
his
own
head
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mackshane
,
flatter
himself
with
the
prospect
of
our
miscarriage
,
go
away
,
and
leave
us
to
manage
it
as
we
should
think
proper
;
accordingly
,
have
saw
off
part
of
the
splinter
that
stick
through
the
skin
,
we
reduce
the
fracture
,
dress
the
wound
,
apply
the
eighteen
-
tail
bandage
,
and
put
the
leg
in
a
box
,
secundum
artem
.
     
<EOS>
every
thing
succeed
accord
to
our
wish
,
and
we
have
the
satisfaction
,
of
not
only
preserve
the
poor
fellow
's
leg
,
but
likewise
of
render
the
doctor
contemptible
among
the
ship
's
company
,
who
have
all
their
eye
on
us
during
the
course
of
this
cure

which
be
compleate
in
six

CHAPTER
XXIX
Mackshane
's
malice
 
<EOS>
I
be
take
up
and

for
a
spy
 
Morgan
meet
with
the

fate
 
<EOS>
Thomson

for
his

Morgan

release
to
assist
the
surgeon
during
an
engagement
with
some
french
ship
of
war
 
<EOS>
I
remain
fettered
on
the
poop
,
expose
to
the
enemy
's
shot
,
and
grow
delirious
with
fear
 
be
comfort
after
the
battle
by
Morgan
,
who
speak
freely
of
the
captain
;
be
over
-
hear
by
the
centinel
,
who
inform
against
him
,
and
again
imprison
 
Thomson
grow
desperate
,
and
notwithstanding
the
remonstrance
of
Morgan
and
me
,
go
over
-
board
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
the
storm
subside
into
a
brisk
gale
,
that
carry
us
into
the
warm
latitude
,
where
the
weather
become
intolerable
and
the
crew
very
sickly
.
     
<EOS>
the
doctor
leave
nothing
unattempted
towards
the
completion
of
his
vengeance
against
the
Welchman
and
me
.
<EOS>
He
go
among
the
sick
under
pretence
of
enquire
into
their
grievance
,
with
a
view
of
pick
up
complaint
to
our
prejudice
;
but
find
himself
frustrate
in
that
expectation
,
by
the
good
-
will
we
have
procure
from
the
patient
by
our
diligence
and
humanity
,
he
take
the
resolution
of
listen
to
our
conversation
,
by
hide
himself
behind
the
canvas
that
surround
our
birth
;
here
too
he
be
detect
by
the
boy
of
our
mess
,
who
acquaint
us
with
this
piece
of
behaviour
,
and
one
night
,
while
we
be
pick
a
large
bone
of
salt
-
beef
,
Morgan
discern
something
stir
against
our
hanging
,
which
immediately
interpret
to
be
the
doctor
,
he
tipt
me
the
wink
,
and
point
to
the
place
,
where
I
could
evidently
perceive
some
body
stand
;
upon
which
,
I
snatch
up
the
bone
,
and
level
it
with
all
my
force
at
him
,
say
,
"
whoever
you
be
,
take
that
for
your
curiosity
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
have
the
desire
effect
,
for
we
hear
the
listener
tumble
down
,
and
afterwards
crawl
to
his
own
cabbin
.
 
<EOS>
I
applaud
myself
much
for
this
feat
,
which
turn
out
one
of
the
most
unlucky
exploit
of
my
life
,
Mackshane
from
that
night
mark
me
out
for
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
about
a
week
thereafter
,
as
I
be
go
my
round
among
the
sick
,
I
be
take
prisoner
,
and
carry
to
the
poop
by
the
master
at
arm
,
where
I
be
load
with
iron
,
and
staple
to
the
deck
,
on
pretence
that
I
be
a
spy
on
board
,
and
have
conspire
against
the
captain
's
life
.
     
<EOS>
how
ridiculous
soever
this
imputation
be
,
I
do
not
fail
to
suffer
by
it
all
the
rigour
that
could
be
shew
to
the
bad
of
criminal
,
be
expose
in
this
miserable
condition
to
the
scorching
heat
of
the
sun
by
day
,
and
the
unwholesome
damp
by
night
,
during
the
space
of
twelve
day
,
in
which
time
I
be
neither
bring
to
trial
,
nor
examine
touch
the
probability
of
my
charge
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
recover
the
use
of
my
reflection
,
which
have
be
quite
overthrow
by
this
accident
,
than
I
send
for
Thomson
,
who
,
after
condole
with
me
on
the
occasion
,
hint
to
me
,
that
I
owe
this
misfortune
to
the
hatred
of
the
doctor
,
who
have
give
in
an
information
against
me
to
the
captain
,
in
consequence
of
which
I
be
arrest
,
and
all
my
paper
seize
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
curse
my
capricious
fate
,
I
see
Morgan
ascend
the
poop
,
guard
by
two
corporal
,
who
make
him
sit
down
by
me
,
that
he
may
be
pinion
in
the
same
machine
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
my
situation
,
I
could
scarce
refrain
from
laugh
at
the
countenance
of
my
fellow
prisoner
,
who
,
without
speak
one
word
,
allow
his
foot
to
be
inclose
in
the
ring
provide
for
that
purpose
;
but
when
they
pretend
to
fasten
him
on
his
back
,
he
grow
outragious
,
and
draw
a
large
cuteau
from
his
side
-
pocket
,
threaten
to
rip
up
the
belly
of
the
first
man
who
should
approach
him
,
in
order
to
treat
him
in
such
an
unworthy
manner
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
prepare
to
use
him
very
roughly
,
when
the
lieutenant
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
call
up
to
them
to
let
him
remain
as
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
creep
towards
me
,
and
take
me
by
the
hand
,
bid
me
"
put
my
trust
in
Got
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
look
at
Thomson
,
who
sit
by
us
tremble
,
with
a
pale
visage
,
tell
him
,
there
be
two
more
ring
for
his
foot
,
and
he
should
be
glad
to
find
him
in
such
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
the
intention
of
our
adversary
to
include
the
second
mate
in
our
fate
:
    
Him
<EOS>
he
except
to
be
his
drudge
in
attend
the
sick
,
and
if
possible
,
his
evidence
against
us
:
with
this
view
he
found
him
afar
off
,
but
find
his
integrity
incorruptible
,
he
harrasse
him
so
much
out
of
spite
,
that
in
a
short
time
this
mild
creature
grow
weary
of
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
and
my
fellow
-
prisoner
comfort
each
other
in
our
tribulation
,
the
admiral
discover
four
sail
of
ship
to
leeward
,
and
make
signal
for
our
ship
and
four
more
to
chace
:
Hereupon
,
every
thing
be
clear
for
an
engagement
,
and
Mackshane
foreseeing
he
would
have
occasion
for
more
assistant
than
one
,
obtain
Morgan
's
liberty
;
while
I
be
leave
in
this
deplorable
posture
to
the
chance
of
battle
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
almost
dark
when
we
come
up
with
the
sternmost
chace
,
which
we
hail
,
and
enquire
who
they
be
;
they
give
us
to
understand
they
be
french
man
of
war
,
upon
which
captain
Oakhum
command
them
to
send
their
boat
on
board
of
him
;
but
they
refuse
,
tell
him
,
if
he
have
any
business
with
them
,
to
come
on
board
of
their
ship
:
<EOS>
He
then
threatne
to
pour
in
a
broad
-
side
upon
them
,
which
they
promise
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
both
side
be
as
good
as
their
word
,
and
the
engagement
begin
with
great
fury
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
may
guess
how
I
pass
my
time
,
lie
in
this
helpless
situation
,
amidst
the
terror
of
a
sea
-
fight
;
expect
every
moment
to
be
cut
asunder
or
dash
in
piece
by
the
enemy
's
shot
!
    
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
compose
myself
as
much
as
possible
,
by
reflect
that
I
be
not
a
whit
more
expose
than
those
who
be
station
about
me
;
but
when
I
beheld
them
employ
without
intermission
,
in
annoy
the
foe
,
and
encourage
by
the
society
and
behaviour
of
one
another
,
I
could
easily
perceive
a
wide
difference
between
their
condition
and
mine
:
<EOS>
however
,
I
conceal
my
agitation
as
well
as
I
could
,
till
the
head
of
the
officer
of
Marines
,
who
stand
near
me
,
be
shoot
off
,
bounce
from
the
deck
athwart
my
face
,
leave
me
well
-
night
blind
with
brain
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
contain
myself
no
longer
,
but
begin
to
bellow
with
all
the
strength
of
my
lung
;
when
a
drummer
come
towards
me
,
ask
if
I
be
wound
;
and
before
I
could
answer
,
receive
a
great
shot
in
his
belly
which
tear
out
his
intrail
,
and
he
fall
flat
on
my
breast
.
 
<EOS>
this
accident
entirely
bereft
me
of
all
discretion
:
I
redouble
my
cry
,
which
be
drown
in
the
noise
of
the
battle
;
and
find
myself
disregard
,
lose
all
patience
and
become
frantick
;
vent
my
rage
in
oath
and
execration
,
till
my
spirit
be
quite
exhausted
,
I
remain
quiet
and
insensible
of
the
load
that
oppress
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
engagement
last
till
broad
day
,
when
captain
Oakhum
,
find
he
be
like
to
gain
neither
honour
nor
advantage
by
the
affair
,
pretend
to
be
undeceive
by
see
their
colour
;
and
hail
the
ship
with
whom
he
have
fight
all
night
,
protest
he
believe
them
Spaniards
,
and
the
gun
be
silence
on

side
,
order
the
barge
to
be
hoist
out
,
and
go
on
board
of
the

commodore
.
 
<EOS>
Our
loss
amount
to
ten
kill
and
eighteen
wound
,
most
part
of
whom
afterwards
die
.
 
<EOS>
My
fellow
-
mate
have
no
sooner
dispatch
their
business
in
the
cockpit
,
than
full
of
friendly
concern
,
they
come
to
visit
me
.
     
<EOS>
Morgan
ascend
first
,
and
see
my
face
almost
cover
with
brain
and
blood
,
conclude
I
be
no
longer
a
man
for
this
world
;
and
call
to
Thomson
with
great
emotion
,
bid
him
come
up
and
take
his
last
farewel
of
his
comrade
and
countryman
,
who
be
post
to
a
petter
place
,
where
there
be
no
Mackshanes
nor
oakhum
to
asperse
and
torment
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
(
say
he
,
take
me
by
the
hand
)
<EOS>
you
be
go
to
a
country
where
there
be
more
respect
shew
to
unfortunate
shentleman
,
and
where
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
peholde
your
adversary
toffe
upon
pillow
of
purne
primstone
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thomson
alarm
at
this
apostrophe
,
make
haste
to
the
place
where
I
lay
,
and
sit
down
by
me
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
enquire
into
the
nature
of
my
calamity
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
have
recollect
myself
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
converse
rationally
with
my
friend
,
whom
,
to
their
great
satisfaction
,
I
immediately
undeceive
with
regard
to
their
apprehension
of
my
being
mortally
wound
.
 
<EOS>
after
I
have
get
myself
disengage
from
the
carnage
in
which
I
wallow
,
and
partake
of
a
refreshment
which
my
friend
bring
along
with
them
,
we
enter
into
discourse
upon
the
hardship
we
sustain
,
and
speak
very
freely
of
the
author
of
our
misery
;
which
be
over
-
hear
by
the
centinel
who
guard
me
,
he
be
no
sooner
relieved
,
than
he
report
to
the
captain
every
syllable
of
our
conversation
,
accord
to
the
order
he
have
receive
:
the
effect
of
this
soon
appear
in
the
arrival
of
the
master
at
arm
,
who
replace
Morgan
in
his
former
station
;
and
give
the
second
mate
a
caution
to
keep
a
strict
guard
over
his
tongue
,
if
he
do
not
chuse
to
accompany
us
in
our
confinement
.
     
<EOS>
Thomson
foresee
that
the
whole
slavery
of
attend
and
dress
the
sick
and
wounded
,
must
now
fall
upon
his
shoulder
,
as
well
as
the
ill
usage
of
Mackshane
,
grow
desperate
at
the
prospect
,
and
though
I
never
hear
him
swear
before
,
imprecate
dreadful
curse
on
the
head
of
his
oppressor
,
declare
,
that
he
would
rather
quit
life
altogether
,
than
be
much
long
under
the
power
of
such
barbarian
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
little
startled
at
his
vivacity
,
and
endeavour
to
alleviate
his
complaint
,
by
represent
the
subject
of
my
own
,
with
as
much
aggravation
as
it
would
bear
,
by
which
comparison
he
may
see
the
balance
of
misfortune
lie
on
my
side
,
and
take
an
example
from
me
of
fortitude
and
submission
,
till
such
time
as
we
could
procure
redress
,
which
(
I
hope
)
be
not
far
off
,
consider
,
that
we
should
probably
be
in
a
harbour
in
less
than
three
day
,
where
we
should
have
an
opportunity
of
prefer
our
complaint
to
the
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
the
Welchman
join
in
my
remonstrance
,
and
be
at
great
pain
to
demonstrate
,
that
it
be
every
man
's
duty
as
well
as
interest
to
resign
himself
to
the
divine
will
,
and
look
upon
himself
as
a
centinel
upon
duty
,
who
be
by
no
mean
at
liberty
to
leave
his
post
before
he
be
relieved
.
 
<EOS>
Thomson
listen
attentively
to
what
we
say
,
and
at
last
,
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
shake
his
head
,
and
leave
us
,
without
make
any
reply
.
 
<EOS>
about
eleven
at
night
,
he
come
to
see
us
again
,
with
a
settled
gloom
on
his
countenance
,
and
give
us
to
understand
,
that
he
have
undergo
excessive
toil
since
he
see
us
,
and
in
recompence
,
have
be
grosly
abuse
by
the
doctor
,
who
tax
him
with
be
confederate
with
us
,
in
a
design
of
take
away
his
life
and
that
of
the
captain
.
    
<EOS>
after
some
time
spend
in
mutual
exhortation
,
he
get
up
,
and
squeeze
me
by
the
hand
with
an
uncommon
fervour
,
cry
,
"
God
bless
you
both
,
"
and
leave
us
to
wonder
at
his
singular
manner
of
part
with
us
,
which
do
not
fail
to
make
an
impression
on
us
both
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
when
the
hour
of
visitation
come
round
,
this
unhappy
young
man
be
a
missing
,
and
after
strick
search
,
suppose
to
have
go
over
-
board
in
the
night
;
which
be
certainly
the
case
.

chapter
XXX
<EOS>
We
lament
over
the
fate
of
our
companion
 
<EOS>
the
captain
offer
Morgan
his
liberty
,
which
he
refuse
to
accept
 
<EOS>
we
be
bring
before
him
and
examine
 
Morgan
be
send
back
to
custody
,
whither
<EOS>
also
I
be
remand
after
a
curious
trial
.
  
<EOS>
the
news
of
this
event
affect
my
fellow
-
prisoner
and
me
extremely
,
as
our
unfortunate
companion
have
justly
acquire
by
his
amiable
disposition
,
the
love
and
esteem
of
us
both
;
and
the
more
we
regret
his
untimely
fate
,
the
great
horror
we
conceive
for
the
villain
who
be
undoubtedly
the
occasion
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
abandon
miscreant
do
not
discover
the
least
symptom
of
concern
for
Thomson
's
death
,
although
he
must
be
conscious
to
himself
,
of
have
drive
him
by
ill
usage
to
that
fatal
resolution
;
but
desire
the
captain
to
set
Morgan
at
liberty
again
to
look
after
the
patient
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
one
of
the
corporal
be
send
up
to
unfetter
him
;
when
he
protest
he
would
not
be
release
until
he
should
know
for
what
he
be
confine
;
nor
would
he
be
a
tennis
-
ball
,
nor
a
shittle
-
cock
,
nor
a
trudge
,
nor
a
scullion
to
any
captain
under
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
oakhum
find
him
obstinate
,
and
fear
it
would
not
be
in
his
power
to
exercise
his
tyranny
much
longer
with
impunity
,
be
willing
to
shew
some
appearance
of
justice
,
and
therefore
order
us
both
to
be
bring
before
him
,
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
where
he
sit
in
state
,
with
his
clerk
on
one
side
,
and
his
counsellor
Mackshane
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
approach
,
he
honour
us
with
this
salutation
:
"
<EOS>
so
,
gentleman
,
d####n
my
blood
!
<EOS>
many
a
captain
in
the
navy
would
have
order
you
both
to
be
tuck
up
to
the
yard
's
arm
,
without
either
judge
or
jury
,
for
the
crime
you
have
be
guilty
of
;
but
d####n
my
blood
,
I
have
too
much
good
nature
,
in
allow
such
dog
as
you
to
make
your
defence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Captain
Oaghum
,
(
say
my
fellow
-
sufferer
)
<EOS>
certainly
it
be
in
your
power
<EOS>
(
Got
help
the
while
)
to
tuck
us
all
up
at
your
will
,
and
desire
,
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
and
perhaps
it
would
be
petter
for
some
of
us
to
be
tuck
up
,
than
undergo
the
misery
to
which
we
have
be
expose
.
 
<EOS>
so
may
the
farmer
hang
his
kid
for
his
diversion
,
and
amusement
,
and
mirth
;
but
there
be
such
a
thing
as
justice
,
if
not
upon
earth
,
surely
in
heaven
,
that
will
punish
with
fire
and
primstone
all
those
who
take
away
the
life
of
innocent
people
out
of
wantonness
and
parparity
<EOS>
(
look
you
.
)
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
know
the
crime
lay
to
my
charge
,
and
see
the
person
who
accuse
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
you
shall
(
say
the
captain
)
<EOS>
here
doctor
,
what
have
you
to
say
?
"
    
<EOS>
Mackshane
step
forward
,
hem
a
good
while
,
in
order
to
clear
his
throat
,
and
before
he
begin
,
Morgan
accost
him
thus
:
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Mackshane
,
look
in
my
face
 
look
in
the
face
of
an
honest
man
,
who
abhorr
a
false
-
witness
as
he
abhorr
the
tevil
,
and
Got
be
judge
between
you
and
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
not
mind
this
conjuration
,
make
the
follow
speech
,
as
near
as
I
can
remember
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Mr
Morgan
,
to
be
sure
what
you
say
be
just
,
in
regard
to
an
honest
man
;
and
if
so
be
it
appear
as
how
you
be
an
honest
man
,
then
it
be
my
opinion
,
that
you
deserve
to
be
acquit
,
in
relation
to
that
there
affair
;
for
I
tell
you
what
,
captain
Oakhum
be
resolve
for
to
do
every
body
justice
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
all
that
I
have
to
alledge
,
be
that
I
have
be
inform
,
you
have
speak
disrespectful
word
against
your
captain
,
who
to
be
sure
,
be
the
most
honourable
and
generous
commander
in
the
king
's
service
,
without
asparagement
or
acceptation
of
man
,
woman
or
child
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
have
utter
this
elegant
harrangue
,
on
which
he
seem
to
plume
himself
,
Morgan
reply
,
"
I
do
partly
guess
,
and
conceive
,
and
understand
your
meaning
,
which
I
wish
could
be
more
explicite
:
<EOS>
but
however
,
I
do
suppose
,
I
be
not
to
be
condemn
upon
bare
hear
-
say
;
or
if
I
be
convict
of
speak
disrespectfully
of
captain
Oakhum
,
I
hope
there
be
no
treason
in
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
mutiny
,
by
G
-
d
,
and
that
be
death
by
the
article
of
war
<EOS>
(
cry
Oakhum
.
)
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
let
the
witness
be
call
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
Mackshane
's
servant
appear
,
and
the
boy
of
our
mess
,
whom
they
have
seduce
and
tutor
for
the
purpose
.
     
<EOS>
the
first
declare
,
that
Morgan
,
as
he
descend
the
cockpit
ladder
,
one
day
,
curse
the
captain
and
call
him
a
savage
beast
,
say
,
he
ought
to
be
hunt
down
as
an
enemy
to
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
(
say
the
clerk
)
be
a
strong
presumption
of
a
design
form
against
the
captain
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
for
why
?
<EOS>
It
presuppose
malice
afore
-
think
,
and
a
criminal
intention
a
priori
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
right
(
say
the
captain
to
this
miserable
grub
,
who
have
be
an
attorney
's
boy
)
<EOS>
you
shall
have
law
enough
,
here
be
Cook
and
Littlejohn
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
evidence
be
confirm
by
the
boy
,
who
affirm
,
he
hear
the
first
mate
say
,
that
the
captain
have
no
more
bowel
than
a
bear
,
and
the
surgeon
have
no
more
brain
than
an
ass
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
centinel
who
hear
our
discourse
on
the
poop
be
examine
,
and
inform
the
court
that
the
Welchman
assure
me
,
that
captain
Oakhum
and
doctor
Mackshane
would
toss
upon
billow
of
burn
brimstone
in
hell
for
their
barbarity
.
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
observe
,
that
here
be
an
evident
prejudication
,
which
confirm
the
former
suspicion
of
a
conspiracy
against
the
life
of
captain
Oakhum
;
for
,
because
,
how
could
Morgan
so
positively
pronounce
that
the
captain
and
surgeon
would
be
damn
,
unless
he
have
intention
to
make
away
with
them
before
they
could
have
time
to
repent
?
 
<EOS>
this
sage
explanation
have
great
weight
with
our
noble
commander
,
who
exclaim
,
"
what
have
you
to
say
to
this
,
Taffy
?
<EOS>
you
seem
to
be
take
all
a
-
back
,
brother
,
hah
!
"
 
<EOS>
Morgan
be
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
disown
the
text
,
although
he
absolutely
deny
the
truth
of
the
comment
:
    
<EOS>
upon
which
the
captain
,
strut
up
to
him
,
with
a
ferocious
countenance
,
say
,
"
so
,
Mr
Son
-
of
-
a
-
b####ch
,
you
confess
you
honour
me
with
the
name
of
bear
and
beast
,
and
pronounce
my
damnation
!
<EOS>
D####n
<EOS>
my
heart
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
have
you
bring
to
a
court
-
martial
and
hang
,
you
dog
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
here
Mackshane
have
occasion
for
an
assistant
,
interpose
,
and
beg
the
captain
to
pardon
Mr
Morgan
,
with
his
wonted
goodness
,
upon
condition
that
he
the
delinquent
should
make
such
submission
as
the
nature
of
his
misdemeanour
demand
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
the
Cambro
-
Briton
,
who
on
this
occasion
,
would
have
make
no
submission
to
the
Great
Mogul
,
surround
with
his
guard
,
thank
the
doctor
for
his
mediation
,
and
acknowledge
himself
in
the
wrong
for
have
call
the
image
of
Got
,
a
beast
,
"
but
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
speak
by
metaphor
,
and
parable
,
and
comparison
,
and
type
;
as
we
signify
meekness
by
a
lamb
,
letchery
by
a
goat
,
and
craftiness
by
a
fox
;
so
we
liken
ignorance
to
an
ass
,
and
brutality
to
a
bear
,
and
fury
to
a
tyger
;
 
therefore
I
make
these
similie
to
express
my
sentiment
<EOS>
(
look
you
)
and
what
I
say
,
before
Got
,
I
will
not
unsay
before
man
nor
peast
neither
.
"
 
<EOS>
Oakhum
be
so
provoke
at
this
insolence
(
as
he
term
it
)
that
he
order
him
forthwith
to
be
carry
to
the
place
of
his
confinement
,
and
his
clerk
to
proceed
in
the
examination
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
question
put
to
me
,
be
touch
the
place
of
my
nativity
,
which
I
declare
to
be
the
north
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
the
north
of
Ireland
more
liker
(
cry
the
captain
)
but
we
shall
bring
you
up
presently
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
ask
what
religion
I
profess
;
and
when
I
answer
,
"
the
protestant
,
"
swore
I
be
as
arrant
a
Roman
as
ever
go
to
mass
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
clerk
(
continue
he
)
catechise
him
a
little
on
this
subject
.
"
     
<EOS>
but
before
I
relate
the
particular
of
the
clerk
's
enquiry
,
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
inform
the
reader
that
our
commander
himself
be
an
Hibernian
,
and
,
if
not
shrewdly
belie
,
a
Roman
Catholick
to
boot
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
you
be
a
protestant
(
say
the
clerk
)
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
your
finger
,
so
,
and
swear
upon
it
,
to
that
affirmation
.
<EOS>
"
 
when
I
be
about
to
perform
this
ceremony
,
the
captain
cry
with
some
emotion
,
"
no
,
no
,
damme
!
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
profanation
neither
.
 
<EOS>
but
go
on
with
your
interrogation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
then
(
proceed
my
examiner
)
how
many
sacrament
be
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
to
which
I
reply
,
"
two
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
they
?
<EOS>
(
say
he
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
"
baptism
and
the
Lord
's
Supper
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
so
you
would
explode
confirmation
and
marriage
altogether
?
<EOS>
(
say
Oakhum
)
<EOS>
I
think
this
fellow
be
a
rank
Roman
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
,
though
he
be
breed
under
an
attorney
,
could
not
refrain
from
blush
at
this
blunder
,
which
he
endeavour
to
conceal
,
by
observe
,
that
these
decoy
would
not
do
with
me
who
seem
to
be
an
old
offender
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
on
,
with
ask
if
I
believe
in
transubstantiation
;
but
I
treat
the
notion
of
the
real
presence
with
such
disrespect
that
his
patron
be
scandalize
at
my
impiety
,
and
command
him
to
proceed
to
the
plot
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
this
miserable
pettifogger
tell
me
,
there
be
great
reason
to
suspect
me
of
be
a
spy
on
board
;
and
that
I
have
enter
into
a
conspiracy
with
Thomson
and
other
not
yet
detect
,
against
the
life
of
captain
Oakhum
.
     
<EOS>
to
support
which
accusation
;
they
adduce
the
testimony
of
our
boy
,
who
declare
he
have
often
hear
the
deceased
Thomson
and
me
whisper
together
,
and
could
distinguish
the
word
,
"
oakhum
,
rascal
,
poison
,
pistol
,
"
by
which
it
appear
,
we
do
intend
to
use
sinister
mean
to
accomplish
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
that
the
death
of
Thomson
seem
to
confirm
this
conjecture
,
who
,
either
feel
the
sting
of
remorse
,
for
be
engage
in
such
a
horrid
confederacy
,
or
fear
a
discovery
,
by
which
he
must
have
infallibly
suffer
an
ignominious
death
,
have
put
a
fatal
period
to
his
own
existence
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
establish
the
truth
of
the
whole
,
be
a
book
in
cypher
find
among
my
paper
,
which
exactly
tally
with
one
find
in
his
chest
,
after
his
disappearance
:
<EOS>
this
,
he
observe
,
be
a
presumption
very
near
proof
positive
,
and
would
determine
any
jury
in
christendom
to
find
me
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
own
defence
,
I
alledge
that
I
have
be
drag
on
board
at
first
very
much
against
my
inclination
,
as
I
could
prove
by
the
evidence
of
some
people
now
in
the
ship
;
consequently
could
have
no
design
of
become
spy
at
that
time
;
and
ever
since
have
be
entirely
out
of
the
reach
of
any
correspondence
that
could
justly
intail
that
suspicion
upon
me
;
 
and
as
for
conspire
against
my
captain
's
life
,
it
could
not
be
suppose
that
any
man
in
his
right
wit
would
harbour
the
least
thought
of
such
an
undertaking
,
which
he
could
not
possibly
perform
without
certain
infamy
and
ruin
to
himself
,
even
if
he
have
all
the
inclination
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
that
allow
the
boy
's
evidence
to
be
true
(
which
I
affirm
be
false
and
malicious
)
<EOS>
nothing
conclusive
could
be
gather
from
a
few
incoherent
word
:
<EOS>
neither
be
the
fate
of
Mr
Thomson
a
circumstance
more
favourable
for
the
charge
;
for
I
have
in
my
pocket
,
a
letter
which
too
well
explain
that
mystery
,
in
a
very
different
manner
from
that
which
be
suppose
:
    
with
these
word
I
produce
the
following
letter
,
which
Jack
Rattlin
bring
to
me
the
very
day
after
Thomson
disappear
;
and
tell
me
it
be
commit
to
his
care
by
the
deceased
,
who
make
him
promise
not
to
deliver
it
sooner
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
take
it
out
of
my
hand
,
read
aloud
the
content
,
which
be
these
:
    
Dear
Friend
,
"
 
I
be
so
much
oppress
with
the
fatigue
I
daily
and
nightly
undergo
,
and
the
barbarous
usage
of
doctor
Mackshane
,
who
be
bent
on
your
destruction
,
as
well
as
mine
,
that
I
be
resolve
to
free
myself
from
this
miserable
life
,
and
before
you
receive
this
,
shall
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
wish
to
die
in
your
good
opinion
,
which
I
be
afraid
I
shall
forfeit
by
the
last
act
of
my
life
;
but
if
you
can
not
acquit
me
,
I
know
you
will
at
least
preserve
some
regard
for
the
memory
of
an
unfortunate
young
man
who
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
recommend
it
to
you
,
to
beware
of
Mackshane
,
whose
revenge
be
implacable
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
all
prosperity
to
you
and
Mr
Morgan
,
to
whom
pray
offer
my
last
respect
,
and
beg
to
be
remember
as
your
unhappy
friend
and
countryman
.
"
<EOS>
William
Thomson
,
"
    
this
letter
be
no
sooner
read
,
than
Mackshane
,
in
a
transport
of
rage
,
snatch
it
out
of
the
clerk
's
hand
,
and
tear
it
into
a
thousand
piece
,
say
,
it
be
a
villainous
forgery
,
contrive
and
execute
by
myself
.
     
<EOS>
the
captain
and
clerk
declare
themselves
of
the
same
opinion
,
notwithstanding
I
insist
on
have
the
remain
of
it
compare
to
other
writing
of
Thomson
,
which
they
have
in
possession
;
and
I
be
order
to
answer
the
last
article
of
my
accusation
,
namely
,
the
book
of
cypher
find
among
my
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
easily
do
(
say
I.
)
<EOS>
what
you
be
pleased
to
call
cypher
,
be
no
other
than
the
greek
character
,
in
which
,
for
my
amusement
,
I
keep
a
diary
of
every
thing
remarkable
that
have
occur
to
my
observation
since
the
beginning
of
the
voyage
,
till
the
day
on
which
I
be
put
in
iron
;

the

method

be
practise
by
Mr
Thomson
who
copy
mine

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
very
likely
story
!
<EOS>
(
cry
Mackshane
)
<EOS>
what
occasion
be
there
for
use
greek
character
,
if
you
be
not
afraid
of
discover
what
you
have
write
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
<EOS>
what
d'ye
talk
of
greek
character
?
 
<EOS>
d'ye
think
I
be
so
ignorant
of
the
greek
language
,
as
not
to
distinguish
its
letter
from
these
,
which
be
no
more
greek
than
chinese
?
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
I
will
not
give
up
my
knowledge
of
the
Greek
for
you
,
nor
none
that
ever
come
from
your
country
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
with
an
unparalleled
effronterie
,
he
repeat
some
gibberish
,
which
by
the
sound
seem
to
be
irish
,
and
make
it
pass
for
Greek
with
the
captain
,
who
look
at
me
with
a
contemptible
sneer
,
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
ah
ha
!
<EOS>
have
you
catch
a
tartar
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
help
smile
at
the
consummate
assurance
of
this
Hibernian
,
and
offer
to
refer
the
dispute
to
any
body
on
board
,
who
understand
the
greek
alphabet
:
    
upon
which
Morgan
be
bring
back
,
and
be
make
acquainted
with
the
affair
,
take
the
book
and
read
a
whole
page
in
English
,
without
hesitation
,
decide
the
controversy
in
my
favour
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
so
far
from
be
out
of
countenance
at
this
,
that
he
affirm
Morgan
be
in
the
secret
,
and
repeat
from
his
own
invention
.
 
<EOS>
Oakhum
say
,
"
ay
,
ay
,
I
see
they
be
both
in
a
story
,
"
and
dismiss
my
fellow
-
mate
to
his
cock
-
loft
,
although
I
propose
that
he
and
I
should
read
and
translate
separately
,
any
chapter
or
verse
in
the
Greek
-
testament
in
his
possession
,
by
which
it
would
appear
whether
we
or
the
surgeon
speak
truth
.
 
<EOS>
not
be
endue
with
eloquence
enough
to
convince
the
captain
that
there
could
be
no
juggle
nor
confederacy
in
this
expedient
,
I
beg
to
be
examine
by
some
unconcerned
person
on
board
,
who
understand
Greek
:
<EOS>
accordingly
the
whole
ship
's
company
,
officer
and
all
,
be
call
upon
deck
,
among
whom
it
be
proclaim
,
that
if
any
of
them
could
speak
Greek
,
he
or
they
so
qualified
,
should
ascend
the
quarter
-
deck
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
pause
two
fore
-
mast
-
man
come
up
and
profess
their
skill
in
that
language
,
which
(
they
say
)
<EOS>
they
acquire
during
several
voyage
to
the
Levant
,
among
the
Greeks
of
the
Morea
.
<EOS>
the
captain
exult
much
in
this
declaration
,
and
put
my
journal
-
book
into
the
hand
of
one
of
them
,
who
candidly
own
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
;
the
other
acknowledge
the
same
degree
of
ignorance
,
but
pretend
to
speak
the
greek
lingo
with
any
man
on
board
;
and
address
himself
to
me
,
pronounce
some
sentence
of
a
barbarous
corrupt
language
,
which
I
do
not
understand
.
     
<EOS>
I
assert
that
the
modern
Greek
be
as
different
from
that
speak
and
write
by
the
ancient
,
as
the
English
use
now
from
the
old
Saxon
<EOS>
speak
in
the
time
of
Hengist
;
and
as
I
have
only
learn
the
true
original
tongue
,
in
which
Homer
,
Pindar
,
the
evangelist
and
other
great
man
of
antiquity
write
,
it
could
not
be
suppose
that
I
should
know
any
thing
of
an
imperfect
gothic
dialect
that
rise
on
the
ruin
of
the
former
,
and
scarce
retain
any
trace
of
the
old
expression
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
doctor
Mackshane
,
who
pretend
to
be
master
of
the
greek
language
,
could
maintain
a
conversation
with
these
seaman
,
I
would
retract
what
I
have
say
,
and
be
content
to
suffer
any
punishment
he
should
think
proper
to
inflict
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
utter
these
word
,
than
the
surgeon
know
one
of
the
fellow
to
be
his
countryman
,
accost
him
in
Irish
,
and
be
answer
in
the
same
brogue
;
then
a
dialogue
ensue
between
them
,
which
they
affirm
to
be
Greek
,
after
have
secure
the
secrecy
of
the
other
tar
,
who
have
his
cue
in
the
language
of
the
Morea
from
his
companion
,
before
they
would
venture
to
assert
such
an
intrepid
falshood
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
(
say
Oakhum
)
<EOS>
we
should
discover
the
imposture
at
last
,
 
<EOS>
let
the
rascal
be
carry
back
to
his
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
must
dangle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
have
nothing
further
to
urge
in
my
own
behalf
,
before
a
court
so
prejudice
with
spite
,
and
fortify
with
ignorance
against
truth
,
I
suffer
myself
to
be
reconducte
peaceably
to
my
fellow
-
prisoner
,
who
hear
the
particular
of
my
trial
,
lift
up
his
hand
and
eye
to
heaven
,
and
utter
a
dreadful
groan
;
and
not
daring
to
disburthen
his
thought
to
me
by
speech
,
lest
he
may
be
overhear
by
the
centinel
,
burst
forth
into
a
Welch
song
,
which
he
accompany
with
a
thousand
contortion
of
face
and
violent
gesture
of
body
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
<EOS>
I
discover
a
subornation
against
me
,
by
mean
of
a
quarrel
between
two
of
the
evidence
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
I
be
set
at
liberty
,
and
prevail
upon
Morgan
to
accept
of
his
freedom
on
the
same
term
 
Mackshane
's
malice
 
we
arrive
at
Jamaica
,
from
whence
in
a
short
time
we
beat
up
to
Hispaniola
,
in
conjunction
with
the
West
-
indian
squadron
 
<EOS>
we
take
in
water
,
sail
again
,
and
arrive
at
Carthagena
 
reflection
on
our
conduct
there
.
  
<EOS>
mean
while
,
a
quarrel
happen
between
the
two
modern
Greeks
,
the
one
to
be
revenge
of
the
other
,
come
and
discover
to
us
the
mystery
of
Mackshane
's
dialogue
,
as
I
have
explain
it
above
.
<EOS>
this
detection
come
to
the
ear
of
the
doctor
,
who
be
sensible
that
(
now
we
be
in
sight
of
Jamaica
)
<EOS>
we
should
have
an
opportunity
of
clear
ourselves
before
a
court
-
martial
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
of
make
his
malice
and
ignorance
conspicuous
,
he
interceede
for
us
with
the
captain
so
effectually
,
that
in
a
few
hour
we
be
set
at
liberty
,
and
order
to
return
to
our
duty
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
happy
event
for
me
<EOS>
,
my
whole
body
be
blister
by
the
sun
,
and
my
limb
benumb
for
want
of
motion
:
    
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
persuade
the
Welchman
to
accept
of
this
indulgence
,
he
persist
in
his
obstinacy
to
remain
in
iron
until
he
should
be
discharge
by
a
court
-
martial
,
which
he
believe
would
also
do
him
justice
on
his
enemy
;
at
length
,
I
represent
to
him
the
precarious
issue
of
a
trial
,
the
power
and
interest
of
his
adversary
,
and
flatter
his
revenge
with
the
hope
of
wreak
his
resentment
with
his
own
hand
upon
Mackshane
after
our
return
to
England
:
<EOS>
this
last
argument
have
more
weight
with
him
than
all
the
rest
,
and
prevail
upon
him
to
repair
with
me
to
the
cockpit
,
which
I
no
sooner
enter
,
than
the
idea
of
my
depart
friend
present
itself
to
my
remembrance
,
and
fill
my
eye
with
tear
.
 
<EOS>
We
discharge
from
our
mess
the
boy
who
have
act
so
perfidiously
,
notwithstanding
his
tear
,
intreatie
,
and
profession
of
penitence
for
what
he
have
do
;
but
not
before
he
have
confess
that
the
surgeon
have
bribe
him
to
give
evidence
against
us
,
with
a
pair
of
stocking
and
a
couple
of
old
-
check
shirt
,
which
his
servant
have
since
plunder
him
of
.
    
<EOS>
the
key
of
our
chest
and
locker
be
send
to
us
by
the
doctor
<EOS>
,
we
detain
the
messenger
until
we
have
examine
the
content
;
and
my
fellow
-
mate
finding
all
his
Cheshire
cheese
consume
to
a
crust
,
his
brandy
exhaust
,
and
his
onion
go
,
be
seize
with
a
fit
of
choler
,
which
he
discharge
on
Mackshane
's
man
in
oath
and
execration
,
threatne
to
prosecute
him
as
a
thief
.
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
swear
in
his
turn
that
he
never
have
the
key
in
his
possession
till
that
time
,
when
he
receive
them
from

and
by
the
soul
of

<EOS>
I
will
impeach

and
accuse
,
and
indict
him
of
a
roppery
,
if
I
do
but
know
who
he
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
have
this
happen
at
sea
where
we
could
not
repair
the
loss
,
in
all
probability
,
this
descendant
of
Cadwallader
would
have
lose
his
wit
entirely
:
but
when
I
observe
,
how
easy
it
would
be
to
make
up
for
this
paultry
misfortune
,
he
become
more
calm
,
and
reconcile
himself
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
while
after
,
the
surgeon
come
into
the
birth
,
under
pretence
of
take
something
out
of
the
medicine
-
chest
,
and
with
a
smile
aspect
,
wish
us
joy
of
our
deliverance
,
which
(
he
say
)
<EOS>
he
have
be
at
great
pain
to
obtain
of
the
captain
,
who
be
very
justly
incensed
at
our
behaviour
;
but
he
(
the
doctor
)
have
pass
his
word
for
our
conduct
in
time
to
come
,
and
he
hope
we
should
give
him
no
cause
to
repent
of
his
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
He
expect
(
no
doubt
)
an
acknowledgment
from
us
for
this
pretended
piece
of
service
,
as
well
as
a
general
amnesty
of
what
be
past
;
but
he
have
to
do
with
people
who
be
not
quite
so
apt
to
forgive
injury
as
he
imagine
,
or
to
forget
that
if
our
deliverance
be
owe
to
his
mediation
,
our
calamity
be
occasion
by
his
malice
;
I
therefore
sit
silent
while
my
companion
answer
,
"
ay
,
ay
,
'
tis
no
matter
 
<EOS>
Got
know
the
heart
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
time
for
all
thing
,
as
the
wise
man
saith
,
there
be
a
time
for
throw
away
stone
,
and
a
time
to
gather
them
up
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
disconcert
at
this
reply
,
and
go
away
in
a
pet
,
mutter
something
about
"
Ingratitude
"
and
"
fellow
,
"
which
we
do
not
think
fit
to
take
any
notice
of
.
    
<EOS>
Our
fleet
have
join
another
that
wait
for
us
,
lie
at
anchor
about
a
month
in
the
harbour
of
Port
-
Royal
in
Jamaica
,
during
which
time
something
of
consequence
be
certainly
transact
,
notwithstanding
the
insinuation
of
some
who
affirm
<EOS>
we
have
no
business
at
all
in
that
place
 
<EOS>
that
in
order
to
take
the
advantage
of
the
season
proper
for
our
enterprize
,
the
west
-
indian
squadron
,
which
have
previous
notice
of
our
come
,
ought
to
have
join
us
at
the
west
end
of
Hispaniola
with
necessary
store
and
refreshment
,
from
whence
we
could
have
sail
directly
to
Carthagena
,
before
the
enemy
could
put
themselves
in
a
good
posture
of
defence
,
or
indeed
have
an
inkling
of
our
design
.
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
we
sail
from
Jamaica
,
and
in
ten
day
or
a
fortnight
,
beat
up
against
the
wind
as
far
as
the
isle
of
Vache
,
with
an
intention
,
as
be
say
,
to
attack
the
french
fleet
,
then
suppose
to
be
lie
near
that
place
;
but
before
we
arrive
they
have
sail
for
Europe
,
have
first
dispatch
an
advice
-
boat
to
Carthagena
with
an
account
of
our
being
in
these
sea
,
as
also
of
our
strength
and
destination
.
 
<EOS>
We
loiter
here
some
day
longer
,
take
in
wood
,
and
brackish
water
,
in
the
use
whereof
,
however
,
our
admiral
seem
to
consult
the
health
of
the
man
,
by
restrict
each
to
a
quart
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
we
set
sail
,
and
arrive
in
a
bay
to
the
windward
of
Carthagena
,
where
we
come
to
an
anchor
,
and
lie
at
our
ease
ten
day
longer
.
     
<EOS>
here
again
,
certain
malicious
people
take
occasion
to
blame
the
conduct
of
their
superior
,
by
say
,
this
be
not
only
throw
away
time
,
which
be
very
precious
consider
the
approach
of
the
rainy
season
,
but
also
give
the
Spaniards
time
to
recollect
themselves
,
and
recover
from
the
consternation
they
be
throw
into
at
the
approach
of
an
english
fleet
,
at
least
three
time
as
numerous
as
ever
appear
in
that
part
of
the
world
before
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
may
be
allow
to
give
my
opinion
of
the
matter
,
I
would
ascribe
this
delay
to
the
generosity
of
our
chief
,
who
scorn
to
take
any
advantage
that
fortune
may
give
them
,
even
over
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
we
weigh
,
and
anchor
again
somewhat
nearer
the
harbour
's
mouth
,
where
we
make
shift
to
land
our
marine
,
who
encamp
on
the
beach
,
in
despite
of
the
enemy
's
shot
,
which
knock
a
good
many
of
them
on
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
this
piece
of
conduct
in
chuse
a
camp
under
the
wall
of
an
enemy
's
fortification
,
which
I
believe
never
happen
before
,
be
practise
,
I
presume
,
with
a
view
of
accustom
the
soldier
to
stand
fire
,
who
be
not
as
yet
much
use
to
discipline
,
most
of
them
have
be
take
from
the
plough
-
tail
a
few
month
before
.
 
<EOS>
this
again
have
furnish
matter
for
censure
against
the
Ministry
,
for
send
a
few
raw
recruit
on
such
an
important
enterprize
,
while
so
many
veteran
regiment
lie
inactive
at
home
:
<EOS>
but
surely
our
governour
have
their
reason
for
so
do
,
which
possibly
may
be
disclose
with
other
secret
of
the
deep
.
<EOS>
perhaps
they
be
loth
to
risk
their
good
troop
on
such
desperate
service
;
or
,
may
be
the
colonel
and
field
officer
of
the
old
corp
,
who
,
generally
speak
,
enjoy
their
commission
as
fine
-
cure
or
pension
,
for
some
domestick
service
tender
to
the
court
,
refuse
to
embark
in
such
a
dangerous
and
precarious
undertaking
;
for
which
,
no
doubt
,
they
be
to
be
much
commend
.

of

<EOS>
Our
force
be
land
and
station
as
I
have
already
mention
,
set
about
erect
a
faschine
battery
to
cannonade
the
principal
fort
of
the
enemy
,
and
in
something
more
than
three
week
,
it
be
ready
to
open
.
<EOS>
that
we
may
do
the
Spaniards
as
much
honour
as
possible
,
it
be
determine
in
a
council
of
war
,
that
five
of
our
large
ship
should
attack
the
fort
on
one
side
,
while
the
battery
play
it
on
the
other
,
strengthen
with
two
mortar
,
and
twenty
-
four
co

horn
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
signal
for
our
ship
to
engage
,
among
other
,
be
hoist
,
we
be
advertise
the
night
before
,
to
make
every
thing
clear
for
that
purpose
:
and
in
so
do
,
a
difference
happen
between
captain
Oakhum
and
his
well
-
beloved
cousin
and
counsellor
Mackshane
,
which
have
well
nigh
terminate
in
an
open
rupture
.
     
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
who
have
imagine
there
be
no
more
danger
of
be
hurt
by
the
enemy
's
shot
in
the
cockpit
than
in
the
center
of
the
earth
,
be
lately
inform
that
a
surgeon
's
mate
have
be
kill
in
that
place
,
by
a
cannon
-
ball
from
two
small
fort
,
that
be
destroy
before
the
disembarkation
of
our
soldier
;
and
therefore
insist
upon
have
a
platform
raise
for
the
convenience
of
the
sick
and
wound
,
in
the
after
-
hold
,
where
he
deem
himself
more
secure
than
on
the
deck
above
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
,
offend
at
this
extraordinary
proposal
,
accuse
him
of
pusilanimity
,
and
tell
him
there
be
no
room
in
the
hold
for
such
an
occasion
;
or
if
there
be
,
he
could
not
expect
to
be
indulge
more
than
the
rest
of
the
surgeon
of
the
navy
,
who
use
the
cockpit
for
that
purpose
:
<EOS>
fear
render
Mackshane
obstinate
,
he
persist
in
his
demand
,
and
shew
his
instruction
,
by
which
it
be
authorise
:
<EOS>
the
captain
swear
these
instruction
be
dictate
by
a
parcel
of
lazy
poltroon
who
be
never
at
sea
;
but
be
oblige
to
comply
,
and
send
for
the
carpenter
to
give
him
order
about
it
:
<EOS>
but
before
any
such
measure
could
be
take
,
our
signal
be
throw
out
,
and
the
doctor
compel
to
trust
his
carcase
in
the
cockpit
,
where
Morgan
and
I
be
busy
in
put
our
instrument
and
dressing
in
order
.
    
<EOS>
Our
ship
,
with
the
other
destine
for
this
service
,
immediately
weigh
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
come
to
an
anchor
before
the
castle
of
Bocca
Chica
,
with
a
spring
upon
our
cable
.
 
<EOS>
the
cannonading
(
which
indeed
be
terrible

)
begin
.
    
<EOS>
the
surgeon
,
after
have
cross
himself
,
fall
flat
on
the
deck
;
and
the
chaplain
and
purser
,
who
be
station
with
us
,
in
quality
of
assistant

follow
his
example
,
while
the
Welchman

I
sit

look
at

another
with
great
discomposure

scarce
able

and
that

it
be
not
a

that
alarm
us
<EOS>
thus
,
I
must
inform
him
of
the
particular
of
this
dreadful
din
that
astonish
us

<EOS>
the

of
the

proceed
from

which
fire
without

.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
be
many
minute
<EOS>
engage
,
when
one
of
the
sailor
bring
another
on
his
back
to
the
cockpit
,
where
he
toss
him
down
like
a
bag
of
oats
,
and
pull
out
his
pouch
,
put
a
large
chew
of
tobacco
in
his

,
without
speak
a

;
Morgan
immediately
examine
the
condition
of
the
wounded
man

and
cry

"

the

dead

<EOS>
he
may

I

I

if

I
take
him
up

"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
be
about
to
return
to
his
quarter
,
when
I
bid
him
carry
the
body
along
with
him
and
throw
it
over
-
board
.
 
<EOS>
"
D####n
the
body
!
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
think
'
tis
fair
enough
if
I
take
care
of
my
own
.
"
     
<EOS>
My
fellow
-
mate
snatching
up
the
amputation
knife
,
pursue
him
half
-
way
up
the
cockpit
ladder
,
cry
,
"
You
lousy
rascal
,
be
this
the
church
-
yard
,
or
the
charnel
-
house
,
or
the
sepulchre
,
or
the
Golgotha
of
the
ship
?
"
 
but
be
stopt
in
his
carreer
by
one
calling
,
"
Yo
ho
,
avast
there
 
scalding
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
scalding
!
<EOS>
(
answer
Morgan
)
<EOS>
Got
know
'
tis
hot
enough
indeed
:
 
who
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
one
(
reply
the
voice
.
"
)
<EOS>
and
I
immediately
know
it
to
be
that
of
my
honest
friend
Jack
Rattlin
,
who
come
towards
me
,
tell
me
,
with
great
deliberation
,
he
be
come
to
be
dock'd
at
last
,
and
discover
the
remain
of
one
hand
which
have
be
shatter
to
piece
with
grape
shot
.
 
<EOS>
I
lament
with
unfeigned
sorrow
his
misfortune
,
which
he
bear
with
heroic
courage
,
observe
,
that
every
shot
have
its
commission
<EOS>
:
It
be
well
it
do
not
take
him
in
the
head
;
or
if
it
have
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
he
should
have
die
bravely
,
fight
for
his
king
and
country
:
death
be
a
debt
which
every
man
owe
,
and
must
pay
now
as
well
as
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
and
edify
with
the
maxim
of
this
sea
-
philosopher
,
who
endure
the
amputation
of
his
left
hand
without
shrink
<EOS>
;
the
operation
be
perform
(
at
his
request
)
by
me
,
after
Mackshane
,
who
be
with
difficulty
prevail
to
lift
his
head
from
the
deck
,
have
declare
there
be
a
necessity
for
his
lose
the
limb
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
employ
in
dress
the
stump
,
I
ask
Jack
's
opinion
of
the
battle
,
who
shake
his
head
,
frankly
tell
me
,
he
believe
we
should
do
no
good
:
    
"
<EOS>
for
why
,
because
instead
of
drop
anchor
close
under
shore
,
where
we
should
have
have
to
deal
with
one
corner
of
Bocca
Chica
only
,
we
have
open
the
harbour
,
and
expose
ourselves
to
the
whole
fire
of
the
enemy
from
their
shipping
and
fort
<EOS>
St
Joseph
,
as
well
as
from
the
castle
we
intend
to
canonade
;
that
besides
,
we
lie
at
too
great
a
distance
to
damage
the
wall
,
and
three
part
in
four
of
our
shot
do
not
take
place
;
for
there
be
scarce
any
body
on
board
,
who
understand
the
pointing
of
a
gun
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
God
help
us
!
<EOS>
(
continue
he
)
if
your
kinsman
lieutenant
Bowling
have
be
here
,
we
should
have
have
other
-
guess
-
work
.
"
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
our
patient
have
increase
to
such
a
degree
,
that
we
do
not
know
which
to
begin
with
;
and
the
first
mate
plainly
tell
the
surgeon
,
that
if
he
do
not
get
up
immediately
,
and
perform
his
duty
,
he
would
complain
of
his
behaviour
to
the
admiral
,
and
make
application
for
his
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
this
effectually
rouse
Mackshane
,
who
be
never
deaf
to
an
argument
in
which
he
think
his
interest
be
concern
;
he
therefore
rise
up
,
and
in
order
to
strengthen
his
resolution
,
have
recourse
more
than
once
to
a
case
-
bottle
of
rum
which
he
freely
communicate
to
the
chaplain
and
purser
,
who
have
as
much
need
of
such
extraordinary
inspiration
as
himself
:
be
thus
support
,
he
go
to
work
,
and
arm
and
leg
be
hew
down
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
the
fume
of
the
liquor
mount
into
the
parson
's
brain
,
conspire
with
his
former
agitation
of
spirit
,
to
make
him
quite
delirious
;
he
stript
himself
to
the
skin
,
and
besmear
his
body
with
blood
,
could
scarce
be
with
-
hold
from
run
upon
deck
in
that
condition
.
<EOS>
Jack
Rattlin
,
scandalize
at
this
deportment
,
endeavour
to
allay
his
transport
with
reason
;
but
find
all
he
say
ineffectual
,
and
great
confusion
occasion
by
his
frolick
,
he
knock
him
down
with
his
right
hand
,
and
by
threat
keep
him
quiet
in
that
state
of
humiliation
.
     
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
rum
to
elevate
the
purser
,
who
sit
on
the
floor
wring
his
hand
,
and
curse
the
hour
in
which
he
leave
his
peaceable
profession
of
a
brewer
in
Rochester
,
to
engage
in
such
a
life
of
terror
and
disquiet
.
 
<EOS>
while
we
divert
ourselves
at
the
expence
of
this
poor
devil
,
a
shot
happen
to
take
us
between
wind
and
water
,
and
its
course
be
through
the
purser
's
store
-
room
,
make
a
terrible
havock
and
noise
among
the
jar
and
bottle
in
its
way
,
and
disconcert
Mackshane
so
much
,
that
he
dropt
his
scalpel
,
and
fall
down
on
his
knee
,
pronounce
his
Pater
-
noster
aloud
;
the
purser
fall
backward
and
lie
without
sense
or
motion
;
and
the
chaplain
grow
,
so
outrageous
,
that
Rattlin
with
one
hand
,
could
not
keep
him
under
;
so
that
we
be
oblige
to
confine
him
in
the
surgeon
's
cabbin
,
where
he
be
no
doubt
guilty
of
a
thousand
extravagancy
.
 
<EOS>
much
about
this
time
,
my
old
antagonist
Crampley
come
down
,
with
express
order
(
as
he
say
)
to
bring
me
up
to
the
quarter
-
deck
,
to
dress
a
slight
wound
the
captain
have
receive
by
a
splinter
.
<EOS>
His
reason
for
honour
me
in
particular
with
this
piece
of
service
,
be
that
in
case
I
should
be
kill
or
disable
by
the
way
<EOS>
,
my
death
or
mutilation
would
be
of
less
consequence
to
the
ship
's
company
,
than
that
of
the
doctor
or
his
first
mate
.
 
<EOS>
at
another
time
,
perhaps
,
I
may
have
dispute
this
order
,
to
which
I
be
not
bind
to
pay
the
least
regard
;
but
as
I
think
my
reputation
depend
upon
my
compliance
,
I
be
resolve
to
convince
my
rival
that
I
be
no
more
afraid
than
he
,
to
expose
myself
to
danger
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
I
provide
myself
with
dressing
,
and
follow
him
immediately
to
the
quarter
-
deck
,
through
a
most
infernal
scene
of
slaughter
,
fire
,
smoak
,
and
uproar
!
    
<EOS>
Captain
Oakhum
,
who
lean
against
the
mizen
mast
,
no
sooner
see
me
approach
in
my
shirt
,
with
the
sleeve
tuck
up
to
my
arm
-
pit
,
and
my
hand
dye
with
blood
,
than
he
signify
his
displeasure
by
a
frown
,
and
ask
why
the
doctor
himself
do
not
come
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
Crampley
have
single
me
out
,
as
if
by
his
express
command
;
at
which
he
seem
surprized
,
and
threaten
to
punish
the
midshipman
for
his
presumption
,
after
the
engagement
:
in
the
mean
time
,
I
be
send
back
to
my
station
,
and
order
to
tell
Mackshane
,
that
the
captain
expect
him
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
safe
back
and
deliver
up
my
commission
to
the
doctor
,
who
flatly
refuse
to
quit
the
post
<EOS>
affigne
to
him
by
his
instruction
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
Morgan
,
who
(
I
believe
)
be
jealous
of
my
reputation
for
courage
,
undertake
the
affair
,
and
ascend
with
great
intrepidity
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
find
the
surgeon
obstinate
,
suffer
himself
to
be
dress
,
and
swear
he
would
confine
Mackshane
as
soon
as
that
service
should
be
over

during

of
four
hour

we

off

next

the

silence

<EOS>
a
breach

on

other
side

by
our

battery
,
large
enough
to
admit
a
middle
sized
baboon

provide
he
could
find
mean
to
climb
up
to
it
;
our
general
propose
to
give
the
assault
that
very
night
,
and
actually
order
a
detachment
on
that
duty
<EOS>
:
Providence
stand
our
friend
upon
this
occasion
,
and
put
it
into
the
heart
of
the
Spaniards
to
abandon
the
fort
,
which
may
have
be
maintain
by
resolute
man
,
to
the
day
of
judgment
against
all
the
force
we
could
exert
in
the
attack
.
 
<EOS>
and
while
our
soldier
take
possession
of
the
enemy
's
rampart
,
without
resistance
,
the
same
good
luck
attend
a
body
of
sailor
,
who
make
themselves
master
of
fort
<EOS>
St
Joseph
,
the
faschine
battery
,
and
one
spanish
man
of
war
;
the
other
three
be
burn
or
sink
by
the
foe
,
that
they
may
not
fall
into
our
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
taking
of
these
fort
,
in
the
strength
of
which
the
Spaniards
chiefly
confide
,
make
us
master
of
the
outward
harbour
,
and
occasion
great
joy
among
us
;
as
we
lay
our
account
with
find
little
or
no
opposition
from
the
town
:
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
if
a
few
great
ship
have
sail
up
immediately
,
before
they
have
recover
from
the
confusion
and
despair
that
our
unexpected
success
have
produce
among
them
,
it
be
not
impossible
that
we
may
have
finish
the
affair
to
our
satisfaction
,
without
any
more
blood
-
shed
:
but
this
our
Heroes
disdain
,
as
a
barbarous
insult
over
the
enemy
's
distress
;
and
give
them
all
the
respite
they
could
desire
,
in
order
to
recollect
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Mackshane
take
the
advantage
of
this
general
exultation
,
wait
on
our
captain
,
and
plead
his
own
cause
so
effectually
,
that
he
be
re
-
establish
in
his
good
grace
;
and
as
for
Crampley
,
there
be
no
more
notice
take
of
his
behaviour
towards
me
,
during
the
action
.
     
<EOS>
but
of
all
the
consequence
of
the
victory
,
none
be
more
grateful
than
plenty
of
fresh
water
,
after
we
have
languish
five
week
on
the
allowance
of
a
purser
's
quart
per
diem
for
each
man
,
in
the
Torrid
Zone
,
where
the
sun
be
vertical
,
and
the
expence
of
bodily
fluid
so
great
,
that
a
gallon
of
liquor
could
scarce
supply
the
waste
of
twenty
-
four
hour
;
especially
,
as
our
provision
consist
of
putrid
salt
beef
,
to
which
the
sailor
give
the
name
of
irish
horse
;
salt
pork
of
New
England
,
which
though
neither
fish
nor
flesh
,
favour
of
both
;
bread
from
the
same
country
,
every
biscuit
whereof
,
like
a
piece
of
clock
work
,
move
by
its
own
internal
impulse
,
occasion
by
the
myriad
of
insect
that
dwelt
within
it
;
and
butter
serve
out
by
the
gill
,
that
taste
like
train
-
oil
thicken
with
salt
.
<EOS>
instead
of
small
-
beer
,
each
man
be
allow
three
half
quarter
of
brandy
or
rum
,
which
be
distribute
every
morning
,
dilute
with
a
certain
quantity
of
his
water
,
without
either
sugar
or
fruit
to
render
it
palatable
,
for
which
reason
this
composition
,
be
by
the
sailor
not
unaptly
stile
necessity
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
limitation
of
simple
element
owe
to
a
scarcity
of
it
on
board
,
there
be
at
this
time
water
enough
in
the
ship
for
a
voyage
of
six
month
,
at
the
rate
of
half
a
gallon
per
day
to
each
man
:
<EOS>
but
this
fast
must
(
I
suppose
)
have
be
injoine
by
way
of
pennance
on
the
ship
's
company
for
their
sin
;
or
rather
with
a
view
to
mortify
them
into
a
contempt
of
life
,
that
they
may
thereby
become
more
resolute
and
regardless
of
danger
.
    
<EOS>
how
simply
then
do
those
people
argue
,
who
ascribe
the
great
mortality
among
us
,
to
our
bad
provision
and
want
of
water
;
and
affirm
,
that
a
great
many
valuable
life
may
have
be
save
,
if
the
useless
transport
have
be
employ
in
fetch
fresh
stock
,
turtle
,
fruit
,
and
other
refreshment
,
from
Jamaica
and
other
adjacent
island
,
for
the
use
of
the
army
and
fleet
!
<EOS>
see
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
that
those
who
die
go
to
a
well
place
,
and
those
who
survive
be
the
more
easily
maintain
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
,
a
sufficient
number
remain
to
fall
before
the
wall
of
St
Lazar
,
where
they
behave
like
their
own
country
mastis
,
which
shut
their
eye
,
run
into
the
jaw
of
a
bear
,
and
have
their
head
crush
for
their
valour
.
    
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
narration
:
<EOS>
after
have
put
garrison
into
the
fort
we
have
take
,
and
re
imbarke
out
soldier
and
artillery
,
which
detain
us
more
than
a
week
,
we
venture
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
inner
harbour
,
guard
by
a
large
fortification
on
one
side
,
and
a
small
re
-
doubt
on
the
other
,
both
of
which
be
desert
before
our
approach
,
and
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
block
up
by
several
old
galleon
that
the
enemy
have
sink
in
the
channel
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
shift
,
however
,
to
open
a
passage
for
some
ship
of
war
,
that
favour
the
second
landing
of
our
troop
at
a
place
call
La
Quinta
,
not
far
from
the
town
,
where
,
after
a
faint
resistance
from
a
body
of
Spaniards
,
who
oppose
their
disembarkation
,
they
encamp
with
a
design
of
besiege
the
castle
of
St
Lazar
,
which
overlook
and
command
the
city
:
    
<EOS>
whether
our
renowned
general
have
no
body
in
his
army
who
know
how
to
approach
it
in
form
,
or
that
he
trust
intirely
to
the
fame
of
his
arm
,
I
shall
not
determine
;
but
certain
it
be
,
a
resolution
be
take
in
a
council
of
war
,
to
attack
the
place
with
mufquetry
only
,
which
be
put
in
execution
,
and
succeed
accordingly
;
the
enemy
give
them
such
an
hearty
reception
,
that
the
great
part
of
the
detachment
take
up
their
everlasting
residence
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Our
chief
not
relish
this
kind
of
complaisance
in
the
Spaniards
,
be
wise
enough
to
retreat
on
board
with
the
remain
of
his
army
,
which
,
from
eight
thousand
able
man
land
on
the
beach
near
Bocca
Chica
,
be
now
reduce
to
fifteen
hundred
fit
for
service
.
 
<EOS>
the
sick
and
wound
be
squeeze
into
certain
vessel
,
which
thence
obtain
the
name
of
hospital
ship
,
though
methink
they
scarce
deserve
such
a
creditable
title
,
see
none
of
them
could
boast
of
either
surgeon
,
nurse
or
cook
;
and
the
space
between
deck
be
so
confine
,
that
the
miserable
patient
have
not
room
to
sit
upright
in
their
bed
.
<EOS>
Their
wound
and
stump
be
neglect
,
contract
filth
and
putrefaction
,
and
million
of
maggot
be
hatch
amid
the
corruption
of
their
fore
.
<EOS>
this
inhuman
disregard
be
impute
to
the
scarcity
of
surgeon
;
though
it
be
well
know
,
that
every
great
ship
in
the
fleet
could
have
spare
one
at
least
for
this
duty
,
which
would
have
be
more
than
sufficient
to
remove
this
shocking
inconvenience
:
    
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
,
the
general
be
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
ask
a
favour
of
this
kind
from
his
fellow
-
chief
,
who
on
the
other
hand
,
would
not
derogate
so
far
from
his
own
dignity
,
as
to
offer
such
assistance
unasked
;
for
I
may
venture
to
affirm
,
that
by
this
time
,
the
Daemon
of
discord
with
her
footy
wing
,
have
breathe
her
influence
upon
our
counsel
;
and
it
may
be
say
of
these
great
man
,
(
I
hope
they
will
pardon
the
comparison
)
as
of
Caesar
and
Pompey
,
the
one
could
not
brook
a
superior
,
and
the
other
be
impatient
of
an
equal
:
<EOS>
so
that
between
the
pride
of
one
,
and
insolence
of
another
,
the
enterprize
miscarry
,
accord
to
the
proverb
,
"
between
two
stool
the
backside
fall
to
the
ground
.
"
 
<EOS>
not
that
I
would
be
think
to
liken
any
publick
concern
to
that
opprobrious
part
of
the
human
body
,
although
I
may
with
truth
assert
,
if
I
durst
use
such
a
vulgar
idiom
,
that
the
nation
do
hang
an
a####se
at
its
disappointment
on
this
occasion
;
neither
would
I
presume
to
compare
the
capacity
of
our
heroic
leader
to
any
such
wooden
convenience
as
a
joint
-
stool
or
a
close
-
stool
;
but
only
signify
by
this
simile
,
the
mistake
the
people
commit
in
trust
to
the
union
of
two
instrument
that
be
never
join
.
    
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
after
the
attempt
on
St
Lazar
,
the
admiral
order
one
of
the
spanish
man
of
war
we
have
take
,
to
be
mount
with
sixteen
gun
,
and
man
with
detachment
from
our
great
ship
,
in
order
to
batter
the
town
;
accordingly
,
she
be
tow
into
the
inner
harbour
in
the
night
-
time
,
and
moor
within
half
a
mile
of
the
wall
,
against
which
she
begin
to
fire
at
daybreak
;
and
continue
about
four
hour
expose
to
the
opposition
of
at
least
forty
piece
of
cannon
,
which
at
length
oblige
our
man
to
set
her
on
fire
,
and
get
off
as
well
as
they
could
,
in
their
boat
.
 
<EOS>
this
piece
of
conduct
afford
matter
of
speculation
to
all
the
wit
,
either
in
the
army
or
the
navy
,
who
be
at
last
fain
to
acknowledge
it
a
stroke
of
policy
above
their
comprehension
.
     
<EOS>
some
entertain
such
an
irreverent
opinion
of
the
admiral
's
understanding
,
as
to
think
he
expect
the
town
would
surrender
to
his
float
battery
of
sixteen
gun
:
<EOS>
other
imagine
his
sole
intention
be
to
try
the
enemy
's
strength
,
by
which
he
would
be
able
to
compute
the
number
of
great
ship
that
would
be
necessary
to
bring
the
Spaniards
to
a
capitulation
:
but
this
last
conjecture
soon
appear
groundless
,
in
as
much
as
no
ship
of
any
kind
whatever
be
afterwards
employ
on
that
service
.
 
<EOS>
a
third
sort
swore
,
that
no
other
cause
could
be
assign
for
this
undertaking
,
than
that
which
induce
Don
Quixote
to
attack
the
windmill
.
    
<EOS>
a
fourth
class
(
and
that
the
most
numerous
,
though
without
doubt
,
compose
of
the
sanguine
and
malicious
)
plainly
tax
this
commander
with
want
of
honesty
as
well
as
sense
;
and
alledge
that
he
ought
to
have
sacrifice
private
pique
to
the
interest
of
his
country
;
that
where
the
life
of
so
many
brave
fellow
citizen
be
concern
,
he
ought
to
have
concur
with
the
general
,
without
be
sollicite
or
even
desire
,
towards
their
preservation
and
advantage
;
that
if
his
argument
could
not
dissuade
him
from
a
desperate
enterprize
,
it
be
his
duty
to
render
it
as
practicable
as
possible
,
without
run
extreme
hazard
;
that
this
could
have
be
do
,
with
a
good
prospect
of
success
,
by
order
five
or
six
large
ship
to
batter
the
town
while
the
land
force
storm
the
castle
,
by
this
means
,
a
considerable
diversion
would
have
be
make
in
favour
of
those
troop
,
who
in
their
march
to
the
assault
and
in
the
retreat
,
suffer
much
more
from
the
town
than
from
the
castle
;
that
the
inhabitant
see
themselves
vigorously
attack
on
all
hand
,
would
have
be
divide
,
distract
and
confused
,
and
in
all
probability
,
unable
to
resist
the
assailant
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
these
suggestion
surely
proceed
from
ignorance
and
malevolence
,
or
else
<EOS>
the
admiral
would
not
have
find
it
such
an
easy
matter
,
as
his
return
to
England
,
to
justify
his
conduct
to
a
ministry
at
once
so
upright
and
discerning
.
 
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
that
those
who
undertake
to
vindicate
him
on
the
spot
,
assert
<EOS>
,
there
be
not
water
enough
for
our
great
ship
near
the
town
;
tho
'
<EOS>
this
be
a
little
unfortunately
urge
,
because
there
happen
to
be
pilot
in
the
fleet
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
sounding
of
the
harbour
,
who
affirm
<EOS>
there
be
water
enough
for
five
eighty
gun
ship
to
lye
a
-
breast
in
,
almost
up
at
the
very
wall
.
 
<EOS>
the
disappointment
we
suffer
,
occasion
an
universal
dejection
,
which
be
not
at
all
alleviate
by
the
object
that
daily
and
hourly
entertain
our
eye
,
nor
by
the
prospect
of
what
must
inevitably
happen
,
if
we
remain
much
longer
in
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
oeconomy
in
some
ship
,
that
,
rather
than
be
at
the
trouble
of
inter
the
dead
,
their
commander
order
their
man
to
throw
the
body
over
-
board
,
many
without
either
ballast
or
winding
-
sheet
;
so
that
number
of
human
carcass
float
in
the
harbour
,
until
they
be
devour
by
shark
and
carrion
crow
;
which
afford
no
agreeable
spectacle
to
those
who
survive
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
wet
season
begin
,
during
which
,
a
deluge
of
rain
fall
from
the
rise
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
,
without
intermission
;
and
that
no
sooner
cease
,
than
it
begin
to
thunder
and
lighten
with
such
continual
flashing
,
that
one
can
see
to
read
a
very
small
print
by
the

<EOS>
just
as
we
sail
from
Bocca
Chica
on
our
return
to
Jamaica
,
I
find
myself
threaten
with
the
symptom
of
this
terrible
distemper
;
and
know
very
well
that
I
stand
no
chance
for
my
life
,
if
I
should
be
oblige
to
lie
in
the
cockpit
,
which
by
this

,
be
grow
intolerable
even
to
people
in
health
,
by
reason
of
the
heat
and
unwholsome
smell
of
decay
provision
;
I
write
a
petition
to
the
captain
represent
my
case
,
and
humbly
implore
his
permission
to
lie
among
the
soldier
in
the
middle
-
deck
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
air
:
<EOS>
but
I
may
have
spare
myself
the
trouble
;
for
this
humane
commander
refuse
my
request
,
and
order
me
to
continue
in
the
place
allot
for
the
surgeon
's
mate
,
or
else
be
content
to
lie
in
the
hospital
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
be
three
degree
more
offensive
and
more
suffocate
than
our
own
birth
below
.
 
<EOS>
another
in
my
condition
,
perhaps
,
would
have
submit
to
his
fate
,
and
die
in
a
pet
;
but
I
could
not
brook
the
thought
of
perish
so
pitifully
,
after
I
have
weather
so
many
gale
of
hard
fortune
:
I
therefore
,
without
mind
Oakhum
's
injunction
,
prevail
upon
the
soldier
(
whose
good
-
will
I
have
acquire
)
to
admit
my
hammock
among
them
;
and
actually
congratulate
myself
upon
my
comfortable
situation
,
which
Crampley
no
sooner
understand
,
than
he
signify
to
the
captain
,
my
contempt
of
his
order
;
and
be
invest
with
power
to
turn
me
down
again
into
my
proper
habitation
.
     
<EOS>
this
barbarous
piece
of
revenge
,
incense
me
so
much
against
the
author
,
that
I
vow
,
with
bitter
imprecation
,
to
call
him
to
a
severe
account
,
if
ever
it
should
be
in
my
power
;
and
the
agitation
of
my
spirit
increase
my
fever
to
a
violent
degree
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
lie
gasp
for
breath
in
this
infernal
abode
,
I
be
visit
by
a
serjeant
,
the
bone
of
whose
nose
I
have
reduce
and
set
to
right
,
after
they
have
be
demolish
by
a
splinter
during

:
He
be
inform

offer
me
the
use
of
his
birth
in
the
middle

deck
,
which
be
inclose
with
canvas
and
well

air
by
a
port
-
hole
that
remain
open
within
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
embrace
this
proposal
with
joy
,
and
be
immediately
conduct
to
the
place
,
where
I
be
treat
,
while
my
illness
last
,
with
the
utmost
tenderness
and
care
by
this
grateful
halberdier
,
who
have
no
other
bed
for
himself
than
a
hencoop
,
during

whole

<EOS>
here
I
lie
and
enjoy
the
breeze
,
notwithstanding
of
which
,
my
malady
gain
ground
,
and
at
length
my
life
be
despair
of
,
though
I
never
lose
hope
of
recovery
,
even
when
I
have
the
mortification
to
see
,
from
my
cabbin
window
,
six
or
seven
throw
over

board
every
day
,
who
die
of
the
same
distemper
.
<EOS>
this
confidence
,
I
be
persuade
,
conduce
a
good
deal
to
the
preservation
of
my
life
,
especially
,
when
join
to
another
resolution
I
take
at
the
beginning
,
namely
,
to
refuse
all
medicine
,
which
I
could
not
help
think
co
-
operate
with
the
disease
,
and
instead
of
resist
putrefaction
,
promote
a
total
degeneracy
of
the
vital
fluid
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
friend
Morgan
,
therefore
,
bring
his
diaphoretic
bolus
,
I
put
them
in
my
mouth
,
'
tis
true
,
but
without
any
intention
of
swallow
them
;
and
when
he
go
away
,
spit
them
out
,
and
wash
my
mouth
with
water
-
gruel
:
    
<EOS>
I
seemingly
comply
in
this
manner
,
that
I
may
not
affront
the
blood
of
Caractacus
,
by
a
refusal
which
may
have
intimate
a
diffidence
of
his
physical
capacity
;
for
he
act
as
my
physician
;
doctor
Macshane
never
once
enquire
about
me
,
or
even
know
where
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
distemper
be
at
the
height
,
Morgan
think
my
case
desperate
,
and
after
have
apply
a
blister
to
the
nape
of
my
neck
,
squeeze
my
hand
,
bid
me
,
with
a
woful
countenance
,
recommend
myself
to
Got
and
my
reteemer
;
then
take
his
leave
,
desire
the
chaplain
to
come
and
administer
some
spiritual
consolation
to
me
;
but
before
he
arrive
,
I
have
make
shift
to
rid
myself
of
the
troublesome
application
the
Welchman
have
bestow
on
my
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
parson
have
feel
my
pulse
,
enquire
into
the
nature
of
my
complaint
,
hem
a
little
,
and
begin
thus
:
"
Mr
Random
,
God
out
of
his
infinite
mercy
hath
be
pleased
to
visit
you
with
a
dreadful
distemper
,
the
issue
of
which
no
man
know
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
permit
to
recover
,
and
live
many
day
on
the
face
of
the
earth
:
and
,
which
be
more
probable
,
you
may
be
take
away
and
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
your
youth
:
<EOS>
It
be
incumbent
on
you
,
therefore
,
to
prepare
for
the
great
change
,
by
repent
sincerely
of
your
sin
;
of
this
there
can
not
be
a
great
sign
,
than
an
ingen'ous
confession
,
which
I
conjure
you
to
make
,
without
hesitaton
or
mental
reservation
;
and
when
I
be
convince
of
your
sincerity
,
I
will
then
give
you
such
comfort
as
the
situation
of
your
soul
will
admit
of
.
    
<EOS>
without
doubt
,
you
have
be
guilty
of
numberless
transgression
,
to
which
youth
be
subject
,
as
swearing
,
drunkenness
,
whoredom
,
and
adultery
;
tell
me
therefore
,
without
out
reserve
,
the
particular
of
each
,
especially
of
the
last
,
that
I
may
be
acquaint
with
the
true
state
of
your
conscience
:
for
no
physician
will
prescribe
for
his
patient
until
he
know
the
circumstance
of
his
disease
.
"
<EOS>
as
I
be
not
under
any
apprehension
of
death
,
I
could
not
help
smile
at
the
doctor
's
inquisitive
remonstrance
,
which
I
tell
him
savour
more
of
the
roman
than
of
the
protestant
church
,
in
recommend
auricular
confession
,
a
thing
,
in
my
opinion
,
not
at
all
necessary
to
salvation
,
and
which
,
for
that
reason
,
I
decline
.
 
<EOS>
this
reply
disconcert
him
a
little
;
however
,
he
explain
away
his
meaning
,
in
make
learned
distinction
between
what
be
absolutely
necessary
,
and
what
be
only
convenient
;
then
proceed
to
ask
what
religion
I
profess
:
I
answer
,
that
I
have
not
as
yet
consider
the
difference
of
religion
,
consequently
have
not
fix
on
any
one
in
particular
,
but
that
I
be
breed
a
Presbyterian
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
word
the
chaplain
discover
great
astonishment
,
and
say
,
he
could
not
comprehend
how
a
Presbyterian
be
entitle
to
any
post
under
the
english
government
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
ask
if
I
have
ever
receive
the
Sacrament
,
or
take
the
oath
;
to
which
I
reply
in
the
negative
,
he
hold
up
his
hand
,
assure
me
he
could
do
me
no
service
,
wish
I
may
not
be
in
a
state
of
reprobation
;
and
return
to
his
mess
-
mate
,
who
be
make
merry
in
the
ward
-
room
,
round
a
table
well
store
with
bumbo
and
wine
.
     
<EOS>
this
insinuation
,
terrible
as
it
be
,
have
not
such
an
effect
upon
me
,
as
the
fever
,
which
,
soon
after
he
have
leave
me
,
grow
outragious
;
I
begin
to
see
strange
chimera
,
and
conclude
myself
on
the
point
of
become
delirious
:
<EOS>
but
before
that
happen
,
be
in
great
danger
of
suffocation
,
upon
which
I
start
up
in
a
kind
of
frantic
fit
,
with
an
intention
to
plunge
myself
into
the
sea
,
and
as
my
friend
the
serjeant
be
not
present
,
would
certainly
have
cool
myself
to
some
purpose
,
have
I
not
perceive
a
moisture
upon
my
thigh
,
as
I
endeavour
to
get
out
of
my
hammock
:
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
this
revive
my
hope
,
and
I
have
reflection
and
resolution
enough
to
take
the
advantage
of
this
favourable
symptom
,
by
tear
the
shirt
from
my
body
and
the
sheet
from
my
bed
,
and
wrap
myself
in
a
thick
blanket
,
in
which
inclosure
,
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
<EOS>
,
I
feel
the
pain
of
hell
;
but
it
be
not
long
before
I
be
recompense
for
my
suffering
by
a
profuse
sweat
,
that
burst
from
the
whole
surface
of
my
skin
,
in
less
than
two
hour
,
relieve
me
from
all
my
complaint
,
except
that
of
weakness
;
and
leave
me
as
hungry
as
a
kite
.
 
<EOS>
I
enjoy
a
very
comfortable
nap
,
after
which
I
be
regale
myself
with
the
agreeable
reverie
of
my
future
happiness
,
when
I
hear
Morgan
,
on
the
outside
of
the
curtain
,
ask
the
serjeant
,
if
I
be
still
alive
?
"
<EOS>
alive
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
other
)
<EOS>
God
forbid
he
should
be
otherwise
!
<EOS>
he
have
lain
quiet
these
five
hour
,
and
I
do
not
chuse
to
disturb
him
,
for
sleep
will
do
him
great
service
.
"
<EOS>
"
ay
,
(
say
my
fellow
-
mate
)
<EOS>
he
sleep
so
find
,
<EOS>
(
look
you
)
that
he
will
never
waken
till
the
great
trump
plow

<EOS>
Got
be
merciful
to
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
pay
his
debt
,
like
an
honest
man
.
     
<EOS>
ay
,
and
moreover
,
he
be
at
rest
from
all
persecution
,
and
trouble
,
and
affliction
,
of
which
,
Got
know
,
and
I
know
,
he
have
his
own
share
.
 
<EOS>
Ochree
!
<EOS>
Ochree
!
<EOS>
he
be
a
promising
youth
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
groan
grievously
,
and
begin
to
whine
in
such
a
manner
,
as
persuade
me
he
have
a
real
friendship
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
serjeant
,
alarm
at
his
word
,
come
into
the
birth
,
and
while
he
look
upon
me
,
I
smile
,
and
tipt
him
the
wink
;
he
immediately
guess
my
meaning
,
and
remain
silent
,
which
confirm
Morgan
in
his
opinion
of
my
be
dead
;
whereupon
he
approach
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
in
order
to
indulge
his
grief
with
a
sight
of
the
object
:
<EOS>
and
I
counterfeit
death
so
well
,
by
fix
my
eye
,
and
drop
my
under
-
jaw
,
that
he
say
,
"
there
he
lie
,
<EOS>
no
petter
than
a
lump
of
clay
,
Got
help
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
observe
by
the
distortion
of
my
face
,
that
I
must
have
have
a
strong
struggle
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
be
able
to
contain
myself
much
longer
,
when
he
begin
to
perform
the
last
duty
of
a
friend
,
in
close
my
eye
and
my
mouth
;
upon
which
,
I
suddenly
snap
at
his
finger
,
and
discompose
him
so
much
,
that
he
start
back
,
turn
pale
as
ashe
,
and
stare
like
the
picture
of
horror
!
<EOS>
although
I
could
not
help
laugh
at
his
appearance
,
I
be
concerned
for
his
situation
,
and
stretch
out
my
hand
,
tell
him
,
I
hope
to
live
and
eat
some
salmagundy
of
his
making
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
he
could
recollect
himself
so
far
as
to
feel
my
pulse
,
and
enquire
into
the
particular
of
my
disease
:
    
<EOS>
but
when
he
find
I
have
enjoy
a
favourable
crisis
,
he
congratulate
me
upon
my
good
fortune
;
not
fail
to
ascribe
it
,
under
Got
,
to
the
blister
he
have
apply
to
my
back
,
at
his
last
visit
;
which
,
by
the
bye
,
say
he
,
must
now
be
remove
and
dress
:
He
be
actually
go
to
fetch
dressing
,
when
I
feign
astonishment
,
say
,
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
sure
you
never
apply
a
blister
to
me
 
there
be
nothing
on
my
back
,
I
assure
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
of
this
he
could
not
be
convince
till
he
have
examine
,
and
then
endeavour
to
conceal
his
confusion
,
by
express
his
surprize
in
find
the
skin
untouched
,
and
the
plaister
missing
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
excuse
myself
for
pay
so
little
regard
to
his
prescription
,
I
pretend
to
have
be
insensible
when
it
be
put
on
,
and
to
have
pull
it
off
afterwards
,
in
a
fit
of
delirium
.
<EOS>
this
apology
satisfy
my
friend
,
who
on
this
occasion
abate
a
good
deal
of
his
stiffness
in
regard
to
punctilio
;
and
as
we
be
now
safely
arrive
at
Jamaica
,
where
I
have
the
benefit
of
fresh
provision
,
and
other
refreshment
,
I
recover
strength
every
day
,
and
in
a
short
time
,
my
health
and
vigour
be
perfectly
re
-
establish
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
get
up
at
first
,
and
be
just
able
to
crawl
about
the
deck
,
with
a
staff
in
my
hand
,
I
meet
doctor
Mackshane
,
who
pass
by
me
with
a
disdainful
look
,
and
do
not
vouchsafe
to
honour
me
with
one
word
:
<EOS>
after
him
come
Crampley
,
who
strut
up
to
me
,
with
a
fierce
countenance
,
pronounce
,
"
here
be
fine
discipline
on
board
,
when
such
lazy
sculke
son
of
b####che
as
you

on
pretence

,
to
lollop
at

ease
,
while
your
better

to
hard
duty
!
"
     
<EOS>
the
sight
and
behaviour
of
this
malicious
scoundrel
,
enrage
me
so
much
,
that
I
could
scarce
refrain
from
lay
my
cudgel
across
his
pate
;
but
when
I
consider
my
present
feebleness
,
and
the
enemy
I
have
in
the
ship
,
who
want
only
a
pretence
to
ruin
me
,
I
restrain
my
passion
,
and
content
myself
with
tell
him
,
I
have
not
forget
his
insolence
and
malice
,
and
that
I
hope
we
should
meet
one
day
on
shore
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
he
grin
,
shake
his
fist
at
me
,
and
swear
he
long
for
nothing
more
than
such
an
opportunity
.

reason

other

not

it
convenient
for
him
to

with

who
on

wish
for
nothing
so
much

as
to
be
safe
without

all
his
care
and
tenderness
of
himself

be
insufficient
to
preserve
his
complexion
from
the

of

Our

leave

the

a

that
one
may
venture
to
affirm

half
so
sweet

scented

<EOS>
My
fellow

,
observe
no
surgeon
among
his
train
,
think
he
have
find
an
occasion
too
favourable
for
himself
to
be
neglect
;
and
remembre
the
old
proverb
,
"
spare

and
spare

resolve
to
sollicit
the
new
captain
's
interest
immediately
,
before
any

could
be

for
the

<EOS>
with
this
view
he
repair

<EOS>
enter
without

into

he
find
captain

repose
upon
a

with
a
wrapper
of
fine
chintz
about
his
body
,
and
a
muslin
cape
border
with
lace
upon
his
head
;
and
after
several
low
conge
's
,
begin
in
this
manner
:
 
<EOS>
"
Sir

I
hope
you
will
forgive
,
and
excuse
,
and
pardon
the
presumption
of

here
he
be
interrupt
by
the
captain
,
who
at
first
sight
of
him
have
start
up
with
great
amazement
at
the
novelty
of
the
apparition
;
and
have
recollect
himself
,
pronounce
,
with
a
look
and
tone
signify
disdain
,
curiosity
and
surprize
,
"

"
I
be
surgeon

(
reply
Morgan
)
and
I
most
vehemently
desire
and
beseech
you
with
all
submission
,
to
be
pleased
to
condescend
and
vouchsafe
to
enquire
into
my

and
my

,
which
,
under
Got
,
I
hope
,
will
entitle
me
to
the
vacancy
of
surgeon
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
proceed
in
his
speech
,
he
continue
advance
towards
the
captain
,
whose
nostril
be
no
sooner
salute
with
the
aromatick
flavour
that
exhale
from
him
,
than
he
cry
with
great
emotion
,
"

<EOS>
at
the
noise
of
his
outcry
,
his
servant
run
into
his
apartment
,
and
he
accost
them
thus
;
"

<EOS>
with
these
interjection
,
he
sink
down
upon
his

in
a
fit
;

him
with

push
Morgan
out

come
to

I
be

sit
down
with

,
accord
to
his

when

any
indignity

he
durst
not

begin
to
sing
a

<EOS>
I
guess
he
be
under
some
agitation
of
spirit
,
and
desire
to
know
the
cause
;
but
instead
of
answer
me

he
ask
with
great

if
I

odoriferous

<EOS>
I
crave
pardon
for
have
handle
him
so
roughly
,
and
with
the
utmost
care
and
tenderness
tie
up
his
arm
with
a
fillet
of
silk

<EOS>
while
I

he
desire
to
know
how
much
blood
I
intend
to
take
from
him
,
and
when
I
answer
,
"
not

"
start
up
with
a
look
full
of
horror
,
and
bid
me
begone
,
swear
I
have
a
design
upon
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Vergette
appease
him
with
some
difficulty
,
and
open
a
bureau
,
take
out
a
pair
of
scale
,
in
one
of
which
be
place
a
small
cup
;
and
put
them
into
my

tell
me
,
the
captain
never
lose
above
an
ounce
and
three
drachm
at
one
time
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
prepare
for
this
important
evacuation
,
there
come
into
the
cabbin
,
a
young
man
,
gayly
dress
,
of
a
very
delicate
complexion
,
with
a
kind
of
languid
smile
on
his
face
,
which
seem
to
have
be
render
habitual
,
by
a
long
course
of
affectation

the

no

hastily

fly
into

a

a
bear
to
surprize
me
,
and
stink
me
into
convulsion
with
the
fume
of
tobacco
.
"
 
<EOS>
Simper
,
who
by
this
time
,
I
find
,
be
oblige
to
art
for
the
clearness
of
his
complexion
,
assume
an
air
of
softness
and
sympathy
,
and
lament
with
many
tender
expression
of
sorrow
,
the
sad
accident
that
have
throw
him
into
that
condition
;
then
feel
his
patient
's
pulse
on
the
outside
of
his
glove
,
give
it
as
his
opinion
,
that
his
disorder
be
entirely
nervous
,
and
that
some
drop
of
tincture
of
castor
and
liquid
laudanum
,
would
be
of
more
service
to
him
than
bleed
,
by
bridle
the
inordinate
sally
of
his
spirit
,
and
compose
the
fermentation
of
his
bile
proceeding
therefrom
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
send
to
prepare
this
prescription
,
which
be
administre
in
a
glass
of
sack
-
posset
,
after
the
captain
have
be
put
to
bed
,
and
order
send
to
the
officer
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
to
let
no
body
walk
on
that
side
under
which
he
lie
.
    
<EOS>
while
the
captain
enjoy
his
repose
,
the
doctor
watch
over
him
,
and
indeed
become
so
necessary
,
that
a
cabin
be
make
for
him
contiguous
to
the
state
-
room
,
where
Whiffle
sleep
;
that
he
may
be
at
hand
in
case
of
accident
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
our
commander
be
happily
recover
,
give
order
,
that
none
of
the
lieutenant
should
appear
upon
deck
,
without
a
wig
,
sword
,
and
ruffle
;
nor
any
midshipman
,
or
other
petty
officer
,
be
see
with
a
check
shirt
or
dirty
linen
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
prohibit
any
person
whatever
,
except
Simper
and
his
own
servant
,
from
come
into
the
great
cabbin
,
without
first
send
in
to
obtain
leave
.
 
<EOS>
these
singular
regulation
do
not
prepossess
the
ship
's
company
in
his
favour
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
give
scandal
an
opportunity
to
be
very
busy
with
his
character
,
and
accuse
him
of
maintain
a
correspondence
with
his
surgeon
,
not
fit
to
be
name
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
few
week
,
our
ship
be
under
sailing
order
,
and
I
be
in
hope
of
re
-
visit
my
native
country
in
a
very
short
time
,
when
the
admiral
's
surgeon
come
on
board
,
and
send
for
Morgan
and
me
to
the
quarter
-
deck
,
give
me
to
understand
,
there
be
a
great
scarcity
of
surgeon
in
the
West
-
Indies
,
that
he
be
command
to
detain
one
mate
out
of
every
great
ship
that
be
bind
for
England
;
and
desire
us
to
agree
among
ourselves
,
before
the
next
day
at
that
hour
,
which
of
us
should
stay
behind
.
     
<EOS>
We
be
thunder
-
strike
at
this
proposal
,
and
stare
at
one
another
some
time
,
without
speak
;
at
length
the
Welchman
break
silence
,
and
offer
to
remain
in
the
West
-
Indies
,
provide
the
admiral
would
give
him
a
surgeon
's
warrant
immediately
:
<EOS>
but
he
be
tell
there
be
no
want
of
chief
surgeon
,
and
that
he
must
be
content
with
the
station
of
mate
,
till
he
should
be
further
provide
for
in
due
course
<EOS>
:
Whereupon
Morgan
flatly
refuse
to
quit
the
ship
for
which
the
commissioner
of
the
navy
have
appoint
him
;
and
the
other
tell
him
as
plainly
,
that
if
we
could
not
determine
the
affair
by
ourselves
before
tomorrow
morning
,
he
must
cast
lot
,
and
abide
by
his
chance
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
recall
to
my
remembrance
the
misery
I
have
undergo
in
England
,
where
I
have
not
one
friend
to
promote
my
interest
,
or
favour
my
advancement
in
the
navy
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
reflect
on
the
present
dearth
of
surgeon
in
the
West
-
Indies
,
and
the
unhealthiness
of
the
climate
,
which
every
day
,
almost
,
reduce
the
number
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
think
my
success
would
be
much
more
certain
and
expeditious
,
by
stay
where
I
be
,
than
by
return
to
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolve
to
comply
with
a
good
grace
,
and
next
day
,
when
we
be
order
to
throw
dice
,
tell
Morgan
,
he
need
not
trouble
himself
,
for
I
would
voluntarily
submit
to
the
admiral
's
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
this
frank
declaration
be
commend
by
the
gentleman
,
who
assure
me
,
if
should
not
fare
the
bad
with
me
for
my
resignation
:
    
indeed
he
be
as
good
as
his
word
,
and
that
very
afternoon
,
procure
a
warrant
,
appoint
me
surgeon
's
mate
of
the
Lizzard
sloop
of
war
,
which
put
me
on
a
footing
with
every
first
mate
in
the
service
.
    
<EOS>
My
ticket
be
make
out
,
I
put
my
chest
and
bed
on
board
a
canoe
that
be
along

side
,
and
have
shake
hand
with
my
trusty
friend
the
serjeant
,
and
honest
Jack
Rattlin
,
who
be
bind
for
Greenwich
-
hospital
<EOS>
,
I
take
my
leave
of
Morgan
with
many
tear
,
after
we
have
exchange
our
sleeve
-
button
as
remembrance
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
have
present
my
new
warrant
to
the
captain
of
the
Lizard
,
I
enquire
for
the
doctor
,
whom
I
no
sooner
see
,
than
I
recollect
him
to
be
one
of
those
young
fellow
with
whom
I
have
be
commit
to
the
round
-
house
,
during
our
frolick
with
Jackson
,
as
I
have
relate
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
me
with
a
good
deal
of
courtesy
,
and
when
I
put
him
in
mind
of
our
former
acquaintance
,
express
great
joy
in
see
me
again
,
and
recommend
me
to
an
exceed
good
mess
,
compose
of
the
gunner
and
the
master
's
mate
.
 
<EOS>
as
there
be
not
one
sick
person
in
the
ship
,
I
get
leave
to
go
ashore
,
next
day
,
with
the
gunner
,
who
recommend
me
to
a
Jew
,
that
buy
my
ticket
,
at
the
rate
of
40
per
cent
discount
;
and
have
furnish
myself
with
what
necessary
I
want
,
return
on
board
in
the
evening
,
and
to
my
great
surprize
,
find
my
old
antagonist
Crampley
walk
upon
deck
.
     
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
I
do
not
fear
his
enmity
,
I
be
shock
at
his
appearance
,
and
communicate
my
sentiment
on
that
subject
to
Mr
Tomlins
the
surgeon
,
who
tell
me
,
that
Crampley
,
by
the
dint
of
some
friend
about
the
admiral
,
have
procure
a
commission
constitute
him
lieutenant
on
board
the
Lizzard
:
and
advise
me
,
now
he
be
my
superior
officer
,
to
behave
with
some
respect
towards
him
,
or
else
he
would
find
a
thousand
opportunity
of
use
me
ill
.
 
<EOS>
this
advice
be
a
bitter
potion
to
me
,
whom
pride
and
resentment
have
render
utterly
incapable
of
the
least
submission
to
,
or
even
of
reconciliation
with
the
wretch
,
who
have
,
on
many
occasion
,
treat
me
so
inhumanly
:
<EOS>
however
,
I
resolve
to
have
as
little
connexion
as
possible
with
him
,
and
to
ingratiate
myself
as
much
as
I
could
with
the
rest
of
the
officer
,
whose
friendship
may
be
a
bulwark
to
defend
me
from
the
attempt
of
his
malice
.
    
<EOS>

with
the

his

for
England
.
  
<EOS>
when
my
patient
be
all
in

,
my
companion
and

,
whose
name
be
Brayl
,
carry
me
up
the
country
to
the
house
of
a
rich
planter
,
with
whom
he
be
acquaint
;
where
we
be
sumptuously
entertain
,
and
in
the
evening
set
out
on
our
return
to
the
ship
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
walk
about
a
mile
by
moon
-
light
,
we
perceive
a
horseman
behind
us
,
who
come
up
,
wish
us
good
even
,
and
ask
which
way
we
go
:
<EOS>
His
voice
,
which
be
quite
familiar
to
me
,
no
sooner
strike
my
ear
,
than
,
in
spite
of
all
my
resolution
and
reflection
,
my
hair
bristle
up
,
and
I
be
seize
with
a
violent
fit
of
tremble
,
which
Brayl
mis
-
interpreting
,
bid
me
be
under
no
concern
,
for
he
would
stand
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
he
be
mistake
in
the
cause
of
my
disorder
;
and
address
myself
to
the
person
on
horse
-
back
,
say
,
"
I
could
have
swear
by
your
voice
,
that
you
be
a
dear
friend
of
mine
,
if
I
have
not
be
certain
of
his
death
.
"
 
<EOS>
to
this
,
after
some
pause
,
he
reply
,
"
there
be
many
voice
as
well
as
face
that
resemble
one
another
;
but
pray
,
what
be
your
friend
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
I
satisfy
him
in
that
particular
,
and
give
a
short
detail
of
the
melancholy
fate
of
Thomson
,
not
without
many
sigh
and
some
tear
.
<EOS>
a
silence
ensue
which
last
some
minute
,
and
then
the
conversation
turn
on
indifferent
subject
,
till
we
arrive
at
a
house
on
the
road
,
where
the
horseman
alight
,
and
beg
with
so
much
earnestness
,
that
we
would
go
in
and
drink
a
bowl
of
punch
with
him
,
that
we
could
not
resist
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
alarm
at
his
voice
,
what
must
my
amazement
be
,
when
I
discover
by
the
light
,
the
very
person
of
my
lament
friend
!
<EOS>
perceive
my
confusion
,
which
be
extreme
,
he
clasp
me
in
his
arm
and
bedew
my
face
with
tear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
ere
<EOS>
I
recover
the
use
of
my
reason
,
overpower
with
this
event
,
and
longer
still
before
I
could
speak
.
<EOS>
so
that
all
I
be
capable
of
,
be
to
return
his
embrace
,
and
to
mingle
the
overflowing
of
my
joy
with
his
;
while
honest
Brayl
,
affect
with
the
scene
,
weep
as
fast
as
either
of
us
,
and
signify
his
participation
of
our
happiness
,
by
hug
us
both
,
and
caper
about
the
room
like
a
mad
-
man
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
retrieve
the
use
of
my
tongue
,
and
cry
,
"
be
it
possible
,
can
you
be
my
friend
Thomson
?
<EOS>
no
certainly
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
be
drown
!
<EOS>
and
I
be
now
under
the
deception
of
a
dream
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
I
relapse
into
tear
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
at
great
pain
to
convince
me
of
his
be
the
individual
person
whom
I
regret
,
and
bid
me
sit
down
and
compose
myself
,
promise
to
explain
his
sudden
disappearance
from
the
Thunder
,
and
to
account
for
his
being
at
present
in
the
land
of
the
living
.
     
<EOS>
this
he
acquit
himself
of
,
after
I
have
drink
a
glass
of
punch
,
and
recollect
myself
;
by
inform
us
,
that
with
a
determination
to
rid
himself
of
a
miserable
existence
,
he
have
go
in
the
night
-
time
to
the
head
,
while
the
ship
be
on
her
way
,
from
whence
he
slip
down
,
as
softly
as
he
could
by
the
bow
,
into
the
sea
,
where
,
after
he
be
heartily
duck
,
he
begin
to
repent
of
his
precipitation
,
and
as
he
could
swim
very
well
,
keep
himself
above
water
,
in
hope
of
be
take
up
by
some
of
the
ship
astern
;
 
that
in
this
situation
,
he
hail
a
large
vessel
and
beg
to
be
take
in
,
but
be
answer
,
that
she
be
a
heavy
sailor
,
and
therefore
they
do
not
chuse
to
lose
time
,
by
bring
to
;
however
,
they
throw
an
old
chest
over
-
board
,
for
his
convenience
,
and
tell
him
,
that
some
of
the
ship
a
-
stern
would
certainly
save
him
;
 
that
no
other
vessel
come
within
sight
or
cry
of
him
,
for
the
space
of
three
hour
,
during
which
time
he
have
the
mortification
of
find
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
alone
,
without
support
or
resting
-
place
,
but
what
a
few
crazy
board
afford
;
till
at
last
,
he
discern
a
small
sloop
steering
towards
him
,
upon
which
he
set
up
his
throat
,
and
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
hear
and
rescue
from
the
dreary
waste
,
by
their
boat
,
which
be
hoist
out
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
sooner
bring
on
board
(
continue
he
)
than
I
faint
;
and
when
I
recover
my
sense
,
find
myself
in
bed
,
regale
with
a
most
noisome
smell
of
onion
and
cheese
,
which
make
me
think
at
first
,
that
I
be
in
my
own
hammock
,
along
-
side
of
honest
Morgan
,
and
that
all
which
have
pass
be
no
more
than
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
upon
enquiry
I
understand
that
I
be
on
board
of
a
schooner
belong
to
Rhode
Island
,
bind
for
Jamaica
,
with
a
cargo
of
geese
,
pig
,
onion
,
and
cheese
;
and
that
the
master
's
name
be
Robertson
,
by
birth
<EOS>
a
North
Briton
,
whom
I
know
at
first
sight
to
be
an
old
school
-
fellow
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
discover
myself
to
him
,
he
be
transport
with
surprize
and
joy
,
and
beg
to
know
the
occasion
of
my
misfortune
,
which
I
do
not
think
fit
to
disclose
,
because
I
know
his
notion
with
regard
to
religion
,
be
very
severe
and
confined
;
therefore
contend
myself
with
tell
him
,
I
fall
over
-
board
by
accident
;
but
make
no
scruple
of
explain
the
nature
of
my
disagreeable
station
,
and
of
acquaint
him
with
my
determined
purpose
never
to
return
to
the
Thunder
man
of
war
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
 
although
he
be
not
of
my
opinion
in
that
particular
,
know
that
I
must
lose
my
cloath
,
and
what
pay
be
due
to
me
,
unless
I
go
back
to
my
duty
;
yet
,
when
I
describe
the
circumstance
of
the
hellish
life
I
lead
,
under
the
tyrannic
sway
of
Oakhum
and
Mackshane
;
and
among
other
grievance
,
hint
a
dissatisfaction
at
the
irreligious
deportment
of
my
ship
-
mate
,
and
the
want
of
the
true
presbyterian
gospel
doctrine
;
he
change
his
sentiment
,
and
conjure
me
with
great
vehemence
and
zeal
to
lay
aside
all
thought
of
rise
in
the
navy
;
and
that
he
may
shew
how
much
he
have
my
interest
at
heart
,
undertake
to
provide
for
me
in
some
shape
or
other
,
before
he
should
leave
Jamaica

<EOS>
this
he
perform
to
my
heart
's
desire

by
recommend
me
to
a
gentleman
of
fortune
,
with
whom
I
have
live
ever
since
,
in
quality
of
surgeon
and
overseer
to
his
plantation
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
lady
be
now
at
Kingston

so
that
I
be
,
for
the
present
,
master
of
this
house
,
to
which
,
from
my
soul
,
I
bid
you
welcome
,
and
hope
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
during
the
remain
part
of
the
night

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
a
second
invitation
;
but
Mr
Brayl
,
who
be
a
diligent
and
excellent
officer
,
could
not
be
persuade
to
sleep
out
of
the
ship
:
<EOS>
however
,
he
sup
with
us
,
and
after
have
drink
a
chearful
glass
,
set
out
for
the
vessel
,
which
be
not
above
three
mile
from
the
place
,
escort
by
a
couple
of
stout
Negroes
,
whom
Mr
Thomson
order
to
conduct
him
.
 
<EOS>
never
be
two
friend
more
happy
in
the
conversation
of
one
another
than
we
,
for
the
time
it
last
:
    
I
relate
to
him
the
particular
of
our
attempt
upon
Carthagena
,
of
which
he
have
hear
but
an
imperfect
account
;
and
he
gratify
me
with
a
narration
of
every
little
incident
of
his
life
since
we
part
.
 
<EOS>
He
assure
me
<EOS>
,
it
be
with
the
utmost
reluctance
,
he
could
resist
his
inclination
of
come
down
to
Port
-
Royal
to
see
Morgan
and
me
,
of
whom
he
have
hear
no
tiding
since
the
day
of
our
separation
;
but
that
he
be
restrain
by
the
fear
of
be
detain
as
a
deserter
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
when
he
hear
my
voice
in
the
dark
,
he
be
almost
as
much
surprize
as
I
be
at
see
him
afterwards
;
and
in
the
confidence
of
friendship
,
disclose
a
passion
he
entertain
for
the
only
daughter
of
the
gentleman
with
whom
he
live
,
who
,
by
his
description
,
be
a
very
amiable
young
lady
,
and
do
not
disdain
his
address
;
that
he
be
very
much
favour
by
her
parent
,
and
do
not
despair
of
obtain
their
consent
to
the
match
,
which
would
at
once
render
him
independent
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
congratulate
him
on
his
good
fortune
,
which
he
protest
should
never
make
him
forget
his
friend
;
and
towards
morning
we
betook
ourselves
to
rest
.
    
<EOS>
next
day
he
accompany
me
to
the
ship
,
where
Mr
Brayl
entertain
him
at
dinner
,
and
have
spend
the
afternoon
together
,
he
take
his
leave
of
us
in
the
evening
,
after
he
have
force
upon
me
ten
pistole
,
as
a
small
token
of
his
affection
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
while
we
staid
here
,
we
see
one
another
every
day
,
and
generally
eat
at
the
same
table
,
which
be
plentifully
supply
by
him
,
with
all
kind
of
poultry
,
butcher
's
meat
,
orange
,
lime
,
lemon
,
pine
-
aple
,
madeira
-
wine
,
and
excellent
rum
;
so
that
this
small
interval
of
ten
day
,
be
by
far
the
most
agreeable
period
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
Lizzard
arrive
;
and
as
my
patient
be
all
fit
for
duty
,
they
and
I
be
order
on
board
of
her
,
where
I
understand
from
Mr
Tomlins
,
that
there
be
a
dryness
between
the
lieutenant
and
him
,
on
my
account
;
that
rancorous
villain
have
take
the
opportunity
of
my
absence
,
to
fill
the
captain
's
ear
with
a
thousand
scandalous
story
,
to
my
prejudice
;
among
other
thing
affirm
,
that
I
have
be
once
transport
for
theft
,
and
that
when
I
be
in
the
Thunder
man
of
war
I
have
be
whipt
for
the
same
crime
.
 
<EOS>
the
surgeon
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
hear
my
whole
story
from
my
own
mouth
,
defend
me
strenuously
,
and
in
the
course
of
that
good
-
natured
office
,
recount
all
the
instance
of
Crampley
's
malice
against
me
,
while
I
remain
on
board
of
that
ship
.
 
<EOS>
which
declaration
,
while
it
satisfy
the
captain
of
my
innocence
,
make
the
lieutenant
as
much
my
defender
's
enemy
as
mine
.
<EOS>
this
infernal
behaviour
of
Crampley
,
with
regard
to
me
,
add
such
fuel
to
my
former
resentment
,
that
at
certain
time
,
I
be
quite
beside
myself
with
the
desire
of
revenge
,
and
be
even
tempt
to
pistol
him
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
though
an
infamous
death
must
inevitably
have
be
my
reward
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
surgeon
,
who
be
my
confident
,
argue
against
such
a
desperate
action
so
effectually
,
that
I
stifle
the
flame
which
consume
me
for
the
present
,
and
resolve
to
wait
a
more
convenient
opportunity
.
     
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
that
Mr
Tomlins
may
be
the
more
convinced
of
the
wrong
I
suffer
by
this
fellow
's
slander
<EOS>
,
I
beg
he
would
go
and
visit
Mr
Thomson
,
whose
wonderful
escape
I
have
make
him
acquaint
with
,
and
enquire
of
him
into
the
particular
of
my
conduct
,
while
he
be
my
fellow
-
mate
.
<EOS>
this
the
surgeon
comply
with
,
more
through
curiosity
to
see
a
person
whose
fate
have
be
so
extraordinary
,
than
to
confirm
his
good
opinion
of
me
,
which
,
he
assure
me
,
be
already
firmly
establish
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
set
out
for
the
dwelling
-
place
of
my
friend
,
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
me
;
and
be
receive
with
all
the
civility
and
kindness
I
expect
,
return
to
the
ship
,
not
only
satisfied
with
my
character
,
beyond
the
power
of
doubt
or
insinuation
,
but
also
charm
with
the
affability
and
conversation
of
Thomson
,
who
load
him
and
me
with
present
of
fresh
stock
,
liquor
and
fruit
.
<EOS>
as
he
would
not
venture
to
come
and
see
us
on
board
,
lest
Crampley
should
know
and
detain
him
,
when
the
time
of
our
departure
approach
,
I
obtain
leave
to
go
and
bid
him
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
after
we
have
vow
an
everlasting
friendship
,
he
press
upon
me
a
purse
with
four
double
dubloon
,
which
I
refuse
as
long
as
I
could
,
without
give
umbrage
;
and
have
cordially
embrace
each
other
,
I
return
on
board
,
where
I
find
a
small
box
,
with
a
letter
direct
for
me
,
to
the
care
of
Mr
Tomlins
.
 
<EOS>
know
the
superscription
to
be
of
Thomson
's
hand
-
writing
,
I
open
it
with
some
surprize
,
and
learn
that
this
generous
friend
,
not
content
with
load
me
with
the
present
already
mention
,
have
send
for
my
use
and
acceptance
,
half
a
dozen
fine
shirt
,
and
as
many
linnen
waistcoat
and
cap
,
with
twelve
pair
of
new
thread
-
stocking
.
 
<EOS>
be
thus
provide
with
money
,
and
all
necessary
for
the
comfort
of
life
,
I
begin
to
look
upon
myself
as
a
gentleman
of
some
consequence
,
and
feel
my
pride
dilate
apace
.
    
<EOS>
next
day
we
sail
for
Port
-
Royal
,
where
we
arrive
safely
with
our
prize
;
and
as
there
be
nothing
to
do
on
board
,
I
go
ashore
,
and
have
purchase
a
laced
waistcoat
,
with
some
other
cloath
at
a
vendue
,
make
a
swaggering
figure
for
some
day
,
among
the
tavern
,
where
I
venture
to
play
a
little
at
hazard
,
and
come
off
with
fifty
pistole
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
mean
while
our
captain
be
promote
to
a
ship
of
twenty
gun
,
and
the
command
of
the
Lizzard
give
to
a
man
turn
of
fourscore
,
who
have
be
lieutenant
since
the
reign
of
king
William
to
this
time
,
and
notwithstanding
his
long
service
,
would
have
probably
die
in
that
station
,
have
he
not
employ
some
prize
-
money
he
have
lately
receive
,
to
make
interest
with
his
superior
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Brayl
be
also
make
an
officer
about
the
same
time
,
after
he
have
serve
in
quality
of
midshipman
and
mate
five
and
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
soon
after
these
alteration
,
the
admiral
pitch
upon
our
ship
to
carry
home
dispatch
for
the
ministry
;
accordingly
we
set
sail
for
England

have
first
scrub
her
bottom

<EOS>
chapter
xxxvii
<EOS>
We
depart
for
Europe
 
<EOS>
a
misunderstanding
arise
between
the
captain
and
surgeon
,
through
the
scandalous
aspersion
of
Crampley
 
<EOS>
the
captain
die
 
Crampley
tyrannize
over
the
surgeon
,
who
fall
a
victim
to
his
cruelty
 
<EOS>
I
be
also
ill
used
 
<EOS>
the
ship
strike
 
the
behaviour
of
Crampley
and
the
seaman
on
that
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
on
shore
,
challenge
the
captain
to
single
combat
 
be
treacherously
knock
down
,
wound
and
rob
.
  
<EOS>
now
that
I
could
return
to
my
native
country
in
a
creditable
way
,
I
feel
excessive
pleasure
in
find
myself
out
of
sight
of
that
fatal
island
,
which
have
be
the
grave
of
so
many
Europeans
;
and
as
I
be
accommodate
with
every
thing
to
render
the
passage
agreeable
,
I
resolve
to
enjoy
myself
as
much
as
the
insolence
of
Crampley
would
permit
.
 
<EOS>
this
insidious
slanderer
have
find
mean
already
to
cause
a
misunderstanding
between
the
surgeon
and
captain
,
who
by
his
age
and
infirmity
be
render
intolerably
peevish
,
his
disposition
have
also
be
sowre
by
a
long
course
of
disappointment
,
and
have
a
particular
aversion
to
all
young
man
,
especially
to
surgeon
,
whom
he
consider
as
unnecessary
animal
on
board
of
a
ship
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
sentiment
,
he
never
consult
the
doctor
,
notwithstanding
his
be
seize
with
a
violent
fit
of
the
gout
and
gravel
,
but
apply
to
a
cask
of
Holland
-
gin
,
which
be
his
sovereign
prescription
against
all
distemper
:
<EOS>
but
whether
he
be
at
this
time
too
spare
,
or
take
an
overdose
of
his
cordial
,
certain
it
be
,
he
depart
in
the
night
,
without
any
ceremony
,
which
indeed
be
a
thing
he
always
despise
,
and
be
find
stiff
,
next
morning
,
to
the
no
small
satisfaction
of
Crampley
,
who
succeed
to
the
command
of
the
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
for
that
very
reason
,
Mr
Tomlins
and
I
have
no
cause
to
rejoice
at
this
event
,
fear
that
the
tyranny
of
our
new
commander
would
now
be
as
unlimited
as
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
day
of
his
command
justify
our
apprehension
:
for
on
pretence
that
the
deck
be
too
much
crowded
,
he
order
the
surgeon
's
hen
-
coop
,
with
all
his
fowl
,
to
be
throw
over
-
board
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
prohibit
him
and
me
from
appear
on
the
quarter
-
deck
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Tomlins
could
not
help
complain
of
these
injury
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
expostulation
drop
some
hasty
word
,
of
which
Crampley
take
hold
,
confine
him
to
his
cabbin
,
where
,
in
a
few
day
,
for
want
of
air
,
he
be
attack
by
a
fever
,
which
soon
put
an
end
to
his
life
,
after
have
make
his
will
,
by
which
he
bequeath
all
his
estate
,
personal
and
real
,
to
his
sister
;
and
leave
to
me
his
watch
and
instrument
,
as
remembrance
of
his
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
penetrate
with
grief
on
this
melancholy
occasion
!
<EOS>
the
more
because
there
be
no
body
on
board
,
to
whom
I
could
communicate
my
griefs
,
or
of
whom
I
could
receive
the
least
consolation
or
advice
.
 
<EOS>
Crampley
be
so
far
from
discover
the
least
remorse
for
his
barbarity
,
at
the
news
of
the
surgeon
's
death
,
that
he
insult
his
memory
in
the
most
abusive
manner
,
and
affirm
he
have
poison
himself
out
of
pure
fear
,
dread
to
be
bring
to
a
court
-
martial
for
mutiny
;
for
which
reason
,
he
would
not
suffer
the
service
of
the
dead
to
be
read
over
his
body
before
it
be
throw
over
-
board
.
    
<EOS>
Nothing
but
a
speedy
deliverance
could
have
support
me
under
the
brutal
sway
of
this
bashaw
;
who
to
render
my
life
the
more
irksome
,
signify
to
my
mess
-
mate
,
a
desire
that
I
should
be
expel
from
their
society
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
no
sooner
hint
,
than
they
grant
his
request
;
and
I
be
fain
to
eat
in
a
solitary
manner
by
myself
during
the
rest
of
the
passage
,
which
however
soon
draw
to
a
period
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
be
seven
week
at
sea
,
when
the
gunner
tell
the
captain
,
that
by
his
reckoning
we
must
be
in
sounding
,
and
desire
he
would
order
the
lead
to
be
heave
.
 
<EOS>
Crampley
swear
,
he
do
not
know
how
to
keep
the
ship
's
way
,
for
we
be
not
within
a
hundred
league
of
sounding
,
and
therefore
he
would
not
give
himself
the
trouble
to
cast
the
lead
.
     
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
continue
our
course
all
that
afternoon
and
night
,
without
shorten
fail
,
although
the
gunner
pretend
to
discover
scilly
light
;
and
next
morning
protest
in
form
against
the
captain
's
conduct
;
for
which
he
be
put
in
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
We
discover
no
land
all
that
day
,
and
Crampley
be
still
so
infatuated
as
to
neglect
sound
:
<EOS>
but
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
ship
strike
,
and
remain
fast
on
a
sand
bank
.
<EOS>
this
accident
alarm
the
whole
crew
;
the
boat
be
immediately
hoist
out
,
but
as
we
could
not
discern
which
way
the
shore
lie
,
we
be
oblige
to
wait
for
day
-
light
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
the
wind
increase
,
and
the
wave
beat
against
the
sloop
with
such
violence
,
that
we
expect
she
would
have
go
to
piece
.
<EOS>
the
gunner
be
release
and
consult
:
He
advise
the
captain
to
cut
away
the
mast
,
in
order
to
lighten
her
;
this
be
perform
without
success
:
the
sailor
see
thing
in
a
desperate
situation
,
accord
to
custom
,
break
up
the
chest
belong
to
the
officer
,
dress
themselves
in
their
cloath
,
drink
their
liquor
without
ceremony
;
and
drunkenness
,
tumult
,
and
confusion
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
uproar
,
I
go
below
to
secure
my
own
effect
;
and
find
the
carpenter
's
mate
hew
down
the
purser
's
cabbin
with
his
hatchet
,
whistle
all
the
while
,
with
great
composure
.
<EOS>
when
I
ask
his
intention
in
so
do
,
he
reply
very
calmly
,
"
I
only
want
to
taste
the
purser
's
rum
,
that
be
all
,
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
the
purser
come
down
,
and
see
his
effect
go
to
wreck
,
complain
bitterly
of
the
injustice
do
to
him
,
and
ask
the
fellow
what
occasion
he
have
for
liquor
,
when
in
all
likelihood
he
would
be
in
eternity
in
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
"
all
be
one
for
that
(
say
the
plunderer
)
let
us
live
while
we
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
miserable
wretch
that
thou
art
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
purser
)
<EOS>
what
must
be
thy
lot
in
the
other
world
,
if
thou
diest
in
the
commission
of
robbery
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
hell
,
I
suppose
,
(
reply
the
other
,
with
great
deliberation
,
)
"
while
the
purser
fall
on
his
knee
and
beg
of
heaven
that
we
may
not
all
perish
for
the
sake
of
one
Jonas
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
dialogue
,
I
cloathe
myself
in
my
good
apparel
,
gird
on
my
hanger
,
stick
my
pistol
load
in
my
belt
,
dispose
of
all
my
valuable
moveable
about
my
person
,
and
come
upon
deck
,
with
a
resolution
of
take
the
first
opportunity
to
get
on
shore
,
which
,
when
the
day
break
,
appear
at
the
distance
of
three
mile
a
-
head
.
 
<EOS>
Crampley
find
his
effort
to
get
the
ship
off
ineffectual
,
determine
to
consult
his
own
safety
,
by
go
into
the
boat
,
which
he
have
no
sooner
do
,
than
the
ship
's
company
follow
so
fast
,
that
she
would
have
sink
along
-
side
,
have
not
some
one
wise
than
the
rest
cut
the
rope
and
put
off
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
this
happen
,
I
have
make
several
attempt
to
get
in
,
and
be
always
baulk
by
the
captain
,
who
be
so
eager
in
exclude
me
,
that
he
do
not
mind
the
endeavour
of
any
other
body
.
 
<EOS>
enrage
at
this
inhuman
partiality
,
and
see
the
rope
cut
,
I
pull
one
of
my
pistol
from
my
belt
,
and
cock
it
,
swear
I
would
shoot
any
man
who
should
presume
to
obstruct
my
entrance
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
I
leap
with
my
full
exertion
,
and
get
on
board
of
the
boat
with
the
loss
of
the
skin
of
one
of
my
shin
.
     
<EOS>
I
chance
in
my
descent
to
overturn
Crampley
,
who
no
sooner
get
up
than
he
strike
at
me
several
time
with
a
cutlass
,
and
order
the
man
to
throw
me
overboard
;
but
they
be
too
anxious
about
their
own
safety
to
mind
what
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
boat
be
very
deeply
loaded
,
and
the
sea
terribly
high
,
we
make
shift
to
get
upon
dry
land
in
less
than
an
hour
after
we
part
from
the
sloop
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
set
foot
on
terra
firma
,
my
indignation
,
which
have
boil
so
long
within
me
,
break
out
against
Crampley
,
whom
I
immediately
challenge
to
single
combat
,
present
my
pistol
,
that
he
may
take
his
choice
:
He
take
one
without
hesitation
,
and
before
I
could
cock
the
other
fire
in
my
face
throw
the
pistol
after
the
shot
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
stunned
,
and
imagine
the
bullet
have
enter
my
brain
,
discharge
mine
as
quick
as
possible
,
that
I
may
not
die
unrevenged
;
then
fly
upon
my
antagonist
,
knock
out
several
of
his
fore
-
tooth
with
the
but
-
end
of
the
piece
;
and
would
certainly
have
make
an
end
of
him
with
that
instrument
,
have
he
not
disengage
himself
,
and
seize
his
cutlass
,
which
he
have
give
to
his
servant
when
he
receive
the
pistol
.
<EOS>
see
him
armed
in
this
manner
,
I
draw
my
hanger
,
and
have
flung
my
pistol
at
his
head
,
close
with
him
in
a
transport
of
fury
,
and
thrust
my
weapon
into
his
mouth
,
which
it
enlarge
on
one
side
to
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
smart
of
this
wound
disconcert
him
,
or
the
unevenness
of
the
ground
make
him
reel
,
I
know
not
,
but
he
stagger
some
pace
back
:
I
follow
close
,
and
with
one
stroke
cut
the
tendon
of
the
back
of
his
hand
,
upon
which
his
cutlass
dropt
,
and
he
remain
defenceless
.
     
<EOS>
I
know
not
with
what
cruelty
my
rage
may
have
inspire
me
,
if
I
have
not
at
that
instant
,
be
fell
to
the
ground
by
a
blow
on
the
back
part
of
my
head
,
which
deprive
me
of
all
sensation
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
receive
the
use
of
my
understanding
,
I
find
myself
alone
in
a
desolate
place
,
stript
of
my
cloath
,
money
,
watch
,
buckle
,
and
every
thing
but
my
shoe
,
stocking
,
breech
,
and
shirt
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
discovery
must
this
be
to
me
,
who
but
an
hour
before
,
be
worth
sixty
guinea
in
cash
!
<EOS>
I
curse
the
hour
of
my
birth
,
the
parent
that
give
me
be
,
the
sea
that
do
not
swallow
me
up
,
the
poignard
of
the
enemy
,
which
could
not
find
the
way
to
my
heart
,
the
villainy
of
those
who
have
leave
me
in
that
miserable
condition
,
and
in
the
exstacy
of
despair
,
resolve
to
lie
still
where
I
be
and
perish
.
   
<EOS>
chapter
xxxvii
<EOS>
I
get
up
,
and
crawl
into
a
barn
,
where
I
be
in
danger
of
perish
thro
'
the
fear
of
the
country
people
 
their
inhumanity
 
<EOS>
I
be
succour
by
a
reputed
witch
 
her
story
 
her
advice
 
<EOS>
she
recommend
me
as
a
valet
to
a
single
lady
,
whose
character
she
explain
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
I
lie
ruminate
,
my
passion
insensibly
abate
;
I
consider
my
situation
in
quite
another
light
from
that
in
which
it
appear
to
me
at
first
,
and
the
result
of
my
deliberation
be
to
get
up
if
I
could
,
and
crawl
to
the
next
inhabited
place
for
assistance
.
     
<EOS>
with
some
difficulty
I
get
upon
my
leg
,
and
have
examine
my
body
,
find
I
have
receive
no
other
injury
than
two
large
contused
wound
,
one
on
the
fore
and
another
on
the
hinder
part
of
my
head
;
which
seem
to
be
occasion
by
the
same
weapon
;
namely
,
the
butt
-
end
of
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
I
look
towards
the
sea
,
but
could
discern
no
remain
of
the
ship
;
which
make
me
conclude
she
have
go
to
piece
,
and
that
those
who
remain
in
her
have
perish
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
afterwards
learn
,
the
gunner
,
who
have
more
sagacity
than
Crampley
,
observe
that
it
be
flood
when
we
leave
her
,
and
that
she
would
possibly
float
at
high
-
water
,
make
no
noise
about
get
on
shore
,
but
continue
on
deck
,
in
hope
of
bring
her
safe
into
some
barbour
,
after
the
commander
have
desert
her
,
for
which
he
expect
,
no
doubt
,
to
be
handsomely
reward
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
accordingly
perform
,
and
be
promise
great
thing
by
the
admiralty
for
save
his
Majesty
's
ship
<EOS>
;
but
I
never
hear
he
reap
the
fruit
of
his
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
I
direct
my
course
towards
a
small
cottage
I
perceive
,
and
in
the
road
pick
up
a
sea
-
man
's
old
jacket
,
which
I
suppose
the
thief
who
dress
himself
in
my
cloath
,
have
throw
away
;
this
be
a
very
comfortable
acquisition
to
me
,
who
be
almost
stiff
with
cold
:
I
therefore
put
it
on
,
and
as
my
natural
heat
revive
,
my
wound
,
which
have
leave
off
bleed
,
burst
out
afresh
;
so
that
find
myself
excessively
exhaust
,
I
be
about
to
lie
down
in
the
field
,
when
I
discover
a
barn
on
my
left
hand
,
within
a
few
yard
of
me
;
thither
I
make
shift
to
stagger
,
and
find
the
door
open
,
go
in
,
but
see
no
body
;
upon
which
I
throw
myself
upon
a
truss
of
straw
,
hope
to
be
soon
relieve
by
some
person
or
other
.
     
<EOS>
I
have
not
lain
here
many
minute
<EOS>
,
when
I
see
a
countryman
come
in
with
a
pitch
-
fork
in
his
hand
,
which
he
be
upon
the
point
of
thrust
into
the
straw
that
conceal
me
,
and
in
all
probability
would
have
do
my
business
,
have
I
not
utter
a
dreadful
groan
,
after
have
essay
in
vain
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
this
melancholy
note
alarm
the
clown
,
who
start
back
,
and
discover
a
body
all
besmear
with
blood
,
stand
tremble
,
with
the
pitch
-
fork
extend
before
him
,
his
hair
erect
,
his
eye
stare
,
his
nostril
dilate
,
and
his
mouth
wide
open
.
 
<EOS>
at
another
time
,
I
should
have
be
much
divert
with
this
figure
,
which
preserve
the
same
attitude
very
near
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
during
which
time
I
make
many
unsuccessful
effort
to
implore
his
compassion
and
assistance
;
but
my
tongue
fail
me
,
and
my
language
be
only
a
repetition
of
groan
:
<EOS>
at
length
an
old
man
arrive
,
who
see
the
other
in
such
a
posture
,
cry
,
"

without
move
his

terrify
him
,
reply
,
"

"
 
<EOS>
the
father
,
whose
eye

sight
be
none
of
the
good
,
pull
out
his
spectacle
,
and
have
apply
them
to
his

,
reconnoitre
me
over

no

behold
me

than
he
be
seize
with
a
fit
of
shaking
,
even
more
violent
than
Dick
's
,
and
with
a
break
accent
address
me
thus
:
"

you
may
have
a

burial
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
as
I
be
not
in
a
condition
to
satisfy
him
in
this
particular
,
he
repeat
his
conjuration
to
no
purpose
;
and
they
continue
a
good
while
in
the
agony
of
fear
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
father
propose
,
that
the
son
should
draw
nearer
and
take
a
more
distinct
view
of
the
apparition
;
but
Dick
be
of
opinion
that
his
father
should
advance
first
,
as
be
an
old
man
past
his
labour
,
and
if
he
receive
any
mischief
,
the
loss
would
be
the
small
;
whereas
he
himself
may
escape
,
and
be
useful
in
his
generation
.
 
<EOS>
this
prudential
reason
have
no
effect
upon
the
senior
,
who
still
keep
Dick
between
me
and
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
I
endeavour
to
raise
one
hand
as
a
signal
of
distress
,
but
have
only
strength
sufficient
to
cause
a
rustling
among
the
straw
,
which
discompose
the
young
peasant
so
much
,
that
he
spring
out
at
the
door
,
and
overthrow
his
father
in
his
flight
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
would
not
spend
time
in
get
up
,
but
crawl
backwards
like
a
crab
,
with
great
speed
,
till
he
have
get
over
the
threshold
,
mumble
exorcism
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
mortify
to
find
myself
in
danger
of
perish
through
the
ignorance
and
cowardice
of
these
clown
;
and
feel
my
spirit
decay
apace
,
when
an
old
woman
enter
the
barn
,
follow
by
the
two
fugitive
,
and
with
great
intrepidity
advance
to
the
place
where
I
lay
,
say
,
"
if
it
be
the
devil
I
fearen
not
,
and
for
a
dead
mon
a
can
do
us
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
she
see
my
condition
,
she
cry
"
<EOS>
here
be
no
devil
,
but
in
youren
fool
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
poor
miserable
wretch
,
bleed
to
death
,
and
if
he
die
,
we
must
be
at
the
charge
of
bury
him
;
therefore
Dick
,
go
vetch
the
old
wheel
-
barrow
and
puten
in
,
and
carry
him
to
good
-
man
Hodge
's
back
-
door
<EOS>
,
he
be
more
eable
than
we
to
lay
out
money
upon
poor
vagrant
.
"
     
<EOS>
Her
advice
be
take
,
and
immediately
put
in
execution
:
I
be
roll
to
the
other
farmer
's
door
,
where
I
be
tumble
out
like
a
heap
of
dung
;
would
certainly
have
fall
a
prey
to
the
hog
,
if
my
groan
have
not
disturb
the
family
,
and
bring
some
of
them
out
to
view
my
situation
.
 
<EOS>
but
Hodge
resemble
the
Jew
more
than
the
good
Samaritan
,
and
order
me
to
be
carry
to
the
house
of
the
parson
,
whose
business
it
be
to
practise
as
well
as
to
preach
charity
:
observe
that
it
be
sufficient
for
him
to
pay
his
quota
toward
the
maintenance
of
the
poor
belong
to
his
own
parish
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
set
down
at
the
vicar
's
gate
,
he
fall
into
a
mighty
passion
,
and
threatne
to
excommunicate
him
who
send
as
well
as
those
who
bring
me
,
unless
they
would
move
me
immediately
to
another
place
.
 
<EOS>
about
this
time
I
faint
with
the
fatigue
I
have
undergo
,
and
afterwards
understand
that
I
be
bandy
from
door
to
door
through
a
whole
village
,
no
body
have
humanity
enough
to
administer
the
least
relief
to
me
,
until
an
old
woman
,
who
be
suspect
of
witchcraft
by
the
neighbourhood
,
hearing
of
my
distress
,
receive
me
into
her
house
,
and
have
dress
my
wound
,
bring
me
to
myself
with
cordial
of
her
own
preparing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
treat
with
great
care
and
tenderness
by
this
grave
matron
,
who
,
after
I
have
recover
some
strength
,
desire
to
know
the
particular
of
my
last
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
this
piece
of
satisfaction
<EOS>
I
could
not
refuse
to
one
who
have
save
my
life
,
therefore
relate
all
my
adventure
without
exaggeration
or
reserve
.
    
<EOS>
She
seem
surprised
at
the
vicissitudes
I
have
undergo
,
and
draw
a
happy
presage
of
my
future
life
,
from
my
past
suffering
,
then
launch
out
into
the
praise
of
adversity
with
so
much
ardour
and
good
sense
,
that
I
conclude
she
be
a
person
who
have
see
well
day
,
and
conceive
a
longing
desire
to
hear
her
story
.
 
<EOS>
She
perceive
my
drift
by
some
word
I
drop
,
and
smile
,
tell
me
,
there
be
nothing
either
entertaining
or
extraordinary
in
the
course
of
her
fortune
;
but
however
,
she
would
communicate
it
to
me
,
in
consideration
of
the
confidence
I
have
repose
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
little
consequence
(
say
she
)
to
tell
the
name
of
my
parent
,
who
be
dead
many
year
ago
:
let
it
suffice
to
assure
you
<EOS>
,
they
be
wealthy
,
and
have
no
other
child
than
me
,
so
that
I
be
look
upon
as
heiress
to
a
considerable
estate
,
and
tieze
with
address
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
among
the
number
of
my
admirer
,
there
be
a
young
gentleman
of
no
fortune
,
whose
sole
dependence
be
on
his
promotion
in
the
army
,
in
which
at
that
time
he
bear
a
lieutenant
's
commission
.
 
<EOS>
I
conceive
an
affection
for
this
amiable
officer
,
which
in
a
short
time
encrease
to
a
violent
passion
,
and
,
without
enter
into
minute
circumstance
,
marry
him
privately
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
enjoy
one
another
long
,
in
steal
interview
,
when
he
be
order
with
his
regiment
to
flander
;
but
before
he
set
out
,
it
be
agree
between
us
,
that
he
should
declare
our
marriage
to
my
father
by
letter
,
and
implore
his
pardon
for
the
step
we
have
take
without
his
approbation
.
     
<EOS>
this
be
do
while
I
be
abroad
visit
,
and
just
as
I
be
about
to
return
home
,
I
receive
a
letter
from
my
father
,
import
,
that
since
I
have
act
so
undutifully
and
meanly
,
as
to
marry
a
beggar
,
without
his
privity
or
consent
,
to
the
disgrace
of
his
family
,
as
well
as
the
disappointment
of
his
hope
,
he
renounce
me
to
the
miserable
fate
I
have
entail
upon
myself
,
and
charge
me
never
to
set
foot
within
his
door
again
.
 
<EOS>
this
rigid
sentence
be
confirm
by
my
mother
,
who
,
in
a
postscript
,
give
me
to
understand
that
her
sentiment
be
exactly
conformable
to
those
of
my
father
,
and
that
I
may
save
myself
the
trouble
of
make
any
application
,
for
her
resolution
be
unalterable
.
 
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
with
my
evil
fortune
,
I
call
a
coach
and
drive
to
my
husband
's
lodging
,
where
I
find
him
wait
the
event
of
his
letter
.
 
<EOS>
though
he
could
easily
divine
by
my
look
,
the
issue
of
his
declaration
,
he
read
with
great
steadiness
the
epistle
I
have
receive
;
and
with
a
smile
full
of
tenderness
,
which
I
shall
never
forget
,
embrace
me
,
say
,
I
believe
the
good
lady
your
mother
may
have
spare
herself
the
trouble
of
the
last
part
of
her
postscript
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
Betty
,
you
must
lay
aside
all
thought
of
a
coach
,
till
I
can
procure
the
command
of
a
regiment
.
 
<EOS>
this
unconcerned
behaviour
,
while
it
enable
me
to
support
my
reverse
of
fortune
,
at
the
same
time
endear
him
to
me
the
more
,
by
convince
me
of
his
disinterested
view
in
espouse
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
next
day
board
in
company
with
the
wife
of
another
officer
,
who
have
long
be
friend
and
confident
of
my
husband
,
at
a
village
not
far
from
London
,
where
they
part
with
us
in
the
most
melting
manner
,
go
to
Flanders
,
and
be
kill
in
sight
of
one
another
at
the
battle
of
the
Wood
.
     
<EOS>
why
should
I
tire
you
with
a
description
of
our
unutterable
sorrow
at
the
fatal
news
of
this
event
,
the
remembrance
of
which
now
fill
my
aged
eye
with
tear
!
<EOS>
when
our
grief
subside
a
little
,
and
reflection
come
to
our
aid
,
we
find
ourselves
desert
by
the
whole
world
,
and
in
danger
of
perish
for
want
:
Whereupon
we
make
application
for
the
pension
,
and
be
put
upon
the
list
.
<EOS>
then
vow
eternal
friendship
,
fold
our
jewel
and
superfluous
cloath
,
retire
to
this
place
(
which
be
in
the
county
of
Sussex
)
buy
this
little
house
,
where
we
live
may
year
in
a
solitary
manner
,
indulge
our
mutual
sorrow
,
 
'
till
it
please
heaven
to
call
away
my
companion
,
two
year
ago
;
since
which
time
I
have
linger
out
an
unhappy
being
,
in
hope
of
a
speedy
dissolution
,
when
I
promise
myself
the
eternal
reward
of
all
my
care
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
(
continue
she
)
<EOS>
I
must
inform
you
of
the
character
I
bear
among
my
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
My
conversation
be
different
from
that
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
village
,
my
recluse
way
of
life
,
my
skill
in
cure
distemper
,
which
I
acquire
from
book
since
I
settle
here
,
and
lastly
,
my
age
,
have
make
the
common
people
look
upon
me
as
something
preternatural
,
and
I
be
actually
at
this
hour
believe
to
be
a
witch
.
    
<EOS>
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
whose
acquaintance
I
have
not
be
at
much
pain
to
cultivate
,
take
umbrage
at
my
supposed
disrespect
,
have
contribute
not
a
little
towards
the
confirmation
of
this
opinion
,
by
drop
certain
hint
to
my
prejudice
,
among
the
vulgar
,
who
be
also
very
much
scandalize
at
my
entertaining
this
poor
tabby
cat
with
the
collar
about
her
neck
,
which
be
a
favourite
of
my
deceased
companion
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
whole
behaviour
of
this
venerable
person
,
be
so
primitive
,
innocent
,
sensible
,
and
humane
,
that
I
contract
a
filial
respect
for
her
,
and
beg
her
advice
with
regard
to
my
future
conduct
,
as
soon
as
I
be
in
a
condition
to
act
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
dissuade
me
from
a
design
I
have
form
of
travel
to
London
in
hope
of
retrieve
my
cloath
and
pay
,
by
return
to
my
ship
,
which
by
this
time
,
I
read
in
a
newspaper
,
be
safely
arrive
in
the
river
Thames
:
"
because
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
you
run
the
hazard
of
be
treat
not
only
as
a
deserter
,
in
quit
the
sloop
,
but
also
as
a
mutineer
in
assault
your
command
officer
,
to
the
malice
of
whose
revenge
you
will
moreover
be
expose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
then
promise
to
recommend
me
as
a
servant
to
a
single
lady
of
her
acquaintance
,
who
live
in
the
neighbourhood
with
her
nephew
,
who
be
a
young
fox
-
hunter
of
great
fortune
,
where
I
may
be
very
happy
,
provide
I
could
bear
with
the
disposition
and
manner
of
my
mistress
,
which
be
somewhat
whimsical
and
particular
.
 
<EOS>
but
above
all
thing
,
she
counsel
me
to
conceal
my
story
,
the
knowledge
of
which
would
effectually
poison
my
entertainment
;
for
it
be
a
maxim
among
most
people
of
condition
,
that
no
gentleman
in
distress
ought
to
be
admit
into
a
family
,
as
a
domestick
,
lest
he
become
proud
,
lazy
,
and
insolent
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
fain
to
embrace
this
humble
proposal
,
because
my
affair
be
desperate
;
and
in
a
few
day
be
hire
by
this
lady
,
to
serve
in
quality
of
her
footman
;
be
represent
by
my
hostess
,
as
a
young
man
,
who
have
be
send
to
sea
by
his
relation
against
his
inclination
,
be
shipwreck
and
rob
,
which
have
encrease
his
disgust
to
that
way
of
life
so
much
,
that
he
rather
choose
to
go
to
service
on
shore
than
enter
himself
on
board
of
any
other
ship
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
take
possession
of
my
new
place
,
she
give
me
a
sketch
of
my
mistress
's
character
,
that
I
may
know
better
how
to
regulate
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
lady
(
say
she
)
be
a
maiden
of
forty
year
,
not
so
remarkable
for
her
beauty
as
her
learning
and
taste
,
which
be
famous
all
over
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
she
be
a
perfect
female
virtuosi
,
and
so
eager
after
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
<EOS>
,
that
she
neglect
her
person
even
to
a
degree
of
sluttishness
;
<EOS>
this
negligence
,
together
with
her
contempt
for
the
male
part
of
the
creation
,
give
her
nephew
no
great
concern
,
as
by
that
mean
,
he
will
probably
keep
her
fortune
,
which
be
considerable
,
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
permit
her
to
live
in
her
own
way
,
which
be
something
extraordinary
,
and
gratify
her
in
all
her
whimsical
desire
.
 
<EOS>
Her
apartment
be
at
some
distance
from
the
other
inhabited
part
of
the
house
;
and
consist
of
a
dining
-
room

bed
-
chamber
and
study
:
She
keep
a
cook
-
maid
,
waiting
-
woman
,
and
footman
of
her
own
,
and
seldom
eat
or
converse
with
any
of
the
family
,
but
her
niece
,
who
be
a
very
lovely
creature
,
and
humour
her
aunt
often
to
the
prejudice
of
her
own
health
,
by
sit
up
with
her
whole
night
together
;
for
your
mistress
be
too
much
of
a
philosopher
to
be
sway
by
the
custom
of
the
world
,
and
never
sleep
or
eat
as
other
people
do
.
     
<EOS>
among
other
odd
notion
,
she
profess
the
principle
of
Rosicrucius
,
and
believe
the
earth
,
air
,
and
sea
be
inhabit
by
invisible
being
,
with
whom
it
be
possible
for
the
human
specie
to
entertain
correspondence
and
intimacy
,
on
the
easy
condition
of
live
chaste
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
hope
one
day
to
be
admit
into
an
acquaintance
of
this
kind
,
she
no
sooner
hear
of
me
and
my
cat
,
than
she
pay
me
a
visit
,
with
a
view
,
as
she
have
since
own
,
to
be
introduce
to
my
familiar
;
and
be
greatly
mortify
to
find
herself
disappointed
in
her
expectation
.
<EOS>
be
by
this
visionary
turn
of
mind
,
abstract
as
it
be
from
the
world
,
she
can
not
advert
to
the
common
occurrence
of
life
;
and
therefore
be
frequently
so
absent
as
to
commit
very
strange
mistake
and
extravagancy
,
which
you
will
do
well
to
rectify
and
repair
,
as
your
prudence
shall
suggest

Squire
 
<EOS>

acquainted
with
more
particular
of
Narcissa
's
situation
 
<EOS>
conceive
a
mortal
hatred
against
Sir
Timothy
 
<EOS>
I
examine
my
lady
's
library
and
performance
 
her
extravagant
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
fraught
with
these
useful
instruction
,
I
repair
to
the
place
of
her
habitation
,
and
be
introduce
by
the
waiting
-
woman
,
to
the
presence
of
my
lady
,
who
have
not
before
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
in
her
study
,
with
one
foot
on
the
ground
,
and
the
other
upon
a
high
stool
at
some
distance
from
her
seat
;
her
sandy
lock
hang
down
in
a
disorder
I
can
not
call
beautiful
from
her
head
,
which
be
deprive
of
its
coif
,
for
the
benefit
of
scratching
with
one
hand
,
while
she
hold
the
stump
of
a
pen
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Her
fore
-
head
be
high
and
wrinkle
,
her
eye
large
,
grey
and
prominent
;
her
nose
long
,
sharp
and
aquiline
;
her
mouth
of
vast
capacity
;
her
visage
meagre
and
freckle
,
and
her
chin
peek
like
a
shoemaker
's
paring
-
knife
:
    
<EOS>
Her
upper
-
lip
contain
a
large
quantity
of
plain
Spanish
,
which
by
continual
falling
,
have
embroider
her
neck
that
be
not
naturally
very
white
,
and
the
breast
of
her
gown
,
that
flow
loose
about
her
with
a
negligence
truly
poetic
,
discovering
linen
that
be
very
fine
and
to
all
appearance
,
never
wash
but
in
Castalian
stream
.
 
<EOS>
around
her
lay
heap
of
book
,
globe
,
quadrant
,
telescope
,
and
other
learn
apparatus
:
Her
snuff
-
box
stand
at
her
right
hand
,
at
her
left
lie
her
handkerchief
sufficiently
use
,
and
a
convenience
to
spit
in
appear
on
one
side
of
her
chair
.
 
<EOS>
be
in
a
reverie
when
we
enter
,
the
maid
do
not
think
proper
to
disturb
her
;
so
that
we
wait
some
minute
unobserved
,
during
which
time
,
she
bite
the
quill
several
time
,
alter
her
position
,
make
many
wry
face
,
and
at
length
,
with
an
air
of
triumph
,
repeat
aloud
;
    
"
nor
dare
th
'
immortal
god
my
rage
oppose
!
"
    
<EOS>
have
commit
her
success
to
paper
,
she
turn
toward
the
door
,
and
perceive
us
,
cry
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
the
young
man
(
reply
my
conductress
)
<EOS>
whom
Mrs
Sagely
recommend
as
a
footman
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
on
this
information
,
she
stare
in
my
face
a
considerable
time
,
and
then
ask
my
name
,
which
I
think
proper
to
conceal
under
that
of
John
Brown
.
 
<EOS>
after
have
survey
me
with
a
curious
eye
,
she
break
out
into
"
o
!
<EOS>
ay
,
thou
wa'st
shipwreck
<EOS>
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
whether
didst
thou
come
on
shore
on
the
back
of
a
whale
or
a
dolphin
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
this
I
answer
,
I
have
swam
ashore
without
any
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
demand
to
know
if
I
have
ever
be
at
the
Hellespont
,
and
swam
from
Sestos
to
Abydos
.
<EOS>
I
reply
in
the
negative
:
upon
which
,
she
bid
the
maid
order
a
suit
of
new
livery
for
me
,
and
instruct
me
in
the
article
of
my
duty
;
so
say
,
she
spit
in
her
snuff
-
box
,
and
wipe
her
nose
with
her
cap
which
lie
on
the
table
,
instead
of
a
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
We
return
to
the
kitchin
,
where
I
be
regale
by
the
maid
,
who
seem
to
outvie
with
one
another
,
in
express
their
regard
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
from
them
I
understand
,
that
my
business
consist
in
clean
knife
and
fork
,
lay
the
cloth
,
wait
at
table
,
carry
message
,
and
attend
my
lady
when
she
go
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
good
suit
of
livery
in
the
house
,
which
have
belong
to
my
predecessor
decease
,
I
dress
myself
in
it
,
and
find
it
fit
me
exactly
,
so
that
there
be
no
occasion
for
employ
a
taylor
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
long
equip
in
this
manner
,
when
my
lady
's
bell
rung
;
upon
which
I
run
up
stair
,
and
find
her
stalk
about
the
room
in
her
shift
and
under
-
petticoat
only
,
I
would
have
immediately
retire
,
as
become
me
;
but
she
bid
me
come
in
,
and
air
a
clean
shift
for
her
;
which
have
do
with
some
backwardness
,
she
put
it
on
before
me
without
any
ceremony
,
and
I
verily
believe
be
ignorant
of
my
sex
all
the
time
,
be
quite
absorpt
in
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
about
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
I
be
order
to
lay
the
cloth
,
and
place
two
cover
,
which
I
understand
be
for
my
mistress
and
her
niece
,
whom
I
have
not
as
yet
see
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
be
not
very
dexterous
at
this
operation
,
I
perform
it
pretty
well
for
a
beginner
,
and
when
dinner
be
upon
the
table
,
see
my
mistress
approach
accompany
with
the
young
lady
,
whose
name
for
the
present
shall
be
Narcissa
.
     
<EOS>
so
much
sweetness
appear
in
the
countenance
and
carriage
of
this
amiable
apparition
,
that
my
heart
be
captivate
at
first
sight
,
and
while
dinner
last
I
gaze
upon
her
without
intermission
.
 
<EOS>
Her
age
seem
to
be
seventeen
,
her
stature
tall
,
her
shape
unexceptionable
,
her
hair
,
that
fall
down
upon
her
ivory
neck
in
ringlet
,
black
as
jet
;
her
arched
eyebrow
of
the
same
colour
;
her
eye
pierce
,
yet
tender
;
her
lip
of
the
consistence
and
hue
of
cherry
;
her
complexion
clear
,
delicate
and
healthy
;
her
aspect
noble
,
ingen'ous
and
humane
;
and
the
whole
so
ravishingly
delightful
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
any
creature
,
endue
with
sensibility
,
to
see
without
admire
,
and
admire
without
love
her
to
excess
!
<EOS>
how
often
do
I
curse
the
servile
station
,
that
place
me
so
infinitely
beneath
the
regard
of
this
idol
of
my
adoration
!
<EOS>
and
how
often
do
I
bless
my
fate
,
that
enable
me
to
enjoy
daily
the
sight
of
so
much
perfection
!
<EOS>
when
she
speak
,
I
listen
with
pleasure
;
but
when
she
speak
to
me
,
my
soul
be
thrill
with
an
exstasy
of
tumultuous
joy
!
<EOS>
I
be
even
so
happy
as
to
be
the
subject
of
their
conversation
:
<EOS>
for
Narcissa
have
observe
me
,
say
to
her
aunt
,
"
I
see
your
new
footman
be
come
.
"
<EOS>
then
address
herself
to
me
,
ask
,
with
ineffable
complacency
,
if
I
be
the
person
who
have
be
so
cruelly
use
by
robber
?
<EOS>
when
I
satisfy
her
in
this
,
she
express
a
desire
of
know
the
particular
of
my
fortune
both
before
and
since
my
be
shipwreck
:
    
Hereupon
(
as
Mrs
Sagely
have
counsel
me
)
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
that
I
have
be
bind
apprentice
to
the
master
of
a
ship
,
contrary
to
my
inclination
,
which
ship
have
founder
at
sea
;
 
that
I
and
four
more
,
who
chance
to
be
on
deck
when
she
go
down
,
make
shift
to
swim
to
the
shore
,
where
my
companion
,
after
have
overpower
me
,
stript
me
to
the
shirt
,
and
leave
me
,
as
they
imagine
,
dead
of
the
wound
I
receive
in
my
own
defence
:
<EOS>
then
I
relate
the
circumstance
of
my
being
find
in
a
barn
,
with
the
inhuman
treatment
I
meet
with
from
the
country
people
and
parson
;
which
I
perceive
,
draw
tear
from
the
charming
creature
's
eye
!
<EOS>
when
I
have
finish
my
recital
,
my
mistress
say
,
"
Ma
foy
!
<EOS>
le
garcon
est
bien
fait
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
which
opinion
Narcissa
assent
,
with
a
compliment
to
my
understanding
in
the
same
language
,
that
flatter
my
vanity
extremely
.
    
<EOS>
the
conversation
,
among
other
subject
,
turn
upon
the
young
"
Squire
,
whom
my
lady
enquire
after
,
under
the
title
of
the
Savage
;
and
be
inform
by
her
niece
,
that
he
be
still
in
bed
,
repair
the
fatigue
of
last
night
's
debauch
,
and
recruit
strength
and
spirit
to
undergo
a
fox

,
in
company
with
Sir

Squire
Bumper
,
and
a
great
many
other
gentleman
of
the
same
stamp
,
whom
he
have
invite
on
that
occasion
;
so
that
by
daybreak
,
the
whole
house
would
be
in
an
uproar
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
disagreeable
piece
of
news
to
the
virtuosi
,
who
protest
she
would
stuff
her
ear
with
cotton
when
she
go
to
bed
,
and
take
a
dose
of
opium
to
make
her
sleep
the
more
sound
,
that
she
may
not
be
disturb
and
distract
by
the
clamour
of
the
brute
.
    
<EOS>
when
their
dinner
be
over
,
I
and
my
fellow
-
servant
sit
down
to
our
in
the
kitchen
,
where
I
understand
that
Sir
Timothy
Thicket
be
a
wealthy
knight
in
the
neighbourhood
,
between
whom
and
Narcissa
a
match
have

chapter
XL
<EOS>
She
be
surprize
at
my
learning
 
<EOS>
communicate
her
performance
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
impart
some
of
mine
to
her
 
<EOS>
be
mortify
at
her
faint
praise
 
<EOS>
Narcissa
approve
of
my
production
 
<EOS>
I
gain
an
involuntary
conquest
over
the
cook
-
wench
and
dairy
-
maid
 
their
mutual
resentment
and
insinuation
 
the
jealousy
of
their
lover
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
season
of
love
and
tranquility
,
my
muse
,
which
have
lain
dormant
so
long
,
awoke
,
and
produce
several
small
performance
on
the
subject
of
my
flame
:
<EOS>
but
as
it
concern
me
nearly
to
remain
undiscovered
in
my
real
character
and
sentiment
,
I
be
under
a
necessity
of
mortify
my
desire
of
praise
,
by
confine
my
work
to
my
own
perusal
and
applause
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
I
strove
to
insinuate
myself
into
the
good
opinion
of
both
lady
;
and
succeed
so
well
,
by
my
diligence
and
dutiful
behaviour
,
that
in
a
little
time
,
I
be
at
least
a
favourite
servant
;
and
frequently
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
hear
myself
mention
in
French
and
italian
,
with
some
degree
of
warmth
and
surprize
,
by
the
dear
object
of
all
my
wish
,
as
a
person
who
have
so
much
of
the
gentleman
in
my
appearance
and
discourse
,
that
she
could
not
for
her
soul
treat
me
like
a
common
lacquey
.
     
<EOS>
and
modesty
be
not
long
proof
against
these
bewitching
compliment
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
while
I
wait
at
dinner
,
the
conversation
turn
upon
a
knotty
passage
of
Tasso
's
Gierusalem
,
which
,
it
seem
,
have
puzzle
them
both
:
after
a
great
many
unsatisfactory
conjecture
,
my
mistress
take
the
book
out
of
her
pocket
,
turn
up
the
place
in
question
,
and
read
the
sentence
over
and
over
without
success
;
at
length
,
despair
of
find
the
author
's
meaning
,
she
turn
to
me
,
say
,
"
come
hither
,
Bruno
<EOS>
,
let
us
see
what
fortune
will
do
for
us
;
I
will
interpret
to
thee
what
go
before
and
what
follow
this
obscure
paragraph
,
the
particular
word
of
which
I
will
also
explain
,
that
thou
may'st
,
by
compare
one
with
another
,
guess
the
sense
of
that
which
perplex
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
too
vain
to
let
slip
this
opportunity
of
display
my
talent
,
therefore
,
without
hesitation
,
read
and
explain
the
whole
of
that
which
have
disconcert
them
,
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
Narcissa
's
face
and
lovely
neck
be
overspread
with
blush
,
from
whence
I
draw
a
favourable
oman
,
while
her
aunt
,
after
have
stare
at
me
a
good
while
with
a
look
of
amazement
,
exclaim
,
"
in
the
name
of
heaven
!
<EOS>
who
art
thou
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
have
pick
up
a
smattering
of
Italian
,
during
a
voyage
up
the
Straits
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
she
shake
her
head
,
and
observe
,
that
no
smatterer
could
read
as
I
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
desire
to
know
if
I
understand
French
,
to
which
I
answer
in
the
affirmative
<EOS>
:
She
ask
if
I
be
acquaint
with
the
latin
and
Greek
;
I
reply
,
"
a
little
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
(
continue
she
)
and
with
philosophy
and
mathematick
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
know
something
of
each
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
she
repeat
her
stare
and
interrogation
.
     
<EOS>
I
begin
to
repent
my
vanity
,
and
in
order
to
repair
the
fault
I
have
commit
,
say
,
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
if
I
have
a
tolerable
education
,
because
learning
be
so
cheap
in
my
country
,
that
every
peasant
be
a
scholar
;
but
I
hope
her
ladyship
would
think
my
understanding
no
exception
to
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
pleased
to
answer
,
"
no
,
no
,
God
forbid
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
during
the
rest
of
the
time
they
sit
at
table
,
they
behave
with
remarkable
reserve
.
    
<EOS>
this
alteration
give
me
much
uneasiness
;
and
I
pass
the
night
without
sleep
,
in
melancholy
reflection
on
the
vanity
of
young
man
,
which
prompt
them
to
commit
so
many
foolish
action
,
contrary
to
their
own
sober
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
however
,
instead
of
profit
by
this
self
-
condemnation
,
I
yield
still
more
to
the
dictate
of
the
principle
I
have
endeavour
to
chastize
,
and
if
fortune
have
not
befriend
me
more
than
prudence
could
expect
,
I
should
have
be
treat
with
the
contempt
I
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
my
lady
,
who
be
a
true
author
,
bid
me
follow
her
into
the
study
,
where
she
express
herself
thus
:
"
<EOS>
since
you
be
so
learned
,
you
can
not
be
void
of
taste
;
therefore
I
be
to
desire
your
opinion
of
a
small
performance
in
poetry
,
which
I
lately
compose
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
have
plan
a
tragedy
,
the
subject
of
which
shall
be
the
murder
of
a
prince
before
the
altar
,
where
he
be
busy
at
his
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
deed
be
perpetrate
,
the
regicide
will
harrangue
the
people
,
with
the
bloody
dagger
in
his
hand
;
and
I
have
already
compose
a
speech
,
which
I
think
will
suit
the
character
extremely
.
 
<EOS>
here
it
be
.
"
     
<EOS>
then

up

read
with
violent

I

my

I
drag
the
parent

the
hoary
hair

toss
the

my

regale
mine

<EOS>
Though
I
do
great
violence
to
my
understanding
in
praise
this
unnatural
rhapsody
,
I
nevertheless
extoll
it
as
a
production
that
of
itself
deserve
immortal
fame
;
and
beseech
her
ladyship
to
bless
the
world
with
the
fruit
of
those
uncommon

heaven
have
bestow
upon
her

She
smile
with

complacency

encourage
by
the
incense
I
have
offer
,
communicate
all
her
poetical
work

which
I
applaud
one
by
one
,
with
as
little
candour
as
I
have
shew
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
satiate
with
my
flattery
,
which
I
hope
my
situation
justify
,
she
could
not
in
conscience
refuse
me
an
opportunity
of
shine
in
my
turn
;
and
therefore
,
after
a
compliment
to
my
nice
discernment
and
taste
,
observe
,
that
doubtless
I
must
have
produce
something
in
that
way
myself
,
which
she
desire
to
see

<EOS>
this
be
a
temptation
I
could
by
no
means
resist

<EOS>
I
own
that
while
I
be
at
college
,
I
write
some
small
detached
piece
,
at
the
desire
of
a
friend
who
be
in
love

at
her
request

repeat
the

My

versification
,
which

she

,
be
elegant

the
subject
beneath

pen

<EOS>
I
be
extremely
nettle
at

at

by

that
if
their

it

probable
one

of
them
would
have
have
recourse

poison

to
be
revenge
of
her
rival

as

happily

their

scold

My

alarm
at

lay
their
head

me
defiance

offer
to
box
with
me
for
twenty
guinea

I
tell
him
,
that
although
I
believe
myself
a
match
for
him
,
even
at
that
work
,
I
would
not
descend
so
far
below
the
dignity
of
a
gentleman
,
as
to
fight
like
a
porter
;
but
if
he
have
any
thing

I

nay
more

that
if
he
give
his

any
more

liberty
at

I
would
crop
his

without

express
their

the
way

their
power

the
cook
entertain
me
with
choice
bit
,
the
dairy

maid
with
stroaking
;
the
first
would
often
encourage
me
to
declare
myself
,
by
compliment
me
upon
my
courage

learning
,
and
observe

that
if
she

she
could
make
a
great

that
many
a

would
be
glad
to

her

but
she
be
resolve
to
please
her
eye

if
she
should
plague
her
heart

<EOS>
then
she
would
launch
out
into
the
praise
of
my

person

and
say
,
she
be
sure
I
would
make
a
good
husband
,
for
I
be
very
good

natured

<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
uneasy
at
the
importunity
of
these
inamorata
,
whom
at
another
time
,
perhaps
,
I
may
have
please
without
the
disagreeable
sauce
of
matrimony

but
at

,
my
whole
soul
be
engross
by
Narcissa

I
could

I

lieutenant
Bowling

our

<EOS>
at
certain
interval
,
my

;
I
would
despise
myself
for
my
tame
resignation
to

fate

an

scheme

by
birth

<EOS>
in
these
fruitless
suggestion
,
time
steal
away
unperceived
,
and
I
have
already
remain
eight
month
in
the
station
of
a

when
an
accident

that
put
an
end
to

<EOS>
Narcissa
go
one
day
to

Miss

who

with

,
within
less
than
a
mile
of

,
and

to
walk
home
in
the
cool
of

who

a
good

instigate
to
use
some
unbecoming
familiarity
with
her
,

by
the
solitariness
of
a
field
through
which
they
pass
.
     
<EOS>
the
lovely
creature
be
incense
at
his
rude
behaviour
,
for
which
she
reproach
him
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
lose
all
regard
for
decency
,
and
actually
offer
violence
to
this
pattern
of
innocence
and
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
but
heaven
would
not
suffer
so
much
goodness
to
be
violate
;
and
send
me
,
who
pass
by
accident
near
the
place
,
<EOS>
be
alarm
with
her
cry
,
to
her
succour
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
emotion
of
my
soul
,
when
I
beheld
Narcissa
,
almost
sink
beneath
the
brutal
force
of
this
satyr
!
<EOS>
I
fly
like
lighten
to
her
rescue
,
which
he
perceive
,
quit
his
prey
,
and
draw
his
hanger
to
chastise
my
presumption
.
 
<EOS>
My
indignation
be
too
high
to
admit
one
thought
of
fear
,
so
that
rush
upon
him
,
I
strike
his
weapon
out
of
his
hand
,
and
use
my
cudgel
so
successfully
,
that
he
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
lie
,
to
all
appearance
,
without
sense
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
turn
to
Narcissa
,
who
have
swoon
,
and
sit
down
by
her
,
gently
raise
her
head
,
and
support
it
on
my
bosom
,
while
with
my
hand
around
her
waist
,
I
keep
her
in
that
position
.
<EOS>
My
soul
be
thrill
with
tumultuous
joy
,
at
feel
the
object
of
my
dear
wish
within
my
arm
;
and
while
she
lie
insensible
,
I
could
not
refrain
from
apply
my
cheek
to
her
's
,
and
ravish
a
kiss
:
in
a
little
time
,
the
blood
begin
to
revisit
her
face
,
she
open
her
enchanting
eye
,
and
have
recollect
her
late
situation
,
say
,
with
a
look
full
of
tender
acknowledgment
,
"
Dear
John
,
I
be
eternally
oblige
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
make
an
effort
to
rise
,
in
which
I
assist
her
,
and
she
proceed
to
the
house
,
lean
upon
me
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
thousand
time
tempt
by
this
opportunity
to
declare
my
passion
,
but
the
dread
of
disoblige
her
,
restrain
my
tongue
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
not
get
an
hundred
pace
from
the
scene
of
her
distress
,
when
I
perceive
Sir
Timothy
get
up
and
move
homeward
;
a
circumstance
,
which
,
though
it
give
me
some
satisfaction
,
in
as
much
as
I
thereby
know
I
have
not
kill
him
,
fill
me
with
just
apprehension
of
his
resentment
,
which
I
find
myself
in
no
condition
to
withstand
:
especially
when
I
consider
his
intimacy
with
our
"
Squire
,
to
whom
I
know
he
would
easily
justify
himself
for
what
he
have
do
,
by
impute
it
to
his
love
,
and
desire
his
brother
Bruin
to
take
the
same
liberty
with
his
sister
,
without
any
fear
of
offence
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
the
house
,
Narcissa
assure
me
,
she
would
exert
all
her
influence
in
protect
me
from
the
revenge
of
thicket
,
and
likewise
engage
her
aunt
in
my
favour
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
pull
out
her
purse
,
offer
it
as
a
small
consideration
for
the
service
I
have
do
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
stand
too
much
upon
the
punctilie
of
love
to
incur
the
least
suspicion
of
be
mercenary
,
and
refuse
the
present
,
say
,
I
have
merit
nothing
by
barely
do
my
duty
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
astonished
at
my
disinterestedness
,
and
blush
:
I
feel
the
same
suffusion
,
and
with
a
down
-
cast
eye
and
break
accent
,
tell
her
,
I
have
one
request
to
make
,
which
if
her
generosity
would
grant
,
I
should
think
myself
fully
recompense
for
an
age
of
misery
.
 
<EOS>
She
change
colour
at
this
preamble
,
and
with
great
confusion
,
reply
<EOS>
,
she
hope
my
good
sense
would
hinder
me
from
ask
any
thing
she
be
bind
in
honour
to
refuse
,
and
therefore
bid
me
signify
my
desire
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
I
kneel
,
and
beg
to
kiss
her
hand
.
    
<EOS>
She
immediately
,
with
an
averted
look
,
stretch
it
out
;
I
imprint
on
it
an
ardent
kiss
,
and
bathe
it
with
my
tear
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
Dear
Madam
,
I
be
an
unfortunate
gentleman
,
who
love
you
to
distraction
,
but
would
have
die
a
thousand
death
,
rather
than
make
this
declaration
under
such
a
servile
appearance
,
be
he
not
determined
to
yield
to
the
rigour
of
his
fate
,
to
fly
from
your
bewitching
presence
,
and
bury
his
presumptuous
passion
in
eternal
silence
.
<EOS>
"
with
these
word
I
rise
and
go
away
,
before
she
could
recover
her
spirit
so
far
as
to
make
any
reply
.
 
<EOS>
My
first
care
be
to
go
and
consult
Mrs
Sagely
,
with
whom
I
have
maintain
a
friendly
correspondence
ever
since
I
leave
her
house
.
<EOS>
when
she
understand
my
situation
,
the
good
woman
,
with
real
concern
,
condole
me
on
my
unhappy
fate
,
and
approve
of
my
resolution
to
leave
the
country
,
be
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
barbarous
disposition
of
my
rival
,
"
who
by
this
time
(
say
she
)
have
no
doubt
meditate
a
scheme
of
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
can
not
see
how
you
will
be
able
to
elude
his
vengeance
:
be
himself
in
the
commission
,
he
will
immediately
grant
warrant
for
apprehend
you
;
and
as
almost
all
the
people
in
this
country
be
dependant
on
him
or
his
friend
,
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
find
shelter
among
them
:
if
you
should
be
apprehend
,
he
will
commit
you
to
jail
,
where
you
may
possibly
languish
in
great
misery
till
the
next
assize
,
and
then
be
transport
for
assault
a
magistrate
.
"
     
<EOS>
while
she
thus
warn
me
of
my
danger
,
we
hear
a
knocking
at
the
door
,
which
throw
us
both
into
great
consternation
,
as
in
all
probability
,
it
be
occasion
by
my
pursuer
;
whereupon
this
generous
old
lady
,
put
two
guinea
into
my
hand
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
bid
me
,
for
God
's
sake
,
get
out
at
the
back
door
,
and
consult
my
safety
as
providence
should
direct
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
time
for
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
I
follow
her
advice
,
and
escape
by
the
benefit
of
a
dark
night
,
to
the
sea
-
side
,
where
while
I
ruminate
on
my
next
excursion
,
I
be
all
of
a
sudden
surround
by
armed
man
,
who
,
have
bind
my
hand
and
foot
,
bid
me
make
no
noise
,
on
pain
of
be
shoot
,
and
carry
me
on
board
of
a
vessel
,
which
I
soon
perceive
to
be
a
smuggling
cutter
.
 
<EOS>
this
discovery
give
me
some
satisfaction
at
first
,
because
I
conclude
myself
safe
from
the
resentment
of
Sir
Timothy
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
find
myself
in
the
hand
of
ruffian
,
who
threatne
to
execute
me
for
a
spy
,
I
would
have
think
myself
happily
quit
for
a
year
's
imprisonment
,
or
even
transportation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
me
to
protest
my
innocence
:
I
could
not
persuade
them
that
I
have
take
a
solitary
walk
to
their
haunt
,
at
such
an
hour
,
merely
for
my
own
amusement
;
and
I
do
not
think
it
my
interest
to
disclose
the
true
cause
of
my
retreat
,
because
I
be
afraid
they
would
have
make
their
peace
with
justice
by
surrender
me
to
the
penalty
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
what
confirm
their
suspicion
be
,
the
appearance
of
a
Custom
-
house
yacht
,
which
give
them
chace
,
and
have
well
-
nigh
make
a
prize
of
their
vessel
;
when
they
be
deliver
from
their
fear
by
a
thick
fog
,
which
effectually
screen
them
,
and
favour
their
arrival
at
Buloign
.
     
<EOS>
but
before
they
get
out
of
fight
of
their
pursuer
,
they
hold
a
council
of
war
about
me
,
whom
some
of
the
most
ferocious
among
them
,
would
have
throw
overboard
,
as
a
traitor
who
have
betray
them
to
their
enemy
;
but
other
more
considerate
,
alledge
,
that
if
they
put
me
to
death
,
and
should
afterwards
be
take
,
they
could
expect
no
mercy
from
the
legislature
,
which
would
never
pardon
outlawry
aggravate
by
murder
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
determine
by
a
plurality
of
vote
,
that
I
should
be
set
on
shore
in
France
,
and
leave
to
find
my
passage
back
to
England
,
as
I
should
think
proper
,
which
would
be
punishment
sufficient
for
the
bare
suspicion
of
a
crime
in
itself
not
capital
.
 
<EOS>
although
this
favourable
determination
give
me
great
pleasure
,
the
apprehension
of
be
rob
would
not
suffer
me
to
be
perfectly
at
ease
:
to
prevent
this
calamity
,
as
soon
as
I
be
untie
,
in
consequence
of
the
foresaid
decision
,
I
tear
a
small
hole
in
one
of
my
stocking
,
into
which
I
drop
six
guinea
,
reserve
half
a
piece
and
some
silver
in
my
pocket
,
that
find
something
,
they
may
not
be
tempt
to
make
any
further
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
necessary
precaution
,
for
when
we
come
within
sight
of
the
french
shore
,
one
of
the
smuggler
tell
me
,
I
must
pay
for
my
passage
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
I
reply
,
that
my
passage
be
none
of
my
own
seeking
;
therefore
they
could
not
expect
a
reward
from
me
for
transport
me
into
a
strange
country
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damme
!
<EOS>
(
say
the
outlaw
)
none
of
your
palaver
;
but
let
me
see
what
money
you
have
get
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
thrust
his
hand
into
my
pocket
without
any
ceremony
,
and
empty
it
of
the
content
:
<EOS>
then
cast
an
eye
at
my
hat
and
wig
,
which
captivate
his
fancy
,
he
take
them
off
,
and
clap
his
own
on
my
head
,
declare
,
that
a
fair
exchange
be
no
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
fain
to
put
up
with
the
bargain
,
which
be
by
no
mean
favourable
to
me
;
and
a
little
while
after
we
go
all
on
shore
together
.
    
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
take
my
leave
of
these
desperado
,
without
much
ceremony
,
when
one
of
them
caution
me
against
appear
to
their
prejudice
if
ever
I
return
to
England
,
unless
I
have
a
mind
to
be
murder
;
for
which
service
,
he
assure
me
,
the
gang
never
want
agent
.
 
<EOS>
I
promise
to
observe
his
advice
,
and
depart
for
the
Upper
Town
,
where
I
enquire
for
a
cabaret
or
publick
-
house
,
into
which
I
go
,
with
an
intention
of
take
some
refreshment
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
kitchin
,
five
dutch
sailor
sit
at
breakfast
,
with
a
large
loaf
,
a
firkin
of
butter
,
and
a
cag
of
brandy
on
the
table
,
the
bung
of
which
they
often
apply
to
their
mouth
with
great
perseverance
and
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
at
some
distance
from
them
,
I
perceive
another
person
in
the
same
garb
,
sit
in
a
pensive
solitary
manner
,
entertain
himself
with
a
whiff
of
tobacco
,
from
the
stump
of
a
pipe
,
as
black
as
jet
.
 
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
distress
never
fail
to
attract
my
regard
and
compassion
;
I
approach
this
forlorn
tar
,
with
a
view
to
offer
him
my
assistance
,
and
notwithstanding
the
alteration
of
dress
,
and
disguise
of
a
long
hear
,
I
discover
in
him
my
long
lose
and
lament
uncle
and
benefactor
,
lieutenant
Bowling
!
<EOS>
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
agitation
of
my
soul
,
between
the
joy
of
find
again
such
a
valuable
friend
,
and
the
sorrow
of
see
him
in
such
a
low
condition
!
<EOS>
the
tear
gush
down
my
cheek
,
I
stand
motionless
and
silent
for
some
time
;
at
length
,
recover
the
use
of
speech
,
exclaim
,
"
Gracious
God
!
<EOS>
Mr
Bowling
!
"
     
<EOS>
My
uncle
no
sooner
hear
his
name
mention
,
than
he
start
up
,
cry
with
some
surprize
,
"
Holloa
!
"
<EOS>
and
after
have
look
at
me
stedfastly
,
without
be
able
to
recollect
me
,
say
,
"
do
you
call
me
,
brother
?
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
,
I
have
something
extraordinary
to
communicate
,
and
desire
him
to
give
me
a
few
minute
hear
in
another
room
;
but
he
would
by
no
means
consent
to
this
proposal
,
say
,
"
Avast
there
,
friend
;
none
of
your
trick
upon
traveller
;
 
if
you
have
any
thing
to
say
to
me
,
do
it
above
-
board
;
 
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
be
over
-
hear
;
 
here
be
none
who
understand
our
lingo
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
though
I
be
loath
to
discover
myself
before
company
,
I
could
no
longer
refrain
from
tell
him
<EOS>
,
I
be
his
own
nephew
Roderick
Random
.
<EOS>
on
this
information
,
he
consider
me
with
great
earnestness
and
astonishment
,
and
recall
my
feature
,
which
though
enlarge
be
not
entirely
alter
since
he
have
see
me
,
come
up
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
very
cordially
,
protest
he
be
glad
to
see
me
well
.
<EOS>
after
some
pause
,
he
go
on
thus
:
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
my
lad
,
I
be
sorry
to
see
you
under
such
colour
;
the
more
so
,
as
it
be
not
in
my
power
,
at
present
,
to
change
them
for
the
well
,
times
be
very
hard
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
these
word
I
could
perceive
a
tear
trickle
down
his
furrowed
cheek
,
which
affect
me
so
much
,
that
I
weep
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
imagine
my
sorrow
be
the
effect
of
my
own
misfortune
,
he
comfort
me
,
by
observe
,
that
life
be
a
voyage
in
which
we
must
expect
to
meet
with
all
weather
;
sometimes
it
be
calm
,
sometimes
rough
;
that
a
fair
gale
often
succeed
a
storm
;
that
the
wind
do
not
always
sit
one
way
,
and
that
despair
signify
nothing
;
but
resolution
and
skill
be
well
than
a
stout
vessel
:
<EOS>
for
why
?
<EOS>
because
they
require
no
carpenter
,
and
grow
strong
the
more
labour
they
undergo
.
    
<EOS>
I
dry
up
my
tear
,
which
I
assure
him
,
be
not
shed
for
my
own
distress
,
but
for
his
,
and
beg
leave
to
accompany
him
into
another
room
,
where
we
could
converse
more
at
our
ease
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
recount
to
him
the
ungenerous
usage
I
have
meet
with
from
Potion
;
at
which
he
start
up
,
stalk
across
the
room
three
or
four
time
,
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
grasp
his
cudgel
,
cry
,
"
I
would
I
be
along
-
side
of
him
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
 
<EOS>
I
would
<EOS>
I
be
along
-
side
of
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
then
give
him
a
detail
of
all
my
adventure
and
suffering
,
which
affect
him
more
than
I
could
have
imagine
;
and
conclude
with
tell
him
that
captain
Oakhum
be
still
alive
,
and
that
he
may
return
to
England
when
he
would
,
to
sollicite
his
affair
,
without
danger
or
molestation
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
wonderfully
pleased
at
this
piece
of
information
,
of
which
however
,
he
say
he
could
not
at
present
avail
himself
,
for
want
of
money
to
pay
for
his
passage
to
London
.
<EOS>
this
objection
I
soon
remove
,
by
put
five
guinea
into
his
hand
,
and
tell
him
,
I
think
myself
extremely
happy
in
have
an
opportunity
of
manifest
my
gratitude
to
him
in
his
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
with
the
utmost
difficulty
I
could
prevail
upon
him
to
accept
of
two
,
which
he
affirm
,
<EOS>
be
more
than
sufficient
to
defray
the
necessary
expence
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
friendly
contest
be
over
,
he
propose
we
should
have
a
mess
of
something
:
"
for
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
it
have
be
banyan
day
with
me
a
great
while
.
     
<EOS>
You
must
know
I
be
shipwreck
five
day
ago
,
near
a
place
call
Lisieux
,
in
company
with
these
dutchman
who
be
now
drink
below
;
and
have
but
little
money
when
I
come
ashore
,
it
be
soon
spend
,
because
I
let
them
have
share
and
share
while
it
last
.
 
<EOS>
Howsomever
,
I
should
have
remembre
the
old
saying
,
every
hog
his
own
apple
:
for
when
they
find
my
hold
unstowed
,
they
go
all
hand
to
shoole
and
beg
;
and
because
I
would
not
take
a
spell
at
the
same
duty
,
refuse
to
give
me
the
least
assistance
;
so
that
I
have
not
break
bread
these
two
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
shock
at
the
extremity
of
his
distress
,
and
order
some
bread
,
cheese
and
wine
to
be
bring
immediately
,
to
allay
his
hunger
,
until
a
fricassee
of
chicken
could
be
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
recruit
his
spirit
with
this
homely
fare
,
I
desire
to
know
the
particular
of
his
peregrination
,
since
the
accident
at
Cape
Tiberoon
;
which
be
briefly
these
:
the
money
he
have
about
him
be
all
spend
at
Port
Louis
,
the
civility
and
hospitality
of
the
French
cool
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
be
oblige
to
list
on
board
of
one
of
their
king
's
ship
,
as
a
common
fore
-
mast
-
man
,
to
prevent
himself
from
starve
on
shore
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
situation
,
he
continue
two
year
,
during
which
time
he
have
acquire
some
knowledge
of
their
language
,
and
the
reputation
of
a
good
seaman
:
    
<EOS>
the
ship
he
belong
to
be
order
home
to
old
France
,
where
she
be
lay
up
as
unfit
for
service
,
and
he
be
receive
on
board
of
one
of
monsieur
<EOS>
D'Antin
's
squadron
,
in
quality
of
quarter
-
master
;
which
office
he
perform
in
a
voyage
to
the
West
-
Indies
,
where
they
engage
with
our
ship
,
as
before
relate
;
but
his
conscience
upbraid
him
for
serve
the
enemy
of
his
country
,
he
quit
the
ship
at
the
same
place
where
he
first
list
,
and
get
to
Currasoa
in
a
dutch
vessel
;
there
he
bargain
with
another
skipper
,
bind
to
Europe
,
to
work
for
his
passage
to
Holland
,
from
whence
he
be
in
hope
of
hear
from
his
friend
in
England
;
but
be
cast
away
,
as
he
mention
before
,
on
the
french
coast
,
and
must
have
be
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
travel
on
foot
to
Holland
,
and
beg
for
his
subsistence
on
the
road
,
or
of
enter
on
board
of
another
french
man
of
war
,
at
the
hazard
of
be
treat
as
a
deserter
,
if
Providence
have
not
send
me
to
his
succour
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
my
lad
,
(
continue
he
)
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
steer
my
course
directly
to
London
,
where
I
do
not
doubt
of
be
replace
,
and
of
have
the
r
take
off
me
by
the
lord
of
the
admiralty
,
to
whom
I
intend
to
write
a
petition
set
forth
my
case
:
if
I
succeed
,
I
will
have
wherewithal
to
give
you
some
assistance
,
because
when
I
leave
the
ship
I
have
two
year
pay
due
to
me
;
therefore
I
desire
to
know
whither
you
be
bind
;
and
beside
,
perhaps
,
I
may
have
interest
enough
to
procure
a
warrant
appoint
you
surgeon
's
mate
of
the
ship
to
which
I
shall
belong
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
beadle

the
admiralty
be
my
good
friend
;
and
he
and
one
of
the
under
-
clerk
be
swear
brother
,
and
that
under
-
clerk
have
a
good
deal
to
say
with
one
of
the
upper
-
clerk
,
who
be
very
well
known
to
the
under
-
secretary
,
who
,
upon
his
recommendation
,
I
hope
will
recommend
my
affair
to
the
first
secretary
;
and
he
again
,
will
speak
to
one
of
the
Lords
in
my
behalf
:
so
that
you
see
,
I
do
not
want
friend
to
assist
me
on
occasion
.
     
<EOS>
as
for
the
fellowr
Crampley
,
tho'f
<EOS>
I
know
him
<EOS>
not
,
I
be
sure
he
be
neither
sea
-
man
nor
officer
,
by
what
you
have
tell
me
,
or
else
he
could
never
be
so
much
mistaken
in
his
reckoning
,
as
to
run
the
ship
on
shore
on
the
coast
of
Sussex
,
before
he
believe
himself
in
sounding
;
neither
,
when
that
accident
happen
,
would
he
have
leave
the
ship
until
she
have
be
stave
to
piece
,
especially
when
the
tide
be
make
;
<EOS>
wherefore
,
by
this
time
,
I
do
suppose
he
have
be
try
by
a
court
-
martial
and
execute
for
his
cowardice
and
misconduct
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smile
at
the
description
of
my
uncle
's
ladder
,
by
which
he
propose
to
clime
to
the
attention
of
the
board
of
admiralty
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
I
know
the
world
too
well
,
to
confide
in
such
dependance
myself
,
I
would
not
discourage
him
with
doubt
;
but
ask
if
he
have
no
friend
in
London
,
who
would
advance
a
small
sum
of
money
to
enable
him
to
appear
as
he
ought
,
and
make
a
small
present
to
the
under
secretary
,
who
may
possibly
dispatch
his
business
the
sooner
on
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
He
scratch
his
head
,
and
after
some
recollection
,
reply
,
"
why
,
yes
,
I
believe
Daniel
Whipcord
<EOS>
the
ship
-
chandler
in
Wapping
would
not
refuse
me
such
a
small
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
can
have
what
credit
<EOS>
I
would
,
for
lodging
,
liquor
and
cloath
;
but
as
to
money
,
I
will
not
be
positive
:
 
have
honest
Block
be
live
,
I
should
not
have
be
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
sorry
to
find
a
worthy
man
so
destitute
of
friend
,
when
he
have
such
need
of
them
;
and
look
upon
my
own
situation
as
less
miserable
than
his
,
because
I
be
better
acquaint
with
the
selfishness
and
roguery
of
mankind
;
consequently
less
liable
to
disappointment
and
imposition

in

for
Paris
 
<EOS>
the
character
of
my
fellow
-
traveller
 
an
adventure
on
the
road
 
<EOS>
I
be
shock
at
his
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
when
our
repast
be
end
,
we
walk
down
to
the
harbour
,
where
we
find
a
Cutter
that
be
to
sail
for
Deal
in
the
evening
,
and
Mr
Bowling
agree
for
his
passage
:
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
we
saunter
about
the
town
,
to
satisfy
our
curiosity
,
our
conversation
turn
on
the
subject
of
my
design
,
which
be
not
as
yet
fix
:
neither
can
it
be
suppose
,
that
my
mind
be
at
ease
,
when
I
find
myself
reduce
almost
to
extreme
poverty
,
in
the
midst
of
foreigner
,
among
whom
I
have
not
one
acquaintance
to
advise
or
befriend
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
sensible
of
my
forlorn
condition
,
and
press
me
to
accompany
him
to
England
,
where
he
do
not
doubt
of
find
some
sort
of
provision
for
me
:
    
but
besides
the
other
reason
I
have
for
avoid
that
kingdom
,
I
look
upon
it
,
at
this
time
,
as
the
bad
country
in
the
universe
for
a
poor
honest
man
to
live
in
;
and
therefore
determine
to
remain
in
France
,
coute
que
coute
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
confirm
in
this
resolution
,
by
a
reverend
priest
,
who
pass
by
at
this
time
,
and
overhear
us
speak
English
,
accost
us
in
the
same
language
,
tell
us
he
be
our
countryman
,
and
wish
it
may
be
in
his
power
to
do
us
any
service
<EOS>
:
We
thank
this
grave
person
for
his
courteous
offer
,
and
invite
him
to
drink
a
glass
with
us
,
which
he
do
not
think
proper
to
refuse
,
and
we
go
all
together
into
a
tavern
of
his
recommending
.
<EOS>
after
have
drink
to
our
health
in
a
bumper
of
good
Burgundy
,
he
begin
to
enquire
into
our
situation
,
and
ask
particularly
the
place
of
our
nativity
,
which
we
no
sooner
name
,
than
he
start
up
,
and
wring
our
hand
with
great
fervour
,
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
cry
,
"
I
come
from
the
same
part
of
the
country
!
<EOS>
perhaps
you
be
my
own
relation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
on
my
guard
against
his
caress
,
which
I
suspect
very
much
,
when
I
remember
the
adventure
of
the
money
-
dropper
;
but
without
any
appearance
of
diffidence
,
observe
,
that
as
he
be
bear
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
he
must
certainly
know
our
family
,
which
(
howsoever
mean
our
present
appearance
may
be
)
be
none
of
the
most
obscure
and
inconsiderable
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
discover
our
name
,
to
which
I
find
he
be
no
stranger
;
he
have
know
my
grandfather
personally
;
and
notwithstanding
an
absence
of
fifty
year
from
Scotland
,
recount
so
many
particular
of
the
family
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
my
scruple
be
entirely
remove
,
and
I
think
myself
happy
in
his
acquaintance
.
     
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
I
disclose
my
condition
without
reserve
,
and
display
my
talent
to
such
advantage
,
that
the
old
father
look
upon
me
with
admiration
,
and
assure
me
,
that
if
I
stay
in
France
,
and
listen
to
reason
,
I
could
not
fail
of
make
my
fortune
,
to
which
he
would
contribute
all
in
his
power
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
begin
to
be
jealous
of
the
priest
's
insinuation
,
and
very
abruptly
declare
,
that
if
ever
I
should
renounce
my
religion
,
he
would
break
off
all
connexion
and
correspondence
with
me
;
for
it
be
his
opinion
,
that
no
honest
man
would
swerve
from
the
principle
in
which
he
be
breed
,
whether
turkish
,
protestant
or
Roman
.
 
<EOS>
the
father
,
affront
at
this
declaration
,
with
great
vehemence
,
begin
a
long
discourse
,
set
forth
the
danger
of
obstinacy
,
and
shut
one
's
eye
against
the
light
:
<EOS>
He
say
,
that
ignorance
would
be
no
plea
towards
justification
,
when
we
have
opportunity
of
be
better
inform
;
and
that
,
if
the
mind
of
people
have
not
be
open
to
conviction
,
the
christian
religion
would
not
have
be
propagate
in
the
world
;
and
we
should
now
be
in
a
state
of
pagan
darkness
and
barbarity
:
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
prove
,
by
some
text
of
scripture
,
and
many
quotation
from
the
father
,
that
the
Pope
be
the
successor
of
St
Peter
,
and
vicar
of
Jesus
Christ
;
that
the
church
of
Rome
be
the
true
,
holy
,
catholick
church
;
and
that
the
protestant
faith
be
an
impious
heresy
,
and
damnable
schism
,
by
which
many
million
of
soul
would
suffer
everlasting
perdition
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
his
sermon
,
which
I
think
,
he
pronounce
with
more
zeal
than
discretion
,
he
address
himself
to
my
uncle
,
and
desire
to
know
his
objection
to
what
have
be
say
.
    
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
whose
attention
have
be
wholly
engross
by
his
own
affair
,
take
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
reply
,
"
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
friend
,
d'ye
see
,
I
have
no
objection
to
what
you
say
,
it
may
be
either
true
or
false
,
for
what
I
know
;
I
meddle
with
no
body
's
affair
but
my
own
;
the
gunner
to
his
linstock
,
and
the
steersman
to
the
helm
,
as
the
saying
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
to
no
creed
but
the
compass
,
and
do
unto
every
man
as
I
would
be
do
by
;
so
that
I
defy
the
pope
,
the
devil
,
and
the
pretender
;
and
hope
to
be
save
as
well
as
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
association
of
person
give
great
offence
to
the
friar
,
who
protest
,
in
a
mighty
passion
,
that
if
Mr
Bowling
have
not
be
his
countryman
,
he
would
have
cause
him
to
be
imprison
for
his
insolence
.
 
<EOS>
I
venture
to
disapprove
of
my
uncle
's
rashness
,
and
appease
the
old
gentleman
,
by
assure
him
,
there
be
no
offence
intend
by
my
kinsman
,
who
by
this
time
,
sensible
of
his
error
,
shake
the
injure
party
by
the
hand
,
and
ask
pardon
for
the
freedom
he
have
take
.
 
<EOS>
matter
be
amicably
compromise
,
he
invite
us
to
come
and
see
him
in
the
afternoon
at
the
convent
to
which
he
belong
,
and
take
his
leave
for
the
present
;
when
my
uncle
recommend
it
strongly
to
me
to
persevere
in
the
religion
of
my
forefather
,
whatever
advantage
I
may
propose
to
my
self
by
a
change
,
which
could
not
fail
of
disgrace
myself
,
and
dishonour
my
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
no
consideration
should
induce
me
to
forfeit
his
friendship
and
good
opinion
,
on
that
score
;
at
which
he
discover
great
satisfaction
,
and
put
me
in
mind
of
dinner
,
which
we
immediately
bespoke
,
and
when
it
be
ready
eat
together
.
    
<EOS>
I
imagine
my
acquaintance
with
the
Scottish
Priest
,
if
properly
manage
,
may
turn
out
to
my
advantage
,
and
therefore
resolve
to
cultivate
it
as
much
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
we
visit
him
at
his
convent
,
accord
to
his
invitation
,
where
he
treat
us
with
wine
and
sweet
-
meat
,
and
shew
us
every
thing
that
be
remarkable
in
the
monastery
.
 
<EOS>
have
be
thus
entertain
,
we
take
our
leave
,
though
not
before
I
have
promise
to
see
him
next
day
;
and
the
time
fix
for
my
uncle
's
embarking
be
come
,
I
accompany
him
to
the
harbour
,
and
see
him
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
We
part
not
without
tear
,
after
we
have
embrace
and
wish
one
another
all
manner
of
prosperity
;
and
he
intreate
me
to
write
to
him
often
,
direct
to
lieutenant
Thomas
Bowling
,
at
the
sign
of
the
Union
flag
,
near
the
Hermitage
,
London
.
    
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
house
in
which
we
have
meet
,
where
I
pass
the
night
in
a
very
solitary
manner
,
reflect
on
the
severity
of
my
fate
,
and
endeavour
to
project
some
likely
scheme
of
life
for
the
future
;
but
my
invention
fail
me
<EOS>
,
I
see
nothing
but
unsurmountable
difficulty
in
my
way
,
and
be
ready
to
despair
at
the
miserable
prospect
!
<EOS>
that
I
may
not
,
however
,
neglect
any
probable
mean
,
I
get
up
in
the
morning
,
and
go
directly
to
the
father
,
whose
advice
and
assistance
I
implore
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
me
very
kindly
,
and
give
me
to
understand
,
that
there
be
one
way
of
life
in
which
a
person
of
my
talent
could
not
fail
of
make
a
great
figure
.
     
<EOS>
I
guess
his
meaning
,
and
tell
him
once
for
all
,
I
be
fully
determine
against
any
alteration
in
point
of
religion
,
therefore
if
his
proposal
regard
the
church
,
he
may
save
himself
the
trouble
of
explain
it
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
and
sigh
,
say
,
"
ah
!
<EOS>
son
,
son
,
what
a
glorious
prospect
be
here
spoil
,
by
your
stubborn
prejudice
!
<EOS>
suffer
yourself
to
be
persuade
by
reason
,
and
consult
your
temporal
welfare
,
as
well
as
the
concern
of
your
eternal
soul
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
,
by
my
interest
,
procure
your
admission
as
a
noviciate
into
this
convent
,
where
I
will
superintend
and
direct
you
with
a
truly
paternal
affection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
launch
out
into
the
praise
of
a
monastic
life
,
which
no
noise
disturb
,
no
care
mol
,
and
no
danger
invades
 
where
the
heart
be
wean
from
carnal
attachment
,
the
gross
appetite
subdue
and
chastise
,
and
the
soul
waste
to
the
divine
region
of
philosophy
and
truth
,
on
the
wing
of
studious
contemplation
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
eloquence
be
lose
upon
me
,
whom
two
consideration
enable
to
withstand
his
temptation
;
namely
,
my
promise
to
my
uncle
,
and
my
aversion
to
an
ecclesiastical
life
;
for
as
to
the
difference
of
religion
,
I
look
upon
it
as
a
thing
of
too
small
moment
to
come
in
competition
with
a
man
's
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
find
me
immoveable
on
this
head
,
he
tell
me
,
he
be
more
sorry
than
offend
at
my
noncompliance
,
and
still
ready
to
employ
his
good
office
in
my
behalf
.
     
<EOS>
"
the
same
erroneous
maxim
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
that
obstruct
your
promotion
in
the
church
,
will
infallibly
prevent
your
advancement
in
the
army
;
but
if
you
can
brook
the
condition
of
a
servant
,
I
be
acquaint
with
some
people
of
rank
at
Versailles
,
to
whom
I
can
give
you
letter
of
recommendation
,
that
you
may
be
entertain
by
some
one
of
them
,
in
quality
of
maitre
d'hotel
;
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
your
qualification
will
soon
entitle
you
to
a
well
provision
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
embrace
his
offer
with
great
eagerness
;
and
he
appoint
me
to
come
back
in
the
afternnoon
,
when
he
would
not
only
give
me
the
letter
,
but
likewise
introduce
me
to
a
capuchin
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
intend
to
set
out
for
Paris
next
morning
,
in
whose
company
I
may
travel
,
without
be
at
the
expence
of
one
livre
during
the
whole
journey
.
<EOS>
this
piece
of
good
news
give
me
infinite
pleasure
;
I
acknowledge
my
obligation
to
the
benevolent
father
,
in
the
most
grateful
expression
;
and
he
perform
his
promise
to
a
tittle
,
in
deliver
the
letter
,
and
make
me
acquaint
with
the
capuchin
,
with
whom
I
depart
next
morning
by
break
of
day
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
I
discover
my
fellow
-
traveller
to
be
a
merry
facetious
fellow
,
who
,
notwithstanding
his
profession
and
appearance
of
mortification
,
love
good
eating
and
drink
better
than
his
rosary
,
and
pay
more
adoration
to
a
pretty
girl
than
to
the
Virgin
Mary
,
or
St
Genevive
.

He
be
a
thick
brawny
young
man
,
with
red
eye
-
brow
,
a
hook
nose
,
a
face
cover
with
freckle
;
and
<EOS>
his
name
be
Frere
Balthazar
.
<EOS>
His
order
do
not
permit
him
to
wear
linnen
,
so
that
have
little
occasion
to
undress
himself
,
he
be
none
of
the
cleanly
animal
in
the
world
;
and
his
constitution
be
naturally
so
strong
scented
,
that
I
always
think
it
convenient
to
keep
to
the
windward
of
him
in
our
march
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
perfectly
well
known
on
the
road
,
we
fare
sumptuously
without
any
cost
,
and
the
fatigue
of
our
journey
be
much
alleviate
by
the
good
humour
of
my
companion
,
who
sing
an
infinite
number
of
catch
on
the
subject
of
love
and
wine
.
     
<EOS>
We
take
up
our
lodge
the
first
night
at
a
peasant
's
house
,
not
far
from
Abbe
Ville
,
where
we
be
entertain
with
an
excellent
ragout
,
cook
by
our
landlord
's
daughter
,
one
of
whom
be
very
handsome
:
after
have
eat
heartily
,
and
drank
a
sufficient
quantity
of
vin
du
Pais
,
we
be
conduct
to
a
barn
,
where
we
find
a
couple
of
carpet
spread
upon
clean
straw
for
our
reception
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
lain
in
this
situation
above
half
an
hour
,
when
we
hear
somebody
knock
softly
at
the
door
,
upon
which
Balthazar
get
up
,
and
let
in
our
host
's
two
daughter
,
who
want
to
have
some
private
conversation
with
him
in
the
dark
;
when
they
have
whisper
together
some
time
,
the
capuchin
come
to
me
,
and
ask
if
I
be
insensible
to
love
,
or
so
hard
-
hearted
as
to
refuse
a
share
of
my
bed
to
a
pretty
maid
,
who
have
a
tendresse
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
own
,
to
my
shame
,
that
I
suffer
myself
to
be
overcome
by
my
passion
,
and
with
great
eagerness
seize
the
occasion
,
when
I
understand
that
the
amiable
Nanette
be
to
be
my
bedfellow
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
do
my
reason
suggest
the
respect
I
owe
to
my
dear
mistress
Narcissa
;
the
idea
of
that
lovely
charmer
,
rather
increase
than
allay
the
ferment
of
my
spirit
;
and
the
young
Paisanne
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
,
the
kind
creature
leave
us
to
our
repose
,
which
last
till
eight
o'clock
,
when
we
get
up
,
and
be
treat
at
breakfast
with
chocolate
and
l
'
eau
de
vie
,
by
our
paramour
,
of
whom
we
take
a
tender
leave
,
after
my
companion
have
confess
and
give
them
absolution
.
     
<EOS>
while
we
proceed
on
our
journey
,
the
conversation
turn
upon
the
night
's
adventure
,
be
introduce
by
the
capuchin
,
who
ask
me
how
I
like
my
lodging
:
<EOS>
I
declare
my
satisfaction
,
and
talk
in
rapture
of
the
agreeable
nanette
;
at
which
he
shake
his
head
,
and
smile
say
,
she
be
a
morceau
pour
la
bonne
bouche
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
value
myself
(
continue
he
)
upon
any
thing
so
much
as
the
conquest
of
Nanette
;
and
,
vanity
apart
,
I
have
be
pretty
fortunate
in
my
amours
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
information
shock
me
not
a
little
,
as
I
be
well
convinced
of
his
intimacy
with
her
sister
;
and
though
I
do
not
care
to
tax
him
with
downright
incest
,
I
profess
my
astonishment
at
his
last
night
's
choice
,
when
,
I
suppose
,
the
other
be
at
his
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
he
answer
,
that
besides
his
natural
complaisance
to
the
sex
,
he
have
another
reason
to
distribute
his
favour
equally
between
them
;
namely
,
to
preserve
peace
in
the
family
,
which
could
not
otherwise
be
maintain
;
 
that
moreover
Nanette
have
conceive
an
affection
for
me
,
and
he
love
her
too
well
to
baulk
her
inclination
;
more
especially
,
when
he
have
an
opportunity
of
oblige
his
friend
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
this
instance
of
his
friendship
,
though
I
be
extremely
disgusted
at
his
want
of
delicacy
,
and
curse
the
occasion
that
throw
me
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
Libertine
as
I
be
,
I
could
not
bear
to
see
a
man
behave
so
wide
of
the
character
he
assume
:
I
look
upon
him
as
person
of
very
little
worth
or
honesty
,
and
should
have
even
keep
a
wary
eye
upon
my
pocket
,
if
I
have
think
he
could
have
any
temptation
to
steal
.
     
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
conceive
the
use
of
money
to
a
capuchin
,
who
be
oblige
,
by
the
rule
of
his
order
,
to
appear
like
a
beggar
,
and
enjoy
all
other
necessary
of
life
gratis
;
<EOS>
besides
,
my
fellow
-
traveller
seem
to
be
of
a
complexion
too
careless
and
sanguine
,
to
give
me
any
apprehension
on
that
score
;
so
that
I
proceed
with
great
confidence
,
in
expectation
of
be
soon
at
my
journey
's
end

We

I

without

I

<EOS>

<EOS>
I

the
fatigue
of
the

almost
intolerable

with
my
comrade
in
a
dispute
upon
politick
 
<EOS>
he
challenge
me
to
the
field
,
wound
and
disarm
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
night
of
our
pilgrimage
,
we
pass
at
a
house
near
Amiens
,
where
Balthazar
be
unknown
,
we
sup
upon
indifferent
fare
,
and
sower
wine
,
and
be
fain
to
lie
in
a
garret
upon
an
old
mattrass
,
which
,
I
believe
,
have
be
in
the
possession
of
ten
thousand
myriad
of
flea
,
time
out
of
mind
.
     
<EOS>
We
do
not
invade
their
territory
with
impunity
;
in
less
than
a
minute
we
be
attack
with
sting
innumerable
,
in
spite
of
which
,
however
,
I
fall
fast
asleep
,
be
excessively
fatigue
with
our
day
's
march
,
and
do
not
wake
till
nine
next
morning
,
when
,
see
myself
alone
,
I
start
up
in
a
terrible
fright
,
and
examine
my
pocket
,
find
my
presaging
fear
too
true
!
<EOS>
My
companion
have
make
free
with
my
cash
,
and
leave
me
to
seek
my
way
to
Paris
by
myself
!
<EOS>
I
run
down
stair
immediately
;
and
with
a
look
full
of
grief
and
amazement
,
enquire
for
the
mendicant
,
who
,
they
give
me
to
understand
,
have
set
out
four
hour
before
,
after
have
tell
them
,
I
be
a
little
indisposed
,
and
desire
I
may
not
be
disturb
,
but
be
inform
when
I
should
wake
he
have
take
the
road
to
Noyons
,
where
he
would
wait
for
my
coming
,
at
the
Coq
<EOS>
D'Or
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
not
a
word
,
but
with
a
heavy
heart
,
direct
my
course
to
that
place
,
at
which
I
arrive
in
the
afternoon
,
faint
with
weariness
and
hunger
;
but
learn
,
to
my
utter
confusion
,
that
no
such
person
have
be
there
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
happy
for
me
that
I
have
a
good
deal
of
resentment
in
my
constitution
,
which
animate
me
on
such
occasion
,
against
the
villainy
of
mankind
,
and
enable
me
to
bear
misfortune
otherwise
intolerable
.
 
<EOS>
boil
with
indignation
,
I
discover
to
the
host
my
deplorable
condition
,
and
inveigh
with
great
bitterness
against
the
treachery
of
Balthazar
;
at
which
he
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
and
with
a
peculiar
grimace
on
his
countenance
,
say
,
he
be
sorry
for
my
misfortune
;
but
there
be
no
remedy
like
patience
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
some
guest
arrive
,
to
whom
he
hasten
to
offer
his
service
,
leave
me
mortify
at
his
indifference
,
and
fully
persuade
that
an
inn
-
keeper
be
the
same
sordid
animal
all
over
the
world
.
     
<EOS>
while
I
stand
in
the
porch
,
forlorn
and
undetermined
,
vent
ejaculation
of
curse
against
the
thief
who
have
rob
me
,
and
the
old
priest
who
recommend
him
to
my
friendship
;
a
young
gentleman
richly
dress
,
attend
by
a
valet
de
chambre
and
two
servant
in
livery
,
arrive
at
the
inn
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
perceive
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
and
good
nature
in
his
countenance
;
therefore
,
he
have
no
sooner
alighted
than
I
accost
him
,
and
in
a
few
word
explain
my
situation
:
<EOS>
He
listen
with
great
politeness
,
and
when
I
have
make
an
end
of
my
story
,
say
,
"
well
,
monsieur
,
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
<EOS>
"
I
be
effectually
abash
at
this
interrogation
,
which
I
believe
no
man
of
common
sense
or
generosity
could
make
,
and
make
no
other
reply
than
a
low
bow
:
He
return
the
compliment
still
low
,
and
tript
into
an
apartment
,
while
the
landlord
let
me
know
,
that
my
standing
there
to
interrupt
company
give
offence
,
and
may
do
him
infinite
prejudice
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
occasion
to
repeat
his
insinuation
;
I
move
from
the
place
immediately
;
and
be
so
much
transport
with
grief
,
anger
,
and
disdain
,
that
a
torrent
of
blood
gush
from
my
nostril
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
extasy
,
I
quit
Noyons
,
and
betook
myself
to
the
field
,
where
I
wander
about
like
one
distract
,
till
my
spirit
be
quite
exhausted
,
and
I
be
oblige
to
throw
myself
down
at
the
root
of
a
tree
,
to
rest
my
weary
limb
.
 
<EOS>
here
my
rage
forsook
me
,
I
begin
to
feel
the
importunate
craving
of
nature
,
and
relapse
into
silent
sorrow
and
melancholy
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
I
revolve
all
the
crime
I
have
be
guilty
of
,
and
find
them
so
few
and
venial
,
that
I
could
not
comprehend
the
justice
of
that
providence
,
which
after
have
expose
me
to
so
much
wretchedness
and
danger
,
leave
me
a
prey
to
famine
at
last
in
a
foreign
country
,
where
I
have
not
one
friend
or
acquaintance
to
close
my
eye
,
and
do
the
last
office
of
humanity
to
my
miserable
carcase
.
 
<EOS>
a
thousand
time
I
wish
myself
a
bear
,
that
I
may
retreat
to
wood
and
desart
,
far
from
the
inhospitable
haunt
of
man
,
where
I
could
live
by
my
own
talent
independant
of
treacherous
friend
,
and
supercilious
scorn
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
lie
in
this
manner
,
groan
over
my
hapless
fate
,
I
hear
the
sound
of
a
violin
,
and
raise
my
head
,
perceive
a
company
of
man
and
woman
dance
on
the
grass
at
some
distance
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
upon
this
to
be
a
favourable
season
for
distress
to
attract
compassion
,
when
every
selfish
thought
be
banish
,
and
the
heart
dilate
with
mirth
and
social
joy
;
wherefore
I
get
up
and
approach
those
happy
people
,
whom
I
soon
discover
to
be
a
party
of
soldier
,
with
their
wife
and
child
,
unbend
and
divert
themselves
at
this
rate
,
after
the
fatigue
of
a
march
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
before
see
such
a
parcel
of
scare
-
crow
together
,
neither
could
I
reconcile
their
meagre
gaunt
look
,
their
squalid
and
ragged
attire
,
and
every
other
external
symptom
of
extreme
woe
,
with
this
appearance
of
festivity
.
 
<EOS>
I
salute
them
however
,
and
be
receive
with
great
politesse
;
after
which
they
form
a
ring
and
dance
around
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
jollity
have
a
wonderful
effect
upon
my
spirit
!
<EOS>
I
be
infect
with
their
gayety
,
and
in
spite
of
my
dismal
situation
forget
my
care
,
and
join
in
their
extravagance
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
recreate
ourselves
a
good
while
at
this
diversion
,
the
lady
spread
their
manteaus
on
the
ground
,
upon
which
they
empty
their
knapsack
,
of
some
onion
,
coarse
bread
,
and
and
few
flask
of
poor
wine
:
    
be
invite
to
a
share
of
the
banquet
,
I
sit
down
with
the
rest
,
and
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
never
make
a
more
comfortable
meal
.
 
<EOS>
when
our
repast
be
end
,
we
get
up
again
to
dance
;
and
now
that
I
find
myself
refresh
,
I
behave
to
the
admiration
of
every
body
:
<EOS>
I
be
load
with
a
thousand
compliment
,
and
profession
of
friendship
;
the
man
commend
my
person
and
agility
,
and
the
woman
be
loud
in
the
praise
of
my
bonne
grace
;
 
the
serjeant
in
particular
,
express
so
much
regard
for
me
,
and
describe
the
agreemen
of
a
soldier
's
life
,
with
so
much
art
,
that
I
begin
to
listen
to
his
proposal
of
enlist
me
in
the
service
;
and
the
more
I
consider
my
own
condition
<EOS>
,
the
more
I
be
convince
of
the
necessity
I
be
under
to
come
to
a
speedy
determination
.
 
<EOS>
have
therefore
maturely
weigh
the
circumstance
pro
and
con
,
I
signify
my
consent
,
and
be
admit
into
the
regiment
of
Picardy
,
say
to
be
the
old
corp
in
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
the
company
to
which
this
command
belong
,
be
quarter
at
a
village
not
far
off
,
whither
we
march
next
day
,
and
I
be
present
to
my
captain
,
who
seem
very
well
pleased
with
my
appearance
,
give
me
a
crown
to
drink
,
and
order
me
to
be
accommodate
with
cloath
,
arm
and
accoutrement
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
sell
my
livery
suit
,
purchase
linnen
,
and
as
I
be
at
great
pain
to
learn
the
exercise
,
in
a
very
short
time
become
a
compleat
soldier
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
we
receive
order
to
join
several
more
regiment
,
and
march
with
all
expedition
into
Germany
,
in
order
to
reinforce
Marechal
Duc
de
Noailles
,
who
be
then
encamp
with
his
army
on
the
side
of
the
river
Main
,
to
watch
the
motion
of
the
English
,
Austrians
,
and
hessian
,
under
the
command
of
the
earl
of
Stair
.
    
<EOS>
We
begin
our
march
accordingly
,
and
then
I
become
acquaint
with
that
part
of
a
soldier
's
life
to
which
I
have
be
a
stranger
hitherto
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
describe
the
hunger
and
thirst
I
sustain
,
and
the
fatigue
I
undergo
in
a
march
of
so
many
hundred
mile
;
during
which
,
I
be
so
much
chafed
with
the
heat
and
motion
of
my
limb
,
that
in
a
very
short
time
the
inside
of
my
thigh
and
leg
be
deprive
of
skin
,
and
I
proceed
in
the
utmost
torture
.
 
<EOS>
this
misfortune
I
owe
to
the
plumpness
of
my
constitution
,
which
I
curse
,
and
envy
the
withered
condition
of
my
comrade
,
whose
body
could
not
spare
juice
enough
to
supply
a
common
issue
,
and
be
indeed
proof
against
all
manner
of
friction
.
<EOS>
the
continual
pain
I
feel
make
me
fretful
,
and
my
peevishness
be
increase
by
the
mortification
of
my
pride
in
see
these
miserable
wretch
,
whom
a
hard
gale
of
wind
would
have
scatter
through
the
air
like
chaff
,
bear
those
toil
with
alacrity
,
under
which
I
be
ready
to
sink
.
    
<EOS>
one
day
while
we
enjoy
a
halt
,
and
the
soldier
with
their
wife
have
go
out
to
dance
,
accord
to
custom
,
my
comrade
staid
at
home
with
me
on
pretence
of
friendship
,
and
insult
me
with
his
pity
and
consolation
!
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
though
I
be
young
and
tender
at
present
,
I
would
soon
be
season
to
the
service
;
and
he
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
the
honour
to
contribute
in
some
measure
to
the
glory
of
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
courage
,
therefore
,
my
child
(
say
he
)
and
pray
to
the
good
God
,
that
you
may
be
as
happy
as
I
be
,
who
have
have
the
honour
of
serve
Lewis
the
great
,
and
of
receive
many
wound
in
help
to
establish
his
glory
.
"
     
<EOS>
when
I
look
upon
the
contemptible
object
that
pronounce
these
word
,
I
be
amazed
at
the
infatuation
that
possess
him
;
and
could
not
help
express
my
astonishment
at
the
absurdity
of
a
rational
being
,
who
think
himself
highly
honour
in
be
permit
to
encounter
abject
poverty
,
oppression
,
famine
,
disease
,
mutilation
,
and
evident
death
,
merely
to
gratify
the
vicious
ambition
of
a
prince
,
by
whom
his
suffering
be
disregard
,
and
his
name
utterly
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
,
that
if
his
situation
be
the
consequence
of
compulsion
,
as
have
be
press
into
the
service
,
I
would
praise
his
patience
and
fortitude
in
bear
his
lot
;
 
if
he
have
take
up
arm
in
defence
of
his
injure
country
,
he
be
to
be
applaud
for
his
patriotism
;
 
or
if
he
have
flee
to
this
way
of
life
as
a
refuge
from
a
great
evil
,
he
be
justifiable
in
his
own
conscience
,
(
though
I
could
have
no
notion
of
misery
more
extreme
than
that
he
suffer
;
)
but
to
put
his
condition
on
the
footing
of
conduct
to
the
glory
of
his
prince
,
be
no
more
than
profess
himself
a
desperate
slave
,
who
voluntarily
undergo
the
utmost
wretchedness
and
peril
,
and
commit
the
most
flagrant
crime
,
to
sooth
the
barbarous
pride
of
a
fellow
-
creature
,
his
superior
in
nothing
but
the
power
he
derive
from
the
submission
of
such
wretch
as
he
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
be
very
much
affront
at
the
liberty
I
take
with
his
king
,
which
,
he
say
,
nothing
but
my
ignorance
could
excuse
:
    
<EOS>
He
affirm
,
that
the
character
of
prince
be
sacred
,
and
ought
not
to
be
profane
by
the
censure
of
their
subject
,
who
be
bind
by
their
allegiance
to
obey
their
command
,
of
what
nature
soever
,
without
scruple
or
repine
 
and
advise
me
to
correct
the
rebellious
principle
I
have
imbibe
among
the
English
,
who
,
for
their
insolence
to
their
king
,
be
notorious
all
over
the
world
,
even
to
a
proverb
:
<EOS>
Le
roy'd
Angleterre
,
 
Est
le
roy
de
l'Enfer
.
    
<EOS>
in
vindication
of
my
countryman
,
I
adduce
all
the
argument
commonly
use
to
prove
that
every
man
have
a
natural
right
to
liberty
;
that
allegiance
and
protection
be
reciprocal
;
that
when
the
mutual
tie
be
break
by
the
tyranny
of
the
king
,
he
be
accountable
to
the
people
for
his
breach
of
contract
,
and
subject
to
the
penalty
of
the
law
;
and
that
those
insurrection
of
the
English
,
which
be
brand
with
the
name
of
rebellion
,
by
the
slave
of
arbitrary
power
,
be
no
other
than
glorious
effort
to
rescue
that
independance
which
be
their
birthright
,
from
the
ravenous
claws
of
usurping
ambition
.
 
<EOS>
the
Frenchman
,
provoke
at
the
little
deference
I
pay
to
the
kingly
name
,
lose
all
patience
,
and
reproach
me
in
such
a
manner
,
that
my
temper
forsook
me
,
and
I
clench
my
fist
,
with
an
intention
to
give
him
a
hearty
box
on
the
ear
.
 
<EOS>
perceive
my
design
,
he
start
back
,
and
demand
a
parley
;
upon
which
I
check
my
indignation
,
and
he
give
me
to
understand
that
a
Frenchman
never
forgave
a
blow
;
therefore
if
I
be
not
weary
of
my
life
,
I
would
do
well
to
spare
him
that
mortification
,
and
do
him
the
honour
of
measure
his
sword
with
mine
,
like
a
gentleman
.
     
<EOS>
I
take
his
advice
and
follow
him
to
a
field
hard
by
,
where
indeed
I
be
ashamed
at
the
pitiful
figure
of
my
antagonist
,
who
be
a
poor
,
little
,
shivering
creature
decrepid
with
age
,
and
blind
of
one
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
soon
find
the
folly
of
judge
from
appearance
;
be
at
the
second
pass
wound
in
the
sword
hand
,
and
immediately
disarm
with
such
a
jerk
,
that
I
think
the
joint
be
dislocate
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
less
confounded
than
enraged
at
this
event
,
especially
as
my
adversary
do
not
bear
his
success
with
all
the
moderation
that
may
have
be
expect
;
for
he
insist
upon
my
ask
pardon
for
my
presumption
in
affront
his
king
and
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
would
by
no
means
comply
with
,
but
tell
him
,
it
be
a
mean
condescension
,
which
no
gentleman
in
his
circumstance
ought
to
propose
,
nor
none
in
my
situation
perform
;
 
and
that
if
he
persist
in
his
ungenerous
demand
,
I
would
in
my
turn
claim
satisfaction
with
my
musket
,
at
which
weapon
we
should
be
more
upon
a
par
,
than
with
the
sword
,
of
which
he
seem
so
much
master
.

the

his

with
all
the

<EOS>
in

I

at

put
to
flight
 
the
behaviour
of
the
french
soldier
on
that
occasion
 
<EOS>
I
industriously
seek
another
combat
with
the
old
gascon
,
and
vanquish
him
in
my
turn
 
our
regiment
be
put
into
winter
quarter
at
Rheims
,
where
I
find
my
friend
Strap
 
our
recognition
 
<EOS>
he
supply
me
with
money
,
and
procure
my
discharge
 
<EOS>
we
take
a
trip
to
Paris
;
from
whence
we
set
out
for
London
by
the
way
of
Flanders
,
where
we
safely
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
disconcert
at
this
declaration
,
to
which
he
make
no
reply
,
but
repair
to
the
dancer
,
among
whom
he
recount
his
victory
with
many
exaggeration
and
gasconade
;
while
I
,
take
up
my
sword
,
go
to
my
quarter
and
examine
my
wound
,
which
I
find
be
of
no
consequence
.
     
<EOS>
the
same
day
,
an
irish
drummer
,
have
hear
my
misfortune
,
visit
me
,
and
after
have
condole
me
on
the
chance
of
war
,
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
be
master
of
his
sword
,
and
would
in
a
very
short
time
instruct
me
so
thoroughly
in
that
noble
science
,
that
I
should
be
able
to
chastise
the
old
gascon
for
his
insolent
boasting
at
my
expence
.
 
<EOS>
this
friendly
office
he
proffer
on
pretence
of
the
regard
he
have
for
his
countryman
;
<EOS>
but
I
afterwards
learn
the
true
motive
be
no
other
than
a
jealousy
be
entertain
of
a
correspondence
between
the
Frenchman
and
his
wife
,
which
he
do
not
think
proper
to
resent
in
person
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
I
accept
his
offer
,
and
practise
his
lesson
with
such
application
,
that
I
soon
believe
myself
a
match
for
my
conqueror
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
we
continue
our
march
,
and
arrive
at
the
camp
of
Mareschal
Noailles
,
the
night
before
the
battle
of
Dettingen
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
we
have
undergo
,
our
regiment
be
one
of
those
that
be
order
next
day
to
cross
the
river
,
under
the
command
of
the
Duc
de
Gramont
,
to
take
possession
of
a
narrow
defile
,
through
which
the
ally
must
of
necessity
have
pass
at
a
great
disadvantage
,
or
remain
where
they
be
,
and
perish
for
want
of
provision
,
if
they
would
not
condescend
to
surrender
at
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
how
they
suffer
themselves
to
be
pen
up
in
this
manner
,
it
be
not
my
province
to
relate
;
I
shall
only
observe
,
that
when
we
have
take
possession
of
our
ground
,
I
hear
an
old
officer
in
conversation
with
another
,
profess
a
surprise
at
the
conduct
of
Lord
Stair
,
who
have
the
reputation
of
a
good
general
.
     
<EOS>
but
it
seem
,
at
this
time
,
that
nobleman
be
over
-
rule
,
and
only
act
in
an
inferior
character
;
so
that
no
part
of
the
blame
could
be
impute
to
him
,
who
declare
his
disapprobation
of
the
step
,
in
consequence
of
which
the
whole
army
be
in
the
utmost
danger
;
but
providence
or
destiny
act
miracle
in
their
behalf
,
by
dispose
the
Duc
de
Gramont
to
quit
his
advantageous
post
,
pass
the
defile
,
and
attack
the
English
,
who
be
draw
up
in
order
of
battle
on
the
plain
,
and
who
handle
us
so
roughly
,
that
after
have
lose
a
great
number
of
man
,
we
turn
our
back
without
ceremony
,
and
flee
with
such
precipitation
,
that
many
hundred
perish
in
the
river
,
through
pure
fear
and
confusion
;
for
the
enemy
be
so
generous
,
that
they
do
not
pursue
us
one
inch
of
ground
;
and
if
our
consternation
would
have
permit
,
we
may
have
retreat
with
great
order
and
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
but
not
withstand
the
royal
clemency
of
the
king
of
Great
Britain
,
who
head
the
ally
in
person
,
and
no
doubt
,
put
a
stop
to
the
carnage
,
our
loss
amount
to
5000
man
,
among
whom
be
many
officer
of
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
Our
miscarriage
open
a
passage
for
the
foe
to
Hanau
,
whither
they
immediately
march
,
leave
their
sick
and
wounded
to
the
care
of
the
French
,
who
next
day
take
possession
of
the
field
of
battle
,
bury
the
dead
,
and
treat
the
living
with
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
consolation
to
us
,
who
thence
take
occasion
to
claim
the
victory
;
and
the
genius
of
the
french
nation
never
appear
more
conspicuous
than
now
,
in
the
rhodomontade
they
utter
on
the
subject
of
their
generosity
and
courage
:
<EOS>
every
man
,
(
by
his
own
account
)
perform
seat
that
would
have
shame
all
the
hero
of
antiquity
.
 
<EOS>
one
compare
himself
to
a
lion
retire
at
leisure
from
his
cowardly
pursuer
,
who
keep
at
a
wary
distance
,
and
gall
him
with
their
dart
.
     
<EOS>
another
liken
himself
to
a
bear
that
retreat
with
his
face
to
the
enemy
,
who
dare
not
assail
him
;
and
a
third
assume
the
character
of
a
desperate
stag
,
that
turn
upon
the
hound
and
keep
them
at
bay
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
private
soldier
engage
,
who
have
not
by
the
prowess
of
his
single
arm
,
demolish
a
whole
platoon
,
or
put
a
squadron
of
horse
to
flight
;
and
among
other
,
the
meagte
gascon
extol
his
exploit
above
those
of
Hercules
or
Charlemagne
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
still
retain
my
resentment
for
the
disgrace
I
suffer
in
my
last
recontre
with
him
,
and
now
that
I
think
myself
qualified
,
long
for
an
opportunity
to
retrieve
my
honour
;
I
magnify
the
valour
of
the
English
with
all
the
hyperbole
I
could
imagine
,
and
decry
the
pusilanimity
of
the
French
in
the
same
stile
,
compare
them
to
hare
fly
before
grey
-
hound
,
or
mouse
pursue
by
cat
;
and
pass
an
ironical
compliment
on
the
speed
he
exert
in
his
flight
,
which
,
consider
his
age
and
infirmity
,
I
say
be
surprising
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sting
to
the
quick
by
this
sarcasm
,
and
with
an
air
of
threatne
disdain
,
bid
me
know
myself
better
,
and
remember
the
correction
I
have
already
receive
from
him
for
my
insolence
;
for
he
may
not
be
always
in
the
humour
of
spare
a
wretch
who
abuse
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
to
this
inuendo
I
make
no
reply
but
by
a
kick
on
the
breech
,
which
overturn
him
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
up
with
wonderful
agility
,
and
draw
his
sword
,
attack
me
with
great
fury
:
several
people
interpose
,
but
when
he
inform
them
of
its
be
an
affair
of
honour
,
they
retire
and
leave
us
to
decide
the
battle
by
ourselves
.
    
<EOS>
I
sustain
his
onset
with
little
damage
,
have
only
receive
a
small
scratch
on
my
right
shoulder
,
and
see
his
breath
and
vigour
almost
exhausted
,
assault
him
in
my
turn
,
close
with
him
,
and
wrest
his
sword
out
of
his
hand
in
the
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
have
thus
acquire
the
victory
,
I
desire
him
to
beg
his
life
;
to
which
he
make
no
answer
,
but
shrug
up
his
shoulder
to
his
ear
,
expand
his
hand
,
elevate
the
skin
of
his
forehead
and
eye
-
brow
,
and
depress
the
corner
of
his
mouth
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
I
could
scarce
refrain
from
laugh
aloud
at
his
grotesque
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
may
,
however
,
mortify
his
vanity
,
which
have
triumph
without
bound
over
my
misfortune
,
I
thrust
his
sword
up
to
the
hilt
in
something
(
it
be
not
a
tansy
)
<EOS>
that
lie
smoaking
on
the
plain
,
and
join
the
rest
of
the
soldier
with
an
air
of
tranquility
and
indifference
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
of
moment
attempt
by
either
of
the
army
during
the
remain
part
of
the
campaign
,
which
be
end
,
the
English
march
back
to
the
Netherlands
;
part
of
our
army
be
detach
to
french
flander
,
and
our

order
to
winter

quarter
in
Champagne
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
fate
of
the
grenadier
company
,
to
which
I
now
belong
,
to
lie
at
Rheims
,
where
I
find
myself
in
the
utmost
want
of
every
thing
:
    
<EOS>
My
pay
,
which
amount
to
five
sol
a
day
,
so
far
from
supply
me
with
necessary
,
be
scarce
sufficient
to
procure
a
wretched
subsistance
,
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
;
so
that
I
be
by
hunger
and
hard
duty
,
bring
down
to
the
meagre
condition
of
my
fellow
-
soldier
,
and
<EOS>
my
linen
reduce
from
three
tolerable
shirt
,
to
two
pair
of
sleeve
and
neck
,
the
body
have
be
long
ago
convert
into
spatter
-
dash
;
and
after
all
,
I
be
better
provide
than
any
private
man
in
the
regiment
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
urgency
of
my
affair
,
I
write
to
my
uncle
in
England
,
though
my
hope
from
that
quarter
be
not
at
all
sanguine
,
for
the
reason
I
have
already
explain
,
and
in
the
mean
time
have
recourse
to
my
old
remedy
patience
,
console
myself
with
the
flattering
suggestion
of
a
lively
imagination
that
never
abandon
me
in
my
distress
.
    
<EOS>
one
day
,
while
I
stand
centinel
at
the
gate
of
a
general
officer
,
a
certain
nobleman
come
to
the
door
,
follow
by
a
gentleman
in
mourning
,
to
whom
,
at
parting
,
I
hear
him
say
,
"
You
may
depend
upon
my
good
office
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
assurance
be
answer
by
a
low
bow
of
the
person
in
black
,
who
turn
to
go
away
,
discover
to
me
the
individual
countenance
of
my
old
friend
and
adherent
Strap
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
astonish
at
the
sight
,
that
I
lose
the
power
of
utterance
,
and
before
I
could
recollect
myself
,
he
be
go
,
without
take
any
notice
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
have
he
staid
,
I
scarce
would
have
venture
to
accost
him
;
because
,
though
I
be
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
feature
of
his
face
,
I
could
not
be
positively
certain
as
to
the
rest
of
his
person
,
which
be
very
much
alter
for
the
well
,
since
he
leave
me
at
London
;
neither
could
I
conjecture
by
what
mean
he
be
enable
to
appear
in
the
sphere
of
a
gentleman
,
to
which
,
while
I
know
him
,
he
have
not
even
the
ambition
to
aspire
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
too
much
concerned
in
the
affair
to
neglect
further
information
,
and
therefore
take
the
first
opportunity
of
ask
the
porter
if
he
know
the
gentleman
to
whom
the
Marquis
speak
.
    
<EOS>
the
Swiss
tell
me
,
his
name
be
Monsieur
d'Estrapes
,
that
he
have
be
valet
de
chambre
to
an
english
gentleman
lately
decease
,
and
that
he
be
very
much
regard
by
the
Marquis
for
his
fidelity
to
his
master
,
between
whom
and
that
nobleman
a
very
intimate
friendship
have
subsist
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
me
than
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
which
banish
all
doubt
of
its
be
my
friend
,
who
have
find
mean
to
frenchify
his
name
as
well
as
his
behaviour
,
since
we
part
.
<EOS>
as
soon
therefore
,
as
I
be
relieve
,
I
go
to
his
lodging
,
accord
to
a
direction
give
me
by
the
Swiss
,
and
have
the
good
fortune
to
find
him
at
home
.
<EOS>
that
I
may
surprize
him
the
more
,
I
conceal
my
name
and
business
,
and
only
desire
the
servant
of
the
house
,
to
tell
Monsieur
d'Estrapes
,
that
I
beg
the
honour
of
half
an
hour
's
conversation
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
confound
and
dismay
at
this
message
,
when
he
understand
it
be
send
by
a
soldier
,
though
he
be
conscious
to
himself
of
no
crime
;
all
that
he
have
hear
of
the
Bastile
appear
to
his
imagination
with
aggravated
horror
,
and
it
be
not
before
I
have
wait
a
considerable
time
,
that
he
have
resolution
enough
to
bid
the
servant
shew
me
up
stair
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
enter
his
chamber
,
he
return
my
bow
with
great
civility
,
and
endeavour
with
force
complaisance
,
to
disguise
his
fear
,
which
appear
in
the
paleness
of
his
face
,
the
wildness
of
his
look
,
and
the
shaking
of
his
limb
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
divert
at
his
consternation
,
which
redouble
,
when
I
tell
him
(
in
French
)
<EOS>
I
have
business
for
his
private
ear
,
and
demand
a
particular
audience
.
 
<EOS>
the
valet
be
withdraw
,
I
ask
in
the
same
language
,
if
his
name
be
d'Estrapes
,
to
which
he
answer
,
with
a
foultere
tongue
,
"
the
same
,
at
your
service
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
be
you
a
Frenchman
?
<EOS>
(
say
I.
)
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
honour
to
be
a
Frenchman
bear
(
reply
he
)
<EOS>
but
I
have
an
infinite
veneration
for
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
then
desire
he
would
do
me
the
honour
to
look
at
me
,
which
he
no
sooner
do
,
than
strike
with
my
appearance
,
he
start
back
and
cry
in
English
,
"
o
Jesus
!
 
<EOS>
sure
it
can
not
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
'
tis
impossible
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
smile
at
his
interjection
,
say
,
"
I
suppose
you
be
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
own
your
friend
in
adversity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
he
hear
me
pronounce
these
word
in
our
own
language
,
he
leap
upon
me
in
a
transport
of
joy
,
hang
about
my
neck
,
kiss
me
from
ear
to
ear
,
and
blubber
like
a
great
school
-
boy
who
have
be
whipt
.
 
<EOS>
then
observe
my
dress
,
he
set
up
his
throat
,
cry
,
"
o
l####d
!
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
L####d
!
<EOS>
that
ever
I
should
live
to
see
my
dear
friend
reduce
to
the
condition
of
a
foot
soldier
in
the
french
service
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
consent
to
my
leaving
you
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
the
reason
 
you
think
you
have
get
more
creditable
friend
,
and
grow
ashamed
of
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Lord
help
us
!
<EOS>
though
I
be
a
little
short
-
sighted
,
I
be
not
altogether
blind
;
 
and
though
,
I
do
not
complain
,
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
less
sensible
of
your
unkindness
,
which
be
indeed
the
only
thing
that
induce
me
to
ramble
abroad
,
the
Lord
know
whither
;
but
I
must
own
it
have
be
a
lucky
ramble
to
me
,
and
so
I
forgive
you
,
and
may
God
forgive
you
:
 
o
<EOS>
l####d
!
<EOS>
o
L####d
!
<EOS>
be
it
come
to
this
?
"
     
<EOS>
I
be
nettle
at
the
charge
,
which
,
though
just
,
I
could
not
help
think
unseasonable
,
and
tell
him
with
some
tartness
,
that
whether
his
suspicion
be
well
or
ill
-
ground
,
he
may
have
choose
a
more
convenient
opportunity
of
introduce
them
:
and
that
the
question
now
be
,
whether
or
no
he
find
himself
disposed
to
lend
me
any
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
"
dispose
!
<EOS>
(
reply
he
with
great
emotion
)
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
know
me
so
well
,
as
to
assure
yourself
,
without
ask
,
that
I
,
and
all
that
belong
to
me
,
be
at
your
command
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
you
shall
dine
with
me
,
and
I
will
tell
you
something
that
,
perhaps
,
will
not
be
displease
unto
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
wring
my
hand
,
he
say
,
"
It
make
my
heart
bleed
to
see
you
in
that
garb
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
invitation
,
which
,
I
observe
,
could
not
be
unwelcome
to
a
person
who
have
not
eat
a
comfortable
meal
these
seven
month
;
but
I
have
another
request
to
make
,
which
I
beg
he
would
grant
before
dinner
,
and
that
be
the
loan
of
a
shirt
:
<EOS>
for
although
my
back
have
be
many
week
a
stranger
to
any
comfort
of
this
kind
,
my
skin
be
not
yet
quite
familiarized
to
the
want
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
stare
in
my
face
,
with
a
woful
countenance
,
at
this
declaration
,
which
he
would
scarce
believe
,
until
I
explain
it
,
by
unbutton
my
coat
,
and
disclose
my
naked
body
;
a
circumstance
that
shock
the
tender
-
hearted
Strap
,
who
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
run
to
a
chest
of
drawer
,
and
take
out
some
linen
,
present
to
me
a
very
fine
ruffle
holland
shirt
,
and
cambrick
neckcloth
,
assure
me
<EOS>
,
he
have
three
dozen
of
the
same
kind
at
my
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ravish
at
this
piece
of
good
news
,
and
have
accommodate
myself
in
a
moment
,
hug
my
benefactor
for
his
generous
offer
,
say
,
I
be
overjoyed
to
find
him
undebauched
by
prosperity
,
which
seldom
fail
of
corrupt
the
heart
.
    
<EOS>
He
bespeak
for
dinner
,
some
soup
and
boille
,
a
couple
of
pullet
roast
,
and
a
dish
of
sparrowgrass
,
and
in
the
interim
entertain
me
with
biscuit
and
Burgundy
;
after
which
he
entreat
me
to
gratify
his
longing
desire
of
know
every
circumstance
of
my
fortune
since
his
departure
from
London
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
comply
with
,
begin
at
the
adventure
of
Gawky
,
and
relate
every
particular
event
in
which
I
have
be
concern
from
that
day
to
the
present
hour
.
<EOS>
during
the
recital
,
my
friend
be
strongly
affect
,
accord
to
the
various
situation
describe
:
He
start
with
surprize
,
glow
with
indignation
,
gape
with
curiosity
,
smile
with
pleasure
,
tremble
with
fear
,
and
weep
with
sorrow
,
as
the
vicissitude
of
my
life
inspire
these
different
passion
;
and
when
my
story
be
end
,
signify
his
amazement
on
the
whole
,
by
lift
up
his
eye
and
hand
,
and
protest
,
<EOS>
that
tho
<EOS>
'
I
be
a
young
man
,
I
have
suffer
more
than
all
the
blessed
martyr
.
    
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
I
desire
,
in
my
turn
,
to
know
the
particular
of
his
peregrination
,
and
he
satisfy
me
in
a
few
word
,
by
give
me
to
understand
that
he
have
live
a
year
at
Paris
with
his
master
,
who
,
in
that
time
,
have
acquire
the
language
,
as
well
as
the
fashionable
exercise
,
to
perfection
,
make
a
tour
of
France
and
Holland
,
during
which
excursion
,
he
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
meet
with
three
of
his
own
countryman
on
their
travel
,
in
whose
company
he
commit
such
excess
,
that
his
constitution
fail
,
and
he
fall
into
a
consumption
;
that
by
the
advice
of
physician
he
go
to
Montpelier
for
the
benefit
of
good
air
,
and
recover
so
well
in
six
week
,
that
he
return
to
Rheims
,
seemingly
in
good
health
,
where
he
have
not
continue
above
a
month
,
when
he
be
seize
with
a
looseness
,
that
carry
him
off
in
ten
day
,
to
the
unspeakable
sorrow
of
all
who
know
him
,
and
especially
of
Strap
,
who
have
be
very
happy
in
his
service
,
and
give
such
satisfaction
,
that
his
master
on
his
death
-
bed
,
recommend
him
to
several
person
of
distinction
,
for
his
diligence
,
sobriety
,
and
affection
,
and
leave
him
by
will
,
his
wear
apparel
,
gold
watch
,
sword
,
ring
,
ready
money
,
and
all
the
moveable
he
have
in
France
,
to
the
value
of
three
hundred
pound
,
"
which
I
now
(
say
he
)
in
the
sight
of
God
and
man
,
surrender
to
your
absolute
disposal
:
here
be
my
key
,
take
them
,
I
beseech
you
,
and
God
give
you
joy
of
the
possession
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
brain
be
almost
turn
with
this
sudden
change
of
fortune
,
which
I
could
scarce
believe
real
;
however
,
I
positively
refuse
this
extravagant
proffer
of
my
friend
,
and
put
him
in
mind
of
my
be
a
soldier
;
at
which
he
start
,
cry
,
"
odso
!
<EOS>
that
be
true
 
<EOS>
we
must
procure
your
discharge
 
<EOS>
I
have
some
interest
with
a
nobleman
who
be
able
to
do
me
that
favour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
consult
about
this
affair
,
and
it
be
determine
,
that
Monsieur
d'Estrapes
,
should
wait
upon
the
Marquis
in
the
morning
,
and
tell
him
he
have
by
accident
find
his
brother
,
whom
he
have
not
see
for
many
year
before
,
a
private
soldier
in
the
regiment
of
Picardie
,
and
implore
that
nobleman
's
interest
for
his
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
we
enjoy
ourselves
over
a
bottle
of
good
Burgundy
,
and
spend
the
evening
in
concerting
scheme
for
our
future
conduct
,
in
case
I
should
be
so
lucky
as
to
get
rid
of
the
army
.
     
<EOS>
the
business
be
to
make
ourselves
easy
for
life
,
by
mean
of
his
legacy
,
a
task
very
difficult
,
and
,
in
the
usual
method
of
lay
out
money
,
altogether
impracticable
;
so
that
after
much
canvasing
,
we
could
come
to
no
resolution
that
night
,
but
when
we
part
,
recommend
the
matter
to
the
serious
attention
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
I
puzzle
my
imagination
to
no
purpose
;
when
I
think
of
turn
merchant
,
the
smallness
of
our
stock
,
and
the
risk
of
sea
,
enemy
and
market
,
deter
me
from
that
scheme
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
should
settle
as
a
surgeon
in
my
own
country
,
I
would
find
the
business
already
overstock
;
or
if
I
pretend
to
set
up
in
England
,
must
labour
under
want
of
friend
and
powerful
opposition
,
obstacle
unsurmountable
by
the
most
shining
merit
;
neither
<EOS>
would
I
succeed
in
my
endeavour
to
rise
in
the
state
,
inasmuch
as
I
could
neither
flat
nor
pimp
for
courtier
,
nor
prostitute
my
pen
in
defence
of
a
wicked
and
contemptible
administration
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
could
form
one
feasible
project
,
I
fall
asleep
,
and
my
fancy
be
bless
with
the
image
of
my
dear
Narcissa
,
who
seem
to
smile
upon
my
passion
,
and
offer
her
hand
as
a
reward
for
all
my
toil
.
    
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
,
I
go
to
the
lodging
of
my
friend
,
whom
I
find
exult
over
his
happy
invention
;
for
I
no
sooner
enter
his
apartment
,
than
he
address
me
in
these
word
,
with
a
smile
of
self
-
applause
:
"
well
,
Mr
Random
,
a
lucky
thought
may
come
into
a
fool

head
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hit
it
 
<EOS>
I
will
hold
you
a
button
<EOS>
my
plan
be
well
than
yours

for
all
your
learning

<EOS>
but
you
shall
have
the
preference
in
this
as
in
all

therefore
proceed
,
and
let
us
know
the
effect
of
your
meditation
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
impart
my
own
simple
excogitation
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
that
not
one
thought
occur
to
me
which
deserve
the
least
notice
,
and
signify
my
impatience
to
be
acquaint
with
the
fruit
of
his
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
we
have
not
(
say
he
)
money
sufficient
to
maintain
us
during
a
tedious
expectation
,
it
be
my
opinion
,
that
a
bold
push
must
be
make
;
and
I
see
none
so
likely
to
succeed
as
your
appearing
in
the
character
of
a
gentleman
(
which
be
your
due
)
and
make
your
address
to
some
lady
of
fortune
who
can
render
you
independant
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
do
not
stare
 
I
affirm
that
this
scheme
be
both
prudent
and
honourable
;
<EOS>
for
I
would
not
have
you
throw
yourself
away
upon
an
old
,
toothless
,
wheeze
dame
,
whose
breath
would
stink
you
into
a
consumption
in
less
than
three
month
;
neither
would
I
advise
you
to
assume
the
character
of
a
wealthy
"
Squire
,
as
your
common
fortune
-
hunter
do
,
by
which
mean
many
a
poor
lady
be
cheat
into
matrimony
,
and
instead
of
enjoy
the
pomp
and
grandeur
that
be
promise
,
see
her
dowry
seize
by
her
husband
's
rapacious
creditor
,
and
herself
reduce
to
misery
and
despair
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
know
you
have
a
soul
that
disdain
such
imposition
;
and
be
master
of
qualification
both
of
mind
and
body
,
which
alone
entitle
you
to
a
match
,
that
will
set
you
above
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
cloath
in
my
possession
,
that
a
Duke
nee
not
be
ashamed
to
wear
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
they
will
fit
you
as
they
be
 
if
not
<EOS>
,
there
be
plenty
of
taylor
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
take
a
short
trip
to
Paris
,
and
provide
ourselves
in
all
other
necessary
,
then
set
out
for
England
,
where
I
intend
to
do
myself
the
honour
of
attend
you
in
quality
of
valet
.
     
<EOS>
this
will
save
you
the
expence
of
a
servant
,
shaving
and
dressing
;
and
I
doubt
not
but
by
the
blessing
of
God
,
we
shall
bring
matter
to
a
speedy
and
fortunate
issue
.
"
 
<EOS>
Extravagant
<EOS>
as
this
proposal
be
,
I
listen
to
it
with
pleasure
,
because
it
flatter
my
vanity
,
and
indulge
a
ridiculous
hope
I
begin
to
entertain
of
inspire
Narcissa
with
a
mutual
flame
.
    
<EOS>
after
breakfast

Monsieur
d'Estrapes
go

pay
his
devoir

successful
in
his
application

I
obtain
a
discharge
in
a
few
day

upon
which
we
set
out
for
Paris

<EOS>
here
I
have
time
to
reflect
and
congratulate
myself
upon
this
sudden
transition
of
fate
,
which
to
bear
with
moderation
,
require
some
degree
of
philosophy
and
self

denial
.
 
<EOS>
this
will
be
more
obvious
,
if
I
give
a
detail
of
the
particular

the
quiet

CHAPTER
XLV
<EOS>
I
enquire
about
my
uncle
,
and
understand
he
be
go
to
sea
 
<EOS>
take
lodging
at
char
-
cross
 
<EOS>
go
to
the
play
,
where
I
meet
with
an
adventure
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
an
ordinary
;
the
guest
describe
 
become
acquaint
with
Medlar
and
doctor
Wagtail
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
alight
at
the
Inn
,
I
dispatch
Strap
to
enquire
about
my
uncle
,
at
the
Samson
and
Lion
in
Wapping
;
and
he
return
in
a
little
time
,
with
an
account
of
Mr
Bowling
's
have
go
to
sea
,
mate
of
a
merchant
ship
,
after
a
long
and
unsuccessful
application
and
attendance
at
the
admiralty
;
where
,
it
seem
,
the
interest
he
depend
upon
,
be
not
sufficient
to
reinstate
him
,
or
recover
the
pay
that
be
due
to
him
when
he
quit
the
Thunder
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
I
hire
very
handsome
lodging
not
far
from
char
-
cross
;
and
in
the
evening
,
dress
myself
in
a
plain
suit
of
the
true
Paris
cut
,
and
appear
in
a
front
box
at
the
play
,
where
I
see
a
good
deal
of
company
,
and
have
vanity
enough
to
make
me
believe
,
that
I
be
observe
with
an
uncommon
degree
of
attention
and
applause
.
    
<EOS>
this
silly
conceit
intoxicate
me
so
much
,
that
I
be
guilty
of
a
thousand
ridiculous
coquetry
;
and
I
dare
say
,
how
favourable
soever
<EOS>
the
thought
of
the
company
may
be
at
my
first
appearance
,
they
be
soon
change
by
my
absurd
behaviour
,
into
pity
or
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
up
and
sit
down
,
cover
and
uncover
my
head
twenty
time
between
the
act
;
pull
out
my
watch
,
clap
it
to
my
ear
,
wound
it
up
,
set
it
,
give
it
the
hearing
again
;
 
display
my
snuff
-
box
,
affect
to
take
snuff
,
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
of
shew
my
brilliant
,
and
wipe
my
nose
with
a
perfumed
handkerchief
;
 
then
dangle
my
cane
,
and
adjust
my
sword
-
knot
,
and
act
many
more
foolery
of
the
same
kind
,
in
hope
of
obtain
the
character
of
a
pretty
fellow
,
in
the
acquiring
of
which
,
I
find
two
considerable
obstruction
in
my
disposition
;
namely
,
a
natural
reserve
,
and
jealous
sensibility
.
 
<EOS>
Fain
<EOS>
would
I
have
enter
into
conversation
with
the
people
around
me
;
but
be
restrain
by
the
fear
of
be
censure
for
my
assurance
,
as
well
as
by
reflect
that
I
be
more
entitled
to
a
compliment
of
this
kind
from
them
than
they
to
such
condescension
from
a
stranger
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
how
often
do
I
redden
at
the
frequent
whisper
and
loud
laughter
of
my
fellow
beau
,
which
I
imagine
be
excite
by
me
!
<EOS>
and
how
often
do
I
envy
the
happy
indifference
of
those
choice
spirit
who
beheld
the
distress
of
the
scene
,
without
discover
the
least
symptom
of
approbation
or
concern
!
<EOS>
My
attention
be
engage
in
spite
of
myself
,
and
I
could
not
help
weep
with
the
heroine
of
the
stage
;
though
I
practise
a
great
many
shift
to
conceal
this
impolite
piece
of
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
play
be
end
,
I
sit
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
hand
some
lady
to
her
coach
;
but
every
one
be
attend
by
such
a
number
of
officious
gallant
,
that
for
a
long
time
I
be
baulk
in
my
expectation
.
     
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
I
perceive
a
very
handsome
creature
,
genteelly
dress
,
sit
by
herself
in
a
box
,
at
some
distance
from
me
;
upon
which
I
go
up
to
her
,
and
offer
my
service
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
to
be
in
some
confusion
,
thank
me
for
my
complaisance
,
and
with
a
tender
look
decline
give
me
the
trouble
;
look
at
her
watch
,
and
testify
her
surprize
at
the
negligence
of
her
footman
,
whom
she
have
order
to
have
a
chair
ready
for
her
at
that
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
my
intreaty
with
all
the
eloquence
and
compliment
<EOS>
I
be
master
of
;
and
in
the
event
,
she
be
prevail
upon
to
accept
of
a
proposal
I
make
,
to
send
my
servant
for
a
chair
or
coach
:
<EOS>
accordingly
,
Strap
be
detach
for
that
purpose
,
and
return
without
success
,
there
be
none
to
be
find
;
by
this
time
the
play
-
house
be
quite
empty
,
and
we
be
oblige
to
retire
<EOS>
:
as
I
lead
her
through
the
passage
,
I
observe
five
or
six
young
fellow
of
fashion
,
stand
in
a
corner
,
one
of
whom
,
as
I
think
,
tipt
my
charmer
<EOS>
the
wink
,
and
<EOS>
when
we
be
past
,
I
hear
them
set
up
the
loud
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
this
arrouse
my
attention
,
and
I
be
resolve
to
be
fully
satisfied
of
this
lady
's
character
,
before
I
should
have
any
near
connexion
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
no
convenience
appear
,
I
propose
,
that
I
should
conduct
her
to
a
tavern
,
where
we
may
stay
a
few
minute
,
until
my
servant
could
fetch
a
coach
from
the
Strand
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
particularly
shy
of
trust
herself
in
a
tavern
with
a
stranger
;
but
at
last
,
yield
to
my
pathetic
remonstrance
,
rather
than
endanger
her
health
,
by
remain
in
a
cold
damp
thorough
-
fare
.
     
<EOS>
have
thus
far
succeed
,
I
beg
to
know
what
wine
she
would
be
pleased
to
drink
a
glass
of
;
but
she
profess
the
great
aversion
to
all
sort
of
strong
liquor
;
and
it
be
with
much
difficulty
that
I
could
persuade
her
to
eat
a
jelly
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
endeavour
to
alleviate
the
uneasiness
she
discover
,
by
say
all
the
agreeable
thing
I
could
think
of
;
at
which
she
would
often
sigh
,
and
regard
me
with
a
languishing
look
,
that
seem
too
near
a
-
kin
to
the
lewd
leer
of
a
courtezan
.
 
<EOS>
this
discovery
add
to
my
former
suspicion
,
while
it
put
me
upon
my
guard
against
her
art
,
divest
me
of
reserve
,
and
enable
me
to
entertain
her
with
more
gaity
and
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
I
press
her
to
allow
me
the
honour
of
wait
upon
her
next
day
,
at
her
lodging
,
which
she
,
with
many
apology
,
refuse
,
lest
it
should
give
umbrage
to
Sir
John
,
who
be
of
a
disposition
apt
to
be
fret
with
trifle
.
 
<EOS>
this
information
,
by
which
I
be
to
understand
that
her
husband
be
a
knight
,
do
not
check
my
address
,
which
become
more
and
more
importunate
,
and
I
be
even
hardy
enough
to
ravish
a
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
o
heavens
!
<EOS>
instead
of
banquet
on
the
ambrosial
flavour
,
that
her
delicacy
and
complexion
promise
,
I
be
almost
suffocate
with
the
steam
of
Geneva
!
<EOS>
an
exhalation
of
this
kind
from
a
mouth
which
have
just
before
declare
an
utter
abhorrence
of
all
spirituous
liquor
,
not
only
change
my
doubt
into
certainty
,
but
my
rapture
into
loathing
;
and
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
me
to
have
preserve
common
complaisance
five
minute
longer
,
when
my
servant
return
with
a
coach
.
     
<EOS>
I
take
the
advantage
of
this
occasion
,
and
present
my
hand
to
the
lady
,
who
put
in
practice
against
me
the
whole
artillery
of
her
charm
,
ogle
,
languishing
,
sigh
,
and
squeeze
,
with
so
little
reserve
,
that
Strap
perceive
her
tenderness
,
and
rub
his
hand
with
joy
as
he
follow
us
to
the
door
;
 
but
<EOS>
I
be
proof
against
all
her
endearment
,
and
hand
her
into
the
coach
with
an
intention
to
take
my
leave
immediately
.
<EOS>
She
guess
my
design
,
and
invite
me
to
her
house
,
whisper
,
that
now
Sir
John
be
go
to
bed
,
she
could
have
the
pleasure
of
my
conversation
for
half
an
hour
without
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
there
be
no
mortification
I
would
not
undergo
,
rather
than
endanger
the
repose
of
her
ladyship
;
and
bid
the
coachman
drive
on
,
wish
her
a
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
lose
all
temper
at
my
indifference
,
and
stop
the
coach
at
the
distance
of
about
twenty
yard
from
me
,
pop
out
her
head
,
and
bawl
with
the
lung
of
a
fish
-
woman
,
"
D####n
<EOS>
you
,
you
dog
,
will
not
you
pay
the
coach
-
hire
?
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
answer
:
upon
which
she
hold
forth
against
me
with
an
eloquence
peculiar
to
herself

call
me
pitiful
fellow
,
scoundrel
,
and
an
hundred
such
appellation
;
and
conclude
with
an
oath
,
that
for
all
my
appearance
,
she
believe
I
have
get
no
money
in
my
pocket
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
vent
her
indignation
,
she
order
the
coachman
to
proceed
,
and
I
return
to
the
tavern
,
where
I
bespoke
something
for
supper
,
very
well
pleased
at
the
issue
of
this
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
I
dispense
with
the
attendance
of
the
waiter
at
table
,
on
pretence
that
my
own
servant
be
present
,
and
when
we
be
alone
,
say
to
strap
;
"
well
,
Monsieur
d'Estrapes
,
what
d'ye
think
of
this
lady
?
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
who
have
not
open
his
mouth
since
her
departure
,
could
make
no
other
reply
than
the
monosyllable
"
think
!
"
<EOS>
which
he
pronounce
with
a
note
of
fear
and
astonishment
.
     
<EOS>
surprize
at
this
emphasis
,
I
survey
my
valet
,
and
perceive
a
wildness
in
his
look
,
ask
if
he
have
see
his
grandfather
's
ghost
?
 
<EOS>
"
ghost
!
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
see
a
devil
incarnate
!
<EOS>
who
would
have
think
that
so
much
devilish
malice
and
Billingsgate
,
could
lurk
under
such
sweetness
of
countenance
and
modesty
of
behaviour
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
God
help
us
!
    
<EOS>
Fronti

<EOS>
but
we
ought
to
down
on
our
knee
and
bless
God
for
deliver
us
from
the
jaw
of
that
paint
sepulchre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
pretty
much
of
Strap
's
opinion
,
and
though
I
do
not
believe
myself
in
any
danger
from
the
allurement
of
that
sisterhood
,
I
determine
to
act
with
great
circumspection
for
the
future
,
and
shun
all
commerce
of
that
kind
,
as
equally
prejudicial
to
my
purse
and
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
My
next
care
be
to
introduce
myself
into
a
set
of
good
acquaintance
;
for
which
purpose
,
I
frequent
a
certain
coffee
-
house
,
note
for
the
resort
of
good
company
,
English
as
well
as
foreigner
,
where
my
appearance
procure
all
the
civility
and
advance
I
could
desire
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
ordinary
in
the
same
house
,
I
go
up
stair
to
dinner
with
the
other
guest
,
and
find
myself
at
table
with
thirteen
people
,
the
great
part
of
whom
be
better
dressed
than
myself
.
 
<EOS>
the
conversation
,
which
be
mostly
carry
on
in
French
,
turn
chiefly
on
politick
;
and
I
soon
find
the
whole
company
be
in
the
french
interest
,
myself
except
,
and
a
testy
old
gentleman
,
who
contradict
every
thing
that
be
advance
in
favour
of
his
Most
Christian
Majesty
,
with
a
surliness
truly
English
.
     
<EOS>
but
this
trusty
patriot
,
who
have
never
be
out
of
his
own
country
,
and
draw
all
his
maxim
and
notion
from
prejudice
and
hearsay
,
be
very
unequal
to
his
antagonist
,
who
be
superior
to
him
in
learning
and
experience
,
and
often
take
the
liberty
of
traveller
,
in
assert
thing
which
be
not
strictly
true
,
because
they
think
themselves
in
no
danger
of
be
detect
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
claim
of
the
queen
of
Spain
to
the
austrian
dominion
in
Italy
,
be
fully
explain
and
vindicate
,
by
a
person
who
sit
opposite
to
me
,
and
by
the
solemnity
of
his
manner
,
and
the
richness
of
his
apparel
,
seem
to
be
a
foreign
ambassador
.
 
<EOS>
this
dissertation
introduce
another
on
the
Pragmatic
Sanction
,
handle
with
great
warmth
by
a
young
gentleman
at
my
right
hand
,
dress
in
a
green
frock
trim
with
gold
,
who
justify
the
french
king
for
his
breach
of
that
contract
;
and
affirm
that
he
could
not
have
observe
it
,
without
injure
his
own
glory
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
be
not
at
all
convince
by
this
gentleman
's
argument
,
I
could
not
help
admire
his
vivacity
,
which
I
imagine
must
be
the
effect
of
his
illustrious
birth
,
and
noble
education
,
and
accordingly
rate
him
in
my
conjecture
as
a
young
prince
on
his
travel
.
 
<EOS>
the
discourse
be
afterwards
shift
by
an
old
gentleman
of
a
very
martial
appearance
,
to
the
last
campaign
,
when
the
battle
of
Dettingen
be
fight
over
again
,
with
so
many
circumstance
to
the
honour
of
the
French
,
and
disadvantage
of
the
Allies
,
that
I
begin
to
entertain
some
doubt
of
my
have
be
there
in
person
;
and
take
the
liberty
to
mention
some
objection
to
what
he
advance
.
     
<EOS>
this
introduce
a
dispute
which
last
a
good
while
,
to
the
mortification
of
all
present
;
and
be
at
last
refer
to
the
determination
of
a
grave
person
,
whom
they
stile
doctor
,
and
who
under
a
shew
of
great
moderation
,
decide
it
against
me
,
with
so
little
regard
to
truth
,
that
I
tax
him
with
partiality
in
pretty
severe
term
,
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
the
true
english
politician
,
who
rejoice
at
my
defence
of
a
cause
he
have
so
often
espouse
without
success
:
<EOS>
My
oponent
please
with
the
victory
he
have
gain
,
affect
a
great
deal
of
candour
,
and
tell
me
,
he
would
not
have
be
so
positive
,
if
he
have
not
be
at
great
pain
to
inform
himself
of
each
particular
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
be
convince
,
that
,
the
previous
step
consider
,
thing
could
not
happen
otherwise
;
for
we
general
who
have
see
service
,
tho
'
we
may
not
be
on
the
spot
ourselves
,
know
by
the
least
sketch
of
the
disposition
,
what
must
be
the
event
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
censure
,
with
great
freedom
,
every
circumstance
of
the
conduct
of
those
who
command
the
Allies
;
from
thence
make
a
transition
to
the
Ministry
,
which
he
honour
with
many
invective
,
for
employ
people
who
have
neither
experience
nor
capacity
,
to
the
prejudice
of
old
officer
who
have
be
distinguish
for
both
;
dropt
many
hint
of
his
own
importance
;
and
conclude
with
observing
,
that
the
French
and
Spaniards
know
better
how
to
value
general
of
merit
;
the
good
effect
of
which
be
see
in
the
conquest
they
gain
,
and
the
admirable
discipline
of
their
troop
,
which
be
at
the
same
time
better
cloathe
and
pay
than
any
soldier
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
these
remark
furnish
the
green
knight
with
an
opportunity
of
launch
out
in
the
praise
of
french
government
in
general
,
civil
as
well
as
military
;
on
which
occasion
he
make
many
odious
comparison
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
English
:
    
<EOS>
every
body
,
almost
,
assent
to
the
observation
he
make
,
and
the
doctor
give
his
sanction
,
by
say
,
the
people
in
France
be
undoubtedly
the
happy
subject
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
astonished
and
confound
at
their
infatuation
and
effrontery
,
that
I
have
not
power
to
utter
one
word
in
opposition
to
their
assertion
;
but
my
morose
associate
could
not
put
up
with
the
indignity
that
be
offer
to
old
England
,
and
therefore
with
a
satirical
grin
address
himself
to
the
general
in
these
word
:
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
Sir
,
I
have
often
hear
it
say
,
 
She
be
a
villainous
bird
that
befoul
her
own
nest
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
what
those
people
who
be
foreigner
say
,
I
do
not
mind
it
,
they
know
no
better
;
but
you
who
be
breed
and
bear
,
and
have
get
your
bread
under
the
english
government
,
should
have
more
regard
to
gratitude
as
well
as
truth
,
in
censure
your
native
country
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
ministry
have
think
fit
to
lay
you
aside
,
I
suppose
they
have
their
own
reason
for
so
do
;
and
you
ought
to
remember
that
you
still
live
on
the
bounty
of
this
nation
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
these
gentleman
,
(
mean
the
prince
and
ambassador
)
who
make
so
free
with
our
constitution
,
law
and
genius
of
our
people
,
I
think
they
may
shew
a
little
more
respect
for
their
benefactor
,
who
,
I
must
own
,
be
to
blame
in
harbouring
,
protect
and
encourage
such
ungrateful
vagrant
as
they
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
these
word
the
chevalier
in
green
start
up
in
a
great
passion
,
and
lay
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
hanger
,
exclaim
,
"
ha
!
foutre
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
Englishman
on
the
other
hand
,
grasp
his
cane
,
cry
,
"
do
not
foutre
me
,
sirrah
,
or
by
G####d
,
I
will
knock
you
down
.
"
     
<EOS>
the
company
interpose
,
the
Frenchman
sit
down
again
,
and
his
antagonist
proceed
 
"
Lookee
,
monsieur
,
you
know
very
well
,
that
have
you
dare
to
speak
so
freely
of
the
administration
of
your
own
country
in
Paris
,
as
you
have
do
of
our
in
London
,
you
would
have
be
send
to
the
Bastile
without
ceremony
,
where
you
may
have
rot
in
a
dungeon
,
and
never
see
the
light
of
the
sun
again
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
,
take
my
word
for
it
,
although
our
constitution
screen
us
from
such
oppression
,
we
want
not
law
to
chastise
the
author
of
seditious
discourse
;
and
if
I
hear
another
syllable
out
of
your
mouth
,
in
contempt
or
prejudice
of
this
kingdom
,
I
will
give
you
a
convincing
proof
of
what
I
advance
,
and
have
you
lay
by
the
heel
for
your
presumption
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
declaration
have
an
effect
on
the
company
,
as
sudden
as
surprizing
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
prince
become
supple
as
a
spaniel
,
the
ambassador
tremble
,
the
general
sit
silent
and
abash
,
and
the
doctor
,
who
,
it
seem
,
have
feel
the
rod
of
power
,
grow
pale
as
death
,
and
assure
us
all
,
that
he
have
no
intention
to
affront
any
person
or
people
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
principle
,
doctor
,
(
resume
the
old
gentleman
)
be
no
secret
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
say
upon
that
head
;
but
be
very
much
surprize
,
that
a
man
who
despise
us
so
much
,
should
notwithstanding
live
among
us
,
when
he
have
no
visible
motive
for
so
do
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
take
up
your
habitation
in
your
beloved
France
,
where
you
may
rail
at
England
without
censure
?
"
 
<EOS>
to
this
the
doctor
think
proper
to
make
no
reply
;
and
an
unsocial
silence
ensue
;
which
I
perceive
,
take
notice
,
that
it
be
pity
such
idle
dispute
,
maintain
very
often
for
whim
or
diversion
,
should
create
any
misunderstanding
among
gentleman
of
good
sense
;
and
propose
to
drink
down
all
animosity
in
another
bottle
.
     
<EOS>
this
motion
be
applaud
by
the
whole
company
:
the
wine
be
bring
,
and
the
english
champion
declare
he
have
no
spleen
against
any
man
for
differ
in
opinion
from
him
,
any
more
than
for
difference
of
complexion
,
drink
to
the
good
health
of
all
present
;
the
compliment
be
return
,
and
the
conversation
once
more
become
unreserved
,
though
more
general
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
topick
,
the
subject
of
war
be
introduce
,
on
which
the
general
declaim
with
great
eloquence
,
recount
many
of
his
own
exploit
by
way
of
illustration
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
his
harrangue
he
happen
to
mention
the
word
epaulement
,
upon
which
the
testy
gentleman
ask
the
meaning
of
that
term
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
an
epaulement
be
,
(
reply
he
)
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
an
epaulement
but
once
 
and
that
be
at
the
siege
of
Namur
 
in
a
council
of
war
,
monsieur
Cohorn
,
the
famous
engineer
,
affirm
that
the
place
could
not
be
take
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
(
say
the
prince
of
Vaudemont
)
<EOS>
it
may
be
take
by
an
epaulement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
immediately
put
in
execution
,
and
in
twenty
-
fourhours
Mareschal
Boufflers
be
fain
to
capitulate
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
he
make
a
full
stop
,
and
the
old
gentleman
repeat
the
question
,
"
but
pray
what
be
an
epaulement
?
"
 
<EOS>
to
this
the
officer
make
no
immediate
reply
,
but
ring
the
bell
and
call
for
a
bill
,
which
be
bring
,
he
throw
down
his
proportion
of
the
reckoning
,
and
tell
the
company
,
he
would
shew
them
what
an
epaulement
be
,
when
his
Majesty
think
fit
to
entrust
him
with
the
command
of
our
army
abroad
,
strut
away
with
great
dignity
.
     
<EOS>
I
could
not
imagine
why
he
be
so
shy
of
explain
one
of
the
most
simple
term
of
fortification
;
<EOS>
which
I
forthwith
describe
as
a
side
-
work
compose
of
earth
,
gabion
,
or
faschin
;
but
I
be
very
much
surprize
when
I
afterwards
understand
that
his
reserve
proceed
from
his
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
have
pay
our
bill
,
we
adjourn
to
the
coffee
-
room
,
where
my
fellow
-
labourer
insist
on
treat
me
with
a
dish
,
give
me
to
understand
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
have
acquire
his
good
opinion
,
both
with
respect
to
my
principle
and
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
compliment
,
and
profess
myself
an
utter
stranger
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
beg
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
inform
me
of
the
quality
and
character
of
the
people
who
dine
above
.
 
<EOS>
this
request
be
a
real
favour
to
one
of
his
disposition
,
which
be
no
less
communicative
than
curious
;
he
therefore
comply
with
great
satisfaction
,
and
let
me
know
,
to
my
extreme
astonishment
,
that
the
suppose
young
prince
be
a
dancer
at
one
of
the
theatre
;
and
the
ambassador
no
other
than
a
fidler
belong
to
the
opera
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
(
say
he
)
be
a
Roman
Catholick
priest
,
who
sometimes
appear
in
the
character
of
an
officer
,
and
assume
the
name
of
captain
;
but
more
generally
take
the
garb
,
title
and
behaviour
of
a
physician
,
in
which
capacity
he
wheedle
himself
into
the
confidence
of
weak
-
minded
people
,
and
by
argument
no
less
specious
than
false
,
convert
them
from
their
religion
and
allegiance
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
the
hand
of
justice
more
than
once
for
such
practice
;
but
he
be
a
fly
dog
,
and
manage
matter
with
so
much
craft
,
that
hitherto
he
have
escape
for
a
short
imprisonment
.
     
<EOS>
as
for
the
general
,
you
may
see
he
have
owe
his
promotion
more
to
his
interest
than
his
capacity
;
and
now
that
the
eye
of
the
ministry
be
open
,
his
friend
dead
,
or
become
inconsiderable
,
he
be
strike
off
the
lift
,
and
oblige
to
put
up
with
a
yearly
pension
;
in
consequence
of
this
reduction
,
he
be
become
malecontent
,
and
enveigh
against
the
government
in
all
company
,
with
so
little
discretion
,
that
I
be
surprised
at
the
lenity
of
the
administration
in
overlook
his
insolence
,
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
,
he
owe
his
safety
to
his
weakness
and
want
of
importance
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
see
a
little
,
and
but
a
little
service
,
and
yet
if
you
will
take
his
word
for
it
<EOS>
,
there
have
not
be
a
great
action
perform
in
the
field
since
the
revolution
,
in
which
he
be
not
principally
concern
.
<EOS>
when
a
story
be
tell
of
any
great
general
,
he
immediately
match
it
with
one
of
himself
,
though
he
be
often
unhappy
in
his
invention
,
and
commit
such
gross
blunder
in
the
detail
,
that
every
body
be
in
pain
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Caesar
,
Pompey
,
and
Alexander
the
Great
be
continually
in
his
mouth
;
and
as
he
read
a
good
deal
without
any
judgment
to
digest
it
,
his
idea
be
confused
,
and
his
harrangue
as
unintelligible
as
infinite
;
for
,
once
he
begin
,
there
be
no
chance
of
his
leave
off
speak
,
while
one
person
remain
to
yield
attention
;
therefore
the
only
expedient
I
know
,
of
put
a
stop
to
his
loquacity
,
be
to
lay
hold
of
some
incongruity
he
have
utter
,
and
demand
an
explanation
;
or
ask
the
meaning
of
some
difficult
term
that
he
know
by
name
only
,
this
will
effectually
put
him
to
silence
,
if
not
to
flight
,
as
it
happen
when
I
enquire
about
an
epaulement
.
     
<EOS>
have
he
be
acquaint
with
the
signification
of
that
word
,
his
triumph
would
have
be
intolerable
,
and
we
must
have
quit
the
field
first
,
or
be
worry
with
impertinence
.
"
 
<EOS>
have
thus
gratify
my
curiosity
,
the
old
gentleman
begin
to
discover
his
own
,
in
question
relate
to
myself
,
to
which
I
think
proper
to
return
ambiguous
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
presume
,
Sir
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
have
travel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
I
dare
say
,
you
would
find
it
very
expensive
(
say
he
.
)
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
,
"
to
be
sure
,
one
can
not
travel
without
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
know
by
experience
(
say
he
)
for
I
myself
take
a
trip
to
Bath
or
Tunbridge
every
season
;
and
one
must
pay
sauce
for
what
he
have
on
the
road
as
well
in
other
country
as
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
very
pretty
stone
in
your
ring
,
 
give
me
leave
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
 
the
French
have
attain
to
a
wonderful
skill
in
make
composition
of
this
kind
.
 
<EOS>
why
now
,
this
look
almost
as
well
as
a
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
almost
as
well
,
Sir
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
why
not
altogether
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
<EOS>
if
you
understand
any
thing
of
jewel
,
you
must
perceive
at
first
sight
,
that
this
stone
be
a
real
diamond
,
and
that
of
a
very
fine
water
.
 
<EOS>
take
it
in
your
hand
,
and
examine
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
,
with
some
confusion
,
and
return
it
,
say
,
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
I
see
it
be
a
true
brilliant
of
immense
value
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
imagine
his
respect
for
me
increase
after
this
inquiry
;
therefore
to
captivate
his
esteem
the
more
,
I
tell
him
,
I
would
shew
him
a
seal
of
composition
,
engrave
after
a
very
valuable
antique
;
upon
which
I
pull
out
my
watch
with
a
rich
gold
chain
,
adorn
with
three
seal
set
in
gold
,
and
an
opal
ring
.
 
<EOS>
He
view
each
of
them
with
great
eagerness
,
handle
the
chain
,
admire
the
chafed
case
,
and
observe
that
the
whole
must
have
cost
me
a
vast
sum
of
money
.
    
<EOS>
I
affect
indifference
,
and
reply
in
a
careless
manner
,
"
some
trifle
of
sixty
or
seventy
guinea
.
<EOS>
"
upon
which
he
stare
in
my
face
for
some
time
,
and
then
ask
if
I
be
an
Englishman
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
from
Ireland
then
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
I
presume
,
(
say
he
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
make
the
same
reply
.
"
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
perhaps
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
be
bear
in
one
of
our
settlement
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
still
answer
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
very
much
surprize
,
and
say
,
he
be
sure
I
be
not
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
reply
,
but
leave
him
upon
the
tenter
-
hook
of
impatient
uncertainty
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
contain
his
anxiety
,
but
ask
pardon
for
the
liberty
he
have
take
,
and
to
encourage
me
the
more
to
disclose
my
situation
,
display'd
his
own
without
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
(
say
he
)
a
single
man
,
have
a
considerable
annuity
,
on
which
I
live
accord
to
my
own
inclination
;
and
make
the
end
of
the
year
meet
very
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
no
estate
to
leave
behind
me
,
I
be
not
trouble
with
the
importunate
officiousness
of
relation
,
or
legacy
hunter
,
and
I
consider
the
world
as
make
for
me
,
not
me
for
the
world
:
<EOS>
It
be
my
maxim
therefore
to
enjoy
it
while
I
can
,
and
let
futurity
shift
for
itself
.
"
 
<EOS>
while
he
thus
indulge
his
own
talkative
vein
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
no
doubt
,
expect
a
retaliation
from
me
;
a
young
man
enter
,
dress
in
black
velvet
and
an
enormous
tye
-
wig
,
with
an
air
in
which
natural
levity
and
affect
solemnity
be
so
jumbled
together
,
that
on
the
whole
,
he
appear
a
burlesque
on
all
decorum
.
<EOS>
this
ridiculous
oddity
dance
up
to
the
table
at
which
we
sit
,
and
after
a
thousand
grimace
,
ask
my
friend
by
the
name
of
Mr
Medlar
,
if
we
be
not
engage
upon
business
.
     
<EOS>
My
companion
put
on
a
surly
countenance
,
and
reply
,
"
no
great
business
,
doctor
 
but
however
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
then
(
cry
the
physician
)
<EOS>
I
must
beg
your
indulgence
a
little
,
pray
pardon
me
,
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
(
say
he
,
address
himself
to
me
)
<EOS>
your
most
humble
servant
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
,
<EOS>
Sir
 
I
must
beg
the
favour
to
sit
 
<EOS>
Sir
 
<EOS>
Sir
 
<EOS>
I
have
something
of
consequence
to
impart
to
my
friend
Mr
Medlar
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
freedom
in
whispering
,
Sir

"
 
<EOS>
before
I
have
time
to
give
this
complaisant
person
my
permission
,
Mr
Medlar
cry
,
"
I
will
have
no
whispering
 
if
you
have
any
thing
to
say
to
me
,
speak
with
an
audible
voice
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
seem
a
little
disconcert
at
this
exclamation
,
and
turn
again
to
me
,
make
a
thousand
apology
for
pretend
to
make
a
mystery
of
any
thing
,
which
he
say
be
owe
to
his
ignorance
of
my
connexion
with
Mr
Medlar
;
but
now
he
understand
I
be
a
friend
,
he
would
communicate
what
he
have
to
say
,
in
my
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
begin
,
after
two
or
three
hem
,
in
this
manner
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
be
just
come
from
dinner
at
my
lady
Flareit
's
,
(
then
address
himself
to
me
)
a
lady
of
quality
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
at
whose
table
I
have
the
honour
of
dining
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
lady
Stately
,
and
my
lady
Larum
,
and
Mrs
Dainty
,
and
Miss
Biddy
Gigler
,
upon
my
word
,
a
very
good
nature
young
lady
,
with
a
very
pretty
fortune
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
also
my
Lord
Straddle
,
Sir
John
Shrug
,
and
master
Billy
Chatter
,
who
be
actually
a
very
facetious
young
gentleman
.
     
<EOS>
so
,
Sir
,
her
ladyship
see
me
excessively
fatigue
,
for
she
be
the
last
of
fifteen
patient
(
people
of
distinction
,
Sir
)
whom
I
have
visit
this
forenoon
,
 
insist
upon
my
staying
dinner
,
 
<EOS>
though
upon
my
word
,
I
protest
I
have
no
appetite
:
however
,
in
compliance
with
her
ladyship
's
request
,
Sir
,
I
sit
down
,
and
the
conversation
turn
on
different
subject
,
among
other
thing
<EOS>
,
Mr
Chatter
ask
very
earnestly
when
I
see
Mr
Medlar
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
have
not
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
these
nineteen
hour
and
a
half
;
for
you
may
remember
,
Sir
,
it
be
nearly
about
that
time
;
I
will
not
be
positive
as
to
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
!
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
then
I
desire
you
will
go
to
his
lodging
immediately
after
dinner
,
and
see
what
be
the
matter
with
him
<EOS>
,
for
he
must
certainly
be
very
bad
from
have
eat
last
night
such
a
vast
quantity
of
raw
oyster
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
crusty
gentleman
,
who
from
the
solemnity
of
his
delivery
,
expect
something
extraordinary
,
no
sooner
hear
his
conclusion
,
than
he
start
up
in
a
testy
humour
,
cry
,
"
Pshaw
,
pshaw
!
<EOS>
d####n
your
oyster
;
"
and
walk
away
after
a
short
compliment
of
"
Your
servant
,
Sir
,
"
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
get
up
also
,
say
,
"
I
vow
and
protest
,
upon
my
word
,
I
be
actually
amazed
.
"
 
and
follow
Mr
Medlar
to
the
bar
,
which
be
hard
by
,
where
he
be
pay
for
the
coffee
;
there
he
whisper
so
loud
that
I
could
over
-
hear
,
"
pray
,
who
be
this
gentleman
?
"
 
<EOS>
His
friend
reply
hastily
,
"
I
may
have
know
that
before
now
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
your
impertinent
intrusion
,
"
 
and
walk
away
very
much
disappointed
.
     
<EOS>
the
ceremonious
physician
return
immediately
and
sit
down
by
me
,
ask
a
thousand
pardon
for
leave
me
alone
;
and
give
me
to
understand
that
what
he
have
communicate
to
Mr
Medlar
at
the
bar
be
an
affair
of
the
last
importance
,
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
call
for
some
coffee
,
and
launch
out
into
the
virtue
of
that
berry
,
which
,
he
say
,
in
cold
phlegmatic
constitution
,
like
his
,
dry
up
the
superfluous
moisture
,
and
brace
the
relaxed
nerve
.
 
<EOS>
He
let
me
know
,
that
it
be
utterly
unknown
to
the
ancient
;
and
derive
its
name
from
an
arabian
word
,
which
I
may
easily
perceive
by
the
sound
and
termination
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
topick
he
transfer
his
disquisition
to
the
verb
drink
,
which
he
affirm
,
be
improperly
apply
to
the
taking
of
coffee
,
in
as
much
as
people
do
not
drink
,
but
sip
or
sipple
that
liquour
;
 
that
the
genuine
meaning
of
drinking
be
to
quench
one
's
thirst
,
or
commit
a
debauch
by
swallow
wine
;
 
that
the
latin
word
,
which
convey
the
same
idea
,
be
bibere
or
potare
,
and
that
of
the
Greeks
pinein
or
poteein
,
though
he
be
apt
to
believe
they
be
differently
use
on
different
occasion
:
<EOS>
for
example
;
to
drink
a
vast
quantity
,
or
,
as
the
vulgar
express
it
,
to
drink
an
ocean
of
liquor
,
be
in
latin
potare
,
and
in
greek
poteein
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
to
use
it
moderately
,
be
bibere
and
pinein
;
 
that
this
be
only
a
conjecture
of
his
own
,
which
,
however
,
seem
to
be
support
by
the
word
bibulous
,
which
be
particularly
apply
to
the
pore
of
the
skin
,
that
can
only
drink
a
very
small
quantity
of
the
circumambient
moisture
,
by
reason
of
the
smallness
of
their
diameter
;
 
whereas
,
from
the
verb
poteein
,
be
derive
the
substantive
potamo
,
which
signify
a
river
,
or
vast
quantity
of
liquor
.
     
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smile
at
this
learned
and
important
investigation
;
and
to
recommend
myself
the
more
to
my
new
acquaintance
,
whose
disposition
I
be
by
this
time
well
informed
of
<EOS>
,
I
observe
,
that
what
he
alledge
,
do
not
,
to
the
good
of
my
remembrance
,
appear
in
the
writing
of
the
ancient
;
for
,
Horace
use
the
word
poto
and
bibo
indifferently
for
the
same
purpose
,
as
in
the
twentieth
Ode
of
his
first
Book
.
    
<EOS>
Vile
potabis
modicis
sabinum
cantharis
,
      
<EOS>
Et
praelo
domitam
caleno
tu
bibes

.
    
<EOS>
that
I
have
never
hear
of
the
verb
poteein
,
but
that
potamos
,
potema
,
and
poto
,
be
derive
from
pino
,
poso
,
pepoka
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
greek
poet
never
use
any
other
word
for
festal
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
Homer
describe
Nestor
at
his
cup
in
these
word
:
Nestora
d
'
ouk
elathen
jache
pinonta
perempes
.
    
<EOS>
and
Anacreon
mention
it
on
the
same
occasion
almost
in
every
page
,
Pionti

Otan

<EOS>
Opliz

<EOS>
and
in
a
thousand
other
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
who
,
doubtless
,
intend
by
his
criticism
,
to
give
me
an
high
idea
of
his
erudition
,
be
infinitely
surprize
to
find
himself
school
by
one
in
my
appearance
;
and
after
a
considerable
pause
,
cry
,
"
upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
you
be
in
the
right
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
have
not
consider
this
affair
with
my
usual
accuracy
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
then
accost
me
,
in
Latin
,
which
he
speak
very
well
,
the
conversation
be
maintain
full
two
hour
,
on
a
variety
of
subject
,
in
that
language
;
and
indeed
,
he
speak
so
judiciously
,
that
I
be
convince
,
notwithstanding
his
whimsical
appearance
,
and
attention
to
trifle
,
of
his
be
a
man
of
extensive
knowledge
,
especially
in
book
<EOS>
;
he
look
upon
upon
me
,
as
I
afterwards
understand
from
Mr
Medlar
,
as
a
prodigy
in
learning
,
and
propose
that
very
night
,
if
I

XLVI
Wagtail
introduce
me
to
a
set
of
fine
gentleman
,
with
whom
I
spend
the
evening
at
a
tavern
 
our
conversation
 
<EOS>
the
character
of
my
new
companion
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
roast
 
the
issue
of
our
debauch
.
  
<EOS>
I
accept
his
offer
with
pleasure
,
and
we
go
thither
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
where
I
see
a
great
number
of
gay
figure
flutter
about
,
most
of
whom
speak
to
the
doctor
with
great
familiarity
.
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
stand
a
groupe
of
them
around
the
fire
,
whom
I
immediately
know
to
be
the
very
person
who
have
the
night
before
,
by
their
laughing
,
alarm
my
suspicion
of
the
lady
who
have
put
herself
under
my
protection
.
     
<EOS>
They
no
sooner
perceive
me
enter
with
Dr
Wagtail
<EOS>
(
for
that
be
my
companion
's
name
)
than
they
titter
and
whisper
one
to
another
;
and
I
be
not
a
little
surprized
to
find
that
they
be
the
gentleman
to
whose
acquaintance
he
design
to
recommend
me
;
for
when
he
observe
them
together
,
he
tell
me
who
they
be
,
and
desire
to
know
by
what
name
he
should
introduce
me
.
<EOS>
I
satisfy
him
in
that
particular
,
and
he
advance
with
great
gravity
,
say
,
"
gentleman
,
your
most
obedient
 
give
me
leave
to
introduce
my
friend
Mr
Random
,
to
your
society
.
"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
me
,
"
Mr
Random
,
this
be
Mr
Bragwell
 
<EOS>
Mr
Banter
,
Sir
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chatter
 
<EOS>
my
friend
Mr
Slyboot
,
and
Mr
Ranter
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
salute
each
of
them
in
order
,
and
when
I
come
to
take
Mr
Slyboot
by
the
hand
,
I
perceive
him
thrust
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
,
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
the
company
;
but
I
do
not
think
proper
to
take
any
notice
of
it
,
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Ranter
too
,
<EOS>
(
who
I
afterwards
learn
be
a
player
)
<EOS>
display
his
talent
,
by
mimic
my
air
,
feature
and
voice
,
while
he
return
my
compliment
:
 
this
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
be
so
sensible
of
<EOS>
,
have
I
not
see
him
behave
in
the
same
manner
,
to
my
friend
Wagtail
,
when
he
make
up
to
them
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
once
I
let
him
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
dexterity
without
question
or
controul
,
resolve
however
,
to
chastize
his
insolence
at
a
more
convenient
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Slyboot
<EOS>
guess
<EOS>
I
be
a
stranger
,
ask
if
I
have
be
lately
in
France
;
and
when
I
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
enquire
if
I
have
see
the
Luxemburg
gallery
<EOS>
:
I
tell
him
,
I
have
consider
it
more
than
once
,
with
great
attention
:
upon
this
a
conversation
ensue
,
in
which
I
discover
him
to
be
a
painter
.
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
discourse
upon
the
particular
piece
of
this
famous
collection
,
I
overhear
Banter
ask
Dr
Wagtail
,
where
he
have
pick
up
this
Mr
Random
.
     
<EOS>
to
which
question
the
physician
answer
,
"
upon
my
word
,
a
mighty
pretty
sort
of
a
gentleman
 
a
man
of
fortune
,
Sir
 
he
have
make
the
grand
tour
 
and
see
the
good
company
in
Europe
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
he
tell
you
so
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
(
say
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
take
him
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
french
valet
de
chambre
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
barbarous
,
barbarous
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
doctor
)
<EOS>
this
be
actually
,
upon
my
word
,
altogether
unaccountable
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
his
family
perfectly
well
,
Sir
 
<EOS>
He
be
of
the
Randoms
in
the
north
 
a
very
ancient
house
,
Sir
,
and
a
distant
relation
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
extremely
nettle
at
the
conjecture
of
Mr
Banter
,
and
begin
to
entertain
a
very
indifferent
opinion
of
my
company
in
general
;
but
as
I
may
possibly
,
by
their
mean
,
acquire
a
more
extensive
and
agreeable
acquaintance
,
I
determine
to
bear
these
little
mortification
as
long
as
I
could
,
without
injure
the
dignity
of
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
after
have
talk
for
some
time
on
the
weather
,
play
,
politick
,
and
other
coffee
-
house
subject
,
it
be
propose
that
we
should
spend
the
evening
at
a
noted
tavern
in
the
neighborhood
,
whither
we
repair
in
a
body
.
 
<EOS>
have
take
possession
of
a
room
,
call
for
french
wine
,
and
bespoke
supper
,
the
glass
go
about
pretty
freely
,
and
the
character
of
my
associate
open
upon
me
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
appear
that
the
doctor
be
entertain
as
a
butt
for
the
painter
and
player
to
exercise
their
wit
upon
,
for
the
diversion
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Mr
Ranter
begin
the
game
,
by
ask
him
what
be
good
for
a
hoarseness
,
lowness
of
spirit
and
indigestion
,
he
be
trouble
with
all
these
complaint
to
a
very
great
degree
.
     
<EOS>
Wagtail
immediately
undertake
to
explain
the
nature
of
his
case
,
and
in
a
very
prolix
manner
,
harrangue
upon
prognostic
,
diagnostic
,
symptomatic
,
therapeutic
,
inanition
,
and
repletion
;
then
calculate
the
force
of
the
stomach
and
lung
in
their
respective
operation
;
ascribe
the
player
's
malady
to
a
disorder
in
these
organ
,
proceed
from
hard
drinking
and
vociferation
,
and
prescribe
a
course
of
stomachic
,
with
abstinence
from
venery
,
wine
,
and
loud
speak
,
laughing
,
singing
,
coughing
,
sneeze
or
hollowing

Ranter

the

bad

the

<EOS>
I
wish
I
know
where
to

Water

an

impart

pardon
me
(
cry
the

)
<EOS>
it

by
Solomon

as
appear
by
a
greek
manuscript
,
in
his
own
hand

writing
,
lately
find
at
the
foot
of
mount
Lebanon
,
by
a
peasant
who

well
,
(
say
Wagtail
)
<EOS>
in
all
my
vast
reading
,
I
never
meet
with
such
a
preparation
!
<EOS>
neither
do
I
know
till
this
minute
,
that
Solomon
understand
Greek
,
or
that
potato
grow
in
Palestine
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
Banter
interpose
,
say
,
he
be
surprize
that
doctor
Wagtail
should
make
the
least
doubt
of
Solomon
's
understanding
Greek
,
when
he
be
represent
to
us
as
the
wise
and
best
educate
prince
in
the
world
;
and
as
for
potato
,
they
be
transplant
thither
from
Ireland
,
in
the
time
of
the
Crusades
,
by
some
knight
of
that
country
.
     
<EOS>
"
I
profess
(
say
the
doctor
)
there
be
nothing
more
likely
 
<EOS>
I
would
actually
give
a
vast
sum
for
a
sight
of
that
manuscript
,
which
must
be
inestimable
 
and
if
I
understand
the
process
,
would
set
about
it
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
player
assure
him
,
the
process
be
very
simple
 
that
he
must
cram
a
hundred
weight
of
dry
tinder
into
a
glass
retort
,
and
distil
it
by
the
force
of
animal
heat
,
it
would
yield
half
a
scruple
of
insipid
water
,
one
drop
of
which
be
a
full
dose
.
 
<EOS>
"
upon
my
integrity
!
<EOS>
(
exclaim
the
credulous
doctor
)
<EOS>
this
be
very
amazing
and
extraordinary
!
<EOS>
that
a
caput
mortuum
shall
yield
any
water
at
all
 
I
must
own
<EOS>
,
I
have
always
be
an
enemy
to
specific
,
which
I
think
inconsistent
with
the
nature
of
the
animal
oeconomy
;
but
certainly
the
authority
of
Solomon
be
not
to
be
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
I
shall
find
a
glass
retort
large
enough
to
contain
such
a
vast
quantity
of
tinder
,
the
consumption
of
which
must
undoubtedly
raise
the
price
of
paper
 
or
where
shall
I
find
animal
heat
sufficient
,
even
to
warm
such
a
mass
.
"
 
<EOS>
Slyboot
inform
him
,
that
he
may
have
a
retort
blow
for
him
as
big
as
a
church
,
and
that
the
easy
method
of
raise
the
vapour
by
animal
heat
,
would
be
to
place
it
in
the
middle
of
an
infirmary
for
feverish
patient
,
who
may
lie
upon
matrasse
around
,
and
in
contact
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
pronounce
these
word
,
than
Wagtail
exclaim
in
a
rapture
,
"
an
admirable
expedient
,
as
I
hope
to
be
save
!
<EOS>
I
will
positively
put
it
in
practice
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
simplicity
of
the
physician
furnish
excellent
diversion
for
the
company

who
in
their
turn
,
sneer
at
him

ironical
compliment

vanity
swallow

genuine

Mr

break
out

us
with

catalogue
of
all
the

dance
at

circumstantial

You

I

represent

pink

without
endanger
his
life

that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
of
take
a
good
clever
agony
from
nature

<EOS>
the
doctor
will
direct
you
where
to
enter
,
and
how
far
to
go
;
but
pray
let
it
be
as
near
the
left
side
as
possible

"
 
<EOS>
Wagtail
,
who
take
this
proposal
seriously

observe
,
that
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
matter
to
penetrate
into
the
left
side
of
the
thorax
,
without
hurt
the
heart
,
and
of
consequence
kill
the
patient
;
but
he
believe
it
be
possible
for
a
man
of
a
very
nice
hand
,
and
exact
knowledge
of
anatomy
,
to
wound
the
diaphragma
somewhere
about
the
skirt
,
which
may
induce
a
singultus

without
be
attend
with
death

that
he
be
ready
to
demonstrate
the
insertion
of
that
muscle
to
Mr
Bragwell

desire

have
no
concern

the
experiment

which
may
essentially
prejudice
his

Bragwell
be
as
much
impose

lay
it
down

<EOS>
(
cry
Banter
)
<EOS>
would
you
be
so
impolite
as
to
refuse
a
lady
the
hearing
?
<EOS>
perhaps
she
come
for
a
consultation
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
some
extraordinary
affair
that
bring
a
lady
to
a
tavern
at
this
time
o'night
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Ranter
,
pray
do
the
doctor
's
baise

main
to
the

and
squire

"
 
<EOS>
the
player
immediately
stagger
out
,
and
return
,
lead
in
with
much
ceremony
,
a
tall
strap
wench
,
whose
appearance
proclaim
her
condition

<EOS>
We
receive
her
with
the
utmost
solemnity
,
and
with
a
good
deal
of
intreaty
she
be
persuade
to
sit
,
when
a
prosound
silence
ensue
,
during
which
she
fix
her
eye
,
with
a
disconsolate
look
,
upon
the
doctor
,
who
be
utterly
confound
at
her
behaviour
,
and
return
her
melancholy
sour
-
fold
;
at
length
,
after
a
good
many
piteous
sigh
,
she
wipe
her
eye
,
and
accost
him
thus
:
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
not
one
word
of
comfort
?
<EOS>
Will
nothing
soften
that
stony
heart
of
thine
?
<EOS>
not
all
my
tear
!
<EOS>
not
all
my
affliction
!
<EOS>
not
the
inevitable
ruin
thou
hast
bring
upon
me
!
<EOS>
where
be
thy
vow
,
thou
faithless
perjure
man
?
 
<EOS>
Hast
thou
<EOS>
no
honour

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
answer
me

do
me
justice

or
must
I
have
recourse
to
heaven
and
hell
for
my
revenge
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
if
poor
Wagtail
be
amazed
before
she
speak
,
what
must
his
confusion
be
on
hear
this
address
.
<EOS>
His
natural
paleness
change
into
a
ghastly
clay
colour
,
his
eye
roll
,
his
lip
tremble
,
and
he
answer
in
an
accent
not
to
be
describe
;
 
"
upon

<EOS>
madam

you

<EOS>
gentleman
,
since
the
villain
compel
me
,
by
his
unkindness

to

him
,
know
,
that
this
betrayer
,
under
the
specious
pretence

address
,
win
my

and
take
advantage
of
his
conquest
,
rob
me
of
my
virgin
treasure

afterwards
abandon
me
to
my
fate

<EOS>
I
be
now
four
month
go
with
child
by
him

turn
out

door
by
my

leave
a
prey

want

<EOS>
yes

thou
Barbarian

say
she
,
turn
to
Wagtail
)
<EOS>
thou
tiger
,
thou
Succubus
!
<EOS>
too
well
thou
knowest
my

but
I
will
tear
out
thy
faithless

,
and
deliver
the
world
from
such
a
monster
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
spring
forward
at
the
doctor
,
who
,
with
incredible
agility
,
jump
over
the
table
and
get
behind
Bragwell
,
while
the
rest
of
us
endeavour
to
appease
the
furious
heroine
 
<EOS>
although
every
body
in
the
company
affect
the
utmost
surprize
,
I
could
easily
perceive
it
be
a
scheme
concert
among
them
,
to
produce
diversion
at
the
doctor
's
expence
;
and
be
under
no
concern
about
the
consequence
,
I
enter
into
the
confederacy
,
and
<EOS>
enjoy'd
the
distress
of
Wagtail
,
who
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
beg
the
protection
of
the
company
,
declare
himself
as
innocent
of
the
crime
lay
to
his
charge
,
as
the
foetus
in
utero
;
and
hint
at
the
same
time
,
that
nature
have
not
put
it
in
his
power
to
be
guilty
of
such
a
trespass
 
"
Nature
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
lady
,
)
<EOS>
there
be
no
nature
in
the
case
 
<EOS>
he
abuse
me
by
the
help
of
charm
and
spell
;
<EOS>
else
how
be
it
possible
,
that
any
woman
could
have
listen
to
the
address
of
such
a
scarecrow
?
 
<EOS>
be
these
owlish
eye
make
for
ogle
;
<EOS>
that
carrion
complexion
to
be
admire
;
or
that
mouth
like
a
horse

shoe
to
be
kiss
?
    
<EOS>
no
,
<EOS>
no
,
you
owe
your
success
to
your
philtre
,
to
your
drug
and
incantation
;
and
not
to
your
natural
talent
,
which
be
in
every
respect
<EOS>
mean
and
contemptible
"
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
now
think
he
have
get
an
opportunity
of
vindicate
himself
effectually
;
and
desire
the
complainant
to
compose
herself
but
for
half
an
hour
,
in
which
he
undertake
to
prove
the
absurdity
of
believe
in
the
power
of
incantation
,
which
be
only
idle
dream
of
ignorance
and
superstition
.
 
<EOS>
He
accordingly
pronounce
a
very
learned
discourse
upon
the
nature
of
idea
,
the
power
and
independance
of
the
mind
,
the
property
of
stimulate
medicine
,
the
difference
between
a
proneness
to
venery
,
which
many
simple
would
create
,
and
a
passion
limit
to
one
object
,
which
can
only
be
the
result
of
sense
and
reflection
;
and
conclude
with
a
pathetic
remonstrance
,
set
forth
his
unhappiness
of
be
persecute
with
the
resentment
of
a
lady
whom
he
have
never
injure
,
nor
even
see
before
that
occasion
,
and
whose
faculty
be
,
in
all
likelihood
,
so
much
impair
by
her
misfortune
,
that
an
innocent
person
be
in
danger
of
be
ruin
by
her
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
finish
his
harrangue
,
than
the
forlorn
princess
begin
her
lamentation
afresh
,
and
caution
the
company
against
his
eloquence
,
which
;
she
say
,
be
able
to
byass
the
most
impartial
bench
in
christendom
.
 
<EOS>
Banter
advise
him
to
espouse
her
immediately
,
as
the
only
mean
to
salve
his
reputation
,
and
offer
to
accompany
him
to
the
Fleet
for
that
purpose
;
but
Slyboot
propose
that
a
father
should
be
purchase
for
the
child
,
and
a
comfortable
alimony
settle
on
the
mother
.
<EOS>
Ranter
promise
to
adopt
the
infant
gratis
.
<EOS>
Wagtail
be
ready
to
worship
him
for
his
generosity
;
and
though
he
persist
in
protest
his
innocence
,
condescend
to
every
thing
rather
than
his
unblemished
character
should
be
call
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
reject
the
expedient
,
and
insist
on
matrimony
.
    
<EOS>
Bragwell
take
up
the
cudgel
for
the
doctor
,
and
undertake
to
rid
him
of
her
importunity
,
for
half
a
guinea
;
<EOS>
upon
which
Wagtail
,
with
great
eagerness
,
pull
out
his
purse
and
put
it
into
the
hand
of
his
friend
,
who
take
half
a
piece
out
of
it
,
give
it
to
the
plaintiff
,
and
bid
her
thank
God
for
her
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
receive
this
bounty
,
she
affect
to
weep
,
and
beg
,
since
the
physician
have
renounce
her
,
he
would
at
least
vouchsafe
her
a
part
kiss
;
this
he
be
prevail
upon
to
grant
,
with
great
reluctance
,
and
go
up
,
with
his
usual
solemnity
,
to
salute
her
;
she
lay
hold
of
his
cheek
with
her
tooth
and
hold
fast
,
while
he
roar
with
anguish
,
to
the
unspeakable
diversion
of
all
present
.
<EOS>
when
she
think
proper
to
release
him
,
she
drop
a
low
courtesy
to
the
company
,
and
quit
the
room
,
leave
the
doctor
in
the
utmost
horror
,
not
so
much
on
account
of
the
pain
,
as
the
apprehension
of
the
consequence
of
the
bite
;
for
by
this
time
,
he
be
convince
of
her
be
mad
.
<EOS>
banter
prescribe
the
actual
cautery
,
and
put
the
poker
in
the
fire
to
be
heat
,
in
order
to
fear
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
player
be
of
opinion
that
Bragwell
should
scoop
out
the
part
affect
with
the
point
of
his
sword
;
but
the
painter
prevent
both
these
dreadful
operation
,
by
recommend
a
balsam
he
have
in
his
pocket
,
which
never
fail
to
cure
the
bite
of
a
mad
dog
:
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
he
pull
out
a
small
bladder
of
black
paint
,
with
which
he
instantly
anoint
not
only
the
sore
,
but
the
great
part
of
the
patient
's
face
,
and
leave
it
in
a
frightful
condition
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
poor
creature
be
so
harrasse
with
fear
and
vexation
,
that
I
pity
him
extremely
,
and
send
him
home
in
a
chair
,
contrary
to
the
inclination
of
every
body
present
.
    
<EOS>
this
freedom
of
mine
,
give
umbrage
to
Bragwell
,
who
testify
his
displeasure
,
by
swear
a
few
threat
,
without
make
any
application
;
which
be
no
sooner
perceive
by
Slyboot
,
who
sit
by
me
,
than
with
a
view
of
promote
a
quarrel
,
he
whisper
to
me
,
that
he
think
Bragwell
use
me
very
ill
;
but
every
man
be
the
good
judge
of
his
own
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
aloud
,
that
I
would
neither
suffer
Mr
Bragwell
nor
him
to
use
me
ill
with
impunity
;
and
that
I
stand
in
no
need
of
his
counsel
in
regard
to
the
regulation
of
my
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
proper
to
ask
a
thousand
pardon
,
and
assure
me
,
he
mean
no
offence
;
while
Bragwell
feign
himself
asleep
,
that
he
may
not
be
oblige
to
take
notice
of
what
pass
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
player
,
who
have
more
animal
spirit
,
and
less
prudence
than
Slyboot
,
unwilling
to
let
the
affair
rest
,
where
he
have
dropt
it
,
jog
Mr
Bragwell
,
and
tell
him
softly
,
that
I
call
him
name
,
and
threatne
to
cudgel
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
understand
by
his
start
up
and
cry
,
"
blood
and
wound
!
<EOS>
you
lie
 
<EOS>
no
man
durst
treat
me
so
ignominiously
,
 
Mr
Random
,
do
you
call
me
name
,
and
threaten
to
drub
me
?
"
    
<EOS>
I
deny
the
imputation
,
and
propose
to
punish
the
scoundrel
,
who
endeavour
to
foment
disturbance
in
the
company
;
Bragwell
signify
his
approbation
,
and
draw
his
sword
;
I
do
the
same
,
and
accost
the
actor
in
these
word
,
"
Lookee
,
Mr
Banter
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
possess
all
the
mimickry
and
mischievous
quality
of
an
ape
,
because
I
have
observe
you
put
them
all
in
practice
more
than
once
to
-
night
,
on
me
and
other
;
now
I
want
to
see
if
you
resemble
one
in
nimbleness
also
;
therefore
I
desire
you
to
leap
over
this
sword
without
hesitation
;
"
so
say
,
I
hold
it
parallel
to
the
horizon
,
at
the
distance
of
about
three
foot
from
the
floor
,
and
call
,
"
once
 
twice
 
thrice
,
and
away
;
"
 
but
instead
of
comply
with
my
command
,
he
snatch
his
hat
and
hanger
,
and
assume
the
look
,
swagger
,
and
phrase
of
Pistol
,
burst
out
in
the
following
exclamation
,
"

"
 
<EOS>
this
buffoonery
do
not
answer
his
expectation
,
for
by
this
time
the
company
be
bent
on
see
him
in
a
new
character
.
<EOS>
Mr
Banter
desire
me
to
hold
my
sword
a
foot
or
two
high
,
that
he
may
have
the
well
opportunity
of
exert
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
painter
tell
him
,
if
he
perform
well
,
he
would
recommend
him
as
a
vaulter
to
the
proprietor
of
Sadler
's
well
;
and
Bragwell
crying
,
"
Leap
for
the
king
,
"
apply
the
point
of
his
sword
to
the
player
's
posterior
,
with
such
success
,
that
he
spring
over
in
a
trice
,
and
find
the
door
unguarded
,
vanish
in
a
twinkling
;
glad
,
no

of
have
pay
his

so
easily

me
by
the

with
many
compliment
and
procession
of

for

Banter
come
to
my
lodging
,
be
very
sarcastic
at
my
expence
,
and
borrow
five
guinea
from
me
,
as
a
proof
of
his
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
before
I
get
up
,
Strap
come
into
my
chamber
,
and
find
me
awake
,
hem
several
time
,
scratch
his
head
,
cast
his
eye
upon
the
ground
,
and
with
a
very
foolish
kind
of
a
simper
on
his
face
,
let
me
know
he
have
something
to
communicate
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
your
countenance
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
I
expect
to
hear
good
tiding

Indifferent
(
reply
he
,
titter
)
<EOS>
that
is
,
thereafter
as
it
shall
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
have
some
thought
of
alter
my
condition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
(
cry
I
,
astonish
)
a
matrimonial
scheme
?
    
<EOS>
o
rare
Strap
!
<EOS>
thou
hast
get
the
heel
of
me
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
N
'
 
no
less
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
(
say
he
,
burst
into
a
laugh
of
self
-
approbation
)
a
tallow
-
chandler
's
widow
,
that
live
hard
by
,
have
take
a
liking
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
a
fine
jolly
dame
,
as
plump
as
a
partridge
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
well
furnished
house
,
a
brisk
trade
,
and
a
good
deal
of
the
ready
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
her
for
the
asking
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
a
friend
of
mine
,
a
brother
footman
,
that
she
would
take
me
out
of
a
stinking
clout
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
refuse
to
give
my
final
answer
,
till
I
know
your
opinion
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
congratulate
Monsieur
d'Estrapes
upon
his
conquest
,
and
approve
of
the
scheme
,
provide
he
could
be
assure
of
these
circumstance
of
her
fortune
;
but
advise
him
to
do
nothing
rashly
,
and
give
me
an
opportunity
of
see
the
lady
before
matter
should
be
bring
to
a
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
He
assure
me
he
would
do
nothing
without
my
consent
and
approbation
,
and
that
very
morning
,
while
I
be
at
breakfast
,
introduce
his
innamorata
to
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
short
thick
woman
,
about
the
age
of
thirty
-
six
,
and
have
a
particular
prominence
of
belly
,
which
I
perceive
at
first
sight
,
not
without
some
suspicion
of
foul
play
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
her
,
however
,
to
sit
,
and
treat
her
with
a
dish
of
tea
;
the
discourse
turn
on
the
good
quality
of
Strap
,
whom
I
represent
as
a
prodigy
of
sobriety
,
industry
and
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
take
her
leave
,
he
follow
her
to
the
door
,
and
return
lick
his
lip
,
and
ask
if
I
do
not
think
she
be
a
luscious
creature
.
     
<EOS>
I
make
no
mystery
of
my
apprehension
,
but
declare
my
sentiment
of
her
without
reserve
;
at
which
he
be
not
surprize
,
tell
me
,
he
have
observe
the
same
symptom
,
but
be
inform
by
his
friend
that
she
be
only
livergrown
,
and
would
in
a
few
month
be
as
small
in
the
Waist
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
a
few
week
,
I
believe
,
will
do
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
Strap
,
it
be
my
opinion
,
that
you
be
egregiously
impose
upon
;
and
that
this
friend
be
no
other
than
a
rascal
who
want
to
palm
his
trull
upon
you
for
a
wife
,
that
he
may
at
once
deliver
himself
from
the
importunity
of
the
mother
,
and
the
expence
of
her
bantling
;
for
which
reason
I
would
not
have
you
trust
implicitly
to
the
report
he
make
of
her
wealth
,
which
be
inconsistent
with
his
behaviour
;
nor
run
your
head
precipitately
into
a
noose
,
that
you
may
afterwards
wish
exchange
for
the
hangman
's
.
"
<EOS>
He
seem
very
much
start
at
my
insinuation
,
and
promise
to
look
twice
before
he
leap
;
say
,
with
some
heat
,
"
Odd
,
if
I
find
his
intention
be
to
betray
me
,
we
shall
see
which
of
us
be
the
well
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
prediction
be
verify
in
less
than
a
fortnight
;
<EOS>
her
great
belly
produce
an
infant
,
to
the
unspeakable
amazement
of
Strap
,
who
be
,
before
this
happen
,
inclinable
to
believe
I
have
refine
a
little
too
much
in
my
penetration
.
<EOS>
His
false
friend
disappear
,
and
in
a
few
day
after
,
an
execution
be
issue
against
her
good
and
household
-
furniture
,
which
be
seize
by
the
creditor
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
I
meet
my
friend
Banter
at
the
ordinary
,
and
in
the
evening
go
to
the
opera
with
him
and
Mr
Chatter
,
who
point
out
Melinda
in
one
of
the
box
,
and
offer
to
introduce
me
to
her
,
observe
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
be
a
reign
toast
worth
<EOS>
ten
thousand
pound
.
     
<EOS>
this
piece
of
information
make
my
heart
bind
with
joy
,
and
I
discover
great
eagerness
to
accept
the
proposal
;
upon
which
he
assure
me
I
should
dance
with
her
at
the
next
assembly
,
if
he
have
any
influence
in
that
quarter
;
so
say
,
he
go
round
,
speak
to
her
some
minute
,
and
,
as
I
imagine
,
point
at
me
,
then
return
,
tell
me
,
to
my
inexpressible
pleasure
,
that
I
may
depend
upon
what
he
have
promise
,
for
she
be
now
engage
as
my
partner
.
 
<EOS>
Banter
,
in
a
whisper
,
give
me
to
understand
that
she
be
an
incorrigible
coquette
,
who
would
grant
the
same
favour
to
any
young
fellow
in
England
,
of
a
tolerable
appearance
,
merely
to
engage
him
among
the
herd
of
her
admirer
,
that
she
may
have
the
pleasure
of
see
them
increase
daily
;
 
that
she
be
of
a
cold
insensible
disposition
,
dead
to
every
passion
but
vanity
,
and
so
blind
to
merit
,
that
he
would
lay
any
wager
,
the
wealthy
fool
should
carry
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
attribute
a
good
deal
of
this
intelligence
to
the
satirical
turn
of
my
friend
,
or
resentment
,
for
have
himself
suffer
a
rebuff
from
the
lady
in
question
;
and
at
any
rate
,
trust
so
much
to
my
own
accomplishment
,
as
to
believe
no
woman
could
resist
the
ardour
of
my
address
.
    
<EOS>
full
of
this
confidence
,
I
repair
to
Hampstead
,
in
company
with
Billy
Chatter
,
my
Lord
Hobble
,
and
doctor
Wagtail
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
see
a
very
brilliant
assembly
,
before
whom
I
have
the
honour
to
walk
a
minuet
with
Melinda
,
who
charm
me
with
her
frank
manner
of
receive
me
,
and
easiness
of
behaviour
.
     
<EOS>
before
the
country
dance
begin
,
I
receive
a
message
by
a
person
I
do
not
know
,
from
Bragwell
,
who
be
present
,
import
that
no
body
who
know
him
,
presume
to
dance
with
Melinda
,
while
he
be
there
in
person
;
and
that
I
would
do
well
to
relinquish
her
without
noise
,
because
he
have
a
mind
to
lead
up
a
country
dance
with
her
.
<EOS>
this
extraordinary
intimation
,
which
be
deliver
in
the
lady
's
hearing
,
do
not
at
all
discompose
me
,
who
by
this
time
be
pretty
well
acquaint
with
the
character
of
my
rival
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
,
without
the
least
symptom
of
concern
,
bid
the
gentleman
tell
Mr
Bragwell
,
that
while
I
be
so
happy
as
to
obtain
the
lady
's
consent
,
I
should
not
be
sollicitous
about
his
;
and
desire
the
bearer
himself
to
bring
me
no
such
impertinent
message
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
Melinda
affect
a
sort
of
confusion
,
and
pretend
to
wonder
that
Mr
Bragwell
should
give
himself
such
liberty
with
regard
to
her
,
who
have
no
manner
of
connexion
with
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
lay
hold
of
this
opportunity
to
display
my
valour
,
and
offer
to
call
him
to
account
for
his
insolence
,
which
she
absolutely
refuse
,
under
pretence
of
consult
my
safety
;
though
I
could
perceive
by
the
sparkling
of
her
eye
,
that
she
would
not
have
think
herself
affront
in
be
the
subject
of
a
duel
.
<EOS>
I
be
by
no
mean
pleased
with
this
discovery
of
her
thought
,
which
not
only
argue
the
most
unjustifiable
vanity
,
but
likewise
the
most
barbarous
indifference
;
however
,
I
be
allure
by
her
fortune
,
and
resolve
to
gratify
her
pride
,
in
make
her
the
occasion
of
a
publick
quarrel
between
me
and
Bragwell
,
who
,
I
be
pretty
certain
,
would
never
drive
matter
to
a
dangerous
extremity
.
    
<EOS>
while
we
dance
together
,
I
observe
this
formidable
rival
at
one
end
of
the
room
,
encircle
with
a
cluster
of
beaus
,
to
whom
he
talk
with
great
vehemence
,
cast
many
big
look
at
me
,
from
time
to
time
:
    
I
guess
the
subject
of
his
discourse
,
and
as
soon
as
I
have
hand
my
partner
to
her
seat
,
strut
up
to
the
place
where
he
stand
,
and
cock
my
hat
in
his
face
,
demand
aloud
,
if
he
have
any
thing
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
answer
with
a
sullen
tone
,
"
nothing
,
at
present
,
Sir
,
"
and
turn
about
upon
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
you
know
where
I
be
to
be
find
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
companion
stare
at
one
another
,
and
I
return
to
the
lady
,
whose
feature
brighten
at
my
approach
,
and
immediately
a
whisper
run
thro
'
the
whole
room
;
after
which
,
so
many
eye
be
turn
upon
me
,
that
I
be
ready
to
sink
with
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
ball
break
up
,
I
lead
her
to
her
coach
,
and
,
like
a
true
french
gallant
,
would
have
get
up
behind
it
,
in
order
to
protect
her
from
violence
on
the
road
;
but
she
absolutely
refuse
my
offer
,
and
express
her
concern
that
there
be
not
an
empty
seat
for
me
within
it
.
    
<EOS>
next
day
in
the
afternoon
I
wait
on
her
at
her
lodging
,
by
permission
,
in
company
with
Chatter
,
and
be
very
civilly
receive
by
her
mother
,
with
whom
she
live
;
 
there
be
a
good
many
fashionable
people
present
,
chiefly
young
fellow
,
and
immediately
after
tea
a
couple
of
card
table
be
set
,
at
one
of
which
I
have
the
honour
to
play
with
Melinda
,
who
in
less
than
three
hour
make
shift
to
plunder
me
of
eight
guinea
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
well
enough
content
to
lose
a
little
money
with
a
good
grace
,
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
to
say
-
soft
thing
in
the
mean
time
,
which
be
still
most
welcome
,
when
attend
with
good
luck
;
but
I
be
by
no
mean
satisfied
with
her
fair
play
,
a
circumstance
that
shock
me
not
a
little
,
and
greatly
impair
my
opinion
of
her
disinterestedness
and
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
resolve
to
profit
by
this
behaviour
,
and
treat
her
in
my
turn
with
less
ceremony
;
accordingly
,
I
lay
close
siege
to
her
,
and
find
her
not
at
all
disgust
with
the
gross
incense
I
offer
,
that
very
night
make
a
declaration
of
love
in
plain
term
.
 
<EOS>
She
receive
my
address
with
great
gaity
,
and
pretend
to
laugh
them
off
,
but
at
the
same
time
treat
me
with
such
particular
complacency
,
that
I
be
persuade
I
have
make
a
conquest
of
her
heart
,
and
conclude
myself
the
happy
man
alive
.
 
<EOS>
elevate
with
these
flattering
idea
,
I
sit
down
again
to
card
,
after
supper
,
and
with
great
chearfulness
suffer
myself
to
be
cheat
of
ten
guinea
more
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
late
before
I
take
my
leave
,
after
be
favour
with
a
general
invitation
;
and
when
I
get
into
bed
,
the
adventure
of
the
day
hinder
me
from
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
please
myself
with
the
hope
of
possess
a
fine
woman
with
ten
thousand
pound
;
then
I
would
ruminate
on
the
character
I
have
hear
of
her
from
Banter
,
and
compare
it
with
the
circumstance
of
her
conduct
towards
me
,
which
seem
to
bear
too
great
a
resemblance
to
the
picture
he
have
draw
.
 
<EOS>
this
introduce
a
melancholy
reflection
on
the
expence
I
have
undergo
,
and
the
smallness
of
my
fund
to
support
it
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
be
none
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
find
myself
involved
in
doubt
and
perplexity
,
that
keep
me
awake
the
great
part
of
the
night
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
Strap
,
with
whom
I
have
not
converse
these
two
day
,
present
himself
with
the
utensil
for
shave
me
;
upon
which
,
I
ask
his
opinion
of
the
lady
whom
he
have
see
me
conduct
to
her
coach
at
Hampstead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Odd
!
<EOS>
she
be
a
delicious
creature
(
cry
he
)
and
,
as
I
be
inform
,
a
great
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
you
do
not
insist
on
go
home
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
she
would
not
have
refuse
your
company
;
for
she
seem
to
be
a
good
-
humoured
soul
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
time
for
all
thing
(
say
I.
)
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Strap
,
I
be
in
company
with
her
till
one
o'clock
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
pronounce
these
word
,
than
he
begin
to
caper
about
the
room
,
and
snap
his
finger
,
cry
in
a
transport
,
"
the
day
's
our
own
!
 
<EOS>
the
day
's
our
own
!
<EOS>
"
I
give
him
to
understand
that
his
triumph
be
a
little
premature
,
and
that
I
have
more
difficulty
to
surmount
than
he
be
aware
of
;
then
I
recount
to
him
the
intelligence
I
have
receive
from
Banter
.
 
<EOS>
at
which
he
change
colour
,
shake
his
head
,
and
observe
there
be
no
faith
in
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
be
resolve
to
make
a
bold
push
notwithstanding
,
although
I
foresaw
it
would
lead
me
into
a
great
expence
;
and
bid
him
guess
the
sum
I
have
lose
last
night
at
card
.
 
<EOS>
He
scratch
his
chin
,
and
profess
his
abhorrence
of
card
,
the
very
name
of
which
be
mention
make
him
sweat
with
vexation
,
as
it
recall
the
money
-
dropper
to
his
remembrance
;
"
but
however
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
have
to
do
with
other
guess
people
now
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
suppose
,
if
you
have
a
bad
run
last
night
,
you
would
scarce
come
off
for
less
than
ten
or
twelve
shilling
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
be
mortify
at
this
piece
of
simplicity
,
which
I
imagine
,
at
that
time
,
be
all
affect
by
way
of
reprimand
for
my
folly
;
and
ask
with
some
heat
,
if
he
think
I
have
spend
the
evening
in
a
cellar
with
chairman
and
bunter
;
give
him
to
know
,
at
the
same
time
time
,
that
my
expence
amount
to
eighteen
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
require
the
pencil
of
Hogarth
to
express
the
astonishment
and
concern
of
Strap
,
on
hear
this
piece
of
news
;
the
bason
in
which
he
be
prepare
the
lather
for
my
chin
,
drop
out
of
his
hand
,
and
he
remain
some
time
immoveable
in
that
ludicrous
attitude
,
with
his
mouth
open
,
and
his
eye
;
thrust
forward
considerably
beyond
their
station
;
but
remember
my
disposition
,
which
be
touchy
and
impatient
of
controul
,
he
smother
his
chagrin
,
and
attempt
to
recollect
himself
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
endeavour
to
laugh
,
but
in
spite
of
his
tooth
,
break
out
into
a
whimper
,
take
up
his
washball
and
pewter
-
pot
,
scrub
my
beard
with
the
one
,
and
discharge
the
other
upon
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
no
notice
of
his
confusion
,
but
after
he
have
fully
recover
himself
,
put
him
in
mind
of
his
right
,
and
assure
him
of
my
readiness
to
surrender
his
effect
whenever
he
should
think
proper
to
demand
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
nettle
at
my
insinuation
,
which
he
think
proceed
from
my
distrust
of
his
friendship
;
and
beg
I
would
never
talk
to
him
in
that
strain
again
,
unless
I
have
a
mind
to
break
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
this
good
creature
's
unalterable
friendship
for
me
affect
me
with
the
most
grateful
sentiment
,
and
act
as
a
spur
to
my
resolution
of
acquire
a
fortune
,
that
I
may
have
it
in
my
power
to
manifest
my
generosity
in
my
turn
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
I
determine
to
bring
matter
to
a
speedy
conclusion
with
Melinda
;
well
know
that
a
few
such
night
as
the
last
,
would
effectually
incapacitate
me
from
prosecute
that
,
or
any
other
advantageous
amour
.
    
<EOS>
while
my
meditation
be
busy
in
plan
out
my
future
conduct
,
Mr
Banter
favour
me
with
a
visit
;
and
after
breakfast
,
ask
how
I
have
pass
the
preceeding
evening
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
I
be
very
agreeably
entertain
at
a
private
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
(
say
he
,
with
a
sarcastic
smile
)
<EOS>
you
deserve
something
extraordinary
for
the
price
you
pay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
at
his
remark
,
and
pretend
ignorance
of
his
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
Random
(
continue
he
)
<EOS>
you
need
not
make
a
mystery
of
it
to
me
,
the
whole
town
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
that
foolish
affair
between
you
and
Bragwell
at
Hampstead
have
be
less
publick
 
<EOS>
It
have
set
all
the
busy
body
at
work
to
find
out
your
real
character
and
situation
;
and
you
can
not
imagine
what
conjecture
have
already
circulate
at
your
expence
:
one
suspect
you
to
be
Jesuit
in
disguise
;
another
believe
you
be
an
agent
from
the
Pretender
;
a
third
believe
you
to
be
an
upstart
gamester
,
because
no
body
know
any
thing
of
your
family
or
fortune
;
a
fourth
be
of
opinion
,
that
you
be
an
irish
fortune
-
hunter
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
last
hypothesis
touch
me
so
near
,
that
,
to
conceal
my
confusion
,
I
be
fain
to
interrupt
his
detail
,
and
damn
the
world
for
an
envious
meddling
community
,
that
would
not
suffer
a
gentleman
to
live
without
molestation
.
    
<EOS>
He
take
no
notice
of
this
apostrophe
,
but
go
on
,
"
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
neither
know
nor
desire
to
know
,
<EOS>
who
,
or
what
you
be
;
this
I
be
certain
of
,
that
few
people
make
a
mystery
of
their
origin
and
situation
,
who
can
boast
of
any
thing
advantageous
in
either
;
 
and
my
own
opinion
of
the
matter
be
,
that
you
have
raise
yourself
by
your
industry
,
from
nothing
to
the
appearance
you
now
maintain
,
and
which
you
endeavour
to
support
by
some
matrimonial
scheme
.

<EOS>
here
he
fix
his
eye
stedfastly
upon
me
,
and
perceive
my
face
cover
with
blush

tell
me

now
he
be
confirm
in
his
opinion

Random

(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
have
divine
your
plan

and
be
confident
it
will
never
succeed
 
You
be
too
honest
and
too
ignorant
of
the
town
,
to
practice
the
necessary
cheat
of
your
profession
,
and
detect
the
conspiracy
that
will
be

against

you
be
downright
bashful
 
<EOS>
what
the

<EOS>
set
up
for

before

conquer
the

perhaps
you
be
entitle
by
your
merit

and
I
believe
you
be
,
to
a
rich
and
well
wife
than
Melinda
;
but
take
my
word
for
it
<EOS>
,
she
be
not
to
be
win
at
that
rate

or
,
if
you
be
so
lucky
as
to
carry
her

you
may
say

as
Teague
do

by
my
soul

have
gain
a
lass

She
would
take
care
to
spend
her
own
fortune
in
a
twinkling
,
and
soon
make
you
sick
of
her
extravagance

I
be
alarm
by
his
discourse
,
while
I
resent
the
freedom
of
it
,
and
express
my
disgust
,
by
tell
him
,
he
be
mistaken
in
my
intention
,
and
desire
he
would
give
me
leave
to
regulate
my
conduct
accord
to
the
dictate
of
my
own
reason

<EOS>
He
make
an
apology
for
the
liberty
he
have
take
,
and
ascribe
it
to
the
warmth
of
his
friendship
for
me
;
as
an
uncommon
instance
of
which
,
he
borrow
five
guinea
,
assure
me
,
there
be
very
few
people
in
the
world
whom
he
would
so
far
favour
with
his
confidence

<EOS>
I
give
him
the
money
,
and
profess
myself
so
well
convinced
of
his
sincerity
,
that
he
have
no
occasion
to
put
it
to
such
extraordinary
proof
for
the
future

<EOS>
"
I
think
(
say
he
)
to
have
ask
five
piece
more
,
but
hear
you
be
bubble
of
eighteen
last
night
,
I
presume
you
may
be
out
of
cash
,
and
resolve
to
model
my
demand
accordingly

I
could
not
help
admire
the
cavalier
behaviour
of
this
spark
,
of
whom
I
desire
to
know
his
reason
for
say
I
be
bubble

<EOS>
Whereupon
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
before

come
to
my
lodging

he
have
beat
up
Tom
Tossle

who
have
be
present

inform
him
of
the
particular
,
rehearse
all
the
fine
thing
I
say
to
Melinda
,
with
which
he
propose
to
entertain
the
town
;
and
among
other
circumstance
,
assure
him
,
my
mistress
cheat
with
so
little
art
,
that
no
body

a
meer
novice
could
have
be
impose
upon

<EOS>
the
thought
of
become
a
subject
of
raillery
for
coxcomb
,
and
lose
my
money
to
boot
,
sting
me
to
the
quick

I
make
a
virtue

my
indignation

swear
that
no
man
should
with
impunity
,
either
asperse
the
character
of

turn
my
behaviour
into
ridicule

He
reply
in
a
dry
manner
,
that
I
would
find
it
a
herculean
task
to
chastise
every
body
who
should
laugh
at
my
expence
;
and
as
for
the
character
of
Melinda
,
he
do
not
see
how
it
could
suffer
by
what
be
lay
to
her
charge

that
cheat
at
card

so
far
from

look
upon
as

indication
of
superior
genius
and

let
us
wave
this
subject
(

chapter
XLVIII
<EOS>
We
repair
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
we
overhear
a
curious
dispute
between
Wagtail
and
Medlar
,
which
be
refer
to
our
decision
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
give
us
an
account
of
his
experiment
 
<EOS>
Medlar
be
roast
by
Banter
,
at
the
ordinary
 
the
old
gentleman
's
advice
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
be
as
willing
to
drop
the
theme
,
as
he
to
propose
it
,
I
accompany
him
thither
,
where
we
find
Mr
Medlar
and
doctor
Wagtail
,
dispute
upon
the
word
Custard
,
which
the
physician
affirm
should
be
spell
with
a
g
,
because
it
be
derive
from
the
latin
verb
gustare
,
"
to
taste
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
Medlar
plead
custom
in
behalf
of
C
,
observe
,
that
by
the
doctor
's
rule
,
we
ought
to
change
pudding
into
budding
,
because
it
be
derive
from
the
french
word
boudin
;
and
in
that
case
,
why
not
retain
the
original
orthography
and
pronounciation
of
all
the
foreign
word
we
have
adopt
;
by
which
mean
our
language
would
become
a
dissonant
jargon
without
standard
or
propriety
.
<EOS>
the
controversy
be
refer
to
us
;
and
Banter
,
notwithstanding
his
real
opinion
to
the
contrary
,
decide
it
in
favour
of
Wagtail
:
upon
which
,
the
peevish
annuitant
arise
,
and
utter
the
monosyllable
,
pish
!
<EOS>
with
great
emphasis
,
remove
to
another
table
.
    
<EOS>
We
then
enquire
of
the
doctor
,
what
progress
he
have
make
in
the
experiment
of
distil
tinderwater
;
and
he
tell
us
,
he
have
be
at
all
the
glass
-
house
about
town
,
but
could
find
no
body
who
would
undertake
to
blow
a
retort
large
enough
to
hold
the
third
part
of
the
quantity
prescribed
;
but
he
intend
to
try
the
process
on
as
much
as
would
produce
five
drop
,
which
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
the
specific
,
and
then
he
would
make
it
a
parliamentary
affair
;
 
that
he
have
already
purchase
a
considerable
weight
of
rag
,
in
the
reducing
of
which
to
tinder
,
he
have
meet
with
a
misfortune
which
have
oblige
him
to
change
his
lodging
:
for
he
have
gather
them
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
,
and
set
fire
to
them
with
a
candle
,
on
the
supposition
that
the
board
would
sustain
no
damage
,
because
it
be
the
nature
of
flame
to
ascend
;
but
by
some
very
extraordinary
accident
,
the
wood
be
invade
,
and
begin
to
blaze
with
great
violence
,
which
disorder
him
so
much
,
that
he
have
not
presence
of
mind
enough
to
call
for
assistance
,
and
the
whole
house
must
have
be
consume
with
him
in
the
midst
of
it
,
have
not
the
smoke
that
roll
out
of
the
window
in
cloud
alarm
the
neighbourhood
,
and
bring
people
to
his
succour
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
lose
a
pair
of
black
velvet
breech
and
a
tye
-
wig
in
the
hurry
,
besides
the
expence
of
the
rag
,
which
be
render
useless
by
the
water
use
to
quench
the
flame
,
and
the
damage
of
the
floor
,
which
he
be
compel
to
repair
.
     
<EOS>
that
his
landlord
believe
him
distract
,
have
insist
on
his
quit
his
apartment
at
a
minute
's
warning
,
which
put
him
to
incredible
inconvenience
;
but
now
he
be
settle
in
a
very
comfortable
house
,
and
have
the
use
of
a
large
paved
yard
for
prepare
his
tinder
:
so
that
he
hope
in
a
very
short
time
to
reap
the
fruit
of
his
labour
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
congratulate
the
doctor
on
his
prospect
,
and
read
the
paper
,
we
repair
to
an
auction
of
picture
,
where
we
entertain
ourselves
an
hour
or
two
;
from
thence
we
adjourn
to
the
Mall
,
and
after
two
or
three
turn
,
go
back
to
dinner
,
Banter
assure
us
,
that
he
intend
to
roast
Medlar
,
at
the
ordinary
;
and
indeed
,
we
be
no
sooner
set
than
this
Cynic
begin
to
execute
his
purpose
by
tell
the
old
gentleman
,
he
look
extremely
well
,
consider
the
little
sleep
he
have
enjoy
last
night
.
<EOS>
to
this
compliment
Medlar
make
no
reply
,
but
by
a
stare
,
accompany
with
a
significant
grin
;
 
and
Banter
go
on
thus
:
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
most
to
admire
the
charity
of
your
mind
,
or
the
vigour
of
your
body
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
Mr
Medlar
,
you
do
generous
thing
with
the
good
taste
of
any
man
I
know
!
<EOS>
You
extend
your
compassion
to
real
object
,
and
exact
only
such
return
as
they
be
capable
of
make
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
gentleman
,
(
say
he
,
turn
to
the
company
)
<EOS>
I
have
be
up
most
part
of
the
night
with
a
friend
who
be
bad
of
a
fever
,
and
on
my
return
home
this
morning
,
I
chance
to
pass
by
a
gin
-
shop
still
open
,
whence
issue
a
confused
sound
of
mirth
and
jollity
:
upon
which
I
pop
in
my
head
,
and
perceive
Mr
Medlar
dance
bare
-
head
in
the
midst
of
ten
or
twenty
ragged
Bunters
,
who
rejoice
at
his
expence
.
<EOS>
but
indeed
,
Mr
Medlar
,
you
ought
not
to
sacrifice
your
constitution
to
your
benevolence
.
     
<EOS>
consider
you
grow
old
apace
;
and
therefore
have
a
reverend
care
of
your
health
,
which
must
certainly
be
very
much
impair
by
these
nocturnal
expedition
.

"
 
<EOS>
the
testy
senior
could
no
longer
contain
himself
,
but
cry
hastily
,
"
'
Tis
well
know
that
your
tongue
be
no
slander

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
(
say
the
other
)
<EOS>
you
may
spare
that
observation
,
as
you
be
very
sensible
that
my
tongue
have
do
you
signal
service
on
many
occasion

<EOS>
You
may
remember
,
that
when
you
make
your
address
to
the
sat
widow
,
who
keep
a
publick

house
at
Islington
,
there
be
a
report
spread
very
much
to
the
prejudice
of
your
manhood
;
which
come
to
the
ear
of
your
mistress
,
you
be
discard
immediately
;
and
I
bring
matter
to
a
reconciliation
,
by
assure
her
you
have
three
bastard
at
nurse
in
the
country
:
<EOS>
how
you
ruin
your
own
affair
afterwards
,
it
be
neither
my
business
nor
inclination
to
relate

"
 
<EOS>
this
anecdote
,
which
have
no
other
foundation
than
in
Banter
's
own
invention
,
afford
a

which
I
be

no

I

<EOS>
by
this

the
violence
of
his
wrath
have
deprive
him
of

he
sit
silent

unable

Dinner

we
come
down

to

and
Banter
go
away
to
keep
an
appointment
,
say
,
he
suppose
he
should
see
Wagtail
and
me
in
the
evening
at
the
Bedford
coffee

house
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
go
,
than
the
old
gentleman
take
me
aside
,
and
say
,
he
be
sorry
to
see
me
so
intimate
with
that
fellow
who
be
one
of
the
most
graceless
<EOS>
rake
about
town
,
and
have
already
waste
a
good
estate
and
constitution
upon
harlot
;
 
that
he
have
be
the
ruin
of
many
a
young
man
,
by
introduce
them
into
debauch
company
,
and
set
a
lewd
example
of
all
manner
of
wickedness
;
and
that
,
unless
I
be
on
my
guard
,
he
would
strip
me
in
a
short
time
,
both
of
my
money
and
reputation
.
    
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
information
,
and
promise
to
conduct
myself
accordingly
,
wish
however
,
his
caution
have
be
a
few
hour
more
early
,
by
which
mean
I
may
have
save
five
guinea
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
intelligence
,
I
be
inclinable
to
impute
some
part
of
the
charge
to
Medlar
's
revenge
for
the
liberty
take
with
him
at
dinner
;
and
therefore
,
as
soon
as
I
could
disengage
myself
,
apply
to
Wagtail
for
his
opinion
of
the
character
in
question
;
resolve
to
compare
their
account
,
allow
for
the
prejudice
of
each
,
and
form
my
judgment
upon
both
,
without
adhere
strictly
to
either
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
assure
me
that
he
be
a
very
pretty
gentleman
,
of
family
and
fortune
;
a
scholar
,
a
wit
,
a
critick
,
and
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
town
;
that
his
honour
and
courage
be
unquestionable
,
though
some
extravagancy
he
have
be
guilty
of
,
and
his
talent
for
satire
,
have
procure
him
enemy
,
and
make
some
people
shy
of
his
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
from
these
different
sketch
,
I
conclude
that
Banter
be
a
young
fellow
of
some
part
,
who
have
spend
his
fortune
,
but
retain
his
appetite
,
and
fall
out
with
the
world
because
he
could
not
enjoy
it
to
his

<EOS>
I
go
to

from
thence
proceed
to

afterwards
carry
them

sup
with
great

bring

a

direct
to
Mr
Random

Esq

those

<EOS>
which
,
upon
opening
,
I
find
contain
a
challenge
,
couch
in
these
very
extraordinary
term
:
    
"
SIR
,
Whereas
,
I
be
inform
that
you
make
love
to
Miss
Melinda
Goosetrap
,
this
be
to
let
you
know
,
that
she
be
under
promise
of
marriage
to
me
;
and
that
I
be
at
this
present
writing
,
at
the
back
of
Montague
-
house
,
with
a
pair
of
good
pistol
in
my
hand
,
and
if
you
will
keep
your
appointment
,
I
will
make
your
tongue
confess
<EOS>
(
after
the
breath
be
out
of
your
body
)
that
you
do
not
deserve
her
as
well
as
"
Yours
,
&
c.
Rourk
Oregan
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
guess
from
the
stile
and
subscription
of
this
billet
,
that
my
rival
be
a
true
Milesian
,
and
be
not
a
little
uneasy
at
the
content
,
especially
that
part
,
where
he
assert
his
right
to
my
mistress
by
promise
,
a
circumstance
I
do
not
know
how
to
reconcile
to
her
penetration
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
no
time
for
me
to
decline
the
invitation
,
because
the
success
of
my
address
may
in
a
great
measure
depend
upon
my
behaviour
in
that
affair
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
immediately
load
my
pistol
,
and
betook
myself
in
a
hackney
-
coach
to
the
place
appoint
,
where
I
find
a
tall
raw
-
boned
man
,
with
a
hard
feature
countenance
,
and
black
bushy
beard
,
walk
by
himself
,
wrap
up
in
a
shabby
great
coat
,
over
which
his
own
hair
descend
in
a
leathern
queue
from
his
head
,
that
be
cover
with
a
greasy
hat
trim
with
a
tarnished
pointe
d'espagne
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
perceive
me
advance
,
than
without
any
preamble
,
he
pull
a
pistol
from
his
bosom
,
and
present
at
me
,
snapt
it
.
<EOS>
alarm
at
this
rude
salutation
,
I
make
a
stand
,
and
before
he
could
adjust
his
other
piece
,
fire
one
of
mine
at
him
,
without
do
any
damage
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
he
be
ready
with
his
second
,
that
flash
in
the
pan
without
go
off
:
upon
which
he
call
,
with
a
true
tipperary
cadence
,
"
fire
away
,
honey
,
"
 
and
begin
to
hammer
his
flint
with
great
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
resolve
to
make
use
of
the
advantage
Fortune
have
give
me
;
and
therefore
stept
up
,
without
throw
away
my
fire
,
desire
him
to
ask
his
life
,
or
prepare
for
another
world
;
 
but
this
stout
Hibernian
refuse
to
condescend
,
and
complain
bitterly
of
my
have
quit
my
ground
before
he
could
return
my
shot
;
say
I
ought
to
go
back
to
my
station
,
and
let
him
have
an
equal
chance
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
persuade
him
that
I
have
give
him
a
double
chance
already
;
and
it
be
my
business
to
prevent
him
from
enjoy
a
third
;
 
but
now
,
since
I
have
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
I
demand
a
parley
,
and
desire
to
know
his
condition
,
and
reason
for
call
me
to
the
field
,
who
,
to
the
good
of
my
remembrance
,
so
far
from
have
do
him
any
injury
,
have
never
before
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
he
be
a
gentleman
of
fortune
,
who
have
spend
all
he
have
,
and
hear
that
Melinda
have
get
ten
thousand
pound
,
he
intend
to
make
himself
master
of
that
sum
by
espouse
her
,
and
be
determine
,
in
an
honourable
way
,
to
cut
the
throat
of
all
those
who
stand
between
him
and
his
hope
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
demand
to
know
the
foundation
of
his
hope
;
and
now
that
I
have
see
him
,
be
more
and
more
astonished
at
the
circumstance
of
the
promise
,
desire
he
would
explain
that
mystery
:
     
<EOS>
He
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
trust
entirely
to
his
birth
and
personal
merit
;
that
he
have
frequently
write
to
Melinda
,
set
forth
his
claim
and
pretension
,
but
she
be
never
kind
enough
to
send
an
answer
,
or
even
to
admit
him
into
her
presence
;
and
that
the
promise
he
mention
in
his
letter
,
be
make
by
his
friend
Mr
Gaghagan
,
who
assure
him
,
that
no
woman
could
resist
a
man
of
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
laugh
to
excess
,
at
the
simplicity
of
my
rival
,
who
do
not
seem
to
relish
my
mirth
;
but
begin
to
be
very
serious
:
<EOS>
upon
which
I
endeavour
to
appease
him
,
by
give
him
my
word
and
honour
,
that
so
far
from
prejudice
his
address
to
the
lady
,
I
would
represent
him
to
her
in
the
most
favourable
light
I
could
,
with
any
regard
to
truth
;
but
he
must
not
be
surprize
if
she
should
remain
blind
to
his
desert
,
for
nothing
be
more
capricious
than
a
woman
's
mind
,
and
the
affection
of
that
sex
be
seldom
purchase
with
virtue
alone
.
 
<EOS>
that
my
declaration
may
have
the
well
effect
,
I
take
notice
of
his
dishabille
,
and
profess
sorrow
at
see
a
gentleman
reduce
,
slipt
two
guinea
into
his
hand
,
at
the
sight
of
which
,
he
throw
away
his
pistol
,
and
hug
me
in
his
arm
,
cry
,
"
Arrah
,
by
Jesus
,
now
,
you
be
the
good
friend
I
have
meet
with
these
seven
long
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
suffer
some
minute
in
his
embrace
,
he
quit
me
,
and
pick
up
his
rusty
arm
,
wish
the
devil
may
burn
him
if
ever
he
should
give
me
any
further
trouble
about
woman
-
kind
.
    
<EOS>
the
quarrel
be
thus
amicably
compose
,
I
beg
leave
to
look
at
his
pistol
,
which
I
find
so
crazy
and
so
foul
,
that
,
I
believe
,
it
be
happy
for
him
neither
of
them
be
discharge
,
for
one
of
them
would
certainly
have
split
in
the
go
off
,
and
he
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
lose
his
hand
in
the
explosion
;
but
what
give
me
a
lively
idea
of
the
man
's
character
,
be
to
find
,
upon
examination
,
that
one
of
them
have
be
load
without
be
prime
,
and
the
other
prime
without
a
charge
.
    
<EOS>
while
we
walk
homeward
together
,
I
express
a
desire
of
know
my
new
friend
's
history
:
and
he
inform
me
of
his
have
serve
in
the
german
army
as
a
volunteer
against
the
Turks
;
that
for
his
behaviour
at
the
siege
of
Belgrade
,
he
have
be
honour
with
an
ensign
's
commission
,
and
afterwards
promote
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
,
in
which
station
,
it
be
his
misfortune
to
affront
his
captain
,
who
challenge
him
to
the
field
,
and
be
kill
in
the
duel
,
upon
which
he
be
oblige
to
retreat
;
 
that
he
have
be
in
England
some
year
sollicite
his
friend
for
provision
in
the
british
army
;
but
be
hitherto
unsuccessful
,
he
be
desire
by
Mr
Gaghagan
to
turn
his
thought
to
matrimony
,
and
make
his
fortune
by
an
advantageous
match
;
in
consequence
of
which
advice
,
he
have
make
up
to
Melinda
,
and
have
hear
,
by
mean
of
an
irish
footman
in
the
family
,
that
I
be
her
chief
favourite
,
have
call
me
out
in
hope
of
remove
by
my
death
,
the
great
obstruction
to
his
desire
;
but
now
he
be
convince
of
my
honour
and
generosity
,
he
swear
by
the
bless
Virgin
,
he
would
think
of
her
no
more
,
if
there
be
not
another
woman
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
further
proof
of
his
veracity
,
which
I
do
not
at
all
doubt
,
he
open
an
old
iron
snuff
-
box
,
and
pull
out
his
commission
in
the
imperial
army
,
and
his
captain
's
challenge
,
which
he
preserve
as
testimonial
of
his
character
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
well
convinced
of
this
poor
man
's
honesty
and
courage
,
that
I
determine
to
speak
in
his
behalf
to
some
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
may
recommend
his
case
to
the
consideration
of
those
who
could
provide
for
him
;
and
in
the
mean
time
to
accommodate
him
with
a
few
cloath
,
by
which
his
appearance
would
be
much
mend
,
and
himself
enable
to
renew
his
solicitation
in
person
.
    
<EOS>
as
we
walk
along
,
converse
socially
together
,
we
be
meet
by
a
file
of
musqueteer
,
and
Strap
at
their
head
,
who
no
sooner
approach
,
than
with
a
frantick
look
,
he
cry
,
"
seize
them
!
 
<EOS>
in
the
name
of
God
!
<EOS>
seize
them
"
 
<EOS>
We
be
accordingly
surround
,
and
I
put
in
arrest
by
the
corporal
,
who
be
command
officer
;
but
captain
Oregan
disengage
himself
,
and
run
with
such
speed
towards
Tottenham
-
court
-
road
,
that
he
be
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
when
my
arm
be
deliver
up
,
and
myself
secure
,
Strap
become
a
little
more
composed
,
and
ask
pardon
for
the
liberty
he
have
take
,
which
he
hope
I
would
excuse
,
as
it
proceed
from
his
affection
:
He
then
tell
me
that
,
suspect
the
letter
(
which
by
the
bye
be
bring
by
the
author
himself
)
contain
something
extraordinary
,
he
have
peep
through
the
key
-
hole
,
and
see
me
load
my
pistol
;
upon
which
he
run
down
to
Whitehall
,
and
apply
to
the
officer
on
guard
,
for
a
party
to
put
me
in
arrest
,
but
before
he
return
,
I
be
go
in
a
coach
;
that
he
have
enquire
which
way
I
go
,
and
have
often
hear
,
that

be
commonly
seek
at
the

where

God
for

safe
and
sound
.
    
<EOS>
I
let
him
know
,
that
I
forgave
his
officious
concern
for
once
,
but
caution
him
in
pretty
severe
term
,
from
make
me
the
subject
of
idle
conversation
for
the
future
;
then
,
turn
to
the
corporal
,
I
thank
him
for
his
care
,
and
give
hime
a
crown
to
drink
with
his
man
,
assure
him
that
the
rencontre
be
over
long
before
he
come
up
,
and
every
thing
compromise
,
as
he
may
have
observe
by
our
behaviour
;
as
a
farth
proof
of
which
,
he
would
find
upon
examination
,
that
one
of
my
pistol
have
be
discharge
;
 
but
this
civil
person
,
without
give
himself
or
me
any
further
trouble
,
receive
the
bounty
with
a
thousand
bow
and
acknowledgment
,
and
return
the
pistol
,
release
me
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
not
go
an
hundred
yard
,
when
my
friend
Oregan
come
up
,
in
order
to
rescue
me
,
with
two
tatterdemalion
whom
he
have
engage
for
that
purpose
,
about
the
purlieu
of
St
Giles
's
:
one
of
them
be
arm
with
a
musket
that
want
a
lock
,
and
another
with
a
rusty
broadsword
;
but
their
dress
surpass
all
description
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
understand
I
be
already
free
,
he
make
an
apology
for
his
abrupt
departure
,
and
introduce
me
to
his
two
companion
:
first
,
to
counsellor
Fitz
-
clabber
,
who
,
he
tell
me
,
be
then
employ
in
compile
a
history
of
the
king
of
Munster
,
from
irish
manuscript
;
and
then
to
his
friend
Mr
Gaghagan
,
who
be
a
profound
philosopher
and
politician
,
and
have
project
many
excellent
scheme
for
the
good
of
his
country
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
these
literati
have
be
very
ill
reward
for
their
ingenious
labour
;
for
between
them
both
,
there
be
but
one
shirt
and
half
a
pair
of
breech
.
     
<EOS>
I
thank
them
very
kindly
for
their
readiness
to
assist
me
,
and
have
offer
my
service
in
my
turn
,
wish
them
a
good
-
morrow
,
desire
Oregan
to
accompany
me
to
my
lodging
,
where
he
be
fit
with
decent
cloath
from
my
wardrobe
,
so
much
to
his
satisfaction
,
that
he
swear
eternal
gratitude
and
friendship
to
me
,
and
at
my
request
,
recount
all
the
adventure
of
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
I
wait
on
Melinda
,
who
receive
me
with
great
kindness
and
familiarity
,
and
laugh
excessively
at
my
adventure
with
the
Irishman
,
to
whose
wish
<EOS>
she
be
no
stranger
,
have
more
than
a
dozen
letter
in
her
possession
,
which
he
have
write
to
her
on
the
subject
of
love
,
and
which
,
for
my
entertainment
,
she
submit
to
my
perusal
.
 
<EOS>
have
make
ourselves
merry
at
the
expence
of
this
poor
admirer
,
I
seize
the
opportunity
of
her
mother
be
go
out
of
the
room
,
and
introduce
my
own
passion
,
which
I
recommend
to
her
with
all
the
ardour
and
eloquence
I
be
master
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
flatter
,
sigh
,
swear
,
intreate
,
and
act
a
thousand
extravagancy
,
in
hope
of
make
some
impression
on
her
heart
;
but
she
hear
every
thing
I
say
without
discover
the
least
emotion
;
and
other
company
come
in
,
before
she
would
vouchsafe
one
serious
reply
.
 
<EOS>
after
tea
,
the
card
be
bring
in
accord
to
custom
,
and
it
be
my
good
fortune
to
have
Melinda
for
my
partner
;
by
which
mean
,
instead
of
lose
,
I
come
off
with
five
guinea
clear
gain
.
    
<EOS>
I
soon
become
acquaint
with
a
good
many
people
of
fashion
,
and
spend
my
time
in
the
modish
diversion
of
the
town
,
such
as
play
,
opera
,
masquerade
,
drum
,
assembly
and
puppet
-
shew
;
chiefly
in
company
with
Melinda
,
whom
I
cultivate
with
all
the
eagerness
and
address
that
my
prospect
could
inspire
,
and
my
education
afford
:
    
<EOS>
I
spare
neither
my
person
nor
my
purse
,
to
gratify
her
vanity
and
pride
;
my
rival
be
intimidate
,
and
indeed
out
-
shone
;
and
after
all
,
I
begin
to
fear
that
the
dear
creature
have
not
a
heart
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
find
myself
unable
to
support
the
expence
of
this
amour
much
longer
,
I
be
determined
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
crisis
;
and
one
evening
,
while
we
be
tete
a
tÍte
,
complain
of
her
indifference
,
describe
the
torture
of
suspence
to
a
love
-
sick
mind
,
and
press
her
to
disclose
her
sentiment
of
matrimony
and
me
,
with
such
earnestness
,
that
she
could
not
with
all
her
art
,
shift
the
subject
;
but
be
oblige
to
come
to
an
eclaircissement
.
 
<EOS>
She
let
me
know
with
a
careless
air
,
that
she
have
no
objection
to
my
person
,
and
if
I
could
satisfy
her
mother
in
other
particular
,
I
should
not
find
her
averse
to
the
match
;
but
she
be
resolve
to
do
nothing
in
an
affair
of
such
moment'ous
concern
,
without
the
advice
and
consent
of
her
parent
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
a
very
agreeable
declaration
to
me
,
whose
aim
have
be
to
win
her
inclination
first
,
and
then
secure
my
conquest
by
a
private
marriage
,
to
which
I
flatter
myself
she
would
express
no
reluctance
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
may
not
,
however
,
desert
my
cause
<EOS>
before
it
be
desperate
,
I
wait
on
the
mother
,
and
with
great
formality
demand
the
daughter
in
marriage
:
the
good
lady
,
who
be
a
very
notable
woman
,
behave
with
great
state
and
civility
;
thank
me
for
the
honour
I
intend
her
family
,
and
say
,
she
do
not
doubt
that
I
be
in
all
respect
qualified
to
make
a
woman
happy
;
but
it
concern
her
as
a
parent
anxious
about
the
welfare
of
her
child
,
to
enquire
into
the
particular
of
my
fortune
,
and
know
what
settlement
I
propose
to
make
.
    
<EOS>
to
this
intimation
,
which
would
have
utterly
disconcert
me
,
if
I
have
not
expect
it
,
I
reply
without
hesitation
,
that
though
my
fortune
be
very
small
,
I
be
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
education
,
would
maintain
her
daughter
in
the
sphere
of
a
gentlewoman
,
and
settle
her
own
dowry
on
her
and
her
heir
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
this
careful
matron
do
not
seem
to
relish
my
proposal
,
but
observe
with
a
demure
countenance
,
that
there
be
no
necessity
for
settle
that
upon
her
child
which
be
her
own
already
:
however
,
if
I
please
,
her
lawyer
should
confer
with
mine
upon
the
matter
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
she
desire
I
would
favour
her
with
the
perusal
of
my
rent
-
roll
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
vexation
I
be
under
,
I
could
scarce
forbear
laughing
in
her
face
,
at
the
mention
of
my
rent
-
roll
,
which
be
,
indeed
,
a
severe
piece
of
satire
upon
my
pretension
.
<EOS>
I
frankly
own
I
have
no
landed
estate
:
and
tell
her
,
that
I
could
not
exactly
specify
the
sum
I
be
master
of
,
until
I
have
regulate
my
affair
,
which
be
at
present
in
some
disorder
;
but
that
I
would
take
an
opportunity
of
satisfy
her
on
that
head
very
soon
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
I
take
my
leave
,
and
return
to
my
lodging
in
a
very
melancholy
mood
,
persuade
that
I
have
nothing
more
to
expect
from
that
quarter
:
<EOS>
I
be
confirm
in
this
opinion
next
day
,
when
I
go
back
with
a
view
of
explain
myself
more
fully
to
the
old
gentlewoman
;
and
be
tell
by
the
footman
,
that
his
lady
be
not
at
home
,
although
I
have
see
Melinda
through
the
blind
of
a
parlour
window
,
as
I
go
up
to
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
Incensed
at
this
affront
I
quit
the
door
,
without
say
one
word
,
and
as
I
repasse
the
parlour
,
bow
to
Miss
,
who
still
remain
in
the
same
situation
,
securely
screen
,
as
she
think
,
from
my
view
.
    
<EOS>
this
disappointment
give
me
more
uneasiness
on
Strap
's
account
,
than
my
own
;
for
I
be
in
no
danger
of
die
for
love
of
Melinda
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
remembrance
of
my
charming
Narcissa
,
be
a
continual
check
upon
my
conscience
,
during
the
whole
course
of
my
address
;
and
perhaps
contribute
to
the
bad
success
of
my
scheme
,
by
controule
my
rapture
,
and
condemn
my
design
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
a
necessity
for
acquaint
my
companion
with
every
thing
that
happen
to
me
,
and
I
perform
this
piece
of
duty
in
an
affected
passion
,
swear
I
would
be
his
pack
-
horse
no
longer
,
and
desire
him
to
take
the
management
of
his
affair
into
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
this
finesse
have
the
desire
effect
,
for
instead
of
grumble
over
my
miscarriage
,
Strap
be
frighten
at
the
passion
I
feign
,
and
beg
me
for
the
love
of
God
to
be
appease
;
observe
,
that
although
we
have
suffer
a
great
loss
,
it
be
not
irreparable
;
and
if
fortune
frown
to
day
,
she
may
perhaps
smile
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
pretend
to
acquiesce
in
his
remark
,
praise
his
equanimity
,
and
promise
to
improve
by
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
on
the
other
hand
,
pretend
to
be
perfectly
well
satisfied
with
my
conduct
,
and
conjure
me
to
follow
the
dictate
of
my
own
reflection
;
but
in
spite
of
all
his
affectation
,
I
could
perceive
his
inward
affliction
,
and
his
visage
sensibly
increase
in
longitude
from
that
day

in

of
another
mistress

the
desire

be
revenge
on

in
both
which
scheme
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
assist
by
Billy
Chatter
,
who
be
such
a
necessary
creature
among
the
lady
,
that
in
all
private
dance
he

the
man
.
     
<EOS>
to
him
therefore
I
apply
,
desire
he
would
introduce
me
to
a
partner
of
some
figure
,
at
the
next
private
assembly
,
for
the
sake
of
a
frolick
,
<EOS>
the
intention
of
which
I

afterwards
communicate
Billy
,
who
have
hear
something
of
a
difference
between
Melinda
and
me

smoake
part

I

,

gratify
my

by

me
with

whom
the
lady
of
this
end
of
the
town
,
have
lately
take
into
their
management
and
protection
.
 
<EOS>
upon
further
inquiry
,
I
find
this
person
's
name
be
Miss
Biddy
Gripewell
;
that
her
father
,
who
have
be
a
pawnbroker
,
die
intestate
,
by
which
mean
all
his
substance
descend
to
this
daughter
,
who
be
so
little
a
favourite
,
that
could
the
old
man
have
prevail
with
his
own
rapacious
disposition
,
to
part
with
as
much
money
as
would
have
pay
the
expence
of
a
will
,
she
would
not
have
inherit
the
sixth
part
of
his
fortune
;
 
that
during
his
life
,
so
far
from
be
educate
in
a
way
suitable
to
such
great
expectation
,
she
be
oblige
to
live
like
a
servant
wench
,
and
do
the
most
menial
office
in
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
funeral
be
no
sooner
perform
,
than
she
assume
the
fine
lady
,
and
find
so
many
people
of
both
sex
,
to
flatter
,
caress
and
instruct
her
,
that
,
for
want
of
discretion
and
experience
,
she
be
grow
insufferably
vain
and
arrogant
,
and
pretend
to
no
less
than
a
duke
or
earl
at
least
,
for
her
husband
;
 
that
she
have
the
misfortune
to
be
neglect
by
the
english
quality
,
but
a
certain
poor
Scottish
Lord
be
then
make
interest
to
be
introduce
to
her
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
she
be
fall
into
the
hand
of
a
notable
lady
,
who
have
already
dispose
of
her
to
a
lieutenant
of
foot
,
a
distant
relation
of
her
ladyship
's
,
though
Miss
,
as
yet
,
know
nothing
of
the
affair
;
and
lastly
,
that
if
I
propose
to
dance
with
her
,
I
must
give
him
leave
to
represent
me
as
a
knight
or
foreign
count
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ravish
at
this
piece
of
information
,
and
content
,
for
one
night
,
to
personate
a
French
Marquis
,
that
I
may
the
easy
fulfil
my
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
have
make
the
appointment
with
Chatter

I
go
to
Banter
's
lodging

have
by
this
time
conceive
a
great
opinion
of
his
penetration
and
knowledge
;
and
after
I
have
injoine
secrecy
,
tell
him
every
circumstance
of
my
disgrace
with
Melinda
,
and
impart
the
plan
I
have
project
to
mortify
that
proud
coquette
,
desire
his
advice
in
improve
,
and
assistance
in
execute
the
scheme
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
his
misanthropical
temper
,
than
an
account
of
her
behaviour
and
my
resentment
:
He
applaud
my
resolution
,
and
propose
that
I
should
not
only
provide
myself
in
a
proper
partner
,
but
also
procure
such
an
one
for
Miss
Goosetrap
,
as
would
infallibly
intail
upon
her
the
ridicule
of
all
her
acquaintance
:
for
this
purpose
he
mention
his
barber
,
who
,
he
say
,
be
an
exceed
coxcomb
,
lately
come
from
Paris
,
whose
absurd
affectation
and
grimace
would
easily
pass
upon
her
,
for
the
sprightly
politesse
of
a
gentleman
improve
by
travel
.
 
<EOS>
I
hug
him
for
this
hint
;
and
he
assure
me
,
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
make
him
believe
,
that
Melinda
have
see
him
by
accident
,
be
captivate
by
his
appearance
,
and
long
for
his
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
He
actually
engage
him
on
this
pretence
,
and
paint
his
good
fortune
in
such
colour
,
that
the
poor
shaver
be
quite
beside
himself
with
joy
,
 
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
fit
with
a
tawdry
suit
of
cloath
belong
to
Banter

and
by
him
recommend
to

as

very
pretty
fellow

the
fair
sex
in
and
about
town
undertake
,
at
once
,
to
bespeak
Melinda
in
his
behalf
;
and
every
thing
happen
accord
to
my
with
.
    
<EOS>
at
the
time
appoint
,
I
appear
,
dress
to
the
good
advantage
;
and
in
the
character
of
Marquis
,
have
the
honour
of
open
the
ball
with
the
rich
heiress
,
who
attract
the
eye
of
the
whole
company
,
by
the
prodigious
number
of
jewel
with
which
she
be
adorn
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
,
I
perceive
Melinda
,
who
could
no
more
conceal
her
envy
than
astonishment
at
my
success
:
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
be
still
more
flagrant
and
torment
,
for
she
have
never
see
Miss
Gripewell
before
;
and
Chatter
,
who
alone
could
give
her
any
satisfaction
on
that
head
,
be
engage
in
conversation
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
her
impatience
,
and
exult
in
her
chagrin
;
and
after
my
partner
be
set
,
take
the
opportunity
of
pass
by
her
to
make
a
slight
bow
without
stop
;
which
compleate
my
triumph
and
her
indignation
.
<EOS>
She
change
colour
,
bridle
up
,
assume
an
air
of
disdain
,
and
flirt
her
fan
with
such
fury
,
that
it
go
to
piece
in
a
moment
,
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
those
who
sit
near
and
observe
her
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
the
metamorphose
barber
take
her
out
,
and
act
his
part
with
such
ridiculous
extravagance
,
that
the
mirth
of
the
whole
company
be
excited
at
his
expence
,
and
his
partner
so
much
ashamed
,
that
before
the
country
dance
begin
,
she
retire
in
great
confusion
,
under
pretence
of
be
take
suddenly
ill
,
and
be
follow
by
her
gallant
,
who
no
doubt
,
<EOS>
imagine
her
indisposition
be
nothing
but
love
;
and
lay
hold
of
the
occasion
of
conduct
her
home
,
to
comfort
her
,
with
an
assurance
of
his
entertain
a
reciprocal
passion
.
     
<EOS>
They
be
no
sooner
go
,
than
an
inquisitive
whisper
of
"
who
be
he
?
<EOS>
"
run
round
the
room
;
and
Chatter
could
give
them
no
other
intelligence
about
him
,
than
that
he
be
a
man
of
fortune
,
just
return
from
his
travel
:
I
,
who
alone
be
acquaint
with
his
real
quality
,
affected
ignorance
,
well
know
that
female
curiosity
would
not
rest
satisfied
with
such
a
general
account
,
and
that
the
discovery
would
proceed
with
a
well
grace
from
any
body
than
me
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
be
tempt
by
the
richness
of
the
prize
,
to
practise
upon
Miss
Gripewell
's
heart
,
but
soon
find
it
too
well
fortified
with
pride
and
indifference
to
yield
to
any
effort
in
my
own
character
,
and
I
neither
would
nor
could
preserve
the
title
I
have
borrow
,
long
than
this
night
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
expect
,
every
thing
come
to
light
next
day
:
<EOS>
the
barber
,
in
pure
simplicity
of
heart
,
detect
himself
to
Melinda
,
and
discover
the
foundation
of
his
hope
;
she
sicken
at
the
affront
,
and
be
ashamed
to
shew
her
face
in
publick
for
many
week
after
this
accident
.
<EOS>
Poor
Chatter
find
it
impossible
to
justify
himself
to
her
satisfaction
;
be
in
utter
disgrace
with
Miss
Gripewell
,
for
have
impose
me
upon
her
as
a
nobleman
;
and
suffer
very
much
in
his
character
and
influence
among
the
lady
in
general
.
    
<EOS>
find
my
finance
diminish
more
than
one
half
,
and
my
project
as
little
advanced
:
as
on
the
first
day
of
my
arrival
in
town
,
I
begin
to
despair
of
my
success
,
and
grow
melancholy
at
the
prospect
of
approach
want
.
 
<EOS>
to
dispel
the
horror
of
this
fiend
,
I
have
recourse
to
the
bottle
,
and
keep
more
company
than
ever
.
     
<EOS>
I
become
particularly
attach
to
the
play
-
house
,
converse
with
the
actor
behind
the
scene
,
get
acquaint
with
a
body
of
templar
,
and
in
a
short
time
commence
a
professed
wit
and
critick
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
may
say
without
vanity
,
that
I
be
much
better
qualified
than
any
one
of
my
companion
,
who
be
,
generally
speak
,
of
all
the
creature
I
ever
converse
with
,
the
most
ignorant
and
assume
.
 
<EOS>
by
mean
of
these
avocation
I
get
the
well
of
care
,
and
learn
to
separate
my
idea
in
such
a
manner
,
that
whenever
I
be
attack
by
a
gloomy
reflection
,
I
could
shove
it
aside
,
and
call
in
some
agreeable
reverie
to
my
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
case
with
Strap
,
who
practise
a
thousand
shift
to
conceal
the
sorrow
that
prey
upon
his
carcass
,
and
reduce
him
to
the
resemblance
of
a
meer
skeleton
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
thus
post
,
in
a
thoughtless
manner
,
towards
poverty
,
I
one
day
receive
,
by
the
penny
-
post
,
a
letter
write
in
a
woman
's
hand
,
contain
a
great
many
high
-
fly
compliment
,
warm
protestation
of
love
,
couch
in
a
very
poetical
stile
,
an
earnest
desire
of
know
whether
or
not
my
heart
be
engage
,
by
leave
an
answer
at
a
certain
place
direct
to
R
B
and
the
whole
subscribed
,
"
Your
incognita
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
transport
with
joy
on
read
the
content
of
this
billet
doux
,
which
I
admire
as
a
master
-
piece
of
tenderness
and
elegance
,
and
be
already
up
to
the
ear
in
love
with
the
author
,
whom
my
imagination
represent
as
a
lady
of
fortune
,
in
the
bloom
of
youth
and
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
elevate
with
this
conjecture
,
I
go
to
work
and
exhaust
my
invention
in
compose
an
answer
suitable
to
the
sublimity
of
her
stile
,
and
the
ardour
of
her
sentiment
.
     
<EOS>
I
express
my
admiration
of
her
wit
,
in
term
the
most
hyperbolical
,
and
while
I
acknowledge
myself
unworthy
of
her
regard
,
declare
myself
enamour
of
her
understanding
;
and
in
the
most
pathetick
manner
,
implore
the
honour
of
an
interview
.
 
<EOS>
have
finish
this
performance
,
and
communicate
it
to
Strap
,
who
skip
about
for
joy
,
I
dispatch
him
with
it
to
the
place
appoint
,
which
be
the
house
of
a
milliner
not
far
from
bond
-
street
,
and
desire
him
to
keep
watch
near
the
door
for
some
time
,
that
he
may
discover
the
person
who
would
call
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
less
than
an
hour
he
return
,
with
a
joyful
countenance
,
and
tell
me
,
that
soon
after
he
have
deliver
the
letter
a
chairman
be
call
,
to
whom
it
be
give
,
with
direction
to
carry
it
to
the
house
of
a
rich
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
whither
he
(
Strap
)
follow
him
,
and
see
it
put
into
the
hand
of
a
waiting
-
woman
,
who
pay
the
messenger
and
shut
the
door
;
 
<EOS>
that
upon
inquiry
at
an
ale
-
house
hard
by
,
where
he
call
for
a
pint
of
beer
,
he
understand
,
that
the
gentleman
to
whom
the
house
belong
have
an
only
daughter
,
very
handsome
,
who
would
inherit
his
whole
estate
;
and
who
certainly
be
the
author
of
the
billet
I
have
receive
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
and
hug
myself
in
the
happy
prospect
,
dress
immediately
,
and
pass
in
great
state
by
the
house
that
contain
my
unknown
admirer
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
my
vanity
disappoint
;
for
I
perceive
a
beautiful
young
creature
stand
at
one
of
the
window
of
the
dining
-
room
,
who
,
I
imagine
,
observe
me
with
more
than
common
curiosity
.
<EOS>
that
I
may
indulge
her
view
,
and
at
the
same
time
feast
my
own
,
I
affect
to
stop
,
and
give
order
to
Strap
;
in
the
street
,
just
opposite
to
her
station
,
by
which
mean
I
have
an
opportunity
of
see
her
more
distinctly
,
and
of
congratulate
myself
on
have
make
a
conquest
of
so
much
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
she
retire
,
and
I
betook
myself
to
the
ordinary
,
in
a
rapture
of
hope
,
which
deprive
me
of
my
appetite
for
that
meal
,
and
send
me
home
in
the
evening
to
indulge
my
contemplation
.
    
<EOS>
early
next
day
,
I
be
favour
with
another
epistle
from
my
unknown
charmer
,
signify
her
unutterable
joy
at
the
receipt
of
mine
,
which
,
while
it
make
a
tender
of
my
heart
,
convince
her
of
the
value
of
it
.
<EOS>
above
all
thing
,
she
profess
extreme
pleasure
in
find
me
so
much
attach
to
her
understanding
,
a
circumstance
that
not
only
flatter
her
in
the
most
sensible
part
,
but
at
the
same
time
argue
my
own
sagacity
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
interview
I
desire
,
she
assure
me
,
that
I
could
not
be
more
eager
for
such
an
occasion
than
she
;
but
she
must
not
only
sacrifice
a
little
more
to
decorum
,
but
be
satisfied
of
my
honourable
intention
,
before
she
would
grant
that
request
:
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
she
give
me
to
understand
,
that
although
she
may
owe
some
deference
to
the
opinion
of
certain
person
,
she
be
resolve
,
in
an
affair
that
so
nearly
concern
her
happiness
,
to
consult
her
own
inclination
,
preferably
to
the
advice
of
the
whole
world
;
especially
,
as
she
be
urge
to
such
condescension
by
no
consideration
of
fortune
,
what
she
depend
upon
,
be
her
own
without
restriction
or
controul
.
     
<EOS>
Struck
with
admiration
at
the
philosophy
and
self
-
denial
of
my
mistress
,
who
seem
insensible
of
the
beauty
she
possess
;
and
in
particular
,
ravish
with
that
piece
of
intelligence
,
by
which
I
learn
her
fortune
be
independent
,
I
resume
the
pen
,
launch
out
into
encomium
on
the
dignity
of
her
sentiment
,
affect
to
under
-
value
the
charm
of
external
beauty
,
pretend
to
ground
my
passion
on
the
quality
of
her
mind
;
complain
of
her
rigour
,
in
sacrifice
my
repose
to
an
overscrupulous
regard
to
decorum
,
and
declare
the
purity
of
my
design
in
the
most
solemn
and
pathetic
vow
.
 
<EOS>
this
performance
be
seal
and
direct
,
be
send
to
the
place
appoint
,
by
Strap
,
who
,
that
we
may
be
still
the
more
confirmed
in
our
belief
,
renew
his
watch
,
and
in
a
little
time
bring
back
the
same
information
as
before
,
with
this
addition
,
that
Miss
Sparkle
,
(
the
name
of
my
suppose
correspondent
)
look
out
at
the
window
<EOS>
,
no
sooner
see
the
messenger
arrive
,
than
she
shut
the
casement
in
a
sort
of
beautiful
confusion
,
and
disappear
;
eager
,
no
doubt
,
to
hear
from
the
dear
object
of
her
love
.
    
<EOS>
My
doubt
now
vanish
,
the
long
expect
port
appear
,
and
I
look
upon
myself
as
perfectly
secure
of
that
happiness
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
quest
of
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
I
saunter
in
company
with
doctor
Wagtail
,
to
that
part
of
the
town
in
which
my
inamorata
live
;
and
as
he
be
a
meer
register
,
enquire
of
him
into
the
name
,
character
and
fortune
of
every
body
who
possess
a
good
house
in
the
street
through
which
we
pass
:
    
<EOS>
when
it
come
to
his
turn
to
mention
Sir
John
Sparkle
,
he
represent
him
as
a
man
of
an
immense
estate
and
narrow
disposition
,
who
mew
up
his
only
child
,
a
fine
young
lady
,
from
the
conversation
of
mankind
,
under
the
strict
watch
and
inspection
of
an
old
gouvernante
,
who
be
either
so
honest
,
envious
or
insatiable
,
that
no
body
have
be
,
as
yet
,
able
to
make
her
a
friend
,
or
get
access
to
her
charge
,
though
number
attempt
it
every
day
;
not
so
much
on
account
of
her
expectation
from
her
father
,
who
be
a
widower
,
may
marry
again
,
and
have
son
,
as
for
a
fortune
of
twelve
thousand
pound
leave
her
by
an
uncle
,
of
which
she
could
not
be
deprive
.
 
<EOS>
this
piece
of
news
exactly
tally
with
the
last
part
of
the
letter
I
have
be
honour
with
in
the
morning
,
have
such
an
effect
on
me
,
that
any
man
,
except
Wagtail
,
may
have
observe
my
emotion
;
but
his
attention
be
too
much
engross
on
the
contemplation
of
his
own
importance
,
to
be
affect
with
the
deportment
of
any
other
body
,
unless
it
happen
to
be
so
particular
,
that
he
could
not
help
take
notice
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
have
disengage
myself
from
him
,
whose
conversation
grow
insipid
to
me
,
I
go
home
,
and
make
Strap
acquaint
with
the
fruit
of
my
research
.
 
<EOS>
this
faithful
Squire
be
almost
choaked
with
transport
,
and
even
weep
for
joy
;
but
whether
on
account
of
himself
or
me
,
I
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
a
third
billet
doux
be
bring
to
me
,
contain
many
expression
of
tenderness
,
mingle
with
some
affect
doubt
about
the
artifice
of
man
,
the
inconstancy
of
youth
,
and
the
jealously
often
attend
the
most
sincere
passion
;
withal
desire
<EOS>
I
would
excuse
her
,
if
she
should
try
me
a
little
longer
,
before
she
declare
herself
beyond
the
power
of
retract
.
 
<EOS>
these
interesting
scruple
add
fuel
to
my
flame
,
and
impatience
to
my
hope
;
I
redouble
my
complaint
of
her
indifference
,
and
press
her
to
an
assignation
,
with
such
fervid
intreatie
,
that
in
a
few
day
,
she
consent
to
meet
me
at
the
house
of
that
milliner
,
who
have
forward
all
my
letter
.
     
<EOS>
during
the
interval
between
the
date
of
her
promise
,
and
the
hour
of
appointment
,
my
pride
soar
beyond
all
reason
and
description
;
I
lose
all
remembrance
of
the
gentle
Narcissa
,
and
my
thought
be
wholly
employ
in
plan
triumph
over
the
malice
and
contempt
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
the
happy
hour
arrive
,
I
fly
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
and
be
conduct
into
an
apartment
,
where
I
have
not
wait
ten
minute
,
when
I
hear
the
rustling
of
silk
and
the
find
of
foot
ascend
the
stair
:
<EOS>
My
heart
take
the
alarm
,
and
beat
quick
,
my
cheek
glow
,
my
nerve
thrill
,
and
my
knee
shake
with
exstasy
!
<EOS>
I
perceive
the
door
opening
,
see
a
gold
brocade
petticoat
advance
,
and
spring
forward
to
embrace
my
charmer
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
paint
my
situation
,
when
I
find
Miss
Sparkle
convert
into
a
wrinkle
hag
turn
of
seventy
!
<EOS>
I
be

dumb
with
amazement
,
and
petrify
with
horror
!
<EOS>
this
ancient
urganda
perceive
my
disorder
,
and
approach
with
a
languish
air
,

my

in
a
squeak
tone
,
if
I
be
indispose

<EOS>
Her
monstrous
affectation
compleate
the
disgust
I
have
conceive
for
her
at
her
first
appearance
;
and
it
be
a
long
time
before
I
could
command
myself
so
much
,
as
to
behave
with
common
civility
:
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
I
recollect
myself
and
pronounce
an
apology
for
my
behaviour
,
which
,
I
say
,
proceed
from
a
dizziness
that
seize
me
all
of
a
sudden
.
 
<EOS>
My
hoary
Dulcinea
,
who
,
no
doubt
,
have
be
alarm
at
my
confusion
,
no
sooner
learn
the
cause
to
which
I
now
ascribe
it
,
than
she
discover
her
joy
in
a
thousand
amorous
coquettrie
,
and
assume
the
sprightly
art
of
a
girl
of
sixteen
.
    
<EOS>
one
<EOS>
while
,
she
ogle
me
with
her
dim
eye
,
quench
in
rheum
;
then
,
as
if
she
be
ashamed
of
that
freedom
,
she
affect
to
look
down
,
blush
,
and
play
with
her
fan
,
then
toss
her
head
that
I
may
not
perceive
a
palsy
that
shake
it
,
ask
some
childish
question
with
a
lisp
accent
,
giggle
and
grin
with
her
mouth
shut
,
to
conceal
the
ravage
of
time
upon
her
tooth
,
leer
upon
me
again
,
sigh
piteously
,
fle
herself
about
in
her
chair
to
shew
her
agility
,
and
act
a
great
many
more
absurdity
that
youth
and
beauty
can
alone
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
Shocked
as
I
be
at
my
disappointment
,
my
disposition
be
incapable
of
affront
any
person
who
love
me
;
I
therefore
endeavour
to
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
for
the
present
,
resolve
to
drop
the
whole
affair
as
soon
as
I
should
get
clear
of
her
company
;
with
this
view
,
I
utter
some
civil
thing
,
and
in
particular
desire
to
know
the
name
and
condition
of
the
lady
who
have
honour
me
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
her
name
be
Withers
,
that
she
live
with
Sir
John
Sparkle
in
quality
of
governess
to
his
only
daughter
,
in
which
situation
she
have
pick
up
a
comfortable
sufficiency
to
make
her
easy
for
life
;
that
she
have
the
pleasure
of
see
me
at
church
,
where
my
appearance
and
deportment
make
such
an
impression
upon
her
heart
,
that
she
could
enjoy
no
ease
until
she
have
inquire
into
my
character
,
which
she
find
so
amiable
in
all
respect
,
that
she
yield
to
the
violence
of
her
inclination
,
and
venture
to
declare
her
passion
,
with
too
little
regard
,
perhaps
,
to
the
decorum
of
her
sex
;
but
she
hope
I
would
forgive
a
trespass
,
of
which
I
myself
be
,
in
some
measure
,
the
cause
,
and
impute
her
intrusion
to
the
irresistible
dictate
of
love
.
     
<EOS>
no
decay
rake
ever
swallow
a
bolus
with
more
reluctance
than
I
feel
in
make
a
reply
suitable
to
the
compliment
,
when
instead
of
the
jewel
,
I
find
the
crazy
casket
only
in
my
power
;
and
yet
my
hope
begin
to
revive
a
little
,
when
I
consider
,
that
by
carry
on
the
appearance
of
an
intrigue
with
the
Duenna
,
I
may
possibly
get
access
to
her
charge
.
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
suggestion
,
my
temper
grow
more
serene
,
my
reserve
wear
off
,
I
talk
en
cavalier
,
and
even
make
love
to
this
antiquated
coquette
,
who
seem
extremely
happy
in
her
adorer
,
and
spread
all
her
allurement
to
make
her
imagine
conquest
more
secure
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
woman
of
the
house
treat
us
with
tea
and
sweet
-
meat
,
and
afterwards
withdraw
,
like
a
civil
experienced
matron
as
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
leave
thus
to
our
mutual
endearment
,
Miss
Withers
<EOS>
(
for
she
be
still
a
maiden
)
begin
to
talk
of
matrimony
,
and
express
so
much
impatience
in
all
her
behaviour
,
that
,
have
she
be
fifty
year
young
,
I
may
possibly
have
gratify
her
longing
without
have
recourse
to
the
church
;
but
this
my
virtue
as
well
as
interest
forbad
.
<EOS>
when
the
inclination
of
an
old
maid
settle
upon
a
young
fellow
,
he
be
persecute
with
her
address
;
but
,
should
he
once
grant
her
the
favour
,
he
will
never
be
able
to
disentangle
himself
from
her
importunity
and
reproach
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
my
business
to
defer
the
ceremony
as
long
as
possible
under
the
most
specious
pretence
,
with
a
view
of
become
acquaint
with
Miss
Sparkle
,
in
the
mean
time
;
and
I
do
not
despair
of
success
,
when
I
consider
,
that
in
the
course
of
our
correspondence
I
would
,
in
all
probability
,
be
invite
to
visit
my
mistress
in
her
own
apartment
,
and
by
that
mean
have
an
opportunity
of
converse
with
her
charming
ward
.
<EOS>
pleased
with
this
prospect
,
my
heart
dilate
with
joy
,
I
talk
in
rapture
to
the
stale
gouvernante
,
and
kiss
her
shrivel
hand
with
great
devotion
:
She
be
so
much
transport
with
her
good
fortune
,
that
she
could
not
contain
her
exstasy
,
but
fly
upon
me
like
a
tygeress
,
and
press
her
skinny
lip
to
mine
;
when
(
as
it
be
no
doubt
concerted
by
her
evil
genius
)
<EOS>
a
dose
of
garlick
she
have
swallow
that
morning
,
to
dispel
wind
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
begin
to
operate
with
such
a
sudden
explosion
,
that
human
nature
,
circumstance
as
I
be
,
could
not
endure
the
shock
with
any
degree
of
temper
.
 
<EOS>
I
lose
all
patience
and
reflection
,
fling
away
from
her
in
an
instant
,
snatch
my
hat
and
cane
,
and
run
down
stair
as
the
devil
have
me
in
pursuit
,
and
could
scarce
restrain
the
convulsion
of
my
bowel
,
which
be
grievously
offend
by
the
perfume
that
assault
me
.
 
<EOS>
Strap
,
who
wait
my
return
with
impatience
,
see
me
arrive
in
the
utmost
disorder
,
stand
motionless
with
apprehension
,
and
durst
not
enquire
into
the
cause
.
    
<EOS>
after
I
have
wash
my
mouth
more
than
once
,
and
recruit
my
spirit
with
a
glass
of
wine
,
I
recount
to
him
every
particular
of
what
have
happen
;
to
which
he
make
no
other
reply
,
for
some
time
,
than
lift
up
his
eye
,
clasp
his
hand
,
and
utter
a
hollow
groan
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
observe
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
,
that
it
be
a
thousand
pity
<EOS>
my
organ
be
so
delicate
as
to
be
offend
with
the
smell
of
garlick
:
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
God
help
us
(
say
he
)
'
<EOS>
tis
not
the
steam
of
garlick
,
no
,
nor
of
something
else
<EOS>
,
that
would
give
me
the
least
uneasiness
 
<EOS>
see
what
it
be
to
be
a
cobler
's
son
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
reply
hastily
,
"
I
wish
then
,
you
would
go
and
retrieve
my
miscarriage
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
he
start
,
force
a
smile
,
and
leave
the
room
,
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
whether
the
old
gentlewoman
resent
my
abrupt
departure
so
much
,
that
her
love
change
into
disdain
,
or
be
ashamed
to
see
me
on
account
of
her
infirmity
,
I
know
not

I
be
never
trouble
again
with
her

fall
in

with
my

which
I
press
upon
him
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
present
of
a
diamond
ring
to
lord
Straddle
 
impart
my
good
fortune
to
Strap
and
Banter
,
who
dissabuse
me
,
to
my
utter
mortification
.
  
<EOS>
baffle
hitherto
in
my
matrimonial
scheme
,
I
begin
to
question
my
talent
for
the
science
of
fortune
-
hunting
,
and
to
bend
my
thought
towards
some
employment
under
the
government
.
     
<EOS>
with
the
view
of
procuring
which
,
I
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
Lords
Straddle
and
Swillpot
,
whose
father
be
man
of
interest
at
court
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
these
young
nobleman
as
open
to
my
advance
as
I
could
desire
:
I
accompany
them
in
their
midnight
ramble
,
and
often
dine
with
them
at
tavern
,
where
I
have
the
honour
of
pay
the
reckoning
.
    
<EOS>
I
one
day
take
the
opportunity
,
while
I
be
load
with
protestation
of
friendship
,
to
disclose
my
desire
of
be
settle
in
some
sine
-
cure
;
and
to
solicit
their
influence
in
my
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
Swillpot
squeeze
my
hand
,
say
,
I
may
depend
upon
his
service
,
by
G
-
d
.
<EOS>
the
other
swore
that
no
man
would
be
more
proud
than
he
to
run
my
errand
.
<EOS>
encourage
by
these
declaration
I
venture
to
express
an
inclination
to
be
introduce
to
their
father
,
who
be
able
to
do
my
business
at
once
.
<EOS>
swillpot
frankly
own
he
have
not
speak
to
his
father
these
three
year
;
and
Straddle
assure
me
his
father
have
lately
disoblige
the
Minister
by
subscribe
his
name
to
a
protest
in
the
house
of
peers
,
be
thereby
render
incapable
of
serve
his
friend
at
present
;
but
he
undertake
to
make
me
acquaint
with
Earl
Strutwell
,
who
be
hand
and
glove
with
a
certain
person
that
rule
the
roast
.
<EOS>
this
offer
I
embrace
with
many
acknowledgment
,
and
ply
him
so
closely
,
in
spite
of
a
thousand
evasion
,
that
he
find
himself
under
a
necessity
of
keep
his
word
,
and
actually
carry
me
to
the
levee
of
this
great
man
,
where
he
leave
me
in
a
crowd
of
fellow
-
dependant
,
and
be
usher
to
a
particular
closet
audience
;
from
whence
in
a
few
minute
,
he
return
with
his
lordship
,
who
take
me
by
the
hand
,
assure
me
he
would
do
me
all
the
service
he
could
,
and
desire
to
see
me
often
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
charm
with
my
reception
,
and
although
I
have
hear
that
a
courtier
's
promise
be
not
to
be
depend
upon
,
I
think
I
discover
so
much
sweetness
of
temper
and
candour
in
this
Earl
's
countenance
,
that
I
do
not
doubt
of
profit
by
his
protection
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolve
therefore
,
to
avail
myself
of
his
permission
,
and
wait
on
him
next
audience
day
,
when
I
be
favour
with
a
particular
smile
,
squeeze
of
the
hand
,
and
a
whisper
,
signify
that
he
want
half
an
hour
's
conversation
with
me
tete
a
tete
,
when
he
should
be
disengage
,
and
for
that
purpose
desire
me
to
come
and
drink
a
dish
of
chocolate
with
him
tomorrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
this
invitation
,
which
do
not
a
little
flat
my
vanity
and
expectation
,
I
take
care
to
observe
,
and
go
to
his
lordship
's
house
at
the
time
appoint
.
<EOS>
have
rap
at
the
gate
,
the
porter
unbolted
and
keep
it
half
open
,
place
himself
in
the
gap
,
like
soldier
in
a
breach
,
to
dispute
my
passage
.
 
<EOS>
I
demand
to
know
if
his
lord
be
stir
?
 
<EOS>
He
answer
with
a
surly
aspect
,
"
no
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
what
hour
do
he
commonly
rise
?
<EOS>
(
say
i
)
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
sometimes
sooner
,
sometimes
later
(
say
he
,
close
the
door
upon
me
by
degree
.
)
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
then
tell
him
I
be
come
by
his
lordship
's
own
appointment
;
to
which
this
Cerberus
reply
,
"
I
have
receive
no
order
about
the
matter
;
"
and
be
upon
the
point
of
shut
me
out
,
when
I
recollect
myself
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
slip
a
crown
into
his
hand
,
beg
as
a
favour
that
he
would
enquire
and
let
me
know
whether
or
not
the
Earl
be
up
.
    
<EOS>
the
grim
janitor
relent
at
the
touch
of
my
money
,
which
he
take
with
all
the
indifference
of
a
tax
-
gatherer
,
and
shew
me
into
a
parlour
,
where
,
he
say
,
I
may
amuse
myself
till
such
time
as
his
lord
should
be
awake
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
sit
ten
minute
in
this
place
,
when
a
footman
enter
,
and
without
speak
,
stare
at
me
;
I
interpret
this
piece
of
his
behaviour
into
"
Pray
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
what
be
your
business
?
"
and
ask
the
same
question
I
have
put
to
the
porter
,
when
I
accost
him
first
.
<EOS>
the
lacquey
make
the
same
reply
,
and
disappear
before
I
could
get
any
further
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
he
return
,
on
pretence
of
poke
the
fire
,
and
look
at
me
again
with
great
earnestness
;
upon
which
I
begin
to
perceive
his
meaning
,
and
tip
him
with
half
a
crown
,
desire
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
fall
upon
some
method
of
let
the
Earl
know
that
I
be
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
low
bow
,
say
,
"
yes
,
Sir
,
"
and
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
this
bounty
be
not
throw
away
,
for
in
an
instant
he
come
back
,
and
conduct
me
to
a
chamber
,
where
I
be
receive
with
great
kindness
and
familiarity
by
his
lordship
,
whom
I
find
just
rise
,
in
his
morning
gown
and
slipper
.
 
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
he
enter
into
a
particular
conversation
with
me
about
my
travel
,
the
remark
I
have
make
abroad
,
and
examine
me
to
the
full
extent
of
my
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
My
answer
seem
to
please
him
very
much
,
he
frequently
squeeze
my
hand
,
and
look
at
me
with
a
singular
complacency
in
his
countenance
,
bid
me
depend
upon
his
good
office
with
the
ministry
in
my
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
"
young
man
of
your
qualification
(
say
he
)
ought
to
be
cherish
by
every
administration
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
see
so
little
merit
in
the
world
,
that
I
have
lay
it
down
as
a
maxim
,
to
encourage
the
least
appearance
of
genius
and
virtue
,
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
great
deal
of
both
;
and
will
not
fail
of
make
a
figure
one
day
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
;

you
must
lay
your
account
with

by
gradual
step

<EOS>
I
assure
his
lordship
,
with
great
eagerness
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
my
inclination
:
<EOS>
upon
which
he
bid
me
make
myself
easy
,
my
business
be
do
,
for
he
have
a
place
of
that
kind
in
his
view
.
 
<EOS>
this
piece
of
generosity
affect
me
so
much
,
that
I
be
unable
for
some
time
to
express
my
gratitude
,
which
at
length
break
out
in
acknowledgment
of
my
own
unworthiness
,
and
encomium
on
his
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
help
shed
tear
,
at
the
goodness
of
this
noble
lord
,
who
no
sooner
perceive
them
,
than
he
catch
me
in
his
arm
,
hug
and
kiss
me
with
a
seemingly
paternal
affection
.
 
<EOS>
confound
at
this
uncommon
instance
of
fondness
for
a
stranger
,
I
remain
a
few
moment
silent
and
ashamed
,
then
get
up
and
take
my
leave
,
after
he
have
assure
me
that
he
would
speak
to
the
Minister
in
my
favour
,
that
very
day
;
and
desire
that
I
would
not
for
the
future
give
myself
the
trouble
of
attend
at
his
levee
,
but
come
at
the
same
hour
every
day
,
when
he
be
at
leisure
,
which
be
three
time
a
week
.
    
<EOS>
though
my
hope
be
now
very
sanguine
,
I
determine
to
conceal
my
prospect
from
every
body
,
even
from
Strap
,
until
I
should
be
more
certain
of
success
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
give
my
patron
no
respite
from
my
sollicitation
.
     
<EOS>
when
I
renew
my
visit
,
I
find
the
three
door
open
to
me
as
if
by
enchantment
;
but
in
my
passage
towards
the
presence
-
room
,
I
be
meet
by
the
valet
de
chambre
,
who
cast
some
furious
look
at
me
,
the
meaning
of
which
I
could
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
salute
me
at
entrance
with
a
tender
embrace
,
and
wish
me
joy
of
his
success
with
the
Premier
,
who
,
he
say
,
have
prefer
his
recommendation
to
that
of
two
other
nobleman
very
urgent
in
behalf
of
their
respective
friend
,
and
absolutely
promise
that
I
should
go
to
a
certain
foreign
court
in
quality
of
secretary
to
an
embassador
and
plenipotentiary
,
who
would
set
out
in
a
few
week
,
on
an
affair
of
vast
importance
to
the
nation
.
<EOS>
I
be
thunder
-
strike
with
my
good
fortune
,
and
could
make
no
other
reply
,
than
kneel
and
attempt
to
kiss
my
benefactor
's
hand
,
which
he
would
not
permit
,
but
raise
me
up
,
press
me
to
his
breast
with
surprizing
emotion
,
and
tell
me
he
have
now
take
upon
himself
the
care
of
make
my
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
what
inhance
the
value
of
the
benefit
still
the
more
,
be
his
make
light
of
the
favour
,
and
shift
the
conversation
to
another
subject
:
among
other
topick
of
discourse
,
that
of
the
Belle
Lettre
be
introduce
,
upon
which
his
lordship
hold
forth
with
great
taste
and
erudition
,
and
discover
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
author
of
antiquity
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
book
(
say
he
,
take
one
from
his
bosom
)
<EOS>
write
with
great
elegance
and
spirit
,
and
though
the
subject
may
give
offence
to
some
narrow
-
minded
people
,
the
author
will
always
be
hold
in
esteem
by
every
person
of
sense
and
learning
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
put
into
my
hand
Petronius
Arbiter
,
and
ask
my
opinion
of
his
wit
and
manner
.
     
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
that
in
my
opinion
,
he
write
with
great
ease
and
vivacity
,
but
be
withal
so
lewd
and
indecent
,
that
he
ought
to
find
no
quarter
or
protection
among
people
of
moral
and
taste
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
own
(
reply
the
Earl
)
that
his
taste
in
love
be
generally
decry
,
and
indeed
condemn
by
our
law
;
but
perhaps
that
may
be
more
owing
to
prejudice
and
misapprehension
,
than
to
true
reason
and
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
man
among
the
ancient
be
say
to
have
entertain
that
passion
;
one
of
the
wise
of
their
legislator
have
permit
the
indulgence
of
it
in
his
commonwealth
;
the
most
celebrated
poet
have
not
scruple
to
avow
it
at
this
day
;
it
prevail
not
only
over
all
the
east
,
but
in
most
part
of
Europe
;
in
our
own
country
it
gain
ground
apace
,
and
in
all
probability
will
become
in
a
short
time
a
more
fashionable
vice
than
simple
fornication
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
something
to
be
say
in
vindication
of
it
,
for
notwithstanding
the
severity
of
the
law
against
offender
in
this
way
<EOS>
,
it
must
be
confess
that
the
practice
of
this
passion
be
unattende
with
that
curse
and
burthen
upon
society
,
which
proceed
from
a
race
of
miserable
deserted
bastard
,
who
be
either
murder
by
their
parent
,
desert
to
the
utmost
want
and
wretchedness
,
or
breed
up
to
prey
upon
the
commonwealth
:
<EOS>
and
it
likewise
prevent
the
debauchery
of
many
a
young
maiden
,
and
the
prostitution
of
honest
man
's
wife
;
not
to
mention
the
consideration
of
health
,
which
be
much
less
liable
to
be
impair
in
the
gratification
of
this
appetite
,
than
in
the
exercise
of
common
venery
,
which
by
ruin
the
constitution
of
our
young
man
,
have
produce
a
puny
progeny
that
degenerate
from
generation
to
generation
:
    
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
have
be
tell
,
that
there
be
another
motive
perhaps
more
powerful
than
all
these
,
that
induce
people
to
cultivate
this
inclination
;
namely
,
the
exquisite
pleasure
attend
its
success
.
"
    
<EOS>
from
this
discourse
,
I
begin
to
be
apprehensive
that
his
lordship
find
I
have
travel
,
be
afraid
I
may
have
be
infect
with
this
spurious
and
sordid
desire
abroad
,
and
take
this
method
of
sound
my
sentiment
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
fire
at
this
suppose
suspicion
,
I
argue
against
it
with
great
warmth
,
as
an
appetite
unnatural
,
absurd
,
and
of
pernicious
consequence
;
and
declare
my
utter
detestation
and
abhorrence
of
it
in
these
line
of
the
satyrist
.
    
<EOS>
"
Eternal
infamy
the
wretch
confound
 
<EOS>
"
who
plant
first
,
this
vice
on
british
ground
!
 
<EOS>
"
a
vice
!
<EOS>
that
"
spite
of
sense
and
nature
reign
,
 
"
and
poison
genial
love
,
and
manhood
stain
!
"
    
<EOS>
the
Earl
smile
at
my
indignation
,
tell
me
he
be
glad
to
find
my
opinion
of
the
matter
so
conformable
to
his
own
,
and
that
what
he
have
advance
be
only
to
provoke
me
to
an
answer
,
with
which
he
profess
himself
perfectly
well
pleased
.
    
<EOS>
after
I
have
enjoy
a
long
audience
,
I
happen
to
look
at
my
watch
,
in
order
to
regulate
my
motion
by
it
;
and
his
lordship
observe
the
chase
case
,
desire
to
see
the
device
,
and
examine
the
execution
,
which
he
approve
with
some
expression
of
admiration
.
     
<EOS>
consider
the
obligation
I
lie
under
to
his
lordship
,
I
think
there
could
not
be
a
fitter
opportunity
than
the
present
to
manifest
,
in
some
shape
,
my
gratitude
;
I
therefore
beg
he
would
do
me
the
honour
to
accept
of
the
watch
as
a
small
testimony
of
the
sense
I
have
of
his
lordship
's
generosity
;
but
he
refuse
it
in
a
peremptory
manner
,
and
say
he
be
sorry
I
should
entertain
such
a
mercenary
opinion
of
him
,
observe
at
the
same
time
,
that
it
be
the
most
beautiful
piece
of
workmanship
he
have
ever
see
;
and
desire
to
know
where
he
could
have
such
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
a
thousand
pardon
for
the
freedom
I
have
take
,
which
I
hope
he
would
impute
to
nothing
else
than
the
high
veneration
for
his
person
 
<EOS>
let
him
know
that
as
it
come
to
my
hand
by
accident
in
France
,
I
could
give
him
no
information
about
the
maker
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
no
name
on
the
inside
;
and
once
more
humbly
entreat
that
he
would
indulge
me
so
far
as
to
use
it
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
still
positive
in
refuse
it
;
but
be
pleased
to
thank
me
for
my
generous
offer
,
say
,
it
be
a
present
that
no
nobleman
need
be
ashamed
of
receive
;
though
he
be
resolve
to
shew
his
disinterestedness
with
regard
to
me
,
for
whom
he
have
conceive
a
particular
friendship
;
and
insist
(
if
I
be
willing
to
part
with
the
watch
)
upon
know
what
it
cost
,
that
he
may
at
least
indemnify
me
,
by
refund
the
money
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
I
assure
his
lordship
,
that
I
would
look
upon
it
as
an
uncommon
mark
of
distinction
,
if
he
would
take
it
without
further
question
;
and
rather
than
disoblige
me
,
he
be
at
last
persuade
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
,
to
my
no
small
satisfaction
,
who
take
my
leave
immediately
,
after
have
receive
a
kind
squeeze
,
and
an
injunction
to
depend
upon
his
promise
.
    
<EOS>
buoy
up
with
my
reception
<EOS>
,
my
heart
open
,
I
give
away
a
guinea
among
the
lacquey
,
who
escort
me
to
the
door
,
fly
to
the
lodging
of
Lord
Straddle
,
upon
whom
I
force
my
diamond
ring
,
as
an
acknowledgment
for
the
great
service
he
have
do
me
,
and
from
thence
hie
myself
home
,
with
an
intent
of
share
my
happiness
with
honest
Strap
.
 
<EOS>
I
determine
,
however
,
to
heighten
his
pleasure
by
depress
his
spirit
at
first
,
and
then
bring
in
the
good
news
with
double
relish
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
I
affect
the
appearance
of
disappointment
and
chagrin
,
and
tell
him
in
an
abrupt
manner
,
that
I
have
lose
the
watch
and
diamond
.
<EOS>
poor
Hugh
,
who
have
be
already
harrasse
into
a
consumption
by
intelligence
of
this
sort
,
no
sooner
hear
these
word
,
than
,
unable
to
contain
himself
,
he
cry
with
distraction
in
his
look
,
"
God
in
heaven
forbid
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
carry
on
the
farce
no
longer
,
but
laugh
in
his
face
,
tell
him
every
thing
that
have
befall
,
as
above
recite
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
immediately
unbend
,
and
the
transition
so
affect
,
that
he
weep
with
joy
,
call
my
Lord
Strutwell
by
the
appellation
of
Jewel
,
Phoenix
,
Rara
avi
,
and
praise
God
,
that
there
be
still
some
virtue
leave
among
our
nobility
.
 
<EOS>
Our
mutual
congratulation
be
over
,
we
give
way
to
our
imagination
,
and
anticipate
our
happiness
by
prosecute
my
success
through
the
different
step
of
promotion
,
till
I
arrive
at
the
rank
of
a
prime
minister
,
and
he
to
that
of
my
first
secretary
.
    
<EOS>
intoxicate
with
these
idea
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
ordinary
,
where
,
meet
with
Banter
,
I
communicate
the
whole
affair
in
confidence
to
him
,
conclude
with
an
assurance
that
I
would
do
him
all
the
service
in
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
hear
me
to
an
end
with
great
patience
,
then
regard
me
a
good
while
with
a
look
of
disdain
,
pronounce
,
"
so

think

Strutwell
and
Straddle

I
would
without
any
more
ado
tuck
myself
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
shock
at
this
exclamation
,
I
desire
him
with
some
confusion
to
explain
himself
:
upon
which
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
Straddle
be
a
poor
contemptible
wretch
,
who
live
by
borrow
and
pimp
to
his
fellow
peer
;
that
in
consequence
of
this
last
capacity
,
he
have
,
doubtless
,
introduce
me
to
Strutwell
,
who
be
so
notorious
for
a
passion
for
his
own
sex
,
that
he
be
amazed
his
character
have
never
reach
my
ear
;
and
that
so
far
from
be
able
to
obtain
for
me
the
post
he
have
promise
,
his
interest
at
court
be
so
low
,
that
he
could
scarce
provide
for
a
superannuated
footman
once
a
year
,
in
Chelsea
-
hospital
;
 
that
it
be
a
common
thing
for
him
to
amuse
stranger
whom
his
jack
-
call
run
down
,
with
such
assurance
and
caress
as
he
have
bestow
on
me
,
until
he
have
stript
them
of
their
cash
and
every
thing
valuable
about
them
;
 
very
often
of
their
chastity
,
and
then
leave
them
a
prey
to
want
and
infamy
;
 
that
he
allow
his
servant
no
other
wage
than
that
part
of
the
spoil
which
they
could
glean
by
their
industry
;
and
that
the
whole
of
his
conduct
towards
me
be
so
glaring
,
that
no
body
who
know
any
thing
of
mankind
could
have
be
impose
upon
by
his
insinuation

I
leave
the

to
judge
how
I
relish
this
piece
of

which
precipitate
me
from
the
most
exalted
pinnacle
of
hope
to
the
low
abyss
of
despondence

well
nigh
determine
me
to
take
Banter

advice

finish
my
chagrin
with
a
halter

<EOS>
I
have
no
room
to
suspect
the
veracity
of
my
friend
,
because
upon
recollection
,
I
find
every
circumstance
of
Strutwell
's
behaviour
,
exactly
tally
with
the
character
he
have
describe
:
His
hug
,
embrace
,
squeeze
and
eager
look
,
be
now
no
longer
a
mystery
;
no
more
than
his
defence
of
Petronius
,
and
the
jealous
frown
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
,
it
seem
,
be
at
present
the
favourite
pathic
of
his

at
the
same
time
,
to
oblige
my
friend
.
     
<EOS>
Stupified
as
I
be
,
I
could
easily
divine
the
source
of
his
concern
,
but
sneak
away
in
a
solitary
manner
,
without
yield
the
least
answer
to
his
expostulation
;
and
begin
to
deliberate
with
myself
,
in
what
manner
I
should
attempt
to
retrieve
the
moveable
I
have
so
foolishly
lose
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
think
it
no
robbery
to
take
them
again
by
force
,
could
I
have
do
it
without
any
danger
of
be
detect
;
but
as
I
could
have
no
such
opportunity
,
I
resolve
to
work
by
finesse
,
and
go
immediately
to
the
lodging
of
Straddle
,
where
I
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
I
have
just
now
recollect
,
that
the
diamond
I
have
the
honour
of
present
to
you
<EOS>
,
be
loosen
a
little
in
the
socket
,
and
there
be
a
young
fellow
just
arrive
from
Paris
,
who
be
reckon
the
good
jeweller
in
Europe
;
I
know
him
in
France
,
and
if
your
lordship
will
give
me
leave
,
will
carry
the
ring
to
him
to
be
set
to
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
lordship
be
not
to
be
catch
in
this
snare
 
<EOS>
he
thank
me
for
my
offer
,
and
let
me
know
,
that
have
himself
observe
the
defect
,
he
have
already
send
it
to
his
own
jeweller
to
be
mend
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
by
this
time
,
I
believe
it
be
in
the
jeweller
's
hand
,
though
not
in
order
to
be
mend
,
for
it
stand
in
need
of
no
alteration
.
    
<EOS>
Baulked
in
this
piece
of
politick
,
I
curse
my
simplicity
;
but
resolve
to
play
a
sure
game
with
the
Earl
,
which
I
have
thus
devise
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
of
be
admit
into
familiar
conversation
with
him
,
as
before
,
and
hope
by
some
mean
,
to
get
the
watch
into
my
hand
,
then
on
pretence
of
winding
or
play
with
it
,
drop
it
on
the
floor
,
which
in
all
probability
would
disorder
the
work
so
as
to
stop
its
motion
:
    
this
event
would
furnish
me
with
an
opportunity
of
insist
upon
carry
it
away
in
order
to
be
repair
;
and
have
this
happen
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
be
in
no
hurry
to
bring
it
back
.
 
<EOS>
what
pity
it
be
I
could
not
find
an
occasion
of
put
this
fine
scheme
in
execution
!
<EOS>
when
I
go
to
renew
my
visit
to
his
lordship
,
my
access
to
the
parlour
be
as
free
as
ever
;
but
after
I
have
wait
some
time
,
the
valet
de
chambre
come
in
with
his
Lord
's
compliment
,
and
a
desire
to
see
me
to
-
morrow
at
his
levee
,
be
at
present
so
much
indisposed
that
he
could
not
see
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
inteprete
this
message
into
a
bad
oman
,
and
come
away
mutter
curse
against
his
lordship
's
politeness
,
and
ready
to
go
to
loggerhead
with
myself
for
be
so
egregiously
dupe
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
I
may
have
some
satisfaction
for
the
loss
I
have
sustain
<EOS>
,
I
besiege
him
closely
at
his
levee
,
and
persecute
him
with
my
solicitation
;
not
without
faint
hope
indeed
,
of
reap
something
more
from
my
industry
,
than
the
bare
pleasure
of
make
him
uneasy
;
though
I
could
never
obtain
another
private
hearing
,
during
the
whole
course
of
my
attendance
;
neither
have
I
resolution
enough
,
<EOS>
to
undeceive
Strap
,
whose
look
in
a
little
time
,
be
so
whet
with
impatience
,
that
whenever
I
come
home
,
his
eye
devour
me
,
as
it
be
,
with
eagerness
of
attention
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
find
myself
reduce
to
my
last
guinea
,
I
be
compel
to
disclose
my
necessity
,
though
I
endeavour
to
sweeten
the
discovery
by
rehearse
to
him
the
daily
assurance
I
receive
from
my
patron
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
promise
be
not
of
efficacy
sufficient
to
support
the
spirit
of
my
friend
,
who
no
sooner
understand
the
lowness
of
my
finance
,
than
utter
a
dreadful
groan
<EOS>
,
he
exclaim
,
"
in
the
name
of
God
,
what
shall
we
do
?
"
    
<EOS>
in
order
to
comfort
him
,
I
say
that
many
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
be
in
a
bad
condition
than
we
,
support
,
notwithstanding
,
the
character
and
appearance
of
gentleman
;
and
advise
him
to
thank
God
that
we
have
as
yet
incur
no
debt
,
propose
he
should
pawn
my
sword
of
steel
inlay
with
gold
,
and
trust
to
my
discretion
for
the
rest
.
<EOS>
this
expedient
be
wormwood
and
gall
to
poor
Strap
,
who
,
in
spite
of
his
invincible
affection
for
me
,
still
retain
notion
of
oeconomy
and
expence
suitable
to
the
narrowness
of
his
education
;
nevertheless
he
comply
with
my
request
,
and
raise
seven
piece
on
the
sword
in
a
twinkling
.
 
<EOS>
this
supply
,
inconsiderable
as
it
be
,
make
me
as
happy
for
the
present
,
as
if
I
have
have
five
hundred
pound
in
bank
;
for
by
this
time
I
be
so
well
skilled
in
procrastinate
every
troublesome
reflection
,
that
the
prospect
of
want
seldom
affect
me
very
much
,
let
it
be
ever
so
near
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
indeed
it
be
near
than
I
imagine
;
for
my
landlord
have
occasion
for
money
,
put
me
in
mind
of
my
be
indebte
to
him
five
guinea
in
lodging
;
and
tell
me
he
have
a
sum
to
make
up
,
beg
I
would
excuse
his
importunity
and
discharge
the
debt
.
<EOS>
though
I
could
ill
spare
so
much
cash
;
my
pride
take
the
resolution
of
disburse
it
,
which
I
do
in
a
cavalier
manner
,
after
he
have
write
a
discharge
,
tell
him
with
an
air
of
scorn
and
resentment
,
I
see
he
be
resolve
that
I
should
not
be
long
in
his
book
;
while
Strap
,
who
stand
by
,
and
know
my
circumstance
,
wrung
his
hand
in
secret
,
gnaw
his
nether
lip
,
and
turn
yellow
with
despair
.
     
<EOS>
whatever
appearance
of
indifference
my
vanity
enable
me
to
put
on
,
I
be
thunderstruck
with
this
demand
,
which
I
have
no
sooner
satisfied
,
than
I
hasten
into
company
,
with
a
view
of
beguile
my
care
with
conversation
,
or
of
drown
them
in
wine
.
    
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
a
party
be
accordingly
make
in
the
coffee
-
house
,
<EOS>
from
whence
we
adjourn
to
the
tavern
,
where
instead
of
share
the
mirth
of
the
company
,
I
be
as
much
chagrin
at
their
good
humour
as
a
damned
soul
in
hell
would
be
at
a
glimpse
of
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
do
I
swallow
bumper
after
bumper
!
<EOS>
the
wine
have
lose
its
effect
upon
me
,
and
so
far
from
raise
my
dejected
spirit
,
could
not
even
lay
me
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
Banter
,
who
be
the
only
intimate
<EOS>
I
have
(
Strap
except
)
<EOS>
perceive
my
anxiety
,
and
when
we
break
up
,
reproach
me
with
pusilanimity
,
for
be
cast
down
at
any
disappointment
that
such
a
rascal
as
Strutwell
could
be
the
occasion
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
do
not
at
all
<EOS>
see
how
Strutwell
's
be
a
rascal
alleviate
my
misfortune
;
and
give
him
to
understand
that
my
present
grief
do
not
so
much
proceed
from
that
disappointment
,
as
from
the
low
ebb
of
my
fortune
,
which
be
sink
to
something
less
than
two
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
declaration
,
he
cry
,
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
be
that
all
?
"
and
assure
me
<EOS>
,
there
be
a
thousand
way
of
live
in
town
without
fortune
,
he
himself
have
subsist
many
year
entirely
by
his
wit
.
 
<EOS>
I
express
an
eager
desire
of
be
acquaint
with
some
of
these
method
,
and
he
,
without
further
expostulation
,
bid
me
follow
him
.
     
<EOS>
He
conduct
me
to
a
house
under
the
piazza
in
Convent
Garden
,
which
we
enter
,
and
have
deliver
our
sword
to
a
grim
fellow
who
demand
them
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
-
case
,
ascend
to
the
second
story
,
where
I
see
multitude
of
people
stand
round
two
gaming
table
,
load
in
a
manner
,
with
gold
and
silver
.
 
<EOS>
My
conductor
let
me
know
that
this
be
the
house
of
a
worthy
Scotch
Lord
,
who
avail
himself
of
the
privilege
of
his
peerage
,
have
set
up
publick
gaming
table
,
from
the
profit
of
which
he
draw
a
comfortable
livelihood
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
explain
the
difference
between
the
sitter
and
the
better
;
characterize
the
first
as
old
rook
,
and
the
last
as
bubble
;
and
advise
me
to
try
my
fortune
at
the
silver
table
by
bet
a
crown
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
would
venture
any
thing
,
I
consider
the
company
more
particularly
,
and
there
appear
such
a
groupe
of
villainous
face
,
that
I
be
strike
with
horror
and
astonishment
at
the
sight
!
<EOS>
I
signify
my
surprize
to
Banter
,
who
whisper
in
my
ear
,
that
the
bulk
of
those
present
be
compose
of
sharper
,
highwayman
,
and
apprentice
,
who
have
embezzle
their
master
's
cash
,
make
a
desperate
push
in
this
place
,
to
make
up
their
deficiency
.
 
<EOS>
this
account
do
not
encourage
me
to
hazard
any
part
of
my
small
pittance
;
but
at
length
be
teize
by
the
importunity
of
my
friend
,
who
assure
me
there
be
no
danger
of
be
ill
use
,
people
be
hire
by
the
owner
to
see
justice
do
to
every
body
;
I
begin
by
risque
one
shilling
,
and
in
less
than
an
hour
,
my
winning
amount
to
thirty
.
 
<EOS>
convince
by
this
time
of
the
fairness
of
the
game
,
and
animate
with
success
,
there
be
no
need
of
further
persuasion
to
continue
the
play
<EOS>
:
I
lend
Banter
(
who
seldom
have
any
money
in
his
pocket
)
<EOS>
a
guinea
,
which
he
carry
to
the
gold
table
and
lose
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
borrow
another
,
but
find
me
deaf
to
his
argument
,
go
away
in
a
pet
.
     
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
my
gain
advance
to
six
piece
,
and
my
desire
of
more
increase
in
proportion
;
so
that
I
move
to
the
high
table
,
where
I
lay
half
a
guinea
on
every
throw
,
and
fortune
still
favour
me
<EOS>
,
I
become
a
sitter
,
in
which
capacity
I
remain
until
it
be
broad
day
;
when
I
find
myself
,
after
many
vicissitude
,
one
hundred
and
fifty
guinea
in
pocket
.
    
<EOS>
think
it
now
high
time
to
retire
with
my
booty
,
I
ask
if
any
body
would
take
my
place
,
and
make
a
motion
to
rise
;
upon
which
an
old
gascon
,
who
sit
opposite
to
me
,
and
of
whom
I
have
win
a
little
money
,
start
up
with
fury
in
his
look
,
cry
,
 
"
restez
foutre
,
restez
,
il
faut
donner
mai
mon
ravanchio
!
"
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
a
Jew
who
sit
near
the
other
,
insinuate
that
I
be
more
beholden
to
art
than
fortune
,
for
what
I
have
get
;
that
he
have
observe
me
wipe
the
table
very
often
,
and
that
some
of
the
division
seem
to
be
greasy
.
<EOS>
this
intimation
produce
a
great
deal
of
clamour
against
me
,
especially
among
the
loser
,
who
threatne
with
many
oath
and
imprecation
to
take
me
up
by
a
warrant
as
a
a
sharp
,
unless
I
would
compromise
the
affair
by
refund
the
great
part
of
my
winning
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
be
far
from
be
easy
under
this
accusation
,
I
rely
upon
my
innocence
,
threatne
in
my
turn
to
prosecute
the
Jew
for
defamation
,
and
boldly
offer
to
submit
my
cause
to
the
examination
of
any
justice
in
Westminster
;
but
they
know
themselves
too
well
to
put
their
character
on
that
issue
,
and
find
I
be
not
to
be
intimidate
into
any
concession
,
dropt
their
plea
,
and
make
way
for
me
to
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
however
,
stir
from
the
table
until
the
Israelite
have
retract
what
he
say
to
my
disadvantage
,
and
ask
pardon
before
the
whole
assembly
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
march
out
with
my
prize
,
I
happen
to
tread
upon
the
toe
of
a
tall
raw
-
bone
fellow
,
with
a
hooked
nose
,
fierce
eye
,
black
thick
eyebrow
,
a
pig
-
tail
wig
of
the
same
colour
,
and
a
formidable
hat
pull
over
his
forehead
,
who
stand
gnaw
his
finger
in
the
crowd
,
and
no
sooner
feel
the
application
of
my
shoe
-
heel
,
than
he
roar
out
in
a
tremendous
voice
,
"
blood
and
wound
!
<EOS>
you
son
of
a
whore
,
what
be
that
for
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
ask
pardon
with
a
great
deal
of
submission
,
and
protest
I
have
no
intention
of
hurt
him
;
but
the
more
I
humble
myself
the
more
he
storm
,
and
insist
upon
gentlemany
satisfaction
,
at
the
same
time
provoke
me
with
scandalous
name
that
I
could
not
put
up
with
;
so
that
I
give
a
loose
to
my
passion
,
return
his
billingsgate
,
and
challenge
him
to
follow
me
down
to
the
piazza
.
 
<EOS>
His
indignation
cool
as
mine
warm
<EOS>
,
he
refuse
my
invitation
,
say
,
he
would
chuse
his
own
time
,
and
return
towards
the
table
muttering
threat
,
which
I
neither
dread
nor
distinctly
hear
;
but
descend
with
great
deliberation
,
receive
my
sword
from
the
door
-
keeper
,
whom
I
gratify
with
a
guinea
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
place
,
and
go
home
in
a
rapture
of
joy
.
    
<EOS>
My
faithful
valet
,
who
have
sit
up
all
night
in
the
utmost
uneasiness
on
my
account
,
let
me
in
with
his
face
beslubbere
with
tear
,
and
follow
me
to
my
chamber
,
where
he
stand
silent
like
a
condemned
criminal
,
in
expectation
of
hear
that
every
shilling
be
spend
.
 
<EOS>
I
guess
the
situation
of
his
thought
,
and
assume
a
sullen
look
,
bid
him
fetch
me
some
water
to
wash
.
     
<EOS>
He
reply
,
without
lift
his
eye
from
the
ground
,
"
<EOS>
in
my
simple
conjecture
,
you
have
more
occasion
for
rest
,
not
have
(
I
suppose
)
sleep
these
four
and
twenty
hour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
bring
me
some
water
,
"
(
say
I
in
a
peremptory
tone
;
)
upon
which
he
sneak
away
shrug
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
before
he
return
I
have
spread
my
whole
stock
on
the
table
in
the
most
ostentatious
manner
;
so
that
when
it
first
salute
his
view

stand
like
one
intrance

and
have
rub
his
eye
more
than
once
,
to
assure
himself
of
his
be
awake
,
break
out
into
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
,
what
a
vast
treasure
be
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
all
our
own
,
Strap
,
(
say
I
)
take
what
be
necessary
,
and
redeem
the
sword
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
He
advance
towards
the
table
,
stopt
short
by
the
way
,
look
at
the
money
and
me
by
turn
,
and
with
a
wildness
in
his
countenance
,
produce
from
joy
check
by
distrust
,
cry
,
"
I
dare
say
,
it
be
honestly
come
by
.
"
<EOS>
to
remove
his
scruple
,
I
make
him
acquaint
with
the
whole
story
of
my
success
,
on
hearing
of
which
,
he
dance
about
the
room
,
in
an
exstacy
,
"
God
be
praise
!
 
<EOS>
a
white
stone
!
 
<EOS>
God
be
praise

<EOS>
a

"
<EOS>
so
that
I
be
afraid
the
sudden
change
of
fortune
have
disorder
his
intellect
,
and
that
he
be
run
mad
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
extremely
concerned
at
this
event
,
I
attempt
to
reason
him
out
of
his
frenzy
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
for
,
without
regard
what
I
say
,
he
continue
to
frisk
up
and
down
,
and
repeat
his
rhapsody
of
"
God
be
praise
!
<EOS>
a
white
stone
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
rise
in
the
utmost
consternation
,
and
lay
violent
hand
upon
him
put
a
stop
to
his
extravagance
,
by
fix
him
down
to
a
settee
that
be
in
the
room
.
     
<EOS>
this
constraint
banish
his
delirium
;
he
start
as
if
just
awoke
,
and
terrify
at
my
behaviour
,
cry
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
when
he
learn
the
cause
of
my
apprehension
,
he
be
ashamed
of
his
transport
,
and
tell
me
,
that
in
mention
the
white
stone
,
he
allude
to
the
Dies
fasti
of
the
Romans
,
alba
lapide
notati
.
    
<EOS>
have
no
inclination
to
sleep
,
I
secure
my
cash
,
dress
,
and
be
just
go
abroad
,
when
the
servant
of
the
house
tell
me
,
there
be
a
gentlewoman
at
the
door
,
who
want
to
speak
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
surprize
at
this
information
,
I
bid
Strap
shew
her
up
,
and
in
less
than
a
minute
see
a
young
woman
of
a
shabby
decay
appearance
enter
my
room
.
<EOS>
after
half
a
dozen
court'sies
,
she
begin
to
sob
,
and
tell
me
her
name
be
Gawkey
;
upon
which
I
immediately
recollect
the
feature
of
Miss
Lavement
,
who
have
be
the
first
occasion
of
my
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
have
all
the
reason
in
the
world
,
to
resent
her
treacherous
usage
of
me
,
I
be
move
at
her
distress
,
and
profess
my
sorrow
at
see
her
so
reduce
,
desire
her
to
sit
,
and
enquire
into
the
particular
of
her
situation
.
 
<EOS>
She
fall
upon
her
knee
,
and
implore
my
forgivenness
for
the
injury
she
have
do
me
,
protest
before
God
,
that
she
be
force
against
her
inclination
,
into
that
hellish
conspiracy
which
have
almost
deprive
me
of
my
life
,
by
the
intreatie
of
her
husband
,
who
have
be
afterwards
renounce
by
his
father
on
account
of
his
marriage
with
her
,
and
unable
to
support
a
family
on
his
pay
,
leave
his
wife
at
her
father
's
house
,
and
go
with
the
regiment
to
Germany
,
where
he
be
break
for
misbehaviour
at
the
battle
of
Dettingen
;
since
which
time
she
have
hear
no
tiding
of
him
.
    
<EOS>
She
then
give
me
to
understand
with
many
symptom
of
penitence
,
that
it
be
her
misfortune
to
bear
a
child
four
month
after
marriage
,
by
which
her
parent
be
so
incensed
,
that
she
be
turn
out
of
door
with
the
infant
,
that
die
soon
after
;
and
have
hitherto
subsist
in
a
miserable
indigent
manner
,
on
the
extorted
charity
of
a
few
friend
,
who
be
now
quite
tired
of
giving
;
that
not
know
where
or
how
to
support
herself
one
day
longer
,
she
have
flee
for
succour
even
to
me
,
<EOS>
who
of
all
mankind
have
the
least
cause
to
assist
her
,
rely
upon
the
generosity
of
my
disposition
,
which
,
she
hope
,
would
be
pleased
with
this
opportunity
of
avenge
itself
in
the
noblest
manner
,
on
the
wretch
who
have
wrong
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
affect
with
her
discourse
,
and
have
no
cause
to
suspect
the
sincerity
of
her
repentance
,
raise
her
up
,
freely
pardon
all
she
have
do
against
me
,
and
promise
to
befriend
her
as
much
as
lie
in
my
power
.
    
<EOS>
since
my
last
arrival
in
London
,
I
have
make
no
advance
to
the
apothecary
,
imagine
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
make
my
innocence
appear
,
so
unhappily
be
my
accusation
circumstance
:
strap
indeed
have
labour
to
justify
me
to
the
schoolmaster
;
but
so
far
from
succeed
in
his
attempt
,
Mr
Concordance
dropt
all
correspondence
with
him
,
because
he
refuse
to
quit
his
connexion
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
thing
be
in
this
situation
,
I
think
a
fair
opportunity
of
vindicate
my
character
could
not
offer
,
than
that
which
now
present
itself
;
 
therefore
stipulate
with
Mrs
Gawkey
,
that
before
I
yield
her
the
least
assistance
,
she
should
do
me
the
justice
to
clear
my
reputation
,
by
explain
upon
oath
before
a
Magistrate
,
the
whole
of
the
conspiracy
,
as
it
have
be
execute
against
me
.
     
<EOS>
when
she
have
give
me
this
satisfaction
,
I
present
her
with
five
guinea
,
a
sum
so
much
above
her
expectation
,
that
she
could
scarce
believe
the
evidence
of
her
sense
,
and
be
ready
to
worship
me
for
my
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
the
declaration
sign
with
her
own
hand
,
I
send
to
her
father
,
who
,
upon
recollect
and
compare
the
circumstance
of
my
charge
,
be
convince
of
my
integrity
,
and
wait
on
me
next
day
,
in
company
with
his
friend
the
schoolmaster
,
to
whom
he
have
communicate
my
vindication
.
 
<EOS>
after
mutual
salutation
,
Monsieur
Lavement
begin
a
long
apology
for
the
unjust
treatment
I
have
receive
;
but
I
save
him
a
good
deal
of
breath
,
by
interrupt
his
harrangue
,
and
assure
him
,
that
so
far
from
entertain
any
resentment
against
him
,
I
think
myself
oblige
to
his
lenity
,
which
allow
me
to
escape
,
after
such
strong
presumption
of
guilt
appear
against
me
.
<EOS>
Mr
Concordance
think
it
now
his
turn
to
speak
,
observe
,
that
Mr
Random
have
too
much
candour
and
sagacity
to
be
disoblige
at
their
conduct
,
which
,
all
thing
consider
,
could
not
have
be
otherwise
,
with
any
honesty
of
intention
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
(
say
he
)
if
the
plot
have
be
unravel
to
us
by
any
supernatural
intelligence
;
if
it
have
be
whisper
by
a
genie
,
communicate
by
a
dream
,
or
reveal
by
an
angel
from
on
high
,
we
should
have
be
to
blame
in
credit
ocular
demonstration
;
 
<EOS>
but
as
we
be
leave
in
the
mist
of
mortality
,
it
can
not
be
expect
we
should
be
incapable
of
imposition
.
     
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
,
Mr
Random
,
no
man
on
earth
be
more
pleased
than
I
be
at
this
triumph
of
your
character
;
and
as
the
news
of
your
misfortune
pange
me
to
the
very
intrail
,
this
manifestation
of
your
innocence
make
my
midrif
quiver
with
joy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
concern
,
desire
them
to
undeceive
those
of
their
acquaintance
who
judge
harshly
of
me
,
and
have
treat
them
with
a
glass
of
wine
,
represent
to
lavement
the
deplorable
condition
of
his
daughter
,
and
plead
her
cause
<EOS>
so
effectually
,
that
he
consent
to
settle
a
small
annuity
on
her
for
life
;
but
could
not
be
persuade
to
take
her
home
,
because
her
mother
be
so
much
incensed
that
she
would
never
see
her

chapter
LIII
<EOS>
I
purchase
new
cloath
 
reprimand
<EOS>
Strutwell
and
Straddle
 
Banter
propose
another
matrimonial
scheme
 
I
accept
of
his
term
 
set
out
for
Bath
in
a
stage
-
coach
,
with
the
young
lady
and
her
mother
 
the
behaviour
of
an
officer
and
lawyer
,
our
fellow
-
traveller
,
describe
 
a
smart
dialogue
between
my
mistress
and
the
captain
.
  
<EOS>
have
finish
this
affair
to
my
satisfaction
,
I
find
myself
perfectly
at
ease
,
and
look
upon
the
gaming
-
table
as
a
certain
resource
for
a
gentleman
in
want
,
become
more
gay
than
ever
.
     
<EOS>
although
my
cloath
be
almost
as
good
as
new
,
I
grow
ashamed
of
wear
them
,
because
I
think
every
body
,
by
this
time
,
have
get
an
inventory
of
my
wardrobe
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
I
dispose
of
a
good
part
of
my
apparel
to
a
salesman
in
Monmouth
-
street
,
for
half
the
value
,
and
buy
two
new
suit
with
the
money
.
<EOS>
I
likewise
purchase
a
plain
gold
watch
,
despairing
of
recover
that
which
I
have
so
foolishly
give
to
Strutwell
,
whom
,
notwithstanding
,
I
still
continue
to
visit
at
his
levee
,
until
the
embassador
he
have
mention
,
set
out
with
a
secretary
of
his
own
chusing
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
myself
then
at
liberty
to
expostulate
with
his
lordship
,
whom
I
treat
with
great
freedom
in
a
letter
,
for
amuse
me
with
vain
hope
,
when
he
neither
have
the
power
nor
inclination
to
provide
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
I
less
reserved
with
Straddle
,
whom
I
in
person
reproach
for
misrepresent
to
me
the
character
of
Strutwell
,
which
I
do
not
scruple
to
aver
<EOS>
be
infamous
in
every
respect
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
very
much
enrage
at
my
freedom
,
talk
a
great
deal
about
his
quality
and
honour
,
and
begin
to
make
some
comparison
which
I
think
so
injurious
to
mine
,
that
I
demand
an
explanation
with
great
warmth
;
and
he
be
mean
enough
to
equivocate
,
and
condescend
in
such
a
manner
,
that
I
leave
him
with
a
hearty
contempt
of
his
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
Banter
,
who
have
observe
a
surprizing
and
sudden
alteration
in
my
appearance
and
disposition
,
begin
to
enquire
very
minutely
into
the
cause
;
and
as
I
do
not
think
fit
to
let
him
know
the
true
state
of
the
affair
,
lest
he
may
make
free
with
my
purse
,
on
the
strength
of
have
propose
the
scheme
that
fill
it
,
I
tell
him
that
I
have
receive
a
small
supply
from
a
relation
in
the
country
,
who
at
the
same
time
have
promise
to
use
all
his
interest
(
which
be
not
small
)
in
sollicite
some
post
for
me
that
would
make
me
easy
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
the
case
(
say
Banter
)
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
not
care
to
mortify
yourself
a
little
,
in
make
your
fortune
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
relation
who
be
to
set
out
for
Bath
next
week
,
with
an
only
daughter
,
who
be
sickly
and
decrepid
,
intend
to
drink
the
water
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
,
who
be
a
rich
Turkey
merchant
,
die
about
a
year
ago
,
and
leave
her
with
a
fortune
of
twenty
thousand
pound
,
under
the
sole
management
of
her
mother
,
who
be
my
kinswoman
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
put
in
for
the
plate
myself
,
but
there
be
a
breach
at
present
between
the
old
woman
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
that
some
time
ago
I
borrow
a
small
sum
of
her
,
and
promise
,
it
seem
,
to
pay
it
before
a
certain
time
;
but
be
disappoint
in
my
expectation
of
money
from
the
country
,
<EOS>
the
day
elapse
,
without
my
be
able
to
take
up
my
note
;
upon
which
she
write
a
peremptory
letter
,
threatne
to
arrest
me
,
if
I
do
not
pay
the
debt
immediately
:
nettle
at
this
precise
behaviour
,
I
send
a
damned
severe
answer
,
which
enrage
her
so
much
,
that
she
actually
take
out
a
writ
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
find
the
thing
grow
serious
,
I
get
a
friend
to
advance
the
money
for
me
,
discharge
the
debt
,
go
to
her
house
,
and
abuse
her
for
unfriendly
deal
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
provoke
by
my
reproach
,
and
scold
in
her
turn
.
    
<EOS>
the
little
deform
urchin
join
her
mother
with
such
virulence
and
volubility
of
tongue
,
that
I
be
fain
to
make
my
retreat
,
after
have
be
honour
with
a
great
many
scandalous
epithet
,
which
give
me
plainly
to
understand
that
I
have
nothing
to
hope
from
the
esteem
of
the
one
,
or
the
affection
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
be
both
utter
stranger
to
life
,
it
be
a
thousand
to
one
that
the
girl
shall
be
pick
up
by
some
scoundrel
or
other
at
Bath
,
if
I
do
not
provide
for
her
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
well
-
look
fellow
,
Random
,
and
can
behave
as
demurely
as
a
quaker
.
 
<EOS>
now
if
you
will
give
me
an
obligation
for
five
hundred
pound
,
to
be
pay
six
month
after
your
marriage
,
I
will
put
you
in
a
method
of
carry
her
in
spite
of
all
opposition
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
too
advantageous
for
me
,
to
be
refuse
:
the
writing
be
immediately
draw
and
execute
;
and
Banter
give
me
notice
of
the
time
when
,
and
the
stage
-
coach
in
which
they
be
to
set
out
,
I
bespeak
a
place
in
the
same
convenience
;
and
have
hire
a
horse
for
Strap
,
who
be
charm
with
the
project
,
set
out
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
as
we
embark
before
day
,
I
have
not
the
pleasure
for
some
time
of
see
Miss
Snapper
<EOS>
(
that
be
the
name
of
my
mistress
)
nor
even
of
perceive
the
number
and
sex
of
my
fellow
-
traveller
,
although
I
guess
that
the
coach
be
full
,
by
the
difficulty
I
find
in
seat
myself
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
five
minute
pass
in
a
general
silence
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
the
coach
heeling
to
one
side
,
a
boisterous
voice
pronounce
,
"
to
the
right
and
leave
,
cover
your
flank
,
damme
!
"
    
<EOS>
I
easily
discover
by
the
tone
and
matter
of
this
exclamation
,
that
it
be
utter
by
a
son
of
Mars
;
neither
be
it
hard
to
conceive
the
profession
of
another
person
,
who
sit
opposite
to
me
,
and
observe

LIV
Day
breaking
,
I
have
the
pleasure
of
view
the
person
of
Miss

,
whom
I
have
not
see
before

the
soldier
be
witty
upon
me

,
talk
much
of
his
valour

reprimand
by
a
grave
gentlewoman
 
<EOS>
we
be
alarm
with
the
cry
of
highwayman
 
<EOS>
I
get
out
of
the
coach
,
and
stand
on
my
defence
 
<EOS>
they
ride
off
without
have
attack
us
 
<EOS>
I
pursue
them
 
one
of
them
be
throw
from
his
horse
and
take
 
<EOS>
I
return
to
the
coach
 
be
compliment
by
miss
Snapper
 
<EOS>
the
captain
's
behaviour
on
this
occasion
 
<EOS>
the
prude
reproach
me
in
a
soliloquy
 
<EOS>
I
upbraid
her
in
the
same
manner
 
the
behaviour
of
Mrs
Snapper
at
breakfast
,
disoblige
me
 
<EOS>
the
lawyer
be
witty
upon
the
officer
,
who
threaten
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
day
break
in
upon
us
,
discover
to
one
another
,
the
face
of
their
fellow
-
traveller
;
and
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
find
my
mistress
not
quite
so
deformed
nor
disagreeable
as
she
have
be
represent
to
me
.
     
<EOS>
Her
head
,
indeed
,
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
hatchet
,
the
edge
be
represent
by
her
face
;
but
she
have
a
certain
delicacy
in
her
complexion
,
and
a
great
deal
of
vivacity
in
her
eye
,
which
be
very
large
and
black
;
and
though
the
protuberance
of
her
breast
,
when
consider
alone
,
seem
to
drag
her
forwards
,
it
be
easy
to
perceive
an
equivalent
on
her
back
which
ballance
the
other
,
and
keep
her
body
in
equilibrio
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
I
think
I
should
have
great
reason
to
congratulate
myself
,
if
it
should
be
my
fate
to
possess
twenty
thousand
pound
encumber
with
such
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
therefore
to
deliberate
about
the
most
probable
mean
of
acquire
the
conquest
,
and
be
so
much
engross
by
this
idea
,
that
I
scarce
take
any
notice
of
the
rest
of
the
people
in
the
coach
,
but
revolve
my
prospect
in
silence
;
while
the
conversation
be
maintain
as
before
,
by
the
object
of
my
hope
,
the
son
of
Mars
,
and
the
barrister
,
who
by
this
time
have
recollect
himself
,
and
talk
in
term
as
much
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
a
dispute
happen
,
which
end
in
a
wager
,
to
be
determine
by
me
,
who
be
so
much
absorpt
in
contemplation
,
that
I
neither
hear
the
reference
nor
the
question
which
be
put
to
me
by
each
in
his
turn
;
affront
at
my
suppose
contempt
,
the
soldier
with
great
vociferation
,
swear
,
I
be
either
dumb
or
deaf
,
if
not
both
,
and
that
I
look
as
if
I
could
not
say
Boh
to
a
goose
.
 
<EOS>
arrouse
at
this
observation
,
I
fix
my
eye
upon
him
,
and
pronounce
with
emphasis
,
the
interjection
Boh
!
<EOS>
upon
which
he
cock
his
hat
in
a
fierce
manner
and
cry
,
"
Damme
,
Sir
,
what
d'ye
mean
by
that
?
"
     
<EOS>
have
I
intend
to
answer
him
,
which
by
the
bye
,
be
not
my
design
,
I
should
have
be
anticipate
by
Miss

who
tell
him
,
<EOS>
my
meaning
be
to
shew
,
that
I
could
cry
boh
!
<EOS>
to
a
goose
;
and
laugh
very
heartily
at
my
laconie
reproof
.
 
<EOS>
Her
explanation
and
mirth
do
not
help
to
appease
his
wrath
,
which
break
out
in
several
martial
insinuation
,
such
as
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
such
freedom
,
damme

D####n

Sblood
!
<EOS>
some

deserve
to
have
their
nose
pull
for
their
impertinence

"
 
<EOS>
I
think
to
have
check
these
ejaculation
by
a
frown
;
because
he
have
talk
so
much
of
his
valour
,
that
I
have
long
ago
rate
him
an
ass
with
a
lion
's
skin
;
but
so
far
from
answer
my
expectation
,
that
he
take
umbrage
at
the
contraction
of
my
brow
,
swear
he
do
not
value
<EOS>
my
sulky
look
a
fig

and
protest
he
sear
no
man
breathe

<EOS>
Miss
Snapper
say
,
she
be
very
glad
to
find
herself
in
company
with
a
man
of
so
much
courage
,
who
she
do
not

,
would
protect
us
all
from
the
attempt
of
highwayman

during

<EOS>
"

he
have
express
himself
in
this
manner
,
a
prim
gentlewoman
,
who
have
sit
silent
hitherto
,
open
her
mouth
,
and
say
,
she
wonder
how
any
man
could
be
so
rude
as
to
pull
out
such
weapon
before
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
madam
,
(
cry
the
champion
)
<EOS>
if
you
be
so
much
afraid
at
sight
of
a
pistol
,
how
dy'e
propose
to
stand
fire
if
there
should
be
occasion
?
"
     
<EOS>
She
let
him
know
,
that
if
she
think
he
could
be
so
unmannerly
as
to
use
fire
-
arm
in
her
presence
,
whatever
may
be
the
occasion
,
she
would
get
out
of
the
coach
immediately
,
and
walk
to
the
next
village
,
where
she
may
procure
a
convenience
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
could
make
any
answer
,
my
Dulcinea
interpose
,
and
observe
,
that
so
far
from
be
offend
at
a
gentleman
's
use
his
arm
in
his
own
defence
,
she
think
herself
very
lucky
in
be
along
with
one
by
whose
valour
she
stand
a
good
chance
of
save
herself
from
be
rifle
.
 
<EOS>
the
prude
cast
a
disdainful
look
at
Miss
,
and
say
,
that
people
who
have
but
little
to
lose
,
be
sometimes
the
most
solicitous
about
preserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
affront
at
this
inuendo
,
and
take
notice
,
that
people
ought
to
be
very
well
inform
before
they
speak
slightingly
of
other
people
's
fortune
,
lest
they
discover
their
own
envy
,
and
make
themselves
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
the
daughter
declare
,
that
she
do
not
pretend
to
vie
with
any
body
in
point
of
rich
;
and
if
the
lady
who
insist
upon
non
-
resistance
,
would
promise
to
indemnify
us
all
for
the
loss
we
should
sustain
;
she
should
be
one
of
the
first
to
persuade
the
captain
to
submission
,
in
case
we
should
be
attack
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
proposal
,
reasonable
as
it
be
,
the
reserved
lady
make
no
other
reply
,
than
a
scornful
glance
and
a
toss
of
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
pleased
with
the
spirit
of
my
mistress
;
and
even
wish
for
an
opportunity
of
distinguish
my
courage
under
her
eye
,
which
I
believe
,
could
not
fail
of
prepossess
her
in
my
favour
;
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
Strap
ride
up
to
the
coach
door
,
and
tell
us
in
a
great
fright
,
that
two
man
on
horse
-
back
be
cross
the
heath
(
for
by
this
time
we
have
pass
Hounslow
)
and
make
directly
towards
us
.
<EOS>
this
piece
of
information
be
no
sooner
deliver
,
than
Mrs
Snapper
begin
scream
,
her
daughter
grow
pale
,
the
other
lady
pull
out
her
purse
to
be
in
readiness
,
the
lawyer
's
tooth
chatter
,
while
he
pronounce
,
"
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
no
matter
 
we
will
sue
the
county
and
recover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
captain
give
evident
sign
of
confusion
;
and
I
,
after
have
command
the
coachman
to
stop
,
open
the
door
,
jump
out
,
and
invite
the
warrior
to
follow
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
find
him
backward
and
astonish
,
I
take
his
pistol
,
and
give
them
to
Strap
,
who
have
by
this
time
alight
,
and
tremble
very
much
,
I
mount
on
horse
-
back
;
and
take
my
own
,
(
which
I
could
better
depend
upon
)
from
the
holster
,
cock
them
both
,
and
face
the
robber
,
who
be
now
very
near
us
.
 
<EOS>
see
me
ready
to
oppose
them
on
horse
-
back
,
and
another
man
arm
a
-
foot
,
they
make
a
halt
at
some
distance
to
reconnoitre
us
,
and
after
have
ride
around
us
twice
,
myself
still
face
about
as
they
ride
,
go
off
the
same
way
they
come
,
at
a
hand
gallop
.
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
's
servant
come
up
with
a
horse
at
the
same
time
,
I
offer
him
a
crown
to
assist
me
in
pursue
them
,
which
he
no
sooner
accept
,
than
I
arm
him
with
the
officer
's
pistol
,
and
we
gallop
after
the
thief
,
who
trust
to
the
swiftness
of
their
horse
,
stop
till
we
come
within
shot
of
them
,
and
then
fire
at
us
,
put
their
nag
to
the
full
speed
.
     
<EOS>
We
follow
them
as
fast
as
our
beast
could
carry
us
,
but
not
be
so
well
mount
as
they
,
our
effort
would
have
be
to
little
purpose
,
have
not
the
horse
of
one
of
them
stumble
and
throw
his
rider
with
such
violence
over
his
head
,
that
he
lie
senseless
,
when
we
come
up
,
and
be
take
without
the
least
opposition
,
while
his
comrade
consult
his
own
safety
in
flight
,
without
regard
the
distress
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
We
scarce
have
time
to
make
ourselves
master
of
his
arm
,
and
tye
his
hand
together
,
before
he
recover
his
sense
;
when
learn
his
situation
,
he
affect
surprize
,
demand
to
know
by
what
authority
we
use
a
gentleman
in
that
manner
,
and
have
the
impudence
to
threaten
us
with
a
prosecution
for
robbery
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
we
perceive
Strap
come
up
with
a
crowd
of
people
,
arm
with
different
kind
of
weapon
;
and
among
the
rest
a
farmer
,
who
no
sooner
perceive
the
thief
,
whom
we
have
secure
,
than
he
cry
with
great
emotion
,
"
there
be
the
fellow
who
rob
me
an
hour
ago
,
of
twenty
pound
,
in
a
canvas
bag
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
search
,
and
the
money
find
exactly
as
it
have
be
describe
:
upon
which
,
we
commit
him
to
the
charge
of
the
countryman
,
who
guard
him
to
the
town
of
Hounslow
,
which
it
seem
the
farmer
have
alarm
;
and
have
satisfy
the
footman
for
his
trouble
accord
to
promise
,
return
with
Strap
to
the
coach
,
where
I
find
the
captain
and
lawyer
busy
in
administre
smell
bottle
and
cordial
to
the
grave
lady
,
who
have
go
into
a
fit
at
the
noise
of
the
firing
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
have
take
my
seat
,
Miss
Snapper
,
who
from
the
coach
have
see
every
thing
that
happen
,
make
me
a
compliment
on
my
behaviour
,
and
say
,
she
be
glad
to
see
me
return
,
without
have
receive
any
injury
;
her
mother
too
own
herself
oblige
to
my
resolution
;
and
the
lawyer
tell
me
,
that
I
be
intitle
by
act
of
parliament
to
a
reward
of
forty
pound
,
for
have
apprehend
a
highwayman
.
     
<EOS>
the
soldier
observe
,
with
a
countenance
in
which
impudence
and
shame
struggling
,
produce
some
disorder
,
that
if
I
have
not
be
in
such
a
damned
hurry
to
get
out
of
the
coach
,
he
would
have
secure
the
rogue
effectually
,
without
all
this
bustle
and
loss
of
time
,
by
a
scheme
which
my
heat
and
precipitation
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
my
own
part
,
(
continue
he
)
<EOS>
I
be
always
extremely
cool
on
these
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
it
appear
,
by
your
trembling

(
say
the
young
lady
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
death
and
damnation
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
your
sex
protect
you
,
madam
;
if
any
man
on
earth
durst
tell
me
so
much
,
I
would
send
him
to
hell
,
d####n
my
heart
!
<EOS>
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
fix
his
eye
on
me
,
and
ask
if
I
have
see
him
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
without
hesitation
,
"
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
Sir
,
(
say
he
)
d'ye
<EOS>
doubt
my
courage
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
,
"
very
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
declaration
quite
disconcert
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
blank
,
and
pronounce
with
a
faultere
voice
,
"
o
!
'
<EOS>
tis
very
well
 
<EOS>
d####n
<EOS>
my
blood
!
<EOS>
I
shall
find
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
signify
my
contempt
of
him
,
by
thrust
my
tongue
in
my
cheek
,
which
humble
him
so
much
,
that
he
scarce
swear
another
oath
during
the
whole
journey
.
    
<EOS>
the
precise
lady
,
have
recruit
her
spirit
by
the
help
of
some
strong
water
,
begin
a
soliloquy
,
in
which
she
wonder
that
any
man
,
who
pretend
to
maintain
the
character
of
a
gentleman
,
could
,
for
the
sake
of
a
little
paultry
coin
,
throw
person
of
honour
into
such
quandary
as
may
endanger
their
life
;
and
profess
her
surprize
,
that
woman
be
not
ashamed
to
commend
such
brutality
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
vow
,
that
for
the
future
she
would
never
set
foot
in
a
stage
-
coach
,
if
a
private
convenience
could
be
have
for
love
or
money
.
    
<EOS>
Nettled
at
her
remark
<EOS>
,
I
take
the
same
method
of
convey
my
sentiment
,
and
wonder
in
my
turn
,
that
any
woman
of
common
sense
,
should
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
that
people
who
have
neither
acquaintance
nor
connexion
with
her
,
would
tamely
allow
themselves
to
be
rob
and
mal
-
treat
,
merely
to
indulge
her
capricious
humour
.
<EOS>
I
likewise
confess
my
astonishment
at
her
insolence
and
ingratitude
in
tax
a
person
with
brutality
,
who
deserve
her
approbation
and
acknowledgment
;
and
vow
,
that
if
ever
we
should
be
assault
again
,
I
would
leave
her
to
the
mercy
of
the
spoiler
,
that
she
may
know
the
value
of
my
protection
.
    
<EOS>
this
person
of
honour
do
not
think
fit
to
carry
on
the
altercation
any
further
,
but
seem
to
chew
the
cud
of
her
resentment
,
with
the
crest
-
fall
captain
,
while
I
enter
into
discourse
with
mu
charmer
,
who
be
the
more
pleased
with
my
conversation
,
as
she
have
conceive
a
very
indifferent
opinion
of
my
intellect
from
my
former
silence
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
have
cause
to
be
equally
satisfied
with
the
sprightliness
of
her
genius
,
could
she
have
curb
her
imagination
with
judgment
;
but
she
labour
under
such
a
profusion
of
talk
,
that
I
dread
her
unruly
tongue
,
and
feel
by
anticipation
the
horror
of
an
eternal
clack
!
<EOS>
however
,
when
I
consider
on
the
other
hand
,
the
joy
attend
the
possession
of
twenty
thousand
pound
,
I
forget
her
imperfection
,
seize
occasion
by
the
fore
-
lock
,
and
endeavour
to
insinuate
myself
into
her
affection
.
     
<EOS>
the
careful
mother
keep
a
strict
watch
over
her
,
and
though
she
could
not
help
behave
civilly
to
me
,
take
frequent
opportunity
of
discourage
our
communication
,
by
reprimand
her
for
be
so
free
with
stranger
,
and
tell
her
she
must
learn
to
speak
less
,
and
think
more
.
 
<EOS>
abridge
of
the
use
of
speech
,
we
converse
with
our
eye
,
and
I
find
the
young
lady
very
eloquent
in
this
kind
of
discourse
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
reason
to
believe
,
that
she
be
sick
of
the
old
gentlewoman
's
tuition
,
and
that
I
should
find
it
no
difficult
matter
to
supersede
her
authority
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
the
place
where
we
be
to
breakfast
,
I
alight
and
help
my
mistress
out
of
the
coach
,
as
well
as
her
mother
,
who
call
for
a
private
room
,
to
which
they
withdraw
,
in
order
to
eat
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
retire
together
,
I
perceive
that
Miss
have
get
more
twist
from
nature
,
than
I
have
before
observe
,
be
bent
sideway
into
the
figure
of
an
s
,
so
that
her
progression
very
much
resemble
that
of
a
crab
.
 
<EOS>
the
prude
also
choose
the
captain
for
her
mess
-
mate
,
and
order
breakfast
for
two
only
to
be
bring
into
another
separate
room
;
while
the
lawyer
and
I
,
desert
by
the
rest
of
the
company
,
be
say
to
put
up
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
good
deal
chagrin
at
the
stately
reserve
of
Mrs
Snapper
,
who
I
think
do
not
use
me
with
all
the
complaisance
I
deserve
;
and
my
companion
declare
,
that
he
have
be
a
traveller
these
twenty
year
,
and
never
know
the
stage
-
coach
rule
so
much
infringe
before
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
honourable
gentlewoman
,
I
could
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
her
attachment
to
the
lieutenant
;
and
ask
the
lawyer
if
he
know
for
which
of
the
soldier
's
virtue
she
admire
him
?
<EOS>
the
counsellor
facetiously
reply
,
"
I
suppose
the
lady
know
him
to
be
an
able
conveyancer
,
and
want
him
to
make
a
settlement
intail
.
"
     
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
laugh
at
the
archness
of
the
barrister
,
who
entertain
me
during
breakfast
,
with
a
great
deal
of
wit
of
the
same
kind
,
at
the
expence
of
our
fellow
-
traveller
;
and
among
other
thing
say
,
he
be
sorry
to
find
the
young
lady
saddle
with
such
incumbrance
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
have
make
an
end
of
our
repast
,
and
pay
our
reckoning
,
we
go
into
the
coach
,
take
our
place
,
and
bribe
the
driver
with
six
-
pence
,
to
revenge
us
on
the
rest
of
his
fare
,
by
hurry
them
away
in
the
midst
of
their
meal
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
perform
to
our
satisfaction
,
after
he
have
disturb
their
enjoyment
with
his
importunate
clamour
.
 
<EOS>
the
mother
and
daughter
obey
the
summon
first
,
and
come
to
the
coach
-
door
,
be
oblige
to
desire
the
coachman
's
assistance
to
get
in
,
because
the
lawyer
and
I
have
agree
to
shew
our
resentment
by
our
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
no
sooner
seat
,
than
the
captain
appear
as
much
heat
as
if
he
have
be
pursue
a
dozen
of
mile
by
an
enemy
;
and
immediately
after
him
come
the
lady
,
not
without
some
mark
of
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
have
help
her
up
,
he
enter
himself
,
growl
a
few
oath
against
the
coachman
for
his
impertinent
interruption
;
and
the
lawyer
comfort
him
,
by
say
,
that
if
he
have
suffer
a
nisi
prius
through
the
obstinacy
of
the
defendant
,
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
join
issue
at
the
next
stage
.
<EOS>
this
last
expression
give
offence
to
the
grave
gentlewoman
,
who
tell
him
,
if
she
be
a
man
,
she
would
make
him
repent
of
such
obscenity
,
and
thank
God
she
have
never
be
in
such
company
before
.
     
<EOS>
at
this
insinuation
,
the
captain
think
himself
under
a
necessity
of
espouse
the
lady
's
cause
;
and
accordingly
threaten
to
cut
the
lawyer
's
ear
out
of
his
head
,
if
he
should
give
his
tongue
any
such
liberty
for
the
future
.

chapter
LV
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
ingratiate
myself
with
the
mother
,
and
be
favour
by
accident
 
<EOS>
the
precise
lady
find
her
husband
,
and
quit
the
coach
 
<EOS>
the
captain
be
disappointed
of
his
dinner
 
<EOS>
we
arrive
at
Bath
 
<EOS>
I
accompany
Miss
Snapper
to
the
long
room
,
where
she
be
attack
by
beau
N####h
,
and
turn
the
laugh
against
him
 
<EOS>
I
make
love
to
her
,
and
receive
a
check
 
<EOS>
I
squire
her
to
an
assembly
,
where
I
be
bless
with
a
sight
of
my
dear
Narcissa
,
which
discompose
me
so
much
,
that
Miss
Snapper
observe
my
disorder
,
be
at
pain
to
discover
the
cause
 
be
picque
at
the
occasion
,
and
in
our
way
home
,
pay
me
a
sarcastic
compliment
 
<EOS>
I
be
meet
by
Miss
Williams
,
who
be
maid
and
confidante
of
Narcissa
 
<EOS>
she
acquaint
me
with
her
lady
's
regard
for
me
while
under
the
disguise
of
a
servant
,
and
describe
the
transport
of
Narcissa
on
see
me
at
the
assembly
,
in
the
character
of
a
gentleman
 
<EOS>
I
be
surprize
with
an
account
of
her
aunt
's
marriage
,
and
make
an
appointment
to
meet
Miss
Williams
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
unsocial
interval
,
my
pride
and
interest
maintain
a
severe
conflict
,
on
the
subject
of
Miss
Snaper
,
whom
the
one
represent
as
unworthy
of
my
notice
,
and
the
other
propose
as
the
object
of
my
whole
attention
:
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
attend
such
a
match
,
be
oppose
to
one
another
by
my
imagination
;
and
at
length
,
my
judgment
give
it
so
much
in
favour
of
the
first
,
that
I
resolve
to
prosecute
my
scheme
,
with
all
the
address
in
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
perceive
some
concern
in
her
countenance
,
occasion
by
my
silence
,
which
she
no
doubt
impute
to
my
disgust
at
her
mother
's
behaviour
;
and
<EOS>
as
I
believe
the
old
woman
could
not
fail
of
ascribe
my
muteness
to
the
same
motive
,
I
determine
to
continue
that
sullen
conduct
towards
her
,
and
fall
upon
some
other
method
of
manifest
my
esteem
for
the
daughter
;
nor
be
it
difficult
for
me
to
make
her
acquaint
with
my
sentiment
by
the
expression
of
my
look
,
which
I
model
into
the
character
of
humility
and
love
;
and
which
be
answer
by
her
with
all
the
sympathy
and
approbation
I
could
desire
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
begin
to
consider
,
that
without
further
opportunity
of
improve
my
success
,
all
the
progress
I
have
hitherto
make
could
not
much
avail
,
and
that
such
opportunity
could
not
be
enjoy
without
the
mother
's
permission
;
I
conclude
it
would
be
requisite
to
vanquish
her
coldness
and
suspicion
by
my
assiduity
and
respectful
behaviour
on
the
road
;
and
she
would
in
all
likelihood
invite
me
to
visit
her
at
Bath
,
where
I
do
not
fear
of
be
able
to
cultivate
her
acquaintance
as
much
as
would
be
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
my
purpose
.
     
<EOS>
and
indeed
accident
furnish
me
with
an
opportunity
of
oblige
her
so
much
,
that
she
could
not
with
any
appearance
of
good
manner
,
forbear
to
gratify
my
inclination
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
our
dining
-
place
,
we
find
all
the
eatable
in
the
inn
bespoke
by
a
certain
nobleman
,
who
have
get
the
start
of
us
;
and
in
all
likelihood
,
my
mistress
and
her
mother
must
have
dine
with
Duke
Humphrey
,
have
I
not
exert
myself
in
their
behalf
,
and
bribe
the
landlord
with
a
glass
of
wine
to
curtail
his
lordship
's
entertainment
of
a
couple
of
fowl
and
some
bacon
,
which
I
send
with
my
compliment
to
the
lady
;
they
accept
my
treat
with
a
great
many
thank
,
and
desire
I
would
favour
them
with
my
company
at
dinner
,
where
I
amuse
the
old
gentlewoman
so
successfully
,
by
maintain
a
seemingly
disintereste
ease
,
in
the
midst
of
my
civility
,
that
she
signify
a
desire
of
be
better
acquaint
,
and
hope
I
would
be
so
kind
as
to
see
her
sometimes
at
Bath
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
enjoy
myself
in
this
manner
,
the
precise
lady
have
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
her
husband
,
who
be
no
other
than
gentleman
,
or
in
other
word
,
valet
de
chambre
to
the
very
nobleman
,
whose
coach
stand
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
proud
of
the
interest
she
have
in
the
house
,
she
affect
to
shew
her
power
by
introduce
the
captain
to
her
spouse
,
as
a
person
who
have
treat
her
with
great
civility
;
upon
which
he
be
invite
to
a
share
of
their
dinner
;
while
the
poor
lawyer
,
find
himself
utterly
abandon
,
make
application
to
me
,
and
be
,
through
my
intercession
,
admit
into
our
company
.
     
<EOS>
have
satisfy
our
appetite
,
and
make
ourselves
very
merry
at
the
expence
of
the
person
of
honour
,
the
civil
captain
,
and
complaisant
husband
,
I
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
discharge
the
bill
by
stealth
,
for
which
I
receive
a
great
many
apology
and
acknowledgment
from
my
guest
,
and
we
reimbarke
at
the
first
warning
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
be
oblige
,
at
last
,
to
appease
his
hunger
with
a
luncheon
of
bread
and
cheese
,
and
a
pint
bottle
of
brandy
,
which
he
dispatch
in
the
coach
,
curse
the
inappetence
of
his
lordship
,
who
have
order
dinner
to
be
put
back
a
whole
hour
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
remarkable
happen
during
the
remain
part
of
our
journey
,
which
be
end
about
twelve
a
-
clock
,
when
I
wait
on
the
lady
to
the
house
of
a
relation
,
in
which
they
intend
to
lodge
,
and
pass
that
night
at
the
inn
,
take
lodging
next
morning
for
myself
.
    
<EOS>
the
forenoon
be
spend
in
visit
every
thing
that
be
worth
see
in
the
place
,
which
I
do
in
company
with
a
gentleman
to
whom
Banter
have
give
me
a
letter
of
introduction
;
and
in
the
afternoon
I
wait
on
the
lady
,
and
find
Miss
a
good
deal
indispose
with
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
foresaw
they
would
have
occasion
for
a
male
acquaintance
to
squire
them
at
all
publick
place
,
I
be
receive
with
great
cordiality
,
and
have
the
mother
's
permission
to
conduct
them
next
day
to
the
long
room
,
which
we
no
sooner
enter
,
than
the
eye
of
every
body
present
be
turn
upon
us
;
and
when
we
have
suffer
the
martyrdom
of
their
look
for
some
time
,
a
whisper
circulate
at
our
expence
,
which
be
accompany
with
many
contemptuous
smile
,
and
titter
observation
,
to
my
utter
shame
and
confusion
.
     
<EOS>
I
do
not
<EOS>
so
much
conduct
as
follow
my
charge
to
a
place
where
she
seat
her
mother
and
herself
with
astonishing
composure
,
notwithstanding
the
unmannerly
behaviour
of
the
whole
company
,
which
seem
to
be
assume
merely
to
put
her
out
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
the
celebrated
Mr
N####h
,
who
commonly
attend
in
this
place
,
as
master
of
the
ceremony
,
perceive
the
disposition
of
the
assembly
,
take
upon
himself
the
task
of
gratify
their
ill
-
nature
still
further
,
by
expose
my
mistress
to
the
edge
of
his
wit
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
approach
us
,
with
many
bow
and
grimace
,
and
after
have
welcome
Miss
Snapper
to
the
place
,
ask
her
,
in
the
hearing
of
all
present
,
if
she
could
inform
him
of
the
name
of
Tobit
's
dog
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
incensed
at
his
insolence
,
that
I
should
certainly
have
kick
him
where
he
stand
,
without
ceremony
,
have
not
the
young
lady
prevent
the
effect
of
my
indignation
,
by
reply
with
the
utmost
vivacity
,
"
<EOS>
His
name
be
N####sh
,
and
an
impudent
dog
he
be
.
"
<EOS>
this
repartee
,
so
unexpected
and
just
,
raise
such
an
universal
laugh
at
the
aggressor
,
that
all
his
assurance
be
insufficient
to
support
him
under
their
derision
;
so
that
after
he
have
endeavour
to
compose
himself
,
by
take
snuff
,
and
force
a
smile
,
he
be
oblige
to
sneak
off
in
a
very
ludicrous
attitude
;
while
my
Dulcinea
be
applaud
to
the
sky
,
for
the
brilliancy
of
her
wit
,
and
her
acquaintance
immediately
court
by
the
good
people
of
both
sex
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
this
event
,
with
which
I
be
infinitely
pleased
at
first
,
do
not
fail
of
alarm
me
,
upon
further
reflection
,
when
I
consider
that
the
more
she
be
caress
by
person
of
distinction
,
the
more
her
pride
would
be
inflame
,
and
consequently
,
the
obstacle
to
my
success
multiply
and
enlarge
.
     
<EOS>
nor
be
my
presaging
fear
untrue
 
<EOS>
that
very
night
I
perceive
her
a
little
intoxicated
with
the
incense
she
have
receive
,
and
though
she
still
behave
with
a
particular
civility
to
me
,
I
foresee
that
as
soon
as
her
fortune
should
be
know
,
she
would
be
surround
with
a
swarm
of
admirer
,
some
one
of
whom
may
possibly
,
by
excel
me
in
point
of
wealth
,
or
in
the
art
of
flattery
and
scandal
,
supplant
me
in
her
esteem
,
and
find
mean
to
make
the
mother
of
his
party
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolve
therefore
to
lose
no
time
,
and
be
invite
to
spend
the
evening
with
them
,
find
an
opportunity
,
in
spite
of
the
old
gentlewoman
's
vigilance
,
to
explain
the
meaning
of
my
glance
in
the
coach
,
by
pay
homage
to
her
wit
,
and
profess
myself
enamour
of
her
person
.
 
<EOS>
She
blush
at
my
declaration
,
and
in
a
favourable
manner
disapprove
of
the
liberty
I
have
take
,
put
me
in
mind
of
our
be
stranger
to
one
another
,
and
desire
I
would
not
be
the
mean
of
interrupt
our
acquaintance
,
by
any
such
unseasonable
stroke
of
gallantry
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
My
ardour
be
effectually
check
by
this
reprimand
,
<EOS>
which
be
,
however
,
deliver
in
such
a
gentle
manner
,
that
I
have
no
cause
to
be
disoblige
;
and
the
arrival
of
her
mother
relieve
me
from
a
dilemma
in
which
I
should
not
have
know
how
to
demean
myself
a
minute
longer
.
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
could
I
resume
the
easiness
of
carriage
with
which
I
come
in
,
my
mistress
act
on
the
reserve
,
and
the
conversation
begin
to
flag
,
the
old
lady
introduce
her
kinswoman
of
the
house
,
and
propose
a
hand
at
whist
.
    
<EOS>
while
we
amuse
ourselves
at
this
diversion
,
I
understand
from
the
gentlewoman
,
that
there
be
to
be
an
assembly
next
night
,
at
which
I
beg
to
have
the
honour
of
dance
with
Mississippi
    
<EOS>
She
thank
me
for
the
favour
I
intend
her
,
assure
me
<EOS>
,
she
never
do
dance
,
but
signify
a
desire
of
see
the
company
;
upon
which
I
offer
my
service
,
and
be
accept
;
not
a
little
proud
of
be
exempt
from
appear
with
her
,
in
a
situation
,
that
,
notwithstanding
my
profession
to
the
contrary
,
be
not
at
all
agreeable
to
my
inclination
.
    
<EOS>
have
sup
,
and
continue
the
game
,
till
such
time
as
the
successive
yawn
of
the
mother
warn
me
to
begone
,
I
take
my
leave
,
and
go
home
,
where
I
make
Strap
very
happy
with
an
account
of
my
progress
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
put
on
my
gay
apparel
,
and
go
to
drink
tea
at
Mrs
Snapper
's
,
accord
to
appointment
,
when
I
find
,
to
my
inexpressible
satisfaction
,
that
she
be
lay
up
with
the
tooth
-
ach
,
and
that
Miss
be
to
be
intrust
to
my
care
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
set
out
for
the
ball
-
room
,
pretty
early
in
the
evening
,
and
take
possession
of
a
commedious
place
,
where
we
have
not
sit
longer
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
a
gentleman
dress
in
a
green
frock
come
in
,
lead
a
young
lady
,
whom
I
immediately
discover
to
be
the
adorable
Narcissa
!
<EOS>
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
thrilling
of
my
soul
at
that
instant
!
<EOS>
my
reflection
be
overwhelm
with
a
torrent
of
agitation
!
<EOS>
my
heart
throb
with
surprizing
violence
!
<EOS>
a
sudden
mist
overspread
my
eye
!
<EOS>
my
ear
be
invade
with
a
dreadful
sound
!
<EOS>
I
pant
for
want
of
breath
,
and
in
short
,
be
for
some
moment
intrance
!
 
<EOS>
this
first
tumult
subsiding
,
a
crowd
of
flattering
idea
rush
upon
my
imagination
:
    
<EOS>
every
thing
that
be
soft
,
sensible
,
and
engage
in
the
character
of
that
dear
creature
,
recur
to
my
remembrance
,
and
every
favourable
circumstance
of
my
own
qualification
appear
in
all
the
aggravation
of
self
-
conceit
,
to
heighten
my
expectation
!
 
<EOS>
neither
be
this
transport
of
long
duration
:
<EOS>
the
dread
of
her
be
already
dispose
of
,
intervene
,
and
over
-
cast
my
enchanting
reverie
!
<EOS>
My
presaging
apprehension
represent
her
encircle
in
the
arm
of
some
happy
rival
,
and
of
consequence
for
ever
lose
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
be
sting
with
this
suggestion
,
and
believe
the
person
who
conduct
her
,
to
be
the
husband
of
this
amiable
young
lady
,
already
devote
him
to
my
fury
,
and
stand
up
to
mark
him
for
my
vengeance
;
when
I
recollect
,
to
my
unspeakable
joy
,
her
brother
the
fox
-
hunter
,
in
the
person
of
her
gallant
.
 
<EOS>
undeceived
so
much
to
my
satisfaction
in
this
particular
,
I
gaze
in
a
frenzy
of
delight
,
on
the
irresistible
charm
of
his
sister
,
who
no
sooner
distinguish
me
in
the
crowd
,
than
her
evident
confusion
afford
a
happy
oman
to
my
flame
.
 
<EOS>
at
sight
of
me
she
start
,
the
rose
instantly
vanish
from
her
polished
cheek
,
and
return
in
a
moment
with
a
double
glow
that
over
-
spread
her
lovely
neck
,
while
her
enchant
bosom
heave
with
strong
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
I
hail
these
favourable
symptom
,
and
lie
in
wait
for
her
look
,
I
do
homage
with
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
approve
my
declaration
,
by
the
complacency
of
her
aspect
;
and
I
be
so
transported
with
the
discovery
,
that
more
than
once
,
I
be
on
the
point
of
make
up
to
her
,
and
disclose
the
throbbing
of
my
heart
in
person
,
have
not
that
profound
veneration
which
her
presence
always
inspire
,
restrain
the
unseasonable
impulse
.
     
<EOS>
My
whole
power
be
engross
in
this
manner
,
it
may
be
easily
imagine
how
ill
I
entertain
Miss
Snapper
,
on
whom
I
could
not
now
turn
my
eye
,
without
make
comparison
very
little
to
her
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
even
in
my
power
to
return
distinct
answer
to
the
question
she
ask
from
time
to
time
,
so
that
she
could
not
help
observe
my
absence
of
behaviour
;
and
have
a
turn
,
for
observation
,
watch
my
glance
,
and
trace
them
to
the
divine
object
,
discover
the
cause
of
my
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
may
,
however
,
be
convince
of
the
truth
of
her
conjecture
,
she
begin
to
interrogate
me
with
regard
to
Narcissa
,
and
notwithstanding
all
my
endeavour
to
disguise
my
sentiment
,
perceive
my
attachment
by
my
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
,
she
assume
a
stateliness
of
behaviour
,
and
sit
silent
during
the
remain
part
of
the
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
other
time
I
should
have
be
prodigiously
alarm
at
her
suspicion
,
but
at
that
instant
,
I
be
elevate
by
my
passion
above
every
other
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
the
mistress
of
my
soul
have
retire
with
her
brother
,
I
discover
so
much
uneasiness
at
my
situation
,
that
Miss
Snapper
propose
to
go
home
;
and
<EOS>
while
I
conduct
her
to
a
chair
,
tell
me
she
have
too
great
a
regard
for
me
to
keep
me
any
longer
in
torment
.
 
<EOS>
I
feign
ignorance
of
her
meaning
,
and
have
see
her
safely
at
her
lodging
,
take
my
leave
,
and
go
home
in
an
exstasy
;
where
I
disclose
every
thing
that
have
happen
to
my
confident
and
humble
servant
Strap
,
who
do
not
relish
the
accident
so
well
as
I
expect
;
and
observe
,
that
a
bird
in
hand
be
worth
two
in
the
bush
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
however
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
know
good
 
you
know
best

"
 
<EOS>
next
day
as
I
go
to
the
Bath
,
in
hope
of
see
or
hear
some
tiding
of
my
fair
enslaver
,
I
be
meet
by
a
gentlewoman
,
who
have
look
hard
at
me
,
cry
,
"
o
Christ
!
<EOS>
Mr
Random
!
"
<EOS>
surprise
at
this
exclamation
,
I
examine
the
countenance
of
the
person
who
speak
,
and
immediately
recognize
my
old
sweet
-
heart
and
fellow
-
sufferer
Miss
Williams
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
mightily
pleased
to
find
this
unfortunate
woman
under
such
a
decent
appearance
,
profess
my
joy
at
see
her
well
,
and
desire
to
know
where
I
should
have
the
pleasure
of
her
conversation
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
heartily
rejoice
at
the
apparent
easiness
of
my
fortune
,
and
give
me
to
know
that
she
,
as
yet
,
have
no
habitation
that
she
could
properly
call
her
own
;
but
would
wait
on
me
at
any
place
I
would
please
to
appoint
 
understanding
that
she
be
disengage
for
the
present
,
I
shew
her
the
way
to
my
own
lodging
,
where
,
after
a
very
affectionate
salutation
,
she
inform
me
of
her
be
very
happy
in
the
service
of
a
young
lady
,
to
whom
she
be
recommend
by
a
former
mistress
deceased
,
into
whose
family
she
have
introduce
herself
by
the
honest
deceit
she
have
concert
,
while
she
live
with
me
in
the
garret
at
London
 
<EOS>
She
then
express
a
vehement
desire
to
be
acquaint
with
the
vicissitude
of
my
life
since
we
part
,
and
ascribe
her
curiosity
to
the
concern
she
have
for
my
interest
 
<EOS>
I
forthwith
<EOS>
gratify
her
request
,
and
when
I
describe
my
situation
in
Sussex
,
perceive
her
to
attend
to
my
story
with
particular
eagerness
.
    
<EOS>
She
interrupt
me
when
I
have
finish
that
period
,
with
"
good
God
!
<EOS>
be
it
possible
,
"
 
and
then
beg
I
would
be
so
good
as
to
continue
my
relation
;
which
I
do
as
briefly
as
I
could
,
burn
with
impatience
to
know
the
cause
of
her
surprize
,
about
which
I
have
already
form
a
very
interesting
conjecture
 
have
therefore
bring
my
adventure
down
to
the
present
day
<EOS>
,
she
seem
very
much
affect
with
the
different
circumstance
of
my
fortune
;
and
say
with
a
smile
,
she
believe
my
distress
be
now
at
a
period
,
proceed
to
inform
me
,
that
the
lady
whom
she
serve
be
no
other
than
the
charming
Narcissa
,
who
have
honour
her
with
her
confidence
for
some
time
,
 
that
in
consequence
of
that
trust
,
she
have
often
repeat
the
story
of
John
Brown
,
with
great
admiration
and
regard
;
that
she
love
to
dwell
upon
the
particular
of
his
character
,
and
do
not
scruple
to
own
a
tender
approbation
of
his
flame
 
<EOS>
I
become
delirious
with
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
strain
Miss
Williams
in
my
embrace
,
call
her
the
angel
of
my
happiness
,
and
act
such
extravagancy
,
that
she
would
have
be
convince
of
my
sincerity
,
<EOS>
have
not
my
honour
be
clear
enough
to
her
before
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
in
a
condition
to
yield
attention
,
she
describe
the
present
situation
of
her
mistress
,
who
have
no
sooner
come
home
the
night
before
,
than
she
closet
her
,
and
in
a
rapture
of
joy
,
give
her
to
know
that
she
have
see
me
at
the
ball
,
where
I
appear
in
the
character
which
she
always
think
my
due
,
with
such
advantage
of
transformation
,
that
unless
my
image
have
be
engraven
on
her
heart
,
it
would
have
be
impossible
to
know
me
for
the
person
who
have
wear
her
aunt
's
livery
;
 
that
by
the
language
of
my
eye
,
she
be
assure
of
the
continuance
of
my
passion
for
her
,
and
consequently
of
my
be
unengage
to
any
other
;
and
that
though
she
do
not
doubt
,
I
would
speedily
fall
upon
some
method
of
be
introduce
,
she
be
so
impatient
to
hear
of
me
,
that
she
(
Miss
Williams
)
have
be
send
abroad
this
very
morning
,
on
purpose
to
learn
tiding
of
the
name
and
character
I
at
present
bore
.
     
<EOS>
My
bosom
have
be
hitherto
a
stranger
to
such
a
flood
of
joy
as
now
rush
upon
it
:
My
faculty
be
overborn
by
the
tide
:
It
be
some
time
,
before
I
could
open
my
mouth
;
and
much
longer
'
ere
<EOS>
I
could
utter
a
coherent
sentence
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
I
fervently
request
her
to
lead
me
immediately
to
the
object
of
my
adoration
:
but
she
resist
my
importunity
,
and
explain
the
danger
of
such
premature
conduct
 
<EOS>
"
how
favourable
soever
<EOS>
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
my
lady
's
inclination
towards
you
may
be
,
this
you
may
depend
upon
,
that
she
will
not
commit
the
small
trespass
on
decorum
,
either
in
disclose
her
own
,
or
in
receive
a
declaration
of
your
passion
:
and
altho
'
the
great
veneration
I
have
for
you
,
have
prompt
me
to
reveal
what
she
communicate
to
me
in
confidence
,
I
know
<EOS>
so
well
the
severity
of
her
sentiment
with
respect
to
the
punctilio
of
her
sex
<EOS>
,
that
,
if
she
should
learn
the
least
surmise
of
it
,
she
would
not
only
dismiss
me
as
a
wretch
unworthy
of
her
benevolence
,
but
also
for
ever
shun
the
effort
of
your
love
<EOS>
"
 
I
assent
to
the
justness
of
her
remonstrance
,
and
desire
she
would
assist
me
with
her
advice
and
direction
:
upon
which
,
it
be
concert
between
us
,
that
for
the
present
,
I
should
be
content
with
her
tell
Narcissa
that
in
the
course
of
her
inquiry
,
she
could
only
learn
my
name
:
and
that
if
in
a
day
or
two
,
I
could
fall
upon
no
other
method
of
be
make
acquainted
,
she
would
deliver
a
letter
from
me
,
on
pretence
of
consult
her
happiness
;
and
say
that
I
meet
her
in
the
street
,
and
bribe
her
to
that
piece
of
service
.
     
<EOS>
Matters
be
thus
adjust
,
I
keep
my
old
acquaintance
to
breakfast
,
and
learn
from
her
conversation
,
that
my
rival
Sir
Timothy
have
drink
himself
into
an
apoplexy
,
of
which
he
die
five
month
ago
,
that
the
savage
be
still
unmarried
,
and
that
his
aunt
have
be
seize
with
a
whim
which
he
little
expect
,
and
choose
the
school
-
master
of
the
parish
for
her
lord
and
husband
:
but
matrimony
not
agree
with
her
constitution
,
she
have
be
hectick
and
dropsical
a
good
while
,
and
be
now
at
Bath
in
order
to
drink
the
water
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
;
that
her
niece
have
accompany
her
thither
at
her
request
,
and
attend
her
with
the
same
affection
as
before
,
notwithstanding
the
faux
pas
she
have
commit
:
and
that
her
nephew
who
have
be
exasperate
at
the
loss
of
her
fortune
,
do
not
give
his
attendance
out
of
good
will
,
but
purely
to
have
an
eye
on
his
sister
,
lest
she
should
likewise
throw
herself
away
,
without
his
consent
or
approbation
.
 
<EOS>
have
enjoy
ourselves
in
this
manner
,
and
make
an
assignation
to
meet
next
day
at
a
certain
place
,
Miss
Williams
take
her
leave
;
and
Strap
's
look
be
very
inquisitive
about
the
nature
of
the
communication
subsist
between
us
,
I
make
him
acquaint
with
the
whole
affair
,
to
his
great
astonishment
and
satisfaction

CHAPTER
LVI
<EOS>
I
become
acquainted
with
Narcissa
's
brother
who
invite
me
to
his
house
 
where
I
be
introduce
to
that
adorable
creature
 
after
dinner
,
the
squire
retire
to
take
his
nap
 
Freeman
,
guess
the
situation
of
my
thought
,
withdraw
likewise
on
pretence
of
business
 
<EOS>
I
declare
my
passion
for
Narcissa
 
be
well
receive
 
<EOS>
charm
with
her
conversation
 
<EOS>
the
squire
detain
us
to
supper
 
<EOS>
I
elude
his
design
by
a
stratagem
,
and
get
home
sober
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
I
drink
tea
at
the
house
of
Mr
Freeman
,
to
whom
I
have
be
recommend
by
Banter
;
where
I
have
not
sit
five
minute
,
 
'
till
the
fox
-
hunter
come
in
,
and
by
his
familiar
behaviour
,
appear
to
be
intimate
with
my
friend
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
at
first
,
under
some
concern
,
lest
he
should
recollect
my
feature
;
but
when
I
find
myself
introduce
to
him
as
a
gentleman
from
London
,
without
be
discover
,
I
bless
the
opportunity
that
bring
me
into
his
company
;
hope
,
that
in
the
course
of
our
acquaintance
,
he
would
invite
me
to
his
house
 
nor
be
my
hope
frustrated
,
for
as
we
spend
the
evening
together
<EOS>
,
he
grow
extremely
fond
of
my
conversation
,
ask
a
great
many
childish
question
about
France
and
foreign
part
;
and
seem
so
highly
entertained
with
my
answer
,
that
in
his
cup
,
he
shake
me
often
by
the
hand
,
pronounce
me
an
honest
fellow
,
and
in
fine
,
desire
our
company
at
dinner
next
day
,
in
his
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
My
imagination
be
so
much
employ
in
anticipate
the
happiness
I
be
to
enjoy
next
day
,
that
I
sleep
very
little
that
night
;
but
get
up
early
in
the
morning
,
go
to
the
place
appoint
,
where
I
meet
my
she
-
friend
,
and
impart
to
her
my
success
with
the
squire
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
much
pleased
at
the
occasion
,
which
(
she
say
)
could
not
fail
of
be
agreeable
to
Narcissa
,
who
in
spite
of
her
passion
for
me
,
have
mention
some
scruple
relate
to
my
true
situation
and
character
,
which
the
delicacy
of
her
sentiment
suggest
,
and
which
she
believe
I
would
find
it
necessary
to
remove
,
though
she
do
not
know
how
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
a
good
deal
startle
at
this
insinuation
,
because
I
foresaw
the
difficulty
I
should
find
in
barely
do
myself
justice
;
for
although
it
never
be
my
intention
to
impose
myself
upon
any
woman
,
much
less
on
Narcissa
,
as
a
man
of
fortune
,
I
lay
claim
to
the
character
of
a
gentleman
,
by
birth
,
education
and
behaviour
;
and
<EOS>
yet
(
so
unlucky
have
the
circumstance
of
my
life
fall
out
)
<EOS>
I
should
find
it
a
very
hard
matter
to
make
good
my
pretension
even
to
these
,
especially
to
the
last
,
which
be
the
most
essential
 
Miss
Williams
be
as
sensible
as
I
,
of
this
my
disadvantage
;
but
comfort
me
with
observe
,
that
when
once
a
woman
have
bestow
her
affection
on
a
man
,
she
can
not
help
judge
of
him
in
all
respect
,
with
a
partiality
easily
influence
in
his
favour
;
 
<EOS>
she
remark
that
altho
'
some
situation
of
my
life
have
be
low
,
yet
none
of
them
have
be
infamous
;
that
my
indigence
have
be
the
crime
not
of
me
,
but
of
fortune
;
and
that
the
misery
I
have
undergo
,
by
improve
the
faculty
both
of
mind
and
body
,
qualify
me
the
more
for
any
dignified
station
;
and
would
of
consequence
,
recommend
me
to
the
good
grace
of
any
sensible
woman
;
 
she
therefore
advise
me
to
be
always
open
and
unreserved
to
the
inquiry
of
my
mistress
,
without
unnecessarily
betray
the
mean
occurrence
of
my
fate
;
and
trust
to
the
strength
of
her
love
and
reflection
,
for
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
the
sentiment
of
this
sensible
young
woman
on
this
,
as
well
as
on
almost
every
other
subject
,
perfectly
agree
with
mine
;
I
thank
her
for
the
care
she
take
of
my
interest
,
and
promise
to
behave
myself
accord
to
her
direction
,
we
part
,
after
she
have
assure
me
,
that
I
may
depend
upon
her
good
office
with
her
mistress
,
and
that
she
would
from
time
to
time
,
communicate
to
me
such
intelligence
as
she
could
procure
,
relate
to
my
flame
.
 
<EOS>
have
dress
myself
to
the
good
advantage
,
I
wait
for
the
time
of
dinner
with
the
most
fearful
impatience
;
and
as
the
hour
draw
nigh
,
my
heart
beat
with
such
increase
velocity
,
and
my
spirit
contract
such
disorder
,
that
I
begin
to
suspect
my
resolution
,
and
even
to
wish
myself
disengage
:
 
<EOS>
at
last
Mr
Freeman
call
at
my
lodging
,
in
his
way
,
and
I
accompany
him
to
the
house
where
all
my
happiness
be
deposit
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
very
kindly
receive
by
the
squire
,
who
sit
smoake
his
pipe
in
a
parlour
,
and
ask
if
we
choose
to
drink
any
thing
before
dinner
;
tho
'
I
never
have
more
occasion
for
a
cordial
,
I
be
ashamed
to
accept
his
offer
,
which
be
also
refuse
by
my
friend
.
    
<EOS>
We
sit
down
(
however
)
and
enter
into
conversation
,
which
last
half
an
hour
,
so
that
I
have
time
to
recollect
myself
;
and
(
so
capricious
be
my
thought
)
even
to
hope
that
Narcissa
would
not
appear
 
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
a
servant
come
in
,
give
us
notice
that
dinner
be
upon
the
table
 
and
my
perturbation
return
with
such
violence
,
that
I
could
scarce
conceal
it
from
the
company
as
I
ascend
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
enter
the
dining
-
room
,
the
first
object
that
salute
my
ravish
eye
,
be
the
divine
Narcissa
,
blush
like
Aurora
,
adorn
with
all
the
grace
that
meekness
,
innocence
and
beauty
can
diffuse
!
<EOS>
I
be
seize
with
a
giddiness
,
my
knee
totter
,
and
I
scarce
have
strength
enough
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
salutation
,
when
her
brother
slap
me
upon
the
shoulder
,
cry
"
Measter
Randan
,
that
there
be
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
approach
her
with
eagerness
and
fear
;
but
in
the
moment
of
our
embrace
,
my
soul
be
agonize
with
rapture
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
lucky
circumstance
for
us
both
,
that
my
entertainer
be
not
endue
with
an
uncommon
stock
of
penetration
;
for
our
mutual
confusion
be
so
manifest
,
that
Mr
Freeman
perceive
it
,
and
as
we
go
home
together
,
congratulate
me
on
my
good
fortune
.
     
<EOS>
but
so
far
be
Bruin
from
entertain
the
least
suspicion
,
that
he
encourage
me
to
begin
a
conversation
with
my
mistress
in
a
language
unknown
to
him
,
by
tell
her
,
that
he
have
bring
a
gentleman
(
mean
me
)
who
could
jabber
with
her
in
French
and
other
foreign
lingo
,
as
fast
as
she
please
:
then
turn
to
me
,
say
,
"
odd
bobs
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
hold
discourse
with
her
,
in
your
French
or
Italiano
;
and
tell
me
if
she
understand
it
as
well
as
she
would
be
think
to
do
 
there
be
her
aunt
and
she
will
chatter
together
whole
day
in
it
,
and
I
can
not
have
a
mouthful
of
English
for
love
or
money
.
<EOS>
"
I
consult
the
look
of
my
amiable
mistress
,
and
sound
her
averse
to
his
proposal
,
which
indeed
she
decline
with
a
sweetness
of
denial
peculiar
to
herself
,
as
a
piece
of
disrespect
to
that
part
of
the
company
which
do
not
understand
the
language
in
question
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
the
happiness
of
sit
opposite
to
her
,
I
feast
my
eye
much
more
than
my
palate
,
which
she
tempt
in
vain
with
the
most
delicious
bit
carve
by
her
fair
hand
,
and
recommend
by
her
persuasive
tongue
;
 
but
all
my
other
appetite
be
swallow
up
in
the
immensity
of
my
love
,
which
I
feed
by
gaze
incessantly
on
the
delightful
object
.
 
<EOS>
dinner
be
scarce
end
,
when
the
squire
become
very
drousy
,
and
after
several
dreadful
yawn
,
get
up
,
stretch
himself
,
take
two
or
three
turn
across
the
room
,
<EOS>
begg'd
we
would
allow
him
to
take
a
short
nap
,
and
have
lay
a
strong
injunction
on
his
sister
to
detain
us
 
'
till
his
return
,
go
to
his
repose
without
any
further
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
go
many
minute
,
when
Freeman
guess
the
situation
of
my
heart
,
and
think
he
could
not
do
me
a
great
favour
,
than
to
leave
me
alone
with
Narcissa
,
pretend
to
recollect
himself
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
start
up
,
begg'd
<EOS>
the
lady
's
pardon
for
half
an
hour
,
have
luckily
remember
an
engagement
of
some
consequence
,
that
he
must
perform
at
that
instant
,
 
so
say
,
he
go
away
,
promise
to
be
back
in
time
enough
for
tea
;
leave
my
mistress
and
me
in
great
confusion
.
     
<EOS>
now
that
I
enjoy
an
opportunity
of
disclose
the
panting
,
of
my
soul
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
power
to
use
it
 
<EOS>
I
study
many
pathetic
declaration
,
but
when
I
attempt
to
give
them
utterance
,
my
tongue
deny
its
office
;
and
she
sit
silent
,
with
a
downcast
look
full
of
anxious
alarm
,
her
bosom
heave
with
expectation
of
some
great
event
 
at
length
<EOS>
,
I
endeavour
to
put
an
end
to
this
solemn
pause
,
and
begin
with
"
It
be
very
surprizing
,
Madam
 
here
the
sound
die
away
,
I
make
a
full
stop
 
while
Narcissa
start
,
blush
,
and
with
a
timid
accent
,
answer
,
"
Sir
?
 
<EOS>
confound
at
this
note
of
interrogation
,
I
pronounce
with
the
most
sheepish
bashfulness
,
"
Madam
!
"
<EOS>
to
which
she
reply
,
"
I
beg
pardon
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
speak
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
another
pause
ensue
 
<EOS>
I
make
another
effort
,
and
tho
'
my
voice
faultere
very
much
at
the
beginning
,
make
shift
to
express
myself
in
this
manner
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Madam
,
'
tis
very
surprizing
that
love
should
act
so
inconsistent
with
itself
,
as
to
deprive
its
votary
of
the
use
of
their
faculty
,
when
they
have
most
occasion
for
them
.
<EOS>
since
the
happy
occasion
of
be
alone
with
you
present
itself
,
I
have
make
many
unsuccessful
attempt
to
declare
a
passion
for
the
lovely
of
her
sex
 
<EOS>
a
passion
which
take
possession
of
my
soul
,
while
my
cruel
fate
compell'd
me
to
wear
a
servile
disguise
so
unsuitable
to
my
birth
,
sentiment
,
and
let
me
add
,
my
desert
;
yet
favourable
in
one
respect
,
as
it
furnish
me
with
opportunity
of
see
and
adore
your
perfection
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Madam
,
it
be
then
your
dear
idea
enter
my
bosom
,
where
it
have
live
unimpaired
in
the
midst
of
numberless
care
,
and
animate
me
against
a
thousand
danger
and
calamity
!
"
     
<EOS>
while
I
speak
thus
,
she
conceal
her
face
with
her
fan
;
and
when
I
cease
,
recover
herself
from
the
most
beautiful
confusion
,
tell
me
,
that
she
think
herself
very
much
oblige
by
my
favourable
opinion
of
her
;
and
that
she
be
very
sorry
to
hear
I
have
be
unfortunate
 
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
gentle
reply
<EOS>
,
I
proceed
,
own
myself
sufficiently
recompense
by
her
kind
compassion
for
what
I
have
undergo
,
and
declare
that
the
future
happiness
of
my
life
depend
solely
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
ungrateful
,
if
after
the
signal
protection
you
once
afford
me
,
I
could
refuse
to
contribute
towards
your
happiness
,
in
any
reasonable
condescension
.
"
 
<EOS>
transport
at
this
acknowledgment
;
I
throw
myself
at
her
foot
,
and
beg
she
would
regard
my
passion
with
a
favourable
eye
:
<EOS>
She
be
alarm
at
my
behaviour
,
intreate
me
to
rise
lest
her
brother
should
discover
me
in
that
posture
,
and
to
spare
her
,
for
the
present
,
upon
a
subject
for
which
she
be
altogether
unprepared
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
I
rise
,
assure
her
I
would
rather
die
than
disobey
her
;
but
in
the
mean
time
beg
her
to
consider
how
precious
the
minute
of
this
opportunity
be
,
and
what
restraint
I
put
upon
my
inclination
,
in
sacrifice
them
to
her
desire
.
     
<EOS>
She
smile
with
unspeakable
sweetness
,
and
say
,
there
would
be
no
want
of
opportunity
,
<EOS>
provide
I
could
maintain
the
good
opinion
her
brother
have
conceive
of
me
;
and
I
,
enchant
with
her
charm
,
seize
her
hand
,
<EOS>
which
I
well
nigh
devour
with
kiss
 
<EOS>
but
she
check'd
<EOS>
my
boldness
with
a
severity
of
countenance
;
and
desire
<EOS>
I
would
not
so
far
forget
myself
or
her
,
as
to
endanger
the
esteem
she
have
for
me
;
 
she
remind
me
of
our
be
almost
stranger
to
one
another
,
and
of
the
necessity
there
be
,
for
her
know
me
better
,
before
she
could
take
any
resolution
in
my
favour
;
and
,
in
short
,
mingle
so
much
good
sense
and
complacency
in
her
reproof
,
that
I
become
as
much
enamour
of
her
understanding
,
as
I
have
be
before
of
her
beauty
,
and
ask
pardon
for
my
presumption
with
the
utmost
reverence
of
conviction
 
<EOS>
She
forgive
my
offence
with
her
usual
affability
;
and
seal
my
pardon
with
a
look
so
full
of
bewitch
tenderness
,
that
for
some
minute
,
my
sense
be
lose
in
exstasy
!
<EOS>
I
afterwards
endeavour
to
regulate
my
behaviour
accord
to
her
desire
,
and
turn
the
conversation
upon
a
more
indifferent
subject
;
but
her
presence
be
an
unsurmountable
obstacle
to
my
design
;
while
I
beheld
so
much
excellence
,
I
find
it
impossible
to
call
my
attention
from
the
contemplation
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
gaze
with
unutterable
fondness
!
<EOS>
I
grow
mad
with
admiration
!
 
<EOS>
"
My
condition
be
unsupportable
(
cry
i
)
<EOS>
I
be
distract
with
passion
!
<EOS>
why
be
you
so
exquisitely
fair
?
 
<EOS>
why
be
you
so
enchantingly
good
?
 
<EOS>
why
have
nature
dignify
you
with
charm
so
much
above
the
standard
of
woman
;
and
,
wretch
that
I
be
,
how
dare
my
unworthiness
aspire
to
the
enjoyment
of
such
perfection
!
"
    
<EOS>
She
be
startle
at
my
raving
,
reason
down
my
transport
,
and
by
her
irresistible
eloquence
,
soothe
my
soul
into
a
state
of
tranquil
felicity
;
but
lest
I
may
suffer
a
relapse
,
industriously
promote
other
subject
to
entertain
my
imagination
 
<EOS>
she
chide
me
for
have
omit
to
inquire
about
her
aunt
,
who
(
she
assure
me
)
in
the
midst
of
all
her
absence
of
temper
,
and
detachment
from
common
affair
,
often
talk
of
me
with
uncommon
warmth
.
     
<EOS>
I
profess
my
veneration
for
the
good
lady
,
excuse
my
omission
,
by
impute
it
to
the
violence
of
my
love
,
which
engross
my
whole
soul
,
and
desire
to
know
the
present
situation
of
her
health
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
,
the
amiable
Narcissa
repeat
what
I
have
hear
before
,
of
her
marriage
,
with
all
the
tenderness
for
her
reputation
that
the
subject
would
admit
of
;
tell
me
,
she
liv'd
with
her
husband
,
hard
by
,
and
be
so
much
afflict
with
a
dropsy
,
and
waste
by
a
consumption
,
that
she
have
small
hope
of
her
recovery
.
     
<EOS>
have
express
my
sorrow
for
her
distemper
,
I
question
her
about
my
good
friend
Mrs
Sagely
,
who
I
learn
(
to
my
great
satisfaction
)
be
still
in
good
health
,
and
by
the
encomium
she
bestow
upon
me
after
I
be
go
,
confirm
the
favourable
impression
,
my
behaviour
at
parting
have
make
on
Narcissa
's
heart
 
<EOS>
this
circumstance
introduce
an
inquiry
into
the
conduct
of
Sir
Timothy
Thicket
,
who
(
she
inform
me
)
have
find
mean
to
incense
her
brother
so
much
against
me
,
that
she
find
it
impossible
to
undeceive
him
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
suffer
very
much
in
her
own
character
,
by
his
scandalous
insinuation
 
that
the
whole
parish
be
alarm
,
and
actually
in
pursuit
of
me
;
so
that
she
have
be
in
the
utmost
consternation
upon
my
account
,
<EOS>
well
know
how
little
my
own
innocence
and
her
testimony
would
have
weigh
with
the
ignorance
,
prejudice
and
brutality
of
those
,
who
must
have
judge
me
,
have
I
be
apprehend
 
that
Sir
Timothy
be
seize
with
a
fit
of
the
apoplexy
,
from
which
with
great
difficulty
he
be
recover
,
begin
to
be
apprehensive
of
death
,
and
to
prepare
himself
accordingly
for
that
great
event
;
as
a
step
to
which
,
he
send
for
her
brother
,
own
with
great
contrition
,
the
brutal
design
he
have
upon
her
,
and
of
consequence
acquit
me
of
the
assault
,
robbery
and
correspondence
with
her
,
which
he
have
lay
to
my
charge
,
after
which
confession
he
live
about
a
month
in
a
languish
condition
,
and
be
carry
off
by
a
second
assault
.
    
<EOS>
every
word
that
this
dear
creature
speak
,
rivette
the
chain
with
which
she
hold
me
enslave
!
<EOS>
My
mischievous
fancy
begin
to
work
,
and
the
temp
of
my
passion
to
wake
again
;
when
the
return
of
Freeman
destroy
the
tempting
opportunity
,
and
enable
me
to
quell
the
rise
tumult
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
while
after
,
the
Squire
stagger
into
the
room
,
rub
his
eye
,
and
call
for
his
tea
,
which
he
drink
out
of
a
small
bowl
,
qualified
with
brandy
;
we
sip
some
in
the
ordinary
way
:
<EOS>
Narcissa
leave
us
in
order
to
visit
her
aunt
,
and
when
Freeman
and
I
propose
to
take
our
leave
,
the
fox
-
hunter
insist
on
our
spend
the
evening
at
his
house
with
such
obstinacy
of
affection
,
that
we
be
oblige
to
comply
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
should
have
be
glad
of
the
invitation
,
by
which
,
in
all
likelihood
,
I
would
be
bless
with
his
sister
's
company
,
have
I
not
be
afraid
of
risk
her
esteem
,
by
enter
into
a
debauch
of
drink
with
him
,
which
,
from
the
knowledge
of
his
character
,
I
foresaw
would
happen
;
but
there
be
no
remedy
 
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
rely
upon
the
strength
of
my
constitution
,
which
I
hope
would
resist
intoxication
longer
than
the
Squire
's
;
and
to
trust
to
the
good
-
nature
and
discretion
of
my
mistress
for
the
rest
.
    
<EOS>
Our
entertainer
resolve
to
begin
by
time
,
order
the
table
to
be
furnish
with
liquor
and
glass
immediately
after
tea
,
but
we
absolutely
refuse
to
set
in
for
drinking
so
soon
;
and
prevail
upon
him
to
pass
away
an
hour
or
two
at
whist
,
in
which
we
engage
as
soon
as
Narcissa
return
.
 
<EOS>
the
savage
<EOS>
and
I
happen
to
be
partner
at
first
,
and
as
my
thought
be
wholly
employ
on
a
more
interesting
game
,
<EOS>
I
play'd
<EOS>
so
ill
that
he
lose
all
patience
,
swear
bitterly
,
and
threaten
to
call
for
wine
if
they
would
not
grant
him
another
associate
.
 
<EOS>
this
desire
be
gratify
,
and
Narcissa
and
I
be
of
a
side
;
he
win
for
the
same
reason
that
make
him
lose
before
;
I
be
satisfied
,
my
lovely
partner
do
not
repine
,
and
the
time
slip
away
very
agreeably
,
until
we
be
tell
that
supper
be
serve
in
another
room
.
    
<EOS>
the
Squire
be
enrage
to
find
the
evening
so
unprofitably
spend
,
and
wreck
his
vengeance
on
the
card
,
which
he
tear
,
and
commit
to
the
flame
with
many
execration
;
threatne
to
make
us
redeem
our
loss
with
a
large
glass
and
a
quick
circulation
;
and
indeed
we
have
no
sooner
sup
,
and
my
charmer
withdraw
,
than
he
begin
to
put
his
threat
in
execution
.
<EOS>
three
bottle
of
port
(
for
he
drink
no
other
sort
of
wine
)
be
place
before
us
,
with
as
many
water
-
glass
,
which
be
immediately
fill
to
the
brim
,
after
his
example
,
by
each
out
of
his
respective
allowance
,
and
empty
in
a
trice
,
to
the
good
in
christendom
.
     
<EOS>
though
I
swallow
this
,
and
the
next
as
fast
as
the
glass
could
be
replenish
,
without
hesitation
or
shew
of
reluctance
,
I
perceive
that
my
brain
would
not
be
able
to
bear
many
bumper
of
this
sort
;
and
dread
the
perseverance
of
a
champion
who
begin
with
such
vigour
,
I
determine
to
make
up
for
the
deficiency
of
my
strength
by
a
stratagem
,
which
I
actually
put
in
practice
when
the
second
course
of
bottle
be
call
for
.
 
<EOS>
the
wine
be
strong
and
heady
,
I
be
already
a
good
deal
discompose
by
the
dispatch
we
have
make
,
Freeman
's
eye
begin
to
reel
,
and
Bruin
himself
be
elevate
into
a
song
,
which
he
utter
with
great
vociferation
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
therefore
see
the
second
round
bring
in
,
I
assume
a
gay
air
,
entertain
him
with
a
french
catch
on
the
subject
of
drinking
,
which
,
though
he
do
not
understand
it
,
delight
him
highly
,
and
tell
him
that
your
choice
spirit
at
Paris
never
trouble
themselves
with
glass
,
ask
if
he
have
not
a
bowl
or
cup
in
the
house
that
would
contain
a
whole
quart
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
"
odd
nigger
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
I
have
a
silver
caudle
-
cup
that
hold
just
the
quantity
,
for
all
the
world
 
<EOS>
fetch
it
hither
,
Numps
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
vessel
be
produce
,
I
bid
him
decant
his
bottle
into
it
,
which
have
do
<EOS>
,
I
nod
in
a
very
deliberate
manner
,
and
say
,
"
pledge
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
stare
at
me
for
some
time
,
and
cry
,
"
what
!
<EOS>
all
at
one
pull
,
measter

?
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
at
one
pull
!
<EOS>
Sir

<EOS>
"
Shall
you

<EOS>
(
say
he
,
shake
me
by
the
hand
)
<EOS>
odd
then
,
I
will
see
it
out
,
an't

a
mile

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
apply
it
to
his
lip
,
and
empty
it
in
a
breath
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
effect
of
it
would
be
almost
instantaneous
;
therefore
,
take
the
cup
,
I
begin
to
discharge
my
bottle
into
it
,
tell
him
he
be
now
qualified
to
drink
with
the
Cham
of
Tartary
.
     
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
pronounce
these
word
,
than
he
take
umbrage
at
them
,
and
after
several
attempt
to
spit
,
make
shift
to
stutter
out
,
"

<EOS>
then
drop
his
jaw
,
and
fix
his
eye
,
he
hick
up'd
aloud
,
and
fall
upon
the
floor
as
mute
as

Mr

CHAPTER

and

perplex
with

have
the
honour
of

partner
at

<EOS>
we
be
compliment
by
a
certain
Nobleman
 
<EOS>
he
discover
some
symptom
of
passion
for
Narcissa
 
<EOS>
I
be
sting
with
jealousy
 
Narcissa
alarm
,
retire
 
<EOS>
I
observe
Melinda
in
the
company
 
<EOS>
the
Squire
be
captivate
by
her
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
meet
next
morning
,
at
the
usual
place
by
Miss
Williams
,
who
give
me
joy
of
the
progress
I
have
make
in
the
affection
of
her
mistress
,
and
bless
me
with
an
account
of
that
dear
creature
's
conversation
with
her
,
after
she
have
retire
the
night
before
from
our
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
scarce
believe
her
information
,
when
she
recount
her
expression
in
my
favour
,
so
much
more
warm
and
passionate
be
they
than
my
most
sanguine
hope
have
presage
;
and
be
particularly
pleased
to
hear
that
she
approve
of
my
behaviour
to
her
brother
,
after
she
withdraw
.
     
<EOS>
Transported
at
the
news
of
my
happiness
,
I
present
my
ring
to
the
messenger
,
as
a
testimony
of
my
gratitude
and
satisfaction
;
but
she
be
above
such
mercenary
consideration
,
and
refuse
my
compliment
with
some
resentment
,
say
,
she
be
not
a
little
mortify
to
see
my
opinion
of
her
so
low
and
contemptible
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
myself
a
piece
of
justice
by
explain
my
behaviour
on
this
head
,
and
to
convince
her
of
my
esteem
,
promise
to
be
rule
by
her
direction
in
the
prosecution
of
the
whole
affair
,
which
I
have
so
much
at
heart
,
that
the
repose
of
my
life
depend
upon
the
consequence
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
fervently
wish
for
another
interview
,
where
I
may
pour
out
the
effusion
of
my
love
,
without
danger
of
be
interrupt
,
and
perhaps
reap
some
endearing
return
from
the
queen
of
my
desire
,
I
implore
her
advice
and
assistance
in
promote
this
event
;
 
but
she
give
me
to
understand
,
that
Narcissa
would
make
no
precipitate
compliance
of
this
kind
,
and
that
I
would
do
well
to
cultivate
her
brother
's
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
I
would
not
want
opportunity
of
remove
that
reserve
,
which
my
mistress
think
herself
oblige
to
maintain
during
the
infancy
of
our
correspondence
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
she
promise
to
tell
her
lady
that
I
have
endeavour
by
present
and
persuasion
,
to
prevail
upon
her
,
(
Miss
Williams
)
to
deliver
a
letter
from
me
,
which
she
have
refuse
to
charge
herself
with
,
until
she
should
know
Narcissa
's
sentiment
of
the
matter
;
and
say
,
by
these
mean
she
do
not
doubt
of
be
able
to
open
a
literary
communication
between
us
,
which
could
not
fail
of
introduce
more
intimate
connexion
.
    
<EOS>
I
approve
of
her
counsel
,
and
our
appointment
be
renew
for
next
day
,
leave
her
with
an
intent
of
fall
upon
some
method
of
be
reconcile
to
the
Squire
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
would
be
offend
with
the
trick
we
have
put
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
I
consult
Freeman
,
who
from
his
knowledge
of
the
Fox
-
hunter
's
disposition
,
assure
me
there
be
no
other
method
of
pacify
him
,
than
that
of
sacrifice
ourselves
for
one
night
,
to
an
equal
match
with
him
in
drinking
:
<EOS>
this
I
find
myself
necessitate
to
comply
with
,
for
the
interest
of
my
passion
,
and
therefore
determine
to
commit
the
debauch
at
my
own
lodging
,
that
I
may
run
no
risk
of
be
discover
by
Narcissa
,
in
a
state
of
brutal
degeneracy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Freeman
,
who
be
to
be
of
the
party
,
go
,
at
my
desire
,
to
the
Squire
in
order
to
engage
him
,
while
I
take
care
to
furnish
myself
for
his
reception
.
 
<EOS>
My
invitation
be
accept
,
my
guest
honour
me
with
their
company
in
the
evening
,
when
Bruin
give
me
to
understand
that
he
have
drink
many
tun
of
wine
in
his
life
,
but
be
never
serve
such
a
trick
as
I
have
play
upon
him
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
I
promise
to
atone
for
my
trespass
,
and
have
order
to
every
man
his
bottle
,
begin
the
contest
with
a
bumper
to
the
health
of
Narcissa
.
 
<EOS>
the
toast
circulate
with
great
devotion
,
the
liquor
begin
to
operate
,
our
mirth
grow
noisy
,
and
as
Freeman
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
advantage
of
drink
small
french
claret
,
the
savage
be
effectually
tame
before
our
sense
be
in
the
least
affected
,
and
carry
home
in
a
kind
of
apoplexy
of
drunkenness
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
next
morning
,
as
usual
,
favour
with
a
visit
from
my
kind
and
punctual
confidante
,
who
tell
me
<EOS>
,

to
receive
my
letter
for
her
mistress
;
I
take
up
the
pen
immediately
,
and
follow
the
first
dictate
of
my
passion
,
write
as
follow
:
    
"
Dear

and
chill

with
an

break
off
all

"
SIR
,
to
say
I
look
upon
you
with
indifference

would
be
a
piece
of
dissimulation
which
,
I
think
,
no
decorum
require
,
and
no
custom
can
justify
.
<EOS>
as
my
heart
never

an
impression
that
my
tongue
be
ashamed
to
declare
,
I
will
not
scruple
to
own
myself
pleased
with
your

confident

the

,
be
I
not
over

that
with
which
I
kiss
this
inimitable
proof
of
my
charmer

candour
,
generosity
and
affection
!
<EOS>
I
read
it
over
an
hundred
time
;
be
ravish
with
her
confession
in
the
beginning

the
subscription
of
Your

My

tender
expression

when

in

I
have
all
the
reason

bosom
be
possess
by
a
passion
for
me

as
warm

perhaps
not
so
impetuous

mine
for

myself
the
honour

of
his

I

her
as
indulgent

have
be
complaisant
in
that
particular

<EOS>
Miss

express
a

at
hearing
I
be
so
much
in

venture
to
assure
me
,
that
my
visit
would
be
very
agreeable

the
rather
because
Bruin

abroad

<EOS>
this
be
a
circumstance

I
scarce
need

please
me

I
go
immediately
to
the
long

room
,
where
I
find
him
,
and
affect
to
know
nothing
of
his
engagement

tell
him

I
would
do
myself
the
pleasure
to
wait
upon
him
in

afternoon

to
present
his
sister
with
a
ticket
for

He

to
understand
that
he
be
to
dine
abroad
,
desire
me
to
go
and
drink
tea
with
Narcissa
notwithstanding
,
and
promise
to
prepare
her
for
my
visit
in
the
mean
time
.
    
<EOS>
every
thing
succeed
thus
to
my
wish
,
I
wait
with
incredible
patience
for
the
time
,
which
no
sooner
arrive
,
than
I
hasten
to
the
scene
,
which
my
fancy
have
pre
-
occupied
long
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
introduce
accordingly
,
to
the
dear
enchantress
,
whom
I
find
accompany
by
Miss
Williams
,
who
,
on
pretence
of
order
tea
,
retire
at
my
approach
.
 
<EOS>
this
favourable
accident
,
which
alarm
my
whole
soul
,
disorder
her
also
.
     
<EOS>
I
find
myself
actuate
by
an
irresistible
impulse
,
I
advance
to
her
with
eagerness
and
awe
;
and
profit
by
the
confusion
that
prevail
over
her
,
clasp
the
fair
angel
in
my
arm
,
and
imprint
a
glowing
kiss
upon
her
lip
,
more
soft
and
fragrant
than
the
dewy
rosebud
just
burst
from
the
stem
!
<EOS>
Her
face
be
in
an
instant
cover
with
blush
,
her
eye
sparkle
with
resentment
;
I
throw
myself
at
her
foot
,
and
implore
her
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
Her
love
become
advocate
in
my
cause
;
her
look
soften
into
forgiveness
,
she
raise
me
up
,
and
chid
me
with
so
much
sweetness
of
displeasure
,
that
I
be
tempt
to
repeat
the
offence
,
have
not
the
coming
of
a
servant
with
the
tea
-
board
,
prevent
my
presumption
.
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
subject
to
be
interrupt
or
over
-
hear
,
we
converse
about
the
approach
ball
,
at
which
she
promise
to
grace
me
as
a
partner
;
but
when
the
equipage
be
remove
,
and
we
be
leave
alone
,
I
resume
the
more
interesting
theme
,
and
express
myself
with
such
transport
and
agitation
,
that
my
mistress
,
fear
I
would
commit
some
extravagance
,
ring
the
bell
for
her
maid
,
whom
she
detain
in
the
room
,
as
a
check
upon
my
vivacity
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sorry
for
this
precaution
,
because
I
could
unbosom
myself
without
reserve
,
before
Miss
Williams
,
who
be
the
confidante
of
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
give
a
loose
to
the
inspiration
of
my
passion
,
which
operate
so
successfully
upon
the
tender
affection
of
Narcissa
,
that
she
lay
aside
the
restraint
she
have
hitherto
wear
,
and
bless
me
with
the
most
melt
declaration
of
her
mutual
flame
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
forbear
take
the
advantage
of
this
endear
condescension
.
     
<EOS>
She
now
gently
yield
to
my
embrace
,
while
I
encircle
all
that
I
hold
dear
,
within
my
arm
,
taste
in
advance
,
the
joy
of
that
paradise
I
hope
in
a
little
time
wholly
to
possess
!
 
<EOS>
We
spend
the
afternoon
in
all
the
exstacy
of
hope
that
the
most
fervent
love
exchange
by
mutual
vow
could
inspire
;
and
Miss
Williams
be
so
much
affected
with
our
chaste
caress
,
which
recall
the
sad
remembrance
of
what
she
be
,
that
her
eye
be
fill
with
tear
.
    
<EOS>
the
evening
be
pretty
far
advanced
,
I
force
myself
from
the
dear
object
of
my
flame
,
who
indulge
me
in
a
tender
embrace
at
part
;
and
repair
to
my
lodging
,
communicate
to
my
friend
Strap
every
circumstance
of
my
happiness
,
which
fill
him
with
so
much
pleasure
,
that
it
run
over
at
his
eye
;
and
he
pray
heartily
,
that
no
envious
devil
may
,
as
formerly
,
dash
the
cup
of
blessing
from
my
lip
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
reflect
on
what
have
happen
,
and
especially
on
the
unreserved
protestation
of
Narcissa
's
love
,
I
could
not
help
be
amazed
at
her
omit
to
enquire
into
the
particular
circumstance
of
the
life
and
fortune
of
one
whom
she
have
favour
with
her
affection
,
and
I
begin
to
be
a
little
anxious
about
the
situation
of
her
finance
;
<EOS>
well
know
that
I
should
do
an
irreparable
injury
to
the
person
my
soul
hold
most
dear
,
if
I
should
espouse
her
,
without
be
enable
to
support
her
in
the
rank
which
be
certainly
her
due
.
     
<EOS>
I
have
hear
indeed
,
while
I
serve
her
aunt
,
that
her
father
have
leave
her
a
considerable
sum
;
and
that
every
body
believe
she
would
inherit
the
great
part
of
her
kinswoman
's
dowry
,
but
I
do
not
know
how
far
she
may
be
restrict
by
the
old
gentleman
's
will
,
in
the
enjoyment
of
what
he
leave
her
;
and
I
be
too
well
informed
of
the
virtuosi
's
late
conduct
,
to
think
my
mistress
could
have
any
expectation
from
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
I
confide
,
however
,
in
the
good
sense
and
delicacy
of
my
charmer
,
who
,
I
be
sure
,
would
not
consent
to
unite
her
fate
with
mine
,
before
she
have
fully
consider
and
provide
for
the
consequence
.
    
<EOS>
the
ball
-
night
be
arrive
,
I
dress
myself
in
a
suit
I
have
reserve
for
some
grand
occasion
;
and
have
drink
tea
with
Narcissa
and
her
brother
,
conduct
my
angel
to
the
scene
,
where
she
in
a
moment
eclipse
all
her
female
competitor
for
beauty
,
and
attract
the
admiration
of
the
whole
assembly
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
dilate
with
pride
on
this
occasion
,
and
my
triumph
reject
all
bound
,
when
,
after
we
have
dance
together
,
a
certain
nobleman
,
remarkable
for
his
figure
and
influence
in
the
beau
monde
,
come
up
,
and
in
the
hearing
of
all
present
,
honour
us
with
a
very
particular
compliment
,
upon
our
accomplishment
and
appearance
;
 
but
this
transport
be
soon
check
,
when
I
perceive
his
lordship
attach
himself
with
great
assiduity
to
my
mistress
;
and
say
some
warm
thing
,
which
I
think
,
savour
too
much
of
passion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
<EOS>
I
begin
to
feel
the
pang
of
jealousy
 
<EOS>
I
dread
the
power
and
address
of
my
rival
 
<EOS>
I
sicken
at
his
discourse
;
when
she
open
her
lip
to
answer
,
my
heart
die
within
me
 
<EOS>
when
she
smile
,
I
feel
the
pain
of
the
damned
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
enrage
at
his
presumption
;
I
curse
her
complaisance
!
<EOS>
when
he
quit
her
and
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
     
<EOS>
Narcissa
suspect
nothing
of
the
rage
that
inflame
me
,
put
some
question
to
me
,
as
soon
as
he
be
go
,
to
which
I
make
no
other
reply
than
a
grim
look
,
which
too
well
denote
the
agitation
of
my
breast
,
and
surprize
her
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
She
no
sooner
observe
my
emotion
,
than
she
change
colour
,
and
ask
what
ail
me
;
but
before
I
could
make
answer
,
her
brother
pull
me
by
the
sleeve
,
bid
me
take
notice
of
a
lady
who
sit
front
us
,
whom
I
immediately
,
to
my
vast
astonishment
,
distinguish
to
be
Melinda
,
accompany
by
her
mother
and
an
elderly
gentleman
,
whom
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wounds
!
<EOS>
Mr
Randan
,
(
cry
the
Squire
)
be
she
not
a
delicate
piece
of
stuff
?
 
<EOS>
"
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
 
if
I
think
she
be
a
single
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
perplexity
<EOS>
I
be
in
<EOS>
,
I
have
reflection
enough
to
foresee
that
my
passion
may
suffer
greatly
by
the
presence
of
this
lady
,
who
in
all
probability
would
revenge
herself
upon
me
for
have
formerly
disgrace
her
,
by
spread
report
to
my
prejudice
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
alarm
at
these
symptom
of
the
Squire
's
admiration
;
and
for
some
time
do
not
know
what
reply
to
make
,
when
he
ask
my
opinion
of
her
beauty
:
at
length
I
come
to
a
determination
,
and
tell
him
that
her
name
be
Melinda
,
that
she
have
a
fortune
of
ten
thousand
pound
,
and
be
say
to
be
under
promise
of
marriage
to
a
certain
lord
,
who
defer
his
nuptial
,
until
he
should
be
of
age
,
which
would
happen
in
a
few
month
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
which
I
have
myself
invent
,
would
have
hinder
him
effectually
from
entertain
any
further
thought
of
her
;
but
I
be
egregiously
mistaken
:
the
fox
-
hunter
have
too
much
self
-
sufficiency
to
despair
of
success
with
any
competitor
on
earth
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
make
light
of
her
engagement
,
say
,
with
a
smile
of
self
-
approbation
,
"
mayhap
she
will
change
her
mind
 
<EOS>
what
signify
his
be
a
Lord
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
myself
as
good
a
man
as
e'er
a
Lord
in
christendom
;
and
I
will
see
if
a
commoner
worth
three
thousand
a
year
will
not
serve
her
turn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
determination
startle
me
not
a
little
;
I
know
he
would
soon
discover
the
contrary
of
what
I
advance
,
and
as
I
believe
he
would
find
her
ear
open
to
his
address
,
do
not
doubt
of
meet
with
every
obstacle
in
my
amour
,
that
her
malice
could
invent
,
and
her
influence
with
him
execute
.
 
<EOS>
this
reflection
increase
my
chagrin
 
<EOS>
My
vexation
be
evident
 
Narcissa
insist
on
go
home
immediately
;
and
as
I
lead
her
to
the
door
,
her
noble
admirer
,
with
a
look
full
of
languishment
,
direct
to
her
a
profound
bow
,
which
sting
me
to
the
soul
.
 
<EOS>
before
she
go
into
the
chair
,
she
ask
,
with
an
appearance
of
concern
,
what
be
the
matter
with
me
?
<EOS>
and
I
could
pronounce
no
more
than
,
"

have
utter

I
go
home

find
the
fire

vent
my
fury
upon

I
pinch
with

sensible

the
injury
I
have

shake
his

"

forgive

he
could
not
help
shed
some
tear
at
my
unkindness

<EOS>
I
feel
unspeakable
remorse
for
what
I
have
do
,
curse
my
own
ingratitude
,
and
consider
his
tear
as
a
reproach
that
my
soul

in

present
disturbance

could
not
bear

It
set
all

horrible

I
foam
at

<EOS>
She
guess
the
cause
of
my
disquiet

upbraid
me
gently
for
my
suspicion

give
me
such
flattering
assurance

eternal
fidelity

all

forsook

peace

at
midnight
I
leave
the
kind
nymph

her
repose

at

the
reputation

in
jeopardy

I
draw
my

my
arm

It
be
with
great
difficulty
he
could
pronounce
,
"
D
 
d
 
d
 
do
!
<EOS>
mum
 
um
 
um
 
<EOS>
murder
me
,
if
you
please
!
"
    
<EOS>
such
an
effect
have
the
cold
upon
his
jaw
,
that
his
tooth
rattle
like
a
pair
of
castanet
 
pleased
to
be
thus
undeceived
,
I
laugh
at
his
consternation
,
and
ask
what
bring
him
thither
?
<EOS>
upon
which
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
his
concern
for
me
have
induce
him
to
dodge
me
to
that
place
,
where
the
same
reason
have
detain
him
till
now
;
and
he
frankly
own
,
that
in
spite
of
the
esteem
he
have
for
Miss
Williams
,
he
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
about
me
,
consider
the
disposition
in
which
I
go
abroad
;
and
if
I
have
staid
much
longer
,
would
have
certainly
alarm
the
neighbourhood
in
my
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
the
knowledge
of
this
his
intention
confound
me
!
<EOS>
I
represent
to
him
the
mischievous
consequence
that
would
have
attend
such
a
rash
action
,
and
caution
him
severely
against
any
such
design
for
the
future
,
conclude
my
admonition
with
an
assurance
,
that
in
case
he
should
ever
act
so
madly
,
I
would
,
without
hesitation
put
him
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
a
little
patience
(
cry
he
,
in
a
lamentable
tone
)
<EOS>
your
displeasure
will
do
the
business
,
without
your
commit
murder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
touch
with
this
reproach
;
and
as
soon
as
we
get
home
,
make
it
my
business
to
appease
him
,
by
explain
the
cause
of
that
transport
,
during
which
I
have
use
him
so
unworthily
.
    
<EOS>
next
day
when
I
go
into
the
long
room
,
I
observe
several
whisper
circulate
all
of
a
sudden
;
and
do
not
doubt
that
Melinda
have
be
busy
with
my
character
;
but
I
console
myself
with
the
love
of
Narcissa
,
upon
which
I
rest
with
the
most
perfect
confidence
,
and
go
up
to
the
rowly
-
powly
table
,
win
a
few
piece
from
my
suspect
rival
,
who
with
an
easy
politeness
,
enter
into
conversation
with
me
,
and
desire
my
company
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
treat
me
with
tea
and
chocolate
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
Strutwell
,
and
guard
against
his
insinuate
behaviour
;
nor
be
my
suspicion
wrong
place
;
he
artfully
turn
the
discourse
upon
Narcissa
,
and
endeavour
,
by
hint
at
an
intrigue
he
pretend
to
be
engage
in
elsewhere
,
to
learn
what
connexion
there
be
between
her
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
his
finesse
be
ineffectual
;
I
be
convince
of
his
dissimulation
,
and
give
such
general
answer
to
his
inquiry
,
that
he
be
force
to
drop
the
subject
and
talk
of
something
else
.
    
<EOS>
while
we
converse
in
this
manner
,
the
savage
come
in
,
with
another
gentleman
,
who
introduce
him
to
his
lordship
;
and
he
be
receive
with
such
peculiar
mark
of
distinction
,
that
I
be
persuade
the
courtier
intend
to
use
him
in
some
shape
or
another
;
and
thence
<EOS>
I
conceive
an
unlucky
oman
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
more
cause
to
be
dismay
the
follow
day
,
when
I
see
the
Squire
in
company
with
Melinda
and
her
mother
,
who
honour
me
with
several
disdainful
glance
;
and
when
I
afterwards
throw
myself
in
his
way
,
instead
of
the
cordial
shake
of
the
hand
,
return
my
salute
with
a
cold
repetition
of
"
servant
,
servant
,
"
which
he
pronounce
with
such
indifference
,
or
rather
contempt
,
that
if
he
have
not
be
Narcissa
's
brother
I
should
have
affront
him
in
publick
.
    
<EOS>
these
occurrence
disturb
me
not
a
little
,
I
foresaw
the
brooding
storm
,
and
arm
myself
with
resolution
for
the
occasion
;
but
Narcissa
be
at
stake
,
I
be
far
from
be
resign
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
renounce
every
other
comfort
of
life
with
some
degree
of
fortitude
;
but
the
prospect
of
lose
her
,
disable
all
my
philosophy
,
and
torture
my
soul
into
madness
.
    
<EOS>
Miss
Williams
find
me
,
next
morning
,
full
of
anxious
tumult
,
which
do
not
abate
,
when
she
tell
me
,
that
my
Lord
Quiverwit
,
have
profess
honourable
intention
,
have
be
introduce
to
my
lovely
Mistress
by
her
brother
,
who
have
at
the
same
time
,
from
the
information
of
Melinda
,
speak
of
me
as
an
irish
fortune
-
hunter
,
without
either
birth
or
estate
to
recommend
me
;
who
support
myself
in
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
by
sharpe
,
and
other
infamous
practice
;
and
who
be
of
such
an
obscure
origin
,
<EOS>
that
I
do
not
even
know
my
own
extraction
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
expect
all
this
,
I
could
not
hear
it
with
temper
,
especially
as
truth
be
so
blend
with
falshood
in
the
assertion
,
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
separate
the
one
from
the
other
in
my
vindication
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
nothing
on
this
head
,
be
impatient
to
know
how
Narcissa
have
be
affect
with
the
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
that
generous
creature
,
far
from
believe
these
imputation
,
be
no
sooner
withdraw
with
her
confidante
,
than
she
inveigh
with
great
warmth
against
the
malevolence
of
the
world
,
to
which
only
she
ascribe
the
whole
of
what
have
be
say
to
my
disadvantage
;
and
call
every
circumstance
of
my
behaviour
to
her
,
into
review
before
her
,
find
every
thing
so
polite
,
honourable
and
disintereste
,
that
she
could
not
harbour
the
least
doubt
of
my
be
the
gentleman
I
appear
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
indeed
(
say
she
)
purposely
forbore
to
ask
the
particular
of
his
life
,
lest
the
recapitulation
of
some
misfortune
,
which
he
have
undergo
,
should
give
him
pain
:
    
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
article
of
his
fortune
,
I
own
myself
equally
afraid
of
inquire
into
it
,
and
of
discover
the
situation
of
my
own
,
<EOS>
lest
we
should
find
ourselves
both
unhappy
in
the
explanation
;
for
alas
!
<EOS>
my
provision
be
conditional
,
and
depend
entirely
on
my
marrying
with
my
brother
's
consent
.
"
    
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
with
this
intelligence
,
<EOS>
the
light
forsook
my
eye
,
the
colour
vanish
from
my
cheek
,
and
I
remain
in
a
state
of
universal
trepidation
!
 
<EOS>
My
female
friend
perceive
my
disorder
,
encourage
me
with
assurance
of
Narcissa
's
constancy
,
and
the
hope
of
some
accident
favourable
to
our
love
;
and
as
a
further
consolation
let
me
know
,
that
she
have
acquaint
my
mistress
with
the
out
-
line
of
my
life
;
and
that
although
she
be
no
stranger
to
the
present
low
state
of
my
finance
,
her
love
and
esteem
be
rather
encrease
than
diminish
by
the
knowledge
of
my
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
comfort
by
this
assurance
,
which
save
me
a
world
of
confusion
and
anxiety
:
for
I
must
have
impart
my
situation
one
day
to
Narcissa
;
and
this
I
could
not
have
do
without
shame
and
disorder
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
doubt
that
by
this
time
,
the
scandalous
aspersion
of
Melinda
be
diffuse
all
over
the
town
,
I
resolve
to
collect
my
whole
strength
of
assurance
,
to
brow
-
beat
the
effort
of
her
malice
,
and
to
publish
her
adventure
with
the
Frenchified
barber
,
by
way
of
reprisal
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
have
promise
to
be
at
the
garden
gate
about
midnight
,
Miss
Williams
take
her
leave
,
bid
me
repose
myself
entirely
on
the
affection
of
my
dear
Narcissa
,
which
be
as
perfect
as
inviolable
.
     
<EOS>
before
I
go
abroad
<EOS>
I
be
visit
by
Freeman
,
who
come
on
purpose
to
acquaint
me
with
the
infamous
story
,
that
be
raise
at
my
expence

I
hear
them
with
great
temper
,
and
in
my
turn
inform
him
of
every
thing
that
have
happen
between

among
other
thing
entertain
him
with
the
story
of
the
barber
,
let
him
know
what
share
his
friend
Banter
have
in
that
affair
:
He
be
convince
of
the
injury
my
reputation
have
suffer
,
and
no
longer
doubt
the
source
from
whence
this
deluge
of
slander
have
flow
upon
me
,
undertake
to
undeceive
the
town
in
my
behalf
,
and
roll
the
stream
back
upon
its
origin
;
but
in
the
mean
time
caution
me
from
appear
in
publick
while
the
prepossession
be
strong
against
me

lest
I
should
meet
with
some
affront
that
may
have
bad

chapter
LIX
<EOS>
I
receive
an
extraordinary
message
at
the
door
of
the
long
room
,
which
I
however
enter
,
and
affront
the
Squire
,
who
threaten
to
take
the
law
of
me
 
<EOS>
I
rebuke
Melinda
for
her
malice
 
<EOS>
She

with

<EOS>
Lord
Quiverwit
be
severe
upon
me
 
<EOS>
I
retort
his
sarcasm
 
be

with
the
utmost
tenderness
by
Narcissa
,
who
desire
to
hear
the
story
of
my
life
 
<EOS>
we
vow
eternal
constancy
to
one
another
 
<EOS>
I
retire
 
<EOS>
be
wake
by
a
messenger
,
who
bring
a
challenge
from
Quiverwit
,
whom
I
meet
,
engage
,
and
vanquish
.
  
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
advice
,
which
,
however
,
my
pride
and
resentment
would
not
permit
me
to
follow
;
for
he
no
sooner
leave
me
,
in
order
to
do
justice
to
my
character
among
his
friend
and
acquaintance
,
than
I
sally
out
,
and
go
directly
to
the
long
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
meet
at
the
door
by
a
servant
,
who
present
to
me
a
billet
without
a
subscription
,
import
that
my
presence
be
disagreeable
to
the
company
,
and
desire
I
would
take
the
hint
without
further
disturbance
,
and
bestow
myself
elsewhere
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
this
peremptory
message
fill
me
with
indignation
.
     
<EOS>
I
follow
the
fellow
who
deliver
it
,
and
seize
him
by
the
collar
,
in
presence
of
all
the
company
,
threatne
to
put
him
instantly
to
death
,
if
he
do
not
discover
the
scoundrel
who
have
charge
him
with
such
an
impudent
commission
,
that
I
may
punish
him
as
he
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
the
messenger
,
affright
at
my
menace
and
furious
look
,
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
tell
me
,
that
the
gentleman
who
order
him
to
deliver
the
letter
be
no
other
than
Narcissa
's
brother
,
who
at
that
time
stand
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
talk
to
Melinda
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
him
immediately
,
and
in
the
hearing
of
his
inamorata
,
accost
him
in
these
word
:
"
Lookee
,
Squire
,
be
it
not
for
one
consideration
that
protect
you
from
my
resentment
,
I
would
cane
you
where
you
stand
,
for
have
have
the
presumption
to
send
me
this
scurrilous
intimation
,
"
which
I
tear
to
piece
and
throw
in
his
face
;
at
the
same
time
dart
an
angry
regard
at
his
mistress
,
and
tell
her
,
I
be
sorry
she
have
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
compliment
her
upon
her
invention
,
but
at
the
expence
of
her
good
nature
and
veracity
.
 
<EOS>
Her
admirer
,
whose
courage
never
rise
<EOS>
but
in
proportion
to
the
wine
he
have
swallow
,
instead
of
resent
my
address
in
what
be
call
an
honourable
way
,
threatne
to
prosecute
me
for
an
assault
,
and
take
witness
accordingly
;
while
she
,
pique
at
his
pusilanimous
behaviour
,
and
enrage
at
the
sarcasm
I
have
utter
against
her
,
endeavour
to
make
her
quarrel
a
publick
cause
,
and
weep
aloud
with
spite
and
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
the
tear
of
a
lady
could
not
fail
of
attract
the
notice
and
concern
of
the
spectator
,
to
whom
she
complain
of
my
rudeness
,
with
great
bitterness
,
say
,
if
she
be
a
man
I
durst
not

her
so
.
     
<EOS>
the

part

the

already

be
offend
at
the
liberty
I

take

as
appear
from

though
none

them
signify
their
disgust
any
other
way

except
my
Lord
Quiverwit
,
who
venture
to
say
with
a
sneer
,
that
I
be
in
the
right
to
establish
my
own
character
,
of
which
he
have
now
no

any

<EOS>
nettle
at
this
severe
equivoque
,
which
raise
a

at

I
reply
with
some
warmth
,
"
I

the

"
 
<EOS>
He
make
no
answer
to
my
repartee

but
with
a
contemptuous
smile
,
walk
off
,
leave
me
in
a
very
disagreeable
situation
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
do
I
make
up
to
several
people
of
my
acquaintance
,
whose
conversation
,
I
hope
,
would
banish
my
confusion
;
every
body
shun
me
like
a
person
infect
,
and
I
should
not
have
be
able
to
bear
my
disgrace
,
<EOS>
have
not
the
idea
of
the
ever
faithful
and
fond
Narcissa
come
to
my
relief

<EOS>
I
quit
the
scene
of
my
mortification
,
and
saunter
about
the
town
,
happen
to
wake
from
my
contemplation
,
when
I
find
myself
just
opposite
to
a
toy
-
shop
,
which
I
enter
,
and
purchase
a
ring
set
with
a
ruby
in
the
form
of
a
heart
,
surround
by
diamond
spark

for
which
I
pay
ten
guinea

intend
it
for

the
charmer

<EOS>
I
be

at
the
hour
appoint
,
to
this
divine
creature
,
who
,
notwithstanding
what
she
have
hear
to
my
disadvantage
,
receive
me
with
the
utmost
confidence
and
tenderness
;
and
have
be
inform
of
the
general
sketch
of
my
life
,
by
Miss
Williams
,
express
a
desire
of
know
the
particular
circumstance
,
which
I
relate
with
great
candour
,
omit
however
,
some
thing
which
I
conclude
altogether
improper
for
her
ear
,
and
which
the
reader
's
reflection
will
easily
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
as
my
story
be
little
else
than
a
recital
of
misfortune

the
tear
of
sympathy
cease
not
to
trickle
from
her
inchanting
eye
,
during
the
whole
of
the
narration
,
which
when
I
have
finish
,
she
recompense
me
for
my
trouble
,
with
the
most
endearing
protestation
of
eternal
love
.
 
<EOS>
She
bewail
her
restricted
condition
,
as
it
be
the
mean
of
retard
my
happiness
;
tell
me
,
that
Lord
Quiverwit
,
by
her
brother
's
permission
,
have
be
to
drink
tea
with
her
that
very
afternoon
,
and
actually
propose
marriage
;
and
see
me
extremely
affected
with
this
piece
of
information

offer
to
give
me
a
convincing
proof
of
her
affection
,
by
espouse
me
in
private
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
fate
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
penetrate
with
this
instance
of
her
regard
,
but
that
I
may
not
be
outdo
in
generosity
,
resist
the
bewitching
temptation
,
in
consideration
of
her
honour
and
interest
;
at
the
same
time
,
present
my
ring
as
a
pledge
of
my
inviolable
attachment
,
and
on
my
knee
,
implore
heaven
to
shower
its
curse
on
my
head
,
if
ever
my
heart
should
entertain
<EOS>
one
thought
unworthy
of
the
passion
that
I
then
avow
.
 
<EOS>
She
receive
my
token
,
give
me
in
return
her
picture
in
miniature
,
exquisitely
draw
and
set
in
gold
;
and
in
the
same
posture
call
heaven
to
witness
and
to
judge
her
flame
.
 
<EOS>
Our
vow
thus
reciprocally
breathe
,
a
confidence
of
hope
ensue
,
and
our
mutual
fondness
become
as
intimate
as
innocence
would
allow
,
I
grow
insensible
of
the
progress
of
time
,
and
it
be
morning
before
I
could
tear
myself
from
this
darling
of
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
My
good
angel
foresaw
what
would
happen
,
and
prompt
me
to
indulge
myself
on
this
occasion
,
in
consideration
of
the
fatal
absence
I
be
doom
to
suffer
.
    
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
immediately
on
my
return
to
my
lodging
,
and
have
sleep
about
two
hour
,
be
wake
by
Strap
,
who
,
in
great
confusion
,
tell
me
,
there
be
a
footman
below
with
a
letter
for
me
,
which
he
would
deliver
to
no
body
but
myself
.
 
<EOS>
alarm
at
this
piece
of
news
,
I
desire
my
friend
to
shew
him
up
to
my
chamber
,
and
receive
a
letter
from
him
,
which
,
he
say
,
require
an
immediate
answer
:
upon
which
I
open
it
,
and
read
    
"
SIR
,
when
any
man
injure
my
honour
,
let
the
difference
of
rank
between
us
be
ever
so
great
,
I
be
content
to
wave
the
privilege
of
my
quality
,
and
seek
reparation
from
him
on
equal
term
.
 
<EOS>
the
insolence
of
your
reply
to
me
yesterday
,
in
the
long
-
room
,
I
may
have
overlook
,
have
not
your
presumptive
emulation
in
a
much
more
interesting
affair
,
and
a
discovery
which
I
make
this
morning
,
concur
in
persuade
me
to
chastise
your
audacity
with
my
sword
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
therefore
,
have
spirit
enough
to
support
the
character
you
assume
,
you
will
not
fail
to
follow
the
bearer
immediately
to
a
convenient
place
,
where
you
shall
be
meet
by
"
Quiverwit
.
"
    
<EOS>
whether
I
be
enervate
by
the
love
and
favour
of
Narcissa
,
or
awe
by
the
superior
station
of
my
antagonist
,
I
know
not
,
but
I
never
have
less
inclination
to
fight
than
at
this
time
:
    
however
<EOS>
,
find
there
be
a
necessity
for
vindicate
the
reputation
of
my
mistress
,
as
well
as
for
assert
my
own
honour
,
I
forthwith
rise
,
and
dress
in
a
hurry
,
put
on
my
sword
,
bid
Strap
attend
me
,
and
set
out
with
my
conductor
,
curse
my
bad
fortune
all
the
way
,
for
have
be
observe
in
my
return
from
my
angel
 
<EOS>
so
I
interpret
his
lordship
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
within
sight
of
my
rival
,
his
lacquey
tell
me
,
he
have
order
to
stop
;
upon
which
,
I
command
Strap
to
halt
also
,
while
I
walk
forward
;
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
my
challenger
,
before
we
should
come
to
battle
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
an
opportunity
want
;
for
I
no
sooner
approach
,
than
he
ask
with
a
stern
countenance
,
what
business
I
have
in
Mr
Tophall
's
garden
,
so
early
in
the
morning
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
my
Lord
,
(
say
I
)
how
to
answer
a
question
put
to
me
with
such
a
magisterial
haughtiness
.
 
<EOS>
if
your
lordship
will
please
to
expostulate
calmly
,
you
will
have
no
cause
to
repent
of
your
condescension
 
<EOS>
otherwise
,
I
be
not
to
be
intimidate
into
any
confession
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
room
for
denial
<EOS>
(
answer
he
)
<EOS>
I
see
you
come
out
with
my
own
eye
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
any
other
person
see
me
?
"
<EOS>
(
say
I.
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
neither
know
nor
care
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
want
no
other
evidence
than
that
of
my
own
sense
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
Pleased
to
hear
that
the
suspicion
be
confine
to
him
alone
,
I
endeavour
to
appease
his
jealousy
,
by
own
an
intrigue
with
the
waiting
-
maid
;
but
he
have
too
much
discernment
to
be
so
easily
impose
upon
,
and
tell
me
there
be
only
one
way
to
convince
him
of
the
truth
of
what
I
alledge
;
which
be
no
other
than
renounce
all
claim
to
Narcissa
upon
oath
,
and
promise
upon
honour
,
never
to
speak
to
her
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
exasperate
at
this
proposal
,
I
unsheathe
my
sword
,
say
,
"
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
title
have
you
,
or
any
man
on
earth
,
to
impose
such
term
on
me
!
"
<EOS>
He
do
the
same
,
and
make
towards
me
with
a
contract
brow
,
say
I
be
a
villain
,
and
have
dishonour
Narcissa
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
scandalous
villain
(
I
reply
,
in
a
transport
of
fury
)
who
brand
me
with
that
imputation
!
<EOS>
She
be
a
thousand
time
more
chaste
than
the
mother
who
bear
you
;
and
I
will
assert
her
honour
with
my
heart
's
blood
!
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
I
rush
upon
him
with
more
eagerness
than
address
,
and
endeavour
to
get
within
his
point
,
receive
a
wound
in
my
neck
,
which
redouble
my
rage
.
 
<EOS>
He
excel
me
in
temper
as
well
as
in
skill
,
by
which
mean
he
partie
my
thrust
with
great
calmness
,
until
I
have
almost
exhaust
my
spirit
;
and
when
he
perceive
me
begin
to
flag
,
attack
me
fiercely
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
find
himself
however
better
oppose
than
he
expect
,
he
resolve
to
follow
his
longe
,
and
close
with
me
;
accordingly
,
his
sword
enter
my
waistcoat
,
on
the
side
of
the
breast
-
bone
,
and
run
up
between
my
shirt
and
skin
,
appear
over
my
left
shoulder
:
<EOS>
I
imagine
that
his
weapon
have
perforate
my
lung
,
and
of
consequence
,
that
the
wound
be
mortal
;
therefore
determined
not
to
die
unrevenged
,
I
seize
his
shell
,
which
be
close
to
my
breast
,
before
he
could
disintangle
his
point
,
and
keep
it
fast
with
my
left
hand
,
shortne
my
own
sword
with
my
right
,
intend
to
run
him
through
the
heart
;
but
he
receive
the
thrust
in
the
left
arm
,
which
penetrate
up
to
the
shoulder
-
blade
.
     
<EOS>
disappoint
in
this
expectation
,
and
afraid
still
that
death
would
frustrate
my
revenge
<EOS>
,
I
grapple
with
him
,
and
be
much
the
strong
,
throw
him
upon
the
ground
,
where
I
wrest
his
sword
out
of
his
hand
,
and
so
great
be
my
confusion
,
instead
of
turn
the
point
upon
him
,
strike
out
three
of
his
fore
-
tooth
with
the
hilt
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
our
servant
see
us
fall
,
run
up
to
separate
and
assist
us
;
but
before
their
approach
,
I
be
upon
my
foot
,
and
have
discover
,
that
my
suppose
mortal
wound
be
only
a
slight
scratch
.
<EOS>
the
knowledge
of
my
own
safety
,
disarm
me
of
a
good
deal
of
my
resentment
,
and
I
begin
to
enquire
with
some
concern
into
the
situation
of
my
antagonist
,
who
remain
on
the
ground
bleed
plentifully
at
his
mouth
and
arm
.
 
<EOS>
I
help
his
footman
to
raise
him
,
and
have
bind
up
his
wound
with
my
handkerchief
,
assure
him
it
be
not
dangerous
;
I
likewise
restore
his
sword
,
and
offer
to
support
him
to
his
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
thank
me
,
with
an
air
of
sullen
dignity
;
and
whisper
to
me
,
that
I
should
hear
from
him
soon
,
go
away
,
lean
on
his
servant
's
shoulder
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
surprize
at
this
promise
,
which
I
construe
into
a
threat
,
and
resolve
,
if
ever
he
should
call
me
out
again
,
to
use
whatever
advantage
fortune
may
give
me
over
him
,
in
another
manner
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
have
leisure
to
take
notice
of
Strap
,
who
seem
quite
stupifie
with
horror
;
and
(
after
have
recover
him
from
his
exstasy
,
with
an
assurance
that
I
have
receive
no
damage
)
to
explain
the
nature
of
this
affair
as
we
walk
homeward
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
time
I
have
get
into
my
apartment
,
I
find
the
wound
in
my
neck
stiff
and
uneasy
,
and
a
good
deal
of
clot
blood
run
down
upon
my
shirt
:
upon
which
I
pull
off
my
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
unbutton
my
collar
,
that
I
may
dress
it
with
more
ease
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
no
sooner
perceive
my
shirt
quite
dyed
with
blood
,
than
imagine
I
have
get
at
least
twenty
dreadful
wound
,
he
cry
,
"
o
Jesus
!
"
and
fall
flat
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
I
stopt
the
bleeding
with
a
little
dry
lint
,
and
apply
a
plaister
over
it
,
clean
myself
from
the
gore
,
shift
and
dress
,
while
he
lie
senseless
at
my
foot
;
so
that
when
he
recover
,
and
see
me
perfectly
well
,
he
could
scarce
believe
his
own
eye
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
the
danger
be
past
,
I
be
very
well
pleased
with
what
have
happen
,
which
I
do
not
doubt
,
would
soon
become
known
,
and
consequently
dignify
my
character
not
a
little
in
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
also
proud
of
have
shew
myself
,
in
some
shape
,
worthy
of
the
love
of
Narcissa
,
who
,
I
be
persuade
<EOS>
,
would
not
think
the
bad
of
me
for
what
I
have
do
.

CHAPTER
LX
<EOS>
I
be
visit
by
Freeman
,
with
whom
I
appear
in
public
,
and
be
carresse
 
I
be
send
for
by
Lord
Quiverwit
,
whose
presence
I
quit
in
a
passion
 
<EOS>
Narcissa
be
carry
off
by
her
brother
 
<EOS>
I
intend
to
pursue
him
,
and
be
dissuade
by
my
friend
 
<EOS>
I
engage
in
play
,
and
lose
all
my
money
 
set
out
for
London
 
try
my
fortune
at
the
gaming
-
table
,
without
success
 
receive
a
letter
from
Narcissa
 
<EOS>
bilk
my
taylor
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
entertain
myself
with
these
reflection
,
the
news
of
this
duel
be
communicate
by
some
unknown
channel
,
spread
all
over
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
visit
by
Freeman
,
who
testify
his
surprize
at
find
me
,
have
be
tell
,
that
Lord
Quiverwit
be
dead
of
his
wound
<EOS>
,
I
have
abscond
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
cognizance
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
ask
if
people
guess
the
occasion
of
the
quarrel
;
and
understand
it
be
attribute
to
his
lordship
's
resentment
of
my
reply
in
the
long
-
room
,
confirm
that
conjecture
,
glad
to
find
Narcissa
unsuspected
.
     
<EOS>
My
friend
,
after
I
have
assure
him
that
my
antagonist
be
in
no
danger
,
wish
me
joy
of
the
event
,
than
which
,
he
say
,
nothing
could
happen
more
opportunely
to
support
the
idea
he
have
give
of
my
character
,
to
his
friend
,
among
whom
he
have
be
very
assiduous
in
my
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
strength
of
this
assurance
,
I
go
with
him
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
I
be
salute
by
a
great
many
of
those
very
person
,
who
shun
me
the
preceede
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
find
every
body
make
merry
with
the
story
of
Melinda
's
french
gallant
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
remain
in
this
place
,
I
receive
a
message
from
Lord
Quiverwit
,
desire
,
if
I
be
not
engage
,
to
see
me
at
his
house
.
    
<EOS>
Thither
<EOS>
I
immediately
repair
,
and
be
conduct
to
an
apartment
where
I
be
receive
by
his
lordship
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
be
leave
by
ourselves
,
he
thank
me
in
very
polite
term
,
for
have
use
the
advantage
fortune
have
give
me
over
him
,
with
such
moderation
;
and
ask
pardon
for
any
offence
his
resentment
may
have
prompt
him
to
commit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
willingly
,
(
say
he
)
make
you
my
friend
;
but
as
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
divest
myself
of
my
passion
for
Narcissa
,
I
be
too
well
convinced
of
your
sentiment
,
to
think
we
shall
ever
agree
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
,
therefore
,
of
send
for
you
,
in
order
to
own
candidly
,
that
I
can
not
help
oppose
your
success
with
that
young
lady
;
though
at
the
same
time
,
I
promise
to
regulate
my
opposition
by
the
dictate
of
justice
and
honour
:
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
I
think
proper
to
advertise
you
of
,
that
she
have
no
independant
fortune
,
and
if
you
should
even
succeed
in
your
address
,
you
would
have
the
mortification
to
see
her
reduce
to
indigence
,
unless
you
have
wherewithal
to
support
her
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
credibly
inform
of
your
incapacity
that
way
.
     
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
will
confess
,
that
,
urge
by
this
consideration
,
I
have
actually
send
notice
to
her
brother
,
of
the
progress
<EOS>
I
suspect
you
have
make
in
her
affection
,
and
desire
him
to
take
his
precaution
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Alarmed
and
provoke
at
this
information
,
I
tell
his
lordship
,
that
I
do
not
see
how
he
could
reconcile
that
piece
of
conduct
with
his
profession
of
open
dealing
,
and
fling
away
from
him
in
a
passion
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
walk
homeward
,
in
hope
of
hear
from
my
mistress
as
usual
by
mean
of
Miss
Williams
,
I
be
surprize
with
the
waving
of
a
handkerchief
,
from
the
window
of
a
coach
and
fix
that
pass
by
me
at
full
speed
;
and
upon
further
observation
,
I
see
a
servant
on
horse
-
back
riding
after
it
,
who
,
I
know
by
his
livery
,
belong
to
the
Squire
.
 
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
with
this
discovery
,
the
knowledge
of
my
misfortune
rush
all
at
once
upon
my
reflection
!
<EOS>
I
guess
immediately
that
the
signal
be
make
by
the
dear
hand
of
Narcissa
,
who
be
hurry
away
in
consequence
of
Lord
Quiverwit
's
message
to
her
brother
,
have
no
other
method
of
relate
her
distress
,
and
implore
my
assistance
.
     
<EOS>
Frantick
with
this
conjecture
<EOS>
,
I
run
to
my
lodging
,
snatch
my
pistol
,
and
order
Strap
to
get
post
-
horse
,
with
such
incoherence
of
speech
and
disorder
,
that
the
poor
valet
,
terrify
with
the
suspicion
of
another
duel
,
instead
of
provide
what
I
desire
,
go
forthwith
to
Freeman
,
who
be
inform
of
my
behaviour
,
come
streight
to
my
apartment
,
and
conjure
me
so
pathetically
to
acquaint
him
with
the
cause
of
my
uneasiness
,
that
I
could
not
refuse
to
tell
him
my
happiness
be
flee
with
Narcissa
,
and
that
I
must
retrieve
her
or
perish
.
<EOS>
He
represent
the
madness
of
such
an
undertaking
,
and
endeavour
to
divert
me
from
it
with
great
strength
of
friendship
and
reason
:
but
all
his
argument
would
have
be
ineffectual
,
have
he
not
put
me
in
mind
of
the
dependance
I
ought
to
have
on
the
love
of
Narcissa
,
and
attachment
of
her
maid
,
which
could
not
fail
of
find
opportunity
enow
to
advertise
me
of
their
situation
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
demonstrate
the
injury
my
charmer
's
reputation
must
suffer
from
my
precipitate
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
be
convince
and
compose
by
these
consideration
:
I
appear
in
publick
with
an
air
of
tranquility
,
be
well
receive
by
the
good
company
in
town
,
and
my
misfortune
take
air
,
condole
accordingly
;
while
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
Melinda
so
universally
discountenance
,
that
she
be
fain
to
return
to
London
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
scoff
and
censure
of
the
lady
at
Bath
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
the
hope
of
hear
from
the
darling
of
my
soul
support
my
spirit
a
little
while
,
I
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
,
when
at
the
end
of
several
week
,
I
find
that
expectation
disappoint
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
melancholy
and
despondence
take
possession
of
my
soul
;
and
repine
at
that
providence
,
which
by
act
the
stepmother
towards
me
,
keep
me
from
the
fruition
of
my
wish
,
I
determine
,
in
a
fit
of
despair
,
to
risk
all
I
have
at
the
gaming
table
,
with
a
view
of
acquire
a
fortune
sufficient
to
render
me
independant
for
life
;
or
of
plunge
myself
into
such
a
state
of
misery
,
as
would
effectually
crush
every
ambitious
hope
that
now
torture
my
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
Actuated
by
this
fatal
resolution
,
I
engage
in
play
,
and
after
some
turn
of
fortune
,
find
myself
,
at
the
end
of
three
day
,
worth
a
thousand
pound
;
but
it
be
not
my
intention
to
stop
there
,
for
which
cause
I
keep
Strap
ignorant
of
my
success
,
and
continue
my
career
,
until
I
be
reduce
to
five
guinea
,
which
I
would
have
hazard
also
,
have
I
not
be
ashamed
to
fall
from
a
bett
of
two
hundred
pound
to
such
a
petty
sum
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
execute
my
scheme
,
I
go
home
,
amazed
to
find
myself
so
much
at
ease
,
and
inform
my
friend
Strap
of
my
mischance
,
with
such
calmness
,
that
he
imagine
I
joke
,
affect
to
receive
the
tiding
with
great
equanimity
.
 
<EOS>
but
both
he
and
I
find
ourselves
mistake
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
misinterpret
my
own
stupidity
into
deliberate
resignation
,
and
he
have
reason
to
believe
me
in
earnest
,
when
he
see
me
next
morning
agitate
with
the
most
violent
despair
,
which
he
endeavour
to
alleviate
with
all
the
consolation
in
his
power
.
    
<EOS>
in
one
of
my
lucid
interval
,
however
,
I
charge
him
to
take
a
place
in
the
stage
coach
for
London
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
pay'd
my
debt
in
Bath
,
which
amount
to
thirty
shilling
only
.
 
<EOS>
without
take
leave
of
my
friend
I
embark
,
Strap
have
the
good
fortune
to
find
a
return
horse
,
and
arrive
in
town
,
without
have
meet
with
any
thing
remarkable
on
the
road
;
save
that
,
while
we
cross
Bagshot
Heath
,
I
be
seize
with
a
sort
of
inclination
to
retrieve
my
fortune
,
by
lay
passenger
under
contribution
,
in
some
such
place
.
     
<EOS>
My
thought
be
so
circumstance
at
this
time
,
that
I
should
have
digest
the
crime
of
robbery
,
so
righteously
have
I
concert
my
plan
,
and
venture
my
life
in
the
execution
<EOS>
,
have
I
not
be
deter
by

upon
the
infamy
that

<EOS>
the

I
take

of

receive
me
with
open
arm
,
in
expectation
of
have
his
bond
discharge
to
his

<EOS>
but
when
he
understand
what
have
happen
,
his
countenance
change
of
a
sudden

he
tell
me
,
with
a

peculiar

himself

he
would
put
it
out
of

to
play
him
such
another
trick

be
avenge
of
his

indiscretion
at
once

when
I
desire
him
to
explain
his
meaning
,
he
point
to
his
neck
,
raise
himself
on
his
tip

and
be
go
away
without
any
further
ceremony

when
I

him
in

demand
the

I

formerly

him

have
let
at
eighteen
-
pence
.
 
<EOS>
have
take
possession
of
this
dismal
habitation
,
I
send
for
Strap
,
and
my
thought
be
busy
in
collect
matter
of
consolation
to
that
faithful
squire
,
when
somebody
knock
at
my
door
,
which
I
no
sooner
open
,
than
a
young
fellow
enter
,
in
very
shabby
cloath
and
marvellous
foul
linnen
.
<EOS>
after
a
low
bow
,
he
call
me
by
my
name
,
and
ask
if
I
have
forget
him
.
<EOS>
His
voice
assist
me
in
recollect
this
person
,
whom
I
soon
recognize
to
be
my
old
acquaintance
beau
Jackson
,
of
whom
mention
be
make
in
the
first
part
of
my
memoir
.
 
<EOS>
I
salute
him
,
express
my
satisfaction
at
find
him
alive
,
and
condole
with
him
on
his
present
situation
;
which
,
however
,
do
not
seem
to
affect
him
much
,
for
he
laugh
very
heartily
at
the
occasion
of
our
meeting
so
unexpectedly
in
this
place
.
    
<EOS>
after
our
mutual
compliment
be
over
,
I
enquire
about
his
amour
with
the
lady
of
fortune
,
which
seem'd
to
be
so
near
an
happy
conclusion
when
I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
him
last
:
and
after
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
,
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
have
be
egregiously
bite
in
that
affair
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
that
a
few
day
after
our
adventure
with
the
bawd
and
her
b####che
,
I
find
mean
to
be
married
to
that
same
fine
lady
you
speak
of
,
and
pass
the
night
with
her
at
her
lodging
,
so
much
to
her
satisfaction
,
that
early
in
the
morning
,
after
a
good
deal
of
sniveling
and
sobbing
,
she
own
,
that
so
far
from
be
an
heiress
of
a
great
fortune
,
she
be
no
other
than
a
common
woman
of
the
town
,
who
have
decoy
me
into
matrimony
,
in
order
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
a
femme
couverte
;
and
that
,
unless
I
make
my
escape
immediately
,
I
should
be
arrest
for
a
debt
of
her
contracting
,
by
bailiff
employ
and
instruct
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
startle
at
this
intimation
,
I
get
up
in
a
twinkling
,
and
take
leave
of
my
spouse
with
several
hearty
damn
,
get
safe
into
the
verge
of
the
court
;
where
I
keep
snug
,
until
I
be
appoint
surgeon
's
mate
of
a
man
of
war
at
Portsmouth
;
for
which
place
I
set
out
on
a
Sunday
,
go
on
board
of
my
ship
,
in
which
I
sail
to
the
Straits
,
where
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
make
surgeon
of
a
sloop
that
come
home
in
a
few
month
after
,
and
be
put
out
of
commission
:
<EOS>
whereupon
I
come
to
London
,
imagine
myself
forget
and
free
from
my
wife
and
her
creditor
;
but
have
not
be
in
town
a
week
before
I
be
arrest
for
a
debt
<EOS>
her
'
,
amount
to
20l
and
bring
to
this
place
,
where
I
have
be
fix
by
another
action
since
that
time
.
     
<EOS>
however
,
you
know
my
disposition
;
I
defy
care
and
anxiety
;
and
be
on
the
half
-
pay
list
,
make
shift
to
live
here
tolerably
easy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
congratulate
him
on
his
philosophy
,
and
remembre
that
I
be
in
his
debt
,
repay'd
the
money
he
formerly
lend
me
,
which
,
I
believe
,
be
far
from
be
unseasonable
.
<EOS>
I
then
enquire
about
the
oeconomy
of
the
place
,
which
he
explain
to
my
satisfaction
;
and
after
we
have
agree
to
mess
together
,
he
be
just
go
to
give
order
for
dinner
when
Strap
arrive
.
    
<EOS>
I
never
in
my
life
see
sorrow
so
extravagantly
express
in
any
countenance
,
as
in
that
of
my
honest
friend
,
which
be
,
indeed
,
particularly
adapt
by
nature
for
such
impression
.
 
<EOS>
be
leave
by
ourselves
,
I
communicate
to
him
my
disaster
,
and
endeavour
to
console
him
with
the
same
argument
he
have
formerly
use
to
me
,
withal
represent
the
fair
chance
I
have
of
be
relieve
,
in
a
short
time
,
by
Mr
Bowling
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
grief
be
unutterable
;
he
seem
to
give
attention
without
listen
,
and
wring
his
hand
in
silence
;
so
that
I
be
in
a
fair
way
of
be
infect
with
his
behaviour
,
when
Jackson
return
,
and
perceive
the
deference
I
pay
to
Strap
,
altho
'
in
a
footman
's
habit
,
distribute
his
crumb
of
comfort
with
such
mirth
,
jollity
and
unconcern
,
that
the
feature
of
the
distressed
squire
relax
by
degree
,
he
recover
the
use
of
speech
,
and
begin
to
be
a
little
more
reconcile
to
this
lamentable
event
.
     
<EOS>
We
dine
together
on
boil
beef
and
green
,
bring
from
a
cook
's
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
:
and
altho
'
this
meal
be
serve
up
in
a
manner
<EOS>
little
corresponding
with
the
sphere
of
life
in
which
I
have
lately
live
<EOS>
,
I
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
eat
with
good
appetite
,
and
treat
my
friend
with
a
bottle
of
wine
,
which
have
the
desire
effect
,
of
increase
the
good
humour
of
my
fellow
-
prisoner
,
and
exhilarate
the
spirit
of
Strap
,
who
now
talk
of
my
misfortune
en
Cavalier
.
    
<EOS>
after
dinner
Jackson
leave
us
to
our
private
affair
;
when
I
desire
my
friend
to
pack
up
all
our
thing
,
and
carry
them
to
some
cheap
lodging
he
should
chuse
for
himself
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
Marshalsea
,
after
he
have
discharge
my
lodging
,
for
which
I
give
him
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
likewise
recommend
to
him
the
keep
my
misfortune
secret
,
and
say
to
my
landlord
,
or
any
other
who
should
enquire
for
me
,
that
I
be
go
into
the
country
for
a
few
week
:
at
the
same
time
I
lay
strong
injunction
upon
him
to
call
every
second
day
upon
Banter
,
in
case
he
should
receive
any
letter
for
me
from
Narcissa
,
by
the
canal
of
Freeman
;
and
by
all
mean
to
leave
a
direction
for
himself
,
at
my
uncle
's
lodging
in
wapping
,
by
which
I
may
be
find
when
my
kinsman
should
arrive
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
depart
to
execute
these
order
,
(
which
,
by
the
bye
,
be
punctually
perform'd
<EOS>
that
very
night
)
<EOS>
I
find
myself
so
little
seasoned
to
my
situation
,
that
I
dread
reflection
,
and
seek
shelter
from
it
in
the
company
of
the
beau
,
who
,
promise
to
regale
me
with
a
lecture
upon
taste
,
conduct
me
to
the
common
side
,
where
I
see
a
number
of
naked
miserable
wretch
assemble
together
.
     
<EOS>
We
have
not
be
here
many
minute
,
when
a
figure
appear
,
wrapp'd
<EOS>
in
a
dirty
rug
,
tie
about
his
loin
with
two
piece
of
list
,
of
different
colour
,
knot
together
;
have
a
black
bushy
beard
,
and
his
head
cover
with
a
huge
mass
of
brown
periwig
,
which
seem
to
have
be
ravish
from
the
crown
of
some
scare
-
crow
.
 
<EOS>
this
apparition
,
stalk
in
with
great
solemnity
,
make
a
profound
bow
to
the
audience
,
who
signify
their
approbation
by
a
general
response
of
"
how
d'ye
do
,
doctor
?
"
<EOS>
He
then
turn
towards
us
,
and
honour
Jackson
with
a
particular
salutation
:
upon
which
my
friend
,
in
a
formal
manner
,
introduce
him
to
me
,
by
the
name
of
Mr
Melopoyn
.
 
<EOS>
this
ceremony
be
over
,
he
advance
into
the
middle
of
the
congregation
,
which
crowd
around
him
,
and
hem
three
time
,
to
my
utter
astonishment
,
pronounce
with
great
significance
of
voice
and
gesture
,
a
very
elegant
and
ingenious
discourse
upon
the
difference
between
genius
and
taste
,
illustrate
his
assertion
with
apt
quotation
from
the
good
author
,
ancient
as
well
as
modern
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
his
harangue
,
which
last
a
full
hour
,
he
bow
again
to
the
spectator
;
not
one
of
whom
(
I
be
inform
)
understand
so
much
as
a
sentence
of
what
he
utter
.
<EOS>
They
manifest
,
however
,
their
admiration
and
esteem
by
voluntary
contribution
,
which
,
Jackson
tell
me
,
one
week
with
another
,
amount
to
eighteen
penny
.
 
<EOS>
this
moderate
stipend
,
together
with
some
small
present
that
he
receive
for
make
up
difference
,
and
decide
cause
amongst
the
prisoner
,
just
enable
him
to
breathe
and
walk
about
in
the
grotesque
figure
I
have
describe
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
also
,
that
he
be
an
excellent
poet
,
and
have
compose
a
tragedy
,
which
be
allow
,
by
every
body
who
have
see
it
,
to
be
a
performance
of
great
merit
;
that
his
learning
be
infinite
,
his
moral
unexceptionable
,
and
his
modesty
invincible
.
     
<EOS>
such
a
character
could
not
fail
of
attract
my
regard
;
I
long
impatiently
to
be
better
acquaint
with
him
,
and
desire
Jackson
would
engage
him
to
spend
the
evening
in
my
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
My
request
be
grant
,
he
favour
us
with
his
company
,
and
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
perceive
that
I
be
not
illiterate
,
and
that
I
have
a
strong
passion
for
the
Belle
Lettres
,
acquit
himself
so
well
on
that
subject
,
that
I
express
a
fervent
desire
of
see
his
production
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
too
he
gratify
my
inclination
:
 
he
promise
to
bring
his
tragedy
to
my
room
next
day
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
entertain
me
with
some
detach'd
piece
,
which
give
me
a
very
advantageous
idea
of
his
poetical
talent
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
thing
I
be
particularly
pleased
with
some
elegy
,
in
imitation
of
Tibullus
;
one
of
which
I
beg
leave
to
submit
to
the
reader
,
as
a
speciman
of
his
complexion
and
capacity

<EOS>
I
be
wonderfully
affect
with
this
pathetic
complaint
,
which
seem'd
so
well
calculated
for
my
own
disappointment
in
love
,
that
I
could
not
help
attach
the
idea
of
Narcissa
to
the
name
of
Monimia
,
and
of
form
such
melancholy
presage
of
my
passion
,
that
I
could
not
recover
my
tranquility
;
and
be
fain
to
have
recourse
to
the
bottle
,
which
prepare
me
for
a
profound
sleep
that
I
would
not
otherwise
have
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
whether
these
impression
invite
and
introduce
a
train
of
other
melancholy
reflection
,
or
my
fortitude
be
all
exhaust
in
the
effort
I
make
against
despondence
,
the
first
day
of
my
imprisonment
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
determine
;
but
I
awake
in
the
horror
,
and
find
my
imagination
haunt
with
such
dismal
apparition
,
that
I
be
ready
to
despair
:
 
and
believe
the
reader
will
own
,
that
I
have
no
great
cause
to
congratulate
myself
,
when
I
consider
my
situation
.

I
be
interrupt
in
the

of
these
gloomy
apprehension
by
the
arrival
of

who
contribute
not

to

let

know

by
which

he

considerable
expence

chapter
<EOS>
LXII
I
read
Melopogn
's
tragedy
,
and
conceive
a
vast
opinion
of
his
genius
 
<EOS>
he
recount
his
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
eat
our
breakfast
together
,
I
acquaint
him
with
the
character
and
condition
of
the
poet
,
who
come
in
with
his
play
at
that
instant
,
and
imagine
we
be
engage
about
business
,
could
not
be
prevail
upon
to
sit
;
but
leave
his
performance
,
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
's
tender
heart
be
melt
at
the
sight
of
a
gentleman
and
Christian
(
for
he
have
a
great
veneration
for
both
these
epithit
)
in
such
misery
;
and
assent
with
great
chearfulness
to
a
proposal
I
make
of
cloathe
him
with
our
superfluity
;
a
task
with
which
he
charge
himself
,
and
depart
immediately
to
perform
it
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
go
,
than
I
lock
my
door
and
sit
down
to
the
tragedy
,
which
I
read
to
the
end
with
vast
pleasure
,
not
a
little
amazed
at
the
conduct
of
the
manager
who
have
reject
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
fable
,
in
my
opinion
be
well
choose
,
and
naturally
conduct
,
<EOS>
the
incident
interesting
,
the
character
beautifully
contrast
,
strongly
marked
,
and
well
support
;
the
diction
poetical
,
spirited
and
correct
;
the
unity
of
the
drama
maintain
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactness
;
the
open
gradual
and
engaging
;
the
peripeteiai
surprizing
,
and
the
catastrophe
affect
:
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
judge
it
by
the
law
of
Aristotle
and
Horace
,
and
could
find
nothing
in
it
exceptionable
,
but
a
little
too
much
embellishment
in
some
few
place
,
which
objection
he
remove
to
my
satisfaction
,
by
a
quotation
from
Aristotle
's
poetic
,
import
,
that
the
least
interesting
part
of
a
poem
ought
to

<EOS>
I
revere
his
genius
,
and
be
seize
with
an
eager
curiosity
to
know
the
particular
event
of
a
fortune
so
unworthy
of
his
merit
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
Strap
return
with
a
bundle
of
cloath
,
which
I
send
with
my
compliment
to
Mr
Melopoyn
,
as
a
small
token
of
my
regard
,
and
desire
the
favour
of
his
company
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
accept
my
present
and
invitation
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
make
his
appearance
in
a
decent
dress
,
which
alter
his
figure
very
much
to
his
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
perceive
by
his
countenance
,
that
his
heart
be
big
with
gratitude
,
and
endeavour
to
prevent
his
acknowledgment
,
by
ask
pardon
for
the
liberty
I
have
take
;
he
make
no
reply
,
but
with
an
aspect
full
of
admiration
and
esteem
,
bow
to
the
ground
,
while
the
tear
gush
from
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
affect
with
these
symptom
of
an
ingenuous
mind
,
I
shift
the
conversation
from
this
subject
,
and
compliment
him
on
his
performance
,
which
I
assure
him
,
afford
me
infinite
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
My
approbation
make
him
happy
;
dinner
be
serve
,
and
Jackson
arrive
,
I
beg
their
permission
for
Strap
to
sit
at
table
with
us
,
after
have
inform
them
,
that
he
be
a
person
to
whom
I
be
extremely
obliged
;
they
be
kind
enough
to
grant
that
favour
,
and
we
eat
together
with
great
harmony
and
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
Our
meal
be
end
,
I
express
my
wonder
at
the
little
regard
Mr
Melopoyn
have
meet
with
from
the
world
;
and
signify
a
desire
of
hear
how
he
have
be
treat
by
the
manager
of
the
play
-
house
,
to
whom
,
I
understand
from
Jackson
,
he
have
offer
his
tragedy
,
without
success
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
so
little
entertaining
in
the
incident
of
my
life
(
say
he
)
that
I
be
sure
the
recital
will
not
recompence
your
attention
;
but
since
you
discover
an
inclination
to
know
them
,
I
understand
my
duty
too
well
to
disappoint
your
desire
.

<EOS>
My
father
,
who
be
a
curate
in
the
country
,
be
by
the
narrowness
of
his
circumstance
,
hindre
from
maintain
me
at
the
university
,
take
the
charge
of
my
education
upon
himself
,
and
labour
with
such
industry
and
concern
in
the
undertaking
,
that
I
have
little
cause
to
regret
the
want
of
publick
master
.
 
<EOS>
be
at
great
pain
to
consult
my
natural
byass
<EOS>
,
he
discover
in
me
betime
,
an
inclination
for
poetry
;
upon
which
he
recommend
to
me
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
classick
,
in
the
cultivation
of
which
,
he
assist
me
with
paternal
zeal
and
uncommon
erudition
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
think
me
sufficiently
acquaint
with
the
ancient
,
he
direct
my
study
to
the
good
modern
author
,
french
and
italian
as
well
as
English
,
and
lay
a
particular
injunction
upon
me
,
to
make
myself
master
of
my
mother
tongue
.
    
<EOS>
about
the
age
of
eighteen
,
I
grow
ambitious
of
undertake
a
work
of
some
consequence
;
and
with
my
father
's
approbation
,
actually
plan
the
tragedy
you
have
read
;
but
before
I
have
finish
four
act
,
that
indulgent
parent
die
,
and
leave
my
mother
and
me
in
very
indigent
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
a
near
relation
compassionate
our
distress
,
take
us
into
his
family
,
where
I
bring
my
fable
to
a
conclusion
;
and
soon
after
,
my
mother
quit
this
life
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
sorrow
for
this
melancholy
event
have
subside
,
I
tell
my
kinsman
,
who
be
a
farmer
,
that
have
pay
my
last
duty
to
my
parent
,
I
have
now
no
attachment
to
detain
me
in
the
country
,
and
therefore
be
resolve
to
set
out
for
London
,
and
offer
my
play
to
the
stage
,
where
I
do
not
doubt
of
acquire
a
large
share
of
fame
as
well
as
fortune
;
in
which
case
I
should
not
be
unmindful
of
my
friend
and
benefactor
.
 
<EOS>
My
cousin
be
ravish
with
the
prospect
of
my
felicity
,
and
willingly
contribute
towards
the
expence
of
fit
me
out
for
my
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
take
a
place
in
the
waggon
,
and
arrive
in
town
,
where
I
hire
an
apartment
in
a
garret
,
willing
to
live
as
frugally
as
possible
,
until
I
should
know
what
I
have
to
expect
from
the
manager
,
to
whom
I
intend
to
offer
my
play
.
 
<EOS>
for
though
I
look
upon
myself
as
perfectly
secure
of
a
good
reception
,
imagine
that
a
patentee
would
be
as
eager
to
receive
,
as
I
to
present
my
production
;
I
do
not
know
whether
or
not
he
may
be
pre
-
engaged
in
favour
of
another
author
,
which
would
certainly
retard
my
success
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
consideration
too
,
I
determine
to
be
speedy
in
my
application
,
and
even
to
wait
upon
one
of
the
manager
,
the
very
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
I
enquire
of
my
landlord
,
if
he
know
where
either
,
or
both
of
them
live
;
and
he
be
curious
to
know
my
business
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
appear
to
be
a
very
honest
friendly
man
(
a
tallow
-
chandler
)
<EOS>
I
make
him
acquainted
with
my
design
;
upon
which
he
tell
me
,
that
I
go
the
wrong
way
to
work
;
that
I
would
not
find
such
easy
access
to
a
manager
as
I
imagine
;
and
that
if
I
deliver
my
performance
without
proper
recommendation
,
it
would
be
as
one
to
a
thousand
<EOS>
if
ever
it
should
be
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
take
my
advice
(
say
he
)
and
your
business
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
patentee
be
a
good
catholick
,
as
I
be
,
and
use
the
same
father
who
confess
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
you
acquaint
with
this
good
priest
,
who
be
an
excellent
scholar
,
and
if
he
shall
approve
of
your
play
,
his
recommendation
will
go
a
great
way
in
determine
Mr
Supple
to
bring
it
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
applaud
his
expedient
,
and
be
introduce
to
the
friar
,
who
have
peruse
the
tragedy
,
be
pleased
to
signify
his
approbation
,
and
commend
me
in
particular
,
for
have
avoid
all
reflection
upon
religion
.
 
<EOS>
He
promise
to
use
all
his
influence
with
his
son
Supple
,
in
my
behalf
,
and
to
inform
himself
that
very
day
,
when
it
would
be
proper
for
me
to
wait
upon
him
with
the
piece
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
punctual
in
perform
his
engagement
,
and
next
morning
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
have
mention
my
affair
to
the
manager
,
and
that
I
have
no
more
to
do
,
than
to
go
to
his
house
any
time
in
the
forenoon
,
and
make
use
of
his
name
,
upon
which
I
would
find
immediate
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
his
advice
,
put
my
performance
in
my
bosom
,
and
have
receive
direction
,
go
immediately
to
the
house
of
Mr
Supple
,
and
knock
at
the
door
,
that
have
a
wicket
in
the
middle
,
face
with
a
net
-
work
of
iron
,
through
which
a
servant
have
view
me
some
time
,
demand
to
know
my
business
.
     
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
my
business
be
with
Mr
Supple
,
and
that
I
come
from
Mr
O
Varnish
.
 
<EOS>
He
examine
my
appearance
once
more
,
then
go
away
,
return
in
a
few
minute
,
and
say
his
master
be
busy
and
could
not
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
be
a
little
mortify
at
my
disappointment
,
I
be
persuade
that
my
reception
be
owe
to
Mr
Supple
's
ignorance
of
my
errand
;
and
that
I
may
meet
with
no
more
obstruction
of
the
same
kind
,
I
desire
Mr
O
Varnish
to
be
my
introductor
the
next
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
comply
with
my
request
,
and
obtain
immediate
admittance
to
the
manager
,
who
receive
me
with
the
utmost
civility
,
and
promise
to
read
my
play
with
the
first
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
by
his
own
appointment
I
call
again
in
a
fortnight
,
but
he
be
go
out
;
I
return
in
a
week
after
,
and
the
poor
gentleman
be
extremely
ill
;
I
renew
my
visit
in
a
fortnight
after
that
,
and
he
assure
me
,
he
have
be
so
much
fatigue
with
business
,
that
he
have
not
be
able
as
yet
to
read
it
to
an
end
;
but
he
would
take
the
first
opportunity
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
observe
,
that
what
he
have
yet
see
of
it
be
very
entertaining
.
 
<EOS>
I
comfort
myself
with
this
declaration
a
few
week
longer
,
at
the
end
of
which
I
appear
again
before
his
wicket
,
be
let
in
,
and
find
him
lay
up
with
the
gout
.
    
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
enter
his
chamber
,
than
look
at
me
with
a
languish
eye
,
he
pronounce
,
"
Mr
Melopoyn
,
I
be
heartily
sorry
for
an
accident
that
have
happen
during
my
illness
 
you
must
know
,
that
my
eld
boy
,
find
your
manuscript
upon
the
table
,
in
the
dining
-
room
,
where
I
use
to
read
it
,
carry
it
into
the
kitchen
,
and
leave
it
there
,
a
negligent
wench
of
a
cook
maid
,
mistake
it
for
wastepaper
,
have
expend
it
all
but
a
few
leave
in
singe
foul
upon
the
spit
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
the
misfortune
be
not
irreparable
,
since
,
no
doubt
,
you
have
several
copy
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
protest
to
you
,
my
good
friend
Mr
Random
,
I
be
extremely
shocked
at
this
information
!
<EOS>
but
the
good
-
natured
gentleman
seem
to
be
so
much
affected
with
my
misfortune
,
that
I
suppress
my
concern
,
and
tell
him
,
that
altho
'
I
have
not
another
copy
,
I
should
be
able
to
retrieve
the
loss
by
write
another
from
my
memory
,
which
be
very
tenacious
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
how
well
pleased
Mr
Supple
be
at
this
assurance
;
he
beg
I
would
set
about
it
immediately
,
and
carefully
revolve
and
recollect
every
circumstance
,
before
I
pretend
to
commit
it
to
paper
,
that
it
may
be
the
same
individual
play
that
he
have
peruse
.
 
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
injunction
,
which
plainly
demonstrate
how
much
he
interest
himself
in
the
affair
,
I
task
my
remembrance
and
industry
,
and
in
three
week
produce
the
exact
image
of
the
former
,
which
be
convey
to
him
by
my
good
friend
,
father
O
Varnish
,
who
let
me
know
next
day
,
that
Mr
Supple
would
revise
it
superficially
,
in
order
to
judge
of
its
sameness
with
the
other
,
and
then
give
his
final
answer
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
examination
I
allot
a
week
;
and
in
full
confidence
of
see
it
act
in
a
little
while
,
demand
an
audience
of
the
manager
,
when
that
term
be
expire
.
     
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
the
season
have
slipt
away
insensibly
;
he
convince
me
,
that
if
my
play
have
be
put
into
rehearsal
at
that
time
,
it
could
not
have
be
ready
for
perform
,
until
the
end
of
March
,
when
the
benefit
night
come
on
;
consequently
it
would
have
interfere
with
the
interest
of
the
player
,
whom
it
be
not
my
business
to
disoblige
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
fain
to
acquiesce
in
these
reason
,
which
to
be
sure
be
extremely
just
;
and
to
reserve
my
performance
to
the
next
season
,
when
he
hope
I
would
not
be
so
unlucky
.
 
<EOS>
although
it
be
a
grievous
disappointment
to
me
,
who
by
this
time
,
begin
to
want
both
money
and
necessary
;
have
,
on
the
strength
of
my
expectation
from
the
theatre
,
launch
out
into
some
extravagancy
,
by
which
the
sum
I
bring
to
town
be
already
almost
consume
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
at
this
circumstance
of
my
conduct
:
for
my
finance
be
sufficient
,
with
good
oeconomy
,
to
have
maintain
me
comfortably
a
whole
year
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
perhaps
be
amazed
when
I
tell
you
,
that
in
six
month
,
I
expend
not
a
farthe
less
than
ten
guinea
:
<EOS>
but
when
one
consider
the
temptation
to
which
a
young
man
be
expose
in
this
great
city
,
especially
if
he
be
addict
to
pleasure
as
I
be
,
the
wonder
will
vanish
,
or
at
least
abate
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
the
cause
of
my
concern
limit
to
my
own
situation
entirely
:
I
have
write
an
account
of
my
good
reception
to
my
kinsman
the
farmer
,
and
desire
him
to
depend
upon
me
for
the
money
he
have
kindly
accommodate
me
with
,
about
the
end
of
February
:
which
promise
I
now
find
myself
unable
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
remedy
but
patience
<EOS>
:
I
apply
to
my
landlord
,
who
be
a
very
good
-
natured
man
,
candidly
own
my
distress
,
and
beg
his
advice
in
lay
down
some
plan
for
my
subsistence
.
     
<EOS>
He
readily
promise
to
consult
his
confessor
on
this
subject
,
and
in
the
mean
time
,
tell
me
,
I
be
welcome
to
lodge
and
board
with
him
,
until
fortune
should
put
it
in
my
power
to
make
restitution
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
O
Varnish
be
inform
of
my
necesty
,
offer
to
introduce
me
to
the
author
of
a
weekly
paper
,
who
,
he
do
not
doubt
,
would
employ
me
in
that
way
,
provide
he
should
find
me
duly
qualified
;
but
upon
enquiry
,
I
understand
,
that
this
journal
be
calculate
to
foment
division
in
the
commonwealth
,
and
therefore
I
desire
to
be
excuse
from
engage
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
propose
that
I
should
write
something
in
the
poetical
way
,
which
I
may
dispose
of
to
a
bookseller
for
a
pretty
sum
of
ready
money
,
and
perhaps
establish
my
own
character
into
the
bargain
;
this
event
would
infallibly
procure
friend
;
and
my
tragedy
would
appear
next
season
to
the
good
advantage
,
by
be
support
both
by
interest
and
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
charm
with
this
prospect
,
and
have
hear
what
friend
Mr
Pope
acquire
by
his
pastoral
,
set
about
a
work
of
that
kind
,
and
in
less
than
six
week
,
compose
as
many
ecclogue
,
which
I
forthwith
offer
to
an
eminent
bookseller
,
who
desire
I
would
leave
them
for
his
perusal
,
and
he
would
give
me
an
answer
in
two
day
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
end
of
that
time
,
I
go
to
him
,
when
he
return
the
poem
,
tell
me
,
they
would
not
answer
his
purpose
,
and
sweeten
his
refusal
,
by
say
there
be
some
good
clever
line
in
them
.
     
<EOS>
not
a
little
dejected
at
his
rebuff
,
which
,
I
learn
from
Mr
O
Varnish
,
be
owe
to
the
opinion
of
another
author
,
whom
this
bookseller
always
consult
on
these
occasion
<EOS>
,
I
apply
to
another
person
of
the
same
profession
,
who
tell
me
,
that
the
town
be
cloy
with
pastoral
,
and
advise
me
,
if
I
intend
to
profit
by
my
talent
,
to
write
something
satirical
or
luscious
,
such
as
the
Button
Hole
,
Shocky
and
Towzer
,
the
Leaky
Vessel
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
this
be
a
man
in
year
,
who
wear
a
reverend
periwig
,
look
like
a
senator
,
and
go
regularly
to
church
.
 
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
I
scorn
to
prostitute
my
pen
in
the
manner
he
propose
,
and
carry
my
paper
to
a
third
,
who
assure
me
,
that
poetry
be
intirely
out
of
his
way
;
and
ask
,
if
I
have
get
never
a
piece
of
secret
history
,
throw
into
a
series
of
letter
,
or
a
volume
of
adventure
,
such
as
those
of
Robinson
Crusoe
,
and
Colonel
Jack
,
or
a
collection
of
conundrum
,
wherewith
to
entertain
the
plantation
.
 
<EOS>
be
quite
unfurnished
for
this
dealer
,
I
have
recourse
to
another
with
as
little
success
,
and
I
verily
believe
be
reject
by
the
whole
trade
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
afterwards
persuade
to
offer
myself
as
a
translator
,
and
accordingly
repair
to
a
person
,
who
be
say
to
entertain
number
of
that
chass
in
his
pay
<EOS>
,
he
assure
me
,
he
have
already
a
great
deal
of
that
work
on
his
hand
,
which
he
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
;
<EOS>
observe
that
translation
be
a
meer
drug
,
that
branch
of
literature
be
overstock
by
an
inundation
of
author
from
North
Britain
;
and
ask
what
I
would
expect
per
sheet
,
for
render
the
latin
classick
into
English
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
may
not
make
myself
too
cheap
<EOS>
,
I
determine
to
set
a
high
price
upon
my
qualification
,
and
demand
a
guinea
for
every
translated
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
guinea
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
,
stare
at
me
)
then
pause
a
little
,
and
say
,
he
have
no
occasion
for
my
service
at
present
.
     
<EOS>
I
find
my
error
,
and
resolve
to
make
amend
,
fall
one
half
in
my
demand
;
upon
which
he
stare
at
me
again
,
and
tell
me
his
hand
be
full
.
 
<EOS>
I
attempt
other
,
without
find
employment
,
and
be
actually
reduce
to
a
very
uncomfortable
prospect
,
when
I
bethink
myself
of
offer
my
talent
to
the
printer
of
half
-
penny
ballad
,
and
other
such
occasional
essay
as
be
hawk
about
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
I
apply
to
one
of
the
most
noted
and
vociferous
of
this
tribe
,
who
direct
me
to
a
person
whom
I
find
entertain
a
whole
crowd
of
them
with
gin
,
bread
and
cheese
;
he
carry
me
into
a
little
back
parlour
,
very
neatly
furnish
,
where
I
signify
my
desire
of
be
enrol
among
his
writer
;
and
be
ask
,
what
kind
of
composition
I
profess
?
 
<EOS>
understanding
that
my
inclination
lean
towards
poetry
,
he
express
his
satisfaction
,
tell
me
,
one
of
his
poet
have
lose
his
sense
,
and
be
confine
in
Bedlam
,
and
the
other
be
become
doze
with
drinking
dram
;
so
that
he
have
not
do
any
thing
tolerable
these
many
week
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
propose
,
that
we
should
enter
into
term
of
agreement
,
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
his
bargain
be
always
conditional
,
and
his
author
pay
in
proportion
to
the
sale
of
their
work
.
    
<EOS>
have
therefore
settle
these
condition
,
which
(
I
do
assure
you
)
be
not
very
advantageous
to
me
,
he
assign
me
a
subject
for
a
ballad
,
which
be
to
be
finish
in
two
hour
;
and
I
retire
to
my
garret
in
order
to
perform
his
injunction
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
theme
happen
to
suit
my
fancy
,
I
compleate
a
pretty
sort
of
an
ode
,
within
the
time
prescribe
,
and
bring
it
to
him
,
big
with
hope
of
profit
and
applause
.
    
<EOS>
He
read
it
in
a
twinkling
,
and
to
my
utter
astonishment
,
tell
me
,
it
would
not
do
;
though
indeed
,
he
own
I
write
a
good
hand
,
and
spell
very
well
,
but
my
language
be
too
high
fly
,
and
of
consequence
not
at
all
adapt
to
the
capacity
and
taste
of
his
customer
.
 
<EOS>
I
promise
to
rectify
that
mistake
,
and
in
half
an
hour
humble
my
stile
to
the
comprehension
of
vulgar
reader
;
he
approve
of
the
alteration
,
and
give
me
some
hope
of
succeed
in
time
,
though
he
observe
,
that
my
performance
be
very
deficient
in
that
quaintness
of
expression
that
please
the
multitude
:
<EOS>
however
,
to
encourage
me
,
he
venture
the
expence
of
printing
and
paper
,
and
,
if
I
remember
a
-
right
,
my
share
of
the
sale
amount
to
four
penny
half
-
penny
.
    
<EOS>
from
that
day
,
I
study
the
Grub
-
street
manner
with
great
diligence
,
and
at
length
become
such
a
proficient
,
that
my
work
be
in
great
request
among
the
most
polite
of
the
chairman
,
drayman
,
hackney
-
coachman
,
footman
and
serve
maid
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
have
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
see
my
production
adorn
with
cut
,
paste
upon
the
wall
as
ornament
in
beer
-
cellar
and
cobler
's
stall
;
and
have
actually
hear
them
sing
in
club
of
substantial
tradesman
.
 
<EOS>
but
empty
praise
(
you
know
,
my
dear
friend
)
will
not
supply
the
craving
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
in
danger
of
starve
in
the
midst
of
all
my
fame
;
for
of
ten
song
I
compose
,
it
be
well
if
two
have
the
good
fortune
to
please
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
reason
I
turn
my
thought
to
prose
,
and
during
a
tract
of
gloomy
weather
,
publish
an
apparition
,
on
the
substance
of
which
I
subsist
very
comfortably
a
whole
month
:
I
have
make
many
a
good
meal
upon
a
monster
;
a
rape
have
often
afford
me
great
satisfaction
;
but
a
murder
,
well
-
time
,
be
my
never
-
fail
resource
.
<EOS>
what
then
?
    
<EOS>
I
be
a
most
miserable
slave
to
my
employer
,
who
expect
to
be
furnish
at
a
minute
's
warning
with
prose
and
verse
,
just
as
they
think
the
circumstance
of
the
time
require
,
whether
the
inclination
be
absent
or
present
.
<EOS>
upon
my
sincerity
,
Mr
Random
,
I
have
be
so
much
pestered
and
besiege
by
these
child
of
clamour
,
that
my

become
a
burden
to

chapter
LXIII
the
continuation

conclusion
of
Mr
Melopoyn
's
story

<EOS>
I
make
shift
,
notwithstanding
,
to
maintain
myself
till
the
beginning
of
next
winter
,
when
I
renew
my
address
to
my
friend
Mr
Supple
,
and
be
most
graciously
receive
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
of
your
affair
Mr
Melopoyn
,
(
say
he
)
and
be
determine
to
shew
how
far
I
have
your
interest
at
heart
,
by
introduce
you
to
a
young
nobleman
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
be
remarkable
for
his
fine
taste
in
dramatic
writing
,
and
be
,
beside
,
a
man
of
such
influence
,
that
if
once
he
should
approve
your
play
,
his
patronage
will
support
it
against
all
the
effort
of
envy
and
ignorance
:
for
I
do
assure
you
,
that
merit
alone
will
not
bring
success
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
speak
of
your
performance
to
Lord
Rattle
,
and
if
you
will
call
at
my
house
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
you
shall
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
I
be
sensibly
touch
with
this
mark
of
Mr
Supple
's
friendship
,
and
look
upon
my
affair
as
already
do
,
go
home
and
impart
my
good
fortune
to
my
landlord
,
who
,
to
render
my
appearance
more
acceptable
to
my
patron
,
procure
a
suit
of
new
cloath
for
me
on
his
own
credit
.
    
<EOS>
not
to
trouble
you
with
idle
particular
,
I
carry
my
tragedy
to
his
lordship
's
lodging
,
and
send
it
up
along
with
Mr
Supple
's
letter
,
by
one
of
his
servant
,
who
desire
me
,
by
his
lord
's
order
,
to
return
in
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
and
be
admit
to
his
lordship
,
who
receive
me
very
courteously
,
tell
me
he
have
peruse
my
play
,
which
he
think
,
on
the
whole
,
<EOS>
be
the
good
coup
d'essai
he
have
ever
see
;
but
that
he
have
mark
some
place
in
the
margin
,
which
he
imagine
may
be
alter
for
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
transport
with
this
reception
,
and
promise
(
with
many
acknowledgment
of
his
lordship
's
generosity
)
to
be
govern
solely
by
his
advice
and
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
then
(
say
he
)
write
another
fair
copy
with
the
alteration
I
have
propose
,
and
bring
it
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
,
for
I
be
resolve
to
have
it
bring
on
the
stage
this
winter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
set
about
this
task
with
alacrity
,
and
although
I
find
his
lordship
's
remark
much
more
numerous
,
and
of
less
importance
than
I
expect
,
I
think
it
be
not
my
interest
to
dispute
upon
trifle
with
my
patron
;
therefore
new
-
modelled
it
accord
to
his
desire
,
in
less
than
a
month
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
wait
upon
him
with
the
manuscript
,
I
find
one
of
the
actor
at
breakfast
with
his
lordship
,
who
immediately
introduce
him
to
my
acquaintance
,
and
desire
him
to
read
a
scene
of
my
play
.
     
<EOS>
this
he
perform
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
with
regard
to
emphasis
and
pronounciation
;
but
he
signify
his
disgust
at
several
word
in
every
page
,
which
I
presume
to
defend
,
Lord
Rattle
tell
me
,
with
a
peremptory
look
,
I
must
not
pretend
to
dispute
with
him
,
who
have
be
a
player
these
twenty
year
,
and
understand
the
oeconomy
of
the
stage
well
than
any
man
live
.
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
submit
,
and
his
lordship
propose
the
same
actor
should
read
the
whole
play
,
in
the
evening
,
before
some
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
whom
he
would
convene
at
his
lodging
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
present
at
the
reading
;
and
I
protest
to
you
,
my
dear
friend
<EOS>
,
I
never
undergo
such
a
severe
trial
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
,
as
at
that
juncture
!
<EOS>
for
although
the
player
may
be
a
very
honest
man
and
a
good
performer
,
he
be
excessively
illiterate
and
assume
,
and
make
a
thousand
frivolous
objection
,
which
I
be
not
permit
to
answer
:
<EOS>
however
,
the
piece
be
very
much
applaud
on
the
whole
;
the
gentleman
present
,
who
I
understand
be
man
of
fortune
,
promise
to
countenance
and
support
it
as
much
as
they
could
;
and
Lord
Rattle
assure
me
,
that
he
would
act
the
part
of
a
careful
nurse
to
it
,
desire
me
to
carry
it
home
and
alter
it
immediately
accord
to
their
remark
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
fain
to
acquiesce
in
his
determination
,
and
fulfil
his
injunction
with
all
the
expedition
in
my
power
;
but
before
I
could
present
the
new
copy
,
my
good
friend
Mr
Supple
have
dispose
of
his
property
and
patent
to
one
Mr
Brayer
;
so
that
fresh
interest
be
to
be
make
with
the
new
manager
.
 
<EOS>
this
task
Lord
Rattle
undertake
,
have
some
acquaintance
with
him
,
and
recommend
my
performance
so
strongly
,
that
it
be
receive
.
    
<EOS>
I
look
upon
myself
now
,
as
upon
the
eve
of
reap
the
fruit
of
all
my
labour
:
<EOS>
I
wait
a
few
day
in
expectation
of
its
be
put
into
rehearsal
,
and
wonder
at
the
delay
,
apply
to
my
worthy
patron
,
who
excuse
Mr
Brayer
on
account
of
the
multiplicity
of
business
in
which
he
be
involve
;
and
bid
me
beware
of
teize
the
patentee
.
 
<EOS>
I
treasure
up
this
caution
,
and
exert
my
patience
three
week
longer
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
his
lordship
give
me
to
understand
that
Mr
Brayer
have
read
my
play
,
and
own
it
have
undubitable
merit
;
but
as
he
have
long
be
pre
-
engaged
to
another
author
,
he
could
not
possibly
represent
it
that
season
;
though
if
I
would
reserve
it
for
the
next
and
in
the
interim
make
such
alteration
as
he
have
propose
by
observation
on
the
margin
,
I
may
depend
upon
his
compliance
.
    
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
at
this
disappointment
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
,
for
some
minute
,
utter
one
syllable
:
at
length
,
however
,
I
complain
bitterly
of
the
manager
's
insincerity
in
amuse
me
so
long
,
when
he
know
from
the
beginning
,
that
he
could
not
gratify
my
desire
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
lordship
reprimand
me
for
my
freedom
,
say
Mr
Brayer
be
a
man
of
honour
,
and
impute
his
behaviour
with
respect
to
me
,
to
nothing
else
but
forgetfulness
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
have
have
some
reason
since
that
time
,
to
be
convince
of
his
bad
memory
;
for
,
in
spite
of
appearance
,
I
will
not
allow
myself
to
interpret
his
conduct
any
other
way
.
     
<EOS>
Lord
Rattle
observe
me
very
much
affected
with
my
disappointment
,
offer
his
interest
to
bring
on
my
play
at
the
other
house
,
which
I
eagerly
accept
,
he
forthwith
write
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
Mr
Bellower
,
actor
,
and
prime
minister
to
Mr
Vandal
,
proprietor
of
that
theatre
;
and
desire
me
to
deliver
it
with
my
tragedy
,
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
hasten
to
his
house
,
where
after
have
wait
a
whole
hour
in
a
lobby
,
I
be
admit
to
his
presence
,
and
my
performance
receive
with
great
state
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
be
extremely
busy
at
present
,
but
he
would
peruse
it
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
bid
me
call
again
in
a
week
.
<EOS>
I
take
my
leave
,
not
a
little
astonished
at
the
port
and
supercilious
behaviour
of
this
stage
-
player
,
who
have
not
treat
me
with
good
manner
;
and
begin
to
think
the
dignity
of
a
poet
greatly
impair
since
the
day
of
euripede
and
Sophocles
;
but
all
this
be
nothing
in
comparison
of
what
I
have
since
observe
.
    
<EOS>
well
,
Mr
Random
,
I
go
back
at
the
appoint
time
,
and
be
tell
that
Mr
Bellower
be
engage
,
and
could
not
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
my
visit
a
few
day
after
,
and
have
wait
a
considerable
time
,
be
favour
with
an
audience
,
during
which
,
he
say
,
he
have
not
as
yet
read
my
play
.
 
<EOS>
nettle
at
this
usage
,
I
could
contain
myself
no
longer
,
but
tell
him
,
I
imagine
he
would
have
pay
more
deference
to
Lord
Rattle
's
recommendation
,
demand
my
manuscript
with
some
expression
of
resentment
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
(
say
he
,
in
a
theatrical
tone
)
with
all
my
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
pull
out
a
drawer
of
the
bureau
at
which
he
sit
,
he
take
out
a
bundle
,
and
throw
it
upon
a
table
that
be
near
him
,
pronounce
the
word
"
<EOS>
there
,
"
with
great
disdain
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
up
,
and
perceive
with
some
surprize
,
that
it
be
a
comedy
,
tell
him
,
it
do
not
belong
to
me
;
upon
which
he
offer
me
another
,
which
I
also
disclaim
 
a
third
be
produce
,
and
reject
for
the
same
reason
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
he
pull
out
a
whole
handful
,
and
spread
them
before
me
,
say
,
"
there
be
seven
 
take
which
you
please
 
or
take
them
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
single
out
my
own
,
and
go
away
,
strike
dumb
with
admiration
at
what
I
have
see
 
not
so
much
on
account
of
his
insolence
,
as
of
the
number
of
new
play
,
which
from
this
circumstance
,
I
conclude
be
yearly
offer
to
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
do
not
fail
to
carry
my
complaint
to
my
patron
,
who
do
not
receive
it
with
all
the
indignation
I
expect
;
but
tax
me
with
precipitation
,
and
tell
me
,
I
must
lay
my
account
with
bear
the
humour
of
the
player
,
if
I
intend
to
write
for
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
now
no
other
remedy
(
say
he
)
but
to
keep
it
till
the
next
season
for
Mr
Brayer
,
and
alter
it
at
your
leisure
,
in
the
summer
,
accord
to
his
direction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
now
reduce
to
a
terrible
alternative
,
either
to
quit
all
hope
of
my
tragedy
,
from
which
I
have
all
along
promise
myself
a
large
share
of
fortune
and
reputation
,
or
to
encounter
eight
long
month
of
adversity
in
prepare
for
,
and
expect
its
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
pennance
,
painful
as
it
be
,
seem
most
eligible
to
my
reflection
at
that
time
,
and
therefore
I
resolve
to
undergo
it
.
    
<EOS>
why
should
I
tire
you
with
particular
of
no
consequence
?
    
<EOS>
I
wrestle
with
extreme
poverty
,
until
the
time
of
my
probation
be
expire
;
and
go
to
my
Lord
Rattle
in
order
to
remind
him
of
my
affair
,
when
I
understand
,
to
my
great
concern
,
that
his
lordship
be
on
the
point
of
go
abroad
,
and
,
which
be
still
more
unfortunate
for
me
,
Mr
Brayer
have
go
into
the
country
;
so
that
my
generous
patron
have
it
not
in
his
power
to
introduce
me
personally
,
as
he
intend
:
however
,
he
write
a
very
strong
letter
to
the
manager
in
my
favour
,
and
put
him
in
mind
of
the
promise
he
have
make
in
behalf
of
my
play
.
    
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
certify
of
Brayer
's
return
,
I
go
to
his
house
with
this
letter
,
but
be
tell
he
be
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
again
next
day
early
in
the
morning
,
receive
the
same
answer
,
and
be
desire
to
leave
my
name
and
business
;
I
do
so
,
and
return
the
day
after
,
when
the
servant
still
affirm
that
his
master
be
go
abroad
;
though
I
perceive
him
,
as
I
retire
,
observe
me
through
a
window
.
 
<EOS>
incense
at
this
discovery
,
I
go
to
a
coffee
-
house
hard
by
,
and
inclose
his
lordship
's
letter
in
one
from
myself
,
demand
a
categorical
answer
,
I
send
it
to
his
house
by
a
porter
,
who
return
in
a
few
minute
,
and
tell
me
Mr
Brayer
would
be
glad
to
see
me
at
that
instant
.
 
<EOS>
I
obey
the
summon
,
and
be
receive
with
such
profusion
of
compliment
and
apology
,
that
my
resentment
immediately
subside
,
and
I
be
even
in
pain
for
the
concern
which
this
honest
man
shew
at
the
mistake
of
his
servant
,
who
,
it
seem
,
have
be
order
to
deny
him
to
every
body
but
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
express
the
utmost
veneration
for
his
good
and
noble
friend
Lord
Rattle
,
whom
he
should
always
be
proud
to
serve
;
promise
to
peruse
the
play
with
all
dispatch
,
and
give
me
a
meeting
upon
it
;
and
as
a
testimony
of
his
esteem
,
make
me
a
present
of
a
general
order
for
the
season
,
by
which
I
would
be
admit
to
any
part
of
the
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
agreeable
compliment
to
me
,
whose
great
pleasure
consist
in
see
dramatic
performance
,
and
you
need
not
doubt
that
I
often
avail
myself
of
my
privilege
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
an
opportunity
of
be
behind
the
scene
when
I
please
,
I
frequently
converse
with
Mr
Brayer
about
my
play
,
and
ask
when
he
intend
to
put
it
into
rehearsal
,
but
he
have
always
so
much
business
upon
his
hand
,
that
it
remain
with
him
unopene
a
considerable
while
;
and
I
become
very
uneasy
about
the
season
,
that
waste
apace
,
<EOS>
when
I
see
in
the
paper
,
another
new
play
advertise
,
which
have
be
write
,
offer
,
accept
and
rehearse
in
the
compass
of
three
month
,
without
my
knowledge
or
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
easily
guess
how
much
I
be
confound
at
this
event
!
<EOS>
I
own
to
you
,
that
in
the
first
transport
of
my
anger
,
I
suspect
Mr
Brayer
of
have
act
towards
me
in
the
most
pitiful
,
perfidious
manner
;
and
be
actually
glad
at
his
disappointment
in
the
success
of
his
favourite
piece
,
which
by
the
strength
of
art
,
linger
till
the
third
night
,
and
then
die
in
a
deplorable
manner
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
passion
have
no
share
in
my
reflection
,
I
be
willing
to
ascribe
his
behaviour
to
his
want
of
memory
or
want
of
judgment
,
which
,
you
know
,
be
natural
defect
,
that
be
more
worthy
of
compassion
than
reproach
.
    
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
I
happen
to
be
in
company
with
a
gentlewoman
,
who
have
hear
of
my
tragedy
,
tell
me
,
she
be
acquaint
with
the
wife
of
a
gentleman
,
who
be
very
well
known
to
a
lady
,
who
have
great
interest
with
a
person
who
be
intimate
with
Earl
Sheerwit
,
and
that
if
I
please
,
she
would
use
her
influence
in
my
behalf
.
     
<EOS>
as
this
nobleman
have
the
character
of
a
Maecenas
in
the
nation
,
and
could
stamp
a
value
upon
any
work
by
his
sole
countenance
and
approbation
,
I
accept
her
offer
with
eagerness
,
in
full
confidence
of
see
my
reputation
establish
,
and
my
wish
fulfil
in
a
very
short
time
,
<EOS>
provide
that
I
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
please
his
lordship
's
taste
.
<EOS>
I
withdraw
the
manuscript
from
the
hand
of
Mr
Brayer
,
and
commit
it
to
the
care
of
this
gentlewoman
,
who
labour
so
effectually
in
my
interest
,
that
in
less
than
a
month
it
be
convey
to
the
Earl
,
and
in
a
few
week
after
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
to
hear
,
that
he
have
read
,
and
approve
it
very
much
.
<EOS>
transport
with
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
I
flatter
myself
with
the
hope
of
his
interesting
himself
in
its
favour
;
but
hear
no
more
of
the
matter
in
three
whole
month
<EOS>
,
I
begin
(
God
forgive
me
)
to
suspect
the
veracity
of
the
person
who
bring
me
the
good
tiding
,
for
I
think
it
impossible
,
that
a
man
of
his
rank
and
character
,
who
know
the
difficulty
of
write
a
good
tragedy
,
and
understand
the
dignity
of
the
work
,
should
read
and
applaud
an
essay
of
this
kind
,
without
feel
an
inclination
to
befriend
the
author
,
whom
his
countenance
alone
could
raise
above
dependance
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
long
before
I
find
my
friend
very
much
wrong
by
my
opinion
.
    
<EOS>
You
most
know
,
that
the
civility
I
have
receive
from
Lord
Rattle
,
and
the
desire
he
manifest
to
promote
the
success
of
my
play
,
encourage
me
to
write
an
account
of
my
bad
fortune
to
his
lordship
,
who
condescend
so
far
as
to
desire
,
by
letter
,
a
young
Squire
of
a
great
estate
,
with
whom
he
be
intimate
,
to
espouse
my
cause
,
and
in
particular
,
make
me
acquaint
with
one
Mr
Marmozet
a
celebrated
player
,
who
have
lately
appear
on
the
stage
with
astonish
eclat
,
and
bear
such
sway
in
the
house
where
he
act
,
that
the
manager
durst
not
refuse
any
thing
he
recommend
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
whom
Lord
Rattle
have
employ
for
this
purpose
,
be
diffident
of
his
own
interest
with
Mr
Marmozet
,
have
recourse
to
a
nobleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
,
at
his
sollicitation
,
be
so
good
as
to
introduce
me
to
him
;
and
the
conversation
turn
upon
my
performance
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
a
little
surprized
,
as
well
as
pleased
to
hear
,
that
Earl
Sheerwit
have
speak
very
much
in
its
praise
,
and
even
send
Mr
Marmozet
the
copy
,
with
a
message
express
a
desire
that
he
would
act
in
it
next
season
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
favourite
actor
backward
in
commend
the
piece
,
which
he
mention
with
some
expression
of
regard
,
that
I
do
not
chuse
to
repeat
;
assure
me
that
he
would
appear
in
it
,
provide
he
should
be
engage
to
play
at
all
during
the
ensue
season
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
he
desire
I
would
give
him
leave
to
peruse
it
in
the
country
,
whither
he
intend
to
remove
next
day
,
that
he
may
have
leisure
to
consider
and
point
out
such
alteration
as
might
,
perhaps
,
be
necessary
for
the
jeu
de
theatre
;
and
take
my
direction
,
that
he
may
communicate
by
letter
,
the
observation
he
should
make
.
<EOS>
trust
to
these
assurance
and
the
interest
which
have
be
make
in
my
behalf
,
I
hug
myself
in
the
expectation
of
see
it
,
not
only
act
,
but
act
to
the
great
advantage
,
which
I
think
could
not
fail
of
recompense
me
in
an
ample
manner
,
for
the
anxiety
and
affliction
<EOS>
I
have
undergo
:
    
<EOS>
but
six
week
be
elapse
,
I
do
not
know
how
to
reconcile
Mr
Marmozet
's
silence
,
with
his
promise
of
write
to
me
in
ten
day
after
he
set
out
for
the
country
;
however
,
I
be
at
last
favour
with
a
letter
,
import
that
he
have
make
some
remark
on
my
tragedy
,
which
he
would
freely
impart
at
meeting
,
and
advise
me
to
put
it
,
without
loss
of
time
,
into
the
hand
of
that
manager
,
who
have
the
good
company
:
for
he
himself
be
quite
uncertain
,
whether
or
not
he
should
be
engage
that
winter
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
good
deal
alarm
at
this
last
part
of
his
letter
,
and
advise
about
it
with
a
friend
,
who
tell
me
,
it
be
a
plain
indication
of
Mr
Marmozet
's
desire
to
be
rid
of
his
promise
:
that
his
pretended
uncertainty
about
act
next
winter
,
be
no
other
than
a
scandalous
evasion
;
for
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
he
be
already
engage
,
or
at
least
,
in
term
with
Mr
Vandal
;
and
that
his
design
be
to
disappoint
me
,
in
favour
of
a
new
comedy
,
which
he
have
purchase
of
the
author
,
and
intend
to
bring
upon
the
stage
for
his
own
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
dear
Sir
,
this
person
,
who
,
I
must
own
,
be
of
a
very
sanguine
complexion
,
handle
the
moral
character
of
Mr
Marmozet
with
such
severity
,
that
I
begin
to
suspect
him
of
some
particular
prejudice
,
and
put
myself
upon
my
guard
against
his
insinuation
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
crave
pardon
for
this
tedious
narration
of
trivial
circumstance
,
which
,
however
interesting
they
may
be
to
me
,
must
certainly
be
very
dry
and
insipid
to
the
ear
of
one
unconcerned
in
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
understand
the
meaning
of
your
look
,
and
will
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Sir
,
Mr
Marmozet
,
upon
his
return
to
town
,
treat
me
with
uncommon
complaisance
,
and
invite
me
to
his
lodging
,
where
he
propose
to
communicate
his
remark
,
which
I
confess
be
more
unfavourable
than
I
expect
;
but
I
answer
his
objection
,
and
,
as
I
think
,
bring
him
over
to
my
opinion
;
for
,
on
the
whole
,
he
signify
the
high
approbation
of
the
performance
.
     
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
dispute
,
I
be
not
a
little
surprized
to
find
this
poor
gentleman
's
memory
so
treacherous
as
to
let
him
forget
what
he
have
say
to
me
,
before
he
go
out
of
town
,
in
regard
to
Earl
Sheerwit
's
opinion
of
my
play
,
which
he
now
profess
himself
ignorant
of
;
and
I
be
extremely
mortified
at
hearing
from
his
own
mouth
,
that
his
interest
with
Mr
Vandal
be
so
very
low
,
as
to
be
insufficient
of
itself
,
to
bring
a
new
piece
upon
the
stage
.
<EOS>
I
then
beg
his
advice
,
and
he
counsel
me
to
apply
to
Earl
Sheerwit
for
a
message
in
my
favour
to
the
manager
,
who
would
not
presume
to
refuse
any
thing
recommend
by
so
great
a
man
;
and
he
be
so
kind
as
to
promise
to
second
this
message
with
all
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
immediate
recourse
to
the
worthy
gentlewoman
my
friend
already
mention
,
who
open
the
channel
of
her
conveyance
with
such
expedition
,
that
in
few
day
,
I
have
a
promise
of
the
message
,
provide
I
could
assure
myself
of
Mr
Vandal
's
be
uningaged
to
any
other
;
for
his
lordship
do
not
chuse
to
condescend
so
far
,
until
he
should
understand
that
there
be
a
probability
(
at
least
)
of
succeed
;
at
the
same
time
in
which
I
be
bless
with
this
piece
of
news
,
I
be
startle
at
another
,
by
the
same
canal
of
communication
;
which
be
,
that
Mr
Marmozet
,
before
he
advise
me
to
this
application
,
have
inform
the
Earl
,
that
he
have
read
my
play
,
and
find
it
altogether
unfit
for
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
could
not
doubt
the
certainty
of
this
intelligence
,
I
believe
there
be
some
misapprehension
in
the
case
;
and
without
take
any
notice
of
it
,
tell
Mr
Marmozet
the
answer
I
have
be
favour
with
;
upon
which
,
he
testify
much
joy
,
and
promise
to
ask
Mr
Vandal
the
question
propose
.
     
<EOS>
I
wait
upon
him
in
a
day
or
two
,
when
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
Mr
Vandal
have
profess
himself
free
of
all
engagement
,
he
have
put
my
play
into
his
hand
,
and
represent
it
as
a
piece
strongly
recommend
by
Earl
Sheerwit
,
who
(
he
assure
him
)
would
honour
him
with
a
message
in
its
favour
;
and
he
desire
me
to
call
for
an
answer
at
Mr
Vandal
's
house
,
in
three
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
follow
his
direction
,
and
find
the
manager
,
who
,
be
make
acquainted
with
my
business
,
own
,
that
Mr
Marmozet
have
give
him
a
manuscript
play
,
but
deny
that
he
have
mention
Earl
Sheerwit
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
inform
him
of
the
circumstance
of
the
affair
,
he
say
,
he
have
no
engagement
with
any
author
;
that
he
would
read
my
tragedy
forthwith
;
and
do
not
believe
he
should
venture
to
reject
it
in
contradiction
to
his
lordship
's
opinion
,
for
which
he
have
the
utmost
veneration
,
but
put
it
into
rehearsal
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
intoxicate
with
this
encouragement
<EOS>
,
that
I
overlook
the
mysterious
conduct
of
Mr
Marmozet
,
and
attend
the
manager
at
the
time
appoint
,
when
,
to
my
infinite
confusion
!
<EOS>
he
pronounce
my
play
improper
for
the
stage
,
and
reject
it
accordingly
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could
recollect
myself
from
the
disorder
into
which
this
unexpected
refusal
have
throw
me
,
I
express
a
desire
of
hear
his
objection
,
which
be
so
groundless
,
indistinct
and
unintelligible
,
that
I
persuade
myself
he
have
not
at
all
peruse
the
piece
,
but
have
be
prompt
by
somebody
whose
lesson
he
have
not
rightly
retain
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
be
since
inform
,
that
the
poor
man
's
head
,
which
be
not
naturally
very
clear
,
have
be
disorder
with
superstition
,
and
that
he
labour
under
the
tyranny
of
a
wife
,
and
the
terror
of
hell
fire
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
precipitate
in
this
manner
,
from
the
high
pinnacle
of
hope
,
to
the
abyss
of
despondence
,
I
be
ready
to
sink
under
the
burthen
of
my
affliction
;
and
in
the
bitterness
of
my
anguish
,
could
not
help
entertain
some
doubt
of
Mr
Marmozet
's
integrity
,
when
I
recollect
and
compare
the
circumstance
of
his
conduct
towards
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
encourage
in
this
suspicion
,
by
be
tell
,
that
my
Lord
Sheerwit
have
speak
of
his
character
with
great
contempt
;
and
in
particular
,
resent
his
insolence
in
oppose
his
own
taste
to
that
of
his
lordship
,
concern
my
tragedy
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
hesitate
between
different
opinion
of
the
matter
,
that
friend
,
who
(
as
tell
you
before
)
be
a
little
hot
-
headed
,
favour
me
with
a
visit
,
and
have
hear
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
whole
affair
,
could
not
contain
his
indignation
,
but
affirm
without
ceremony
,
that
Marmozet
be
the
sole
occasion
of
my
disappointment
;
that
he
have
act
from
first
to
last
with
the
most
perfidious
dissimulation
,
cajole
with
insinuate
civility
,
while
he
underhand
employ
all
his
art
and
influence
to
prejudice
the
ignorant
manager
against
my
performance
;
that
nothing
could
equal
his
hypocrisy
,
but
his
avarice
,
which
ingrosse
the
faculty
of
his
soul
so
much
,
that
he
scruple
not
to
be
guilty
of
the
mean
practice
to
gratify
that
sordid
appetite
;
that
in
consequence
of
this
disposition
,
he
have
prostitute
his
honour
in
betray
my
inexperience
,
and
in
undermine
the
interest
of
another
author
of
establish
reputation
,
who
have
also
offer
a
tragedy
to
the
stage
,
which
he
think
would
interfere
with
the
success
of
the
comedy
he
have
buy
,
and
determined
to
bring
on
at
all
event
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
shock
at
the
description
of
such
a
monster
,
which
I
could
not
believe
exist
in
the
world
,
bad
as
it
be
,
and
argue
against
the
asseveration
of
my
friend
,
by
demonstrate
the
bad
policy
of
such
behaviour
,
which
could
not
fail
of
entail
infamy
upon
the
author
and
the
small
temptation
that
a
man
of
Mr
Marmozet
's
figure
and
success
,
could
have
to
consult
his
interest
in
such
a
grovel
manner
,
which
must
create
contempt
and
abhorrence
of
him
in
his
patron
,
and
effectually
deprive
him
of
the
countenance
and
protection
he
now
enjoy
in
such
an
eminent
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
pretend
to
laugh
at
my
simplicity
,
and
ask
if
I
know
for
which
of
his
virtue
he
be
so
much
caress
by
the
people
of
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
(
say
he
)
for
the
quality
of
his
heart
,
that
this
little
parasite
be
invite
to
the
table
of
Dukes
and
Lords
,
who
hire
extraordinary
cook
for
his
entertainment
:
His
avarice
they
see
not
,
his
ingratitude
<EOS>
they
feel
not
,
his
hypocrisy
accommodate
itself
to
their
humour
,
and
be
of
consequence
pleasing
;
but
he
be
chiefly
court
for
his
buffoonery
,
and
will
be
admit
into
the
choice
party
of
the
quality
for
his
talent
of
mimic
Punch
and
his
wife
Joan
,
when
a
poet
of
the
most
exquisite
genius
,
be
not
able
to
attract
the
least
regard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
,
Mr
Random
,
that
I
should
credit
assertion
that
degrade
the
dignity
of
our
superior
so
much
,
and
represent
that
poor
man
as
the
most
abject
of
all
being
!
<EOS>
no
!
    
<EOS>
I
look
upon
them
as
the
hyperbole
of
passion
;
and
though
that
comedy
of
which
he
speak
,
do
actually
appear
,
I
dare
not
doubt
the
innocence
of
Mr
Marmozet
,
who
,
I
be
tell
,
be
as
much
as
ever
in
favour
with
the
Earl
;
a
circumstance
that
,
surely
,
could
not
happen
,
unless
he
have
vindicate
his
character
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
lordship
.
 
<EOS>
pray
forgive
this
long
digression
,
and
give
me
the
hearing
a
little
longer
;
for
,
thank
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
be
now
near
the
goal
.
    
<EOS>
baffle
in
all
my
attempt
,
I
despair
of
see
my
play
act
,
and
bethought
myself
of
chuse
some
employment
,
that
may
afford
a
sure
,
though
mean
subsistence
;
but
my
landlord
,
to
whom
I
be
by
this
time
considerably
indebted
,
and
who
have
lay
his
account
with
have
his
money
pay
all
in
a
heap
,
from
the
profit
of
my
third
night
,
could
not
brook
his
disappointment
,
therefore
make
another
effort
in
my
behalf
,
and
by
dint
of
interest
,
procure
a
message
from
a
lady
of
fashion
,
to
Mr
Brayer
,
who
have
always
profess
a
great
veneration
for
her
,
desire
that
he
would
set
up
my
play
forthwith
,
and
assure
him
that
she
and
all
her
friend
would
support
it
in
the
performance
:
<EOS>
to
strengthen
my
interest
,
she
engage
his
good
actor
in
my
cause
;
and
in
short
,
exert
herself
so
much
,
that
it
be
again
receive
,
and
my
hope
begin
to
revive
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Brayer
,
honest
man
,
be
so
much
engross
by
business
of
vast
consequence
,
though
to
appearance
he
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
,
that
he
could
not
find
time
to
read
it
until
the
season
be
pretty
far
advanced
;
and
read
it
<EOS>
he
must
,
for
notwithstanding
his
have
peruse
it
before
,
his
memory
do
not
retain
one
circumstance
of
the
matter
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
he
favour
it
with
his
attention
,
and
have
propose
certain
alteration
,
send
his
duty
to
the
lady
who
patronize
it
,
and
promise
on
his
honour
,
to
bring
it
on
next
winter

provide
these
alteration
should
be

and
the
copy
deliver
to
him
before
the
end
of
April

<EOS>
with
an
ache
heart
,
I
submit
to
these
condition
,
and
perform
them
accordingly
:
<EOS>
but
fortune
owe
me
another
unforeseen
mortification
;
Mr
Marmozet
during
the
summer
,
become
joint
patentee
with
Mr
Brayer
,
so
that
when
I
claim
performance
of
article
,
I
be
tell
,
he
could
do
nothing
without
the
consent
of
his
partner
,
who
be
pre

engaged
to
another
author

<EOS>
My
condition
be
render
desperate
by
the
death
of
my
good
friend
and
landlord
,
whose
executor
obtain
a
judgment
against
my
effect
,
which
they
seize
,
turn
me
out
into
the
street
naked
,
friendless
,
and
forlorn
there
<EOS>
I
be
arrest
at
the
suit
of
my

and
throw
into
this
prison

where
I

I

be
not
the

by

CHAPTER
LXIV
I
be
seize
with
a
deep
melancholy
,
and
become
a
sloven
 
<EOS>
I
be
relieve
by
my
uncle
 
<EOS>
he
prevail
upon
me
to
engage
with
his
owner
,
as
surgeon
of
the
ship
which
he
command
 
<EOS>
he
make
me
a
considerable
present
 
<EOS>
entertain
Strap
as
his
steward
 
<EOS>
I
take
my
leave
of
my
friend
,
and
go
on
board
 
<EOS>
the
ship
arrive
at
the
Downs
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
make
any
reflection
on
this
story
,
in
the
course
of
which
the
reader
must
perceive
how
egregiously
the
simplicity
and
milky
disposition
of
this
worthy
man
,
have
be
dupe
and
abuse
by
a
set
of
scoundrel
,
who
be
so
habituated
to
falshood
and
equivocation
,
that
I
verily
believe
,
they
could
not
utter
one
syllable
of
truth
,
though
their
life
depend
upon
their
sincerity
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
I
have
suffer
from
the
knavery
and
selfishness
of
mankind
,
I
be
amazed
,
and
incense
at
that
base
indifference
which
suffer
such
uncommon
merit
as
he
possess
,
to
languish
in
obscurity
,
and
struggle
with
all
the
misery
of
a
loathsome
jail
 
and
should
have
bless
the
occasion
that
seclude
me
from
such
a
perfidious
world
,
have
not
the
remembrance
of
the
amiable
Narcissa
,
preserve
my
attachment
to
that
society
of
which
she
constitute
a
part
.
 
<EOS>
the
picture
of
that
lovely
creature
be
the
constant
companion
of
my
solitude
:
how
often
do
I
contemplate
the
resemblance
of
those
enchant
feature
that
first
captivate
my
heart
!
<EOS>
how
often
do
I
weep
over
those
endear
scene
which
her
image
recall
!
<EOS>
and
how
often
do
I
curse
my
perfidious
fate
for
have
rob
me
of
the
fair
original
!
<EOS>
in
vain
do
my
imagination
flatter
me
with
scheme
of
future
happiness
;
surly
reason
always
interpose
,
and
in
a
moment
overthrow
the
unsubstantial
fabrick
,
by
chastise
the
extravagance
of
my
hope
,
and
represent
my
unhappy
situation
in
the
right
point
of
view
<EOS>
:
in
vain
do
I
fly
for
refuge
to
the
amusement
of
the
place
,
and
engage
in
the
party
of
Jackson
,
at
card
,
billiard
,
nine
-
pin
,
and
five
;
a
train
of
melancholy
thought
take
possession
of
my
soul
,
which
even
the
conversation
of
Melopoyn
could
not
divert
.
 
<EOS>
I
order
Strap
to
inquire
every
day
at
Banter
's
lodging
,
in
expectation
of
hear
again
from
my
charmer
:
and
my
disappointment
considerably
augment
my
chagrin
.
 
<EOS>
My
affectionate
valet
be
infect
with
my
sorrow
,
and
often
sit
with
me
whole
hour
without
speak
,
utter
sigh
for
sigh
,
and
shed
tear
for
tear
.
     
<EOS>
this
fellowship
increase
our
distemper
;
he
become
incapable
of
business
,
and
be
discard
by
his
master
;
while
I
see
my
money
melt
away
,
without
any
certainty
of
deliverance
,
and
in
short
,
all
my
hope
frustrated
;
grow
negligent
of
life
,
lose
all
appetite
,
and
degenerate
into
such
a
sloven
,
that
during
the
space
of
two
month
,
I
be
neither
wash
,
shift
nor
shave
;
so
that
my
face
render
meagre
with
abstinence
,
be
obscure
with
dirt
,
and
overshadow
with
hair
,
and
my
whole
appearance
squalid
and
even
frightful
;
when
,
one
day
,
Strap
bring
me
notice
,
that
there
be
a
man
below
who
want
to
speak
with
me
.
<EOS>
rouse
at
this
intelligence
,
and
in
full
hope
of
receive
a
letter
from
the
dear
object
of
my
love
,
I
run
down
stair
with
the
utmost
precipitation
,
and
find
,
to
my
infinite
surprize
,
my
generous
uncle
Mr
Bowling
!
<EOS>
transport
at
the
sight
,
I
spring
forward
to
embrace
him
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
start
aside
with
great
agility
,
draw
his
hanger
,
and
put
himself
upon
his
guard
,
cry
,
"
Avast
,
brother
,
avast
!
<EOS>
sheer
off
 
Yo
ho
!
<EOS>
you
turnkey
,
why
do
not
you
keep
a
well
look
out
?
<EOS>
here
be
one
of
your
crazy
prisoner
break
from
his
lashing
,
I
do
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
I
could
not
help
laugh
heartily
at
his
mistake
,
which
I
soon
rectify
by
my
voice
,
which
he
instantly
recollect
,
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
with
great
affection
,
testify
his
concern
at
see
me
in
such
a
miserable
condition
.
    
<EOS>
I
conduct
him
to
my
apartment
,
where
,
in
presence
of
Strap
,
whom
I
introduce
to
him
as
one
of
my
good
friend
,
he
let
me
know
,
that
he
be
just
arrive
from
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
after
have
make
a
pretty
successful
voyage
,
in
which
he
have
act
as
mate
,
until
the
ship
be
attack
by
a
french
privateer
;
that
the
captain
be
kill
during
the
engagement
,
he
have
take
the
command
,
and
be
so
fortunate
as
to
sink
the
enemy
;
after
which
he
fall
in
with
a
merchant
ship
from
Martinico
,
laden
with
sugar
,
indigo
,
and
some
silver
;
and
by
virtue
of
his
letter
of
marque
,
attack
,
take
,
and
bring
her
safe
into
Kinsale
in
Ireland
,
where
she
be
condemn
as
a
lawful
prize
;
by
which
mean
,
he
have
not
only
get
a
pretty
sum
of
money
,
but
also
acquire
the
favour
of
his
owner
,
who
have
already
confer
upon
him
the
command
of
a
large
ship
,
mount
with
twenty
nine

pounder
,
ready
to
sail
upon
a
very
advantageous
voyage
,
which
he
be
not
at
liberty
to
discover
 
<EOS>
and
he
assure
me
,
that
it
be
with
the
great
difficulty
he
have
sound
me
,
in
consequence
of
a
direction
leave
for
him
at
his
lodging
in
Wapping
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
rejoice
beyond
measure
,
at
this
account
of
his
good
fortune
;
and
,
at
his
desire
,
recount
all
the
adventure
that
have
happen
to
me
since
we
part
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
understand
the
particular
of
Strap
's
attachment
to
me
,
he
squeeze
his
hand
very
cordially
,
and
promise
to
make
a
man
of
him
;
and
give
me
ten
guinea
for
my
present
occasion
,
take
a
direction
for
the
taylor
who
arrest
me
,
and
go
away
,
in
order
to
discharge
the
debt
,
tell
me
at
parting
,
that
he
would
soon
fetch
up
all
my
lee
-
way
with
a
wet
sail
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
utterly
confound
at
this
sudden
transition
,
which
affect
me
more
than
any
reverse
I
have
formerly
feel
;
and
a
crowd
of
incoherent
idea
rush
so
impetuously
upon
my
imagination
,
that
my
reason
could
neither
separate
nor
connect
them
;
when
Strap
,
whose
joy
have
manifest
itself
in
a
thousand
foolery
,
come
into
my
room
with
his
shaving
utensil
,
and
without
any
previous
intimation
,
begin
to
lather
my
beard
,
whistle
with
great
emotion
all
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
start
from
my
reverie
,
and
be
too
well
acquaint
with
Strap
,
to
trust
myself
in
his
hand
while
he
be
under
such
agitation
,
desire
to
be
excuse
,
send
for
another
barber
,
and
suffer
myself
to
be
trim
.
 
<EOS>
have
perform
the
ceremony
of
ablution
,
I
shift
,
and
dress
in
my
gay
apparel
,
wait
for
the
return
of
my
uncle
,
who
be
agreeably
surprize
at
my
sudden
transformation
.
    
<EOS>
this
beneficent
kinsman
have
satisfy
my
creditor
,
and
obtain
an
order
for
my
discharge
so
that
I
be
no
longer
a
prisoner
;
but
as
I
have
some
reluctance
to
part
with
my
friend
and
fellow
in
distress
,
I
prevail
upon
Mr
Bowling
to
favour
us
with
his
company
,
and
invite
Mr
Melopoyn
and
Jackson
to
spend
the
evening
at
my
apartment
,
where
I
regale
them
with
a
supper
,
good
wine
,
and
the
news
of
my
release
,
on
which
they
heartily
congratulate
me
,
notwithstanding
the
loss
of
my
company
,
which
,
they
be
pleased
to
say
,
they
would
severely
feel
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Jackson
,
his
misfortune
make
so
little
impression
on
himself
,
and
he
be
altogether
so
loose
,
indifferent
and
indiscreet
,
that
I
could
scarce
pity
his
situation
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
conceive
a
veneration
and
friendship
for
the
poet
,
who
be
in
all
respect
,
an
object
much
more
worthy
of
compassion
and
regard
.
 
<EOS>
when
our
guest
withdraw
,
and
my
uncle
have
retire
,
with
an
intention
to
visit
me
next
morning
,
I
make
up
a
bundle
of
some
linnen
,
and
other
necessary
,
and
bid
Strap
carry
them
to
Mr
Melopoyn
's
lodging
,
go
thither
myself
,
and
press
it
upon
his
acceptance
with
five
guinea
,
which
with
much
difficulty
he
receive
,
assure
me
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
should
never
have
it
in
his
power
to
make
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
then
ask
if
I
could
serve
him
any
other
way
,
to
which
he
answer
,
"
You
have
already
do
too
much
,
"
and
unable
to
contain
the
emotion
of
his
soul
any
longer
,
burst
into
tear
,
and
weep
aloud
.
     
<EOS>
Moved
at
the
spectacle
,
I
leave
him
to
his
repose
,
and
when
my
uncle
return
in
the
morning
,
represent
his
character
in
such
a
favourable
light
,
that
the
honest
seaman
be
affect
with
his
distress
,
and
determine
to
follow
my
example
,
in
present
him
with
five
piece
more
:
upon
which
,
that
I
may
save
him
some
confusion
,
I
advise
Mr
Bowling
to
inclose
it
in
a
letter
to
be
deliver
by
Strap
,
after
we
should
be
go
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
accordingly
do
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
formal
leave
of
all
my
acquaintance
in
the
jail
,
and
just
as
I
be
about
to
step
into
a
hackney
-
coach
at
the
gate
,
Jackson
call
me
,
I
return
,
and
he
ask
me
in
a
whisper
,
if
I
could
lend
him
a
shilling
!
<EOS>
His
demand
be
so
moderate
,
and
in
all
likelihood
,
the
last
he
would
make
upon
me
,
I
slipt
a
guinea
into
his
hand
,
which
he
no
sooner
perceive
,
than
he
cry
,
"
o
Jesus
!
<EOS>
a
guinea
!
"
<EOS>
then
lay
hold
of
a
button
of
my
coat
,
he
break
out
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
and
when
his
convulsion
be
end
,
tell
me
,
I
be
an
honest
fellow
,
and
let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
coachman
be
order
to
drive
to
Mr
Bowling
's
lodging
,
where
,
when
we
arrive
,
he
enter
into
a
serious
discourse
with
me
,
on
the
subject
of
my
situation
,
and
propose
that
I
should
sail
with
him
in
quality
of
his
Surgeon
in
which
case
,
he
would
put
me
on
a
method
of
get
a
fortune
in
a
few
year
,
by
my
own
industry
;
and
assure
me
,
that
I
may
expect
to
inherit
all
that
he
should
die
possess
of
,
provide
I
should
survive
him
.
     
<EOS>
though
I
be
penetrate
with
a
sense
of
his
generosity
,
I
be
startle
at
a
proposal
that
offer
violence
to
my
love
,
and
signify
my
sentiment
on
that
head
,
which
he
do
not
seem
to
relish
;
but
observe
that
love
be
the
fruit
of
idleness
,
that
when
once
I
should
be
employ
in
business
,
and
my
mind
engage
in
make
money
,
I
would
be
no
more
troubled
with
these
silly
notion
,
which
none
but
your
fair
-
weather
Jacks
,
who
have
nothing
but
their
pleasure
to
mind
,
ought
to
entertain
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
pique
at
this
insinuation
,
which
I
look
upon
as
a
reproach
,
and
without
give
myself
time
to
deliberate
,
accept
his
offer
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
overjoy
at
my
compliance
,
carry
me
immediately
to
his
chief
owner
,
with
whom
a
bargain
be
strike
,
so
that
I
could
not
retract
with
honour
,
<EOS>
should
I
be
never
so
much
disposed
thereto
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
may
not
have
time
to
cool
,
he
bid
me
draw
out
a
list
of
medicine
for
a
compliment
of
five
hundred
man
,
adapt
to
the
distemper
of
hot
climate
,
and
sufficient
for
a
voyage
of
eighteen
month
;
and
carry
it
to
a
certain
wholesale
apothecary
,
who
would
also
provide
me
in
two
well
-
qualify
mate
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
thus
employ
,
Strap
come
in
,
and
look
very
blank
,
when
he
understand
my
resolution
:
<EOS>
however
,
after
a
pause
of
some
minute
,
he
insist
upon
go
along
with
me
;
and
at
my
desire
be
make
ship
's
steward
by
captain
Bowling
,
who
promise
to
be
at
the
expence
of
fit
him
out
,
and
to
lend
him
two
hundred
pound
to
purchase
an
adventure
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
have
deliver
my
list
of
medicine
,
choose
a
couple
of
my
own
countryman
for
mate
,
and
bespoke
a
set
of
chirurgical
instrument
,
my
uncle
tell
me
,
that
by
his
last
voyage
,
he
have
clear
almost
three
thousand
pound
,
one
thousand
of
which
he
would
immediately
make
over
and
put
into
my
hand
;
that
he
would
procure
for
me
credit
to
the
value
of
as
much
more
,
in
such
good
as
would
turn
to
good
account
in
the
country
to
which
we
be
bind
;
and
that
although
he
look
upon
my
interest
as
his
own
,
he
would
keep
the
remain
part
of
his
fortune
in
his
own
disposal
,
with
a
view
of
preserve
his
independance
,
and
the
power
of
punish
me
,
in
case
I
should
not
make
a
good
use
of
what
he
have
already
bestow
upon
me
.
    
<EOS>
without
trouble
the
reader
with
an
account
of
the
effect
which
this
surprizing
generosity
have
upon
my
mind
,
I
shall
only
say
,
that
his
promise
be
instantly
perform
,
and
an
invoyce
of
merchandize
proper
for
the
voyage
present
to
me
,
that
I
may
purchase
the
good
,
and
ship
them
with
all
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
hurry
the
remembrance
of
my
charming
Narcissa
often
interpose
,
and
make
me
the
most
miserable
of
all
mortal
.
<EOS>
I
be
distract
with
the
thought
of
be
tear
from
her
,
perhaps
,
for
ever
;
and
though
the
hope
of
see
her
again
,
may
have
support
me
under
the
torment
of
separation
,
I
could
not
reflect
upon
the
anguish
she
must
feel
at
part
with
me
,
and
the
incessant
sorrow
to
which
her
tender
bosom
would
be
expose
during
my
absence
,
without
be
pierce
with
the
deep
affliction
!
<EOS>
as
my
imagination
be
daily
and
nightly
upon
the
rack
to
invent
some
method
of
mitigate
this
cruel
stroke
,
or
at
least
of
acquit
my
love
and
honour
in
the
opinion
of
that
gentle
creature
,
I
at
length
stumble
upon
an
expedient
,
with
which
the
reader
will
be
make
acquainted
in
due
time
;
and
in
consequence
of
my
determination
,
become
less
uneasy
and
disturbed
.
    
<EOS>
My
business
be
finish
,
and
the
ship
ready
to
sail
,
I
resolve
to
make
my
last
appearance
among
my
acquaintance
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
where
I
have
not
be
see
since
my
imprisonment
;
and
as
I
have
,
by
the
advice
of
my
uncle
,
take
off
some
very
rich
cloath
for
sale
,
I
put
on
the
gay
suit
in
my
possession
,
and
go
in
a
chair
to
the
coffee
-
house
I
use
to
frequent
,
where
I
find
my
friend
Banter
so
confound
at
the
magnificence
of
my
dress
,
that
when
I
make
up
to
him
,
he
gaze
at
me
with
a
look
of
astonishment
,
without
be
able
,
for
some
minute
,
to
open
his
lip
;
 
then
pull
me
aside
by
the
sleeve
,
and
fix
his
eye
on
mine
,
accost
me
in
this
manner
:
"
<EOS>
Random
,
where
the
devil
have
you
be
!
<EOS>
eh
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
finery
?
 
<EOS>
Oho
!
<EOS>
I
understand
you
 
<EOS>
You
be
just
arrive
from
the
country
!
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
the
road
be
good
,
eh
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
Random
,
you
be
a
bold
fellow
,
and
a
lucky
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
but
take
care
,
the
pitcher
go
often
to
the
well
,
but
be
break
at
last
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
point
to
his
collar
by
which
gesture
,
and
the
broken
hint
he
have
ejaculate
<EOS>
,
I
find
he
suspect
me
of
have
rob
on
the
highway
<EOS>
and
I
laugh
very
heartily
at
his
supposition
.
 
<EOS>
without
explain
myself
any
farther
,
I
tell
him
he
be
mistaken
in
his
conjecture
;
that
I
have
be
for
some
time
past
with
the
relation
of
whom
he
have
frequently
hear
me
speak
;
and
that
be
to
set
out
next
day
upon
my
travel
,
I
have
come
thither
to
take
my
leave
of
my
friend
,
and
to
receive
of
him
the
money
he
have
borrow
from
me
,
which
,
now
that
I
be
go
abroad
,
I
should
have
occasion
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
disconcert
at
this
demand
;
but
recollect
himself
in
a
moment
,
swear
,
in
an
affected
passion
,
that
I
have
use
him
extremely
ill
,
and
he
would
never
forgive
me
,
for
have
,
by
this
short
warning
,
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
free
himself
of
an
obligation
he
could
no
longer
bear
.
     
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smile
at
this
pretend
delicacy
,
which
I
commend
highly
,
tell
him
,
he
need
not
be
uneasy
on
that
score
,
for
I
would
give
him
a
direction
to
a
merchant
in
the
city
,
with
whom
I
would
leave
a
discharge
for
the
sum
,
to
be
deliver
upon
payment
.
 
<EOS>
He
profess
much
joy
at
this
expedient
,
and
with
great
eagerness
ask
the
person
's
name
and
place
of
abode
,
which
he
forthwith
write
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
assure
me
,
that
he
would
not
be
long
in
my
debt
.
 
<EOS>
this
affair
,
which
I
know
he
would
never
after
think
of
,
be
settle
to
his
satisfaction
<EOS>
,
I
send
card
to
all
my
friend
,
desire
the
favour
of
their
company
at
a
tavern
in
the
evening
,
when
they
honour
my
invitation
,
and
I
have
the
pleasure
of
treat
them
in
a
very
elegant
manner
,
at
which
they
express
as
much
admiration
as
applause
.
<EOS>
have
enjoy
ourselves
till
midnight
,
I
take
my
leave
of
them
all
,
be
well
-
nigh
stifle
with
caress
;
and
next
day
I
set
out
with
Strap
in
a

Gravesend
,
where
we
go
on
board
,
and
the
wind

,
weigh
anchor
in
less
than
twelve
hour
.
 
<EOS>
without
meet
with
any
accident
,
we
get
as
far
as
the
Downs
,
where
we
be
oblige
to
come
to
an
anchor
,
and
wait
for
an
easterly
wind
to
carry
us
out
of
the

<EOS>
as
I
be
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
extent
of
the
Squire
's
estate
and
influence
,
I
halt
within
five
mile
of
his
house
,
where
we
remain
 
'
till
the
twilight
,
at
which
time
we
set
forward
,
and
,
by
the
favour
of
a
dark
night
,
gain
a
copse
about
half
a
mile
from
the
village
where
Mrs
Sagely
live
.
 
<EOS>
here
we
leave
our
horse
tie
to
a
tree
,
and
go
directly
to
the
house
of
my
old
benefactress
,
Strap
tremble
all
the
way
,
and
vent
ejaculatory
petition
to
heaven
for
our
safety
.
<EOS>
Her
habitation
be
quite
solitary
,
we
arrive
at
the
door
without
be
observe
,
when
I
order
my
companion
to
enter
by
himself
,
and
in
case
there
should
be
company
with
her
,
deliver
a
letter
which
I
have
write
for
the
purpose
,
and
say
that
a
friend
of
her
in
London
,
understand
that
he
intend
to
travel
this
road
,
have
commit
it
to
his
care
.
 
<EOS>
He
rap
at
the
door
,
to
which
the
good
old
matron
come
,
tell
him
,
that
be
a
lone
woman
,
he
must
excuse
her
,
if
she
do
not
open
it
,
until
he
have
declare
his
name
and
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
answer
,
that
his
name
be
unknown
to
her
,
and
that
his
business
be
to
deliver
a
letter
,
which
(
to
free
her
from
all
manner
of
apprehension
)
<EOS>
he
would
convey
to
her
through
the
space
between
the
door
and
threshold
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
instantly
perform
;
and
she
no
sooner
read
the
content
,
which
specify
my
be
present
,
than
she
cry
,
"
if
the
person
who
write
this
letter
be
at
hand
,
let
him
speak
,
that
I
may
be
assure
by
his
voice
whether
or
not
I
may
safely
admit
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
forthwith
apply
my
mouth
to
the
key
-
hole
,
and
pronounce
,
"
dear
mother
,
you
need
not
be
afraid
<EOS>
,
it
be
I
,
so
much
indebted
to
your
goodness
,
who
now
crave
admittance
.
"
     
<EOS>
She
know
my
voice
,
and
open
the
door
immediately
,
receive
me
with
a
truly
maternal
affection
,
manifest
by
the
tear
she
let
fall
,
her
concern
lest
I
should
be
discover
,
for
she
have
be
inform
of
every
thing
that
have
happen
between
Narcissa
and
me
,
from
the
dear
captive
's
own
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
explain
the
motive
of
my
journey
,
which
be
no
other
than
a
desire
of
see
the
object
of
my
love
before
I
should
quit
the
kingdom
,
that
I
may
in
person
convince
her
of
the
necessity
I
be
under
to
leave
her
,
reconcile
her
to
that
event
,
by
describe
the
advantage
that
in
all
probability
would
attend
it
,
repeat
my
vow
of
eternal
constancy
,
and
enjoy
the
melancholy
pleasure
of
a
tender
embrace
at
part
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
I
have
thus
signify
my
intention
,
Mrs
Sagely
tell
me
,
that
Narcissa
,
upon
her
return
from
the
Bath
,
have
be
so
strictly
watch
,
that
no
body
,
but
one
or
two
of
the
servant
devote
to
her
brother
,
be
admit
to
her
presence
;
that
afterwards
she
have
be
a
little
enlarged
,
and
be
permit
to
see
company
;
during
which
indulgence
,
she
have
be
several
time
at
her
cottage
:
but
of
late
she
have
be
betray
by
one
of
the
servant
,
who
discover
to
the
squire
,
that
he
have
once
carry
a
letter
from
her
to
the
post
-
house
direct
to
me
;
upon
which
information
,
she
be
now
more
confine
than
ever
,
and
that
I
could
have
no
chance
of
see
her
,
unless
I
would
run
the
risque
of
get
into
the
garden
,
where
she
and
her
maid
be
every
day
allow
to
take
the
air
,
and
lie
hide
until
I
should
have
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
them
 
an
adventure
which
would
be
attend
with
such
danger
,
that
no
man
in
his
right
wit
would
attempt
it
.
     
<EOS>
this
enterprize
,
hazardous
as
it
be
<EOS>
,
I
resolve
to
perform
,
in
spite
of
all
the
argument
of
Mrs
Sagely
,
who
reason
,
chid
,
and
intreate
by
turn
;
and
the
tear
and
prayer
of
Strap
,
who
conjure
me
on
his
knee
,
to
have
more
regard
to
myself
as
well
as
to
him
,
than
to
tempt
my
own
destruction
in
such
a
precipitate
manner
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
deal
to
every
thing
,
but
the
suggestion
of
my
love
;
and
order
him
to
return
immediately
with
the
horse
to
the
inn
from
whence
we
set
out
,
and
wait
for
my
come
in
that
place
,
he
at
first
peremptorily
refuse
to
leave
me
,
until
I
perswade
him
,
that
if
our
horse
should
remain
where
they
be
 
'
till
day
-
light
,
they
would
certainly
be
discover
,
and
the
whole
county
alarm
.
<EOS>
on
this
consideration
,
he
take
his
leave
in
a
sorrowful
plight
,
kiss
my
hand
,
and
weeping
,
cry
,
"
God
know
if
ever
I
shall
see
you
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
kind
landlady
find
me
obstinate
,
give
me
her
good
advice
how
to
behave
in
the
execution
of
my
project
;
and
after
have
perswade
me
to
take
a
little
refreshment
,
accommodate
me
with
a
bed
,
and
leave
me
to
my
repose
.
 
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
,
I
get
up
,
and
arm
with
a
couple
of
loaded
pistol
and
a
hanger
,
go
to
the
back
of
the
Squire
's
garden
,
climb
over
the
wall
,
and
,
accord
to
Mrs
Sagely
's
direction
,
conceal
myself
in
a
thicket
,
hard
by
an
alcove
which
terminate
a
walk
at
a
good
distance
from
the
house
,
which
(
I
be
tell
)
<EOS>
my
mistress
chiefly
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
abscond
from
five
a
-
clock
in
the
morning
to
six
in
the
evening
,
without
see
a
human
creature
;
at
last
I
perceive
two
woman
approach
,
whom
by
my
throb
heart
I
soon
recogniz'd
to
be
the
adorable
Narcissa
and
Miss
Williams
.
    
<EOS>
I
feel
the
strong
agitation
of
soul
at
the
sight
;
and
guess
that
they
would
repose
themselves
in
the
alcove
,
I
stept
into
it
unperceiv'd
,
and
lay
upon
the
stone
-
table
a
picture
of
myself
in
miniature
,
for
which
I
have
sit
in
London
,
purpose
to
leave
it
with
Narcissa
before
I
should
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
I
expose
it
in
this
manner
,
as
an
introduction
to
my
own
appearance
,
which
,
without
some
previous
intimation
,
I
be
afraid
may
have
an
unlucky
effect
upon
the
delicate
nerve
of
my
fair
enslaver
;
and
then
withdraw
into
the
thicket
,
where
I
could
hear
their
discourse
,
and
suit
myself
to
the
circumstance
of
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
advance
,
I
observe
an
air
of
melancholy
in
the
countenance
of
Narcissa
,
blend
with
such
unspeakable
sweetness
,
that
I
could
scarce
refrain
from
fly
into
her
arm
,
and
kiss
away
the
pearly
drop
that
stand
collect
in
each
bewitching
eye
.
<EOS>
accord
to
my
expectation
,
she
enter
the
alcove
,
and
perceive
something
on
the
table
,
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
she
cast
her
eye
upon
the
feature
,
than
she
startle
,
cry
,
"
Gracious
God
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
rose
instantly
vanish
from
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
Her
confidante
,
<EOS>
alarm'd
<EOS>
at
this
exclamation
,
look
at
the
picture
,
and
,
strike
with
the
resemblance
,
cry
,
"
o
Jesus
!
<EOS>
the
very
feature
of
MrRandom
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Narcissa
have
recollect
herself
a
little
,
say
,
"
whatever
angel
bring
it
hither
as
a
comfort
to
me
in
my
affliction
,
I
be
thankful
for
the
benefit
,
and
will
preserve
it
as
the
dear
object
of
my
care
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
kiss
it
with
surprising
ardour
,
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
then
deposit
the
lifeless
image
in
her
lovely
bosom
.
<EOS>
transport
at
these
symptom
of
her
unaltered
affection
,
I
be
about
to
throw
myself
at
her
foot
,
when
Miss
Williams
,
whose
reflection
be
less
engaged
than
that
of
her
mistress
,
observe
,
that
the
picture
could
not
transport
itself
hither
,
and
that
she
could
not
help
think
I
be
not
far
off
.
     
<EOS>
the
gentle
Narcissa
start
at
this
conjecture
,
answer
,
"
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
for
although
nothing
in
the
universe
could
yield
me
satisfaction
equal
to
that
of
his
presence
for
one
poor
moment
,
in
a
proper
place
,
I
would
rather
forfeit
his
company
 
almost
for
ever
,
than
see
him
here
,
where
his
life
would
be
expose
to
so
much
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
no
longer
restrain
the
impulse
of
my
passion
,
but
break
from
my
concealment
,
stand
before
her
,
when
she
utter
a
fearful
shriek
,
and
faint
in
the
arm
of
her
companion
.
<EOS>
I
fly
towards
the
treasure
of
my
soul
,
clasp
her
in
my
embrace
,
and
with
the
warmth
of
my
kiss
,
bring
her
again
to
life
.
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
that
I
be
endow
with
the
expression
of
a
Raphael
,
the
grace
of
a
Guido
,
the
magick
touch
of
a
Titian
,
that
I
may
represent
the
fond
concern
,
the
chasten
rapture
,
and
ingenuous
blush
that
mingle
on
her
beauteous
face
,
when
she
open
her
eye
upon
me
,
and
pronounce
,
"
o
heaven
!
<EOS>
be
it
you
!
"
    
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
have
already
encroach
upon
the
reader
's
patience
,
with
the
particular
of
this
amour
,
on
which
(
I
own
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
be
impertinently
circumstantial
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
omit
the
less
material
passage
of
this
interview
,
during
which
I
convince
her
reason
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
could
not
appease
the
sad
presage
of
her
love
,
with
regard
to
the
long
voyage
,
and
danger
I
must
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
spend
an
hour
(
which
be
all
she
could
spare
from
the
barbarity
of
her
brother
's
vigilance
)
in
lament
over
our
hard
fate
,
and
in
repeat
our
reciprocal
vow
,
Miss
Williams
remind
us
of
the
necessity
there
be
for
our
immediate
parting
;
and
sure
,
lover
never
part
with
such
sorrow
and
reluctance
as
we
.
<EOS>
but
because
my
word
be
incapable
of
do
justice
to
this
affect
circumstance
,
I
be
oblige
to
draw
a
veil
over
it
,
and
observe
,
that
I
return
in
the
dark
to
the
house
of
Mrs
Sagely
,
who
be
overjoy'd
<EOS>
to
hear
of
my
success
,
and
oppose
the
tumult
of
my
grief
with
such
strength
of
reason
,
that
my
mind
regain
in
some
measure
its
tranquility
;
and
that
very
night
,
after
have
force
upon
this
good
gentlewoman
a
purse
of
twenty
guinea
,
as
a
token
of
my
gratitude
and
esteem
,
I
tock
my
leave
of
her
,
set
out
on
foot
for
the
inn
,
where
my
arrival
free
honest
Strap
from
the
horror
of
unutterable
dread
.
    
<EOS>
We
take
horse
immediately
,
and
alight
early
next
morning
at
Deal
,
where
I
find
my
uncle
in
great
concern
on
account
of
my
absence
,
because
he
have
receive
his
dispatch
,
and
must
have
weigh
with
the
first
fair
wind
,
whether
I
have
be
on
board
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
a
brisk
easterly
gale
spring
up
,
we
set
sail
,
and
in
eight
and
forty
hour
get
clear
of
the
Channel
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
be
about
200
league
from
the
Land
's
end
,
the
captain
take
me
apart
into
the
cabbin
,
tell
me
,
that
,
now
he
be
permit
by
his
instruction
,
he
would
disclose
the
intent
and
destination
of
our
voyage
:
    
"
the
ship
,
say
he
,
which
have
be
fit
out
at
a
great
expence
,
be
bind
for
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
where
we
shall
exchange
part
of
our
cargo
for
slave
and
gold
dust
;
from
thence
we
will
transport
our
negro
to
Buenos
-
Ayres
in
New
-
Spain
,
where
(
by
virtue
of
passport
obtain
from
our
own
court
,
and
that
of
Madrid
)
we
will
dispose
of
them
and
the
good
that
remain
on
board
for
silver
,
by
mean
of
our
supercargo
,
who
be
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
coast
,
the
lingo
and
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
be
thus
let
into
the
secret
of
our
expedition
,
I
borrow
of
the
supercargo
a
spanish
grammar
,
dictionary
,
and
some
other
book
of
the
same
language
,
which
I
study
with
such
application
,
that
before
we
arrive
in
New
-
Spain
,
I
could
maintain
a
conversation
with
him
in
that
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
be
arrive
in
the
warm
latitude
,
I
order
(
with
the
captain
's
consent
)
<EOS>
the
whole
ship
's
company
to
be
blooded
and
purge
,
myself
undergo
the
same
evacuation
,
in
order
to
prevent
those
dangerous
fever
to
which
northern
constitution
be
subject
in
hot
climate
;
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
precaution
be
not
unserviceable
,
for
we
lose
but
one
sailor
during
our
whole
passage
to
the
coast
.
    
<EOS>
one
day
,
when
we
have
be
about
five
week
at
sea
,
we
descry
to
windward
a
large
ship
bear
down
upon
us
with
all
the
fail
she
could
carry
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
my
uncle
order
the
studding
-
sail
to
be
hoist
,
and
the
ship
to
be
clear
for
engage
;
but
finding
,
that
(
to
use
the
seamen
's
phrase
)
<EOS>
we
be
very
much
wrong
by
the
ship
which
have
us
in
chace
,
and
which
by
this
time
have
hoist
french
colour
,
he
command
the
studding
-
sail
to
be
take
in
,
the
course
to
be
clew
up
,
the
main
-
top
-
sail
to
be
back
,
the
tompion
to
be
take
out
of
the
gun
,
and
every
man
to
repair
to
his
quarter
.
<EOS>
while
every
body
be
busy
in
the
performance
of
these
order
,
Strap
come
upon
the
quarter
-
deck
,
tremble
,
and
and
looking
aghast
,
and
,
with
a
voice
half
suppress
by
fear
,
ask
if
I
think
we
be
a
match
for
the
vessel
in
pursuit
of
us
.
<EOS>
observe
his
consternation
,
I
say
,
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
be
you
afraid
,
Strap
?
"
    
<EOS>
"
Afraid
!

(
he
reply
)
<EOS>
n
-
<EOS>
n
-
<EOS>
no
,
what
should
I
be
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
I
thank
God
I
have
a
clear
conscience
;
 
but
I
believe
it
will
be
a
bloody
battle
,
and
I
wish
you
may
not
have
occasion
for
another
hand
to
assist
you
in
the
cockpit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
perceive
his
drift
,
and
make
the
captain
acquaint
with
his
situation
,
desire
he
may
be
station
below
with
me
and
my
mate
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
incense
at
his
pusilanimity
,
bid
me
send
him
down
instantly
,
that
his
fear
may
not
infect
the
ship
's
company
;
whereupon
I
tell
the
poor
steward
,
that
I
have
begg'd
him
for
an
assistant
,
and
desire
him
to
go
down
and
help
my
mate
to
get
ready
the
instrument
and
dressing
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
satisfaction
he
must
have
feel
at
these
tiding
,
he
affect
a
shyness
of
quit
the
upper
deck
;
and
say
,
he
hope
I
do
not
imagine
he
be
afraid
to
do
his
duty
above
board
,
for
he
believe
himself
as
well
prepared
for
death
as
any
man
in
the
ship
,
no
disparagement
to
me
or
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
disgust
at
this
affectation
,
and
in
order
to
punish
his
hypocrisy
,
assure
him
,
he
may
either
go
down
to
the
cockpit
,
or
stay
upon
deck
during
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
alarm
at
this
indifference
,
he
reply
,
"
well
,
to
oblige
you
,
I
will
go
down
,
but
remember
it
be
more
for
your
sake
than
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
disappear
in
a
twinkling
,
without
wait
for
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
we
could
observe
two
tire
of
gun
in
the
ship
which
pursue
us
,
and
which
be
now
but
two
short
mile
astern
.
    
<EOS>
this
discovery
have
an
evident
effect
upon
the
sailor
,
who
do
not
scruple
to
say
,
that
we
should
be
tear
to
piece
,
and
blow
out
of
the
water
,
and
that
if
in
case
any
of
them
should
lose
their
precious
limb
,
they
must
go
a
-
begging
for
life
,
for
there
be
no
provision
make
by
the
merchant
for
those
poor
soul
who
be
maim
in
their
service
.
<EOS>
the
captain
understanding
this
backwardness
,
order
the
crew
abaft
,
and
speak
to
them
thus
;
"
My
lad
,
I
be
tell
you
hang
an
a####se
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
go
to
sea
thirty
year
,
man
and
boy
,
and
never
see
english
sailor
afraid
before
.
 
<EOS>
mayhap
<EOS>
you
think
I
want
to
expose
you
for
the
lucre
of
gain
.
 
<EOS>
Whosoever
think
so
,
think
a
damned
lie
,
for
my
whole
cargo
be
insure
;
so
that
in
case
I
should
be
take
,
my
loss
will
not
be
great
.
 
<EOS>
the
enemy
be
strong
than
we
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
have
we
not
a
chance
for
carry
away
one
of
her
mast
,
and
so
get
clear
of
her
?
 
<EOS>
if
we
find
her
too
hard
for
us
,
'
tis
but
strike
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
man
be
hurt
in
the
engagement
,
I
promise
on
the
word
of
an
honest
seaman
,
to
make
them
a
recompence
accord
to
his
loss
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
,
you
that
be
lazy
,
lubberly
,
cowardly
dog
,
get
away
,
and
sculk
in
the
hold
,
and
bread
-
room
;
and
you
that
be
jolly
boy
,
stand
by
me
,
and
let
us
give
one
broad
-
side
for
the
honour
of
old
England
.
<EOS>
"
this
eloquent
harangue
be
so
well
adapt
to
the
disposition
of
his
hearer
,
that
one
and
all
of
them
,
pull
off
their
hat
,
wave
them
over
their
head
,
and
salute
him
with
three
chear
;
upon
which
he
send
his
boy
for
two
large
case
-
bottle
of
brandy
,
and
have
treat
every
man
with
a
dram
,
they
repair
to
their
quarter
,
and
wait
impatiently
for
the
word
of
command
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
do
my
uncle
the
justice
to
say
,
that
in
the
whole
of
his
disposition
,
he
behave
with
the
utmost
intrepidity
,
conduct
and
deliberation
.
     
<EOS>
the
enemy
be
very
near
,
he
order
me
to
my
station
,
and
be
just
go
to
give
the
word
for
hoist
the
colour
,
and
firing
,
when
the
suppose
Frenchman
,
haul
down
his
white
pennant
jack
and
ensign
,
hoist
english
one
,
and
fire
a
gun
a
-
head
of
us
<EOS>
:
this
be
a
joyful
event
to
captain
Bowling
,
who
immediately
shew
his
colour
,
and
fire
a
gun
to
leeward
:
upon
which
the
other
ship
run
along
-
side
of
him
,
hail
him
,
and
give
him
to
know
that
she
be
an
english
man
of
war
of
forty
gun
,
order
him
to
hoist
out
his
boat
and
come
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
perform
with
the
more
alacrity
,
because
upon
enquiry
,
he
find
that
she
be
command
by
an
old
mess
-
mate
of
his
,
who
be
overjoy
to
see
him
,
detain
him
to
dinner
,
and
send
his
barge
for
the
supercargo
and
me
,
who
be
very
much
caress
on
his
account
.
 
<EOS>
as
this
commander
be
destine
to
cruise
upon
the
French
,
in
the
latitude
of
Martinico
,
his
stem
and
quarter
be
adorn
with
white
flower
de
lis
,
and
the
whole
shell
of
the
ship
so
much
disguise
,
for
a
decoy
to
the
enemy
,
that
it
be
no
wonder
<EOS>
my
uncle
do
not
know
her
,
although
he
have
sail
on
board
of
her
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
We
keep
company
with
her
four
day
,
during
which
time
the
captain
be
never
asund
,
and
then
part
,
our
course
lie
different
from
her

<EOS>
in

than
a
fortnight
after
,

Our

our
departure
from
Cape
Negro
,
and
arrive
in
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
in
six
week

have
meet
with
nothing
remarkable
in

except
an
epidemic
fever
,
not
unlike
the
jail
distemper

which
break
out
among

chapter
LXVI
<EOS>
I
be
invite
to
the
Villa
of
a
Spanish
Don
,
where
we
meet
with
an
english
gentleman
,
and
make
a
very
interesting
discovery
 
we
leave
Buenos
Ayres
,
and
arrive
at
Jamaica
.
  
<EOS>
Our
ship
be
free
from
the
disagreeable
lading
of
Negroes
,
to
whom
indeed
I
have
be
a
miserable
slave
,
since
our
leave
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
I
begin
to
enjoy
myself
,
and
breathe
with
pleasure
the
pure
air
of
Paraguay
,
this
part
of
which
be
reckon
the
Montpelier
of
South
America
,
and
have
obtain
,
on
account
of
its
climate
,
the
name
of
Buenos
Ayres
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
delicious
place
,
that
I
give
myself
entirely
up
to
the
thought
of
my
dear
Narcissa
,
whose
image
still
keep
full
possession
of
my
breast
,
and
whose
charm
,
enhance
by
absence
,
appear
to
my
imagination
,
if
possible
,
more
engaging
than
ever
!
<EOS>
I
calculate
the
profit
of
my
voyage
,
which
even
exceed
my
expectation
;
resolve
to
purchase
a
handsome
fine
-
cure
upon
my
arrival
in
England
,
and
if
I
should
find
the
Squire
as
averse
to
me
as
ever
,
marry
his
sister
by
stealth
;
and
in
case
our
family
should
encrease
,
rely
upon
the
generosity
of
my
uncle
,
who
be
by
this
time
worth
a
considerable
sum
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
amuse
myself
with
these
agreeable
project
,
and
the
transport
hope
of
enjoy
Narcissa
,
we
be
very
much
caress
by
the
spanish
gentleman
,
who
frequently
form
party
of
pleasure
for
our
entertainment
,
in
which
we
make
excursion
a
good
way
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
among
those
who
signalize
themselves
by
their
civility
to
us
,
there
be
one
Don
Antonio
de
Ribera
,
a
very
polite
young
gentleman
,
with
whom
I
have
contract
an
intimate
friendship
,
who
invite
us
one
day
to
his
country
-
house
,
and
as
a
further
inducement
to
our
compliance
,
promise
to
procure
for
us
the
company
of
an
english
signor
,
who
have
be
settle
in
these
part
many
year
,
and
acquire
the
love
and
esteem
of
the
whole
province
by
his
affability
,
good
sense
,
and
honourable
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
We
accept
his
invitation
,
and
set
out
for
his
Villa
,
where
we
have
not
be
long
than
an
hour
,
when
the
person
arrive
,
in
whose
favour
I
have
be
so
much
prepossess
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
man
,
remarkably
well
shaped
,
of
a
fine
mein
and
appearance
commanding
respect
,
and
seem
to
be
turn
of
forty
;
the
feature
of
his
face
be
sadden
with
a
reserve
and
gravity
,
which
in
other
country
would
have
be
think
the
effect
of
melancholy
;
but
here
,
appear
to
have
be
contract
by
his
commerce
with
the
Spaniards
,
who
be
remarkable
for
that
severity
of
countenance
:
understanding
from
Don
Antonio
,
that
we
be
his
countryman
,
he
salute
us
all
round
very
complaisantly
,
and
fix
his
eye
attentively
on
me
,
utter
a
deep
sigh
.
     
<EOS>
I
have
be
strike
with
a
profound
veneration
for
him
at
his
first
come
into
the
room
;
and
no
sooner
observe
this
expression
of
his
sorrow
,
direct
,
as
it
be
,
in
a
particular
manner
to
me
,
than
my
heart
take
part
in
his
grief
,
I
sympathize
involuntarily
,
and
sigh
in
my
turn
.
 
<EOS>
have
ask
leave
of
our
entertainer
,
he
accost
us
in
English
,
profess
his
satisfaction
at
see
so
many
of
his
countryman
in
such
a
remote
place
,
and
ask
the
captain
,
who
go
by
the
name
of
Signor
Thoma
,
from
what
part
of
Britain
he
sail
,
and
whither
he
be
bind
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
tell
him
that
we
have
sail
from
the
river
Thames
,
and
be
bind
for
the
same
place
,
by
the
way
of
Jamaica
,
where
we
intend
to
take
in
a
lading
of
sugar
.
    
<EOS>
have
satisfied
himself
in
these
and
other
particular
about
the
state
of
the
war
,
he
give
us
to
understand
,
that
he
have
a
longing
desire
to
revisit
his
native
country
,
in
consequence
of
which
<EOS>
,
he
have
already
transmit
to
Europe
the
great
part
of
his
fortune
in
neutral
bottom
,
and
would
willingly
embark
the
rest
of
it
,
with
himself
,
in
our
ship
,
provide
the
captain
have
no
objection
to
such
a
passenger
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
very
prudently
reply
,
that
for
his
part
,
he
should
be
glad
of
his
company
,
if
he
could
procure
the
consent
of
the
governor
,
without
which
he
durst
not
admit
him
on
board
,
whatever
inclination
he
have
to
oblige
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
approve
of
his
discretion
,
and
tell
him
,
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
obtain
the
connivance
of
the
governor
,
who
be
his
good
friend
,
shift
the
conversation
to
another
subject
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
overjoyed
to
hear
his
intention
,
and
already
interested
myself
so
much
in
his
favour
,
that
have
he
be
disappoint
,
I
should
have
be
very
unhappy
:
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
entertainment
,
he
eye
me
with
uncommon
attachment
;
I
feel
a
surprizing
attraction
towards
him
;
when
he
speak
,
I
listen
with
attention
and
reverence
;
the
dignity
of
his
deportment
fill
me
with
affection
and
awe
;
and
in
short
,
the
emotion
of
my
soul
,
in
presence
of
this
stranger
,
be
strong
and
unaccountable
.
    
<EOS>
have
spend
the
good
part
of
the
day
with
us
,
he
take
his
leave
,
tell
captain
Thoma
,
that
he
would
hear
from
him
in
a
short
time
:
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
go
,
than
I
ask
a
thousand
question
about
him
,
of
Don
Antonio
,
who
could
give
me
no
other
satisfaction
,
than
that
his
name
be
Don
Rodriguez
,
that
he
have
live
fifteen
or
sixteen
year
in
these
part
,
be
repute
rich
,
and
suppose
to
have
be
unfortunate
in
his
young
year
,
because
he
be
observe
to
nourish
a
pensive
melancholy
,
even
from
the
time
of
his
first
settlement
among
them
but
that
no
body
have
venture
to
enquire
into
the
cause
of
his
sorrow
,
in
consideration
of
his
peace
,
which
may
suffer
in
the
recapitulation
of
his
misfortune
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
seize
with
an
irresistible
desire
of
know
the
particular
of
his
fate
,
and
enjoy
not
one
hour
of
repose
during
the
whole
night
,
by
reason
of
the
eager
conception
that
inspire
me
,
with
regard
to
history
,
which
I
resolve
(
if
possible
)
to
learn
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
,
while
we
be
at
breakfast
,
three
mule
richly
caparison
arrive
,
with
a
message
from
Don
Rodriguez
,
desire
our
company
,
and
that
of
Don
Antonio
,
at
his
house
,
which
be
situate
about
ten
mile
further
up
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
with
this
invitation
,
in
consequence
of
which
we
mount
the
mule
which
he
have
provide
for
us
,
and
alight
at
his
house
before
noon
.
     
<EOS>
here
we
be
splendidly
entertain
by
the
generous
stranger
,
who
still
seem
to
shew
a
particular
regard
for
me
,
and
after
dinner
,
make
me
a
present
of
a
ring
set
with
a
beautiful
amethyst
,
the
production
of
that
country
,
say
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
be
once
bless
with
a
son
,
who
,
have
he
live
,
would
have
be
nearly
of
my
age
.
<EOS>
this
observation
,
deliver
with
a
profound
sigh
,
make
my
heart
throb
with
violence
;
a
crowd
of
confused
idea
rush
upon
my
imagination
,
which
,
while
I
endeavour
to
unravel
,
my
uncle
perceive
my
absence
of
thought
,
and
tap
me
on
the
shoulder
,
say
,
"
oon
!
<EOS>
be
you
asleep
,
Rory
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
before
I
have
time
to
reply
,
Don
Rodriguez
,
with
an
uncommon
eagerness
of
voice
and
look
,
pronounce

become
quite
delirious

so
that
the
preparation
be
countermand

the
joy
of

convert
into
grief

despair

<EOS>
Physicians
be
instantly

I
be
plentifully

<EOS>
I
no
sooner
find
myself
deliver
from
the
disease

than
I
bethink
myself
of
my
honest
friend
Strap

and
resolve
to
make
him
happy
forthwith
,
in
the
knowledge
of
my
good
fortune
,
tell
my
father
,
in
general
,
that
I
have
be
infinitely
oblige
to
this
faithful
adherent

and
beg
he
would
indulge
me
so
far
as
to
send
for
him
,
without
let
him
know
my
happiness
,
until
he
could
receive
an
account
of
it

own
mouth

<EOS>
My
request

carry
order
from

<EOS>
My
health
be
,
in
the
mean
time
,
re
-
establish
,
and
my
mind
compose
<EOS>
,
I
begin
to
relish
this
important
turn
of
my
fortune
,
in
reflect
upon
the
advantage
with
which
it
must
be
attend
;
and
as
the
idea
of
my
lovely
Narcissa
always
join
itself
to
every
scene
of
happiness
I
could
imagine
,
I
entertain
myself
now
,
with
the
prospect
of
possess
her
in
that
distinguished
sphere
,
to
which
she
be
intitle
by
her
birth
and
qualification
.
     
<EOS>
have
often
mention
her
name
while
I
be
deprive
of
my
sense
,
my
father
guess
that
there
be
an
intimate
connexion
between
us
,
and
discover
the
picture
which
hang
in
my
bosom
by
a
ribbon
<EOS>
,
do
not
doubt
that
it
be
the
resemblance
of
my
amiable
mistress
:
in
this
belief
he
be
confirm
by
my
uncle
,
who
tell
him
that
it
be
the
picture
of
a
young
woman
,
to
whom
I
be
under
promise
of
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
alarm
at
this
piece
of
information
,
Don
Rodriguez
take
the
first
opportunity
of
question
me
about
the
circumstance
of
this
affair
,
which
when
I
have
candidly
recount
,
he
approve
of
my
passion
,
and
promise
to
contribute
all
in
his
power
towards
its
success
:
though
I
never
doubt
his
generosity
,
I
be
transport
on
this
occasion
,
and
throw
myself
at
his
foot
,
tell
him
,
he
have
now
compleate
my
happiness
;
for
without
the
possession
of
Narcissa
,
I
should
be
miserable
among
all
the
pleasure
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
raise
me
with
a
smile
of
paternal
fondness
;
say
,
he
know
what
it
be
to
be
in
love
;
and
observe
,
<EOS>
that
if
he
have
be
as
tenderly
beloved
by
his
father
,
as
I
be
by
mine
,
he
would
not
now
,
perhaps
,
have
cause
 
<EOS>
here
he
be
interrupt
by
a
sigh
,
the
tear
stand
collect
in
his
eye
<EOS>
,
he
suppress
the
dictate
of
his
grief
,
and
the
time
be
opportune
,
desire
me
to
relate
the
passage
of
my
life
,
which
my
uncle
have
tell
him
be
manifold
and
surprizing
.
     
<EOS>
I
recount
the
most
material
circumstance
of
my
fortune
,
to
which
he
listen
with
wonder
and
attention
,
manifest
from
time
to
time
those
different
emotion
,
which
my
different
situation
may
be
suppose
to
have
raise
in
a
parent
's
breast
;
and
when
my
detail
be
end
,
bless
God
for
the
adversity
I
have
undergo
,
which
,
he
say
,
enlarge
the
understanding
,
improve
the
heart
,
steel
the
constitution
,
and
qualify
a
young
man
for
all
the
duty
and
enjoyment
of
life
,
much
well
than
any
education
which
affluence
could
bestow
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
have
thus
satisfy
his
curiosity
,
I
discover
an
inclination
to
hear
the
particular
of
his
story
,
which
he
gratify
,
by
begin
with
his
marriage
,
and
proceed
to
the
day
of
his
disappearing

full
of
unutterable
woe

but
little
suspecting
that
my

's
unkindness
would
have
descend
to
my

and
set
out
alone

at

<EOS>
I
visit
my
old
friend
<EOS>
Thomson
 
<EOS>
we
set
sail
for
Europe
,
meet
with
an
odd
adventure
 
arrive
in
England
 
<EOS>
I
ride
across
the
country
from
Portsmouth
to
Sussex
 
converse
with
Mrs
Sagely
,
who
inform
me
of
Narcissa
's

in
London
 
in
consequence
of
this
intelligence
<EOS>
,
I
proceed
to
Canterbury

my
old
friend
Morgan

at
London
 
<EOS>

Narcissa
 
introduce
my
father
to
her

be
charm
with
her
good
sense
and
beauty
 
<EOS>
we
come
to
a
determination
of
demand
her
brother
's
consent
to
our
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
I
enquire
,
as
soon
as
I
get
ashore
,
about
my
generous
companion
Mr
Thomson
;
and
hear
that
he
live
in
a
flourishing
condition
,
upon
the
estate
leave
to
him
by
his
wife
's
father
,
who
have
be
dead
some
year
,
I
take
horse
immediately
,
with
the
consent
of
Don
Rodriguez
,
who
have
hear
me
mention
him
with
great
regard
,
and
in
a
few
hour
reach
the
place
of
his
habitation
.
    
<EOS>
I
should
much
wrong
the
delicacy
of
Mr
Thomson
's
sentiment
,
to
say
barely
he
be
glad
to
see
me
:
<EOS>
He
feel
all
that
the
most
sensible
and
disintereste
friendship
could
feel
on
this
occasion
,
introduce
me
to
his
wife
,
a
very
amiable
young
lady
,
who
have
already
bless
him
with
two
fine
child
;
and
be
as
yet
ignorant
of
my
circumstance
,
frankly
offer
me
the
assistance
of
his
purse
and
interest
.
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
generous
intention
,
and
make
him
acquaint
with
my
situation
,
on
which
he
congratulate
me
with
great
joy
,
and
after
I
have
staid
with
him
a
whole
day
and
night
,
accompany
me
back
to
Kingston
,
to
wait
upon
my
father
,
whom
he
invite
to
his
house
:
Don
Rodriguez
comply
with
his
request
,
and
have
be
handsomely
entertain
during
the
space
of
a
week
,
return
extremely
well
satisfied
with
the
behaviour
of
my
friend
and
his
lady
,
to
whom
at
parting
,
he
present
a
valuable
diamond
ring
,
as
a
token
of
his
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
during
the
course
of
my
conversation
with
Mr
Thomson
,
he
let
me
know
,
that
his
and
my
old
commander
captain
Oakhum
be
dead
some
month
,
and
that
immediately
after
his
death
,
a
discovery
have
be
make
of
some
valuable
effect
that
he
have
feloniously
secrete
out
of
a
prize
,
by
the
assistance
of
Dr
Mackshane
,
who
be
now
actually
in
prison
on
that
account
,
and
be
destitute
of
friend
,
subsist
solely
on
the
charity
of
my
friend
,
whose
bounty
he
have
implore
in
the
most
abject
manner
,
after
have
be
the
barbarous
occasion
of
drive
him
to
that
terrible
extremity
on
board
of
the
Thunder
,
which
we
have
formerly
relate
.
 
<EOS>
whatsoever
this
wretch
may
have
be
guilty
of
<EOS>
,
I
applaud
Mr
Thomson
's
generosity
towards
him
in
his
distress
,
which
work
so
much
upon
me
also
,
that
I
send
him
ten
pistole
,
in
such
a
private
manner
,
that
he
could
never
know
his
benefactor
.
    
<EOS>
while
my
father
and
I
be
caress
among
the
gentleman
on
shore
,
captain
Bowling
have
write
to
his
owner
,
by
the
packet
,
which
sail
a
few
day
after
our
arrival
,
signify
his
prosperous
voyage
hitherto
,
and
desire
them
to
ensure
his
ship
and
cargo
homeward
bind
after
which
he
apply
himself
so
heartily
to
the
loading
his
ship
,
that
with
the
assistance
of
Mr
Thomson
,
she
be
full
in
less
than
six
week
.
<EOS>
this
kind
gentleman
likewise
procure
for
Don
Rodriguez
,
bill
upon
London
for
the
great
part
of
his
gold
and
silver
,
by
which
mean
it
be
secure
against
the
risk
of
the
sea
and
the
enemy
;
and
before
we
sail
,
supply
us
with
such
large
quantity
of
all
kind
of
stock
,
that
not
only
we
,
but
the
whole
ship
company
,
fare
sumptuously
during
the
voyage
.
    
<EOS>
every
thing
be
ready
,
we
take
our
leave
of
our
kind
entertainer
,
and
go
on
board
at
Port
Royal
,
set
sail
for
England
on
the
first
day
of
June
.
 
<EOS>
We
beat
up
to
windward
,
with
fine
easy
weather
;
and
one
night
,
believe
ourselves
near
Cape
Tiberoon
,
lie
to
,
with
an
intention
to
wood
and
water
next
morning
in
the
bay
:
while
we
remain
in
this
situation
,
a
sailor
have
drink
more
new
rum
than
he
could
carry
,
stagger
over
-
board
,
and
notwithstanding
all
the
mean
that
could
be
use
to
preserve
him
,
go
to
the
bottom
and
disappear
.
    
<EOS>
about
two
hour
after
this
melancholy
accident
happen
,
as
I
enjoy
a
cool
air
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
I
hear
a
voice
rise
,
as
it
be
,
out
of
the
sea
,
and
call
,
"
Ho
,
the
ship
,
a
hoy
!
"
<EOS>
upon
which
one
of
the
man
upon
the
forecastle
cry
,
"
I
will
be
d####n'd
,
if
that
an't
Jack
Marlinspike
,
who
go
over
-
board
!
"
<EOS>
not
a
little
surprized
at
this
event
,
I
jump
into
the
boat
that
lie
along
-
side
,
with
the
second
mate
and
four
man
,
and
row
towards
the
place
,
from
whence
<EOS>
the
voice
(
which
repeat
the
hail
)
seem
to
proceed
,
we
perceive
something
float
upon
the
water
;
when
we
have
row
a
little
farther
,
we
discern
it
to
be
a
man
ride
upon
a
hencoop
,
who
see
us
approach
,
pronounce
with
a
hoarse
voice
,
"
D####n
your
blood
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
answer
when
I
hail
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Our
mate
,
who
be
a
veritable
seaman
,
hear
this
salute
,
say
,
"
by
G####d
,
my
lad
,
this
be
none
of
our
man
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
devil
 
pull
away
for
the
ship
.
<EOS>
"
the
fellow
obey
his
command
,
without
question
,
and
be
already
some
fathom
on
our
return
,
when
I
insist
on
their
taking
up
the
poor
creature
,
and
prevail
upon
them
to
go
back
to
the
wreck
,
which
when
we
come
near
the
second
time
,
and
signify
our
intention
,
we
receive
an
answer
of
,
"
avast
,
avast
 
<EOS>
what
ship
,
brother
?
<EOS>
"
be
satisfied
in
this
particular
,
he
cry
,
"
D####n
<EOS>
the
ship
,
I
be
in
hope
it
have
be
my
own
 
<EOS>
where
be
you
bind
?
"
    
<EOS>
We
gratify
his
curiosity
in
this
too
;
upon
which
he
suffer
himself
to
be
take
on
board
,
and
after
be
comfort
with
a
dram
,
tell
us
,
he
belong
to
the
Vesuvio
man
of
war
,
upon
a
cruize
off
the
island
of
Hispaniola
;
that
he
have
fall
over
-
board
about
four
and
twenty
hour
ago
,
and
the
ship
be
under
sail
,
they
do
not
chuse
to
bring
to
,
but
toss
a
hen
-
coop
over
-
board
for
his
convenience
,
upon
which
he
be
in
good
hope
of
reach
the
Cape
next
morning
;
<EOS>
howsomever
,
he
be
as
well
content
to
be
aboard
us
,
because
he
do
not
doubt
that
we
should
meet
his
ship
;
and
if
he
have
go
ashore
in
the
bay
,
he
may
have
be
take
prisoner
by
the
French
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
father
be
very
much
divert
with
the
account
of
this
fellow
's
unconcerned
behaviour
;
and
in
two

,
meet
with
the
Vesuvio
,
as
he
expect
,
he
be
send
him
on
board
of
her
accord
to
his
desire
.
    
<EOS>
have
beat
up
successfully
the
windward
passage
,
we
stretch
to
the
northward
,
and
fall
in
with
a
westerly
wind
,
in
eight
week
arrive
in
sounding
,
and
in
two
day
after
make
the
Lizzard
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
joy
I
feel
at
sight
of
english
ground
!
<EOS>
Don
Rodriguez
be
not
unmoved
,
and
Strap
shed
tear
of
gladness
.
 
<EOS>
the
sailor
profit
by
our
satisfaction
;
the
shoe
that
be
nail
to
the
mast
,
be
quite
fill
with
our
liberality
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
resolve
to
run
up
into
the
down
at
once
,
but
the
wind
shift
when
we
be
a
-
breast
of
the
isle
of
Wight
,
he
be
oblige
to
turn
in
to
St
Helens
,
and
come
to
an
anchor
at
Spithead
,
to
the
great
mortification
of
the
crew
,
thirty
of
whom
be
immediately
press
on
board
of
a
man
of
war
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
and
I
go
a
shore
immediately
to
Portsmouth
,
leave
Strap
with
the
captain
to
go
round
with
the
ship
and
take
care
of
our
effect
;
and
I
discover
so
much
impatience
to
see
my
charming
Narcissa
,
that
my
father
permit
me
to
ride
across
the
country
to
her
brother
's
house
;
while
he
should
hire
a
post
-
chaise
for
London
,
where
he
would
wait
for
me
at
a
place
to
which
I
direct
him
.
    
<EOS>
fire
with
all
the
eagerness
of
passion
,
I
take
post
that
very
night
,
and
in
the
morning
reach
an
inn
,
about
three
mile
from
the
Squire
's
habitation
;
here
I
remain
till
next
evening
,
allay
the
torture
of
my
impatience
with
the
rapturous
hope
of
see
that
divine
creature
,
after
an
absence
of
eighteen
month
,
which
so
far
from
impair
,
have
raise
my
love
to
the
most
exalted
pitch
!
<EOS>
neither
be
my
reflection
free
from
apprehension
,
that
sometimes
intervene
in
spite
of
all
my
hope
,
and
represent
her
as
have
yield
to
the
importunity
of
her
brother
,
and
bless
the
arm
of
an
unhappy
rival
 
<EOS>
My
thought
be
even
madden
with
the
fear
of
her
death
;
and
when
I
arrive
in
the
dark
at
the
house
of
Mrs
Sagely
,
I
have
not
for
some
time
courage
to
desire
admittance
,
lest
my
soul
should
be
shock
with
dismal
tiding
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
I
knock
,
and
no
sooner
certify
the
good
gentlewoman
of
my
voice
than
she
open
the
door
,
and
receive
me
with
a
most
affectionate
embrace
,
that
bring
tear
into
her
aged
eye
:
<EOS>
"
for
heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
dear
mother
(
cry
I
)
<EOS>
tell
me
,
how
be
Narcissa
?
<EOS>
be
she
the
same
that
I
leave
her
?
"
<EOS>
She
bless
my
ear
with
say
,
"
She
be
as
beautiful
,
in
as
good
health
,
and
as
much
your
as
ever
.
"
     
<EOS>
Transported
at
this
assurance
,
I
beg
to
know
if
I
could
not
see
her
that
very
night
when
this
sage
matron
give
me
to
understand
that
my
mistress
be
in
London
,
and
that
thing
be
strangely
alter
in
the
Squire
's
house
since
my
departure
;
that
he
have
be
marry
a
whole
year
to
Melinda
,
who
at
first
find
mean
to
wean
his
attention
so
much
from
Narcissa
,
that
he
become
quite
careless
of
that
lovely
sister
,
comfort
himself
with
the
clause
in
his
father
's
will
,
by
which
she
would
forfeit
her
fortune
,
if
she
should
marry
without
his
consent
;
 
that
my
mistress
be
but
indifferently
treat
by
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
have
make
use
of
her
freedom
some
month
ago
,
and
go
to
town
,
where
she
be
lodge
with
Miss
Williams
,
in
expectation
of
my
arrival
;
and
have
be
pester
with
the
address
of
Lord
Quiverwit
,
who
find
her
heart
engage
,
have
fall
upon
a
great
many
shift
,
to
perswade
her
that
I
be
dead
:
but
find
all
his
artifice
unsuccessful
,
and
despairing
of
gain
her
affection
,
he
have
console
himself
for
her
indifference
,
by
marry
another
lady
some
week
ago
,
who
have
already
leave
him
on
account
of
some
family
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
besides
this
interesting
information
,
she
tell
me
,
that
there
be
not
a
great
deal
of
harmony
between
Melinda
and
the
Squire
,
who
be
so
much
disgust
at
the
number
of
gallant
who
continue
to
hover
about
her
even
after
marriage
,
that
he
hurry
her
down
into
the
country
much
against
her
inclination
,
where
their
mutual
animosity
have
rise
to
such
a
height
,
that
they
preserve
no
decency
before
company
or
servant
,
but
abuse
one
another
in
the
gross
term
.
    
<EOS>
this
good
old
gentlewoman
,
to
give
me
a
convincing
proof
of
my
dear
Narcissa
's
unalterable
love
,
gratify
me
with
a
sight
of
the
last
letter
she
have
favour
her
with
,
in
which
I
be
mention
with
so
much
honour
,
tenderness
and
concern
,
that
my
soul
be
fire
with
impatience
,
and
I
determine
to
ride
all
night
,
that
I
may
have
it
the
sooner
in
my
power
to
make
her
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sagely
perceive
my
eagerness
,
and
her
maternal
affection
be
equally
divide
between
Narcissa
and
me
,
beg
leave
to
remind
me
of
the
sentiment
with
which
I
go
abroad
,
that
would
not
permit
me
for
any
selfish
gratification
to
prejudice
the
fortune
of
that
amiable
young
lady
,
who
must
entirely
depend
upon
me
,
after
have
bestow
herself
in
marriage

<EOS>
I

her
kind
concern
,
and
as
briefly
as
possible
describe
my
flourish
situation
,
which
afford
this
humane
person
infinite
wonder
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
that
now
I
have
an
opportunity
to
manifest
my
gratitude
for
the
obligation
I
owe
,
I
would
endeavour
to
make
her
old
age
comfortable
and
easy
;
as
a
step
to
which
,
I
propose
she
should
come
and
live
with
Narcissa
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
venerable
gentlewoman
be
so
much
affected
with
my
word
,
that

down
her
ancient
cheek
;
she
thank
heaven
that
I
have
not

the
presage
she
have
make
,
on
her
first
acquaintance
with
me
;
acknowledge
my
generosity
,
as
she
call
it
,
in
the
most
elegant
and
pathetick
expression
;
but
decline
my
proposal
,
on
account
of
her
attachment
to
the
dear
melancholy
cottage
where
she
have
so
peacefully
consume
her
solitary
widowhood
.
    
<EOS>

this
subject

I
insist
on

a
present
of
thirty
guinea
,
and
take
my
leave

resolve
to

the
more
comfortable

of
the
infirmity
of

<EOS>
Alarm'd

at
this
intelligence
,
I
go
to
his

and
find
my

<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
convinced
of
my
identity
,
than
he
throw
down
the
pestle
,
overset
the
mortar
,
and

<EOS>
He
be
very
desirous
of

<EOS>
He
insist
however
on
my
staying

and
introduce

to
his

,
who
seem
to
be

<EOS>
when
I
inform

of
Mackshane

,
he
seem'd
at

to
exult
over
his

;
but
after
a

recollection
,

say
,
"

great
concern
for
the
soul
of
captain
Oakhum
,
which
he
believe
be
now
gnash
its
tooth
:
but

<EOS>

and

that

,
where
I

;
promise
to

over
to

in
a
few
day
a
sufficiency
to

,
and
express
a
desire
of
see
this
amiable
creature
,
who
have
captivate
me
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
not
sleep
the
night
before
,
and
be
besides
fatigue
with
my
journey
,
I
find
myself
under
a
necessity
of
take
some
repose
,
and
go
to

accordingly
:
<EOS>
next
morning
<EOS>
about

and
clasp

by
an

"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
it
be
from
an
apprehension
that
my
sudden
appearance
would
have
some
bad
effect
on
my
dear
Narcissa
,
that
I
have
desire
to
see

<EOS>
in

some

in

I
be

<EOS>
when
I
go
home
,
this
generous
parent
enquire
very
affectionately
about
the
health
of
my
dear
Narcissa
,
to
whom
that
I
may
be
the
more
agreeable
,
he
put
into
my
hand
a
deed
,
by
which
I
find
myself
in
possession
of
fifteen
thousand
pound
,
exclusive
of
the
profit
of
my
own
merchandize
,
which
amount
to
three
thousand

the
occasion
,
make
a
most
dazzling
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
could
perceive
him
strike
with
her
figure
,
which
I
really
think
be
the
most
beautiful
that
ever
be
create
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
He
embrace
her
tenderly
,
and
tell
her
,
he
be
proud
of

She

and
with
eye
full

the
soft
languishment
turn
upon
me
,
<EOS>
say
,
she
would
have
be
unworthy

have
she
be
blind
to
his
extraordinary
merit
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
other
answer
than
a
low
bow
.
<EOS>
My

sighing
,
pronounce
,
"

<EOS>
while
the

rush
into

and
the
tender
heart
of
Narcissa
manifest
itself
in
two
precious
drop
of
sympathy
,
which
,
but
for
his
presence
,
I
would
have
kiss
away
.
<EOS>
without
repeat
the
particular
of
our
conversation
,
I
shall
only
observe
,
that
Don
Rodriguez
be
as
much
charm
with
her
good
-
sense
,
as
with
her
appearance
;
and
she
be
no
less
pleased
with
his
understanding
and
polite
address
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
determine
that
he
should
write
to
the
Squire
signify
his
approbation
of
my
passion
for
his
sister
,
and
offer
a
settlement
which
he
should
have
no
reason
to
reject
;
and
that
,
if
he
should
refuse
the
proposal
,
we
would
crown
our
mutual
wish
without
any
farther
regard
to
his
will

the

to
the
satisfaction
of
all

,
my

address
himself
thus
to
Narcissa
,
"
Madam

"
with
these
word
,
he
put
into
her
hand
a
bank
-
note
for
500l
which
she
no
sooner
examine
,
than
with
a
low
curtesy
she
reply
,
"
<EOS>
Dear
Sir

tho

<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
occasion
for
this
supply
,
I
have
too
great
a
veneration
for
you
,
to
refuse
this
proof
of
your
generosity
and
esteem
,
which
I
the
more
freely
receive
,
because
I
already
look
upon
Mr
Random
's
interest
as
inseparably
connect
with
mine
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
well
pleased
at
her
frank
and
ingenuous
reply
,
upon
which
we
salute
,
and
wish
her
good
night
.
     
<EOS>
the
letter
,
at
my
request
,
be
dispatch
to
Sussex
by
an
express
,
and
in
the
mean
time
,
Don
Rodriguez
,
to
grace
my
nuptial
,
hire
a
ready
-
furnished
house
,
and
set
up
a
very
handsom
equipage
.
    
<EOS>
though
I
pass
the
great
part
of
the
day
with
the
darling
of
my
soul
,
I
find
leisure
sometimes
to
be
among
my
former
acquaintance
,
who
be
astonish
at
the
magnificence
of
my
appearance
:
banter
in
particular
be
confound
at
the
strange
vicissitude
of
my
fortune
,
the
cause
of
which
he
endeavour
in
vain
to
discover
,
until
I
think
fit
to
disclose
the
whole
secret
of
my
last
voyage
,
partly
in
consideration
of
our
former
intimacy
,
and
partly
to
prevent
unfavourable
conjecture
which
he
and
other
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
make
in
regard
to
my
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
profess
great
satisfaction
at
this
piece
of
news
,
and
I
have
no
cause
to
believe
him
insincere
,
when
I
consider
that
he
would
now
look
upon
himself
as
acquit
of
the
debt
he
owe
me
,
and
at
the
same
time
flat
himself
with
hope
of
borrow
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
carry
him
home
to
dinner
with
me
,
and
my
father
like
his
conversation
so
much
,
that
upon
hear
his
difficulty
,
he
desire
me
to
accommodate
him
for
the
present
,
and
enquire
if
he
would
accept
of
a
commission
in
the
army
,
towards
the
purchase
of
which
he
would
willingly
lend
him
money
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
give
my
friend
an
opportunity
of
be
alone
with
me
,
when
,
as
I
expect
,
he
tell
me
that
he
be
just
on
the

unaffected
modesty

as
a
testimony

I
present
her

in

with
a
deed

I

take

assure

its

we

visit

receive

the
little
time
we
stay
in

be
spend
in

to
publick
diversion

where
I
have
the
vanity
to

one
night
in

we
have
send

seem'd

be
pleased
at

the
more
,
because

different

,
look
at
us
with
disdain
,
then
whisper
to
her
husband
,
and
break
out
into
an
affected
giggle
;
but
all
her
art
prove
ineffectual
,
either
to
discompose
Mrs
Random
,
or
to
conceal
her
own
mortification
,
which
at
length
force
her
away
long
before
the
play
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
news
of
our

be
spread

with
many
circumstance
to

our

as
much

Narcissa

on
horse
-
back
:
as
we
make
easy
stage
,
my
charmer
hold
it
out
very
well
,
till
we
arrive
at
Edinburgh
,
where
we
propose
to
rest
ourselves
some
week
.
<EOS>
People
of
our
figure
could
not
fail
of
attract
the
notice
of
such
a
small
place
,
where
,
as
soon
as
our
family
be
know
,
we
be
load
with
caress
,
and
Narcissa
be
so
much
pleased
with
the
civility
she
receive
,
that
she
protest
she
would
never
desire
to
live
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
here
Don
Rodriguez
have
intelligence
that
his
nephew
the
fox
-
hunter
have
spend
his
estate
,
which
be
to
be
expose
to
sale
by
publick
auction
,
he
determine
to
make
a
purchase
of
the
spot
where
he
be
bear
,
and
actually
buy
the
whole
of
his
father
's
land
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
few
day
after
this
bargain
be
make
,
we
leave
Edinburgh
,
in
order
to
go
and
take
possession
;
and
by
the
way
,
halt
one
night
in
that
town
where
I
be
educate
.
 
<EOS>
upon
inquiry
,
I
find
that
Mr
Crab
be
dead
;
whereupon
I
send
for
his
executor
,
pay
the
sum
I
owe
,
with
interest
,
and
take
up
my
bond
.
<EOS>
Mr
Potion
and
his
wife
hearing
of
our
arrival
,
have
the
assurance
to
come
to
the
inn
where
we
lodge
,
and
send
up
their
name
,
with
a
desire
of
be
permit
to
pay
their
respect
to
my
father
and
me
:
    
but
their
sordid
behaviour
towards
me
,
when
I
be
an
orphan
,
have
make
too
deep
an
impression
on
my
mind
,
to
be
efface
by
this
mean
mercenary
piece
of
condescension
;
I
therefore
reject
their
message
with
disdain
,
and
bid
Strap
tell
them
,
that
my
father
and
I
desire
to
have
no
communication
with
such
low
-
minded
wretch
as
they
be
.
    
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
go
half
an
hour
,
when
a
woman
without
any
ceremony
,
open
the
door
of
the
room
where
we
sit
,
and
make
towards
my
father
,
accost
him
with
,
"
Uncle
,
your
servant
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
see
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
one
of
my
female
cousin
,
mention
in
the
first
part
of
my
memoir
,
to
whom
Don
Rodriguez
reply
,
"
pray
,
who
be
you
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
(
cry
she
)
<EOS>
my
cousin
Rory
there
,
know
me
very
well
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
me
,
Rory
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
,
(
say
I
)
for
my
own
part
,
I
shall
never
forget
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
this
be
one
of
the
young
lady
,
who
(
as
I
have
formerly
tell
you
)
treat
me
so
humanely
in
my
childhood
!
"
<EOS>
when
I
pronounce
these
word
,
my
father
's
resentment
glow
in
his
visage
,
and
he
order
her
to
be
go
,
with
such
a
command
aspect
,
that
she
retire
in
a
fright
,
mutter
curse
as
she
go
down
stair
:
We
afterwards
learn
that
she
be
married
to
an
ensign
,
who
have
already
spend
all
her
fortune
;
and
that
her
sister
have
bear
a
child
to
her
mother
's
footman
,
who
be
now
her
husband
,
and
keep
a
petty
ale
-
house
in
the
country
.
    
<EOS>
the
fame
of
our
flourish
condition
have
arrive
at
this
place
before
us
<EOS>
,
we
get
notice
that
the
magistrate
intend
next
day
to
compliment
us
with
the
freedom
of
their
town
;
upon
which
my
father
,
consider
their
complaisance
in
the
right
point
of
view
,
order
the
horse
to
the
coach
early
in
the
morning
,
when
we
proceed
to
our
estate
,
which
lie
about
a
dozen
mile
from
this
place
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
come
within
half
a
league
of
the
house
,
we
be
meet
by
a
prodigious
number
of
poor
tenant
,
man
,
woman
and
child
,
who
testify
their
joy
by
loud
acclamation
,
and
accompany
our
coach
to
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
part
of
the
world
,
in
which
the
peasant
be
more
attached
to
their
Lords
,
than
in
Scotland
,
we
be
almost
devour
by
their
affection
,
in
get
out
of
the
coach
:
My
father
have
always
be
their
favourite
,
and
now
that
he
appear
their
master
,
after
be
think
dead
so
long
,
their
joy
break
out
into
a
thousand
extravagancy
<EOS>
:
when
we
get
into
the
court
-
yard
,
we
be
surround
by
a
vast
number
,
who
crowd
together
so
closely
to
see
us
,
that
several
be
in
danger
of
be
squeeze
to
death
;
those
who
be
near
Don
Rodriguez
sell
upon
their
knee
,
and
kiss
his
hand
,
or
the
hem
of
his
garment
,
pray
aloud
for
long
life
and
prosperity
to
him
;
other
approach
Narcissa
and
me
in
the
same
manner
;
while
the
rest
clap
their
hand
at
a
distance
,
and
invoke
heaven
to
shower
its
choice
blessing
on
our
head
!
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
whole
scene
,
though
rude
,
be
so
affect
,
that
the
gentle
partner
of
my
heart
weep
over
it
,
and
my
father
himself
could
not
refrain
from
drop
a
tear
.
   
<EOS>
have
welcome
his
daughter
and
me
to
his
house
,
he
order
some
bullock
to
be
kill
,
and
some
hogshead
of
ale
to
be
bring
from
the
neighbouring
village
,
to
regale
those
honest
people
,
who
have
not
enjoy
such
a
holiday
for
many
year
before
.
    
<EOS>
next
day
we
be
visit
by
the
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
most
of
them
our
relation
,
one
of
whom
bring
along
with
him
my
cousin
,
the
fox
-
hunter
,
who
have
staid
at
his
house
,
since
he
be
oblige
to
leave
his
own
:
My
father
be
generous
enough
to
receive
him
kindly
,
and
even
promise
to
purchase
for
him
a
commission
in
the
army
,
at
which
he
express
great
thankfulness
and
joy
.
    
<EOS>
My
charming
Narcissa
be
universally
admire
and
love
for
her
beauty
,
affability
and
good
sense
;
and
so
well
pleased
with
the
situation
of
the
place
,
and
the
company
around
,
that
she
have
not
,
as
yet
,
discover
the
least
desire
of
change
her
habitation
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
not
be
many
day
settle
,
when
I
prevail
upon
my
father
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
village
where
I
have
be
at
school
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
receive
by
the
principal
inhabitant
,
who
entertain
us
in
the
church
,
where
Mr
Syntax
the
schoolmaster
(
my
tyrant
be
dead
)
pronounce
a
latin
speech
in
honour
of
our
family
:
<EOS>
and
none
exert
themselves
more
than
Strap
's
father
and
relation
,
who
look
upon
the
honest
valet
as
the
first
gentleman
of
their
race
,
and
honour
his
benefactor
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
have
receive
the
homage
of
this
place
,
we
retire
,
leave
forty
pound
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
of
the
parish
;
and
that
very
night
,
Strap
be
a
little
elevated
with
the
regard
that
have
be
shew
to
him
,
and
to
me
on
his
account
,
venture
to
tell
me
,
that
he
have
a
sneak
kindness
for
Miss
Williams
,
and
that
if
his
lady
and
I
would
use
our
interest
in
his
behalf
,
he
do
not
doubt
that
she
would
listen
to
his
address
.
<EOS>
surprize
at
this
proposal
,
I
ask
if
he
know
the
story
of
that
unfortunate
young
gentlewoman
:
upon
which
,
he
reply
,
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
know
what
you
mean
 
<EOS>
she
have
be
unhappy
<EOS>
,
I
grant
you
 
<EOS>
but
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
I
be
convince
of
her
reformation
;
or
else
you
and
my
good
lady
would
not
treat
her
with
such
respect
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
censure
of
the
world
,
I
value
it
not
a
fig
's
end
 
<EOS>
besides
,
the
world
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
I
commend
his
philosophy
,
and
interest
Narcissa
in
his
cause
;
who
intercede
so
effectually
,
that
in
a
little
time
,
Miss
Williams
,
yield
her
consent
,
and
they
be
marry
with
the
approbation
of
Don
Rodriguez
,
who
give
him
five
hundred
pound
to
stock
a
farm
,
and
make
him
overseer
of
his
estate
.
<EOS>
My
generous
bedfellow
give
her
maid
the
same
sum
;
so
that
they
live
in
great
peace
and
plenty
within
half
a
mile
of
us
,
and
daily
put
up
prayer
for
our
preservation
.
    
<EOS>
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
true
happiness
on
earth
,
I
enjoy
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
impetuous
transport
of
my
passion
be
now
settle
and
mellow
into
endearing
fondness
and
tranquillity
of
love
,
root
by
that
intimate
connexion
and
interchange
of
heart
,
which
nought
but
virtuous
wedlock
can
produce
.
     
<EOS>
Fortune
seem
determined
to
make
ample
amend
for
her
former
cruelty
;
for
my
proctor
write
,
that
notwithstanding
the
clause
in
my
father
-
in
-
law
's
will
,
on
which
the
Squire
found
his
claim
,
I
shall
certainly
recover
my
wife
's
fortune
,
in
consequence
of
a
codicil
annex
,
which
explain
that
clause
,
and
limit
her
restriction
to
the
age
of
nineteen
,
after
which
she
be
at
her
own
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
set
out
for
London
immediately
after
receive
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
but
my
dear
angel
have
be
qualmish
of
late
,
and
begin
to
grow
remarkably
round
in
the
waist
;
so
that
I
can
not
leave
her
in
such
an
interesting
situation
,
which
I
hope
will
produce
something
to
crown
my
felicity
.
