My
true
name
be
so
well
known
in
the
record
or
register
at
Newgate
,
and
in
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
there
be
some
thing
of
such
consequence
still
depend
there
,
relate
to
my
particular
conduct
,
that
it
be
not
be
expect
I
should
set
my
name
or
the
account
of
my
family
to
this
work
;
perhaps
,
after
my
death
,
it
may
be
better
know
;
at
present
it
would
not
be
proper
,
no
not
though
a
general
pardon
should
be
issue
,
even
without
exception
and
reserve
of
person
or
crime
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
tell
you
,
that
as
some
of
my
bad
comrade
,
who
be
out
of
the
way
of
do
me
harm
(
have
go
out
of
the
world
by
the
step
and
the
string
,
as
I
often
expect
to
go
)
,
know
me
by
the
name
of
Moll
Flanders
,
so
you
may
give
me
leave
to
speak
of
myself
under
that
name
till
I
dare
own
who
I
have
be
,
as
well
as
who
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
tell
that
in
one
of
neighbour
nation
,
whether
it
be
in
France
or
where
else
I
know
not
,
they
have
an
order
from
the
king
,
that
when
any
criminal
be
condemn
,
either
to
die
,
or
to
the
galley
,
or
to
be
transport
,
if
they
leave
any
child
,
as
such
be
generally
unprovided
for
,
by
the
poverty
or
forfeiture
of
their
parent
,
so
they
be
immediately
take
into
the
care
of
the
Government
,
and
put
into
a
hospital
call
the
House
of
Orphans
,
where
they
be
breed
up
,
clothe
,
fed
,
teach
,
and
when
fit
to
go
out
,
be
place
out
to
trade
or
to
service
,
so
as
to
be
well
able
to
provide
for
themselves
by
an
honest
,
industrious
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
have
this
be
the
custom
in
our
country
,
I
have
not
be
leave
a
poor
desolate
girl
without
friend
,
without
clothe
,
without
help
or
helper
in
the
world
,
as
be
my
fate
;
and
by
which
I
be
not
only
expose
to
very
great
distress
,
even
before
I
be
capable
either
of
understand
my
case
or
how
to
amend
it
,
but
bring
into
a
course
of
life
which
be
not
only
scandalous
in
itself
,
but
which
in
its
ordinary
course
tend
to
the
swift
destruction
both
of
soul
and
body
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
case
be
otherwise
here
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
be
convict
of
felony
for
a
certain
petty
theft
scarce
worth
naming
,
viz
.
<EOS>
have
an
opportunity
of
borrow
three
piece
of
fine
holland
of
a
certain
draper
in
Cheapside
.
 
<EOS>
the
circumstance
be
too
long
to
repeat
,
and
I
have
hear
them
relate
so
many
way
,
that
I
can
scarce
be
certain
which
be
the
right
account
.
  
<EOS>
however
it
be
,
this
they
all
agree
in
,
that
my
mother
plead
her
belly
,
and
be
find
quick
with
child
,
she
be
respite
for
about
seven
month
;
in
which
time
have
bring
me
into
the
world
,
and
be
about
again
,
she
be
call
down
,
as
they
term
it
,
to
her
former
judgment
,
but
obtain
the
favour
of
be
transport
to
the
plantation
,
and
leave
me
about
half
a
year
old
;
and
in
bad
hand
,
you
may
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
too
near
the
first
hour
of
my
life
for
me
to
relate
anything
of
myself
but
by
hearsay
;
it
be
enough
to
mention
,
that
as
I
be
bear
in
such
an
unhappy
place
,
I
have
no
parish
to
have
recourse
to
for
my
nourishment
in
my
infancy
;
nor
can
I
give
the
least
account
how
I
be
keep
alive
,
other
than
that
,
as
I
have
be
tell
,
some
relation
of
my
mother
's
take
me
away
for
a
while
as
a
nurse
,
but
at
whose
expense
,
or
by
whose
direction
,
I
know
nothing
at
all
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
account
that
I
can
recollect
,
or
could
ever
learn
of
myself
,
be
that
I
have
wander
among
a
crew
of
those
people
they
call
gypsy
,
or
Egyptians
;
but
I
believe
it
be
but
<EOS>
a
very
little
while
that
I
have
be
among
them
,
for
I
have
not
have
my
skin
discolour
or
blacken
,
as
they
do
very
young
to
all
the
child
they
carry
about
with
them
;
nor
can
I
tell
how
I
come
among
them
,
or
how
I
get
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
at
Colchester
,
in
Essex
,
that
those
people
leave
me
;
and
I
have
a
notion
in
my
head
that
I
leave
them
there
(
that
is
,
that
I
hide
myself
and
would
not
go
any
farther
with
them
)
,
but
I
be
not
able
to
be
particular
in
that
account
;
only
this
I
remember
,
that
be
take
up
by
some
of
the
parish
officer
of
Colchester
,
I
give
an
account
that
I
come
into
the
town
with
the
gypsy
,
but
that
I
would
not
go
any
farther
with
them
,
and
that
so
they
have
leave
me
,
but
whither
they
be
go
that
I
know
not
,
nor
could
they
expect
it
of
me
;
for
though
they
send
round
the
country
to
inquire
after
them
<EOS>
,
it
seem
they
could
not
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
a
way
to
be
provide
for
;
for
though
I
be
not
a
parish
charge
upon
this
or
that
part
of
the
town
by
law
,
yet
as
my
case
come
to
be
know
,
and
that
I
be
too
young
to
do
any
work
,
be
not
above
three
year
old
,
compassion
move
the
magistrate
of
the
town
to
order
some
care
to
be
take
of
me
,
and
I
become
one
of
their
own
as
much
as
if
I
have
be
bear
in
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
provision
they
make
for
me
,
it
be
my
good
hap
to
be
put
to
nurse
,
as
they
call
it
,
to
a
woman
who
be
indeed
poor
but
have
be
in
well
circumstance
,
and
who
get
a
little
livelihood
by
take
such
as
I
be
suppose
to
be
,
and
keep
them
with
all
necessary
,
till
they
be
at
a
certain
age
,
in
which
it
may
be
suppose
they
may
go
to
service
or
get
their
own
bread
.
  
<EOS>
this
woman
have
also
have
a
little
school
,
which
she
keep
to
teach
child
to
read
and
to
work
;
and
have
,
as
I
have
say
,
live
before
that
in
good
fashion
,
she
breed
up
the
child
she
take
with
a
great
deal
of
art
,
as
well
as
with
a
great
deal
of
care
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
which
be
worth
all
the
rest
,
she
breed
them
up
very
religiously
,
be
herself
a
very
sober
,
pious
woman
,
very
house
-
wifely
and
clean
,
and
very
mannerly
,
and
with
good
behaviour
.
<EOS>
so
that
in
a
word
,
expect
a
plain
diet
,
coarse
lodging
,
and
mean
clothe
,
we
be
bring
up
as
mannerly
and
as
genteelly
as
if
we
have
be
at
the
dancing
-
school
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
continue
here
till
I
be
eight
year
old
,
when
I
be
terrified
with
news
that
the
magistrate
(
as
I
think
they
call
them
)
have
order
that
I
should
go
to
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
able
to
do
but
<EOS>
very
little
service
wherever
I
be
to
go
,
except
it
be
to
run
of
errand
and
be
a
drudge
to
some
cookmaid
,
and
this
<EOS>
they
tell
me
of
often
,
which
put
me
into
a
great
fright
;
for
I
have
a
thorough
aversion
to
go
to
service
,
as
they
call
it
(
that
is
,
to
be
a
servant
)
,
though
I
be
so
young
;
and
I
tell
my
nurse
,
as
we
call
her
,
that
I
believe
I
could
get
my
living
without
go
to
service
,
if
she
please
to
let
me
;
for
she
have
teach
me
to
work
with
my
needle
,
and
spin
worst
,
which
be
the
chief
trade
of
that
city
,
and
I
tell
her
that
if
she
would
keep
me
,
I
would
work
for
her
,
and
I
would
work
very
hard
.
  
<EOS>
I
talk
to
her
almost
every
day
of
work
hard
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
do
nothing
but
work
and
cry
all
day
,
which
grieve
the
good
,
kind
woman
so
much
,
that
at
last
she
begin
to
be
concern
for
me
,
for
she
love
me
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
after
this
,
as
she
come
into
the
room
where
all
we
poor
child
be
at
work
,
she
sit
down
just
over
against
me
,
not
in
her
usual
place
as
mistress
,
but
as
if
she
set
herself
on
purpose
to
observe
me
and
see
me
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
do
something
she
have
set
me
to
;
as
I
remember
,
it
be
mark
some
shirt
which
she
have
take
to
make
,
and
after
a
while
she
begin
to
talk
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
foolish
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
thou
art
always
cry
(
for
I
be
cry
then
)
;
"
prithee
,
what
dost
cry
for
?
"
<EOS>
"
because
they
will
take
me
away
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
put
me
to
service
,
and
I
can
not
work
housework
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
but
though
you
can
not
work
housework
,
as
you
call
it
,
you
will
learn
it
in
time
,
and
they
will
not
put
you
to
hard
thing
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
will
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
if
I
can
not
do
it
they
will
beat
me
,
and
the
maid
will
beat
me
to
make
me
do
great
work
,
and
I
be
but
a
little
girl
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
do
it
"
;
and
then
I
cry
again
,
till
I
could
not
speak
any
more
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
move
my
good
motherly
nurse
,
so
that
she
from
that
time
resolve
I
should
not
go
to
service
yet
;
so
she
bid
me
not
cry
,
and
she
would
speak
to
Mr.
Mayor
,
and
I
should
not
go
to
service
till
I
be
big
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
this
do
not
satisfy
me
,
for
to
think
of
go
to
service
<EOS>
be
such
a
frightful
thing
to
me
,
that
if
she
have
assure
me
I
should
not
have
go
till
I
be
twenty
year
old
,
it
would
have
be
the
same
to
me
;
I
should
have
cry
,
I
believe
,
all
the
time
,
with
the
very
apprehension
of
its
be
to
be
so
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
see
that
I
be
not
pacify
yet
,
she
begin
to
be
angry
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
would
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
;
"
do
not
I
tell
you
that
you
shall
not
go
to
service
till
your
be
big
?
"
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
but
then
I
must
go
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
;
"
be
the
girl
mad
?
 
<EOS>
what
would
you
be
   
a
gentlewoman
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
and
cry
heartily
till
I
roar
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
this
set
the
old
gentlewoman
a
-
laughing
at
me
,
as
you
may
be
sure
it
would
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
,
forsooth
,
"
say
she
,
gibe
at
me
<EOS>
,
"
you
would
be
a
gentlewoman
;
and
pray
how
will
you
come
to
be
a
gentlewoman
?
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
will
you
do
it
by
your
finger
"
end
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
again
,
very
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
can
you
earn
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
;
"
what
can
you
get
at
your
work
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
threepence
,
"
say
I
,
"
when
I
spin
,
and
fourpence
when
I
work
plain
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
poor
gentlewoman
,
"
say
she
again
,
laugh
,
"
what
will
that
do
for
thee
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
keep
me
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
you
will
let
me
live
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
this
I
say
in
such
a
poor
petition
tone
,
that
it
make
the
poor
woman
's
heart
yearn
to
me
,
as
she
tell
me
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
will
not
keep
you
and
buy
you
clothe
too
;
and
who
must
buy
the
little
gentlewoman
clothe
?
"
say
she
,
and
smile
all
the
while
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
work
harder
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
you
shall
have
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
child
!
<EOS>
it
will
not
keep
you
,
"
say
she
;
"
it
will
hardly
keep
you
in
victual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
have
no
victual
,
"
say
I
,
again
very
innocently
;
"
let
me
but
live
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
can
you
live
without
victual
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
again
say
I
,
very
much
like
a
child
,
you
may
be
sure
,
and
still
I
cry
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
policy
in
all
this
;
you
may
easily
see
it
be
all
nature
;
but
it
be
join
with
so
much
innocence
and
so
much
passion
that
,
in
short
,
it
set
the
good
motherly
creature
a
-
weeping
too
,
and
she
cry
at
last
as
fast
as
I
do
,
and
then
take
me
and
lead
me
out
of
the
teaching
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
shall
not
go
to
service
;
you
shall
live
with
me
"
;
and
this
pacify
me
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
,
she
go
to
wait
on
the
Mayor
,
and
talk
of
such
thing
as
belong
to
her
business
,
at
last
my
story
come
up
,
and
my
good
nurse
tell
Mr.
Mayor
the
whole
tale
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
pleased
with
it
,
that
he
would
call
his
lady
and
his
two
daughter
to
hear
it
,
and
it
make
mirth
enough
among
them
,
you
may
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
not
a
week
have
pass
over
,
but
on
a
sudden
come
Mrs.
Mayoress
and
her
two
daughter
to
the
house
to
see
my
old
nurse
,
and
to
see
her
school
and
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
look
about
them
a
little
,
"
well
,
Mrs.
#
#
#
#
,
"
say
the
Mayoress
to
my
nurse
,
"
and
pray
which
be
the
little
lass
that
intend
to
be
a
gentlewoman
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
hear
her
,
and
I
be
terribly
fright
at
first
,
though
I
do
not
know
why
neither
;
but
Mrs.
Mayoress
come
up
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
miss
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
what
be
you
at
work
upon
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
word
miss
be
a
language
that
have
hardly
be
hear
of
in
our
school
,
and
I
wonder
what
sad
name
<EOS>
it
be
she
call
me
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
stand
up
,
make
a
curtsy
,
and
she
take
my
work
out
of
my
hand
,
look
on
it
,
and
say
it
be
very
well
;
then
she
take
up
one
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
"
say
she
,
"
the
child
may
come
to
be
a
gentlewoman
for
aught
anybody
know
;
she
have
a
gentlewoman
's
hand
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
this
please
me
mightily
<EOS>
,
you
may
be
sure
;
but
Mrs.
Mayoress
do
not
stop
there
,
but
give
me
my
work
again
,
she
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
,
give
me
a
shilling
,
and
bid
me
mind
my
work
,
and
learn
to
work
well
,
and
I
may
be
a
gentlewoman
for
aught
she
know
.
  
<EOS>
now
all
this
while
my
good
old
nurse
,
Mrs.
Mayoress
,
and
all
the
rest
of
them
do
not
understand
me
at
all
,
for
they
mean
one
sort
of
thing
by
the
word
gentlewoman
,
and
I
mean
quite
another
;
for
alas
!
<EOS>
all
I
understand
by
be
a
gentlewoman
be
to
be
able
to
work
for
myself
,
and
get
enough
to
keep
me
without
that
terrible
bugbear
go
to
service
,
whereas
they
mean
to
live
great
,
rich
and
high
,
and
I
know
not
what
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
after
Mrs.
Mayoress
be
go
,
her
two
daughter
come
in
,
and
they
call
for
the
gentlewoman
too
,
and
they
talk
a
long
while
to
me
,
and
I
answer
them
in
my
innocent
way
;
but
always
,
<EOS>
if
they
ask
me
whether
I
resolve
to
be
a
gentlewoman
,
I
answer
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
one
of
them
ask
me
what
a
gentlewoman
be
?
 
<EOS>
that
puzzle
me
much
;
but
,
however
,
I
explain
myself
negatively
,
that
it
be
one
that
do
not
go
to
service
,
to
do
housework
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
pleased
to
be
familiar
with
me
,
and
like
my
little
prattle
to
them
,
which
,
it
seem
,
be
agreeable
enough
to
them
,
and
they
give
me
money
too
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
my
money
,
I
give
it
all
to
my
mistress
-
nurse
,
as
I
call
her
,
and
tell
her
she
should
have
all
I
get
for
myself
when
I
be
a
gentlewoman
,
as
well
as
now
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
and
some
other
of
my
talk
,
my
old
tutoress
begin
to
understand
me
about
what
I
mean
by
be
a
gentlewoman
,
and
that
I
understand
by
it
no
more
than
to
be
able
to
get
my
bread
by
my
own
work
;
and
at
last
she
ask
me
whether
it
be
not
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
yes
,
and
insist
on
it
,
that
to
do
so
be
to
be
a
gentlewoman
;
"
for
,
"
say
I
,
"
there
be
such
a
one
,
"
name
a
woman
that
mend
lace
and
wash
the
lady
'
lace
-
head
;
"
she
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
a
gentlewoman
,
and
they
call
her
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
child
,
"
say
my
good
old
nurse
,
"
you
may
soon
be
such
a
gentlewoman
as
that
,
for
she
be
a
person
of
ill
fame
,
and
have
have
two
or
three
bastard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
anything
of
that
;
but
I
answer
,
"
I
be
sure
they
call
her
madam
,
and
she
do
not
go
to
service
nor
do
housework
"
;
and
therefore
I
insist
that
she
be
a
gentlewoman
,
and
I
would
be
such
a
gentlewoman
as
that
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
be
tell
all
this
again
,
to
be
sure
,
and
they
make
themselves
merry
with
it
,
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
the
young
lady
,
Mr.
Mayor
's
daughter
,
would
come
and
see
me
,
and
ask
where
the
little
gentlewoman
be
,
which
make
me
not
a
little
proud
of
myself
.
  
<EOS>
this
hold
a
great
while
,
and
I
be
often
visit
by
these
young
lady
,
and
sometimes
they
bring
other
with
them
;
so
that
I
be
know
by
it
almost
all
over
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
about
ten
year
old
,
and
begin
to
look
a
little
womanish
,
for
I
be
mighty
grave
and
humble
,
very
mannerly
,
and
as
I
have
often
hear
the
lady
say
I
be
pretty
,
and
would
be
a
very
handsome
woman
,
so
you
may
be
sure
that
hear
them
say
so
make
me
not
a
little
proud
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
that
pride
have
no
ill
effect
upon
me
yet
;
only
,
as
they
often
give
me
money
,
and
I
give
it
to
my
old
nurse
,
she
,
honest
woman
,
be
so
just
to
me
as
to
lay
it
all
out
again
for
me
,
and
give
me
head
-
dress
,
and
linen
,
and
glove
,
and
ribbon
,
and
I
go
very
neat
,
and
always
clean
;
for
that
I
would
do
,
and
if
I
have
rag
on
,
I
would
always
be
clean
,
or
else
I
would
dabble
them
in
water
myself
;
but
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
my
good
nurse
,
when
I
have
money
give
me
,
very
honestly
lay
it
out
for
me
,
and
would
always
tell
the
lady
this
or
that
be
buy
with
their
money
;
and
this
make
them
oftentime
give
me
more
,
till
at
last
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
call
upon
by
the
magistrate
,
as
I
understand
it
,
to
go
out
to
service
;
but
then
I
be
come
to
be
so
good
<EOS>
a
workwoman
myself
,
and
<EOS>
the
lady
be
so
kind
to
me
,
that
it
be
plain
<EOS>
I
could
maintain
myself
 
that
be
to
say
,
I
could
earn
as
much
for
my
nurse
as
she
be
able
by
it
to
keep
me
 
<EOS>
so
she
tell
them
that
if
they
would
give
her
leave
,
she
would
keep
the
gentlewoman
,
as
she
call
me
,
to
be
her
assistant
and
teach
the
child
,
which
I
be
very
well
able
to
do
;
for
I
be
very
nimble
at
my
work
,
and
have
a
good
hand
with
my
needle
,
though
I
be
yet
very
young
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
kindness
of
the
lady
of
the
town
do
not
end
here
,
for
when
they
come
to
understand
that
I
be
no
more
maintain
by
the
public
allowance
as
before
,
they
give
me
money
oftener
than
formerly
;
and
as
I
grow
up
they
bring
me
work
to
do
for
them
,
such
as
linen
to
make
,
and
lace
to
mend
,
and
head
to
dress
up
,
and
not
only
pay
me
for
do
them
,
but
even
teach
me
how
to
do
them
;
so
that
now
I
be
a
gentlewoman
indeed
,
as
I
understand
that
word
<EOS>
,
I
not
only
find
myself
clothe
and
pay
my
nurse
for
my
keeping
,
but
get
money
in
my
pocket
too
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
also
give
me
clothe
frequently
of
their
own
or
their
child
<EOS>
's
;
some
stocking
,
some
petticoat
,
some
gown
,
some
one
thing
,
some
another
,
and
these
my
old
woman
manage
for
me
like
a
mere
mother
,
and
keep
them
for
me
,
oblige
me
to
mend
them
,
and
turn
them
and
twist
them
to
the
good
advantage
,
for
she
be
a
rare
housewife
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
one
of
the
lady
take
so
much
fancy
to
me
that
she
would
have
me
home
to
her
house
,
for
a
month
,
she
say
,
to
be
among
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
though
this
be
exceed
kind
in
her
,
yet
,
as
my
old
good
woman
say
to
her
,
unless
she
resolve
to
keep
me
for
good
and
all
,
she
would
do
the
little
gentlewoman
more
harm
than
good
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
that
be
true
;
and
therefore
I
will
only
take
her
home
for
a
week
,
then
,
that
I
may
see
how
my
daughter
and
she
agree
together
,
and
how
I
like
her
temper
,
and
then
I
will
tell
you
more
;
and
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
if
anybody
come
to
see
her
as
they
use
to
do
,
you
may
only
tell
them
you
have
send
her
out
to
my
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
prudently
manage
enough
,
and
I
go
to
the
lady
's
house
;
but
I
be
so
pleased
there
with
the
young
lady
,
and
they
so
please
with
me
,
that
I
have
enough
to
do
to
come
away
,
and
they
be
as
unwilling
to
part
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
come
away
,
and
live
almost
a
year
more
with
my
honest
old
woman
,
and
begin
now
to
be
very
helpful
to
her
;
for
I
be
almost
fourteen
year
old
,
be
tall
of
my
age
,
and
look
a
little
womanish
;
but
I
have
such
a
taste
of
genteel
live
at
the
lady
's
house
that
I
be
not
so
easy
in
my
old
quarter
as
I
use
to
be
,
and
I
think
it
be
fine
to
be
a
gentlewoman
indeed
,
for
I
have
quite
other
notion
of
a
gentlewoman
now
than
I
have
before
;
and
as
I
think
,
I
say
,
that
it
be
fine
to
be
a
gentlewoman
,
so
I
love
to
be
among
gentlewoman
,
and
therefore
I
long
to
be
there
again
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
time
that
I
be
fourteen
year
and
a
quarter
old
,
my
good
nurse
,
mother
I
rather
to
call
her
,
fall
sick
and
die
.
<EOS>
I
be
then
in
a
sad
condition
indeed
,
for
as
there
be
no
great
bustle
in
put
an
end
to
a
poor
body
's
family
when
once
they
be
carry
to
the
grave
,
so
the
poor
good
woman
be
bury
,
the
parish
child
she
keep
be
immediately
remove
by
the
church
-
warden
;
the
school
be
at
an
end
,
and
the
child
of
it
have
no
more
to
do
but
just
stay
at
home
till
they
be
send
somewhere
else
;
and
as
for
what
she
leave
,
her
daughter
,
a
married
woman
with
six
or
seven
child
,
come
and
sweep
it
all
away
at
once
,
and
remove
the
good
,
they
have
no
more
to
say
to
me
than
to
jest
with
me
,
and
tell
me
that
the
little
gentlewoman
may
set
up
for
herself
if
she
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
fright
out
of
my
wit
almost
,
and
know
not
what
to
do
,
for
I
be
,
as
it
be
,
turn
out
of
door
to
the
wide
world
,
and
that
which
be
still
bad
,
the
old
honest
woman
have
two
-
and-
twenty
shilling
of
mine
in
her
hand
,
which
be
all
the
estate
the
little
gentlewoman
have
in
the
world
;
and
when
I
ask
the
daughter
for
it
,
she
huff
me
and
laugh
at
me
,
and
tell
me
she
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
the
good
,
poor
woman
have
tell
her
daughter
of
it
,
and
that
it
lie
in
such
a
place
,
that
it
be
the
child
's
money
,
and
 
have
call
once
or
twice
for
me
to
give
it
me
,
but
I
be
,
unhappily
,
out
of
the
way
somewhere
or
other
,
and
when
I
come
back
<EOS>
she
be
past
be
in
a
condition
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
daughter
be
so
honest
afterwards
as
to
give
it
me
,
though
at
first
she
use
me
cruelly
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
be
I
a
poor
gentlewoman
indeed
,
and
I
be
just
that
very
night
to
be
turn
into
the
wide
world
;
for
the
daughter
remove
all
the
good
,
and
I
have
not
so
much
as
a
lodging
to
go
to
,
or
a
bit
of
bread
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
some
of
the
neighbour
,
who
have
know
my
circumstance
,
take
so
much
compassion
of
me
as
to
acquaint
the
lady
in
whose
family
I
have
be
a
week
,
as
I
mention
above
;
and
immediately
she
send
her
maid
to
fetch
me
away
,
and
two
of
her
daughter
come
with
the
maid
though
unsent
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
with
them
,
bag
and
baggage
,
and
with
a
glad
heart
,
you
may
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
the
fright
of
my
condition
have
make
such
an
impression
upon
me
,
that
I
do
not
want
now
to
be
a
gentlewoman
,
but
be
very
willing
to
be
a
servant
,
and
that
any
kind
of
servant
they
think
fit
to
have
me
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
new
generous
mistress
,
for
she
exceed
the
good
woman
I
be
with
before
,
in
everything
,
as
well
as
in
the
matter
of
estate
;
I
say
,
in
everything
except
honesty
;
and
for
that
,
though
this
be
a
lady
most
exactly
just
,
yet
I
must
not
forget
to
say
on
all
occasion
,
that
the
first
,
though
poor
,
be
as
uprightly
honest
as
it
be
possible
for
any
one
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
no
sooner
carry
away
,
as
I
have
say
,
by
this
good
gentlewoman
,
but
the
first
lady
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
Mayoress
that
be
,
send
her
two
daughter
to
take
care
of
me
;
and
another
family
which
have
take
notice
of
me
when
I
be
the
little
gentlewoman
,
and
have
give
me
work
to
do
,
send
for
me
after
her
,
so
that
I
be
mightily
make
of
,
as
we
say
;
nay
,
and
they
be
not
a
little
angry
,
especially
madam
the
Mayoress
,
that
her
friend
have
take
me
away
from
her
,
as
she
call
it
;
<EOS>
for
,
as
she
say
,
I
be
her
by
right
,
she
have
be
the
first
that
take
any
notice
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
that
have
me
would
not
part
with
me
;
and
as
for
me
,
though
I
should
have
be
very
well
treat
with
any
of
the
other
,
yet
I
could
not
be
well
than
where
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
continue
till
I
be
between
seventeen
and
eighteen
year
old
,
and
here
I
have
all
the
advantage
for
my
education
that
could
be
imagine
;
the
lady
have
master
home
to
the
house
to
teach
her
daughter
to
dance
,
and
to
speak
French
,
and
to
write
,
and
other
to
teach
them
music
;
and
I
be
always
with
them
<EOS>
,
I
learn
as
fast
as
they
;
and
though
the
master
be
not
appoint
to
teach
me
,
yet
I
learn
by
imitation
and
inquiry
all
that
they
learn
by
instruction
and
direction
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
I
learn
to
dance
and
speak
French
as
well
as
any
of
them
,
and
to
sing
much
well
,
for
I
have
a
well
voice
than
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
so
readily
come
at
play
on
the
harpsichord
or
spinet
,
because
I
have
no
instrument
of
my
own
to
practice
on
,
and
could
only
come
at
theirs
in
the
interval
when
they
leave
it
,
which
be
uncertain
;
but
yet
I
learn
tolerably
well
too
,
and
the
young
lady
at
length
get
two
instrument
,
that
be
to
say
,
a
harpsichord
and
a
spinet
too
,
and
then
they
teach
me
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
to
dancing
,
they
could
hardly
help
my
learn
country
-
dance
,
because
they
always
want
me
to
make
up
even
number
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
be
as
heartily
willing
to
learn
me
everything
that
they
have
be
teach
themselves
,
as
I
could
be
to
take
the
learning
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
means
I
have
,
as
I
have
say
above
,
all
the
advantage
of
education
that
I
could
have
have
if
I
have
be
as
much
a
gentlewoman
as
they
be
with
whom
I
live
;
and
in
some
thing
I
have
the
advantage
of
my
lady
,
though
they
be
my
superior
;
but
they
be
all
the
gift
of
nature
,
and
which
all
their
fortune
could
not
furnish
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
I
be
apparently
handsome
than
any
of
them
;
secondly
,
I
be
better
shape
;
and
,
thirdly
,
I
sing
better
,
by
which
I
mean
I
have
a
well
voice
;
in
all
which
you
will
,
I
hope
,
allow
me
to
say
,
I
do
not
speak
my
own
conceit
of
myself
,
but
the
opinion
of
all
that
know
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
with
all
these
the
common
vanity
of
my
sex
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
be
really
take
for
very
handsome
,
or
,
if
you
please
,
for
a
great
beauty
,
I
very
well
know
it
,
and
have
as
good
an
opinion
of
myself
as
anybody
else
could
have
of
me
;
and
particularly
I
love
to
hear
anybody
speak
of
it
,
which
could
not
but
happen
to
me
sometimes
,
and
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
thus
far
I
have
have
a
smooth
story
to
tell
of
myself
,
and
in
all
this
part
of
my
life
I
not
only
have
the
reputation
of
live
in
a
very
good
family
,
and
a
family
note
and
respect
everywhere
for
virtue
and
sobriety
,
and
for
every
valuable
thing
;
but
I
have
the
character
too
of
a
very
sober
,
modest
,
and
virtuous
young
woman
,
and
such
I
have
always
be
;
neither
have
I
yet
any
occasion
to
think
of
anything
else
,
or
to
know
what
a
temptation
to
wickedness
mean
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
which
I
be
too
vain
of
be
my
ruin
,
or
<EOS>
rather
my
vanity
be
the
cause
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
in
the
house
where
I
be
have
two
son
,
young
gentleman
of
very
promising
part
and
of
extraordinary
behaviour
,
and
it
be
my
misfortune
to
be
very
well
with
them
both
,
but
they
manage
themselves
with
me
in
a
quite
different
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
eld
,
a
gay
gentleman
that
know
the
town
as
well
as
the
country
,
and
though
he
have
levity
enough
to
do
an
ill
-
natured
thing
,
yet
have
too
much
judgment
of
thing
to
pay
too
dear
for
his
pleasure
;
he
begin
with
the
unhappy
snare
to
all
woman
,
viz
.
<EOS>
take
notice
upon
all
occasion
how
pretty
I
be
,
as
he
call
it
,
how
agreeable
,
how
well
-
carriage
,
and
the
like
;
and
this
he
contrive
so
subtly
,
as
if
he
have
know
as
well
how
to
catch
a
woman
in
his
net
as
a
partridge
when
he
go
a
-
setting
;
for
he
would
contrive
to
be
talk
this
to
his
sister
when
,
though
I
be
not
by
,
yet
when
he
know
I
be
not
far
off
but
<EOS>
that
I
should
be
sure
to
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
sister
would
return
softly
to
him
,
"
Hush
,
brother
,
she
will
hear
you
;
she
be
but
in
the
next
room
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
would
put
it
off
and
talk
softli
,
as
if
he
have
not
know
it
,
and
begin
to
acknowledge
he
be
wrong
;
and
then
,
as
if
he
have
forget
himself
,
he
would
speak
aloud
again
,
and
<EOS>
I
,
that
be
so
well
pleased
to
hear
it
,
be
sure
to
listen
for
it
upon
all
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
after
he
have
thus
bait
his
hook
,
and
find
easily
enough
the
method
how
to
lay
it
in
my
way
,
he
play
an
opener
game
;
and
one
day
,
go
by
his
sister
's
chamber
when
I
be
there
,
do
something
about
dress
her
,
he
come
in
with
an
air
of
gaiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mrs.
Betty
,
"
say
he
to
me
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Betty
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
your
cheek
burn
,
Mrs.
Betty
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
curtsy
and
blush
,
but
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
talk
so
,
brother
?
"
say
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
have
be
talk
of
her
below
-
stair
this
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
his
sister
,
"
you
can
say
no
harm
of
her
,
that
I
be
sure
,
<EOS>
so
'
tis
no
matter
what
you
have
be
talk
about
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
'
tis
so
far
from
talk
harm
of
her
,
that
we
have
be
talk
a
great
deal
of
good
,
and
a
great
many
fine
thing
have
be
say
of
Mrs.
Betty
,
I
assure
you
;
and
particularly
,
that
she
be
the
handsome
young
woman
in
Colchester
;
and
,
in
short
,
they
begin
to
toast
her
health
in
the
town
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
you
,
brother
,
"
say
the
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
Betty
want
but
one
thing
,
but
she
have
as
good
want
everything
,
for
the
market
be
against
our
sex
just
now
;
and
if
a
young
woman
have
beauty
,
birth
,
breeding
,
wit
,
sense
,
manner
,
modesty
,
and
all
these
to
an
extreme
,
yet
if
she
have
not
money
,
she
be
nobody
<EOS>
,
she
have
as
good
want
them
all
for
nothing
but
money
now
recommend
a
woman
;
the
man
play
the
game
all
into
their
own
hand

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
young
brother
,
who
be
by
,
cry
,
"
hold
,
sister
,
<EOS>
you
run
too
fast
;
I
be
an
exception
to
your
rule
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
if
I
find
a
woman
so
accomplished
as
you
talk
of
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
I
assure
you
,
I
would
not
trouble
myself
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
the
sister
,
"
but
you
will
take
care
not
to
fancy
one
,
then
,
without
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
that
neither
,
"
say
the
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
,
sister
,
"
say
the
eld
brother
,
"
why
do
you
exclaim
so
at
the
man
for
aim
so
much
at
the
fortune
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
none
of
them
that
want
a
fortune
,
whatever
else
you
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
brother
,
"
reply
the
lady
very
smartly
;
"
you
suppose
I
have
the
money
,
and
want
the
beauty
;
but
as
time
go
now
,
the
first
will
do
without
the
last
,
so
I
have
the
well
of
my
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
young
brother
,
"
but
your
neighbour
,
as
you
call
them
,
may
be
even
with
you
,
for
beauty
will
steal
a
husband
sometimes
in
spite
of
money
,
and
when
the
maid
chance
to
be
handsome
than
the
mistress
,
she
oftentimes
make
as
good
a
market
,
and
ride
in
a
coach
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
time
for
me
to
withdraw
and
leave
them
,
and
I
do
so
,
but
not
so
far
but
<EOS>
that
I
hear
all
their
discourse
,
in
which
I
hear
abundance
of
the
fine
thing
say
of
myself
,
which
serve
to
prompt
my
vanity
,
but
,
as
I
soon
find
,
be
not
the
way
to
increase
my
interest
in
the
family
,
for
the
sister
and
the
young
brother
<EOS>
fall
grievously
out
about
it
;
and
as
he
say
some
very
disoblige
thing
to
her
upon
my
account
,
so
I
could
easily
see
that
she
resent
them
by
her
future
conduct
to
me
,
which
indeed
be
very
unjust
to
me
,
for
I
have
never
have
the
least
thought
of
what
she
suspect
as
to
her
young
brother
;
indeed
,
the
eld
brother
,
in
his
distant
,
remote
way
,
have
say
a
great
many
thing
as
in
jest
,
which
I
have
the
folly
to
believe
be
in
earnest
,
or
to
flatter
myself
with
the
hope
of
what
I
ought
to
have
suppose
he
never
intend
,
and
perhaps
never
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
one
day
that
he
come
run
upstairs
,
towards
the
room
where
his
sister
use
to
sit
and
work
,
as
he
often
use
to
do
;
and
call
to
them
before
he
come
in
,
as
be
his
way
too
,
I
,
be
there
alone
,
step
to
the
door
,
and
say
,
"
Sir
,
the
lady
be
not
here
,
they
be
walk
down
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
as
I
step
forward
to
say
this
,
towards
the
door
,
he
be
just
get
to
the
door
,
and
clasp
me
in
his
arm
,
as
if
it
have
be
by
chance
,
"
oh
,
Mrs.
Betty
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
well
still
;
I
want
to
speak
with
you
more
than
I
do
with
them
"
;
and
then
,
have
me
in
his
arm
,
he
kiss
me
three
or
four
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
struggle
to
get
away
,
and
yet
do
it
but
faintly
neither
,
and
he
hold
me
fast
,
and
still
kiss
me
,
till
he
be
almost
out
of
breath
,
and
then
,
sit
down
,
say
,
"
Dear
Betty
,
I
be
in
love
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
word
,
I
must
confess
,
fire
my
blood
;
all
my
spirit
fly
about
my
heart
and
put
me
into
disorder
enough
,
which
he
may
easily
have
see
in
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
repeat
it
afterwards
several
time
,
that
he
be
in
love
with
me
,
and
my
heart
speak
as
plain
as
a
voice
,
that
I
like
it
;
nay
,
whenever
he
say
,
"
I
be
in
love
with
you
,
"
my
blush
plainly
reply
,
"
Would
you
be
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
however
,
nothing
else
pass
at
that
time
;
it
be
but
a
sur
-
prise
,
and
when
he
be
go
I
soon
recover
myself
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
stay
longer
with
me
,
but
he
happen
to
look
out
at
the
window
and
see
his
sister
come
up
the
garden
,
so
he
take
his
leave
,
kiss
me
again
,
tell
me
he
be
very
serious
,
and
I
should
hear
more
of
him
very
quickly
,
and
away
he
go
,
leave
me
infinitely
pleased
,
though
surprised
;
and
have
there
not
be
one
misfortune
in
it
<EOS>
,
I
have
be
in
the
right
,
but
the
mistake
lie
here
,
that
Mrs.
Betty
be
in
earnest
and
the
gentleman
be
not
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
time
my
head
run
upon
strange
thing
,
and
I
may
truly
say
I
be
not
myself
;
to
have
such
a
gentleman
talk
to
me
of
be
in
love
with
me
,
and
of
my
be
such
a
charming
creature
,
as
he
tell
me
I
be
;
these
be
thing
I
know
not
how
to
bear
,
my
vanity
be
elevate
to
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
<EOS>
I
have
my
head
full
of
pride
,
but
<EOS>
,
know
nothing
of
the
wickedness
of
the
time
,
I
have
not
one
thought
of
my
own
safety
or
of
my
virtue
about
me
;
and
have
my
young
master
offer
it
at
first
sight
,
he
may
have
take
any
liberty
he
think
fit
with
me
;
but
he
do
not
see
his
advantage
,
which
be
my
happiness
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
attack
it
be
not
long
but
he
find
an
opportunity
to
catch
me
again
,
and
almost
in
the
same
posture
;
indeed
,
it
have
more
of
design
in
it
on
his
part
,
though
not
on
my
part
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
thus
:
 
the
young
lady
be
all
go
a
-
visit
with
their
mother
;
his
brother
be
out
of
town
;
and
as
for
his
father
,
he
have
be
in
London
for
a
week
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
so
well
watch
me
that
he
know
where
I
be
,
though
I
do
not
so
much
as
know
that
he
be
in
the
house
;
and
he
briskly
come
up
the
stair
and
,
see
me
at
work
,
come
into
the
room
to
me
directly
,
and
begin
just
as
he
do
before
,
with
take
me
in
his
arm
,
and
kiss
me
for
almost
a
quarter
of
an
hour
together
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
his
young
sister
's
chamber
that
I
be
in
,
and
as
there
be
nobody
in
the
house
but
the
maid
below
-
stair
,
he
be
,
it
may
be
,
the
ruder
;
in
short
,
he
begin
to
be
in
earnest
with
me
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
find
me
a
little
too
easy
,
for
God
know
I
make
no
resistance
to
him
while
he
only
hold
me
in
his
arm
and
kiss
me
;
indeed
,
I
be
too
well
pleased
with
it
to
resist
him
much
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
it
be
,
tired
with
that
kind
of
work
,
we
sit
down
,
and
there
he
talk
with
me
a
great
while
;
he
say
he
be
charm
with
me
,
and
that
he
could
not
rest
night
or
day
till
he
have
tell
me
how
he
be
in
love
with
me
,
and
,
if
I
be
able
to
love
him
again
,
and
would
make
him
happy
,
I
should
be
the
saving
of
his
life
,
and
<EOS>
many
such
fine
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
little
to
him
again
,
but
easily
discover
that
I
be
a
fool
,
and
that
I
do
not
in
the
least
perceive
what
he
mean
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
walk
about
the
room
,
and
take
me
by
the
hand
,
I
walk
with
him
;
and
by
and
by
,
take
his
advantage
,
he
throw
me
down
upon
the
bed
,
and
kiss
me
there
most
violently
;
but
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
offer
no
manner
of
rudeness
to
me
,
only
kiss
a
great
while
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
he
think
he
have
hear
somebody
come
upstairs
,
so
get
off
from
the
bed
,
lift
me
up
,
profess
a
great
deal
of
love
for
me
,
but
tell
me
it
be
all
an
honest
affection
,
and
that
he
mean
no
ill
to
me
;
and
with
that
he
put
five
guinea
into
my
hand
,
and
go
away
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
more
confound
with
the
money
than
I
be
before
with
the
love
,
and
begin
to
be
so
elevated
that
I
scarce
know
the
ground
I
stand
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
more
particular
in
this
part
,
that
if
my
story
come
to
be
read
by
any
innocent
young
body
,
they
may
learn
from
it
to
guard
themselves
against
the
mischief
which
attend
an
early
knowledge
of
their
own
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
young
woman
once
think
herself
handsome
,
she
never
doubt
the
truth
of
any
man
that
tell
her
he
be
in
love
with
her
;
for
if
she
believe
herself
charm
enough
to
captivate
him
,
'
tis
natural
to
expect
the
effect
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
young
gentleman
have
fire
his
inclination
as
much
as
he
have
my
vanity
,
and
,
as
if
he
have
find
that
he
have
an
opportunity
and
be
sorry
he
do
not
take
hold
of
it
,
he
come
up
again
in
half
an
hour
or
thereabout
,
and
fall
to
work
with
me
again
as
before
,
only
with
a
little
less
introduction
.
  
<EOS>
and
first
,
when
he
enter
the
room
,
he
turn
about
and
shut
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Betty
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
fancy
before
somebody
be
come
upstairs
,
but
it
be
not
so
;
however
,
"
add
he
,
"
if
they
find
me
in
the
room
with
you
,
they
shall
not
catch
me
a
-
kissing
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
I
do
not
know
who
should
be
come
upstairs
,
for
I
believe
there
be
nobody
in
the
house
but
the
cook
and
the
other
maid
,
and
they
never
come
up
those
stair
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
'
tis
good
to
be
sure
,
however
"
;
and
so
he
sit
down
,
and
we
begin
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
though
I
be
still
all
on
fire
with
his
first
visit
,
and
say
little
,
he
do
as
it
be
put
word
in
my
mouth
,
tell
me
how
passionately
he
love
me
,
and
that
though
he
could
not
mention
such
a
thing
till
he
come
to
this
estate
,
yet
he
be
resolve
to
make
me
happy
then
,
and
himself
too
<EOS>
;
that
be
to
say
,
to
marry
me
,
and
abundance
of
such
fine
thing
,
which
I
,
poor
fool
,
do
not
understand
the
drift
of
,
but
act
as
if
there
be
no
such
thing
as
any
kind
of
love
but
that
which
tend
to
matrimony
;
and
if
he
have
speak
of
that
,
I
have
no
room
,
as
well
as
no
power
,
to
have
say
no
;
but
we
be
not
come
that
length
yet
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
not
sit
long
,
but
he
get
up
,
and
,
stop
my
very
breath
with
kiss
,
throw
me
upon
the
bed
again
;
but
then
be
both
well
warm
,
he
go
farther
with
me
than
decency
permit
me
to
mention
,
nor
have
it
be
in
my
power
to
have
deny
him
at
that
moment
,
<EOS>
have
he
offer
much
more
than
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
though
he
take
these
freedom
with
me
,
it
do
not
go
to
that
which
they
call
the
last
favour
,
which
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
do
not
attempt
;
and
he
make
that
self
-
denial
of
his
a
plea
for
all
his
freedom
with
me
upon
other
occasion
after
this
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
be
over
,
he
stay
but
a
little
while
,
but
he
put
almost
a
handful
of
gold
in
my
hand
,
and
leave
me
,
make
a
thousand
protestation
of
his
passion
for
me
,
and
of
his
love
me
above
all
the
woman
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
strange
if
I
now
begin
to
think
,
but
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
but
with
very
little
solid
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
most
unbounded
stock
of
vanity
and
pride
,
and
<EOS>
but
a
very
little
stock
of
virtue
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
case
sometimes
with
myself
what
young
master
aim
at
,
but
thought
of
nothing
but
the
fine
word
and
the
gold
;
whether
he
intend
to
marry
me
,
or
not
to
marry
me
,
seem
a
matter
of
no
great
consequence
to
me
;
nor
do
my
thought
so
much
as
sugg
to
me
the
necessity
of
make
any
capitulation
for
myself
,
till
he
come
to
make
a
kind
of
formal
proposal
to
me
,
as
you
shall
hear
presently
.
  
<EOS>
thus
I
give
up
myself
to
a
readiness
of
be
ruin
without
the
least
concern
and
be
a
fair
memento
to
all
young
woman
whose
vanity
prevail
over
their
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
be
ever
so
stupid
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
act
as
become
me
,
and
resist
as
virtue
and
honour
require
,
this
gentleman
have
either
desist
his
attack
,
find
no
room
to
expect
the
accomplishment
of
his
design
,
or
have
make
fair
and
honourable
proposal
of
marriage
;
in
which
case
,
whoever
have
blame
him
,
nobody
could
have
blame
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
if
he
have
know
me
,
and
how
easy
the
trifle
he
aim
at
be
to
be
have
,
he
would
have
trouble
his
head
no
farther
,
but
have
give
me
four
or
five
guinea
,
and
have
lie
with
me
the
next
time
he
have
come
at
me
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
have
know
his
thought
,
and
how
hard
he
think
I
would
be
to
be
gain
,
I
may
have
make
my
own
term
with
him
;
and
if
I
have
not
capitulate
for
an
immediate
marriage
,
I
may
for
a
maintenance
till
marriage
,
and
may
have
have
what
I
would
;
for
he
be
already
rich
to
excess
,
besides
what
he
have
in
expectation
;
but
I
seem
wholly
to
have
abandon
all
such
thought
as
these
,
and
be
take
up
only
with
the
pride
of
my
beauty
,
and
of
be
beloved
by
such
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
gold
,
I
spend
whole
hour
in
look
upon
it
;
I
tell
the
guinea
over
and
over
a
thousand
time
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
never
poor
vain
creature
be
so
wrapt
up
with
every
part
of
the
story
as
I
be
,
not
consider
what
be
before
me
,
and
how
near
my
ruin
be
at
the
door
;
indeed
,
I
think
I
rather
wish
for
that
ruin
than
study
to
avoid
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
however
,
I
be
cunne
enough
not
to
give
the
least
room
to
any
in
the
family
to
suspect
me
,
or
to
imagine
that
I
have
the
least
correspondence
with
this
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
scarce
ever
look
towards
him
in
public
,
or
answer
if
he
speak
to
me
when
anybody
be
near
us
;
but
for
all
that
,
we
have
every
now
and
then
a
little
encounter
,
where
we
have
room
for
a
word
or
two
,
an
now
and
then
a
kiss
,
but
no
fair
opportunity
for
the
mischief
intend
;
and
especially
consider
that
he
make
more
circumlocution
than
,
if
he
have
know
by
thought
,
he
have
occasion
for
;
and
the
work
appear
difficult
to
him
,
he
really
make
it
so
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
the
devil
be
an
unwearied
tempter
,
so
he
never
fail
to
find
opportunity
for
that
wickedness
he
invite
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
evening
that
I
be
in
the
garden
,
with
his
two
young
sister
and
himself
,
and
all
very
innocently
merry
,
when
he
find
mean
to
convey
a
note
into
my
hand
,
by
which
he
direct
me
to
understand
that
he
would
to
-
morrow
desire
me
publicly
to
go
of
an
errand
for
him
into
the
town
,
and
that
I
should
see
him
somewhere
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
after
dinner
,
he
very
gravely
say
to
me
,
his
sister
be
all
by
,
"
Mrs.
Betty
,
I
must
ask
a
favour
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
say
his
second
sister
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sister
,
"
say
he
very
gravely
,
"
if
you
can
not
spare
Mrs.
Betty
to
-
day
,
any
other
time
will
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
yes
,
they
say
,
they
could
spare
her
well
enough
,
and
the
sister
beg
pardon
for
asking
,
which
they
do
but
of
mere
course
,
without
any
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
,
brother
,
"
say
the
eld
sister
,
"
you
must
tell
Mrs.
Betty
what
it
be
;
if
it
be
any
private
business
that
we
must
not
hear
,
you
may
call
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
there
she
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
sister
,
"
say
the
gentleman
very
gravely
,
"
what
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
only
desire
her
to
go
into
the
High
Street
"
<EOS>
(
and
then
he
pull
out
a
turnover
)
,
"
to
such
a
shop
"
;
and
then
he
tell
them
a
long
story
of
two
fine
neckcloth
he
have
bid
money
for
,
and
he
want
to
have
me
go
and
make
an
errand
to
buy
a
neck
to
the
turnover
that
he
show
,
to
see
if
they
would
take
my
money
for
the
neckcloth
;
to
bid
a
shill
more
,
and
haggle
with
them
;
and
then
he
make
more
errand
,
and
so
continue
to
have
such
petty
business
to
do
,
that
I
should
be
sure
to
stay
a
good
while
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
give
me
my
errand
,
he
tell
them
a
long
story
of
a
visit
he
be
go
to
make
to
a
family
they
all
know
,
and
where
be
to
be
such
-
and
-
such
gentleman
,
and
how
merry
they
be
to
be
,
and
very
formally
ask
his
sister
to
go
with
him
,
and
they
as
formally
excuse
themselves
,
because
of
company
that
they
have
notice
be
to
come
and
visit
them
that
afternoon
;
which
,
by
the
way
,
he
have
contrive
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
do
speak
to
them
,
and
give
me
my
errand
,
but
his
man
come
up
to
tell
him
that
Sir
W

#
#
#
H####"s
coach
stop
at
the
door
;
so
he
run
down
,
and
come
up
again
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
aloud
,
"
there
be
all
my
mirth
spoil
at
once
;
sir
W
#
#
#
#
have
send
his
coach
for
me
,
and
desire
to
speak
with
me
upon
some
earnest
business
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
this
Sir
W
#
#
#
#
be
a
gentleman
who
live
about
three
mile
out
of
town
,
to
whom
he
have
speak
on
purpose
the
day
before
,
to
lend
him
his
chariot
for
a
particular
occasion
,
and
have
appoint
it
to
call
for
him
,
as
it
do
,
about
three
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
he
call
for
his
good
wig
,
hat
,
and
sword
,
and
order
his
man
to
go
to
the
other
place
to
make
his
excuse
 
that
be
to
say
,
he
make
an
excuse
to
send
his
man
away
 
<EOS>
he
prepare
to
go
into
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
go
,
he
stop
a
while
,
and
speak
mighty
earnestly
to
me
about
his
business
,
and
find
an
opportunity
to
say
very
softly
to
me
,
"
come
away
,
my
dear
,
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
,
but
make
a
curtsy
,
as
if
I
have
do
so
to
what
he
say
in
public
.
 
<EOS>
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
go
out
too
;
I
have
no
dress
other
than
before
,
except
that
I
have
a
hood
,
a
mask
,
a
fan
,
and
a
pair
of
glove
in
my
pocket
;
so
that
there
be
not
the
least
suspicion
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
wait
for
me
in
the
coach
in
a
back
-
lane
,
which
he
know
I
must
pass
by
,
and
have
direct
the
coachman
whither
to
go
,
which
be
to
a
certain
place
,
call
Mile
End
,
where
live
a
confidant
of
his
,
where
we
go
in
,
and
where
be
all
the
convenience
in
the
world
to
be
as
wicked
as
we
please
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
together
he
begin
to
talk
very
gravely
to
me
,
and
to
tell
me
he
do
not
bring
me
there
to
betray
me
;
that
his
passion
for
me
would
not
suffer
him
to
abuse
me
;
that
he
resolve
to
marry
me
as
soon
as
he
come
to
his
estate
;
that
in
the
meantime
,
if
I
would
grant
his
request
,
he
would
maintain
me
very
honourably
;
and
make
me
a
thousand
protestation
of
his
sincerity
and
of
his
affection
to
me
;
and
that
he
would
never
abandon
me
,
and
as
I
may
say
,
make
a
thousand
more
preamble
than
he
need
to
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
he
press
me
to
speak
,
I
tell
him
I
have
no
reason
to
question
the
sincerity
of
his
love
to
me
after
so
many
protestation
,
but
 
and
there
I
stop
,
as
if
I
leave
him
to
guess
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
,
my
dear
?
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
guess
what
you
mean
:
 
<EOS>
what
if
you
should
be
with
child
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
that
it
?
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
take
care
of
you
and
provide
for
you
,
and
the
child
too
;
and
that
you
may
see
I
be
not
in
jest
,
"
say
he
,
"
here
be
an
earnest
for
you
,
"
and
with
that
he
pull
out
a
silk
purse
,
with
an
hundred
guinea
in
it
,
and
give
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
give
you
such
another
,
"
say
he
,
"
every
year
till
I
marry
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
colour
come
and
go
,
at
the
sight
of
the
purse
and
with
the
fire
of
his
proposal
together
,
so
that
I
could
not
say
a
word
,
and
he
easily
perceive
it
;
so
put
the
purse
into
my
bosom
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
more
resistance
to
him
,
but
let
him
do
just
what
he
please
,
and
as
often
as
he
please
;
and
thus
I
finish
my
own
destruction
at
once
,
for
from
this
day
,
be
forsake
of
my
virtue
and
my
modesty
,
I
have
nothing
of
value
leave
to
recommend
me
,
either
to
God
's
blessing
or
man
's
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
but
thing
do
not
end
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
the
town
,
do
the
business
he
publicly
direct
me
to
,
and
be
at
home
before
anybody
think
me
long
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
my
gentleman
,
he
stay
out
,
as
he
tell
me
he
would
,
till
late
at
night
,
and
there
be
not
the
least
suspicion
in
the
family
either
on
his
account
or
on
mine
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
,
after
this
,
frequent
opportunity
to
repeat
our
crime
  
c
hiefly
by
his
contrivance
 
especially
at
home
,
when
his
mother
and
the
young
lady
go
abroad
a
-
visiting
,
which
he
watch
so
narrowly
as
never
to
miss
;
know
always
beforehand
when
they
go
out
,
and
then
fail
not
to
catch
me
all
alone
,
and
securely
enough
;
so
that
we
take
our
fill
of
our
wicked
pleasure
for
near
half
a
year
;
and
yet
,
which
be
the
most
to
my
satisfaction
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
with
child
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
this
half
-
year
be
expire
,
his
young
brother
,
of
whom
I
have
make
some
mention
in
the
beginning
of
the
story
,
fall
to
work
with
me
;
and
<EOS>
he
,
find
me
alone
in
the
garden
one
evening
,
begin
a
story
of
the
same
kind
to
me
,
make
good
honest
profession
of
be
in
love
with
me
,
and
in
short
,
propose
fairly
and
honourably
to
marry
me
,
and
that
before
he
make
any
other
offer
to
me
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
confound
,
and
drive
to
such
an
extremity
as
the
like
be
never
know
;
at
least
not
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
resist
the
proposal
with
obstinacy
;
and
now
I
begin
to
arm
myself
with
argument
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
before
him
the
inequality
of
the
match
;
the
treatment
I
should
meet
with
in
the
family
;
the
ingratitude
it
would
be
to
his
good
father
and
mother
,
who
have
take
me
into
their
house
upon
such
generous
principle
,
and
when
I
be
in
such
a
low
condition
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
say
everything
to
dissuade
him
from
his
design
that
I
could
imagine
,
except
tell
him
the
truth
,
which
would
indeed
have
put
an
end
to
it
all
,
but
that
I
durst
not
think
of
mention
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
happen
a
circumstance
that
I
do
not
expect
indeed
,
which
put
me
to
my
shift
;
for
this
young
gentleman
,
as
he
be
plain
and
honest
,
so
he
pretend
to
nothing
with
me
but
what
be
so
too
;
and
,
know
his
own
innocence
,
he
be
not
so
careful
to
make
his
have
a
kindness
for
Mrs.
Betty
<EOS>
a
secret
<EOS>
I
the
house
,
as
his
brother
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
he
do
not
let
them
know
that
he
have
talk
to
me
about
it
<EOS>
,
yet
he
say
enough
to
let
his
sister
perceive
he
love
me
,
and
his
mother
see
it
too
,
which
,
though
they
take
no
notice
of
it
to
me
,
yet
they
do
to
him
,
an
immediately
I
find
their
carriage
to
me
alter
,
more
than
ever
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
the
cloud
,
though
I
do
not
foresee
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
easy
,
I
say
,
to
see
that
their
carriage
to
me
be
alter
,
and
that
it
grow
bad
and
bad
every
day
;
till
at
last
I
get
information
among
the
servant
that
I
should
,
in
a
very
little
while
,
be
desire
to
remove
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
alarm
at
the
news
,
have
a
full
satisfaction
that
I
should
be
otherwise
provide
for
;
and
especially
consider
that
I
have
reason
every
day
to
expect
I
should
be
with
child
,
and
that
then
I
should
be
oblige
to
remove
without
any
pretence
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
time
the
young
gentleman
take
an
opportunity
to
tell
me
that
the
kindness
he
have
for
me
have
get
vent
in
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
charge
me
with
it
,
he
say
,
<EOS>
for
he
know
well
enough
which
way
it
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
his
plain
way
of
 
talking
<EOS>
have
be
the
occasion
of
it
,
for
that
he
do
not
make
his
respect
for
me
so
much
a
secret
as
he
may
have
do
,
and
the
reason
be
,
that
he
be
at
a
point
,
that
if
I
would
consent
to
have
him
,
he
would
tell
them
all
openly
that
he
love
me
,
and
that
he
intend
to
marry
me
;
that
it
be
true
his
father
and
mother
may
resent
it
,
and
be
unkind
,
but
that
he
be
now
in
a
way
to
live
,
be
breed
to
the
law
,
and
he
do
not
fear
maintain
me
agreeable
to
what
I
should
expect
;
and
that
,
in
short
,
as
he
believe
I
would
not
be
ashamed
of
him
,
so
he
be
resolve
not
to
be
ashamed
of
me
,
and
that
he
scorn
to
be
afraid
to
own
me
now
,
<EOS>
whom
he
resolve
to
own
after
I
be
his
wife
,
and
therefore
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
him
my
hand
,
and
he
would
answer
for
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
a
dreadful
condition
indeed
,
and
now
I
repent
heartily
my
easiness
with
the
eld
brother
;
not
from
any
reflection
of
conscience
,
but
from
a
view
of
the
happiness
I
may
have
enjoy
,
and
have
now
make
impossible
;
for
though
I
have
no
great
scruple
of
conscience
,
as
I
have
say
,
to
struggle
with
,
yet
I
could
not
think
of
be
a
whore
to
one
brother
and
a
wife
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
it
come
into
my
thought
that
the
first
brother
have
promise
to
made
me
his
wife
when
he
come
to
his
estate
;
but
I
presently
remember
what
I
have
often
think
of
,
that
he
have
never
speak
a
word
of
have
me
for
a
wife
after
he
have
conquer
me
for
a
mistress
;
and
indeed
,
till
now
,
though
I
say
I
think
of
it
often
,
yet
it
give
me
no
disturbance
at
all
,
for
as
he
do
not
seem
in
the
least
to
lessen
his
affection
to
me
,
so
neither
do
he
lessen
his
bounty
,
though
he
have
the
discretion
himself
to
desire
me
not
to
lay
out
a
penny
of
what
he
give
me
in
clothe
,
or
to
make
the
least
show
extraordinary
,
because
it
would
necessarily
give
jealousy
in
the
family
,
since
everybody
know
I
could
come
at
such
thing
no
manner
of
ordinary
way
,
but
by
some
private
friendship
,
which
they
would
presently
have
suspect
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
now
in
a
great
strait
,
and
know
not
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
main
difficulty
be
this
:
 
the
young
brother
not
only
lay
close
siege
to
me
,
but
suffer
it
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
come
into
his
sister
's
room
,
and
his
mother
's
room
,
and
sit
down
,
and
talk
a
thousand
kind
thing
of
me
,
and
to
me
,
even
before
their
face
,
and
when
they
be
all
there
.
<EOS>
this
grow
so
public
that
the
whole
house
talk
of
it
,
and
his
mother
reprove
him
for
it
,
and
their
carriage
to
me
appear
quite
alter
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
his
mother
have
let
fall
some
speech
,
as
if
she
intend
to
put
me
out
of
the
family
;
that
is
,
in
English
,
to
turn
me
out
of
door
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
be
sure
this
could
not
be
a
secret
to
his
brother
,
only
that
he
may
not
think
,
as
indeed
nobody
else
yet
do
,
that
the
young
brother
have
make
any
proposal
to
me
about
it
;
but
as
I
easily
could
see
that
it
would
go
farther
,
so
<EOS>
I
see
likewise
there
be
an
absolute
necessity
to
speak
of
it
to
him
,
or
that
he
would
speak
of
it
to
me
,
and
which
to
do
first
I
know
not
;
that
is
,
whether
I
should
break
it
to
him
or
let
it
alone
till
he
should
break
it
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
upon
serious
consideration
,
for
indeed
now
I
begin
to
consider
thing
very
seriously
,
and
never
till
now
;
I
say
,
upon
serious
consideration
,
I
resolve
to
tell
him
of
it
first
;
and
it
be
not
long
before
I
have
an
opportunity
,
for
the
very
next
day
his
brother
go
to
London
upon
some
business
,
and
the
family
be
out
a
-
visit
,
just
as
it
have
happen
before
,
and
as
indeed
be
often
the
case
,
he
come
accord
to
his
custom
,
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
Mrs.
Betty
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
have
have
sit
down
a
while
,
he
easily
perceive
there
be
an
alteration
in
my
countenance
,
<EOS>
that
I
be
not
so
free
and
pleasant
with
him
as
I
use
to
be
,
and
particularly
,
that
I
have
be
a
-
crying
;
he
be
not
long
before
he
take
notice
of
it
,
and
ask
me
in
very
kind
term
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
,
and
if
 
anything
trouble
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
put
it
off
if
I
could
,
but
it
be
not
to
be
conceal
;
so
after
suffer
many
importunity
to
draw
that
out
of
me
which
I
long
as
much
as
possible
to
disclose
,
I
tell
him
that
it
be
true
something
do
trouble
me
,
and
something
of
such
a
nature
that
I
could
not
conceal
from
him
,
and
yet
that
I
could
not
tell
how
to
tell
him
of
it
neither
;
that
it
be
a
thing
that
not
only
surprise
me
,
but
greatly
perplex
me
,
and
that
I
know
not
what
course
to
take
,
unless
he
would
direct
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
with
great
tenderness
,
that
let
it
be
what
it
would
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
let
it
trouble
me
,
for
he
would
protect
me
from
all
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
begin
at
a
distance
,
and
tell
him
I
be
afraid
the
lady
have
get
some
secret
information
of
our
correspondence
;
for
that
it
be
easy
to
see
that
their
conduct
be
very
much
change
towards
me
for
a
great
while
,
and
that
now
it
be
come
to
that
pass
that
they
frequently
find
fault
with
me
,
and
sometimes
fall
quite
out
with
me
,
though
I
never
give
them
the
least
occasion
;
that
whereas
I
use
always
to
lie
with
the
eld
sister
,
I
be
lately
put
to
lie
by
myself
,
or
with
one
of
the
maid
;
and
that
I
have
overhear
them
several
time
talk
very
unkindly
about
me
;
but
that
which
confirm
it
all
be
,
that
one
of
the
servant
have
tell
me
that
she
have
hear
I
 
be
to
be
turn
out
,
and
that
it
be
not
safe
for
the
family
that
I
should
be
any
longer
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
smile
when
he
herd
all
this
,
and
I
ask
him
how
he
could
make
so
light
of
it
,
when
he
must
needs
know
that
if
there
be
any
discovery
I
be
undo
for
ever
,
and
that
even
it
would
hurt
him
,
though
not
ruin
him
as
it
would
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
upbraid
him
,
that
he
be
like
all
the
rest
of
the
sex
,
<EOS>
that
,
when
they
have
the
character
and
honour
of
a
woman
at
their
mercy
,
oftentime
make
it
their
jest
,
and
at
least
look
upon
it
as
a
trifle
,
and
count
the
ruin
of
those
they
have
have
their
will
of
as
a
thing
of
no
value
.
  
<EOS>
He
see
me
warm
and
serious
,
and
he
change
his
style
immediately
;
he
tell
me
he
be
sorry
<EOS>
I
should
have
such
a
thought
of
him
;
that
he
have
never
give
me
the
least
occasion
for
it
,
but
have
be
as
tender
of
my
reputation
as
he
could
be
of
his
own
;
that
he
be
sure
our
correspondence
have
be
manage
with
so
much
address
,
that
not
one
creature
in
the
family
have
so
much
as
a
suspicion
of
it
;
that
if
he
smile
when
I
tell
him
my
thought
,
it
be
at
the
assurance
he
lately
receive
,
that
our
understanding
one
another
be
not
so
much
as
know
or
guess
at
;
and
that
when
he
have
tell
me
how
much
reason
he
have
to
be
easy
,
I
should
smile
as
he
do
,
for
he
be
very
certain
it
would
give
me
a
full
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
mystery
I
can
not
understand
,
"
say
I
,
"
or
how
it
should
be
to
my
satisfaction
that
I
be
to
be
turn
out
of
door
;
for
if
our
correspondence
be
not
discover
,
I
know
not
what
else
I
have
do
to
change
the
countenance
of
the
whole
family
to
me
,
or
to
have
them
treat
me
as
they
do
now
,
who
formerly
use
me
with
so
much
tenderness
,
as
if
I
have
be
one
of
their
own
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
look
you
,
child
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
they
be
uneasy
about
you
,
that
be
true
;
but
that
they
have
the
least
suspicion
of
the
case
as
it
be
,
and
as
it
respect
you
and
I
,
be
so
far
from
be
true
,
that
they
suspect
my
brother
Robin
;
and
,
in
short
,
they
be
fully
persuade
he
make
love
to
you
;
<EOS>
nay
,
the
fool
have
put
it
into
their
head
too
himself
,
for
he
be
continually
banter
them
about
it
,
and
make
a
jest
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
wrong
to
do
so
,
because
he
can
not
but
see
it
vex
them
,
and
make
them
unkind
to
you
;
but
'
tis
a
satisfaction
to
me
,
because
of
the
assurance
it
give
me
,
that
they
do
not
suspect
me
in
the
least
,
and
I
hope
this
will
be
to
your
satisfaction
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
it
be
,
"
say
I
,
"
one
way
;
but
this
do
not
reach
my
case
at
all
,
nor
be
this
the
chief
thing
that
trouble
me
,
though
I
have
be
concern
about
that
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
,
then
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
with
which
I
fall
to
tear
,
and
could
say
nothing
to
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
strove
to
pacify
me
all
he
could
,
but
begin
at
last
to
be
very
pressing
upon
me
to
tell
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
answer
that
I
think
I
ought
to
tell
him
too
,
and
that
he
have
some
right
to
know
it
;
<EOS>
besides
,
that
I
want
his
direction
in
the
case
,
for
I
be
in
such
perplexity
that
I
know
not
what
course
to
take
,
and
then
I
relate
the
whole
affair
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
how
imprudently
his
brother
have
manage
himself
,
in
make
himself
so
public
;
for
that
if
he
have
keep
it
a
secret
,
as
such
a
thing
out
to
have
be
,
I
could
but
have
deny
him
positively
,
without
give
any
reason
for
it
,
and
he
would
in
time
have
cease
his
solicitation
;
but
that
he
have
the
vanity
,
first
,
to
depend
upon
it
that
I
would
not
deny
him
,
and
then
have
take
the
freedom
to
tell
his
resolution
of
have
me
to
the
whole
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
how
far
I
have
resist
him
,
and
tell
him
how
sincere
and
honourable
his
offer
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
I
,
"
my
case
will
be
doubly
hard
;
for
as
they
carry
it
ill
to
me
now
,
because
he
desire
to
have
me
,
they
will
carry
it
bad
when
they
shall
find
I
have
deny
him
;
and
they
will
presently
say
,
there
be
something
else
in
it
,
and
then
out
it
come
that
I
be
married
already
to
somebody
else
,
or
that
I
would
never
refuse
a
match
so
much
above
me
as
this
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
discourse
surprise
him
indeed
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
it
be
a
critical
point
indeed
for
me
to
manage
,
and
he
do
not
see
which
way
I
should
get
out
of
it
;
but
he
would
consider
it
,
and
let
me
know
next
time
we
meet
,
what
resolution
he
be
come
to
about
it
;
and
in
the
meantime
desire
I
would
not
give
my
consent
to
his
brother
,
nor
yet
give
him
a
flat
denial
,
but
that
I
would
hold
him
in
suspense
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
I
seem
to
start
at
his
saying
I
should
not
give
him
my
consent
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
know
<EOS>
very
well
I
have
no
consent
to
give
;
that
he
have
engage
himself
to
marry
me
,
and
that
my
consent
be
the
same
time
engage
to
him
;
that
he
have
all
along
tell
me
I
be
his
wife
,
and
I
look
upon
myself
as
effectually
<EOS>
so
as
if
the
ceremony
have
pass
;
and
that
it
be
from
his
own
mouth
that
I
do
so
,
he
have
all
along
persuade
me
to
call
myself
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
be
concern
at
that
now
;
if
I
be
not
your
husband
,
I
will
be
as
good
as
a
husband
to
you
;
and
do
not
let
those
thing
trouble
you
now
,
but
let
me
look
a
little
farther
into
this
affair
,
and
I
shall
be
able
to
say
more
next
time
we
meet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pacify
me
as
well
as
he
could
with
this
,
but
I
find
he
be
very
thoughtful
,
and
that
though
he
be
very
kind
to
me
and
 
kiss
me
a
thousand
time
,
and
more
I
believe
,
and
give
me
money
too
,
yet
he
offer
no
more
all
the
while
we
be
together
,
which
be
above
two
hour
,
and
which
I
much
wonder
at
indeed
at
that
time
,
consider
how
it
use
to
be
,
and
what
opportunity
we
have
.
  
<EOS>
His
brother
do
not
come
from
London
for
five
or
six
day
,
and
it
be
two
day
more
before
he
get
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
him
;
but
then
get
him
by
himself
he
begin
to
talk
very
close
to
him
about
it
,
and
the
same
evening
get
an
opportunity
<EOS>
(
for
we
have
a
long
conference
together
)
to
repeat
all
their
discourse
to
me
,
which
,
as
near
as
I
can
remember
,
be
to
the
purpose
follow
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
him
he
hear
strange
news
of
him
since
he
go
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
he
make
love
to
Mrs.
Betty
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
say
his
brother
a
little
angrily
,
"
and
so
I
do
.
<EOS>
and
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
what
have
anybody
to
do
with
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
his
brother
,
"
do
not
be
angry
,
Robin
;
I
do
not
pretend
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
;
nor
do
I
pretend
to
be
angry
with
you
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
find
they
do
concern
themselves
about
it
,
and
that
they
have
use
the
poor
girl
ill
about
it
,
which
I
should
take
as
do
to
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
whom
do
you
mean
by
they
?
"
say
Robin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
my
mother
and
the
girl
,
"
say
the
eld
brother
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
hark
ye
,
"
say
his
brother
,
"
be
you
in
earnest
?
<EOS>
do
you
really
love
this
girl
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
free
with
me
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
Robin
,
"
I
will
be
free
with
you
;
I
do
love
her
above
all
the
woman
in
the
world
,
and
I
will
have
her
,
let
them
say
and
do
what
they
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
the
girl
will
not
deny
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
strike
me
to
the
heart
when
he
tell
me
this
,
for
though
it
be
most
rational
to
think
I
would
not
deny
him
,
yet
I
know
in
my
own
conscience
I
must
deny
him
,
and
I
see
my
ruin
in
my
be
oblige
to
do
so
;
but
I
know
it
be
my
business
to
talk
otherwise
then
,
so
I
interrupt
him
in
his
story
thus
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
he
think
I
can
not
deny
him
?
 
<EOS>
but
he
shall
find
I
can
deny
him
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
let
me
give
you
the
whole
story
as
it
go
on
between
us
,
and
then
say
what
you
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
go
on
and
tell
me
that
he
reply
thus
:
 
"
<EOS>
but
,
brother
,
you
know
she
have
nothing
,
and
you
may
have
several
lady
with
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
'
Tis
no
matter
for
that
,
"
say
Robin
;
"
I
love
the
girl
,
and
I
will
never
please
my
pocket
in
marrying
,
and
not
please
my
fancy
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
my
dear
,
"
add
he
,
"
there
be
no
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
shall
see
I
can
oppose
him
;
I
have
learn
to
say
no
,
now
though
I
have
not
learn
it
before
;
if
the
good
lord
in
the
land
offer
me
marriage
now
,
I
could
very
cheerfully
say
no
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
can
you
say
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
as
you
say
when
we
talk
of
it
before
,
he
well
ask
you
many
question
about
it
,
and
all
the
house
will
wonder
what
the
meaning
of
it
should
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
smile
,
"
I
can
stop
all
their
mouth
at
one
clap
by
tell
him
,
and
them
too
,
that
I
be
married
already
to
his
eld
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
smile
a
little
too
at
the
word
,
but
I
could
see
it
startle
him
,
and
he
could
not
hide
the
disorder
it
put
him
into
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
return
,
"
<EOS>
why
,
though
that
may
be
true
in
some
sense
,
yet
I
suppose
you
be
but
in
jest
when
you
talk
of
give
such
an
answer
as
that
;
it
may
not
be
convenient
on
many
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
I
pleasantly
,
"
I
be
not
so
fond
of
let
the
secret
come
out
without
your
consent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
,
then
,
can
you
say
to
him
,
or
to
them
,
"
say
he
,
"
when
they
find
you
positive
against
a
match
which
would
be
apparently
so
much
to
your
advantage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
should
I
be
at
a
loss
?
 
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
I
be
not
oblige
to
give
me
any
reason
at
all
;
on
the
other
hand
,
I
may
tell
them
I
be
married
already
,
and
stop
there
,
and
that
will
be
a
full
stop
too
to
him
,
for
he
can
have
no
reason
to
ask
one
question
after
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
the
whole
house
will
tease
you
about
that
,
even
to
father
and
mother
,
and
if
you
deny
them
positively
,
they
will
be
disoblige
at
you
,
and
suspicious
besides
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
what
would
have
me
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
straight
enough
before
,
and
as
I
tell
you
,
I
be
in
perplexity
before
,
and
acquaint
you
with
the
circumstance
,
that
I
may
have
your
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
be
consider
very
much
upon
it
,
you
may
be
sure
,
and
though
it
be
a
piece
of
advice
that
have
a
great
many
mortification
in
it
to
me
,
and
may
at
first
seem
strange
to
you
,
yet
,
all
thing
consider
,
I
see
no
well
way
for
you
than
to
let
him
go
on
;
and
if
you
find
him
hearty
and
in
earnest
,
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
look
full
of
horror
at
those
word
,
and
,
turn
pale
as
death
,
be
at
the
very
point
of
sink
down
out
of
the
chair
I
sit
in
;
<EOS>
when
,
give
a
start
,
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
aloud
,
"
what
be
the
matter
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
you
a
-
go
?
"
and
a
great
many
such
thing
;
and
with
jogging
and
call
to
me
,
fetch
me
a
little
to
myself
,
though
it
be
a
good
while
before
I
fully
recover
my
sense
,
and
be
not
able
to
speak
for
several
minute
more
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
fully
recover
he
begin
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
make
you
so
surprised
at
what
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
consider
seriously
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
see
plainly
how
the
family
stand
in
this
case
,
and
they
would
be
stark
mad
if
it
be
my
case
,
as
it
be
my
brother
's
;
and
for
aught
I
see
,
it
would
be
my
ruin
and
yours
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
"
say
I
,
still
speak
angrily
;
"
be
all
your
protestation
and
vow
to
be
shake
by
the
dislike
of
the
family
?
 
<EOS>
do
I
not
always
object
that
to
you
,
and
you
make
light
thing
of
it
,
as
what
you
be
above
,
and
would
value
;
and
be
it
come
to
this
now
?
<EOS>
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
be
this
your
faith
and
honour
,
your
love
,
and
the
solidity
of
your
promise
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
continue
perfectly
calm
,
notwithstanding
all
my
reproach
,
and
I
be
not
spare
of
them
at
all
;
but
he
reply
at
last
,
"
My
dear
,
I
have
not
break
one
promise
with
you
yet
;
I
do
tell
you
I
would
marry
you
when
I
be
come
to
my
estate
;
but
you
see
my
father
be
a
hale
,
healthy
man
,
and
may
live
these
thirty
year
still
,
and
not
be
old
than
several
be
round
us
in
town
;
and
you
never
propose
my
marrying
you
sooner
,
because
you
know
it
may
be
my
ruin
;
and
as
to
all
the
rest
,
I
have
not
fail
you
in
anything
,
you
have
want
for
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
deny
a
word
of
this
,
and
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
in
general
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
can
you
persuade
me
to
such
a
horrid
step
as
leave
you
,
since
you

not
leave
me

<EOS>
Will
you
allow
no
affection

no
love
on
my
side

where
there
have
be
so
much
on
your
side

have
I
make
you
no
return

have
I
give
no
testimony
of
my
sincerity

of
my
passion
?

be
the
sacrifice
I
have
make
of
honour
and
modesty
to
you
no
proof
of
my

to
you

bond
too
strong
to

here
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
may
come
into
a
safe
station
,
and
appear
with
honour
and
with
splendour
at
once
,
and
the
remembrance
of
what
we
have
do
may
be
wrapt
up
in
an
eternal
silence
,
as
if
it
have
never
happen
;
you
shall
always
have
my
respect
,
and
my
sincere
affection
,
only
then
it
shall
be
honest
,
and
perfectly
just
to
my
brother
;
you
shall
be
my
dear
sister
,
as
now
you
be
my
dear
"
and
there
he
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
dear
whore
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
would
have
say
if
you
have
go
on
,
and
you
may
as
well
have
say
it
;
but
I
understand
you
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
desire
you
to
remember
the
long
discourse
you
have
have
with
me
,
and
the
many
hour
"
pain
<EOS>
you
have
take
to
persuade
me
to
believe
myself
an
honest
woman
;
that
I
be
your
wife
intentionally
,
though
not
in
the
eye
of
the
world
,
and
that
it
be
as
effectual
a
marriage
that
have
pass
between
us
as
be
we
have
be
publicly
wed
by
the
parson
of
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
and
can
not
but
remember
that
these
have
be
your
own
word
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
find
this
be
a
little
too
close
upon
him
,
but
I
make
it
up
in
what
follow
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
stock
-
still
for
a
while
and
say
nothing
,
and
I
go
on
thus
:
 
"
You
can
not
,
"
say
I
,
"
without
the
high
injustice
,
believe
that
I
yield
upon
all
these
persuasion
without
a
love
not
to
be
question
,
not
to
be
shake
again
by
anything
that
could
happen
afterward
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
such
dishonourable
thought
of
me
,
I
must
ask
you
what
foundation
in
any
of
my
behaviour
<EOS>
have
I
give
for
such
a
suggestion
?
  
<EOS>
"
if
,
then
,
I
have
yield
to
the
importunity
of
my
affection
,
and
if
I
have
be
persuade
to
believe
that
I
be
really
,
and
in
the
essence
of
the
thing
,
your
wife
,
shall
I
now
give
the
lie
to
all
those
argument
and
call
myself
your
whore
,
or
mistress
,
which
be
the
same
thing
?
 
<EOS>
and
will
you
transfer
me
to
your
brother
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
transfer
my
affection
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
bid
me
cease
love
you
,
and
bid
me
love
him
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
my
power
,
think
you
,
to
make
such
a
change
at
demand
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
depend
upon
it
'
<EOS>
tis
impossible
,
and
whatever
the
change
of
your
side
may
be
<EOS>
,
I
will
ever
be
true
;
and
I
have
much
rather
,
since
it
be
come
<EOS>
that
unhappy
length
,
be
your
whore
than
your
brother
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
appear
pleased
and
touch
with
the
impression
of
this
last
discourse
,
and
tell
me
that
he
stand
where
he
do
before
;
that
he
have
not
be
unfaithful
to
me
in
any
one
promise
he
have
ever
make
yet
,
but
that
there
be
so
many
terrible
thing
present
themselves
to
his
view
in
the
affair
before
me
,
and
that
on
my
account
in
particular
,
that
he
have
think
of
the
other
as
a
remedy
so
effectual
as
nothing
could
come
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
that
he
think
this
would
not
be
entire
part
us
,
but
we
may
love
as
friend
all
our
day
,
and
perhaps
with
more
satisfaction
than
we
should
in
the
station
<EOS>
we
be
now
in
,
as
thing
may
happen
;
that
he
durst
say
,
I
could
not
apprehend
anything
from
him
as
to
betray
a
secret
,
which
could
not
but
be
the
destruction
of
us
both
,
if
it
come
out
;
that
he
have
but
one
question
to
ask
of
me
that
could
lie
in
the
way
of
it
,
and
if
that
question
be
answer
in
the
negative
,
he
could
not
but
think
still
it
be
the
only
step
I
could
take
.
  
<EOS>
I
guess
at
his
question
presently
,
namely
,
whether
I
be
sure
I
be
not
with
child
?
 
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
I
tell
him
he
nee
not
be
concern
about
it
,
for
I
be
not
with
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
have
no
time
to
talk
further
now
.
<EOS>
consider
of
it
,
and
think
closely
about
it
;
I
can
not
but
be
of
the
opinion
still
,
that
it
will
be
the
good
course
you
can
take
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
this
he
take
his
leave
,
and
the
more
hastily
too
,
his
mother
and
sister
ring
at
the
gate
,
just
at
the
moment
that
he
have
rise
up
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
He
leave
me
in
the
utmost
confusion
of
 
thought
;
and
he
easily
perceive
it
the
next
day
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
week
,
for
it
be
but
<EOS>
Tuesday
evening
when
we
talk
;
but
he
have
no
opportunity
to
come
at
me
all
that
week
,
till
the
Sunday
after
,
when
I
,
be
indispose
,
do
not
go
to
church
,
and
he
,
make
some
excuse
for
the
like
,
stay
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
he
have
me
an
hour
and
a
half
again
by
myself
,
and
we
fall
into
the
same
argument
all
over
again
,
or
at
least
so
near
the
same
,
as
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
to
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
ask
him
warmly
,
what
opinion
he
must
have
of
my
modesty
,
that
he
could
suppose
I
should
so
much
as
entertain
a
thought
of
lie
with
two
brother
,
and
assure
him
it
could
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
add
,
if
he
be
to
tell
me
that
he
would
never
see
me
more
,
than
which
nothing
but
death
could
be
more
terrible
,
<EOS>
yet
I
could
never
entertain
a
thought
so
dishonourable
to
myself
,
and
so
base
to
him
;
and
therefore
,
I
entreat
him
,
if
he
have
one
grain
of
respect
or
affection
leave
for
me
,
that
he
would
speak
no
more
of
it
to
me
,
or
that
he
would
pull
his
sword
out
and
kill
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
surprised
at
my
obstinacy
,
as
he
call
it
;
tell
me
I
be
unkind
to
myself
,
and
unkind
to
him
in
it
;
that
it
be
a
crisis
unlooke
for
upon
us
both
,
and
impossible
for
either
of
us
to
foresee
,
but
that
he
do
not
see
any
other
way
to
save
us
both
from
ruin
,
and
therefore
he
think
it
the
more
unkind
;
but
that
if
he
must
say
no
more
of
it
to
me
,
he
add
with
an
unusual
coldness
,
that
he
do
not
know
anything
else
we
have
to
talk
of
;
and
so
he
rise
up
to
take
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
rise
up
too
,
as
if
with
the
same
indifference
;
but
when
he
come
to
give
me
as
it
be
a
parting
kiss
,
I
burst
out
into
such
a
passion
of
crying
,
that
though
I
would
have
speak
,
I
could
not
,
and
only
press
his
hand
,
seem
to
give
him
the
adieu
,
but
cry
vehemently
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
sensibly
move
with
this
;
so
he
sit
down
again
,
and
say
a
great
many
kind
thing
to
me
,
to
abate
the
excess
of
my
passion
,
but
still
urge
the
necessity
of
what
he
have
propose
;
all
the
while
insist
,
that
if
I
do
refuse
,
he
would
notwithstanding
provide
for
me
;
but
let
me
plainly
see
that
he
would
decline
me
in
the
main
point
 
nay
,
even
as
a
mistress
;
make
it
a
point
of
honour
not
to
lie
with
the
woman
that
,
for
aught
he
know
,
may
come
to
be
his
brother
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
the
bare
loss
of
him
as
a
gallant
be
not
so
much
my
affliction
as
the
loss
of
his
person
,
whom
indeed
I
love
to
distraction
;
and
the
loss
of
all
the
expectation
I
have
,
and
which
I
always
have
build
my
hope
upon
,
of
have
him
one
day
for
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
these
thing
oppress
my
mind
so
much
,
that
,
in
short
,
I
fall
very
ill
;
the
agony
of
my
mind
,
in
a
word
,
throw
 
me
into
a
high
fever
,
and
long
it
be
,
that
none
in
the
family
expect
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
reduce
very
low
indeed
,
and
be
often
delirious
and
light
-
head
;
but
nothing
lie
so
near
me
as
the
fear
that
,
when
I
be
light
-
head
,
I
should
say
something
or
other
to
his
prejudice
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
distressed
in
my
mind
also
to
see
him
,
and
so
he
be
to
see
me
<EOS>
,
for
he
really
love
me
most
passionately
;
but
it
could
not
be
;
there
be
not
the
least
room
to
desire
it
on
one
side
or
other
,
or
so
much
as
to
make
it
decent
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
near
five
week
that
I
keep
my
bed
and
though
the
violence
of
my
fever
abate
in
three
week
,
yet
it
several
time
return
;
and
the
physician
say
two
or
three
time
,
they
could
do
no
more
for
me
,
but
that
they
must
leave
nature
and
the
distemper
to
fight
it
out
,
only
strengthen
the
first
with
cordial
to
maintain
the
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
end
of
five
week
I
grow
well
,
but
be
so
weak
,
so
altered
,
so
melancholy
,
and
recover
so
slowly
,
that
they
physician
apprehend
I
should
go
into
a
consumption
;
and
which
vex
me
most
,
they
give
it
as
their
opinion
that
my
mind
be
oppress
,
that
something
trouble
me
,
and
,
in
short
,
that
I
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
whole
house
be
set
upon
me
to
examine
me
,
and
to
press
me
to
tell
whether
I
be
in
love
or
not
,
and
with
whom
;
but
as
I
well
may
,
I
deny
my
being
in
love
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
on
this
occasion
a
squabble
one
day
about
me
at
table
,
that
have
like
to
have
put
the
whole
family
in
an
uproar
,
and
for
some
time
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
They
happen
to
be
all
at
table
but
the
father
;
as
for
me
,
I
be
ill
,
and
in
my
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
beginning
of
the
talk
,
which
be
just
as
they
have
finish
their
dinner
,
<EOS>
the
old
gentlewoman
,
who
have
send
me
somewhat
to
eat
,
call
her
maid
to
go
up
and
ask
me
if
I
would
have
any
more
;
but
the
maid
bring
down
word
I
have
not
eat
half
what
she
have
send
me
already
.
  
<EOS>
"
alas
,
say
the
old
lady
,
"
that
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
she
will
never
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
"
say
the
eld
brother
,
"
how
should
Mrs.
Betty
be
well
?
<EOS>
They
say
she
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
nothing
of
it
,
"
say
the
old
gentlewoman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
the
eld
sister
,
"
what
to
say
to
it
;
they
have
make
such
a
rout
about
her
be
so
handsome
,
and
so
charming
,
and
I
know
not
what
,
and
that
in
her
hearing
too
,
that
have
turn
the
creature
's
head
,
I
believe
,
and
who
know
what
possession
may
follow
such
doing
?
 
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
sister
,
you
must
acknowledge
she
be
very
handsome
,
"
say
the
eld
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
and
a
great
deal
handsomer
than
you
,
sister
,
"
say
Robin
,
"
and
that
be
your
mortification
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
that
be
not
the
question
,
"
say
his
sister
;
"
that
girl
be
well
enough
,
and
she
know
it
well
enough
;
she
nee
not
be
tell
of
it
to
make
her
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
talk
of
her
be
vain
,
"
say
the
eld
brother
,
"
but
of
her
be
in
love
;
it
may
be
she
be
in
love
with
herself
<EOS>
;
it
seem
my
sister
think
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
she
be
in
love
with
me
,
"
say
Robin
;
"
I
would
quickly
put
her
out
of
her
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
d'ye
mean
by
that
,
son
,
"
say
the
old
lady
;
"
how
can
you
talk
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
Robin
,
again
,
very
honestly
,
"
do
you
think
I
would
let
the
poor
girl
die
for
love
,
and
of
one
that
be
near

hand
to

too

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fie
,
brother
!
"
,
say
the
second
sister
,
"
how
can
you
talk
so
?
<EOS>
Would
you
take
a
creature
that
have
not
a
groat

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
prithee
,
child
,
"
say
Robin
,
"
beauty
's
a
portion
,
and
good

I
wish
thou

so
there

this
fire
the

she
fly
into
a

thing

come
to

that

she
hope
her

consider

<EOS>
Robin
reply
,
that
be
business
for
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
family
,
who
where
not
to
be
teach
by
one
that
have
so
little
judgment
as
his
eld
sister
.
  
<EOS>
It
run
up
a
great
deal
farther
;
the
sister
scold
,
Robin
rally
and
banter
,
but
poor
Betty
lose
ground
by
it
extremely
in
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
of
it
,
and
I
cry
heartily
,
and
the
old
lady
come
up
to
me
,
somebody
have
tell
her
that
I
be
so
much
concerned
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
complain
to
her
,
that
it
be
very
hard
the
doctor
should
pass
such
a
censure
upon
me
,
for
which
they
have
no
ground
;
and
that
it
be
still
harder
,
consider
the
circumstance
I
be
under
in
the
family
;
that
I
hope
I
have
do
nothing
to
lessen
her
esteem
for
me
,
or
give
any
occasion
for
the
bickering
between
her
son
and
daughter
,
and
I
have
more
need
to
think
of
a
coffin
than
of
be
in
love
,
and
beg
she
would
not
let
me
suffer
in
her
opinion
for
anybody
's
mistake
but
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
sensible
of
the
justice
of
what
I
say
,
but
tell
me
,
since
there
have
be
such
a
clamour
among
them
,
and
that
her
young
son
talk
after
such
a
rattling
way
as
he
do
,
she
desire
I
would
be
so
faithful
to
her
as
to
answer
her
but
one
question
sincerely
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
would
,
with
all
my
heart
,
and
with
the
utmost
plainness
and
sincerity
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
the
question
be
,
whether
there
way
anything
between
her
son
Robert
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
with
all
the
protestation
of
sincerity
that
I
be
able
to
make
,
and
as
I
may
well
,
do
,
that
there
be
not
,
nor
every
have
be
<EOS>
;
I
tell
her
that
Mr.
Robert
have
rattle
and
jest
,
as
she
know
it
be
his
way
,
and
that
I
take
it
always
,
as
I
suppose
he
mean
it
,
to
be
a
wild
airy
way
of
discourse
that
have
no
signification
in
it
;
and
again
assure
her
,
that
there
be
not
the
least
tittle
of
what
she
understand
by
it
between
us
;
and
that
those
who
have
suggest
it
have
do
me
a
great
deal
of
wrong
,
and
Mr.
Robert
<EOS>
no
service
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
fully
satisfied
,
and
kiss
me
,
speak
cheerfully
to
me
,
and
bid
me
take
care
of
my
health
and
want
for
nothing
,
and
so
take
her
leave
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
she
come
down
she
find
the
brother
and
all
his
sister
together
by
the
ear
;
they
be
angry
,
even
to
passion
,
at
his
upbraid
them
with
their
be
homely
,
and
have
never
have
any
sweetheart
,
never
have
be
ask
the
question
,
and
their
be
so
forward
as
almost
to
ask
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
rally
them
upon
the
subject
of
Mrs.
Betty
;
how
pretty
,
how
good
-
humoured
,
how
she
sing
better
then
they
do
,
and
dance
better
,
and
how
much
handsome
she
be
;
and
in
do
this
he
omit
no
ill
-
natured
thing
that
could
vex
them
,
and
indeed
,
push
too
hard
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
lady
come
down
in
the
height
of
it
,
and
to
put
a
stop
it
to
,
tell
them
all
the
discourse
she
have
have
with
me
,
and
how
I
answer
,
that
there
be
nothing
between
Mr.
Robert
and
I.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
wrong
there

say
Robin

"
for
if

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

for
you
ramble
so
in
your
discourse

that
nobody
know

as
I
find
the

by

have
answer
truly

I
wish

do
so

tis
in

I

<EOS>
if
Mrs.

she

I
would
have
her
tomorrow
morning

concerned

the

Mrs.

with
that

rise
up
and
brush
off

<EOS>
"
no
,
"

the
eld
sister
,
"
I
dare
answer
for
my

he
know
the
world
better

"
  
<EOS>
thus
the
discourse
end
,
but
it
leave
the
eld
brother
quite
confound
.
 
<EOS>
He
conclude
his
brother
have
make
a
full
discovery
,
and
he
begin
to
doubt
whether
I
have
be
concern
in
it
or
not
;
but
with
all
his
management
he
could
not
bring
it
about
to
get
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
be
so
perplexed
that
he
be
quite
desperate
,
and
resolve
he
would
come
into
my
chamber
and
see
me
,
whatever
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
do
this
,
he
contrive
it
so
,
that
one
day
after
dinner
,
watch
his
eld
sister
till
he
could
see
her
go
upstairs
,
he
run
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
ye
,
sister
,
"
say
he
,
"
where
be
this
sick
woman
?
 
<EOS>
May
not
a
body
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
sister
,
"
I
believe
you
may
;
but
let
me
go
first
a
little
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
she
run
up
to
the
door
and
give
me
notice
,
and
presently
call
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
brother
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
may
come
if
you
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
in
he
come
,
just
in
the
same
kind
of
rant
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
at
the
door
as
he
come
in
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
this
sick
body
that
be
in
love
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
ye
do
,
Mrs.
Betty
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
get
up
out
of
my
chair
,
but
be
so
weak
I
could
not
for
a
good
while
;
and
he
see
it
,
and
his
sister
to
,
and
she
say
,
"
come
,
do
not
strive
to
stand
up
;
my
brother
desire
no
ceremony
,
especially
now
you
be
so
weak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
Mrs.
Betty
,
pray
sit
still
,
"
say
he
,
and
so
sit
himself
down
in
a
chair
over
against
me
,
and
appear
as
if
he
be
mighty
merry
.
  
<EOS>
He
talk
a
lot
of
rambling
stuff
to
his
sister
and
to
me
,
sometimes
of
one
thing
,
sometimes
of
another
,
on
purpose
to
amuse
his
sister
,
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
would
turn
it
upon
the
old
story
,
direct
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mrs.
Betty
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
a
sad
thing
to
be
in
love
;
why
,
it
have
reduce
you
sadly
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
speak
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
so
merry
,
sir
,
"
say
I
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
think
the
doctor
may
have
find
something
well
to
do
than
to
make
his
game
at
his
patient
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
ill
of
no
other
distemper
,
I
know
the
proverb
too
well
to
have
let
him
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
proverb
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
remember
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
what
        
<EOS>
"
where
love
be
the
case
,
      
the
doctor
be
an
ass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
be
not
that
it
,
Mrs.
Betty
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
smile
and
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
think
the
effect
have
prove
it
to
be
love
<EOS>
,
for
it
seem
the
doctor
have
be
able
to
do
you
but
little
service
;
you
mend
very
slowly
,
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
there
be
somewhat
in
it
,
Mrs.
Betty
;
I
doubt
you
be
sick
of
the
incurable
,
and
that
be
love
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
smile
and
say
,
"
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
that
be
none
of
my
distemper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
deal
of
such
discourse
,
and
sometimes
other
that
signify
as
little
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
he
ask
me
to
sing
them
a
song
,
at
which
I
smile
,
and
say
my
singing
day
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
ask
me
if
he
should
play
upon
his
flute
to
me
;
his
sister
say
she
believe
it
would
hurt
me
,
and
that
my
head
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
bow
,
and
say
,
no
,
it
would
not
hurt
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
pray
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
do
not
hinder
it
;
I
love
the
music
of
the
flute
very
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
his
sister
say
,
"
well
,
do
,
then
,
brother
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
that
he
pull
out
the
key
of
his
closet
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
sister
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
very
lazy
;
do
step
to
my
closet
and
fetch
my
flute
;
it
lie
in
such
a
drawer
,
"
name
a
place
where
he
be
sure
it
be
not
,
that
she
may
be
a
little
while
a
-
look
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
be
go
,
he
relate
the
whole
story
to
me
of
the
discourse
his
brother
have
about
me
,
and
of
his
push
it
at
him
,
and
his
concern
about
it
,
which
be
the
reason
of
his
contrive
this
visit
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
<EOS>
I
have
never
open
my
mouth
either
to
his
brother
or
to
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
dreadful
exigence
I
be
in
;
that
my
love
to
him
,
and
his
offering
to
have
<EOS>
me
forget
that
affection
and
remove
it
to
another
,
have
throw
me
down
;
and
that
I
have
a
thousand
time
<EOS>
wish
I
may
die
rather
than
recover
,
and
to
have
the
same
circumstance
to
struggle
with
as
I
have
before
,
and
that
his
backwardness
to
life
have
be
the
great
reason
of
the
slowness
of
my
recovering
.
 
<EOS>
I
add
that
I
foresaw
that
as
soon
as
I
be
well
,
I
must
quit
the
family
,
and
that
as
for
marry
his
brother
,
I
abhor
the
thought
of
it
after
what
have
be
my
case
with
him
,
and
that
he
may
depend
upon
it
<EOS>
I
would
never
see
his
brother
again
upon
that
subject
;
that
if
he
would
break
all
his
vow
and
oath
and
engagement
with
me
,
be
that
between
his
conscience
and
his
honour
and
himself
;
but
he
should
never
be
able
to
say
that
I
,
whom
he
have
persuade
to
call
myself
his
wife
,
and
who
have
give
him
the
liberty
to
use
me
as
a
wife
,
be
not
as
faithful
to
him
as
a
wife
ought
to
be
,
whatever
he
may
be
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
reply
,
and
have
say
that
he
be
sorry
I
could
not
be
persuade
,
and
be
a
-
go
to
say
more
,
but
he
hear
his
sister
a
-
come
,
and
so
do
I
;
and
yet
I
force
out
these
few
word
as
a
reply
,
that
I
could
never
be
persuade
to
love
one
brother
and
marry
another
.
 
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
and
say
,
"
then
I
be
ruin
,
"
mean
himself
;
and
that
moment
his
sister
enter
the
room
and
tell
him
she
could
not
find
the
flute
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
he
merrily
,
"
this
laziness
will
not
do
"
;
so
he
get
up
and
go
himself
to
go
to
look
for
it
,
but
come
back
without
it
too
;
<EOS>
not
but
that
he
could
have
find
it
,
but
because
his
mind
be
a
little
disturbed
,
and
he
have
no
mind
to
play
;
and
,
besides
,
the
errand
he
send
his
sister
on
be
answer
another
way
;
for
he
only
want
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
me
,
which
he
gain
,
though
not
much
to
his
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
however
,
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
in
have
speak
my
mind
to
him
with
freedom
,
and
with
such
an
honest
plainness
,
as
I
have
relate
;
and
though
it
do
not
at
all
work
the
way
I
desire
,
that
be
to
say
,
to
oblige
the
person
to
me
the
more
,
yet
it
take
from
him
all
possibility
of
quit
me
but
by
a
downright
breach
of
honour
,
and
give
up
all
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
to
me
,
which
he
have
so
often
engage
by
,
never
to
abandon
me
,
but
to
make
me
his
wife
as
soon
as
he
come
to
his
estate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
many
week
after
this
before
I
be
about
the
house
again
,
and
begin
to
grow
well
;
but
I
continue
melancholy
,
silent
,
dull
,
and
retire
,
which
amaze
the
whole
family
,
except
he
that
know
the
reason
of
it
;
yet
it
be
a
great
while
before
he
take
any
notice
of
it
,
and
I
,
as
backward
to
speak
as
he
,
carry
respectfully
to
him
,
but
never
offer
to
speak
a
word
to
him
that
be
particular
of
any
kind
whatsoever
;
and
this
continue
for
sixteen
or
seventeen
week
;
so
that
,
as
I
expect
every
day
to
be
dismiss
the
family
,
on
account
of
what
distaste
they
have
take
another
way
,
in
which
I
have
no
guilt
,
so
I
expect
to
hear
no
more
of
this
gentleman
,
after
all
his
solemn
vow
and
protestation
,
but
to
be
ruin
and
abandon
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
I
break
the
way
myself
in
the
family
for
my
removing
;
for
be
talk
seriously
with
the
old
lady
one
day
,
about
my
own
circumstance
in
the
world
,
and
how
my
distemper
have
leave
a
heaviness
upon
my
spirit
,
that
I
be
not
the
same
thing
I
be
before
,
the
old
lady
say
,
"
I
be
afraid
,
<EOS>
Betty

what
I
have
say
to
you
about
my

some
influence
upon

and
that
you
be
melancholy
on
his
account
;
pray

will
you
let
me
know
how
the
matter
stand
with
you
both
,
if
it
may
not
be
improper

<EOS>
for

as
for
Robin

he

when
I
speak
of
it
to
him

<EOS>
"
why

<EOS>
Mr.

have
several
time
propose
marriage
to
me
,
which
be
what
I
have
no
reason
to

my
poor
circumstance
consider
;
but
I
have
always
resist
him
,
and
that
perhaps
in
term
more
positive
than
become
me
,
consider
the
regard
that
I
ought
to
have
for
every
branch
of
your

,

say
I

I
could
never
so
far
forget
my
obligation

all
your

to
offer
to

to
a
thing
which
I
know
must
need
be
disoblige
to
you

and
this
I
have
make
my
argument
to
him
,
and
have
positively
tell
him
that
I
would
never
entertain
a
thought
of
that
kind
unless
I
have
your

<EOS>
"
then
you
have
be
much
juster
to

than
we

for
we
have
all
look
upon
you
as
a
kind
of
snare
to
my
son
,
and
I
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
for
your
removing

for
fear
of

I

not

one

the

Robin

<EOS>
this
answer
be
surprising

less
to
the

to

they
stand
mute

passion

well

I
have
hear
this

they
we

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
confess
,
"
say
the
mother
,
"
it
be
none
of
her
fault

if
he
be
fool
enough
to
take
a
fancy
to

to
give
such
an
answer
to
him
,
show
more
respect
to
your
father

me
than
I
can
tell
how
to
express

I

value
the

I

<EOS>
"
I
will
consider
of
that
a

the
mother
;
"
I
assure
you
,
if
there
be
not
some
other
objection
in

this
conduct

I

"
why

Robin

again

be
you

Would
you
so
fain

you
pretend

"
 
<EOS>
"
really
,
madam

,
"

I
think
'

hard

head

all
I
have

<EOS>
I
will
not

I

<EOS>
besides

I
be
not
bind

this
I

I

so
you
may
determine
for
me
.
<EOS>
Betty
or
nobody
be
the
word
,
and
the
question
which
of
the
two
shall
be
in
your
breast
to
decide
,
madam
,
provide
only
,
that
my
good
-
humoured
sister
here
may
have
no
vote
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
dreadful
to
me
,
for
the
mother
begin
to
yield
,
and
Robin
press
her
home
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
she
advise
with
the
eld
son
,
and
he
use
all
the
argument
in
the
world
to
persuade
her
to
consent
;
allege
his
brother
's
passionate
love
for
me
,
and
my
generous
regard
to
the
family
,
in
refuse
my
own
advantage
upon
such
a
nice
point
of
honour
,
and
a
thousand
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
father
,
he
be
a
man
in
a
hurry
of
public
affair
and
get
money
,
seldom
at
home
,
thoughtful
of
the
main
chance
,
but
leave
all
those
thing
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
easily
believe
,
that
when
the
plot
be
thus
,
as
they
think
,
break
out
,
and
that
every
one
think
they
know
how
thing
be
carry
,
it
be
not
so
difficult
or
so
dangerous
for
the
eld
brother
,
whom
nobody
suspect
of
anything
,
to
have
a
free
access
to
me
than
before
;
nay
,
the
mother
,
which
be
just
as
he
wish
,
propose
it
to
him
to
talk
with
Mrs.
Betty
.
<EOS>
"
for
it
may
be
,
son
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
may
see
farther
into
the
thing
than
I
,
and
see
if
you
think
she
have
be
so
positive
as
Robin
say
she
have
be
,
or
no
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
as
well
as
he
could
wish
,
and
he
,
as
it
be
,
yield
to
talk
with
me
at
his
mother
's
request
,
she
bring
me
to
him
into
her
own
chamber
,
tell
me
her
son
have
some
business
with
me
at
her
request
,
and
desire
me
to
be
very
sincere
with
him
,
and
then
she
leave
us
together
,
and
he
go
and
shut
the
door
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
back
to
me
and
take
me
in
his
arm
,
and
kiss
me
very
tenderly
;
but
tell
me
he
have
a
long
discourse
to
hold
with
me
,
and
it
be
not
come
to
that
crisis
,
that
I
should
make
myself
happy
or
miserable
as
long
as
I
live
;
that
the
thing
be
now
go
so
far
,
that
if
I
could
not
comply
with
his
desire
,
we
would
both
be
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
tell
the
whole
story
between
Robin
,
as
he
call
him
,
and
his
mother
and
sister
and
himself
,
as
it
be
above
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
dear
child
,
"
say
he
,
"
consider
what
it
will
be
to
marry
a
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
in
good
circumstance
,
and
with
the
consent
of
the
whole
house
,
and
to
enjoy
all
that
he
world
can
give
you
;
and
what
,
on
the
other
hand
,
to
be
sink
into
the
dark
circumstance
of
a
woman
that
have
lose
her
reputation
;
and
that
though
I
shall
be
a
private
friend
to
you
while
I
live
,
yet
as
I
shall
be
suspect
always
,
so
you
will
be
afraid
to
see
me
,
and
I
shall
be
afraid
to
own
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
no
time
to
reply
,
but
go
on
with
me
thus
:
 
"
what
have
happen
between
us
,
child
,
so
long
as
we
both
agree
to
do
so
,
may
be
bury
and
forget
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
be
your
sincere
friend
,
without
any
inclination
to
nearer
intimacy
,
when
you
become
my
sister
;
and
we
shall
have
all
the
honest
part
of
conversation
without
any
reproach
between
us
of
have
do
amiss
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
of
you
to
consider
it
,
and
to
not
stand
in
the
way
of
your
own
safety
and
prosperity
;
and
to
satisfy
you
that
I
be
sincere
,
"
add
he
,
"
I
here
offer
you
#
#
#
#
500
in
money
,
to
make
you
some
amend
for
the
freedom
I
have
take
with
you
,
which
we
shall
look
upon
as
some
of
the
folly
of
our
life
,
 
which
'
tis
hope
we
may
repent
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
this
in
so
much
more
move
term
than
it
be
possible
for
me
to
express
,
and
with
so
much
great
force
of
argument
than
I
can
repeat
,
that
I
only
recommend
it
to
those
who
read
the
story
,
to
suppose
,
that
as
he
hold
me
above
an
hour
and
a
half
in
that
discourse
,
so
he
answer
all
my
objection
,
and
fortify
his
discourse
with
all
the
argument
that
human
wit
and
art
could
devise
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
however
,
that
anything
he
say
make
impression
enough
upon
me
so
as
to
give
me
any
thought
of
the
matter
,
till
he
tell
me
at
last
very
plainly
,
that
if
I
refuse
,
he
be
sorry
to
add
that
he
could
never
go
on
with
me
in
that
station
as
we
stand
before
;
that
though
he
love
me
as
well
as
ever
,
and
that
I
be
as
agreeable
to
him
as
ever
,
yet
sense
of
virtue
have
not
so
far
forsaken
him
as
to
suffer
him
to
lie
with
a
woman
that
his
brother
court
to
make
his
wife
;
and
if
he
take
his
leave
of
me
,
with
a
denial
in
this
affair
,
whatever
he
may
do
for
me
in
the
point
of
support
,
ground
on
his
first
engagement
of
maintain
me
,
yet
he
would
not
have
me
be
surprised
that
he
be
oblige
to
tell
me
he
could
not
allow
himself
to
see
me
any
more
;
and
that
,
indeed
,
I
could
not
expect
it
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
receive
this
last
part
with
some
token
of
surprise
and
disorder
,
and
have
much
ado
to
avoid
sink
down
,
for
indeed
I
love
him
to
an
extravagance
not
easy
to
imagine
;
but
he
perceive
my
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreat
me
to
consider
seriously
of
it
;
assure
me
that
it
be
the
only
way
to
preserve
our
mutual
affection
;
that
in
this
station
we
may
love
as
friend
,
with
the
utmost
passion
,
and
with
a
love
of
relation
untainted
,
free
from
our
just
reproach
,
and
free
from
other
people
's
suspicion
;
that
he
should
ever
acknowledge
his
happiness
owe
to
me
;
that
he
would
be
debtor
to
me
as
long
as
he
live
,
and
would
be
pay
that
debt
as
long
as
he
have
breath
.
<EOS>
thus
he
work
me
up
,
in
short
,
to
a
kind
of
hesitation
in
the
matter
;
have
the
danger
on
one
side
represent
in
lively
figure
,
and
indeed
,
heighten
by
my
imagination
of
be
turn
out
to
the
wide
world
a
mere
cast
-
off
whore
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
no
less
,
and
perhaps
expose
as
such
,
with
little
to
provide
for
 
myself
,
with
no
friend
,
no
acquaintance
in
the
whole
world
,
out
of
that
town
,
and
there
I
could
not
pretend
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
terrify
me
to
the
last
degree
,
and
he
take
care
upon
all
occasion
to
lay
it
home
to
me
in
the
bad
colour
that
it
could
be
possible
to
be
draw
in
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
fail
not
to
set
forth
the
easy
,
prosperous
life
which
I
be
go
to
live
.
  
<EOS>
He
answer
all
that
I
could
object
from
affection
,
and
from
former
engagement
,
with
tell
me
the
necessity
that
be
before
us
of
take
other
measure
now
;
and
as
to
his
promise
of
marriage
,
the
nature
of
thing
,
he
say
,
have
put
an
end
to
that
,
by
the
probability
of
my
be
his
brother
's
wife
,
before
the
time
to
which
his
promise
all
refer
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
in
a
word
,
I
may
say
,
he
reason
me
out
of
my
reason
;
he
conquer
all
my
argument
,
and
I
begin
to
see
a
danger
that
I
be
in
,
which
I
have
not
consider
of
before
,
and
that
be
,
of
be
drop
by
both
of
them
and
leave
alone
in
the
world
to
shift
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
and
his
persuasion
,
at
length
prevail
with
me
to
consent
,
though
with
so
much
reluctance
,
that
it
be
easy
to
see
I
should
go
to
church
like
a
bear
to
the
stake
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
some
little
apprehension
about
me
,
too
,
lest
my
new
spouse
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
I
have
not
the
least
affection
for
,
should
be
skillful
enough
to
challenge
me
on
another
account
,
upon
our
first
come
to
bed
together
.
 
<EOS>
but
whether
he
do
it
with
design
or
not
,
I
know
not
,
but
his
eld
brother
take
care
to
make
him
very
much
fuddle
before
he
go
to
bed
,
so
that
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
a
drunken
bedfellow
the
first
night
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
do
it
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
<EOS>
but
I
conclude
that
he
certainly
contrive
it
,
that
his
brother
may
be
able
to
make
no
judgment
of
the
difference
between
a
maid
and
a
married
woman
;
nor
do
he
ever
entertain
any
notion
of
it
,
or
disturb
his
thought
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
go
back
a
little
here
to
where
I
leave
off
.
 
<EOS>
the
eld
brother
have
thus
manage
me
,
his
next
business
be
to
manage
his
mother
,
and
he
never
leave
till
he
have
bring
her
to
acquiesce
and
be
passive
in
the
thing
,
even
without
acquaint
the
father
,
other
than
by
post
letter
;
so
that
she
consent
to
our
marrying
privately
,
and
leave
her
to
mange
the
father
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
cajole
with
his
brother
,
and
persuade
him
what
service
he
have
do
him
,
and
how
he
have
bring
his
mother
to
consent
,
which
,
though
true
,
be
not
indeed
do
to
serve
him
,
but
to
serve
himself
;
but
thus
diligently
do
he
cheat
him
,
and
have
the
thank
of
a
faithful
friend
for
shift
off
his
whore
into
his
brother
's
arm
for
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
so
certainly
do
interest
banish
all
manner
of
affection
,
and
so
naturally
do
man
give
up
honour
and
justice
,
humanity
,
and
even
Christianity
,
to
secure
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
now
come
back
to
brother
Robin
,
as
we
always
call
him
,
who
have
get
his
mother
's
consent
,
as
above
,
come
big
with
the
news
to
me
,
and
tell
me
the
whole
story
of
it
,
with
a
sincerity
so
visible
,
that
I
must
confess
it
grieved
me
that
I
must
be
the
instrument
to
abuse
so
honest
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
remedy
;
he
would
have
me
,
and
I
be
not
oblige
to
tell
him
that
I
be
his
brother
's
whore
,
though
I
have
no
other
way
to
put
him
off
;
so
I
come
gradually
into
it
,
to
his
satisfaction
,
and
behold
<EOS>
we
be
married
.
  
<EOS>
modesty
forbid
me
to
reveal
the
secret
of
the
marriage
-
bed
,
but
nothing
could
have
happen
more
suitable
to
my
circumstance
than
that
,
as
above
,
my
husband
be
so
fuddle
when
he
come
to
bed
,
that
he
could
not
remember
in
the
morning
whether
he
have
have
any
conversation
with
me
or
no
,
and
I
be
oblige
to
tell
him
he
have
,
though
in
reality
he
have
not
,
that
I
may
be
sure
he
could
make
to
inquiry
about
anything
else
.
  
<EOS>
It
concern
the
story
in
hand
very
little
to
enter
into
the
further
particular
of
the
family
,
or
of
myself
,
for
the
five
year
that
I
live
with
this
husband
,
only
to
observe
that
I
have
two
child
by
him
,
and
that
at
the
end
of
five
year
he
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
really
a
very
good
husband
to
me
,
and
we
live
very
agreeably
together
;
but
as
he
have
not
receive
much
from
them
,
and
have
in
the
little
time
he
live
acquire
no
great
matter
,
so
my
circumstance
be
not
great
,
nor
be
I
much
mend
by
the
match
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
preserve
the
eld
brother
's
bond
to
me
,
to
pay
#
#
#
#
500
,
which
he
offer
me
for
my
consent
to
marry
his
brother
;
and
this
,
with
what
I
have
save
of
the
money
he
formerly
give
me
,
about
as
much
more
by
my
husband
,
leave
me
a
widow
with
about
#
#
#
#
1200
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
My
two
child
be
,
indeed
,
take
happily
off
my
hand
by
my
husband
's
father
and
mother
,
and
that
,
by
the
way
,
be
all
they
get
by
Mrs.
Betty
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
not
suitably
affect
with
the
loss
of
my
husband
,
nor
indeed
can
I
say
that
I
ever
love
him
as
I
ought
to
have
do
,
or
as
be
proportionable
to
the
good
usage
I
have
from
him
,
for
he
be
a
tender
,
kind
,
good
-
humoured
man
as
any
woman
could
desire
;
but
his
brother
be
so
always
in
my
sight
,
at
least
while
we
be
in
the
country
,
be
a
continual
snare
to
me
,
and
I
never
be
in
bed
with
my
husband
<EOS>
but
I
wish
myself
in
the
arm
of
his
brother
;
and
though
his
brother
never
offer
me
the
least
kindness
that
way
after
our
marriage
,
but
carry
it
just
as
a
brother
out
to
do
,
yet
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
to
him
;
in
short
,
I
commit
adultery
and
incest
with
him
every
day
in
my
desire
,
which
,
without
doubt
,
be
as
effectually
criminal
in
the
nature
of
the
guilt
as
if
I
have
actually
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
before
my
husband
die
his
eld
brother
be
married
,
and
we
,
be
then
remove
to
London
,
be
write
to
by
the
old
lady
to
come
and
be
at
the
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
go
,
but
I
pretend
indisposition
,
and
that
I
could
not
possibly
travel
,
so
I
stay
behind
;
for
,
in
short
,
I
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
his
be
give
to
another
woman
,
though
I
know
I
be
never
to
have
him
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
,
as
above
,
leave
loose
to
the
world
,
and
be
still
young
and
handsome
,
as
everybody
say
of
me
,
and
I
assure
you
I
think
myself
so
,
and
with
a
tolerable
fortune
in
my
pocket
,
I
put
no
small
value
upon
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
court
by
several
very
considerable
tradesman
,
and
particularly
very
warmly
by
one
,
a
linen
-
draper
,
at
whose
house
,
after
my
husband
's
death
<EOS>
,
I
take
a
lodging
,
his
sister
be
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
here
I
have
all
the
liberty
and
all
the
opportunity
to
be
gay
and
appear
in
company
that
I
could
desire
,
my
landlord
's
sister
be
one
of
the
maddest
,
gay
thing
alive
,
and
not
so
much
mistress
of
her
virtue
as
I
think
as
first
she
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
bring
me
into
a
world
of
 
wild
company
,
and
even
bring
home
several
person
,
such
as
she
like
well
enough
to
gratify
,
to
see
her
pretty
widow
,
so
she
be
pleased
to
call
me
,
and
that
name
I
get
in
a
little
time
in
public
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
as
fame
and
fool
make
an
assembly
,
I
be
here
wonderfully
caress
,
have
abundance
of
admirer
,
and
such
as
call
themselves
lover
;
but
I
find
not
one
fair
proposal
among
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
their
common
design
,
that
I
understand
too
well
to
be
draw
into
any
more
snare
of
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
the
case
be
alter
with
me
:
I
have
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
trick
once
by
that
cheat
call
love
,
but
the
game
be
over
;
 
I
be
resolve
now
to
be
marry
or
nothing
,
and
to
be
well
married
or
not
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
love
the
company
,
indeed
,
of
man
of
mirth
and
wit
,
man
of
gallantry
and
figure
,
and
be
often
entertain
with
such
,
as
I
be
also
with
other
;
but
I
find
by
just
observation
,
that
the
bright
man
come
upon
the
dull
<EOS>
errand
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
the
dull
as
to
what
I
aim
at
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
those
who
come
with
the
good
proposal
be
the
dull
and
most
disagreeable
part
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
averse
to
a
tradesman
,
but
then
I
would
have
a
tradesman
,
forsooth
<EOS>
,
that
be
something
of
a
gentleman
too
;
that
when
my
husband
have
a
mind
to
carry
me
to
the
court
,
or
to
the
play
,
he
may
become
a
sword
,
and
look
as
like
a
gentleman
as
another
man
;
and
not
be
one
that
have
the
mark
of
his
apron
-
string
upon
his
coat
,
or
the
mark
of
his
hat
upon
his
periwig
;
that
should
look
as
if
he
be
set
on
to
his
sword
,
when
his
sword
be
put
on
to
him
,
and
that
carry
his
trade
in
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
at
last
I
find
this
amphibious
creature
,
this
land
-
water
thing
call
a
gentleman
-
tradesman
;
and
as
a
just
plague
upon
my
folly
,
I
be
catch
in
the
very
snare
which
,
as
I
may
say
,
I
lay
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
for
myself
,
for
I
be
not
trepan
,
I
confess
,
but
I
betray
myself
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
draper
,
too
,
for
though
my
comrade
would
have
bring
me
to
a
bargain
with
her
brother
,
yet
when
it
come
to
the
point
,
it
be
,
it
seem
,
for
a
mistress
,
not
a
wife
;
and
I
keep
true
to
this
notion
,
that
a
woman
should
never
be
keep
for
a
mistress
that
have
money
to
keep
herself
.
  
<EOS>
thus
my
pride
,
not
my
principle
,
my
money
,
not
my
virtue
,
keep
me
honest
;
though
,
as
it
prove
,
I
find
I
have
much
well
have
be
sell
by
my
she
-
comrade
to
her
brother
,
than
have
sell
myself
as
I
do
to
a
tradesman
that
be
rake
,
gentleman
,
shopkeeper
,
and
beggar
,
all
together
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
hurry
on
(
by
my
fancy
to
a
gentleman
)
to
ruin
myself
in
the
gross
manner
that
every
woman
do
;
for
my
new
husband
come
to
a
lump
of
money
at
once
,
fall
into
such
a
profusion
of
expense
,
that
all
I
have
,
and
all
he
have
before
,
if
he
have
anything
worth
mention
,
would
not
have
hold
it
out
above
one
year
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
very
fond
of
me
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
year
,
and
what
I
get
by
that
be
,
that
I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
a
great
deal
of
my
money
spend
upon
myself
,
and
,
as
I
may
say
,
have
some
of
the
spending
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
to
me
one
day
,
"
shall
we
go
and
take
a
turn
into
the
country
for
about
a
week

We

Oxford

<EOS>
"
too
far

say
he
;
"
no
place

too
far
for
a

if
I
carry
you
out

you
shall
travel
like
a
duchess

<EOS>
"
Hum
,
"
say
I
,
"
my
dear
,
'
tis
a
frolic
;
but
if
you
have
a
mind
to
it
,
I
do
not

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
well
,
the
time
be
appoint
,
we
have
a
rich
coach
,
very
good
horse
,
a
coachman
,
postillion
,
and
two
footman
in
very
good
livery
;
a
gentleman
on
horseback
,
and
a
page
with
a
feather
in
his
hat
upon
another
horse
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
all
call
him
my
lord
,
and
the
inn
-
keepers
,
you
may
be
sure
,
do
the
like
,
and
I
be
her
honour
the
Countess

and
thus
we
travel
to
Oxford
,
and
a
very
pleasant
journey
we
have
;
for
,
give
him
his
due
,
not
a
beggar
alive
know
better
how
to
be
a
lord
than
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
all
the
rarity
at
Oxford
,
talk
with
two
or
three
fellow
of
college
about
put
out
a
young
nephew
,
that
be
leave
to
his
lordship
's
care
,
to
the
University
,
and
of
their
be
his
tutor
.
 
<EOS>
We
divert
ourselves
with
banter
several
other
poor
scholar
,
with
hope
of
be
at
least
his
lordship
's
chaplain
and
put
on
a
scarf
;
and
thus
have
live
like
quality
indeed
,
as
to
expense
,
we
go
away
for
Northampton
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
in
about
twelve
day
"
ramble
come
home
again
,
to
the

of

<EOS>
vanity
be
the
perfection
of
a
fop
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
have
this
excellence
,
that
he
value
nothing
of
expense
;
and
as
his
history
,
you
may
be
sure
,
have
very
little
weight
in
it
,
'
tis
enough
to
tell
you
that
in
about
two
year
and
a
quarter
he
break
,
and
be
not
so
happy
to
get
over
into
the
Mint
,
but
get
into
a
sponging
-
house
,
be
arrest
in
an
action
too
heavy
from
him
to
give
bail
to
,
so
he
send
for
me
to
come
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
surprise
to
me
,
for
I
have
foresee
some
time
that
all
be
go
to
wreck
,
and
have
be
take
care
to
reserve
something
if
I
could
,
though
it
be
not
much
,
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
send
for
me
,
he
behave
much
well
than
I
expect
,
and
tell
me
plainly
he
have
play
the
fool
,
and
suffer
himself
to
be
surprised
,
which
he
may
have
prevent
;
that
now
he
foresee
he
could
not
stand
it
,
and
therefore
he
would
have
me
go
home
,
and
in
the
night
take
away
everything
I
have
in
the
house
of
any
value
,
and
secure
it
;
and
after
that
,
he
tell
me
that
if
I
could
get
away
one
hundred
or
two
hundred
pound
in
good
out
of
the
shop
,
I
should
do
it
;
"
only
,
"
say
he
,
"
let
me
know
nothing
of
it
,
neither
what
you
take
nor
whither
<EOS>
you
carry
it
;
for
as
for
me
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
resolve
to
get
out
of
this
house
and
be
go
;
and
if
you
never
hear
of
me
more
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
well
;
I
be
only
sorry
for
the
injury
I
have
do
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
some
very
handsome
thing
to
me
indeed
at
parting
;
for
I
tell
you
he
be
a
gentleman
,
and
that
be
all
the
benefit
 
<EOS>
I
have
of
his
be
so
;
that
he
use
me
very
handsomely
and
with
good
manner
upon
all
occasion
,
even
to
the
last
,
only
spend
all
I
have
,
and
leave
me
to
rob
the
creditor
for
something
to
subsist
on
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
as
he
bid
me
,
that
you
may
be
sure
;
and
have
thus
take
my
leave
of
him
<EOS>
,
I
never
see
him
more
,
for
he
find
mean
to
break
out
of
the
bailiff
's
house
that
night
or
the
next
,
and
go
over
into
France
,
and
for
the
rest
of
the
creditor
scramble
for
it
as
well
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
how
,
I
know
not
,
for
I
could
come
at
no
knowledge
of
anything
,
more
than
this
,
that
he
come
home
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
cause
the
rest
of
his
good
to
be
remove
into
the
Mint
,
and
the
shop
to
be
shut
up
;
and
have
raise
what
money
he
could
get
together
,
he
get
over
,
as
I
say
,
to
France
,
from
whence
I
have
one
or
two
letter
from
him
,
and
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
him
when
he
come
home
,
for
he
have
give
me
such
instruction
as
above
,
and
I
have
make
the
good
of
my
time
,
I
have
no
more
business
back
again
at
the
house
,
not
know
<EOS>
but
I
may
have
be
stop
there
by
the
creditor
;
for
a
commission
of
bankrupt
be
soon
after
issue
,
they
may
have
stop
me
by
order
from
the
commissioner
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
husband
,
have
so
dexterously
get
out
of
the
bailiff
's
house
by
let
himself
down
in
a
most
desperate
manner
from
almost
the
top
of
the
house
to
the
top
of
another
building
,
and
leap
from
thence
,
which
be
almost
two
storey
,
and
which
be
enough
indeed
to
have
break
his
neck
,
he
come
home
and
get
away
his
good
before
the
creditor
could
come
to
seize
;
that
be
to
say
,
before
they
could
get
out
the
commission
,
and
be
ready
to
send
their
officer
to
take
possession
.
  
<EOS>
My
husband
be
so
civil
to
me
,
for
still
I
say
he
be
much
of
a
gentleman
,
that
in
the
first
letter
he
write
me
from
France
<EOS>
,
he
let
me
know
where
he
have
pawn
twenty
piece
of
fine
holland
for
#
#
#
#
30
,
which
be
really
worth
#
#
#
#
90
,
and
enclose
me
the
token
and
an
order
for
the
take
them
up
,
pay
the
money
,
which
I
do
,
and
make
in
time
above
#
#
#
#
100
of
them
,
have
leisure
to
cut
them
and
sell
them
,
some
and
some
,
to
private
family
,
as
opportunity
offer
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
with
all
this
,
and
all
that
I
have
secure
before
,
I
find
,
upon
cast
thing
up
,
my
case
be
very
much
alter
,
any
my
fortune
much
lessen
;
for
,
include
the
holland
and
a
parcel
of
fine
muslin
,
which
I
carry
off
before
,
and
some
plate
,
and
other
thing
<EOS>
,
I
find
I
could
hardly
muster
up
#
#
#
#
500
;
and
my
condition
be
very
odd
,
for
though
I
have
no
child
(
I
have
have
one
by
my
gentleman
draper
,
but
it
be
bury
)
,
yet
<EOS>
I
be
a
widow
bewitch
;
I
have
a
husband
and
no
husband
,
and
I
could
not
pretend
to
marry
again
,
though
I
know
well
enough
<EOS>
my
husband
would
never
see
England
any
more
,
if
he
live
fifty
year
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
I
say
,
I
be
limit
from
marriage
,
what
offer
may
soever
be
make
me
;
and
I
have
not
one
friend
to
advise
with
in
the
condition
I
be
in
,
<EOS>
least
not
one
I
durst
trust
the
secret
of
my
circumstance
to
,
for
if
the
commissioner
be
to
have
be
inform
where
I
be
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
be
fetch
up
and
examine
upon
oath
,
and
all
I
have
save
be
take
away
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
apprehension
,
the
first
thing
I
do
be
to
go
quite
out
of
my
knowledge
,
and
go
by
another
name
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
do
effectually
,
for
I
go
into
the
Mint
too
,
take
lodging
in
a
very
private
place
,
dress
up
in
the
habit
of
a
widow
,
and
call
myself
Mrs.
Flanders
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
I
conceal
myself
,
and
though
my
new
acquaintance
know
nothing
of
me
,
yet
I
soon
get
a
great
deal
of
company
about
me
;
and
whether
it
be
that
woman
be
scarce
among
the
sort
of
people
that
generally
be
to
be
find
there
,
or
that
some
consolation
in
the
misery
of
the
place
be
more
requisite
than
on
other
occasion
<EOS>
,
I
soon
find
an
agreeable
woman
be
exceedingly
valuable
among
the
son
of
affliction
there
,
and
that
those
that
want
money
to
pay
half
a
crown
on
the
pound
to
their
creditor
,
and
that
run
in
debt
at
the
sign
of
the
Bull
for
their
dinner
,
would
yet
find
money
for
a
supper
,
if
they
like
the
woman
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
keep
myself
safe
yet
,
though
I
begin
,
like
my
Lord
Rochester
's
mistress
,
that
love
his
company
,
but
would
not
admit
him
farther
,
to
have
the
scandal
of
a
whore
,
without
the
joy
;
and
upon
this
score
,
tired
with
the
place
,
and
indeed
with
the
company
too
,
I
begin
to
think
of
remove
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
subject
of
strange
reflection
to
me
to
see
man
who
be
overwhelm
in
perplex
circumstance
,
who
be
reduce
some
degree
below
be
ruin
,
whose
family
be
object
of
their
own
terror
and
other
people
's
charity
,
yet
while
a
penny
last
,
nay
,
even
beyond
it
,
endeavour
to
drown
themselves
,
labour
to
forget
former
thing
,
which
now
it
be
the
proper
time
to
remember
,
make
more
work
for
repentance
,
and
sin
on
,
as
a
remedy
for
sin
past
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
none
of
my
talent
to
preach
;
these
man
be
too
wicked
,
even
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
horrid
and
absurd
in
their
way
of
sinning
,
for
it
be
all
a
force
even
upon
themselves
;
they
do
not
only
act
against
conscience
,
but
against
nature
;
they
put
a
rape
upon
their
temper
to
drown
the
reflection
,
which
their
circumstance
continually
give
them
;
and
nothing
be
more
easy
than
to
see
how
sigh
would
interrupt
their
song
,
and
paleness
and
anguish
sit
upon
their
brow
,
in
spite
of
the
force
smile
they
put
on
;
nay
,
sometimes
it
would
break
out
at
their
very
mouth
when
they
have
part
with
their
money
for
a
lewd
treat
or
a
wicked
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
them
,
turn
about
,
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
cry
,
<EOS>
"
what
a
dog
be
I
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
Betty
,
my
dear
,
I
will
drink
thy
health
,
though
"
;
mean
the
honest
wife
,
that
perhaps
have
not
a
half
-
crown
for
herself
and
three
or
four
child
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
they
be
at
their
penitential
again
;
and
perhaps
the
poor
weeping
wife
come
over
to
him
,
either
bring
him
some
account
of
what
his
creditor
be
do
,
and
how
she
and
the
child
be
turn
out
of
door
,
or
some
other
dreadful
news
;
and
this
add
to
his
self
-
reproach
;
but
when
he
have
think
and
pore
on
it
till
he
be
almost
mad
,
have
no
principle
to
support
him
,
nothing
within
him
or
above
him
to
comfort
him
,
but
find
it
all
darkness
on
every
side
,
he
fly
to
the
same
relief
again
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
drink
it
away
,
debauch
it
away
,
and
fall
into
company
of
man
in
just
the
same
condition
with
himself
,
he
repeat
the
crime
,
and
thus
he
go
every
day
one
step
onward
of
his
way
to
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
wicked
enough
for
such
fellow
as
these
yet
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
begin
to
consider
here
very
seriously
what
I
have
to
do
;
how
thing
stand
with
me
,
and
what
course
I
ought
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
no
friend
,
no
,
not
one
friend
or
relation
in
the
world
;
and
that
little
I
have
leave
apparently
waste
,
which
when
it
be
go
,
I
see
nothing
but
misery
and
starving
be
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
upon
these
consideration
,
I
say
,
and
fill
with
horror
at
the
place
I
be
in
,
and
the
dreadful
object
which
I
have
always
before
me
,
I
resolve
to
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
make
an
acquaintance
with
a
very
sober
,
good
sort
of
a
woman
,
who
be
a
widow
too
,
like
me
,
but
in
well
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
have
be
a
captain
of
a
merchant
ship
,
and
have
have
the
misfortune
to
be
cast
away
come
home
on
a
voyage
from
the
West
Indies
,
which
would
have
be
very
profitable
if
he
have
come
safe
,
be
so
reduce
by
the
loss
,
that
though
he
have
save
his
life
then
,
it
break
his
heart
,
and
kill
him
afterwards
;
and
his
widow
,
be
pursue
by
the
creditor
,
be
force
to
take
shelter
in
the
Mint
.
 
<EOS>
She
soon
make
thing
up
with
the
help
of
friend
,
and
be
at
liberty
again
;
and
find
that
I
rather
be
there
to
be
conceal
,
than
by
any
particular
prosecution
and
find
also
that
I
agree
with
her
,
or
rather
she
with
me
,
in
a
just
abhorrence
of
the
place
and
of
the
company
,
she
invite
to
go
home
with
her
till
I
could
put
myself
in
some
posture
of
settle
in
the
world
to
my
mind
;
withal
tell
me
,
that
it
be
ten
to
one
but
some
good
captain
of
a
ship
may
take
a
fancy
to
me
,
and
court
me
,
in
that
part
of
the
town
where
she
live
.
  
<EOS>
I
accept
her
offer
,
and
be
with
her
half
a
year
,
and
should
have
be
long
,
but
in
that
interval
what
she
propose
to
me
happen
to
herself
,
and
she
marry
very
much
to
her
advantage
.
<EOS>
but
whose
fortune
soever
be
upon
the
increase
,
mine
seem
to
be
upon
the
wane
,
and
I
find
nothing
present
,
except
two
or
three
boatswain
,
or
such
fellow
,
but
as
for
the
commander
,
they
be
generally
of
two
sort
:
 
1
.
<EOS>
such
as
,
have
good
business
,
that
be
to
say
,
a
good
ship
,
resolve
not
to
marry
but
with
advantage
,
that
is
,
with
a
good
fortune
;
2
.
<EOS>
such
as
,
be
out
of
employ
,
want
a
wife
to
help
them
to
a
ship
;
I
mean
<EOS>
(
1
)
a
wife
who
,
have
some
money
,
could
enable
them
to
hold
,
as
they
call
it
,
a
good
part
of
a
ship
themselves
,
so
to
encourage
owner
to
come
in
;
or
(
2
)
a
wife
who
,
if
she
have
not
money
,
have
friend
who
be
concern
in
shipping
,
and
so
could
help
to
put
the
young
man
into
a
good
ship
,
which
to
them
be
as
good
as
a
portion
;
and
neither
of
these
be
my
case
<EOS>
,
so
I
look
like
one
that
be
to
lie
on
hand
.
  
<EOS>
this
knowledge
I
soon
learn
by
experience
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
the
state
of
thing
be
alter
as
to
 
matrimony
,
and
that
I
be
not
to
expect
at
London
what
I
have
find
in
the
country
:
 
that
marriage
be
here
the
consequence
of
politic
scheme
for
form
interest
,
and
carry
on
business
,
and
that
Love
have
no
share
,
or
but
very
little
,
in
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
that
as
my
sister
-
in
-
law
at
Colchester
have
say
,
beauty
,
wit
,
manner
,
sense
,
good
humour
,
good
behaviour
,
education
,
virtue
,
piety
,
or
any
other
qualification
,
whether
of
body
or
mind
,
have
no
power
to
recommend
;
that
money
only
make
a
woman
agreeable
;
that
man
choose
mistress
indeed
by
the
gust
of
their
affection
,
and
it
be
requisite
to
a
whore
to
be
handsome
,
well
-
shape
,
have
a
good
mien
and
a
graceful
behaviour
;
but
that
for
a
wife
,
no
deformity
would
shock
the
fancy
,
no
ill
quality
the
judgment
;
the
money
be
the
thing
;
the
portion
be
neither
crooked
nor
monstrous
,
but
the
money
be
always
agreeable
,
whatever
the
wife
be
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
as
the
market
run
very
unhappily
on
the
man
's
side
,
I
find
the
woman
have
lose
the
privilege
of
say
no
;
that
it
be
a
favour
now
for
a
woman
to
have
the
Question
ask
,
and
if
any
young
lady
have
so
much
arrogance
as
to
counterfeit
a
negative
,
she
never
have
the
opportunity
give
her
of
deny
twice
,
much
less
of
recover
that
false
step
,
and
accept
what
she
have
but
seem
to
decline
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
have
such
choice
everywhere
,
that
the
case
of
the
woman
be
very
unhappy
;
for
they
seem
to
ply
at
every
door
,
and
if
the
man
be
by
great
chance
refuse
at
one
house
,
he
be
sure
to
be
receive
at
the
next
.
  
<EOS>
besides
this
,
I
observe
that
the
man
make
no
scruple
to
set
themselves
out
,
and
to
go
a
-
fortunehunting
,
as
they
call
it
,
when
they
have
really
no
fortune
themselves
to
demand
it
,
or
merit
to
deserve
it
;
and
that
they
carry
it
so
high
,
that
a
woman
be
scarce
allow
to
inquire
after
the
character
or
estate
of
the
person
that
pretend
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
have
an
example
of
,
in
a
young
lady
in
the
next
house
to
me
,
and
with
whom
I
have
contract
an
intimacy
;
she
be
court
by
a
young
captain
,
and
though
she
have
near
#
#
#
#
2000
to
her
fortune
,
she
do
<EOS>
but
inquire
of
some
of
his
neighbour
about
his
character
,
his
moral
,
or
substance
,
and
he
take
occasion
at
the
next
visit
to
let
her
know
,
truly
,
that
he
take
it
very
ill
,
and
that
he
should
not
give
her
the
trouble
of
his
visit
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
of
it
,
and
I
have
begin
my
acquaintance
with
her
<EOS>
,
I
go
to
see
her
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
enter
into
a
close
conversation
with
me
about
it
,
and
unbosom
herself
very
freely
.
 
<EOS>
I
perceive
presently
that
though
she
think
herself
very
ill
use
,
yet
she
have
no
power
to
resent
it
,
and
be
exceedingly
pique
that
she
have
lose
him
,
and
particularly
that
another
of
 
less
fortune
have
gain
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
fortify
her
mind
against
such
a
meanness
,
as
I
call
it
;
I
tell
her
,
that
as
low
as
I
be
in
the
world
,
I
would
have
despise
a
man
that
should
think
I
ought
to
take
him
upon
his
own
recommendation
only
,
without
have
the
liberty
to
inform
myself
of
his
fortune
and
of
his
character
;
also
I
tell
her
,
that
as
she
have
a
good
fortune
,
she
have
no
need
to
stoop
to
the
disaster
of
the
time
;
that
it
be
enough
that
the
man
could
insult
us
that
have
but
<EOS>
little
money
to
recommend
us
,
<EOS>
but
if
she
suffer
such
an
affront
to
pass
upon
her
without
resent
it
,
she
would
be
render
low
-
prize
upon
all
occasion
,
and
would
be
the
contempt
of
all
the
woman
in
that
part
of
the
town
;
that
a
woman
can
never
want
an
opportunity
to
be
revenge
of
a
man
that
have
use
her
ill
,
and
that
there
be
way
enough
to
humble
such
a
fellow
as
that
,
or
else
certainly
woman
be
the
most
unhappy
creature
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
she
be
very
well
pleased
with
the
discourse
,
and
she
tell
me
seriously
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
make
him
sensible
of
her
just
resentment
,
and
either
to
bring
him
on
again
,
 
or
have
the
satisfaction
of
her
revenge
be
as
public
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
that
if
she
would
take
my
advice
,
I
would
tell
her
how
she
should
obtain
her
wish
in
both
those
thing
,
and
that
I
would
engage
I
would
bring
the
man
to
her
door
again
,
and
make
him
beg
to
be
let
in
.
 
<EOS>
She
smile
at
that
,
and
soon
let
me
see
,
that
if
he
come
to
her
door
,
her
resentment
be
not
so
great
as
to
give
her
leave
to
let
him
stand
long
there
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
she
listen
very
willingly
to
my
offer
of
advice
;
so
I
tell
her
that
the
first
thing
she
ought
to
do
be
a
piece
of
justice
to
herself
,
namely
,
that
whereas
she
have
be
tell
by
several
people
that
he
have
report
among
the
lady
that
he
have
leave
her
,
and
pretend
to
give
the
advantage
of
the
negative
to
himself
,
she
should
take
care
to
have
it
well
spread
among
the
woman
 
which
she
could
not
fail
of
an
opportunity
to
do
in
a
neighbourhood
so
addict
to
family
news
as
that
she
live
in
<EOS>
be
 
that
she
have
inquire
into
his
circumstance
,
and
find
he
be
not
the
man
as
to
estate
he
pretend
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
let
them
be
tell
,
madam
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
you
have
be
well
inform
that
he
be
not
the
man
that
you
expect
,
and
that
you
think
it
be
not
safe
to
meddle
with
him
<EOS>
;
that
you
hear
he
be
of
an
ill
temper
,
and
that
he
boast
how
he
have
use
the
woman
ill
upon
many
occasion
,
and
that
particularly
he
be
debauch
in
his
moral
"
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
of
which
,
indeed
,
have
some
truth
in
it
;
but
at
the
same
time
I
do
not
find
that
she
seem
to
like
him
much
the
bad
for
that
part
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
put
this
into
her
head
,
she
come
most
readily
into
it
.
<EOS>
immediately
she
go
to
work
to
find
instrument
,
and
she
have
very
little
difficulty
in
the
search
,
for
tell
her
story
in
general
to
a
couple
of
gossip
in
the
neighbourhood
,
it
be
the
chat
of
the
tea
-
table
all
over
that
part
of
the
town
,
and
I
meet
with
it
wherever
I
visit
;
also
,
as
it
be
know
that
I
be
acquaint
with
the
young
lady
herself
,
my
opinion
be
ask
very
often
,
and
I
confirm
it
with
all
the
necessary
aggravation
,
and
set
out
his
character
in
the
black
colour
;
but
then
as
a
piece
of
secret
intelligence
,
I
add
,
as
what
the
other
gossip
know
nothing
of
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
I
have
hear
he
be
in
very
bad
circumstance
;
that
he
be
under
a
necessity
of
a
fortune
to
support
his
interest
with
the
owner
of
the
ship
he
command
;
that
his
own
part
be
not
pay
for
,
and
if
it
be
not
pay
quickly
,
his
owner
would
put
him
out
of
the
ship
,
and
his
chief
mate
be
likely
to
command
it
,
who
offer
to
buy
that
part
which
the
captain
have
promise
to
take
.
  
<EOS>
I
add
,
for
I
confess
I
be
heartily
pique
at
the
rogue
,
as
I
call
him
,
that
I
have
hear
a
rumour
,
too
,
that
he
have
a
wife
alive
at
Plymouth
,
and
another
in
the
West
Indies
,
a
thing
which
they
all
know
be
not
very
uncommon
for
such
kind
of
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
this
work
as
we
both
desire
it
,
for
presently
the
young
lady
next
door
,
who
have
a
father
and
mother
that
govern
both
her
and
her
fortune
,
be
shut
up
,
and
her
father
forbid
him
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
also
in
one
place
more
where
he
go
,
the
woman
have
the
courage
,
however
strange
it
be
,
to
say
no
;
and
he
could
try
nowhere
<EOS>
but
he
be
reproach
with
his
pride
,
and
that
he
pretend
not
to
give
the
woman
leave
to
inquire
into
his
character
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
by
this
time
he
begin
to
be
sensible
of
his
mistake
;
and
have
alarm
all
the
woman
on
that
side
of
the
water
,
he
go
over
to
Ratcliff
,
and
get
access
to
some
of
the
lady
there
;
but
though
the
young
woman
there
too
be
,
accord
to
the
fate
of
the
day
,
pretty
willing
to
be
ask
,
yet
<EOS>
such
be
his
ill
-
luck
,
that
his
character
follow
him
over
the
water
and
his
good
name
be
much
the
same
there
as
it
be
on
our
side
;
so
that
though
he
may
have
have
wife
enough
,
yet
it
do
not
happen
among
the
woman
that
have
good
fortune
,
which
be
what
he
want
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
;
she
very
ingeniously
manage
another
thing
herself
,
for
she
get
a
young
gentleman
,
who
as
a
relation
,
and
be
indeed
a
married
man
,
to
come
and
visit
her
two
or
three
time
a
week
in
a
very
fine
chariot
and
good
livery
,
and
her
two
agent
,
and
<EOS>
I
also
,
presently
spread
a
report
all
over
,
that
this
gentleman
come
to
court
her
;
that
he
be
a
gentleman
of
a
#
#
#
#
1000
a
year
,
and
that
he
be
fall
in
love
with
her
,
and
that
she
be
go
to
her
aunt
be
in
the
city
,
because
it
be
inconvenient
for
the
gentleman
to
come
to
her
with
his
coach
in
Redriff
,
the
street
be
so
narrow
and
difficult
.
  
<EOS>
this
take
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
be
laugh
at
in
all
company
,
and
be
ready
to
hang
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
all
the
way
possible
to
come
at
her
again
,
and
write
the
most
passionate
letter
to
her
in
the
world
,
excuse
his
former
rashness
;
and
in
short
,
by
great
application
,
obtain
leave
to
wait
on
her
again
,
as
he
say
,
to
clear
his
reputation
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
meeting
she
have
her
full
revenge
of
him
;
for
she
tell
him
she
wonder
what
he
take
her
to
be
,
that
she
should
admit
any
man
to
a
treaty
of
so
much
consequence
as
that
to
marriage
,
without
inquire
very
well
into
his
circumstance
;
that
if
he
think
she
be
to
be
huff
into
wedlock
,
and
that
she
be
in
the
same
circumstance
which
her
neighbour
may
be
in
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
take
up
with
the
first
good
Christian
that
come
,
he
be
mistaken
;
that
,
in
a
word
,
his
character
be
really
bad
,
or
he
be
very
ill
beholden
to
his
neighbour
;
and
that
unless
he
could
clear
up
some
point
,
in
which
she
have
justly
be
prejudice
,
she
have
no
more
to
say
to
him
,
but
to
do
herself
justice
,
and
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
know
that
she
be
not
afraid
to
say
no
,
either
to
him
or
any
man
else
.
  
<EOS>
with
that
she
tell
him
what
she
have
hear
,
or
rather
raise
herself
by
my
mean
,
of
his
character
;
his
not
have
pay
for
the
part
he
pretend
to
own
of
the
ship
he
command
;
of
the
resolution
of
his
owner
to
put
him
out
of
the
command
,
and
to
put
his
mate
in
his
stead
;
and
of
the
scandal
raise
on
his
moral
;
his
have
be
reproach
with
such
-
and
-
such
woman
,
and
have
a
wife
at
Plymouth
and
in
the
West
Indies
,
and
the
like
;
and
she
ask
him
whether
he
could
deny
that
she
have
good
reason
,
if
these
thing
be
not
clear
up
,
to
refuse
him
,
and
in
the
meantime
to
insist
upon
have
satisfaction
in
point
to
significant
as
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
confound
at
her
discourse
that
he
could
not
answer
a
word
,
and
she
almost
begin
to
believe
that
all
be
true
,
by
his
disorder
,
though
at
the
same
time
she
know
that
she
have
be
the
raiser
of
all
those
report
herself
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
time
he
recover
himself
a
little
,
and
from
that
time
become
the
most
humble
,
the
most
modest
,
and
most
importunate
man
alive
in
his
courtship
.
  
<EOS>
She
carry
her
jest
on
a
great
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
him
,
if
he
think
she
be
so
at
her
last
shift
that
she
could
or
ought
to
bear
such
treatment
,
and
if
he
do
not
see
that
she
do
not
want
those
who
think
it
worth
their
while
to
come
farther
to
her
than
he
do
;
mean
the
gentleman
whom
she
have
bring
to
visit
her
by
way
of
sham
.
  
<EOS>
She
bring
him
by
these
trick
to
submit
to
all
possible
measure
to
satisfy
her
,
as
well
of
his
circumstance
as
of
his
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
her
undeniable
evidence
of
his
have
pay
for
his
part
of
the
ship
;
he
bring
her
certificate
from
his
owner
,
that
the
report
of
their
intending
to
remove
him
from
the
command
of
the
ship
and
put
his
chief
mate
in
be
false
and
groundless
;
in
short
,
he
be
quite
the
reverse
of
what
he
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
thus
I
convince
her
,
that
if
the
man
make
their
advantage
of
our
sex
in
the
affair
of
marriage
,
upon
the
supposition
of
there
be
such
choice
to
be
have
,
and
of
the
woman
be
so
easy
,
it
be
only
owe
to
this
,
that
the
woman
want
courage
to
maintain
their
ground
and
to
play
their
part
;
and
that
,
accord
to
my
Lord
Rochester
,
       
"
<EOS>
a
woman
's
ne'er
so
ruin
<EOS>
but
she
can
     
revenge
herself
on
her
undoer
,
Man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
these
thing
this
young
lady
play
her
part
so
well
,
that
though
she
resolve
to
have
him
,
and
that
indeed
have
him
be
the
main
bent
of
her
design
,
yet
she
make
his
obtain
her
be
to
him
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
;
and
this
she
do
,
not
by
a
haughty
reserved
carriage
,
but
by
a
just
policy
,
turn
the
table
upon
him
,
and
play
back
upon
him
his
own
game
;
for
as
he
pretend
,
by
a
kind
of
lofty
carriage
,
to
place
himself
above
the
occasion
of
a
character
,
and
to
make
inquire
into
his
character
a
kind
of
an
affront
to
him
,
she
break
with
him
upon
that
subject
,
and
at
the
same
time
that
she
make
him
submit
to
all
possible
inquiry
after
his
affair
,
she
apparently
shut
the
door
against
his
look
into
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
him
to
obtain
her
for
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
what
she
have
,
she
tell
him
plainly
,
that
as
he
know
her
circumstance
,
it
be
but
just
she
should
know
his
;
and
though
at
the
same
time
he
have
only
know
her
circumstance
by
common
fame
,
yet
he
have
make
so
many
protestation
of
his
passion
for
her
,
that
he
could
ask
no
more
but
her
hand
to
his
grand
request
,
and
the
like
ramble
accord
to
the
custom
of
lover
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
leave
himself
no
room
to
ask
any
more
question
about
her
estate
,
and
she
take
the
advantage
of
it
like
a
prudent
woman
,
for
she
place
part
of
her
fortune
so
in
trustee
,
without
let
him
know
anything
of
it
,
that
it
be
quite
out
of
his
reach
,
and
make
him
be
very
well
content
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
she
be
pretty
well
besides
,
that
be
to
say
,
she
have
about
#
#
#
#
1400
in
money
,
which
she
give
him
;
and
the
other
,
after
some
time
,
she
bring
to
light
as
a
perquisite
to
herself
,
which
he
be
to
accept
as
a
mighty
favour
,
see
though
it
be
not
to
be
his
<EOS>
,
it
may
ease
him
in
the
article
of
her
particular
expense
;
and
I
must
add
,
that
by
this
conduct
the
gentleman
himself
become
not
only
the
more
humble
in
his
application
to
her
to
obtain
her
,
but
also
be
much
the
more
an
obliging
husband
to
her
when
he
have
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
remind
the
lady
here
how
much
they
place
themselves
below
the
common
station
of
a
wife
,
which
,
if
I
may
be
allow
not
to
be
partial
,
be
low
enough
already
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
they
place
themselves
below
their
common
station
,
and
prepare
their
own
mortification
,
by
their
submitting
so
to
be
insult
by
the
man
beforehand
,
which
I
confess
I
see
no
necessity
of
.
  
<EOS>
this
relation
may
serve
,
therefore
,
to
let
the
lady
see
that
the
advantage
be
not
so
much
on
the
other
side
as
the
man
think
it
be
;
and
though
it
may
be
true
that
the
man
have
but
too
much
choice
among
us
,
and
that
some
woman
may
be
find
who
will
dishonour
themselves
,
be
cheap
,
and
easy
to
come
at
,
and
will
scarce
wait
to
be
ask
,
yet
if
they
will
have
woman
,
as
I
may
say
,
worth
have
,
they
may
find
them
as
uncomeatable
as
ever
and
that
those
that
be
otherwise
be
a
sort
of
people
that
have
such
deficiency
,
when
have
,
as
rather
recommend
the
lady
that
be
difficult
than
encourage
the
man
to
go
on
with
their
easy
courtship
,
and
expect
wife
equally
valuable
that
will
come
at
first
call
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
more
certain
than
that
the
lady
always
gain
of
the
man
by
keep
their
ground
,
and
let
their
pretended
lover
see
they
can
resent
be
slight
,
and
that
they
be
not
afraid
of
say
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
They
<EOS>
,
I
observe
,
insult
us
mightily
with
tell
us
of
the
number
of
woman
;
that
the
war
,
and
the
sea
,
and
trade
,
and
other
incident
have
carry
the
man
so
much
away
,
that
there
be
no
proportion
between
the
number
of
the
sex
,
and
therefore
the
woman
have
the
disadvantage
;
but
I
be
far
from
grant
that
the
number
of
woman
be
so
great
,
or
the
number
of
man
so
small
;
but
if
they
will
have
me
tell
the
truth
,
the
disadvantage
of
the
woman
be
a
terrible
scandal
upon
the
man
,
and
it
lie
here
,
and
here
only
;
namely
,
that
the
age
be
so
wicked
,
and
the
sex
so
debauch
,
that
,
in
short
,
the
number
of
such
man
as
an
honest
woman
ought
to
meddle
with
<EOS>
be
small
indeed
,
and
it
be
but
here
and
there
that
a
man
be
to
be
find
who
be
fit
for
a
woman
to
venture
upon
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
consequence
even
of
that
too
amount
to
no
more
than
this
,
that
woman
ought
to
be
the
more
nice
<EOS>
;
for
how
do
we
know
the
just
character
of
the
man
that
make
the
offer
?
<EOS>
to
say
that
the
woman
should
be
the
more
easy
on
this
occasion
,
be
to
say
we
should
be
the
forwarder
to
venture
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
danger
,
which
,
in
my
way
of
reasoning
,
be
very
absurd
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
the
woman
have
ten
thousand
time
the
more
reason
to
be
wary
and
backward
,
by
how
much
the
hazard
of
be
betray
be
the
great
;
and
would
the
lady
consider
this
,
and
act
the
wary
part
,
they
would
discover
every
cheat
that
offer
;
for
,
in
short
,
the
life
of
very
few
man
nowadays
will
bear
a
character
;
and
if
the
lady
do
but
make
a
little
inquiry
,
they
will
soon
be
able
to
distinguish
the
man
and
deliver
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
woman
that
do
not
think
their
own
safety
worth
their
thought
,
that
,
impatient
of
their
perfect
state
,
resolve
,
as
they
call
it
,
to
take
the
first
good
Christian
that
come
,
that
run
into
matrimony
as
a
horse
rush
into
the
battle
,
I
can
say
nothing
to
them
but
this
,
that
they
be
a
sort
of
lady
that
be
to
be
pray
for
among
the
rest
of
distemper
people
,
and
to
me
they
look
like
people
that
venture
their
whole
estate
in
a
lottery
where
there
be
a
hundred
thousand
blank
to
one
prize
.
  
<EOS>
no
man
of
common
-
sense
will
value
a
woman
the
less
for
not
give
up
herself
at
the
first
attack
,
or
for
accept
his
proposal
without
inquire
into
his
person
or
character
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
must
think
her
the
weak
of
all
creature
in
the
world
,
as
the
rate
of
man
now
go
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
must
have
a
very
contemptible
opinion
of
her
capacity
,
nay
,
every
of
her
understanding
,
that
,
have
but
one
case
of
her
life
,
shall
call
that
life
away
at
once
,
and
make
matrimony
,
like
death
,
be
a
leap
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
the
conduct
of
my
sex
a
little
regulated
in
this
particular
,
which
be
the
thing
in
which
,
of
all
the
part
of
life
,
I
think
at
this
time
we
suffer
most
in
;
'
tis
nothing
but
lack
of
courage
,
the
fear
of
not
be
marry
at
all
,
and
of
that
frightful
state
of
life
call
an
old
maid
,
of
which
I
have
a
story
to
tell
by
itself
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
be
the
woman
's
snare
;
but
would
the
lady
once
but
get
above
that
fear
and
manage
rightly
,
they
would
more
certainly
avoid
it
by
stand
their
ground
,
in
a
case
so
absolutely
necessary
to
their
felicity
,
that
by
expose
themselves
as
they
do
;
and
if
they
do
not
marry
so
soon
as
they
may
do
otherwise
,
they
would
make
themselves
amend
by
marry
safe
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
always
married
too
soon
who
get
a
bad
husband
,
and
she
be
never
marry
too
late
who
get
a
good
one
;
in
a
word
,
there
be
no
woman
,
deformity
or
lose
reputation
except
,
but
if
she
manage
well
,
may
be
marry
safely
one
time
or
other
;
but
if
she
precipitate
herself
,
it
be
ten
thousand
to
one
<EOS>
but
she
be
undone
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
come
now
to
my
own
case
,
in
which
there
be
at
this
time
no
little
nicety
.
 
<EOS>
the
circumstance
I
be
in
make
the
offer
of
a
good
husband
the
most
necessary
thing
in
the
world
to
me
,
but
I
find
soon
that
to
be
make
cheap
and
easy
be
not
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
begin
to
be
find
that
the
widow
have
no
fortune
,
and
to
say
this
be
to
say
all
that
be
ill
of
me
,
for
I
begin
to
be
drop
in
all
the
discourse
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
be
well
-
breed
,
handsome
,
witty
,
modest
,
and
agreeable
;
all
which
I
have
allow
to
my
character
 
whether
justly
or
no
be
not
the
purpose
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
all
these
would
not
do
without
the
dross
,
which
way
now
become
more
valuable
than
virtue
itself
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
widow
,
they
say
,
have
no
money
.
  
<EOS>
I
resolve
,
therefore
,
as
to
the
state
of
my
present
circumstance
,
that
it
be
absolutely
necessary
to
change
my
station
,
and
make
a
new
appearance
in
some
other
place
where
I
be
not
know
,
and
even
to
pass
by
another
name
if
I
find
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
communicate
my
thought
to
my
intimate
friend
,
the
captain
's
lady
,
whom
I
have
so
faithfully
serve
in
her
case
with
the
captain
,
and
who
be
as
ready
to
serve
me
in
the
same
kind
as
I
could
desire
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
scruple
to
lay
my
circumstance
open
to
her
;
my
stock
be
but
low
,
for
I
have
make
but
about
#
#
#
#
540
at
the
close
of
my
last
affair
,
and
I
have
waste
some
of
that
;
however
,
I
have
about
#
#
#
#
460
leave
,
a
great
many
very
rich
clothe
,
a
gold
watch
,
and
some
jewel
,
though
of
no
extraordinary
value
,
and
about
#
#
#
#
30
or
#
#
#
#
40
leave
in
linen
<EOS>
not
dispose
of
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
and
faithful
friend
,
the
captain
's
wife
,
be
so
sensible
of
the
service
I
have
do
her
in
the
affair
above
,
that
she
be
not
only
a
steady
friend
to
me
,
but
,
know
my
circumstance
,
she
frequently
make
me
present
as
money
come
into
her
hand
,
such
as
fully
amount
to
a
maintenance
,
so
that
I
spend
none
of
my
own
;
and
at
last
she
make
this
unhappy
proposal
to
me
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
as
we
have
observe
,
as
above
,
how
the
man
make
no
scruple
to
set
themselves
out
as
person
merit
a
woman
of
fortune
,
when
they
have
really
no
fortune
of
their
own
,
it
be
but
just
to
deal
with
them
in
their
own
way
<EOS>
and
,
if
it
be
possible
,
to
deceive
the
deceiver
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
's
lady
,
in
short
,
put
this
project
into
my
head
,
and
tell
me
if
I
would
be
rule
by
her
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
get
a
husband
of
fortune
,
without
leave
him
any
room
to
reproach
me
with
want
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
as
I
have
reason
to
do
,
that
I
would
give
up
myself
wholly
to
her
direction
,
and
that
I
would
have
neither
tongue
to
speak
nor
foot
to
step
in
that
affair
<EOS>
but
as
she
should
direct
me
,
depend
that
she
would
extricate
me
out
of
every
difficulty
she
bring
me
into
,
which
she
say
she
would
answer
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
step
she
put
me
upon
be
to
call
her
cousin
,
and
to
to
a
relation
's
house
of
hers
in
the
country
,
where
she
direct
me
,
and
where
she
bring
her
husband
to
visit
me
;
and
call
me
cousin
,
she
work
matter
so
about
,
that
her
husband
and
she
together
invite
me
most
passionately
to
come
to
town
and
be
with
them
,
for
they
now
live
in
a
quite
different
place
from
where
they
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
she
tell
her
husband
that
I
have
at
least
#
#
#
#
1500
fortune
,
and
that
after
some
of
my
relation
I
be
like
to
have
a
great
deal
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
tell
her
husband
this
;
there
need
nothing
on
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
but
to
sit
still
and
wait
the
event
,
for
it
presently
go
all
over
the
neighbourhood
that
the
young
widow
at
Captain
#
#
#
#
'
s
be
a
fortune
,
that
she
have
at
least
#
#
#
#
1500
,
and
perhaps
a
great
deal
more
,
and
that
the
captain
say
so
;
and
if
the
captain
be
ask
at
any
time
about
me
,
he
make
no
scruple
to
affirm
it
,
though
he
know
not
one
word
of
the
matter
,
<EOS>
other
 
than
that
his
wife
have
tell
him
so
;
and
in
this
he
think
no
harm
,
for
he
really
believe
it
to
be
so
,
because
he
have
it
from
his
wife
:
 
so
slender
a
foundation
<EOS>
will
those
fellow
build
upon
,
if
they
do
but
think
there
be
a
fortune
in
the
game
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
reputation
of
this
fortune
,
I
presently
find
myself
bless
with
admirer
enough
,
and
that
I
have
my
choice
of
man
,
as
scarce
as
they
say
they
be
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
confirm
what
I
be
say
before
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
my
case
,
I
,
who
have
a
subtle
game
to
play
,
have
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
single
out
from
them
all
the
proper
man
that
may
be
for
my
purpose
;
that
be
to
say
,
the
man
who
be
most
likely
to
depend
upon
the
hearsay
of
a
fortune
,
and
not
inquire
too
far
into
the
particular
;
and
unless
I
do
this
I
do
nothing
,
for
my
case
would
not
bear
much
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
I
pick
out
my
man
without
much
difficulty
,
by
the
judgment
I
make
of
his
way
of
court
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
let
him
run
on
with
his
protestation
and
oath
that
he
love
me
above
all
the
world
;
that
if
I
would
make
him
happy
,
that
be
enough
;
all
which
I
know
be
upon
supposition
,
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
upon
a
full
satisfaction
,
that
I
be
very
rich
,
though
I
never
tell
him
a
word
of
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
my
man
;
but
I
be
to
try
him
to
the
bottom
,
and
indeed
in
that
consist
my
safety
;
for
if
he
baulk
,
I
know
I
be
undo
,
as
surely
as
he
be
undo
if
he
take
me
;
and
if
I
do
not
make
some
scruple
about
his
fortune
,
it
be
the
way
to
lead
him
to
raise
some
about
mine
;
and
first
,
therefore
,
I
pretend
on
all
occasion
to
doubt
his
sincerity
,
and
tell
him
,
perhaps
he
only
court
me
for
my
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
my
mouth
in
that
part
with
the
thunder
of
his
protestation
,
as
above
,
 
<EOS>
but
still
I
pretend
to
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
he
pull
off
his
diamond
ring
,
and
write
upon
the
glass
of
the
sash
in
my
chamber
this
line
      
<EOS>
"
You
I
love
,
and
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
read
it
,
and
ask
him
to
lend
me
his
ring
,
with
which
I
write
under
it
,
thus
       
"
<EOS>
and
so
in
love
say
every
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
his
ring
again
,
and
write
another
line
thus
        
"
Virtue
alone
be
an
estate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
borrow
it
again
,
and
I
write
under
it
        
"
<EOS>
but
money
's
virtue
,
gold
be
fate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
colour
as
red
as
fire
to
see
me
turn
so
quick
upon
him
,
and
in
a
kind
of
a
rage
tell
me
he
would
conquer
me
,
and
write
again
thus
        
"
I
scorn
your
gold
,
and
yet
I
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
venture
all
upon
the
last
cast
of
poetry
,
as
you
will
see
,
for
I
write
boldly
under
his
last
        
<EOS>
"
I
be
poor
:
 
<EOS>
let
's
see
how
kind
you
will
prove
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
sad
truth
to
me
;
whether
he
believe
me
or
no
,
I
could
not
tell
;
I
suppose
then
that
he
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
fly
to
me
,
take
me
in
his
arm
,
and
,
kiss
me
very
eagerly
,
and
with
the
great
passion
imaginable
,
he
hold
me
fast
till
he
call
for
a
pen
and
ink
,
and
then
tell
me
he
could
not
wait
the
tedious
writing
on
the
glass
,
but
,
pull
out
a
piece
of
paper
,
he
begin
and
write
again
        
"
be
mine
,
with
all
your
poverty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
take
his
pen
,
and
follow
him
immediately
,
thus
        
<EOS>
"
yet
secretly
you
hope
I
lie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
be
unkind
,
because
it
be
not
just
,
and
that
I
put
him
upon
contradict
me
,
which
do
not
consist
with
good
manner
,
any
more
than
with
his
affection
;
and
therefore
,
since
I
have
insensibly
draw
him
into
this
poetical
scribble
,
he
beg
I
would
not
oblige
him
to
break
it
off
;
so
he
write
again
        
"
let
love
alone
be
our
debate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
write
again
        
"
She
love
enough
that
do
not
hate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
he
take
for
a
favour
,
and
so
lay
down
the
cudgel
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
pen
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
he
take
if
for
a
favour
,
and
a
mighty
one
it
be
,
if
he
have
know
all
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
take
it
as
I
mean
it
,
that
is
,
to
let
him
think
I
be
inclined
to
go
on
with
him
,
as
indeed
I
have
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
do
,
for
he
be
the
best
-
humour
,
merry
sort
of
a
fellow
that
I
ever
meet
with
,
and
I
often
reflect
on
myself
how
doubly
criminal
it
be
to
deceive
such
a
man
;
but
that
necessity
,
which
press
me
to
a
settlement
suitable
to
my
condition
,
be
my
authority
for
it
;
and
certainly
his
affection
to
me
,
and
the
goodness
of
his
temper
,
however
they
may
argue
against
use
him
ill
,
yet
they
strongly
argue
to
me
that
he
would
better
take
the
disappointment
than
some
fiery
-
tempered
wretch
,
who
may
have
nothing
to
recommend
him
but
those
passion
which
would
serve
only
to
make
a
woman
miserable
all
her
day
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
though
I
jest
with
him
(
as
he
suppose
it
)
<EOS>
so
often
about
my
poverty
,
yet
,
when
he
find
it
to
be
true
,
he
have
foreclose
all
manner
of
objection
,
see
,
whether
he
be
in
jest
or
in
earnest
<EOS>
,
he
have
declare
he
take
me
without
any
regard
to
my
portion
,
and
,
whether
I
be
in
jest
or
in
earnest
,
I
have
declare
myself
to
be
very
poor
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
I
have
him
fast
both
way
;
and
though
he
may
say
afterwards
he
be
cheat
,
yet
he
could
never
say
that
I
have
cheat
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
pursue
me
close
after
this
,
and
as
I
see
there
be
no
need
to
fear
lose
him
,
I
play
the
indifferent
part
with
him
longer
than
prudence
may
otherwise
have
dictate
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
consider
how
much
this
caution
and
indifference
would
give
me
the
advantage
over
him
,
when
I
should
come
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
own
my
own
circumstance
to
him
;
and
I
manage
it
the
more
warily
,
because
I
find
he
infer
from
thence
,
as
indeed
he
ought
to
do
,
that
I
either
have
the
more
money
or
the
more
judgment
,
and
would
not
venture
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
the
freedom
one
day
,
after
we
have
talk
pretty
close
to
the
subject
,
to
tell
him
that
it
be
true
I
have
receive
the
compliment
of
a
lover
from
him
,
namely
,
that
he
would
take
me
without
inquire
into
my
fortune
,
and
I
would
make
him
a
suitable
return
in
this
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
I
would
make
as
little
inquiry
into
his
as
consist
with
reason
,
but
I
hope
he
would
allow
me
to
ask
a
few
question
,
which
he
would
answer
or
not
as
he
think
fit
;
and
that
I
would
not
be
offend
if
he
do
not
answer
me
at
all
;
one
of
these
question
relate
to
our
manner
of
living
,
and
the
place
<EOS>
where
,
because
I
have
hear
he
have
a
great
plantation
in
Virginia
,
and
that
he
have
talk
of
go
to
live
there
,
and
I
tell
him
I
do
not
care
to
be
transport
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
from
this
discourse
to
let
me
voluntarily
into
all
his
affair
,
and
to
tell
me
in
a
frank
,
open
way
all
his
circumstance
,
by
which
I
find
he
be
very
well
to
pass
in
the
world
;
but
that
great
part
of
his
estate
consist
of
three
plantation
,
which
he
have
in
Virginia
,
which
bring
him
in
a
very
good
income
,
generally
speak
,
to
the
tune
of
#
#
#
#
300
,
a
year
,
but
that
if
he
be
to
live
upon
them
,
would
bring
him
in
four
time
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
think
I
;
"
you
shall
carry
me
thither
as
soon
as
you
please
,
though
I
will
not
tell
you
so
beforehand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
jest
with
him
extremely
about
the
figure
he
would
make
in
Virginia
;
but
I
find
he
would
do
anything
I
desire
,
though
he
do
not
seem
glad
to
have
me
undervalue
his
plantation
,
so
I
turn
my
tale
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
have
good
reason
not
to
go
there
to
live
,
because
if
his
plantation
be
worth
so
much
there
,
I
have
not
a
fortune
suitable
to
a
gentleman
of
#
#
#
#
1200
a
year
,
as
he
say
his
estate
would
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
reply
generously
,
he
do
not
ask
what
my
fortune
be
;
he
have
tell
me
from
the
beginning
he
would
not
,
and
he
would
be
as
good
as
his
word
;
but
whatever
it
be
,
he
assure
me
he
would
never
desire
me
to
go
to
Virginia
with
him
,
or
go
thither
himself
without
me
,
unless
I
be
perfectly
willing
,
and
make
it
my
choice
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
,
you
may
be
sure
<EOS>
,
be
as
I
wish
,
and
indeed
nothing
could
have
happen
more
perfectly
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
carry
it
on
as
far
as
this
with
a
sort
of
indifferency
that
he
often
wonder
at
,
more
than
at
first
,
but
which
be
the
only
support
of
his
courtship
;
and
I
mention
it
the
rather
to
intimate
again
to
the
lady
that
nothing
but
want
of
courage
for
such
an
indifferency
make
our
sex
so
cheap
,
and
prepare
them
to
be
ill
-
use
as
they
be
;
would
they
venture
the
loss
of
a
pretending
fop
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
who
carry
it
high
upon
the
point
of
his
own
merit
,
they
would
certainly
be
less
slighted
,
and
court
more
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
discover
really
and
truly
what
my
great
fortune
be
,
and
that
in
all
I
have
not
full
#
#
#
#
500
when
he
expect
#
#
#
#
1500
,
<EOS>
yet
I
have
hook
him
so
fast
,
and
play
him
so
long
,
that
I
be
satisfied
he
would
have
have
me
in
my
bad
circumstance
;
and
indeed
it
be
less
a
surprise
to
him
when
he
learn
the
truth
than
it
would
have
be
,
because
have
not
the
least
blame
to
lay
on
me
,
who
have
carry
it
with
an
air
of
indifference
to
the
last
,
he
would
not
say
one
word
,
except
that
indeed
he
think
it
have
be
more
,
but
that
if
it
have
be
less
he
do
not
repent
his
bargain
;
only
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
maintain
me
so
well
as
he
intend
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
be
married
,
and
very
happily
married
on
my
side
,
I
assure
you
,
as
to
the
man
;
for
he
be
the
best
-
humoured
man
that
every
woman
have
,
but
his
circumstance
be
not
so
good
as
I
imagine
,
as
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
have
not
better
himself
by
marry
so
much
as
he
expect
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
married
,
I
be
shrewdly
put
to
it
to
bring
him
that
little
stock
I
have
,
and
to
let
him
see
it
be
no
more
;
but
there
be
a
necessity
for
it
,
so
<EOS>
I
take
my
opportunity
one
day
when
we
be
alone
,
to
enter
into
a
short
dialogue
with
him
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
we
have
be
marry
a
fortnight
;
be
it
not
time
to
let
you
know
whether
you
have
get
a
wife
with
something
or
with
nothing
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
own
time
for
that
<EOS>
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
be
satisfied
that
I
have
get
the
wife
I
love
;
I
have
not
trouble
you
much
,
"
say
he
,
"
with
my
inquiry
after
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
I
have
a
great
difficulty
upon
me
about
it
,
which
I
scarce
know
how
to
manage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
,
m
dear
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
'
tis
a
little
hard
upon
me
,
and
'
tis
harder
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
Captain
#
#
#
#
"
 
<EOS>
(
mean
my
friend
's
husband
)
"
have
tell
you
I
have
a
great
deal
more
money
than
I
ever
pretend
to
have
,
and
I
be
sure
I
never
employ
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
captain
#
#
#
#
 
may
have
tell
me
so
,
but
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
not
so
much
,
that
may
lie
at
his
door
,
but
you
never
tell
me
what
you
have
,
so
I
have
no
reason
to
blame
you
if
you
have
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
be
so
just
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
so
generous
,
that
it
make
my
having
but
a
little
a
double
affliction
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
less
you
have
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
bad
for
us
both
;
but
I
hope
your
affliction
you
speak
of
be
not
cause
for
fear
I
should
be
unkind
to
you
,
for
want
of
a
portion
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
if
you
have
nothing
,
tell
me
plainly
,
and
at
once
;
I
may
perhaps
tell
the
captain
he
have
cheat
me
,
but
I
can
never
say
you
have
cheat
me
,
for
do
you
not
give
it
under
your
hand
that
you
be
poor
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
ought
to
expect
you
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
be
glad
I
have
not
be
concern
in
deceive
you
before
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
deceive
you
since
,
'
tis
ne'er
the
bad
;
that
I
be
poor
be
too
true
,
but
not
so
poor
as
to
have
nothing
neither
"
;
so
I
pull
out
some
bank
bill
,
and
give
him
about
#
#
#
#
160
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
not
quite
all
neither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
bring
him
so
near
to
expect
nothing
,
by
what
I
have
say
before
,
that
the
money
,
though
the
sum
be
small
in
itself
,
be
doubly
welcome
to
him
;
he
own
it
be
more
than
he
look
for
,
and
that
he
do
not
question
by
my
discourse
to
him
,
but
that
my
fine
clothe
,
gold
watch
,
and
a
diamond
ring
or
two
,
have
be
all
my
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
I
let
him
please
himself
with
that
#
#
#
#
160
two
or
three
day
,
and
then
,
have
be
abroad
that
day
,
and
as
if
I
have
 
be
to
fetch
it
,
I
bring
him
#
#
#
#
100
more
home
in
gold
,
and
tell
him
there
be
a
little
more
portion
for
him
;
and
,
<EOS>
in
short
,
in
about
a
week
more
I
bring
him
#
#
#
#
180
more
,
and
about
#
#
#
#
60
in
linen
,
which
I
make
him
believe
I
have
be
oblige
to
take
with
the
#
#
#
#
100
which
I
give
him
in
gold
,
as
a
composition
for
a
debt
of
#
#
#
#
600
,
be
little
more
than
five
shilling
in
the
pound
,
and
overvalue
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
to
tell
you
,
that
there
be
all
,
and
that
I
have
give
you
my
whole
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
I
add
,
that
if
the
person
who
have
my
#
#
#
#
600
have
not
abuse
me
,
I
have
be
worth
#
#
#
#
1000
to
him
,
but
that
as
it
be
,
I
have
be
faithful
to
him
,
and
reserve
nothing
to
myself
,
but
if
it
have
be
more
he
should
have
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
oblige
by
the
manner
,
and
so
pleased
with
the
sum
,
for
he
have
be
in
a
terrible
fright
lest
it
have
be
nothing
at
all
<EOS>
,
that
he
accept
it
very
thankfully
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
I
get
over
the
fraud
of
pass
for
a
fortune
without
money
,
and
cheat
a
man
into
marry
me
on
pretence
of
a
fortune
;
<EOS>
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
take
to
be
one
of
the
most
dangerous
step
a
woman
can
take
,
and
in
which
she
run
the
most
hazard
of
be
ill
-
use
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
My
husband
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
be
a
man
of
infinite
good
nature
,
but
he
be
no
fool
;
and
find
his
income
not
suit
to
the
manner
of
living
which
he
have
intend
,
if
I
have
bring
him
what
he
expect
,
and
be
under
a
disappointment
in
his
return
of
his
plantation
in
Virginia
,
he
discover
many
time
his
inclination
of
go
over
to
Virginia
,
to
live
upon
his
own
;
and
often
would
be
magnify
the
way
of
live
there
,
how
cheap
,
how
plentiful
,
how
pleasant
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
presently
to
understand
this
meaning
,
and
I
take
him
up
very
plainly
one
morning
,
and
tell
him
that
I
do
so
;
that
I
find
his
estate
turn
to
no
account
at
this
distance
,
compare
to
what
it
would
do
if
he
live
upon
the
spot
,
and
that
I
find
he
have
a
mind
to
go
and
live
there
;
and
I
add
,
that
I
be
sensible
he
have
be
disappoint
in
a
wife
,
and
that
find
his
expectation
not
answer
that
way
<EOS>
,
I
could
do
no
less
,
to
make
him
amend
,
than
tell
him
that
I
be
very
willing
to
go
over
to
Virginia
with
him
and
live
there
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
a
thousand
kind
thing
to
me
upon
the
subject
of
my
make
such
a
proposal
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
that
however
he
be
disappointed
in
his
expectation
of
a
fortune
,
he
be
not
disappoint
in
a
wife
,
and
that
I
be
all
to
him
that
a
wife
could
be
,
and
he
be
more
than
satisfied
on
the
whole
when
the
particular
be
put
together
,
but
that
this
offer
be
so
kind
,
that
it
be
more
than
he
could
express
.
  
<EOS>
to
bring
the
story
short
,
we
agree
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
he
have
a
very
good
house
there
,
that
it
be
well
furnished
,
that
his
mother
be
alive
and
live
in
it
,
and
one
sister
,
which
be
all
the
relation
he
have
;
that
as
soon
as
he
come
there
,
his
mother
would
remove
to
another
house
,
which
be
her
own
for
life
,
and
his
after
her
decease
;
so
that
I
should
have
all
the
house
to
myself
;
and
I
find
all
this
to
be
exactly
as
he
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
to
make
this
part
of
the
story
short
,
we
put
on
board
the
ship
which
we
go
in
,
a
large
quantity
of
good
furniture
for
our
house
,
with
store
of
linen
and
other
necessary
,
and
a
good
cargo
for
sale
,
and
away
we
go
.
  
<EOS>
to
give
an
account
of
the
manner
of
our
voyage
,
which
be
long
and
full
of
danger
,
be
out
of
my
way
;
I
keep
no
journal
,
neither
do
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
I
can
say
be
,
that
after
a
terrible
passage
,
fright
twice
with
dreadful
storm
,
and
once
with
what
be
still
more
terrible
,
I
mean
a
pirate
who
come
on
board
and
take
away
almost
all
our
provision
;
and
which
would
have
be
beyond
all
to
me
,
they
have
once
take
my
husband
to
go
along
with
them
,
but
by
entreaty
be
prevail
with
to
leave
him
;
 
I
say
,
after
all
these
terrible
thing
,
we
arrive
in
York
River
in
Virginia
,
and
come
to
our
plantation
,
we
be
receive
with
all
the
demonstration
of
tenderness
and
affection
,
by
my
husband
's
mother
,
that
be
possible
to
be
express
.
  
<EOS>
We
live
here
all
together
,
my
mother
-
in
-
law
,
at
my
entreaty
,
continue
in
the
house
,
for
she
be
too
kind
a
mother
to
be
part
with
;
my
husband
likewise
continue
the
same
as
at
first
,
and
I
think
myself
the
happy
creature
alive
,
when
an
odd
and
surprising
event
put
an
end
to
all
that
felicity
in
a
moment
,
and
render
my
condition
the
most
uncomfortable
,
if
not
the
most
miserable
,
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
be
a
mighty
cheerful
,
good
-
humoured
old
woman
  
<EOS>
I
 
may
call
her
old
woman
,
for
her
son
be
above
thirty
;
I
say
she
be
very
pleasant
,
good
company
,
and
use
to
entertain
me
,
in
particular
,
with
abundance
of
story
to
divert
me
,
as
well
of
 
the
country
we
be
in
as
of
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
she
often
tell
me
how
the
great
part
of
the
inhabitant
of
the
colony
come
thither
in
very
indifferent
circumstance
from
England
;
that
,
generally
speak
,
they
be
of
two
sort
;
either
,
first
,
such
as
be
bring
over
by
master
of
ship
to
be
sell
as
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
such
as
we
call
them
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
but
they
be
more
properly
call
slave
.
<EOS>
"
or
,
secondly
,
such
as
be
transport
from
Newgate
and
other
prison
,
after
have
be
find
guilty
of
felony
and
other
crime
punishable
with
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
they
come
here
,
"
say
she
,
"
we
make
no
difference
;
the
planter
buy
them
,
and
they
work
together
in
the
field
till
their
time
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
when
'
tis
expire
,
"
say
she
,
"
they
have
encouragement
give
them
to
plant
for
themselves
;
for
they
have
a
certain
number
of
acre
of
land
allot
them
by
the
country
,
and
they
go
to
work
to
clear
and
cure
the
land
,
and
then
to
plant
it
with
tobacco
and
corn
for
their
own
use
;
and
as
the
tradesman
and
merchant
will
trust
them
with
tool
and
clothe
and
other
necessary
,
upon
the
credit
of
their
crop
before
it
be
grow
,
so
they
again
plant
every
year
a
little
more
than
the
year
before
,
and
so
buy
whatever
they
want
with
the
crop
that
be
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
hence
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
man
a
Newgate

a

she

<EOS>
She
be
go
on
with
that
part
of
the
story
,
when
her
own
part
in
it
interrupt
her
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
good
-
humoured
confidence
she
tell
me
she
be
one
of
the
second
sort
of
inhabitant
herself

that
she

away
openly
,
have
venture
too
far
in
a
particular
case

so
that
she
be
become
a
criminal

<EOS>
and
here
be
the
mark
of
it

she
;

,
pull
off
her
glove
,
"
look

say
she
,
turn
up
the
palm
of
her

me
a
very
fine

in

<EOS>
We
have
frequent
discourse
of
this
kind
,
and
abundance
of
instance
she
give
me
of
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
time
,
as
she
be
tell
some
story
of
one
that
be
transport
but
a
few
week
ago
,
I
begin
in
an
intimate
kind
of
way
to
ask
her
to
tell
me
something
of
her
own
story
,
which
she
do
with
the
utmost
plainness
and
sincerity
;
how
she
have
fall
into
very
ill
company
in
London
in
her
young
day
,
occasion
by
her
mother
send
her
frequently
to
carry
victual
and
other
relief
to
a
kinswoman
of
her
who
be
a
prisoner
in
Newgate
,
and
who
lie
in
a
miserable
starving
condition
,
be
afterwards
condemn
to
be
hang
,
but
have
get
respite
by
plead
her
belly
,
die
afterwards
in
the
prison
.
  
<EOS>
here
my
mother
-
in
-
law
run
out
in
a
long
account
of
the
wicked
practice
in
that
dreadful
place
,
and
how
it
ruin
more
young
people
that
all
the
town
besides
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
child
,
"
say
my
mother
,
"
perhaps
you
may
know
little
of
it
,
or
,
it
may
be
,
have
hear
nothing
about
it
;
but
depend
upon
it
,
"
say
she
,
<EOS>
"
we
all
know
here
that
there
be
more
thief
and
rogue
make
by
that
one
prison
of
Newgate
than
by
all
the
club
and
society
of
villain
in
the
nation
;
'
tis
that
curse
place
,
"
say
my
mother
,
"
that
half
people
this
colony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
she
go
on
with
her
own
story
so
long
,
and
in
so
particular
a
manner
,
that
I
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
;
but
come
to
one
particular
that
require
tell
her
name
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
should
have
sink
down
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
She
perceive
<EOS>
I
be
out
of
order
,
and
ask
me
if
I
be
not
well
,
and
what
ail
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
be
so
affected
with
the
melancholy
story
she
have
tell
,
and
the
terrible
thing
she
have
go
through
,
that
it
have
overcome
me
,
and
I
beg
of
her
to
talk
no
more
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
very
kindly
,
"
what
need
these
thing
trouble
you
?
 
<EOS>
these
passage
be
long
before
your
time
,
and
they
give
me
no
trouble
at
all
now
;
nay
,
I
look
back
on
them
with
a
particular
satisfaction
,
as
they
have
be
a
means
to
bring
me
to
this
place
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
she
go
on
to
tell
me
how
she
very
luckily
fall
into
a
good
family
,
where
,
behave
herself
well
,
and
her
mistress
die
,
her
master
marry
her
,
by
whom
she
have
my
husband
and
his
sister
,
and
that
by
her
diligence
and
good
management
after
her
husband
's
death
,
she
have
improve
the
plantation
to
such
a
degree
as
they
then
be
,
so
that
most
of
the
estate
be
of
her
get
,
not
her
husband
's
,
for
she
have
be
a
widow
upwards
of
sixteen
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
this
part
of
they
story
with
very
little
attention
,
because
I
want
much
to
retire
and
give
vent
to
my
passion
,
which
I
do
soon
after
;
and
let
any
one
judge
what
must
be
the
anguish
of
my
mind
,
when
I
come
to
reflect
that
this
be
certainly
no
more
or
less
than
my
own
mother
,
and
I
have
now
have
two
child
,
and
be
big
with
another
by
my
own
brother
,
and
lie
with
him
still
every
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
the
most
unhappy
of
all
woman
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
have
the
story
never
be
tell
me
,
all
have
be
well
;
it
have
be
no
crime
to
have
lain
with
my
husband
,
since
as
to
his
be
my
relation
I
have
know
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
such
a
load
on
my
mind
that
it
keep
me
perpetually
wake
;
to
reveal
it
,
which
would
have
be
some
ease
to
me
,
I
could
not
find
would
be
to
any
purpose
,
and
yet
to
conceal
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
;
nay
,
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
should
talk
of
it
in
my
sleep
,
and
tell
my
husband
of
it
whether
I
would
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
discover
it
,
the
least
thing
I
could
expect
be
to
lose
my
husband
,
for
he
be
too
nice
and
too
honest
a
man
to
have
continue
my
husband
after
he
have
know
I
have
be
his
sister
;
so
that
I
be
perplex
to
the
last
degree
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
any
man
to
judge
what
difficulty
present
to
my
view
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
away
from
my
native
country
,
at
a
distance
prodigious
,
and
the
return
to
me
unpassable
.
 
<EOS>
I
live
very
well
,
but
in
a
circumstance
insufferable
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
discover
myself
to
my
mother
,
it
may
be
difficult
to
convince
her
of
the
particular
,
and
I
have
no
way
to
prove
them
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
if
she
have
question
or
doubt
me
,
I
have
be
undo
,
for
the
bare
suggestion
would
have
immediately
separate
me
from
my
husband
,
without
gain
my
mother
or
him
,
who
would
have
be
neither
a
husband
nor
a
brother
;
so
that
between
the
surprise
on
one
hand
,
and
the
uncertainty
on
the
other
,
I
have
be
sure
to
be
undo
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
as
I
be
but
too
sure
of
the
fact
,
I
live
therefore
in
open
avow
incest
and
whoredom
,
and
all
under
the
appearance
of
an
honest
wife
;
and
though
I
be
not
much
touch
with
the
crime
of
it
,
yet
the
action
have
something
in
it
shocking
to
nature
,
and
make
my
husband
,
as
he
think
himself
,
even
nauseous
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
upon
the
most
sedate
consideration
,
I
resolve
that
it
be
absolutely
necessary
to
conceal
it
all
and
not
make
the
least
discovery
of
it
either
to
mother
or
husband
;
and
thus
I
live
with
the
great
pressure
imaginable
for
three
year
more
,
but
have
no
more
child
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
time
my
mother
use
to
be
frequently
tell
me
old
story
of
her
former
adventure
,
which
,
however
,
be
no
way
pleasant
to
me
;
for
by
it
,
though
she
do
not
tell
it
me
in
plain
term
,
yet
I
could
easily
understand
,
join
with
what
I
have
hear
myself
,
of
my
first
tutor
,
that
in
her
young
day
she
have
be
both
whore
and
thief
;
but
I
verily
believe
she
have
live
to
repent
sincerely
of
both
,
and
that
she
be
then
a
very
pious
,
sober
,
and
religious
woman
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
let
her
life
have
be
what
it
would
then
,
it
be
certain
that
my
life
be
very
uneasy
to
me
;
for
I
live
,
as
I
have
say
,
but
in
the
bad
sort
of
whoredom
,
and
as
I
could
expect
no
good
of
it
,
so
really
no
good
issue
come
of
it
,
and
all
my
seeming
prosperity
wear
off
,
and
end
in
misery
and
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
,
indeed
,
before
it
come
to
this
,
for
,
but
I
know
not
by
what
ill
fate
guide
,
everything
go
wrong
with
us
afterwards
,
and
that
which
be
bad
,
my
husband
grow
strangely
alter
,
forward
,
jealous
,
and
unkind
,
and
I
be
as
impatient
of
bear
his
carriage
,
as
the
carriage
be
unreasonable
and
unjust
.
 
<EOS>
these
thing
proceed
so
far
,
that
we
come
at
last
to
be
in
such
ill
term
with
one
another
,
that
I
claim
a
promise
of
him
,
which
he
enter
willingly
into
with
me
when
I
consent
to
come
from
England
with
him
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
if
I
find
the
country
not
to
agree
with
me
,
or
that
I
do
not
like
to
live
there
,
I
should
come
away
to
England
again
when
I
please
,
give
him
a
year
's
warning
to
settle
his
affair
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
now
claim
this
promise
of
him
,
and
I
must
confess
I
do
it
not
in
the
most
obliging
term
that
could
be
in
the
world
neither
<EOS>
;
but
I
insist
that
he
treat
me
ill
,
that
I
be
remote
from
my
friend
,
and
could
do
myself
no
justice
,
and
that
he
be
jealous
without
cause
,
my
conversation
have
be
unblamable
,
and
he
have
no
pretense
for
it
,
and
that
to
remove
to
England
would
take
away
all
occasion
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
insist
so
peremptorily
upon
it
,
that
he
could
not
avoid
come
to
a
point
,
either
to
keep
his
word
with
me
or
to
break
it
;
and
this
,
notwithstanding
he
use
all
the
skill
he
be
master
of
,
and
employ
his
mother
and
other
agent
to
prevail
with
me
to
alter
my
resolution
;
indeed
,
the
bottom
of
the
thing
lie
at
my
heart
,
and
that
make
all
his
endeavour
fruitless
,
for
my
heart
be
alienate
from
him
as
a
husband
.
 
<EOS>
I
loathe
the
thought
of
bed
with
him
,
and
use
a
thousand
pretense
of
illness
and
humour
to
prevent
his
touch
me
,
fear
nothing
more
than
to
be
with
child
by
him
,
<EOS>
which
to
be
sure
would
have
prevent
,
or
at
least
delayed
,
my
go
over
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
I
put
him
so
out
of
humour
,
that
he
take
up
a
rash
and
fatal
resolution
;
in
short
,
I
should
not
go
to
England
;
and
though
he
have
promise
me
,
yet
it
be
an
unreasonable
thing
for
me
to
desire
it
;
that
it
would
be
ruinous
to
his
affair
,
would
unhinge
his
whole
family
,
and
be
next
to
an
undo
him
in
the
world
;
that
therefore
I
ought
not
to
desire
it
of
him
,
and
that
no
wife
in
the
world
that
value
her
family
and
her
husband
's
prosperity
would
insist
upon
such
a
thing
.
  
<EOS>
this
plunge
me
again
,
for
when
I
consider
the
thing
calmly
,
and
take
my
husband
as
he
really
be
,
a
diligent
,
careful
man
in
the
main
work
of
lay
up
an
estate
for
his
child
,
and
that
he
know
nothing
of
the
dreadful
circumstance
that
he
be
in
,
I
could
not
but
confess
to
myself
that
my
proposal
be
very
unreasonable
,
and
what
no
wife
that
have
the
good
of
her
family
at
heart
would
have
desire
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
discontent
be
of
another
nature
;
I
look
upon
him
no
longer
as
a
husband
,
but
as
a
near
relation
,
the
son
of
my
own
mother
,
and
I
resolve
somehow
or
other
to
be
clear
of
him
,
but
which
way
I
do
not
know
,
nor
do
it
seem
possible
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
say
by
the
ill
-
natured
world
,
of
our
sex
,
that
if
we
be
set
on
a
thing
,
it
be
impossible
to
turn
us
from
our
resolution
;
in
short
,
I
never
cease
pore
upon
the
mean
to
bring
to
pass
my
voyage
,
and
come
that
length
with
my
husband
at
last
,
as
to
propose
go
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
provoke
him
to
the
last
degree
,
and
he
call
me
not
only
an
unkind
wife
,
but
an
unnatural
mother
,
and
ask
me
how
I
could
entertain
such
a
thought
without
horror
,
as
that
of
leave
my
two
child
(
for
one
be
dead
)
without
a
mother
,
and
to
be
bring
up
by
stranger
,
and
never
to
see
them
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
have
thing
be
right
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
do
it
,
but
now
it
be
my
real
desire
never
to
see
them
,
or
him
either
,
any
more
;
and
as
to
the
charge
of
unnatural
,
I
could
easily
answer
it
to
myself
,
while
I
know
that
the
whole
relation
be
unnatural
in
the
high
degree
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
plain
<EOS>
there
be
no
bring
my
husband
to
anything
;
he
would
neither
go
with
me
nor
let
me
go
without
him
,
and
it
be
quite
out
of
my
power
to
stir
without
his
consent
,
as
any
one
that
know
the
constitution
of
the
country
I
be
in
,
know
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
many
family
quarrel
about
it
,
and
they
begin
in
time
to
grow
up
to
a
dangerous
height
;
for
as
I
be
quite
estranged
form
my
husband
(
as
he
be
call
)
in
affection
,
so
I
take
no
heed
to
my
word
,
but
sometimes
give
him
language
that
be
provoke
;
and
,
in
short
,
strove
all
I
could
to
bring
him
to
a
parting
with
me
,
which
be
what
above
all
thing
in
the
world
I
desire
most
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
my
carriage
very
ill
,
and
indeed
he
may
well
do
so
,
for
at
last
I
refuse
to
bed
with
him
,
and
carry
on
the
breach
upon
all
occasion
to
extremity
,
he
tell
me
once
he
think
I
be
mad
,
and
if
I
do
not
alter
my
conduct
,
he
would
put
me
under
cure
;
that
be
to
say
,
into
a
madhouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
should
find
I
be
far
enough
from
mad
,
and
that
it
be
not
in
his
power
,
or
any
other
villain
's
,
to
murder
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
at
the
same
time
I
be
heartily
fright
at
his
thought
of
put
me
into
a
madhouse
,
which
would
at
once
have
destroy
all
the
possibility
of
break
the
truth
out
,
whatever
the
occasion
may
be
;
for
that
then
no
one
would
have
give
credit
to
a
word
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
therefore
bring
me
to
a
resolution
,
whatever
come
of
it
,
to
lay
open
my
whole
case
;
but
which
way
to
do
it
,
or
to
whom
,
be
an
inextricable
difficulty
,
and
take
me
many
month
to
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
another
quarrel
with
my
husband
happen
,
which
come
up
to
such
a
mad
extreme
as
almost
push
me
on
to
tell
it
him
all
to
his
face
;
but
though
I
keep
it
in
so
as
not
to
come
to
the
particular
,
I
speak
so
much
as
put
him
into
the
utmost
confusion
,
and
in
the
end
bring
out
the
whole
story
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
with
a
calm
expostulation
upon
my
being
so
resolute
to
go
to
England
;
I
defend
it
,
and
one
hard
word
bring
on
another
,
as
be
usual
in
all
family
strife
,
he
tell
me
I
do
not
treat
him
as
if
he
be
my
husband
,
or
talk
of
my
child
as
if
I
be
a
mother
;
and
,
in
short
,
that
I
do
not
deserve
to
be
use
as
a
wife
;
that
he
have
use
all
the
fair
mean
possible
with
me
;
that
he
have
argue
with
all
the
kindness
and
calmness
that
a
husband
or
a
Christian
ought
to
do
,
and
that
I
make
him
such
a
vile
return
,
that
I
treat
him
rather
like
a
dog
than
a
man
,
and
rather
like
the
most
contemptible
stranger
than
a
husband
;
that
he
be
very
loth
to
use
violence
with
me
,
but
that
,
in
short
,
he
see
a
necessity
of
it
now
,
and
that
for
the
future
he
should
be
oblige
to
take
such
measure
as
should
reduce
me
to
my
duty
.
  
<EOS>
My
blood
be
now
fire
to
the
utmost
,
though
I
know
what
he
have
say
be
very
true
,
and
nothing
could
appear
more
provoke
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
for
his
fair
mean
and
his
foul
,
they
be
equally
contemn
by
me
;
that
for
my
going
to
England
,
I
be
resolve
on
it
,
come
what
would
;
and
that
as
to
treat
him
not
like
a
husband
,
and
not
show
myself
a
mother
to
my
child
,
there
may
be
something
more
in
it
than
he
understand
at
present
;
but
,
for
his
further
consideration
,
I
think
fit
to
tell
him
thus
much
,
that
he
neither
be
my
lawful
husband
,
nor
they
lawful
child
,
and
that
I
have
reason
to
regard
neither
of
them
more
than
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
move
to
pity
him
when
I
speak
it
,
for
he
turn
pale
as
death
,
and
stand
mute
as
one
thunderstruck
,
and
once
or
twice
I
think
he
would
have
faint
;
in
short
,
it
put
him
in
a
fit
something
like
an
apoplex
<EOS>
;
he
tremble
,
a
sweat
or
dew
run
off
his
face
,
and
yet
he
be
cold
as
a
clod
,
so
that
I
be
force
to
run
and
fetch
something
for
him
to
keep
life
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
recover
of
that
,
he
grow
sick
and
vomit
,
and
in
a
little
after
be
put
to
bed
,
and
the
next
morning
be
,
as
he
have
be
indeed
all
night
,
in
a
violent
fever
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
go
off
again
,
and
he
recover
,
though
but
slowly
,
and
when
he
come
to
be
a
little
well
,
he
tell
me
I
have
give
him
a
mortal
wound
with
my
tongue
,
and
he
have
only
one
thing
to
ask
before
he
desire
an
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
I
interrupt
him
,
and
tell
him
I
be
sorry
I
have
go
so
far
,
since
I
see
what
disorder
it
put
him
into
,
but
I
desire
him
not
to
talk
to
me
of
explanation
,
for
that
<EOS>
would
but
make
thing
bad
.
  
<EOS>
this
heighten
his
impatience
,
and
,
indeed
,
perplex
him
beyond
all
bearing
;
for
now
he
begin
to
suspect
that
there
be
some
mystery
yet
unfold
,
but
could
not
make
the
least
guess
at
the
real
particular
of
it
;
all
that
run
in
his
brain
be
,
that
I
have
another
husband
alive
,
which
I
could
not
say
in
fact
may
not
be
true
,
but
I
assure
him
,
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
not
the
least
of
that
in
it
;
and
indeed
,
as
to
my
other
husband
,
he
be
effectually
dead
in
law
to
me
,
and
have
tell
me
I
should
look
on
him
as
such
,
<EOS>
so
I
have
not
the
least
uneasiness
on
that
score
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
I
find
the
thing
too
far
go
to
conceal
it
much
longer
,
and
my
husband
himself
give
me
an
opportunity
to
ease
myself
of
the
secret
,
much
to
my
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
labour
with
me
three
or
four
week
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
only
to
tell
him
whether
I
have
speak
these
word
only
as
the
effect
of
my
passion
,
to
put
him
in
a
passion
,
or
whether
there
be
anything
of
 
truth
in
the
bottom
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
continue
inflexible
,
and
would
explain
nothing
,
unless
he
would
first
consent
to
my
going
to
England
,
which
he
would
never
do
,
he
say
,
while
he
live
;
on
the
other
hand
,
I
say
it
be
in
my
power
to
make
him
willing
when
I
please
 
nay
,
to
make
him
entreat
me
to
go
;
and
this
increase
his
curiosity
,
and
make
him
importunate
to
the
high
degree
,
but
it
be
all
to
no
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
he
tell
all
this
story
to
his
mother
,
and
set
her
upon
me
to
get
the
main
secret
out
of
me
,
and
she
use
her
utmost
skill
with
me
indeed
;
but
I
put
her
to
a
full
stop
at
once
by
tell
her
that
the
reason
and
mystery
of
the
whole
matter
lie
in
herself
,
and
that
it
be
my
respect
to
her
that
have
make
me
conceal
it
;
and
that
,
in
short
,
I
could
go
no
farther
,
and
therefore
conjure
her
not
to
insist
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
strike
dumb
at
this
suggestion
,
and
could
not
tell
what
to
say
or
to
think
;
but
,
lay
aside
the
supposition
as
a
policy
of
mine
,
continue
her
importunity
on
account
of
her
son
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
make
up
the
breach
between
us
two
.
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
I
tell
her
that
it
be
indeed
a
good
design
in
her
,
but
that
it
be
impossible
to
be
do
;
and
that
if
I
should
reveal
to
her
the
truth
of
what
she
desire
,
she
would
grant
it
to
be
impossible
,
and
cease
to
desire
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
seem
to
be
prevail
on
by
her
importunity
,
and
tell
her
I
dare
trust
her
with
a
secret
of
the
great
importance
,
and
she
would
soon
see
that
this
be
so
,
and
that
I
would
consent
to
lodge
it
in
her
breast
,
if
she
would
engage
solemnly
not
to
acquaint
her
son
with
it
without
my
consent
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
long
in
promise
this
part
,
but
rather
than
not
come
at
the
main
secret
,
she
agree
to
that
too
,
and
after
a
great
many
other
preliminary
,
I
begin
,
and
tell
her
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
first
I
tell
her
how
much
she
be
concern
in
all
the
unhappy
breach
which
have
happen
between
her
son
and
me
,
by
tell
me
her
own
story
and
her
London
name
;
and
that
the
surprise
she
see
I
be
in
be
upon
that
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
I
tell
her
my
own
story
,
and
my
name
,
and
assure
her
,
by
such
other
token
as
she
could
not
deny
,
that
I
be
no
other
,
nor
more
or
less
,
than
her
own
child
,
her
daughter
,
bear
of
her
body
in
Newgate
;
the
same
that
have
save
her
from
the
gallow
by
be
in
her
belly
,
and
the
same
that
she
leave
in
such
-
and
-
such
hand
when
she
be
transport
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
she
be
in
;
she
be
not
incline
to
believe
the
story
,
or
to
remember
the
particular
,
for
she
immediately
foresee
the
confusion
that
must
follow
in
the
family
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
everything
concur
so
exactly
with
the
story
she
have
tell
me
of
herself
,
and
which
,
if
she
have
not
tell
me
,
she
would
perhaps
have
be
content
to
have
deny
,
that
she
have
stop
her
own
mouth
,
and
she
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
me
about
the
neck
and
kiss
me
,
and
cry
most
vehemently
over
me
,
without
speak
one
word
for
a
long
time
together
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
break
out
:
 
"
unhappy
child
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
"
what
miserable
chance
could
bring
thee
hither
?
<EOS>
and
in
the
arm
of
my
own
son
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
dreadful
girl
,
"
say
she
,
"
why
,
we
be
all
undone
!
 
<EOS>
marry
to
thy
own
brother
!
 
<EOS>
three
child
,
and
two
alive
,
all
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
!
 
<EOS>
My
son
and
my
daughter
lie
together
as
husband
and
wife
!
 
<EOS>
all
confusion
and
distraction
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
miserable
family
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
us
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
say
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
thus
she
run
on
for
a
great
while
;
nor
have
I
any
power
to
speak
,
or
if
I
have
,
do
I
know
what
to
say
,
for
every
word
wound
me
to
the
soul
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
kind
of
amazement
on
our
thought
we
part
for
the
first
time
,
though
my
mother
be
more
surprised
than
I
be
,
because
it
be
more
news
to
her
than
to
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
promise
again
to
me
at
parting
,
that
she
would
say
nothing
of
it
to
her
son
,
till
we
have
talk
of
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
,
you
may
be
sure
,
before
we
have
a
second
conference
upon
the
same
subject
;
when
,
as
if
she
have
be
willing
to
forget
the
story
she
have
tell
me
of
herself
,
or
to
suppose
that
I
have
forget
some
of
the
particular
,
she
begin
to
tell
them
with
alteration
and
omission
;
but
I
refresh
her
memory
and
set
her
to
right
in
many
thing
which
I
suppose
she
have
forget
,
and
then
come
in
so
opportunely
with
the
whole
history
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
go
from
it
;
and
then
she
fall
into
her
rhapsody
again
,
and
exclamation
at
the
severity
of
her
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
when
these
thing
be
a
little
over
with
her
,
we
fall
into
a
close
debate
about
what
should
be
first
do
before
we
give
an
account
of
the
matter
to
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
what
purpose
could
be
all
our
consultation
?
<EOS>
We
could
neither
of
us
see
our
way
through
it
,
nor
see
how
it
could
be
safe
to
open
such
a
scene
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
make
any
judgment
,
or
give
any
guess
at
what
temper
he
would
receive
it
in
,
or
what
measure
he
would
take
upon
it
;
and
if
he
should
have
so
little
government
of
himself
as
to
make
it
public
,
we
easily
foresaw
that
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
whole
family
,
and
expose
my
mother
and
me
to
the
last
degree
;
and
if
at
last
he
should
take
the
advantage
the
law
would
give
him
,
he
may
put
me
away
with
disdain
and
leave
me
to
sue
for
the
little
portion
that
I
have
,
and
perhaps
waste
it
all
in
the
suit
,
and
then
be
a
beggar
;
the
child
would
be
ruin
too
,
have
no
legal
claim
to
any
of
his
effect
;
and
thus
I
should
see
him
,
perhaps
,
in
the
arm
of
another
wife
in
a
few
month
,
and
be
myself
the
most
miserable
creature
alive
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
be
as
sensible
of
this
as
I
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
we
know
not
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
time
we
come
to
more
sober
resolution
,
but
then
it
be
with
this
misfortune
too
,
that
my
mother
's
opinion
and
mine
be
quite
different
from
one
another
,
and
indeed
inconsistent
with
one
another
;
for
my
mother
's
opinion
be
,
that
I
should
bury
the
whole
thing
entirely
,
and
continue
to
live
with
him
as
my
husband
till
some
other
event
should
make
the
discovery
of
it
more
convenient
;
and
that
in
the
meantime
she
would
endeavour
to
reconcile
us
together
again
,
and
restore
our
mutual
comfort
and
family
peace
;
that
we
may
lie
as
we
use
to
do
together
,
and
so
let
the
whole
matter
remain
a
secret
as
close
as
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
we
be
both
undone
if
it
come
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
encourage
me
to
this
,
she
promise
to
make
me
easy
in
my
circumstance
,
as
far
as
she
be
able
,
and
to
leave
me
what
she
could
at
her
death
,
secure
for
me
separately
from
my
husband
;
so
that
if
it
should
come
out
afterwards
,
I
should
not
be
leave
destitute
,
but
be
able
to
stand
on
my
own
foot
and
procure
justice
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
proposal
do
not
agree
at
all
with
my
judgment
of
the
thing
,
though
it
be
very
fair
and
kind
in
my
mother
;
but
my
thought
run
quite
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
keep
the
thing
in
our
own
breast
,
and
let
it
all
remain
as
it
be
,
I
tell
her
it
be
impossible
;
and
I
ask
her
how
she
could
think
I
could
bear
the
thought
of
lie
with
my
own
brother
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
I
tell
her
that
her
be
alive
be
the
only
support
of
the
discovery
,
and
that
while
she
own
me
for
her
child
,
and
see
reason
to
be
satisfied
that
I
be
so
,
nobody
else
would
doubt
it
;
but
that
if
she
should
die
before
the
discovery
,
I
should
be
take
for
an
impudent
creature
that
have
forge
such
a
thing
to
go
away
from
my
husband
,
or
should
be
count
craze
and
distract
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
tell
her
how
he
have
threaten
already
to
put
me
into
a
madhouse
,
and
what
concern
I
have
be
in
about
it
,
and
how
that
be
the
thing
that
drive
me
to
the
necessity
of
discover
it
to
her
as
I
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
from
all
which
I
tell
her
,
that
I
have
,
on
the
most
serious
reflection
I
be
able
to
make
in
the
case
,
come
to
this
resolution
,
which
I
hope
she
would
like
,
as
a
medium
between
both
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
she
should
use
her
endeavour
with
her
son
to
give
me
leave
to
go
to
England
,
as
I
have
desire
,
and
to
furnish
me
with
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
,
either
in
good
along
with
me
,
or
in
bill
for
my
support
there
,
all
along
suggest
that
he
may
one
time
or
other
<EOS>
think
it
proper
to
come
over
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
that
when
I
be
go
,
she
should
then
,
in
cold
blood
,
and
after
first
oblige
him
in
the
solemn
manner
possible
to
secrecy
,
discover
the
case
to
him
,
do
it
gradually
,
and
as
her
own
discretion
should
guide
her
,
so
that
he
may
not
be
surprised
with
it
,
and
fly
out
into
any
passion
and
excess
on
my
account
,
or
on
hers
;
and
that
she
should
concern
herself
to
prevent
his
slight
the
child
,
or
marry
again
,
unless
he
have
a
certain
account
of
my
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
my
scheme
,
and
my
reason
be
good
;
I
be
really
alienated
from
him
in
the
consequence
of
these
thing
;
indeed
,
I
mortally
hate
him
as
a
husband
,
and
it
be
impossible
to
remove
that
rivet
aversion
I
have
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
it
be
an
unlawful
,
incestuous
living
,
add
to
that
aversion
,
and
though
I
have
no
great
concern
about
it
in
point
of
conscience
,
yet
everything
add
to
make
cohabiting
with
him
the
most
nauseous
thing
to
me
in
the
world
;
and
I
think
verily
it
be
come
to
such
a
height
,
that
I
could
almost
as
willingly
have
embrace
a
dog
as
have
let
him
offer
anything
of
that
kind
to
me
,
for
which
reason
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
come
between
the
sheet
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
be
right
in
point
of
policy
in
carry
it
such
a
length
,
while
at
the
same
time
I
do
not
resolve
to
discover
the
thing
to
him
;
but
I
be
give
an
account
of
what
be
,
not
of
what
ought
or
ought
not
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
in
their
directly
opposite
opinion
to
one
another
my
mother
<EOS>
and
I
continue
a
long
time
,
and
it
be
impossible
to
reconcile
our
judgment
;
many
dispute
we
have
about
it
,
but
we
could
never
either
of
us
yield
our
own
,
or
bring
over
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
insist
on
my
aversion
to
lie
with
my
own
brother
,
and
she
insist
upon
its
be
impossible
to
bring
him
to
consent
to
my
go
from
him
to
England
;
and
in
this
uncertainty
we
continue
,
not
differ
so
as
to
quarrel
,
or
anything
like
it
,
but
<EOS>
so
as
not
to
be
able
to
resolve
what
we
should
do
to
make
up
that
terrible
breach
that
be
before
us
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
I
resolve
on
a
desperate
course
,
and
tell
my
mother
my
resolution
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
,
in
short
,
I
would
tell
him
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
My
mother
be
fright
to
the
last
degree
at
the
very
thought
of
it
;
but
I
bid
her
be
easy
,
tell
her
I
would
do
it
gradually
and
softly
,
and
with
all
the
art
and
good
-
humour
<EOS>
I
be
mistress
of
,
and
time
it
also
as
well
as
I
could
,
take
him
in
good
-
humour
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
do
not
question
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
could
be
hypocrite
enough
to
feign
more
affection
to
him
than
I
really
have
,
I
should
succeed
in
all
my
design
,
and
we
may
part
by
consent
,
and
with
a
good
agreement
,
for
I
may
live
him
well
enough
for
a
brother
,
though
I
could
not
for
a
husband
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
<EOS>
while
he
lie
at
my
mother
to
find
out
,
if
possible
,
what
be
the
meaning
of
that
dreadful
expression
of
mine
,
as
he
call
it
,
which
I
mention
before
:
 
namely
,
that
I
be
not
his
lawful
wife
,
nor
my
child
his
legal
child
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
put
him
off
,
tell
him
she
could
bring
me
to
no
explanation
,
but
find
there
be
something
that
disturb
me
very
much
,
and
she
hope
she
should
get
it
out
of
me
in
time
,
and
in
the
meantime
recommend
to
him
earnestly
to
use
me
more
tenderly
,
and
win
me
with
his
usual
good
carriage
;
tell
him
of
his
 
terrifying
and
affright
me
with
his
threat
of
send
me
to
a
madhouse
,
and
the
like
,
and
advise
him
not
to
make
a
woman
desperate
on
any
account
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
He
promise
her
to
soften
his
behaviour
,
and
bid
her
assure
me
that
he
love
me
as
well
as
ever
,
and
that
he
have
so
such
design
as
that
of
send
me
to
a
madhouse
,
whatever
he
may
say
in
his
passion
;
also
he
desire
my
mother
to
use
the
same
persuasion
to
me
too
,
that
our
affection
may
be
renew
,
and
we
may
lie
together
in
a
good
understanding
as
we
use
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
the
effect
of
this
treaty
presently
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
's
conduct
be
immediately
alter
,
and
he
be
quite
another
man
to
me
;
nothing
could
be
kind
and
more
obliging
than
he
be
to
me
upon
all
occasion
;
and
I
could
do
no
less
than
make
some
return
to
it
,
which
I
do
as
well
as
I
could
,
but
it
be
but
in
an
awkward
manner
at
best
,
for
nothing
be
more
frightful
to
me
than
his
caress
,
and
the
apprehension
of
be
with
child
again
by
him
be
ready
to
throw
me
into
fit
;
and
this
make
me
see
that
there
be
an
absolute
necessity
of
break
the
case
to
him
without
any
more
delay
,
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
I
do
with
all
the
caution
and
reserve
imaginable
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
continue
his
altered
carriage
to
me
near
a
month
,
and
we
begin
to
live
a
new
kind
of
life
with
one
another
;
and
could
I
have
satisfy
myself
to
have
go
on
with
it
<EOS>
,
I
believe
it
may
have
continue
as
long
as
we
have
continue
alive
together
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
,
as
we
be
sit
and
talk
very
friendly
together
under
a
little
awning
,
which
serve
as
an
arbour
at
the
entrance
from
our
house
into
the
garden
,
he
be
in
a
very
pleasant
,
agreeable
humour
,
and
say
abundance
of
kind
thing
to
me
relate
to
the
pleasure
of
our
present
good
agreement
,
and
the
disorder
of
our
past
breach
,
and
what
a
satisfaction
it
be
to
him
that
we
have
room
to
hope
we
should
never
have
any
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
tell
him
there
be
nobody
in
the
world
could
be
more
delighted
than
I
be
in
the
good
agreement
we
have
always
keep
up
,
or
more
afflicted
with
the
breach
of
it
,
and
should
be
so
still
;
but
I
be
sorry
to
tell
him
that
there
be
an
unhappy
circumstance
in
our
case
,
which
lie
too
close
to
my
heart
,
and
which
I
know
not
how
to
break
to
him
,
that
render
my
part
of
it
very
miserable
,
and
take
from
me
all
the
comfort
of
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
He
importune
me
to
tell
him
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
could
not
tell
how
to
do
it
;
that
while
it
be
conceal
from
him
I
alone
be
unhappy
,
but
if
he
know
it
also
,
we
should
be
both
so
;
and
that
,
therefore
,
to
keep
him
in
the
dark
about
it
be
the
kind
thing
that
I
could
do
,
and
it
be
on
that
account
alone
that
I
keep
a
secret
from
him
,
the
very
keeping
of
which
,
I
think
,
would
first
or
last
be
my
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
his
surprise
at
this
relation
,
and
the
double
importunity
which
he
use
with
me
to
discover
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
could
not
be
call
kind
to
him
,
nay
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
be
faithful
to
him
if
I
conceal
it
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
think
so
too
,
and
yet
I
could
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
back
to
what
I
have
say
before
to
him
,
and
tell
me
he
hope
it
do
not
relate
to
what
I
have
say
in
my
passion
,
and
that
he
have
resolve
to
forget
all
that
as
the
effect
of
a
rash
,
provoke
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
wish
I
could
forget
it
all
too
,
but
that
it
be
not
to
be
do
,
the
impression
be
too
deep
,
and
I
could
not
do
it
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
tell
me
he
be
resolve
not
to
differ
with
me
in
anything
,
and
that
therefore
he
would
importune
me
no
more
about
it
,
resolve
to
acquiesce
in
whatever
I
do
or
say
;
only
beg
I
should
then
agree
,
that
whatever
it
be
,
it
should
no
more
interrupt
our
quiet
and
our
mutual
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
most
provoking
thing
he
could
have
say
to
me
,
for
I
really
want
his
further
importunity
,
that
I
may
be
prevail
with
to
bring
out
that
which
indeed
it
be
like
death
to
me
to
conceal
;
so
I
answer
him
plainly
that
I
could
not
say
I
be
glad
not
to
be
importune
,
think
I
could
not
tell
how
to
comply
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
come
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
condition
will
you
make
with
me
upon
the
opening
this
affair
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
any
condition
in
the
world
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
you
can
in
reason
desire
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
come
,
give
it
me
under
your
hand
,
that
if
you
do
not
find
I
be
in
any
fault
,
or
that
I
be
willingly
concerned
in
the
cause
of
the
misfortune
that
be
to
follow
,
you
will
not
blame
me
,
use
me
the
bad
,
do
my
any
injury
,
or
make
me
be
the
sufferer
for
that
which
be
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
the
most
reasonable
demand
in
the
world
:
not
to
blame
you
for
that
which
be
not
your
fault
.
 
<EOS>
give
me
a
pen
and
ink
,
"
say
he
;
so
I
run
in
and
fetch
a
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
he
write
the
condition
down
in
the
very
word
I
have
propose
it
,
and
sign
it
with
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
 
he
,
"
what
be
next
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
next
be
,
that
you
will
not
blame
me
for
not
discover
the
secret
of
it
to
you
before
I
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
just
again
,
"
say
he
;
"
with
all
my
heart
"
;
so
he
write
down
that
also
,
and
sign
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
then
I
have
but
one
condition
more
to
make
with
you
,
and
that
is
,
that
as
there
be
nobody
concerned
in
it
<EOS>
but
you
and
I
,
you
shall
not
discover
it
to
any
person
in
the
world
,
except
your
own
mother
;
and
that
in
all
the
measure
you
shall
take
upon
the
discovery
,
as
I
be
equally
concerned
in
it
with
you
,
though
as
innocent
as
yourself
,
you
shall
do
nothing
in
a
passion
,
nothing
to
my
prejudice
or
to
your
mother
's
prejudice
,
without
my
knowledge
and
consent
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
a
little
amazed
him
,
and
he
write
down
the
word
distinctly
,
but
read
them
over
and
over
before
he
sign
them
,
hesitate
at
them
several
time
,
and
repeat
them
:
 
<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
prejudice
!
<EOS>
and
your
prejudice
!
 
<EOS>
what
mysterious
thing
can
this
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
he
sign
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
say
I
,
"
my
dear
,
I
will
ask
you
no
more
under
your
hand
;
but
as
you
be
to
hear
the
most
unexpected
and
surprising
thing
that
perhaps
ever
befall
any
family
in
the
world
,
I
beg
you
to
promise
me
you
will
receive
it
with
composure
and
a
presence
of
mind
suitable
to
a
man
of
sense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
utmost
,
"
say
he
,
"
upon
condition
you
will
keep
me
no
longer
in
suspense
,
for
you
terrify
me
with
all
these
preliminary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
be
this
:
as
I
tell
you
before
in
a
heat
,
that
I
be
not
your
lawful
wife
,
and
that
our
child
be
not
legal
child
,
so
I
must
let
you
know
now
in
calmness
and
in
kindness
,
but
with
affliction
enough
,
that
I
be
your
own
sister
,
and
you
my
own
brother
,
and
that
we
be
both
the
child
of
our
mother
now
alive
,
and
in
the
house
,
who
be
convince
of
the
truth
of
it
,
in
a
manner
not
to
be
deny
or
contradict
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
him
turn
pale
and
look
wild
;
and
I
say
,
"
now
remember
your
promise
,
and
receive
it
with
presence
of
mind
;
for
who
could
have
say
more
to
prepare
you
for
it
than
I
have
do
?
"
<EOS>
however
,
I
call
a
servant
,
and
get
him
a
little
glass
of
rum
(
which
be
the
usual
dram
of
that
country
)
,
for
he
be
just
faint
away
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
a
little
recovered
,
I
say
to
him
,
"
this
story
,
you
may
be
sure
,
require
a
long
explanation
,
and
therefore
,
have
patience
and
compose
your
mind
to
hear
it
out
,
and
I
will
make
it
as
short
as
I
can
'
;
and
with
this
,
I
tell
him
what
I
think
be
needful
of
the
fact
,
and
particularly
how
my
mother
come
to
discover
it
to
me
,
as
above
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
will
see
reason
for
my
capitulation
,
and
that
I
neither
have
be
the
cause
of
this
matter
,
nor
could
be
so
,
and
that
I
could
know
nothing
of
it
before
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
fully
satisfied
of
that
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
'
tis
a
dreadful
surprise
to
me
;
however
,
I
know
a
remedy
for
it
all
,
and
a
remedy
that
shall
put
an
end
to
your
difficulty
,
without
your
go
to
England
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
would
be
strange
,
"
say
I
,
"
as
all
the
rest
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
make
it
easy
;
there
be
nobody
in
the
way
of
it
but
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
look
a
little
disorder
when
he
say
this
,
but
I
do
not
apprehend
anything
from
it
at
that
time
,
believe
,
as
it
use
to
be
say
,
that
they
who
do
those
thing
never
talk
of
them
,
or
that
they
who
talk
of
such
thing
never
do
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
thing
be
not
come
to
their
height
with
him
,
and
I
observe
he
become
pensive
and
melancholy
;
and
in
a
word
,
as
I
think
,
a
little
distemper
in
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
talk
him
into
temper
,
and
to
reason
him
into
a
kind
of
scheme
for
our
government
in
the
affair
,
and
sometimes
he
would
be
well
,
and
talk
with
some
courage
about
it
;
but
the
weight
of
it
lie
too
heavy
upon
his
thought
,
and
,
in
short
,
it
go
so
far
that
he
make
attempt
upon
himself
,
and
in
one
of
them
have
actually
strangle
himself
and
have
not
his
mother
come
into
the
room
in
the
very
moment
,
he
have
die
;
but
with
the
help
of
a
Negro
servant
she
cut
him
down
and
recover
him
.
  
<EOS>
thing
be
now
come
to
a
lamentable
height
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
My
pity
for
him
now
begin
to
revive
that
affection
which
at
first
I
really
have
for
him
,
and
I
endeavour
sincerely
,
by
all
the
kind
carriage
<EOS>
I
could
,
to
make
up
the
breach
;
but
,
in
short
,
it
have
get
too
great
a
head
,
it
prey
upon
his
spirit
,
and
it
throw
him
into
a
long
,
linger
consumption
,
though
it
happen
not
to
be
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
distress
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
,
as
his
life
be
apparently
decline
,
and
I
may
perhaps
have
marry
again
there
,
very
much
to
my
advantage
;
it
have
be
certainly
my
business
to
have
stay
in
the
country
,
but
my
mind
be
restless
too
,
and
uneasy
<EOS>
;
I
hanker
after
come
to
England
,
and
nothing
would
satisfy
me
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
by
an
unwearied
importunity
,
my
husband
,
who
be
apparently
decay
,
as
I
observe
,
be
at
last
prevail
with
;
and
<EOS>
so
my
own
fate
push
me
on
<EOS>
,
the
way
be
make
clear
for
me
,
and
my
mother
concur
,
I
obtain
a
very
good
cargo
for
my
coming
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
part
with
my
brother
(
for
such
I
be
now
to
call
him
)
,
we
agree
that
after
I
arrive
he
should
pretend
to
have
an
account
that
I
be
dead
in
England
,
and
so
may
marry
again
when
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
He
promise
,
and
engage
to
me
to
correspond
with
me
as
a
sister
,
and
to
assist
and
support
me
as
long
as
I
live
;
and
that
if
he
die
before
me
,
he
would
leave
sufficient
to
his
mother
to
take
care
of
me
still
,
in
the
name
of
a
sister
,
and
he
be
in
some
respect
careful
of
me
,
when
he
hear
of
me
;
but
it
be
so
oddly
manage
that
I
feel
the
disappointment
very
sensibly
afterwards
,
as
you
shall
hear
in
its
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
away
for
England
in
the
month
of
August
,
after
I
have
be
eight
year
in
that
country
;
and
now
a
new
scene
of
misfortune
attend
me
,
which
perhaps
few
woman
have
go
through
the
life
of
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
an
indifferent
good
voyage
till
we
come
just
upon
the
coast
of
England
,
and
where
we
arrive
in
two
-
and
-
thirty
day
,
but
be
then
ruffle
with
two
or
three
storm
,
one
of
which
drive
us
away
to
the
coast
of
Ireland
,
and
we
put
in
at
Kinsdale
.
<EOS>
We
remain
there
about
thirteen
day
,
get
some
refreshment
on
shore
,
and
put
to
sea
again
,
though
we
meet
with
very
bad
weather
again
,
in
which
the
ship
spring
her
mainmast
,
as
they
call
it
,
for
I
know
not
what
they
mean
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
get
at
last
into
Milford
Haven
,
in
Wales
,
where
,
though
it
be
remote
from
our
port
,
yet
have
my
foot
safe
upon
the
firm
ground
of
my
native
country
,
the
isle
of
Britain
,
I
resolve
to
venture
it
no
more
upon
the
water
,
which
have
be
so
terrible
to
me
;
so
get
my
clothe
and
money
on
shore
,
with
my
bill
of
loading
and
other
paper
<EOS>
,
I
resolve
to
come
for
London
,
and
leave
the
ship
to
get
to
her
port
as
she
could
;
the
port
whither
she
be
bind
be
to
Bristol
,
where
my
brother
's
chief
correspondent
live
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
to
London
in
about
three
week
,
where
I
hear
a
little
while
after
that
the
ship
be
arrive
in
Bristol
,
but
at
the
same
time
have
the
misfortune
to
know
that
by
the
violent
weather
she
have
be
in
,
and
the
breaking
of
her
mainmast
,
she
have
great
damage
on
board
,
and
that
a
great
part
of
her
cargo
be
spoil
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
a
new
scene
of
life
upon
my
hand
,
and
a
dreadful
appearance
it
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
come
away
with
a
kind
of
final
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
bring
with
me
be
indeed
considerable
,
have
it
come
safe
,
and
by
the
help
of
it
,
I
may
have
marry
again
tolerably
well
;
but
as
it
be
,
I
be
reduce
to
between
two
or
three
hundred
pound
in
the
whole
,
and
this
without
any
hope
of
recruit
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
entirely
without
friend
,
nay
,
even
so
much
as
without
acquaintance
,
for
I
find
it
be
absolutely
necessary
not
to
revive
former
acquaintance
;
and
as
for
my
subtle
friend
that
set
me
up
formerly
for
a
fortune
,
she
be
dead
,
and
her
husband
also
;
as
I
be
inform
,
upon
send
a
person
unknown
to
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
the
look
after
my
cargo
of
good
soon
after
oblige
me
to
take
a
journey
to
Bristol
,
and
during
my
attendance
upon
that
affair
I
take
the
diversion
of
go
to
the
Bath
,
for
as
I
be
still
far
from
be
old
,
so
my
humour
,
which
be
always
gay
,
continue
so
to
an
extreme
;
and
be
now
,
as
it
be
,
a
woman
of
fortune
though
I
be
a
woman
without
a
fortune
,
I
expect
something
or
other
may
happen
in
my
way
that
may
mend
my
circumstance
,
as
have
be
my
case
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
Bath
be
a
place
of
gallantry
enough
;
expensive
,
and
full
of
snare
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
thither
,
indeed
,
in
the
view
of
take
anything
that
may
offer
,
but
I
must
do
myself
justice
,
as
to
protest
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
amiss
;
I
mean
nothing
but
in
an
honest
way
,
nor
have
I
any
thought
about
me
at
first
that
look
the
way
which
afterwards
I
suffer
them
to
be
guide
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
stay
the
whole
latter
season
,
as
it
be
call
there
,
and
contract
some
unhappy
acquaintance
,
which
rather
prompt
the
folly
I
fall
afterwards
into
than
fortify
me
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
live
pleasantly
enough
,
keep
good
company
,
that
be
to
say
,
gay
,
fine
company
;
but
have
the
discouragement
to
find
this
way
of
living
sink
me
exceedingly
,
and
that
as
I
have
no
settle
income
,
so
spend
upon
the
main
stock
be
but
a
certain
kind
of
bleed
to
death
;
and
this
give
me
many
sad
reflection
in
the
interval
of
my
other
thought
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
shake
them
off
,
and
still
flatter
myself
that
something
or
other
may
offer
for
my
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
the
wrong
place
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
now
at
Redriff
,
where
,
if
I
have
set
myself
tolerably
up
,
some
honest
sea
captain
or
other
may
have
talk
with
me
upon
the
honourable
term
of
matrimony
;
but
I
be
at
the
Bath
,
where
man
find
a
mistress
sometimes
,
but
very
rarely
look
for
a
wife
;
and
consequently
all
the
particular
acquaintance
a
woman
can
expect
to
make
there
must
have
some
tendency
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
spend
the
first
season
well
enough
;
for
though
I
have
contract
some
acquaintance
with
a
gentleman
who
come
to
the
Bath
for
his
diversion
,
yet
I
have
enter
into
no
felonious
treaty
,
as
it
may
be
call
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
resist
some
casual
offer
of
gallantry
,
and
have
manage
that
way
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
wicked
enough
to
come
into
the
crime
for
the
mere
vice
of
it
,
and
I
have
no
extraordinary
offer
make
me
that
tempt
me
with
the
main
thing
which
I
want
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
go
this
length
the
first
season
,
viz
.
<EOS>
I
contract
an
acquaintance
with
a
woman
in
whose
house
I
lodge
,
who
,
though
she
do
not
keep
an
ill
house
,
as
we
call
it
,
yet
have
none
of
the
good
principle
in
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
on
all
occasion
<EOS>
behave
myself
so
well
as
not
to
get
the
least
slur
upon
my
reputation
on
any
account
whatever
,
and
all
the
man
that
I
have
converse
with
be
of
so
good
reputation
that
I
have
not
give
the
least
reflection
by
converse
with
them
;
nor
do
any
of
them
seem
to
think
there
be
room
for
a
wicked
correspondence
,
if
they
have
any
of
them
offer
it
;
yet
there
be
one
gentleman
,
as
above
,
who
always
single
me
out
for
the
diversion
of
my
company
,
as
he
call
it
,
which
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
say
,
be
very
agreeable
to
him
,
but
at
that
time
there
be
no
more
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
many
melancholy
hour
at
the
Bath
after
the
company
be
go
;
for
though
I
go
to
Bristol
sometime
for
the
dispose
my
effect
,
and
for
recruit
of
money
,
yet
I
choose
to
come
back
to
Bath
for
my
residence
,
because
be
on
good
term
with
the
woman
in
whose
house
I
lodge
in
the
summer
,
I
find
that
during
the
winter
I
live
rather
cheap
there
than
I
could
do
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
I
say
,
I
pass
the
winter
as
heavily
as
I
have
pass
the
autumn
cheerfully
;
but
have
contract
a
near
intimacy
with
the
say
woman
in
whose
house
I
lodge
,
I
could
not
avoid
communicate
to
her
something
of
what
lie
hardest
upon
my
mind
and
particularly
the
narrowness
of
my
circumstance
,
and
the
loss
of
my
fortune
by
the
damage
of
my
good
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
also
,
that
I
have
a
mother
and
a
brother
in
Virginia
in
good
circumstance
;
and
as
I
have
really
write
back
to
my
mother
in
particular
to
represent
my
condition
,
and
the
great
loss
I
have
receive
,
which
indeed
come
to
almost
#
#
#
#
500
,
so
<EOS>
I
do
not
fail
to
let
my
new
friend
know
that
I
expect
a
supply
from
thence
,
and
so
indeed
I
do
;
and
as
the
ship
go
from
Bristol
to
York
River
,
in
Virginia
,
and
back
again
generally
in
less
time
from
London
,
and
that
my
brother
correspond
chiefly
at
Bristol
,
I
think
it
be
much
well
for
me
to
wait
here
for
my
return
than
to
go
to
London
,
where
also
I
have
not
the
least
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
My
new
friend
appear
sensibly
affected
with
my
condition
,
and
indeed
be
so
very
kind
as
to
reduce
the
rate
of
my
living
with
her
to
so
low
a
price
during
the
winter
,
that
she
convince
me
<EOS>
she
get
nothing
by
me
;
and
as
for
lodging
,
during
the
winter
I
pay
nothing
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
spring
season
come
on
,
she
continue
to
be
as
kind
to
me
as
she
could
,
and
I
lodge
with
her
for
a
time
,
till
it
be
find
necessary
to
do
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
some
person
of
character
that
frequently
lodge
in
her
house
,
and
in
particular
the
gentleman
who
,
as
I
say
,
single
me
out
for
his
companion
the
winter
before
;
and
he
come
down
again
with
another
gentleman
in
his
company
and
two
servant
,
and
lodge
in
the
same
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
that
my
landlady
have
invite
him
thither
,
let
him
know
that
I
be
still
with
her
;
but
she
deny
it
,
and
protest
to
me
that
she
do
not
,
and
he
say
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
this
gentleman
come
down
and
continue
to
single
me
out
for
his
peculiar
confidence
as
well
as
conversation
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
complete
gentleman
,
that
must
be
confess
,
and
his
company
be
very
agreeable
to
me
,
as
mine
,
if
I
may
believe
him
,
be
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
no
profession
to
be
but
of
an
extraordinary
respect
,
and
he
have
such
an
opinion
of
my
virtue
,
that
,
as
he
often
profess
,
he
believe
if
he
should
offer
anything
else
,
I
should
reject
him
with
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
understand
from
me
that
I
be
a
widow
;
that
I
have
arrive
at
Bristol
from
Virginia
by
the
last
ship
;
and
that
I
wait
at
Bath
till
the
next
Virginia
fleet
should
arrive
,
by
which
I
expect
considerable
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
by
him
,
and
by
other
of
him
,
that
he
have
a
wife
,
but
that
the
lady
be
distemper
in
her
head
,
and
be
under
the
conduct
of
her
own
relation
,
which
he
consent
to
,
to
avoid
any
reflection
that
may
(
as
be
not
unusual
in
such
case
)
be
cast
on
him
for
mismanage
her
cure
;
and
in
the
meantime
he
come
to
the
Bath
to
divert
his
thought
from
the
disturbance
of
such
a
melancholy
circumstance
as
that
be
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlady
,
who
of
her
own
accord
encourage
the
correspondence
on
all
occasion
,
give
me
an
advantageous
 
character
of
him
,
as
a
man
of
honour
and
of
virtue
,
as
well
as
of
great
estate
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
have
a
great
deal
of
reason
to
say
so
of
him
too
;
for
though
we
lodge
both
on
a
floor
,
and
he
have
frequently
come
into
my
chamber
,
even
when
I
be
in
bed
,
and
<EOS>
I
also
into
his
when
he
be
in
bed
,
yet
he
never
offer
anything
to
me
further
than
a
kiss
,
or
so
much
as
solicit
me
to
anything
till
long
after
,
as
you
shall
hear
.
  
<EOS>
I
frequently
take
notice
to
my
landlady
of
his
exceed
modesty
,
and
she
again
use
to
tell
me
<EOS>
,
she
believe
it
be
so
from
the
beginning
;
however
,
she
use
to
tell
me
that
she
think
I
ought
to
expect
some
gratification
from
him
for
my
company
,
for
indeed
he
do
,
as
it
be
,
engross
me
,
and
I
be
seldom
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
have
not
give
him
the
least
occasion
to
think
I
want
it
,
or
that
I
would
accept
of
it
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
she
would
take
that
part
upon
her
,
and
she
do
so
,
and
manage
it
so
dexterously
,
that
the
first
time
we
be
together
alone
,
after
she
have
talk
with
him
,
he
begin
to
inquire
a
little
into
my
circumstance
,
as
how
I
have
subsist
myself
since
I
come
on
shore
,
and
whether
I
do
not
want
money
.
<EOS>
I
stand
off
very
boldly
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
though
my
cargo
of
tobacco
be
damage
,
yet
that
it
be
not
quite
lose
;
that
the
merchant
I
have
be
consign
to
have
so
honestly
manage
for
me
that
I
have
not
want
,
and
that
I
hope
,
with
frugal
management
<EOS>
,
I
should
make
it
hold
out
till
more
would
come
,
which
I
expect
by
the
next
fleet
;
that
in
the
meantime
I
have
retrench
my
expense
,
and
whereas
I
keep
a
maid
last
season
,
now
I
live
without
;
and
whereas
I
have
a
chamber
and
a
dining
-
room
then
on
the
first
floor
,
as
he
know
,
I
now
have
but
one
room
,
two
pair
of
stair
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
live
,
"
say
I
,
"
as
well
satisfied
now
as
I
do
then
"
;
add
,
that
his
company
have
be
a
means
to
make
me
live
much
more
cheerfully
than
otherwise
I
should
have
do
,
for
which
I
be
much
oblige
to
him
;
and
so
I
put
off
all
room
for
any
offer
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
not
long
before
he
attack
me
again
,
and
tell
me
he
find
that
I
be
backward
to
trust
him
with
the
secret
of
my
circumstance
,
which
he
be
sorry
for
;
assure
me
that
he
inquire
into
it
with
no
design
to
satisfy
his
own
curiosity
,
but
merely
to
assist
me
,
if
there
be
any
occasion
;
but
since
I
would
not
own
myself
to
stand
in
need
of
any
assistance
,
he
have
<EOS>
but
one
thing
more
to
desire
of
me
,
and
that
be
,
that
I
would
promise
him
that
when
I
be
any
way
straiten
,
or
like
to
be
so
,
I
would
frankly
tell
him
of
it
,
and
that
I
would
make
use
of
him
with
the
same
freedom
that
he
make
the
offer
;
add
,
that
I
should
always
find
I
have
a
true
friend
,
though
perhaps
I
be
afraid
to
trust
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
omit
nothing
that
be
fit
to
be
say
by
one
infinitely
oblige
,
to
let
him
know
that
I
have
a
due
sense
of
his
kindness
;
and
indeed
from
that
time
I
do
not
appear
so
much
reserve
to
him
as
I
have
do
before
,
though
still
within
the
bound
of
the
strict
virtue
on
both
side
;
but
how
free
soever
our
conversation
be
,
<EOS>
I
could
not
arrive
to
that
sort
of
freedom
which
he
desire
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
tell
him
I
want
money
,
though
I
be
secretly
very
glad
of
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
some
week
pass
after
this
,
and
still
I
never
ask
him
for
money
;
when
my
landlady
,
a
cunning
creature
,
who
have
often
press
me
to
it
,
but
find
that
I
could
not
do
it
,
make
a
story
of
her
own
inventing
,
and
come
in
bluntly
to
me
when
we
be
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
widow
!
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
bad
news
to
tell
you
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
;
"
be
the
Virginia
ship
take
by
the
French
?
"
 
<EOS>
for
that
be
my
fear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
"
say
she
,
"
but
the
man
you
send
to
Bristol
yesterday
for
money
be
come
back
,
and
say
he
have
bring
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
I
could
by
no
means
like
her
project
;
I
though
it
look
too
much
like
prompt
him
,
which
indeed
he
do
not
want
,
and
I
clearly
see
that
I
should
lose
nothing
by
be
backward
to
ask
,
so
I
take
her
up
short
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
image
why
he
should
say
so
to
you
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
assure
you
he
bring
me
all
the
money
I
send
him
for
,
and
here
it
be
,
"
say
I
(
pull
out
my
purse
with
about
twelve
guinea
in
it
)
;
and
add
,
"
I
intend
you
shall
have
most
of
it
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
seem
distaste
a
little
at
her
talk
as
she
do
at
first
,
as
well
as
I
,
take
it
,
as
I
fancy
he
would
,
as
something
forward
of
her
;
but
when
he
see
me
give
such
an
answer
,
he
come
immediately
to
himself
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
we
talk
of
it
again
,
when
I
find
he
be
fully
satisfied
,
and
,
smile
,
say
he
hope
I
would
not
want
money
and
not
tell
him
of
it
,
and
that
I
have
promise
him
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
have
be
very
much
dissatisfied
at
my
landlady
's
talk
<EOS>
so
publicly
the
day
before
of
 
what
she
have
nothing
to
do
with
;
but
I
suppose
she
want
what
I
owe
her
,
<EOS>
which
be
about
eight
guinea
,
which
I
have
resolve
to
give
her
,
and
have
accordingly
give
it
her
the
same
night
she
talk
so
foolishly
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
may
good
humour
when
he
hear
me
say
I
have
pay
her
,
and
it
go
off
into
some
other
discourse
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
but
the
next
morning
,
he
have
hear
me
up
about
my
room
before
him
,
he
call
to
me
,
and
I
answer
,
he
ask
me
to
come
into
his
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
bed
when
I
come
in
,
and
he
make
me
come
and
sit
down
on
his
bedside
,
for
he
say
he
have
something
to
say
to
me
which
be
of
some
moment
.
<EOS>
after
some
very
kind
expression
,
he
ask
me
if
I
would
be
very
honest
to
him
,
and
give
a
sincere
answer
to
one
thing
he
would
desire
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
little
cavil
at
the
word
"
sincere
,
"
and
ask
him
if
I
have
ever
give
him
any
answer
which
be
not
sincere
,
I
promise
him
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
his
request
be
,
he
say
,
to
let
him
see
my
purse
.
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
put
my
hand
into
my
pocket
,
and
,
laugh
to
him
,
pull
it
out
,
and
there
be
in
it
three
guinea
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
ask
me
if
there
be
all
the
money
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
no
,
laugh
again
,
not
by
a
great
deal
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
he
say
,
he
would
have
me
promise
to
go
and
fetch
him
all
the
money
I
have
,
every
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
,
and
I
go
into
my
chamber
and
fetch
him
a
little
private
drawer
,
where
I
have
about
six
guinea
more
,
and
some
silver
,
and
throw
it
all
down
upon
the
bed
,
and
tell
him
there
be
all
my
wealth
,
honestly
to
a
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
a
little
at
it
,
but
do
not
tell
it
,
and
huddle
it
all
into
the
drawer
again
,
and
then
reach
his
pocket
,
pull
out
a
key
,
and
bade
me
open
a
little
walnut
-
tree
box
he
have
upon
the
table
,
and
bring
him
such
a
drawer
,
which
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
in
which
drawer
there
be
a
great
deal
of
money
in
gold
<EOS>
,
I
believe
near
two
hundred
guinea
,
but
I
know
not
how
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
drawer
,
and
take
my
hand
,
make
me
put
it
in
and
take
a
whole
handful
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
backward
at
that
,
but
he
hold
my
hand
hard
in
his
hand
,
and
put
it
into
the
drawer
,
and
make
me
take
out
as
many
guinea
almost
as
I
could
well
take
up
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
so
,
he
make
me
put
them
into
my
lap
,
and
take
my
little
drawer
,
and
pour
out
all
my
money
among
his
,
and
bade
me
get
me
go
,
and
carry
it
all
home
into
my
own
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
I
relate
this
story
the
more
particularly
because
of
the
good
-
humour
there
be
in
it
,
and
to
show
the
temper
with
which
we
converse
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
after
this
<EOS>
but
he
begin
every
day
to
find
fault
with
my
clothe
,
with
my
lace
and
headdress
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
press
me
to
buy
better
;
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
be
willing
enough
to
do
,
though
I
do
not
seem
to
be
so
,
for
I
love
nothing
in
the
world
better
than
fine
clothe
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
must
housewife
the
money
he
have
lend
me
,
or
<EOS>
else
I
should
not
be
able
to
pay
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
tell
me
,
in
a
few
word
,
that
as
he
have
a
sincere
respect
for
me
,
and
know
my
circumstance
,
he
have
not
lend
me
that
money
,
but
give
it
me
,
and
that
he
think
I
have
merit
it
from
him
by
give
him
my
company
so
entirely
as
I
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
he
make
me
take
a
maid
,
and
keep
house
,
and
his
friend
that
come
with
him
to
Bath
be
go
,
he
oblige
me
to
diet
him
,
which
I
do
very
willingly
,
believe
,
as
it
appear
,
that
I
should
lose
nothing
by
it
,
nor
do
the
woman
of
the
house
fail
to
find
her
account
in
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
live
thus
near
three
month
,
when
the
company
begin
to
wear
away
at
the
Bath
,
he
talk
of
go
away
,
and
fain
he
would
have
me
to
go
to
London
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
very
easy
in
that
proposal
,
not
know
what
posture
<EOS>
I
be
to
live
in
there
,
or
how
he
may
use
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
while
this
be
in
debate
he
fall
very
sick
;
he
have
go
out
to
a
place
in
Somersetshire
,
call
Shepton
,
where
he
have
some
business
and
be
there
take
very
ill
,
and
so
ill
that
he
could
not
travel
;
so
he
send
his
man
back
to
Bath
,
to
beg
me
that
I
would
hire
a
coach
and
come
over
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
go
,
he
have
leave
all
his
money
and
other
thing
of
value
with
me
,
and
what
to
do
with
them
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
but
I
secure
them
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
lock
up
the
lodging
and
go
to
him
,
where
I
find
him
very
ill
indeed
;
however
,
I
persuade
him
to
be
carry
in
a
litter
to
the
Bath
,
where
there
be
more
help
and
well
advice
to
be
have
.
  
<EOS>
He
consent
,
and
I
bring
him
to
the
Bath
,
which
be
about
fifteen
mile
,
as
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
continue
very
ill
of
a
fever
,
and
keep
his
bed
five
week
,
all
which
time
I
nurse
him
and
tend
him
myself
,
as
much
and
as
carefully
as
if
I
have
be
his
wife
;
indeed
,
if
I
have
be
his
wife
I
could
not
have
do
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
up
with
him
so
much
and
so
often
,
that
at
last
,
indeed
,
he
would
not
let
me
sit
up
any
longer
,
and
then
I
get
a
pallet
-
bed
into
his
room
,
and
lie
in
it
just
at
his
bed
's
foot
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
sensibly
affected
with
his
condition
,
and
with
the
apprehension
of
lose
such
a
friend
as
he
be
,
and
be
like
to
be
to
me
,
and
I
use
to
sit
and
cry
by
him
many
hour
together
.
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
he
grow
well
,
and
give
hope
that
he
would
recover
,
as
indeed
he
do
,
though
very
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
otherwise
than
what
I
be
go
to
say
,
I
should
not
be
backward
to
disclose
it
,
as
it
be
apparent
I
have
do
in
other
case
in
this
account
;
but
I
affirm
,
that
through
all
this
conversation
,
abate
the
freedom
of
come
into
the
chamber
when
I
or
he
be
in
bed
,
and
abate
the
necessary
office
of
attend
him
night
and
day
when
he
be
sick
<EOS>
,
there
have
not
pass
the
least
immodest
word
or
action
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
oh
that
it
have
be
so
to
the
last
!
  
<EOS>
after
some
time
he
gather
strength
and
grow
well
apace
,
and
I
would
have
remove
my
pallet
-
bed
,
but
he
would
not
let
me
,
till
he
be
able
to
venture
himself
without
anybody
to
sit
up
with
him
,
and
then
I
remove
to
my
own
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
many
occasion
to
express
his
sense
of
my
tenderness
and
concern
for
him
;
and
when
he
grow
quite
well
,
he
make
me
a
present
of
fifty
guinea
for
my
care
and
,
as
he
call
it
,
for
hazard
my
life
to
save
his
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
he
make
deep
protestation
of
a
sincere
inviolable
affection
for
me
,
but
all
along
attest
it
to
be
with
the
utmost
reserve
for
my
virtue
and
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
fully
satisfied
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
it
that
length
that
he
protest
to
me
,
that
if
he
be
naked
in
bed
with
me
,
he
would
as
sacredly
preserve
my
virtue
as
he
would
defend
it
if
I
be
assault
by
a
ravisher
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
him
,
and
tell
him
I
do
so
;
but
this
do
not
satisfy
him
,
he
would
,
he
say
,
wait
for
some
opportunity
to
give
me
an
undoubted
testimony
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
while
after
this
that
I
have
occasion
,
on
my
own
business
,
to
go
to
Bristol
,
upon
which
he
hire
me
a
coach
,
and
would
go
with
me
,
and
do
so
;
and
now
indeed
our
intimacy
increase
.
 
<EOS>
from
Bristol
he
carry
me
to
Gloucester
,
which
be
merely
a
journey
of
pleasure
,
to
take
the
air
;
and
here
it
be
our
hap
to
have
no
lodging
in
the
inn
but
<EOS>
in
one
large
chamber
with
two
bed
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
house
go
up
with
us
to
show
his
room
,
and
come
into
that
room
,
say
very
frankly
to
him
,
"
Sir
,
it
be
none
of
my
business
to
inquire
whether
the
lady
be
your
spouse
or
no
,
but
if
not
,
you
may
lie
as
honestly
in
these
two
bed
as
if
you
be
in
two
chamber
,
"
and
with
that
he
pull
a
great
curtain
which
draw
quite
across
the
room
and
effectually
divide
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
my
friend
,
very
readily
,
"
these
bed
will
do
,
and
as
for
the
rest
,
we
be
too
near
akin
to
lie
together
,
though
we
may
lodge
near
one
another
"
;
and
this
put
an
honest
face
on
the
thing
too
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
go
to
bed
,
he
decently
go
out
of
the
room
till
I
be
in
bed
,
and
then
go
to
bed
in
the
bed
on
his
own
side
of
the
room
,
but
lie
there
talk
to
me
a
great
while
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
repeat
his
usual
saying
,
that
he
could
lie
naked
in
the
bed
with
me
and
not
offer
me
the
least
injury
,
he
start
out
of
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
shall
see
how
just
I
will
be
to
you
,
and
that
I
can
keep
my
word
,
"
and
away
he
come
to
my
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
resist
a
little
,
but
I
must
confess
I
should
not
have
resist
him
much
if
he
have
not
make
those
promise
at
all
;
so
after
a
little
struggle
,
as
I
say
,
I
lie
still
and
let
him
come
to
bed
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
there
he
take
me
in
his
arm
,
and
so
I
lay
all
night
with
him
,
but
he
have
no
more
to
do
with
me
,
or
offer
anything
to
me
,
other
than
embrace
me
,
as
I
say
,
in
his
arm
,
no
,
not
the
whole
night
,
but
rise
up
and
dress
him
in
the
morning
,
and
leave
me
as
innocent
for
him
as
I
be
the
day
I
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
surprising
thing
to
me
,
and
perhaps
may
be
so
to
other
,
who
know
how
the
law
of
nature
work
;
for
he
be
a
strong
,
vigorous
,
brisk
person
;
nor
do
he
act
thus
on
a
principle
of
religion
at
all
,
but
of
mere
affection
;
insist
on
it
,
that
though
I
be
to
him
to
most
agreeable
woman
in
the
world
,
yet
,
because
he
love
me
,
he
could
not
injure
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
own
it
be
a
noble
principle
,
but
as
it
be
what
I
never
understand
before
,
so
it
be
to
me
perfectly
amazing
.
 
<EOS>
We
travel
the
rest
of
the
journey
as
we
do
before
,
and
come
back
to
the
Bath
,
where
,
as
he
have
opportunity
to
come
to
me
when
he
would
,
he
often
repeat
the
moderation
,
and
I
frequently
lie
with
him
,
and
he
with
me
,
and
although
all
the
familiarity
between
man
and
wife
be
common
to
us
,
yet
he
never
once
offer
to
go
any
farther
,
and
he
value
himself
much
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
I
be
so
wholly
pleased
with
it
as
he
think
I
be
,
for
I
own
much
wickeder
than
he
,
as
you
shall
hear
presently
.
  
<EOS>
We
live
thus
near
two
year
,
only
with
this
exception
,
that
he
go
three
time
to
London
in
that
time
,
and
once
he
continue
there
four
month
;
but
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
always
supply
me
with
money
to
subsist
me
very
handsomely
.
  
<EOS>
have
we
continue
thus
<EOS>
,
I
confess
we
have
have
much
to
boast
of
;
but
as
wise
man
say
,
it
be
ill
venture
too
near
the
brink
of
a
command
,
so
we
find
it
;
and
here
again
I
must
do
him
the
justice
to
own
that
the
first
breach
be
not
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
night
that
we
be
in
bed
together
warm
and
merry
,
and
have
drunk
,
I
think
,
a
little
more
wine
that
night
,
both
of
us
,
than
usual
,
although
not
in
the
least
to
disorder
either
of
us
,
when
,
after
some
other
folly
which
I
can
not
name
,
and
be
clasp
close
in
his
arm
,
I
tell
him
(
I
repeat
it
with
shame
and
horror
of
soul
)
that
I
could
find
in
my
heart
to
discharge
him
of
his
engagement
for
one
night
and
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
me
at
my
word
immediately
,
and
after
that
there
be
no
resist
him
;
neither
indeed
have
I
any
mind
to
resist
him
any
more
,
let
what
would
come
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
government
of
our
virtue
be
break
,
and
I
exchange
the
place
of
friend
for
that
unmusical
,
harsh
-
sound
title
of
whore
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
we
be
both
at
our
penitential
;
I
cry
very
heartily
,
he
express
himself
very
sorry
;
but
that
be
all
either
of
us
could
do
at
that
time
,
and
the
way
be
thus
clear
,
and
the
bar
of
virtue
and
conscience
thus
remove
,
we
have
the
less
difficult
afterwards
to
struggle
with
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
dull
kind
of
conversation
that
we
have
together
for
all
the
rest
of
that
week
;
I
look
on
him
with
blush
,
and
every
now
and
then
start
that
melancholy
objection
,
"
what
if
I
should
be
with
child
now
?
 
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
me
then
?
"
<EOS>
He
encourage
me
by
tell
me
,
that
as
long
as
I
be
true
to
him
,
he
would
be
so
to
me
;
and
since
it
be
go
such
a
length
(
which
indeed
he
never
intend
)
,
yet
if
I
be
with
child
,
he
would
take
care
of
that
,
and
of
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
this
harden
us
both
.
<EOS>
I
assure
him
if
I
be
with
child
,
I
would
die
for
want
of
a
midwife
rather
than
name
him
as
the
father
of
it
;
and
he
assure
me
<EOS>
I
should
never
want
if
I
should
be
with
child
.
 
<EOS>
these
mutual
assurance
harden
us
in
the
thing
,
and
after
this
we
repeat
the
crime
as
often
as
we
please
,
till
at
length
,
as
I
have
fear
,
so
it
come
to
pass
,
and
I
be
indeed
with
child
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
be
sure
it
be
so
,
and
I
have
satisfy
him
of
it
too
,
we
begin
to
think
of
take
measure
for
the
managing
it
,
and
I
propose
trust
the
secret
to
my
landlady
,
and
ask
her
advice
,
which
he
agree
to
.
 
<EOS>
My
landlady
,
a
woman
<EOS>
(
as
I
find
)
use
to
such
thing
,
make
light
of
it
;
she
say
she
know
it
would
come
to
that
at
last
,
and
make
us
very
merry
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
say
above
,
we
find
her
an
experienced
old
lady
at
such
work
;
she
undertake
everything
,
engage
to
procure
a
midwife
and
a
nurse
,
to
satisfy
all
inquiry
,
and
bring
us
off
with
reputation
,
and
she
do
so
very
dexterously
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
grow
near
my
time
she
desire
my
gentleman
to
go
away
to
London
,
or
make
as
if
he
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
she
acquaint
the
parish
officer
that
there
be
a
lady
ready
to
lie
in
at
her
house
,
but
that
she
know
her
husband
very
well
,
and
give
them
,
as
she
pretend
,
an
account
of
his
name
,
which
she
call
Sir
Walter
Cleve
;
tell
them
he
be
a
very
worthy
gentleman
,
and
that
she
would
answer
for
all
inquiry
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
this
satisfy
the
parish
officer
presently
,
and
I
lie
in
with
as
much
credit
as
I
could
have
do
if
I
have
really
be
my
Lady
Cleve
,
and
be
assist
in
my
travail
by
three
or
four
of
the
good
citizen
'
wife
of
Bath
who
live
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
,
however
,
make
me
a
little
the
more
expensive
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
often
express
my
concern
to
him
about
it
,
but
he
bid
me
not
be
concern
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
have
furnish
me
very
sufficiently
with
money
for
the
extraordinary
expense
of
my
lying
in
,
I
have
everything
very
handsome
about
me
,
but
do
not
affect
to
be
gay
or
extravagant
neither
;
besides
,
know
my
own
circumstance
,
and
know
the
world
as
I
have
do
,
and
that
such
kind
of
thing
do
not
often
last
long
,
I
take
care
to
lay
up
as
much
money
as
I
could
for
a
wet
day
,
as
I
call
it
;
make
him
believe
it
be
all
spend
upon
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
thing
in
my
lying
in
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
mean
,
and
include
what
he
have
give
me
as
above
,
I
have
at
the
end
of
my
lying
in
about
two
hundred
guinea
by
me
,
include
also
what
be
leave
of
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
bring
to
bed
of
a
fine
boy
indeed
,
and
a
charming
child
it
be
;
and
when
he
hear
of
it
he
write
me
a
very
kind
,
obliging
letter
about
it
,
and
then
tell
me
,
he
think
it
would
look
well
for
me
to
come
away
for
London
as
soon
as
I
be
up
and
well
;
that
he
have
provide
apartment
for
me
at
Hammersmith
,
as
if
I
come
thither
only
from
London
;
and
that
after
a
little
while
I
should
go
back
to
the
Bath
,
and
he
would
go
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
like
this
offer
very
well
,
and
accordingly
hire
a
coach
on
purpose
,
and
take
my
child
,
and
a
wet
-
nurse
to
tend
and
suckle
it
,
and
a
maid
-
servant
with
me
,
away
<EOS>
I
go
for
London
.
  
<EOS>
He
meet
me
at
read
in
his
own
chariot
,
and
take
me
into
that
,
leave
the
servant
and
the
child
in
the
hire
coach
,
and
so
he
bring
me
to
my
new
lodging
at
Hammersmith
;
with
which
I
have
abundance
of
reason
to
be
very
well
pleased
,
for
they
be
very
handsome
room
,
and
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
accommodate
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
indeed
in
the
height
of
what
I
may
call
my
prosperity
,
and
I
want
nothing
but
to
be
a
wife
,
which
,
however
,
could
not
be
in
this
case
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
room
for
it
;
and
therefore
on
all
occasion
I
study
to
save
what
I
could
,
as
I
have
say
above
,
against
a
time
of
scarcity
,
know
well
enough
that
such
thing
as
these
do
not
always
continue
;
that
man
that
keep
mistress
often
change
them
,
grow
weary
of
them
,
or
jealous
of
them
,
or
something
or
other
happen
to
make
them
withdraw
their
bounty
;
and
sometimes
the
lady
that
be
thus
well
use
be
not
careful
by
a
prudent
conduct
to
preserve
the
esteem
of
their
person
,
or
the
nice
article
of
their
fidelity
,
and
then
they
be
justly
cast
off
with
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
secure
in
this
point
,
for
as
I
have
no
inclination
to
change
,
so
I
have
no
manner
of
acquaintance
in
the
whole
house
,
and
so
no
temptation
to
look
any
farther
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
no
company
but
in
the
family
when
I
lodge
,
and
with
the
clergyman
's
lady
at
next
door
;
so
that
when
he
be
absent
I
visit
nobody
,
nor
do
he
ever
find
me
out
of
my
chamber
or
parlour
<EOS>
whenever
he
come
down
;
if
I
go
anywhere
to
take
the
air
,
it
be
always
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
living
in
this
manner
with
him
,
and
his
with
me
,
be
certainly
the
most
undesigned
thing
in
the
world
;
he
often
protest
to
me
,
that
when
he
become
first
acquaint
with
me
,
and
even
to
the
very
night
when
we
first
break
in
upon
our
rule
,
he
never
have
the
least
design
of
lie
with
me
;
that
he
always
have
a
sincere
affection
for
me
,
but
not
the
least
real
inclination
to
do
what
he
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
I
never
suspect
him
;
that
if
I
have
I
should
not
so
easily
have
yield
to
the
freedom
which
bring
it
on
,
but
that
it
be
all
a
surprise
,
and
be
owe
to
the
accident
of
our
have
yield
too
far
to
our
mutual
inclination
that
night
;
and
indeed
I
have
often
observe
since
,
and
leave
it
as
a
caution
to
the
reader
of
this
story
,
that
we
ought
to
be
cautious
of
gratify
our
inclination
in
loose
and
lewd
freedom
,
lest
we
find
our
resolution
of
virtue
fail
us
in
the
junction
when
their
assistance
should
be
most
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
and
I
have
confess
it
before
,
that
from
the
first
hour
I
begin
to
converse
with
him
<EOS>
,
I
resolve
to
let
him
lie
with
me
,
if
he
offer
it
;
but
it
be
because
I
want
his
help
and
assistance
,
and
I
know
no
other
way
of
secure
him
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
be
that
night
together
,
and
,
as
I
have
say
,
have
go
such
a
length
<EOS>
,
I
find
my
weakness
;
the
inclination
be
not
to
be
resist
,
but
I
be
oblige
to
yield
up
all
even
before
he
ask
it
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
so
just
to
me
that
he
never
upbraid
me
with
that
;
nor
do
he
ever
express
the
least
dislike
of
my
conduct
on
any
other
occasion
,
but
always
protest
he
be
as
much
delighted
with
my
company
as
he
be
the
first
hour
we
come
together
:
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
come
together
as
bedfellow
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
have
no
wife
,
that
be
to
say
,
she
be
as
no
wife
to
him
,
and
so
I
be
in
no
danger
that
way
,
but
the
just
reflection
of
conscience
oftentime
snatch
a
man
,
especially
a
man
of
sense
,
from
the
arm
of
a
mistress
,
as
it
do
him
at
last
,
though
on
another
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
though
I
be
not
without
secret
reproach
of
my
own
conscience
for
the
life
I
lead
,
and
that
even
in
the
great
height
of
the
satisfaction
I
ever
take
,
yet
I
 
have
the
terrible
prospect
of
poverty
and
starving
,
which
lie
on
me
as
a
frightful
spectre
,
so
that
there
be
no
look
behind
me
.
<EOS>
but
as
poverty
bring
me
into
it
,
so
fear
of
poverty
keep
me
in
it
,
and
I
frequently
resolve
to
leave
it
quite
off
,
if
I
could
but
come
to
lay
up
money
enough
to
maintain
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
be
thought
of
no
weight
,
and
whenever
he
come
to
me
they
vanish
;
for
his
company
be
so
delightful
,
that
there
be
no
be
melancholy
<EOS>
when
he
be
there
;
the
reflection
be
all
the
subject
of
those
hour
when
I
be
alone
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
six
year
in
this
happy
but
unhappy
condition
,
in
which
time
I
bring
him
three
child
,
but
only
the
first
of
them
live
;
and
though
I
remove
twice
in
those
six
year
,
yet
I
come
 
back
the
sixth
year
to
my
first
lodging
at
Hammersmith
.
<EOS>
here
it
be
that
I
be
one
morning
surprised
with
a
kind
but
melancholy
letter
from
my
gentleman
,
intimate
that
he
be
very
ill
,
and
be
afraid
he
should
have
another
fit
of
sickness
,
but
that
his
wife
's
relation
be
in
the
house
with
him
,
it
would
not
be
practicable
to
have
me
with
him
,
which
,
however
,
he
express
his
great
dissatisfaction
in
,
and
that
he
wish
I
could
be
allow
to
tend
and
nurse
him
as
I
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
concerned
at
this
account
,
and
be
very
impatient
to
know
how
it
be
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
wait
a
fortnight
or
thereabout
,
and
hear
nothing
,
which
surprise
me
,
and
I
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
I
may
say
,
that
for
the
next
fortnight
I
be
near
to
distract
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
particular
difficulty
that
I
do
not
know
directly
where
he
be
;
for
I
understand
at
first
he
be
in
the
lodging
of
his
wife
's
mother
;
but
have
remove
myself
to
London
,
I
soon
find
,
by
the
help
of
the
direction
I
have
for
write
my
letter
to
him
,
how
to
inquire
after
him
,
and
there
I
find
that
he
be
at
a
house
in
Bloomsbury
,
whither
he
have
,
a
little
before
he
fall
sick
,
remove
his
whole
family
;
and
that
his
wife
and
wife
's
mother
be
in
the
same
house
,
though
the
wife
be
not
suffer
to
know
that
she
be
in
the
same
house
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
also
soon
understand
that
he
be
at
the
last
extremity
,
which
make
me
almost
at
the
last
extremity
too
,
to
have
a
true
account
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
I
have
the
curiosity
to
disguise
myself
like
a
servant
-
maid
,
in
a
round
cap
and
straw
hat
,
and
go
to
the
door
,
as
send
by
a
lady
of
his
neighbourhood
,
where
he
live
before
,
and
give
master
and
mistress
's
service
<EOS>
,
I
say
I
be
send
to
know
how
Mr.
#
#
#
#
 
do
,
and
how
he
have
rest
that
night
.
<EOS>
in
deliver
this
message
I
get
the
opportunity
I
desire
;
for
,
speak
with
one
of
the
maid
,
I
hold
a
long
gossip
's
tale
with
her
,
and
have
all
the
particular
of
his
illness
,
which
I
find
be
a
pleurisy
,
attend
with
a
cough
and
a
fever
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
also
who
be
in
the
house
,
and
how
his
wife
be
,
who
,
by
her
relation
,
they
be
in
some
hope
may
recover
her
understanding
;
but
as
to
the
gentleman
himself
,
in
short
she
tell
me
the
doctor
say
there
be
very
little
hope
of
him
,
that
in
the
morning
they
think
he
have
be
die
,
and
that
he
be
but
little
well
then
,
for
they
do
not
expect
that
he
could
live
over
the
next
night
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
heavy
news
for
me
,
and
I
begin
now
to
see
an
end
of
my
prosperity
,
and
to
see
also
that
it
be
very
well
<EOS>
I
have
play
to
good
housewife
,
and
secure
or
save
something
while
he
be
alive
,
for
that
now
I
have
no
view
of
my
own
living
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
lie
very
heavy
upon
my
mind
,
too
,
that
I
have
a
son
,
a
fine
lovely
boy
,
about
five
year
old
,
and
no
provision
make
for
it
,
at
least
that
I
know
of
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
consideration
,
and
a
sad
heart
,
I
go
home
that
evening
,
and
begin
to
cast
with
myself
how
I
should
live
,
and
in
what
manner
to
bestow
myself
,
for
the
residue
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
could
not
rest
without
inquire
again
very
quickly
what
be
become
of
him
;
and
not
venture
to
go
myself
,
I
send
several
sham
messenger
,
till
after
a
fortnight
's
waiting
longer
,
I
find
that
there
be
hope
of
his
life
,
though
he
be
still
very
ill
;
then
I
abate
my
send
any
more
to
the
house
,
and
in
some
time
after
I
learn
in
the
neighbourhood
that
he
be
about
house
,
and
then
that
he
be
abroad
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
then
but
that
I
should
soon
hear
of
him
,
and
begin
to
comfort
myself
with
my
circumstance
be
,
as
I
think
,
recover
.
<EOS>
I
wait
a
week
,
and
two
week
,
and
with
much
surprise
and
amazement
I
wait
near
two
month
and
hear
nothing
,
but
that
,
be
recover
,
he
be
go
into
the
country
for
the
air
,
and
for
the
well
recovery
after
his
distemper
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
it
be
yet
two
month
more
,
and
then
I
understand
he
be
come
to
his
city
house
again
,
but
still
I
hear
nothing
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
write
several
letter
for
him
,
and
direct
them
as
usual
,
and
find
two
or
three
of
them
have
be
call
for
,
but
not
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
again
in
a
more
pressing
manner
than
ever
,
and
in
one
of
them
let
him
know
,
that
I
must
be
force
to
wait
on
him
myself
,
represent
my
circumstance
,
the
rent
of
lodging
to
pay
,
and
the
provision
for
the
child
want
,
and
my
own
deplorable
condition
,
destitute
of
subsistence
for
his
most
solemn
engagement
to
take
care
of
and
provide
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
copy
of
this
letter
,
and
find
it
lie
at
the
house
near
a
month
and
be
not
call
for
,
I
find
mean
to
have
the
copy
of
it
put
into
his
own
hand
at
a
coffee
-
house
,
where
I
have
by
inquiry
<EOS>
find
he
use
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
this
letter
force
an
answer
from
him
,
by
which
,
though
I
find
I
be
to
be
abandon
,
yet
I
find
he
have
send
a
letter
to
me
some
time
before
,
desire
me
to
go
down
to
the
Bath
again
.
 
<EOS>
Its
content
I
shall
come
to
presently
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
sick
-
bed
be
the
time
when
such
correspondence
as
this
be
look
on
with
different
countenance
,
and
see
with
other
eye
than
we
see
them
with
,
or
than
they
appear
with
before
.
 
<EOS>
My
lover
have
be
at
the
gate
of
death
,
and
at
the
very
brink
of
eternity
;
and
,
it
seem
,
have
be
strike
with
a
due
remorse
,
and
with
sad
reflection
upon
his
past
life
of
gallantry
and
levity
;
and
among
the
rest
,
criminal
correspondence
with
me
,
which
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
long
-
continue
life
of
adultery
,
and
represent
itself
as
it
really
be
,
not
as
it
have
be
formerly
think
by
him
to
be
,
and
he
look
upon
it
now
with
a
just
and
religious
abhorrence
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
observe
also
,
and
leave
it
for
the
direction
of
my
sex
in
such
case
of
pleasure
,
that
whenever
sincere
repentance
succeed
such
a
crime
as
this
,
there
never
fail
to
attend
a
hatred
of
the
object
;
and
the
more
the
affection
may
seem
to
be
before
,
the
hatred
will
be
the
more
in
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
always
be
so
,
indeed
it
can
be
no
otherwise
;
for
there
can
not
be
a
true
and
sincere
abhorrence
of
the
offence
,
and
the
love
to
the
cause
of
it
remain
;
there
will
,
with
an
abhorrence
of
the
sin
,
be
find
a
detestation
of
the
fellow
-
sinner
;
you
can
expect
no
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
it
so
here
,
though
good
manner
and
justice
in
this
gentleman
keep
him
from
carry
it
on
to
any
extreme
but
<EOS>
the
short
history
of
his
part
in
this
affair
be
thus
:
 
he
perceive
by
my
last
letter
,
and
by
all
the
rest
,
which
he
go
for
after
,
that
I
be
not
go
to
Bath
,
that
his
first
letter
have
not
come
to
my
hand
;
upon
which
he
write
me
this
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
MADAM
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
that
my
letter
,
date
the
8th
of
last
month
,
do
not
come
to
your
hand
;
I
give
you
my
word
it
be
deliver
at
your
lodging
,
and
to
the
hand
of
your
maid
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
acquaint
you
with
what
have
be
my
condition
for
some
time
past
;
and
how
,
have
be
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
,
I
be
,
by
the
unexpected
and
undeserved
mercy
of
Heaven
,
restore
again
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
condition
I
have
be
in
,
it
can
not
be
strange
to
you
that
our
unhappy
correspondence
have
not
be
the
least
of
the
burthen
which
lie
upon
my
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
say
no
more
;
those
thing
that
must
be
repent
of
,
must
be
also
reform
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
think
of
go
back
to
the
Bath
.
 
<EOS>
I
enclose
you
here
a
bill
for
#
#
#
#
50
for
clear
yourself
at
your
lodging
,
and
carry
you
down
,
and
hope
it
will
be
no
surprise
to
you
to
add
,
that
on
this
account
only
,
and
not
for
any
offence
give
me
on
your
side
,
I
can
see
you
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
due
care
of
the
child
;
leave
him
where
he
be
,
or
take
him
with
you
,
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
the
like
reflection
,
and
that
they
may
be
to
your
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
"
etc
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
strike
with
this
letter
as
with
a
thousand
wound
,
such
as
I
can
not
describe
;
the
reproach
of
my
own
conscience
be
such
as
I
can
not
express
,
for
I
be
not
blind
to
my
own
crime
;
and
I
reflect
that
I
may
with
less
offence
have
continue
with
my
brother
,
and
live
with
him
as
a
wife
,
since
there
be
 
no
crime
in
our
marriage
on
that
score
,
neither
of
us
know
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
never
once
reflect
that
I
be
all
this
while
a
married
woman
,
a
wife
to
Mr.
#
#
#
#
 
the
linen
-
draper
,
who
,
though
he
have
leave
me
by
the
necessity
of
his
circumstance
,
have
no
power
to
discharge
me
from
the
marriage
contract
which
be
between
us
,
or
to
give
me
a
legal
liberty
to
marry
again
;
so
that
I
have
be
no
less
than
a
whore
and
an
adulteress
all
this
while
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
reproach
myself
with
the
liberty
I
have
take
,
and
how
I
have
be
a
snare
to
this
gentleman
,
and
that
indeed
I
be
principal
in
the
crime
;
that
now
he
be
mercifully
snatch
out
of
the
gulf
by
a
convincing
work
upon
his
mind
,
but
that
I
be
leave
as
if
I
be
forsake
of
God
's
grace
,
and
abandon
by
Heaven
to
a
continuing
in
my
wickedness
.
  
<EOS>
under
these
reflection
I
continue
very
pensive
and
sad
for
near
month
,
and
do
not
go
down
to
the
Bath
,
have
no
inclination
to
be
with
the
woman
whom
I
be
with
before
;
l
,
as
I
think
,
she
should
prompt
me
to
some
wicked
course
of
life
again
,
as
she
have
do
;
and
besides
,
I
be
very
loth
<EOS>
she
should
know
I
be
cast
off
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
greatly
perplex
about
my
little
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
death
to
me
to
part
with
the
child
,
and
yet
when
I
consider
the
danger
of
be
one
time
or
other
left
with
him
to
keep
without
a
maintenance
to
support
him
,
I
then
resolve
to
leave
him
where
he
be
;
but
then
I
conclude
also
to
be
near
him
myself
too
,
that
I
then
may
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
him
,
without
the
care
of
provide
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
send
my
gentleman
a
short
letter
,
therefore
,
that
I
have
obey
his
order
in
all
thing
but
that
of
go
back
to
the
Bath
,
which
I
could
not
think
of
for
many
reason
;
that
however
part
from
him
be
a
wound
to
me
that
I
could
never
recover
,
yet
that
I
be
fully
satisfied
<EOS>
his
reflection
be
just
,
and
would
be
very
far
from
desire
to
obstruct
his
reformation
or
repentance
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
represent
my
own
circumstance
to
him
in
the
most
moving
term
that
I
be
able
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
those
unhappy
distress
which
first
move
him
to
a
generous
and
an
honest
friendship
for
me
,
would
,
I
hope
,
move
him
to
a
little
concern
for
me
now
,
though
the
criminal
part
of
our
correspondence
,
which
I
believe
neither
of
us
intend
to
fall
into
at
the
time
,
be
break
off
;
that
I
desire
to
repent
as
sincerely
as
he
have
do
,
but
entreat
him
to
put
me
in
some
condition
that
I
may
not
be
expose
to
the
temptation
which
the
devil
never
fail
to
excite
us
to
from
the
frightful
prospect
of
poverty
and
distress
;
and
if
he
have
the
least
apprehension
of
my
be
troublesome
to
him
,
I
beg
he
would
put
me
in
a
posture
to
go
back
to
my
mother
in
Virginia
,
from
when
he
know
I
come
,
and
that
would
put
an
end
to
all
his
fear
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
I
conclude
,
that
if
he
would
send
me
#
#
#
#
50
more
to
facilitate
my
go
away
,
I
would
send
him
back
a
general
release
,
and
would
promise
never
to
disturb
him
more
with
any
importunity
;
unless
it
be
to
hear
of
the
well
-
doing
of
the
child
,
whom
,
if
I
find
my
mother
live
and
my
circumstance
able
,
I
would
send
for
to
come
over
to
me
,
and
take
him
also
effectually
off
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
all
a
cheat
thus
far
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
I
have
no
intention
to
go
to
Virginia
,
as
the
account
of
my
former
affair
there
may
convince
anybody
of
;
but
the
business
be
to
get
this
last
#
#
#
#
50
of
him
,
if
possible
,
know
well
enough
it
would
be
the
last
penny
I
be
ever
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
argument
I
use
,
namely
,
of
give
him
a
general
release
,
and
never
trouble
him
any
more
,
prevail
effectually
with
him
,
and
he
send
me
a
bill
for
the
money
by
a
person
who
bring
with
him
a
general
release
for
me
to
sign
,
and
which
I
frankly
sign
,
and
receive
the
money
;
and
thus
,
though
full
sore
against
my
will
,
a
final
end
be
put
to
this
affair
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
can
not
but
reflect
upon
the
unhappy
consequence
of
too
great
freedom
between
person
state
as
we
be
,
upon
the
pretence
of
innocent
intention
,
love
of
friendship
,
and
the
like
;
for
the
flesh
have
generally
so
great
a
share
in
those
friendship
,
that
be
great
odd
but
<EOS>
inclination
prevail
at
last
over
the
most
solemn
resolution
;
and
that
vice
break
in
at
the
breach
of
decency
,
which
really
innocent
friendship
ought
to
preserve
with
the
great
strictness
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
leave
the
reader
of
these
thing
to
their
own
just
reflection
,
which
they
will
be
more
able
to
make
effectual
than
I
,
who
so
soon
forget
myself
,
and
be
therefore
but
a
very
indifferent
monitor
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
a
single
person
again
,
as
I
may
call
myself
;
I
be
loose
from
all
the
obligation
either
of
wedlock
or
mistress
-
ship
in
the
world
,
except
my
husband
<EOS>
the
linen
-
draper
,
whom
,
I
have
not
now
hear
from
in
almost
fifteen
year
<EOS>
,
nobody
could
blame
me
for
think
myself
entirely
free
from
;
see
also
he
have
at
his
go
away
tell
me
,
that
if
I
do
not
hear
frequently
from
him
,
I
should
conclude
he
be
dead
,
and
I
may
freely
marry
again
to
whom
I
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
cast
up
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
by
many
letter
and
much
importunity
,
and
with
the
intercession
of
my
mother
too
,
have
a
second
return
of
some
good
from
my
brother
(
as
I
now
call
him
)
in
Virginia
,
to
make
up
the
damage
of
the
cargo
I
bring
away
with
me
,
and
this
too
be
upon
the
condition
of
my
seal
a
general
release
to
him
,
and
to
send
it
him
by
his
correspondent
at
Bristol
,
which
,
though
I
think
hard
of
,
yet
I
be
oblige
to
promise
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
manage
so
well
in
this
case
,
that
I
get
my
good
away
before
the
release
be
sign
,
and
then
I
always
find
something
or
other
to
say
to
evade
the
thing
,
and
to
put
off
the
signing
it
at
all
;
till
at
length
I
pretend
I
must
write
to
my
brother
,
and
have
his
answer
,
before
I
could
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
include
this
recruit
,
and
before
I
get
the
last
#
#
#
#
50
,
I
find
my
strength
to
amount
,
put
all
together
,
to
about
#
#
#
#
400
,
so
that
with
that
I
have
about
#
#
#
#
450
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
save
above
#
#
#
#
100
more
,
but
I
meet
with
a
disaster
with
that
,
which
be
this
 
that
a
goldsmith
in
whose
hand
I
have
trust
it
,
break
,
so
I
lose
#
#
#
#
70
of
my
money
,
the
man
's
composition
not
make
above
#
#
#
#
30
out
of
his
#
#
#
#
100
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
plate
,
but
not
much
,
and
be
well
enough
stock
with
clothe
and
linen
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
stock
I
have
the
world
to
begin
again
;
but
you
be
to
consider
that
I
be
not
now
the
same
woman
as
when
I
live
at
Redriff
;
for
,
first
of
all
,
I
be
near
twenty
year
old
,
and
do
not
look
the
well
for
my
age
,
nor
for
my
ramble
to
Virginia
and
back
again
;
and
though
I
omit
nothing
that
may
set
me
out
to
advantage
,
except
painting
,
for
that
I
never
stoop
to
,
and
have
pride
enough
to
think
I
do
not
want
it
,
yet
there
would
always
be
some
difference
see
between
five
-
and
-
twenty
and
two
-
and
-
forty
.
  
<EOS>
I
cast
about
innumerable
way
for
my
future
state
of
life
,
and
begin
to
consider
very
seriously
what
I
should
do
,
but
nothing
offer
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
care
to
make
the
world
take
me
for
something
more
than
I
be
,
and
have
it
give
out
that
I
be
a
fortune
,
and
that
my
estate
be
in
my
own
hand
;
the
last
of
which
be
very
true
,
the
first
of
it
be
as
above
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
acquaintance
,
which
be
one
of
my
bad
misfortune
,
and
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
that
be
,
I
have
no
adviser
,
at
least
who
could
assist
and
advise
together
;
and
above
all
,
I
have
nobody
to
whom
I
could
in
 
confidence
commit
the
secret
of
my
circumstance
to
,
and
could
depend
upon
for
their
secrecy
and
fidelity
;
and
I
find
by
experience
,
that
to
be
friendless
in
the
bad
condition
,
next
to
be
in
want
that
a
woman
can
be
reduce
to
:
 
<EOS>
I
say
a
woman
,
because
'
tis
evident
man
can
be
their
own
adviser
,
and
their
own
director
,
and
know
how
to
work
themselves
out
of
difficulty
and
into
business
well
than
woman
;
but
if
a
woman
have
no
friend
to
communicate
her
affair
to
,
and
to
advise
and
assist
her
,
'
tis
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
she
be
undone
;
nay
,
and
the
more
money
she
have
,
the
more
danger
she
be
in
of
be
wrong
and
deceive
;
and
this
be
my
case
in
the
affair
of
the
#
#
#
#
100
which
I
leave
in
the
hand
of
the
goldsmith
,
as
above
,
whose
credit
,
it
seem
,
be
upon
the
ebb
before
,
but
I
,
that
have
no
knowledge
of
thing
and
nobody
to
consult
with
,
know
nothing
of
it
,
and
so
lose
my
money
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
when
a
woman
be
thus
leave
desolate
and
void
of
counsel
,
she
be
just
like
a
bag
of
money
or
a
jewel
drop
on
the
highway
,
which
be
a
prey
to
the
next
comer
;
if
a
man
of
virtue
and
upright
principle
happen
to
find
it
,
he
will
have
it
cry
,
and
the
owner
may
come
to
hear
of
it
again
;
but
how
many
time
shall
such
a
thing
fall
into
hand
that
will
make
no
scruple
of
seize
it
for
their
own
,
to
once
that
it
shall
come
into
good
hand
?
  
<EOS>
this
be
evidently
my
case
,
for
I
be
now
a
loose
,
unguided
creature
,
and
have
no
help
,
no
assistance
,
no
guide
for
my
conduct
;
I
know
what
I
aim
at
and
what
I
want
,
but
know
nothing
how
to
pursue
the
end
by
direct
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
place
in
a
settle
state
of
living
,
and
have
I
happen
to
meet
with
a
sober
,
good
husband
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
be
as
faithful
and
true
a
wife
to
him
as
virtue
itself
could
have
form
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
otherwise
,
the
vice
come
in
always
at
the
door
of
necessity
,
not
at
the
door
of
inclination
;
and
I
understand
too
well
,
by
the
want
of
it
,
what
the
value
of
a
settle
life
be
,
to
do
anything
to
forfeit
the
felicity
of
it
;
nay
,
I
should
have
make
the
well
wife
for
all
the
difficulty
I
have
pass
through
,
by
a
great
deal
;
nor
do
I
in
any
of
the
time
that
I
have
be
a
wife
give
my
husband
the
least
uneasiness
on
account
of
my
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
nothing
;
I
find
no
encourage
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
I
wait
;
I
live
regularly
,
and
with
as
much
frugality
as
become
my
circumstance
,
but
nothing
offer
,
nothing
present
,
and
the
main
stock
waste
apace
.
 
<EOS>
what
to
do
<EOS>
I
know
not
;
the
terror
of
approach
poverty
lie
hard
upon
my
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
some
money
,
but
where
to
place
it
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
nor
would
the
interest
of
it
maintain
me
,
at
least
not
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
a
new
scene
open
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
in
the
house
where
I
lodge
a
north
-
country
woman
that
go
for
a
gentlewoman
,
and
nothing
be
more
frequent
in
her
discourse
than
her
account
of
the
cheapness
of
provision
,
and
the
easy
way
of
live
in
her
country
;
how
plentiful
and
how
cheap
everything
be
,
what
good
company
they
keep
,
and
the
like
;
till
at
last
I
tell
her
she
almost
tempt
me
to
go
and
live
in
her
country
;
for
I
that
be
a
widow
,
though
I
have
sufficient
to
live
on
,
yet
have
no
way
of
increase
it
;
and
that
I
find
I
could
not
live
here
under
#
#
#
#
100
a
year
,
unless
I
keep
no
company
,
no
servant
,
make
no
appearance
,
and
bury
myself
in
privacy
,
as
if
I
be
oblige
to
it
by
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
observe
,
that
she
be
always
make
to
believe
,
as
everybody
else
be
,
that
I
be
a
great
fortune
,
or
at
least
that
I
have
three
or
four
thousand
pound
,
if
not
more
,
and
all
in
my
own
hand
;
and
she
be
mighty
sweet
upon
me
when
she
think
me
inclined
in
the
least
to
go
into
her
country
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
have
a
sister
live
near
Liverpool
,
that
her
brother
be
a
considerable
gentleman
there
,
and
have
a
great
estate
also
in
Ireland
;
that
she
would
go
down
there
in
about
two
month
,
and
if
I
would
give
her
my
company
thither
,
I
should
be
as
welcome
as
herself
for
a
month
or
more
as
I
please
,
till
I
should
see
how
I
like
the
country
;
and
if
I
think
fit
to
live
there
,
she
would
undertake
they
would
take
care
,
though
they
do
not
entertain
lodger
themselves
,
they
would
recommend
me
to
some
agreeable
family
,
where
I
should
be
place
to
my
content
.
  
<EOS>
if
this
woman
have
know
my
real
circumstance
,
she
would
never
have
lay
so
many
snare
,
and
take
so
many
weary
step
to
catch
a
poor
desolate
creature
that
be
good
for
little
when
it
be
catch
;
and
indeed
I
,
whose
case
be
almost
desperate
,
and
think
I
could
not
be
much
bad
,
be
not
very
anxious
about
what
may
befall
me
,
provide
they
do
me
no
personal
injury
;
so
I
suffer
myself
,
though
not
without
a
great
deal
of
invitation
and
great
profession
of
sincere
friendship
and
real
kindness
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
suffer
myself
to
be
prevail
upon
to
go
with
her
,
and
accordingly
I
pack
up
my
baggage
,
and
put
myself
in
a
posture
for
a
journey
,
though
I
do
not
absolutely
know
whither
I
be
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
find
myself
in
great
distress
;
what
little
I
have
in
the
world
be
all
in
money
,
except
as
before
,
a
little
plate
,
some
linen
,
and
my
clothe
;
as
for
my
household
stuff
,
I
have
little
or
none
,
for
I
have
live
always
in
lodging
;
but
I
have
not
one
friend
in
the
world
with
whom
to
trust
that
little
I
have
,
or
to
direct
me
how
to
dispose
of
it
,
and
this
perplex
me
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
bank
,
and
of
the
other
company
in
London
,
but
I
have
no
friend
to
commit
the
management
of
it
to
,
and
keep
and
carry
about
with
me
bank
bill
,
tally
,
order
,
and
such
thing
<EOS>
,
I
look
upon
at
as
unsafe
;
that
if
they
be
lose
,
my
money
be
lose
,
and
then
I
be
undone
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
I
may
be
rob
and
perhaps
murder
in
a
strange
place
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
perplex
me
strangely
,
and
what
to
do
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
in
my
thought
one
morning
that
I
would
go
to
the
bank
myself
,
where
I
have
often
be
to
receive
the
interest
of
some
bill
I
have
,
which
have
interest
payable
on
them
,
and
where
I
have
find
a
clerk
,
to
whom
I
apply
myself
,
very
honest
and
just
to
me
,
and
particularly
so
fair
one
time
that
when
I
have
mistold
my
money
,
and
take
less
than
my
due
,
and
be
come
away
,
he
set
me
to
right
and
give
me
the
rest
,
which
he
may
have
put
into
his
own
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
him
and
represent
my
case
very
plainly
,
and
ask
if
he
would
trouble
himself
to
be
my
adviser
,
who
be
a
poor
friendless
widow
,
and
know
not
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
if
I
desire
his
opinion
of
anything
within
the
reach
of
his
business
,
he
would
do
his
endeavour
that
I
should
not
be
wrong
,
but
that
he
would
also
help
me
to
a
good
sober
person
who
be
a
grave
man
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
be
a
clerk
in
such
business
too
,
though
not
in
their
house
,
whose
judgment
be
good
,
and
whose
honesty
I
may
depend
upon
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
,
"
add
he
,
"
I
will
answer
for
him
,
and
for
every
step
he
take
;
if
he
wrong
you
,
madam
,
of
one
farthing
,
it
shall
lie
at
my
door
,
I
will
make
it
good
;
and
he
delight
to
assist
people
in
such
case
 
<EOS>
he
do
it
as
an
act
of
charity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
at
a
stand
in
this
discourse
;
but
after
some
pause
I
tell
him
I
have
rather
have
depend
upon
him
,
because
I
have
find
him
honest
,
but
if
that
could
not
be
,
I
would
take
his
recommendation
sooner
than
any
one
be
else
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
you
will
be
as
well
satisfied
with
my
friend
as
with
me
,
and
he
be
thoroughly
able
to
assist
you
,
which
I
be
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
seem
he
have
his
hand
full
of
the
business
of
the
bank
,
and
have
engage
to
meddle
with
no
other
business
that
that
of
his
office
,
which
I
hear
afterwards
,
but
do
not
understand
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
add
,
that
his
friend
should
take
nothing
of
me
for
his
advice
or
assistance
,
and
this
indeed
encourage
me
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
He
appoint
the
same
evening
,
after
the
bank
be
shut
and
business
over
,
for
me
to
meet
him
and
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
as
soon
as
I
see
his
friend
,
and
he
begin
but
to
talk
of
the
affair
<EOS>
,
I
be
fully
satisfied
that
I
have
a
very
honest
man
to
deal
with
;
his
countenance
speak
it
,
and
his
character
,
as
I
hear
afterwards
,
be
everywhere
so
good
,
that
I
have
no
room
for
any
more
 
doubt
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
first
meeting
,
in
which
I
only
say
what
I
have
say
before
,
we
part
,
and
he
appoint
me
to
come
the
next
day
to
him
,
tell
me
I
may
in
the
meantime
satisfy
myself
of
him
by
inquiry
,
which
,
however
,
I
know
not
how
well
to
do
,
have
no
acquaintance
myself
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
I
meet
him
the
next
day
,
when
I
enter
more
freely
with
him
into
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
my
circumstance
at
large
:
 
that
I
be
a
widow
come
over
from
American
,
perfectly
desolate
and
friendless
;
that
I
have
a
little
money
,
and
but
a
little
,
and
be
almost
distract
for
fear
of
lose
it
,
have
no
friend
in
the
world
to
trust
with
the
management
of
it
;
that
I
be
go
into
the
north
of
England
to
live
cheap
,
that
my
stock
may
not
waste
;
that
I
would
willingly
lodge
my
money
in
the
bank
,
but
that
I
durst
not
carry
the
bill
about
me
,
and
the
like
,
as
above
;
and
how
to
correspond
about
it
,
or
with
whom
,
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
may
lodge
the
money
in
the
bank
as
an
account
,
and
its
being
enter
into
the
book
would
entitle
me
to
the
money
at
any
time
,
and
if
I
be
in
the
north
I
may
draw
bill
on
the
cashier
and
receive
it
when
I
would
;
but
that
then
it
would
be
esteem
as
run
cash
,
and
the
bank
would
give
no
interest
for
it
;
that
I
may
buy
stock
with
it
,
and
so
it
would
lie
in
store
for
me
,
but
that
then
if
I
want
to
dispose
if
it
,
I
must
come
up
to
town
on
purpose
to
transfer
it
,
and
even
it
would
be
with
some
difficulty
I
should
receive
the
half
-
yearly
dividend
,
unless
I
be
here
in
person
,
or
have
some
friend
I
could
trust
with
have
the
stock
in
his
name
to
do
it
for
me
,
and
that
would
have
the
same
difficulty
in
it
as
before
;
and
with
that
he
look
hard
at
me
and
smile
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
say
he
,
"
why
do
you
not
get
a
head
steward
,
madam
,
that
may
take
you
and
your
money
together
into
keeping
,
and
then
you
would
have
the
trouble
take
off
your
hand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
sir
,
and
the
money
too
,
it
may
be
,
"
say
I
;
"
for
truly
I
find
the
hazard
that
way
be
as
much
as
'
tis
t'other
way
"
;
but
I
remember
I
say
secretly
to
myself
,
"
I
wish
you
would
ask
me
the
question
fairly
,
I
would
consider
very
seriously
on
it
before
I
say
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
on
a
good
way
with
me
,
and
I
think
once
or
twice
he
be
in
earnest
,
but
to
my
real
affliction
,
I
find
at
last
he
have
a
wife
;
but
when
he
own
he
have
a
wife
he
shake
his
head
,
and
say
with
some
concern
,
that
indeed
he
have
a
wife
,
and
no
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
he
have
be
in
the
condition
of
my
late
lover
,
and
that
his
wife
have
be
distemper
or
lunatic
,
or
some
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
we
have
not
much
more
discourse
at
that
time
,
but
he
tell
me
he
be
in
too
much
hurry
of
business
then
,
but
that
if
I
would
come
home
to
his
house
after
their
business
be
over
,
he
would
by
that
time
consider
what
may
be
do
for
me
,
to
put
my
affair
in
a
posture
of
security
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
come
,
and
desire
to
know
where
he
live
.
<EOS>
He
give
me
a
direction
in
writing
,
and
when
he
give
it
me
he
read
it
to
me
,
and
say
,
"
there
'
tis
,
madam
,
if
you
dare
trust
yourself
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
believe
I
may
venture
to
trust
you
with
myself
,
for
you
have
a
wife
,
you
say
,
and
I
do
not
want
a
husband
;
besides
,
I
dare
trust
you
with
my
money
,
which
be
all
I
have
in
the
world
,
and
if
that
be
go
,
I
may
trust
myself
anywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
some
thing
in
jest
that
be
very
handsome
and
mannerly
,
and
would
have
please
me
very
well
if
they
have
be
in
earnest
;
but
that
pass
over
,
I
take
the
direction
,
and
appoint
to
attend
him
at
his
house
at
seven
o'clock
the
same
evening
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
he
make
several
proposal
for
my
place
my
money
in
the
bank
,
in
order
to
my
have
interest
for
it
;
but
still
some
difficulty
or
other
come
in
the
way
,
which
he
object
as
not
safe
;
and
<EOS>
I
find
such
a
sincere
disintereste
honesty
in
him
,
that
I
begin
to
muse
with
myself
,
that
I
have
certainly
find
the
honest
man
I
want
,
and
that
I
could
never
put
myself
into
well
hand
;
so
I
tell
him
with
a
great
deal
of
frankness
that
I
have
never
meet
with
a
man
or
woman
yet
that
I
could
trust
,
or
in
whom
I
could
think
myself
safe
,
but
that
I
see
he
be
so
disinterestedly
concerned
for
my
safety
,
that
I
say
I
would
freely
trust
him
with
the
management
of
that
little
I
have
,
if
he
would
accept
to
be
steward
for
a
poor
widow
that
could
give
him
no
salary
.
  
<EOS>
He
smile
and
,
stand
up
,
with
great
respect
salute
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
could
not
but
take
it
very
kindly
that
I
have
so
good
an
opinion
of
him
;
that
he
would
not
deceive
me
,
that
he
would
do
anything
in
his
power
to
serve
me
,
and
expect
no
salary
;
but
that
he
could
not
by
any
mean
accept
of
a
trust
,
that
it
may
bring
him
to
be
suspect
of
self
-
interest
,
and
that
if
I
should
die
he
may
have
dispute
with
my
executor
,
which
he
should
be
very
loth
to
encumber
himself
with
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
if
those
be
all
his
objection
I
would
soon
remove
them
,
and
convince
him
that
there
be
not
the
least
room
for
any
difficulty
;
for
that
,
first
,
as
for
suspect
him
,
if
ever
I
should
do
it
,
now
be
the
time
to
suspect
him
,
and
not
put
the
trust
into
his
hand
,
and
whenever
I
do
suspect
him
,
he
could
but
throw
it
up
then
and
refuse
to
go
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
to
executor
,
I
assure
him
<EOS>
I
have
no
heir
,
nor
any
relation
in
England
,
and
I
should
alter
my
condition
before
I
die
,
and
then
his
trust
and
trouble
should
cease
together
,
which
,
however
,
I
have
no
prospect
of
yet
;
but
I
tell
him
if
I
die
as
I
be
,
it
should
be
all
his
own
,
and
he
would
deserve
it
by
be
so
faithful
to
me
as
I
be
satisfied
he
would
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
change
his
countenance
at
this
discourse
,
and
ask
me
how
I
come
to
have
so
much
good
-
will
for
him
;
and
,
look
very
much
pleased
,
say
he
may
very
lawfully
wish
he
be
a
single
man
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
smile
,
and
tell
him
as
he
be
not
,
my
offer
could
have
no
design
upon
him
in
it
,
and
to
wish
,
as
he
do
,
be
not
to
be
allow
,
'
twas
criminal
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
madam
,
as
I
say
before
,
I
have
a
wife
and
no
wife
,
and
 
'
twould
be
no
sin
to
me
to
wish
her
hang
,
if
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
your
circumstance
that
way
,
sir
,
"
say
I
;
"
but
it
can
not
be
innocent
to
wish
your
wife
dead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
say
he
again
,
<EOS>
"
she
be
a
wife
and
no
wife
;
you
do
not
know
what
I
be
,
or
what
she
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
say
I
;
"
sir
,
I
do
not
know
what
you
be
,
but
I
believe
you
to
be
an
honest
man
,
and
that
be
the
cause
of
all
my
confidence
in
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
so
I
be
,
I
hope
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
something
else
too
,
madam
;
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
be
plain
with
you
,
I
be
a
cuckold
,
and
she
be
a
whore
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
speak
it
in
a
kind
of
jest
,
but
it
be
with
such
an
awkward
smile
,
that
I
perceive
it
be
what
strike
very
close
to
him
,
and
he
look
dismally
when
he
say
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
alter
the
case
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
as
to
that
part
you
be
speak
of
;
but
a
cuckold
,
you
know
,
may
be
an
honest
man
;
it
do
not
alter
that
case
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
think
,
"
say
I
,
"
since
your
wife
be
so
dishonest
to
you
,
you
be
too
honest
to
her
to
own
her
for
your
wife
;
but
that
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
what
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
think
to
clear
my
hand
of
her
;
for
,
to
be
plain
with
you
,
madam
,
"
add
he
,
"
I
be
no
contend
cuckold
neither
:
 
on
the
other
hand
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
it
provoke
me
the
high
degree
,
but
I
can
not
help
myself
;
she
that
will
be
a
whore
,
will
be
a
whore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
waive
the
discourse
and
begin
to
talk
of
my
business
;
but
I
find
he
could
not
have
do
with
it
,
so
I
let
him
alone
,
and
he
go
on
to
tell
me
all
the
circumstance
of
his
case
,
too
long
to
relate
here
;
particularly
,
that
have
be
out
of
England
some
time
before
he
come
to
the
post
he
be
in
,
she
have
have
two
child
in
the
meantime
by
an
officer
of
the
army
;
and
that
when
he
come
to
England
and
,
upon
her
submission
,
take
her
again
,
and
maintain
her
very
well
,
yet
she
run
away
from
him
with
a
linen
-
draper
's
apprentice
,
rob
him
of
what
she
could
come
at
,
and
continue
to
live
from
him
still
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
that
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
"
she
be
a
whore
not
by
necessity
,
which
be
the
common
bait
of
your
sex
,
but
by
inclination
,
and
for
the
sake
of
the
vice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
pity
him
,
and
wish
him
well
rid
of
her
,
and
still
would
have
talk
of
my
business
,
but
it
would
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
look
steadily
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
you
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
come
to
ask
advice
of
me
,
and
I
will
serve
you
as
faithfully
as
if
you
be
my
own
sister
;
but
I
must
turn
the
table
,
since
you
oblige
me
to
do
it
,
and
be
so
friendly
to
me
,
and
I
think
I
must
ask
advice
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
,
what
must
a
poor
abuse
fellow
do
with
a
whore
?
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
to
do
myself
justice
upon
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
'
tis
a
case
too
nice
for
me
to
advise
in
,
but
it
seem
she
have
run
away
from
you
,
so
you
be
rid
of
her
fairly
;
what
can
you
desire
more
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
she
be
go
indeed
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
I
be
not
clear
of
her
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
say
I
;
"
she
may
indeed
run
you
into
debt
,
but
the
law
have
furnish
you
with
method
to
prevent
that
also
;
you
may
cry
her
down
,
as
they
call
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
be
not
the
case
neither
;
I
have
take
care
of
all
that
;
'
tis
not
that
part
that
I
speak
of
,
but
I
would
be
rid
of
her
so
that
I
may
marry
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
then
you
must
divorce
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
can
prove
what
you
say
,
you
may
certainly
get
that
do
,
and
then
,
I
suppose
,
you
be
free

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
tedious
and
expensive

he
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
you
can
get
any
woman
you
like
to
take
your

ay
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
 
'
twould
be
hard
to
bring
an
honest
woman
to
do
that
;
and
for
the
other
sort
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
have
enough
of
her
to
meddle
with
any
more
whore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
occur
to
me
presently
,
"
I
would
have
take
your
word
with
all
my
heart
,
if
you
have
but
ask
me
the
question
"
;
but
that
be
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
to
him
I
reply
,
"
why
,
you
shut
the
door
against
any
honest
woman
accept
you
,
for
you
condemn
all
that
should
venture
upon
you
at
once
,
and
conclude
,
that
really
a
woman
that
take
you
now
can
not
be
honest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
wish
you
would
satisfy
me
that
an
honest
woman
would
take
me
;
I
would
venture
it
"
;
and
then
turn
short
upon
me
,
"
Will
you
take
me
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
a
fair
question
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
after
what
you
have
say
;
however
,
lest
you
should
think
I
wait
only
for
a
recantation
of
it
,
I
shall
answer
you
plainly
,
no
,
not
I
;
my
business
be
of
another
kind
with
you
,
and
I
do
not
expect
you
would
have
turn
my
serious
application
to
you
,
in
my
own
distracted
case
,
into
a
comedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
my
case
be
as
distract
as
yours
can
be
,
and
I
stand
in
as
much
need
of
advice
as
you
do
,
for
I
think
if
I
have
not
relief
somewhere
,
I
shall
be
make
myself
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
course
to
take
,
I
protest
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
'
tis
easy
to
give
advice
in
your
case
,
much
easy
than
it
be
in
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
speak
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
beg
of
you
,
for
now
you
encourage
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
your
case
be
so
plain
as
you
say
it
be
,
you
may
be
legally
divorce
,
and
then
you
may
find
honest
woman
enough
to
ask
the
question
of
fairly
;
the
sex
be
not
so
scarce
that
you
can
want
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
in
earnest
;
I
will
take
your
advice
;
but
shall
I
ask
you
one
question
seriously
beforehand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
any
question
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
that
you
do
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
that
answer
will
not
do
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
for
,
in
short
,
that
be
the
question
I
shall
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
ask
what
question
you
please
,
but
you
have
my
answer
to
that
already
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
besides
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
can
you
think
so
ill
of
me
as
that
I
would
give
any
answer
to
such
a
question
beforehand
?
 
<EOS>
Can
any
woman
alive
believe
you
in
earnest
,
or
think
you
design
anything
but
to
banter
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
banter
you
,
I
be
in
earnest
;
consider
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
a
little
gravely
,
"
I
come
to
you
about
my
own
business
;
I
beg
of
you
to
let
me
know
,
what
you
will
advise
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
prepare
,
"
say
he
,
"
against
you
come
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
have
forbid
my
come
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
and
look
a
little
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
can
not
expect
I
should
visit
you
on
the
account
you
talk
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
shall
promise
me
to
come
again
,
however
,
and
I
will
not
say
any
more
of
it
till
I
have
get
the
divorce
,
but
<EOS>
I
desire
you
will
prepare
to
be
better
condition
when
that
be
do
,
for
you
shall
be
the
woman
,
or
I
will
not
be
divorce
at
all
;
why
,
I
owe
it
to
your
unlooked
-
for
kindness
,
if
it
be
to
nothing
else
,
but
I
have
other
reason
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
say
anything
in
the
world
that
please
me
better
;
however
,
I
know
that
the
way
to
secure
him
be
to
stand
off
while
the
thing
be
so
remote
,
as
it
appear
to
be
,
and
that
it
be
time
enough
to
accept
of
it
when
he
be
able
to
perform
it
;
so
I
say
very
respectfully
to
him
,
it
be
time
enough
to
consider
of
these
thing
when
he
be
in
a
condition
to
talk
of
them
;
in
the
meantime
,
I
tell
him
,
I
be
go
a
great
way
from
him
,
and
he
would
find
object
enough
to
please
him
better
.
 
<EOS>
We
break
off
here
for
the
present
,
and
he
make
me
promise
him
to
come
again
the
next
day
,
for
his
resolution
upon
my
own
business
,
which
after
some
pressing
I
do
;
though
have
he
see
farther
into
me
,
I
want
no
press
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
the
next
evening
,
accordingly
,
and
bring
my
maid
with
me
,
to
let
him
see
that
I
keep
a
maid
,
but
I
send
her
away
as
soon
as
I
be
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
have
me
let
the
maid
have
stay
,
but
I
would
not
,
but
order
her
aloud
to
come
for
me
again
about
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
forbid
that
,
and
tell
me
he
would
see
me
safe
home
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
be
not
very
well
please
with
,
suppose
he
may
do
that
to
know
where
I
live
and
inquire
into
my
character
and
circumstance
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
venture
that
,
for
all
that
the
people
there
or
thereabout
know
of
me
,
be
to
my
advantage
;
and
all
the
character
he
have
of
me
,
after
he
have
inquire
,
be
that
I
be
a
woman
of
fortune
,
and
that
I
be
a
very
modest
,
sober
body
;
which
,
whether
true
or
not
in
the
main
,
yet
you
may
see
how
necessary
it
be
for
all
woman
who
expect
anything
in
the
world
,
to
preserve
the
character
of
their
virtue
,
even
when
perhaps
they
may
have
sacrifice
the
thing
itself
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
,
and
be
not
a
little
please
with
it
,
that
he
have
provide
a
supper
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
also
he
live
very
handsomely
,
and
have
a
house
very
handsomely
furnished
;
all
of
which
I
be
rejoice
at
indeed
,
for
I
look
upon
it
as
all
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
now
a
second
conference
upon
the
subject
-
matter
of
the
last
conference
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
his
business
very
home
indeed
;
he
protest
his
affection
to
me
,
and
indeed
I
have
no
room
to
doubt
it
;
he
declare
that
it
begin
from
the
first
moment
I
talk
with
him
,
and
long
before
I
have
mention
leave
my
effect
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
no
matter
when
it
begin
,
"
think
I
;
"
if
it
will
but
hold
,
'
twill
be
well
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
tell
me
how
much
the
offer
I
have
make
of
trust
him
with
my
effect
,
and
leave
them
to
him
,
have
engage
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
I
intend
it
should
,
"
think
I
,
"
<EOS>
but
then
I
think
you
have
be
a
single
man
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
after
we
have
sup
,
I
observe
he
press
me
very
hard
to
drink
two
or
three
glass
of
wine
,
which
,
however
,
I
decline
,
but
drank
one
glass
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
tell
me
he
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
me
,
which
I
should
promise
him
I
would
not
take
ill
if
I
should
not
grant
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
hope
he
would
make
no
dishonourable
proposal
to
me
,
especially
in
his
own
house
,
and
that
if
it
be
such
,
I
desire
he
would
not
propose
it
,
that
I
may
not
be
oblige
to
offer
any
resentment
to
him
that
do
not
become
the
respect
I
profess
for
him
,
and
the
trust
I
have
place
in
him
in
come
to
his
house
;
and
beg
of
him
he
would
give
me
leave
to
go
away
,
and
accordingly
begin
to
put
on
my
glove
and
prepare
to
be
go
,
though
at
the
same
time
I
no
more
intend
it
than
he
intend
to
let
me
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
he
importune
me
not
to
talk
of
go
;
he
assure
me
he
have
no
dishonourable
thing
in
his
thought
about
me
,
and
be
very
far
from
offer
anything
to
me
that
be
dishonourable
,
and
if
I
think
so
,
he
would
choose
to
say
no
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
that
part
I
do
not
relish
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
ready
to
hear
anything
that
he
have
to
say
,
depend
that
he
would
say
nothing
unworthy
of
himself
,
or
unfit
for
me
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
he
tell
me
his
proposal
be
this
:
 
that
I
would
marry
him
,
though
he
have
not
yet
obtain
the
divorce
from
the
whore
his
wife
;
and
to
satisfy
me
that
he
mean
honourably
,
he
would
promise
not
to
desire
me
to
live
with
him
,
or
go
to
bed
with
him
till
the
divorce
be
obtain
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
say
yes
to
this
offer
at
first
word
,
but
it
be
necessary
to
play
the
hypocrite
a
little
more
with
him
;
so
I
seem
to
decline
the
motion
with
some
warmth
,
and
besides
a
little
condemn
the
thing
as
unfair
,
tell
him
that
such
a
proposal
could
be
of
no
signification
,
but
to
entangle
us
both
in
great
difficulty
;
for
if
he
should
not
at
last
obtain
the
divorce
,
yet
we
could
not
dissolve
the
marriage
,
neither
could
we
proceed
in
it
;
so
that
if
he
be
disappoint
in
the
divorce
,
I
leave
him
to
consider
what
a
condition
we
should
both
be
in
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
carry
on
the
argument
against
this
so
far
,
that
I
convince
him
it
be
not
a
proposal
that
have
any
sense
in
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
then
he
go
from
it
to
another
,
and
that
be
,
that
I
would
sign
and
seal
a
contract
with
him
,
condition
to
marry
him
as
soon
as
the
divorce
be
obtain
,
and
to
be
void
if
he
could
not
obtain
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
such
a
thing
be
more
rational
than
the
other
;
but
as
this
be
the
first
time
that
ever
I
could
imagine
him
weak
enough
to
be
in
earnest
in
this
affair
,
I
do
not
use
to
say
yes
at
first
asking
;
I
would
consider
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
play
with
this
lover
as
an
angler
do
with
a
trout
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
have
him
fast
on
the
hook
,
so
I
jest
with
his
new
proposal
,
and
put
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
know
little
of
me
,
and
bade
him
inquire
about
me
<EOS>
;
I
let
him
also
go
home
with
me
to
my
lodging
,
though
I
would
not
ask
him
to
go
in
,
for
I
tell
him
it
be
not
decent
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
venture
to
avoid
sign
a
contract
of
marriage
,
and
the
reason
why
I
do
it
be
because
the
lady
that
have
invite
me
so
earnestly
to
go
with
her
into
Lancashire
insist
so
positively
upon
it
,
and
promise
me
such
great
fortune
,
and
such
fine
thing
there
,
that
I
be
tempt
to
go
and
try
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
may
mend
myself
very
much
"
;
and
then
I
make
no
scruple
in
my
thought
of
quit
my
honest
citizen
,
whom
I
be
not
so
much
in
love
with
as
not
to
leave
him
for
a
rich
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
avoid
a
contract
;
but
tell
him
I
would
go
into
the
north
,
that
he
should
know
where
to
write
to
me
by
the
consequence
of
the
business
I
have
entrust
with
him
;
that
I
would
give
him
a
sufficient
pledge
of
my
respect
for
him
,
for
I
would
leave
almost
all
I
have
in
the
world
in
his
hand
;
and
I
would
thus
far
give
him
my
word
,
that
as
soon
as
he
have
sue
out
a
divorce
from
his
first
wife
,
he
would
send
me
an
account
of
it
,
I
would
come
up
to
London
,
and
that
then
we
would
talk
seriously
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
base
design
I
go
with
,
that
I
must
confess
,
though
I
be
invite
thither
with
a
design
much
bad
than
mine
be
,
as
the
sequel
will
discover
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
go
with
my
friend
,
as
I
call
her
,
into
Lancashire
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
way
we
go
she
caress
me
with
the
utmost
appearance
of
a
sincere
,
undissembled
affection
;
treat
me
,
except
my
coach
-
hire
,
all
the
way
;
and
her
brother
bring
a
gentleman
's
coach
to
Warrington
to
receive
us
,
and
we
be
carry
from
thence
to
Liverpool
with
as
much
ceremony
as
I
could
desire
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
also
entertain
at
a
merchant
's
house
in
Liverpool
three
or
four
day
very
handsomely
;
I
forbear
to
tell
his
name
,
because
of
what
follow
.
<EOS>
then
she
tell
me
she
would
carry
me
to
an
uncle
's
house
of
hers
,
where
we
should
be
nobly
entertain
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
so
;
her
uncle
,
as
she
call
him
,
send
a
coach
and
four
horse
for
us
,
and
we
be
carry
near
forty
mile
I
know
not
whither
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
,
however
,
to
a
gentleman
's
seat
,
where
be
a
numerous
family
,
a
large
park
,
extraordinary
company
indeed
,
and
where
she
be
call
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
if
she
have
resolve
to
bring
me
into
such
company
as
this
,
she
should
have
let
me
have
prepare
myself
,
and
have
furnish
myself
with
well
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
take
notice
of
that
,
and
tell
me
very
genteelly
they
do
not
value
people
in
their
country
so
much
by
their
clothe
as
they
do
in
London
;
that
their
cousin
have
fully
inform
them
of
my
quality
,
and
that
I
do
not
want
clothe
to
set
me
off
;
in
short
,
they
entertain
me
,
not
like
what
I
be
,
but
like
what
they
think
I
have
be
,
namely
,
a
widow
lady
of
a
great
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
discovery
I
make
here
be
,
that
the
family
be
all
Roman
Catholics
,
and
the
cousin
too
,
whom
I
call
my
friend
;
however
,
I
must
say
that
nobody
in
the
world
could
behave
better
to
me
,
and
I
have
all
the
civility
show
me
that
I
could
have
have
if
I
have
be
of
their
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
have
not
so
much
principle
of
any
kind
as
to
be
nice
in
point
of
religion
,
and
I
presently
learn
to
speak
favourably
of
the
Romish
Church
;
particularly
,
I
tell
them
I
see
little
<EOS>
but
the
prejudice
of
education
in
all
the
difference
that
be
among
Christians
about
religion
,
<EOS>
and
if
it
have
so
happen
that
my
father
have
be
a
Roman
Catholic
,
I
doubt
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
be
as
well
pleased
with
their
religion
as
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
this
oblige
them
in
the
high
degree
,
and
as
I
be
besiege
day
and
night
with
good
company
and
pleasant
discourse
,
so
I
have
two
or
three
old
lady
that
lie
at
me
upon
the
subject
of
religion
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
complaisant
,
that
though
I
would
not
completely
engage
,
yet
I
make
no
scruple
to
be
present
at
their
mass
,
and
to
conform
to
all
their
gesture
as
they
show
me
the
pattern
,
but
I
would
not
come
too
cheap
;
so
that
I
only
in
the
main
encourage
them
to
expect
that
I
would
turn
Roman
Catholic
,
if
I
be
instruct
in
the
catholic
doctrine
as
they
call
it
,
and
so
the
matter
rest
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay
here
about
six
week
;
and
then
my
conductor
lead
me
back
to
a
country
village
,
about
six
mile
from
Liverpool
,
where
her
brother
(
as
she
call
him
)
come
to
visit
me
in
his
own
chariot
,
and
in
a
very
good
figure
,
with
two
footman
in
a
good
livery
;
and
the
next
thing
be
to
make
love
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
have
happen
to
me
,
one
would
think
I
could
not
have
be
cheat
,
and
indeed
I
think
so
myself
,
have
a
safe
card
at
home
,
which
I
resolve
not
to
quit
unless
I
could
mend
myself
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
in
all
appearance
this
brother
be
a
match
worth
my
listening
to
,
and
the
least
his
estate
be
value
at
be
#
#
#
#
1000
a
year
,
but
the
sister
say
it
be
worth
#
#
#
#
1500
a
year
,
and
 
lie
most
of
it
in
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
that
be
a
great
fortune
,
and
pass
for
such
,
be
above
be
ask
how
much
my
estate
be
;
and
my
false
friend
take
it
upon
a
foolish
hearsay
,
have
raise
it
from
#
#
#
#
500
to
#
#
#
#
5000
,
and
by
the
time
she
come
into
the
country
she
call
it
 
#
#
#
#
15,000
.
 
<EOS>
the
Irishman
,
for
such
I
understand
him
to
be
,
be
stark
mad
at
this
bait
;
in
short
,
he
court
me
,
make
me
present
,
and
run
in
debt
like
a
madman
for
the
expense
of
his
equipage
and
of
 
his
courtship
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
the
appearance
of
an
extraordinary
fine
gentleman
;
he
be
tall
,
well
-
shape
,
and
have
an
extraordinary
address
;
talk
as
naturally
of
his
park
and
his
stable
,
of
his
horse
,
his
gamekeeper
,
his
wood
,
his
tenant
,
and
his
servant
,
as
if
we
have
be
in
the
mansion
-
house
,
and
I
have
see
them
all
about
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
never
so
much
as
ask
me
about
my
fortune
or
estate
,
but
assure
me
that
when
we
come
to
Dublin
he
would
jointure
me
in
#
#
#
#
600
a
year
good
land
;
and
that
we
could
enter
into
a
deed
of
settlement
or
contract
here
for
the
performance
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
such
language
indeed
as
I
have
not
be
use
to
,
and
I
be
here
beat
out
of
all
my
measure
;
I
have
a
she
-
devil
in
my
bosom
,
every
hour
tell
me
how
great
her
brother
live
.
<EOS>
one
time
she
would
come
for
my
order
,
how
I
would
have
my
coach
paint
,
and
how
line
;
and
another
time
what
clothe
my
page
should
wear
;
in
short
,
my
eye
be
dazzle
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
lose
my
power
of
say
no
,
and
,
to
cut
the
story
short
,
I
consent
to
be
marry
;
but
to
be
the
more
private
,
we
be
carry
farther
into
the
country
,
and
marry
by
a
Romish
clergyman
,
who
I
be
assure
would
marry
us
as
effectually
as
a
Church
of
England
parson
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
<EOS>
but
I
have
some
reflection
in
this
affair
upon
the
dishonourable
forsake
my
faithful
citizen
,
who
love
me
sincerely
,
and
who
be
endeavour
to
quit
himself
of
a
scandalous
whore
by
whom
he
have
be
indeed
barbarously
use
,
and
promise
himself
infinite
happiness
in
his
new
choice
;
which
choice
be
now
give
up
herself
to
another
in
a
manner
almost
as
scandalous
as
her
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
glitter
shoe
of
a
great
estate
,
and
of
fine
thing
,
which
the
deceive
creature
that
be
now
my
deceiver
represent
every
hour
to
my
imagination
,
hurry
me
away
,
and
give
me
no
time
to
think
of
London
,
or
of
anything
there
,
much
less
of
the
obligation
I
have
to
a
person
of
infinitely
more
real
merit
than
what
be
now
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
thing
be
do
;
I
be
now
in
the
arm
of
my
new
spouse
,
who
appear
still
the
same
as
before
;
great
even
to
magnificence
,
and
nothing
less
than
#
#
#
#
1000
a
year
could
support
the
ordinary
equipage
he
appear
in
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
be
marry
about
a
month
,
he
begin
to
talk
of
my
go
to
West
Chester
in
order
to
embark
for
Ireland
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
do
not
hurry
me
,
for
we
stay
near
three
week
longer
,
and
then
he
send
to
Chester
for
a
coach
to
meet
us
at
the
Black
Rock
,
as
they
call
it
,
over
against
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
we
go
in
a
fine
boat
they
call
a
pinnace
,
with
six
oar
;
his
servant
,
and
horse
,
and
baggage
go
in
the
ferry
-
boat
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
excuse
to
me
that
he
have
no
acquaintance
in
Chester
,
but
he
would
go
before
and
get
some
handsome
apartment
for
me
at
a
private
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
how
long
we
should
stay
at
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
not
at
all
,
any
long
than
one
night
or
two
,
but
he
would
immediately
hire
a
coach
to
go
to
Holyhead
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
tell
him
he
should
by
no
mean
give
 
himself
the
trouble
to
get
private
lodging
for
one
night
or
two
,
for
that
Chester
be
a
great
place
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
there
would
be
very
good
inn
and
accommodation
enough
;
so
we
lodge
at
an
inn
in
the
West
Street
,
not
far
from
the
Cathedral
;
I
forget
what
sign
it
be
at
.
  
<EOS>
here
my
spouse
,
talk
of
my
go
to
Ireland
,
ask
me
if
I
have
no
affair
to
settle
at
London
before
we
go
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
no
,
not
of
any
great
consequence
,
but
what
may
be
do
as
well
by
letter
from
Dublin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
he
,
very
respectfully
,
"
I
suppose
the
great
part
of
your
estate
,
which
my
sister
tell
me
be
most
of
it
in
money
in
the
Bank
of
England
,
lie
secure
enough
,
but
in
case
it
require
transfer
,
or
any
way
alter
its
property
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
go
up
to
London
and
settle
those
thing
before
we
go
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
seem
to
look
strange
at
it
,
and
tell
him
I
know
not
what
he
mean
;
that
I
have
no
effect
in
the
Bank
of
England
that
I
know
of
;
and
I
hope
he
could
not
say
that
I
have
ever
tell
him
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
say
,
I
have
not
tell
him
so
,
but
his
sister
have
say
the
great
part
of
my
estate
lie
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
only
mention
it
,
me
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
if
there
be
any
occasion
to
settle
it
,
or
order
anything
about
it
,
we
may
not
be
oblige
to
the
hazard
and
trouble
of
another
voyage
back
again
"
;
for
he
add
,
that
he
do
not
care
to
venture
me
too
much
upon
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
at
this
talk
,
and
begin
to
consider
very
seriously
what
the
meaning
of
it
must
be
;
and
it
presently
occur
to
me
that
my
friend
,
who
call
him
brother
,
have
represent
me
in
colour
which
be
not
my
due
;
and
I
think
,
since
it
be
come
to
that
pitch
,
that
I
would
know
the
bottom
of
it
before
I
go
out
of
England
,
and
before
I
should
put
myself
into
I
<EOS>
know
not
whose
hand
in
a
strange
country
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
I
call
his
sister
into
my
chamber
the
next
morning
,
and
let
her
know
the
discourse
her
brother
<EOS>
and
I
have
be
upon
the
evening
before
<EOS>
,
I
conjure
her
to
tell
me
what
she
have
say
to
him
,
and
upon
what
foot
it
be
that
she
have
make
this
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
She
own
that
she
have
tell
him
that
I
be
a
great
fortune
,
and
say
that
she
be
tell
so
at
London
.
<EOS>
"
tell
so
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
warmly
;
"
do
I
ever
tell
you
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
no
,
she
say
,
it
be
true
<EOS>
I
do
not
tell
her
so
,
but
<EOS>
I
have
say
several
time
that
what
I
have
be
in
my
own
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
,
"
return
I
very
quickly
and
hastily
,
"
but
I
never
tell
you
I
have
anything
call
a
fortune
;
no
,
not
that
I
have
#
#
#
#
100
,
or
the
value
of
#
#
#
#
100
,
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
any
how
do
it
consist
with
my
be
a
fortune
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
I
should
come
here
into
the
north
of
England
with
you
,
only
upon
the
account
of
live
cheap
?
<EOS>
"
at
these
word
,
which
I
speak
warm
and
high
,
my
husband
,
her
brother
(
as
she
call
him
)
,
come
into
the
room
,
and
I
desire
him
to
come
and
sit
down
,
for
I
have
something
of
moment
to
say
before
them
both
,
which
it
be
absolutely
necessary
he
should
hear
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
a
little
disturb
at
the
assurance
with
which
I
seem
to
speak
it
,
and
come
and
sit
down
by
me
,
have
first
shut
the
door
;
upon
which
I
begin
,
for
I
be
very
much
provoke
,
and
turn
myself
to
him
,
"
I
be
afraid
,
"
say
I
,
"
my
dear
"
(
for
I
speak
with
kindness
on
his
side
)
,
"
that
you
have
a
very
great
abuse
put
upon
you
,
and
an
injury
do
you
never
to
be
repair
in
your
marry
me
,
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
as
I
have
have
no
hand
in
it
,
I
desire
I
may
be
fairly
acquit
of
it
,
and
that
the
blame
may
lie
where
it
ought
to
lie
,
and
nowhere
else
,
for
I
wash
my
hand
of
every
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
injury
can
be
do
me
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
in
marry
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
to
my
honour
and
advantage
every
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
soon
explain
it
to
you
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
fear
you
will
have
no
reason
to
think
yourself
well
used
;
but
I
will
convince
you
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
again
,
"
that
I
have
have
no
hand
in
it
"
;
and
there
I
stop
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
now
scared
and
wild
,
and
begin
,
I
believe
,
to
suspect
what
follow
;
however
,
look
towards
me
,
and
say
only
,
"
go
on
,
"
he
sit
silent
,
as
if
to
hear
what
I
have
more
to
say
;
so
I
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
last
night
,
"
say
I
,
speak
to
him
,
"
if
ever
I

any
boast

you
any
reason
from
me

so

any
discourse
about
it

;
and
he
own
again
I
have
not
,
but
say
I
have
appear
always
as
a
woman
of
fortune
,
and
he
depend
on
it
that
I
be
so

and
hope
he
be
not
deceive

<EOS>
"
I
be
not
inquire
yet
whether
you
have

deceive

not

"
say
I
;
"
I
fear
you

I
too

I
be
clear
myself
from
the
unjust
charge

concern
in
deceive
you

<EOS>
"
I
have
be
now

your

any
pray

say
I
,
turn
myself
to
her

be
so
just
to
me

before
your

to

me

pretend
to
you
that
I
have
an
estate
;
and
why
,
if
I
have
,
should
I
come
down
into
this
country
with
you
on
purpose
to
spare
that
little
I
have
,
and
live
cheap
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
deny
one
word
,
but
say
she
have
be
tell
in
London
that
I
have
a
very
great
fortune
,
and
that
it
lie
in
the
Bank
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
dear
sir
,
"
say
I
,
turn
myself
to
my
new
spouse
again
,
"
be
so
just
to
me
as
to
tell
me
who
have
abuse
both
you
and
me
so
much
as
to
make
you
believe
I
be
a
fortune
,
and
prompt
you
to
court
me
to
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
speak
a
word
,
but
point
to
her
;
and
,
after
some
more
pause
,
fly
out
in
the
most
furious
passion
that
ever
I
see
a
man
in
my
life
,
curse
her
,
and
call
her
all
the
whore
and
hard
name
he
could
think
of
;
and
that
she
have
ruin
him
,
declare
that
she
have
tell
him
I
have
#
#
#
#
15,000
,
and
that
she
be
to
have
#
#
#
#
500
of
him
for
procure
this
match
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
add
,
direct
his
speech
to
me
,
that
she
be
none
of
his
sister
,
but
have
be
his
whore
for
two
year
before
,
that
she
have
have
#
#
#
#
100
of
him
in
part
of
this
bargain
,
and
that
he
be
utterly
undone
if
thing
be
as
I
say
;
and
in
his
raving
he
swear
he
would
let
her
heart
's
blood
out
immediately
,
which
frighten
her
and
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
cry
,
say
she
have
be
tell
so
in
the
house
where
I
lodge
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
aggravate
him
more
than
before
,
that
she
should
put
so
far
upon
him
,
and
run
thing
such
a
length
upon
no
other
authority
than
a
hearsay
;
and
then
<EOS>
,
turn
to
me
again
,
say
very
honestly
,
he
be
afraid
we
be
both
undone
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
,
to
be
plain
,
my
dear
,
I
have
no
estate
,
"
say
he
;
"
what
little
I
have
,
this
devil
have
make
me
run
out
in
wait
on
you
and
put
me
into
this
equipage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
take
the
opportunity
of
his
be
earnest
in
talk
with
me
,
and
get
out
of
the
room
,
and
I
never
see
her
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
confound
now
as
much
as
he
,
 
and
know
not
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
many
way
that
I
have
the
bad
of
it
,
but
his
saying
he
be
undone
,
and
that
he
have
no
estate
neither
,
put
me
into
a
mere
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
this
have
be
a
hellish
juggle
,
for
we
be
marry
here
upon
the
foot
of
a
double
fraud
;
you
be
undo
by
the
disappointment
,
it
seem
;
and
if
I
have
have
a
fortune
I
have
be
cheat
too
,
for
you
say
you
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
indeed
have
be
cheat
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
you
would
not
have
be
undo
,
for
#
#
#
#
15,000
would
have
maintain
us
both
very
handsomely
in
this
country
;
and
I
assure
you
,
"
add
he
,
"
I
have
resolve
to
have
dedicate
every
groat
of
it
to
you
;
I
would
not
have
wrong
you
of
a
shilling
,
and
the
rest
I
would
have
make
up
in
my
affection
to
you
,
and
tenderness
of
you
,
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
honest
indeed
,
and
I
really
believe
he
speak
as
he
intend
,
and
that
he
be
a
man
that
be
as
well
qualified
to
make
me
happy
,
as
to
his
temper
and
behaviour
,
as
any
man
ever
be
;
but
his
have
no
estate
,
and
be
run
into
debt
on
this
ridiculous
account
in
the
country
,
make
all
the
prospect
dismal
and
dreadful
,
and
I
know
not
what
to
say
,
or
what
to
think
of
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
it
be
very
unhappy
that
so
much
love
,
and
so
much
good
nature
as
I
discover
in
him
,
should
be
thus
precipitate
into
misery
;
that
I
see
nothing
before
us
but
ruin
;
for
as
to
me
,
it
be
my
unhappiness
that
what
little
I
have
be
not
able
to
relieve
us
week
,
and
with
that
I
pull
out
a
bank
bill
of
#
#
#
#
20
and
eleven
guinea
,
which
I
tell
him
I
have
save
out
of
 
my
little
income
,
and
that
by
the
account
that
creature
have
give
me
of
the
way
of
live
in
that
country
,
I
expect
it
would
maintain
me
three
or
four
year
;
that
if
it
be
take
from
me
,
I
be
leave
destitute
,
and
he
know
what
the
condition
of
a
woman
among
stranger
must
be
,
if
she
have
no
money
in
her
pocket
;
however
,
I
tell
him
,
if
he
would
take
it
,
there
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
with
a
great
concern
,
and
I
think
I
see
tear
stand
in
his
eye
,
that
he
would
not
touch
it
;
that
he
abhor
the
thought
of
strip
me
and
make
me
miserable
;
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
have
fifty
guinea
leave
,
which
be
all
he
have
in
the
world
,
and
he
pull
it
out
and
throw
it
down
on
the
table
,
bid
me
take
it
,
though
he
be
to
starve
for
want
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
,
with
the
same
concern
for
him
,
that
I
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
talk
so
;
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
if
he
could
propose
any
probable
method
of
living
,
I
would
do
anything
that
become
me
on
my
part
,
and
that
I
would
live
as
close
and
as
narrow
as
he
could
desire
.
  
<EOS>
He
beg
of
me
to
talk
no
more
at
that
rate
,
for
it
would
make
him
distract
;
he
say
he
be
breed
a
gentleman
,
though
he
be
reduce
to
a
low
fortune
,
and
that
there
be
but
<EOS>
one
way
leave
which
he
could
think
of
,
and
that
would
not
do
,
unless
I
could
answer
him
one
question
,
which
,
however
,
he
say
he
would
not
press
me
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
answer
it
honestly
;
whether
it
would
be
to
his
satisfaction
or
not
,
that
I
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
my
dear
,
tell
me
plainly
,
"
say
he
,
"
will
the
little
you
have
keep
us
together
in
any
figure
,
or
in
any
station
or
place
,
or
will
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
happiness
hitherto
that
I
have
not
discover
myself
or
my
circumstance
at
all
 
no
,
not
so
much
as
my
name
;
and
see
these
be
nothing
to
be
expect
from
him
,
however
good
-
humoured
and
however
honest
he
seem
to
be
,
but
to
live
on
what
I
know
would
soon
be
waste
,
I
resolve
to
conceal
everything
but
the
bank
bill
and
the
eleven
guinea
which
I
have
own
;
and
I
would
have
be
very
glad
to
have
lose
that
and
have
be
set
down
where
he
take
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
another
bank
bill
about
me
of
#
#
#
#
30
,
which
be
the
whole
of
what
I
bring
with
me
,
as
well
to
subsist
on
in
the
country
,
as
not
know
what
may
offer
;
because
this
creature
,
the
go
-
between
that
have
thus
betray
us
both
,
have
make
me
believe
strange
thing
of
my
marrying
to
my
advantage
in
the
country
,
and
I
be
not
willing
to
be
without
money
,
whatever
may
happen
.
 
<EOS>
this
bill
I
conceal
,
and
that
make
me
the
free
of
the
rest
,
in
consideration
of
his
circumstance
,
for
I
really
pity
him
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
his
question
,
I
tell
him
I
never
willingly
deceive
him
,
and
I
never
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
to
tell
him
that
the
little
I
have
would
not
subsist
us
;
that
it
be
not
sufficient
to
subsist
me
alone
in
the
south
country
,
and
that
this
be
the
reason
that
make
me
put
myself
into
the
hand
of
that
woman
who
call
him
brother
<EOS>
,
she
have
assure
me
that
I
may
board
very
handsomely
at
a
town
call
Manchester
,
where
I
have
not
yet
be
,
for
about
#
#
#
#
6
a
year
;
and
my
whole
income
not
be
about
#
#
#
#
15
a
year
,
I
think
I
may
live
easy
upon
it
,
and
wait
for
well
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
and
remain
silent
,
and
a
very
melancholy
evening
we
have
;
however
,
we
sup
together
,
and
lie
together
that
night
,
and
when
we
have
almost
sup
he
look
a
little
well
and
more
cheerful
,
and
call
for
a
bottle
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
though
the
case
be
bad
,
it
be
to
no
purpose
to
be
deject
.
 
<EOS>
come
,
be
as
easy
as
you
can
;
I
will
endeavour
to
find
out
some
way
or
other
to
live
;
if
you
can
but
subsist
yourself
,
that
be
well
than
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
try
the
world
again
;
a
man
ought
to
think
like
a
man
;
to
be
discourage
be
to
yield
to
the
misfortune
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
this
he
fill
a
glass
and
drink
to
me
,
hold
my
hand
and
press
it
hard
in
his
hand
all
the
while
the
wine
go
down
,
and
protest
afterwards
his
main
concern
be
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
really
a
true
,
gallant
spirit
he
be
of
,
and
it
be
the
more
grievous
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
something
of
relief
even
to
be
undo
by
a
man
of
honour
,
rather
than
by
a
scoundrel
;
but
here
the
great
disappointment
be
on
his
side
,
for
he
have
really
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
,
delude
by
this
madam
the
procuress
;
and
it
be
very
remarkable
on
what
poor
term
he
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
first
the
baseness
of
the
creature
herself
be
to
be
observe
,
who
,
for
the
get
#
#
#
#
100
herself
,
could
be
content
to
let
him
spend
three
or
four
more
,
though
perhaps
it
be
all
he
have
in
the
world
,
and
more
than
all
;
when
she
have
not
the
least
ground
,
more
than
a
little
tea
-
table
chat
,
to
say
that
I
have
any
estate
,
or
be
a
fortune
,
or
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
the
design
of
delude
a
woman
of
fortune
,
if
I
have
be
so
,
be
base
enough
;
<EOS>
the
put
the
face
of
great
thing
upon
poor
circumstance
be
a
fraud
,
and
bad
enough
;
but
the
case
a
little
differed
too
,
and
that
in
his
favour
,
for
he
be
not
a
rake
that
make
a
trade
to
delude
woman
,
and
,
as
some
have
do
,
get
six
or
seven
fortune
after
one
another
,
and
then
rifle
and
run
away
from
them
;
but
he
be
really
a
gentleman
,
unfortunate
and
low
,
but
have
live
well
;
and
though
,
if
I
have
have
a
fortune
,
I
should
have
be
enrage
at
the
slut
for
betray
me
,
yet
really
for
the
man
,
a
fortune
would
not
have
be
ill
bestow
on
him
,
for
he
be
a
lovely
person
indeed
,
of
generous
principle
,
good
sense
,
and
of
abundance
of
good
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
deal
of
close
conversation
that
night
,
for
we
neither
of
us
sleep
much
;
he
be
as
penitent
for
have
put
all
those
cheat
upon
me
as
if
it
have
be
felony
,
and
that
he
be
go
to
execution
;
he
offer
me
again
every
shilling
of
the
money
he
have
about
him
,
and
say
he
would
go
into
the
army
and
seek
the
world
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
why
he
would
be
so
unkind
to
carry
me
into
Ireland
,
when
I
may
suppose
he
could
not
have
subsist
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
me
in
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
depend
upon
it
,
I
never
design
to
go
to
Ireland
at
all
,
much
less
to
have
carry
you
thither
,
but
come
hither
to
be
out
of
the
observation
of
the
people
,
who
have
hear
what
I
pretend
to
,
and
withal
,
that
nobody
may
ask
me
for
money
before
I
be
furnish
to
supply
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
where
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
we
to
have
go
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
confess
the
whole
scheme
to
you
as
I
have
lay
it
;
I
purpose
here
to
ask
you
something
about
your
estate
,
as
you
see
I
do
,
and
when
you
,
as
I
expect
you
would
,
have
enter
into
some
account
with
me
of
the
particular
,
I
would
have
make
an
excuse
to
you
to
have
put
off
our
voyage
to
Ireland
for
some
time
,
and
to
have
go
first
towards
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
resolve
to
have
confess
all
the
circumstance
of
my
own
affair
to
you
,
and
let
you
know
I
have
indeed
make
use
of
these
artifice
to
obtain
your
consent
to
marry
me
,
but
have
now
nothing
to
do
but
ask
to
your
pardon
,
and
to
tell
you
how
abundantly
,
as
I
have
say
above
,
I
would
endeavour
to
make
you
forget
what
be
past
,
by
the
felicity
of
the
day
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
truly
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
"
I
find
you
would
soon
have
conquer
me
;
and
it
be
my
affliction
now
,
that
I
be
not
in
a
condition
to
let
you
see
how
easily
I
should
have
be
reconcile
to
you
,
and
have
pass
by
all
the
trick
you
have
put
upon
me
,
in
recompense
of
so
much
good
-
humour

<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
can
we
do
now
?
 
<EOS>
We
be
both
undone
,
and
what
well
be
we
for
our
be
reconcile
together
,
see
we
have
nothing
to
live
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
propose
a
great
many
thing
,
but
nothing
could
offer
where
there
be
nothing
to
begin
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
beg
me
at
last
to
talk
no
more
of
it
,
for
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
I
would
break
his
heart
;
so
we
talk
of
other
thing
a
little
,
till
at
last
he
take
a
husband
's
leave
of
me
,
and
so
we
go
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
He
rise
before
me
in
the
morning
;
and
indeed
,
have
lain
awake
almost
all
night
,
I
be
very
sleepy
,
and
lie
till
near
eleven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
time
he
take
his
horse
and
three
servant
,
and
all
his
linen
and
baggage
,
and
away
he
go
,
leave
a
short
but
move
letter
for
me
on
the
table
,
as
follow
:
    
"
<EOS>
my
DEAR
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
dog
;
I
have
abuse
you
;
but
I
have
be
draw
into
do
it
by
a
base
creature
,
contrary
to
my
principle
and
the
general
practice
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
forgive
me
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
with
the
great
sincerity
;
I
be
the
most
miserable
of
man
,
in
have
delude
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
happy
to
posse
you
,
and
now
be
so
wretched
as
to
be
force
to
fly
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
forgive
me
,
my
dear
;
once
more
I
say
,
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
able
to
see
you
ruin
by
me
,
and
myself
unable
to
support
you
.
 
<EOS>
Our
marriage
be
nothing
;
I
shall
never
be
able
to
see
you
again
;
I
here
discharge
you
from
it
;
if
you
can
marry
to
your
advantage
,
do
not
decline
it
on
my
account
;
I
here
swear
to
you
on
my
faith
,
and
on
the
word
of
a
man
of
honour
,
I
will
never
disturb
your
repose
if
I
should
know
of
it
,
which
,
however
,
be
not
likely
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
if
you
should
not
marry
,
and
if
good
fortune
should
befall
me
,
it
shall
be
all
your
,
wherever
you
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
put
some
of
the
stock
of
money
I
have
leave
into
your
pocket
;
take
place
for
yourself
and
your
maid
in
the
stage
-
coach
,
and
go
for
London
;
I
hope
it
will
bear
your
charge
thither
,
without
break
into
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
again
I
sincerely
ask
your
pardon
,
and
will
do
so
as
often
as
I
shall
ever
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
Adieu
,
my
dear
,
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
your
most
affectionately
,
J.E.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
that
ever
befall
me
in
my
life
sink
so
deep
into
my
heart
as
this
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
I
reproach
him
a
thousand
time
in
my
thought
for
leave
me
,
for
I
would
have
go
with
him
through
the
world
,
if
I
have
beg
my
bread
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
in
my
pocket
,
and
there
find
ten
guinea
,
his
gold
watch
,
and
two
little
ring
,
one
a
small
diamond
ring
worth
only
about
#
#
#
#
6
,
and
the
other
a
plain
gold
ring
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
me
down
and
look
upon
these
thing
two
hour
together
,
and
scarce
speak
a
word
,
till
my
maid
interrupt
me
by
tell
me
my
dinner
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
I
eat
but
little
,
and
after
dinner
I
fall
into
a
vehement
fit
of
crying
,
every
now
and
then
call
him
by
his
name
,
which
be
James
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
Jemmy
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
come
back
,
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
all
I
have
<EOS>
;
I
will
beg
,
I
will
starve
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
thus
I
run
rave
about
the
room
several
time
,
and
then
sit
down
between
while
,
and
then
walk
about
again
,
call
upon
him
to
come
back
,
and
then
cry
again
;
and
thus
I
pass
the
afternoon
,
till
about
seven
o'clock
,
when
it
be
near
dusk
,
in
the
evening
,
be
August
,
when
,
to
my
unspeakable
surprise
,
he
come
back
into
the
inn
,
but
without
a
servant
,
and
come
directly
up
into
my
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
great
confusion
imaginable
,
and
so
be
he
too
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
imagine
what
should
be
the
occasion
of
it
,
and
begin
to
be
at
odd
with
myself
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
;
but
my
affection
bias
all
the
rest
,
and
it
be
impossible
to
conceal
my
joy
,
which
be
too
great
for
smile
,
for
it
burst
out
into
tear
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
enter
the
room
<EOS>
but
he
run
to
me
and
take
me
in
his
arm
,
hold
me
fast
,
and
almost
stop
my
breath
with
his
kiss
,
but
speak
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
at
length
I
begin
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
how
could
you
go
away
from
me
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
he
give
no
answer
,
for
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
when
our
ecstasy
be
a
little
over
,
he
tell
me
he
be
go
about
fifteen
mile
,
but
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
go
any
farther
without
come
back
to
see
me
again
,
and
to
take
his
leave
of
me
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
how
I
have
pass
my
time
,
and
how
loud
I
have
call
him
to
come
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
hear
me
very
plain
upon
Delamere
Forest
,
at
a
place
about
twelve
mile
off
.
<EOS>
I
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
think
I
be
in
jest
,
for
<EOS>
if
ever
I
hear
your
voice
in
my
life
,
I
hear
you
call
me
aloud
,
and
sometimes
I
think
I
see
you
run
after
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
do
I
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
not
name
the
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
call
aloud
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
say
,
o
Jemmy
!
 
<EOS>
o
Jemmy
!
<EOS>
come
back
,
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
laugh
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
laugh
,
for
,
depend
upon
it
,
I
hear
your
voice
as
plain
as
you
hear
mine
now
;
if
you
please
,
I
will
go
before
a
magistrate
and
make
oath
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
then
begin
to
be
amazed
and
surprised
,
and
indeed
frighten
,
and
tell
him
what
I
have
really
do
,
and
how
I
have
call
after
him
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
amuse
ourselves
a
while
about
this
,
I
say
to
him
:
 
"
<EOS>
well
,
you
shall
go
away
from
me
no
more
;
I
will
go
all
over
the
world
with
you
rather
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
it
would
be
very
difficult
thing
for
him
to
leave
me
,
but
since
it
must
be
,
he
hope
I
would
make
it
as
easy
to
me
as
I
could
;
but
as
for
him
,
it
would
be
his
destruction
that
he
foresee
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
tell
me
that
he
consider
he
have
leave
me
to
travel
to
London
alone
,
which
be
too
long
a
journey
;
and
that
as
he
may
as
well
go
that
way
as
any
way
else
,
he
be
resolve
to
see
me
safe
thither
,
or
near
it
;
and
if
he
do
go
away
then
without
take
his
leave
,
I
should
not
take
it
ill
of
him
;
and
this
he
make
me
promise
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
how
he
have
dismiss
his
three
servant
,
sell
their
horse
,
and
send
the
fellow
away
to
seek
their
fortune
,
and
all
in
a
little
time
,
at
a
town
on
the
road
,
I
know
not
where
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
cost
me
some
tear
all
alone
by
myself
,
to
think
how
much
happy
they
be
than
their
master
,
for
they
could
go
to
the
next
gentleman
's
house
to
see
for
a
service
,
whereas
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
know
not
wither
to
go
,
or
what
to
do
with
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
so
completely
miserable
in
part
with
him
,
that
I
could
not
be
bad
;
and
that
now
he
be
come
again
<EOS>
,
I
would
not
go
from
him
,
if
he
would
take
me
with
him
,
let
him
go
whither
he
would
,
or
do
what
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
meantime
I
agree
that
we
would
go
together
to
London
;
but
I
could
not
be
bring
to
consent
he
should
go
away
at
last
and
not
take
his
leave
of
me
,
as
he
propose
to
do
;
but
tell
him
,
jest
,
that
if
he
do
,
I
would
call
him
back
again
as
loud
as
I
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
pull
out
his
watch
and
give
it
him
back
,
and
his
two
ring
,
and
his
ten
guinea
;
but
he
would
not
take
them
,
which
make
me
very
much
suspect
that
he
resolve
to
go
off
upon
the
road
and
leave
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
the
circumstance
he
be
in
,
the
passionate
expression
of
his
letter
,
the
kind
,
gentlemanly
treatment
I
have
from
him
in
all
the
affair
,
with
the
concern
he
show
for
me
in
it
,
his
manner
of
part
with
that
large
share
which
he
give
me
of
his
little
stock
leave
 
all
these
have
join
to
make
such
impression
on
me
,
that
I
really
love
him
most
tenderly
,
and
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
part
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
after
this
we
quit
Chester
,
I
in
the
stage
-
coach
,
and
he
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
I
dismiss
my
maid
at
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
against
my
being
without
a
maid
,
but
she
be
a
servant
hire
in
the
country
,
and
I
resolve
to
keep
no
servant
at
London
<EOS>
,
I
tell
him
it
would
have
be
barbarous
to
have
take
the
poor
wench
and
have
turn
her
away
as
soon
as
I
come
to
town
;
and
it
would
also
have
be
a
needless
charge
on
the
road
,
so
I
satisfy
him
,
and
he
be
easy
enough
on
the
score
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
with
me
as
far
as
Dunstable
,
within
thirty
mile
of
London
,
and
then
he
tell
me
fate
and
his
own
misfortune
oblige
him
to
leave
me
,
and
that
it
be
not
convenient
for
him
to
go
to
London
,
for
reason
which
it
be
of
no
value
to
me
to
know
,
and
I
see
him
prepare
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
stage
-
coach
we
be
in
do
not
usually
stop
at
Dunstable
,
but
I
desire
it
but
for
a
quart
of
an
hour
,
they
be
content
to
stand
at
an
inndoor
a
while
,
and
we
go
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
be
in
the
inn
,
I
tell
him
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
favour
more
to
ask
of
him
,
and
that
be
,
that
since
he
could
not
go
any
farther
,
he
would
give
me
leave
to
stay
a
week
or
two
in
the
town
with
him
,
that
we
may
in
that
time
think
of
something
to
prevent
such
a
ruinous
thing
to
us
both
,
as
a
final
separation
would
be
;
and
that
I
have
something
of
moment
to
offer
him
,
that
I
have
never
say
yet
,
and
which
perhaps
he
may
find
practicable
to
our
mutual
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
too
reasonable
a
proposal
to
be
deny
,
so
he
call
the
landlady
of
the
house
,
and
tell
her
his
wife
be
take
ill
,
and
so
ill
that
she
could
not
think
of
go
any
farther
in
the
stage
-
coach
,
which
have
tire
her
almost
to
death
,
and
ask
if
she
could
not
get
us
a
lodging
for
two
or
three
day
in
a
private
house
,
where
I
may
rest
me
a
little
,
for
the
journey
have
be
too
much
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
a
good
sort
of
woman
,
well
-
breed
and
very
obliging
,
come
immediately
to
see
me
;
tell
me
she
have
two
or
three
very
good
room
in
a
part
of
the
house
quite
out
of
the
noise
,
and
if
I
see
them
,
she
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
would
like
them
,
and
I
should
have
one
of
her
maid
,
that
should
do
nothing
else
but
be
appoint
to
wait
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
so
very
kind
,
that
I
could
not
but
accept
of
it
,
and
thank
her
;
so
I
go
to
look
on
the
room
and
like
them
very
well
,
and
indeed
they
be
extraordinarily
furnished
,
and
very
pleasant
lodging
;
so
we
pay
the
stage
-
coach
,
take
out
our
baggage
,
and
resolve
to
stay
here
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
tell
him
I
would
live
with
him
now
till
all
my
money
be
spend
,
but
would
not
let
him
spend
a
shilling
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
We
have
some
kind
squabble
about
that
,
but
I
tell
him
it
be
the
last
time
I
be
like
to
enjoy
his
company
,
and
I
desire
he
would
let
me
be
master
in
that
thing
only
,
and
he
should
govern
in
everything
else
;
so
he
acquiesce
.
  
<EOS>
here
one
evening
,
take
a
walk
into
the
field
,
I
tell
him
I
would
now
make
the
proposal
to
him
I
have
tell
him
of
;
accordingly
I
relate
to
him
how
I
have
live
in
Virginia
,
that
I
have
a
mother
I
believe
be
alive
there
still
,
though
my
husband
be
dead
some
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
have
not
my
effect
miscarry
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
magnify
pretty
much
,
I
may
have
be
fortune
good
enough
to
him
to
have
keep
us
from
be
part
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
enter
into
the
manner
of
people
go
over
to
those
country
to
settle
,
how
they
have
a
quantity
of
land
give
them
by
the
Constitution
of
the
place
;
and
if
not
,
that
it
may
be
purchase
at
so
easy
a
rate
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
it
be
not
worth
name
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
give
him
a
full
and
distinct
account
of
the
nature
of
planting
;
how
with
carry
over
but
two
or
three
hundred
pound
value
in
english
good
,
with
some
servant
and
tool
,
a
man
of
application
would
presently
lay
a
foundation
for
a
family
,
and
in
a
very
few
year
be
certain
to
raise
an
estate
.
  
<EOS>
I
let
him
into
the
nature
of
the
product
of
the
earth
;
how
the
ground
be
cure
and
prepare
,
and
what
the
usual
increase
of
it
be
;
and
demonstrate
to
him
,
that
in
a
very
few
year
,
with
such
a
beginning
,
we
should
be
as
certain
of
be
rich
as
we
be
now
certain
of
be
poor
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
surprised
at
my
discourse
;
for
we
make
it
the
whole
subject
of
our
conversation
for
near
a
week
together
,
in
which
time
I
lay
it
down
in
black
and
white
,
as
we
say
,
that
it
be
morally
impossible
,
with
a
supposition
of
any
reasonable
good
conduct
,
but
that
we
must
thrive
there
and
do
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
tell
him
what
measure
I
would
take
to
raise
such
a
sum
of
#
#
#
#
300
or
thereabout
;
and
I
argue
with
him
how
good
a
method
<EOS>
it
would
be
to
put
an
end
to
our
misfortune
and
restore
our
circumstance
in
the
world
,
to
what
we
have
both
expect
;
and
I
add
,
that
after
seven
year
,
if
we
live
,
we
may
be
in
a
posture
to
leave
our
plantation
in
good
hand
,
and
come
over
again
and
receive
the
income
of
it
,
and
live
here
and
enjoy
it
;
and
I
give
him
example
of
some
that
have
do
so
,
and
live
now
in
very
good
circumstance
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
press
him
so
to
it
,
that
he
almost
agree
to
it
,
but
<EOS>
still
something
or
other
break
it
off
again
;
till
at
last
he
turn
the
table
,
and
he
begin
to
talk
almost
to
the
same
purpose
of
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
a
man
that
could
confine
himself
to
country
life
,
and
that
could
find
but
stock
to
enter
upon
any
land
,
should
have
farm
there
for
#
#
#
#
50
a
year
,
as
good
as
be
here
let
for
#
#
#
#
200
a
year
;
that
the
produce
be
such
,
and
so
rich
the
land
,
that
if
much
be
not
lay
up
,
we
be
sure
to
live
as
handsomely
upon
it
as
a
gentleman
of
#
#
#
#
3000
a
year
could
do
in
England
and
that
he
have
lay
a
scheme
to
leave
me
in
London
,
and
go
over
and
try
;
and
if
he
find
he
could
lay
a
handsome
foundation
of
live
suitable
to
the
respect
he
have
for
me
,
as
he
doubt
not
he
should
do
,
he
would
come
over
and
fetch
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
dreadfully
afraid
that
upon
such
a
proposal
he
would
have
take
me
at
my
word
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
sell
my
little
income
as
I
call
it
,
and
turn
it
into
money
,
and
let
him
carry
it
over
into
Ireland
and
try
his
experiment
with
it
;
but
he
be
too
just
to
desire
it
,
or
to
have
accept
it
if
I
have
offer
it
;
and
he
anticipate
me
in
that
,
for
he
add
,
that
he
would
go
and
try
his
fortune
that
way
,
and
if
he
find
he
could
do
anything
at
it
to
live
,
then
,
by
add
mine
to
it
when
I
go
over
,
we
should
live
like
ourselves
;
but
that
he
would
not
hazard
a
shilling
of
mine
till
he
have
make
the
experiment
with
a
little
,
and
he
assure
me
that
if
he
find
nothing
to
be
do
in
Ireland
,
he
would
then
come
to
me
and
join
in
my
project
for
Virginia
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
earnest
upon
his
project
be
to
be
try
first
,
that
I
could
not
withstand
him
;
however
,
he
promise
to
let
me
hear
from
him
in
a
very
little
time
after
his
arrive
there
,
to
let
me
know
whether
his
prospect
answer
his
design
,
that
if
there
be
not
a
possibility
of
success
,
I
may
take
the
occasion
to
prepare
for
our
other
voyage
,
and
then
,
he
assure
me
,
he
would
go
with
me
to
America
with
all
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
bring
him
to
nothing
further
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
those
consultation
entertain
us
near
a
month
,
during
which
I
enjoy
his
company
,
which
indeed
be
the
most
entertaining
that
ever
I
meet
in
my
life
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
time
he
let
me
into
the
whole
story
of
his
own
life
,
which
be
indeed
surprising
,
and
full
of
an
infinite
variety
sufficient
to
fill
up
a
much
bright
history
,
for
its
adventure
and
incident
,
than
any
I
ever
say
in
print
;
but
I
shall
have
occasion
to
say
more
of
him
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
We
part
at
last
,
though
with
the
utmost
reluctance
on
my
side
;
and
indeed
he
take
his
leave
very
unwillingly
too
,
but
necessity
oblige
him
,
for
his
reason
be
very
good
why
he
would
not
come
to
London
,
as
I
understand
more
fully
some
time
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
direction
how
to
write
to
me
,
though
still
I
reserve
the
grand
secret
,
and
never
break
my
resolution
,
which
be
not
to
let
him
ever
know
my
true
name
,
who
I
be
,
or
where
to
be
find
;
he
likewise
let
me
know
how
to
write
a
letter
to
him
,
so
that
,
he
say
,
he
would
be
sure
to
receive
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
to
London
the
next
day
after
we
part
,
but
do
not
go
directly
to
my
old
lodging
;
but
for
another
nameless
reason
take
a
private
lodging
in
St.
John
's
Street
,
or
,
as
it
be
vulgarly
call
,
St.
Jones
's
,
near
Clerkenwell
;
and
here
,
be
perfectly
alone
<EOS>
,
I
have
leisure
to
sit
down
and
reflect
seriously
upon
the
last
seven
month
'
ramble
I
have
make
,
for
I
have
be
abroad
no
less
.
 
<EOS>
the
pleasant
hour
I
have
with
my
last
husband
I
look
back
on
with
an
infinite
deal
of
pleasure
;
but
that
pleasure
be
very
much
lessen
when
I
find
some
time
after
that
I
be
really
with
child
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
perplexing
thing
,
because
of
the
difficulty
which
be
before
me
where
I
should
get
leave
to
lie
in
;
it
be
one
of
the
nice
thing
in
the
world
at
that
time
of
day
for
a
woman
that
be
a
stranger
,
and
have
no
friend
,
to
be
entertain
in
that
circumstance
without
security
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
have
not
,
<EOS>
neither
could
I
procure
any
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
take
care
all
this
while
to
preserve
a
correspondence
with
my
honest
friend
at
the
bank
,
or
rather
he
take
care
to
correspond
with
me
,
for
he
write
to
me
once
a
week
;
and
though
I
have
not
spend
my
money
so
fast
as
to
want
any
from
him
,
yet
I
often
write
also
to
let
him
know
I
be
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
leave
direction
in
Lancashire
,
so
that
I
have
these
letter
,
which
he
send
,
convey
to
me
;
and
during
my
recess
at
St.
Jones
's
receive
a
very
obliging
letter
from
him
,
assure
me
that
his
process
for
a
divorce
from
his
wife
go
on
with
success
,
though
he
meet
with
some
difficulty
in
it
that
he
do
not
expect
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
displeased
with
the
news
that
his
process
be
more
tedious
than
he
expect
;
for
though
I
be
in
no
condition
to
have
him
yet
,
not
be
so
foolish
to
marry
him
when
I
know
myself
to
be
with
child
by
another
man
,
as
some
I
know
have
venture
to
do
,
yet
I
be
not
willing
to
lose
him
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
resolve
to
have
him
if
he
continue
in
the
same
mind
,
as
soon
as
I
be
up
again
;
for
I
see
apparently
<EOS>
I
should
hear
no
more
from
my
husband
;
and
as
he
have
all
along
press
to
marry
,
and
have
assure
me
he
would
not
be
at
all
disgust
at
it
,
or
ever
offer
to
claim
me
again
,
so
I
make
no
scruple
to
resolve
to
do
it
if
I
could
,
and
if
my
other
friend
stand
to
his
bargain
;
and
I
have
a
great
deal
of
reason
to
be
assure
that
he
would
stand
to
it
,
by
the
letter
he
write
to
me
,
which
be
the
kind
and
most
obliging
that
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
grow
big
,
and
the
people
where
I
lodge
perceive
it
,
and
begin
to
take
notice
of
it
to
me
,
and
,
as
far
as
civility
would
allow
,
intimate
that
I
must
think
of
remove
.
 
<EOS>
this
put
me
to
extreme
perplexity
,
and
I
grow
very
melancholy
,
for
indeed
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
course
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
money
,
but
no
friend
,
and
be
like
to
have
a
child
upon
my
hand
to
keep
,
which
be
a
difficulty
I
have
never
have
upon
me
yet
,
as
the
particular
of
my
story
hitherto
make
appear
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
affair
I
fall
very
ill
,
and
my
melancholy
really
increase
my
distemper
;
my
illness
prove
at
length
to
be
only
an
ague
,
but
my
apprehension
be
really
that
I
should
miscarry
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
say
apprehension
,
<EOS>
for
indeed
I
would
have
be
glad
to
miscarry
,
but
I
could
never
be
bring
to
entertain
so
much
as
a
thought
of
endeavour
to
miscarry
,
or
of
take
any
thing
to
make
me
miscarry
;
I
abhor
,
I
say
,
so
much
as
the
thought
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
speak
of
it
in
the
house
,
the
gentlewoman
who
keep
the
house
propose
to
me
to
send
for
a
midwife
.
 
<EOS>
I
scruple
it
at
first
,
but
after
some
time
consent
to
it
,
but
tell
her
I
have
no
particular
acquaintance
with
any
midwife
,
and
so
leave
it
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
the
mistress
of
the
house
be
not
so
great
a
stranger
to
such
case
as
mine
be
as
I
think
at
first
she
have
be
,
as
will
appear
presently
,
and
she
send
for
a
midwife
of
the
right
sort
 
that
be
to
say
,
the
right
sort
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
appear
to
be
an
experienced
woman
in
her
business
,
I
mean
as
a
midwife
;
but
she
have
another
calling
too
,
in
which
she
be
as
expert
as
most
woman
if
not
more
.
 
<EOS>
My
landlady
have
tell
her
I
be
very
melancholy
,
and
that
she
believe
that
have
do
me
harm
;
and
once
,
before
me
,
say
to
her
,
"
Mrs.
B
#
#
#
#
"
(
<EOS>
mean
the
midwife
)
,
"
I
believe
this
lady
's
trouble
be
of
a
kind
that
be
pretty
much
in
your
way
,
and
therefore
if
you
can
do
anything
for
her
,
pray
do
,
for
she
be
a
very
civil
gentlewoman
'
;
and
so
she
go
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
understand
her
,
but
my
Mother
Midnight
begin
very
seriously
to
explain
what
she
mean
,
as
soon
as
she
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
seem
not
to
understand
what
your
landlady
mean
;
and
when
you
do
understand
it
,
you
need
not
let
her
know
at
all
that
you
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
mean
that
you
be
under
some
circumstance
that
may
render
your
lying
in
difficult
to
you
,
and
that
you
be
not
willing
to
be
expose
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
say
no
more
,
but
to
tell
you
,
that
if
you
think
fit
to
communicate
so
much
of
your
case
to
me
,
if
it
be
so
,
as
be
necessary
,
for
I
do
not
desire
to
pry
into
those
thing
,
I
perhaps
may
be
in
a
position
to
help
you
and
to
make
you
perfectly
easy
,
and
remove
all
your
dull
thought
upon
that
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
every
word
this
creature
say
be
a
cordial
to
me
,
and
put
new
life
and
new
spirit
into
my
heart
;
my
blood
begin
to
circulate
immediately
,
and
I
be
quite
another
body
;
I
eat
my
victual
again
,
and
grow
better
presently
after
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
and
then
,
have
press
me
to
be
free
with
her
,
and
promise
in
the
solemn
manner
to
be
secret
,
she
stop
a
little
,
as
if
wait
to
see
what
impression
it
make
on
me
,
and
what
I
would
say
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
too
sensible
to
the
want
I
be
in
of
such
a
woman
,
not
to
accept
her
offer
;
I
tell
her
my
case
be
partly
as
she
guess
,
and
partly
not
,
for
I
be
really
married
,
and
have
a
husband
,
though
he
be
in
such
fine
circumstance
and
so
remote
at
that
time
,
as
that
he
could
not
appear
publicly
.
  
<EOS>
She
take
me
short
,
and
tell
me
that
be
none
of
her
business
;
all
the
lady
that
come
under
her
care
be
marry
woman
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
every
woman
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
be
with
child
have
a
father
for
it
,
"
and
whether
that
father
be
a
husband
or
no
husband
,
be
no
business
of
her
;
her
business
be
to
assist
me
in
my
present
circumstance
,
whether
I
have
a
husband
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
to
have
a
husband
that
can
not
appear
,
be
to
have
no
husband
in
the
sense
of
the
case
;
and
,
therefore
,
whether
you
be
a
wife
or
a
mistress
be
all
one
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
find
presently
,
that
whether
I
be
a
whore
or
a
wife
,
I
be
to
pass
for
a
whore
here
,
so
I
let
that
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
it
be
true
,
as
she
say
,
but
that
,
however
,
if
I
must
tell
her
my
case
,
I
must
tell
it
her
as
it
be
;
so
I
relate
it
to
her
as
short
as
I
could
,
and
I
conclude
it
to
her
thus
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
trouble
you
with
all
this
,
madam
,
"
say
I
,
"
not
that
,
as
you
say
before
,
it
be
much
to
the
purpose
in
your
affair
,
but
this
be
to
the
purpose
,
namely
,
that
I
be
not
in
any
pain
about
be
see
,
or
be
public
or
conceal
,
for
'
tis
perfectly
indifferent
to
me
;
but
my
difficulty
be
,
that
I
have
no
acquaintance
in
this
part
of

My

,
"
Madam

I

I
thank
God

so
far
as
may

necessary

though
I
do
not
abound
in
that
neither
"
:
 
this
I
add
because
I
would
not
make
her
expect
great
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
madam

"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
that
be
the
thing
indeed

without
which
nothing

do
in

yet
,
"
say
she

"
you
shall
see
that
I
will
not
impose
upon
you

offer
anything

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
she
seem
to
be
so
perfectly
sensible
of
my
condition
,
that
I
have
nothing
to
ask
of
her
<EOS>

this
,
that
as
I
have
tell
her
that
I
have
money
sufficient
,
but
not
a
great
quantity
,
she
would
order
it
so
that
I
may
be
at
as
little
superfluous
charge
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
She
reply
that
she
would
bring
in
an
account
of
the
expense
of
it
in
two
or
three
shape
,

like
a

I

I

I

see
but
that
she
be
very
reasonable
in
her
demand

all
thing
consider
,
and
for
that
I
do
not
doubt
but
her
accommodation
be
good

<EOS>
She
tell
me
I
should
be
judge
of
that
when
I
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
be
sorry
to
tell
her
that
I
fear
I
must
be
her
lowest
-
rate
customer

<EOS>
"
and
perhaps
,
madam

"
say
I
,
"
you
will
make
me
the
less
welcome
upon
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
at
all
,
"
say
she
;
"
for
where
I
have
one
of
the
third
sort
I
have
two
of
the
second
,
and
four
to
one
of
the
first
,
and
I
get
as
much
by
them
in
proportion
as
by
any
;
but
if
you
doubt
my
care
of
you
,
I
will
allow
any
friend
you
have
to
overlook
and
see
if
you
be
well
wait
on
or
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
she
explain
the
particular
of
her
bill
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
observe
that
here
be
three
month
"
keep
;
you
be
but
ten
shilling
a
week
;
I
undertake
to
say
you
will
not
complain
of
my
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
do
not
live
cheap
where
you
be
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
say
I
,
"
not
so
cheap
,
for
I
give
six
shilling
per
week
for
my
chamber
,
and
find
my
own
diet
as
well
as
I
can
,
which
cost
me
a
great
deal
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
if
the
child
should
not
live
,
or
should
be
dead
-
bear
,
as
you
know
sometimes
happen
,
then
there
be
the
minister
's
article
save
;
and
if
you
have
no
friend
to
come
to
you
,
you
may
save
the
expense
of
a
supper
;
so
that
take
those
article
out
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
your
lying
in
will
not
cost
you
above
#
#
#
#
5
,
3s
.
<EOS>
in
all
more
than
your
ordinary
charge
of
 
living
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
most
reasonable
thing
that
I
ever
hear
of
;
so
I
smile
,
and
tell
her
I
would
come
and
be
her
customer
;
but
I
tell
her
also
,
that
as
I
have
two
month
and
more
to
do
,
I
may
perhaps
be
oblige
to
stay
longer
with
her
than
three
month
,
and
desire
to
know
if
she
would
not
be
oblige
to
remove
me
before
it
be
proper
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
she
say
;
her
house
be
large
,
and
besides
,
she
never
put
anybody
to
remove
,
that
have
lain
in
,
till
they
be
willing
to
go
;
and
if
she
have
more
lady
offer
,
she
be
not
so
ill
-
beloved
among
her
neighbour
<EOS>
but
she
could
provide
accommodation
for
twenty
,
if
there
be
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
she
be
an
eminent
lady
in
her
way
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
agree
to
put
myself
into
her
hand
,
and
promise
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
talk
of
other
thing
,
look
about
into
my
accommodation
where
I
be
,
find
fault
with
my
wanting
attendance
and
convenience
,
and
that
I
should
not
be
use
so
at
her
house
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
be
shy
of
speak
,
for
the
woman
of
the
house
look
strange
,
or
at
least
I
think
so
,
since
I
have
be
ill
,
because
I
be
with
child
;
and
I
be
afraid
she
would
put
some
affront
or
other
upon
me
,
suppose
that
I
have
be
able
to
give
but
a
slight
account
of
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
her
ladyship
be
no
stranger
to
these
thing
;
she
have
try
to
entertain
lady
in
your
condition
several
time
,
but
she
could
not
secure
the
parish
;
and
besides
,
she
be
not
such
a
nice
lady
as
you
take
her
to
be
;
however
,
since
you
be
a
-
going
,
you
shall
not
meddle
with
her
,
but
I
will
see
you
be
a
little
better
look
after
while
you
be
here
than
I
think
you
be
,
and
it
shall
not
cost
you
the
more
neither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
her
at
all
;
however
,
I
thank
her
,
and
 
so
we
part
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
she
send
me
a
chicken
roast
and
hot
,
and
a
pint
bottle
of
sherry
,
and
order
the
maid
to
tell
me
that
she
be
to
wait
on
me
every
day
as
long
as
I
stay
there
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
surprisingly
good
and
kind
,
and
I
accept
it
very
willingly
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
she
send
to
me
again
,
to
know
if
I
want
anything
,
and
how
I
do
,
and
to
order
the
maid
to
come
to
her
in
the
morning
with
my
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
the
maid
 
have
order
to
make
me
some
chocolate
in
the
morning
before
she
come
away
,
and
do
so
,
and
at
noon
she
bring
me
the
sweetbread
of
a
breast
of
veal
,
whole
,
and
a
dish
of
soup
for
my
dinner
;
and
after
this
manner
she
nurse
me
up
at
a
distance
,
so
that
I
be
mightily
well
pleased
,
and
quickly
well
,
<EOS>
for
indeed
my
dejection
before
be
the
principal
part
of
my
illness
.
  
<EOS>
I
expect
,
as
be
usually
the
case
among
such
people
,
that
the
servant
she
send
me
would
have
be
some
imprudent
brazen
wench
of
Drury
Lane
breed
,
and
I
be
very
uneasy
at
have
her
with
me
upon
that
account
;
<EOS>
so
I
would
not
let
her
lie
in
that
house
the
first
night
by
any
mean
,
but
have
my
eye
about
me
as
narrowly
as
if
she
have
be
a
public
thief
.
  
<EOS>
My
gentlewoman
guess
presently
what
be
the
matter
,
and
send
her
back
with
a
short
note
,
that
I
may
depend
upon
the
honesty
of
her
maid
;
that
she
would
be
answerable
for
her
upon
all
account
;
and
that
she
take
no
servant
into
her
house
without
very
good
security
for
their
fidelity
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
then
perfectly
easy
;
and
indeed
the
maid
's
behaviour
speak
for
itself
,
for
a
modester
,
quieter
,
soberer
girl
never
come
into
anybody
's
family
,
and
I
find
her
so
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
be
well
enough
to
go
abroad
,
I
go
with
the
maid
to
see
the
house
,
and
to
see
the
apartment
I
be
to
have
;
and
everything
be
so
handsome
and
so
clean
and
well
,
that
,
in
short
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
be
wonderfully
pleased
and
satisfied
with
what
I
have
meet
with
,
which
,
consider
the
melancholy
circumstance
I
be
in
,
be
far
beyond
what
I
look
for
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
expect
that
I
should
give
some
account
of
the
nature
of
the
wicked
practice
of
this
woman
,
in
whose
hand
I
be
now
fall
;
but
it
would
be
too
much
encouragement
to
the
vice
,
to
let
the
world
see
what
easy
measure
be
here
take
to
rid
the
woman
's
unwelcome
burthen
of
a
child
<EOS>
clandestinely
get
.
 
<EOS>
this
grave
matron
have
several
sort
of
practice
,
and
this
be
one
particular
,
that
if
a
child
be
bear
,
though
not
in
her
house
(
for
she
have
occasion
to
be
call
to
many
private
labour
)
,
she
have
people
at
hand
,
who
for
a
piece
of
money
would
take
the
child
off
their
hand
,
and
off
from
the
hand
of
the
parish
too
;
and
those
child
,
as
she
say
,
be
honestly
provide
for
and
take
care
of
.
 
<EOS>
what
should
become
of
them
all
,
consider
so
many
,
as
by
her
account
<EOS>
she
be
concern
with
,
I
can
not
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
many
time
discourse
upon
that
subject
with
her
;
but
she
be
full
of
this
argument
,
that
she
save
the
life
of
many
an
innocent
lamb
,
as
she
call
them
,
which
would
otherwise
perhaps
have
be
murder
;
and
of
many
woman
who
,
make
desperate
by
the
misfortune
,
would
otherwise
be
tempt
to
destroy
their
child
,
and
bring
themselves
to
the
gallow
.
 
<EOS>
I
grant
her
that
this
be
true
,
and
a
very
commendable
thing
,
<EOS>
provide
the
poor
child
fall
into
good
hand
afterwards
,
and
be
not
abuse
,
starve
,
and
neglect
by
the
nurse
that
breed
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
She
answer
,
that
she
always
take
care
of
that
,
and
have
no
nurse
in
her
business
<EOS>
but
what
be
very
good
,
honest
people
,
and
such
as
may
be
depend
upon
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
say
nothing
to
the
contrary
,
and
so
be
oblige
to
say
,
"
Madam
,
I
do
not
question
you
do
your
part
honestly
,
but
what
those
people
do
afterwards
be
the
main
question
"
;
and
she
stop
my
mouth
again
with
say
that
she
take
the
utmost
care
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
thing
I
find
in
all
her
conversation
on
these
subject
that
give
me
any
distaste
,
be
,
that
one
time
in
discourage
about
my
be
far
go
with
child
,
and
the
time
I
expect
to
come
,
she
say
something
that
look
as
if
she
could
help
me
off
with
my
burthen
sooner
,
if
I
be
willing
;
or
,
in
English
,
that
she
could
give
me
something
to
make
me
miscarry
,
if
I
have
a
desire
to
put
an
end
to
my
trouble
that
way
;
but
I
soon
let
her
see
that
I
abhor
the
thought
of
it
;
and
,
to
do
her
justice
,
she
put
it
off
so
cleverly
,
<EOS>
that
I
could
not
say
she
really
intend
it
,
or
whether
she
only
mention
the
practice
as
a
horrible
thing
;
for
she
couch
her
word
so
well
,
and
take
my
meaning
so
quickly
,
that
she
give
her
negative
before
I
could
explain
myself
.
  
<EOS>
to
bring
this
part
into
as
narrow
a
compass
as
possible
,
I
quit
my
lodging
at
St.
Jones
's
and
go
to
my
new
governess
,
for
<EOS>
so
they
call
her
in
the
house
,
and
there
I
be
indeed
treat
with
so
much
courtesy
,
so
carefully
look
to
,
so
handsomely
provide
,
and
everything
so
well
,
that
I
be
surprised
at
it
,
and
could
not
at
first
see
what
advantage
my
governess
make
of
it
;
but
<EOS>
I
find
afterwards
that
she
profess
to
make
no
profit
of
lodger
'
diet
,
nor
indeed
could
she
get
much
by
it
,
but
that
her
profit
lie
in
the
other
article
of
her
management
,
and
she
make
enough
that
way
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
for
'
tis
scarce
credible
<EOS>
what
practice
she
have
,
as
well
abroad
as
at
home
,
and
yet
all
upon
the
private
account
,
or
,
in
plain
English
,
the
whore
account
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
in
her
house
,
which
be
near
four
month
,
she
have
no
less
than
twelve
lady
of
pleasure
bring
to
bed
within
the
door
,
and
I
think
she
have
two
-
and
-
thirty
,
or
thereabout
,
under
her
conduct
without
door
,
whereof
one
,
<EOS>
as
nice
as
she
be
with
me
,
be
lodge
with
my
old
landlady
at
St.
Jones
's
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
strange
testimony
of
the
grow
vice
of
the
age
,
and
such
a
one
,
that
as
bad
as
I
have
be
myself
,
it
shock
my
very
sense
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
nauseate
the
place
I
be
in
and
,
about
all
,
the
wicked
practice
;
and
yet
I
must
say
that
I
never
see
,
or
<EOS>
do
I
believe
there
be
to
be
see
,
the
least
indecency
in
the
house
the
whole
time
I
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
not
a
man
be
ever
see
to
come
upstairs
,
except
to
visit
the
lying
-
in
lady
within
their
month
,
nor
then
without
the
old
lady
with
them
,
who
make
it
a
piece
of
honour
of
her
management
that
no
man
should
touch
a
woman
,
no
,
not
his
own
wife
,
within
the
month
;
nor
would
she
permit
any
man
to
lie
in
the
house
upon
any
pretence
whatever
,
no
,
not
though
she
be
sure
it
be
with
his
own
wife
;
and
her
general
say
for
it
be
,
that
she
care
not
how
many
child
be
bear
in
her
house
,
but
she
would
have
none
get
there
if
she
could
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
be
carry
further
than
be
needful
,
but
it
be
an
error
of
the
right
hand
if
it
be
an
error
,
for
by
this
she
keep
up
the
reputation
,
such
as
it
be
,
of
her
business
,
and
obtain
this
character
,
that
though
she
do
take
care
of
the
woman
when
they
be
debauch
,
yet
she
be
not
instrumental
to
their
be
debauch
at
all
;
and
yet
it
be
a
wicked
trade
she
drive
too
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
there
,
and
before
I
be
bring
to
bed
,
I
receive
a
letter
from
my
trustee
at
the
bank
,
full
of
kind
,
oblige
thing
,
and
earnestly
press
me
to
return
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
near
a
fortnight
old
when
it
come
to
me
,
because
it
have
be
first
send
into
Lancashire
,
and
then
return
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
conclude
with
tell
me
that
he
have
obtain
a
decree
,
I
think
he
call
it
,
against
his
wife
,
and
that
he
would
be
ready
to
make
good
his
engagement
to
me
,
if
I
would
accept
of
him
,
add
a
great
many
protestation
of
kindness
and
affection
,
such
as
he
would
have
be
far
from
offer
if
he
have
know
the
circumstance
I
have
be
in
,
and
which
as
it
be
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
far
from
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
an
answer
to
his
letter
,
and
date
it
at
Liverpool
,
but
send
it
by
messenger
,
allege
that
it
come
in
cover
to
a
friend
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
joy
of
his
deliverance
,
but
raise
some
scruple
at
the
lawfulness
of
his
marrying
again
,
and
tell
him
I
suppose
he
would
consider
very
seriously
upon
that
point
before
he
resolve
on
it
,
the
consequence
be
too
great
for
a
man
of
his
judgment
to
venture
rashly
upon
a
thing
of
that
nature
;
so
conclude
,
wish
him
very
well
in
whatever
he
resolve
,
without
let
him
into
anything
of
my
own
mind
,
or
give
any
answer
to
his
proposal
of
my
come
to
London
to
him
,
but
mention
at
a
distance
my
intention
to
return
the
latter
end
of
the
year
,
this
be
date
in
April
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
bring
to
bed
about
the
middle
of
May
and
have
another
brave
boy
,
and
myself
in
as
good
condition
as
usual
on
such
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
My
governess
do
her
part
as
a
midwife
with
the
great
art
and
dexterity
imaginable
,
and
far
beyond
all
that
ever
I
have
have
any
experience
of
before
.
  
<EOS>
Her
care
of
me
in
my
travail
,
and
after
in
my
lying
in
,
be
such
,
that
if
she
have
be
my
own
mother
it
could
not
have
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
let
none
be
encourage
in
their
loose
practice
from
this
dexterous
lady
's
management
,
for
she
be
go
to
her
place
,
and
I
dare
say
have
leave
nothing
behind
her
that
can
or
will
come
up
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
be
bring
to
bed
about
twenty
-
two
day
when
I
receive
another
letter
from
my
friend
at
the
bank
,
with
the
surprising
news
that
he
have
obtain
a
final
sentence
of
divorce
against
his
wife
,
and
have
serve
her
with
it
on
such
a
day
,
and
that
he
have
such
an
answer
to
give
to
all
my
scruple
about
his
marrying
again
,
as
I
could
not
expect
,
and
as
he
have
no
desire
of
;
for
that
his
wife
,
who
have
be
under
some
remorse
before
for
her
usage
of
him
,
as
soon
as
she
have
the
account
that
he
have
gain
his
point
,
have
very
unhappily
destroy
herself
that
same
evening
.
  
<EOS>
He
express
himself
very
handsomely
as
to
his
be
concerned
at
her
disaster
,
but
clear
himself
of
have
any
hand
in
it
,
and
that
he
have
only
do
himself
justice
in
a
case
in
which
he
be
notoriously
injure
and
abuse
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
say
that
he
be
extremely
afflict
at
it
,
and
have
no
view
of
any
satisfaction
leave
in
his
world
,
but
only
in
the
hope
that
I
would
come
and
relieve
him
by
my
company
;
and
then
he
press
me
violently
indeed
to
give
him
some
hope
that
I
would
at
least
come
up
to
town
and
let
him
see
me
,
when
he
would
further
enter
into
discourse
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
surprised
at
the
news
,
and
begin
now
seriously
to
reflect
on
my
present
circumstance
,
and
the
inexpressible
misfortune
it
be
to
me
to
have
a
child
upon
my
hand
,
and
what
to
do
in
it
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
open
my
case
at
a
distance
to
my
governess
.
 
<EOS>
I
appear
melancholy
and
uneasy
for
several
day
,
and
she
lie
at
me
continually
to
know
what
trouble
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
for
my
life
tell
her
that
I
have
an
offer
of
marriage
,
after
I
have
so
often
tell
her
that
I
have
a
husband
,
so
that
I
really
know
not
what
to
say
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
I
have
something
which
very
much
trouble
me
,
but
at
the
same
time
tell
her
I
could
not
speak
of
it
to
any
one
alive
.
  
<EOS>
She
continue
importune
me
several
day
,
but
it
be
impossible
,
I
tell
her
,
for
me
to
commit
the
secret
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
this
,
instead
of
be
an
answer
to
her
,
increase
her
importunity
;
she
urge
her
have
be
trust
with
the
great
secret
of
this
nature
,
that
it
be
her
business
to
conceal
everything
,
and
that
to
discover
thing
of
that
nature
would
be
her
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
me
if
ever
I
have
find
her
tattle
to
me
of
other
people
's
affair
,
and
how
could
I
suspect
her
?
<EOS>
She
tell
me
,
to
unfold
myself
to
her
be
tell
it
to
nobody
;
that
she
be
silent
as
death
;
that
it
must
be
a
very
strange
case
indeed
that
she
could
not
help
me
out
of
;
but
to
conceal
it
be
to
deprive
myself
of
all
possible
help
,
or
mean
of
help
,
and
to
deprive
her
of
the
opportunity
of
serve
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
have
such
a
bewitching
eloquence
,
and
so
great
a
power
of
persuasion
that
there
be
no
conceal
anything
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
resolve
to
unbosom
myself
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
the
history
of
my
Lancashire
marriage
,
and
how
both
of
us
have
be
disappoint
;
how
we
come
together
,
and
how
we
part
;
how
he
absolutely
discharge
me
,
as
far
as
lie
in
him
,
free
liberty
to
marry
again
,
protest
that
if
he
know
it
he
would
never
claim
me
,
or
disturb
or
expose
me
;
that
I
think
I
be
free
,
but
be
dreadfully
afraid
to
venture
,
for
fear
of
the
consequence
that
may
follow
in
case
of
a
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
tell
her
what
a
good
offer
I
have
;
show
her
my
friend
's
two
last
letter
,
invite
me
to
come
to
London
,
and
let
her
see
with
what
affection
and
earnestness
they
be
write
,
but
blot
out
the
name
,
and
also
the
story
about
the
disaster
of
his
wife
,
only
that
she
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
She
fall
a
-
laughing
at
my
scruple
about
marry
,
and
tell
me
the
other
be
no
marriage
,
but
a
cheat
on
both
side
;
and
that
,
as
we
be
part
by
mutual
consent
,
the
nature
of
the
contract
be
destroy
,
and
the
obligation
be
mutually
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
argument
for
this
at
the
tip
of
her
tongue
;
and
,
in
short
,
reason
me
out
of
my
reason
;
not
but
that
it
be
too
by
the
help
of
my
own
inclination
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
come
the
great
and
main
difficulty
,
and
that
be
the
child
;
this
,
she
tell
me
in
so
many
word
,
must
be
remove
,
and
that
so
as
that
it
should
never
be
possible
for
any
one
to
discover
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
no
marrying
without
entirely
conceal
that
I
have
have
a
child
,
for
he
would
soon
have
discover
by
the
age
of
it
that
it
be
bear
,
nay
,
and
get
too
,
since
my
parley
with
him
,
and
that
would
have
destroy
all
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
touch
my
heart
so
forcibly
to
think
of
part
entirely
with
the
child
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
of
have
it
murder
,
or
starve
by
neglect
and
ill
-
usage
(
which
be
much
the
same
)
,
that
I
could
not
think
of
it
without
horror
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
all
those
woman
who
consent
to
the
dispose
their
child
out
of
the
way
,
as
it
be
call
,
for
decency
sake
,
would
consider
that
'
tis
only
a
contrived
method
for
murder
;
that
be
to
say
,
a
-
kill
their
child
with
safety
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
manifest
to
all
that
understand
anything
of
child
,
that
we
be
bear
into
the
world
helpless
,
and
incapable
either
to
supply
our
own
want
or
so
much
as
make
them
know
;
and
that
without
help
we
must
perish
;
and
this
help
require
not
only
an
assist
hand
,
whether
of
the
mother
or
somebody
else
,
but
there
be
two
thing
necessary
in
that
assist
 
hand
,
that
is
,
care
and
skill
;
without
both
which
,
half
the
child
that
be
bear
would
die
,
nay
,
though
they
be
not
to
be
deny
food
;
and
one
half
more
of
those
that
remain
would
be
cripple
or
fool
,
lose
their
limb
,
and
perhaps
their
sense
.
<EOS>
I
question
not
but
that
these
be
partly
the
reason
why
affection
be
place
by
nature
in
the
heart
of
mother
to
their
child
;
without
which
they
would
never
be
able
to
give
themselves
up
,
as
'
tis
necessary
<EOS>
they
should
,
to
the
care
and
waking
pain
needful
to
the
support
of
their
child
.
  
<EOS>
since
this
care
be
needful
to
the
life
of
child
,
to
neglect
them
be
to
murder
them
;
again
,
to
give
them
up
to
be
manage
by
those
people
who
have
none
of
that
needful
affection
place
by
nature
in
them
,
be
to
neglect
them
in
the
high
degree
;
nay
,
in
some
it
go
farther
,
and
be
a
neglect
in
order
to
their
be
lose
;
so
that
'
tis
even
an
intentional
murder
,
whether
the
child
live
or
die
.
  
<EOS>
all
those
thing
represent
themselves
to
my
view
,
and
that
be
the
black
and
most
frightful
form
:
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
be
very
free
with
my
governess
,
whom
I
have
now
learn
to
call
mother
,
I
represent
to
her
all
the
dark
thought
which
I
have
upon
me
about
it
,
and
tell
her
what
distress
I
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
graver
by
much
at
this
part
than
at
the
other
;
but
as
she
be
harden
in
these
thing
beyond
all
possibility
of
be
touch
with
the
religious
part
,
and
the
scruple
about
the
murder
,
so
she
be
equally
impenetrable
in
that
part
which
relate
to
affection
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
me
if
she
have
not
be
careful
and
tender
to
me
in
my
lying
in
,
as
if
I
have
be
her
own
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
own
she
have
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
when
you
be
go
,
what
be
you
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
would
it
be
to
me
if
you
be
to
be
hang
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
there
be
not
woman
who
,
as
it
be
their
trade
and
they
get
their
bread
by
it
,
value
themselves
upon
their
being
as
careful
of
child
as
their
own
mother
can
be
,
and
understand
it
rather
better
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
fear
it
not
;
how
be
we
nurse
ourselves
?
<EOS>
be
you
sure
you
be
nurse
up
by
your
own
mother
?
<EOS>
and
yet
you
look
fat
and
fair
,
child
,
"
say
the
old
beldam
;
and
with
that
she
stroke
me
over
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
be
concern
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
go
on
in
her
drolle
way
;
"
I
have
no
murderer
about
me
;
I
employ
the
good
and
the
honest
nurse
that
can
be
have
,
and
have
as
few
child
miscarry
under
their
hand
as
there
would
if
they
be
all
nurse
by
mother
;
we
want
neither
care
nor
skill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
touch
me
to
the
quick
when
she
ask
if
I
be
sure
that
I
be
nurse
by
my
own
mother
;
on
the
contrary
I
be
sure
I
be
not
;
and
I
tremble
,
and
look
pale
at
the
very
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
sure
,
"
say
I
to
myself
,
"
this
creature
can
not
be
a
witch
,
or
have
any
conversation
with
a
spirit
,
that
can
inform
her
what
be
do
with
me
before
I
be
able
to
know
it
myself
"
;
and
I
look
at
her
as
if
I
have
be
frighten
;
but
reflect
that
it
could
not
be
possible
for
her
to
know
anything
about
me
,
that
disorder
go
off
,
and
I
begin
to
be
easy
,
but
it
be
not
presently
.
  
<EOS>
She
perceive
the
disorder
I
be
in
,
but
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
it
;
so
she
run
on
in
her
wild
talk
upon
the
weakness
of
my
supposing
that
child
be
murder
because
they
be
not
all
nurse
by
the
mother
,
and
to
persuade
me
that
the
child
she
dispose
of
be
as
well
use
as
if
the
mother
have
the
nursing
of
them
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
true
,
mother
,
"
say
I
,
"
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
,
but
my
doubt
be
very
strongly
ground
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
then
,
"
say
she
,
"
let
's
hear
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
first
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
give
a
piece
of
money
to
these
people
to
take
the
child
off
the
parent
's
hand
,
and
to
take
care
of
it
as
long
as
it
live
.
 
<EOS>
now
we
know
,
mother
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
those
be
poor
people
,
and
their
gain
consist
in
be
quit
of
the
charge
as
soon
as
they
can
<EOS>
;
how
can
I
doubt
but
that
,
as
it
be
good
for
them
to
have
the
child
die
,
they
be
not
over
solicitous
about
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
all
vapour
and
fancy
,
"
say
the
old
woman
;
"
I
tell
you
their
credit
depend
upon
the
child
's
life
,
and
they
be
as
careful
as
any
mother
of
you
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
mother
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
I
be
but
sure
my
little
baby
would
be
carefully
look
to
,
and
have
justice
do
it
,
I
should
be
happy
indeed
;
but
it
be
impossible
I
can
be
satisfied
in
that
point
unless
I
see
it
,
and
to
see
it
would
be
ruin
and
destruction
to
me
,
as
now
my
case
stand
;
so
what
to
do
I
know
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
fine
story
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
governess
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
see
the
child
,
and
you
would
not
see
the
child
;
you
would
be
conceal
and
discover
both
together
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
thing
impossible
,
my
dear
;
so
you
must
e'en
do
as
other
conscientious
mother
have
do
before
you
,
and
be
content
with
thing
as
they
must
be
,
though
they
be
not
as
you
wish
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
understand
what
she
mean
by
conscientious
mother
;
she
would
have
say
conscientious
whore
,
but
she
be
not
willing
to
disoblige
me
,
for
really
in
this
case
I
be
not
a
whore
,
because
legally
married
,
the
force
of
former
marriage
except
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
let
me
be
what
I
would
,
I
be
not
come
up
to
that
pitch
of
hardness
common
to
the
profession
;
I
mean
,
to
be
unnatural
,
and
regardless
of
the
safety
of
my
child
;
and
I
preserve
this
honest
affection
so
long
,
that
I
be
upon
the
point
of
give
up
my
friend
at
the
bank
,
who
lie
so
hard
at
me
to
come
to
him
and
marry
him
,
that
,
in
short
,
there
be
hardly
any
room
to
deny
him
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
my
old
governess
come
to
me
,
with
her
usual
assurance
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
find
out
a
way
how
you
shall
be
at
a
certainty
that
your
child
shall
be
use
well
,
and
yet
the
people
that
take
care
of
it
shall
never
know
you
,
or
who
the
mother
of
the
child
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
mother
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
you
can
do
so
,
you
will
engage
me
to
you
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
she
,
"
be
you
willing
to
be
a
some
small
annual
expense
,
more
than
what
we
usually
give
to
the
people
we
contract
with
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
I
,
"
with
all
my
heart
,
provide
I
may
be
conceal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
,
"
say
the
governess
,
"
you
shall
be
secure
,
for
the
nurse
shall
never
so
much
as
dare
to
inquire
about
you
,
and
you
shall
once
or
twice
a
year
go
with
me
and
see
your
child
,
and
see
how
'
tis
use
,
and
be
satisfied
that
it
be
in
good
hand
,
nobody
know
who
you
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
you
think
,
mother
,
that
when
I
come
to
see
my
child
,
I
shall
be
able
to
conceal
my
be
the
mother
of
it
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
that
possible
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
my
governess
,
"
if
you
discover
it
,
the
nurse
shall
be
never
the
wise
;
for
she
shall
be
forbid
to
ask
any
question
about
you
,
or
to
take
any
notice
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
offer
it
,
she
shall
lose
the
money
which
you
be
suppose
to
give
her
,
and
the
child
shall
be
take
from
her
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
pleased
with
this
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
next
week
a
countrywoman
be
bring
from
Hertford
,
or
thereabout
,
who
be
to
take
the
child
off
our
hand
entirely
for
#
#
#
#
10
in
money
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
would
allow
#
#
#
#
5
a
year
more
of
her
,
she
would
be
oblige
to
bring
the
child
to
my
governess
's
house
as
often
as
we
desire
,
or
we
should
come
down
and
look
at
it
,
and
see
how
well
she
use
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
be
very
wholesome
-
look
,
a
likely
woman
,
a
cottager
's
wife
,
but
she
have
very
good
clothe
and
linen
,
and
everything
well
about
her
;
and
with
a
heavy
heart
and
many
a
tear
,
I
let
her
have
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
down
at
Hertford
,
and
look
at
her
and
at
her
dwelling
,
which
I
like
well
enough
;
and
I
promise
her
great
thing
if
she
would
be
kind
to
the
child
,
so
she
know
at
first
word
that
I
be
the
child
's
mother
.
<EOS>
but
she
seem
to
be
so
much
out
of
the
way
,
and
to
have
no
room
to
inquire
after
me
,
that
I
think
I
be
safe
enough
.
<EOS>
so
,
in
short
,
I
consent
to
let
her
have
the
child
,
and
I
give
her
#
#
#
#
10
;
that
be
to
say
,
I
give
it
to
my
governess
,
who
give
it
the
poor
woman
before
my
face
,
she
agree
never
to
return
the
child
back
to
me
,
or
to
claim
anything
more
for
its
keeping
or
bring
up
;
only
that
I
promise
,
if
she
take
a
great
deal
of
care
of
it
,
I
would
give
her
something
more
as
often
as
I
come
to
see
it
;
so
that
I
be
not
bind
to
pay
the
#
#
#
#
5
,
only
that
I
promise
my
governess
<EOS>
I
would
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
my
great
care
be
over
,
after
a
manner
,
which
though
it
do
not
at
all
satisfy
my
mind
,
yet
be
the
most
convenient
for
me
,
as
my
affair
then
stand
,
of
any
that
could
be
think
of
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
begin
to
write
to
my
friend
at
the
bank
in
a
more
kindly
style
,
and
<EOS>
particularly
about
the
beginning
of
July
I
send
him
a
letter
,
that
I
propose
to
be
in
town
some
time
in
August
.
 
<EOS>
He
return
me
an
answer
in
the
most
passionate
term
imaginable
,
and
desire
me
to
let
him
have
timely
notice
,
and
he
would
come
and
meet
me
,
two
day
's
journey
.
 
<EOS>
this
puzzle
me
scurvily
,
and
I
do
not
know
what
answer
to
make
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
once
I
resolve
to
take
the
stage
-
coach
to
West
Chester
,
on
purpose
only
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
come
back
,
that
he
may
see
me
really
come
in
the
same
coach
;
for
I
have
a
jealous
thought
,
though
I
have
no
ground
for
it
at
all
,
lest
he
should
think
I
be
not
really
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
no
ill
-
ground
thought
as
you
shall
hear
presently
.
  
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
reason
myself
out
of
it
,
but
it
be
in
vain
;
the
impression
lie
so
strong
on
my
mind
,
that
it
be
not
to
be
resist
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
it
come
as
an
addition
to
my
new
design
of
go
into
the
country
,
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
blind
to
my
old
governess
,
and
would
cover
entirely
all
my
other
affair
,
for
she
do
not
know
in
the
least
whether
my
new
lover
live
in
London
or
in
Lancashire
;
and
when
I
tell
her
my
resolution
,
she
be
fully
persuade
it
be
in
Lancashire
.
  
<EOS>
have
take
my
measure
for
this
journey
I
let
her
know
it
,
and
send
the
maid
that
tend
me
,
from
the
beginning
,
to
take
a
place
for
me
in
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
have
me
let
the
maid
have
wait
on
me
down
to
the
last
stage
,
and
come
up
again
in
the
waggon
,
but
I
convince
her
it
would
not
be
convenient
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
away
,
she
tell
me
she
would
enter
into
no
measure
for
correspondence
,
for
she
see
evidently
that
my
affection
to
my
child
would
cause
me
to
write
to
her
,
and
to
visit
her
too
when
I
come
to
town
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
her
it
would
,
and
so
take
my
leave
,
<EOS>
well
satisfied
to
have
be
free
from
such
a
house
,
however
good
my
accommodation
there
have
be
,
as
I
have
relate
above
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
the
place
in
the
coach
not
to
its
full
extent
,
but
to
a
place
call
Stone
,
in
Cheshire
,
I
think
it
be
,
where
I
not
only
have
no
manner
of
business
,
but
not
so
much
as
the
least
acquaintance
with
any
person
in
the
town
or
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
that
with
money
in
the
pocket
one
be
at
home
anywhere
;
so
I
lodge
there
two
or
three
day
,
till
,
<EOS>
watch
my
opportunity
,
I
find
room
in
another
stage
-
coach
,
and
take
passage
back
again
for
London
,
send
a
letter
to
my
gentleman
that
I
should
be
such
a
certain
day
at
Stony
-
Stratford
,
where
the
coachman
tell
me
he
be
to
lodge
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
to
be
a
chance
coach
that
I
have
take
up
,
which
,
have
be
hire
on
purpose
to
carry
some
gentleman
to
West
Chester
who
be
go
for
Ireland
,
be
now
return
,
and
do
not
tie
itself
to
exact
time
or
place
as
the
stage
do
;
so
that
,
have
be
oblige
to
lie
still
on
Sunday
,
he
have
time
to
get
himself
ready
to
come
out
,
which
otherwise
he
could
not
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
his
warning
be
so
short
,
that
he
could
not
reach
to
Stony
-
Stratford
time
enough
to
be
with
me
at
night
,
but
he
meet
me
at
a
place
call
Brickhill
the
next
morning
,
as
we
be
just
come
in
to
tow
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
very
glad
to
see
him
,
for
I
have
think
myself
a
little
disappointed
over
-
night
,
see
I
have
go
so
far
to
contrive
my
come
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
please
me
doubly
too
by
the
figure
he
come
in
,
for
he
bring
a
very
handsome
(
gentleman
's
)
coach
and
four
horse
,
with
a
servant
to
attend
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
me
out
of
the
stage
-
coach
immediately
,
which
stop
at
an
inn
in
Brickhill
;
and
put
into
the
same
inn
,
he
set
up
his
own
coach
,
and
bespoke
his
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
what
he
mean
by
that
,
for
I
be
for
go
forward
with
the
journey
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
no
,
I
have
need
of
a
little
rest
upon
the
road
,
and
that
be
a
very
good
sort
of
a
house
,
though
it
be
but
a
little
town
;
<EOS>
so
we
would
go
no
farther
that
night
,
<EOS>
whatever
come
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
press
him
much
,
for
since
he
have
come
so
to
meet
me
,
and
put
himself
to
so
much
expense
,
it
be
but
<EOS>
reasonable
I
should
oblige
him
a
little
too
;
<EOS>
so
I
be
easy
as
to
that
point
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
we
walk
to
see
the
town
,
to
see
the
church
,
and
to
view
the
field
,
and
the
country
,
as
be
usual
for
stranger
to
do
;
and
our
landlord
be
our
guide
in
go
to
see
the
church
.
<EOS>
I
observe
my
gentleman
inquire
pretty
much
about
the
parson
,
and
I
take
the
hint
immediately
that
he
certainly
would
propose
to
be
marry
;
and
though
it
be
a
sudden
thought
,
it
follow
presently
,
that
,
in
short
,
I
would
not
refuse
him
;
for
,
to
be
plain
,
with
my
circumstance
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
condition
now
<EOS>
to
say
no
<EOS>
;
I
have
no
reason
now
to
run
any
more
such
hazard
.
  
<EOS>
but
while
these
thought
run
round
in
my
head
,
which
be
the
work
but
of
a
few
moment
,
I
observe
my
landlord
take
him
aside
and
whisper
to
him
,
though
not
very
softly
neither
,
for
so
much
I
overhear
:
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
if
you
shall
have
occasion
"
the
rest
I
could
not
hear
,
but
it
seem
it
be
to
this
purpose
:
 
"
Sir
,
if
you
shall
have
occasion
for
a
minister
,
I
have
a
friend
a
little
way
off
that
will
serve
you
,
and
be
as
private
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
My
gentleman
answer
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
,
"
very
well
,
I
believe
I
shall
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
no
sooner
come
back
to
the
inn
<EOS>
but
he
fall
upon
me
with
irresistible
word
,
that
since
he
have
have
the
good
fortune
to
meet
me
,
and
everything
concur
,
it
would
be
hasten
his
felicity
if
I
would
put
an
end
to
the
matter
just
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
say
I
,
colour
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
in
an
inn
,
and
upon
the
road
!
 
<EOS>
bless
us
all
,
"
say
I
,
as
if
I
have
be
surprise
,
"
how
can
you
talk
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
can
talk
so
very
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
come
a
-
purpose
to
talk
so
,
and
I
will
show
you
that
I
do
"
;
and
with
that
he
pull
out
a
great
bundle
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
fright
me
,
"
say
I
;
"
what
be
all
these
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
fright
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
and
kiss
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
that
he
have
be
so
free
to
call
me
"
my
dear
"
;
then
he
repeat
it
,
"
do
not
be
fright
;
you
shall
see
what
it
be
all
"
;
then
he
lay
them
all
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
first
the
deed
or
sentence
of
divorce
from
his
wife
,
and
the
full
evidence
of
her
play
the
whore
;
then
there
be
the
certificate
of
the
minister
and
churchwarden
of
the
parish
where
she
live
,
prove
that
she
be
bury
,
and
intimate
the
manner
of
her
death
;
the
copy
of
the
coroner
's
warrant
for
a
jury
to
sit
upon
her
,
and
the
verdict
of
the
jury
,
who
bring
it
in
Non
compos
mentis
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
indeed
to
the
purpose
,
and
to
give
me
satisfaction
,
though
,
by
the
way
,
I
be
not
so
scrupulous
,
<EOS>
have
he
know
all
,
but
that
I
may
have
take
him
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
look
them
all
over
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
tell
him
that
this
be
all
very
clear
indeed
,
but
that
he
nee
not
have
give
himself
the
trouble
to
have
bring
them
out
with
him
,
for
it
be
time
enough
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
he
say
,
it
may
be
time
enough
for
me
,
but
no
time
<EOS>
but
the
present
time
be
time
enough
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
other
paper
roll
up
,
and
I
ask
him
what
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
ay
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
question
I
want
to
have
you
ask
me
"
;
so
he
unroll
them
and
take
out
a
little
shagreen
case
,
and
give
me
out
of
it
a
very
fine
diamond
ring
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
refuse
it
,
if
I
have
a
mind
to
do
so
,
for
he
put
it
upon
my
finger
;
so
I
make
him
a
curtsy
and
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
take
out
another
ring
:
 
"
<EOS>
and
this
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
for
another
occasion
,
"
<EOS>
so
he
put
that
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
let
me
see
it
,
though
,
"
say
I
,
and
smile
;
"
I
guess
what
it
be
;
I
think
you
be
mad
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
be
mad
if
I
have
do
less
,
"
say
he
,
and
still
he
do
not
show
me
,
and
I
have
a
great
mind
to
see
it
<EOS>
;
so
I
say
,
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
let
me
see
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
hold
,
"
say
he
,
"
first
look
here
"
;
then
he
take
up
the
roll
again
and
read
it
,
and
behold
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
licence
for
us
to
be
marry
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
you
distract
?
<EOS>
why
,
you
be
fully
satisfied
that
I
would
comply
and
yield
at
first
word
,
or
resolve
to
take
no
denial
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
last
be
certainly
the
case
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
may
be
mistake
,
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
can
you
think
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
be
deny
,
I
can
not
be
deny
"
;
and
with
that
he
fall
to
kiss
me
so
violently
,
I
could
not
get
rid
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
bed
in
the
room
,
and
we
be
walk
to
and
again
,
eager
in
the
discourse
;
at
last
he
take
me
by
surprise
in
his
arm
,
and
throw
me
on
the
bed
and
himself
with
me
,
and
hold
me
fast
in
his
arm
,
but
without
the
least
offer
of
any
indecency
,
court
me
to
consent
with
such
repeat
entreaty
and
argument
,
protest
his
affection
,
and
vow
he
would
not
let
me
go
till
I
have
promise
him
,
that
at
last
I
say
,
"
why
,
you
resolve
not
to
be
deny
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
be
deny
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
I
,
and
give
him
a
slight
kiss
,
"
then
you
shall
not
be
deny
,
"
say
I
;
"
let
me
get
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
transported
with
my
consent
,
and
the
kind
manner
of
it
<EOS>
,
that
I
begin
to
think
once
he
take
it
for
a
marriage
,
and
would
not
stay
for
the
form
;
but
I
wrong
him
,
for
he
give
over
kiss
me
,
and
then
give
me
two
or
three
kiss
again
,
thank
me
for
my
kind
yield
to
him
;
and
be
so
overcome
with
the
satisfaction
and
joy
of
it
,
that
I
see
tear
stand
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
from
him
,
for
it
fill
my
eye
with
tear
too
,
and
I
ask
him
leave
to
retire
a
little
to
my
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
if
ever
I
have
a
grain
of
true
repentance
for
a
vicious
and
abominable
life
for
twenty
-
four
year
past
,
it
be
then
.
 
<EOS>
on
,
what
a
felicity
be
it
to
mankind
,
say
I
to
myself
,
that
they
can
not
see
into
the
heart
of
one
another
!
 
<EOS>
how
happy
have
it
be
for
me
if
I
have
be
wife
to
a
man
of
so
much
honesty
,
and
so
much
affection
from
the
beginning
!
  
<EOS>
then
it
occur
to
me
,
"
what
an
abominable
creature
be
I
!
<EOS>
and
how
be
this
innocent
gentleman
go
to
be
abuse
by
me
!
<EOS>
how
little
do
he
think
,
that
have
divorce
a
whore
,
he
be
throw
himself
into
the
arm
of
another
!
<EOS>
that
he
be
go
to
marry
one
that
have
lie
with
two
brother
,
and
have
have
three
child
by
her
own

<EOS>
one
that
be
bear
in
Newgate
,
whose
mother
be
a
whore
,
and
be
now
a
transport
thief
!
<EOS>
one
that
have
lie
with
thirteen
man
,
and
have
have
a
child
since
he

me
!
 
<EOS>
poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
what
be
he
go
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
after
this
reproaching
myself
be
over
,
it
follow
thus
:
"
<EOS>
well
,
if
I
must
be
his
wife
,
if
it
please
God
to
give
me
grace
,
I
will
be
a
true
wife
to
him
,
and
love
him
suitably
to
the
strange
excess
of
his
passion
for
me
;
I
will
make
him
amend
if
possible
,
 
by
what
he
shall
see
,
for
the
cheat
and
abuse
I
put
upon
him
,
which
he
do
not
see
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
impatient
for
my
come
out
of
my
chamber
,
but
find
me
long
,
he
go
downstairs
and
talk
with
my
landlord
about
the
parson
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlord
,
an
officious
though
well
-
mean
fellow
,
have
send
away
for
the
neighbour
clergyman
;
and
when
my

,
and

of

,
"
Sir

say
he
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
my
friend
be
in
the
house
"
;
so
without
any
more
word
he
bring
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
the
minister
,
he
ask
him
if
he
would
venture
to
marry
a
couple
of
stranger
that
be
both
willing
.
 
<EOS>
the
parson
say
that
Mr.
#
#
#
#
 
have
say
something
to
him
of
it
;
that
he
hope
it
be
no
clandestine
business
;
that
he
seem
to
be
a
grave
gentleman
,
and
he
suppose
madam
be
not
a
girl
,
so
that
the
consent
of
friend
should
be
want
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
put
you
out
of
doubt
of
that
,
"
say
my
gentleman
,
"
read
this
paper
"
;
and
out
he
pull
the
license
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
satisfied
,
"
say
the
minister
;
"
where

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You

"
say
my

<EOS>
when
he
have
say
thus

upstairs
,
and
I
be
by
that

but
he

you

;
so
he
ask
if
I
would
let
him
come
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
tis
time
enough
,
"
say
I
,
"
in
the
morning
,
be
it
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
my
dear
,
he
seem
to
scruple
whether
it
be
not
some
young
girl
steal
from
her
parent
,
and
I
assure
him
we
be
both
of
age
to
command
our
own
consent
;
and
that
make
him
ask
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
as
you
please
"
;
so
up
they
bring
the
parson
,
and
a
merry
,
good
sort
of
gentleman
<EOS>
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
tell
,
it
seem
,
that
we
have
meet
there
by
accident
,
that
I
come
in
the
Chester
coach
,
and
my
gentleman
in
his
own
coach
to
meet
me
;
that
we
be
to
have
meet
last
night
at
Stony
-
Stratford
,
but
that
he
could
not
reach
so
far
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
"
say
the
parson
,
"
every
ill
turn
have
some
good
in
it

<EOS>
the
disappointment
,
sir
,
"
say
he
to
my
gentleman
,
"
be
yours
,
and
the
good
turn
be
mine
,
for
if
you
have
meet
at
Stony
-
Stratford
<EOS>
I
have
not
have
the
honour
to
marry
you
.
 
<EOS>
Landlord
,
have
you
a
Common
Prayer
Book
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
start
as
if
I
have
be
frighten
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
what
,
to
marry
in
an
inn
,
and
at
night
too
?
"
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
the
minister
,
"
if
you
will
have
it
be
in
the
church
,
you
shall
;
but
I
assure
you
your
marriage
will
be
as
firm
here
as
in
the
church
;
we
be
not
tie
by
the
canon
to
marry
nowhere
but
in
the
church
;
and
if
you
will
have
it
in
the
church
,
it
will
be
a
public
as
a
county
fair
;
and
as
for
the
time
of
day
,
it
do
not
at
all
weigh
in
this
case
;
our
prince
be
marry
in
their
chamber
,
and
at
eight
or
ten
o'clock
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
great
while
before
I
could
be
persuade
,
and
pretend
not
to
be
willing
at
all
to
be
marry
but
in
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
grimace
;
so
<EOS>
I
seem
at
last
to
be
prevail
on
,
and
my
landlord
and
his
wife
and
daughter
be
call
up
.
 
<EOS>
My
landlord
be
father
and
clerk
and
all
together
,
and
we
be
married
,
and
very
merry
we
be
;
though
I
confess
the
self
-
reproach
which
I
have
upon
me
before
lie
close
to
me
,
and
extort
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
deep
sigh
from
me
,
which
my
bridegroom
take
notice
of
,
and
endeavour
to
encourage
me
,
thinking
,
poor
man
<EOS>
,
that
I
have
some
little
hesitation
at
the
step
I
have
take
so
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
We
enjoy
ourselves
that
evening
completely
,
and
yet
all
be
keep
so
private
in
the
inn
that
not
a
servant
in
the
house
know
of
it
,
for
my
landlady
and
her
daughter
wait
on
me
,
and
would
not
let
any
of
the
maid
come
upstairs
,
except
while
we
be
at
supper
.
 
<EOS>
My
landlady
's
daughter
I
call
my
bridesmaid
;
and
send
for
a
shopkeeper
the
next
morning
<EOS>
,
I
give
the
young
woman
a
good
suit
of
knot
,
as
good
as
the
town
would
afford
,
and
find
it
be
a
lace
-
make
town
<EOS>
,
I
give
her
mother
a
piece
of
bone
-
lace
for
a
head
.
  
<EOS>
one
reason
that
my
landlord
be
so
close
be
,
that
he
be
unwille
the
minister
of
the
parish
should
hear
of
it
;
but
for
all
that
somebody
hear
of
it
,
so
at
that
we
have
the
bell
set
a
-
ring
<EOS>
the
next
morning
early
,
and
the
music
,
such
as
the
town
would
afford
,
under
our
window
;
but
my
landlord
brazen
it
out
,
that
we
be
marry
before
we
come
thither
,
only
that
,
be
his
former
guest
,
we
would
have
our
wedding
-
supper
at
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
We
could
not
find
in
our
heart
to
stir
the
next
day
;
for
,
in
short
,
have
be
disturb
by
the
bell
in
the
morning
,
and
have
perhaps
not
sleep
overmuch
before
,
we
be
so
sleepy
afterwards
that
we
lay
in
bed
till
almost
twelve
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
my
landlady
that
we
may
not
have
any
more
music
in
the
town
,
nor
ringing
of
bell
,
and
she
manage
it
so
well
that
we
be
very
quiet
;
but
an
odd
passage
interrupt
all
my
mirth
for
a
good
while
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
room
of
the
house
look
into
the
street
,
and
my
new
spouse
be
belowstair
<EOS>
,
I
have
walk
to
the
end
of
the
room
;
and
it
be
a
pleasant
,
warm
day
,
I
have
open
the
window
,
and
be
stand
at
it
for
some
air
,
when
I
see
three
gentleman
come
by
on
horseback
and
go
into
an
inn
just
against
us
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
conceal
,
nor
be
it
so
doubtful
as
to
leave
me
any
room
to
question
it
,
but
the
second
of
the
three
be
my
Lancashire
husband
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
frightened
to
death
;
I
never
be
in
such
a
consternation
in
my
life
;
I
though
I
should
have
sink
into
the
ground
;
my
blood
run
chill
in
my
vein
,
and
I
tremble
as
if
I
have
be
in
a
cold
fit
of
ague
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
there
be
no
room
to
question
the
truth
of
it
;
I
know
his
clothe
,
I
know
his
horse
,
and
I
know
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
sensible
reflect
I
make
be
,
that
my
husband
be
not
by
to
see
my
disorder
,
and
that
I
be
very
glad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
not
be
long
in
the
house
<EOS>
but
they
come
to
the
window
of
their
room
,
as
be
usual
;
but
my
window
be
shut
,
you
may
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
could
not
keep
from
peep
at
them
,
and
there
I
see
him
again
,
hear
him
call
out
to
one
of
the
servant
of
the
house
for
something
he
want
,
and
receive
all
the
terrifying
confirmation
of
its
be
the
same
person
that
be
possible
to
be
have
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
concern
be
to
know
,
if
possible
,
what
be
his
business
there
;
but
that
be
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
my
imagination
form
an
idea
of
one
frightful
thing
,
sometimes
of
another
;
sometime
I
think
he
have
discover
me
,
and
be
come
to
upbraid
me
with
ingratitude
and
breach
of
honour
;
and
every
moment
I
fancy
he
be
come
up
the
stair
to
insult
me
;
and
innumerable
fancy
come
into
my
head
of
what
be
never
in
his
head
,
nor
ever
could
be
,
unless
the
devil
have
reveal
it
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
remain
in
this
fright
nearly
two
hour
,
and
scarce
ever
keep
my
eye
from
the
window
or
door
of
the
inn
where
they
be
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
hear
a
great
clatter
in
the
passage
of
their
inn
,
I
run
to
the
window
,
and
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
,
see
them
all
three
go
out
again
and
travel
on
westward
.
 
<EOS>
have
they
go
towards
London
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
be
still
in
a
fright
,
lest
I
should
meet
him
on
the
road
again
,
and
that
he
should
know
me
;
but
he
go
the
contrary
way
,
and
so
I
be
ease
of
that
disorder
.
  
<EOS>
We
resolve
to
be
go
the
next
day
,
but
about
six
o'clock
at
night
<EOS>
we
be
alarm
with
a
great
uproar
in
the
street
,
and
people
ride
as
if
they
have
be
out
of
their
wit
;
and
what
be
it
<EOS>
but
a
hue
-
and
-
cry
after
three
highwayman
that
have
rob
two
coach
and
some
other
traveller
near
Dunstable
Hill
,
and
notice
have
,
it
seem
,
be
give
that
they
have
be
see
at
Brickhill
at
such
a
house
,
mean
the
house
where
those
gentleman
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
be
immediately
beset
and
search
,
but
there
be
witness
enough
that
the
gentleman
have
be
go
over
three
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
crowd
have
gather
about
,
we
have
the
news
presently
;
and
I
be
heartily
concerned
now
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
presently
tell
the
people
of
the
house
,
that
I
durst
to
say
those
be
not
the
person
,
for
that
I
know
one
of
the
gentleman
to
be
a
very
honest
person
,
and
of
a
good
estate
in
Lancashire
.
  
<EOS>
the
constable
who
come
with
the
hue
-
and
-
cry
be
immediately
inform
of
this
,
and
come
over
to
me
to
be
satisfied
from
my
own
mouth
,
and
I
assure
him
that
I
see
the
three
gentleman
as
I
be
at
the
window
;
that
I
see
them
afterwards
at
the
window
of
the
room
they
dine
in
;
that
I
see
them
afterwards
take
horse
,
and
I
could
assure
him
I
know
one
of
them
to
be
such
a
man
,
that
he
be
a
gentleman
of
a
very
good
estate
,
and
an
undoubted
character
in
Lancashire
,
<EOS>
from
whence
I
be
just
now
upon
my
journey
.
  
<EOS>
the
assurance
with
which
I
deliver
this
give
the
mob
gentry
a
check
,
and
give
the
constable
such
satisfaction
,
that
he
immediately
sound
a
retreat
,
tell
his
people
these
be
not
the
man
,
but
that
he
have
an
account
they
be
very
honest
gentleman
;
and
so
they
go
all
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
I
know
not
,
but
certain
it
be
that
the
coach
be
rob
at
Dunstable
Hill
,
and
#
#
#
#
560
in
money
take
;
besides
,
some
of
the
lace
merchant
that
always
travel
that
way
have
be
visit
too
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
three
gentleman
,
that
remain
to
be
explain
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
this
alarm
stop
us
another
day
,
though
my
spouse
be
for
travel
,
and
tell
me
that
it
be
always
safe
travel
after
a
robbery
,
for
that
the
thief
be
sure
to
be
go
far
enough
off
when
they
have
alarm
the
country
;
but
I
be
afraid
and
uneasy
,
and
indeed
principally
lest
my
old
acquaintance
should
be
upon
the
road
still
,
and
should
chance
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
live
four
pleasanter
day
together
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
mere
bride
all
this
while
,
and
my
new
spouse
strove
to
make
me
entirely
easy
in
everything
.
 
<EOS>
oh
could
this
state
of
life
have
continue
,
how
have
all
my
past
trouble
be
forget
,
and
my
future
sorrow
avoid
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
past
life
of
a
most
wretched
kind
to
account
for
,
some
if
it
in
this
world
as
well
as
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
away
the
fifth
day
;
and
my
landlord
,
because
he
see
me
uneasy
,
mount
himself
,
his
son
,
and
three
honest
country
fellow
with
good
firearm
,
and
,
without
tell
us
of
it
,
follow
the
coach
,
and
would
see
us
safe
into
Dunstable
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
do
no
less
than
treat
them
very
handsomely
at
Dunstable
,
which
cost
my
spouse
about
ten
or
twelve
shilling
,
and
something
he
give
the
man
for
their
time
too
,
but
my
landlord
would
take
nothing
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
most
happy
contrivance
for
me
that
could
have
fall
out
;
for
have
I
come
to
London
unmarrie
,
I
must
either
have
come
to
him
for
the
first
night
's
entertainment
,
or
have
discover
to
him
that
I
have
not
one
acquaintance
in
the
whole
city
of
London
that
could
receive
a
poor
bride
for
the
first
night
's
lodging
with
her
spouse
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
be
an
old
married
woman
,
I
make
no
scruple
of
go
directly
home
with
him
,
and
there
I
take
possession
at
once
of
a
house
well
furnished
,
and
a
husband
in
very
good
circumstance
,
so
that
I
have
a
prospect
of
a
very
happy
life
,
if
I
know
how
to
manage
it
;
and
I
have
leisure
to
consider
of
the
real
value
of
the
life
<EOS>
I
be
likely
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
how
different
it
be
to
be
from
the
loose
ungoverned
part
I
have
act
before
,
and
how
much
happy
a
life
of
virtue
and
sobriety
be
,
than
that
<EOS>
which
we
call
a
life
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
oh
have
this
particular
scene
of
life
last
,
or
have
I
learn
from
that
time
I
enjoy
it
,
to
have
taste
the
true
sweetness
of
it
,
and
have
I
not
fall
into
that
poverty
which
be
the
sure
bane
of
virtue
,
<EOS>
how
happy
have
I
be
,
not
only
here
,
but
perhaps
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
for
while
I
live
thus
,
I
be
really
a
penitent
for
all
my
life
past
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
back
on
it
with
abhorrence
,
and
may
truly
be
say
to
hate
myself
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
reflect
how
my
lover
at
the
Bath
,
strike
at
the
hand
of
God
,
repent
and
abandon
me
,
and
refuse
to
see
me
any
more
,
though
he
love
me
to
an
extreme
;
but
I
,
prompt
by
that
bad
of
devil
,
poverty
,
return
to
the
vile
practice
,
and
make
the
advantage
of
what
they
call
a
handsome
face
to
be
the
relief
to
my
necessity
,
and
beauty
be
a
pimp
to
vice
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
seem
land
in
a
safe
harbour
,
after
the
stormy
voyage
of
life
past
be
at
an
end
,
and
I
begin
to
be
thankful
for
my
deliverance
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
many
an
hour
by
myself
,
and
weep
over
the
remembrance
of
past
folly
,
and
the
dreadful
extravagance
of
a
wicked
life
,
and
sometimes
I
flatter
myself
that
I
have
sincerely
repent
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
temptation
which
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
human
nature
to
resist
,
and
few
know
what
would
be
their
case
if
drive
to
the
same
exigency
.
 
<EOS>
as
covetousness
be
the
root
of
all
evil
,
so
poverty
be
,
I
believe
,
the
bad
of
all
snare
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
waive
that
discourse
till
I
come
to
an
experiment
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
with
this
husband
with
the
utmost
tranquillity
;
he
be
a
quiet
,
sensible
,
sober
man
;
virtuous
,
modest
,
sincere
,
and
in
his
business
diligent
and
just
.
 
<EOS>
His
business
be
in
a
narrow
compass
,
and
his
income
sufficient
to
a
plentiful
way
of
live
in
the
ordinary
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
to
keep
an
equipage
,
and
make
a
figure
,
as
the
world
call
it
,
nor
do
I
expect
it
,
or
desire
it
;
for
as
I
abhor
the
levity
and
extravagance
of
my
former
life
,
so
I
choose
now
to
live
retired
,
frugal
,
and
within
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
keep
no
company
,
make
no
visit
;
mind
my
family
,
and
oblige
my
husband
;
and
this
kind
of
life
become
a
pleasure
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
live
in
an
uninterrupted
course
of
ease
and
content
for
five
year
,
when
a
sudden
blow
from
an
almost
invisible
hand
blast
all
my
happiness
,
and
turn
me
out
into
the
world
in
a
condition
the
reverse
of
all
that
have
be
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
husband
have
trust
one
of
his
fellow
-
clerk
with
a
sum
of
money
,
too
much
for
our
fortune
to
bear
the
loss
of
,
the
clerk
fail
,
and
the
loss
fall
very
heavy
on
my
husband
,
yet
it
be
not
so
great
<EOS>
neither
but
<EOS>
that
,
if
he
have
have
spirit
and
courage
to
have
look
his
misfortune
in
the
face
,
his
credit
be
so
good
that
,
as
I
tell
him
,
he
would
easily
recover
it
;
for
to
sink
under
trouble
be
to
double
the
weight
,
and
he
that
will
die
in
it
,
shall
die
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
speak
comfortably
to
him
;
the
wound
have
sink
too
deep
;
it
be
a
stab
that
touch
the
vital
;
he
grow
melancholy
and
disconsolate
,
and
from
thence
lethargic
,
and
die
.
 
<EOS>
I
foresaw
the
blow
,
and
be
extremely
oppress
in
my
mind
,
for
I
see
evidently
that
if
he
die
I
be
undone
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
two
child
by
him
and
no
more
,
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
it
begin
to
be
time
for
me
to
leave
bearing
child
,
for
I
be
now
eight
-
and
-
forty
,
and
I
suppose
if
he
have
live
I
should
have
have
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
leave
in
a
dismal
and
disconsolate
case
indeed
,
and
in
several
thing
bad
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
it
be
past
the
flourish
time
with
me
when
I
may
expect
to
be
court
for
a
mistress
;
that
agreeable
part
have
decline
some
time
,
and
the
ruin
only
appear
of
what
have
be
;
and
that
which
be
bad
than
all
this
,
that
I
be
the
most
dejected
,
disconsolate
creature
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
that
have
encourage
my
husband
,
and
endeavour
to
support
his
spirit
under
his
trouble
,
could
not
support
my
own
;
I
want
that
spirit
in
trouble
which
I
tell
him
be
so
necessary
to
him
for
bear
the
burthen
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
case
be
indeed
deplorable
,
for
I
be
leave
perfectly
friendless
and
helpless
,
and
the
loss
my
husband
have
sustain
have
reduce
his
circumstance
so
low
,
that
though
indeed
I
be
not
in
debt
,
yet
I
could
easily
foresee
that
what
be
leave
would
not
support
me
long
;
that
while
it
waste
daily
for
subsistence
,
I
have
not
way
to
increase
it
one
shilling
,
so
that
it
would
be
soon
all
spend
,
and
then
I
see
nothing
before
me
but
<EOS>
the
utmost
distress
;
and
this
represent
itself
so
lively
to
my
thought
,
that
it
seem
as
if
it
be
come
,
before
it
be
really
very
near
;
also
my
very
apprehension
double
the
misery
,
for
I
fancy
every
sixpence
that
I
pay
for
a
loaf
of
bread
<EOS>
be
the
last
that
I
have
in
the
world
,
and
that
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
be
to
fast
,
and
be
starve
to
death
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
distress
I
have
no
assistant
,
no
friend
to
comfort
or
advise
me
;
I
sit
and
cry
and
torment
myself
night
and
day
,
wring
my
hand
,
and
sometimes
rave
like
a
distracted
woman
;
and
indeed
I
have
often
wonder
it
have
not
affect
my
reason
,
for
I
have
the
vapour
to
such
a
degree
,
that
my
understanding
be
sometimes
quite
lose
in
fancy
and
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
two
year
in
this
dismal
condition
,
waste
that
little
I
have
,
weep
continually
over
my
dismal
circumstance
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
only
bleed
to
death
,
without
the
least
hope
or
prospect
of
help
from
God
or
man
;
and
now
I
have
cry
too
long
,
and
so
often
,
that
tear
be
,
as
I
may
say
,
exhaust
,
and
I
begin
to
be
desperate
,
for
I
grow
poor
apace
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
little
relief
I
have
put
off
my
house
and
take
lodging
;
and
as
I
be
reduce
my
living
,
so
I
sell
off
most
of
my
good
,
which
put
a
little
money
in
my
pocket
,
and
I
live
near
a
year
upon
that
,
spend
very
sparingly
,
and
eke
thing
out
to
the
utmost
;
but
still
when
I
look
before
me
,
my
very
heart
would
sink
within
me
at
the
inevitable
approach
of
misery
and
want
.
<EOS>
oh
let
none
read
this
part
without
seriously
reflect
on
the
circumstance
of
a
desolate
state
,
and
how
they
would
grapple
with
mere
want
of
friend
and
want
of
bread
;
it
will
certainly
make
them
think
not
of
spare
what
they
have
only
,
but
of
look
up
to
heaven
for
support
,
and
of
the
wise
man
's
prayer
,
"
give
me
not
poverty
,
lest
I
steal
.
"
  
<EOS>
let
them
remember
that
a
time
of
distress
be
a
time
of
dreadful
temptation
,
and
all
the
strength
to
resist
be
take
away
;
 
poverty
press
,
the
soul
be
make
desperate
by
distress
,
and
what
can
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
evening
,
<EOS>
when
be
bring
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
the
last
gasp
,
I
think
I
may
truly
say
I
be
distract
and
rave
,
when
prompt
by
I
know
not
what
spirit
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
do
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
or
why
,
I
dress
me
(
for
I
have
still
pretty
good
clothe
)
and
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sure
I
have
no
manner
of
design
in
my
head
when
I
go
out
;
I
neither
know
nor
consider
where
to
go
,
or
on
what
business
;
but
as
the
devil
carry
me
out
and
lay
his
bait
for
me
,
so
he
bring
me
,
to
be
sure
,
to
the
place
,
for
I
know
not
whither
<EOS>
I
be
go
or
what
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
wander
thus
about
,
I
know
not
whither
,
I
pass
by
an
apothecary
's
shop
in
Leadenhall
Street
,
when
I
see
lie
on
a
stool
just
before
the
counter
a
little
bundle
wrap
in
a
white
cloth
;
beyond
it
stand
a
maid
-
servant
with
her
back
to
it
,
look
towards
the
top
of
the
shop
,
where
the
apothecary
's
apprentice
,
as
I
suppose
,
be
stand
upon
the
counter
,
with
his
back
also
to
the
door
,
and
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
look
and
reach
up
to
the
upper
shelf
for
something
he
want
,
so
that
both
be
engage
mighty
earnestly
,
and
nobody
else
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
bait
;
and
the
devil
,
who
I
say
lay
the
snare
,
as
readily
prompt
me
as
if
he
have
speak
,
for
I
remember
,
and
shall
never
forget
it
,
'
twas
like
a
voice
speak
to
me
over
my
shoulder
,
"
take
the
bundle
;
be
quick
;
do
it
this
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
sooner
say
<EOS>
but
I
step
into
the
shop
,
and
with
my
back
to
the
wench
,
as
if
I
have
stand
up
for
a
cart
that
be
go
by
,
I
put
my
hand
behind
me
and
take
the
bundle
,
and
go
off
with
it
,
the
maid
or
the
fellow
not
perceive
me
,
or
any
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
horror
of
my
soul
all
the
while
I
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
away
<EOS>
I
have
no
heart
to
run
,
or
scarce
to
mend
my
pace
.
 
<EOS>
I
cross
the
street
indeed
,
and
go
down
the
first
turn
I
come
to
,
and
I
think
it
be
a
street
that
go
through
into
Fenchurch
Street
.
 
<EOS>
from
thence
I
cross
and
turn
through
so
many
way
and
turning
,
that
I
could
never
tell
which
way
<EOS>
it
be
,
not
where
I
go
;
for
I
feel
not
the
ground
I
step
on
,
and
the
farther
I
be
out
of
danger
,
the
faster
I
go
,
till
,
tired
and
out
of
breath
,
I
be
force
to
sit
down
on
a
little
bench
at
a
door
,
and
then
I
begin
to
recover
,
and
find
I
be
get
into
Thames
Street
,
near
Billingsgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
rest
me
a
little
and
go
on
;
my
blood
be
all
in
a
fire
;
my
heart
beat
as
if
I
be
in
a
sudden
fright
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
under
such
a
surprise
that
I
still
know
not
wither
I
be
go
,
or
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
tire
myself
thus
with
walk
a
long
way
about
,
and
so
eagerly
,
I
begin
to
consider
and
make
home
to
my
lodging
,
where
I
come
about
nine
o'clock
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
bundle
be
make
up
for
,
or
on
what
occasion
lay
where
I
find
it
,
I
know
not
,
but
when
I
come
to
open
it
I
find
there
be
a
suit
of
childbed
-
linen
in
it
,
very
good
and
almost
new
,
the
lace
very
fine
;
there
be
a
silver
porringer
of
a
pint
,
a
small
silver
mug
and
six
spoon
,
with
some
other
linen
,
a
good
smock
,
and
three
silk
handkerchief
,
and
in
the
mug
,
wrap
up
in
a
paper
,
18
.
<EOS>
6d
.
<EOS>
in
money
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
while
I
be
open
these
thing
I
be
under
such
dreadful
impression
of
fear
,
and
I
such
terror
of
mind
,
though
I
be
perfectly
safe
,
that
I
can
not
express
the
manner
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
me
down
,
and
cry
most
vehemently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
be
I
now
?
<EOS>
a
thief
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
shall
be
take
next
time
,
and
be
carry
to
Newgate
and
be
try
for
my
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
with
that
I
cry
again
a
long
time
,
and
I
be
sure
,
as
poor
as
I
be
,
if
I
have
durst
for
fear
,
I
would
certainly
have
carry
the
thing
back
again
;
but
that
go
off
after
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
go
to
bed
for
that
night
,
but
sleep
little
;
the
horror
of
the
fact
be
upon
my
mind
,
and
I
know
not
what
I
say
or
do
all
night
,
and
all
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
be
impatient
to
hear
some
news
of
the
loss
;
and
would
fain
know
how
it
be
,
whether
they
be
a
poor
body
's
good
,
or
a
rich
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
may
be
some
poor
widow
like
me
,
that
have
pack
up
these
good
to
go
and
sell
them
for
a
little
bread
for
herself
and
a
poor
child
,
and
be
now
starve
and
break
their
heart
for
want
of
that
little
they
would
have
fetch
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
this
thought
torment
me
bad
than
all
the
rest
,
for
three
or
four
day
'
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
own
distress
silence
all
these
reflection
,
and
the
prospect
of
my
own
starving
,
which
grow
every
day
more
frightful
to
me
,
harden
my
heart
by
degree
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
particularly
heavy
upon
my
mind
,
that
I
have
be
reform
,
and
have
,
as
I
hope
,
repent
of
all
my
past
wickedness
;
that
I
have
live
a
sober
,
grave
,
retired
life
for
several
year
,
but
now
I
should
be
drive
by
the
dreadful
necessity
of
my
circumstance
to
the
gate
of
destruction
,
soul
and
body
;
and
two
or
three
time
I
fall
upon
my
knee
,
pray
to
God
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
for
deliverance
;
but
I
can
not
but
say
,
my
prayer
have
no
hope
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
do
;
it
be
all
fear
without
,
and
dark
within
;
and
I
reflect
on
my
past
life
as
not
sincerely
repent
of
,
that
Heaven
be
now
begin
to
punish
me
on
this
side
the
grave
,
and
would
make
me
as
miserable
as
I
have
be
wicked
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
go
on
here
<EOS>
I
have
perhaps
be
a
true
penitent
;
but
I
have
an
evil
counsellor
within
,
and
he
be
continually
prompt
me
to
relieve
myself
by
the
bad
mean
;
so
one
evening
he
tempt
me
again
,
by
the
same
wicked
impulse
that
have
say
"
take
that
bundle
,
"
to
go
out
again
and
seek
for
what
may
happen
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
out
now
by
daylight
,
and
wander
about
<EOS>
I
know
not
whither
,
and
in
search
of
I
know
not
what
,
when
the
devil
put
a
snare
in
my
way
of
a
dreadful
nature
indeed
,
and
such
a
one
as
I
have
never
have
before
or
since
.
 
<EOS>
go
through
Aldersgate
Street
,
there
be
a
pretty
little
child
who
have
be
at
a
dancing
-
school
,
and
be
go
home
,
all
alone
;
and
my
prompter
,
like
a
true
devil
,
set
me
upon
this
innocent
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
talk
to
it
,
and
it
prattle
to
me
again
,
and
I
take
it
by
the
hand
and
lead
it
along
till
I
come
to
a
paved
alley
that
go
into
Bartholomew
Close
,
and
I
lead
it
in
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
say
that
be
not
its
way
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
it
be
;
I
will
show
you
the
way
home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
child
have
a
little
necklace
on
of
gold
bead
,
and
I
have
my
eye
upon
that
,
and
in
the
dark
of
the
alley
I
stoop
,
pretend
to
mend
the
child
's
clog
that
be
loose
,
and
take
off
her
necklace
,
and
the
child
never
feel
it
,
and
so
lead
the
child
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
I
say
,
the
devil
put
me
upon
kill
the
child
in
the
dark
alley
,
that
it
may
not
cry
,
but
the
very
thought
fright
me
so
that
I
be
ready
to
drop
down
;
but
I
turn
the
child
about
and
bade
it
go
back
again
,
for
that
be
not
its
way
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
say
,
so
she
would
,
and
I
go
through
into
Bartholomew
Close
,
and
then
turn
round
to
another
passage
that
go
into
St.
John
Street
;
then
,
cross
into
Smithfield
,
go
down
Chick
Lane
and
into
Field
Lane
to
Holborn
Bridge
,
when
,
mix
with
the
crowd
of
people
usually
pass
there
,
it
be
not
possible
to
have
be
find
out
;
and
thus
I
enterprise
my
second
sally
into
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
the
thought
of
this
booty
put
out
all
the
thought
of
the
first
,
and
the
reflection
I
have
make
wear
quickly
off
;
poverty
,
as
I
have
say
,
harden
my
heart
,
and
my
own
necessity
make
me
regardless
of
anything
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
affair
leave
no
great
concern
upon
me
,
for
as
I
do
the
poor
child
<EOS>
no
harm
<EOS>
,
I
only
say
to
myself
,
<EOS>
I
have
give
the
parent
a
just
reproof
for
their
negligence
in
leave
the
poor
little
lamb
to
come
home
by
itself
,
and
it
would
teach
them
to
take
more
care
of
it
another
time
.
  
<EOS>
this
string
of
bead
be
worth
about
twelve
or
fourteen
pound
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
may
have
be
formerly
the
mother
's
,
for
it
be
too
big
for
the
child
's
wear
,
but
that
perhaps
the
vanity
of
the
mother
,
to
have
her
child
look
fine
at
the
dancing
-
school
,
have
make
her
let
the
child
wear
it
;
and
no
doubt
the
child
have
a
maid
send
to
take
care
of
it
,
but
she
,
careless
jade
,
be
take
up
perhaps
with
some
fellow
that
have
meet
her
by
the
way
,
and
so
the
poor
baby
wander
till
it
fall
into
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
the
child
<EOS>
no
harm
;
I
do
not
so
much
as
fright
<EOS>
it
,
for
I
have
a
great
many
tender
thought
about
me
yet
,
and
do
nothing
but
what
,
as
I
may
say
,
mere
necessity
drive
me
to
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
many
adventure
after
this
,
but
I
be
young
in
the
business
,
and
do
not
know
how
to
manage
,
otherwise
than
as
the
devil
put
thing
into
my
head
;
and
indeed
he
be
seldom
backward
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
one
adventure
<EOS>
I
have
which
be
very
lucky
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
through
Lombard
Street
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
,
just
by
the
end
of
three
King
court
,
when
on
a
sudden
come
a
fellow
run
by
me
as
swift
as
lightning
,
and
throw
a
bundle
that
be
in
his
hand
,
just
behind
me
,
as
I
stand
up
against
the
corner
of
the
house
at
the
turning
into
the
alley
.
<EOS>
just
as
he
throw
it
in
he
say
,
"
God
bless
you
,
mistress
<EOS>
,
let
it
lie
there
a
little
,
"
and
away
he
run
swift
as
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
after
him
come
two
more
,
and
immediately
a
young
fellow
without
his
hat
,
cry
"
stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
and
after
him
two
or
three
more
.
<EOS>
They
pursue
the
two
last
fellow
so
close
,
that
they
be
force
to
drop
what
they
have
get
,
and
one
of
them
be
take
into
the
bargain
,
and
other
get
off
free
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
stock
-
still
all
this
while
,
till
they
come
back
,
drag
the
poor
fellow
they
have
take
,
and
lug
the
thing
they
have
find
,
extremely
well
satisfied
that
they
have
recover
the
booty
and
take
the
thief
;
and
thus
they
pass
by
me
,
for
I
look
only
like
one
who
stand
up
while
the
crowd
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
once
or
twice
I
ask
what
be
the
matter
,
but
the
people
neglect
answer
me
,
and
I
be
not
very
importunate
;
but
after
the
crowd
be
wholly
past
,
I
take
my
opportunity
to
turn
about
and
take
up
what
be
behind
me
and
walk
away
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
I
do
with
less
disturbance
than
I
have
do
formerly
,
for
these
thing
I
do
not
steal
,
but
they
be
steal
to
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
get
safe
to
my
lodging
with
this
cargo
,
which
be
a
piece
of
fine
black
lustring
silk
,
and
a
piece
of
velvet
;
the
latter
be
but
part
of
a
piece
of
about
eleven
yard
;
the
former
be
a
whole
piece
of
near
fifty
yard
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
it
be
a
mercer
's
shop
that
they
have
rifle
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
rifle
,
because
the
good
be
so
considerable
that
they
have
lose
;
for
the
good
that
they
recover
be
pretty
many
,
and
I
believe
come
to
about
six
or
seven
several
piece
of
silk
.
 
<EOS>
how
they
come
to
get
so
many
I
could
not
tell
;
but
as
I
have
only
rob
the
thief
,
I
make
no
scruple
at
take
these
good
,
and
be
very
glad
of
them
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
pretty
good
luck
thus
far
,
and
I
make
several
adventure
more
,
though
with
but
small
purchase
,
yet
with
good
success
,
but
I
go
in
daily
dread
that
some
mischief
would
befall
me
,
and
that
I
should
certainly
come
to
be
hang
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
the
impression
this
make
on
me
be
too
strong
to
be
slight
,
and
it
keep
me
from
make
attempt
that
,
for
ought
I
know
,
may
have
be
very
safely
perform
;
but
one
thing
I
can
not
omit
,
which
be
a
bait
to
me
many
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
frequently
out
into
the
village
round
the
town
,
to
see
if
nothing
would
fall
in
my
way
there
;
and
go
by
a
house
near
Stepney
<EOS>
,
I
see
on
the
window
-
board
two
ring
,
one
a
small
diamond
ring
,
and
the
other
a
gold
ring
,
to
be
sure
lay
there
by
some
thoughtless
lady
,
that
have
more
money
then
forecast
,
perhaps
only
till
she
wash
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
several
time
by
the
window
to
observe
if
I
could
see
whether
there
be
anybody
in
the
room
or
no
,
and
I
could
see
nobody
,
but
still
I
be
not
sure
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
presently
into
my
thought
to
rap
at
the
glass
,
as
if
I
want
to
speak
with
somebody
,
and
if
anybody
be
there
they
would
be
sure
to
come
to
the
window
,
and
then
I
would
tell
them
to
remove
those
ring
,
for
that
I
have
see
two
suspicious
fellow
take
notice
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
ready
thought
.
 
<EOS>
I
rap
once
or
twice
and
nobody
come
,
when
,
see
the
coast
clear
,
I
thrust
hard
against
the
square
of
the
glass
,
and
break
it
with
very
little
noise
,
and
take
 
out
the
two
ring
,
and
walk
away
with
them
very
safe
.
 
<EOS>
the
diamond
ring
be
worth
about
#
#
#
#
3
,
and
the
other
about
9s
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
at
a
loss
for
a
market
for
my
good
,
and
especially
for
my
two
piece
of
silk
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
loth
to
dispose
of
them
for
a
trifle
,
as
the
poor
unhappy
thief
in
general
do
,
who
,
after
they
have
venture
their
life
for
perhaps
a
thing
of
value
,
be
fain
to
sell
it
for
a
song
when
they
have
do
;
but
I
be
resolve
I
would
not
do
thus
,
whatever
shift
I
make
,
unless
I
be
drive
to
the
last
extremity
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
well
know
what
course
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
resolve
to
go
to
my
old
governess
,
and
acquaint
myself
with
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
punctually
supply
the
#
#
#
#
5
a
year
to
her
for
my
little
boy
as
long
as
I
be
able
,
but
at
last
be
oblige
to
put
a
stop
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
write
a
letter
to
her
,
wherein
I
have
tell
her
that
my
circumstance
be
reduce
very
low
;
that
I
have
lose
my
husband
,
and
that
I
be
not
able
to
do
it
any
longer
,
and
so
beg
that
the
poor
child
may
not
suffer
too
much
for
its
mother
's
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
make
her
a
visit
,
and
I
find
that
she
drive
something
of
the
old
trade
still
,
but
that
she
be
not
in
such
flourish
circumstance
as
before
;
for
she
have
be
sue
by
a
certain
gentleman
who
have
have
his
daughter
steal
from
him
,
and
who
,
it
seem
,
she
have
help
to
convey
away
;
and
it
be
very
narrowly
that
she
escape
the
gallow
.
 
<EOS>
the
expense
also
have
ravage
her
,
and
she
be
become
very
poor
;
her
house
be
but
meanly
furnished
,
and
she
be
not
in
such
repute
for
her
practice
as
before
;
however
,
she
stand
upon
her
leg
,
as
they
say
,
and
a
she
be
a
stirring
,
bustle
woman
,
and
have
some
stock
leave
,
she
be
turn
pawnbroker
,
and
live
pretty
well
.
  
<EOS>
She
receive
me
very
civilly
,
and
with
her
usual
obliging
manner
tell
me
she
would
not
have
the
less
respect
for
me
for
my
be
reduce
;
that
she
have
take
care
<EOS>
my
boy
be
very
well
look
after
,
though
I
could
not
pay
for
him
,
and
that
the
woman
that
have
him
be
easy
,
so
that
I
need
not
to
trouble
myself
about
him
till
I
may
be
better
able
to
do
it
effectually
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
I
have
not
much
money
leave
,
but
that
I
have
some
thing
that
be
money
's
worth
,
if
she
could
tell
me
how
I
may
turn
them
into
money
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
me
what
it
be
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
pull
out
the
string
of
gold
bead
,
and
tell
her
it
be
one
of
my
husband
's
present
to
me
;
then
I
show
her
the
two
parcel
of
silk
,
which
I
tell
her
I
have
from
Ireland
,
and
bring
up
to
town
with
me
;
and
the
little
diamond
ring
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
small
parcel
of
plate
and
spoon
,
I
have
find
mean
to
dispose
of
them
myself
before
;
and
as
for
the
childbed
-
linen
<EOS>
I
have
,
she
offer
me
to
take
it
herself
,
believe
it
to
have
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
She
tell
me
that
she
be
turn
pawnbroker
,
and
that
she
would
sell
those
thing
for
me
as
pawn
to
her
;
and
so
she
send
presently
for
proper
agent
that
buy
them
,
be
in
her
hand
,
without
any
scruple
,
and
give
good
price
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
think
this
necessary
woman
may
help
me
a
little
in
my
low
condition
to
some
business
,
for
I
would
gladly
have
turn
my
hand
to
any
honest
employment
if
I
could
have
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
she
be
deficient
;
honest
business
do
not
come
within
her
reach
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
young
,
perhaps
she
may
have
help
me
to
a
spark
,
but
my
thought
be
off
that
kind
of
livelihood
,
as
be
quite
out
of
the
way
after
fifty
,
which
be
my
case
,
and
so
I
tell
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
invite
me
at
last
to
come
,
and
be
at
her
house
till
I
could
find
something
to
do
,
and
it
should
cost
me
very
little
,
and
this
I
gladly
accept
of
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
live
a
little
easy
,
I
enter
into
some
measure
to
have
my
little
son
by
my
last
husband
<EOS>
take
off
;
and
this
she
make
easy
too
,
reserve
a
payment
only
of
#
#
#
#
5
a
year
,
if
I
could
pay
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
such
a
help
to
me
,
<EOS>
that
for
a
good
while
I
leave
off
the
wicked
trade
that
I
have
so
newly
take
up
;
and
gladly
I
would
have
get
my
bread
by
the
help
of
my
needle
if
I
could
have
get
work
,
but
that
be
very
hard
to
do
for
one
that
have
no
manner
of
acquaintance
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
I
get
some
quilting
work
for
lady
'
bed
,
petticoat
,
and
the
like
;
and
this
I
like
very
well
,
and
work
very
hard
,
and
with
this
I
begin
to
live
;
but
the
diligent
devil
,
who
resolve
<EOS>
I
should
continue
in
his
service
,
continually
prompt
me
to
go
out
and
take
a
walk
,
that
be
to
say
,
to
see
if
anything
would
offer
in
the
old
way
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
I
blindly
obey
his
summon
,
and
fetch
a
long
circuit
through
the
street
,
but
meet
with
no
purchase
,
and
come
home
very
weary
and
empty
;
but
not
content
with
that
<EOS>
,
I
go
out
the
next
evening
too
,
when
go
by
an
alehouse
<EOS>
I
see
the
door
of
a
little
room
open
,
next
the
very
street
,
and
on
the
table
a
silver
tankard
,
thing
much
in
use
in
public
-
house
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
some
company
have
be
drink
there
,
and
the
careless
boy
have
forget
to
take
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
box
frankly
,
and
set
the
silver
tankard
on
the
corner
of
the
bench
,
I
sit
down
before
it
,
and
knock
with
my
foot
;
a
boy
come
presently
,
and
I
bade
him
fetch
me
a
pint
of
warm
ale
,
for
it
be
cold
weather
;
the
boy
run
,
and
I
hear
him
go
down
the
cellar
to
draw
the
ale
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
boy
be
go
,
another
boy
come
into
the
room
,
and
cry
,
"
D
"
ye
call
?
<EOS>
"
I
speak
with
a
melancholy
air
,
and
say
,
"
no
,
child
;
the
boy
be
go
for
a
pint
of
ale
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
I
sit
here
,
I
hear
the
woman
in
the
bar
say
,
"
be
they
all
go
in
the
five
?
"
<EOS>
which
be
the
box
I
sit
in
,
and
the
boy
say
,
"
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
fetch
the
tankard
away
?
"
say
the
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
say
another
boy
;
"
that
be
it
,
"
point
,
it
seem
,
to
another
tankard
,
which
he
have
fetch
from
another
box
by
mistake
;
or
else
it
must
be
,
that
the
rogue
forget
that
he
have
not
bring
it
in
,
which
certainly
he
have
not
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
all
this
,
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
for
I
find
plainly
that
the
tankard
be
not
miss
,
and
yet
they
conclude
it
be
fetch
away
;
so
I
drank
my
ale
,
call
to
pay
,
and
as
I
go
away
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
take
care
of
your
plate
,
child
,
"
mean
a
silver
pint
mug
,
which
he
bring
me
drink
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
say
,
"
yes
,
madam
,
very
welcome
,
"
and
away
I
come
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
home
to
my
governess
,
and
now
I
think
it
be
a
time
to
try
her
,
that
if
I
may
be
put
to
the
necessity
of
be
expose
,
she
may
offer
me
some
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
be
at
home
some
time
,
and
have
an
opportunity
of
talk
to
her
,
I
tell
her
I
have
a
secret
of
the
great
consequence
in
the
world
to
commit
to
her
,
if
she
have
respect
enough
for
me
to
keep
it
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
she
have
keep
one
of
my
secret
faithfully
;
why
should
I
doubt
her
keep
another
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
the
strange
thing
in
the
world
have
befall
me
,
and
that
it
have
make
a
thief
of
me
,
even
without
any
design
,
and
so
tell
her
the
whole
story
of
the
tankard
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
have
you
bring
it
away
with
you
,
my
dear
?
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
I
have
,
"
say
I
,
and
show
it
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
shall
I
do
now
,
"
say
I
;
"
must
not
carry
it
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
carry
it
again
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
if
you
be
minded
to
be
send
to
Newgate
for
steal
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
they
can
not
be
so
base
to
stop
me
,
when
I
carry
it
to
them
again
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
those
sort
of
people
,
child
,
"
say
she
;
"
they
will
not
only
carry
you
to
Newgate
,
but
hang
you
too
,
without
any
regard
to
the
honesty
of
return
it
;
or
bring
in
an
account
of
all
the
other
tankard
they
have
lose
,
for
you
to
pay
for
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
must
I
do
,
then
?
"
say
I.
 
"
Nay
,
"
say
she
,
"
as
you
have
play
the
cunning
part
and
steal
it
<EOS>
,
you
must
e'en
keep
it
;
there
be
no
go
back
now
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
child
<EOS>
,
"
say
she
,
"
do
not
you
want
it
more
than
they
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
light
of
such
a
bargain
once
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
give
me
a
new
notion
of
my
governess
,
and
that
since
she
be
turn
pawnbroker
,
she
have
a
sort
of
people
about
her
that
be
none
of
the
honest
one
that
I
have
meet
with
there
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
long
there
<EOS>
but
I
discover
it
more
plainly
than
before
,
for
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
I
see
hilt
of
sword
,
spoon
,
fork
,
tankard
,
and
all
such
kind
of
ware
bring
in
,
not
to
be
pawn
,
but
to
be
sell
downright
;
and
she
buy
everything
that
come
without
ask
any
question
,
but
have
very
good
bargain
,
as
I
find
by
her
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
also
that
in
follow
this
trade
she
always
melt
down
the
plate
she
buy
,
that
it
may
not
be
challenge
;
and
she
come
to
me
and
tell
me
one
morning
that
she
be
go
to
melt
,
and
if
I
would
,
she
would
put
my
tankard
in
,
that
it
may
not
be
see
by
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
with
all
my
heart
;
so
she
weigh
it
,
and
allow
me
the
full
value
in
silver
again
;
but
I
find
she
do
not
do
the
same
to
the
rest
of
her
customer
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
,
as
I
be
at
work
,
and
very
melancholy
,
she
begin
to
ask
me
what
the
matter
be
,
as
she
be
use
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
my
heart
be
heavy
;
I
have
little
work
,
and
nothing
to
live
on
,
and
know
not
what
course
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
She
laugh
,
and
tell
me
I
must
go
out
again
and
try
my
fortune
;
it
may
be
that
I
may
meet
with
another
piece
of
plate
.
"
<EOS>
o
mother
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
that
be
a
trade
I
have
no
skill
in
,
and
if
I
should
be
take
I
be
undo
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
say
she
,
"
I
could
help
you
to
a
schoolmistress
that
shall
make
you
as
dexterous
as
herself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
at
 
<EOS>
that
proposal
,
for
hitherto
I
have
have
no
confederate
,
nor
any
acquaintance
among
that
tribe
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
conquer
all
my
modesty
,
and
all
my
fear
;
and
in
a
little
time
,
by
the
help
of
this
confederate
,
I
grow
as
impudent
a
thief
,
and
as
dexterous
as
ever
Moll
Cutpurse
be
,
though
,
if
fame
do
not
belie
her
,
not
half
so
handsome
.
  
<EOS>
the
comrade
she
help
me
to
dealt
in
three
sort
of
craft
,
viz
.
<EOS>
shoplifting
,
steal
of
shop
-
book
and
pocket
-
book
,
and
take
off
gold
watch
from
the
lady
'
side
;
and
this
last
she
do
so
dexterously
that
no
woman
ever
arrive
to
the
performance
of
that
art
so
as
to
do
it
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
the
first
and
the
last
of
these
thing
very
well
,
and
I
attend
her
some
time
in
the
practice
,
just
as
a
deputy
attend
a
midwife
,
without
any
pay
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
she
put
me
to
practice
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
show
me
her
art
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
several
time
unhook
a
watch
from
her
own
side
with
great
dexterity
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
show
me
a
prize
,
and
this
be
a
young
lady
big
with
child
,
who
have
a
charming
watch
.
<EOS>
the
thing
be
to
be
do
as
she
come
out
of
church
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
on
one
side
of
the
lady
,
and
pretend
,
just
as
she
come
to
the
step
,
to
fall
,
and
fall
against
the
lady
with
so
much
violence
as
put
her
into
a
great
fright
,
and
both
cry
out
terribly
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
very
moment
that
she
jostle
the
lady
,
I
have
hold
of
the
watch
,
and
hold
it
the
right
way
,
the
start
she
give
draw
the
hook
out
,
and
she
never
feel
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
off
immediately
,
and
leave
my
schoolmistress
to
come
out
of
her
pretend
fright
gradually
,
and
the
lady
too
;
and
presently
the
watch
be
miss
.
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
my
comrade
,
"
then
it
be
those
rogue
that
thrust
me
down
,
I
warrant
ye
;
I
wonder
the
gentlewoman
do
not
miss
her
watch
before
,
then
we
may
have
take
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
humour
the
thing
so
well
that
nobody
suspect
her
,
and
I
be
get
home
a
full
hour
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
my
first
adventure
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
the
watch
be
indeed
a
very
fine
one
,
and
have
a
great
many
trinket
about
it
,
and
my
governess
allow
us
#
#
#
#
20
for
it
,
of
which
I
have
half
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
I
be
enter
a
complete
thief
,
harden
to
the
pitch
above
all
the
reflection
of
conscience
or
modesty
,
and
to
a
degree
which
I
must
acknowledge
I
never
think
possible
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
devil
,
who
begin
,
by
the
help
of
an
irresistible
poverty
,
to
push
me
into
this
wickedness
,
bring
me
on
to
a
height
beyond
the
common
rate
,
even
when
my
necessity
be
not
so
great
,
or
the
prospect
of
my
misery
so
terrifying
;
for
I
have
now
get
into
a
little
vein
of
work
,
and
as
I
be
not
at
a
loss
to
handle
my
needle
,
it
be
very
probable
,
<EOS>
as
acquaintance
come
in
,
I
may
have
get
my
bread
honestly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
that
if
such
a
prospect
of
work
have
present
itself
at
first
,
when
I
begin
to
feel
the
approach
of
my
miserable
circumstance
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
have
such
a
prospect
of
get
my
bread
by
work
present
itself
then
<EOS>
,
I
have
never
fall
into
this
wicked
trade
,
or
into
such
a
wicked
gang
as
I
be
now
embark
with
;
but
practice
have
harden
me
,
and
I
grow
audacious
to
the
last
degree
;
and
the
more
so
because
I
have
carry
it
on
so
long
,
and
have
never
be
take
;
for
,
in
a
word
,
my
new
partner
in
wickedness
<EOS>
and
I
go
on
together
so
long
,
without
be
ever
detect
,
that
we
not
only
grow
bold
,
but
we
grow
rich
,
and
we
have
at
one
time
one
-
and
-
twenty
gold
watch
in
our
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
that
one
day
be
a
little
more
serious
than
ordinary
,
and
find
I
have
so
good
a
stock
beforehand
as
I
have
,
for
I
have
near
#
#
#
#
200
in
money
for
my
share
,
it
come
strongly
into
my
mind
,
no
doubt
from
some
kind
spirit
,
if
such
there
be
,
that
at
first
poverty
excite
me
,
and
my
distress
drive
me
to
these
dreadful
shift
;
so
see
those
distress
be
now
relieve
,
and
I
could
also
get
something
towards
a
maintenance
by
work
,
and
have
so
good
a
bank
to
support
me
,
why
should
I
now
not
leave
off
,
as
they
say
,
while
I
be
well
?
<EOS>
that
I
could
not
expect
to
go
always
free
;
and
if
I
be
once
surprised
,
and
miscarry
,
I
be
undone
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
doubtless
the
happy
minute
,
when
,
if
I
have
hearken
to
the
bless
hint
,
from
whatsoever
have
it
come
,
I
have
still
a
cast
for
an
easy
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
fate
be
otherwise
determine
;
the
busy
devil
that
so
industriously
draw
me
in
have
too
fast
hold
of
me
to
let
me
go
back
;
but
as
poverty
bring
me
into
the
mire
,
so
avarice
keep
me
in
,
till
there
be
no
go
back
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
 
argument
which
my
reason
dictate
for
persuade
me
to
lay
down
,
avarice
step
in
and
say
,
"
go
on
,
go
on
;
you
have
have
very
good
luck
;
go
on
till
you
have
get
four
or
five
hundred
pound
,
and
they
you
shall
leave
off
,
and
then
you
may
live
easy
without
work
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
I
,
that
be
once
in
the
devil
's
clutch
,
be
hold
fast
there
as
with
a
charm
,
and
have
no
power
to
go
without
the
circle
,
till
I
be
engulf
in
labyrinth
of
trouble
too
great
to
get
out
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
these
thought
leave
some
impression
upon
me
,
and
make
me
act
with
some
more
caution
than
before
,
and
more
than
my
director
use
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
My
comrade
,
as
I
call
her
,
but
<EOS>
rather
she
should
have
be
call
my
teacher
,
with
another
of
her
scholar
<EOS>
,
be
the
first
in
the
misfortune
;
for
,
happen
to
be
upon
the
hunt
for
purchase
,
they
make
an
attempt
upon
a
linen
-
draper
in
Cheapside
,
but
be
snap
by
a
hawk's
-
eyed
journeyman
,
and
seize
with
two
piece
of
cambric
,
which
be
take
also
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
enough
to
lodge
them
both
in
Newgate
,
where
they
have
the
misfortune
to
have
some
of
their
former
sin
bring
to
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
two
other
indictment
be
bring
against
them
,
and
the
fact
be
prove
upon
them
,
they
be
both
condemn
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
plead
their
belly
,
and
be
both
vote
quick
with
child
;
though
my
tutoress
be
no
more
with
child
than
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
frequently
to
see
them
,
and
condole
with
them
,
expect
that
it
would
be
my
turn
next
;
but
the
place
give
me
so
much
horror
,
reflect
that
it
be
the
place
of
my
unhappy
birth
,
and
of
my
mother
's
misfortune
,
and
that
I
could
not
bear
it
,
so
I
be
force
to
leave
off
go
to
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
oh
!
could
I
have
but
take
warning
by
their
disaster
<EOS>
,
I
have
be
happy
still
,
for
I
be
yet
free
,
and
have
nothing
bring
against
me
;
but
it
could
not
be
,
my
measure
be
not
yet
fill
up
.
  
<EOS>
My
comrade
,
have
the
brand
of
an
old
offender
,
be
execute
;
the
young
offender
be
spare
,
have
obtain
a
reprieve
,
but
lie
starve
a
long
while
in
prison
,
till
at
last
she
get
her
name
into
what
they
call
a
circuit
pardon
,
and
so
come
off
.
  
<EOS>
this
terrible
example
of
my
comrade
fright
me
heartily
,
and
for
a
good
while
I
make
no
excursion
;
but
one
night
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
my
governess
's
house
,
they
cry
"
Fire
.
<EOS>
"
My
governess
look
out
,
for
we
be
all
up
,
and
cry
immediately
that
such
a
gentlewoman
's
house
be
all
of
a
light
fire
atop
,
and
so
indeed
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
here
she
give
me
a
job
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
there
be
a
rare
opportunity
,
for
the
fire
be
so
near
that
you
may
go
to
it
before
the
street
be
block
up
with
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
presently
give
me
my
cue
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
to
the
house
,
and
run
in
and
tell
the
lady
,
or
anybody
you
see
,
that
you
come
to
help
them
,
and
that
you
come
from
such
a
gentlewoman
(
that
is

scream
as
loud

"

<EOS>
the
poor

,
half
out
of
her

,
with
a
bundle
under
her
arm

an
two

and
immediately
I
take
one
of
them
out
of

,
and
she
lift
the
other
up
into
my
arm

<EOS>
and
away
she
run
from
me
out
of
her
wit
,
and
the
maid
after
her
;
and
away
come
I
with
the
two
child
and
the
bundle
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
no
sooner
get
into
the
street
<EOS>
but
I
see
another
woman
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
she
,
"
mistress
,
"
in
a
piteous
tone
,
"
you
will
let

the
child

<EOS>
Come
,
this
be
a
sad
time
;
let
me
help
you
"
;
and
immediately
lay
hold
of
my
bundle
to
carry
it
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
I
;
"
if
you
will
help
me
,
take
the
child
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
it
for
me
but
to
the
upper
end
of
the
street
;
I
will
go
with
you
and
satisfy
you
for
your
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
aviod
go
,
after
what
I
say
;
but
the
creature
,
in
short
,
be
one
of
the
same
business
with
me
,
and
want
nothing
but
the
bundle
;
however
,
she
go
with
me
to
the
door
,
for
she
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
be
come
there
I
whisper
her
,
"
go
,
child
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
understand
your
trade
;
you
may
meet
with
purchase
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
understand
me
and
walk
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
thunder
at
the
door
with
the
child
,
and
as
the
people
be
raise
before
by
the
noise
of
the
fire
,
I
be
soon
let
in
,
and
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
be
madam
awake
?
 
<EOS>
pray
tell
her
Mrs.
#
#
#
#
 
desire
the
favour
of
her
to
take
the
two
child
in
;
poor
lady
,
she
will
be
undo
,
their
house
be
all
of
a
flame
,
"
 
They
take
the
child
in
very
civilly
,
pity
the
family
in
distress
,
and
away
come
I
with
my
bundle
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
maid
ask
me
if
 
I
be
not
to
leave
the
bundle
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
no
,
sweetheart
,
'
tis
to
go
to
another
place
;
it
do
not
belong
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
great
way
out
of
the
hurry
now
,
and
so
I
go
on
,
clear
of
anybody
's
inquiry
,
and
bring
the
bundle
of
plate
,
which
be
very
considerable
,
straight
home
,
and
give
it
to
my
old
governess
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
she
would
not
look
into
it
,
but
bade
me
<EOS>
go
out
again
to
look
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
the
like
cue
to
the
gentlewoman
of
the
next
house
to
that
which
be
on
fire
,
and
I
do
my
endeavour
to
go
,
but
by
this
time
the
alarm
of
fire
be
so
great
,
and
so
many
engine
play
,
and
the
street
so
throng
with
people
,
that
I
could
not
get
near
the
house
whatever
I
would
do
;
so
I
come
back
again
to
my
governess
's
,
and
take
the
bundle
up
into
my
chamber
<EOS>
,
I
begin
to
examine
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
horror
that
I
tell
what
a
treasure
<EOS>
I
find
there
;
'
tis
enough
to
say
,
that
besides
most
of
the
family
plate
,
which
be
considerable
,
I
find
a
gold
chain
,
an
old
-
fashioned
thing
,
the
locket
of
which
be
break
,
so
that
I
suppose
it
have
not
be
use
some
year
,
but
the
gold
be
not
the
bad
for
that
;
also
a
little
box
of
burying
-
ring
,
the
lady
's
wedding
-
ring
,
and
some
broken
bit
of
old
locket
of
gold
,
a
gold
watch
,
and
a
purse
with
about
#
#
#
#
24
value
in
old
piece
of
gold
coin
,
and
several
other
thing
of
value
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
great
and
the
bad
prize
that
ever
I
be
concern
in
;
for
indeed
,
though
,
as
I
have
say
above
,
I
be
harden
now
beyond
the
power
of
all
reflection
in
other
case
,
yet
it
really
touch
me
to
the
very
soul
when
I
look
into
this
treasure
,
to
think
of
the
poor
disconsolate
gentlewoman
who
have
lose
so
much
by
the
fire
besides
;
and
who
would
think
,
to
be
sure
,
that
she
have
save
her
plate
and
good
thing
;
how
she
would
be
surprised
and
afflict
when
she
should
find
that
she
have
be
deceive
,
and
should
find
that
the
person
that
take
her
child
and
her
good
,
have
not
come
,
as
be
pretend
,
from
the
gentlewoman
in
the
next
street
,
but
that
the
child
have
be
put
upon
her
without
her
own
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
confess
the
inhumanity
of
this
action
move
me
very
much
,
and
make
me
relent
exceedingly
,
and
tear
stand
in
my
eye
upon
that
subject
;
but
with
all
my
sense
of
its
be
cruel
and
inhuman
,
I
could
never
find
in
my
heart
to
make
any
restitution
.
 
<EOS>
the
reflection
wear
off
,
and
I
begin
quickly
to
forget
the
circumstance
that
attend
the
take
them
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
this
all
;
for
though
by
this
job
I
be
become
considerably
rich
than
before
,
yet
the
resolution
I
have
formerly
take
,
of
leave
off
this
horrid
trade
when
I
have
get
a
little
more
,
do
not
return
,
but
I
must
still
get
farth
,
and
more
;
and
the
avarice
join
so
with
the
success
,
that
I
have
no
more
thought
of
come
to
a
timely
alteration
of
life
,
though
without
it
I
could
expect
no
safety
,
no
tranquillity
in
the
possession
of
what
I
have
so
wickedly
gain
;
but
a
little
more
,
and
a
little
more
,
be
the
case
still
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
yield
to
the
importunity
of
my
crime
,
I
cast
off
all
remorse
and
repentance
,
and
all
the
reflection
on
that
head
turn
to
no
more
than
this
,
that
I
may
perhaps
come
to
have
one
booty
more
that
may
complete
my
desire
;
but
though
I
certainly
have
that
one
booty
,
yet
every
hit
look
towards
another
,
and
be
so
encouraging
to
me
to
go
on
with
the
trade
,
that
I
have
no
gust
to
the
thought
of
lay
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
,
harden
by
success
,
and
resolve
to
go
on
,
I
fall
into
the
snare
in
which
I
be
appoint
to
meet
with
my
last
reward
for
this
kind
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
this
be
not
yet
,
for
I
meet
with
several
successful
adventure
more
in
this
way
of
be
undo
.
  
<EOS>
I
remain
still
with
my
governess
,
who
be
for
a
while
really
concerned
for
the
misfortune
of
my
comrade
that
have
be
hang
,
and
who
,
it
seem
,
know
enough
of
my
governess
to
have
send
her
the
same
way
,
and
which
make
her
very
uneasy
;
indeed
,
she
be
in
a
very
great
fright
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
when
she
be
go
,
and
have
not
open
mouth
to
tell
what
she
know
,
my
governess
be
easy
as
to
that
point
,
and
perhaps
glad
she
be
hang
,
for
it
be
in
her
power
to
have
obtain
a
pardon
at
the
expense
of
her
friend
;
but
on
the
other
hand
,
the
loss
of
her
,
and
the
sense
of
her
kindness
in
not
make
her
market
of
what
she
know
,
move
my
governess
to
mourn
very
sincerely
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
comfort
her
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
she
in
return
harden
me
to
merit
more
completely
the
same
fate
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
have
say
,
it
make
me
the
more
wary
,
and
particularly
I
be
very
shy
of
shoplifting
,
especially
among
the
mercer
and
draper
,
who
be
a
set
of
fellow
that
have
their
eye
very
much
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
venture
or
two
among
the
lace
folk
and
the
milliner
,
and
particularly
at
one
shop
where
I
get
notice
of
two
young
woman
who
be
newly
set
up
,
and
have
not
be
breed
to
the
trade
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
think
I
carry
off
a
piece
of
bone
-
lace
,
worth
six
or
seven
pound
,
and
a
paper
of
thread
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
but
once
<EOS>
;
it
be
a
trick
that
would
not
serve
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
always
reckon
a
safe
job
when
we
hear
of
a
new
shop
,
and
especially
when
the
people
be
such
as
be
not
breed
to
shop
.
 
<EOS>
such
may
depend
upon
it
that
they
will
be
visit
once
or
twice
at
their
beginning
,
and
they
must
be
very
sharp
indeed
if
they
can
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
another
adventure
or
two
,
but
they
be
but
trifle
too
,
though
sufficient
to
live
on
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
nothing
considerable
offering
for
a
good
while
,
I
begin
to
think
that
I
must
give
over
the
trade
in
earnest
;
but
my
governess
,
who
be
not
willing
to
lose
me
,
and
expect
great
thing
of
me
,
bring
me
one
day
into
company
with
a
young
woman
and
a
fellow
that
go
for
her
husband
,
though
as
it
appear
afterwards
,
she
be
not
his
wife
,
but
they
be
partner
,
it
seem
,
in
the
trade
they
carry
on
,
and
partner
in
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
they
rob
together
,
lie
together
,
be
take
together
,
and
at
last
be
hang
together
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
into
a
kind
of
league
with
these
two
by
the
help
of
my
governess
,
and
they
carry
me
out
into
three
or
four
adventure
,
where
I
rather
see
them
commit
some
coarse
and
unhandy
robbery
,
in
which
nothing
but
a
great
stock
of
impudence
on
their
side
,
and
gross
negligence
on
the
people
's
side
who
be
rob
,
could
have
make
them
successful
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
resolve
from
that
time
forward
to
be
very
cautious
how
I
adventure
upon
anything
with
them
;
and
indeed
,
when
two
or
three
unlucky
project
be
propose
by
them
,
I
decline
the
offer
,
and
persuade
them
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
one
time
they
particularly
propose
rob
a
watchmaker
of
three
gold
watch
,
which
they
have
eye
in
the
daytime
,
and
find
the
place
where
he
lay
them
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
have
so
many
key
of
all
kind
,
that
he
make
no
question
to
open
the
place
where
the
watchmaker
have
lay
them
;
and
so
we
make
a
kind
of
an
appointment
;
but
when
I
come
to
look
narrowly
into
the
thing
,
I
find
they
propose
break
open
the
house
,
and
this
,
as
a
thing
out
of
my
way
,
I
would
not
embark
in
,
so
they
go
without
me
.
<EOS>
They
do
get
into
the
house
by
main
force
,
and
break
up
the
lock
place
where
the
watch
be
,
but
find
but
one
of
the
gold
watch
,
and
a
silver
one
,
which
they
take
,
and
get
out
of
the
house
again
very
clear
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
family
,
be
alarm
,
cry
out
"
thief
,
"
and
the
man
be
pursue
and
take
;
the
young
woman
have
get
off
too
,
but
unhappily
be
stop
at
a
distance
,
and
the
watch
find
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
I
have
a
second
escape
,
for
they
be
convict
,
and
both
hang
,
be
old
offender
,
though
but
young
people
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
say
before
that
they
rob
together
and
lie
together
,
so
now
they
hang
together
,
and
there
end
my
new
partnership
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
now
to
be
very
wary
,
have
so
narrowly
escape
a
scouring
,
and
have
such
an
example
before
me
;
but
I
have
a
new
tempter
,
who
prompt
me
every
day
 
<EOS>
I
mean
my
governess
;
and
now
a
prize
present
,
which
as
it
come
by
her
management
,
so
she
expect
a
good
share
of
the
booty
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
quantity
of
flander
lace
lodge
in
a
private
house
,
where
she
have
get
intelligence
of
it
,
and
Flanders
lace
be
prohibit
,
it
be
a
good
booty
to
any
custom
-
house
officer
that
could
come
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
full
account
from
my
governess
,
as
well
of
the
quantity
as
of
the
very
place
where
it
be
conceal
,
and
I
go
to
a
custom
-
house
officer
,
and
tell
him
I
have
such
a
discovery
to
make
to
him
of
such
a
quantity
of
lace
,
if
he
would
assure
me
that
I
should
have
my
due
share
of
the
reward
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
just
an
offer
,
that
nothing
could
be
fair
;
so
he
agree
,
and
take
a
constable
and
me
with
him
,
we
beset
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
tell
him
I
could
go
directly
to
the
place
,
he
leave
it
to
me
;
and
the
hole
be
very
dark
,
I
squeeze
myself
into
it
,
with
a
candle
in
my
hand
,
and
so
reach
the
piece
out
to
him
,
take
care
as
I
give
him
some
so
to
secure
as
much
about
myself
as
I
could
conveniently
dispose
of
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
near
#
#
#
#
300
worth
of
lace
in
the
hole
,
and
I
secure
about
#
#
#
#
50
worth
of
it
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
house
be
not
owner
of
the
lace
,
but
a
merchant
who
have
entrust
them
with
it
;
so
that
they
be
not
so
surprised
as
I
think
they
would
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
the
officer
overjoy
with
his
prize
,
and
fully
satisfied
with
what
he
have
get
,
and
appoint
to
meet
him
at
a
house
of
his
own
directing
,
where
I
come
after
I
have
dispose
of
the
cargo
I
have
about
me
,
of
which
he
have
not
the
least
suspicion
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
him
he
begin
to
capitulate
with
me
,
believe
I
do
not
understand
the
right
I
have
to
a
share
in
the
prize
,
and
would
fain
have
put
me
off
with
#
#
#
#
20
,
but
I
let
him
know
that
I
be
not
so
ignorant
as
he
suppose
I
be
;
and
yet
I
be
glad
,
too
,
that
he
offer
to
bring
me
to
a
certainty
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
#
#
#
#
100
,
and
he
rise
up
to
#
#
#
#
30
;
I
fall
to
#
#
#
#
80
,
and
he
rise
again
to
#
#
#
#
40
;
in
a
word
,
he
offer
#
#
#
#
50
,
and
I
consent
,
only
demand
a
piece
of
lace
,
which
I
though
come
to
about
#
#
#
#
8
or
#
#
#
#
9
,
as
if
it
have
be
for
my
own
wear
,
and
he
agree
to
it
.
<EOS>
so
I
get
#
#
#
#
50
in
money
pay
me
that
same
night
,
and
make
an
end
of
the
bargain
;
nor
do
he
ever
know
who
I
be
,
or
where
to
inquire
for
me
,
so
that
if
it
have
be
discover
that
part
of
the
good
be
embezzle
,
he
could
have
make
no
challenge
upon
me
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
very
punctually
divide
this
spoil
with
my
governess
,
and
I
pass
with
her
from
this
time
for
a
very
dexterous
manager
in
the
nice
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
this
last
be
the
good
and
easy
sort
of
work
that
be
in
my
way
,
and
I
make
it
my
business
to
inquire
out
prohibit
good
,
and
after
buy
some
,
usually
betray
them
,
but
none
of
these
discovery
amount
to
anything
considerable
,
not
like
that
I
relate
just
now
;
but
I
be
willing
to
act
safe
,
and
be
still
cautious
of
run
the
great
risk
which
I
find
other
do
,
and
in
which
they
miscarry
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
thing
of
moment
be
an
attempt
at
a
gentlewoman
's
good
watch
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
in
a
crowd
,
at
a
meeting
-
house
,
where
I
be
in
very
great
danger
of
be
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
full
hold
of
her
watch
,
but
give
a
great
jostle
,
as
if
somebody
have
thrust
me
against
her
,
and
in
the
juncture
give
the
watch
a
fair
pull
<EOS>
,
I
find
it
would
not
come
,
so
I
let
it
go
that
moment
,
and
cry
out
as
if
I
have
be
kill
,
that
somebody
have
trod
upon
my
foot
,
and
that
there
be
certainly
pickpocket
there
,
for
somebody
or
other
have
give
a
pull
at
my
watch
;
for
you
be
to
observe
that
on
these
adventure
we
always
go
very
well
dressed
,
and
I
have
very
good
clothe
on
,
and
a
gold
watch
by
my
side
,
as
like
a
lady
as
other
fold
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
sooner
say
so
,
but
the
other
gentlewoman
cry
out
"
a
pickpocket
"
too
,
for
somebody
,
she
say
,
have
try
to
pull
her
watch
away
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
touch
her
watch
<EOS>
I
be
close
to
her
,
but
when
I
cry
out
I
stop
as
it
be
short
,
and
the
crowd
bear
her
forward
a
little
,
she
make
a
noise
too
,
but
it
be
at
some
distance
from
me
,
so
that
she
do
not
in
the
least
suspect
me
;
but
when
she
cry
out
"
a
pickpocket
,
"
somebody
cry
,
"
<EOS>
ay
,
and
here
have
be
another
!
<EOS>
this
gentlewoman
have
be
attempt
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
that
very
instance
,
a
little
farther
in
the
crowd
,
and
very
luckily
too
,
they
cry
out
"
a
pickpocket
,
"
again
,
and
really
seize
a
young
fellow
in
the
very
act
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
though
unhappy
for
the
wretch
,
be
very
opportunely
for
my
case
,
though
I
have
carry
it
off
handsomely
enough
before
;
but
now
it
be
out
of
doubt
,
and
all
the
loose
part
of
the
crowd
run
that
way
,
and
the
poor
boy
be
deliver
up
to
the
rage
of
the
street
,
which
be
a
cruelty
I
need
not
describe
,
and
which
,
however
,
they
be
always
glad
of
,
rather
than
to
be
send
to
Newgate
,
where
they
lie
often
a
long
time
,
till
they
be
almost
perish
,
and
sometimes
they
be
hang
,
and
the
good
they
can
look
for
,
if
they
be
convict
,
be
to
be
transport
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
narrow
escape
to
me
,
and
I
be
so
frighted
that
I
venture
no
more
at
gold
<EOS>
watch
a
great
while
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
indeed
a
great
many
concur
circumstance
in
this
adventure
which
assist
to
my
escape
;
but
the
chief
be
,
that
the
woman
whose
watch
I
have
pull
at
be
a
fool
;
that
be
to
say
,
she
be
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
attempt
,
which
one
would
have
think
she
should
not
have
be
,
see
she
be
wise
enough
to
fasten
her
watch
so
that
it
could
not
be
slip
up
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
in
such
a
fright
that
she
have
no
thought
about
her
proper
for
the
discovery
;
for
she
,
when
she
feel
the
pull
,
scream
out
,
and
push
herself
forward
,
and
put
all
the
people
about
her
into
disorder
,
but
say
not
a
word
of
her
watch
,
or
of
a
pickpocket
,
for
a
least
two
minute
'
time
,
which
be
time
enough
for
me
,
and
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
for
as
I
have
cry
out
behind
her
,
as
I
have
say
,
and
bear
myself
back
in
the
crowd
as
she
bear
forward
,
there
be
several
people
,
at
least
seven
or
eight
,
the
throng
be
still
move
on
<EOS>
,
that
be
get
between
me
and
her
in
that
time
,
and
then
I
cry
out
"
a
pickpocket
,
"
rather
sooner
than
she
,
or
at
least
as
soon
,
<EOS>
she
may
as
well
be
the
person
suspect
as
I
,
and
the
people
be
confuse
in
their
inquiry
;
whereas
,
have
she
with
a
presence
of
mind
needful
on
such
an
occasion
,
as
soon
as
she
feel
the
pull
,
not
scream
out
as
she
do
,
but
turn
immediately
round
and
seize
the
next
body
that
be
behind
her
,
she
have
infallibly
take
me
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
direction
not
of
the
kind
sort
to
the
fraternity
,
but
'
tis
certainly
a
key
to
the
clue
of
a
pickpocket
's
motion
,
and
whoever
can
follow
it
will
as
certainly
catch
the
thief
as
he
will
be
sure
to
miss
if
he
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
another
adventure
,
which
put
this
matter
out
of
doubt
,
and
which
may
be
an
instruction
for
posterity
in
the
case
of
a
pickpocket
.
 
<EOS>
My
good
old
governess
,
to
give
a
short
touch
at
her
history
,
though
she
have
leave
off
the
trade
,
<EOS>
be
,
as
I
may
say
,
bear
a
pickpocket
,
and
,
as
I
understand
afterwards
,
have
run
through
all
the
several
degree
of
that
art
,
and
yet
have
never
be
take
but
once
,
when
she
be
so
grossly
detect
,
that
she
be
convict
and
order
to
be
transport
;
but
be
a
woman
of
a
rare
tongue
,
and
withal
have
money
in
her
pocket
<EOS>
,
she
find
mean
,
the
ship
put
into
Ireland
for
provision
,
to
get
on
shore
there
,
where
she
live
and
practise
her
old
trade
for
some
year
;
when
fall
into
another
sort
of
bad
company
,
she
turn
midwife
and
procuress
,
and
play
a
hundred
prank
there
,
which
she
give
me
a
little
history
of
in
confidence
between
us
as
we
grow
more
intimate
;
and
it
be
to
this
wicked
creature
that
I
owe
all
the
art
and
dexterity
I
arrive
to
,
in
which
there
be
few
that
ever
go
beyond
me
,
or
that
practise
so
long
without
any
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
after
those
adventure
in
Ireland
,
and
when
she
be
pretty
well
known
in
that
country
,
that
she
leave
Dublin
and
come
over
to
England
,
where
,
the
time
of
her
transportation
be
not
expire
,
she
leave
her
former
trade
,
for
fear
of
fall
into
bad
hand
again
,
for
then
she
be
sure
to
have
go
to
wreck
.
 
<EOS>
here
she
set
up
the
same
trade
she
have
follow
in
Ireland
,
in
which
she
soon
,
by
her
admirable
management
and
good
tongue
,
arrive
to
the
height
which
I
have
already
describe
,
and
indeed
begin
to
be
rich
,
though
her
trade
fall
off
again
afterwards
,
as
I
have
hint
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
mention
thus
much
of
the
history
of
this
woman
here
,
the
well
to
account
for
the
concern
she
have
in
the
wicked
life
I
be
now
lead
,
into
all
the
particular
of
which
she
lead
me
,
as
it
be
,
by
the
hand
,
and
give
me
such
direction
,
and
I
so
well
follow
them
,
that
I
grow
the
great
artist
of
my
time
and
work
myself
out
of
every
danger
with
such
dexterity
,
that
when
several
more
of
my
comrade
run
themselves
into
Newgate
presently
,
and
by
that
time
they
have
be
half
a
year
at
the
trade
,
I
have
now
practise
upward
of
five
year
,
and
the
people
at
Newgate
do
not
so
much
as
know
me
;
they
have
hear
much
of
me
indeed
,
and
often
expect
me
there
,
but
I
always
get
off
,
though
many
time
in
the
extremest
danger
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
great
danger
I
be
now
in
,
be
that
I
be
too
well
known
among
the
trade
,
and
some
of
them
,
whose
hatred
be
owe
rather
to
envy
than
any
injury
I
have
do
them
,
begin
to
be
angry
that
I
should
always
escape
when
they
be
always
catch
and
hurry
to
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
they
that
give
me
the
name
of
Moll
Flanders
;
for
it
be
no
more
of
affinity
with
my
real
name
or
with
any
of
the
name
I
have
ever
go
by
,
than
black
be
of
kin
to
white
,
except
that
once
,
as
before
,
I
call
myself
Mrs.
Flanders
;
when
I
shelter
myself
in
the
Mint
;
but
that
these
rogue
never
know
,
nor
could
I
ever
learn
how
they
come
to
give
me
the
name
,
or
what
the
occasion
of
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
soon
inform
that
some
of
these
who
be
get
fast
into
Newgate
have
vow
to
impeach
me
;
and
as
I
know
that
two
or
three
of
them
be
but
too
able
to
do
it
,
I
be
under
a
great
concern
about
it
,
and
keep
within
door
for
a
good
while
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
governess
 
whom
I
always
make
partner
in
my
success
,
and
who
now
play
a
sure
game
with
me
,
for
that
she
have
a
share
of
the
gain
and
no
share
in
the
hazard
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
my
governess
be
something
impatient
of
my
lead
such
a
useless
,
unprofitable
life
,
as
she
call
it
;
and
she
lay
a
new
contrivance
for
my
go
abroad
,
and
this
be
to
dress
me
up
in
man
's
clothe
,
and
so
put
me
into
a
new
kind
of
practice
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
tall
and
personable
,
but
a
little
too
smooth
-
faced
for
a
man
;
however
,
I
seldom
go
abroad
but
in
the
night
,
it
do
well
enough
;
but
it
be
a
long
time
before
I
could
behave
in
my
new
clothe
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
as
to
my
craft
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
be
so
nimble
,
so
ready
,
so
dexterous
at
these
thing
in
a
dress
so
contrary
to
nature
;
and
I
do
everything
clumsily
,
so
I
have
neither
the
success
nor
the
easiness
of
escape
that
I
have
before
,
and
I
resolve
to
leave
it
off
;
but
that
resolution
be
confirm
soon
after
by
the
follow
accident
.
  
<EOS>
as
my
governess
disguise
me
like
a
man
,
so
she
join
me
with
a
man
,
a
young
fellow
that
be
nimble
enough
at
his
business
,
and
for
about
three
week
we
do
very
well
together
.
<EOS>
Our
principal
trade
be
watch
shopkeeper
'
counter
,
and
slip
off
any
kind
of
good
we
could
see
carelessly
lay
anywhere
,
and
we
make
several
good
bargain
,
as
we
call
them
,
at
this
work
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
we
keep
always
together
,
so
we
grow
very
intimate
,
yet
he
never
know
that
I
be
not
a
man
,
nay
,
though
I
several
time
go
home
with
him
to
his
lodging
,
accord
as
our
business
direct
,
and
four
or
five
time
lie
with
him
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
our
design
lie
another
way
,
and
it
be
absolutely
necessary
to
me
to
conceal
my
sex
from
him
,
as
appear
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
our
living
,
come
in
late
,
and
have
such
and
such
business
to
do
as
require
that
nobody
should
be
trust
with
the
come
into
our
lodging
,
be
such
as
make
it
impossible
to
me
to
refuse
lie
with
him
,
unless
I
would
have
own
my
sex
;
and
as
it
be
,
I
effectually
conceal
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
ill
,
and
my
good
fortune
<EOS>
,
soon
put
an
end
to
this
life
,
which
I
must
own
I
be
sick
of
too
,
on
several
other
account
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
make
several
prize
in
this
new
way
of
business
,
but
the
last
would
be
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
shop
in
a
certain
street
which
have
a
warehouse
behind
it
that
look
into
another
street
,
the
house
make
the
corner
of
the
turning
.
  
<EOS>
through
the
window
of
the
warehouse
we
see
,
lie
on
the
counter
or
showboard
,
which
be
just
before
it
,
five
piece
of
silk
,
besides
other
stuff
,
and
though
it
be
almost
dark
,
yet
the
people
,
be
busy
in
the
fore
-
shop
with
customer
,
have
not
have
time
to
shut
up
those
window
,
or
else
have
forget
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
the
young
fellow
be
so
overjoyed
with
,
that
he
could
not
restrain
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
lie
all
within
his
reach
he
say
,
and
he
swear
violently
to
me
that
he
would
have
it
,
if
he
break
down
the
house
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dissuade
him
a
little
,
but
see
there
be
no
remedy
;
so
he
run
rashly
upon
it
,
slip
out
a
square
of
the
sash
window
dexterously
enough
,
and
without
noise
,
and
get
out
four
piece
of
the
silk
,
and
come
with
them
towards
me
,
but
be
immediately
pursue
with
a
terrible
clutter
and
noise
.
<EOS>
We
be
stand
together
indeed
,
but
I
have
not
take
any
of
the
good
out
of
his
hand
,
when
I
say
to
him
hastily
,
"
You
be
undone
,
fly
,
for
God
's
sake
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
run
like
lightning
,
and
I
too
,
but
the
pursuit
be
hot
after
him
because
he
have
the
good
,
than
after
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
drop
two
of
the
piece
,
which
stop
them
a
little
,
but
the
crowd
increase
and
pursue
us
both
.
<EOS>
They
take
him
soon
after
with
the
other
two
piece
upon
him
,
and
then
the
rest
follow
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
run
for
it
and
get
into
my
governess
's
house
whither
<EOS>
some
quick
-
eyed
people
follow
me
to
warmly
as
to
fix
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
immediately
knock
,
at
the
door
,
by
which
I
get
time
to
throw
off
my
disguise
and
dress
me
in
my
own
clothe
;
besides
,
when
they
come
there
,
my
governess
,
who
have
her
tale
ready
,
keep
her
door
shut
,
and
call
out
to
them
and
tell
them
there
be
no
man
come
in
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
affirm
there
do
a
man
come
in
there
,
and
swear
they
would
break
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
governess
,
not
at
all
surprised
,
speak
calmly
to
them
,
tell
them
they
should
very
freely
come
and
search
her
house
,
if
they
should
bring
a
constable
,
and
let
in
none
but
such
as
the
constable
would
admit
,
for
it
be
unreasonable
to
let
in
a
whole
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
this
they
could
not
refuse
,
though
they
be
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
so
a
constable
be
fetch
immediately
,
and
she
very
freely
open
the
door
;
the
constable
keep
the
door
,
and
the
man
he
appoint
search
the
house
,
my
governess
go
with
them
from
room
to
room
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
my
room
she
call
to
me
,
and
say
aloud
,
"
cousin
,
pray
open
the
door
;
here
be
some
gentleman
that
must
come
and
look
into
your
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
girl
with
me
,
which
be
my
governess
's
grandchild
,
as
she
call
her
;
and
I
bade
her
open
the
door
,
and
there
sit
I
at
work
with
a
great
litter
of
thing
about
me
,
as
if
I
have
be
at
work
all
day
,
be
myself
quite
undressed
,
with
only
night
-
clothe
on
my
head
,
and
a
loose
morning
-
gown
wrap
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
governess
make
a
kind
of
excuse
for
their
disturb
me
,
tell
me
partly
the
occasion
of
it
,
and
that
she
have
no
remedy
but
to
open
the
door
to
them
,
and
let
them
satisfy
themselves
,
for
all
she
could
say
to
them
would
not
satisfy
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
still
,
and
bid
them
search
the
room
if
they
please
,
for
if
there
be
anybody
in
the
house
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
they
be
not
in
my
room
;
and
as
for
the
rest
of
the
house
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
that
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
understand
what
they
look
for
.
  
<EOS>
everything
look
so
innocent
and
to
honest
about
me
,
that
they
treat
me
civiller
than
I
expect
,
but
it
be
not
till
they
have
search
the
room
to
a
nicety
,
even
under
the
bed
,
in
the
bed
,
and
everywhere
else
where
it
be
possible
anything
could
be
hide
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
do
this
,
and
could
find
nothing
,
they
ask
my
pardon
for
trouble
me
,
and
go
down
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
thus
search
the
house
from
bottom
to
top
,
and
then
top
to
bottom
,
and
could
find
nothing
,
they
appease
the
mob
pretty
well
;
but
they
carry
my
governess
before
the
justice
.
 
<EOS>
two
man
swear
that
they
see
the
man
whom
they
pursue
go
into
her
house
.
 
<EOS>
My
governess
rattle
and
make
a
great
noise
that
her
house
should
be
insult
,
and
that
she
should
be
use
thus
for
nothing
;
that
if
a
man
do
come
in
,
he
may
go
out
again
presently
for
aught
she
know
,
for
she
be
ready
to
make
oath
that
no
man
have
be
within
her
door
all
that
day
as
she
know
of
(
<EOS>
and
that
be
very
true
indeed
)
;
that
be
may
be
indeed
that
as
she
be
abovestair
,
any
fellow
in
a
fright
may
find
the
door
open
and
run
in
for
shelter
when
he
be
pursue
,
but
that
she
know
nothing
of
it
;
and
if
it
have
be
so
,
he
certainly
go
out
again
,
perhaps
at
the
other
door
,
for
she
have
another
door
into
an
alley
,
and
so
have
make
his
escape
and
cheat
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
probable
enough
,
and
the
justice
satisfy
himself
with
give
her
an
oath
that
she
have
not
receive
or
admit
any
man
into
her
house
to
conceal
him
,
or
protect
or
hide
him
from
justice
.
 
<EOS>
this
oath
she
may
justly
take
,
and
do
so
,
and
so
she
be
dismiss
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
judge
what
a
fright
<EOS>
I
be
in
upon
this
occasion
,
and
it
be
impossible
for
my
governess
ever
to
bring
me
to
dress
in
that
disguise
again
;
for
,
as
I
tell
her
,
I
should
certainly
betray
myself
.
  
<EOS>
My
poor
partner
in
this
mischief
be
now
in
a
bad
case
,
for
he
be
carry
away
before
my
Lord
Mayor
,
and
by
his
worship
commit
to
Newgate
,
and
the
people
that
take
him
be
so
willing
,
as
well
as
able
,
to
prosecute
him
,
that
they
offer
themselves
to
enter
into
recognisance
to
appear
at
the
session
and
pursue
the
charge
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
get
his
indictment
defer
,
upon
promise
to
discover
his
accomplice
,
and
particularly
the
man
that
be
concern
with
him
in
his
robbery
;
and
he
fail
not
to
do
his
endeavour
,
for
he
give
in
my
name
,
whom
he
call
Gabriel
Spencer
,
which
be
the
name
I
go
by
to
him
;
and
here
appear
the
wisdom
of
my
conceal
my
name
and
sex
from
him
,
which
,
if
he
have
ever
know
I
have
be
undo
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
all
he
could
to
discover
this
Gabriel
Spencer
;
he
describe
me
,
he
discover
the
place
where
he
say
I
lodge
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
the
particular
that
he
could
of
my
dwelling
;
but
have
conceal
the
main
circumstance
of
my
sex
from
him
,
I
have
a
vast
advantage
,
and
he
never
could
hear
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
two
or
three
family
into
trouble
by
his
endeavouring
to
find
me
out
,
but
they
know
nothing
of
me
,
any
more
than
that
I
have
a
fellow
with
me
that
they
have
see
,
but
know
nothing
of
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
for
my
governess
,
though
she
be
the
mean
of
his
come
to
me
,
yet
it
be
do
at
second
-
hand
,
and
he
know
nothing
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
turn
to
his
disadvantage
;
for
have
promise
discovery
,
but
not
be
able
to
make
it
good
,
it
be
look
upon
as
trifle
with
the
justice
of
the
city
,
and
he
be
the
more
fiercely
pursue
by
the
shopkeeper
who
take
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
however
,
terribly
uneasy
all
this
while
,
and
that
I
may
be
quite
out
of
the
way
<EOS>
,
I
go
away
from
my
governess
be
for
a
while
;
but
not
know
wither
to
wander
,
I
take
a
maid
-
servant
with
me
,
and
take
the
stage
-
coach
to
Dunstable
,
to
my
old
landlord
and
landlady
,
where
I
have
live
so
handsomely
with
my
Lancashire
husband
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
tell
her
a
formal
story
,
that
I
expect
my
husband
every
day
from
Ireland
,
and
that
I
have
send
a
letter
to
him
that
I
would
meet
him
at
Dunstable
at
her
house
,
and
that
he
would
certainly
land
,
if
the
wind
be
fair
,
in
a
few
day
,
so
that
I
be
come
to
spend
a
few
day
with
them
till
he
should
come
,
for
he
be
either
come
post
,
or
in
the
West
Chester
coach
,
I
know
not
which
;
but
whichsoever
it
be
,
he
would
be
sure
to
come
to
that
house
to
meet
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlady
be
mighty
glad
to
see
me
,
and
my
landlord
make
such
a
stir
with
me
,
that
if
I
have
be
a
princess
I
could
not
have
be
better
use
,
and
here
I
may
have
be
welcome
a
month
or
two
if
I
have
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
business
be
of
another
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
uneasy
(
though
so
well
disguised
that
it
be
scarce
possible
to
detect
me
)
lest
<EOS>
this
fellow
should
somehow
or
other
find
me
out
;
and
though
he
could
not
charge
me
with
this
robbery
,
have
persuade
him
not
to
venture
,
and
have
also
do
nothing
in
it
myself
but
run
away
,
yet
he
may
have
charge
me
with
other
thing
,
and
have
buy
his
own
life
at
the
expense
of
mine
.
  
<EOS>
this
fill
me
with
horrible
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
recourse
,
no
friend
,
<EOS>
no
confidante
but
my
old
governess
,
and
I
know
no
remedy
but
to
put
my
life
in
her
hand
,
and
so
I
do
,
<EOS>
for
I
let
her
know
where
to
send
to
me
,
and
have
several
letter
from
her
while
I
stay
here
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
almost
scare
me
out
my
wit
but
at
last
she
send
me
the
joyful
news
that
he
be
hang
,
which
be
the
good
news
to
me
that
I
have
hear
a
great
while
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
stay
here
five
week
,
and
live
very
comfortably
indeed
(
the
secret
anxiety
of
my
mind
except
)
;
but
when
I
receive
this
letter
I
look
pleasantly
again
,
and
tell
my
landlady
that
I
have
receive
a
letter
from
my
spouse
in
Ireland
,
that
I
have
the
good
news
of
his
be
very
well
,
but
have
the
bad
news
that
his
business
would
not
permit
him
to
come
away
so
soon
as
he
expect
,
and
so
I
be
like
to
go
back
again
without
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlady
compliment
me
upon
the
good
news
however
,
that
I
have
hear
he
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
I
have
observe
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
have
not
be
so
pleasant
as
you
use
to
be
;
you
have
be
over
head
and
ear
in
care
for
him
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
"
say
the
good
woman
;
"
'
tis
easy
to
be
see
<EOS>
there
be
an
alteration
in
you
for
the
well
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
sorry
the
esquire
can
not
come
yet
,
"
say
my
landlord
;
"
I
should
have
be
heartily
glad
to
have
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
,
when
you
have
certain
news
of
his
come
,
you
will
take
a
step
hither
again
,
madam
,
"
say
he
;
"
you
shall
be
very
welcome
whenever
you
please
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
all
these
fine
compliment
we
part
,
and
I
come
merry
enough
to
London
,
and
find
my
governess
as
well
pleased
as
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
she
tell
me
she
would
never
recommend
any
partner
to
me
again
,
for
she
always
find
,
she
say
,
that
I
have
the
good
luck
when
I
venture
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
indeed
I
have
,
<EOS>
for
I
be
seldom
in
any
danger
when
I
be
by
myself
,
or
if
I
be
,
I
get
out
of
it
with
more
dexterity
than
when
I
be
entangle
with
the
dull
measure
of
other
people
,
who
have
perhaps
less
forecast
,
and
be
more
rash
and
impatient
than
I
;
for
though
I
have
as
much
courage
to
venture
as
any
of
them
,
yet
I
use
more
caution
before
I
undertake
a
thing
,
and
have
more
presence
of
mind
when
I
be
to
bring
myself
off
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
wonder
even
at
my
own
hardiness
another
way
,
that
when
all
my
companion
be
surprise
and
fall
so
suddenly
into
the
hand
of
justice
,
and
that
I
so
narrowly
escape
,
yet
I
could
not
all
this
while
enter
into
one
serious
resolution
to
leave
off
this
trade
,
and
especially
consider
that
I
be
now
very
far
from
be
poor
;
that
the
temptation
of
necessity
,
which
be
generally
the
introduction
of
all
such
wickedness
,
be
now
remove
;
for
I
have
near
#
#
#
#
500
by
me
in
ready
money
,
on
which
I
may
have
live
very
well
,
if
I
have
think
fit
to
have
retire
;
but
I
say
,
I
have
not
so
much
as
the
least
inclination
to
leave
off
;
no
,
not
so
much
as
I
have
before
when
I
have
but
#
#
#
#
200
beforehand
,
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
no
such
frightful
example
before
my
eye
as
these
be
.
 
<EOS>
from
hence
'
tis
evident
to
me
,
that
when
once
we
be
harden
in
crime
,
no
fear
can
affect
us
,
no
example
give
us
any
warning
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
one
comrade
whose
fate
go
very
near
me
for
a
good
while
,
though
I
wear
it
off
too
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
that
case
be
indeed
very
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
a
prize
of
a
piece
of
very
good
damask
in
a
mercer
's
shop
,
and
go
clear
off
myself
,
but
have
convey
the
piece
to
this
companion
of
mine
when
we
go
out
of
the
shop
,
and
she
go
one
way
<EOS>
and
I
go
another
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
be
long
out
of
the
shop
but
the
mercer
miss
his
piece
of
stuff
,
and
send
his
messenger
,
one
one
way
and
one
another
,
and
they
presently
seize
her
that
have
the
piece
,
with
the
damask
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
have
very
luckily
step
into
a
house
where
there
be
a
lace
chamber
,
up
one
pair
of
stair
,
and
have
the
satisfaction
,
or
the
terror
indeed
,
of
look
out
of
the
window
upon
the
noise
they
make
,
and
see
the
poor
creature
drag
away
in
triumph
to
the
justice
,
who
immediately
commit
her
to
Newgate
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
careful
to
attempt
nothing
in
the
lace
chamber
,
but
tumble
their
good
pretty
much
to
spend
time
;
then
buy
a
few
yard
of
edge
and
pay
for
it
,
and
come
away
very
sad
-
hearted
indeed
for
the
poor
woman
,
who
be
in
tribulation
for
what
I
only
have
steal
.
  
<EOS>
here
again
my
old
caution
stand
me
in
good
stead
;
namely
,
that
though
I
often
rob
with
these
people
,
yet
I
never
let
them
know
who
I
be
,
or
where
I
lodge
,
nor
could
they
ever
find
out
my
lodging
,
though
they
often
endeavour
to
watch
me
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
know
me
by
the
name
of
Moll
Flanders
,
though
even
some
of
them
rather
believe
I
be
she
than
know
me
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
My
name
be
public
among
them
indeed
,
but
how
to
find
me
out
they
know
not
,
nor
so
much
as
how
to
guess
at
my
quarter
,
whether
they
be
at
the
east
end
of
the
town
or
the
west
;
and
this
wariness
be
my
safety
upon
all
these
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
keep
close
a
great
while
upon
the
occasion
of
this
woman
's
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
if
I
should
do
anything
that
should
miscarry
,
and
should
be
carry
to
prison
,
she
would
be
there
and
ready
to
witness
against
me
,
and
perhaps
save
her
life
at
my
expense
.
 
<EOS>
I
consider
that
I
begin
to
be
very
well
know
by
name
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
though
they
do
not
know
my
face
,
and
that
if
I
should
fall
into
their
hand
,
I
should
be
treat
as
an
old
offender
;
and
for
this
reason
I
be
resolve
to
see
what
this
poor
creature
's
fate
should
be
before
I
stir
abroad
,
though
several
time
in
her
distress
I
convey
money
to
her
for
her
relief
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
she
come
to
her
trial
.
 
<EOS>
She
plead
she
do
not
steal
the
thing
,
but
that
one
Mrs.
Flanders
,
as
she
hear
her
call
(
for
she
do
not
know
her
)
,
give
the
bundle
to
her
after
they
come
out
of
the
shop
,
and
bade
her
carry
it
home
to
her
lodging
.
<EOS>
They
ask
her
where
this
Mrs.
Flanders
be
,
but
she
could
not
produce
her
,
neither
could
she
give
the
least
account
of
me
;
and
the
mercer
's
man
swear
positively
that
she
be
in
the
shop
when
the
good
be
steal
,
that
they
immediately
miss
them
,
and
pursue
her
,
and
find
them
upon
her
,
thereupon
the
jury
bring
her
in
guilty
;
but
the
Court
,
consider
that
she
be
really
not
the
person
that
steal
the
good
,
an
inferior
assistant
,
and
that
it
be
very
possible
<EOS>
she
could
not
find
out
this
Mrs.
Flanders
,
mean
me
,
though
it
would
save
her
life
,
which
indeed
be
true
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
consider
all
this
,
they
allow
her
to
be
transport
,
which
be
the
utmost
favour
she
could
obtain
,
only
that
the
Court
tell
her
that
if
she
could
in
the
meantime
produce
the
say
Mrs.
Flanders
,
they
would
intercede
for
her
pardon
;
that
be
to
say
,
if
she
could
find
me
out
,
and
hand
me
,
she
should
not
be
transport
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
take
care
to
make
impossible
to
her
,
and
so
she
be
ship
off
in
pursuance
of
her
sentence
a
little
while
after
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
repeat
it
again
,
that
the
fate
of
this
poor
woman
trouble
me
exceedingly
,
and
I
begin
to
be
very
pensive
,
know
that
I
be
really
the
instrument
of
her
disaster
;
but
the
preservation
of
my
own
life
,
which
be
so
evidently
in
danger
,
take
off
all
my
tenderness
;
and
see
that
she
be
not
put
to
death
,
I
be
very
easy
at
her
transportation
,
because
she
be
then
out
of
the
way
of
do
me
any
mischief
,
whatever
should
happen
.
  
<EOS>
the
disaster
of
this
woman
be
some
month
before
that
of
the
last
-
recite
story
,
and
be
indeed
partly
occasion
of
my
governess
propose
to
dress
me
up
in
man
's
clothe
,
that
I
may
go
about
unobserved
,
as
indeed
I
do
;
but
I
be
soon
tired
of
that
disguise
,
as
I
have
say
,
for
indeed
it
expose
me
to
too
many
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
easy
as
to
all
fear
of
witness
against
me
,
for
all
those
that
have
either
be
concern
with
me
,
or
that
know
me
by
the
name
of
Moll
Flanders
,
be
either
hang
or
transport
;
and
if
I
should
have
have
the
misfortune
to
be
take
,
I
may
call
myself
anything
else
,
as
well
as
Moll
Flanders
,
and
<EOS>
no
old
sin
could
be
place
into
my
account
;
so
I
begin
to
run
a
-
tick
again
with
the
more
freedom
,
and
several
successful
adventure
I
make
,
<EOS>
though
not
such
as
I
have
make
before
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
at
that
time
another
fire
happen
not
a
great
way
off
from
the
place
where
my
governess
live
,
and
I
make
an
attempt
there
,
as
before
,
but
as
I
be
not
soon
enough
before
the
crowd
of
people
come
in
,
and
could
not
get
to
the
house
I
aim
at
,
instead
of
a
prize
,
I
get
a
mischief
,
which
have
almost
put
a
period
 
to
my
life
and
all
my
wicked
doing
together
;
for
the
fire
be
very
furious
,
and
the
people
in
a
great
fright
in
remove
their
good
,
and
throw
them
out
of
window
,
a
wench
from
out
of
a
window
throw
a
feather
-
bed
just
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
the
bed
be
soft
<EOS>
,
it
break
no
bone
;
but
as
the
weight
be
great
,
and
make
great
by
the
fall
,
it
beat
me
down
,
and
lay
me
dead
for
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
the
people
concern
themselves
much
to
deliver
me
from
it
,
or
to
recover
me
at
all
;
but
<EOS>
I
lie
like
one
dead
and
neglect
a
good
while
,
till
somebody
go
to
remove
the
bed
out
of
the
way
,
help
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
wonder
the
people
in
the
house
have
not
throw
other
good
out
after
it
,
and
which
may
have
fall
upon
it
,
and
then
I
have
be
inevitably
kill
;
but
I
be
reserve
for
further
affliction
.
  
<EOS>
this
accident
,
however
,
spoil
my
market
for
that
time
,
and
I
come
home
to
my
governess
very
much
hurt
and
bruise
,
and
fright
to
the
last
degree
,
and
it
be
a
good
while
before
she
could
set
me
upon
my
foot
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
a
merry
time
of
the
year
,
and
Bartholomew
Fair
be
begin
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
make
any
walk
that
way
,
nor
be
the
common
part
of
the
fair
of
much
advantage
to
me
;
but
I
take
a
turn
this
year
into
the
cloister
,
and
among
the
rest
I
fall
into
one
of
the
raffling
shop
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
thing
of
no
great
consequence
to
me
,
nor
do
I
expect
to
make
much
of
it
;
but
there
come
a
gentleman
extremely
well
dressed
and
very
rich
,
and
as
'
tis
frequent
to
talk
to
everybody
in
those
shop
,
he
single
me
out
,
and
be
very
particular
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
first
he
tell
me
he
would
put
in
for
me
to
raffle
,
and
do
so
;
and
some
small
matter
come
to
his
lot
,
he
present
it
to
me
<EOS>
(
I
think
it
be
a
feather
muff
)
;
then
he
continue
to
keep
talk
to
me
with
a
more
than
common
appearance
of
respect
,
but
still
very
civil
,
and
much
like
a
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
He
hold
me
in
talk
so
long
,
till
at
last
he
draw
me
out
of
the
raffle
place
to
the
shop
-
door
,
and
then
to
a
walk
in
the
cloister
,
still
talk
of
a
thousand
thing
cursorily
without
anything
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
tell
me
that
,
without
compliment
,
he
be
charm
with
my
company
,
and
ask
me
if
I
durst
trust
myself
in
a
coach
with
him
;
he
tell
me
he
be
a
man
of
honour
,
and
would
not
offer
anything
to
me
unbecome
him
as
such
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
decline
it
a
while
,
but
suffer
myself
to
be
importune
a
little
,
and
then
yield
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
at
a
loss
in
my
thought
to
conclude
at
first
what
this
gentleman
design
;
but
I
find
afterwards
he
have
have
some
drink
in
his
head
,
and
that
he
be
not
very
unwilling
to
have
some
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
me
in
the
coach
to
the
Spring
Garden
,
at
Knightsbridge
,
where
we
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
he
treat
me
very
handsomely
;
but
I
find
he
drink
very
freely
.
<EOS>
He
press
me
also
to
drink
,
but
I
decline
it
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
keep
his
word
with
me
,
and
offer
me
nothing
amiss
.
 
<EOS>
We
come
away
in
the
coach
again
,
and
he
bring
me
into
the
street
,
and
by
this
time
it
be
near
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
and
he
stop
the
coach
at
a
house
<EOS>
where
,
it
seem
,
he
be
acquaint
,
and
where
they
make
no
scruple
to
show
us
upstairs
into
a
room
with
a
bed
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
I
seem
to
be
unwilling
to
go
up
,
but
after
a
few
word
I
yield
to
that
too
,
be
willing
to
see
the
end
of
it
,
and
in
hope
to
make
something
of
it
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
bed
,
etc
.
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
much
concerned
about
that
part
.
  
<EOS>
here
he
begin
to
be
a
little
free
with
me
than
he
have
promise
;
and
I
by
little
and
little
yielded
to
everything
,
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
he
do
what
he
please
with
me
;
I
need
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
while
he
drink
freely
too
,
and
about
one
in
the
morning
we
go
into
the
coach
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
air
and
the
shaking
of
the
coach
make
the
drink
he
have
get
more
up
in
his
head
than
it
be
before
,
and
he
grow
uneasy
in
the
coach
,
and
be
for
act
over
again
what
he
have
be
do
before
;
but
as
I
think
my
game
now
secure
,
I
resist
him
,
and
bring
him
to
be
a
little
still
,
which
have
not
last
five
minute
<EOS>
but
he
fall
fast
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
this
opportunity
to
search
him
to
a
nicety
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
a
gold
watch
,
with
a
silk
purse
of
gold
,
his
fine
full
-
bottom
periwig
and
silver
-
fringed
glove
,
his
sword
and
fine
snuff
-
box
,
and
gently
open
the
coach
door
,
stand
ready
to
jump
out
while
the
coach
be
go
on
;
but
the
coach
stop
in
the
narrow
street
beyond
Temple
Bar
to
let
another
coach
pass
<EOS>
,
I
get
softly
out
,
fasten
the
door
again
,
and
give
my
gentleman
and
the
coach
the
slip
both
together
,
and
never
hear
more
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
an
adventure
indeed
unlooke
for
,
and
perfectly
undesigned
by
me
;
though
I
be
not
so
past
the
merry
part
of
life
,
as
to
forget
how
to
behave
,
when
a
fop
so
blind
by
his
appetite
should
not
know
an
old
woman
from
a
young
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
indeed
look
so
old
as
I
be
by
ten
or
twelve
year
;
yet
I
be
not
a
young
wench
of
seventeen
,
and
it
be
easy
enough
to
be
distinguish
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
absurd
,
so
surfeiting
,
so
ridiculous
,
as
a
man
heat
by
wine
in
his
head
,
and
wicked
gust
in
his
inclination
together
;
he
be
in
the
possession
of
two
devil
at
once
,
and
can
no
more
govern
himself
by
his
reason
than
a
mill
can
grind
without
water
;
his
vice
trample
upon
all
that
be
in
him
that
have
any
good
in
it
,
if
any
such
thing
there
be
;
nay
,
his
very
sense
be
blind
by
its
own
rage
,
and
he
act
absurdity
even
in
his
view
;
such
a
drinking
more
,
when
he
be
drunk
already
;
pick
up
a
common
woman
,
without
regard
to
what
she
be
or
who
she
be
,
whether
sound
or
rotten
,
clean
or
unclean
,
whether
ugly
or
handsome
,
whether
old
or
young
,
and
so
blind
as
not
really
to
distinguish
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
man
be
bad
than
a
lunatic
;
prompt
by
his
vicious
,
corrupted
head
,
he
no
more
know
what
he
be
do
than
this
wretch
of
mine
know
when
I
pick
his
pocket
of
his
watch
and
his
purse
of
gold
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
man
of
whom
Solomon
say
,
"
They
go
like
an
ox
to
the
slaughter
,
till
a
dart
strike
through
their
liver
"
;
an
admirable
description
,
by
the
way
,
of
the
foul
disease
,
which
be
a
poisonous
deadly
contagion
mingle
with
the
blood
,
whose
centre
or
foundation
be
in
the
liver
;
from
whence
,
by
the
swift
circulation
of
the
whole
mass
,
that
dreadful
nauseous
plague
strike
immediately
through
his
liver
,
and
his
spirit
be
infect
,
his
vital
stab
through
as
with
a
dart
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
this
poor
unguarded
wretch
be
in
no
danger
from
me
,
though
I
be
greatly
apprehensive
at
first
of
what
danger
<EOS>
I
may
be
in
from
him
;
but
he
be
really
to
be
pity
in
one
respect
,
that
he
seem
to
be
a
good
sort
of
man
in
himself
;
a
gentleman
that
have
no
harm
in
his
design
;
a
man
of
sense
,
and
of
a
fine
behaviour
,
a
comely
handsome
person
,
a
sober
solid
countenance
,
a
charming
beautiful
face
,
and
everything
that
could
be
agreeable
;
only
have
unhappily
have
some
drink
the
night
before
,
have
not
be
in
bed
,
as
he
tell
me
when
we
be
together
;
be
hot
,
and
his
blood
fire
with
wine
,
and
in
that
condition
his
reason
,
as
it
be
asleep
,
have
give
him
up
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
my
business
be
his
money
,
and
what
I
could
make
of
him
;
and
after
that
,
if
I
could
have
find
out
any
way
to
have
do
it
,
I
would
have
send
him
safe
home
to
his
house
and
to
his
family
,
for
'
twas
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
he
have
an
honest
,
virtuous
wife
and
innocent
child
,
that
be
anxious
for
his
safety
,
and
would
have
be
glad
to
have
get
him
home
,
and
have
take
care
of
him
till
he
be
restore
to
himself
.
<EOS>
and
then
with
what
shame
and
regret
would
he
look
back
upon
himself
!
<EOS>
how
would
he
reproach
himself
with
associate
himself
with
a
whore
!
 
<EOS>
pick
up
in
the
bad
of
all
hole
,
the
cloister
,
among
the
dirt
and
filth
of
all
the
town
!
<EOS>
how
would
he
be
tremble
for
fear
he
have
get
the
pox
,
for
fear
a
dart
have
strike
through
his
liver
,
and
hate
himself
every
time
he
look
back
upon
the
madness
and
brutality
of
his
debauch
!
<EOS>
how
would
he
,
if
he
have
any
principle
of
honour
,
as
I
verily
believe
he
have
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
how
would
he
abhor
the
thought
of
give
any
ill
distemper
,
if
he
have
it
,
as
for
aught
he
know
he
may
,
to
his
modest
and
virtuous
wife
,
and
thereby
sow
the
contagion
in
the
life
-
blood
of
his
posterity
.
  
<EOS>
Would
such
gentleman
but
consider
the
contemptible
thought
which
the
very
woman
they
be
concern
with
,
in
such
case
as
these
,
have
of
them
,
it
would
be
a
surfeit
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
say
above
,
they
value
not
the
pleasure
,
they
be
raise
by
no
inclination
to
the
man
,
the
passive
jade
think
of
no
pleasure
but
the
money
;
and
when
he
be
,
as
it
be
,
drunk
in
the
ecstasy
of
his
wicked
pleasure
,
her
hand
be
in
his
pocket
search
for
what
she
can
find
there
,
and
of
which
he
can
no
more
be
sensible
in
the
moment
of
his
folly
that
he
can
forethink
of
it
when
he
go
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
a
woman
that
be
so
dexterous
with
a
fellow
,
who
indeed
deserve
no
well
usage
,
that
while
he
be
busy
with
her
another
way
,
convey
his
purse
with
twenty
guinea
in
it
out
of
his
fob
-
pocket
,
where
he
have
put
it
for
fear
of
her
,
and
put
another
purse
with
gild
counter
in
it
into
the
room
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
he
have
do
,
he
say
to
her
,
"
now
han't
you
pick
my
pocket
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
jest
with
him
,
and
tell
him
she
suppose
he
have
not
much
to
lose
;
he
put
his
hand
to
his
fob
,
and
with
his
finger
feel
that
his
purse
be
there
,
which
fully
satisfy
him
,
and
so
she
bring
off
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
a
trade
with
her
;
she
keep
a
sham
gold
watch
,
that
is
,
a
watch
of
silver
gilt
,
and
a
purse
of
counter
in
her
pocket
to
be
ready
on
all
such
occasion
,
and
I
doubt
not
practice
it
with
success
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
home
with
this
last
booty
to
my
governess
,
and
really
when
I
tell
her
the
story
,
it
so
affect
her
that
she
be
hardly
able
to
forbear
tear
,
to
know
how
such
a
gentleman
run
a
daily
risk
of
be
undo
every
time
a
glass
of
wine
get
into
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
purchase
I
get
,
and
how
entirely
I
strip
him
,
she
tell
me
it
please
her
wonderfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
child
,
"
say
she
,
"
the
usage
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
do
more
to
reform
him
than
all
the
sermon
that
ever
he
will
hear
in
his
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
if
the
remainder
of
the
story
be
true
,
so
it
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
the
next
day
she
be
wonderful
inquisitive
about
this
gentleman
;
the
description
I
have
give
her
of
him
,
his
dress
,
his
person
,
his
face
,
everything
concur
to
make
her
think
of
a
gentleman
whose
character
she
know
,
and
family
too
.
<EOS>
She
muse
a
while
,
and
I
go
still
on
with
the
particular
,
she
start
up
;
say
she
,
"
I
will
lay
#
#
#
#
100
<EOS>
I
know
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
do
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
would
not
have
him
expose
on
any
account
in
the
world
;
he
have
have
injury
enough
already
by
me
,
and
I
would
not
be
instrumental
to
do
him
any
more
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
will
do
him
no
injury
,
I
assure
you
,
but
you
may
let
me
satisfy
my
curiosity
a
little
,
for
if
it
be
he
,
I
warrant
you
<EOS>
I
find
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
startled
at
that
,
and
tell
her
,
with
an
apparent
concern
in
my
face
,
that
by
the
same
rule
he
may
find
me
out
,
and
then
I
be
undone
.
 
<EOS>
She
return
warmly
,
"
why
,
do
you
think
I
will
betray
you
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
"
say
she
,
"
not
for
all
he
be
worth
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
keep
your
counsel
in
bad
thing
than
these
;
sure
you
may
trust
me
in
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
say
no
more
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
She
lay
her
scheme
another
way
,
and
without
acquaint
me
of
it
,
but
she
be
resolve
to
find
it
out
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
go
to
a
certain
friend
of
her
who
be
acquaint
in
the
family
that
she
guess
at
,
and
tell
her
friend
she
have
some
extraordinary
business
with
such
a
gentleman
(
who
,
by
the
way
,
be
no
less
than
a
baronet
,
and
of
a
very
good
family
)
,
and
that
she
know
not
how
to
come
at
him
without
somebody
to
introduce
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
friend
promise
her
very
readily
to
do
it
,
and
accordingly
go
to
the
house
to
see
if
the
gentleman
be
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
she
come
to
my
governess
and
tell
her
that
Sir
#
#
#
#
 
be
at
home
,
but
that
he
have
meet
with
a
disaster
and
be
very
ill
,
and
there
be
no
speak
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
disaster
?
<EOS>
"
say
my
governess
hastily
,
as
if
she
be
surprised
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
her
friend
,
"
he
have
be
at
Hampstead
to
visit
a
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
and
as
he
come
back
again
he
be
set
upon
and
rob
;
and
have
get
a
little
drink
too
,
as
they
suppose
,
the
rogue
abuse
him
,
and
he
be
very
ill
.
"
<EOS>
"
rob
!
"
say
my
governess
,
"
and
what
do
they
take
from
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
her
friend
,
"
they
take
his
gold
watch
and
his
gold
snuff
-
box
,
his
fine
periwig
,
and
what
money
he
have
in
his
pocket
,
which
be
considerable
,
to
be
sure
,
for
Sir
#
#
#
#
 
never
go
without
a
purse
of
guinea
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
say
my
old
governess
,
jeer
,
"
I
warrant
you
he
have
get
drunk
now
and
get
a
whore
,
and
she
have
pick
his
pocket
,
and
so
he
come
home
to
his
wife
and
tell
her
he
have
be
rob
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
an
old
sham
;
a
thousand
such
trick
be
put
upon
the
poor
woman
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
!
"
say
her
friend
,
"
I
find
you
do
not
know
Sir
#
#
#
#
;
 
why
he
be
as
civil
a
gentleman
,
there
be
not
a
fine
man
,
nor
a
soberer
,
graver
,
modester
person
in
the
whole
city
;
he
abhor
such
thing
;
there
be
nobody
that
know
him
<EOS>
will
think
such
a
thing
of
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
my
governess
,
"
that
be
none
of
my
business
;
if
it
be
,
I
warrant
I
should
find
there
be
something
of
that
kind
in
it
<EOS>
;
your
modest
man
in
common
opinion
be
sometimes
no
well
than
other
people
,
only
they
keep
a
well
character
,
or
,
if
you
please
,
be
the
well
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
her
friend
,
"
I
can
assure
you
Sir
#
#
#
#
 
be
no
hypocrite
,
he
be
really
an
honest
,
sober
gentleman
,
and
he
have
certainly
be
rob
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
my
governess
,
"
it
may
be
he
have
;
it
be
no
business
of
mine
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
;
I
only
want
to
speak
with
him
;
my
business
be
of
another
nature
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
her
friend
,
"
let
your
business
be
of
what
nature
it
will
,
you
can
not
see
him
yet
,
for
he
be
not
fit
to
be
see
,
for
he
be
very
ill
,
and
bruise
very
much
,
"
 
"
ay
,
"
say
my
governess
,
"
nay
,
then
he
have
fall
into
bad
hand
,
to
be
sure
,
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
ask
gravely
,
"
pray
,
where
be
he
bruise
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
in
the
head
,
"
say
her
friend
,
"
and
one
of
his
hand
,
and
his
face
,
for
they
use
him
barbarously
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
poor
gentleman
,
"
say
my
governess
,
"
I
must
wait
,
then
,
till
he
recover
"
;
and
add
,
"
I
hope
it
will
not
be
long
,
for
I
want
very
much
to
speak
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
away
she
come
to
me
and
tell
me
this
story
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
find
out
your
fine
gentleman
,
and
a
fine
gentleman
he
be
,
"
say
she
;
"
but
,
mercy
on
him
,
he
be
in
a
sad
pickle
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
the
d####l
<EOS>
you
have
do
to
him
;
why
,
you
have
almost
kill
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
look
at
her
with
disorder
enough
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
kill
him
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
;
"
you
must
mistake
the
person
;
I
be
sure
I
do
nothing
to
him
;
he
be
very
well
when
I
leave
him
,
"
say
I
,
"
only
drunk
and
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
that
,
"
say
she
,
"
but
he
be
in
a
sad
pickle
now
"
;
and
so
she
tell
me
all
that
her
friend
have
say
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
he
fall
into
bad
hand
after
I
leave
him
,
for
I
be
sure
I
leave
him
safe
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
about
ten
day
after
,
or
a
little
more
,
my
governess
go
again
to
her
friend
,
to
introduce
her
to
this
gentleman
;
she
have
inquire
other
way
in
the
meantime
,
and
find
that
he
be
about
again
,
if
not
abroad
again
,
so
she
get
leave
to
speak
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
of
a
admirable
address
,
and
want
nobody
to
introduce
her
;
she
tell
her
tale
much
better
than
I
shall
be
able
to
tell
it
for
her
,
<EOS>
for
she
be
a
mistress
of
her
tongue
,
as
I
have
say
already
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
him
that
she
come
,
though
a
stranger
,
with
a
single
design
of
do
him
a
service
<EOS>
and
he
should
find
she
have
no
other
end
in
it
;
that
as
she
come
purely
on
so
friendly
an
account
,
she
beg
promise
from
him
,
<EOS>
that
if
he
do
not
accept
what
she
should
officiously
propose
he
would
not
take
it
ill
that
she
meddle
with
what
be
not
her
business
.
 
<EOS>
She
assure
him
that
as
what
she
have
to
say
be
a
secret
that
belong
to
him
only
,
so
whether
he
accept
her
offer
or
not
,
it
should
remain
a
secret
to
all
the
world
,
unless
he
expose
it
himself
;
nor
should
his
refuse
her
service
in
it
<EOS>
make
her
so
little
show
her
respect
as
to
do
him
the
least
injury
,
so
that
he
should
be
entirely
at
liberty
to
act
as
he
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
very
shy
at
first
,
and
say
he
know
nothing
that
relate
to
him
that
require
much
secrecy
;
that
he
have
never
do
any
man
any
wrong
,
and
care
not
what
anybody
may
say
of
him
;
that
it
be
no
part
of
his
character
to
be
unjust
to
anybody
,
nor
could
he
imagine
in
what
any
man
could
render
him
any
service
;
but
that
if
it
be
so
disintereste
a
service
as
she
say
,
he
could
not
take
it
ill
from
any
one
that
they
should
endeavour
to
serve
him
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
as
it
be
,
leave
her
a
liberty
either
to
tell
him
or
not
to
tell
,
as
she
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
She
find
him
so
perfectly
indifferent
,
that
she
be
almost
afraid
to
enter
into
the
point
with
him
;
but
,
however
,
after
some
other
circumlocution
she
tell
him
that
by
a
strange
and
unaccountable
accident
she
come
to
have
a
particular
knowledge
of
the
late
unhappy
adventure
he
have
fall
into
,
and
that
in
such
a
manner
,
that
there
be
nobody
in
the
world
but
herself
and
him
that
be
acquaint
with
it
,
no
,
not
the
very
person
that
be
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
a
little
angrily
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
adventure
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
"
say
she
,
"
of
your
being
rob
come
from
Knightbr
;
Hampstead
,
sir
,
<EOS>
I
should
say
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
surprised
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
I
be
able
to
tell
you
every
step
you
take
that
day
from
the
cloister
in
Smithfield
to
the
Spring
Garden
at
Knightsbridge
,
and
thence
to
the
#
#
#
#
 
in
the
Strand
,
and
how
you
be
leave
asleep
in
the
coach
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
let
not
this
surprise
you
,
for
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
do
not
come
to
make
a
booty
of
you
,
I
ask
nothing
of
you
,
and
I
assure
you
the
woman
that
be
with
you
know
nothing
who
you
be
,
and
never
shall
;
and
yet
perhaps
I
may
serve
you
further
still
,
for
I
do
not
come
barely
to
let
you
know
that
I
be
inform
of
these
thing
,
<EOS>
as
if
I
want
a
bribe
to
conceal
them
;
assure
yourself
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
whatever
you
think
fit
to
do
or
say
to
me
,
it
shall
be
all
a
secret
as
it
be
,
as
much
as
if
I
be
in
my
grave
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
astonish
at
her
discourse
,
and
say
gravely
to
her
,
"
Madam
,
you
be
a
stranger
to
me
,
but
it
be
very
unfortunate
that
you
should
be
let
into
the
secret
of
the
bad
action
of
my
life
,
and
a
thing
that
I
be
so
justly
ashamed
of
,
that
the
only
satisfaction
of
it
to
me
be
,
that
I
think
it
be
know
only
to
God
and
my
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
do
not
reckon
the
discovery
of
it
to
me
to
be
any
part
of
your
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
thing
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
you
be
surprised
into
,
and
perhaps
the
woman
use
some
art
to
prompt
you
to
it
;
however
,
you
will
never
find
any
just
cause
,
"
say
she
,
"
to
repent
that
I
come
to
hear
of
it
;
nor
can
your
own
mouth
be
more
silent
in
it
that
I
have
be
,
and
ever
shall
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
let
me
do
some
justice
to
the
woman
too
<EOS>
;
whoever
she
be
,
I
do
assure
you
she
prompt
me
to
nothing
,
she
rather
decline
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
own
folly
and
madness
that
bring
me
into
it
all
,
ay
,
and
bring
her
into
it
too
;
I
must
give
her
her
due
so
far
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
what
she
take
from
me
,
I
could
expect
no
less
from
her
in
the
condition
I
be
in
,
and
to
this
hour
I
know
not
whether
she
rob
me
or
the
coachman
;
if
she
do
it
,
I
forgive
her
,
and
I
think
all
gentleman
that
do
so
should
be
use
in
the
same
manner
;
but
I
be
more
concerned
for
some
other
thing
that
I
be
for
all
that
she
take
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
governess
now
begin
to
come
into
the
whole
matter
,
and
he
open
himself
freely
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
first
she
say
to
him
,
in
answer
to
what
he
have
say
about
me
,
"
I
be
glad
,
sir
,
you
be
so
just
to
the
person
that
you
be
with
<EOS>
;
I
assure
you
she
be
a
gentlewoman
,
and
no
woman
of
the
town
;
and
however
you
prevail
with
her
so
far
as
you
do
,
I
be
sure
'
tis
not
her
practice
.
 
<EOS>
You
run
a
great
venture
indeed
,
sir
;
but
if
that
be
any
part
of
your
care
,
I
be
persuade
you
may
be
perfectly
easy
,
for
I
dare
assure
you
no
man
have
touch
her
,
before
you
,
since
her
husband
,
and
he
have
be
dead
now
almost
eight
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
appear
that
this
be
his
grievance
,
and
that
he
be
in
a
very
great
fright
about
it
;
however
,
when
my
governess
say
this
to
him
,
he
appear
very
well
pleased
,
and
say
,
"
well
,
madam
,
to
be
plain
with
you
,
if
I
be
satisfied
of
that
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
so
much
value
what
I
lose
;
for
,
as
to
that
,
the
temptation
be
great
,
and
perhaps
she
be
poor
and
want
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
she
have
not
be
poor
,
sir
#
#
#
#
,
"
say
my
governess
,
"
I
assure
you
she
would
never
have
yield
to
you
;
and
as
her
poverty
first
prevail
with
her
to
let
you
do
as
you
do
,
so
the
same
poverty
prevail
with
her
to
pay
herself
at
last
,
when
she
see
you
be
in
such
a
condition
,
that
if
she
have
not
do
it
,
perhaps
the
next
coachman
may
have
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
much
good
<EOS>
may
it
do
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
all
the
gentleman
that
do
so
ought
to
be
use
in
the
same
manner
,
and
then
they
would
be
cautious
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
concern
about
it
,
but
on
the
score
which
you
hint
at
before
,
madam
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
he
enter
into
some
freedom
with
her
on
the
subject
of
what
pass
between
us
,
which
be
not
so
proper
for
a
woman
to
write
,
and
the
great
terror
that
be
upon
his
mind
with
relation
to
his
wife
,
<EOS>
for
fear
he
should
have
receive
any
injury
from
me
,
and
should
communicate
if
farther
;
and
ask
her
at
last
if
she
could
not
procure
him
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
governess
give
him
further
assurance
of
my
be
a
woman
clear
from
any
such
thing
,
and
that
he
be
as
entirely
safe
in
that
respect
as
he
be
with
his
own
lady
;
but
as
for
see
me
,
she
say
it
may
be
of
dangerous
consequence
;
but
,
however
,
that
she
would
talk
with
me
,
and
let
him
know
my
answer
,
use
at
the
same
time
some
argument
to
persuade
him
not
to
desire
it
,
and
that
it
could
be
of
no
service
to
him
,
see
she
hope
he
have
no
desire
to
renew
a
correspondence
with
me
,
and
that
on
my
account
it
be
a
kind
of
put
my
life
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
her
he
have
a
great
desire
to
see
me
,
that
he
would
give
her
any
assurance
that
be
in
his
power
,
not
to
take
any
advantage
of
me
,
and
that
in
the
first
place
he
would
give
me
a
general
release
from
all
demand
of
any
kind
.
 
<EOS>
She
insist
how
it
may
tend
to
a
further
divulge
the
secret
,
and
may
in
the
end
be
injurious
to
him
,
entreat
him
not
to
press
for
it
;
so
at
length
 
he
desist
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
some
discourse
upon
the
subject
of
the
thing
he
have
lose
,
and
he
seem
to
be
very
desirous
of
his
gold
watch
,
and
tell
her
if
she
could
procure
that
for
him
,
he
would
willingly
give
as
much
for
it
as
it
be
worth
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
him
she
would
endeavour
to
procure
it
for
him
,
and
leave
the
valuing
it
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
the
next
day
she
carry
the
watch
,
and
he
give
her
thirty
guinea
for
it
,
which
be
more
than
I
should
have
be
able
to
make
of
it
,
though
it
seem
it
cost
much
more
.
<EOS>
He
speak
something
of
his
periwig
,
which
it
seem
cost
him
threescore
guinea
,
and
his
snuff
-
box
,
and
in
a
few
day
more
she
carry
them
too
;
which
oblige
him
very
much
,
and
he
give
her
thirty
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
send
him
his
fine
sword
and
cane
gratis
,
and
demand
nothing
of
him
,
but
I
have
no
mind
to
see
him
,
unless
it
have
be
so
that
he
may
be
satisfied
<EOS>
I
know
who
he
be
,
which
he
be
not
willing
to
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
enter
into
a
long
talk
with
her
of
the
manner
how
she
come
to
know
all
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
She
form
a
long
tale
of
that
part
;
how
she
have
it
from
one
that
I
have
tell
the
whole
story
to
,
and
that
be
to
help
me
dispose
of
the
good
;
and
this
confidante
bring
the
thing
to
her
,
<EOS>
she
be
by
profession
a
pawnbroker
;
and
she
hear
of
his
worship
's
disaster
,
guess
at
the
thing
in
general
;
that
have
get
the
thing
into
her
hand
,
she
have
resolve
to
come
and
try
as
she
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
give
him
repeat
assurance
that
it
should
never
go
out
of
her
mouth
,
and
though
she
know
the
woman
very
well
,
yet
she
have
not
let
her
know
,
mean
me
,
anything
of
it
;
that
be
to
say
,
who
the
person
be
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
false
;
but
,
however
,
it
be
not
to
his
damage
,
for
I
never
open
my
mouth
of
it
to
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
many
thought
in
my
head
about
my
see
him
again
,
and
be
often
sorry
that
I
have
refuse
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
that
if
I
have
see
him
,
and
let
him
know
that
I
know
him
,
I
should
have
make
some
advantage
of
him
,
and
perhaps
have
have
some
maintenance
from
him
;
and
though
it
be
a
life
wicke
enough
,
yet
it
be
not
so
full
of
danger
as
this
I
be
engage
in
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
those
thought
wear
off
,
and
I
decline
see
him
again
,
for
that
time
;
but
my
governess
see
him
often
,
and
he
be
very
kind
to
her
,
give
her
something
almost
every
time
he
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
one
time
in
particular
she
find
him
very
merry
,
and
as
she
think
he
have
some
wine
in
his
head
,
and
he
press
her
again
very
earnestly
to
let
him
see
that
woman
that
,
as
he
say
,
have
bewitch
him
so
that
night
,
my
governess
,
who
be
from
the
beginning
for
my
see
him
,
tell
him
he
be
so
desirous
of
it
that
she
could
almost
yield
of
it
,
if
she
could
prevail
upon
me
;
add
that
if
he
would
please
to
come
to
her
house
in
the
evening
,
she
would
endeavour
it
,
upon
his
repeat
assurance
of
forget
what
be
past
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
she
come
to
me
,
and
tell
me
all
the
discourse
;
in
short
,
she
soon
bias
me
to
consent
,
in
a
case
which
I
have
some
regret
in
my
mind
for
decline
before
;
so
I
prepare
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
dress
me
to
all
the
advantage
possible
,
I
assure
you
,
and
for
the
first
time
use
a
little
art
;
I
say
for
the
first
time
,
for
I
have
never
yield
to
the
baseness
of
paint
before
,
have
always
have
vanity
enough
to
believe
I
have
no
need
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
hour
appoint
he
come
;
and
as
she
observe
before
,
so
it
be
plain
still
,
that
he
have
be
drink
,
though
very
far
from
what
we
call
be
in
drink
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
exceed
pleased
to
see
me
,
and
enter
into
a
long
discourse
with
me
upon
the
old
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
his
pardon
very
often
for
my
share
of
it
,
protest
I
have
not
any
such
design
when
first
I
meet
him
,
that
I
have
not
go
out
with
him
but
that
I
take
him
for
a
very
civil
gentleman
,
and
that
he
make
me
so
many
promise
of
offer
no
uncivility
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
allege
the
wine
he
drink
,
and
that
he
scarce
know
what
he
do
,
and
that
if
it
have
not
be
so
,
I
should
never
have
let
him
take
the
freedom
with
me
that
he
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
protest
to
me
that
he
never
touch
any
woman
but
me
since
he
be
married
to
his
wife
,
and
it
be
a
surprise
upon
him
;
compliment
me
upon
be
so
particularly
agreeable
to
him
,
and
the
like
;
and
talk
so
much
of
that
kind
,
till
I
find
he
have
talk
himself
almost
into
a
temper
to
do
the
same
thing
over
again
.
<EOS>
but
I
take
him
up
short
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
I
have
never
suffer
any
man
to
touch
me
since
my
husband
die
,
which
be
near
eight
year
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
believe
it
to
be
so
truly
;
and
add
that
madam
have
intimate
as
much
to
him
,
and
that
it
be
his
opinion
of
that
part
which
make
his
desire
to
see
me
again
;
and
that
since
he
have
once
break
in
upon
his
virtue
with
me
,
and
find
no
ill
consequence
,
he
could
be
safe
in
venture
there
again
;
and
so
,
in
short
,
it
go
on
to
what
I
expect
,
and
to
what
will
not
bear
relate
.
  
<EOS>
My
old
governess
have
foresee
it
,
as
well
as
I
,
and
therefore
lead
him
into
a
room
which
have
not
a
bed
in
it
,
and
yet
have
a
chamber
within
it
which
have
a
bed
<EOS>
,
whither
we
withdraw
for
the
rest
of
the
night
;
and
,
in
short
,
after
some
time
be
together
,
he
go
to
bed
,
and
lie
there
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
withdraw
,
but
come
again
undress
in
the
morning
,
before
it
be
day
,
and
lie
with
him
the
rest
of
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
you
see
,
have
commit
a
crime
once
be
a
sad
handle
to
the
committing
of
it
again
;
whereas
all
the
regret
and
reflection
wear
off
when
the
temptation
renew
itself
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
not
yield
to
see
him
again
,
the
corrupt
desire
in
him
have
wear
off
,
and
'
tis
very
probable
<EOS>
he
have
never
fall
into
it
with
anybody
else
,
as
I
really
believe
he
have
not
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
go
away
,
I
tell
him
I
hope
he
be
satisfied
he
have
not
be
rob
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
be
satisfied
in
that
point
,
and
could
trust
me
again
,
and
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
give
me
five
guinea
,
which
be
the
first
money
I
have
gain
that
way
for
many
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
several
visit
of
the
like
kind
from
him
,
but
he
never
come
into
a
settle
way
of
maintenance
,
which
be
what
I
would
have
best
pleased
with
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
indeed
,
he
ask
me
how
I
do
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
him
pretty
quick
,
that
I
assure
him
<EOS>
I
have
never
take
that
course
that
I
take
with
him
,
but
that
indeed
I
work
at
my
needle
,
and
could
just
maintain
myself
;
that
sometime
it
be
as
much
as
I
be
able
to
do
,
and
I
shift
hard
enough
.
  
<EOS>
He
seem
to
reflect
upon
himself
that
he
should
be
the
first
person
to
lead
me
into
that
,
which
he
assure
me
he
never
intend
to
do
himself
;
and
it
touch
him
a
little
,
he
say
,
that
he
should
be
the
cause
of
his
own
sin
and
mine
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
often
make
just
reflection
also
upon
the
crime
itself
,
and
upon
the
particular
circumstance
of
it
with
respect
to
himself
;
how
wine
introduce
the
inclination
how
the
devil
lead
him
to
the
place
,
and
find
out
an
object
to
tempt
him
,
and
he
make
the
moral
always
himself
.
  
<EOS>
when
these
thought
be
upon
him
he
would
go
away
,
and
perhaps
not
come
again
in
a
month
's
time
or
longer
;
but
then
as
the
serious
part
wear
off
,
the
lewd
part
would
wear
in
,
and
then
he
come
prepared
for
the
wicked
part
.
 
<EOS>
thus
we
live
for
some
time
;
think
he
do
not
keep
,
as
they
call
it
,
yet
he
never
fail
do
thing
that
be
handsome
,
and
sufficient
to
maintain
me
without
work
,
and
,
which
be
well
,
without
follow
my
old
trade
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
affair
have
its
end
too
;
for
after
about
a
year
,
I
find
that
he
do
not
come
so
often
as
usual
,
and
at
last
he
leave
if
off
altogether
without
any
dislike
to
bid
adieu
;
and
so
there
be
an
end
of
that
short
scene
of
life
,
which
add
no
great
store
to
me
,
only
to
make
more
work
for
repentance
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
during
this
interval
I
confine
myself
pretty
much
at
home
;
at
least
,
be
thus
provide
for
,
I
make
no
adventure
,
no
,
not
for
a
quarter
of
a
year
after
he
leave
me
;
but
then
find
the
fund
fail
,
and
be
loth
to
spend
upon
the
main
stock
,
I
begin
to
think
of
my
old
trade
,
and
to
look
abroad
into
the
street
again
;
and
my
first
step
be
lucky
enough
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
dress
myself
up
in
a
very
mean
habit
,
for
as
I
have
several
shape
to
appear
in
<EOS>
,
I
be
now
in
an
ordinary
stuff
-
gown
,
a
blue
apron
,
and
a
straw
hat
<EOS>
and
I
place
myself
at
the
door
of
the
Three
Cups
Inn
in
St.
John
Street
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
several
carrier
use
the
inn
,
and
the
stage
-
coach
for
Barnet
,
for
Totteridge
,
and
other
town
that
way
stand
always
in
the
street
in
the
evening
,
when
they
prepare
to
set
out
,
so
that
I
be
ready
for
anything
that
offer
,
for
either
one
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
meaning
be
this
;
people
come
frequently
with
bundle
and
small
parcel
to
those
inn
,
and
call
for
such
carrier
or
coach
as
they
want
,
to
carry
them
into
the
country
;
and
there
generally
attend
woman
,
porter
'
wife
or
daughter
,
ready
to
take
in
such
thing
for
their
respective
people
that
employ
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
very
oddly
that
I
be
stand
at
the
inn
gate
,
and
<EOS>
a
woman
that
have
stand
there
before
,
and
which
be
the
porter
's
wife
belong
to
the
Barnet
stage
-
coach
,
have
observe
me
,
ask
if
I
wait
for
any
of
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
<EOS>
yes
,
I
wait
for
my
mistress
,
that
be
come
to
go
to
Barnet
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
me
who
be
my
mistress
,
and
I
tell
her
any
madam
's
name
that
come
next
me
;
but
as
it
seem
,
I
happen
upon
a
name
,
a
family
of
which
name
live
at
Hadley
,
just
beyond
Barnet
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
to
her
,
or
she
to
me
,
a
good
while
;
but
by
and
by
,
somebody
call
her
at
a
door
a
little
way
off
,
she
desire
me
that
if
anybody
call
for
the
Barnet
coach
,
I
would
step
and
call
her
at
the
house
,
which
it
seem
be
an
alehouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
yes
,
very
readily
,
and
away
she
go
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
no
sooner
go
but
come
a
wench
and
a
child
,
puff
and
sweating
,
and
ask
for
the
Barnet
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
presently
,
"
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
belong
to
the
Barnet
coach
?
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sweetheart
,
"
say
I
;
"
what
do
ye
want
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
room
for
two
passenger
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
they
,
sweetheart
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
this
girl
,
pray
let
her
go
into
the
coach
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
I
will
go
and
fetch
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
make
haste
,
then
,
sweetheart
,
"
say
I
,
"
for
we
may
be
full
else
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
maid
have
a
great
bundle
under
her
arm
;
so
she
put
the
child
into
the
coach
,
and
I
say
,
"
You
have
best
put
your
bundle
into
the
coach
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
afraid
somebody
should
slip
it
away
from
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
give
to
me
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
I
will
take
care
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
,
then
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
be
sure
you
take
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
it
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
it
be
for
#
#
#
#
20
value
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
take
it
,
then
,
"
say
she
,
and
away
she
go
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
get
the
bundle
,
and
the
maid
be
out
of
sight
,
I
go
on
towards
the
alehouse
,
where
the
porter
's
wife
be
,
so
that
if
I
have
meet
her
,
I
have
then
only
be
go
to
give
her
the
bundle
,
and
to
call
her
to
her
business
,
as
if
I
be
go
away
,
and
could
stay
no
longer
;
but
as
I
do
not
meet
her
,
I
walk
away
,
and
turn
into
Charterhouse
Lane
,
then
cross
into
Batholomew
Close
,
so
into
Little
Britain
,
and
through
the
Bluecoat
Hospital
,
into
Newgate
Street
.
  
<EOS>
to
prevent
my
be
know
,
I
pull
off
my
blue
apron
,
and
wrap
the
bundle
in
it
,
which
before
be
make
up
in
a
piece
of
paint
calico
,
and
very
remarkable
;
I
also
wrap
up
my
straw
hat
in
it
,
and
so
put
the
bundle
upon
my
head
;
and
it
be
very
well
that
I
do
thus
,
for
come
through
the
Bluecoat
Hospital
,
who
should
I
meet
but
the
wench
that
have
give
me
the
bundle
to
hold
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
she
be
go
with
her
mistress
,
whom
she
have
be
go
to
fetch
,
to
the
Barnet
coach
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
she
be
in
haste
,
and
I
have
no
business
to
stop
her
;
so
away
she
go
,
and
I
bring
my
bundle
safe
home
to
my
governess
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
money
,
nor
plate
,
or
jewel
in
the
bundle
,
but
a
very
good
suit
of
indian
damask
,
a
gown
and
a
petticoat
,
a
laced
-
head
and
ruffle
of
very
good
Flanders
lace
,
and
some
linen
and
other
thing
,
such
as
I
know
very
well
the
value
of
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
indeed
my
own
invention
,
but
be
give
me
by
one
that
have
practise
it
with
success
,
and
my
governess
like
it
extremely
;
and
indeed
I
try
it
again
several
time
,
though
never
twice
near
the
same
place
;
for
the
next
time
I
try
it
in
White
Chapel
,
just
by
the
corner
of
Petticoat
Lane
,
where
the
coach
stand
that
go
out
to
Stratford
and
Bow
,
and
that
side
of
the
country
,
and
another
time
at
the
Flying
Horse
,
without
Bishopgate
,
where
the
Cheston
coach
then
lie
;
and
I
have
always
the
good
luck
to
come
off
with
some
booty
.
  
<EOS>
another
time
I
place
myself
at
a
warehouse
by
the
waterside
,
where
the
coast
vessel
from
the
north
come
,
such
as
from
Newcastle
-
upon
-
Tyne
,
Sunderland
,
and
other
place
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
the
warehouse
be
shut
,
come
a
young
fellow
with
a
letter
;
and
he
want
a
box
and
a
hamper
that
be
come
from
Newcastle
-
upon
-
Tyne
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
he
have
the
mark
of
it
;
so
he
show
me
the
letter
,
by
virtue
of
which
he
be
to
ask
for
it
,
and
which
give
an
account
of
the
content
,
the
box
be
full
of
linen
,
and
the
hamper
full
of
glass
ware
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
the
letter
,
and
take
care
to
see
the
name
,
and
the
mark
,
the
name
of
the
person
that
send
the
good
,
the
name
of
the
person
that
they
be
send
to
;
then
I
bid
the
messenger
come
in
the
morning
,
for
that
the
warehouse
-
keeper
would
not
be
there
any
more
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
away
go
I
,
and
get
material
in
a
public
house
,
I
write
a
letter
from
Mr.
John
Richardson
of
Newcastle
to
his
dear
cousin
Jemmy
Cole
,
in
London
,
with
an
account
that
he
send
by
such
a
vessel
(
for
I
remember
all
the
particular
to
a
title
)
,
so
many
piece
of
huckaback
linen
,
so
many
ell
of
Dutch
holland
and
the
like
,
in
a
box
,
and
a
hamper
of
flint
glass
from
Mr.
Henzill
's
glasshouse
;
and
that
the
box
be
mark
I.
C.
No
.
1
,
and
the
hamper
be
direct
by
a
label
on
the
cording
.
  
<EOS>
about
an
hour
after
,
I
come
to
the
warehouse
,
find
the
warehouse
-
keeper
,
and
have
the
good
deliver
me
without
any
scruple
;
the
value
of
the
linen
be
about
#
#
#
#
22
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
fill
up
this
whole
discourse
with
the
variety
of
such
adventure
,
which
daily
invention
direct
to
,
and
which
I
manage
with
the
utmost
dexterity
,
and
always
with
success
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
 
as
when
do
the
pitcher
come
safe
home
that
go
so
very
often
to
the
well
?
 
<EOS>
I
fall
into
some
small
broil
,
which
though
they
could
not
affect
me
fatally
,
yet
make
me
know
,
which
be
the
bad
thing
next
to
be
find
guilty
that
could
befall
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
take
up
the
disguise
of
a
widow
's
dress
;
it
be
without
any
real
design
in
view
,
but
only
wait
for
anything
that
may
offer
,
as
I
often
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
while
I
be
go
along
the
street
in
Covent
Garden
,
there
be
a
great
cry
of
"
stop
thief
!
 
<EOS>
stop
thief
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
some
artist
have
,
it
seem
,
put
a
trick
upon
a
shopkeeper
,
and
be
pursue
,
some
of
them
flee
one
way
,
and
some
another
;
and
one
of
them
be
,
they
say
,
dress
up
in
widow
's
weed
,
upon
which
the
mob
gather
about
me
,
and
some
say
I
be
the
person
,
other
say
no
.
<EOS>
immediately
come
the
mercer
's
journeyman
,
and
he
swear
aloud
<EOS>
I
be
the
person
,
and
so
seized
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
when
I
be
bring
back
by
the
mob
to
the
mercer
's
shop
,
the
master
of
the
house
say
freely
that
I
be
not
the
woman
that
be
in
his
shop
,
and
would
have
let
me
go
immediately
;
but
another
fellow
say
gravely
,
"
pray
stay
till
Mr.
#
#
#
#
"
 
(
mean
the
journeyman
)
"
come
back
,
for
he
know
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
they
keep
me
by
force
near
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
call
a
constable
,
and
he
stand
in
the
shop
as
my
jailer
;
and
in
talk
with
the
constable
I
inquire
where
he
live
,
and
what
trade
he
be
;
the
man
not
apprehend
in
the
least
what
happen
afterwards
,
readily
tell
me
his
name
,
and
trade
,
and
where
he
live
;
and
tell
me
as
a
jest
,
that
I
may
be
sure
to
hear
of
his
name
when
I
come
to
the
Old
Bailey
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
servant
likewise
use
me
saucily
,
and
have
much
ado
to
keep
their
hand
off
me
;
the
master
indeed
be
civiller
to
me
than
they
,
but
he
would
not
yet
let
me
go
,
though
he
own
<EOS>
he
could
not
say
I
be
in
his
shop
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
a
little
surly
with
him
,
and
tell
him
I
hope
he
would
not
take
it
ill
if
I
make
myself
amend
upon
him
in
a
more
legal
way
another
time
;
and
desire
I
may
send
for
friend
to
see
me
have
right
do
me
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
say
,
he
could
give
no
such
liberty
;
I
may
ask
it
when
I
come
before
the
justice
of
peace
;
and
see
I
threaten
him
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
in
the
meantime
,
and
would
lodge
me
safe
in
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
it
be
his
time
now
,
but
it
would
be
mine
by
and
by
,
and
govern
my
passion
as
well
as
I
be
able
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
speak
to
the
constable
to
call
me
a
porter
,
which
he
do
,
and
then
I
call
for
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
but
they
would
let
me
have
none
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
the
porter
his
name
,
and
where
he
live
,
and
the
poor
man
tell
it
me
very
willingly
.
<EOS>
I
bade
him
observe
and
remember
how
I
be
treat
there
;
that
he
see
I
be
detain
there
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
should
want
his
evidence
in
another
place
,
and
it
should
not
be
the
bad
for
him
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
the
porter
say
he
would
serve
me
with
all
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
madam
,
"
say
he
<EOS>
,
"
let
me
hear
them
refuse
to
let
you
go
,
then
I
may
be
able
to
speak
the
plainer
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
I
speak
aloud
to
the
master
of
the
shop
,
and
say
,
"
Sir
,
you
know
in
your
own
conscience
that
I
be
not
the
person
you
look
for
,
and
that
I
be
not
in
your
shop
before
,
therefore
I
demand
that
you
detain
me
here
no
longer
,
or
tell
me
the
reason
of
your
stop
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
grow
surly
upon
this
than
before
,
and
say
he
would
do
neither
till
he
think
fit
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
I
to
the
constable
and
to
the
porter
;
"
you
will
be
pleased
to
remember
this
,
gentleman
,
another
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
porter
say
,
"
yes
,
madam
"
;
and
the
constable
begin
not
to
like
it
,
and
would
have
persuade
the
mercer
to
dismiss
him
,
and
let
me
go
,
since
,
as
he
say
,
he
own
I
be
not
the
person
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
,
sir
,
"
say
the
mercer
to
him
tauntingly
,
"
be
you
a
justice
of
peace
or
a
constable
?
 
<EOS>
I
charge
you
with
her
;
pray
do
you
do
your
duty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
constable
tell
him
,
a
little
moved
,
but
very
handsomely
,
"
I
know
my
duty
,
and
what
I
be
,
sir
;
I
doubt
you
hardly
know
what
you
be
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
have
some
other
hard
word
,
and
in
the
meantime
the
journeyman
,
impudent
and
unmanly
to
the
last
degree
,
use
me
barbarously
,
and
one
of
them
,
the
same
that
first
seize
upon
me
,
pretend
he
would
search
me
,
and
begin
to
lay
hand
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
spit
in
his
face
,
call
out
to
the
constable
,
and
bade
him
to
take
notice
of
my
usage
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
pray
,
Mr.
Constable
,
"
say
I
,
"
ask
that
villain
's
name
,
"
point
to
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
constable
reprove
him
decently
,
tell
him
that
he
do
not
know
what
he
do
,
for
he
know
that
his
master
acknowledge
I
be
not
the
person
that
be
in
his
shop
;
"
and
,
"
say
the
constable
,
"
I
be
afraid
your
master
be
bring
himself
,
and
me
too
,
into
trouble
,
if
this
gentlewoman
come
to
prove
who
she
be
,
and
where
she
be
,
and
it
appear
that
she
be
not
the
woman
you
pretend
to
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
damn
her
,
"
say
the
fellow
again
,
with
a
impudent
,
harden
face
,
"
she
be
the
lady
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
;
I
will
swear
she
be
the
same
body
that
be
in
the
shop
,
and
that
I
give
the
piece
of
satin
that
be
lose
into
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
You
shall
hear
more
of
it
when
Mr.
William
and
Mr.
Anthony
(
those
 
be
other
journeyman
)
come
back
;
they
will
know
her
again
as
well
as
I.
"
  
just
as
the
insolent
rogue
be
talk
thus
to
the
constable
,
come
back
Mr.
William
and
Mr.
Anthony
,
as
he
call
them
,
and
a
great
rabble
with
them
,
bring
along
with
them
the
true
widow
that
I
be
pretend
to
be
;
and
they
come
sweat
and
blow
into
the
shop
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
triumph
,
drag
the
poor
creature
in
the
most
butcherly
manner
up
towards
their
master
,
who
be
in
the
back
shop
,
and
cry
out
aloud
,
"
here
be
the
widow
,
sir
;
we
have
catcher
her
at
last
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
do
ye
mean
by
that
?
"
say
the
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
we
have
her
already
;
there
she
sit
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
<EOS>
Mr.

#
#
#
,
"
say
he
,
"
can
swear
this
be
she
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
other
man
,
whom
they
call
Mr.
Anthony
,
reply
,
"
Mr.
#
#
#
#
 
may
say
what
he
will
,
and
swear
what
he
will
,
but
this
be
the
woman
,
and
there
be
the
remnant
of
satin
she
steal
;
I
take
it
out
of
her
clothe
with
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sit
still
now
,
and
begin
to
take
a
well
heart
,
but
smile
and
say
nothing
;
the
master
look
pale
;
the
constable
turn
about
and
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
'em
alone
,
Mr.
Constable
,
"
say
I
;
"
let
'em
go
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
case
be
plain
and
could
not
be
deny
,
so
the
constable
be
charge
with
the
right
thief
,
and
the
mercer
tell
me
very
civilly
he
be
sorry
for
the
mistake
,
and
hope
I
would
not
take
it
ill
;
that
they
have
so
many
thing
of
this
nature
put
upon
them
every
day
,
that
they
could
not
be
blame
for
be
very
sharp
in
do
themselves
justice
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
take
it
ill
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
;
"
how
can
I
take
it
well
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
dismiss
me
when
your
insolent
fellow
seize
on
me
it
the
street
,
and
bring
me
to
you
,
and
when
you
yourself
acknowledge
I
be
not
the
person
,
I
would
have
put
it
by
,
and
not
take
it
ill
,
because
of
the
many
ill
thing
I
believe
you
have
put
upon
you
daily
;
but
your
treatment
of
me
since
have
be
insufferable
,
and
especially
that
of
your
servant
;
I
must
and
will
have
reparation
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
parley
with
me
,
say
he
would
make
me
any
reasonable
satisfaction
,
and
would
fain
have
have
me
tell
him
what
it
be
I
expect
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
I
should
not
be
my
own
judge
,
the
law
should
decide
it
for
me
;
and
as
I
be
to
be
carry
before
a
magistrate
,
I
should
let
him
hear
there
what
I
have
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
there
be
no
occasion
to
go
before
the
justice
now
<EOS>
,
I
be
at
liberty
to
go
where
I
please
;
and
so
,
call
to
the
constable
,
tell
him
he
may
let
me
go
,
for
I
be
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
the
constable
say
calmly
to
him
,
"
sir
,
you
ask
me
just
now
if
I
know
whether
I
be
a
constable
or
justice
,
and
bade
<EOS>
me
do
my
duty
,
and
charge
me
with
this
gentlewoman
as
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
I
find
you
do
not
understand
what
be
my
duty
,
for
you
would
make
me
a
justice
indeed
;
but
I
must
tell
you
it
be
not
in
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
keep
a
prisoner
when
I
be
charge
with
him
,
but
'
tis
the
law
and
the
magistrate
alone
<EOS>
that
can
discharge
that
prisoner
;
therefore
'
tis
a
mistake
,
sir
;
I
must
carry
her
before
a
justice
now
,
whether
you
think
well
of
it
or
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
mercer
be
very
high
with
the
constable
at
first
;
but
the
constable
happen
to
be
not
a
hire
officer
,
but
a
good
,
substantial
kind
of
man
<EOS>
(
I
think
he
be
a
corn
-
handler
)
,
and
a
man
of
good
sense
,
stand
to
his
business
,
would
not
discharge
me
without
go
to
a
justice
of
the
peace
;
and
I
insist
upon
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
mercer
see
that
,
"
well
,
"
say
he
to
the
constable
,
"
you
may
carry
her
where
you
please
;
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
her

<EOS>
"
but
,
sir
,
"
say
the
constable
,
"
you
will
go
with
us
,
I
hope
,
for
'
tis
you
that
charge
me
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
I
,
"
say
the
mercer
;
"
I
tell
you
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
pray
,
sir
,
do
,
"
say
the
constable
;
"
I
desire
it
of
you
for
your
own
sake
,
for
the
justice
 
can
do
nothing
without
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Prithee
,
fellow
,
"
say
the
mercer
,
"
go
about
your
business
;
I
tell
you
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
the
gentlewoman
.
 
<EOS>
I
charge
you
in
the
king
's
name
to
dismiss
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
the
constable
,
"
I
find
you
do
not
know
what
it
be
to
be
constable
;
I
beg
of
<EOS>
you
do
not
oblige
me
to
be
rude
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
need
not
;
you
be
rude
enough
already
,
"
say
the
mercer
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
say
the
constable
,
"
I
be
not
rude
;
you
have
break
the
peace
in
bring
an
honest
woman
out
of
the
street
,
when
she
be
about
her
lawful
occasion
,
confine
her
in
your
shop
,
and
ill
-
use
her
here
by
your
servant
;
and
now
can
you
say
I
be
rude
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
civil
to
you
in
not
command
or
charge
you
in
the
king
's
name
to
go
with
me
,
and
charge
every
man
I
see
that
pass
your
door
to
aid
and
assist
me
in
carry
you
by
force
;
this
you
can
not
but
know
I
have
power
to
do
,
and
yet
I
forbear
it
,
and
once
more
entreat
you
to
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
well
,
he
would
not
for
all
this
,
and
give
the
constable
ill
language
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
constable
keep
his
temper
,
and
would
not
be
provoke
;
and
then
I
put
in
and
say
,
"
come
,
Mr.
Constable
,
let
him
alone
;
I
shall
find
way
enough
to
fetch
him
before
a
magistrate
,
I
do
not
fear
that
;
but
there
be
the
fellow
,
"
say
I
,
"
he
be
the
man
that
seize
on
me
as
I
be
innocently
go
along
the
street
,
and
you
be
a
witness
of
the
violence
with
me
since
;
<EOS>
give
me
leave
to
charge
you
with
him
,
and
carry
him
before
the
justice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
,
"
say
the
constable
;
and
turn
to
the
fellow
"
come
,
young
gentleman
,
"
say
he
to
the
journeyman
,
"
you
must
go
along
with
us
;
I
hope
you
be
not
above
the
constable
's
power
,
though
your
master
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
fellow
look
like
a
condemn
thief
,
and
hang
back
,
then
look
at
his
master
,
as
if
he
could
help
him
;
and
he
,
like
a
fool
,
encourage
the
fellow
to
be
rude
,
and
he
truly
resist
the
constable
,
and
push
him
back
with
a
good
force
when
he
go
to
lay
hold
on
him
,
at
which
the
constable
knock
him
down
,
and
call
out
for
help
;
and
immediately
the
shop
be
fill
with
people
,
and
the
constable
seize
the
master
and
man
,
and
all
his
servant
.
  
<EOS>
this
first
ill
consequence
of
this
fray
be
,
that
the
woman
they
have
take
,
who
be
really
the
thief
,
make
off
,
and
get
clear
away
in
the
crowd
;
and
two
other
that
they
have
stop
also
;
whether
they
be
really
guilty
or
not
,
that
I
can
say
nothing
to
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
some
of
his
neighbour
have
come
in
,
and
,
upon
inquiry
,
see
how
thing
go
,
have
endeavour
to
bring
the
hot
-
brained
mercer
to
his
sense
,
and
he
begin
to
be
convince
that
he
be
in
the
wrong
;
and
so
at
length
we
go
all
very
quietly
before
the
justice
,
with
a
mob
of
about
five
hundred
people
at
our
heel
;
and
all
the
way
I
go
I
could
hear
the
people
ask
what
be
the
matter
,
and
other
reply
and
say
,
a
mercer
have
stop
a
gentlewoman
instead
of
a
thief
,
and
have
afterwards
take
the
thief
,
and
now
the
gentlewoman
have
take
the
mercer
,
and
be
carry
him
before
the
justice
.
 
<EOS>
this
please
the
people
strangely
,
and
make
the
crowd
increase
,
and
they
cry
out
as
they
go
,
"
which
be
the
rogue
?
 
<EOS>
which
be
the
mercer
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
 
especially
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
then
when
they
see
him
they
cry
out
,
"
that
be
he
<EOS>
,
that
be
he
"
;
and
every
now
and
then
come
a
good
dab
of
dirt
at
him
;
and
thus
we
march
a
good
while
,
till
the
mercer
think
fit
to
desire
the
constable
to
call
a
coach
to
protect
himself
from
the
rabble
;
so
we
ride
the
rest
of
the
way
,
the
constable
and
I
,
and
the
mercer
and
his
man
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
justice
,
which
be
an
ancient
gentleman
in
Bloomsbury
,
the
constable
give
first
a
summary
account
of
the
matter
,
the
justice
bade
me
speak
,
and
tell
what
I
have
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
first
he
ask
my
name
,
which
I
be
very
loth
to
give
,
but
there
be
no
remedy
,
so
<EOS>
I
tell
him
my
name
be
Mary
Flanders
,
<EOS>
that
I
be
a
widow
,
my
husband
be
a
sea
captain
,
die
on
a
voyage
to
Virginia
;
and
some
other
circumstance
I
tell
which
he
could
never
contradict
,
and
that
I
lodge
at
present
in
town
with
such
a
person
,
name
my
governess
;
but
that
I
be
prepare
to
go
over
to
America
,
where
my
husband
's
effect
lie
,
and
that
I
be
go
that
day
to
buy
some
clothe
to
put
myself
into
second
mourning
,
but
have
not
yet
be
in
any
shop
,
when
that
fellow
,
point
to
the
mercer
's
journeyman
,
come
rush
upon
me
with
such
fury
as
very
much
fright
me
,
and
carry
me
back
to
his
master
's
shop
,
where
,
though
his
master
acknowledge
I
be
not
the
person
,
yet
he
would
not
dismiss
me
,
but
charge
a
constable
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
proceed
to
tell
how
the
journeyman
treat
me
;
how
they
would
not
suffer
me
to
send
for
any
of
my
friend
;
how
afterwards
they
find
the
real
thief
,
and
take
the
very
good
they
have
lose
upon
her
,
and
all
the
particular
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
constable
relate
his
case
:
 
his
dialogue
with
the
mercer
about
discharge
me
,
and
at
last
his
servant
's
refusing
to
go
with
him
,
when
he
have
charge
him
with
him
,
and
his
master
encourage
him
to
do
so
,
and
at
last
his
strike
the
constable
,
and
the
like
,
all
as
I
have
tell
it
already
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
then
hear
the
mercer
and
his
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
mercer
indeed
make
a
long
harangue
of
the
great
loss
they
have
daily
by
lifter
and
thief
;
that
it
be
easy
for
them
to
mistake
,
and
that
when
he
find
it
he
would
have
dismiss
me
,
etc
.
,
as
above
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
journeyman
,
he
have
very
little
to
say
,
but
that
he
pretend
other
of
the
servant
tell
him
that
I
be
really
the
person
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
the
justice
first
of
all
tell
me
very
courteously
I
be
discharge
;
that
he
be
very
sorry
that
the
mercer
's
man
should
in
his
eager
pursuit
have
so
little
discretion
as
to
take
up
an
innocent
person
for
a
guilty
person
;
that
if
he
have
not
be
so
unjust
as
to
detain
me
afterward
,
he
believe
I
would
have
forgive
the
first
affront
;
that
,
however
,
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
award
me
any
reparation
for
anything
,
other
than
by
openly
reprove
them
,
which
he
should
do
;
but
he
suppose
I
would
apply
to
such
method
as
the
law
direct
;
in
the
meantime
he
would
bind
him
over
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
breach
of
the
peace
commit
by
the
journeyman
,
he
tell
me
he
should
give
me
some
satisfaction
for
that
,
for
he
should
commit
him
to
Newgate
for
assault
the
constable
,
and
for
assault
me
also
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
he
send
the
fellow
to
Newgate
for
that
assault
,
and
his
master
give
bail
,
and
so
we
come
away
;
but
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
the
mob
wait
upon
them
both
,
as
they
come
out
,
halloo
and
throw
stone
and
dirt
at
the
coach
they
ride
in
;
and
so
I
come
home
to
my
governess
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
hustle
,
come
home
and
tell
my
governess
the
story
,
she
fall
a
-
laughing
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
be
you
merry
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
;
"
the
story
have
not
so
much
laughing
room
in
it
as
you
imagine
<EOS>
;
I
be
sure
I
have
have
a
great
deal
of
hurry
and
fright
too
,
with
a
pack
of
ugly
rogue
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Laugh
!
<EOS>
"
say
my
governess
;
"
I
laugh
,
child
,
to
see
what
a
lucky
creature
you
be
;
why
,
this
job
will
be
the
good
bargain
to
you
<EOS>
that
ever
you
make
in
your
life
,
if
you
manage
it
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
warrant
you
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
shall
make
the
mercer
pay
you
#
#
#
#
500
for
damage
,
besides
what
you
shall
get
out
of
the
journeyman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
other
thought
of
the
matter
than
she
have
;
and
especially
,
because
I
have
give
in
my
name
to
the
justice
of
peace
;
and
I
know
that
my
name
be
so
well
known
among
the
people
at
Hick
's
Hall
,
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
such
place
,
that
if
this
cause
come
to
be
try
openly
,
and
my
name
come
to
be
inquire
into
,
no
court
would
give
much
damage
,
for
the
reputation
of
a
person
of
such
a
character
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
oblige
to
begin
a
prosecution
in
form
,
and
accordingly
my
governess
find
me
out
a
very
creditable
sort
of
a
man
to
manage
it
,
be
an
attorney
of
very
good
business
,
and
of
a
good
reputation
,
and
she
be
certainly
in
the
right
of
this
;
for
have
she
employ
a
pettifog
hedge
solicitor
,
or
a
man
not
know
,
and
not
in
good
reputation
,
I
should
have
bring
it
to
but
little
.
  
<EOS>
I
meet
this
attorney
,
and
give
him
all
the
particular
at
large
,
as
they
be
recite
above
;
and
he
assure
me
it
be
a
case
,
as
he
say
,
that
would
very
well
support
itself
,
and
that
he
do
not
question
but
that
a
jury
would
give
very
considerable
damage
on
such
an
occasion
;
so
take
his
full
instruction
he
begin
the
prosecution
,
and
the
mercer
be
arrest
,
give
bail
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
his
give
bail
,
he
come
with
his
attorney
to
my
attorney
,
to
let
him
know
that
he
desire
to
accommodate
the
matter
;
that
it
be
all
carry
on
in
the
heat
of
an
unhappy
passion
;
that
his
client
,
mean
me
,
have
a
sharp
provoking
tongue
,
that
I
use
them
ill
,
gibe
at
them
,
and
jeer
them
,
even
while
they
believe
me
to
be
the
very
person
,
and
that
I
have
provoke
them
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
My
attorney
manage
as
well
on
my
side
;
make
them
believe
 
I
be
a
widow
of
fortune
,
that
I
be
able
to
do
myself
justice
,
and
have
great
friend
to
stand
by
me
too
,
who
have
all
make
me
promise
to
sue
to
the
utmost
,
and
that
if
it
cost
me
a
thousand
pound
I
would
be
sure
to
have
satisfaction
,
for
that
the
affront
I
have
receive
be
insufferable
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
they
bring
my
attorney
to
this
,
that
he
promise
he
would
not
blow
the
coal
,
that
if
I
incline
to
accommodation
,
he
would
not
hinder
me
,
and
that
he
would
rather
persuade
me
to
peace
than
to
war
;
for
which
they
tell
him
he
should
be
no
loser
;
all
which
he
tell
me
very
honestly
,
and
tell
me
that
if
they
offer
him
any
bribe
,
I
should
certainly
know
it
;
but
upon
the
whole
he
tell
me
very
honestly
that
if
I
would
take
his
opinion
,
he
would
advise
me
to
make
it
up
with
them
,
for
that
as
they
be
in
a
great
fright
,
and
be
desirous
above
all
thing
to
make
it
up
,
and
know
that
,
let
it
be
what
it
would
,
they
would
be
allot
to
bear
all
the
cost
of
the
suit
;
he
believe
they
would
give
me
freely
more
than
any
jury
or
court
of
justice
would
give
upon
a
trial
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
what
he
think
they
would
be
bring
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
could
not
tell
as
to
that
,
but
he
would
tell
me
more
when
I
see
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
,
they
come
again
to
know
if
he
have
talk
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
them
he
have
;
that
he
find
me
not
so
averse
to
an
accommodation
as
some
of
my
friend
be
,
who
resent
the
disgrace
offer
me
,
and
set
me
on
;
that
they
blow
the
coal
in
secret
,
prompt
me
to
revenge
,
or
do
myself
justice
,
as
they
call
it
;
so
that
he
could
not
tell
what
to
say
to
it
;
he
tell
them
he
would
do
his
endeavour
to
persuade
me
,
but
he
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
me
what
proposal
they
make
.
 
<EOS>
They
pretend
they
could
not
make
any
proposal
,
because
it
may
be
make
use
of
against
them
;
and
he
tell
them
,
that
by
the
same
rule
he
could
not
make
any
offer
,
for
that
may
be
plead
in
abatement
of
what
damage
a
jury
may
be
incline
to
give
.
<EOS>
however
,
after
some
discourse
and
mutual
promise
that
no
advantage
should
be
take
on
either
side
,
by
what
be
transact
then
or
at
any
other
of
those
meeting
,
they
come
to
a
kind
of
a
treaty
;
but
so
remote
,
and
so
wide
from
one
another
,
that
nothing
could
be
expect
from
it
;
for
my
attorney
demand
#
#
#
#
500
and
charge
,
and
they
offer
#
#
#
#
50
without
charge
;
so
they
break
off
,
and
the
mercer
propose
to
have
a
meeting
with
me
myself
;
and
my
attorney
agree
to
that
very
readily
.
  
<EOS>
My
attorney
give
me
notice
to
come
to
this
meeting
in
good
clothe
,
and
with
some
state
,
that
the
mercer
may
see
I
be
something
more
than
I
seem
to
be
that
time
they
have
me
.
<EOS>
accordingly
I
come
in
a
new
suit
of
second
mourning
,
accord
to
what
I
have
say
at
the
justice
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
myself
out
,
too
,
as
well
as
a
widow
's
dress
in
second
mourning
would
admit
;
my
governess
also
furnish
me
with
a
good
pearl
necklace
,
that
shut
in
behind
with
a
locket
of
diamond
,
which
she
have
in
pawn
;
and
I
have
a
very
good
figure
;
and
as
I
stay
till
I
be
sure
they
be
come
,
I
come
in
a
coach
to
the
door
,
with
my
maid
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
into
the
room
the
mercer
be
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
up
and
make
his
bow
,
which
I
take
a
little
notice
of
,
and
but
a
little
,
and
go
and
sit
down
where
my
own
attorney
have
point
to
me
to
sit
,
for
it
be
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
while
the
mercer
say
,
he
do
not
know
me
again
,
and
begin
to
make
some
compliment
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
believe
he
do
not
know
me
at
first
,
and
that
if
he
have
,
I
believe
he
would
not
have
treat
me
as
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
be
very
sorry
for
what
have
happen
,
and
that
it
be
to
testify
the
willingness
he
have
to
make
all
possible
reparation
that
he
have
appoint
this
meeting
;
that
he
hope
I
would
not
carry
thing
to
extremity
,
which
may
be
not
only
too
great
a
loss
to
him
,
but
may
be
the
ruin
of
his
business
and
shop
,
in
which
case
I
may
have
the
satisfaction
of
repay
an
injury
with
an
injury
ten
time
great
;
but
that
I
would
then
get
nothing
,
whereas
he
be
willing
to
do
me
any
justice
that
be
in
his
power
,
without
put
himself
or
me
to
the
trouble
or
charge
of
a
suit
at
law
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
glad
to
hear
him
talk
so
much
more
like
a
man
of
sense
than
he
do
before
;
that
it
be
true
,
acknowledgment
in
most
case
of
 
affront
<EOS>
be
count
reparation
sufficient
;
but
this
have
go
too
far
to
be
make
up
so
;
that
I
be
not
revengeful
,
nor
do
I
seek
his
ruin
,
or
any
man
's
else
,
but
that
all
my
friend
be
unanimous
not
to
let
me
so
far
neglect
my
character
as
to
adjust
a
thing
of
this
kind
without
a
sufficient
reparation
of
honour
;
that
to
be
take
up
for
a
thief
<EOS>
be
such
an
indignity
as
could
not
be
put
up
;
that
my
character
be
above
be
treat
so
by
any
that
know
me
,
but
because
in
my
condition
of
a
widow
I
have
be
for
some
time
careless
of
 
myself
,
and
negligent
of
myself
,
I
may
be
take
for
such
a
creature
,
but
that
for
the
particular
usage
I
have
from
him
afterwards
,
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
a
nd
<EOS>
then
I
repeat
all
as
before
;
it
be
so
provoking
I
have
scarce
patience
to
repeat
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
he
acknowledge
all
,
and
be
may
humble
indeed
;
he
make
proposal
very
handsome
;
he
come
up
to
#
#
#
#
100
and
to
pay
all
the
law
charge
,
and
add
that
he
would
make
me
a
present
of
a
very
good
suit
of
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
down
to
#
#
#
#
300
,
and
I
demand
that
I
should
publish
an
advertisement
of
the
particular
in
the
common
newspaper
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
clause
he
never
could
comply
with
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
he
come
up
,
by
good
management
of
my
attorney
,
to
#
#
#
#
150
and
a
suit
of
black
silk
clothe
;
and
there
I
agree
,
and
as
it
be
,
at
my
attorney
's
request
,
comply
with
it
<EOS>
,
he
pay
my
attorney
's
bill
and
charge
,
and
give
us
a
good
supper
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
receive
the
money
,
I
bring
my
governess
with
me
,
dress
like
an
old
duchess
,
and
a
gentleman
very
well
dressed
,
who
we
pretend
court
me
,
but
I
call
him
cousin
,
and
the
lawyer
be
only
to
hint
privately
to
him
that
his
gentleman
court
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
He
treat
us
handsomely
indeed
,
and
pay
the
money
cheerfully
enough
;
so
that
it
cost
him
#
#
#
#
200
in
all
,
or
rather
more
.
 
<EOS>
at
our
last
meeting
,
when
all
be
agree
,
the
case
of
the
journeyman
come
up
,
and
the
mercer
beg
very
hard
for
him
;
tell
me
he
be
a
man
that
have
keep
a
shop
of
his
own
,
and
be
in
good
business
,
have
a
wife
,
and
several
child
,
and
be
very
poor
;
that
he
have
nothing
to
make
satisfaction
with
,
but
he
should
come
to
beg
my
pardon
on
his
knee
,
if
I
desire
it
,
as
openly
as
I
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
spleen
at
the
saucy
rogue
,
nor
be
his
submission
anything
to
me
,
since
there
be
nothing
to
be
get
by
him
,
so
I
think
it
be
as
good
to
throw
that
in
generously
as
not
;
so
I
tell
him
I
do
not
desire
the
ruin
of
any
man
,
and
therefore
at
his
request
I
would
forgive
the
wretch
;
it
be
below
me
to
seek
any
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
at
supper
he
bring
the
poor
fellow
in
to
make
acknowledgment
,
which
he
would
have
do
with
as
much
mean
humility
as
his
offence
be
with
insult
haughtiness
and
pride
,
in
which
he
be
an
instance
of
a
complete
baseness
of
spirit
,
impious
,
cruel
,
and
relentless
when
uppermost
and
in
prosperity
,
abject
and
low
-
spirited
when
down
in
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
abate
his
cringe
,
tell
him
I
forgave
him
,
and
desire
he
may
withdraw
,
as
if
I
do
not
care
for
the
sight
of
him
,
though
I
have
forgive
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
in
good
circumstance
indeed
,
if
I
could
have
know
my
time
for
leave
off
,
and
my
governess
often
say
I
be
the
rich
of
the
trade
in
England
;
and
so
I
believe
I
be
,
for
I
have
#
#
#
#
700
by
me
in
money
,
besides
clothe
,
ring
,
some
plate
,
and
two
gold
watch
,
and
all
of
them
steal
,
for
I
have
innumerable
job
besides
these
I
have
mention
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
have
I
even
now
have
the
grace
of
 
repentance
,
I
have
still
leisure
to
have
look
back
upon
my
folly
,
and
have
make
some
reparation
;
but
the
satisfaction
I
be
to
make
for
the
public
mischief
I
have
do
be
yet
leave
behind
;
and
I
could
not
forbear
go
abroad
again
,
as
I
call
it
now
,
than
any
more
I
could
when
my
extremity
really
drive
me
out
for
bread
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
after
the
affair
with
the
mercer
be
make
up
,
that
I
go
out
in
an
equipage
quite
different
from
any
<EOS>
I
have
ever
appear
in
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
dress
myself
like
a
beggar
woman
,
in
the
coarse
and
most
despicable
rag
I
could
get
,
and
I
walk
about
peer
and
peep
into
every
door
and
window
<EOS>
I
come
near
;
and
indeed
I
be
in
such
a
plight
now
that
I
know
as
ill
how
to
behave
in
as
ever
<EOS>
I
do
in
any
.
 
<EOS>
I
naturally
abhor
dirt
and
rag
;
I
have
be
breed
up
tight
and
cleanly
,
and
could
be
no
other
,
whatever
condition
I
be
in
;
so
that
this
be
the
most
uneasy
disguise
to
me
that
ever
I
put
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
presently
to
myself
that
this
would
not
do
,
for
this
be
a
dress
that
everybody
be
shy
and
afraid
of
;
and
I
think
everybody
look
at
me
,
as
if
they
be
afraid
I
should
come
near
them
,
lest
I
should
take
something
from
them
,
or
afraid
to
come
near
me
,
lest
they
should
get
something
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wander
about
all
the
evening
the
first
time
I
go
out
,
and
make
nothing
of
it
,
but
come
home
again
wet
,
draggle
,
and
tired
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
go
out
again
the
next
night
,
and
then
I
meet
with
a
little
adventure
,
which
have
like
to
have
cost
me
dear
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
be
stand
near
a
tavern
door
,
there
come
a
gentleman
on
horseback
,
and
light
at
the
door
,
and
want
to
go
into
the
tavern
,
he
call
one
of
the
drawer
to
hold
his
horse
.
 
<EOS>
He
stay
pretty
long
in
the
tavern
,
and
the
drawer
hear
his
master
call
,
and
think
he
would
be
angry
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
see
me
stand
by
him
,
he
call
to
me
,
"
<EOS>
here
,
woman
,
"
say
he
,
"
hold
this
horse
a
while
,
till
I
go
in
;
if
the
gentleman
come
,
he
will
give
you
something
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
and
take
the
horse
,
and
walk
off
with
him
very
soberly
,
and
carry
him
to
my
governess
.
  
<EOS>
this
have
be
a
booty
to
those
that
have
understand
it
;
but
never
be
poor
thief
more
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
anything
that
be
steal
;
for
when
I
come
home
,
my
governess
be
quite
confound
,
and
what
to
do
with
the
creature
,
we
neither
of
us
know
.
 
<EOS>
to
send
him
to
a
stable
be
do
nothing
,
for
it
be
certain
that
public
notice
would
be
give
in
the
Gazette
,
and
the
horse
describe
,
so
that
we
durst
not
go
to
fetch
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
remedy
we
have
for
this
unlucky
adventure
be
to
go
and
set
up
the
horse
at
an
inn
,
and
send
a
note
by
a
porter
to
the
tavern
,
that
the
gentleman
's
horse
that
be
lose
such
a
time
be
leave
at
such
an
inn
,
and
that
he
may
be
have
there
;
that
the
poor
woman
that
hold
him
,
have
lead
him
about
the
street
,
not
be
able
to
lead
him
back
again
,
<EOS>
have
leave
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
have
wait
till
the
owner
have
publish
and
offer
a
reward
,
but
we
do
not
care
to
venture
the
receive
the
reward
.
  
<EOS>
so
this
be
a
robbery
and
no
robbery
,
for
little
be
lose
by
it
,
and
nothing
be
get
by
it
,
and
I
be
quite
sick
of
go
out
in
a
beggar
's
dress
;
it
do
not
answer
at
all
,
and
besides
,
I
think
it
be
ominous
and
threatening
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
in
this
disguise
,
I
fall
in
with
a
parcel
of
folk
of
a
bad
kind
than
any
I
ever
sort
with
,
and
I
see
a
little
into
their
way
too
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
coiner
of
money
,
and
they
make
some
very
good
offer
to
me
,
as
to
profit
;
but
the
part
they
would
have
have
me
have
embark
in
be
the
most
dangerous
part
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
that
of
the
very
work
the
die
,
as
they
call
it
,
which
,
have
I
be
take
,
have
be
certain
death
,
and
that
at
a
stake
 
I
say
,
to
be
burn
to
death
at
a
stake
;
so
that
though
I
be
to
appearance
but
a
beggar
,
and
they
promise
mountain
of
gold
and
silver
to
me
to
engage
,
yet
it
would
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
if
I
have
be
really
a
beggar
,
or
have
be
desperate
as
when
I
begin
,
I
may
perhaps
have
close
with
it
;
for
what
care
they
to
die
that
can
not
tell
how
to
live
?
 
<EOS>
but
at
present
this
be
not
my
condition
,
at
least
I
be
for
no
such
terrible
risk
as
those
;
besides
,
the
very
thought
of
be
burn
at
a
stake
strike
terror
into
my
very
soul
,
chill
my
blood
,
and
give
me
the
vapour
to
such
a
degree
,
as
I
could
not
think
of
it
without
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
this
put
an
end
to
my
disguise
too
,
for
as
I
do
not
like
the
proposal
,
so
I
do
not
tell
them
so
,
but
seem
to
relish
it
,
and
promise
to
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
durst
see
them
no
more
;
for
if
I
have
see
them
,
and
not
comply
,
though
I
have
decline
it
with
the
great
assurance
of
secrecy
in
the
world
,
they
would
have
go
near
to
have
murder
me
,
to
make
sure
work
,
and
make
themselves
easy
,
as
they
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
kind
of
easiness
that
be
,
they
may
best
judge
that
understand
how
easy
man
be
that
can
murder
people
to
prevent
danger
.
  
<EOS>
this
and
horse
-
steal
be
thing
quite
out
of
my
way
,
and
I
may
easily
resolve
I
would
have
to
more
to
say
to
them
;
my
business
seem
to
lie
another
way
,
and
though
it
have
hazard
enough
in
it
too
,
yet
it
be
more
suitable
to
me
,
and
what
have
more
of
art
in
it
,
and
more
room
to
escape
,
and
more
chance
for
a
-
come
off
if
a
surprise
should
happen
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
several
proposal
make
also
to
me
about
that
time
,
to
come
into
a
gang
of
house
-
breaker
;
but
that
be
a
thing
I
have
no
mind
to
venture
at
neither
,
any
more
than
I
have
at
the
coin
trade
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
to
go
along
with
two
man
and
a
woman
<EOS>
,
that
make
it
their
business
to
get
into
house
by
stratagem
,
and
with
them
I
be
willing
enough
to
venture
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
three
of
them
already
,
and
they
do
not
care
to
part
,
nor
I
to
have
too
many
in
a
gang
,
so
I
do
not
close
with
them
,
but
decline
them
,
and
they
pay
dear
for
their
next
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
length
I
meet
with
a
woman
that
have
often
tell
me
what
adventure
she
have
make
,
and
with
success
,
at
the
waterside
,
and
I
close
with
her
,
and
we
drive
on
our
business
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
we
come
among
some
dutch
people
at
St.
Catherine
's
,
where
we
go
on
pretence
to
buy
good
that
be
privately
get
on
shore
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
two
or
three
time
in
a
house
where
we
see
a
good
quantity
of
prohibit
good
,
and
my
companion
once
bring
away
three
piece
of
dutch
black
silk
that
turn
to
good
account
,
and
I
have
my
share
of
it
;
but
in
all
the
journey
I
make
by
myself
,
I
could
not
get
an
opportunity
to
do
anything
,
so
I
lay
it
aside
,
for
I
have
be
so
often
,
that
they
begin
to
suspect
something
,
and
be
so
shy
,
that
I
see
nothing
be
to
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
this
baulk
me
a
little
,
and
I
resolve
to
push
at
something
or
other
,
for
I
be
not
use
to
come
back
so
often
without
purchase
;
so
the
next
day
I
dress
myself
up
fine
,
and
take
a
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
through
the
Exchange
in
the
Strand
,
but
have
no
notion
of
find
anything
to
do
there
,
when
on
a
sudden
I
see
a
great
cluttering
in
the
place
,
and
all
the
people
,
shopkeeper
as
well
as
other
,
stand
up
and
stare
;
and
what
should
it
be
<EOS>
but
some
great
duchess
come
into
the
Exchange
,
and
they
say
the
queen
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
myself
close
up
to
a
shop
-
side
with
my
back
to
the
counter
,
as
if
to
let
the
crowd
pass
by
,
when
keep
my
eye
upon
a
parcel
of
lace
which
the
shopkeeper
be
show
to
some
lady
that
stand
by
me
,
the
shopkeeper
and
her
maid
be
so
take
up
with
look
to
see
who
be
come
,
and
what
shop
they
would
go
to
,
that
I
find
mean
to
slip
a
paper
of
lace
into
my
pocket
and
come
clear
off
with
it
;
so
the
lady
-
milliner
pay
dear
enough
for
her
gape
after
the
queen
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
off
from
the
shop
,
as
if
drive
along
by
the
throng
,
and
mingle
myself
with
the
crowd
,
go
out
at
the
other
door
of
the
Exchange
,
and
so
get
away
before
they
miss
their
lace
;
and
because
I
would
not
be
follow
,
I
call
a
coach
and
shut
myself
up
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
scarce
shut
the
coach
door
up
,
but
I
see
the
milliner
's
maid
and
five
or
six
more
come
run
out
into
the
street
,
and
cry
out
as
if
they
be
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
cry
"
stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
because
nobody
run
away
,
but
I
could
hear
the
word
"
rob
,
"
and
"
lace
,
"
two
or
three
time
,
and
see
the
wench
wring
her
hand
,
and
run
stare
to
and
again
,
like
one
scared
.
 
<EOS>
the
coachman
that
have
take
me
up
be
get
up
into
the
box
,
but
be
not
quite
up
,
so
that
the
horse
have
not
begin
to
move
;
so
that
I
be
terrible
uneasy
,
and
<EOS>
I
take
the
packet
of
lace
and
lay
it
ready
to
have
drop
it
out
at
the
flap
of
the
coach
,
which
open
before
,
just
behind
the
coachman
;
but
to
my
great
satisfaction
,
in
less
than
a
minute
<EOS>
the
coach
begin
to
move
,
that
be
to
say
,
as
soon
as
the
coachman
have
get
up
and
speak
to
his
horse
;
so
he
drive
away
without
any
interruption
,
and
I
bring
off
my
purchase
,
which
be
work
near
#
#
#
#
20
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
dress
up
again
,
but
in
quite
different
clothe
,
and
walk
the
same
way
again
,
but
nothing
offer
till
I
come
into
St.
James
's
Park
,
where
I
see
abundance
of
fine
lady
in
the
Park
,
walk
in
the
Mall
,
and
among
the
rest
there
be
a
little
miss
,
a
young
lady
of
about
twelve
or
thirteen
year
old
,
and
she
have
a
sister
,
as
I
suppose
it
be
,
with
her
,
that
may
be
about
nine
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
the
big
have
a
fine
gold
watch
on
,
and
a
good
necklace
of
pearl
,
and
they
have
a
footman
in
livery
with
them
;
but
as
it
be
not
usual
for
the
footman
to
go
behind
the
lady
in
the
Mall
,
so
<EOS>
I
observe
the
footman
stop
at
their
go
into
the
Mall
,
and
the
big
of
the
sister
speak
to
him
,
which
I
perceive
be
to
bid
him
<EOS>
be
just
there
when
they
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
hear
her
dismiss
the
footman
,
I
step
up
to
him
and
ask
him
,
what
little
lady
that
be
?
<EOS>
and
hold
a
little
chat
with
him
about
what
a
pretty
child
<EOS>
it
be
with
her
,
and
how
genteel
and
well
-
carriage
the
lady
,
the
eld
,
would
be
:
 
how
womanish
,
and
how
grave
;
and
<EOS>
the
fool
of
a
fellow
tell
me
presently
who
she
be
;
that
she
be
Sir
Thomas
#
#
#
#
"
s
eld
daughter
,
of
Essex
,
and
that
she
be
a
great
fortune
;
that
her
mother
be
not
come
to
town
yet
;
but
she
be
with
Sir
William
#
#
#
#
"
s
lady
,
of
Suffolk
,
at
her
lodging
in
Suffolk
Street
,
and
a
great
deal
more
;
that
they
have
a
maid
and
a
woman
to
wait
on
them
,
besides
Sir
Thomas
's
coach
,
the
coachman
,
and
himself
;
and
that
young
lady
be
governess
to
the
whole
family
,
as
well
here
as
at
home
too
;
and
,
in
short
,
tell
me
abundance
of
thing
enough
for
my
business
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
dressed
,
and
have
my
gold
watch
as
well
as
she
;
so
I
leave
the
footman
,
and
I
put
myself
in
a
rank
with
this
young
lady
,
have
stay
till
she
have
take
one
double
turn
in
the
Mall
,
and
be
go
forward
again
;
by
and
by
I
salute
her
by
her
name
,
with
the
title
of
Lady
Betty
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
her
when
she
hear
from
her
father
;
when
my
lady
her
mother
would
be
in
town
,
and
how
she
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
talk
so
familiarly
to
her
of
her
whole
family
that
she
could
not
suspect
but
that
I
know
them
all
intimately
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
her
why
she
would
come
abroad
without
Mrs.
Chime
with
her
(
that
be
the
name
of
her
woman
)
to
take
of
Mrs.
Judith
<EOS>
,
that
be
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
enter
into
a
long
chat
with
her
about
her
sister
,
what
a
fine
little
lady
she
be
,
and
ask
her
if
she
have
learn
French
,
and
a
thousand
such
little
thing
to
entertain
her
,
when
on
a
sudden
we
see
the
guard
come
,
and
the
crowd
run
to
see
the
king
go
by
to
the
Parliament
House
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
run
all
to
the
side
of
the
Mall
,
and
I
help
my
lady
to
stand
upon
the
edge
of
the
board
on
the
side
of
the
Mall
,
that
she
may
be
high
enough
to
see
;
and
take
the
little
one
and
lift
her
quite
up
;
during
which
,
I
take
care
to
convey
the
gold
watch
so
clean
away
from
the
Lady
Betty
,
that
she
never
feel
it
,
nor
miss
it
,
till
all
the
crowd
be
go
,
and
she
be
get
into
the
middle
of
the
Mall
among
the
other
lady
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
my
leave
of
her
in
the
very
crowd
,
and
say
to
her
,
as
if
in
haste
,
"
Dear
Lady
Betty
,
take
care
of
your
little
sister
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
the
crowd
do
as
it
be
thrust
me
away
from
her
,
and
that
I
be
oblige
unwillingly
to
take
my
leave
.
  
<EOS>
the
hurry
in
such
case
be
immediately
over
,
and
the
place
clear
as
soon
as
the
king
be
go
by
;
but
as
there
be
always
a
great
running
and
clutter
just
as
the
king
pass
,
so
have
drop
the
two
little
lady
,
and
do
my
business
with
them
without
any
miscarriage
,
I
keep
hurry
on
among
the
crowd
,
as
if
I
run
to
see
the
king
,
and
so
I
get
before
the
crowd
and
keep
so
<EOS>
till
I
come
to
the
end
of
the
Mall
,
when
the
king
go
on
towards
the
Horse
Guards
,
I
go
forward
to
the
passage
,
which
go
then
through
against
the
low
end
of
the
haymarket
,
and
there
I
bestow
a
coach
upon
myself
,
and
make
off
,
and
I
confess
I
have
not
yet
be
so
good
as
my
word
,
viz
.
<EOS>
to
go
and
visit
my
Lady
Betty
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
once
of
the
mind
to
venture
stay
with
Lady
Betty
till
she
miss
the
watch
,
and
so
have
make
a
great
outcry
about
it
with
her
,
and
have
get
her
into
the
coach
,
and
put
myself
in
the
coach
with
her
,
and
have
go
home
with
her
;
for
she
appear
so
fond
of
me
,
and
so
perfectly
deceive
by
my
so
readily
talk
to
her
of
all
her
relation
and
family
,
that
I
think
it
be
very
easy
to
push
the
thing
farther
,
and
to
have
get
at
least
the
necklace
of
pearl
;
but
when
I
consider
that
though
the
child
would
not
perhaps
have
suspect
me
,
other
people
may
,
and
that
if
I
be
search
I
should
be
discover
,
I
think
it
be
good
to
go
off
with
what
I
have
get
,
and
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
accidentally
afterwards
to
hear
,
that
when
the
young
lady
miss
her
watch
,
she
make
a
great
outcry
in
the
Park
,
and
send
her
footman
up
and
down
to
see
if
he
could
find
me
out
,
she
have
describe
me
so
perfectly
that
he
know
presently
that
it
be
the
same
person
that
have
stand
and
talk
so
long
with
him
,
and
ask
him
so
many
question
about
them
;
but
I
go
far
enough
out
of
their
reach
before
she
could
come
at
her
footman
to
tell
him
the
story
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
another
adventure
after
this
,
of
a
nature
different
from
all
I
have
be
concern
in
yet
,
and
this
be
at
a
gaming
-
house
near
Covent
Garden
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
several
people
go
in
and
out
;
and
I
stand
in
the
passage
a
good
while
with
another
woman
with
me
,
and
see
a
gentleman
go
up
that
seem
to
be
of
more
than
ordinary
fashion
,
I
say
to
him
,
"
Sir
,
pray
do
not
they
give
woman
leave
to
go
up
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
to
play
too
,
if
they
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
so
,
sir
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
and
with
that
he
say
he
would
introduce
me
if
I
have
a
mind
;
so
I
follow
him
to
the
door
,
and
he
look
in
,
"
there
,
madam
,
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
"
be
the
gamester
,
if
you
have
a
mind
to
venture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
look
in
and
say
to
my
comrade
aloud
,
"
here
be
nothing
but
man
;
I
will
not
venture
among
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
one
of
the
gentleman
cry
out
,
"
You
need
not
be
afraid
,
madam
,
<EOS>
here
be
none
but
fair
gamester
;
you
be
very
welcome
to
come
and
set
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
a
little
near
and
look
on
,
and
<EOS>
some
of
them
bring
me
a
chair
,
and
I
sit
down
and
see
the
box
and
dice
go
round
apace
;
then
I
say
to
my
comrade
,
"
the
gentleman
play
too
high
for
us
;
come
,
let
us
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
people
be
all
very
civil
,
and
one
gentleman
in
particular
encourage
me
,
and
say
,
"
come
,
madam
,
if
you
please
to
venture
,
<EOS>
if
you
dare
trust
me
,
I
will
answer
for
it
<EOS>
you
shall
have
nothing
put
upon
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
smile
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
the
gentleman
would
not
cheat
a
woman
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
still
I
decline
venture
,
though
I
pull
out
a
purse
with
money
in
it
,
that
they
may
see
I
do
not
want
money
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
sit
a
while
,
one
gentleman
say
to
me
,
jeer
,
"
come
,
madam
,
<EOS>
I
see
you
be
afraid
to
venture
for
yourself
;
I
always
have
good
luck
with
the
lady
<EOS>
,
you
shall
set
for
me
,
if
you
will
not
set
for
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
"
sir
,
I
should
be
very
loth
to
lose
your
money
,
"
though
I
add
,
"
I
be
pretty
lucky
too
;
but
the
gentleman
play
so
high
,
that
I
dare
not
indeed
venture
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
ten
guinea
,
madam
;
set
them
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
take
his
money
and
set
,
himself
look
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
run
out
nine
of
the
guinea
by
one
and
two
at
a
time
,
and
then
the
box
come
to
the
next
man
to
me
,
my
gentleman
give
me
ten
guinea
more
,
and
make
me
set
five
of
them
at
once
,
and
the
gentleman
who
have
the
box
throw
out
,
so
there
be
five
guinea
of
his
money
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
encourage
at
this
,
and
make
me
take
the
box
,
which
be
a
bold
venture
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
hold
the
box
so
long
that
I
have
gain
him
his
whole
money
,
and
have
a
good
handful
of
guinea
in
my
lap
,
and
which
be
the
well
luck
,
when
I
throw
out
,
I
throw
but
at
one
or
two
of
those
that
have
set
me
,
and
so
go
off
easy
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
come
this
length
,
I
offer
the
gentleman
all
the
gold
,
for
it
be
his
own
;
and
so
would
have
have
him
play
for
himself
,
pretend
I
do
not
understand
the
game
well
enough
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
,
and
say
if
I
have
but
good
luck
,
it
be
no
matter
whether
I
understand
the
game
or
no
<EOS>
;
but
I
should
not
leave
off
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
take
out
the
fifteen
guinea
that
he
have
put
in
at
first
,
and
bade
me
play
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
tell
them
to
see
how
much
I
have
get
,
but
he
say
,
"
no
,
no
,
do
not
tell
them
,
I
believe
you
be
very
honest
,
and
'
tis
bad
luck
to
tell
them
"
;
so
I
play
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
understand
the
game
well
enough
,
though
I
pretend
I
do
not
,
and
play
cautiously
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
keep
a
good
stock
in
my
lap
,
out
of
which
I
every
now
and
then
convey
some
into
my
pocket
,
but
in
such
a
manner
,
and
at
such
convenient
time
,
as
I
be
sure
he
could
not
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
play
a
great
while
,
and
have
very
good
luck
for
him
;
but
the
last
time
I
hold
the
box
,
they
set
me
high
,
and
I
throw
boldly
at
all
;
I
hold
the
box
till
I
gain
near
fourscore
guinea
,
but
lose
above
half
of
it
back
in
the
last
throw
;
so
I
get
up
,
for
I
be
afraid
I
should
lose
it
all
back
again
,
and
say
to
him
,
"
pray
come
,
sir
,
now
,
and
take
it
and
play
for
yourself
;
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
do
pretty
well
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
have
me
play
on
,
but
it
grow
late
,
and
I
desire
to
be
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
give
it
up
to
him
,
I
tell
him
I
hope
he
would
give
me
leave
to
tell
it
now
,
that
I
may
see
what
I
have
gain
,
and
how
lucky
I
have
be
for
him
;
when
I
tell
them
,
there
be
threescore
and
three
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
it
have
not
be
for
that
unlucky
throw
,
I
have
get
you
a
hundred
guinea
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
give
him
all
the
money
,
but
he
would
not
take
it
till
I
have
put
my
hand
into
it
,
and
take
some
for
myself
,
and
bid
me
please
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
refuse
it
,
and
be
positive
<EOS>
I
would
not
take
it
myself
;
if
he
have
a
mind
to
anything
of
that
kind
,
it
should
be
all
his
own
doing
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
gentleman
see
us
strive
cry
,
"
give
it
her
all
"
;
but
I
absolutely
refuse
that
.
 
<EOS>
then
one
of
them
say
,
"
D####n
ye
,
jack
,
halve
it
with
her
;
do
not
you
know
you
should
be
always
upon
even
term
with
the
lady
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
,
in
short
,
he
divide
it
with
me
,
and
I
bring
away
thirty
guinea
,
besides
about
forty
-
three
which
I
have
steal
privately
,
which
I
be
sorry
for
afterward
,
because
he
be
so
generous
.
  
<EOS>
thus
I
bring
home
seventy
-
three
guinea
,
and
let
my
old
governess
see
<EOS>
what
good
luck
I
have
at
play
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
her
advice
that
I
should
not
venture
again
,
and
I
take
her
counsel
,
for
I
never
go
there
any
more
;
for
I
know
as
well
as
<EOS>
she
,
if
the
itch
of
play
come
in
,
I
may
soon
lose
that
,
and
all
the
rest
of
what
I
have
get
.
  
<EOS>
Fortune
have
smile
upon
me
to
that
degree
,
and
I
have
thrive
so
much
,
and
my
governess
too
,
for
she
always
have
a
share
with
me
,
that
really
the
old
gentlewoman
begin
to
talk
of
leave
off
while
we
be
well
,
and
be
satisfied
with
what
we
have
get
;
but
,
I
know
not
what
fate
guide
me
,
I
be
as
backward
to
it
now
as
she
be
when
I
propose
it
to
her
before
,
and
so
in
an
ill
hour
we
give
over
the
thought
of
it
for
the
present
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
grow
more
hardened
and
audacious
than
ever
,
and
the
success
I
have
make
my
name
as
famous
as
any
thief
of
my
sort
ever
have
be
at
Newgate
,
and
in
the
Old
Bailey
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
sometime
take
the
liberty
to
play
the
same
game
over
again
,
which
be
not
accord
to
practice
,
which
however
succeed
not
amiss
;
but
generally
I
take
up
new
figure
,
and
contrive
to
appear
in
new
shape
every
time
I
go
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
rumble
time
of
the
year
,
and
the
gentleman
be
most
of
them
go
out
of
town
,
Tunbridge
,
and
Epsom
,
and
such
place
be
full
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
city
be
thin
,
and
I
think
our
trade
feel
it
a
little
,
as
well
as
other
;
so
that
at
the
latter
end
of
the
year
I
join
myself
with
a
gang
who
usually
go
every
year
to
Stourbridge
Fair
,
and
from
thence
to
Bury
Fair
,
in
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
We
promise
ourselves
great
thing
there
,
but
when
I
come
to
see
how
thing
be
,
I
be
weary
of
it
presently
;
for
except
mere
picking
of
pocket
,
there
be
little
worth
meddle
with
;
neither
,
if
a
booty
have
be
make
,
be
it
so
easy
carry
it
off
,
nor
be
there
such
a
variety
of
occasion
for
business
in
our
way
,
as
in
London
;
all
that
I
make
of
the
whole
journey
be
a
gold
watch
at
Bury
Fair
,
and
a
small
parcel
of
linen
at
Cambridge
,
which
give
me
an
occasion
to
take
leave
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
old
bite
,
and
I
think
may
do
with
a
country
shopkeeper
,
though
in
London
it
would
not
.
  
<EOS>
I
buy
at
a
linen
-
draper
's
shop
,
not
in
the
fair
,
but
in
the
town
of
Cambridge
,
as
much
fine
holland
and
other
thing
<EOS>
as
come
to
about
seven
pound
;
when
I
have
do
,
I
bid
them
be
send
to
such
an
inn
,
where
I
have
purposely
take
up
my
be
the
same
morning
,
as
if
I
be
to
lodge
there
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
order
the
draper
to
send
them
home
to
me
,
about
such
an
hour
,
to
the
inn
where
I
lay
,
and
I
would
pay
him
his
money
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
appoint
the
draper
send
the
good
,
and
I
place
one
of
our
gang
at
the
chamber
door
,
and
when
the
innkeeper
's
maid
bring
the
messenger
to
the
door
,
who
be
a
young
fellow
,
an
apprentice
,
<EOS>
almost
a
man
<EOS>
,
she
tell
him
her
mistress
be
asleep
,
but
if
he
would
leave
the
thing
and
call
in
about
an
hour
,
I
should
be
awake
,
and
he
may
have
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
the
parcel
very
readily
,
and
go
his
way
,
and
in
about
half
an
hour
<EOS>
my
maid
<EOS>
and
I
walk
off
,
and
<EOS>
that
very
evening
I
hire
a
horse
,
and
a
man
to
ride
before
me
,
and
go
to
Newmarket
,
and
from
thence
get
my
passage
in
a
coach
that
be
not
quite
full
to
St.
Edmund
's
Bury
,
where
,
as
I
tell
you
,
I
could
make
but
little
of
my
trade
,
only
at
a
little
country
opera
-
house
make
a
shift
to
carry
off
a
gold
watch
from
a
lady
's
side
,
who
be
not
only
intolerably
merry
,
but
,
as
I
think
,
a
little
fuddled
,
which
make
my
work
much
easy
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
off
with
this
little
booty
to
Ipswich
,
and
from
thence
to
Harwich
,
where
I
go
into
an
inn
,
as
if
I
have
newly
arrive
from
Holland
,
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
should
make
some
purchase
among
the
foreigner
that
come
on
shore
there
;
but
I
find
them
generally
empty
of
thing
of
value
,
except
what
be
in
their
portmanteaux
and
dutch
hamper
,
which
be
generally
guard
by
footman
;
however
,
I
fairly
get
one
of
their
portmanteaux
one
evening
out
of
the
chamber
where
the
gentleman
lie
,
the
footman
be
fast
asleep
on
the
bed
,
and
I
suppose
very
drunk
.
  
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
I
lodge
lie
next
to
the
Dutchman
's
,
and
have
drag
the
heavy
thing
with
much
ado
out
of
the
chamber
into
mine
,
I
go
out
into
the
street
,
to
see
if
I
could
find
any
possibility
of
carry
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
about
a
great
while
,
but
could
see
no
probability
either
of
get
out
the
thing
,
or
of
convey
away
the
good
that
be
in
it
if
I
have
open
it
,
the
town
be
so
small
,
and
I
a
perfect
stranger
in
it
;
so
I
be
return
with
a
resolution
to
carry
it
back
again
,
and
leave
it
where
I
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
just
in
that
very
moment
I
hear
a
man
make
a
noise
to
some
people
to
make
haste
,
for
the
boat
be
go
to
put
off
,
and
the
tide
would
be
spend
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
to
the
fellow
,
<EOS>
"
what
boat
be
it
,
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
you
belong
to
?
"
<EOS>
"
the
Ipswich
wherry
,
madam
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
do

go
off
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
this
moment
,
madam
,
"
say
he
<EOS>
;
"
do
you
want
to
go
thither
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
you
can
stay
till
I
fetch
my
thing
.
"
<EOS>
"
where
be
your
 
thing
,
madam
?
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
such
an
inn
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
go
with
you
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
very
civilly
,
"
and
bring
them
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
come
away
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
and
take
him
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
inn
be
in
a
great
hurry
,
the
packet
-
boat
from
Holland
be
just
come
in
,
and
two
coach
just
come
also
with
passenger
from
London
,
for
another
packet
-
boat
that
be
go
off
for
Holland
,
which
coach
be
to
go
back
next
day
with
the
passenger
that
be
just
land
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
hurry
it
be
not
much
minded
that
I
come
to
the
bar
and
pay
my
reckoning
,
tell
my
landlady
I
have
get
my
passage
by
sea
in
a
wherry
.
  
<EOS>
these
wherry
be
large
vessel
,
with
good
accommodation
for
carry
passenger
from
Harwich
to
London
;
and
though
they
be
call
wherry
,
which
be
a
word
use
in
the
Thames
for
a
small
boat
row
with
one
or
two
man
,
yet
these
be
vessel
able
to
carry
twenty
passenger
,
and
ten
or
fifteen
ton
of
good
,
and
fit
to
bear
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
I
have
find
out
by
inquire
the
night
before
into
the
several
way
of
go
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlady
be
very
courteous
,
take
my
money
for
my
reckoning
,
but
be
call
away
,
all
the
house
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
so
I
leave
her
,
take
the
fellow
up
to
my
chamber
,
give
him
the
trunk
,
or
portmanteau
,
for
it
be
like
a
trunk
,
and
wrap
it
about
with
an
old
apron
,
and
he
go
directly
to
his
boat
with
it
,
and
I
after
him
,
nobody
ask
us
the
least
question
about
it
;
as
for
the
drunken
dutch
footman
he
be
still
asleep
,
and
his
master
with
other
foreign
gentleman
at
supper
,
and
very
merry
below
,
so
<EOS>
I
go
clean
off
with
it
to
Ipswich
;
and
go
in
the
night
,
the
people
of
the
house
know
nothing
but
that
I
be
go
to
London
by
the
Harwich
wherry
,
as
I
have
tell
my
landlady
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
plague
at
Ipswich
with
the
custom
-
house
officer
,
who
stop
my
trunk
,
as
I
call
it
,
and
would
open
and
search
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
willing
,
I
tell
them
,
they
should
search
it
,
but
husband
have
the
key
,
and
he
be
not
yet
come
from
Harwich
;
this
I
say
,
that
if
upon
search
it
they
should
find
all
the
thing
be
such
as
properly
belong
to
a
man
rather
than
a
woman
,
it
should
not
seem
strange
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
be
positive
to
open
the
trunk
I
consent
to
have
it
be
break
open
,
that
be
to
say
,
to
have
the
lock
take
off
,
which
be
not
difficult
.
  
<EOS>
They
find
nothing
for
their
turn
,
for
the
trunk
have
be
search
before
,
but
they
discover
several
thing
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
,
as
particularly
a
parcel
of
money
in
french
pistol
,
and
some
dutch
ducatoon
or
rix
-
dollar
,
and
the
rest
be
chiefly
two
periwig
,
wear
-
linen
,
and
razor
,
wash
-
ball
,
perfume
,
and
other
useful
thing
necessary
for
a
gentleman
,
which
all
pass
for
my
husband
's
,
and
so
I
be
quit
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
very
early
in
the
morning
,
and
not
light
,
and
I
know
not
well
what
course
to
take
;
for
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
should
be
pursue
in
the
morning
,
and
perhaps
be
take
with
the
thing
about
me
;
so
I
resolve
upon
take
new
measure
.
<EOS>
I
go
publicly
to
an
inn
in
the
town
with
my
trunk
,
as
I
call
it
,
and
have
take
the
substance
out
,
I
do
not
think
the
lumber
of
it
worth
my
concern
;
however
,
I
give
it
the
landlady
of
the
house
with
a
charge
to
take
great
care
of
it
,
and
lie
it
up
safe
till
I
should
come
again
,
and
away
I
walk
in
to
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
get
into
the
town
a
great
way
from
the
inn
,
I
meet
with
an
ancient
woman
who
have
just
open
her
door
,
and
I
fall
into
chat
with
her
,
and
ask
her
a
great
many
wild
question
of
thing
all
remote
to
my
purpose
and
design
;
but
in
my
discourse
I
find
by
her
how
the
town
be
situate
,
that
I
be
in
a
street
that
go
out
towards
Hadley
,
but
that
such
a
street
go
towards
the
water
-
side
,
such
a
street
towards
Colchester
,
and
so
the
London
road
lie
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
soon
my
end
of
this
old
woman
,
for
I
only
want
to
know
which
be
the
London
road
,
and
away
I
walk
as
fast
as
I
could
;
not
that
I
intend
to
go
on
foot
,
either
to
London
or
to
Colchester
,
but
I
want
to
get
quietly
away
from
Ipswich
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
about
two
or
three
mile
,
and
then
I
meet
a
plain
countryman
,
who
be
busy
about
some
husbandry
work
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
what
,
and
I
ask
him
a
great
many
question
first
,
not
much
to
the
purpose
,
but
at
last
tell
him
I
be
go
for
London
,
and
the
coach
be
full
,
and
I
could
not
get
a
passage
,
and
ask
him
if
he
could
tell
me
where
to
hire
a
horse
that
would
carry
double
,
and
an
honest
man
to
ride
before
me
to
Colchester
,
that
so
I
may
get
a
place
there
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
the
honest
clown
look
earnestly
at
me
,
and
say
nothing
for
above
half
a
minute
,
when
,
scratch
his
poll
,
"
a
horse
,
say
you
and
to
Colchester
,
to
carry
double
?
 
<EOS>
why
yes
,
mistress
,
alack
-
a
-
day
,
you
may
have
horse
enough
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
that
I
take
for
grant
;
I
do
not
expect
it
without
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
but
,
mistress
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
much
be
you
willing
to
give
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
I
again
,
"
friend
,
I
do
not
know
what
your
rate
be
in
the
country
here
,
for
I
be
a
stranger
;
but
if
you
can
get
one
for
me
,
get
it
as
cheap
as
you
can
,
and
I
will
give
you
somewhat
for
your
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
be
honestly
say
too
,
"
say
the
countryman
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
so
honest
,
neither
,
"
say
I
to
myself
,
"
if
thou
knewest
all
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
mistress
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
a
horse
that
will
carry
double
,
and
I
do
not
much
care
if
I
go
myself
with
you
,
"
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
?
"
say
I
;
"
well
,
I
believe
you
be
an
honest
man
;
if
you
will
,
I
shall
be
glad
of
it
;
I
will
pay
you
in
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
look
ye
,
mistress
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
out
of
reason
with
you
,
then
;
if
I
carry
you
to
Colchester
,
it
will
be
worth
five
shilling
for
myself
and
my
horse
,
for
I
shall
hardly
come
back
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
hire
the
honest
man
and
his
horse
;
but
when
we
come
to
a
town
upon
the
road
(
I
do
not
remember
the
name
of
it
,
but
it
stand
upon
a
river
)
,
I
pretend
myself
very
ill
,
and
I
could
go
no
farther
that
night
<EOS>
but
if
he
would
stay
there
with
me
,
because
I
be
a
stranger
,
I
would
pay
him
for
himself
and
his
horse
with
all
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
do
because
I
know
the
dutch
gentleman
and
their
servant
would
be
upon
the
road
that
day
,
either
in
the
stagecoach
or
ride
post
,
and
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
but
the
drunken
fellow
,
or
somebody
else
that
may
have
see
me
at
Harwich
,
may
see
me
again
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
think
that
in
one
day
's
stop
they
would
be
all
go
by
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
all
that
night
there
,
and
the
next
morning
it
be
not
very
early
when
I
set
out
,
so
that
it
be
near
ten
o'clock
by
the
time
I
get
to
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
little
pleasure
that
I
see
the
town
where
I
have
so
many
pleasant
day
,
and
I
make
many
inquiry
after
the
good
old
friend
I
have
once
have
there
,
but
could
make
little
out
;
they
be
all
dead
or
remove
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
lady
have
be
all
married
or
go
to
London
;
the
old
gentleman
and
the
old
lady
that
have
be
my
early
benefactress
all
dead
;
and
which
trouble
me
most
,
the
young
gentleman
my
first
lover
,
and
afterwards
my
brother
-
in
-
law
,
be
dead
;
but
two
son
,
man
grow
,
be
leave
of
him
,
but
they
too
be
transplant
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
dismiss
my
old
man
here
,
and
stay
incognito
for
three
or
four
day
in
Colchester
,
and
then
take
a
passage
in
a
waggon
,
because
I
would
not
venture
be
see
in
the
Harwich
coach
.
<EOS>
but
I
need
not
have
use
so
much
caution
,
for
there
be
nobody
in
Harwich
but
the
woman
of
the
house
could
have
know
me
;
nor
be
it
rational
to
think
that
she
,
consider
the
hurry
she
be
in
,
and
that
she
never
see
me
but
once
,
and
that
by
candlelight
,
should
have
ever
discover
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
return
to
London
,
and
though
by
the
accident
of
the
last
adventure
I
get
something
considerable
,
yet
I
be
not
fond
of
any
more
country
ramble
,
nor
should
I
have
venture
abroad
again
if
I
have
carry
the
trade
on
to
the
end
of
my
day
.
<EOS>
I
give
my
governess
a
history
of
my
travel
;
she
like
the
Harwich
journey
well
enough
,
and
in
discoursing
of
these
thing
between
ourselves
she
observe
,
that
a
thief
be
a
creature
that
watch
the
advantage
of
other
people
's
mistake
,
'
tis
impossible
but
that
to
one
that
be
vigilant
and
industrious
many
opportunity
must
happen
,
and
therefore
she
think
that
one
so
exquisitely
keen
in
the
trade
as
I
be
,
would
scarce
fail
of
something
extraordinary
wherever
I
go
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
every
branch
of
my
story
,
if
duly
consider
,
may
be
useful
to
honest
people
,
and
afford
a
due
caution
to
people
of
some
sort
or
other
to
guard
against
the
like
surprise
,
and
to
have
their
eye
about
them
when
they
have
to
do
with
stranger
of
any
kind
,
for
'
tis
very
seldom
that
some
snare
or
other
be
not
in
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
moral
,
indeed
,
of
all
my
history
be
leave

by
the
sense
and
judgment
of
the
reader
;
I
be
not
qualified
to
preach
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
let
the
experience
of
one
creature
completely
wicked
,
and
completely
miserable
,
be
a
storehouse
of
useful
warning
to
those
that
read
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
draw
now
towards
a
new
variety
of
the
scene
of
life
.
<EOS>
upon
my
return
,
be
harden
by
along
race
of
crime
,
and
success
unparalleled
,
at
least
in
the
reach
of
my
own
knowledge
,
I
have
,
as
I
have
say
,
no
thought
of
lay
down
a
trade
which
,
if
I
be
to
judge
by
the
example
of
other
,
must
,
however
,
end
at
last
in
misery
and
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
Christmas
day
follow
,
in
the
evening
,
that
,
to
finish
a
long
train
of
wickedness
,
I
go
abroad
to
see
what
may
offer
in
my
way
;
when
go
by
a
work
silversmith
's
in
Foster
Lane
,
I
see
a
tempting
bait
indeed
,
and
not
be
resist
by
one
of
my
occupation
,
for
the
shop
have
nobody
in
it
,
as
I
could
see
,
and
a
great
deal
of
loose
plate
lie
in
the
window
,
and
at
the
seat
of
the
man
,
who
usually
,
as
I
suppose
,
work
at
one
side
of
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
boldly
in
,
and
be
just
go
to
lay
my
hand
upon
a
piece
of
plate
,
and
may
have
do
it
,
and
carry
it
clear
off
,
for
any
care
that
the
man
who
belong
to
the
shop
have
take
of
it
;
but
an
officious
fellow
in
a
house
,
not
a
shop
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
,
see
me
go
in
,
and
observe
that
there
be
nobody
in
the
shop
,
come
run
over
the
street
,
and
into
the
shop
,
and
without
ask
me
what
I
be
,
or
who
,
seize
upon
me
,
an
cry
out
for
the
people
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
as
I
say
above
,
touch
anything
in
the
shop
,
and
see
a
glimpse
of
somebody
run
over
to
the
shop
,
I
have
so
much
presence
of
mind
as
to
knock
very
 
hard
with
my
foot
on
the
floor
of
the
house
,
and
be
just
call
out
too
,
when
the
fellow
lay
hand
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
have
always
most
courage
when
I
be
in
most
danger
,
so
when
the
fellow
lay
hand
on
me
,
I
stand
very
high
upon
it
,
that
I
come
in
to
buy
half
a
dozen
of
silver
spoon
;
and
to
my
good
fortune
,
it
be
a
silversmith
's
that
sell
plate
,
as
well
as
work
plate
for
other
shop
.
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
laugh
at
that
part
,
and
put
such
a
value
upon
the
service
that
he
have
do
his
neighbour
,
that
he
would
have
it
be
that
I
come
not
to
buy
,
but
to
steal
;
and
raise
a
great
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
to
the
master
of
the
shop
,
who
by
this
time
be
fetch
home
from
some
neighbouring
place
,
that
it
be
in
vain
to
make
noise
,
and
enter
into
talk
there
of
the
case
;
the
fellow
have
insist
that
I
come
to
steal
,
and
he
must
prove
it
,
and
I
desire
we
may
go
before
a
magistrate
without
any
more
word
;
for
I
begin
to
see
I
should
be
too
hard
for
the
man
that
have
seize
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
shop
be
really
not
so
violent
as
the
man
from
t'other
side
of
the
way
;
and
the
man
say
,
"
Mistress
,
you
may
come
into
the
shop
with
a
good
design
for
aught
I
know
,
but
it
seem
a
dangerous
thing
for
you
to
come
into
such
a
shop
as
mine
be
,
when
you
see
nobody
there
;
and
I
can
not
do
justice
to
my
neighbour
,
who
be
so
kind
to
me
,
as
not
to
acknowledge
he
have
reason
on
his
side
;
though
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
do
not
find
you
attempt
to
take
anything
,
and
I
really
know
not
what
to
do
in
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
press
him
to
go
before
a
magistrate
with
me
,
and
if
anything
could
be
prove
on
me
that
be
like
a
design
of
robbery
,
I
should
willingly
submit
,
but
if
not
,
I
expect
reparation
.
  
<EOS>
just
while
we
be
in
this
debate
,
and
a
crowd
of
people
gather
about
the
door
,
come
by
Sir
T.
B.
,
an
alderman
of
the
city
,
and
justice
of
the
peace
,
and
the
goldsmith
hearing
of
it
,
go
out
,
and
entreat
his
worship
to
come
in
and
decide
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
give
the
goldsmith
his
due
,
he
tell
his
story
with
a
great
deal
of
justice
and
moderation
,
and
the
fellow
that
have
come
over
,
and
seize
upon
me
,
tell
his
with
as
much
heat
and
foolish
passion
,
which
do
me
good
still
,
rather
than
harm
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
then
to
my
turn
to
speak
,
and
I
tell
his
worship
that
I
be
a
stranger
in
London
,
be
newly
come
out
of
the
north
;
that
I
lodge
in
such
a
place
,
that
I
be
pass
this
street
,
and
go
into
the
goldsmith
's
shop
to
buy
half
a
dozen
of
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
by
great
luck
I
have
an
old
silver
spoon
in
my
pocket
,
which
I
pull
out
,
and
tell
him
I
have
carry
that
spoon
to
match
it
with
half
a
dozen
of
new
one
,
that
it
may
match
some
I
have
in
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
that
see
nobody
I
the
shop
,
I
knock
with
my
foot
very
hard
to
make
the
people
hear
,
and
have
also
call
aloud
with
my
voice
;
'
tis
true
,
there
be
loose
plate
in
the
shop
,
but
that
nobody
could
say
I
have
touch
any
of
it
,
or
go
near
it
;
that
a
fellow
come
run
into
the
shop
out
of
the
street
,
and
lay
hand
on
me
in
a
furious
manner
,
in
the
very
moment
while
I
be
call
for
the
people
of
the
house
;
that
if
he
have
really
have
a
mind
to
have
do
his
neighbour
any
service
,
he
should
have
stand
at
a
distance
,
and
silently
watch
to
see
whether
I
have
touch
anything
or
no
,
and
then
have
clap
in
upon
me
,
and
take
me
in
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
true
,
"
say
Mr.
Alderman
,
and
turn
to
the
fellow
that
stop
me
,
he
ask
him
if
it
be
true
that
I
knock
with
my
foot
?
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
yes
,
I
have
knock
,
but
that
may
be
because
of
his
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
the
alderman
,
take
him
short
,
"
now
you
contradict
yourself
,
<EOS>
for
just
now
you
say
she
be
in
the
shop
with
her
back
to
you
,
and
do
not
see
you
till
you
come
upon
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
now
it
be
true
that
my
back
be
partly
to
the
street
,
but
yet
as
my
business
be
of
a
kind
that
require
me
to
have
my
eye
every
way
,
so
I
really
have
a
glance
of
him
run
over
,
as
I
say
before
,
though
he
do
not
perceive
it
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
full
hearing
,
the
alderman
give
it
as
his
opinion
that
his
neighbour
be
under
a
mistake
,
and
that
I
be
innocent
,
and
the
goldsmith
acquiesce
in
it
too
,
and
his
wife
,
and
so
I
be
dismiss
;
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
go
to
depart
,
Mr.
Alderman
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
hold
,
madam
,
if
you
be
design
to
buy
spoon
,
I
hope
you
will
not
let
my
friend
here
lose
his
customer
by
the
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
readily
answer
,
"
no
,
sir
,
I
will
buy
the
spoon
still
,
if
he
can
match
my
odd
spoon
,
which
I
bring
for
a
pattern
"
;
and
the
goldsmith
show
me
some
of
the
very
same
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
weigh
the
spoon
,
and
they
come
to
five
-
and
-
thirty
shilling
,
so
I
pull
out
my
purse
to
pay
him
,
in
which
I
have
near
twenty
guinea
,
for
I
never
go
without
such
a
sum
about
me
,
whatever
may
happen
,
and
I
find
it
of
use
at
other
time
as
well
as
now
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Alderman
see
my
money
,
he
say
,
"
well
,
madam
,
now
I
be
satisfied
you
be
wrong
,
and
it
be
for
this
reason
that
I
move
you
should
buy
the
spoon
,
and
stay
till
you
have
buy
them
,
for
if
you
have
not
have
money
to
pay
for
them
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
suspect
that
you
do
not
come
into
the
shop
with
an
intent
to
buy
,
for
indeed
the
sort
of
people
who
come
upon
these
design
that
you
have
be
charge
with
,
be
seldom
troubled
with
much
gold
in
their
pocket
,
as
I
see
you
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
smile
,
and
tell
his
worship
,
that
then
I
owe
something
of
his
favour
to
my
money
,
but
I
hope
he
see
reason
also
in
the
justice
he
have
do
me
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
<EOS>
yes
,
he
have
,
but
this
have
confirm
his
opinion
,
and
he
be
fully
satisfied
now
of
my
have
be
injure
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
come
off
with
fly
colour
,
though
from
an
affair
in
which
I
be
at
the
very
brink
of
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
but
three
day
after
this
,
that
not
at
all
make
cautious
by
my
former
danger
,
as
I
use
to
be
,
and
still
pursue
the
art
which
I
have
so
long
be
employ
in
<EOS>
,
I
venture
into
a
house
where
I
see
the
door
open
,
and
furnish
myself
,
as
I
though
verily
without
be
perceive
,
with
two
piece
of
flower
silk
,
such
as
they
call
brocaded
silk
,
very
rich
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
mercer
's
shop
,
nor
a
warehouse
of
a
mercer
,
but
look
like
a
private
dwelling
-
house
,
and
be
,
it
seem
,
inhabit
by
a
man
that
sell
good
for
the
weaver
to
the
mercer
,
like
a
broker
or
factor
.
  
<EOS>
that
I
may
make
short
of
this
black
part
of
this
story
,
I
be
attack
by
two
wench
that
come
open
-
mouthed
at
me
just
as
I
be
go
out
at
the
door
,
and
one
of
them
pull
me
back
into
the
room
,
while
the
other
shut
the
door
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
them
good
word
,
but
there
be
no
room
for
it
,
two
fiery
dragon
could
not
have
be
more
furious
than
they
be
;
they
tear
my
clothe
,
bully
and
roar
as
if
they
would
have
murder
me
;
the
mistress
of
the
house
come
next
,
and
then
the
master
,
and
all
outrageous
,
for
a
while
especially
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
the
master
very
good
word
,
tell
him
the
door
be
open
,
and
thing
be
a
temptation
to
me
,
that
I
be
poor
and
distressed
,
and
poverty
be
when
many
could
not
resist
,
and
beg
him
with
tear
to
have
pity
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
mistress
of
the
house
be
move
with
compassion
,
and
incline
to
have
let
me
go
,
and
have
almost
persuade
her
husband
to
it
also
,
but
the
saucy
wench
be
run
,
even
before
they
be
send
,
and
have
fetch
a
constable
,
and
then
the
master
say
he
could
not
go
back
,
I
must
go
before
a
justice
,
and
answer
his
wife
that
he
may
come
into
trouble
himself
if
he
should
let
me
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
sight
of
the
constable
,
indeed
,
strike
me
with
terror
,
and
I
think
I
should
have
sink
into
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
into
fainting
,
and
indeed
the
people
themselves
think
I
would
have
die
,
when
the
woman
argue
again
for
me
,
and
entreat
her
husband
,
see
they
have
lose
nothing
,
to
let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
him
to
pay
for
the
two
piece
,
whatever
the
value
be
,
though
I
have
not
get
them
,
and
argue
that
as
he
have
his
good
,
and
have
really
lose
nothing
,
it
would
be
cruel
to
pursue
me
to
death
,
and
have
my
blood
for
the
bare
attempt
of
take
them
.
<EOS>
I
put
the
constable
in
mind
that
I
have
break
no
door
,
nor
carry
anything
away
;
and
when
I
come
to
the
justice
,
and
plead
there
that
I
have
neither
break
anything
to
get
in
,
nor
carry
anything
out
,
the
justice
be
incline
to
have
release
me
;
but
the
first
saucy
jade
that
stop
me
,
affirm
that
I
be
go
out
with
the
good
,
but
that
she
stop
me
and
pull
me
back
as
I
be
upon
the
threshold
,
the
justice
upon
that
point
commit
me
,
and
I
be
carry
to
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
that
horrid
place
!
<EOS>
my
very
blood
chill
at
the
mention
of
its
name
;
the
place
where
so
many
of
my
comrade
have
be
lock
up
,
and
from
whence
they
go
to
the
fatal
tree
;
the
place
where
my
mother
suffer
so
deeply
,
where
I
be
bring
into
the
world
,
and
from
whence
I
expect
no
redemption
but
by
an
infamous
death
:
 
to
conclude
,
the
place
that
have
so
long
expect
me
,
and
which
with
so
much
art
and
success
<EOS>
I
have
so
long
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
fix
indeed
;
'
tis
impossible
to
describe
the
terror
of
my
mind
,
when
I
be
first
bring
in
,
and
when
I
look
around
upon
all
the
horror
of
that
dismal
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
on
myself
as
lose
,
and
that
I
have
nothing
to
think
of
but
of
go
out
of
the
world
,
and
that
with
the
utmost
infamy
:
 
the
hellish
noise
,
the
roaring
,
swearing
,
and
clamour
,
the
stench
and
nastiness
,
and
all
the
dreadful
crowd
of
afflict
thing
that
I
see
there
,
join
together
to
make
the
place
seem
an
emblem
of
hell
itself
,
and
a
kind
of
an
entrance
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
reproach
myself
with
the
many
hint
I
have
have
,
as
I
have
mention
above
,
from
my
own
reason
,
from
the
sense
of
my
good
circumstance
,
and
of
the
many
danger
I
have
escape
,
to
leave
off
while
I
be
well
,
and
how
I
have
withstand
them
all
,
and
harden
my
thought
against
all
fear
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
I
be
hurry
on
by
an
inevitable
and
unseen
fate
to
this
day
of
misery
,
and
that
now
I
be
to
expiate
all
my
offence
at
the
gallow
;
that
I
be
now
to
give
satisfaction
to
justice
with
my
blood
,
and
that
I
be
come
to
the
last
hour
of
my
life
and
of
my
wickedness
together
.
 
<EOS>
these
thing
pour
themselves
in
upon
my
thought
in
a
confused
manner
,
and
leave
me
overwhelmed
with
melancholy
and
despair
.
  
<EOS>
Them
I
repent
heartily
of
all
my
life
past
,
but
that
repentance
yield
me
no
satisfaction
,
no
peace
,
no
,
not
in
the
least
,
because
,
as
I
say
to
myself
,
it
be
repent
after
the
power
of
further
sinning
be
take
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
not
to
mourn
that
I
have
commit
such
crime
,
and
for
the
fact
as
it
be
an
offence
against
God
and
my
neighbour
,
but
I
mourn
that
I
be
to
be
punish
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
penitent
,
as
I
think
,
not
that
I
have
sin
,
but
that
I
be
to
suffer
,
and
this
take
away
all
the
comfort
,
and
even
the
hope
of
my
repentance
in
my
own
thought
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
no
sleep
for
several
night
or
day
after
I
come
into
that
wretched
place
,
and
glad
I
would
have
be
for
some
time
to
have
die
there
,
though
I
do
not
consider
die
as
it
ought
to
be
consider
neither
;
indeed
,
nothing
could
be
fill
with
more
horror
to
my
imagination
than
the
very
place
,
nothing
be
more
odious
to
me
than
the
company
that
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
but
be
send
to
any
place
in
the
world
,
and
not
to
Newgate
,
I
should
have
think
myself
happy
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
how
do
the
harden
wretch
that
be
there
before
me
triumph
over
me
!
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
flander
come
to
Newgate
at
last
?
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mary
,
Mrs.
Molly
,
and
after
that
plain
Moll
Flanders
?
<EOS>
They
think
the
devil
have
help
me
,
they
say
,
that
I
have
reign
so
long
;
they
expect
me
there
many
year
ago
,
and
be
I
come
at
last
?
 
<EOS>
then
they
flout
me
with
my
dejection
,
welcome
me
to
the
place
,
wish
me
joy
,
bid
me
have
a
good
heart
,
not
to
be
cast
down
<EOS>
,
thing
may
not
be
so
bad
as
I
fear
,
and
the
like
;
then
call
for
brandy
,
and
drink
to
me
,
but
put
it
all
up
to
my
score
,
for
they
tell
me
I
be
but
just
come
to
the
college
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
sure
I
have
money
in
my
pocket
,
though
they
have
none
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
one
of
this
crew
how
long
she
have
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
four
month
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
how
the
place
look
to
her
when
she
first
come
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
as
it
do
now
to
you
,
"
say
she
,
dreadful
and
frightful
'
;
that
she
think
she
be
in
hell
;
"
and
I
believe
so
still
,
"
add
she
,
"
but
it
be
natural
to
me
now
,
I
do
not
disturb
myself
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
be
in
no
danger
of
what
be
to
follow
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
for
you
be
mistaken
there
,
I
assure
you
,
for
I
be
under
sentence
,
only
I
plead
my
belly
,
but
I
be
no
more
with
child
than
the
judge
that
try
me
,
and
I
expect
to
be
call
down
next
session
.
<EOS>
"
this
"
call
down
"
be
call
down
to
their
former
judgment
,
when
a
woman
have
be
respite
for
her
belly
,
but
prove
not
to
be
with
child
,
or
if
she
have
be
with
child
,
and
have
be
bring
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
you
thus
easy
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
can
not
help
myself
;
what
signify
be
sad
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
hang
,
there
be
an
end
of
me
,
"
say
she
;
and
away
she
turn
dancing
,
and
sing
as
she
go
the
follow
piece
of
Newgate
wit
#
#

"
if
I
swing
by
the
string
     
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
the
bell
re
     
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
an
end
of
poor
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
mention
this
because
it
would
be
worth
the
observation
of
any
prisoner
,
who
shall
hereafter
fall
into
the
same
misfortune
,
and
come
to
that
dreadful
place
of
Newgate
,
how
time
,
necessity
,
and
converse
with
the
wretch
that
be
there
familiarize
the
place
to
them
;
how
at
last
they
become
reconcile
to
that
which
at
first
be
the
great
dread
upon
their
spirit
in
the
world
,
and
be
as
impudently
cheerful
and
merry
in
their
misery
as
they
be
when
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
as
some
do
,
this
devil
be
not
so
black
as
he
be
paint
;
for
indeed
no
colour
can
represent
the
place
to
the
life
,
not
any
soul
conceive
aright
of
it
but
those
who
have
be
suffer
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
hell
should
become
by
degree
so
natural
,
and
not
only
tolerable
,
but
even
agreeable
<EOS>
,
be
a
thing
unintelligible
but
by
those
who
have
experience
it
,
as
I
have
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
night
that
I
be
send
to
Newgate
,
I
send
the
news
of
it
to
my
old
governess
,
who
be
surprised
at
it
,
you
may
be
sure
,
and
spend
the
night
almost
as
ill
out
of
Newgate
,
as
I
do
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
she
come
to
see
me
;
she
do
what
she
could
to
comfort
me
,
but
she
see
that
be
to
no
purpose
;
however
,
as
she
say
,
to
sink
under
the
weight
be
but
to
increase
the
weight
;
she
immediately
apply
herself
to
all
the
proper
method
to
prevent
the
effect
of
it
,
which
we
fear
,
and
first
she
find
out
the
two
fiery
jade
that
have
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
She
tamper
with
them
,
offer
them
money
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
try
all
imaginable
way
to
prevent
a
prosecution
;
she
offer
one
of
the
wench
#
#
#
#
100
to
go
away
from
her
mistress
,
and
not
to
appear
against
me
,
but
she
be
so
resolute
,
that
though
she
be
but
a
servant
maid
at
#
#
#
#
3
a
year
wage
or
thereabout
,
she
refuse
it
,
and
would
have
refuse
it
,
as
my
governess
say
she
believe
,
if
she
have
offer
her
#
#
#
#
500
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
attack
the
other
maid
;
she
be
not
so
hard
-
hearted
in
appearance
as
the
other
,
and
sometimes
seem
inclined
to
be
merciful
;
but
the
first
wench
keep
her
up
,
and
change
her
mind
,
and
would
not
so
much
as
let
my
governess
talk
with
her
,
but
threaten
to
have
her
up
for
tamper
with
the
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
apply
to
the
master
,
that
be
to
say
<EOS>
,
the
man
whose
good
have
be
steal
,
and
particularly
to
his
wife
,
who
,
as
I
tell
you
,
be
incline
at
first
to
have
some
compassion
for
me
;
she
find
the
woman
the
same
still
,
but
the
man
allege
he
be
bind
by
the
justice
that
commit
me
,
to
prosecute
,
and
that
he
should
forfeit
his
recognisance
.
  
<EOS>
My
governess
offer
to
find
friend
that
should
get
his
recognisance
off
of
the
file
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
that
he
should
not
suffer
;
but
it
be
not
possible
to
convince
him
that
could
be
do
,
or
that
he
could
be
safe
any
way
in
the
world
but
by
appear
against
me
;
so
I
be
to
have
three
witness
of
fact
against
me
,
the
master
and
his
two
maid
;
that
be
to
say
,
I
be
as
certain
to
be
cast
for
my
life
as
I
be
certain
that
I
be
alive
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
<EOS>
to
think
of
die
,
and
prepare
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
but
<EOS>
a
sad
foundation
to
build
upon
,
as
I
say
before
,
for
all
my
repentance
appear
to
me
to
be
only
the
effect
of
my
fear
of
death
,
not
a
sincere
regret
for
the
wicked
life
that
I
have
live
,
and
which
have
bring
this
misery
upon
me
,
for
the
offend
my
Creator
,
who
be
now
suddenly
to
be
my
judge
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
many
day
here
under
the
utmost
horror
of
soul
;
I
have
death
,
as
it
be
,
in
view
,
and
thought
of
nothing
night
and
day
,
but
of
gibbet
and
halter
,
evil
spirit
and
devil
;
it
be
not
to
be
express
by
word
how
I
be
harass
,
between
the
dreadful
apprehension
of
death
and
the
terror
of
my
conscience
reproach
me
with
my
past
horrible
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
ordinary
of
Newgate
come
to
me
,
and
talk
a
little
in
his
way
,
but
all
his
divinity
run
upon
confess
my
crime
,
as
he
call
it
(
though
he
know
not
what
I
be
in
for
)
,
make
a
full
discovery
,
and
the
like
,
without
which
he
tell
me
God
would
never
forgive
me
;
and
he
say
so
little
to
the
purpose
,
that
I
have
no
manner
of
consolation
from
him
;
and
then
to
observe
the
poor
creature
preach
confession
and
repentance
to
me
in
the
morning
,
and
find
him
drunk
with
brandy
and
spirit
by
noon
,
this
have
something
in
it
so
shocking
,
that
I
begin
to
nauseate
the
man
more
than
his
work
,
and
his
work
too
by
degree
,
for
the
sake
of
the
man
;
so
that
I
desire
him
to
trouble
me
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
it
be
,
but
by
the
indefatigable
application
of
my
diligent
governess
I
have
no
bill
prefer
against
me
the
first
session
<EOS>
,
I
mean
to
the
grand
jury
,
at
Guildhall
;
so
I
have
another
month
or
five
week
before
me
,
and
without
doubt
this
ought
to
have
be
accept
by
me
,
as
so
much
time
<EOS>
give
me
for
reflection
upon
what
be
past
,
and
preparation
for
what
be
to
come
;
or
,
in
a
word
,
I
ought
to
have
esteem
it
as
a
space
give
me
for
repentance
,
and
have
employ
it
as
such
,
but
it
be
not
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
(
as
before
)
for
be
in
Newgate
,
but
have
very
few
sign
of
repentance
about
me
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
like
the
water
in
the
cavity
and
hollow
of
mountain
,
which
petrify
and
turn
into
stone
whatever
they
be
suffer
to
drop
on
,
so
the
continual
conversing
with
such
a
crew
of
hell
-
hound
as
I
be
,
have
the
same
common
operation
upon
me
as
upon
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
degenerate
into
stone
;
I
turn
first
stupid
and
senseless
,
then
brutish
and
thoughtless
,
and
at
last
raving
mad
as
any
of
them
be
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
become
as
naturally
pleased
and
easy
with
the
place
,
as
if
indeed
I
have
be
bear
there
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
scarce
possible
to
imagine
that
our
nature
should
be
capable
of
so
much
degeneracy
,
as
to
make
that
pleasant
and
agreeable
that
in
itself
be
the
most
complete
misery
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
circumstance
that
I
think
it
be
scarce
possible
to
mention
a
bad
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
as
exquisitely
miserable
as
,
speak
of
common
case
,
it
be
possible
for
any
one
to
be
that
have
life
and
health
,
and
money
to
help
them
,
as
I
have
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
weight
of
guilt
upon
me
enough
to
sink
any
creature
who
have
the
least
power
of
reflection
leave
,
and
have
any
sense
upon
them
of
the
happiness
of
this
life
,
of
the
misery
of
another
;
then
I
have
at
first
remorse
indeed
,
but
<EOS>
no
repentance
;
I
have
now
neither
remorse
nor
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
crime
charge
on
me
,
the
punishment
of
which
be
death
by
our
law
;
<EOS>
the
proof
so
evident
,
that
there
be
no
room
for
me
so
much
as
to
plead
not
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
name
of
an
old
offender
,
so
that
I
have
nothing
to
expect
but
death
in
a
few
week
'
time
,
neither
have
I
myself
any
thought
of
escape
;
and
yet
a
certain
strange
lethargy
of
soul
possess
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
trouble
,
no
apprehension
,
no
sorrow
about
me
,
the
first
surprise
be
go
;
I
be
,
I
may
well
say
,
I
know
not
how
;
<EOS>
my
sense
,
my
reason
,
nay
,
my
conscience
,
be
all
asleep
;
my
course
of
life
for
forty
year
have
be
a
horrid
complication
of
wickedness
,
whoredom
,
adultery
,
incest
,
lying
,
theft
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
everything
but
murder
and
treason
have
be
my
practice
from
the
age
of
eighteen
,
or
thereabout
,
to
three
-
score
;
and
now
I
be
engulf
in
the
misery
of
punishment
,
and
have
an
infamous
death
just
at
the
door
,
and
yet
I
have
no
sense
of
my
condition
,
<EOS>
no
thought
of
heaven
or
hell
at
least
,
that
go
any
farther
than
a
bare
fly
touch
,
like
the
stitch
or
pain
that
give
a
hint
and
go
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
neither
have
a
heart
to
ask
God
's
mercy
,
nor
indeed
to
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
this
,
I
think
,
I
have
give
a
brief
description
of
the
complete
misery
on
earth
.
  
<EOS>
all
my
terrifying
thought
be
past
,
the
horror
of
the
place
be
become
familiar
,
and
I
feel
no
more
uneasiness
at
the
noise
and
clamour
of
the
prison
,
than
they
do
who
make
that
noise
;
in
a
word
,
I
be
become
a
mere
Newgate
-
bird
,
as
wicked
and
as
outrageous
as
any
of
them
;
nay
,
I
scarce
retain
the
habit
and
custom
of
good
breeding
and
manner
,
which
all
along
till
now
run
through
my
conversation
;
so
thorough
a
degeneracy
have
possess
me
,
that
I
be
no
more
the
same
thing
that
I
have
be
,
than
if
I
have
never
be
otherwise
than
what
I
be
now
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
this
harden
part
of
my
life
I
have
another
sudden
surprise
,
which
call
me
back
a
little
to
that
thing
call
sorrow
,
which
indeed
I
begin
to
be
past
the
sense
of
before
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
one
night
that
there
be
bring
into
the
prison
late
the
night
before
three
highwayman
,
who
have
commit
robbery
somewhere
on
the
road
to
Windsor
,
Hounslow
Heath
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
be
,
and
be
pursue
to
Uxbridge
by
the
country
,
and
be
take
there
after
a
gallant
resistance
,
in
which
I
know
not
how
many
of
the
country
people
be
wound
,
and
some
kill
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
wonder
that
we
prisoner
be
all
desirous
enough
to
see
these
brave
,
top
gentleman
,
that
be
talk
up
to
be
such
as
their
fellow
have
not
be
know
,
and
especially
because
it
be
say
they
would
in
the
morning
be
remove
into
the
press
-
yard
,
have
give
money
to
the
head
master
of
the
prison
,
to
be
allow
the
liberty
of
that
well
part
of
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
that
be
woman
place
ourselves
in
the
way
,
that
we
would
be
sure
to
see
them
;
but
nothing
could
express
the
amazement
and
surprise
<EOS>
I
be
in
,
when
the
very
first
man
that
come
out
I
know
to
be
my
Lancashire
husband
,
the
same
who
live
so
well
at
Dunstable
,
and
the
same
who
I
afterwards
see
at
Brickhill
,
when
I
be
married
to
my
last
husband
,
as
have
be
relate
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
strike
dumb
at
the
sight
,
and
know
neither
what
to
say
nor
what
to
do
;
he
do
not
know
me
,
and
that
be
all
the
present
relief
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
quit
my
company
,
and
retire
as
much
as
that
dreadful
place
suffer
anybody
to
retire
,
and
I
cry
vehemently
for
a
great
while
.
 
<EOS>
"
dreadful
creature
that
I
be
,
"
say
I
,
"
how
may
poor
people
have
I
make
miserable
?
<EOS>
how
many
desperate
wretch
have
I
send
to
the
devil
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
at
Chester
he
be
ruin
by
that
match
,
and
that
his
fortune
be
make
desperate
on
my
account
;
for
that
thinking
I
have
be
a
fortune
,
he
be
run
into
debt
more
than
he
be
able
to
pay
,
and
that
he
know
not
what
course
to
take
;
that
he
would
go
into
the
army
and
carry
a
musket
,
or
buy
a
horse
and
take
a
tour
,
as
he
call
it
;
and
though
I
never
tell
him
that
I
be
a
fortune
,
and
so
do
not
actually
deceive
him
myself
,
yet
<EOS>
I
do
encourage
the
have
it
think
that
I
be
so
,
and
by
that
mean
I
be
the
occasion
originally
of
his
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
the
surprise
of
the
thing
only
strike
deeper
into
my
thought
,
any
give
me
strong
reflection
than
all
that
have
befall
me
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
grieve
day
and
night
for
him
,
and
the
more
for
that
<EOS>
they
tell
me
he
be
the
captain
of
the
gang
,
and
that
he
have
commit
<EOS>
so
many
robbery
,
that
Hind
,
or
Whitney
,
or
the
Golden
Farmer
be
fool
to
him
;
that
he
would
surely
be
hang
if
there
be
no
more
man
leave
in
the
country
he
be
bear
in
;
and
that
there
would
abundance
of
people
come
in
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
overwhelmed
with
grief
for
him
;
my
own
case
give
me
no
disturbance
compare
to
this
,
and
I
load
myself
with
reproach
on
his
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
bewail
his
misfortune
,
and
the
ruin
he
be
now
come
to
,
at
such
a
rate
,
that
I
relish
nothing
now
as
I
do
before
,
and
the
first
reflection
I
make
upon
the
horrid
,
detestable
life
I
have
live
begin
to
return
upon
me
,
and
as
these
thing
return
,
my
abhorrence
of
the
place
I
be
in
,
and
of
the
way
of
live
in
it
,
return
also
;
in
a
word
,
I
be
perfectly
change
,
and
become
another
body
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
under
these
influence
of
sorrow
for
him
,
come
notice
to
me
that
the
next
session
approach
there
would
be
a
bill
prefer
to
the
grand
jury
against
me
,
and
that
I
should
be
certainly
try
for
my
life
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
My
temper
be
touch
before
,
the
harden
,
wretched
boldness
of
spirit
which
I
have
acquire
abate
,
and
conscious
in
the
prison
,
guilt
begin
to
flow
in
upon
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
begin
to
think
,
and
to
think
be
one
real
advance
from
hell
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
all
that
hellish
,
hardened
state
and
temper
of
soul
,
which
I
have
say
so
much
of
before
,
be
but
a
deprivation
of
thought
;
he
that
be
restore
to
his
power
of
thinking
,
be
restore
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
begin
,
I
say
,
to
think
,
the
first
think
that
occur
to
me
break
out
thus
:
 
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
die
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
cast
,
to
be
sure
,
and
there
be
nothing
beyond
that
<EOS>
but
death
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
friend
;
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
certainly
cast
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
 
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
sad
thought
,
you
will
say
,
to
be
the
first
,
after
so
long
a
time
,
that
have
start
into
my
soul
of
that
kind
,
and
yet
even
this
be
nothing
but
fright
<EOS>
at
what
be
to
come
;
there
be
not
a
word
of
sincere
repentance
in
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
indeed
dreadfully
deject
,
and
disconsolate
to
the
last
degree
;
and
as
I
have
no
friend
in
the
world
to
communicate
my
distressed
thought
to
,
it
lie
so
heavy
upon
me
,
that
it
throw
me
into
fit
and
swooning
several
time
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
for
my
old
governess
,
and
she
,
give
her
her
due
,
act
the
part
of
a
true
friend
.
 
<EOS>
She
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
prevent
the
grand
jury
find
the
bill
.
 
<EOS>
She
seek
out
one
or
two
of
the
juryman
,
talk
with
them
,
and
endeavour
to
possess
them
with
favourable
disposition
,
on
account
that
nothing
be
take
away
,
and
no
house
break
,
etc
.
<EOS>
;
but
all
would
not
do
,
they
be
over
-
rule
by
the
rest
;
the
two
wench
swear
home
to
the
fact
,
and
the
jury
find
the
bill
against
me
for
robbery
and
house
-
break
,
that
is
,
for
felony
and
burglary
.
  
<EOS>
I
sink
down
when
they
bring
me
news
of
it
,
and
after
I
come
to
myself
again
,
I
think
I
should
have
die
with
the
weight
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
governess
act
a
true
mother
to
me
;
she
pity
me
,
she
cry
with
me
,
and
for
me
,
but
she
could
not
help
me
;
and
to
add
to
the
terror
of
it
,
'
twa
the
discourse
all
over
the
house
that
I
should
die
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
hear
them
talk
it
among
themselves
very
often
,
and
see
them
shake
their
head
and
say
they
be
sorry
for
it
,
and
the
like
,
as
be
usual
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
but
still
nobody
come
to
tell
me
their
thought
,
till
at
last
one
of
the
keeper
come
to
me
privately
,
and
say
with
a
sigh
,
"
well
,
Mrs.
Flanders
,
you
will
be
try
on
Friday
'
(
this
be
but
a
Wednesday
)
;
"
what
do
you
intend
to
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
turn
as
white
as
a
clout
,
and
say
,
"
God
know
what
I
shall
do
;
for
my
part
,
I
know
not
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
not
flatter
you
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
you
prepare
for
death
,
for
I
doubt
you
will
be
cast
;
and
as
they
say
you
be
an
old
offender
,
I
doubt
you
will
find
but
little
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
,
"
add
he
,
"
your
case
be
very
plain
,
and
that
the
witness
swear
so
home
against
you
,
there
will
be
no
stand
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
stab
into
the
very
vital
of
one
under
such
a
burthen
as
I
be
oppress
with
before
,
and
I
could
not
speak
to
him
a
word
,
good
or
bad
,
for
a
great
while
;
but
at
last
I
burst
out
into
tear
,
and
say
to
him
,
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
Mr.
#
#
#
#
,
 
<EOS>
what
must
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
!
"
say
he
,
"
send
for
the
ordinary
;
send
for
a
minister
and
talk
with
him
;
for
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Flanders
,
unless
you
have
very
good
friend
,
you
be
no
woman
for
this
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
plain
deal
indeed
,
but
it
be
very
harsh
to
me
,
at
least
I
think
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
me
in
the
great
confusion
imaginable
,
and
all
that
night
I
lie
awake
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
begin
to
say
my
prayer
,
which
I
have
scarce
do
before
since
my
last
husband
's
death
,
or
from
a
little
while
after
.
 
<EOS>
and
truly
I
may
well
call
it
<EOS>
say
my
prayer
,
for
I
be
in
such
a
confusion
,
and
have
such
horror
upon
my
mind
,
that
though
I
cry
,
and
repeat
several
time
the
ordinary
expression
of
"
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
<EOS>
"
I
never
bring
myself
to
any
sense
of
my
be
a
miserable
sinner
,
as
indeed
I
be
,
and
of
confess
my
sin
to
God
,
and
beg
pardon
for
the
sake
of
Jesus
Christ
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
overwhelmed
with
the
sense
of
my
condition
,
be
try
for
my
life
,
and
be
sure
to
be
condemn
,
and
then
I
be
as
sure
to
be
execute
,
and
on
this
account
I
cry
out
all
night
,
"
Lord
,
what
will
become
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
hang
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
My
poor
afflict
governess
be
now
as
much
concerned
as
I
,
and
<EOS>
a
great
deal
more
truly
penitent
,
though
she
have
no
prospect
of
be
bring
to
trial
and
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
not
but
that
she
deserve
it
as
much
as
I
,
and
<EOS>
so
she
say
herself
;
but
she
have
not
do
anything
herself
for
many
year
,
other
than
receive
what
I
and
other
stole
,
and
encourage
us
to
steal
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
cry
,
and
take
on
like
a
distracted
body
,
wring
her
hand
,
and
cry
out
that
she
be
undo
,
that
she
believe
there
be
a
curse
from
heaven
upon
her
,
that
she
should
be
damn
,
that
she
have
be
the
destruction
of
all
her
friend
,
that
she
have
bring
such
a
one
,
and
such
a
one
,
and
such
a
one
to
the
gallow
;
and
there
she
reckon
up
ten
or
eleven
people
,
some
of
which
I
have
give
account
of
,
that
come
to
untimely
end
;
and
that
now
she
be
the
occasion
of
my
ruin
,
for
she
have
persuade
me
to
go
on
,
when
I
would
have
leave
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
interrupt
her
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
mother
,
no
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
not
speak
of
that
,
for
you
would
have
have
me
leave
off
when
I
get
the
mercer
's
money
again
,
and
<EOS>
when
I
come
home
from
Harwich
,
and
I
would
not
hearken
to
you
;
therefore
you
have
not
be
to
blame
;
it
be
I
only
have
ruin
myself
,
I
have
bring
myself
to
this
misery
"
;
and
thus
we
spend
many
hour
together
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
no
remedy
;
the
prosecution
go
on
,
and
on
the
Thursday
I
be
carry
down
to
the
session
-
house
,
where
I
be
arraign
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
the
next
day
I
be
appoint
to
be
try
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
arraignment
I
plead
"
not
guilty
,
"
and
well
I
may
,
for
I
be
indict
for
felony
and
burglary
;
that
is
,
for
feloniously
steal
two
piece
of
brocaded
silk
,
value
#
#
#
#
46
,
the
good
of
Anthony
Johnson
,
and
for
break
open
his
door
;
whereas
I
know
very
well
they
could
not
pretend
to
prove
I
have
break
up
the
door
,
or
so
much
as
lift
up
a
latch
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
Friday
I
be
bring
to
my
trial
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
exhaust
my
spirit
with
cry
for
two
or
three
day
before
,
so
that
I
sleep
better
the
Thursday
night
than
I
expect
,
and
have
more
courage
for
my
trial
than
indeed
I
think
possible
for
me
to
have
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
trial
begin
,
the
indictment
be
read
,
I
would
have
speak
,
but
they
tell
me
the
witness
must
be
hear
first
,
and
then
I
should
have
time
to
be
hear
.
 
<EOS>
the
witness
be
the
two
wench
,
a
couple
of
hard
-
mouthed
jade
indeed
,
<EOS>
for
though
the
thing
be
truth
in
the
main
,
yet
they
aggravate
it
to
the
utmost
extremity
,
and
swear
I
have
the
good
wholly
in
my
possession
,
that
I
have
hide
them
among
my
clothe
,
that
I
be
go
off
with
them
,
that
I
have
one
foot
over
the
threshold
when
they
discover
themselves
,
and
then
I
put
t
'
other
over
,
so
that
I
be
quite
out
of
the
house
in
the
street
with
the
good
before
they
take
hold
of
me
,
and
then
they
seize
me
,
and
bring
me
back
again
,
and
they
take
the
good
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
in
general
be
all
true
,
but
I
believe
,
and
insist
upon
it
,
that
they
stop
me
before
I
have
set
my
foot
clear
of
the
threshold
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
do
not
argue
much
,
<EOS>
for
certain
it
be
that
I
have
take
the
good
,
and
I
be
bring
them
away
,
if
I
have
not
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
plead
that
I
have
steal
nothing
,
they
have
lose
nothing
,
that
the
door
be
open
,
and
I
go
in
,
see
the
good
lie
there
,
and
with
design
to
buy
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
see
nobody
in
the
house
,
I
have
take
any
of
them
up
in
my
hand
it
could
not
be
conclude
that
I
intend
to
steal
them
,
for
that
I
never
carry
them
farther
than
the
door
to
look
on
them
with
the
well
light
.
  
<EOS>
the
Court
would
not
allow
that
by
any
mean
,
and
make
a
kind
of
a
jest
of
my
intending
to
buy
the
good
,
that
be
no
shop
for
the
selling
of
anything
,
and
as
to
carry
them
to
the
door
to
look
at
them
,
the
maid
make
their
impudent
mock
upon
that
,
and
spend
their
wit
upon
it
very
much
;
tell
the
Court
I
have
look
at
them
sufficiently
,
and
approve
them
very
well
,
for
I
have
pack
them
up
under
my
clothe
,
and
be
a
-
go
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
find
guilty
of
felony
,
but
acquit
of
the
burglary
,
which
be
but
small
comfort
to
me
,
the
first
bring
me
to
a
sentence
of
death
,
and
the
last
would
have
do
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
be
carry
down
to
receive
the
dreadful
sentence
,
and
when
they
come
to
ask
me
what
I
have
to
say
why
sentence
should
not
pass
,
I
stand
mute
a
while
,
but
somebody
that
stand
behind
me
prompt
me
aloud
to
speak
to
the
judge
,
for
that
they
could
represent
thing
favourably
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
encourage
me
to
speak
,
and
I
tell
them
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
stop
the
sentence
,
but
that
I
have
much
to
say
to
bespeak
the
mercy
of
the
Court
;
that
I
hope
they
would
allow
something
in
such
a
case
for
the
circumstance
of
it
;
that
I
have
break
no
door
,
have
carry
nothing
off
;
that
nobody
have
lose
anything
;
that
the
person
whose
good
they
be
be
pleased
to
say
he
desire
mercy
may
be
show
(
which
indeed
he
very
honestly
do
)
;
that
,
at
the
bad
,
it
be
the
first
offence
,
and
that
I
have
never
be
before
any
court
of
justice
before
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
speak
with
more
courage
that
I
think
I
could
have
do
,
and
in
such
a
move
tone
,
and
though
with
tear
,
yet
not
so
many
tear
as
to
obstruct
my
speech
,
that
I
could
see
it
move
other
to
tear
that
hear
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
judge
sit
grave
and
mute
,
give
me
an
easy
hearing
,
and
time
to
say
all
that
I
would
,
but
,
say
neither
yes
<EOS>
nor
no
to
it
,
pronounce
the
sentence
of
death
upon
me
,
a
sentence
that
be
to
me
like
death
itself
,
which
,
after
it
be
read
,
confound
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
spirit
leave
in
me
,
I
have
no
tongue
to
speak
,
or
eye
to
look
up
either
to
God
or
man
.
  
<EOS>
My
poor
governess
be
utterly
disconsolate
,
and
she
that
be
my
comforter
before
,
want
comfort
now
herself
;
and
sometimes
mourn
,
sometimes
rage
,
be
as
much
out
of
herself
,
as
to
all
outward
appearance
,
as
any
mad
woman
in
Bedlam
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
she
only
disconsolate
as
to
me
,
but
she
be
strike
with
horror
at
the
sense
of
her
own
wicked
life
,
and
begin
to
look
back
upon
it
with
a
taste
quite
different
from
mine
,
for
she
be
penitent
to
the
high
degree
for
her
sin
,
as
well
as
sorrowful
for
the
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
She
send
for
a
minister
,
too
,
a
serious
,
pious
,
good
man
,
and
apply
herself
with
such
earnestness
,
by
his
assistance
,
to
the
work
of
a
sincere
repentance
,
that
I
believe
,
and
so
do
the
minister
too
,
that
she
be
a
true
penitent
;
and
,
which
be
still
more
<EOS>
,
she
be
not
only
so
for
the
occasion
,
and
at
that
juncture
,
but
she
continue
so
,
as
I
be
inform
,
to
the
day
of
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
rather
to
be
think
of
than
<EOS>
express
what
be
now
my
condition
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
before
me
but
present
death
;
and
as
I
have
no
friend
to
assist
me
,
or
to
stir
for
me
,
I
expect
nothing
but
to
find
my
name
in
the
dead
warrant
,
which
be
to
come
down
for
the
execution
,
the
Friday
afterwards
,
of
five
more
and
myself
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
my
poor
distressed
governess
send
me
a
minister
,
who
at
her
request
first
,
and
at
my
own
afterwards
,
come
to
visit
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
exhort
me
seriously
to
repent
of
all
my
sin
,
and
to
dally
no
longer
with
my
soul
;
not
flatter
myself
with
hope
of
life
,
which
,
he
say
,
he
be
inform
there
be
no
room
to
expect
,
but
unfeignedly
to
look
up
to
God
with
my
whole
soul
,
and
to
cry
for
pardon
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
.
 
<EOS>
He
back
his
discourse
with
proper
quotation
of
scripture
,
encourage
the
great
sinner
to
repent
,
and
turn
from
their
evil
way
,
and
when
he
have
do
,
he
kneel
down
and
pray
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
feel
any
real
sign
of
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
look
back
upon
my
past
life
with
abhorrence
,
and
have
a
kind
of
view
into
the
other
side
of
time
,
and
thing
of
life
,
as
I
believe
they
do
with
everybody
at
such
a
time
,
begin
to
look
with
a
different
aspect
,
and
quite
another
shape
,
than
they
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
and
good
thing
,
the
view
of
felicity
,
the
joy
,
the
griefs
of
life
,
be
quite
other
thing
;
and
I
have
nothing
in
my
thought
but
what
be
so
infinitely
superior
to
what
I
have
know
in
life
,
that
it
appear
to
me
to
be
the
great
stupidity
in
nature
to
lay
any
weight
upon
anything
,
though
the
most
valuable
in
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
eternity
represent
itself
with
all
its
incomprehensible
addition
,
and
I
have
such
extended
notion
of
it
,
that
I
know
not
how
to
express
them
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
how
vile
,
how
gross
,
how
absurd
do
every
pleasant
thing
look
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
that
we
have
count
pleasant
before
 
especially
when
I
reflect
that
these
sordid
trifle
be
the
thing
for
which
we
forfeit
eternal
felicity
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
reflection
come
,
of
mere
course
,
severe
reproach
of
my
own
mind
for
my
wretched
behaviour
in
my
past
life
;
that
I
have
forfeit
all
hope
of
any
happiness
in
the
eternity
that
I
be
just
go
to
enter
into
,
and
on
the
contrary
be
entitle
to
all
that
be
miserable
,
or
have
be
conceive
of
misery
;
and
all
this
with
the
frightful
addition
of
its
be
also
eternal
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
capable
of
read
lecture
of
instruction
to
anybody
,
but
I
relate
this
in
the
very
manner
in
which
thing
then
appear
to
me
,
as
far
as
I
be
able
,
but
infinitely
short
of
the
lively
impression
which
they
make
on
my
soul
at
that
time
;
indeed
,
those
impression
be
not
to
be
explain
by
word
,
or
if
they
be
,
I
be
not
mistress
of
word
enough
to
express
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
work
of
every
sober
reader
to
make
just
reflection
on
them
,
as
their
own
circumstance
may
direct
;
and
,
without
question
,
this
be
what
every
one
at
some
time
or
other
may
feel
something
of
;
I
mean
,
a
clear
sight
into
thing
to
come
than
they
have
here
,
and
a
dark
view
of
their
own
concern
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
go
back
to
my
own
case
.
 
<EOS>
the
minister
press
me
to
tell
him
,
as
far
as
I
though
convenient
,
in
what
state
<EOS>
I
find
myself
as
to
the
sight
I
have
of
thing
beyond
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
do
not
come
as
ordinary
of
the
place
,
whose
business
it
be
to
extort
confession
from
prisoner
,
for
private
end
,
or
for
the
further
detecting
of
other
offender
;
that
his
business
be
to
move
me
to
such
freedom
of
discourse
as
may
serve
to
disburthen
my
own
mind
,
and
furnish
him
to
administer
comfort
to
me
as
far
as
be
in
his
power
;
and
assure
me
,
that
whatever
I
say
to
him
should
remain
with
him
,
and
be
as
much
a
secret
as
if
it
be
know
only
to
God
and
myself
;
and
that
he
desire
to
know
nothing
of
me
,
but
as
above
to
qualify
him
to
apply
proper
advice
and
assistance
to
me
,
and
to
pray
to
God
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
this
honest
,
friendly
way
of
treat
me
unlock
all
the
sluice
of
my
passion
.
 
<EOS>
He
break
into
my
very
soul
by
it
;
and
I
unravel
all
the
wickedness
of
my
life
to
him
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
give
him
an
abridgment
of
this
whole
history
;
I
give
him
a
picture
of
my
conduct
for
fifty
year
in
miniature
.
  
<EOS>
I
hide
nothing
from
him
,
and
he
in
return
exhort
me
to
sincere
repentance
,
explain
to
me
what
he
mean
by
repentance
,
and
then
draw
out
such
a
scheme
of
infinite
mercy
,
proclaim
from
heaven
to
sinner
of
the
great
magnitude
,
that
he
leave
me
nothing
to
say
,
that
look
like
despair
,
or
doubt
of
be
accept
;
and
in
this
condition
he
leave
me
the
first
night
.
  
<EOS>
He
visit
me
again
the
next
morning
,
and
go
on
with
his
method
of
explain
the
term
of
divine
mercy
,
which
accord
to
him
consist
of
nothing
more
,
or
more
difficult
,
than
that
of
be
sincerely
desirous
of
it
,
and
willing
to
accept
it
;
only
a
sincere
regret
for
,
and
hatred
of
,
those
thing
I
have
do
,
which
render
me
so
just
an
object
of
divine
vengeance
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
able
to
repeat
the
excellent
discourse
of
this
extraordinary
man
;
'
tis
all
that
I
be
able
to
do
,
to
say
that
he
revive
my
heart
,
and
bring
me
into
such
a
condition
that
I
never
know
anything
of
in
my
life
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
cover
with
shame
and
tear
for
thing
past
,
and
yet
have
at
the
same
time
a
secret
surprising
joy
at
the
prospect
of
be
a
true
penitent
,
and
obtain
the
comfort
of
a
penitent
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
the
hope
of
be
forgive
;
and
so
swift
do
thought
circulate
,
and
so
high
do
the
impression
they
have
make
upon
me
run
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
I
could
freely
have
go
out
that
minute
to
execution
,
without
any
uneasiness
at
all
,
cast
my
soul
entirely
into
the
arm
of
infinite
mercy
as
a
penitent
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
gentleman
be
so
move
also
in
my
behalf
with
a
view
of
the
influence
which
he
see
these
thing
have
on
me
,
that
he
bless
God
he
have
come
to
visit
me
,
and
resolve
not
to
leave
me
till
the
last
moment
;
that
is
,
not
to
leave
visit
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
less
than
twelve
day
after
our
receive
sentence
before
any
be
order
for
execution
,
and
then
upon
a
Wednesday
the
dead
warrant
,
as
they
call
it
,
come
down
,
and
I
find
my
name
be
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
a
terrible
blow
<EOS>
this
be
to
my
new
resolution
;
indeed
my
heart
sink
within
me
,
and
I
swoon
away
twice
,
one
after
another
,
but
speak
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
the
good
minister
be
sorely
afflict
for
me
,
and
do
what
he
could
to
comfort
me
with
the
same
argument
,
and
the
same
moving
eloquence
that
he
do
before
,
and
leave
me
not
that
evening
so
long
as
the
prisonkeeper
would
suffer
him
to
stay
in
the
prison
,
unless
he
would
be
lock
up
with
me
all
night
,
which
he
be
not
willing
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
much
that
I
do
not
see
him
all
the
next
day
,
it
be
the
day
before
the
time
appoint
for
execution
;
and
I
be
greatly
discourage
,
and
deject
in
my
mind
,
and
indeed
almost
sink
for
want
of
the
comfort
which
he
have
so
often
,
and
with
such
success
,
yield
me
on
his
former
visit
.
 
<EOS>
I
wait
with
great
impatience
,
and
under
the
great
oppression
of
spirit
imaginable
,
till
about
four
o'clock
he
come
to
my
apartment
;
for
I
have
obtain
the
favour
,
by
the
help
of
money
,
nothing
be
to
be
do
in
that
place
without
it
,
not
to
be
keep
in
the
condemn
hole
,
as
they
call
it
,
among
the
rest
of
the
prisoner
who
be
to
die
,
but
to
have
a
little
dirty
chamber
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
leap
within
me
for
joy
when
I
hear
his
voice
at
the
door
,
even
before
I
see
him
;
but
let
any
one
judge
what
kind
of
motion
I
find
in
my
soul
,
when
after
have
make
a
short
excuse
for
his
not
come
,
he
show
me
that
his
time
have
be
employ
on
my
account
;
that
he
have
obtain
a
favourable
report
from
the
Recorder
to
the
Secretary
of
State
in
my
particular
case
,
and
,
in
short
,
that
he
have
bring
me
a
reprieve
.
  
<EOS>
He
use
all
the
caution
that
he
be
able
in
let
me
know
a
thing
which
it
would
have
be
a
double
cruelty
to
have
conceal
;
and
yet
it
be
too
much
for
me
;
for
as
grief
have
overset
me
before
,
so
do
joy
overset
me
now
,
and
I
fall
into
a
much
more
dangerous
swooning
than
I
do
at
first
,
and
it
be
not
without
a
great
difficulty
that
I
be
recover
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
man
have
make
a
very
christian
exhortation
to
me
,
not
to
let
the
joy
of
my
reprieve
put
the
remembrance
of
my
past
sorrow
out
of
my
mind
,
and
have
tell
me
that
he
must
leave
me
,
to
go
and
enter
the
reprieve
in
the
book
,
and
show
it
to
the
sheriff
,
stand
up
just
before
his
go
away
,
and
in
a
very
earnest
manner
pray
to
God
for
me
,
that
my
repentance
may
be
make
unfeigned
and
sincere
;
and
that
my
come
back
,
as
it
be
,
into
life
again
,
may
not
be
a
return
to
the
folly
of
life
which
I
have
make
such
solemn
resolution
to
forsake
,
and
to
repent
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
join
heartily
in
the
petition
,
and
must
need
say
I
have
deep
impression
upon
my
mind
all
that
night
,
of
the
mercy
of
God
in
spare
my
life
,
and
a
great
detestation
of
my
past
sin
,
from
a
sense
of
the
goodness
which
I
have
taste
in
this
case
,
than
I
have
in
all
my
sorrow
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
may
be
think
inconsistent
in
itself
,
and
wide
from
the
business
of
this
book
;
particularly
,
I
reflect
that
many
of
those
who
may
be
please
and
divert
with
the
relation
of
the
wild
and
wicked
part
of
my
story
may
not
relish
this
,
which
be
really
the
good
part
of
my
life
,
the
most
advantageous
to
myself
,
and
the
most
instructive
to
other
.
 
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
will
,
I
hope
,
allow
me
the
liberty
to
make
my
story
complete
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
severe
satire
on
such
to
say
they
do
not
relish
the
repentance
as
much
as
they
do
the
crime
;
and
that
they
have
rather
the
history
be
a
complete
tragedy
,
as
it
be
very
likely
to
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
go
on
with
my
relation
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
there
be
a
sad
scene
indeed
in
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
be
salute
with
in
the
morning
be
the
tolling
of
the
great
bell
at
St.
Sepulchre
's
,
as
they
call
it
,
which
usher
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
it
begin
to
toll
,
a
dismal
groaning
and
crying
be
hear
from
the
condemn
hole
,
where
there
lie
six
poor
soul
who
be
to
be
execute
that
day
,
some
from
one
crime
,
some
for
another
,
and
two
of
them
for
murder
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
follow
by
a
confused
clamour
in
the
house
,
among
the
several
sort
of
prisoner
,
express
their
awkward
sorrow
for
the
poor
creature
that
be
to
die
,
but
in
a
manner
extremely
differ
one
from
another
.
 
<EOS>
some
cry
for
them
;
some
huzzae
,
and
wish
them
a
good
journey
;
some
damned
and
curse
those
that
have
bring
them
to
it
 
that
is
,
mean
the
evidence
,
or
prosecutor
 
<EOS>
many
pity
them
,
and
some
few
,
but
very
few
,
pray
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
room
for
so
much
composure
of
mind
as
be
require
for
me
to
bless
the
merciful
Providence
that
have
,
as
it
be
,
snatch
me
out
of
the
jaw
of
this
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
I
remain
,
as
it
be
,
dumb
and
silent
,
<EOS>
overcome
with
the
sense
of
it
,
and
not
able
to
express
what
I
have
in
my
heart
;
for
the
passion
on
such
occasion
as
these
be
certainly
so
agitated
as
not
to
be
able
presently
to
regulate
their
own
motion
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
while
the
poor
condemn
creature
be
prepare
to
their
death
,
and
the
ordinary
,
as
they
call
him
,
be
busy
with
them
,
dispose
them
to
submit
to
their
sentence
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
all
this
while
I
be
seize
with
a
fit
of
tremble
,
as
much
as
I
could
have
be
if
I
have
be
in
the
same
condition
,
as
to
be
sure
the
day
before
I
expect
to
be
;
I
be
so
violently
agitate
by
this
surprising
fit
,
that
I
shake
as
if
it
have
be
in
the
cold
fit
of
an
ague
,
so
that
I
could
not
speak
or
look
<EOS>
but
like
one
distract
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
all
put
into
cart
and
go
,
which
,
however
,
I
have
not
courage
enough
to
see
 
I
say
,
as
soon
as
they
be
go
,
I
fall
into
a
fit
of
cry
involuntarily
,
and
without
design
,
but
as
a
mere
distemper
,
and
yet
so
violent
,
and
it
hold
me
so
long
,
that
I
know
not
what
course
to
take
,
nor
could
I
stop
,
or
put
a
check
to
it
,
no
,
not
with
all
the
strength
and
courage
I
have
.
  
<EOS>
this
fit
of
crying
hold
me
near
two
hour
,
and
,
as
I
believe
,
hold
me
till
they
be
all
out
of
the
world
,
and
then
a
most
humble
,
penitent
,
serious
kind
of
joy
succeed
;
a
real
transport
it
be
,
or
passion
of
joy
and
thankfulness
,
but
still
unable
to
give
vent
to
it
by
word
,
and
in
this
I
continue
most
part
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
the
good
minister
visit
me
again
,
and
then
fall
to
his
usual
good
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
He
congratulate
my
have
a
space
yet
allow
me
for
repentance
,
whereas
the
state
of
those
six
poor
creature
be
determine
,
and
they
be
now
past
the
offer
of
salvation
;
he
earnestly
press
me
to
retain
the
same
sentiment
of
the
thing
of
life
that
I
have
when
I
have
a
view
of
eternity
;
and
at
the
end
of
all
tell
me
I
should
not
conclude
that
all
be
over
,
that
a
reprieve
be
not
a
pardon
,
that
he
could
not
yet
answer
for
the
effect
of
it
;
however
,
I
have
this
mercy
,
that
I
have
more
time
give
me
,
and
that
it
be
my
business
to
improve
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
this
discourse
,
though
very
seasonable
,
leave
a
kind
of
sadness
on
my
 
heart
,
as
if
I
may
expect
the
affair
would
have
a
tragical
issue
still
,
which
,
however
,
he
have
no
certainty
of
;
and
I
do
not
indeed
,
at
that
time
,
question
him
about
it
,
he
have
say
that
he
would
do
his
utmost
to
bring
it
to
a
good
end
,
and
that
he
hope
he
may
,
but
he
would
not
have
me
be
secure
;
and
the
consequence
prove
that
he
have
reason
for
what
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
a
fortnight
after
this
that
I
have
some
just
apprehension
that
I
should
be
include
in
the
next
dead
warrant
at
the
ensue
session
;
and
it
be
not
without
great
difficulty
,
and
at
last
a
humble
petition
for
transportation
,
that
I
avoid
it
,
so
ill
be
I
behold
to
fame
,
and
<EOS>
so
prevail
be
the
fatal
report
of
be
an
old
offender
;
though
in
that
they
do
not
do
me
strict
justice
,
for
I
be
not
in
the
sense
of
the
law
an
old
offender
,
<EOS>
whatever
I
be
in
the
eye
of
the
judge
,
for
I
have
never
be
before
them
in
a
judicial
way
before
;
so
the
judge
could
not
charge
me
with
be
an
old
offender
,
but
the
Recorder
be
pleased
to
represent
my
case
as
he
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
a
certainty
of
life
indeed
,
but
with
the
hard
condition
of
be
order
for
transportation
,
which
indeed
be
hard
condition
in
itself
,
but
not
when
comparatively
consider
;
and
therefore
I
shall
make
no
comment
upon
the
sentence
,
nor
upon
the
choice
I
be
put
to
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
all
choose
anything
rather
than
death
,
especially
when
'
tis
attend
with
an
uncomfortable
prospect
beyond
it
,
which
be
my
case
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
minister
,
whose
interest
,
though
a
stranger
to
me
,
have
obtain
me
the
reprieve
,
mourn
sincerely
for
this
part
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
hope
,
he
say
,
that
I
should
have
end
my
day
under
the
influence
of
good
instruction
,
that
I
should
not
have
be
turn
loose
again
among
such
a
wretched
crew
as
they
generally
be
,
who
be
thus
send
abroad
,
where
,
as
he
say
,
I
must
have
more
than
ordinary
secret
assistance
from
the
grace
of
God
,
if
I
do
not
turn
as
wicked
again
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
for
a
good
while
mention
my
governess
,
who
have
during
most
,
if
not
all
,
of
this
part
be
dangerously
sick
,
and
be
in
as
near
a
view
of
death
by
her
disease
as
I
be
by
my
sentence
,
be
a
great
penitent
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
have
not
mention
her
,
nor
indeed
do
I
see
her
in
all
this
time
;
but
be
now
recover
,
and
just
able
to
come
abroad
,
she
come
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
my
condition
,
and
what
a
different
flux
and
reflux
of
tear
and
hope
I
have
be
agitate
with
;
I
tell
her
what
I
have
escape
,
and
upon
what
term
;
and
she
be
present
when
the
minister
express
his
fear
of
my
relapse
into
wickedness
upon
my
falling
into
the
wretched
company
that
be
generally
transport
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
a
melancholy
reflection
upon
it
in
my
own
mind
,
for
I
know
what
a
dreadful
gang
be
always
send
away
together
,
and
I
say
to
my
governess
that
the
good
minister
's
fear
be
not
without
cause
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
 
she
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
you
will
not
be
tempt
with
such
a
horrid
example
as
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
the
minister
be
go
,
she
tell
me
she
would
not
have
me
discourage
,
for
perhaps
way
and
mean
may
be
find
out
to
dispose
of
me
in
a
particular
way
,
by
myself
,
of
which
she
would
talk
further
to
me
afterward
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
earnestly
at
her
,
and
I
think
she
look
more
cheerful
than
she
usually
have
do
,
and
I
entertain
immediately
a
thousand
notion
of
be
deliver
,
but
could
not
for
my
life
image
the
method
,
or
think
of
one
that
be
in
the
least
feasible
;
but
I
be
too
much
concerned
in
it
to
let
her
go
from
me
without
explain
herself
,
which
,
though
she
be
very
loth
to
do
,
yet
my
importunity
prevail
,
and
,
<EOS>
while
I
be
still
press
,
she
answer
me
in
a
few
word
,
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
have
money
,
have
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
know
one
in
your
life
that
be
transport
and
have
a
hundred
pound
in
his
pocket
,
I
will
warrant
you
,
child
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
I
understand
her
presently
,
but
tell
her
I
would
leave
all
that
to
her
,
but
I
see
no
room
to
hope
for
anything
but
a
strict
execution
of
the
order
,
and
as
it
be
a
severity
that
be
esteem
a
mercy
,
there
be
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
strictly
observe
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
no
more
but
this
:
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
try
what
can
be
do
,
"
and
so
we
part
for
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
lie
in
the
prison
near
fifteen
week
after
this
order
for
transportation
be
sign
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
reason
of
it
be
,
I
know
not
,
but
at
the
end
of
this
time
I
be
put
on
board
of
a
ship
in
the
Thames
,
and
with
me
a
gang
of
thirteen
as
harden
vile
creature
as
ever
Newgate
produce
in
my
time
;
and
it
would
really
well
take
up
a
history
longer
than
mine
to
describe
the
degree
of
impudence
and
audacious
villainy
that
those
thirteen
be
arrive
to
,
and
the
manner
of
their
behaviour
in
the
voyage
;
of
which
I
have
a
very
diverting
account
by
me
,
which
the
captain
of
the
ship
who
carry
them
over
give
me
the
minute
of
,
and
which
he
cause
his
mate
to
write
down
at
large
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
be
think
trifle
to
enter
here
into
a
relation
of
all
the
little
incident
which
attend
me
in
this
interval
of
my
circumstance
;
I
mean
,
between
the
final
order
of
my
transportation
and
the
time
of
my
go
on
board
the
ship
;
and
I
be
too
near
the
end
of
my
story
to
allow
room
for
it
;
but
something
relate
to
me
and
my
Lancashire
husband
<EOS>
I
must
not
omit
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
,
as
I
have
observe
already
,
be
carry
from
the
master
's
side
of
the
ordinary
prison
into
the
press
-
yard
,
with
three
of
his
comrade
,
for
they
find
another
to
add
to
them
after
some
time
;
here
,
for
what
reason
I
know
not
,
they
be
keep
in
custody
without
be
bring
to
trial
almost
three
month
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
they
find
mean
to
bribe
or
buy
off
some
of
those
who
be
expect
to
come
in
against
them
,
and
they
want
evidence
for
some
time
to
convict
them
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
puzzle
on
this
account
,
at
first
they
make
a
shift
to
get
proof
enough
against
two
of
them
to
carry
them
off
;
but
the
other
two
,
of
which
my
Lancashire
husband
be
one
,
lie
still
in
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
,
I
think
,
one
positive
evidence
against
each
of
them
,
but
the
law
strictly
oblige
them
to
have
two
witness
,
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
yet
it
seem
they
be
resolve
not
to
part
with
the
man
neither
,
not
doubt
but
a
further
evidence
would
at
last
come
in
;
and
in
order
to
this
,
I
think
publication
be
make
,
that
such
prisoner
be
take
,
any
one
that
have
be
rob
by
them
may
come
to
the
prison
and
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
this
opportunity
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
,
pretend
that
I
have
be
rob
in
the
dunstable
coach
,
and
that
I
would
go
to
see
the
two
highwayman
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
into
the
press
-
yard
,
I
so
disguise
myself
,
and
muffle
my
face
up
so
,
that
he
could
see
little
of
me
,
and
consequently
know
nothing
of
who
I
be
;
and
<EOS>
when
I
come
back
,
I
say
publicly
that
I
know
them
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
it
be
rumour
all
over
the
prison
that
Moll
Flanders
would
turn
evidence
against
one
of
the
highwayman
,
and
that
I
be
to
come
off
by
it
from
the
sentence
of
transportation
.
  
<EOS>
They
hear
of
it
,
and
immediately
my
husband
desire
to
see
this
Mrs.
Flanders
that
know
him
so
well
,
and
be
to
be
an
evidence
against
him
;
and
accordingly
I
have
leave
give
to
go
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
dress
myself
up
as
well
as
the
good
clothe
that
I
suffer
myself
ever
to
appear
in
there
<EOS>
would
allow
me
,
and
go
to
the
press
-
yard
,
but
have
for
some
time
a
hood
over
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
little
to
me
at
first
,
but
ask
me
if
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
yes
,
very
well
;
but
as
I
conceal
my
face
,
so
I
counterfeit
my
voice
,
that
he
have
not
the
least
guess
at
who
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
me
where
I
have
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
between
Dunstable
and
Brickhill
;
but
turn
to
the
keeper
that
stand
by
,
I
ask
if
I
may
not
be
admit
to
talk
with
him
alone
.
<EOS>
He
say
yes
,
yes
,
as
much
as
I
please
,
and
so
very
civilly
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
go
,
I
have
shut
the
door
,
I
throw
off
my
hood
,
and
burst
out
into
tear
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
do
you
not
know
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
turn
pale
,
and
stand
speechless
,
like
one
thunderstruck
,
and
,
not
able
to
conquer
the
surprise
,
say
no
more
but
this
,
"
let
me
sit
down
"
;
and
sit
down
by
a
table
,
he
lay
his
elbow
upon
the
table
,
and
lean
his
head
on
his
hand
,
fix
his
eye
on
the
ground
as
one
stupid
.
 
<EOS>
I
cry
so
vehemently
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
it
be
a
good
<EOS>
while
ere
<EOS>
I
could
speak
any
more
;
but
after
I
have
give
some
vent
to
my
passion
by
tear
,
I
repeat
the
same
word
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
do
you
not
know
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
he
answer
,
yes
,
and
say
no
more
a
good
while
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
time
continue
in
the
surprise
,
as
above
,
he
cast
up
his
eye
towards
me
and
say
,
"
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
readily
understand
what
he
mean
;
and
I
answer
,
"
how
can
you
call
me
cruel
?
 
<EOS>
what
have
I
be
cruel
to
you
in
?
"
<EOS>
"
to
come
to
me
,
"
say
he
,
"
in
such
a
place
as
this
,
be
it
not
to
insult
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
rob
you
,
at
least
not
on
the
highway
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
perceive
by
this
that
he
know
nothing
of
the
miserable
circumstance
I
be
in
,
and
think
that
,
have
get
some
intelligence
of
his
be
there
,
I
have
come
to
upbraid
him
with
his
leave
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
too
much
to
say
to
him
to
be
affront
,
and
tell
him
in
few
word
,
that
I
be
far
from
come
to
insult
him
,
but
at
best
I
come
to
condole
mutually
;
that
he
would
be
easily
satisfied
that
I
have
no
such
view
,
when
I
should
tell
him
that
my
condition
be
bad
than
his
,
and
that
many
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
a
little
concerned
at
the
general
expression
of
my
condition
be
bad
than
his
,
but
,
with
a
kind
smile
,
look
a
little
wildly
,
and
say
,
"
how
can
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
when
you
see
me
fetter
,
and
in
Newgate
,
and
two
of
my
companion
execute
already
,
can
you
can
your
condition
be
bad
than
mine
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
we
have
a
long
piece
of
work
to
do
,
if
I
should
be
to
relate
,
or
you
to
hear
,
my
unfortunate
history
;
but
if
you
be
disposed
to
hear
it
,
you
will
soon
conclude
with
me
that
my
condition
be
bad
than
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
that
possible
,
"
say
he
again
,
"
when
I
expect
to
be
cast
for
my
life
the
very
next
session
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
"
'
tis
very
possible
,
when
I
shall
tell
you
that
I
have
be
cast
for
my
life
three
session
ago
,
and
be
under
sentence
of
death
;
be
not
my
case
bad
than
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
then
indeed
,
he
stand
silent
again
,
like
one
strike
dumb
,
and
after
a
while
he
start
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
unhappy
couple
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
this
be
possible
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
take
him
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
sit
down
,
and
let
us
compare
our
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
prisoner
in
this
very
house
,
and
in
much
bad
circumstance
than
you
,
and
you
will
be
satisfied
<EOS>
I
do
not
come
to
insult
you
,
when
I
tell
you
the
particular
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
any
with
this
we
sit
down
together
,
and
I
tell
him
so
much
of
my
story
as
I
think
be
convenient
,
bring
it
at
last
to
my
be
reduce
to
great
poverty
,
and
represent
myself
as
fall
into
some
company
that
lead
me
to
relieve
my
distress
by
way
that
I
have
be
utterly
unacquainted
with
,
and
that
they
make
an
attempt
at
a
tradesman
's
house
<EOS>
,
I
be
seize
upon
for
have
be
but
just
at
the
door
,
the
maid
-
servant
pull
me
in
;
that
I
neither
have
break
any
lock
nor
take
anything
away
,
and
that
notwithstanding
that
,
I
be
bring
in
guilty
and
sentence
to
die
;
but
that
the
judge
,
have
be
make
sensible
of
the
hardship
of
my
circumstance
,
have
obtain
leave
to
remit
the
sentence
upon
my
consenting
to
be
transport
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
fare
the
bad
for
be
take
in
the
prison
for
one
Moll
Flanders
,
who
be
a
famous
successful
thief
,
that
all
of
them
have
hear
of
,
but
none
of
them
have
ever
see
;
but
that
,
as
he
know
well
,
be
none
of
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
place
all
to
the
account
of
my
ill
fortune
,
and
that
under
this
name
I
be
deal
with
as
an
old
offender
,
though
this
be
the
first
thing
they
have
ever
know
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
long
particular
of
thing
that
have
befall
me
since
I
see
him
,
but
I
tell
him
if
I
have
see
him
since
he
may
think
I
have
,
and
then
give
him
an
account
how
I
have
see
him
at
Brickhill
;
how
furiously
he
be
pursue
,
and
how
,
by
give
an
account
that
I
know
him
,
and
that
he
be
a
very
honest
gentleman
,
one
Mr.

#

,
 
the
hue
-
and
-
cry
be
stop
,
and
the
high
constable
go
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
listen
most
attentively
to
all
my
story
,
and
smile
at
most
of
the
particular
,
be
all
of
them
petty
matter
,
and
infinitely
below
what
he
have
be
at
the
head
of
;
but
when
I
come
to
the
story
of
Brickhill
,
he
be
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
be
it
you
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
give
the
check
to
the
mob
that
be
at
our
heel
there
,
at
Brickhill
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I
,
<EOS>
"
it
be
I
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
tell
him
the
particular
which
I
have
observe
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
you
that
save
my
life
at
that
time
,
and
I
be
glad
I
owe
my
life
to
you
,
for
I
will
pay
the
debt
to
you
now
,
and
I
will
deliver
you
from
the
present
condition
you
be
in
,
or
I
will
die
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
by
no
mean
;
it
be
a
risk
too
great
,
not
worth
his
run
the
hazard
of
,
and
for
a
life
not
worth
his
saving
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
no
matter
for
that
,
he
say
,
it
be
a
life
worth
all
the
world
to
him
;
a
life
that
have
give
him
a
new
life
;
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
never
in
real
danger
of
be
take
,
but
<EOS>
that
time
,
till
the
last
minute
when
I
be
take
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
tell
me
his
danger
then
lie
in
his
believing
he
have
not
be
pursue
that
way
;
for
they
have
go
from
Hockey
quite
another
way
,
and
have
come
over
the
enclose
country
into
Brickhill
,
not
by
the
road
,
and
be
sure
they
have
not
be
see
by
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
here
he
give
me
a
long
history
of
his
life
,
which
indeed
would
make
a
very
strange
history
,
and
be
infinitely
divert
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
take
to
the
road
about
twelve
year
before
he
marry
me
;
that
the
woman
which
call
him
brother
be
not
really
his
sister
,
or
any
kin
to
him
,
but
one
that
belong
to
their
gang
,
and
who
,
keep
correspondence
with
him
,
live
always
in
town
,
have
good
store
of
acquaintance
;
that
she
give
them
a
perfect
intelligence
of
person
go
out
of
town
,
and
that
they
have
make
several
good
bootie
by
her
correspondence
;
that
she
think
she
have
fix
a
fortune
for
him
when
she
bring
me
to
him
,
but
happen
to
be
disappoint
,
which
he
really
could
not
blame
her
for
;
that
if
it
have
be
his
good
luck
that
I
have
have
the
estate
,
which
she
be
inform
I
have
,
he
have
resolve
to
leave
off
the
road
and
live
a
retired
,
sober
live
but
never
to
appear
in
public
till
some
general
pardon
have
be
pass
,
or
till
he
could
,
for
money
,
have
get
his
name
into
some
particular
pardon
,
that
so
he
may
have
be
perfectly
easy
;
but
that
,
as
it
have
prove
otherwise
,
he
be
oblige
to
put
off
his
equipage
and
take
up
the
old
trade
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
a
long
account
of
some
of
his
adventure
,
and
particularly
one
when
he
rob
the
West
Chester
coach
near
Lichfield
,
when
he
get
a
very
great
booty
;
and
after
that
,
how
he
rob
five
grazier
,
in
the
west
,
go
to
Burford
Fair
in
Wiltshire
to
buy
sheep
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
get
so
much
money
on
those
two
occasion
,
that
if
he
have
know
where
to
have
find
me
,
he
would
certainly
have
embrace
my
proposal
of
go
with
me
to
Virginia
,
or
to
have
settle
in
a
plantation
on
some
other
part
of
the
english
colony
in
America
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
write
two
or
three
letter
to
me
,
direct
accord
to
my
order
,
but
hear
nothing
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
indeed
know
to
be
true
,
but
the
letter
come
to
my
hand
in
the
time
of
my
latter
husband
,
I
could
do
nothing
in
it
,
and
therefore
choose
to
give
no
answer
,
that
so
he
may
rather
believe
they
have
miscarry
.
  
<EOS>
be
thus
disappoint
,
he
say
,
he
carry
on
the
old
trade
ever
since
,
though
when
he
have
get
so
much
money
,
he
say
,
he
do
not
run
such
desperate
risk
as
he
do
before
.
<EOS>
then
he
give
me
some
account
of
several
hard
and
desperate
encounter
which
he
have
with
gentleman
on
the
road
,
who
part
too
hardly
with
their
money
,
and
show
me
some
wound
he
have
receive
;
and
he
have
one
or
two
very
terrible
wound
indeed
,
as
particularly
one
by
a
pistol
bullet
,
which
break
his
arm
,
and
another
with
a
sword
,
which
run
him
quite
through
the
body
,
but
that
miss
his
vital
,
he
be
cure
again
;
one
of
his
comrade
have
keep
with
him
so
faithfully
,
and
so
friendly
,
as
that
he
assist
him
in
ride
near
eighty
mile
before
his
arm
be
set
,
and
then
get
a
surgeon
in
a
considerable
city
,
remote
from
that
place
where
it
be
do
,
pretend
they
be
gentleman
travel
towards
Carlisle
and
that
they
have
be
attack
on
the
road
by
highwayman
,
and
that
one
of
them
have
shoot
him
into
the
arm
and
break
the
bone
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
he
say
,
his
friend
manage
so
well
,
that
they
be
not
suspect
at
all
,
but
lie
still
till
he
be
perfectly
cure
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
so
many
distinct
account
of
his
adventure
,
that
it
be
with
great
reluctance
that
I
decline
the
relate
them
;
but
I
consider
that
this
be
my
own
story
,
not
his
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
inquire
into
the
circumstance
of
his
present
case
at
that
time
,
and
what
it
be
he
expect
when
he
come
to
be
try
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
they
have
no
evidence
against
him
,
or
but
very
little
;
for
that
of
three
robbery
,
which
they
be
all
charge
with
,
it
be
his
good
fortune
that
he
be
<EOS>
but
in
one
of
them
,
and
that
there
be
but
one
witness
to
be
have
for
that
fact
,
which
be
not
sufficient
,
but
that
it
be
expect
some
other
would
come
in
against
him
;
that
he
think
indeed
,
when
he
first
see
me
,
that
I
have
be
one
that
come
of
that
errand
;
but
that
if
somebody
come
in
against
him
,
he
hope
he
should
be
clear
;
that
he
have
have
some
intimation
,
that
if
he
would
submit
to
transport
himself
,
he
may
be
admit
to
it
without
a
trial
,
but
that
he
could
not
think
of
it
with
any
temper
,
and
think
he
could
much
easy
submit
to
be
hang
.
  
<EOS>
I
blame
him
for
that
,
and
tell
him
I
blame
him
on
two
account
;
first
,
because
if
he
be
transport
,
there
may
be
a
hundred
way
for
him
that
be
a
gentleman
,
and
a
bold
enterprising
man
,
to
find
his
way
back
again
,
and
perhaps
some
way
and
mean
to
come
back
before
he
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
smile
at
that
part
,
and
say
he
should
like
the
last
the
good
of
the
two
,
for
he
have
a
kind
of
horror
upon
his
mind
at
his
be
send
over
to
the
plantation
,
as
Romans
send
condemn
slave
to
work
in
the
mine
;
that
he
think
the
passage
into
another
state
,
let
it
be
what
it
would
,
much
more
tolerable
at
the
gallow
,
and
that
this
be
the
general
notion
of
all
the
gentleman
who
be
drive
by
the
exigence
of
their
fortune
to
take
the
road
;
that
at
the
place
of
execution
there
be
at
least
an
end
of
all
the
misery
of
the
present
state
,
and
as
for
what
be
to
follow
,
a
man
be
,
in
his
opinion
,
as
likely
to
repent
sincerely
in
the
last
fortnight
of
his
life
,
under
the
pressure
and
agony
of
a
jail
and
the
condemn
hole
,
as
he
would
ever
be
in
the
wood
and
wilderness
of
America
;
that
servitude
and
hard
labour
be
thing
gentleman
could
never
stoop
to
;
that
it
be
but
<EOS>
the
way
to
force
them
to
be
their
own
executioner
afterwards
,
which
be
much
bad
;
and
that
therefore
he
could
not
have
any
patience
when
he
do
but
think
of
be
transport
.
  
<EOS>
I
use
the
utmost
of
my
endeavour
to
persuade
him
,
and
join
that
know
woman
's
rhetoric
to
it
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
that
of
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
infamy
of
a
public
execution
be
certainly
a
great
pressure
upon
the
spirit
of
a
gentleman
than
any
of
the
mortification
that
he
could
meet
with
abroad
could
be
;
that
he
have
at
least
in
the
other
a
chance
for
his
life
,
whereas
here
he
have
none
at
all
;
that
it
be
the
easy
thing
in
the
world
for
him
to
manage
the
captain
of
a
ship
,
who
be
,
generally
speak
,
man
of
good
-
humour
and
some
gallantry
;
and
a
small
matter
of
conduct
,
especially
if
there
be
any
money
to
be
have
,
would
make
way
for
him
to
buy
himself
off
when
he
come
to
Virginia
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
wistfully
at
me
,
and
I
think
I
guess
at
what
he
mean
,
that
be
to
say
,
that
he
have
no
money
;
but
I
be
mistaken
,
his
meaning
be
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
hint
just
now
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
there
may
be
a
way
of
come
back
before
I
go
,
by
which
I
understand
you
that
it
may
be
possible
to
buy
it
off
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
rather
give
#
#
#
#
200
to
prevent
go
,
than
#
#
#
#
100
to
be
set
at
liberty
when
I
come
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
is
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
because
you
do
not
know
the
place
so
well
as
I
do
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
,
"
say
he
;
"
and
yet
I
believe
,
as
well
as
you
know
it
,
you
would
do
the
same
,
unless
it
be
because
,
as
you
tell
me
,
you
have
a
mother
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
as
to
my
mother
,
it
be
next
to
impossible
but
that
she
must
be
dead
many
year
before
;
and
as
for
any
other
relation
that
I
may
have
there
,
I
know
them
not
now
;
that
since
the
misfortune
I
have
be
under
have
reduce
me
to
the
condition
I
have
be
in
for
some
year
,
I
have
not
keep
up
any
correspondence
with
them
;
and
that
he
would
easily
believe
,
I
should
find
but
a
cold
reception
from
them
if
I
should
be
put
to
make
my
first
visit
in
the
condition
of
a
transport
felon
;
that
therefore
,
if
I
go
thither
,
I
resolve
not
to
see
them
;
but
that
I
have
many
view
in
go
there
,
if
it
should
be
my
fate
,
which
take
off
all
the
uneasy
part
of
it
;
and
if
he
find
himself
oblige
to
go
also
,
I
should
easily
instruct
him
how
to
manage
himself
,
so
as
never
to
go
a
servant
at
all
,
especially
since
I
find
he
be
not
destitute
of
money
,
which
be
the
only
friend
in
such
a
condition
.
  
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
say
he
do
not
tell
me
he
have
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
him
up
short
,
and
tell
him
I
hope
he
do
not
understand
by
my
speaking
,
that
I
should
expect
any
supply
from
him
if
he
have
money
;
that
,
on
the
other
hand
,
though
I
have
not
a
great
deal
,
yet
I
do
not
want
,
and
while
I
have
any
I
would
rather
add
to
him
than
weaken
him
in
that
article
,
see
,
whatever
he
have
,
I
know
in
the
case
of
transportation
he
would
have
occasion
of
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
He
express
himself
in
a
most
tender
manner
upon
that
head
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
what
money
he
have
be
not
a
great
deal
,
but
that
he
would
never
hide
any
of
it
from
me
if
I
want
it
,
and
that
he
assure
me
he
do
not
speak
with
any
such
apprehension
;
that
he
be
only
intent
upon
what
I
have
hint
to
him
before
he
go
;
that
here
he
know
what
to
do
with
himself
,
but
that
there
he
should
be
the
most
ignorant
,
helpless
wretch
alive
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
fright
and
terrify
himself
with
that
which
have
no
terror
in
it
;
that
if
he
have
money
,
as
I
be
glad
to
hear
he
have
,
he
may
not
only
avoid
the
servitude
suppose
to
be
the
consequence
of
transportation
,
but
begin
the
world
upon
a
new
foundation
,
and
that
such
a
one
as
he
could
not
fail
of
success
in
,
with
the
common
application
usual
in
such
case
;
that
he
could
not
but
call
to
mind
that
be
be
what
I
have
recommend
to
him
many
year
before
and
have
propose
it
for
our
mutual
subsistence
and
restore
our
fortune
in
the
world
;
and
I
would
tell
him
now
,
that
to
convince
him
both
of
the
certainty
of
it
and
of
my
be
fully
acquaint
with
the
method
,
and
also
fully
satisfied
in
the
probability
of
success
,
he
should
first
see
me
deliver
myself
from
the
necessity
of
go
over
at
all
,
and
then
that
I
would
go
with
him
freely
,
and
of
my
own
choice
,
and
perhaps
carry
enough
with
me
to
satisfy
him
that
I
do
not
offer
it
for
want
of
be
able
to
live
without
assistance
from
him
,
but
that
I
think
our
mutual
misfortune
have
be
such
as
be
sufficient
to
reconcile
us
both
to
quit
this
part
of
the
world
,
and
live
where
nobody
could
upbraid
us
with
what
be
past
,
or
we
be
in
any
dread
of
a
prison
,
and
without
agony
of
a
condemn
hole
to
drive
us
to
it
;
this
where
we
should
look
back
on
all
our
past
disaster
with
infinite
satisfaction
,
when
we
should
consider
that
our
enemy
should
entirely
forget
us
,
and
that
we
should
live
as
new
people
in
a
new
world
,
nobody
have
anything
to
say
to
us
,
or
we
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
press
this
home
to
him
with
so
many
argument
,
and
answer
all
his
own
passionate
objection
so
effectually
that
he
embrace
me
,
and
tell
me
I
treat
him
with
such
sincerity
and
affection
as
overcome
him
;
that
he
would
take
my
advice
,
and
would
strive
to
submit
to
his
fate
in
hope
of
have
the
comfort
of
my
assistance
,
and
of
so
faithful
a
counsellor
and
such
a
companion
in
his
misery
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
he
put
me
in
mind
of
what
I
have
mention
before
,
namely
,
that
there
may
be
some
way
to
get
off
before
he
go
,
and
that
it
may
be
possible
to
avoid
go
at
all
,
which
he
say
would
be
much
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
should
see
,
and
be
fully
satisfied
,
that
I
would
do
my
utmost
in
that
part
too
,
and
if
it
do
not
succeed
,
yet
that
I
would
make
good
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
We
part
after
this
long
conference
with
such
testimony
of
kindness
and
affection
as
I
think
be
equal
,
if
not
superior
,
to
that
at
our
parting
at
Dunstable
;
and
now
I
see
more
plainly
than
before
,
the
reason
why
he
decline
come
at
that
time
any
farther
with
me
toward
London
than
Dunstable
,
and
why
,
when
we
part
there
,
he
tell
me
it
be
not
convenient
for
him
to
come
part
of
the
way
to
London
to
bring
me
go
,
as
he
would
otherwise
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
observe
that
the
account
of
his
life
would
have
make
a
much
more
pleasing
history
than
this
of
mine
;
and
,
indeed
,
nothing
in
it
be
more
strange
than
this
part
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
he
carry
on
that
desperate
trade
full
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
and
have
never
be
take
,
the
success
he
have
meet
with
have
be
so
very
uncommon
,
and
such
that
sometimes
he
have
live
handsomely
,
and
retire
in
place
for
a
year
or
two
at
a
time
,
keep
himself
and
a
man
-
servant
to
wait
on
him
,
and
have
often
sit
in
the
coffee
-
house
and
hear
the
very
people
whom
he
have
rob
give
account
of
their
be
rob
,
and
of
the
place
and
circumstance
,
so
that
he
could
easily
remember
that
it
be
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
it
seem
,
he
live
near
Liverpool
at
the
time
he
unluckily
marry
me
for
a
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
be
the
fortune
he
expect
,
I
verily
believe
,
as
he
say
,
that
he
would
have
take
up
and
live
honestly
all
his
day
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
with
the
rest
of
his
misfortune
the
good
luck
not
to
be
actually
upon
the
spot
when
the
robbery
be
do
which
he
be
commit
for
,
and
so
none
of
the
person
rob
could
swear
to
him
,
or
have
anything
to
charge
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
as
he
be
take
with
the
gang
,
one
hard
-
mouthed
countryman
swear
home
to
him
,
and
they
be
like
to
have
other
come
in
accord
to
the
publication
they
have
make
;
so
that
they
expect
more
evidence
against
him
,
and
for
that
reason
he
be
keep
in
hold
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
offer
which
be
make
to
him
of
admit
him
to
transportation
be
make
,
as
I
understand
,
upon
the
intercession
of
some
great
person
who
press
him
hard
to
accept
of
it
before
a
trial
;
and
indeed
,
as
he
know
there
be
several
that
may
come
in
against
him
,
I
think
his
friend
be
in
the
right
,
and
I
lie
at
him
night
and
day
to
delay
it
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
with
much
difficulty
,
he
give
his
consent
;
and
as
he
be
not
therefore
admit
to
transportation
in
court
,
and
on
his
petition
,
as
I
be
,
so
he
find
himself
under
a
difficulty
to
avoid
embark
himself
as
I
have
say
he
may
have
do
;
his
great
friend
,
who
be
his
intercessor
for
the
favour
of
that
grant
,
have
give
security
for
him
that
he
should
transport
himself
,
and
not
return
within
the
term
.
  
<EOS>
this
hardship
break
all
my
measure
,
for
the
step
I
take
afterwards
for
my
own
deliverance
<EOS>
be
hereby
render
wholly
ineffectual
,
unless
I
would
abandon
him
,
and
leave
him
to
go
to
America
by
himself
;
than
which
he
protest
he
would
much
rather
venture
,
although
he
be
certain
to
go
directly
to
the
gallow
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
now
return
to
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
of
my
be
transport
accord
to
my
sentence
be
near
at
hand
;
my
governess
,
who
continue
my
fast
friend
,
have
try
to
obtain
a
pardon
,
but
it
could
not
be
do
unless
with
an
expense
too
heavy
for
my
purse
,
consider
that
to
be
leave
naked
and
empty
,
unless
I
have
resolve
to
return
to
my
old
trade
again
,
have
be
bad
than
my
transportation
,
because
there
I
know
I
could
live
,
here
I
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
minister
stand
very
hard
on
another
account
to
prevent
my
being
transport
also
;
but
he
be
answer
,
that
indeed
my
life
have
be
give
me
at
his
first
solicitation
,
and
therefore
he
ought
to
ask
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
be
sensibly
grieve
at
my
going
,
because
,
as
he
say
,
he
fear
I
should
lose
the
good
impression
which
a
prospect
of
death
have
at
first
make
on
me
,
and
which
be
since
increase
by
his
instruction
;
and
the
pious
gentleman
be
exceedingly
concerned
about
me
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
I
really
be
not
so
solicitous
about
it
as
I
be
before
,
but
I
industriously
conceal
my
reason
for
it
from
the
minister
,
and
to
the
last
he
do
not
know
but
<EOS>
that
I
go
with
the
utmost
reluctance
and
affliction
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
month
of
February
that
I
be
,
with
seven
other
convict
,
as
they
call
us
,
deliver
to
a
merchant
that
trade
to
Virginia
,
on
board
a
ship
,
ride
,
as
they
call
it
,
in
Deptford
Reach
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
of
the
prison
deliver
us
on
board
,
and
the
master
of
the
vessel
give
a
discharge
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
for
that
night
clap
under
hatch
,
and
keep
so
close
that
I
think
I
should
have
be
suffocate
for
want
of
air
;
and
the
next
morning
the
ship
weigh
,
and
fall
down
the
river
to
a
place
they
call
Bugby
's
Hole
,
which
be
do
,
as
they
tell
us
,
by
the
agreement
of
the
merchant
,
that
all
opportunity
of
escape
should
be
take
from
us
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
when
the
ship
come
thither
and
cast
anchor
,
we
be
allow
more
liberty
,
and
particularly
be
permit
to
come
up
on
the
deck
,
but
not
up
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
that
be
keep
particularly
for
the
captain
and
for
passenger
.
  
<EOS>
when
by
the
noise
of
the
man
over
my
head
,
and
the
motion
of
the
ship
,
I
perceive
that
they
be
under
sail
,
I
be
at
first
greatly
surprised
,
fear
we
should
go
away
directly
,
and
that
our
friend
would
not
be
admit
to
see
us
any
more
;
but
I
be
easy
soon
after
,
when
I
find
they
have
come
to
an
anchor
again
,
and
soon
after
that
we
have
notice
give
by
some
of
the
man
where
we
be
,
that
the
next
morning
we
should
have
the
liberty
to
come
up
on
deck
,
and
to
have
our
friend
come
and
see
us
if
we
have
any
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
night
I
lie
upon
the
hard
board
of
the
deck
,
as
the
passenger
do
,
but
we
have
afterwards
the
liberty
of
little
cabin
for
such
of
us
as
have
any
bedding
to
lay
in
them
,
and
room
to
stow
any
box
or
trunk
for
clothe
and
linen
,
if
we
have
it
(
which
may
well
be
put
in
)
,
for
some
of
them
have
neither
shirt
nor
shift
or
a
rag
of
linen
or
woollen
,
but
what
be
on
their
back
,
or
a
farthing
of
money
to
help
themselves
;
and
yet
I
do
not
find
<EOS>
but
they
fare
well
enough
in
the
ship
,
especially
the
woman
,
who
get
money
from
the
seaman
for
wash
their
clothe
,
sufficient
to
 
purchase
any
common
thing
that
they
want
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
next
morning
we
have
the
liberty
to
come
up
on
the
deck
,
I
ask
one
of
the
officer
of
the
ship
,
whether
I
may
not
have
the
liberty
to
send
a
letter
on
shore
,
to
let
my
friend
know
where
the
ship
lie
,
and
to
get
some
necessary
thing
send
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
it
seem
,
the
boatswain
,
a
very
civil
,
courteous
sort
of
man
,
who
tell
me
I
should
have
that
,
or
any
other
liberty
that
I
desire
,
that
he
could
allow
me
with
safety
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
desire
no
other
;
and
he
answer
that
the
ship
's
boat
would
go
up
to
London
the
next
tide
,
and
he
would
order
my
letter
to
be
carry
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
the
boat
go
off
,
the
boatswain
come
to
me
and
tell
me
the
boat
be
go
off
,
and
that
he
go
in
it
himself
,
and
ask
me
if
my
letter
be
ready
he
would
take
care
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
prepare
myself
,
you
may
be
sure
,
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
beforehand
,
and
I
have
get
a
letter
ready
direct
to
my
governess
,
and
enclose
another
for
my
fellow
-
prisoner
,
which
,
however
,
I
do
not
let
her
know
<EOS>
be
my
husband
,
not
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
to
my
governess
,
I
let
her
know
where
the
ship
lie
,
and
press
her
earnestly
to
send
me
<EOS>
what
thing
I
know
she
have
get
ready
for
me
for
my
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
give
the
boatswain
the
letter
,
I
give
him
a
shilling
with
it
,
which
I
tell
him
be
for
the
charge
of
a
messenger
or
porter
,
which
I
entreat
him
to
send
with
the
letter
as
soon
as
he
come
on
shore
,
that
if
possible
I
may
have
an
answer
bring
back
by
the
same
hand
,
that
I
may
know
what
be
become
of
my
thing
;
"
for
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
the
ship
should
go
away
before
I
have
them
on
board
,
I
be
undone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
take
care
,
when
I
give
him
the
shilling
,
to
let
him
see
that
I
have
a
little
well
furniture
about
me
than
the
ordinary
prisoner
,
for
he
see
that
I
have
a
purse
,
and
in
it
a
pretty
deal
of
money
;
and
I
find
that
the
very
sight
of
it
immediately
furnish
me
with
very
different
treatment
from
what
I
should
otherwise
have
meet
with
in
the
ship
;
for
though
he
be
very
courteous
indeed
before
,
in
a
kind
of
natural
compassion
to
me
,
as
a
woman
in
distress
,
yet
he
be
more
than
ordinarily
so
afterwards
,
and
procure
me
to
be
better
treat
in
the
ship
than
,
I
say
,
I
may
otherwise
have
be
;
as
shall
appear
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
He
very
honestly
have
my
letter
deliver
to
my
governess
's
own
hand
,
and
bring
me
back
an
answer
from
her
in
writing
;
and
when
he
give
me
the
answer
,
give
me
the
shilling
again
.
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
your
shilling
again
too
,
for
I
deliver
the
letter
myself
.
"
 
I
could
not
tell
what
to
say
,
I
be
so
surprised
at
the
thing
;
but
after
some
pause
,
I
say
,
"
Sir
,
you
be
too
kind
;
it
have
be
but
reasonable
that
you
have
pay
yourself
coach
-
hire
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
overpay
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
gentlewoman
?
<EOS>
Your
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
she
be
no
relation
to
me
,
but
she
be
a
dear
friend
,
and
all
the
friend
I
have
in
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
few
such
friend
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
she
cry
after
you
like
a
child
,
"
 
"
ay
,
"
say
I
again
,
"
she
would
give
a
hundred
pound
,
I
believe
,
to
deliver
me
from
this
dreadful
condition
I
be
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
she
so
?
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
half
the
money
I
believe
I
could
put
you
in
a
way
how
to
deliver
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
this
he
speak
softly
,
that
nobody
could
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
<EOS>
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
but
then
that
must
be
such
a
deliverance
as
,
if
I
should
be
take
again
,
would
cost
me
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
be
once
out
of
the
ship
,
you
must
look
to
yourself
afterwards
;
that
I
can
say
nothing
to
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
we
drop
the
discourse
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
my
governess
,
faithful
to
the
last
moment
,
convey
my
letter
to
the
prison
to
my
husband
,
and
get
an
answer
to
it
,
and
the
next
day
come
down
herself
to
the
ship
,
bring
me
,
in
the
first
place
,
a
sea
-
bed
as
they
call
it
,
and
all
its
furniture
,
such
as
be
convenient
,
but
not
to
let
the
people
think
it
be
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
She
bring
with
her
a
sea
-
chest
 
that
is
,
a
chest
,
such
as
be
make
for
seaman
,
with
all
the
convenience
in
it
,
and
fill
with
everything
almost
that
I
could
want
;
and
in
one
of
the
corner
of
the
chest
,
where
there
be
a
private
drawer
,
be
my
bank
of
money
 
<EOS>
this
be
to
say
,
so
much
of
it
as
I
have
resolve
to
carry
with
me
;
for
I
order
a
part
of
my
stock
to
be
leave
behind
me
,
to
be
send
afterwards
in
such
good
as
I
should
want
when
I
come
to
settle
;
for
money
in
that
country
be
not
of
much
use
where
all
thing
be
bring
for
tobacco
,
much
more
be
it
a
great
loss
to
carry
it
from
hence
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
case
be
particular
;
it
be
by
no
means
proper
to
me
to
go
thither
without
money
or
good
,
and
for
a
poor
convict
,
that
be
to
be
sell
as
soon
as
I
come
on
shore
,
to
carry
with
me
a
cargo
of
good
would
be
to
have
notice
take
of
it
,
and
perhaps
to
have
them
seize
by
the
public
;
so
I
take
part
of
my
stock
with
me
thus
,
and
leave
the
other
part
with
my
governess
.
  
<EOS>
My
governess
bring
me
a
great
many
other
thing
,
but
it
be
not
proper
for
me
to
look
too
well
provide
in
the
ship
,
at
least
till
I
know
what
kind
of
a
captain
we
should
have
.
<EOS>
when
she
come
into
the
ship
,
I
think
she
would
have
die
indeed
;
her
heart
sink
at
the
sight
of
me
,
and
at
the
thought
of
part
with
me
in
that
condition
,
and
she
cry
so
intolerably
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
for
a
long
time
have
any
talk
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
that
time
to
read
my
fellow
-
prisoner
's
letter
,
which
,
however
,
greatly
perplex
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
be
determined
to
go
,
but
find
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
be
discharge
time
enough
for
go
in
the
same
ship
,
and
which
be
more
than
all
,
he
begin
to
question
whether
they
would
give
him
leave
to
go
in
<EOS>
what
ship
he
please
,
though
he
do
voluntarily
transport
himself
;
but
that
they
would
see
him
put
on
board
such
a
ship
as
they
should
direct
,
and
that
he
would
be
charge
upon
the
captain
as
other
convict
prisoner
be
;
so
that
he
begin
to
be
in
despair
of
see
me
till
he
come
to
Virginia
,
which
make
him
almost
desperate
;
see
that
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
I
should
not
be
there
,
if
any
accident
of
the
sea
or
of
mortality
should
take
me
away
,
he
should
be
the
most
undone
creature
there
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
perplexing
,
and
I
know
not
what
course
to
take
.
<EOS>
I
tell
my
governess
the
story
of
the
boatswain
,
and
she
be
mighty
eager
with
me
treat
with
him
;
but
I
have
no
mind
to
it
,
till
I
hear
whether
my
husband
,
or
fellow
-
prisoner
,
so
she
call
him
,
could
be
at
liberty
to
go
with
me
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
be
force
to
let
her
into
the
whole
matter
,
except
only
that
of
his
be
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
have
make
a
positive
bargain
or
agreement
with
him
to
go
,
if
he
could
get
the
liberty
of
go
in
the
same
ship
,
and
that
I
find
he
have
money
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
read
a
long
lecture
to
her
of
what
I
propose
to
do
when
we
come
there
,
how
we
could
plant
,
settle
,
and
,
in
short
,
grow
rich
without
any
more
adventure
;
and
,
as
a
great
secret
,
I
tell
her
that
we
be
to
marry
as
soon
as
he
come
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
She
soon
agree
cheerfully
to
my
going
when
she
hear
this
,
and
she
make
it
her
business
from
that
time
to
get
him
out
of
the
prison
in
time
,
so
that
he
may
go
in
the
same
ship
with
me
,
which
at
last
be
bring
to
pass
,
though
with
great
difficulty
,
and
not
without
all
the
form
of
a
transported
prisoner
-
convict
,
which
he
really
be
not
yet
,
for
he
have
not
be
try
,
and
which
be
a
great
mortification
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
our
fate
be
now
determine
,
and
we
be
both
on
board
,
actually
bind
to
Virginia
,
in
the
despicable
quality
of
transport
convict
destine
to
be
sell
for
slave
,
I
for
five
year
,
and
he
under
bond
and
security
not
to
return
to
England
any
more
,
as
long
as
he
live
,
he
be
very
much
dejected
and
cast
down
;
the
mortification
of
be
bring
on
board
,
as
he
be
,
like
a
prisoner
,
pique
him
very
much
,
since
it
be
first
tell
him
he
should
transport
himself
,
and
so
that
he
may
go
as
a
gentleman
at
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
he
be
not
order
to
be
sell
when
he
come
there
,
as
we
be
,
and
for
that
reason
he
be
oblige
to
pay
for
his
passage
to
the
captain
,
which
we
be
not
;
as
to
the
rest
,
he
be
as
much
at
a
loss
as
a
child
what
to
do
with
himself
,
or
with
what
he
have
,
but
by
direction
.
  
<EOS>
Our
first
business
be
to
compare
our
stock
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
honest
to
me
,
and
tell
me
his
stock
be
pretty
good
when
he
come
into
the
prison
,
but
the
living
there
as
he
do
in
a
figure
like
a
gentleman
,
and
,
which
be
ten
time
as
much
,
the
making
of
friend
,
and
solicit
his
case
,
have
be
very
expensive
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
his
stock
that
he
have
leave
be
#
#
#
#
108
,
which
he
have
about
him
all
in
gold
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
him
an
account
of
my
stock
as
faithfully
,
that
be
to
say
,
of
what
I
have
take
to
carry
with
me
,
for
I
be
resolve
,
whatever
should
happen
,
to
keep
what
I
have
leave
with
my
governess
in
reserve
;
that
in
case
I
should
die
,
what
I
have
with
me
be
enough
to
give
him
,
and
that
which
be
leave
in
my
governess
's
hand
would
be
her
own
,
<EOS>
which
she
have
well
deserved
of
me
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
My
stock
which
I
have
with
me
be
#
#
#
#
246
some
odd
shilling
;
so
that
we
have
#
#
#
#
354
between
us
,
but
a
worse
get
estate
be
scarce
ever
put
together
to
be
the
world
with
.
  
<EOS>
Our
great
misfortune
as
to
our
stock
be
that
it
be
all
in
money
,
which
every
one
know
be
an
unprofitable
cargo
to
be
carry
to
the
plantation
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
his
be
really
all
he
have
leave
in
the
world
,
as
he
tell
me
it
be
;
but
I
,
who
have
between
#
#
#
#
700
and
#
#
#
#
800
in
bank
when
this
disaster
befall
me
,
and
who
have
one
of
the
faithfull
friend
in
the
world
to
manage
it
for
me
,
consider
she
be
a
woman
of
manner
of
religious
principle
,
have
still
#
#
#
#
300
leave
in
her
hand
,
which
I
reserve
as
above
;
besides
,
some
very
valuable
thing
,
as
particularly
two
gold
watch
,
some
small
piece
of
plate
,
and
some
ring
 
all
steal
good
.
 
<EOS>
the
plate
,
ring
,
and
watch
be
put
in
my
chest
with
the
money
,
and
with
this
fortune
,
and
in
the
sixty
-
first
year
of
my
age
,
I
launch
out
into
a
new
world
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
in
the
condition
(
as
to
what
appear
)
only
of
a
poor
,
naked
convict
,
order
to
be
transport
in
respite
from
the
gallow
.
 
<EOS>
My
clothe
be
poor
and
mean
,
but
not
ragged
or
dirty
,
and
none
know
in
the
whole
ship
that
I
have
anything
of
value
about
me
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
have
a
great
many
very
good
clothe
and
linen
in
abundance
,
which
I
have
order
to
be
pack
up
in
two
great
box
,
I
have
them
ship
on
board
,
not
as
my
good
,
but
as
consign
to
my
real
name
in
Virginia
;
and
have
the
bill
of
loading
sign
by
a
captain
in
my
pocket
;
and
in
these
box
be
my
plate
and
watch
,
and
everything
of
value
except
my
money
,
which
I
keep
by
itself
in
a
private
drawer
in
my
chest
,
which
could
not
be
find
,
or
open
,
if
find
,
with
split
the
chest
to
piece
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
I
lie
for
three
week
in
the
ship
,
not
know
whether
I
should
have
my
husband
with
me
or
no
,
and
therefore
not
resolve
how
or
in
what
manner
to
receive
the
honest
boatswain
's
proposal
,
which
indeed
he
think
a
little
strange
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
this
time
,
behold
my
husband
come
on
board
.
<EOS>
He
look
with
a
dejected
,
angry
countenance
,
his
great
heart
be
swell
with
rage
and
disdain
;
to
be
drag
along
with
three
keeper
of
Newgate
,
and
put
on
board
like
a
convict
,
when
he
have
not
so
much
as
be
bring
to
a
trial
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
loud
complaint
of
it
by
his
friend
,
for
it
seem
he
have
some
interest
;
but
his
friend
get
some
check
in
their
application
,
and
be
tell
he
have
have
favour
enough
,
and
that
they
have
receive
such
an
account
of
him
,
since
the
last
grant
of
his
transportation
,
that
he
ought
to
think
himself
very
well
treat
that
he
be
not
prosecute
anew
.
 
<EOS>
this
answer
quiet
him
at
once
,
for
he
know
too
much
what
may
have
happen
,
and
what
he
have
room
to
expect
;
and
now
he
see
the
goodness
of
the
advice
to
him
,
which
prevail
with
him
to
accept
of
the
offer
of
a
voluntary
transportation
.
 
<EOS>
and
after
this
his
chagrin
at
these
hell
-
hound
,
as
he
call
them
,
be
a
little
over
,
he
look
a
little
composed
,
begin
to
be
cheerful
,
and
as
I
be
tell
him
how
glad
I
be
to
have
him
once
more
out
of
their
hand
,
he
take
me
in
his
arm
,
and
acknowledge
with
great
tenderness
that
I
have
give
him
the
good
advice
possible
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
thou
have
twice
save
my
life
;
from
henceforward
it
shall
be
all
employ
for
you
,
and
I
will
always
take
your
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
ship
begin
now
to
fill
;
several
passenger
come
on
board
,
who
be
embark
on
no
criminal
account
,
and
these
have
accommodation
assign
them
in
the
great
cabin
,
and
other
part
of
the
ship
,
whereas
we
,
as
convict
,
be
thrust
down
below
,
I
know
not
where
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
my
husband
come
on
board
,
I
speak
to
the
boatswain
,
<EOS>
who
have
so
early
give
me
hint
of
his
friendship
in
carry
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
he
have
befriend
me
in
many
thing
,
and
I
have
not
make
any
suitable
return
to
him
,
and
with
that
I
put
a
guinea
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
my
husband
be
now
come
on
board
;
that
though
we
be
both
under
the
present
misfortune
,
yet
we
have
be
person
of
a
different
character
from
the
wretched
crew
that
we
come
with
,
and
desire
to
know
of
him
,
whether
the
captain
may
not
be
move
to
admit
us
to
some
convenience
in
the
ship
,
for
which
we
would
make
him
what
satisfaction
he
please
,
and
that
we
would
gratify
him
for
his
pain
in
procure
this
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
guinea
,
as
I
could
see
,
with
great
satisfaction
,
and
assure
me
of
his
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
tell
us
he
do
not
doubt
but
that
the
captain
,
who
be
one
of
the
best
-
humour
gentleman
in
the
world
,
would
be
easily
bring
to
accommodate
us
as
well
as
we
could
desire
,
and
,
to
make
me
easy
,
tell
me
he
would
go
up
the
next
tide
on
purpose
to
speak
to
the
captain
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
happen
to
sleep
a
little
longer
than
ordinary
,
when
I
get
up
,
and
begin
to
look
abroad
,
I
see
the
boatswain
among
the
man
in
his
ordinary
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
melancholy
at
see
him
there
,
and
go
forward
to
speak
to
him
,
he
see
me
,
and
come
towards
me
,
but
not
give
him
time
to
speak
first
,
I
say
,
smile
,
"
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
sir
,
you
have
forget
us
,
for
I
see
you
be
very
busy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
return
presently
,
"
come
along
with
me
,
and
you
shall
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
he
take
me
into
the
great
cabin
,
and
there
sit
a
good
sort
of
a
gentlemanly
man
for
a
seaman
,
writing
,
and
with
a
great
many
paper
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
"
say
the
boatswain
to
him
that
be
a
-
writing
,
"
be
the
gentlewoman
that
the
captain

to
you
of

;
and
turn
to
me
,
he
say
,
"
I
have
be
so
far
from
forget
your
business
,
that
I
have
be
up

and
have
represent
faithfully

say
,

and
the

,
on

and
bid

but
with
the
same
respect
as

passenger

.
"
  
<EOS>
the
mate
then
speak
to
me
,
and
,
not
give
me
time
to
thank
the
boatswain
for
his
kindness
,
confirm
what
the
boatswain
have
say
,
and
add
that
it
be
the
captain
's
delight
to
show
himself
kind
and
charitable
,
especially
to
those
that
be
under
any
misfortune
,
and
with
that
he
show
me
several
cabin
build
up
,
some
in
the
great
cabin
,
and
some
partition
off
,
out
of
the
steerage
,
but
open
into
the
great
cabin
on
purpose
for
the
accommodation
of
passenger
,
and
give
me
leave
to
choose
where
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
choose
a
cabin
which
open
into
the
steerage
,
in
which
be
very
good
convenience
to
set
our
chest
and
box
,
and
a
table
to
eat
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
mate
then
tell
me
that
the
boatswain
have
give
so
good
a
character
of
me
and
my
husband
,
as
to
our
civil
behaviour
,
that
he
have
order
to
tell
me
we
should
eat
with
him
,
if
we
think
fit
,
during
the
whole
voyage
,
on
the
common
term
of
passenger
;
that
we
may
lay
in
some
fresh
provision
,
if
we
please
;
or
if
not
,
he
should
lay
in
his
usual
store
,
and
we
should
have
share
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
revive
news
to
me
,
after
so
many
hardship
and
affliction
as
I
have
go
through
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
,
and
tell
him
the
captain
should
make
his
own
term
with
us
,
and
ask
him
leave
to
go
and
tell
my
husband
of
it
,
who
be
not
very
well
,
and
be
not
yet
out
of
his
cabin
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
I
go
,
and
my
husband
,
whose
spirit
be
still
so
much
sink
with
the
indignity
(
as
he
understand
it
)
offer
him
,
that
he
be
scare
yet
himself
,
be
so
revive
with
the
account
that
I
give
him
of
the
reception
we
be
like
to
have
in
the
ship
,
that
he
be
quite
another
man
,
and
new
vigour
and
courage
appear
in
his
very
countenance
.
<EOS>
so
true
be
it
,
that
the
great
of
spirit
,
when
overwhelm
by
their
affliction
,
be
subject
to
the
great
dejection
,
and
be
the
most
apt
to
despair
and
give
themselves
up
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
little
pause
to
recover
himself
,
my
husband
come
up
with
me
,
and
give
the
mate
thank
for
the
kindness
,
which
he
have
express
to
us
,
and
send
suitable
acknowledgment
by
him
to
the
captain
,
offer
to
pay
him
by
advance
,
whatever
he
demand
for
our
passage
,
and
for
the
convenience
he
have
help
us
to
.
 
<EOS>
the
mate
tell
him
that
the
captain
would
be
on
board
in
the
afternoon
,
and
that
he
would
leave
all
that
till
he
come
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
in
the
afternoon
the
captain
come
,
and
we
find
him
the
same
courteous
,
obliging
man
that
the
boatswain
have
represent
him
to
be
;
and
he
be
so
well
pleased
with
my
husband
's
conversation
,
that
,
in
short
,
he
would
not
let
us
keep
the
cabin
we
have
choose
,
but
give
us
one
that
,
as
I
say
before
,
open
into
the
great
cabin
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
his
condition
exorbitant
,
or
the
man
craving
and
eager
to
make
a
prey
of
us
,
but
for
fifteen
guinea
we
have
our
whole
passage
and
provision
and
cabin
,
eat
at
the
captain
's
table
,
and
be
very
handsomely
entertain
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
lie
himself
in
the
other
part
of
the
great
cabin
,
have
let
his
round
house
,
as
they
call
it
,
to
a
rich
planter
who
go
over
with
his
wife
and
three
child
,
who
eat
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
some
other
ordinary
passenger
,
who
quarter
in
the
steerage
,
and
as
for
our
old
fraternity
,
they
be
keep
under
the
hatch
while
the
ship
lie
there
,
and
come
very
little
on
the
deck
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
refrain
acquaint
my
governess
with
what
have
happen
;
it
be
but
just
that
she
,
who
be
so
really
concerned
for
me
,
should
have
part
in
my
good
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
want
her
assistance
to
supply
me
with
several
necessary
,
which
before
I
be
shy
of
let
anybody
see
me
have
,
that
it
may
not
be
public
;
but
now
I
have
a
cabin
and
room
to
set
thing
in
<EOS>
,
I
order
abundance
of
good
thing
for
our
comfort
in
the
voyage
,
as
brandy
,
sugar
,
lemon
,
etc
.
,
to
make
punch
,
and
treat
our
benefactor
,
the
captain
;
and
abundance
of
thing
for
eat
and
drink
in
the
voyage
;
also
a
large
bed
,
and
bed
proportion
to
it
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
we
resolve
to
want
for
nothing
in
the
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
I
have
provide
nothing
for
our
assistance
when
we
should
come
to
the
place
and
begin
to
call
ourselves
planter
;
and
I
be
far
from
be
ignorant
of
what
be
needful
on
that
occasion
;
particularly
all
sort
of
tool
for
the
planter
's
work
,
and
for
building
;
and
all
kind
of
furniture
for
our
dwelling
,
which
,
if
to
be
buy
in
the
country
,
must
necessarily
cost
double
the
price
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
discourse
that
point
with
my
governess
,
and
she
go
and
wait
upon
the
captain
,
and
tell
him
that
she
hope
way
may
be
find
out
for
her
two
unfortunate
cousin
,
as
she
call
us
,
to
obtain
our
freedom
when
we
come
into
the
country
,
and
so
enter
into
a
discourse
with
him
about
the
mean
and
term
also
,
of
which
I
shall
say
more
in
its
place
;
and
after
thus
sound
the
captain
,
she
let
him
know
,
though
we
be
unhappy
in
the
circumstance
that
occasion
our
going
,
yet
that
we
be
not
unfurnished
to
set
ourselves
to
work
in
the
country
,
and
we
resolve
to
settle
and
live
there
as
planter
,
if
we
may
be
put
in
a
way
how
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
readily
offer
his
assistance
,
tell
her
the
method
of
enter
upon
such
business
,
and
how
easy
,
nay
,
how
certain
it
be
for
industrious
people
to
recover
their
fortune
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
'
tis
no
reproach
to
any
many
in
that
country
to
have
be
send
over
in
bad
circumstance
than
I
perceive
<EOS>
your
cousin
be
in
,
provide
they
do
but
apply
with
diligence
and
good
judgment
to
the
business
of
that
place
when
they
come
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
inquire
of
him
<EOS>
what
thing
it
be
necessary
we
should
carry
over
with
us
,
and
he
,
like
a
very
honest
as
well
as
know
man
,
tell
her
thus
:
 
"
Madam
,
your
cousin
in
the
first
place
must
procure
somebody
to
buy
them
as
servant
,
in
conformity
to
the
condition
of
their
transportation
,
and
then
,
in
the
name
of
that
person
,
they
may
go
about
what
they
will
;
they
may
either
purchase
some
plantation
already
begin
,
or
they
may
purchase
land
of
the
Government
of
the
country
,
and
begin
where
they
please
,
and
both
will
be
do
reasonably
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
bespeak
his
favour
in
the
first
article
,
which
he
promise
to
her
to
take
upon
himself
,
and
indeed
faithfully
perform
it
,
and
as
to
the
rest
,
he
promise
to
recommend
us
to
such
as
should
give
us
the
good
advice
,
and
not
to
impose
upon
us
,
which
be
as
much
as
could
be
desire
.
  
<EOS>
She
then
ask
him
if
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
furnish
us
with
a
stock
of
tool
and
material
for
the
business
of
planting
,
and
he
say
,
"
yes
,
by
all
mean
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
beg
his
assistance
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
him
she
would
furnish
us
with
everything
that
be
convenient
whatever
it
cost
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
accordingly
give
her
a
long
particular
of
thing
necessary
for
a
planter
,
which
,
by
his
account
,
come
to
about
fourscore
or
a
hundred
pound
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
in
short
,
she
go
about
as
dexterously
to
buy
them
,
as
if
she
have
be
an
old
Virginia
merchant
;
only
that
she
buy
,
by
my
direction
,
above
twice
as
much
of
everything
as
he
have
give
her
a
list
of
.
  
<EOS>
these
she
put
on
board
in
her
own
name
,
take
his
bill
of
load
for
them
,
and
endorse
those
bill
of
loading
to
my
husband
,
insure
the
cargo
afterwards
in
her
own
name
,
by
our
order
;
so
that
we
be
provide
for
all
event
,
and
for
all
disaster
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
tell
you
that
my
husband
give
her
all
his
whole
stock
of
#
#
#
#
108
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
he
have
about
him
in
gold
,
to
lay
out
thus
,
and
I
give
her
a
good
sum
besides
;
so
that
I
do
not
break
into
the
stock
which
I
have
leave
in
her
hand
at
all
,
but
after
we
have
sort
out
our
whole
cargo
,
we
have
yet
near
#
#
#
#
200
in
money
,
which
be
more
than
enough
for
our
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
,
very
cheerful
,
and
indeed
joyful
at
be
so
happily
accommodate
as
we
be
,
we
set
sail
from
Bugby
's
Hole
to
gravesend
,
where
the
ship
lie
about
ten
more
day
,
and
where
the
captain
come
on
board
for
good
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
captain
offer
us
a
civility
,
which
indeed
we
have
no
reason
to
expect
,
namely
,
to
let
us
go
on
shore
and
refresh
ourselves
,
upon
give
our
word
in
a
solemn
manner
that
we
would
not
go
from
him
,
and
that
we
would
return
peaceably
on
board
again
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
such
an
evidence
of
his
confidence
in
us
,
that
it
overcome
my
husband
,
who
,
in
a
mere
principle
of
gratitude
,
tell
him
,
as
he
could
not
be
in
any
capacity
to
make
a
suitable
return
for
such
a
favour
,
so
he
could
not
think
of
accept
of
it
,
nor
could
he
be
easy
that
the
captain
should
run
such
a
risk
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
mutual
civility
,
I
give
my
husband
a
purse
,
in
which
be
eighty
guinea
,
and
he
put
in
into
the
captain
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
,
captain
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
part
of
a
pledge
for
our
fidelity
;
if
we
deal
dishonestly
with
you
on
any
account
,
'
tis
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
on
this
we
go
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
captain
have
assurance
enough
of
our
resolution
to
go
,
for
that
have
make
such
provision
to
settle
there
,
it
do
not
seem
rational
that
we
would
choose
to
remain
here
at
the
expense
and
peril
of
life
,
for
such
it
must
have
be
if
we
have
be
take
again
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
go
all
on
shore
with
the
captain
,
and
sup
together
in
Gravesend
,
where
we
be
very
merry
,
stay
all
night
,
lie
at
the
house
where
we
sup
,
and
come
all
very
honestly
on
board
again
with
him
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
here
we
buy
ten
dozen
bottle
of
good
beer
,
some
wine
,
some
fowl
,
and
such
thing
as
we
think
may
be
acceptable
on
board
.
  
<EOS>
My
governess
be
with
us
all
this
while
,
and
go
with
us
round
into
the
Downs
,
as
do
also
the
captain
's
wife
,
with
whom
she
go
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
so
sorrowful
at
part
with
my
own
mother
as
I
be
at
part
with
her
,
and
I
never
see
her
more
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
fair
easterly
wind
spring
up
the
third
day
after
we
come
to
the
Downs
,
and
we
sail
from
thence
the
10th
of
April
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
we
touch
any
more
at
any
place
,
till
,
be
drive
on
the
coast
of
Ireland
by
a
very
hard
gale
of
wind
<EOS>
,
the
ship
come
to
an
anchor
in
a
little
bay
,
near
the
mouth
of
a
river
,
whose
name
I
remember
not
,
but
they
say
the
river
come
down
from
Limerick
,
and
that
it
be
the
large
river
in
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
be
detain
by
bad
weather
for
some
time
,
the
captain
,
who
continue
the
same
kind
,
good
-
humoured
man
as
at
first
,
take
us
two
on
shore
with
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
it
now
in
kindness
to
my
husband
indeed
,
who
bear
the
sea
very
ill
,
and
be
very
sick
,
especially
when
it
blow
so
hard
.
 
<EOS>
here
we
buy
in
again
a
store
of
fresh
provision
,
especially
beef
,
pork
,
mutton
,
and
fowl
,
and
the
captain
stay
to
pickle
up
five
or
six
barrel
of
beef
to
lengthen
out
the
ship
's
store
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
here
not
above
five
day
,
when
the
weather
turn
mild
,
and
a
fair
wind
,
we
set
sail
again
,
and
in
two
-
and
-
forty
day
come
safe
to
the
coast
of
Virginia
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
draw
near
to
the
shore
,
the
captain
call
me
to
him
,
and
tell
me
that
he
find
by
my
discourse
I
have
some
relation
in
the
place
,
and
that
I
have
be
there
before
,
and
so
he
suppose
I
understand
the
custom
in
their
dispose
the
convict
prisoner
when
they
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
do
not
,
and
that
as
to
what
relation
I
have
in
the
place
,
he
may
be
sure
I
would
make
myself
known
to
none
of
them
while
I
be
in
the
circumstance
of
a
prisoner
,
and
that
as
to
the
rest
,
we
leave
ourselves
entirely
to
him
to
assist
us
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
promise
us
he
would
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
must
get
somebody
in
the
place
to
come
and
buy
us
as
servant
,
and
who
must
answer
for
us
to
the
governor
of
the
country
,
if
he
demand
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
we
should
do
as
he
should
direct
;
so
he
bring
a
planter
to
treat
with
him
,
as
it
be
,
for
the
purchase
of
these
two
servant
,
my
husband
and
me
,
and
there
we
be
formally
sell
to
him
,
and
go
ashore
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
go
with
us
,
and
carry
us
to
a
certain
house
,
whether
it
be
to
be
call
a
tavern
or
not
I
know
not
,
but
we
have
a
bowl
of
punch
there
make
of
rum
,
etc
.
,
and
be
very
merry
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
time
the
planter
give
us
a
certificate
of
discharge
,
and
an
acknowledgment
of
have
serve
him
faithfully
,
and
we
be
free
from
him
the
next
morning
,
to
go
wither
<EOS>
we
would
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
piece
of
service
the
captain
demand
of
us
six
thousand
weight
of
tabacco
,
which
he
say
he
be
accountable
for
to
his
freighter
,
and
which
we
immediately
buy
for
him
,
and
make
him
a
present
of
twenty
guinea
besides
,
with
which
he
be
abundantly
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
proper
to
enter
here
into
the
particular
of
what
part
of
the
colony
of
Virginia
we
settle
in
,
for
diver
reason
;
it
may
suffice
to
mention
that
we
go
into
the
great
river
Potomac
,
the
ship
be
bind
thither
;
and
there
we
intend
to
have
settle
first
,
though
afterwards
we
alter
our
mind
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
I
do
of
moment
after
have
get
all
our
good
on
shore
,
and
place
them
in
a
storehouse
,
or
warehouse
,
which
,
with
a
lodging
,
we
hire
at
the
small
place
or
village
where
we
land
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
the
first
thing
be
to
inquire
after
my
mother
,
and
after
my
brother
(
that
fatal
person
whom
I
marry
as
a
husband
,
as
I
have
relate
at
large
)
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
inquiry
furnish
me
with
information
that
Mrs.
#
#
#
#
,
 
that
is
,
my
mother
,
be
dead
;
that
my
brother
(
or
husband
)
be
alive
,
which
I
confess
I
be
not
very
glad
to
hear
;
but
which
be
bad
<EOS>
,
I
find
he
be
remove
from
the
plantation
where
he
live
formerly
,
and
where
I
live
with
him
,
and
live
with
one
of
his
son
in
a
plantation
just
by
the
place
where
we
land
,
and
where
we
have
hire
a
warehouse
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
surprised
at
first
,
but
as
I
venture
to
satisfy
myself
that
he
could
not
know
me
,
I
be
not
only
perfectly
easy
,
but
have
a
great
mind
to
see
him
,
if
it
be
possible
to
so
do
without
his
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
that
I
find
out
by
inquiry
the
plantation
where
he
live
,
and
with
a
woman
of
that
place
whom
I
get
to
help
me
,
like
what
we
call
a
chairwoman
,
I
ramble
about
towards
the
place
as
if
I
have
only
a
mind
to
see
the
country
and
look
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
come
so
near
that
I
see
the
dwellinghouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
the
woman
whose
plantation
that
be
;
she
say
it
belong
to
such
a
man
,
and
look
out
a
little
to
our
right
hand
,
"
there
,
"
say
she
,
be
the
gentleman
that
own
the
plantation
,
and
his
father
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
their
christian
name
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
say
she
,
"
what
the
old
gentleman
's
name
be
,
but
the
son
's
name
be
Humphrey
;
and
I
believe
,
"
say
she
,
"
the
father
's
be
so
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
guess
,
if
you
can
,
what
a
confused
mixture
of
joy
and
fight
possess
my
thought
upon
this
occasion
,
for
I
immediately
know
that
this
be
nobody
else
but
my
own
son
,
by
that
father
<EOS>
she
show
me
,
who
be
my
own
brother
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
mask
,
but
I
ruffle
my
hood
so
about
my
face
,
that
I
depend
upon
it
that
after
above
twenty
year
"
absence
,
and
withal
not
expect
anything
of
me
in
that
part
of
the
world
,
he
would
not
be
able
to
know
anything
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
need
not
have
use
all
that
caution
,
for
the
old
gentleman
be
grow
dim
-
sight
by
some
distemper
which
have
fall
upon
his
eye
,
and
could
but
just
see
well
enough
to
walk
about
,
and
not
run
against
a
tree
or
into
a
ditch
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
that
be
with
me
have
tell
me
that
by
a
mere
accident
,
know
nothing
of
what
importance
it
be
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
draw
near
to
us
,
I
say
,
"
do
he
know
you
,
Mrs.
Owen
?
"
<EOS>
(
so
they
call
the
woman
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
she
,
"
if
he
hear
me
speak
,
he
will
know
me
;
but
he
can
not
see
well
enough
to
know
me
or
anybody
else
"
;
and
so
she
tell
me
the
story
of
his
sight
,
as
I
have
relate
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
me
secure
,
and
so
I
throw
open
my
hood
again
,
and
let
them
pass
by
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wretched
thing
for
a
mother
thus
to
see
her
own
son
,
a
handsome
,
comely
young
gentleman
in
flourish
circumstance
,
and
durst
not
make
herself
known
to
him
,
and
durst
not
take
any
notice
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
let
any
mother
of
child
that
read
this
consider
it
,
and
but
think
with
what
anguish
of
mind
<EOS>
I
restrain
myself
;
what
yearning
of
soul
I
have
in
me
to
embrace
him
,
and
weep
over
him
;
and
how
I
think
all
my
entrail
turn
within
me
,
that
my
very
bowel
move
,
and
I
know
not
what
to
do
,
as
I
now
know
not
how
to
express
those
agony
!
 
<EOS>
when
he
go
from
me
<EOS>
I
stand
gaze
and
tremble
,
and
look
after
him
as
long
as
I
could
see
him
;
then
sit
down
to
rest
me
,
but
turn
from
her
,
and
lie
on
my
face
,
weep
,
and
kiss
the
ground
that
he
have
set
his
foot
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
conceal
my
disorder
so
much
from
the
woman
but
that
she
perceive
it
,
and
think
I
be
not
well
,
which
I
be
oblige
to
pretend
be
true
;
upon
which
she
press
me
to
rise
,
the
ground
be
damp
and
dangerous
,
which
I
do
accordingly
,
and
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
go
back
again
,
and
still
talk
of
this
gentleman
and
his
son
,
a
new
occasion
of
melancholy
offer
itself
thus
.
<EOS>
the
woman
begin
,
as
if
she
would
tell
me
a
story
to
divert
me
:
"
there
go
,
"
say
she
,
"
a
very
odd
tale
among
the
neighbour
where
this
gentleman
formerly
live
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
old
gentleman
go
to
England
,
when
he
be
a
young
man
,
fall
in
love
with
a
young
lady
there
,
one
of
the
fine
woman
that
ever
be
see
,
and
marry
her
,
and
bring
her
over
hither
to
his
mother
who
be
then
live
.
<EOS>
He
live
here
several
year
with
her
,
"
continue
she
,
"
and
have
several
child
by
her
,
of
which
the
young
gentleman
that
be
with
him
now
be
one
;
but
after
some
time
,
the
old
gentlewoman
,
his
mother
,
talk
to
her
of
something
relate
to
herself
when
she
be
in
England
,
and
of
her
circumstance
in
England
,
which
be
bad
enough
,
the
daughter
-
in
-
law
begin
to
be
very
much
surprised
and
uneasy
;
and
,
in
short
,
examine
further
into
thing
,
it
appear
past
all
contradiction
that
the
old
gentlewoman
be
her
own
mother
,
and
that
consequently
that
son
be
his
wife
's
own
brother
,
which
strike
the
whole
family
with
horror
,
and
put
them
into
such
confusion
that
it
have
almost
ruin
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
woman
would
not
live
with
him
;
the
son
,
her
brother
and
husband
,
for
a
time
go
distract
;
and
at
last
the
young
woman
go
away
for
England
,
and
have
never
be
hear
of
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
believe
that
I
be
strangely
affect
with
this
story
,
but
'
tis
impossible
to
describe
the
nature
of
my
disturbance
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
astonished
at
the
story
,
and
ask
her
a
thousand
question
about
the
particular
,
which
I
find
she
be
thoroughly
acquaint
with
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
begin
to
inquire
into
the
circumstance
of
the
family
,
how
the
old
gentlewoman
,
I
mean
my
mother
,
die
,
and
how
she
leave
what
she
have
;
for
my
mother
have
promise
me
very
solemnly
,
that
when
she
die
she
would
do
something
for
me
,
and
leave
it
so
,
as
that
,
if
I
be
live
,
I
should
one
way
or
other
come
at
it
,
without
its
being
in
the
power
of
her
son
,
my
brother
and
husband
,
to
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
she
do
not
know
exactly
how
it
be
order
,
but
she
have
be
tell
that
my
mother
have
leave
a
sum
of
money
,
and
have
tie
her
plantation
for
the
payment
of
it
,
to
be
make
good
to
the
daughter
,
if
ever
she
could
be
hear
of
,
either
in
England
or
elsewhere
;
and
that
the
trust
be
leave
with
this
son
,
who
be
the
person
that
we
see
with
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
news
too
good
for
me
to
make
light
of
,
and
,
you
may
be
sure
,
fill
my
heart
with
a
thousand
thought
<EOS>
,
what
course
I
should
take
,
<EOS>
how
,
and
when
,
and
in
what
manner
I
should
make
myself
know
,
or
whether
I
should
ever
make
myself
know
<EOS>
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
perplexity
that
I
have
not
indeed
skill
to
manage
myself
in
,
neither
know
I
what
course
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
It
lie
heavy
upon
my
mind
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
neither
sleep
nor
converse
,
so
that
my
husband
perceive
it
,
and
wonder
what
ail
me
,
strove
to
divert
me
,
but
it
be
all
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
press
me
to
tell
him
what
it
be
trouble
me
,
but
I
put
it
off
,
till
at
last
,
importune
me
continually
,
I
be
force
to
form
a
story
,
which
yet
have
a
plain
truth
to
lay
it
upon
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
troubled
because
I
find
we
must
shift
our
quarter
and
alter
our
scheme
of
settle
,
for
that
I
find
I
should
be
know
if
I
stay
in
that
part
of
the
country
;
for
that
my
mother
be
dead
,
several
of
my
relation
be
come
into
that
part
where
we
then
be
,
and
that
I
must
either
discover
myself
to
them
,
which
in
our
present
circumstance
be
not
proper
on
many
account
,
or
remove
;
and
which
to
do
I
know
not
,
and
that
this
it
be
that
make
me
so
melancholy
and
so
thoughtful
.
  
<EOS>
He
join
with
me
in
this
,
that
it
be
by
no
means
proper
for
me
to
make
myself
known
to
anybody
in
the
circumstance
in
which
we
then
be
;
and
therefore
he
tell
me
he
would
be
willing
to
remove
to
any
other
part
of
the
country
,
or
even
to
any
other
country
if
I
think
fit
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
have
another
difficulty
,
which
be
,
that
if
I
remove
to
any
other
colony
,
I
put
myself
out
of
the
way
of
ever
make
a
due
search
after
those
effect
which
my
mother
have
leave
.
 
<EOS>
again
I
could
never
so
much
as
think
of
break
the
secret
of
my
former
marriage
to
my
new
husband
;
it
be
not
a
story
,
as
I
think
,
that
would
bear
tell
,
nor
could
I
tell
what
may
be
the
consequence
of
it
;
and
it
be
impossible
to
search
into
the
bottom
of
the
thing
without
make
it
public
all
over
the
country
,
as
well
who
I
be
,
as
what
I
now
be
also
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
perplexity
I
continue
a
great
while
,
and
this
make
my
spouse
very
uneasy
;
for
he
find
me
perplex
,
and
yet
think
I
be
not
open
with
him
,
and
do
not
let
him
into
every
part
of
my
grievance
;
and
he
would
often
say
,
he
wonder
what
he
have
do
that
I
would
not
trust
him
with
whatever
it
be
,
especially
if
it
be
grievous
and
afflict
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
he
ought
to
have
be
trust
with
everything
,
for
no
man
in
the
world
could
deserve
well
of
a
wife
;
but
this
be
a
thing
I
know
not
how
to
open
to
him
,
and
yet
have
nobody
to
disclose
any
part
of
it
to
,
the
burthen
be
too
heavy
for
my
mind
;
for
let
them
say
what
they
please
of
our
sex
not
be
able
to
keep
a
secret
,
my
life
be
a
plain
conviction
to
me
of
the
contrary
;
but
be
it
our
sex
,
or
the
man
's
sex
,
a
secret
of
moment
should
always
have
a
confidant
,
a
bosom
friend
,
to
whom
we
may
communicate
the
joy
of
it
,
or
the
grief
of
it
,
be
it
which
it
will
,
or
it
will
be
a
double
weight
upon
the
spirit
,
and
perhaps
become
even
insupportable
in
itself
;
and
this
I
appeal
to
all
human
testimony
for
the
truth
of
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
cause
why
many
time
man
as
well
as
woman
,
and
man
of
the
great
and
good
quality
other
way
,
yet
have
find
themselves
weak
in
this
part
,
and
have
not
be
able
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
secret
joy
or
of
a
secret
sorrow
,
but
have
be
oblige
to
disclose
it
,
even
for
the
mere
give
vent
to
themselves
,
and
to
unbend
the
mind
oppress
with
the
load
and
weight
which
attend
it
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
any
token
of
folly
or
thoughtlessness
at
all
,
but
a
natural
consequence
of
the
thing
;
and
<EOS>
such
people
,
have
they
struggle
longer
with
the
oppression
,
would
certainly
have
tell
it
in
their
sleep
,
and
disclose
the
secret
,
let
it
have
be
of
what
fatal
nature
soever
,
without
regard
to
the
person
to
whom
it
may
be
expose
.
 
<EOS>
this
necessity
of
nature
be
a
thing
which
work
sometimes
with
such
vehemence
in
the
mind
of
those
who
be
guilty
of
any
atrocious
villainy
,
such
as
secret
murder
in
particular
,
that
they
have
be
oblige
to
discover
it
,
though
the
consequence
would
necessarily
be
their
own
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
though
it
may
be
true
that
the
divine
justice
ought
to
have
the
glory
of
all
those
discovery
and
confession
,
yet
'
tis
as
certain
that
Providence
,
which
ordinarily
work
by
the
hand
of
nature
,
make
use
here
of
the
same
natural
cause
to
produce
those
extraordinary
effect
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
give
several
remarkable
instance
of
this
in
my
long
conversation
with
crime
and
with
criminal
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
one
fellow
that
,
while
I
be
in
prison
in
Newgate
,
be
one
of
those
they
call
then
night
-
flier
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
other
word
they
may
have
understand
it
by
since
,
but
he
be
one
who
by
connivance
be
admit
to
go
abroad
every
evening
,
when
he
play
his
prank
,
and
furnish
those
honest
people
they
call
thief
-
catcher
with
business
to
find
out
the
next
day
,
and
restore
for
a
reward
what
they
have
steal
the
evening
before
.
 
<EOS>
this
fellow
be
as
sure
to
tell
in
his
sleep
all
that
he
have
do
,
and
every
step
he
have
take
,
what
he
have
steal
,
and
where
,
as
sure
as
if
he
have
engage
to
tell
it
wake
,
and
that
there
be
no
harm
or
danger
in
it
,
and
therefore
he
be
oblige
,
after
he
have
be
out
,
to
lock
himself
up
,
or
be
lock
up
by
some
of
the
keeper
that
have
him
in
fee
,
that
nobody
should
hear
him
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
he
have
tell
all
the
particular
,
and
give
a
full
account
of
his
ramble
and
success
,
to
any
comrade
,
any
brother
thief
,
or
to
his
employer
,
as
I
may
justly
call
them
,
then
all
be
well
with
him
,
and
he
sleep
as
quietly
as
other
people
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
publishing
this
account
of
my
life
be
for
the
sake
of
the
just
moral
of
very
part
of
it
,
and
for
instruction
,
caution
,
warning
,
and
improvement
to
every
reader
,
so
this
will
not
pass
,
I
hope
,
for
an
unnecessary
digression
concern
some
people
be
oblige
to
disclose
the
great
secret
either
of
their
own
or
other
people
's
affair
.
  
<EOS>
under
the
certain
oppression
of
this
weight
upon
my
mind
,
I
labour
in
the
case
I
have
be
name
;
and
the
only
relief
I
find
for
it
be
to
let
my
husband
into
so
much
of
it
as
I
think
would
convince
him
of
the
necessity
there
be
for
us
to
think
of
settle
in
some
other
part
of
the
world
;
and
the
next
consideration
before
us
be
,
which
part
of
the
english
settlement
we
should
go
to
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
be
a
perfect
stranger
to
the
country
,
and
have
not
yet
so
much
as
a
geographical
knowledge
of
the
situation
of
the
several
place
;
and
I
,
that
,
till
I
write
this
,
do
not
know
what
the
word
geographical
signify
,
have
only
a
general
knowledge
from
long
conversation
with
people
that
come
from
or
go
to
several
place
;
but
this
I
know
,
that
Maryland
,
Pennsylvania
,
East
and
West
Jersey
,
New
York
,
and
New
England
lie
all
north
of
Virginia
,
and
that
they
be
consequently
all
cold
climate
,
to
which
for
that
very
reason
,
I
have
an
aversion
.
 
<EOS>
for
that
as
I
naturally
love
warm
weather
,
so
now
I
grow
into
year
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
inclination
to
shun
a
cold
climate
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
consider
of
go
to
Caroline
,
which
be
the
only
southern
colony
of
the
English
on
the
continent
of
America
,
and
hither
I
propose
to
go
;
and
the
rather
because
I
may
with
great
ease
come
from
thence
at
any
time
,
when
it
may
be
proper
to
inquire
after
my
mother
's
effect
,
and
to
make
myself
know
enough
to
demand
them
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
resolution
I
propose
to
my
husband
our
go
away
from
where
we
be
,
and
carry
all
our
effect
with
us
to
Caroline
,
where
we
resolve
to
settle
;
for
my
husband
readily
agree
to
the
first
part
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
be
not
at
all
proper
to
stay
where
we
be
,
since
I
have
assure
him
we
should
be
know
there
,
and
the
rest
I
effectually
conceal
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
I
find
a
new
difficulty
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
main
affair
grow
heavy
upon
my
mind
still
,
and
I
could
not
think
of
go
out
of
the
country
without
somehow
or
other
make
inquiry
into
the
grand
affair
of
what
my
mother
have
do
for
me
;
nor
could
I
with
any
patience
bear
the
thought
of
go
away
,
and
not
make
myself
known
to
my
old
husband
(
brother
)
,
or
to
my
child
,
his
son
;
only
I
would
fain
have
have
this
do
without
my
new
husband
have
any
knowledge
of
it
,
or
they
have
any
knowledge
of
him
,
or
that
I
have
such
a
thing
as
a
husband
.
  
<EOS>
I
cast
about
innumerable
way
in
my
thought
how
this
may
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
gladly
have
send
my
husband
away
to
Caroline
with
all
our
good
,
and
have
come
after
myself
,
but
this
be
impracticable
;
he
would
never
stir
without
me
,
be
himself
perfectly
unacquainted
with
the
country
,
and
with
the
method
of
settle
there
or
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
think
we
would
both
go
first
with
part
of
our
good
,
and
that
when
we
be
settle
I
should
come
back
to
Virginia
and
fetch
the
remainder
;
but
even
then
I
know
he
would
never
part
with
me
,
and
be
leave
there
to
go
on
alone
.
 
<EOS>
the
case
be
plain
;
he
be
breed
a
gentleman
,
and
by
consequence
be
not
only
unacquainted
,
but
indolent
,
and
when
we
do
settle
,
would
much
rather
go
out
into
the
wood
with
his
gun
,
which
they
call
there
hunting
,
and
which
be
the
ordinary
work
of
the
Indians
,
and
which
they
do
as
servant
;
I
say
,
he
would
rather
do
that
than
attend
the
natural
business
of
his
plantation
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
therefore
difficulty
insurmountable
,
and
such
as
I
know
not
what
to
do
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
such
strong
impression
on
my
mind
about
discover
myself
to
my
brother
,
formerly
my
husband
,
that
I
could
not
withstand
them
;
and
the
rather
,
because
it
run
constantly
in
my
thought
,
that
if
I
do
not
do
it
while
he
live
,
I
may
in
vain
endeavour
to
convince
my
son
afterward
that
I
be
really
the
same
person
,
and
that
I
be
his
mother
,
and
so
may
both
lose
the
assistance
and
comfort
of
the
relation
,
and
the
benefit
of
whatever
it
be
my
mother
have
leave
me
;
and
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
I
could
never
think
it
proper
to
discover
myself
to
them
in
the
circumstance
I
be
in
,
<EOS>
as
well
relate
to
the
have
a
husband
with
me
as
to
my
being
bring
over
by
a
legal
transportation
as
a
criminal
;
on
both
which
account
it
be
absolutely
necessary
to
me
to
remove
from
the
place
where
I
be
,
and
come
again
to
him
,
as
from
another
place
and
in
another
figure
.
  
<EOS>
upon
those
consideration
,
 
I
go
on
with
tell
my
husband
<EOS>
the
absolute
necessity
there
be
of
our
not
settle
in
Potomac
River
,
at
least
that
we
should
be
presently
make
public
there
;
whereas
if
we
go
to
any
other
place
in
the
world
,
we
should
come
in
with
as
much
reputation
as
any
family
that
come
to
plant
;
that
,
as
it
be
always
agreeable
to
the
inhabitant
to
have
family
come
among
them
to
plant
,
who
bring
substance
with
them
,
either
to
purchase
plantation
or
begin
new
one
,
so
we
should
be
sure
of
a
kind
,
agreeable
reception
,
and
that
without
any
possibility
of
a
discovery
of
our
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
in
general
,
too
,
that
as
I
have
several
relation
in
the
place
where
we
be
,
and
that
I
durst
not
now
let
myself
be
know
to
them
,
because
they
would
soon
come
into
a
knowledge
of
the
occasion
and
reason
of
my
come
over
,
which
would
be
to
expose
myself
to
the
last
degree
,
so
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
my
mother
,
who
die
here
,
have
leave
me
something
,
and
perhaps
considerable
,
which
it
may
be
very
well
worth
my
while
to
inquire
after
;
but
that
this
too
could
not
be
do
without
expose
us
publicly
,
unless
we
go
from
hence
;
and
then
,
wherever
we
settle
,
I
may
come
,
as
it
be
,
to
visit
and
to
see
my
brother
and
nephews
,
make
myself
known
to
them
,
claim
and
inquire
<EOS>
after
what
be
my
due
,
be
receive
with
respect
,
and
at
the
same
time
have
justice
do
me
with
cheerfulness
and
good
will
;
whereas
,
if
I
do
it
now
,
I
could
expect
nothing
but
with
trouble
,
such
as
exact
it
by
force
,
receive
it
with
curse
and
reluctance
,
and
with
all
kind
of
affront
,
which
he
would
not
perhaps
bear
to
see
;
that
in
case
of
be
oblige
to
legal
proof
of
be
really
her
daughter
,
I
may
be
at
loss
,
be
oblige
to
have
recourse
to
England
,
and
it
may
be
to
fail
at
last
,
and
so
lose
it
,
whatever
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
with
these
argument
,
and
have
thus
acquaint
my
husband
with
the
whole
secret
so
far
as
be
needful
of
him
,
we
resolve
to
go
and
seek
a
settlement
in
some
other
colony
,
and
at
first
thought
,
Caroline
be
the
place
we
pitch
upon
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
this
we
begin
to
make
inquiry
for
vessel
go
to
Carolina
,
and
in
a
very
little
while
get
information
,
that
on
the
other
side
the
bay
,
as
they
call
it
,
namely
,
in
Maryland
,
there
be
a
ship
which
come
from
Carolina
,
laden
with
rice
and
other
good
,
and
be
go
back
again
thither
,
and
from
thence
to
Jamaica
,
with
provision
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
news
we
hire
a
sloop
to
take
in
our
good
,
and
take
,
as
it
be
,
a
final
farewell
of
Potomac
River
<EOS>
,
we
go
with
all
our
cargo
over
to
Maryland
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
long
and
unpleasant
voyage
,
and
my
spouse
say
it
be
bad
to
him
than
all
the
voyage
from
England
,
because
the
weather
be
but
indifferent
,
the
water
rough
,
and
the
vessel
small
and
inconvenient
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
we
be
full
a
hundred
mile
up
Potomac
River
,
in
a
part
which
they
call
Westmoreland
County
,
and
as
that
river
be
by
far
the
great
in
Virginia
,
and
I
have
hear
say
it
be
the
great
river
in
the
world
that
fall
into
another
river
,
and
not
directly
into
the
sea
,
so
we
have
base
weather
in
it
,
and
be
frequently
in
great
danger
;
for
though
we
be
in
the
middle
,
we
could
not
see
land
on
either
side
for
many
league
together
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
have
the
great
river
or
bay
of
Chesapeake
to
cross
,
which
be
where
the
river
Potomac
fall
into
it
,
near
thirty
mile
broad
,
and
we
enter
more
great
vast
water
whose
name
I
know
not
,
so
that
our
voyage
be
full
two
hundred
mile
,
in
a
poor
,
sorry
sloop
,
with
all
our
treasure
,
and
if
any
accident
have
happen
to
us
,
we
may
at
last
have
be
very
miserable
;
supposing
we
have
lose
our
good
and
save
our
life
only
,
and
have
then
be
leave
naked
and
destitute
,
and
in
a
wild
,
strange
place
not
have
one
friend
or
acquaintance
in
all
that
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
very
thought
of
it
give
me
some
horror
,
even
since
the
danger
be
past
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
we
come
to
the
place
in
five
day
'
sailing
;
I
think
they
call
it
Philip
's
Point
;
and
behold
,
when
we
come
thither
,
the
ship
bind
to
Carolina
be
load
and
go
away
but
three
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
disappointment
;
but
,
however
,
I
,
that
be
to
be
discourage
with
nothing
,
tell
my
husband
that
since
we
could
not
get
passage
to
Caroline
,
and
that
the
country
we
be
in
be
very
fertile
and
good
,
we
would
,
if
he
like
of
it
,
see
if
we
could
find
out
anything
for
our
tune
where
we
be
,
and
that
if
he
like
thing
we
would
settle
here
.
  
<EOS>
We
immediately
go
on
shore
,
but
find
no
convenience
just
at
that
place
,
either
for
our
be
on
shore
or
preserve
our
good
on
shore
,
but
be
direct
by
a
very
honest
Quaker
,
whom
we
find
there
,
to
go
to
a
place
about
sixty
mile
east
;
that
be
to
say
,
nearer
the
mouth
of
the
bay
,
where
he
say
he
live
,
and
where
we
should
be
accommodate
,
either
to
plant
,
or
to
wait
for
any
other
place
to
plant
in
that
may
be
more
convenient
;
and
he
invite
us
with
so
much
kindness
and
simple
honesty
,
that
we
agree
to
go
,
and
the
Quaker
himself
go
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
buy
us
two
servant
,
viz
.
<EOS>
an
english
woman
-
servant
just
come
on
shore
from
a
ship
of
Liverpool
,
and
a
Negro
man
-
servant
,
thing
absolutely
necessary
for
all
people
that
pretend
to
settle
in
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
this
honest
Quaker
be
very
helpful
to
us
,
and
when
we
come
to
the
place
that
he
propose
to
us
,
find
us
out
a
convenient
storehouse
for
our
good
,
and
lodge
for
ourselves
and
our
servant
;
and
about
two
month
or
thereabout
afterwards
,
by
his
direction
,
we
take
up
a
large
piece
of
land
from
the
governor
of
that
country
,
in
order
to
form
our
plantation
,
and
so
we
lay
the
thought
of
go
to
Caroline
wholly
aside
,
have
be
very
well
receive
here
,
and
accommodate
with
a
convenient
lodging
till
we
could
prepare
thing
,
and
have
land
enough
clear
,
and
timber
and
material
provide
for
build
us
a
house
,
all
which
we
manage
by
the
direction
of
the
Quaker
;
so
that
in
one
year
's
time
we
have
nearly
fifty
acre
of
land
clear
,
part
of
it
enclose
,
and
some
of
it
plant
with
tabacco
,
though
not
much
;
besides
,
we
have
garden
ground
and
corn
sufficient
to
help
supply
our
servant
with
root
and
herb
and
bread
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
persuade
my
husband
to
let
me
go
over
the
bay
again
,
and
inquire
after
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
willinger
to
consent
to
it
now
,
because
he
have
business
upon
his
hand
sufficient
to
employ
him
,
besides
his
gun
to
divert
him
,
which
they
call
hunt
there
,
and
which
he
greatly
delight
in
;
and
indeed
we
use
to
look
at
one
another
,
sometimes
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
,
reflect
how
much
better
that
be
,
not
than
Newgate
only
,
but
than
the
most
prosperous
of
our
circumstance
in
the
wicked
trade
that
we
have
be
both
carry
on
.
  
<EOS>
Our
affair
be
in
a
very
good
posture
;
we
purchase
of
the
proprietor
of
the
colony
as
much
land
for
#
#
#
#
35
,
pay
in
ready
money
,
as
would
make
a
sufficient
plantation
to
employ
between
fifty
and
sixty
servant
,
and
which
,
be
well
improved
,
would
be
sufficient
to
us
as
long
as
we
could
either
of
us
live
;
and
as
for
child
,
I
be
past
the
prospect
of
anything
of
that
kind
.
  
<EOS>
but
out
good
fortune
do
not
end
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
,
as
I
have
say
,
over
the
bay
,
to
the
place
where
my
brother
,
once
a
husband
,
live
;
but
I
do
not
go
to
the
same
village
where
I
be
before
,
but
go
up
another
great
river
,
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
Potomac
,
call
Rappahannock
River
,
and
by
this
mean
come
on
the
back
of
his
plantation
,
which
be
large
,
and
by
the
help
of
a
navigable
creek
,
or
little
river
,
that
run
into
the
Rappahannock
<EOS>
,
I
come
very
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
fully
resolve
to
go
up
point
-
blank
to
my
brother
(
husband
)
,
and
to
tell
him
who
I
be
;
but
not
know
what
temper
I
may
find
him
in
,
or
how
much
out
of
temper
<EOS>
rather
,
I
may
make
him
by
such
a
rash
visit
<EOS>
,
I
resolve
to
write
a
letter
to
him
first
,
to
let
him
know
who
I
be
,
and
that
I
be
come
not
to
give
him
any
trouble
upon
the
old
relation
,
which
I
hope
be
entirely
forget
,
but
that
I
apply
to
him
as
a
sister
to
a
brother
,
desire
his
assistance
in
the
case
of
that
provision
which
our
mother
,
at
her
decease
,
have
leave
for
my
support
,
and
which
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
would
do
me
justice
in
,
especially
consider
that
I
be
come
thus
far
to
look
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
some
very
tender
,
kind
thing
in
the
letter
about
his
son
,
which
I
tell
him
he
know
to
be
my
own
child
,
and
that
as
I
be
guilty
of
nothing
in
marry
him
,
any
more
than
he
be
in
marry
me
,
neither
of
us
have
then
know
our
being
at
all
relate
to
one
another
,
so
I
hope
he
would
allow
me
the
most
passionate
desire
of
once
see
my
one
and
only
child
,
and
of
show
something
of
the
infirmity
of
a
mother
in
preserve
a
violent
affect
for
him
,
who
have
never
be
able
to
retain
any
thought
of
me
one
way
or
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
believe
that
,
have
receive
this
letter
,
he
would
immediately
give
it
to
his
son
to
read
<EOS>
,
I
have
understand
his
eye
be
so
dim
,
that
he
could
not
see
to
read
it
;
but
it
fall
out
better
than
so
,
for
as
his
sight
be
dim
,
so
he
have
allow
his
son
to
open
all
letter
that
come
to
his
hand
for
him
,
and
the
old
gentleman
be
from
home
,
or
out
of
the
way
when
my
messenger
come
,
my
letter
come
directly
to
my
son
's
hand
,
and
he
open
and
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
call
the
messenger
in
,
after
some
little
stay
,
and
ask
him
where
the
person
be
who
give
him
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
the
messenger
tell
him
the
place
,
which
be
about
seven
mile
off
,
so
he
bid
him
stay
,
and
order
a
horse
to
be
get
ready
,
and
two
servant
,
away
he
come
to
me
with
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
let
any
one
judge
the
consternation
I
be
in
when
my
messenger
come
back
,
and
tell
me
the
old
gentleman
be
not
at
home
,
but
his
son
be
come
along
with
him
,
and
be
just
come
up
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
confound
,
for
I
know
not
whether
it
be
peace
or
war
,
nor
could
I
tell
how
to
behave
;
however
,
I
have
but
a
very
few
moment
to
think
,
for
my
son
be
at
the
heel
of
the
messenger
,
and
come
up
into
my
lodging
,
ask
the
fellow
at
the
door
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
,
for
I
do
not
hear
it
so
as
to
understand
it
,
which
be
the
gentlewoman
that
send
him
;
for
the
messenger
say
,
"
there
she
be
,
sir
"
;
at
which
he
come
directly
up
to
me
,
kiss
me
,
take
me
in
his
arm
,
and
embrace
me
with
so
much
passion
that
he
could
not
speak
,
but
I
could
feel
his
breast
heave
and
throb
like
a
child
,
that
cry
,
but
sobs
,
and
can
not
cry
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
neither
express
nor
describe
the
joy
that
touch
my
very
soul
when
I
find
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
easy
to
discover
that
part
,
that
he
come
not
as
a
stranger
,
but
as
a
son
to
a
mother
,
and
indeed
as
a
son
who
have
never
before
know
what
a
mother
of
his
own
be
;
in
short
,
we
cry
over
one
another
a
considerable
while
,
when
at
last
he
break
out
first
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
mother
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
you
still
alive
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
expect
to
have
see
your
face
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
could
say
nothing
a
great
while
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
both
recover
ourselves
a
little
,
and
be
able
to
talk
,
he
tell
me
how
thing
stand
.
<EOS>
as
to
what
I
have
write
to
his
father
,
he
tell
me
he
have
not
show
my
letter
to
his
father
,
or
tell
him
anything
about
it
;
that
what
his
grandmother
leave
me
be
in
his
hand
,
and
that
he
would
do
me
justice
to
my
full
satisfaction
;
that
as
to
his
father
,
he
be
old
and
infirm
both
in
body
and
mind
;
that
he
be
very
fretful
and
passionate
,
almost
blind
,
and
capable
of
nothing
;
and
he
question
whether
he
would
know
how
to
act
in
an
affair
which
be
of
so
nice
a
nature
as
this
;
and
that
therefore
he
have
come
himself
,
as
well
to
satisfy
himself
in
see
me
,
which
he
could
not
restrain
himself
from
,
as
also
to
put
it
into
my
power
to
make
a
judgment
,
after
I
have
see
how
thing
be
,
whether
I
would
discover
myself
to
his
father
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
really
so
prudently
and
wisely
manage
,
that
I
find
my
son
be
a
man
of
sense
,
and
need
no
direction
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
do
not
wonder
that
his
father
be
as
he
have
describe
him
,
for
that
his
head
be
a
little
touch
before
I
go
away
;
and
principally
his
disturbance
be
because
I
could
not
be
persuade
to
conceal
our
relation
and
to
live
with
him
as
my
husband
,
after
I
know
that
he
be
my
brother
;
that
as
he
know
better
than
I
what
his
father
's
present
condition
be
,
I
should
readily
join
with
him
in
such
measure
as
he
would
direct
;
that
I
be
indifferent
as
to
see
his
father
,
since
I
have
see
him
first
,
and
he
could
not
have
tell
me
well
news
than
to
tell
me
that
what
his
grandmother
have
leave
me
be
entrust
in
his
hand
,
who
,
I
doubt
not
,
<EOS>
now
he
know
who
I
be
,
would
,
as
he
say
,
do
me
justice
.
 
<EOS>
I
inquire
then
how
long
my
mother
have
be
dead
,
and
where
she
die
,
and
tell
so
many
particular
of
the
family
,
that
I
leave
him
no
room
to
doubt
the
truth
of
my
be
really
and
truly
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
My
son
then
inquire
where
I
be
,
and
how
I
have
dispose
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
on
the
Maryland
side
of
the
bay
,
at
the
plantation
of
a
particular
friend
who
come
from
England
in
the
same
ship
with
me
;
that
as
for
that
side
of
the
bay
where
he
be
,
I
have
no
habitation
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
should
go
home
with
him
,
and
live
with
him
,
if
I
please
,
as
long
as
I
live
;
that
as
to
his
father
,
he
know
nobody
,
and
would
never
so
much
as
guess
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
consider
of
that
a
little
,
and
tell
him
,
that
though
it
be
really
no
concern
to
me
to
live
at
a
distance
from
him
,
yet
I
could
not
say
it
would
be
the
most
comfortable
thing
in
the
world
to
me
to
live
in
the
house
with
him
,
and
to
have
that
unhappy
object
always
before
me
,
which
have
be
such
a
blow
to
my
peace
before
;
that
though
I
should
be
glad
to
have
his
company
(
my
son
)
,
or
to
be
as
near
him
as
possible
while
I
stay
,
yet
I
could
not
think
of
be
in
the
house
where
I
should
be
also
under
constant
restraint
for
fear
of
betray
myself
in
my
discourse
,
nor
should
I
be
able
to
refrain
some
expression
in
my
conversing
with
him
as
my
son
,
that
may
discover
the
whole
affair
,
which
would
by
no
means
be
convenient
.
  
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
that
I
be
right
in
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
then
,
dear
mother
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
shall
be
as
near
me
as
you
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
he
take
me
with
him
on
horseback
to
a
plantation
next
to
his
own
,
and
where
I
be
as
well
entertain
as
I
could
have
be
in
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
have
leave
me
there
he
go
away
home
,
tell
me
we
would
talk
of
the
main
business
the
next
day
;
and
have
first
call
me
his
aunt
,
and
give
a
charge
to
the
people
,
who
it
seem
be
his
tenant
,
to
treat
me
with
all
possible
respect
.
<EOS>
about
two
hour
after
he
be
go
,
he
send
me
a
maid
-
servant
and
a
Negro
boy
to
wait
on
me
,
and
provision
ready
dress
for
my
supper
;
and
thus
I
be
as
if
I
have
be
in
a
new
world
,
and
begin
secretly
now
to
wish
that
I
have
not
bring
my
Lancashire
husband
from
England
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
that
wish
be
not
hearty
neither
,
for
I
love
my
Lancashire
husband
entirely
,
as
indeed
I
have
ever
do
from
the
beginning
;
and
he
merit
from
me
as
much
as
it
be
possible
for
a
man
to
do
;
but
that
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
my
son
come
to
visit
me
again
almost
as
soon
as
I
be
up
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
discourse
,
he
first
of
all
pull
out
a
deerskin
bag
,
and
give
it
me
,
with
five
-
and
-
fifty
spanish
pistole
in
it
,
and
tell
me
that
be
to
supply
my
expense
from
England
,
for
though
it
be
not
his
business
to
inquire
,
yet
he
ought
to
think
I
do
not
bring
a
great
deal
of
money
out
with
me
,
it
not
be
usual
to
bring
much
money
into
that
country
.
<EOS>
then
he
pull
out
his
grandmother
's
will
,
and
read
it
over
to
me
,
whereby
it
appear
that
she
have
leave
a
small
plantation
,
as
he
call
it
,
on
York
River
,
that
is
,
where
my
mother
live
,
to
me
,
with
the
stock
of
servant
and
cattle
upon
it
,
and
give
it
in
trust
to
this
son
of
mine
for
my
use
,
whenever
he
should
hear
of
my
be
alive
,
and
to
my
heir
,
if
I
have
any
child
,
and
in
default
of
heir
,
to
whomsoever
I
should
by
will
dispose
of
it
;
but
give
the
income
of
it
,
till
I
should
be
hear
of
,
or
find
,
to
my
say
son
;
and
if
I
should
not
be
live
,
then
it
be
to
him
,
and
his
heir
.
  
<EOS>
this
plantation
,
though
remote
from
him
,
he
say
he
do
not
let
out
,
but
manage
it
by
a
head
-
clerk
(
steward
)
,
as
he
do
another
that
be
his
father
's
,
that
lie
hard
by
it
,
and
go
over
himself
three
or
four
time
a
year
to
look
after
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
what
he
think
the
plantation
may
be
worth
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
if
I
would
let
it
out
,
he
would
give
me
about
#
#
#
#
60
a
year
for
it
;
<EOS>
but
if
I
would
live
on
it
,
then
it
would
be
worth
much
more
,
and
,
he
believe
,
would
bring
me
in
about
#
#
#
#
150
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
but
see
I
be
likely
either
to
settle
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
,
or
may
perhaps
have
a
mind
to
go
back
to
England
again
,
if
I
would
let
him
be
my
steward
he
would
manage
it
for
me
,
as
he
have
do
for
himself
,
and
that
he
believe
he
should
be
able
to
send
me
as
much
tobacco
to
England
from
it
as
would
yield
me
about
#
#
#
#
100
a
year
,
sometimes
more
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
strange
news
to
me
,
and
thing
I
have
not
be
use
to
;
and
really
my
heart
begin
to
look
up
more
seriously
than
I
think
it
ever
do
before
,
and
to
look
with
great
thankfulness
to
the
hand
of
Providence
,
which
have
do
such
wonder
for
me
,
who
have
be
myself
the
great
wonder
of
wickedness
perhaps
that
have
be
suffer
to
live
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
again
observe
,
that
not
on
this
occasion
only
,
but
even
on
all
other
occasion
of
thankfulness
,
my
past
wicked
and
abominable
life
never
look
so
monstrous
to
me
,
and
I
never
so
completely
abhor
it
,
and
reproach
myself
with
it
,
as
when
I
have
a
sense
upon
me
of
Providence
do
good
to
me
,
while
I
have
be
make
those
vile
return
on
my
part
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
leave
the
reader
to
improve
these
thought
,
as
no
doubt
they
will
see
cause
,
and
I
go
on
to
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
My
son
's
tender
carriage
and
kind
offer
fetched
tear
from
me
,
almost
all
the
while
he
talk
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
could
scarce
discourse
with
him
but
in
the
interval
of
my
passion
;
however
,
at
length
I
begin
,
and
express
myself
with
wonder
at
my
being
so
happy
to
have
the
trust
of
what
I
have
leave
,
put
into
the
hand
of
my
own
child
,
I
tell
him
,
that
as
to
the
inheritance
of
it
,
I
have
no
child
but
him
in
the
world
,
and
be
now
past
have
any
if
I
should
marry
,
and
therefore
would
desire
him
to
get
a
writing
draw
,
which
I
be
ready
to
execute
,
by
which
I
would
,
after
me
,
give
it
wholly
to
him
and
to
his
heir
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
meantime
,
smile
,
I
ask
him
what
make
him
continue
a
bachelor
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
His
answer
be
kind
and
ready
,
that
Virginia
do
not
yield
any
great
plenty
of
wife
,
and
that
since
I
talk
of
go
back
to
England
,
I
should
send
him
a
wife
from
London
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
substance
of
our
first
day
's
conversation
,
the
pleasantest
day
that
ever
pass
over
my
head
in
my
life
,
and
which
give
me
the
true
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
every
day
after
this
,
and
spend
a
great
part
of
his
time
with
me
,
and
carry
me
about
to
several
of
his
friend
'
house
,
where
I
be
entertain
with
great
respect
.
 
<EOS>
also
I
dine
several
time
at
his
own
house
,
when
he
take
care
always
to
see
his
half
-
dead
father
so
out
of
the
way
that
I
never
see
him
,
or
he
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
him
one
present
,
and
it
be
all
I
have
of
value
,
and
that
be
one
of
the
gold
watch
,
of
which
I
mention
above
,
that
I
have
two
in
my
chest
,
and
this
I
happen
to
have
with
me
,
and
I
give
it
him
at
his
third
visit
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
have
nothing
of
any
value
to
bestow
but
<EOS>
that
,
and
I
desire
he
would
now
and
then
kiss
it
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
indeed
tell
him
that
I
have
steal
it
from
a
gentlewoman
's
side
,
at
a
meeting
-
house
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
stand
a
little
while
hesitate
,
as
if
doubtful
whether
to
take
it
or
no
;
but
I
press
it
on
him
,
and
make
him
accept
it
,
and
it
be
not
much
less
worth
than
his
leather
pouch
full
of
spanish
gold
;
<EOS>
no
,
though
it
be
to
be
reckon
as
if
at
London
,
whereas
it
be
worth
twice
as
much
there
,
where
I
give
it
him
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
take
it
,
kiss
it
,
tell
me
the
watch
should
be
a
debt
upon
him
that
he
would
be
pay
as
long
as
I
live
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
he
bring
the
writing
of
gift
,
and
the
scrivener
with
them
,
and
I
sign
them
very
freely
,
and
deliver
them
to
him
with
a
hundred
kiss
;
for
sure
nothing
ever
pass
between
a
mother
and
a
tender
,
dutiful
child
with
more
affection
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
he
bring
me
an
obligation
under
his
hand
and
seal
,
whereby
he
engage
himself
to
manage
and
improve
the
plantation
for
my
account
,
and
with
his
utmost
skill
,
and
to
remit
the
produce
to
my
order
wherever
I
should
be
;
and
withal
,
to
be
oblige
himself
to
make
up
the
produce
#
#
#
#
100
a
year
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
so
,
he
tell
me
that
as
I
come
to
demand
it
before
the
crop
be
off
,
I
have
a
right
to
produce
of
the
current
year
,
and
so
he
pay
me
#
#
#
#
100
in
spanish
piece
of
eight
,
and
desire
me
to
give
him
a
receipt
for
it
as
in
full
for
that
year
,
end
at
Christmas
follow
;
<EOS>
this
be
about
the
latter
end
of
August
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay
here
about
five
week
,
and
indeed
have
much
ado
to
get
away
then
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
would
have
come
over
the
bay
with
me
,
but
I
would
by
no
mean
allow
him
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
would
send
me
over
in
a
sloop
of
his
own
,
which
be
build
like
a
yacht
,
and
serve
him
as
well
for
pleasure
as
business
.
<EOS>
this
I
accept
of
,
and
so
,
after
the
utmost
expression
both
of
duty
and
affection
,
he
let
me
come
away
,
and
I
arrive
safe
in
two
day
at
my
friend
be
the
Quaker
's
.
  
<EOS>
I
bring
over
with
me
for
the
use
of
our
plantation
,
three
horse
,
with
harness
and
saddle
,
some
hog
,
two
cow
,
and
a
thousand
other
thing
,
the
gift
of
the
kind
and
tender
child
that
ever
woman
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
relate
to
my
husband
all
the
particular
of
this
voyage
,
except
that
I
call
my
son
my
cousin
;
and
first
I
tell
him
that
I
have
lose
my
watch
,
which
he
seem
to
take
as
a
misfortune
;
but
then
I
tell
him
how
kind
my
cousin
have
be
,
that
my
mother
have
leave
me
such
a
plantation
,
and
that
he
have
preserve
it
for
me
,
in
hope
some
time
or
other
he
should
hear
from
me
;
then
I
tell
him
that
I
have
leave
it
to
his
management
,
that
he
would
render
me
a
faithful
account
of
its
produce
;
and
then
I
pull
him
out
the
#
#
#
#
100
in
silver
,
as
the
first
year
's
produce
;
and
then
pull
out
the
deerskin
purse
with
the
pistole
,
"
and
here
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
the
gold
watch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
husband
 
<EOS>
so
be
Heaven
's
goodness
sure
to
work
the
same
effect
in
all
sensible
mind
where
mercy
touch
the
heart
 
<EOS>
lift
up
both
hand
,
and
with
an
ecstacy
of
joy
,
"
what
be
God
a
-
do
,
"
say
he
,
"
for
such
an
ungrateful
dog
as
I
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
I
let
him
know
what
I
have
bring
over
in
the
sloop
,
besides
all
this
;
I
mean
the
horse
,
hog
,
and
cow
,
and
other
store
for
our
plantation
;
all
which
add
to
his
surprise
,
and
fill
his
heart
with
thankfulness
;
and
from
this
time
forward
I
believe
he
be
as
sincere
a
penitent
,
and
as
thoroughly
a
reformed
man
,
as
ever
God
's
goodness
bring
back
from
a
profligate
,
a
highwayman
,
and
a
robber
.
<EOS>
I
could
fill
a
large
history
than
this
with
the
evidence
of
this
truth
,
and
but
that
I
doubt
that
part
of
the
story
will
not
be
equally
divert
as
the
wicked
part
,
I
have
have
thought
of
make
a
volume
of
it
by
itself
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
as
this
be
to
be
my
own
story
,
not
my
husband
's
,
I
return
to
that
part
which
relate
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
on
with
our
plantation
,
and
manage
it
with
the
help
and
diversion
of
such
friend
as
we
get
there
by
our
oblige
behaviour
,
and
especially
the
honest
Quaker
,
who
prove
a
faithful
,
generous
,
and
steady
friend
to
us
;
and
we
have
very
good
success
,
for
have
a
flourish
stock
to
begin
with
,
as
I
have
say
,
and
this
be
now
increase
by
the
addition
of
#
#
#
#
150
sterling
in
money
,
we
enlarge
our
number
of
servant
,
build
us
a
very
good
house
,
and
cure
every
year
a
great
deal
of
land
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
year
I
write
to
my
old
governess
,
give
her
part
with
us
of
the
joy
of
our
success
,
and
order
her
how
to
lay
out
the
money
I
have
leave
with
her
,
which
be
#
#
#
#
250
as
above
,
and
to
send
it
to
us
in
good
,
which
she
perform
with
her
usual
kindness
and
fidelity
,
and
this
arrive
safe
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
have
a
supply
of
all
sort
of
clothe
,
as
well
for
my
husband
as
for
myself
;
and
I
take
especial
care
to
buy
for
him
all
those
thing
that
I
know
he
delight
to
have
;
as

,
three
or
four
fine
fowling

piece
,
a
find
saddle
with
holster
and
pistol
very
handsome
,
with
a
scarlet
cloak
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
everything
I
could
think
of
to
oblige
him
,
and
to
make
him
appear
,
as
he
really
be
,
a
very
fine
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
order
a
good
quantity
of
such
household
stuff
as
we
yet
want
,
with
linen
of
all
sort
for
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
I
want
very
little
of
clothe
or
linen
,
be
very
well
furnish
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
my
cargo
consist
in
iron
-
work
of
all
sort
,
harness
for
horse
,
tool
,
clothe
for

,
and
woollen

and
whole

,
all
by
direction
of
the
Quaker

and
all
this
cargo
arrive
safe
,
and
in
good
condition
,
with
three
woman
-
servant
,
lusty
wench
,
which
my
old

have
pick
for
me
,
suitable
enough
to
the
place
,
and
to
the
work
we
have
for
them
to
do
;
one
of
which
happen
to
come
double
,
have
be
get

the
seaman
in
the
ship
,
as
she
own
afterwards
,
before
the
ship
get
so
far
as
gravesend
;
so
she
bring
us
a
stout
boy
,
about
seven
month
after
her
landing
.
  
<EOS>
My
husband
,
you
may
suppose
,
be
a
little
surprised
at
the
arriving
of
all
this
cargo
from
England
;
and
talk
with
me
after
he
see
the
account
of
this
particular
,
"
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
I
fear
you
will
run
us
too
deep
in
debt
:
 
when
shall
we
be
able
to
make
return
for
it
all
?
<EOS>
"
I
smile
,
and
tell
him
that
be
be
all
pay
for
;
and
then
I
tell
him
,
that
what
our
circumstance
may
expose
us
to
,
I
have
not
take
my
whole
stock
with
me
,
that
I
have
reserve
so
much
in
my
friend
's
hand
,
which
now
we
be
come
over
safe
,
and
be
settle
in
a
way
to
live
,
I
have
send
for
,
as
he
may
see
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
amazed
,
and
stand
a
while
tell
upon
his
finger
,
but
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
begin
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
hold
,
let
's
see
,
"
say
he
,
tell
upon
his
finger
still
,
and
first
on
his
thumb
;
"
there
be
#
#
#
#
246
in
money
at
first
,
then
two
gold
watch
,
diamond
ring
,
and
plate
,
"
say
he
,
upon
the
forefinger
.
 
<EOS>
then
upon
the
next
finger
,
"
here
be
a
plantation
on
York
River
,
#
#
#
#
100
a
year
,
then
#
#
#
#
150
in
money
,
then
a
sloop
load
of
horse
,
cow
,
hog
,
and
store
"
;
and
so
on
to
the
thumb
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
cargo
cost
#
#
#
#
250
in
England
,
and
worth
here
twice
the
money
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
do
you
make
of
all
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
make
of
it
?
"
say
he
;
<EOS>
"
why
,
who
say
I
be
deceive
when
I
marry
a
wife
in
Lancashire
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
marry
a
fortune
,
and
a
very
good
fortune
too
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
we
be
now
in
very
considerable
circumstance
,
and
every
year
increase
;
<EOS>
for
our
new
plantation
grow
upon
our
hand
insensibly
,
and
in
eight
year
which
we
live
upon
it
,
we
bring
it
to
such
pitch
,
that
the
produce
be
at
least
#
#
#
#
300
sterling
a
year
;
I
mean
,
worth
so
much
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
be
a
year
at
home
again
,
I
go
over
the
bay
to
see
my
son
,
and
to
receive
another
year
's
income
of
my
plantation
;
and
I
be
surprised
to
hear
,
just
at
my
landing
there
,
that
my
old
husband
be
dead
,
and
have
not
be
bury
above
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
I
confess
,
be
not
disagreeable
news
,
because
now
I
could
appear
as
I
be
,
in
a
married
condition
;
so
I
tell
my
son
before
I
come
from
him
,
that
I
believe
I
should
marry
a
gentleman
who
have
a
plantation
near
mine
;
and
though
I
be
legally
free
to
marry
,
as
to
any
obligation
that
be
on
me
before
,
yet
that
I
be
shy
of
it
,
<EOS>
lest
the
blot
should
some
time
or
other
be
revive
,
and
it
may
make
a
husband
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
My
son
,
the
same
kind
,
dutiful
,
and
obliging
creature
as
ever
,
treat
me
now
at
his
own
house
,
pay
me
my
hundred
pound
,
and
send
me
home
again
load
with
present
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
,
I
let
my
son
know
I
be
married
,
and
invite
him
over
to
see
us
,
and
my
husband
write
a
very
obliging
letter
to
him
also
,
invite
him
to
come
and
see
him
;
and
he
come
accordingly
some
month
after
,
and
happen
to
be
there
just
when
my
cargo
from
England
come
in
,
which
I
let
him
believe
belong
all
to
my
husband
's
estate
,
not
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
observe
that
when
the
old
wretch
my
brother
(
husband
)
be
dead
,
I
then
freely
give
my
husband
an
account
of
all
that
affair
,
and
of
this
cousin
,
as
I
have
call
him
before
,
be
my
own
son
by
that
mistaken
unhappy
match
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
easy
in
the
account
,
and
tell
me
he
should
have
be
as
easy
if
the
old
man
,
as
we
call
him
,
have
be
alive
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
no
fault
of
yours
,
nor
of
his
;
it
be
a
mistake
impossible
to
be
prevent
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
only
reproach
him
with
desire
me
to
conceal
it
,
and
to
live
with
him
as
a
wife
,
after
I
know
that
he
be
my
brother
;
that
,
he
say
,
be
a
vile
part
.
 
<EOS>
thus
all
these
difficulty
be
make
easy
,
and
we
live
together
with
the
great
kindness
and
comfort
imaginable
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
grow
old
;
I
be
come
back
to
England
,
be
almost
seventy
year
of
age
,
husband
sixty
-
eight
,
have
perform
much
more
than
the
limited
term
of
my
transportation
;
and
now
,
notwithstanding
all
the
fatigue
and
all
the
misery
we
have
both
go
through
<EOS>
,
we
be
both
of
us
in
good
heart
and
health
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
remain
there
some
time
after
me
to
settle
our
affair
,
and
at
first
I
have
intend
to
go
back
to
him
,
but
at
his
desire
I
alter
that
resolution
,
and
he
be
come
over
to
England
also
,
where
we
resolve
to
spend
the
remainder
of
our
year
in
sincere
penitence
for
the
wicked
life
we
have
live
.
