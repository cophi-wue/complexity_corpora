<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Doctor
Rutter
place
his
taper
on
the
table
,
his
eye
fall
upon
the
blood-
stain
book
,
and
he
utter
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
horror
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
this
just
happen
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
"scarce
<EOS>
half
an
hour
ago

"
reply
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
shut
the
book
,
I
pray
you
,
and
put
it
aside
.
<EOS>
"Doctor
<EOS>
Rutter
obey
,
and
remark
,
as
he
sit
down:"This
portent
must
not
be
disregard
,
my
lord

<EOS>
be
warn
,
I
entreat
you
.
<EOS>
take
no
further
part
in
the
conflict
between
the
king
and
the
rebellious
Parliament
,
but
live
in
quiet
and
retirement
till
the
struggle
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
counsel
will
be
unpalatable
,
but
it
be
prompt
by
duty
to
your
lord
-
ship
.
<EOS>
after
the
spectacle
I
have
just
beheld
,
I
can
not
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
be
warn
,
I
repeat
.
<EOS>
advance
not
on
this
path
of
danger
,
or
it
may
lead
to
your
destruction
.
<EOS>
You
may
share
the
fate
of
Strafford
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
so
,
"
reply
Lord
Strange
;
"
but
I
shall
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
desert
the
king
at
this
juncture
,
even
if
I
be
certain
that
the
direful
consequence
you
predict
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
would
your
fidelity
and
devotion
be
better
appreciate
by
his
majesty
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
all
the
great
effort
you
have
make
for
him
appear
to
have
be
counteract
by
his
adviser
,
several
of
whom
be
evidently
inimical
to
you
.
<EOS>
""You
be
right
,
"
say
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
persuade
the
king
that
I
be
ambitious
,
and
have
pretension
to
the
crown
like
my
uncle
Ferdinando
,
and
they
say
I
shall
desert
him
as
my
ancestor
,
Lord
Stanley
,
desert
,
Richard
the
Third
at
Bosworth
Field
,
when
he
give
the
crown
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
Earl
of
Richmond
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
,
therefore
,
view
my
conduct
with
jealousy
and
suspicion
.
<EOS>
when
I
join
him
at
York
,
I
meet
with
a
cold
reception
,
but
soon
discover
why
I
be
so
treat
,
and
strove
to
disabuse
his
mind
of
his
unjust
and
unfounded
suspicion
.
'
<EOS>
sire
,
'
I
say
,
'
if
it
be
true
that
I
be
plot
against
you
,
I
should
merit
death
.
<EOS>
let
him
who
dare
charge
me
with
<EOS>
treason
stand
forth
,
and
I
will
pick
the
calumny
from
his
lip
with
the
point
of
my
sword
.
'
<EOS>
Lord
Goring
,
Lord
Digby
,
and
Lord
Jermyn
be
present
at
the
time
—
but
not
one
of
them
answer
the
challenge
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
say
the
king
?
"
ask
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"He
pray
me
to
have
patience
;
add
,
'
this
be
not
a
time
,
when
the
rebel
be
march
against
me
,
to
quarrel
amongst
ourselves
.
<EOS>
'""methink
the
rebel
themselves
must
have
see
their
own
advantage
in
the
unworthy
treatment
thus
show
you
,
my
lord
,
"
remark
Rutter
,
"
and
have
seek
to
win
you
over
.
<EOS>
""You
have
guess
right
,
"
say
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
despatch
be
shortly
afterwards
send
me
by
Colonel
Holland
,
commander
of
the
garrison
in
Manchester
,
state
that
he
be
aware
of
the
great
indignity
put
upon
me
by
the
king
's
evil
counsellor
,
who
be
the
enemy
of
the
nation
,
and
that
if
I
would
engage
in
the
cause
of
the
Parliament
,
I
should
have
a
command
equal
to
my
own
greatness
,
or
to
that
of
any
of
my
ancestor
.
<EOS>
My
reply
to
the
insolent
proposition
be
prompt
and
decisive
.
<EOS>
I
bid
the
messenger
tell
Colonel
Holland
,
that
when
he
hear
I
have
turn
traitor
,
I
would
listen
to
his
offer
.
<EOS>
till
then
,
if
I
receive
such
another
despatch
it
would
be
at
the
peril
of
him
who
bring
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
answer
be
worthy
of
you
,
my
lord
,
"
say
the
chaplain
;
"
and
well
calculated
to
put
to
shame
the
king
's
adviser
.
<EOS>
surely
,
after
this
,
his
majesty
could
entertain
no
suspicion
of
you?""an
idea
once
fix
upon
the
king
's
mind
be
not
easily
remove
.
<EOS>
My
motive
have
be
misrepresent
throughout
.
<EOS>
thus
,
when
I
assemble
upward
of
sixty
thousand
efficient
man
on
the
moor
near
Bury
,
Ormskirk
,
and
Preston
,
I
be
authoritatively
forbid
to
take
the
command
of
the
force
,
and
these
potent
auxiliary
be
lose
to
the
king
,
because
they
would
serve
no
other
leader
but
myself
.
<EOS>
many
of
them
go
over
to
the
rebel
.
<EOS>
have
this
large
force
be
retain
,
and
augment
as
it
could
have
be
,
the
king
may
have
march
on
in
triumph
to
London
,
and
have
effectually
crush
the
rebellion
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
lamentable
,
"
remark
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
but
his
majesty
's
eye
have
be
blind
.
<EOS>
""Though
<EOS>
deeply
hurt
by
the
treatment
I
have
experience
,
"
pursue
Lord
Strange
,
"
I
do
not
desist
from
my
effort
,
but
without
delay
raise
three
troop
of
horse
,
and
three
regiment
of
foot
,
which
I
arm
and
equip
,
and
prepare
to
join
the
king
at
Warrington
,
where
it
have
be
agree
that
the
royal
standard
should
be
rear
.
<EOS>
once
more
the
counsel
of
my
enemy
prevail
,
and
to
the
king
's
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
Warrington
,
where
I
be
omnipotent
,
as
I
need
not
tell
you
,
be
abandon
,
and
Nottingham
choose
,
where
I
have
no
influence
whatever
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
without
any
reason
assign
for
the
step
,
I
be
deprive
of
the
lieutenancy
of
Cheshire
and
North
Wales
,
and
Lord
Rivers
be
join
in
commission
with
me
for
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
""i
<EOS>
marvel
your
lordship
could
forgive
the
affront
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
your
loyalty
be
unchangeable
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
not
cease
to
serve
the
king
faithfully
,
even
though
he
should
continue
to
requite
me
with
ingratitude
,
"
say
Lord
Strange
;
"
nor
shall
I
abate
my
zeal
,
even
though
his
cause
should
become
hopeless
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
await
his
majesty
's
order
to
attack
Manchester
.
<EOS>
I
could
easily
have
take
the
place
two
month
ago
,
when
I
seize
upon
the
magazine
,
and
carry
off
the
powder
store
within
it
by
Colonel
Holland
,
but
I
have
no
order
at
the
time
,
and
may
have
be
blame
for
precipitancy
.
<EOS>
since
then
the
town
have
be
fortify
by
an
engineer
name
Rosworm
,
and
it
can
now
stand
a
siege
.
<EOS>
""your
<EOS>
lordship
surprise
me
,
"
observe
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
this
Rosworm
,
of
whom
you
speak
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
hear
of
him
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
very
skilful
german
engineer
,
who
have
have
plenty
of
experience
in
his
own
country
,
where
he
serve
under
Wallenstein
,
"
reply
Lord
Strange
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
Ireland
,
but
on
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
of
the
Roman
Catholics
there
,
he
come
to
England
,
and
find
his
way
to
Manchester
,
where
he
have
be
engage
by
Colonel
Holland
and
the
other
rebel
leader
to
fortify
the
town
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
do
his
work
well
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
hear
of
his
arrival
I
send
messenger
to
offer
him
double
pay
if
he
would
serve
the
king
,
but
he
refuse
to
break
his
engagement
with
the
rebel
.
<EOS>
""that
speak
well
for
his
honesty
at
all
event
,
"
remark
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"ay
,
he
be
a
brave
fellow
,
and
very
skilful
,
as
I
have
just
say
,
"
rejoin
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Manchester
man
be
lucky
in
secure
him
.
<EOS>
that
he
will
make
a
good
defence
of
the
town
I
do
not
doubt
,
but
I
shall
take
it
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
will
be
to
hold
it
when
take
.
<EOS>
Manchester
be
the
most
important
Parliamentary
stronghold
in
the
North
of
England
,
and
every
effort
will
be
make
by
the
rebel
to
recover
it
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
since
I
have
say
so
much
,
I
will
detain
you
for
a
few
minute
longer
while
I
explain
why
I
have
send
for
you
from
the
Isle
of
Man
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
enter
upon
the
matter
till
to
-
morrow
,
but
it
seem
to
me
that
I
have
better
mention
it
now
while
my
mind
be
full
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
""I
be
prepared
to
listen
to
all
you
may
tell
me
,
my
lord
,
"
observe
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
word
,
then
,
"
say
Lord
Strange
,
"
since
it
be
certain
the
Civil
War
have
begin
in
Lancashire
,
and
no
one
can
tell
how
long
it
may
last
,
or
how
it
may
terminate
,
it
be
my
intention
to
garrison
Lathom
House
,
so
that
if
drive
to
extremity
,
I
can
hold
it
for
six
month
or
longer
against
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
as
strong
as
a
castle
,
as
you
know
—
indeed
,
few
castle
in
England
be
so
strong
-
and
from
its
position
,
size
,
fortification
,
and
broad
deep
moat
,
I
be
confident
it
will
stand
a
lengthen
siege
,
if
provide
with
sufficient
man
,
ammunition
,
and
ordnance
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
place
three
hundred
experienced
musketeer
within
the
hall
,
plant
cannon
of
large
size
on
the
wall
and
tower
,
and
provision
it
for
six
month
.
<EOS>
Should
I
be
absent
,
as
may
chance
,
its
custody
will
be
commit
to
my
noble
and
high
-
spirited
wife
,
in
whose
vein
flow
the
blood
of
the
Nassaus
,

whose
courage
well
fit
her
for
the
charge

""that
I
will
answer
for

braver
-
hearted
lady
than
Charlotte
de
la
Trémoille

Lady
Strange

not
exist

<EOS>
I
be
impatient
to
learn
whether
your
lordship

me
to
take
any
part
in
the
preparation
for
the
defence
of
Lathom
House

""Thus
<EOS>
much

You
will
aid
her

with
your
council

act
for
her
as
may
be
needful

as

on
no
man

judgment

place
great
reliance
than
on

while
you

plan
will
be
fully

out

<EOS>
of
necessity

there
altogether

present

-
morrow
you
will
join
her
,

wish
you
fully
to
explain
my
design

if
I
do
not
receive
the
order
I
have

expect
from
his
majesty
to
attack
Manchester

it
be
my
intention
to
go
to
Chester
to
see
my
father
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
have
be
very
unwell
for
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
lordship
,
I
trust
,
be
not
dangerously
ill
?

observe
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
not
,
"
say
Lord
Strange
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
physician
,
Doctor
Gerard
,
from
whom
I
hear
daily
,
tell
me
I
need
not
feel
anxious
about
him
,
and
that
he
be
do
well
,
but
in
spite
of
these
assurance
,
I
be
uneasy
—
very
uneasy
—
for
he
be
old
and
feeble
,
and
may
quickly
sink
.
<EOS>
""It
be
satisfactory
to
reflect
that
the
earl
have
long
be
prepared
to
quit
this
world
,
"
observe
Rutter
,
"
and
have
relinquish
all
his
great
estate
and
power
have
nothing
to
tie
him
to
earth
.
<EOS>
""no
,
he
have
long
do
with
the
world
and
its
vanity

Lord
Strange

<EOS>
"
My
beloved
mother
's
death
be
a
severe
blow
to
him
,
and
he
have
never
recover
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
marvel
not
at
it
,
for

Elizabeth
Vere

Countess

Derby
,
never
exist
.
<EOS>
the
earl
,
my
father
,
have
never
be
himself
since
he
lose
her
.
<EOS>
His
interest
in
life
be
go
—
his
sole
desire
be
to
join
her
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
no
recluse
could
dwell
in
great
retirement
than
he
have
do
,
ever
since
this
sad
bereavement
in
his
house
on
the
bank
of
the
Dee
near
Chester
.
<EOS>
but
his
sorrow
seem
now
draw
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
""Where
grief
be
incurable
,
the
grave
appear
the
only
refuge
,
"
say
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"
under
such
circumstance
prolongation
of
life
be
scarcely
to
be
desire
.
<EOS>
""true
,
"
say
Lord
Strange
.
<EOS>
"
but
we
must
await
the
fatal
stroke
without
impatience
,
and
my
father
,
amid
all
his
suffering
,
have
be
perfectly
resign
to
the
will
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
His
motive
for
surrender
his
estate
to
me
during
his
lifetime
be
that
he
may
pass
the
remainder
of
his
day
in
solitude
and
prayer
.
<EOS>
He
then
firmly
believe
that
his
life
would
not
be
long
,
and
though
he
be
mistaken
,
he
have
never
regret
the
step
.
<EOS>
have
he
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
restore
everything
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
form
a
resolution
,
like
that
of
the
Emperor
Charles
the
Fifth
,
when
he
choose
a
retreat
in
the
monastery
of
Saint
just
,
and
entirely
renounce
the
world
,
its
business
,
pleasure
,
and
trouble
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
do
not
,
like
Charles
the
Fifth
,
practise
all
the
rigours
of
a
monastic
life

"
observe
Doctor
Rutter
.
<EOS>
"he
have
perform
no

for

be
no
part
of
his

"
reply
Lord
Strange
;
"
but
he
have
spend
much
of
his
time
in
religious
meditation
and
prayer

<EOS>
I
would
I
be

well
prepared

""your

It

CHAPTER

an
inner
room
of
an
old
black

white
timber
and
plaster
house
situate
in
a
street
near
the
Collegiate
Church
in
Manchester
,
be
two
person
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
whose
accoutrement
proclaim
him
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
Parliamentary
army
,
be
Colonel
Richard
Holland
,
commander
of
the
garrison
and
governor
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
He
have
strongly
mark
feature
,
and
an
authoritative
manner
,
though
on
the
present
occasion
he
have
somewhat
relax
his
importance
.
<EOS>
His
companion
,
unmistakably
a
foreigner
,
be
no
other
than
the
redoubte
german
engineer
,
of
whom
mention
have
be
previously
make
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
be
about
fifty
,
and
have
serve
under
Wallenstein
during
the
Thirty
Years
'
war
.
<EOS>
but
he
appear
none
the
bad
for
the
hardship
he
have
undergo
.
<EOS>
His
cheek
have
be
gash
at
the
battle
of
Lutzen
,
but
this
circumstance
only
heighten
the
manly
character
of
his
physiognomy
,
and
indeed
the
scar
be
almost
hide
by
a
bushy
red
beard
.
<EOS>
though
his
look
be
determined
and
somewhat
stern
,
his
manner
be
distinguish
by
military
frankness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
call
handsome
but
his
feature
be
well
form
,
and
his
figure
strong
and
well
-
proportion
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
exceed
the
middle
height
,
but
bear
himself
so
well
that
he
look
tall
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
famous
german
engineer
,
to
whom
the
defence
of
Manchester
against
the
Royalists
and
malignant
,
as
they
be
term
,
have
be
entrust
by
those
belong
to
the
Puritan
faction
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
equal
to
the
task
seem
now
conclusively
prove
by
the
effectual
manner
in
which
he
have
fortify
the
town
—
surround
it
entirely
with
mud
wall
,
and
protect
the
entrance
with
stout
post
,
chain
,
and
barricade
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
's
plan
be
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
parliamentary
governor
of
the
town
,
and
he
give
it
his
unqualified
commendation
.
<EOS>
the
house
in
which
we
find
the
engineer
and
the
governor
belong
to
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
have
occupy
it
ever
since
he
arrive
in
the
town
from
Ireland
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
habitation
,
but
quite
large
enough
for
himself
and
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rosworm
be
a
widower
,
have
lose
his
wife
some
year
ago
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
leave
him
a
most
lovely
girl
,
whom
he
guard
with
as
much
vigilance
as
he
would
have
do
a
fortress
.
<EOS>
Gertrude
Rosworm
,
at
the
period
of
our

be
just
nineteen

remarkable
for
her
personal
attraction
.
<EOS>
Her
profuse
flaxen
lock
,
summer
blue
eye
,
delicately
fair
complexion
,
and
graceful
figure
win
her
many
admirer
among
the
youth
of
the
town

but
none
of
them
be
allow
by
her
jealous
father
to
approach
her
.
<EOS>
however
,
further
description
of
her
must
be
defer
till
she
appear
on
the
scene

<EOS>
Colonel

throughout
the

,
the
noble
old
church
,
now
raise
into
a

to
play
an
important
part
in
the

.
<EOS>
the

defend
by
a
low

,
that
offer
a
most
advantageous
position
for
the
musketeer
,
and
combine
with
the
lofty
church-
tower
rise
behind
it
to
render
an
attack
upon

exceedingly
perilous
.
<EOS>
indeed

so
strong
as

by
wall

of

be
the
Reverend
Richard
Heyrick
,
warden
of
the
Collegiate
Church
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
and
feature
indicate
a
proud
and
overbearing
character
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
extremely
popular
among
the
puritanical
faction
in
the
town
by
his
determined
enmity
to
the
Papists
,
and
his
opposition
to
all
the
movement
of
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
Warden
Heyrick

a
man
of
great
eloquence
,
and
unspare
in
his
denunciation
of
Papacy
,
as
an
extract
from
one
of
his
intolerant
exhortation
will
suffice
to
show
.

"

<EOS>
"that
<EOS>
Warden
Heyrick
have
become
friendly
to
Puritanism
,
be
make
manifest
in
a
passage
of
one
of
his
sermon
which
run
thus:—"Of
late
,
I
have
hear
them
much
brand
with
the
name
of
Puritan
that
would
not
yield
up
their
soul
and
conscience
to
the
chair
of
bishop
,
with
their
estate
,
liberty
,
and
live
to
the
will
of
their
superior
.
<EOS>
the
name
be
very
large
and
very
reproachful
.
<EOS>
a
bishop
affirm
he
could
as
well
fetch
one
from
the
guilt
of
felony
as
from
the
imputation
of
Puritanism
.
<EOS>
My
humble
notion
be
,
make
us
all
Puritans
,
or
leave
no
Puritan
among
us!"that
the
warden
foresaw
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
his
infuriate
discourse
we
do
not
believe
,
but
they
do
infinite
mischief
.
<EOS>
Warden
Heyrick
be
a
very
striking
-
looking
personage
—
tall
,
erect
,
and
dignified
in
deportment
,
but
easily
excited
,
when
his
gesture
be
scarcely
under
his
command
,
and
his
eye
seem
to
flash
fire
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
the
Earl
of
Derby
have
entertain
a
very
high
opinion
of
him
,
but
he
look
upon
him
latterly
as
a
mischievous
bigot
.
<EOS>
with
the
warden
be
Mr.
Bourne
,
a
fellow
of
the
Collegiate
Church
,
but
quite
as
puritanical
in
his
opinion
as
Heyrick
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
a
profess
Presbyterian
,
and
have
be
style
from
his
effort
to
reform
the
church

himself
to
encourage
the
townspeople
to
resist
the
popish
besieger
,
as
he
designate
the
force
under
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
a
miracle
seem
to
have
be
work
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
up
to
that
morning
,
he
appear
almost
incapable
of
exertion
,
but
his
strength
suddenly
return
,
and
he

walk
about
almost
without

.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
accompany
by
the
two

Mr.

and
Mr.

who
be
likewise
profess
Presbyterians

<EOS>
by
the
Puritans
Mr.
Bourne
be
regard
with
the
high
respect
,
and
they
declare
he
have
long
be
a
blessing
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
bore
trace
of
the
severe
illness
he
have
endure
,
but
his
hoary
lock
and
beard
give
him
a
very
venerable
appearance
.
<EOS>
while
the

and
Mr.
Bourne
be
converse
with
Colonel

and
Colonel

<EOS>

"Tis

an

Captain

reserve
his
fire

by
which
several

"The

<EOS>
very
little

most
of

be
close

but
all
the

full
of
customer

and
a
good
deal
of
ale

wine
be
consume
.
<EOS>
all

full
of
warlike
excitement
,
and
breathe
vengeance
against
the
malignant

whom
they

Most

some
with

—
some
with

the

It

<EOS>
to
those

nothing

the

when

shout
of

Rosworm
be
not
to

<EOS>
He
feel
that
some
success

but
he
know
that
far
more
must
be
do
,
ere
the

powerful
foe
.
<EOS>
once
more
he
ascend

to
see
how
matter
stand

<EOS>
on
look
towards
Alport

,
he
could
easily
perceive
that
preparation
for
a
general
assault
be
be
actively
make
.
<EOS>
for
the
moment
the
artillerymen
at
the
battery
have
cease
firing
,
but
it
be
evident
they
would
recommence
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
in
Salford
it
be
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
there
the
besieger
be
prepare
for
a
fresh
attack
.
<EOS>
have
obtain
possession
of
a
couple
of
house
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
that
afford
them
shelter
,
they
could
cover
the
advance
of
the
assail
party
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
design
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
become
manifest

<EOS>
determine
not
to
be
baffle
,
he
send
off
a
party
of
man
under
the
command
of
Captain
Windebank
to
set
fire
to
two
large
barn
stand
at
no
great
distance
from
the
wall
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
another
party
be
despatch
to
set
fire
to
eight
or
ten
house
at
the
end
of
Deansgate
.
<EOS>
this
be
do
in
spite
of
the
effort
of
the
besiege
to
prevent
it
,
and
the
house
soon
burst
into
flame
.
<EOS>
as
the
wind
be
blow
at
the
time
from
the
south
-
west
,
the
flame
and
smoke
be
drive
upon
Bradshaw
and
his
man
,
and
almost
blind
them
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
be
fear
that
the
conflagration
would
extend
to
the
town
,
and
such
would
undoubtedly
have
be
the
case
,
have
not
the
wind
suddenly
change
—
a
circumstance
not
unnaturally
regard
as
a
special
providence
.
<EOS>
while
the
fire

rage
,
a
large
party
of
Royalists
,
under
the
command
of
Sir
Gilbert
Gerard
,
make
another
attempt
to
enter
the
town
,
but
be
baffle
by
the
bravery
of
Captain
Bradshaw
and
his
man
,
support
by
a
band
of
musketeer
send
to
their
assistance
by
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
after
a
sharp
encounter
the
Royalists
be
drive
back
with
considerable
loss
.
<EOS>
no
further
attack
be
make
at
the
time
on
the
barrier
and
wall
,
but
the
besieger
have
possess
themselves
of
a
house
at
the

his
way
as
quickly
as
he

soldier
,
accoutre
in
a
buff
coat
and
steel
head
-
piece
,
and
hold
a
musket
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
feature
of
this
youth
,
so
far
as
they
could
be
discern
,
be
almost
feminine
,
and
his
figure
look
too
slight
for
the
martial
task
he
have
undertake
.
<EOS>
still
,
he

stone
wall
that
overlook

the
good
marksman
,
and
occasionally
a
shot
be

<EOS>
on
look
from
the
wall
the
dark
outline
of
the
bridge
could
be
discern
,
and
the
river

<EOS>
the

have
now
take
possession
of
a
house
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
,
and
keep
up
a
constant
fire
against
the
guard
at
the
barrier
,
but
without
do
much
damage

<EOS>
satisfied
with
this
inspection
,
Rosworm
retrace
his
step
.
<EOS>
the
service
be
not

and
the
light
gleam
from
the
paint

of
the

a
very
striking
effect
.
<EOS>
"Thou
hadst

to
his
daughter

"
I

.
<EOS>
the

whereupon
Rosworm

<EOS>
""i

fiercely

as
they
advance
to
execute
the
order

<EOS>
"
You
will
touch
me
at
your
peril
.
"Rosworm
<EOS>
now
deem
it
necessary

<EOS>
"meddle

"
he

"
I
will

let
us
pass

<EOS>
"cranage
<EOS>
do
not
venture
to
offer
any
further
resistance

for
he
fear
he
may
be
reprimand

.
<EOS>
He
therefore
allow
Rosworm
and
his

to
proceed
;
but
when
they
have
get
to
a
certain
distance
,
he
quit
his

<EOS>
He
see
them
proceed
to
Saint
Mary

and
fancy
they
halt
near
the

but
on
arrive
at
this
spot
he
could
see
nothing
of
them

<EOS>
no

inquired

,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
tell
,
"
rejoin
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
see
some
one
with
him
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
so
,
the
person
must
have
leave
him
suddenly
.
<EOS>
""He
have

<EOS>
"
I
believe
it

Colonel
Holland
and
the
Parliament
officer
,
the
siege
should
be
vigorously
carry
on
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
think
it
would
be
well
to
burn
down
the
town
without
delay
than
allow

garrison
to
wait
for
the
reinforcement
,
and
in
this
proposition
the

if
necessary

<EOS>
"
I
be
as
anxious
as
your

that
the
effusion
of
blood
should
be
stay

and
that
the
horror
of
a
civil

should
be
avoid
,
but
this
can

be
accomplish
in
one
way

Hitherto

It
be
idle

to
suppose

shall
surrender
the
town
while

keep
it

<EOS>
the
siege

<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
striking
and
picturesque
than
the
appearance
of
Lathom

at
the
period
of
our

say
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
"
as
if
nature
herself
have
form
it
for
a
stronghold
,
or
place
of
security
.
<EOS>
the
uncommon
situation
of

may
be
compare
to
the
palm
of
a
man

hand
,
flat

middle

and
cover

a
rise
round

"But
<EOS>
for
this
unlooke

for

untoward
incident

"
say
the
earl

"
I
would
have

<EOS>
You

"The
<EOS>
injunction

<EOS>
standish

it

<EOS>
Lord
Derby
and
Lord

be
astounded
at
the
size
of

for
neither

seem
enormous
.
<EOS>
while
note
her
powerful
ordnance

ever

<EOS>
"
the
sure
way
to

to

<EOS>
I
shall

when

young

suddenly
appear
on

in

arm
a
beautiful
spanish
damsel
of
some
eighteen
or
nineteen
.
<EOS>
She
have
faint
,
and
be
closely
follow
by
an
elderly
spanish
gentleman
—
evidently
her
father
—
and
a
female
attendant
.
<EOS>
illustrationa
word
of
explanation
may
here
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
Alava
,
a
spanish
merchant
trading
with
France
,
and
his
daughter
Engracia
,
with
her
attendant
Maria
,
be
be
convey
from
Dunquerque
to
Cadiz
,
and
have
suffer
greatly
from
the
disaster
that
have
befall
the
ship
;
but
they
have
be
still
more
alarm
by
the
visit
of
the
rebel
,
and
have
take
refuge
in
the
cabin
,
carefully
bar
the
door
against
intrusion
.
<EOS>
not
know
what
have
take
place
,
and
imagine
the
rebel
be
still
on
board
,
they
refuse
to
come
forth
from
the
cabin
,
and
may
have
be
leave
there
to
perish
,
have
not
Frank
Standish
burst
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
snatch
up
Engracia
,
who
have
faint
,
as
we
have
say
,
the
young
man
carry
her
on
deck
,
and
be
follow
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
never
have
he
see
such
magnificent
black
eye
as
the
fair
damsel
fix
upon
him
when
she
regain
her
sensibility
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
thank
him
in
word
,
but
her
look
sufficiently
express
her
gratitude
.
<EOS>
what
she
leave
unsaid
,
her
father
supply
,
and
as
he
speak
in
French
the
young
man
understand
him
.
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
Maria
utter
a
cry
,
and
it
appear
that
a
valuable
casket
have
be
leave
behind
.
<EOS>
not
a
moment
must
be
lose
if
it
be
to
be
recover
,
for
the
flame
have
already
burst
forth
,
and
Lord
Derby
reiterate
his
command
that
every
one
should
leave
the
ship
.
<EOS>
despite
the
injunction
,
standish
hurry
back
to
the
cabin
,
but
have
not
return
when
Engracia
with
her
father
and
Maria
be
lower
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Their
uneasiness
,
however
,
be
speedily
dispel
by
see
him
appear
with
the
casket
in
his
hand
,
and
shortly
afterwards
,
on
landing
,
he
have
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
restore
it
to
its
fair
owner
.
<EOS>
pleased
by
his
gallantry
,
Lord
Derby
desire
him
to
conduct
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
to
Rossall
Hall
—
an
order
we
may
be
sure
he
very
readily
obey
,
and
he
be
delighted
to
find
that
he
could
hold
converse
with
Engracia
,
since
,
like
her
father
,
she
speak
French
fluently
.

Rossall
Hall

be
situate
near

not
very
far
off

as

stop
to
look
back
at
the
burn
ship

which
now
be

a
very
striking
spectacle

as
we
have

she
look
far
better
than

damsel

under
similar
circumstance

<EOS>
but
she
be
greatly
aid

the
fan
she
manage
so
well

all
contribute
materially
to
her
attraction

certainly
produce
an
effect
upon
Standish

<EOS>
for
some
little
time
he
ride
by
her
side
,
and
during
that
interval

he
unaccountably
slacken
his
pace

<EOS>
as
Don
Fortunio
rarely
make
a
remark
,
or
look
back
at
them
,
they
may
almost
have
be
alone
.
<EOS>
what
they
talk
about
it
be
scarcely
worth
while
to
inquire
,
but
both
seem
interested
,
and
the
fair
señorita
's
dark
eye
be
occasionally
cast
down
and
her
fan
agitate
.
<EOS>
Maria
,
who
watch
them
from
her
post
behind
the
trooper
,
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
have
fall
in
love
with
each
other
,
and
she
be
not
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
while
pass
through

almost
all

of

<EOS>
a
like
sensation

at
Great
Singleton

Wharles

and
treale

<EOS>
at
the
latter
place
,
the
good
folk
be
inform
by
a
romish
priest
that
the
Spaniards
belong
to
their
own
religion
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
Don
Fortunio
be
treat
with
great
respect
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
they
have
meet
with
no
interruption
.
<EOS>
occasionally
they
overtook
a
party
of
billmen
or
clubman
,
but
all
these
stout
fellow
be
go
to
join
the
Royalist
force
at

on

some
apprehension

the
rebel
garrison
at
Preston

<EOS>
however
,
the
report

unfounded

they
get

<EOS>
Frank
Standish
have
now
no
misgiving
,
and
would
willingly
have
loiter
on

this
could
not

<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
be
oblige
to
push
on

in
order
to
make
up

to
Blackburn

<EOS>
this
be
the
only
danger

they
be
expose

<EOS>
thenceforward
,
so
much
expedition

that
in

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IVHow
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
be
receive
by
the
Countess
of
DerbyAs
Standish
and
his
troop
be
recognise
by
the
guard
,
the
gate
be
throw
open
for
their
admittance
,
and
the
party
ride
in
without
delay
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
cause
as
much
sensation
as
they
have
do
at
different
place
during
the
journey
.
<EOS>
officer
and
man
turn
out
to
gaze
at
the
beautiful
spanish
damsel
.
<EOS>
as
yet
no
news
have
be
receive
of
the
destruction
of
the
dunquerque
ship
<EOS>
,
so
they
could
not
comprehend
whence
she
come
,
but
they
see
she
be
a
lovely
creature
,
and
be
glad
she
have
find
her
way
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
first
to
notice
her
be
Gertrude
Rosworm
,
who
may
have
be
as
favourably
impress
as
the
other
,
if
Standish
have
appear
less
attentive
,
while
assist
the
fair
Spaniard
.
<EOS>
from
that
moment
an
instinctive
feeling
of
jealousy
,
for
which
she
could
scarcely
account
,
be
awaken
in
Gertrude
's
bosom
.
<EOS>
as
to
Engracia
herself
,
she
be
lose
in
admiration
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
chance
that
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
stranger
,
the
Countess
of
Derby
be
in
the
upper
part
of
the
court
-
yard
with
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
inspect
some
soldier
,
and
be
just
about
to
return
to
the
house
,
when
the
Lady
Mary
draw
her
attention
to
the
singularity
of
Engracia
's
costume
,
and
she
at
once
exclaimed:"that
must
be
a
spanish
maiden
.
<EOS>
"next
<EOS>
moment
,
Captain
Standish
come
up
,
and
hastily
explain
all
that
have
occur
,
conclude
with
Lord
Derby
's
message
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
she
hear
it
than
she
desire
that
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
may
be
present
to
her
,
and
receive
them
with
great
affability
and
kindness
,
say
,
that
as
they
have
be
so
warmly
commend
to
her
by
her
lord
,
they
be
heartily
welcome
to
Lathom
.
<EOS>
Don
Fortunio
be
much
strike
by
her
stately
presence
and
dignified
manner
,
but
Engracia
feel
a
certain
awe
of
the
great
lady
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
be
charm
with
the
young
lady
Stanley
,
and
feel
quite
easy
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
equally
well
pleased
with
her
,
and
think
her
the
lovely
creature
they
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
after
a
brief
conversation
with
the
stranger
,
which
it
be
scarcely
needful
to
say
be
conduct
in
French
,
the
countess
lead
them
into
the
house
,
where
,
she
again
bid
them
welcome
,
and
sign
to
Trioche
,
who
be
stand
among
the
other
servant
in
the
hall
,
direct
him
to
conduct
Don
Fortunio
to
a
chamber
which
she
designate
in
the
great
gallery
.
<EOS>
Her
next
thought
be
for
Engracia
,
and
be
aware
that
Gertrude
Rosworm
speak
French
,
she
beg
her
to
take
charge
of
the
fair
spanish
damsel
and
her
attendant
,
and
find
them
a
suitable
bed
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
this
be
soon
do
,
and
Gertrude
be
about
to
leave
them
in
the
room
she
have
choose
,
when
Engracia
beseech
her
to
remain
.
<EOS>
"Do
stay
with
me
a
few
minute
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
be
very
amiable
,
and
will
not
refuse
to

me
some

<EOS>
""excuse

Gertrude

<EOS>
"
I
be

<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>

I
quite
understand

say
Engracia
.
<EOS>

I
have
no
curiosity
to
learn
how
many
soldier
it
contain
—
how
many
cannon
—
or
the
amount
of
its
store
.
<EOS>
I
merely
seek
a
little
information
on
one
or
two
point
.
<EOS>
first
of
all
I
will
venture
to
inquire
whether
there
be
a
priest
in
the
castle
?
<EOS>
I
be
accustomed
to
have
a
confessor
.
<EOS>
""The

""So

add
in

to

Gertrude

"
if
so

you

of

"And

<EOS>
"I

Engracia
to

as
soon

""The

<EOS>
Lord

<EOS>
thereupon

at
that
time
Lancaster
Castle

have
be
strongly
fortify
by
the
parliamentarian
commander
.
<EOS>
the

throng
with
musketeer

and
amongst
its
ordnance
could
be
discern
the
piece
of
cannon
take

<EOS>
thus
much
on

<EOS>
but
even
if
the
town
be
independent
of
the

,
they
,
the

would
never

They

CHAPTER
VIIHow
Lancaster
be
take
by
the
EarlIN
a
very
short
space
of
time
,
the
whole
Royalist
force
,
divide
into
four
squadron
—
each
number
four
hundred
man
—
be
move
towards
the
town
,
but
in
different
direction
,
as
the
attack
be
intend
to
be
make
at
various
point
.
<EOS>
besides
these
,
there
be
the
billman
and
club
-
man
,
who
be
likewise
divide
into
four
company
,
each
have
a
mount
leader
.
<EOS>
the
squadron
command
by
Lord
Molineux
start
first
,
have
a
wide
circuit
to
make
,
and
keep
as
much
as
possible
under
the
cover
of
the
hedge
,
but
it
be
descry
from
the
castle
,
and
form
a
mark
for
the
gun
,
which
now
begin
to
play
upon
the
besieger
.
<EOS>
move
off
with
his
man
towards
the
river
,
Sir
John
Girlington
attack
the
town
on
the
north
.
<EOS>
an
intermediate
point
be
choose
by
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
while
Lord
Derby
march
along
the
high
road
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
he
expose
to
the
fire
of
the
castle
gun
,
but
his
advance
be
dispute
by
Captain
Shuttleworth
and
a
large
body
of
cavalry
.
<EOS>
see
that
a
charge
be
about
to
be
make
,
the
earl
halt
,
and
firmly
receive
the
furious
onset
.
<EOS>
He
then
attack
the
rebel
in
his
turn
,
and
drive
them
back
into
the
town
,
kill
a
great
number
,
and
pursue
them
so
quickly
that
they
could
not
make
another
stand
.
<EOS>
in
vain
Captain
Shuttleworth
endeavour
to
rally
his
man
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
stop
till
they
reach
the
castle
,
and
be
hotly
pursue
by
Standish
and
a
party
of
horseman
better
mount
than
the
rest
,
Shuttleworth
be
cut
down
before
he
could
cross
the
drawbridge
.
<EOS>
this
daring
act
have
well
-
nigh
cost
standish
his
life
.
<EOS>
a
shower
of
bullet
fly
around
him
,
and
it
seem
miraculous
that
he
be
not
hit
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
manage
to
rejoin
Lord
Derby
safe
and
sound
,
and
find
him
engage
in
set
fire
to
several
house
in
the
main
thoroughfare
,
in
order
to
clear
them
of
the
marksman
,
who
do
great
mischief
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
rattle
of
musketry
be
hear
in
other
quarter
,
commingle
with
the
roar
of
the
castle
gun
.
<EOS>
but
the
latter
do
more
harm
to
friend
than
foe
,
and
many
building
be
crush
by
the
ponderous
shot
.
<EOS>
strange
to
say
both
Captain
Verderol
and
Lieutenant
Puntales
,
who
be
with
Lord
Derby
,
be
kill
by
the
discharge
of
a
cannon
take
from
their
own
ship
.
<EOS>
Their
death
infuriate
the
crew
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
butcher
many
unresisting
townspeople
,
and
vow
vengeance
upon
Major
Sparrow
.
<EOS>
They
keep
their
oath
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
three
of
them
,
arm
with
musket
they
have
pick
up
,
contrive
to
reach
the
bank
of
the
moat
unobserved
,
and
perceive
Major
Sparrow
on
the
wall
,
whom
they
recognise
from
have
see
him
when
he
plunder
the
ship
,
they
take
deliberate
aim
,
and
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
town
be
completely
invest
by
the
Royalists
,
who
gain
an
entrance
at
every
point
they
attack
,
and
drive
their
opponent
before
them
make
their
way
to
the
market
-
place
,
where
they
form
a
junction
.
<EOS>
in
accomplish
this
object
they
sustain
comparatively
little
loss
,
but
the
destruction
they
cause
be
terrible
.
<EOS>
the
parliamentary
troop
who
oppose
them
be
force
to
retreat
,
while
the
townspeople
,
many
of
whom
be
favourably
dispose
towards
the
besieger
,
be
ruthlessly
slaughter
,
since
no
quarter
be
give
.
<EOS>
building
be
set
on
fire
in
every
direction
,
and
two
whole
street
be
burn
down
,
but
not
before
the
house
have
be
pillage
by
the
billmen
and
clubman
,
who
claim
the
right
to
plunder
.
<EOS>
for
more
than
three
hour
the
Royalists
be
scatter
in
various
part
of
the
town
,
and
as
they
could
not
be
restrain
by
their
leader
,
the
havoc
be
frightful
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
horror
of
Civil
War
,
like
excess
be
commit
by
both
side
.
<EOS>
during
all
this
time
,
the
gun
of
the
castle
continue
fire
,
but
as
we
have
already
explain
they
do
infinitely
more
damage
to
the
townspeople
than
to
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
strife
cease
,
at
least
in
the
central
part
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
quarter
,
hitherto
refuse
,
be
now
give
in
every
instance
,
to
those
who
submit
.
<EOS>
house
be
still
burn
in
various
part
,
and
pillage
be
still
go
on
,
but
the
firing
from
the
castle
have
cease
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
good
reason
for
the
cessation
,
for
the
supply
of
powder
be
well
-
nigh
exhaust
.
<EOS>
this
circumstance
would
have
render
Colonel
Holcroft
seriously
uneasy
,
if
he
have
not
feel
sure
of
aid
from
Preston
.
<EOS>
no
intelligence
have
be
receive
from
Sir
John
Seaton
,
but
it
could
not
be
doubt
that
when
that
brave
commander
hear
of
Lord
Derby
's
attack
upon
Lancaster
,
he
would
hasten
to
the
assistance
of
the
town
and
garrison
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
be
quite
aware
of
the
difficulty
in
which
the
garrison
be
place
.
<EOS>
He
know
they
not
only
want
powder
and
match
,
but
provision
,
since
several
hundred
of
the
townspeople
have
take
refuge
in
the
castle
,
and
must
be
feed
.
<EOS>
He
also
know
that
the
well
would
soon
be
drain
,
and
the
want
of
water
and
food
must
compel
a
speedy
surrender
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
determine
to
press
the
siege
with
the
utmost
vigour
,
and
be
detail
his
plan
at
a
council
of
war
hold
in
the
town
-
hall
,
when
a
sudden
change
be
cause
by
important
intelligence
bring
him
by
his
scout
from
Preston
.
<EOS>
that
very
night
it
appear
Sir
John
Seaton
be
about
to
march
from
Preston
with
fifteen
hundred
musketeer
and
some
troop
of
horse
to
the
relief
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Lord
Molineux
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
and
the
other
commander
and
captain
who
assist
at
the
council
,
look
aghast
,
but
Lord
Derby
seem
quite
undismayed
.
"Since
<EOS>
Sir
John
Seaton
be
come
to
Lancaster
,
we
must
go
to
Preston
,
"
he
say
;
"
but
by
a
different
route
.
<EOS>
doubtless
,
he
will
march
through
Garstang
.
<EOS>
Our
route
must
,
therefore
,
be
by
Cockerham
,
Kirkland
,
and
Catterall
.
<EOS>
We
will
set
forth
at
dusk
with
our
whole
force
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
dark
in
an
hour

lord

"
say
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
.
<EOS>
"
the
man
be
scatter
about
the
town
,
and
can
not
be
get
together
in
that
time
.
<EOS>
""they
<EOS>
must

"
say
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
Preston
must
be
attack
to
-
night
,
and
before
dawn
it
will
be
in
our
hand
.
<EOS>
""a
<EOS>
bold
stroke
,
and
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
it
will
prove
successful

"
observe
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
"deprive
<EOS>
of
all
its
strength
,
the
town
can
offer
no
resistance
,
and
must
surrender
,
"
say
Sir
John
Girlington
.
<EOS>
"ay
,
the
Royalists
will
not
be
afraid
to
declare
themselves
,
"
say
Lord
Molineux
.
<EOS>
"they
will
welcome
us
as
deliverer

Sir
Gilbert
Hoghton

Sir
John

and

secretly
out
of

town
,
as
Lord

<EOS>
the
chief
difficulty
be
with
the
billmen
and
clubman
,
who
be
very
reluctant
to
abandon
their
spoil
,
but
be
tell
that
they
would
certainly
be
cut
to
piece
if

there
by
Sir
John
Seaton

they
content
themselves
with
what
they
could
carry
off
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derby
be
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
but
the
other
be
not
long
behind

<EOS>
It
be
now
dark
,
but
from
this
point
the
town

a
terrible
spectacle
.
<EOS>
many
house
be
still
burn
in
various
quarter
,
and
a
lurid
light
be
throw
on
the
wall
and
keep
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Dreadful
as
be
the
scene
,
it
produce
little
effect
upon
the
beholder
,
most
of
whom
rejoice
to
think
that
Sir
John
Seaton
would
find
the
town
untenable
on
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
force
be
complete

the
order
to
march
be

up
the
rear

<EOS>
the
road
to
Cockerham
be
take
,
and
as
they
be
now
close
to
the
bay
,
and
the
tide
out
,
the
broad
sand
could
be
distinguish
through
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
nothing
occur
till
they
reach
Cockerham
Moss
,
and
as
they
skirt
it
,
the
sound
of
horse
be
hear
behind
,
and
they
know
they
be
pursue
.
<EOS>
on
this
alarm
,
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
halt
,
and
immediately
wheel
round
,
await
the
horseman
,
whom
he
do
not

come
from

<EOS>
Lord
Derby
's
departure
have
not
be
accomplish
with
so
much
secrecy
as
to
escape
the
notice
of
the
garrison
,
and
Colonel
Holland
find
that
the
whole
of
the
Royalists
have
evacuate
the
town
,
and
probably
set
out
for
Preston
,
start
in
pursuit
with
a
large
party
of

to
harass
them
.
<EOS>

the
route
they

he

time
in

and
then
make
a
sudden
dash
forward
,
but
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
be
prepare
,
drive
him
back
with
the
loss
of
several
man
,
and
the
colonel
do
not

another
attack

<EOS>
thenceforward
,
the
march
of
the
Royalists

mount
trooper

back
that
Sir
John
Seaton
with
his

halt
at
Garstang
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
Lord
Derby
's
intention
,
as
we
have
show

to
surprise
Preston
that
night
,
but
as
he
proceed
,
he
learn
from
his
scout
that
the
Royalists
have
begin
to
display
a
bold
front
against
the
few
Parliamentarians
in
the
town
,
so
that
he
should
be
able
to
take
possession
of
it
almost
without
a
blow
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
postpone
the
attack
till
the
morrow
,
and
halt
for
the
night
at
Fulwood
Moor
,
on

north
of

day
after

have
capture

<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
now
a
proposition

make
to
you

"
he
say

<EOS>
"
this
success
must
be
immediately
follow
up
.
<EOS>
before
the
rebel
can
recover
from
their
surprise
we
must
strike
another
and
heavy
blow
.
<EOS>
We
must
attack
Manchester
with
the
fix
determination
of
take
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
we
shall
be
successful
.
<EOS>
this
very
night
we
must
start
on
the
enterprise

<EOS>
if
we
tarry
here
we

have
to
defend
ourselves
against
Sir
John
Seaton

most
assuredly
will
besiege

not

your
lordship
that
it
will
be
good
to
leave
Preston
,
"
say
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
;
"
<EOS>

I
think
it
be
your
intention
to
take
Blackburn
,
and
then
proceed
to
Bolton

<EOS>
""Manchester
be
far
more
important
than
either
Blackburn

Bolton

rejoin
the
earl

if
I
march
against

Will

<EOS>
""I
be
bind

<EOS>
the
Earl

first
business
on
his
arrival
be
to
have
an
interview
with
the
governor
,
and
have
explain
the
position
of
affair
,
he
throw
himself
on
a
couch
,
and
seek
some
repose
of
which
he
stand
greatly
in
need
.
<EOS>
when
he
awake
,
he
learn
from
the
scout
that
the
enemy
be
advance
with
the
evident
intention
of
invest
the
town
,
and
attack
it
on
two
side
—
the
force
on
the
west
be
lead
by
Colonel
Assheton
,
that
on
the
east
by
Colonel
Holland
,
with
whom
be
Colonel
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
on
receive
this
intelligence
,
the
earl
immediately
sally
forth
at
the
head
of
a
large
troop
of
horse
,
and
attack
Colonel
Assheton
near
Sankey
Bridge
,
drive
him
back
as
far
as
Burton
Wood
;
and
he
may
have
route
the
whole
force
,
have
not
Colonel
Holland
send
a
detachment
to
Assheton
's
aid
,
and
Lord
Derby
be
thereupon
compel
to
return
to
the
town
,
or
his
retreat
would
have
be
cut
off
.
<EOS>
not
long
afterwards
the
assault
be
commence
by
Colonel
Holland
,
assist
as
we
have
say
by
Rosworm
,
and
notwithstanding
the
vigorous
defence
make
by
Colonel
Norris
,
part
of
the
mud
wall
be
take
,
and
it
seem
certain
that
the
enemy
would
succeed
in
penetrate
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
be
ride
about
on
his
charger
,
declare
that
rather
than
the
enemy
should
capture
the
town
,
he
would
burn
it
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
when
Colonel
Holland
and
Rosworm
hear
of
this
threat
,
they
laugh
at
it
,
and
redouble
their
effort
to
advance
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
stop
by
loud
explosion
,
which
prove
that
several
house
have
be
blow
up
,
and
flame
be
soon
afterwards
perceive
burst
forth
in
different
quarter
.
<EOS>
the
earl
have
execute
his
threat
.
<EOS>
all
the
habitation
near
them
be
on
fire

the
conflagration
,

by
combustible
,
be
rapidly
extend
along
the
main
street
.
<EOS>
strike
with
consternation
at
this
spectacle
,
the
assailant
pause
in
their
effort
,
and
consider
what
should
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
now
to
advance
without
expose
themselves
to
the
great
risk
—
indeed
,
to
almost
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
besides
,
as
the
town
would
inevitably
be
burn
down
,
little
would
be
leave
them
but
the
mud
wall
.
<EOS>
from
information
which
they
obtain
,
they
learn
that
Lord
Derby
and
Colonel
Norris
,
with
a
large
body
of
man
,
have
retire
to
the
church
,
where
they
be
secure
from
the
fire
,
as
well
as
from
attack
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
the
assailant
judge
it
their
wise
course
to
retire
for
the
night
to
Sankey
,
and
wait
to
see
what
the
morrow
would
bring
forth
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
night
of
terror
and
surprise
.
<EOS>
More
than
half
the
town
be
on
fire
,
but
no
effort
be
make
by
the
inhabitant
to
extinguish
the
flame
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
have
cross
the
bridge
,
and
find
shelter
at
Groppenhall
,
Thelwall
,
and
other
village
.
<EOS>
but
the
besieger
be
not
allow
to
rest
at
Sankey
.
<EOS>
at
midnight
the
sentinel
be
shoot
,
and
the
Parliamentarians
,
who
have
fancy
themselves
in
security
,
be
suddenly
rouse
to
arm
.
<EOS>
the
foe
be
upon
them
.
<EOS>
a
fierce
fight
ensue
that
last
more
than
two
hour
,
and
end
in
a
complete
rout
of
the
Parliamentarians
,
part
of
whom
return
to
Wigan
,
and
the
rest
to
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Warrington
be
thus
deliver
from
the
rebel
,
and
though
the
town
suffer
as
much
as
it
would
have
do
have
it
be
ravage
by
the
enemy
—
<EOS>
perhaps
more
—
not
a
murmur
be
hear
from
the
loyal
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
every
assistance
in
his
power
be
render
them
by
the
earl
,
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
day
many
partly
consume
dwelling

again
render
habitable

some
fear
be

be
now
in
the
hand
of
the
parliamentary
leader
,
no
attack
have
as
yet
be
make
on
Lathom
House
.
<EOS>
Its
real
strength
not
be
know
,
it
be
think
the
castle
could
be
easily
take
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
though
the
countess
have
not
be
disturb
,
she
be
virtually
a
prisoner
in
her
own
house
,
and
never
stir
forth
without
a
guard
.
<EOS>
She
make
no
display
whatever
,
but
be
always
secretly
increase
the
strength
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
castle
,
which
be
a
small
town
in
itself
,
be
in
a
perfect
state
of
defence
,
and
quite
capable
of
stand
a
lengthen
siege
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
the
surrender
of
Warrington
,
a
summon
be
send
by
Colonel
Holland
,
the
Governor
of
Manchester
,
to
the
countess
,
require
her
to
acknowledge
the
Parliament
,
or
deliver
up
her
mansion
,
but
to
this
demand
she
return
a
haughty
and
peremptory
refusal
.
<EOS>
"take
back
this
message
to

,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do

.
<EOS>
I

and
only

defend
myself
.
<EOS>
all
I
desire
be
to
remain
here
peaceably
,
and
I
trust
I
shall
not
be
disturb
.
<EOS>
"This
response
seem
reasonable
to
Colonel
Holland
,
and
for
a
time
she
continue
unmoleste
.
<EOS>
not
desire
to
give
the
enemy
a
pretext
for
assail
her
,
the
countess

her
garrison
from

them
any
provocation
,
and
forbid
them
to
plunder
any
house
belong
to
Parliamentarians
,
or
commit
any
outrage
whatever
.
<EOS>
They
may
defend
themselves
,
but
must
not
make
reprisal
.
<EOS>
by
this
judicious
conduct
she
remain
free
from
attack
,
and
be
enable
to
strengthen
herself
,
and
add
to
her
store
.

this
time

number
of
the
garrison

many
of
whom
be
expert

several

<EOS>
the
majority
be

but
some

piece
and
screw
gun
.
<EOS>
sixteen

the
good
marksman

watch
on
every
alternate
night
,
while
an
equal
number
of
musketeer
occupy
the
tower
during
the
day
,
in
addition
to
the
engineer
who
have
charge
of
the
cannon
.
<EOS>
besides
Standish
,
there
be
five
officer
,

we
have
already

but
it
may
be
proper
to
call

the
roll
again
.
<EOS>
all
be

<EOS>
Chief
in
command
be
William
Farrington
of
Worden
,
appoint
major
of
the
garrison
by
the
countess
.
<EOS>
He
have
suffer
much
for
his
attachment
to
Lord
Derby
and
loyalty
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
colonel
of
militia
,
and
a
commissioner
of
array
,
but
his
good
be
seize
and
his
property
sequester
by
the
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Major
Farrington
be
a
man
of
excellent
judgment
,
and
the
countess
have
entire
reliance
upon
him
,
and
consult
him
on
all
occasion
.

the
great
order
and
discipline
prevail
.
<EOS>
not
one
person
have
be
punish
for
disobedience
or
neglect
of
duty
.
<EOS>
already
,
we
have
endeavour
to
familiarise
the
reader
with
the
appearance
of
this
proud
embattle
mansion
,
with
its
wide
court
,
its
circuit
of
wall
,
its
great
gate
-
tower
,
its
broad
moat
,
strengthen
by
stout
palisade
on
either
bank
,
and
,
above
all
,
its
lofty
central
tower
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
again
refer
to
the
picture
,
in
order
to
notice
a
marked
change
that
have
take
place
in
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
though
more
strongly
garrisoned
than
formerly
,
Lathom
look
less
menacing
.
<EOS>
in
each
tower
on
the
wall
be
six
piece
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
but
neither
engineer
nor
musketeer
be
visible
.
<EOS>
They
be
there
,
but
do
not
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
only
on
the
gate
-
tower
could
the
guard
be
distinguish
.
<EOS>
no
banner
float
as
of
yore
from
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
,
and
the
sentinel
seem
to
have
be
remove
.
<EOS>
but
these
appearance
be
deceptive
.
<EOS>
strict
watch
be
keep
night
and
day
on
tower
and
rampart
,
and
on
every
part
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
that
officer
and
man
find
this
inactive
life
wearisome
be
certain
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
prefer
annoy
the
enemy
by
an
occasional
sortie
,
but
Major
Farrington
,
act
upon
the
countess
's
instruction
,
would
not
permit
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
resolve
not
to
provoke
assault
.
<EOS>
It
surprise
her
that
the
enemy
allow
her
to
remain
quiet
so
long
,
but
she
would
not
precipitate
matter
.

He

VIIIHow
the
intrenchment
be
madeBY
this
time
the
Parliamentarians
have
take
up
their
quarter
at
various
point
round
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Rigby
be
encamp
near
Newburgh
,
Colonel
Moore
on
the
road
to
Ormskirk
,
and
Colonel
Assheton
and
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
on
the
south
side
,
where
the
tent
could
be
descry
amongst
the
tree
.
<EOS>
the
besieger
now
number
a
force
of
more
than
two
thousand
man
—
five
hundred
horse
,
and
fifteen
hundred
foot
—
quite
sufficient
,
it
be
think
,
for
the
reduction
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
mansion
be
now
completely
invest
,
party
of
man
be
post
so
closely
together
that
all
communication
with
friend
be
cut
off
.
<EOS>
already
the
line
have
be
mark
out
by
the
engineer
,
and
the
pioneer
have
commence
dig
the
trench
.
<EOS>
They
be
assist
by
several
hundred
sturdy
yeoman
and
hind
,
all
of
them
be
Lord
Derby
's
tenant
or
servant
,
who
be
force
by
threat
and
blow
to
do
work
that
be
most
distasteful
to
them
.
<EOS>
some
of
these
poor
fellow
break
away
and
run
towards
the
castle
,
but
the
mount
guard
gallop
after
them
and
bring
them
back
.
<EOS>
the
intrenchment
be
begin
at
night
at
the
distance
of
a
musket
-
shoot
from
the
mansion
,
and
in
a
place
screen
by
the
rise
ground
from
the
ordnance
on
the
tower
,
and
the
pioneer
and
their
assistant
labour
so
hard
that
before
dawn
considerable
progress
have
be
make
.
<EOS>
concealment
be
then
no
longer
possible
,
and
fire
be
open
upon
them
from
the
wall
of
the
castle
,
but
little
mischief
be
do
.
<EOS>
from
this
time
the
work
proceed
rapidly
,
be
continue
night
and
day
without
intermission
.
<EOS>
a
deep
trench
,
shelter
by
a
breastwork
of
earth
,
gradually
encircle
the
mansion
,
and
imprison
its
occupant
.
<EOS>
constant
attack
be
make
on
the
pioneer
,
but
no
real
interruption
be
effect
,
and
the
work
go
on
.
<EOS>
post
on
the
Eagle
Tower
,
the
countess
view
the
progress
of
this
work
with
ill
-
suppress
rage
,
but
without
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
in
this
exalted
position
,
she
be
out
of
reach
of
the
enemy
's
gun
,
for
as
yet
no
large
piece
of
ordnance
have
be
direct
against
the
house
,
and
all
shot
have
be
fire
against
the
rampart
.
<EOS>
no
serious
assault
,
however
,
have
be
make
;
nor
do
any
such
seem
intend
.
<EOS>
evidently
,
the
design
of
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
and
the
other
parliamentary
leader
,
be
to
terrify
the
countess
into
submission
,
but
if
they
could
have
see
her
on
the
Eagle
Tower
,
with
Major
Farrington
,
Archdeacon
Rutter
,
and
her
daughter
,
they
would
have
feel
she
would
not
be
easily
intimidate
.
<EOS>
Her
sole
feeling
be
that
of
anger
against
her
foe
,
and
an
almost
irrepressible
desire
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
far
too
prudent
not
to
check
the
impulse
.
<EOS>
not
unfrequently
,
be
Gertrude
Rosworm
present
,
and
if
her
sentiment
could
be
judge
by
her
flashing
eye
,
she
share
the
countess
's
indignation
,
and
long
to
assail
the
besieger
.
<EOS>
from
this
eminent
position
,
the
beholder
not
only
overlook
the
rise
ground
on
the
further
side
of
the
moat
,
and
the
breastwork
of
the
trench
,
but
could
distinguish
the
pioneer
and
their
assistant
at
work
.
<EOS>
They
see
the
parliamentary
commander
ride
from
point
to
point
,
each
with
a
troop
of
horse
;
they
see
the
numerous
party
of
infantry
post
around
;
and
they
likewise
descry
in
the
distance
the
different
encampment
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
gaze
at
this
picture
,
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
whom
they
easily
recognise
,
ride
round
the
intrenchment
,
follow
by
a
troop
of
horse
.
<EOS>
He
be
attend
by
Colonel
Browne
,
the
chief
engineer
,
and
Colonel
Morgan
,
and
halt
ever
and
anon
to
inspect
the
work
.
<EOS>
several
shot
be
fire
at
him
,
and
though
he
escape
,
two
of
his
man
be
kill
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
seem
in
the
slight
degree
disturb
by
these
occurrence
,
but
continue
his
inspection
quietly
,
as
if
nothing
have
happen
.
<EOS>
the
countess
could
not
help
admire
his
coolness
and
courage
,
and
she
be
still
watch
him
as
he
move
on

when
Captain

"I

It

Most

""You

should
caution
her
not

herself
too
much

Rosworm

<EOS>
"
at
present
we
have
no

still
in

pace
to

over
what

out

in

and
without
wait
to
be
thank
,
march
on
.
<EOS>
the
incident
do
not
occupy
more
than
a
minute
,
so
that
if
notice
by
the
musketeer
on
the
rampart
,
it
be
not
likely
to
excite
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
continue
his

time
longer
,

then
repair
to
his

and
find
—
as
he
expect
—
that
it
contain
a
letter

write
on
very
thin
paper
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
the
handwriting
<EOS>
be
that
of
Captain
Bootle

as
the
word
be
trace
in
pencil

he
do
not
feel
quite
sure

thus:"Means

and
offer
a
marked
contrast
to
the
insolent
deportment
that

and
it
be
the

that
night

and
a

and

them
on

<EOS>
next
morning
the
cannonier
on
the
opposite

try
ineffectually
to
dislodge
these
piece

ordnance

<EOS>
several
shot
be

from
the

battery
against
the

without

two

and
a
musketeer
who
imprudently
show
himself
on

rampart
be
kill
.
<EOS>
this
be
regard
as
a
great
achievement
by
the
enemy
,
who
raise
a
loud
shout
;
but
their
exultation
be
soon
over
,
for
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
two
of
the
cannonier
be
kill
.
<EOS>
another
sortie
be
make
that
night
by
Standish
and
chisenhale
,
accompany
by
fifty
musketeer
—
their
object
be
to
dismount
the
two
piece
of
cannon
that
have
give
the
garrison
so
much
trouble
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
after
a
sharp
conflict
with
the
guard
,
during
which
Captain
Chisenhale
be
slightly
wound
,
they
succeed
in
accomplish
their
design
.
<EOS>
Their
triumph
would
have
be
complete
,
if
they
could
have
bring
the
two
gun
away
with
them
,
but
this
be
impracticable
.
<EOS>
the
besieger
now
begin
to
show
more
activity
and
determination
than
they
have
hitherto
display
.
<EOS>
provoke
at
the
destruction
of
their
little
battery
,
they
bring
up
a
basilisk
and
a
saker
,
two
piece
of
ordnance
of
small
calibre
than
a
culverin
,
and
plant
them
against
the
gate

tower

misdirected
shot
from

basilisk
enter
the
wicket

and
kill
one
of

but
do
not
find
its
way
to
the
court

<EOS>
immediately
afterwards
the
gate

throw
open

and
the
drawbridge
lower
,
and
a
party
of
horseman
head
by
Standish
dash
out
provide
with

<EOS>
seize
the

<EOS>
not
a
single
man
be
lose
on
the
occasion

<EOS>
Hitherto
,
the
Royalists
have
be
uniformly
successful
,
and
have
baffle
all
the
attempt
of
the
enemy
,
generally
inflict
severe
loss
upon
them
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
feel
that
these
constant
defeat
would
only
make
the
besieger
more
determined
,
and
that
their
effort
to
take
the
mansion
would
be
redouble
.
<EOS>
the
besiege
have
no
fear
of
such
a
result
,
but
to
prevent
it
the
utmost
vigilance
and
activity

require

CHAPTER
XVIIOf
the
Preparations
make
for
a
Grand
sortieby
this
time
the
work
of
the
besieger
have
make
great
progress
.
<EOS>
bulwark
have
be
cast
up
,
but
as
yet
all
the
battery
have
not
be
mount
with
cannon
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
certain
that
a
mine
have
be
commence
,
which
it
be
intend
should
pass
under
the
moat
,
either
for
the
purpose
of
blow
up
some
of
the
tower
,
or
cut
off
the
water
.
<EOS>
as
the
deep
well
from
which
the
garrison
be
abundantly
supply
be
situate
in
the
very
centre
of
the
castle
,
it
would
necessarily
take
the
miner
some
time
to
reach
it
,
and
it
be
resolve
to
sink
a
countermine
to
meet
them
as
soon
as
their
course
could
be
discover
.
<EOS>
engineer
be
,
therefore
,
post
in
various
place
to
listen
for
any
sound
that
may
guide
them
in
their
task
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
these
disquiet
circumstance
the
courage
of
the
countess
remain
unshaken
,
and
,
indeed
,
rise
higher
than
ever
.
<EOS>
nor
be
uneasiness
manifest
by
any
one
in
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
even
those
not
engage
in
its
defence
be
full
of
ardour
.
<EOS>
but
the
person
most
interested
in
the
siege
be
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
show
,
she
take
an
active
part
in
the
defence
of
the
house
—
carry
message
and
order
—
mount
rampart
and
tower
—
and
watch
the
cannonier
when
he
point
his
gun
,
and
would
have
do
more
if
she
have
be
permit
.
<EOS>
Her
great
desire
be
to
attend
a
sortie
,
and
she
would
have
accompany
the
first
expedition
habit
in
male
attire
,
if
the
countess
would
have
allow
her
.
<EOS>
with
this
recklessness
,
she
now
pass
hour
in
the
postern
-
tower
,
account
the
most
dangerous
part
of
the
castle
,
be
most
expose
to
a
sudden
assault
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
here
she
could
watch
the
progress
of
their
fortification
,
and
could
count
the
saker
,
the
perier
,
the
minion
,
and
falconet
on
their
battery
.
<EOS>
one
morning
while
engage
in
her
survey
she
perceive
that
the
besieger
have
begin
a
new
fort
on
which
they
be
most
diligently
employ
.
<EOS>
fix
on
the
summit
of
a
rise
ground
at
a
short
distance
on
the
south
-
west
,
it
command
the
whole
of
the
mansion
;
but
the
position
be
too
high
for
cannon
<EOS>
,
it
be
evident
the
battery
be
intend
for
a
mortar
,
or
a
bombard
,
the
sconce
be
circular
,
and
surround
by
a
rampart
,
which
,
as
yet
,
be
unfinished
.
<EOS>
on
make
this
discovery
,
Gertrude
hasten
to
the
countess
,
but
her
ladyship
have
already
be
inform
of
the
new
fort
by
Major
Farrington
and
Standish
,
and
have
give
order
that
it
should
be
destroy
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
accordingly
the
cannonier
have
just
open
fire
,
and
have
kill
two
of
the
man
,
and
drive
away
the
rest
,
be
knock
down
the
rampart
.
<EOS>
"We
may
check
the
work
for
a
time
,
"
say
standish
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
certain
it
will
be
resume
on
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
""no
<EOS>
doubt
the
sconce
be
design
for
the
large
mortar
,
with
which
we
have
be
threaten
,
"
observe
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"The
monster
shall
be
silence
as
soon
as
he
begin
to
roar
,
"
say
standish
.
<EOS>
"
meantime
,
we
must
make
another
sortie
,
and
destroy
the
work
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
have
be
too
long
unmolested
,
and
have
grow
insolent
.
<EOS>
""i
approve
of
your
design
,
"
say
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
but
this
time
,
you
must
take
a
large
party
with
you
,
and
do
the
work
effectually
.
<EOS>
how
say
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
she
add
,
to
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
half
the
garrison
should
go
forth
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
""I
be
quite
of
your
ladyship
's
opinion
,
"
reply
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
inflict
a
blow
upon
them
,
calculate
to
shake
their
overweening
confidence
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
rejoin
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
near
approach
of
those
fort
and
battery
be
unpleasant
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
Captain
Standish
the
command
of
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
""in
an
affair
of
this
kind

wherein
so
large
a

more

one
leader
will

"
say
Major
Farrington

<EOS>
"
I
therefore
propose
—
with
your

to

the
party

""You

the

and
I
trust
Captain
Standish
be
satisfied
with
the
arrangement

<EOS>
""perfectly

I
could
desire
no

before

I

""let

"First

Should

that
the
enemy
suspect
the
meditate
attack
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
unusual
movement
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
the
morning
be
bright
and
clear
,
and
he
could
perceive
every
object
distinctly
,
without
the
aid
of
a
spy
-
glass
,
though
he
have
one
with
him
.
<EOS>
four
camp
be
in
view
,
but
there
be
no
unwonted
stir
in
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
man
assemble
in
answer
to
the
morning
call
,
and
he
likewise
beheld
small
party
move
towards
the
trench
and
fortification
to
relieve
guard
.
<EOS>
but
the
number
be
not
great
than
usual
,
nor
do
the
besieger
quicken
their
march
.
<EOS>
satisfied
with
this
distant
survey
,
he
next
examine
the
fortification
,
that
now
completely
encircle
the
besieged
mansion
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
these
earth-
work
and
battery
,
though
ill
-
provide
with
cannon
,
present
a
very
formidable
appearance
,
and
it
seem
absolutely
necessary
for
the
security
of
the
place
that
they
should
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
Captain
Foxe
have
just
complete
his
survey

when
turn
round
he
perceive

.
<EOS>
on
return
to
the
countess
she
tell
her
what
she
have
hear
,
and
the
devout
dame
be
free
from
all
immediate
anxiety
,
proceed
with
her
daughter
to
the
chapel
,
which
be
crowd
with
musketeer
fully
equip
for
the
conflict
,
and
present
a
very
striking
sight
.
<EOS>
never
have
Archdeacon
Rutter
preach
a
more
animated
sermon
than
he
do
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
on
the
conclusion
of
the
service
,
the
three
party
of
musketeer
,
each
under
the
command
of
a
captain
and
lieutenant
,
be
draw
up
in
the
outer
court
,
and
after
the
countess
have
address
a
few
word
to
them
calculate
to
rouse
their
ardour
,
they
prepare
to
sally
forth
upon
the
foe
.
<EOS>
as
the
attack
,
though
make
from
various
point
,
be
to
be
simultaneous
,
it
be
no
sooner
ascertain
that
the
two
squadron
under
the
command
of
Captain
Farmer
and
Captain
Molineux
Radcliffe
be
ready
to
issue
from
the
sally
-
port
in
the
postern

than
the
gate
be
throw
open
,
and
the
drawbridge
lower
,
and
Standish
and
his
man
dash
out
,
while
Captain
Ogle
with
another
party
of
musketeer
,
block
up
the
gateway
,
so
as
to
prevent
all
ingress
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
wall
be
throng
with
marksman
,
under
the
command
of
Captain
Rawsthorne
and
Lieutenants
Walthew
and
Halsall
.
<EOS>
the
engineer
in
every
tower
stand
beside
their
gun
with
light
match
in
hand
,
and
only
await
the
order
to
fire
.
<EOS>
need
we
add
that
Captain
Foxe
be
at
his
post?just
before
the
attack
begin
,
the
countess
appear
on
the
Eagle
Tower
,
attend
by
Gertrude
.
<EOS>
Captain
Foxe
do
not
allow
himself
to
be
distract
by
their
presence
,
but
keep
a
careful
look
out
.
<EOS>
illustrationfor
a
few
minute
the
countess
and
her
attendant
speak
not
a
word
,
and
strange
to
say
,
scarcely
a
sound
seem
to
reach
them
from
beneath
.
<EOS>
Their
gaze
be
rivet
upon
the
postern
-
tower
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
the
sally
-
port
be
open
,
and
from
it
pour
out
with
astonishing
rapidity
a
large
band
of
musketeer
with
Captain
Farmer
at
their
head
.
<EOS>
while
they
be
form
,
another
party
come
forth
with
equal
quickness
,
under
the
command
of
Captain
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
before
commence
the
attack
,
the
two
leader
turn
their
gaze
towards
the
Eagle
Tower
,
and
see
that
Captain
Foxe
wave
the
red
flag
to
them
to
advance
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
enemy
have
take
the
alarm
,
and
be
gather
thickly
in
their
fortification
,
whence
they
fire
upon
their
assailant
,
but
could
not
check
them
in
their
onset
.
<EOS>
sustain
by
the
musketeer
and
marksman
on
the
rampart
of
the
mansion
,
who
be
admirably
direct
by
Captain
Rawsthorne
,
the
assailant
scale
these
bulwark
,
and
drive
the
engineer
from
their
gun
,
kill
several
,
and
fire
with
deadly
effect
upon
the
soldier
who
come
to
their
relief
.
<EOS>
while
the
conflict
be
rage
in
this
quarter
,
Captain
Standish
,
who
have
issue
with
his
man
from
the
gateway
,
have
attack
another
part
of
the
work
,
and
with
equal
bravery
and
success
.
<EOS>
the
attack
have
not
last
more
than
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
already
he
have
gain
two
battery
,
and
kill
three
man
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
but
his
main
object
be
to
spike
the
great
mortar
,
and
leave
Lieutenant
Bretergh
and
those
with
him
to
deal
with
the
cannon
on
the
battery
,
he
force
his
way
to
the
rise
ground
on
which
the
huge
piece
of
ordnance
be
place
.
<EOS>
an
attempt
be
make
by
the
enemy
to
defend
this
little
fort
,
but
nothing
could
resist
the
impetuosity
of
Standish
and
his
follower
.
<EOS>
in
an
inconceivably
short
space
of
time
they
climb
the
rampart
,
and
put
the
engineer
to
the
sword
after
a
brief
struggle
,
and
be
consequently
master
of
the
fort
.
<EOS>
this
daring
exploit
,
witness
from
the
wall
and
tower
of
the
mansion
,
be
hail
with
shout
.
<EOS>
strike
the
wide
-
mouthed
and
ponderous
piece
of
ordnance
with
his
sword
,
and
regret
that
its
enormous
weight
prevent
its
removal
,
Standish
order
it
to
be
spike
,
and
the
work
be
effectually
perform
by
one
of
the
man
who
have
come
provide
with
a
smith
's
hammer
and
nail
.
<EOS>
while
this
be
go
on
,
Standish
look
up
at
the
Eagle
Tower
and
perceive
that
Captain
Foxe
be
give
him
a
signal
to
retreat
by
wave
a
white
flag
in
such
a
manner
as
to
intimate
that
a
large
body
of
the
enemy
be
advance
from
the
camp
.
<EOS>
compel
,
however
,
to
tarry
for
a
few
minute
longer
,
Standish
look
around
,
and
witness
the
end
of
a
sharp
conflict
between
Lieutenant
Worral
and
the
occupant
of
an
adjoining
battery
.
<EOS>
have
spring
suddenly
into
the
work
,
sword
in
hand
,
the
valiant
lieutenant
have
be
instantly
surround
by
a
host
of
his
foe
,
but
he
manage
to
defend
himself
against
them
all
till
Captain
Farmer
come
to
his
assistance
and
deliver
him
.
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
standish
catch
sight
of
his
friend
,
and
respond
to
their
shout
of
triumph
by
wave
his
sword
.
<EOS>
everywhere
success
have
attend
the
Cavaliers
in
their
onslaught
,
though
the
enemy
treble
them
in
number
,
and
be
protect
by
fort
and
rampart
.
<EOS>
the
assailant
be
support
by
the
musketeer
and
cannonier
on
the
wall
and
in
the
tower
of
the
castle
;
but
the
latter
have
to
fire
carefully
for
fear
of
injure
their
friend
.
<EOS>
but
the
Cavaliers
be
so
impetuous
that
they
scarcely
seem
to
need
aid
.
<EOS>
animate
by
a
burn
desire
to
chastise
the
insolence
of
the
rebel
,
and
inflict
a
severe
blow
upon
them
,
they
succeed
almost
beyond
expectation
.
<EOS>
many
daring
deed
be
do
that
give
renown
to
those
who
perform
them
.
<EOS>
a
battery
be
take
single
-
hand
by
Captain
Radcliffe
,
who
slay
seven
man
with
his
own
hand
,
and
a
feat
almost
equally
remarkable
be
achieve
by
Lieutenant
Pesketh
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
a
panic
seize
the
besieger
,
who
have
lose
altogether
more
than
fifty
man
.
<EOS>
no
prisoner
be
make
by
the
Royalists
,
because
they
have
find
that
the
parliamentarian
commander
be
unwilling
to
exchange
them
.
<EOS>
thus
the
whole
line
of
fortification
be
abandon
,
all
the
cannon
be
spike
,
and
as
far
as
possible
the
work
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
an
immense
number
of
musket
be
take
.
<EOS>
for
some
moment
the
signal
give
by
Captain
Foxe
be
unheeded
,
the
victor
be
unwilling
to
retire
,
but
at
length
Captain
Standish
prepare
to
re
-
enter
the
castle
,
and
the
other
leader
follow
his
example
.
<EOS>
though
scatter
about
,
the
man
be
speedily
get
together
,
and
the
retreat
be
execute
in
very
good
order
,
<EOS>
albeit
a
troop
of
horse
,
under
the
command
of
Colonel
Rigby
,
be
close
at
hand
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
but
no
attempt
at
interruption
be
offer
,
and
Rigby
,
though
highly
incensed
,
do
not
deem
it
prudent
to
expose
himself
to
the
fire
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
thus
Standish
be
allow
to
cross
the
drawbridge
,
and
pass
through
the
gate
unmoleste
,

good

"
that
I

""we

the
rage
of

that
although
we

CHAPTER
XIXHow
a
Council
of
War
be
hold
by
the
Besiegers
;
and
how
a
day
of
fast
and
Prayer
be
appoint
by
FairfaxNOT
satisfied
with
the
damage
do
by
the
attack
just
describe
,
the
engineer
in
the
tower
keep
up
a
constant
fire
upon
the
enemy
,
and
strove
to
prevent
them
from
repair
the
fortification
,
and
unspike
the
cannon
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
the
besieger
be
harass
throughout
the
entire
day
,
and
at
night
they
be
alarm
by
a
fresh
sortie
conduct
by
Captain
Chisenhale
and
Captain
Ogle
.
<EOS>
though
this
sortie
be
on
a
small
scale
,
and
intend
merely
as
an
alarm
,
it
be
very
well
carry
out
,
and
produce
a
singular
result
.
<EOS>
reinforcement
have
just
be
send
to
the
trench
by
Rigby
,
and
the
new-
comer
,
perplex
by
the
shout
and
cry
which
be
hear
on
all
side
,
fire
upon
their
friend
,
whom
they
mistake
for
foe
,
and
kill
several
of
them
.
<EOS>
as
in
the
morning
,
the
Royalists
escape
without
the
loss
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
these
repeat
disaster
produce
the
natural
effect
.
<EOS>
the
besieger
lose
spirit
,
and
fight
badly
,
and
it
be
evident
they
would
go
on
still
bad
,
if
something
be
not
do
to
rouse
them
.
<EOS>
a
council
of
war
be
therefore
hold
in
the
camp
,
at
which
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
and
the
three
commander
be
present
.
<EOS>
Rigby
,
whose
rage
have
not
yet
subside
,
and
who
consider
himself
aggrieve
by
the
want
of
attention
pay
him
by
the
general
,
be
very
anxious
that
the
mansion
should
be
assault
,
but
Fairfax
would
not
listen
to
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
"I
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
place
be
much
strong
than
we
think
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
that
an
assault
would
be
very
hazardous
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
persist
in
my
plan
of
reduce
it
by
siege
.
<EOS>
this
be
slow
but
sure
,
whereas
if
we
should
be
repulse
in
an
assault
,
the
whole
county
will
ring
with
the
news
,
hundred
of
malignant
,
who
now
dare
not
show
their
head
,
will
come
here
,
and
immense
service
will
consequently
be
do
to
the
royal
cause
.
<EOS>
""should
the
attack
prove
unsuccessful
<EOS>
,
I
grant
that
such
would
be
the
case
,
"
reply
Rigby
;
"
and
I
know
Rosworm
be
averse
to
an
assault
,
but
I
do
not
think
there
be
any
risk
,
and
this
slow
siege
dishearten
our
man
.
<EOS>
these
last
success
of
the
enemy
have
greatly
dishearten
them
.
<EOS>
""Hitherto
<EOS>
,
we
have
be
very
unlucky
,
it
must
be
own
,
and
have
succeed
in
none
of
our
design
,
"
observe
Colonel
Assheton
.
<EOS>
"
Our
miner
have
not
yet
be
able
to
get
under
the
moat
,
and
the
scheme
to
drain
the
spring
on
the
south-
east
of
the
castle
that
supply
the
deep
well
inside
have
totally
fail
.
<EOS>
""We
must
employ
another
plan
,
and
drain
the
well
itself
,
"
say
Colonel
Moore
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
can
be
accomplish
.
<EOS>
""no
<EOS>
doubt
,
"
say
Fairfax
;
"
and
although
we
have
meet
with
many
more
obstruction
in
our
work
than
may
have
be
expect
,
we
have
make
good
progress
.
<EOS>
We
have
cut
off
all
supply
from
without
.
<EOS>
no
fresh
provision
have
be
obtain
by
the
garrison
,
and
as
their
store
will
soon
run
short
,
they
must
submit
or
starve
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
prisoner
last
exchange
declare
they
have
plenty
of
provision
,
and
can
hold
out
for
a
couple
of
month
longer
,
"
remark
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"It
be
the
countess
's
policy
to
make
it
appear
so
,
"
observe
Fairfax
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
possible
the
garrison
can
be
so
well
store
.
<EOS>
""A
contrary
opinion
prevail
,
"
remark
rigby
.
<EOS>
"

the

Our

will
fight
all

"Both
<EOS>
Colonel
Assheton

concur
in

a

<EOS>
all

all
earnestly
beseech
Heaven

their
endeavour
to
drive
her

her
stronghold
,
denounce
her
as
a
Papist

an
idolatress

<EOS>
one
of
the
most
infuriate
amongst
them
take
for
his
text
the
word
of
the
Prophet
:
<EOS>
"
put
yourself

all

"The
<EOS>
discourse

this
zealot
produce
the
desire

upon
his
hearer
,

they
resolve
to
carry
out
his
injunction

<EOS>
but
the
soldier
in

trench
be
not
allow
to
pass
the
day
in
quiet

<EOS>
already
they
have
be
disturb
in
their
devotion
by
an
occasional
cannon
shot
fall
among
them

and
at
last
they
be
rouse

by
shout

a
discharge

musketry
that
announce
that
the
restless

she
have
not
quit

at
a
somewhat
later
hour
than

to
the
unfavourable
state
of
the
weather

<EOS>

of

in
the
upper
part
of

and

<EOS>

precisely
the

except
that
it

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
on

Her

be
finish
before

,
and
she
be

at
a
table
make
some
addition
to
a
journal
,
which
she
keep
in
the
hope
that
her
lord
may
one
day
peruse
it
.
<EOS>
the
last
record
be
very
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
all
have
go
well
.
<EOS>
though
the
besieger
have
complete
their
trench
and
mount
their
battery
they
could
not
hold
them
.
<EOS>
Their
gun
have
be
silence
,
their
fort
partially
destroy
,
and
if
they
begin
the
work
again
,
she
feel
sure
that
with
Heaven
's
aid
the
like
result
would
follow
.
<EOS>
therefore
she
be
of
good
heart
.
<EOS>
as
this
journal
be
intend
for
no
other
eye
than
her
lord
's
,
she
put
down
within
it
her
in
-
most
thought
,
and
these
word
now
flow
from
her
<EOS>
pen:"Oh

<EOS>
"when
<EOS>
the
brave
lady
have
finish
this
sentence
,
she
close
the
little
volume
,
and
her
breast
find
relief
in
a
deep
sigh

<EOS>
at
that
moment
her
countenance

a
different

<EOS>
the
haughty

have
disappear

so
long

alone

when
Gertrude

Captain

we

great
consternation
.
<EOS>
no
further
experiment
be
make
that
day
,
because
the
engineer
in
the
fort
be
afraid
to
work
,
owe
to
the
incessant
fire
keep
up
from
the
rampart
;
but
enough
have
be
do
to
prove
the
tremendous
power
of
the
mortar
,
and
all
those
who
gaze
at
the
stone
think
what
destruction
would
have
be
cause
have
it
fall
on
the
top
of
a
tower
or
on
the
roof
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
on
examine
the
magazine
,
Major
Farrington
make
the
unpleasant
discovery
that
the
powder
be
begin
to
run
short
.
<EOS>
the
constant
firing
from
the
rampart
and
tower
that
have
take
place
during
the
last
week
have
well
-
nigh
exhaust
the
stock
,
and
although
a
considerable
supply
have
be
obtain
from
the
trench
of
the
enemy
during
the
sally
,
very
little
be
leave
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
,
the
countess
become
uneasy
when
she
receive
this
alarm
intelligence
,
and
she
give
peremptory
order
that
no
more
powder
should
be
waste
.
<EOS>
not
a
needless
shot
must
be
fire
.
<EOS>
standish
and
the
officer
do
not
share
her
ladyship
's
uneasiness
,
because
they
feel
certain
the
trench
would
yield
a
fresh
supply
,
and
the
man
be
not
altogether
pleased
by
the
restraint
put
upon
them
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
do
not
dare
to
disobey
order
,
and
for
the
present
the
firing
almost
wholly
cease
.
<EOS>
as
if
to
test
their
patience
,
the
enemy
be
more
active
than
usual
on
that
day
,
and
again
bring
all
their
ordnance
to
bear
upon
the
wall
.
<EOS>
six
of
the
cannon
be
load
with
chain
-
shot
and
bar
of
iron
,
but
happily
do
little
mischief
.
<EOS>
They
then
try
their
musket
for
more
than
half
an
hour
together
,
but
with
no
well
success
.
<EOS>
not
a
single
man
on
the
wall
be
hit
,
nor
could
they
provoke
a
reply
.
<EOS>
later
on
,
they
make
another
experiment
with
the
great
mortar
,
and
this
time
a
grenado
be
throw
at
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
fall
in
a
small
court
at
the
back
of
the
chapel
where
it
explode
,
and
with
such
violence
that
it
shake
down
the
wall
near
it
.
<EOS>
again
no
one
be
injure
,
but
infinite
alarm
be
cause
by
the
concussion
.
<EOS>
the
engineer
fear
that
some
new
fireball
would
next
be
try
,
and
man
provide
with
wet
hide
stand
ready
to
extinguish
these
combustible
if
they
fall
near
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
luckily
the
service
of
these
assistant
be
not
require
.
<EOS>
only
a
second
stone
shot
be
launch
against
the
stronghold
,
and
do
no
harm
.
<EOS>
but
the
mortar
have
now
become
a
terrible
engine
,
and
frighten
the
brave
man
,
who
have
hitherto
deride
all
the
attempt
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
the
mansion
be
build
of
oak
,
and
though
shoot
proof
,
it
may
be
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
this
seem
now
to
be
the
aim
of
the
enemy
,
and
the
possibility
of
such
an
occurrence
fill
the
whole
garrison
with
alarm
.
<EOS>
the
staunch
musketeer
turn
pale
when
speak
of
shell
and
grenadoe
,
and
many
of
them
ask
permission
to
quit
their
lodging
in
the
upper
part
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
to
shame
them
from
their
fear
the
officer
remove
to
these
room
,
but
nothing
could
overcome
the
dread
cause
by
the
mortar
,
and
when
next
day
another
grenado
fall
in
the
midst
of
the
musketeer
it
scatter
them
like
so
many
sheep
.
<EOS>
familiarity
,
however
,
with
the
danger
give
them
courage
,
and
when
they
find
that
grenadoe
be
not
so
dangerous
as
they
imagine
—
no
one
as
yet
have
be
hurt
—
they
begin
to
laugh
at
them
—
especially
when
a
couple
that
be
badly
aim
,
fly
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
just
at
this
time
an
incident
occur
which
,
although
it
do
not
for
a
moment
shake
the
fortitude
of
the
countess
,
cause
her
great
annoyance
.
<EOS>
despite
all
the
firing
and
the
danger
to
which
she
be
expose
,
she
have
mount
daily
—
sometimes
more
than
once
—
to
the
summit
of
the
Eagle
Tower
.
<EOS>
one
day
she
be
at
her
post
,
and
surround
by
her
usual
attendant
,
when
Major
Farrington
show
her
that
the
engineer
in
a
battery
beneath
be
point
a
culverin
against
the
tower
on
which
she
stand
.
<EOS>
the
countess
look
on
undismayed
,
and
smile
as
the
shot
fly
harmlessly
past
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
a
demi
-
cannon
be
fire
from
an
adjacent
battery
,
its
mark
be
evidently
the
same
as
the
culverin
.
<EOS>
shoot
after
shot
from
both
piece
of
ordnance
follow
at
short
interval
,
but
the
tower
remain
untouched
.
<EOS>
"I
would
counsel
your
ladyship
to
descend
,
"
say
Major
Farrington
,
who
have
watch
this
display
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
those
cannonier
have
evidently
get
order
to
demolish
this
tower
,
and
they
will
not
desist
from
the
attempt
,
unless
we
stop
them
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
direct
our
engineer
to
fire
upon
them
?
<EOS>
They
will
not
do
so
without
order
.
<EOS>
""have
<EOS>
we
sufficient
powder
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
the
countess
,
in
a
low
voice
.
"enough
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
not
more
.
<EOS>
""then
let
the
enemy
fire
on
,
"
say
the
brave
lady
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
reserve
our
scanty
stock
for
a
more
important
occasion
.
<EOS>
""I
be
certain
Rigby
be
in
the
near
battery
with
the
culverin
,
"
say
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
him
now
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
you
so
?
"
say
the
countess
,
almost
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
by
Heaven
,
he
shall
not
insult
me
thus
.
<EOS>
give
instant
order
to
return
the
fire
.
<EOS>
at
any
hazard
we
will
silence
them
.
<EOS>
""I
be
right
glad
your
ladyship
have
so
resolve
,
"
say
Major
Farrington
,
as
he
depart
on
the
errand
.
<EOS>
not
till
she
have
enjoy
the
gratification
of
see
the
demi
-
cannon
dismount
by
her
own
engineer
<EOS>
do
the
countess
quit
her
post
.
<EOS>
She
then
descend
to
the
court
,
feel
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
answer
she
have
give
to
Rigby
's
insolent
challenge
.
<EOS>
but
her
triumph
be
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
while
she
be
talk
to
Major
Farrington
,
who
have
come
to
meet
her
,
a
shot
from
the
culverin

an
angle
in
the
Eagle
Tower
,
make
a
large
breach
in
the
wall
,
and
demolish
part
of
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
"Your

just

down
in

"
observe
Major
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
that
shall

<EOS>
"And

CHAPTER

<EOS>
night
it

very
dark
and
well
adapt
for
a
sortie
,
but
as
the
officer
be
not
allow
to
sally
forth
in
consequence
of
the
scarcity
of
powder
,
they
resort
to
a
device
to
annoy
the
enemy
,
that
prove
perfectly
successful
.
<EOS>
ball
of
clay
,
furnish
with
a
light
match
,
such
as
be
use
by
the
musketeer
,
be
fling
from
the
rampart
towards
the
enemy
's
work
,
and
quickly
attract
the
attention
of
the
sentry
,
who
think
an
assail
party
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
the
alarm
be
instantly
give
.
<EOS>
drum
be
beat
,
and
shortly
afterwards
,
musket
and
perier
be
fire
in
the
direction
of
the
light
.
<EOS>
for
a
short
time
this
go
on
,
to
the
great
delight
of
the
spectator
on
the
rampart
,
when
the
besieger
find
the
light
continue
motionless
,
suddenly
cease
firing
.
<EOS>
shout
of
laughter
from
the
rampart
explain
the
trick
play
upon
them
.
<EOS>
next
morning
the
besieger
begin
to
shout
loudly
in
their
turn
,
be
evidently
desirous
of
attract
the
attention
of
Major
Farrington
and
the
officer
of
the
garrison
to
a
fresh
stock
of
grenadoe
and
bomb
that
have
just
arrive
at
the
work
.
<EOS>
these
they
display
ostentatiously
,
and
point
significantly
to
the
fort
in
which
the
mortar
be
place
,
vociferate
at
the
top
of
their
voices:"we
will
soon
send
you
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
"burne
<EOS>
with
rage
,
the
man
would
fain
have
respond
to
these
insult
with
their
gun
,
but
be
forbid
to
fire
.
<EOS>
but
the
sight
of
the
grenadoe
make
Major
Farrington
feel
very
anxious
,
and
he
have
a
long
conference
with
the
countess
,
during
which
he
represent
to
her
,
without
any
attempt
at
disguise
,
the
extreme
danger
to
be
apprehend
from
a
shower
of
these
terrible
projectile
.
<EOS>
two
other
person
only
be
present
at
the
conference
.
<EOS>
these
be
Archdeacon
Rutter
and
Captain
Standish
,
but
though
deeply
interested
,
they
offer
no
opinion
.
<EOS>
"The
time
have
arrive
,
"
say
the
countess
,
after
some
minute
'
reflection
,
"
when
a
heavy
blow
must
be
strike
against
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
at
any
risk
—
at
any
cost
—
we
must
deprive
him
of
that
mortar
.
<EOS>
""unquestionably
,
that
would
be
the
heavy
blow
that
could
be
deal
him
,
"
rejoin
Farrington
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
if
it
can
be
accomplish
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
such
doubt
,
"
say
the
countess
,
in
a
determined
tone
.
<EOS>
"
but
be
the
result
what
it
may

the
attempt
shall
be
make
,
and
without

Captain
Standish

<EOS>
she
add
,
to
him

<EOS>
be
there
not

<EOS>
"

the
more
hazardous

<EOS>
""I
speak
not

Major
Farrington
;
"
but
I
fear
that
the

devoted

""It

"It

I
repeat
there
must
be
no

plan
must
be

the
desperate
resistance
of
the

.
<EOS>
the
noise
of
this
conflict
rouse
all
the
besieger
from
their
slumber
,
but
the
assailant
have
successfully
accomplish
their
first
object
,
and
secure
themselves
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
they
have
obtain
a
fresh
supply
of
powder

<EOS>
Leaving

the

who
fire
upon
their
assailant
as
they
come

do
them
little
injury

<EOS>
from
the
position
of
this
fort
,
which
have
be
describe
as
on
a
rise
ground
,
it
be
soon
find
by
the
Royalists
that
their
musket
be
useless
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
pick
up
some
of
the
large
stone
lie
about
,
and
hurl
them
over
the
rampart
.
<EOS>
the
clatter
of
these
missile

be
prodigious

<EOS>
many
of

other

<EOS>
take
advantage
of
their
confusion
,
the
assailant
quickly
clear
the
ditch
surround
the
fort
,
and
scale
the
rampart
,
kill
several
of
the
enemy
,
and
put
the
rest
to
flight
.
<EOS>
have
thus
secure
their
prize
,
they
give
a
loud
shout
,
which
be
return
by
their
comrade
in
the
battery
they
have
first
take
,
and
again
by
the
musketeer
on
the
postern
-
tower
and
on
the
wall
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
the
time
have
now
come
when
the
assistance

the
serving

man
,
who
have
attend
them
during

<EOS>
these
stout

,
who
,
it
have
be

,
be
provide
with
the
necessary
implement
,
soon
contrive
to
level
the
trench
,
while
the
musketeer
pull
down
a
portion
of
the
rampart
.
<EOS>
a
passage
be
thus
make
for
the
mortar
,
it
be
drag
by
a
score
of
strong
hand
from
the
sconce
,
then
down
the
side
of
the
mound
,
and
across
the
now
level
trench
.
<EOS>
thus
much
be
accomplish
without
opposition
.
<EOS>
but
the
enemy
be
resolve
to
prevent
the
removal
of
the
great
engine
.
<EOS>
a
large
party
of
musketeer
rush
forward
with
shout
and
attack
the
successful
Royalists
,
who
return
their
fire
,
and
a
sharp
conflict

<EOS>
however

it
do
not

which
be
within
musket

shot
,
Standish
and
Chisenhale
be
soon
able
to
disperse
the
foe
,
and
move
on
as
fast
as
they
could
with
their
prize
towards
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
two
other
attempt
be
make
to
check
their
retreat
,
but
be
equally
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
the
victor
be
now
join
by
Bretergh
and
Walthew
with
the
party
from
the
battery
first
take
,
and
their
force
be
sufficient
to
repel
any
attack
.
<EOS>
so
they
move
on
tranquilly
under
the
gun
of
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
They
have
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
sortie
.
<EOS>
not
only
have
they
secure
the
grand
prize
for
which
they
have
come
forth
,
but
what
be
nearly
as
important
,
they
have
obtain
a
large
supply
of
powder
;
so
that
they
be
now
quite
easy
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
in
addition
to
all
these
thing
,
snatch
from
the
very
tooth
of
the
foe
,
they
bring
back
with
them
a
great
number

and
five

the
latter
capture

<EOS>
as
the
victor
enter
the
gate
they
be
welcome
by
the
guard
with
shout
and
other
demonstration
of
delight
,
but
this
be
nothing
compare
to
the
frantic
enthusiasm
manifest
by
the
soldier
collect
in
the
court

yard
at
the
sight
of
the
mortar

<EOS>
They
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
terrible
engine
that
have
cause
them
so
much
alarm
be
stand
before
them
.
<EOS>
They
strike
it
with
their
gun
,
they
spurn
it
,
they
leap
upon
it
,
they
dance
round
it
,
and
commit
a
hundred
extravagance
.
<EOS>
"Ah

one
of

CHAPTER
XXIVHow
Colonel
Holland
promise
to
bring
Reinforcements
from
manchestergreat
<EOS>
be
the
mortification
of
Rigby
,
when
he
find
that
the
engine
,
with
which
he
have
hope
to
accomplish
the
destruction
of
Lathom
House
,
have
be
take
from
him
;
and
additional
sharpness
be
add
to
the
stroke
by
the
fact
that
Colonel
Holland
have
be
invite
to
witness
his
triumph
,
and
have
use
great
despatch
to
arrive
in
time
.
<EOS>
unable
to
invent
any
excuse
,
Rigby
be
oblige
to
confess
the
truth
—
neither
could
he
conceal
the
fact
that
such
great
discontent
prevail
among
his
soldier
,
that
a
mutiny
be
threaten
.
<EOS>
More
than
two
hundred
have
run
away
from
the
trench
that
morning
,
and
these
add
to
the
large
number
kill
in
the
attack
of
the
Royalists
,
or
malignant
,
as
he
term
them
,
make
a
very
serious
loss
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
see
how
the
reduction
of
the
garrison
could
now
be
accomplish
,
except
by
starvation
or
want
of
water
.
<EOS>
He
believe
that
their
stock
of
provision
be
get
low
,
and
hope
to
drain
their
well
,
but
so
many
failure
in
his
plan
have
occur
that
he
do
not
feel
very
sanguine
.
<EOS>
the
siege
may
drag
on
till
the
countess
obtain
<EOS>
assistance
from
the
king
,
or
from
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
he
understand
have
quit
the
Isle
of
Man
,
and
be
now
in
Chester
.
<EOS>
after
thus
explain
his
position
,
he
request
Colonel
Holland
to
send
him
an
immediate
reinforcement
from
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"I
want
five
hundred
man
without
delay
to
replace
those
I
have
lose
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
longer
equal
to
the
task
give
me
.
<EOS>
the
sortie
of
the
enemy
be
so
frequent
,
that
the
soldier
be
oblige
to
guard
the
trench
for
two
night
run
—
sometimes
more
.
<EOS>
by
this
last
attack
I
have
lose
more
than
two
hundred
of
my
good
man
,
and
at
least
twenty
engineer
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
another
mortar
,
in
order
that
I
may
make
a
fresh
attempt
to
burn
down
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
should
likewise
feel
well
pleased
if
you
would
send
Colonel
Rosworm
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
may
render
me
great
assistance
.
<EOS>
""I
be
unable
to
comply
with
the
latter
request
,
"
reply
Colonel
Holland
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
speak
to
rosworm
on
the
subject
,
but
he
absolutely
refuse
to
lend
any
further
aid
against
the
Countess
of
Derby
,
and
do
not
seek
to
disguise
his
hope
that
she
may
be
able
to
hold
out
.
<EOS>
I
will
bring
you
the
five
hundred
man
you
require
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
,
though
their
withdrawal
from
the
Manchester
garrison
will
greatly
reduce
our
strength
—
but
I
can
not
promise
you
another
mortar
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
time
this
long
siege
should
be
bring
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
the
heroic
defence
make
by
the
countess
—
for
heroic
it
be
—
be
the
talk
of
the
whole
county
,
and
be
damage
our
cause
while
it
raise
the
hope
of
the
malignant
.
<EOS>
We
must
compel
her
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
""i
see
not
how
that
can
be
accomplish
,
"
rejoin
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
try

many
of

another
such
month

you
shall
have
the

""I
be
not

of
it

Rigby

I
would
as
soon
enter
a
lion

I
should
expect

everything

who

<EOS>
be
his

so
disposed

a
blow
on
the

the
chamber
.
<EOS>
with
him
be
an
elderly
personage
,
who
from
his
aspect
may
have
be
take
for
a
Puritan
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
sharp
and
intelligent
,
and
his
eye
keen
.
<EOS>
He
be
envelop
in
a

You

where
he

a
short
halt
,
towards
Has

and
Sandbach

<EOS>
Report
add
that
the
inhabitant
of
Nantwich
,
most
of
whom
be
friendly
to
the
Parliament
,
have
be
throw
into
the
great
consternation
,
as
they
expect
the
town
would
be
assault
by
the
prince
,
but
he
appear
to
have
other
design
.
<EOS>
the
royalist
troop
,
however
,
be
plunder
the
whole
district
,
seize
all
the
horse
they
could
find
,
and
force
great
number
of
the
peasantry
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
on
receive
this
intelligence
,
Lord
Derby
at
once
alter
his
plan
,
and
instead
of
proceed
to
Chester
,
strike
across
the
country
towards
Knutsford
,
rest
for
the
night
at
Nether
Peover
.
<EOS>
next
morning
,
he
ascertain
that
the
prince
be
advance
with
his
whole
force
to
Knutsford
,
and
ride
on
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
abundant
evidence
be
afford
that
a
large
army
be
on
the
march
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
farmhouse
be
desert
,
and
the
country
folk
be
fly
in
all
direction
,
fearful
of
be
compel
to
serve
as
recruit
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
advanced
guard
of
the
Royal
army
come
in
sight
.
<EOS>
It
consist
of
five
hundred
lancer
,
and
a
like
number
of
cuirassier
,
all
well
mounted
and
completely
armed
—
the
foremost
be
furnish
with
steel
cap
,
gorget
,
and
breast
-
plate
,
and
the
latter
with
polished
cuirass
,
that
glitter
in
the
sun
.
<EOS>
then
follow
several
regiment
of
harquebussier
and
dragoon
.
<EOS>
these
do
not
make
quite
such
a
brilliant
show
as
the
troop
that
have
go
before
them
,
but
be
quite
as
serviceable
in
the
field
—
if
not
more
so
.
<EOS>
the
artillery
consist
of
twenty
large
cannon
,
each
draw
by
four
strong
horse
.
<EOS>
these
piece
of
ordnance
have
just
be
use
at
Newark
.
<EOS>
the
infantry
,
which
we
have
say
be
not
so
numerous
as
the
horse
,
comprise
six
regiment
,
each
five
hundred
strong
,
and
besides
there
be
a
thousand
pikeman
and
billman
.
<EOS>
view
from
the
brow
of
a
hill
,
as
Lord
Derby
first
beheld
it
,
with
its
flag
fly
,
and
its
numerous
richly
accoutre
officer
ride
with
their
man
,
this
large
army
present
a
splendid
sight
,
well
calculated
to
fill
the
earl
with
martial
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
equal
ardour
be
kindle
in
Standish
's
breast
,
and
he
long
to
join
the
force
,
which
appear
to
him
resistless
.
<EOS>
have
gaze
at
the
spectacle
for
a
few
minute
and
listen
to
the
stirring
strain
that
add
so
materially
to
its
effect
,
the
earl
ride
down
the
hill
,
and
gallop
past
the
lancer
and
cuirassier
till
he
meet
the
prince
,
with
whom
be
several
officer
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
be
fine
-
look
man
,
but
not
to
compare
with
their
valiant
leader
.
<EOS>
as
usual
Prince
Rupert
be
magnificently
accoutre
,
and
bestrode
a
powerful
charger
.
<EOS>
elate
by
his
recent
success
,
confident
in
his
ability
to
subdue
the
foe
on
any
future
engagement
,
and
burn
for
revenge
,
he
look
full
of
spirit
,
though
even
when
thus
excited
,
his
countenance
have
a
stern
expression
,
and
when
he
speak
his
eye
seem
occasionally
to
flash
fire
.
<EOS>
the
prince
be
much
surprised
to
behold
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
as
he
have
not
expect
to
meet
him
on
the
march
,
but
he
greet
him
most
cordially
.
<EOS>
no
halt
be
make
.
<EOS>
the
officer
who
be
with
the
prince
when
Lord
Derby
come
up
fall
back
,
and
leave
them
together
.
<EOS>
They
then
ride
side
by
side
,
and
be
soon
engage
in
earnest
discourse
,
which
be
conduct
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
Rupert
's
expression
become
fiercer
,
and
his
eye
blaze
as
he
listen
to
what
the
earl
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
representation
make
to
him
,
it
seem
that
the
prince
have
not
exactly
comprehend
the
condition
of
the
countess
at
Lathom
House
,
nor
be
he
aware
of
the
indignity
to
which
she
have
be
subject
.
<EOS>
but
when
Lord
Derby
explain
what
have
really
occur
during
the
siege
,
he
be
exceedingly
wroth
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
idea
my
cousin
,
the
countess
,
have
be
so
much
distressed
by
these
insolent
rebel
,

""Why

should
it

"No

that

she

<EOS>
"
be
any
disaster
to
occur
,
my
lord
would
blame
me
.
<EOS>
"Standish
<EOS>
say
no
more
,
though
he
feel
mortify
by
her
ladyship
's
refusal

<EOS>
a
strong
sense
of
disappointment
pervade
both
officer
and
man
that
they
be
not
to
be
allow
a
last
chance
of
punish
the
detest
foe
,
but
they
repress
the
feeling
as
well
as
they
could
,
and
only
display
it
by
pick
off
a
man
now
and
then
on
the
battery
.
<EOS>
a
strange
sort
of
quietude
prevail
amongst
the
enemy
,
which
could
only
be
explain
by
the
supposition
that
they
be
prepare
either
for
a
general
assault
or
a
speedy
retreat
.
<EOS>
that
news
have
reach
them
of
the
advance
of
Prince
Rupert
and
the
earl
be
apparent
,
but
how
they
mean
to
act
under
the
circumstance
could
not
be
so
readily
conjecture
.
<EOS>
the
great
care
be
take
by
Rigby
to
cut
off
all
communication
between
the
garrison
and
their
friend
,
and
he
succeed
so
well
that
no
intelligence
,
later
than
that
bring
by
Standish
,
have
as
yet
reach
the
countess
.
<EOS>
She
know
not
whether
Rupert
and
the
earl
have
pass
Stockport
Bridge
,
or
whether
they
have
be
compel
by
the
successful
resistance
of
the
enemy
to
cross
the
Mersey
at
Warrington
.
<EOS>
in
the
latter
case
they
would
have
to
storm
the
town
,
and
this
would
occasion
considerable
delay
.
<EOS>
Linacre
and
another
scout
have
be
send
out
to
obtain
information
,
but
neither
have
return
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
though
the
garrison
know
it
not
,
the
utmost
anxiety
prevail
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
,
and
constant
council
be
hold
by
Rigby
and
Colonel
Assheton
,
Colonel
Holland
have
return
to
Manchester
on
the
first
tiding
of
the
prince
's
approach
,
as
it
be
not
improbable
that
town
may
be
assault
by
the
prince
.
<EOS>
all
the
available
force
that
could
be
get
together
by
the
Parliamentary
commander
be
send
to
stock
-
port
to
defend
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
for
them
,
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
,
the
only
general
who
could
have
adequately
direct
their
effort
at
this
critical
juncture
,
or
encounter
the
resistless
Rupert
with
a
chance
of
success
,
be
in
Yorkshire
,
and
could
not
arrive
in
time
.
<EOS>
the
Parliamentary
force
,
thus
hastily
collect
,
amount
to
four
thousand
man
—
five
hundred
of
whom
be
contribute
by
Rigby
from
his
beleaguer
force
at
Lathom
.
<EOS>
the
commander
of
this
force
,
which
consist
chiefly
of
infantry
,
be
Colonels
Duckenfield
and
Mainwaring
,
two
officer
of
courage
and
experience
.
<EOS>
They
have
with
them
a
dozen
large
cannon
.
<EOS>
at
Stockport
,
the
Mersey
,
which
here
divide
Cheshire
and
Lancashire
,
run
through
a
deep
ravine
with
high
cliff
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
the
river
be
cross
by
a
narrow
stone
bridge
,
which
from
its
position
could
be
easily
defend
.
<EOS>
post
on
the
Lancashire
side
of
the
river
,
the
Parliamentary
leader
have
place
six
of
their
cannon
so
as
to
command
the
bridge
,
and
the
rest
on
the
height
above
.
<EOS>
the
cliff
be
cover
with
musketeer
who
could
fire
upon
the
enemy
as
from
the
rampart
of
a
castle
,
while
a
large
force
,
draw
up
on
both
side
of
the
bridge
,
be
ready
to
dispute
the
passage
.
<EOS>
when
Prince
Rupert
look
down
upon
this
formidable
pass
,
and
see
how
well
it
be
defend
,
he
remark
to
the
Earl
of
Derby
,
who
be
with
him:"The
rebel
have
do
their
good
to
keep
us
out
of
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
It
will
take
some
time
and
cost
some
man
to
get
to
the
other
side
of
this
ravine
,
but
we
shall
do
it
in
spite
of
them
.
<EOS>
""will
<EOS>
your
highness
go
first
,
or
shall
I
clear
the
bridge
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the

.
<EOS>
"no

<EOS>
no

"
reply
the
prince
.
"
<EOS>
follow
with
the
cuirassier
.
<EOS>
"have
<EOS>
give
some
order
,
the
valiant
prince
,
who
love
to
confront
danger
,
draw
his
sword
,
place
himself
at
the
head
of
his
lancer
,
and
dash
down
the
precipitous
bank
like
a
torrent
,
sweep
all
before
it
.
<EOS>
utterly
unable
to
withstand
the
furious
onset
,
the
soldier
,
who
guard
the
approach
to
the
bridge
be
either
cut
to
piece
,
or
drive
back
upon
their
comrade
,
so
that
the
bridge
be
crowd
with
<EOS>
soldier
jam
so
closely
together
that
they
could
not
move
hand
or
foot
.
<EOS>
in
this
helpless
condition
they
be
mercilessly
slaughter
by
the
lancer
,
to
escape
whom
number
leap
over
the
parapet
into
the
river
and
be
drown
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
,
Rupert
be
across
the
bridge
,
cut
down
,
or
scatter
the
new
force
that
vainly
attempt
to
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
the
musketeer
on
the
cliff
have
begin
to
fire
,
and
shower
of
bullet
whistle
past
the
prince
,
but
he
seem
to
bear
a
charm
life
,
for
not
a
shot
strike
him
.
<EOS>
the
cannon
near
the
bridge
prove
useless
,
and
be
take
before
the
engineer
could
open
fire
,
while
the
ordnance
on
the
height
,
be
badly
level
,
do
more
harm
to
friend
than
foe
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
Earl
of
Derby
have
join
the
prince
,
and
harquebussier
and
dragoon
be
follow
fast
,
so
that
the
whole
ravine
seem
fill
with
soldier
,
and
resound
with
the
roar
of
cannon
and
the
rattle
of
musketry
.
<EOS>
to
prevent
the
Royalists
from
climb
the
bank
,
Colonel
Duckenfield
have
bar
the
ascent
with
a
thousand
man
,
and
a
terrible
conflict
take
place
,
but
it
end
in
the
complete
rout
of
the
Parliamentarians
,
more
than
half
of
whom
be
slay
.
<EOS>
the
battle
do
not
last
more
than
two
hour
,
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
Rupert
and
Lord
Derby
be
in
Lancashire
,
with
their
whole
force
—
neither
of
them
have
receive
a
wound
,
while
the
enemy
be
fly
in
all
direction
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
the
Royalists
be
slight
as
compare
with
those
of
the
foe
.
<EOS>
quantity
of
arm
be
take
,
and
many
prisoner
make
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
prince
's
entrance
into
Lancashire
have
be
mark
by
an
important
victory
,
tiding
of
which
would
quickly
spread
throughout
the
country
,
rouse
the
well
-
affect
,
and
fill
the
rebel
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
on
hearing
of
this
signal
defeat
,
Rigby
be
fill
with
consternation
.
<EOS>
clearly
,
the
siege
of
Lathom
House
must
be
abandon
,
since
he
could
not
doubt
that
Prince
Rupert
and
the
Earl
of
Derby
would
immediately
come
to
succour
the
countess
,
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
stand
against
them
.
<EOS>
He
know
not
which
way
to
turn
.
<EOS>
if
he
retire
to
Manchester
,
he
should
inevitably
meet
the
foe
.
<EOS>
after
some
consideration
,
he
decide
upon
proceed
to
Bolton
,
which
have
now
become
a
Puritan
town
,
and
where
there
be
a
strong
parliamentary
garrison
.
<EOS>
but
he
determine
not
to
set
out
till
night
,
as
he
wish
to
keep
the
countess
in
suspense
to
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
with
this
object
he
order
a
certain
number
of
man
to
remain
in
the
trench
,
and
occupy
the
battery
till
it
become
dark
.
<EOS>
later
on
in
the
day
,
the
remnant
of
the
troop
he
have
send
to
Stockport
return
,
in
a
very
shatter
condition
,
several
of
them
wound
,
and
most
of
them
without
arm
or
ammunition
.
<EOS>
Captain
Willoughby
and
Captain
Bootle
,
the
only
officer
leave
,
out
of
half
a
dozen
,
give
him
particular
of
the
disastrous
fight
,
and
confirm
his
apprehension
that
the
victorious
Royalist
commander
be
march
to
Lathom
to
wreak
their
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
alternative
,
therefore
,
but
flight
,
and
he
accordingly
hasten
his
preparation
for
departure
.
<EOS>
before
set
out
,
he
send
Captain
Bootle
with
a
small
troop
of
horse
to
Knowsley
,
order
him
to
make
prisoner
of
Don
Fortunio
and
his
daughter
,
and
bring
them
to
Bolton
,
as
he
hope
to
obtain
a
large
ransom
for
them
.
<EOS>
an
hour
before
midnight
,
he
have
assemble
his
whole
force
,
which
notwithstanding
the
loss
he
have
just
sustain
amount
to
nearly
three
thousand
man
.
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
the
order
give
them
,
the
soldier
have
silently
quit
the
trench
and
battery
,
and
nothing
indicate
that
the
musketeer
on
the
battery
be
aware
of
their
departure
.
<EOS>
screen
by
the
darkness
,
Rigby
then
steal
away
,
deeply
mortified
and
humiliate
,
the
Leaguer
that
have
last
nearly
four
month
be
thus
disgracefully
abandon
.
<EOS>
all
possible
expedition
be
use
in
the
nocturnal
march
,
for
the
Parliamentarians
be
fearful
of
pursuit
,
know
that
quarter
would
not
be
give
them
,
if
they
be
overtaken
.
<EOS>
They
may
have
find
refuge
in
Wigan
,
which
be
not
far
off
,
but
Rigby
do
not
dare
to
stay
there
,
as
he
would
not
have
be
secure
from
the
vengeful
Earl
of
Derby
.
<EOS>
so
he
go
on
,
leave
behind
him
at
Eccleston
and
Wrightington
such
of
his
wound
soldier
as
be
unable
to
continue
the
rapid
march
.
<EOS>
on
reach
Lostock
Hall
,
he
halt
for
an
hour
,
and
then
make
his
way
over
the
hill
and
moor
lie
between
him
and
Bolton
,
arrive
there
soon
after
day-
break
.
<EOS>
not
till
he
be
inside
the
mud
wall
that
protect
the
town
,
do
he
feel
secure

<EOS>
as
the
two

cautiously
advance
towards
the

,
they
be
surprised
to
find
that
all
remain
quiet
.
<EOS>
no
sentinel
could
be
discover
,
nor
be
a
single
shot

from
the

<EOS>
beginning
,
at
length
,
to
suspect

from
the

by
Ogle
and
Rawsthorne

and
from
musketeer
on
the
rampart
of
the
mansion

but
no
other

and
it
be
clear
that
the
besieger
have
decamp
,
leave
nothing
behind
them
except
such
ordnance
as
be
too
heavy
to

.
<EOS>

She

<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
not
a
single
person
in
the
garrison
that
do

<EOS>
as
soon
as

,
the
sudden
departure
of

enemy
be
confirm
,
since
it
could
be

that
the

<EOS>
evidently
Rigby

he
should

out
at
the

time
as

mount
a
little
eminence
,
whence
he
obtain
a
complete
view
of
the
town

here
about
half
a

distant

a
careful
survey

there
be
only
two

and
both
be
strongly
guard

<EOS>
from
previous
experience
in
Manchester
,
he
know
that
these

would
effectually
resist

<EOS>
the
wall
therefore
must
be
first
gain

and
this
would
be
no
easy
task

for
they
be
throng
with
musketeer

provide
with
several
large

he
take
a
final
survey
of
the
town

be
oblige
to
confess
that
it
be
likely
to
make
an
obstinate
resistance
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
not
large
,

the
garrison
be
very
strong
,
and
unless
he
be
much
mistaken

be
there
in

nothing
seem

nor
could
he
detect
a

point

on

a
moment
longer

a
simultaneous

hitherto

compact
mass

into
different
company

some
move
to
the
right
,
and
other
to
the
left

but
all
with
great
rapidity

<EOS>
before
each
gate
be
a
squadron
of
horse
eager
to
dash
in
as
soon
as
an
entrance
could

at

Parliamentarians

bravery
he
have
form

contemptible
opinion

<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Derby
be
quite
as
much

at
the
check
they

He

easy
victory

Rupert

the

slowly
and
in

evidently
intend
to
renew
the
attack

<EOS>
no
attempt
be
make
to
cut
off
their
retreat

for
the
Parliamentarians
be
too
prudent
to
quit
their
stronghold

have
they
sally
forth

CHAPTER
iiiwhat
pass
between
Colonel
Rigby
and
RoswormRIGBY
and
his
officer
be
greatly
elate
by
their
successful
defence
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
but
they
scarcely
like
to
acknowledge
how
much
they
owe
to
the
skill
of
the
great
german
engineer
.
<EOS>
Rosworm
have
not
take
an
active
part
of
the
defence
,
but
have
explain
his
plan
to
Rigby
,
by
whom
they
be
carry
out
,
with
the
result
just
describe
.
<EOS>
but
though
Rupert
and
Lord
Derby
have
be
repulse
,
Rosworm
feel
certain
the
assault
would
be
renew
,
and
with
additional
vigour
,
and
he
warn
Rigby
not
to
be
too
confident
,
since
he
have
terrible
foe
to
deal
with
,
who
be
bent
upon
vengeance
,
and
would
not
depart
without
it
.
<EOS>
Rigby
pay
little
heed
to
the
counsel
,
for
he
now
feel
sure
he
could
hold
out
till
assistance
arrive
from
Wigan
,
Blackburn
,
Manchester
,
and
other
place
.
<EOS>
"before
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
,
I
shall
be
reinforce
by
ten
thousand
man
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"But
before
to
-
morrow
,
the
town
may
be
take
,
"
rejoin
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"I
be
not
uneasy
,
"
say
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
the
reception
give
them
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
the
prince
and
Lord
Derby
will
venture
to
make
another
assault
.
<EOS>
but
should
they
do
so
,
we
shall
repulse
them
again
.
<EOS>
""keep
out
the
cavalry
<EOS>
and
you
be
safe
,
"
say
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
but
should
they
once
enter
,
the
town
be
lose
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
fortify
the
place
so
well
that
it
be
impregnable
,
"
say
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"There
be
but
one
weak
spot
,
and
that
the
enemy
will
never
discover
,
"
say
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
where
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Rigby
,
somewhat
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
find
it
out
myself
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
wall
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
round
them
several
time
,
and
could
detect
nothing
wrong
.
<EOS>
""the
<EOS>
wall
be
quite
secure

there
be
a
subterranean
passage
under
the
ditch
that
may
be
use
as
a
sally
-
port
,
"
reply
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
It
lead
to
a
place
call
the
Private
Acres
.
<EOS>
""where
be
the
entrance
to
this
subterranean
passage

ask
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"In

rosworm

well
affected
towards
the
Parliament

<EOS>
""May
be
so
,
"
say
Rigby
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
habitation
ought
to
be
guard
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
order
to
that
effect
,
but
I
must
first
go
to
the
church
,
where
two
worthy
minister
,
Master
John
Harper

Pastor

Bolton
,

Master
John

up
prayer

<EOS>
""I
will
cause
a
guard

there
myself
,
since
you
deem
it
needful
,
"
say
Rosworm
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
desire
to
say
a
word
to
you

the

I
can
not

a
thought
upon
them
now

<EOS>
""do

Rigby

<EOS>
"
I

Bootle
to
provide
them
with
a
lodging
,

he
tell
me
he
have
do
so

as
I

<EOS>
Will
you
take
these

<EOS>
They
can
depart
by

""are

Rigby

"No

CHAPTER
IVHow
Engracia
and
her
Father
escape
by
the
subterranean
PassageIN
the
upper
room
of
a
house
,
scarcely
more
than
fifty
yard
from
the
mud
wall
surround
the
town
,
be
a
beautiful
young
damsel
,
whose
attire
and
feature
show
she
belong
to
a
different
clime
.
<EOS>
She
be
kneel
in
prayer
,
with
a
small
crucifix
clasp
in
her
hand
,
on
which
her
eye
be
fix
.
<EOS>
close
beside
her
be
another
kneeling
figure
—
a
woman
somewhat
old
than
herself
,
and
of
inferior
degree
,
but
not
without
pretension
to
good
look
.
<EOS>
both
be
very
earnest
in
their
supplication
to
the
Blessed
Virgin
to
deliver
them
from
the
hand
into
which
they
have
fall
,
and
when
they
arise
,
they
believe
that
their
prayer
would
be
hear
.
<EOS>
the
dreadful
sound
that
have
recently
assail
their
ear
,
and
fill
them
with
terror
,
have
cease
.
<EOS>
no
more
roaring
of
cannon
—
no
more
rattling
of
musketry
—
no
more
shouting
.
<EOS>
the
attack
be
over
,
and
seem
to
have
end
in
the
defeat
of
their
friend
,
for
as
such
they
regard
the
assailant
.
<EOS>
but
though
greatly
distress
by
this
result
,
they
do
not
believe
that
Heaven
would
abandon
them
;
nor
do
they
think
the
fight
be
entirely
end
.
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
we
find
Engracia
and
her
attendant
Maria

look
towards
the
town

on
approach
the
window

a
great
number

hurry
past

these

<EOS>
in
this
street
be
a
multitude

proffer
them
jug
of
ale

on

as
see
from

the

look
like
a
mass
of
black

white
house
,
in
the
midst
of
which
rise
the
tower
of
the

,
surmount
by
a

very
few

all

<EOS>
Engracia

Your

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIIThe
Siege
of
LiverpoolON
approach
Liverpool
,
Standish
find
that
Prince
Rupert
have
fix
his
camp
round
the
Beacon
,
which
be
situate
on
the
top
of
a
hill
about
a
mile
from
the
town
.
<EOS>
at
the
period
in
question
,
the
great
and
wealthy
town
,
now
the
chief
commercial
port
in
the
kingdom
,
and
the
abode
of
merchant
prince
,
be
then
almost
in
its
infancy
.
<EOS>
but
its
inhabitant
be
remarkably
active
and
enterprising
,
the
position
of
the
port
on
the
Mersey
be
admirably
choose
,
and
even
then
there
be
indication
of
the
future
greatness
and
importance
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
view
from
the
Beacon
Hill
,
Liverpool
do
not
look
very
strongly
fortified
,
and
Prince
Rupert
persuade
himself
he
should
easily
take
it
,
but
he
find
the
task
more
difficult
than
he
expect
.
<EOS>
the
town
possess
a
large
garrison
,
command
by
Colonel
Moore
,
who
have
previously
assist
at
the
Leaguer
of
Lathom
.
<EOS>
the
governor
have
fifteen
hundred
man
with
him
,
of
whom
a
third
be
cavalry
,
and
fresh
supply
derive
from
Manchester
,
be
send
by
water
from
Warrington
.
<EOS>
thus
he
be
enable
to
make
a
formidable
defence
.
<EOS>
like
Bolton
and
all
the
other
town
in
Lancashire
garrison
by
the
Parliament
,
Liverpool
be
surround
by
high
mud
wall
and
a
deep
ditch
.
<EOS>
these
fortification
form
a
semicircle
,
commence
with
the
river
,
inclose
Dale
-
street
,
and
continue
to
some
low
marshy
ground
,
on
the
edge
of
which
battery
be
erect
.
<EOS>
at
the
entrance
to
all
the
street
be
gate
protect
by
cannon
.
<EOS>
on
the
south
there
be
a
strong
castle
contain
the
garrison
,
surround
by
a
deep
fosse
,
by
mean
of
which
store
could
be
bring
in
.
<EOS>
heavy
ordnance
be
place
on
the
wall
command
the
river
,
and
the
port
be
further
protect
by
a
battery
mount
eight
gun
.
<EOS>
the
ship
in
the
harbour
be
likewise
fit
up
to
defend
the
town
on
thè
river
side
.
<EOS>
thus
,
it
will
be
see
that
Liverpool
,
owe
to
its
situation
on
the
Mersey
,
have
advantage
possess
by
no
other
town
in
Lancashire
,
but
it
be
somewhat
expose
on
the
land
side
.
<EOS>
as
an
additional
protection
from
the
shot
of
the
besieger
,
the
wall
be
cover
with
large
bag
of
wool
,
bring
by
the
fugitive
Protestants
from
Ireland
after
the
massacre
.
<EOS>
when
Standish
join
the
prince
,
the
siege
have
already
begin
.
<EOS>
expect
to
take
the
place
by
a
coup
de
main
,
and
not
anticipate
such
vigorous
resistance
as
he
find
from
Governor
Moore
,
Rupert
make
a
furious
assault
on
the
gate
at
the
end
of
Dale
-
street
,
while
another
gate
be
attack
with
equal
fury
by
Lord
Derby
.
<EOS>
both
leader
be
repulse
,
and
with
considerable
loss
,
and
the
prince
be
still
burn
with
rage
at
the
defeat
,
when
Standish
arrive
.
<EOS>
Rupert
rarely
hold
a
council
of
war
,
but
form
his
own
judgment
,
and
act
upon
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
consult
Lord
Derby
as
to
the
prudence
of
a
second
assault
,
and
find
him
exceedingly
averse
to
it
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
recommend
a
regular
siege
with
intrenchment
and
battery
as
at
Lathom
.
<EOS>
"'Sdeath
!
<EOS>
that
will
occupy
a
month
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Rupert
;
"
and
then
we
shall
have
to
storm
the
town
.
<EOS>
""we
<EOS>
shall
not
take
it
otherwise
,
"
say
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
batter
down
the
wall
.
<EOS>
only
by
repeat
attack
shall
we
succeed
.
<EOS>
"evidently
<EOS>
dissatisfied
with
the
advice
,
Rupert
be
unwilling
to
adopt
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
all
impatience
to
wipe
out
the
disgrace
of
the
defeat
.
<EOS>
"this
be
not
the
advice
you
give
me
at
Bolton
,
my
lord
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
then
you
urge
a
second
assault
without
delay
.
<EOS>
no
talk
of
siege
work
.
<EOS>
""Nor
be
they
need
,
your
highness
,
because
we
know
a
gate
would
be
open
to
us

morning
,
before
daybreak
,
in
pursuance
of
the

order
,
the
whole
of
his
force
be
under
arm
,
and
a
general
movement
be
make
towards
the
town
,
but
slowly
and
cautiously
,
so
as
not
to
alarm
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
from
the
Beacon
Hill
,
on
the
brow
of
which
Prince
Rupert
with
the
Earl
of

and
Lord
Caryl
Molineux

the
town
,
with
its
fortification
,
its
castle
,
fort
,
and
harbour
,
with
the
grand
river
flow
past
,
could
be
dimly
descry
.
<EOS>
the
three
personage
be
watch
the
advance
of
the
army
,
preparatory
to
join
the
attack
.
<EOS>
in
the
van
be
a
regiment
of
cuirassier
,
lead
by
Colonel
Standish
,
which
be
march
towards
the
gate
at
the
entrance
of
Dale
-
street
.
<EOS>
at
this
gate
be
two
large
piece
of
ordnance
,
and
besides
the
usual
guard
,
it
have
a
troop
of
horse
to
defend
it
.
<EOS>
face
it
be
a
battery
,
just
erect
by
the
besieger
,
that
mount
three
heavy
gun
.
<EOS>
as
yet
neither
besiege
nor
besieger
have
fire
a
shot
.
<EOS>
but
the
prince
and
his
companion
do
not
remain
long
near
the
Beacon
.
<EOS>
after
look
on
for
a
few
minute
,
they
gallop
down
the
hill
,
and
each
be
at
his
post
before
the
roar
of
the
castle
gun
announce
that
the
advance
of
the
Royalists
be
perceive
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
battery
opposite
Dale
-
street
open
fire
,
and
be
answer
by
the
cannon
of
the
gate
,
a
sort
of
duel
take
place
between
the
engineer
on
either
side
,
that
seem
likely
to
end
in
favour
of
the
besieger
,
two
of
their
shot
have
already
burst
through
the
stout
oak
framework
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
other
gate
be
likewise
attack
by
Lord
Derby
and
Lord
Caryl
Molineux
,
and
defend
with
equal
vigour
.
<EOS>
several
ineffectual
attempt
be
likewise
make
by
the
besieger
to
scale
the
wall
by
mean
of
ladder
place
in
pontoon
.
<EOS>
everywhere
,
indeed
,
the
most
determined
resistance
be
offer
by
the
besiege
,
and
a
ceaseless
fire
be
keep
up
by
them
from
the
wall
,
which
be
shield
,
as
we
have
describe
,
by
bag
of
wool
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
the
large
shot
throw
by
the
castle
gun
,
cause
great
destruction
wherever
they
alight
.
<EOS>
apparently
,
no
advantage
have
be
gain
by
the
Royalists
at
any
point
,
except
at
the
entrance
of
Dale
-
street
,
and
the
captain
of
the
guard
,
fear
the
gate
would
soon
be
batter
down
,
order
the
troop
of
horse
station
there
to
sally
forth
and
dislodge
the
cannon
at
the
battery
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
the
troop
appear
outside
,
than
standish
,
shout
to
his
man
to
follow
,
dash
forward
sword
in
hand
as
if
to
defend
the
battery
.
<EOS>
His
object
,
however
,
be
to
enter
the
town
,
and
he
succeed
in
get
through
the
gate
with
a
dozen
of
his
man
.
<EOS>
the
guard
be
then
cut
down
,
and
the
gate
keep
forcibly
open
till
the
rest
of
the
regiment
have
enter
.
<EOS>
bid
his
man
shout
as
lustily
as
they
could
to
announce
their
success
,
Standish
then
gallop
on
into
the
town
,
in
the
full
belief
that
Lord
Derby
or
Prince
Rupert
would
follow
.
<EOS>
as
the
cuirassier
go
furiously
on
,
a
few
shot
be
fire
at
them
,
but
they
meet
with
no
opposition
,
nor
be
they
immediately
pursue
,
for
the
dragoon
remain
at
the
entrance
of
the
street
till
it
be
effectually
barricade
.
<EOS>
in
effect
,
therefore
,
Standish
and
his
man
be
prisoner
,
though
they
believe
they
have
take
the
town
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
inhabitant
,
who
be
only
just
astir
,
share
in
the
belief
,
and
when
they
beheld
this
splendid
regiment
of
cuirassier
dash
past
,
they
feel
sure
<EOS>
the
sanguinary
Rupert
have
get
in
,
and
that
a
general
massacre
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
standish
and
his
follower
stop
not
either
to
slay
or
plunder
,
but
gallop
furiously
on
to
the
centre
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
a
few
people
be
collect
in
the
marketplace
,
but
they
flee
when
the
Royalist
soldier
appear
.
<EOS>
window
and
door
be
speedily
shut
,
as
Standish
halt
beside
the
cross
to
consider
what
should
be
do
next
.
<EOS>
the

though

that
a
regiment

<EOS>
His

the
castle
to
attack
them
in
front
,
while
he
himself

minute

on

but

,
and
rally
his
man
,
who
be
get
into
disorder
,
endeavour
to
cut
his
way
through
the

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
by
the
help
of
Paul
Moreau
,
the
earl
regain
his
steed
,
and
the
cavalcade
be
once
more
in
motion
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
shake
off
the
impression
make
upon
him
by
the
interview
.
<EOS>
His
head
droop
on
his
breast
,
and
during
the
whole
of
the
day
's
journey
,
he
scarcely
look
around
,
or
speak
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
arrange
that
the
noble
prisoner
should
pass
his
last
night
at
Leigh
—
a
small
town
,
about
six
mile
from
Bolton
.
<EOS>
in
Leigh
Church
have
be
inter
his
friend
and
companion
in
arm
,
the
valiant
Sir
Thomas
Tyldesley
,
who
be
kill
at
Wigan
,
and
the
earl
greatly
desire
to
visit
the
grave
,
but
the
request
be
deny
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
refusal
trouble
him
little
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
indifferent
to
harsh
treatment
,
and
pass
the
evening
in
tranquil
converse
with
Baguley
.
<EOS>
"commend
<EOS>
me
to
Archdeacon
Rutter
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
ask
him
if
he
remember
how
blood
fall
upon
a
book
I
be
read
late
one
night
in
my
closet
at
Knowsley
?
<EOS>
ask
him
what
he
now
think
of
that
strange
occurrence
?
<EOS>
He
will
answer
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
that
his
presentiment
have
be
fully
verify
.
<EOS>
ask
him
further
,
if
he
remember
I
once
tell
him
that
death
in
battle
would
not
trouble
me
,
but
a
blow
on
the
scaffold
would
greatly
startle
me
.
<EOS>
now
I
have
change
my
opinion
,
and
can
as
easily
lay
my
head
on
the
block
as
on
a
pillow
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
supper
,
which
he
declare
should
be
his
last
meal
in
this
world
,
the
earl
throw
himself
upon
a
bed
without
take
off
his
apparel
,
and
while
lie
there
with
his
head
rest
upon
his
right
hand
,
he
compare
himself
to
a
monument
,
adding:"To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
shall
want
a
monument!"At
an
early
hour
he
arise
and
pray
.
<EOS>
before
quit
Leigh
he
be
join
by
his
son
,
Lord
Strange
,
who
attend
him
to
Bolton

<EOS>
a
sad
ride
thither
,
for
he
be
full
of
uneasiness
as
to
the
reception
he
should
experience
from
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
but
his
anxiety
be
speedily
relieve
.
<EOS>
as
they
enter
the
town
,
which
have
a
singularly
dismal
look
,
all
the
person
he
beheld
express
the
deep
sorrow
.
<EOS>
far
from
exult
in
his
death
,
they
utter
doleful
lamentation
,
and
many
call
out:"o
sad
day
!
<EOS>
o
woful
day
!
<EOS>
Shall
the
good
Earl
of
Derby
die
here

<EOS>
many

none

unto
this

for
now
the
ancient
honour
of

suffer
here
at
Bolton

<EOS>
"These

expression
of
sympathy

console
him
