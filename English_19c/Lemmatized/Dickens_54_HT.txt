<EOS>
the
Keynote
 
Coketown
,
to
which
Messrs.
Bounderby
and
Gradgrind
now
walk
,
be
a
triumph
of
fact
;
it
have
no
great
taint
of
fancy
in
it
than
Mrs
Gradgrind
herself
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
strike
the
key
-
note
,
Coketown
,
before
pursue
our
tune
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
town
of
red
brick
,
or
of
brick
that
would
have
be
red
if
the
smoke
and
ashe
have
allow
it
;
but
as
matter
stand
,
it
be
a
town
of
unnatural
red
and
black
like
the
paint
face
of
a
savage
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
town
of
machinery
and
tall
chimney
,
out
of
which
interminable
serpent
of
smoke
trail
themselves
for
ever
and
ever
,
and
never
get
uncoiled
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
a
black
canal
in
it
,
and
a
river
that
run
purple
with
ill
-
smell
dye
,
and
vast
pile
of
building
full
of
window
where
there
be
a
rattling
and
a
tremble
all
day
long
,
and
where
the
piston
of
the
steam
-
engine
work
monotonously
up
and
down
,
like
the
head
of
an
elephant
in
a
state
of
melancholy
madness
.
 
<EOS>
It
contain
several
large
street
all
very
like
one
another
,
and
many
small
street
still
more
like
one
another
,
inhabit
by
people
equally
like
one
another
,
who
all
go
in
and
out
at
the
same
hour
,
with
the
same
sound
upon
the
same
pavement
,
to
do
the
same
work
,
and
to
whom
every
day
be
the
same
as
yesterday
and
to
-
morrow
,
and
every
year
the
counterpart
of
the
last
and
the
next
.
   
<EOS>
these
attribute
of
Coketown
be
in
the
main
inseparable
from
the
work
by
which
it
be
sustain
;
against
them
be
to
be
set
off
,
comfort
of
life
which
find
their
way
all
over
the
world
,
and
elegancie
of
life
which
make
,
we
will
not
ask
how
much
of
the
fine
lady
,
who
could
scarcely
bear
to
hear
the
place
mention
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
its
feature
be
voluntary
,
and
they
be
these
.
   
<EOS>
You
see
nothing
in
Coketown
but
what
be
severely
workful
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
member
of
a
religious
persuasion
build
a
chapel
there
---
as
the
member
of
eighteen
religious
persuasion
have
do
---
they
make
it
a
pious
warehouse
of
red
brick
,
with
sometimes
<EOS>
(
but
this
be
only
in
highly
ornamental
example
)
<EOS>
a
bell
in
a
birdcage
on
the
top
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
solitary
exception
be
the
New
Church
;
a
stuccoed
edifice
with
a
square
steeple
over
the
door
,
terminate
in
four
short
pinnacle
like
florid
wooden
leg
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
public
inscription
in
the
town
be
paint
alike
,
in
severe
character
of
black
and
white
.
 
<EOS>
the
jail
may
have
be
the
infirmary
,
the
infirmary
may
have
be
the
jail
,
the
town
-
hall
may
have
be
either
,
or
both
,
or
anything
else
,
for
anything
that
appear
to
the
contrary
in
the
grace
of
their
construction
.

fact

everywhere
in
the
material
aspect
of
the

<EOS>
the
M'Choakumchild
school
be
all
fact

and
the
school
of
design
be
all
fact
,
and
the
relation
between
master

be
all

and
everything
be

between
the
lying

so
sacred

so
triumphant

its
assertion

on
well

<EOS>
why
no

not
quite
well

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
dear

!
   
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
Coketown
do
not
come
out
of
its
own
furnace
,
in
all
respect
like
gold
that
have
stand
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
the
perplexing
mystery
of
the
place
be
,
who
belong
to
the
eighteen
denomination
?
<EOS>
because
,
whoever
do
,
the
labour
people
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
strange
to
walk
through
the
street
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
and
note
how
few
of
them
the
barbarous
jangling
of
bell
that
be
drive
the
sick
and
nervous
mad
,
call
away
from
their
own
quarter
,
from
their
own
close
room
,
from
the
corner
of
their
own
street
,
where
they
lounge
listlessly
,
gaze
at
all
the
church
and
chapel
go
,
as
at
a
thing
with
which
they
have
no
manner
of
concern
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
it
merely
the
stranger
who
notice
this
,
because
there
be
a
native
organization
in
Coketown
itself
,
whose
member
be
to
be
hear
of
in
the
House
of
Commons
every
session
,
indignantly
petition
for
act
of
parliament
that
should
make
these
people
religious
by
main
force
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
the
Teetotal
Society
,
who
complain
that
these
same
people
would
get
drunk
,
and
show
in
tabular
statement
that
they
do
get
drunk
,
and
prove
at
tea
party
that
no
inducement
,
human
or
Divine
(
except
a
medal
)
,
would
induce
them
to
forego
their
custom
of
get
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
the
chemist
and
druggist
,
with
other
tabular
statement
,
show
that
when
they
do
not
get
drunk
,
they
take
opium
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
the
experienced
chaplain
of
the
jail
,
with
more
tabular
statement
,
outdo
all
the
previous
tabular
statement
,
and
show
that
the
same
people
would
resort
to
low
haunt
,
hide
from
the
public
eye
,
where
they
hear
low
singing
and
see
low
dancing
,
and
mayhap
join
in
it
;
and
where
a*b
,
aged
twenty
-
four
next
birthday
,
and
commit
for
eighteen
month
'
solitary
,
have
himself
say
(
not
that
he
have
ever
show
himself
particularly
worthy
of
belief
)
<EOS>
his
ruin
begin
,
as
he
be
perfectly
sure
and
confident
that
otherwise
he
would
have
be
a
tip
-
top
moral
speciman
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
Mr
Gradgrind
and
Mr
Bounderby
,
the
two
gentleman
at
this
present
moment
walk
through
Coketown
,
and
both
eminently
practical

who
could

on
occasion
,
furnish
more
tabular
statement
derive
from
their
own
personal
experience
,
and
illustrate
by
case
they
have
know
and
see
,
from
which
it
clearly
appear
---
in
short
,
it
be
the
only
clear
thing
in
the
case

that
these

people
be
a
bad
lot
altogether

that
do
what
you
would

they
be
never
thankful
for
it

they
be
restless

insist
on
Mocha
coffee

reject
all

prime
part
of
meat

and
yet
be
eternally
dissatisfied
and
unmanageable
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
the
moral
of
the
old
nursery
fable
:
   
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
woman
,
and
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
She
live
upon
nothing
but
victual
and
drink
;
victual
and
drink
be
the
whole
of
her
diet
,
and
yet
this
old
woman
would
never
be
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
be
it
possible
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
that
there
be
any
analogy
between
the
case
of
the
Coketown
population
and
the
case
of
the
little
Gradgrinds
?
 
<EOS>
surely
,
none
of
us
in
our
sober
sense
and
acquaint
with
figure
,
be
to
be
tell
at
this
time
of
day
,
that
one
of
the
foremost
element
in
the
existence
of
the
Coketown
working
-
people
have
be
for
score
of
year
,
deliberately
set
at
nought
?
 
<EOS>
that
there
be
any
Fancy
in
them
demand
to
be
bring
into
healthy
existence
instead
of
struggle
on
in
convulsion
?
 
<EOS>
that
exactly
in
the
ratio
as
they
work
long
and
monotonously
,
the
craving
grow
within
them
for
some
physical
relief
---
some
relaxation
,
encourage
good
humour
and
good
spirit
,
and
give
them
a
vent
---
some
recognize
holiday
,
though
it
be
but
for
an
honest
dance
to
a
stirring
band
of
music
---
some
occasional
light
pie
in
which
even
M'Choakumchild
have
no
finger
---
which
craving
must
and
would
be
satisfy
aright
,
or
must
and
would
inevitably
go
wrong
,
until
the
law
of
the
Creation
be
repeal
?

yet
there
be
a
remarkable
gentleness

childishness
about
these

a

They
wonder

the

They
sometimes

after

sit
down

read
mere

more

They
take
De

<EOS>
"
Miss

I

I
do
not

<EOS>
I
think
I
could
not

it
be

prosperous
nation

not

whether
I
be
in
a
thriving
state

not

unless
I
know
who
have
get
the
money
,
and
whether
any
of
it
be
mine

that
have
nothing
to
do
with
it

<EOS>
It
be
not
in
the
figure
at
all
,
"
say
Sissy
,
wipe
her
eye

<EOS>

that
be
a
great
mistake
of
yours

Louisa

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Miss
Louisa
,
I
know
it
be
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
then
Mr
M'Choakumchild
say
he
would
try
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
this
schoolroom
be
an
immense
town
,
and
in
it
there
be
a
million
of
inhabitant
,
and
only
five
-
and
-
twenty
be
starve
to
death
in
the
street
,
in
the
course
of
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
your
remark
on
that
proportion
?
 
<EOS>
and
my
remark
be
---
for
I
could
not
think
of
a
well
one
---
that
I
think
it
must
be
just
as
hard
upon
those
who
be
starve
,
whether
the
other
be
a
million
,
or
a
million
million
.
 
<EOS>

that
be
wrong

too

<EOS>

of
course
it

<EOS>
"
then
Mr

say
he
would
try
me
once
more

,
here
be
the
stuttering

<EOS>
"
yes
,
Miss

they
always
remind
me
of
stuttering
,

that
be
another
of
my
mistake

of
accident
upon

I
find
(
Mr

that
in
a
give
time
a
hundred
thousand
person
go
to
sea
on
long
voyage

only
five
hundred
of
them
be

<EOS>
what
be
the
percentage

<EOS>

I
say
,
Miss

here

extreme
contrition

and
the
bad
of
all
be
,
that
although
my
poor

although
I

yes

then

lately

they
very
often
would
not

I
hope
so

father
say
I
be

It
be
because
he
grow
so
scared

tremble

because
he
feel
himself
to
be
a
poor

weak

ignorant

helpless
man

those

"
there

<EOS>
I
keep
the

ready

and
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
come
back

<EOS>
every
letter
that
I
see
in
Mr
Gradgrind
's
hand
take
my
breath
away
and
blind
my
eye
,
for
I
think
it
come
from
father
,
or
from
Mr
Sleary
about
father
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sleary
promise
to
write
as
soon
as
ever

should
be
hear
of

I
trust
to
him
to
keep

Tom

with
an
impatient
whistle

"
He
will
be
off

you

<EOS>
after
this
,
whenever
Sissy
drop
a
curtsey
to
Mr
Gradgrind
in
the
presence
of
his
family
,
and
say
in
a
faltering
way
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
for
be
troublesome
---
but
---
have
you
have
any
letter
yet
about
me
?
"
 
Louisa
would
suspend
the
occupation
of
the
moment
,
whatever
it
be
,
and
look
for
the
reply
as
earnestly
as
Sissy
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
Mr
Gradgrind
regularly
answer
,
"
no
,
Jupe
,
nothing
of
the
sort
,
"
the
trembling
of
Sissy
's
lip
would
be
repeat
in
Louisa
's
face
,
and
her
eye
would
follow
Sissy
with
compassion
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
usually
improve
these
occasion
by
remark
,
when
she
be
go
,
that
if
Jupe
have
be
properly
train
from
an
early
age
she
would
have
remonstrate
to
herself
on
sound
principle
the
baselessness
of
these
fantastic
hope
.
 
<EOS>
yet
it
do
seem
(
though
not
to
him
,
for
he
see
nothing
of
it
)
as
if
fantastic
hope
could
take
as
strong
a
hold
as
fact
.
   
<EOS>
this
observation
must
be
limit
exclusively
to
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Tom
,
he
be
become
that
not
unprecedented
triumph
of
calculation
which
be
usually
at
work
on
number
one
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
if
she
say
anything
on
the
subject
,
she
would
come
a
little
way
out
of
her
wrapper
,
like
a
feminine
dormouse
,
and
say
:
   
"
good
gracious
bless
me
,
how
my
poor
head
be
vex
and
worry
by
that
girl
Jupe
's
so
perseveringly
ask
,
over
and
over
again
,
about
her
tiresome
letter
!
 
<EOS>
upon
my
word
and
honour
I
seem
to
be
fate
,
and
destine
,
and
ordain
,
to
live
in
the
midst
of
thing
that
I
be
never
to
hear
the
last
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
really
be
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
that
it
appear
as
if
I
never
be
to
hear
the
last
of
anything
!
"
   
<EOS>
at
about
this
point
,
Mr
Gradgrind
's
eye
would
fall
upon
her
;
and
under
the
influence
of
that
wintry
piece
of
fact
,
she
would
become
torpid
again

It

He

He

Old

a

on

his

Old

may
have

for
a
particularly
intelligent

in
his

He

He

thousand

He

<EOS>
what

the

Old

which
the
stoppage

always
produce

the
sensation
of
its
have

stop
in
his

<EOS>
"
yet
I
do
not

Rachael

still

say
he
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
wet
night
,
and
many
group
of
young
woman
pass
him
,
with
their
shawl
draw
over
their
bare
head
and
hold
close
under
their
chin
to
keep
the
rain
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
Rachael
well
,
for
a
glance
at
any
one
of
these
group
be
sufficient
to
show
him
that
she
be
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
there
be
no
more
to
come
;
and
then
he
turn
away
,
say
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
,
"
why
,
then
,
ha
'
miss
her

"
   
<EOS>
but
,
he
have
not
go
the
length
of
three
street
,
when
he
see
another
of
the
shawled
figure
in
advance
of
him

at
which
he
look
so
keenly
that
perhaps
its
mere
shadow
indistinctly
reflect
on
the
wet
pavement
---
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
see
it
without
the
figure
itself
move
along
from
lamp
to
lamp
,
brightening
and
fade
as
it
go
---
would
have
be
enough
to
tell
him
who
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
make
his
pace
at
once
much
quicker
and
much
soft
,
he
dart
on
until
he

very
near
this

then
fall
into
his
former
walk

call

<EOS>
She
turn

a
quiet
oval

dark

rather
delicate

irradiate
by
a

very
gentle

and
further
set
off
by
the
perfect
order
of
her
shine
black
hair

<EOS>
It
be

She
ask
him
,
when

with
her
before

how

she
lift
it

though
he
would
have
prevent
her

and
put
it
to
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
what
harmony
,
besides
her
age
and
her
simplicity
,
surround
her
,
he
do
not
know
,
but
even
in
this
fantastic
action
there
be
a
something
neither
out
of
time
nor
place
:
 
a
something
which
it
seem
as
if
nobody
else
could
have
make
as
serious
,
or
do
with
such
a
natural
and
touching
air
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
be
at
his
loom
full
half
an
hour
,
think
about
this
old
woman
<EOS>
,
when
,
have
occasion
to
move
round
the
loom
for
its
adjustment
,
he
glance
through
a
window
which
be
in
his
corner
,
and
see
her
still
look
up
at
the
pile
of
building
,
lose
in
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
heedless
of
the
smoke
and
mud
and
wet
,
and
of
her
two
long
journey
,
she
be
gaze
at
it
,
as
if
the
heavy
thrum
that
issue
from
its
many
story
be
proud
music
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
go
by
and
by
,
and
the
day
go
after
her
,
and
the
light
spring
up
again
,
and
the
Express
whirl
in
full
sight
of
the
Fairy
Palace
over
the
arch
near
:
 
<EOS>
little
feel
amid
the
jarring
of
the
machinery
,
and
scarcely
hear
above
its
crash
and
rattle
.
 
<EOS>
long
before
then
his
thought
have
go
back
to
the
dreary
room
above
the
little
shop
,
and
to
the
shameful
figure
heavy
on
the
bed
,
but
heavier
on
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
machinery
slacken
;
throb
feebly
like
a
fainting
pulse
;
stop
.
 
<EOS>
the
bell
again
;
the
glare
of
light
and
heat
dispel
;
the
factory
,
loom
heavy
in
the
black
wet
night
---
their
tall
chimney
rise
up
into
the
air
like
compete
Towers
of
Babel
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
Rachael
only
last
night
,
it
be
true
,
and
have
walk
with
her
a
little
way
;
but
he
have
his
new
misfortune
on
him
,
in
which
no
one
else
could
give
him
a
moment
's
relief
,
and
,
for
the
sake
of
it
,
and
because
he
know
himself
to
want
that
soften
of
his
anger
which
no
voice
but
hers
could
effect
,
he
feel
he
may
so
far
disregard
what
she
have
say
as
to
wait
for
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
wait
,
but
she
have
elude
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
on
no
other
night
in
the
year
could
he
so
ill
have
spare
her
patient
face
.
   
<EOS>
o
!
 
<EOS>
well
to
have
no
home
in
which
to
lay
his
head
,
than
to
have
a
home
and
dread
to
go
to
it
,
through
such
a
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
eat
and
drank
,
for
he
be
exhaust
---
but
he
little
know
or
care
what
;
and
he
wander
about
in
the
chill
rain
,
think
and
thinking
,
and
brooding
and
brooding
.
   
<EOS>
no
word
of
a
new
marriage
have
ever
pass
between
them
;
but
Rachael
have
take
great
pity
on
him
year
ago
,
and
to
her
alone
he
have
open
his
close
heart
all
this
time
,
on
the
subject
of
his
misery
;
and
he
know
very
well
that
if
he
be
free
to
ask
her
,
she
would
take
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
home
he
may
at
that
moment
have
be
seek
with
pleasure
and
pride
;
of
the
different
man
he
may
have
be
that
night
;
of
the
lightness
then
in
his
now
heavy
-
laden
breast
;
of
the
then
restore
honour
,
self
-
respect
,
and
tranquillity
all
tear
to
piece
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
waste
of
the
good
part
of
his
life
,
of
the
change
it
make
in
his
character
for
the
bad
every
day
,
of
the
dreadful
nature
of
his
existence
,
bind
hand
and
foot
,
to
a
dead
woman
,
and
torment
by
a
demon
in
her
shape
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
Rachael
,
how
young
when
they
be
first
bring
together
in
these
circumstance
,
how
mature
now
,
how
soon
to
grow
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
number
of
girl
and
woman
she
have
see
<EOS>
marry
,
how
many
home
with
child
in
them
she
have
see
grow
up
around
her
<EOS>
,
how
she
have
contentedly
pursue
her
own
lone
quiet
path
---
for
him
---
and
how
he
have
sometimes
see
a
shade
of
melancholy
on
her
blessed
face
,
that
smote
him
with
remorse
and
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
the
picture
of
her
up
,
beside
the
infamous
image
of
last
night
;
and
think
,
Could
it
be
,
that
the
whole
earthly
course
of
one
so
gentle
,
good
,
and
self
-
deny
,
be
subjugate
to
such
a
wretch
as
that
!
   
<EOS>
fill
with
these
thought
---
so
fill
that
he
have
an
unwholesome
sense
of
grow
large
,
of
be
place
in
some
new
and
diseased
relation
towards
the
object
among
which
he
pass
,
of
see
the
iris
round
<EOS>
every
misty
light
turn
red
---
he
go
home
for
shelter
.

all
that

most
precious

this

a

and
Stephen
add
to
his
other

the
stern
reflection
,
that
of
all
the

not

out

the

of

from

suspend
breath

with
a

He

She
turn
her
head

the
light
of
her
face
shine
in
upon
the
midnight
of
his
mind

She
sit
by
the
bed
,
watch
and
tend
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
he
see
that
some
one
lie
there
,
and
he
know
too
well
<EOS>
it
must
be
she
;
but
Rachael
's
hand
have
put
a
curtain
up
,
so
that
she
be
screen
from
his
eye

Her
disgraceful
garment
be

be
freshly

<EOS>
It
appear
to
him
that
he
see
all
this
in
Rachael
's
face
,
and
look
at
nothing
besides
.
 
<EOS>
while
look
at
it
,
it
be
shut
out
from
his
view
by
the
soften
tear
that
fill
his

not
before
he
have
see
how
earnestly
she
look
at

how

turn
again
towards

He
close
his
eye
,
more
to

her
than
to
rest
his
weary
head
;
but
,
by
slow
degree
as
he
listen
to
the
great
noise
of
the
wind
<EOS>
,
he
cease
to
hear
it
,
or
it
change
into
the
working
of
his
loom
,

even
into
the
voice
of
the
day

his

include

what

.
 
<EOS>
even
this
imperfect
consciousness
fade
away
at

he
dream
a
long

troubled
dream

that

some
one
on

It
break
from
one
line
in
the
table
of
commandment
at
the
altar
,
and
illuminate
the
building
with
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
sound
through
the
church
,
too
,
as
if
there
be
voice
in
the
fiery
letter

<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
whole
appearance
before
him

around
him

,
and
nothing
be
leave
as
it
have

himself

the
clergyman

They
stand
in
the
daylight
before
a
crowd
so
vast

that
if

space

they

more
numerous

they
all
abhor
him

there
be
not
one
pity

friendly
eye
among
the
million
that
be
fasten
on
his
face

<EOS>
He
stand
on
a
raise
stage

under
his
own
loom
;
and
,
look
up
at
the
shape
the
loom
take
,
and
hear
the
burial
service
distinctly
read
,
he
know
that

in
an
instant
what
he
stand
on
fall
below
him

he
be
go

---
out
of
what
mystery
he
come
back
to
his
usual
life
,
and
to
place
that
he
know
,
he
be
unable
to
consider

but
he
be
back
in
those
place
by
some
mean
,
and
with
this
condemnation
upon
him
,
that
he
be
never
,
in
this
world
or
the
next
,
through
all
the
unimaginable
age
of
eternity
,
to
look
on
Rachael
's
face
or
hear
her
voice
.
<EOS>
wander
to
and
fro
,
unceasingly
,
without
hope
,
and
<EOS>
in
search
of
he
know
not
what
<EOS>
(
he
only
know
that
he
be
doom
to
seek
it
)
,
he
be
the
subject
of
a
nameless
,
horrible
dread
,
a
mortal
fear
of
one
particular
shape
which
everything
take
.
 
<EOS>
Whatsoever
he
look
at
,
grow
into
that
form
sooner
or
later
.
 
<EOS>
the
object
of
his
miserable
existence
be
to
prevent
its
recognition
by
any
one
among
the
various
people
he
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
hopeless
labour
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
lead
them
out
of
room
where
it
be
,
if
he
shut
up
drawer
and
closet
where
it
stand
,
if
he
draw
the
curious
from
place
where
he
know
it
to
be
secrete
,
and
get
them
out
into
the
street
,
the
very
chimney
of
the
mill
assume
that
shape
,
and
round
them
be
the
print
word
.
   
<EOS>
the
wind
be
blow
again
,
the
rain
be
beat
on
the
house
-
top
,
and
the
large
space
through
which
he
have
stray
contract
to
the
four
wall
of
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
save
that
the
fire
have
die
out
,
it
be
as
his
eye
have
close
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
seem
to
have
fall
into
a
doze
,
in
the
chair
by
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
wrap
in
her
shawl
,
perfectly
still
.
 
<EOS>
the
table
stand
in
the
same
place
,
close
by
the
bedside
,
and
on
it
,
in
its
real
proportion
and
appearance
,
be
the
shape
so
often
repeat
.
   
<EOS>
He
think
he
see
the
curtain
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
again
,
and
he
be
sure
it
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
a
hand
come
forth
and
grope
about
a
little
.
<EOS>
then
the
curtain
move
more
perceptibly
,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
put
it
back
,
and
sit
up
.
   
<EOS>
with
her
woful
eye
,
so
haggard
and
wild
,
so
heavy
and
large
,
she
look
all
round
the
room
,
and
pass
the
corner
where
he
sleep
in
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eye
return
to
that
corner
,
and
she
put
her
hand
over
them
as
a
shade
,
while
she
look
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
again
they
go
all
round
the
room
,
scarcely
heed
Rachael
if
at
all
,
and
return
to
that
corner
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
,
as
she
once
more
shade
them
---
not
so
much
look
at
him
,
as
look
for
him
with
a
brutish
instinct
that
he
be
there
---
that
no
single
trace
be
leave
in
those
debauch
feature
,
or
in
the
mind
that
go
along
with
them
,
of
the
woman
he
have
marry
eighteen
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
he
have
see
her
come
to
this
by
inch
<EOS>
,
he
never
could
have
believe
her
to
be
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
as
if
a
spell
be
on
him
,
he
be
motionless
and
powerless
,
except
to
watch
her
.
   
<EOS>
stupidly
doze
,
or
commune
with
her
incapable
self
about
nothing
,
she
sit
for
a
little
while
with
her
hand
at
her
ear
,
and
her
head
rest
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
she
resume
her
staring
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
her
eye
stop
at
the
table
with
the
bottle
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
Straightway
she
turn
her
eye
back
to
his
corner
,
with
the
defiance
of
last
night
,
and
move
very
cautiously
and
softly
,
stretch
out
her
greedy
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
draw
a
mug
into
the
bed
,
and
sit
for
a
while
consider
which
of
the
two
bottle
she
should
choose
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
she
lay
her
insensate
grasp
upon
the
bottle
that
have
swift
and
certain
death
in
it
,
and
,
before
his
eye
,
pull
out
the
cork
with
her
tooth
.
   
<EOS>
dream
or
reality
,
he
have
no
voice
,
nor
have
he
power
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
real
,
and
her
allot
time
be
not
yet
come
,
wake
,
Rachael
,
wake
!
   
<EOS>
She
think
of
that
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
at
Rachael
,
and
very
slowly
,
very
cautiously
,
pour
out
the
content
.
 
<EOS>
the
draught
be
at
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
a
moment
<EOS>
and
she
would
be
past
all
help
,
let
the
whole
world
wake
and
come
about
her
with
its
utmost
power
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
that
moment
Rachael
start
up
with
a
suppress
cry
.
 
<EOS>
the
creature
struggle
,
strike
her
,
seize
her
by
the
hair
;
but
Rachael

<EOS>
the
wind
bring
the
sound
of
the
church
clock
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
They
listen
,
and
it
strike
three
.
 
<EOS>
Stephen
look
at
her
,
see
how
pale
she
be
,
note
the
disorder
of
her
hair
,
and
the
red
mark
of
finger
on
her
forehead
,
and
feel
assured
that
his
sense
of
sight
and
hearing
have
be
awake

<EOS>
She
hold
the
cup
in
her
hand
even
now

<EOS>
"
I

she
say

calmly
pour
from
the
cup
into
the
basin

steep
the

speak
,
she
drain

Father

Mr

be

discomfited

can

upon

"
Father

"
pursue
Louisa
in
exactly
the

voice
as
before

"
do
you
ask

to
love
Mr

<EOS>
"
My

no

<EOS>
no

nothing

<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
she
still
pursue
,
"
do
Mr

ask
me
to
love
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
really
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
it
be
difficult
to
answer
your
question
---
"
   
"
difficult
to
answer
it
,
yes
<EOS>
or
no
,
father
?
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
because
;
"
here
be
something
to
demonstrate
,
and
it
set
him
up
again
;
"
because
the
reply
depend
so
materially
,
Louisa
,
on
the
sense
in
which
we
use
the
expression
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Mr
Bounderby
do
not
do
you
the
injustice
,
and
do
not
do
himself
the
injustice
,
of
pretend
to
anything
fanciful
,
fantastic
,
or
(
I
be
use
synonymous
term
)
sentimental
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
would
have
see
you
grow
up
under
his
eye
,
to
very
little
purpose
,
if
he
could
so
far
forget
what
be
due
to
your
good
sense
,
not
to
say
to
his
,
as
to
address
you
from
any
such
ground
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
perhaps
the
expression
itself
---
I
merely
suggest
this
to
you
,
my
dear
---
may
be
a
little
misplaced
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
advise
me
to
use
in
its
stead
,
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
"
say
Mr
Gradgrind
,
completely
recover
by
this
time
,
"
<EOS>
I
would
advise
you
(
since
you
ask
me
)
to
consider
this
question
,
as
you
have
be
accustom
to
consider
every
other
question
,
simply
as
one
of
tangible
fact
.
 
<EOS>
the
ignorant
and
the
giddy
may
embarrass
such
subject
with
irrelevant
fancy
,
and
other
absurdity
that
have
no
existence
,
properly
view
---
really
no
existence
---
but
it
be
no
compliment
to
you
to
say
,
that
you
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
what
be
the
fact
of
this
case
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
,
we
will
say
in
round
number
,
twenty
year
of
age
;
Mr
Bounderby
be
,
we
will
say
in
round
number
,
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
disparity
in
your
respective
year
,
but
in
your
mean
and
position
there
be
none
;
on
the
contrary
,
there
be
a
great
suitability
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
question
arise
,
be
this
one
disparity
sufficient
to
operate
as
a
bar
to
such
a
marriage
?
 
<EOS>
in
consider
this
question
,
it
be
not
unimportant
to
take
into
account
the
statistic
of
marriage
,
so
far
as
they
have
yet
be
obtain
,
in
England
and
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
on
reference
to
the
figure
,
that
a
large
proportion
of
these
marriage
be
contract
between
party
of
very
unequal
age
,
and
that
the
elder
of
these
contracting
party
be
,
in
rather
more
than
three
-
fourth
of
these
instance
,
the
bridegroom
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
as
show
the
wide
prevalence
of
this
law
,
that
among
the
native
of
the
british
possession
in
India
,
also
in
a
considerable
part
of
China
,
and
among
the
Calmucks
of
Tartary
,
the
good
mean
of
computation
yet
furnish
us
by
traveller
,
yield
similar
result
.
<EOS>
the
disparity
I
have
mention
,
therefore
,
almost
cease
to
be
disparity
,
and
(
virtually
)
all
but
disappear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
recommend
,
father
,
"
ask
Louisa
,
her
reserved
composure
not
in
the
least
affect
by
these
gratifying
result
,
"
that
I
should
substitute
for
the
term
I
use
just
now
?
 
<EOS>
for
the
misplaced
expression
?
"
   
"
Louisa
,
"
return
her
father
,
"
it
appear
to
me
that
nothing
can
be
plainer
.
 
<EOS>
confine
yourself
rigidly
to
Fact
,
the
question
of
fact
you
state
to
yourself
be
:
 
<EOS>
do
Mr
Bounderby
ask
me
to
marry
him
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
sole
remain
question
then
be
:
 
Shall
I
marry
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
nothing
can
be
plain
than
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
marry
him
?

<EOS>
repeat
Louisa
,
with
great
deliberation

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
satisfactory
to
me
,
as
your
father
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
to
know
that
you
do
not
come
to
the
consideration
of
that
question
with
the
previous
habit
of
mind
,
and
habit
of
life

that
belong

many
young

no

"
I
do
not

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
now
leave
you
to
judge
for
yourself
,
"
say
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
state
the
case
,
as
such
case
be
usually
state
among
practical
mind

I
have
state
it
,
as
the
case
of
your
mother
and
myself
be
state
in
its
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
be
for
you
to
decide
.
"
   
<EOS>
from
the
beginning
,
she
have
sit
look
at
him
fixedly
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
now
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
and
bend
his
deep
-
set
eye
upon
her
in
his
turn
,
perhaps
he
may
have
see
one
wavering
moment
in
her
,
when
she
be
impel
to
throw
herself
upon
his
breast
,
and
give
him
the
pen
-
up
confidence
of
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
see
it
,
he
must
have
overleap
at
a
bind
the
artificial
barrier
he
have
for
many
year
be
erect
,
between
himself

and
she

it
with
such
great
condescension
as
well
as
with
such
great
compassion
for
him
,
that
Bounderby
,

far
more
disconcerted
than
if
she
have
throw
her
workbox
at
the
mirror
,
or
swoon
on
the
hearthrug
,
---
cork
up
the
smell
-
salts
tight
in
his
pocket
,
and
think
,
"
now
confound
this
woman
,
who
could
have
even
guess
that
she
would
take
it
in
this
way
!

I
wish
with
all
my

Mrs

in
a
highly
superior
manner
;
somehow
she
seem
,
in
a
moment
,
to
have
establish
a
right
to
pity
him
ever
afterwards
;
"
that
you
may
be
in
all
respect
very
happy

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam

return
Bounderby
,
with
some
resentment
in
his
tone
:
 
which
be
clearly
lower
,
though
in
spite
of
himself
,
"
I
be
oblige
to

do
you

say
Mrs

with
great
affability

but
naturally
you
do

course
you
do

a
very
awkward
pause
on
Mr
Bounderby

part
,
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
sedately
resume
her
work
and
occasionally
give
a
small
cough
,
which
sound
like
the
cough
of
conscious
strength
and
forbearance

<EOS>
"
well
,
madam

"
resume
Bounderby

"
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance

I
imagine
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
a
character
like
your

remain
here

though
you
would
be
very
welcome
here

"
   
<EOS>
"
oh

no

I
could

Mrs

shake
her
head
,
still
in

highly
superior
manner

and
a
little
change
the
small
cough

cough
now
,
as
if
the
spirit
of
prophecy

within
her

have
better
be
cough
down

<EOS>
"
however
,
madam

Bounderby

"
there
be
apartment
at
the
Bank

where
a
bear

lady

be
rather
a
catch

otherwise

<EOS>
"
Sir

rejoin
Mrs

no

<EOS>
in
yield
up
my

I
shall
not

free
from
the

the

<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
Bounderby
to

however

effect
in
the
Bank
 
<EOS>
a
sunny
midsummer
day
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
thing
sometimes
,
even
in
Coketown
.
   
<EOS>
see
from
a
distance
in
such
weather
,
Coketown
lie
shroud
in
a
haze
of
its
own
,
which
appear
impervious
to
the
sun
's
ray
.
 
<EOS>
You
only
know
the
town
be
there
,
because
you
know
there
could
have
be
no
such
sulky
blotch
upon
the
prospect
without

smoke

now
confusedly
tend
this
way
,
now
that
way
,
now
aspire
to
the
vault
of
Heaven
,
now
murkily
creep
along
the
earth
,
as
the
wind
rise
and
fall
,
or
change
its
quarter
:
 
a
dense
formless
jumble
,
with
sheet
of
cross
light
in
it
,
that
show
nothing
but
masse
of
darkness
:
---
coketown
in
the
distance
be
suggestive
of
itself
,
though
not
a
brick
of
it
could
be
see
.
   
<EOS>
the
wonder
be
,
it
be
there
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
ruin
so
often
,
that
it
be
amazing
how
it
have
bear
so
many
shock
.
 
<EOS>
surely
there
never
be
such
fragile
china
-
ware
as
that
of
which
the
miller
of
Coketown
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
handle
them
never
so
lightly
,
and
they
fall
to
piece
with
such
ease
that
you
may
suspect
them
of
have
be
flaw
before
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
ruin
,
when
they
be
require
to
send
labour
child
to
school
;
they
be
ruin
when
inspector
be
appoint
to
look
into
their
work
;
they
be
ruin
,
when
such
inspector
consider
it
doubtful
whether
they
be
quite
justified
in
chop
people
up
with
their
machinery
;
they
be
utterly
undone
,
when
it
be
hint
that
perhaps
they
need
not
always
make
quite
so
much
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
besides
Mr
Bounderby
's
gold
spoon
which
be
generally
receive
in
Coketown
,
another
prevalent
fiction
be
very
popular
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
take
the
form
of
a
threat
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
a
Coketowner
feel
he
be
ill
-
use
---
that
be
to
say
,
whenever
he
be
not
leave
entirely
alone
,
and
it
be
propose
to
hold
him
accountable
for
the
consequence
of
any
of
his
act
---
he
be
sure
to
come
out
with
the
awful
menace
,
that
he
would
"
sooner
pitch
his
property
into
the
Atlantic
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
have
terrify
the
Home
Secretary
within
an
inch
of
his
life
,
on
several
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
the
Coketowners
be
so
patriotic
after
all
,
that
they
never
have
pitch
their
property
into
the
Atlantic
yet
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
be
kind
enough
to
take
mighty
good
care
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
it
be
,
in
the
haze
yonder
;
and
it
increase
and
multiply
.
   
<EOS>
the
street
be
hot
and
dusty
on
the
summer
day
,
and
the
sun
be
so
bright
that
it

Coketown
question

<EOS>
"
why
,

reply
Mr

"
it
suit
my
disposition

with

when
I
make
his
acquaintance

<EOS>
I
have
only
one
thing
more
to
say
to
you

Mr

before
assure
you

You
be

do
not
you
deceive
yourself
by
suppose
for
a
moment
that
I
be
a
man
of

I
be

if

Bounderby

we
may
shake

I
say

equal
term

I

watchful

so
cold

proud

sensitively
ashamed

braggart
humility

from
which
she
shrink
as

every

should
be
incapable

unaccountable

inconvenience

and

!
   
<EOS>
Slackbridge
act
as
fugleman
,
and
give
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
multitude
of
doubtful
face
(
a
little
conscience
-
stricken
)
brighten
at
the
sound
,
and
take
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
private
feeling
must
yield
to
the

.
 
<EOS>
Hurrah

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
thus
easily
do
Stephen
Blackpool
fall
into
the
lonely
of
life
,
the
life
of
solitude
among
a
familiar
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
in
the
land
who
look
into
ten
thousand
face
for
some
answering
look
and
never
find
it
,
be
in
cheer
society
as
compare
with
him
who
pass
ten
averted
face
daily
,
that
be
once
the
countenance
of
friend
.
 
<EOS>
such
experience
be
to
be
Stephen
's
now
,
in
every
wake
moment
of
his
life
;
at
his
work
,
on
his
way
to
it
and
from
it
,
at
his
door
,
at
his
window
,
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
by
general
consent
,
they
even
avoid
that
side
of
the
street
on
which
he
habitually
walk
;
and
leave
it
,
of
all
the
work
man
,
to
him
only
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
be
for
many
year
,
a
quiet
silent
man
,
associate
but
little
with
other
man
,
and
use
to
companionship
with
his
own
thought
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
know
before
the
strength
of
the
want
in
his
heart
for
the
frequent
recognition
of
a
nod
,
a
look
,
a
word
;
or
the
immense
amount
of
relief
that
have
be
pour
into
it
by
drop
through
such
small
mean
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
even
hard
than
he
could
have
believe
possible
,
to
separate
in
his
own
conscience
his
abandonment
by
all
his
fellow
from
a
baseless
sense
of
shame
and
disgrace
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
four
day
of
his
endurance
be
day
so
long
and
heavy
,
that
he
begin
to
be
appal
by
the
prospect
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
do
he
see
no
Rachael
all
the
time
,
but
he
avoid
every
chance
of
see
her
;
for
,
<EOS>
although
he
know
that
the
prohibition
do
not
yet
formally
extend
to
the
woman
work
in
the
factory
,
he
find
that
some
of
them
with
whom
he
be
acquaint
be
change
to
him
,
and
he
fear
to
try
other
,
and
dread
that
Rachael
may
be
even
single
out
from
the
rest
if
she
be
see
in
his
company
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
have
be
quite
alone
during
the
four
day
,
and
have
speak
to
no
one
,
when
,
as
he
be
leave
his
work
at
night
,
a
young
man
of
a
very
light
complexion
accost
him
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your

say
the
young

<EOS>
He

turn
about

betook
himself

Herein

him
.
<EOS>
before
he
have
so
much
as
close
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
's
door
,
he
have
reflect
that
at
least
his
be
oblige
to
go
away
be
good
for
her
,
as
it
would
save
her
from
the
chance
of
be
bring
into
question
for
not
withdraw
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
though
it
would
cost
him
a
hard
pang
to
leave
her
,
and
though
he
could
think
of
no
similar
place
in
which
his
condemnation
would
not
pursue
him
,
perhaps
it
be
almost
a
relief
to
be
force
away
from
the
endurance
of
the
last
four
day
,
even
to
unknown
difficulty
and
distress

<EOS>
so
he
say
,
with
truth
,
"
I

leetsome

under

than
I
could'n

<EOS>
It
be
not
her
part
to
make
his
burden
heavy
.
 
<EOS>
She
answer
with
her
comfort
smile
,
and
the
three
walk
on
together
.
   
<EOS>
age
,
especially
when
it
strive
to
be
self

reliant

cheerful
,

much
consideration
among

<EOS>
the
old
woman
be
so
decent

contented
,
and
make
so
light
of
her
infirmity
,
though
they
have
increase
upon
her
since
her
former
interview
with
Stephen
,
that
they
both
take
an
interest
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
too
sprightly
to
allow
of
their
walking
at
a
slow
pace
on
her
account
,
but
she
be
very
grateful
to
be
talk
to

very
willing

talk
to
any
extent
:
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
they

to
their
part

she
be
more
brisk

vivacious
than

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
They
comply
,
and
the
three
go
on
to
the
house
where
he
lodge
.
<EOS>
when
they
turn
into
a
narrow
street
,
Stephen
glance
at
his
window
with
a
dread
that
always
haunt
his
desolate
home
;
but
it
be
open
,
as
he
have
leave
it
,
and
no
one
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
evil
spirit
of
his
life
have
flit
away
again
,
month
ago
,
and
he
have
hear
no
more
of
her
since
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
evidence
of
her
last
return
now
,
be
the
scanty
moveable
in
his
room
,
and
the
grayer
hair
upon
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
He
light
a
candle
,
set
out
his
little
tea
-
board
,
get
hot
water
from
below
,
and
bring
in
small
portion
of
tea
and
sugar
,
a
loaf
,
and
some
butter
from
the
near
shop
.
 
<EOS>
the
bread
be
new
and
crusty
,
the
butter
fresh
,
and
the
sugar
lump
,
of
course
---
in
fulfilment
of
the
standard
testimony
of
the
Coketown
magnate
,
that
these
people
live
like
prince
,
sir

<EOS>
Rachael
make
the
tea
(
so
large
a
party
necessitate
the
borrowing
of
a
cup
)
,
and
the
visitor

it
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the

glimpse
of
sociality

He

<EOS>
for
the
first
time

Louisa
have
come
into
one
of
the
dwelling

the
Coketown
Hands
;
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
be
face
to
face
with
anything
like
individuality
in
connection
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
of
their
existence
by
hundred

by
thousand

<EOS>
She

a

She

from

but
she
know
from
her
read
infinitely
more
of
the
way
of

insect
than
of
these
toil
man

woman
.
   
<EOS>
something
to
be
work
so
much
and
pay
so
much
,
and
there
end
;
something
to
be
infallibly
settle
by
law
of
supply
and
demand
;
something
that
blunder
against
those
law
,
and
flounder
into
difficulty
<EOS>
;
something
that
be
a
little
pinched
when
wheat
be
dear
,
and
over
-
eat
itself
when
wheat
be
cheap
;
something
that
increase
at
such
a
rate
of
percentage
,
and
yield
such
another
percentage
of
crime
,
and
such
another
percentage
of
pauperism
;
something
wholesale
,
of
which
vast
fortune
be

something
that
occasionally
rise
like
a
sea
,
and
do
some
harm

waste

chiefly
to

fall
again

She
stand

Rachael
raise

no

I

redden
at

I
recollect

now

to

It

my

I
should
ask

credit

I
ought

<EOS>
as
Stephen
have
but
a
little
while
ago
instinctively
address
himself
to
her

so
she
now
instinctively

herself
to
Rachael

manner
be
short

abrupt

falter

timid

have
tell
you

Rachael
shake
her
head
in
silence

"
He
fall
into
suspicion

weaver

Stephen

remain
quietly
attentive

with
his

at

He

fine

perhaps

It

he

do
not

<EOS>
He
interwove

to
be
sure
,
the

Mr

you

my

not

,
Mr

I
do
not

<EOS>
I
may
have
want
more

she

then
she
ought

<EOS>
She
could
get

<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
pretend

a

I

you

she
do
not
marry
old
Bounderby
for

for

for

then
why

I

out

for

<EOS>
She
be
not

what
she

do
with
it

she
be
sharp
enough

she
could

coax
it
out

why

no

there
she

easily

I

I

"

there
be
a
piece

ornamental
water
immediately
below

on

into

Mr

on

leave
him
at

poor
fool

that
this
condition
be
impose
upon

explosion
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
be
too
bright
a
morning
for
sleep
,
and
James
Harthouse
rise
early
,
and
sit
in
the
pleasant
bay
window
of
his
dressing
-
room
,
smoke
the
rare
tobacco
that
have
have
so
wholesome
an
influence
on
his
young
friend
.
 
<EOS>
repose
in
the
sunlight
,
with
the
fragrance
of
his
eastern
pipe
about
him
,
and
the
dreamy
smoke
vanish
into
the
air
,
so
rich
and
soft
with
summer
odour
,
he
reckon
up
his
advantage
as
an
idle
winner
may
count
his
gain
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
all
bore
for
the
time
,
and
could
give
his
mind
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
establish
a
confidence
with
her
,
from
which
her
husband
be
exclude
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
establish
a
confidence
with
her
,
that
absolutely
turn
upon
her
indifference
towards
her
husband
,
and
the
absence
,
now
and
at
all
time
,
of
any
congeniality
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
artfully
,
but
plainly
,
assure
her
that
he
know
her
heart
in
its
last
most
delicate
recess
;
he
have
come
so
near
to
her
through
its
tender
sentiment
;
he
have
associate
himself
with
that
feeling
;
and
the
barrier
behind
which
she
live
,
have
melt
away
.
 
<EOS>
all
very
odd
,
and
very
satisfactory
!
   
<EOS>
and
yet
he
have
not
,
even
now
,
any
earnest
wickedness
of
purpose
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
publicly
and
privately
,
it
be
much
well
for
the
age
in
which
he
live
,
that
he
and
the
legion
of
whom
he
be
one
be
designedly
bad
,
than
indifferent
and
purposeless
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
drift
iceberg
set
with
any
current
anywhere
,
that
wreck
the
ship
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
Devil
goeth
about
like
a
roar
lion
,
he
goeth
about
in
a
shape
by
which
few
but
savage
and
hunter
be
attract
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
he
be
trim
,
smooth
,
and
varnish
,
accord
to
the
mode
;
when
he
be
aweary
of
vice
,
and
aweary
of
virtue
,
use
up
as
to
brimstone
,
and
use
up
as
to
bliss
;
then
,
whether
he
take
to
the
serving
out
of
red
tape
,
or
to
the
kindling
of
red
fire
,
he
be
the
very
Devil
.
   
<EOS>
so
James
Harthouse
recline
in
the
window
,
indolently
smoke
,
and
reckon
up
the
step
he
have
take
on
the
road
by
which
he
happen
to
be
travel
.
 
<EOS>
the
end
to
which
it
lead
be
before
him
,
pretty
plainly
;
but
he
trouble
himself
with
no
calculation
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
will
be
,
will
be
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
have
rather
a
long
ride
to
take
that
day
---
for
there
be
a
public
occasion
"
to
do
"
at
some
distance
,
which
afford
a
tolerable
opportunity
of
go
in
for
the
Gradgrind
man
<EOS>
---
he
dress
early
and
go
down
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
to
see
if
she
have
relapse
since
the
previous
evening
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
resume
where
he
have
leave
off
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
look
of
interest
for
him
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
get
through
the
day
as
much
(
or
as
little
)
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
as
be
to
be
expect
under
the
fatigue
circumstance
;
and
come
ride
back
at
six
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
sweep
of
some
half
-
mile
between
the
lodge
and
the
house
,
and
he
be
ride
along
at
a
foot
pace
over
the
smooth
gravel
,
once
nickit
's
,
when
Mr
Bounderby
burst
out
of
the
shrubbery
,
with
such
violence
as
to
make
his
horse
shy
across
the
road

Mr

red

plant
himself
in

the
night
on

laundry

true

it

my
duty

remember

"
Mrs

be
fond
of
observe
with
a
lofty
grace

when
any
of
the
domestic

remembrance

Mr

Powler

do
so

I
should
think
it

right

do
so

"
 
<EOS>
the
same
hermitical
state
of
mind
lead
to
her
renunciation
of
make
dish
and
wine
at
dinner
,
until
fairly
command
by
Mr
Bounderby
to
take
them
;
when
she
say
,
"
indeed
you
be
very
good
,
sir
;
"
and
depart
from
a
resolution
of
which
she
have
make
rather
formal
and
public
announcement
,
to
"
wait
for
the
simple
mutton
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
likewise
deeply
apologetic
for
want
the
salt
;
and
,
feel
amiably
bind
to
bear
out
Mr
Bounderby
to
the
full
extent
in
the
testimony
he
have
bear
to
her
nerve
,
occasionally
sit
back
in
her
chair
and
silently
weep
;
at
which
period
a
tear
of
large
dimension
,
like
a
crystal
ear

ring
,
may
be
observe
(
or
rather
,
must
be

for
it
insist
on
public
notice

slide
down
her
roman
nose
.
   
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Sparsit
's
great
point
,
first
and
last
,
be
her
determination
to
pity
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
occasion
when
in
look
at
him
she
be
involuntarily
move
to
shake
her
head
,
as
who
would
say
,
"
alas
,
poor
yorick
!
"
 
<EOS>
after
allow
herself
to
be
betray
into
these
evidence
of
emotion
,
she
would
force
a
lambent
brightness
,
and
would
be
fitfully
cheerful
,
and
would
say
,
"
You
have
still
good
spirit
,
sir
,
I
be
thankful
to
find
;
"
and
would
appear
to
hail
it
as
a
blessed
dispensation
that
Mr
Bounderby
bear
up
as
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
one
idiosyncrasy
for
which
she
often
apologize
<EOS>

she
find
it
excessively
difficult

<EOS>
She
have
a
curious
propensity

Mrs

Miss

and
yield
to
it
some
three
or
four
score
time
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Her
repetition
of
this
mistake
cover
Mrs
Sparsit
with
modest
confusion
;
but
indeed
,
she
say
,
it
seem
so
natural
to
say
Miss
Gradgrind
:
 
whereas
,
to
persuade
herself
that
the
young

she
have

the
happiness
of

child
could
be
really

truly
<EOS>
Mrs

she
find
almost
impossible

<EOS>
It
be
a
further
singularity
of

remarkable
case

that
the
more
she
think
about
it

the

impossible
it

at

She

She

then

round
,

the

over

and
lie
as

him

<EOS>
She
stand
for
some

at

She
stop
at

,
look
back
when

ask
him
if

call
her

but
he
lie
still

and
she
softly
close
the
door

the
wretched

look
cautiously
up

creep
out

fasten
his

and
throw
himself
upon
his

morosely
cry

grudgingly
love
her

hatefully

impenitently

<EOS>
hear
the
last
of
it
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
,
lie
by
to
recover
the
tone
of
her
nerve
in
Mr
Bounderby
's
retreat
,
keep
such
a
sharp
look
-
out
,
night
and
day
,
under
her
coriolanian
eyebrow
,
that
her
eye
,
like
a
couple
of
lighthouse
on
an
iron
-
bind
coast
,
may
have
warn
all
prudent
mariner
from
that
bold
rock
her
roman
nose
and
the
dark
and
craggy
region
in
its
neighbourhood
,
but
for
the
placidity
of
her
manner
.
<EOS>
although
it
be
hard
to
believe
that
her
retire
for
the
night
could
be
anything
but
a
form
,
so
severely
wide
awake
be
those
classical
eye
of
her
,
and
so
impossible
do
it
seem
that
her
rigid
nose
could
yield
to
any
relaxing
influence
,
yet
her
manner
of
sit
,
smooth
her
uncomfortable
,
not
to
say
,
gritty
mitten
<EOS>
(
they
be
construct
of
a
cool
fabric
like
a
meat
-
safe
)
,
or
of
amble
to
unknown
place
of
destination
with
her
foot
in
her
cotton
stirrup
,
be
so
perfectly
serene
,
that
most
observer
would
have
be
constrain
to
suppose
her
a
dove
,
embody
by
some
freak
of
nature
,
in
the
earthly
tabernacle
of
a
bird
of
the
hook
-
beak
order
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
a
most
wonderful
woman
for
prowl
about
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
how
she
get
from
story
to
story
be
a
mystery
beyond
solution
.
 
<EOS>
a
lady
so
decorous
in
herself
,
and
so
highly
connected
,
be
not
to
be
suspect
of
drop
over
the
banister
or
slide
down
them
,
yet
her
extraordinary
facility
of
locomotion
suggest
the
wild
idea
.
<EOS>
another
noticeable
circumstance
in
Mrs
Sparsit
be
,
that
she
be
never
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
shoot
with
consummate
velocity
from
the
roof
to
the
hall
,
yet
would
be
in
full
possession
of
her
breath
and
dignity
on
the
moment
of
her
arrival
there
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
she
ever
see
by
human
vision
to
go
at
a
great
pace
.
   
<EOS>
She
take
very
kindly
to
Mr
Harthouse
,
and
have
some
pleasant
conversation
with
him
soon
after
her
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
him
her
stately
curtsey
in
the
garden
,
one
morning
before
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
appear
but
yesterday
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
that
I
have
the
honour
of
receive
you
at
the
Bank
,
when
you
be
so
good
as
to
wish

be
make
acquaint
with
Mr

's
address
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
an
occasion

by
myself
in

"
say
Mr
Harthouse
,
incline
his
head
to
Mrs
Sparsit
with
the
most
indolent
of
all
possible
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
live
in
a
singular
world
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
the
honour
,
by
a
coincidence
of
which
I
be
proud
,
to
have
make
a
remark
,
similar
in
effect
,
though
not
so
epigrammatically
express
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
singular
world
,
I
would
say
,
sir

"
pursue
Mrs
Sparsit
;
after
acknowledge
the
compliment
with
a
drooping
of
her
dark
eyebrow
,
not
altogether
so
mild
in
its
expression
as
her
voice
be
in
its
dulcet
tone
;
"
as
regard
the
intimacy
we
form
at
one
time
,
with
individual
<EOS>
we
be
quite
ignorant
of
,
at
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
recall
,
sir
,
that
on
that
occasion
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
you
be
actually
apprehensive
of
Miss
Gradgrind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
memory
do
me
more
honour
than
my
insignificance
deserve

<EOS>
I
avail
myself
of
your
obliging
hint
to
correct
my
timidity
,
and
it
be
unnecessary
to
add
that
they
be
perfectly

<EOS>
Mrs

talent

combination

"
 
<EOS>
He
be
almost
fall
asleep
over
this
compliment
;
it
take
him
so
long
to
get
through
,
and
his
mind
wander
so
much
in
the
course
of
its
execution
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
find
Miss
Gradgrind
<EOS>
---
I
really
can
not
call
her
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
;
it
be
very
absurd
of
me

as
youthful
as
I
describe

"
<EOS>
ask
Mrs

,
sweetly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
draw
her

<EOS>
"
It

"
that
Miss

I

me
considerably

ay

indeed
here

Mr

"
<EOS>
cry
Mrs
Sparsit
,
nod
her
head
a
great
many
time
,
as
if
she
have
be
talk
and
think
of
no
one
else

<EOS>
"
how
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
,
sir

<EOS>
Pray
let
us
see
you
cheerful

"
   
<EOS>
now
,
these
persistent
assuagement
of
his
misery
,
and
lightening
of
his
load
,
have
by
this
time
begin
to
have
the
effect
of
make
Mr
Bounderby
soft
than
usual
towards
Mrs
Sparsit
,
and
hard
than
usual
to
most
other
people
from
his
wife
downward
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
Mrs
Sparsit
say
with
force
lightness
of
heart
,
"
You
want
your
breakfast
,
sir

but
I
dare
say
Miss

will
soon
be
here

Mr

reply
,
"
if
I
wait
to

take
care
of
by
my

madam
,
I
believe
you
know
<EOS>
pretty
well
I
should
wait
till
Doomsday

so
I
will
trouble
you
to
take
charge
of
the
teapot

"
 
<EOS>
Mrs

comply
,
and
assume
her
old
position
at
table

<EOS>
this
again
make
the
excellent

vastly
sentimental

<EOS>
She
be
so
humble

that
when

she
rise
,
protest
she
never

have
have
the
honour
of
make
Mr

breakfast

before
Mrs

she
beg
pardon
,
she
mean
to
say
Miss

she
hope
to
be
excuse

but
she
really
could
not
get
it
right
yet
,
though
she
trust
to
become
familiar
with
it
by
and
by
---
have
assume
her
present
position
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
(
she
observe
)
because
Miss
Gradgrind
happen
to
be
a
little
late
,
and
Mr
Bounderby
's
time
be
so
very
precious
,
and
she
know
it
of
old
to
be
so
essential
that
he
should
breakfast
to
the
moment
,
that
she
have
take
the
liberty

"

in

what

I

I
do

"
I
suppose
no

ever
have
occasion

diffident

delicate

Louisa
answer
him
composedly
:
 
"
I
have
never

objection

you

I
do
not

"
have

return
Mr

<EOS>
"
nothing

otherwise

She
look
at
him

the
table
and
make
the
teacup
ring

with
a
proud
colour
in
her
face
that
be
a
new
change

Mr

<EOS>
"
You
be
incomprehensible
this
morning

Louisa

<EOS>
"
pray
take
no

I

what

it
matter

<EOS>
nothing
more
be
say
on
this
theme
,
and
Mr
Harthouse
be
soon
idly
gay
on
indifferent
subject

<EOS>
but
from
this
day
,
the
Sparsit
action
upon
Mr
Bounderby
throw
Louisa
and
James
Harthouse
more
together
,
and
strengthen
the
dangerous
alienation
from
her
husband
and
confidence
against
him
with
another
,
into
which
she
have
fall
by
degree
so
fine
that
she
could
not
retrace
them

she
try

whether
she

Mrs

that

assist
Mr

to
his

after
breakfast

be
then
alone
with
him
in
the
hall
,
she
imprint
a
chaste
kiss
upon
his
hand
,
murmur
"
My

retire
,
overwhelm
with
grief

<EOS>
yet
it
be
an
indubitable
fact

that
five

Mr

It
be
a
hasty
note

inform
Louisa

very
ill

She

notwithstanding

Mr

She
sit
by
Mr

together

Mrs

It

down
the
wooden

little
station
into
a
stony
road
,
cross
it
into
a
green
lane
,
and
become
hidden
in
a
summer
-
growth
of
leave
and
branch

<EOS>
one

two
late
bird

chirp
in

and
a

heavily

and
the
reek
of

tread

thick
dust
that

be
all
Mrs

She
go
up

Most

She
try
the
garden
with
no

<EOS>
She
think
of
the
wood

steal
towards
it

heedless
of
long
grass

brier

of
worm

snail

with

Mrs

softly
crush
her

through
the
thick
undergrowth

so
intent
upon
her
object

she

would
have

Hark

She
draw
herself
up

and
stand
behind
a

like
Robinson

so
near

He

He

Thing
Needful
 
Louisa
awake
from
a
torpor
,
and
her
eye
languidly
open
on
her
old
bed
at
home
,
and
her
old
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
,
at
first
,
as
if
all
that
have
happen
since
the
day
when
these
object
be
familiar
to
her
be
the
shadow
of
a
dream
,
but
gradually
,
as
the
object
become
more
real
to
her
sight
,
the
event
become
more
real
to
her
mind
.
   
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
move
her
head
for
pain
and
heaviness
,
her
eye
be
strain
and
sore
,
and
she
be
very
weak
.
 
<EOS>
a
curious
passive
inattention
have
such
possession
of
her
,
that
the
presence
of
her
little
sister
in
the
room
do
not
attract
her
notice
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
even
when
their
eye
have
meet
,
and
her
sister
have
approach
the
bed
,
Louisa
lie
for
minute
look
at
her
in
silence
,
and
suffer
her
timidly
to
hold
her
passive
hand
,
before
she
ask
:
   
"
<EOS>
when
be
I
bring
to
this
room
?
<EOS>

last
night
,
Louisa

"
   
<EOS>
"
who
bring
me
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sissy

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
believe
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
because
I
find
her
here
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
come
to
my
bedside
to
wake
me
,
as
she
always
do
;
and
I
go
to
look
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
her
own
room
either
;
and
I
go
look
for
her
all
over
the
house
,
until
I
find
her
here
take
care
of
you
and
cool
your
head
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
see
father
?
<EOS>
Sissy
say
I
be
to
tell
him
when
you
wake
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
a
beam
face
you
have

Jane
!
"
say
Louisa
,
as
her
young
sister
---
timidly
still
---
bent
down
to
kiss
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
have
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
you
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
must
be
Sissy

<EOS>

arm
Louisa
have
begin
to
twine
around
her
neck
,
unbend
itself
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
tell
father
if
you
will
.
"
 
then
,
stay
her
for
a
moment
,
she
say
,
"
It
be
you
who
make
my
room
so
cheerful
,
and
give
it
this
look
of
welcome
?

"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
no

Louisa

do
before
I

<EOS>
It

Louisa
turn
upon
her
pillow
,
and
hear
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
when
her
sister
have
withdraw
,
she
turn
her
head
back
again
,
and
lie
with
her
face
towards
the
door
,
until
it
open
and
her
father
enter
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
a
jade
anxious
look
upon
him
,
and
his
hand
,
usually
steady
,
tremble
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
down
at
the
side
of
the
bed
,
tenderly
ask
how
she
be
,
and
dwell
on
the
necessity
of
her
keep
very
quiet
after
her
agitation
and
exposure
to
the
weather
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
in
a
subdued
and
troubled
voice
,
very
different
from
his
usual
dictatorial
manner
;
and
be
often
at
a
loss
for
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

He

much
at

so
difficult
to
get
over

<EOS>
"
It
would
be
hopeless
for
me
,
Louisa
,
to
endeavour
to
tell
you
how
overwhelmed
I
have
be
,
and
still
be
,
by
what
break
upon
me
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
ground
on
which
I
stand
have
cease
to
be
solid
under
my
foot

<EOS>
the
only
support
on
which
I
lean
,
and
the
strength
of
which
it
seem
,

still
do
seem

impossible
to
question

have
give
way
in
an
instant

<EOS>
I
be
stun
by
these
discovery

<EOS>
I
have
no
selfish
meaning
in
what
I
say
;
but
I
find
the
shock
of
what
break
upon
me
last
night
,
to
be
very
heavy
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
could
give
him
no
comfort
herein
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
suffer
the
wreck
of
her
whole
life
upon
the
rock
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
,
Louisa
,
that
if
you
have
by
any
happy
chance
undeceive
me
some
time
ago
,
it
would
have
be
well
for
us
both
;
well
for
your
peace
,
and
well
for
mine
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
sensible
that
it
may
not
have
be
a
part
of
my
system
to
invite
any
confidence
of
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
prove
my
---
my
system
to
myself
,
and
I
have
rigidly
administer
it
;
and
I
must
bear
the
responsibility
of
its
failure
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
entreat
you
to
believe
,
my
favourite
child

that
I
have
mean
to
do
right

<EOS>
He
say
it
earnestly
,
and
to
do
him
justice
he
have
.
 
<EOS>
in
gauge
fathomless
deep
with
his
little
mean
excise
-
rod
,
and
in
staggering
over
the
universe
with
his
rusty
stiff
-
legged
compass
,
he
have
mean
to
do
great
thing
.
 
<EOS>
within
the
limit
of
his
short
tether
he
have
tumble
about
,
annihilate
the
flower
of
existence
with
great
singleness
of
purpose
than
many
of
the
blatant
personage
whose
company
he
keep

I
be
well
assured

outstretched

My
dear
,
I
have
remain
all
night
at
my
table

ponder
again

again
on
what
have
so
painfully
pass
between

I
consider
your

when
I

for
hour

have
be
conceal
by
you
for
year
;
when
I
consider
under
what
immediate
pressure
it
have
be
force
from
you
at
last
;
I
come
to
the
conclusion
<EOS>
that
I
can
not
but
mistrust
myself

<EOS>
He
may
have
add
more
than
all
,
when
he
see
the
face
now

at
him

<EOS>
He
do
add
it
in
effect
,
perhaps
,
as
he
softly
move
her
scattered
hair
from
her
forehead
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
such
little
action
,
slight
in
another
man

very
noticeable
in
him

his
daughter
receive
them
as
if
they
have
be
word
of
contrition

Mr
Gradgrind
,
slowly
,
and
with
hesitation
,
as
well
as
with
a
wretched
sense
of
happiness

if
I
see
reason
to
mistrust
myself
for
the
past

Louisa

I
should
also
mistrust
myself

speak
unreservedly
to
you

I
do

<EOS>
I
be
far
from

convinced
now

differently
I
may
have
feel
only
this
time
yesterday

that
I
be
fit
for
the
trust

repose
in
me
;
that
I
know
how
to
respond
to
the
appeal
you
have
come
home
to
make
to
me
;
that
I
have
the
right
instinct

it
for
the
moment
to
be
some
quality
of
that
nature

to
help
you

set
you
right

have
turn
upon

pillow

lie
with
her
face
upon

arm

could
not

her
wildness

venture
this

about

mere
love

gratitude

that

undone

do
silently

once
more

cast
away
there

go
out

have
not

anger

that
the
involuntary
look
she

come
to
this
fulfilment

unwholesome
fire

curse
these
quick
retort
of
the
young

be
so
true

a

Mr

disembarrass
himself
of

interview

the
small
conceivable
amount

and
debate
for
the
hundredth
time
what
all
this
could
mean
?
 
<EOS>
He
make
only
one
thing
clear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
that
whether
she
be
in
town
or
out
of
town
,
whether
he
have
be
premature
with
her
who
be
so
hard
to
comprehend
,
or
she
have
lose
courage
,
or
they
be
discover
,
or
some
mischance
or
mistake
,
at
present
incomprehensible
,
<EOS>
have
occur
,
he
must
remain
to
confront
his
fortune
,
whatever
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
hotel
where
he
be
know
to
live
when
condemn
to
that
region
of
blackness

be
the
stake
to
which
he
be
tie

<EOS>
as
to
all
the
rest
---
what
will
be

will
be

"
<EOS>
so
,
whether
I
be
wait
for
a
hostile
message
,
or
an
assignation
,
or
a
penitent
remonstrance
,
or
an
impromptu
wrestle
with
my
friend
Bounderby
in
the
Lancashire
manner
---
which
would
seem
as
likely
as
anything
else
in
the
present
state
of
affair
---
I
will
dine
,
"
say
Mr
James
Harthouse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
have
the
advantage
in
point
of
weight
;
and
if
anything
of
a
british
nature
be
to
come
off
between
us
,
it
may
be
as
well
to
be
in
training
.
"
   
<EOS>
therefore
he
ring
the
bell
,
and
toss
himself
negligently
on
a
sofa
,
order
"
some
dinner
at
six
---
with
a
beefsteak
in
it
,
"
and
get
through
the
intervene
time
as
well
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
particularly
well
;
for
he
remain
in
the
great
perplexity
,
and
,
as
the
hour
go
on
,
and
no
kind
of
explanation
offer
itself
,
his
perplexity
augment
at
compound
interest
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
he
take
affair
as
coolly
as
it
be
in
human
nature
to
do
,
and
entertain
himself
with
the
facetious
idea
of
the
training
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
be
bad
,
"
he
yawn
at
one
time
,
"
to
give
the
waiter
five
shilling
,
and
throw
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
another
time
it
occur
to
him
,
"
or
a
fellow
of
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
stone
may
be
hire
by
the
hour
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
these
jest
do
not
tell
materially
on
the
afternoon
,
or
his
suspense
;
and
,
sooth
to
say
,
they
both
lag
fearfully
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
,
even
before
dinner
,
to
avoid
often
walk
about
in
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
,
look
out
of
the
window
,
listen
at
the
door
for
footstep
,
and
occasionally
become
rather
hot
when
any
step
approach
that
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
after
dinner
,
when
the
day
turn
to
twilight
,
and
the
twilight
turn
to
night
,
and
still
no
communication
be
make
to
him

begin
to
be
as
he
express
it
,
"
like
the
Holy
Office

slow
torture

<EOS>
however
,
still
true
to
his
conviction
that
indifference
be
the
genuine
high
-
breeding
(
the
only
conviction
he
have
)
,
he
seize
this
crisis
as
the
opportunity
for
order
candle

a
newspaper

<EOS>
He
have
be
try
in

,
for
half
an
hour

to
read
this
newspaper

when

appear

at
once
mysteriously

apologetically

general
recollection
that
this

thing
the
Police
say
to
the
swell
mob

Mr

ask

that

of
those
pious
person
who
do
penance
for
their

---
it
be
customary
for
those
who
now
and

thirst
for
a
draught
of
pure
air
,
which
be
not
absolutely
the
most
wicked
among
the
vanity
of
life
,
to
get
a
few
mile
away
by
the
railroad

and
then
begin
their
walk

They

they

the

there

a
deep

when

a
great

<EOS>
They
all
consult
together
,
and
look
anxiously
at
the
surgeon
,
as
he
ask
some
question
,
and
shake
his
head
on

the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun

set
now
;
and
the
red
light
in
the
evening
sky
touch
every
face
there
,
and
cause
it
to
be
distinctly
see
in
all
its
rapt
suspense

<EOS>
the
consultation
end
in
the
man

to
the
windlass
,
and
the
pitman
go
down
again
,
carry
the
wine
and
some
other
small
matter
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
other
man
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
under
the
surgeon
's
direction
,
some
man
bring
a
hurdle
,
on
which
other
make
a
thick
bed
of
spare
clothe
cover
with
loose
straw
,
while
he
himself
contrive
some
bandage
and
sling
from
shawl
and
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
as
these
be
make
,
they
be
hang
upon
an
arm
of
the
pitman
who
have
last
come
up
,
with
instruction
how
to
use
them
:
and
as
he
stand
,
show
by
the
light
he
carry
,
lean
his
powerful
loose
hand
upon
one
of
the
pole
,
and
sometimes
glance
down
the
pit
,
and
sometimes
glance
round
upon
the
people
,
he
be
not
the
least
conspicuous
figure
in
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dark
now
,
and
torch
be
kindle
.
   
<EOS>
It
appear
from
the
little
this
man
say
to
those
about
him
,
which
be
quickly
repeat
all
over
the
circle
,
that
the
lost
man
have
fall
upon
a
mass
of
crumble
rubbish
with
which
the
pit
be
half
choke
up
,
and
that
his
fall
have
be
further
break
by
some
jagged
earth
at
the
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
lie
upon
his
back
with
one
arm
double
under
him
,
and
accord
to
his
own
belief
have
hardly
stir
since
he
fall
,
except
that
he
have
move
his
free
hand
to
a
side
pocket
,
in
which
he
remember
to
have
some
bread
and
meat
(
of
which
he
have
swallow
crumb
)
,
and
have
likewise
scoop
up
a
little
water
in
it
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
come
straight
away
from
his
work
,
on
be
write
to
,
and
have
walk
the
whole
journey
;
and
be
on
his
way
to
Mr
Bounderby
's
country
house
after
dark
,
when
he
fall
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
cross
that
dangerous
country
at
such
a
dangerous
time
,
because
he
be
innocent
of
what
be
lay
to
his
charge
,
and
could
not
rest
from
come
the
near
way
to
deliver
himself
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
the
pitman
say
,
with
a
curse
upon
it
,
be
worthy
of
its
bad
name
to
the
last
;
for
though
Stephen
could
speak
now
,
he
believe
it
would
soon
be
find
to
have
mangle
the
life
out
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
when
all
be
ready
,
this
man
,
still
take
his
last
hurried
charge
from
his
comrade
and
the
surgeon
after
the
windlass
have
begin
to
lower
him
,
disappear
into
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
the
rope
go
out
as
before

the
signal
be

as
before

and
the
windlass

<EOS>
no

his

from

now

<EOS>
every
one
wait
with
his
grasp
set
,
and
his
body
bend
down
to
the
work
,
ready
to
reverse

wind
in

<EOS>
at
length
the
signal
be
give
,
and
all
the
ring
lean
forward
.
   
<EOS>
for
,
now
,
the
rope

in

tighten
and
strain
to
its
utmost
as
it
appear
,
and
the
man
turn
heavily
,
and
the
windlass
complain
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
endurable
to
look
at
the
rope
,
and
think
of
its
give
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
ring
after
ring
be

finally
the
bucket
with
the
two

on
at

a
sight
to
make
the

swim
,
and
oppress
the

and
tenderly
support
between
them
,
slung
and
tie
within
,
the
figure
of
a
poor

crushed
,
human
creature

<EOS>
a
low
murmur
of
pity
go
round
the
throng
,
and
the
woman
weep
aloud
,
as
this
form
,
almost
without

very
slowly
from
its
iron
deliverance
,
and
lay
upon

of
straw

<EOS>
at
first

close
to
it

<EOS>
He
do
what
he
could
in
its
adjustment
on

the
good
that
he
could
do
be
to
cover
it

<EOS>
that
gently

Mr

and
his

have
not

near
Louisa
,
who
hold
her
father
's

<EOS>
without

his

he
confer
with
her
a

moment
,
and
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
thus
the
whelp
have
go
out
of
the
circle
before
the
people
move

<EOS>
when
the
father
reach
home

he
send
a
message
to
Mr
Bounderby
's

desire
his

<EOS>
the
reply

that
Mr

miss
him
in
the
crowd
,
and
see
nothing
of

<EOS>
"

say
Louisa

"
he
will
not

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
turn
away
,
and
say
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
he
go
down
to
the
Bank
himself
as
soon
as
it
be
open
,
and
see
his
son
's
place
empty
(
he
have
not
the
courage
to
look
in
at
first
)
go
back
along
the
street
to
meet
Mr
Bounderby
on
his
way
there
.
 
<EOS>
to
whom
he
say
that
,
for
reason
he
would
soon
explain
,
but
entreat
not
then
to
be
ask
for
,
he
have
find
it
necessary
to
employ
his
son
at
a
distance
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
also
,
that
he
be
charge
with
the
duty
of
vindicate
Stephen
Blackpool
's
memory
,
and
declare
the
thief
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
quite
confound
,
stand
stock
-
still
in
the
street
after
his
father
-
in
-
law
have
leave
him
,
swell
like
an
immense
soap
-
bubble
,
without
its
beauty
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
go
home
,
lock
himself
in
his
room
,
and
keep
it
all
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
when
Sissy
and
Louisa
tap
at
his
door
,
he
say
,
without
open
it
,
"
not
now
,
my
dear
;
in
the
evening
.
"
 
<EOS>
on
their
return
in
the
evening
,
he
say
,
"
I
be
not
able
yet
---
to
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
He
eat
nothing
all
day
,
and
have
no
candle
after
dark
;
and
they
hear
him
walk
to
and
fro
late
at
night
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
morning
he
appear
at
breakfast
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
take
his
usual
place
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
aged
and
bent
he
look
,
and
quite
bow
down
;
and
yet
he
look
a
wise
man
,
and
a
well
man
,
than
in
the
day
when
in
this
life
he
want
nothing
---
but
fact
.
<EOS>
before
he
leave
the
room
,
he
appoint
a
time
for
them
to
come
to
him
;
and
so
,
with
his
gray
head
drooping
,
go
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
father
,
"
say
Louisa
,
when
they
keep
their
appointment
,
"
you
have
three
young
child
leave
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
be
different
<EOS>
,
I
will
be
different
yet
,
with
Heaven
's
help
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
give
her
hand
to
Sissy
,
as
if
she
mean
with
her
help
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
wretched
brother
,
"
say
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
he
have
plan
this
robbery
,
when
he
go
with
you
to
the
lodging
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
so
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
have
want
money
very
much
,
and
have
spend
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
poor
man
be
about
to
leave
the
town
,
it
come
into
his
evil
brain
to
cast
suspicion
on
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
have
flash
upon
him
while
he
sit
there
,
father
.
<EOS>
for
I
ask
him
to
go
there
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
visit
do
not
originate
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
have
some
conversation
with
the
poor
man
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
take
him
aside
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
take
him
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
afterwards
,
why
he
have
do
so
,
and
he
make
a
plausible
excuse
;
but
since
last
night
,
father
,
and
when
I
remember
the
circumstance
by
its
light
,
I
be
afraid
I
can
imagine
too
truly
what
pass
between
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
let
me
know
,
"
say
her
father
,
"
if
your
thought
present
your
guilty
brother
in
the
same
dark
view
as
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
father
,
"
hesitate
Louisa
,
"
that
he
must
have
make
some
representation
to
Stephen
Blackpool
---
perhaps
in
my
name
,
perhaps
in
his
own
---
which
induce
him
to
do
in
good
faith
and
honesty
,
what
he
have
never
do
before
,
and
to
wait
about
the
Bank
those
two
or
three
night
before
he
leave
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
too
plain
!
"
return
the
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
too
plain
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
shade
his
face
,
and
remain
silent
for
some
moment
.
<EOS>
recover
himself
,
he
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
how
be
he
to
be
find
?
 
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
be
save
from
justice
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
few
hour
that
I
can
possibly
allow
to
elapse
before
I
publish
the
truth
,
how
be
he
to
be
find
by
us
,
and
only
by
us
?
 
<EOS>
ten
thousand
pound
could
not
effect
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sissy
have
effect
it
,
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
raise
his
eye
to
where
she
stand
,
like
a
good
fairy
in
his
house
,
and
say
in
a
tone
of
softened
gratitude
and
grateful
kindness
,
"
It
be
always
you
,
my
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
our
fear
,
"
Sissy
explain
,
glance
at
Louisa
,
"
before
yesterday
;
and
when
I
see
you
bring
to
the
side
of
the
litter
last
night
,
and
hear
what
pass
(
be
close
to
Rachael
all
the
time
)
,
I
go
to
him
when
no
one
see
,
and
say
to
him
,
"
do
not
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
see
where
your
father
be
.
 
<EOS>
escape
at
once
,
for
his
sake
and
your
own
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
tremble
before
I
whisper
to
him
,
and
he
start
and
tremble
more
then
,
and
say
,
"
where
can
I
go
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
money
,
and
I
do
not
know
who
will
hide
me
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
father
's
old
circus
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
forget
where
Mr
Sleary
go
at
this
time
of
year
,
and
I
read
of
him
in
a
paper
only
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
to
hurry
there
,
and
tell
his
name
,
and
ask
Mr
Sleary
to
hide
him
till
I
come
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
get
to
him
before
the
morning
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
see
him
shrink
away
among
the
people
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
be
get
abroad
yet
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
more
hopeful
as
the
town
to
which
Sissy
have
direct
him
be
within
three
hour
'
journey
of
Liverpool
,
whence
<EOS>
he
could
be
swiftly
dispatch
to
any
part
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
caution
be
necessary
in
communicate
with
him
---
for
there
be
a
great
danger
every
moment
of
his
be
suspect
now
,
and
nobody
could
be
sure
at
heart
but
that
Mr
Bounderby
himself
,
in
a
bully
vein
of
public
zeal
,
may
play
a
roman
part
<EOS>
---
it
be
consent
that
Sissy
and
Louisa
should
repair
to
the
place
in
question
,
by
a
circuitous
course
,
alone
;
and
that
the
unhappy
father
,
set
forth
in
an
opposite
direction
,
should
get
round
to
the
same
bourne
by
another
and
wide
route
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
further
agree
that
he
should
not
present
himself
to
Mr
Sleary
,
lest
his
intention
should
be
mistrust
,
or
the
intelligence
of
his
arrival
should
cause
his
son
to
take
flight
anew
;
but
,
that
the
communication
should
be
leave
to
Sissy
and
Louisa
to
open
;
and
that
they
should
inform
the
cause
of
so
much
misery
and
disgrace
,
of
his
father
's
be
at
hand
and
of
the
purpose
for
which
they
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
when
these
arrangement
have
be
well
consider
and
be
fully
understand
by
all
three
,
it
be
time
to
begin
to
carry
them
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
early
in
the
afternoon
,
Mr
Gradgrind
walk
direct
from
his
own
house
into
the
country
,
to
be
take
up
on
the
line
by
which
he
be
to
travel
;
and
at
night
the
remain
two
set
forth
upon
their
different
course
,
encourage
by
not
see
any
face
they
know
.
   
<EOS>
the
two
travel
all
night
,
except
when
they
be
leave
,
for
odd
number
of
minute
,
at
branch
-
place
,
up
illimitable
flight
of
step
,
or
down
well
---
which
be
the
only
variety
of
those
branch
---
and
,
early
in
the
morning
,
be
turn
out
on
a
swamp
,
a
mile
or
two
from
the
town
they
seek
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
dismal
spot
they
be
rescue
by
a
savage
old
postilion
,
who
happen
to
be
up
early
,
kick
a
horse
in
a
fly
:
 
and
so
be
smuggle
into
the
town
by
all
the
back
lane
where
the
pig
live
:
 
which
,
although
not
a
magnificent
or
even
savoury
approach
,
be
,
as
be
usual
in
such
case
,
the
legitimate
highway
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
thing
they
see
on
enter
the
town
be
the
skeleton
of
Sleary
's
Circus
.
 
<EOS>
the
company
have
depart
for
another
town
more
than
twenty
mile
off
,
and
have
open
there
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
connection
between
the
two
place
be
by
a
hilly
turnpike
-
road
,
and
the
travelling
on
that
road
be
very
slow
.
 
<EOS>
though
they
take
but
a
hasty
breakfast
,
and
no
rest
(
which
it
would
have
be
in
vain
to
seek
under
such
anxious
circumstance
)
,
it
be
noon
before
they
begin
to
find
the
bill
of
Sleary
's
Horse

and

and
one
o'clock

of

by
the
bellman
as
they
set
their
foot
upon
the
stone
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
recommend
that
,
to
avoid
make
inquiry
and
attract
attention
in
the
town
,
they
should
present
themselves
to
pay
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
if
Mr
Sleary
be
take
the
money
,
he
would
be
sure
to
know
her
,
and
would
proceed
with
discretion

<EOS>
if
he

he
would
be
sure
to
see
them
inside

and
,
know
what
he
have
do
with
the
fugitive
,
would
proceed
with
discretion
still
.
   
<EOS>
therefore
,
they
repair
,
with
flutter

,
to

"
if
that
portrait
could
speak
,
sir

but
it
have
the
advantage
over
the
original
of
not
possess
the
power
of
commit
itself

disgust

it

testify
,
that
a
long
period
have
elapse
since
I
first
habitually
address
it
as
the
picture

a
Noodle

<EOS>
nothing
that
a
noodle
do

can
awaken
surprise

indignation

the
proceeding

a
Noodle
can
only
inspire
contempt

"
   
<EOS>
thus
say
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
her
roman
feature
like
a
medal
strike
to
commemorate
her
scorn
of
Mr
Bounderby
,
survey
him
fixedly
from
head
to
foot
,
sweep
disdainfully
past
him
,
and
ascend
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
close
the
door
,
and
stand
before
the
fire
;
project
himself
after
his
old
explosive
manner
into
his
portrait
---
and
into
futurity
.
   
<EOS>
into
how
much
of
futurity
?
 
<EOS>
He
see
Mrs
Sparsit
fight
out
a
daily
fight
at
the
point
of
all
the
weapon
in
the
female
armoury
,
with
the
grudging
,
smart
,
peevish
,
torment
Lady
Scadgers
,
still
lay
up
in
bed
with
her
mysterious
leg
,
and
gobble
her
insufficient
income
down
by
about
the
middle
of
every
quarter
,
in
a
mean
little
airless
lodging
,
a
mere
closet
for
one
,
a
mere
crib
for
two
;
but
do
he
see
more
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
catch
any
glimpse
of
himself
make
a
show
of
Bitzer
to
stranger
,
as
the
rise
young
man
,
so
devoted
to
his
master
's
great
merit
,
who
have
win
young
Tom
's
place
,
and
have
almost
capture
young
Tom
himself
,
in
the
time
when
by
various
rascal
he
be
spirit
away
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
see
any
faint
reflection
of
his
own
image
make
a
vain
-
glorious
will
,
whereby
five
-
and
-
twenty
Humbugs
,
past
five
-
and
-
fifty
year
of
age
,
each
take
upon
himself
the
name
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
should
for
ever
dine
in
Bounderby
Hall
,
for
ever
lodge
in
Bounderby
building
,
for
ever
attend
a
Bounderby
chapel
,
for
ever
go
to
sleep
under
a
Bounderby
chaplain
,
for
ever
be
support
out
of
a

estate
,
and
for
ever
nauseate
all
healthy
stomach
,
with
a
vast
amount
of
Bounderby
balderdash
and
bluster
?
 
<EOS>
have
he
any
prescience
of
the
day
,
five
year
to
come
,
when
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
be
to
die
of
a
fit
in
the
Coketown
street
,
and
this
same
precious
will
be
to
begin
its
long
career
of
quibble
,
plunder
,
false
pretence
,
vile
example
,
little
service
and
much
law
?
<EOS>
probably
not
.
 
<EOS>
yet
the
portrait
be
to
see
it
all
out
.
   
<EOS>
here
be
Mr
Gradgrind
on
the
same
day
,
and
in
the
same
hour
,
sit
thoughtful
in
his
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
how
much
of
futurity
do
he
see
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
see
himself
,
a
white
-
haired
decrepit
man
,
bend
his
hitherto
inflexible
theory
to
appoint
circumstance
;
make
his
fact
and
figure
subservient
to
Faith
,
Hope
,
and
Charity
;
and
no
longer
try
to
grind
that
heavenly
trio
in
his
dusty
little
mill
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
catch
sight
of
himself
,
therefore
much
despise
by
his
late
political
associate
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
see
them
,
in
the
era
of
its
be
quite
settle
that
the
national
dustman
have
only
to
do
with
one
another
,
and
owe
no
duty
to
an
abstraction
call
a
People
,
"
taunt
the
honourable
gentleman
"
with
this
and
with
that
and
with
what
not
,
five
night
a
-
week
,
until
the
small
hour
of
the
morning
?
 
<EOS>
probably
he
have
that
much
foreknowledge
,
know
his
man
.
   
<EOS>
here
be
Louisa
on
the
night
of
the
same
day
,
watch
the
fire
as
in
day
of
yore
,
though
with
a
gentle
and
a
humbler
face
.
 
<EOS>
how
much
of
the
future
may
arise
before
her
vision
?
 
<EOS>
broadside
in
the
street
,
sign
with
her
father
's
name
,
exonerate
the
late
Stephen
Blackpool
,
weaver
,
from
misplaced
suspicion
,
and
publish
the
guilt
of
his
own
son
,
with
such
extenuation
as
his
year
and
temptation
<EOS>
(
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
add
,
his
education
)
may
beseech

be
of
the
Present

ringing
of
the
Factory
bell
,
and
pass
to

fro
at
the
set
hour
,
among
the
Coketown
Hands
;
a
woman
of
pensive
beauty
,
always
dress
in
black
,
but
sweet
-
tempered
and
serene
,
and
even
cheerful
;
who
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
place
,
alone
appear
to
have
compassion
on
a
degraded
,
drunken
wretch
of
her
own
sex
,
who
be
sometimes

in
the
town
secretly
beg
of

and

but
content
to
do
it
,
and
prefer
to
do
it
as
her
natural
lot

should
be
too
old
to
labour
any
more
?
 
<EOS>
do

this
?
 
<EOS>
such
a

that

and
that
all
the
treasure
in

childhood
of

<EOS>
no

childhood
of
the
body
,

even
a
more
beautiful
thing
,
and
a

with
those

,
without
which
the
heart
of
infancy

wither
up
,
the
