   
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
have
great
trouble
,
and
some
comfort
,
to
acquaint
you
with
.
 
<EOS>
the
trouble
be
,
that
my
good
lady
die
of
the
illness
I
mention
to
you
,
and
leave
us
all
much
grieve
for
the
loss
of
her
;
for
she
be
a
dear
good
lady
,
and
kind
to
all
us
her
servant
.
 
<EOS>
much
I
fear
,
that
as
I
be
take
by
her
ladyship
to
wait
upon
her
person
,
I
should
be
quite
destitute
again
,
and
force
to
return
to
you
and
my
poor
mother
,
who
have
enough
to
do
to
maintain
yourself
;
and
,
as
my
lady
's
goodness
have
put
me
to
write
and
cast
account
,
and
make
me
a
little
expert
at
my
needle
,
and
otherwise
qualified
above
my
degree
,
it
be
not
every
family
that
could
have
find
a
place
that
your
poor
Pamela
be
fit
for
:
but
God
,
whose
graciousness
to
us
we
have
so
often
experience
at
a
pinch
,
put
it
into
my
good
lady
's
heart
,
on
her
death
-
bed
,
just
an
hour
before
she
expire
,
to
recommend
to
my
young
master
all
her
servant
,
one
by
one
;
and
when
it
come
to
my
turn
to
be
recommend
,
(
for
I
be
sob
and
cry
at
her
pillow
)
<EOS>
she
could
only
say
,
My
dear
son
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
break
off
a
little
;
and
then
recover
 
<EOS>
remember
my
poor
Pamela
 
<EOS>
and
these
be
some
of
her
last
word
!
 
<EOS>
o
how
my
eye
run
 
<EOS>
do
not
wonder
to
see
the
paper
so
blot
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
God
's
will
must
be
do
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
come
the
comfort
,
that
I
shall
not
be
oblige
to
return
back
to
be
a
clog
upon
my
dear
parent
!
<EOS>
for
my
master
say
,
I
will
take
care
of
you
all
,
my
good
maiden
;
and
for
you
,
Pamela
,
(
and
take
me
by
the
hand
;
yes
,
he
take
my
hand
before
them
all
,
)
for
my
dear
mother
's
sake
,
I
will
be
a
friend
to
you
,
and
you
shall
take
care
of
my
linen
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
and
pray
with
me
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
for
a
blessing
upon
him
,
for
he
have
give
mourning
and
a
year
's
wage
to
all
my
lady
's
servant
;
and
I
have
no
wage
as
yet
,
my
lady
have
say
she
should
do
for
me
as
I
deserve
,
order
the
housekeeper
to
give
me
mourn
with
the
rest
;
and
give
me
with
his
own
hand
four
golden
guinea
,
and
some
silver
,
which
be
in
my
old
lady
's
pocket
when
she
die
;
and
say
,
if
I
be
a
good
girl
,
and
faithful
and
diligent
,
he
would
be
a
friend
to
me
,
for
his
mother
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
send
you
these
four
guinea
for
your
comfort
;
for
Providence
will
not
let
me
want
:
<EOS>
and
so
you
may
pay
some
old
debt
with
part
,
and
keep
the
other
part
to
comfort
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
get
more
,
I
be
sure
it
be
my
duty
,
and
it
shall
be
my
care
,
to
love
and
cherish
you
both
;
for
you
have
love
and
cherish
me
,
when
I
could
do
nothing
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
send
them
by
John
,
our
footman
,
who
go
your
way
:
but
he
do
not
know
what
he
carry
;
because
I
seal
them
up
in
one
of
the
little
pill
-
box
,
which
my
lady
have
,
wrapt
close
in
paper
,
that
they
may
not
chink
;
and
be
sure
do
not
open
it
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
must
give
you
both
grief
and
pleasure
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
will
only
say
,
pray
for
your
Pamela
;
who
will
ever
be
                                          
Your
most
dutiful
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
scare
out
of
my
sense
;
for
just
now
,
as
I
be
fold
up
this
letter
in
my
late
lady
's
dressing
-
room
,
in
come
my
young
master
!
<EOS>
good
sir
!
<EOS>
how
be
I
frighten
!
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
hide
the
letter
in
my
bosom
;
and
he
,
see
me
tremble
,
say
,
smile
,
to
whom
have
you
be
write
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
in
my
confusion
,
pray
your
honour
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
only
to
my
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
well
then
,
let
me
see
how
you
be
come
on
in
your
writing
!
 
<EOS>
o
how
ashamed
I
be
!
 
<EOS>
He
take
it
,
without
say
more
,
and
read
it
quite
through
,
and
then
give
it
me
again
;
 
and
<EOS>
I
say
,
pray
your
honour
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
yet
I
know
not
for
what
:
for
he
be
always
dutiful
to
his
parent
;
and
why
should
he
be
angry
that
I
be
so
to
mine
?
<EOS>
and
indeed
he
be
not
angry
;
for
he
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
You
be
a
good
girl
,
Pamela
,
to
be
kind
to
your
aged
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
angry
with
you
for
write
such
innocent
matter
as
these
:
though
you
ought
to
be
wary
<EOS>
what
tale
you
send
out
of
a
family
.
 
<EOS>
be
faithful
and
diligent
;
and
do
as
you
should
do
,
and
I
like
you
the
well
for
this
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
say
,
why
,
Pamela
,
you
write
a
very
pretty
hand
,
and
spell
tolerably
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
my
good
mother
's
care
in
your
learning
have
not
be
throw
away
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
use
to
say
you
love
reading
;
you
may
look
into
any
of
her
book
,
to
improve
yourself
,
so
you
take
care
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
do
nothing
but
courtesy
and
cry
,
and
be
all
in
confusion
,
at
his
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
the
good
of
gentleman
,
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
make
another
long
letter
:
<EOS>
so
will
only
add
to
it
,
that
I
shall
ever
be
Your
dutiful
daughter
,
                  
PAMELA
ANDREWS
.
    
<EOS>
[
in
answer
to
the
precede
.
]
  
<EOS>
dear
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
Your
letter
be
indeed
a
great
trouble
,
and
some
comfort
,
to
me
and
your
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
trouble
,
to
be
sure
,
for
your
good
lady
's
death
,
who
take
such
care
of
you
,
and
give
you
learn
,
and
,
for
three
or
four
year
past
,
have
always
be
give
you
clothe
and
linen
,
and
every
thing
that
a
gentlewoman
nee
not
be
ashamed
to
appear
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
our
chief
trouble
be
,
and
indeed
a
very
great
one
,
<EOS>
for
fear
you
should
be
bring
to
anything
dishonest
or
wicked
,
by
be
set
so
above
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
every
body
talk
how
you
have
come
on
,
and
what
a
genteel
girl
you
be
;
and
some
say
you
be
very
pretty
;
and
,
indeed
,
six
month
since
,
when
I
see
you
last
,
I
should
have
think
so
myself
,
if
you
be
not
our
child
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
avail
all
this
,
if
you
be
to
be
ruin
and
undone
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
we
begin
to
be
in
great
fear
for
you
;
for
what
signify
all
the
rich
in
the
world
,
with
a
bad
conscience
,
and
to
be
dishonest
!
 
<EOS>
We
be
,
'
tis
true
,
very
poor
,
and
find
it
hard
enough
to
live
;
though
once
,
as
you
know
,
it
be
well
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
would
sooner
live
upon
the
water
,
and
,
if
possible
,
the
clay
of
the
ditch
I
contentedly
dig
,
than
live
better
at
the
price
of
our
child
's
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
the
good
'
squire
have
no
design
:
but
when
he
have
give
you
so
much
money
,
and
speak
so
kindly
to
you
,
and
praise
your
come
on
;
and
,
oh
,
that
fatal
word
!
<EOS>
that
he
would
be
kind
to
you
,
if
you
would
do
as
you
should
do
,
almost
kill
us
with
fear
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
speak
to
good
old
widow
Mumford
about
it
,
who
,
you
know
,
have
formerly
live
in
good
family
;
and
she
put
us
in
some
comfort
;
for
she
say
it
be
not
unusual
,
when
a
lady
die
,
to
give
what
she
have
about
her
person
to
her
waiting
-
maid
,
and
to
such
as
sit
up
with
her
in
her
illness
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
then
,
why
should
he
smile
so
kindly
upon
you
?
 
<EOS>
why
should
he
take
such
a
poor
girl
as
you
by
the
hand
,
as
your
letter
say
he
have
do
twice
?
 
<EOS>
why
should
he
stoop
to
read
your
letter
to
us
;
and
commend
your
writing
and
spelling
?
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
he
give
you
leave
to
read
his
mother
's
book
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
indeed
,
my
dear
child
,
our
heart
ache
for
you
;
and
then
you
seem
so
full
of
joy
at
his
goodness
,
so
take
with
his
kind
expression
,
(
which
,
truly
,
be
very
great
favour
,
if
he
mean
well
)
that
we
fear
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear
child
,
we
fear
 
you
should
be
too
grateful
,
 
and
reward
him
with
that
jewel
,
your
virtue
,
which
no
riches
,
nor
favour
,
nor
any
thing
in
this
life
,
can
make
up
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
have
write
a
long
letter
,
but
will
say
one
thing
more
;
and
that
is
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
our
poverty
and
misfortune
,
we
have
trust
in
God
's
goodness
,
and
be
honest
,
and
doubt
not
to
be
happy
hereafter
,
if
we
continue
to
be
good
,
though
our
lot
be
hard
here
;
but
the
loss
of
our
dear
child
's
virtue
would
be
a
grief
that
we
could
not
bear
,
and
would
bring
our
grey
hair
to
the
grave
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
then
,
you
love
us
,
if
you
wish
for
God
's
blessing
,
and
your
own
future
happiness
,
we
both
charge
you
to
stand
upon
your
guard
:
<EOS>
and
,
if
you
find
the
least
attempt
make
upon
your
virtue
,
be
sure
you
leave
every
thing
behind
you
,
and
come
away
to
us
;
for
we
have
rather
see
you
all
cover
with
rag
,
and
even
follow
you
to
the
churchyard
,
than
have
it
say
,
a
child
of
our
prefer
any
worldly
convenience
to
her
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
We
accept
kindly
your
dutiful
present
;
but
,
till
we
be
out
of
pain
,
can
not
make
use
of
it
,
for
fear
we
should
partake
of
the
price
of
our
poor
daughter
's
shame
:
so
have
lay
it
up
in
a
rag
among
the
thatch
,
over
the
window
,
for
a
while
,
lest
we
should
be
rob
.
 
<EOS>
with
our
blessing
,
and
our
hearty
prayer
for
you
,
we
remain
,
            
Your
careful
,
but
love
Father
and
Mother
,

and
ELIZABETH
ANDREWS

<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
,
your
letter
have
fill
me
with
trouble
,
for
it
have
make
my
heart
,
which
be
overflow
with
gratitude
for
my
master
's
goodness
,
suspicious
and
fearful
:
<EOS>
and
yet
I
hope
I
shall
never
find
him
to
act
unworthy
of
his
character
;
for
what
could
he
get
by
ruin
such
a
poor
young
creature
as
me
?
 
<EOS>
but
that
which
give
me
most
trouble
be
,
that
you
seem
to
mistrust
the
honesty
of
your
child
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
be
assure
,
that
,
by
God
's
grace
,
I
never
will
do
any
thing
that
shall
bring
your
grey
hair
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
die
a
thousand
death
,
rather
than
be
dishonest
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
of
that
be
assure
,
and
set
your
heart
at
rest
;
for
although
I
have
live
above
myself
for
some
time
past
,
yet
I
can
be
content
with
rag
and
poverty
,
and
bread
and
water
,
and
will
embrace
them
,
rather
than
forfeit
<EOS>
my
good
name
,
let
who
will
be
the
tempter
.
 
<EOS>
and
of
this
pray
rest
satisfied
,
and
think
better
of
                             
Your
dutiful
daughter
till
death
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
continue
to
be
very
affable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
yet
I
see
no
cause
to
fear
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
the
housekeeper
,
too
,
be
very
civil
to
me
,
and
I
have
the
love
of
every
body
.
 
<EOS>
sure
they
can
not
all
have
design
against
me
,
because
they
be
civil
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
always
behave
so
as
to
be
respect
by
every
one
;
and
that
nobody
would
do
me
more
hurt
than
I
be
sure
I
would
do
them
.
 
<EOS>
Our
John
so
often
go
your
way
,
that
I
will
always
get
him
to
call
,
that
you
may
hear
from
me
,
either
by
write
,
(
for
it
bring
my
hand
in
,
)
or
by
word
of
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
dear
MOTHER
,
  
for
the
last
be
to
my
father
,
in
answer
to
his
letter
;
and
so
I
will
now
write
to
you
;
though
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
what
will
make
me
look
more
like
a
vain
hussy
,
than
any
thing
else
:
<EOS>
however
,
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
so
proud
as
to
forget
myself
.
 
<EOS>
yet
there
be
a
secret
pleasure
one
have
to
hear
one
's
self
praise
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
then
,
that
my
Lady
Davers
,
who
,
I
need
not
tell
you
,
be
my
master
's
sister
,
have
be
a
month
at
our
house
,
and
have
take
great
notice
of
me
,
and
give
me
good
advice
to
keep
myself
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
I
be
a
pretty
wench
,
and
that
every
body
give
me
a
very
good
character
,
and
love
me
;
and
bid
me
take
care
to
keep
the
fellow
at
a
distance
;
and
say
,
that
I
may
do
,
and
be
more
value
for
it
,
even
by
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
please
me
much
be
,
what
I
be
go
to
tell
you
;
for
at
table
,
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Jervis
say
,
my
master
and
her
ladyship
talk
of
me
,
she
tell
him
she
think
me
the
pretty
wench
<EOS>
she
ever
see
in
her
life
;
and
that
I
be
too
pretty
to
live
in
a
bachelor
's
house
;
since
no
lady
he
may
marry
would
care
to
continue
me
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
be
vastly
improve
,
and
have
a
good
share
of
prudence
,
and
sense
above
my
year
;
and
that
it
would
be
pity
,
that
what
be
my
merit
should
be
my
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
no
,
say
my
good
lady
,
Pamela
shall
come
and
live
with
me
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
with
all
his
heart
;
he
should
be
glad
to
have
me
so
well
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
I
will
consult
my
lord
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
how
old
I
be
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
say
,
I
be
fifteen
last
February
.
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
if
the
wench
(
for
so
she
call
all
us
maiden
servant
)
take
care
of
herself
,
she
will
improve
yet
more
and
more
,
as
well
in
her
person
as
mind
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
though
this
may
look
too
vain
to
be
repeat
by
me
;
yet
be
you
not
rejoice
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
I
,
to
see
my
master
so
willing
to
part
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
this
shew
that
he
have
nothing
bad
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
John
be
just
go
away
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
have
only
to
say
,
that
I
be
,
and
will
always
be
,
                         
Your
honest
as
well
as
dutiful
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
pray
make
use
of
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
now
do
it
safely
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
John
be
to
go
your
way
<EOS>
,
I
be
willing
to
write
,
because
he
be
so
willing
to
carry
any
thing
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
do
him
good
at
his
heart
to
see
you
both
,
and
to
hear
you
talk
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
you
be
both
so
sensible
,
and
so
honest
,
that
he
always
learn
something
from
you
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
thousand
pity
,
he
say
,
that
such
worthy
heart
should
not
have
well
luck
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
and
wonder
,
that
you
,
my
father
,
who
be
so
well
able
to
teach
,
and
write
so
good
a
hand
,
succeed
no
well
in
the
school
you
attempt
to
set
up
;
but
be
force
to
go
to
such
hard
labour
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
more
pride
to
me
,
that
I
be
come
of
such
honest
parent
,
than
if
I
have
be
bear
a
lady
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
yet
of
go
to
Lady
Davers
;
and
I
be
very
easy
at
present
here
:
for
Mrs.
Jervis
use
me
as
if
I
be
her
own
daughter
,
and
be
a
very
good
woman
,
and
make
my
master
's
interest
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
always
give
me
good
counsel
,
and
I
love
her
next
to
you
two
,
I
think
,
good
of
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
She
keep
so
good
rule
and
order
,
she
be
mightily
respect
by
us
all
;
and
take
delight
to
hear
me
read
to
her
;
and
all
she
love
to
hear
read
,
be
good
book
,
which
we
read
whenever
we
be
alone
;
so
that
I
think
I
be
at
home
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
hear
one
of
our
man
,
Harry
,
who
be
no
well
than
he
should
be
,
speak
freely
to
me
;
I
think
he
call
me
his
pretty
Pamela
,
and
take
hold
of
me
,
as
if
he
would
have
kiss
me
;
for
which
,
you
may
be
sure
,
I
be
very
angry
:
and
she
take
him
to
task
,
and
be
as
angry
at
him
as
could
be
;
and
tell
me
she
be
very
well
pleased
to
see
my
prudence
and
modesty
,
and
that
I
keep
all
the
fellow
at
a
distance
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
be
sure
I
be
not
proud
,
and
carry
it
civilly
to
every
body
;
<EOS>
but
yet
,
methink
,
I
can
not
bear
to
be
look
upon
by
these
man
-
servant
,
for
they
seem
as
if
they
would
look
one
through
;
and
,
as
I
generally
breakfast
,
dine
,
and
sup
,
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
(
so
good
she
be
to
me
,
)
<EOS>
I
be
very
easy
that
I
have
so
little
to
say
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
they
be
civil
to
me
in
the
main
,
for
Mrs.
Jervis
's
sake
,
who
they
see
love
me
;
and
they
stand
in
awe
of
her
,
know
her
to
be
a
gentlewoman
bear
,
though
she
have
have
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
on
again
with
a
long
letter
;
for
I
love
writing
,
and
shall
tire
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
I
begin
,
I
only
intend
to
say
,
that
I
be
quite
fearless
of
any
danger
now
:
and
,
indeed
,
can
not
but
wonder
at
myself
,
(
though
your
caution
to
me
be
your
watchful
love
,
)
<EOS>
that
I
should
be
so
foolish
as
to
be
so
uneasy
as
I
have
be
:
for
I
be
sure
my
master
would
not
demean
himself
,
so
as
to
think
upon
such
a
poor
girl
as
I
,
for
my
harm
.
 
<EOS>
for
such
a
thing
would
ruin
his
credit
,
as
well
as
mine
,
you
know
:
who
,
to
be
sure
,
may
expect
one
of
the
good
lady
in
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
so
no
more
at
present
,
but
that
I
be
                                           
Your
ever
dutiful
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
My
master
have
be
very
kind
since
my
last
;
for
he
have
give
me
a
suit
of
my
late
lady
's
clothe
,
and
half
a
dozen
of
her
shift
,
and
six
fine
handkerchief
,
and
three
of
her
cambric
apron
,
and
four
holland
one
.
<EOS>
the
clothe
be
fine
silk
,
and
too
rich
and
too
good
for
me
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
no
affront
to
him
to
make
money
of
them
,
and
send
it
to
you
:
it
would
do
me
more
good
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
be
full
of
fear
,
I
warrant
now
,
of
some
design
upon
me
,
till
I
tell
you
,
that
he
be
with
Mrs.
Jervis
when
he
give
them
me
;
and
he
give
her
a
mort
of
good
thing
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
bid
her
wear
them
in
remembrance
of
her
good
friend
,
my
lady
,
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
give
me
these
fine
thing
,
he
say
,
these
,
Pamela
,
be
for
you
;
have
them
make
fit
for
you
,
when
your
mourning
be
lay
by
,
and
wear
them
for
your
good
mistress
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
give
you
a
very
good
word
;
and
I
would
have
you
continue
to
behave
as
prudently
as
you
have
do
hitherto
,
and
every
body
will
be
your
friend
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
surprised
at
his
goodness
,
that
I
could
not
tell
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
courtesie
to
him
,
and
to
Mrs.
Jervis
for
her
good
word
;
and
say
,
I
wish
I
may
be
deserve
of
his
favour
,
and
her
kindness
:
<EOS>
and
nothing
should
be
want
in
me
,
to
the
good
of
my
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
amiable
a
thing
be
do
good
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
I
envy
great
folk
for
.
  
<EOS>
I
always
think
my
young
master
a
fine
gentleman
,
as
every
body
say
he
be
:
but
he
give
these
good
thing
to
us
both
with
such
a
graciousness
,
as
I
think
he
look
like
an
angel
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
say
,
he
ask
her
,
if
I
keep
the
man
at
a
distance
?
<EOS>
for
,
he
say
,
I
be
very
pretty
;
and
to
be
draw
in
to
have
any
of
them
,
may
be
my
ruin
,
and
make
me
poor
and
miserable
betime
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
be
want
to
give
me
a
good
word
,
and
take
occasion
to
lanch
out
in
my
praise
,
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
she
have
say
no
more
than
I
shall
try
to
deserve
,
though
I
may
not
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
will
always
love
her
,
next
to
you
and
my
dear
mother
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
rest
                                    
<EOS>
Your
ever
dutiful
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
,
  
<EOS>
since
my
last
,
my
master
give
me
more
fine
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
call
me
up
to
my
late
lady
's
closet
,
and
,
pull
out
her
drawer
,
he
give
me
two
suit
of
fine
Flanders
lace
headclothe
,
three
pair
of
fine
silk
shoe
,
two
hardly
the
bad
,
and
just
fit
for
me
,
(
for
my
lady
have
a
very
little
foot
,
)
and
the
other
with
work
silver
buckle
in
them
;
and
several
riband
and
top
-
knot
of
all
colour
;
four
pair
of
white
fine
cotton
stocking
,
and
three
pair
of
fine
silk
one
;
and
two
pair
of
rich
stay
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
astonished
,
and
unable
to
speak
for
a
while
;
but
yet
I
be
inwardly
ashamed
to
take
the
stocking
;
for
Mrs.
Jervis
be
not
there
:
if
she
have
,
it
would
have
be
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
receive
them
very
awkwardly
;
for
he
smile
at
my
awkwardness
,
and
say
,
do
not
blush
,
<EOS>
Pamela
:
<EOS>
dost
think
I
do
not
know
pretty
maid
should
wear
shoe
and
stocking
?
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
confound
at
these
word
,
you
may
have
beat
me
down
with
a
feather
.
 
<EOS>
for
you
must
think
,
there
be
no
answer
to
be
make
to
this
:
<EOS>
so
,
like
a
fool
,
I
be
ready
to
cry
;
and
go
away
courtesye
and
blushing
,
I
be
sure
,
up
to
the
ear
;
for
,
though
there
be
no
harm
in
what
he
say
,
yet
I
do
not
know
how
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
go
and
tell
all
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
say
,
God
put
it
into
his
heart
to
be
good
to
me
;
and
I
must
double
my
diligence
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
to
her
,
she
say
,
as
if
he
would
fit
me
in
dress
for
a
waiting
-
maid
's
place
on
Lady
Davers
's
own
person
.
  
<EOS>
but
still
your
kind
fatherly
caution
come
into
my
head
,
and
make
all
these
gift
nothing
near
to
me
what
they
would
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
I
hope
,
there
be
no
reason
;
for
what
good
could
it
do
to
him
to
harm
such
a
simple
maiden
as
me
?
 
<EOS>
besides
,
to
be
sure
no
lady
would
look
upon
him
,
if
he
should
so
disgrace
himself
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
make
myself
easy
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
should
never
have
be
otherwise
,
if
you
have
not
put
it
into
my
head
;
for
my
good
,
I
know
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
may
be
,
without
these
uneasiness
to
mingle
with
these
benefit
,
I
may
be
too
much
puff
up
:
<EOS>
so
I
will
conclude
,
all
that
happen
be
for
our
good
;
and
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
;
and
I
know
you
constantly
pray
for
a
blessing
upon
me
;
who
be
,
and
shall
always
be
,
                                    
Your
dutiful
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
dear
PAMELA
,
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
renew
my
caution
on
your
master
's
kindness
,
and
his
free
expression
to
you
about
the
stocking
.
 
<EOS>
yet
there
may
not
be
,
and
<EOS>
I
hope
there
be
not
,
any
thing
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
reflect
,
that
there
possibly
may
,
and
that
if
there
should
,
no
less
depend
upon
it
than
my
child
's
everlasting
happiness
in
this
world
and
the
next
;
it
be
enough
to
make
one
fearful
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
arm
yourself
,
my
dear
child
,
for
the
bad
;
and
resolve
to
lose
your
life
sooner
than
your
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
what
though
the
doubt
I
fill
you
with
,
lessen
the
pleasure
you
would
have
have
in
your
master
's
kindness
;
yet
what
signify
the
delight
that
arise
from
a
few
paltry
fine
clothe
,
in
comparison
with
a
good
conscience
?
  
<EOS>
these
be
,
indeed
,
very
great
favour
that
he
heap
upon
you
,
but
so
much
the
more
to
be
suspect
;
and
when
you
say
he
look
so
amiably
,
and
like
an
angel
,
how
afraid
I
be
,
that
they
should
make
too
great
an
impression
upon
you
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
though
you
be
bless
with
sense
and
prudence
above
your
year
,
yet
I
tremble
to
think
,
what
a
sad
hazard
a
poor
maiden
of
little
more
than
fifteen
year
of
age
stand
against
the
temptation
of
this
world
,
and
a
design
young
gentleman
,
if
he
should
prove
so
,
who
have
so
much
power
to
oblige
,
and
have
a
kind
of
authority
to
command
,
as
your
master
.
  
<EOS>
I
charge
you
,
my
dear
child
,
on
both
our
blessing
,
poor
as
we
be
,
to
be
on
your
guard
;
there
can
be
no
harm
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
and
since
Mrs.
Jervis
be
so
good
a
gentlewoman
,
and
so
kind
to
you
,
I
be
the
easy
a
great
deal
,
and
so
be
your
mother
;
and
we
hope
you
will
hide
nothing
from
her
,
and
take
her
counsel
in
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
with
our
blessing
,
and
assure
prayer
for
you
,
more
than
for
ourselves
,
we
remain
,
                                    
Your
love
FATHER
and
MOTHER
.
  
<EOS>
be
sure
do
not
let
people
's
tell
you
,
you
be
pretty
,
puff
you
up
;
for
you
do
not
make
yourself
,
and
so
can
have
no
praise
due
to
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
virtue
and
goodness
only
,
that
make
the
true
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
remember
that
,
Pamela
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
be
sorry
to
write
you
word
,
that
the
hope
I
have
of
go
to
wait
on
Lady
Davers
,
be
quite
over
.
 
<EOS>
My
lady
would
have
have
me
;
but
my
master
,
as
I
hear
by
the
by
,
would
not
consent
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
her
nephew
may
be
take
with
me
,
and
I
may
draw
him
in
,
or
be
draw
in
by
him
;
and
he
think
,
as
his
mother
love
me
,
and
commit
me
to
his
care
,
he
ought
to
continue
me
with
him
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
would
be
a
mother
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
tell
me
the
lady
shake
her
head
,
and
say
,
ah
!
brother
!
<EOS>
and
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
you
have
make
me
fearful
by
your
caution
,
my
heart
at
time
misgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
nothing
yet
of
your
caution
,
or
my
own
uneasiness
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
;
not
that
I
mistrust
her
,
but
for
fear
she
should
think
me
presumptuous
,
and
vain
and
conceited
,
to
have
any
fear
about
the
matter
,
from
the
great
distance
between
such
a
gentleman
,
and
so
poor
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
Mrs.
Jervis
seem
to
build
something
upon
Lady
Davers
's
shake
her
head
,
and
say
,
ah
!
brother
!
<EOS>
and
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
God
,
I
hope
,
will
give
me
his
grace
:
and
so
I
will
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
make
myself
too
uneasy
;
for
I
hope
there
be
no
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
but
every
little
matter
that
happen
,
I
will
acquaint
you
with
,
that
you
may
continue
to
me
your
good
advice
,
and
pray
for
                               
Your
sad
-
hearted
PAMELA
.
    
<EOS>
dear
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
You
and
my
good
father
may
wonder
you
have
not
have
a
letter
from
me
in
so
many
week
;
but
a
sad
,
sad
scene
,
have
be
the
occasion
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
to
be
sure
,
now
it
be
too
plain
,
that
all
your
caution
be
well
ground
.
 
<EOS>
o
my
dear
mother
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
miserable
,
truly
miserable
!
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
do
not
be
frightened
,
I
be
honest
!
 
<EOS>
God
,
of
his
goodness
,
keep
me
so
!
  
<EOS>
o
this
angel
of
a
master
!
<EOS>
this
fine
gentleman
!
<EOS>
this
gracious
benefactor
to
your
poor
Pamela
!
<EOS>
who
be
to
take
care
of
me
at
the
prayer
of
his
good
die
mother
;
who
be
so
apprehensive
for
me
,
lest
I
should
be
draw
in
by
Lord
Davers
's
nephew
,
that
he
would
not
let
me
go
to
Lady
Davers
's
:
<EOS>
this
very
gentleman
(
yes
,
I
must
call
him
gentleman
,
though
he
have
fall
from
the
merit
of
that
title
)
have
degrade
himself
to
offer
freedom
to
his
poor
servant
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
now
shew
himself
in
his
true
colour
;
and
,
to
me
,
nothing
appear
so
black
,
and
so
frightful
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
idle
;
but
have
writ
from
time
to
time
,
how
he
,
by
sly
mean
degree
,
expose
his
wicked
view
;
but
somebody
steal
my
letter
,
and
I
know
not
what
have
become
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
long
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
he
that
be
mean
enough
to
do
bad
thing
,
in
one
respect
,
do
not
stick
at
this
.
<EOS>
but
be
it
as
it
will
,
all
the
use
he
can
make
of
it
will
be
,
that
he
may
be
ashamed
of
his
part
;
<EOS>
I
not
of
mine
:
for
he
will
see
I
be
resolve
to
be
virtuous
,
and
glory
in
the
honesty
of
my
poor
parent
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
,
the
next
opportunity
;
for
I
be
watch
very
narrowly
;
and
he
say
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
this
girl
be
always
scribble
;
I
think
she
may
be
better
employ
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
work
all
hour
with
my
needle
,
upon
his
linen
,
and
the
fine
linen
of
the
family
;
and
be
,
besides
,
about
flower
him
a
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
but
<EOS>
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
heart
's
break
almost
;
for
what
be
I
likely
to
have
for
my
reward
,
but
shame
and
disgrace
,
or
else
ill
word
,
and
hard
treatment
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
soon
,
and
hope
I
shall
find
my
long
letter
.
                                       
<EOS>
Your
most
afflict
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
May
-
be
,
I
he
and
him
too
much
:
<EOS>
but
it
be
his
own
fault
if
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
for
why
do
he
lose
all
his
dignity
with
me
?
    
<EOS>
dear
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
can
not
find
my
letter
,
and
so
I
will
try
to
recollect
it
all
,
and
be
as
brief
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
all
go
well
enough
in
the
main
for
some
time
after
my
letter
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
see
some
reason
to
suspect
;
for
he
would
look
upon
me
,
whenever
he
see
me
,
in
such
a
manner
,
as
shew
not
well
;
and
one
day
he
come
to
me
,
as
I
be
in
the
summer
-
house
in
the
little
garden
,
at
work
with
my
needle
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
be
just
go
from
me
;
and
I
would
have
go
out
,
but
<EOS>
he
say
,
no
do
not
go
,
Pamela
;
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
;
and
you
always
fly
me
when
I
come
near
you
,
as
if
you
be
afraid
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
out
of
countenance
,
you
may
well
think
;
but
say
,
at
last
,
It
do
not
become
your
good
servant
to
stay
in
your
presence
,
sir
,
without
your
business
require
it
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
always
know
my
place
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
my
business
do
require
it
sometimes
;
and
I
have
a
mind
you
should
stay
to
hear
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
still
confound
,
and
begin
to
tremble
,
and
the
more
when
he
take
me
by
the
hand
;
for
now
no
soul
be
near
us
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
daver
,
say
he
,
(
and
seem
,
I
think
,
to
be
as
much
at
a
loss
for
word
as
I
,
)
would
have
have
you
live
with
her
;
but
she
would
not
do
for
you
what
I
be
resolve
to
do
,
if
you
continue
faithful
and
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
what
say'st
thou
,
my
girl
?
<EOS>
say
he
,
with
some
eagerness
;
had'st
thou
not
rather
stay
with
me
,
than
go
to
my
sister
daver
?
 
<EOS>
He
look
so
,
as
fill
me
with
affrightment
;
I
do
not
know
how
;
wildly
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
I
could
speak
,
Your
honour
will
forgive
me
;
<EOS>
but
as
you
have
no
lady
for
me
to
wait
upon
,
and
my
good
lady
have
be
now
dead
this
twelvemonth
,
I
have
rather
,
if
it
would
not
displease
you
,
wait
upon
Lady
Davers
,
because
   
I
be
proceed
,
and
he
say
,
a
little
hastily
 
<EOS>
because
you
be
a
little
fool
,
and
know
not
what
be
good
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
will
make
a
gentlewoman
of
you
,
if
you
be
oblige
,
and
do
not
stand
in
your
own
light
;
and
so
say
,
he
put
his
arm
about
me
,
and
kiss
me
!
  
<EOS>
now
,
you
will
say
,
all
his
wickedness
appear
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
struggle
and
tremble
,
and
be
so
benumb
with
terror
,
that
I
sink
down
,
not
in
a
fit
,
and
yet
not
myself
;
and
I
find
myself
in
his
arm
,
quite
void
of
strength
;
and
he
kiss
me
two
or
three
time
,
with
frightful
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
a
t
last
I
burst
from
him
,
and
be
get
out
of
the
summer
-
house
;
but
he
hold
me
back
,
and
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
my
life
for
a
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
I
will
do
you
no
harm
,
Pamela
;
do
not
be
afraid
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
will
not
stay
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
,
hussy
!
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
do
you
know
whom
you
speak
to
?
 
<EOS>
I
lose
all
fear
,
and
all
respect
,
and
say
,
yes
,
I
do
,
sir
,
too
well
!
 
<EOS>
well
may
I
forget
that
I
be
your
servant
,
when
you
forget
what
belong
to
a
master
.
  
<EOS>
I
sob
and
cry
most
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
foolish
hussy
you
be
!
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
have
I
do
you
any
harm
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
I
,
the
great
harm
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
You
have
teach
me
to
forget
myself
and
what
belong
to
me
,
and
have
lessen
the
distance
that
fortune
have
make
between
us
,
by
demean
yourself
,
to
be
so
free
to
a
poor
servant
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
sir
,
I
will
be
bold
to
say
,
I
be
honest
,
though
poor
:
and
if
you
be
a
prince
,
I
would
not
be
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
angry
,
and
say
,
who
would
have
you
otherwise
,
you
foolish
slut
!
<EOS>
cease
your
blubbering
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
I
have
demean
myself
;
but
it
be
only
to
try
you
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
can
keep
this
matter
secret
,
you
will
give
me
the
well
opinion
of
your
prudence
;
and
here
be
something
,
say
he
,
put
some
gold
in
my
hand
,
to
make
you
amend
for
the
fright
<EOS>
I
put
you
in
.
 
<EOS>
go
,
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
do
not
go
in
till
your
blubbering
be
over
:
and
I
charge
you
say
nothing
of
what
be
past
,
and
all
shall
be
well
,
and
I
will
forgive
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
take
the
money
,
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
poor
as
I
be
<EOS>
I
will
not
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
to
say
truth
,
I
think
it
look
like
take
earnest
,
and
so
I
put
it
upon
the
bench
;
and
as
he
seem
vexed
and
confused
at
what
he
have
do
,
I
take
the
opportunity
to
open
the
door
,
and
go
out
of
the
summer
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
call
to
me
,
and
say
,
be
secret
<EOS>
;
I
charge
you
,
Pamela
;
and
do
not
go
in
yet
,
as
I
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
poor
and
mean
must
those
action
be
,
and
how
little
must
they
make
the
good
of
gentleman
look
,
when
they
offer
such
thing
as
be
unworthy
of
themselves
,
and
put
it
into
the
power
of
their
inferior
to
be
great
than
they
!
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
turn
or
two
in
the
garden
,
but
in
sight
of
the
house
,
for
fear
of
the
bad
;
and
breathe
upon
my
hand
to
dry
my
eye
,
because
I
would
not
be
too
disobedient
.
 
<EOS>
My
next
shall
tell
you
more
.
  
<EOS>
pray
for
me
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
:
and
do
not
be
angry
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
run
away
from
this
house
,
so
late
my
comfort
and
delight
,
but
now
my
terror
and
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
break
off
hastily
.
                                 
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
and
honest
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
dear
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
now
proceed
with
my
sad
story
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
after
I
have
dry
my
eye
,
I
go
in
,
and
begin
to
ruminate
with
myself
what
I
have
best
to
do
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
I
would
leave
the
house
and
go
to
the
next
town
,
and
wait
an
opportunity
to
get
to
you
;
but
then
I
be
at
a
loss
to
resolve
whether
to
take
away
the
thing
he
have
give
me
or
no
,
and
how
to
take
them
away
:
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
to
leave
them
behind
me
,
and
only
go
with
the
clothe
on
my
back
,
but
then
I
have
two
mile
and
a
half
,
and
a
byway
,
to
the
town
;
and
be
pretty
well
dressed
,
I
may
come
to
some
harm
,
almost
as
bad
as
what
I
would
run
away
from
;
and
then
may
-
be
,
think
I
,
it
will
be
report
,
I
have
steal
something
,
and
so
be
force
to
run
away
;
and
to
carry
a
bad
name
back
with
me
to
my
dear
parent
,
would
be
a
sad
thing
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
wish
for
my
grey
russet
again
,
and
my
poor
honest
dress
,
with
which
you
fit
me
out
,
(
and
hard
enough
too
it
be
for
you
to
do
it
!
)
<EOS>
for
go
to
this
place
,
when
I
be
not
twelve
year
old
,
in
my
good
lady
's
day
!
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
of
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
take
her
advice
,
and
only
fear
his
command
to
be
secret
;
for
,
think
I
,
he
may
be
ashamed
of
his
action
,
and
never
attempt
the
like
again
:
<EOS>
and
as
poor
Mrs.
Jervis
depend
upon
him
,
through
misfortune
,
that
have
attend
her
,
I
think
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
to
bring
his
displeasure
upon
her
for
my
sake
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
quandary
,
now
consider
,
now
cry
,
and
not
know
what
to
do
,
I
pass
the
time
in
my
chamber
till
evening
;
when
desire
to
be
excuse
go
to
supper
,
Mrs.
Jervis
come
up
to
me
,
and
say
,
why
must
I
sup
without
you
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
come
,
I
see
you
be
troubled
at
something
;
tell
me
what
be
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
I
may
be
permit
to
be
with
her
on
night
;
for
I
be
afraid
of
spirit
,
and
they
would
not
hurt
such
a
good
person
as
she
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
silly
excuse
,
she
say
;
for
why
be
not
you
afraid
of
spirit
before
?
  
<EOS>
(
indeed
I
do
not
think
of
that
.
)
 
<EOS>
but
you
shall
be
my
bed
-
fellow
with
all
my
heart
,
add
she
,
<EOS>
let
your
reason
be
what
it
will
;
only
come
down
to
supper
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
to
be
excuse
;
for
,
say
I
,
I
have
be
cry
so
,
that
it
will
be
take
notice
of
by
my
fellow
-
servant
;
and
I
will
hide
nothing
from
you
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
when
we
be
alone
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
so
good
to
indulge
me
;
but
make
haste
to
come
up
to
bed
;
and
tell
the
servant
,
that
I
should
be
with
her
,
because
she
could
not
rest
well
,
and
would
get
me
to
read
her
to
sleep
;
for
she
know
I
love
reading
,
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
alone
,
I
tell
her
all
that
have
pass
;
for
I
think
,
though
he
have
bid
me
not
,
yet
if
he
should
come
to
know
I
have
tell
,
it
would
be
no
bad
;
for
to
keep
a
secret
of
such
a
nature
,
would
be
,
as
I
apprehend
,
to
deprive
myself
of
the
good
advice
which
I
never
want
more
;
and
may
encourage
him
to
think
I
do
not
resent
it
as
I
ought
,
and
would
keep
bad
secret
,
and
so
make
him
do
bad
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
be
I
right
,
my
dear
mother
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
could
not
help
mingle
tear
with
my
tear
;
for
I
cry
all
the
time
I
be
tell
her
the
story
,
and
beg
her
to
advise
me
what
to
do
;
and
I
shew
her
my
dear
father
's
two
letter
,
and
she
praise
the
honesty
and
endite
of
them
,
and
say
pleasing
thing
to
me
of
you
both
.
<EOS>
but
she
beg
I
would
not
think
of
leave
my
service
;
for
,
say
she
,
in
all
likelihood
,
you
behave
so
virtuously
,
that
he
will
be
ashamed
of
what
he
have
do
,
and
never
offer
the
like
to
you
again
:
though
<EOS>
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
she
,
I
fear
more
for
your
prettiness
than
for
anything
else
;
because
the
good
man
in
the
land
may
love
you
:
so
she
be
pleased
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
She
wish
it
be
in
her
power
to
live
independent
;
then
she
would
take
a
little
private
house
,
and
I
should
live
with
her
like
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
as
you
order
me
to
take
her
advice
,
I
resolve
to
tarry
to
see
how
thing
go
,
except
he
be
to
turn
me
away
;
although
,
in
your
first
letter
,
you
order
me
to
come
away
the
moment
I
have
any
reason
to
be
apprehensive
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
it
be
not
disobedience
,
I
hope
,
that
I
stay
;
for
I
could
not
expect
a
blessing
,
or
the
good
fruit
of
your
prayer
for
me
,
if
I
be
disobedient
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
next
day
I
be
very
sad
,
and
begin
my
long
letter
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
me
write
,
and
say
(
as
I
mention
)
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
girl
be
always
scribble
;
<EOS>
methink
she
may
find
something
else
to
do
,
or
to
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
finish
my
letter
,
I
put
it
under
the
toilet
in
my
late
lady
's
dressing
-
room
<EOS>
,
whither
nobody
come
but
myself
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
besides
my
master
;
but
when
I
come
up
again
to
seal
it
,
to
my
great
concern
,
it
be
go
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
know
nothing
of
it
;
and
nobody
know
of
my
master
's
have
be
near
the
place
in
the
time
;
so
I
have
be
sadly
troubled
about
it
:
but
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
well
as
I
,
think
he
have
it
,
<EOS>
some
how
or
other
;
and
he
appear
cross
and
angry
,
and
seem
to
shun
me
,
as
much
as
he
say
I
do
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
better
be
so
than
bad
!
  
<EOS>
but
he
have
order
Mrs.
Jervis
to
bid
me
not
pass
so
much
time
in
writing
;
which
be
a
poor
matter
for
such
a
gentleman
as
he
to
take
notice
of
,
as
I
be
not
idle
other
way
,
if
he
do
not
resent
what
he
think
I
write
upon
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
have
no
very
good
look
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
good
deal
easy
since
I
lie
with
Mrs.
Jervis
;
though
,
after
all
,
the
fear
I
live
in
on
one
side
,
and
his
frowning
and
displeasure
at
what
I
do
on
the
other
,
make
me
more
miserable
than
enough
.
  
<EOS>
o
that
I
have
never
leave
my
little
bed
in
the
loft
,
to
be
thus
expose
to
temptation
on
one
hand
,
or
disgust
on
the
other
!
 
<EOS>
how
happy
be
I
awhile
ago
!
 
<EOS>
how
contrary
now
!
 
<EOS>
pity
and
pray
for
                                         
Your
afflict
    
PAMELA
.
    
<EOS>
My
dearest
child
,
  
<EOS>
Our
heart
bleed
for
your
distress
,
and
the
temptation
you
be
expose
to
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
our
hourly
prayer
;
and
we
would
have
you
flee
this
evil
great
house
and
man
,
if
you
find
he
renew
his
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
You
ought
to
have
do
it
at
first
,
have
you
not
have
Mrs.
Jervis
to
advise
with
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
find
no
fault
in
your
conduct
hitherto
:
<EOS>
but
it
make
our
heart
ache
for
fear
of
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
o
my
child
!
<EOS>
temptation
be
sore
thing
,
 
but
yet
,
without
them
,
we
know
not
ourselves
,
nor
what
we
be
able
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Your
danger
be
very
great
;
for
you
have
rich
,
youth
,
and
a
fine
gentleman
,
as
the
world
reckon
him
,
to
withstand
;
but
how
great
will
be
your
honour
to
withstand
them
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
we
consider
your
past
conduct
,
and
your
virtuous
education
,
and
that
you
have
be
breed
to
be
more
ashamed
of
dishonesty
than
poverty
,
we
trust
in
God
,
that
He
will
enable
you
to
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
as
we
can
not
see
but
your
life
must
be
a
burthen
to
you
,
through
the
great
apprehension
always
upon
you
;
and
that
it
may
be
presumptuous
to
trust
too
much
to
our
own
strength
;
and
that
you
be
but
very
young
;
and
the
devil
may
put
it
into
his
heart
to
use
some
stratagem
,
of
which
great
man
be
full
,
to
decoy
you
<EOS>
:
I
think
you
have
better
come
home
to
share
our
poverty
with
safety
,
than
live
with
so
much
discontent
in
a
plenty
,
that
itself
may
be
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
God
direct
you
for
the
good
!
 
<EOS>
while
you
have
Mrs.
Jervis
for
an
adviser
and
bed
-
fellow
,
(
<EOS>
and
,
o
my
dear
child
!
<EOS>
that
be
prudently
do
of
you
,
)
<EOS>
we
be
easy
than
we
should
be
;
and
so
commit
you
to
the
divine
protection
,
remain
                            
<EOS>
Your
truly
loving
,
but
careful

FATHER
and
MOTHER
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
Mrs.
Jervis
and
I
have
live
very
comfortably
together
for
this
fortnight
past
;
for
my
master
be
all
that
time
at
his
Lincolnshire
estate
,
and
at
his
sister
's
,
the
Lady
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
come
home
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
some
talk
with
Mrs.
Jervis
soon
after
,
and
mostly
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
to
her
,
it
seem
,
well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
know
Pamela
have
your
good
word
;
but
do
you
think
her
of
any
use
in
the
family
?
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
she
be
surprised
at
the
question
,
but
say
,
that
I
be
one
of
the
most
virtuous
and
industrious
young
creature
that
ever
she
know
.
 
<EOS>
why
that
word
virtuous
,
say
he
,
I
pray
you
?
 
<EOS>
be
there
any
reason
to
suppose
her
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
or
have
any
body
take
it
into
his
head
to
try
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
sir
,
say
she
,
you
ask
such
a
question
!
 
<EOS>
who
dare
offer
any
thing
to
her
in
such
an
orderly
and
well
-
govern
house
as
yours
,
and
under
a
master
of
so
good
a
character
for
virtue
and
honour
?
 
<EOS>
Your
servant
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
he
,
for
your
good
opinion
:
but
pray
,
if
any
body
do
,
do
you
think
Pamela
would
let
you
know
it
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
say
she
,
she
be
a
poor
innocent
young
creature
,
and
I
believe
have
so
much
confidence
in
me
,
that
she
would
take
my
advice
as
soon
as
she
would
her
mother
's
.
 
<EOS>
innocent
!
<EOS>
again
,
and
virtuous
,
I
warrant
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
you
abound
with
your
epithet
;
but
I
take
her
to
be
an
artful
young
baggage
;
and
have
I
a
young
handsome
butler
or
steward
,
she
would
soon
make
her
market
of
one
of
them
,
if
she
think
it
worth
while
to
snap
at
him
for
a
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Alack
-
a
-
day
,
sir
,
say
she
,
it
be
early
day
with
Pamela
;
and
she
do
not
yet
think
of
a
husband
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
:
and
your
steward
and
butler
be
both
man
in
year
,
and
think
nothing
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
he
,
if
they
be
young
,
they
would
have
more
wit
than
to
think
of
such
a
girl
;
I
will
tell
you
my
mind
of
her
,
Mrs.
Jervis
:
I
do
not
think
this
same
favourite
of
yours
<EOS>
so
very
artless
<EOS>
a
girl
as
you
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
to
dispute
with
your
honour
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
;
but
I
dare
say
,
if
the
man
will
let
her
alone
,
she
will
never
trouble
herself
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
he
,
be
there
any
man
that
will
not
let
her
alone
,
that
you
know
of
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
say
she
;
she
keep
herself
so
much
to
herself
,
and
yet
behave
so
prudently
,
that
they
all
esteem
her
,
and
shew
her
as
great
a
respect
as
if
she
be
a
gentlewoman
bear
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
say
he
,
that
be
her
art
,
that
I
be
speak
of
:
<EOS>
but
,
let
me
tell
you
,
the
girl
have
vanity
and
conceit
,
and
pride
too
,
or
I
be
mistaken
;
and
,
perhaps
,
I
could
give
you
an
instance
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
she
,
you
can
see
farther
than
such
a
poor
silly
woman
as
I
be
;
but
I
never
see
any
thing
but
innocence
in
her
 
and
virtue
too
<EOS>
,
I
will
warrant
ye
!
<EOS>
say
he
.
<EOS>
but
suppose
I
could
give
you
an
instance
,
where
she
have
talk
a
little
too
freely
of
the
kindness
that
have
be
shew
her
from
a
certain
quarter
;
and
have
have
the
vanity
to
impute
a
few
kind
word
,
utter
in
mere
compassion
to
her
youth
and
circumstance
,
into
a
design
upon
her
,
and
even
dare
to
make
free
with
name
that
she
ought
never
to
mention
but
with
reverence
and
gratitude
;
what
would
you
say
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
Say
,
sir
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
I
can
not
tell
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
Pamela
incapable
of
such
ingratitude
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
no
more
of
this
silly
girl
,
say
he
;
<EOS>
you
may
only
advise
her
,
as
you
be
her
friend
,
not
to
give
herself
too
much
licence
upon
the
favour
she
meet
with
;
and
if
she
stay
here
,
that
she
will
not
write
the
affair
of
my
family
purely
for
an
exercise
to
her
pen
,
and
her
invention
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
she
be
a
subtle
,
artful
gipsy
,
and
time
will
shew
it
you
.
  
<EOS>
be
ever
the
like
hear
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
he
do
not
expect
to
meet
with
such
a
repulse
,
and
mistrust
that
I
have
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
have
my
long
letter
too
,
that
I
intend
for
you
;
and
so
be
vexed
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
better
be
think
artful
and
subtle
,
than
be
so
,
in
his
sense
;
and
,
as
light
as
he
make
of
the
word
virtue
and
innocence
in
me
,
he
would
have
make
a
less
angry
construction
,
have
I
less
deserved
that
he
should
do
so
;
for
then
,
may
be
,
my
crime
should
have
be
my
virtue
with
him
<EOS>
naughty
gentleman
as
he
be
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
soon
write
again
;
but
must
now
end
with
say
,
that
I
be
,
and
shall
always
be
,
                     
Your
honest
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
dear
MOTHER
,
  
I
break
off
abruptly
my
last
letter
;
for
I
fear
he
be
come
;
and
so
it
happen
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
the
letter
in
my
bosom
,
and
take
up
my
work
,
which
lie
by
me
;
but
I
have
so
little
of
the
artful
,
as
he
call
it
,
that
I
look
as
confused
as
if
I
have
be
do
some
great
harm
.
  
<EOS>
sit
still
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
mind
your
work
,
for
all
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
tell
me
I
be
welcome
home
,
after
my
journey
to
Lincolnshire
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
,
sir
,
say
I
,
if
you
be
not
always
welcome
to
your
honour
's
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
go
;
but
he
say
,
do
not
run
away
,
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
good
sir
,
how
my
heart
go
pit
-
a
-
pat
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
a
little
kind
to
you
,
say
he
,
in
the
summer
-
house
,
and
you
carry
yourself
so
foolishly
upon
it
,
as
if
I
have
intend
to
do
you
great
harm
<EOS>
,
do
I
not
tell
you
you
should
take
no
notice
of
what
pass
to
any
creature
?
<EOS>
and
yet
you
have
make
a
common
talk
of
the
matter
,
not
consider
either
my
reputation
,
or
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
common
talk
of
it
,
sir
!
<EOS>
say
I
:
I
have
nobody
to
talk
to
,
hardly
.
  
<EOS>
He
interrupt
me
,
and
say
,
hardly
!
<EOS>
you
little
equivocator
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
hardly
?
 
<EOS>
let
me
ask
you
,
have
not
you
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
for
one
?
<EOS>
pray
your
honour
,
say
I
,
all
in
agitation
,
let
me
go
down
;
for
it
be
not
for
me
to
hold
an
argument
with
your
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Equivocator
,
again
!
say
he
,
and
take
my
hand
,
what
do
you
talk
of
an
argument
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
hold
an
argument
with
me
to
answer
a
plain
question
?
 
<EOS>
answer
me
what
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
good
sir
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
let
me
beg
you
will
not
urge
me
farther
,
for
fear
<EOS>
I
forget
myself
again
,
and
be
saucy
.
  
<EOS>
answer
me
then
<EOS>
,
I
bid
you
,
say
he
,
have
you
not
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
?
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
saucy
in
you
if
you
do
not
answer
me
directly
to
what
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
and
fain
would
have
pull
my
hand
away
<EOS>
,
perhaps
I
should
be
for
answer
you
by
another
question
,
and
that
would
not
become
me
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
you
would
say
?
<EOS>
reply
he
;
speak
out
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
say
I
,
why
should
your
honour
be
so
angry
I
should
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
,
or
any
body
else
,
what
pass
,
if
you
intend
no
harm
?
  
<EOS>
well
say
,
pretty
innocent
and
artless
!
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Jervis
call
you
,
say
he
;
and
be
it
thus
you
taunt
and
retort
upon
me
,
insolent
as
you
be
!
<EOS>
but
still
I
will
be
answer
directly
to
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
will
not
tell
a
lie
for
the
world
:
I
do
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
;
for
my
heart
be
almost
break
;
but
I
open
not
my
mouth
to
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
,
boldface
,
say
he
,
and
equivocator
again
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
open
your
mouth
to
any
other
;
but
do
not
you
write
to
some
other
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
now
,
and
please
your
honour
,
say
I
,
(
for
I
be
quite
courageous
just
then
,
)
you
could
not
have
ask
me
this
question
,
if
you
have
not
take
from
me
my
letter
to
my
father
and
mother
,
in
which
I
own
<EOS>
I
have
break
my
mind
freely
to
them
,
and
ask
their
advice
,
and
pour
forth
my
griefs
!
  
<EOS>
and
so
I
be
to
be
expose
,
be
I
,
<EOS>
say
he
,
in
my
own
house
,
and
out
of
my
house
,
to
the
whole
world
,
by
such
a
sauce
-
box
as
you
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
good
sir
,
say
I
,
and
I
hope
your
honour
will
not
be
angry
with
me
;
it
be
not
I
that
expose
you
,
if
I
say
nothing
but
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
taunt
again
!
<EOS>
assurance
as
you
be
!
<EOS>
say
he
:
I
will
not
be
thus
talk
to
!
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
say
I
,
of
whom
can
a
poor
girl
take
advice
,
if
it
must
not
be
of
her
father
and
mother
,
and
such
a
good
woman
as
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
,
for
her
sex
-
sake
,
should
give
it
me
when
ask
?
 
<EOS>
Insolence
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
and
stamp
with
his
foot
,
be
I
to
be
question
thus
by
such
a
one
as
you
?
<EOS>
I
fall
down
on
my
knee
,
and
say
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
your
honour
,
pity
a
poor
creature
,
that
know
nothing
of
her
duty
,
but
how
to
cherish
her
virtue
and
good
name
:
I
have
nothing
else
to
trust
to
:
and
,
though
poor
and
friendless
here
,
yet
I
have
always
be
teach
to
value
honesty
above
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
ado
with
your
honesty
,
say
he
,
foolish
girl
!
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
one
part
of
honesty
to
be
dutiful
and
grateful
to
your
master
,
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
it
be
impossible
I
should
be
ungrateful
to
your
honour
,
or
disobedient
,
or
deserve
the
name
of
bold
-
face
or
insolent
,
which
you
call
me
,
but
when
your
command
be
contrary
to
that
first
duty
which
shall
ever
be
the
principle
of
my
life
!
  
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
move
,
and
rise
up
,
and
walk
into
the
great
chamber
two
or
three
turn
,
leave
me
on
my
knee
;
and
I
throw
my
apron
over
my
face
,
and
lay
my
head
on
a
chair
,
and
cry
as
if
my
heart
would
break
,
have
no
power
to
stir
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
come
in
again
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
with
mischief
in
his
heart
!
<EOS>
and
raise
me
up
,
he
say
,
rise
,
Pamela
,
rise
;
you
be
your
own
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Your
perverse
folly
will
be
your
ruin
:
I
tell
you
this
,
that
I
be
very
much
displeased
with
the
freedom
you
have
take
with
my
name
to
my
housekeeper
,
as
also
to
your
father
and
mother
;
and
you
may
as
well
have
real
cause
to
take
these
freedom
with
me
,
as
to
make
my
name
suffer
for
imaginary
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
say
so
,
he
offer
to
take
me
on
his
knee
,
with
some
force
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
be
terrified
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
like
as
I
have
read
in
a
book
a
night
or
two
before
,
Angels
and
saint
,
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
,
defend
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
may
I
never
survive
one
moment
<EOS>
that
fatal
one
in
which
I
shall
forfeit
my
innocence
!
 
<EOS>
pretty
fool
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
how
will
you
forfeit
your
innocence
,
if
you
be
oblige
to
yield
to
a
force
you
can
not
withstand
?
 
<EOS>
be
easy
,
say
he
;
for
let
the
bad
happen
that
can
,
you
will
have
the
merit
,
and
I
the
blame
;
and
it
will
be
a
good
subject
for
letter
to
your
father
and
mother
,
and
a
tale
into
the
bargain
for
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
He
by
force
kiss
my
neck
and
lip
;
and
say
,
whoever
blame
Lucretia
?
<EOS>
all
the
shame
lie
on
the
ravisher
only
<EOS>
and
I
be
content
to
take
all
the
blame
upon
me
,
as
I
have
already
bear
too
great
a
share
for
what
I
have
not
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
May
I
,
say
I
,
Lucretia
like
,
justify
myself
with
my
death
,
if
I
be
use
barbarously
!
 
<EOS>
o
my
good
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
tauntingly
,
you
be
well
read
,
I
see
;
and
we
shall
make
out
between
us
,
before
we
have
do
,
a
pretty
story
in
romance
,
I
warrant
ye
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
put
his
hand
in
my
bosom
,
and
indignation
give
me
double
strength
,
and
I
get
loose
from
him
by
a
sudden
spring
,
and
run
out
of
the
room
!
<EOS>
and
the
next
chamber
be
open
,
I
make
shift
to
get
into
it
,
and
throw
to
the
door
,
and
it
lock
after
me
;
but
he
follow
me
so
close
,
he
get
hold
of
my
gown
,
and
tear
a
piece
off
,
which
hang
without
the
door
;
for
the
key
be
on
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
I
just
remember
I
get
into
the
room
;
for
I
know
nothing
further
of
the
matter
till
afterwards
;
for
I
fall
into
a
fit
with
my
terror
,
and
there
I
lay
,
till
he
,
as
I
suppose
,
look
through
the
key
-
hole
,
spy
me
upon
the
floor
,
stretch
out
at
length
,
on
my
face
;
and
then
he
call
Mrs.
Jervis
to
me
,
who
,
by
his
assistance
,
burst
open
the
door
<EOS>
,
he
go
away
,
see
me
come
to
myself
;
and
bid
her
say
nothing
of
the
matter
,
if
she
be
wise
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Jervis
think
it
be
bad
,
and
cry
over
me
like
as
if
she
be
my
mother
;
and
I
be
two
hour
before
I
come
to
myself
;
and
just
as
I
get
a
little
up
on
my
foot
,
he
come
in
,
I
faint
away
again
with
the
terror
;
and
so
he
withdraw
:
<EOS>
but
he
staid
in
the
next
room
to
let
nobody
come
near
us
,
that
his
foul
proceeding
may
not
be
know
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
give
me
her
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
have
cut
my
lace
,
and
set
me
in
a
great
chair
,
and
he
call
her
to
him
:
<EOS>
how
be
the
girl
?
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
fool
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
nothing
at
all
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
could
not
speak
for
cry
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
say
,
She
have
tell
you
,
it
seem
,
that
I
be
kind
to
her
in
the
summer
-
house
,
though
I
will
assure
you
,
I
be
quite
innocent
then
as
well
as
now
;
and
I
desire
you
to
keep
this
matter
to
yourself
,
and
let
me
not
be
name
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
she
,
for
your
honour
's
sake
,
and
for
Christ
's
sake
!
 
<EOS>
but
he
would
not
hear
her
,
and
say
 
for
your
own
sake
,
I
tell
you
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
not
a
word
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
her
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
not
have
her
stay
in
my
house
;
prate
,
perverse
fool
,
as
she
be
!
 
<EOS>
but
since
she
be
so
apt
to
fall
into
fit
,
or
at
least
pretend
to
do
so
,
prepare
her
to
see
me
to
-
morrow
after
dinner
,
in
my
mother
's
closet
,
and
do
you
be
with
her
,
and
you
shall
hear
what
pass
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
out
in
a
pet
,
and
order
his
chariot
and
four
to
be
get
ready
,
and
go
a
visiting
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
then
come
to
me
,
and
I
tell
her
all
that
have
happen
,
and
say
,
I
be
resolve
not
to
stay
in
the
house
:
<EOS>
and
she
reply
<EOS>
,
He
seem
to
threaten
as
much
;
I
say
,
I
be
glad
of
that
;
then
I
shall
be
easy
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
tell
me
all
he
have
say
to
her
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
be
very
loath
I
should
go
;
and
yet
,
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
she
begin
to
be
afraid
for
herself
;
but
would
not
have
me
ruin
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
to
be
sure
he
mean
no
good
;
but
may
be
,
now
he
see
me
so
resolute
,
he
will
give
over
all
attempt
;
and
that
I
shall
better
know
what
to
do
after
tomorrow
,
when
I
be
to
appear
before
a
very
bad
judge
,
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
I
dread
this
to
-
morrow
's
appearance
!
 
<EOS>
but
be
as
assure
,
<EOS>
my
dear
parent
,
of
the
honesty
of
your
poor
child
,
as
I
be
of
your
prayer
for
                                        
Your
dutiful
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
o
this
frightful
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
;
how
I
dread
it
!
    
<EOS>
my
dear
parent
,
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
long
to
hear
from
me
soon
;
and
I
send
you
as
soon
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
you
may
believe
how
uneasily
I
pass
the
time
,
till
his
appoint
hour
come
.
 
<EOS>
every
minute
,
as
it
grow
near
,
my
terror
increase
;
and
sometimes
I
have
great
courage
,
and
sometimes
none
at
all
;
and
I
think
I
should
faint
when
it
come
to
the
time
my
master
have
dine
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
,
for
my
part
;
and
do
what
I
could
,
my
eye
be
swell
with
crying
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
go
up
to
the
closet
,
which
be
my
good
lady
's
dressing
-
room
;
a
room
I
once
love
,
but
then
as
much
hate
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
your
heart
ache
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
mine
flutter
about
like
a
new
-
catch
bird
in
a
cage
.
 
<EOS>
o
Pamela
,
say
I
to
myself
,
why
art
thou
so
foolish
and
fearful
?
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
do
no
harm
!
 
<EOS>
what
,
if
thou
fearest
an
unjust
judge
,
when
thou
art
innocent
,
would'st
thou
do
before
a
just
one
,
if
thou
wert
guilty
?
 
<EOS>
have
courage
,
Pamela
,
thou
knowest
the
bad
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
easy
a
choice
poverty
and
honesty
be
,
rather
than
plenty
and
wickedness
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
cheer
myself
;
but
yet
my
poor
heart
sink
,
and
my
spirit
be
quite
broken
.
 
<EOS>
everything
that
stir
<EOS>
,
I
think
be
to
call
me
to
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
dread
it
,
and
yet
I
wish
it
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
at
last
he
ring
the
bell
:
<EOS>
o
,
think
I
,
that
it
be
my
passing
-
bell
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
go
up
,
with
a
full
heart
enough
,
poor
good
woman
!
<EOS>
He
say
,
where
be
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
let
her
come
up
,
and
do
you
come
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
to
me
:
I
be
ready
to
go
with
my
foot
;
but
my
heart
be
with
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
wish
to
share
your
poverty
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
up
,
however
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
can
wicked
man
seem
so
steady
and
untouched
with
such
black
heart
,
while
poor
innocent
stand
like
malefactor
before
them
!
  
<EOS>
He
look
so
stern
,
that
my
heart
fail
me
,
and
I
wish
myself
any
<EOS>
where
but
there
,
though
I
have
before
be
summon
up
all
my
courage
.
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
say
I
to
myself
,
give
me
courage
to
stand
before
this
naughty
master
!
 
<EOS>
o
soften
him
,
or
harden
me
!
  
<EOS>
come
in
,
fool
,
say
he
,
angrily
,
as
soon
as
he
see
me
;
(
and
snatch
my
hand
with
a
pull
;
)
you
may
well
be
ashamed
to
see
me
,
after
your
noise
and
nonsense
,
and
expose
me
as
you
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
ashame
to
see
you
!
<EOS>
think
I
:
very
pretty
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
he
,
here
you
be
both
together
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
sit
down
;
but
let
her
stand
,
if
she
will
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
think
I
,
if
I
can
;
for
my
knee
beat
one
against
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
not
think
,
when
you
see
the
girl
in
the
way
you
find
her
in
,
that
I
have
give
her
the
great
occasion
for
complaint
,
that
could
possibly
be
give
to
a
woman
?
 
<EOS>
and
that
I
have
actually
ruin
her
,
as
she
call
it
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
,
could
you
think
any
thing
less
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
say
she
,
I
fear
so
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
have
she
tell
you
what
I
do
to
her
,
and
all
I
do
to
her
,
to
occasion
all
this
folly
,
by
which
my
reputation
may
have
suffer
in
your
opinion
,
and
in
that
of
all
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
inform
me
,
what
she
have
tell
you
?
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
too
much
frightened
,
as
she
own
afterwards
,
at
his
sternness
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
indeed
she
tell
me
you
only
pull
her
on
your
knee
,
and
kiss
her
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
pluck
up
my
spirit
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
only
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
say
I
;
and
be
not
that
enough
to
shew
me
what
I
have
to
fear
?
 
<EOS>
when
a
master
of
his
honour
's
degree
demean
himself
to
be
so
free
as
that
to
such
a
poor
servant
as
me
,
what
be
the
next
to
be
expect
?
 
<EOS>
but
your
honour
go
farther
,
so
you
do
;
and
threaten
me
what
you
would
do
,
and
talk
of
Lucretia
,
and
her
hard
fate
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
know
you
go
too
far
for
a
master
to
a
servant
,
or
even
to
his
equal
;
and
I
can
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
fall
a
crying
most
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
begin
to
excuse
me
,
and
to
beg
he
would
pity
a
poor
maiden
,
that
have
such
a
value
for
her
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
speak
it
to
her
face
,
I
think
her
very
pretty
,
and
I
think
her
humble
,
and
one
that
would
not
grow
upon
my
favour
,
or
the
notice
I
take
of
her
;
but
I
abhor
the
thought
of
force
her
to
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
myself
better
,
say
he
,
and
what
belong
to
me
:
<EOS>
and
to
be
sure
I
have
enough
demean
myself
to
take
notice
of
such
a
one
as
she
;
but
I
be
bewitch
by
her
,
I
think
,
to
be
free
than
become
me
;
though
I
have
no
intention
to
carry
the
jest
farther
.
  
<EOS>
what
poor
stuff
be
all
this
,
my
dear
mother
,
from
a
man
of
his
sense
!
<EOS>
but
see
how
a
bad
cause
and
bad
action
confound
the
great
wit
!
 
<EOS>
It
give
me
a
little
more
courage
then
;
for
innocence
,
I
find
,
in
a
low
fortune
,
and
weak
mind
,
have
many
advantage
over
guilt
,
with
all
its
rich
and
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
say
,
Your
honour
may
call
this
jest
or
sport
,
or
what
you
please
;
but
indeed
,
sir
,
it
be
not
a
jest
that
become
the
distance
between
a
master
and
a
servant
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
hear
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
say
he
:
do
you
hear
the
pertness
of
the
creature
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
deal
of
this
sort
before
in
the
summer
-
house
,
and
yesterday
too
,
which
make
me
rough
with
her
than
perhaps
<EOS>
I
have
otherwise
be
.
  
<EOS>
say
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Pamela
,
do
not
be
so
pert
to
his
honour
:
<EOS>
you
should
know
your
distance
;
you
see
his
honour
be
only
in
jest
.
 
<EOS>
o
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
do
not
you
blame
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
difficult
to
keep
one
's
distance
to
the
great
of
man
,
when
they
will
not
keep
it
themselves
to
their
mean
servant
.
  
<EOS>
see
again
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
could
you
believe
this
of
the
young
baggage
,
if
you
have
not
hear
it
?
 
<EOS>
good
your
honour
<EOS>
,
say
the
well
-
mean
gentlewoman
,
pity
and
forgive
the
poor
girl
;
she
be
but
a
girl
,
and
her
virtue
be
very
dear
to
her
;
and
I
will
pawn
my
life
for
her
<EOS>
,
she
will
never
be
pert
to
your
honour
,
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
molest
her
no
more
,
nor
frighten
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
sir
,
by
her
fit
,
she
be
in
terror
;
she
could
not
help
it
;
and
though
your
honour
intend
her
no
harm
,
yet
the
apprehension
be
almost
death
to
her
:
and
I
have
much
ado
to
bring
her
to
herself
again
.
 
<EOS>
o
the
little
hypocrite
!
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
;
she
have
all
the
art
of
her
sex
;
they
be
bear
with
her
;
and
I
tell
you
awhile
ago
you
do
not
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
reason
principally
of
my
call
you
before
me
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
be
likely
to
suffer
in
my
reputation
by
the
perverseness
and
folly
of
this
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
tell
you
all
,
and
perhaps
more
than
all
;
nay
,
I
make
no
doubt
of
it
;
and
she
have
write
letter
(
for
I
find
she
be
a
mighty
letter
-
writer
!
)
<EOS>
to
her
father
and
mother
,
and
other
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
in
which
represent
herself
as
an
angel
of
light
,
she
make
her
kind
master
and
benefactor
,
a
devil
incarnate
(
<EOS>
o
how
people
will
sometimes
,
think
I
,
call
themselves
by
their
right
name
!
)
 
<EOS>
and
all
this
,
add
he
,
<EOS>
I
will
not
hear
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
be
resolve
she
shall
return
to
the
distress
and
poverty
she
be
take
from
;
and
let
her
be
careful
how
she
use
my
name
with
freedom
,
when
she
be
go
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
brighten
up
at
once
with
these
welcome
word
,
and
I
throw
myself
upon
my
knee
at
his
foot
,
with
a
most
sincere
glad
heart
;
and
I
say
,
May
<EOS>
your
honour
be
for
ever
bless
for
your
resolution
!
 
<EOS>
now
I
shall
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
and
permit
me
,
on
my
bended
knee
,
to
thank
you
for
all
the
benefit
and
favour
you
have
heap
upon
me
;
for
the
opportunity
I
have
have
of
improvement
and
learning
,
through
my
good
lady
's
mean
,
and
yours
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
forget
all
your
honour
have
offer
me
:
and
I
promise
you
,
that
I
will
never
let
your
name
pass
my
lip
,
but
with
reverence
and
gratitude
:
<EOS>
and
so
God
Almighty
bless
your
honour
,
for
ever
and
ever
!
<EOS>
amen
.
  
<EOS>
then
rise
from
my
knee
,
I
go
away
with
another
-
guise
sort
of
heart
than
I
come
into
his
presence
with
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
fall
to
write
this
letter
.
<EOS>
and
thus
all
be
happily
over
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
expect
to
see
soon
your
poor
daughter
,
with
an
humble
and
dutiful
mind
,
<EOS>
return
to
you
:
and
do
not
fear
<EOS>
but
I
know
how
to
be
as
happy
with
you
as
ever
:
for
I
will
be
in
the
loft
,
as
I
use
to
do
;
and
pray
let
my
little
bed
be
get
ready
;
and
I
have
a
small
matter
of
money
,
which
will
buy
me
a
suit
of
clothe
,
fitter
for
my
condition
than
what
I
have
;
and
I
will
get
Mrs.
Mumford
to
help
me
to
some
needle
-
work
:
and
fear
not
that
I
shall
be
a
burden
to
you
,
if
my
health
continue
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
be
bless
,
if
not
for
my
own
sake
,
for
both
your
sake
,
who
have
,
in
all
your
trial
and
misfortune
,
preserve
so
much
integrity
as
make
every
body
speak
well
of
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
he
will
let
good
Mrs.
Jervis
give
me
a
character
,
<EOS>
for
fear
it
should
be
think
that
I
be
turn
away
for
dishonesty
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
my
dear
parent
,
may
you
be
bless
for
me
,
and
I
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
always
pray
for
my
master
and
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
so
good
night
;
for
it
be
late
,
and
I
shall
be
soon
call
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
Mrs.
Jervis
be
not
angry
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
call
me
to
supper
:
though
I
could
eat
nothing
if
she
have
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
make
no
doubt
I
shall
sleep
purely
to
-
night
,
and
dream
that
I
be
with
you
,
in
my
dear
,
dear
,
happy
loft
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
so
good
night
again
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
say
                                          
Your
poor
honest
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
not
come
this
week
,
because
I
must
get
up
the
linen
,
and
leave
in
order
every
thing
belong
to
my
place
.
 
<EOS>
so
send
me
a
line
,
if
you
can
,
to
let
me
know
if
I
shall
be
welcome
,
by
John
,
who
will
call
for
it
as
he
return
.
 
<EOS>
but
say
nothing
of
my
come
away
to
him
,
as
yet
:
for
it
will
be
say
I
blab
every
thing
.
    
<EOS>
my
dearest
daughter
,
  
welcome
,
<EOS>
welcome
,
<EOS>
ten
time
welcome
<EOS>
shall
you
be
to
us
;
for
you
come
to
us
innocent
,
and
happy
,
and
honest
;
and
you
be
the
staff
of
our
old
age
,
and
our
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
we
can
not
do
for
you
as
we
would
,
yet
,
fear
not
,
we
shall
live
happily
together
;
and
what
with
my
diligent
labour
,
and
your
poor
mother
's
spinning
,
and
your
needle
-
work
,
I
make
no
doubt
we
shall
do
well
and
better
.
 
<EOS>
only
your
poor
mother
's
eye
begin
to
fail
her
;
though
,
I
bless
God
,
I
be
as
strong
and
able
,
and
willing
to
labour
as
ever
;
and
,
o
my
dear
child
!
<EOS>
your
virtue
have
make
me
,
I
think
,
strong
and
well
than
I
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
what
bless
thing
be
trial
and
temptation
,
when
we
have
the
strength
to
resist
and
subdue
them
!
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
uneasy
about
those
same
four
guinea
;
I
think
you
should
give
them
back
again
to
your
master
;
and
yet
I
have
break
them
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
only
three
leave
;
but
I
will
borrow
the
fourth
,
if
I
can
,
part
upon
my
wage
,
and
part
of
Mrs.
Mumford
,
and
send
the
whole
sum
back
to
you
,
that
you
may
return
it
,
against
John
<EOS>
come
next
,
if
he
come
again
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
how
you
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
honest
John
will
be
glad
to
bear
you
company
part
of
the
way
,
if
your
master
be
not
so
cross
as
to
forbid
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
know
time
enough
,
your
mother
will
go
one
five
mile
,
and
I
will
go
ten
on
the
way
,
or
till
I
meet
you
,
as
far
as
one
holiday
will
go
;
for
that
I
can
get
leave
to
make
on
such
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
and
we
shall
receive
you
with
more
pleasure
than
we
have
at
your
birth
,
when
all
the
bad
be
over
;
or
than
we
ever
have
in
our
life
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
God
bless
you
till
the
happy
time
come
!
<EOS>
say
both
your
mother
and
I
,
which
be
all
at
present
,
from
                               
Your
truly
loving
PARENTS
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
thank
you
a
thousand
tine
for
your
goodness
to
me
,
express
in
your
last
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
long
to
get
my
business
do
,
and
come
to
my
new
old
lot
again
,
as
I
may
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
quite
another
thing
since
my
master
have
turn
me
off
:
and
as
I
shall
come
to
you
an
honest
daughter
,
what
pleasure
it
be
to
what
I
should
have
have
,
if
I
could
not
have
see
you
but
as
a
guilty
one
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
my
writing
-
time
will
soon
be
over
,
and
so
I
will
make
use
of
it
now
,
and
tell
you
all
that
have
happen
since
my
last
letter
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
Mrs.
Jervis
do
not
call
me
to
sup
with
her
,
and
fear
she
be
angry
;
and
when
I
have
finish
my
letter
,
I
long
for
her
come
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
come
up
,
but
seem
shy
and
reserve
;
and
I
say
,
My
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
be
glad
to
see
you
:
you
be
not
angry
with
me
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
she
be
sorry
thing
have
go
so
far
;
and
that
she
have
a
great
deal
of
talk
with
my
master
,
after
I
be
go
;
that
he
seem
move
at
what
I
say
,
and
at
my
falling
on
my
knee
to
him
,
and
my
prayer
for
him
,
at
my
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
I
be
a
strange
girl
;
he
know
not
what
to
make
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
she
go
?
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
I
intend
to
say
something
else
to
her
;
but
she
behave
so
oddly
,
that
I
have
not
power
to
stop
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
,
if
she
should
call
me
again
?
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
yes
;
<EOS>
and
then
,
no
,
let
her
go
;
it
be
good
for
her
and
me
too
;
and
she
shall
go
,
now
I
have
give
her
warning
.
 
<EOS>
where
she
have
it
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
I
never
meet
with
the
fellow
of
her
in
any
life
,
at
any
age
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
he
have
order
her
not
to
tell
me
all
:
<EOS>
but
she
believe
he
would
never
offer
any
thing
to
me
again
;
and
I
may
stay
,
she
fancy
,
if
I
would
beg
it
as
a
favour
;
though
she
be
not
sure
neither
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay
!
<EOS>
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
;
say
I
;
why
it
be
the
good
news
that
could
have
come
to
me
,
that
he
will
let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
nothing
but
long
to
go
back
again
to
my
poverty
and
distress
,
as
he
threaten
I
should
;
for
though
I
be
sure
of
the
poverty
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
have
half
the
distress
I
have
have
for
some
month
past
,
I
will
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
dear
good
soul
!
<EOS>
weep
over
me
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
Pamela
,
I
do
not
think
I
have
shew
so
little
love
to
you
,
as
that
you
should
express
so
much
joy
upon
leave
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
never
have
a
child
half
so
dear
to
me
as
you
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
hear
her
so
good
to
me
,
as
indeed
she
have
always
be
,
and
say
,
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
,
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
?
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
next
to
my
own
father
and
mother
,
and
to
leave
you
be
the
chief
concern
I
have
at
quit
this
place
;
but
I
be
sure
it
be
certain
ruin
if
I
stay
.
 
<EOS>
after
such
offer
,
and
such
threatening
,
and
his
compare
himself
to
a
wicked
ravisher
in
the
very
time
of
his
last
offer
;
and
turn
it
into
a
jest
,
that
we
should
make
a
pretty
story
in
a
romance
;
can
I
stay
and
be
safe
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
demean
himself
twice
?
 
<EOS>
and
it
behove
me
to
beware
of
the
third
time
,
for
fear
he
should
lay
his
snare
surer
;
for
perhaps
he
do
not
expect
a
poor
servant
would
resist
her
master
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
and
must
it
not
be
look
upon
as
a
sort
of
warrant
for
such
action
,
if
I
stay
after
this
?
 
<EOS>
for
,
I
think
,
when
one
of
our
sex
find
she
be
attempt
,
it
be
an
encouragement
to
the
attempter
to
proceed
,
if
one
put
one
's
self
in
the
way
of
it
,
when
one
can
help
it
:
'
Tis
neither
more
nor
less
than
invite
him
to
think
that
one
forgive
,
what
,
in
short
,
ought
not
to
be
forgive
:
which
be
no
small
countenance
to
foul
action
,
I
will
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
She
hug
me
to
her
,
and
say
I
will
assure
you
!
<EOS>
pretty
-
face
,
where
gottest
thou
all
thy
knowledge
,
and
thy
good
notion
,
at
these
year
?
<EOS>
Thou
art
a
miracle
for
thy
age
,
and
I
shall
always
love
thee
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
do
you
resolve
to
leave
us
,
Pamela
?
  
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
;
for
,
as
matter
stand
,
how
can
I
do
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
finish
the
duty
of
my
place
first
,
if
I
may
;
and
hope
you
will
give
me
a
character
,
as
to
my
honesty
,
that
it
may
not
he
think
I
be
turn
away
for
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
that
I
will
,
say
she
;
I
will
give
thee
such
a
character
as
never
girl
at
thy
year
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
I
will
always
love
and
honour
you
,
as
my
third
-
good
friend
,
wherever
I
go
,
or
whatever
become
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
we
go
to
bed
;
and
I
never
wake
till
'
twas
time
to
rise
;
which
I
do
as
blithe
as
a
bird
,
and
go
about
my
business
with
great
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
believe
my
master
be
fearfully
angry
with
me
;
for
he
pass
by
me
two
or
three
time
,
and
would
not
speak
to
me
;
and
towards
evening
,
he
meet
me
in
the
passage
,
go
into
the
garden
,
and
say
such
a
word
to
me
as
I
never
hear
in
my
life
from
him
to
man
,
woman
,
or
child
;
for
he
first
say
,
this
creature
be
always
in
the
way
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
stand
up
as
close
as
I
could
,
(
and
the
entry
be
wide
enough
for
a
coach
too
,
)
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
long
in
your
honour
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
d
 
mn
you
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
(
that
be
the
hard
word
,
)
for
a
little
witch
;
I
have
no
patience
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
profess
I
tremble
to
hear
him
say
so
<EOS>
;
but
I
see
he
be
vex
;
and
,
as
I
be
go
away
,
I
mind
it
the
less
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
see
,
<EOS>
my
dear
parent
,
that
when
a
person
will
do
wicked
thing
,
it
be
no
wonder
he
will
speak
wicked
word
.
 
<EOS>
May
God
keep
me
out
of
the
way
of
them
both
!
                                            
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
Our
John
have
an
opportunity
to
go
your
way
,
I
write
again
,
and
send
both
letter
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
yet
,
when
I
shall
get
away
,
nor
how
I
shall
come
,
because
Mrs.
Jervis
shew
my
master
the
waistcoat
I
be
flower
for
him
,
and
he
say
,
It
look
well
enough
:
I
think
the
creature
have
good
stay
till
she
have
finish
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
private
talk
carry
on
betwixt
him
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
she
do
not
tell
me
of
;
but
yet
she
be
very
kind
to
me
,
and
I
do
not
mistrust
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
base
if
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
be
sure
she
must
oblige
him
,
and
keep
all
his
lawful
command
;
and
other
,
I
dare
say
,
she
will
not
keep
:
<EOS>
She
be
too
good
;
and
love
me
too
well
;
but
she
must
stay
when
I
be
go
,
and
so
must
get
no
ill
will
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
at
me
again
to
ask
to
stay
,
and
humble
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
have
I
do
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
say
I
:
if
I
have
be
a
sauce
-
box
,
and
a
bold
-
face
,
and
a
pert
,
and
a
creature
,
as
he
call
me
,
have
I
not
have
reason
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
should
ever
have
forget
myself
,
if
he
have
not
forget
to
act
as
my
master
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
from
your
own
heart
,
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
if
you
think
I
could
stay
and
be
safe
:
what
would
you
think
,
or
how
would
you
act
in
my
case
?
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Pamela
,
say
she
,
and
kiss
me
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
how
I
should
act
,
or
what
I
should
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
should
act
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
nobody
else
that
would
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
be
a
fine
gentleman
;
he
have
a
great
deal
of
wit
and
sense
,
and
be
admire
,
as
I
know
,
by
half
a
dozen
lady
,
who
would
think
themselves
happy
in
his
address
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
noble
estate
;
and
yet
I
believe
he
love
my
good
maiden
,
though
his
servant
,
well
than
all
the
lady
in
the
land
;
and
he
have
try
to
overcome
it
,
because
you
be
so
much
his
inferior
;
and
'
tis
my
opinion
<EOS>
he
find
he
can
not
;
and
that
vex
his
proud
heart
,
and
make
him
resolve
you
shall
not
stay
;
and
so
he
speak
<EOS>
so
cross
to
you
,
when
he
see
you
by
accident
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
let
me
ask
you
,
if
he
can
stoop
to
like
such
a
poor
girl
as
me
,
as
perhaps
he
may
,
(
for
I
have
read
of
thing
almost
as
strange
,
from
great
man
to
poor
damsel
,
)
<EOS>
what
can
it
be
for
?
  
<EOS>
He
may
condescend
,
perhaps
,
to
think
I
may
be
good
enough
for
his
harlot
;
and
those
thing
do
not
disgrace
man
that
ruin
poor
woman
,
as
the
world
go
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
if
I
be
wicked
enough
,
he
would
keep
me
till
I
be
undone
,
and
till
his
mind
change
;
for
even
wicked
man
,
I
have
read
,
soon
grow
weary
of
wickedness
with
the
same
person
,
and
love
variety
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
poor
Pamela
must
be
turn
off
,
and
look
upon
as
a
vile
abandon
creature
,
and
every
body
would
despise
her
;
ay
,
and
justly
too
,
Mrs.
Jervis
;
for
she
that
can
not
keep
her
virtue
,
ought
to
live
in
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
continue
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
I
hope
,
if
I
be
sure
he
would
always
be
kind
to
me
,
and
never
turn
me
off
at
all
,
that
I
shall
have
so
much
grace
,
as
to
hate
and
withstand
his
temptation
,
be
he
not
only
my
master
,
but
my
king
:
and
that
for
the
sin
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
this
my
poor
dear
parent
have
always
teach
me
;
and
I
should
be
a
sad
wicked
creature
indeed
,
if
,
for
the
sake
of
rich
or
favour
,
I
should
forfeit
my
good
name
;
yea
,
and
bad
than
any
other
young
body
of
my
sex
;
because
I
can
so
contentedly
return
to
my
poverty
again
,
and
think
it
a
less
disgrace
to
be
oblige
to
wear
rag
,
and
live
upon
rye
-
bread
and
water
,
as
I
use
to
do
,
than
to
be
a
harlot
to
the
great
man
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
lift
up
her
hand
,
and
have
her
eye
full
of
tear
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
love
!
<EOS>
say
she
;
you
be
my
admiration
and
delight
.
  
<EOS>
how
shall
I
do
to
part
with
you
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
let
me
ask
you
now
:
 
You
and
<EOS>
he
have
have
some
talk
,
and
you
may
not
be
suffer
to
tell
me
all
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
do
you
think
,
if
I
be
to
ask
to
stay
,
that
he
be
sorry
for
what
he
have
do
?
 
<EOS>
ay
,
and
ashamed
of
it
too
?
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
sure
he
ought
,
consider
his
high
degree
,
and
my
low
degree
,
and
how
I
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
trust
to
<EOS>
but
my
honesty
:
<EOS>
do
you
think
in
your
own
conscience
now
,
(
pray
answer
me
truly
,
)
<EOS>
that
he
would
never
offer
any
thing
to
me
again
,
and
that
I
could
be
safe
?
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
child
,
say
she
,
do
not
put
thy
home
question
to
me
,
with
that
pretty
become
earnestness
in
thy
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
,
that
he
be
vex
at
what
he
have
do
;
he
be
vex
the
first
time
,
more
vex
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
say
I
,
and
so
he
will
be
vex
,
I
suppose
,
the
third
,
and
the
fourth
time
too
,
till
he
have
quite
ruin
your
poor
maiden
;
and
who
will
have
cause
to
be
vex
then
?
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
Pamela
,
say
she
,
do
not
imagine
that
I
would
be
accessory
to
your
ruin
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
can
say
,
that
he
have
,
yet
,
do
you
no
hurt
;
and
it
be
no
wonder
he
should
love
you
<EOS>
,
you
be
so
pretty
;
though
so
much
beneath
him
<EOS>
but
,
I
dare
swear
for
him
,
he
never
will
offer
you
any
force
.
  
<EOS>
You
say
,
say
I
,
that
he
be
sorry
for
his
first
offer
in
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
well
,
and
how
long
do
his
sorrow
last
?
 
<EOS>
only
till
he
find
me
by
myself
;
and
then
he
be
bad
than
before
:
and
so
become
sorry
again
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
have
deign
to
love
me
,
and
you
say
can
not
help
it
,
why
,
he
can
not
help
it
neither
,
if
he
should
have
an
opportunity
,
a
third
time
to
distress
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
read
that
many
a
man
have
be
ashamed
of
his
wicked
attempt
,
when
he
have
be
repulse
,
that
would
never
have
be
ashamed
of
them
,
have
he
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
he
really
intend
to
offer
no
force
,
what
do
that
mean
?
 
<EOS>
while
you
say
he
can
not
help
like
me
,
for
love
it
can
not
be
 
<EOS>
do
it
not
imply
that
he
hope
to
ruin
me
by
my
own
consent
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
say
I
,
(
<EOS>
and
hope
I
should
have
grace
to
do
so
,
)
that
I
should
not
give
way
to
his
temptation
on
any
account
;
but
it
would
be
very
presumptuous
in
me
to
rely
upon
my
own
strength
against
a
gentleman
of
his
qualification
and
estate
,
and
who
be
my
waster
;
and
think
himself
entitled
to
call
me
bold
-
face
,
and
what
not
?
<EOS>
only
for
stand
on
my
necessary
defence
:
and
that
,
too
,
where
the
good
of
my
soul
and
body
,
and
my
duty
to
God
,
and
my
parent
,
be
all
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
how
then
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
can
I
ask
or
wish
to
stay
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
say
she
;
as
he
seem
very
desirous
you
should
not
stay
,
I
hope
it
be
from
a
good
motive
;
for
fear
he
should
be
tempt
to
disgrace
himself
as
well
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
;
I
have
think
of
that
too
;
for
I
would
be
glad
to
consider
him
with
that
duty
that
become
me
:
<EOS>
but
then
he
would
have
let
me
go
to
Lady
Davers
,
and
not
have
hinder
my
preferment
:
and
he
would
not
have
say
,
I
should
return
to
my
poverty
and
distress
,
when
,
by
his
mother
's
goodness
,
I
have
be
lift
out
of
it
;
but
that
he
intend
to
fright
me
,
and
punish
me
,
as
he
think
,
for
not
comply
with
his
wickedness
:
<EOS>
and
this
shew
me
<EOS>
well
enough
what
I
have
to
expect
from
his
future
goodness
,
except
I
will
deserve
it
at
his
own
dear
price
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
silent
;
and
I
add
,
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
no
more
to
be
say
;
I
must
go
<EOS>
,
that
be
certain
:
all
my
concern
will
be
how
to
part
with
you
:
and
,
indeed
,
after
you
,
with
every
body
;
for
all
my
fellow
-
servant
have
love
me
,
and
you
and
they
will
cost
me
a
sigh
,
and
a
tear
too
,
now
and
then
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
fall
a
crying
:
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
one
to
be
in
a
house
among
a
great
many
fellow
-
servant
,
and
be
beloved
by
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
should
have
tell
you
before
now
,
how
kind
and
civil
Mr.
Longman
our
steward
be
;
vastly
courteous
,
indeed
,
on
all
occasion
!
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
once
to
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
,
he
wish
he
be
a
young
man
for
my
sake
;
I
should
be
his
wife
,
and
he
would
settle
all
he
have
upon
me
on
marriage
;
and
,
you
must
know
,
he
be
reckon
worth
a
power
of
money
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
no
pride
in
this
;
but
bless
God
,
and
your
good
example
,
my
dear
parent
,
that
I
have
be
enable
so
to
carry
myself
,
as
to
have
every
body
's
good
word
;
<EOS>
not
but
our
cook
one
day
,
who
be
a
little
snappish
and
cross
sometimes
,
say
once
to
me
,
why
this
Pamela
of
our
go
as
fine
as
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
see
what
it
be
to
have
a
fine
face
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
the
girl
will
come
to
at
last
!
  
<EOS>
She
be
hot
with
her
work
;
and
I
sneak
away
;
for
I
seldom
go
down
into
the
kitchen
;
and
I
hear
the
butler
say
,
why
,
Jane
,
nobody
have
your
good
word
:
what
have
Mrs.
Pamela
do
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
offend
nobody
.
<EOS>
and
what
,
say
the
peevish
wench
,
have
I
say
to
her
,
foolatum
;
but
that
she
be
pretty
?
 
<EOS>
They
quarrel
afterwards
<EOS>
,
I
hear
:
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
but
trouble
myself
no
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
forgive
this
silly
prattle
,
from
                                            
Your
dutiful
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
say
,
that
I
would
stay
to
finish
the
waistcoat
,
if
I
may
with
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
tell
me
I
certainly
may
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
do
a
pretty
piece
of
work
;
and
I
be
up
early
and
late
to
get
it
over
;
for
I
long
to
be
with
you
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
do
not
send
my
last
letter
so
soon
as
I
hope
,
because
John
(
whether
my
master
mistrust
or
no
,
I
can
not
say
)
have
be
send
to
Lady
Davers
's
instead
of
Isaac
,
who
use
to
go
;
and
I
could
not
be
so
free
with
,
nor
so
well
trust
Isaac
;
though
he
be
very
civil
to
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
force
to
stay
till
John
return
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
may
not
have
opportunity
to
send
again
soon
,
and
yet
,
as
I
know
you
keep
my
letter
,
and
read
them
over
and
over
,
(
so
John
tell
me
,
)
when
you
have
do
work
,
(
so
much
do
your
kindness
make
you
love
all
that
come
from
your
poor
daughter
,
)
and
as
it
may
be
some
little
pleasure
to
me
,
perhaps
,
to
read
them
myself
,
when
I
be
come
to
you
,
to
remind
me
of
what
I
have
go
through
,
and
how
great
God
's
goodness
have
be
to
me
,
(
which
,
I
hope
,
will
further
strengthen
my
good
resolution
,
that
I
may
not
hereafter
,
from
my
bad
conduct
,
have
reason
to
condemn
myself
from
my
own
hand
as
it
be
)
:
<EOS>
for
all
these
reason
,
I
say
,
I
will
write
as
I
have
time
,
and
as
matter
happen
,
and
send
the
scribble
to
you
as
I
have
opportunity
;
and
if
I
do
not
every
time
,
in
form
,
subscribe
as
I
ought
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
you
will
always
believe
,
that
it
be
not
for
want
of
duty
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
begin
where
I
leave
off
,
about
the
talk
between
Mrs.
Jervis
and
me
,
for
me
to
ask
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
unknown
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
put
a
project
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
in
practice
.
<EOS>
I
think
with
myself
some
day
ago
,
here
I
shall
go
home
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
,
and
have
nothing
on
my
back
,
that
will
be
fit
for
my
condition
;
for
how
should
your
poor
daughter
look
with
a
silk
night
-
gown
,
silken
petticoat
,
cambric
head
-
clothe
,
fine
holland
linen
,
lace
shoe
that
be
my
lady
's
;
and
fine
stocking
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
in
a
little
while
must
these
have
look
,
like
old
cast
-
off
,
indeed
,
and
I
look
so
for
wear
them
!
 
<EOS>
and
people
would
have
say
,
(
for
poor
folk
be
envious
as
well
as
rich
,
)
<EOS>
see
there
Goody
Andrews
's
daughter
,
turn
home
from
her
fine
place
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
tawdry
figure
she
make
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
well
that
garb
become
her
poor
parent
'
circumstance
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
would
they
look
upon
me
,
think
I
to
myself
,
when
they
should
come
to
be
threadbare
and
wear
out
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
should
I
look
,
even
if
I
could
purchase
homespun
clothe
,
to
dwindle
into
them
one
by
one
,
as
I
get
them
?
 
<EOS>
May
be
,
an
old
silk
gown
,
and
a
linsey
-
woolsey
petticoat
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
think
<EOS>
I
,
I
have
better
get
myself
at
once
equip
in
the
dress
that
will
become
my
condition
;
and
though
it
may
look
but
poor
to
what
I
have
be
use
to
wear
of
late
day
,
yet
it
will
serve
me
,
when
I
be
with
you
,
for
a
good
holiday
and
Sunday
suit
;
and
what
,
by
a
blessing
on
my
industry
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
make
shift
to
keep
up
to
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
as
I
be
say
,
unknown
to
any
body
,
I
buy
of
farmer
Nichols
's
wife
and
daughter
a
good
sad
-
coloured
stuff
,
of
their
own
spinning
,
enough
to
make
me
a
gown
and
two
petticoat
;
and
I
make
robing
and
facing
of
a
pretty
bit
of
print
calico
I
have
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
pretty
good
camblet
quilt
coat
,
that
I
think
may
do
tolerably
well
;
and
I
buy
two
flannel
undercoat
;
not
so
good
as
my
swanskin
and
fine
linen
one
,
but
what
will
keep
me
warm
,
if
any
neighbour
should
get
me
to
go
out
to
help
'em
to
milk
,
now
and
then
,
as
sometimes
I
use
to
do
formerly
;
for
I
be
resolve
to
do
all
your
good
neighbour
what
kindness
I
can
;
and
hope
to
make
myself
as
much
beloved
about
you
,
as
I
be
here
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
some
pretty
good
Scotch
cloth
,
and
make
me
,
of
morning
and
night
,
when
nobody
see
me
,
two
shift
;
and
I
have
enough
leave
for
two
shirt
,
and
two
shift
,
for
you
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
home
,
I
will
make
them
for
you
,
and
desire
your
acceptance
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
buy
of
a
pedlar
,
two
pretty
enough
round
-
eared
cap
,
a
little
straw
-
hat
,
and
a
pair
of
knit
mittens
,
turn
up
with
white
calico
;
and
two
pair
of
ordinary
blue
worsted
hose
,
that
make
a
smartish
appearance
,
with
white
clock
,
I
will
assure
you
;
and
two
yard
of
black
riband
for
my
shift
sleeve
,
and
to
serve
as
a
necklace
;
and
when
I
have
'em
all
come
home
,
I
go
and
look
upon
them
once
in
two
hour
,
for
two
day
together
:
<EOS>
for
,
you
must
know
,
though
I
be
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
keep
my
own
little
apartment
still
for
my
clothe
,
and
nobody
go
thither
but
myself
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
say
I
be
no
bad
housewife
to
have
save
so
much
money
;
but
my
dear
good
lady
be
always
give
me
something
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
myself
the
more
obliged
to
do
this
,
because
,
as
I
be
turn
away
for
what
my
good
master
think
want
of
duty
;
and
as
he
expect
other
return
for
his
present
,
than
I
intend
to
make
him
,
so
I
think
it
be
but
just
to
leave
his
present
behind
me
when
I
go
away
;
for
,
you
know
,
if
I
would
not
earn
his
wage
,
why
should
I
have
them
?
  
<EOS>
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
the
four
guinea
,
nor
borrow
to
make
them
up
;
for
they
be
give
me
,
with
some
silver
,
as
I
tell
you
,
as
a
perquisite
,
be
what
my
lady
have
about
her
when
she
die
;
and
,
as
I
hope
for
no
wage
,
I
be
so
vain
as
to
think
I
have
deserve
all
that
money
in
the
fourteen
month
,
since
my
lady
's
death
,
for
she
,
good
soul
,
overpay
me
before
,
in
learning
and
other
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
have
she
live
,
none
of
these
thing
may
have
happen
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
be
thankful
'
tis
<EOS>
no
bad
.
 
<EOS>
every
thing
will
turn
about
for
the
good
:
that
be
my
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
as
I
be
say
,
I
have
provide
a
new
and
more
suitable
dress
,
and
I
long
to
appear
in
it
,
more
than
ever
I
do
in
any
new
clothe
in
my
life
:
for
then
I
shall
be
soon
after
with
you
,
and
at
ease
in
my
mind
 
<EOS>
but
,
mum
!
 
<EOS>
here
he
come
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
etc
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
be
force
to
break
off
:
for
I
fear
my
master
be
come
:
but
it
prove
to
be
only
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
I
can
not
endure
you
should
be
so
much
by
yourself
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
,
say
I
,
dread
nothing
so
much
as
company
;
for
my
heart
be
up
at
my
mouth
now
,
for
fear
my
master
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
always
rejoice
to
see
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
say
she
,
I
have
have
a
world
of
talk
with
my
master
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
say
I
,
that
I
be
make
of
so
much
consequence
as
to
be
talk
of
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
say
she
,
I
must
not
tell
you
all
;
but
you
be
of
more
consequence
to
him
than
you
think
for
     
or
wish
for
,
say
I
;
for
the
fruit
of
be
of
consequence
to
him
,
would
make
me
of
none
to
myself
,
or
any
body
else
.
  
<EOS>
say
she
,
Thou
art
as
witty
as
any
lady
in
the
land
;
I
wonder
where
thou
gottest
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
must
be
poor
lady
,
with
such
great
opportunity
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
if
they
have
no
more
wit
than
i.
 
but
let
that
pass
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
say
I
,
that
I
be
of
so
much
consequence
,
however
,
as
to
vex
him
,
if
it
be
but
to
think
he
can
not
make
a
fool
of
such
a
one
as
I
;
and
that
be
nothing
at
all
,
but
a
rebuke
to
the
pride
of
his
high
condition
,
which
he
do
not
expect
,
and
know
not
how
to
put
up
with
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
that
,
may
be
,
say
she
:
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
Pamela
,
he
be
very
angry
with
you
too
;
and
call
you
twenty
perverse
thing
;
wonder
at
his
own
folly
,
to
have
shew
you
so
much
favour
,
as
he
call
it
;
which
he
be
first
inclined
to
,
he
say
,
for
his
mother
's
sake
,
and
would
have
persist
to
shew
you
for
your
own
,
if
you
be
not
your
own
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
now
I
shall
not
love
you
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
;
you
be
go
to
persuade
me
to
ask
to
stay
,
though
you
know
the
hazard
I
run
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
,
he
say
you
shall
go
;
for
he
think
it
will
not
be
for
his
reputation
to
keep
you
:
but
he
wish
(
do
not
speak
of
it
for
the
world
,
Pamela
,
)
that
he
know
a
lady
of
birth
,
just
such
another
as
yourself
,
in
person
and
mind
,
and
he
would
marry
her
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
I
colour
up
to
the
ear
at
this
word
:
but
say
,
<EOS>
yet
,
if
I
be
the
lady
of
birth
,
and
he
would
offer
to
be
rude
first
,
as
he
have
twice
do
to
poor
me
,
I
do
not
know
whether
I
would
have
him
:
<EOS>
for
she
that
can
bear
an
insult
of
that
kind
,
I
should
think
not
worthy
to
be
a
gentleman
's
wife
:
any
more
than
he
would
be
a
gentleman
that
would
offer
it
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
now
,
Pamela
,
say
she
,
thou
carriest
thy
notion
a
great
way
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
very
seriously
,
for
I
could
not
help
it
,
I
be
more
full
of
fear
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
beg
of
you
,
as
one
of
the
good
friend
I
have
in
the
world
,
to
say
nothing
of
my
asking
to
stay
.
<EOS>
to
say
my
master
like
me
,
when
I
know
what
end
he
aim
at
,
be
abomination
to
my
ear
;
and
I
shall
not
think
myself
safe
till
I
be
at
my
poor
father
's
and
<EOS>
mother
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
angry
with
me
,
till
I
assure
her
that
I
have
not
the
least
uneasiness
on
her
account
,
but
think
myself
safe
under
her
protection
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
dropt
the
discourse
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
to
have
finish
this
ugly
waistcoat
in
two
day
;
after
which
I
have
only
some
linen
to
get
up
,
and
shall
then
let
you
know
how
I
contrive
as
to
my
passage
;
for
the
heavy
rain
will
make
it
sad
travel
on
foot
:
but
may
be
I
may
get
a
place
to
which
be
ten
mile
of
the
way
,
in
farmer
Nichols
's
close
cart
;
for
I
can
not
sit
a
horse
well
at
all
,
and
may
be
nobody
will
be
suffer
to
see
me
on
upon
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
to
let
you
know
more
.
           
<EOS>
from
,
etc
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
all
my
fellow
-
servant
have
now
some
notion
that
I
be
to
go
away
;
but
can
not
imagine
for
what
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
tell
them
,
that
my
father
and
mother
,
grow
in
year
,
can
not
live
without
me
;
and
so
I
go
home
to
them
,
to
help
to
comfort
their
old
age
;
but
they
seem
not
to
believe
it
.
  
<EOS>
what
they
find
it
out
by
be
;
the
butler
hear
him
say
to
me
,
as
I
pass
by
him
,
in
the
entry
lead
to
the
hall
,
<EOS>
who
be
that
?
 
<EOS>
Pamela
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
Pamela
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
how
long
be
you
to
stay
here
?
 
<EOS>
only
,
please
your
honour
,
say
I
,
till
I
have
do
the
waistcoat
;
and
it
be
almost
finish
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
,
say
he
,
(
very
roughly
indeed
,
)
have
finish
that
long
enough
ago
,
I
should
have
think
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
and
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
I
have
work
early
and
late
upon
it
;
there
be
a
great
deal
of
work
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
work
in
it
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
<EOS>
You
mind
your
pen
more
than
your
needle
;
I
do
not
want
such
idle
slut
to
stay
in
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
seem
startled
,
when
he
see
the
butler
,
as
he
enter
the
hall
,
where
Mr.
Jonathan
stand
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
here
?
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
the
butler
be
as
much
confound
as
I
;
for
,
never
have
be
tax
so
roughly
,
I
could
not
help
cry
sadly
;
and
get
out
of
both
their
way
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
tell
my
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
this
love
,
say
she
,
be
the
d
#
#
#
#
!
 
<EOS>
in
how
many
strange
shape
do
it
make
people
shew
themselves
!
 
<EOS>
and
in
some
the
farth
from
their
heart
.
  
<EOS>
so
one
,
and
then
another
,
have
be
since
whisper
,
Pray
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
be
we
to
lose
Mrs.
Pamela
?
<EOS>
as
they
always
call
me
 
<EOS>
what
have
she
do
?
<EOS>
and
she
tell
them
,
as
above
,
about
go
home
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
afterwards
to
me
,
well
,
Pamela
,
you
have
make
our
master
,
from
the
sweetest
temper
gentleman
in
the
world
,
one
of
the
most
peevish
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
make
him
as
sweet
-
tempered
as
ever
;
though
I
hope
you
will
never
do
it
on
his
term
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
good
in
Mrs.
Jervis
;
but
it
intimate
,
that
she
think
as
ill
of
his
design
as
I
;
and
as
she
know
his
mind
more
than
I
,
it
convince
me
that
I
ought
to
get
away
as
fast
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
come
in
,
just
now
,
to
speak
to
Mrs.
Jervis
about
household
matter
,
have
some
company
to
dine
with
him
to
-
morrow
;
and
I
stand
up
,
and
have
be
cry
at
his
roughness
in
the
entry
,
I
turn
away
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
well
,
say
he
,
turn
away
your
cursed
face
<EOS>
;
I
wish
I
have
never
see
it
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
how
long
be
she
to
be
about
this
waistcoat
?
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
if
your
honour
have
please
,
I
would
have
take
it
with
me
;
and
though
it
would
be
now
finish
in
a
few
hour
,
I
will
do
so
still
;
and
remove
this
hate
poor
Pamela
out
of
your
house
and
sight
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
he
,
not
speak
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
believe
this
little
slut
have
the
power
of
witchcraft
,
if
ever
there
be
a
witch
;
for
she
enchant
all
that
come
near
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
even
you
,
who
should
know
better
what
the
world
be
,
think
her
an
angel
of
light
.
  
<EOS>
I
offer
to
go
away
;
for
I
believe
he
want
me
to
ask
to
stay
in
my
place
,
for
all
this
his
great
wrath
:
and
he
say
,
stay
here
!
 
<EOS>
stay
here
,
when
I
bid
you
!
<EOS>
and
snatch
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
,
and
say
,
I
will
!
<EOS>
I
will
!
<EOS>
for
he
hurt
my
finger
,
he
grasp
me
so
hard
.
  
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
a
mind
to
say
something
to
me
;
but
break
off
abruptly
,
and
say
,
Begone
!
 
<EOS>
and
away
I
trip
as
fast
as
I
could
:
and
he
and
Mrs.
Jervis
have
a
deal
of
talk
,
as
she
tell
me
;
and
among
the
rest
,
he
express
himself
vexed
to
have
speak
in
Mr.
Jonathan
's
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
now
you
must
know
,
that
Mr.
Jonathan
,
our
butler
,
be
a
very
grave
good
sort
of
old
man
,
with
his
hair
as
white
as
silver
!
<EOS>
and
an
honest
worthy
man
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
hurry
out
with
a
flea
in
my
ear
,
as
the
saying
be
,
and
go
down
stair
into
the
parlour
,
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
hold
of
my
hand
(
in
a
gentle
manner
,
though
,
than
my
master
)
with
both
his
;
and
he
say
,
ah
!
<EOS>
sweet
,
sweet
Mrs.
Pamela
!
<EOS>
what
be
it
<EOS>
I
hear
<EOS>
but
just
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
at
my
heart
;
but
I
be
sure
I
will
sooner
believe
any
body
in
fault
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
Mr.
Jonathan
,
say
I
;
but
as
you
value
your
place
,
do
not
be
see
speak
to
such
a
one
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
cry
too
;
and
slipt
away
as
fast
as
I
could
from
him
,
for
his
own
sake
,
lest
he
should
be
see
to
pity
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
will
give
you
an
instance
how
much
I
be
in
Mr.
Longman
's
esteem
also
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
lose
my
pen
<EOS>
some
<EOS>
how
;
and
my
paper
be
write
out
,
I
step
to
Mr.
Longman
's
,
our
steward
's
,
office
,
to
beg
him
to
give
me
a
pen
or
two
,
and
a
sheet
or
two
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,

that
I
will

my
sweet
maiden
!
<EOS>
and
give
me
three
pen
,
some
wafer
,
a
stick
of
wax
,
and
twelve
sheet
of
paper
;
and
come
from
his
desk
,
where
he
be
write
,
he
say
,
let
me
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
,
my
sweet
little
mistress
:
(
for
so
these
two
good
old
gentleman
often
call
me
;
for
I
believe
they
love
me
dearly
:
)
<EOS>
I
hear
bad
news
;
that
we
be
go
to
lose
you
<EOS>
:
I
hope
it
be
not
true
.
 
<EOS>
yes
it
be
,
sir
,
say
I
;
but
I
be
in
hope
it
would
not
be
know
till
I
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
d####l
,
say
he
,
ail
our
master
of
late
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
an
alteration
in
any
man
in
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
with
nobody
as
I
see
;
and
by
what
Mr.
Jonathan
tell
me
just
now
,
he
be
quite
out
of
the
way
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
you
have
do
to
him
,
tro
'
?
 
<EOS>
only
Mrs.
Jervis
be
a
very
good
woman
,
or
I
should
have
fear
she
have
be
your
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
no
,
say
I
,
nothing
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
be
a
just
good
woman
;
and
,
next
to
my
father
and
mother
,
the
good
friend
I
have
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
say
he
,
it
must
be
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
guess
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
too
pretty
,
my
sweet
mistress
,
and
,
may
be
,
too
virtuous
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
have
I
not
hit
it
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
good
Mr.
Longman
,
say
I
,
do
not
think
any
thing
amiss
of
my
master
;
he
be
cross
and
angry
with
me
indeed
,
that
be
true
;
but
I
may
have
give
occasion
for
it
,
possibly
;
and
because
I
be
desirous
to
go
to
my
father
and
mother
,
rather
than
stay
here
,
perhaps
he
may
think
me
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
but
,
you
know
,
sir
,
say
I
,
that
a
father
and
mother
's
comfort
be
the
dear
thing
to
a
good
child
that
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
sweet
excellence
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
this
become
you
;
but
I
know
the
world
and
mankind
too
well
;
though
I
must
hear
,
and
see
,
and
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
a
blessing
attend
my
little
sweeting
,
say
he
,
wherever
you
go
!
 
<EOS>
and
away
go
I
with
a
courtesy
and
thank
.
  
<EOS>
now
this
please
one
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
to
be
so
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
how
much
better
,
by
good
fame
and
integrity
,
be
it
to
get
every
one
's
good
word
but
one
,
than
,
by
please
that
one
,
to
make
every
one
else
one
's
enemy
,
and
be
an
execrable
creature
besides
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
etc
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
We
have
a
great
many
neighbouring
gentleman
,
and
their
lady
,
this
day
,
at
dinner
;
and
my
master
make
a
fine
entertainment
for
them
:
and
Isaac
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
,
and
Benjamin
,
wait
at
table
:
<EOS>
and
Isaac
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
the
lady
will
by
and
by
come
to
see
the
house
,
and
have
the
curiosity
to
see
me
<EOS>
;
for
,
it
seem
,
they
say
to
my
master
,
when
the
joke
fly
about
,
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
we
understand
you
have
a
servant
-
maid
,
who
be
the
great
beauty
in
the
county
;
and
we
promise
ourselves
to
see
her
before
we
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
wench
be
well
enough
,
say
he
;
but
no
such
beauty
as
you
talk
of
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
ye
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
,
who
,
on
her
death
-
bed
,
engage
me
to
be
kind
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
young
,
and
every
thing
be
pretty
that
be
young
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
say
one
of
the
lady
,
that
be
true
;
but
if
your
mother
have
not
recommend
her
so
strongly
,
there
be
so
much
merit
in
beauty
,
that
I
make
no
doubt
such
a
fine
gentleman
would
have
want
no
inducement
to
be
kind
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
laugh
at
my
master
:
<EOS>
and
he
,
it
seem
,
laugh
for
company
;
but
say
,
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
I
see
with
different
eye
from
other
people
;
for
I
have
hear
much
more
talk
of
her
prettiness
,
than
I
think
it
deserve
<EOS>
:
She
be
well
enough
,
as
I
say
:
but
her
great
excellence
be
,
that
she
be
humble
,
and
courteous
,
and
faithful
,
and
make
all
her
fellow
-
servant
love
her
:
My
housekeeper
,
in
particular
,
doat
upon
her
;
and
you
know
,
lady
,
she
be
a
woman
of
discernment
:
<EOS>
and
,
as
for
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Jonathan
,
here
,
if
they
think
themselves
young
enough
,
I
be
tell
,
they
would
fight
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
true
,
Jonathan
?
 
<EOS>
Troth
,
sir
,
say
he
,
an't
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
I
never
know
her
peer
,
and
all
your
honour
's
family
be
of
the
same
mind
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
hear
now
?
<EOS>
say
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
the
lady
,
we
will
make
a
visit
to
Mrs.
Jervis
by
and
by
,
and
hope
to
see
this
paragon
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
they
be
come
;
and
will
tell
you
the
rest
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
they
have
come
,
and
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
why
can
not
they
make
their
game
without
me
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
these
fine
lady
have
be
here
,
and
be
go
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
be
absent
,
if
I
could
,
and
do
step
into
the
closet
:
so
they
see
me
when
they
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
four
of
them
,
Lady
Arthur
at
the
great
white
house
on
the
hill
,
Lady
Brooks
,
Lady
Towers
,
and
the
other
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
a
countess
,
of
some
hard
name
<EOS>
,
I
forget
what
.
  
<EOS>
so
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
one
of
the
lady
,
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
come
to
inquire
after
your
health
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
oblige
to
your
ladyship
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
:
<EOS>
Will
your
ladyship
please
to
sit
down
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
the
countess
,
we
be
not
only
come
to
ask
after
Mrs.
Jervis
's
health
neither
;
but
we
be
come
to
see
a
rarity
besides
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
say
Lady
Arthur
,
I
have
not
see
your
Pamela
these
two
year
,
and
they
tell
me
she
be
grow
wondrous
pretty
in
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
wish
I
have
not
be
in
the
closet
;
for
when
I
come
out
,
they
must
needs
<EOS>
know
<EOS>
I
hear
them
;
but
I
have
often
find
,
that
bashful
body
owe
themselves
a
spite
,
and
frequently
confound
themselves
more
,
by
endeavour
to
avoid
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
yes
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Pamela
be
very
pretty
indeed
;
she
be
but
in
the
closet
there
:
 
Pamela
,
pray
step
hither
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
out
all
cover
with
blush
,
and
they
smile
at
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
the
countess
take
me
by
the
hand
:
why
,
indeed
,
she
be
pleased
to
say
,
report
have
not
be
too
lavish
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
ashamed
,
child
;
(
and
stare
full
in
my
face
;
)
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
just
such
a
face
to
be
ashamed
of
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
like
a
fool
I
look
!
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arthur
say
,
ay
,
my
good
Pamela
,
I
say
as
her
ladyship
say
:
do
not
be
so
confused
;
though
,
indeed
,
it
become
you
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
your
good
lady
depart
make
a
sweet
choice
of
such
a
pretty
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
mighty
proud
of
you
,
as
she
always
be
praise
you
,
have
she
live
till
now
.
  
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
madam
<EOS>
,
say
Lady
Brooks
,
do
you
think
that
so
dutiful
a
son
as
our
neighbour
,
who
always
admire
what
his
mother
love
,
do
not
pride
himself
,
for
all
what
he
say
at
table
,
in
such
a
pretty
maiden
?
  
<EOS>
She
look
with
such
a
malicious
sneering
countenance
,
I
can
not
abide
her
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
say
with
a
free
air
,
(
for
it
seem
she
be
call
a
wit
,
)
<EOS>
well
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
I
can
not
say
I
like
you
so
well
as
these
lady
do
;
for
I
should
never
care
,
if
you
be
my
servant
,
to
have
you
and
your
master
in
the
same
house
together
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
all
set
up
a
great
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
could
have
say
,
if
I
durst
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
lady
 
and
<EOS>
lady
may
say
any
thing
.
  
<EOS>
say
Lady
Towers
,
<EOS>
Can
the
pretty
image
speak
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
 
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
she
have
speak
eye
!
 
<EOS>
o
you
little
rogue
,
say
she
,
and
tap
me
on
the
cheek
,
you
seem
bear
to
undo
,
or
to
be
undo
!
  
<EOS>
God
forbid
,
and
please
your
ladyship
,
say
I
,
it
should
be
either
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
,
say
I
,
to
withdraw
;
for
the
sense
I
have
of
my
unworthiness
render
me
unfit
for
such
a
presence
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
go
away
,
with
one
of
my
good
courtesy
;
and
Lady
Towers
say
,
as
I
go
out
,
<EOS>
prettily
say
,
I
vow
!
 
<EOS>
and
Lady
Brooks
say
,
see
that
shape
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
face
and
shape
in
my
life
;
why
,
she
must
be
better
descend
than
you
have
tell
me
!
  
<EOS>
and
so
they
run
on
for
half
an
hour
more
in
my
praise
,
as
I
be
tell
;
and
glad
be
I
,
when
I
get
out
of
the
hearing
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
it
seem
,
they
go
down
with
such
a
story
to
my
master
,
and
so
full
of
me
,
that
he
have
much
ado
to
stand
it
;
but
as
it
be
very
little
to
my
reputation
,
I
be
sure
I
could
take
no
pride
in
it
;
and
I
fear
it
would
make
no
well
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
give
me
another
cause
for
wish
myself
out
of
this
house
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
Thursday
morning
,
and
next
Thursday
I
hope
to
set
out
;
for
I
have
finish
my
task
,
and
my
master
be
horrid
cross
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
vex
<EOS>
his
crossness
affect
me
so
.
 
<EOS>
if
ever
he
have
any
kindness
towards
me
,
I
believe
he
now
hate
me
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
not
strange
,
that
love
border
so
much
upon
hate
?
 
<EOS>
but
this
wicked
love
be
not
like
the
true
virtuous
love
,
to
be
sure
:
that
and
hatred
must
be
as
far
off
,
as
light
and
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
must
this
hate
have
be
increase
,
if
he
have
meet
with
such
a
base
compliance
,
after
his
wicked
will
have
be
gratify
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
one
may
see
by
a
little
,
what
a
great
deal
mean
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
innocence
can
not
attract
common
civility
,
what
must
guilt
expect
,
when
novelty
have
cease
to
have
its
charm
,
and
changeableness
have
take
place
of
it
?
<EOS>
thus
we
read
in
Holy
Writ
,
that
wicke
Amnon
,
when
he
have
ruin
poor
Tamar
,
hate
her
more
than
he
ever
love
her
,
and
would
have
turn
her
out
of
door
.
  
<EOS>
how
happy
be
I
,
to
be
turn
out
of
door
,
with
that
sweet
companion
my
innocence
!
 
<EOS>
o
may
that
be
always
my
companion
!
 
<EOS>
and
while
I
presume
not
upon
my
own
strength
,
and
be
willing
to
avoid
the
tempter
,
I
hope
the
divine
grace
will
assist
me
.
  
<EOS>
forgive
me
,
that
I
repeat
in
my
letter
part
of
my
hourly
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
I
owe
every
thing
,
next
to
God
's
goodness
,
to
your
piety
and
good
example
,
my
dear
parent
,
my
dear
poor
parent
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
that
word
with
pleasure
;
for
your
poverty
be
my
pride
,
as
your
integrity
shall
he
my
imitation
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
dine
,
I
will
put
on
my
new
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
have
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
surprise
Mrs.
Jervis
with
them
;
for
she
shall
not
see
me
till
I
be
full
dress
.
 
<EOS>
John
be
come
back
,
and
I
will
soon
send
you
some
of
what
I
have
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
be
go
early
in
the
morning
;
and
so
I
will
close
here
,
that
I
be
                                   
Your
most
dutiful
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
lose
your
time
in
meet
me
;
because
I
be
so
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
hard
if
,
some
how
or
other
,
I
can
not
get
a
passage
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
may
be
my
master
will
not
refuse
to
let
John
bring
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
ride
behind
him
,
I
believe
,
well
enough
;
for
he
be
very
careful
,
and
very
honest
;
and
you
know
John
as
well
as
I
;
for
he
love
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
may
be
,
Mrs.
Jervis
can
put
me
in
some
way
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
shall
write
on
,
as
long
as
I
stay
,
though
I
should
have
nothing
but
silliness
to
write
;
for
I
know
you
divert
yourself
on
night
with
what
I
write
,
because
it
be
mine
.
 
<EOS>
John
tell
me
how
much
you
long
for
my
coming
;
but
he
say
,
he
tell
you
he
hope
something
would
happen
to
hinder
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
do
not
tell
him
the
occasion
of
my
come
away
;
for
if
my
fellow
-
servant
should
guess
,
it
be
well
so
,
than
to
have
it
from
you
or
me
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
really
be
concern
,
that
my
master
should
cast
away
a
thought
upon
such
a
poor
creature
as
me
;
for
,
besides
the
disgrace
,
it
have
quite
turn
his
temper
;
and
I
begin
to
believe
what
Mrs.
Jervis
tell
me
,
that
he
like
me
,
and
can
not
help
it
;
and
yet
strive
to
conquer
it
;
and
so
find
no
way
but
to
be
cross
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
think
me
presumptuous
and
conceited
;
for
it
be
more
my
concern
than
my
pride
,
to
see
such
a
gentleman
so
demean
himself
,
and
lessen
the
regard
he
use
to
have
in
the
eye
of
all
his
servant
,
on
my
account
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
to
tell
you
of
my
new
dress
to
day
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
when
I
have
dine
,
up
<EOS>
stair
<EOS>
I
go
,
and
lock
myself
into
my
little
room
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
trick
myself
up
as
well
as
I
could
in
my
new
garb
,
and
put
on
my
round
-
eared
ordinary
cap
;
but
with
a
green
knot
,
however
,
and
my
homespun
gown
and
petticoat
,
and
plain
leather
shoe
;
but
yet
they
be
what
they
call
spanish
leather
;
and
my
ordinary
hose
,
ordinary
<EOS>
I
mean
to
what
I
have
be
lately
use
to
;
though
I
shall
think
good
yarn
may
do
very
well
for
every
day
,
when
I
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
a
plain
muslin
tucker
I
put
on
,
and
my
black
silk
necklace
,
instead
of
the
french
necklace
my
lady
give
me
;
and
put
the
ear
-
ring
out
of
my
ear
;
and
when
I
be
quite
equipped
,
I
take
my
straw
hat
in
my
hand
,
with
its
two
blue
string
,
and
look
about
me
in
the
glass
,
as
proud
as
any
thing
 
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
I
never
like
myself
so
well
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
o
the
pleasure
of
descend
with
ease
,
innocence
,
and
resignation
!
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
nothing
like
it
!
 
<EOS>
an
humble
mind
,
I
plainly
see
,
can
not
meet
with
any
very
shocking
disappointment
,
let
fortune
's
wheel
turn
round
as
it
will
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
down
to
look
for
Mrs.
Jervis
,
to
see
how
she
like
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
meet
,
as
I
be
upon
the
stair
,
our
Rachel
,
who
be
the
house
-
maid
;
and
she
make
me
a
low
courtesy
,
and
I
find
do
not
know
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
smile
,
and
go
to
the
housekeeper
's
parlour
;
and
there
sit
good
Mrs.
Jervis
at
work
,
make
a
shift
:
and
,
would
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
she
do
not
know
me
at
first
;
but
rise
up
,
and
pull
off
her
spectacle
;
and
say
,
<EOS>
do
you
want
me
,
forsooth
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
laugh
,
and
say
,
Hey
-
day
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
what
!
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
me
?
 
<EOS>
She
stand
all
in
amaze
,
and
look
at
me
from
top
to
toe
:
<EOS>
why
,
you
surprise
me
,
say
she
:
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
Pamela
thus
metamorphose
!
 
<EOS>
how
come
this
about
?
  
<EOS>
as
it
happen
,
in
stept
my
master
;
and
my
back
be
to
him
,
he
think
it
be
a
stranger
speak
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
withdraw
again
:
and
do
not
hear
her
ask
,
if
his
honour
have
any
command
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
She
turn
me
about
and
about
,
and
I
shew
her
all
my
dress
,
to
my
under
-
petticoat
:
and
<EOS>
she
say
,
sit
down
,
why
,
I
be
all
in
amaze
,
I
must
sit
down
.
<EOS>
what
can
all
this
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
I
have
no
clothe
suitable
to
my
condition
when
I
return
to
my
father
's
;
and
so
it
be
well
to
begin
here
,
as
I
be
soon
to
go
away
,
that
all
my
fellow
-
servant
may
see
I
know
how
to
suit
myself
to
the
state
I
be
return
to
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
I
never
know
the
like
of
thee
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
sad
preparation
for
go
away
(
for
now
I
see
you
be
quite
in
earnest
)
be
what
I
know
not
how
to
get
over
.
 
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
Pamela
,
how
can
I
part
with
you
!
  
<EOS>
My
master
ring
in
the
back
-
parlour
,
and
so
I
withdraw
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
go
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
,
he
say
to
her
,
I
be
come
in
to
let
you
know
,
that
I
shall
go
to
Lincolnshire
,
and
possibly
to
my
sister
Davers
's
,
and
be
absent
some
week
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
pray
,
what
pretty
neat
damsel
be
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
smile
,
and
ask
,
if
his
honour
do
not
know
who
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
he
,
I
never
see
her
before
.
 
<EOS>
Farmer
Nichols
,
or
Farmer
Brady
,
have
neither
of
them
such
a
tight
prim
lass
for
a
daughter
!
<EOS>
have
they
?
 
<EOS>
though
I
do
not
see
her
face
neither
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
if
your
honour
will
not
be
angry
,
say
she
,
I
will
introduce
her
into
your
presence
;
for
I
think
,
say
she
,
she
outdo
our
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
do
not
thank
her
for
this
,
as
I
tell
her
afterwards
,
(
for
it
bring
a
great
deal
of
trouble
upon
me
,
as
well
as
crossness
,
as
you
shall
hear
)
.
 
<EOS>
that
can
not
be
,
he
be
pleased
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
can
find
an
excuse
for
it
,
let
her
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
she
stept
to
me
,
and
tell
me
,
I
must
go
in
with
her
to
her
master
;
but
,
say
she
,
for
goodness
'
sake
,
let
him
find
you
out
;
for
he
do
not
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
o
fie
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
how
could
you
serve
me
so
?
<EOS>
besides
,
it
look
too
free
both
in
me
,
and
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
say
she
,
you
shall
come
in
;
and
pray
do
not
reveal
yourself
till
he
find
you
out
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
in
,
foolish
as
I
be
;
though
I
must
have
be
see
by
him
another
time
,
if
I
have
not
then
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
make
me
take
my
straw
hat
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
dropt
a
low
courtesy
,
but
say
never
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
know
me
as
soon
as
he
see
my
face
:
but
be
as
cunning
as
Lucifer
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
up
to
me
,
and
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
whose
pretty
maiden
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
be
Pamela
's
sister
,
you
be
so
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
neat
,
so
clean
,
so
pretty
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
child
,
you
far
surpass
your
sister
Pamela
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
all
confusion
,
and
would
have
speak
:
but
he
take
me
about
the
neck
:
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
you
be
very
pretty
<EOS>
,
child
:
I
would
not
be
so
free
with
your
sister
,
you
may
believe
;
but
I
must
kiss
you
.
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
I
be
Pamela
,
indeed
I
be
:
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
Pamela
,
her
own
self
!
  
<EOS>
He
kiss
me
for
all
I
could
do
;
and
say
,
impossible
!
<EOS>
you
be
a
lovelier
girl
by
half
than
Pamela
;
and
sure
I
may
be
innocently
free
with
you
,
though
I
would
not
do
her
so
much
favour
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
sad
trick
upon
me
,
indeed
,
and
what
I
could
not
expect
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
look
like
a
fool
as
much
as
I
,
for
her
officiousness
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
get
away
,
and
run
out
of
the
parlour
,
most
sadly
vexed
,
as
you
may
well
think
.
  
<EOS>
He
talk
a
good
deal
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
at
last
order
me
to
come
in
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
come
in
,
say
he
,
you
little
villain
!
 
<EOS>
for
so
he
call
me
.
<EOS>
(
Good
sir
!
<EOS>
what
a
name
be
there
!
)
 
<EOS>
who
be
it
<EOS>
you
put
your
trick
upon
?
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
never
to
honour
your
unworthiness
,
say
he
,
with
so
much
notice
again
;
and
so
you
must
disguise
yourself
to
attract
me
,
and
yet
pretend
,
like
an
hypocrite
as
you
be
     
<EOS>
I
be
out
of
patience
then
<EOS>
:
hold
,
good
sir
,
say
I
;
do
not
impute
disguise
and
hypocrisy
to
me
,
above
all
thing
;
for
I
hate
them
both
,
mean
as
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
on
no
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
plague
,
say
he
,
for
that
be
his
word
,
do
you
mean
then
by
this
dress
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
and
please
your
honour
,
say
I
,
I
mean
one
of
the
honest
thing
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
disguise
,
indeed
,
ever
since
my
good
lady
your
mother
take
me
from
my
poor
parent
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
her
ladyship
so
poor
and
mean
,
that
these
clothe
I
have
on
,
be
a
princely
suit
to
those
I
have
then
:
and
her
goodness
heap
upon
me
rich
clothe
,
and
other
bounty
:
<EOS>
and
as
I
be
now
return
to
my
poor
parent
again
so
soon
,
I
can
not
wear
those
good
thing
without
be
hoot
at
;
and
so
have
buy
what
will
be
more
suitable
to
my
degree
,
and
be
a
good
holiday
-
suit
too
,
when
I
get
home
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
take
me
in
his
arm
,
and
presently
push
me
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
he
,
take
the
little
witch
from
me
;
I
can
neither
bear
,
nor
forbear
her
(
strange
word
these
!
)
 
<EOS>
but
stay
;
you
shall
not
go
!
 
<EOS>
yet
begone
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
come
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
mad
,
for
my
share
;
for
he
know
not
what
he
would
have
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
,
however
;
but
he
stept
after
me
,
and
take
hold
of
my
arm
,
and
bring
me
in
again
:
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
make
my
arm
black
and
blue
;
for
the
mark
be
upon
it
still
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
sir
,
say
I
,
pray
have
mercy
;
I
will
,
I
will
come
in
!
  
<EOS>
He
sit
down
,
and
look
at
me
,
and
,
as
I
think
afterwards
,
as
sillily
as
such
a
poor
girl
as
i.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
,
well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
I
be
tell
you
,
you
may
permit
her
to
stay
a
little
longer
,
till
I
see
if
my
sister
daver
will
have
her
;
if
,
mean
time
,
she
humble
herself
,
and
ask
this
as
a
favour
,
and
be
sorry
for
her
pertness
,
and
the
liberty
she
have
take
with
my
character
out
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
indeed
tell
me
so
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
:
<EOS>
but
I
never
find
her
inclinable
to
think
herself
in
a
fault
.
 
<EOS>
pride
and
perverseness
,
say
he
,
with
a
vengeance
!
 
<EOS>
yet
this
be
your
doating
-
piece
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
for
once
,
I
will
submit
myself
to
tell
you
,
hussy
,
say
he
to
me
,
you
may
stay
a
fortnight
longer
,
till
I
see
my
sister
daver
:
do
you
hear
what
I
say
to
you
,
statue
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
neither
speak
nor
be
thankful
?
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
fright
me
so
,
say
I
,
that
I
can
hardly
speak
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
venture
to
say
,
that
I
have
only
to
beg
,
as
a
favour
,
that
I
may
go
to
my
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
why
fool
,
say
he
,
will
not
you
like
to
go
to
wait
on
my
sister
daver
?
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
be
once
fond
of
that
honour
;
but
you
be
pleased
to
say
,
I
may
be
in
danger
from
her
ladyship
's
nephew
,
or
he
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
D####d
impertinence
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
<EOS>
do
you
hear
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
do
you
hear
,
how
she
retort
upon
me
?
 
<EOS>
be
ever
such
matchless
assurance
!
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
  
I
then
fall
a
weeping
;
for
Mrs.
Jervis
say
,
Fie
,
Pamela
,
fie
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
My
lot
be
very
hard
indeed
;
I
be
sure
I
would
hurt
nobody
;
and
I
have
be
,
it
seem
,
guilty
of
indiscretion
,
which
have
cost
me
my
place
,
and
my
master
's
favour
,
and
so
have
be
turn
her
away
:
and
when
the
time
be
come
,
that
I
should
return
to
my
poor
parent
,
I
be
not
suffer
to
go
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
good
your
honour
<EOS>
,
what
have
I
do
,
that
I
must
be
use
bad
than
if
I
have
rob
you
?
  
<EOS>
rob
me
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
why
so
you
have
,
hussy
;
you
have
rob
me
.
 
<EOS>
who
?
 
I
,
sir
?
<EOS>
say
I
;
have
I
rob
you
?
 
<EOS>
why
then
you
be
a
justice
of
peace
,
and
may
send
me
to
gaol
,
if
you
please
,
and
bring
me
to
a
trial
for
my
life
!
<EOS>
if
you
can
prove
that
I
have
rob
you
,
I
be
sure
I
ought
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
be
quite
ignorant
of
his
meaning
;
though
I
do
not
like
it
,
when
it
be
afterwards
explain
,
neither
:
<EOS>
and
well
,
think
I
,
what
will
this
come
to
at
last
,
if
poor
Pamela
be
esteem
a
thief
!
 
<EOS>
then
I
think
in
an
instant
,
how
I
should
shew
my
face
to
my
honest
poor
parent
,
if
I
be
but
suspect
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
say
I
,
let
me
ask
you
but
one
question
,
and
pray
do
not
let
me
be
call
name
for
it
;
for
I
do
not
mean
disrespectfully
:
why
,
if
I
have
do
amiss
,
be
I
not
leave
to
be
discharge
by
your
housekeeper
,
as
the
other
maid
have
be
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
Jane
,
or
Rachel
,
or
Hannah
,
be
to
offend
,
would
your
honour
stoop
to
take
notice
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
you
so
demean
yourself
to
take
notice
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
if
I
have
not
be
bad
than
other
,
why
should
I
suffer
more
than
other
?
<EOS>
and
why
should
I
not
be
turn
away
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
for
indeed
I
be
not
of
consequence
enough
for
my
master
to
concern
himself
,
and
be
angry
about
such
a
creature
as
me
.
  
<EOS>
do
you
hear
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
cry
he
again
,
how
pertly
I
be
interrogate
by
this
saucy
slut
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
sauce
-
box
,
say
he
,
do
not
my
good
mother
desire
me
to
take
care
of
you
?
 
<EOS>
and
have
you
not
be
always
distinguish
by
me
,
above
a
common
servant
?
 
<EOS>
and
do
your
ingratitude
upbraid
me
for
this
?
  
<EOS>
I
say
something
mutteringly
,
and
he
vow
he
would
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
excuse
;
but
he
insist
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
say
I
,
if
your
honour
must
know
,
I
say
,
that
my
good
lady
do
not
desire
your
care
to
extend
to
the
summer
-
house
,
and
her
dressing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
this
be
a
little
saucy
,
you
will
say
 
<EOS>
and
he
fly
into
such
a
passion
,
that
I
be
force
to
run
for
it
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
say
,
It
be
happy
I
get
out
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
why
what
make
him
provoke
one
<EOS>
so
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
almost
sorry
for
it
;
but
I
would
be
glad
to
get
away
at
any
rate
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
begin
to
be
more
fearful
now
.
  
<EOS>
just
now
Mr.
Jonathan
send
me
these
line
(
bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
)
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mrs.
Pamela

<EOS>
I

by
Mrs.

<EOS>

though
she
do
not

any
harm

<EOS>
but
I
have
be

and

in
a
strange
fluster
;
and
I
suppose
too
,
she
will
say
,
I

be
full
pert

<EOS>
o

my

and
he

be
very
good
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
so
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
shall
send
this
in
the
morning
;
but
may
be
not
;
so
will
not
conclude
:
though
I
can
not
say
too
often
,
that
I
be
(
though
with
great
apprehension
)
                     
<EOS>
Your
most
dutiful
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
parent
,
  
<EOS>
o
let
me
take
up
my
complaint
,
and
say
,
never
be
poor
creature
so
unhappy
,
and
so
barbarously
use
,
as
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
my
heart
's
just
broke
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
neither
write
as
I
should
do
,
nor
let
it
alone
,
for
to
whom
<EOS>
but
you
can
I
vent
my
griefs
,
and
keep
my
poor
heart
from
burst
!
 
<EOS>
wicked
,
wicked
man
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
when
I
think
of
him

<EOS>
but
yet
,
do
not
be
frighten
 
for
 
<EOS>
I
hope
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
I
be
honest

<EOS>
but
if
my
head
and
my
hand
will
let
me
,
you
shall
hear
all
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
no
constable
,
nor
headborough
,
though
,
to
take
me
out
of
his
house

<EOS>
for
I
be
sure
I
can
safely
swear
the
peace
against
him
:
<EOS>
but
,
alas

<EOS>
he

he

such
a

God

John

and
have
see
nobody
but
Mrs.
Jervis
or
Rachel
,
and
one
I
hate
to
see
or
be
see
by
and
indeed
I
hate
now
to
see
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
strange
thing
I
have
to
tell
you
,
that
happen
since
last
night
,
that
good
Mr.
Jonathan

and
my

into
such
a
fluster

but
I

you
in
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
I

my
wicked
master
have
hide
himself
,
base
gentleman
as
he
be
!
<EOS>
in
her
closet
,
where
she
have
a
few
book
,
and
chest
of
drawer
,
and
such
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
little
suspect
it
;
though
I
use
,
till
this
sad
night
,
always
to
look
into
that
closet
and
another
in
the
room
,
and
under
the
bed
,
ever
since
the
summer
-
house
trick
;
but
never
find
any
thing
;
and
so
I
do
not
do
it
then
,
be
fully
resolve
to
be
angry
with
Mrs.
Jervis
for
what
have
happen
in
the
day
,
and
so
thought
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
myself
down
on
one
side
of
the
bed
,
and
she
on
the
other
,
and
we
begin
to
undress
ourselves
;
but
she
on
that
side
next
the
wicked
closet
,
that
hold
the
bad
heart
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
,
you
will
not
speak
to
me
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
I
find
you
be
angry
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
so
I
be
,
a
little
;
'
tis
a
folly
to
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
what
I
have
suffer
by
your
force
me
in
to
my
master
:
and
a
gentlewoman
of
your
year
and
experience
must
needs
know
,
that
it
be
not
fit
for
me
to
pretend
to
be
any
body
else
for
my
own
sake
,
nor
with
regard
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
say
she
,
who
would
have
think
it
would
have
turn
out
so
?
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
I
,
little
thinking
who
hear
me
,
Lucifer
always
be
ready
to
promote
his
own
work
and
workman
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
presently
what
use
he
make
of
it
,
pretend
not
to
know
me
,
on
purpose
to
be
free
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
take
upon
himself
to
know
me
,
to
quarrel
with
me
,
and
use
me
hardly
:
<EOS>
and
you
too
,
say
I
,
to
cry
,
Fie
,
fie
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
cut
me
to
the
heart
:
for
that
encourage
him
.
  
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
my
dear
,
say
she
,
that
I
would
encourage
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
say
so
to
you
before
;
but
,
since
you
have
force
it
from
me
,
I
must
tell
you
,
that
,
ever
since
you
consult
me
,
I
have
use
my
utmost
endeavour
to
divert
him
from
his
wicked
purpose
:
and
he
have
promise
fair
;
but
,
to
say
all
in
a
word
<EOS>
,
he
doat
upon
you
;
and
I
begin
to
see
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
luckily
say
nothing
of
the
note
from
Mr.
Jonathan
;
for
I
begin
to
suspect
all
the
world
almost
:
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
to
try
Mrs.
Jervis
,
<EOS>
well
then
,
what
would
you
have
me
do
?
 
<EOS>
You
see
he
be
for
have
me
wait
on
Lady
Davers
now
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
I
will
tell
you
freely
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
she
,
and
I
trust
to
your
discretion
to
conceal
what
I
say
:
my
master
have
be
often
desire
me
to
put
you
upon
ask
him
to
let
you
stay
     
<EOS>
yes
,
say
I
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
let
me
interrupt
you
:
I
will
tell
you
why
I
could
not
think
of
that
:
It
be
not
the
pride
of
my
heart
,
but
the
pride
of
my
honesty
:
for
what
must
have
be
the
case
?
 
<EOS>
here
my
master
have
be
very
rude
to
me
,
once
and
twice
;
and
you
say
he
can
not
help
it
,
though
he
pretend
to
be
sorry
for
it
:
<EOS>
well
,
he
have
give
me
warn
to
leave
my
place
,
and
use
me
very
harshly
;
perhaps
to
frighten
me
to
his
purpose
,
as
he
suppose
I
would
be
fond
of
stay
(
as
indeed
I
should
,
if
I
could
be
safe
;
for
I
love
you
and
all
the
house
,
and
value
him
,
if
he
would
act
as
my
master
)
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
as
I
know
his
design
,
and
that
he
own
he
can
not
help
it
;
must
I
have
ask
to
stay
,
know
he
would
attempt
me
again
?
<EOS>
for
all
you
could
assure
me
of
,
be
,
he
would
do
nothing
by
force
;
so
I
,
a
poor
weak
girl
,
be
to
be
leave
to
my
own
strength
!
 
<EOS>
and
be
not
this
to
allow
him
to
tempt
me
,
as
one
may
say
?
<EOS>
and
to
encourage
him
to
go
on
in
his
wicked
device
?
 
<EOS>
how
then
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
could
I
ask
or
wish
to
stay
?
  
<EOS>
You
say
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
child
,
say
she
;
and
you
have
a
justness
of
thought
above
your
year
;
and
for
all
these
consideration
,
and
for
what
I
have
hear
this
day
,
after
you
run
away
,
(
and
I
be
glad
you
go
as
you
do
,
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
persuade
you
to
stay
;
and
I
shall
be
glad
,
(
which
be
what
I
never
think
I
could
have
say
,
)
that
you
be
well
at
your
father
's
;
for
if
Lady
Davers
will
entertain
you
<EOS>
,
she
may
as
well
have
you
from
thence
as
here
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
say
I
;
God
will
bless
you
for
your
good
counsel
to
a
poor
maiden
,
that
be
hard
beset
.
 
<EOS>
but
pray
what
do
he
say
,
when
I
be
go
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
he
be
very
angry
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
would
hear
it
!
<EOS>
say
I
:
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
a
little
bold
;
but
then
he
provoke
me
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
have
not
my
honesty
be
in
the
case
<EOS>
,
I
would
not
by
any
mean
have
be
so
saucy
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
consider
it
be
the
truth
;
if
he
do
not
love
to
hear
of
the
summer
-
house
,
and
the
dressing
-
room
,
why
should
he
not
be
ashamed
to
continue
in
the
same
mind
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
she
,
when
you
have
mutter
this
to
yourself
,
you
may
have
tell
him
any
thing
else
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
tell
a
wilful
lie
,
and
<EOS>
so
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
find
you
now
give
him
up
,
and
think
there
be
danger
in
stay
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
well
out
of
the
house
;
so
it
be
at
the
bottom
of
a
wet
ditch
,
on
the
wildest
common
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
it
signify
nothing
to
tell
you
all
he
say
<EOS>
but
it
be
enough
to
make
me
fear
you
would
not
be
so
safe
as
I
could
wish
;
and
,
upon
my
word
,
Pamela
,
I
do
not
wonder
he
love
you
;
<EOS>
for
,
without
flattery
,
you
be
a
charming
girl
!
<EOS>
and
I
never
see
you
look
more
lovely
in
your
life
than
in
that
same
new
dress
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
such
a
surprise
upon
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
truly
,
you
owe
some
of
your
danger
to
the
lovely
appearance
you
make
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
say
I
,
I
wish
the
clothe
in
the
fire
:
<EOS>
I
expect
no
effect
from
them
;
but
,
if
any
,
a
quite
contrary
one
.
  
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
do
you
not
hear
something
stir
in
the
closet
?
<EOS>
no
,
silly
girl
,
say
she
,
your
fear
be
always
awake
.
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
,
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
hear
something
rustle
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
,
say
she
,
the
cat
may
be
get
there
:
<EOS>
but
I
hear
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
hush
;
but
she
say
,
Pr'ythee
,
my
good
girl
,
make
haste
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
see
if
the
door
be
fast
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
do
,
and
be
think
to
look
into
the
closet
;
<EOS>
but
,
hear
no
more
noise
,
think
it
needless
,
and
so
go
again
and
sit
myself
down
on
the
bed
-
side
,
and
go
on
undress
myself
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Jervis
be
by
this
time
undress
,
step
into
bed
,
and
bid
me
hasten
,
for
she
be
sleepy
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
be
the
matter
,
but
my
heart
sadly
misgave
me
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr.
Jonathan
's
note
be
enough
to
make
it
do
so
,
with
what
Mrs.
Jervis
have
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
pull
off
my
stay
,
and
my
stocking
,
and
all
my
clothe
to
an
under
-
petticoat
;
and
then
hear
a
rustling
again
in
the
closet
,
I
say
,
Heaven
protect
us
!
<EOS>
but
before
I
say
my
prayer
,
I
must
look
into
this
closet
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
be
go
to
it
<EOS>
slip
-
shod
,
when
,
o
dreadful
!
<EOS>
out
rush
my
master
in
a
rich
silk
and
silver
morning
gown
.
  
<EOS>
I
scream
,
and
run
to
the
bed
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
scream
too
;
and
he
say
,
I
will
do
you
no
harm
,
if
you
forbear
this
noise
;
but
otherwise
take
what
follow
.
  
<EOS>
instantly
he
come
to
the
bed
<EOS>
(
for
I
have
creep
into
it
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
with
my
coat
on
,
and
my
shoe
)
;
and
take
me
in
his
arm
,
say
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
rise
,
and
just
step
up
stair
to
keep
the
maid
from
come
down
at
this
noise
:
<EOS>
I
will
do
no
harm
to
this
rebel
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
for
pity
's
sake
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
if
I
be
not
betray
,
do
not
leave
me
;
and
,
I
beseech
you
,
raise
all
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
will
not
stir
,
my
dear
lamb
;
I
will
not
leave
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
you
,
sir
,
say
she
;
and
kindly
throw
herself
upon
my
coat
,
clasp
me
round
the
waist
:
<EOS>
You
shall
not
hurt
this
innocent
,
say
she
:
for
I
will
lose
my
life
in
her
defence
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
not
,
say
she
,
enough
wicked
one
in
the
world
,
for
your
base
purpose
,
but
you
must
attempt
such
a
lamb
as
this
?
  
<EOS>
He
be
desperate
angry
,
and
threaten
to
throw
her
out
of
the
window
;
and
to
turn
her
out
of
the
house
the
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
,
sir
,
say
she
;
for
I
will
not
stay
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
defend
my
poor
Pamela
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
we
will
both
go
together
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
,
let
me
but
expostulate
a
word
or
two
with
you
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Pamela
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
,
do
not
hear
a
word
,
except
he
leave
the
bed
,
and
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
ay
,
out
of
the
room
,
say
I
;
expostulate
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
must
expostulate
!
  
<EOS>
I
find
his
hand
in
my
bosom
;
and
when
my
fright
let
me
know
it
,
I
be
ready
to
die
;
and
I
sigh
and
scream
,
and
faint
away
.
 
<EOS>
and
still
he
have
his
arm
about
my
neck
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
be
about
my
foot
,
and
upon
my
coat
.
 
<EOS>
and
all
in
a
cold
dewy
sweat
be
i.
 
Pamela
!
<EOS>
Pamela
!
<EOS>
say
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
she
tell
me
since
,
O####h
,
and
give
another
shriek
,
my
poor
Pamela
be
dead
for
certain
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
to
be
sure
,
I
be
for
a
time
;
for
I
know
nothing
more
of
the
matter
,
one
fit
follow
another
,
till
about
three
hour
after
,
as
it
prove
to
be
,
I
find
myself
in
bed
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
sit
upon
one
side
,
with
her
wrapper
about
her
,
and
Rachel
on
the
other
;
and
no
master
,
for
the
wicked
wretch
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
overjoyed
,
that
I
hardly
could
believe
myself
;
and
I
say
,
which
be
my
first
word
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Mrs.
Rachel
,
can
I
be
sure
it
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
!
<EOS>
can
I
?
 
<EOS>
where
have
I
be
?
 
<EOS>
Hush
,
my
dear
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
;
you
have
be
in
fit
after
fit
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
any
body
so
frightful
in
my
life
!
  
<EOS>
by
this
I
judge
Rachel
know
nothing
of
the
matter
;
and
it
seem
my
wicked
master
have
,
upon
Mrs.
Jervis
's
second
noise
on
my
fainting
away
,
slipt
out
,
and
,
as
if
he
have
come
from
his
own
chamber
,
disturb
by
the
screaming
,
go
up
to
the
maid
'
room
,
(
who
,
hear
the
noise
,
lie
tremble
,
and
afraid
to
stir
,
)
and
bid
them
go
down
,
and
see
what
be
the
matter
with
Mrs.
Jervis
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
charge
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
promise
to
forgive
her
for
what
she
have
say
and
do
,
if
she
would
conceal
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
maid
come
down
,
and
all
go
up
again
,
when
I
come
to
myself
a
little
,
except
Rachel
,
who
staid
to
sit
up
with
me
,
and
bear
Mrs.
Jervis
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
they
all
guess
the
matter
to
be
bad
enough
;
though
they
dare
not
say
any
thing
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
my
danger
,
and
the
freedom
he
actually
take
,
though
I
believe
Mrs.
Jervis
save
me
from
bad
,
and
she
say
she
do
,
(
though
what
can
I
think
,
who
be
in
a
fit
,
and
know
nothing
of
the
matter
?
)
<EOS>
I
be
almost
distract
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
I
be
afraid
of
Mrs.
Jervis
;
but
I
be
fully
satisfied
<EOS>
she
be
very
good
,
and
I
should
have
be
lose
but
for
her
;
and
she
take
on
grievously
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
would
have
become
of
me
,
have
she
go
out
of
the
room
,
to
still
the
maid
,
as
he
bid
her
!
 
<EOS>
He
would
certainly
have
shut
her
out
,
and
then
,
mercy
on
me
!
<EOS>
what
would
have
become
of
your
poor
Pamela
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
leave
off
a
little
;
for
my
eye
and
my
head
be
sadly
bad
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
dreadful
trial
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
bad
of
all
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
that
I
be
out
of
the
power
of
this
dreadfully
wicked
man
!
 
<EOS>
pray
for
                                             
Your
distressed
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
do
not
rise
till
ten
o'clock
,
and
I
have
all
the
concern
and
wish
of
the
family
,
and
multitude
of
inquiry
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
wicked
master
go
out
early
to
hunt
;
but
leave
word
he
would
be
in
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
up
to
our
chamber
about
eleven
,
and
have
nothing
to
do
to
be
sorry
;
for
he
be
our
master
,
and
so
put
on
sharp
anger
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
great
emotion
at
his
enter
the
room
,
and
throw
my
apron
over
my
head
,
and
fall
a
crying
,
as
if
my
heart
would
break
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
he
,
since
I
know
you
,
and
you
me
<EOS>
so
well
,
I
do
not
know
how
we
shall
live
together
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
she
,
I
will
take
the
liberty
to
say
,
what
I
think
be
good
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
so
much
grief
,
that
you
should
attempt
to
do
any
injury
to
this
poor
girl
,
and
especially
in
my
chamber
,
that
I
should
think
myself
accessary
to
the
mischief
,
if
I
be
not
to
take
notice
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
though
my
ruin
,
therefore
,
may
depend
upon
it
,
<EOS>
I
desire
not
to
stay
;
but
pray
let
poor
Pamela
and
me
go
together
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
my
heart
,
say
he
;
and
the
sooner
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
fall
a
crying
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
say
he
,
this
girl
have
make
a
party
of
the
whole
house
in
her
favour
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Her
innocence
deserve
it
of
us
all
,
say
she
very
kindly
:
and
I
never
could
have
think
that
the
son
of
my
dear
good
lady
depart
,
could
have
so
forfeit
his
honour
,
as
to
endeavour
to
destroy
a
virtue
he
ought
to
protect
.
 
<EOS>
no
more
of
this
,
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
I
will
not
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Pamela
,
she
have
a
lucky
knack
of
fall
into
fit
,
when
she
please
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
cursed
yelling
of
you
both
make
me
not
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
intend
no
harm
to
her
,
as
I
tell
you
both
,
if
you
would
have
leave
your
squalling
:
<EOS>
and
I
do
no
harm
neither
,
but
to
myself
;
for
I
raise
a
hornet
's
nest
about
my
ear
,
that
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
may
have
sting
to
death
my
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
Mrs.
Jervis
,
then
I
beg
Mr.
Longman
may
take
my
account
,
and
I
will
go
away
as
soon
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Pamela
,
she
be
at
her
liberty
,
I
hope
,
to
go
away
next
Thursday
,
as
she
intend
?
  
<EOS>
I
sit
still
;
for
I
could
not
speak
nor
look
up
,
and
his
presence
discompose
me
extremely
;
but
I
be
sorry
to
hear
myself
the
unhappy
occasion
of
Mrs.
Jervis
's
lose
her
place
,
and
hope
that
may
be
still
make
up
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
let
Mr.
Longman
make
up
your
account
,
as
soon
as
you
will
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
(
who
be
his
housekeeper
in
Lincolnshire
)
shall
come
hither
in
your
place
,
and
will
not
be
less
obliging
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
than
you
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
I
have
never
disoblige
you
till
now
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
sir
,
if
you
know
what
belong
to
your
own
reputation
or
honour
 
<EOS>
no
more
,
no
more
,
say
he
,
of
these
antiquated
topic
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
no
bad
friend
to
you
;
and
I
shall
always
esteem
you
,
though
you
have
not
be
so
faithful
to
my
secret
as
I
could
have
wish
,
and
have
lay
me
open
to
this
girl
,
which
have
make
her
more
afraid
of
me
than
she
have
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
she
,
after
what
pass
yesterday
,
and
last
night
,
I
think
I
go
rather
too
far
in
favour
of
your
injunction
than
otherwise
;
and
I
should
have
deserve
every
body
's
censure
,
as
the
basest
of
creature
,
have
I
be
capable
of
contribute
to
your
lawless
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
still
reflect
upon
me
,
and
all
for
imaginary
fault
!
<EOS>
for
what
harm
have
I
do
the
girl
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
bear
it
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
in
respect
to
my
mother
,
I
be
willing
to
part
friendly
with
you
though
you
ought
both
of
you
to
reflect
on
the
freedom
of
your
conversation
,
in
relation
to
me
;
which
I
should
have
resent
more
than
I
do
,
but
that
I
be
conscious
I
have
no
business
to
demean
myself
so
as
to
be
in
your
closet
,
where
I
may
have
expect
to
hear
a
multitude
of
impertinence
between
you
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
she
,
you
have
no
objection
,
I
hope
,
to
Pamela
's
go
away
on
Thursday
next
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
mighty
solicitous
,
say
he
,
about
Pamela
:
<EOS>
but
no
,
not
I
;
let
her
go
as
soon
as
she
will
:
<EOS>
She
be
a
naughty
girl
,
and
have
bring
all
this
upon
herself
;
and
upon
me
more
trouble
than
she
can
have
have
from
me
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
overcome
it
all
,
and
will
never
concern
myself
about
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
proposal
make
me
,
add
he
,
since
I
have
be
out
this
morning
,
that
I
shall
go
near
to
embrace
;
and
so
wish
only
,
that
a
discreet
use
may
be
make
of
what
be
past
;
and
there
be
an
end
of
every
thing
with
me
,
as
to
Pamela
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
clasp
my
hand
together
through
my
apron
,
overjoy
at
this
,
though
I
be
soon
to
go
away
:
for
,
naughty
as
he
have
be
to
me
,
I
wish
his
prosperity
with
all
my
heart
,
for
my
good
old
lady
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
you
need
not
now
be
afraid
to
speak
to
me
;
tell
me
what
you
lift
up
your
hand
at
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
not
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
if
you
like
what
I
have
say
,
give
me
your
hand
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
hold
my
hand
up
through
my
apron
;
for
I
could
not
speak
to
him
;
and
he
take
hold
of
it
,
and
press
it
,
though
less
hard
than
he
do
my
arm
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
the
little
fool
cover
her
face
for
?
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
pull
your
apron
away
;
and
let
me
see
how
you
look
,
after
your
freedom
of
speech
of
me
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
you
be
ashamed
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
be
very
free
with
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
stand
this
barbarous
insult
,
as
I
take
it
to
be
,
consider
his
behaviour
to
me
;
and
I
then
speak
and
say
,
o
<EOS>
the
difference
between
the
mind
of
thy
creature
,
good
God
!
 
<EOS>
how
shall
some
be
cast
down
in
their
innocence
,
while
other
can
triumph
in
their
guilt
!
  
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
I
go
up
stair
to
my
chamber
,
and
write
all
this
<EOS>
;
for
though
he
vex
me
at
his
taunting
,
yet
I
be
pleased
to
hear
he
be
likely
to
be
married
,
and
that
his
wicked
intention
be
so
happily
overcome
as
to
me
;
and
this
make
me
a
little
easy
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
I
have
pass
the
bad
;
or
else
it
be
very
hard
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
shall
not
think
myself
at
ease
quite
,
till
I
be
with
you
:
<EOS>
for
,
methink
,
after
all
,
his
repentance
and
amendment
be
mighty
suddenly
resolve
upon
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
divine
grace
be
not
confine
to
space
;
and
remorse
may
,
and
I
hope
have
,
smitten
him
to
the
heart
at
once
,
for
his
injury
to
poor
me
!
 
<EOS>
yet
I
will
not
be
too
secure
neither
.
  
<EOS>
have
opportunity
,
I
send
now
what
I
know
will
grieve
you
to
the
heart
.
<EOS>
but
I
hope
I
shall
bring
my
next
scribble
myself
;
and
so
conclude
,
though
half
break
-
hearted
,
                     
Your
ever
dutiful
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
I
desire
you
not
to
meet
me
,
and
John
say
you
will
not
;
for
he
tell
you
he
be
sure
I
shall
get
a
passage
well
enough
,
either
behind
some
one
of
my
fellow
-
servant
on
horseback
,
or
by
farmer
Nichols
's
mean
:
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
chariot
he
talk
to
you
of
,
I
can
not
expect
that
favour
,
to
be
sure
;
and
I
should
not
care
for
it
,
because
it
would
look
so
much
above
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
farmer
Brady
,
they
say
,
have
a
chaise
with
one
horse
,
and
we
hope
to
borrow
that
,
or
hire
it
,
rather
than
fail
;
though
money
run
a
little
lowish
,
after
what
I
have
lay
out
;
but
I
do
not
care
to
say
so
here
;
though
I
warrant
I
may
have
what
I
would
of
Mrs.
Jervis
,
or
Mr.
Jonathan
,
or
Mr.
Longman
;
but
then
how
shall
I
pay
it
?
<EOS>
you
will
say
:
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
I
do
not
love
to
be
behold
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
chief
reason
I
be
glad
you
do
not
set
out
to
meet
me
,
be
the
uncertainty
;
for
it
seem
I
must
stay
another
week
still
,
and
hope
certainly
to
go
Thursday
after
.
 
<EOS>
for
poor
Mrs.
Jervis
will
go
at
the
same
time
,
she
say
,
and
can
not
be
ready
before
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
be
once
well
with
you
!
 
<EOS>
though
he
be
very
civil
too
at
present
,
and
not
so
cross
as
he
be
:
and
yet
he
be
as
vexatious
another
way
,
as
you
shall
hear
.
 
<EOS>
for
yesterday
he
have
a
rich
suit
of
clothe
bring
home
,
<EOS>
which
they
call
a
birth
-
day
suit
;
for
he
intend
to
go
to
London
against
next
birth
-
day
,
to
see
the
court
;
and
our
folk
will
have
it
<EOS>
he
be
to
be
make
a
lord
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
they
may
make
him
an
honest
man
,
as
he
be
always
think
;
but
I
have
not
find
it
so
,
alas
for
me
!
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
as
I
be
say
,
he
have
these
clothe
come
home
,
and
he
try
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
and
before
he
pull
them
off
,
he
send
for
me
,
when
nobody
else
be
in
the
parlour
with
him
:
<EOS>
Pamela
,
say
he
,
you
be
so
neat
and
so
nice
in
your
own
dress
,
(
<EOS>
Alack
-
a
-
day
,
I
do
not
know
I
be
!
)
<EOS>
that
you
must
be
a
judge
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
these
clothe
make
?
 
<EOS>
do
they
fit
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
judge
,
say
I
,
and
please
your
honour
;
but
I
think
they
look
very
fine
.
  
<EOS>
His
waistcoat
stand
on
end
with
silver
lace
,
and
he
look
very
grand
.
<EOS>
but
what
he
do
last
,
have
make
me
very
serious
,
and
I
could
make
him
no
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
why
do
not
you
wear
your
usual
clothe
?
 
<EOS>
though
I
think
every
thing
look
well
upon
you
(
for
I
still
continue
in
my
new
dress
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
have
no
clothe
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
ought
to
call
my
own
,
but
these
:
<EOS>
and
it
be
no
matter
<EOS>
what
such
an
one
as
I
wear
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
,
why
you
look
very
serious
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
can
bear
malice
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
so
I
can
,
sir
,
say
I
,
accord
to
the
occasion
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
your
eye
always
look
red
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
not
a
fool
to
take
my
last
freedom
so
much
to
heart
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
,
and
that
fool
Mrs.
Jervis
,
frighten
me
,
by
your
hideous
squalling
,
as
much
as
I
could
frighten
you
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
we
have
for
it
,
say
I
;
and
if
you
could
be
so
afraid
of
your
own
servant
know
of
your
attempt
upon
a
poor
unworthy
creature
,
that
be
under
your
protection
while
I
stay
,
surely
your
honour
ought
to
be
more
afraid
of
God
Almighty
,
in
whose
presence
we
all
stand
,
in
every
action
of
our
life
,
and
to
whom
the
great
,
as
well
as
the
least
,
must
be
accountable
,
let
them
think
what
they
list
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
my
hand
,
in
a
kind
of
good
-
humoured
mockery
,
and
say
,
well
urge
,
my
pretty
preacher
!
 
<EOS>
when
my
Lincolnshire
chaplain
die
,
I
will
put
thee
on
a
gown
and
cassock
,
and
thou'lt
make
a
good
figure
in
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
 
wish
,
say
I
,
a
little
vexed
at
his
jeer
,
your
honour
's
conscience
would
be
your
preacher
,
and
then
you
would
need
no
other
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
no
more
of
this
unfashionable
jargon

<EOS>
I
do
not
send
for
you
so
much
for
your
opinion
of
my
new
suit
,
as
to
tell
you
,
you
be
welcome
to
stay
,
since
Mrs.
Jervis
desire
it
,
till
she
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
welcome
!
<EOS>
say
I
;
I
be
sure
I
shall
rejoice
when
I
be
out
of
the
house
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
you
be
an
ungrateful
baggage
;
but
I
be
think
it
would
be
pity
,
with
these
fair
soft
hand
,
and
that
lovely
skin
,
(
as
he
call
it
,
and
take
hold
of
my
hand
,
)
that
you
should
return
again
to
hard
work
,
as
you
must
if
you
go
to
your
father
's
;
and
so
I
would
advise
her
to
take
a
house
in
London
,
and
let
lodging
to
us
member
of
parliament
,
when
we
come
to
town
;
and
such
a
pretty
daughter
as
you
may
pass
for
,
will
always
fill
her
house
,
and
she
will
get
a
great
deal
of
money
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sadly
vexed
at
this
barbarous
joke
;
but
be
ready
to
cry
before
,
the
tear
gush
out
,
and
(
endeavour
to
get
my
hand
from
him
,
but
in
vain
)
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
can
expect
no
better
:
<EOS>
Your
behaviour
,
sir
,
to
me
,
have
be
just
of
a
piece
with
these
word
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
will
say
it
,
though
you
be
to
be
ever
so
angry
.
 
<EOS>
I
angry
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
say
he
,
I
have
overcome
all
that
;
and
as
you
be
to
go
away
,
I
look
upon
you
now
as
Mrs.
Jervis
's
guest
while
you
both
stay
,
and
not
as
my
servant
;
and
so
you
may
say
what
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
why
you
need
not
take
this
matter
in
such
high
disdain
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
very
pretty
romantic
turn
for
virtue
,
and
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
suppose
<EOS>
but
you
will
hold
it
still
:
and
nobody
will
be
able
to
prevail
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
my
child
,
(
sneeringly
he
speak
it
,
)
do
but
consider
what
a
fine
opportunity
you
will
then
have
for
a
tale
every
day
to
good
mother
Jervis
,
and
what
subject
for
letter
-
writing
to
your
father
and
mother
,
and
what
pretty
preachment
you
may
hold
forth
to
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Ad
's
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
the
good
thing
<EOS>
you
and
she
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
You
do
well
<EOS>
,
sir
,
say
I
,
to
even
your
wit
to
such
a
poor
maiden
as
me
:
<EOS>
but
,
permit
me
to
say
,
that
if
you
be
not
rich
and
great
,
and
I
poor
and
little
,
you
would
not
insult
me
thus
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
ask
you
,
sir
,
if
you
think
this
become
your
fine
clothe
,
and
a
master
's
station
:
<EOS>
why
so
serious
,
my
pretty
Pamela
?
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
why
so
grave
?
 
<EOS>
and
would
kiss
me
;
but
my
heart
be
full
,
and
I
say
,
let
me
alone
;
I
will
tell
you
,
if
you
be
a
king
,
and
insult
me
as
you
have
do
,
that
you
have
forget
to
act
like
a
gentleman
;
and
I
will
not
stay
to
be
use
thus
:
I
will
go
to
the
next
farmer
's
,
and
there
wait
for
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
she
must
go
:
<EOS>
and
I
would
have
you
know
,
sir
,
that
I
can
stoop
to
the
ordinari
work
of
your
scullion
,
for
all
these
nasty
soft
hand
,
sooner
than
bear
such
ungentlemanly
imputation
.
  
<EOS>
I
send
for
you
,
say
he
,
in
high
good
humour
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
hold
it
with
such
an
impertinent
:
however
,
I
will
keep
my
temper
.
 
<EOS>
but
while
I
see
you
here
,
pray
do
not
put
on
those
dismal
grave
<EOS>
look
:
why
,
girl
,
you
should
forbear
them
,
if
it
be
but
for
your
pride
-
sake
;
for
the
family
will
think
you
be
grieve
to
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
will
try
to
convince
them
of
the
contrary
,
as
well
as
your
honour
;
for
I
will
endeavour
to
be
more
cheerful
while
I
stay
,
for
that
very
reason
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
reply
he
,
I
will
set
this
down
by
itself
,
as
the
first
time
that
ever
what
I
have
advise
have
any
weight
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
add
,
say
I
,
as
the
first
advice
you
have
give
me
of
late
,
that
be
fit
to
be
follow
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
say
he
,
(
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
write
it
,
impudent
gentleman
as
he
be
!
)
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
thee
as
quick
another
way
,
as
thou
art
in
thy
repartee
 
<EOS>
and
he
laugh
,
and
I
snatch
my
hand
from
him
,
and
I
trip
away
as
fast
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
think
I
,
married
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
be
time
you
be
married
,
or
,
at
this
rate
,
no
honest
maiden
ought
to
live
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
to
be
sure
he
grow
quite
a
rake
!
 
<EOS>
how
easy
it
be
to
go
from
bad
to
bad
,
when
once
people
give
way
to
vice
!
  
<EOS>
how
would
my
poor
lady
,
have
she
live
,
have
grieve
to
see
it
!
<EOS>
but
may
be
he
would
have
be
well
then
!
 
<EOS>
though
it
seem
he
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
,
he
have
an
eye
upon
me
in
his
mother
's
life
-
time
;
and
he
intend
to
let
me
know
as
much
,
by
the
bye
,
he
tell
her
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
shamelessness
for
you
!
<EOS>
sure
the
world
must
be
near
at
an
end
!
<EOS>
for
all
the
gentleman
about
be
as
bad
as
he
almost
,
as
far
as
I
can
hear
!
 
<EOS>
and
see
the
fruit
of
such
bad
example
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
"
Squire
Martin
in
the
grove
,
have
have
three
lying
-
<EOS>
in
,
it
seem
,
in
his
house
,
in
three
month
past
;
one
by
himself
;
and
one
by
his
coachman
;
and
one
by
his
woodman
;
and
yet
he
have
turn
none
of
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
<EOS>
,
how
can
he
,
when
they
but
follow
his
own
vile
example
?
<EOS>
there
be
he
,
and
two
or
three
more
such
as
he
,
within
ten
mile
of
us
,
who
keep
company
,
and
hunt
with
our
fine
master
,
truly
;
and
I
suppose
he
be
never
the
well
for
their
example
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Heaven
bless
me
,
say
I
,
and
send
me
out
of
this
wicked
house
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
what
sort
of
creature
must
the
womenkind
be
,
do
you
think
,
to
give
way
to
such
wickedness
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
this
it
be
that
make
every
one
be
think
of
alike
:
<EOS>
and
,
alack
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
what
a
world
we
live
in
!
<EOS>
for
it
be
grow
more
a
wonder
that
the
man
be
resist
,
than
that
the
woman
comply
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
I
suppose
,
make
me
such
a
sauce
-
box
,
and
bold
-
face
,
and
a
creature
,
and
all
because
I
will
not
be
a
sauce
-
box
and
bold
-
face
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
sorry
for
these
thing
;
one
do
not
know
what
art
and
stratagem
man
may
devise
to
gain
their
vile
end
;
and
so
I
will
think
as
well
as
I
can
of
these
poor
undone
creature
,
and
pity
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
you
see
,
by
my
sad
story
,
and
<EOS>
narrow
escape
,
what
hardship
poor
maiden
go
through
,
whose
lot
it
be
to
go
out
to
service
,
especially
to
house
where
there
be
not
the
fear
of
God
,
and
good
rule
keep
by
the
head
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
I
be
quite
grow
grave
and
serious
;
indeed
it
become
the
present
condition
of
                          
Your
dutiful
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
<EOS>
,
  
John
say
you
weep
when
you
read
my
last
letter
,
that
he
carry
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
you
let
him
see
that
;
for
they
all
mistrust
already
how
matter
be
,
and
as
it
be
no
credit
that
I
have
be
attempt
,
though
it
be
that
I
have
resist
;
yet
I
be
sorry
they
have
cause
to
think
so
evil
of
my
master
from
any
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
have
make
up
her
account
with
Mr.
Longman
,
and
will
stay
in
her
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
,
for
her
own
sake
,
and
for
my
master
's
;
for
she
have
a
good
master
of
him
;
so
indeed
all
have
,
but
poor
me
 
<EOS>
and
he
have
a
good
housekeeper
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
,
it
seem
,
take
upon
him
to
talk
to
my
master
,
how
faithful
and
careful
of
his
interest
she
be
,
and
how
exact
in
her
account
;
and
he
tell
him
,
there
be
no
comparison
between
her
account
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
,
at
the
Lincolnshire
estate
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
so
many
fine
thing
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
of
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
my
master
send
for
her
in
Mr.
Longman
's
presence
,
and
say
Pamela
may
come
along
with
her
;
I
suppose
to
mortify
me
,
that
I
must
go
while
she
be
to
stay
:
<EOS>
but
as
,
when
I
go
away
,
I
be
not
to
go
with
her
,
nor
be
she
to
go
with
me
;
so
I
do
not
matter
it
much
;
only
it
would
have
be
creditable
to
such
a
poor
girl
,
that
the
housekeeper
would
bear
me
company
,
if
I
go
.
  
<EOS>
say
he
to
her
,
<EOS>
well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Longman
say
you
have
make
up
your
account
with
him
with
your
usual
fidelity
and
exactness
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
make
you
an
offer
of
continue
with
me
,
if
you
can
be
a
little
sorry
for
your
hasty
word
,
which
,
indeed
,
be
not
so
respectful
as
I
have
deserve
at
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
at
a
sad
loss
what
to
say
,
because
Mr.
Longman
be
there
,
and
she
could
not
speak
of
the
occasion
of
those
word
,
which
be
me
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
say
Mr.
Longman
,
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
before
your
face
,
that
since
I
have
know
my
master
's
family
,
I
have
never
find
such
good
management
in
it
,
nor
so
much
love
and
harmony
neither
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
Lincolnshire
estate
be
as
well
serve
!
 
<EOS>
no
more
of
that
,
say
my
master
;
but
Mrs.
Jervis
may
stay
,
if
she
will
:
and
here
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
pray
accept
of
this
,
which
at
the
close
of
every
year
's
account
I
will
present
you
with
,
besides
your
salary
,
as
long
as
I
find
your
care
so
useful
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
give
her
five
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
him
a
low
courtesy
,
and
thank
him
,
look
to
me
,
as
if
she
would
have
speak
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
meaning
,
I
believe
;
for
he
say
,
 
indeed
I
love
to
encourage
merit
and
obligingness
,
Longman
;
but
I
can
never
be
equally
kind
to
those
who
do
not
deserve
it
at
my
hand
,
as
to
those
who
do
;
and
then
he
look
full
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
Longman
,
continue
he
,
I
say
that
girl
may
come
in
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
because
they
love
to
be
always
together
.
 
<EOS>
for
Mrs.
Jervis
be
very
good
to
her
,
and
love
her
as
well
as
if
she
be
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
but
else
 
Mr.
Longman
,
interrupt
him
,
say
,
good
to
Mrs.
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
ay
,
sir
,
and
so
she
be
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
but
every
body
must
be
good
to
her
;
for
     
He
be
go
on
:
but
my
master
say
,
no
more
,
no
more
,
Mr.
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
old
man
be
take
with
pretty
young
girl
,
as
well
as
other
folk
;
and
fair
look
hide
many
a
fault
,
where
a
person
have
the
art
to
behave
obligingly
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
and
please
your
honour
,
say
Mr.
Longman
,
every
body
 
and
be
go
on
,
I
believe
,
to
say
something
more
in
my
praise
,
but
he
interrupt
him
,
and
say
,
not
a
word
more
of
this
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
let
her
stay
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
;
not
only
for
her
own
freedom
of
speech
,
but
her
letter
-
writing
of
all
the
secret
of
my
family
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
the
good
old
man
,
I
be
sorry
for
that
too
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
 
no
more
,
I
say
,
say
my
master
;
for
my
reputation
be
so
well
known
,
(
mighty
fine
,
think
I
!
)
<EOS>
that
I
care
not
what
any
body
write
or
say
of
me
:
<EOS>
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
(
not
that
it
need
go
further
,
)
<EOS>
I
think
of
change
my
condition
soon
;
and
,
you
know
,
young
lady
of
birth
and
fortune
will
choose
their
own
servant
,
and
that
be
my
chief
reason
why
Pamela
can
not
stay
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
rest
,
say
he
,
the
girl
be
a
good
sort
of
body
,
take
her
altogether
;
though
I
must
needs
say
,
a
little
pert
,
since
my
mother
's
death
,
in
her
answer
,
and
give
me
two
word
for
one
;
which
I
can
not
bear
;
nor
be
there
reason
<EOS>
I
should
,
you
know
,
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
but
'
tis
strange
,
methink
,
she
should
be
so
mild
and
meek
to
every
one
of
us
in
the
house
,
and
forget
herself
so
,
where
she
should
shew
most
respect
!
<EOS>
very
true
,
Mr.
Longman
,
say
he
,
but
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
I
will
assure
you
;
and
it
be
from
her
pertness
,
that
Mrs.
Jervis
and
I
have
the
word
:
<EOS>
and
I
should
mind
it
the
less
,
but
that
the
girl
(
there
she
stand
,
I
say
it
to
her
face
)
have
wit
and
sense
above
her
year
,
and
know
better
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
great
pain
to
say
something
,
but
yet
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
,
before
Mr.
Longman
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
look
at
me
,
and
walk
to
the
window
to
hide
her
concern
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
say
,
It
be
for
you
,
sir
,
to
say
what
you
please
;
and
for
me
only
to
say
,
God
bless
your
honour
!
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Longman
falter
in
his
speech
,
and
be
ready
to
cry
.
 
<EOS>
say
my
insult
master
to
me
,
why
,
pr'ythee
,
Pamela
,
now
,
shew
thyself
as
thou
art
,
before
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
Can'st
not
give
him
a
speciman
of
that
pertness
which
thou
hast
exercise
upon
me
sometimes
?
  
<EOS>
do
he
not
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
deserve
all
the
truth
to
be
tell
?
<EOS>
yet
I
overcome
myself
so
far
,
as
to
say
<EOS>
,
well
,
your
honour
may
play
upon
a
poor
girl
,
that
you
know
call
answer
you
,
but
dare
not
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
pr'ythee
now
,
insinuator
,
say
he
,
say
the
bad
you
can
before
Longman
and
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
I
challenge
the
utmost
of
thy
impertinence
:
and
as
you
be
go
away
,
and
have
the
love
of
every
body
,
I
would
be
a
little
justified
to
my
family
,
that
you
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
hardship
from
me
,
as
I
have
pert
saucy
answer
from
you
,
besides
expose
me
by
your
letter
.
  
<EOS>
surely
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
be
of
no
consequence
equal
to
this
,
in
your
honour
's
family
,
that
such
a
great
gentleman
as
you
,
should
need
to
justify
yourself
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
Mrs.
Jervis
stay
with
your
honour
;
<EOS>
and
I
know
I
have
not
deserve
to
stay
:
and
,
more
than
that
,
I
do
not
desire
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
ad

<EOS>

Mr.
Longman
,
say
I
,
I
can
not

;
nor
will
I
stay
,
if
I
may

<EOS>
all
I
desire
be
,
to
return
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
:
<EOS>
and
though
I
love
you

I
will
not

<EOS>
o

<EOS>
say
the
good

I
do
not

this
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
get
matter
thus
far
,
and
have
make
all
up
for
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
be
in
hope
to
have
get
a
double
holiday
of
joy
for
all
the
family
,
in
your
pardon
too
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
my
master
,
this
be
a
little
speciman
of
what
I
tell
you
,
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
there
be
a
spirit
you
do
not
expect
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
tell
me
after
,
that
she
could
stay
no
longer
,
to
hear
me
so
hardly
use
;
and
must
have
speak
,
have
she
staid
,
what
would
never
have
be
forgive
her
;
so
she
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
after
her
to
go
too
;
but
my
master
say
,
Come
,
Pamela
,
give
another
speciman
,
I
desire
you
,
to
Longman
I
be
sure
you
must

if
you
will
but
speak
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
I
,
since
it
seem
your
greatness
want
to
be
justify
by
my
lowness
,
and
I
have
no
desire
you
should
suffer
in
the
sight
of
your
family
,
I
will
say
,
on
my
bended
knee
,
(
<EOS>
and
so
I
kneel
down
,
)
<EOS>
that
I
have
be
a
very
faulty
,
and
a
very
ungrateful
creature
to
the
good
of
master
<EOS>
:
I
have
be
very
perverse
and
saucy
;
and
have
deserve
nothing
at
your
hand
but
to
be
turn
out
of
your
family
with
shame
and
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
therefore
,
have
nothing
to
say
for
myself
,
but
that
I
be
not
worthy
to
stay
,
and
so
can
not
wish
to
stay
,
and
will
not
stay
:
<EOS>
and
so
God
Almighty
bless
you
,
and
you
Mr.
Longman

and
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
every
live
soul
of
the
family

<EOS>
and
I
will
pray
for
you
as
long
as
I

<EOS>
and
so
I
rise
up
,
and
be
force
to
lean
upon
my
master
's
elbow
-
chair
,
or
I
should
have
sink
down
.
  
<EOS>

My

and
take
his
handkerchief

<EOS>
Nay

run
away
at

.
 
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
say
my
master
,
with
an
imperious
tone
,
get
out
of
my
presence
,
hussy
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
you
in
my
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
be
go
as
fast
as
I
can
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
my
head
be
so
giddy
,
and
my
limb
tremble
so
,
that
I
be
force
to
go
hold
by
the
wainscot
all
the
way
with
both
my
hand
,
and
think
I
should
not
have
get
to
the
door
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
do
,
as
I
hope
this
would
be
my
last
interview
with
this
terrible
hard
-
hearted
master
,
I
turn
about
,
and
make
a
low
courtesy
,
and
say
,
God
bless
you
,
sir
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
Mr.
Longman
!
<EOS>
and
I
go
into
the
lobby
lead
to
the
great
hall
,
and
dropt
into
the
first
chair
;
for
I
could
get
no
farther
a
good
while
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
all
these
thing
to
your
reflection
,
my
dear
parent
<EOS>
but
I
can
write
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
heart
's
almost
broken
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
 
<EOS>
o
when
shall
I
get
away
!
 
<EOS>
send
me
,
good
God
,
in
safety
,
once
more
to
my
poor
father
's
peaceful
cot
!
 
<EOS>
and
there
the
bad
that
can
happen
will
be
joy
in
perfection
to
what
I
now
bear
!
 
<EOS>
o
pity
                                      
<EOS>
Your
distressed
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
must
write
on
,
though
I
shall
come
so
soon
;
for
now
I
have
hardly
any
thing
else
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
finish
all
that
lie
upon
me
,
and
only
wait
the
good
time
of
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
say
,
I
must
be
low
in
pocket
,
for
what
I
have
lay
out
;
and
so
would
have
present
me
with
two
guinea
of
her
five
;
but
I
could
not
take
them
of
her
,
because
,
poor
gentlewoman
,
she
pay
old
debt
for
her
child
,
that
be
extravagant
,
and
want
them
herself
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
though
,
be
very
good
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
shall
have
but
little
to
bring
with
me
;
but
I
know
you
will
not
,
you
be
so
good
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
work
the
harder
,
when
I
come
home
,
if
I
can
get
a
little
plain
-
work
,
or
any
thing
,
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
your
neighbourhood
be
so
poor
,
that
I
fear
I
shall
want
work
,
except
,
may
be
<EOS>
,
dame
Mumford
can
help
me
to
something
,
from
any
good
family
she
be
acquaint
with
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
what
a
sad
thing
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
bring
up
wrong
,
as
matter
stand
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
you
know
,
my
good
lady
,
now
in
heaven
,
love
singing
and
dancing
;
and
,
as
she
would
have
it
,
I
have
a
voice
,
she
make
me
learn
both
;
and
often
and
often
have
she
make
me
sing
her
an
innocent
song
,
and
a
good
psalm
too
,
and
dance
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
learn
to
flower
and
draw
too
,
and
to
work
fine
work
with
my
needle
;
why
,
all
this
too
I
have
get
pretty
tolerably
at
my
finger
's
end
,
as
they
say
;
and
she
use
to
praise
me
,
and
be
a
good
judge
of
such
matter
.
  
<EOS>
well
now
,
what
be
all
this
to
the
purpose
,
as
thing
have
turn
about
?
  
<EOS>
why
,
no
more
nor
less
,
than
that
I
be
like
the
grasshopper
in
the
fable
,
which
I
have
read
of
in
my
lady
's
book
,
as
follow
:
 
[
see
the
Aesop
's
Fables
which
have
lately
be
select
and
reform
from
those
of
Sir
R.
L'Estrange
,
and
the
most
eminent
mythologist
.
]
  
<EOS>
"
as
the
ant
be
air
their
provision
one
winter
,
a
hungry
grasshopper
(
as
suppose
it
be
poor
<EOS>
I
)
beg
a
charity
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
him
,
that
he
should
have
work
in
summer
,
if
he
would
not
have
want
in
winter
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
the
grasshopper
,
but
I
be
not
idle
neither
;
for
I
sing
out
the
whole
season
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
then
,
say
they
,
you
will
e'en
do
well
to
make
a
merry
year
of
it
,
and
dance
in
winter
to
the
time
you
sing
in
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
shall
make
a
fine
figure
with
my
singing
and
my
dancing
,
when
I
come
home
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
shall
be
unfit
even
for
a
May
-
day
holiday
-
time
;
for
these
minuet
,
rigadoon
,
and
french
dance
,
that
I
have
be
practise
,
will
make
me
but
ill
company
for
my
milk
-
maid
companion
that
be
to
be
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
have
well
,
as
thing
stand
,
have
learn
to
wash
and
scour
,
and
brew
and
bake
,
and
such
like
.
 
<EOS>
Put
<EOS>
I
hope
,
if
I
can
not
get
work
,
and
can
meet
with
a
place
,
to
learn
these
soon
,
if
any
body
will
have
the
goodness
to
bear
with
me
till
I
be
able
:
for
,
notwithstanding
what
my
master
say
,
I
hope
I
have
an
humble
and
teachable
mind
;
and
<EOS>
,
next
to
God
's
grace
,
that
be
all
my
comfort
:
for
I
shall
think
nothing
too
mean
that
be
honest
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
little
hard
at
first
;
but
woe
to
my
proud
heart
,
<EOS>
if
I
find
it
so
on
trial
;
for
I
will
make
it
bend
to
its
condition
,
or
break
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
a
good
bishop
that
be
to
be
burn
for
his
religion
;
and
he
try
how
he
could
bear
it
,
by
put
his
finger
into
the
lighted
candle
:
<EOS>
so
I
,
t'other
day
,
try
,
when
Rachel
's
back
be
turn
,
if
I
could
not
scour
a
pewter
plate
she
have
begin
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
I
could
do't
by
degree
<EOS>
:
It
only
blister
my
hand
in
two
place
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
matter
be
,
if
I
could
get
plain
-
work
enough
,
I
need
not
spoil
my
finger
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
can
not
,
I
hope
to
make
my
hand
as
red
as
a
blood
-
pudding
,
and
as
hard
as
a
beechen
trencher
,
to
accommodate
them
to
my
condition
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
break
off
;
here
be
somebody
come
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
<EOS>
only
our
Hannah
with
a
message
from
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
hold
,
here
be
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
only
Rachel
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
as
much
fright
,
as
be
the
city
mouse
and
the
country
mouse
,
in
the
same
book
of
fable
,
at
every
thing
that
stir
.
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
power
of
these
thing
to
entertain
you
with
in
winter
evening
,
when
I
come
home
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
but
get
work
,
with
a
little
time
for
reading
,
I
hope
we
shall
be
very
happy
over
our
peat
fire
.
  
<EOS>
what
make
me
hint
to
you
,
that
I
should
bring
but
little
with
me
,
be
this
:
  
<EOS>
You

take
all
my
clothe
,
and
all
my
linen
,
and
I
divide
them
into
three
parcel
,
as
I
have
before
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
I
intend
to
do
;
and
I
say
,
It
be
now
Monday
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
I
be
to
go
away
on
Thursday
morning
betime
;
<EOS>
so
,
though
I
know
you
do
not
doubt
my
honesty
,
I
beg
you
will
look
over
my
poor
matter
,
and
let
every
one
have
what
belong
to
them
;
for
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
you
know
I
be
resolve
to
take
with
me
only
what
I
can
properly
call
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
say
she
,
(
I
do
not
know
her
drift
then
;
to
be
sure
she
mean
well
;
but
I
do
not
thank
her
for
it
,
when
I
do
know
it
,
)
<EOS>
let
your
thing
be
bring
down
in
the
green
-
room
,
and
I
will
do
any
thing
you
will
have
me
do
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
my
heart
,
say
I
,
green
-
room
or
any
where
;
but
I
think
you
may
step
up
,
and
see
'em
as
they
lie
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
fetch
'em
down
,
and
lay
them
in
three
parcel
,
as
before
;
<EOS>
and
,
when
I
have
do
,
I
go
down
to
call
her
up
to
look
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
seem
,
she
have
prepare
my
master
for
this
scene
,
unknown
to
me
;
and
in
this
green
-
room
be
a
closet
,
with
a
sash
-
door
,
and
a
curtain
before
it
;
for
there
she
put
her
sweet
-
meat
and
such
thing
;
and
she
do
it
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
to
turn
his
heart
,
as
know
what
I
intend
,
I
suppose
that
he
should
make
me
take
the
thing
;
for
,
if
he
have
,
I
should
have
make
money
of
them
,
to
help
us
when
we
get
together
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
I
could
never
have
appear
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
as
I
be
say
,
he
have
get
,
unknown
to
me
,
into
this
closet
;
I
suppose
while
I
go
to
call
Mrs.
Jervis
:
and
she
since
own
to
me
,
it
be
at
his
desire
,
when
she
tell
him
something
of
what
I
intend
,
or
else
she
would
not
have
do
it
:
though
I
have
reason
,
I
be
sure
,
to
remember
the
last
closet
-
work
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
say
,
when
she
come
up
,
here
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
be
the
first
parcel
;
I
will
spread
it
all
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
thing
my
good
lady
give
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
say
I
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
go
on
describe
the
clothe
and
linen
<EOS>
my
lady
have
give
me
,
mingle
blessing
,
as
I
proceed
,
for
her
goodness
to
me
;
and
when
I
have
turn
over
that
parcel
,
I
say
,
<EOS>
well
,
so
much
for
the
first
parcel
,
Mrs.
Jervis
;
that
be
my
lady
's
gift
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
come
to
the
present
of
my
dear
virtuous
master
:
<EOS>
hey
,

know
closet

that

<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
She
laugh
,
and
say
,
I
never
see
such
a
comical
girl
in
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
but
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
as
soon
as
I
have
open
the
bundle
;
for
I
be
as
brisk
and
as
pert
as
could
be
,
little
thinking
who
hear
me
.
  
<EOS>
now
here
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
be
my
ever
worthy
master
's
present
;
and
then
I
particularise
all
those
in
the
second
bundle
.
  
<EOS>
after
which
,
I
turn
to
my
own
,
and
say
,
  
now
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
come
poor
Pamela
's
bundle
;
and
a
little
one
it
be

other

<EOS>
first
,
here
be
a
calico
nightgown
,
that
I
use
to
wear
o

.
 
<EOS>
'
Twill
be
rather
too
good
for
me
when
I
get
home
;
but
I
must
have
something
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
quilted
calamanco
coat
,
and
a
pair
of
stocking
I
buy
of
the
pedlar
,
and
my
straw
-
hat
with
blue
string
;
and
a
remnant
of
Scots
cloth
,
which
will
make
two
shirt
and
two
shift
,
the
same

have

,
for
my
poor
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
be
four
other
shift

fellow
to
that
I
have
on
;
another
pretty
good
one
,
and
the
other
two
old
fine
one
,
that
will
serve
me
to
turn
and
wind
with
at
home
,
for
they
be
not
worth
leave
behind
me
;
and
here
be
two
pair
of
shoe
<EOS>
,
I
have
take
the
lace
off
,
which
I
will
burn
,
and
may
be
will
fetch
me
some
little
matter
at
a
pinch
,
with
an
old
silver
buckle
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
what
do
you
laugh
for
,
Mrs.
Jervis
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
<EOS>
why
you
be
like
an
April
day
;
you
cry
and
laugh
in
a
breath
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
let
me
see
;
ay
,
here
be
a
cotton
handkerchief
I
buy
of
the
pedlar
 
there
should
be
another
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
here
it
be
!
<EOS>
and
here
too
be
my
new
-
buy
knit
mitten
;
and
this
be
my
new
flannel
coat
,
the
fellow
to
that
I
have
on
and
in
this
parcel
,
pin
together
,
be
several
piece
of
print
calico
,
remnant
of
silk
,
and
such
like
,
that
,
if
good
luck
should
happen
,
and
I
should
get
work
,
would
serve
for
robin
and
facing
,
and
such
like
use
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
too
be
a
pair
of
pocket
:
they
be
too
fine
for
me
;
but
I
have
no
bad
.
 
<EOS>
bless
me
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
have
so
many
good
thing
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
you
have
see
all
my
store
,
and
I
will
now
sit
down
,
and
tell
you
a
piece
of
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
be
brief
then
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
my
good
girl
:
for
she
be
afraid
,
she
say
afterwards
,
that
I
should
say
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
why
then
the
case
be
this
:
I
be
to
enter
upon
a
point
of
equity
and
conscience
,
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
I
must
beg
,
<EOS>
if
you
love
me
,
you
would
let
me
have
my
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
those
thing
there
of
my
lady
's
,
I
can
have
no
claim
to
,
so
as
to
take
them
away
;
for
she
give
them
me
,
suppose
I
be
to
wear
them
in
her
service
,
and
to
do
credit
to
her
bountiful
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
since
I
be
to
be
turn
away
,
you
know
,
I
can
not
wear
them
at
my
poor
father
's
;
for
I
should
bring
all
the
little
village
upon
my
back
;
and
so
I
resolve
not
to
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
I
have
far
less
right
to
these
of
my
worthy
master
's
;
for
you
see
what
be
his
intention
in
give
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
be
to
be
the
price
of
my
shame
,
and
if
I
could
make
use
of
them
,
I
should
think
I
should
never
prosper
with
them
;
and
,
besides
,
you
know
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
if
I
would
not
do
the
good
gentleman
's
work
,
why
should
I
take
his
wage
?
 
<EOS>
so
,
in
conscience
,
in
honour
,
in
every
thing
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
thee
,
thou
second
wicked
bundle
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
say
I
,
cone
to
my
arm
,
my
dear
third
parcel
,
the
companion
of
my
poverty
,
and
the
witness
of
my
honesty
;
and
may
I
never
deserve
the
least
rag
that
be
contain
in
thee
,
when
I
forfeit
a
title
to
that
innocence
,
that
I
hope
will
ever
be
the
pride
of
my
life
!
<EOS>
and
then
I
be
sure
it
will
be
my
high
comfort
at
my
death
,
when
all
the
rich
and
pomp
of
the
world
will
be
bad
than
the
vile
rag
that
can
be
wear
by
beggar
!
<EOS>
and
so
I
hug
my
third
bundle
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
say
I
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
(
<EOS>
and
she
weep
to
hear
me
,
)
<EOS>
one
thing
more
<EOS>
I
have
to
trouble
you
with
,
and
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
four
guinea
,
you
know
,
<EOS>
that
come
out
of
my
good
lady
's
pocket
<EOS>
,
when
she
die
;
that
,
with
some
silver
,
my
master
give
me
:
<EOS>
now
these
same
four
guinea
I
send
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
,
and
they
have
break
them
;
but
would
make
them
up
,
if
I
would
:
and
if
you
think
it
should
be
so
,
it
shall
.
 
<EOS>
but
pray
tell
me
honestly
your
mind
:
<EOS>
as
to
the
three
year
before
my
lady
's
death
,
do
you
think
,
as
I
have
no
wage
,
I
may
be
suppose
to
be
quit
?
 
<EOS>
by
quit
,
I
can
not
mean
that
my
poor
service
should
be
equal
to
my
lady
's
goodness
;
for
that
be
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
all
her
learning
and
education
of
me
,
as
matter
have
turn
,
will
be
of
little
service
to
me
now
;
for
it
have
be
well
for
me
to
have
be
bring
up
to
hard
labour
,
to
be
sure
;
for
that
I
must
turn
to
at
last
,
if
I
can
not
get
a
place
:
(
and
you
know
,
in
place
too
,
one
be
subject
to
such
temptation
as
be
dreadful
to
think
of
:
)
<EOS>
so
,
I
say
,
by
quit
<EOS>
I
only
mean
,
as
I
return
all
the
good
thing
she
give
me
,
whether
I
may
not
set
my
little
service
against
my
keeping
;
because
,
as
I
say
,
my
learning
be
not
now
in
the
question
;
and
I
be
sure
my
dear
good
lady
would
have
think
so
,
have
she
live
;
but
that
too
be
now
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
if
so
,
I
would
ask
,
whether
,
in
above
this
year
that
I
have
live
with
my
master
,
as
I
be
resolve
to
leave
all
his
gift
behind
me
,
I
may
not
have
earn
,
besides
my
keeping
,
these
four
guinea
,
and
these
poor
clothe
here
upon
my
back
,
and
in
my
third
bundle
?
 
<EOS>
now
tell
me
your
mind
freely
,
without
favour
or
affection
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
girl
,
say
she
,
you
make
me
unable
to
speak
to
you
at
all
:
to
be
sure
it
will
be
the
high
affront
that
can
be
offer
,
for
you
to
leave
any
of
these
thing
behind
you
;
and
you
must
take
all
your
bundle
with
you
,
or
my
master
will
never
forgive
you
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
I
do
not
care
;
I
have
be
too
much
use
to
be
snub
and
hardly
treat
by
my
master
,
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
him
no
harm
;
and
I
shall
always
pray
for
him
and
wish
him
happy
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
deserve
these
thing
;
I
know
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
I
can
not
wear
them
,
if
I
should
take
them
;
so
they
can
be
of
no
use
to
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
trust
I
shall
not
want
the
poor
pittance
<EOS>
,
that
is
all
I
desire
to
keep
life
and
soul
together
.
 
<EOS>
bread
and
water
I
can
live
upon
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
with
content
.
<EOS>
water
I
shall
get
any
where
;
and
if
I
can
not
get
me
bread
,
I
will
live
like
a
bird
in
winter
upon
hip
and
haw
,
and
at
other
time
upon
pig
-
nut
and
potato
,
or
turnip
,
or
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
so
what
occasion
have
I
for
these
thing
?
 
<EOS>
but
all
I
ask
be
about
these
four
guinea
,
and
if
you
think
I
need
not
return
them
,
that
be
all
I
want
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
you
need
not
,
say
she
;
you
have
well
earn
them
by
that
waistcoat
only
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
think
not
so
,
in
that
only
;
but
in
the
linen
,
and
other
thing
,
do
you
think
I
have
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
say
she
,
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
keeping
allow
for
<EOS>
,
I
mean
,
say
I
,
and
these
poor
clothe
on
my
back
,
besides
?
 
<EOS>
remember
that
,
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear
odd
-
one
,
no
doubt
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
say
I
,
I
be
as
happy
as
a
princess
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
as
rich
as
I
wish
to
be
:
and
once
more
,
my
dear
third
bundle
,
I
will
hug
thee
to
my
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
beg
you
will
say
nothing
of
all
this
till
I
be
go
,
that
my
master
may
not
be
so
angry
,
but
that
I
may
go
in
peace
;
for
my
heart
,
without
other
matter
,
will
he
ready
to
break
to
part
with
you
all
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
say
I
,
as
to
one
matter
more
:
and
that
be
my
master
's
last
usage
of
me
,
before
Mr.
Longman
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
,
Pr'ythee
,
dear
Pamela
,
step
to
my
chamber
,
and
fetch
me
a
paper
I
leave
on
my
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
shew
you
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
say
I
,
and
step
down
;
but
that
be
only
a
fetch
,
to
take
the
order
of
my
master
,
I
find
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
he
say
,
he
think
two
or
three
time
to
have
burst
out
upon
me
;
but
he
could
not
stand
it
,
and
wish
I
may
not
know
he
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
trip
up
again
so
nimbly
,
(
for
there
be
no
paper
,
)
<EOS>
that
I
just
see
his
back
,
as
if
come
out
of
that
green
-
room
,
and
go
into
the
next
to
it
,
the
first
door
that
be
open
 
<EOS>
I

and

<EOS>
o
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
what
have
you
do
by
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
I
can
not
confide
in
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
beset
on
all
hand
.
 
<EOS>
wretched
,
wretched
Pamela
,
where
shalt
thou
expect
a
friend
,
if
Mrs.
Jervis
join
to
betray
thee
thus
?
 
<EOS>
She
make
so
many
protestation
,
(
tell
me
all
,
and
that
he
own
I
have
make
him
wipe
his
eye
two
or
three
time
,
and
say
she
hope
it
would
have
a
good
effect
,
and
remember
me
,
that
I
have
say
nothing
but
what
would
rather
move
compassion
than
resentment
,
)
that
I
forgave
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
o
!
<EOS>
that
I
be
safe
from
this
house
!
<EOS>
for
never
poor
creature
sure
be
so
fluster
as
I
have
be
so
many
month
together
;
 
I
be
call
down
from
this
most
tedious
scribble
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
will
next
befall
                          
<EOS>
Your

<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
say
,
she
be
sure
I
shall
have
the
chariot
to
carry
me
home
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
though
this
will
look
too
great
for
me
,
yet
it
will
shew
as
if
I
be
not
turn
away
quite
in
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
the
travel
chariot
be
come
from
Lincolnshire
,
and
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
shall
go
in
that
;
for
the
other
be
quite
grand
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
write
again
,
though
,
may
be
,
I
shall
bring
it
to
you
in
my
pocket
:
<EOS>
for
I
shall
have
no
writing
,
nor
writing
-
time
,
I
hope
,
when
I
come
to
you

<EOS>
this
be
Wednesday
morning
,
and
I
shall
,
I
hope
,
set
out
to
you
to
-
morrow
morning
;
but
I
have
have
more
trial
and
more
vexation
;
but
of
another
complexion
too
a
little
,
though
all
from
the
same
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
yesterday
my
master
,
after
he
come
from
hunting
,
send
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
with
great
terror
:
<EOS>
for
I
expect
he
would
storm
,
and
be
in
a
fine
passion
with
me
for
my
freedom
of
speech
before
:
<EOS>
so
I
be
resolve
to
begin
first
,
with
submission
,
to
disarm
his
anger
;
and
I
fall
upon
my
knee
as
soon
as
I
see
him
;
and
say
,
good
sir
,
let
me
beseech
you
,
as
you
hope
to
be
forgive
yourself
,
and
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
good
lady
your
mother
,
who
recommend
me
to
you
with
her
last
word
,
to
forgive
me
all
my
fault
;
and
only
grant
me
this
favour
,
the
last
I
shall
ask
you
,
that
you
will
let
me
depart
your
house
with
peace
and
quietness
of
mind
,
that
I
may
take
such
a
leave
of
my
dear
fellow
-
servant
as
befit
me
;
and
that
my
heart
be
not
quite
broken
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
me
up
,
in
a
kind
manner
than
ever
I
have
know
;
and
he
say
,
Shut

Pamela
,
and
come
to
me
in
my
closet
:

<EOS>

<EOS>
and

<EOS>

<EOS>
Shut

<EOS>
He
then
go

which
be

and
full
of

and
next
the
private
garden

<EOS>
I
shut
the
parlour
door
,
as
he
bid

but
stand
at
it
irresolute
.
 
<EOS>
place
some
confidence
in
me
<EOS>
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
surely

may
,
when
I
have
speak
thus
solemnly
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
creep
towards
him
with
tremble
foot
,
and
my
heart
throb
through
my
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
come
in
,
say
he
,
when
I
bid
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Pray

.
 
<EOS>
I
will

say

as
I
hope
to
be

<EOS>
He
sit
down
upon
a
rich
settee
;
and
take
hold
of
my
hand
,
and
say
,
do
not
doubt
me
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
moment
I
will
no
more
consider
you
as
my
servant
:
and
I
desire
you
will
not
use
me
with
ingratitude
for
the
kindness
I
be
go
to
express
towards
you
.
 
<EOS>
this
a
little
embolden
me
;
and
<EOS>
he
say
,
hold
both
my
hand
between
his
,
You
have
too
much
wit
and
good
sense
not
to
discover
,
that
I
,
in
spite
of
my
heart
,
and
all
the
pride
of
it
,
can
not
but
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
look
up
to
me
,
my
sweet
-
faced
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
say
I
love
you
;
and
have
put
on
a
behaviour
to
you
,
that
be
much
against
my
heart
,
in
hope
to
frighten
you
from
your
reservedness
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
I
own
it
ingenuously
;
and
do
not
play
your
sex
upon
me
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
unable
to
speak
;
and
he
,
see
me
too
much
oppress
with
confusion
to
go
on
in
that
strain
,
say
,
well
,
Pamela
,
let
me
know
in
what
situation
of
life
be
your
father
:
<EOS>
I
know
he
be
a
poor
man
;
but
be
he
as
low
and
as
honest
as
he
be
when
my
mother
take
you
?
  
<EOS>
then
I
could
speak
a
little
;
and
with
a
down
look
,
(
and
I
feel
my
face
glow
like
fire
,
)
<EOS>
I
say
,
yes
,
<EOS>
sir
,
as
poor
and
as
honest
too
;
and
that
be
my
pride
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
I
will
do
something
for
him
,
if
it
be
not
your
fault
,
and
make
all
your
family
happy
.
 
<EOS>
all
,
sir
,
say
I
,
he
be
happy
already
than
ever
he
can
be
,
if
his
daughter
's
innocence
be
to
be
the
price
of
your
favour
:
<EOS>
and
I
beg
<EOS>
you
will
not
speak
to
me
on
the
only
side
that
can
wound
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
design
of
that
sort
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
say
I
,
tell
me
not
so
,
tell
me
not
so
!
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
easy
,
say
he
,
for
me
to
be
the
making
of
your
father
,
without
injure
you
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
I
,
if
this
can
be
do
,
let
me
know
how
;
and
all
I
can
do
with
innocence
shall
be
the
study
and
practice
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
o
!
<EOS>
what
can
such
a
poor
creature
as
I
do
,
and
do
my
duty
?
 
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
you
stay
a
week
or
fortnight
only
,
and
behave
yourself
with
kindness
to
me
;
I
stoop
to
beg
it
of
you
,
and
you
shall
see
all
shall
turn
out
beyond
your
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
say
he
,
you
be
go
to
answer
otherwise
than
I
would
have
you
;
and
I
begin
to
be
vex
<EOS>
I
should
thus
meanly
sue
;
<EOS>
and
so
I
will
say
,
that
your
behaviour
before
honest
Longman
,
when
I
use
you
as
I
do
,
and
you
could
so
well
have
vindicate
yourself
,
have
quite
charm
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
I
be
not
pleased
with
all
you
say
yesterday
,
while
I
be
in
the
closet
,
yet
you
have
move
me
more
to
admire
you
than
before
;
and
I
be
awaken
to
see
more
worthiness
in
you
,
than
ever
I
see
in
any
lady
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
all
the
servant
,
from
the
high
to
the
low
,
doat
upon
you
,
instead
of
envy
you
;
and
look
upon
you
in
so
superior
a
light
,
as
speak
what
you
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
more
of
your
letter
than
you
imagine
,
(
this
surprise
me
!
)
and
be
quite
overcome
with
your
charming
manner
of
writing
,
so
free
,
so
easy
,
and
many
of
your
sentiment
so
much
above
your
year
,
and
your
sex
;
and
all
put
together
,
make
me
,
as
I
tell
you
,
love
you
to
extravagance
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Pamela
,
when
I
have
stoop
to
acknowledge
all
this
,
oblige
me
only
to
stay
another
week
or
fortnight
,
to
give
me
time
to
bring
about
some
certain
affair
,
and
you
shall
see
how
much
you
may
find
your
account
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
find
my
poor
heart
give
way
.
 
<EOS>
o
good
sir
,
say
I
,
spare
a
poor
girl
that
can
not
look
up
to
you
,
and
speak
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
be
full
;
and
why
should
you
wish
to
undo
me
?
 
<EOS>
only
oblige
me
,
say
he
,
to
stay
a
fortnight
longer
,
and
John
shall
carry
word
to
your
father
,
that
I
will
see
him
in
the
time
,
either
here
,
or
at
the
Swan
in
his
village
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
say
I
,
my
heart
will
burst
;
but
,
on
my
bended
knee
,
I
beg
you
to
let
me
go
to
-
morrow
,
as
I
design
:
and
do
not
offer
to
tempt
a
poor
creature
,
whose
whole
will
would
be
to
do
yours
,
if
my
virtue
would
permit
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
permit
it
,
say
he
;
for
I
intend
no
injury
to
you
,
God
be
my
witness
!
 
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
say
I
;
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
sir
,
believe
you
,
after
what
have
pass
:
how
many
way
be
there
to
undo
poor
creature
!
 
<EOS>
Good
God
,
protect
me
this
one
time
,
and
send
me
but
to
my
dear
father
's
cot
in
safety
!
 
<EOS>
strange
,
d####d
fate
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
that
when
I
speak
so
solemnly
,
I
can
not
be
believe
!
 
<EOS>
what
should
I
believe
,
sir
?
<EOS>
say
I
,
what
can
I
believe
?
 
<EOS>
what
have
you
say
,
but
that
I
be
to
stay
a
fortnight
longer
?
<EOS>
and
what
then
be
to
become
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
My
pride
of
birth
and
fortune
<EOS>
(
d####n
them
both
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
since
they
can
not
obtain
credit
with
you
,
but
must
add
to
your
suspicion
)
<EOS>
will
not
let
me
descend
all
at
once
;
and
I
ask
you
but
a
fortnight
's
stay
,
that
,
after
this
declaration
,
I
may
pacify
those
proud
demand
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
my
heart
throb
!
<EOS>
and
I
begin
(
for
I
do
not
know
what
I
do
)
to
say
the
Lord
's
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
your
bead
to
me
Pamela
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
thou
art
a
perfect
nun
<EOS>
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
say
aloud
,
with
my
eye
lift
up
to
heaven
,
lead
me
not
into
temptation
:
but
deliver
me
from
evil
,
o
my
good
God
!
 
<EOS>
He
hug
me
in
his
arm
,
and
say
,
well
,
my
dear
girl
,
then
you
stay
this
fortnight
,
and
you
shall
see
what
I
will
do
for
you
 
<EOS>
I
will
leave
you
a
moment
,
and
walk
into
the
next
room
,
to
give
you
time
to
think
of
it
,
and
to
shew
you
I
have
no
design
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
this
,
I
think
,
do
not
look
amiss
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
out
,
and
I
be
torture
with
twenty
different
doubt
in
a
minute
;
sometimes
I
think
that
to
stay
a
week
or
fortnight
longer
in
this
house
to
obey
him
,
while
Mrs.
Jervis
be
with
me
,
could
do
no
great
harm
:
<EOS>
but
then
,
think
I
,
how
do
I
know
what
I
may
be
able
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
withstand
his
anger
;
but
may
I
not
relent
at
his
kindness
?
 
<EOS>
how
shall
I
stand
that
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
hope
,
think
<EOS>
I
,
by
the
same
protect
grace
in
which
I
will
always
confide
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
then
,
what
have
he
promise
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
he
will
make
my
poor
father
and
mother
's
life
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
o
!
say
I
to
myself
,
that
be
a
rich
thought
;
but
let
me
not
dwell
upon
it
,
for
fear
I
should
indulge
it
to
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
he
do
for
me
,
poor
girl
as
I
be
!
  
<EOS>
w
hat
can
his
greatness
stoop
to
!
 
<EOS>
He
talk
,
think
I
,
of
his
pride
of
heart
,
and
pride
of
condition
;
o
these
be
in
his
head
,
and
in
his
heart
too
,
or
he
would
not
confess
them
to
me
at
such
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
think
I
,
this
can
be
only
to
seduce
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
promise
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
to
see
what
he
will
do
,
if
I
stay
a
fortnight
;
and
this
fortnight
,
think
I
again
,
be
no
such
great
matter
;
and
I
shall
see
in
a
few
day
how
he
carry
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
when
I
again
reflect
upon
this
distance
between
him
and
me
,
and
his
now
open
declaration
of
love
,
as
he
call
it
;
and
that
after
this
he
would
talk
with
me
on
that
subject
more
plainly
than
ever
,
and
I
shall
be
less
armed
,
may
be
,
to
withstand
him
;
and
then
I
bethink
myself
,
why
,
if
he
mean
no
dishonour
,
he
should
not
speak
before
Mrs.
Jervis
;
and
the
odious
frightful
closet
come
again
into
my
head
,
and
my
narrow
escape
upon
it
;
and
how
easy
it
may
be
for
him
to
send
Mrs.
Jervis
and
the
maid
out
of
the
way
;
and
so
that
all
the
mischief
he
design
me
may
be
bring
about
in
less
than
that
time
;
I
resolve
to
go
away
and
trust
all
to
Providence
,
and
nothing
to
myself
.
<EOS>
and
how
ought
I
to
be
thankful
for
this
resolution
!
 
<EOS>
as
you
shall
hear
.
  
<EOS>
but
just
as
I
have
writ
to
this
place
<EOS>
,
John
send
me
word
,
that
he
be
go
this
minute
your
way
;
and
so
I
will
send
you
so
far
as
I
have
write
,
and
hope
by
to
-
morrow
night
,
to
ask
your
blessing
,
at
your
own
poor
,
but
happy
abode
,
and
tell
you
the
rest
by
word
of
mouth
;
and
so
I
rest
,
till
then
,
and
for
ever
,
              
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
will
continue
my
writing
still
,
because
,
may
be
,
I
shall
like
to
read
it
,
when
I
be
with
you
,
to
see
what
danger
I
have
be
enable
to
escape
;
and
though
I
bring
it
along
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
you
my
resolution
,
my
happy
resolution
as
I
have
reason
to
think
it
:
<EOS>
and
just
then
he
come
in
again
,
with
great
kindness
in
his
look
,
and
say
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
Pamela
,
you
will
stay
this
fortnight
to
oblige
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
frame
my
word
so
as
to
deny
,
and
yet
not
make
him
storm
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
I
,
Forgive
,
sir
,
your
poor
distressed
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
can
not
possibly
deserve
any
favour
at
your
hand
,
consistent
with
virtue
;
and
I
beg
you
will
let
me
go
to
my
poor
father
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
thou
art
the
veri
fool
that
I
ever
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
will
see
your
father
;
I
will
send
for
him
hither
to
-
morrow
,
in
my
travel
chariot
,
if
you
will
;
and
I
will
let
him
know
what
I
intend
to
do
for
him
and
you
.
<EOS>
what
,
sir
,
may
I
ask
you
,
can
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
's
noble
estate
may
easily
make
him
happy
,
and
not
unuseful
,
perhaps
to
you
,
in
some
respect
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
price
be
I
to
pay
for
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
Yon
shall
be
happy
as
you
can
wish
,
say
he
,
I
do
assure
you
:
<EOS>
and
here
I
will
now
give
you
this
purse
,
in
which
be
fifty
guinea
,
which
I
will
allow
your
father
yearly
,
and
find
an
employ
suitable
to
his
liking
,
to
deserve
that
and
more
:
Pamela
,
he
shall
never
want
,
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
you
still
more
for
him
,
but
that
,
perhaps
,
you
would
suspect
I
intend
it
as
a
design
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
take
back
your
guinea
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
touch
one
,
nor
will
my
father
,
I
be
sure
,
till
he
know
what
be
to
be
do
for
them
;
and
particularly
what
be
to
become
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
suppose
I
find
a
man
of
probity
,
and
genteel
calling
,
for
a
husband
for
you
,
that
shall
make
you
a
gentlewoman
as
long
as
you
live
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
no
husband
,
sir
,
say
I
:
for
now
I
begin
to
see
him
in
all
his
black
colour
!
 
<EOS>
yet
be
so
much
in
his
power
,
I
think
I
would
a
little
dissemble
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
you
be
so
pretty
,
<EOS>
that
go
where
you
will
<EOS>
,
you
can
never
be
free
from
the
design
of
some
or
other
of
our
sex
;
and
I
shall
think
I
do
not
answer
the
care
of
my
die
mother
for
you
,
who
commit
you
to
me
,
if
I
do
not
provide
you
a
husband
to
protect
your
virtue
,
and
your
innocence
;
and
a
worthy
one
I
have
think
of
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
o
black
,
perfidious
creature
!
<EOS>
think
I
,
what
an
implement
art
thou
in
the
hand
of
Lucifer
,
to
ruin
the
innocent
heart
!
 
<EOS>
yet
still
I
dissemble
:
<EOS>
for
I
fear
much
both
him
and
the
place
I
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whom
,
pray
sir
,
have
you
think
of
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
young
Mr.
Williams
,
my
chaplain
,
in
Lincolnshire
,
who
will
make
you
happy
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
know
,
sir
,
say
I
,
any
thing
of
your
honour
's
intention
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
my
girl
,
say
he
,
and
kiss
me
,
(
much
against
my
will
;
for
his
very
breath
be
now
poison
to
me
,
)
but
his
dependance
upon
my
favour
,
and
your
beauty
and
merit
,
will
make
him
rejoice
at
my
kindness
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
I
,
then
it
be
time
enough
to
consider
of
this
matter
;
and
it
can
not
hinder
me
from
go
to
my
father
's
:
for
what
will
stay
a
fortnight
longer
signify
to
this
?
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
's
care
and
goodness
may
extend
to
me
there
,
as
well
as
here
;
and
Mr.
Williams
,
and
all
the
world
,
shall
know
that
I
be
not
ashamed
of
my
father
's
poverty
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
kiss
me
again
,
and
I
say
,
if
I
be
to
think
of
Mr.
Williams
,
or
any
body
,
I
beg
you
will
not
be
so
free
with
me
:
<EOS>
that
be
not
pretty
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
but
you
stay
this
next
fortnight
,
and
in
that
time
I
will
have
both
Williams
and
your
father
here
;
for
I
will
have
the
match
conclude
in
my
house
;
and
when
I
have
bring
it
on
,
you
shall
settle
it
as
you
please
together
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
take
and
send
only
these
fifty
piece
to
your
father
,
as
an
earnest
of
my
favour
,
and
I
will
make
you
all
happy
.
  
<EOS>
S
ir
,
say
I
,
I
beg
at
least
two
hour
to
consider
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
say
he
,
be
go
out
in
one
hour
;
and
I
would
have
you
write
to
your
father
what
I
propose
;
and
John
shall
carry
it
on
purpose
:
and
he
shall
take
the
purse
with
him
for
the
good
old
man
,
if
you
approve
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
will
then
let
you
know
in
one
hour
my
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
do
so
,
say
he
;
and
give
me
another
kiss
,
and
let
nee
go
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
I
rejoice
I
have
get
out
of
his
clutch
!
 
<EOS>
so
I
write
you
this
,
that
you
may
see
how
matter
stand
;
for
I
be
resolve
to
come
away
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Base
,
wicked
,
treacherous
gentleman
as
he
be
!
  
<EOS>
so
here
be
a
trap
lay
for
your
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
o
what
a
scene
of
wickedness
be
here
lay
down
for
all
my
wretched
life
!
<EOS>
black
-
hearted
wretch
!
<EOS>
how
I
hate
him
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
at
first
,
as
you
will
see
by
what
I
have
write
,
he
would
have
make
me
believe
other
thing
;
and
this
of
Mr.
Williams
,
I
suppose
,
come
into
his
head
after
he
walk
out
from
his
closet
,
to
give
himself
time
to
think
how
to
delude
me
better
:
but
the
covering
be
now
too
thin
,
and
easy
to
be
see
through
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
chamber
,
and
the
first
thing
I
do
be
to
write
to
him
;
for
I
think
it
be
good
not
to
see
him
again
,
if
I
could
help
it
;
and
I
put
it
under
his
parlour
door
,
after
I
have
copy
it
,
as
follow
:
  
"
HONOURED
SIR
,
  
"
Your
last
proposal
to
me
convince
me
,
that
I
ought
not
to
stay
,
but
to
go
to
my
father
,
if
it
be
but
to
ask
his
advice
about
Mr.
Williams
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
set
upon
it
,
that
I
be
not
to
be
persuade
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
honour
sir
,
with
a
thousand
thank
for
all
favour
,
I
will
set
out
to
-
morrow
early
;
and
the
honour
you
design
me
,
as
Mrs.
Jervis
tell
me
,
of
your
chariot
,
there
will
be
no
occasion
for
:
because
I
can
hire
,
I
believe
,
farmer
Brady
's
chaise
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
beg
you
will
not
take
it
amiss
<EOS>
,
I
shall
ever
be
                        
"
Your
dutiful
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
as
to
the
purse
,
sir
,
my
poor
father
,
to
be
sure
,
will
not
forgive
me
,
if
I
take
it
,
till
he
can
know
how
to
deserve
it
which
be
impossible
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
he
have
just
now
send
Mrs.
Jervis
to
tell
me
,
that
since
I
be
resolve
to
go
,
go
I
may
,
and
the
travel
chariot
shall
be
ready
;
but
it
shall
be
bad
for
me
;
for
that
he
will
never
trouble
himself
about
me
as
long
as
he
live
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
so
I
get
out
of
the
house
<EOS>
,
I
care
not
;
only
I
should
have
be
glad
I
could
,
with
innocence
,
have
make
you
,
my
dear
parent
,
happy
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
the
reason
of
it
,
but
John
,
who
I
think
be
go
with
my
last
,
be
but
now
go
;
and
he
send
to
know
if
I
have
any
thing
else
to
carry
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
break
off
to
send
you
this
with
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
prepare
for
my
journey
,
and
about
take
leave
of
my
good
fellow
-
servant
:
and
if
I
have
not
time
to
write
,
I
must
tell
you
the
rest
,
when
I
be
so
happy
as
to
be
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
one
word
more
:
I
slip
in
a
paper
of
verse
,
on
my
going
:
sad
poor
stuff
!
<EOS>
but
as
they
come
from
me
,
you
will
not
dislike
them
,
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
shew
them
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
she
like
them
,
and
take
a
copy
;
and
make
one
sing
them
to
her
,
and
in
the
green
-
room
too
;
but
I
look
into
the
closet
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
,
that
I
be
             
Your
dutiful
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
just
say
,
that
he
have
this
moment
send
me
five
guinea
by
Mrs.
Jervis
,
as
a
present
for
my
pocket
:
<EOS>
so
I
shall
be
very
rich
;
for
as
she
bring
them
,
I
think
I
may
take
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
will
not
see
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
may
go
when
I
will
in
the
morning
;
and
Lincolnshire
Robin
shall
drive
me
:
but
he
be
so
angry
<EOS>
,
he
order
that
nobody
shall
go
out
at
the
door
with
me
,
not
so
much
as
into
the
coach
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
,
not
I
!
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
this
expose
himself
more
than
me
?
  
<EOS>
but
John
wait
,
and
I
would
have
bring
this
and
the
other
myself
;
but
he
say
,
he
have
put
it
up
among
other
thing
,
and
so
can
take
both
as
well
as
one
.
  
<EOS>
John
be
very
good
,
and
very
honest
;
I
be
under
great
obligation
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
him
a
guinea
,
now
I
be
so
rich
,
if
I
think
he
would
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
of
my
lady
's
clothe
,
and
those
my
master
give
me
:
for
I
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
,
I
would
not
take
them
;
but
I
fancy
,
by
a
word
or
two
that
be
drop
,
they
will
be
send
after
me
.
 
<EOS>
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
what
a
rich
Pamela
you
will
have
if
they
should
!
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
can
not
wear
them
if
they
do
,
I
do
not
desire
them
;
and
if
I
have
them
,
will
turn
them
into
money
,
as
I
can
have
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
no
more
 
I
be
in
a
fearful
hurry
!

for
all
your

here
it
be
necessary
the
reader
should
know
,
that
the
fair
Pamela
's
trial
be
not
yet
over
;
but
the
bad
be
to
come
,
at
a
time
when
she
think
them
at
an
end
,
and
that
she
be
return
to
her
father
:
for
when
her
master
find
her
virtue
be
not
to
be
subdue
,
and
he
have
in
vain
try
to
conquer
his
passion
for
her
,
be
a
gentleman
of
pleasure
and
intrigue
,
he
have
order
his
Lincolnshire
coachman
to
bring
his
travel
chariot
from
thence
,
not
care
to
trust
his
Bedfordshire
coachman
,
who
,
with
the
rest
of
the
servant
,
so
greatly
love
and
honour
the
fair
damsel
;
and
have
give
him
instruction
accordingly
,
and
prohibit
the
other
servant
,
on
pretence
of
resent
Pamela
's
behaviour
,
from
accompany
her
any
part
of
the
road
,
he
drive
her
five
mile
on
the
way
to
her
father
's
;
and
then
turn
off
,
cross
the
country
,
and
carry
her
onwards
toward
his
Lincolnshire
estate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
also
to
be
observe
,
that
the
messenger
of
her
letter
to
her
father
,
who
so
often
pretend
business
that
way
,
be
an
implement
in
his
master
's
hand
,
and
employ
by
him
for
that
purpose
;
and
always
give
her
letter
first
to
him
,
and
his
master
use
to
open
and
read
them
,
and
then
send
them
on
;
by
which
mean
,
as
he
hint
to
her
,
(
as
she
observe
in
her
letter
XXX
)
<EOS>
he
be
no
stranger
to
what
she
write
.
 
<EOS>
thus
every
way
be
the
poor
virgin
beset
:
<EOS>
and
the
whole
will
shew
the
base
art
of
design
man
to
gain
their
wicked
end
;
and
how
much
it
behove
the
fair
sex
to
stand
upon
their
guard
against
artful
contrivance
,
especially
when
riches
and
power
conspire
against
innocence
and
a
low
estate
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
word
more
will
be
necessary
to
make
the
sequel
better
understand
.
<EOS>
the
intriguing
gentleman
think
fit
,
however
,
to
keep
back
from
her
father
her
three
last
letter
;
in
which
she
mention
his
conceal
himself
to
hear
her
partition
out
her
clothe
,
his
last
effort
to
induce
her
to
stay
a
fortnight
,
his
pretended
proposal
of
the
chaplain
,
and
her
hope
of
speedily
see
them
,
as
also
her
verse
;
and
to
send
himself
a
letter
to
her
father
,
which
be
as

GOODMAN

You
will
wonder
to
receive
a
letter
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
be
oblige
to
let
you
know
,
that
I
have
discover
the
strange
correspondence
carry
on
between
you
and
your
daughter
,
so
injurious
to
my
honour
and
reputation
,
and
which
,
I
think
,
you
should
not
have
encourage
,
till
you
know
there
be
sufficient
ground
for
those
aspersion
,
which
she
so
plentifully
cast
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
something
possibly
there
may
be
in
what
she
have
write
from
time
to
time
;
but
,
believe
me
,
with
all
her
pretended
simplicity
and
innocence
,
I
never
know
so
much
romantic
invention
as
she
be
mistress
of
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
girl
's
head
be
turn
by
romance
,
and
such
idle
stuff
,
to
which
she
have
give
herself
up
,
ever
since
her
kind
lady
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
assume
air
,
as
if
she
be
a
mirror
of
perfection
,
and
every
body
have
a
design
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
mistake
me
,
however
;
I
believe
her
very
honest
,
and
very
virtuous
;
but
I
have
find
out
also
,
that
she
be
carry
on
a
sort
of
correspondence
,
or
love
affair
,
with
a
young
clergyman
,
that
I
hope
in
time
to
provide
for
;
but
who
,
at
present
,
be
destitute
of
any
subsistence
but
my
favour
:
<EOS>
and
what
would
be
the
consequence
,
can
you
think
,
of
two
young
folk
,
who
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
trust
to
of
their
own
to
come
together
with
a
family
multiply
upon
them
before
they
have
bread
to
eat
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
my
part
,
I
have
too
much
kindness
to
them
both
,
not
to
endeavour
to
prevent
it
,
if
I
can
;
and
for
this
reason
I
have
send
her
out
of
his
way
for
a
little
while
,
till
I
can
bring
them
both
to
well
consideration
;
and
I
would
not
,
therefore
,
have
you
be
surprised
you
do
not
see
your
daughter
so
soon
as
you
may
possibly
expect
.
  
<EOS>
"
yet
I
do
assure
you
,
upon
my
honour
,
that
she
shall
be
safe
and
inviolate
;
and
I
hope
you
do
not
doubt
me
,
notwithstanding
any
air
she
may
have
give
herself
,
upon
my
jocular
pleasantry
to
her
,
and
perhaps
a
little
innocent
romp
with
her
,
so
usual
with
young
folk
of
the
two
sex
,
when
they
have
be
long
acquaint
,
and
grow
up
together
;
for
pride
be
not
my
talent
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
she
be
a
mighty
letter
-
writer
,
I
hope
she
have
have
the
duty
to
apprise
you
of
her
intrigue
with
the
young
clergyman
;
and
I
know
not
whether
it
meet
with
your
countenance
:
<EOS>
but
now
she
be
absent
for
a
little
while
,
(
for
I
know
he
would
have
follow
her
to
your
village
,
if
she
have
go
home
;
and
there
,
perhaps
,
they
would
have
ruin
one
another
,
by
marry
,
)
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
I
shall
bring
him
to
see
his
interest
,
and
that
he
engage
not
before
he
know
how
to
provide
for
a
wife
:
<EOS>
and
when
that
can
be
do
,
let
them
come
together
in
God
's
name
,
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
expect
not
to
be
answer
on
this
head
,

by
your
good
opinion
,
and
the
confidence
you
may
repose
in
my
honour
:
be

P.
S.
 
<EOS>
I
find
my
man
John
have
be
the
manager
of
the
correspondence
,
in
which
such
liberty
have
be
take
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
,
in
a
manner
that
become
me
,
let
the
saucy
fellow
know
how
much
I
resent
his
part
of
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
hard
thing
,
that
a
man
of
my
character
in
the
world
should
be
use
thus
freely
by
his
own
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
guess
at
the
poor
old
man
's
concern
,
upon
read
this
letter
from
a
gentleman
of
so
much
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
not
what
course
to
take
,
and
have
no
manner
of
doubt
of
his
poor
daughter
's
innocence
,
and
that
foul
play
be
design
her
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
sometimes
hope
the
good
,
and
be
ready
to
believe
the
surmise
correspondence
between
the
clergyman
and
her
,
have
not
receive
the
letter
she
write
,
which
would
have
clear
up
that
affair
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
he
resolve
,
as
well
to
quiet
his
own
as
her
mother
's
uneasiness
,
to
undertake
a
journey
to
the
"
squire
's
;
and
leave
his
poor
wife
to
excuse
him
to
the
farmer
who
employ
him
,
he
set
out
that
very
evening
,
late
as
it
be
;
and
travel
all
night
,
find
himself
,
soon
after
day
-
light
,
at
the
gate
of
the
gentleman
,
before
the
family
be
up
:
<EOS>
and
there
he
sit
down
to
rest
himself
till
he
should
see
somebody
stirring
.
  
<EOS>
the
groom
be
the
first
he
see
,
come
out
to
water
their
horse
;
and
he
ask
,
in
so
distressful
a
manner
,
what
be
become
of
Pamela
,
that
they
think
him
crazy
:
and
say
,
why
,
what
have
you
to
do
with
Pamela
,
old
fellow
?
 
<EOS>
get
out
of
the
horse
'
way
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
your
master
?
<EOS>
say
the
poor
man
:
<EOS>
pray
,
gentleman
,
do
not
be
angry
:
<EOS>
my
heart
's
almost
broken
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
give
any
thing
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
say
one
of
the
groom
;
so
you
lose
your
labour
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
beggar
yet
,
say
the
poor
old
man
;
I
want
nothing
of
him
,
but
my
Pamela
:
 
o
my
child
!
<EOS>
my
child
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
be
hang
,
say
one
of
them
,
if
this
be
not
Mrs.
Pamela
's
father
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
indeed
,
say
he
,
wring
his
hand
,
I
be
;
and
weeping
<EOS>
,
where
be
my
child
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
my
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
father
,
say
one
of
them
,
we
beg
your
pardon
;
but
she
be
go
home
to
you
:
how
long
have
you
be
come
from
home
?
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
but
last
night
,
say
he
;
I
have
travel
all
night
:
<EOS>
be
the
"
squire
at
home
,
or
be
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
but
he
be
not
stirring
though
,
say
the
groom
,
as
yet
.
 
<EOS>
thank
God
for
that
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
thank
God
for
that
!
<EOS>
then
I
hope
I
may
be
permit
to
speak
to
him
anon
.
 
<EOS>
They
ask
him
to
go
in
,
and
he
step
into
the
stable
,
and
sit
down
on
the
stair
there
,
wipe
his
eye
,
and
sigh
so
sadly
,
that
it
grieve
the
servant
to
hear
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
family
be
soon
raise
with
a
report
of
Pamela
's
father
come
to
inquire
after
his
daughter
;
and
the
maid
would
fain
have
have
him
go
into
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Jervis
,
have
be
tell
of
his
coming
,
arise
,
and
hasten
down
to
her
parlour
,
and
take
him
in
with
her
,
and
there
hear
all
his
sad
story
,
and
read
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
She
weep
bitterly
,
but
yet
endeavour
,
before
him
,
to
hide
her
concern
;
and
say
,
well
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
I
can
not
help
weep
at
your
grief
;
but
I
hope
there
be
no
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
let
nobody
see
this
letter
,
whatever
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
your
daughter
be
safe
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
say
he
,
I
see
you
,
madam
,
know
nothing
about
her
:
 
<EOS>
if
all
be
right
,
so
good
a
gentlewoman
as
you
be
,
would
not
have
be
a
stranger
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
you

be
with
me
!
  
<EOS>
say
she
,
My
master
do
not
always
inform
his
servant
of
his
proceeding
;
but
you
need
not
doubt
his
honour
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
his
hand
for
it
:
<EOS>
and
you
may
see
he
can
have
no
design
upon
her
,
because
he
be
not
from
hence
,
and
do
not
talk
of
go
hence
.
 
<EOS>
o
that
be
all
I
have
to
hope
for

<EOS>
why

a
strange
racket
in

have
disturb
you
so
much

I
would
have

e'en
let

what
I
do

very
safe

I
do
assure
you

you
may
take
my
honour
for
it

would
not

you
think
I
would

I
will
take
care
<EOS>
no
clergyman
shall
come
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
London
be
a
great
way
off
,
say
the
"
squire
,
and
I
can
not
send
for
her
back
presently
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
then
,
say
he
,
have
you
send
my
poor
Pamela
to
London
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
say
it
so
,
reply
the
"
squire
;
but
I
assure
you
,
upon
my
honour
,
she
be
quite
safe
and
satisfied
,
and
will
quickly
inform
you
of
it
by
letter
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
reputable
family
,
no
less
than
a
bishop
's
,
and
be
to
wait
on
his
lady
,
till
I
get
the
matter
over
that
I
mention
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
shall
I
know
this
?
<EOS>
reply
he
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
say
the
"
squire
,
pretend
anger
,
be
I
to
be
doubt
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
believe
I
can
have
any
view
upon
your
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
have
,
do
you
think
I
would
take
such
method
as
these
to
effect
it
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
surely
,
man
,
thou
forgettest
whom
thou
talk
to
.
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
he
,
I
beg
your
pardon
!
<EOS>
but
consider
my
dear
child
be
in
the
case
;
let
me
but
know
what
bishop
,
and
where
;
and
I
will
travel
to
London
on
foot
,
to
see
my
daughter
,
and
then
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
I
think
thou
hast
read
romance
as
well
as
thy
daughter
,
and
thy
head
be
turn
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
have
not
my
word
take
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
once
more
,
I
would
offer
any
thing
dishonourable
to
your
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
be
there
any
thing
look
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
man
,
recollect
a
little
who
I
be
;
and
if
I
be
not
to
be
believe
,
what
signifie
talk
?
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
say
he
,
pray
forgive
me
;
but
there
be
no
harm
to
say
,
<EOS>
what
bishop
's
,
or
whereabout
?
 
<EOS>
what
,
and
<EOS>
so
you
would
go
trouble
his
lordship
with
your
impertinent
fear
and
story
!
 
<EOS>
Will
you
be
satisfied
,
if
you
have
a
letter
from
her
within
a
week
,
it
may
be
less
,
if
she
be
not
negligent
,
to
assure
you
all
be
well
with
her
!
 
<EOS>
why
that
,
say
the
poor
man
,
will
be
some
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
say
the
gentleman
,
I
can
not
answer
for
her
negligence
,
if
she
do
not
write
:
<EOS>
and
if
she
should
send
a
letter
to
you
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
(
for
I
desire
not
to
see
it
;
I
have
have
trouble
enough
about
her
already
,
)
be
sure
you
send
it
by
a
man
and
horse
the
moment
you
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
will
,
answer
she
.
 
<EOS>
thank
your
honour
,
say
the
good
man
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
must
wait
with
as
much
patience
as
I
can
for
a
week
,
which
will
be
a
year
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
say
the
gentleman
,
it
must
be
her
own
fault
if
she
do
not
write
;
for
'
tis
what
I
insist
upon
,
for
my
own
reputation
;
and
I
shall
not
stir
from
this
house
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
till
she
be
hear
from
,
and
that
to
your
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
your
honour
,
say
the
poor
man
,
as
you
say
and
mean
truth
!
 
<EOS>
amen
,
amen
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
you
see
I
be
not
afraid
to
say
amen
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
make
the
good
man
as
welcome
as
you
can
;
and
let
me
have
no
uproar
about
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
,
whisper
her
,
bid
her
give
him
a
couple
of
guinea
to
bear
his
charge
home
;
tell
him
,
he
should
be
welcome
to
stay
there
till
the
letter
come
,
if
he
would
,
and
be
a
witness
,
that
he
intend
honourably
,
and
not
to
stir
from
his
house
for
one
while
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
old
man
staid
and
dine
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
with
some
tolerable
ease
of
mind
,
in
hope
to
hear
from
his
beloved
daughter
in
a
few
day
;
and
then
accept
the
present
,
return
for
his
own
house
,
and
resolve
to
be
as
patient
as
possible
.

Meantime
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
all
the
family
,
be
in
the
utmost
grief
for
the
trick
put
upon
the
poor
Pamela
;
and
she
and
the
steward
represent
it
to
their
master
in
as
move
term
as
they
durst
;
but
be
force
to
rest
satisfied
with
his
general
assurance
of
intend
her
no
harm
;
which
,
however
,
Mrs.
Jervis
little
believe
,
from
the
pretence
he
have
make
in
his
letter
,
of
the
correspondence
between
Pamela
and
the
young
parson
;
which
she
know
to
be
all
mere
invention
,
though
she
durst
not

so
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
week
after
,
they
be
make
a
little
more
easy

the

pretend
not

how
it
come

and
Mrs.
Jervis
send
it
away
to
the
good
old
folk

who
at
first
suspect
it
be
forge
,
and
not
their
daughter

hand
;
but
,
find
the
contrary
,
they
be
a
little
easy
to
hear
she
be
alive
and
honest
:

have
inquire
of
all
their
acquaintance
what
could

extraordinary
an

against
so
rich

resolute
a

be
afraid
to
make
matter
bad

<EOS>
though
they
see
plainly
enough
,
that
she
be
in
no
bishop
's
family
,
and
so
mistrusted
all
the
rest
of
his
story

apply
themselves
to
prayer
for
their
poor
daughter

for
an
happy
issue
to
an
affair
that
almost
distract
them

<EOS>
We
shall
now
leave
the
honest
old
pair
pray
for
their
dear
Pamela
,

return
to
the
account
she
herself
give
of

have
write

wise

to
amuse

employ
her
time

in
hope
some
opportunity
may
offer
to
send
it
to
her
friend

,
as
be
her
constant
view

that
she
may
afterwards
thankfully
look
back
upon
the
danger
she
have
escape
,
when
they
should
be
happily
overblow

as
in

she
hope
they
would
be

that
then
she
may
examine

approve

<EOS>
O
my
dearest
FATHER
and
MOTHER
!
  
<EOS>
let
me
write
,
and
bewail
my
miserable
hard
fate
,
though
I
have
no
hope
how
what
I
write
can
be
convey
to
your
hand
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
nothing
to
do
,
but
write
and
weep
,
and
fear
and
pray
!
 
<EOS>
but
yet
what
can
I
hope
for
,
when
I
seem
to
be
devote
,
as
a
victim
to
the
will
of
a
wicked
violator
of
all
the
law
of
God
and
man
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
gracious
Heaven
,
forgive
me
my
rashness
and
despondency
!
 
<EOS>
o
let
me
not
sin
against
thee
;
for
thou
good
knowest
what
be
fit
for
thy
poor
handmaid
!
 
<EOS>
and
as
thou
sufferest
not
thy
poor
creature
to
be
tempt
above
what
they
can
bear
,
I
will
resign
myself
to
thy
good
pleasure
:
<EOS>
and
still
,
I
hope
,
desperate
as
my
condition
seem
,
that
as
these
trial
be
not
of
my
own
seeking
,
nor
the
effect
of
my
presumption
and
vanity
,
I
shall
be
enable
to
overcome
them
,
and
,
in
God
's
own
good
time
,
be
deliver
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
thus
do
I
pray
imperfectly
,
as
I
be
force
by
my
distracting
fear
and
apprehension
;
and
o
join
with
me
,
my
dear
parent
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
know
,
how
can
I
reveal
to
you
,
the
dreadful
situation
of
your
poor
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
the
unhappy
Pamela
may
be
undo
(
which
God
forbid
,
and
sooner
deprive
me
of
life
!
)
<EOS>
before
you
can
know
her
hard
lot
!
  
<EOS>
o
the
unparalleled
wickedness
,
stratagem
,
and
device
,
of
those
who
call
themselves
gentleman
,
yet
pervert
the
design
of
Providence
,
in
give
them
ample
mean
to
do
good
,
to
their
own
everlasting
perdition
,
and
the
ruin
of
poor
oppress
innocence
!
  
<EOS>
but
now
I
will
tell
you
what
have
befall
me
;
and
yet
,
how
shall
you
receive
it
?
 
<EOS>
here
be
no
honest
John
to
carry
my
letter
to
you
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
I
be
watch
in
all
my
step
;
and
no
doubt
shall
be
,
till
my
hard
fate
may
ripen
his
wicked
project
for
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
every
day
,
however
,
write
my
sad
state
;
and
some
way
,
perhaps
,
may
be
open
to
send
the
melancholy
scribble
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
when
you
know
it
,
what
will
it
do
but
aggravate
your
trouble
?
 
<EOS>
for
,
o
!
<EOS>
what
can
the
abject
poor
do
against
the
mighty
rich
,
when
they
be
determined
to
oppress
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
I
must
proceed
to
write
what
I
have
hope
to
tell
you
in
a
few
hour
,
when
I
believe
I
should
receive
your
grateful
blessing
,
on
my
return
to
you
from
so
many
hardship
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
begin
with
my
account
from
the
last
letter
I
write
you
,
in
which
I
enclose
my
poor
stuff
of
verse
;
and
continue
it
at
time
,
as
I
have
opportunity
;
though
,
as
I
say
,
I
know
not
how
it
can
reach
you
.
  
<EOS>
the
long
-
hope
for
Thursday
morning
come
,
when
I
be
to
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
take
my
leave
of
my
fellow
-
servant
overnight
;
and
a
mournful
leave
<EOS>
it
be
to
us
all
:
for
man
,
as
well
as
woman
servant
,
weep
much
to
part
with
me
;
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
be
overwhelmed
with
tear
,
and
the
affect
instance
of
their
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
would
have
make
me
little
present
,
as
token
of
their
love
;
but
I
would
not
take
any
thing
from
the
low
servant
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Longman
would
have
me
accept
of
several
yard
of
Holland
,
and
a
silver
snuff
-
box
,
and
a
gold
ring
,
which
he
desire
me
to
keep
for
his
sake
;
and
he
weep
over
me
;
but
say
,
I
be
sure
so
good
a
maiden
God
will
bless
;
and
though
you
return
to
your
poor
father
again
,
and
his
low
estate
,
yet
Providence
will
find
you
out
:
<EOS>
remember
I
tell
you
so
;
and
one
day
,
though
I
may
not
live
to
see
it
,
you
will
be
reward
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
o
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
Longman
!
<EOS>
you
make
me
too
rich
,
and
too
mody
;
and
yet
I
must
be
a
beggar
before
my
time
for
I
shall
want
often
to
be
scribble
,
(
little
thinking
it
would
be
my
only
employment
so
soon
,
)
and
I
will
beg
you
,
sir
,
to
favour
me
with
some
paper
;
and
,
as
soon
as
I
get
home
,
I
will
write
you
a
letter
,
to
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
;
and
a
letter
to
good
Mrs.
Jervis
too
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
lucky
;
for
I
should
have
have
none
else
,
but
at
the
pleasure
of
my
rough
-
natured
governess
,
as
I
may
call
her
;
but
now
I
can
write
to
ease
my
mind
,
though
I
can
not
send
it
to
you
;
and
write
what
I
please
,
for
she
know
not
how
well
I
be
provide
:
for
good
Mr.
Longman
give
me
above
forty
sheet
of
paper
,
and
a
dozen
pen
,
and
a
little
phial
of
ink
;
which
last
I
wrap
in
paper
,
and
put
in
my
pocket
;
and
some
wax
and
wafer
.
  
<EOS>
o
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
you
have
set
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
how
shall
I
requite
you
?
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
by
a
kiss
,
<EOS>
my
fair
mistress
:
<EOS>
and
I
give
it
very
willingly
;
for
he
be
a
good
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
Rachel
and
Hannah
cry
sadly
,
when
I
take
my
leave
;
and
Jane
,
who
sometimes
use
to
be
a
little
crossish
,
and
cicely
too
,
weep
sadly
,
and
say
,
they
would
pray
for
me
;
but
poor
Jane
,
I
doubt
,
will
forget
that
;
for
she
seldom
say
her
prayer
for
herself
:
<EOS>
More
be
the
pity
!

then
Arthur

to
carry
me
,
be
very
civil
;
and
both
have
tear
in
their
eye
;
which
I
think
then
very
good
-
natured
in
Lincolnshire
Robin
,
because
he
know
but
little
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
since
,
I
find
he
may
well
be
concern
;
for
he
have
then
his
instruction
,
it
seem
,
and
know
how
he
be
to
be
a
means
to
entrap
me
.
  
<EOS>
then
our
other
three
footman
,
Harry
,
Isaac
,
and
Benjamin
,
and
groom
,
and
helper
,
be
very
much
affected
likewise
;
and
the
poor
little
scullion
-
boy
,
Tommy
,
be
ready
to
run
over
for
grief
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
get
all
together
over
-
night
,
expect
to
be
differently
employ
in
the
morning
;
and
they
all
beg
to
shake
hand
with
me
,
and
I
kiss
the
maiden
,
and
pray
to
God
to
bless
them
all
;
and
thank
them
for
all
their
love
and
kindness
to
me
:
and
,
indeed
,
I
be
force
to
leave
them
sooner
than
I
would
,
because
I
could
not
stand
it
:
<EOS>
indeed
I
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
(
I
could
not
have
think
it
;
for
he
be
a
little
wildish
,
they
say
)
cry
till
he
sob
again
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
poor
honest
John
,
be
not
then
come
back
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
for
the
butler
,
Mr.
Jonathan
,
he
could
not
stay
in
company
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
to
have
tell
you
a
deal
about
this
;
but
I
have
bad
thing
to
employ
my
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
cry
all
night
long
;
and
I
comfort
her
all
I
could
:
<EOS>
and
she
make
me
promise
,
that
if
my
master
go
to
London
to
attend
parliament
,
or
to
Lincolnshire
,
I
would
come
and
stay
a
week
with
her
:
and
she
would
have
give
me
money
;
but
I
would
not
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
next
morning
come
,
and
I
wonder
I
see
nothing
of
poor
honest
John
;
for
I
wait
to
take
leave
of
him
,
and
thank
him
for
all
his
civility
to
me
and
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
he
be
send
farther
by
my
master
,
and
so
could
not
return
;
and
I
desire
to
be
remember
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
Mrs.
Jervis
tell
me
,
with
a
sad
heart
,
the
chariot
be
ready
with
four
horse
to
it
<EOS>
,
I
be
just
upon
sink
into
the
ground
,
though
I
want
to
be
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
be
above
stair
,
and
never
ask
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
in
the
main
;
but
he
know
,
false
heart
as
he
be
,
that
I
be
not
to
be
out
of
his
reach
.
 
<EOS>
o
preserve
me
,
Heaven
,
from
his
power
,
and
from
his
wickedness
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
they
be
not
suffer
to
go
with
me
one
step
,
as
I
writ
to
you
before
;
for
he
stand
at
the
window
to
see
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
passage
to
the
gate
,
out
of
his
sight
,
there
they
stand
all
of
them
,
in
two
row
;
and
we
could
say
nothing
on
both
side
,
but
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
and
God
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
but
Harry
carry
my
own
bundle
,
my
third
bundle
,
as
I
be
use
to
call
it
,
to
the
coach
,
with
some
plumb
-
cake
,
and
diet
-
bread
,
<EOS>
make
for
me
over
-
night
,
and
some
sweet
-
meat
,
and
six
bottle
of
canary
wine
,
which
Mrs.
Jervis
would
make
me
take
in
a
basket
,
to
cheer
our
heart
now
and
then
,
when
we
get
together
,
as
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
kiss
all
the
maid
again
,
and
shake
hand
with
the
man
again
:
but
Mr.
Jonathan
and
Mr.
Longman
be
not
there
;
and
then
I
trip
down
the
step
to
the
chariot
,
Mrs.
Jervis
cry
most
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
up
when
I
get
to
the
chariot
,
and
I
see
my
master
at
the
window
,
in
his
gown
;
and
I
courtesie
three
time
to
him
very
low
,
and
pray
for
him
with
my
hand
lift
up
;
for
I
could
not
speak
;
indeed
I
be
not
able
:
<EOS>
and
he
bow
his
head
to
me
,
which
make
me
then
very
glad
he
would
take
such
notice
of
me
;
and
in
I
step
,
and
be
ready
to
burst
with
grief
;
and
could
only
,
till
Robin
begin
to
drive
,
wave
my
white
handkerchief
to
them
,
wet
with
my
tear
:
and
,
at
last
,
away
he
drive
,
<EOS>
Jehu
-
like
,
as
they
say
,
out
of
the
court
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
too
soon
find
I
have
cause
for
great
and
deep
grief
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
to
myself
,
at
this
rate
I
shall
soon
be
with
my
dear
father
and
mother
;
and
till
I
have
get
,
as
I
suppose
,
half
-
way
,
I
think
of
the
good
friend
I
have
leave
:
<EOS>
and
when
,
on
stop
for
a
little
bait
to
the
horse
,
Robin
tell
me
I
be
near
half
-
way
,
I
think
it
be
high
time
to
wipe
my
eye
,
and
think
to
whom
I
be
go
;
as
then
,
alack
for
me
!
<EOS>
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
begin
to
ponder
what
a
meeting
I
should
have
with
you
;
<EOS>
how
glad
you
would
both
be
to
see
me
come
safe
and
innocent
to
you
,
after
all
my
danger
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
begin
to
comfort
myself
,
and
to
banish
the
other
gloomy
side
from
my
mind
;
though
,
too
,
it
return
now
and
then
;
for
I
should
be
ungrateful
not
to
love
them
for
their
love
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
believe
I
set
out
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
and
I
wonder
and
wonder
,
when
it
be
about
two
,
as
I
see
by
a
church
dial
,
in
a
little
village
as
we
pass
through
,
that
I
be
still
more
and
more
out
of
my
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
Hey
-
day
,
think
<EOS>
I
,
to
drive
this
strange
pace
,
and
to
be
so
long
a
go
a
little
<EOS>
more
than
twenty
mile
,
be
very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
but
to
be
sure
,
think
I
,
Robin
know
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
stop
,
and
look
about
him
,
as
if
he
be
at
a
loss
for
the
road
;
and
I
say
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Robert
,
sure
you
be
out
of
the
way
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
be
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
can
not
be
much
;
I
will
ask
the
first
person
I
see
.
<EOS>
pray
do
,
say
I
;
and
he
give
his
horse
a
mouthful
of
bay
:
and
I
give
him
some
cake
,
and
two
glass
of
canary
wine
;
and
stopt
about
half
an
hour
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
drive
on
very
fast
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
so
much
to
think
of
,
of
the
danger
I
now
doubt
not
I
have
escape
,
of
the
love
friend
I
have
leave
,
and
my
good
friend
I
be
go
to
;
and
the
many
thing
I
have
to
relate
to
you
;
that
I
the
less
thought
of
the
way
,
till
I
be
startle
out
of
my
meditation
by
the
sun
begin
to
set
,
and
still
the
man
drive
on
,
and
his
horse
sweat
and
foam
;
and
then
I
begin
to
be
alarm
all
at
once
,
and
call
to
him
;
and
he
say
he
have
horrid
ill
luck
,
for
he
have
come
several
mile
out
of
the
way
,
but
be
now
right
,
and
should
get
in
still
before
it
be
quite
dark
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
begin
then
to
misgive
me
a
little
,
and
I
be
very
much
fatigued
;
for
I
have
no
sleep
for
several
night
before
,
to
signify
;
and
at
last
I
say
,
Pray
Mr.
Robert
,
there
be
a
town
before
us
<EOS>
,
what
do
you
call
it
?
 
<EOS>
if
we
be
so
much
out
of
the
way
,
we
have
better
put
up
there
,
for
the
night
come
on
apace
:
<EOS>
and
,
Lord
protect
me
!
<EOS>
think
I
,
I
shall
have
new
danger
,
mayhap
,
to
encounter
with
the
man
,
who
have
escape
the
master
 
little
thinking
of
the
base
contrivance
of
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
I
be
just
there
:
'
<EOS>
Tis
but
a
mile
on
one
side
of
the
town
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
say
I
,
I
may
be
mistake
;
for
it
be
a
good
while
since
I
be
this
way
;
but
I
be
sure
the
face
of
the
country
here
be
nothing
like
what
I
remember
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
pretend
to
be
much
out
of
humour
with
himself
for
mistake
the
way
,
and
at
last
stop
at
a
farmhouse
,
about
two
mile
beyond
the
village
I
have
see
;
and
it
be
then
almost
dark
,
and
he
alight
,
and
say
,
We
must
make
shift
here
;
for
I
be
quite
out
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
,
think
I
,
be
good
to
the
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
More
trial
still
!
 
<EOS>
what
will
befall
me
next
?
  
<EOS>
the
farmer
's
wife
,
and
maid
,
and
daughter
,
come
out
;
and
the
wife
say
,
what
bring
you
this
way
at
this
time
of
night
,
Mr.
Robert
?
 
<EOS>
and
with
a
lady
too
?
 
<EOS>
then
I
begin
to
be
frighten
out
of
my
wit
;
and
lay
middle
and
both
end
together
,
I
fall
a
crying
,
and
say
,
God
give
me
patience
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
undo
for
certain
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
mistress
,
say
I
,
do
you
know
"
Squire
B
#
#
#
#
,
of
Bedfordshire
?
  
<EOS>
the
wicked
coachman
would
have
prevent
the
answer
me
;
but
the
simple
daughter
say
,
know
his
worship
!
<EOS>
yes
,
surely
!
<EOS>
why

be
my
father
's
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
then
I
be
undone
;
undone
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
o
,
wicked
wretch
!
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
to
you
,
say
I
to
the
coachman
,
to
serve
me
thus
?
 
<EOS>
vile
tool
of
a
wicked
master
!
 
<EOS>
Faith
,
say
the
fellow
,
I
be
sorry
this
task
be
put
upon
me
;
but
I
could
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
make
the
good
of
it
now
;
here
be
very
civil
reputable
folk
;
and
you
will
be
safe
here
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
get
out
,
say
I
,
and
I
will
walk
back
to
the
town
we
come
through
,
late
as
it
be
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
will
not
enter
here
.
  
<EOS>
say
the
farmer
's
wife
,
You
will
be
very
well
use
here
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
,
young
gentlewoman
,
and
have
well
convenience
than
any
where
in
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
I
matter
not
convenience
,
say
I
:
<EOS>
I
be
betray
and
undone
!
<EOS>
as
you
have
a
daughter
of
your
own
,
pity
me
,
and
let
me
know
if
your
landlord
,
as
you
call
him
,
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
will
assure
you
he
be
not
,
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
come
the
farmer
,
a
good
-
like
sort
of
man
,
grave
,
and
well
-
behave
;
and
speak
to
me
in
such
sort
,
as
make
me
a
little
pacified
;
and
see
no
help
for
it
<EOS>
,
I
go
in
;
and
the
wife
immediately
conduct
me
up
stair
to
the
good
apartment
,
and
tell
me
,
that
be
mine
as
long
as
I
staid
:
<EOS>
and
nobody
should
come
near
me
<EOS>
but
when
I
call
.
 
<EOS>
I
throw
myself
on
the
bed
in
the
room
,
tired
and
frighten
to
death
almost
;
and
give
way
to
the
most
excessive
fit
of
grief
that
I
ever
have
.
  
<EOS>
the
daughter
come
up
,
and
say
,
Mr.
Robert
have
give
her
a
letter
to
give
me
;
and
there
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
raise
myself
,
and
see
it
be
the
hand
and
seal
of
the
wicked
wretch
,
my
master
,
direct
to
Mrs.
Pamela
Andrews
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
little
well
than
to
have
him
here
;
though
,
if
he
have
,
he
must
have
be
bring
through
the
air
;
for
I
think
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
woman
(
for
I
begin
to
see
thing
about
a
little
reputable
,
and
no
guile
appear
in
them
,
but
rather
a
face
of
grief
for
my
grief
)
offer
me
a
glass
of
some
cordial
water
,
which
I
accept
,
for
I
be
ready
to
sink
;
and
then
I
sit
up
in
a
chair
<EOS>
a
little
,
though
very
faintish
:
and
they
bring
me
two
candle
,
and
light
a
brushwood
fire
;
and
say
,
if
I
call
,
I
should
be
wait
on
instantly
;
and
so
leave
me
to
ruminate
on
my
sad
condition
,
and
to
read
my
letter
,
which
I
be
not
able
to
do
presently
.
 
<EOS>
after
I
have
a
little
come
to
myself
<EOS>
,
I
find
it
to
contain
these
word
:
  
"
dear
pamela
,
  
"
<EOS>
the
passion
I
have
for
you
,
and
your
obstinacy
,
have
constrain
me
to
act
by
you
in
a
manner
that
I
know
will
occasion
you
great
trouble
and
fatigue
,
both
of
mind
and
body
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
forgive
me
,
my
dear
girl
;
for
,
although
I
have
take
this
step
,
I
will
,
by
all
that
be
good
and
holy
!
<EOS>
use
you
honourably
.
 
<EOS>
suffer
not
your
fear
to
transport
you
to
a
behaviour
that
will
be
disreputable
to
us
both
:
for
the
place
where
you
will
receive
this
,
be
a
farm
that
belong
to
me
;
and
the
people
civil
,
honest
,
and
obliging
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
,
by
this
time
,
be
far
on
your
way
to
the
place
I
have
allot
for
your
abode
for
a
few
week
,
till
I
have
manage
some
affair
,
that
will
make
me
shew
myself
to
you
in
a
much
different
light
,
than
you
may
possibly
apprehend
from
this
rash
action
:
and
to
convince
you
,
that
I
mean
no
harm
,
I

much

that

do
not

hardly
of

You

that
I
find

have
rather
serve

undertake
this

to
assure

of

honourable
intention
to

which
I

you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
but
too
well
apprehend
that
the
letter
be
only
to
pacify
me
for
the
present
;
but
as
my
danger
be
not
so
immediate
as
I
have
reason
to
dread
,
and
he
have
promise
to
forbear
come
to
me
,
and
to
write
to
you
,
my
dear
parent
,
to
quiet
your
concern
,
I
be
a
little
more
easy
than
before
<EOS>
and
I
make
shift
to
eat
a
little
bit
of
boil
chicken
they
have
get
for
me
,
and
drank
a
glass
of
my
sack
,
and
make
each
of
them
do
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
I
have
so
do
,
I
be
again
a
little
flustered
;
for
in
come
the
coachman
with
the
look
of
a
hangman
,
I
think
,
and
madame
me
up
strangely
;
tell
me
,
he
would
beg
me
to
get
ready
to
pursue
my
journey
by
five
in
the
morning
,
or
else
he
should
be
late
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
grieve
at
this
;
for
I
begin
not
to
dislike
my
company
,
consider
how
thing
stand
;
and
be
in
hope
to
get
a
party
among
them
,
and
so
to
put
myself
into
any
worthy
protection
in
the
neighbourhood
,
rather
than
go
forward
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
withdraw
,
I
begin
to
tamper
with
the
farmer
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
they
have
have
a
letter
deliver
them
at
the
same
time
I
have
;
so
securely
have
Lucifer
put
it
into
his
head
to
do
his
work
;
and
they
only
shake
their
head
,
and
seem
to
pity
me
;
and
so
I
be
force
to
give
over
that
hope
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
good
farmer
shew
me
his
letter
;
which
I
copy
as
follow
:
for
it
discover
the
deep
art
of
this
wicked
master
;
and
how
resolve
he
seem
to
be
on
my
ruin
,
by
the
pain
he
take
to
deprive
me
of
all
hope
of
free
myself
from
his
power

"
FARMER
NORTON
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
send
to
your
house
,
for
one
night
only
,
a
young
gentlewoman
,
much
against
her
will
,
who
have
deeply
embark
in
a
love
affair
,
which
will
be
her
ruin
,
as
well
as
the
person
be
to
whom
she
want
to
betroth
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
to
oblige
her
father
,
order
her
to
be
carry
to
one
of
my
house
,
where
she
will
be
well
use
,
to
try
,
if
by
absence
,
and
expostulation
with
both
,
they
can
be
bring
to
know
their
own
interest
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
you
will
use
her
kindly
for
my
sake
:
for
,
except
this
matter
,
which
she
will
not
own
,
she
do
not
want
prudence
and
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
acknowledge
any
trouble
you
shall
be
at
in
this
matter
the
first
opportunity
;
and
be
                              
"
Your
friend
and
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
say
,
too
cunningly
for
me
,
that
I
would
not
own
this
pretended
love
affair
;
so
that
he
have
provide
them
not
to
believe
me
,
say
what
I
would
;
and
as
they
be
his
tenant
,
who
all
love
him
,
(
for
he
have
some
amiable
quality
,
and
so
he
have
need
!
)
<EOS>
I
see
all
my
plot
cut
out
,
and
so
be
force
to
say
the
less
.
  
<EOS>
I
weep
bitterly
,
however
;
for
I
find
he
be
too
hard
for
me
,
as
well
in
his
contrivance
as
rich
;
and
so
have
recourse
again
to
my
only
refuge
,
comfort
myself
,
that
God
never
fail
to
take
the
innocent
heart
into
his
protection
,
and
be
alone
able
to
baffle
and
confound
the
device
of
the
mighty
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
farmer
be
so
prepossess
with
the
content
of
his
letter
,
that
he
begin
to
praise
his
care
and
concern
for
me
,
and
to
advise
me
against
entertaining
address
without
my
friend
'
advice
and
consent
;
and
make
me
the
subject
of
a
lesson
for
his
daughter
's
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
glad
to
shut
up
this
discourse
;
for
I
see
I
be
not
likely
to
be
believe
.
  
<EOS>
I
send
,
however
,
to
tell
my
driver
,
that
I
be
so
fatigued
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
get
out
<EOS>
so
soon
the
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
insist
upon
it
,
and
say
,
It
would
make
my
day
's
journey
the
light
;
and
I
find
he
be
a
more
faithful
servant
to
his
master
,
notwithstanding
what
he
write
of
his
reluctance
,
than
I
could
have
wish
<EOS>
:
I
see
still
more
and
more
,
that
all
be
deep
dissimulation
,
and
contrivance
bad
and
bad
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
I
may
have
shew
them
his
letter
to
me
,
as
a
full
confutation
of
his
to
them
;
but
I
see
no
probability
of
engage
them
in
my
behalf
:
and
so
think
it
signify
little
,
as
I
be
to
go
away
so
soon
,
to
enter
more
particularly
into
the
matter
with
them
;
and
besides
,
I
see
they
be
not
inclinable
to
let
me
stay
longer
,
for
fear
of
disoblige
him
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
bed
,
but
have
very
little
rest
:
and
they
would
make
their
servant
-
maid
bear
me
company
in
the
chariot
five
mile
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
she
be
to
walk
hack
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
contrive
in
my
thought
,
when
I
be
on
my
way
in
the
chariot
,
on
Friday
morning
,
that
when
we
come
into
some
town
to
bait
,
as
he
must
do
for
the
horse
'
sake
,
I
would
,
at
the
inn
,
apply
myself
,
if
I
see
I
any
way
<EOS>
could
,
to
the
mistress
of
the
inn
,
and
tell
her
the
case
,
and
to
refuse
to
go
farther
,
have
nobody
but
this
wicked
coachman
to
contend
with
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
very
full
of
this
project
,
and
in
great
hope
,
some
how
or
other
,
to
extricate
myself
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
!
<EOS>
the
artful
wretch
have
provide
for
even
this
last
refuge
of
mine
;
for
when
we
come
to
put
up
at
a
large
town
on
the
way
,
to
eat
a
morsel
for
dinner
,
and
I
be
fully
resolve
to
execute
my
project
,
who
should
be
at
the
inn
that
he
put
up
at
,
but
the
wicked
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
expect
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
her
sister
-
in
-
law
be
the
mistress
of
it
;
and
she
have
provide
a
little
entertainment
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
I
find
,
when
I
desire
,
as
soon
as
I
come
in
,
to
speak
with
the
mistress
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
to
me
:
and
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
a
poor
unhappy
young
body
<EOS>
,
that
want
your
advice
and
assistance
;
and
you
seem
to
be
a
good
sort
of
a
gentlewoman
,
that
would
assist
an
oppress
innocent
person
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
madam
,
say
she
,
I
hope
you
guess
right
;
and
I
have
the
happiness
to
know
something
of
the
matter
before
you
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
call
my
sister
jewke
.
 
<EOS>
jewke
!
<EOS>
jewke
!
<EOS>
think
I
<EOS>
;
I
have
hear
of
that
name
;
I
do
not
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
wicked
creature
appear
,
whom
I
have
never
see
but
once
before
,
and
I
be
terrify
out
of
my
wit
.
 
<EOS>
no
stratagem
,
think
I
,
not
one
!
<EOS>
for
a
poor
innocent
girl
;
but
every
thing
to
turn
out
against
me
;
that
be
hard
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
so
I
begin
to
pull
in
my
horn
,
as
they
say
,
for
I
see
I
be
now
bad
off
than
at
the
farmer
's
.
  
<EOS>
the
naughty
woman
come
up
to
me
with
an
air
of
confidence
,
and
kiss
me
:
see
,
sister
,
<EOS>
say
she
,
here
be
a
charming
creature
!
 
<EOS>
Would
she
not
tempt
the
good
lord
in
the
land
to
run
away
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
o
frightful
!
<EOS>
think
I
<EOS>
;
here
be
an
avowal
of
the
matter
at
once
:
I
be
now
go
<EOS>
,
that
be
certain
.
<EOS>
and
so
be
quite
silent
and
confound
;
and
see
no
help
for
it
,
(
for
she
would
not
part
with
me
out
of
her
sight
)
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
set
out
with
her
in
the
chariot
for
she
come
thither
on
horseback
,
with
a
man
-
servant
,
who
ride
by
us
the
rest
of
the
way
,
lead
her
horse
:
and
now
I
give
over
all
thought
of
redemption
,
and
be
in
a
desponding
condition
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
think
I
,
here
be
strange
pain
take
to
ruin
a
poor
innocent
,
helpless
,
and
even
worthless
young
body
.
 
<EOS>
this
plot
be
lay
too
deep
,
and
have
be
too
long
hatching
,
to
be
baffle
,
I
fear
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
I
put
my
trust
in
God
,
who
I
know
be
able
to
do
every
thing
for
me
,
when
all
other
possible
mean
should
fail
:
<EOS>
and
in
him
I
be
resolve
to
confide
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
see
(
<EOS>
yet
,
oh
!
<EOS>
that
kill
me
;
for
I
know
not
whether
ever
you
can
see
what
I
now
write
or
<EOS>
no
 
else
you
will
see
)
 
<EOS>
what
sort
of
woman
that
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
,
compare
to
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
by
this
:
#
#
#
#
  
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
she
would
be
stare
in
my
face
,
in
the
chariot
,
and
squeeze
my
hand
,
and
say
,
why
,
you
be
very
pretty
,
my
silent
dear
!
<EOS>
and
once
she
offer
to
kiss
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
I
do
not
like
this
sort
of
carriage
,
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
it
be
not
like
two
person
of
one
sex
.
 
<EOS>
She
fall
a
laughing
very
confidently
,
and
say
,
that
be
prettily
say
,
I
vow
!
 
<EOS>
then
thou
hadst
rather
be
kiss
by
the
other
sex
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
fackin
,
I
commend
thee
for
that
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
sadly
tease
with
her
impertinence
,
and
bold
way
;
but
no
wonder
;
she
be
innkeeper
's
housekeeper
,
before
she
come
to
my
master
;
and
those
sort
of
creature
do
not
want
confidence
,
you
know
:
<EOS>
and
indeed
she
make
nothing
to
talk
boldly
on
twenty
occasion
;
and
say
two
or
three
time
,
when
she
see
the
tear
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
we
rid
,
trickle
down
my
cheek
,
I
be
sorely
hurt
,
truly
,
to
have
the
handsome
and
fine
young
gentleman
in
five
county
in
love
with
me
!
  
<EOS>
so
I
find
I
be
get
into
the
hand
of
a
wicked
procuress
;
and
if
I
be
not
safe
with
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
where
every
body
love
me
,
what
a
dreadful
prospect
have
I
now
before
me
,
in
the
hand
of
a
woman
that
seem
to
delight
in
filthiness
!
  
<EOS>
o
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
surely
,
I
shall
never
be
equal
to
all
these
thing
!
  
<EOS>
about
eight
at
night
,
we
enter
the
court
-
yard
of
this
handsome
,
large
,
old
,
and
lonely
mansion
,
that
look
make
for
solitude
and
mischief
,
as
I
think
,
by
its
appearance
,
with
all
its
brown
nodding
horror
of
lofty
elm
and
pine
about
it
:
and
here
,
say
I
to
myself
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
be
to
be
the
scene
of
my
ruin
,
unless
God
protect
me
,
who
be
all
-
sufficient
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
sick
at
enter
it
,
partly
from
fatigue
,
and
partly
from
dejection
of
spirit
:
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
get
me
some
mulled
wine
,
and
seem
mighty
officious
to
welcome
me
thither
;
and
while
she
be
absent
,
order
the
wine
,
the
wicked
Robin
come
in
to
me
,
and
say
,
I
beg
a
thousand
pardon
for
my
part
in
this
affair
,
since
I
see
your
grief
and
your
distress
;
and
I
do
assure
you
,
that
I
be
sorry
it
fall
to
my
task
.
  
<EOS>
mighty
well
,
Mr.
Robert
!
say
I
;
<EOS>
I
never
see
an
execution
but
once
,
and
then
the
hangman
ask
the
poor
creature
's
pardon
,
and
wipe
his
mouth
,
as
you
do
,
and
plead
his
duty
,
and
then
calmly
tuck
up
the
criminal
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
no
criminal
,
as
you
all
know
:
<EOS>
and
if
I
could
have
think
it
my
duty
to
obey
a
wicked
master
in
his
unlawful
command
,
I
have
save
you
all
the
merit
of
this
vile
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
,
say
he
,
you
take
it
so
:
but
every
body
do
not
think
alike
.
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
you
have
do
your
part
,
Mr.
Robert
,
towards
my
ruin
,
very
faithfully
;
and
will
have
cause
to
be
sorry
<EOS>
,
may
be
,
at
the
long
run
,
when
you
shall
see
the
mischief
that
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Your
eye
be
open
,
and
you
know
I
be
to
be
carry
to
my
father
's
,
and
that
I
be
barbarously
trick
and
betray
;
and
I
can
only
,
once
more
,
thank
you
for
your
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
you
!
  
<EOS>
so
he
go
away
a
little
sad
.
 
<EOS>
what
have
you
say
to
Robin
,
madam
?
<EOS>
say
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
(
who
come
in
as
he
go
out
:
)
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
's
ready
to
cry
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
be
afraid
of
your
follow
his
example
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
:
I
have
be
tell
him
,
that
he
have
do
his
part
to
my
ruin
:
and
he
now
can
not
help
it
!
 
<EOS>
so
his
repentance
do
me
<EOS>
no
good
<EOS>
;
I
wish
it
may
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
assure
you
,
madam
,
say
she
,
I
should
be
as
ready
to
cry
as
he
,
if
I
should
do
you
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
his
power
to
help
it
now
,
say
I
;
but
your
part
be
to
come
,
and
you
may
choose
whether
you
will
contribute
to
my
ruin
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
look
ye
,
madam
,
say
she
,
I
have
a
great
notion
of
do
my
duty
to
my
master
;
and
therefore
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
if
I
can
do
that
,
and
serve
you
,
<EOS>
I
will
:
<EOS>
but
you
must
think
,
if
your
desire
,
and
his
will
,
come
to
clash
once
,
I
shall
do
as
he
bid
me
,
<EOS>
let
it
be
what
it
will
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
do
not
madam
me
so
:
<EOS>
I
be
but
a
silly
poor
girl
,
set
up
by
the
gambol
of
fortune
,
for
a
May
-
game
;
and
now
be
to
be
something
,
and
now
nothing
,
just
as
that
think
fit
to
sport
with
me
:
<EOS>
and
let
you
and
me
talk
upon
a
foot
together
;
for
I
be
a
servant
inferior
to
you
,
and
so
much
the
more
,
as
I
be
turn
out
of
place
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
say
she
,
I
understand
something
of
the
matter
;
you
have
so
great
power
over
my
master
,
that
you
may
soon
be
mistress
of
us
all
;
and
so
I
would
oblige
you
,
if
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
and
will
call
you
madam
;
for
I
be
instruct
to
shew
you
all
respect
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
who
instruct
you
so
to
do
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
who
!
<EOS>
my
master
,
to
be
sure
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
how
can
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
see
him
lately
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
that
be
true
,
say
she
;
but
I
have
be
expect
you
here
some
time
;
(
o
the
deep
lay
wickedness
!
<EOS>
think
I
:
)
and
,
besides
,
I
have
a
letter
of
instruction
by
Robin
;
but
,
may
be
,
I
should
not
have
say
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
shew
them
to
me
,
say
I
,
I
should
be
able
to
judge
how
far
I
could
,
or
could
not
,
expect
favour
from
you
,
consistent
with
your
duty
to
our
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
fair
mistress
,
for
that
,
say
she
,
I
be
sufficiently
instruct
;
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
I
will
observe
my
order
;
and
,
so
far
as
they
will
let
me
,
so
far
will
I
oblige
you
;
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
you
will
not
,
I
hope
,
do
an
unlawful
or
wicked
thing
,
for
any
master
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
look
ye
<EOS>
,
say
she
,
he
be
my
master
;
and
if
he
bid
me
do
any
thing
that
I
can
do
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
ought
to
do
it
;
and
let
him
,
who
have
his
power
to
command
me
,
look
to
the
lawfulness
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
suppose
he
should
bid
you
cut
my
throat
,
Would
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
danger
of
that
,
say
she
;
but
to
be
sure
I
would
not
;
for
then
I
should
be
hang
!
<EOS>
for
that
would
be
murder
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
and
suppose
he
should
resolve
to
ensnare
a
poor
young
creature
,
and
ruin
her
,
would
you
assist
him
in
that
?
 
<EOS>
for
to
rob
a
person
of
her
virtue
be
bad
than
cut
her
throat
.
  
<EOS>
why
now
,
say
she
,
how
strangely
you
talk
!
 
<EOS>
be
not
the
two
sex
make
for
one
another
?
 
<EOS>
and
be
it
not
natural
for
a
gentleman
to
love
a
pretty
woman
?
 
<EOS>
and
suppose
he
can
obtain
his
desire
,
be
that
so
bad
as
cut
her
throat
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
wretch
fall
a
laughing
,
and
talk
most
impertinently
,
and
shew
me
,
that
I
have
nothing
to
expect
from
her
virtue
or
conscience
:
and
this
give
me
great
mortification
;
for
I
be
in
hope
of
work
upon
her
by
degree
.
  
<EOS>
so
we
end
our
discourse
here
,
and
I
bid
her
shew
me
where
I
must
lie
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
lie
where
you
list
,
<EOS>
madam
<EOS>
;
I
can
tell
you
,
I
must
lie
with
you
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
present
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
and
torture
then
wring
my
heart
!
 
<EOS>
but
be
it
in
your
instruction
,
that
you
must
lie
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
indeed
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
say
I.
 
why
,
say
she
,
I
be
wholesome
,
and
cleanly
too
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
that
;
but
I
love
to
lie
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
how
so
?
<EOS>
say
she
;
<EOS>
be
not
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
your
bed
-
fellow
at
t'other
house
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
quite
sick
of
her
,
and
my
condition
;
you
must
do
as
you
be
instruct
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
myself
,
and
be
a
most
miserable
creature
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeat
her
insufferable
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
mighty
miserable
,
indeed
,
to
be
so
well
beloved
by
one
of
the
fine
gentleman
in
England
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
come
down
in
my
writing
to
this
present
SATURDAY
,
and
a
deal
I
have
write
.
  
<EOS>
My
wicked
bed
-
fellow
have
very
punctual
order
,
it
seem
;
for
she
lock
me
and
herself
in
,
and
tie
the
two
key
<EOS>
(
for
there
be
a
double
door
to
the
room
)
about
her
wrist
,
when
she
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
She
talk
of
the
house
have
be
attempt
to
be
break
open
two
or
three
time
;
whether
to
fright
me
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
it
make
me
fearful
;
though
not
so
much
as
I
should
be
,
if
I
have
not
other
and
great
fear
.
  
<EOS>
I
sleep
but
<EOS>
little
last
night
,
and
get
up
,
and
pretend
to
sit
by
the
window
,
which
look
into
the
spacious
garden
;
but
I
be
write
all
the
time
,
from
break
of
day
,
to
her
get
up
,
and
after
,
when
she
be
absent
.
  
<EOS>
at
breakfast
she
present
the
two
maid
to
me
,
the
cook
and
house
-
maid
,
poor
awkward
soul
,
that
I
can
see
no
hope
of
,
they
seem
so
devoted
to
her
and
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
be
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
find
some
way
to
escape
,
before
this
wicked
master
come
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
besides
,
of
servant
,
the
coachman
,
Robert
,
a
groom
,
a
helper
,
a
footman
;
all
but
Robert
,
(
and
he
be
accessary
to
my
ruin
,
)
<EOS>
strange
creature
,
that
promise
nothing
;
and
all
likewise
devoted
to
this
woman
.
<EOS>
the
gardener
look
like
a
good
honest
man
;
but
he
be
keep
at
a
distance
,
and
seem
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
I
see
not
Mr.
Williams
the
clergyman
,
but
would
not
ask
after
him
,
apprehend
it
may
give
some
jealousy
;
but
when
I
have
behold
the
rest
,
he
be
the
only
one
I
have
hope
of
;
for
I
think
his
cloth
would
set
him
above
assist
in
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
afternoon
he
come
;
<EOS>
for
it
seem
he
have
a
little
latin
school
in
the
neighbouring
village
,
which
he
attend
;
and
this
bring
him
in
a
little
matter
,
additional
to
my
master
's
favour
,
till
something
well
fall
,
of
which
he
have
hope
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
sensible
sober
young
gentleman
;
and
when
I
see
him
I
confirm
myself
in
my
hope
of
him
;
for
he
seem
to
take
great
notice
of
my
distress
and
grief
;
(
for
I
could
not
hide
it
;
)
though
he
appear
fearful
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
who
watch
all
our
motion
and
word
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
an
apartment
in
the
house
;
but
be
mostly
at
a
lodging
in
the
town
,
for
a
conveniency
of
his
little
school
;
only
on
Saturday
afternoon
and
Sundays
:
and
he
preach
sometimes
for
the
minister
of
the
village
,
which
be
about
three
mile
off
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
to
go
to
church
with
him
to
-
morrow
:
<EOS>
sure
it
be
not
in
her
instruction
to
deny
me
!
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
have
think
of
every
thing
!
 
<EOS>
and
something
may
strike
out
for
me
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
ask
her
,
for
a
feint
,
(
because
she
shall
not
think
I
be
so
well
provide
,
)
to
indulge
me
with
pen
and
ink
,
though
I
have
be
use
my
own
so
freely
when
her
absence
would
let
me
;
for
I
beg
to
be
leave
to
myself
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
she
will
let
me
have
it
;
but
then
I
must
promise
not
to
send
any
writing
out
of
the
house
,
without
her
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
it
be
only
to
divert
my
grief
when
I
be
by
myself
,
as
I
desire
to
be
;
for
I
love
write
as
well
as
read
;
<EOS>
but
I
have
nobody
to
send
to
<EOS>
,
she
know
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
no
,
not
at
present
,
may
be
,
say
she
;
but
I
be
tell
you
be
a
great
writer
;
and
it
be
in
my
instruction
to
see
all
you
write
:
<EOS>
so
,
look
you
here
,
say
she
,
I
will
let
you
have
a
pen
and
ink
,
and
two
sheet
of
paper
:
for
this
employment
will
keep
you
out
of
bad
thought
:
but
I
must
see
them
always
when
I
ask
,
write
or
not
write
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
very
hard
,
say
I
;
but
may
I
not
have
to
myself
the
closet
in
the
room
where
we
lie
,
with
the
key
to
lock
up
my
thing
?
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
may
consent
to
that
,
say
she
;
and
I
will
set
it
in
order
for
you
,
and
leave
the
key
in
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
spinnet
too
,
say
she
;
if
it
be
in
tune
,
you
may
play
to
divert
you
now
and
then
;
for
I
know
my
old
lady
learn
you
:
<EOS>
and
below
be
my
master
's
library
<EOS>
:
you
may
take
out
what
book
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
these
and
my
writing
will
be
all
my
amusement
<EOS>
:
for
I
have
no
work
give
me
to
do
;
and
the
spinnet
,
if
in
tune
,
will
not
find
my
mind
,
I
be
sure
,
in
tune
to
play
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
go
directly
and
pick
out
some
book
from
the
library
,
with
which
I
fill
a
shelf
in
the
closet
<EOS>
she
give
me
possession
of
;
and
from
these
I
hope
to
receive
improvement
,
as
well
as
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
be
her
back
turn
,
than
I
set
about
hide
a
pen
of
my
own
here
,
and
another
there
,
<EOS>
for
fear
I
should
come
to
be
deny
,
and
a
little
of
my
ink
in
a
break
China
cup
,
and
a
little
in
another
cup
;
and
a
sheet
of
paper
here
and
there
among
my
linen
,
with
a
little
of
the
wax
,
and
a
few
wafer
,
in
several
place
,
lest
I
should
be
search
;
and
something
,
I
think
,
may
happen
to
open
a
way
for
my
deliverance
,
by
these
or
some
other
mean
.
 
<EOS>
o
the
pride
,
think
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
,
I
shall
have
,
if
I
can
secure
my
innocence
,
and
escape
the
artful
wile
of
this
wicked
master
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
if
he
come
hither
,
I
be
undo
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
for
this
naughty
woman
will
assist
him
,
rather
than
fail
,
in
the
bad
of
his
attempt
;
and
he
will
have
no
occasion
to
send
her
out
of
the
way
,
as
he
would
have
do
Mrs.
Jervis
once
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
must
set
all
my
little
wit
at
work
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
grief
to
me
to
write
,
and
not
to
be
able
to
send
to
you
what
I
write
:
<EOS>
but
now
it
be
all
the
diversion
I
have
,
and
if
God
will
favour
my
escape
with
my
innocence
,
as
I
trust
he
graciously
will
,
for
all
these
black
prospect
,
with
what
pleasure
shall
I
read
them
afterwards
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
say
,
pray
for
your
dutiful
daughter
,
as
I
use
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
know
my
distress
,
though
I
be
sure
I
have
your
prayer
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
write
on
as
thing
happen
,
that
if
a
way
should
open
,
my
scribble
may
be
ready
to
be
send
<EOS>
:
for
what
I
do
,
must
be
at
a
jerk
,
to
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
I
want
such
an
oblige
honest
-
hearted
man
as
John
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
come
to
SUNDAY
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
here
be
a
sad
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
deny
by
this
barbarous
woman
to
go
to
church
,
as
I
have
build
upon
I
<EOS>
may
:
<EOS>
and
she
have
huff
poor
Mr.
Williams
all
to
piece
,
for
plead
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
he
be
to
be
forbid
the
house
,
if
she
please
.
 
<EOS>
poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
all
his
dependance
be
upon
my
master
,
who
have
a
very
good
live
for
him
,
if
the
incumbent
die
;
and
he
have
keep
his
bed
these
four
month
,
of
old
age
and
dropsy
.
  
<EOS>
He
pay
me
great
respect
,
and
I
see
pity
me
;
and
would
,
perhaps
,
assist
my
escape
from
these
danger
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
nobody
to
plead
for
me
;
and
why
should
I
wish
to
ruin
a
poor
gentleman
,
by
engage
him
against
his
interest
?
 
<EOS>
yet
one
would
do
any
thing
to
preserve
one
's
innocence
;
and
Providence
would
,
perhaps
,
make
it
up
to
him
!
  
<EOS>
o
judge
<EOS>
(
but
how
shall
you
see
what
I
write
!
)
<EOS>
of
my
distracted
condition
,
to
be
reduce
to
such
a
pass
as
to
a
desire
to
lay
trap
for
mankind
!
<EOS>
but
he
want
sadly
to
say
something
to
me
,
as
he
whisperingly
hint
.
  
<EOS>
the
wretch
(
I
think
I
will
always
call
her
the
wretch
henceforth
)
abuse
me
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
but
talk
to
one
of
the
maid
just
now
,
indeed
a
little
to
tamper
with
her
by
degree
:
<EOS>
and
she
popt
upon
us
,
and
say
 
Nay
,
madam
,
do
not
offer
to
tempt
poor
innocent
country
maiden
from
do
their
duty
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
<EOS>
,
I
hear
,
she
should
take
a
walk
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
charge
you
,
Nan
,
never
stir
with
her
,
nor
obey
her
,
without
let
me
know
it
,
in
the
small
trifle
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
walk
with
you
!
<EOS>
and
where
would
you
go
,
I
tro
'
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
barbarous
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
only
to
look
a
little
up
the
elm
-
walk
,
since
you
would
not
let
me
go
to
church
.
  
<EOS>
Nan
,
say
she
,
to
shew
me
how
much
they
be
all
in
her
power
,
pull
off
madam
's
shoe
,
and
bring
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
take
care
of
her
other
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
she
shall
not
,
say
I.
 
Nay
,
say
Nan
,
but
I
must
if
my
mistress
bid
me
:
so
pray
,
madam
,
do
not
hinder
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
indeed
(
would
you
believe
it
?
)
<EOS>
she
take
my
shoe
off
,
and
leave
me
barefoot
:
and
,
for
my
share
,
I
have
be
so
fright
at
this
,
that
I
have
not
power
even
to
relieve
my
mind
by
my
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
stupefy
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
here
I
be
force
to
leave
off
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
will
give
you
a
picture
of
this
wretch
:
She
be
a
broad
,
squat
,
pursy
,
fat
thing
,
quite
ugly
,
if
any
thing
human
can
be
so
call
;
about
forty
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
huge
hand
,
and
an
arm
as
thick
as
my
waist
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nose
be
flat
and
crooked
,
and
her
brow
grow
down
over
her
eye
;
a
dead
spiteful
,
grey
,
goggle
eye
,
to
be
sure
she
have
.
 
<EOS>
and
her
face
be
flat
and
broad
;
and
as
to
colour
,
look
like
as
if
it
have
be
pickle
a
month
in
saltpetre
:
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
drink
:
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
hoarse
,
man
-
like
voice
,
and
be
as
thick
as
she
be
long
;
and
yet
look
so
deadly
strong
,
that
I
be
afraid
she
would
dash
me
at
her
foot
in
an
instant
,
if
I
be
to
vex
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
with
a
heart
more
ugly
than
her
face
,
she
frighten
me
sadly
:
and
I
be
undone
to
be
sure
,
if
God
do
not
protect
me
;
for
she
be
very
,
very
wicked
 
<EOS>
indeed
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
poor
helpless
spite
in
me
:
 
<EOS>
but
the
picture
be
too
near
the
truth
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
She
send
me
a
message
just
now
,
that
I
shall
have
my
shoe
again
,
if
I
will
accept
of
her
company
to
walk
with
me
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
to
waddle
with
me
,
rather
,
think
I.
  
<EOS>
well
,
'
tis
not
my
business
to
quarrel
with
her
downright
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
watch
the
narrower
,
if
I
do
;
and
so
I
will
go
with
the
hate
wretch
.
 
<EOS>
o
for
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
!
<EOS>
or
,
rather
,
to
be
safe
with
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
out
of
my
wit
for
joy
!
 
<EOS>
just
as
I
have
get
my
shoe
on
,
I
be
tell
John
,
honest

,

on
horseback
!
 
<EOS>

blessing
on
his
faithful
heart
!
 
<EOS>
what
joy
be
this
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
more
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
let
her
know
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
to
see
this
dear
bless
John
,
to
be
sure
!
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
but

sad
,
as
I
see
him
out
of
the
window
!
 
<EOS>
what
can
be
the
matter
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
my
dear
parent
be
well
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Mr.
Longman
,
and
every
body
,
my
naughty
master
not
except
;
 
<EOS>
for
I
wish
him
to
live
and
repent
of
all
his
wickedness
to
poor
me
.
  
<EOS>
o
dear
heart
!
<EOS>
what
a
world
do
we
live
in
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
now

my
pen
again
:
<EOS>
but
I

and

<EOS>
,

think
;
and
though

over

<EOS>
and
I

.
 
<EOS>
but
I
long
to
say
more
;
only
that
nasty
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
up
,
and
lock
myself
in
my
closet
,
and
open
the
letter
;
and
this
be
a
copy
of
it
:
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
pamela
,
  
"
I
send
purposely
to
you
on
an
affair
that
concern
you
very
much
,
and
me
somewhat
,
but
chiefly
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
conscious
that
I
have
proceed
by
you
in
such
a
manner
as
may
justly
alarm
your
fear
,
and
give
concern
to
your
honest
friend
:
and
all
my
pleasure
be
,
that
I
can
and
will
make
you
amend
for
the
disturbance
I
have
give
you
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
promise
,
I
send
to
your
father
the
day
after
your
departure
,
that
he
may
not
be
too
much
concerned
for
you
,
and
assure
him
of
my
honour
to
you
;
and
make
an
excuse
,
such
an
one
as
ought
to
have
satisfy
him
,
for
your
not
come
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
sufficient
,
it
seem
;
for
he
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
come
to
me
next
morning
,
and
set
my
family
almost
in
an
uproar
about
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
my
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
what
trouble
have
not
your
obstinacy
give
me
,
and
yourself
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
way
to
pacify
him
,
but
to
promise
that
he
should
see
a
letter
write
from
you
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
to
satisfy
him
you
be
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
all
my
care
in
this
case
be
for
your
aged
parent
,
lest
they
should
be
touch
with
too
fatal
a
grief
;
and
for
you
,
whose
duty
and
affection
for
them
<EOS>
I
know
to
be
so
strong
and
laudable
;
for
this
reason
I
beg
you
will
write
a
few
line
to
them
,
and
let
me
prescribe
the
form
;
which
I
have
do
,
put
myself
as
near
as
I
can
in
your
place
,
and
express
your
sense
,
with
a
warmth
that
I
doubt
will
have
too
much
possess
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
what
be
do

and
which
can
not
now
be
help
,
but
which
,
I
assure
you
,
shall
turn
out
honourably
for
you
,
I
expect
not
to
be
refuse
;
because
I
can
not
possibly
have
any
view
in
it
,
but
to
satisfy
your
parent
;
which
be
more
your
concern
than
mine
;
and
so
I
must
beg
you
will
not
alter
one
tittle
of
the
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
send
it
,
or
that
it
should
answer
the
good
end
I
propose
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
promise
,
that
I
will
not
approach
you
without
your
leave

<EOS>
if
I
find
you
easy
,
and
not
attempt
to
dispute
or
avoid
your
present
lot

I
will
keep
to
my
word

although
it
be
a
difficulty
upon
me

your
restraint
last
long

I
will
assure
you

you
of
my

Yours

"
  
<EOS>
the
letter
he
prescribe
for
me
be
as
this
:
  
"

the
anguish

I
think
,
when
I
have
write
this
letter
,
and
that
which
he
have
prescribe
,
it
would
look
like
place
a
confidence
in
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
shew
them
to
her
;
and
I
shew
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
my
master
's
letter
to
me
;
for
I
believe
the
value
he
express
for
me
,
would
give
me
credit
with
one
who
profess
in
every
thing
to
serve
him
,
right
or
wrong
;
though
I
have
so
little
reason
,
I
fear
,
to
pride
myself
in
it
:
and
I
be
not
mistake
;
for
it
have
seem
to
influence
her
not
a
little
,
and
she
be
at
present
mighty
obliging
,
and
run
over
in
my
praise
;
but
be
the
less
to
be
minded
,
because
she
praise
as
much
the
author
of
my
misery
,
and
his
honourable
intention
,
as
she
call
them
;
for
I
see
,
that
she
be
capable
of
thinking
,
as
I
fear
he
do
,
that
every
thing
that
make
for
his
wicked
will
be
honourable
,
though
to
the
ruin
of
the
innocent

<EOS>
pray
God
<EOS>
I
may
find
it
otherwise

though
,
I
hope

whatever
the
wicked

may
intend
,
that
I
shall
be
at
last
rid
of
her
impertinent
bold
way
of
talk

she
seem

from
his

opportunity

into

so
she
bring
up
a
message
to
me
from

this
morning
that
he
be
go

<EOS>
I
desire
he
may
come
up
to
my

as
I

she
come
with
him

be

full

at
take

I
give

two

see

I

no

your

stand

<EOS>
o

deceitfulness
of
the

<EOS>
this
John

that
I
take

be
the
honest
of
man

that
you
take
for
the

that
be
always
praise
you
to

and
me
to

and
for
nothing
so
much
as
for
our
honest
heart

very
fellow
be
all

a
vile
hypocrite

and
a
perfidious
wretch

and
help
to
carry
on
my
ruin

<EOS>
but
he
say
so
much
of
himself
,
that
I
will
only
sit
down
with
this
sad
reflection
,
<EOS>
that
power
and
rich
never
want
tool
to
promote
their
vilest
end
,
and
there
be
nothing
so
hard
to
be
know
as
the
heart
of
man
:
 
<EOS>
I
can
<EOS>
but
pity
the
poor
wretch
,
since
he
seem
to
have
great
remorse
,
and
I
believe
it
good
to
keep
his
wickedness
secret
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
lie
in
my
way
,
I
will
encourage
his
penitence
;
for
I
may
possibly
make
some
discovery
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
I
should
mention
in
this
place
;
he
bring
down
,
in
a
portmanteau
,
all
the
clothe
and
thing
<EOS>
my
lady
and
master
have
give
me
,
and
moreover
two
velvet
hood
,
and
a
velvet
scarf
,
that
use
to
be
wear
by
my
lady
;
but
I
have
no
comfort
in
them
,
or
any
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
the
portmanteau
bring
into
my
closet
,
and
she
shew
me
what
be
in
it
;
but
then
lock
it
up
,
and
say
,
she
would
let
me
have
what
I
would
out
of
it
,
when
I
ask
;
but
if
I
have
the
key
,
it
may
make
me
want
to
go
abroad
,
may
be
;
and
so
the
confident
woman
put
it
in
her
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
myself
over
to
sad
reflection
upon
this
strange
and
surprising
discovery
of
John
's
,
and
weep
much
for
him
,
and
for
myself
too
;
for
now
I
see
,
as
he
say
,
my
ruin
have
be
long
hatching
,
that
I
can
make
no
doubt
what
my
master
's
honourable
profession
will
end
in
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
heap
of
hard
name
do
the
poor
fellow
call
himself
!
 
<EOS>
but
what
must
they
deserve
,
then
,
who
set
him
to
work
?
 
<EOS>
o
what
have
this
wicked
master
to
answer
for
,
to
be
so
corrupt
himself
,
and
to
corrupt
other
,
who
would
have
be
all
innocent
;
and
to
carry
on
a
poor
plot
,
I
be
sure
for
a
gentleman
,
to
ruin
a
poor
creature
,
who
never
do
him
harm
,
nor
wish
him
any
;
and
who
can
still
pray
for
his
happiness
,
and
his
repentance
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
wonder
what
these
gentleman
,
as
they
be
call
,
can
think
of
themselves
for
these
vile
doing
!
 
<EOS>
John
have
some
inducement
;
for
he
hope
to
please
his
master
,
who
reward
him
and
be
bountiful
to
him
;
and
the
same
may
be
say
,
bad
as
she
be
,
for
this
same
odious
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
inducement
have
my
master
for
take
so
much
pain
to
do
the
devil
's
work
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
love
me
,
as
'
tis
falsely
call
,
must
he
therefore
lay
trap
for
me
,
to
ruin
me
and
make
me
as
bad
as
himself
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
what
good
the
undoing
of
such
a
poor
creature
as
I
can
procure
him
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
be
a
very
worthless
body
.
 
<EOS>
People
,
indeed
,
say
I
be
handsome
;
but
if
I
be
so
,
should
not
a
gentleman
prefer
an
honest
servant
to
a
guilty
harlot
?
 
<EOS>
and
must
he
be
more
earnest
to
seduce
me
,
because
I
dread
of
all
thing
to
be
seduce
,
and
would
rather
lose
my
life
than
my
honesty
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
these
be
strange
thing
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
them
,
for
my
share
;
but
sure
nobody
will
say
,
that
these
fine
gentleman
have
any
tempter
but
their
own
wicked
will
!
 
<EOS>
his
naughty
master
could
run
away
from
me
,
when
he
apprehend
his
servant
may
discover
his
vile
attempt
upon
me
in
that
sad
closet
affair
;
but
be
it
not
strange
that
he
should
not
be
afraid
of
the
all
-
see
eye
,
from
which
even
that
base
plot
heart
of
his
,
in
its
most
secret
motion
,
could
not
be
hide
?
 
<EOS>
but
what
avail
me
<EOS>
these
sorrowful
reflection
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
and
will
be
wicked
,
and
design
me
a
victim
to
his
lawless
attempt
,
if
the
God
in
whom
I
trust
,
and
to
whom
I
hourly
pray
,
prevent
it
not
.

Tuesday
and
Wednesday

have
be
hinder
by
this
wicked
woman
's
watch
me
so
close
,
from
write
on
Tuesday
;
and
so
I
will
put
both
these
day
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
little
turn
with
her
for
an
airing
,
in
the
chariot
,
and
walk
several
time
in
the
garden
;
but
have
always
her
at
my
heel
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
come
to
see
us
,
and
take
a
walk
with
us
once
;
and
while
her
back
be
just
turn
,
(
encourage
by
the
hint
he
have
before
give
me
,
)
<EOS>
I
say
,
Sir
,
I
see
two
tile
upon
that
parsley
-
bed
;
may
not
one
cover
them
with
mould
,
with
a
note
between
them
,
on
occasion
?
 
<EOS>
a
good
hint
,
say
he
;
let
that
sunflow
by
the
back
-
door
of
the
garden
be
the
place
;
I
have
a
key
to
the
door
;
for
it
be
my
near
way
to
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
be
force
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
o
what
invention
will
necessity
push
us
upon
!
<EOS>
I
hug
myself
at
the
thought
;
and
she
come
to
us
,
he
say
,
as
if
he
be
continue
a
discourse
we
be
in
:
no
,
not
extraordinary
pleasant
.
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
say
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
only
,
say
he
,
the
town
,
I
be
say
,
be
not
very
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
say
she
,
it
be
not
;
it
be
a
poor
town
,
to
my
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
any
gentry
in
it
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
chat
on
about
the
town
,
to
deceive
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
deceit
intend
no
hurt
to
any
body
.
  
<EOS>
We
then
talk
of
the
garden
,
how
large
and
pleasant
,
and
the
like
;
and
sit
down
on
the
tufted
slope
of
the
fine
fish
-
pond
,
to
see
the
fish
play
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
;
and
she
say
,
I
should
angle
if
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
,
say
I
,
you
would
be
so
kind
to
fetch
me
a
rod
and
bait
.
 
<EOS>
pretty
mistress
!
<EOS>
say
she
 
<EOS>
I
know
better
than
that

I
will
assure
you
,
at
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
no
harm
,
say
I
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
tell
you
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
none
who
have
their
thought
more
about
them
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
a
body
ought
to
look
to
it
where
you
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
will
angle
a
little
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
who
be
much
afraid
of
her
,
turn
the
discourse
to
a
general
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
saunter
in
,
and
leave
them
to
talk
by
themselves
;
but
he
go
away
to
town
,
and
she
be
soon
after
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
get
to
my
pen
and
ink
;
and
I
say
,
I
want
some
paper
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
(
put
what
I
be
about
in
my
bosom
:
)
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
write
two
letter
,
and
send
them
by
John
.
 
<EOS>
(
o
how
his
name
,
poor
guilty
fellow
,
grieve
me
!
)
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
<EOS>
,
you
have
some
left
;
one
sheet
do
for
those
two
letter
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
I
;
but
I
use
half
another
for
a
cover
,
you
know
;
and
see
how
I
have
scribble
the
other
half
;
and
so
I
shew
her
a
parcel
of
broken
scrap
of
verse
,
which
I
have
try
to
recollect
,
and
have
write
purposely
that
she
may
see
,
and
think
me
usually
employ
to
such
idle
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
so
you
have
;
well
,
I
will
give
you
two
sheet
more
;
but
let
me
see
how
you
dispose
of
them
,
either
write
or
blank
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
think
I
<EOS>
,
I
hope
still
,
Argus
,
to
be
too
hard
for
thee
.
<EOS>
now
Argus
,
the
poet
say
,
have
a
hundred
eye
,
and
be
set
to
watch
with
them
all
,
as
she
do
.
  
<EOS>
She
bring
me
the
paper
,
and
say
,
now
,
<EOS>
madam
,
let
me
see
you
write
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
say
I
;
and
take
the
pen
and
write
,
"
I
wish
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
be
so
good
to
me
,
as
I
would
be
to
her
,
if
I
have
it
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
that
be
pretty
now
,
say
she
;
<EOS>
well
,
I
hope
I
be
;
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
why
then
(
write
I
)
<EOS>
she
would
do
me
the
favour
to
let
me
know
,
what
I
have
do
to
be
make
her
prisoner
;
and
what
she
think
be
to
become
of
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
well
,
and
what
then
?
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
of
consequence
,
(
scribble
I
,
)
<EOS>
she
would
let
me
see
her
instruction
,
that
I
may
know
how
far
to
blame
,
or
to
acquit
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
I
fool
on
,
to
shew
her
my
fondness
for
scribble
;
for
I
have
no
expectation
of
any
good
from
her
;
that
so
she
may
suppose
I
employ
myself
,
as
I
say
,
to
no
well
purpose
at
other
time
:
for
she
will
have
it
,
that
I
be
upon
some
plot
,
I
be
so
silent
,
and
love
so
much
to
be
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
make
me
write
on
a
little
further
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
I
;
you
have
not
answer
me
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
what
can
you
doubt
,
when
my
master
himself
assure
you
of
his
honour
?
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
I
;
but
lay
your
hand
to
your
heart
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
tell
me
,
if
you
yourself
believe
him
.
<EOS>
yes
,
say
she
,
to
be
sure
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
I
,
what
do
you
call
honour
?
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
what
do
he
call
honour
,
think
you
?
 
<EOS>
Ruin
!
<EOS>
shame
!
<EOS>
disgrace
!
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
fear
.
 
<EOS>
Pho
!
<EOS>
pho
!
<EOS>
say
she
;
if
you
have
any
doubt
about
it
,
he
can
best
explain
his
own
meaning
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
him
word
to
come
and
satisfy
you
,
if
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
Horrid
creature
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
all
in
a
fright
 
<EOS>
Can'st
thou
not
stab
me
to
the
heart
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
<EOS>
thou
would'st
,
than
say
such
another
word
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
there
be
no
such
thought
of
his
come
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
the
wickedness
to
say
,
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
he
do
not
intend
to
come
,
as
I
know
of
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
he
,
I
would
not
be
long
away
.
 
<EOS>
what
mean
the
woman
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
Mean
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
(
turn
it
off
;
)
<EOS>
why
I
mean
,
I
would
come
,
if
I
be
he
,
and
put
an
end
to
all
your
fear
 
by
make
you
as
happy
as
you
wish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
out
of
his
power
,
say
I
,
to
make
me
happy
,
great
and
rich
as
he
be
!
<EOS>
but
by
leave
me
innocent
,
and
give
me
liberty
to
go
to
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
away
soon
after
,
and
I
end
my
letter
,
in
hope
to
have
an
opportunity
to
lay
it
in
the
appoint
place
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
her
,
and
say
;
I
suppose
,
as
it
be
not
dark
,
I
may
take
another
turn
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
,
say
she
;
but
if
you
will
go
,
do
not
stay
;
and
,
Nan
,
see
and
attend
madam
,
as
she
call
me
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
towards
the
pond
,
the
maid
follow
me
,
and
dropt
purposely
my
hussy
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
come
near
the
tile
,
I
say
,
Mrs.
Anne
,
I
have
dropt
my
hussy
;
be
so
kind
as
to
look
for
it
;
I
have
it
by
the
pond
side
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
back
to
look
,
and
I
slipt
the
note
between
the
tile
,
and
cover
them
as
quick
as
I
could
with
the
light
mould
,
quite
unperceived
;
and
the
maid
find
the
hussy
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
and
saunter
in
again
,
and
meet
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
to
see
after
me
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
write
be
this
:
  
"
REVEREND
SIR
,
  
"
<EOS>
the
want
of
an
opportunity
to
speak
my
mind
to
you
,
I
be
sure
will
excuse
this
boldness
in
a
poor
creature
that
be
betray
hither
,
I
have
reason
to
think
,
for
the
bad
of
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
something
,
to
be
sure
,
of
my
story
,
my
native
poverty
,
which
I
be
not
ashamed
of
,
my
late
lady
's
goodness
,
and
my
master
's
design
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
he
promise
honour
,
and
all
that
;
but
the
honour
of
the
wicked
be
disgrace
and
shame
to
the
virtuous
:
and
he
may
think
he
keep
his
promise
,
accord
to
the
notion
he
may
allow
himself
to
hold
;
and
yet
,
accord
to
nine
and
every
good
body
's
,
basely
ruin
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
wretched
,
and
ill
-
treat
by
this
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
she
be
so
ill
-
principle
a
woman
,
that
,
as
I
may
soon
want
the
opportunity
which
the
happy
hint
of
this
day
afford
to
my
hope
,
I
throw
myself
at
once
upon
your
goodness
,
without
the
least
reserve
;
for
I
can
not
be
bad
than
I
be
,
should
that
fail
me
;
which
,
I
dare
say
,
to
your
power
,
it
will
not
:
<EOS>
for
I
see
it
,
sir
,
in
your
look
,
I
hope
it
from
your
cloth
,
and
I
doubt
it
not
from
your
inclination
,
in
a
case
circumstance
as
my
unhappy
one
be
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
sir
,
in
help
me
out
of
my
present
distress
,
you
perform
all
the
act
of
religion
in
one
;
and
the
high
mercy
and
charity
,
both
to
the
body
and
soul
of
a
poor
wretch
,
that
,
believe
me
,
sir
,
have
,
at
present
,
not
so
much
as
in
thought
swerve
from
her
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
not
some
way
to
be
find
out
for
my
escape
,
without
danger
to
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
be
there
no
gentleman
or
lady
of
virtue
in
this
neighbourhood
,
to
whom
I
may
fly
,
only
till
l
can
find
a
way
to
get
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
?
 
<EOS>
can
not
Lady
Davers
be
make
acquainted
with
my
sad
story
,
by
your
convey
a
letter
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
My
poor
parent
be
so
low
in
the
world
,
they
can
do
nothing
but
break
their
heart
for
me
;
and
that
,
I
fear
,
will
be
the
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
master
promise
,
if
I
will
be
easy
,
as
he
call
it
,
in
my
present
lot
,
he
will
not
come
down
without
my
consent
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
this
be
nothing
:
for
what
be
the
promise
of
a
person
who
think
himself
at
liberty
to
act
as
he
have
do
by
me
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
come
,
it
must
be
to
ruin
me
;
and
come
to
be
sure
he
will
,
when
he
think
he
have
silence
the
clamour
of
my
friend
,
and
lull
me
,
as
no
doubt
he
hope
,
into
a
fatal
security
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
therefore
,
sir
,
be
all
the
time
I
have
to
work
and
struggle
for
the
preservation
of
my
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
stay
till
he
come
,
I
be
undone

<EOS>
You
have
a
key
to
the
back
garden
door
;
I
have
great
hope
from
that
.
 
<EOS>
Study
,
good
sir
,
and
contrive
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
faithfully
keep
your
secret
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
should
be
loath
to
have
you
suffer
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
,
but
commit
this
to
the
happy
tile
,
in
the
bosom
of
that
earth

where
,
I
hope
,
my
deliverance
will
take
root

bring
forth
such
fruit

as
may
turn
to
my
inexpressible
joy

and
your

"
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
this
complete
a
terrible
week
since
my
setting
out
,
as
I
hope
to
see
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
different
be
my
hope
then
,
from
what
they
be
now
!
 
<EOS>
yet
who
know
what
these
happy
tile
may
produce
!
  
<EOS>
but
I
must
tell
you
,
first
,
how
I
have
be
beat
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
true
!
 
<EOS>
and
thus
it
come
about
:
  
<EOS>
My
impatience
be
great
to
walk
in
the
garden
,
to
see
if
any
thing
have
offer
,
answerable
to
my
hope
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
wicked
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
not
let
me
go
without
her
;
and
say
,
she
be
not
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
many
word
about
it
;
for
I
tell
her
,
it
be
very
hard
I
could
not
be
trust
to
walk
by
myself
in
the
garden
for
a
little
air
,
but
must
be
dog
and
watch
bad
than
a
thief
.
  
<EOS>
She
still
plead
her
instruction
,
and
say
she
be
not
to
trust
me
out
of
her
sight
:
<EOS>
and
you
have
well
,
say
she
,
be
easy
and
contented
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
for
I
have
bad
order
than
you
have
yet
find
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
add
she
,
your
ask
Mr.
Williams
,
if
there
be
any
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
?
 
<EOS>
this
make
me
suspect
you
want
to
get
away
to
them
,
to
tell
your
sad
dismal
story
,
as
you
call
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
be
at
my
mouth
;
for
I
fear
,
by
that
hint
,
she
have
see
my
letter
under
the
tile
:
<EOS>
o
how
uneasy
I
be
!
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
,
well
,
since
you
take
on
so
,
you
may
take
a
turn
,
and
I
will
be
with
you
in
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
out
of
sight
of
her
window
,
I
speed
towards
the
hopeful
place
;
but
be
soon
force
to
slacken
my
pace
,
by
her
odious
voice
:
Hey
-
day
,
why
so
nimble
,
and
whither
so
fast
?
<EOS>
say
she
:
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
be
you
upon
a
wager
?
 
<EOS>
I
stopt
for
her
,
till
her
pursy
side
be
waddle
up
to
me
;
and
she
hold
by
my
arm
,
half
out
of
breath
:
<EOS>
so
I
be
force
to
pass
by
the
dear
place
,
without
dare
to
look
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
gardener
be
at
work
a
little
farther
,
and
so
we
look
upon
him
,
and
I
begin
to
talk
about
his
art
;
but
she
say
,
softly
,
My
instruction
be
,
not
to
let
you
be
so
familiar
with
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
be
you
afraid
I
should
confederate
with
them
to
commit
a
robbery
upon
my
master
?
<EOS>
May
be
I
be
,
say
the
odious
wretch
;
for
to
rob
him
of
yourself
,
would
be
the
bad
that
could
happen
to
him
,
in
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
and
pray
,
say
I
,
walk
on
<EOS>
,
how
come
I
to
be
his
property
?
 
<EOS>
what
right
have
he
in
me
,
but
such
as
a
thief
<EOS>
may
plead
to
steal
good
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
be
ever
the
like
hear
?
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
downright
rebellion
,
I
protest
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
lambkin
,
(
which
the
foolish
often
call
me
,
)
if
I
be
in
his
place
,
he
should
not
have
his
property
in
you
long
questionable
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
what
would
you
do
,
say
I
,
if
you
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
not
stand
shill
-
<EOS>
I
-
shall
-
I
,
as
he
do
;
but
put
you
and
himself
both
out
of
your
pain
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
Jezebel
,
say
I
,
(
I
could
not
help
it
,
)
would
you
ruin
me
by
force
?
 
<EOS>
upon
this
she
give
me
a
deadly
slap
upon
my
shoulder
:
<EOS>
take
that
,
say
she
;
whom
do
you
call
Jezebel
?
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
surprised
,
(
for
you
never
beat
me
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
in
your
life
,
)
<EOS>
that
I
be
like
one
thunder
-
strike
;
and
look
round
,
as
if
I
want
somebody
to
help
me
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
nobody
;
and
say
,
at
last
,
rub
my
shoulder
,
be
this
also
in
your
instruction
?
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
for
me
!
<EOS>
be
I
to
be
beat
too
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
fall
a
crying
,
and
throw
myself
upon
the
grass
-
walk
we
be
upon
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
,
in
a
great
pet
,
I
will
not
be
call
such
name
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Marry
come
up
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
have
a
spirit
:
You
must
and
shall
be
keep
under
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
manage
such
little
provoking
thing
as
you
,
I
warrant
ye
!
 
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
we
will
go
in
a'doors
,
and
I
will
lock
you
up
,
and
you
shall
have
no
shoe
,
nor
any
thing
else
,
if
this
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
cruel
thing
to
me
,
and
I
blame
myself
for
my
free
speech
;
for
now
I
have
give
her
some
pretence
:
<EOS>
and
o
!
<EOS>
think
<EOS>
I
,
here
I
have
,
by
my
malapertness
,
ruin
the
only
project
I
have
leave
.
  
<EOS>
the
gardener
see
this
scene
:
but
she
call
to
him
,
<EOS>
well
,
Jacob
,
what
do
you
stare
at
?
 
<EOS>
pray
mind
what
you
be
upon
.
 
<EOS>
and
away
he
walk
,
to
another
quarter
,
out
of
sight
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
think
I
,
I
must
put
on
the
dissembler
a
little
,
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
my
hand
roughly
;
come
,
get
up
,
say
she
,
and
come
in
a'doors
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
Jezebel
you
,
I
will
so
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
dear
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I.
 
none
of
your
dear
,
and
your
coaxing
!
<EOS>
say
she
;
why
not
Jezebel
again
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
fearful
passion
,
I
see
,
and
I
be
out
of
my
wit
.
<EOS>
think
I
<EOS>
,
I
have
often
hear
woman
blame
for
their
tongue
;
I
wish
mine
have
be
short
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
go
in
,
say
I
,
indeed
I
can
not
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
can
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
warrant
I
can
take
such
a
thin
body
as
you
under
my
arm
,
and
carry
you
in
,
if
you
will
not
walk
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
my
strength
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
but
I
do
,
say
I
,
too
well
;
and
will
you
not
use
me
bad
when
I
come
in
?
 
<EOS>
so
I
arise
,
and
she
mutter
to
herself
all
the
way
<EOS>
,
She
to
be
a
Jezebel
with
me
,
that
have
use
me
so
well
!
<EOS>
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
near
the
house
,
I
say
,
sit
down
upon
a
settle
-
bench
,
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
not
go
in
,
till
you
say
you
forgive
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
forgive
my
calling
you
that
name
,
I
will
forgive
your
beat
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
down
by
me
,
and
seem
in
a
great
pucker
,
and
say
,
well
,
come
,
I
will
forgive
you
for
this
time
:
and
so
kiss
me
,
as
a
mark
of
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
but
pray
,
say
I
,
tell
me
where
I
be
to
walk
and
go
,
and
give
me
what
liberty
you
can
;
and
when
I
know
the
most
you
can
favour
me
with
,
you
shall
see
I
will
be
as
content
as
I
can
,
and
not
ask
you
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
say
she
,
this
be
something
like
:
I
wish
I
could
give
you
all
the
liberty
you
desire
;
for
you
must
think
it
be
no
pleasure
to
me
to
tie
you
to
my
petticoat
,
as
it
be
,
and
not
let
you
stir
without
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
people
that
will
do
their
duty
,
must
have
some
trouble
:
and
what
I
do
,
be
to
serve
as
good
a
master
,
to
be
sure
,
as
life
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
I
,
to
every
body
but
me
!
 
<EOS>
He
love
you
too
well
,
to
be
sure
,
return
she
;
and
that
be
the
reason
:
<EOS>
so
you
ought
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
love
!
<EOS>
replied
I.
 
Come
,
say
she
,
do
not
let
the
wench
see
you
have
be
cry
,
nor
tell
her
any
tale
:
for
you
will
not
tell
them
fairly
,
I
be
sure
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
send
her
,
and
you
shall
take
another
walk
in
the
garden
,
if
you
will
:
May
be
it
will
get
you
a
stomach
to
your
dinner
:
for
you
do
not
eat
enough
to
keep
life
and
soul
together
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
beauty
to
the
bone
,
add
the
strange
wretch
,
or
you
could
not
look
so
well
as
you
do
,
with
so
little
stomach
,
so
little
rest
,
and
so
much
pining
and
whine
for
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
think
I
,
say
what
thou
wilt
,
so
I
can
be
rid
of
thy
bad
tongue
and
company
:
and
I
hope
to
find
some
opportunity
now
to
come
at
my
sunflower
.
<EOS>
but
I
walk
the
other
way
,
to
take
that
in
my
return
,
to
avoid
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
I
force
my
discourse
to
the
maid
;
but
it
be
all
upon
general
thing
;
for
I
find
she
be
ask
after
every
thing
I
say
and
do
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
near
the
place
,
as
I
have
be
devise
,
I
say
,
pray
step
to
the
gardener
,
and
ask
him
to
gather
a
sallad
for
me
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
She
call
out
,
Jacob
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
He
can
not
hear
you
so
far
off
;
and
pray
tell
him
,
I
should
like
a
cucumber
too
,
if
he
have
one
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
stept
about
a
bow
-
shot
from
me
,
I
popt
down
,
and
whipt
my
finger
under
the
upper
tile
,
and
pull
out
a
letter
without
direction
,
and
thrust
it
in
my
bosom
,
tremble
for
joy
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
with
me
,
before
I
could
well
secure
it
;
and
I
be
in
such
a
taking
that
I
fear
I
should
discover
myself
.
 
<EOS>
You
seem
frightened
,
madam
,
say
she
;
why
,
say
I
,
with
a
lucky
thought
,
(
alas
!
<EOS>
your
poor
daughter
will
make
an
intriguer
by
and
by
;
but
I
hope
an
innocent
one
!
)
<EOS>
I
stoop
to
smell
at
the
sunflower
,
and
a
great
nasty
worm
run
into
the
ground
,
that
startle
me
;
for
I
can
not
abide
worm
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
sunflower
do
not
smell
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
find
,
replied
I.
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
walk
in
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
;
<EOS>
well
,
you
have
make
haste
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
go
another
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
my
closet
,
lock
myself
in
,
and
open
my
letter
,
find
in
it
these
word
:
  
"
I
be
infinitely
concerned
for
your
distress
.
 
<EOS>
I
most
heartily
wish
it
may
be
in
my
power
to
serve
and
save
so
much
innocence
,
beauty
,
and
merit
.
 
<EOS>
My
whole
dependance
be
upon
Mr.
B

#
,
and
I
have
a
near
view
of
be
provide
for
by
his
favour
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
I
would
sooner
forfeit
all
my
hope
in
him
,
(
trust
in
God
for
the
rest
,
)
than
not
assist
you
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
look
upon
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
in
the
light
he
now
appear
in
to
me
,
in
your
case
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
he
be
no
professed
debauchee
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
entirely
of
opinion
<EOS>
,
you
should
,
if
possible
,
get
out
of
his
hand
;
and
especially
as
you
be
in
very
bad
one
in
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
here
the
widow
Lady
Jones
,
mistress
of
a
good
fortune
;
and
a
woman
of
virtue
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
also
old
Sir
Simon
Darnford
,
and
his
lady
,
who
be
a
good
woman
;
and
they
have
two
daughter
,
virtuous
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
rest
be
but
middle
people
,
and
trader

at
good

<EOS>
I
will
try
,
if
you
please
,
either
Lady
Jones
,
or
Lady
Darnford
,
if
they
will
permit
you
to
take
refuge
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
no
probability
of
keep
myself
conceal
in
this
matter
;
but
will
,
as
I
say
,
risk
all
thing
to
serve
you
;
for
I
never
see
a
sweetness
and
innocence
like
yours

and
your
hard
case
have
attach
me
entirely
to
you

I
know
,
as
you
so
happily
express

if
I
can
serve
you
in
this
case

I
shall
thereby
perform
all
the
act
of
religion
in
one

"
<EOS>
as
to
Lady
Davers

I
will
convey
a
letter
,
if
you
please
,
to
her
;
but
it
must
not
be
from
our
post

I
give
you
caution

for
the

owe
all
his
bread
to
Mr.

his

You

give
me
leave

greatly
short
of

o
how
suited

God
bless

I
now
think
I

begin
to
be
happy

<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
have
you
suffer
on
my
account

I
hope
it
will
be
make
up
to
you
an
hundred

fold
,
by
that
God
whom
you
so
faithfully
serve
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
too
happy
<EOS>
,
could
I
ever
have
it
in
my
power
to
contribute
in
the
least
to
it

<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
to
serve
me
,
must
be
for
God
's
sake
only
;
for
I
be
poor
and
lowly
in
fortune
;
though
in
mind
,
I
hope
,
too
high
to
do
a
mean
or
unworthy
deed
to
gain
a
kingdom

I
lose
time

<EOS>

"
any
way
you
think
best
,
I
should
be
pleased
with
;
for
I
know
not
the
person

in
what
manner
it
be
good
to
apply
to
them

<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
the
hint
you
so
kindly
give
me
of
the
man
at
the
post

house

<EOS>
I
be
think
of
open
a
way
for
myself
by
letter
,
when
I
could
have
opportunity
;
but
I
see
more
and
more
that
I
be
,
indeed
,
strangely
surround
with
danger
;
and
that
there
be
no
dependance
to
be
make
on
my
master
's
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
,
sir
,
if
either
of
those
lady
would
give
leave
,
I
may
some
way
get
out
by
favour
of
your
key
:
and
as
it
be
impossible
,
watch
as
I
be
,
to
know
when
it
can
be
,
suppose
,
sir
,
you
get
one
make
by
it
,
and
put
it
,
the
next
opportunity
,
under
the
sunflower
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
no
time
be
to
be
lose
,
because
it
be
rather
my
wonder
,
that
she
be
not
thoughtful
about
this
key
,
than
otherwise
;
for
she
forget
not
the
minute
thing
.
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
if
I
have
this
key
,
I
could
,
if
these
lady
would
not
shelter
me
,
run
away
any
where
:
and
if
I
be
once
out
of
the
house
,
they
could
have
no
pretence
to
force
me
again
;
for
I
have
do
no
harm
,
and
hope
to
make
my
story
good
to
any
compassionate
body
;
and
by
this
way
you
need
not
to
be
know

<EOS>
torture
should
not
wring
it
from
me

I
assure
you

"
one
thing
more
,
good
sir

<EOS>
have
you
no
correspondence
with
my
master
's
Bedfordshire
family

<EOS>
by
that
mean
,
may
be

I
could
be
inform
of
his

hither

when
I
enclose
you
a
letter
of
a
deceitful
wretch

I
can
trust
you
with
any
thing

<EOS>
poor
John
Arnold
.
<EOS>
Its
content
will
tell
why
I
enclose
it
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
by
his
mean
,
something
may
be
discover
;
for
he
seem
willing
to
atone
for
his
treachery
to
me
,
by
the
intimation
of
future
service

<EOS>
I
leave
the
hint
to
you
to
improve
upon

I
hope
,
sir

by
your
favour
,
I
could
send
a
little
packet
,
now
and
then
,
<EOS>
some
how
,
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
stock
of
money
,
<EOS>
about
five
or
six
guinea
<EOS>
:
Shall
I
put
half
in
your
hand
,
to
defray
the
charge
of
a
man
and
horse
,
or
any
other
incident
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
but
just
time
to
transcribe
this
,
before
I
be
call
to
dinner
;
and
I
put
that
for
Mr.
Williams
,
with
a
wafer
in
it
,
in
my
bosom
,
to
get
an
opportunity
to
lay
it
in
the
dear
place
.
  
<EOS>
o
good
sir
,
of
all
the
flower
in
the
garden
,
the
sunflow
,
sure
,
be
the
lovely
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
propitious
one
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
how
nobly
my
plot
succeed
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
begin
to
be
afraid
my
writing
may
be
discover
;
for
they
grow
large
:
I
stitch
them
hitherto
in
my
under
-
coat
,
next
my
linen
.
<EOS>
but
if
this
brute
should
search
me
 
I
must
try
to
please
her
,
and
then
she
will
not
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
but
just
come
off
from
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
have
deposit
my
letter
by
a
simple
wile
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
some
horse
-
bean
;
and
we
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
,
to
angle
,
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
promise
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
bait
the
hook
,
and
I
hold
it
,
and
soon
hook
a
lovely
carp
.
 
<EOS>
play
it
,
play
it
,
say
she
:
<EOS>
I
do
,
and
bring
it
to
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
a
sad
thought
just
then
come
into
my
head
;
and
I
take
it
,
and
throw
it
in
again
;
and
<EOS>
o
the
pleasure
<EOS>
it
seem
to
have
,
to
flounce
in
,
when
at
liberty
!
 
<EOS>
why
this
?
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
o
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
I
be
think
this
poor
carp
be
the
unhappy
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
liken
you
and
myself
to
my
naughty
master
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
hook
and
deceive
the
poor
carp
,
so
be
I
betray
by
false
bait
;
and
when
you
say
,
play
it
,
play
it
,
it
go
to
my
heart
,
to
think
I
should
sport
with
the
destruction
of
the
poor
fish
I
have
betray
;
and
I
could
not
but
fling
it
in
again
:
and
do
you
not
see
the
joy
with
which
the
happy
carp
flounce
from
us
?
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
may
some
good
merciful
body
procure
me
<EOS>
my
liberty
in
the
same
manner
<EOS>
;
for
to
be
sure
,
I
think
my
danger
equal
!
  
<EOS>
Lord
bless
thee
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
what
a
thought
be
there
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
can
angle
no
more
,
add
I.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
my
fortune
,
say
she
,
and
take
the
rod
.
 
<EOS>
Do
,
answer
I
;
and
I
will
plant
life
,
if
I
can
,
while
you
be
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
horse
-
bean
here
,
and
will
go
and
stick
them
in
one
of
the
border
,
to
see
how
long
they
will
be
come
up
;
and
I
will
call
them
my
garden
.
  
<EOS>
so
you
see
,
dear
father
and
mother
,
<EOS>
(
I
hope
now
you
will
soon
see
;
for
,
may
be
,
if
I
can
not
get
away
<EOS>
so
soon
myself
,
I
may
send
my
paper
some
<EOS>
how
;
I
say
you
will
see
,
)
that
this
furnish
me
with
a
good
excuse
to
look
after
my
garden
another
time
;
and
if
the
mould
should
look
a
little
freshish
,
it
will
not
be
so
much
suspect
.
 
<EOS>
She
mistrust
nothing
of
this
;
and
I
go
and
stick
in
here
<EOS>
and
there
my
bean
,
for
about
the
length
of
five
ell
,
of
each
side
of
the
sunflower
;
and
easily
deposit
my
letter
.
<EOS>
and
not
a
little
proud
am
I
of
this
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
sure
something
will
do
at
last
!
  
<EOS>
Friday
,
Saturday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
now
tell
you
a
trick
of
mine
;
now
I
will
tell
you
a
trick
of
this
wicked
woman
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
up
to
me
:
<EOS>
say
she
,
I
have
a
bill
I
can
not
change
till
to
-
morrow
;
and
a
tradesman
want
his
money
most
sadly
:
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
love
to
turn
poor
trade
-
folk
away
without
their
money
:
have
you
any
about
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
,
reply
I
:
how
much
will
do
?
 
<EOS>
oh
!
say
she
,
I
want
eight
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Alack
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
I
have
but
between
five
and
six
.
 
<EOS>
lend
me
that
,
say
she
,
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
;
and
she
go
down
stair
:
<EOS>
and
when
she
come
up
,
she
laugh
,
and
say
,
well
,
I
have
pay
the
tradesman
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
give
it
me
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
at
that
,
the
assurance
,
laugh
loud
,
say
,
why
,
what
occasion
have
you
for
money
?
 
<EOS>
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
lambkin
,
I
do
not
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
fear
you
may
make
a
bad
use
of
it
;
and
now
I
can
trust
Nan
with
you
a
little
oftener
,
especially
as
I
have
get
the
key
of
your
portmanteau
;
so
that
you
can
neither
corrupt
her
with
money
,
nor
fine
thing
.
 
<EOS>
never
do
any
body
look
more
silly
than
i.
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
fret
,
to
be
so
foolishly
outwit
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
more
,
as
I
have
hint
to
Mr.
Williams
<EOS>
,
that
I
would
put
some
in
his
hand
to
defray
the
charge
of
my
sending
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
cry
for
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
have
not
five
shilling
leave
to
support
me
,
if
I
can
get
away
.
 
<EOS>
be
ever
such
a
fool
as
I
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
pride
myself
in
my
contrivance
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
say
I.
 
be
this
your
instruction
,
wolfkin
?
<EOS>
(
for
she
call
me
lambkin
)
.
 
<EOS>
Jezebel
,
you
mean
,
child
!
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
now
forgive
you
heartily
;
let
's
buss
and
be
friend
.
 
<EOS>
out
upon
you
say
I
;
I
can
not
bear
you
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
durst
not
call
her
name
again
;
for
I
dread
her
huge
paw
most
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
of
this
thing
,
the
more
do
I
regret
it
,
and
blame
myself
.
  
<EOS>
this
night
the
man
from
the
post
-
house
bring
a
letter
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
in
which
be
one
enclose
for
me
:
She

it
me
up
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
,
well
,
my
good
master
do
not
forget
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
send
you
a
letter
:
and
see
what
he
write
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
read
<EOS>
,
that
he
hope
her
fair
charge
be
well
,
happy
,
and
contented
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
to
be
sure
,
say
I
,
I
can
not
choose
 
that
he
do
not
doubt
her
care
and
kindness
to
me
:
that
I
be
very
dear
to
him
,
and
she
could
not
use
me
too
well
;
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
master
for
you
!
<EOS>
say
she
:
sure
you
will
love
and
pray
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
her
to
read
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
say
she
,
but
I
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
be
there
any
order
for
take
my
shoe
away
,
and
for
beat
me
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
,
nor
about
Jezebel
<EOS>
neither
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
return
I
<EOS>
,
I
cry
truce
;
for
I
have
no
mind
to
be
beat
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
say
she
,
we
have
forgive
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
My
letter
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
my
dear
pamela
,
  
"
I
begin
to
repent
already
,
that
I
have
bind
myself
,
by
promise
,
not
to
see
you
till
you
give
me
leave
;
for
I
think
the
time
very
tedious
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
place
so
much
confidence
in
me
,
as
to
invite
me
down
?
 
<EOS>
assure
yourself
,
that
your
generosity
shall
not
be
throw
away
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
the
rather
would
press
this
,
as
I
be
uneasy
for
your
uneasiness
;
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
acquaint
me
,
that
you
take
your
restraint
very
heavily
;
and
neither
eat
,
drink
,
nor
rest
well
;
and
I
have
too
great
interest
in
your
health
,
not
to
wish
to
shorten
the
time
of
this
trial
;
which
will
be
the
consequence
of
my
come
down
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
too
,
have
intimate
to
me
your
concern
,
with
a
grief
that
hardly
give
him
leave
for
utterance
;
a
grief
that
a
little
alarmed
my
tenderness
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
I
fear
any
thing
,
but
that
your
disregard
to
me
,
which
yet
my
proud
heart
will
hardly
permit
me
to
own
,
may
throw
you
upon
some
rashness
,
that
may
encourage
a
daring
hope
:
<EOS>
but
how
poorly
do
I
descend
,
to
be
anxious
about
such
a
menial
as
he
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
one
thing
,
that
if
you
will
give
me
leave
to
attend
you
at
the
Hall
,
(
consider
who
it
be
that
request
this
from
you
as
a
favour
,
)
I
solemnly
declare
,
that
you
shall
have
cause
to
be
pleased
with
this
obliging
mark
of
your
confidence
in
me
,
and
consideration
for
me
;
and
if
I
find
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
not
behave
to
you
with
the
respect
due
to
one
<EOS>
I
so
dearly
love
,
I
will
put
it
entirely
into
your
power
to
discharge
her
the
house
,
if
you
think
proper
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
or
who
else
you
please
,
shall
attend
you
in
her
place
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
say
on
a
hint
John
give
me
,
as
if
you
resent
something
from
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Dearest
Pamela
,
answer
favourably
this
earnest
request
of
one
that
can
not
live
without
you
,
and
on
whose
honour
to
you
,
you
may
absolutely
depend
;
and
so
much
the
more
,
as
you
place
a
confidence
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
and
assuredly
ever
will
be
,
                       
"
Your
faithful
and
affectionate
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
glad
,
I
know
,
to
hear
your
father
and
mother
be
well
,
and
easy
upon
your
last
letter

<EOS>
that
give
me
a
pleasure
that
I
be
resolve
you
shall
not
repent
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
will
convey
to
me
your
answer
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
but
slightly
read
this
letter
for
the
present
,
to
give
way
to
one
<EOS>
I
have
hope
of
find
by
this
time
from
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
an
evening
turn
,
as
I
call
it
,
in
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
company
:
and
walk
by
the
place
,
I
say
,
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
any
of
my
bean
can
have
strike
since
yesterday
?
 
<EOS>
She
laugh
,
and
say
,
You
be
a
poor
gardener
:
<EOS>
but
I
love
to
see
you
divert
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
She
pass
on
<EOS>
,
I
find
my
good
friend
have
provide
for
me
;
and
,
slip
it
in
my
bosom
,
(
for
her
back
be
towards
me
,
)
<EOS>
here
,
say
I
,
(
have
a
bean
in
my
hand
,
)
be
one
of
them
;
but
it
have
not
stir
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
to
be
sure
,
say
she
,
and
turn
upon
me
a
most
wicked
jest
,
unbecome
the
mouth
of
a
woman
,
about
planting
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
in
,
I
hie
to
my
closet
,
and
read
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
tell
you
that
I
have
have
a
repulse
from
Lady
Jones
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
concerned
at
your
case
,
she
say
,
but
do
not
care
to
make
herself
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
I
apply
to
Lady
Darnford
,
and
tell
her
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
I
could
,
your
sad
story
,
and
shew
her
your
more
pathetic
letter
.
<EOS>
I
find
her
well
disposed
,
but
she
would
advise
with
Sir
Simon
,
who
by
the
by
be
not
a
man
of
an
extraordinary
character
for
virtue
;
but
he
say
to
his
lady
in
my
presence
,
"
why
,
what
be
all
this
,
my
dear
,
but
that
our
neighbour
have
a
mind
to
his
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
!
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
take
care
she
want
for
nothing
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
see
any
great
injury
will
be
do
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
hurt
no
family
by
this
:
"
<EOS>
(
so
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
it
seem
that
poor
people
's
honesty
be
to
go
for
nothing
)
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
,
Mr.
Williams
,
you
,
of
all
man
,
should
not
engage
in
this
affair
,
against
your
friend
and
patron
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
speak
this
in
<EOS>
so
determined
a
manner
,
that
the
lady
have
do
;
and
I
have
only
to
beg
no
notice
should
be
take
of
the
matter
as
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hint
your
case
to
Mr.
Peters
,
the
minister
of
this
parish
;
but
I
be
concerned
to
say
,
that
he
impute
selfish
view
to
me
,
as
if
I
would
make
an
interest
in
your
affection
by
my
zeal
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
represent
the
duty
of
our
function
,
and
the
like
,
and
protest
my
disinterestedness
,
he
coldly
say
,
I
be
very
good
;
but
be
a
young
man
,
and
know
little
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
it
be
a
thing
to
be
lament
,
yet
when
he
and
I
should
set
about
to
reform
mankind
in
this
respect
,
we
should
have
enough
upon
our
hand
;
for
,
he
say
,
it
be
too
common
and
fashionable
a
case
to
be
withstand
by
a
private
clergyman
or
two
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
utter
some
reflection
upon
the
conduct
of
the
present
father
of
the
church
,
in
regard
to
the
first
personage
of
the
realm
,
as
a
justification
of
his
coldness
on
this
score
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
represent
the
different
circumstance
of
your
affair
;
that
other
woman
live
evilly
by
their
own
consent
,
but
to
serve
you
,
be
to
save
an
innocence
that
have
but
few
example
;
and
then
I
shew
him
your
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
say
it
be
prettily
write
:
and
he
be
sorry
for
you
;
and
that
your
good
intention
ought
to
be
encourage
:
<EOS>
but
what
,
say
he
,
would
you
have
me
do
,
Mr.
Williams
?
 
<EOS>
why
suppose
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
give
her
shelter
in
your
house

with
your

continue

that
he

honourably

her
shyness

procure

in

what
all

be
glad

your

something

perhaps
,
will
strike
out
from

if
you

I

watch
an

if

you

best
be
very
cautious

this
evil

that

I
have
almost
a
scruple
to
take
it

as
I
be
act
so
contrary
to
his

I
hope
he
will
one

it
will
be
good
to
make
use
of
the
key

I
shall
soon
procure
you

I
can
borrow
a

I
believe

to
wait
within
half
a
mile

Your

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
a
thousand
sad
reflection
upon
the
former
part
of
this
honest
gentleman
's
kind
letter
;
and
but
for
the
hope
he
give
me
at
last
,
should
have
give
up
my
case
as
quite
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
write
to
thank
him
most
gratefully
for
his
kind
endeavour
;
to
lament
the
little
concern
the
gentry
have
for
my
deplorable
case
;
the
wickedness
of
the
world
,
first
to
give
way
to
such
iniquitous
fashion
,
and
then
plead
the
frequency
of
them
,
against
the
attempt
to
amend
them
;
and
how
unaffected
people
be
with
the
distress
of
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
recall
my
former
hint
as
to
write
to
Lady
Davers
,
which
I
fear
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
would
only
serve
to
apprise
her
brother
,
that
she
know
his
wicked
scheme
,
and
more
harden
him
in
it
,
and
make
him
come
down
the
sooner
,
and
to
be
the
more
determined
on
my
ruin
;
besides
that
it
may
make
Mr.
Williams
guess
at
,
as
a
means
of
convey
my
letter
:
and
be
very
fearful
,
that
if
that
good
lady
would
interest
herself
in
my
behalf
,
(
which
be
a
doubt
,
because
she
both
love
and
fear
her
brother
,
)
it
would
have
no
effect
upon
him
;
and
that
therefore
I
would
wait
the
happy
event
I
may
hope
for
from
his
kind
assistance
in
the
key
,
and
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
intimate
my
master
's
letter
,
beg
to
be
permit
to
come
down
:
be
fearful
it
may
be
sudden
;
and
that
I
be
of
opinion
<EOS>
no
time
be
to
be
lose
;
for
we
may
let
slip
all
our
opportunity
;
tell
him
the
money
trick
of
this
vile
woman
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
time
to
take
a
copy
of
this
letter
,
I
be
so
watch
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
it
ready
in
my
bosom
,
I
be
easy
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
go
to
seek
out
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
tell
her
,
I
would
have
her
advice
upon
the
letter
I
have
receive
from
my
master
;
<EOS>
which
point
of
confidence
in
her
pleased
her
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
she
,
now
this
be
something
like
:
and
we
will
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
,
or
where
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
pretend
it
be
indifferent
to
me
;
and
so
we
walk
into
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
talk
to
her
of
the
letter
;
but
be
far
from
acquaint
her
with
all
the
content
;
only
that
he
want
my
consent
to
come
down
,
and
hope
she
use
me
kindly
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
now
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
let
me
have
your
advice
as
to
this
.
<EOS>
why
then
,
say
she
,
I
will
give
it
you
freely
;
e'en
send
to
him
to
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
highly
oblige
him
,
and
I
dare
say
you
will
fare
the
well
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
well
?
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
I.
 
I
dare
say
,
you
think
yourself
,
that
he
intend
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
that
foolish
word
,
your
ruin
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
ne'er
a
lady
in
the
land
may
live
happy
than
you
if
you
will
,
or
be
more
honourably
use
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
I
shall
not
,
at
this
time
,
dispute
with
you
about
the
word
ruin
and
honourable
:
for
I
find
we
have
quite
different
notion
of
both
:
<EOS>
but
now
I
will
speak
plainer
than
ever
<EOS>
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
he
intend
to
make
proposal
to
me
as
to
a
keep
mistress
,
or
keep
slave
rather
,
or
do
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
lambkin
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
think
thyself
?
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
say
I
,
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
but
if
he
do
,
(
for
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
)
<EOS>
you
may
have
your
own
term
 
<EOS>
I
see
that
;
for
you
may
do
any
thing
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
this
to
be
speak
,
though
it
be
all
I
fear
of
a
long
time
;
and
begin
to
exclaim
most
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
say
she
,
he
may
marry
you
,
as
far
as
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
say
I
,
that
can
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
neither
desire
nor
expect
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
condition
do
not
permit
me
to
have
such
a
thought
;
and
that
,
and
the
whole
series
of
his
conduct
,
convince
me
of
the
contrary
;
and
you
would
have
me
invite
him
to
come
down
,
would
you
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
this
to
invite
my
ruin
?
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
what
I
would
do
,
say
she
,
in
your
place
;
and
if
it
be
to
be
as
you
think
,
I
should
rather
be
out
of
my
pain
,
than
live
in
continual
fright
and
apprehension
,
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
reply
I
,
an
hour
of
innocence
be
worth
an
age
of
guilt
;
and
be
my
life
to
be
make
ever
so
miserable
by
it
<EOS>
,
I
should
never
forgive
myself
,
if
I
be
not
to
lengthen
out
to
the
long
minute
my
happy
time
of
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
who
know
what
Providence
may
do
for
me
!
  
<EOS>
why
,
may
be
,
say
she
,
as
he
love
you
<EOS>
so
well
,
you
may
prevail
upon
him
by
your
prayer
and
tear
;
and
for
that
reason
,
I
should
think
,
you
would
better
let
him
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
I
will
write
him
a
letter
,
because
he
expect
an
answer
,
or
may
be
he
will
make
a
pretence
to
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
how
can
it
go
?
  
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
of
that
,
say
she
;
it
be
in
my
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
think
I
,
so
I
doubt
,
by
the
hint
Mr.
Williams
give
me
about
the
post
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
gardener
come
by
,
I
say
,
Mr.
Jacob
,
I
have
plant
a
few
bean
,
and
I
call
the
place
my
garden
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
just
by
the
door
out
<EOS>
yonder
:
<EOS>
I
will
shew
it
you
;
pray
do
not
dig
them
up
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
on
with
him
;
and
when
we
have
turn
the
alley
,
out
of
her
sight
and
be
near
the
place
say
I
,
<EOS>
pray
step
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
ask
her
if
she
have
any
more
bean
for
me
to
plant
?
 
<EOS>
He
smile
,
I
suppose
at
my
foolishness
;
and
I
pop
the
letter
under
the
mould
,
and
step
back
,
as
if
wait
for
his
return
;
which
,
be
near
,
be
immediate
;
and
she
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
what
should
I
do
with
bean
?
<EOS>
say
she
,
 
and
sadly
scare
me
;
for
she
whisper
me
,
I
be
afraid
of
some
fetch
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
use
to
send
on
such
simple
errand
.
 
<EOS>
what
fetch
?
<EOS>
say
I
:
<EOS>
It
be
hard
I
can
neither
stir
,
nor
speak
,
but
I
must
be
suspect
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
my
master
write
,
that
I
must
have
all
my
eye
about
me
;
for
though
you
be
as
innocent
as
a
dove
,
yet
you
be
as
cunning
as
a
serpent
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
forgive
you
,
if
you
cheat
me
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
think
of
my
money
,
and
could
have
call
her
name
<EOS>
,
have
I
dare
:
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
Pray
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
now
you
talk
of
forgive
me
,
if
I
cheat
you
,
be
so
kind
as
to
pay
me
my
money
;
for
though
I
have
no
occasion
for
it
,
<EOS>
yet
I
know
you
be
but
in
jest
,
and
intend
to
give
it
me
again
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
it
in
a
proper
time
,
say
she
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
be
in
earnest
to
get
it
out
of
your
hand
,
for
fear
you
should
make
an
ill
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
cavil
upon
this
subject
as
we
walk
in
,
and
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
write
my
letter
to
my
master
;
and
,
as
I
intend
to
shew
it
her
<EOS>
,
I
resolve
to
write
accordingly
as
to
her
part
of
it
;
for
I
make
little
account
of
his
offer
of
Mrs.
Jervis
to
me
,
instead
of
this
wicked
woman
,
(
though
the
most
agreeable
thing
that
could
have
befall
me
,
except
my
escape
from
hence
,
)
nor
indeed
any
thing
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
for
to
be
honourable
,
in
the
just
sense
of
the
word
,
he
nee
not
have
cause
me
to
be
run
away
with
,
and
confine
as
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
as
follow
:
  
"
HONOURED
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
consider
how
easily
you
may
make
me
happy
,
since
all
I
desire
be
to
be
permit
to
go
to
my
poor
father
and
mother
;
when
I
reflect
upon
your
former
proposal
to
me
in
relation
to
a
certain
person
,
not
one
word
of
which
be
now
mention
;
and
upon
my
being
in
that
strange
manner
run
away
with
,
and
still
keep
here
a
miserable
prisoner
;
do
you
think
,
sir
,
(
pardon
your
poor
servant
's
freedom
;
my
fear
make
me
bold
;
do
you
think
,
I
say
,
)
that
your
general
assurance
of
honour
to
me
,
can
have
the
effect
upon
me
,
that
,
be
it
not
for
these
thing
,
all
your
word
ought
to
have
?
 
<EOS>
o
,
good
sir
!
<EOS>
I
too
much
apprehend
that
your
notion
of
honour
and
mine
be
very
different
from
one
another
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
no
other
hope
<EOS>
but
in
your
continue
absence
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
proposal
to
make
me
,
that
be
consistent
with
your
honourable
profession
,
in
my
humble
sense
of
the
word
,
a
few
line
will
communicate
them
to
me
,
and
I
will
return
such
an
answer
as
befit
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
<EOS>
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
proposal
can
one
in
your
high
station
have
to
make
to
one
in
my
low
one
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
belong
to
your
degree
too
well
,
to
imagine
,
that
any
thing
can
be
expect
but
sad
temptation
,
and
utter
distress
,
if
you
come
down
;
and
you
know
not
,
sir
,
when
I
be
make
desperate
,
what
the
wretched
Pamela
dare
to
do
!
  
<EOS>
"
whatever
rashness
you
may
impute
to
me
,
I
can
not
help
it
;
but
I
wish
I
may
not
be
force
upon
any
,
that
otherwise
would
never
enter
into
my
thought
.
 
<EOS>
forgive
me
,
sir
,
my
plainness
;
I
should
be
loath
to
behave
to
my
master
unbecomingly
;
but
I
must
needs
say
,
sir
,
<EOS>
my
innocence
be
so
dear
to
me
,
that
all
other
consideration
be
,
and
,
I
hope
,
shall
ever
be
,
treat
by
me
as
nicety
,
that
ought
,
for
that
,
to
be
dispense
with
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
mean
honourably
,
why
,
sir
,
should
you
not
let
me
know
it
plainly
?
 
<EOS>
why
be
it
necessary
to
imprison
me
,
to
convince
me
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
why
must
I
be
close
watch
,
and
attend
,
hinder
from
stir
out
,
from
speak
to
any
body
,
from
go
so
much
as
to
church
to
pray
for
you
,
who
have
be
,
till
of
late
,
so
generous
a
benefactor
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
I
humbly
ask
,
why
all
this
,
if
you
mean
honourably
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
me
to
expostulate
so
freely
,
but
in
a
case
so
near
to
me
,
with
you
,
sir
,
so
greatly
my
superior
.
 
<EOS>
pardon
me
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
;
but
as
to
see
you
,
I
can
not
bear
the
dreadful
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
you
have
to
propose
,
whatever
you
intend
by
me
,
let
my
assent
be
that
of
a
free
person
,
mean
as
I
be
,
and
not
of
a
sordid
slave
,
who
be
to
be
threaten
and
frighten
into
a
compliance
with
measure
,
which
your
conduct
to
her
seem
to
imply
would
be
otherwise
abhor
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
restraint
be
indeed
hard
upon
me
:
I
be
very
uneasy
under
it
.
 
<EOS>
shorten
it
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
,
or
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
dare
to
say
more
,
than
that
I
be
                              
<EOS>
"
Your
greatly
oppress
unhappy
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
after
I
have
take
a
copy
of
this
,
I
fold
it
up
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
come
just
as
I
have
do
,
sit
down
by
me
;
and
say
,
when
she
see
me
direct
it
,
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
if
you
have
take
my
advice
,
and
consent
to
my
master
be
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
will
oblige
you
,
say
I
,
I
will
read
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
good
,
say
she
;
then
I
will
love
you
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
then
you
must
not
offer
to
alter
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
,
reply
she
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
read
it
to
her
,
and
she
praise
me
much
for
my
wording
it
;
but
say
she
think
I
push
the
matter
very
close
;
and
it
would
better
bear
talk
of
,
than
write
about
.
 
<EOS>
She
want
an
explanation
or
two
,
as
about
the
proposal
to
a
certain
person
;
but
I
say
,
she
must
take
it
as
she
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
you
understand
one
another
,
and
will
do
so
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
seal
up
the
letter
,
and
she
undertake
to
convey
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
know
it
in
vain
to
expect
to
have
leave
to
go
to
church
now
,
and
so
I
do
not
ask
;
and
<EOS>
I
be
the
more
indifferent
,
because
,
if
I
may
have
have
permission
,
the
sight
of
the
neighbour
gentry
,
who
have
despise
my
suffering
,
would
have
give
me
great
regret
and
sorrow
;
and
it
be
impossible
I
should
have
edify
under
any
doctrine
preach
by
Mr.
Peters
:
<EOS>
so
I
apply
myself
to
my
private
devotion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
come
yesterday
,
and
this
day
,
as
usual
,
and
take
my
letter
;
but
,
have
no
good
opportunity
,
we
avoid
one
another
's
conversation
,
and
keep
at
a
distance
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
concern
I
have
not
the
key
;
for
I
would
not
have
lose
a
moment
in
that
case
,
have
I
be
he
,
and
he
I.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
at
my
devotion
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
up
,
and
want
me
sadly
to
sing
her
a
psalm
,
as
she
have
often
on
common
day
importune
me
for
a
song
upon
the
spinnet
:
<EOS>
but
I
decline
it
,
because
my
spirit
be
so
low
I
could
hardly
speak
,
nor
care
to
be
speak
to
;
but
when
she
be
go
,
I
remember
the
cxxxviith
psalm
to
be
a
little
touching
,
turn
to
it
,
and
take
the
liberty
to
alter
it
,
somewhat
near
to
my
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
do
not
sin
in
it
;
but
thus
I
turn
it
:
                
I.
    
<EOS>
when
sad
I
sit
in
B####n
Hall
,
    
all
guard
round
about
,
  
and
thought
of
ev'ry
absent
friend

the
tear
for
grief
burst
out

<EOS>
II

<EOS>
My

all

<EOS>
My

unfit
my

for

much
more
to
bear
a
joke

<EOS>
III
.
    
<EOS>
then
she
to
whom
I
pris'ner
be

say
to
me
,
tauntingly
,
  
<EOS>
now
cheer
your

to
joy

<EOS>
Alas

<EOS>
say
I

how
can
I
frame
    
<EOS>
My
heavy
heart
to
sing

or
tune
my

,
while
thus
enthrall'd
    
<EOS>
by
such
a
wicked
thing

<EOS>
V.
    
<EOS>
but
yet
,
if
from
my
innocence
    
I
,
ev'n
in

should
slide

<EOS>
then
let
my

quite

the
sweet
spinnet
to

<EOS>
and
let

be

Wednesday

<EOS>
I
write
now
with
a
little
more
liking
,
though
less
opportunity
,
because
Mr.
Williams
have
get
a
large
parcel
of
my
paper
,
safe
in
his
hand
,
to
send
them
to
you
,
as
he
have
opportunity
;
so
I
be
not
quite
uselessly
employ
:
and
I
be
deliver
besides
,
from
the
fear
of
their
be
find
,
if
I
should
be
search
,
or
discover
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
permit
to
take
an
airing
,
five
or
six
mile
,
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
<EOS>
but
,
though
I
know
not
the
reason
,
she
watch
me
more
closely
than
ever
;
so
that
we
have
discontinue
,
by
consent
,
for
these
three
day
,
the
sunflow
correspondence
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
cook
-
maid
have
have
a
bad
mischance
;
for
she
have
be
hurt
much
by
a
bull
in
the
pasture
,
by
the
side
of
the
garden
,
not
far
from
the
back
-
door
.
<EOS>
now
this
pasture
I
be
to
cross
,
which
be
about
half
a
mile
,
and
then
be
a
common
,
and
near
that
a
private
horse
-
road
,
where
I
hope
to
find
an
opportunity
for
escaping
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Williams
can
get
me
a
horse
,
and
have
make
all
ready
for
me
:
for
he
have
get
me
the
key
,
which
he
put
under
the
mould
,
just
by
the
door
,
as
he
find
an
opportunity
to
hint
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
just
now
have
signify
,
that
the
gentleman
be
dead
,
whose
living
he
have
have
hope
of
;
and
he
come
pretendedly
to
tell
Mrs.
Jewkes
of
it
;
and
so
could
speak
this
to
her
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
wish
him
joy
.
 
<EOS>
see
what
the
world
be
!
 
<EOS>
one
man
's
death
be
another
man
's
joy
.
 
<EOS>
thus
we
thrust
out
one
another
!
 
<EOS>
My
hard
case
make
me
serious
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
mean
to
slide
a
letter
into
my
hand
,
and
be
go
away
<EOS>
:
He
look
at
me
with
such
respect
and
solemness
at
parting
,
that
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
why
,
madam
,
I
believe
our
young
parson
be
half
in
love
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
he
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
,
(
I
believe
to
sound
me
,
)
<EOS>
why
,
I
can
not
see
you
can
either
of
you
do
better
;
and
I
have
lately
be
so
touched
for
you
,
see
how
heavily
you
apprehend
dishonour
from
my
master
<EOS>
,
that
I
think
it
be
pity
you
should
not
have
Mr.
Williams
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
this
must
be
a
fetch
of
hers
;
because
,
instead
of
be
troubled
for
me
,
as
she
pretend
,
she
watch
me
closer
,
and
him
too
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
say
,
there
be
not
the
man
live
that
I
desire
to
marry
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
can
but
keep
myself
honest
,
it
be
all
my
desire
:
<EOS>
and
to
be
a
comfort
and
assistance
to
my
poor
parent
,
if
it
should
be
my
happy
lot
to
be
so
,
be
the
very
top
of
my
ambition
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
say
she
,
I
have
be
think
very
seriously
,
that
Mr.
Williams
would
make
you
a
good
husband
;
and
as
he
will
owe
all
his
fortune
to
my
master
,
he
will
be
very
glad
,
to
be
sure
,
to
be
oblige
to
him
for
a
wife
of
his
choosing
:
<EOS>
especially
,
say
she
,
such
a
pretty
one
,
and
one
so
ingenious
,
and
genteelly
educate
.
  
<EOS>
this
give
me
a
doubt
,
whether
she
know
of
my
master
's
intimation
of
that
sort
formerly
;
and
I
ask
her
,
if
she
have
reason
to
surmise
that
that
be
in
view
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
she
say
;
<EOS>
it
be
only
her
own
thought
;
but
it
be
very
likely
that
my
master
have
either
that
in
view
,
or
something
well
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
approve
of
it
,
she
would
propose
such
a
thing
to
her
master
directly
;
and
give
a
detestable
hint
,
that
I
may
take
resolution
upon
it
,
of
bring
such
an
affair
to
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
I
abhor
her
vile
insinuation
;
and
as
to
Mr.
Williams
,
I
think
him
a
civil
good
sort
of
man
;
but
,
as
on
one
side
,
he
be
above
me
;
so
,
on
the
other
,
I
say
of
all
thing
I
do
not
love
a
parson
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
find
she
could
make
nothing
of
me
,
she
quit
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
open
his
letter
by
and
by
,
and
give
you
the
content
of
it
;
for
she
be
up
and
down
so
much
,
that
I
be
afraid
of
her
surprise
me
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
see
Providence
have
not
abandon
me
:
I
shall
be
under
no
necessity
to
make
advance
to
Mr.
Williams
,
if
I
be
(
as
I
be
sure
I
be
not
)
dispose
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
his
letter
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
to
express
myself
,
lest
I
should
appear
to
you
to
have
a
selfish
view
in
the
service
<EOS>
I
would
do
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
really
know
<EOS>
but
one
effectual
and
honourable
way
to
disengage
yourself
from
the
dangerous
situation
you
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
that
of
marriage
with
some
person
that
you
could
make
happy
in
your
approbation
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
my
own
part
,
it
would
be
,
as
thing
stand
,
my
apparent
ruin
;
and
,
bad
<EOS>
still
,
I
should
involve
you
in
misery
too
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
yet
,
so
great
be
my
veneration
for
you
,
and
so
entire
my
reliance
on
Providence
,
upon
so
just
an
occasion
,
that
I
should
think
myself
but
too
happy
,
if
I
may
be
accept
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
,
in
this
case
,
forego
all
my
expectation
,
and
be
your
conductor
to
some
safe
distance
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
say
,
in
this
case
?
 
<EOS>
that
I
will
do
,
whether
you
think
fit
to
reward
me
so
eminently
or
not
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
,
the
moment
I
hear
of
Mr.
B####"s
set
out
,
(
<EOS>
and
I
think
now
I
have
settle
a
very
good
method
of
intelligence
of
all
his
motion
,
)
get
a
horse
ready
,
and
myself
to
conduct
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
refer
myself
wholly
to
your
goodness
and
direction

I

more

after

I
have
no

I
would
marry

after
a

different

I
write

:
  
"
REVEREND
SIR

"
I
be
greatly
confused
at
the
content
of
your
last
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
much
too
generous
,
and
I
can
not
bear
you
should
risk
all
your
future
prospect
for
so
unworthy
a
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
of
your
offer
without
equal
concern
and
gratitude
:
<EOS>
for
nothing
,
but
to
avoid
my
utter
ruin
,
can
make
me
think
of
a
change
of
condition
;
and
so
,
sir
,
you
ought
not
to
accept
of
such
an
involuntary
compliance
,
as
mine
would
be
,
be
I
,
upon
the
last
necessity
,
to
yield
to
your
very
generous
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
rely
wholly
upon
your
goodness
to
me
,
in
assist
my
escape
;
but
shall
not
,
on
your
account
principally
,
think
of
the
honour
you
propose
for
me
at
present
;
and
never
,
but
at
the
pleasure
of
my
parent

who
,
poor

they

a
weighty

I
beg
you
,
therefore
,

not
to
think
of
any

from
me

everlasting

Mrs.

have
receive
a

much
civiller
to

I
wonder
I
have
not
one
in
answer
to
mine
to
my
master

<EOS>
I
suppose
I
put
the
matter
too
home
to
him

and
he
be
angry

<EOS>
I
be
not
the
more
pleased

for
she
be
horrid
cunne

I
lay
a

He

intimate

that
though
I

readily

his

he
will
leave

He

Mr.

come

both
together

then

sit
down

<EOS>
why

every

why

She

I
will
shew

they
be
bring

<EOS>
I
tremble
at
the
thought
of
what
this
may
mean
;
and
say
,
You
have
so
surprised
me
,
that
I
can
not
stand

<EOS>
why
do
you
come
up

such
a
manner

attack
such
weak
spirit

<EOS>
say
he
,
to
Mrs.

Shall
we
leave

My

be
quite
sick

the
surprise

so
that
I
could
not
presently
read
them
,
notwithstanding
my
impatience
;
but
,
after
a
while
,
recover
,
I
find
the
content
thus
strange
and
unexpected
:

the
death
of
Mr.

have
now
give

that
in

double
respect

for
I
shall
soon
put

,
if
you
have
the
art

make
yourself
well
receive

one
of
the
lovely
wife
in
England

<EOS>
She
have
not
be
use
(
as
she
have
reason
to
think
)
accord
to
her
merit
;
but
when
she
find
herself
under
the
protection
of
a
man
of
virtue
and
probity
,
and
a
happy
competency
to
support
life
in
the
manner
to
which
she
have
be
of
late
year
accustom

I
be
persuade
she
will
forgive
those
seeming
hardship
which
have
pave
the
way
to
so
happy
a
lot

as
I
hope
it
will
be
to
you
both

have
only
to
account
for
and
excuse
the
odd
conduct
I
have
be
guilty
of
,
which
I
shall
do
when
I
see
you
:

as
I
shall
soon
set
out
for
London

I
believe
it
will
not
be
yet
this
month

you
can
prevail

you

not

your

only
let
me
have
notice
of
it
first
,
and
that
she
approve
of
it
;
which
ought
to
be
,
in
so
material
a
point
,
entirely
at
her
option

as
I
assure
you

on
the

diligent

for
reason
I
shall
hereafter
explain

I
have
impose
upon
you

<EOS>
Your
trouble
be
now
almost
at
an
end
;
for
I
have
write
my
intention
to
Mr.
Williams
so
particularly
,
<EOS>
that
I
need
say
the
less
here
,
because
he
will
not
scruple
,
I
believe
,
to
let
you
know
the
content
of
my
letter

<EOS>
I
have
only
one
thing
to
mention
,
that
if
you
find
what
I
have
hint
to
him
in
the
least
measure
disagreeable
to
either

you
assure

both

that

you
continue

uneasy

hardly

transcribe

though
,
write
so
much
,
I
write
pretty
fast

before
they
both
come
up
again
in
high
spirit

and
Mr.
Williams
say
,
I
be
glad
at
my
heart

madam

that
I
be
beforehand
in
my
declaration

you
may
be

that
if
I
can
procure
this
fair
one

consent

still
mistrustful

never

like
in

life

but
I
see
,
say
she
,
I
be
not
wrong
,
while
my
old
order
last
,
to
be
wary
of
you
both
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
have
a
hard
task
to
prevent
you
,
I
find
;
for
,
as
the
saying
be

Nought
can
restrain
consent
of
twain

I
doubt
not
her
take
hold

indiscretion

take
her
letter

say
,
here

be
yours

I
thank
you
for
it
;
but
I
have
be
so
long
in

maze

that
I
can
say
nothing
of
this
for
the
present

will
bring
all
to

here

joy

will
be
die

say

not

without
you

<EOS>
Forbear
,

say
I
;
while
I
have
a
father
and
mother
,
I
be
not
my
own
mistress
,
poor
as
they
be

and
I
will
see
myself
quite
at
liberty

shall

hold
up

eye

such
art

such
caution

such
cunning
,
for
thy
year
!
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
(
that
he
may
be
more
on
his
guard
,
though
I
hope
there
can
not
be
deceit
in
this
;
 
'
twould
be
strange
villany
,
and
that
be
a
hard
word
,
if
there
should
!
)
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
use
to
be
make
a
fool
of
by
fortune
,
that
I
hardly
can
tell
how
to
govern
myself
;
and
be
almost
an
infidel
as
to
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
I
may
be
wrong
;
henceforth
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
you
shall
regulate
my
opinion
as
you
please
,
and
I
will
consult
you
in
every
thing
(
that
I
think
proper
,
<EOS>
say
I
to
myself
)
 
<EOS>
for
,
to
be
sure
,
though
I
may
forgive
her
,
I
can
never
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
leave
Mr.
Williams
and
me
,
a
few
minute
,
together
;
and
I
say
,
consider
,
sir
,
consider
what
you
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
impossible
,
say
he
,
there
can
be
deceit
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
,
say
I
;
but
what
necessity
be
there
for
you
to
talk
of
your
former
declaration
?
 
<EOS>
let
this
be
as
it
will
,
that
could
do
no
good
,
especially
before
this
woman
.
 
<EOS>
forgive
me
,
sir
;
they
talk
of
woman
's
promptness
of
speech
;
but
,
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
see
an
honest
heart
be
not
always
to
be
trust
with
itself
in
bad
company
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
reply
,
but
though
her
task
be
say
to
be
almost
<EOS>
(
I
take
notice
of
that
word
)
at
an
end
,
she
come
up
to
us
again
,
and
say
;
<EOS>
well
,
I
have
a
good
mind
to
show
you
the
way
to
church
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
this
,
because
,
though
in
my
present
doubtful
situation
I
should
not
have
choose
it
,
yet
I
would
have
encourage
her
proposal
,
to
be
able
to
judge
by
her
be
in
earnest
or
otherwise
,
whether
one
may
depend
upon
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Williams
again
indiscreetly
help
her
to
an
excuse
,
by
say
,
that
it
be
now
good
to
defer
it
one
Sunday
,
and
till
matter
be
ripe
for
my
appearance
:
and
she
readily
take
hold
of
it
,
and
confirm
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
hope
the
good
:
but
if
this
should
turn
out
to
be
a
plot
,
I
fear
nothing
but
a
miracle
can
save
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sure
the
heart
of
man
be
not
capable
of
such
black
deceit
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
Mr.
Williams
have
it
under
his
own
hand
,
and
he
dare
not
but
be
in
earnest
:
and
then
again
,
though
to
be
sure
he
have
be
very
wrong
to
me
,
yet
his
education
,
and
parent
'
example
,
have
neither
of
them
teach
him
such
very
black
contrivance
.
<EOS>
so
I
will
hope
for
the
good
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
I
,
have
be
all
three
walk
together
in
the
garden
;
and
she
pull
out
her
key
,
and
we
walk
a
little
in
the
pasture
to
look
at
the
bull
,
an
ugly
,
grim
,
surly
creature
,
that
hurt
the
poor
cook
-
maid
;
who
be
get
pretty
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
point
at
the
sunflower
,
but
I
be
force
to
be
very
reserved

<EOS>
I
tell

,
I
be
resolve

I
have
talk

<EOS>
She

,

<EOS>
I

as
I
could

very
safely
,
that
there

and
as

he
may
do
better
by
far
:
and
I
have
propose
so
much
happiness
in

<EOS>
all
these

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
but
pray
do

for

too
heady

in

<EOS>
to

<EOS>
and
I
find

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
wicked
brute
fall
a
laughing
,
when
she
have
read
this
letter
,
till
her
fat
side
shake
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
I
can
but
think
how
the
poor
parson
look
,
after
part
with
his
pretty
mistress
in
such
high
spirit
,
when
he
find
himself
at
the
bottom
of
the
dam
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
a
figure
he
must
cut
in
his
tattere
band
and
cassock
,
and
without
a
hat
and
wig
,
when
he
get
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
warrant
,
add
she
<EOS>
,
he
be
in
a
sweet
pickle
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
very
barbarous
to
laugh
at
such
a
misfortune
;
but
she
reply
,
as
he
be
safe
,
she
laugh
;
otherwise
she
would
have
be
sorry
:
and
she
be
glad
to
see
me
so
concerned
for
him
 
<EOS>
It
look
promising
,
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
I
heed
not
her
reflection
;
but
as
I
have
be
use
to
cause
for
mistrust
,
I
can
not
help
say
,
that
I
do
not
like
this
thing
:
and
their
take
his
letter
most
alarm
me
.
 
<EOS>
how
happy
it
be
they
miss
my
packet
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
think
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
but
why
should
I
let
every
accident
break
my
peace
?
 
<EOS>
yet
it
will
do
so
,
while
I
stay
here
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
mightily
at
me
,
to
go
with
her
in
the
chariot
,
to
visit
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
officious
to
bring
on
the
affair
between
us
,
<EOS>
that
,
be
a
cunning
,
artful
woman
,
I
know
not
what
to
make
of
it
:
I
have
refuse
her
absolutely
;
urge
,
that
except
I
intend
to
encourage
his
suit
,
I
ought
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
go
without
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
strange
temptation
to
get
away
in
her
absence
,
for
all
these
fine
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
sad
to
have
nobody
to
advise
with
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
money
,
if
I
should
,
to
buy
any
body
's
civility
,
or
to
pay
for
necessary
or
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
go
into
the
garden
,
and
resolve
afterwards
     
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
the
garden
,
and
to
the
back
-
door
:
<EOS>
and
there
I
stand
,
my
heart
up
at
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
I
be
watch
;
so
this
look
well
.
<EOS>
but
if
any
thing
should
go
bad
afterwards
,
I
should
never
forgive
myself
,
for
not
take
this
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
go
down
again
,
and
see
if
all
be
clear
,
and
how
it
look
out
at
the
back
-
door
in
the
pasture
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
there
be
witchcraft
in
this
house
;
and
I
believe
Lucifer
be
bribe
,
as
well
as
all
about
me
,
and
be
get
into
the
shape
of
that
nasty
grim
bull
to
watch
me
!
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
be
again
,
and
venture
to
open
the
door
,
and
go
out
about
a
bow
-
shot
into
the
pasture
;
but
there
stand
that
horrid
bull
,
stare
me
full
in
the
face
,
with
fiery
saucer
eye
,
as
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
get
in
again
,
<EOS>
for
fear
he
should
come
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
see
me
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
there
be
such
thing
as
witch
and
spirit
?
<EOS>
if
there
be
,
I
believe
,
in
my
heart
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
get
this
bull
of
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
what
could
I
do
without
money
,
or
a
friend
"
 
<EOS>
o
 
this
wicked
woman
!
<EOS>
to
trick
me
so
!
 
<EOS>
every
thing
,
man
,
woman
,
and
beast
,
be
in
a
plot
against
your
poor
Pamela
,
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
then
I
know
not
one
step
of
the
way
,
nor
how
far
to
any
house
or
cottage
;
and
whether
I
could
gain
protection
,
if
I
get
to
a
house
:
<EOS>
and
now
the
robber
be
abroad
too
<EOS>
,
I
may
run
into
as
great
danger
as
I
want
to
escape
;
nay
,
great
much
,
if
these
promising
appearance
hold
:
<EOS>
and
sure
my
master
can
not
be
so
black
as
that
they
should
not
!
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
try
for
it
once
more
;
but
then
I
may
be
pursue
and
take
:
and
it
will
be
bad
for
me
;
and
this
wicked
woman
will
beat
me
,
and
take
my
shoe
away
,
and
lock
me
up
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
if
my
master
should
mean
well
,
he
can
not
be
angry
at
my
fear
,
if
I
should
escape
;
and
nobody
can
blame
me
;
and
I
can
more
easily
be
induce
,
with
you
,
when
all
my
apprehension
be
over
,
to
consider
his
proposal
of
Mr.
Williams
,
than
I
could
here
;
and
he
pretend
,
as
you
have
read
in
his
letter
,
he
will
leave
me
to
my
choice
:
why
then
should
I
be
afraid
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
down
again
,
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
but
yet
my
heart
misgive
me
,
because
of
the
difficulty
before
me
,
in
escape
;
and
be
so
poor
and
so
friendless
!
 
<EOS>
o
good
God
!
<EOS>
the
preserver
of
the
innocent
!
<EOS>
direct
me
what
to
do
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
have
just
now
a
sort
of
strange
persuasion
upon
me
,
that
I
ought
to
try
to
get
way
,
and
leave
the
issue
to
Providence
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
once
more
 
I
will
see
,
at
least
,
if
this
bull
be
still
there
.
  
<EOS>
Alack
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
what
a
fate
be
this
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
courage
to
go
,
neither
<EOS>
can
I
think
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
the
gardener
be
in
sight
last
time
;
so
make
me
come
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
contrive
to
send
him
out
of
the
way
,
if
I
can
:
 
<EOS>
for
if
I
never
should
have
such
another
opportunity
,
I
could
not
forgive
myself
.
 
<EOS>
once
more
I
will
venture
.
 
<EOS>
God
direct
my
footstep
,
and
make
smooth
my
path
and
my
way
to
safety
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
here
I
be
,
come
back
again
!
<EOS>
frightened
,
like
a
fool
,
out
of
all
my
purpose
!
 
<EOS>
o
how
terrible
every
thing
appear
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
twice
as
far
again
,
as
I
be
before
,
out
of
the
back
-
door
:
and
I
look
and
see
the
bull
,
as
I
think
,
between
me
and
the
door
;
and
another
bull
come
towards
me
the
other
way
<EOS>
:
well
,
think
I
,
here
be
double
witchcraft
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
the
spirit
of
my
master
in
one
bull
,
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
go
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
o
help
!
<EOS>
cry
I
,
like
a
fool
,
and
run
back
to
the
door
,
as
swift
as
if
I
fly
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
get
the
door
in
my
hand
,
I
venture
to
look
back
,
to
see
if
these
suppose
bull
be
come
;
and
I
see
they
be
only
two
poor
cow
,
a
grazing
in
distant
place
,
that
my
fear
have
make
all
this
rout
about
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
every
thing
be
so
frightful
to
me
,
I
find
I
be
not
fit
to
think
of
my
escape
:
for
I
shall
be
as
much
frightened
at
the
first
strange
man
that
I
meet
with
:
and
I
be
persuade
that
fear
bring
one
into
more
danger
,
than
the
caution
,
that
go
along
with
it
,
deliver
one
from
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
lock
the
door
,
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
,
and
be
in
a
sad
quandary
;
but
I
be
soon
determine
;
for
the
maid
Nan
come
in
sight
,
and
ask
,
if
any
thing
be
the
matter
,
that
I
be
so
often
up
and
down
stair
?
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
,
(
but
I
have
a
sad
lie
at
my
tongue
's
end
,
)
<EOS>
say
I
;
Though
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
sometimes
a
little
hard
upon
me
,
yet
I
know
not
where
I
be
without
her
:
I
go
up
,
and
I
come
down
to
walk
about
in
the
garden
;
and
,
not
have
her
,
know
scarcely
what
to
do
with
myself
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
the
ideot
,
she
be
main
good
company
,
madam
,
no
wonder
you
miss
her
.
  
<EOS>
so
here
I
be
again
,
and
here
likely
to
be
;
for
I
have
no
courage
to
help
myself
any
where
else
.
 
<EOS>
o
why
be
poor
foolish
maiden
try
with
such
danger
,
when
they
have
such
weak
mind
to
grapple
with
them
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
since
it
be
so
,
hope
the
good
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
can
not
but
observe
how
grievously
every
thing
make
against
me
:
for
here
be
the
robber
;
though
I
fall
not
into
their
hand
myself
,
yet
they
give
me
as
much
terror
,
and
have
as
great
an
effect
upon
my
fear
,
as
if
I
have
:
<EOS>
and
here
be
the
bull
;
it
have
as
effectually
frighten
me
,
as
if
I
have
be
hurt
by
it
instead
of
the
cook
-
maid
;
and
so
these
join
together
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
make
a
very
dastard
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
folly
be
the
bad
of
all
,
because
that
deprive
me
of
my
money
:
for
have
I
have
that
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
should
have
venture
both
the
bull
and
the
robber
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
return
from
her
visit
:
well
,
say
she
,
I
would
have
you
set
your
heart
at
rest
;
for
Mr.
Williams
will
do
very
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
half
so
bad
as
he
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
o
these
scholar
<EOS>
,
say
she
,
they
have
not
the
heart
of
mouse
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
only
a
few
scratch
on
his
face
;
which
,
say
she
,
I
suppose
he
get
by
grapple
among
the
gravel
at
the
bottom
of
the
dam
,
to
try
to
find
a
hole
in
the
ground
,
to
hide
himself
from
the
robber
.
 
<EOS>
His
shin
and
his
knee
be
hardly
to
be
see
to
ail
any
thing
.
<EOS>
He
say
in
his
letter
,
he
be
a
frightful
spectacle
:
<EOS>
He
may
be
so
,
indeed
,
when
he
first
come
in
a
door
;
but
he
look
well
enough
now
:
and
,
only
for
a
few
groan
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
he
think
of
his
danger
,
I
see
nothing
be
the
matter
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
say
she
,
I
would
have
you
be
very
easy
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
,
say
I
,
for
all
your
joke
,
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
he
talk
of
nothing
<EOS>
but
you
:
and
when
I
tell
him
I
would
fain
have
persuade
you
to
come
with
me
,
the
man
be
out
of
his
wit
with
his
gratitude
to
me
:
and
so
have
lay
open
all
his
heart
to
me
,
and
tell
me
all
that
have
pass
,
and
be
contrive
between
you
two
.
 
<EOS>
this
alarm
me
prodigiously
;
and
the
rather
,
as
I
see
,
by
two
or
three
instance
,
that
his
honest
heart
could
keep
nothing
,
believe
every
one
as
undesigning
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
<EOS>
but
yet
with
a
heavy
heart
,
ah
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
this
may
have
do
with
me
,
have
he
have
any
thing
that
he
could
have
tell
you
of
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
know
well
enough
,
that
have
we
be
dispose
,
we
have
no
opportunity
for
it
,
from
your
watchful
care
and
circumspection
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
,
that
be
very
true
,
Mrs.
Pamela
;
not
so
much
as
for
that
declaration
that
he
own
before
me
<EOS>
,
he
have
find
opportunity
,
for
all
my
watchfulness
,
to
make
you
.
 
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
say
she
,
no
more
of
these
sham
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
an
excellent
head
-
piece
for
your
year
;
but
may
be
I
be
as
cunning
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
all
be
well
now
;
because
my
watchment
be
now
over
,
by
my
master
's
direction
.
<EOS>
how
have
you
employ
yourself
in
my
absence
?
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
troubled
at
what
may
have
pass
between
Mr.
Williams
and
her
,
that
I
could
not
hide
it
;
and
she
say
,
well
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
since
all
matter
be
likely
to
be
so
soon
<EOS>
and
so
happily
ended
,
<EOS>
let
me
advise
you
to
be
a
little
less
concerned
at
his
discovery
;
and
make
me
your
confidant
,
as
he
have
do
,
and
I
shall
think
you
have
some
favour
for
me
,
and
reliance
upon
me
;
and
perhaps
you
may
not
repent
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
so
earnest
,
that
I
mistrust
she
do
this
to
pump
me
;
and
I
know
how
,
now
,
to
account
for
her
kindness
to
Mr.
Williams
in
her
visit
to
him
;
which
be
only
to
get
out
of
him
what
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
be
all
this
fishing
about
for
something
,
where
there
be
nothing
,
if
there
be
an
end
of
your
watchment
,
as
you
call
them
?
 
<EOS>
nothing
,
say
she
,
but
<EOS>
womanish
curiosity
,
I
will
assure
you
;
for
one
be
naturally
lead
to
find
out
matter
,
where
there
be
such
privacy
intend
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
pray
let
me
know
what
he
have
say
;
and
then
I
will
give
you
an
answer
to
your
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
,
say
she
,
whether
you
do
or
not
for
I
have
as
much
as
I
want
from
him
;
and
I
despair
of
get
out
of
you
any
thing
you
ha'n't
a
mind
I
should
know
,
<EOS>
my
little
cunning
dear
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
let
him
have
say
what
he
would
,
I
care
not
:
for
I
be
sure
he
can
say
no
harm
of
me
;
and
so
let
us
change
the
talk
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
the
easy
,
indeed
,
because
,
for
all
her
pump
,
she
give
no
hint
of
the
key
and
the
door
,
etc
.
<EOS>
which
,
have
he
communicate
to
her
,
she
would
not
have
forborne
give
me
a
touch
of
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
give
up
one
another
,
as
despair
to
gain
our
end
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
he
must
have
say
more
than
he
should
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
the
more
apprehensive
<EOS>
all
be
not
right
,
because
she
have
now
be
actually
,
these
two
hour
,
shut
up
a
writing
;
though
she
pretend
she
have
give
me
up
all
her
store
of
paper
,
etc
.
<EOS>
and
that
I
should
write
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
wish
I
have
venture
every
thing
and
go
off
,
when
I
may
.
 
<EOS>
o
when
will
this
state
of
doubt
and
uneasiness
end
!
  
<EOS>
She
have
just
be
with
me
,
and
say
she
shall
send
a
messenger
to
Bedfordshire
;
and
he
shall
carry
a
letter
of
thank
for
me
,
if
I
will
write
it
for
my
master
's
favour
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
say
I
,
I
have
no
thank
to
give
,
till
I
be
with
my
father
and
mother
:
and
besides
,
I
send
a
letter
,
as
you
know
;
but
have
have
no
answer
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
think
that
his
letter
to
Mr.
Williams
be
sufficient
;
and
the
least
I
could
do
be
to
thank
him
,
if
but
in
two
line
.
 
<EOS>
no
need
of
it
,
say
I
;
for
I
do
not
intend
to
have
Mr.
Williams
:
<EOS>
what
then
be
that
letter
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
I
see
thou
art
quite
unfathomable
!
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
o
my
foolish
fear
of
bull
and
robber
!
 
<EOS>
for
now
all
my
uneasiness
begin
to
double
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
o
what
have
this
incautious
man
say
!
 
<EOS>
that
,
no
doubt
,
be
the
subject
of
her
long
letter
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
close
this
day
's
writing
,
with
just
say
,
that
she
be
mighty
silent
and
reserve
,
to
what
she
be
:
and
say
nothing
but
no
,
or
<EOS>
yes
,
to
what
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
something
must
be
hatch
,
I
doubt
!
 
<EOS>
I
the
rather
think
so
,
because
I
find
she
do
not
keep
her
word
with
me
,
about
lie
by
myself
,
and
my
money
;
to
both
which
point
she
return
suspicious
answer
,
say
,
as
to
the
one
,
why
,
you
be
mighty
earnest
for
your
money
;
I
shall
not
run
away
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
the
other
,
good
-
lack
!
<EOS>
you
need
not
be
so
willing
,
as
I
know
of
,
to
part
with
me
for
a
bed
-
fellow
,
till
you
be
sure
of
one
you
like
better
.
 
<EOS>
this
cut
me
to
the
heart
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
stop
my
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
have
be
here
;
but
we
have
have
no
opportunity
to
talk
together
:
He
seem
confound
at
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
change
of
temper
,
and
reservedness
,
after
her
kind
visit
,
and
their
freedom
with
one
another
,
and
much
more
at
what
I
be
go
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
,
if
I
would
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
him
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
,
I
can
not
go
.
<EOS>
say
he
,
May
not
Mrs.
Pamela
take
a
walk
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
<EOS>
;
I
desire
she
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
?
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
have
somehow
disoblige
you
.
 
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
reply
she
;
but
I
suppose
you
will
soon
be
at
liberty
to
walk
together
as
much
as
you
please
:
and
I
have
send
a
messenger
for
my
last
instruction
,
about
this
and
more
weighty
matter
;
and
when
they
come
I
shall
leave
you
to
do
as
you
both
will
;
but
,
till
then
,
it
be
no
matter
how
little
you
be
together
.
 
<EOS>
this
alarm
us
both
;
and
<EOS>
he
seem
quite
strike
of
a
heap
,
and
put
on
,
as
I
think
,
a
self
-
accuse
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
behind
her
back
,
and
hold
my
two
hand
together
,
flat
,
with
a
bit
of
paper
,
I
have
,
between
them
,
and
look
at
him
:
and
he
seem
to
take
me
as
I
intend
;
intimate
the
renewing
of
the
correspondence
by
the
tile
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
them
both
together
,
and
retire
to
my
closet
to
write
a
letter
for
the
tile
;
but
have
no
time
for
a
copy
,
I
will
give
you
the
substance
only
.
  
<EOS>
I
expostulate
with
him
on
his
too
great
openness
and
easiness
to
fall
into
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
snare
:
tell
him
my
apprehension
of
foul
play
;
and
give
briefly
the
reason
which
move
me
:
beg
to
know
what
he
have
say
;
and
intimate
,
that
I
think
there
be
the
high
reason
to
resume
our
prospect
of
the
escape
by
the
back
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
this
in
the
usual
place
in
the
evening
;
and
now
wait
with
impatience
for
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
follow
answer
:
  
"
<EOS>
DEAREST
madam
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
utterly
confound
,
and
must
plead
guilty
to
all
your
just
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
master
of
all
but
half
your
caution
and
discretion
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
after
all
,
this
be
only
a
touch
of
this
ill
woman
's
temper
,
to
shew
her
power
and
importance
:
for
I
think
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
neither
can
nor
dare
deceive
me
in
so
black
a
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
expose
him
all
the
world
over
if
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
,
can
not
be
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
receive
a
letter
from
John
Arnold
,
in
which
he
tell
me
,
that
his
master
be
prepare
for
his
London
journey
;
and
believe
,
afterwards
,
he
will
come
into
these
part
:
<EOS>
but
he
say
,
Lady
Davers
be
at
their
house
,
and
be
to
accompany
her
brother
to
London
,
or
meet
him
there
,
he
know
not
which
.
<EOS>
He
profess
great
zeal
and
affection
to
your
service
:
and
I
find
he
refer
to
a
letter
he
send
me
before
,
but
which
be
not
come
to
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
can
be
no
treachery
;
for
it
be
a
particular
friend
at
Gainsborough
,
that
I
have
order
him
to
direct
to
;
and
this
be
come
safe
to

leisure

account

I
say
long
,
because
I
wonder
how
you
could
find
time

opportunity

them

otherwise
they
be
the
delight
of
our
spare
hour

we
shall
read
them
over

as
long

give

I

we

not

so
turn

turn

the
folly

injury

our

rather
must

violence

much
prudence

You
can
give
her
the
advice
she
have
so
much
want
,
and
still
want
,
and
will
always
want
:
You
can
confirm
her
in
the
path
of
virtue
,
into
which
you
first
initiate
her
;
and
you
can
pray
for
her
,
with
heart
so
sincere

pure
,
that
be
not
to
be
meet
with
in
palace

oh

how
I
long

myself
at

receive
from

blessing

good
parent

overcloud

trial

more
danger

I
fear

must
your
poor
Pamela
be
engage
in

through
the
Divine
goodness
,
and
your
prayer
,
I
hope
,
at
last
,
to
get
well
out
of
all
my
difficulty

and
the
rather
,
as
they
be
not
the
effect
of
my
own
vanity
or
presumption

I
will
proceed
with
my
hopeless
story

<EOS>
I
see
Mr.
Williams
be
a
little
nettle
at
my
impatience
;
and
so
I
write
to
assure
him
I
would
be
as
easy
as
I
could
,
and
wholly
direct
by
him
;
especially
as
my
father
,
whose
respect
I
mention
,
have
assure
me
my
master
be
set
out
for
London
,
which
he
must
have
somehow
from

own
family

would
not

word
of

have
be

be
very
indifferently

still

,
to
avoid
suspicion

I
leave
them
together

up

little

satisfied

mischief
brewing

shall
begin

hide

paper

be
circumspect

seem
mighty
impatient

an
answer
to
her
letter

master

<EOS>
Monday
,
Tuesday
,
the
25th
and
26th
day

my
heavy
restraint

more
strange
thing
to
write

now
all
be
out

<EOS>
what
,
at

will
become

<EOS>
such
strange
turn
and
trial
<EOS>
sure
never
poor

experience

<EOS>
He
bring
two
letter
,
one
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
one
to
me
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
great
wit
may
be
sometimes
mistaken
,
they
be
fold
and
seal
alike
,
that
for
me
be
direct
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
and
that
for
her
be
direct
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
both
be
stark
naught
,
abominably
bad
!
 
<EOS>
She
bring
me
up
<EOS>
that
direct
for
me
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
here
be
a
letter
for
you
:
long
-
look
-
for
be
come
at
last

<EOS>
I
will
ask
the
messenger
a
few
question
,
and
then
I
will
read
mine
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
go
down
,

I
break
it
open
in
my
closet

find
it
direct

it
begin

<EOS>
I
be
quite
confounded

but
,
think
I
<EOS>
,
this
may
be
a
lucky
mistake
;
I
may
discover
something
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
read
on
these
horrid
content
:
  
"

play

rather

<EOS>
I
have
but
just
read
this
dreadful
letter
through
,
when
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
up
in
a
great
fright
,
guess
at
the
mistake
,
and
that
I
have
her
letter
,
and
she
find
me
with
it
open
in
my
hand
,
just
sink
away
.
 
<EOS>
what
business
,
say
she
,
have
you
to
read
my
letter
?
<EOS>
and
snatch
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
say
she
,
look
upon
it
,
it
say
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
at
top
:
<EOS>
You
ought
,
in
manner
,
to
have
read
no

<EOS>
o
add
not

say
I
,
to
my
affliction

<EOS>
I
shall
be
soon
out
of
all
your
way

<EOS>
this
be
too
much
!
<EOS>
too
much
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
can
support
this
 
and
throw
myself
upon
the
couch
,
in
my
closet
,
and
weep
most
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
She
read
it
in
the
next
room
,
and
come
in
again
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
this
,
say
she
,
be
a
sad
letter
indeed
:
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
it
:
<EOS>
but
I
fear
you
would
carry
your
nicety
too
far
!
  
<EOS>
leave
me
,
leave
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
for
a

I
can
not

she

<EOS>
well

I
will
come
up
again
presently

find
you
better

<EOS>

here
,
take
your
own
letter
;
I
wish
you
well

this
be
a
sad
mistake

<EOS>
and
so
she
put
down
by
me
that
which
be

I
have
no

<EOS>
I
sit
ruminate
,
when
I
have
a
little
come
to
myself
,
upon
the
term
of
this
wicked

have
no

I
begin
to
think
whether
I
be
not
indeed
a
very
naughty
body

have
not
do
vile
thing
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
think
of
his
have
discover
poor
John
,

of
Sir
Simon

base
officiousness
,
in
tell
him
of
Mr.
Williams
,
with
what
he
have
resolve
against
him
in
revenge
for
his
goodness
to
me
,
I
be
quite
dispirited
;
and
yet
still
more
about
that
fearful
Colbrand
,
and
what
he
could
see
do
to
me
:
for
then
I
be
ready
to
gasp
for
breath
,
and
my
heart
quite
fail
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
how
dreadful
be
the
word
,
that
he
will
decide
my
fate
in
three
week
!
 
<EOS>
Gracious
Heaven
,
say
I
,
strike
me
dead
,
before
that
time
,
with
a
thunderbolt
,
or
provide
some
way
for
my
escape
these
threaten
mischief
!
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
,
if
I
sin
!
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
take
up
the
letter
direct
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
but
design
for
me
;
and
I
find
that
little
well
than
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
hard
term
it
contain
:
  
<EOS>
"
well
have
you
do

how
ill
I
have

have
vow

now

out

my

in

difference

make
me
stoop
to
a
meanness

now
I
despise
myself
for

you
could
enter
into
an
intrigue
with
a
man
you
never
know
till
within
these
few
day
past

resolve
to
run
away

your

break

henceforth

artful

forward

ungrateful

all

as
I

move
to

compassion

find
myself
now
entirely
in

that
it

not

provoke

I
say

It
be
now

in

will
resign
myself

you
see
how
this

draw
in

undone

if
you
will
believe
me

say
I
,
I
give
no
encouragement
to
what
he
propose
,
as
to
marriage
;
nor
would
he
have
propose
it
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
but
as
the
only
honourable
way
he
think
be
leave
to
save
me
:
and
his
principal
motive
to
it
at
all
,
be
virtue
and
compassion
to
one
in
distress
.
 
<EOS>
what
other
view
could
he
have
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
be
poor

friendless

<EOS>
all
I
beg
of
you
be
,
to
let
the
poor

have
notice
of
my

resentment
;
and
let
him
fly
the
country
,
and
not
be
throw
into
gaol
.
 
<EOS>
this
will
answer
my
master
's
end
as
well
;
for
it
will
as
effectually
hinder
him
from
assist
me
,
as
if
he
be
in
a
prison
.
  
<EOS>
ask
me
,
say
she
,
to
do
any
thing
that
be
in
my
power

consistent
with
my
duty

trust

I
will
do
it

for
I
be
sorry

you
both

,
to
be
sure
,
I
shall
keep
no
correspondence
with
him
,
nor
let
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
to
talk
of
a
duty
superior
to
that
she
mention
,
which
would
oblige
her
to
help
distressed
innocence
,
and
not
permit
her
to
go
the
length
enjoin
by
lawless
tyranny
;
but
she
plainly
bid
me
be
silent
on
that
head
:
for
it
be
in
vain
to
attempt
to
persuade
her
to
betray
her
trust
:
  
<EOS>
a
<EOS>
will
I
have
to
advise
you
,
say
she
,
be
to
be
easy
;
lay
aside
all
your
contrivance
and
art
to
get
away
,
and
make
me
your
friend
,
by
give
me
no
reason
to
suspect
you
;
for
I
glory
in
my
fidelity
to
my
master
:
<EOS>
and
you
have
both
practise
some
strange
sly
art
,
to
make
such
a
progress
as
he
have
own
there
be
between
you
,
so
seldom
as
I
think
you
see
one
another
;
and
I
must
be
more
circumspect
than
I
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
this
double
my
concern
;
for
I
now
apprehend
I
should
be
much
closer
watch
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
since
I
have
,
by
this
strange
accident
,
discover
my
hard
destiny
;
let
me
read
over
again
that
fearful
letter
of
yours
,
that
I
may
get
it
by
heart
,
and
with
it
feed
my
distress
,
and
make
calamity
familiar
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
say
she
,
let
me
read
yours
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
her
mine
,
and
she
lend
me
her
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
take
a
copy
of
it
,
with
her
leave
;
because
,
as
I
say
I
would
,
by
it
,
prepare
myself
for
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
do
,
I
pin
it
on
the
head
of
the
couch
:
<EOS>
this
,
say
I
,
be
the
use
I
shall
make
of
this
wretched
copy
of
your
letter
;
and
here
you
shall
always
find
it
wet
with
my
tear
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
she
would
go
down
to
order
supper
;
and
insist
upon
my
company
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
excuse
myself
;
but
she
begin
to
put
on
a
command
air
,
that
I
durst
not
oppose
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
go
down
,
she
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
present
me
to
the
most
hideous
monster
I
ever
see
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
here
,
Monsieur
Colbrand
,
say
she
,
here
be
your
pretty
ward
and
mine
;
let
us
try
to
make
her
time
with
us
easy

He
bow
,
and
put
on
his
foreign
grimace
,
and
seem
to
bless
himself
;
and
,
in
broken
English
,
tell
me
,
I
be
happy
in
de
affection
of
de
finest
gentleman
in
de
varld
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
frightened
,
and
ready
to
drop
down
;
and
I
will
describe
him
to
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
if
now
you
will
ever
see
this
:
<EOS>
and
you
shall
judge
if
I
have
not
reason
,
especially
not
know
he
be
to
be
there
,
and
be
apprise
,
as
I
be
,
of
his
hated
employment
,
to
watch
me
closer
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
giant
of
a
man
for
stature
;
tall
by
a
good
deal
than
Harry
Mowlidge
,
in
your
neighbourhood
,
and
large
boned
,
and
scraggy
;
and
have
a
hand
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
an
one
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
great
stare
eye
,
like
the
bull
's
that
frighten
me
so
;
vast
jaw
-
bone
stick
out
:
<EOS>
eyebrow
hang
over
his
eye
;
two
great
scar
upon
his
forehead
,
and
one
on
his
left
cheek
;
and
two
large
whisker
,
and
a
monstrous
wide
mouth
;
blubber
lip
;
long
yellow
tooth
,
and
a
hideous
grin
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
his
own
frightful
long
hair
,
tie
up
in
a
great
black
bag
;
a
black
crape
neckcloth
about
a
long
ugly
neck
:
and
his
throat
stick
out
like
a
wen
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
rest
,
he
be
dress
well
enough
,
and
have
a
sword
on
,
with
a
nasty
red
knot
to
it
;
leather
garter
,
buckle
below
his
knee
;
and
a
foot
 
near
as
long
as
my
arm
,
I
verily
think
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
fright
de
lady
;
and
offer
to
withdraw
;
but
she
bid
him
not
;
and
I
tell
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
as
she
know
I
have
be
cry
,
she
should
not
have
call
me
to
the
gentleman
without
let
me
know
he
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
soon
go
up
to
my
closet
;
for
my
heart
ache
all
the
time
I
be
at
table
,
not
be
able
to
look
upon
him
without
horror
;
and
this
brute
of
a
woman
,
though
she
see
my
distress
,
before
this
addition
to
it
,
no
doubt
do
it
on
purpose
to
strike
more
terror
into
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
it
have
its
effect
:
for
when
I
go
to
bed
,
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
hideous
person
,
and
my
master
's
more
hideous
action
:
and
think
them
too
well
pair
;
and
when
I
dropt
asleep
,
I
dream
they
be
both
come
to
my
bedside
,
with
the
bad
design
;
and
<EOS>
I
jump
out
of
my
bed
in
my
sleep
,
and
frighten
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
till
,
wake
with
the
terror
,
I
tell
her
my
dream
;
and
the
wicked
creature
only
laugh
,
and
say
,
all
I
fear
be
but
a
dream
,
as
well
as
that
;
and
when
it
be
over
,
and
I
be
well
awake
,
I
should
laugh
at
it
as
such
!
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
come
to
the
close
of
Wednesday
,
the
27th
day
of
my
distress
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Williams
be
actually
arrest
,
and
carry
away
to
Stamford
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
be
an
end
of
all
my
hope
from
him
,
poor
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
His
over
-
security
and
openness
have
ruin
us
both
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
but
too
well
convinced
,
that
we
ought
not
to
have
lose
a
moment
's
time
;
but
he
be
half
angry
,
and
think
me
too
impatient
;
and
then
his
fatal
confession
,
and
the
detestable
artifice
of
my
master
!
 
<EOS>
but
one
may
well
think
,
that
he
who
have
so
cunningly
,
and
so
wickedly
,
contrive
all
his
stratagem
hitherto
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
avoid
them
,
would
stick
at
nothing
to
complete
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
I
shall
soon
find
it
so
!
  
<EOS>
but
one
stratagem
I
have
just
invent
,
though
a
very
discouraging
one
to
think
of
;
because
I
have
neither
friend
nor
money
,
nor
know
one
step
of
the
way
,
if
I
be
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
bull
,
and
bear
,
and
lion
,
and
tiger
,
and
,
what
be
bad
,
false
,
treacherous
,
deceitful
man
,
stand
in
my
way
,
I
can
not
be
in
more
danger
than
I
be
;
and
I
depend
nothing
upon
his
three
week
:
for
how
do
I
know
,
now
he
be
in
such
a
passion
,
and
have
already
begin
his
vengeance
on
poor
Mr.
Williams
,
that
he
will
not
change
his
mind
,
and
come
down
to
Lincolnshire
before
he
go
to
London
?
  
<EOS>
My
stratagem
be
this
:
I
will
endeavour
to
get
Mrs.
Jewkes
to
go
to
bed
without
me
,
as
she
often
do
,
while
I
sit
lock
up
in
my
closet
:
and
as
she
sleep
very
sound
in
her
first
sleep
,
of
which
she
never
fail
to
give
notice
by
snore
,
if
I
can
but
then
get
out
between
the
two
bar
of
the
window
,
(
for
you
know
I
be
very
slender
,
and
I
find
I
can
get
my
head
through
,
)
<EOS>
then
I
can
drop
upon
the
lead
underneath
,
which
be
little
more
than
my
height
,
and
which
lead
be
over
a
little
summer
-
parlour
,
that
jut
out
towards
the
garden
;
and
as
I
be
light
,
I
can
easily
drop
from
them
;
for
they
be
not
high
from
the
ground
:
then
I
shall
be
in
the
garden
;
and
then
,
as
I
have
the
key
of
the
back
-
door
,
I
will
get
out
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
another
piece
of
cunne
still
:
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
succeed
to
me
my
dangerous
,
but
innocent
device
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
a
great
captain
,
who
,
be
in
danger
,
leap
overboard
into
the
sea
,
and
his
enemy
,
as
he
swam
,
shoot
at
him
with
bow
and
arrow
,
he
unloose
his
upper
garment
,
and
take
another
course
,
while
they
stick
that
full
of
their
dart
and
arrow
;
and
so
he
escape
,
and
live
to
triumph
over
them
all
.
<EOS>
so
what
will
I
do
,
but
strip
off
my
upper
petticoat
,
and
throw
it
into
the
pond
,
with
my
neckhandkerchief
!
 
<EOS>
for
to
be
sure
,
when
they
miss
me
,
they
will
go
to
the
pond
first
,
think
I
have
drown
myself
:
and
<EOS>
so
,
when
they
see
some
of
my
clothe
float
there
,
they
will
be
all
employ
in
drag
the
pond
,
which
be
a
very
large
one
;
and
as
I
shall
not
,
perhaps
,
be
miss
till
the
morning
,
this
will
give
me
opportunity
to
get
a
great
way
off
;
and
I
be
sure
I
will
run
for
it
when
I
be
out
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
trust
,
that
Providence
will
direct
my
step
to
some
good
place
of
safety
,
and
make
some
worthy
body
my
friend
;
for
sure
,
if
I
suffer
ever
so
,
I
can
not
be
in
more
danger
,
nor
in
bad
hand
,
than
where
I
be
;
and
with
such
avow
bad
design
.
  
<EOS>
o
my
dear
parent
!
<EOS>
do
not
be
frightened
when
you
come
to
read
this
!
 
<EOS>
but
all
will
be
over
before
you
can
see
it
;
and
so
God
direct
me
for
the
good
!
 
<EOS>
My
writing
,
for
fear
I
should
not
escape
,
I
will
bury
in
the
garden
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
I
shall
be
search
and
use
dreadfully
if
I
can
not
get
off
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
will
close
here
,
for
the
present
,
to
prepare
for
my
plot
.
 
<EOS>
Prosper
thou
,
O
gracious
Protector
of
oppress
innocence
!
<EOS>
this
last
effort
of
thy
poor
handmaid
!
<EOS>
that
I
may
escape
the
crafty
device
and
snare
that
have
begin
to
entangle
my
virtue
;
and
from
which
,
but
by
this
one
trial
,
I
see
no
way
of
escape
.
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
whatever
become
of
me
,
bless
my
dear
parent
,
and
protect
poor
Mr.
Williams
from
ruin
!
<EOS>
for
he
be
happy
before
he
know
me
.
  
<EOS>
just
now
,
just
now
!
<EOS>
I
hear
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
who
be
in
her
cup
,
own
to
the
horrid
Colbrand
,
that
the
robbing
of
poor
Mr.
Williams
be
a
contrivance
of
her
,
and
execute
by
the
groom
and
a
helper
,
in
order
to
seize
my
letter
upon
him
,
which
they
miss
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
now
both
laugh
at
the
dismal
story
,
which
they
little
think
I
overhear
 
<EOS>
o
how
my
heart
ache
!
<EOS>
for
what
be
not
such
wretch
capable
of
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
blame
me
for
endeavour
,
through
any
danger
,
to
get
out
of
such
clutch
?
  
<EOS>
past
eleven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
come
up
,
and
go
to
bed
;
and
bid
me
not
stay
long
in
my
closet
,
but
come
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
o
for
a
dead
sleep
for
the
treacherous
brute
!
<EOS>
I
never
see
her
so
tipsy
,
and
that
give
me
hope
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
try
again
,
and
find
I
can
get
my
head
through
the
iron
bar
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
now
all
prepared
,
as
soon
as
I
hear
her
fast
;
and
now
I
will
seal
up
these
,
and
my
other
paper
,
my
last
work
:
and
to
thy
providence
,
o
my
gracious
God
!
<EOS>
commit
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
once
more
,
God
bless
you
both
!
<EOS>
and
send
us
a
happy
meeting
;
if
not
here
,
in
his
heavenly
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
amen
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
,
Friday
,
Saturday
,
Sunday
,
the
28th
,
29th
,
30th
,
and
31st
day
of
my
distress
.
  
<EOS>
and
distress
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
for
here
I
be
still
;
and
every
thing
have
be
bad
and
bad
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
poor
unhappy
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
without
any
hope
leave
,
and
ruin
in
all
my
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
but
<EOS>
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
parent
,
rejoice
with
me
,
even
in
this
low
plunge
of
my
distress
;
for
your
poor
Pamela
have
escape
from
an
enemy
bad
than
any
she
ever
meet
with
;
an
enemy
she
never
think
of
before
,
and
be
hardly
able
to
stand
against
:
I
mean
,
the
weakness
and
presumption
,
both
in
one
,
of
her
own
mind
;
which
have
well
nigh
,
have
not
the
divine
grace
interpose
,
sink
her
into
the
low
,
last
abyss
of
misery
and
perdition
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
proceed
,
as
I
have
opportunity
,
with
my
sad
relation
:
for
my
pen
and
ink
(
in
my
now
doubly
-
secure
closet
)
be
all
I
have
to
employ
myself
with
:
and
indeed
I
have
be
so
weak
,
that
,
till
yesterday
evening
,
I
have
not
be
able
to
hold
a
pen
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
with
me
but
one
shift
,
besides
what
I
have
on
,
and
two
handkerchief
,
and
two
cap
,
which
my
pocket
hold
,
(
for
it
be
not
for
me
to
encumber
myself
,
)
and
all
my
stock
of
money
,
which
be
but
five
or
six
shilling
,
to
set
out
for
I
know
not
where
;
and
get
out
of
the
window
,
not
without
some
difficulty
,
stick
a
little
at
my
shoulder
and
hip
;
but
I
be
resolve
to
get
out
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
farth
from
the
lead
than
I
think
,
and
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
have
sprain
my
ancle
;
and
when
I
have
dropt
from
the
lead
to
the
ground
,
it
be
still
farther
off
;
but
I
do
pretty
well
there
,
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
no
hurt
to
hinder
me
from
pursue
my
intention
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
now
on
the
ground
,
I
hide
my
paper
under
a
rose
-
bush
,
and
cover
them
with
mould
,
and
there
they
still
lie
,
as
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
hie
away
to
the
pond
:
the
clock
strike
twelve
,
just
as
I
get
out
;
and
it
be
a
dark
misty
night
,
and
very
cold
;
but
I
feel
it
not
then
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
the
pond
-
side
,
I
fling
in
my
upper
-
coat
,
as
I
have
design
,
and
my
neckhandkerchief
,
and
a
round
-
eared
cap
,
with
a
knot
;
and
then
with
great
speed
run
to
the
door
,
and
take
the
key
out
of
my
pocket
,
my
poor
heart
beat
all
the
time
against
my
bosom
,
as
if
it
would
have
force
its
way
through
it
:
and
beat
it
well
may
!
<EOS>
for
I
then
,
too
late
,
find
,
that
I
be
most
miserably
disappointed
;
for
the
wicked
woman
have
take
off
that
lock
,
and
put
another
on
;
so
that
my
key
would
not
open
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
,
and
try
,
and
feel
about
,
I
find
a
padlock
besides
,
on
another
part
of
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
o
then
how
my
heart
sink
!
 
<EOS>
I
dropt
down
with
grief
and
confusion
,
unable
to
stir
or
support
myself
,
for
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
fear
awaken
my
resolution
,
and
know
that
my
attempt
would
be
as
terrible
for
me
as
any
other
danger
I
could
then
encounter
<EOS>
,
I
clamber
up
upon
the
ledge
of
the
door
,
and
upon
the
lock
,
which
be
a
great
wooden
one
;
and
reach
the
top
of
the
door
with
my
hand
;
then
,
little
thinking
I
could
climb
so
well
,
I
make
shift
to
lay
hold
on
the
top
of
the
wall
with
my
hand
;
but
,
alas
for
me
!
<EOS>
nothing
but
ill
luck
!
  
<EOS>
no
escape
for
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
the
wall
be
old
,
the
brick
I
hold
by
give
way
,
just
as
I
be
take
a
spring
to
get
up
;
and
down
come
I
,
and
receive
such
a
blow
upon
my
head
,
with
one
of
the
brick
,
that
it
quite
stun
me
;
and
I
break
my
shin
and
my
ancle
besides
,
and
beat
off
the
heel
of
one
of
my
shoe
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
dreadful
way
,
flat
upon
the
ground
,
lie
poor
I
,
for
I
believe
five
or
six
minute
;
and
then
try
to
get
up
,
I
sink
down
again
two
or
three
time
;
and
my
left
hip
and
shoulder
be
very
stiff
,
and
full
of
pain
,
with
bruise
;
and
,
besides
,
my
head
bleed
,
and
ache
grievously
with
the
blow
I
have
with
the
brick
.
 
<EOS>
yet
these
hurt
I
value
not
;
but
creep
a
good
way
upon
my
foot
and
hand
,
in
search
of
a
ladder
<EOS>
,
I
just
recollect
to
have
see
against
the
wall
two
day
before
,
on
which
the
gardener
be
nail
a
nectarine
branch
that
be
loosen
from
the
wall
:
<EOS>
but
no
ladder
could
I
find
,
and
the
wall
be
very
high
.
 
<EOS>
what
now
,
think
I
,
must
become
of
the
miserable
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
then
I
begin
to
wish
myself
most
heartily
again
in
my
closet
,
and
to
repent
of
my
attempt
,
which
I
now
censure
as
rash
,
because
it
do
not
succeed
.
  
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
but
a
sad
thought
come
just
then
into
my
head
!
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
think
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
my
apprehension
of
the
usage
I
should
meet
with
,
have
like
to
have
make
me
miserable
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
,
dear
parent
,
forgive
your
poor
child
;
but
be
then
quite
desperate
<EOS>
,
I
creep
along
,
till
I
could
raise
myself
on
my
staggering
foot
;
and
away
limp
I
!
 
<EOS>
what
to
do
,
but
to
throw
myself
into
the
pond
,
and
so
put
a
period
to
all
my
griefs
in
this
world
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
o
!
<EOS>
to
find
them
infinitely
aggravate
(
have
I
not
,
by
the
divine
grace
,
be
withhold
)
in
a
miserable
eternity
!
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
escape
this
temptation
,
(
bless
be
God
for
it
!
)
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
my
conflict
on
this
dreadful
occasion
,
that
the
divine
mercy
may
be
magnify
in
my
deliverance
,
that
I
be
yet
on
this
side
the
dreadful
gulf
,
from
which
there
could
have
be
no
return
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
me
,
as
I
have
since
think
,
that
I
be
so
maim
,
as
make
me
the
longer
before
I
get
to
the
water
;
for
this
give
me
time
to
consider
,
and
abate
the
impetuousness
of
my
passion
,
which
possibly
may
otherwise
have
hurry
me
,
in
my
first
transport
of
grief
,
(
on
my
see
no
way
to
escape
,
and
the
hard
usage
I
have
reason
to
expect
from
my
dreadful
keeper
,
)
to
throw
myself
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
weakness
of
body
make
me
move
so
slowly
,
that
it
give
time
,
as
I
say
,
for
a
little
reflection
,
a
ray
of
grace
,
to
dart
in
upon
my
benighted
mind
;
and
so
,
when
I
come
to
the
pond
-
side
,
I
sit
myself
down
on
the
sloping
bank
,
and
begin
to
ponder
my
wretched
condition
;
and
thus
I
reason
with
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Pause
here
a
little
,
Pamela
,
on
what
thou
art
about
,
before
thou
takest
the
dreadful
leap
;
and
consider
whether
there
be
no
way
yet
leave
,
<EOS>
no
hope
,
if
not
to
escape
from
this
wicked
house
,
yet
from
the
mischief
threaten
thee
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
consider
;
and
,
after
I
have
cast
about
in
my
mind
every
thing
that
could
make
me
hope
,
and
see
no
probability
;
a
wicked
woman
,
devoid
of
all
compassion
!
<EOS>
a
horrid
helper
,
just
arrive
,
in
this
dreadful
Colbrand
!
<EOS>
an
angry
and
resent
master
,
who
now
hate
me
,
and
threaten
the
most
afflicting
evil
!
<EOS>
and
that
I
should
,
in
all
probability
,
be
deprive
even
of
the
opportunity
,
I
now
have
before
me
,
to
free
myself
from
all
their
persecution
!
 
<EOS>
what
hast
thou
to
do
,
distressed
creature
,
say
I
to
myself
,
but
throw
thyself
upon
a
merciful
God
,
(
who
know
how
innocently
I
suffer
,
)
to
avoid
the
merciless
wickedness
of
those
who
be
determined
on
my
ruin
?
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
think
I
,
(
<EOS>
and
oh
!
<EOS>
that
thought
be
surely
of
the
devil
's
instigation
;
for
it
be
very
soothing
,
and
powerful
with
me
,
)
<EOS>
these
wicked
wretch
,
who
now
have
no
remorse
,
no
pity
on
me
,
will
then
be
move
to
lament
their
misdoing
;
and
when
they
see
the
dead
corpse
of
the
unhappy
Pamela
drag
out
to
these
dewy
bank
,
and
lie
breathless
at
their
foot
,
they
will
find
that
remorse
to
soften
their
obdurate
heart
,
which
,
now
,
have
no
place
there
!
 
<EOS>
and
my
master
,
my
angry
master
,
will
then
forget
his
resentment
,
and
say
,
o
,
this
be
the
unhappy
Pamela
!
<EOS>
that
I
have
so
causelessly
persecute
and
destroy
!
 
<EOS>
now
do
I
see
she
prefer
her
honesty
to
her
life
,
will
he
say
,
and
be
no
hypocrite
,
nor
deceiver
;
but
really
be
the
innocent
creature
she
pretend
to
be
!
<EOS>
then
,
think
I
,
will
he
,
perhaps
,
shed
a
few
tear
over
the
poor
corpse
of
his
persecute
servant
;
and
though
he
may
give
out
,
it
be
love
and
disappointment
;
and
that
,
perhaps
,
(
in
order
to
hide
his
own
guilt
,
)
for
the
unfortunate
Mr.
Williams
,
yet
will
he
be
inwardly
grieve
,
and
order
me
a
decent
funeral
,
and
save
me
,
or
rather
this
part
of
me
,
from
the
dreadful
stake
,
and
the
highway
interment
;
and
the
young
man
and
maiden
all
around
my
dear
father
's
will
pity
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
o
!
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
the
subject
of
their
ballad
and
elegy
;
but
that
my
memory
,
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
may
quickly
slide
into
oblivion
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
once
rise
,
<EOS>
so
indulgent
be
I
to
this
sad
way
of
thinking
,
to
throw
myself
in
:
<EOS>
but
,
again
,
my
bruise
make
me
slow
;
and
I
think
,
what
art
thou
about
to
do
,
wretche
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
how
knowest
thou
,
though
the
prospect
be
all
dark
to
thy
short
-
sight
eye
,
what
God
may
do
for
thee
,
even
when
all
human
mean
fail
?
 
<EOS>
God
Almighty
would
not
lay
me
under
these
sore
affliction
,
if
he
have
not
give
me
strength
to
grapple
with
them
,
if
I
will
exert
it
as
I
ought
:
and
who
know
,
but
that
the
very
presence
<EOS>
I
so
much
dread
of
my
angry
and
design
master
,
(
for
he
have
have
me
in
his
power
before
,
and
yet
I
have
escape
;
)
may
be
well
for
me
,
than
these
persecute
emissary
of
his
,
who
,
for
his
money
,
be
true
to
their
wicked
trust
,
and
be
harden
by
that
,
and
a
long
habit
of
wickedness
,
against
compunction
of
heart
?
 
<EOS>
God
can
touch
his
heart
in
an
instant
;
and
if
this
should
not
be
do
,
I
can
then
but
put
an
end
to
my
life
by
some
other
mean
,
if
I
be
so
resolve
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
do
I
know
,
think
<EOS>
I
,
that
even
these
bruise
and
maim
that
I
have
get
,
while
I
pursue
only
the
laudable
escape
I
have
meditate
,
may
not
kindly
have
furnish
me
with
the
opportunity
I
be
now
tempt
with
to
precipitate
myself
,
and
of
surrender
up
my
life
,
spotless
and
unguilty
,
to
that
merciful
being
who
give
it
!
  
<EOS>
then
,
think
I
,
who
give
thee
,
presumptuous
as
thou
art
,
a
power
over
thy
life
?
 
<EOS>
who
authorise
thee
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
when
the
weakness
of
thy
mind
suggest
not
to
thee
a
way
to
preserve
it
with
honour
?
 
<EOS>
how
knowest
thou
<EOS>
what
purpose
God
may
have
to
serve
,
by
the
trial
with
which
thou
art
now
exercise
?
 
<EOS>
Art
thou
to
put
a
bind
to
the
divine
will
,
and
to
say
<EOS>
,
thus
much
will
I
bear
,
and
no
more
?
 
<EOS>
and
wilt
thou
dare
to
say
,
that
if
the
trial
be
augment
and
continue
,
thou
wilt
sooner
die
than
bear
it
?
  
<EOS>
this
act
of
despondency
,
think
I
,
be
a
sin
,
that
,
if
I
pursue
it
,
admit
of
no
repentance
,
and
can
therefore
hope
no
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
and
wilt
thou
,
to
shorten
thy
transitory
griefs
,
heavy
as
they
be
,
and
weak
as
thou
fanciest
thyself
,
plunge
both
body
and
soul
into
everlasting
misery
!
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Pamela
,
think
I
,
thou
art
<EOS>
the
innocent
,
the
suffer
Pamela
;
and
wilt
thou
,
to
avoid
thy
suffering
,
be
the
guilty
aggressor
?
 
<EOS>
and
,
because
wicked
man
persecute
thee
,
wilt
thou
fly
in
the
face
of
the
Almighty
,
and
distrust
his
grace
and
goodness
,
who
can
still
turn
all
these
suffering
to
benefit
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
do
I
know
,
but
that
God
,
who
see
all
the
lurk
vileness
of
my
heart
,
may
have
permit
these
suffering
on
that
very
score
,
and
to
make
me
rely
solely
on
his
grace
and
assistance
,
who
,
perhaps
,
have
too
much
pride
myself
in
a
vain
dependence
on
my
own
foolish
contrivance
?
  
<EOS>
then
,
again
,
think
I
,
wilt
thou
suffer
in
one
moment
all
the
good
lesson
of
thy
poor
honest
parent
,
and
the
benefit
of
their
example
,
(
who
have
persist
in
do
their
duty
with
resignation
to
the
divine
will
,
amidst
the
extreme
degree
of
disappointment
,
poverty
,
and
distress
,
and
the
persecution
of
an
ungrateful
world
,
and
merciless
creditor
,
)
to
be
throw
away
upon
thee
:
and
bring
down
,
as
in
all
probability
this
thy
rashness
will
,
their
grey
hair
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
,
when
they
shall
understand
,
that
their
beloved
daughter
,
slight
the
tender
of
divine
grace
,
despairing
of
the
mercy
of
a
protect
God
,
have
blemish
,
in
this
last
act
,
a
whole
life
,
which
they
have
hitherto
approve
and
delight
in
?
  
<EOS>
what
then
,
presumptuous
Pamela
,
dost
thou
here
?
<EOS>
think
I
<EOS>
:
quit
with
speed
these
perilous
bank
,
and
fly
from
these
curl
water
,
that
seem
,
in
their
meaning
murmur
,
this
still
night
,
to
reproach
thy
rashness
!
<EOS>
tempt
not
God
's
goodness
on
the
mossy
bank
,
that
have
be
witness
of
thy
guilty
purpose
:
and
while
thou
hast
power
leave
thee
,
avoid
the
tempting
evil
,
lest
thy
grand
enemy
,
now
repulse
by
divine
grace
,
and
due
reflection
,
return
to
the
assault
with
a
force
that
thy
weakness
may
not
be
able
to
resist
!
<EOS>
and
let
one
rash
moment
destroy
all
the
conviction
,
which
now
have
awe
thy
rebellious
mind
into
duty
and
resignation
to
the
divine
will
!
  
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
I
arise
;
but
be
so
stiff
with
my
hurt
,
so
cold
with
the
moist
dew
of
the
night
,
and
the
wet
grass
on
which
I
have
sit
,
as
also
with
the
damp
arise
from
so
large
a
piece
of
water
,
<EOS>
that
with
great
pain
I
get
from
this
pond
,
which
now
I
think
of
with
terror
;
and
bend
my
limping
step
towards
the
house
,
take
refuge
in
the
corner
of
an
outhouse
,
where
wood
and
coal
be
lay
up
for
family
use
,
till
I
should
be
find
by
my
cruel
keeper
,
and
consign
to
a
more
wretched
confinement
,
and
bad
usage
than
I
have
hitherto
experience
;
and
there
behind
a
pile
of
firewood
I
creep
,
and
lie
down
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
with
a
mind
just
break
,
and
a
heart
sensible
to
nothing
but
the
extremest
woe
and
dejection
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
be
the
issue
of
your
poor
Pamela
's
fruitless
enterprise
;
and
who
know
,
if
I
have
get
out
at
the
back
-
door
,
whether
I
have
be
at
all
in
a
well
case
,
moneyless
,
friendless
,
as
I
be
,
and
in
a
strange
place
!
 
<EOS>
but
blame
not
your
poor
daughter
too
much
:
<EOS>
nay
,
if
ever
you
see
this
miserable
scribble
,
all
bathe
and
blot
with
my
tear
,
let
your
pity
get
the
well
of
your
reprehension
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
it
will
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
leave
off
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
strength
and
my
will
are
at
this
time
very
far
unequal
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
I
will
add
,
that
though
I
should
have
praise
God
for
my
deliverance
,
have
I
be
free
from
my
wicked
keeper
,
and
my
designing
master
;
yet
I
have
more
abundant
reason
to
praise
him
,
that
I
have
be
deliver
from
a
bad
enemy
,
 
myself
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
conclude
my
sad
relation
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
Mrs.
Jewkes
awake
not
till
day
-
break
;
and
not
find
me
in
bed
,
she
call
me
;
and
,
no
answer
be
return
,
she
relate
,
that
she
get
out
of
bed
,
and
run
to
my
closet
;
and
,
miss
me
,
search
under
the
bed
,
and
in
another
closet
,
find
the
chamber
-
door
as
she
have
leave
it
,
quite
fast
,
and
the
key
,
as
usual
,
about
her
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
I
could
have
get
out
of
the
chamber
-
door
,
there
be
two
or
three
passage
,
and
door
to
them
all
,
double
-
lock
and
bar
,
to
go
through
into
the
great
garden
;
so
that
,
to
escape
,
there
be
no
way
,
but
out
of
the
window
;
and
of
that
window
,
because
of
the
summer
-
parlour
under
it
:
<EOS>
for
the
other
window
be
a
great
way
from
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
she
be
excessively
frightened
;
and
instantly
raise
the
Swiss
,
and
the
two
maid
,
who
lie
not
far
off
;
and
find
every
door
fast
,
she
say
,
I
must
be
carry
away
,
as
St.
Peter
be
out
of
prison
,
by
some
angel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
she
have
not
a
bad
thought
!
  
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
weep
,
and
wring
her
hand
,
and
take
on
sadly
,
run
about
like
a
mad
woman
,
little
thinking
I
could
have
get
out
of
the
closet
window
,
between
the
iron
bar
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
do
not
know
whether
I
could
do
so
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
last
finding
that
casement
open
,
they
conclude
it
must
be
so
;
and
run
out
into
the
garden
,
and
find
my
footstep
in
the
mould
of
the
bed
which
I
dropt
down
upon
from
the
lead
:
and
so
speed
away
all
of
them
;
that
be
to
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Colbrand
,
and
Nan
,
towards
the
back
-
door
,
to
see
if
that
be
fast
;
while
the
cook
be
send
to
the
out
-
office
to
raise
the
man
,
and
make
them
get
horse
ready
,
to
take
each
a
several
way
to
pursue
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
it
seem
,
find
that
door
double
-
lock
and
padlock
,
and
the
heel
of
my
shoe
,
and
the
broken
brick
,
they
verily
conclude
I
be
get
away
by
some
mean
over
the
wall
;
and
then
,
they
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
seem
like
a
distracted
woman
:
<EOS>
till
,
at
last
,
Nan
have
the
thought
to
go
towards
the
pond
:
and
there
see
my
coat
,
and
cap
,
and
handkerchief
,
in
the
water
,
cast
almost
to
the
bank
by
the
agitation
of
the
wave
,
she
think
it
be
me
;
and
,
scream
out
,
run
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
say
,
o
,
madam
,
madam
!
<EOS>
here
be
a
piteous
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pamela
lie
drown
in
the
pond
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
they
all
run
;
and
find
my
clothe
,
doubt
not
I
be
at
the
bottom
;
and
they
all
,
swiss
among
the
rest
,
beat
their
breast
,
and
make
most
dismal
lamentation
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
send
Nan
to
the
man
,
to
bid
them
get
the
drag
-
net
ready
,
and
leave
the
horse
,
and
come
to
try
to
find
the
poor
innocent
!
<EOS>
as
she
,
it
seem
,
then
call
me
,
beat
her
breast
,
and
lament
my
hard
hap
;
but
most
what
would
become
of
them
,
and
what
account
they
should
give
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
while
every
one
be
thus
differently
employ
,
some
weeping
and
wailing
,
some
run
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
Nan
come
into
the
wood
-
house
;
and
there
lie
poor
I
;
so
weak
,
so
low
,
and
deject
,
and
withal
<EOS>
so
stiff
with
my
bruise
,
that
I
could
not
stir
,
nor
help
myself
to
get
upon
my
foot
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
with
a
low
voice
,
(
for
I
could
hardly
speak
,
)
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ann
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ann
!
 
<EOS>
the
creature
be
sadly
frightened
,
but
be
take
up
a
billet
to
knock
me
on
the
head
,
believe
I
be
some
thief
,
as
she
say
;
but
I
cry
out
,
o
<EOS>
Mrs.
Ann
,
Mrs.
Ann
,
help
me
,
for
pity
's
sake
,
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
get
up
!
 
<EOS>
bless
me
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
what

<EOS>

<EOS>
why
,
our
heart

almost
break
,
and
we
be
go
to
drag
the
pond
for
you
,
believe
you
have
drown
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
say
she
,
you
will
make
us
all
alive
again
!
  
<EOS>
and
,
without
help
me
,
she
run
away
to
the
pond
,
and
bring
all
the
crew
to
the
wood
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
wicked
woman
,
as
she
enter
,
say
,
where
be
she
?
 
<EOS>
Plague
of
her
spell
,
and
her
witchcraft
!
 
<EOS>
She
shall
dearly
repent
of
this
trick
,
if
my
name
be
Jewkes
;
and
,
come
to
me
,
take
hold
of
my
arm
so
roughly
,
and
give
me
such
a
pull
,
as
make
me
squeal
out
,
(
my
shoulder
be
bruise
on
that
side
,
)
and
draw
me
on
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
o
cruel
creature
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
if
you
know
what
I
have
suffer
,
it
would
move
you
to
pity
me
!
  
<EOS>
even
Colbrand
seem
to
be
concern
,
and
say
,
Fie
,
madam
,
fie
!
<EOS>
you
see
she
be
almost
dead
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
so
rough
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
coachman
Robin
seem
to
be
sorry
for
me
too
,
and
say
,
with
sobs
,
what
a
scene
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
she
be
all
bloody
in
her
head
,
and
can
not
stir
?
  
<EOS>
curse
of
her
contrivance
!
<EOS>
say
the
horrid
creature
;
she
have
frighten
me
out
of
my
wit
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
d####l
come
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
oh
!
say
I
,
ask
me
now
no
question
,
but
let
the
maid
carry
me
up
to
my
prison
;
and
there
let
me
die
decently
,
and
in
peace
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
I
think
I
could
not
live
two
hour
.
  
<EOS>
the
still
more
inhuman
tigress
say
,
I
suppose
you
want
Mr.
Williams
to
pray
by
you
,
do
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
send
for
my
master
this
minute
:
let
him
come
and
watch
you
himself
,
for
me
;
for
there
be
no
such
thing
as
hold
you
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
maid
take
me
up
between
them
,
and
carry
me
to
my
chamber
;
and
when
the
wretch
see
how
bad
I
be
,
she
begin
a
little
to
relent
 
while
every
one
wonder
(
at
which
I
have
neither
strength
nor
inclination
to
tell
them
)
how
all
this
come
to
pass
,
which
they
impute
to
sorcery
and
witchcraft
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
weak
,
when
I
have
get
up
stair
,
that
I
faint
away
,
with
dejection
,
pain
,
and
fatigue
;
and
they
undress
me
,
and
get
me
to
bed
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
order
Nan
to
bathe
my
shoulder
,
and
arm
,
and
ancle
,
with
some
old
rum
warm
;
and
they
cut
the
hair
a
little
from
the
back
part
of
my
head
,
and
wash
that
;
for
it
be
clot
with
blood
,
from
a
pretty
long
,
but
not
a
deep
gash
;
and
put
a
family
plaister
upon
it
;
for
,
if
this
woman
have
any
good
quality
,
it
be
,
it
seem
,
in
a
readiness
and
skill
to
manage
in
case
,
where
sudden
misfortune
happen
in
a
family
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
I
fall
into
a
pretty
sound
and
refreshing
sleep
,
and
lie
till
twelve
o'clock
,
tolerably
easy
,
consider
I
be
very
feverish
,
and
aguishly
inclined
;
and
she
take
a
deal
of
care
to
fit
me
to
undergo
more
trial
,
which
I
have
hope
would
have
be
happily
end
:
but
Providence
do
not
see
fit
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
make
me
rise
about
twelve
:
but
I
be
so
weak
<EOS>
,
I
could
only
sit
up
till
the
bed
be
make
,
and
go
into
it
again
;
and
be
,
as
they
say
,
delirious
some
part
of
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
but
have
a
tolerable
night
on
Thursday
,
I
be
a
good
deal
better
on
Friday
,
and
on
Saturday
get
up
,
and
eat
a
little
spoon
-
meat
,
and
my
feverishness
seem
to
be
go
;
and
I
be
so
mend
by
evening
,
that
I
beg
her
indulgence
in
my
closet
,
to
be
leave
to
myself
;
which
she
consent
to
<EOS>
,
it
be
double
-
bar
the
day
before
,
and
I
assure
her
,
that
all
my
contrivance
,
as
she
call
them
,
be
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
but
first
she
make
me
tell
the
whole
story
of
my
enterprise
;
which
I
do
very
faithfully
,
know
now
that
nothing
could
stand
me
in
any
stead
,
or
contribute
to
my
safety
and
escape
:
<EOS>
and
she
seem
full
of
wonder
at
my
resolution
;
but
tell
me
frankly
,
that
I
should
have
find
it
a
hard
matter
to
get
quite
off
;
for
that
she
be
provide
with
a
warrant
from
my
master
(
who
be
a
justice
of
peace
in
this
county
as
well
as
in
the
other
)
to
get
me
apprehend
,
if
I
have
get
away
,
on
suspicion
of
wrong
him
,
let
me
have
be
where
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
deep
-
lay
be
the
mischief
design
to
fall
on
my
devoted
head
!
  
<EOS>
surely
,
surely
,
I
can
not
be
worthy
of
all
this
contrivance
!
 
<EOS>
this
too
well
shew
me
the
truth
of
what
be
hint
to
me
formerly
at
the
other
house
,
that
my
master
swear
he
would
have
me
!
 
<EOS>
o
preserve
me
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
from
be
his
,
in
his
own
wicked
sense
of
the
adjuration
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
add
,
that
now
the
woman
see
me
pick
up
so
fast
,
she
use
me
worse
,
and
have
abridge
me
of
paper
,
all
but
one
sheet
,
which
I
be
to
shew
her
,
write
or
unwritten
,
on
demand
:
and
have
reduce
me
to
one
pen
:
yet
my
hide
store
stand
me
in
stead
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
more
and
more
snappish
and
cross
;
and
tauntingly
call
me
Mrs.
Williams
,
and
any
thing
she
think
will
vex
me
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
think
fit
to
give
me
an
airing
,
for
three
or
four
hour
,
this
afternoon
;
and
I
be
a
good
deal
better
and
should
be
much
more
so
,
if
I
know
for
what
I
be
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
but
health
be
a
blessing
hardly
to
be
covet
in
my
circumstance
,
since
that
<EOS>
but
expose
me
to
the
calamity
I
be
in
continual
apprehension
of
;
whereas
a
weak
and
sickly
state
may
possibly
move
compassion
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
dread
the
coming
of
this
angry
and
incensed
master
;
though
I
be
sure
I
have
do
him
no
harm
!
  
<EOS>
just
now
we
hear
,
that
he
have
like
to
have
be
drown
in
cross
the
stream
,
a
few
day
ago
,
in
pursue
his
game
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
,
that
with
all
his
ill
usage
of
me
,
I
can
not
hate
him
?
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
be
not
like
other
people
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
certainly
do
enough
to
make
me
hate
him
;
but
<EOS>
yet
,
when
I
hear
his
danger
,
which
be
very
great
,
I
could
not
in
my
heart
forbear
rejoice
for
his
safety
;
though
his
death
would
have
end
my
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
ungenerous
master
!
<EOS>
if
you
know
this
,
you
surely
would
not
be
so
much
my
persecutor
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
my
late
good
lady
's
sake
,
I
must
wish
him
well
;
and
o
what
an
angel
would
he
be
in
my
eye
yet
,
if
he
would
cease
his
attempt
,
and
reform
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
hear
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
John
Arnold
be
turn
away
,
be
detect
in
write
to
Mr.
Williams
;
and
that
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
the
butler
,
have
incur
his
displeasure
,
for
offer
to
speak
in
my
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
too
be
in
danger
;
for
all
these
three
,
probably
,
go
together
to
beg
in
my
favour
;
for
now
it
be
know
where
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
,
with
the
news
about
my
master
,
receive
a
letter
:
but
she
say
the
content
be
too
bad
for
me
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
bad
indeed
,
if
they
be
bad
than
what
I
have
already
know
.
  
<EOS>
just
now
the
horrid
creature
tell
me
,
as
a
secret
,
that
she
have
reason
to
think
he
have
find
out
a
way
to
satisfy
my
scruple
:
<EOS>
It
be
,
by
marry
me
to
this
dreadful
Colbrand
,
and
buy
me
of
him
on
the
wedding
day
,
for
a
sum
of
money
!
 
<EOS>
be
ever
the
like
hear
?
 
<EOS>
She
say
it
will
be
my
duty
to
obey
my
husband
;
and
that
Mr.
Williams
will
be
force
,
as
a
punishment
,
to
marry
us
;
and
that
,
when
my
master
have
pay
for
me
,
and
I
be
surrender
up
,
the
Swiss
be
to
go
home
again
,
with
the
money
,
to
his
former
wife
and
child
;
for
,
she
say
,
it
be
the
custom
of
those
people
to
have
a
wife
in
every
nation
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
,
to
be
sure
,
be
horrid
romance
!
 
<EOS>
yet
,
abominable
as
it
be
,
it
may
possibly
serve
to
introduce
some
plot
now
hatch
!
 
<EOS>
with
what
strange
perplexity
be
my
poor
mind
agitate
!
 
<EOS>
perchance
,
some
sham
-
marriage
may
be
design
,
on
purpose
to
ruin
me
;
but
can
a
husband
sell
his
wife
against
her
own
consent
?
 
<EOS>
and
will
such
a
bargain
stand
good
in
law
?
  
<EOS>
Monday
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
the
32d
,
33d
,
and
34th
day
of
my
imprisonment
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
offer
these
day
but
squabbling
between
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
me
.
<EOS>
She
grow
bad
and
bad
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
vex
her
yesterday
,
because
she
talk
nastily
;
and
tell
her
she
talk
more
like
a
vile
London
prostitute
,
than
a
gentleman
's
housekeeper
;
and
she
think
she
can
not
use
me
bad
enough
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
bless
me
!
<EOS>
she
curse
and
storm
at
me
like
a
trooper
,
and
can
hardly
keep
her
hand
off
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
she
must
talk
sadly
,
to
make
me
say
such
harsh
word
:
indeed
it
can
not
be
repeat
;
as
she
be
a
disgrace
to
her
sex
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
ridicule
me
,
and
laugh
at
my
notion
of
honesty
;
and
tell
me
,
impudent
creature
as
she
be
!
<EOS>
what
a
fine
bed
-
fellow
<EOS>
I
shall
make
for
my
master
(
and
such-
like
)
,
with
such
whimsical
notion
about
me
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
this
be
to
be
bear
?
 
<EOS>
and
yet
she
talk
bad
than
this
,
if
possible
!
<EOS>
quite
filthily
!
<EOS>
o
what
vile
hand
be
I
put
into
!
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
all
the
reason
that
can
be
,
to
apprehend
my
master
will
be
here
soon
;
for
the
servant
be
busy
in
set
the
house
to
right
;
and
a
stable
and
coach
-
house
be
clean
out
,
that
have
not
be
use
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
but
she
tell
me
nothing
,
nor
will
hardly
answer
me
when
I
ask
her
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
she
put
on
these
strange
wicked
air
to
me
,
purposely
to
make
me
wish
for
,
what
I
dread
most
of
all
thing
,
my
master
be
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
talk
of
love
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
any
the
least
notion
of
regard
for
me
,
to
be
sure
he
would
not
give
this
naughty
body
such
power
over
me
:
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
come
,
where
be
his
promise
of
not
see
me
without
I
consent
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
it
seem
,
his
honour
owe
me
nothing
!
 
<EOS>
so
he
tell
me
in
his
letter
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
?
 
<EOS>
because
I
be
willing
to
keep
mine
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
he
say
,
he
hate
me
perfectly
:
<EOS>
but
it
be
plain
he
do
,
or
I
should
not
be
leave
to
the
mercy
of
this
woman
:
and
,
what
be
bad
,
to
my
woful
apprehension
.
  
<EOS>
Friday
,
the
36th
day
of
my
imprisonment
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
yesterday
afternoon
,
find
the
gate
open
,
to
walk
out
before
the
house
;
and
,
ere
I
be
aware
,
have
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
long
row
of
elm
;
and
there
I
sit
myself
down
upon
the
step
of
a
sort
of
broad
stile
,
which
lead
into
the
road
,
and
go
towards
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
sit
muse
upon
what
always
busy
my
mind
,
I
see
a
whole
body
of
folk
run
towards
me
from
the
house
,
man
and
woman
,
as
in
a
fright
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
wonder
what
be
the
matter
,
till
they
come
nearer
;
and
I
find
they
be
all
alarm
,
think
I
have
attempt
to
get
off
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
first
the
horrible
colbrand
,
run
with
his
long
leg
,
<EOS>
well
nigh
two
yard
at
a
stride
<EOS>
;
then
there
be
one
of
the
groom
,
poor
Mr.
Williams
's
robber
;
then
I
spy
Nan
,
half
out
of
breath
,
and
the
cook
-
maid
after
her
!
<EOS>
and
lastly
,
come
waddle
,
as
fast
as
she
could
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
exclaim
most
bitterly
,
as
I
find
,
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Colbrand
say
,
o
how
have
you
fright
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
and
go
behind
me
,
lest
I
should
run
away
,
as
I
suppose
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
still
,
to
let
them
see
I
have
no
view
to
get
away
;
for
,
besides
the
improbability
of
succeed
,
my
last
sad
attempt
have
cure
me
of
enterprise
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
within
hearing
,
I
find
her
terribly
incensed
,
and
rave
about
my
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
should
you
be
so
concerned
?
 
<EOS>
here
I
have
sit
a
few
minute
,
and
have
not
the
least
thought
of
get
away
,
or
go
farther
;
but
to
return
as
soon
as
it
be
duskish
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
believe
me
;
and
the
barbarous
creature
strike
at
me
with
her
horrid
fist
,
and
,
I
believe
,
would
have
fell
me
,
have
not
Colbrand
interpose
,
and
say
,
He
see
me
sit
still
,
look
about
me
,
and
not
seem
to
have
the
least
inclination
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
would
not
serve
:
She
order
the
two
maid
to
take
me
each
by
an
arm
,
and
lead
me
back
into
the
house
,
and
up
stair
;
and
there
have
I
be
lock
up
ever
since
,
without
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
have
I
plead
,
that
I
have
no
design
,
as
indeed
I
have
not
the
least
;
and
last
night
I
be
force
to
be
between
her
and
Nan
;
and
I
find
she
be
resolve
to
make
a
handle
of
this
against
me
,
and
in
her
own
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
what
with
her
usage
,
and
my
own
apprehension
of
still
bad
,
I
be
quite
weary
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
just
now
she
have
be
with
me
,
and
give
me
my
shoe
,
and
have
lay
her
imperious
command
upon
me
,
to
dress
myself
in
a
suit
of
clothe
out
of
the
portmanteau
,
which
I
have
not
see
lately
,
against
three
or
four
o'clock
;
for
she
say
,
she
be
to
have
a
visit
from
Lady
Darnford
's
two
daughter
,
who
come
purposely
to
see
me
;
and
so
she
give
me
the
key
of
the
portmanteau
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
obey
her
;
and
I
tell
her
,
I
would
not
be
make
a
show
of
,
nor
see
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
She
leave
me
,
say
,
it
would
be
bad
for
me
,
if
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
can
that
be
?
  
<EOS>
five
o'clock
be
come
,
  
and
no
young
lady
!
 
<EOS>
so
that
I
fancy
 
but
hold
!
 
<EOS>
I
hear
their
coach
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
step
to
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
down
to
them
,
I
be
resolve
   
good
sir
!
<EOS>
good
sir
!
 
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
me
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
my
master
come
in
his
fine
chariot
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
!
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
where
shall
I
hide
myself
?
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
pray
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
will
not
see
this
!
  
<EOS>
N
ow
,
good
God
of
heaven
,
preserve
me
;
if
it
be
thy
bless
will
!
  
<EOS>
seven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
dread
to
see
him
,
yet
do
I
wonder
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
something
be
resolve
against
me
,
and
he
stay
to
hear
all
her
story
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
write
;
yet
,
as
I
can
do
nothing
else
,
I
know
not
how
to
forbear
!
 
<EOS>
yet
I
can
not
hold
my
pen
 
<EOS>
how
crooked
and
tremble
the
line
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
must
leave
off
,
till
I
can
get
quieter
finger
!
 
<EOS>
why
should
the
guiltless
tremble
<EOS>
so
,
when
the
guilty
can
possess
their
mind
in
peace
?
  
<EOS>
Saturday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
now
let
me
give
you
an
account
of
what
pass
last
night
:
for
I
have
no
power
to
write
,
nor
yet
opportunity
till
now
.
  
<EOS>
this
vile
woman
hold
my
master
till
half
an
hour
after
seven
;
and
he
come
hither
about
five
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
hear
his
voice
on
the
stair
,
as
he
be
come
up
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
his
supper
;
for
he
say
,
I
shall
choose
a
boil
chicken
with
butter
and
parsley
.
 
<EOS>
and
up
he
come
!
  
<EOS>
He
put
on
a
stern
and
majestic
air
;
and
he
can
look
very
majestic
when
he
please
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
perverse
Pamela
,
ungrateful
runaway
,
say
he
,
for
my
first
salutation
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
well
,
do
not
you
,
to
give
me
all
this
trouble
and
vexation
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
;
but
throw
myself
on
the
floor
,
hide
my
face
,
and
be
ready
to
die
with
grief
and
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
well
may
you
hide
your
face
!
<EOS>
well
may
you
be
ashamed
to
see
me
,
vile
forward
one
,
as
you
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
sob
and
weep
,
but
could
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
let
me
lie
,
and
go
to
the
door
,
and
call
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
say
he
,
take
up
that
fall
angel
!
 
<EOS>
once
I
think
her
as
innocent
as
an
angel
of
light
<EOS>
but
I
have
now
no
patience
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
hypocrite
prostrate
herself
thus
,
in
hope
to
move
my
weakness
in
her
favour
,
and
that
I
will
raise
her
from
the
floor
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
touch
her
:
<EOS>
no
,
say
he
,
cruel
gentleman
as
he
be
!
<EOS>
let
such
fellow
as
Williams
be
take
in
by
her
artful
wile
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
now
,
and
see
she
be
for
any
fool
's
turn
,
that
will
be
catch
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
sigh
,
as
if
my
heart
would
break
!
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
lift
me
up
upon
my
knee
;
for
I
tremble
so
,
I
could
not
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
say
she
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
learn
to
know
your
good
friend
;
confess
your
unworthy
behaviour
,
and
beg
his
honour
's
forgiveness
of
all
your
fault
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
faint
:
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
She
be
mistress
of
art
,
I
will
assure
you
;
and
will
mimic
a
fit
,
ten
to
one
,
in
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
strike
to
the
heart
at
this
;
but
could
not
speak
presently
;
only
lift
up
my
eye
to
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
and
at
last
make
shift
to
say
 
God
forgive
you
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
He
seem
in
a
great
passion
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
cast
sometimes
an
eye
upon
me
,
and
seem
as
if
he
would
have
speak
,
but
check
himself
 
<EOS>
and
at
last
he
say
,
when
she
have
act
this
her
first
part
over
,
perhaps
I
will
see
her
again
,
and
she
shall
soon
know
what
she
have
to
trust
to
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
out
of
the
room
:
<EOS>
and
I
be
quite
sick
at
heart
!
 
<EOS>
surely
,
say
I
,
I
be
the
wicked
creature
that
ever
breathe
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
the
impertinent
,
not
so
wicked
as
that
neither
;
but
I
be
glad
you
begin
to
see
your
fault
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
like
be
humble
!
 
<EOS>
come
,
I
will
stand
your
friend
,
and
plead
for
you
,
if
you
will
promise
to
be
more
dutiful
for
the
future
:
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
add
the
wretch
,
this
may
be
all
make
up
by
to
-
morrow
morning
,
if
you
be
not
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
Begone
,
hideous
woman
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
and
let
not
my
affliction
be
add
to
by
thy
inexorable
cruelty
,
and
unwomanly
wickedness
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
push
,
and
go
away
in
a
violent
passion
:
<EOS>
and
it
seem
,
she
make
a
story
of
this
;
and
say
,
I
have
such
a
spirit
,
there
be
no
bearing
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
lay
me
down
on
the
floor
,
and
have
no
power
to
stir
,
till
the
clock
strike
nine
:
and
then
the
wicked
woman
come
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
come
down
stair
,
say
she
,
to
my
master
;
that
is
,
if
you
please
,
spirit
!
 
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
can
not
stand
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
say
she
,
I
will
send
Mons
.
<EOS>
colbrand
to
carry
you
down
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
up
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
tremble
all
the
way
down
stair
:
<EOS>
and
she
go
before
me
into
the
parlour
;
and
a
new
servant
that
he
have
wait
on
him
,
instead
of
John
,
withdraw
as
soon
as
I
come
in
:
<EOS>
and
,
by
the
way
,
he
have
a
new
coachman
too
,
which
look
as
if
Bedfordshire
Robin
be
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
say
he
,
when
I
come
down
,
you
should
have
sit
at
table
with
me
,
when
I
have
not
company
;
but
when
I
find
you
can
not
forget
your
original
,
but
must
prefer
my
menial
to
me
,
I
call
you
down
to
wait
on
me
while
I
sup
,
that
I
may
have
some
talk
with
you
,
and
throw
away
as
little
time
as
possible
upon
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
do
me
honour
to
wait
upon
you
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
shall
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
forget
my
original
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
force
to
stand
behind
his
chair
,
that
I
may
hold
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
fill
me
,
say
he
,
a
glass
of
that
Burgundy
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
do
it
,
but
my
hand
shake
so
,
that
I
could
not
hold
the
plate
with
the
glass
in
it
,
and
spill
some
of
the
wine
.
 
<EOS>
so
Mrs.
Jewkes
pour
it
for
me
,
and
I
carry
it
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
make
a
low
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
it
,
and
say
,
stand
behind
me
,
out
of
my
sight
!
  
<EOS>
why
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
he
,
you
tell
me
she
remain
very
sullen
still
,
and
eat
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
,
not
so
much
as
will
keep
life
and
soul
together
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
always
cry
,
you
say
,
too
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
answer
she
,
I
think
she
be
,
for
one
thing
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
he
,
your
young
wench
will
feed
upon
their
tear
;
and
their
obstinacy
will
serve
them
for
meat
and
drink
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
see
her
look
better
though
,
in
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
suppose
,
she
live
upon
love
.
 
<EOS>
this
sweet
Mr.
Williams
,
and
her
little
villanous
plot
together
,
have
keep
her
alive
and
well
,
to
be
sure
:
for
mischief
,
love
,
and
contradiction
,
be
the
natural
aliment
of
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
I
be
force
to
hear
all
this
,
and
be
silent
;
and
indeed
my
heart
be
too
full
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
you
say
,
say
he
,
that
she
have
another
project
,
but
yesterday
,
to
get
away
?
 
<EOS>
She
deny
it
herself
,
say
she
;
but
it
have
all
the
appearance
of
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
make
me
in
a
fearful
pucker
about
it
:
<EOS>
and
I
be
glad
your
honour
be
come
,
with
all
my
heart
;
and
I
hope
,
whatever
be
your
honour
's
intention
concern
her
,
you
will
not
be
long
about
it
;
for
you
will
find
her
as
slippery
as
an
eel
,
I
will
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
and
clasp
his
knee
with

<EOS>
Wicked

<EOS>
say
he
,
to
tempt
a
man
to
undo
himself
,
as
you
have
do
him
,
at
a
time
I
be
on
the
point
of
make
him
happy
for
his
life

<EOS>
I
arise
;
but
say
with
a
deep
sigh
,
I
have
do
,
sir

<EOS>
I
have
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
strange
tribunal
to
plead
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
sheep
in
the
fable
have
such
an
one
;
when
it
be
try
before
the
vulture
,
on
the
accusation
of
the
wolf
!
  
<EOS>
so
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
he
,
you
be
the
wolf
,
I
the
vulture
,
and
this
the
poor
innocent
lamb
on
her
trial
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
how
well
this
innocent
be
read
in
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
wit
at
will
,
when
she
have
a
mind
to
display
her
own
romantic
innocence
,
at
the
price
of
other
people
's
character
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
the
aggravated
creature
,
this
be
nothing
to
what
she
have
call
me
<EOS>
:
I
have
be
a
Jezebel
,
a
London
prostitute
,
and
what
not
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
content
with
her
ill
name
<EOS>
,
now
I
see
it
be
her
fashion
,
and
she
can
call
your
honour
a
vulture
.
  
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
thought
of
compare
my
master
 
and
be
go
to
say
on
:
but
he
say
,
do
not
prate
,
girl
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
,
it
do
not
become
you
,
I
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
since
I
must
not
speak
,
I
will
hold
my
peace
;
but
there
be
a
righteous
Judge
,
who
know
the
secret
of
all
heart
;
and
to
him
I
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
see
there
!
<EOS>
say
he
:
now
this
meek
,
good
creature
be
pray
for
fire
from
heaven
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
o
she
can
curse
most
heartily
,
in
the
spirit
of
christian
meekness
,
I
will
assure
you
!
 
<EOS>
Come
,
saucy
-
face
,
give
me
another
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
do
,
as
well
as
I
could
;
but
weep
so
,
that
he
say
,
I
suppose
I
shall
have
some
of
your
tear
in
my
wine
!
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
sup
,
he
stand
up
,
and
say
,
o
how
happy
for
you
it
be
,
that
you
can
,
at
will
,
thus
make
your
speak
eye
overflow
in
this
manner
,
without
lose
any
of
their
brilliancy
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
be
tell
,
I
suppose
,
that
you
be
most
beautiful
in
your
tear
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
,
say
he
to
her
,
(
who
all
this
while
be
stand
in
one
corner
of
the
parlour
,
)
see
a
more
charming
creature
than
this
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
to
be
wonder
at
,
that
I
demean
myself
thus
to
take
notice
of
her
?
 
<EOS>
See
,
say
he
,
and
take
the
glass
with
one
hand
,
and
turn
me
round
with
the
other
,
what
a
shape
!
<EOS>
what
a
neck
!
<EOS>
what
a
hand
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
bloom
on
that
lovely
face
!
  
<EOS>
but
who
can
describe
the
trick
and
artifice
,
that
lie
lurk
in
her
little
,
plot
,
guileful
heart
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
no
wonder
the
poor
parson
be
infatuate
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
blame
him
less
than
I
do
her
;
for
who
could
expect
such
artifice
in
so
young
a
sorceress
?
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
farther
part
of
the
room
,
and
hold
my
face
against
the
wainscot
;
and
in
spite
of
all
I
could
do
to
refrain
crying
,
sob
as
if
my
heart
would
break
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
be
surprised
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
at
the
mistake
of
the
letter
you
tell
me
of
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
you
see
,
I
be
not
afraid
any
body
should
read
what
I
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
carry
on
private
correspondence
,
and
reveal
every
secret
that
come
to
my
knowledge
,
and
then
corrupt
people
to
carry
my
letter
against
their
duty
,
and
all
good
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
come
hither
,
hussy
!
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
a
dreadful
reckoning
to
make
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
come
,
when
I
bid
you
?
 
<EOS>
fie
upon
it
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
say
she
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
not
stir
,
when
his
honour
command
you
to
come
to
him
!
 
<EOS>
who
know
but
his
goodness
will
forgive
you
?
  
<EOS>
He
come
to
me
,
(
for
I
have
no
power
to
stir
,
)
and
put
his
arm
about
my
neck
,
and
would
kiss
me
;
and
say
,
<EOS>
well
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
if
it
be
not
for
the
thought
of
this
curse
parson
,
I
believe
in
my
heart
,
so
great
be
my
weakness
,
that
I
could
not
forgive
this
intriguing
little
slut
,
and
take
her
to
my
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
say
the
sycophant
,
you
be
very
good
,
sir
,
very
forgiving
,
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
but
come
,
add
the
profligate
wretch
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
be
so
good
,
as
to
take
her
to
your
bosom
;
and
that
,
by
to
-
morrow
morning
,
you
will
bring
her
to
a
well
sense
of
her
duty
!
  
<EOS>
Could
any
thing
in
womanhood
be
so
vile
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
:
but
yet
grief
and
indignation
choake
up
the
passage
of
my
word
;
and
I
could
only
stammer
out
a
passionate
exclamation
to
Heaven
,
to
protect
my
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
word
be
the
subject
of
their
ridicule
.
 
<EOS>
be
ever
poor
creature
<EOS>
bad
beset
!
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
as
if
he
have
be
consider
whether
he
could
forgive
me
or
not
,
no
,
I
can
not
yet
forgive
her
neither
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
give
me
great
disturbance
<EOS>
,
have
bring
great
discredit
upon
me
,
both
abroad
and
at
home
:
have
corrupt
all
my
servant
at
the
other
house
;
have
despise
my
honourable
view
and
intention
to
her
,
and
seek
to
run
away
with
this
ungrateful
parson
.
 
<EOS>
and
surely
I
ought
not
to
forgive
all
this
!
 
<EOS>
yet
,
with
all
this
wretched
grimace
,
he
kiss
me
again
,
and
would
have
put
his
hand
into
my
bosom
;
but
I
struggle
,
and
say
,
I
would
die
before
I
would
be
use
thus
.
 
<EOS>
consider
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
in
a
threaten
tone
,
consider
where
you
be
!
<EOS>
and
do
not
play
the
fool
:
if
you
do
,
a
more
dreadful
fate
await
you
than
you
expect
.
 
<EOS>
but
take
her
up
stair
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
I
will
send
a
few
line
to
her
to
consider
of
;
and
let
me
have
your
answer
,
Pamela
,
in
the

.
  
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
till
then
you
have
to
resolve
:
and
after
that
your
doom
be
fix
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
up
stair
,
and
give
myself
up
to
grief
,
and
expectation
of
what
he
would
send
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
be
glad
of
this
night
's
reprieve
!
  
<EOS>
He
send
me
,
however
,
nothing
at
all

about

Mrs.
Jewkes

Nan

up

as
the

at
sadly

Mrs.
Jewkes
rail
at
me
particularly

up
all

<EOS>
She

nothing

praise
him
,
and
blame
me

but
I
answer
her
as
little
as
I

that
the

Your
third
proposal
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
reject
for
the
same
reason
;
    
and
be
sorry
you
could
think
my
poor
honest
parent
would
enter
    
into
their
part
of
it
,
and
be
concern
for
the
management
of
    
an
estate
,
which
would
be
owe
to
the
prostitution
of
their
    
poor
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
,
sir
,
my
warmth
on
this
occasion
;
but
    
you
know
not
the
poor
man
,
and
the
poor
woman
,
my
ever
-
dear
    
father
and
mother
,
if
you
think
,
that
they
would
not
much
rather
    
choose
to
starve
in
a
ditch
,
or
rot
in
a
noisome
dungeon
,
than
    
accept
of
the
fortune
of
a
monarch
,
upon
such
wicked
term
.
    
<EOS>
I
dare
not
say
all
that
my
full
mind
suggest
to
me
on
this
    
grievous
occasion
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
sir
,
you
know
them
not
;
nor
    
shall
the
terror
of
death

its
most
frightful
form

I
hope

through
God

me
act
unworthy

such
poor
honest

Your

believe

I
think
    
such

Your

sir

your

your
ear

will
better
befit
lady
of
degree

to
lose
the

would
be
poorly
recompense
    
by

I
think

I
    
look

my
finger

see
in
the
glass
those
diamond

my
    
neck

in
my
ear

but
that
they
be
the
price
of
my
honesty

that
I
wear
those
jewel
outwardly

because
I
have
none

what
a

I

a

already

who
,
if
these

not
accept

shall
find
,
that
I
have
not
take
all
these
pain
,
and
risk
my
reputation
,
as
I
have
do
,
without
resolve
to
gratify
my
passion
for

I
know
all
the
resistance

can
make

be
poor

,
    
perhaps

stand
me
in
little
stead

I
dread
your

great

will
I

all

your

the

nothing
    
to
reproach
myself

all

avoid
my
    
disgrace

then
I
can
safely
appeal
to
the
great
God

my
only
    
refuge

this
consolation

happy

I
have
not
once
dare
to
look
so
high
,
as
to
such
a
    
proposal
as
your
seventh
article
contain
.
 
<EOS>
hence
have
proceed
    
all
my
little
abortive
artifice
to
escape
from
the
confinement
    
you
have
put
me
in
;
although
you
promise
to
be
honourable
to
me
.
    
<EOS>
Your
honour
,
well
I
know
,
would
not
let
you
stoop
to
<EOS>
so
mean
and
    
so
unworthy
<EOS>
a
slave
,
as
the
poor
Pamela
:
all
I
desire
be
,
to
be
    
permit
to
return
to
my
native
meanness
unviolated
.
 
<EOS>
what
have
    
<EOS>
I
do
,
sir
,
to
deserve
it
<EOS>
should
be
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
for
the
obtain
    
of
this
,
though
I
would
not
have
marry
your
chaplain
,
yet
would
    
I
have
run
away
with
your
mean
servant
,
if
I
have
think
I
could
    
have
get
safe
to
my
beloved
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
you
once
say
,
sir
,
    
that
a
certain
great
commander
,
who
could
live
upon
lentil
,
may
    
well
refuse
the
bribe
of
the
great
monarch
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
as
I
    
can
contentedly
live
at
the
mean
rate
,
and
think
not
myself
    
above
the
low
condition
,
that
I
be
also
above
make
an
exchange
    
of
my
honesty
for
all
the
rich
of
the
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
be
    
proud
and
vain
of
gaudy
apparel
,
and
outside
finery
,
then
(
which
I
    
hope
will
never
be
)
<EOS>
may
I
rest
my
principal
good
in
such
vain
    
trinket
,
and
despise
for
them
the
more
solid
ornament
of
a
good
    
fame
,
and
a
chastity
inviolate
!
  
<EOS>
give
me
leave
to
say
,
sir
,
in
answer
to
what
you
hint
,
that
you
may
in
a
twelvemonth
's
time
marry
me
,
on
the
continuance
of
my
good
behaviour
;
that
this
weigh
less
with
me
,
if
possible
,
than
any
thing
else
you
have
say
:
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
there
be
an
end
of
all
merit
,
and
all
good
behaviour
,
on
my
side
,
if
I
have
now
any
,
the
moment
I
consent
to
your
proposal
:
and
I
should
be
so
far
from
expect
such
an
honour
,
that
I
will
pronounce
,
that
I
should
be
most
unworthy
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
sir
,
would
the
world
say
,
be
you
to
marry
your
harlot
?
 
<EOS>
that
a
gentleman
of
your
rank
in
life
should
stoop
,
not
only
to
the
base
-
bear
Pamela
,
but
to
a
base
-
bear
prostitute
?
 
<EOS>
Little
,
sir
,
as
I
know
of
the
world
,
I
be
not
to
be
catch
by
a
bait
so
poorly
cover
as
this
!
  
<EOS>
yet
,
after
all
,
dreadful
be
the
thought
,
that
I
,
a
poor
,
weak
,
friendless
,
unhappy
creature
,
be
too
full
in
your
power
!
 
<EOS>
but
permit
me
,
sir
,
to
pray
,
as
I
now
write
on
my
bended
knee
,
that
before
you
resolve
upon
my
ruin
,
you
will
weigh
well
the
matter
.

Hitherto
,
sir

though
you
have
take
large
stride
to
this
cry
sin

yet
be
you
on
this
side
the
commission
of
it

when
once

do

nothing
can
recall
it

and
where
will
be
your
triumph

<EOS>
what
glory
will
the
spoil
of
such
a
weak
enemy
yield
you
?

let
me
but
enjoy
my
poverty
with
honesty

be
all
my
prayer
,
and
I
will
bless
you

and
pray
for

every

of
my
life

think
,
o
think
!
<EOS>
before
it
be
yet
too
late
!
<EOS>
what
sting
,
what
remorse
will
attend
your
die
hour
,
when
you
come
to
reflect
,
that
you
have
ruin
,
perhaps
soul
and
body
,
a
wretched
creature
,
whose
only
pride
be
her
virtue
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
pleased
you
will
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
if
in
that
tremendous
moment
you
shall
be
able
to
acquit
yourself
of
this
foul
crime
,
and
to
plead
in
your
own
behalf
,
that
you
suffer
the
earnest
supplication
of
an
unhappy
wretch
to
prevail
with
you
to
be
innocent
yourself
,
and
let
her
remain
so

May
God

so
lately

peril
of
perish
in
deep
water
,

I.
 
I

<EOS>
You

<EOS>

do
it
if
the
vulture

part
,
and
bid
the
poor
innocent
lamb

silent
!
 
<EOS>
ay

say
I
,
no
matter

your
fleer

Mrs.
Jewkes
;
though
I
can
have
neither
justice
nor
mercy
here
,
and
can
not
be
hear
in
my
defence
,
yet
a
time
will
come
,
may
be
,
when
I
shall
be
hear
,
and
when
your
own
guilt
will
strike
you
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
ay

say
she
;
and
the
vulture
too
!
 
<EOS>
Must
we
both
be
dumb
?
 
<EOS>
why
that
,
lambkin
,
will
be
pretty
!
 
<EOS>
then
,
say
the
wicked
one
<EOS>
,
you
will
have
all
the
talk
to
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
then
how
will
the
tongue
of
the
pretty
lambkin
bleat
out
innocence
,
and
virtue
,
and
honesty
,
till
the
whole
trial
be
at
an
end
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
wicked
woman
<EOS>
,
that
be
certain
,
say
I
;
and
if
you
think
any
thing
of
another
world
,

not

thus
.
 
<EOS>
but

wonder
!
 
<EOS>
It

so

,
say
she
;
but
I
beg
you
will
undress
,
and
come
to
bed
,
or
I
believe
your
innocence
will
not
keep
you
from
still
bad
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
come
to
bed
,
say
I
,
if
you
will
let
me
have
the
key
in
my
own
hand
;
not
else
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
yes
,
say
she
,
and
<EOS>
then
,
hey
for
another
contrivance
,
another
escape
!
  
<EOS>
no

say
I
,
<EOS>
all
my
contrivance
be
over
,
I
will
assure
you

<EOS>
Pray
let
me
have
the
key
,
and
I
will
come
to

.
 
<EOS>
She
come
to
me
,
and
take
me
in
her
huge
arm
,
as
if
I
be
a
feather
:
<EOS>
say
she
,
I
do
this
to
shew
you
what
a
poor
resistance
<EOS>
you
can
make
against
me
,
if
I
please
to
exert
myself
;
and
so
,
lambkin
,
do
not
say
to
your
wolf
,
I
will
not
come
to
bed
!
  
<EOS>
and
set
me
down
,
and
tap
me
on
the
neck
:
<EOS>
ah
!
say
she
,
thou
art
a
pretty
creature
,
'
tis
true
;
but
so
obstinate
!
<EOS>
so
full
of
spirit
!
<EOS>
if
thy
strength
be
but
answerable
to
that
,
thou
would'st
run
away
with
us
all
,
and
this
great
house
too
on
thy
back
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
undress
,
undress
,
I
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
I
see
my
misfortune
make
you
very
merry
,
and
very
witty
too
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
love
you
,
if
you
will
humour
me
with
the
key
of
the
chamber
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
sure
you
will
love
me
?
<EOS>
say
she
:
now
speak
your
conscience
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
you
must
not
put
it
so
close
;
<EOS>
neither
would
you
,
if
you
think
you
have
not
give
reason
to
doubt
it
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
love
you
as
well
as
I
can
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
a
wilful
lie
:
and
if
I
do
,
you
would
not
believe
me
,
after
your
hard
usage
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
that
be
all
fair
,
I
own
!
 
<EOS>
but
Nan
,
pray
pull
off
my
young
lady
's
shoe
and
stocking
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
pray
do
not
,
say
I
;
I
will
come
to
bed
presently
,
since
I
must
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
I
go
to
the
closet
,
and
scribble
a
little
about
this
idle
chit
-
chat
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
importunate
,
I
be
force
to
go
to
bed
;
but
with
some
of
my
clothe
on
,
as
the
former
night
;
and
she
let
me
hold
the
two
key
;
for
there
be
two
lock
,
there
be
a
double
door
;
and
so
I
get
a
little
sleep
that
night
,
have
have
none
for
two
or
three
night
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
what
she
mean
;
but
Nan
offer
to
talk
a
little
once
or
twice
;
and
she
snub
her
,
and
say
,
I
charge
you
,
wench
,
do
not
open
your
lip
before
me
;
and
if
you
be
ask
any
question
by
Mrs.
Pamela
,
do
not
answer
her
one
word
,
while
I
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
a
lordly
woman
to
the
maid
-
servant
;
and
that
have
always
be
her
character
:
<EOS>
o
how
unlike
good
Mrs.
Jervis
in
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
a
thought
come
into
my
head
;
I
mean
no
harm
;
but
it
be
a
little
bold
.
<EOS>
for
,
see
my
master
dress
to
go
to
church
;
and
his
chariot
get
ready
,
I
go
to
my
closet
,
and
I
writ
,
      
<EOS>
the
prayer
of
this
congregation
be
earnestly
desire
for
a
    
gentleman
of
great
worth
and
honour
,
who
labour
under
a
temptation
    
to
exert
his
great
power
to
ruin
a
poor
,
distressed
,
worthless
    
maiden
:
      
<EOS>
and
also
,
      
the
prayer
of
this
congregation
be
earnestly
desire
by
a
poor
    
distressed
creature
,
for
the
preservation
of
her
virtue
and
    
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
up
:
always
write
!
<EOS>
say
she
;
and
would
see
it
:
<EOS>
and
strait
,
<EOS>
all
that
ever
I
could
say
,
carry
it
down
to
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
upon
it
,
and
say
,
tell
her
,
she
shall
soon
see
how
her
prayer
be
answer
;
she
be
very
bold
:
<EOS>
but
as
she
have
reject
all
my
favour
,
her
reckon
for
all
be
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
after
him
out
of
the
window
;
and
he
be
charmingly
dress
:
<EOS>
to
be
sure
he
be
a
handsome
fine
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
what
pity
his
heart
be
not
as
good
as
his
appearance
!
 
<EOS>
why
can
not
I
hate
him
?
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
be
uneasy
,
if
you
should
see
this
;
for
it
be
impossible
I
should
love
him
;
for
his
vice
all
ugly
him
over
,
as
I
may
say
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
send
word
,
that
he
shall
not
come
home
to
dinner
:
I
suppose
he
dine
with
this
Sir
Simon
Darnford
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
concerned
for
poor
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
he
be
confine
still
,
and
take
on
much
.
<EOS>
all
his
trouble
be
bring
upon
him
for
my
sake
:
this
grieve
me
much
.
<EOS>
My
master
,
it
seem
,
will
have
his
money
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
hard
;
for
it
be
three
fifty
pound
,
he
give
him
,
as
he
think
,
as
a
salary
for
three
year
that
he
have
be
with
him
:
but
there
be
no
agreement
between
them
;
and
he
absolutely
depend
on
my
master
's
favour
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
it
be
the
more
generous
of
him
to
run
these
risk
for
the
sake
of
oppress
innocence
:
and
I
hope
he
will
meet
with
his
reward
in
due
time
.
 
<EOS>
alas
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
plead
for
him
;
that
would
raise
my
oppressor
's
jealousy
more
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
not
interest
to
save
myself
!
  
<EOS>
Sunday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
receive
a
line
from
my
master
:
I
wonder
what
it
be
,
for
his
chariot
be
come
home
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
will
tell
me
nothing
;
<EOS>
so
it
be
in
vain
to
ask
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
fearful
of
plot
and
trick
,
I
know
not
what
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
every
thing
I
suspect
;
for
,
now

avow
,
what
can
I
think
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
the
bad
will
be

!
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
pour
out
my
soul
in
prayer
to
God
,
for
his
bless
protection
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
must
suffer
,
let
me
not
be
long
a
mournful
survivor
!
 
<EOS>
only
let
me
not

would

I

loveliness

that
.
 
<EOS>
why
sure
,
say
she
,
if
you
have
,
you
would
not
have
offer
to
read
my
letter
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
I
should
,
at
this
time
,
if
it
have
be
in
my
way
:
 
do
let
me
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
<EOS>
,
I
wish
poor
Mr.
Williams
well
off
<EOS>
:
I
understand
my
master
be
go
to
make
up
matter
with
him
;
which
be
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
add
she
,
he
be
a
very
good
gentleman
,
and
very
forgiving
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
as
if
I
have
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
how
can
he
make
up
matter
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
Mr.
Williams
at
Stamford
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
she
,
I
believe
so
;
but
Parson
Peters
plead
for
him
,
and
he
be
go
with
him
to
Stamford
,
and
will
not
be
back
to
-
night
:
so
we
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
eat
our
supper
betime
,
and
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
that
be
pure
,
say
I
;
and
I
shall
have
good
rest
this
night
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
say
she
,
you
may
every
night
,
but
for
your
own
idle
fear
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
afraid
of
your
friend
,
when
none
be
near
you
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
that
be
true
,
say
I
;
for
I
have
not
one
near
me
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
have
one
more
good
honest
night
before
me
:
<EOS>
what
the
next
may
be
I
know
not
,
and
so
I
will
try
to
take
in
a
good
deal
of
sleep
,
while
I
can
be
a
little
easy
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
here
I
say
,
good
night
,
my
dear
parent
;
for
I
have
no
more
to
write
about
this
night
:
and
though
his
letter
shock
me
,
yet
I
will
be
as
brisk
as
I
can
,
that
she
may
not
suspect
I
have
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
night
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
future
,
I
will
always
mistrust
most
when
appearance
look
fairest
.
 
<EOS>
o
your
poor
daughter
!
<EOS>
what
have
she
not
suffer
since
what
I
write
on
Sunday
night
!
 
<EOS>
My
bad
trial
,
and
my
fearfull
danger
!
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
shudder
to
write
you
an
account
of
this
wicked
interval
of
time
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
my
dear
parent
,
will
you
not
be
too
much
frightened
and
affect
with
my
distress
,
when
I
tell
you
,
that
his
journey
to
Stamford
be
all
abominable
pretence
!
<EOS>
for
he
come
home
privately
,
and
have
well
nigh
effect
all
his
vile
purpose
,
and
the
ruin
of
your
poor
daughter
!
<EOS>
and
that
by
such
a
plot
as
I
be
not
in
the
least
apprehensive
of
:
<EOS>
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
you
will
hear
what
a
vile
and
unwomanly
part
that
wicked
wretch
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
act
in
it
!
  
<EOS>
I
leave
off
with
let
you
know
how
much
I
be
pleased
that
I
have
<EOS>
one
night
's
reprieve
add
to
my
honesty
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
less
occasion
to
rejoice
than
ever
,
as
you
will
judge
by
what
I
have
say
already
.
 
<EOS>
take
,
then
,
<EOS>
the
dreadful
story
,
as
well
as
I
can
relate
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
maid
Nan
be
a
little
apt
to
drink
,
if
she
can
get
at
liquor
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
happen
,
or
design
,
as
be
too
probable
,
to
leave
a
bottle
of
cherry
-
brandy
in
her
way
,
and
the
wench
drink
some
of
it
more
than
she
should
;
and
when
she
come
in
to
lay
the
cloth
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
perceive
it
,
and
fall
a
rating
at
her
most
sadly
;
for
she
have
too
many
fault
of
her
own
,
to
suffer
any
of
the
like
sort
in
any
body
else
,
if
she
can
help
it
;
and
she
bid
her
get
out
of
her
sight
,
when
we
have
sup
,
and
go
to
bed
,
to
sleep
off
her
liquor
,
before
we
come
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
the
poor
maid
go
mutter
up
stair
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
hour
after
,
which
be
near
eleven
o'clock
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
I
go
up
to
go
to
bed
;
I
please
myself
with
what
a
charming
night
I
should
have
.
 
<EOS>
We
lock
both
door
,
and
see
poor
Nan
,
as
I
think
,
(
<EOS>
but
,
oh
!
'
twas
my
abominable
master
,
as
you
shall
hear
by
and
by
,
)
sit
fast
asleep
,
in
an
elbow
-
chair
,
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
,
with
her
apron
throw
over
her
head
and
neck
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
there
be
that
beast
of
a
wench
fast
asleep
,
instead
of
be
a
-
bed
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
say
she
,
she
have
take
a
fine
dose
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
wake
her
,
say
I.
 
no
,
<EOS>
do
not
,
say
she
;
let
her
sleep
on
;
we
shall
he
better
without
her
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
I
,
so
we
shall
;
but
will
not
she
get
cold
?
  
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
have
no
writing
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
reply
I
,
I
will
go
to
bed
with
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
what
you
can
find
to
write
about
so
much
!
<EOS>
and
be
sure
you
have
well
convenience
of
that
kind
,
and
more
paper
than
I
be
aware
of
;
and
I
have
intend
to
rummage
you
,
if
my
master
have
not
come
down
;
for
I
spy
a
broken
tea
-
cup
with
ink
,
which
give
me
suspicion
:
but
as
he
be
come
,
let
him
look
after
you
,
if
he
will
;
and
if
you
deceive
him
,
it
will
be
his
own
fault
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
we
be
undress
ourselves
:
<EOS>
and
I
fetch
a
deep
sigh
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
sigh
for
?
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
think
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
answer
I
,
what
a
sad
life
I
live
,
and
<EOS>
how
hard
be
my
lot
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
the
thief
that
have
rob
be
much
well
off
than
I
,
"
bate
the
guilt
;
and
I
should
,
I
think
,
take
it
for
a
mercy
,
to
be
hang
out
of
the
way
,
rather
than
live
in
these
cruel
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
be
not
sleepy
,
and
in
a
prattle
vein
,
I
begin
to
give
a
little
history
of
myself
,
as
I
do
,
once
before
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
;
in
this
manner
:
  
here
,
say
I
,
be
my
poor
honest
parent
;
they
take
care
to
instill
good
principle
into
my
mind
,
till
I
be
almost
twelve
year
of
age
;
and
teach
me
to
prefer
goodness
and
poverty
to
the
high
condition
of
life
;
and
they
confirm
their
lesson
by
their
own
practice
;
for
they
be
,
of
late
year
,
remarkably
poor
,
and
always
as
remarkably
honest
,
even
to
a
proverb
:
for
,
as
honest
as
goodman
ANDREWS
,
be
a
byeword
.
  
<EOS>
well
then
,
say
I
,
come
my
late
dear
good
lady
,
and
take
a
fancy
to
me
,
and
say
,
she
would
be
the
making
of
me
,
if
I
be
a
good
girl
;
and
she
put
me
to
sing
,
to
dance
,
to
play
on
the
spinnet
,
in
order
to
divert
her
melancholy
hour
;
and
also
teach
me
all
manner
of
fine
needle
-
work
;
but
still
this
be
her
lesson
,
My
good
Pamela
,
be
virtuous
,
and
keep
the
man
at
a
distance
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
so
I
be
,
I
hope
,
and
so
I
do
;
and
yet
,
though
I
say
it
,
they
all
love
me
and
respect
me
;
and
would
do
any
thing
for
me
,
as
if
I
be
a
gentlewoman
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
then
,
what
come
next
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
it
please
God
to
take
my
good
lady
:
and
then
come
my
master
:
<EOS>
and
what
say
he
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
in
effect
,
it
be
,
be
not
virtuous
,
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
so
here
I
have
live
about
sixteen
year
in
virtue
and
reputation
;
and
all
at
once
,
when
I
come
to
know
what
be
good
,
and
what
be
evil
,
I
must
renounce
all
the
good
,
all
the
whole
sixteen
year
'
innocence
,
which
,
next
to
God
's
grace
,
I
owe
chiefly
to
my
parent
,
and
my
lady
's
good
lesson
and
example
,
and
choose
the
evil
;
and
so
,
in
a
moment
's
time
,
become
the
vilest
of
creature
!
 
<EOS>
and
all
this
,
for
what
,
I
pray
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
truly
,
for
a
pair
of
diamond
ear
-
ring
,
a
necklace
,
and
a
diamond
ring
for
my
finger
;
which
would
not
become
me
:
for
a
few
paltry
fine
clothe
,
which
,
when
I
wear
them
,
would
make
but
my
former
poverty
more
ridiculous
to
every
body
that
see
me
;
especially
when
they
know
the
base
term
I
wear
them
upon
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
I
be
to
have
a
great
parcel
of
guinea
beside
;
I
forget
how
many
;
for
,
have
there
be
ten
time
more
<EOS>
,
they
would
have
be
not
so
much
to
me
,
as
the
honest
six
guinea
you
trick
me
out
of
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
but
then
I
be
to
have
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
many
pound
a
year
for
my
life
;
and
my
poor
father
<EOS>
(
there
be
the
jest
of
it
!
)
<EOS>
be
to
be
the
manager
for
the
abandon
prostitute
his
daughter
:
<EOS>
and
then
,
(
there
be
the
jest
again
!
)
<EOS>
my
kind
,
forgiving
,
virtuous
master
,
would
pardon
me
all
my
misdeed
!
  
<EOS>
yes
,
thank
him
for
nothing
,
truly
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
,
pray
,
be
all
these
violent
misdeed
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
they
be
for
dare
to
adhere
to
the
good
lesson
that
be
teach
me
;
and
not
learn
a
new
one
,
that
would
have
reverse
all
my
former
:
for
not
be
content
when
I
be
run
away
with
,
in
order
to
be
ruin
;
but
contrive
,
if
my
poor
wit
have
be
able
,
to
get
out
of
danger
,
and
preserve
myself
honest
.
  
<EOS>
then
be
he
once
jealous
of
poor
John
,
though
he
know
John
be
his
own
creature
,
and
help
to
deceive
me
.
  
<EOS>
then
be
he
outrageous
against
poor
Parson
Williams
!
<EOS>
and
him
have
this
good
,
merciful
master
,
throw
into
gaol
;
and
for
what
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
truly
,
for
that
,
be
a
divine
,
and
a
good
man
,
he
have
the
fear
of
God
before
his
eye
,
and
be
willing
to
forego
all
his
expectation
of
interest
,
and
assist
an
oppress
poor
creature
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
to
be
sure
,
I
must
be
forward
,
bold
,
saucy
,
and
what
<EOS>
not
!
<EOS>
to
dare
to
run
away
from
certain
ruin
,
and
to
strive
to
escape
from
an
unjust
confinement
;
and
I
must
be
marry
to
the
parson
,
nothing
so
sure
!
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
have
but
a
poor
catch
of
me
,
have
I
consent
:
<EOS>
but
he
,
and
you
too
,
know
I
do
not
want
to
marry
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
want
to
go
to
my
poor
parent
,
and
to
have
my
own
liberty
,
and
not
to
be
confine
by
such
an
unlawful
restraint
;
and
which
would
not
have
be
inflict
upon
me
,
but
only
that
I
be
a
poor
,
destitute
,
young
body
,
and
have
no
friend
that
be
able
to
right
me
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
here
be
my
history
in
brief
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
a
very
unhappy
young
creature
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
and
why
be
I
so
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
because
my
master
see
something
in
my
person
that
take
his
present
fancy
;
and
because
I
would
not
be
undo
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
therefore
to
choose
,
I
must
,
and
I
shall
be
undo
!
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
all
the
reason
that
can
be
give
!
  
<EOS>
She
hear
me
run
on
all
this
time
,
while
I
be
undress
,
without
any
interruption
;
and
I
say
,
well
,
I
must
go
to
the
two
closet
,
ever
since
an
affair
of
the
closet
at
the
other
house
,
though
he
be
so
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
a
good
mind
to
wake
this
poor
maid
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
do
not
,
say
she
,
I
charge
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
angry
with
her
,
and
she
will
get
no
harm
there
;
and
if
she
wake
,
she
may
come
to
bed
well
enough
,
as
long
as
there
be
a
candle
in
the
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
look
into
the
closet
,
and
kneel
down
in
my
own
,
as
I
use
to
do
,
to
say
my
prayer
,
and
this
with
my
underclothe
in
my
hand
,
all
undressed
;
and
pass
by
the
poor
sleeping
wench
,
as
I
think
,
in
my
return
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
!
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
do
I
think
it
be
my
wicked
,
wicked
master
,
in
a
gown
and
petticoat
of
hers
,
and
her
apron
over
his
face
and
shoulder
.
<EOS>
what
meanness
will
not
Lucifer
make
his
votary
stoop
to
,
to
gain
their
abominable
end
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
by
this
time
,
be
get
to
bed
,
on
the
farther
side
,
as
she
use
to
be
;
and
,
to
make
room
for
the
maid
,
when
she
should
awake
,
I
get
into
bed
,
and
lie
close
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
where
be
the
key
?
<EOS>
though
,
say
I
,
I
be
not
so
much
afraid
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
say
the
wicked
woman
,
put
your
arm
under
mine
,
and
you
shall
find
them
about
my
wrist
,
as
they
use
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
do
,
and
the
abominable
designer
hold
my
hand
with
her
right
-
hand
,
as
my
right
-
arm
be
under
her
left
.
  
<EOS>
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
I
say
,
there
be
poor
Nan
awake
;
I
hear
her
stir
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
go
to
sleep
,
say
she
,
and
not
mind
her
:
she
will
come
to
bed
,
when
she
be
quite
awake
.
 
<EOS>
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
I
will
warrant
she
will
have
the
head
-
ache
finely
to
-
morrow
for
this
!
 
<EOS>
be
silent
,
say
she
,
and
go
to
sleep
;
you
keep
me
awake
;
and
I
never
find
you
in
so
talkative
a
humour
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
chide
me
,
say
I
;
<EOS>
I
will
but
say
one
thing
more
:
do
you
think
Nan
could
hear
me
talk
of
my
master
's
offer
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
say
she
;
she
be
dead
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
that
,
say
I
;
because
I
would
not
expose
my
master
to
his
common
servant
;
and
I
know
you
be
no
stranger
to
his
fine
article
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
I
think
they
be
fine
article
,
and
you
be
bewitch
you
do
not
close
with
them
:
but
let
us
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
silent
;
and
the
pretended
Nan
(
o
wicked
,
base
,
villanous
designer
!
<EOS>
what
a
plot
,
what
an
unexpected
plot
be
this
!
)
seem
to
be
awake
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
abhorrent
creature
!
<EOS>
say
,
come
,
Nan
!
 
<EOS>
what
,
be
you
awake
at
last
?
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
come
to
bed
;
for
Mrs.
Pamela
be
in
a
talk
fit
,
and
will
not
go
to
sleep
one
while
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
,
the
pretend
<EOS>
she
come
to
the
bed
side
;
and
,
sit
down
in
a
chair
,
where
the
curtain
hide
her
,
begin
to
undress
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
,
Poor
Mrs.
Anne
<EOS>
,
I
warrant
your
head
ache
most
sadly
!
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
?
  
<EOS>
say
he
,
one
word
with
you
,
Pamela
;
one
word
hear
me
<EOS>
but
;
I
must
say
one
word
to
you
<EOS>
,
it
be
this
:
<EOS>
You
see
now
you
be
in
my
power
!
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
get
from
me
,
nor
help
yourself
:
<EOS>
yet
have
I
not
offer
any
thing
amiss
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
resolve
not
to
comply
with
my
proposal
,
I
will
not
lose
this
opportunity
:
if
you
do
,
I
will
yet
leave
you
.
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
leave
me
,
leave
me
<EOS>
but
,
and
I
will
do
any
thing
I
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Swear
then
to
me
<EOS>
,
say
he
,
that
you
will
accept
my
proposal
!
 
<EOS>
with
struggle
,
fright
,
terror
,
I
faint
away
quite
,
and
do
not
come
to
myself
soon
,
so
that
they
both
,
from
the
cold
sweat
that
I
be
in
,
think
me
die
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
remember
no
more
,
than
that
,
when
with
great
difficulty
they
bring
me
to
myself
<EOS>
,
she
be
sit
on
one
side
of
the
bed
,
with
her
clothe
on
;
and
he
on
the
other
with
his
,
and
in
his
gown
and
slipper
.
  
<EOS>
Your
poor
Pamela
can
not
answer
for
the
liberty
take
with
her
in
her
deplorable
state
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
see
them
there
,
I
sit
up
in
my
bed
,
without
any
regard
to
what
appearance
I
make
,
and
nothing
about
my
neck
;
and
he
soothe
me
,
with
an
aspect
of
pity
and
concern
,
I
put
my
hand
to
his
mouth
,
and
say
,
o
tell
me
,
yet
tell
me
not
,
what
have
I
suffer
in
this
distress
?
 
<EOS>
and
I
talk
quite
wild
,
and
know
not
what
:
for
,
to
be
sure
<EOS>
,
I
be
on
the
point
of
distraction
.
  
<EOS>
He
most
solemnly
,
and
with
a
bitter
imprecation
,
vow
,
that
he
have
not
offer
the
least
indecency
;
that
he
be
frightened
at
the
terrible
manner
I
be
take
with
the
fit
:
that
he
should
desist
from
his
attempt
;
and
beg
but
to
see
me
easy
and
quiet
,
and
he
would
leave
me
directly
,
and
go
to
his
own
bed
.
 
<EOS>
o
then
,
say
I
,
take
with
you
this
most
wicked
woman
,
this
vile
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
as
an
earnest
,
that
I
may
believe
you
!
  
<EOS>
and
will
you
,
sir
,
say
the
wicked
wretch
,
for
a
fit
or
two
,
give
up
such
an
opportunity
as
this
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
know
the
sex
better
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
now
,
you
see
,
quite
well
again
!
  
<EOS>
this
I
hear
<EOS>
;
more
she
may
say
;
but
I
faint
away
once
more
,
at
these
word
,
and
at
his
clasp
his
arm
about
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
when
I
come
a
little
to
myself
,
I
see
him
sit
there
,
and
the
maid
Nan
,
hold
a
smelling
-
bottle
to
my
nose
,
and
no
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
take
my
hand
<EOS>
,
now
will
I
vow
to
you
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
that
I
will
leave
you
the
moment
I
see
you
better
,
and
pacify
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
Nan
know
,
and
will
tell
you
,
my
concern
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
vow
to
God
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
offer
any
indecency
to
you
:
and
,
since
I
find
Mrs.
Jewkes
so
offensive
to
you
,
I
have
send
her
to
the
maid
's
bed
,
and
the
maid
shall
be
with
you
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
and
but
promise
me
,
that
you
will
compose
yourself
,
and
I
will
leave
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
I
,
will
not
Nan
also
hold
my
hand
?
 
<EOS>
and
will
not
she
let
you
come
in
again
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
by
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
come
in
again
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Nan
,
undress
yourself
,
go
to
bed
,
and
do
all
you
can
to
comfort
the
dear
creature
:
<EOS>
and
now
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
give
me
but
your
hand
,
and
say
you
forgive
me
,
and
I
will
leave
you
to
your
repose
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
out
my
tremble
hand
,
which
he
vouchsafe
to
kiss
;
and
<EOS>
I
say
,
God
forgive
you
,
sir
,
as
you
have
be
just
in
my
distress
;
and
as
you
will
be
just
to
what
you
promise
!
 
<EOS>
and
he
withdraw
,
with
a
countenance
of
remorse
,
as
I
hope
;
and
she
shut
the
door
,
and
,
at
my
request
,
bring
the
key
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
o
my
dear
parent
!
<EOS>
be
a
most
dreadful
trial
.
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
still
to
think
of
it
;
and
dare
not
recall
all
the
horrid
circumstance
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
as
he
assure
me
,
he
be
not
guilty
of
indecency
;
but
have
reason
to
bless
God
,
who
,
by
disable
me
in
my
faculty
,
empower
me
to
preserve
my
innocence
;
and
,
when
all
my
strength
would
have
signify
nothing
,
magnify
himself
in
my
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
weak
all
day
on
Monday
,
that
I
could
not
get
out
of
my
bed
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
shew
great
tenderness
for
me
;
and
I
hope
he
be
really
sorry
,
and
that
this
will
be
his
last
attempt
;
but
he
do
not
say
so
neither
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
in
the
morning
,
as
soon
as
he
hear
the
door
open
and
I
begin
to
be
fearful
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
short
of
the
bed
,
and
say
,
rather
than
give
you
apprehension
,
I
will
come
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
Your
honour
,
sir
,
and
your
mercy
,
be
all
I
have
to
beg
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
himself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
ask
kindly
,
how
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
beg
me
to
be
compose
;
say
,
I
still
look
a
little
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
pray
,
good
sir
,
let
me
not
see
this
infamous
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
I
doubt
I
can
not
bear
her
sight
.
 
<EOS>
She
shall
not
come
near
you
all
this
day
,
if
you
will
promise
to
compose
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
I
will
try
.
 
<EOS>
He
press
my
hand
very
tenderly
,
and
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
change
do
this
shew
!
 
<EOS>
o
may
it
be
last
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
seem
only
to
have
alter
his
method
of
proceeding
;
and
retain
,
I
doubt
,
his
wicked
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
on
Tuesday
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
when
my
master
hear
I
be
up
,
he
send
for
me
down
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
see
me
,
he
say
,
come
near
to
me
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
and
he
take
my
hand
,
and
say
,
You
begin
to
look
well
again
:
I
be
glad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
little
slut
,
how
do
you
frighten
me
on
Sunday
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
pray
name
not
that
night
;
and
my
eye
overflow
at
the
remembrance
,
and
I
turn
my
head
aside
.
  
<EOS>
say
he
,
place
some
little
confidence
in
me
:
<EOS>
I
know
what
those
charming
eye
mean
,
and
you
shall
not
need
to
explain
yourself
:
for
I
do
assure
you
,
that
as
soon
as
I
see
you
change
,
and
a
cold
sweat
bedew
<EOS>
your
pretty
face
,
and
you
faint
away
<EOS>
,
I
quit
the
bed
,
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
do
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
put
on
my
gown
,
and
she
fetch
her
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
we
both
do
all
we
could
to
restore
you
;
and
my
passion
for
you
be
all
swallow
up
in
the
concern
I
have
for
your
recovery
;
for
I
think
I
never
see
a
fit
so
strong
and
violent
in
my
life
:
and
fear
we
should
not
bring
you
to
life
again
;
for
what
I
see
you
in
once
before
be
nothing
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
say
he
,
may
be
my
folly
,
and
my
unacquaintedness
with
what
passion
<EOS>
your
sex
can
shew
when
they
be
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
I
repeat
to
you
,
that
your
mind
may
be
entirely
comfort
 
whatever
I
offer
to
you
<EOS>
,
be
before
you
faint
away
,
and
that
,
I
be
sure
,
be
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
that
be
very
bad
:
and
it
be
too
plain
you
have
the
bad
design
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
say
he
,
I
tell
you
the
truth
in
one
instance
,
you
may
believe
me
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
,
I
declare
,
beyond
this
lovely
bosom
,
your
sex
:
but
that
I
do
intend
what
you
call
the
bad
<EOS>
be
most
certain
:
and
though
I
would
not
too
much
alarm
you
now
,
I
could
curse
my
weakness
,
and
my
folly
,
which
make
me
own
,
that
I
love
you
beyond
all
your
sex
,
and
can
not
live
without
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
master
of
myself
,
and
my
own
resolution
,
I
will
not
attempt
to
force
you
to
any
thing
again
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
may
easily
keep
your
resolution
,
if
you
will
send
me
out
of
your
way
,
to
my
poor
parent
;
that
be
all
I
beg
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
a
folly
to
talk
of
it
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
,
shall
not
go
!
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
could
be
assure
you
would
not
attempt
it
,
you
should
have
well
usage
,
and
your
confinement
should
be
make
easy
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
what
end
,
sir
,
be
I
to
stay
?
<EOS>
say
I
:
<EOS>
You
yourself
seem
not
sure
you
can
keep
your
own
present
good
resolution
;
and
do
you
think
,
if
I
be
to
stay
,
when
I
could
get
away
,
and
be
safe
,
it
would
not
look
,
as
if
either
I
confide
too
much
in
my
own
strength
,
or
would
tempt
my
ruin
?
<EOS>
and
as
if
I
be
not
in
earnest
to
wish
myself
safe
,
and
out
of
danger
?
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
how
long
be
I
to
stay
?
 
<EOS>
and
to
what
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
and
in
what
light
must
I
appear
to
the
world
?
 
<EOS>
Would
not
that
censure
me
,
although
I
may
be
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
allow
,
sir
,
that
,
if
there
be
any
thing
valuable
or
exemplary
in
a
good
name
,
or
fair
reputation
,
one
must
not
despise
the
world
's
censure
,
if
one
can
avoid
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
I
send
not
for
you
on
this
account
,
just
now
;
but
for
two
reason
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
that
you
promise
me
,
that
for
a
fortnight
to
come
you
will
not
offer
to
go
away
without
my
express
consent
;
and
this
I
expect
for
your
own
sake
,
that
I
may
give
you
a
little
more
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
second
be
,
that
you
will
see
and
forgive
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
:
she
take
on
much
,
and
think
that
,
as
all
her
fault
be
her
obedience
to
me
,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
sacrifice
her
,
as
she
call
it
,
to
your
resentment
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
first
,
sir
,
say
I
,
it
be
a
hard
injunction
,
for
the
reason
I
have
mention
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
second
,
consider
her
vile
,
unwomanly
wickedness
,
and
her
endeavour
to
instigate
you
more
to
ruin
me
,
when
your
return
goodness
seem
to
have
some
compassion
upon
me
,
it
be
still
hard
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
shew
my
obedience
to
your
command
,
(
for
you
know
,
my
dear
parent
,
I
may
as
well
make
a
merit
of
my
compliance
,
when
my
refusal
would
stand
me
in
no
stead
,
)
I
will
consent
to
both
;
and
to
every
thing
else
,
that
you
shall
be
pleased
to
enjoin
,
which
I
can
do
,
with
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
my
good
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
and
kiss
me
:
<EOS>
this
be
quite
prudent
,
and
shew
me
,
that
you
do
not
take
insolent
advantage
of
my
favour
for
you
;
and
will
,
perhaps
,
stand
you
in
more
stead
than
you
be
aware
of
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
ring
the
bell
,
and
say
,
call
down
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
down
,
and
he
take
my
hand
,
and
put
it
into
hers
;
and
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
be
oblige
to
you
for
all
your
diligence
and
fidelity
to
me
;
but
Pamela
,
I
must
own
,
be
not
;
because
the
service
I
employ
you
in
be
not
so
very
obliging
to
her
,
as
I
could
have
wish
she
would
have
think
it
:
and
you
be
not
to
favour
her
,
but
obey
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
I
will
assure
you
,
at
the
very
first
word
,
she
have
once
oblige
me
,
by
consent
to
be
friend
with
you
;
and
if
she
give
me
no
great
cause
,
I
shall
not
,
perhaps
,
put
you
on
such
disagreeable
service
again
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
be
you
once
more
bed
-
fellow
and
board
-
fellow
,
as
I
may
say
,
for
some
day
longer
;
and
see
that
Pamela
send
no
letter
nor
message
out
of
the
house
,
nor
keep
a
correspondence
unknown
to
me
,
especially
with
that
Williams
;
and
,
as
for
the
rest
,
shew
the
dear
girl
all
the
respect
that
be
due
to
one
I
must
love
,
if
she
will
deserve
it
,
as
I
hope
she
will
yet
;
and
let
her
be
under
no
unnecessary
or
harsh
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
but
your
watchful
care
be
not
,
however
,
to
cease
:
and
remember
that
you
be
not
to
disoblige
me
,
to
oblige
her
;
and
that
I
will
not
,
can
not
,
yet
part
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
look
very
sullen
,
and
as
if
she
would
be
glad
still
to
do
me
a
good
turn
,
if
it
lie
in
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
courage
then
to
drop
a
word
or
two
for
poor
Mr.
Williams
;
but
he
be
angry
with
me
for
it
,
and
say
he
could
not
endure
to
hear
his
name
in
my
mouth
;
so
I
be
force
to
have
do
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
my
paper
,
that
I
bury
under
the
rose
-
bush
,
lie
there
still
;
and
I
beg
for
leave
to
send
a
letter
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
should
,
he
say
,
if
he
may
read
it
first
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
do
not
answer
my
design
;
and
yet
I
would
have
send
you
such
a
letter
as
he
may
see
,
if
I
have
be
sure
my
danger
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
I
can
not
;
for
he
now
seem
to
take
another
method
,
and
what
I
be
more
afraid
of
,
because
,
may
be
,
he
may
watch
an
opportunity
,
and
join
force
with
it
,
on
occasion
,
when
I
be
least
prepared
:
for
now
he
seem
to
abound
with
kindness
,
and
talk
of
love
without
reserve
,
and
make
nothing
of
allow
himself
in
the
liberty
of
kiss
me
,
which
he
call
innocent
;
but
which
I
do
not
like
,
and
especially
in
the
manner
he
do
it
:
but
for
a
master
to
do
it
at
all
to
a
servant
,
have
mean
too
much
in
it
,
not
to
alarm
an
honest
body
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
I
be
watch
and
suspect
still
very
close
;
and
I
wish
I
be
with
you
;
but
that
must
not
be
,
it
seem
,
this
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
this
fortnight
;
and
it
will
be
a
tedious
and
a
dangerous
one
to
me
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
just
now
send
for
me
down
to
take
a
walk
with
him
in
the
garden
:
<EOS>
but
I
like
him
not
at
all
,
nor
his
way
;
for
he
would
have
,
<EOS>
all
the
way
,
his
arm
about
my
waist
,
and
say
abundance
of
fond
thing
to
me
,
enough
to
make
me
proud
,
if
his
design
have
not
be
apparent
.
 
<EOS>
after
walk
about
,
he
lead
me
into
a
little
alcove
,
on
the
farther
part
of
the
garden
;
and
really
make
me
afraid
of
myself
,
for
he
begin
to
be
very
teasing
,
and
make
me
sit
on
his
knee
;
and
be
so
often
kiss
me
,
that
I
say
,
Sir
,
I
do
not
like
to
be
here
at
all
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
you
make
me
afraid
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
make
me
the
more
so
<EOS>
,
be
what
he
once
say
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
do
not
think
I
hear
him
,
and
which
,
though
always
uppermost
with
me
,
I
do
not
mention
before
,
because
I
do
not
know
how
to
bring
it
in
,
in
my
writing
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
I
suppose
,
have
be
encourage
him
in
his
wickedness
;
for
it
be
before
the
last
dreadful
trial
:
and
I
only
hear
what
he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
say
he
,
I
will
try
once
more
;
but
I
have
begin
wrong
for
I
see
terror
do
but
add
to
her
frost
;
but
she
be
a
charming
girl
,
and
may
be
thaw
by
kindness
;
and
I
should
have
melt
her
by
love
,
instead
of
freeze
her
by
fear
.
  
<EOS>
be
he
not
a
wicked
,
sad
man
for
this
?
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
blush
while
I
write
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
trust
,
that
that
God
,
who
have
deliver
me
from
the
paw
of
the
lion
and
the
bear
;
that
is
,
his
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
violence
,
will
soon
deliver
me
from
this
Philistine
,
that
I
may
not
defy
the
command
of
the
live
God
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
this
expression
come
into
my
thought
,
I
be
of
opinion
,
I
could
not
be
too
much
on
my
guard
,
at
all
time
:
more
especially
when
he
take
such
liberty
:
for
he
profess
honour
all
the
time
with
his
mouth
,
while
his
action
do
not
correspond
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
and
pray
he
would
let
me
go
:
and
have
I
not
appear
quite
regardless
of
all
he
say
,
and
resolve
not
to
stay
,
if
I
could
help
it
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
how
far
he
would
have
proceed
;
for
I
be
force
to
fall
down
upon
my
knee
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
walk
out
with
me
,
still
brag
of
his
honour
and
his
love
.
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
sir
,
say
I
,
your
honour
be
to
destroy
mine
:
and
your
love
be
to
ruin
me
;
I
see
it
too
plainly
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
I
will
not
talk
with
you
,
sir
,
say
I
,
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
say
he
,
whom
you
talk
to
,
and
where
you
be
?
  
<EOS>
You
may
believe
I
have
reason
to
think
him
not
so
decent
as
he
should
be
;
for
I
say
,
as
to
where
I
be
,
sir
,
I
know
it
too
well
;
and
that
I
have
no
creature
to
befriend
me
:
and
,
as
to
whom
I
talk
to
,
sir
,
let
me
ask
you
,
what
you
would
have
me
answer
?
  
<EOS>
why
,
tell
me
,
say
he
,
what
answer
you
would
make
?
 
<EOS>
It
will
only
make
you
angry
,
say
I
;
and
so
I
shall
fare
worse
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
angry
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
can
not
be
my
late
good
lady
's
son
;
for
she
love
me
,
and
teach
me
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
then
be
my
master
;
for
no
master
demean
himself
so
to
his
poor
servant
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
round
me
,
and
his
other
hand
on
my
neck
,
which
make
me
more
angry
and
bold
:
and
he
say
,
what
then
be
I
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
(
struggle
from
him
,
and
in
a
great
passion
,
)
to
be
sure
you
be
Lucifer
himself
,
in
the
shape
of
my
master
,
or
you
could
not
use
me
thus
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
too
great
liberty
,
say
he
,
in
anger
;
and
I
desire
that
you
will
not
repeat
them
,
for
your
own
sake
:
<EOS>
for
if
you
have
no
decency
towards
me
,
I
will
have
none
towards
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
run
from
him
,
and
he
say
,
come
back
,
when
I
bid
you
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
know
every
place
be
alike
dangerous
to
me
,
and
I
have
nobody
to
run
to
<EOS>
,
I
come
back
,
at
his
call
;
and
see
him
look
displeased
,
I
hold
my
hand
together
,
and
weep
,
and
say
,
Pray
,
sir
,
forgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
he
,
rather
say
,
Pray
,
Lucifer
,
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
now
,
since
you
take
me
for
the
devil
,
how
can
you
expect
any
good
from
me
?
 
<EOS>
how
,
rather
,
can
you
expect
any
thing
but
the
bad
treatment
from
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
give
me
a
character
,
Pamela
;
and
blame
me
not
that
I
act
up
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
let
me
beg
you
to
forgive
me
:
I
be
really
sorry
for
my
boldness
;
but
indeed
you
do
not
use
me
like
a
gentleman
:
and
how
can
I
express
my
resentment
,
if
I
mince
the
matter
,
while
you
be
so
indecent
?
 
<EOS>
precise
fool
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
what
indecency
have
I
offer
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
bewitch
<EOS>
I
have
not
go
through
my
purpose
last
Sunday
night
;
and
then
your
licentious
tongue
have
not
give
the
bad
name
to
little
puny
freedom
,
<EOS>
that
shew
my
love
and
my
folly
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
begone
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
take
my
hand
,
and
toss
it
from
him
,
and
learn
another
conduct
and
more
wit
;
and
I
will
lay
aside
my
foolish
regard
for
you
,
and
assert
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Begone
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
again
,
with
a
haughty
air
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
can
not
go
,
till
you
pardon
me
,
which
I
beg
on
my
bended
knee
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
truly
sorry
for
my
boldness
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
see
how
you
go
on
:
you
creep
by
little
and
little
upon
me
;
and
now
soothe
me
,
and
now
threaten
me
;
and
if
I
should
forbear
to
shew
my
resentment
,
when
you
offer
incivility
to
me
,
would
not
that
be
to
be
lose
by
degree
?
 
<EOS>
Would
it
not
shew
,
that
I
could
bear
any
thing
from
you
,
if
I
do
not
express
all
the
indignation
I
could
express
,
at
the
first
approach
you
make
to
what
I
dread
?
 
<EOS>
and
have
you
not
as
good
as
avow
my
ruin
?
 
<EOS>
and
have
you
once
make
me
hope
you
will
quit
your
purpose
against
me
?
 
<EOS>
how
then
,
sir
,
can
I
act
,
but
by
shew
my
abhorrence
of
every
step
that
make
towards
my
undoing
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
leave
me
but
<EOS>
word
?
 
<EOS>
and
can
these
word
be
other
than
such
strong
one
,
<EOS>
as
shall
shew
the
detestation
which
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
,
I
have
for
every
attempt
upon
my
virtue
?
 
<EOS>
Judge
for
me
,
sir
,
and
pardon
me
.
  
<EOS>
pardon
you
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
when
you
do
not
repent
?
 
<EOS>
when
you
have
the
boldness
to
justify
yourself
in
your
fault
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
say
,
you
never
will
again
offend
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
,
sir
,
say
I
,
always
to
preserve
that
decency
towards
you
which
become
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
really
,
sir
,
I
must
beg
your
excuse
for
say
,
that
when
you
forget
what
belong
to
decency
in
your
action
,
and
when
word
be
all
that
be
leave
me
,
to
shew
my
resentment
of
such
action
,
I
will
not
promise
to
forbear
the
strong
expression
that
my
distressed
mind
shall
suggest
to
me
:
nor
shall
your
angriest
frown
deter
me
,
when
my
honesty
be
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
what
,
then
,
say
he
,
do
you
beg
pardon
for
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
the
promise
of
amendment
,
for
which
I
should
forgive
you
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
own
that
must
absolutely
depend
on
your
usage
of
me
:
<EOS>
for
I
will
bear
any
thing
you
can
inflict
upon
me
with
patience
,
even
to
the
lay
down
of
my
life
,
to
shew
my
obedience
to
you
in
other
case
;
but
I
can
not
be
patient
,
I
can
not
be
passive
,
when
my
virtue
be
at
stake
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
criminal
in
me
,
if
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
never
see
such
a
fool
in
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
walk
by
the
side
of
me
some
yard
,
without
say
a
word
,
and
seem
vexed
;
and
at
last
walk
in
,
bid
me
attend
him
in
the
garden
,
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
so
have
a
little
time
,
I
go
up
,
and
write
thus
far
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
night
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
my
dear
parent
,
I
be
not
destine
more
surely
than
ever
for
ruin
,
I
have
now
more
comfort
before
me
than
ever
I
yet
know
:
and
be
either
nearer
<EOS>
my
happiness
,
or
my
misery
,
than
ever
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
God
protect
me
from
the
latter
,
if
it
be
his
blessed
will
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
such
a
scene
to
open
to
you
,
that
,
I
know
,
will
alarm
both
your
hope
and
your
fear
,
as
it
do
mine
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
it
be
:
  
<EOS>
after
my
master
have
dine
,
he
take
a
turn
into
the
stable
,
to
look
at
his
stud
of
horse
;
and
,
when
he
come
in
,
he
open
the
parlour
-
door
,
where
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
I
sit
at
dinner
;
and
,
at
his
entrance
,
we
both
rise
up
;
but
he
say
,
Sit
still
,
sit
still
,
and
let
me
see
how
you
eat
your
victual
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
say
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
very
poorly
,
indeed
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
I
,
pretty
well
,
sir
,
consider
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
your
considering
,
say
he
,
pretty
face
;
and
tap
me
on
the
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
I
blush
,
but
be
glad
he
be
so
good
-
humoured
;
but
I
could
not
tell
how
to
sit
before
him
,
nor
to
behave
myself
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
say
,
I
know
,
Pamela
,
you
be
a
nice
carver
:
my
mother
use
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
My
lady
,
sir
,
say
I
,
be
very
good
to
me
in
every
thing
,
and
would
always
make
me
do
the
honour
of
her
table
for
her
,
when
she
be
with
her
few
select
friend
that
she
love
.
 
<EOS>
cut
up
,
say
he
,
that
chicken
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
say
he
,
and
take
a
knife
and
fork
,
and
put
a
wing
upon
my
plate
,
let
me
see
you
eat
that
.
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
eat
a
whole
breast
of
a
chicken
already
,
and
can
not
eat
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
say
,
I
must
eat
it
for
his
sake
,
and
he
would
teach
me
to
eat
heartily
:
<EOS>
so
I
do
eat
it
;
but
be
much
confused
at
his
so
kind
and
unusual
freedom
and
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
good
lack
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
imagine
how
Mrs.
Jewkes
look
and
stare
,
and
how
respectful
she
seem
to
me
,
and
call
me
good
madam
,
I
will
assure
you
,
urge
me
to
take
a
little
bit
of
tart
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
take
two
or
three
turn
about
the
room
,
musing
and
thoughtful
,
as
I
have
never
before
see
him
;
and
at
last
he
go
out
,
say
,
I
be
go
into
the
garden
:
You
know
,
<EOS>
Pamela
,
what
I
say
to
you
before
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
rise
,
and
courtesie
,
say
,
I
would
attend
his
honour
;
and
he
say
,
do
,
good
girl
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
see
how
thing
will
go
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
madam
,
as
she
call
me
again
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
you
be
to
be
our
mistress
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
know
what
will
become
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
ah
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
if
I
can
but
keep
myself
virtuous
,
'
tis
the
most
of
my
ambition
;
and
I
hope
,
no
temptation
shall
make
me
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
I
have
no
reason
to
be
pleased
with
his
treatment
of
me
before
dinner
,
yet
I
make
haste
to
attend
him
;
and
I
find
him
walk
by
the
side
of
that
pond
,
which
,
for
want
of
grace
,
and
through
a
sinful
despondence
,
have
like
to
have
be
so
fatal
to
me
,
and
the
sight
of
which
,
ever
since
,
have
be
a
trouble
and
reproach
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
by
the
side
of
this
pond
,
and
not
far
from
the
place
where
I
have
that
dread
conflict
,
that
my
present
hope
,
if
I
be
not
to
be
deceive
again
,
begin
to
dawn
:
<EOS>
which
I
presume
to
flatter
myself
with
be
a
happy
oman
for
me
,
as
if
God
Almighty
would
shew
your
poor
sinful
daughter
,
how
well
I
do
to
put
my
affiance
in
his
goodness
,
and
not
to
throw
away
myself
,
because
my
ruin
seem
inevitable
,
to
my
short
-
sight
apprehension
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
be
pleased
to
say
<EOS>
,
well
,
Pamela
,
I
be
glad
you
be
come
of
your
own
accord
,
as
I
may
say
:
give
me
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
;
and
he
look
at
me
very
steadily
,
and
press
my
hand
all
the
time
<EOS>
,
at
last
say
,
I
will
now
talk
to
you
in
a
serious
manner
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
a
good
deal
of
wit
,
a
great
deal
of
penetration
,
much
beyond
your
year
,
and
,
as
I
think
,
your
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
possess
of
an
open
,
frank
,
and
generous
mind
;
and
a
person
so
lovely
,
that
you
excel
all
your
sex
,
in
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
accomplishment
have
engage
my
affection
so
deeply
,
that
,
as
I
have
often
say
,
I
can
not
live
without
you
;
and
I
would
divide
,
with
all
my
soul
,
my
estate
with
you
,
to
make
you
mine
upon
my
own
term
.
 
<EOS>
these
you
have
absolutely
reject
;
and
that
,
though
in
saucy
term
enough
,
yet
in
such
a
manner
as
make
me
admire
you
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
Your
pretty
chit
-
chat
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
the
last
Sunday
night
,
<EOS>
so
innocent
,
and
so
full
of
beautiful
simplicity
,
half
disarm
my
resolution
before
I
approach
your
bed
:
<EOS>
and
I
see
you
so
watchful
over
your
virtue
,
that
though
I
hope
to
find
it
otherwise
,
I
can
not
but
confess
my
passion
for
you
be
increase
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
what
shall
I
say
farther
,
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
you
,
though
a
party
,
my
adviser
in
this
matter
,
though
not
,
perhaps
,
my
definitive
judge
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
I
be
not
a
very
abandon
profligate
;
I
have
hitherto
be
guilty
of
no
very
enormous
or
vile
action
.
 
<EOS>
this
of
seize
you
,
and
confine
you
thus
,
may
perhaps
be
one
of
the
bad
,
at
least
to
person
of
real
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
be
utterly
give
up
to
my
passion
,
I
should
before
now
have
gratify
them
,
and
not
have
shew
that
remorse
and
compassion
for
you
,
which
have
reprieve
you
,
more
than
once
,
when
absolutely
in
my
power
;
and
you
be
as
inviolate
a
virgin
as
you
be
when
you
come
into
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
consider
the
pride
of
my
condition
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
the
thought
of
marriage
,
even
with
a
person
of
equal
or
superior
degree
to
myself
;
and
have
decline
several
proposal
of
that
kind
:
how
then
,
with
the
distance
between
us
in
the
world
's
judgment
,
can
I
think
of
make
you
my
wife
?
 
<EOS>
yet
I
must
have
you
;
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
any
other
man
supplant
me
in
your
affection
:
and
the
very
apprehension
of
that
have
make
me
hate
the
name
of
Williams
,
and
use
him
in
a
manner
unworthy
of
my
temper
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Pamela
,
judge
for
me
;
and
,
since
I
have
tell
you
,
thus
candidly
,
my
mind
,
and
I
see
yours
be
big
with
some
important
meaning
,
by
your
eye
,
your
blush
,
and
that
sweet
confusion
which
I
behold
struggle
in
your
bosom
,
tell
me
,
with
like
openness
and
candour
,
what
you
think
I
ought
to
do
,
and
what
you
would
have
me
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
express
the
agitation
of
my
mind
,
on
this
unexpected
declaration
,
so
contrary
to
his
former
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
too
have
something
so
noble
,
and
so
sincere
,
as
I
think
,
<EOS>
that
,
alas
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
have
need
of
all
my
poor
discretion
,
to
ward
off
the
blow
which
this
treatment
give
to
my
most
guard
thought
.
 
<EOS>
I
throw
myself
at
his
foot
;
for
I
tremble
,
and
could
hardly
stand
:
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
spare
your
poor
servant
's
confusion
!
 
<EOS>
o
spare
the
poor
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
speak
out
,
say
he
,
and
tell
me
,
when
I
bid
you
,
what
you
think
I
ought
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
what
you
ought
to
do
,
answer
I
:
<EOS>
but
I
only
beg
you
will
not
ruin
me
;
and
,
if
you
think
me
virtuous
,
if
you
think
me
sincerely
honest
,
let
me
go
to
my
poor
parent
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
vow
to
you
,
that
I
will
never
suffer
myself
to
be
engage
without
your
approbation
.
  
<EOS>
still
he
insist
upon
a
more
explicit
answer
to
his
question
,
of
what
I
think
he
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
,
<EOS>
as
to
my
poor
thought
of
what
you
ought
to
do
,
I
must
needs
say
,
that
indeed
I
think
you
ought
to
regard
the
world
's
opinion
,
and
avoid
do
any
thing
disgraceful
to
your
birth
and
fortune
;
and
,
therefore
,
if
you
really
honour
the
poor
Pamela
with
your
respect
,
a
little
time
,
absence
,
and
the
conversation
of
worthy
person
of
my
sex
,
will
effectually
enable
you
to
overcome
a
regard
so
unworthy
your
condition
:
<EOS>
and
this
,
good
sir
,
be
the
good
advice
I
can
offer
.
  
<EOS>
charming
creature
!
<EOS>
lovely
Pamela
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
(
with
an
ardour
that
be
never
before
so
agreeable
to
me
,
)
<EOS>
this
generous
manner
be
of
a
piece
with
all
the
rest
of
your
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
still
more
explicitly
,
what
you
would
advise
me
to
,
in
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
sir
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
take
not
advantage
of
my
credulity
,
and
these
my
weak
moment
:
but
be
I
the
first
lady
in
the
land
,
instead
of
the
poor
abject
Pamela
<EOS>
,
I
would
,
I
could
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
say
no
more
   
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
<EOS>
now
I
know
you
will
indeed
be
concern
for
me
;
 
for
now
I
be
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
begin
to
be
afraid
<EOS>
I
know
too
well
<EOS>
the
reason
why
all
his
hard
trial
of
me
,
and
my
black
apprehension
,
would
not
let
me
hate
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
assure
still
,
by
God
's
grace
<EOS>
,
that
I
shall
do
nothing
unworthy
of
your
Pamela
;
and
if
I
find
that
he
be
still
capable
of
deceive
me
,
and
that
this
conduct
be
only
put
on
to
delude
me
more
,
I
shall
think
nothing
in
this
world
so
vile
,
and
so
odious
;
and
nothing
,
if
he
be
not
the
bad
of
his
kind
,
(
as
he
say
,
and
,
<EOS>
I
hope
,
he
be
not
,
)
so
desperately
guileful
,
as
the
heart
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
generously
say
,
I
will
spare
your
confusion
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
I
may
promise
myself
,
that
you
can
love
me
preferably
to
any
other
man
;
and
that
no
one
in
the
world
have
have
any
share
in
your
affection
;
for
I
be
very
jealous
of
what
I
love
;
and
if
I
think
you
have
a
secret
whispering
in
your
soul
,
that
have
not
yet
come
up
to
a
wish
,
for
any
other
man
breathe
,
I
should
not
forgive
myself
to
persist
in
my
affection
for
you
;
nor
you
,
if
you
do
not
frankly
acquaint
me
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
still
continue
on
my
knee
,
on
the
grass
border
by
the
pond
-
side
,
he
sit
himself
down
on
the
grass
by
me
,
and
take
me
in
his
arm
:
<EOS>
why
hesitate
my
Pamela
?
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
not
answer
me
with
truth
,
as
I
wish
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
can
not
,
speak
,
and
I
will
forgive
you
.
  
<EOS>
o
good
sir
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
it
be
not
that
;
indeed
it
be
not
:
but
a
frightful
word
or
two
that
you
say
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
when
you
think
I
be
not
in
hearing
,
come
cross
my
mind
;
and
make
me
dread
that
I
be
in
more
danger
than
ever
I
be
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
never
find
me
a
common
liar
,
say
he
,
(
too
fearful
and
foolish
Pamela
!
)
<EOS>
nor
will
I
answer
how
long
I
may
hold
in
my
present
mind
;
for
my
pride
struggle
hard
within
me
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
;
and
if
you
doubt
me
,
I
have
no
obligation
to
your
confidence
or
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
at
present
,
I
be
really
sincere
in
what
I
say
:
<EOS>
and
I
expect
you
will
be
so
too
;
and
answer
directly
my
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
know
not
myself
;
and
your
question
be
of
such
a
nature
,
that
I
only
want
to
tell
you
what
I
hear
,
and
to
have
your
kind
answer
to
it
;
or
else
,
what
I
have
to
say
to
your
question
,
may
pave
the
way
to
my
ruin
,
and
shew
a
weakness
that
I
do
not
believe
be
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
you
may
say
what
you
have
overhear
;
for
,
in
not
answer
me
directly
,
you
put
my
soul
upon
the
rack
;
and
half
the
trouble
I
have
have
with
you
would
have
bring
to
my
arm
one
of
the
fine
lady
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
my
virtue
be
as
dear
to
me
,
as
if
I
be
of
the
high
quality
;
and
my
doubt
(
for
which
you
know
I
have
have
too
much
reason
)
have
make
me
troublesome
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
sir
,
I
will
tell
you
what
I
hear
,
which
have
give
me
great
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
You
talk
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
of
have
begin
wrong
with
me
,
in
try
to
subdue
me
with
terror
,
and
of
frost
,
and
such
like
 
<EOS>
You
remember
it
well
:
 
and
that
you
would
,
for
the
future
,
change
your
conduct
,
and
try
to
melt
me
,
that
be
your
word
,
by
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
I
fear
not
,
sir
,
the
grace
of
God
support
me
,
that
any
act
of
kindness
would
make
me
forget
what
I
owe
to
my
virtue
:
but
,
sir
,
I
may
,
I
find
,
be
make
more
miserable
by
such
act
,
than
by
terror
;
because
my
nature
be
too
frank
and
open
to
make
me
wish
to
be
ungrateful
:
and
if
I
should
be
teach
a
lesson
I
never
yet
learn
,
with
what
regret
should
I
descend
to
the
grave
,
to
think
that
I
could
not
hate
my
undoer
:
and
that
,
at
the
last
great
day
,
I
must
stand
up
as
an
accuser
of
the
poor
unhappy
soul
,
that
I
could
wish
it
in
my
power
to
save
!
  
<EOS>
exalted
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
what
a
thought
be
that
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
now
,
Pamela
,
you
excel
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
give
me
a
hint
that
will
hold
me
long
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sweet
creature
,
say
he
,
tell
me
what
be
this
lesson
,
which
you
never
yet
learn
,
and
which
you
be
so
afraid
of
learn
?
  
<EOS>
if
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
will
again
generously
spare
my
confusion
<EOS>
,
I
need
not
speak
it
:
<EOS>
but
this
I
will
say
,
in
answer
to
the
question
you
seem
most
solicitous
about
,
that
I
know
not
the
man
breathe
that
I
would
wish
to
be
marry
to
,
or
that
ever
I
think
of
with
such
an
idea
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bring
my
mind
so
to
love
poverty
<EOS>
,
that
I
hope
for
nothing
but
to
return
to
the
good
,
though
the
poor
of
parent
;
and
to
employ
myself
in
serve
God
,
and
comfort
them
;
and
you
know
not
,
sir
,
how
you
disappoint
those
hope
,
and
my
propose
honest
pleasure
,
when
you
send
me
hither
.
  
<EOS>
well
then
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
I
may
promise
myself
,
that
neither
the
parson
,
nor
any
other
man
,
be
any
the
least
secret
motive
to
your
steadfast
refusal
of
my
offer
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
may
;
and
,
as
you
be
pleased
to
ask
,
I
answer
,
that
I
have
not
the
least
shadow
of
a
wish
,
or
think
,
for
any
man
live
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
(
for
I
be
foolishly
jealous
,
and
yet
it
shew
my
fondness
for
you
,
)
<EOS>
have
you
not
encourage
Williams
to
think
you
will
have
him
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
not
;
but
the
very
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
and
would
you
not
have
have
him
,
say
he
,
if
you
have
get
away
by
his
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
resolve
,
sir
,
say
I
,
in
my
mind
,
otherwise
;
and
he
know
it
;
and
the
poor
man
 
I
charge
you
,
say
he
,
say
not
a
word
in
his
favour
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
excite
a
whirlwind
in
my
soul
,
if
you
name
him
with
kindness
;
and
then
you
will
be
bear
away
with
the
temp
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
do
!
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
say
he
,
but
do
not
have
do
;
let
me
know
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
regard
for
him
,
speak
out
;
for
it
would
end
fearfully
for
you
,
for
me
,
and
for
him
,
if
I
find
that
you
disguise
any
secret
of
your
soul
from
me
,
in
this
nice
particular
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
if
I
have
ever
give
you
cause
to
think
me
sincere
 
<EOS>
say
then
,
say
he
,
interrupt
me
with
great
vehemence
,
and
take
both
my
hand
between
his
,
say
,
that
you
now
,
in
the
presence
of
God
,
declare
that
you
have
not
any
the
most
hidden
regard
for
Williams
,
or
any
other
man
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
as
God
shall
bless
me
,
and
preserve
my
innocence
,
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
I
will
believe
you
,
Pamela
;
and
in
time
,
perhaps
,
I
may
better
bear
that
man
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
be
convinced
that
you
be
not
prepossess
,
my
vanity
make
me
assure
,
that
I
need
not
to
fear
a
place
in
your
esteem
,
equal
,
if
not
preferable
,
to
any
man
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
it
sting
my
pride
to
the
quick
,
that
you
be
so
easily
bring
,
and
at
such
a
short
acquaintance
,
to
run
away
with
that
college
novice
!
  
<EOS>
o
good
sir
,
say
I
,
may
I
be
hear
one
thing
?
 
<EOS>
and
though
I
bring
upon
me
your
high
indignation
,
I
will
tell
you
,
perhaps
,
the
unnecessary
and
imprudent
,
but
yet
the
whole
truth
.
  
<EOS>
My
honesty
(
I
be
poor
and
lowly
,
and
be
not
entitle
to
call
it
honour
)
be
in
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
no
means
of
secure
myself
from
your
avow
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
shew
you
would
not
stick
at
little
matter
;
and
what
,
sir
,
could
any
body
have
think
of
my
sincerity
,
in
prefer
that
to
all
other
consideration
,
if
I
have
not
escape
from
these
danger
,
if
I
could
have
find
any
way
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
say
any
thing
for
him
;
but
,
indeed
,
indeed
,
sir
,
I
be
the
cause
of
put
him
upon
assist
me
in
my
escape
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
him
to
acquaint
me
<EOS>
what
gentry
there
be
in
the
neighbourhood
that
I
may
fly
to
;
and
prevail
upon
him
 
do
not
frown
at
me
,
good
sir
;
for
I
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth
 
to
apply
to
one
Lady
Jones
;
to
Lady
Darnford
;
and
he
be
so
good
to
apply
to
Mr.
Peters
,
the
minister
:
<EOS>
but
they
all
refuse
me
;
and
then
it
be
he
let
me
know
,
that
there
be
no
honourable
way
but
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
decline
;
and
he
agree
to
assist
me
for
God
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
say
he
,
you
be
go
 
<EOS>
I
boldly
put
my
hand
before
his
mouth
,
hardly
know
the
liberty
I
take
:
pray
,
sir
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
do
not
be
angry
;
I
have
just
do
 
<EOS>
I
would
only
say
,
that
rather
than
have
staid
to
be
ruin
,
I
would
have
throw
myself
upon
the
poor
beggar
that
ever
the
world
see
,
if
I
think
him
honest
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
when
you
duly
weigh
all
matter
,
you
will
forgive
me
,
and
not
think
me
so
bold
,
and
so
forward
,
as
you
have
be
pleased
to
call
me
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
even
in
this
your
last
speech
,
which
,
let
me
tell
you
,
shew
more
your
honesty
of
heart
than
your
prudence
,
you
have
not
over
-
much
please
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
love
you
;
and
that
vex
me
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
Pamela
,
for
now
the
former
question
recur
:
<EOS>
since
you
so
much
prize
your
honour
,
and
your
virtue
;
since
all
attempt
against
that
be
so
odious
to
you
;
and
since
I
have
avowedly
make
several
of
these
attempt
,
do
you
think
it
be
possible
for
you
to
love
me
preferably
to
any
other
of
my
sex
?
  
<EOS>
ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
and
here
my
doubt
recur
,
that
you
may
thus
graciously
use
me
,
to
take
advantage
of
my
credulity
.
  
<EOS>
still
perverse
and
doubting
!
<EOS>
say
he
 
<EOS>
can
not
you
take
me
as
I
be
at
present
?
 
<EOS>
and
that
,
I
have
tell
you
,
be
sincere
and
undesigning
,
whatever
I
may
be
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
reply
I
<EOS>
,
what
can
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
say
too
much
,
if
this
dreadful
hereafter
should
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
bid
me
say
how
well
I
can
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
my
face
glow
as
the
fire
,
I
,
all
abash
,
lean
upon
his
shoulder
,
to
hide
my
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
He
clasp
me
to
him
with
great
ardour
,
and
say
,
hide
your
dear
face
in
my
bosom
,
my
beloved
Pamela
!
<EOS>
your
innocent
freedom
charm
me
!
 
<EOS>
but
then
say
,
<EOS>
how
well
 
what
?
  
<EOS>
if
you
will
be
good
,
say
I
,
to
your
poor
servant
,
and
spare
her
,
I
can
not
say
too
much
!
 
<EOS>
but
if
not
,
I
be
doubly
undone
!
 
<EOS>
Undone
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
say
he
,
<EOS>
I
hope
my
present
temper
will
hold
;
for
I
tell
you
frankly
,
that
I
have
know
,
in
this
agreeable
hour
,
more
sincere
pleasure
than
I
have
experience
in
all
the
guilty
tumult
that
my
desire
soul
compel
me
into
,
in
the
hope
of
possess
you
on
my
own
term
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
Pamela
,
you
must
pray
for
the
continuance
of
this
temper
;
and
I
hope
your
prayer
will
get
the
well
of
my
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
this
sweet
goodness
overpower
all
my
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
I
throw
myself
at
his
foot
,
and
embrace
his
knee
:
<EOS>
what
pleasure
,
sir
,
you
give
me
at
these
gracious
word
,
be
not
lend
your
poor
servant
to
express
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
too
much
reward
for
all
my
suffering
,
if
this
goodness
hold
!
 
<EOS>
God
grant
it
<EOS>
may
,
for
your
own
soul
's
sake
as
well
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
happy
should
I
be
,
if
     
He
stopt
me
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
girl
,
what
must
we
do
about
the
world
,
and
the
world
's
censure
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
can
not
marry
!
  
<EOS>
now
be
I
again
strike
all
of
a
heap
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
soon
recollect
myself
,
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
not
the
presumption
to
hope
such
an
honour
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
may
be
permit
to
return
in
peace
and
safety
to
my
poor
parent
,
to
pray
for
you
there
,
it
be
all
I
at
present
request
!
 
<EOS>
this
,
sir
,
after
all
my
apprehension
and
danger
,
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
know
my
own
poor
heart
,
I
shall
wish
you
happy
in
a
lady
of
suitable
degree
;
and
rejoice
most
sincerely
in
every
circumstance
that
shall
make
for
the
happiness
of
my
late
good
lady
's
most
beloved
son
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
this
conversation
,
Pamela
,
be
go
farther
than
I
intend
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
,
at
this
rate
,
of
trust
yourself
with
me
:
but
it
be
I
that
ought
to
be
doubtful
of
myself
,
when
I
be
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
I
say
any
thing
farther
on
this
subject
,
I
will
take
my
proud
heart
to
task
;
and
,
till
then
,
let
every
thing
be
as
if
this
conversation
have
never
pass
.
 
<EOS>
only
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
the
more
confidence
you
place
in
me
,
the
more
you
will
oblige
me
:
but
your
doubt
will
only
beget
cause
of
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
and
with
this
ambiguous
saying
,
he
salute
me
with
a
more
formal
manner
,
if
I
may
so
say
,
than
before
,
and
lend
me
his
hand
;
and
so
we
walk
toward
the
house
,
side
by
side
<EOS>
,
he
seem
very
thoughtful
and
pensive
,
as
if
he
have
already
repent
him
of
his
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
,
<EOS>
what
step
take
,
if
all
this
be
design
 
o
the
perplexity
of
these
cruel
doubting
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
if
he
be
false
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
I
have
go
too
far
,
much
too
far
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
ready
,
on
the
apprehension
of
this
,
to
bite
my
forward
tongue
(
or
rather
to
beat
my
more
forward
heart
,
that
dictate
to
that
poor
machine
)
for
what
I
have
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
sure
,
at
least
,
he
must
be
sincere
for
the
time
!
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
such
a
practise
dissembler
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
could
,
o
how
desperately
wicked
be
the
heart
of
man
!
 
<EOS>
and
where
could
he
learn
all
these
barbarous
art
?
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
it
must
be
native
surely
to
the
sex
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
silent
be
my
rash
censuring
;
be
hush
,
<EOS>
ye
stormy
tumult
of
my
disturbed
mind
!
<EOS>
for
have
I
not
a
father
who
be
a
man
?
 
<EOS>
a
man
who
know
no
guile
!
<EOS>
who
would
do
no
wrong
!
 
<EOS>
who
would
not
deceive
or
oppress
,
to
gain
a
kingdom
!
 
<EOS>
how
then
can
I
think
it
be
native
to
the
sex
?
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
also
hope
my
good
lady
's
son
can
not
be
the
bad
of
man
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
,
hard
the
lot
of
the
excellent
woman
that
bear
him
!
 
<EOS>
but
much
hard
the
hap
of
your
poor
Pamela
,
who
have
fall
into
such
hand
!
 
<EOS>
but
yet
I
will
trust
in
God
,
and
hope
the
good
:
and
so
lay
down
my
tired
pen
for
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
somebody
rap
at
our
chamber
-
door
this
morning
,
soon
after

<EOS>
My
master
say

the
door

Mrs.
Jewkes

<EOS>
o

say
I
,
for
God
's
sake
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
do
not
!
 
<EOS>
indeed

say
she

but
I
must

<EOS>
then
,
say
I
,
and
cling
about
her
,
let
me
slip
on
my
clothe
first
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
rap
again
,
and
she
break
from
me
;
and
I
be
frighten
out
of
my
wit
,
and
fold
myself
in
the
bed
-
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
He
enter
,
and
say
,
what

<EOS>

after
what

yesterday
between
us

<EOS>
o

say
I
<EOS>
,
I
fear
my
prayer

their
wished
effect
!
 
<EOS>
Pray

good
sir
,
consider
 
He
sit
down
on
the
bed
-
side
,
and
interrupt
me
;
no
need
of
your
foolish
fear
;
I
shall
say
but
a
word
or
two
,
and
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
after
you
go
up
stair
,
say
he
,
I
have
an
invitation
to
a
ball
,
which
be
to
be
this
night
at
Stamford
,
on
occasion
of
a
wedding
;
and
I
be
go
to
call
on
Sir
Simon
,
and
his
lady
and
daughter
;
for
the
bride
be
a
relation
of
theirs
:
<EOS>
so
I
shall
not
be
at
home
till
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
,
therefore
,
to
caution
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
before
Pamela
,
(
that
she
may
not
wonder
at
be
closer
confine
,
than
for
these
three
or
four
day
past
,
)
<EOS>
that
nobody
see
her
,
nor
deliver
any
letter
to
her
,
in
that
space
;
for
a
person
have
be
see
lurk
about
,
and
inquire
after
her
,
and
I
have
be
well
informed
,
that
either
Mrs.
Jervis
,
or
Mr.
Longman
,
have
write
a
letter
,
with
a
design
of
have
it
convey
to
her
:
<EOS>
and
,
say
he
,
you
must
know
,
Pamela
,
that
I
have
order
Mr.
Longman
to
give
up
his
account
,
and
have
dismiss
Jonathan
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
since
I
have
be
here
;
for
their
behaviour
have
be
intolerable
;
and
they
have
make
such
a
breach
between
my
sister
Davers
and
me
,
as
we
shall
never
,
perhaps
,
make
up
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Pamela
,
I
shall
take
it
kindly
in
you
,
if
you
will
confine
yourself
to
your
chamber
pretty
much
,
for
the
time
I
be
absent
,
and
not
give
Mrs.
Jewkes
cause
of
trouble
or
uneasiness
;
and
the
rather
,
as
you
know
she
act
by
my
order
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
I
,
I
fear
all
these
good
people
have
suffer
for
my
sake
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
I
believe
so
too
;
and
there
be
never
a
girl
of
your
innocence
,
that
set
a
large
family
in
such
an
uproar
,
surely
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
both
of
you
<EOS>
my
mind
,
and
,
in
part
,
the
reason
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
say
,
that
I
have
have
such
a
letter
from
my
sister
,
as
I
could
not
have
expect
;
and
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
neither
you
nor
I
have
reason
to
thank
her
,
as
you
shall
know
,
perhaps
at
my
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
my
coach
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
because
I
take
Lady
Darnford
,
and
Mrs.
Peters
's
niece
,
and
one
of
Lady
Darnford
's
daughter
,
along
with
me
;
and
Sir
Simon
and
his
other
daughter
go
in
his
chariot
:
<EOS>
so
let
all
the
gate
be
fasten
;
and
do
not
take
any
airing
in
either
of
the
chariot
,
nor
let
any
body
go
to
the
gate
,
without
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
sure
,
say
she
,
to
obey
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
give
Mrs.
jewke
no
trouble
,
sir
,
say
I
;
and
will
keep
pretty
much
in
my
chamber
,
and
not
stir
so
much
as
into
the
garden
without
her
;
to
shew
you
I
will
obey
in
every
thing
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
begin
to
fear
 
ay
,
say
he
,
more
plot
and
contrivance
,
do
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
assure
you
,
you
never
have
less
reason
;
and
I
tell
you
the
truth
;
for
I
be
really
go
to
Stamford
this
time
;
and
upon
the
occasion
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
Pamela
,
give
me
your
hand
,
and
one
kiss
;
and
then
I
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
durst
not
refuse
,
and
say
,
God
bless
you
,
sir
,
wherever
you
go
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
sorry
for
what
you
tell
me
about
your
servant
!
  
<EOS>
He
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
a
little
talk
without
the
door
;
and
I
hear
her
say
,
You
may
depend
,
sir
,
upon
my
care
and
vigilance
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
in
his
coach
,
as
he
say
he
should
,
and
very
richly
dress
,
which
look
as
if
what
he
say
be
likely
:
but
really
I
have
be
use
to
so
many
trick
,
and
plot
,
and
surprise
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
but
I
mourn
for
poor
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
so
here
be
Parson
Williams
;
here
be
poor
naughty
John
;
here
be
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
,
turn
away
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
be
rich
,
indeed
,
and
so
need
the
less
matter
it
;
but
I
know
it
will
grieve
him
:
and
for
poor
Mr.
Jonathan
,
I
be
sure
it
will
cut
that
good
old
servant
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
alas
for
me
!
<EOS>
what
mischief
be
I
the
occasion
of
!
 
<EOS>
or
,
rather
,
my
master
,
whose
action
towards
me
have
make
so
many
of
my
kind
friend
forfeit
his
favour
,
for
my
sake
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
sad
about
these
thing
:
if
he
really
love
me
,
methink
he
should
not
be
so
angry
,
that
his
servant
love
me
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
think
!
  
<EOS>
Friday
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
remove
my
paper
from
under
the
rose
-
bush
;
for
I
see
the
gardener
begin
to
dig
near
that
spot
;
and
I
be
afraid
he
would
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
I
be
look
yesterday
through
the
iron
gate
that
front
the
elm
;
and
a
gipsy
-
like
body
make
up
to
us
,
and
say
;
<EOS>
if
,
madam
,
you
will
give
me
some
break
victual
,
I
will
tell
you
both
your
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
let
us
hear
our
fortune
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
I
do
not
like
these
sort
of
people
;
but
we
will
hear
what
she
will
say
to
us
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
fetch
you
any
victual
,
woman
;
but
I
will
give
you
some
penny
,
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
but
Nan
come
out
,
she
say
,
fetch
some
bread
,
and
some
of
the
cold
meat
,
and
you
shall
have
your
fortune
tell
,
Nan
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
you
will
think
,
like
some
of
my
other
matter
,
a
very
trifling
thing
to
write
about
.
 
<EOS>
but
mark
the
discovery
of
a
dreadful
plot
,
which
I
have
make
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
bless
me
!
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
think
of
this
naughty
<EOS>
,
this
very
naughty
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
now
will
I
hate
him
most
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
be
:
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
no
suspicion
of
the
woman
,
the
iron
gate
be
lock
,
and
she
on
the
outside
,
and
we
on
the
inside
;
and
so
put
her
hand
through
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
mutter
over
a
parcel
of
cramp
word
;
why
,
madam
,
you
will
marry
soon
,
I
can
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
she
seem
pleased
,
and
say
,
I
be
glad
to
hear
that
;
and
shake
her
fat
side
with
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
look
most
earnestly
at
me
,
all
the
time
,
and
as
if
she
have
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
come
into
my
head
,
from
my
master
's
caution
,
that
possibly
this
woman
may
be
employ
to
try
to
get
a
letter
into
my
hand
;
and
I
be
resolve
to
watch
all
her
motion
.
 
<EOS>
so
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
what
sort
of
a
man
shall
I
have
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
a
man
young
than
yourself
;
and
a
very
good
husband
he
will
prove
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
that
,
say
she
;
and
laugh
again
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
madam
,
let
us
hear
your
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
come
to
me
,
and
take
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
I
can
not
tell
your
fortune
:
<EOS>
your
hand
be
so
white
and
fine
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
see
the
line
:
but
,
say
she
,
and
,
stoop
,
pull
up
a
little
tuft
of
grass
,
I
have
a
way
for
that
;
and
so
rub
my
hand
with
the
mould
part
of
the
tuft
:
now
,
say
she
,
I
can
see
the
line
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
very
watchful
of
all
her
way
,
and
take
the
tuft
,
and
look
upon
it
,
lest
any
thing
should
be
in
that
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
woman
say
,
here
be
the
line
of
Jupiter
cross
the
line
of
life
;
and
Mars
 
Odd
!
<EOS>
my
pretty
mistress
,
say
she
,
you
have
best
take
care
of
yourself
;
for
you
be
hard
beset
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
never
be
marry
,
I
can
see
;
and
will
die
of
your
first
child
.
 
<EOS>
out
upon
thee
,
woman
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
better
thou
hadst
never
come
here
.
  
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
whisper
,
I
do
not
like
this
<EOS>
:
it
look
like
a
cheat
:
<EOS>
pray
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
go
in
,
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
,
say
I
;
for
I
have
enough
of
fortune
-
telling
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
I
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
want
sadly
to
tell
me
more
,
which
make
Mrs.
Jewkes
threaten
her
,
suspect
still
the
more
;
and
away
the
woman
go
,
have
tell
Nan
her
fortune
,
and
she
would
be
drown
.
  
<EOS>
this
thing
run
strongly
in
all
our
head
;
and
we
go
,
an
hour
after
,
to
see
if
the
woman
be
lurk
about
,
and
take
Mr.
Colbrand
for
our
guard
.
<EOS>
look
through
the
iron
gate
,
he
spy
a
man
saunter
about
the
middle
of
the
walk
;
which
fill
Mrs.
jewke
with
still
more
suspicion
;
and
she
say
,
Mr.
Colbrand
,
you
and
I
will
walk
towards
this
fellow
,
and
see
what
he
saunter
there
for
:
<EOS>
and
,
Nan
,
do
you
and
madam
stay
at
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
open
the
iron
gate
and
walk
down
towards
the
man
;
and
guess
the
woman
,
if
employ
,
must
mean
something
by
the
tuft
of
grass
,
I
cast
my
eye
that
way
,
whence
she
pull
it
,
and
see
more
grass
seemingly
pull
up
:
then
I
doubt
not
something
be
there
for
me
;
and
I
walk
to
it
,
and
stand
over
it
,
say
to
Nan
,
that
be
a
pretty
sort
of
wild
flower
,
that
grow
yonder
,
near
the
elm
,
the
fifth
from
us
on
the
left
;
pray
pull
it
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
It
be
a
common
weed
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
but
pull
it
for
me
;
there
be
sometimes
beautiful
colour
in
a
weed
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
go
on
,
I
stoop
,
and
pull
up
a
good
handful
of
the
grass
,
and
in
it
a
bit
of
paper
,
which
I
put
instantly
in
my
bosom
,
and
dropt
the
grass
:
and
my
heart
go
pit
-
a
-
pat
at
the
odd
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
,
<EOS>
let
's
go
in
,
Mrs.
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
,
we
must
stay
till
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
all
impatience
to
read
this
paper
:
and
when
Colbrand
and
she
return
,
I
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
,
certainly
there
be
some
reason
for
my
master
's
caution
:
I
can
make
nothing
of
this
saunter
fellow
;
but
,
to
be
sure
,
there
be
some
roguery
in
the
gipsy
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
if
there
be
,
she
lose
her
aim
,
you
see
!
 
<EOS>
ay
,
very
true
,
say
she
;
but
that
be
owe
to
my
watchfulness
;
and
you
be
very
good
to
go
away
,
when
I
speak
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
hasten
up
stair
to
my
closet
,
and
find
the
billet
to
contain
,
in
a
hand
that
seem
disguise
,
and
bad
spelling
,
the
follow
word
:
   
'
twenty
contrivance
have
be
think
of
to
let
you
know
your
danger
:
<EOS>
but
all
have
prove
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Your
friend
hope
it
be
not
yet
too
late
to
give
you
this
caution
,
if
it
reach
your
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
"
squire
be
absolutely
determine
to
ruin
you
;
and
,
because
he
despair
of
any
other
way
,
he
will
pretend
great
love
and
kindness
to
you
,
and
that
he
will
marry
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
expect
a
parson
,
for
this
purpose
,
in
a
few
day
;
but
it
be
a
sly
artful
fellow
,
of
a
broken
attorney
,
that
he
have
hire
to
personate
a
minister
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
have
a
broad
face
,
pit
much
with
the
small
-
pox
,
and
be
a
very
great
companion
.
 
<EOS>
so
take
care
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
doubt
not
this
advice
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
have
have
but
too
much
reason
already
to
confirm
you
in
the
truth
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
from
your
zealous
well
-
wisher
,
"
somebody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
what
shall
we
say
of
this
truly
diabolical
master
!
 
<EOS>
o
,
how
shall
I
find
word
to
paint
my
griefs
,
and
his
deceit
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
as
good
as
confess
<EOS>
I
love
him
;
but
,
indeed
,
it
be
on
suppose
him
good
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
have
give
him
too
much
advantage
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
will
break
this
wicked
forward
heart
of
mine
,
if
it
will
not
be
teach
to
hate
him
!
 
<EOS>
o
,
what
a
black
dismal
heart
must
he
have
!
 
<EOS>
so
here
be
a
plot
to
ruin
me
,
and
by
my
own
consent
to
!
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
he
do
not
improve
his
wicked
opportunity
,
(
which
I
think
owe
to
remorse
for
his
sin
,
and
compassion
for
me
,
)
when
he
have
such
a
project
as
this
in
reserve
!
 
<EOS>
here
should
I
have
be
delude
with
the
hope
of
a
happiness
that
my
high
ambition
could
have
have
aspire
to
!
 
<EOS>
but
how
dreadful
must
have
be
my
lot
,
when
I
have
find
myself
an
undone
creature
,
and
a
guilty
harlot
,
instead
of
a
lawful
wife
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
too
much
,
too
much
,
for

have
she
search
every
place
she
could

there
be
nothing

say

,
I
could
not
think

she

<EOS>
Saturday
,

o'clock

,
so
,
Pamela
,
we
have
seize
,
it
seem
,
your
treasonable
paper

<EOS>
Treasonable
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
very
sullenly
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
he
,
I
suppose
so
;
for
you
be
a
great
plotter
:
but
I
have
not
read
them
yet
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
say
I
,
very
gravely
,
it
will
be
truly
honourable
in
you
not
to
read
them
;
but
to
give
them
to
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
to
whom
,
say
he
,
be
they
write
?
 
<EOS>
to
my
father
,
sir
;
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
you
see
to
whom
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
return
he
,
I
have
not
read
three
line
yet
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
pray
,
sir
,
do
not
read
them
;
but
give
them
to
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
will
not
,
say
he
,
till
I
have
read
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
serve
me
not
well
in
the
letter
I
use
to
write
formerly
:
I
think
it
be
not
worthy
your
character
to
contrive
to
get
them
in
your
hand
,
by
that
false
John
Arnold
!
<EOS>
for
should
such
a
gentleman
as
you
mind
what
your
poor
servant
write
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
he
,
by
all
mean
,
mind
what
such
a
servant
as
my
Pamela
write
.
  
<EOS>
Your
Pamela
!
<EOS>
think
I.
 
<EOS>
then
the
sham
marriage
come
into
my
head
;
and
indeed
it
have
not
be
out
of
it
,
since
the
gipsy
affair
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
have
you
any
thing
in
these
paper
you
would
not
have
me
see
?
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
say
I
,
there
be
;
for
what
one
write
to
one
's
father
and
mother
,
be
not
for
every
body
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
nor
,
say
he
,
be
I
every
body
.
  
<EOS>
those
letter
,
add
he
,
that
I
do
see
by
John
's
mean
,
be
not
to
your
disadvantage
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
;
for
they
give
me
a
very
high
opinion
of
your
wit
and
innocence
:
<EOS>
and
if
I
have
not
love
you
,
do
you
think
I
would
have
trouble
myself
about
your
letter
?
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
I
,
great
pride
to
me
that
!
 
<EOS>
for
they
give
you
such
an
opinion
of
my
innocence
,
that
you
be
resolve
to
ruin
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
advantage
have
they
bring
me
!
 
<EOS>
who
have
be
make
a
prisoner
,
and
use
as
I
have
be
between
you
and
your
housekeeper
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
a
little
seriously
,
why
this
behaviour
,
for
my
goodness
to
you
in
the
garden
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
of
a
piece
with
your
conduct
and
softness
there
,
that
quite
charm
me
in
your
favour
:
<EOS>
and
you
must
not
give
me
cause
to
think
that
you
will
be
the
more
insolent
,
as
you
find
me
kind
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
I
,
you
know
good
your
own
heart
and
design
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
fear
I
be
too
open
-
hearted
then
;
and
that
you
still
keep
your
resolution
to
undo
me
,
and
have
only
change
the
form
of
your
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
tell
you
once
again
,
say
he
,
a
little
sternly
,
that
you
can
not
oblige
me
more
,
than
by
place
some
confidence
in
me
<EOS>
,
I
will
let
you
know
,
that
these
foolish
and
perverse
doubt
be
the
bad
thing
you
can
be
guilty
of
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
I
shall
possibly
account
for
the
cause
of
them
,
in
these
paper
of
yours
;
for
I
doubt
not
you
have
be
sincere
to
your
father
and
mother
,
though
you
begin
to
make
me
suspect
you
:
<EOS>
for
I
tell
you
,
perverse
girl
,
that
it
be
impossible
you
should
be
thus
cold
and
insensible
,
after
what
have
pass
in
the
garden
,
if
you
be
not
prepossess
in
some
other
person
's
favour
:
and
let
me
add
,
that
if
I
find
it
so
,
it
shall
be
attend
with
such
effect
,
as
will
make
every
vein
in
your
heart
bleed
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
go
away
in
wrath
;
and
I
say
,
one
word
,
good
sir
,
one
word
before
you
read
them
,
since
you
will
read
them
:
pray
make
allowance
 
for
all
the
harsh
reflection
that
you
will
find
in
them
,
on
your
own
conduct
to
me
:
and
remember
only
,
that
they
be
not
write
for
your
sight
;
and
be
pen
by
a
poor
creature
hardly
use
,
and
who
be
in
constant
apprehension
of
receive
from
you
the
bad
treatment
that
you
could
inflict
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
if
that
be
all
,
say
he
,
and
there
be
nothing
of
another
nature
,
that
I
can
not
forgive
,
you
have
no
cause
for
uneasiness
;
for
I
have
as
many
instance
of
your
saucy
reflection
upon
me
in
your
former
letter
,
as
there
be
line
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
you
see
,
I
have
never
upbraid
you
on
that
score
;
though
,
perhaps
,
I
wish
you
have
be
more
sparing
of
your
epithet
,
and
your
freedom
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
I
,
since
you
will
,
you
must
read
them
;
and
I
think
I
have
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
be
find
insincere
,
or
have
,
in
any
respect
,
tell
you
a
falsehood
;
because
,
though
I
do
not
remember
all
I
write
,
yet
<EOS>
I
know
I
write
my
heart
;
and
that
be
not
deceitful
.
 
<EOS>
and
remember
,
sir
,
another
thing
,
that
I
always
declare
I
think
myself
right
to
endeavour
to
make
my
escape
from
this
forced
and
illegal
restraint
;
and
so
you
must
not
be
angry
that
I
would
have
do
so
,
if
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
judge
you
,
never
fear
,
say
he
,
as
favourably
as
you
deserve
;
for
you
have
too
powerful
a
pleader
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
go
down
stair
.
  
<EOS>
about
nine
o'clock
he
send
for
me
down
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
a
little
fearfully
;
and
he
hold
the
paper
in
his
hand
,
and
say
,
now
,
Pamela
,
you
come
upon
your
trial
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
have
a
just
judge
to
hear
my
cause
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
he
,
and
you
may
hope
for
a
merciful
one
too
,
or
else
I
know
not
what
will
become
of
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
expect
,
continue
he
,
that
you
will
answer
me
directly
,
and
plainly
,
to
every
question
I
shall
ask
you
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
here
be
several
love
-
letter
between
you
and
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
love
-
letter
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
I.
 
well
,
call
them
what
you
will
,
say
he
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
entirely
like
them
,
I
will
assure
you
,
with
all
the
allowance
you
desire
me
to
make
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
find
,
sir
,
say
I
,
that
I
encourage
his
proposal
,
or
do
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
you
discourage
his
address
in
appearance
;
but
no
otherwise
than
all
your
cunning
sex
do
to
ours
,
to
make
us
more
eager
in
pursue
you
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
I
,
that
be
your
comment
;
but
it
do
not
appear
so
in
the
text
.
 
<EOS>
Smartly
say
!
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
where
a
d####l
gottest
thou
,
at
these
year
,
all
this
knowledge
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
thou
hast
a
memory
,
as
I
see
by
your
paper
,
that
nothing
escape
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
I
,
what
poor
ability
I
have
,
serve
only
to
make
me
more
miserable
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
my
memory
,
which
impress
thing
upon
me
,
that
I
could
be
glad
never
be
,
or
everlastingly
to
forget
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
so
much
for
that
 
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
account
(
since
you
have
keep
so
exact
a
journal
of
all
that
have
befall
you
)
previous
to
these
here
in
my
hand
?
 
<EOS>
My
father
have
them
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
<EOS>
by
whose
mean
?
<EOS>
say
he
 
<EOS>
by
Mr.
Williams
's
,
say
<EOS>
I.
 
well
answer
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
but
can
not
you
contrive
to
get
me
a
sight
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
that
would
be
pretty
!
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
I.
 
I
wish
I
could
have
contrive
to
have
keep
those
you
have
from
your
sight
.
<EOS>
say
he
,
I
must
see
them
,
Pamela
,
or
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
easy
;
for
I
must
know
how
this
correspondence
between
you
and
Williams
begin
:
and
if
I
can
see
them
,
it
shall
be
well
for
you
,
if
they
answer
what
these
give
me
hope
they
will
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
,
sir
,
very
faithfully
,
say
I
,
what
the
beginning
be
;
for
I
be
bold
enough
to
be
the
beginner
.
 
<EOS>
that
will
not
do
,
say
he
;
for
though
this
may
appear
a
punctilio
to
you
,
to
me
it
be
of
high
importance
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
if
you
please
to
let
me
go
to
my
father
,
I
will
send
them
to
you
by
any
messenger
you
shall
send
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
so
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
,
if
you
will
write
for
them
,
they
will
send
them
to
you
,
without
the
trouble
of
such
a
journey
to
yourself
:
and
I
beg
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
sir
,
say
I
,
as
you
have
see
all
my
former
letter
through
John
's
baseness
,
and
now
these
,
through
your
faithful
housekeeper
's
officious
watchfulness
,
you
may
see
all
the
rest
:
<EOS>
but
I
hope
you
will
not
desire
it
,
till
I
can
see
how
much
my
please
you
in
this
particular
will
be
of
use
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
trust
to
my
honour
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
Pamela
,
say
the
sly
gentleman
,
since
I
have
see
these
,
would
you
have
voluntarily
shew
me
those
,
have
they
be
in
your
possession
?
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
of
this
inference
,
and
say
,
yes
,
truly
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
think
I
should
,
if
you
command
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
as
I
be
sure
you
have
find
mean
to
continue
your
journal
,
I
desire
,
till
the
former
part
can
come
,
that
you
will
shew
me
the
succeeding
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
sir
,
say
I
,
have
you
catch
me
so
?
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
you
must
excuse
me
there
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
tell
me
truly
,
have
you
not
continue
your
account
till
now
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
ask
me
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
<EOS>
but
I
insist
upon
your
answer
,
reply
he
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
sir
,
I
will
not
tell
an
untruth
;
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
good
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
I
love
sincerity
at
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
presume
you
mean
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
I
will
allow
you
to
be
a
little
witty
upon
me
;
because
it
be
in
you
,
and
you
can
not
help
it
:
but
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
,
to
shew
me
voluntarily
what
you
have
write
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
see
the
particular
of
your
plot
,
and
your
disappointment
,
where
your
paper
leave
off
:
for
you
have
so
beautiful
a
manner
,
that
it
be
partly
that
,
and
partly
my
love
for
you
,
that
have
make
me
desirous
of
read
all
you
write
;
<EOS>
though
a
great
deal
of
it
be
against
myself
;
for
which
you
must
expect
to
suffer
a
little
:
<EOS>
and
as
I
have
furnish
you
with
the
subject
,
I
have
a
title
to
see
the
fruit
of
your
pen
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
say
he
,
there
be
such
a
pretty
air
of
romance
,
as
you
relate
them
,
in
your
plot
,
and
my
plot
,
that
I
shall
be
better
direct
in
what
manner
to
wind
up
the
catastrophe
of
the
pretty
novel
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
be
your
equal
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
should
say
this
be
a
very
provoking
way
of
jeer
at
the
misfortune
you
have
bring
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
say
he
,
the
liberty
you
have
take
with
my
character
in
your
letter
,
set
us
upon
a
par
,
at
least
in
that
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
could
not
have
take
those
liberty
,
if
you
have
not
give
me
the
cause
:
and
the
cause
,
sir
,
you
know
,
be
before
the
effect
.
  
<EOS>
True
,
Pamela
,
say
he
;
you
chop
logic
very
prettily
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
deuse
do
we
man
go
to
school
for
?
 
<EOS>
if
our
wit
be
equal
to
woman
's
,
we
may
spare
much
time
and
pain
in
our
education
:
for
nature
teach
your
sex
,
what
,
in
a
long
course
of
labour
and
study
,
ours
can
hardly
attain
to
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
every
lady
be
not
a
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
You
delight
to
banter
your
poor
servant
,
say
I.
  
Nay
<EOS>
,
continue
he
,
I
believe
I
must
assume
to
myself
half
the
merit
of
your
wit
,
too
;
for
the
innocent
exercise
you
have
have
for
it
,
from
me
,
have
certainly
sharpen
your
invention
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
could
I
have
be
without
those
innocent
exercise
,
as
you
be
pleased
to
call
them
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
be
glad
to
have
be
as
dull
as
a
beetle
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
I
should
not
have
love
you
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
sir
,
I
should
have
be
safe
,
easy
,
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
may
be
so
,
and
may
be
not
;
and
the
wife
,
too
,
of
some
clouterly
plough
-
boy
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
,
sir
,
I
should
have
be
content
and
innocent
;
and
that
be
well
than
be
a
princess
,
and
not
so
.
 
<EOS>
and
may
be
not
,
say
he
;
<EOS>
for
if
you
have
have
that
pretty
face
,
some
of
us
keen
fox
-
hunter
should
have
find
you
out
;
and
,
in
spite
of
your
romantic
notion
,
(
which
then
,
too
,
perhaps
,
would
not
have
have
so
strong
a
place
in
your
mind
,
)
may
have
be
more
happy
with
the
ploughman
's
wife
,
than
I
have
be
with
my
mother
's
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
sir
,
say
I
,
God
would
have
give
me
more
grace
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
resume
he
,
as
to
these
writing
of
yours
,
that
follow
your
fine
plot
,
I
must
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
you
must
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
say
he
,
please
me
better
,
than
that
,
in
all
your
art
,
shift
,
and
stratagem
,
you
have
have
a
great
regard
to
truth
;
and
have
,
in
all
your
little
piece
of
deceit
,
tell
very
few
wilful
fib
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
expect
you
will
continue
this
laudable
rule
in
your
conversation
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
know
then
,
where
you
have
find
supply
of
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
when
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
so
vigilant
,
and
give
you
but
two
sheet
at
a
time
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
truth
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
little
do
I
think
I
should
have
such
occasion
for
them
;
but
,
when
I
go
away
from
your
house
,
I
beg
some
of
each
of
good
Mr.
Longman
,
who
give
me
plenty
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
say
he
,
it
must
be
good
Mr.
Longman
!
 
<EOS>
all
your
confederate
be
good
,
every
one
of
them
:
but
such
of
my
servant
as
have
do
their
duty
,
and
obey
my
order
,
be
paint
out
by
you
as
black
as
devil
!
<EOS>
nay
,
so
be
I
too
,
for
that
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
,
but
,
save
yourself
,
do
you
think
they
be
paint
bad
than
they
deserve
?
<EOS>
or
bad
than
the
part
they
act
require
?
  
<EOS>
You
say
,
save
myself
,
Pamela
;
but
be
not
that
say
a
mere
compliment
to
me
,
because
I
be
present
,
and
you
be
in
my
hand
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
truly
.
  
<EOS>
good
sir
,
excuse
me
;
but
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
may
ask
you
,
why
you
should
think
so
,
if
there
be
not
a
little
bit
of
conscience
that
tell
you
,
there
be
but
too
much
reason
for
it
?
  
<EOS>
He
kiss
me
,
and
say
,
I
must
either
do
thus
,
or
be
angry
with
you
;
for
you
be
very
saucy
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
with
your
bewitching
chit
-
chat
,
and
pretty
impertinence
,
I
will
not
lose
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
where
do
you
hide
your
paper
,
pen
,
and
ink
?
  
<EOS>
some
,
sir
,
in
one
place
,
some
in
another
;
that
I
may
have
some
leave
,
if
other
should
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
good
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
;
I
love
you
for
your
sweet
veracity
.
 
<EOS>
now
tell
me
where
it
be
you
hide
your
write
paper
,
your
saucy
journal
?
 
<EOS>
I
must
beg
your
excuse
for
that
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
but
indeed
,
answer
he
,
you
will
not
have
it
:
for
I
will
know
,
and
I
will
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
hard
,
sir
,
say
I
;
but
I
must
say
,
you
shall
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
stand
most
of
this
time
;
but
he
then
sit
down
,
and
take
me
by
both
my
hand
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
well
say
,
my
pretty
Pamela
,
if
you
can
help
it
!
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
let
you
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
,
be
they
in
your
pocket
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
say
I
;
my
heart
up
at
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
will
not
tell
a
downright
fib
for
the
world
:
<EOS>
but
for
equivocation
!
<EOS>
no
jesuit
ever
go
beyond
you
.
 
<EOS>
answer
me
then
,
be
they
in
neither
of
your
pocket
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
be
they
not
<EOS>
,
say
he
,
about
your
stay
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
reply
I
:
but
pray
no
more
question
:
for
ask
me
ever
so
much
,
I
will
not
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
say
he
,
I
have
a
way
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
as
they
do
abroad
,
when
the
criminal
will
not
confess
;
torture
them
till
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
pray
,
sir
,
say
I
,
be
this
fair
,
just
,
or
honest
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
criminal
;
and
I
will
not
confess
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
my
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
many
an
innocent
person
have
be
put
to
the
torture
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
know
where
they
be
,
and
you
shall
escape
the
question
,
as
they
call
it
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
the
torture
be
not
use
in
England
,
and
I
hope
you
will
not
bring
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Admirably
say
!
<EOS>
say
the
naughty
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
tell
you
of
as
good
a
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
criminal
will
not
plead
with
us
,
here
in
England
,
we
press
him
to
death
,
or
till
he
do
plead
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
now
,
Pamela
,
that
be
a
punishment
shall
certainly
be
yours
,
if
you
will
not
tell
without
.
  
<EOS>
tear
stand
in
my
eye
,
and
I
say
,
this
,
sir
,
be
very
cruel
and
barbarous
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
,
say
he
;
it
be
but
like
your
lucifer
,
you
know
,
in
my
shape
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
after
I
have
do
so
many
heinous
thing
by
you
as
you
think
,
you
have
no
great
reason
to
judge
so
hardly
of
this
;
or
,
at
least
,
it
be
<EOS>
but
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
say
I
,
(
dreadfully
afraid
he
have
some
notion
they
be
about
me
,
)
if
you
will
be
obey
in
this
unreasonable
manner
,
though
it
be
sad
tyranny
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
let
me
go
up
to
them
,
and
read
them

and
you
shall
see
so
far
as
to
the
end
of
the
sad
story
that
follow
those
you
have
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
see
them

this
time
,
if
you
have
write
so
far
:
 
or

<EOS>
then
let
me
go

say
I

and
see
what
I
have
write
,
and
to
what
day
,
to
shew
them
to
you
;
for
you
will
not
desire
to
see
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
,
reply
he
.
  
<EOS>
but
say
,
Pamela
,
tell
me
truth
:
be
they
above
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
affright
.
<EOS>
He
see
my
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
truth
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
answer
I
,
I
have
sometimes
hide
them
under
the
dry
mould
in
the
garden
;
sometimes
in
one
place
,
sometimes
in
another
;
and
those
you
have
in
your
hand
,
be
several
day
under
a
rose
-
bush
,
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
artful
slut
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
<EOS>
what
be
this
to
my
question
?
 
<EOS>
be
they
not
about
you
?
 
<EOS>
if
,
say
I
,
I
must
pluck
them
out
of
my
hiding
-
place
behind
the
wainscot
,
will
not
you
see
me
?
  
<EOS>
S
till
more
and
more
artful
!
<EOS>
say
he
 
<EOS>
be
this
an
answer
to
my
question
?
  
<EOS>
I
 
have
search
every
place
above
,
and
in
your
closet
,
for
them
,
and
can
not
find
them
;
so
I
will
know
where
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
say
he
,
it
be
my
opinion
<EOS>
they
be
about
you
;
and
I
never
undress
a
girl
in
my
life
;
but
I
will
now
begin
to
strip
my
pretty
Pamela
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
not
go
far
before
I
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
fall
a
crying
,
and
say
,
I
will
not
be
use
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
say
I
,
(
for
he
begin
to
unpin
my
handkerchief
,
)
consider
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
sir
,
do
!
 
<EOS>
and
pray
,
say
he
,
do
you
consider
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
will
see
these
paper
.
<EOS>
but
may
be
,
say
he
,
they
be
tie
about
your
knee
,
with
your
garter
,
and
stoop
.
 
<EOS>
be
ever
any
thing
so
vile
and
so
wicked
?
 
<EOS>
I
fall
on
my
knee
,
and
say
,
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
let
me
go
up
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
them
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
,
say
he
,
on
your
honour
,
let
me
see
them
uncurtailed
,
and
not
offer
to
make
them
away
;
no
not
a
single
paper
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
on
your
honour
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
let
me
go
up
stair
,
cry
sadly
for
vexation
to
be
so
use
.
 
<EOS>
sure
nobody
be
ever
so
serve
as
I
be
!
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
closet
,
and
there
I
sit
me
down
,
and
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
give
up
my
paper
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
must
all
undress
me
,
in
a
manner
,
to
untack
them
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
writ
thus
:
  
"
SIR
,
  
"
to
expostulate
with
such
an
arbitrary
gentleman
,
I
know
will
signify
nothing
;
and
most
hardly
do
you
use
the
power
you
so
wickedly
have
get
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heart
enough
,
<EOS>
sir
,
to
do
a
deed
that
would
make
you
regret
use
me
thus
;
and
I
can
hardly
bear
it
,
and
what
I
be
further
to
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
superior
consideration
withhold
me
;
thank
God
,
it
do
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
will
,
however
,
keep
my
word
,
if
you
insist
upon
it
when
you
have
read
this
;
but
,
sir
,
let
me
beg
of
you
to
give
me
time
till
to
-
morrow
morning
,
that
I
may
just
run
them
over
,
and
see
what
I
put
into
your
hand
against
me
:
and
I
will
then
give
my
paper
to
you
,
without
the
least
alteration
,
or
add
or
diminish
:
<EOS>
but
I
should
beg
still
to
be
excuse
,
if
you
please
:
<EOS>
but
if
not
,
spare
them
to
me
but
till
to
-
morrow
morning
:
and
this
,
so
hardly
be
I
use
,
shall
be
think
a
favour
,
which
I
shall
be
very
thankful
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
guess
it
would
not
be
long
before
I
hear
from
him
<EOS>
and
he
accordingly
send
up
Mrs.
jewke
for
what
I
have
promise
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
give
her
this
note
to
carry
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
send
word
,
that
I
must
keep
my
promise
,
and
he
would
give
me
till
morning
;
but
that
I
must
bring
them
to
him
,
without
his
ask
again
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
take
off
my
under
-
coat
,
and
with
great
trouble
of
mind
,
unsewe
them
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
vast
quantity
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
just
slightly
touch
upon
the
subject
;
because
I
may
not
,
perhaps
,
get
them
again
for
you
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
They
begin
with
an
account
of
"
my
attempt
to
get
away
out
of
the
window
first
,
and
then
throw
my
petticoat
and
handkerchief
into
the
pond
.
 
<EOS>
how

<EOS>
how

tumble
down

and
be
piteously
bruise
;
the
brick
give
way
,
and
tumble
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
how
,
find
I
could
not
get
off
,
and
dread
the
hard
usage
I
should
receive
,
I
be
so
wicked
as
to
think
of
throw
myself
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
My
sad
reflection
upon

<EOS>
how

and
my

<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
wicked
report
,
to
frighten
me
,
that
I
be

ugly
Swiss

Her

bad

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
how
Mrs.
Jewkes
vilely

to
wickedness

"
<EOS>
and
down
to
here
,
I
put
into
one
parcel
,
hope
that
would
content
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
fear

in
the
most

Mrs.

detestable
part

this
sad

<EOS>
how

forbore
his
abominable

so
ill

<EOS>
how

as
justly
could

clear
myself

how

just

up

sadly

<EOS>
My
free
reflection
upon
this
try
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
bring
down
matter
from
Thursday
,
the
20th
day
of
my
imprisonment
,
to
Wednesday
the
41st
,
and
here
I
be
resolve
to
end
,
let
what
would
come
;
for
only
Thursday
,
Friday
,
and
Saturday
,
remain
to
give
an
account
of
;
and
Thursday
he
set
out
to
a
ball
at
Stamford
;
and
Friday
be
the
gipsy
story
;
and
this
be
Saturday
,
his
return
from
Stamford
.
 
<EOS>
and
truly
,
I
shall
have
but
<EOS>
little
heart
to
write
,
if
he
be
to
see
all
.
  
<EOS>
so
these
two
parcel
of
paper
I
have
get
ready
for
him
against
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
have
always
use
him
very
freely
in
my
writing
,
and
shew
him
no
mercy
<EOS>
;
but
yet
he
must
thank
himself
for
it
;
for
I
have
only
writ
truth
;
and
I
wish
he
have
deserve
a
well
character
at
my
hand
,
as
well
for
his
own
sake
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
though
I
do
not
know
whether
ever
you
will
see
what
I
write
,
I
must
say
,
that
I
will
go
to
bed
,
with
remember
you
in
my
prayer
,
as
I
always
do
,
and
as
I
know
you
do
me
:
<EOS>
and
so
,
my
dear
parent
,
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
what
he
say
,
of
not
be
oblige
to
ask
again
for
my
paper
;
and
what
I
should
be
force
to
do
,
and
could
not
help
,
I
think
I
may
as
well
do
in
such
a
manner
as
may
shew
I
would
not
disoblige
on
purpose
:
though
I
stomach
this
matter
very
heavily
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
get
in
readiness
my
two
parcel
;
and
he
,
not
go
to
church
in
the
morning
,
bid
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
tell
me
he
be
go
into
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
that
be
for
me
to
go
to
him
;
and
so
I
go
:
<EOS>
for
how
can
I
help
be
at
his
beck
?
<EOS>
which
grieve
me
not
a
little
,
though
he
be
my
master
,
as
I
may
say
;
for
I
be
so
wholly
in
his
power
,
that
it
would
do
me
no
good
to
incense
him
;
and
if
I
refuse
to
obey
him
in
little
matter
,
my
refusal
in
great
would
have
the
less
weight
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
down
to
the
garden
;
but
as
he
walk
in
one
walk
,
I
take
another
,
that
I
may
not
seem
too
forward
neither
.
  
<EOS>
He
soon
"
spy
me
,
and
say
,
do
you
expect
to
be
court
to
come
to
me
?
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
and
cross
the
walk
to
attend
him
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
I
should
interrupt
you
in
your
meditation
this
good
day
.
  
<EOS>
be
that
the
case
,
say
he
,
truly
,
and
from
your
heart
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
you
have
very
good
thought
sometimes
,
though
not
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
say
he
,
I
could
avoid
think
so
well
of
you
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
paper
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
have
them
about
you
yesterday
;
for
you
say
in
those
I
have
,
that
you
will
bury
your
writing
in
the
garden
,
for
fear
you
should
be
search
,
if
you
do
not
escape
.
<EOS>
this
,
add
he
,
give
me
a
glorious
pretence
to
search
you
;
and
I
have
be
vex
myself
all
night
,
that
I
do
not
strip
you
garment
by
garment
,
till
I
have
find
them
.
 
<EOS>
o
fie
,
sir
,
say
I
;
let
me
not
be
scare
,
with
hearing
that
you
have
such
a
thought
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
have
not
now
the
paper
to
give
me
;
for
I
have
rather
find
them
myself
,
I
will
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
this
way
of
talk
at
all
;
and
think
it
best
not
to
dwell
upon
it
,
say
,
well
,
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
you
will
excuse
me
,
I
hope
,
give
up
my
paper
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
trifle
with
me
,
say
he
;
<EOS>
where
be
they
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
very
good
to
you
last
night
,
to
humour
you
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
either
add
or
diminish
,
and
have
not
strictly
keep
your
promise
,
woe
be
to
you
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
neither
add
nor
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
parcel
that
go
on
with
my
sad
attempt
to
escape
,
and
the
terrible
consequence
it
have
like
to
have
be
follow
with
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
go
down
to
the
naughty
article
you
send
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
you
know
all
that
have
happen
since
,
I
hope
these
will
satisfy
you
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
speak
;
but
I
say
,
to
drive
him
from
think
of
any
more
,
<EOS>
and
I
must
beg
you
,
sir
,
to
read
the
matter
favourably
,
if
I
have
exceed
in
any
liberty
of
my
pen
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
say
he
,
half
-
smile
,
you
may
wonder
at
my
patience
,
that
I
can
be
so
easy
to
read
myself
abused
as
I
be
by
such
a
saucy
slut
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
wonder
you
should
be
so
desirous
to
see
my
bold
stuff
;
and
,
for
that
very
reason
,
I
have
think
it
a
very
good
,
or
a
very
bad
sign
.
<EOS>
what
,
say
he
,
be
your
good
sign
?
 
<EOS>
that
it
may
have
an
effect
upon
your
temper
,
at
last
,
in
my
favour
,
when
you
see
me
so
sincere
.
 
<EOS>
Your
bad
sign
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
that
if
you
can
read
my
reflection
and
observation
upon
your
treatment
of
me
,
with
tranquillity
,
and
not
be
move
,
it
be
a
sign
of
a
very
cruel
and
determined
heart
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
pray
,
sir
,
do
not
be
angry
at
my
boldness
in
tell
you
so
freely
my
thought
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
,
perhaps
,
say
he
,
be
least
mistaken
,
when
you
think
of
your
bad
sign
.
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
!
<EOS>
say
I.
  
<EOS>
so
I
take
out
my
paper
;
and
say
,
here
,
sir
,
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
please
to
return
them
,
without
break
the
seal
,
it
will
be
very
generous
:
and
I
will
take
it
for
a
great
favour
,
and
a
good
oman
.
  
<EOS>
He
break
the
seal
instantly
,
and
open
them
:
so
much
for
your
oman
!
<EOS>
reply
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
say
I
,
very
seriously
;
and
be
walk
away
.
 
<EOS>
whither
now
?
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
in
,
sir
,
that
you
may
have
time
to
read
them
,
if
you
think
fit
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
them
into
his
pocket
,
and
say
,
You
have
more
than
these
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
:
<EOS>
but
all
they
contain
,
you
know
as
well
as
i.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
,
say
he
,
the
light
you
put
thing
in
;
and
so
give
them
me
,
if
you
have
not
a
mind
to
be
search
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
can
not
stay
,
if
you
will
not
forbear
that
ugly
world
.
 
<EOS>
give
me
then
no
reason
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
the
other
paper
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
unkind
sir
,
if
it
must
be
so
,
here
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
give
him
,
out
of
my
pocket
,
the
second
parcel
,
seal
up
,
as
the
former
,
with
this
superscription
;
from
the
naughty
article
,
down
,
through
sad
attempt
,
to
Thursday
the
42d
day
of
my
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
last
Thursday
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
;
but
now
you
will
see
what
I
write
,
I
will
find
some
other
way
to
employ
my
time
:
for
how
can
I
write
with
any
face
,
what
must
be
for
your
perusal
,
and
not
for
those
I
intend
to
read
my
melancholy
story
?
  
<EOS>
yes
,
say
he
,
I
would
have
you
continue
your
penmanship
by
all
mean
;
and
,
I
assure
you
,
in
the
mind
I
be
in
,
I
will
not
ask
you
for
any
after
these
;
except
any
thing
very
extraordinary
occur
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
another
thing
to
tell
you
,
add
he
,
that
if
you
send
for
those
from
your
father
,
and
let
me
read
them
,
I
may
,
very
probably
,
give
them
all
back
again
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
desire
you
will
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
a
little
encourage
me
to
continue
my
scribbling
;
but
,
for
fear
of
the
bad
,
I
will
,
when
they
come
to
any
bulk
,
contrive
some
way
to
hide
them
,
if
I
can
,
that
I
may
protest
I
have
them
not
about
me
,
which
,
before
,
I
could
not
say
of
a
truth
;
and
that
make
him
so
resolutely
bent
to
try
to
find
them
upon
me
;
for
which
I
may
have
suffer
frightful
indecency
.
  
<EOS>
He
lead
me
,
then
,
to
the
side
of
the
pond
;
and
sit
down
on
the
slope
,
make
me
sit
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
say
he
,
this
be
the
scene
of
part
of
your
project
,
and
where
you
so
artfully
throw
in
some
of
your
clothe
<EOS>
,
I
will
just
look
upon
that
part
of
your
relation
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
let
me
then
walk
about
,
at
a
little
distance
;
for
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
go
far
,
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
,
as
I
suppose
,
to
the
place
where
I
mention
the
brick
fall
upon
me
,
he
get
up
,
and
walk
to
the
door
,
and
look
upon
the
broken
part
of
the
wall
;
for
it
have
not
be
mend
;
and
come
back
,
read
on
to
himself
,
towards
me
;
and
take
my
hand
,
and
put
it
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
this
,
say
he
,
my
girl
,
be
a
very
moving
tale
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
desperate
attempt
,
and
,
have
you
get
out
,
you
may
have
be
in
great
danger
;
for
you
have
a
very
bad
and
lonely
way
;
and
I
have
take
such
measure
,
that
,
let
you
have
be
where
you
would
,
I
should
have
have
you
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
see
,
sir
,
say
I
,
what
I
venture
,
rather
than
be
ruin
;
and
you
will
be
so
good
as
hence
to
judge
of
the
sincerity
of
my
profession
,
that
my
honesty
be
dearer
to
me
than
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
romantic
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
and
read
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
very
serious
at
my
reflection
,
on
what
God
have
enable
me
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
come
to
my
reasoning
about
throw
myself
into
the
water
,
he
say
,
Walk
gently
before
;
and
seem
so
moved
,
that
he
turn
away
his
face
from
me
;
and
I
bless
this
good
sign
,
and
begin
not
so
much
to
repent
at
his
see
this
mournful
part
of
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
paper
in
his
pocket
,
when
he
have
read
my
reflection
,
and
thank
for
escape
from
myself
;
and
say
,
take
me
about
the
waist
,
o
my
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
you
have
touch
me
sensibly
with
your
mournful
relation
,
and
your
sweet
reflection
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
truly
have
be
very
miserable
have
it
take
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
have
be
use
too
roughly
;
and
it
be
a
mercy
you
stand
proof
in
that
fatal
moment
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
most
kindly
fold
me
in
his
arm
:
<EOS>
let
us
,
say
I
too
,
my
Pamela
,
walk
from
this
accurse
piece
of
water
;
for
I
shall
not
,
with
pleasure
,
look
upon
it
again
,
to
think
how
near
it
be
to
have
be
fatal
to
my
fair
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
add
he
,
of
terrify
you
to
my
will
,
since
I
could
not
move
you
by
love
;
and
Mrs.
jewke
too
well
obey
me
,
when
the
terror
of
your
return
,
after
your
disappointment
,
be
so
great
,
that
you
have
hardly
courage
to
withstand
them
;
but
have
like
to
have
make
so
fatal
a
choice
,
to
escape
the
treatment
you
apprehend
.
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
reason
,
I
be
sure
,
to
bless
my
dear
parent
,
and
my
good
lady
,
your
mother
,
for
give
me
something
of
a
religious
education
;
for
,
but
for
that
,
and
God
's
grace
,
<EOS>
I
should
,
more
than
upon
one
occasion
,
have
attempt
,
at
least
,
a
desperate
act
:
<EOS>
and
I
the
less
wonder
how
poor
creature
,
who
have
not
the
fear
of
God
before
their
eye
,
and
give
way
to
despondency
,
cast
themselves
into
perdition
.
  
<EOS>
come
,
kiss
me
,
say
he
,
and
tell
me
you
forgive
me
for
push
you
into
so
much
danger
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
if
my
mind
hold
,
and
I
can
see
those
former
paper
of
yours
,
and
that
these
in
my
pocket
give
me
no
cause
to
altar
my
opinion
<EOS>
,
I
will
endeavour
to
defy
the
world
and
the
world
's
censure
,
and
make
my
Pamela
amend
,
if
it
be
in
the
power
of
my
whole
life
,
for
all
the
hardship
I
have
make
her
undergo
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
look
well
;
but
you
shall
see
how
strangely
it
be
all
turn
.
<EOS>
for
this
sham
-
marriage
then
come
into
my
mind
again
;
and
I
say
,
Your
poor
servant
be
far
unworthy
of
this
great
honour
;
for
what
will
it
be
but
to
create
envy
to
herself
,
and
discredit
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
sir
,
permit
me
to
return
to
my
poor
parent
,
and
that
be
all
I
have
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
fearful
passion
then
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
it
thus
,
say
he
,
in
my
fond
conceding
moment
,
that
I
be
to
be
despise
and
answer
?
 
<EOS>
precise
,
perverse
,
unseasonable
Pamela
!
<EOS>
begone
from
my
sight
!
<EOS>
and
know
as
well
how
to
behave
in
a
hopeful
prospect
,
as
in
a
distressful
state
;
and
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
shalt
thou
attract
the
shadow
of
my
notice
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
startled
,
and
go
to
speak
:
but
he
stamp
with
his
foot
,
and
say
,
Begone
!
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
:
I
can
not
bear
this
stupid
romantic
folly
.
  
<EOS>
one
word
,
say
I
;
but
one
word
,
I
beseech
you
,
sir
.
  
<EOS>
He
turn
from
me
in
great
wrath
,
and
take
down
another
alley
,
and
so
I
go
,
with
a
very
heavy
heart
;
and
fear
I
be
too
unseasonable
,
just
at
a
time
when
he
be
so
condescend
:
but
if
it
be
a
piece
of
art
of
his
side
,
as
I
apprehend
,
to
introduce
the
sham
-
wedding
,
(
and
,
to
be
sure
,
he
be
very
full
of
stratagem
and
art
,
)
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
not
so
much
to
blame
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
up
to
my
closet
;
and
write
thus
far
,
while
he
walk
about
till
dinner
be
ready
;
and
he
be
now
sit
down
to
it
,
as
I
hear
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
very
sullen
,
thoughtful
,
and
out
of
humour
;
and
she
ask
,
what
I
have
do
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
now
,
again
,
I
dread
to
see
him
!
 
<EOS>
when
will
my
fear
be
over
?
  
<EOS>
three
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
he
continue
exceed
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
order
his
travel
chariot
to
be
get
ready
with
all
speed
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
come
next
,
I
wonder
!
  
<EOS>
sure
I
do
not
say
so
much
!
 
<EOS>
but
see
the
lordliness
of
a
high
condition
!
  
<EOS>
a
 
poor
body
must
not
put
in
a
word
,
when
they
take
it
into
their
head
to
be
angry
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
fine
time
a
person
of
an
equal
condition
would
have
of
it
,
if
she
be
even
to
marry
such
a
one
!
 
<EOS>
His
poor
dear
mother
spoil
him
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
must
speak
to
him
or
contradict
him
,
as
I
have
hear
,
when
he
be
a
child
;
and
so
he
have
not
be
use
to
be
control
,
and
can
not
bear
the
least
thing
that
cross
his
violent
will
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
blessing
attend
man
of
high
condition
!
<EOS>
much
good
may
do
them
with
their
pride
of
birth
,
and
pride
of
fortune
!
<EOS>
say
I
:
 
all
that
it
serve
for
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
be
,
to
multiply
their
disquiet
,
and
every
body
be
else
that
have
to
do
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
so
!
<EOS>
where
will
this
end
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
be
with
me
from
him
,
and
she
say
,
I
must
get
out
of
the
house
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
but
whither
be
I
to
be
carry
next
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
home
,
say
she
,
to
your
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
and
can
it
be
?
<EOS>
say
I
;
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
I
doubt
I
shall
not
be
so
happy
as
that
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
some
bad
design
be
on
foot
again
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
sure
,
sure
,
say
I
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
he
have
not
find
out
some
other
housekeeper
bad
than
you
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
angry
,
you
may
well
think
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
she
can
not
be
make
bad
than
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
She
come
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
ready
?
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
bless
me
,
say
I
,
you
be
very
hasty
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
this
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
soon
ready
;
<EOS>
for
I
have
but
little
to
take
with
me
,
and
no
kind
friend
in
this
house
to
take
leave
of
,
to
delay
me
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
like
a
fool
,
I
can
not
help
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
say
I
,
just
step
down
,
and
ask
,
if
I
may
not
have
my
paper
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
I
be
quite
ready
now
,
against
<EOS>
she
come
up
with
an
answer
;
and
so
I
will
put
up
these
few
writing
in
my
bosom
,
that
I
have
leave
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
think
 
nor
how
to
judge
;
but
I
shall
never
believe
I
be
with
you
,
till
I
be
on
my
knee
before
you
,
beg
both
your
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
be
sorry
he
be
so
angry
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
do
not
say
so
much
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
I
see
,
the
chariot
draw
out
,
the
horse
too
,
the
grim
Colbrand
go
to
get
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
what
will
be
the
end
of
all
this
?
  
<EOS>
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
where
this
will
end
,
I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
I
be
,
at
a
little
poor
village
,
almost
such
a
one
as
yours
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
learn
the
name
of
it
by
and
by
:
and
Robin
assure
me
,
he
have
order
to
carry
me
to
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
o
that
he
may
say
truth
,
and
not
deceive
me
again
!
<EOS>
but
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
and
I
be
sure
I
shall
not
sleep
a
wink
to
-
night
,
if
I
be
to
go
to
bed
,
I
will
write
my
time
away
,
and
take
up
my
story
where
I
leave
off
,
on
Sunday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
up
to
me
,
with
this
answer
about
my
paper
:
My
master
say
,
he
will
not
read
them
yet
,
lest
he
should
be
move
by
any
thing
in
them
to
alter
his
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
he
should
think
it
worth
while
to
read
them
,
he
will
send
them
to
you
,
afterwards
,
to
your
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
she
,
here
be
your
guinea
that
I
borrow
:
for
all
be
over
now
with
you
,
I
find
.
  
<EOS>
She
see
me
cry
,
and
say
,
do
you
repent
?
 
<EOS>
of
what
?
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
I.
 
Nay
,
I
can
not
tell
,
reply
she
;
but
,
to
be
sure
,
he
have
have
a
taste
of
your
satirical
fling
,
or
he
would
not
be
so
angry
.
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
continue
she
,
and
hold
up
her
hand
,
<EOS>
thou
hast
a
spirit
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
it
will
now
be
bring
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
too
,
say
I.
  
<EOS>
well
,
add
I
,
I
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
She
lift
up
the
window
,
and
say
,
I
will
call
Robin
to
take
your
portmanteau
:
<EOS>
Bag
and
baggage
!
<EOS>
proceed
she
<EOS>
,
I
be
glad
you
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
word
,
say
I
,
to
throw
away
upon
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
but
,
make
her
a
very
low
courtesy
,
I
most
heartily
thank
you
for
all
your
virtuous
civility
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
adieu
<EOS>
;
for
I
will
have
no
portmanteau
,
I
will
assure
you
,
nor
any
thing
but
these
few
thing
that
I
bring
with
me
in
my
handkerchief
,
besides
what
I
have
on
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
all
this
time
wear
my
own
buy
clothe
,
though
my
master
would
have
have
it
otherwise
often
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
put
up
paper
,
ink
,
and
pen
,
however
.
  
<EOS>
so
down
I
go
,
and
as
I
pass
by
the
parlour
,
she
step
in
,
and
say
,
Sir
,
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
the
girl
before
she
go
?
 
<EOS>
I
hear
him
reply
,
though
I
do
not
see
him
,
<EOS>
who
bid
you
say
,
the
girl
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
in
that
manner
?
 
<EOS>
She
have
offend
only
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
your
honour
's
pardon
,
say
the
wretch
;
but
if
I
be
your
honour
,
she
should
not
,
for
all
the
trouble
she
have
cost
you
,
go
away
scot
-
free
.
<EOS>
no
more
of
this
,
as
I
tell
you
before
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
when
I
have
such
proof
,
that
her
virtue
be
all
her
pride
,
shall
I
rob
her
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
add
he
,
let
her
go
,
perverse
and
foolish
as
she
be
;
but
she
deserve
to
go
honest
,
and
she
shall
go
so
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
transported
with
this
unexpected
goodness
,
that
I
open
the
door
before
I
know
what
I
do
;
and
say
,
fall
on
my
knee
at
the
door
,
with
my
hand
fold
,
and
lift
up
,
o
thank
you
,
thank
your
honour
,
a
million
of
time
!
 
<EOS>
May
God
bless
you
for
this
instance
of
your
goodness
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
pray
for
you
as
long
as
I
live
,
and
so
shall
my
dear
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
I
will
pray
for
you
too
,
poor
wicked
wretch
that
you
be
!
  
<EOS>
He
turn
from
me
,
and
go
into
his
closet
,
and
shut
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
nee
not
have
do
so
;
for
I
would
not
have
go
near
to
him
!
  
<EOS>
surely
I
do
not
say
so
much
,
to
incur
all
this
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
loath
to
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
believe
it
?
 
<EOS>
what
could
be
the
matter
with
me
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
I
feel
something
so
strange
,
and
my
heart
be
so
lumpish
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
ail
me
!
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
so
unexpected
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
be
all
!
 
<EOS>
yet
I
be
very
strange
still
.
<EOS>
surely
,
surely
,
I
can
not
be
like
the
old
murmuring
Israelites
,
to
long
after
the
onion
and
garlick
of
Egypt
,
when
they
have
suffer
there
such
heavy
bondage
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
thee
,
o
lumpish
,
contradictory
,
ungovernable
heart
!
<EOS>
to
severe
task
,
for
this
thy
strange
impulse
,
when
I
get
to
my
dear
father
's
and
mother
's
;
and
if
I
find
any
thing
in
thee
that
should
not
be
,
depend
upon
it
thou
shalt
be
humble
,
if
strict
abstinence
,
prayer
,
and
mortification
,
will
do
it
!
  
<EOS>
but
yet
,
after
all
,
this
last
goodness
of
his
have
touch
me
too
sensibly
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
not
hear
it
,
almost
;
and
yet
,
methink
,
I
be
glad
I
do
;
for
I
should
rejoice
to
think
the
good
of
him
,
for
his
own
sake
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
I
go
out
to
the
chariot
,
the
same
that
bring
me
down
.
<EOS>
so
,
Mr.
Robert
,
say
I
,
here
I
be
again
!
<EOS>
a
poor
sporting
-
piece
for
the
great
!
<EOS>
a
mere
tennis
-
ball
of
fortune
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
your
order
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
yes
,
madam
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
now
,
say
I
,
do
not
madam
me
,
nor
stand
with
your
hat
off
to
such
a
one
as
I.
 
<EOS>
have
not
my
master
,
say
he
,
order
me
not
to
be
want
in
respect
to
you
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
shew
you
all
I
could
.
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
with
my
heart
full
,
that
be
very
kind
,
Mr.
Robert
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Colbrand
,
mount
on
horseback
,
with
pistol
before
him
,
come
up
to
me
,
as
soon
as
I
get
in
,
with
his
hat
off
too
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
monsieur
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
be
you
to
go
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
part
of
the
way
,
he
say
,
to
see
you
safe
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
that
be
kind
too
,
in
you
,
Mr.
Colbrand
,
say
I.
  
I
have
nobody
to
wave
my
handkerchief
to
now
,
nor
to
take
leave
of
;
and
so
I
resign
myself
to
my
contemplation
,
with
this
strange
wayward
heart
of
mine
,
that
I
never
find
so
ungovernable
and
awkward
before
.
  
<EOS>
so
away
drive
the
chariot
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
get
out
of
the
elm
-
walk
,
and
into
the
great
road
,
I
could
hardly
think
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
a
dream
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
hour
before
,
in
my
master
's
arm
almost
,
with
twenty
kind
thing
say
to
me
,
and
a
generous
concern
for
the
misfortune
he
have
bring
upon
me
;
and
only
by
one
rash
half
-
word
exasperate
against
me
,
and
turn
out
of
door
,
at
an
hour
's
warning
;
and
all
his
kindness
change
to
hate
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
now
,
from
three
o'clock
to
five
,
several
mile
off
!
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
go
to
you
,
all
will
be
well
again
,
I
hope
.
  
<EOS>
lack
-
a
-
day
,
what
strange
creature
be
man
!
<EOS>
gentleman
,
I
should
say
,
rather
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
my
dear
deserve
good
mother
,
though
poverty
be
both
your
lot
,
have
have
better
hap
,
and
you
be
,
and
have
always
be
,
blest
in
one
another
!
 
<EOS>
yet
this
please
me
too
;
he
be
so
good
<EOS>
,
he
would
not
let
Mrs.
Jewkes
speak
ill
of
me
,
and
scorn
to
take
her
odious
unwomanly
advice
.
<EOS>
o
,
what
a
black
heart
have
this
poor
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
so
I
need
not
rail
against
man
so
much
;
for
my
master
,
bad
as
I
have
think
him
,
be
not
half
so
bad
as
this
woman
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
she
must
be
an
atheist
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
she
be
not
?
  
<EOS>
We
could
not
reach
further
than
this
little
poor
place
and
sad
alehouse
,
rather
than
inn
;
for
it
begin
to
be
dark
,
and
Robin
do
not
make
so
much
haste
as
he
may
have
do
;
and
he
be
force
to
make
hard
shift
for
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Colbrand
,
and
Robert
too
,
be
very
civil
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
he
have
get
my
portmanteau
lash
behind
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
desire
it
;
but
I
shall
not
come
quite
empty
.
  
<EOS>
a
thorough
riddance
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
see
!
 
<EOS>
Bag
and
baggage
!
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
.
<EOS>
well
,
my
story
surely
would
furnish
out
a
surprising
kind
of
novel
,
if
it
be
to
be
well
tell
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Robert
come
up
to
me
,
just
now
,
and
beg
me
to
eat
something
:
<EOS>
I
thank
him
;
but
say
,
I
could
not
eat
.
 
<EOS>
I
bid
him
ask
Mr.
Colbrand
to
walk
up
;
and
he
come
;
but
neither
of
them
would
sit
;
nor
put
their
hat
on
.
 
<EOS>
what
mockado
be
this
,
to
such
a
poor
soul
as
I
!
 
<EOS>
I
ask
them
,
if
they
be
at
liberty
to
tell
me
the
truth
of
what
they
be
to
do
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
if
not
,
I
would
not
desire
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
say
,
Robin
be
order
to
carry
me
to
my
father
's
;
and
Mr.
Colbrand
be
to
leave
me
within
ten
mile
,
and
then
strike
off
for
the
other
house
,
and
wait
till
my
master
arrive
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
speak
so
solemnly
,
that
I
could
not
but
believe
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Robin
go
down
,
the
other
say
,
he
have
a
letter
to
give
me
next
day
at
noon
,
when
we
bait
,
as
we
be
to
do
,
at
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
relation
's
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
not
,
say
I
,
beg
the
favour
to
see
it
to
-
night
?
 
<EOS>
He
seem
so
loath
to
deny
me
,
that
I
have
hope
I
shall
prevail
on
him
by
and
by
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
have
get
the
letter
,
on
great
promise
of
secrecy
,
and
make
no
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
if
I
can
open
it
without
break
the
seal
,
and
will
take
a
copy
of
it
by
and
by
;
for
Robin
be
in
and
out
:
there
be
hardly
any
room
in
this
little
house
for
one
to
be
long
alone
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
this
be
the
letter
:
  
<EOS>
"
when
these
line
be
deliver
to
you
,
you
will
be
far
on
your
way
to
your
father
and
mother
,
where
you
have
so
long
desire
to
be
:
and
,
I
hope
,
I
shall
forbear
thinking
of
you
with
the
least
shadow
of
that
fondness
my
foolish
heart
have
entertain
for
you
:
<EOS>
I
bear
you
,
however
,
no
ill
will
;
but
the
end
of
my
detaining
you
be
over
,
I
would
not
that
you
should
tarry
with
me
an
hour
more
than
need
,
after
the
ungenerous
preference
you
give
,
at
a
time
that
I
be
inclined
to
pass
over
all
other
consideration
,
for
an
honourable
address
to
you
;
for
well
I
find
the
table
entirely
turn
upon
me
,
and
that
I
be
in
far
more
danger
from
you
,
than
you
be
from
me
;
for
I
be
just
upon
resolve
to
defy
all
the
censure
of
the
world
,
and
to
make
you
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
acknowledge
another
truth
:
that
,
have
I
not
part
with
you
as
I
do
,
but
permit
you
to
stay
till
I
have
read
your
journal
,
reflect
,
as
I
doubt
not
I
shall
find
it
,
and
till
I
have
hear
your
bewitching
plea
in
your
own
behalf
,
I
fear
I
could
not
trust
myself
with
my
own
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
reason
<EOS>
,
I
frankly
own
,
that
I
have
determine
not
to
see
you
,
nor
hear
you
speak
;
for
well
I
know
my
weakness
in
your
favour
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
get
the
well
of
this
fond
folly
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
hope
I
have
already
do
it
,
since
it
be
likely
to
cost
me
so
dear
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
write
this
to
tell
you
,
that
I
wish
you
well
with
all
my
heart
,
though
you
have
spread
such
mischief
through
my
family
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
can
not
but
say
that
I
could
wish
you
would
not
think
of
marry
in
haste
;
and
,
particularly
,
that
you
would
not
have
this
curse
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
all
this
to
me
now
?
 
<EOS>
only
,
my
weakness
make
me
say
,
that
as
I
have
already
look
upon
you
as
mine
,
and
you
have
so
soon
get
rid
of
your
first
husband
;
so
you
will
not
refuse
,
to
my
memory
,
the
decency
that
every
common
person
observe
,
to
pay
a
twelvemonth
's
compliment
,
though
but
a
mere
compliment
,
to
my
ashe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
paper
shall
be
faithfully
return
you
;
and
I
have
pay
so
dear
for
my
curiosity
in
the
affection
they
have
rivette
upon
me
for
you
,
that
you
would
look
upon
yourself
amply
revenge
if
you
know
what
they
have
cost
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
write
only
a
few
line
;
but
I
have
run
into
length
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
try
to
recollect
my
scatter
thought
,
and
resume
my
reason
;
and
shall
find
trouble
enough
to
replace
my
affair
,
and
my
own
family
,
and
to
supply
the
chasm
you
have
make
in
it
:
for
,
let
me
tell
you
,
though
I
can
forgive
you
,
I
never
can
my
sister
,
nor
my
domestic
;
for
my
vengeance
must
be
wreak
somewhere
.

"
I
doubt
not
your
prudence
in
forbear
to
expose
me
any
more
than
be
necessary
for
your
own
justification
;
and
for
that
I
will
suffer
myself
to
be
accuse
by
you
,
and
will
also
accuse
myself
,
if
it
be
needful

ever

"
  
<EOS>
this
letter
,
when
I
expect
some
new
plot
,
have
affect
me
more
than
any
thing
of
that
sort
could
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
for
here
be
plainly
his
great
value
for
me
confess
,
and
his
rigorous
behaviour
account
for
in
such
a
manner
,
as
torture
me
much
.
 
<EOS>
and
all
this
wicked
gipsy
story
be
,
as
it
seem
,
a
forgery
upon
us
both
,
and
have
quite
ruin
me
:
<EOS>
for
,
o
my
dear
parent
,
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
but
I
find
,
to
my
grief
,
before
,
that
my
heart
be
too
partial
in
his
favour
;
but
now
with
so
much
openness
,
so
much
affection
;
nay
,
so
much
honour
too
,
(
<EOS>
which
be
all
I
have
before
doubt
,
and
keep
me
on
the
reserve
,
)
<EOS>
I
be
quite
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
happiness
,
however
,
I
have
no
reason
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
be
sure
,
I
must
own
to
you
,
that
I
shall
never
be
able
to
think
of
any
body
in
the
world
but
him
.
  
<EOS>
presumption
!
<EOS>
you
will
say
;
and
so
it
be
:
<EOS>
but
love
be
not
a
voluntary
thing
:
love
,
do
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
but
come
<EOS>
,
I
hope
not
:
 
<EOS>
at
least
it
be
not
,
I
hope
,
go
so
far
as
to
make
me
very
uneasy
:
<EOS>
for
I
know
not
how
it
come
,
nor
when
it
begin
;
but
creep
,
creep
it
have
,
like
a
thief
,
upon
me
;
and
before
I
know
what
be
the
matter
,
it
look
like
love
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
,
since
it
be
too
late
,
and
my
lot
determine
,
that
I
have
not
have
this
letter
,
nor
hear
him
take
my
part
to
that
vile
woman
;
for
then
I
should
have
bless
myself
in
have
escape
so
happily
his
design
art
upon
my
virtue
:
but
now
my
poor
mind
be
all
topsy
-
turvie
,
and
I
have
make
an
escape
to
be
more
a
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
hope
,
since
thus
it
be
,
that
all
will
be
for
the
good
;
and
I
shall
,
with
your
prudent
advice
,
and
pious
prayer
,
be
able
to
overcome
this
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
will
keep
a
long
time
than
a
twelvemonth
,
as
a
true
widow
,
for
a
compliment
,
and
more
than
a
compliment
,
to
your
ashe
!
 
<EOS>
o
the
dear
word
!
 
<EOS>
how
kind
,
how
move
,
how
affectionate
be
the
word
!
 
<EOS>
o
why
be
I
not
a
duchess
,
to
shew
my
gratitude
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
but
must
labour
under
the
weight
of
an
obligation
,
even
have
this
happiness
befall
me
,
that
would
have
press
me
to
death
,
and
which
I
never
could
return
by
a
whole
life
of
faithful
love
,
and
cheerful
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
o
forgive
your
poor
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
find
this
trial
so
sore
upon
me
;
and
that
all
the
weakness
of
my
weak
sex
,
and
tender
year
,
who
never
before
know
what
it
be
to
be
so
touched
,
be
come
upon
me
,
and
too
mighty
to
be
withstand
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
time
,
prayer
,
and
resignation
to
God
's
will
,
and
the
benefit
of
your
good
lesson
,
and
example
,
I
hope
,
will
enable
me
to
get
over
this
so
heavy
a
trial
.
  
<EOS>
o
my
treacherous
,
treacherous
heart
!
<EOS>
to
serve
me
thus
!
<EOS>
and
give
no
notice
to
me
of
the
mischiefs
thou
wast
about
to
bring
upon
me
!
 
<EOS>
but
thus
foolishly
to
give
thyself
up
to
the
proud
invader
,
without
ever
consult
thy
poor
mistress
in
the
least
!
 
<EOS>
but
thy
punishment
will
be
the
first
and
the
great
;
and
well
deservest
thou
to
smart
,
o
perfidious
traitor
!
<EOS>
for
give
up
so
weakly
thy
whole
self
,
before
a
summon
come
;
and
to
one
,
too
,
who
have
use
me
so
hardly
;
and
when
,
likewise
,
thou
hadst
so
well
maintain
thy
post
against
the
most
violent
and
avow
,
and
,
therefore
,
as
I
think
,
more
dangerous
attack
!
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
must
either
not
shew
you
this
my
weakness
,
or
tear
it
out
of
my
writing

Memorandum
:
to
consider
of
this
,
when
I
get
home
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
morning
,
eleven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
just
come
in
here
,
to
the
inn
keep
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
relation
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
compliment
I
have
,
be
in
a
very
impudent
manner
,
how
I
like
the
"
squire
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
say
,
Bold
,
forward
woman
!
 
<EOS>
be
it
for
you
,
who
keep
an
inn
,
to
treat
passenger
at
this
rate
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
but
in
jest
,
she
say
,
and
ask
pardon
:
<EOS>
and
she
come
,
and
beg
excuse
again
,
very
submissively
,
after
Robin
and
Mr.
Colbrand
have
talk
to
her
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
the
latter
here
,
in
great
form
,
give
me
,
before
Robin
,
the
letter
which
I
have
give
him
back
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
retire
,
as
if
to
read
it
;
and
so
I
do
;
for
I
think
I
can
not
read
it
too
often
;
though
,
for
my
peace
of
mind
's
sake
,
I
may
better
try
to
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
,
methink
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
bring
you
back
a
sound
heart
;
but
,
indeed
,
it
be
an
honest
one
,
as
to
any
body
but
me
;
for
it
have
deceive
nobody
else
:
wicked
thing
that
it
be
!
  
<EOS>
More
and
more
surprising
thing
still
     
just
as
I
have
sit
down
,
to
try
to
eat
a
bit
of
victual
,
to
get
ready
to
pursue
my
journey
,
come
in
Mr.
Colbrand
in
a
mighty
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
o
madam
!
<EOS>
madam
!
<EOS>
say

,
here
be
de
groom
from
de
"
Squire
B

all
over

a
lather
,

and

<EOS>
o
how

pit
-
a

pat
!
 
<EOS>
what
now

think
<EOS>
I
,
be
to
come
next

<EOS>
He
go
out
,
and
presently
return
with
a
letter
for
me
,
and
another
,
enclose
,
for
Mr.
Colbrand
.
 
<EOS>
this
seem
odd
,
and
put
me
all
in
a
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
shut
the
door
;
and
never
,
sure
,
be
the
like
known
!
<EOS>
find
the
follow
agreeable
content
:
    
<EOS>
"
in
vain
,
my
Pamela
,
do
I
find
it
to
struggle
against
my
affection
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
needs
,
after
you
be
go
,
venture
to
entertain
myself
with
your
Journal
,
when
I
find
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
bad
usage
of
you
,
after
your
dreadful
temptation
and
hurt
;
and
particularly
your
generous
concern
for
me
,
on
hear
how
narrowly
I
escape
drown
;
(
though
my
death
would
have
be
your
freedom
,
and
I
have
make
it
your
interest
to
wish
it
)
;
and
your
most
agreeable
confession
in
another
place
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
my
hard
usage
of
you
,
you
could
not
hate
me
;
and
that
express
in
so
sweet
,
so
soft
,
and
so
innocent
a
manner
,
that
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
you
may
be
bring
to
love
me
:
(
together
with
the
other
part
of
your
admirable
Journal
:
)
<EOS>
I
begin
to
repent
my
parting
with
you
;
but
,
God
be
my
witness
!
<EOS>
for
no
unlawful
end
,
as
you
would
call
it
;
but
the
very
contrary
:
and
the
rather
,
as
all
this
be
improve
in
your
favour
,
by
your
behaviour
at
leave
my
house
:
<EOS>
for
,
oh
!
<EOS>
that
melodious
voice
pray
for
me
at
your
departure
,
and
thank
me
for
my
rebuke
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
still
hang
upon
my
ear
,
and
delight
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
and
though
I
go
to
bed
,
I
could
not
rest
;
but
about
two
get
up
,
and
make
Thomas
get
one
of
the
good
horse
ready
,
in
order
to
set
out
to
overtake
you
,
while
I
sit
down
to
write
this
to
you

"
now
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
let
me
beg
of
you
,
on
the
receipt
of
this
,
to
order
Robin
to
drive
you
back
again
to
my
house

<EOS>
I
would
have
set
out
myself
,
for
the
pleasure
of
bear
you
company
back
in
the
chariot
;
but
be
really
indisposed
;
I
believe
,
with
vexation
that
I
should
part
thus
with
my
soul
's
delight
,
as
I
now
find
you
be
,
and
must
be
,
in
spite
of
the
pride
of
my
own
heart

"
You
can
not
imagine
the
obligation
your
return
will
lay
me
under
to
your
goodness
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
you
will
not
so
far
favour
me
,
you
shall
be
under
no
restraint
,
as
you
will
see
by
my
letter
enclose
to
Colbrand
;
which
I
have
not
seal
,
that
you
may
read
it

<EOS>

spare
me
,
my
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
the
confusion
of
follow
you
to
your
father
's
;
which
I
must
do
,
if
you
persist
to
go
on
;
for
I
find
I
can
not
live
a
day
without
you

if
you
be
the
generous
Pamela
I
imagine
you
to
be
,
(
for
hitherto
you
have
be
all
goodness
,
where
it
have
not
be
merit
,
)
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
by
this
new
instance
,
the
further
excellence
of
your
disposition
;
let
me
see
you
can
forgive
the
man
who
love
you
more
than
himself
;
let
me
see
,
by
it
,
that
you
be
not
prepossess
in
any
other
person
's
favour
:
<EOS>
and
one
instance
more
I
would
beg
,
and
then
I
be
all
gratitude
;
and
that
is
,
that
you
would
despatch
Monsieur
Colbrand
with
a
letter
to
your
father
,
assure
him
that
all
will
end
happily
;
and
to
desire
,
that
he
will
send
to
you

at
my

the
letter
you
find
mean

by
Williams
's
conveyance

to
send
him

when
I
have
all
my
proud

perhaps
,
punctilious
doubt
answer
,
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do

to
make
you
happy

and
be
so
myself

three
o'clock

o
my
exulting
heart
!
<EOS>
how
it
throb
in
my
bosom
,
as
if
it
would
reproach
me
for
so
lately
upbraid
it
for
give
way
to
the
love
of
so
dear
a
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
but
take
care
thou
art
<EOS>
not
too
credulous
neither
,
o
fond
believer

<EOS>
thing
that
we
wish
,
be
apt
to
gain
a
too
ready
credence
with
us

<EOS>
this
sham

marriage
be
not
yet
clear
up
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
the
vile
Mrs.
Jewkes

<EOS>
may
yet
instigate
the
mind
of
this
master
:
<EOS>
His
pride
of
heart
,
and
pride
of
condition
,
may
again
take
place
:
and
a
man
that
could
in
so
little
a
space
,
first
love
me
,
then
hate
,
then
banish
me
his
house
,
and
send
me
away
disgracefully
;
and
now
send
for
me
again
,
in
such
affectionate
term
,
may
still
waver
,
may
still
deceive
thee
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
will
I
not
acquit
thee
yet

O
credulous

flutter

throb
mischief

art
so
ready

I
charge
thee
to
keep
well

flattering

Colbrand
;
which
be
in
these
word
:
    
"
<EOS>
MONSIEUR
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
will
excuse
the
trouble
I
give
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
for
good
reason
,
change
my
mind
;
and
I
have
beseech
it
,
as
a
favour
,
that
Mrs.
Andrews
will
return
to
me
the
moment
Tom
reach
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
for
the
reason
I
have
give
her
,
she
will
have
the
goodness
to
oblige
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
not
,
you
be
to
order
Robin
to
pursue
his
direction
,
and
set
her
down
at
her
father
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
will
oblige
me
in
her
return
,
perhaps
she
will
give
you
a
letter
to
her
father
,
for
some
paper
to
be
deliver
to
you
for
her
;
which
you
will
be
so
good
,
in
that
case
,
to
bring
to
her
here
:
<EOS>
but
if
she
will
not
give
you
such
a
letter
,
you
will
return
with
her
to
me
,
if
she
please
to
favour
me
so
far
;
and
that
with
all
expedition
,
that
her
health
and
safety
will
permit
;
for
I
be
pretty
much
indisposed
;
but
hope
it
will
be
but
slight
,
and
soon
go
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
   
<EOS>
"
your
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
second
thought
,
let
Tom
go
forward
with
Mrs.
Andrews
's
letter
,
if
she
please
to
give
one
;
and
you
return
with
her
,
for
her
safety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
this
be
a
dear
generous
manner
of
treat
me
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
love
to
be
generously
use
!
 
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
parent
,
I
wish
I
could
consult
you
for
your
opinion
,
how
I
should
act
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
go
back
,
or
should
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
have
get
too
great
hold
in
my
heart
,
for
me
to
be
easy
presently
,
if
I
should
refuse
:
<EOS>
and
yet
this
gipsy
information
make
me
fearful
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
,
I
think
,
trust
in
his
generosity
!
 
<EOS>
yet
be
it
not
too
great
a
trust
?
 
<EOS>
especially
consider
how
I
have
be
use
!
 
<EOS>
but
then
that
be
while
he
avow
his
bad
design
;
and
now
he
give
great
hope
of
his
good
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
may
be
the
mean
of
make
many
happy
,
as
well
as
myself
,
by
place
a
generous
confidence
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
think
,
he
may
have
send
to
Colbrand
,
or
to
Robin
,
to
carry
me
back
,
whether
I
would
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
different
be
his
behaviour
to
that
!
 
<EOS>
and
would
it
not
look
as
if
I
be
prepossess
,
as
he
call
it
,
if
I
do
not
oblige
him
;
and
as
if
it
be
a
silly
female
piece
of
pride
,
to
make
him
follow
me
to
my
father
's
;
and
as
if
I
would
use
him
hardly
in
my
turn
,
for
his
have
use
me
ill
in
his
?
 
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
resolve
to
obey
him
;
and
if
he
use
me
ill
afterwards
,
double
will
be
his
ungenerous
guilt
!
 
<EOS>
though
hard
will
be
my
lot
,
to
have
my
credulity
so
justly
blamable
,
as
it
will
then
seem
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
to
be
sure
,
the
world
,
the
wise
world
,
that
never
be
wrong
itself
,
judge
always
by
event
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
should
use
me
ill
,
then
I
shall
be
blame
for
trust
him
:
<EOS>
if
well
,
o
then
I
do
right
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
but
how
would
my
censurer
act
in
my
case
,
before
the
event
justify
or
condemn
the
action
,
be
the
question
?
  
<EOS>
then
I
have
no
notion
of
oblige
by
half
;
but
of
do
thing
with
a
grace
,
as
one
may
say
,
where
they
be
to
be
do
;
and
so
I
write
the
desire
letter
to
you
,
assure
you
,
that
I
have
before
me
happy
prospect
than
ever
I
have
;
and
hope
all
would
end
well
:
and
that
I
beg
you
would
send
me
,
by
the
bearer
,
Mr.
Thomas
,
my
master
's
groom
,
those
paper
,
which
I
have
send
you
by
Mr.
Williams
's
conveyance
:
for
that
they
import
me
much
,
for
clear
up
a
point
in
my
conduct
,
that
my
master
be
desirous
to
know
,
before
he
resolve
to
favour
me
,
as
he
have
intend
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
have
that
letter
,
before
you
can
have
this
;
for
I
would
not
send
you
this
without
the
preceding
;
which
now
be
in
my
master
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
have
give
the
letter
to
Mr.
Thomas
for
him
to
carry
to
you
,
when
he
have
bait
and
rest
after
his
great
fatigue
,
I
send
for
Monsieur
Colbrand
,
and
Robin
,
and
give
to
the
former
his
letter
;
and
when
he
have
read
it
,
I
say
,
You
see
how
thing
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
to
return
to
our
master
;
and
as
he
be
not
so
well
as
be
to
be
wish
,
the
more
haste
you
make
the
well
:
and
do
not
mind
my
fatigue
,
but
consider
only
yourself
,
and
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Robin
,
who
guess
the
matter
,
by
his
conversation
with
Thomas
,
(
as
I
suppose
,
)
say
,
God
bless
you
,
madam
,
and
reward
you
,
as
your
obligingness
to
my
good
master
deserve
;
and
may
we
all
live
to
see
you
triumph
over
Mrs.
Jewkes
!
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
to
hear
him
say
so
;
for
I
be
always
careful
of
expose
my
master
,
or
even
that
naughty
woman
,
before
the
common
servant
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
I
question
whether
Robin
would
have
say
this
,
if
he
have
not
guess
,
by
Thomas
's
message
,
and
my
resolving
to
return
,
that
I
may
stand
well
with
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
so
selfish
be
the
heart
of
poor
mortal
,
that
they
be
ready
to
change
as
favour
go
!
  
<EOS>
so
they
be
not
long
get
ready
;
and
I
be
just
set
out
,
back
again
:
and
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
have
no
reason
to
repent
it
.
  
<EOS>
Robin
put
on
very
vehemently
;
and
when
we
come
to
the
little
town
,
where
we
lie
on
Sunday
night
,
he
give
his
horse
a
bait
,
and
say
,
he
would
push
for
his
master
's
that
night
,
as
it
would
be
moon
-
light
,
if
I
should
not
be
too
much
fatigued
because
there
be
no
place
between
that
and
the
town
adjacent
to
his
master
's
,
fit
to
put
up
at
,
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
Monsieur
Colbrand
's
horse
begin
to
give
way
,
make
a
doubt
between
them
:
wherefore
<EOS>
I
say
,
(
hate
to
be
on
the
road
,
)
if
it
could
be
do
,
I
should
bear
it
well
enough
,
I
hope
;
and
that
Monsieur
Colbrand
may
leave
his
horse
,
when
it
fail
,
at
some
house
,
and
come
into
the
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
this
please
them
both
;
and
,
about
twelve
mile
short
,
he
leave
the
horse
,
and
take
off
his
spur
and
holster
,
etc
.
<EOS>
and
,
with
abundance
of
ceremonial
excuse
,
come
into
the
chariot
;
and
I
sit
the
easy
for
it
;
for
my
bone
ache
sadly
with
the
jolting
,
and
so
many
mile
travel
in
so
few
hour
,
as
I
have
do
,
from
Sunday
night
,
five
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
this
,
it
be
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
when
we
come
to
the
village
adjacent
to
my
master
's
;
and
the
horse
begin
to
be
very
much
tired
,
and
Robin
too
:
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
It
would
be
pity
to
put
up
only
three
mile
short
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
so
about
one
we
reach
the
gate
;
but
every
body
be
a
-
bed
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
of
the
helper
get
the
key
from
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
open
the
gate
;
and
the
horse
could
hardly
crawl
into
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
,
when
I
go
to
get
out
of
the
chariot
,
fall
down
,
and
think
I
have
lose
the
use
of
my
limb
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
down
with
her
clothe
huddle
on
,
and
lift
up
her
hand
and
eye
,
at
my
return
;
but
shew
more
care
of
the
horse
than
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
time
the
two
maid
come
;
and
I
make
shift
to
creep
in
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
my
poor
master
be
very
ill
indeed
,
and
have
be
upon
the
bed
most
part
of
the
day
;
and
Abraham
(
who
succeed
John
)
sit
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
get
into
a
fine
sleep
,
and
hear
not
the
coach
come
in
,
nor
the
noise
we
make
;
for
his
chamber
lie
towards
the
garden
,
 
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
He
have
a
feverish
complaint
,
and
have
be
blooded
;
and
,
very
prudently
,
order
Abraham
,
when
he
awake
,
not
to
tell
him
I
be
come
,
for
fear
of
surprise
him
,
and
augment
his
fever
;
nor
,
indeed
,
to
say
any
thing
of
me
,
till
she
herself
break
it
to
him
in
the
morning
,
as
she
should
see
how
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
bed
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
after
she
have
cause
me
to
drink
almost
half
a
pint
of
burn
wine
,
make
very
rich
and
cordial
,
with
spice
;
<EOS>
which
I
find
very
refreshing
,
and
set
me
into
a
sleep
I
little
hope
for
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
get
up
pretty
early
,
I
have
write
thus
far
,
while
Mrs.
Jewkes
lie
snore
in
bed
,
fetch
up
her
last
night
's
disturbance
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
for
her
rise
,
to
know
how
my
poor
master
do
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
well
for
her
she
can
sleep
so
purely
.
 
<EOS>
no
love
,
but
for
herself
,
will
ever
break
her
rest
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
deadly
sore
all
over
,
as
if
I
have
be
soundly
beat
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
could
have
live
under
such
fatigue
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
as
soon
as
she
get
up
,
go
to
know
how
my
master
do
,
and
he
have
have
a
good
night
;
and
,
have
drink
plentifully
of
sack
whey
,
have
sweat
much
;
so
that
his
fever
have
abate
considerably
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
to
him
,
that
he
must
not
be
surprised
,
and
she
would
tell
him
news
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
,
<EOS>
what
?
 
<EOS>
and
she
say
,
I
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
raise
himself
up
in
his
bed
;
Can
it
be
?
<EOS>
say
he
 
<EOS>
what
,
already
!
 
<EOS>
She
tell
him
I
come
last
night
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
Colbrand
come
to
inquire
of
his
health
,
he
order
him
to
draw
near
him
,
and
be
highly
pleased
with
the
account
he
give
him
of
the
journey
,
my
readiness
to
come
back
,
and
my
willingness
to
reach
home
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
why
,
these
tender
fair
one
,
I
think
,
bear
fatigue
better
than
us
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
very
good
,
to
give
me
such
an
instance
of
her
readiness
to
oblige
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
he
,
take
great
care
of
her
health
!
<EOS>
and
let
her
be
a
-
bed
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
him
I
have
be
up
these
two
hour
.
 
<EOS>
ask
her
,
say
he
,
if
she
will
be
so
good
as
to
make
me
a
visit
:
if
she
will
not
,
I
will
rise
,
and
go
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
she
,
you
must
be
still
;
and
I
will
go
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
urge
her
too
much
,
say
he
,
if
she
be
unwilling
.
  
<EOS>
She
come
to
me
,
and
tell
me
all
the
above
;
and
I
say
,
I
would
most
willingly
wait
upon
him
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
long
to
see
him
,
and
be
much
grieve
he
be
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
down
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Will
she
come
?
<EOS>
say
he
,
as
I
enter
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
we
;
and
she
say
,
at
the
first
word
,
most
willingly
.
 
<EOS>
sweet
excellence
!
<EOS>
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
see
me
,
he
say
,
o
my
beloved
Pamela
!
<EOS>
you
have
make
me
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
concerned
to
return
my
acknowledgment
to
you
in
so
unfit
a
place
and
manner
;
but
will
you
give
me
your
hand
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
and
he
kiss
it
with
great
eagerness
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
do
me
too
much
honour
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
be
sorry
you
be
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
ill
,
say
he
,
while
you
be
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
already
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
and
kiss
my
hand
again
<EOS>
,
you
shall
not
repent
this
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
be
too
full
of
it
to
express
myself
as
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
sorry
you
have
have
such
a
fatiguing
time
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
life
be
no
life
without
you
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
refuse
me
,
and
yet
I
have
hardly
hope
you
would
oblige
me
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
have
a
severe
fit
of
it
,
I
believe
;
for
I
be
take
very
oddly
,
and
know
not
what
to
make
of
myself
:
but
now
I
shall
be
well
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
add
he
,
send
for
the
doctor
from
Stamford
,
as
we
talk
yesterday
;
for
this
lovely
creature
be
my
doctor
,
as
her
absence
be
my
disease
.
  
<EOS>
He
beg
me
to
sit
down
by
his
bed
-
side
,
and
ask
me
,
if
I
have
oblige
him
with
send
for
my
former
packet
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
have
,
and
hope
it
would
be
bring
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
doubly
kind
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
stay
long
because
of
disturb
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
get
up
in
the
afternoon
,
and
desire
my
company
;
and
seem
quite
pleased
,
easy
,
and
much
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
after
this
instance
of
my
good
Pamela
's
obligingness
in
her
return
,
I
be
sure
we
ought
to
leave
her
entirely
at
her
own
liberty
;
and
pray
,
if
she
please
to
take
a
turn
in
our
chariot
,
or
in
the
garden
,
or
to
the
town
,
or
wherever
she
will
,
let
her
be
leave
at
liberty
,
and
ask
no
question
;
and
do
you
do
all
in
your
power
to
oblige
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
she
would
,
to
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
my
hand
,
and
say
,
one
thing
I
will
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
because
I
know
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
it
,
and
yet
not
care
to
ask
me
:
<EOS>
I
have
,
before
you
go
,
take
Williams
's
bond
for
the
money
;
for
how
the
poor
man
have
behave
I
can
not
tell
,
but
he
could
get
no
bail
;
and
if
I
have
no
fresh
reason
give
me
,
perhaps
I
shall
not
exact
the
payment
;
and
he
have
be
some
time
at
liberty
,
and
now
follow
his
school
;
but
,
methink
<EOS>
,
I
could
wish
you
would
not
see
him
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
will
not
do
any
thing
to
disoblige
you
wilfully
;
and
I
be
glad
he
be
at
liberty
,
because
I
be
the
occasion
of
his
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
durst
say
no
more
,
though
I
want
to
plead
for
the
poor
gentleman
;
<EOS>
which
,
in
gratitude
,
I
think
I
ought
,
when
I
could
do
him
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
sorry
,
sir
,
Lady
Davers
,
who
love
you
so
well
,
should
have
incur
your
displeasure
,
and
that
there
should
be
any
variance
between
your
honour
and
her
<EOS>
;
I
hope
it
be
not
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
as
he
sit
in
his
gown
,
his
letter
-
case
,
and
say
,
here
,
<EOS>
Pamela
,
read
that
when
you
go
up
stair
,
and
let
me
have
your
thought
upon
it
;
and
that
will
let
you
into
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
very
heavy
of
a
sudden
,
and
would
lie
down
,
and
indulge
for
that
day
;
and
if
he
be
well
in
the
morning
,
would
take
an
airing
in
the
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
take
my
leave
for
the
present
,
and
go
up
to
my
closet
,
and
read
the
letter
he
be
pleased
to
put
into
my
hand
;
which
be
as
follow
:
    
"
BROTHER
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
uneasy
at
what
I
hear
of
you
;
and
must
write
,
whether
it
please
you
or
not
,
my
full
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
some
people
with
me
,
desire
me
to
interpose
with
you
;
and
they
have
a
great
regard
for
your
honour
,
than
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
,
you
have
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
think
,
that
a
brother
of
mine
would
so
meanly
run
away
with
my
late
dear
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
,
and
keep
her
a
prisoner
from
all
her
friend
,
and
to
the
disgrace
of
your
own
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
,
when
you
would
not
let
the
wench
come
to
me
on
my
mother
's
death
,
that
you
mean
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
blush
for
you
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
be
an
innocent
,
good
girl
;
but
I
suppose
that
be
over
with
her
now
,
or
soon
will
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
you
mean
by
this
,
let
me
ask
you
?
 
<EOS>
either
you
will
have
her
for
a
keep
mistress
,
or
for
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
former
,
there
be
enough
to
be
have
without
ruin
a
poor
wench
that
my
mother
love
,
and
who
really
be
a
very
good
girl
:
<EOS>
and
of
this
you
may
be
ashamed
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
other
,
I
dare
say
you
do
not
think
of
it
;
but
if
you
should
,
you
would
be
utterly
inexcusable
.
 
<EOS>
consider
,
brother
,
<EOS>
that
our
be
no
upstart
family
;
but
be
as
ancient
as
the
good
in
the
kingdom
!
<EOS>
and
,
for
several
hundred
of
year
,
it
have
never
be
know
,
that
the
heir
of
it
have
disgrace
themselves
by
unequal
match
:
<EOS>
and
you
know
you
have
be
seek
to
by
some
of
the
good
family
in
the
nation
,
for
your
alliance
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
enough
,
if
you
be
descend
of
a
family
of
yesterday
,
or
but
a
remove
or
two
from
the
dirt
you
seem
so
fond
of
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
I
,
and
all
mine
,
will
renounce
you
for
ever
,
if
you
can
descend
so
meanly
;
and
I
shall
be
ashamed
to
be
call
your
sister
.
 
<EOS>
a
handsome
man
,
as
you
be
,
in
your
person
;
so
happy
in
the
gift
of
your
mind
,
that
every
body
court
your
company
;
and
possess
of
such
a
noble
and
clear
estate
;
and
very
rich
in
money
besides
,
leave
you
by
the
good
of
father
and
mother
,
with
such
ancient
blood
in
your
vein
,
untainted
!
<EOS>
for
you
to
throw
away
yourself
thus
,
be
intolerable
;
and
it
would
be
very
wicked
in
you
to
ruin
the
wench
too
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
I
beg
you
will
restore
her
to
her
parent
,
and
give
her
100l
.
<EOS>
or
so
,
to
make
her
happy
in
some
honest
fellow
of
her
own
degree
;
and
that
will
be
do
something
,
and
will
also
oblige
and
pacify
                                        
"
Your
much
grieve
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
write
too
sharply
,
consider
it
be
my
love
to
you
,
and
the
shame
you
be
bring
upon
yourself
;
and
I
wish
this
may
have
the
effect
upon
you
,
intend
by
your
very
loving
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
sad
letter
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
;
and
one
may
see
how
poor
people
be
despise
by
the
proud
and
the
rich
!
<EOS>
and
yet
we
be
all
on
a
foot
originally
:
<EOS>
and
many
of
these
gentry
,
that
brag
of
their
ancient
blood
,
would
be
glad
to
have
it
as
wholesome
,
and
as
really
untainted
,
as
our
!
 
<EOS>
surely
these
proud
people
never
think
what
a
short
stage
life
be
;
and
that
,
with
all
their
vanity
;
a
time
be
come
,
when
they
shall
be
oblige
to
submit
to
be
on
a
level
with
us
:
and
true
say
the
philosopher
,
when
he
look
upon
the
skull
of
a
king
,
and
that
of
a
poor
man
,
that
he
see
no
difference
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
do
they
not
know
,
that
the
rich
of
prince
,
and
the
poor
of
beggar
,
be
to
have
one
great
and
tremendous
judge
,
at
the
last
day
;
who
will
not
distinguish
between
them
,
accord
to
their
circumstance
in
life
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
may
make
their
condemnation
the
great
,
as
their
neglect
opportunity
be
the
great
?
 
<EOS>
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
how
do
I
pity
their
pride
!
  
<EOS>
o
keep
me
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
from
their
high
condition
,
if
my
mind
shall
ever
be
taint
with
their
vice
!
<EOS>
or
pollute
with
so
cruel
and
inconsiderate
a
contempt
of
the
humble
estate
which
they
behold
with
so
much
scorn
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
besides
,
how
do
these
gentry
know
,
that
,
suppose
they
could
trace
back
their
ancestry
for
one
,
two
,
three
,
or
even
five
hundred
year
,
that
then
the
original
stem
of
these
poor
family
,
though
they
have
not
keep
such
elaborate
record
of
their
good
-
for
nothingness
,
as
it
often
prove
,
be
not
still
deeper
root
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
can
they
be
assure
,
that
one
hundred
year
hence
,
or
two
,
some
of
those
now
despise
upstart
family
may
not
revel
in
their
estate
,
while
their
descendant
may
be
reduce
to
the
other
'
dunghill
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
such
be
the
vanity
,
as
well
as
changeableness
,
of
human
estate
,
in
their
turn
set
up
for
pride
of
family
,
and
despise
the
other
!
  
<EOS>
these
reflection
occur
to
my
thought
,
make
serious
by
my
master
's
indisposition
,
and
this
proud
letter
of
the
lowly
Lady
Davers
,
against
the
high
-
minded
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
lowly
,
I
say
,
because
she
could
stoop
to
such
vain
pride
;
and
high
-
minded
I
,
because
I
hope
I
be
too
proud
ever
to
do
the
like
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
poor
wretch
that
we
be
!
<EOS>
we
scarce
know
what
we
be
,
much
less
what
we
shall
be
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
once
more
pray
I
to
be
keep
from
the
sinful
pride
of
a
high
estate
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
I
recall
the
follow
line
,
which
I
have
read
;
where
the
poet
argue
in
a
much
well
manner
:
        
"
 
W
ise
Providence
     
<EOS>
do
various
part
for
various
mind
dispense
:
     
<EOS>
the
mean
slave
,
or
those
who
hedge
and
ditch
<EOS>
,
     
be
useful
,
by
their
sweat
,
to
feed
the
rich
.
     
<EOS>
the
rich
,
in
due
return
,
impart
their
store
;
     
which
comfortably
feed
the
lab'ring
poor
.
     
<EOS>
nor
let
the
rich
the
low
slave
disdain
:
     
<EOS>
He
be
equally
a
link
of
Nature
's
chain
:
     
Labours
to
the
same
end
,
join
in
one
view
;
     
and
both
alike
the
will
divine
pursue
;
     
and
,
at
the
last
,
be
levell'd
,
king
and
slave
,
     
<EOS>
without
distinction
,
in
the
silent
grave
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
send
me
a
message
just
now
,
that
he
be
so
much
well
,
that
he
would
take
a
turn
,
after
breakfast
,
in
the
chariot
,
and
would
have
me
give
him
my
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
know
how
to
be
humble
,
and
comport
myself
as
I
should
do
,
under
all
these
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
one
of
the
most
obliging
creature
in
the
world
;
and
I
have
such
respect
shew
me
by
every
one
,
as
if
I
be
as
great
as
Lady
Davers
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
if
this
should
all
end
in
the
sham
-
marriage
!
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
yet
the
pride
of
greatness
and
ancestry
,
and
such
-
like
,
be
so
strongly
set
out
in
Lady
Davers
's
letter
,
that
I
can
not
flatter
myself
to
be
so
happy
as
all
these
desirable
appearance
make
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
be
now
deceive
,
I
should
be
bad
off
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
see
what
light
this
new
honour
will
procure
me
!
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
get
ready
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
,
I
think
,
change
my
garb
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
do
it
<EOS>
,
it
would
look
as
if
I
would
be
near
on
a
level
with
him
:
and
yet
,
<EOS>
should
I
not
,
it
may
be
think
a
disgrace
to
him
:
but
I
will
,
I
think
,
open
the
portmanteau
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
come
hither
,
put
on
my
good
silk
nightgown
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
that
will
be
make
myself
a
sort
of
right
to
the
clothe
I
have
renounce
;
and
I
be
not
yet
quite
sure
I
shall
have
no
other
crosse
to
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
go
as
I
be
;
for
,
though
ordinary
,
I
be
as
clean
as
a
penny
,
though
I
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
e'en
go
as
I
be
,
except
he
order
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
yet
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
I
ought
to
dress
as
fine
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
as
my
master
be
up
,
and
at
breakfast
,
I
will
venture
down
to
ask
him
how
he
will
have
me
be
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
he
be
kind
and
kinder
,
and
,
thank
God
,
purely
recover
!
 
<EOS>
how
charmingly
he
look
,
to
what
he
do
yesterday
!
 
<EOS>
Blessed
be
God
for
it
!
  
<EOS>
He
arise
,
and
come
to
me
,
and
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
would
set
me
down
by
him
;
and
he
say
,
My
charming
girl
seem
go
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
what
would
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
(
a
little
ashamed
,
)
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
too
great
an
honour
to
go
into
the
chariot
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
he
;
the
pleasure
of
your
company
will
be
great
than
the
honour
of
mine
;
and
so
say
no
more
on
that
head
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
shall
disgrace
you
to
go
thus
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
grace
a
prince
,
my
fair
-
one
,
say
the
good
,
kind
,
kind
gentleman
!
<EOS>
in
that
dress
,
or
any
you
shall
choose
:
<EOS>
and
you
look
so
pretty
,
that
,
if
you
shall
not
catch
cold
in
that
round
-
eared
cap
,
you
shall
go
just
as
you
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
say
I
,
then
you
will
be
pleased
to
go
a
bye
-
way
,
that
it
may
not
be
see
you
do
so
much
honor
to
your
servant
.
 
<EOS>
o
my
good
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
you
be
afraid
of
yourself
be
talk
of
,
more
than
me
:
<EOS>
for
I
hope
by
degree
to
take
off
the
world
's
wonder
,
and
teach
them
to
expect
what
be
to
follow
,
as
a
due
to
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
o
the
dear
good
man
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
for
you
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
 
<EOS>
do
I
not
do
well
now
to
come
back
?
 
<EOS>
o
could
I
get
rid
of
my
fear
of
this
sham
-
marriage
,
(
for
all
this
be
not
yet
inconsistent
with
that
frightful
scheme
,
)
<EOS>
I
should
be
too
happy
!
  
<EOS>
so
I
come
up
,
with
great
pleasure
,
for
my
glove
:
and
now
wait
his
kind
command
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
say
I
to
myself
,
as
if
I
be
speak
to
him
,
for
God
's
sake
<EOS>
let
me
have
no
more
trial
and
reverse
;
for
I
could
not
bear
it
now
,
I
verily
think
!
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
welcome
message
come
,
that
my
master
be
ready
;
and
so
I
go
down
as
fast
as
I
could
;
and
he
,
before
all
the
servant
,
hand
me
in
,
as
if
I
be
a
lady
;
and
then
come
in
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
beg
he
would
take
care
<EOS>
he
do
not
catch
cold
,
as
he
have
be
ill
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
pride
to
hear
his
new
coachman
say
,
to
one
of
his
fellow
-
servant
,
They
be
a
charming
pair
,
I
be
sure
!
'
<EOS>
tis
pity
they
should
be
part
!
 
<EOS>
o
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
 
<EOS>
I
fear
your
girl
will
grow
as
proud
as
any
thing
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
especially
,
you
will
think
I
have
reason
to
guard
against
it
,
when
you
read
the
kind
particular
I
be
go
to
relate
.
  
<EOS>
He
order
dinner
to
be
ready
by
two
;
and
Abraham
,
who
succeed
John
,
go
behind
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
He
bid
Robin
drive
gently
,
and
tell
me
,
he
want
to
talk
to
me
about
his
sister
daver
,
and
other
matter
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
at
first
set
out
he
kiss
me
a
little
too
often
,
that
he
do
;
and
I
be
afraid
of
Robin
's
look
back
,
through
the
fore
-
glass
,
and
people
see
us
,
as
they
pass
;
but
he
be
exceedingly
kind
to
me
,
in
his
word
,
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
say
,
  
You
have
,
I
doubt
not
,
read
,
over
and
over
,
my
sister
's
saucy
letter
;
and
find
,
as
I
tell
you
,
that
you
be
no
more
obliged
to
her
than
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
she
intimate
,
that
some
people
have
be
with
her
;
and
who
should
they
be
,
but
the
officious
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Mr.
Longman
,
and
Jonathan
!
<EOS>
and
so
that
have
make
me
take
the
measure
I
do
in
dismiss
them
my
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
say
he
,
you
be
go
to
speak
on
their
behalfs
;
but
your
time
be
not
come
to
do
that
,
if
ever
I
shall
permit
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
,
say
he
,
I
have
be
beforehand
with
;
for
I
have
renounce
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
be
a
kind
brother
to
her
;
and
give
her
to
the
value
of
3000l
.
<EOS>
more
than
her
share
come
to
by
my
father
's
will
,
when
I
enter
upon
my
estate
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
woman
,
surely
,
be
beside
herself
with
passion
and
insolence
,
<EOS>
when
she
write
me
such
a
letter
;
for
well
she
know
I
would
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
know
,
Pamela
,
that
she
be
much
incensed
,
that
I
will
give
no
ear
to
a
proposal
of
hers
,
of
a
daughter
of
my
Lord
#
#
#
#
,
 
<EOS>
who
,
say
he
,
neither
in
person
,
or
mind
,
or
acquirement
,
even
with
all
her
opportunity
,
be
to
be
name
in
a
day
with
my
Pamela
.
<EOS>
but
yet
you
see
the
plea
,
my
girl
,
which
I
make
to
you
before
,
of
the
pride
of
condition
,
and
the
world
's
censure
,
which
,
I
own
,
stick
a
little
too
close
with
me
still
:
for
a
woman
shine
not
forth
to
the
public
as
man
;
and
the
world
see
not
your
excellency
and
perfection
:
<EOS>
if
it
do
,
I
should
entirely
stand
acquit
by
the
severe
censure
.
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
take
in
the
lump
;
that
here
be
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
with
such
and
such
an
estate
,
have
marry
his
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
:
not
consider
there
be
not
a
lady
in
the
kingdom
that
can
out
-
do
her
,
or
well
support
the
condition
to
which
she
will
be
raise
,
if
I
should
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
say
he
,
put
his
arm
round
me
,
and
again
kiss
me
<EOS>
,
I
pity
my
dear
girl
too
,
for
her
part
in
this
censure
;
for
,
here
will
she
have
to
combat
the
pride
and
slight
of
the
neighbour
gentry
all
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
Sister
Davers
,
you
see
,
will
never
be
reconcile
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
lady
will
not
visit
you
;
and
you
will
,
with
a
merit
superior
to
them
all
,
be
treat
as
if
unworthy
their
notice
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
now
marry
my
Pamela
,
how
will
my
girl
relish
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
will
not
these
be
cut
thing
to
my
fair
-
one
?
<EOS>
for
,
as
to
me
,
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
,
with
a
good
estate
in
possession
,
to
brazen
out
the
matter
of
my
former
pleasantry
on
this
subject
,
with
my
companion
of
the
chase
,
the
green
,
and
the
assemblee
;
stand
their
rude
jest
for
once
or
twice
,
and
my
fortune
will
create
me
always
respect
enough
,
I
warrant
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
say
,
what
will
my
poor
girl
do
,
as
to
her
part
,
with
her
own
sex
?
 
<EOS>
for
some
company
you
must
keep
.
<EOS>
My
station
will
not
admit
it
to
be
with
my
servant
;
and
the
lady
will
fly
your
acquaintance
;
and
still
,
though
my
wife
,
will
treat
you
as
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
what
say
my
girl
to
this
?
  
<EOS>
You
may
well
guess
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
how
transport
these
kind
,
these
generous
and
condescending
sentiment
be
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
the
harmony
of
the
sphere
all
around
me
;
and
every
word
that
drop
from
his
lip
be
as
sweet
as
the
honey
of
Hybla
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
I
,
how
inexpressibly
kind
and
good
be
all
this
!
 
<EOS>
Your
poor
servant
have
a
much
great
struggle
than
this
to
go
through
,
a
more
knotty
difficulty
to
overcome
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
say
he
,
a
little
impatiently
:
<EOS>
I
will
not
forgive
your
doubt
now
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
can
not
doubt
;
but
it
be
,
how
I
shall
support
,
how
I
shall
deserve
your
goodness
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
and
hug
me
to
his
breast
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
you
would
have
make
me
angry
again
;
but
that
I
would
not
be
,
because
I
see
you
have
a
grateful
heart
;
and
this
your
kind
and
cheerful
return
,
after
such
cruel
usage
as
you
have
experience
in
my
house
,
enough
to
make
you
detest
the
place
,
have
make
me
resolve
to
bear
any
thing
in
you
,
but
doubt
of
my
honour
,
at
a
time
when
I
be
pour
out
my
soul
,
with
a
true
and
affectionate
ardour
,
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
good
sir
,
say
I
,
my
great
concern
will
be
for
the
rude
jest
you
will
have
yourself
to
encounter
with
,
for
thus
stoop
beneath
yourself
.
<EOS>
for
,
as
to
me
,
consider
my
lowly
estate
,
and
little
merit
,
even
the
slight
and
reflection
of
the
lady
will
be
an
honour
to
me
:
and
I
shall
have
the
pride
to
place
more
than
half
their
ill
will
to
their
envy
at
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
can
,
by
the
most
cheerful
duty
,
and
resign
obedience
,
have
the
pleasure
to
be
agreeable
to
you
<EOS>
,
I
shall
think
myself
but
too
happy
,
let
the
world
say
what
it
will
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
You
be
very
good
,
<EOS>
my
dear
girl
!
 
<EOS>
but
how
will
you
bestow
your
time
,
when
you
will
have
no
visit
to
receive
or
pay
?
 
<EOS>
no
party
of
pleasure
to
join
in
?
 
<EOS>
no
card
-
table
to
employ
your
winter
evening
;
and
even
,
as
the
taste
be
,
half
the
day
,
summer
and
winter
?
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
often
play
with
my
mother
,
too
,
and
so
know
how
to
perform
a
part
there
,
as
well
as
in
the
other
diversion
:
and
I
will
assure
you
,
my
girl
,
I
shall
not
desire
you
to
live
without
such
amusement
,
<EOS>
as
my
wife
may
expect
,
be
I
to
marry
a
lady
of
the
first
quality
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
be
all
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
how
shall
I
bear
it
?
 
<EOS>
but
do
you
think
,
sir
,
in
such
a
family
as
yours
,
a
person
whom
you
shall
honour
with
the
name
of
mistress
of
it
,
will
not
find
useful
employment
for
her
time
,
without
look
abroad
for
any
other
?
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
sir
,
if
you
will
give
me
leave
,
I
will
myself
look
into
such
part
of
the
family
economy
,
as
may
not
be
beneath
the
rank
to
which
I
shall
have
the
honour
of
be
exalt
,
if
any
such
there
can
be
;
and
this
,
I
hope
,
without
incur
the
ill
will
of
any
honest
servant
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
I
will
ease
you
of
as
much
of
your
family
account
,
as
I
possibly
can
,
when
I
have
convince
you
that
I
be
to
be
trust
with
them
;
and
you
know
,
sir
,
my
late
good
lady
make
me
her
treasurer
,
her
almoner
,
and
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
if
I
must
need
be
visit
or
visit
,
and
the
lady
will
not
honour
me
so
much
,
or
even
if
they
would
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
will
visit
,
if
your
goodness
will
allow
me
so
to
do
,
the
sick
poor
in
the
neighbourhood
around
you
;
and
administer
to
their
want
and
necessity
,
in
such
matter
as
may
not
be
hurtful
to
your
estate
,
but
comfortable
to
them
;
and
entail
upon
you
their
blessing
,
and
their
prayer
for
your
dear
health
and
welfare
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
will
assist
your
housekeeper
,
as
I
use
to
do
,
in
the
make
jelly
,
comfit
,
sweetmeat
,
marmalade
,
cordial
;
and
to
pot
,
and
candy
,
and
preserve
for
the
use
of
the
family
;
and
to
make
,
myself
,
all
the
fine
linen
of
it
for
yourself
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
if
you
will
sometimes
indulge
me
with
your
company
,
I
will
take
an
airing
in
your
chariot
now
and
then
:
and
when
you
shall
return
home
from
your
diversion
on
the
green
,
or
from
the
chase
,
or
where
you
shall
please
to
go
,
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
receive
you
with
duty
,
and
a
cheerful
delight
;
and
,
in
your
absence
,
count
the
moment
till
you
return
;
and
you
will
,
may
be
,
fill
up
some
part
of
my
time
,
the
sweetest
by
far
!
<EOS>
with
your
agreeable
conversation
,
for
an
hour
or
two
now
and
then
;
and
be
indulgent
to
the
impertinent
overflowing
of
my
grateful
heart
,
for
all
your
goodness
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
breakfasting
-
time
,
the
preparation
for
dinner
,
and
sometimes
to
entertain
your
choose
friend
,
and
the
company
you
shall
bring
home
with
you
,
gentleman
,
if
not
lady
,
and
the
suppering
,
will
fill
up
a
great
part
of
the
day
in
a
very
necessary
manner
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
may
be
,
sir
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
good
-
humoured
lady
will
drop
in
;
and
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
if
they
do
,
I
shall
so
behave
myself
,
as
not
to
add
to
the
disgrace
you
will
have
bring
upon
yourself
:
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
I
will
be
very
circumspect
,
and
try
to
be
as
discreet
as
I
can
;
and
<EOS>
as
humble
too
,
as
shall
be
consistent
with
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Cards
,
'
tis
true
,
I
can
play
at
,
in
all
the
usual
game
that
our
sex
delight
in
;
but
this
<EOS>
I
be
not
fond
of
,
nor
shall
ever
desire
to
play
,
unless
to
induce
such
lady
,
as
you
may
wish
to
see
,
not
to
abandon
your
house
for
want
of
an
amusement
they
be
accustomed
to
.
  
<EOS>
music
,
which
our
good
lady
teach
me
,
will
fill
up
some
interval
,
if
I
should
have
any
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
sir
,
you
know
,
I
love
read
and
scribbling
;
and
though
all
the
latter
will
be
employ
in
the
family
account
,
between
the
servant
and
me
,
and
me
and
your
good
self
:
yet
read
,
at
proper
time
,
<EOS>
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
,
which
I
shall
be
unwilling
to
give
up
,
for
the
good
company
in
the
world
,
except
yours
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
o
sir
!
<EOS>
that
will
help
to
polish
my
mind
,
and
make
me
worthy
of
your
company
and
conversation
;
and
,
with
the
explanation
you
will
give
me
,
of
what
I
shall
not
understand
,
will
be
a
sweet
employment
,
and
improvement
too
.
  
<EOS>
but
one
thing
,
sir
,
I
ought
not
to
forget
,
because
it
be
the
chief
:
<EOS>
My
duty
to
God
will
,
I
hope
,
always
employ
some
good
portion
of
my
time
,
with
thank
for
his
superlative
goodness
to
me
;
and
to
pray
for
you
and
myself
:
for
you
,
sir
,
for
a
blessing
on
you
,
for
your
great
goodness
to
such
an
unworthy
creature
:
for
myself
,
that
I
may
be
enable
to
discharge
my
duty
to
you
,
and
be
find
grateful
for
all
the
blessing
I
shall
receive
at
the
hand
of
Providence
,
by
mean
of
your
generosity
and
condescension
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
this
,
sir
,
say
I
,
can
you
think
I
shall
be
at
a
loss
to
pass
my
time
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
know
,
that
every
slight
to
me
,
if
I
come
to
be
so
happy
,
will
be
,
in
some
measure
,
a
slight
to
you
,
I
will
beg
of
you
,
sir
,
not
to
let
me
go
very
fine
in
dress
;
but
appear
only
so
,
as
that
you
may
not
be
ashamed
of
it
after
the
honour
I
shall
have
of
be
call
by
your
worthy
name
:
for
well
I
know
,
sir
,
that
nothing
so
much
excite
the
envy
of
my
own
sex
,
as
see
a
person
above
them
in
appearance
,
and
in
dress
.
<EOS>
and
that
would
bring
down
upon
me
an
hundred
saucy
thing
,
and
low
-
bear
brat
,
and
I
can
not
tell
what
!
  
<EOS>
there
I
stop
;
for
I
have
prattle
a
great
deal
too
much
so
early
:
and
he
say
,
clasp
me
to
him
<EOS>
,
why
stop
my
dear
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
she
not
proceed
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
dwell
upon
your
word
all
the
day
long
;
and
you
shall
be
the
directress
of
your
own
pleasure
,
and
your
own
time
,
so
sweetly
do
you
choose
to
employ
it
:
and
thus
shall
I
find
some
of
my
own
bad
action
atone
for
by
your
exemplary
goodness
,
and
God
will
bless
me
for
your
sake
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
say
he
,
what
pleasure
you
give
me
in
this
sweet
foretaste
of
my
happiness
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
defy
the
saucy
,
busy
censurer
of
the
world
;
and
bid
them
know
your
excellence
,
and
my
happiness
,
before
they
,
with
unhallowed
lip
,
presume
to
judge
of
my
action
,
and
your
merit
!
 
<EOS>
and
let
me
tell
you
,
my
Pamela
,
that
I
can
add
my
hope
of
a
still
more
pleasing
amusement
,
and
what
your
bashful
modesty
would
not
permit
you
to
hint
;
and
which
I
will
no
otherwise
touch
upon
,
lest
it
should
seem
,
to
your
nicety
,
to
detract
from
the
present
purity
of
my
good
intention
,
than
to
say
,
I
hope
to
have
superadde
to
all
these
,
such
an
employment
,
as
will
give
me
a
view
of
perpetuate
my
happy
prospect
,
and
my
family
at
the
same
time
;
of
which
I
be
almost
the
only
male
.
  
<EOS>
I
blush
,
I
believe
;
yet
could
not
be
displease
at
the
decent
and
charming
manner
with
which
he
insinuate
this
distant
hope
:
<EOS>
and
oh
!
judge
for
me
,
how
my
heart
be
affect
with
all
these
thing
!
  
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
add
another
charming
reflection
,
which
shew
me
the
noble
sincerity
of
his
kind
profession
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
own
to
you
,
my
Pamela
,
say
he
,
that
I
love
you
with
a
purer
flame
than
ever
I
know
in
my
whole
life
;
a
flame
to
which
I
be
a
stranger
;
and
which
commence
for
you
in
the
garden
;
though
you
,
unkindly
,
by
your
unseasonable
doubt
,
nip
the
opening
bud
,
while
it
be
too
tender
to
bear
the
cold
blast
of
slight
or
negligence
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
know
more
sincere
joy
and
satisfaction
in
this
sweet
hour
's
conversation
with
you
,
than
all
the
guilty
tumult
of
my
former
passion
ever
do
,
or
(
have
even
my
attempt
succeed
)
ever
could
have
afford
me
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
I
,
expect
not
word
from
your
poor
servant
,
equal
to
these
most
generous
profession
.
 
<EOS>
both
the
mean
,
and
the
will
<EOS>
,
I
now
see
,
be
give
to
you
,
to
lay
me
under
an
everlasting
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
how
happy
shall
I
be
,
if
,
though
I
can
not
be
worthy
of
all
this
goodness
and
condescension
,
I
can
prove
myself
not
entirely
unworthy
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
only
answer
for
a
grateful
heart
;
and
if
ever
I
give
you
cause
,
wilfully
,
(
and
you
will
generously
allow
for
involuntary
imperfection
,
)
to
be
disgust
with
me
,
may
I
be
an
outcast
from
your
house
and
favour
,
and
as
much
repudiate
,
as
if
the
law
have
divorce
me
from
you
!
  
<EOS>
but
sir
,
continue
I
,
though
I
be
so
unseasonable
as
I
be
in
the
garden
<EOS>
,
you
would
,
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
,
have
you
then
hear
me
,
have
pardon
my
imprudence
,
and
own
I
have
some
cause
to
fear
,
and
to
wish
to
be
with
my
poor
father
and
mother
:
and
this
I
the
rather
say
,
that
you
should
not
think
me
capable
of
return
insolence
for
your
goodness
;
or
appear
foolishly
ungrateful
to
you
,
when
you
be
so
kind
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
you
give
me
great
uneasiness
;
for
I
love
you
too
well
not
to
be
jealous
of
the
least
appearance
of
your
indifference
to
me
,
or
preference
to
any
other
person
,
not
except
your
parent
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
me
resolve
not
to
hear
you
;
for
I
have
not
get
over
my
reluctance
to
marriage
;
and
a
little
weight
<EOS>
,
you
know
,
turn
the
scale
,
when
it
hang
in
an
equal
balance
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
you
see
,
that
though
I
could
part
with
you
,
while
my
anger
hold
,
yet
the
regard
I
have
then
newly
profess
for
your
virtue
,
make
me
resolve
not
to
offer
to
violate
it
;
and
you
have
see
likewise
,
that
the
painful
struggle
I
undergo
when
I
begin
to
reflect
,
and
to
read
your
move
journal
,
between
my
desire
to
recall
you
,
and
my
doubt
whether
you
would
return
,
(
though
yet
I
resolve
not
to
force
you
to
it
,
)
have
like
to
have
cost
me
a
severe
illness
:
but
your
kind
and
cheerful
return
have
dispel
all
my
fear
,
and
give
me
hope
,
that
I
be
not
indifferent
to
you
;
and
you
see
how
your
presence
have
chase
away
my
illness
.
  
<EOS>
I
bless
God
for
it
,
say
I
;
but
since
you
be
so
good
as
to
encourage
me
,
and
will
not
despise
my
weakness
,
I
will
acknowledge
,
that
I
suffer
more
than
I
could
have
imagine
,
till
I
experience
it
,
in
be
banish
your
presence
in
so
much
anger
;
and
the
more
still
be
I
affect
,
when
you
answer
the
wicked
Mrs.
Jewkes
so
generously
in
my
favour
,
at
my
leave
your
house
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
,
sir
,
awaken
all
my
reverence
for
you
;
and
you
see
I
could
not
forbear
,
not
know
what
I
do
,
to
break
boldly
in
upon
you
,
and
acknowledge
your
goodness
on
my
knee
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
he
,
we
have
sufficiently
torture
one
another
;
and
the
only
comfort
that
can
result
from
it
,
will
be
,
reflect
upon
the
matter
coolly
and
with
pleasure
,
when
all
these
storm
be
overblown
,
(
as
I
hope
they
now
be
,
)
and
we
sit
together
secure
in
each
other
's
good
opinion
,
recount
the
uncommon
gradation
by
which
we
have
ascend
to
the
summit
of
that
felicity
,
which
I
hope
we
shall
shortly
arrive
at
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
,
say
the
good
gentleman
,
let
me
hear
what
my
dear
girl
would
have
say
in
her
justification
,
could
I
have
trust
myself
with
her
,
as
to
her
fear
,
and
the
reason
of
her
wish
herself
from
me
,
at
a
time
that
I
have
begin
to
shew
my
fondness
for
her
,
in
a
manner
that
I
think
would
have
be
agreeable
to
her
and
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
I
pull
out
of
my
pocket
the
gipsy
letter
;
but
I
say
,
before
I
shew
it
to
him
,
I
have
this
letter
,
sir
,
<EOS>
to
shew
you
,
as
what
,
I
believe
,
you
will
allow
must
have
give
me
the
great
disturbance
:
<EOS>
but
,
first
,
as
I
know
not
who
be
the
writer
,
and
it
seem
to
be
in
a
disguised
hand
,
I
would
beg
it
as
a
favour
,
that
,
if
you
guess
who
it
be
,
which
I
can
not
,
it
may
not
turn
to
their
prejudice
,
because
it
be
write
,
very
probably
,
with
no
other
view
,
than
to
serve
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
it
,
and
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
sign
Somebody
,
he
say
,
yes
,
this
be
indeed
from
somebody
;
and
,
disguise
as
the
hand
be
,
I
know
the
writer
:
do
not
you
see
,
by
the
setness
of
some
of
these
letter
,
and
a
little
secretary
cut
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
especially
in
that
c
,
and
that
r
,
that
it
be
the
hand
of
a
person
breed
in
the
law
-
way
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
'
tis
old
Longman
's
hand
:
an
officious
rascal
as
he
be
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
it
would
be
too
insolent
in
me
to
offer
<EOS>
(
so
much
be
I
myself
overwhelmed
with
your
goodness
,
)
to
defend
any
body
that
you
be
angry
with
:
<EOS>
yet
,
sir
,
so
far
as
they
have
incur
your
displeasure
for
my
sake
,
and
for
no
other
want
of
duty
or
respect
,
I
could
wish
 
<EOS>
but
I
dare
not
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
as
to
the
letter
and
the
information
it
contain
:
<EOS>
let
me
know
,
Pamela
,
when
you
receive
this
?
 
<EOS>
on
the
Friday
,
sir
,
say
I
,
that
you
be
go
to
the
wedding
at
Stamford
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
convey
to
you
,
say
he
,
unknown
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
when
I
give
her
such
a
strict
charge
to
attend
you
,
and
you
have
promise
me
,
that
you
would
not
throw
yourself
in
the
way
of
such
intelligence
?
 
<EOS>
for
,
say
he
,
when
I
go
to
Stamford
,
I
know
,
from
a
private
intimation
give
me
,
that
there
would
be
an
attempt
make
to
see
you
,
or
give
you
a
letter
,
by
somebody
,
if
not
to
get
you
away
;
but
be
not
certain
from
what
quarter
,
whether
from
my
sister
Davers
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
Mr.
Longman
,
or
John
Arnold
,
or
your
father
;
and
as
I
be
then
but
struggle
with
myself
,
whether
to
give
way
to
my
honourable
inclination
,
or
to
free
you
,
and
let
you
go
to
your
father
,
that
I
may
avoid
the
danger
I
find
myself
in
of
the
former
;
(
for
I
have
absolutely
resolve
never
to
wound
again
even
your
ear
with
any
proposal
of
a
contrary
nature
;
)
that
be
the
reason
I
desire
you
to
permit
Mrs.
jewke
to
be
so
much
on
her
guard
till
I
come
back
,
when
I
think
I
should
have
decide
this
dispute
point
within
myself
,
between
my
pride
and
my
inclination
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
good
sir
,
say
I
,
account
well
to
me
for
your
conduct
in
that
case
,
and
for
what
you
say
to
me
and
Mrs.
jewke
on
that
occasion
:
<EOS>
and
I
see
more
and
more
how
much
I
may
depend
upon
your
honour
and
goodness
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
all
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
recount
to
him
the
whole
affair
of
the
gipsy
,
and
how
the
letter
be
put
among
the
loose
grass
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
the
man
who
think
a
thousand
dragon
sufficient
to
watch
a
woman
,
when
her
inclination
take
a
contrary
bent
,
will
find
all
too
little
;
and
she
will
engage
the
stone
in
the
street
,
or
the
grass
in
the
field
,
to
act
for
her
,
and
help
on
her
correspondence
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
mind
,
say
he
,
be
not
engage
<EOS>
,
I
see
there
be
hardly
any
confinement
sufficient
for
the
body
;
and
you
have
tell
me
a
very
pretty
story
;
and
,
as
you
never
give
me
any
reason
to
question
your
veracity
,
even
in
your
severest
trial
,
I
make
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
what
you
have
now
mention
:
and
I
will
,
in
my
turn
,
give
you
such
a
proof
of
mine
,
that
you
shall
find
it
carry
a
conviction
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
then
,
my
Pamela
,
that
I
have
actually
form
such
a
project
,
so
well
informed
be
this
old
rascally
Somebody
!
<EOS>
and
the
time
be
fix
for
the
very
person
describe
in
this
letter
to
be
here
;
and
I
have
think
he
should
have
read
some
part
of
the
ceremony
(
as
little
as
be
possible
,
to
deceive
you
)
in
my
chamber
;
and
so
I
hope
to
have
you
mine
upon
term
that
then
would
have
be
much
more
agreeable
to
me
than
real
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
in
haste
intend
you
the
mortification
of
be
undeceived
;
so
that
we
may
have
live
for
year
,
perhaps
,
very
lovingly
together
;
and
I
have
,
at
the
same
time
,
be
at
liberty
to
confirm
or
abrogate
it
as
I
please
.
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
I
be
out
of
breath
with
the
thought
of
my
danger
!
 
<EOS>
but
what
good
angel
prevent
the
execution
of
this
deep
-
lay
design
?
  
<EOS>
why
,
your
good
angel
,
Pamela
,
say
he
;
for
when
I
begin
to
consider
,
that
it
would
have
make
you
miserable
,
and
me
not
happy
;
that
if
you
should
have
a
dear
little
one
,
it
would
be
out
of
my
own
power
to
legitimate
it
,
if
I
should
wish
it
to
inherit
my
estate
;
and
that
,
as
I
be
almost
the
last
of
my
family
,
and
most
of
what
I
possess
must
descend
to
a
strange
line
,
and
disagreeable
and
unworthy
person
;
notwithstanding
that
I
may
,
in
this
case
,
have
issue
of
my
own
body
;
when
I
further
consider
your
untainted
virtue
,
what
danger
and
trial
you
have
undergo
by
my
mean
,
and
what
a
world
of
trouble
I
have
involve
you
in
,
only
because
you
be
beautiful
and
virtuous
,
which
have
excite
all
my
passion
for
you
;
and
reflect
also
upon
your
try
prudence
and
truth
!
 
<EOS>
I
,
though
I
doubt
not
effect
this
my
last
plot
,
resolve
to
overcome
myself
;
and
,
however
I
may
suffer
in
struggle
with
my
affection
for
you
,
to
part
with
you
,
rather
than
to
betray
you
under
so
black
a
veil
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
I
remember
how
much
I
have
exclaim
against
and
censure
an
action
of
this
kind
,
that
have
be
attribute
to
one
of
the
first
man
of
the
law
,
and
of
the
kingdom
,
as
he
afterwards
become
;
and
that
it
be
but
tread
in
a
path
that
another
have
mark
out
for
me
;
and
,
as
I
be
assure
,
with
no
great
satisfaction
to
himself
,
when
he
come
to
reflect
;
my
foolish
pride
be
a
little
piqued
with
this
,
because
I
love
to
be
,
if
I
go
out
of
the
way
,
my
own
original
,
as
I
may
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
all
these
consideration
it
be
,
that
I
reject
this
project
,
and
send
word
to
the
person
,
that
I
have
better
consider
of
the
matter
,
and
would
not
have
him
come
,
till
he
hear
further
from
me
:
<EOS>
and
,
in
this
suspense
I
suppose
,
<EOS>
some
of
your
confederate
,
Pamela
,
(
for
we
have
be
a
couple
of
plotter
,
though
your
virtue
and
merit
have
procure
you
faithful
friend
and
partisan
,
which
my
money
and
promise
could
hardly
do
,
)
<EOS>
one
way
or
other
get
knowledge
of
it
,
and
give
you
this
notice
;
but
,
perhaps
,
it
would
have
come
too
late
,
have
not
your
white
angel
get
the
well
of
my
black
one
,
and
inspire
me
with
resolution
to
abandon
the
project
,
just
as
it
be
to
have
be
put
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
I
own
,
that
,
from
these
appearance
,
you
be
but
too
well
justified
in
your
fear
,
on
this
odd
way
of
come
at
this
intelligence
;
and
I
have
only
one
thing
to
blame
you
for
,
that
though
I
be
resolve
not
to
hear
you
in
your
own
defence
,
yet
,
as
you
have
so
ready
a
talent
at
your
pen
,
you
may
have
clear
your
part
of
this
matter
up
to
me
by
a
line
or
two
;
and
when
I
have
know
what
seem
good
ground
you
have
for
pour
cold
water
on
a
young
flame
,
that
be
just
then
rise
to
an
honourable
expansion
,
should
not
have
impute
it
,
as
I
be
apt
to
do
,
to
unseasonable
insult
for
my
tenderness
to
you
,
on
one
hand
;
to
perverse
nicety
,
on
the
other
;
or
to
(
what
I
be
most
alarm
by
,
and
concern
for
)
prepossession
for
some
other
person
:
and
this
would
have
save
us
both
much
fatigue
,
I
of
mind
,
you
of
body
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
of
mind
too
;
and
I
could
not
better
manifest
this
,
than
by
the
cheerfulness
with
which
I
obey
your
recall
me
to
your
presence
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
that
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
he
,
and
clasp
me
in
his
arm
,
be
the
kind
,
the
inexpressibly
kind
action
,
that
have
rivette
my
affection
to
you
,
and
oblige
me
,
in
this
free
and
unreserved
manner
,
to
pour
my
whole
soul
into
your
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
have
the
less
merit
in
this
my
return
,
because
I
be
drive
,
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
it
;
and
could
not
help
it
,
if
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
say
he
,
(
and
honour
me
by
kiss
my
hand
,
)
be
engage
,
indeed
;
if
I
may
hope
,
that
my
Pamela
's
gentle
inclination
for
her
persecutor
be
the
strong
motive
to
her
return
;
and
I
so
much
value
a
voluntary
love
in
the
person
I
would
wish
for
my
wife
,
that
I
would
have
even
prudence
and
interest
hardly
name
in
comparison
with
it
:
and
can
you
return
me
sincerely
the
honest
compliment
I
now
make
you
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
choice
I
have
make
,
it
be
impossible
I
should
have
any
view
to
my
interest
.
 
<EOS>
love
,
true
love
,
be
the
only
motive
by
which
I
be
induce
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
I
not
what
I
be
,
could
you
give
me
the
preference
to
any
other
you
know
in
the
world
,
notwithstanding
what
have
pass
between
us
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
,
should
your
so
much
oblige
Pamela
refuse
to
answer
this
kind
question
?
 
<EOS>
Cruel
as
I
have
think
you
,
and
dangerous
as
your
view
to
my
honesty
have
be
;
you
,
sir
,
be
the
only
person
live
that
ever
be
more
than
indifferent
to
me
:
and
before
I
know
this
to
be
what
I
blush
now
to
call
it
,
I
could
not
hate
you
,
or
wish
you
ill
,
though
,
from
my
soul
,
the
attempt
you
make
be
shocking
,
and
most
distasteful
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
satisfied
,
my
Pamela
,
say
he
;
nor
shall
I
want
to
see
those
paper
that
you
have
kindly
write
for
to
your
father
;
though
I
still
wish
to
see
them
too
,
for
the
sake
of
the
sweet
manner
in
which
you
relate
what
have
pass
,
and
to
have
before
me
the
whole
series
of
your
suffering
,
that
I
may
learn
what
degree
of
kindness
may
be
sufficient
to
recompense
you
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
do
your
happy
daughter
find
herself
bless
by
her
generous
master
!
 
<EOS>
an
ample
recompense
for
all
her
suffering
<EOS>
do
I
think
this
sweet
conversation
only
.
 
<EOS>
a
hundred
tender
thing
he
express
besides
,
that
though
they
never
can
escape
my
memory
,
yet
would
be
too
tedious
to
write
down
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
I
bless
God
,
and
,
I
hope
,
ever
shall
,
for
all
his
gracious
favour
to
his
unworthy
handmaid
!
<EOS>
what
a
happy
change
be
this
!
 
<EOS>
and
who
know
<EOS>
but
my
kind
,
my
generous
master
,
may
put
it
in
my
power
,
when
he
shall
see
me
not
quite
unworthy
of
it
,
to
be
a
means
,
without
injure
him
,
to
dispense
around
me
,
to
many
person
,
the
happy
influence
of
the
condition
to
which
I
shall
be
,
by
his
kind
favour
,
exalt
?
 
<EOS>
doubly
blest
shall
I
be
,
in
particular
,
if
I
can
return
the
hundredth
part
of
the
obligation
I
owe
to
such
honest
good
parent
,
to
whose
pious
instruction
and
example
,
under
God
,
I
owe
all
my
present
happiness
,
and
future
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
o
the
joy
that
fill
my
mind
on
these
proud
hope
!
<EOS>
on
these
delightful
prospect
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
mighty
for
me
,
and
I
must
sit
down
to
ponder
all
these
thing
,
and
to
admire
and
bless
the
goodness
of
that
Providence
,
which
have
,
through
so
many
intricate
maze
,
make
me
tread
the
path
of
innocence
,
and
so
amply
reward
me
for
what
it
have
itself
<EOS>
enable
me
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
all
glory
to
God
alone
be
ever
give
for
it
,
by
your
poor
enraptured
daughter
!
<EOS>
#

<EOS>
I
will
now
continue
my
most
pleasing
relation
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
chariot
be
return
home
from
this
sweet
airing
,
he
say
,
from
all
that
have
pass
between
us
in
this
pleasing
turn
,
my
Pamela
will
see
,
and
will
believe
,
that
the
trial
of
her
virtue
be
all
over
from
me
:
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
,
there
will
be
some
few
yet
to
come
of
her
patience
and
humility
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
,
at
the
earnest
importunity
of
Lady
Darnford
,
and
her
daughter
,
promise
them
a
sight
of
my
beloved
girl
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
intend
to
have
their
whole
family
,
and
Lady
Jones
,
and
Mrs.
Peters
's
family
,
to
dine
with
me
once
in
a
few
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
since
I
believe
you
would
hardly
choose
,
at
present
,
to
grace
the
table
on
the
occasion
,
till
you
can
do
it
in
your
own
right
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
glad
you
would
not
refuse
come
down
to
us
if
I
should
desire
it
;
for
I
would
preface
our
nuptial
,
say
the
dear
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
o
what
a
sweet
word
be
that
!
 
<EOS>
with
their
good
opinion
of
your
merit
:
and
to
see
you
,
and
your
sweet
manner
,
will
be
enough
for
that
purpose
;
and
so
,
by
degree
,
prepare
my
neighbour
for
what
be
to
follow
:
and
they
already
have
your
character
from
me
,
and
be
dispose
to
admire
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
after
all
that
have
pass
,
I
should
be
unworthy
,
if
I
could
not
say
,
that
I
can
have
no
will
but
yours
:
<EOS>
and
however
awkwardly
I
shall
behave
in
such
company
,
weigh
down
with
a
sense
of
your
obligation
on
one
side
,
and
my
own
unworthiness
,
<EOS>
with
their
observation
on
the
other
,
I
will
not
scruple
to
obey
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
you
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
and
pray
be
only
dress
as
you
be
;
for
since
they
know
your
condition
,
and
I
have
tell
them
the
story
of
your
present
dress
,
and
how
you
come
by
it
,
<EOS>
one
of
the
young
lady
beg
it
as
a
favour
,
that
they
may
see
you
just
as
you
be
:
and
I
be
the
rather
pleased
it
should
be
so
,
because
they
will
perceive
you
owe
nothing
to
dress
,
but
make
a
much
well
figure
with
your
own
native
stock
of
loveliness
,
than
the
great
lady
array
in
the
most
splendid
attire
,
and
adorn
with
the
most
glittering
jewel
.
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
your
goodness
behold
your
poor
servant
in
a
light
greatly
beyond
her
merit
!
 
<EOS>
but
it
must
not
be
expect
,
that
other
,
lady
especially
,
will
look
upon
me
with
your
favourable
eye
:
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
I
should
be
best
pleased
to
wear
always
this
humble
garb
,
till
you
,
for
your
own
sake
,
shall
order
it
otherwise
:
for
,
oh
,
sir
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
I
hope
it
will
be
always
my
pride
to
glory
most
in
your
goodness
!
<EOS>
and
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
shew
every
one
,
that
,
with
respect
to
my
happiness
in
this
life
,
I
be
entirely
the
work
of
your
bounty
;
and
to
let
the
world
see
from
what
a
lowly
original
you
have
raise
me
to
honour
,
that
the
great
lady
would
rejoice
in
.
  
<EOS>
admirable
Pamela
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
excellent
girl
!
 
<EOS>
surely
thy
sentiment
be
superior
to
those
of
all
thy
sex
!
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
address
a
hundred
fine
lady
;
but
never
,
surely
,
could
have
have
reason
to
admire
one
as
I
do
you
.
  
<EOS>
as
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
repeat
these
generous
saying
,
only
because
they
be
the
effect
of
my
master
's
goodness
,
be
far
from
presume
to
think
I
deserve
one
of
them
;
so
I
hope
you
will
not
attribute
it
to
my
vanity
;
for
I
do
assure
you
,
I
think
I
ought
rather
to
be
more
humble
,
as
I
be
more
obliged
:
for
it
must
be
always
a
sign
of
a
poor
condition
,
to
receive
obligation
<EOS>
one
can
not
repay
;
as
it
be
of
a
rich
mind
,
when
it
can
confer
them
without
expect
or
need
a
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
on
one
side
,
the
state
of
the
human
creature
,
compare
,
on
the
other
,
to
the
Creator
;
and
so
,
with
due
deference
,
may
his
beneficence
be
say
to
be
Godlike
,
and
that
be
the
high
that
can
be
say
.
  
<EOS>
the
chariot
bring
us
home
at
near
the
hour
of
two
;
and
,
bless
be
God
,
my
master
be
pure
well
,
and
cheerful
;
and
that
make
me
hope
he
do
not
repent
him
of
his
late
generous
treatment
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
hand
me
out
of
the
chariot
,
and
to
the
parlour
,
with
the
same
goodness
,
that
he
shew
when
he
put
me
into
it
,
before
several
of
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
to
inquire
how
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
quite
well
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
he
;
quite
well
<EOS>
:
I
thank
God
,
and
this
good
girl
,
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
,
say
she
;
but
I
hope
you
be
not
the
bad
for
my
care
,
and
my
doctoring
of
you
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
<EOS>
but
the
well
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
he
;
you
have
much
oblige
me
by
both
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
you
and
I
have
use
this
good
girl
very
hardly
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
,
sir
,
say
she
,
I
should
be
the
subject
of
her
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
say
he
,
she
have
not
open
her
lip
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
a
quite
different
subject
to
talk
of
;
and
I
hope
she
will
forgive
us
both
:
<EOS>
You
especially
she
must
;
because
you
have
do
nothing
but
by
my
order
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
only
mean
,
that
the
necessary
consequence
of
those
order
have
be
very
grievous
to
my
Pamela
:
and
now
come
our
part
to
make
her
amend
,
if
we
can
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
she
,
I
always
say
to
madam
(
as
she
call
me
)
,
that
you
be
very
good
,
and
very
forgiving
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
he
,
I
have
be
stark
naught
;
and
it
be
she
,
<EOS>
I
hope
,
will
be
very
forgiving
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
this
preamble
be
to
tell
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
now
I
desire
you
will
study
to
oblige
her
,
as
much
as
(
to
obey
me
)
<EOS>
you
be
force
to
disoblige
her
before
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
remember
,
that
in
every
thing
she
be
to
be
her
own
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
say
she
,
and
mine
too
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
the
generous
gentleman
,
I
believe
it
will
be
so
in
a
little
time
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
I
know
how
it
will
go
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Pamela
,
say
my
master
,
comfort
poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
generous
,
already
to
seem
to
put
her
in
my
power
:
and
I
take
her
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
I
shall
never
take
upon
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
make
a
bad
use
of
any
opportunity
that
may
be
put
into
my
hand
by
my
generous
master
;
nor
shall
I
ever
wish
to
do
you
any
disservice
,
if
I
may
:
for
I
shall
consider
,
that
what
you
have
do
,
be
in
obedience
to
a
will
which
it
will
become
me
also
to
submit
to
<EOS>
and
so
,
if
the
effect
of
our
obedience
may
be
different
,
yet
as
they
proceed
from
one
cause
,
that
must
be
always
reverence
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
see
there
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
my
master
,
we
be
both
in
generous
hand
;
and
indeed
,
if
Pamela
do
not
pardon
you
,
I
should
think
she
but
half
forgave
me
,
because
you
act
by
my
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
God
bless
you
both
together
,
since
it
must
be
so
;
and
I
will
double
my
diligence
to
oblige
my
lady
,
as
I
find
she
will
soon
be
.
  
<EOS>
o
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
<EOS>
now
pray
for
me
on
another
score
;
for
fear
I
should
grow
too
proud
,
and
be
giddy
and
foolish
with
all
these
promising
thing
,
so
soothing
to
the
vanity
of
my
year
and
sex
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
to
this
hour
can
I
pray
,
that
God
would
remove
from
me
all
these
delightful
prospect
,
if
they
be
likely
so
to
corrupt
my
mind
,
as
to
make
me
proud
and
vain
,
and
not
acknowledge
,
with
thankful
humility
,
the
bless
Providence
which
have
so
visibly
conduct
me
through
the
dangerous
path
I
have
trod
,
to
this
happy
moment
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
be
pleased
to
say
,
that
he
think
I
may
as
well
dine
with
him
,
since
he
be
alone
:
<EOS>
but
I
beg
he
would
excuse
me
,
for
fear
,
as
I
say
,
such
excess
of
goodness
and
condescension
,
all
at
once
,
should
turn
my
head
;
 
and
that
he
would
,
by
slow
degree
,
bring
on
my
happiness
,
lest
I
should
not
know
how
to
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
person
that
doubt
themselves
,
say
he
,
seldom
do
amiss
:
<EOS>
and
if
there
be
any
fear
of
what
you
say
,
you
could
not
have
it
in
your
thought
:
for
none
but
the
presumptuous
,
the
conceited
,
and
the
thoughtless
,
err
capitally
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
say
he
,
I
have
such
an
opinion
of
your
prudence
,
that
I
shall
generally
think
what
you
do
right
,
because
it
be
you
that
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
your
kind
expression
shall
not
be
throw
away
upon
me
,
if
I
can
help
it
;
for
they
will
task
me
with
the
care
of
endeavour
to
deserve
your
good
opinion
,
and
your
approbation
,
as
the
good
rule
of
my
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
be
then
about
to
go
up
stair
,
permit
me
,
sir
,
say
I
,
(
look
about
me
with
some
confusion
,
to
see
that
nobody
be
there
,
)
thus
on
my
knee
to
thank
you
,
as
I
often
want
to
do
in
the
chariot
,
for
all
your
goodness
to
me
,
which
shall
never
,
I
hope
,
be
cast
away
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
the
boldness
to
kiss
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
since
,
how
I
come
to
be
so
forward
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
My
poor
grateful
heart
be
like
a
too
full
river
,
which
overflow
its
bank
:
and
it
carry
away
my
fear
and
my
shamefacedness
,
as
that
do
all
before
it
on
the
surface
of
its
water
!
  
<EOS>
He
clasp
me
in
his
arm
with
transport
,
and
condescendingly
kneel
by
me
,
and
kiss
me
,
say
,
o
my
dear
oblige
good
girl
,
on
my
knee
,
as
you
on
yours
,
I
vow
to
you
everlasting
truth
and
fidelity
!
<EOS>
and
may
God
but
bless
us
<EOS>
both
with
half
the
pleasure
that
seem
to
be
before
us
,
and
we
shall
have
no
reason
to
envy
the
felicity
of
the
great
prince
!
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
how
shall
I
support
so
much
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
poor
,
indeed
,
in
every
thing
,
compare
to
you
!
<EOS>
and
how
far
,
very
far
,
do
you
,
in
every
generous
way
,
leave
me
behind
you
!
  
<EOS>
He
raise
me
,
and
,
as
I
bend
towards
the
door
,
lead
me
to
the
stairs
foot
,
and
,
salute
me
there
again
,
leave
me
to
go
up
to
my
closet
,
where
I
throw
myself
on
my
knee
in
rapture
of
joy
,
and
bless
that
gracious
God
,
who
have
thus
change
my
distress
to
happiness
,
and
so
abundantly
reward
me
for
all
the
suffering
I
have
pass
through
.
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
,
how
light
,
how
very
light
,
do
all
those
suffering
now
appear
,
which
then
my
repining
mind
make
so
grievous
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
hence
,
in
every
state
of
life
,
and
in
all
the
change
and
chance
of
it
,
for
the
future
,
will
I
trust
in
Providence
,
who
know
what
be
good
for
us
,
and
frequently
turn
the
very
evil
we
most
dread
,
to
be
the
cause
of
our
happiness
,
and
of
our
deliverance
from
great
.
 
<EOS>
My
experience
,
young
as
I
be
,
as
to
this
great
point
of
reliance
on
God
,
be
strong
,
though
my
judgment
in
general
may
be
weak
and
uninformed
:
but
you
will
excuse
these
reflection
,
because
they
be
your
beloved
daughter
's
;
and
,
so
far
as
they
be
not
amiss
,
derive
themselves
from
the
benefit
of
yours
and
my
late
good
lady
's
example
and
instruction
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
write
a
vast
deal
in
a
little
time
;
and
shall
only
say
,
to
conclude
this
delightful
Wednesday
,
that
in
the
afternoon
my
good
master
be
so
well
,
that
he
ride
out
on
horseback
,
and
come
home
about
nine
at
night
;
and
then
step
up
to
me
,
and
,
see
me
with
pen
and
ink
before
me
in
my
closet
,
say
,
I
come
only
to
tell
you
I
be
very
well
,
my
Pamela
:
<EOS>
and
since
I
have
a
letter
or
two
to
write
,
I
will
leave
you
to
proceed
in
yours
,
as
I
suppose
that
be
your
employment
,
(
for
I
have
put
by
my
paper
at
his
come
up
,
)
and
so
he
salute
me
,
bid
me
good
night
,
and
go
down
;
and
<EOS>
I
finish
up
to
this
place
before
I
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
tell
me
,
if
it
be
more
agreeable
to
me
,
she
would
he
in
another
room
;
but
I
say
,
no
thank
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
pray
let
me
have
your
company
.
<EOS>
and
she
make
me
a
fine
courtesy
,
and
thank
me
.
 
<EOS>
how
time
be
alter
!
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
this
morning
my
master
come
up
to
me
,
and
talk
with
me
on
various
subject
,
for
a
good
while
together
,
in
the
most
kind
manner
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
thing
,
he
ask
me
,
if
I
choose
to
order
any
new
clothe
against
my
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
(
o
how
my
heart
flutter
when
he
mention
this
subject
so
freely
!
)
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
leave
every
thing
to
his
good
pleasure
,
only
repeat
my
request
,
for
the
reason
aforegiven
,
that
I
may
not
be
too
fine
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
think
,
my
dear
,
it
shall
be
very
private
:
I
hope
you
be
not
afraid
of
a
sham
-
marriage
;
and
pray
get
the
service
by
heart
,
that
you
may
see
nothing
be
omit
.
 
<EOS>
I
glow
between
shame
and
delight
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
feel
my
cheek
burn
!
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
fear
nothing
,
I
apprehend
nothing
,
but
my
own
unworthiness
.
<EOS>
say
he
,
<EOS>
I
think
it
shall
be
do
within
these
fourteen
day
,
from
this
day
,
at
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
tremble
!
<EOS>
but
not
with
grief
,
you
may
believe
 
what
say
my
girl
?
 
<EOS>
have
you
to
object
against
any
day
of
the
next
fourteen
:
because
my
affair
require
me
to
go
to
my
other
house
,
and
I
think
not
to
stir
from
this
till
I
be
happy
with
you
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
will
<EOS>
but
yours
,
say
I
(
all
glow
like
the
fire
,
as
I
could
feel
:
)
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
do
you
say
in
the
house
?
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
he
;
for
I
care
not
how
privately
it
be
do
;
and
it
must
be
very
public
if
we
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
holy
rite
,
sir
,
say
I
;
and
would
be
well
,
methink
,
in
a
holy
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
(
say
he
,
most
kindly
)
<EOS>
my
lovely
maid
's
confusion
;
and
your
tremble
tenderness
shew
<EOS>
I
ought
to
oblige
you
all
I
may
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
will
order
my
own
little
chapel
,
which
have
not
be
use
for
two
generation
,
for
any
thing
but
a
lumber
-
room
,
because
our
family
seldom
reside
here
long
together
,
to
be
clear
and
clean
,
and
get
ready
for
the
ceremony
,
if
you
dislike
your
own
chamber
or
mine
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
that
will
be
well
than
the
chamber
,
and
I
hope
it
will
never
be
lumber
again
,
but
keep
to
the
use
for
which
,
as
I
presume
,
it
have
be
consecrate
.
 
<EOS>
o
yes
,
say
he
,
it
have
be
consecrate
,
and
that
several
age
ago
,
in
my
great
great
grandfather
's
time
,
who
build
that
and
the
good
old
house
together
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
my
good
girl
,
if
I
do
not
too
much
add
to
your
sweet
confusion
<EOS>
,
shall
it
be
in
the
first
seven
day
,
or
the
second
of
this
fortnight
?
 
<EOS>
I
look
down
,
quite
out
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
,
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
second
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
as
you
please
,
say
he
most
kindly
;
<EOS>
but
I
should
thank
you
,
Pamela
,
if
you
would
choose
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
say
I
,
have
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
be
it
so
;
but
do
not
defer
it
till
the
last
day
of
the
fourteen
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
sir
,
say
I
,
since
you
embolden
me
to
talk
on
this
important
subject
,
may
I
not
send
my
dear
father
and
mother
word
of
my
happiness
?
  
<EOS>
You
may
,
say
he
;
but
charge
them
to
keep
it
secret
,
till
you
or
I
direct
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
tell
you
,
I
would
see
no
more
of
your
paper
;
but
I
mean
,
I
would
not
without
your
consent
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
will
shew
them
to
me
(
and
now
I
have
no
other
motive
for
my
curiosity
,
but
the
pleasure
I
take
in
read
what
you
write
,
)
<EOS>
I
shall
acknowledge
it
as
a
favour
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
will
be
pleased
to
let
me
write
over
again
one
sheet
<EOS>
,
I
will
;
though
I
have
rely
upon
your
word
,
and
not
write
them
for
your
perusal
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
say
he
:
though
I
can
not
consent
to
it
beforehand
:
for
I
more
desire
to
see
them
,
because
they
be
your
true
sentiment
at
the
time
,
and
because
they
be
not
write
for
my
perusal
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
what
I
be
loath
you
should
see
,
be
very
severe
reflection
on
the
letter
I
receive
by
the
gipsy
,
when
I
apprehend
your
design
of
the
sham
-
marriage
;
though
there
be
other
thing
I
would
not
have
you
see
;
but
that
be
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
bad
,
say
he
,
my
dear
sauce
-
box
,
than
I
have
see
already
;
and
I
will
allow
your
treat
me
in
ever
so
black
a
manner
,
on
that
occasion
,
because
it
must
have
a
very
black
appearance
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
will
obey
you
before
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
alter
a
word
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
,
sir
,
reply
I
,
since
you
order
it
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
talk
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
up
,
and
say
Thomas
be
return
.
<EOS>
o
,
say
my
master
,
let
him
bring
up
the
paper
:
for
he
hope
,
and
so
do
I
,
that
you
have
send
them
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
great
balk
,
when
he
come
up
and
say
,
Sir
,
Mr.
Andrews
do
not
care
to
deliver
them
;
and
would
have
it
,
that
his
daughter
be
force
to
write
that
letter
to
him
:
and
,
indeed
,
sir
,
say
he
,
the
old
gentleman
take
on
sadly
,
and
would
have
it
that
his
daughter
be
undo
,
or
else
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
she
would
not
have
turn
back
,
when
on
her
way
,
(
as
I
tell
him
she
do
,
say
Thomas
,
)
instead
of
come
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
afraid
now
that
all
would
be
bad
for
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Tom
,
say
he
,
do
not
mince
the
matter
;
tell
me
,
before
Mrs.
Andrews
,
what
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
both
he
and
Goody
Andrews
,
after
they
have
confer
together
upon
your
letter
,
madam
,
come
out
,
weep
bitterly
,
that
grieve
my
very
heart
;
and
they
say
,
now
all
be
over
with
their
poor
daughter
;
and
either
she
have
write
that
letter
by
compulsion
,
or
have
yield
to
your
honour
;
so
they
say
;
and
be
,
or
would
be
ruin
!
  
<EOS>
My
master
seem
vexed
,
as
I
fear
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
Pray
,
sir
,
be
so
good
as
to
excuse
the
fear
of
my
honest
parent
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
know
your
goodness
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
(
say
he
,
without
answer
me
,
)
<EOS>
they
refuse
to
deliver
the
paper
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
and
please
your
honour
,
say
Thomas
,
though
I
tell
them
,
that

as

when

could
not

for

<EOS>
and

down
,
and
,
hand
-
in

hand
,
lean
upon
each
other
's
shoulder
,
do
nothing
but
lament
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
piteously
grieve
,
say
he
;
but
all
I
could
say
could
not
comfort
them
;
nor
would
they
give
me
the
paper
;
though
I
tell
them
I
should
deliver
them
only
to
Mrs.
Andrews
herself
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
and
please
your
honour
,
I
be
force
to
come
away
without
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
see
me
all
bathe
in
tear
at
this
description
of
your
distress
and
fear
for
me
;
and
he
say
,
I
would
not
have
you
take
on
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
angry
with
your
father
in
the
main
;
he
be
a
good
man
;
and
I
would
have
you
write
out
of
hand
,
and
it
shall
be
send
by
the
post
to
Mr.
Atkins
,
who
live
within
two
mile
of
your
father
,
and
I
will
enclose
it
in
a
cover
of
mine
,
in
which
I
will
desire
Mr.
Atkins
,
the
moment
it
come
to
his
hand
,
to
convey
it
safely
to
your
father
or
mother
;
and
say
nothing
of
their
send
their
paper
,
that
it
may
not
make
them
uneasy
;
for
I
want
not
now
to
see
them
on
any
other
score
than
that
of
mere
curiosity
;
and
that
will
do
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
he
salute
me
before
Thomas
,
and
with
his
own
handkerchief
wipe
my
eye
;
and
say
to
Thomas
,
the
good
old
folk
be
not
to
be
blame
in
the
main
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
know
my
honourable
intention
by
their
dear
daughter
;
who
,
Tom
,
will
,
in
a
little
time
,
be
your
mistress
;
though
I
shall
keep
the
matter
private
some
day
,
and
would
not
have
it
speak
of
by
my
servant
out
of
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
say
,
God
bless
your
honour
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
best
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
o
,
sir
,
you
be
all
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
how
kind
be
this
,
to
forgive
the
disappointment
,
instead
of
be
angry
,
as
I
fear
you
would
!
 
<EOS>
Thomas
then
withdraw
.
<EOS>
and
my
master
say
,
I
need
not
remind
you
of
write
out
of
hand
,
to
make
the
good
folk
easy
:
and
I
will
leave
you
to
yourself
for
that
purpose
;
only

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
o

the
chief
reason
of
their

<EOS>
and
you
will
see
nobody

<EOS>
My
serious
reflection
on
this
letter
,
etc
.
"
<EOS>
(
all
which
,
I
hope
,
with
the
other
,
you
will
shortly
see
.
)
 
<EOS>
and
this
carry
matter
down
to
Tuesday
night
last
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
follow
be
so
kind
on
his
side
,
be
our
chariot
conference
,
as
above
,
on
Wednesday
morning
,
and
how
good
he
have
be
ever
since
,
that
I
think
I
would
go
no
further
;
for
I
be
a
little
ashamed
to
be
so
very
open
on
that
tender
and
most
grateful
subject
;
though
his
great
goodness
to
me
deserve
all
the
acknowledgment
I
can
possibly
make
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
look
these
out
,
I
carry
them
down
myself
into
the
parlour
to
him
;
and
say
,
put
them
into
his
hand
,
Your
allowance
,
good
sir
,
as
heretofore
;
and
if
I
have
be
too
open
and
free
in
my
reflection
or
declaration
,
let
my
fear
on
one
side
,
and
my
sincerity
on
the
other
,
be
my
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
very
obliging
,
my
good
girl
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
my
thought
,
any
more
than
from
my
action
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
up
,
and
write
the
letter
to
you
,
briefly
acquaint
you
with
my
present
happiness
,
and
my
master
's
goodness
,
and
express
the
gratitude
of
heart
,
which
I
owe
to
the
kind
gentleman
in
the
world
,
and
assure
you
,
that
I
should
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
send
back
to
you
,
not
only
those
paper
,
but
all
that
succeed
them
to
this
time
,
as
I
know
you
delight
to
amuse
yourself
in
your
leisure
hour
with
my
scribble
:
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
carry
it
down
to
my
master
,
before
I
seal
it
,
Will
you
please
,
sir
,
to
take
the
trouble
of
read
what
I
write
to
my
dear
parent
?
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
and
set
me
on
his
knee
,
while
he
read
it
;
and
seem
much
pleased
with
it
;
and
give
it
me
again
,
You
be
very
happy
,
say
he
,
my
beloved
girl
,
in
your
style
and
expression
:
and
the
affectionate
thing
you
say
of
me
be
inexpressibly
oblige
;
and
again
,
with
this
kiss
,
say
he
,
do
I
confirm
for
truth
all
that
you
have
promise
for
my
intention
in
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
o
what
halcyon
day
be
these
!
 
<EOS>
God
continue
them
!
 
<EOS>
a
change
would
kill
me
quite
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
out
in
his
chariot
in
the
afternoon
;
and
in
the
evening
return
,
and
send
me
word
<EOS>
,
he
would
be
glad
of
my
company
for
a
little
walk
in
the
garden
;
and
down
I
go
that
very
moment
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
say
he
,
how
do
my
dear
girl
do
now
?
 
<EOS>
whom
do
you
think
I
have
see
since
I
have
be
out
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
sir
,
say
I.
Why
,
say
he
,
there
be
a
turning
in
the
road
,
about
five
mile
off
,
<EOS>
that
go
round
a
meadow
,
that
have
a
pleasant
foot
-
way
,
by
the
side
of
a
little
brook
,
and
a
double
row
of
lime
on
each
side
,
where
now
and
then
the
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
walk
,
and
angle
,
and
divert
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
shew
it
you
next
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
stept
out
of
my
chariot
,
to
walk
across
this
meadow
,
and
bid
Robin
meet
me
with
it
on
the
further
part
of
it
:
<EOS>
and
whom
should
I
"
spy
there
,
walk
,
with
a
book
in
his
hand
,
reading
,
but
your
humble
servant
Mr.
Williams
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
blush
,
Pamela
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
as
his
back
be
towards
me
,
I
think
I
would
speak
to
the
man
:
<EOS>
and
,
before
he
see
me
,
I
say
,
how
do
you
,
old
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
(
for
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
you
know
we
be
of
one
college
for
a
twelvemonth
.
)
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
man
would
have
jump
into
the
brook
,
he
give
such
a
start
at
hear
my
voice
,
and
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
poor
man
!
<EOS>
say
I.
 
ay
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
but
not
too
much
of
your
poor
man
,
in
that
soft
accent
,
neither
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
be
sorry
my
voice
be
so
startling
to
you
,
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
you
read
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
he
,
and
stammer
with
the
surprise
,
it
be
the
french
Telemachus
;
for
I
be
about
perfect
myself
,
if
I
can
,
in
the
french
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
<EOS>
I
,
I
have
rather
so
,
than
perfect
my
Pamela
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
well
,
reply
I.
  
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
that
yonder
cloud
may
give
us
a
small
shower
?
<EOS>
and
it
do
a
little
begin
to
wet
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
believe
not
much
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
say
I
,
you
be
for
the
village
,
I
will
give
you
a
cast
;
for
I
shall
call
at
Sir
Simon
's
in
my
return
from
the
little
round
I
be
take
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
me
if
it
be
not
too
great
a
favour
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
I
,
do
not
talk
of
that
;
let
us
walk
to
the
further
opening
there
,
and
we
shall
meet
my
chariot
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
Pamela
,
continue
my
master
,
we
fall
into
conversation
as
we
walk
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
very
sorry
he
have
incur
my
displeasure
;
and
the
more
,
as
he
have
be
tell
,
by
Lady
Jones
,
who
have
it
from
Sir
Simon
's
family
,
that
I
have
a
more
honourable
view
than
at
first
be
apprehend
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
We
fellow
of
fortune
,
Mr.
Williams
,
take
sometimes
a
little
more
liberty
with
the
world
than
we
ought
to
do
;
<EOS>
wanton
,
very
probably
,
as
you
contemplative
folk
would
say
,
in
the
sunbeam
of
a
dangerous
affluence
;
and
can
not
think
of
confine
ourselves
to
the
common
path
,
though
the
safe
and
most
eligible
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
believe
I
could
not
very
well
like
to
be
supplant
in
a
view
that
lie
next
my
heart
;
and
that
by
an
old
acquaintance
,
whose
good
,
before
this
affair
,
I
be
studious
to
promote
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
only
say
,
sir
,
say
he
,
that
my
first
motive
be
entirely
such
as
become
my
function
:
<EOS>
and
,
very
politely
,
say
my
master
,
he
add
,
and
I
be
very
sure
,
that
however
inexcusable
I
may
seem
in
the
progress
of
the
matter
,
yourself
,
sir
,
would
have
be
sorry
to
have
it
say
,
you
have
cast
your
thought
on
a
person
,
that
nobody
could
have
wish
for
but
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Williams
,
say
I
,
I
see
you
be
a
man
of
gallantry
,
as
well
as
religion
<EOS>
:
but
what
I
take
most
amiss
be
,
that
,
if
you
think
me
do
a
wrong
thing
,
you
do
not
expostulate
with
me
upon
it
,
as
your
function
may
have
allow
you
to
do
;
but
immediately
determine
to
counterplot
me
,
and
attempt
to
secure
to
yourself
a
prize
you
would
have
rob
me
of
,
and
that
from
my
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
matter
be
at
an
end
,
and
I
retain
not
any
malice
upon
it
;
though
you
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
I
may
,
at
last
,
do
honourably
by
her
,
as
I
actually
intend
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
myself
,
sir
,
say
he
,
that
I
should
so
unhappily
incur
your
displeasure
;
but
I
rejoice
for
her
sake
in
your
honourable
intention
:
give
me
leave
only
to
say
,
that
if
you
make
Miss
Andrews
your
lady
,
she
will
do
credit
to
your
choice
with
every
body
that
see
her
,
or
come
to
know
her
;
and
,
for
person
and
mind
both
,
you
may
challenge
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
say
my
master
,
do
the
parson
and
I
confabulate
;
and
I
set
him
down
at
his
lodging
in
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
keep
your
secret
,
Pamela
;
and
would
not
own
,
that
you
give
any
encouragement
to
his
address
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
he
could
not
say
that
I
do
;
and
I
hope
you
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
I
do
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
but
'
tis
still
my
opinion
,
that
if
,
when
I
see
plot
set
up
against
my
plot
,
I
have
not
discover
the
parson
as
I
do
,
the
correspondence
between
you
may
have
go
to
a
length
that
would
have
put
our
present
situation
out
of
both
our
power
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
when
you
consider
,
that
my
utmost
presumption
could
not
make
me
hope
for
the
honour
you
now
seem
to
design
me
;
that
I
be
so
hardly
use
,
and
have
no
prospect
before
me
but
dishonour
,
you
will
allow
that
I
should
have
seem
very
little
in
earnest
in
my
profession
of
honesty
,
if
I
have
not
endeavour
to
get
away
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
resolve
not
to
think
of
marriage
;
for
I
never
see
the
man
I
could
love
,
till
your
goodness
embolden
me
to
look
up
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
he
,
make
a
very
ill
compliment
to
my
vanity
,
if
I
do
not
believe
you
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
justice
call
upon
me
to
say
,
that
it
be
,
some
thing
consider
,
beyond
my
merit
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
sweet
,
noble
expression
for
your
poor
daughter
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
 
<EOS>
and
from
my
master
too
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
this
account
of
the
interview
between
Mr.
Williams
and
himself
;
but
I
dare
not
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
time
he
will
be
reinstate
in
his
good
grace
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
,
he
have
give
order
for
the
chapel
to
be
clear
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
look
forward
with
inward
joy
,
yet
with
fear
and
trembling
!

<EOS>
Sir

,
and

.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
He

.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
near
,
he
see
me
in
a
little
confusion
,
and
be
so
kind
as
to
meet
me
:
<EOS>
give
me
your

,
say
he
,
my
poor

;
you
walk
too
fast
,
(
for
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
I
want
to
be
out
of
their
gazing
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
with
a
courtesy
,
and
he

of
the
alcove
,
and
,
in
a
most
gentleman
-
like
manner

present

They
hope
to

me
:
and
Lady
Darnford
be

I
should
be
the

.
 
<EOS>
Sir

say
,
<EOS>
good

,
by
your

;
and
salute
me
,
add
,
now
will
I
say
,
that
I
have
kiss
the
lovely
maiden
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
this
,
methought
<EOS>
I
owe
him
a
grudge
for
a
tell
-
tale
,
though
all
have
turn
out
so
happily
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.

very
gravely
follow

deserve
their
indulgence
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
so
gaze
at
me
,
that
I
could
not
look
up
;
for
I
think
it
be
one
of
the
distinction
of
person
of
condition
,
and
well
-
breed
people
,
to
put
bashful
body
out

<EOS>
Madam

make
your

necessary

,
we
have

honour

for
all
the

<EOS>
You

to
make
me
able

Mrs.

and
I

Mrs.
Jewkes
,
let
me
be
your
assistant
;
I
will
serve
the
lady
with
the
cake
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
take
the
salver
,
and
go
round
to
the
good
company
with
it
,
end
with
my

<EOS>
the
Lady

She

with
such
a
grace
,
and

give

<EOS>
o

say
I
,
I
hope

favour
will
never
make
me

,
that
it
be
my
duty
to
wait
upon
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Master
,
sweet
one
!
<EOS>
say
Sir
Simon
,
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
always
call
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
by
that
name
,
for
fear
it
should
become
a
fashion
for
all
our
lady
to
do
the
like
through
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
sir
,
say
I
,
shall
have
many
reason
to
continue
this
style
,
which
can
not
affect
your
good
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
,
say
Lady
Jones
,
you
be
very
arch
upon
us
<EOS>
but
I
see
very
well
,
that
it
will
be
the
interest
of
all
the
gentleman
,
to
bring
their
lady
into
an
intimacy
with
one
that
can
give
them
such
a
good
example
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
then
,
madam
,
say
I
,
it
must
be
after
I
have
be
polish
and
improve
by
the
honour
of
such
an
example
as
yours
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
be
very
good
and
affable
;
and
the
young
Lady
Darnford
,
who
have
wish
to
see
me
in
this
dress
,
say
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
dear
miss
,
as
she
call
me
;
but
I
have
hear
how
sweetly
this
garb
become
you
,
and
be
tell
the
history
of
it
;
and
I
beg
it
,
as
a
favour
,
that
you
may
oblige
us
with
your
appearance
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
oblige
to
your
ladyship
,
say
I
,
that
your
kind
prescription
be
so
agreeable
to
my
choice
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
be
it
your
choice
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
that
:
though
I
be
sure
your
person
must
give
,
and
not
take
,
ornament
from
any
dress
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
very
kind
,
madam
,
say
I
:
but
there
will
be
the
less
reason
to
fear
I
should
forget
the
high
obligation
I
should
have
to
the
kind
of
gentleman
,
when
I
can
delight
to
shew
the
humble
degree
from
which
his
goodness
have
raise
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Pamela
,
say
my
master
,
if
you
proceed
at
this
rate
,
I
must
insist
upon
your
first
seven
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
be
all
goodness
!
  
<EOS>
They
drink
a
glass
of
sack
each
,
and
Sir
Simon
would
make
me
do
so
too
,
say
,
It
will
be
a
reflection
,
madam
,
upon
all
the
lady
,
if
you
do
not
do
as
they
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
Sir
Simon
,
say
I
,
that
can
not
be
,
because
the
lady
'
journey
hither
make
a
glass
of
canary
a
proper
cordial
for
them
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
refuse
;
because
I
will
do
myself
the
honour
of
drink
good
health
to
you
,
and
to
all
this
worthy
company
.
  
<EOS>
say
good
Lady
Darnford
,
to
my
master
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
sir
,
we
shall
have
Mrs.
Andrews

company
at
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
very
obligingly
,
<EOS>
Madam
,
it
be
her
time
now
;
and
I
will
leave
it
to
her
choice
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
good
lady
,
then
,
will
forgive
me
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
rather
be
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
say
,
I
must
not
be
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
I
may
.
 
<EOS>
Your
reason
for
it
,
my
dear
Pamela
?
<EOS>
say
my
master
:
since
the
lady
request
it
,
I
wish
you
would
oblige
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
reply
I
,
your
goodness
will
make
me
,
every
day
,
worthy
of
the
honour
the
lady
do
me
;
and
when
I
can
persuade
myself
that
I
be
more
worthy
of
it
than
at
present
<EOS>
,
I
shall
with
great
joy
embrace
all
the
opportunity
they
will
be
pleased
to
give
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Peters
whisper
Lady
Jones
,
as
my
master
tell
me
afterwards
;
do
you
ever
see
such
excellence
,
such
prudence
,
and
discretion
?
 
<EOS>
never
in
my
life
,
say
the
other
good
lady
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
adorn
,
she
be
pleased
to
say
,
her
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
Mrs.
Peters
,
she
would
adorn
any
station
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
be
highly
delighted
,
generous
gentleman
as
he
be
!
<EOS>
with
the
favourable
opinion
of
the
lady
;
and
I
take
the
more
pleasure
in
it
,
because
their
favour
seem
to
lessen
the
disgrace
of
his
stooping
so
much
beneath
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
say
,
We
will
not
oppress
you
;
though
we
could
almost
blame
your
too
punctilious
exactness
:
but
if
we
excuse
Miss
Andrews
from
dinner
,
we
must
insist
upon
her
company
at
the
card
-
table
,
and
at
a
dish
of
tea
;
for
we
intend
to
pass
the
whole
day
with
you
,
sir
,
as
we
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
what
say
you
to
that
,
Pamela
,
say
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
reply
I
,
whatever
you
and
the
lady
please
,
I
will
cheerfully
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
,
I
be
very
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
but
Sir
Simon
rapt
out
an
oath
,
and
say
,
that
they
may
dine
together
,
if
they
would
;
but
he
would
dine
with
me
,
and
nobody
else
:
for
,
say
he
,
I
say
,
sir
,
as
Parson
Williams
say
,
(
by
which
I
find
my
master
have
tell
them
the
story
,
)
<EOS>
You
must
not
think
you
have
choose
one
that
nobody
can
like
but
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
say
,
if
I
please
they
would
take
a
turn
about
the
garden
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
I
would
very
gladly
attend
them
;
and
<EOS>
so
we
three
,
and
Lady
Jones
's
sister
-
in
-
law
,
and
Mr.
Peters
's
niece
,
walk
together
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
affable
,
kind
,
and
oblige
;
and
we
soon
enter
into
a
good
deal
of
familiarity
;
and
I
find
Miss
Darnford
a
very
agreeable
person
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
be
a
little
more
on
the
reserve
;
and
I
afterwards
hear
,
that
,
about
a
year
before
,
she
would
fain
have
have
my
master
make
his
address
to
her
:
but
though
Sir
Simon
be
reckon
rich
,
she
be
not
think
sufficient
fortune
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
to
have
him
look
down
so
low
as
me
,
must
be
a
sort
of
mortification
to
a
poor
young
lady
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
pity
her
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
all
young
person
of
my
sex
could
be
as
happy
as
I
be
like
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
tell
me
afterwards
,
that
I
leave
the
other
lady
,
and
Sir
Simon
and
Mr.
Peters
,
full
of
my
praise
:
so
that
they
could
hardly
talk
of
any
thing
else
;
one
lanche
out
upon
my
complexion
,
another
upon
my
eye
,
my
hand
,
and
,
in
short
,
for
you
will
think
me
sadly
proud
,
upon
my
whole
person
and
behaviour
;
and
they
all
magnify
my
readiness
and
obligingness
in
my
answer
,
and
the
like
:
<EOS>
and
I
be
glad
of
it
,
as
I
say
,
for
my
good
master
's
sake
,
who
seem
quite
pleased
and
rejoice
.
<EOS>
God
bless
him
for
his
goodness
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
dinner
not
be
ready
,
the
young
lady
propose
a
tune
upon
the
spinnet
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
believe
it
be
not
in
tune
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
,
they
know
it
be
but
a
few
month
ago
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
,
say
I
,
I
wish
I
have
know
it
;
though
indeed
,
lady
,
add
I
,
since
you
know
my
story
,
I
must
own
,
that
my
mind
have
not
be
long
in
tune
,
to
make
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
would
make
me
play
upon
it
,
and
sing
to
it
;
which
I
do
,
a
song
my
dear
good
lady
make
me
learn
,
and
use
to
be
pleased
with
,
and
which
she
bring
with
her
from
Bath
:
and
the
lady
be
much
take
with
the
song
,
and
be
so
kind
as
to
approve
my
performance
:
<EOS>
and
Miss
Darnford
be
pleased
to
compliment
me
,
that
I
have
all
the
accomplishment
of
my
sex
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
have
have
a
good
lady
,
in
my
master
's
mother
,
who
have
spare
no
pain
nor
cost
to
improve
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
wish
Mr.

could
be
prevail
upon
to
give
a
ball
on
an
approach
happy
occasion
,
that
we
may
have
a
dancing
-
match
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
say
I
do
;
though
I
do
not
say
so
:
for
these
occasion
,
I
think
,
be
too
solemn
for
the
principal
,
at
least
of
our
sex
,
to
take
part
in
,
especially
if
they
have
the
same
thought
of
that
solemnity
that
I
have
:
for
,
indeed
,
though
I
have
before
me
a
prospect
of
happiness
,
that
may
be
envy
by
lady
of
high
rank
,
yet
I
must
own
to
you
,
my
dear
parent
,
that
I
have
something
very
awful
upon
my
mind
,
when
I
think
of
the
matter
;
and
shall
,
more
and
more
,
as
it
draw
near

<EOS>
I.
      
Go

gently
steal

and
underneath
her
pillow
lie

there
,
in
soft
dream
,
my
love
reveal
,
    
that
love
which
I
must
still
conceal

and

wrapt
in
awful
silence

die

Her

My

<EOS>
why

<EOS>
Expect

a

<EOS>
then

<EOS>
You

I

<EOS>
no

sir

say
I

not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
grievously
dash
to
see
all
those
strange
lady
and
gentleman
;
and
now
to
see
Mr.
Williams
before
them
,
as
some
of
them
refuse
his
application
for
me
,
when
I
want
to
get
away
,
it
will
a
little
shock
me

to
see
them
smile
,
in
recollect
what
have
pass
of
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
guard
your
heart
against
surprise
,
though
you
shall
see
,
when
you
come
down
,
a
man
that
I
can
allow
you
to
love
dearly
;
though
hardly
preferably
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
this
surprise
me
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
he
begin
to
be
jealous
of
me

<EOS>
what
will
become
of
me

(
for
he
look
very

)
if
any
turn
should
happen
now
!
 
<EOS>
My
heart
ache
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
be
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
go
down
as
brisk
as
I
can
,
that
nothing
may
be
impute
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
wish
this
Mr.
Williams
have
not
be
there
now
,
when
they
be
all
there
;
because
of
their
fleer
at
him
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
otherwise
I
should
be
glad
to
see
the
poor
gentleman
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
think
him
a
good
man
,
and
he
have
suffer
for
my
sake
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
I
be
send
for
down
to
card
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
;
but
wish
I
may
continue
their
good
opinion
of
me
<EOS>
:
for
I
shall
be
very
awkward
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
,
by
his
serious
question
,
and
bid
me
guard
my
heart
against
surprise
,
<EOS>
though
I
should
see
,
when
I
come
down
,
a
man
he
can
allow
me
to
love
dearly
,
though
hardly
well
than
himself
,
have
quite
alarm
me
,
and
make
me
sad
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
love
me
!
 
<EOS>
but
whether
he
do
or
not
,
I
be
in
for
it
now
,
over
head
and
ear
,
I
doubt
,
and
can
not
help
love
him
;
'
tis
a
folly
to
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
be
sure
I
can
not
love
any
man
preferably
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
know
what
he
mean
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
mother
,
must
I
write
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
well
may
my
good
master
say
so
mysteriously
as
he
do
,
about
guard
my
heart
against
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
surprised
in
my
life

and
never
could
see
a
man
I
love
so
dearly
!
 
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
mother

it
be
my

dear
father

and
not
Mr.
Williams

that
be
below
ready
to
receive
and
to
bless
your
daughter
!
<EOS>
and
both
my
master
and
he
enjoin
me
to
write
how
the
whole
matter
be
,
and
what
my
thought
be
on
this
joyful
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
take
the
matter
from
the
beginning
,
that
Providence
direct
his
foot
to
this
house

to
this
time
,
as
I
have
have
it
from
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
from
my
master
,
my
father
,
the
lady
,
and
my
own
heart
and
conduct
,
as
far
as
I
know
of
both
;
because
they
command
it
,
and
you
will
be
pleased
with
my
relation
and
so
,
as
you
know
how
I
come
by
the
connexion
,
will
make
one
uniform
relation

<EOS>
It
seem
,
then
,
my
dear
father
and
you
be
so
uneasy
to
know
the
truth
of
the
story
which
Thomas
have
tell
you
,
that
fear
I
be
betray
,
and
quite
undone
,
he
get
leave
of
absence
,
and
set
out
the
day
after

be
there
;
and
so
,
on
Friday
morning
,
he
get
to
the
neighbouring
town
;
and
there
he
hear
,
that
the
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
be
at
my
master

,
at
a
great
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
neckcloth
(
which
he
bring
in
his
pocket
)
at
an
alehouse
there
,
and
get
shave
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
after
he
have
eat
some
bread
and
cheese
,
and
drank
a
can
of
ale
,
he
set
out
for
my
master
's
house
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
dread
for
me
,
and
in
much
fear
of
be
brow
-
beat
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
ask
,
at
the
alehouse
,
what
family
the
"
squire

<EOS>

<EOS>
he
say

<EOS>
They
tell
him
,

<EOS>
this

Mr.

It

<EOS>
I
 
fear
you
have
delude
her
with
strange
hope
;
and
would
make
me
believe
impossibility
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
he
,
do
you
tell
my
dear
Pamela
's
good

,
when
I
go
out
,
all
you

concern
me
,
and
your

<EOS>
meantime
,
make
much
of

and
set
out
what
you

;
and
make

drink
a
glass
of
what
he

<EOS>
if

<EOS>
She

;
and
he
take
my
father
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
believe
me
,
good
man
,
and
be
easy
;
for
I
can
not

<EOS>
Your

<EOS>
I
be
glad

<EOS>
and
so

drink
a
bumper
to
this
most
obliging
health
.
  
<EOS>
what
do
I
hear
?
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
surely
be
!
<EOS>
say
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
and
your
honour
be
too
good
,
I
hope
,
to
mock
a
poor
old
man
 
<EOS>
this
ugly
story
,
sir
,
of
the
bishop
,
run
in
my
head
 
<EOS>
but
you
say
I
shall
see
my
dear
child
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
see
her
honest
.
 
<EOS>
if
not
,
poor
as
I
be
,
I
would
not
own
her
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
bid
<EOS>
Mrs.
jewke
not
to
let
me
know
yet
,
that
my
father
be
come
;
and
go
to
the
company
,
and
say
,
I
have
be
agreeably
surprised
:
<EOS>
here
be
<EOS>
honest
old
Goodman
Andrews
come
full
of
grief
to
see
his
daughter
;
for
he
fear
she
be
seduce
;
and
tell
me
,
good
honest
man
,
that
,
poor
as
he
be
,
he
will
not
own
her
,
if
she
be
not
virtuous
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
say
they
all
,
with
one
voice
almost
,
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
shall
we
not
see
the
good
old
man
you
have
so
praise
for
his
plain
good
sense
,
and
honest
heart
?
<EOS>
if
,
say
he
,
I
think
Pamela
would
not
be
too
much
affect
with
the
surprise
,
I
would
make
you
all
witness
to
their
first
interview
;
for
never
do
daughter
love
a
father
,
or
a
father
a
daughter
,
as
they
two
do
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
,
and
all
the
lady
,
and
the
gentleman
too
,
beg
it
may
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
not
this
very
cruel
,
my
dear
mother
?
 
<EOS>
for
well
may
they
think
I
should
not
support
myself
in
such
an
agreeable
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
kindly
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
fear
,
that
the
dear
girl
may
be
too
much
affect
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
say
Lady
Darnford
,
we
will
all
help
to
keep
up
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
say
he
,
I
will
go
up
,
and
prepare
her
;
but
will
not
tell
her
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
come
up
to
me
,
as
I
have
say
,
and
amuse
me
about
Mr.
Williams
,
to
half
prepare
me
for
some
surprise
;
though
that
could
not
have
be
any
thing
to
this
:
and
he
leave
me
,
as
I
say
,
in
that
suspense
,
at
his
mystical
word
,
say
,
He
would
send
to
me
,
when
they
be
go
to
card
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
go
from
me
to
my
father
,
and
ask
if
he
have
eat
any
thing
.
<EOS>
no
,
say
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
the
good
man
's
heart
be
so
full
,
he
can
not
eat
,
nor
do
any
thing
,
till
he
have
see
his
dear
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
that
shall
soon
be
,
say
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
you
come
in
with
me
;
for
she
be
go
to
sit
down
with
my
guest
,
to
a
game
at
quadrille
;
and
I
will
send
for
her
down
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
my
father
,
do
not
,
do
not
let
me
;
I
be
not
fit
to
appear
before
your
guest
;
let
me
see
my
daughter
by
myself
,
I
beseech
you
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
,
They
all
know
your
honest
character
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
and
long
to
see
you
,
for
Pamela
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
take
my
father
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
him
in
,
against
his
will
,
to
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
kindly
say
,
Ladies
and
gentleman
,
I
present
to
you
one
of
the
honest
man
in
England
,
my
good
Pamela
's
father
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
go
to
him
,
and
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
We
be
all
glad
to
see
you
,
sir
;
you
be
the
happy
man
in
the
world
in
a
daughter
;
whom
we
never
see
before
to
-
day
,
but
can
not
enough
admire
.
  
<EOS>
say
my
master
,
this
gentleman
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
be
the
minister
of
the
parish
;
but
be
not
young
enough
for
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
this
airy
expression
,
my
poor
father
say
,
make
him
fear
,
for
a
moment
,
that
all
be
a
jest
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
also
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
ay
,
you
have
a
sweet
daughter
,
honesty
;
we
be
all
in
love
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
lady
come
,
and
say
very
fine
thing
:
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
particularly
,
that
he
may
think
himself
the
happy
man
in
England
,
in
such
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
and
please
you
,
madam
,
say
he
,
she
be
but
virtuous
,
'
tis
all
in
all
:
for
all
the
rest
be
accident
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
his
honour
have
be
too
much
upon
the
jest
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
Mrs.
Peters
,
we
be
all
witness
,
that
he
intend
very
honourably
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
comfort
,
say
he
,
and
wipe
his
eye
,
that
such
good
lady
say
so
 
<EOS>
but
I
wish
I
could
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
They
would
have
have
him
sit
down
by
them
;
but
he
would
only
sit
behind
the
door
,
in
the
corner
of
the
room
,
so
that
one
could
not
soon
see
him
as
one
come
in
;
because
the
door
open
against
him
,
and
hide
him
almost
.
<EOS>
the
lady
all
sit
down
;
and
my
master
say
,
Desire
Mrs.
jewke
to
step
up
,
and
tell
Mrs.
Andrews
the
lady
wait
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
down
I
come
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
rise
,
and
meet
me
at
the
door
,
and
say
,
well
,
Miss
Andrews
,
we
long
for
your
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
my
dear
father
;
and
it
seem
his
heart
be
too
full
to
speak
;
and
he
get
up
,
and
sit
down
three
or
four
time
successively
,
unable
to
come
to
me
,
or
to
say
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
look
that
way
:
but
I
would
not
,
suppose
it
be
Mr.
Williams
.
<EOS>
and
they
make
me
sit
down
between
Lady
Darnford
and
Lady
Jones
;
and
ask
me
,
what
we
should
play
at
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
at
what
your
ladyship
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
to
see
them
smile
,
and
look
upon
me
,
and
to
that
corner
of
the
room
;
but
I
be
afraid
of
look
that
way
,
for
fear
of
see
Mr.
Williams
;
though
my
face
be
that
way
too
,
and
the
table
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
say
my
master
,
do
you
send
your
letter
away
to
the
posthouse
,
my
good
girl
,
for
your
father
?
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
do
not
forget
that
:
I
take
the
liberty
to
desire
Mr.
Thomas
to
carry
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
say
he
,
I
wonder
,
will
the
good
old
couple
say
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
your
goodness
will
be
a
cordial
to
their
dear
honest
heart
!
 
<EOS>
at
that
,
my
dear
father
,
not
able
to
contain
himself
,
nor
yet
to
stir
from
the
place
,
gush
out
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
which
he
,
good
soul
!
have
be
struggle
with
,
it
seem
;
and
cry
out
,
o
my
dear
child
!
  
<EOS>
I
know
the
voice
,
and
,
lift
up
my
eye
,
and
see
my
father
,
give
a
spring
,
overturn
the
table
,
without
regard
to
the
company
,
and
throw
myself
at
his
foot
:
o
my
father
!
<EOS>
my
father
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
can
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
be
it

<EOS>
yes
,

be
!
<EOS>

be
!
 
<EOS>
o
bless
your
happy
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
say
,
and
down
I
sink
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
seem
concerned
 
I
fear
,
say
he
,
that
the
surprise
would
be
too
much
for
her
spirit
;
and
all
the
lady
run
to
me
,
and
make
me
drink
a
glass
of
water
;
and
I
find
myself
encircle
in
the
arm
of
my
dear
father
.
 
<EOS>
o
tell
me
,
say
I
,
every
thing
!
 
<EOS>
how
long
have
you
be
here
?
<EOS>
when
do
you
come
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
my
honour
mother
?
 
<EOS>
and
half
a
dozen
question
more
,
before
he
could
answer
one
.
  
<EOS>
They
permit
me
to
retire
with
my
father
;
and
then
I
pour
forth
all
my
vow
and
thanksgiving
to
God
for
this
additional
blessing
;
and
confirm
all
my
master
's
goodness
to
his
scarce
-
believe
amazement
.
<EOS>
and
we
kneel
together
,
bless
God
,
and
one
another
,
for
several
ecstatic
minute
and
my
master
come
in
soon
after
,
my

say
,
o

!
 
<EOS>
May

both
in
this
world
and

<EOS>
May

<EOS>
say

<EOS>
but

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
They

for
you
have
spoil
all
their
diversion
;
and
yet
painfully
delight
them
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrews
,
add
he
<EOS>
,
do

make
this
house
your

and
the
longer

<EOS>
after

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
and

<EOS>

his
name
!
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
but
do
you
say
he
will
marry
you
?
 
<EOS>
Can
it
be
,
that
such
a
brave
gentleman
will
make
a
lady
of
the
child
of
such
a
poor
man
as
I
?
 
<EOS>
o
the
divine
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
how
will
your
poor

support
these
happy
tiding
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
set

to
acquaint
her
with
them
:
for
I
be
but
half
happy
,
till
the
dear
good
woman
share
them
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
child
,
we
ought
to
go
into
some
far
country
to
hide
ourselves
,
that
we
may
not
disgrace
you
by
our
poverty
!
  
<EOS>
o
,
my
dear
father
,
say
I
,
now
you
be
unkind
for
the
first
time
!
 
<EOS>
Your
poverty
have
be
my
glory
,
and
my
rich
;
and
I
have
nothing
to
brag
of
,
but
that
I
ever
think
it
an
honour
,
rather
than
a
disgrace
;
because
you
be
always
so
honest
,
that
your
child
may
well
boast
of
such
a
parentage
!
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
my
dear
mother
,
do
we
pass
the
happy
moment
,
till
Miss
Darnford
come
to
me
,
and
say
,
how
do
you
do
,
dear
madam
?
 
<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
see
you
so
well
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
have
your
company
.
 
<EOS>
and
yours
too
,
good
Mr.
Andrews
,
take
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
obliging
,
I
tell
her
;
and
we
go
to
the
great
parlour
;
and
my
master
take
my
father
by
the
hand
,
and
make
him
sit
down
by
him
,
and
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
mean
-
time
,
I
make
my
excuse
to
the
lady
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
which
they
readily
grant
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
Sir
Simon
,
after
his
comical
manner
,
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
:
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
let
me
see
,
say
he
,
where
your
wing
grow
;
for
I
never
see
any
body
fly
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
you
have
break
Lady
Jones
's
shin
with
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Shew
her
else
,
madam
.
  
<EOS>
His
pleasantry
make
them
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
I
be
very
sorry
for
my
extravagancy
:
and
if
it
have
not
be
my
master
's
doing
,
I
should
have
say
,
it
be
a
fault
to
permit
me
to
be
surprised
,
and
put
out
of
myself
,
before
such
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
,
all
be
very
excusable
;
and
they
be
glad
I
suffer
no
more
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
so
kind
as
to
excuse
me
at
card
,
and
play
by
themselves
;
and
I
go
by
my
master
's
command
and
sit
on
the
other
side
,
in
the
happy
place
I
ever
be
bless
with
,
between
two
of
the
dear
man
in
the
world
to
me
,
and
each
hold
one
of
my
hand
:
 
my
father
,
every
now
and
then
,
with
tear
,
lift
up
his
eye
,
and
say
,
Could
I
ever
have
hope
this
!
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
if
he
have
be
so
kind
as
to
bring
the
paper
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
He
have
;
and
look
at
me
,
as
who
should
say
,
Must
I
give
them
to
you
now
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
be
pleased
to
let
me
have
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
pull
them
from
his
pocket
;
and
I
stand
up
,
and
,
with
my
good
duty
,
give
them
into

<EOS>
He

Pamela

<EOS>
Your

,
as
well
as
the
present
happy
alteration
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
have
them
all
again
,
for
the
writer
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
and
gentleman
would
make
me
govern
the
tea
-
table
,
whatever
I
could
do
;
and
Abraham

<EOS>
My
master
and
my
father

together
,
and
drank
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
instead
of
tea
,
and
Sir
Simon
joke
with
my
master
,
say
,
I
warrant
you
would

such
a
woman
's
man
,

so
much
,
with

<EOS>
no

no

say

time
bashfulness

other
reason

because
I
should
be
glad
to
go
to
Bedfordshire
as
soon
as
I
could

and
I
would
not
return
till
I

a
mistress

who
should
assist
me
to
repair
the
mischief
she
have
make
in
it

<EOS>
I
could
not

<EOS>

<EOS>
My

I

<EOS>
She
do
not

to
be
at
a
loss
for
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
be
I
too
sudden
,
it
would
look
as
if
I
doubt
whether
you
would
hold
in
your
mind
,
and
be
not
willing
to
give
you
time
for
reflection
:
but
otherwise
,
to
be
sure
I
ought
to
resign
myself
implicitly
to
your
will
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
,
I
want
not
time
for
reflection
:
for
I
have
often
tell
you
,
and
that
long
ago
,
I
could
not
live
without
you
:
and
my
pride
of
condition
make
me
both
tempt
and
terrify
you
to
other
term
;
but
your
virtue
be
proof
against
all
temptation
,
and
be
not
to
be
awe
by
terror
:
<EOS>
wherefore
,
as
I
could
not
conquer
my
passion
for
you
,
I
correct
myself
,
and
resolve
,
since
you
would
not
be
mine
upon
my
term
,
you
should
upon
your
own
:
<EOS>
and
now
I
desire
you
not
on
any
other
,
I
assure
you
:
and
<EOS>
I
think
the
sooner
it
be
do
,
the
well
.

much
prudence

<EOS>
but
when

I
and
my
poor

shall
have
nothing
to
do

but
to
pray
for
you
both
,
and
to
look
back
,
with
wonder
and
joy
,
on
the
way
of
Providence

touch
the

call
for
Mrs.
Jewkes

<EOS>
where

full
of
prattle

of
my

and
my
future
prospect

that
I
believe
afterwards
<EOS>
I

turn
all
into

:
but
he
indulge
me
,
and
be
transport
with
joy

to
bless
him

his
daughter

I
wish
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
have
have
well
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
part
of
it
,
say
he
,
be
what
I
have
bring
upon
myself
;
and
you
have
not
spare
me
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
 
<EOS>
He
interrupt
me
,
say
,
well
,
I
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
too
much
reason
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
find
,
plainly
enough
,
that
if
you
have
get
away
,
you
would
soon
have
be
Williams
's
wife
:
and
I
can
not
see
how
it
could
well
have
be
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
no
notion
of
it
,
or
of
be
any
body
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
so
,
say
he
;
but
it
must
have
come
as
a
thing
of
course
;
and
I
see
your
father
be
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
he
,
I
little
thought
of
the
honour
your
goodness
would
confer
upon
her
;
and
I
think
that
would
be
a
match
above
what
we
could
do
for
her
,
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
find
she
be
not
for
it
,
I
resolve
not
to
urge
her
;
but
leave
all
to
her
own
prudence
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
all
be
sincere
,
honest
,
and
open
;
and
I
speak
of
it
,
if
it
have
be
do
,
as
a
thing
that
could
hardly
well
be
avoid
;
and
I
be
quite
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
I
must
observe
,
as
I
have
a
hundred
time
,
with
admiration
,
what
a
prodigious
memory
,
and
easy
and
happy
manner
of
narration
,
this
excellent
girl
have
!
 
<EOS>
and
though
she
be
full
of
her
pretty
trick
and
artifice
,
to
escape
the
snare
I
have
lay
for
her
,
yet
all
be
innocent
,
lovely
,
and
uniformly
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
exceedingly
happy
in
a
daughter
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
be
so
in
a
wife
 
<EOS>
or
,
say
my
father
,
may
she
not
have
that
honour
!
 
<EOS>
I
fear
it
not
,
say
he
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
deserve
it
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
Pamela
,
say
my
master
,
I
be
sorry
to
find
in
some
part
of
your
journal
,
that
Mrs.
Jewkes
carry
her
order
a
little
too
far
:
and
I
the
more
take
notice
of
it
,
because
you
have
not
complain
to
me
of
her
behaviour
,
as
she
may
have
expect
for
some
part
of
it
;
though
a
good
deal
be
occasion
by
my
strict
order
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
the
insolence
to
strike
my
girl
,
I
find
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
be
a
little
provoking
,
I
believe
;
but
as
we
forgave
one
another
,
I
be
the
less
entitled
to
complain
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
you
be
very
good
;
but
if
you
have
any
particular
resentment
,
I
will
indulge
it
so
far
,
as
that
she
shall
hereafter
have
nothing
to
do
where
you
be
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
be
so
kind
,
that
I
ought
to
forgive
every
body
;
and
when
I
see
that
my
happiness
be
bring
about
by
the
very
mean
that
I
think
then
my
great
grievance
,
I
ought
to
bless
those
mean
,
and
forgive
all
that
be
disagreeable
to
me
at
the
same
time
,
for
the
great
good
that
hath
issue
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
say
he
,
and
kiss
me
,
be
sweetly
consider
!
<EOS>
and
it
shall
be
my
part
to
make
you
amend
for
what
you
have
suffer
,
that
you
may
still
think
light
of
the
one
,
and
have
cause
to
rejoice
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
father
's
heart
be
full
;
and
he
say
,
with
his
hand
fold
,
and
lift
up
,
Pray
,
sir
,
let
me
go
 
<EOS>
let
me
go
 
to
my
dear
wife
,
and
tell
her
all
these
bless
thing
,
while
my
heart
hold
;
for
it
be
ready
to
burst
with
joy
!
 
<EOS>
good
man
!
<EOS>
say
my
master
 
I
hope
to
hear
this
honest
heart
of
yours
speak
at
your
lip
.
 
<EOS>
I
enjoin
you
,
Pamela
,
to
continue
your
relation
,
as
you
have
opportunity
;
and
though
your
father
be
here
,
write
to
your
mother
,
that
this
wondrous
story
be
perfect
,
and
we
,
your
friend
,
may
read
and
admire
you
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
pray
,
pray
do
,
my
child
,
say
my
father
;
and
this
be
the
reason
that
I
write
on
,
my
dear
mother
,
when
I
think
not
to
do
it
,
because
my
father
could
tell
you
all
that
pass
while
he
be
here
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
take
notice
of
my
psalm
,
and
be
pleased
to
commend
it
;
and
say
,
that
I
have
very
charitably
turn
the
last
verse
,
which
,
in
the
original
,
be
full
of
heavy
curse
,
to
a
wish
that
shew
I
be
not
of
an
implacable
disposition
though
my
then
usage
may
have
excuse
it
,
if
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
shall
sing
it
to
me
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
breakfast
,
add
he
,
if
you
have
no
objection
,
Pamela
,
we
will
take
an
airing
together
;
and
it
shall
be
in
the
coach
,
because
we
will
have
your
father
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
excuse
himself
;
but
my
master
would
have
it
so
:
but
he
be
much
ashamed
,
because
of
the
meanness
of
his
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
would
make
us
both
breakfast
with
him
on
chocolate
;
and
he
say
,
I
would
have
you
,
Pamela
,
begin
to
dress
as
you
use
to
do
;
for
now
,
at
least
,
you
may
call
your
two
other
bundle
your
own
;
and
if
you
want
any
thing
against
the
approach
occasion
,
private
as
I
design
it
,
I
will
send
to
Lincoln
for
it
,
by
a
special
messenger
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
My
good
lady
's
bounty
,
and
his
own
,
have
set
me
much
above
my
degree
,
and
I
have
very
good
thing
of
all
sort
;
and
I
do
not
desire
any
other
,
because
I
would
not
excite
the
censure
of
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
that
would
be
a
different
thing
,
he
be
pleased
to
say
,
when
he
publicly
own
his
nuptial
,
after
we
come
to
the
other
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
at
present
,
if
I
be
satisfied
,
he
would
not
make
word
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Mr.
Andrews
,
say
he
,
to
my
father
,
you
will
not
leave
us
till
you
see
the
affair
over
,
and
then
you
will
be
sure
I
mean
honourably
:
and
,
besides
,
Pamela
will
be
induce
to
set
the
day
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
he
,
I
bless
God
I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
your
meaning
honourably
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
will
excuse
me
,
if
I
set
out
on
Monday
morning
,
very
early
,
to
my
dear
wife
,
and
make
her
as
happy
as
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
Pamela
,
say
my
good
master
,
may
it
not
be
perform
on
Tuesday
?
<EOS>
and
then
your
father
,
maybe
,
will
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
glad
to
have
have
it
to
-
morrow
,
add
he
;
but
I
have
send
Monsieur
Colbrand
for
a
license
,
that
,
you
may
have
no
scruple
unanswered
;
and
he
can
not
very
well
be
back
before
to
-
morrow
night
,
or
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
most
agreeable
news
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
know
my
dear
father
will
want
to
be
at
home
:
and
as
you
be
so
good
to
give
me
a
fortnight
from
last
Thursday
,
I
should
be
glad
you
would
be
pleased
to
indulge
me
still
to
some
day
in
the
second
seven
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
I
will
not
be
too
urgent
;
but
the
sooner
you
fix
,
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrews
,
we
must
leave
something
to
these
Jephthah
's
daughter
,
in
these
case
,
he
be
pleased
to
say
:
I
suppose
the
little
bashful
folly
,
which
,
in
the
happy
circumstance
,
may
give
a
kind
of
regret
to
quit
the
maiden
state
,
and
an
awkwardness
at
the
entrance
into
a
new
one
,
be
a
reason
with
Pamela
;
and
so
she
shall
name
her
day
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
he
,
you
be
all
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
up
soon
after

,
take

,
in
a
happy
moment
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
of

pleased
to
call
them
;
(
allude
to
my
former
division
of
those
good
thing
my
lady
and
himself
bestow
upon
me
;
)
and
so
put
on
fine
linen
,
silk
shoe
,
and
fine
white
cotton
stocking
,
a
fine
quilt
coat
,
a
delicate
green
Mantea
silk

a

and
a
laced
cambric
handkerchief

and
clean
glove

and
,
take
my
fan
in
my
hand
,
I
,
like
a
little
proud
hussy
,
look
in
the
glass
,
and
think
myself
a
gentlewoman
once
more
;
but
I
forget
not
to
return
due
thank
,
for
be
able
to
put
on
this
dress
with
so
much
comfort

<EOS>
Mrs.

would
help
to
dress
me
,
and
compliment
me
highly
,
say

among

<EOS>
My

and
bid
the

and
to
my

and
,
while
I

desire

<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
inform

of
the
chapel
be
get
in
tolerable
order
;
and
say
,
it
look
very
well

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
Mr.
Peters

offer
to
come

;
but
would
not
stay
to
dine
with
me
,
because
he
have
company
at
his
own
house
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
intend
that
divine
service
shall
be
perform
in
it
by
one
to
whom
I
shall
make
some
yearly
allowance
,
as
a

<EOS>
when

sometimes
,
the
coach
stopt
,
and
my
master

and
lead

and

very
pretty
summer
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
my
father
,
if
he
choose
to
walk
out
,
or
go
on
in
the
coach
to
the
farther
end
?
 
<EOS>
He
,
poor
man
,
choose
to
go
on
in
the
coach
,
for
fear
,
he
say
,
any
gentry
should
be
walk
there
;
and
he
tell
me
,
he
be
most
of
the
way
upon
his
knee
in
the
coach
,
thank
God
for
his
gracious
mercy
and
goodness
;
and
beg
a
blessing
upon
my
good
master
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
quite
astonished
,
when
we
come
into
the
shady
walk
,
to
see
Mr.
Williams
there
.
 
<EOS>
see
there
,
say
my
master
,
there
be
poor
Williams
,
take
his
solitary
walk
again
,
with
his
book
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
it
seem
,
it
be
so
contrived
;
for
Mr.
Peters
have
be
,
as
I
since
find
,
desire
to
tell
him
to
be
in
that
walk
at
such
an
hour
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
old
acquaintance
,
say
my
master
,
again
have
I
meet
you
in
this
place
?
<EOS>
what
book
be
you
now
read
?
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
it
be
Boileau
's
Lutrin
.
 
<EOS>
say
my
master
<EOS>
,
You
see
I
have
bring
with
me
my
little
fugitive
,
that
would
have
be
:
while
you
be
perfect
yourself
in
French
,
I
be
try
to
learn
English
;
and
hope
soon
to
be
master
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mine
,
sir
,
say
he
,
be
a
very
beautiful
piece
of
French
:
but
your
English
have
no
equal
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
very
polite
,
Mr.
Williams
,
say
my
master
:
<EOS>
and
he
that
do
not
think
as
you
do
,
deserve
no
share
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
Pamela
,
add
he
,
very
generously
,
why
so
strange
,
where
you
have
once
be
so
familiar
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
both
,
<EOS>
that
I
mean
not
,
by
this
interview
,
to
insult
Mr.
Williams
,
or
confound
you
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
say
,
Mr.
Williams
,
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
well
;
and
though
the
generous
favour
of
my
good
master
have
happily
change
the
scene
,
since
you
and
I
last
see
one
another
,
I
be
nevertheless
very
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
acknowledge
,
with
gratitude
,
your
good
intention
,
not
so
much
to
serve
me
,
as
me
,
but
as
a
person
 
that
then
have
great
reason
to
believe
herself
in
distress
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
sir
,
add
I
,
to
my
master
,
your
goodness
will
permit
me
to
say
this
.
  
<EOS>
You
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
may
make
what
acknowledgment
you
please
to
Mr.
Williams
's
good
intention
;
and
I
would
have
you
speak
as
you
think
;
but
I
do
not
apprehend
myself
to
be
quite
so
much
oblige
to
those
intention
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
Mr.
Williams
,
I
beg
leave
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
know
well
,
that
,
by
education
,
you
be
no
libertine
;
nor
have
I
reason
to
think
you
so
by
inclination
;
and
,
when
you
come
to
reflect
,
I
hope
you
would
not
be
displeased
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
no
small
motive
to
me
,
at
first
,
to
do
as
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
but
Mr.
Williams
,
say
my
master
,
could
you
think
I
should
have
have
reason
to
thank
you
,
if
,
love
one
person
above
all
her
sex
,
you
have
rob
me
of
her
,
and
marry
her
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
you
be
to
consider
,
that
she
be
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
,
and
a
quite
new
one
to
you
;
that
I
have
send
her
down
to
my
own
house
,
for
well
secure
her
;
and
that
you
,
who
have
access
to
my
house
,
could
not
effect
your
purpose
,
without
be
guilty
,
in
some
sort
,
of
a
breach
of
the
law
of
hospitality
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
my
design
upon
her
,
I
own
they
have
not
the
good
appearance
;
but
still
I
be
not
answerable
to
Mr.
Williams
for
those
;
much
less
could
you
be
excuse
to
invade
a
property
so
very
dear
to
me
,
and
to
endeavour
to
gain
an
interest
in
her
affection
,
when
you
could
not
be
certain
that
matter
would
not
turn
out
as
they
have
actually
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
own
,
say
he
,
that
some
part
of
my
conduct
seem
exceptionable
,
as
you
state
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
I
be
but
a
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
interest
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
to
incur
your
displeasure
;
and
when
you
think
of
every
thing
,
and
the
inimitable
grace
of
person
,
and
perfection
of
mind
,
that
adorn
this
excellent
lady
,
(
so
he
call
me
,
)
<EOS>
you
will
,
perhaps
,
find
your
generosity
allow
something
as
an
extenuation
of
a
fault
,
which
your
anger
would
not
permit
as
an
excuse
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
do
,
say
my
master
;
nor
do
I
meet
you
here
to
be
angry
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Pamela
know
not
that
she
should
see
you
:
<EOS>
and
now
you
be
both
present
,
I
would
ask
you
,
Mr.
Williams
,
<EOS>
if
,
now
you
know
my
honourable
design
towards
this
good
girl
,
you
can
really
be
almost
,
I
will
not
say
quite
,
as
well
pleased
with
the
friendship
of
my
wife
,
as
you
could
be
with
the
favour
of
Mrs.
Andrews
?
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
he
,
I
will
answer
you
truly
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
have
prefer
,
with
her
,
any
condition
that
could
have
befall
me
,
have
I
consider
only
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
I
be
very
far
from
have
any
encouragement
to
expect
her
favour
;
and
I
have
much
more
reason
to
believe
,
that
,
if
she
could
have
hope
for
your
goodness
,
her
heart
would
have
be
too
much
pre
-
engaged
to
think
of
any
body
else
.
 
<EOS>
and
give
me
leave
further
to
say
,
sir
,
that
,
though
I
tell
you
sincerely
my
thought
,
be
I
only
to
consider
myself
;
<EOS>
yet
,
when
I
consider
her
good
,
and
her
merit
,
I
should
be
highly
ungenerous
,
be
it
put
to
my
choice
,
if
I
could
not
wish
her
in
a
condition
so
much
superior
to
what
I
could
raise
her
to
,
and
so
very
answerable
to
her
merit
.
  
<EOS>
Pamela
,
say
my
master
,
you
be
oblige
to
Mr.
Williams
,
and
ought
to
thank
him
:
He
have
distinguish
well
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
for
me
,
who
have
like
to
have
lose
you
by
his
mean
,
I
be
glad
the
matter
be
not
leave
to
his
choice
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
add
he
,
I
give
you
Pamela
's
hand
,
because
I
know
it
will
be
pleasing
to
her
,
in
token
of
her
friendship
and
esteem
for
you
;
and
I
give
you
mine
,
that
I
will
not
be
your
enemy
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
must
say
,
that
I
think
I
owe
this
proper
manner
of
your
thinking
more
to
your
disappointment
,
than
to
the
generosity
you
talk
of
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
kiss
my
hand
,
as
my
master
give
it
him
;
and
my
master
say
,
Sir
,
you
will
go
home
and
dine
with
me
,
and
I
will
shew
you
my
little
chapel
;
and
do
you
,
Pamela
,
look
upon
yourself
at
liberty
to
number
Mr.
Williams
in
the
list
of
your
friend
.
  
<EOS>
how
generous
,
how
noble
,
be
this
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
<EOS>
(
and
so
have
I
)
have
tear
of
pleasure
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
silent
:
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Williams
say
,
Sir
,
I
shall
be
teach
,
by
your
generosity
,
to
think
myself
inexcusably
wrong
,
in
every
step
I
take
,
that
could
give
you
offence
;
and
my
future
life
shall
shew
my
respectful
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
We
walk
on
till
we
come
to
the
coach
,
where
be
my
dear
father
.
<EOS>
Pamela
,
say
my
master
,
tell
Mr.
Williams
who
that
good
man
be
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
Mr.
Williams
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
it
be
my
dear
father
!
<EOS>
and
my
master
be
pleased
to
say
,
one
of
the
honest
man
in
England
:
Pamela
owe
every
thing
that
she
be
to
be
,
as
well
as
her
being
,
to
him
;
for
,
I
think
,
she
would
not
have
bring
me
to
this
,
nor
make
so
great
resistance
,
but
for
the
good
lesson
,
and
religious
education
,
she
have
imbibe
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
say
,
take
father
's
hand
,
You
see
,
good
Mr.
Andrews
,
with
inexpressible
pleasure
,
no
doubt
,
the
fruit
of
your
pious
care
;
and
now
be
in
a
way
,
with
your
beloved
daughter
,
to
reap
the
happy
effect
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
overcome
,
say
my
dear
father
,
with
his
honour
's
goodness
:
<EOS>
but
I
can
only
say
,
I
bless
God
,
and
bless
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
and
I
be
nearer
the
coach
than
my
master
,
and
he
offer
to
draw
back
,
to
give
way
to
him
<EOS>
,
he
kindly
say
,
Pray
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
oblige
Pamela
with
your
hand
;
and
step
in
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
He
bow
,
and
take
my
hand
;
and
my
master
make
him
step
in
,
and
sit
next
me
,
all
that
ever
he
could
do
;
and
sit
himself
over
against
him
,
next
my
father
,
who
sit
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
Mr.
Andrews
,
I
tell
you
yesterday
that
the
divine
you
see
be
not
Mr.
Williams
;
I
now
tell
you
,
this
gentleman
be
:
<EOS>
and
though
I
have
be
tell
him
,
I
think
not
myself
obliged
to
his
intention
;
yet
I
will
own
that
Pamela
and
you
be
;
and
though
I
will
not
promise
to
love
him
,
I
would
have
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
Mr.
Williams
,
you
have
a
way
of
overcoming
,
that
hardly
all
my
reading
afford
an
instance
of
;
and
it
be
the
more
noble
,
as
it
be
on
this
side
,
as
I
presume
,
the
happy
ceremony
,
which
,
great
as
your
fortune
be
,
will
lay
you
under
an
obligation
to
so
much
virtue
and
beauty
,
when
the
lady
become
yours
;
for
you
will
then
have
a
treasure
that
prince
may
envy
you
.
  
<EOS>
say
my
generous
master
,
(
God
bless
him
!
)
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
,
it
be
impossible
that
you
and
I
should
long
live
at
variance
,
when
our
sentiment
agree
so
well
together
,
on
subject
the
most
material
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
quite
confounded
;
and
my
master
,
see
it
,
take
my
hand
,
and
say
,
look
up
,
my
good
girl
;
and
collect
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
injure
Mr.
Williams
and
me
so
much
,
as
to
think
we
be
cap
compliment
,
as
we
use
to
do
verse
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
answer
for
us
both
,
that
we
say
not
a
syllable
we
do
not
think
.
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
how
unequal
be
I
to
all
this
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
every
moment
that
pass
add
to
the
weight
of
the
obligation
you
oppress
me
with
.
  
<EOS>
think
not
too
much
of
that
,
say
he
most
generously
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
's
compliment
to
you
have
great
advantage
of
mine
:
<EOS>
for
,
though
equally
sincere
,
I
have
a
great
deal
to
say
,
and
to
do
,
to
compensate
the
suffering
I
have
make
you
undergo
;
and
,
at
last
,
must
sit
down
dissatisfied
,
because
those
will
never
be
balance
by
all
I
can
do
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
He
see
my
dear
father
quite
unable
to
support
these
affect
instance
of
his
goodness
;
 
and
he
let
go
my
hand
,
and
take
his
;
and
say
,
see
his
tear
,
I
wonder
not
,
my
dear
Pamela
's
father
,
that
your
honest
heart
spring
thus
to
your
eye
,
to
see
all
her
trial
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
,
that
I
have
formerly
either
power
or
will
to
act
thus
:
<EOS>
but
since
I
begin
to
resolve
on
the
change
you
see
,
I
have
reap
so
much
pleasure
in
it
,
that
my
own
interest
will
keep
me
steady
:
<EOS>
for
,
till
within
these
few
day
,
I
know
not
what
it
be
to
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Williams
,
with
tear
of
joy
in
his
eye
,
say
,
how
happily
,
sir
,
have
you
be
touch
by
the
divine
grace
,
before
you
have
be
hurry
into
the
commission
of
sin
,
that
the
deep
penitence
could
hardly
have
atone
for
!
 
<EOS>
God
have
enable
you
to
stop
short
of
the
evil
;
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
rejoice
in
the
good
,
which
now
will
be
doubly
so
,
because
you
can
receive
it
without
the
least
inward
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
You
do
well
,
say
he
,
to
remind
me
,
that
I
owe
all
this
to
the
grace
of
God
.
 
<EOS>
I
bless
Him
for
it
;
and
I
thank
this
good
man
for
his
excellent
lesson
to
his
daughter
<EOS>
;
I
thank
her
for
follow
them
:
and
I
hope
,
from
her
good
example
,
and
your
friendship
,
Mr.
Williams
,
in
time
,
to
be
half
as
good
as
my
tutoress
:
and
that
,
say
he
,
I
believe
you
will
own
,
will
make
me
,
without
disparagement
to
any
man
,
the
good
fox
-
hunter
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
be
go
to
speak
:
and
<EOS>
he
say
,
You
put
on
so
grave
a
look
,
Mr.
Williams
,
that
,
I
believe
,
what
I
have
say
,
with
you
practical
good
folk
,
be
liable
to
exception
:
but
I
see
we
be
become
quite
grave
;
and
we
must
not
be
too
serious
neither
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
happy
creature
,
my
dear
mother
,
be
your
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
o
may
my
thankful
heart
,
and
the
good
use
I
may
be
enable
to
make
of
the
blessing
before
me
,
be
a
means
to
continue
this
delightful
prospect
to
a
long
date
,
for
the
sake
of
the
dear
good
gentleman
,
who
thus
become
the
happy
instrument
,
in
the
hand
of
Providence
,
to
bless
all
he
smile
upon
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
shall
never
enough
acknowledge
the
value
he
be
pleased
to
express
for
my
unworthiness
,
in
that
he
have
prevent
my
wish
,
and
,
unasked
,
seek
the
occasion
of
be
reconcile
to
a
good
man
,
who
,
for
my
sake
,
have
incur
his
displeasure
;
and
whose
name
he
could
not
,
a
few
day
before
,
permit
to
pass
through
my
lip
!
 
<EOS>
but
see
the
wonderful
way
of
Providence
!
 
<EOS>
the
very
thing
that
I
most
dread
his
seeing
or
know
,
the
content
of
my
paper
,
have
,
as
I
hope
,
satisfy
all
his
scruple
,
and
be
a
means
to
promote
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
henceforth
let
not
us
poor
short
-
sight
mortal
pretend
to
rely
on
our
own
wisdom
;
or
vainly
think
,
that
we
be
absolutely
to
direct
for
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
abundant
reason
,
I
be
sure
,
to
say
,
that
,
when
I
be
most
disappointed
,
I
be
nearer
my
happiness
:
<EOS>
for
have
I
make
my
escape
,
which
be
so
often
my
chief
point
in
view
,
and
what
I
have
place
my
heart
upon
,
I
have
escape
the
blessing
now
before
me
,
and
fall
,
perhaps
headlong
,
into
the
misery
I
would
have
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
after
all
,
it
be
necessary
I
should
take
the
step
I
do
,
to
bring
on
this
wonderful
turn
:
o
the
unsearchable
wisdom
of
God
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
much
ought
I
to
adore
the
divine
goodness
,
and
humble
myself
,
who
be
make
a
poor
instrument
,
as
I
hope
,
not
only
to
magnify
his
graciousness
to
this
fine
gentleman
and
myself
,
but
also
to
dispense
benefit
to
other
!
 
<EOS>
which
God
of
his
mercy
grant
!
  
<EOS>
in
the
agreeable
manner
I
have
mention
,
do
we
pass
the
time
in
our
second
happy
tour
;
and
I
think
Mrs.
Jewkes
would
have
sink
into
the
ground
,
when
she
see
Mr.
Williams
bring
in
the
coach
with
us
,
and
treat
so
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
We
dine
together
in
a
most
pleasant
,
easy
,
and
frank
manner
;
and
I
find
I
need
not
,
from
my
master
's
generosity
,
to
be
under
any
restraint
,
as
to
my
conduct
to
this
good
clergyman
:
<EOS>
for
he
,
so
often
as
he
fancy
I
be
reserve
,
move
me
to
be
free
with
him
,
and
to
him
;
and
several
time
call
upon
me
to
help
my
father
and
Mr.
Williams
;
and
seem
to
take
great
delight
in
see
me
carve
,
as
,
indeed
,
he
do
in
every
thing
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
we
go
and
look
into
the
chapel
,
which
be
a
very
pretty
one
,
and
very
decent
;
and
,
when
finish
as
he
design
it
,
against
his
next
come
down
,
will
be
a
very
pretty
place
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
,
my
dear
mother
,
when
I
first
set
my
foot
in
it
,
throb
a
good
deal
,
with
awful
joy
,
at
the
thought
of
the
solemnity
,
which
,
I
hope
,
will
in
a
few
day
be
perform
here
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
come
up
towards
the
little
pretty
altar
-
piece
,
while
they
be
look
at
a
communion
-
picture
,
and
say
it
be
prettily
do
,
I
gently
stept
into
a
corner
,
out
of
sight
,
and
pour
out
my
soul
to
God
on
my
knee
,
in
supplication
and
thankfulness
,
that
,
after
have
be
so
long
absent
from
divine
service
,
the
first
time
I
enter
into
a
house
dedicate
to
his
honour
,
should
be
with
such
blessed
prospect
before
me
;
and
beg
of
God
to
continue
me
humble
,
and
to
make
me
not
unworthy
of
his
mercy
;
and
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
bless
the
next
author
of
my
happiness
,
my
good
master
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
my
master
say
,
where
be
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
break
off
sooner
than
I
would
,
and
go
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
Mr.
Williams
,
I
hope
I
have
not
so
offend
you
by
my
conduct
past
,
(
for
really
it
be
what
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
,
)
as
that
you
will
refuse
to
officiate
,
and
to
give
us
your
instruction
here
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
be
so
kind
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
offer
it
;
but
I
know
it
would
be
inconvenient
for
him
;
and
,
besides
,
I
be
willing
to
make
this
request
to
you
an
introduction
to
our
reconciliation
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
he
,
most
willingly
,
and
most
gratefully
,
will
I
obey
you
:
<EOS>
though
,
if
you
expect
a
discourse
,
I
be
wholly
unprepared
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
it
,
reply
he
,
point
to
any
particular
occasion
;
but
if
you
have
one
upon
the
text
 
there
be
more
joy
in
Heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
,
than
over
ninety
-
nine
just
person
that
need
no
repentance
;
and
if
it
make
me
not
such
a
sad
fellow
as
to
be
point
at
by
mine
and
the
lady
'
servant
we
shall
have
here
,
I
shall
be
well
content
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
general
subject
,
add
he
,
make
me
speak
of
that
;
but
any
one
you
please
will
do
;
for
you
can
not
make
a
bad
choice
,
I
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
he
,
I
have
one
upon
that
text
;
but
I
be
ready
to
think
,
that
a
thanksgiving
one
,
which
I
make
on
a
great
mercy
to
myself
,
if
I
may
be
permit
to
make
my
own
acknowledgment
of
your
favour
the
subject
of
a
discourse
,
will
be
suitable
to
my
grateful
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
text
;
 
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
;
for
mine
eye
have
see
thy
salvation
.
  
<EOS>
that
text
,
say
I
,
will
be
a
very
suitable
one
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
not
so
,
Pamela
,
say
my
master
;
because
I
do
not
let
you
depart
in
peace
;
but
I
hope
you
will
stay
here
with
content
.
  
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
see
God
's
salvation
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
add
I
,
<EOS>
if
any
body
ever
have
reason
,
I
have
to
say
,
with
the
blessed
virgin
,
My
soul
doth
magnify
the
Lord
;
for
he
hath
regard
the
low
estate
of
his
handmaiden
 
and
exalt
one
of
low
degree
.
  
<EOS>
say
my
good
father
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
if
there
be
time
for
it
,
the
book
of
Ruth
would
afford
a
fine
subject
for
the
honour
do
my
dear
child
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
good
Mr.
Andrews
,
say
my
master
,
should
you
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
story
,
and
Mr.
Williams
will
confirm
what
I
say
,
that
my
good
girl
here
will
confer
at
least
as
much
honour
as
she
will
receive
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
be
inexpressibly
generous
;
but
I
shall
never
think
so
.
<EOS>
why
,
my
Pamela
,
say
he
,
that
be
another
thing
:
It
will
be
good
for
me
to
think
you
will
;
and
it
will
be
kind
in
you
to
think
you
shall
not
;
and
then
we
shall
always
have
an
excellent
rule
to
regulate
our
conduct
by
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
be
not
this
finely
,
nobly
,
wisely
say
,
my
dear
mother
?
 
<EOS>
o
what
a
bless
thing
it
be
to
be
match
to
a
man
of
sense
and
generosity
!
 
<EOS>
how
edifying
!
 
<EOS>
how
!
 
<EOS>
but
what
shall
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
at
loss
for
word
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
say
,
when
we
come
out
of
the
little
chapel
,
He
would
go
home
,
and
look
over
his
discourse
,
for
one
for
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
say
,
I
have
one
thing
to
say
before
you
go
 
<EOS>
when
my
jealousy
,
on
account
of
this
good
girl
,
put
me
upon
such
a
vindictive
conduct
to
you
,
you
know
I
take
a
bond
for
the
money
I
have
cause
you
to
be
trouble
for
:
<EOS>
I
really
be
ashamed
of
the
matter
;
because
I
never
intend
,
when
I
present
it
to
you
,
to
have
it
again
,
you
may
be
sure
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
not
what
may
happen
between
you
and
her
,
nor
how
far
matter
may
have
go
between
you
;
and
so
I
be
willing
to
have
that
in
awe
over
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
it
be
no
extraordinary
present
,
therefore
,
to
give
you
up
your
bond
again
cancel
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
take
it
from
his
pocket
,
and
give
it
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
add
he
,
all
the
charge
attend
it
,
and
the
trouble
you
have
,
be
defray
by
my
attorney
<EOS>
;
I
order
that
they
should
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
,
sir
,
say
he
;
and
ten
thousand
thank
to
you
for
this
goodness
,
and
the
kind
manner
in
which
you
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
go
,
Mr.
Williams
,
say
he
,
shall
my
chariot
carry
you
home
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
answer
he
,
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
time
will
be
so
well
employ
all
the
way
,
in
thinking
of
your
favour
,
that
I
choose
to
meditate
upon
them
,
as
I
walk
home
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
father
be
a
little
uneasy
about
his
habit
,
for
appear
at
chapel
next
day
,
because
of
Misses
Darnford
and
the
servant
,
for
fear
,
poor
man
<EOS>
,
he
should
disgrace
my
master
;
and
he
tell
me
,
when
he
be
mention
this
,
of
my
master
's
kind
present
of
twenty
guinea
for
clothe
,
for
you
both
;
which
make
my
heart
truly
joyful
.
 
<EOS>
but
oh
!
to
be
sure
,
I
can
never
deserve
the
hundredth
part
of
his
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
almost
a
hard
thing
to
be
under
the
weight
of
such
deep
obligation
on
one
side
,
and
such
a
sense
of
one
's
own
unworthiness
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
what
a
Godlike
power
be
that
of
do
good
!
 
<EOS>
I
envy
the
rich
and
the
great
for
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
come
to
us
just
then
,
I
say
,
oh
!
<EOS>
sir
,
will
your
bounty
know
no
limit
?
 
<EOS>
My
dear
father
have
tell
me
what
you
have
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
trifle
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
a
little
earnest
only
of
my
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
say
no
more
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
do
I
not
hear
the
good
man
express
some
sort
of
concern
for
somewhat
?
 
<EOS>
hide
nothing
from
me
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
only
,
sir
,
say
I
,
he
know
not
how
to
absent
himself
from
divine
service
,
and
yet
be
afraid
of
disgrace
you
by
appear
.
  
<EOS>
Fie
,
Mr.
Andrews
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
<EOS>
I
think
you
know
that
the
outward
appearance
be
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
as
good
a
habit
inwardly
as
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
your
father
be
not
so
much
thin
than
I
be
,
nor
much
short
;
he
and
I
will
walk
up
together
to
my
wardrobe
;
though
it
be
not
so
well
stored
here
,
as
in
Bedfordshire
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
say
he
,
pleasantly
,
do
not
you
pretend
to
come
near
us
,
till
I
call
for
you
;
for
you
must
not
yet
see
how
man
dress
and
undress
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
my
father
,
I
beg
to
be
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
you
be
tell
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
not
I
,
say
my
master
:
<EOS>
pray
come
along
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
carry
him
up
stair
,
and
shew
him
several
suit
,
and
would
have
have
him
take
his
choice
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
father
be
quite
confound
:
for
my
master
see
not
any
he
think
too
good
,
and
my
father
none
that
he
think
bad
enough
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
good
master
,
at
last
,
(
he
fix
his
eye
upon
a
fine
drab
,
which
he
think
look
the
plain
,
)
<EOS>
would
help
him
to
try
the
coat
and
waistcoat
on
himself
;
and
,
indeed
,
one
would
not
have
think
it
,
because
my
master
be
tall
,
and
rather
plumper
,
as
I
think
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
see
afterwards
,
they
fit
him
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
plain
,
and
line
with
the
same
colour
,
and
make
for
travel
in
a
coach
,
please
my
poor
father
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
him
the
whole
suit
,
and
,
call
up
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
,
let
these
clothe
be
well
air
against
tomorrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrews
bring
only
with
him
his
common
apparel
,
not
think
to
stay
Sunday
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
and
pray
see
for
some
of
my
stocking
,
and
whether
any
of
my
shoe
will
fit
him
:
and
see
also
for
some
of
my
linen
;
for
we
have
put
the
good
man
quite
out
of
his
course
,
by
keep
him
Sunday
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
then
pleased
to
give
him
the
silver
buckle
out
of
his
own
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
my
good
mother
,
you
must
expect
to
see
my
dear
father
a
great
beau
.
 
<EOS>
Wig
,
say
my
master
,
he
want
none
;
for
his
own
venerable
white
lock
be
well
than
all
the
peruke
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
I
have
hat
enough
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
of
every
thing
,
sir
,
say
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
poor
father
,
when
he
come
to
me
,
could
not
refrain
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
,
say
he
,
to
comport
myself
under
these
great
favour
.
 
<EOS>
o
my
child
,
it
be
all
owe
to
the
divine
goodness
,
and
your
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
this
bless
day
all
the
family
seem
to
take
delight
to
equip
themselves
for
the
celebration
of
the
Sabbath
in
the
little
chapel
;
and
Lady
Jones
and
Mr.
Williams
come
in
her
chariot
,
and
the
two
Misses
Darnford
in
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
and
we
breakfast
together
in
a
most
agreeable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
father
appear
quite
spruce
and
neat
,
and
be
quite
caress
by
the
three
lady
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
be
at
breakfast
,
my
master
tell
Mr.
Williams
,
We
must
let
the
Psalms
alone
,
he
doubt
,
for
want
of
a
clerk
:
but
Mr.
Williams
say
,
no
,
nothing
should
be
want
that
he
could
supply
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
say
,
if
it
may
be
permit
him
,
he
would
,
as
well
as
he
be
able
,
perform
that
office
;
for
it
be
always
what
he
have
take
delight
in
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
know
he
have
learn
psalmody
formerly
,
in
his
youth
,
and
have
constantly
practise
it
in
private
,
at
home
,
on
Sunday
evening
,
(
as
well
as
endeavour
to
teach
it
in
the
little
school
he
so
unsuccessfully
set
up
,
at
the
beginning
of
his
misfortune
,
before
he
take
to
hard
labour
,
)
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
pain
for
his
undertaking
it
in
this
little
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
much
pleased
with
this
;
and
so
we
go
to
chapel
,
and
make
a
pretty
tolerable
appearance
;
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
all
the
servant
,
attend
,
but
the
cook

<EOS>
and
I
never
see
divine
service
perform
with
more
solemnity
,
nor
assist
at
with
great
devotion
and
decency
;
my
master
,
Lady
Jones
,
and
the
two
miss

set
a
lovely
example
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
father

his
part
with
great
applause
,
make
the
response
,
as
if
he
have
be
a

and
give
the
xxiiid
psalm

<EOS>
[
the
Lord

only
my
support

and
he
that
doth
me
feed

<EOS>
how
can
I
then
lack
any
thing
       
<EOS>
Whereof
<EOS>
I
stand
in
need
?
     
<EOS>
in
pasture
green
he
feedeth
me
,
       
where
I
do
safely
lie
;
     
and
after
lead
me
to
the
stream
,
       
<EOS>
which
run
most
pleasantly
.
       
<EOS>
and
when
I
find
myself
near
lose
,
       
then
home
he
doth
me
take
;
     
<EOS>
conduct
me
in
his
right
path
,
       
e'en
for
his
own

<EOS>
and
tho
<EOS>

I
be
e'en
at
death

<EOS>
yet
would
I
fear

<EOS>
for
both
thy

afford
me
comfort
still

<EOS>
Thou
hast
my

richly
spread
       
<EOS>
in
presence
of
my

<EOS>
Thou
hast
my

with
balm
refresh'd
,
       
<EOS>
My

doth
overflow

and
finally
,
while
breath
doth
last
,
       
Thy
grace
shall
me
defend
:
     
<EOS>
and
in

<EOS>
which
consist
of
but
three

and
he
read
the
line
,
and
begin
the
tune
with
a
heart
so
entirely
affect
with
the
duty
,
that
he
go
through
it
distinctly

calmly

and
Miss

<EOS>
You
must
think
how
I
rejoice
in

<EOS>
I
know
,
my
dear
mother
,
you
can
say
most
of
the
short
psalm
by
heart
;
so
I
need
not
transcribe
it
,
especially
as
your
chief
treasure
be
a
bible
;
and
a
worthy
treasure
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
nobody
make
more
or
well
use
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.

us
an
excellent

<EOS>
there

and
yet
increaseth

and
there
be
that
withholdeth

the

<EOS>
He
think

that

I
will
put
it
to

<EOS>
that
be
very

I
find

and
yet
,
add
he
,
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
have
as
well
let
it
alone
,
for
it
be
no
great
reputation
to

<EOS>
o
then
,
say
Miss
Darnford
,
pray
let

hear
it
,
to
choose
.
  
<EOS>
why
then
,
proceed
he

the
case
be
this
:
<EOS>
Pamela

I
find
,
when

(
that
is
,
add
he
,
when
she
be

for
that
be
the
upshot
of

<EOS>
in
the

which
be
intend
for

tell
them
,
that
she
be
importune
,
one
Sunday
,
by
Mrs.

but
her
spirit
not
permit
,
she
decline

but
after

she
say
,
she
recollect

that
the
cxxxviith

be
applicable
to

Mrs.

have
often

on

besought
her
to
sing
a

<EOS>
that
thereupon
she
turn
it
more
to
her

and
believe
Mrs.

a
design
against
her
honour
,
and
look
upon
her
as
her
gaoler
,
she
thus
give
her
version
of
this
psalm

Lady

<EOS>

of
your
genius
and
accomplishment
?
  
<EOS>
o

my
good
child
proud
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
my
master
very
generously
,
Pamela
can
not
be
proud
.
 
<EOS>
for
no
one
be
proud
to
hear
themselves
praise
,
but
those
who
be
not
use
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
proceed
,
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
:
                   
<EOS>
V.
      
but
yet
,
if
I
Jerusalem
      
out
of
my
heart
let
slide
;
    
then
let
my
finger
quite
forget
      
<EOS>
the
warble
harp
to
guide
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
now
,
say
my
master
,
for
Pamela
's
version
:
                   
V.
      
<EOS>
but
yet
,
if
from
my
innocence
      
<EOS>
I
ev'n
in
thought
should
slide
,
    
then
let
my
finger
quite
forget
      
<EOS>
the
sweet
spinnet
to
guide
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
read
:
                  
VI
.
      
<EOS>
and
let
my
tongue
,
within
my
mouth
,
      
be
ty'd
for
ever
fast
,
    
if
I
rejoice
,
before
I
see
      
<EOS>
Thy
full
deliv'rance
past
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
also
,
say
my
master
,
be
very
near
:
                  
VI
.
      
<EOS>
and
let
my
tongue
,
within
my
mouth
,
      
Be
lock'd
for
ever
fast
,
    
if
I
rejoice
,
before
I
see
      
My
full
deliv'rance
past
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
good
sir
,
say
I
,
oblige
me
;
do
not
read
any
further
:
pray
do
not
!
 
<EOS>
o
pray
,
madam
,
say
Mr.
Williams
,
let
me
beg
to
have
the
rest
read
;
for
I
long
to
know
whom
you
make
the
son
of
Edom
,
and
how
you
turn
the
Psalmist
's
execration
against
the
insult
Babylonians
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Williams
,
reply
I
,
you
should
not
have
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
say
my
master
,
that
be
one
of
the
good
thing
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
stand
for
Edom
's
son
;
and
we
must
not
lose
this
,
because
I
think
it
one
of
my
Pamela
's
excellency
,
that
,
though
thus
oppress
,
she
pray
for
no
harm
upon
the
oppressor
.
 
<EOS>
Read
,
Mr.
Williams
,
the
next
stanza
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
read
:
                 
VII
.
      
<EOS>
therefore
,
o
Lord
!
<EOS>
remember
now
      
<EOS>
the
cursed
noise
and
cry
,
    
that
Edom
's
son
against
us
make
,
      
<EOS>
when
they
ras'd
our
city
.
                
<EOS>
VIII
.
      
<EOS>
Remember
,
Lord
,
their
cruel
word
,
      
<EOS>
when
,
with
a
mighty
sound
,
    
They
cry
,
down
,
yea
down
with
it
,
      
<EOS>
unto
the
very
ground
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
my
master
,
here
seem
,
in
what
I
be
go
to
read
,
a
little
bit
of
a
curse
indeed
,
but
I
think
it
make
no
ill
figure
in
the
comparison
.
                 
<EOS>
VII
.
      
<EOS>
and
thou
,
Almighty
!
<EOS>
recompense
      
<EOS>
the
evil
I
endure
    
from
those
who
seek
my
sad
disgrace
,
      
so
causeless
,
to
procure
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
say
he
,
for
Edom
's
Sons
.
 
<EOS>
though
a
little
severe
in
the
imputation
.
                
<EOS>
VIII
.
      
<EOS>
Remember
,
Lord
,
this
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
      
<EOS>
when
with
a
mighty
sound
,
    
She
cry
,
<EOS>
down
with
her
chastity
,
      
down
to
the
very
ground
!
  
<EOS>
sure
,
sir
,
say
I
,
this
may
have
be
spare
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
lady
and
Mr.
Williams
say
,
no
,
by
no
mean
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
see
the
poor
wicked
woman
have
no
favourer
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
say
my
master
,
read
the
Psalmist
's
heavy
curse
:
and
Mr.
Williams
read
:
                  
IX
.
      
<EOS>
Ev'n
<EOS>
so
shalt
thou
,
o
Babylon
!
      
<EOS>
at
length
to
dust
be
bring
:
    
and
happy
shall
<EOS>
that
man
be
call'd
,
      
<EOS>
that
our
revenge
hath
work
.
                   
<EOS>
X.
      
Yea
,
bless
shall
the
man
be
call'd
      
<EOS>
that
take
thy
little
one
,
    
and
dasheth
them
in
piece
<EOS>
small
      
against
the
very
stone
.
  
<EOS>
thus
he
say
,
very
kindly
,
have
my
Pamela
turn
these
line
:
                  
IX
.
      
<EOS>
Ev'n
<EOS>
so
shalt
thou
,
o
wicked
one
!
      
<EOS>
at
length
to
shame
be
bring
;
    
and
happy
<EOS>
shall
all
those
be
<EOS>
call'd
,
      
<EOS>
that
my
deliv'rance
work
.
                   
<EOS>
X.
      
Yea
,
bless
shall
the
man
be
call'd
      
<EOS>
that
shame
thee
of
thy
evil
,
    
and
save
me
from
thy
vile
attempt
,
      
and
thee
,
too
,
from
the
d####l
.
  
<EOS>
I
fancy
this
blessed
man
,
say
my
master
smile
,
be
,
at
that
time
,
<EOS>
hope
to
be
you
,
Mr.
Williams
,
if
the
truth
be
know
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
he
,
whoever
it
be
intend
for
then
,
it
can
be
nobody
but
your
good
self
now
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
hold
up
my
head
for
the
praise
the
kind
lady
be
pleased
to
heap
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
by
this
,
they
be
very
partial
in
my
favour
;
all
because
my
master
be
so
good
to
me
,
and
love
to
hear
me
praise
;
for
I
see
no
such
excellence
in
these
line
,
as
they
would
make
me
believe
,
besides
what
be
borrow
from
the
Psalmist
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
,
as
before
,
and
the
cook
-
maid
too
,
attend
the
prayer
of
the
church
in
the
afternoon
;
and
my
dear
father
conclude
with
the
follow
stanza
of
the
cxlvth
psalm
;
suitably
magnify
the
holy
name
of
God
for
all
mercy
;
but
do
not
observe
,
altogether
,
the
method
in
which
they
stand
;
which
be
the
less
necessary
,
he
think
,
as
he
give
out
the
line
.
      
<EOS>
the
Lord
be
just
in
all
his
way
:
      
<EOS>
His
work
be
holy
all
:
    
<EOS>
and
he
be
near
all
those
that
do
      
<EOS>
in
truth
upon
him
call
.
      
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
the
desire
of
all
them
      
<EOS>
that
fear
him
,
will
fulfil
;
    
and
he
will
hear
them
when
they
cry
,
      
and
save
them
all
he
will
.
      
<EOS>
the
eye
of
all
do
wait
on
thee
;
      
Thou
dost
them
all
relieve
:
    
and
<EOS>
thou
to
each
sufficient
food
,
      
<EOS>
in
season
due
,
dost
give
.
      
<EOS>
Thou
<EOS>
openest
<EOS>
thy
plenteous
hand
,
      
and
bounteously
dost
<EOS>
fill
    
<EOS>
all
thing
whatever
,
that
do
live
,
      
with
gift
of
thy
good
will
.
      
<EOS>
My
thankful
mouth
shall
gladly
speak
      
<EOS>
the
praise
of
the
Lord
:
    
all
flesh
,
to
praise
his
holy
name
,
      
for
ever
shall
accord
.
  
<EOS>
We
walk
in
the
garden
till
tea
be
ready
;
and
as
he
go
by
the
back
-
door
,
my
master
say
to
me
,
<EOS>
of
all
the
flower
in
the
garden
,
the
sun
-
flower
be
the
fair
!
 
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
I
,
let
that
be
now
forget
!
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
hear
him
say
so
,
and
seem
a
little
out
of
countenance
:
<EOS>
Whereupon
my
master
say
,
I
mean
not
to
make
you
serious
,
Mr.
Williams
;
but
we
see
how
strangely
thing
be
bring
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
other
scene
hereabout
,
that
,
in
my
Pamela
's
danger
,
give
me
more
cause
of
concern
,
than
any
thing
you
ever
do
should
give
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
he
,
you
be
very
generous
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
and
Mr.
Williams
afterwards
walk
together
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
talk
about
general
thing
,
and
some
scholastic
subject
;
and
join
us
,
very
well
pleased
with
one
another
's
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
say
,
put
herself
on
one
side
of
me
,
as
my
master
be
on
the
other
,
but
pray
,
sir
,
when
be
the
happy
time
to
be
?
 
<EOS>
We
want
it
over
,
that
we
may
have
you
with
us
as
long
afterwards
as
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
say
my
master
,
I
would
have
it
to
-
morrow
,
or
next
day
at
farth
,
if
Pamela
will
:
for
I
have
send
for
a
license
,
and
the
messenger
will
be
here
to
-
night
,
or
early
in
the
morning
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
add
he
,
pray
,
<EOS>
Pamela
,
do
not
take
beyond
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
pleased
to
say
<EOS>
,
sure
it
will
not
be
delay
by
you
,
madam
,
more
than
need
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
now
you
be
on
my
side
,
I
will
leave
you
with
her
to
settle
it
:
and
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
she
will
not
let
little
bashful
nicety
be
important
with
her
;
and
so
he
join
the
two
miss
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
tell
me
,
I
be
to
blame
,
she
would
take
upon
her
to
say
,
if
I
delay
it
a
moment
;
because
she
understand
Lady
Davers
be
very
uneasy
at
the
prospect
,
that
it
would
be
so
;
and
if
any
thing
should
happen
,
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
say
I
,
when
he
be
pleased
to
mention
it
to
me
first
,
he
say
it
should
be
in
fourteen
day
;
and
afterwards
,
ask
me
if
I
would
have
it
in
the
first
or
the
second
seven
?
 
<EOS>
I
answer
 
for
how
could
I
do
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
He
desire
it
may
not
be
the
last
day
of
the
second
seven
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
madam
,
say
I
,
as
he
be
then
pleased
to
speak
his
mind
,
no
doubt
,
I
would
not
,
for
any
thing
,
seem
too
forward
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
say
she
,
as
he
now
urge
you
in
so
genteel
and
gentlemanly
a
manner
for
a
short
day
,
I
think
,
if
I
be
in
your
place
,
I
would
agree
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
see
me
hesitate
and
blush
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
well
,
you
know
best
;
but
I
say
only
what
I
would
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
would
consider
of
it
;
<EOS>
and
if
I
see
he
be
very
earnest
,
to
be
sure
I
should
think
I
ought
to
oblige
him
.
  
<EOS>
Misses
Darnford
be
beg
to
be
at
the
wedding
,
and
to
have
a
ball
:
and
they
say
,
Pray
,
Mrs.
Andrews
,
second
our
request
,
and
we
shall
be
greatly
oblige
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
lady
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
promise
that
,
if
I
may
.
 
<EOS>
why
so
?
say
they
.
 
<EOS>
because
,
answer
I
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
!
<EOS>
but
I
think
one
may
,
with
pleasure
,
celebrate
an
anniversary
of
one
's
nuptial
;
but
the
day
itself
 
indeed
,
lady
,
I
think
it
be
too
solemn
a
business
,
for
the
party
of
our
sex
to
be
very
gay
upon
:
it
be
a
quite
serious
and
awful
affair
:
and
I
be
sure
,
in
your
own
case
,
you
would
be
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
say
Miss
Darnford
,
<EOS>
the
more
need
one
have
to
be
as
light
-
hearted
and
merry
as
one
can
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
say
my
master
,
what
sort
of
an
answer
you
would
have
from
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
miss
say
,
She
never
hear
of
such
grave
folk
in
her
life
,
on
such
an
occasion
<EOS>
:
why
,
sir
,
say
she
,
I
hope
you
will
sing
psalm
all
day
,
and
miss
will
fast
and
pray
!
 
<EOS>
such
sackcloth
and
ash
doing
,
for
a
wedding
,
do
I
never
hear
of
!
 
<EOS>
She
speak
a
little
spitefully
,
I
think
;
and
I
return
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
enough
to
do
,
I
reckon
,
in
a
while
,
if
I
be
to
answer
every
one
that
will
envy
me
!
  
<EOS>
We
go
in
to
tea
;
and
all
that
the
lady
could
prevail
upon
my
master
for
,
be
a
dancing
match
before
he
leave
this
county
:
<EOS>
but
Miss
Darnford
say
,
It
should
then
be
at
their
house
;
for
,
truly
,
if
she
may
not
be
at
the
wedding
,
she
would
be
affront
,
and
come
no
more
hither
,
till
we
have
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
go
,
my
master
would
have
have
my
father
stay
till
the
affair
be
over
;
but
he
beg
he
may
set
out
as
soon
as
it
be
light
in
the
morning
;
for
,
he
say
,
my
mother
would
be
doubly
uneasy
at
his
stay
;
and
he
burn
with
impatience
to
let
her
know
all
the
happy
thing
that
have
befall
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
master
find
him
so
desirous
to
go
,
he
call
Mr.
Thomas
,
and
order
him
to
get
a
particular
bay
horse
ready
betime
in
the
morning
,
for
my
father
,
and
a
portmanteau
,
to
put
his
thing
in
;
and
to
attend
him
a
day
's
journey
:
<EOS>
and
if
,
say
he
,
Mr.
Andrews
choose
it
,
see
him
safe
to
his
own
home
:
<EOS>
and
,
add
he
,
since
that
horse
will
serve
you
,
Mr.
Andrews
,
to
ride
backwards
and
forwards
,
to
see
us
,
<EOS>
when
we
go
into
Bedfordshire
,
I
make
you
a
present
of
it
,
with
the
accoutrement
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
see
my
father
go
to
speak
,
he
add
,
I
will
not
be
say
nay
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
good
be
this
!
  
<EOS>
He
also
say
a
great
many
kind
thing
at
supper
-
time
,
and
give
him
all
the
paper
he
have
of
mine
;
but
desire
,
when
he
and
my
mother
have
read
them
,
that
he
would
return
them
to
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
say
,
<EOS>
so
affectionate
a
father
and
daughter
<EOS>
may
,
perhaps
,
be
glad
to
be
alone
together
;
therefore
remember
me
to
your
good
wife
,
and
tell
her
,
it
will
not
be
long
,
I
hope
,
before
I
see
you
together
;
on
a
visit
to
your
daughter
,
at
my
other
house
:
and
so
I
wish
you
good
night
,
and
a
good
journey
,
if
you
go
before
I
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
shake
hand
,
and
leave
my
dear
father
almost
unable
to
speak
,
through
the
sense
of
his
favour
and
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
believe
,
my
dear
mother
,
how
loath
I
be
to
part
with
my
good
father
;
and
he
be
also
unwilling
to
part
with
me
;
but
he
be
so
impatient
to
see
you
,
and
tell
you
the
bless
tiding
,
with
which
his
heart
overflow
,
that
I
could
hardly
wish
to
detain
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
bring
two
bottle
of
cherry
-
brandy
,
and
two
of
cinnamon
-
water
,
and
some
cake
;
and
they
be
put
up
in
the
portmanteau
,
with
my
father
's
newly
present
clothe
;
for
he
say
,
He
would
not
,
for
any
thing
,
be
see
in
them
in
his
neighbourhood
,
till
I
be
actually
know
,
by
every
body
,
to
be
marry
;
nor
would
he
lay
out
any
part
of
the
twenty
guinea
till
then
neither
,
for
fear
of
reflection
;
and
then
he
would
consult
me
as
to
what
he
would
buy
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
as
you
please
,
<EOS>
my
dear
father
;
and
I
hope
now
we
shall
often
have
the
pleasure
of
hear
from
one
another
,
without
need
any
art
or
contrivance
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
He
would
go
to
bed
betime
,
that
he
may
be
up
as
soon
as
it
be
light
;
and
so
he
take
leave
of
me
,
and
say
,
He
would
not
love
me
,
if
I
get
up
in
the
morning
to
see
him
go
;
which
would
but
make
us
both
loath
to
part
,
and
grieve
us
both
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thomas
bring
him
a
pair
of
boot
,
and
tell
him
,
He
would
call
him
up
at
peep
of
day
,
and
put
up
every
thing
over
night
;
and
so
I
receive
his
blessing
,
and
his
prayer
,
and
his
kind
promise
of
procure
the
same
from
you
,
my
dear
mother
;
and
go
up
to
my
closet
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
yet
a
half
-
pleased
one
,
if
I
may
so
say
;
for
that
,
as
he
must
go
,
he
be
go
to
the
good
of
wife
,
and
with
the
good
of
tiding
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
beg
he
would
not
work
so
hard
as
he
have
do
;
for
I
be
sure
my
master
would
not
have
give
him
twenty
guinea
for
clothe
,
if
he
have
not
design
to
do
something
else
for
him
;
and
that
he
should
be
the
less
concerned
at
receive
benefit
,
from
my
good
master
,
because
he
,
who
have
so
many
person
to
employ
in
his
large
possession
,
could
make
him
serviceable
,
to
a
degree
equivalent
,
without
hurt
any
body
else
.
  
<EOS>
He
promise
me
fair
;
and
,
pray
,
dear
mother
,
see
he
perform
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
my
master
will
not
see
this
:
for
I
will
not
send
it
you
,
at
present
,
till
I
can
send
you
the
good
of
news
;
and
the
rather
,
as
my
dear
father
can
supply
the
great
part
of
what
I
have
write
,
since
the
paper
he
carry
you
,
by
his
own
observation
.
 
<EOS>
so
good
night
,
my
dear
mother
:
<EOS>
and
God
send
my
father
a
safe
journey
,
and
a
happy
meeting
to
you
both
!

I

not
what
to

,
sir

to
all
your

I
would
not

for
any
consideration

negligently
an
honour
,
that
all
the
duty
of
a
long
life
,
be
it
to
be
lend
me
,
will
not
be
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
be
grateful
for

<EOS>
I
ought
to
resign
myself
,
in
every
thing
I
may
or
can
,
implicitly
to
your
will
.
 
<EOS>
but
 
<EOS>
but
what
?
<EOS>
say
he
,
with
a
kind
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir

say
I
,
when
from
last
Thursday
you
mention
four
day
,
I
have
reason
to
think
that
term
your
choice
;
and
my
heart
be
so
wholly
yours
,
that
I
be
afraid
of
nothing
,
but
that
I
may
be
forwarder
than
you
wish
.
 
<EOS>
impossible
,
my
dear
creature
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
and
fold
me
in
his
arm
:
<EOS>
impossible
!
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
all
,
it
shall
be
set
about
this
moment
,
and
this
happy
day
shall
make
you
mine
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
send

say
the
dear
gentleman
;
and
be

<EOS>
I
say

<EOS>

<EOS>
say
I
 
<EOS>
and
be
ready
to
sink
to

his
generous
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
why
flatter
you
then
my
fond
heart
,
reply
he
,
with
the
hope
that
it
may
?
 
<EOS>
Sir

say
I
,
I
will
tell
you
what
I
have
think
,
if
you
will
vouchsafe
me
your

<EOS>
do

say
he
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
sir

proceed
I
,
a
great
desire
,
that
,
whenever
the
day
be
,
it
may
be
on
a
Thursday
:
on
a
Thursday
my
dear
father
and
mother
be
married
;
and
,
<EOS>
though
poor
,
they
be
a
very
happy
pair
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
Thursday
your
poor
Pamela
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
Thursday
my
dear
good

take
me
from
my

into
her
protection
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
Thursday
,
sir

you
cause
me
to
be
carry
away
to
this
place
,
to
which
I
now
,
by
God

goodness
,
and
your
favour
,
owe
so
amazingly
all
my
present
prospect
;
and
on
a
Thursday
it
be
,
you
name
to
me
,
that
fourteen
day
from
that
you
would
confirm
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
if
you
please
to
indulge
my
superstitious
folly
,
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
,
<EOS>
sir
,
for
this
reason
,
when
you
bid
me
not
defer

the
last
day
of

,
that
Thursday
in
next
week
be
that
last
day
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
Pamela
,
be
a
little
superstitious
,
I
must
needs
say
;
and
I
think
you
should
begin
now
to
make
another
day
in
the
week
a
happy
one
;
as
for
example
;
on
a
Monday
,
may
you
say
,
my
father
and
mother
conclude
to
be
marry
on
the
Thursday
follow
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
Monday
,
so
many
year
ago
,
my
mother
be
prepare
all
her
matter
to
be
bring
to
bed
on
the
Thursday
follow
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
Monday
,
several
week
ago
,
it
be
that
you
have
but
two
day
more
to
stay
,
till
you
be
carry
away
on
Thursday
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
Monday
,
I
myself
,
say
he
,
well
remember
,
it
be
that
I
write
you
the
letter
,
that
prevail
on
you
so
kindly
to
return
to
me
;
and
on
the
same
day
you
do
return
to
my
house
here
;
which
I
hope
,
my
girl
,
will
be
as
propitious
an
era
as
any
you
have
name
:
<EOS>
and
now
,
lastly
,
will
you
say
,
which
will
crown
the
work
;
<EOS>
and
,
on
a
Monday
I
be

.
 
<EOS>
come

Thursday
have
reign
long
enough
o'conscience
;
let
us
now
set
Monday
in
its
place
,
or
at
least
on
an
equality
with
it
,
since
you
see
it
have
a
very
good
title
,
and
as
we
now
stand
in
the
week
before
us
,
claim
priority
:
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
hope
,
we
shall
make
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
Friday
,
Saturday
,
and
Sunday
,
as
happy
day
as
Monday
and
Thursday
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
God
's
blessing
,
move
round
,
as
the
day
move
,
in
a
delightful
circle
,
till
we
be
at
a
loss
what
day
to
prefer
to
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
o
how
charmingly
be
this
say
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
sweetly
kind
!
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
rally
my
folly
very
agreeably
;
but
do
not
let
a
little
matter
stand
in
the
way
,
when
you
be
so
generously
oblige
in
a
great
:
<EOS>
indeed
I
like
Thursday
best
,
if
I
may
choose
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
say
he
,
if
you
can
say
you
have
a
well
reason
than
this
,
I
will
oblige
you
;
else
I
will
send
away
for
the
parson
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
I
protest
,
he
be
go
!
 
<EOS>
dear
sir
,
how
I
tremble
!
 
<EOS>
stay
,
stay
,
sir
,
say
I
:
we
have
a
great
deal
to
say
first
;
I
have
a
deal
of
silly
prate
to
trouble
you
with
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
then
,
in
a
minute
,
reply
he
,
the
most
material
:
for
all
we
have
to
say
may
be
talk
of
while
the
parson
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
but
indeed
,
and
indeed
,
say
I
,
it
can
not
be
to
-
day
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
shall
it
be
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
if
it
must
not
be
on
a
Thursday
,
you
have
give
so
many
pleasant
distinction
for
a
Monday
,
<EOS>
that
let
it
then
be
next
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
a
week
still
?
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
answer
I
,
if
you
please
;
for
that
will
be
,
as
you
enjoin
,
within
the
second
seven
day
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
girl
,
say
he
,
'
twill
be
seven
month
till
next
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
let
it
,
say
he
,
if
not
to
-
morrow
,
be
on
Wednesday
;
I
protest
I
will
stay
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
sir
,
return
I
,
please
to
defer
it
,
however
,
for
one
day
more
,
and
it
will
be
my
beloved
Thursday
!
 
<EOS>
if
I
consent
to
defer
it
till
then
,
may
I
hope
,
my
Pamela
,
say
he
,
that
next
Thursday
shall
certainly
be
the
happy
day
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
I
and
I
be
sure
I
look
very
foolishly
!
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
why
should
I
,
with
such
a
fine
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
and
whom
I
so
dearly
love
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
much
to
my
honour
too
?
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
greatly
awful
upon
my
mind
,
in
the
solemn
circumstance
,
and
a
change
of
condition
never
to
be
recall
,
though
all
the
prospect
be
so
desirable
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
but
wonder
at
the
thoughtless
precipitancy
with
which
most
young
folk
run
into
this
important
change
of
life
!
  
<EOS>
so
now
,
my
dear
parent
,
have
I
be
bring
to
fix
so
near
a
day
as
next
Thursday
;
and
this
be
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
o
dear
,
it
make
one
out
of
breath
almost
to
think
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
this
,
though
,
be
a
great
cut
off
;
a
whole
week
out
of
ten
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
be
not
too
forward
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
if
it
oblige
my
dear
master
,
I
be
justified
;
for
he
deserve
of
me
all
thing
in
my
poor
power
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
he
ride
out
on
horseback
,
attend
by
Abraham
,
and
do
not
return
till
night
.
 
<EOS>
how
by
degree
thing
steal
upon
one
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
even
this
small
absence
tedious
;
and
the
more
,
as
we
expect
him
home
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
not
be
too
fond
,
and
make
him
indifferent
:
<EOS>
but
yet
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
you
be
always
fond
of
one
another
,
and
never
indifferent
,
let
the
world
run
as
it
would
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
return
,
he
say
,
He
have
have
a
pleasant
ride
,
and
be
lead
out
to
a
great
distance
than
he
intend
.
 
<EOS>
at
supper
he
tell
me
,
that
he
have
a
great
mind
Mr.
Williams
should
marry
us
;
because
,
he
say
,
it
would
shew
a
thorough
reconciliation
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
most
generously
,
I
be
apprehensive
,
from
what
pass
between
you
,
that
the
poor
man
will
take
it
hardly
,
and
as
a
sort
of
insult
,
which
I
be
not
capable
of
.
 
<EOS>
what
say
my
girl
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
he
would
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
sir
,
say
I
:
<EOS>
as
to
what
he
may
think
,
I
can
not
answer
;
but
as
to
any
reason
for
his
thought
,
I
can
:
<EOS>
for
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
have
be
already
so
generous
,
that
he
can
not
,
I
think
,
mistake
your
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
speak
with
some
resentment
of
Lady
Davers
's
behaviour
,
and
I
ask
,
if
any
thing
new
have
occur
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
he
;
I
have
have
a
letter
deliver
me
from
her
impertinent
husband
,
professedly
at
her
instigation
,
that
amount
to
little
less
than
a
piece
of
insolent
bravery
,
on
supposing
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
marry
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
provoke
,
add
he
,
that
after
I
have
read
it
,
I
tear
it
in
a
hundred
piece
,
and
scatter
them
in
the
air
,
and
bid
the
man
who
bring
it
let
his
master
know
what
I
have
do
with
his
letter
;
and
so
would
not
permit
him
to
speak
to
me
,
as
he
would
fain
have
do
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
fellow
talk
somewhat
of
his
lady
come
hither
;
but
she
shall
not
set
her
foot
within
my
door
;
and
I
suppose
this
treatment
will
hinder
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
concerned
at
this
:
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
have
I
a
hundred
sister
,
Pamela
,
their
opposition
should
have
no
weight
with
me
:
and
I
do
not
intend
you
should
know
it
;
but
you
can
not
but
expect
a
little
difficulty
from
the
pride
of
my
sister
,
who
have
suffer
so
much
from
that
of
her
brother
;
and
we
be
too
nearly
ally
in
mind
,
as
well
as
blood
,
I
find
.
  
<EOS>
b
ut
<EOS>
this
be
not
her
business
:
<EOS>
and
if
she
would
have
make
it
so
,
she
should
have
do
it
with
more
decency
.
 
<EOS>
little
occasion
have
she
to
boast
of
her
birth
,
that
know
not
what
belong
to
good
manner
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
very
sorry
,
sir
,
to
be
the
unhappy
occasion
of
a
misunderstanding
between
so
good
a
brother
and
so
worthy
a
sister
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
say
so
,
Pamela
,
because
this
be
an
unavoidable
consequence
of
the
happy
prospect
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
only
bear
it
well
yourself
,
because
she
be
my
sister
;
and
leave
it
to
me
to
make
her
sensible
of
her
own
rashness
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
sir
,
say
I
,
the
most
lowly
behaviour
,
and
humble
deportment
,
and
in
every
thing
shew
a
dutiful
regard
to
good
Lady
Davers
,
will
have
any
weight
with
her
ladyship
,
assure
yourself
of
all
in
my
power
to
mollify
her
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
Pamela
,
return
he
<EOS>
;
do
not
imagine
,
when
you
be
my
wife
,
I
will
suffer
you
to
do
any
thing
unworthy
of
that
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
duty
of
a
husband
,
and
will
protect
your
gentleness
to
the
utmost
,
as
much
as
if
you
be
a
princess
by
descent
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
inexpressibly
good
,
sir
,
say
I
;
but
I
be
far
from
take
a
gentle
disposition
to
shew
a
meanness
of
spirit
:
<EOS>
and
this
be
a
trial
I
ought
to
expect
;
and
well
I
may
bear
it
,
that
have
so
many
benefit
to
set
against
it
,
which
all
spring
from
the
same
cause
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
all
the
matter
shall
be
this
<EOS>
:
We
will
talk
of
our
marriage
as
a
thing
to
be
do
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
have
spy
upon
me
wherever
I
go
,
and
whatever
I
do
:
<EOS>
but
now
,
I
be
on
so
laudable
a
pursuit
,
that
I
value
them
not
,
nor
those
who
employ
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
order
my
servant
to
have
no
conference
with
any
body
for
ten
or
twelve
day
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
tell
me
every
one
name
Thursday
come
se'nnight
for
our
nuptial
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
get
Mr.
Peters
,
who
want
to
see
my
little
chapel
,
to
assist
Mr.
Williams
,
under
the
notion
of
breakfast
with
me
next
Thursday
morning
,
since
you
will
not
have
it
sooner
;
and
there
will
nobody
else
be
want
;
and
I
will
beg
of
Mr.
Peters
to
keep
it
private
,
even
from
his
own
family
,
for
a
few
day
.
 
<EOS>
have
my
girl
any
objection
?
  
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
answer
I
,
you
be
so
generous
in
all
your
way
,
I
can
have
no
objection
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
Lady
Davers
and
you
will
not
proceed
to
irreconcilable
length
;
and
when
her
ladyship
come
to
see
you
,
and
to
tarry
with
you
,
two
or
three
week
,
as
she
use
to
do
,
I
will
keep
close
up
,
so
as
not
to
disgust
her
with
the
sight
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
we
will
talk
of
that
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
do
then
as
I
shall
think
fit
:
<EOS>
and
I
shall
be
able
to
judge
what
both
you
and
I
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
still
aggravate
the
matter
be
,
that
she
should
instigate
the
title
ape
her
husband
to
write
to
me
,
after
she
have
so
little
succeed
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
keep
his
letter
,
that
I
may
have
shew
you
how
a
man
,
that
generally
act
like
a
fool
,
can
take
upon
him
to
write
like
a
lord
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
it
be
of
my
sister
's
penning
,
and
he
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
be
the
humble
copier
.
  
<EOS>
Tuesday
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Thomas
be
return
from
you
,
my
dear
father
,
with
the
good
news
of
your
health
,
and
your
proceeding
in
your
journey
to
my
dear
mother
,
where
I
hope
to
hear
soon
you
be
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
have
just
now
be
make
me
play
upon
the
spinnet
,
and
sing
to
it
;
and
be
pleased
to
commend
me
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
so
for
every
thing
I
do
<EOS>
,
so
partial
do
his
goodness
make
him
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
one
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
just
return
from
an
airing
in
the
chariot
;
and
I
have
be
delight
with
his
conversation
upon
english
author
,
poet
particularly
.
<EOS>
He
entertain
me
also
with
a
description
of
some
of
the
curiosity
he
have
see
in
Italy
and
France
,
when
he
make
what
the
polite
world
call
the
grand
tour
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
want
to
be
at
his
other
seat
,
for
he
know
not
well
how
to
employ
himself
here
,
have
not
propose
to
stay
half
the
time
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
get
there
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
you
will
hardly
be
trouble
with
so
much
of
my
company
,
after
we
have
settle
;
for
I
have
a
great
many
thing
to
adjust
:
<EOS>
and
I
must
go
to
London
;
<EOS>
for
I
have
account
that
have
run
on
longer
than
ordinary
with
my
banker
there
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
know
,
add
he
,
but
the
ensue
winter
I
may
give
you
a
little
taste
of
the
diversion
of
the
town
for
a
month
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
His
will
and
pleasure
should
determine
mine
;
and
I
never
would
,
as
near
as
I
could
,
have
a
desire
after
those
,
or
any
other
entertainment
that
be
not
in
his
own
choice
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
<EOS>
that
I
shall
be
very
happy
in
you
;
and
hope
you
will
be
so
in
me
:
for
,
say
he
,
I
have
no
very
enormous
vice
to
gratify
;
though
I
pretend
not
to
the
great
purity
,
neither
,
my
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
if
you
can
account
to
your
own
mind
,
I
shall
always
be
easy
in
whatever
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
our
great
happiness
here
,
sir
,
continue
I
,
<EOS>
be
of
very
short
duration
;
and
this
life
,
at
the
long
,
be
a
poor
transitory
one
;
and
I
hope
we
shall
be
so
happy
as
to
be
enable
to
look
forward
,
with
comfort
,
to
another
,
where
our
pleasure
will
be
everlasting
.
  
<EOS>
You
say
well
,
Pamela
;
and
I
shall
,
by
degree
,
be
more
habituated
to
this
way
of
thinking
,
as
I
more
and
more
converse
with
you
;
but
,
at
present
,
you
must
not
be
over
serious
with
me
all
at
once
:
though
I
charge
you
never
forbear
to
mingle
your
sweet
divinity
in
our
conversation
,
whenever
it
can
be
bring
in
a
propos
,
and
with
such
a
cheerfulness
of
temper
,
as
shall
not
throw
a
gloomy
cloud
over
our
innocent
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
abash
at
this
,
and
silent
,
fear
I
have
offend
:
<EOS>
but
he
say
,
if
you
attend
rightly
to
what
I
say
,
I
need
not
tell
you
again
,
Pamela
,
not
to
be
discourage
from
suggest
to
me
,
on
every
proper
occasion
,
the
pious
impulse
of
your
own
amiable
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
will
be
always
indulgent
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
to
my
imperfection
,
so
long
as
I
mean
well
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
make
me
dine
with
him
,
and
would
eat
nothing
but
what
I
help
him
to
;
and
my
heart
be
,
every
hour
,
more
and
more
enlarged
with
his
goodness
and
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
,
what
ail
me
,
I
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
a
strange
sort
of
weight
hang
upon
my
mind
,
as
Thursday
draw
on
,
which
make
me
often
sigh
involuntarily
,
and
damp
,
at
time
,
the
pleasure
of
my
delightful
prospect
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
this
be
not
ominous
;
but
only
the
foolish
weakness
of
an
over
-
thoughtful
mind
,
on
an
occasion
the
most
solemn
and
important
of
one
's
life
,
next
to
the
last
scene
,
which
shut
up
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
be
very
serious
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
commit
all
my
way
to
that
bless
Providence
,
which
hitherto
have
so
wonderfully
conduct
me
through
real
evil
to
this
hopeful
situation
.
  
<EOS>
I
only
fear
,
and
surely
I
have
great
reason
,
that
I
shall
be
too
unworthy
to
hold
the
affection
of
so
dear
a
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
God
teach
me
humility
,
and
to
know
my
own
demerit
!
 
<EOS>
and
this
will
be
,
<EOS>
next
to
his
grace
,
my
sure
guard
,
in
the
state
of
life
to
which
,
though
most
unworthy
,
I
be
go
to
be
exalt
.
 
<EOS>
and
do
not
cease
your
prayer
for
me
,
my
dear
parent
;
for
,
perhaps
,
this
new
condition
may
be
subject
to
still
bad
hazard
than
those
I
have
escape
;
as
would
be
the
case
,
be
conceitedness
,
vanity
,
and
pride
,
to
take
hold
of
my
frail
heart
;
and
if
I
be
,
for
my
sin
,
to
be
leave
to
my
own
conduct
,
a
frail
bark
in
a
tempestuous
ocean
,
without
ballast
,
or
other
pilot
than
my
own
inconsiderate
will
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
master
say
,
on
another
occasion
,
that
those
who
doubt
most
,
always
err
least
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
always
doubt
my
own
strength
,
my
own
worthiness
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
twenty
sweet
agreeable
thing
that
pass
in
conversation
with
my
excellent
benefactor
;
nor
with
the
civility
of
M.
Colbrand
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
all
the
servant
,
who
seem
to
be
highly
pleased
with
me
,
and
with
my
conduct
to
them
:
<EOS>
and
as
my
master
,
hitherto
,
find
no
fault
that
I
go
too
low
,
nor
they
that
I
carry
it
too
high
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
shall
continue
to
have
every
body
's
good
-
will
:
but
yet
will
I
not
seek
to
gain
any
one
's
by
little
meanness
or
debasement
!
<EOS>
but
aim
at
an
uniform
and
regular
conduct
,
willing
to
conceal
involuntary
error
,
as
I
would
have
my
own
forgiven
;
and
not
too
industrious
to
discover
real
one
,
or
to
hide
such
,
if
any
such
should
appear
,
as
may
encourage
bad
heart
,
or
unclean
hand
,
in
material
case
,
where
my
master
should
receive
damage
,
or
where
the
moral
of
the
transgressor
should
appear
wilfully
and
habitually
corrupt
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
will
endeavour
,
as
much
as
I
can
,
that
good
servant
shall
find
in
me
a
kind
encourager
;
indifferent
one
be
make
well
,
by
inspire
them
with
a
laudable
emulation
;
and
bad
one
,
if
not
too
bad
in
nature
,
and
quite
irreclaimable
,
reform
by
kindness
,
expostulation
,
and
even
proper
menace
,
if
necessary
;
but
most
by
a
good
example
:
all
this
if
God
please
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
parent
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
this
one
day
between
me
and
the
most
solemn
rite
that
can
be
perform
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
can
not
yet
shake
off
this
heavy
weight
.
 
<EOS>
sure
I
be
ungrateful
to
the
divine
goodness
,
and
the
favour
of
the
good
of
benefactor
!
 
<EOS>
yet
I
hope
I
be
not
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
at
time
,
my
mind
be
all
exultation
,
with
the
prospect
of
what
good
to
-
morrow
's
happy
solemnity
may
possibly
,
by
the
leave
of
my
generous
master
,
put
it
in
my
power
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
shall
I
find
word
to
express
,
as
I
ought
,
<EOS>
my
thankfulness
,
for
all
the
mercy
before
me
!
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
master
be
all
love
and
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
my
weakness
,
and
generously
pity
and
comfort
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
to
be
excuse
supper
;
but
he
bring
me
down
himself
from
my
closet
,
and
place
me
by
him
,
bid
Abraham
not
wait
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
eat
,
and
<EOS>
yet
I
try
,
for
fear
he
should
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
He
kindly
forbear
to
hint
any
thing
of
the
dreadful
,
yet
delightful
to
-
morrow
!
<EOS>
and
put
,
now
and
then
,
a
little
bit
on
my
plate
,
and
guide
it
to
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
concerned
to
receive
his
goodness
with
so
ill
a
grace
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
if
you
will
not
eat
with
me
,
drink
at
least
with
me
:
I
drink
two
glass
by
his
over
-
persuasion
,
and
say
,
I
be
really
ashamed
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
,
say
he
,
my
dear
girl
,
I
be
not
a
very
dreadful
enemy
,
I
hope
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
any
thing
that
be
the
least
concern
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
all
be
owe
to
the
sense
I
have
of
my
own
unworthiness
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
it
can
not
be
any
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
He
ring
for
the
thing
to
be
take
away
;
and
then
reach
a
chair
,
and
sit
down
by
me
,
and
put
his
kind
arm
about
me
,
and
say
the
most
generous
and
affect
thing
that
ever
dropt
from
the
honey
-
flow
mouth
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
have
not
time
to
repeat
:
some
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
and
oh
!
indulge
your
foolish
daughter
,
who
trouble
you
with
her
weak
nonsense
;
because
what
she
have
to
say
,
be
so
affect
to
her
;
and
because
,
if
she
go
to
bed
,
instead
of
scribble
,
she
could
not
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
this
sweet
confusion
and
thoughtfulness
in
my
beloved
Pamela
,
say
the
kind
man
,
on
the
near
approach
of
our
happy
union
,
when
I
hope
all
doubt
be
clear
up
,
and
nothing
of
dishonour
be
apprehend
,
shew
me
most
abundantly
,
what
a
wretch
I
be
to
attempt
such
purity
with
a
bad
intention
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
,
that
one
so
virtuous
should
find
herself
desert
of
life
itself
on
a
violence
so
dreadful
to
her
honour
,
and
seek
a
refuge
in
the
shadow
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
that
you
have
see
a
purity
on
my
side
,
as
nearly
imitate
your
own
,
as
our
sex
can
shew
to
yours
;
and
since
I
have
,
all
the
day
long
,
suppress
even
the
least
intimation
of
the
come
day
,
that
I
may
not
alarm
your
tender
mind
;
why
all
this
concern
,
why
all
this
affect
,
yet
sweet
confusion
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
generous
friend
,
my
dear
girl
,
in
me
;
a
protector
now
,
not
a
violator
of
your
innocence
:
why
then
,
once
more
I
ask
,
this
strange
perplexity
,
this
sweet
confusion
?
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
and
hide
my
face
on
his
arm
;
expect
not
reason
from
a
foolish
creature
:
You
should
have
still
indulge
me
in
my
closet
:
I
be
ready
to
beat
myself
for
this
ungrateful
return
to
your
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
not
what
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
to
be
sure
,
a
silly
creature
!
 
<EOS>
o
have
you
but
suffer
me
to
stay
by
myself
above
,
I
should
have
make
myself
ashamed
of
so
culpable
a
behaviour
!
 
<EOS>
but
goodness
add
to
goodness
every
moment
,
and
the
sense
of
my
own
unworthiness
,
quite
overcome
my
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
say
the
generous
man
,
will
I
,
though
reluctantly
,
make
a
proposal
to
my
sweet
girl
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
too
press
for
the
day
:
if
another
day
will
still
be
more
obliging
:
if
you
have
fear
you
will
not
then
have
;
you
shall
say
but
the
word
,
and
I
will
submit
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
Pamela
;
for
though
I
have
,
these
three
day
past
,
think
every
tedious
hour
a
day
,
till
Thursday
come
,
if
you
earnestly
desire
it
,
I
will
postpone
it
.
<EOS>
say
,
my
dear
girl
,
freely
say
;
but
accept
not
my
proposal
,
without
great
reason
,
which
yet
I
will
not
ask
for
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
can
expect
nothing
but
superlative
goodness
,
I
have
be
so
long
use
to
it
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
most
generous
instance
of
it
;
but
I
fear
 
yes
,
I
fear
it
will
be
too
much
the
same
thing
,
<EOS>
some
day
hence
,
when
the
happy
,
yet
,
fool
that
I
be
!
<EOS>
dreaded
time
,
shall
be
equally
near
!
  
<EOS>
kind
,
lovely
charmer
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
now
do
I
see
you
be
to
be
trust
with
power
,
from
the
generous
use
you
make
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
not
one
offensive
word
or
look
,
from
me
,
shall
wound
your
nice
thought
;
but
pray
try
to
subdue
this
over
-
scrupulousness
,
and
unseasonable
timidity
.
 
<EOS>
I
persuade
myself
you
will
if
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
I
will
,
say
I
;
for
I
be
quite
ashamed
of
myself
,
with
all
these
lovely
view
before
me
!
 
<EOS>
the
honour
you
do
me
,
the
kindness
you
shew
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
forgive
myself
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
know
the
least
of
this
idle
foolish
heart
of
mine
,
it
have
not
a
misgive
thought
of
your
goodness
;
and
I
should
abhor
it
,
if
it
be
capable
of
the
least
affectation
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
dear
good
sir
,
leave
me
a
little
to
myself
,
and
I
will
take
myself
to
a
severer
task
than
your
goodness
will
let
you
do
<EOS>
and
I
will
present
my
heart
before
you
,
a
worthy
offering
to
you
,
<EOS>
than
at
present
its
wayward
folly
will
let
it
seem
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
thing
be
,
one
have
no
kind
friend
of
one
's
own
sex
,
to
communicate
one
's
foolish
thought
to
,
and
to
be
strengthen
by
their
comforting
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
leave
to
myself
;
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
weak
silly
thing
I
be
!
  
<EOS>
He
kindly
withdraw
,
to
give
me
time
to
recollect
myself
;
and
in
about
half
an
hour
return
:
and
then
,
that
he
may
not
begin
at
once
upon
the
subject
,
and
say
,
at
the
same
time
,
something
agreeable
to
me
,
say
,
Your
father
and
mother
have
have
a
great
deal
of
talk
by
this
time
about
you
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
return
I
,
your
goodness
have
make
them
quite
happy
!
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
help
be
concerned
about
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
be
vexed
<EOS>
I
do
not
hear
the
footman
out
;
because
it
run
in
my
head
he
talk
somewhat
about
her
come
hither
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
meet
with
but
an
indifferent
reception
from
me
,
unless
she
come
resolve
to
behave
well
than
she
write
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
say
I
,
be
pleased
to
bear
with
my
good
lady
,
for
two
reason
.
<EOS>
what
be
they
?
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
first
,
sir
,
answer
I
,
because
she
be
your
sister
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
may
very
well
think
,
what
all
the
world
will
,
that
you
have
much
undervalue
yourself
in
make
me
happy
.
 
<EOS>
and
next
,
because
,
if
her
ladyship
find
you
out
of
temper
with
her
,
it
will
still
aggravate
her
more
against
me
;
and
every
time
that
any
warm
word
you
may
have
between
you
,
come
into
her
mind
,
she
will
disdain
me
more
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
concern
yourself
about
it
,
say
he
;
for
we
have
more
proud
lady
than
she
in
our
other
neighbourhood
,
who
,
perhaps
,
have
still
less
reason
to
be
punctilious
about
their
descent
,
and
yet
will
form
themselves
upon
her
example
,
and
say
,
why
,
his
own
sister
will
not
forgive
him
,
nor
visit
him
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
if
I
can
subdue
her
spirit
,
which
be
more
than
her
husband
ever
could
,
or
indeed
any
body
else
,
it
be
a
great
point
gain
:
<EOS>
and
,
if
she
give
me
reason
,
I
will
try
for
it
,
I
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
my
dear
girl
,
continue
he
,
since
the
subject
be
so
important
,
may
I
not
say
one
word
about
to
-
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
less
a
fool
:
I
have
talk
as
harshly
to
my
heart
,
as
Lady
Davers
can
do
;
and
the
naughty
thing
suggest
to
me
a
well
,
and
more
grateful
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
,
kiss
me
,
say
,
I
take
notice
,
Pamela
,
of
what
you
observe
,
that
you
have
none
of
your
own
sex
with
you
;
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
a
little
hard
upon
you
;
and
I
should
have
like
you
should
have
have
Miss
Darnford
;
but
then
her
sister
must
have
be
ask
;
and
I
may
as
well
make
a
public
wedding
:
which
,
you
know
,
would
have
require
clothe
and
other
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
add
he
,
a
foolish
proposal
be
once
make
me
of
that
second
sister
,
who
have
two
or
three
thousand
pound
more
than
the
other
,
leave
her
by
a
godmother
,
and
she
can
not
help
be
a
little
piqued
<EOS>
;
though
,
say
he
,
it
be
a
proposal
they
could
not
expect
should
succeed
;
for
there
be
nothing
in
her
person
nor
mind
;
and
her
fortune
,
as
that
must
have
be
the
only
inducement
,
would
not
do
by
any
mean
;
and
so
I
discourage
it
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
think
,
sir
,
say
I
,
of
another
mortifying
thing
too
;
that
be
you
to
marry
a
lady
of
birth
and
fortune
answerable
to
your
own
,
all
the
eve
to
the
day
would
be
take
up
in
reading
,
signing
,
and
sealing
of
settlement
,
and
portion
,
and
such
like
:
<EOS>
but
now
the
poor
Pamela
bring
you
nothing
at
all
:
<EOS>
and
the
very
clothe
she
wear
,
so
very
low
be
she
,
be
entirely
the
effect
of
your
bounty
,
and
that
of
your
good
mother
<EOS>
:
this
make
me
a
little
sad
:
<EOS>
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
I
be
so
much
oppress
by
your
favour
,
and
the
sense
of
the
obligation
I
lie
under
,
that
I
can
not
look
up
with
the
confidence
that
I
otherwise
should
,
on
this
awful
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
he
,
where
the
power
be
want
,
as
much
generosity
in
the
will
as
in
the
action
.
 
<EOS>
to
all
that
know
your
story
,
and
your
merit
,
it
will
appear
that
I
can
not
recompense
you
for
what
I
have
make
you
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
have
too
many
hard
struggle
and
exercise
;
and
have
nobly
overcome
:
and
who
shall
grudge
you
the
reward
of
the
hard
-
buy
victory
?
 
<EOS>
this
affair
be
so
much
the
act
of
my
own
will
,
that
I
glory
in
be
capable
of
distinguish
so
much
excellence
;
and
my
fortune
be
the
more
pleasurable
to
me
,
as
it
give
me
hope
,
that
I
may
make
you
some
part
of
satisfaction
for
what
you
have
undergo
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
sir
,
say
I
,
be
all
goodness
,
unmerite
on
my
side
;
and
make
my
obligation
the
great
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
wish
for
more
worthiness
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
poor
be
it
to
offer
nothing
but
word
for
such
generous
deed
!
 
<EOS>
and
to
say
,
I
wish
!
 
<EOS>
for
what
be
a
wish
,
but
the
acknowledge
want
of
power
to
oblige
,
and
a
demonstration
of
one
's
poverty
in
every
thing
but
will
?
  
<EOS>
and
that
,
my
dear
girl
,
say
he
,
be
every
thing
:
'
<EOS>
Tis
all
I
want
:
'
<EOS>
tis
all
that
Heaven
itself
require
of
us
:
<EOS>
but
no
more
of
these
little
doubt
,
though
they
be
the
natural
impulse
of
a
generous
and
grateful
heart
:
I
want
not
to
be
employ
in
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
those
be
for
such
to
regard
,
who
make
convenience
and
fortune
the
prime
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
possession
ample
enough
for
us
both
;
and
you
deserve
to
share
them
with
me
;
and
you
shall
do
it
,
with
as
little
reserve
,
as
if
you
have
bring
me
what
the
world
reckon
an
equivalent
:
<EOS>
for
,
as
to
my
own
opinion
,
you
bring
me
what
be
infinitely
more
valuable
,
an
experienced
truth
,
a
well
-
try
virtue
,
and
a
wit
and
behaviour
more
than
equal
to
the
station
you
will
be
place
in
:
<EOS>
to
say
nothing
of
this
sweet
person
,
that
itself
may
captivate
a
monarch
;
and
of
the
meekness
of
temper
,
and
sweetness
of
disposition
,
which
make
you
superior
to
all
the
woman
I
ever
see
.
  
<EOS>
thus
kind
and
soothing
,
and
honourably
affectionate
,
be
the
dear
gentleman
,
to
the
unworthy
,
doubting
,
yet
assure
Pamela
;
and
thus
patiently
do
he
indulge
,
and
generously
pardon
,
my
impertinent
weakness
.
<EOS>
He
offer
to
go
himself
to
Lady
Jones
,
in
the
morning
,
and
reveal
the
matter
to
her
,
and
desire
her
secrecy
and
presence
;
but
I
say
,
that
would
disoblige
the
young
Ladies
Darnford
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
will
cast
myself
upon
your
generous
kindness
;
for
why
should
I
fear
the
kind
protector
of
my
weakness
,
and
the
guide
and
director
of
my
future
step
?
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
,
say
he
,
forgive
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
for
she
must
know
it
;
and
suffer
her
to
be
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
civil
to
me
now
:
and
her
former
wickedness
I
will
forgive
,
for
the
sake
of
the
happy
fruit
that
have
attend
it
;
and
because
you
mention
her
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
I
will
call
her
in
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
as
you
please
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
<EOS>
and
he
ring
for
her
;
and
when
she
come
in
,
he
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
be
go
to
entrust
you
with
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
answer
she
,
I
will
be
sure
to
keep
it
as
such
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
<EOS>
,
we
intend
to
-
morrow
,
privately
as
possible
,
for
our
wedding
-
day
;
and
Mr.
Peters
and
Mr.
Williams
be
to
be
here
,
as
to
breakfast
with
me
,
and
to
shew
Mr.
Peters
my
little
chapel
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
be
over
,
we
will
take
a
little
airing
in
the
chariot
,
as
we
have
do
at
other
time
;
and
so
it
will
not
be
wonder
that
we
be
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
two
parson
have
promise
secrecy
,
and
will
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
can
not
well
avoid
let
one
of
the
maid
into
the
secret
;
but
that
I
will
leave
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir

reply
she
<EOS>
,
we
all
conclude
it
would
be
in
a
few
day
!
<EOS>
and
I
doubt
it
will
not
be
long
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
he
,
I
do
not
desire
it
should
;
but
you
know
we
be
not
provide
for
a
public
wedding
,
and
I
shall
declare
it
when
we
go
to
Bedfordshire
,
which
will
not
be
long
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
man
,
who
lie
in
the
outhouse
,
need
not
know
it
;
for
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
my
sister
Davers
know
all
that
pass
.
  
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
sir
,
say
she
,
that
her
ladyship
intend
to
be
down
here
with
you
in
a
few
day
?
 
<EOS>
Her
servant

me
so
,
who
bring
you
the
letter
you
be
angry
at
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
say
he
,
we
shall
be
set
out
for
t'other
house
first
;
and
shall
be
please
she
lose
her
labour
.
 
<EOS>
Sir

continue

,
her
ladyship
,
propose
to
be
here
time
enough
to
hinder
your
nuptial
,
which
she
take
,
as
we
do
,
will
be
the
latter
end
of
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
let
her
come
:
<EOS>
but
yet
I
desire
not
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
to
me
,
give
me
leave
,
madam
,
to
wish
you
all
manner
of
happiness
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
I
have
too
well
obey
his
honour
,
to
be
forgive
by
you
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
return
I
,
you
will
be
more
your
own
enemy
than
I
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
look
all
forward
:
and
shall
not
presume
,
so
much
as
by
a
whisper
,
to
set
my
good
master
against
any
one
he
please
to
approve
of
:
<EOS>
and
as
to
his
old
servant
,
I
shall
always
value
them
,
and
never
offer
to
dictate
to
his
choice
,
or
influence
it
by
my
own
caprice
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
my
master
,
you
find
you
have
no
cause
to
apprehend
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
My
Pamela
be
very
placable
;
and
as
we
have
both
be
sinner
together
,
we
must
both
be
include
in
one
act
of
grace
.
  
<EOS>
such
an
example
of
condescension
,
as
I
have
before
me
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
I
,
may
make
you
very
easy
;
for
I
must
be
highly
unworthy
,
if
I
do
not
forego
all
my
little
resentment
,
if
I
have
any
,
for
the
sake
of
so
much
goodness
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
very
kind
,
madam
,
say
she
;
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
I
will
atone
for
all
my
fault
,
by
my
future
duty
and
respect
to
you
,
as
well
as
to
my
master
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
well
say
on
both
side
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
but
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
assure
you
,
that
my
good
girl
here
have
no
malice
,
she
choose
you
to
attend
her
in
the
morning
at
the
ceremony
,
and
you
must
keep
up
her
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
reply
she
,
be
very
proud
of
the
honour
:
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
,
madam
,
but
wonder
to
see
you
so
very
low
-
spirited
,
as
you
have
be
these
two
or
three
day
past
,
with
so
much
happiness
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
answer
I
,
there
can
be
but
one
reason
give
;
and
that
is
,
that
I
be
a
sad
fool
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
I
be
not
ungrateful
neither
;
nor
would
I
put
on
a
foolish
affectation
:
<EOS>
but
my
heart
,
at
time
,
sink
within
me
;
I
know
not
why
,
except
at
my
own
unworthiness
,
and
because
the
honour
do
me
be
too
high
for
me
to
support
myself
under
,
as
I
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
honour
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
add
I
,
<EOS>
I
be
not
bear
to
;
and
no
wonder
,
then
,
I
behave
so
awkwardly
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
me
a
fine
compliment
upon
it
,
and
withdraw
,
repeat
her
promise
of
care
,
secrecy
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
He
part
from
me
with
very
great
tenderness
;
and
I
come
up
and
set
to
writing
,
to
amuse
my
thought
,
and
write
thus
far
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
come
up
,
and
<EOS>
it
be
past
twelve
,
I
will
go
to
bed
;
but
not
one
wink
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
shall
I
get
this
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
beat
myself
for
anger
.
 
<EOS>
sure
there
be
nothing
ominous
in
this
strange
folly
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
all
young
maiden
be
the
same
,
so
near
so
great
a
change
of
condition
,
though
they
carry
it
off
more
discreetly
than
I.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
,
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
have
not
go
to
bed
last
night
,
for
what
sleep
I
have
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
often
be
talk
to
me
,
and
say
several
thing
that
would
have
be
well
enough
from
any
body
else
of
our
sex
;
but
the
poor
woman
have
so
little
purity
of
heart
,
that
it
be
all
say
from
her
,
and
go
no
farther
than
the
ear
.
  
<EOS>
I
fancy
my
master
have
not
sleep
much
neither
;
for
I
hear
him
up
,
and
walk
about
his
chamber
,
ever
since
break
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
good
gentleman
!
<EOS>
he
must
have
some
concern
,
as
well
as
I
;
for
here
he
be
go
to
marry
a
poor
foolish
unworthy
girl
,
bring
up
on
the
charity
,
as
one
may
say
,
(
at
least
bounty
,
)
of
his
worthy
family
!
 
<EOS>
and
this
foolish
girl
must
be
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose
,
after
twelve
o'clock
this
day
,
as
much
his
wife
,
as
if
he
be
to
marry
a
duchess
!
 
<EOS>
and
here
he
must
stand
the
shock
of
common
reflection
!
 
<EOS>
the
great
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
have
do
finely
!
<EOS>
he
have
marry
his
poor
servant
wench
!
<EOS>
will
some
say
.
 
<EOS>
the
ridicule
and
rude
jest
of
his
equal
,
and
companion
too
<EOS>
,
he
must
stand
:
<EOS>
and
the
disdain
of
his
relation
,
and
indignation
of
Lady
Davers
,
his
lofty
sister
!
 
<EOS>
dear
good
gentleman
!
<EOS>
he
will
have
enough
to
do
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
o
how
shall
I
merit
all
these
thing
at
his
hand
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
do
the
good
I
can
;
and
pray
to
God
to
reward
him
;
and
resolve
to
love
him
with
a
pure
heart
,
and
serve
him
with
a
sincere
obedience
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
dear
gentleman
will
continue
to
love
me
for
this
;
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
else
to
offer
!
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
can
hardly
expect
so
great
a
blessing
,
if
I
can
be
secure
from
his
contempt
,
I
shall
not
be
unfortunate
;
and
must
bear
his
indifference
,
if
his
rich
friend
should
inspire
him
with
it
,
and
proceed
with
do
my
duty
with
cheerfulness
.
  
<EOS>
half
an

past
eight
o'clock

My

<EOS>
He

it
should
affect

<EOS>
:
I

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
but
I

the
want
of
the
presence
and
comforting
of
a

mother
,
of
a
love
sister
,
or
of
the
kind
companion
of

up
to
you
without
that
sweet
terror
,
that
must
confound
poor
bashful
maidens
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
when
they
be
surrender
up
to
a
more
doubtful
happiness
,
and
to
half
-
strange
man
,
whose
good
faith
,
and
good
usage
of
them
,
must
be
less
experienced
,
and
be
all
involve
in
the
dark
bosom
of
futurity
,
and
only
to
be
prove
by
the
event
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
he
,
be
most
kindly
say
!
 
<EOS>
It
shew
me
that
you
enter
gratefully
into
my
intention
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
would
,
by
my
conduct
,
supply
all
these
dear
relation
to
you
;
and
I
voluntarily
promise
,
from
my
heart
,
to
you
,
what
I
think
I
could
not
,
with
such
assured
resolution
of
performance
,
to
the
highest
-
bear
lady
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
for
let
me
tell
my
sweet
girl
,
that
,
after
have
be
long
toss
by
the
boisterous
wind
of
a
more
culpable
passion
,
I
have
now
conquer
it
,
and
be
not
so
much
the
victim
of
your
beauty
,
all
charming
as
you
be
,
as
of
your
virtue
;
and
therefore
may
more
boldly
promise
for
myself
,
have
so
stable
a
foundation
for
my
affection
;
which
,
should
this
outward
beauty
fail
,
will
increase
with
your
virtue
,
and
shine
forth
the
bright
,
as
that
be
more
illustriously
display
by
the
augment
opportunity
which
the
condition
you
be
now
enter
into
will
afford
you
.
 
<EOS>
o
the
dear
charming
man
!
<EOS>
how
nobly
,
how
encouragingly
kind
,
be
all
this
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
suitably
express
myself
:
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
<EOS>
I
see
my
girl
be
at
a
loss
for
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
your
kind
acceptance
of
my
declaration
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
act
too
much
the
part
of
a
libertine
formerly
,
for
you
to
look
back
without
some
anxiety
,
I
ought
not
,
be
now
happily
convict
,
to
say
less
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
lose
my
girl
her
time
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
now
only
add
,
that
I
hope
for
many
happy
year
to
make
good
,
by
my
conduct
,
what
so
willingly
flow
from
my
lip
.
  
<EOS>
He
kiss
me
again
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
you
do
,
Pamela
,
be
cheerful
;
for
else
,
may
be
,
of
the
small
company
we
shall
have
,
some
one
,
not
know
how
to
account
for
your
too
nice
modesty
,
will
think
there
be
some
other
person
in
the
world
,
whose
address
would
be
still
more
agreeable
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
this
he
say
with
an
air
of
sweetness
and
pleasantry
;
but
it
alarm
me
exceedingly
,
and
make
me
resolve
to
appear
as
calm
and
cheerful
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
be
,
indeed
,
a
most
affect
expression
,
and
enough
to
make
me
,
if
any
thing
can
,
behave
as
I
ought
,
and
to
force
my
idle
fear
to
give
way
to
hope
so
much
better
ground
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
begin
almost
,
on
this
occasion
,
to
wish
Mr.
Williams
be
not
to
marry
me
,
lest
I
should
behave
like
a
fool
;
and
so
be
liable
to
an
imputation
,
which
I
should
be
most
unworthy
,
if
I
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
set
about
dress
me
instantly
;
and
he
send
Mrs.
jewke
to
assist
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
never
long
a
dressing
,
when
I
set
about
it
;
and
my
master
have
now
give
me
a
hint
,
that
will
,
for
half
an
hour
more
,
at
least
,
keep
my
spirit
in
a
brisk
circulation
.
 
<EOS>
yet
it
concern
me
a
little
too
,
lest
he
should
have
any
the
least
shadow
of
a
doubt
,
that
I
be
not
,
mind
and
person
,
entirely
his
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
be
now
ready
,
and
not
call
to
breakfast
,
I
sit
down
and
write
thus
far
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
mention
,
that
I
dress
myself
in
a
rich
white
satin
night
-
gown
,
<EOS>
that
have
be
my
good
lady
's
,
and
my
good
head
-
clothe
,
etc
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
such
a
knack
of
writing
,
that
when
I
be
by
myself
,
I
can
not
sit
without
a
pen
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
now
call
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
gentleman
be
come
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
courage
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
remember
thou
art
upon
thy
good
behaviour
!
 
<EOS>
fie
upon
it
!
<EOS>
my
heart
begin
to
flutter
again
!
  
<EOS>
F
oolish
heart
!
<EOS>
be
still
!
 
<EOS>
never
,
sure
,
be
any
maiden
's
perverse
heart
under
so
little
command
as
mine
!
 
<EOS>
It
give
itself
away
,
at
first
,
without
my
leave
;
it
have
be
,
for
week
,
press
me
with
its
wish
;
and
yet
now
,
when
it
should
be
happy
itself
,
and
make
me
<EOS>
so
,
it
be
throb
,
throb
,
throb
,
like
a
little
fool
!
<EOS>
and
fill
me
with
such
unseasonable
misgiving
,
as
abate
the
rise
comfort
of
all
my
well
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
,
near
three
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
find
no
time
nor
heart
to
write
again
this
day
.
<EOS>
but
here
be
three
gentleman
come
,
unexpectedly
,
to
dine
with
my
master
;
and
so
I
shall
not
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
do
all
he
could
,
civilly
,
to
send
them
away
;
but
they
will
stay
,
though
I
believe
he
have
rather
they
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
<EOS>
to
write
till
I
go
to
dinner
myself
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
for
my
master
be
not
prepared
for
this
company
;
and
it
will
be
a
little
latish
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
will
begin
with
my
happy
story
where
I
leave
off
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
down
to
breakfast
,
Mr.
Peters
and
Mr.
Williams
be
both
there
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
my
master
hear
me
come
down
,
he
meet
me
at
the
door
,
and
lead
me
in
with
great
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
kindly
speak
to
them
,
as
he
tell
me
afterwards
,
to
mention
no
more
of
the
matter
to
me
,
than
need
must
.
 
<EOS>
I
pay
my
respect
to
them
,
I
believe
a
little
awkwardly
,
and
be
almost
out
of
breath
:
but
say
,
I
have
come
down
a
little
too
fast
.
  
<EOS>
when
Abraham
come
in
to
wait
,
my
master
say
,
(
that
the
servant
should
not
mistrust
,
)
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
,
gentleman
,
you
come
as
you
do
;
for
my
good
girl
<EOS>
and
I
be
go
to
take
an
airing
till
dinner
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
stay
and
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
Mr.
Peters
,
we
will
not
hinder
your
airing
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
come
,
have
a
little
time
upon
my
hand
,
to
see
your
chapel
;
but
must
be
at
home
at
dinner
;
and
Mr.
Williams
will
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
say
my
master
,
we
will
pursue
our
intention
,
and
ride
out
for
an
hour
or
two
,
as
soon
as
I
have
shew
Mr.
Peters
my
little
chapel
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
,
Pamela
,
after
breakfast
,
walk
with
us
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
if
,
if
,
say
I
,
and
have
like
to
have
stammer
,
foolish
that
I
be
!
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
look
none
of
them
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
Abraham
look
at
me
;
why
,
child
,
say
my
master
,
you
have
hardly
recover
your
fright
yet
<EOS>
:
how
come
your
foot
to
slip
?
 
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
you
do
not
hurt
yourself
.
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Peters
,
improve
the
hint
,
You
ha'n't
sprain
your
ancle
,
madam
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
believe
not
;
but
'
tis
a
little
painful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
;
for
I
mean
my
foolishness
!
 
<EOS>
Abraham
,
say
my
master
,
bid
Robin
put
the
horse
to
the
coach
,
instead
of
the
chariot
;
and
if
these
gentleman
will
go
,
we
can
set
them
down
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
,
sir
,
say
Mr.
Peters
:
I
have
as
lieve
walk
,
if
Mr.
Williams
choose
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
then
,
say
my
master
,
let
it
be
the
chariot
,
as
I
tell
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
eat
nothing
,
though
I
attempt
it
;
and
my
hand
shake
so
<EOS>
,
I
spill
some
of
my
chocolate
,
and
so
put
it
down
again
;
and
they
be
all
very
good
,
and
look
another
way
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
say
,
when
Abraham
be
out
,
I
have
a
quite
plain
ring
here
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
the
ceremony
will
dignify
the
ring
;
and
that
I
shall
give
my
girl
reason
to
think
it
,
for
that
cause
,
the
most
valuable
one
that
can
be
present
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
say
,
He
be
sure
I
should
value
it
more
than
the
rich
diamond
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
bid
Mrs.
Jewkes
not
to
dress
herself
,
lest
she
should
give
cause
of
mistrust
;
and
she
take
my
advice
.
  
<EOS>
when
breakfast
be
over
,
my
master
say
,
before
Abraham
,
well
,
<EOS>
gentleman
,
we
will
step
into
the
chapel
;
and
you
must
give
me
your
advice
,
as
to
the
alteration
I
design
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
more
haste
,
because
the
survey
you
be
go
to
take
of
it
,
for
the
alteration
,
will
take
up
a
little
time
;
and
we
shall
have
but
a
small
space
between
that
and
dinner
,
for
the
little
tour
<EOS>
I
design
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
Pamela
,
you
will
give
us
your
opinion
,
will
not
you
?
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
I
;
I
will
come
after
you
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
go
out
,
and
I
sit
down
in
the
chair
again
,
and
fan
myself
:
<EOS>
I
be
sick
at
heart
,
say
I
,
I
think
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
Shall
I
fetch
you
a
little
cordial
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
I
,
I
be
a
sad
fool
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
spirit
,
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
her
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
would
have
give
it
me
:
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
keep
it
in
your
hand
;
may
be
I
shall
want
it
:
<EOS>
but
I
hope
not
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
very
good
word
,
and
beg
me
to
go
:
<EOS>
and
I
get
up
;
but
my
knee
beat
so
against
one
another
<EOS>
,
I
be
force
to
sit
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
at
last
,
I
hold
by
her
arm
,
and
pass
by
Abraham
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
this
ugly
slip
,
come
down
stair
,
have
make
me
limp
,
though
;
so
I
must
hold
by
you
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
what
alteration
there
be
to
be
in
the
chapel
,
that
we
must
all
give
our
opinion
of
them
?
  
<EOS>
Nan
,
she
tell
me
,
be
let
into
the
secret
;
and
she
have
order
her
to
stay
at
the
chapel
door
,
to
see
that
nobody
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
master
come
to
me
,
at
enter
the
chapel
,
and
take
my
hand
,
and
lead
me
up
to
the
altar
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
my
dear
girl
,
whisper
he
,
and
be
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
<EOS>
I
will
,
sir
,
say
I
;
but
I
hardly
know
what
I
say
;
and
so
you
may
believe
,
when
I
say
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
do
not
leave
me
;
pray
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
do
not
leave
me
;
as
if
I
have
all
confidence
in
her
,
and
none
where
it
be
most
due
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
keep
close
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
but
I
never
be
so
absent
in
my
life
,
as
at
first
;
even
till
Mr.
Williams
have
go
on
in
the
service
,
so
far
as
to
the
awful
word
about
require
us
,
as
we
should
answer
at
the
dreadful
day
of
judgment
;
and
then
the
solemn
word
,
and
my
master
's
whispering
<EOS>
,
mind
this
,
my
dear
,
make
me
start
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
still
whisper
<EOS>
,
know
you
any
impediment
?
 
<EOS>
I
blush
,
and
say
softly
,
none
,
sir
,
but
my
great
unworthiness
.
  
<EOS>
then
follow
the
sweet
word
,
Wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wed
wife
?
<EOS>
etc
.
<EOS>
and
I
begin
to
take
heart
a
little
,
when
my
dear
master
answer
,
audibly
,
to
this
question
,
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
only
make
a
courtesy
,
when
they
ask
me
;
though
,
I
be
sure
,
my
heart
be
ready
than
my
speech
,
and
answer
to
every
article
of
obey
,
serve
,
love
,
and
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
give
me
away
;
and
I
say
,
after
Mr.
Williams
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
as
my
dear
master
do
with
a
much
well
grace
,
the
word
of
betrothment
;
and
the
ceremony
of
the
ring
pass
next
,
I
receive
the
dear
favour
at
his
worthy
hand
with
a
most
grateful
heart
;
and
he
be
pleased
to
say
afterwards
in
the
chariot
,
<EOS>
that
when
he
have
do
say
,
with
this
ring
I

would

etc

<EOS>
I

a
courtesy
,
and
say
,
thank
you
,

<EOS>
May
be

overwhelmed
with
his
goodness
,
and
the
tender
grace
wherewith

.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
,
that
the
next
part
be
the
prayer
,
and
kneel
;
for
I
tremble
so
,
I
could

and

?
 
<EOS>
a
little
more
composed
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
you
see
this
be
not
so
dreadful
an
affair
as
you
apprehend
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
Mr.
Peters
,
very
kindly
,
it
be
a
very
solemn
circumstance
;
and
I
love
to
see
it
so
reverently
and
awfully
enter
upon
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
most
excellent
sign
;
for
the
most
thoughtful
beginning
make
the
most
prudent
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
of
her
own
accord
,
come
in
with
a
large
silver
tumbler
,
fill
with
sack
,
and
a
toast
,
and
nutmeg
,
and
sugar
;
and
my
master
say
,
that
be
well
thought
of
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
for
we
have
make
but
sorry
breakfasting
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
would
make
me
,
take
some
of
the
toast
;
as
they
all
do
,
and
drank
pretty
heartily
:
and
I
drank
a
little
,
and
it
cheer
my
heart
,
I
think
,
for
an
hour
after
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
take
a
fine
diamond
ring
from
his
finger
,
and
present
it
to
Mr.
Peters
,
who
receive
it
very
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
Mr.
Williams
he
say
,
<EOS>
My
old
acquaintance
,
I
have
reserve
for
you
,
against
a
variety
of
solicitation
,
the
living
I
always
design
for
you
;
and
I
beg
you
will
prepare
to
take
possession
of
it
;
and
as
the
do
it
may
be
attend
with
some
expense
,
pray
accept
of
this
towards
it
;
and
so
he
give
him
(
<EOS>
as
he
tell
me
afterwards
it
be
)
<EOS>
a
bank
note
of
50l
.
  
<EOS>
so
do
this
generous
good
gentleman
bless
us
all
,
and
me
in
particular
;
for
whose
sake
he
be
as
bounteous
as
if
he
have
marry
one
of
the
noble
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
take
his
leave
of
the
gentleman
,
recommend
secrecy
again
,
for
a
few
day
,
and
they
leave
him
;
and
none
of
the
servant
suspect
any
thing
,
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
believe
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
throw
myself
at
his
foot
,
bless
God
,
and
bless
him
for
his
goodness
;
and
he
overwhelm
me
with
kindness
,
call
me
his
sweet
bride
,
and
twenty
lovely
epithet
<EOS>
,
that
swell
my
grateful
heart
beyond
the
power
of
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
He
afterwards
lead
me
to
the
chariot
;
and
we
take
a
delightful
tour
round
the
neighbouring
village
;
and
he
do
all
he
could
to
dissipate
those
still
perverse
anxiety
that
dwell
upon
my
mind
,
and
,
do
what
I
can
,
spread
too
thoughtful
an
air
,
as
he
tell
me
,
over
my
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
home
again
by
half
an
hour
after
one
;
and
he
be
please
himself
with
thinking
,
not
to
be
an
hour
out
of
my
company
this
bless
day
,
that
(
as
he
be
so
good
as
to
say
)
he
may
inspire
me
with
a
familiarity
that
should
improve
my
confidence
in
him
,
when
he
be
tell
,
that
a
footman
of
Sir
Charles
Hargrave
have
be
here
,
to
let
him
know
,
that
his
master
,
and
two
other
gentleman
,
be
on
the
road
to
take
a
dinner
with
him
,
in
their
way
to
Nottingham
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
heartily
vex
at
this
,
and
say
to
me
,
He
should
have
be
glad
of
their
company
at
any
other
time
;
but
that
it
be
a
barbarous
intrusion
now
;
and
he
wish
they
have
be
tell
he
would
not
be
at
home
at
dinner
:
and
besides
,
say
he
,
they
be
horrid
drinker
;
and
I
shall
not
be
able
to
get
them
away
to
-
night
,
perhaps
;
for
they
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
travel
round
the
country
,
and
beat
up
their
friend
'
quarter
all
the
way
;
and
it
be
all
one
to
them
,
whether
they
stay
a
night
or
a
month
at
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
add
he
,
I
will
find
some
way
,
if
I
can
,
to
turn
them
off
,
after
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
confound
them
,
say
he
,
in
a
violent
pet
,
that
they
should
come
this
day
,
of
all
the
day
in
the
year
!
  
<EOS>
We
have
hardly
alight
,
and
get
in
,
before
they
come
:
three
mad
rake
they
seem
to
be
,
as
I
look
through
the
window
,
set
up
a
hunting
note
,
as
soon
as
they
come
to
the
gate
,
that
make
the
court
-
yard
echo
again
;
and
smack
their
whip
in
concert
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
up
to
my
chamber
,
and
see
(
what
make
my
heart
throb
)
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
officious
pain
to
put
the
room
in
order
for
a
guest
,
that
,
however
welcome
,
as
now
my
duty
teach
me
to
say
,
be
yet
dreadful
to
me
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
take
refuge
in
my
closet
,
and
have
recourse
to
pen
and
ink
,
for
my
amusement
,
and
to
divert
my
anxiety
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
if
one
's
heart
be
so
sad
,
and
one
's
apprehension
so
great
,
where
one
so
extremely
love
,
and
be
so
extremely
obliged
;
what
must
be
the
case
of
those
poor
maiden
,
who
be
force
,
for
sordid
view
,
by
their
tyrannical
parent
or
guardian
,
to
marry
the
man
they
almost
hate
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
the
loss
of
the
man
they
most
love
!
 
<EOS>
o
that
be
a
sad
thing
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
have
not
such
cruel
parent
to
answer
for
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
do
not
such
poor
innocent
victim
suffer
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
bless
be
God
,
this
lot
be
far
from
be
mine
!
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
(
for
I
can
not
yet
have
the
presumption
to
call
him
by
a
more
tender
name
)
come
up
to
me
,
and
say
,
well
,
I
just
come
to
ask
my
dear
bride
(
o
the
charming
,
charming
word
!
)
<EOS>
how
she
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
be
write
,
my
dear
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
these
confound
rake
be
half
mad
,
I
think
,
and
will
make
me
so
!
 
<EOS>
however
,
say
he
,
I
have
order
my
chariot
to
be
get
ready
,
as
if
I
be
under
an
engagement
five
mile
off
,
and
will
set
them
out
of
the
house
,
if
possible
;
and
then
ride
round
,
and
come
back
,
as
soon
as
I
can
get
rid
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
say
he
,
Lady
Davers
be
full
of
our
affair
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
take
great
freedom
with
me
before
Sir
Charles
;
and
they
have
all
be
at
me
,
without
mercy
;
and
I
be
force
to
be
very
serious
with
them
,
or
else
they
would
have
come
up
to
have
see
you
,
since
I
would
not
call
you
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
kiss
me
,
and
say
,
I
shall
quarrel
with
them
,
if
I
can
not
get
them
away
;
for
I
have
lose
two
or
three
precious
hour
with
my
soul
's
delight
:
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
down
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
ask
me
to
walk
down
to
dinner
in
the
little
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
down
,
and
she
be
so
complaisant
as
to
offer
to
wait
upon
me
at
table
;
and
would
not
be
persuade
,
without
difficulty
,
to
sit
down
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
insist
she
should
:
for
,
say
I
,
it
would
be
very
extraordinary
,
if
one
should
so
soon
go
into
such
distance
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
w
hatever
<EOS>
my
new
station
may
require
of
me
,
add
I
,
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
always
conduct
myself
in
such
a
manner
,
that
pride
and
insolence
shall
bear
no
part
in
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
very
good
,
madam
,
say
she
;
but
I
will
always
know
my
duty
to
my
master
's
lady
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
reply
I
,
if
I
must
take
state
upon
me
so
early
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
let
me
exact
from
you
what
you
call
your
duty
;
and
sit
down
with
me
when
I
desire
you
.
  
<EOS>
this
prevail
upon
her
;
and
I
make
shift
to
get
down
a
bit
of
apple
-
pye
,
and
a
little
custard
;
but
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
master
come
in
again
,
and
say
,
well
,
thank
my
star
!
<EOS>
these
rake
be
go
now
;
but
I
must
set
out
with
them
,
and
I
choose
my
chariot
;
for
if
I
take
horse
,
I
should
have
difficulty
to
part
with
them
;
for
they
be
like
a
snowball
,
and
intend
to
gather
company
as
they
go
,
to
make
a
merry
tour
of
it
for
some
day
together
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
get
up
,
when
he
come
in
:
Fie
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
why
this
ceremony
now
?
 
<EOS>
Sit
still
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
sir
,
say
she
,
I
be
loath
to
sit
down
;
but
my
lady
would
have
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
right
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
my
master
,
and
tap
me
on
the
cheek
;
for
we
be
but
yet
half
married
;
and
so
she
be
not
above
half
your
lady
yet
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
look
so
down
,
do
not
be
so
silent
,
my
dear
,
say
he
;
why
,
you
hardly
speak
twenty
word
to
me
all
the
time
we
be
out
together
.
 
<EOS>
something
I
will
allow
for
your
bashful
sweetness
;
but
not
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
have
you
no
pleasant
tale
to
tell
my
Pamela
,
to
make
her
smile
,
till
I
return
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
she
,
I
could
tell
twenty
pleasant
story
;
but
my
lady
be
too
nice
to
hear
them
;
and
yet
,
I
hope
,
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
shock
neither
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
think
I
<EOS>
;
thy
chaste
story
will
make
a
modest
person
blush
,
if
I
know
thee
!
<EOS>
and
I
desire
to
hear
none
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
say
,
tell
her
one
of
the
short
you
have
,
in
my
hearing
.
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
say
she
,
I
know
a
bashful
young
lady
,
as
madam
may
be
,
married
to
 
Dear
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
interrupt
I
,
no
more
of
your
story
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
;
I
do
not
like
the
beginning
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
go
on
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
say
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
pray
,
sir
,
do
not
require
it
,
say
I
,
pray
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
then
we
will
have
it
another
time
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
Abraham
come
in
to
tell
him
the
gentleman
be
go
,
and
that
his
chariot
be
ready
;
I
be
glad
of
that
,
say
he
;
and
go
to
them
,
and
set
out
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
after
they
be
go
:
and
have
walk
a
while
,
I
say
,
I
should
be
glad
of
her
company
down
the
elm
-
walk
,
to
meet
the
chariot
:
<EOS>
for
,
o
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
look
up
at
him
,
when
he
be
with
me
;
nor
how
to
bear
his
absence
,
when
I
have
reason
to
expect
him
:
what
a
strange
contradiction
there
be
in
this
unaccountable
passion
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
different
aspect
every
thing
in
and
about
this
house
bear
now
,
to
my
thinking
,
to
what
it
once
have
!
 
<EOS>
the
garden
,
the
pond
,
the
alcove
,
the
elm
-
walk
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
prison
be
become
my
palace
;
and
no
wonder
every
thing
wear
another
face
!
  
<EOS>
We
sit
down
upon
the
broad
stile
,
lead
towards
the
road
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
quite
another
person
to
me
,
to
what
she
be
the
last
time
I
sit
there
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
my
good
beloved
return
,
and
alight
there
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
my
Pamela
!
<EOS>
(
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
then
leave
me
,
)
<EOS>
what
(
say
he
,
and
kiss
me
)
bring
you
this
way
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
to
meet
me
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
<EOS>
I.
 
that
be
kind
,
indeed
,
say
he
;
but
why
that
avert
eye
?
 
<EOS>
that
downcast
countenance
,
as
if
you
be
afraid
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
think
so
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
revive
my
heart
then
,
say
he
,
with
a
more
cheerful
aspect
;
and
let
that
over
-
anxious
solicitude
,
which
appear
in
the
most
charming
face
in
the
world
,
be
chase
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
,
my
dear
girl
any
fear
that
I
can
dissipate
;
<EOS>
any
doubt
that
I
can
obviate
;
any
hope
that
I
can
encourage
;
any
request
that
I
can
gratify
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
,
my
dear
Pamela
;
and
if
I
have
power
,
but
speak
,
and
to
purchase
one
smile
,
it
shall
be
do
!
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
sir
,
say
I
,
have
any
fear
,
any
doubt
,
but
that
I
shall
never
be
able
to
deserve
all
your
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
hope
,
but
that
my
future
conduct
may
be
agreeable
to
you
,
and
my
determined
duty
well
accept
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
I
any
request
to
make
,
but
that
you
will
forgive
all
my
imperfection
and
,
among
the
rest
,
this
foolish
weakness
,
that
make
me
seem
to
you
,
after
all
the
generous
thing
that
have
pass
,
to
want
this
further
condescension
,
and
these
kind
assurance
.
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
,
sir
,
I
be
oppress
by
your
bounty
;
my
spirit
sink
under
the
weight
of
it
;
and
the
oppression
be
still
the
great
,
as
I
see
not
how
,
possibly
,
in
my
whole
future
life
,
by
all
I
can
do
,
to
merit
the
least
of
your
favour
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
your
grateful
heart
,
say
he
;
but
remember
,
my
dear
,
what
the
lawyer
tell
us
,
that
marriage
be
the
high
consideration
which
the
law
know
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
,
my
sweet
bride
,
have
make
you
mine
,
and
me
your
;
and
you
have
the
good
claim
in
the
world
to
share
my
fortune
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
set
that
consideration
aside
,
what
be
the
obligation
you
have
to
me
?
<EOS>
Your
mind
be
pure
as
that
of
an
angel
,
and
as
much
transcend
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Your
wit
,
and
your
judgment
,
to
make
you
no
compliment
,
be
more
than
equal
to
mine
:
You
have
all
the
grace
that
education
can
give
a
woman
,
improve
by
a
genius
which
make
those
grace
natural
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
sweetness
of
temper
,
and
a
noble
sincerity
,
beyond
all
comparison
;
and
in
the
beauty
of
your
person
,
you
excel
all
the
lady
I
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
where
then
,
my
dear
,
be
the
obligation
,
if
not
on
my
side
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
to
avoid
these
comparison
,
let
us
talk
of
nothing
henceforth
but
equality
;
although
,
if
the
rich
of
your
mind
,
and
your
unblemished
virtue
,
be
set
against
my
fortune
,
(
which
be
but
an
accidental
good
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
and
all
I
have
to
boast
of
,
)
the
condescension
will
be
yours
;
and
I
shall
not
think
I
can
possibly
deserve
you
,
till
,
after
your
sweet
example
,
my
future
life
shall
become
nearly
as
blameless
as
yours
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
I
,
what
comfort
do
you
give
me
,
<EOS>
that
,
instead
of
my
being
in
danger
of
be
ensnare
by
the
high
condition
to
which
your
goodness
have
exalt
me
,
you
make
me
hope
,
that
I
shall
be
confirm
and
approve
by
you
;
and
that
we
may
have
a
prospect
of
perpetuate
each
other
's
happiness
,
till
time
shall
be
no
more
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
I
will
not
,
as
you
once
caution
me
,
be
too
serious
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
resolve
,
with
these
sweet
encouragement
,
to
be
,
in
every
thing
,
what
you
would
have
me
be
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
I
shall
,
more
and
more
,
shew
you
that
I
have
no
will
but
yours
.
 
<EOS>
He
kiss
me
very
tenderly
,
and
thank
me
for
this
kind
assurance
,
as
he
call
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
we
enter
the
house
together
.
  
<EOS>
eight
o'clock
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
now
these
sweet
assurance
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
you
will
say
,
must
be
very
consolatory
to
me
;
and
be
voluntary
on
his
side
,
be
all
that
could
be
wish
for
on
mine
;
and
I
be
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
subdue
my
idle
fear
and
apprehension
.
  
<EOS>
ten
o'clock
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
sit
at
supper
,
he
be
generously
kind
to
me
,
as
well
in
his
action
,
as
expression
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
notice
,
in
the
most
delicate
manner
,
of
my
endeavour
to
conquer
my
foible
;
and
say
,
I
see
,
with
pleasure
,
my
dear
girl
strive
to
comport
herself
in
a
manner
suitable
to
my
wish
:
I
see
,
even
through
the
sweet
tender
struggle
of
your
over
-
nice
modesty
,
how
much
I
owe
to
your
intention
of
oblige
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
once
tell
you
,
that
I
be
the
conquest
more
of
your
virtue
than
your
beauty
;
so
not
one
alarm
word
or
look
<EOS>
shall
my
beloved
Pamela
hear
or
see
,
to
give
her
reason
to
suspect
the
truth
of
what
I
aver
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
the
rather
believe
me
,
continue
he
,
as
you
may
see
the
pain
I
have
to
behold
any
thing
that
concern
you
,
even
though
your
concern
be
causeless
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
will
indulge
my
dear
girl
's
bashful
weakness
so
far
,
as
to
own
,
that
so
pure
a
mind
may
suffer
from
apprehension
,
on
so
important
a
change
as
this
;
and
I
can
therefore
be
only
displeased
with
such
part
of
your
conduct
,
as
may
make
your
suffering
great
than
my
own
;
when
I
be
resolve
,
through
every
stage
of
my
future
life
,
in
all
event
,
to
study
to
make
them
less
.
  
<EOS>
after
supper
,
of
which
,
with
all
his
sweet
persuasion
,
I
could
hardly
taste
,
he
make
me
drink
two
glass
of
champaign
,
and
,
afterwards
,
a
glass
of
sack
;
which
he
kindly
force
upon
me
,
by
name
your
health
:
and
as
the
time
of
retire
draw
on
,
he
take
notice
,
but
in
a
very
delicate
manner
,
how
my
colour
go
and
come
,
and
how
foolishly
I
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
,
surely
,
in
such
delightful
circumstance
,
ever
behave
so
silly
!
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
My
dear
girl
,
I
fear
you
have
have
too
much
of
my
company
for
so
many
hour
together
;
and
would
better
recollect
yourself
,
if
you
retire
for
half
an
hour
to
your
closet
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
for
this
,
but
durst
not
say
so
much
,
lest
he
should
be
angry
;
for
,
as
the
hour
grow
on
,
I
find
my
apprehension
increase
,
and
my
silly
heart
be
the
unquieter
,
every
time
I
could
lift
up
my
eye
to
his
dear
face
;
so
sweetly
terrible
<EOS>
do
he
appear
to
my
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
You
be
all
goodness
,
dear
sir
;
<EOS>
and
I
boldly
kiss
his
dear
hand
,
and
press
it
to
my
lip
with
both
mine
.
 
<EOS>
and
salute
me
very
fervently
,
he
give
me
his
hand
,
see
me
hardly
able
to
stand
,
and
lead
me
to
my
chamber
-
door
,
and
then
most
generously
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
closet
;
and
the
first
thing
I
do
,
on
my
knee
,
again
thank
God
for
the
blessing
of
the
day
;
and
besought
his
divine
goodness
to
conduct
my
future
life
in
such
a
manner
,
as
should
make
me
a
happy
instrument
of
his
glory
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
,
be
now
leave
to
my
own
recollection
,
I
grow
a
little
more
assured
and
lightsome
;
and
the
pen
and
paper
being
before
me
,
I
amuse
myself
with
writing
thus
far
.
  
<EOS>
eleven
o'clock

Friday

<EOS>
He

my
weakness
of
mind
,
allow
for
all
my
little
foible

endeavour
to
dissipate
my
fear
;
his
word
be
so
pure
,
his
idea
so
chaste
,
and
his
whole
behaviour
so
sweetly
decent
,
that
never
,
surely
,
be
so
happy
a
creature
as
your
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
hope
such
a
husband
could
have
fall
to
my
lot
:
and
much
less
,
that
a
gentleman
,
who
have
allow
himself
in
attempt
,
that
now
I
will
endeavour
to
forget
for
ever
,
should
have
behave
with
so
very
delicate
and
unexceptionable
a
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
no
light
frothy
jest
drop
from
his
lip
;
no
alarm
raillery
;
no
offensive
expression
,
nor
insult
air
,
reproach
or
wound
the
ear
of
your
happy
,
thrice
happy
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
say
every
thing
that
may
embolden
me
to
look
up
,
with
pleasure
,
upon
the
generous
author
of
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
at
breakfast
,
when
I
know
not
how
to
see
him
,
he
embolden
me
by
talk
of
you
,
my
dear
parent
;
a
subject
,
he
generously
know
,
I
could
talk
of
:
and
give
me
assurance
,
that
he
would
make
you
both
happy
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
He
would
have
me
send
you
a
letter
to
acquaint
you
with
my
nuptial
;
and
,
as
he
could
make
business
that
way
,
Thomas
should
carry
it
purposely
,
as
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
nor
will
I
,
say
he
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
desire
to
see
your
writing
,
because
I
tell
you
I
would

for
now
I
will
,
in
every
thing
,
religiously
keep
my
word
with
my

spouse
:
(
o

)
<EOS>
and
you
may
send
all
your
paper
to

,
from
those

have
,
down
to
this
happy
moment
;
only
let
me
beg
they
will
preserve
them
,
and
let
me
have
them
when
they
have
read
them
;
as
also
those
I
have
not
see
;
which
,
however
,
I
desire
not
to
see
till
then
;
but
then
shall
take
it
for
a
favour
,
if
you
will
grant
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
my
pleasure
,
as
well
as
my
duty
,
sir
,
say
I
,
to
obey
you
in
every
thing
:
and
I
will
write
up
to

conclusion
of
this
day
,
that
they
may
see
how
happy
you
have
make
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
both
join
with
me
to
bless
God
for
his
wonderful
mercy
and
goodness
to
you
,
as
well
as

:
for
he
be
pleased
to
ask
me
particularly
after
your
circumstance
,
and
say
,
He
have
take
notice
,
that
I
have
hint
,
in
some
of
my
first
letter
,
that
you
owe
money
in
the
world
;
and
he
give
me
fifty
guinea
,
and
bid
me
send
them
to
you
in
my
packet
,
to
pay
your
debt
,
as
far
as
they
would
go
;
and
that
you
would
quit
your
present
business
,
and
put
yourself
,
and
my
dear
mother
,
into
a
creditable
appearance
;
and
he
would
find
a
well
place
of
abode
for
you
than

when

to
Bedfordshire
.
 
<EOS>
o

exceed
great
and
generous
favour
!
 
<EOS>
I

parcel
,
in
double
paper
.
  
<EOS>
to
me
he

no
less
than
one
hundred
guinea
more
;
and
say
,
I
would
have
you
,
my
dear
,
give
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
when
you
go
away
from
hence
<EOS>
,
what
you
think
fit
out
of
these
,
as
from
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
good
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
let
that
be
what
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
give
her
,
then
,
say
he
,
twenty
guinea
,
as
a
compliment
on
your
nuptial
.
 
<EOS>
give
Colbrand
ten
guinea
give
:
the

<EOS>
to

this
house
five

give

give

and
give
the
gardener
,
groom
,
and
helper
,
twenty
guinea
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
,
say
he
,
I
return
with
you
to
the
other
house
,
I
will
make
you
a
suitable
present
,
to
buy
you
such
ornament
as
be
fit
for
my
beloved
wife
to
appear
in
.
 
<EOS>
for
now
,
my
Pamela
,
continue
he
,
you
be
not
to
mind
,
as
you
once
propose
,
what
other
lady
will
say
;
but
to
appear
as
my
wife
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
else
it
would
look
as
if
what
you
think
of
,
as
a
means
to
avoid
the
envy
of
other
of
your
sex
,
be
a
wilful
slight
in
me
,
which
,
I
hope
,
I
never
shall
be
guilty
of
;
and
I
will
shew
the
world
,
that
I
value
you
as
I
ought
,
and
as
if
I
have
marry
the
first
fortune
in
the
kingdom
:
<EOS>
and
why
should
it
not
be
so
,
when
I
know
none
of
the
first
quality
that
match
you
in
excellence
?
  
<EOS>
He
see
I
be
at
a
loss
for
word
,
and
say
,
I
see
,
my
dear
bride
!
<EOS>
my
spouse
!
<EOS>
my
wife
!
<EOS>
my
Pamela
!
<EOS>
your
grateful
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
and
kiss
me
,
as
I
be
go
to
speak
,
I
will
stop
your
dear
mouth
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
You
shall
not
so
much
as
thank
me
;
for
when
I
have
do
ten
time
more
than
this
,
I
shall
but
poorly
express
my
love
for
so
much
beauty
of
mind
,
and
loveliness
of
person
;
which
thus
,
say
he
,
and
clasp
me
to
his
generous
bosom
,
I
can
proudly
now
call
my
own
!
 
<EOS>
o
how
,
my
dear
parent
,
can
I
think
of
any
thing
,
but
redouble
love
,
joy
,
and
gratitude
!
  
<EOS>
and
thus
generously
do
he
banish
from
my
mind
those
painful
reflection
,
and
bashful
apprehension
,
<EOS>
that
make
me
dread
to
see
him
for
the
first
time
this
day
,
when
I
be
call
to
attend
him
at
breakfast
;
and
make
me
all
ease
,
composure
,
and
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
,
think
I
seem
somewhat
thoughtful
,
propose
a
little
turn
in
the
chariot
till
dinner
-
time
:
<EOS>
and
this
be
another
sweet
relief
to
me
;
and
he
divert
me
with
twenty
agreeable
relation
,
of
what
observation
he
have
make
in
his
travel
;
and
give
me
the
character
of
the
lady
and
gentleman
in
his
other
neighbourhood
;
tell
me
whose
acquaintance
he
would
have
me
most
cultivate
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
mention
Lady
Davers
with
apprehension
,
he
say
,
to
be
sure
I
love
my
sister
dearly
,
notwithstanding
her
violent
spirit
;
and
I
know
she
love
me
;
<EOS>
and
I
can
allow
a
little
for
her
pride
,
because
I
know
what
my
own
so
lately
be
;
and
because
she
know
not
my
Pamela
,
and
her
excellency
,
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
,
my
dear
,
forget
what
belong
to
your
character
,
as
my
wife
,
nor
meanly
stoop
to
her
;
though
I
know
you
will
choose
,
by
softness
,
to
try
to
move
her
to
a
proper
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
shall
be
my
part
to
see
,
that
you
do
not
yield
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
continue
he
,
as
I
would
not
publicly
declare
my
marriage
here
<EOS>
,
I
hope
she
will
not
come
near
us
till
we
be
in
Bedfordshire
;
and
then
,
when
she
know
we
be
married
,
she
will
keep
away
,
if
she
be
not
willing
to
be
reconcile
;
for
she
dare
not
,
surely
,
come
to
quarrel
with
me
,
when
she
know
it
be
do
;
for
that
would
have
a
hateful
and
wicked
appearance
,
as
if
she
would
try
to
make
difference
between
man
and
wife
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
will
have
no
more
of
this
subject
,
nor
talk
of
any
thing
,
add
he
,
that
shall
give
concern
to
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
change
the
talk
to
a
more
pleasing
subject
,
and
say
the
kind
and
most
soothing
thing
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
home
,
which
be
about
dinner
-
time
,
he
be
the
same
obliging
,
kind
gentleman
;
and
,
in
short
,
be
studious
to
shew
,
on
every
occasion
,
his
generous
affection
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
after
dinner
,
he
tell
me
,
he
have
already
write
to
his
draper
,
in
town
,
to
provide
him
new
livery
;
and
to
his
late
mother
's
mercer
,
to
send
him
down
pattern
of
the
most
fashionable
silk
,
for
my
choice
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
be
unable
to
express
my
gratitude
for
his
favour
and
generosity
:
<EOS>
and
as
he
know
best
what
befit
his
own
rank
and
condition
,
I
would
wholly
remit
myself
to
his
good
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
by
all
his
repeat
bounty
to
me
,
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
,
I
could
not
but
look
forward
with
awe
upon
the
condition
to
which
he
have
exalt
me
;
and
now
I
fear
I
should
hardly
be
able
to
act
up
to
it
in
such
a
manner
as
should
justify
the
choice
he
have
condescend
to
make
:
but
that
,
I
hope
,
I
should
have
not
only
his
generous
allowance
for
my
imperfection
,
<EOS>
which
I
could
only
assure
him
should
not
be
wilful
one
,
but
his
kind
instruction
;
and
that
as
often
as
he
observe
any
part
of
my
conduct
such
as
he
could
not
entirely
approve
,
he
would
let
me
know
it
;
and
I
would
think
his
reproofs
of
beginning
fault
the
kind
and
most
affectionate
thing
in
the
world
because
they
would
keep
me
from
commit
great
;
and
be
a
means
to
continue
to
me
the
blessing
of
his
good
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
He
answer
me
in
the
kind
manner
;
and
assure
me
,
that
nothing
should
ever
lie
upon
his
mind
which
he
would
not
reveal
,
and
give
me
an
opportunity
either
of
convince
him
,
or
be
convince
myself
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
ask
me
,
when
I
should
be
willing
to
go
to
the
Bedfordshire
house
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
whenever
he
please
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
come
down
hither
again
before
the
winter
,
say
he
,
if
you
please
,
in
order
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
you
have
begin
with
Lady
Jones
,
and
Sir
Simon
's
family
;
and
,
if
it
please
God
to
spare
us
to
one
another
,
in
the
winter
I
will
give
you
,
as
I
promise
for
two
or
three
month
,
the
diversion
of
London
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
,
add
he
,
<EOS>
if
my
dear
please
,
we
will
set
out
next
week
,
about
Tuesday
,
for
t'other
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
objection
,
sir
,
say
I
,
to
any
thing
you
propose
;
but
how
will
you
avoid
Miss
Darnford
's
solicitation
for
an
evening
to
dance
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
we
can
make
Monday
evening
do
for
that
purpose
,
if
they
will
not
excuse
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
please
,
say
he
,
I
will
invite
Lady
Jones
,
Mr.
Peters
and
his
family
,
and
Sir
Simon
and
his
family
,
to
my
little
chapel
,
on
Sunday
morning
,
and
to
stay
dinner
with
me
;
and
then
I
will
declare
my
marriage
to
them
,
because
my
dear
life
shall
not
leave
this
country
with
the
least
reason
for
a
possibility
of
any
body
's
doubt
that
it
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
how
good
be
this
!
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
his
conduct
be
all
of
a
piece
,
noble
,
kind
,
and
considerate
!
<EOS>
what
a
happy
creature
be
I
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
may
be
,
say
he
,
they
will
excuse
us
till
we
return
into
this
country
again
,
as
to
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
any
thing
,
add
he
,
that
my
beloved
Pamela
have
still
to
wish
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
,
freely
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
my
dear
sir
,
reply
I
,
you
have
not
only
prevent
my
wish
,
but
my
hope
,
and
even
my
thought
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
must
own
,
since
your
kind
command
of
speak
my
mind
seem
to
shew
,
that
you
expect
from
me
I
should
say
something
;
that
I
have
only
one
or
two
thing
to
wish
more
,
and
then
I
shall
be
too
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Say
,
say
he
,
what
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
proceed
I
,
I
be
,
indeed
,
ashamed
to
ask
any
thing
,
lest
it
should
not
be
agreeable
to
you
;
and
lest
it
should
look
as
if
I
be
take
advantage
of
your
kind
condescension
to
me
,
and
know
not
when
to
be
satisfied
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
that
you
be
not
to
imagine
,
that
these
thing
,
which
I
have
do
,
in
hope
of
oblige
you
,
be
the
sudden
impulse
of
a
new
passion
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
can
answer
for
my
own
mind
,
they
proceed
from
a
regular
and
uniform
desire
of
oblige
you
:
which
,
I
hope
,
will
last
as
long
as
your
merit
last
;
and
that
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
will
be
as
long
as
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
the
rather
answer
for
this
,
because
I
really
find
so
much
delight
in
myself
in
my
present
way
of
thinking
and
act
,
as
infinitely
overpay
me
;
and
which
,
for
that
reason
,
I
be
likely
to
continue
,
for
both
our
sake
.
 
<EOS>
My
beloved
wife
,
therefore
,
say
he
,
for
methink
I
be
grow
fond
of
a
name
I
once
despise
<EOS>
,
may
venture
to
speak
her
mind
;
and
I
will
promise
,
that
,
so
far
as
it
be
agreeable
to
me
,
and
I
cheerfully
can
,
I
will
comply
;
and
you
will
not
insist
upon
it
,
if
that
should
not
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
ought
not
,
neither
will
I.
 
<EOS>
and
now
you
embolden
me
to
become
an
humble
petitioner
,
and
that
,
as
I
ought
,
upon
my
knee
,
for
the
reinstating
such
of
your
servant
,
as
I
have
be
the
unhappy
occasion
of
their
disoblige
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
raise
me
up
,
and
say
,
My
beloved
Pamela
have
too
often
be
in
this
suppliant
posture
to
me
,
to
permit
it
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
rise
,
my
fair
,
and
let
me
know
whom
,
in
particular
,
you
would
reinstate
;
and
he
kindly
hold
me
in
his
arm
,
and
press
me
to
his
beloved
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
sir
,
say
I
,
in
the
first
place
;
for
she
be
a
good
woman
;
and
the
misfortune
she
have
have
in
the
world
,
must
make
your
displeasure
most
heavy
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
who
next
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
,
sir
,
say
I
;
and
I
be
sure
,
kind
as
they
have
be
to
me
,
yet
would
I
not
ask
it
,
if
I
could
not
vouch
for
their
integrity
,
and
if
I
do
not
think
it
be
my
dear
master
's
interest
to
have
such
good
servant
.
  
<EOS>
have
you
any
thing
further
?
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
your
good
old
butler
,
who
have
so
long
be
in
your
family
before
the
day
of
your
happy
birth
,
I
would
,
if
I
may
,
become
an
advocate
for
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
I
have
only
to
say
,
that
have
not
Mr.
Longman
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Jonathan
too
,
join
in
a
body
,
<EOS>
in
a
bold
appeal
to
Lady
Davers
,
which
have
give
her
the
insolent
handle
she
have
take
to
intermeddle
in
my
affair
,
I
could
easily
have
forgive
all
the
rest
of
their
conduct
;
though
they
have
give
their
tongue
no
little
license
about
me
:
but
I
could
have
forgive
them
,
because
I
desire
every
body
should
admire
you
;
and
it
be
with
pride
that
I
observe
not
only
their
opinion
and
love
,
but
that
of
every
body
else
that
know
you
,
justify
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
I
will
forgive
even
this
,
because
my
Pamela
desire
it
;
and
I
will
send
a
letter
myself
,
to
tell
Longman
what
he
owe
to
your
interposition
,
if
the
estate
he
have
make
in
my
family
do
not
set
him
above
the
acceptance
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
do
you
,
my
dear
,
write
a
letter
to
her
,
and
give
her
your
command
,
instantly
,
on
,
the
receipt
of
it
,
to
go
and
take
possession
of
her
former
charge
;
for
now
,
my
dear
girl
,
she
will
be
more
immediately
your
servant
;
and
I
know
you
love
her
so
well
,
that
you
will
go
thither
with
the
more
pleasure
to
find
her
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
think
,
add
he
,
that
all
this
compliance
be
to
be
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
tell
me
but
what
I
can
do
,
poor
as
I
be
in
power
,
but
rich
in
will
;
and
I
will
not
hesitate
one
moment
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
say
he
,
of
your
own
accord
,
reward
me
for
my
cheerful
compliance
,
with
one
sweet
kiss
 
<EOS>
I
instantly
say
,
thus
,
then
,
dear
sir
,
will
I
obey
;
<EOS>
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
you
have
the
sweetest
and
most
generous
way
in
the
world
,
to
make
that
a
condition
,
which
give
me
double
honour
,
and
add
to
my
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
clasp
my
arm
about
his
neck
,
and
be
not
ashamed
to
kiss
him
once
and
twice
,
and
three
time
;
once
for
every
forgive
person
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
he
,
what
other
thing
have
you
to
ask
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
be
already
take
care
of
;
and
,
I
hope
,
will
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
nothing
to
say
for
John
Arnold
?
  
<EOS>
why
,
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
you
have
see
the
poor
fellow
's
penitence
in
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear
,
so
I
have
;
but
that
be
his
penitence
for
his
have
serve
me
against
you
;
and
,
I
think
,
when
he
would
have
betray
me
afterwards
,
he
deserve
nothing
to
be
say
or
do
for
him
by
either
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
this
be
a
day
of
jubilee
;
and
the
less
he
deserve
,
poor
fellow
,
the
more
will
be
your
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
and
let
me
add
one
word
;
that
as
he
be
divide
in
his
inclination
between
his
duty
to
you
and
good
wish
to
me
,
and
know
not
how
to
distinguish
between
the
one
and
the
other
,
when
he
find
us
so
happily
united
by
your
great
goodness
to
me
,
he
will
have
no
more
puzzle
in
his
duty
;
for
he
have
not
fail
in
any
other
part
of
it
;
but
,
I
hope
,
will
serve
you
faithfully
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
suppose
I
put
Mrs.
jewke
in
a
good
way
of
business
,
in
some
inn
,
and
give
her
John
for
a
husband
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
your
gipsy
story
will
be
make
out
,
that
she
will
have
a
husband
young
than
herself
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
all
goodness
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
I
can
freely
forgive
poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
and
wish
her
happy
.
 
<EOS>
but
permit
me
,
sir
,
to
ask
,
Would
not
this
look
like
a
very
heavy
punishment
to
poor
John
?
<EOS>
and
as
if
you
could
not
forgive
him
,
when
you
be
so
generous
to
every
body
else
?
  
<EOS>
He
smile
and
say
,
o
my
Pamela
,
this
,
for
a
forgiving
spirit
,
be
very
severe
upon
poor
jewke
:
<EOS>
but
I
shall
never
,
by
the
grace
of
God
,
have
any
more
such
try
service
,
to
put
him
or
the
rest
upon
;
and
if
you
can
forgive
him
,
I
think
I
may
:
<EOS>
and
so
John
shall
be
at
your
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
let
me
know
what
my
Pamela
have
furth
to
wish
?
  
<EOS>
o
,
my
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
not
a
single
wish
more
have
your
grateful
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
My
heart
be
overwhelmed
with
your
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
forgive
these
tear
of
joy
,
add
I
:
<EOS>
You
have
leave
me
nothing
to
pray
for
,
but
that
God
will
bless
you
with
life
,
and
health
,
and
honour
,
and
continue
to
me
the
blessing
of
your
esteem
;
and
I
shall
then
be
the
happy
creature
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
clasp
me
in
his
arm
,
and
say
,
You
can
not
,
my
dear
life
,
be
so
happy
in
me
,
as
I
be
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
heartily
I
despise
all
my
former
pursuit
,
and
headstrong
appetite
!
 
<EOS>
what
joy
,
what
true
joy
,
flow
from
virtuous
love
!
<EOS>
joy
which
the
narrow
soul
of
the
libertine
can
not
take
in
,
nor
his
thought
conceive
!
 
<EOS>
and
which
I
myself
,
whilst
a
libertine
,
have
not
the
least
notion
of
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
I
expect
my
dear
spouse
,
my
Pamela
,
have
something
to
ask
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
but
since
all
her
own
good
be
absorb

He
read
this

say
,
'
Tis
your

my

and
must
be
good
:
but
do
not
you
put
your

<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
your
goodness
have
give
me
a
right
to
a
very
honourable
one
<EOS>
but
as
this
be
the
first
occasion
of

except
that
to
my

I
think
I
ought
to

you
unsigne

that
I
may
not
seem
over

forward
to

<EOS>
however
sweetly
humble
and
requisite
,
say
he
,
this
may
appear
to
my

's
niceness
,
it
befit
me
to
tell

that
I
be
every

these

My

be
just
go
to
take
a
ride
out
,

intend
to
call
upon
Lady
Jones
,
Mr.
Peters
,
and
Sir
Simon
Darnford
,
to
invite
them
to
chapel
and
dinner
to
-
morrow
;
and
say
,
he
choose
to
do
it
himself
,
because
the
time
be
so
short
,
they
will
,
perhaps
,
deny
a
servant
.
  
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
mention
,
that
Mr.
Williams
be
here
yesterday
,
to
ask
leave
to
go
to
see
his
new
living
,
and
to
provide
for
take
possession
of
it
;
and
seem
so
pleased
with
my
master
's
kindness
and
fondness
for
me
,
as
well
as
his
generous
deportment
to
himself
,
that
he
leave
us
in
such
a
disposition
,
as
shew
he
be
quite
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
of
it
;
for
it
would
rejoice
me
to
be
an
humble
mean
of
make
all
mankind
so
:
<EOS>
and
oh
!
<EOS>
what
return
ought
I
not
to
make
to
the
divine
goodness
!
<EOS>
and
how
ought
I
to
strive
to
diffuse
the
blessing
I
experience
,
to
all
in
my
knowledge
!
  
<EOS>
F
or
else
,
what
be
it
for
such
a
worm
as
I
to
be
exalt

<EOS>
what
be
my
single
happiness
,
if
I
suffer
it
,
niggard
-
like
,
to
extend
no
farther
than
to
myself
?
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
indeed
,
do
God
Almighty
's
creature
act
worthy
of
the
blessing
they
receive
,
when
they
make
,
or
endeavour
to
make
,
<EOS>
the
whole
creation
,
so
far
as
be
in
the
circle
of
their
power

happy

<EOS>
great
and
good
God

<EOS>
as
thou
hast
enlarge
my
opportunity

enlarge
also
my
will
,
and
make
me
delight
in
dispense
to
other
a
portion
of
that
happiness

which
I
have
myself
so
plentifully

at

hand
of
thy
gracious
Providence
!
 
<EOS>
then
shall
I
not
be
useless
in
my
generation
!
 
<EOS>
then
shall
I
not
stand
a
single
mark
of
thy
goodness
to
a
poor
worthless
creature
,
that
in
herself
be
of
so
small
account
in
the
scale
of
being
,
a
mere
cipher
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
figure

but
shall
be
place
on
the
right
side

,
though
nothing
worth

shall
give
signification
by
my

multiply
the

I
owe
to
thy
goodness
,
which
have
distinguish
me
by
so
fair
a
lot
!
  
<EOS>
this
,
as
I
conceive
,
be
the
indispensable
duty
of
a
high
condition
;
and
how
great
must
be
the
condemnation
of
poor
creature
,
at
the
great
day
of
account
,
when
they
shall
be
ask
,
what
use
they
have
make
of
the
opportunity
put
into
their
hand
?
<EOS>
and
be
able
only
to
say
,
We
have
live
but
to
ourselves
:
<EOS>
We
have
circumscribe
all
the
power
thou
hast
give
us
into
one
narrow
,
selfish
,
compass
:
We
have
heap
up
treasure
for
those
who
come
after
us
,
though
we
know
not
whether
they
would
not
make
a
still
bad
use
of
them
than
we
ourselves
do
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
can
such
poor
selfish
pleader
expect
any
other
sentence
,
than
the
dreadful
,
Depart
,
ye
curse
!
  
<EOS>
but
sure
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
such
person
can
have
no
notion
of
the
exalted
pleasure
that
flow
from
do
good
,
be
there
to
be
no
after
-
account
at
all
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
satisfactory
and
pleasing
to
reflect
on
the
be
able
to
administer
comfort
and
relief
to
those
who
stand
in
need
of
it
,
as
infinitely
,
of
itself
,
reward
the
beneficent
mind
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
often
have
I
experience
this
in
my
good
lady
's
time
,
though
<EOS>
but
the
second
-
hand
dispenser
of
her
benefit
to
the
poor
and
sickly
,
when
she
make
me
her
almoner
!
 
<EOS>
how
have
I
be
affect
with
the
blessing
which
the
miserable
have
heap
upon
her
for
her
goodness
,
and
upon
me
for
be
<EOS>
but
the
humble
conveyer
of
her
bounty
to
them
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
delighted
have
I
be
,
when
the
move
report
I
have
make
of
a
particular
distress
,
have
augment
my
good
lady
's
first
intention
in
relief
of
it

<EOS>
this
I
recall
with
pleasure
,
because
it
be
now
,
by
the
divine
goodness
,
become
my
part
to
do
those
good
thing
she
be
<EOS>
will
not

<EOS>
and
oh

let
me
watch
myself

that
my

to
look
up

with
due
thankfulness

to
the
Providence

have

that
so
I
may
not

a
terrible
woe
by
the
abuse

neglect
of
it

<EOS>
forgive
me
these
reflection
,
my

and
let
me
have
your
prayer
,
that
I
may
not
find
my
present
happiness
a
snare
to
me
;
but
that
I
may
consider
,
that
more
and
more
will
be
expect
from
me
,
in
proportion
to
the
power
give
me
;
and
that
I
may
not
so
unworthily
act
,
as
if
I
believe
I
ought
to
set
up
my
rest
in
my
mean
self

and
think
nothing
further
to

Saturday

seven
o'clock
in

My

as
he
be
,
also
,
by
Sir
Simon

to
dine
with
him

<EOS>
but
Mr.
Peters
could
not
conveniently
provide
a
preacher
for
his
own
church
tomorrow
morning
,
at
so
short
a
notice
;
Mr.
Williams
be
go
,
as
I
say
,
to
his
new

;
but
believe
he
could
for
the
afternoon
;
and
so
he
promise
to
give
us
his
company
to
dinner
,
and
to
read
afternoon
service

<EOS>
and
this
make
my

invite
all
the
rest
,
as
well
as
him

to
dinner
,
and
not
to
church
;
and
he
make
them
promise
to
come
;
and
tell
Mr.
Peters
,
he
would
send
his
coach
for
him
and
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
tell
him
pleasantly
,
She
would
not
come
,
unless
he
would
promise
to
let
her
be
at
his
wedding
;
by
which
I
find
Mr.
Peters
have
keep
the
secret
,
as
my
master
desire
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
give
me
an
airing
after
dinner
in
the
chariot

renew
his

assurance
to
me

this

he
do
not
repent
of
his
condescension
to
me
;
and
it
encourage
me
to
look
up
to
him
with
more
satisfaction
of
mind
,
and
less
doubtfulness
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
leave
to
send
a
guinea
to
a
poor
body
in
the
town
,
that
I
hear
,
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
lie
very
ill
,
and
be
very
destitute
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
send
two
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
I
will
never
do
any
thing
of
this
kind
without
let
you
know
what
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
most
generously
answer
,
I
shall
then
,
perhaps
,
have
you
do
less
good
than
you
would
otherwise
do
,
from
a
doubt
of
me
;
though
,
I
hope
,
your
discretion
,
and
my
own
temper
,
which
be
not
avaricious
,
will
make
such
doubt
causeless
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
continue
he
,
I
will
tell
you
how
we
will
order
this
point
,
to
avoid
even
the
shadow
of
uneasiness
on
one
side
,
or
doubt
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
your
father
and
mother
,
in
the
first
place
,
they
shall
be
quite
out
of
the
question
;
for
I
have
already
determine
in
my
mind
about
them
;
and
it
be
thus
:
They
shall
go
down
,
if
they
and
you
think
well
of
it
,
to
my
little
kentish
estate
;
which
I
once
mention
to
you
in
such
a
manner
,
as
make
you
reject
it
with
a
nobleness
of
mind
,
that
give
me
pain
then
,
but
pleasure
since
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pretty
little
farm
,
and
house
,
untenanted
,
upon
that
estate
,
and
tolerably
well
stock
,
and
I
will
further
stock
it
for
them
;
for
such
industrious
folk
will
not
know
how
to
live
without
some
employment
;
and
it
shall
be
theirs
for
both
their
life
,
without
pay
any
rent
;
and
I
will
allow
them
50l
.
<EOS>
per
annum
besides
,
that
they
may
keep
up
the
stock
,
and
be
kind
to
any
other
of
their
relation
,
without
be
behold
to
you
or
me
for
small
matter
;
and
for
great
,
where
needful
,
you
shall
always
have
it
in
your
power
to
accommodate
them
;
for
I
shall
never
question
your
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
and
we
will
,
so
long
as
God
spare
our
life
,
go
down
,
once
a
year
,
to
see
them
;
and
they
shall
come
up
,
as
often
as
they
please
<EOS>
,
it
can
not
be
too
often
,
to
see
us
:
for
I
mean
not
this
,
my
dear
,
to
send
them
from
us
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
proceed
,
do
my
Pamela
like
this
?
  
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
say
I
,
the
english
tongue
afford
not
word
,
or
,
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
have
them
not
,
to
express
sufficiently
my
gratitude
!
 
<EOS>
teach
me
,
dear
sir
,
continue
I
,
and
press
his
dear
hand
to
my
lip
,
teach
me
some
other
language
,
if
there
be
any
,
that
abound
with
more
grateful
term
;
that
I
may
not
thus
be
choke
with
meaning
,
for
which
I
can
find
no
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
My
charmer
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
your
language
be
all
wonderful
,
as
your
sentiment
;
and
you
most
abound
,
when
you
seem
most
to
want
!
 
<EOS>
all
that
I
wish
,
be
to
find
my
proposal
agreeable
to
you
;
and
if
my
first
be
not
,
my
second
shall
be
,
if
I
can
but
know
what
you
wish
.
  
<EOS>
do
I
say
too
much
,
my
dear
parent
,
when
I
say
,
He
be
,
if
possible
,
kinder
and
kinder
?
 
<EOS>
o
the
blessed
man
!
<EOS>
how
my
heart
be
overwhelmed
with
his
goodness
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
my
dear
,
let
me
desire
you
to
mention
this
to
them
,
to
see
if
they
approve
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
it
be
your
choice
,
and
theirs
,
to
have
them
nearer
to
you
,
or
even
under
the
same
roof
with
you
,
I
will
freely
consent
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
o
no
,
sir
,
say
I
,
(
<EOS>
and
I
fear
almost
sin
in
my
grateful
flight
,
)
<EOS>
I
be
sure
they
would
not
choose
that
;
they
could
not
,
perhaps
,
serve
God
so
well
if
they
be
to
live
with
you
:
for
,
so
constantly
see
the
hand
that
bless
them
,
they
would
,
it
may
be
,
as
must
be
my
care
to
avoid
,
be
tempt
to
look
no
further
in
their
gratitude
,
than
to
the
dear
dispenser
of
such
innumerable
benefit
.
  
<EOS>
excellent
creature
!
<EOS>
say
he
:
<EOS>
My
beloved
want
no
language
,
nor
sentiment
neither
;
and
her
charming
thought
,
so
sweetly
express
,
would
grace
any
language
;
and
this
be
a
blessing
almost
peculiar
to
my
fair
.
 
<EOS>
Your
so
kind
acceptance
,
my
Pamela
,
add
he
,
repay
the
benefit
with
interest
,
and
leave
me
under
obligation
to
your
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
my
dear
,
I
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do
,
with
regard
to
point
of
your
own
private
charity
;
for
far
be
it
from
me
,
to
put
under
that
name
the
subject
we
have
be
mention
;
because
that
,
and
more
than
that
,
be
duty
to
person
so
worthy
,
and
so
nearly
related
to
my
Pamela
,
and
,
as
such
,
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
the
sweet
man
outdo
me
,
in
thought
,
word
,
power
,
and
every
thing
!
  
<EOS>
and
this
,
say
he
,
lie
in
very
small
compass
;
for
I
will
allow
you
two
hundred
pound
a
year
,
which
Longman
shall
constantly
pay
you
,
at
fifty
pound
a
quarter
,
for
your
own
use
,
and
<EOS>
of
which
I
expect
no
account
;
to
commence
from
the
day
you
enter
into
my
other
house
:
I
mean
,
say
he
,
that
the
first
fifty
pound
shall
then
be
due
;
because
you
shall
have
something
to
begin
with
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
add
the
dear
generous
man
,
if
this
be
pleasing
to
you
,
let
it
,
since
you
say
you
want
word
,
be
signify
by
such
a
sweet
kiss
as
you
give
me
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
hesitate
not
a
moment
to
comply
with
these
oblige
term
,
and
throw
my
arm
about
his
dear
neck
,
though
in
the
chariot
,
and
bless
his
goodness
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
can
not
bear
this
generous
treatment
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
say
,
do
not
be
uneasy
,
my
dear
,
about
these
trifle
:
<EOS>
God
have
bless
me
with
a
very
good
estate
,
and
all
of
it
in
a
prosperous
condition
,
and
generally
well
tenant
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
up
money
every
year
,
and
have
,
besides
,
large
sum
in
government
and
other
security
;
so
that
you
will
find
,
<EOS>
what
I
have
hitherto
promise
,
be
very
short
of
that
proportion
of
my
substance
,
which
,
as
my
dear
wife
,
you
have
a
right
to
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
sweet
manner
do
we
pass
our
time
till
evening
,
when
the
chariot
bring
us
home
;
and
then
our
supper
succeed
in
the
same
agreeable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
,
in
a
rapturous
circle
,
the
time
move
on
;
every
hour
bring
with
it
something
more
delightful
than
the
past
!
 
<EOS>
sure
nobody
be
ever
so
blest
as
I
!
  
<EOS>
Sunday
,
the
fourth
day
of
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
not
go
to
chapel
this
morning
,
the
reason
of
which
I
tell
you
,
I
bestow
the
time
,
from
the
hour
of
my
beloved
's
rise
,
to
breakfast
,
in
prayer
and
thanksgiving
,
in
my
closet
;
and
now
I
begin
to
be
quite
easy
,
cheerful
,
and
free
in
my
spirit
;
and
the
rather
,
as
I
find
myself
encourage
by
the
tranquillity
,
and
pleasing
vivacity
,
in
the
temper
and
behaviour
of
my
beloved
,
who
thereby
shew
he
do
not
repent
of
his
goodness
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
attend
him
to
breakfast
with
great
pleasure
and
freedom
,
and
he
seem
quite
pleased
with
me
,
and
say
,
now
do
my
dearest
begin
to
look
upon
me
with
an
air
of
serenity
and
satisfaction
:
it
shall
be
always
,
add
he
,
my
delight
to
give
you
occasion
for
this
sweet
become
aspect
of
confidence
and
pleasure
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
,
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
be
quite
easy
,
and
have
lose
all
its
foolish
tumult
,
which
,
combat
with
my
gratitude
,
may
give
an
unacceptable
appearance
to
my
behaviour
:
but
now
your
goodness
,
sir
,
have
enable
it
to
get
the
well
of
its
uneasy
apprehension
,
and
my
heart
be
all
of
one
piece
,
and
devote
to
you
,
and
grateful
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
and
could
I
be
so
happy
as
to
see
you
and
my
good
Lady
Davers
reconcile
<EOS>
,
I
have
nothing
in
this
world
to
wish
for
more
,
but
the
continuance
of
your
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
wish
this
reconciliation
,
my
dear
,
as
well
as
you
:
and
I
do
assure
you
,
more
for
your
sake
than
my
own
;
and
if
she
would
behave
tolerably
,
I
would
make
the
term
easy
to
her
,
for
that
reason
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
will
lay
down
one
rule
for
you
,
my
Pamela
,
to
observe
in
your
dress
;
and
I
will
tell
you
every
thing
I
like
or
dislike
,
as
it
occur
to
me
:
and
I
would
have
you
do
the
same
,
on
your
part
;
that
nothing
may
be
upon
either
of
our
mind
that
may
occasion
the
least
reservedness
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
observe
,
in
married
folk
,
that
,
in
a
little
while
,
the
lady
grow
careless
in
her
dress
;
which
,
to
me
,
look
as
if
she
would
take
no
pain
to
secure
the
affection
she
have
gain
;
and
shew
a
slight
to
her
husband
,
that
she
have
not
to
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
you
must
know
,
this
have
always
give
me
great
offence
;
and
I
should
not
forgive
it
,
even
in
my
Pamela
:
though
she
would
have
this
excuse
for
herself
,
that
thousand
could
not
make
,
that
she
look
lovely
in
every
thing
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
expect
of
you
always
to
be
dress
by
dinner
-
time
,
except
something
extraordinary
happen
;
and
this
,
whether
you
be
to
go
abroad
,
or
stay
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
,
my
love
,
will
continue
to
you
that
sweet
ease
in
your
dress
and
behaviour
,
which
you
be
so
happy
a
mistress
of
;
and
whomsoever
I
bring
home
with
me
to
my
table
,
you
will
be
in
readiness
to
receive
them
;
and
will
not
want
to
make
those
foolish
apology
to
unexpected
visitor
,
that
carry
with
them
a
reflection
on
the
conduct
of
those
who
make
them
;
and
,
besides
,
will
convince
me
,
that
you
think
yourself
oblige
to
appear
as
graceful
to
your
husband
,
as
you
would
to
person
less
familiar
to
your
sight
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
be
a
most
obliging
injunction
;
and
I
most
heartily
thank
you
for
it
,
and
will
always
take
care
to
obey
it
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
you
may
better
do
this
than
half
your
sex
;
because
they
too
generally
act
in
such
a
manner
,
as
if
they
seem
to
think
it
the
privilege
of
birth
and
fortune
,
to
turn
day
into
night
,
and
night
into
day
,
and
be
seldom
stirring
till
it
be
time
to
sit
down
to
dinner
;
and
so
all
the
good
old
family
rule
be
reverse
:
for
they
breakfast
,
when
they
should
dine
;
dine
,
when
they
should
sup
;
and
sup
,
when
they
should
go
to
bed
;
and
,
by
the
help
of
dear
quadrille
,
sometimes
go
to
bed
when
they
should
rise
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
thing
<EOS>
but
these
,
my
dear
,
continue
he
<EOS>
,
I
expect
you
to
be
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
good
mother
be
one
of
this
oldfashioned
cut
,
and
,
in
all
other
respect
,
as
worthy
a
lady
as
any
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
and
so
you
have
not
be
use
to
the
new
way
,
and
may
the
easy
practise
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
pray
give
me
more
of
your
sweet
injunction
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
continue
he
,
I
shall
,
in
the
usual
course
,
and
generally
,
if
not
hinder
by
company
,
like
to
go
to
bed
with
my
dear
by
eleven
;
and
,
if
I
do
not
,
shall
not
hinder
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
ordinarily
now
rise
by
six
in
summer
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
allow
you
to
be
half
an
hour
after
me
,
or
so
.
  
<EOS>
then
you
will
have
some
time
you
may
call
your
own
,
till
you
give
me
your
company
to
breakfast
;
which
may
be
always
so
,
as
that
we
may
have
do
at
a
little
after
nine
.
  
<EOS>
then
will
you
have
several
hour
again
at
your
disposal
,
till
two
o'clock
,
when
I
shall
like
to
sit
down
at
table
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
then
have
several
useful
hour
more
to
employ
yourself
in
,
as
you
shall
best
like
;
and
I
would
generally
go
to
supper
by
eight
;
and
when
we
be
resolve
to
stick
to
these
oldfashioned
rule
,
as
near
as
we
can
<EOS>
,
we
shall
have
our
visitor
conform
to
them
too
,
and
expect
them
from
us
,
and
suit
themselves
accordingly
:
<EOS>
for
I
have
always
observe
,
that
it
be
in
every
one
's
power
to
prescribe
rule
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
stand
a
few
ridiculous
jest
at
first
,
and
that
too
from
such
,
generally
,
as
be
not
the
most
worthy
to
be
minded
;
and
,
after
a
while
,
they
will
say
,
It
signify
nothing
to
ask
him
:
he
will
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
put
him
out
of
his
bias
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
regular
piece
of
clock
-
work
,
they
will
joke
,
and
all
that
:
<EOS>
and
why
,
my
dear
,
should
we
not
be
so
?
 
<EOS>
for
man
be
as
frail
a
piece
of
machinery
as
any
clock
-
work
whatever
;
and
,
by
irregularity
,
be
as
subject
to
be
disorder
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
my
dear
,
continue
the
charming
man
,
when
they
see
they
be
receive
,
at
my
own
time
,
with
an
open
countenance
and
cheerful
heart
;
when
they
see
plenty
and
variety
at
my
board
,
and
meet
a
kind
and
hearty
welcome
from
us
both
;
they
will
not
offer
to
break
in
upon
my
condition
,
nor
grudge
me
my
regular
hour
:
<EOS>
and
as
most
of
these
people
have
nothing
to
do
,
except
to
rise
in
a
morning
,
they
may
as
well
come
to
breakfast
with
us
at
half
an
hour
after
eight
,
in
summer
,
as
at
ten
or
eleven
;
to
dinner
at
two
,
as
at
four
,
five
,
or
six
;
and
to
supper
at
eight
,
as
at
ten
or
eleven
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
our
servant
,
too
,
will
know
,
generally
,
<EOS>
the
time
of
their
business
,
and
the
hour
of
their
leisure
or
recess
;
and
we
,
as
well
as
they
,
shall
reap
the
benefit
of
this
regularity
.
 
<EOS>
and
who
know
,
my
dear
,
but
we
may
revive
the
good
oldfashion
in
our
neighbourhood
,
by
this
means
?
 
<EOS>
at
least
it
will
be
do
our
part
towards
it
;
and
answer
the
good
lesson
I
learn
at
school
,
every
one
mend
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
bad
that
will
happen
will
be
,
that
when
some
of
my
brother
rake
,
such
as
those
who
break
in
upon
us
,
so
unwelcomely
,
last
Thursday
,
be
get
out
of
the
way
,
if
that
can
ever
be
,
and
begin
to
consider
who
they
shall
go
to
dine
with
in
their
ramble
<EOS>
,
they
will
only
say
,
We
must
not
go
to
him
,
for
his
dinner
-
time
be
over
;
and
so
they
will
reserve
me
for
another
time
,
when
they
happen
to
suit
it
better
;
or
,
perhaps
,
they
will
take
a
supper
and
a
bed
with
me
instead
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
continue
the
kind
man
,
you
see
here
be
more
of
my
injunction
,
as
you
call
them
;
and
though
I
will
not
be
so
set
,
as
to
quarrel
,
if
they
be
not
always
exactly
comply
with
;
yet
,
<EOS>
as
I
know
you
will
not
think
them
unreasonable
,
I
shall
be
glad
they
may
,
as
often
as
they
can
;
and
you
will
give
your
order
accordingly
to
your
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
be
a
good
woman
,
and
will
take
pleasure
in
obey
you
.
  
<EOS>
o
dear
,
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
have
you
nothing
more
to
honour
me
with
?
<EOS>
You
oblige
and
improve
me
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
happy
lot
be
mine
!
  
<EOS>
why
,
let
me
see
,
my
dear
,
say
he
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
of
no
more
at
present
:
for
it
would
be
needless
to
say
how
much
I
value
you
for
your
natural
sweetness
of
temper
,
and
that
open
cheerfulness
of
countenance
,
which
adorn
you
,
when
nothing
have
give
my
fair
apprehension
for
her
virtue
:
a
sweetness
,
and
a
cheerfulness
,
that
prepossess
in
your
favour
,
at
first
sight
,
the
mind
of
every
one
that
behold
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
say
,
that
I
would
have
you
diligently
preserve
this
sweet
appearance
:
let
no
thwart
accident
,
no
cross
fortune
,
(
for
we
must
not
expect
to
be
exempt
from
such
,
happy
as
we
now
be
in
each
other
!
)
<EOS>
deprive
this
sweet
face
of
this
its
principal
grace
:
<EOS>
and
when
any
thing
unplease
happen
,
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
farth
,
begin
to
mistrust
yourself
,
and
apply
to
your
glass
;
and
if
you
see
a
gloom
arising
,
or
arise
,
banish
it
instantly
;
smooth
your
dear
countenance
;
resume
your
former
composure
;
and
then
,
my
dear
,
whose
heart
must
always
be
see
in
her
face
,
and
can
not
be
a
hypocrite
,
will
find
this
a
means
to
smooth
her
passion
also
:
<EOS>
and
if
the
occasion
be
too
strong
for
so
sudden
a
conquest
,
she
will
know
how
to
do
it
more
effectually
,
by
repair
to
her
closet
,
and
beg
that
gracious
assistance
,
which
have
never
yet
fail
her
:
<EOS>
and
so
shall
I
,
my
dear
,
who
,
as
you
once
but
too
justly
observe
,
have
be
too
much
indulge
by
my
good
mother
,
have
an
example
from
you
,
as
well
as
a
pleasure
in
you
,
which
will
never
be
pal
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
,
continue
he
<EOS>
,
I
have
frequently
observe
at
the
house
of
many
a
gentleman
,
that
when
we
have
unexpectedly
visit
,
or
break
in
upon
the
family
order
lay
down
by
the
lady
;
and
especially
if
any
of
us
have
lie
under
the
suspicion
of
have
occasionally
seduce
our
married
companion
into
bad
hour
,
or
give
indifferent
example
,
the
poor
gentleman
have
be
oddly
affect
at
our
come
;
though
the
good
breeding
of
the
lady
have
make
her
just
keep
up
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
look
so
conscious
;
have
be
so
afraid
,
as
it
be
,
to
disoblige
;
have
make
so
many
excuse
for
some
of
us
,
before
we
have
be
accuse
,
as
have
always
shew
me
how
unwelcome
we
have
be
;
and
how
much
he
be
oblige
to
compound
with
his
lady
for
a
tolerable
reception
of
us
;
and
,
perhaps
,
she
too
,
in
proportion
to
the
honest
man
's
concern
to
court
her
smile
,
have
be
more
reserve
,
stiff
,
and
formal
;
and
have
behave
with
an
indifference
and
slight
that
have
often
make
me
wish
myself
out
of
her
house
;
for
too
plainly
have
I
see
that
it
be
not
his
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
my
dear
,
you
will
judge
,
by
my
description
,
have
afford
me
subject
for
animadversion
upon
the
married
life
;
for
a
man
may
not
(
though
,
in
the
main
,
he
be
willing
to
flatter
himself
that
he
be
master
of
his
house
,
and
will
assert
his
prerogative
upon
great
occasion
,
when
it
be
strongly
invaded
)
be
always
willing
to
contend
;
and
such
woman
as
those
I
have
describe
,
be
always
ready
to
take
the
field
,
and
be
bad
enemy
than
the
old
Parthians
,
who
annoy
most
when
they
seem
to
retreat
;
and
never
fail
to
return
to
the
charge
again
,
and
carry
on
the
offensive
war
,
till
they
have
tire
out
resistance
,
and
make
the
husband
willing
,
like
a
vanquished
enemy
,
to
compound
for
small
matter
,
in
order
to
preserve
something
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
the
poor
man
do
not
care
to
let
his
friend
see
his
case
;
and
so
will
not
provoke
a
fire
to
break
out
,
that
he
see
(
and
so
do
his
friend
too
)
<EOS>
the
meek
lady
have
much
ado
to
smother
;
and
which
,
very
possibly
,
burn
with
a
most
comfortable
ardour
,
after
we
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
You
smile
,
my
Pamela
,
say
he
,
at
this
whimsical
picture
;
and
,
I
be
sure
,
I
never
shall
have
reason
to
include
you
in
these
disagreeable
outline
;
but
yet
I
will
say
,
that
I
expect
from
you
,
whoever
come
to
my
house
,
that
you
accustom
yourself
to
one
even
,
uniform
complaisance
:
that
no
frown
take
place
on
your
brow
:
<EOS>
that
however
ill
or
well
provide
we
may
be
for
their
reception
,
you
shew
<EOS>
no
flutter
or
discomposure
:
<EOS>
that
whoever
you
may
have
in
your
company
at
the
time
,
you
signify
not
,
by
the
least
reserved
look
,
that
the
stranger
be
come
upon
you
unseasonably
,
or
at
a
time
you
wish
he
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
facetious
,
kind
,
oblige
to
all
;
and
,
if
to
one
more
than
another
,
to
such
as
have
the
least
reason
to
expect
it
from
you
,
or
who
be
most
inferior
at
the
table
;
for
thus
will
you
,
my
Pamela
,
cheer
the
doubt
mind
,
quiet
the
uneasy
heart
,
and
diffuse
ease
,
pleasure
,
and
tranquillity
,
around
my
board
.
  
<EOS>
and
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
continue
he
<EOS>
,
let
no
little
accident
ruffle
your
temper
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
once
that
I
be
at
Lady
Arthur
's
;
and
a
footman
happen
to
stumble
,
and
let
fall
a
fine
china
dish
,
and
break
it
all
to
piece
<EOS>
:
It
be
grievous
to
see
the
uneasiness
it
give
the
poor
lady
:
<EOS>
and
she
be
so
sincere
in
it
,
that
she
suffer
it
to
spread
all
over
the
company
;
and
it
be
a
pretty
large
one
too
;
and
not
a
person
in
it
but
turn
either
her
consoler
,
or
fall
into
story
of
the
like
misfortune
;
and
so
we
all
become
,
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
<EOS>
nothing
but
blunder
footman
,
and
careless
servant
,
or
be
turn
into
broken
jar
,
plate
,
glass
,
tea
-
cup
,
and
such
like
brittle
substance
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
affect
me
so
much
,
that
,
when
I
come
home
,
I
go
to
bed
,
and
dreamt
,
that
Robin
,
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
,
break
the
fore
glass
of
my
chariot
;
and
I
be
so
solicitous
,
methought
,
to
keep
the
good
lady
in
countenance
for
her
anger
,
that
I
break
his
head
in
revenge
,
and
stab
one
of
my
coach
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
and
all
the
comfort
I
have
when
it
be
do
,
methought
,
be
,
that
I
have
not
expose
myself
before
company
;
and
there
be
no
sufferer
,
but
guilty
Robin
,
and
one
innocent
coach
-
horse
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
divert
with
the
facetious
hint
,
and
the
pleasant
manner
in
which
he
give
them
;
and
I
promise
to
improve
by
the
excellent
lesson
contain
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
go
up
and
dress
myself
,
as
like
a
bride
as
I
could
,
in
my
good
clothe
;
and
,
on
inquiry
,
hear
my
dear
master
be
go
to
walk
in
the
garden
<EOS>
,
I
go
to
find
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
read
in
the
little
alcove
;
and
I
say
,
Sir
,
be
I
license
to
intrude
upon
you
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
because
you
can
not
intrude
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
wholly
yours
,
<EOS>
that
,
wherever
I
be
,
you
have
not
only
a
right
to
join
me
,
but
you
do
me
a
very
acceptable
favour
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
sir
,
say
I
,
obey
your
first
kind
injunction
,
as
to
dress
myself
before
dinner
;
but
may
be
you
be
busy
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
up
the
paper
he
be
read
,
and
say
,
I
can
have
no
business
or
pleasure
of
equal
value
to
your
company
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
you
go
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
only
,
sir
,
to
know
if
you
have
any
more
kind
injunction
to
give
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
hear
you
talk
a
whole
day
together
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
very
obliging
,
Pamela
,
say
he
;
but
you
be
so
perfectly
what
I
wish
,
that
I
may
have
spare
those
I
give
you
;
but
I
be
willing
you
should
have
a
taste
of
my
freedom
with
you
,
to
put
you
upon
the
like
with
me
:
<EOS>
for
I
be
confident
there
can
be
no
friendship
last
,
without
freedom
,
and
without
communicate
to
one
another
even
the
little
caprice
,
if
my
Pamela
can
have
any
such
,
which
may
occasion
uneasiness
to
either
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
be
so
kind
as
to
find
some
fault
with
me
,
and
tell
me
what
you
would
wish
me
to
do
,
to
appear
more
agreeable
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
and
I
could
have
kiss
him
,
but
for
shame
,
(
to
be
sure
I
shall
grow
a
sad
fond
hussy
,
)
<EOS>
I
have
not
one
single
thing
to
wish
for
;
no
,
not
one
!
 
<EOS>
He
salute
me
very
kindly
,
and
say
,
He
should
be
sorry
if
I
have
,
and
forbore
to
speak
it
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
that
your
Pamela
have
no
conscience
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
that
because
you
so
kindly
oblige
her
,
and
delight
in
oblige
her
,
that
she
must
rack
her
invention
for
trial
of
your
goodness
,
and
know
not
when
she
be
happy
?
 
<EOS>
o
my
dear
sir
,
add
I
,
less
than
one
half
of
the
favour
you
have
so
generously
confer
upon
me
,
would
have
exceed
my
utmost
wish
!
  
<EOS>
My
dear
angel
,
say
he
,
and
kiss
me
again
,
I
shall
be
troublesome
to
you
with
my
kiss
,
if
you
continue
thus
sweetly
oblige
in
your
action
and
expression
.
 
<EOS>
O
sir
,
say
I
,
I
have
be
think
,
as
I
be
dress
myself
,
what
excellent
lesson
you
teach
me
!
  
<EOS>
when
you
command
me
,
at
your
table
to
cheer
the
doubt
mind
and
comfort
the
uneasy
heart
,
and
to
behave
most
kindly
to
those
who
have
least
reason
to
expect
it
,
and
be
most
inferior
;
how
sweetly
,
in
every
instance
that
could
possibly
occur
,
have
you
do
this
yourself
by
your
poor
,
unworthy
Pamela
,
till
you
have
diffuse
,
in
your
own
dear
word
,
ease
,
pleasure
,
and
tranquillity
,
around
my
glad
heart
!
  
<EOS>
then
again
,
sir
,
when
you
bid
me
not
be
disturb
by
little
accident
,
or
by
stranger
come
in
upon
me
unexpectedly
,
how
noble
an
instance
do
you
give
me
of
this
,
when
,
on
our
happy
wedding
-
day
,
the
coming
of
Sir
Charles
Hargrave
,
and
the
other
two
gentleman
,
(
for
which
you
be
quite
unprovided
,
and
which
hinder
our
happiness
of
dining
together
on
that
choose
day
,
)
do
not
so
disturb
you
,
but
that
you
entertain
the
gentleman
pleasantly
,
and
part
with
them
civilly
and
kindly
!
 
<EOS>
what
charming
instance
be
these
,
I
have
be
recollect
with
pleasure
,
of
your
pursue
the
doctrine
you
deliver
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
,
say
he
,
these
observation
be
very
kind
in
you
,
and
much
to
my
advantage
:
<EOS>
but
if
I
do
not
always
(
for
I
fear
these
be
too
much
accident
)
so
well
pursue
the
doctrine
I
lie
down
,
my
Pamela
must
not
expect
that
my
imperfection
will
be
a
plea
for
her
nonobservance
of
my
lesson
,
as
you
call
them
;
for
,
I
doubt
I
shall
never
be
half
so
perfect
as
you
;
and
so
I
can
not
permit
you
to
recede
in
your
goodness
,
though
I
may
find
myself
unable
to
advance
as
I
ought
in
my
duty
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
sir
,
say
I
,
by
God
's
grace
,
I
never
shall
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
,
say
he
;
but
I
only
mention
this
,
know
my
own
defect
,
lest
my
future
lesson
should
not
be
so
well
warrant
by
my
practice
,
as
in
the
instance
you
have
kindly
recollect
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
take
notice
of
my
dress
;
and
span
my
waist
with
his
hand
,
say
,
what
a
sweet
shape
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
make
one
regret
to
lose
it
;
and
yet
,
my
beloved
Pamela
,
I
shall
think
nothing
but
that
loss
wanting
,
to
complete
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
my
bold
hand
before
his
mouth
,
and
say
,
Hush
,
hush
!
 
<EOS>
o
fie
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
the
free
thing
you
have
ever
yet
say
,
since
I
have
be
yours
!
 
<EOS>
He
kiss
my
hand
,
and
say
,
such
an
innocent
wish
,
my
dear
,
may
be
permit
me
,
because
it
be
the
end
of
the
institution
.
 
<EOS>
but
say
,
Would
such
a
case
be
unwelcome
to
my
Pamela
?
  
<EOS>
I
will
say
,
sir
,
say
I
,
and
hide
my
blush
face
on
his
bosom
,
that
your
wish
,
in
every
thing
,
shall
be
mine
;
but
,
pray
,
sir
,
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
kindly
salute
me
,
and
thank
me
,
and
change
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
too
free
,
I
hope
.
  
<EOS>
thus
we
talk
,
till
we
hear
the
coach
;
and
then
he
say
,
stay
here
,
in
the
garden
,
my
dear
,
and
I
will
bring
the
company
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
be
go
,
I
pass
by
the
back
-
door
,
kneel
down
against
it
,
and
bless
God
for
not
permit
my
then
so
much
desire
escape
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
pond
,
and
kneel
down
on
the
mossy
bank
,
and
again
bless
God
there
,
for
his
mercy
in
my
escape
from
myself
,
my
then
bad
enemy
,
though
I
think
I
have
none
but
enemy
,
and
no
friend
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
ought
to
do
in
almost
every
step
of
this
garden
,
and
every
room
in
this
house
!
  
<EOS>
and
I
be
bend
my
step
to
the
dear
little
chapel
,
to
make
my
acknowledgment
there
;
but
I
see
the
company
come
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
say
,
so
,
Miss
Andrews
,
how
do
you
do
now
?
 
<EOS>
o

so
sweetly
,
so
pleased

that
I
know
you
will
let
me
dance
at
your
wedding
,
for
I
shall
long
to
be
there
!
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
be
pleased
to
say
I
look
like
an
angel
:
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Peters
say
,
I
improve
upon
them
every
time
they
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Lady

be
also
pleased
to
make
me
a
fine
compliment
,
and
say

I
look
free
and
easy
every
time
she
see
me
.
<EOS>
dear
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
<EOS>
think
I
,
you
would
spare
these
compliment
;
for
I
shall
have
some
joke
,
I
doubt
,
pass
on
me
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
,
that
will
make
me
suffer
for
all
these
fine
thing

<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
say

softly

and
hold
it
with
both
his
,
and
make
a
very
free
jest
,
by
way
of
compliment
,
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
think
a
young
rake
be
hardly
tolerable
;
but
an
old
rake
,
and
an
old
beau
,
be
two
very
sad
thing
!
  
<EOS>
and
all
this
before

above
these

if

<EOS>
and
so

<EOS>
I
be

for

and
seem
highly
pleased

<EOS>
nobody

<EOS>
no

say
Lady

very
obligingly

for
,
with
such
a
peerless
spouse
,

no
good

<EOS>
and

and
when

say
,
before
them
all
,
now
,
my
sweet

for
here
I
begin

and
here
I

but
not

.
  
<EOS>
this
be
sweetly
say
,
and
take
great
notice
of
;
and
it
be
do
credit
to
his
own
generous
choice
,
and
vastly
more
than
I
merit
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
force
to
stand
many
more
joke
afterwards
:
for
Sir

say

several
time
,
come

come

I
will
assure

.
  
<EOS>
when
we

,
I
make
no
difficulty
of
what
all
offer

,
the
upper
end
of
the
table
;
and
perform
the
honour
of
it
with
pretty
tolerable
presence
of
mind
,
consider
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
with
much
ado
,
my
good
benefactor
promise
to
be
down
again
before
winter
,
we
get
off
the
ball
;
but
appoint
Tuesday

at

who
promise

to
set
out
on
Wednesday
morning
for
Bedfordshire
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
prayer
in
the
little
chapel

in
the
afternoon
;
but
they
all
wish
for
the
good

,
with
great
encomium
upon

and

and
depart
exceed
well
satisfied
,
and
with
abundance
of
wish

the
continuance
of
our
mutual
happiness
;
and
my
master
desire
Mr.
Peters
to
answer
for
him
to
the
ringer
at
the
town
,
if
they
should
hear
of
it
;
till
our
return
into
this
country
;
and
that
then
he
would
be
bountiful
to
them
,
because
he
would
not
publicly
declare
it
till
he
have
first
do
so
in
Bedfordshire
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
,
the
fifth
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
very
little
of
my
dear
friend
's
company
this
day
;
for
he
only
staid
breakfast
with
me
,
and
ride
out
to
see
a
sick
gentleman
about
eighteen
mile
off
,
who
beg
(
by
a
man
and
horse
on
purpose
)
to
speak
with
him
,
believe
he
should
not
recover
,
and
upon
part
of
whose
estate
my
master
have
a
mortgage
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
My
dearest
,
I
shall
be
very
uneasy
,
if
I
be
oblige
to
tarry
all
night
from
you
;
but
,
lest
you
should
be
alarm
,
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
come
home
by
ten
,
do
not
expect
me
:
for
poor
Mr.
Carlton
and
I
have
pretty
large
concern
together
;
and
if
he
should
be
very
ill
,
and
would
be
comfort
by
my
presence
,
(
as
I
know
he
love
me
,
and
his
family
will
be
more
in
my
power
,
if
he
die
,
than
I
wish
for
,
)
charity
will
not
let
me
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
and
I
fear
he
will
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
for
the
sake
of
his
poor
sick
friend
,
who
,
I
doubt
,
be
bad
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
know
not
the
gentleman
,
I
be
sorry
for
his
own
sake
,
for
his
family
's
sake
,
and
for
my
dear
master
's
sake
,
who
,
by
his
kind
expression
,
I
find
,
love
him
:
<EOS>
and
,
methink
,
I
should
be
sorry
any
grief
should
touch
his
generous
heart
;
though
yet
there
be
no
living
in
this
world
,
without
too
many
occasion
for
concern
,
even
in
the
most
prosperous
state
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
fit
it
should
be
so
;
or
else
<EOS>
,
poor
wretch
,
as
we
be
!
<EOS>
we
should
look
no
farther
,
but
be
like
sensual
traveller
on
a
journey
homeward
,
who
,
meet
with
good
entertainment
at
some
inn
on
the
way
,
put
up
their
rest
there
,
and
never
think
of
pursue
their
journey
to
their
proper
home
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
I
remember
,
be
often
a
reflection
of
my
good
lady
's
,
to
whom
I
owe
it
.
  
<EOS>
eleven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
be
with
me
,
and
ask
if
I
will
have
her
for
a
bed
-
fellow
,
in
want
of
a
well
?
 
<EOS>
I
thank
her
;
but
I
say
,
I
would
see
how
it
be
to
be
by
myself
one
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
mention
,
that
I
make
Mrs.
Jewkes
dine
and
sup
with
me
;
and
she
be
much
pleased
with
it
,
and
my
behaviour
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
could
see
,
by
her
manner
,
that
she
be
a
little
strike
inwardly
at
some
of
her
former
conduct
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
it
be
much
,
I
fear
,
because
I
be
what
I
be
;
for
she
have
otherwise
very
little
remorse
,
I
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Her
talk
and
action
be
entirely
different
from
what
they
use
to
be
,
quite
circumspect
and
decent
;
and
I
should
have
think
her
virtuous
,
and
even
pious
,
have
I
never
know
her
in
another
light
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
we
may
see
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
of
what
force
example
be
,
and
what
be
in
the
power
of
the
head
of
family
to
do
:
and
this
shews
,
that
evil
example
,
in
superior
,
be
doubly
pernicious
,
and
doubly
culpable
,
because
such
person
be
bad
themselves
,
and
not
only
do
no
good
,
but
much
harm
to
other
;
and
the
condemnation
of
such
must
,

<EOS>
if
my
love

not
be
troublesome
and
impertinent
,
I
should
be
nothing
else
;
for
I
have
a
true
grateful
spirit
;
and
I
have
need
to

<EOS>
Tuesday

o'clock

<EOS>
My
dear
,
dear
 
master
(
I
be
sure
I
should
still
say
;
<EOS>
but
I
will
learn
to
rise
to
a
soft
epithet
,
now
-
and
-
then
)
be
not
yet
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he

safe
and
well
!
 
<EOS>
so
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
<EOS>
I
go
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
do
nothing
but
talk
and
think
of
him
,
and
all
his
kindness
to
me
,
and
to
you
,
which
be
still
me
,
more
intimately
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
receive
a
letter
from
him
,
which
he
write
overnight
,
as
I
find
by
it
,
and
send
early
this

.
 
<EOS>

of
it

ANDREWS
  
"
<EOS>
my
dearest
PAMELA
,
                             
Monday
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
my
not
come
home
this
night
will
not
frighten
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
I
can
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
friend
be
so
very
ill
,
<EOS>
that
I
doubt
he
can
not
recover
.
 
<EOS>
His
desire
to
have
me
stay
with
him
be
so
strong
,
that
I
shall
sit
up
all
night
with
him
,
as
it
be
now
near
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
for
he
can
not
bear
me
out
of
his
sight
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
make
him
and
his
distressed
wife
and
child
so
easy
,
in
the
kind
assurance
I
could
give
him
of
my
consideration
for
him
and
them
,
that
I
be
look
upon
(
as
the
poor
disconsolate
widow
,
as
she
,
I
doubt
,
will
soon
be
,
tell
me
,
)
as
their
good
angel
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wish
we
have
not
engage
to
the
good
neighbourhood
at
Sir
Simon
's
for
to
-
morrow
night
;
but
I
be
so
desirous
to
set
out
on
Wednesday
for
the
other
house
,
that
,
as
well
as
in
return
for
the
civility
of
so
many
good
friend
,
who
will
be
there
on
purpose
,
I
would
not
put
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
beg
of
you
,
therefore
,
my
dear
,
be
,
that
you
would
go
in
the
chariot
to
Sir
Simon
's
,
the
sooner
in
the
day
the
well
,
because
you
will
be
divert
with
the
company
,
who
all
so
much
admire
you
;
and
I
hope
to
join
you
there
by
your
tea
-
time
in
the
afternoon
,
which
will
be
well
than
go
home
,
and
return
with
you
,
as
it
will
be
six
mile
difference
to
me
;
and
I
know
the
good
company
will
excuse
my
dress
,
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
count
every
hour
of
this
little
absence
for
a
day
:
for
I
be
,
with
the
utmost
sincerity
,
                                 
"
<EOS>
My
dear
love
,
for
ever
your
,
etc
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
could
go
to
dine
with
them
,
it
will
be
a
freedom
that
would
be
very
pleasing
to
them
;
and
the
more
,
as
they
do
not
expect
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
have
a
little
concern
,
lest
his
fatigue
should
be
too
great
,
and
for
the
poor
sick
gentleman
and
family
;
but
tell
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
that
the
least
intimation
of
his
choice
should
be
a
command
to
me
,
and
so
I
would
go
to
dinner
there
;
and
order
the
chariot
to
be
get
ready
to
carry
me
:
when
a
messenger
come
up
,
just
as
I
be
dress
,
to
tell
her
she
must
come
down
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
at
the
window
,
that
visitor
be
come

for
there
be
a
chariot
and
six
horse
,
the
company
go
out
of
it
,
and
three
footman
on
horseback
;
and
I
think
the
chariot
have
coronet
.
<EOS>
who
can
it
be
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
but
here
I
will

soon

<EOS>
Pray

<EOS>
so

discompose
for
any
body
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
I
,
but
who
can
help
constitution
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
would
no
more
be
so
discompose
,
that
I
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
,
indeed
,
madam
,
if
it
be
to
me
,
I
would
put
on
an
air
as
mistress
of
the
house
,
as
you
be
,
and
go
and
salute
her
ladyship
,
and
bid
her
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
reply
I
,
fine
talking
!
 
<EOS>
but
how
unlucky
this
be
,
your
good
master
be
not
at
home
!
  
<EOS>
what
answer
shall
I
give
her
,
say
she
,
to
her
desire
to
see
you
?
 
<EOS>
tell
her
,
say
I
,
I
be
sick
a
-
bed
;
I
be
die
,
and
must
not
be
disturb
;
I
be
go
out
 
or
any
thing
.
  
<EOS>
but
her
woman
come
up
to
me
just
as
I
have
utter
this
,
and
say
,
how
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Pamela
?
 
<EOS>
My
lady
desire
to
speak
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
must
go
.
  
<EOS>
sure
she
will
not
beat
me
!
 
<EOS>
oh
that
my
dear
protector
be
at
home
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
now
I
will
tell
you
all
that
happen
in
this
frightful
interview
.
  
<EOS>
a
nd
very
bad
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
down
,
dress
as
I
be
,
and
my
glove
on
,
and
my
fan
in
my
hand
,
to
be
just
ready
to
step
into
the
chariot
,
when
I
could
get
away
;
and
I
think
all
my
tremble
fit
have
be
over
now
;
but
I
be
mistaken
;
for
I
tremble
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
yet
resolve
to
put
on
as
good
an
air
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
the
parlour
,
and
say
,
make
a
very
low
courtesy
,
Your
servant
,
my
good
lady
!
 
<EOS>
and
your
servant
again
,
say
she
,
my
lady
,
for
I
think
you
be
dress
out
like
one
.
  
<EOS>
a
charming
girl
,
though
!
<EOS>
say
her
rakish
nephew
,
and
swear
a
great
oath
:
<EOS>
dear
aunt
,
forgive
me
,
but
I
must
kiss
her
;
and
be
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
Forbear
,
uncivil
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
use
freely
.
 
<EOS>
Jackey
,
say
my
lady
,
sit
down
,
and
do
not
touch
the
creature
 
<EOS>
She
be
proud
enough
already
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
difference
in
her
air
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
,
since
I
see
her
last
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
child
,
say
she
,
sneeringly
,
how
dost
find
thyself
?
 
<EOS>
Thou'rt
mightily
come
on
,
of
late
!
 
<EOS>
I
hear
strange
report
about
thee
!
 
<EOS>
Thou'rt
almost
get
into
fool
's
paradise
,
I
doubt
!
 
<EOS>
and
wilt
find
thyself
terribly
mistaken
in
a
little
while
<EOS>
,
if
thou
thinkest
my
brother
will
disgrace
his
family
,
to
humour
thy
baby
-
face
!
  
<EOS>
I
see
,
say
I
,
sadly
vexed
,
(
her
woman
and
nephew
smile
by
,
)
<EOS>
your
ladyship
have
no
very
important
command
for
me
;
and
I
beg
leave
to
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
Beck
,
say
she
to
her
woman
,
shut
the
door
,
my
young
lady
<EOS>
and
I
must
not
have
do
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
where
be
your
well
-
mannered
deceiver
go
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
,
when
your
ladyship
be
pleased
to
speak
intelligibly
,
I
shall
know
how
to
answer
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
my
dear
child
,
say
she
,
in
drollery
,
do
not
be
too
pert
<EOS>
neither
,
I
beseech
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
not
find
thy
master
's
sister
half
so
ready
to
take
thy
freedom
,
as
thy
mannerly
master
be
!
 
<EOS>
so
,
a
little
of
that
modesty
and
humility
that
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
use
to
shew
,
will
become
thee
well
than
the
air
thou
giv
thyself
,
since
my
mother
's
son
have
teach
thee
to
forget
thyself
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
beg
,
say
I
,
one
favour
of
your
ladyship
,
that
if
you
would
have
me
keep
my
distance
,
you
will
not
forget
your
own
degree
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
suppose
,
Miss
Pert
,
I
should
forget
my
degree
,
wouldst
thou
not
keep
thy
distance
then
?
  
<EOS>
if
you
,
madam
,
say
I
,
lessen
the
distance
yourself
<EOS>
,
you
will
descend
to
my
level
,
and
make
an
equality
,
which
I
do
not
presume
to
think
of
;
for
I
can
not
descend
low
than
I
be
 
at
least
in
your
ladyship
's
esteem
!
  
<EOS>
do
I
not
tell
you
,
Jackey
,
say
she
,
that
I
should
have
a
wit
to
talk
to
?
 
<EOS>
He
,
who
swear
like
a
fine
gentleman
at
every
word
,
rap
out
an
oath
,
and
say
,
drolle
,
I
think
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
say
so
<EOS>
,
you
should
know
you
be
speak
to
Lady
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
hope
there
be
no
need
of
your
information
,
and
so
I
can
not
thank
you
for
it
;
and
be
sorry
you
seem
to
think
it
want
an
oath
to
convince
me
of
the
truth
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
more
foolish
than
I
,
at
this
,
if
possible
,
not
expect
such
a
reprimand
.
 
<EOS>
and
say
,
at
last
,
why
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
you
put
me
half
out
of
countenance
with
your
witty
reproof
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
seem
quite
a
fine
gentleman

<EOS>

<EOS>
and
I

<EOS>
Her

softly
,
Mrs.

madam

<EOS>
and
how
be
you
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
chariot
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
must
be
a
lady
in
time
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
would
become
a
chariot
mighty
well
,
child
!
 
<EOS>
be
you
ever
out
in
it
with
your
master
?
  
<EOS>
pray
,
your
ladyship
,
say
I
,
a
little
too
pertly
,
perhaps
,
be
pleased
to
ask
half
a
dozen
such
question
together
;
because
one
answer
may
do
for
all
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
bold
-
face
,
say
she
,
you
will
forget
your
distance
,
and
bring
me
to
your
level
before
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
no
longer
refrain
tear
,
but
say
,
pray
your

,
let
me
ask
what
I
have
do
,
to
be
thus
severely
treat
?
 
<EOS>
I
never

any
harm

<EOS>
and
if
you
think
I
be
deceive
,
as
you
be
pleased
to
hint
,
I
should
be
more
entitled
to
your
pity
,
than
your
anger
.
  
<EOS>
She
rise
,
and
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
me
to
her
chair
;
and
then
sit
down
;
and
still
hold
my
hand
,
say
,
why
Pamela
,
I
do
indeed
pity
you
while
I
think
you
innocent
;
and
when
my
brother
seize
you
,
and
bring
you
down
hither
,
without
your
consent
,
I
be
concerned
for
you
;
and
I
be
still
more
concerned
for
you
,
and
love
you
,
when
I
hear
of
your
virtue
and
resistance
,
and
your
laudable
effort
to
get
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
,
as
I
fear
,
you
have
suffer
yourself
to
be
prevail
upon
,
and
have
lose
your
innocence
,
and
add
another
to
the
number
of
the
fool
he
have
ruin
,
(
this
shock
me
a
little
,
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
shew
my
displeasure
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Madam

reply
I
,
I
must
beg
no
hasty
judgment
;
I
have
not

my
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
take
care
,
take
care
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
say
she
:
do
not
lose
your
veracity
,
as
well
as
your
honour
!
 
<EOS>
why
be
you
here
,
when
you
be
at
full
liberty
to
go
whither
you
please
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
one
proposal
to
you
,
and
if
you
be
innocent
,
I
be
sure
you
will
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
go
and
live
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
instantly
set
out
with
you
in
my
chariot
,
and
not
stay
half
an
hour
longer
in
this
house
,
if
you
will
go
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
if
you
be
innocent
,
and
willing
to
keep
so
,
deny
me
,
if
you
can

<EOS>
I

I

and
yet
I
can

<EOS>

very
mannerly
,
Thou
liest
,
child
,
that
be
all
:
and
I

<EOS>
and
so

,
and

about
the
room
in
great
wrath
.

<EOS>
I
would
have

but
her
nephew
come
and
sit
in

.
 
<EOS>

be
raise
to

though
I
be
afraid
to
own
it
,
if

and
I
say

in

me
a

<EOS>
do
you

<EOS>
reply
I
<EOS>
:
if
that
be
the
answer
of
a
gentleman
to
such
an
one
as
I
,
it
would
not
,
I
dare
say
,
be
the

to
a

.
 
<EOS>
My

<EOS>

say
I
,
I
be
of
a
sex
that
give

and
you
think

or
you

not
give
this
occasion
for
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
say
my
lady

do
not

<EOS>
Pamela

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I

but
I
beg

<EOS>
I
will
hear

say
she

<EOS>
why

then

answer
I
,
I
should
perhaps
have
less
reason
to

this
gentleman
,
than
where
I
be

<EOS>
well
then
,
say
she

I
will
put

to
another
trial

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

and
it

thus
:
I
have
no
occasion
to
be
behold
to
your

for
this
honour
;
for
I
be
to
set
out
to
-
morrow
morning
on
the
way
to
my
parent
.
 
<EOS>
now
again
thou

<EOS>

if

can
use
me
thus
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
can
expect
no
answer
;
and
my
sex
,
and
my
tender
year
,
may
exempt
me
from
such
treatment
,
from
a
person
of
your

birth
and
quality
,
and
who

be
the
distance
ever
so
great

<EOS>
dost

,
my
friend
,
that

?
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
poor
innocent
,

a
fine
exchange
,
<EOS>
hast

not
?
 
<EOS>
Thy

?
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
will
warrant
,
<EOS>
my

<EOS>

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
Pr'ythee

child
,
walk
before
me
to
that
glass
;
survey
thyself
,
and
cone
back
to
me
,
that
I
may
see
how
finely
thou
can'st
act
the
theatrical
part
give
thee
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
then
resolve
to
try
to
be
silent
,
although
most
sadly
vexed
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
and
sit
me
down
in
the
window
,
and
she
take
her
place
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
;
and
her
saucy
Jackey
,
fleering
at
me
most
provokingly
,
sit
down
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
Shall
not
the
bride
sit
down
by
us
,
madam
?
<EOS>
ay
,
well
think
of
!
<EOS>
say
my
lady
:
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mrs.
Bride
,
your
pardon
for
sit
down
in
your
place
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
say
she
,
with
a
poor
pun
,
Thou
hast
some
modesty
,
however
,
child
!
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
thou
can'st
not
stand
it
,
so
must
sit
down
,
though
in
my
presence
!
 
<EOS>
I
still
keep
my
seat
,
and
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Thought
<EOS>
I
,
this
be
a
sad
thing
,
that
I
be
hinder
too
from
shew
my
duty
where
it
be
most
due
,
and
shall
have
anger
there
too
,
<EOS>
may
be
,
if
my
dear
master
should
be
there
before
me
!
 
<EOS>
so
she
eat
some
soup
,
as
do
her
kinsman
;
and
then
,
as
she
be
cut
up
a
fowl
,
say
,
if
thou
longest
,
my
little
dear
,
I
will
help
thee
to
a
pinion
,
or
breast
,
or
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
but
may
be
,
child
,
<EOS>
say
he
,
<EOS>
thou
likest
the
rump
;
shall
I
bring
it
thee
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
laugh
like
an
idiot
,
for
all
he
be
a
lord
's
son
,
and
may
be
a
lord
himself
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
be
the
son
of
Lord
#
#
#
#
;
 
and
his
mother
,
who
be
Lord
Davers
's
sister
,
be
dead
,
he
have
receive
what
education
he
have
,
from
Lord
Davers
's
direction
.
 
<EOS>
poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
for
all
his
greatness
!
<EOS>
he
will
ne'er
die
for
a
plot
 
at
least
of
his
own
hatching
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
then
have
go
up
,
I
would
have
give
you
his
picture
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
one
of
25
or
26
year
of
age
,
much
about
the
age
of
my
dear
master
,
he
be
a
most
odd
mortal
.
  
<EOS>
Pamela
,
say
my
lady
,
help
me
to
a
glass
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
Beck
,
say

,
you
shall
not

for
she
be
offer
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
my
lady
bride
confer
that
honour
upon
me
;
and
then
I
shall
see
if
she
can
stand
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
silent

and
never

.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
when
I
have
ask
thee
,
meek
-
one
,
half
a
dozen
question
together
,
I
suppose
thou
wilt
answer
them
all
at
once
!
 
<EOS>
pretty
creature
,
be
not
that
it
?
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
vexed
<EOS>
,
I
bite
a
piece
of
my
fan
out
,
not
know
what
I
do
;
but
still
I
say
nothing
,
and
do
nothing
but
flutter
it
,
and
fan
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
,
say
she
,
my
next
question
will
make
up
half
a
dozen
;
and
then
,
modest
one
,
I
shall
be
entitle
to
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
He
rise
and
bring
the
bottle
and
glass
;
<EOS>
come
,
say
he
,
Mrs.
Bride
,
be
pleased
to

and

<EOS>
Sir

a
good
hand
;

.
 
<EOS>
why
,
creature
,
say
she
,
dost
thou
think
thyself
above

?
 
<EOS>
and
then
fly
into
a
passion
:
 
Insolence
!
<EOS>
continue
she
,
<EOS>
this
moment
,
when
I
bid
you
,
know
your
duty
,
and
give
me
a
glass
of
wine
;
or
   
<EOS>
so
I
take
a
little
spirit
then
 
think
<EOS>
I
,
I
can
but
be
beat
.
 
<EOS>
if

say
I
,
to
attend
your

,
or
even

of
me
,
I
would
most
gladly
do
it
,
be
I
only
the
person

me
;
but
,
if
it
be
to
triumph
over
one
who
have
receive
honour
,
that
she
think
require
her
to
act
another
part
,
not
to
be
utterly
unworthy
of
them
<EOS>
,
I
must
say
,
I
can
not
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
seem
quite
surprised
,
and
look
now
upon
her
kinsman
,
and
then
upon
her
woman
 
<EOS>
I
be
astonish
 
quite
astonished
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
I
suppose
you
would
have
me
conclude
you
my
brother
's
wife
;
could
you
not
?
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
say
I
,
compel
me
to
say
this
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
return
she
,
but
dost
thou
<EOS>
thyself
think
thou
art
<EOS>
so
?
 
<EOS>
Silence
,
say
her
kinsman
,
give
consent
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
plain
enough
she
do
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
rise
,
madam
,
and
pay
my
duty
to
my
new
aunt
?
  
<EOS>
tell
me
,
say
my
lady
,
what
,
in
the
name
of
impudence
,
possess
thee
to
dare
to
look
upon
thyself
as
my
sister
?
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
reply
I
,
that
be
a
question
will
better
become
your
most
worthy
brother
to
answer
,
than
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
rise
in
great
wrath
:
but
her
woman
say
,
good
your
ladyship
,
you
will
do
yourself
more
harm
than
her
;
and
if
the
poor
girl
have
be
delude
so
,
as
you
have
hear
,
with
the
sham
marriage
,
she
will
be
more
deserving
of
your
ladyship
's
pity
than
anger
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
Beck
,
very
true
,
say
my
lady
;
but
there
be
no
bear
the
impudence
of
the
creature
in
the
mean
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
go
out
at
the
door
,
but
her
kinsman
run
and
set
his
back
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
bad
treatment
from
her
pride
,
and
violent
temper
;
but
this
be
bad
than
I
could
have
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
to
him
,
Sir
,
when
my
master
come
to
know
your
rude
behaviour
,
you
will
,
may
be
,
have
cause
to
repent
it
:
and
go
and
sit
down
in
the
window
again
.
  
<EOS>
another
challenge
,
by
gad
!
say
he
;
but
I
be
glad
she
say
her
master
!
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
madam
<EOS>
,
she
herself
do
not
believe
she
be
married
,
and
so
have
not
be
so
much
delude
as
you
think
for
:
<EOS>
and
,
come
to
me
with
a
most
barbarous
air
of
insult
,
he
say
,
kneel
on
one
knee
before
me
,
<EOS>
My
new
aunt
,
your
blessing
or
your
curse
<EOS>
,
I
care
not
which
;
but
quickly
give
me
one
or
other
,
that
I
may
not
lose
my
dinner
!
  
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
most
contemptuous
look
:
tinsel
toy
,
say
I
,
(
for
he
be
lace
all
over
)
,
<EOS>
twenty
or
thirty
year
hence
,
when
you
be
at
age
,
I
shall
know
how
to
answer
you
better
;
<EOS>
mean
time
,
sport
with
your
footman
,
and
not
with
me
!
<EOS>
and
so
I
remove
to
another
window
nearer
the
door
,
and
he
look
like
a
sad
fool
,
as
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
Beck
,
Beck
,
say
my
lady
,
this
be
not
to
be
bear
!
 
<EOS>
be
ever
the
like
hear
!
 
<EOS>
be
my
kinsman
and
Lord
Davers
's
to
be
thus
use
by
such
a
slut
?
<EOS>
and
be
come
to
me
:
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
begin
to
be
afraid
;
for
I
have
but
<EOS>
a
poor
heart
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
jewke
hear
high
word
,
come
in
again
,
with
the
second
course
,
and
say
,
pray
your
ladyship
,
do
not
so
discompose
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
this
day
's
business
will
make
matter
wider
than
ever
between
your
good
ladyship
and
your
brother
:
for
my
master
doat
upon
madam
.
  
<EOS>
woman
,
say
she
,
do
thou
be
silent
!
 
<EOS>
sure
,
I
that
be
bear
in
this
house
,
may
have
some
privilege
in
it
,
without
be
talk
to
by
the
saucy
servant
in
it
!
  
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
,
madam
,
reply
Mrs.
Jewkes
;
and
,
turn
to
me
,
say
,
Madam
,
my
master
will
take
it
very
ill
if
you
make
him
wait
for
you
thus
.
<EOS>
so
I
rise
to
go
out
;
but
my
lady
say
,
if
it
be
only
for
that
reason
she
shall
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
and
go
to
the
door
and
shut
it
,
and
say
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Woman
,
do
not
come
again
till
I
call
you
;
and
come
to
me
,
take
my
hand
,
and
say
,
find
your
leg
,
miss
,
if
you
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
up
,
and
she
tap
my
cheek
!
 
<EOS>
oh

say
she
,
that
scarlet
glow
shew
<EOS>
what
a
rancorous
little
heart
thou
hast
,
if

durst
shew
it
!
<EOS>
but
come
this
way
;
and
so
lead
me
to
her
chair
:
<EOS>
stand
there
,
say
she
,
and
answer
me
a
few
question
while
I
dine
,
and
I
will
dismiss
thee
,
till
I
call
thy
impudent
master
to
account
;
and
then
I
will
have
you
face
to
face
,
and
all
this
mystery
of
iniquity
shall
be
unravel
;
for
,
between

I
will
come
to
the
bottom
of

.
  
<EOS>
when

sit
down
,
I
move
to
the
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
parlour
,
look
into
the
private
garden
;
and

but

<EOS>

and
my
ladyship
's
woman
be
much
thy
better
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
the
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Dost
thou
think
thou
art
really
marry
?
  
<EOS>
I
see
,
madam
,
say
I
,
you
be
resolve
not
to
be
pleased
with
any
answer
I
shall
return
:
if
I
should
say
,
I
be
not
,
then
your
ladyship
will
call
me
hard
name
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
should
tell
a
fib
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
should
say
,
I
be
,
your
ladyship
will
ask
,
how
I
have
the
impudence
to
be
so
?
 
and
will
call
it
a
sham
-
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
say
she
,
be
answer
more
directly
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
what
,
madam
,
do
it
signify
what
I
think
?
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
believe
as
you
please
.
  
<EOS>
but
can'st
thou
have
the
vanity
,
the
pride
,
the
folly
,
say
she
,
to
think
thyself
actually
marry
to
my
brother
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
fool
,
child
;
and
libertine
enough
of
conscience
;
and
thou
art
not
the
first
in
the
list
of
his
credulous
harlot
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
say
I
,
(
and
be
in
a
sad
flutter
,
)
as
I
be
easy
,
and
please
with
my
lot
,
pray
,
madam
,
let
me
continue
so
,
as
long
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
time
enough
for
me
to
know
the
bad
,
when
the
bad
come
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
it
should
be
so
bad
,
your
ladyship
should
pity
me
,
rather
than
thus
torment
me
before
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
but
dost
not
think
I
be
concern
,
that
a
young
wench
,
whom
my
poor
dear
mother
love
so
well
,
should
thus
cast
herself
away
,
and
suffer
herself
to
be
delude
and
undo
,
after
such
a
noble
stand
as
thou
madst
for
so
long
a
time
?
  
<EOS>
I
think
myself
far
from
be
delude
and
undone
,
and
be
as
innocent
and
virtuous
as
ever
<EOS>
I
be
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
liest
,
child
,
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
so
your
ladyship
tell
me
twice
before
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
slap
on
the
hand
for
this
;
and
I
make
a
low
courtesy
,
and
say
,
I
humbly
thank
your
ladyship
!
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
refrain
tear
:
and
add
,
Your
dear
brother
,
madam
,
however
,
will
not
thank
your
ladyship
for
this
usage
of
me
,
though
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
come
a
little
near
me
,
my
dear
,
say
she
,
and
thou
shalt
have
a
little
more
than
that
to
tell
him
of
,
if
thou
think'st
thou
hast
not
make
mischief
enough
already
between
a
sister
and
brother
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
child
,
if
he
be
here
,
I
would
serve
thee
worse
,
and
him
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
be
,
say
I.
 
Dost
thou
threaten
me
,
mischief
-
maker
,
and
insolent
as
thou
art
?
  
<EOS>
now
,
pray
,
madam
,
say
I
,
(
but
get
to
a
little
distance
,
)
be
pleased
to
reflect
upon
all
that
you
have
say
to
me
,
since
I
have
have
the
honour
,
or
rather
misfortune
,
to
come
into
your
presence
;
whether
you
have
say
one
thing
befit
your
ladyship
's
degree
to
me
,
even
suppose
I
be
the
wench
and
the
creature
you
imagine
me
to
be
?
 
<EOS>
come
hither
,
my
pert
dear
,
reply
she
,
come
but
within
my
reach
for
one
moment
,
and
I
will
answer
thee
as
thou
deservest
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
sure
she
mean
to
box
my
ear
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
not
be
worthy
<EOS>
my
happy
lot
if
I
could
not
shew
some
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
cloth
be
take
away
,
I
say
,
I
suppose
I
may
now
depart
your
presence
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
not
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
will
lay
thee
a
wager
,
child
,
thy
stomach
be
too
full
to
eat
,
and
<EOS>
so
thou
may'st
<EOS>
fast
till
thy
<EOS>
mannerly
master
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
pray
your
ladyship
,
say
her
woman
,
let
the
poor
girl
sit
down
at
table
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
You
be
very
kind
,
Mrs.
Worden
;
but
<EOS>
time
,
as
you
say
,
be
much
alter
with
me
;
and
I
have
be
of
late
so
much
honour
with
well
company
,
that
I
can
not
stoop
to
yours
.
  
<EOS>
be
ever
such
confidence
!
<EOS>
say
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Beck
!
<EOS>
poor
Beck
!
<EOS>
say
her
kinsman
;
why
she
beat
you
quite
out
of
the
pit
!
 
<EOS>
Will
your
ladyship
,
say
I
,
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
how
long
I
be
to
tarry
?
 
<EOS>
for
you
will
please
to
see
by
that
letter
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
attend
my
master
's
command
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
give
her
the
dear
gentleman
's
letter
from
Mr.
Carlton
's
,
which
I
think
would
make
her
use
me
better
,
as
she
may
judge
by
it
of
the
honour
do
me
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
say
she
,
this
be
my
worthy
brother
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
direct
to
Mrs.
Andrews
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
you
,
I
suppose
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
run
on
,
make
remark
as
she
go
along
,
in
this
manner
:
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
PAMELA
,
 
"
<EOS>
mighty
well
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
hope
my
not
come
home
this
night
,
will
not
frighten
you
!
 
<EOS>
"
vastly
tender
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
and
do
it
frighten
you
,
child
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
I
can
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
a
person
in
thy
way
of
life
,
be
more
tenderly
use
than
an
honest
wife
.
 
<EOS>
but
mark
the
end
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wish
"
Pr'ythee
,
Jackey
,
mind
this
,
"
 
<EOS>
we
 
"
mind

to
the
good
neighbourhood
,
at
Sir
Simon
's

for

<EOS>
"
why
,
do
the
good
neighbourhood
,
and
do
Sir
Simon
,
permit
thy
visit
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
They
shall
have
none
of
mine
,
then
,
I
will
assure
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
desirous
to
set
out
on
Wednesday
for
the
other
house
"
<EOS>
so
,
Jackey
,
but
we
just
nick
it
<EOS>
,
I
find
:
"
 
that
,
as
well
as
in
return
for
the
civility
of
so
many
good
friend
,
who
will
be
there
on
purpose
,
I
would

therefore

"
My

<EOS>

<EOS>
very
true
,
aunt
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
a
plain
case
that
!
 
<EOS>
[
think
I
,
that
be
hard
upon
poor
matrimony
,
though
I
hope
my
lady
do
not
find
it
so

I
durst
not

<EOS>
W

]
<EOS>
"
I
must
repeat
that
 
pretty
miss

<EOS>
I
wish
thou
wast
as
admirable
for
thy
virtue

face
of
thine

"
  
<EOS>
and
I
hope
to
join
you
there
by
your
tea

time
in
the
afternoon
!
 
<EOS>
"
so
,
you
be
in
very
good
time
,
child
,
an
hour
or
two
hence
,
to
answer
all
your
important
pre
-
engagement
!
"
 
<EOS>
which
will
be
well
than
go
home
,
and
return
with
you
;
as
it
will
be
six
mile
difference
to
me
;
and
I
know
the
good
company
will
excuse
my
dress
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
true
;
any
dress
be
good
enough
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
for
such
company

for
a
companion

in
thy
ruin
state

<EOS>
Jackey
,
Jackey
,
mind
,
mind
,
again

<EOS>
more
fine
thing
still
!
<EOS>
"

little
absence
for
a
day
!
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
for
you
!
 
<EOS>
let
me
repeat
it
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
 
count
every
hour

little
absence
for
a
day

<EOS>
"
mind
,
too
,
the
wit
of
the
good
man
!
 
<EOS>
one
may
see
love
be
a
new
thing
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
very
tedious
time
go
since
he
see
his
deary
;
no
less
than
,
accord
to
his
amorous
calculation
,
a
dozen
day
and
night
,
at
least
!
<EOS>
and
yet
,
TEDIOUS
as
it
be
,
it
be
but
a
little
ABSENCE
.
 
<EOS>
well
say
,
my
good
,
accurate
,
and
consistent
brother
!
  
<EOS>
but
wise
man
in
love
be
always
the
great
simpleton
!
 
<EOS>
but
now
cone
the
reason
why
this
little
ABSENCE
,
which
,
at
the
same
time
,
be
so
great
an
ABSENCE
,
be
so
tedious
:
"
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
"
ay
,
now
for
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
with
the
UTMOST
sincerity
,
my
dear
love

out
upon
dearest
love
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
love
the
word
again
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
bid
your
uncle
never
call
me
dear
love
,
Jackey
!
"
 
<EOS>
for
ever
yours
!
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
brother
,
thou
liest
!
 
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
thou
dost
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
my
good
Lady
Andrews
,
or
what
shall
I
call
you
?
 
<EOS>
Your
dear
love
will
be
for
ever
yours
!
 
<EOS>
and
hast
thou
<EOS>
the
vanity
to
believe
this
?
 
<EOS>
but
stay
,
here
be
a
postscript
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
man
know
not
when
to
have
do
to
his
dear
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sadly
in
for't
,
truly
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
his
dear
love
,
you
be
mighty
happy
in
such
a
lover
!
"
 
<EOS>
if
you
could
go
to
dine
with
them
<EOS>
"
cry
you
mercy
,
my
dear
love
,
now
come
the
pre-
engagement
!
"
 
<EOS>
it
will
be
a
freedom
that
will
be
very
pleasing
to
them
,
and
the
more
,
as
they
do
not
expect
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
so
much
for
this
kind
letter
!
 
<EOS>
but
you
see
you
can
not
honour
this
admire
company
with
this
little
expect
,
and
,
<EOS>
but
in
complaisance
to
his
folly
,
I
dare
say
,
little
desire
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
forbear
admire
you
so
much
myself
,
my
dear
love
,
that
I
will
not
spare
you
at
all
,
this
whole
evening
:
<EOS>
for
'
tis
a
little
hard
,
if
thy
master
's
sister
may
not
be
bl
a
little
bit
with
thy
charming
company
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
find
I
have
shew
her
my
letter
to
very
little
purpose
,
and
repent
it
several
time
,
as
she
read
on
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
I
hope
your
ladyship
will
give
me
leave
to
send
my
excuse
to
your
good
brother
,
and
say
,
that
your
ladyship
be
come
,
and
be
so
fond
of
me
,
that
you
will
not
let
me
leave
you
.
 
<EOS>
pretty
creature
,
say
she
;
and
wantest
thou
thy
good
master
to
come
,
and
quarrel
with
his
sister
on
thy
account
?
 
<EOS>
but
thou
shalt
not
stir
from
my
presence
;
and
I
would
now
ask
thee
,
what
it
be
thou
mean
by
shew
me
this
letter
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
madam
,
say
I
,
to
shew
your
ladyship
how
I
be
engage
for
this
day
and
evening
.
 
<EOS>
and
for
nothing
else
?
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
can
not
tell
,
madam
,
say
I
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
can
collect
from
it
any
other
circumstance
,
I
may
hope
I
should
not
be
the
worse
treat
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
her
eye
begin
to
sparkle
with
passion
:
and
she
take
my
hand
,
and
say
,
grasp
it
very
hard
,
I
know
,
confident
creature
,
that
thou
shewedst
it
me
to
insult
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
shew
it
me
,
to
let
me
see
,
that
he
could
be
civiller
to
a
beggar
bear
,
than
to
me
,
or
to
my
good
Lord
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
You
shew
it
me
,
as
if
you
would
have
me
to
be
as
credulous
a
fool
as
yourself
,
to
believe
your
marriage
true
,
when
I
know
the
whole
trick
of
it
,
and
have
reason
to
believe
you
do
too
;
and
you
shew
it
me
,
to
upbraid
me
with
his
stooping
to
such
paint
dirt
,
to
the
disgrace
of
a
family
,
ancient
and
untainted
beyond
most
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
will
I
give
thee
one
hundred
guinea
for
one
bold
word
,
that
I
may
fell
thee
at
my
foot
!
  
<EOS>
be
not
this
very
dreadful
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
have
better
have
keep
the
letter
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
and
this
fearful
menace
,
and
her
fiery
eye
,
and
rageful
countenance
,
make
me
lose
all
my
courage
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
say
,
weeping
,
good
your
ladyship
,
pity
me
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
honest
<EOS>
;
indeed
I
be
virtuous
;
indeed
I
would
not
do
a
bad
thing
for
the
world
!
  
<EOS>
though
I
know
,
say
she
,
the
whole
trick
of
thy
pretended
marriage
,
and
thy
foolish
ring
here
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
wicked
nonsense
,
yet
I
should
not
have
patience
with
thee
,
if
thou
shouldst
but
offer
to
let
me
know
thy
vanity
prompt
thee
to
believe
thou
art
marry
to
my
brother
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
!
 
<EOS>
so
take
care
,
Pamela
<EOS>
;
take
care
,
beggarly
brat
;
take
care
.
  
<EOS>
good
madam
,
say
I
,
spare
my
dear
parent
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
honest
and
industrious
:
they
be
once
in
a
very
creditable
way
,
and
never
be
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
misfortune
may
attend
any
body
:
<EOS>
and
I
can
bear
the
cruell
imputation
on
myself
,
because
I
know
my
innocence
;
but
upon
such
honest
,
industrious
parent
,
who
go
through
the
great
trial
,
without
be
behold
to
any
thing
but
God
's
blessing
,
and
their
own
hard
labour
;
I
can
not
bear
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
art
thou
set
up
for
a
family
,
creature
as
thou
art
!
 
<EOS>
God
give
me
patience
with
thee
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
my
brother
's
folly
,
and
his
wickedness
,
together
,
will
,
in
a
little
while
,
occasion
a
search
at
the
heralds
'
office
,
to
set
out
thy
wretched
obscurity
!
 
<EOS>
provoke
me
,
I
desire
thou
wilt
!
 
<EOS>
one
hundred
guinea
<EOS>
will
I
give
thee
,
to
say
<EOS>
but
thou
thinkest
thou
art
<EOS>
marry
to
my
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
I
hope
,
will
not
kill
me
:
<EOS>
and
since
nothing
I
can
say
will
please
you
,
but
your
ladyship
be
resolve
to
quarrel
with
me
;
since
I
must
not
say
what
I
think
,
on
one
hand
nor
another
;
whatever
your
ladyship
design
by
me
,
be
pleased
to
do
,
and
let
me
depart
your
presence
!
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
slap
on
the
hand
,
and
reach
to
box
my
ear
;
but
Mrs.
jewke
hearken
without
,
and
her
woman
too
,
they
both
come
in
at
that
instant
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
push
herself
in
between
us
;
Your
ladyship
know
not
what
you
do
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
you
do
not
!
 
<EOS>
My
master
would
never
forgive
me
,
if
I
suffer
,
in
his
house
,
one
he
so
dearly
love
,
to
be
so
used
;
and
it
must
not
be
,
though
you
be
Lady
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
Her
woman
too
interpose
,
and
tell
her
,
I
be
not
worth
her
ladyship
's
anger
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
like
a
person
beside
herself
.
  
<EOS>
I
offer
to
go
out
,
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
take
my
hand
to
lead
me
out
:
but
her
kinsman
set
his
back
against
the
door
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
,
and
say
,
I
should
not
go
,
till
his
aunt
permit
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
draw
it
half
-
way
,
and
I
be
so
terrified
,
that
I
cry
out
,
<EOS>
oh
,
the
sword
!
<EOS>
the
sword
!
<EOS>
and
,
not
know
what
I
do
,
I
run
to
my
lady
herself
,
and
clasp
my
arm
about
her
,
forget
,
<EOS>
just
then
,
how
much
she
be
my
enemy
,
and
say
,
sink
on
my
knee
,
defend
me
,
good
your
ladyship
!
<EOS>
the
sword
!
<EOS>
the
sword
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
lady
will
fall
into
fit
!
 
<EOS>
but
Lady
Davers
be
herself
so
startled
at
the
matter
be
carry
so
far
,
that
she
do
not
mind
her
word
,
and
say
,
Jackey
,
do
not
draw
your
sword
!
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
as
great
as
her
spirit
be
,
she
can
not
bear
that
.
  
<EOS>
come
,
say
she
,
be
comfort
;
he
shall
not
frighten
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
overcome
my
anger
,
and
will
pity
you
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
wench
,
rise
up
,
and
do
not
be
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
hold
her
salt
to
my
nose
,
and
I
do
not
faint
.
<EOS>
and
my
lady
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
if
you
would
be
forgive
,
leave
Pamela
and
me
by
ourselves
;
and
,
Jackey
,
do
you
withdraw
;
only
you
,
Beck
,
stay
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
sit
down
in
the
window
,
all
in
a
sad
fluster
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
I
be
sadly
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
say
her
woman
,
You
should
not
sit
in
my
lady
's
presence
,
Mrs.
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
let
her
sit
till
she
be
a
little
recover
of
her
fright
,
say
my
lady
,
and
do
you
set
my
chair
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
sit
over
-
against
me
,
and
say
,
to
be
sure
,
Pamela
,
you
have
be
very
provoking
with
your
tongue
,
to
be
sure
you
have
,
as
well
upon
my
nephew
,
(
who
be
a
man
of
quality
too
,
)
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
palliate
her
cruel
usage
,
and
beginning
,
I
suppose
,
to
think
herself
she
have
carry
it
further
than
she
could
answer
it
to
her
brother
,
she
want
to
lay
the
fault
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Own
,
say
she
,
you
have
be
very
saucy
;
and
beg
my
pardon
,
and
beg
Jackey
's
pardon
,
and
I
will
try
to
pity
you
.
 
<EOS>
for
you
be
a
sweet
girl
,
after
all
;
if
you
have
but
hold
out
,
and
be
honest
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
injurious
to
me
,
madam
,
say
I
,
to
imagine
I
be
not
honest
!
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
have
you
not
be
a
-
bed
with
my
brother
?
<EOS>
tell
me
that
.
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
reply
I
,
ask
your
question
in
a
strange
way
,
and
in
strange
word
.
  
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
your
delicacy
be
wound
,
I
suppose
,
by
my
plain
question
!
 
<EOS>
this
niceness
will
soon
leave
you
,
wench
:
<EOS>
It
will
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
but
answer
me
directly
.
 
<EOS>
then
your
ladyship
's
next
question
,
say
I
,
will
be
,
<EOS>
be
I
married
?
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
not
bear
my
answer
to
that
 
and
will
beat
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
han't
beat
you
yet
;
have
I
,
Beck
?
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
want
to
make
out
a
story
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
bear
thou
shouldst
so
much
as
think
thou
art
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
whole
trick
of
it
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
'
tis
my
opinion
,
dost
thou
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
thy
little
cunning
,
that
it
may
look
like
a
cloak
to
thy
yielding
,
and
get
well
term
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
pr'ythee
,
wench
,
thou
seest
<EOS>
I
know
the
world
a
little
;
 
almost
as
much
at
thirty
-
two
,
as
thou
dost
at
sixteen
.
 
<EOS>
remember
that
!
  
<EOS>
I
rise
from
the
window
,
and
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
beat
me
again
,
if
you
please
,
say
I
,
but
I
must
tell
your
ladyship
<EOS>
,
I
scorn
your
word
,
and
be
as
much
married
as
your
ladyship
!
  
<EOS>
at
that
she
run
to
me
;
but
her
woman
interpose
again
:
let
the
vain
wicked
creature
go
from
your
presence
,
madam
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
worthy
to
be
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
<EOS>
but
vex
your
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
stand
away
,
Beck
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
an
assertion
that
I
would
not
take
from
my
brother
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
much
married
as
I
!
 
<EOS>
be
that
to
be
bear
?
 
<EOS>
but
if
the
creature
believe
she
be
,
madam
,
say
her
woman
,
she
be
to
be
as
much
pity
for
her
credulity
,
as
despise
for
her
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
hope
to
have
slipt
out
at
the
door
;
but
she
catch
hold
of
my
gown
,
and
pull
me
back
.
 
<EOS>
pray
your
ladyship
,
say
I
,
do
not
kill
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
lock
the
door
,
and
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
see
Mrs.
Jewkes
before
the
window
,
I
lift
up
the
sash
,
and
say
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
believe
it
would
be
good
for
the
chariot
to
go
to
your
master
,
and
let
him
know
,
that
Lady
Davers
be
here
;
and
I
can
not
leave
her
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
resolve
to
be
displeased
,
let
me
say
what
I
would
.
  
<EOS>
say
she
,
no
,
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
he
will
then
think
,
that
I
make
the
creature
my
companion
,
and
know
not
how
to
part
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
your
ladyship
,
reply
I
,
could
not
have
take
exception
at
this
message
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
nothing
,
wench
,
say
she
,
of
what
belong
to
people
of
condition
<EOS>
:
how
shouldst
thou
?
 
<EOS>
nor
,
think
<EOS>
I
,
do
I
desire
it
,
at
this
rate
.
  
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
,
madam
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
nothing
at
all
,
reply
she
;
let
him
expect
his
dear
love
,
and
be
disappoint
;
it
be
<EOS>
but
add
a
few
more
hour
,
and
he
will
make
every
one
a
day
,
in
his
amorous
account
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
come
nearer
me
,
and
my
lady
walk
about
the
room
,
be
then
at
the
end
<EOS>
,
I
whisper
,
let
Robert
stay
at
the
elm
;
I
will
have
a
struggle
for't
by
and
by
.
  
<EOS>
as
much
married
as
I
!
<EOS>
repeat
she
.
 
<EOS>
the
insolence
of
the
creature
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
walk
about
the
room
,
talk
to
herself
,
to
her
woman
,
and
now
and
then
to
me
;
but
see
I
could
not
please
her
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
have
better
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
,
<EOS>
be
I
not
worthy
an
answer
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
speak
,
say
I
,
your
ladyship
be
angry
at
me
,
though
ever
so
respectfully
;
if
I
do
not
,
I
can
not
please
:
Would
your
ladyship
tell
me
<EOS>
but
how
I
shall
oblige
you
,
and
I
would
do
it
with
all
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
confess
the
truth
,
say
she
,
that
thou
art
an
undone
creature
;
<EOS>
hast
be
in
bed
with
thy
master
;
and
art
sorry
for
it
,
and
for
the
mischief
thou
hast
occasion
between
him
and
me
;
and
then
I
will
pity
thee
,
and
persuade
him
to
pack
thee
off
,
with
a
hundred
or
two
of
guinea
;
and
some
honest
farmer
may
take
pity
of
thee
,
and
patch
up
thy
shame
,
for
the
sake
of
the
money
;
and
if
nobody
will
have
thee
,
thou
must
vow
penitence
,
and
be
as
humble
as
I
once
think
thee
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sick
at
heart
,
at
all
this
passionate
extravagance
,
and
to
be
hinder
from
be
<EOS>
where
be
the
desire
of
my
soul
,
and
afraid
too
of
incur
my
dear
master
's
displeasure
;
and
,
as
I
sit
,
I
see
it
be
no
hard
matter
to
get
out
of
the
window
into
the
front
yard
<EOS>
,
the
parlour
be
even
with
the
yard
,
and
so
have
a
fair
run
for
it
;
and
after
I
have
see
my
lady
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
again
,
in
her
walk
,
have
not
pull
down
the
sash
,
when
I
speak
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
I
get
upon
the
seat
,
and
whip
out
in
a
minute
,
and
run
away
as
hard
as
I
could
drive
,
my
lady
call
after
me
to
return
,
and
her
woman
at
the
other
window
:
but
two
of
her
servant
appear
at
her
cry
out
,
and
she
bid
them
to
stop
me
,
I
say
,
touch
me
at
your
peril
,
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
but
their
lady
's
command
would
have
prevail
on
them
,
have
not
Mr.
Colbrand
,
who
,
it
seem
,
have
be
kindly
order
,
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
to
be
within
call
,
when
she
see
how
I
be
treat
,
come
up
,
and
put
on
one
of
his
deadly
fierce
look
,
the
only
time
,
I
think
,
it
ever
become
him
,
and
say
,
He
would
chine
the
man
,
that
be
his
word
,
who
offer
to
touch
his
lady
;
and
so
he
run
alongside
of
me
;
and
I
hear
my
lady
say
,
the
creature
fly
like
a
bird
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Colbrand
,
with
his
huge
stride
,
could
hardly
keep
pace
with
me
;
and
I
never
stop
,
till
I
get
to
the
chariot
;
and
Robert
have
get
down
,
see
me
run
at
a
distance
,
and
hold
the
door
in
his
hand
,
with
the
step
ready
down
;
and
in
I
jump
,
without
touch
the
step
,
say
,
drive
me
,
drive
me
,
as
fast
as
you
can
,
out
of
my
lady
's
reach
!
 
<EOS>
and
he
mount
;
and
<EOS>
Colbrand
say
,
do
not
be
frightened
,
madam
<EOS>
;
nobody
shall
hurt
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
shut
the
door
,
and
away
Robert
drive
;
but
I
be
quite
out
of
breath
,
and
do
not
recover
it
,
and
my
fright
,
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Colbrand
be
so
kind
,
but
I
do
not
know
it
till
the
chariot
stop
at
Sir
Simon
's
,
to
step
up
behind
the
carriage
,
l
,

!
 
<EOS>
do
you
tell

,
say

?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
I
do
at
last
;
but
she
will
have
it
'
tis
a
sham
-
marriage
,
and
that
I
be
a
vile
creature
:
and
she
be
ready
to
beat
me
,
when
I
say
so
:
for
she
could
not
have
patience
,
that
I
should
be
deem
her
sister
,
as
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
how
unlucky
it
be
,
reply
he
,
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
home
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
send
to
me
here
?
 
<EOS>
Send
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
be
keep
prisoner
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
let
me
stir
,
or
do
you
think
I
would
have
be
hinder
from
obey
you
?
<EOS>
nay
,
I
tell
them
,
that
I
have
a
pre
-
engagement
;
but
she
ridicule
me
,
and
say
,
waiting
-
maid
talk
of
pre
-
engagement
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
shew
her
your
kind
letter
;
and
she
make
a
thousand
remark
upon
it
,
and
make
me
wish
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
whatever
I
could
do
or
say
,
there
be
no
please
her
;
and
I
be
a
creature
and
wench
,
and
all
that
be
naught
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
be
angry
with
her
on
my
account
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
say
he
,
I
suppose
she
hardly
ask
you
to
dine
with
her
;
for
she
come
before
dinner
,
I
presume
,
if
it
be
soon
after
you
have
receive
my
letter
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
dine
with
my
lady
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
she
would
make
me
wait
at
table
upon
her
,
with
her
woman
,
because
she
would
not
expose
herself
and
me
before
the
man
-
servant
;
which
you
know
,
sir
,
be
very
good
of
her
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
but
do
you
wait
upon
her
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
have
have
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
only
,
Pamela
,
reply
he
,
if
you
do
,
and
know
not
what
belong
to
your
character
,
as
my
wife
,
I
shall
be
very
angry
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
do
not
,
but
refuse
it
,
out
of
consideration
to
the
dignity
you
have
raise
me
to
;
else
,
sir
,
I
could
have
wait
on
my
knee
upon
your
sister
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
say
he
,
you
confirm
my
opinion
of
your
prudence
and
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
an
insolent
woman
,
and
shall
dearly
repent
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
she
be
to
be
excuse
,
because
she
will
not
believe
I
be
indeed
married
;
so
do
not
be
too
angry
at
her
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
Ladies
,
pray
do
not
let
us
keep
you
from
the
company
;
I
will
only
ask
a
question
or
two
more
,
and
attend
you
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Lady
Jones
,
<EOS>
I
so
much
long
to
hear
this
story
of
poor
madam
's
persecution
,
that
,
if
it
be
not
improper
,
I
should
be
glad
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
would
stay
for
the
same
reason
;
my
master
say
,
He
have
no
secret
to
ask
;
and
that
it
be
kind
of
them
to
interest
themselves
in
my
grievance
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Darnford
go
into
the
company
,
and
tell
them
the
cause
of
my
detention
;
for
,
it
seem
,
my
dear
master
love
me
too
well
,
to
keep
to
himself
the
disappointment
my
not
be
here
to
receive
him
,
be
to
him
;
and
they
have
all
give
the
two
Misses
Boroughs
and
Mr.
Perry
,
the
Stamford
guest
,
such
a
character
of
me
,
that
they
say
they
be
impatient
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
say
my
master
,
but
,
Pamela
,
you
say
they
and
them
:
<EOS>
who
have
my
sister
with
her
besides
her
woman
?
 
<EOS>
Her
nephew
,
sir
,
and
three
footman
on
horseback
;
and
she
and
her
woman
be
in
her
chariot
and
six
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
a
sad
coxcomb
,
say
he
:
how
do
he
behave
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
not
extraordinarily
,
sir
;
but
I
should
not
complain
;
for
I
be
even
with
him
;
because
I
think
I
ought
not
to
bear
with
him
as
with
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
if
I
know
he
behave
unhandsomely
to
my
jewel
,
I
would
send
him
home
to
his
uncle
without
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
return
I
,
I
be
as
hard
upon
him
as
he
be
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
'
Tis
kind
to
say
so
;
but
I
believe
I
shall
make
them
dearly
repent
their
visit
,
if
I
find
their
behaviour
to
call
for
my
resentment
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
sure
,
my
dear
,
you
may
have
get
away
when
you
go
to
your
own
dinner
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
her
ladyship
lock
me
in
,
and
would
not
let
me
stir
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
ha'nt
eat
any
dinner
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
nor
have
a
stomach
for
any
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
dear
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
how
get
you
away
at
last
?
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
reply
I
,
I
jump
out
of
the
parlour
window
,
and
run
away
to
the
chariot
,
which
have
wait
for
me
several
hour
,
by
the
elm
-
walk
,
from
the
time
of
my
lady
be
come
(
for
I
be
just
go
,
as
I
say
)
;
and
Mr.
Colbrand
conduct
me
through
her
servant
,
whom
she
call
to
,
to
stop
me
;
and
be
so
kind
to
step
behind
the
chariot
,
unknown
to
me
,
and
see
me
safe
here
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
say
he
,
these
insolent
creature
must
have
treat
you
vilely
.
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
what
part
do
Mrs.
Jewkes
act
in
this
affair
?
 
<EOS>
a
very
kind
part
,
sir
,
say
I
,
in
my
behalf
;
and
I
shall
thank
her
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
sweet
creature
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
thou
lovest
to
speak
well
of
every
body
;
but
I
hope
she
deserve
it
;
for
she
know
you
be
marry
.
 
<EOS>
but
come
,
we
will
now
join
the
company
,
and
try
to
forget
all
you
have
suffer
,
for
two
or
three
hour
,
that
we
may
not
tire
the
company
with
our
concern
and
resume
the
subject
as
we
go
home
:
and
you
shall
find
I
will
do
you
justice
,
as
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
forgive
me
,
sir
,
say
I
,
and
be
not
angry
?
 
<EOS>
forgive
you
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
return
he
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
make
you
satisfaction
for
what
you
have
suffer
from
me
,
and
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
with
those
word
he
lead
me
into
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
He
very
kindly
present
me
to
the
two
strange
lady
,
and
the
gentleman
,
and
them
to
me
:
and
Sir
Simon
,
who
be
at
card
,
rise
from
table
,
and
salute
me
:
<EOS>
Adad
!
<EOS>

,
I
be
glad
to
see

here
.
<EOS>

,
it
seem

have
be
a
prisoner
!
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
<EOS>
well
you
be
,
or
your
spouse
and
<EOS>
I
should
have
sit
in
judgment
upon
you
,
and
condemn
you
to
a
fearful
punishment
for
your
first
crime
of
laesae
majestatis
:
(
I
have
this
explain
to
me
afterwards
,
as
a
sort
of
treason
against
my
liege
lord
and
husband
:
)
<EOS>
for
we
husband
hereabouts
,
say
he
,
be
resolve
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
with
our
wife
,
and
your
lord
and
master
shall
shew
us
the
way
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
see
by
your
eye
,
<EOS>
my
sweet
culprit
,
add
he
,
and
your
complexion
<EOS>
,
you
have
have
sour
sauce
to
your
sweet
meat
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
say
,
I
think
we
be
oblige
to
our
sweet
guest
,
at
last
;
for
she
be
force
to
jump
out
at
a
window
to
come
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
say
Mrs.
Peters
;
 
and
my
master
's
back
be
turn
,
say
she
,
Lady
Davers
,
when
a
maiden
,
be
always
vastly
passionate
;
but
a
very
good
lady
when
her
passion
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
make
nothing
of
slap
her
maid
about
,
and
beg
their
pardon
afterwards
,
if
they
take
it
patiently
;
otherwise
she
use
to
say
the
creature
be
even
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
say
I
,
I
have
be
a
many
creature
and
wench
,
and
I
know
not
what
;
for
these
be
the
name
she
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
I
ought
to
act
up
to
the
part
her
dear
brother
have
give
me
;
and
so
I
have
but

.
  
<EOS>
o
,
madam

<EOS>
but
your
kind

ought

worthy

or
third
place
after

Twas

for

of
this

<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
my
Pamela

person
,
all
lovely
as
you

be
far
short
of
her
mind
:
<EOS>
that
,
indeed
,
first
attract
my
admiration
,
and
make
me
her
lover
:
but
they
be
the
beauty
of
her
mind
,
that
make
me
her
husband
;
and
proud
,
my
sweet
dear
,
say
he
,
press
my
hand

be
I
of
that
title
.
  
<EOS>
well

say
Mr.

,
very
kindly
and
politely
,
excellent
as
your
lady
be
,
I
know
not
the
gentleman
that
could
deserve
her
,
but
that
one
who
could
say
such
just
and
such
fine
thing
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
all
abash
;
and
take
Miss
Darnford
's
hand
,
and
say
,
save
me
,
dear
miss
,
by
your
sweet
example
,
from
my
rise
pride
.
 
<EOS>
but
could
I
deserve
half
these
kind
thing
<EOS>
,
what
a
happy
creature
should
I
be
!
<EOS>
say
Miss
Darnford
,
You
deserve
them
all
,
indeed
you
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
the
company
have
sit
down
to
loo
,
my
master
be
press
,
say
he
would
take
one
game
at
whist
;
but
have
rather
be
excuse
too
,
have
be
up
all
night
:
and
I
ask
how
his
friend
do
?
 
<EOS>
We
will
talk
of
that
,
say
he
,
another
time
;
which
,
and
his
seriousness
,
make
me
fear
the
poor
gentleman
be
dead
,
as
it
prove
.
  
<EOS>
We
cast
in
,
and
Miss
Boroughs
and
my
master
be
together
,
and
Mr.
Perry
and
I
;
and
I
have
all
four
honour
the
first
time
,
and
we
be
up
at
one
deal
.
 
<EOS>
say
my
master
,
an
honourable
hand
,
Pamela
,
should
go
with
an
honourable
heart
;
but
you
would
not
have
be
up
,
if
a
knave
have
not
be
one
.
 
<EOS>
Whist
,
sir
,
say
Mr.
Perry
,
you
know
,
be
a
court
game
originally
;
and
the
knave
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
signify
always
the
prime
minister
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
well
,
say
my
master
,
if
now
there
be
but
one
knave
in
a
court
,
out
of
four
person
,
take
the
court
through
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
and
queen
,
sir
,
say
Mr.
Perry
,
can
do
no
wrong
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
be
two
that
must
be
good
out
of
four
;
and
the
ace
seem
too
plain
a
card
to
mean
much
hurt
.
  
<EOS>
We
compliment
the
king
,
say
my
master
,
in
that
manner
;
and
'
tis
well
to
do
so
,
because
there
be
something
sacred
in
the
character
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
if
force
of
example
be
consider
,
it
be
go
a
great
way
;
for
certainly
a
good
master
make
a
good
servant
,
generally
speak
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
,
add
he
,
I
will
say
,
in
regard
to
the
ace
:
I
have
always
look
upon
that
plain
and
honest
looking
card
in
the
light
you
do
:
and
have
consider
whist
as
an
english
game
in
its
original
;
which
have
make
me
fonder
of
it
than
of
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
for
by
the
ace
I
have
always
think
the
law
of
the
land
denote
;
and
as
the
ace
be
above
the
king
or
queen
,
and
win
them
,
I
think
the
law
should
be
think
so
too
;
though
,
may
be
,
I
shall
be
deem
a
Whig
for
my
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
never
play
whist
,
say
Mr.
Perry
,
without
thinking
of
this
,
and
shall
love
the
game
the
well
for
the
thought
;
though
I
be
no
party
-
man
.
<EOS>
nor
I
,
say
my
master
;
for
I
think
the
distinction
of
whig
and
tory
odious
;
and
love
the
one
or
the
other
only
as
they
be
honest
and
worthy
man
;
and
have
never
(
nor
never
shall
,
hope
)
<EOS>
give
a
vote
,
but
accord
to
what
I
think
be
for
the
public
good
,
let
either
whig
or
tory
propose
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
,
sir
,
reply
Mr.
Perry
,
all
gentleman
in
your
station
would
act
so
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
no
undue
influence
,
say
my
master
,
I
be
willing
to
think
so
well
of
all
mankind
,
that
I
believe
they
generally
would
.
  
<EOS>
but
you
see
,
say
he
,
by
my
Pamela
's
hand
,
when
all
the
court
-
card
get
together
,
and
be
act
by
one
mind
,
the
game
be
usually
turn
accordingly
:
though
now
and
then
,
too
,
it
may
be
so
circumstance
,
that
honour
will
do
them
no
good
,
and
they
be
force
to
depend
altogether
upon
trick
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
this
way
of
talk
pretty
than
the
game
itself
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
though
I
have
win
the
game
,
I
hope
I
be
no
trickster
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
my
master
,
God
forbid
but
court
-
card
should
sometimes
win
with
honour
!
 
<EOS>
but
you
see
,
for
all
that
<EOS>
,
your
game
be
as
much
owe
to
the
knave
as
the
king
;
and
you
,
my
fair
-
one
,
lose
no
advantage
,
when
it
be
put
into
your
power
.
  
<EOS>
else
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
should
not
have
do
justice
to
my
partner
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
certainly
right
,
Pamela
,
reply
he
;
though
you
thereby
beat
your
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
may
be
my
partner
next
,
and
I
must
do
justice
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
always
choose
so
worthy
a
friend
,
as
chance
have
give
you
for
a
partner
,
and
I
shall
never
find
fault
with
you
,
do
what
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Perry
say
,
You
be
very
good
to
me
,
sir
;
and
Miss
Boroughs
,
I
observe
,
seem
pleased
with
the
compliment
to
her
humble
servant
;
by
which
I
see
she
esteem
him
,
as
he
appear
to
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
say
I

<EOS>

my
account
,
because
I
have
have
no
dinner
;
and
there
pass
very
agreeable
compliment
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
would
help
me
first
,
because
I
have
so
long
fast
,
as
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
would
have
place
himself
next
me
:
<EOS>
and
my
master
say
,
He
think
it
be
good
,
where
there
be
an
equal
number
of
lady
and
gentleman
,
that
they
should
sit
,
intermingle
,
that
the
gentleman
may
be
employ
in
help
and
serve
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
say
,
She
hope
Sir
Simon
would
not
sit
above
any
lady
at
his
own
table
especially
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
I
shall
sit
over
-
against
her
,
however
,
and
that
be
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
sir
could
not
keep
his
eye
off
me
,
and
seem
generously
delighted
with
all
I
do
,
and
all
I
say
;
and
every
one
be
pleased
to
see
his
kind
and
affectionate
behaviour
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
bring
up
the
discourse
about
Lady
Davers
again
;
and
my
master
say
,
I
fear
,
Pamela
,
you
have
be
hardly
use
,
more
than
you
will
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
my
sister
's
passionate
temper
too
well
,
to
believe
she
could
be
over
-
civil
to
you
,
especially
as
it
happen
so
unluckily
that
I
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
add
he
,
she
have
no
pique
to
you
,
my
dear
,
yet
what
have
pass
between
her
and
me
,
have
so
exasperate
her
,
that
I
know
she
would
have
quarrel
with
my
horse
,
if
she
have
think
I
value
it
,
and
nobody
else
be
in
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
do
not
say
so
of
good
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
I
know
she
come
on
purpose
to
quarrel
;
and
have
she
not
find
herself
under
a
very
violent
uneasiness
,
after
what
have
pass
between
us
,
and
my
treatment
of
her
lord
's
letter
,
she
would
not
have
offer
to
come
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
what
sort
of
language
have
she
for
me
,
Pamela
?
<EOS>
o
sir
,
very
good
,
only
her
well
-
mannered
brother
,
and
such
as
that
!
  
<EOS>
only
,
say
he
,
'
tis
take
up
the
attention
of
the
company
disagreeably
,
or
I
could
tell
you
almost
every
word
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jones
wish
to
hear
a
further
account
of
my
lady
's
conduct
,
and
most
of
the
company
join
with
her
,
particularly
Mrs.
Peters
;
who
say
,
that
as
they
know
the
story
,
and
Lady
Davers
's
temper
,
though
she
be
very
good
in
the
main
,
they
could
wish
to
be
so
agreeably
entertain
,
if
he
and
I
please
;
because
they
imagine
I
should
have
no
difficulty
after
this
.
  
<EOS>
tell
me
,
then
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
do
she
lift
up
her
hand
at
you
?
 
<EOS>
do
she
strike
you
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
not
!
 
<EOS>
a
little
slap
of
the
hand
,
say
I
,
or
so
.
  
<EOS>
insolent
woman
!
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
I
hope
,
offer
to
strike
your
face
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
be
a
little
saucy
once
or
twice
;
and
she
would
have
give
me
a
cuff
on
the
ear
,
if
her
woman
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
not
interpose
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
come
out
at
the
door
?
 
<EOS>
because
,
say
I
,
her
ladyship
sit
in
the
chair
against
it
,
one
while
,
and
another
while
lock
it
;
else
I
offer
several
time
to
get
away
.
  
<EOS>
She
know
I
expect
you
here
<EOS>
:
You
say
,
you
shew
her
my
letter
to
you
?
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
I
;
but
I
have
well
not
;
for
she
as
then
more
exasperated
,
and
make
strange
comment
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
not
,
say
he
;
but
,
do
she
not
see
,
by
the
kind
epithet
in
it
,
that
there
be
no
room
to
doubt
of
our
be
marry
?
 
<EOS>
o
,
sir
,
reply
I
,
and
make
the
company
smile
,
she
say
,
for
that
very
reason
she
be
sure
I
be
not
married
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
like
my
sister
!
<EOS>
say
he
;
exactly
like
her
;
and
yet
she
live
very
happily
herself
:
for
her
poor
lord
never
contradict
her
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
dare
not
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
a
great
many
wench
,
be
you
not
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
for
that
be

word
with

.
 
<EOS>
yes

wench
and

and

<EOS>

<EOS>

me
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
must
not
have
you
angry
with
Lady
Davers
;
while
you
be
so
good
to
me
,
'
tis
all
nothing
;
only
the
trouble
I
have
that
I
can
not
be
suffer
to
shew
how
much
I
honour
her
ladyship
,
as
your
sister
.
  
<EOS>

I
must
love
her
after
all
;
though
I
shall
not
be
pleased
with
her
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
her
love
for
me
,
<EOS>
though
thus
oddly
express
,
that
make
her
so
uneasy
:
and
,
after
all
,
she
come
,
I
be
sure
,
to
be
reconcile
to
me
;
though
it
must
be
through
a
good
hearty
quarrel
first
:
for
she
can
shew
a
good
deal
of
sunshine
;
but
it
must
be
always
after
a
storm
;
and
I
will
love
her
dearly
,
if
she
have
not
be
,
and
will
not
be
,
too
hard
upon
my
dear
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
say
,
Sir
,
you
be
very
good
,
and
very
kind
;
I
love
to
see
this
complaisance
to
your
sister
,
though
she
be
in
fault
,
so
long
as
you
can
shew
it
with
so
much
justice
to
the
sweetest
innocence
and
merit
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
by
all
that
be
good
,
Mr.
Peters
,
say
he
,
I
would
present
my
sister
with
a
thousand
pound
,
if
she
would
kindly
take
my
dear
Pamela
by
the
hand
,
and
wish
her
joy
,
and
call
her
sister
!
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
should
be
unworthy
of
the
dear
creature
that
smile
upon
me
there
,
if
it
be
not
principally
for
her
sake
,
and
the
pleasure
it
would
give
her
,
that
I
say
this
:
for
I
will
never
be
thoroughly
reconcile
to
my
sister
till
she
do
;
for
I
most
sincerely
think
,
as
to
myself
,
that
my
dear
wife
,
there
she
sit
,
do
me
more
honour
in
her
new
relation
,
than
she
receive
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
be
overwhelmed
with
your
goodness
!
 
<EOS>
and
my
eye
be
fill
with
tear
of
joy
and
gratitude
:
and
all
the
company
with
one
voice
bless
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
Lady
Jones
be
pleased
to
say
,
the
behaviour
of
you
two
happy
one
,
to
each
other

be
the
most
edifying
I
ever
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
always
improve
when
I
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
how
happy
would
every
good
lady
be
with
such
a
gentleman
,
and
every
good
gentleman
with
such
a
lady
!
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
you
seem
make
for
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
o
madam
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
you
be
so
kind
,
so
good
to
me
,
that
I
know
not
how
to
thank
you
enough
!
 
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
You
deserve
more
than
I
can
express
;
for
,
to
all
that
know
your
story
,
you
be
a
matchless
person
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
an
ornament
to
our
sex
and
your
virtue
,
though
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
be
so
generous
as
he
be
,
have
meet
with
no
more
than
its
due
reward
.
 
<EOS>
God
long
bless
you
together
!
  
<EOS>
You
be
,
say
my
dear
sir
,
very
good
to
me
,
madam
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
take
liberty
in
my
former
life
,
that
deserve
not
so
much
excellence
.
<EOS>
I
have
offend
extremely
,
by
trial
glorious
to
my
Pamela
,
but
disgraceful
to
me
,
against
a
virtue
that
I
now
consider
as
almost
sacred
;
and
I
shall
not
think
I
deserve
her
,
till
I
can
bring
my
manner
,
my
sentiment
,
and
my
action
,
to
a
conformity
with
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
Pamela
,
continue
he
,
I
want
you
to
be
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
you
be
,
and
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
well
;
and
if
you
could
,
it
would
be
but
fill
me
with
despair
to
attain
the
awful
height
of
virtue
at
which
you
have
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
add
the
dear
gentleman
,
the
scene
I
have
beheld
within
these
twelve
hour
,
have
make
me
more
serious
than
otherwise
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
assure
you
,
before
all
this
good
company
<EOS>
,
I
speak
the
sentiment
of
my
heart
,
and
those
not
of
this
day
only
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
happy
daughter
be
yours
,
o
my
dear
father
and
mother
!
 
<EOS>
I
owe
it
all
to
God
's
grace
,
and
to
yours
and
my
good
lady
's
instruction
<EOS>
:
and
to
these
let
me
always
look
back
with
grateful
acknowledgment
,
that
I
may
not
impute
to
myself
,
and
be
proud
,
my
inexpressible
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
be
so
kindly
pleased
with
our
concern
,
and
my
dear
master
's
goodness
,
that
he
,
observe
their
indulgence
,
and
be
himself
curious
to
know
the
further
particular
of
what
have
pass
between
my
lady
and
me
,
repeat
his
question
,
what
she
have
call
me
besides
wench
and
creature
?
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
My
lady
,
suppose
I
be
wicked
,
lament
over
me
,
very
kindly
,
my
depravity
and
fall
,
and
say
,
what
a
thousand
pity
it
be
,
so
much
virtue
,
as
she
be
pleased
to
say
,
be
so
destroy
;
and
that
I
have
yield
,
after
so
noble
a
stand
!
<EOS>
as
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
gentleman
and
lady
,
say
I
!
<EOS>
you
know
my
story
,
it
seem
;
and
I
be
command
,
by
one
who
have
a
title
to
all
my
obedience
,
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
They
give
all
of
them
bow
of
approbation
,
that
they
may
not
interrupt
me
;
and
I
continue
my
story
 
the
man
-
servant
withdraw
,
at
a
motion
of
Mr.
B
#
#
#
#
,
on
my
look
towards
them
:
and
then
,
at
Lady
Darnford
's
come
in
,
I
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
ladyship
,
that
I
be
still
innocent
,
and
would
be
so
,
and
it
be
injurious
to
suppose
me
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
tell
me
,
wench
,
say
she
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
must
not
tell
you
what
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
do
,
say
my
master
,
to
clear
my
sister
;
we
shall
think
it
very
bad
else
.
  
<EOS>
I
hold
my
hand
before
my
face
 
<EOS>
why
,
she
say
,
tell
me
,
wench
,
<EOS>
hast
thou
not
be
 
hesitating
 
a
very
free
creature
with
thy
master
?
 
<EOS>
that
she
say
,
or
to
that
effect
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
say
,
She
ask
strange
question
,
and
in
strange
word
,
she
ridicule
my
delicacy
,
as
she
call
it
;
and
say
,
My
niceness
would
not
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
I
must
know
I
be
not
really
married
,
that
my
ring
be
only
a
sham
,
and
all
be
my
cunning
to
cloak
my
yielding
,
and
get
well
term
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
She
know
the
world
as
much
at
thirty
-
two
,
as
I
do
at
sixteen
;
and
bid
me
remember
that
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
to
say
,
(
but
I
get
a
good
way
off
,
)
that
I
scorn
her
ladyship
's
word
,
and
be
as
much
married
as
her
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
have
certainly
be
cuff
,
if
her
woman
have
not
interpose
,
and
tell
her
I
be
not
worthy
her
anger
;
and
that
I
be
as
much
to
be
pity
for
my
credulity
,
as
despise
for
my
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
My
poor
Pamela
,
say
my
master
,
this
be
too
,
too
hard
upon
you
!
 
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
how
much
easy
it
be
to
me
than
if
it
have
be
so
!
 
<EOS>
that
would
have
break
my
heart
quite
!
 
<EOS>
for
then
I
should
have
deserve
it
all
,
and
bad
;
and
these
reproach
,
add
to
my
own
guilt
,
would
have
make
me
truly
wretched
!
  
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
,
at
whose
right
-
hand
<EOS>
I
sit
,
kiss
me
with
a
kind
of
rapture
,
and
call
me
a
sweet
exemplar
for
all
my
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
say
very
handsome
thing
;
so
do
Mr.
Perry
and
Sir
Simon
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
say
to
my
master
,
why
,
neighbour
,
neighbour
,
this
be
excellent
,
by
my
troth
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
something
in
virtue
,
that
we
have
not
well
consider
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
soul
,
there
have
be
but
one
angel
come
down
for
these
thousand
year
,
and
you
have
get
her
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
,
say
my
master
,
pray
proceed
with
your
story
until
,
we
have
do
supper
,
since
the
lady
seem
pleased
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
say
I
,
her
ladyship
go
on
in
the
same
manner
;
but
say
,
one
time
,
(
and
hold
me
by
the
hand
,
)
she
would
give
me
an
hundred
guinea
for
one
provoke
word
;
or
,
if
I
would
but
say
I
believe
myself
married
,
that
she
may
fell
me
at
her
foot
:
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
you
must
not
be
angry
with
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
She
call
me
paint
dirt
,
baby
-
face
,
waiting
-
maid
,
beggar
's
brat
,
and
beggar
-
bear
;
but
I
say
,
as
long
as
I
know
my
innocence
,
I
be
easy
in
every
thing
,
but
to
have
my
dear
parent
abuse
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
never
beggar
,
nor
beholden
to
any
body
;
nor
to
any
thing
but
God
's
grace
and
their
own
labour
;
that
they
once
live
in
credit
;
that
misfortune
may
befall
any
body
;
and
that
I
could
not
bear
they
should
be
treat
so
undeservedly
.
  
<EOS>
then
her
ladyship
say
,
ay
,
she
suppose
my
master
's
folly
would
make
us
set
up
for
a
family
,
and
that
the
herald
'
office
would
shortly
be
search
to
make
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
exactly
my
sister
again
!
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
could
not
please
her
any
way
?
  
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
command
me
to
fill
her
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
would
not
let
her
woman
do
it
,
she
ask
,
if
I
be
above
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
then
say
,
if
to
attend
your
ladyship
at
table
,
or
even
kneel
at
your
foot
,
be
require
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
would
most
gladly
do
it
,
be
I
only
the
person
you
think
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
to
triumph
over
one
,
who
have
receive
honour
which
she
think
require
from
her
another
part
,
that
she
may
not
be
utterly
unworthy
of
them
<EOS>
,
I
must
say
,
I
can
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
quite
astonish
her
ladyship
;
and
a
little
before
,
her
kinsman
bring
me
the
bottle
and
glass
,
and
require
me
to
fill
it
for
my
lady
,
at
her
command
,
and
call
himself
my
deputy
:
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
'
tis
in
a
good
hand
;
help
my
lady
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
sir
,
add
I
,
<EOS>
you
see
I
could
be
a
little
saucy
upon
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
You
please
me
well
,
my
Pamela
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
but
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
say
,
She
be
astonish
!
<EOS>
add
,
She
suppose
I
would
have
her
look
upon
me
as
her
brother
's
wife
:
and
ask
me
,
what
,
in
the
name
of
impudence
,
possess
me
,
to
dare
to
look
upon
myself
as
her
sister
?
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
that
be
a
question
better
become
her
most
worthy
brother
to
answer
,
than
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
think
I
should
have
have
her
ladyship
upon
me
;
but
her
woman
interpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
afterwards
tell
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
at
the
window
,
that
since
I
be
hinder
from
go
to
you
,
I
believe
it
be
good
to
let
Robert
go
with
the
chariot
,
and
say
,
Lady
Davers
be
come
,
and
I
could
not
leave
her
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
do
not
please
;
<EOS>
and
I
think
it
would
too
;
for
she
say
,
no
,
<EOS>
no
,
he
will
think
I
make
the
creature
my
companion
,
and
know
not
how
to
part
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
exactly
,
say
he
,
my
sister
again
.
  
<EOS>
and
she
say
,
I
know
nothing
what
belong
to
people
of
condition
;
how
should
I
?
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
,
madam
?
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
I.
 
nothing
at
all
,
answer
she
;
let
him
expect
his
dear
love
,
allude
to
your
kind
epithet
in
your
letter
,
and
be
disappoint
;
it
be
but
add
a
few
more
hour
to
this
heavy
absence
,
and
every
one
will
become
a
day
in
his
amorous
account
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
to
be
short
,
I
see
nothing
be
to
be
do
;
and
I
fear
,
sir
,
you
would
wonder
at
my
stay
,
and
be
angry
;
and
I
watch
my
opportunity
,
till
my
lady
,
who
be
walk
about
the
room
,
be
at
the
further
end
;
and
the
parlour
be
a
ground
-
floor
,
in
a
manner
,
I
jump
out
at
the
window
,
and
run
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
call
after
me
;
so
do
her
woman
;
and
I
hear
her
say
,
I
fly
like
a
bird
;
and
she
call
two
of
her
servant
in
sight
to
stop
me
;
but
I
say
,
touch
me
at
your
peril
,
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Colbrand
,
have
be
plant
at
hand
by
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
(
who
be
very
good
in
the
whole
affair
,
and
incur
her
ladyship
's
displeasure
,
once
or
twice
,
by
take
my
part
,
)
see
how
I
be
use
,
put
on
a
fierce
look
,
cock
his
hat
with
one
hand
,
and
put
t'other
on
his
sword
,
and
say
,
he
would
chine
the
man
who
offer
to
touch
his
lady
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
run
alongside
of
me
,
and
could
hardly
keep
pace
with
me
:
 
<EOS>
and
here
,
my
dear
sir
,
conclude
I
<EOS>
,
I
be
,
at
yours
and
the
good
company
's
service
.
  
<EOS>
They
seem
highly
pleased
with
my
relation
;
and
my
master
say
,
he
be
glad
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
behave
so
well
,
as
also
Mr.
Colbrand
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
I
:
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Jewkes
interpose
once
,
her
ladyship
say
,
It
be
hard
,
she
,
who
be
bear
in
that
house
,
could
not
have
some
privilege
in
it
,
without
be
talk
to
by
the
saucy
servant
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
call
her
another
time
fat
-
face
,
and
womane
her
most
violently
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
my
master
,
I
be
glad
,
my
dear
,
you
have
have
such
an
escape
.
<EOS>
My
sister
be
always
passionate
,
as
Mrs.
Peters
know
:
and
my
poor
mother
have
enough
to
do
with
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
for
we
neither
of
us
want
spirit
:
and
when
I
be
a
boy
,
I
never
come
home
from
school
or
college
for
a
few
day
,
but
though
we
long
to
see
one
another
before
,
yet
ere
the
first
day
be
over
,
we
have
a
quarrel
;
for
she
,
be
seven
year
old
than
I
,
be
always
for
domineer
over
me
,
and
I
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
use
,
on
her
frequently
quarrel
with
the
maid
,
and
be
always
at
a
word
and
a
blow
,
to
call
her
Captain
Bab
;
for
her
name
be
Barbara
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
my
Lord
Davers
court
her
,
my
poor
mother
have
make
up
quarrel
between
them
three
time
in
a
day
;
and
I
use
to
tell
her
<EOS>
,
she
would
certainly
beat
her
husband
,
marry
whom
she
would
,
if
he
do
not
beat
her
first
,
and
break
her
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
yet
have
she
,
continue
he
,
very
good
quality
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
dutiful
daughter
,
be
a
good
wife
;
she
be
bountiful
to
her
servant
,
firm
in
her
friendship
,
charitable
to
the
poor
,
and
,
I
believe
,
never
any
sister
better
love
a
brother
,
than
she
me
:
<EOS>
and
yet
she
always
love
to
vex
and
tease
me
;
and
as
I
would
bear
a
resentment
longer
than
she
,
she
would
be
one
moment
the
most
provoking
creature
in
the
world
,
and
the
next
would
do
any
thing
to
be
forgive
;
and
I
have
make
her
,
when
she
be
the
aggressor
,
follow
me
all
over
the
house
and
garden
to
be
upon
good
term
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
case
pique
her
more
,
because
she
have
find
out
a
match
for
me
in
the
family
of
a
person
of
quality
,
and
have
set
her
heart
upon
bring
it
to
effect
,
and
have
even
proceed
far
in
it
,
without
my
knowledge
,
and
bring
me
into
the
lady
's
company
,
unknowing
of
her
design
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
then
averse
to
matrimony
upon
any
term
;
and
be
angry
at
her
proceeding
in
it
so
far
without
my
privity
or
encouragement
:
<EOS>
and
she
can
not
,
for
this
reason
,
bear
the
thought
of
my
being
now
married
,
and
to
her
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
too
,
as
she
remind
my
dear
Pamela
,
when
I
have
decline
her
proposal
with
the
daughter
of
a
noble
earl
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
whole
case
,
say
he
;
and
,
allow
for
the
pride
and
violence
of
her
spirit
,
and
that
she
know
not
,
<EOS>
as
I
do
,
the
transcendent
excellency
of
my
dear
Pamela
,
and
that
all
her
view
,
in
her
own
conception
,
be
mine
and
the
family
honour
<EOS>
,
she
be
a
little
to
be
allow
for
:
though
,
never
fear
,
my
Pamela
,
but
that
I
,
who
never
have
a
struggle
with
her
,
wherein
I
do
not
get
the
well
,
will
do
you
justice
,
and
myself
too
.
  
<EOS>
this
account
of
Lady
Davers
please
every
body
,
and
be
far
from
be
to
her
ladyship
's
disadvantage
in
the
main
;
and
I
would
do
any
thing
in
the
world
to
have
the
honour
to
be
in
her
good
grace
:
<EOS>
yet
I
fear
it
will
not
be
easily
,
if
at
all
,
effect
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
after
supper
,
nothing
would
serve
Miss
Darnford
and
Miss
Boroughs
,
but
we
must
have
a
dance
;
and
Mr.
Peters
,
who
play
a
good
fiddle
,
urge
it
forward
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
master
,
though
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
take
out
Miss
Boroughs
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
,
for
a
man
of
his
year
,
dance
well
,
and
take
me
out
;
but
put
on
one
of
his
free
joke
,
that
I
be
fitter
to
dance
with
a
young
man
;
and
he
would
have
it
,
(
though
I
have
not
dance
since
my
dear
lady
's
death
to
signify
,
except
once
or
twice
to
please
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
,
indeed
,
believe
all
my
dancing
day
over
,
)
that
as
my
master
and
I
be
the
good
dancer
,
we
should
dance
once
together
,
before
folk
,
as
the
odd
gentleman
say
;
and
my
dear
sir
be
pleased
to
oblige
him
:
and
afterwards
dance
with
Miss
Darnford
,
who
have
much
more
skill
and
judgment
than
I
;
though
they
compliment
me
with
an
easy
shape
and
air
.
  
<EOS>
We
leave
the
company
with
great
difficulty
at
about
eleven
,
my
dear
master
have
be
up
all
night
before
,
and
we
be
at
the
great
distance
from
home
;
though
they
seem
inclinable
not
to
break
up
so
soon
,
as
they
be
neighbour
;
and
the
lady
say
,
They
long
to
hear
what
would
be
the
end
of
Lady
Davers
's
interview
with
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
say
,
He
fear
we
must
not
now
think
of
go
next
day
to
Bedfordshire
,
as
we
have
intend
;
and
perhaps
may
see
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
take
leave
,
and
set
out
for
home
;
where
we
arrive
not
till
twelve
o'clock
;
and
find
Lady
Davers
have
go
to
bed
about
eleven
,
want
sadly
that
we
should
come
home
first
;
but
so
do
not
I.
  
Mrs.
Jewkes
tell
us
,
that
my
lady
be
sadly
fret
that
I
have
get
away
so
;
and
seem
a
little
apprehensive
of
what
I
would
say
of
the
usage
I
have
receive
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
if
she
think
I
be
really
married
?
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
jewke
tell
her
<EOS>
yes
,
she
fall
into
a
passion
,
and
say
,
Begone
,
bold
woman
,
I
can
not
bear
thee
!
 
<EOS>
see
not
my
face
till
I
send
for
thee
!
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
be
very
impudent
to
me
once
or
twice
to
-
day
already
,
and
art
now
bad
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
She
would
not
have
tell
her
ladyship
,
if
she
have
not
ask
her
;
and
be
sorry
she
have
offend
.
  
<EOS>
She
send
for
her
at
supper
time
:
say
she
,
I
have
another
question
to
ask
thee
,
woman
,
and
tell
me
yes
,
if
thou
darest
.
 
<EOS>
be
ever
any
thing
so
odd
?
 
<EOS>
why

,
say
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
I
will
say
<EOS>
no
,
before
your

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
She

and
say
,

but

.
 
<EOS>
Dost

<EOS>
but
at
last
my
lady
say
,
I
will
know

bottom
of
this
iniquity
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
will
not
have
so
much
impudence
to
be
together
while
I
be
in
the
house
;
but
I
dare
say

<EOS>
set

My

but
,
if

.
  
<EOS>
o

!
<EOS>
say
I
;
I
should
not
forgive
myself
,
if
I

.
 
<EOS>
I
would
on
my
knee
beg
her
ladyship
's
goodness
to
me
,
now
I
be
in
your
presence
;
though
I
think
I
ought
to
carry
it
a
little
stiff
when
you
be
absent
,
for
the
sake
of
the
honour
you
have
do
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
dear
sir
,
if
my
deep
humility
will
please
,
permit
me
to
shew
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
shall
do
nothing
,
return
he
,
unworthy
of
my
wife
,
to
please
the
proud
woman
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
,
however
,
permit
you
to
breakfast
by
yourself
this
once
,
as
I
have
not
see
her
since
I
have
use
her
in
so
barbarous
a
manner
,
as
I
understand
she
exclaim
I
have
;
and
as
she
will
not
eat
any
thing
,
unless
I
give
her
my
company
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
salute
me
,
and
withdraw
;
and
I
lock
the
door
after
him
again
for
fear
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
soon
after
rap
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
there
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
<EOS>
only
I
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
sad
thing
,
madam
,
say
she
,
you
should
be
so
much
afraid
in
your
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
bring
me
some
chocolate
and
toast
;
and
I
ask
her
about
my
lady
's
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
would
not
suffer
any
body
to
attend
but
her
woman
,
because
she
would
not
be
hear
what
she
have
to
say
;
but
she
believe
,
she
say
,
her
master
be
very
angry
with
the
young
lord
,
as
she
call
her
kinsman
;
for
,
as
she
pass
by
the
door
,
she
hear
him
say
,
in
a
high
tone
,
I
hope
,
sir
,
you
do
not
forget
what
belong
to
the
character
you
assume
;
or
to
that
effect
.
  
<EOS>
about
one
o'clock
my
master
come
up
again
,
and
he
say
,
Will
you
come
down
to
dinner
,
Pamela
,
when
I
send
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
whatever
you
command
,
sir
,
I
must
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
lady
will
not
desire
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
whether
she
will
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
suffer
,
that
she
shall
prescribe
her
insolent
will
to
my
wife
,
and
in
your
own
house
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
by
my
tenderness
to
you
,
mortify
her
pride
;
and
it
can
not
be
do
so
well
as
to
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
dearest
sir
,
say
I
,
pray
indulge
me
,
and
let
me
dine
here
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
make
my
lady
but
more
inveterate
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
,
I
have
tell
her
we
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
out
of
all
patience
about
it
,
and
yet
pretend
not
to
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
upon
that
I
tell
her
,
then
she
shall
have
it
her
own
way
,
and
that
I
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
have
she
to
do
with
it
either
way
?
 
<EOS>
She
have
scold
and
beg
,
command
and
pray
,
bless
me
,
and
curse
me
,
by
turn
,
twenty
time
in
these
few
hour
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
sometimes
soothe
her
,
sometimes
rage
;
and
at
last
leave
her
,
and
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
for
an
hour
to
compose
myself
,
because
you
should
not
see
how
the
foolish
woman
have
ruffle
me
;
and
just
now
I
come
out
,
see
her
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
he
have
say
so
,
I
cry
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
lady
,
my
lady
!
<EOS>
for
I
hear
her
voice
in
the
chamber
,
say
,
Brother
,
brother
,
one
word
with
you
 
stop
in
sight
of
the
closet
where
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
step
out
,
and
she
go
up
to
the
window
that
look
towards
the
garden
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
Mean
fool
that
I
be
,
to
follow
you
up
and
down
the
house
in
this
manner
,
though
I
be
shun
and
avoid
by
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
a
brother
!
 
<EOS>
You
a
barbarian
!
 
<EOS>
be
it
possible
<EOS>
we
could
be
bear
of
one
mother
?
  
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
do
you
charge
me
with
a
conduct
to
you
,
that
you
bring
upon
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
surprising
that
you
should
take
the
liberty
with
me
,
that
the
dear
mother
you
have
name
never
give
you
an
example
for
to
any
of
her
relation
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
sufficient
,
that
I
be
insolently
take
to
task
by
you
in
your
letter
,
but
my
retirement
must
be
invade
?
 
<EOS>
My
house
insult
?
 
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
have
one
person
dearer
to
me
than
another
,
that
that
person
must
be
single
out
for
an
object
of
your
violence
?
  
<EOS>
ay
,
say
she
,
that
one
person
be
the
thing
!
 
<EOS>
but
though
I
come
with
a
resolution
to
be
temperate
,
and
to
expostulate
with
you
on
your
avoid
me
so
unkindly
,
yet
can
not
I
have
patience
to
look
upon
that
bed
in
which
I
be
bear
,
and
to
be
make
the
guilty
scene
of
your
wickedness
with
such
a
   
Hush
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
I
charge
you
!
<EOS>
call
not
the
dear
girl
by
any
name
unworthy
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
not
,
as
I
tell
you
,
her
excellence
;
<EOS>
and
I
desire
you
will
not
repeat
the
freedom
you
have
take
below
.
  
<EOS>
She
stamp
with
her
foot
,
and
say
,
God
give
me
patience
!
 
<EOS>
so
much
contempt
to
a
sister
that
love
you
so
well
;
and
so
much
tenderness
to
a
vile
     
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
before
her
mouth
:
be
silent
,
say
he
,
once
more
,
I
charge
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
not
the
innocence
you
abuse
so
freely
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
not
,
neither
will
I
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
down
and
fan
herself
,
and
burst
into
tear
,
and
such
sobs
of
grief
,
or
rather
passion
,
that
grieve
me
to
hear
;
and
I
sit
and
tremble
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
He
walk
about
the
room
in
great
anger
;
and
at
last
say
,
let
me
ask
you
,
Lady
Davers
,
why
I
be
thus
insolently
to
be
call
to
account
by
you
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
not
independent
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
not
of
age
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
not
at
liberty
to
please
myself
?
 
<EOS>
Would
to
God
,
that
,
instead
of
a
woman
,
and
my
sister
,
any
man
breathing
have
dare
,
whatever
be
his
relation
under
that
of
a
father
,
to
give
himself
half
the
air
you
have
do
!
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
not
send
on
this
accurse
<EOS>
errand
your
lord
,
who
could
write
me
such
a
letter
as
no
gentleman
should
write
,
nor
any
gentleman
tamely
receive
?
 
<EOS>
He
should
have
see
the
difference
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
know
,
say
she
,
that
,
since
your
italian
duel
,
you
have
commence
a
bravo
;
and
all
your
air
breathe
as
strongly
of
the
manslayer
as
of
the
libertine
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
say
he
,
I
will
bear
;
for
I
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
that
duel
,
nor
the
cause
of
it
;
since
it
be
to
save
a
friend
,
and
because
it
be
level
at
myself
only
:
but
suffer
not
your
tongue
to
take
too
great
a
liberty
with
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
She
interrupt
him
in
a
violent
burst
of
passion
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
bear
this
,
say
she
,
I
can
bear
any
thing
!
 
<EOS>
o
the
little
strumpet
!
 
<EOS>
He
interrupt
her
then
,
and
say
wrathfully
,
Begone
,
rageful
woman
!
<EOS>
begone
this
moment
from
my
presence
!
 
<EOS>
leave
my
house
this
instant
!
 
<EOS>
I
renounce
you
,
and
all
relation
to
you
!
<EOS>
and
never
more
let
me
see
your
face
,
or
call
me
brother
!
<EOS>
and
take
her
by
the
hand
to
lead
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
hold
of
the
curtain
of
the
window
,
and
say
,
I
will
not
go
!
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
force
me
from
you
thus
ignominiously
in
the
wretch
's
hearing
,
and
suffer
her
to
triumph
over
me
in
your
barbarous
treatment
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
not
consider
any
thing
,
I
run
out
of
the
closet
,
and
throw
myself
at
my
dear
master
's
foot
,
as
he
hold
her
hand
,
in
order
to
lead
her
out
;
and
I
say
,
Dearest
sir
,
let
me
beg
,
that
no
act
of
unkindness
,
for
my
sake
,
pass
between
so
worthy
and
so
near
relation
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
madam
,
say
I
,
and
clasp
her
knee
,
pardon
and
excuse
the
unhappy
cause
of
all
this
evil
;
on
my
knee
I
beg
your
ladyship
to
receive
me
to
your
grace
and
favour
,
and
you
shall
find
me
incapable
of
any
triumph
but
<EOS>
in
your
ladyship
's
goodness
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Creature
,
say
she
,
art
thou
to
beg
an
excuse
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
Art
thou
to
implore
my
forgiveness
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
to
thee
<EOS>
I
be
to
owe
the
favour
,
that
I
be
not
cast
headlong
from
my
brother
's
presence
?
 
<EOS>
Begone
to
thy
corner
,
wench
!
<EOS>
begone
,
I
say
,
lest
thy
paramour
kill
me
for
trample
thee
under
my
foot
!
  
<EOS>
rise
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
say
my
master
;
rise
,
dear
life
of
my
life
;
and
expose
not
so
much
worthiness
to
the
ungrateful
scorn
of
so
violent
a
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
lead
me
to
my
closet
again
,
and
there
I
sit
and
weep
.
  
<EOS>
Her
woman
come
up
,
just
as
he
have
lead
me
to
my
closet
,
and
be
return
to
her
lady
;
and
she
very
humbly
say
,
excuse
my
intrusion
,
good
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
come
to
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Mrs.
Worden
,
say
he
,
you
may
come
in
;
and
pray
take
your
lady
down
stair
with
you
,
for
fear
I
should
too
much
forget
what
belong
either
to
my
sister
or
myself
!
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
(
see
her
ladyship
so
outrageous
with
her
brother
)
<EOS>
what
a
happy
escape
I
have
have
the
day
before
,
though
hardly
enough
use
in
conscience
too
,
as
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
Her
woman
beg
her
ladyship
to
walk
down
;
and
she
say
,
Beck
,
seest
thou
that
bed
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
bed
that
I
be
bear
in
;
and
yet
that
be
the
bed
thou
sawest
,
as
well
as
I
,
the
wicked
Pamela
in
,
this
morning
,
and
this
brother
of
mine
just
rise
from
her
!
  
<EOS>
true
,
say
he
;
you
both
see
it
,
and
it
be
my
pride
that
you
could
see
it
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
my
bridal
bed
;
and
'
tis
abominable
that
the
happiness
I
know
before
you
come
hither
,
should
be
so
barbarously
interrupt
.
  
<EOS>
swear
to
me
<EOS>
but
,
thou
bold
wretch
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
swear
to
me
,
that
Pamela
Andrews
be
really
and
truly
thy
lawful
wife
,
without
sham
,
without
deceit
,
without
double
-
meaning
;
and
I
know
what
I
have
to
say
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
humour
you
for
once
,
say
he
;
and
then
swear
a
solemn
oath
that
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
say
he
,
do
I
not
tell
you
so
at
first
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
yet
believe
you
,
say
she
;
because
,
in
this
particular
,
I
have
rather
have
call
you
knave
than
fool
.
 
<EOS>
provoke
me
not
too
much
,
say
he
;
for
,
if
I
should
as
much
forget
myself
as
you
have
do
<EOS>
,
you
would
have
no
more
of
a
brother
in
me
,
than
I
have
a
sister
in
you
.
  
<EOS>
who
marry
you
?
<EOS>
say
she
:
tell
me
that
!
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
a
broken
attorney
in
a
parson
's
habit
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
truly
,
in
the
wench
's
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
be
undeceived
,
she
will
know
how
to
behave
herself
better
!
 
<EOS>
thank
God
,
think
I
,
it
be
not
so
.
  
<EOS>
no
,
say
he
;
and
I
will
tell
you
,
that
I
bless
God
<EOS>
,
I
abhor
that
project
,
before
it
be
bring
to
bear
:
and
Mr.
Williams
marry
us
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
then
,
say
she
 
<EOS>
but
answer
me
another
question
or
two
,
I
beseech
you
:
<EOS>
who
give
her
away
?
 
<EOS>
Parson
Peters
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
the
ceremony
perform
?
 
<EOS>
in
my
little
chapel
,
which
you
may
see
,
as
it
be
put
in
order
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
say
she
,
I
begin
to
fear
there
be
something
in
it
!
 
<EOS>
but
who
be
present
?
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
,
reply
he
,
I
look
like
a
fine
puppy
,
to
suffer
myself
to
be
thus
interrogate
by
an
insolent
sister
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
must
know
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
o
the
procuress
!
<EOS>
say
she
:
<EOS>
but
nobody
else
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
he
,
all
my
heart
and
soul
!
  
<EOS>
wretch
!
say
she
;
and
what
would
thy
father
and
mother
have
say
,
have
they
live
to
this
day
?
 
<EOS>
Their
consent
,
reply
he
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
think
it
my
duty
to
ask
;
but
not
yours
,
madam
.
  
<EOS>
Suppose
,
say
she
,
I
have
marry
my
father
's
groom
!
<EOS>
what
would
you
have
say
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
behave
worse
,
reply
he
,
than
you
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
would
you
not
have
think
,
say
she
,
I
have
deserve
it
.
  
<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>
,
do
your
pride
let
you
see
no
difference
in
the
case
you
put
?
<EOS>
none
at
all
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
where
can
the
difference
be
between
a
beggar
's
son
marry
by
a
lady
,
or
a
beggar
's
daughter
<EOS>
make
a
gentleman
's
wife
?
  
<EOS>
then
I
will
tell
you
,
reply
he
;
<EOS>
the
difference
be
,
a
man
ennoble
the
woman
he
take
,
be
she
who
she
will
;
and
adopt
her
into
his
own
rank
,
be
it
<EOS>
what
it
will
:
but
a
woman
,
though
ever
so
nobly
bear
,
debase
herself
by
a
mean
marriage
,
and
descend
from
her
own
rank
to
his
<EOS>
she
stoop
to
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
royal
family
of
Stuart
ally
itself
into
the
low
family
of
Hyde
,
(
comparatively
low
,
I
mean
,
)
do
any
body
scruple
to
call
the
lady
,
Royal
Highness
,
and
Duchess
of
York
?
 
<EOS>
and
do
any
body
think
her
daughter
,
the
late
Queen
Mary
and
Queen
Anne
,
less
royal
for
that
?
  
<EOS>
when
the
break
-
fortune
peer
go
into
the
city
to
marry
a
rich
tradesman
's
daughter
,
be
he
duke
or
earl
,
do
not
his
consort
immediately
become
ennobled
by
his
choice
?
<EOS>
and
who
scruple
to
call
her
lady
,
duchess
,
or
countess
?
  
<EOS>
but
when
a
duchess
or
countess
dowager
descend
to
mingle
with
a
person
of
obscure
birth
,
do
she
not
then
degrade
herself
?
<EOS>
and
be
she
not
effectually
degrade
?
 
<EOS>
and
will
any
duchess
or
countess
rank
with
her
?
  
<EOS>
now
,
Lady
Davers
,
do
you
not
see
a
difference
between
my
marry
my
dear
mother
's
beloved
and
deserve
waiting
-
maid
,
with
a
million
of
excellency
about
her
,
and
such
grace
of
mind
and
person
as
would
adorn
any
distinction
;
and
your
marry
a
sordid
groom
,
whose
constant
train
of
education
,
conversation
,
and
opportunity
,
could
possibly
give
him
no
other
merit
,
than
that
which
must
proceed
from
the
vile
,
low
taste
,
in
his
sordid
dignifier
?
  
<EOS>
o
the
wretch
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
how
he
find
excuse
to
palliate
his
meanness
!
  
<EOS>
again
,
say
he
,
let
me
observe
to
you
,
Lady
Davers
,
when
a
duke
marry
a
private
person
,
be
he
not
still
her
head
,
by
virtue
of
be
her
husband
?
<EOS>
but
,
when
a
lady
descend
to
marry
a
groom
,
be
not
the
groom
her
head
,
be
her
husband
?
 
<EOS>
and
do
not
the
difference
strike
you
?
 
<EOS>
for
what
lady
of
quality
ought
to
respect
another
,
who
have
make
so
sordid
a
choice
,
and
set
a
groom
above
her
?
 
<EOS>
for
,
would
not
that
be
to
put
that
groom
upon
a
par
with
themselves
?
 
<EOS>
call
this
palliation
,
or
what
you
will
;
but
if
you
see
not
the
difference
,
you
be
blind
;
and
a
very
unfit
judge
for
yourself
,
much
more
unfit
to
be
a
censurer
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
,
say
she
,
publish
your
fine
reason
to
the
world
,
and
they
will
be
sweet
encouragement
to
all
the
young
gentleman
who
read
them
to
cast
themselves
away
on
the
servant
-
wench
in
their
family
.
  
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
Lady
Davers
,
reply
he
:
<EOS>
for
,
if
any
young
gentleman
stay
till
he
find
such
a
person
as
my
Pamela
,
so
enrich
with
the
beauty
of
person
and
mind
,
so
well
accomplished
,
and
so
fit
to
adorn
the
degree
she
be
raise
to
,
he
will
stand
as
easily
acquit
,
as
I
shall
be
to
all
the
world
that
see
her
,
except
there
be
many
more
Lady
Davers
than
I
apprehend
can
possibly
be
meet
with
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
return
she
,
you
say
you
be
actually
and
really
married
,
honestly
,
or
rather
<EOS>
foolishly
married
,
to
this
slut
?
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
indeed
,
say
he
,
if
you
presume
to
call
her
so
!
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
I
not
,
if
I
please
?
 
<EOS>
who
be
there
ought
to
contradict
me
?
 
<EOS>
whom
have
I
hurt
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
have
I
not
an
estate
,
free
and
independent
?
 
<EOS>
be
I
likely
to
be
behold
to
you
,
or
any
of
my
relation
?
 
<EOS>
and
why
,
when
I
have
a
sufficiency
in
my
own
single
hand
,
should
I
scruple
to
make
a
woman
equally
happy
,
who
have
all
I
want
?
 
<EOS>
for
beauty
,
virtue
,
prudence
,
and
generosity
too
,
I
will
tell
you
,
she
have
more
than
any
lady
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
yes
,
Lady
Davers
,
she
have
all
these
naturally
;
they
be
bear
with
her
;
and
a
few
year
'
education
,
with
her
genius
,
have
do
more
for
her
,
than
a
whole
life
have
do
for
other
.
  
<EOS>
no
more
,
no
more
,
I
beseech
you
,
say
she
;
thou
surfeit
me
,
honest
man
!
<EOS>
with
thy
weak
folly
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
art
bad
than
an
idolater
<EOS>
;
thou
hast
make
a
graven
image
,
and
thou
fallest
down
and
worshippest
the
work
of
thy
own
hand
;
and
,
Jeroboam
-
like
,
wouldst
have
every
body
else
bow
down
before
thy
calf
!
  
<EOS>
well
say
,
Lady
Davers
!
 
<EOS>
whenever
your
passion
suffer
you
to
descend
to
witticism
;
'
tis
almost
over
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
me
tell
you
,
though
I
myself
worship
this
sweet
creature
,
that
you
call
such
name
,
I
want
nobody
else
to
do
it
;
and
should
be
glad
you
have
not
intrude
upon
me
,
to
interrupt
me
in
the
course
of
our
mutual
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
well
say
,
well
say
,
my
kind
,
my
well
-
mannered
brother
!
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
after
this
,
very
little
interrupt
your
mutual
happiness
<EOS>
,
I
will
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
a
gentleman
once
,
and
pride
myself
in
my
brother
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
say
now
with
the
burial
service
,
Ashes
to
ashe
,
and
dirt
to
dirt
!
  
<EOS>
ay
,
say
he
,
Lady
Davers
,
and
there
we
must
all
end
at
last
;
you
with
all
your
pride
,
and
I
with
my
plentiful
fortune
,
must
come
to
it
;
and
then
where
will
be
your
distinction
?
 
<EOS>
let
me
tell
you
,
except
you
and
I
both
mend
our
manner
,
though
you
have
be
no
duellist
,
no
libertine
,
as
you
call
me
,
this
amiable
girl
,
whom
your
vanity
and
folly
so
much
despise
,
will
out
-
soar
us
both
,
infinitely
out
-
soar
us
;
and
he
who
judge
best
,
will
give
the
preference
where
due
,
without
regard
to
birth
or
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
egregious
preacher
!
<EOS>
say
she
:
<EOS>
what
,
my
brother
already
turn
Puritan
!
  
<EOS>
see
what
marriage
and
repentance
may
bring
a
man
to
!
 
<EOS>
I
heartily
congratulate
this
change
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
(
and
come
towards
me
,
and
I
tremble
to
see
her
come
;
but
her
brother
follow
to
observe
her
,
and
I
stand
up
at
her
approach
,
and
she
say
,
)
give
me
thy
hand
,
Mrs.
Pamela
,
Mrs.
Andrews
,
Mrs.
what
shall
I
call
thee
?
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
do
wonder
in
a
little
time
;
thou
hast
not
only
make
a
rake
<EOS>
a
husband
but
thou
hast
make
a
rake
a
preacher
!
 
<EOS>
but
take
care
,
add
she
,
after
all
,
in
ironical
anger
,
and
tap
me
on
the
neck
,
take
care
that
thy
vanity
begin
not
where
his
end
;
and
that
thou
callest
not
thyself
my
sister
.
  
<EOS>
She
shall
,
I
hope
,
Lady
Davers
,
say
he
,
when
she
can
make
as
great
a
convert
of
you
from
pride
,
as
she
have
of
me
,
from
libertinism
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
just
then
come
up
,
and
say
dinner
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
my
Pamela
,
say
my
dear
master
;
you
desire
to
be
excuse
from
breakfast
with
us
;
but
I
hope
you
will
give
Lady
Davers
and
me
your
company
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
how
dare
you
insult
me
thus
?
<EOS>
say
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
how
dare
you
,
say
he
,
insult
me
by
your
conduct
in
my
own
house
,
after
I
have
tell
you
I
be
married
?
<EOS>
how
dare
you
think
of
stay
here
one
moment
,
and
refuse
my
wife
the
honour
that
belong
to
her
as
such
?
  
<EOS>
merciful
God
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
give
me
patience
!
<EOS>
and
hold
her
hand
to
her
forehead
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
dear
sir
,
say
I
,
excuse
me
,
do
not
vex
my
lady
:
 
<EOS>
be
silent
,
my
dear
love
,
say
he
<EOS>
;
you
see
already
what
you
have
get
by
your
sweet
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
throw
yourself
at
her
foot
,
and
,
insolent
as
she
be
,
she
have
threaten
to
trample
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
ask
you
,
presently
,
if
she
be
to
owe
her
excuse
to
your
interposition
?
<EOS>
and
yet
nothing
else
can
make
her
forgive
.
  
<EOS>
poor
lady
,
she
could
not
bear
this
;
and
,
as
if
she
be
discompose
,
she
run
to
her
poor
grieved
woman
,
and

<EOS>
She

for
your

.
  
<EOS>
You

not
do
well
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
You
neither
treat
me
like
your
brother
nor
a
gentleman
;
and
if
you
would
suffer
me
,
I
would
love
you
as
well
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
b
ut
for
a
woman
of
sense
and
understanding
,
and
a
fine
-
breed
woman
,
<EOS>
as
I
once
think
my
sister
,
you
act
quite
a
childish
part
.
 
<EOS>
Come

add
he
,
and
hold
the
glass
to
her
lip
,
let
your

<EOS>
You

begin
to
recollect
herself

and
do
not
behave
half
so
ill
before
the
servant
,
as
she
have
do
;
and
help
herself
with
some
little
freedom
;
but
she
could
not
forbear
a
strong
sigh
and
a
sob
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
call
for
a
glass
of
the
same
wine

drink

<EOS>
say
he
<EOS>

Shall

.
  
<EOS>
be
thy

along
with
thee
,
friend

<EOS>
say

.
 
<EOS>
yes

to
be

,
answer
he
,
my
dear
Quaker
sister
;
and
take
her
hand
,
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
and
would'st
have
me
parade
it
with
her
on
the
road
?
  
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
and
make
one
to
grace
her
retinue
?
 
<EOS>
hey
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
how
thoud'st

it
out
,
if
I
would

as
<EOS>
thou
would'st
have
me
,
honest
friend
?
  
<EOS>
He
clasp
his
arm
about
her
,
and
kiss
her
:
<EOS>
You

a
dear
saucy
sister
,
say
he
;
but
I
must
love
you
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
will
tell
you
how
I
would
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
here
shall
you
,
and
<EOS>
my
Pamela
 
leave
out
my
<EOS>
,
I
desire
you
,
if
you
would
have
me
sit
patiently
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
reply
he
,
I
can
not
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
here
shall
you
,
and
my
Pamela
,
go
together
in
your
chariot
,
if
you
please
;
and
she
will
then
appear
as
one
of
your
retinue
;
and
your
nephew
and
I
will
sometimes
ride
,
and
sometimes
go
into
my
chariot
,
to
your
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Should'st
thou
like
this
,
creature
?
<EOS>
say
she
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
your
ladyship
think
it
not
too
great
an
honour
for
me
,
madam
,
say
I.
 
yes
,
reply
she
,
but
my
ladyship
do
think
it
would
be
too
great
an
honour
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
think
of
it
,
say
he
,
this
must
not
be
neither
;
for
,
without
you
would
give
her
the
hand
in
your
own
chariot
,
my
wife
would
be
think
your
woman
,
and
that
must
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
that
would
,
may
be
,
say
she
,
be
the
only
inducement
for
me
to
bear
her
near
me
,
in
my
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
how
then
?
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
when
we
come
home
,
we
would
get
Lord
Davers
to
come
to
us
,
and
stay
a
month
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
and
what
if
he
be
to
come
?
 
<EOS>
why
I
would
have
you
,
as
I
know
you
have
a
good
fancy
,
give
Pamela
your
judgment
on
some
pattern
I
expect
from
London
,
for
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
provoking
wretch
!
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
;
now
I
wish
I
may
keep
my
hand
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
it
to
provoke
you
,
say
he
,
nor
ought
it
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
tell
you
I
be
married
,
be
it
not
a
consequence
that
we
must
have
new
clothe
?
  
<EOS>
Hast
thou
any
more
of
these
oblige
thing
to
say
to
me
,
friend
?
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
you
a
present
,
return
he
,
worth
your
acceptance
,
if
you
will
grace
us
with
your
company
at
church
,
when
we
make
our
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
take
<EOS>
that
,
say
she
,
if
I
die
for
it
,
wretch
that
thou
art
!
<EOS>
and
be
go
to
hit
him
a
great
slap
;
but
he
hold
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Her
kinsman
say
,
dear
aunt
,
I
wonder
at
you
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
all
these
be
thing
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
leave
to
withdraw
;
and
,
as
I
go
out
,
my
good
master
say
,
there
be
a
person
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
shape
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
sweetness
!
 
<EOS>
o
,
Lady
Davers
!
<EOS>
be
you
a
man
,
you
would
doat
on
her
,
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
the
naughty
lady
,
so
I
should
,
for
my
harlot
,
but
not
for
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
turn
,
on
this
,
and
say
,
indeed
your
ladyship
be
cruel
;
and
well
may
gentleman
take
liberty
,
when
lady
of
honour
say
such
thing
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
weep
,
and
add
,
Your
ladyship
's
inference
,
<EOS>
if
your
good
brother
be
not
the
most
generous
of
man
,
would
make
me
very
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
no
fear
,
wench
<EOS>
;
no
fear
,
say
she
;
thou'lt
hold
him
as
long
as
any
body
can
,
I
see
that
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Sally
Godfrey
never
have
half
the
interest
in
him
,
I
will
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
stay
,
my
Pamela
,
say
he
,
in
a
passion
;
stay
,
when
I
bid
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
now
hear
two
vile
charge
upon
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
with
such
a
true
affection
,
that
I
ought
to
say
something
before
this
malicious
accuser
,
that
you
may
not
think
your
consummate
virtue
link
to
<EOS>
so
black
a
villain
.
  
<EOS>
Her
nephew
seem
uneasy
,
and
blame
her
much
;
and
I
come
back
,
but
tremble
as
I
stand
;
and
he
set
me
down
,
and
say
,
take
my
hand
,
I
have
be
accuse
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
as
a
dueller
,
and
now
as
a
profligate
,
in
another
sense
;
and
there
be
a
time
I
should
not
have
receive
these
imputation
with
so
much
concern
as
I
now
do
,
when
I
would
wish
,
by
degree
,
by
a
conformity
of
my
manner
to
your
virtue
,
to
shew
every
one
<EOS>
the
force
your
example
have
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
briefly
be
the
case
of
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
friend
,
who
have
be
basely
attempt
to
be
assassinate
by
bravo
,
hire
by
a
man
of
title
in
Italy
,
who
,
like
many
other
person
of
title
,
have
no
honour
;
and
,
at
Padua
,
I
have
the
fortune
to
disarm
one
of
these
bravo
in
my
friend
's
defence
,
and
make
him
confess
his
employer
;
and
him
,
I
own
,
I
challenge
.
 
<EOS>
at
Sienna
we
meet
,
and
he
die
in
a
month
after
,
of
a
fever
;
but
,
I
hope
,
not
occasion
by
the
slight
wound
he
have
receive
from
me
;
though
I
be
oblige
to
leave
Italy
upon
it
,
sooner
than
I
intend
,
because
of
his
numerous
relation
,
who
look
upon
me
as
the
cause
of
his
death
;
though
I
pacify
them
by
a
letter
I
write
them
from
Inspruck
,
acquaint
them
with
the
baseness
of
the
deceased
:
and
they
follow
me
not
to
Munich
,
as
they
intend
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
good
-
natured
hint
that
may
shock
your
sweetness
,
on
reflect
that
you
be
yoke
with
a
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
 
Nay
,
brother
,
say
she
,
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
your
own
fault
<EOS>
if
you
go
further
.
 
<EOS>
She
shall
know
it
all
,
say
he
;
and
I
defy
the
utmost
stretch
of
your
malice
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
at
college
,
I
be
well
receive
by
a
widow
lady
,
who
have
several
daughter
,
and
but
small
fortune
to
give
them
;
and
the
old
lady
set
one
of
them
(
a
deserve
good
girl
she
be
,
)
to
draw
me
into
marriage
with
her
,
for
the
sake
of
the
fortune
I
be
heir
to
;
and
contrive
many
opportunity
to
bring
us
and
leave
us
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
then
of
age
;
and
the
young
lady
,
not
half
so
artful
as
her
mother
,
yield
to
my
address
before
the
mother
's
plot
could
be
ripen
,
and
so
utterly
disappointed
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
my
Pamela
,
be
the
Sally
Godfrey
,
this
malicious
woman
,
with
the
bad
intention
,
have
inform
you
of
.
 
<EOS>
and
whatever
other
liberty
I
may
have
take
,
(
for
perhaps
some
more
I
have
,
which
,
have
she
know
<EOS>
,
you
have
hear
of
,
as
well
as
this
,
)
<EOS>
I
desire
Heaven
will
only
forgive
me
,
till
I
revive
its
vengeance
by
the
like
offence
,
in
injury
to
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
,
you

<EOS>
I

.
 
<EOS>
Will

<EOS>

I
desire
,
say

that
you
will

<EOS>
I

<EOS>

,
say

,
<EOS>
I
desire
to
see
neither
of
you
,
on
such
an
occasion
;
and
let

for
I
will
not

;
and
be

away
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
say

,
one
word
first
,
I
desire
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
forgive
me
,
I
will
forgive
you
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
say
the
dear
man
,
haughtily
,
will
you
forgive
me
?
 
<EOS>
why

say
she
,
for
she
see
him
too
angry
to
mention
his
marriage
,
as
a
subject
that
require
her
pardon
 
<EOS>
I
will
forgive

<EOS>
I
will
be
serious
with
you

:
I
wish

,
study
so
much
one
<EOS>
another
be
quiet
,
as
never
to
come
near
one
another
more
.
 
<EOS>
never
?
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
and
can
you
desire
this
?
<EOS>
barbarous
brother
!
<EOS>
can
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
,
I
do
,
say
he
;
and
I
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
hide
from
you
,
not
a
brother
,
but
a
murderer
,
and
a
profligate
,
unworthy
of
your
relation
;
and
let
me
be
consign
to
penitence
for
my
past
evil
:
<EOS>
a
penitence
,
however
,
that
shall
not
be
break
in
upon
by
so
violent
an
accuser
.
  
<EOS>
Pamela
,
say
he
,
and
make
me
tremble
,
how
dare
you
approach
me
,
without
leave
,
when
you
see
me
thus
disturb
?
 
<EOS>
never
,
for
the
future
,
come
near
me
,
when
I
be
in
these
tumult
,
unless
I
send
for
you
.
  
<EOS>
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
say
I
 
<EOS>
leave
me
,
interrupt
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
set
out
for
Bedfordshire
this
moment
!
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
I
,
without
me
?
 
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
too
meanly
,
say
he
,
for
my
wife
,
stoop
to
this
furious
sister
of
mine
;
and
,
till
I
can
recollect
,
I
be
not
pleased
with
you
:
<EOS>
but
Colbrand
shall
attend
you
,
and
two
other
of
my
servant
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
shall
wait
upon
you
part
of
the
way
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
will
find
me
in
a
well
disposition
to
receive
you
there
,
than
I
be
at
part
with
you
here
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
not
hope
,
that
this
be
partly
put
on
to
intimidate
my
lady
,
I
believe
I
could
not
have
bear
it
:
<EOS>
but
it
be
grievous
to
me
;
for
I
see
he
be
most
sincerely
in
a
passion
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
,
say
she
,
he
would
be
angry
at
you
,
as
well
as
me
;
for
well
do
I
know
his
unreasonable
violence
,
when
he
be
move
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
word
,
sir
,
say
she
;
<EOS>
Pardon
Pamela
,
if
you
will
not
me
;
for
she
have
commit
no
offence
,
but
that
of
good
-
nature
to
me
,
and
at
my
request
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
go
myself
,
directly
as
I
be
about
to
do
,
have
you
not
prevent
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
prevent
you
,
say
he
,
through
love
;
but
you
have
string
me
for
it
,
through
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
for
my
Pamela
,
I
know
,
besides
the
present
moment
,
I
can
not
be
angry
with
her
;
and
therefore
I
desire
her
never
to
see
me
,
on
such
occasion
,
till
I
can
see
her
in
the
temper
I
ought
to
be
in
,
when
so
much
sweetness
approach
me
.
 
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
therefore
I
say
,
my
dear
,
leave
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
say
I
,
must
I
leave
you
,
and
let
you
go
to
Bedfordshire
without
me
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
sir
,
how
can
I
?
 
<EOS>
say
my
lady
<EOS>
,
You
may
go
to
-
morrow
,
both
of
you
,
as
you
have
design
;
and
I
will
go
away
this
afternoon
:
<EOS>
and
,
since
I
can
not
be
forgive
,
will
try
to
forget
I
have
a
brother
.
  
<EOS>
May
I
,
sir
,
say
I
,
beg
all
your
anger
on
myself
,
and
to
be
reconcile
to
your
good
sister
?
 
<EOS>
Presuming
Pamela
!
<EOS>
reply
he
,
and
make
me
start
;
<EOS>
art
thou
then
<EOS>
so
hardy
,
so
well
able
to
sustain
a
displeasure
,
which
of
all
thing
,
I
expect
from
thy
affection
,
and
thy
tenderness
,
thou
would'st
have
wish
to
avoid
?
 
<EOS>
now
,
say
he
,
and
take
my
hand
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
toss
it
from
him
,
begone
from
my
presence
,
and
reflect
upon
what
you
have
say
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
frightened
,
<EOS>
(
for
then
I
see
he
take
amiss
what
I
say
,
)
that
I
take
hold
of
his
knee
,
as
he
be
turn
from
me
;
and
I
say
,
forgive
me
,
good
sir
!
<EOS>
you
see
I
be
not
so
hardy
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
your
displeasure
!
<EOS>
and
be
ready
to
sink
.
  
<EOS>
His
sister
say
,
only
forgive
Pamela
;
'
tis
all
I
ask
 
You
will
break
her
spirit
quite
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
carry
your
passion
as
much
too
far
as
I
have
do
!
  
<EOS>
I
 
nee
not
say
,
say
he
,
<EOS>
how
well
I
love
her
;
but
she
must
not
intrude
upon
me
at
such
time
as
these
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
intend
,
as
soon
as
I
could
have
quell
,
by
my
reason
,
the
tumult
you
have
cause
by
your
violence
,
to
have
come
in
,
and
take
such
a
leave
of
you
both
,
as
may
become
a
husband
,
and
a
brother
:
<EOS>
but
she
have
,
unbidden
<EOS>
,
break
in
upon
me
,
and
must
take
the
consequence
of
a
passion
,
which
,
when
raise
,
be
as
uncontrollable
as
your
own
.
  
<EOS>
say
she
,
do
I
not
love
you
so
well
,
as
sister
never
love
a
brother
,
I
should
not
have
give
you
all
this
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
and
do
I
not
,
say
he
,
love
you
better
than
you
be
resolve
to
deserve
,
I
should
be
indifferent
to
all
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
last
instance
,
after
the
duel
story
(
which
you
would
not
have
mention
,
have
you
not
know
it
be
always
matter
of
concern
for
me
to
think
upon
)
,
of
poor
Sally
Godfrey
,
be
a
piece
of
spite
and
meanness
,
that
I
can
renounce
you
my
blood
for
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
<EOS>
,
I
be
convince

be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
of
it
myself
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
poor
,
'
twas
mean
,
'
twas
unworthy
of
your
sister
:
<EOS>
and
'
tis
for
this
reason
I
stoop
to
follow
you
,
to
beg
your
pardon
,
and
even
to
procure
one
for
my
advocate
,
who
I
think
have
some
interest
in
you
,
if
I
may
have
believe
your
own
profession
to
her
;
which
now
I
shall
begin
to
think
make
purposely
to
insult
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
care
not
what
you
think
!
 
<EOS>
after
the
meanness
you
have
be
guilty
of
,
I
can
only
look
upon
you
with
pity
:
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
you
have
fall
very
low
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
plain
I
have
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
begone
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
brother
,
let
me
call
you
for
this
once
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
and
Pamela
,
say
her
ladyship
,
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
and
kiss
me
,
and
weep
.
  
<EOS>
I
durst
say
no
more
:
<EOS>
and
my
lady
turn
from
him
,
he
say
,
Your
sex
be
the
d####l
!
<EOS>
how
strangely
can
you
discompose
,
calm
,
and
turn
,
as
you
please
,
us
poor
weathercock
of
man
!
 
<EOS>
Your
last
kind
blessing
to
my
Pamela
I
can
not
stand
!
 
<EOS>
Kiss
but
each
other
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
then

hand
,
and
join
them
;
and
my
lady
salute
me
again
,
with
tear
on
both
side
,
he
put
his
kind
arm
about
each
of
our
waist
,
and
salute
us
with
great
affection
,
say
,
now
,
God
bless
you
both
,
the
two
dear
creature
I
have
in
the
world
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
you
will
quite
forget
my
fault
about
Miss
 
<EOS>
He
stopt
her
before
she
could
speak
the
name
,
and
say
,
for
ever
forget
it
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
Pamela
,
I
will
forgive
you
too
,
if
you
do
not
again
make
my
displeasure
so
light
a
thing
to
you
,
as
you
do
just
now
.
  
<EOS>
say
my
lady
<EOS>
,
She
do
not
make
your
displeasure
a
light
thing
to
her
;
but
the
heavy
it
be
,
the
high
compliment
she
make
me
,
that
she
would
bear
it
all
,
rather
than
not
see
you
and
me
reconcile
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
for
that
,
say
he
:
<EOS>
It
be
either
an
absence
of
thought
,
or
a
slight
by
implication
,
at
least
,
that
my
niceness
could
not
bear
from
her
tenderness
:
<EOS>
for
look
it
not
presume
,
that
she
could
stand
my
displeasure
,
or
be
sure
of
make
her
term
when
she
please
?
 
<EOS>
which
,
fond
as
I
be
of
her
,
I
assure
her
,
will
not
be
always
,
in
wilful
fault
,
in
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
say
my
lady
,
I
can
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
you
have
a
gentleman
here
in
my
brother
;
and
you
may
expect
such
treatment
from
him
,
as
that
character
,
and
his
know
good
sense
and
breeding
,
will
always
oblige
him
to
shew
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
offend
,
the
Lord
have
mercy
upon
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
see
how
it
be
by
poor
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
never
know
him
to
forgive
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
say
I
,
I
will
take
care
as
much
as
I
can
;
for
I
have
be
frighten
out
of
my
wit
,
and
have
offend
,
before
I
know
where
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
so
happily
do
this
storm
blow
over
;
and
my
lady
be
quite
subdue
and
pacify
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
out
of
the
garden
,
his
chariot
be
ready
;
and
he
say
,
well
,
sister
,
I
have
most
assuredly
go
away
towards
my
other
house
,
if
thing
have
not
take
this
happy
turn
;
and
,
if
you
please
,
instead
of
it
,
you
and
I
will
take
an
airing
:
and
pray
,
my
dear
,
say
he
to
me
,
bid
Mrs.
jewke
order
supper
by
eight
o'clock
,
and
we
shall
then
join
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
add
he
,
to
her
nephew
,
will
you
take
your
horse
and
escort
us
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
say
he
:
and
be
glad
,
at
my
soul
,
to
see
you
all
so
good
friend
.
  
<EOS>
so
my
dear
lord
and
master
hand
my
lady
into
his
chariot
,
and
her
kinsman
and
his
servant
ride
after
them
<EOS>
and
I
go
up
to
my
closet
to
ruminate
on
these
thing
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
foolish
thing
that
I
be
,
this
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
run
into
my
head
!
 
<EOS>
how
soon
the
name
and
quality
of
a
wife
give
one
privilege
,
in
one
's
own
account
!
 
<EOS>
yet
,
methink
,
I
want
to
know
more
about
her
;
for
,
be
it
not
strange
,
that
I
,
who
live
year
in
the
family
,
should
have
hear
nothing
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
constantly
with
my
lady
,
that
I
may
the
less
hear
of
it
;
for
she
,
I
dare
say
,
never
know
it
,
or
she
would
have
tell
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
dare
not
ask
him
about
the
poor
lady
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
wonder
what
become
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
whether
she
be
live
?
 
<EOS>
and
whether
any
thing
come
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
full
soon
enough
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
not
to
any
bad
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
other
unhappy
case
,
I
know
it
be
talk
of
,
that
in
his
travel
,
before
I
be
take
into
the
family
long
,
he
have
one
or
two
broil
;
and
,
from
a
youth
,
he
be
always
remarkable
for
courage
,
and
be
reckon
a
great
master
of
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
God
grant
he
may
never
be
put
to
use
it
!
<EOS>
and
that
he
may
be
always
preserve
in
honour
and
safety
!
  
<EOS>
about
seven
o'clock
<EOS>
my
master
send
word
,
that
he
would
have
me
not
expect
him
to
supper
;
for
that
he
,
and
my
lady
his
sister
,
and
nephew
,
be
prevail
upon
to
stay
with
Lady
Jones
;
and
that
Lady
Darnford
,
and
Mr.
Peters
's
family
,
have
promise
to
meet
them
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
they
do
not
send
for
me
;
and
the
rather
,
as
I
hope
those
good
family
be
my
friend
,
would
confirm
my
lady
a
little
in
my
favour
;
and
so
I
follow
my
writing
closely
.
  
<EOS>
about
eleven
o'clock
they
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
but
just
come
down
,
<EOS>
have
tired
myself
with
my
pen
,
and
be
sit
talk
with
Mrs.
Jewkes
and
Mrs.
Worden
,
whom
I
would
,
though
unwillingly
on
their
side
,
make
sit
down
,
which
they
do
over
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Worden
ask
my
pardon
,
in
a
good
deal
of
confusion
,
for
the
part
she
have
act
against
me
;
say
,
that
thing
have
be
very
differently
represent
to
her
;
and
that
she
little
think
I
be
married
,
and
that
she
be
behave
so
rudely
to
the
lady
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
take
nothing
amiss
;
and
very
freely
forgave
her
;
and
hope
my
new
condition
would
not
make
me
forget
how
to
behave
properly
to
every
one
;
but
that
I
must
endeavour
to
act
not
unworthy
of
it
,
for
the
honour
of
the
gentleman
who
have
so
generously
raise
me
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
say
,
that
my
situation
give
me
great
opportunity
of
shew
the
excellence
of
my
nature
,
that
I
could
forgive
offence
against
me
so
readily
,
as
she
,
for
her
own
part
,
must
always
,
she
say
,
acknowledge
,
with
confusion
of
face
.
  
<EOS>
People
,
say
I
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
do
not
know
how
they
shall
act
,
when
their
will
be
in
the
power
of
their
superior
;
and
I
always
think
one
should
distinguish
between
act
of
malice
,
and
of
implicit
obedience
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
person
should
know
how
to
judge
between
lawful
and
unlawful
.
 
<EOS>
and
even
the
great
,
though
at
present
angry
<EOS>
they
be
not
obey
,
will
afterwards
have
no
ill
opinion
of
a
person
for
withstand
them
in
their
unlawful
command
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
seem
a
little
concerned
at
this
;
and
I
say
,
I
speak
chiefly
from
my
own
experience
:
for
that
I
may
say
,
as
they
both
know
my
story
,
that
I
have
not
want
both
for
menace
and
temptation
;
and
have
I
comply
with
the
one
,
or
be
intimidate
by
the
other
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
be
what
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
ah
,
madam
!
<EOS>
reply
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
I
never
know
any
body
like
you
;
and
I
think
your
temper
sweeter
,
since
the
happy
day
,
than
before
;
and
that
,
if
possible
,
you
take
less
upon
you
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
a
good
reason
,
say
I
,
may
be
assign
for
that
:
I
think
myself
in
danger
:
<EOS>
I
look
upon
every
one
as
my
enemy
;
and
it
be
impossible
that
I
should
not
be
fretful
,
uneasy
,
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
my
dear
friend
have
take
from
me
the
ground
of
my
uneasiness
,
and
make
me
quite
happy
,
I
should
have
be
very
blamable
,
if
I
have
not
shew
a
satisfied
and
easy
mind
,
and
a
temper
that
should
engage
every
one
's
respect
and
love
at
the
same
time
,
if
possible
:
<EOS>
and
so
much
the
more
,
as
it
be
but
justify
,
in
some
sort
,
the
honour
I
have
receive
:
for
the
few
enemy
I
make
myself
,
the
more
I
engage
every
one
to
think
,
that
my
good
benefactor
have
be
less
to
blame
in
descend
as
he
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
this
way
of
talk
please
them
both
very
much
;
and
they
make
me
many
compliment
upon
it
,
and
wish
me
always
to
be
happy
,
as
,
they
say
,
I
so
well
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
thus
engage
,
when
my
master
,
and
his
sister
and
her
nephew
,
come
in
:
and
they
make
me
quite
alive
,
in
the
happy
humour
in
which
they
all
return
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
woman
would
have
withdraw
:
but
my
master
say
,
do
not
go
,
Mrs.
Worden
:
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
pray
stay
;
I
shall
speak
to
you
presently
.
<EOS>
so
he
come
to
me
,
and
,
salute
me
,
say
,
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
love
,
I
hope
I
have
not
trespass
upon
your
patience
,
by
an
absence
longer
than
we
design
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
have
not
be
to
your
disadvantage
;
for
though
we
have
not
your
company
,
we
have
talk
of
nobody
else
but
you
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
come
up
to
me
,
and
say
,
ay
,
child
,
you
have
be
all
our
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
:
but
you
have
make
two
or
three
good
family
,
in
this
neighbourhood
,
as
much
your
admirer
,
as
your
friend
here
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
,
say
he
,
have
be
hear
your
praise
,
Pamela
,
from
half
a
score
mouth
,
with
more
pleasure
than
her
heart
will
easily
let
her
express
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
Lady
Davers
's
favour
,
say
I
,
and
the
continuance
of
yours
,
sir
,
would
give
me
more
pride
than
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
child
,
say
she
,
proud
heart
do
not
come
down
all
at
once
;
though
my
brother
,
here
,
have
this
day
set
mine
a
good
many
peg
lower
than
I
ever
know
it
:
<EOS>
but
I
will
say
,
I
wish
you
joy
with
my
brother
;
and
so
kiss
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
lady
,
say
I
,
you
for
ever
oblige
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
now
believe
myself
quite
happy
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
all
I
want
to
make
me
so
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
I
shall
always
,
through
my
life
,
shew
your
ladyship
,
that
I
have
the
most
grateful
and
respectful
sense
of
your
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
child
,
say
she
,
I
shall
not
give
you
my
company
when
you
make
your
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
let
your
own
merit
make
all
your
Bedfordshire
neighbour
your
friend
,
as
it
have
do
here
,
by
your
Lincolnshire
one
;
and
you
will
have
no
need
of
my
countenance
,
nor
any
body
's
else
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
say
her
nephew
,
'
tis
my
turn
:
I
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
soul
,
madam
;
and
,
by
what
I
have
see
,
and
by
what
I
have
hear
,
"
fore
Gad
,
I
think
you
have
meet
with
no
more
than
you
deserve
;
and
so
all
the
company
say
,
where
we
have
be
:
<EOS>
and
pray
forgive
all
my
nonsense
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
shall
always
,
I
hope
,
respect
as
I
ought
,
so
near
a
relation
of
my
good
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
;
and
I
thank
you
for
your
kind
compliment
.
  
<EOS>
Gad
,
Beck
,
say
he
,
I
believe
you
have
some
forgiveness
too
to
ask
;
for
we
be
all
to
blame
,
to
make
madam
,
here
,
fly
the
pit
,
as
she
do
.
 
<EOS>
little
do
we
think
we
make
her
quit
her
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
always
,
say
my
lady
,
sayest
too
much
,
or
too
little
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Worden
say
,
I
have
be
treat
with
so
much
goodness
and
condescension
since
you
go
,
that
I
have
be
beforehand
,
sir
,
in
ask
pardon
myself
.
  
<EOS>
so
my
lady
sit
down
with
me
half
an
hour
,
and
tell
me
,
that
her
brother
have
carry
her
a
fine
airing
,
and
have
quite
charm
her
with
his
kind
treatment
of
her
;
and
have
much
confirm
her
in
the
good
opinion
she
have
begin
to
entertain
of
my
discreet
and
oblige
behaviour
:
<EOS>
but
,
continue
she
,
when
he
would
make
me
visit
,
without
intend
to
stay
,
my
old
neighbour
,
(
for
,
say
she
,
Lady
Jones
be
near
,
we
visit
her
first
;
and
she
scrape
all
the
rest
of
the
company
together
,
)
<EOS>
they
be
all
so
full
of
your
praise
,
that
I
be
quite
bear
down
;
and
,
truly
,
it
be
Saul
among
the
prophet
!
  
<EOS>
You
may
believe
how
much
I
be
delighted
with
this
;
and
I
spare
not
my
due
acknowledgment
.
  
<EOS>
when
her
ladyship
take
leave
,
to
go
to
bed
,
she
say
,
Goodnight
to
you
,
heartily
,
and
to
your
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
kiss
you
when
I
come
in
,
out
of
form
;
but
I
now
kiss
you
out
of
more
than
form
,
I
will
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
join
with
me
,
my
dear
parent
,
in
my
joy
for
this
happy
turn
;
the
contrary
of
which
I
so
much
dreaded
,
and
be
the
only
difficulty
I
have
to
labour
with
.
 
<EOS>
this
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
,
I
wonder
what
be
become
of
her
,
poor
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
,
of
his
own
head
,
mention
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
I
be
very
uneasy
,
neither
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
say
,
I
must
be
a
little
saucy
,
if
I
be
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
master
give
me
an
account
,
when
we
go
up
,
of
the
pain
he
have
take
with
his
beloved
sister
,
as
he
himself
style
her
;
and
of
all
the
kind
thing
the
good
family
have
say
in
my
behalf
;
and
that
he
observe
she
be
not
so
much
displeased
with
hear
them
,
as
she
be
at
first
;
when
she
would
not
permit
any
body
to
speak
of
me
as
his
wife
:
and
that
my
health
,
as
his
spouse
,
be
put
;
when
it
come
to
her
,
she
drink
it
;
but
say
,
come
,
brother
<EOS>
,
here
be
your
Pamela
to
you
:
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
know
how
to
stand
this
affair
,
when
the
Countess
 
,
and
the
young
lady
,
come
to
visit
me
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
young
lady
be
the
person
she
be
so
fond
of
promote
a
match
for
,
with
her
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
,
I
know
,
she
say
,
will
rally
me
smartly
upon
it
;
and
you
know
,
brother
,
she
want
neither
wit
nor
satire
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
I
hope
,
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
,
whenever
she
marry
,
will
meet
with
a
well
husband
than
I
should
have
make
her
;
for
,
in
my
conscience
,
I
think
I
should
hardly
have
make
a
tolerable
one
to
any
but
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
they
rally
him
on
the
stateliness
of
his
temper
;
and
say
,
They
see
he
would
make
an
exceed
good
husband
where
he
be
;
but
it
must
be
owing
to
my
meekness
,
more
than
to
his
complaisance
;
for
,
say
Miss
Darnford
,
I
could
see
well
enough
,
when
your
ladyship
detain
her
,
though
he
have
but
hint
his
desire
of
find
her
at
our
house
,
he
be
so
out
of
humour
at
her
suppose
noncompliance
,
that
mine
and
my
sister
's
pity
for
her
be
much
more
engaged
,
than
our
envy
.
  
<EOS>
ay
,
say
my
lady
,
he
be
too
lordly
a
creature
,
by
much
;
and
can
not
bear
disappointment
,
nor
ever
could
.
  
<EOS>
say
he
,
<EOS>
well
,
Lady
Davers
,
you
should
not
,
of
all
person
,
find
fault
with
me
;
for
I
bear
a
great
deal
from
you
,
before
I
be
at
all
angry
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
reply
she
:
but
when
I
have
go
a
little
too
far
,
as
I
own
<EOS>
I
do
,
you
make
me
pay
for
it
severely
enough
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
you
do
,
sauce
-
box
.
<EOS>
and
the
poor
thing
too
,
add
she
,
that
I
take
with
me
for
my
advocate
,
so
low
have
he
bring
me
!
<EOS>
he
treat
her
in
such
a
manner
as
make
my
heart
ache
for
her
:
<EOS>
but
part
be
art
,
I
know
,
to
make
me
think
the
well
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
sister
,
say
he
,
there
be
very
little
of
that
;
for
,
at
that
time
,
I
care
not
what
you
think
,
nor
have
complaisance
enough
to
have
give
a
shilling
for
your
good
or
bad
opinion
of
her
or
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
own
,
I
be
displeased
to
be
break
in
upon
,
after
your
provocation
,
by
either
of
you
<EOS>
and
she
must
learn
that
lesson
,
never
to
come
near
me
,
when
I
be
in
those
humour
;
which
shall
be
as
little
as
possible
<EOS>
:
for
,
after
a
while
,
if
let
alone
,
I
always
come
to
myself
,
and
be
sorry
for
the
violence
of
a
temper
,
so
like
my
dear
sister
be
here
:
<EOS>
and
,
for
this
reason
think
it
be
no
matter
how
few
witness
I
have
of
its
intemperance
,
while
it
last
;
especially
since
every
witness
,
whether
they
merit
it
or
not
,
as
you
see
in
my
Pamela
's
case
,
must
be
a
sufferer
by
it
,
if
,
unsent
for
,
they
come
in
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
repeat
the
same
lesson
to
me
again
,
and
enforce
it
and
own
,
that
he
be
angry
with
me
in
earnest
,
just
then
;
though
more
with
himself
,
afterwards
,
for
be
so
:
but
when
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
you
want
to
transfer
all
my
displeasure
upon
yourself
,
it
be
so
much
brave
me
with
your
merit
,
as
if
I
must
soon
end
my
anger
,
if
place
there
;
or
it
be
make
it
so
light
to
you
,
that
I
be
truly
displeased
:
for
,
continue
he
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
that
you
should
wish
,
on
any
occasion
whatever
,
to
have
me
angry
with
you
,
or
not
to
value
my
displeasure
as
the
heavy
misfortune
that
could
befall
you
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
say
I
,
you
know
,
that
what
I
do
be
to
try
to
reconcile
my
lady
;
and
,
as
she
herself
observe
,
it
be
pay
her
a
high
regard
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
,
reply
he
;
but
never
think
of
make
a
compliment
to
her
,
or
any
body
live
,
at
my
expense
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
she
have
behave
herself
so
intolerably
,
that
I
begin
to
think
you
have
stoop
too
much
,
and
more
than
I
ought
to
permit
my
wife
to
do
;
and
act
of
meanness
be
what
I
can
not
endure
in
any
body
,
but
especially
where
I
love
:
and
as
she
have
be
guilty
of
a
very
signal
one
,
I
have
much
rather
have
renounce
her
at
that
time
,
than
have
be
reconcile
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
always
comport
myself
so
,
as
not
wilfully
to
disoblige
you
for
the
future
;
and
the
rather
do
I
hope
this
,
as
I
be
sure
I
shall
want
only
to
know
your
pleasure
to
obey
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
instance
shew
me
,
that
I
may
much
offend
,
without
design
it
in
the
least
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Pamela
,
reply
he
,
do
not
be
too
serious
<EOS>
:
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
a
very
tyrannical
husband
to
you
:
<EOS>
yet
do
I
not
pretend
to
be
perfect
,
or
to
be
always
govern
by
reason
in
my
first
transport
;
and
I
expect
,
from
your
affection
,
that
you
will
bear
with
me
when
you
find
me
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
ungrateful
spirit
,
and
can
,
when
cool
,
enter
as
impartially
into
myself
as
most
man
;
and
then
I
be
always
kind
and
acknowledge
,
in
proportion
as
I
have
be
out
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
convince
you
,
my
dear
,
continue
he
,
of
your
fault
,
<EOS>
(
I
mean
,
with
regard
to
the
impetuosity
of
my
temper
;
for
there
be
no
fault
in
your
intention
,
that
I
acknowledge
,
)
<EOS>
I
will
observe
only
,
that
you
meet
,
when
you
come
to
me
,
while
I
be
so
out
of
humour
,
a
reception
you
do
not
expect
,
and
a
harsh
word
or
two
that
you
do
not
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
have
you
not
break
in
upon
me
while
my
anger
last
,
but
staid
till
I
have
come
to
you
,
or
send
to
desire
your
company
,
you
would
have
see
none
of
this
;
but
that
affectionate
behaviour
,
which
I
doubt
not
you
will
always
merit
,
and
I
shall
always
take
pleasure
in
express
:
and
in
this
temper
shall
you
always
find
a
proper
influence
over
me
:
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
suppose
,
whenever
I
be
out
of
humour
,
that
,
in
oppose
yourself
to
my
passion
,
you
oppose
a
proper
butt
to
it
;
but
when
you
be
so
good
,
like
the
slender
reed
,
to
bend
to
the
hurricane
,
rather
than
,
like
the
sturdy
oak
,
to
resist
it
<EOS>
,
you
will
always
stand
firm
in
my
kind
opinion
,
while
a
contrary
conduct
would
uproot
you
,
with
all
your
excellency
,
from
my
soul
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
I
will
endeavour
to
conform
myself
,
in
all
thing
,
to
your
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
you
will
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
endeavour
to
make
my
will
as
conformable
to
reason
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
and
let
me
tell
you
,
that
this
belief
of
you
be
one
of
the
inducement
I
have
have
to
marry
at
all
:
for
nobody
be
more
averse
to
this
state
than
myself
;
and
,
now
we
be
upon
this
subject
,
I
will
tell
you
why
I
be
so
averse
.
  
<EOS>
We
people
of
fortune
,
or
such
as
be
bear
to
large
expectation
,
of
both
sex
,
be
generally
educate
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
occasionally
touch
upon
this
,
Pamela
,
several
time
in
your
journal
,
so
justly
,
<EOS>
that
I
need
say
the
less
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
usually
so
headstrong
,
so
violent
in
our
will
,
that
we
very
little
bear
control
.
  
<EOS>
humour
by
our
nurse
,
through
the
fault
of
our
parent
,
we
practise
first
upon
them
;
and
shew
the
gratitude
of
our
disposition
,
in
an
insolence
that
ought
rather
to
be
check
and
restrain
,
than
encourage
.
  
<EOS>
next
,
we
be
to
be
indulge
in
every
thing
at
school
;
and
our
master
and
mistress
be
reward
with
further
grateful
instance
of
our
boisterous
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
our
wise
parent
'
eye
,
all
look
well
,
<EOS>
all
be
forgive
and
excuse
;
and
for
no
other
reason
,
but
because
we
be
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
Our
next
progression
be
,
we
exercise
our
spirit
,
when
bring
home
,
to
the
torment
and
regret
of
our
parent
themselves
,
and
torture
their
heart
by
our
undutiful
and
perverse
behaviour
to
them
,
which
,
however
ungrateful
in
us
,
be
but
the
natural
consequence
of
their
culpable
indulgence
to
us
,
from
infancy
upwards
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
next
,
after
we
have
,
perhaps
,
half
break
their
heart
,
a
wife
be
look
out
for
:
convenience
,
or
birth
,
or
fortune
<EOS>
,
be
the
first
motive
,
affection
the
last
(
if
it
be
at
all
consult
)
:
and
two
people
thus
educate
,
thus
train
up
,
in
a
course
of
unnatural
ingratitude
,
and
who
have
be
headstrong
torment
to
every
one
who
have
have
a
share
in
their
education
,
as
well
as
to
those
to
whom
they
owe
their
being
,
be
bring
together
;
and
what
can
be
expect
,
but
that
they
should
pursue
,
and
carry
on
,
the
same
comfortable
conduct
in
matrimony
,
and
join
most
heartily
to
plague
one
another
?
 
<EOS>
and
,
in
some
measure
,
indeed
,
this
be
right
;
because
hereby
they
revenge
the
cause
of
all
those
who
have
be
aggrieve
and
insult
by
them
,
upon
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
never
be
control
:
the
lady
have
never
be
contradict
.
  
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
it
from
one
whose
new
relation
,
he
think
,
should
oblige
her
to
shew
a
quite
contrary
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
She
think
it
very
barbarous
,
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
be
oppose
in
her
will
,
and
that
by
a
man
from
whom
she
expect
nothing
but
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
so
great
be
the
difference
between
what
they
both
expect
from
one
another
,
and
what
they
both
find
in
each
other
,
that
no
wonder
misunderstanding
happen
;
that
these
ripen
to
quarrel
;
that
act
of
unkindness
pass
,
which
,
even
have
the
first
motive
to
their
union
be
affection
,
as
usually
it
be
not
,
would
have
efface
all
manner
of
tender
impression
on
both
side
.
  
<EOS>
appeal
to
parent
or
guardian
often
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
by
mediation
of
friend
,
a
reconciliation
take
place
,
it
hardly
ever
hold
:
for
why
?
<EOS>
the
fault
be
in
the
mind
of
both
,
and
neither
of
them
will
think
so
;
so
that
the
wound
(
not
permit
to
be
probe
)
<EOS>
be
but
skin
over
,
and
rankle
still
at
the
bottom
,
and
at
last
break
out
with
more
pain
and
anguish
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
separate
bed
be
often
the
consequence
;
perhaps
elopement
:
if
not
,
an
unconquerable
indifference
,
possibly
aversion
.
<EOS>
and
whenever
,
for
appearance
-
sake
,
they
be
oblige
to
be
together
,
every
one
see
,
that
the
yawn
husband
,
and
the
vapourish
wife
,
be
truly
insupportable
to
one
another
;
but
separate
,
have
free
spirit
,
and
can
be
tolerable
company
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
I
would
have
you
think
,
and
I
hope
you
will
have
no
other
reason
,
that
have
I
marry
the
first
lady
in
the
land
,
I
would
not
have
treat
her
well
than
I
will
my
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
wife
be
my
wife
;
and
I
be
the
long
in
resolve
on
the
state
,
because
I
know
its
requisite
,
and
doubt
my
conduct
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
more
nice
than
many
gentleman
;
but
it
be
because
I
have
be
a
close
observer
of
the
behaviour
of
wed
folk
,
and
hardly
ever
have
see
it
to
be
such
as
I
could
like
in
my
own
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
possibly
,
give
you
instance
of
a
more
particular
nature
of
this
,
as
we
be
long
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
may
say
,
better
acquaint
.
  
<EOS>
have
I
marry
with
the
view
of
many
gentleman
,
and
with
such
as
my
good
sister
(
supply
the
place
of
my
father
and
mother
,
)
would
have
recommend
,
I
have
wed
a
fine
lady
,
bring
up
pretty
much
in
my
own
manner
,
and
use
to
have
her
will
in
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
some
gentleman
can
come
into
a
compromise
;
and
,
after
a
few
struggle
,
sit
down
tolerably
contented
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
have
I
marry
a
princess
,
I
could
not
have
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
love
her
exceedingly
well
,
before
I
have
consent
to
knit
the
knot
with
her
,
and
prefer
her
to
all
her
sex
;
for
without
this
,
Pamela
,
indifference
,
if
not
disgust
,
will
arise
in
every
wed
life
,
that
could
not
have
make
me
happy
at
home
;
and
there
be
few
instance
,
I
believe
,
of
man
's
love
better
,
after
matrimony
,
than
of
woman
's
;
the
reason
of
which
'
tis
not
my
present
purpose
to
account
for
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
must
have
be
morally
sure
,
that
she
prefer
me
to
all
man
;
and
,
to
convince
me
of
this
,
she
must
have
lessen
,
not
aggravate
,
my
failing
:
<EOS>
She
must
have
bear
with
my
imperfection
;
she
must
have
watch
and
study
my
temper
;
and
if
ever
she
have
any
point
to
carry
,
any
desire
of
overcoming
,
it
must
have
be
by
sweetness
and
complaisance
;
and
yet
not
such
a
slavish
one
,
as
should
make
her
condescension
seem
to
be
rather
the
effect
of
her
insensibility
,
than
judgment
or
affection
.
  
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
give
cause
for
any
part
of
my
conduct
to
her
to
wear
the
least
aspect
of
compulsion
or
force
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
command
,
on
my
side
,
or
obedience
on
her
,
I
would
have
blot
from
my
vocabulary
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
reason
I
should
have
think
it
my
duty
to
have
desire
nothing
of
her
,
that
be
not
significant
,
reasonable
,
or
just
;
and
that
then
she
should
,
on
her
,
have
shew
no
reluctance
,
uneasiness
,
or
doubt
,
to
oblige
me
,
even
at
half
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
excuse
her
to
let
me
twice
enjoin
the
same
thing
,
while
I
take
so
much
care
to
make
her
compliance
with
me
reasonable
,
and
such
as
should
not
destroy
her
own
free
agency
,
in
point
that
ought
to
be
allow
her
:
<EOS>
and
if
I
be
not
always
right
,
that
yet
she
would
bear
with
me
,
if
she
see
me
set
upon
it
;
and
expostulate
with
me
on
the
right
side
of
compliance
;
for
that
would
shew
me
,
(
suppose
small
point
in
dispute
,
from
which
the
great
quarrel
,
among
friend
,
generally
arise
,
)
that
she
differ
from
me
,
not
for
contradiction
-
sake
,
but
desire
to
convince
me
for
my
own
;
and
that
I
should
,
another
time
,
take
well
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
this
would
be
so
oblige
a
conduct
,
that
I
should
,
in
justice
,
have
double
my
esteem
for
one
,
who
,
to
humour
me
,
could
give
up
her
own
judgment
;
and
I
should
see
she
could
have
no
other
view
in
her
expostulation
,
after
her
compliance
have
pass
,
than
to
rectify
my
motion
for
the
future
;
and
it
would
have
be
impossible
then
,
but
I
must
have
pay
the
great
deference
to
her
opinion
and
advice
in
more
momentous
matter
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
company
she
must
have
shew
,
that
she
have
,
whether
I
deserve
it
altogether
or
not
,
a
high
regard
and
opinion
of
me
;
and
this
the
rather
,
as
such
a
conduct
in
her
would
be
a
reputation
and
security
to
herself
:
for
if
we
rake
attempt
a
married
lady
,
our
first
encouragement
,
exclusive
of
our
own
vanity
,
arise
from
the
indifferent
opinion
,
slight
,
or
contempt
,
she
express
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
expect
,
therefore
,
that
she
should
draw
a
kind
veil
over
my
fault
;
that
such
as
she
could
not
hide
,
she
would
extenuate
;
that
she
would
place
my
well
action
in
an
advantageous
light
,
and
shew
that
I
have
her
good
opinion
,
at
least
,
whatever
libertie
the
world
take
with
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
have
value
my
friend
for
my
sake
;
be
cheerful
and
easy
,
whomsoever
I
have
bring
home
with
me
;
and
,
whatever
fault
she
have
observe
in
me
,
have
never
blame
me
before
company
;
at
least
,
with
such
an
air
of
superiority
,
as
should
have
shew
she
have
a
well
opinion
of
her
own
judgment
,
than
of
mine
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
Pamela
,
this
be
but
a
faint
sketch
of
the
conduct
I
must
have
expect
from
my
wife
,
<EOS>
let
her
quality
have
be
what
it
would
;
or
have
live
with
her
on
bad
term
.
 
<EOS>
Judge
then
,
if
to
me
a
lady
of
the
modish
taste
could
have
be
tolerable
.
  
<EOS>
the
perverseness
and
contradiction
I
have
too
often
see
,
in
some
of
my
visit
,
even
among
people
of
sense
,
as
well
as
condition
,
have
prejudice
me
to
the
married
state
;
and
,
as
I
know
I
could
not
bear
it
,
surely
I
be
in
the
right
to
decline
it
:
<EOS>
and
you
see
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
I
have
not
go
among
this
class
of
people
for
a
wife
;
nor
know
I
,
indeed
,
where
,
in
any
class
,
I
could
have
seek
one
,
or
have
one
suitable
to
my
mind
,
if
not
you
:
<EOS>
for
here
be
my
misfortune
;
I
could
not
have
be
content
to
have
be
but
moderately
happy
in
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
judge
you
,
from
all
this
,
if
I
could
very
well
bear
that
you
should
think
yourself
so
well
secured
of
my
affection
,
that
you
could
take
the
fault
of
other
upon
yourself
;
and
,
by
a
suppose
supererogatory
merit
,
think
your
interposition
sufficient
to
atone
for
the
fault
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
yet
be
I
not
perfect
myself
:
<EOS>
no
,
I
be
greatly
imperfect
.
 
<EOS>
yet
will
I
not
allow
,
that
my
imperfection
shall
excuse
those
of
my
wife
,
or
make
her
think
I
ought
to
bear
fault
in
her
,
that
she
can
rectify
,
because
she
bear
great
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
may
expect
,
that
you
will
bear
with
me
,
and
study
my
temper
,
till
,
and
only
till
,
you
see
I
be
capable
of
return
insult
for
obligation
;
and
till
you
think
,
that
I
shall
be
of
a
gentle
deportment
,
if
I
be
roughly
use
,
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
one
thing
more
I
will
add
,
that
I
should
scorn
myself
,
if
there
be
one
privilege
of
your
sex
,
that
a
princess
may
expect
,
as
my
wife
,
to
be
indulge
in
,
that
I
would
not
allow
to
my
Pamela
;
for
you
be
the
wife
of
my
affection
<EOS>
:
I
never
wish
for
one
before
you
,
nor
ever
do
I
hope
to
have
another
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
sir
,
say
I
,
my
future
conduct
 
<EOS>
pardon
me
,
say
he
,
my
dear
,
for
interrupt
you
;
but
it
be
to
assure
you
,
that
I
be
so
well
convinced
of
your
affectionate
regard
for
me
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
I
may
have
spare
the
great
part
of
what
I
have
say
:
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
it
must
be
very
bad
for
both
of
us
,
if
I
should
have
reason
to
think
it
necessary
to
say
so
much
.
<EOS>
but
one
thing
have
bring
on
another
;
and
I
have
rather
speak
what
my
niceness
have
make
me
observe
in
other
family
,
than
what
I
fear
in
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
therefore
,
let
me
assure
you
,
I
be
thoroughly
satisfied
with
your
conduct
hitherto
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
have
no
occasion
to
repent
it
:
<EOS>
and
you
shall
find
,
though
greatly
imperfect
,
and
passionate
,
on
particular
provocation
,
(
<EOS>
which
yet
I
will
try
to
overcome
,
)
that
you
have
not
a
brutal
or
ungenerous
husband
,
who
be
capable
of
offer
insult
for
condescension
,
or
return
evil
for
good
.
  
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
these
kind
rule
,
and
generous
assurance
:
and
assure
him
,
that
they
have
make
so
much
impression
on
my
mind
,
that
these
,
and
his
most
agreeable
injunction
before
give
me
,
and
such
as
he
should
hereafter
be
pleased
to
give
me
,
should
be
so
many
rule
for
my
future
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
and
I
be
glad
of
the
method
I
have
take
of
make
a
Journal
of
all
that
pass
in
these
first
stage
of
my
happiness
,
because
it
will
sink
the
impression
still
deep
;
and
I
shall
have
recourse
to
them
for
my
well
regulation
,
as
often
as
I
shall
mistrust
my
memory
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
see
:
what
be
the
rule
I
be
to
observe
from
this
awful
lecture
?
<EOS>
why
these
:
  
1
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
must
not
,
when
he
be
in
great
wrath
with
any
body
,
break
in
upon
him
without
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
remember
it
,
I
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
I
think
this
rule
be
almost
peculiar
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
2
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
must
think
his
displeasure
the
heavy
thing
that
can
befall
me
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
shall
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
that
I
must
not
wish
to
incur
it
,
to
save
any
body
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
furth
if
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
4
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
must
never
make
a
compliment
to
any
body
at
his
expense
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
must
not
be
guilty
of
any
act
of
wilful
meanness
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
mean
in
this
;
and
I
will
endeavour
to
observe
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
the
occasion
on
which
he
mention
this
,
explain
it
;
that
I
must
say
nothing
,
though
in
anger
,
that
be
spiteful
or
malicious
;
that
be
disrespectful
or
undutiful
,
and
such
-
like
.
  
<EOS>
6
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
must
bear
with
him
,
even
when
I
find
him
in
the
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
little
hard
,
as
the
case
may
be
!
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
be
live
or
dead
!
  
<EOS>
7
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
must
be
as
flexible
as
the
reed
in
the
fable
,
l
,
by
resist
the
temp
,
like
the
oak
<EOS>
,
I
be
tear
up
by
the
root
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
do
the
good
I
can
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
great
likelihood
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
that
I
should
be
too
perverse
;
yet
sure
,
the
temp
will
not
lay
me
quite
level
with
the
ground
,
neither
.
  
<EOS>
8
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
education
of
young
people
of
condition
be
generally
wrong
.
<EOS>
Memorandum
;
that
if
any
part
of
child
's
education
fall
to
my
lot
,
I
never
indulge
and
humour
them
in
thing
that
they
ought
to
be
restrain
in
.
  
<EOS>
9
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
accustom
them
to
bear
disappointment
and
control
.
  
<EOS>
10
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
suffer
them
not
to
be
too
much
indulge
in
their
infancy
.
  
<EOS>
11
.
 
<EOS>
nor
at

<EOS>
12
.
 
<EOS>
nor
spoil
them
when
they
come
home

<EOS>
13
.
 
<EOS>
for
that
child
generally
extend
their
perverseness
from
the
nurse
to
the
schoolmaster
:
from
the
schoolmaster
to
the
parent
:
  
14
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
in
their
next
step
,
as
a
proper
punishment
for
all
,
make
their
ownselve
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
15
.
 
<EOS>
that
undutiful
and
perverse
child
make
bad
husband
and
wife
:
<EOS>
and
,
collaterally
,
bad
master
and
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
16
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
not
be
subject
to
be
control
early
,
they
can
not
,
when
married
,
bear
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
17
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
fault
lie
deep
,
and
in
the
mind
of
each
other
,
neither
will
mend
it
.
  
<EOS>
18

<EOS>
whence
follow
misunderstanding
,
quarrel
,
appeal
,
ineffectual
reconciliation
,
separation
,
elopement

or
,
at
good

indifference

perhaps

aversion

<EOS>
Memorandum
;
a
good
image
of
unhappy
wedlock
,
in
the
word
YAWNING
husband
,
and
VAPOURISH
WIFE
,
when
together
:
but
separate
,
both
quite
alive
.
  
<EOS>
19
.
 
<EOS>
few
married
person
behave
as
he
like
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
ponder
this
with
awe
and
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
20
.
 
<EOS>
some
gentleman
can
compromise
with
their
wife
,
for
quietness
sake
;
but
he
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
believe
that
be
true
;
I
do
not
desire
he
should
.
  
<EOS>
21
.
 
<EOS>
that
love
before
marriage
be
absolutely
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
22
.
 
<EOS>
that
there
be
few
instance
of
man
's
than
woman
's
love
well
after
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
have
give
his
reason
for
this
!
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
they
would
not
have
be
to
the
advantage
of
his
own
sex
.
  
<EOS>
23
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
woman
give
her
husband
reason
to
think
she
prefer
him
before
all
man
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
to
be
sure
this
should
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
24
.
 
<EOS>
that
if
she
would
overcome
,
it
must
be
by
sweetness
and
complaisance
;
that
is
,
by
yield
,
he
mean
,
no
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
25
.
 
<EOS>
yet
not
such
a
slavish
one
neither
<EOS>
,
as
should
rather
seem
the
effect
of
her
insensibility
,
than
judgment
or
affection
.
  
<EOS>
26
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
word
COMMAND
and
OBEY
shall
be
blot
out
of
the
Vocabulary
.
 
<EOS>
very
good
!
  
<EOS>
27
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
man
should
desire
nothing
of
his
wife
,
but
what
be
significant
,
reasonable
,
just
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
that
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
28
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
that
she
must
not
shew
reluctance
,
uneasiness
,
or
doubt
,
to
oblige
him
;
and
that
too
at
half
a
word
;
and
must
not
be
bid
twice
to
do
one
thing
.
 
<EOS>
but
may
not
there
be
some
occasion
,
where
this
may
be
a
little
dispensed
with
?
 
<EOS>
but
he
say
afterwards
,
indeed
,
  
29
.
 
<EOS>
that
this
must
be
only
while
he
take
care
to
make
her
compliance
reasonable
,
and
consistent
with
her
free
agency
,
in
point
that
ought
to
be
allow
her
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
this
be
pretty
well
,
consider
.
  
<EOS>
30
.
 
<EOS>
that
if
the
husband
be
set
upon
a
wrong
thing
,
she
must
not
dispute
with
him
,
but
do
it
and
,
expostulate
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
good
sir
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
this
!
 
<EOS>
It
look
a
little
hard
,
methink
!
 
<EOS>
this
would
bear
a
smart
debate
,
I
fancy
,
in
a
parliament
of
woman
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
he
say
,
  
31
.
 
<EOS>
supposing
they
be
only
small
point
that
be
in
dispute
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
this
mend
it
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
for
small
point
,
I
think
,
should
not
be
stand
upon
.
  
<EOS>
32
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
great
quarrel
among
friend
(
and
wife
and
husband
be
,
or
should
be
,
friend
)
arise
from
small
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
this
be
very
true
;
for
I
have
like
to
have
have
anger
here
,
when
I
intend
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
33
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
wife
should
not
desire
to
convince
her
husband
for
contradiction
sake
,
but
for
his
OWN
.
 
<EOS>
as
both
will
find
their
account
in
this
,
if
one
do
,
I
believe
'
tis
very
just
.
  
<EOS>
34
.
 
<EOS>
that
in
all
company
a
wife
must
shew
respect
and
love
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
35
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
for
the
sake
of
her
own
reputation
and
security
;
for
,
  
36
.
 
<EOS>
that
rake
can
not
have
a
great
encouragement
to
attempt
a
married
lady
's
virtue
,
than
her
slight
opinion
of
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
this
stand
to
reason
,
and
be
a
fine
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
37
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
wife
should
therefore
draw
a
kind
veil
over
her
husband
's
fault
.
  
<EOS>
38
.
 
<EOS>
that
such
as
she
could
not
conceal
,
she
should
extenuate
.
  
<EOS>
39
.
 
<EOS>
that
his
virtue
<EOS>
she
should
place
in
an
advantageous
light
  
40
.
 
<EOS>
and
shew
the
world
,
that
he
have
her
good
opinion
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
41
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
must
value
his
friend
for
his
sake
.
  
<EOS>
42
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
must
be
cheerful
and
easy
in
her
behaviour
,
to
whomsoever
he
bring
home
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
43
.
 
<EOS>
that
whatever
fault
she
see
in
him
,
she
never
blame
him
before
company
.
  
<EOS>
44
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
with
such
an
air
of
superiority
,
as
if
she
have
a
less
opinion
of
his
judgment
than
her
own

<EOS>
45
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
man
of
nice
observation
can
not
be
content
to
be
only
moderately
happy
in
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
46
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
wife
take
care
<EOS>
how
she
ascribe
supererogatory
merit
to
herself
;
so
as
to
take
the
fault
of
other
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
it
be
well
if
we
can
bear
our
own
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
of
the
same
nature
with
the
third
;
and
touch
upon
me
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
for
this
wholesome
lecture
.
  
<EOS>
47
.
 
<EOS>
that
his
imperfection
must
not
be
a
plea
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
'
tis
<EOS>
no
matter
how
good
the
woman
be
;
but
'
tis
to
be
hope
man
will
allow
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
he
say
,
  
48
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
husband
,
who
expect
all
this
,
be
to
be
incapable
of
return
insult
for
obligation
,
or
evil
for
good
;
and
ought
not
to
abridge
her
of
any
privilege
of
her
sex
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
parent
,
I
think
this
last
rule
crown
the
rest
,
and
make
them
all
very
tolerable
;
and
a
generous
man
,
and
a
man
of
sense
,
can
not
be
too
much
oblige
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
I
have
this
happiness
,
I
shall
be
very
unworthy
,
if
I
do
not
always
so
think
,
and
so
act
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
after
all
,
you
will
see
I
have
not
the
easy
task
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
my
own
intention
,
that
I
shall
not
wilfully
err
;
and
so
fear
the
less
.
  
<EOS>
not
one
hint
do
he
give
,
that
I
durst
lie
hold
of
,
about
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
my
lady
have
not
speak
of
it
:
for
it
have
give
me
a
curiosity
that
be
not
quite
so
pretty
in
me
;
especially
so
early
in
my
nuptial
,
and
in
a
case
so
long
ago
past
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
intimate
too
,
to
his
sister
,
that
he
have
have
other
fault
,
(
of
this
sort
,
I
suppose
,
)
that
have
not
come
to
her
knowledge
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
make
no
doubt
he
have
see
his
error
,
and
will
be
very
good
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
,
and
pray
it
may
be
so
,
for
his
own
dear
sake
!
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
,
the
seventh
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
arise
in
the
morning
,
I
go
to
wait
on
Lady
Davers
,
see
her
door
open
;
and
she
be
in
bed
,
but
awake
,
and
talk
to
her
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
<EOS>
I
hope
I
do
not
disturb
your
ladyship
.
 
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
say
she
;
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
add
she
,
when
do
you
set
out
for
Bedfordshire
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
can
not
tell
,
madam
;
it
be
design
as
to
-
day
,
but
I
have
hear
no
more
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
sit
down
,
say
she
,
on
the
bed
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
by
the
talk
we
have
yesterday
and
<EOS>
last
night
,
you
have
have
but
a
poor
time
of
it
,
Pamela
,
(
I
must
call
you
so
yet
,
say
she
,
)
since
you
be
bring
to
this
house
,
till
within
these
few
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
too
have
give
Beck
such
an
account
,
as
make
me
pity
you
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
madam
,
say
I
,
if
your
ladyship
know
all
,
you
would
pity
me
;
for
never
poor
creature
be
so
hard
put
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
forget
it
all
now
,
and
be
thankful
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
as
far
as
I
can
find
,
'
tis
a
mercy
you
be
here
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sadly
move
with
some
part
of
your
story
and
you
have
really
make
a
noble
defence
,
and
deserve
the
praise
of
all
our
sex
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
God
enable
me
,
madam
,
<EOS>
reply
<EOS>
I.
 
why
,
say
she
,
'
tis
the
more
extraordinary
,
because
I
believe
,
if
the
truth
be
know
,
you
love
the
wretch
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
while
my
trial
last
,
madam
,
say
I
,
I
have
not
a
thought
of
any
thing
,
but
to
preserve
my
innocence
,
much
less
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
tell
me
truly
,
say
she
,
do
you
not
love
him
all
the
time
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
,
madam
,
answer
I
,
a
great
reverence
for
my
master
,
and
think
all
his
good
action
doubly
good
and
for
his
naughty
one
,
though
I
abhor
his
attempt
upon
me
,
<EOS>
yet
I
could
not
hate
him
;
and
always
wish
him
well
;
but
I
do
not
know
that
it
be
love
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
not
the
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
sweet
girl
!
<EOS>
say
she
;
<EOS>
that
be
prettily
say
:
<EOS>
but
when
he
find
he
could
not
gain
his
end
,
and
begin
to
be
sorry
for
your
suffering
,
and
to
admire
your
virtue
,
and
to
profess
honourable
love
to
you
,
what
do
you
think
?
  
<EOS>
think
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
madam
,
I
do
not
know
what
to
think
!
<EOS>
could
neither
hope
nor
believe
so
great
an
honour
would
fall
to
my
lot
,
and
fear
more
from
his
kindness
,
for
some
time
,
than
I
have
do
from
his
unkindness
:
<EOS>
and
,
have
have
a
private
intimation
,
from
a
kind
friend
,
of
a
sham
marriage
,
intend
by
mean
of
a
man
who
be
to
personate
a
minister
,
it
keep
my
mind
in
too
much
suspense
,
to
be
greatly
overjoyed
at
his
kind
declaration
.
  
<EOS>
say
she
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
do
make
two
or
three
attempt
upon
you
in
Bedfordshire
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
madam
,
say
I
;
he
be
very
naughty
,
to
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
he
propose
article
to
you
,
I
understand
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
madam
,
reply
I
;
but
I
abhor
so
much
the
thought
of
be
a
keep
creature
,
that
I
reject
them
with
great
boldness
;
and
be
resolve
to
die
before
I
would
consent
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
afterwards
attempt
you
,
I
think
:
<EOS>
do
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
o
yes
,
madam
,
say
I
,
a
most
sad
attempt
he
make
!
<EOS>
and
I
have
like
to
have
be
lose
;
for
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
not
so
good
as
she
should
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
tell
her
ladyship
that
sad
affair
,
and
how
I
fall
into
fit
;
and
that
they
believe
me
die
,
forbore
.
 
<EOS>
any
attempt
after
this
base
one
?
<EOS>
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
good
<EOS>
as
he
should
have
be
,
return
I
,
once
in
the
garden
,
afterwards
;
but
I
be
so
watchful
,
and
so
ready
to
take
the
alarm
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
say
she
,
do
he
not
threaten
you
,
at
time
,
and
put
on
his
stern
air
,
every
now
and
then
?
 
<EOS>
Threaten
,
madam
,
reply
I
;
yes
,
I
have
enough
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
die
for
fear
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
you
bear
that
?
<EOS>
say
she
:
for
he
be
a
most
daring
and
majestic
mortal
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
none
of
your
puny
heart
,
but
be
as
courageous
as
a
lion
;
and
,
boy
and
man
,
never
fear
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
,
say
she
,
have
a
pretty
good
spirit
;
<EOS>
but
,
when
I
have
make
him
truly
angry
,
I
have
always
be
force
to
make
it
up
with
him
,
as
well
as
I
could
:
for
,
child
,
he
be
not
one
that
be
easily
reconcile
,
I
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
after
he
have
profess
honourable
love
to
you
,
do
he
never
attempt
you
again
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
madam
,
he
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
good
while
struggle
with
himself
,
and
with
his
pride
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
call
it
,
before
he
could
stoop
so
low
;
and
consider
,
and
consider
again
:
and
once
,
upon
my
saying
but
two
or
three
word
,
that
displease
him
,
when
he
be
very
kind
to
me
,
he
turn
me
out
of
door
,
in
a
manner
,
at
an
hour
's
warning
;
for
he
send
me
above
a
day
's
journey
towards
my
father
's
;
and
then
send
a
man
and
horse
,
post
-
haste
,
to
fetch
me
back
again
;
and
have
be
exceedingly
kind
and
gracious
to
me
ever
since
,
and
make
me
happy
.
  
<EOS>
that
send
you
away
,
say
she
,
one
hour
,
and
send
after
you
the
next
,
be
exactly
like
my
brother
;
and
'
tis
<EOS>
well
if
he
do
not
turn
you
off
twice
or
thrice
before
a
year
come
about
,
if
you
vex
him
:
and
he
would
have
do
the
same
by
the
first
lady
in
the
land
,
if
he
have
be
marry
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
yet
have
he
his
virtue
,
as
well
as
his
fault
;
for
he
be
generous
;
nay
,
he
be
noble
in
his
spirit
;
hate
little
dirty
action
:
he
delight
in
do
good
;
but
do
not
pass
over
a
wilful
fault
easily
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
wise
,
prudent
,
sober
,
and
magnanimous
,
and
will
not
tell
a
lie
,
nor
disguise
his
fault
;
but
you
must
not
expect
to
have
him
all
to
yourself
,
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
no
more
harp
upon
this
string
:
<EOS>
You
see
how
he
be
exasperate
at
me
;
and
he
seem
to
be
angry
at
you
too
;
though
something
of
it
be
art
,
I
believe
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
madam
,
say
I
,
he
have
be
please
to
give
me
a
most
noble
lecture
;
and
I
find
he
be
angry
with
me
in
earnest
,
and
that
it
will
not
be
an
easy
task
to
behave
unexceptionably
to
him
:
for
he
be
very
nice
and
delicate
in
his
notion
,
I
perceive
;
but
<EOS>
yet
,
as
your
ladyship
say
,
exceed
generous
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
she
,
I
be
glad
thou
hadst
a
little
bit
of
his
anger
;
else
I
should
have
think
it
art
;
and
I
do
not
love
to
be
treat
with
low
art
,
any
more
than
he
;
and
I
should
have
be
vex
if
he
have
do
it
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
understand
,
child
,
say
she
,
that
you
keep
a
journal
of
all
matter
that
pass
,
and
he
have
several
time
find
mean
to
get
at
it
:
<EOS>
Should
you
care
I
should
see
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
to
your
disadvantage
;
for
I
find
it
have
no
small
weight
with
him
in
your
favour
;
and
I
should
take
great
pleasure
to
read
all
his
stratagem
,
attempt
,
contrivance
,
menace
,
and
offer
to
you
,
on
one
hand
,
and
all
your
pretty
counter
-
plotting
,
which
he
much
praise
;
your
resolute
resistance
,
and
the
noble
stand
you
have
make
to
preserve
your
virtue
;
and
the
step
by
which
his
pride
be
subdue
,
and
his
mind
induce
to
honourable
love
,
till
you
be
make
what
you
now
be
:
<EOS>
for
it
must
be
a
rare
and
uncommon
story
;
and
will
not
only
give
me
great
pleasure
in
reading
,
but
will
entirely
reconcile
me
to
the
step
he
have
take
:
and
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
be
what
I
never
think
to
be
;
for
I
have
go
a
great
way
in
bring
about
a
match
with
him
and
Lady
Betty
;
and
have
say
so
much
of
it
,
that
the
earl
,
her
father
,
approve
of
it
:
and
so
do
the
Duke
of
#
#
#
#
,
 
her
uncle
;
and
Lady
Betty
herself
be
not
averse
:
and
now
I
shall
be
hunt
to
death
about
it
;
and
this
have
make
me
so
outrageous
as
you
have
see
me
upon
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
can
find
,
by
your
writing
,
that
your
virtue
be
but
suitably
reward
,
it
will
be
not
only
a
good
excuse
for
me
,
but
for
him
,
and
make
me
love
you
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
that
I
would
not
do
,
say
I
,
to
oblige
your
ladyship
;
but
my
poor
father
and
mother
(
who
would
rather
have
see
me
bury
quick
in
the
earth
,
than
to
be
seduce
by
the
great
of
prince
)
<EOS>
have
them
in
their
hand
at
present
;
and
your
dear
brother
have
bespeak
them
,
when
they
have
do
read
them
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
give
me
leave
,
I
will
shew
them
to
your
ladyship
,
with
all
my
heart
;
not
doubt
your
generous
allowance
,
as
I
have
have
his
;
though
I
have
treat
him
very
freely
all
the
way
,
while
he
have
naughty
view
;
and
that
your
ladyship
would
consider
them
as
the
naked
sentiment
of
my
heart
,
from
time
to
time
deliver
to
those
,
whose
indulgence
I
be
sure
of
;
and
for
whose
sight
only
they
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
give
me
a
kiss
now
,
say
her
ladyship
,
for
your
cheerful
compliance
:
<EOS>
for
I
make
no
doubt
my
brother
will
consent
<EOS>
I
shall
see
them
,
because
they
must
needs
make
for
your
honour
;
and
I
see
he
love
you
better
than
any
one
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
,
continue
her
ladyship
,
a
mighty
good
character
of
your
parent
,
as
industrious
,
honest
,
sensible
,
good
folk
,
who
know
the
world
;
and
,
as
I
doubt
not
my
brother
's
generosity
,
I
be
glad
they
will
make
no
ill
figure
in
the
world
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Madam
,
say
I
,
they
be
the
honest
,
the
loving
,
and
the
most
conscientious
couple
breathing
.
 
<EOS>
They
once
live
creditably
;
and
bring
up
a
great
family
,
of
which
I
be
the
young
;
but
have
misfortune
,
through
their
do
beyond
their
power
for
two
unhappy
brother
,
who
be
both
dead
,
and
whose
debt
they
stand
bind
for
;
and
so
become
reduced
,
and
,
by
harsh
creditor
,
(
where
most
of
the
debt
be
,
not
of
their
own
contracting
,
)
<EOS>
turn
out
of
all
;
and
have
,
without
success
,
try
to
set
up
a
little
country
-
school
;
(
for
my
father
understand
a
little
of
account
,
and
write
a
pretty
good
hand
;
)
force
to
take
to
hard
labour
;
but
honest
all
the
time
;
contented
;
never
repine
;
and
love
to
one
another
;
and
,
in
the
midst
of
their
poverty
and
disappointment
,
above
all
temptation
;
and
all
their
fear
be
,
that
I
should
be
wicked
,
and
yield
to
temptation
for
the
sake
of
worldly
rich
and
to
God
's
grace
,
and
their
good
lesson
,
and
those
I
imbibe
from
my
dear
good
lady
,
your
ladyship
's
mother
<EOS>
,
it
be
that
I
owe
the
preservation
of
my
innocence
,
  
and
the
happy
station
I
be
exalt
to
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
pleased
to
kiss
me
again
,
and
say
,
there
be
such
a
noble
simplicity
in
thy
story
,
such
an
honest
artlessness
in
thy
mind
,
and
such
a
sweet
humility
in
thy
deportment
,
notwithstanding
thy
present
station
,
that
I
believe
I
shall
be
force
to
love
thee
,
whether
I
will
or
not
:
and
the
sight
of
your
paper
,
I
dare
say
,
will
crown
the
work
;
will
disarm
my
pride
,
banish
my
resentment
on
Lady
Betty
's
account
,
and
justify
my
brother
's
conduct
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
redound
to
your
own
everlasting
honour
,
as
well
as
to
the
credit
of
our
sex
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
my
brother
will
let
me
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
Worden
,
say
my
lady
,
I
can
say
any
thing
before
you
;
and
you
will
take
no
notice
of
our
conversation
;
but
I
see
you
be
much
touch
with
it
:
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
any
thing
pretty
,
more
unaffected
,
sincere
,
free
,
easy
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
never
,
madam
,
answer
she
,
in
my
life
;
and
it
be
a
great
pleasure
to
see
so
happy
a
reconciliation
take
place
,
where
there
be
so
much
merit
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
have
discover
so
much
prudence
in
Mrs.
Worden
,
that
,
as
well
for
that
,
as
for
the
confidence
your
ladyship
place
in
her
,
I
have
make
no
scruple
of
speak
my
mind
freely
before
her
;
and
of
blame
my
dear
master
while
he
be
blameworthy
,
as
well
as
acknowledge
his
transcendent
goodness
to
me
since
;
which
,
I
be
sure
,
exceed
all
I
can
ever
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
not
<EOS>
,
say
my
lady
;
I
hope
you
will
be
very
happy
in
one
another
;
and
I
will
now
rise
,
and
tell
him
my
thought
,
and
ask
him
to
let
me
have
the
reading
of
your
paper
;
for
I
promise
myself
much
pleasure
in
them
;
and
shall
not
grudge
a
journey
and
a
visit
to
you
,
to
the
other
house
,
to
fetch
them
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
favour
,
say
I
,
be
all
I
have
to
wish
for
;
and
if
I
have
that
,
and
the
continuance
of
your
dear
brother
's
goodness
to
me
,
I
shall
be
easy
under
whatever
else
may
happen
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
I
take
my
leave
,
and
withdraw
;
and
she
let
me
hear
her
say
to
Mrs.
Worden
,
'
tis
a
charming
creature
,
Worden
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
which
excel
;
her
person
,
or
her
mind
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
young
a
creature
too
!
 
<EOS>
well
may
my
brother
love
her
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
I
shall
now
be
too
proud
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
once
a
good
mind
to
have
ask
her
ladyship
about
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
;
but
I
think
it
be
better
let
alone
,
since
she
do
not
mention
It
herself
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
it
too
soon
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
though
,
whether
she
be
live
or
dead
.
  
<EOS>
We
breakfast
together
with
great
good
temper
;
and
my
lady
be
very
kind
,
and
,
ask
my
good
master
,
he
give
leave
very
readily
,
she
should
see
all
my
paper
,
when
you
return
them
to
me
;
and
he
say
,
He
be
sure
,
when
she
come
to
read
them
,
she
would
say
,
that
I
have
well
deserve
the
fortune
I
have
meet
with
:
and
would
be
of
opinion
,
that
all
the
kindness
of
his
future
life
would
hardly
be
a
sufficient
reward
for
my
virtue
,
and
make
me
amend
for
my
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
resolve
to
set
out
the
next
morning
to
return
to
her
lord
,
my
master
order
every

and
us
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
night
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
particular
have
pass
at
dinner
or
supper

but
the
most
condescending
goodness

on
my

to
me
;
and
the
high
civility
from
Mr.
Peters

part

before

I

I
prefer
to
every
one

have

and
I
shall
<EOS>

Dear

<EOS>
You

God
have
do
for
me

<EOS>
You

I
be
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
thousand
thousand
thing
to
tell
you
;
and
a
whole
week

<EOS>
We

<EOS>
but
I
charge
you

my

whatever

call
me
before
stranger
,
that
when
we
be
by
ourselves
you
call
me

your
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
for
what
an
ungrateful
creature
should
I
be
,
who
have
receive
so
many
mercy
,
if
I
attribute
them
not
to
the
divine
goodness
,
but
assume
to
myself
insolent
air
upon
them
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
,
more
and
more
thankful
,
as
I
be
more

more
bl

<EOS>
and
more
humble

as
God
,
the
author
of
all
my
happiness
,
shall
more
distinguish
me

<EOS>
We
go

<EOS>

happy
;
for
Robert
,
who
leave
you
,
have
a
pretty
little
fortune
fall

<EOS>
He

yesterday

when
you

<EOS>
ay

say
my
master
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
honest
Robert
;
for
that
be
another
of
your
favourite
,
Pamela
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
high
time
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
should
marry
you
,
be
it
but
to
engage
the
respect
of
all
my
family
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
sir
,
say
I
,
ten
thousand
reason
why
I
should
rejoice
in
your
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
go
to
say
,
say
Mr.
Longman
,
that
all
your
honour
's
old
servant
be
now
happy
,
but

.
 
<EOS>
You

John
Arnold
?
<EOS>

,
indeed
,
say
he

if
you
will
excuse
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
say
I
,
I
have
have
my
prayer
for
poor
John
answer
,
as
favourably
as
I
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
Mr.
Longman
,
to
be
sure
poor
<EOS>
John
have
act
no
very
good
part
,
take
it
altogether
;
but
he
so
much
honour
you
,
sir
,
and
so
much
respected
you
,
madam
,
that
he
would
have
be
glad
to
have
be
obedient
to
both
;
and
so
be
faithful
to
neither
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
the
poor
fellow
's
heart
be
almost
broke
,
and
he
will
not
look
out
for
any
other
place
;
and
say
,
he
must
live
in
your
honour
's
service
,
or
he
must
die
wretched
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis

<EOS>
say

<EOS>
I

:
You
will
now
have
no
more
puzzle
on
that
account

from
the
goodness

<EOS>
I
shall
be
<EOS>
but
too

<EOS>
I
say
the
poor

.
 
<EOS>
God

<EOS>
God

<EOS>
I
now
have

and
I
will
make
the
good

,
to

.
 
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
John
,
say
I
,
your
wage
will
go
on
,
as
if
you
have
not
leave
your

:
<EOS>
May
I
not
say
so
,
sir
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
yes
,
surely
,
my

reply
he
;
and
augment
them
too
,
if
you
find
his
duty
to
you
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
thousand
million
of
thank
,
say
the
poor
man
<EOS>
:
I
be
very
well
satisfied
,
and
desire
no
augmentation
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
withdraw
,
overjoy
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
and
Mr.
Longman
be
highly
pleased
;
for
though
they
be
incense
against
him
for
his
fault
to
me
,
when
matter
look
badly
for
me
,
yet
they
,
and
all
his
fellow
-
servant
,
always
love
John
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Longman
and
Mrs.
Jervis
have
dine
,
they
come
in
again
,
to
know
if
he
have
any
command
;
and
my
dear
master
,
fill
a
glass
of
wine
,
say
,
Longman
,
I
be
go
to
toast
the
happy
and
honest
couple
in
England
,
my
dear
Pamela
's
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
dear
sir
,
say
I.
  
I
think
,
continue
he
,
that
little
kentish
purchase
want
a
manager
;
and
as
it
be
a
little
out
of
your
way
,
Longman
,
I
have
be
purpose
,
if
I
think
Mr.
Andrews
would
accept
it
,
that
he
should
enter
upon
Hodge
's
farm
that
be
,
and
so
manage
for
me
that
whole
little
affair
;
and
we
will
well
stock
the
farm
for
him
,
and
make
it
comfortable
;
and
I
think
,
if
he
will
take
that
trouble
upon
him
,
it
will
be
an
ease
to
you
,
and
a
favour
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Your
honour
,
say
he
,
can
not
do
a
well
thing
;
and
I
have
have
some
inkling
give
me
,
that
you
may
,
if
you
please
,
augment
that
estate
,
by
a
purchase
,
of
equal
amount
,
contiguous
to
it
;
and
as
you
have
so
much
money
to
spare
,
I
can
not
see
your
honour
can
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
let
me
have
the
particular
another
time
,
and
we
will
consider
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
,
add
he
,
you
will
mention
this
to
your
father
,
if
you
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
too
much
money
,
Longman
,
continue
he
,
lie
useless
;
though
,
upon
this
occasion
,
I
shall
not
grudge
lay
out
as
much
in
livery
and
other
thing
,
as
if
I
have
marry
a
lady
of
a
fortune
equal
,
if
possible
,
to
my
Pamela
's
merit
;
and
I
reckon
you
have
a
good
deal
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
he
,
more
than
I
wish
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
mortgage
in
view
<EOS>
,
if
you
do
not
buy
that
kentish
thing
,
that
I
believe
will
answer
very
well
;
and
when
matter
be
riper
,
will
mention
it
to
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
with
me
,
to
Lincolnshire
,
say
my
master
,
upwards
of
six
hundred
guinea
,
and
think
to
have
lay
most
of
them
out
there
:
(
thank
God
,
think
I
,
you
do
not
!
<EOS>
for
he
offer
me
five
hundred
of
them
,
you
know
:
)
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
lay
out
above
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
;
so
two
hundred
<EOS>
I
leave
there
in
my
escritoire
;
because
I
shall
go
again
for
a
fortnight
or
so
,
before
winter
;
and
two
hundred
I
have
bring
with
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
money
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
what
,
in
three
place
here
,
the
account
of
which
be
in
my
pocket
-
book
,
in
my
library
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
make
some
little
present
,
Pamela
,
to
my
servant
there
,
on
our
nuptial
;
and
these
two
hundred
that
I
have
bring
up
,
I
will
put
into
your
disposal
,
that
,
with
some
of
them
,
you
shall
do
here
as
you
do
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
,
good
sir
,
say
I
,
to
be
so
costly
,
and
so
worthless
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
my
dear
,
reply
he
,
say
not
a
word
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Longman
,
why
,
madam
,
with
money
in
stock
,
and
one
thing
or
another
,
his
honour
could
buy
half
the
gentleman
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
want
not
money
,
and
lay
up
every
year
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
would
have
be
pity
but
<EOS>
his
honour
should
have
wed
just
as
he
have
.
 
<EOS>
very
true
,
Longman
,
say
my
master
;
and
,
pull
out
his
purse
,
say
,
tell
out
,
my
dear
,
two
hundred
guinea
,
and
give
me
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
say
he
,
take
them
yourself
,
for
the
purpose
I
mention
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Mr.
Longman
,
do
you
,
before
sunset
,
bring
my
dear
girl
fifty
pound
,
which
be
due
to
her
this
day
,
by
my
promise
;
and
every
three
month
,
from
this
day
,
pay
her
fifty
pound
;
<EOS>
which
will
be
two
hundred
pound
per
annum
;
and
this
be
for
her
to
lay
out
at
her
own
discretion
,
and
without
account
,
in
such
a
way
as
shall
derive
a
blessing
upon
us

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
what
she
should
thank
me

for
I
be
not

<EOS>
I

in

<EOS>
O

<EOS>
say
I
,
what
will
become
of
me
,
to
be
so
poor
in
myself
,
and
so
rich
in
your
bounty
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
shame
to
take
all
that
your
profuse
goodness
would
heap
upon
me
thus
:
<EOS>
but
indeed
it
shall
not
be
without
account
.
 
<EOS>
make
no
word
,
my

say
he
:
be

hitherto

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
I
will
warrant
,
Mr.

,
say
I
,
notwithstanding
you
be
so
willing
to
have
me
take
large
sum
for
nothing
at
all
,
I
should
affront
you
,
if
I
ask
you

a

of
glove
only
,
on
account
of
my
happy
nuptial
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
not
readily
to
know
how
to
answer
;
and
my
master
say
,
if
Longman
refuse
you
,
my
dear

he
may
be
say
to
refuse
your
first
favour

<EOS>
on

;
but
he
insist
upon
it
,
that
he
would
take
but
five
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
must
desire
you
to
oblige
me
,
Mr.

or
<EOS>
I
shall
think
I
have
affront
you
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
if
I
must

say
he
,
<EOS>
I
know
what
I

<EOS>
what
be
that

Mr.

I

,
which
I
hope
will
be
within

twelvemonth
.
  
<EOS>
not
expect
anything
like
this
from
the
old
gentleman
,
I
look
at
my

to
what
I
have
once
know
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
do
the
same
in
the
first
scene
of
my
fear
,
the
once
frightful
summer
-
house
,
I
shall
have
go
through
most
of
my
distressful
scene
with
gratitude
;
but
shall
never
forbear
thank
God
in
my
mind
,
for
his
goodness
to
me
in
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
find
,
have
whisper
him
what
I
have
do
above
,
and
he
see
me
upon
my
knee
,
with
my
back
towards
him
,
unknown
to
me
;
but
softly
put
to
the
door
again
,
as
he
have
open
it
a
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
not
know
he
have
see
me
,
You
have
some
charming
picture
here
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
say
he
,
my
dear
life
,
so
I
have
;
but
none
equal
to
that
which
your
piety
afford
me
;
and
may
the
God
you
delight
to
serve
,
bless
more
and
more
my

<EOS>
Sir

<EOS>
I
hope
,
reply
he
,
after
your
sweet
example
,
I
shall
be
well
and
well
.
  
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
there
ever
be
so
happy
a
creature
as
I
?
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
would
be
very
ungrateful
to
think
with
uneasiness
,
or
any
thing
but
compassion
,
of
poor
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
.
  
<EOS>
He
order
Jonathan
to
let
the
evening
be
pass
merrily
,
but
wisely
,
as
he
say
,
with
what
every
one
like
,
whether
wine
or
October
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
afterwards
to
lead
me
up
stair
,
and
give
me
possession
of
my
lady
's
dressing
-
room
and
cabinet
,
and
her
fine
repeating
-
watch
and
equipage
;
and
,
in
short
,
of
a
complete
set
of
diamond

as
also
of
the
two
pair
of
diamond

Miss
Tomlins
,
a
rich
heiress
,
that
be

for
his
wife
,
when
he
be
just
come
from
his
travel
;
but
which
go
off
,
after
all
be
agree
upon
on
both
the
friend
'
side
,
because
he
approve
not
her
conversation
;
and
she
have
,
as
he
tell
his
mother
,
too
masculine
an
air
;
and
he
never
could
be
bring
to
see
her
but
once
,
though
the
lady
like
him
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
He

Sunday
night
.
  
<EOS>
this
day
,
as
matter
could
not
be
ready
for
our
appearance
at
a
well
place
,
we
staid
at
home
;
and
my
dear
master
employ
himself
a
good
deal
in
his
library
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
be
take
up
pretty
much
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
as
I
ought
to
be
,
in
thankfulness
,
prayer
and
meditation
,
in
my
newly
-
present
closet
<EOS>
and
I
hope
God
will
be
pleased
to
give
a
blessing
to
me
;
for
I
have
the
pleasure
to
think
I
be
not
puff
up
with
this
great
alteration
;
and
yet
be
I
not
want
to
look
upon
all
these
favour
and
blessing
in
the
light
<EOS>
wherein
I
ought
to
receive
them
,
both
at
the
hand
of
Heaven
,
and
my
dear
benefactor
.
  
<EOS>
We
dine
together
with
great
pleasure
;
and
I
have
,
in
every
word
and
action
,
all
the
instance
of
kindness
and
affection
that
the
most
indulged
heart
could
wish
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
return
to
his
closet
again
;
and
at
five
o'clock
would
come
and
take
a
walk
with
me
in
the
garden
:
<EOS>
and
so
retire
as
soon
as
he
have
dine
,
and
I
go
up
to
mine
.
  
<EOS>
about
six
,
he
be
pleased
to
come
up
to
me
,
and
say
,
now
,
my
dear
,
I
will
attend
you
for
a
little
walk
in
the
garden
;
and
I
give
him
my
hand
with
great
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
this
garden
be
much
better
cultivate
than
the
Lincolnshire
one
;
but
that
be
large
,
and
have
noble
walk
in
it
;
and
yet
there
be
a
pretty
canal
in
this
,
and
a
fountain
and
cascade
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
deal
of
sweet
conversation
as
we
walk
;
and
,
after
we
have
take
a
turn
round
,
I
bend
towards
the
little
garden
;
and
when
I
come
near
the
summer
-
house
,
take
the
opportunity
to
slip
from
him
,
and
just
whipt
up
the
step
of
this
once
frightful
place
,
and
kneel
down
,
and
say
,
I
bless
thee
,
o
God
!
<EOS>
for
my
escape
,
and
for
thy
mercy
!
 
<EOS>
o
let
me
always
possess
a
grateful
,
humble
heart
!
<EOS>
and
I
whipt
down
again
and
join
him
;
and
he
hardly
miss
me
.
  
<EOS>
several
of
the
neighbour
gentry
send
their
compliment
to
him
on
his
return
,
but
not
a
word
about
his
marriage
;
particularly
Mr.
Arthur
,
Mr.
Towers
,
Mr.
Brooks
,
and
Mr.
Martin
of
the
Grove
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
deal
of
employment
in
choose
pattern
for
my
new
clothe
.
<EOS>
He
think
nothing
too
good
;
but
I
think
every
thing
I
see
be
;
and
he
be
so
kind
to
pick
out
six
of
the
rich
for
me
to
choose
three
suit
out
of
,
say
,
We
would
furnish
ourselves
with
more
in
town
,
when
we
go
thither
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
white
,
flower
with
silver
most
richly
;
and
he
be
pleased
to
say
,
that
,
as
I
be
a
bride
,
I
should
make
my
appearance
in
that
the
follow
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
shall
have
in
two
or
three
day
,
from
several
place
,
nothing
but
mantua
-
maker
and
tailor
at
work
.
<EOS>
bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
chargeable
and
what
a
worthless
hussy
<EOS>
I
be
to
the
dear
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
but
his
fortune
and
station
require
a
great
deal
of
it
;
and
his
value
for
me
will
not
let
him
do
less
,
than
if
he
have
marry
a
fortune
equal
to
his
own
:
and
then
,
as
he
say
,
it
would
be
a
reflection
upon
him
,
if
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
doubt
it
will
be
,
as
it
be
:
for
either
way
the
world
will
have
something
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
me
also
choose
some
very
fine
lace
,
and
linen
;
and
have
send
a
message
on
purpose
,
with
his
order
,
to
hasten
all
down
,
what
can
be
do
in
town
,
as
the
millinery
matter
,
etc
.
<EOS>
to
be
complete
there
,
and
send
by
particular
messenger
,
as
do
.
 
<EOS>
all
to
be
here
,
and
finish
by
Saturday
afternoon
,
without
fail
.
  
<EOS>
I
send
away
John
this
morning
,
with
some
more
of
my
paper
to
you
,
and
with
the
few
he
will
give
you
separate
.
 
<EOS>
My
desire
be
,
that
you
will
send
me
all
the
paper
you
have
do
with
,
that
I
may
keep
my
word
with
Lady
Davers
;
to
beg
the
continuance
of
your
prayer
and
blessing
;
to
hope
you
will
give
me
your
answer
about
my
dear
benefactor
's
proposal
of
the
kentish
farm
;
to
beg
you
to
buy
,
two
suit
of
clothe
each
;
of
the
fine
cloth
for
you
,
my
dear
father
;
and
of
a
creditable
silk
for
my
dear
mother
;
and
good
linen
,
and
every
thing
answerable
;
and
that
you
will
,
as
my
good
friend
bid
me
say
,
let
us
see
you
here
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
he
will
have
his
chariot
come
for
you
,
when
you
tell
John
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
long
to
see
you
both
,
my
dear
good
parent
,
and
to
share
with
you
my
felicity
!
  
<EOS>
You
will
have
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
the
goodness
to
go
to
all
your
creditor
,
which
be
chiefly
those
of
my
poor
unhappy
brother
,
and
get
an
account
of
all
you
be
bind
for
;
and
every
one
shall
be
pay
to
the
utmost
farthing
,
and
interest
besides
,
though
some
of
them
have
be
very
cruel
and
unrelenting
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
entitle
to
their
own
,
and
shall
be
thankfully
pay
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
think
of
it
,
John
shall
take
my
paper
down
to
this
place
;
that
you
may
have
something
to
amuse
you
,
of
your
dear
child
's
,
instead
of
those
you
part
with
;
and
I
will
continue
write
till
I
be
settle
,
and
you
be
determined
;
and
then
I
shall
apply
myself
to
the
duty
of
the
family
,
in
order
to
become
as
useful
to
my
dear
benefactor
,
as
my
small
ability
will
let
me
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
think
a
couple
of
guinea
will
be
of
use
to
Mrs.
Mumford
,
who
,
I
doubt
,
have
not
much
aforehand
,
pray
give
them
to
her
,
from
me
,
(
and
I
will
return
them
to
you
,
)
as
for
a
pair
of
glove
on
my
nuptial
:
and
look
through
your
poor
acquaintance
and
neighbour
,
and
let
me
have
a
list
of
such
honest
industrious
poor
,
as
may
be
true
object
of
charity
,
and
have
no
other
assistance
;
particularly
such
as
be
blind
,
lame
,
or
sickly
,
with
their
several
case
;
and
also
such
poor
family
and
housekeeper
as
be
reduce
by
misfortune
,
as
our
be
,
and
where
a
great
number
of
child
may
keep
them
from
rise
to
a
state
of
tolerable
comfort
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
choose
as
well
as
I
can
;
for
I
long
to
be
make
a
beginning
,
with
the
kind
quarterly
benevolence
<EOS>
my
dear
good
benefactor
have
bestow
upon
me
for
such
good
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
to
keep
account
of
all
these
matter
,
and
Mr.
Longman
have
already
furnish
me
with
a
vellum
book
of
white
paper
;
some
side
of
which
I
hope
soon
to
fill
with
the
name
of
proper
object
:
<EOS>
and
though
my
dear
master
have
give
me
all
this
without
account
,
yet
shall
he
see
(
but
nobody
else
)
<EOS>
how
I
lie
it
out
,
from
quarter
to
quarter
;
and
I
will
,
if
any
be
leave
,
carry
it
on
,
like
an
accomptant
,
to
the
next
quarter
,
and
strike
a
balance
four
time
a
year
,
and
a
general
balance
at
every
year
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
write
in
it
,
humble
returns
for
DIVINE
mercy
;
and
lock
it
up
safe
in
my
newly
-
present
cabinet
.
  
<EOS>
I
intend
to
let
Lady
daver
see
no
farther
of
my
paper
,
than
to
her
own
angry
letter
to
her
brother
;
for
I
would
not
have
her
see
my
reflection
upon
it
;
and
she
will
know
,
down
to
that
place
,
all
that
be
necessary
for
her
curiosity
,
as
to
my
suffering
,
and
the
stratagem
use
against
me
,
and
the
honest
part
I
have
be
enable
to
act
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
when
she
have
read
them
all
,
she
will
be
quite
reconcile
:
for
she
will
see
it
be
all
God
Almighty
's
doing
;
and
that
a
gentleman
of
his
part
and
knowledge
be
not
to
be
draw
in
by
such
a
poor
young
body
as
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
detain
John
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
tell
you
to
read
this
last
part
first
,
and
while
he
stay
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
with
my
humble
duty
to
you
both
,
and
my
dear
Mr.
B

's
kind
remembrance
,
I
rest
                       
<EOS>
Your
ever

dutiful
and
gratefully
happy
DAUGHTER
.
  
<EOS>
Wednesday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
HONOURED
FATHER
and
MOTHER
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
proceed
with
my
journal
.
  
<EOS>
on
Tuesday
morning
,
my
dear
sir
ride
out
,
and
bring
with
him
to
dinner
,
Mr.
Martin
of
the
Grove
,
and
Mr.
Arthur
,
and
Mr.
Brooks
,
and
one
Mr.
Chambers
;
and
he
stept
up
to
me
,
and
say
he
have
ride
out
too
far
to
return
to
breakfast
;
but
he
have
bring
with
him
some
of
his
old
acquaintance
,
to
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
sorry
for
it
,
Pamela
?
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
his
lesson
,
and
say
no
,
sure
,
sir
;
I
can
not
be
angry
at
any
thing
you
be
pleased
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
You
know
Mr.
Martin
's
character
,
and
have
severely
censure
him
in
one
of
your
letter
,
as
one
of
my
brother
rake
,
and
for
his
three
lying
-
in
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
give
me
the
follow
account
,
how
he
come
to
bring
them
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
"
I
meet
them
all
at
Mr.
Arthur
's
;
and
his
lady
ask
me
,
if
I
be
really
married
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
yes
,
really
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
whom
?
say
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
why
,
reply
I
,
bluntly
,
to
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
tell
what
to
say
to
me
hereupon
,
and
look
one
upon
another
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
see
I
have
spoil
a
jest
,
from
each
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arthur
say
,
You
have
,
indeed
,
sir
,
a
charming
creature
,
as
ever
I
see
;
and
she
have
mighty
good
luck
.
<EOS>
ay
,
say
I
,
and
so
have
I.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
say
the
less
,
<EOS>
because
a
man
never
do
any
thing
of
this
nature
,
that
he
do
not
think
he
ought
,
if
it
be
but
in
policy
,
to
make
the
good
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
say
Mr.
Arthur
,
if
you
have
sin
,
it
be
with
your
eye
open
:
for
you
know
the
world
as
well
as
any
gentleman
of
your
year
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
really
,
gentleman
,
say
I
,
I
should
be
glad
to
please
all
my
friend
;
but
I
can
not
expect
,
till
they
know
my
motive
and
inducement
,
that
it
will
be
so
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
assure
you
,
I
be
exceedingly
pleased

;
and
that

be
most
to
the
purpose

<EOS>
"
  
"
say
Mr.
Brooks
,
I
have
hear
my
wife
praise
your
spouse
that
be
,
so
much
for
person
and
beauty
,
that
I
want
to
see
her
of
all
thing
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
reply
I
,
if
you
will
all
go
and
take
a
dinner
with
me
,
you
shall
see
her
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
Mrs.
Arthur
,
will
you
bear
us
company
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
what
,
I
will
warrant
,
my
wife
will
not
be
able
to
reconcile
you
to
my
mother
's
waiting
-
maid
;
be
not
that
it
?
 
<EOS>
tell
truth
,
Mrs.
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
say
she
,
I
shall
not
be
backward
to
pay
your
spouse
a
visit
,
in
company
of
the
neighbouring
lady
;
but
for
one
single
woman
to
go
,
on
such
a
sudden
motion
too
,
with
so
many
gentleman
,
be
not
right
.
<EOS>
but
that
need
not
hinder
you
,
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
say
he
,
the
rest
send
,
that
they
should
not
dine
at
home
;
and
they
and
Mr.
Chambers
,
a
gentleman
lately
settle
in
these
part
,
one
and
all
come
with
me
:
<EOS>
and
so
,
my
dear
,
conclude
he
,
when
you
make
your
appearance
next
Sunday
,
you
be
sure
of
a
party
in
your
favour
;
for
all
that
see
you
must
esteem
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
to
them
;
and
when
I
come
down
to
dinner
,
he
be
pleased
to
take
me
by
the
hand
,
at
my
entrance
into
the
parlour
,
and
say
,
My
dear
,
I
have
bring
some
of
my
good
neighbour
to
dine
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
You
be
very
good
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
this
gentleman
be
Mr.
Chambers
;
and
so
he
present
every
one
to
me
;
and
they
salute
me
,
and
wish
us
both
joy
.
  
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
say
Mr.
Brooks
,
wish
you
joy
most
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
My
wife
tell
me
a
good
deal
of
the
beauty
of
your
person
;
but
I
do
not
think
we
have
such
a
flower
in
our
country
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
your
lady
be
very
partial
to
me
;
and
you
be
so
polite
a
gentleman
,
that
you
will
not
contradict
your
good
lady
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
assure
you
,
madam
,
return
he
<EOS>
,
you
have
not
hit
the
matter
at
all
;
for
we
contradict
one
another
twice
or
thrice
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
devil
's
in't
<EOS>
if
we
be
not
agree
in
so
clear
a
case
!
  
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Martin
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Brooks
say
<EOS>
very
true
,
madam
,
in
both
respect
;
<EOS>
(
mean
his
wife
's
and
his
own
contradiction
to
one
another
,
as
well
as
in
my
favour
;
)
for
,
add
he
,
they
have
be
marry
some
year
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
not
the
good
opinion
of
this
gentleman
,
nor
his
jest
,
I
say
,
I
be
almost
sorry
,
sir
,
for
the
gentleman
's
jest
upon
himself
and
his
lady
;
but
I
think
it
should
have
relieve
him
from
a
great
jest
,
your
pleasant
confirmation
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
the
reason
you
give
that
it
may
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
be
the
reason
that
may
be
give
that
it
be
not
so
;
to
wit
,
that
they
have
be
marry
some
year
.
  
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Arthur
,
Mr.
Martin
<EOS>
,
I
think
the
lady
have
very
handsomely
reprove
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
,
say
Mr.
Chambers
;
and
it
be
but
a
very
indifferent
compliment
to
a
bride
.
 
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Martin
,
Compliment
or
not
,
gentleman
,
I
have
never
see
a
matrimony
of
any
time
stand
,
that
it
be
not
so
,
little
or
much
:
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
it
will
never
be
so
here
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
say
I
,
if
it
be
,
I
must
be
the
ungratefullest
person
in
the
world
,
because
I
be
the
most
oblige
person
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
notion
,
say
Mr.
Arthur
,
be
so
excellent
,
that
it
give
a
moral
certainty
it
never
can
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
Mr.
Brooks
to
my
dear
master
,
softly
,
You
have
a
most
accomplished
lady
<EOS>
,
I
do
assure
you
,
as
well
in
her
behaviour
and
wit
,
as
in
her
person
,
call
her
what
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
my
dear
friend
,
say
my
master
,
I
must
tell
you
,
as
I
have
say
before
now
,
that
her
person
make
me
her
lover
,
but
her
mind
make
her
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
course
come
in
,
my
dear
sir
lead
me
himself
to
my
place
;
and
set
Mr.
Chambers
,
as
the
great
stranger
,
at
my
right
hand
,
and
Mr.
Brooks
at
my
left
;
and
Mr.
Arthur
be
pleased
to
observe
,
much
to
my
advantage
,
on
the
ease
and
freedom
with
which
I
behave
myself
,
and
help
them
;
and
say
,
he
would
bring
his
lady
to
be
a
witness
,
and
a
learner
both
,
of
my
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
should
be
proud
of
any
honour
Mrs.
Arthur
would
vouchsafe
to
do
me
;
and
if
once
I
could
promise
myself
the
opportunity
of
his
good
lady
's
example
,
and
those
of
the
other
gentleman
present
,
I
should
have
the
great
opinion
of
my
worthiness
to
sit
in
the
place
I
fill
at
present
with
much
insufficiency
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Arthur
drink
to
my
health
and
happiness
,
and
say
,
My
wife
tell
your
spouse
,
madam
,
you
have
very
good
luck
in
such
a
husband
;
but
I
now
see
who
have
the
good
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Brooks
,
come
,
come
,
<EOS>
let
's
make
no
compliment
;
for
the
plain
truth
of
the
matter
be
,
our
good
neighbour
's
generosity
and
judgment
have
meet
with
so
equal
a
match
in
his
lady
's
beauty
and
merit
,
that
I
know
not
which
have
the
good
luck
.
 
<EOS>
but
may
you
be
both
long
happy
together
,
say
I
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
drink
a
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
friend
,
who
always
take
delight
to
have
me
praise
,
seem
much
pleased
with
our
conversation
;
and
he
say
the
kind
,
tender
,
and
most
respectful
thing
in
the
world
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Insomuch
,
that
the
rough
Mr.
Martin
say
,
do
you
ever
think
our
good
friend
here
,
who
use
to
ridicule
matrimony
so
much
,
would
have
make
so
complaisant
a
husband
?
<EOS>
how
long
do
you
intend
,
sir
,
that
this
shall
hold
?
 
<EOS>
as
long
as
my
good
girl
deserve
it
,
say
he
;
and
that
,
I
hope
,
will
be
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
continue
the
kind
gentleman
,
you
need
not
wonder
I
have
change
my
mind
as
to
wedlock
;
for
I
never
expect
to
meet
with
one
whose
behaviour
and
sweetness
of
temper
be
so
well
adapt
to
make
me
happy
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
and
have
drink
good
health
to
each
of
their
lady
,
I
withdraw
;
and
they
sit
and
drink
two
bottle
of
claret
a
-
piece
,
and
be
very
merry
;
and
go
away
,
full
of
my
praise
,
and
vow
to
bring
their
lady
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
John
have
bring
me
your
kind
letter
,
my
dear
father
,
I
tell
my
good
master
,
after
his
friend
be
go
,
how
gratefully
you
receive
his
generous
intention
as
to
the
kentish
farm
,
and
promise
your
good
endeavour
to
serve
him
in
that
estate
;
and
that
you
hope
your
industry
and
care
would
be
so
well
employ
in
it
,
that
you
should
be
very
little
troublesome
to
him
,
 
as
to
the
liberal
manner
in
which
he
have
intend
to
add
to
a
provision
,
that
of
itself
exceed
all
you
wish
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
well
pleased
with
your
cheerful
acceptance
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
your
engagement
in
the
world
lie
in
so
small
a
compass
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
you
have
get
an
account
of
them
exactly
,
you
will
be
pleased
to
send
it
me
,
with
the
list
of
the
poor
folk
you
be
so
kind
to
promise
to
procure
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
as
my
dear
master
be
so
generous
,
you
should
account
nothing
that
be
plain
,
too
good
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
be
afraid
of
lay
out
upon
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
intend
that
you
shall
not
,
when
you
come
to
us
,
return
to
your
old
abode
;
but
stay
with
us
,
till
you
set
out
for
Kent
;
and
so
you
must
dispose
of
yourself
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
my
dear
father
,
you
have
quite
leave
off
all
slavish
business
.
 
<EOS>
as
farmer
Jones
have
be
kind
to
you
,
as
I
have
hear
you
say
,
pray
,
when
you
take
leave
of
them
,
present
them
with
three
guinea
worth
of
good
book
;
such
as
a
family
bible
,
a
common
prayer
,
a
whole
duty
of
man
,
or
any
other
you
think
will
be
acceptable
;
for
they
live
a
great
way
from
church
;
and
in
winter
the
way
from
their
farm
thither
be
impassable
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
bring
me
my
paper
safe
:
and
I
will
send
them
to
Lady
Davers
the
first
opportunity
,
down
to
the
place
I
mention
in
my
last
.
  
<EOS>
My

Mr.
B

just
now
tell
me
,
that
he
will
carry
me

about
ten
mile
off

in
his
chariot
and
four
,
to
breakfast
at
a
farm
-
house
,
note
for
a
fine
dairy
,
and
where
,
now
and
then
,
the
neighbour
gentry
,
of
both
sex

resort
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
We
set

about
half
an
hour
after
six
,
accordingly
;
and
drive
pretty
smartly
,
get
at
this
truly
neat
house
at
half
an
hour
after
eight
;
and
I
be
much
pleased
with
the
neatness
of
the
good
woman
,
and
her
daughter
and
maid
;
and
he
be
so
good
as
to
say
he
would
now
and
then
take
a
turn
with
me
to
the
same
place
,
and
on
the
same
occasion
,
as
I
seem
to
like
it
;
for
that
it
would
be
a
pretty
exercise
,
and
procure
us
appetite
to
our
breakfast
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
our
return
would
to
our
dinner
.
<EOS>
but
I
find
this
be
not
,
though
a
very
good
reason
,
the
only
one
for
which
he
give
me
this
agreeable
airing
;
as
I
shall
acquaint
you
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
prettily
receive
and
entertain
here
,
and
an
elegancy
run
through
every
thing
,
person
as
well
as
furniture
,
yet
all
plain
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
master
say
to
the
good
housewife
,
<EOS>
do
your
young
boarding
-
school
lady
still
at
time
continue
their
visit
to
you
,
Mrs.
Dobson
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
I
expect
three
or
four
of
them
every
minute
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
within
three
mile
of
this
farm
,
a
very
good
boarding
-
school
for
lady
.
 
<EOS>
the
governess
of
it
keep
a
chaise
and
pair
,
which
be
to
be
make
a
double
chaise
at
pleasure
;
and
in
summer
time
,
when
the
miss
perform
their
task
to
satisfaction
,
she
favour
them
with
an
airing
to
this
place
,
three
or
four
at
a
time
;
and
after
they
have
breakfast
,
they
be
carry
back
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
serve
both
for
a
reward
,
and
for
exercise
;
and
the
miss
who
have
this
favour
be
not
a
little
proud
of
it
;
and
it
bring
them
forward
in
their
respective
task
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
good
method
,
sir
,
say
I.
 
<EOS>
and
just
as
we
be
talk
,
the
chaise
come
in
with
four
miss
,
all
pretty
much
of
a
size
,
and
a

servant
to
attend

<EOS>
They

little
neat
apartment
,
that
go
through
ours
;
and
make
their
honour
very
prettily
,
as
they
pass
by
us
.
<EOS>
I
go
into
the
room
to
them
,
and
ask
them
question
about
their
work
,
and
their
lesson
;
and
what
they
have
do
to
deserve
such
a
fine
airing
and
breakfast
;
and
they
all
answer
me
very
prettily
.
 
<EOS>
and
pray
,
little

,
say
I
,
what
may
I
call
your
name
?
 
<EOS>
one
be
call
Miss
Burdoff
,
one
Miss
Nugent
,
one
Miss
Booth
,
and
the
fourth
Miss
Goodwin
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
which
,
say
I
,
be
the
prettiest
;
but
you
be
all
good
,
my
little
dear
;
and
you
have
a
very
good
governess
,
to
indulge
you
with
such
a
fine
airing
,
and
such
delicate
cream
,
and
bread
and
butter
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
think
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
come
in
,
and
I
have
no
mistrust
in
the
world
;
and
he
kiss
each
of
them
;
but
look
more
wishfully
on
Miss
Goodwin
,
than
on
any
of
the
other
;
but
I
think
nothing
just
then
:
have
she
be
call
Miss
Godfrey
<EOS>
,
I
have
hit
upon
it
in
a
trice
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
go
from
them
,
he
say
,
which
do
you
think
the
prettiest
of
those
miss
?
 
<EOS>
really
,
sir
,
reply
I
,
it
be
hard
to
say
:
Miss
Booth
be
a
pretty
brown
girl
,
and
have
a
fine
eye
;
Miss
Burdoff
have
a
great
deal
of
sweetness
in
her
countenance
,
but
be
not
so
regularly
feature
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nugent
be
very
fair
:
and
Miss
Goodwin
have
a
fine
black
eye
,
and
be
,
besides
,
I
think
,
the
genteel
shaped
child
;
but
they
be
all
pretty
.
  
<EOS>
the
maid
lead
them
into
the
garden
,
to
shew
them
the
beehive
;
and
Miss
Goodwin
make
a
particular
fine
courtesy
to
my
master
;
and
I
say
,
I
believe
miss
know
you
,
sir
;
and
,
take
her
by
the
hand
,
I
say
,
<EOS>
do
you

this
gentleman
,
<EOS>
my
pretty

<EOS>
yes

be
my
own
dear
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
clasp
her
in
my
arm
:
o
why
do
you
not
tell
me
,
sir
,
say
I
,
that
you

a
niece
among
these
little
lady
?
 
<EOS>
and
I
kiss
her
,
and
away
she
tript
after
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
but
pray
,
sir
,
say
I
,
how
can
this
be
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
sister
nor
brother
,
but
Lady
Davers
.
 
<EOS>
how
can
this
be
?
  
<EOS>
He
smile
:
<EOS>
and
then
I
say
,
o
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
tell
me
now
the
truth
,
do
not
this
pretty
miss
stand
in
a
near
relation
to
you
,
than
as
a
niece
?
  
<EOS>
I
 
know
she
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
she
do
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
embrace
him
as
he
stand
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
even
so
,
my
dear
,
reply
he
;
and
you
remember
my
sister
's
good
-
natured
hint
of
Miss
Sally
Godfrey
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
well
,
sir
,
answer
I.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
Miss
Goodwin
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
choose
that
name
for
her
,
say
he
,
because
she
should
not
be
call
by
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
I
,
excuse
me
,
sir
;
I
must
go
and
have
a
little
prattle
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
send
for
her
in
again
,
reply
he
;
and
in
she
come
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
her
in
my
arm
,
and
say
,
o
my
charming
dear
!
<EOS>
will
you
love
me
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
be
your
aunt
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
madam
,
answer
she
,
with
all
my
heart
!
<EOS>
and
I
will
love
you
dearly
:
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
love
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
why
so
?
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
because
,
reply
she
,
you
would
not
speak
to
me
at
first
!
 
<EOS>
and
because
you
would
not
let
me
call
you
uncle
(
for
it
seem
she
be
bid
not
,
that
I
may
not
guess
at
her
presently
)
:
<EOS>
and
yet
,
say
the
pretty
dear
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
see
you
a
great
while
,
so
I
have
not
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Pamela
,
say
he
,
now
can
you
allow
me
to
love
this
little
innocent
?
<EOS>
allow
you
,
sir
,
reply
I
;
you
would
be
very
barbarous
,
if
you
do
not
;
and
I
should
be
more
so
,
if
I
do
not
further
it
all
I
could
,
and
love
the
little
lamb
myself
,
for
your
sake
and
for
her
own
sake
;
and
in
compassion
to
her
poor
mother
,
though
unknown
to
me
:
<EOS>
and
tear
stand
in
my
eye
.
  
<EOS>
say
he
,
why
,
my
love
,
be
your
word
so
kind
,
and
your
countenance
so
sad
?
 
<EOS>
I
draw
to
the
window
from
the
child
;
and
say
,
Sad
it
be
not
,
sir
;
but
I
have
a
strange
grief
and
pleasure
mingle
at
once
in
my
breast
,
on
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
twofold
grief
,
and
a
twofold
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
as
how
,
my
dear
?
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
reply
I
,
I
can
not
help
be
grieve
for
the
poor
mother
of
this
sweet
babe
,
to
think
,
if
she
be
live
,
that
she
must
call
her
chief
delight
her
shame
:
if
she
be
no
more
,
that
she
must
have
have
such
remorse
on
her
poor
mind
,
when
she
come
to
leave
the
world
,
and
her
little
babe
:
<EOS>
and
,
in
the
second
place
,
I
grieve
,
that
it
must
be
think
a
kindness
to
the
dear
little
soul
,
not
to
let
her
know
how
near
the
dear
relation
she
have
in
the
world
be
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
forgive
me
,
dear
sir
,
I
say
not
this
to
reproach
you
,
in
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
a
twofold
cause
of
joy
;
first
,
that
I
have
have
the
grace
to
escape
the
like
unhappiness
with
this
poor
gentlewoman
:
and
next
,
that
this
discovery
have
give
me
an
opportunity
to
shew
the
sincerity
of
my
grateful
affection
for
you
,
sir
,
in
the
love
I
will
always
express
to
this
dear
child
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
I
stept
to
her
again
,
and
kiss
her
;
and
say
,
join
with
me
,
my
pretty
love
,
to
beg
your
dear
uncle
to
let
you
come
and
live
with
your
new
aunt
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
little
precious
,
I
will
love
you
dearly
.
  
<EOS>
Will
you
,
sir
?
say
the
little
charmer
;
will
you
let
me
go
and
live
with
my
aunt
?
  
<EOS>
You
be
very
good
,
my
Pamela
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
not
once
be
deceive
in
the
hope
my
fond
heart
have
entertain
of
your
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
but
will
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
say
I
;
will
you
grant
me
this
favour
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
most
sincerely
love
the
little
charmer
;
and
all
I
be
capable
of
do
for
her
,
both
by
example
and
affection
,
shall
most
cordially
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
add
I
,
oblige
me
in
this
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
already
my
heart
be
set
upon
it
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
sweet
employment
and
companionship
shall
I
have
!
  
<EOS>
We
will
talk
of
this
some
other
time
,
reply
he
;
but
I
must
,
in
prudence
,
put
some
bound
to
your
amiable
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
intend
to
surprise
you
into
this
discovery
;
but
my
sister
lead
the
way
to
it
,
out
of
a
poorness
in
her
spite
,
that
I
could
not
brook
:
<EOS>
and
though
you
have
please
me
beyond
expression
,
in
your
behaviour
on
this
occasion
;
yet
I
can
not
say
,
that
you
have
go
much
beyond
my
expectation
;
for
I
have
such
a
high
opinion
of
you
,
that
I
think
nothing
could
have
shake
it
,
but
a
contrary
conduct
to
this
you
have
express
on
so
tender
a
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
the
dear
little
miss
<EOS>
,
then
you
will
not
let
me
go
home
with
my
aunt
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
will
love
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
you
break
up
next
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
if
you
be
a
good
girl
,
you
shall
pay
your
new
aunt
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
a
low
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
sir
,
answer
she
.
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear
,
say
I
,
and
I
will
get
you
some
fine
thing
against
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
bring
you
some
now
,
have
I
know
I
should
have
see
my
pretty
love
.
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
madam
,
return
she
.
  
<EOS>
how
old
,
sir
,
say
I
,
be
miss
?
 
<EOS>
between
six
and
seven
,
answer
he
.
 
<EOS>
be
she
ever
,
sir
,
say
I
,
at
your
house
?
 
<EOS>
My
sister
,
reply
he
,
carry
her
thither
once
,
as
a
near
relation
of
her
lord
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
sir
,
say
I
,
a
little
miss
;
and
Mrs.
Jervis
and
I
take
her
to
be
a
relation
of
Lord
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
,
return
he
,
know
the
whole
secret
from
the
beginning
;
and
it
make
her
a
great
merit
with
me
,
that
she
keep
it
from
the
knowledge
of
my
father
,
who
be
then
live
,
and
of
my
mother
,
to
her
dying
-
day
;
though
she
descend
so
low
in
her
rage
,
to
hint
the
matter
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
miss
take
their
leave
soon
after
:
and
I
know
not
how
,
but
I
be
strangely
affect
with
this
dear
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
have
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
have
such
a
fine
opportunity
,
oblige
as
I
be
,
to
shew
my
love
for
himself
,
in
my
fondness
for
his
dear
miss
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
come
home
together
in
the
chariot
,
he
give
me
the
follow
particular
of
this
affair
,
additional
to
what
he
have
before
mention
:
  
that
this
lady
be
of
a
good
family
,
and
the
flower
of
it
but
that
her
mother
be
a
person
of
great
art
and
address
,
and
not
altogether
so
nice
in
the
particular
between
himself
and
miss
,
as
she
ought
to
have
be
:
<EOS>
that
,
particularly
,
when
she
have
reason
to
find
him
unsettled
and
wild
,
and
her
daughter
in
more
danger
from
him
,
than
he
be
from
her
,
yet
she
encourage
their
privacy
;
and
even
,
at
last
,
when
she
have
reason
to
apprehend
,
from
their
be
surprise
together
,
in
a
way
not
so
creditable
to
the
lady
,
that
she
be
far
from
forbid
their
private
meeting
;
on
the
contrary
,
that
,
on
a
certain
time
,
she
have
set
one
that
have
formerly
be
her
footman
,
and
a
half
-
pay
officer
,
her
relation
,
to
watch
an
opportunity
,
and
to
frighten
him
into
a
marriage
with
the
lady
:
<EOS>
that
,
accordingly
,
when
they
have
surprise
him
in
her
chamber
,
just
as
he
have
be
let
in
,
they
draw
their
sword
upon
him
,
and
threaten
instantly
to
kill
him
,
if
he
do
not
promise
marriage
on
the
spot
;
and
that
they
have
a
parson
ready
below
stair
,
as
he
find
afterwards
:
<EOS>
that
then
he
suspect
,
from
some
strong
circumstance
,
that
miss
be
in
the
plot
;
which
so
enrage
him
,
with
their
menace
together
,
that
he
draw
,
and
stand
upon
his
defence
;
and
be
so
much
in
earnest
,
that
the
man
he
push
into
the
arm
,
and
disable
;
and
press
pretty
forward
upon
the
other
,
as
he
retreat
,
he
rush
in
upon
him
near
the
top
of
the
stair
,
and
push
him
down
one
pair
,
and
he
be
much
hurt
by
the
fall
:
<EOS>
not
but
that
,
he
say
,
he
may
have
pay
for
his
rashness
;
but
that
the
business
of
his
antagonist
be
rather
to
frighten
than
to
kill
him
:
<EOS>
that
,
upon
this
,
in
the
sight
of
the
old
lady
,
the
parson
she
have
provide
,
and
her
other
daughter
,
he
go
out
of
their
house
,
with
bitter
execration
against
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
that
after
this
,
design
to
break
off
all
correspondence
with
the
whole
family
,
and
miss
too
,
she
find
mean
to
engage
him
to
give
her
a
meeting
at
Woodstock
,
in
order
to
clear
herself
:
<EOS>
that
,
poor
lady
!
<EOS>
she
be
there
oblige
,
naughty
creature
as
he
be
!
<EOS>
to
make
herself
quite
guilty
of
a
bad
fault
,
in
order
to
clear
herself
of
a
lighter
:
that
they
afterwards
meet
at
Godstow
often
,
at
Woodstock
,
and
<EOS>
every
neighbouring
place
to
Oxford
,
where
he
be
then
study
,
as
it
prove
,
guilty
lesson
,
instead
of
improve
one
;
till
,
at
last
,
the
effect
of
their
frequent
interview
grow
too
obvious
to
be
conceal
:
that
the
young
lady
then
,
when
she
be
not
fit
to
be
see
,
for
the
credit
of
the
family
,
be
confine
,
and
all
manner
of
mean
be
use
,
to
induce
him
to
marry
her
:
that
,
find
nothing
would
do
,
they
at
last
resolve
to
complain
to
his
father
and
mother
;
but
that
he
make
his
sister
acquaint
with
the
matter
,
who
then
happen
to
be
at
home
;
and
,
by
her
management
and
spirit
,
their
intention
of
that
sort
be
frustrate
;
and
,
see
no
hope
,
they
agree
to
Lady
Davers
's
proposal
,
and
send
poor
miss
down
to
Marlborough
,
where
,
at
her
expense
,
which
he
answer
to
her
again
,
she
be
provide
for
,
and
privately
lay
-
in
:
that
Lady
Davers
take
upon
herself
the
care
of
the
little
one
,
till
it
come
to
be
fit
to
be
put
to
the
boarding
-
school
,
where
it
now
be
:
and
that
he
have
settle
upon
the
dear
little
miss
such
a
sum
of
money
,
as
the
interest
of
it
would
handsomely
provide
for
her
:
and
the
principal
would
be
a
tolerable
fortune
,
fit
for
a
gentlewoman
,
when
she
come
to
be
marriageable
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
be
the
story
in
brief
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
assure
you
,
Pamela
,
<EOS>
add
he
,
I
be
far
from
make
a
boast
of
,
or
take
a
pride
in
,
this
affair
:
<EOS>
but
since
it
have
happen
,
I
can
not
say
<EOS>
but
I
wish
the
poor
child
to
live
,
and
be
happy
;
and
I
must
endeavour
to
make
her
so
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
to
be
sure
you
should
;
and
I
shall
take
a
very
great
pride
to
contribute
to
the
dear
little
soul
's
felicity
,
if
you
will
permit
me
to
have
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
add
I
,
<EOS>
do
miss
know
any
thing
who
be
her
father
and
mother
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
him
to
say
if
the
poor
lady
be
live
or
dead
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
answer
he
.
 
<EOS>
Her
governess
have
be
tell
,
by
my
sister
,
that
she
be
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
and
his
lady
,
who
be
relate
,
at
a
distance
,
to
Lord
Davers
,
and
now
live
in
Jamaica
;
and
she
call
me
uncle
,
only
because
I
be
the
brother
to
Lady
Davers
,
whom
she
call
aunt
,
and
who
be
very
fond
of
her
:
as
be
also
my
lord
,
who
know
the
whole
matter
;
and
they
have
her
,
at
all
her
little
school
recess
,
at
their
house
,
and
be
very
kind
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
,
add
he
,
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
very
little
know
or
suspect
;
<EOS>
for
,
as
her
mother
be
of
no
mean
family
,
her
friend
endeavour
to
keep
it
secret
,
as
much
as
I
:
and
Lady
Davers
,
till
her
wrath
boil
over
,
t'other
day
,
have
manage
the
matter
very
dexterously
and
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
,
mother
be
of
no
mean
family
,
give
me
not
to
doubt
the
poor
lady
be
live
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
<EOS>
but
how
,
sir
,
can
the
dear
miss
's
poor
mother
be
content
to
deny
herself
the
enjoyment
of
so
sweet
a
child
?
 
<EOS>
ah
,
Pamela
,
reply
he
,
now
you
come
in
;
I
see
you
want
to
know
what
be
become
of
the
poor
mother
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
natural
enough
you
should
;
<EOS>
but
I
be
willing
to
see
how
the
little
suspense
would
operate
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
dear
sir
,
say
I.
  
Nay
,
reply
he
,
'
tis
very
natural
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
have
a
great
deal
of
patience
,
and
be
come
at
this
question
so
fairly
that
you
deserve
to
be
answer
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
then
,
there
be
some
foundation
for
say
,
that
her
mother
,
at
least
,
live
in
Jamaica
;
for
there
she
do
live
,
and
very
happily
too
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
must
observe
,
that
she
suffer
so
much
in
child
-
bed
,
that
nobody
expect
her
life
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
when
she
be
up
,
make
such
an
impression
upon
her
,
that
she
dread
nothing
so
much
as
the
thought
of
return
to
her
former
fault
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
have
intend
to
make
her
a
visit
as
soon
as
her
month
be
well
up
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
unknown
to
me
,
she
engage
herself
to
go
to
Jamaica
,
with
two
young
lady
,
who
be
bear
there
;
and
be
return
to
their
friend
,
after
they
have
be
four
year
in
England
for
their
education
:
and
,
recommend
to
me
,
by
a
very
moving
letter
,
her
little
baby
,
and
that
I
would
not
suffer
it
to
be
call
by
her
name
,
but
Goodwin
,
that
her
shame
may
be
the
less
know
,
for
hers
and
her
family
's
sake
;
she
get
her
friend
to
assign
her
five
hundred
pound
,
in
full
of
all
her
demand
upon
her
family
,
and
go
up
to
London
,
and
embark
,
with
her
companion
,
at
Gravesend
,
and
so
sail
to
Jamaica
;
where
she
be
since
well
and
happily
married
,
pass
to
her
husband
for
a
young
widow
,
with
one
daughter
,
which
her
husband
's
friend
take
care
of
,
and
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
you
see
,
Pamela
,
that
in
the
whole
story
on
both
side
,
the
truth
be
as
much
preserve
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
poor
lady
!
<EOS>
say
I
;
how
her
story
move
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
she
be
so
happy
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
be
you
not
glad
she
be
so
far
off
too
?
 
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
can
not
be
sorry
,
to
be
sure
,
as
she
be
so
happy
;
which
she
could
not
have
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
sir
,
I
doubt
you
would
have
proceed
with
your
temptation
,
if
she
have
not
go
;
and
it
shew
she
be
much
in
earnest
to
be
good
,
that
she
could
leave
her
native
country
,
leave
all
her
relation
,
leave
you
,
whom
she
so
well
love
,
leave
her
dear
baby
,
and
try
a
new
fortune
,
in
a
new
world
,
among
quite
stranger
,
and
hazard
the
sea
;
and
all
to
preserve
herself
from
further
guiltiness
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
indeed
,
sir
,
say
I
,
I
bleed
for
what
her
distress
must
be
,
in
this
case
I
be
grieve
for
her
poor
mind
's
remorse
,
through
her
childbed
terror
,
which
could
have
so
great
and
so
worthy
an
effect
upon
her
afterwards
;
and
I
honour
her
resolution
;
and
would
rank
such
a
return
dear
lady
in
the
class
of
those
who
be
most
virtuous
;
and
doubt
not
God
Almighty
's
mercy
to
her
;
and
that
her
present
happiness
be
the
result
of
his
gracious
providence
,
bless
her
penitence
and
reformation
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
say
I
,
do
you
not
once
see
the
poor
lady
after
her
lying
-
in
?
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
her
so
much
in
earnest
,
answer
he
;
and
I
go
down
to
Marlborough
,
and
hear
she
be
go
from
thence
to
Calne
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
Calne
,
and
hear
she
be
go
to
Reading
,
to
a
relation
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
Thither
I
go
,
and
hear
she
be
go
to
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
I
follow
;
and
there
she
be
;
but
I
could
not
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
at
last
receive
a
letter
from
me
,
beg
a
meeting
with
her
;
for
I
find
her
departure
with
the
lady
be
resolve
on
,
and
that
she
be
with
her
friend
,
only
to
take
leave
of
them
,
and
receive
her
agree
on
portion
:
<EOS>
and
she
appoint
the
Saturday
follow
,
and
that
be
Wednesday
,
to
give
me
a
meeting
at
the
old
place
,
at
Woodstock
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
add
he
,
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
sure
of
her
,
and
doubt
not
I
should
spoil
her
intended
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
out
on
Thursday
to
Gloucester
,
on
a
party
of
pleasure
;
and
on
Saturday
I
go
to
the
place
appoint
,
at
Woodstock
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
thither
,
I
find
a
letter
instead
of
my
lady
;
and
when
I
open
it
,
it
be
to
beg
my
pardon
for
deceive
me
;
express
her
concern
for
her
past
fault
;
her
affection
for
me
;
and
the
apprehension
she
have
,
that
she
should
be
unable
to
keep
her
good
resolve
,
if
she
meet
me
:
that
she
have
set
out
on
the
Thursday
for
her
embarkation
;
for
that
she
fear
nothing
else
could
save
her
;
and
have
appoint
this
meeting
on
Saturday
,
at
the
place
of
her
former
guilt
,
that
I
may
be
suitably
impress
upon
the
occasion
,
and
pity
and
allow
for
her
;
and
that
she
may
get
three
or
four
day
start
of
me
,
and
be
quite
out
of
my
reach
.
 
<EOS>
She
recommend
again
,
as
upon
the
spot
where
the
poor
little
one
owe
its
being
,
my
tenderness
to
it
,
for
her
sake
;
and
that
be
all
she
have
to
request
of
me
,
she
say
;
but
would
not
forget
to
pray
for
me
in
all
her
own
danger
,
and
in
every
difficulty
she
be
go
to
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
I
weep
at
this
move
tale
.
 
<EOS>
and
do
not
this
make
a
deep
impression
upon
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
surely
such
an
affect
lesson
as
this
,
on
the
very
guilty
spot
too
,
(
<EOS>
I
admire
the
dear
lady
's
pious
contrivance
!
)
<EOS>
must
have
have
a
great
effect
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
one
would
have
think
,
sir
,
it
be
enough
to
reclaim
you
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
all
your
naughty
purpose
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
be
quite
change
?
  
<EOS>
why
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
I
be
much
moved
,
you
may
be
sure
,
when
I
come
to
reflect
:
<EOS>
but
,
at
first
,
I
be
so
assured
of
be
a
successful
tempter
,
and
spoil
her
voyage
,
that
I
be
vex
,
and
much
out
of
humour
;
but
when
I
come
to
reflect
,
as
I
say
,
I
be
quite
overcome
with
this
instance
of
her
prudence
,
her
penitence
,
and
her
resolution
;
and
more
admire
her
than
I
ever
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
could
not
bear
<EOS>
she
should
so
escape
me
neither
;
so
much
overcome
me
,
as
it
be
,
in
an
heroical
bravery
;
and
I
hasten
away
,
and
get
a
bill
of
credit
of
Lord
Davers
,
upon
his
banker
in
London
,
for
five
hundred
pound
;
and
set
out
for
that
place
,
have
call
at
Oxford
,
and
get
what
light
I
could
,
as
to
where
I
may
hear
of
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
arrive
in
town
,
which
be
not
till
Monday
morning
,
I
go
to
a
place
call
Crosby
-
square
,
where
the
friend
of
the
two
lady
live
.
<EOS>
She
have
set
out
in
the
flying
-
coach
on
Tuesday
;
get
to
the
two
lady
that
very
night
;
and
,
on
Saturday
,
have
set
out
with
them
for
Gravesend
,
much
about
the
time
I
be
expect
her
at
Woodstock
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
that
I
be
much
affected
,
my
dear
,
with
this
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
get
my
bill
of
credit
convert
into
money
;
and
I
set
out
with
my
servant
on
Monday
afternoon
,
and
reach
gravesend
that
night
;
and
there
I
understand
that
she
and
the
two
lady
have
go
on
board
from
the
very
inn
I
put
up
at
,
in
the
morning
;
and
the
ship
wait
only
for
the
wind
,
which
then
be
turn
about
in
its
favour
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
a
boat
directly
,
and
go
on
board
the
ship
,
and
ask
for
Mrs.
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
but
judge
you
,
my
dear
Pamela
,
her
surprise
and
confusion
,
when
she
see
me
!
 
<EOS>
She
have
like
to
have
faint
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
any
money
to
put
off
the
sailing
till
next
day
,
but
it
would
not
be
comply
with
;
and
fain
would
I
have
get
her
on
shore
,
and
promise
to
attend
her
,
if
she
would
go
over
land
,
to
any
part
of
England
the
ship
would
touch
at
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
immovable
.
  
<EOS>
every
one
conclude
me
her
humble
servant
,
and
be
touch
at
the
moving
interview
;
the
young
lady
,
and
their
female
attendant
,
especially
.
<EOS>
with
great
difficulty
,
upon
my
solemn
assurance
of
honour
,
she
trust
herself
with
me
in
one
of
the
cabin
;
and
there
I
try
,
what
I
could
,
to
prevail
upon
her
to
quit
her
purpose
;
but
all
in
vain
:
<EOS>
She
say
,
I
have
make
her
quite
unhappy
by
this
interview
!
 
<EOS>
She
have
difficulty
enough
upon
her
mind
before
;
but
now
I
have
embitter
all
her
voyage
,
and
give
her
the
deep
distress
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
prevail
upon
her
but
for
one
favour
,
and
that
with
the
great
reluctance
;
which
be
,
to
accept
of
the
five
hundred
pound
,
as
a
present
from
me
;
and
she
promise
,
at
my
earnest
desire
,
to
draw
upon
me
for
a
great
sum
,
as
a
person
that
have
her
effect
in
my
hand
,
when
she
arrive
,
if
she
should
find
it
convenient
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
be
all
the
favour
I
could
procure
;
for
she
would
not
promise
so
much
as
to
correspond
with
me
,
and
be
determine
on
go
:
and
,
I
believe
,
if
I
would
have
marry
her
,
which
yet
I
have
not
in
my
head
,
she
would
not
have
deviate
from
her
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
,
sir
,
say
I
<EOS>
,
do
you
part
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
sail
with
her
,
answer
he
,
and
be
land
at
the
first
port
in
England
or
Ireland
,
I
care
not
which
,
they
should
put
in
at
;
but
she
be
too
full
of
apprehension
to
admit
it
;
and
the
rough
fellow
of
a
master
,
captain
they
call
him
,
(
<EOS>
but
,
in
my
mind
,
I
could
have
throw
him
overboard
,
)
would
not
stay
a
moment
,
the
wind
and
tide
be
quite
fair
;
and
be
very
urgent
with
me
to
go
a
-
shore
,
or
to
go
the
voyage
;
and
be
impetuous
in
my
temper
,
(
spoil
,
you
know
,
my
dear
,
by
my
mother
,
)
and
not
use
to
control
,
I
think
it
very
strange
<EOS>
that
wind
or
tide
,
or
any
thing
else
,
should
be
prefer
to
me
and
my
money
:
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
;
I
be
force
to
go
;
and
so
take
leave
of
the
lady
,
and
the
other
passenger
;
wish
them
a
good
voyage
;
give
five
guinea
among
the
ship
's
crew
,
to
be
good
to
the
lady
,
and
take
such
a
leave
as
you
may
better
imagine
than
I
express
.
 
<EOS>
She
recommend
once
more
to
me
,
the
dear
guest
,
as
she
call
her
,
the
lady
be
present
;
and
thank
me
for
all
these
instance
of
my
regard
,
which
,
she
say
,
would
leave
a
strong
impression
on
her
mind
;
and
,
at
parting
,
she
throw
her
arm
about
my
neck
,
and
we
take
such
a
leave
,
as
affect
every
one
present
,
man
,
as
well
as
lady
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
with
a
truly
heavy
heart
,
I
go
down
the
ship
's
side
to
my
boat
;
and
stand
up
in
it
,
look
at
her
,
as
long
as
I
could
see
her
,
and
she
at
me
,
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eye
;
and
then
I
gaze
at
the
ship
,
till
,
and
after
I
have
land
,
as
long
as
I
could
discern
the
least
appearance
of
it
;
for
she
be
under
sail
,
in
a
manner
,
when
I
leave
her
;
and
so
I
return
highly
disturbed
to
my
inn
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
,
but
rest
not
;
return
to
London
the
next
morning
;
and
set
out
that
afternoon
again
for
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
much
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
for
poor
Sally
Godfrey
.
 
<EOS>
She
send
,
I
understand
,
by
all
opportunity
,
with
the
knowledge
of
her
husband
,
to
learn
how
her
child
,
by
her
first
husband
,
do
;
and
have
the
satisfaction
to
know
she
be
happily
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
about
half
a
year
ago
,
her
spouse
send
a
little
negro
boy
,
of
about
ten
year
old
,
as
a
present
,
to
wait
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
take
ill
of
the
small
-
pox
,
and
die
in
a
month
after
he
be
land
.
  
<EOS>
sure
,
sir
,
say
I
,
your
generous
mind
must
have
be
long
affect
with
this
melancholy
case
,
and
all
its
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
It
hang
upon
me
,
indeed
,
some
time
,
say
he
;
but
I
be
full
of
spirit
and
inconsideration
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
soon
after
to
travel
;
a
hundred
new
object
dance
before
my
eye
,
and
keep
reflection
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
you
see
<EOS>
,
I
have
five
or
six
year
afterwards
,
and
even
before
that
,
so
thoroughly
lose
all
the
impression
you
talk
of
,
that
I
doubt
not
to
make
my
Pamela
change
her
name

<EOS>
o
you
dear
naughty
man
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
this
seem
but
too
true
!
<EOS>
but
I
bless
God
that
it
be
not
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
bless
God
for
your
reformation
,
and
that
for
your
own
dear
sake
,
as
well
as
mine
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
and
I
bless
God
for
it
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
most
sincerely
!
 
<EOS>
and
'
tis
my
great
pleasure
,
because
I
have
<EOS>
,
as
I
hope
,
see
my
error
so
early
;
and
that
with
such
a
stock
of
youth
and
health
on
my
side
,
in
all
appearance
,
I
can
truly
abhor
my
past
liberty
,
and
pity
poor
Sally
Godfrey
,
from
the
same
motive
that
I
admire
my
Pamela
's
virtue
;
and
resolve
to
make
myself
as
worthy
of
them
as
possible
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
hope
,
my
dear
,
your
prayer
for
my
pardon
,
and
my
perseverance
,
will
be
of
no
small
efficacy
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
these
agreeable
reflection
,
on
this
melancholy
but
instructive
story
,
bring
us
in
view
of
his
own
house
;
and
we
alight
,
and
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
till
dinner
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
we
be
so
busy
about
make
ready
for
our
appearance
,
that
I
shall
hardly
have
time
to
write
till
that
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
yesterday
we
set
out
,
attend
by
John
,
Abraham
,
Benjamin
,
and
Isaac
,
in
fine
new
livery
,
in
the
good
chariot
,
which
have
be
new
clean
,
and
line
,
and
new
harness
;
so
that
it
look
like
a
quite
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
arm
to
quarter
with
my
dear
lord
and
master
's
;
though
he
jocularly
,
upon
my
take
notice
of
my
obscurity
,
say
,
that
he
have
a
good
mind
to
have
the
olive
-
branch
,
which
would
allude
to
his
hope
,
quarter
for
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
dress
in
the
suit
I
mention
,
of
white
flower
with
silver
,
and
a
rich
head
-
dress
,
and
the
diamond
necklace
,
ear
-
ring
,
etc
.
<EOS>
I
also
mention
before
:
<EOS>
and
my
dear
sir
,
in
a
fine
laced
silk
waistcoat
,
of
blue
paduasoy
,
and
his
coat
a
pearl
-
colour
fine
cloth
,
with
gold
button
and
button
-
hole
,
and
line
with
white
silk
;
and
he
look
charmingly
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
too
fine
,
and
would
have
lay
aside
some
of
the
jewel
;
but
he
say
,
It
would
be
think
a
slight
to
me
from
him
,
as
his
wife
;
and
though
as
I
apprehend
,
it
may
be
,
that
people
would
talk
as
it
be
,
<EOS>
yet
he
have
rather
they
should
say
any
thing
,
than
that
I
be
not
put
upon
an
equal
footing
,
as
his
wife
,
with
any
lady
he
may
have
marry
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
the
neighbour
gentry
have
expect
us
;
and
there
be
a
great
congregation
;
for
(
against
my
wish
)
we
be
a
little
of
the
late
;
so
that
,
as
we
walk
up
the
church
to
his
seat
,
we
have
abundance
of
gazer
and
whisperer
:
<EOS>
but
my
dear
master
behave
with
so
intrepid
an
air
,
and
be
so
cheerful
and
complaisant
to
me
,
that
he
do
credit
to
his
kind
choice
,
instead
of
shew
as
if
he
be
ashamed
of
it
:
<EOS>
and
as
I
be
resolve
to
busy
my
mind
entirely
with
the
duty
of
the
day
,
my
intentness
on
that
occasion
,
and
my
thankfulness
to
God
,
for
his
unspeakable
mercy
to
me
,
so
take
up
my
thought
,
that
I
be
much
less
concerned
,
than
I
should
otherwise
have
be
,
at
the
gazing
and
whispering
of
the
lady
and
gentleman
,
as
well
as
of
the
rest
of
the
congregation
,
whose
eye
be
all
turn
to
our
seat
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
sermon
be
end
,
we
staid
the
longer
,
because
the
church
should
be
pretty
empty
;
but
we
find
great
number
at
the
church
-
door
,
and
in
the
church
-
porch
;
and
I
have
the
pleasure
of
hear
many
commendation
,
as
well
of
my
person
,
as
my
dress
and
behaviour
,
and
not
one
reflection
,
or
mark
of
disrespect
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
,
who
be
single
,
Mr.
Chambers
,
Mr.
Arthur
,
and
Mr.
Brooks
,
with
their
family
,
be
all
there
:
and
the
four
gentleman
come
up
to
us
,
before
we
go
into
the
chariot
,
and
,
in
a
very
kind
and
respectful
manner
,
compliment
us
both
:
and
Mrs.
Arthur
and
Mrs.
Brooks
be
so
kind
as
to
wish
me
joy
;
and
Mrs.
Brooks
say
,
You
send
Mr.
Brooks
,
madam
,
home
t'other
day
,
quite
charm
with
a
manner
,
which
,
you
have
convince
a
thousand
person
this
day
,
be
natural
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
You
do
me
great
honour
,
madam
,
reply
I.
 
<EOS>
such
a
good
lady
's
approbation
must
make
me
too
sensible
of
my
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
master
hand
me
into
the
chariot
,
and
stand
talk
with
Sir
Thomas
Atkyns
,
at
the
door
of
it
,
(
who
be
make
him
abundance
of
compliment
,
and
be
a
very
ceremonious
gentleman
,
a
little
too
extreme
in
that
way
,
)
and
,
I
believe
,
to
familiarize
me
to
the
gazer
,
which
concern
me
a
little
;
for
I
be
dash
to
hear
the
praise
of
the
countrypeople
,
and
to
see
how
they
crowd
about
the
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
several
poor
people
beg
my
charity
,
and
I
beckon
John
with
my
fan
,
and
say
,
Divide
in
the
further
church
-
porch
,
that
money
to
the
poor
,
and
let
them
come
to
-
morrow
morning
to
me
,
and
I
will
give
them
something
more
,
if
they
do
not
importune
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
give
him
all
the
silver
I
have
,
which
happen
to
be
between
twenty
and
thirty
shilling
;
and
this
draw
away
from
me
their
clamorous
prayer
for
charity
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
come
up
to
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
chariot
,
and
lean
on
the
very
door
,
while
my
master
be
talk
to
Sir
Thomas
,
from
whom
he
could
not
get

;
and
say

by
all
that

,
you
have
charm
the
whole
congregation
!
 
<EOS>
not
a
soul
but
be
full
of
your
praise
!
 
<EOS>
My
neighbour
know
,
well
than
any
body
could
tell
him
,
how
to
choose
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
say
he
,
the
dean
himself
look
more
upon
you
than
his
book
.
  
<EOS>
o
sir
,
say
I
,
you
be
very
encouraging
to
a
weak
mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>

more
than

:
I
would
marry
to

,
if
I

with
a
person
of
<EOS>
but
one
-
half
the
merit
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
,
continue
he
,
and
'
tis
not
my
way
to
praise
too
much
,
an
ornament
to
your
sex
,
an
honour
to
your
spouse
,
and
a
credit
to
religion
.
 
<EOS>
every
body
be
say
so
,
add
he
;
for
you
have
,
by
your
piety
,
edify
the
whole
church
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
have
do
speak
,
the
dean
himself
compliment
me
,
that
the
behaviour
of
so
worthy
a
lady
,
would
be
very
edifying
to
his
congregation
,
and
encouraging
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
I
,
you
be
very
kind
<EOS>
:
I
hope
I
shall
not
behave
unworthy
of
the
good
instruction
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
to
receive
from
so
worthy
a
divine
.
 
<EOS>
He
bow
,
and
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
then
apply
to
me
,
my
master
step
into
the
chariot
,
and
say
,
I
beg
pardon
,

<EOS>
but
I
have
be
say
,
he
be
the
happy
man
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
bow
to
him
,
but
I
could
have
wish
him
further
,
to
make
me
sit
so
in
the
notice
of
every
one
;
which
,
for
all
I
could
do
,
dash
me
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
say
to
my
master
,
if
you
will
come
to
church
every
Sunday
with
your
charming
lady
,
I
will
never

myself
,
and
she
will
give
a
good
example
to
all
the

.
 
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
say
I
to
my
master
,
you

not
how

<EOS>
He

,
by
his
kind

.
  
<EOS>
say
my

My

I
be
very

<EOS>
and
he
say
to

,
We

,
and
to
every
other
place
,
where
we
can
have
the
pleasure
of
see
Mr.
Martin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
say
,
Gad
,
sir

you
be
a
happy
man
;
and
I
think
your
lady
's
example
have
make
you
more
polite
and
handsome
too
,
than
I
ever
know
you
before
,
though
we
never
think
you
unpolite
,
neither
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
bow
,
and
go
to
his
own
chariot
;
and
,
as
we
drive
away
,
the
people
kindly
bless
us
,
and
call
us
a
charming
pair
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
no
other
pride
,
I
hope
,
in
repeat
these
thing
,
than
in
the
countenance
the
general
approbation
give
to
my
dear
master
,
for
his
stooping
so
low
,
you
will
excuse
me
for
it
,
I
know
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
we
go
again
to
church
,
and
a
little
early
,
at
my
request
;
but
the
church
be
quite
full
,
and
soon
after
even
crowd
;
so
much
do
novelty
(
the
more
be
the
pity
!
)
<EOS>
attract
the
eye
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
come
in
after
us
,
and
make
up
to
our
seat
;
and
say
,
if
you
please
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
will
take
my
seat
with
you
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
with
all
my
heart
,
say
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
it
;
but
be
resolve
my
duty
should
not
be
make
second
to
bashfulness
,
or
any
other
consideration
;
and
when
divine
service
begin
,
I
withdraw
to
the
farther
end
of
the
pew
,
and
leave
the
gentleman
in
the
front
,
and
they
behave
quite
suitably
,
both
of
them
,
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
this
the
rather
,
because
Mr.
Martin
be
not
very
noted
for
come
to
church
,
or
attention
when
there
,
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
dean
preach
again
,
which
he
be
not
use
to
do
,
out
of
compliment
to
us
;
and
an
excellent
sermon
he
make
on
the
relative
duty
of
Christianity
:
<EOS>
and
it
take
my
particular
attention
;
for
he
make
many
fine
observation
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Martin
address
himself
twice
or
thrice
to
me
,
during
the
sermon
;
but
he
see
me
so
wholly
engrossed
with
hearken
to
the
good
preacher
,
that
he
forbore
interrupt
me
;
yet
I
take
care
,
accord
to
the
lesson
formerly
give
me
,
to
observe
to
him
a
cheerful
and
oblige
behaviour
,
as
one
of
Mr.
B

friend
and
intimate

<EOS>
My
master
ask
him
to
give
him
his
company
to
supper
;
and
he
say
,
I
be
so
take
with
your
lady
,
that
you
must
not
give
me
too
much
encouragement
;
for
I
shall
be
always
with
you
,
if
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
say
<EOS>
,
You
can
not
favour
us
with
too
much
of
your
company
;
and
as
I
have
leave
you
in
the
lurch
in
your
single
state
,
I
think
you
will
do
well
to
oblige
us
as
much
as
you
can
;
and
who
know
but
my
happiness
may
reform
another
rake
?
 
<EOS>
who
know
?
<EOS>
say
Mr.
Martin
:
<EOS>
why
,
I
know

for
I
be
more

half
reform
already
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
chariot
door

Mrs.
Arthur
,
Mrs.
Brooks

and
Mrs.

be
bring
to
me

by
their
respective
spouse

and
presently
the
witty
Lady

before
,
(
as
I
once
tell
you
,
)
join
them
;
and
Mrs.
Arthur
say
,
she
wish
me
joy
;
and
that
all
the
good
lady
,
my
neighbour
,
would
collect
themselves
together
,
and
make
me
a
visit
.
<EOS>
this
,
say
I
,
will
be
an
honour
,
madam
,
that
I
can
never
enough
acknowledge
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
kind
so
to
countenance
a
person
who
will
always
study
to
deserve
your
favour
,
by
the
most
respectful
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
say
,
My
dear
neighbour
,
you
want
no
countenance
;
your
own
merit
be
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
slight
cold
,
that
keep
me
at
home
in
the
morning
;
but
I
hear
you
so
much
talk
of
,
and
praise
,
that
I
resolve
not
to
stay
away
in
the
afternoon
;
and
I
join
in
the
joy
every
one
give
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
turn
to
my
master
,
and
say
,
You
be
a
sly
thief
,
as
I
always
think
you
.
 
<EOS>
where
have
you
steal
this
lady
?
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
how
barbarous
be
it
,
thus
unawares
,
in
a
manner
,
to
bring
her
here
upon
us
,
to
mortify
and
eclipse
us
all
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
very
kind
,
madam
,
say
he
,
that
you
and
all
my
worthy
neighbour
see
with
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
have
I
not
know
she
have
so
much
excellency
of
mind
and
behaviour
,
as
would
strike
every
body
in
her
favour
at
first
sight
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
dare
to
class
her
with
such
of
my
worthy
neighbour
,
as
now
so
kindly
congratulate
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
I
own
,
say
she
,
<EOS>
softly
,
I
be
one
of
your
censurer
;
but
I
never
like
you
so
well
in
my
life
,
as
for
this
action
<EOS>
,
now
I
see
how
capable
your
bride
be
of
give
distinction
to
any
condition
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
come
to
me
,
My
dear
neighbour
,
say
she

Tuesday
.
  
<EOS>
My
generous
master
have
give
me
,
this
morning
,
a
most
considerate
,
but
yet
,
from
the
nature
of
it
,
melancholy
instance
of
his
great
regard
for
my
unworthiness
,
which
I
never
could
have
wish
,
hope
for
,
or
even
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
a
walk
with
me
,
after
breakfast
,
into
the
garden
;
and
a
little
shower
fall
,
he
lead
me
,
for
shelter
,
into
the
little
summer
-
house
,
in
the
private
garden
,
where
he
formerly
give
me
apprehension
;
and
,
sit
down
by
me
,
he
say
,
I
have
now
finish
all
that
lie
on
my
mind
,
my
dear
,
and
be
very
easy
:
<EOS>
for
have
you
not
wonder
,
that
I
have
so
much
employ
myself
in
my
library
?
 
<EOS>
be
so
much
at
home
,
and
yet
not
in
your
company
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
say
I
;
I
have
never
be
so
impertinent
as
to
wonder
at
any
thing
you
please
to
employ
yourself
about
;
nor
would
give
way
to
a
curiosity
that
should
be
troublesome
to
you
:
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
I
know
your
large
possession
;
and
the
method
you
take
of
look
yourself
into
your
affair
,
must
need
take
up
so
much
of
your
time
,
that
I
ought
to
be
very
careful
how
I
intrude
upon
you
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
say
he
,
but
I
will
tell
you
what
have
be
my
last
work
I
have
take
it
into
my
consideration
,
that
,
at
present
,
my
line
be
almost
extinct
;
and
that
the
chief
part
of
my
maternal
estate
,
in
case
I
die
without
issue
,
will
go
to
another
line
,
and
great
part
of
my
personal
will
fall
into
such
hand
,
as
I
shall
not
care
my
Pamela
<EOS>
should
he
at
the
mercy
of
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
therefore
,
as
human
life
be
uncertain
,
make
such
a
disposition
of
my
affair
,
as
will
make
you
absolutely
independent
and
happy
;
as
will
secure
to
you
the
power
of
do
a
great
deal
of
good
,
and
live
as
a
person
ought
to
do
,
who
be
my
relict
;
and
shall
put
it
out
of
any
body
's
power
to
molest
your
father
and
mother
,
in
the
provision
I
design
them
,
for
the
remainder
of
their
day
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
finish
all
this
very
morning
,
except
to
name
trustee
for
you
;
and
if
you
have
any
body
you
would
confide
in
more
than
another
,
I
would
have
you
speak
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
touch
with
this
mournful
instance
of
his
excessive
goodness
to
me
,
and
<EOS>
the
thought
necessarily
flow
from
the
solemn
occasion
,
that
I
be
unable
to
speak
;
and
at
last
relieve
my
mind
by
a
violent
fit
of
weeping
;
and
could
only
say
,
clasp
my
arm
around
the
dear
generous
man
,
how
shall
I
support
this
!
 
<EOS>
so
very
cruel
,
yet
so
very
kind
!
  
<EOS>
do
not
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
be
concern
at
what
give
me
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
nearer
<EOS>
my
end
,
for
have
make
this
disposition
;
but
I
think
the
putting
off
these
material
point
,
when
so
many
accident
every
day
happen
,
and
life
be
so
precarious
,
be
one
of
the
most
inexcusable
thing
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
many
important
point
to
be
think
of
,
when
life
be
draw
to
its
utmost
verge
;
and
the
mind
may
be
so
agitated
and
unfit
,
that
it
be
a
most
sad
thing
to
put
off
,
to
that
time
,
any
of
those
concern
,
which
more
especially
require
a
considerate
and
compose
frame
of
temper
,
and
perfect
health
and
vigour
,
to
give
direction
about
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
friend
,
Mr.
Carlton
,
who
die
in
my
arm
so
lately
;
and
have
a
mind
disturb
by
worldly
consideration
on
one
side
;
a
weakness
of
body
,
through
the
violence
of
his
distemper
,
on
another
;
and
the
concern
of
still
as
much
more
moment
,
as
the
soul
be
to
the
body
,
on
a
third
;
make
so
great
an
impression
upon
me
then
,
that
I
be
the
more
impatient
to
come
to
this
house
,
where
be
most
of
my
writing
,
in
order
to
make
the
disposition
I
have
now
perfect
:
and
since
it
be
grievous
to
my
dear
girl
,
I
will
myself
think
of
such
trustee
as
shall
be
most
for
her
benefit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
,
therefore
,
to
assure
you
,
my
dear
,
that
in
this
instance
,
as
I
will
do
in
any
other
I
can
think
of
,
I
have
study
to
make
you
quite
easy
,
free
,
and
independent
.
 
<EOS>
and
because
I
shall
avoid
all
occasion
,
for
the
future
,
which
may
discompose
you
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
request
to
make
;
which
be
,
that
if
it
please
God
,
for
my
sin
,
to
separate
me
from
my
dear
Pamela
,
you
will
only
resolve
not
to
marry
one
person
;
for
I
would
not
be
such
a
Herod
,
as
to
restrain
you
from
a
change
of
condition
with
any
other
,
however
reluctantly
I
may
think
of
any
other
person
's
succeed
me
in
your
esteem
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
answer
,
and
think
my
heart
would
have
burst
:
<EOS>
and
he
continue
,
<EOS>
to
conclude
at
once
a
subject
that
be
so
grievous
to
you
,
I
will
tell
you
,
my
Pamela
,
that
this
person
be
Mr.
Williams
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
will
acquaint
you
with
my
motive
for
this
request
;
which
be
wholly
owing
to
my
niceness
,
and
to
no
dislike
I
have
for
him
,
or
apprehension
of
any
likelihood
that
it
will
be
so
:
but
,
methink
it
would
reflect
a
little
upon
my
Pamela
,
if
she
be
to
give
way
to
such
a
conduct
,
as
if
she
have
marry
a
man
for
his
estate
,
when
she
have
rather
have
have
another
,
have
it
not
be
for
that
;
and
that
now
,
the
world
will
say
,
she
be
at
liberty
to
pursue
her
inclination
,
the
parson
be
the
man
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
bear
even
the
most
distant
apprehension
,
that
I
have
not
the
preference
with
you
,
of
any
man
live
,
let
me
have
be
what
I
would
,
as
I
have
shew
my
dear
life
,
that
I
have
prefer
her
to
all
her
sex
,
of
whatever
degree
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
,
may
I
have
have
the
world
;
and
he
take
me
in
his
arm
,
and
say
,
I
have
now
speak
all
my
mind
,
and
expect
no
answer
;
and
I
see
you
too
much
move
to
give
me
one
.
 
<EOS>
only
forgive
me
the
mention
,
since
I
have
tell
you
my
motive
;
which
as
much
affect
your
reputation
,
as
my
niceness
;
and
offer
not
at
an
answer
;
 
<EOS>
only
say
,
you
forgive
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
I
have
not
one
discomposing
thing
to
say
to
my
dear
,
for
the
rest
of
my
life
;
which
I
pray
God
,
for
both
our
sake
,
to
lengthen
for
many
happy
year
.
  
<EOS>
Grief
still
choake
up
the
passage
of
my
word
;
and
he
say
,
the
shower
be
over
,
my
dear
:
<EOS>
let
us
walk
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
lead
me
out
,
and
I
would
have
speak
;
but
he
say
,
I
will
not
hear
my
dear
creature
say
any
thing
!
 
<EOS>
to
hearken
to
your
assurance
of
comply
with
my
request
,
would
look
as
if
I
doubt
you
,
and
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
confident
I
need
only
to
speak
my
mind
,
to
be
observe
by
you
;
and
I
shall
never
more
think
on
the
subject
,
if
you
do
not
remind
me
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
most
sweetly
change
the
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
you
with
pleasure
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
take
in
the
delightful
fragrance
that
this
sweet
shower
have
give
to
these
bank
of
flower
?
<EOS>
Your
presence
be
so
enliven
to
me
,
that
I
could
almost
fancy
,
that
what
we
owe
to
the
shower
,
be
owe
to
that
:
and
all
nature
,
methink
,
bloom
around
me
when
I
have
my
Pamela
by
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
poetess
,
my
dear
;
and
I
will
give
you
a
few
line
,
that
I
make
myself
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
I
be
speak
of
,
the
presence
of
a
sweet
companion
,
and
the
fresh
verdure
,
that
,
after
a
shower
,
succeed
a
long
drought
,
shew
itself
throughout
all
vegetable
nature
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
a
sweet
and
easy
accent
,
(
with
his
dear
arm
about
me
as
we
walk
,
)
he
sing
me
the
follow
verse
;
of
which
he
afterwards
favour
me
with
a
copy
:

thus
sweetly
do

palliate
the
woe

which
the
generosity
of
his
action
,
mix
with
the
solemness
of
the
occasion
,
and
the
strange
request
he
have
vouchsafe
to
make
me

have
occasion

<EOS>
and
all
he
would
permit

to
say

be

that
I
be
not

<EOS>
displease

let
me
thus
testify
my

and
I
take

but
yet
my

God

enjoyment

<EOS>
subject
to
imaginary
evil
,
when
it
have
no
real
one
to
disturb
it
;
and
that
can
be
make
as
effectually
unhappy
by
its
apprehension
of
remote
contingency
,
as
if
it
be
struggle
with
the
pang
of
a
present
distress
!
 
<EOS>
this
,
duly
reflect
upon
,
methinks
,
should
convince
every
one
,
that
this
world
be
not
a
place
for
the
immortal
mind
to
be
confine
to
;
and
that
there
must
be
an
hereafter
,
where
the
whole
soul
shall
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
shall
get
out
of
my
depth
;
my
shallow
mind
can
not
comprehend
,
as
it
ought
,
these
weighty
subject
:
<EOS>
let
me
only
therefore
pray
,
that
,
after
have
make
a
grateful
use
of
God
's
mercy
here
,
I
may
,
with
my
dear
benefactor

rejoice
in
that
happy
state

where
be
no
mixture
,
no
unsatisfiedness
;
and
where
all
be
joy
,
and
peace
,
and
love
,
for
evermore

<EOS>
I
say
,
when
we
sit
at
supper
,
the
charming
taste
you
give
me
,
sir

of
your
poetical
fancy
,
make
me
sure
you
have
more
favour
of
this
kind
to
delight
me
with
,
if
you
please
;
and
may
I
beg
to
be
indulge
on
this
agreeable
head
?
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
say
he
,
my
life
have
be
too
much
a
life
of
gayety
and
action
,
to
be
busy
so
innocently
.
 
<EOS>
some
little
essay
I
have
now
and
then
attempt
;
but
very
few
<EOS>
have
I
complete
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
not
patience
nor
attention
enough
to
hold
me
long
to
any
one
thing
.
 
<EOS>
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
perhaps
,
I
may
occasionally
shew
you
what
I
have
essay
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
could
please
myself
in
this
way

Friday
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
yesterday
favour
with
the
company
of
almost
all
the
neighbouring
gentleman
and
their
lady
,
who
,
by
appointment
with
one
another
,
meet
to
congratulate
our
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
obliging
,
more
free
and
affectionate
,
than
the
lady
;
nothing
more
polite
than
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
perform
(
for
they
come
to
supper
)
with
decency
and
order
,
and
much
to
every
one
's
satisfaction
;
which
be
principally
owe
to
good
Mrs.
Jervis
's
care
and
skill
;
who
be
an
excellent
manager
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
be
dress
out
only
to
be
admire
,
as
it
seem
:
and
truly
,
if
I
have
not
know
,
that
I
do
not
make
myself
,
as
you
,
my
dear
father
,
once
hint
to
me
,
and
if
I
have
have
the
vanity
to
think
as
well
of
myself
,
as
the
good
company
be
pleased
to
do
,
I
may
possibly
have
be
proud
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
,
as
my
Lady
Davers
say
,
though
in
anger
,
yet
in
truth
,
that
I
be
but
a
poor
bit
of
paint
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
I
value
myself
upon
,
be
,
that
God
have
raise
me
to
a
condition
to
be
useful
,
in
my
generation
,
to
well
person
than
myself
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
my
pride
:
<EOS>
and
I
hope
this
will
be
all
my
pride
.
 
<EOS>
for
what
be
I
of
myself
!
 
<EOS>
all
the
good
I
can
do
,
be
but
a
poor
third

hand
good
;
for
my
dear
master
himself
be
but
the
second

hand
.
 
<EOS>
God

be
the

to
him
,
therefore
,
be
all
the
glory
!
  
<EOS>
as
I
expect
the
happiness
,
the
unspeakable
happiness
,
my
ever

and
ever

honour
father
and
mother
,
of
enjoy
you
both
here
,
under
this
roof
,
so
soon
,
(
and
pray
let
it
be
as
soon
as
you
can
,
)
I
will
not
enter
into
the
particular
of
the
last
agreeable
evening
:
<EOS>
for
I
shall
have
a
thousand
thing
,
as
well
as
that
,
to
talk
to
you
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
you
will
be
tired
with
my
prattle
when
I
see
you
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
to
return
these
visit
singly
;
and
there
be
eight
lady
here
of
different
family
.
 
<EOS>
dear
heart
!
<EOS>
I
shall
find
enough
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
my
time
will
not
be
so
well
fill
up
,
as
I
once
promise
my
dear
master
!
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
pleased
,
cheerful
,
kind
,
affectionate
!
 
<EOS>
o
what
a
happy
creature
be
I
!
 
<EOS>
May
I
be
always
thankful
to
God
,
and
grateful
to
him
!
  
<EOS>
when
all
these
tumultuous
visiting
be
over
,
I
shall
have
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
subside
into
a
family
calm
,
that
I
may
make
myself
a
little
useful
to
the
household
of
my
dear
master
;
or
else
I
shall
be
an
unprofitable
servant
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
Lady

for
a
fortnight

<EOS>
I
have
now
<EOS>
but
one
thing
to
wish

methink

I

your

which
I

every

<EOS>
methink
I
want
sadly
your
list
of
the
honest
and
worthy
poor

for
the
money
lie
by
me
,
and
bring
me
no
interest

<EOS>
You
see
I
be
become
a
mere
usurer
;
and
want
to
make
use
upon
use
:
and
yet
,
when
I
have
do
all
,
I
can
not
do
so
much
as
I
ought
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
my
imperfection
!
  
<EOS>
I
tell
my

spouse

I
want
another

<EOS>
to

if

he

not
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of

as
well
as
I

lest
,
poor

pretty

<EOS>
the
reader
will
here
indulge
us
in
a
few
brief
observation
,
which
naturally
result
from
the
story
and
character
;
and
which
will
serve
as
so
many
application
of
its
most
material
incident
to
the
mind
of
youth
of
both
sex
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
in
the
character
of
the
GENTLEMAN
,
may
be
see
that
of
a
fashionable
libertine
,
who
allow
himself
in
the
free
indulgence
of
his
passion
,
especially
to
the
fair
sex
;
and
find
himself
support
in
his
daring
attempt
,
by
an
affluent
fortune
in
possession
,
a
personal
bravery
,
as
it
be
call
,
ready
to
give
than
take
offence
,
and
an
imperious
will
:
yet
as
he
betime
see
his
error
,
and
reform
in
the
bloom
of
youth
,
an
edifying
lesson
may
be
draw
from
it
,
for
the
use
of
such
as
be
bear
to
large
fortune
;
and
who
may
be
teach
,
by
his
example
,
the
inexpressible
difference
between
the
hazard
and
remorse
which
attend
a
profligate
course
of
life
,
and
the
pleasure
which
flow
from
virtuous
love
,
and
benevolent
action
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
character
of
Lady
DAVERS
,
let
the
proud
,
and
the
high
-
bear
,
see
the
deformity
of
unreasonable
passion
,
and
how
weak
and
ridiculous
such
person
must
appear
,
who
suffer
themselves
,
as
be
usually
the
case
,
to
be
hurry
from
the
height
of
violence
,
to
the
most
abject
submission
;
and
subject
themselves
to
be
outdo
by
the
humble
virtue
they
so
much
despise
.
  
<EOS>
let
good
CLERGYMEN
,
in
Mr.
WILLIAMS
,
see
,
that
whatever
displeasure
the
doing
of
their
duty
may
give
,
for
a
time
,
to
their
proud
patron
,
Providence
will
,
at
last
,
reward
their
piety
,
and
turn
their
distress
to
triumph
;
and
make
them
even
more
value
for
a
conduct
that
give
offence
while
the
violence
of
passion
last
,
than
if
they
have
meanly
stoop
to
flatter
or
soothe
the
vice
of
the
great
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
example
of
good
old
ANDREWS
and
his
WIFE
,
let
those
,
who
be
reduce
to
a
low
estate
,
see
,
that
Providence
never
fail
to
reward
their
honesty
and
integrity
:
and
that
God
will
,
in
his
own
good
time
,
extricate
them
,
by
mean
unforeseen
,
out
of
their
present
difficulty
,
and
reward
them
with
benefit
unhoped

<EOS>
the
UPPER

the
odious
character
of
Mrs.

and
the
amiable
one
of
Mrs.

Mr.
LONGMAN

what
to
avoid
,
and
what
to
choose

to
make
themselves
value
and
esteem
by
all
who
know
them

<EOS>
and
,
from
the
double
conduct
of
poor
JOHN

the
LOWER
SERVANTS
may
learn
fidelity
,
and
how
to
distinguish
between
the
lawful
and
unlawful
command
of
a
superior

<EOS>
the
poor
delude
female

who

like
the
once
unhappy
Miss
GODFREY

have
give
up
her
honour

and
yield
to
the
allurement
of
her
designing
lover

learn
from
her
story

to
stop
at
the
first
fault
;
and
,
by
resolve

repent
and
amend

see
the
pardon

blessing
which

her
penitence

and
a
kind
<EOS>
Providence
ready
to
extend
the
arm
of
its
mercy
to
receive
and
reward
her
return
duty

first
inadvertently

herself
into
filthy
disease

an
untimely
death

too
probably

into
everlasting
perdition

<EOS>
let
the
desponding
heart
be
comfort
by
the
happy
issue
which
the
trouble
and
trial
of
PAMELA
meet
with
,
when
they
see
,
in
her
case
,
that
no
danger
nor
distress
,
however
inevitable
,
or
deep
to
their
apprehension
,
can
be
out
of
the
power
of
Providence
to
obviate
or
relieve
;
and
which
,
as
in
various
instance
in
her
story
,
can
turn
the
most
seemingly
grievous
thing
to
its
own
glory
,
and
the
reward
of
suffer
innocence
;
and
that
too
,
at
a
time
when
all
human
prospect
seem
to
fail

<EOS>
let
the
rich

and
those
who
be
exalt
from
a
low

a
high
estate

learn
from
her
,
that
they
be
not

only
for
a
single
good

that
Providence
have
raise
them
,
that
they
should
dispense
to
all
within
their
reach
,
the
blessing
it
have
heap
upon
them

the
great

which
God
hath
raise
them

the
great

the
good
that

from
the
low

her
excellency

not
to
arrogate
to
themselves
those
gift

which

them
to
ourselves

either
prudent

wise

from

their

from

ought
to
make
themselves
useful

give
good
example
to

their

the
first
part
of
PAMELA
meet
with
a
success
greatly
exceed
the
most
sanguine
expectation
:
and
the
Editor
hope
,
that
the
letter
which
compose
this
part
will
be
find
equally
write
to
NATURE
,
avoid
all
romantic
night
,
improbable

,
and
irrational
machinery
;
and
the
passion
be
touch
,
where
requisite
;
and
rule
,
equally
new
and
practicable
,
inculcate
throughout
the
whole
,
for
the
general
conduct
of
life
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
flatter
himself
,
that
they
may
expect
the
good
fortune
,
which
few
continuation
have
meet
with
,
to
be
judge
not
unworthy
the
first
Part
;
nor
disproportione
to
the
more
exalted
condition
in
which
PAMELA
be
destine
to
shine
as
an
affectionate
wife
,
a
faithful
friend
,
a
polite
and
kind
neighbour
,
an
indulgent
mother
,
and
a
beneficent
mistress
;
after
have
in
the
former
Part
support
the
character
of
a
dutiful
child
,
a
spotless
virgin
,
and
a
modest
and
amiable
bride

<EOS>
the
reader
will
easily
see

that
in
so
great
a
choice
of
material
,
as
must
arise
from
a
multitude
of

to

as
those
of
Mr.

<EOS>
the

's
great
difficulty
be
how
to
bring
them
within
the
compass
which
he
be
determine
not
to
exceed
.
<EOS>
and
it
have
be
leave
to
his
own
choice
,
in
what
manner
to
digest
and
publish
the
letter
,
and
where
to
close
the
work
<EOS>
,
he
have
intend
,
at
first
,
in
regard
to
his
other
avocation
,
to
have
carry
the
piece
no
farther
than
the
First
Part
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
expect
,
therefore
,
that
he
should
enter
into
an
explanation
of
the
reason
whereby
he
be
provoke
into
a
necessity
of
alter
his
intention
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
willing
to
decline
say
any
thing
upon
so
well
-
know
a
subject
.
  
<EOS>
the
Editor
have
be
much
press
with
importunity
and
conjecture
,
in
relation
to
the
person
and
family
of
the
gentleman

who
be
the
principal
person
in
the
work
;
all
he
think
himself
at
liberty
to
say
,
or
be
necessary
to
be
say
,
be
only
to
repeat
what
have
already
be
hint
,
that
the
story
have
its
foundation
in
truth
;
and
that
there
be
a
necessity
,
for
obvious
reason
,
to
vary
and
disguise

My
dear
father
and
mother
,
  
<EOS>
We
arrive
here
last
night
,
highly
pleased
with
our
journey
,
and
the
occasion
of
it
.
<EOS>
May
God
bless
you
both
with
long
life
and
health
,
to
enjoy
your
sweet
farm
,
and
pretty
dwelling
,
which
be
just
what
I
wish
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
and
do
not
make
your
grateful
heart
too
uneasy
in
the
possession
of
it
,
by
your
modest
diffidence
of
your
own
unworthiness
:
for
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
it
be
what
will
do
honour
to
the
good
of
man
<EOS>
,
it
be
not
so
very
extraordinary
,
consider
his
condition
,
as
to
cause
any
one
to
censure
it
as
the
effect
of
a
too
partial
and
injudicious
kindness
for
the
parent
of
one
whom
he
delighteth
to
honour
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
master
(
why
should
I
not
still
call
him
so
,
bind
to
reverence
him
as
I
be
,
in
every
light
he
can
shine
in
to
the
most
obliging
and
sensible
heart
?
)
<EOS>
still
propose
to
fit
up
the
large
parlour
,
and
three
apartment
in
the
commodious
dwelling
<EOS>
he
call
yours
,
for
his
entertainment
and
mine
,
when
I
pay
my
duty
to
you
both
,
for
a
few
happy
day
;
and
he
have
actually
give
order
to
that
effect
;
and
that
the
three
apartment
be
so
fit
up
,
as
to
be
rather
suitable
to
your
condition
,
than
his
own
;
for
,
he
say
,
the
plain
simple
elegance
,
which
he
will
have
observe
in
the
room
,
as
well
as
the
furniture
,
will
be
a
variety
in
his
retirement
to
this
place
,
that
will
make
him
return
to
his
own
with
the
great
pleasure
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
when
we
be
not
there
,
will
be
of
use
for
the
reception
of
any
of
your
friend
;
and
so
he
shall
not
,
as
he
kindly
say
,
rob
the
good
couple
of
any
of
their
accommodation
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
bow
-
window
he
will
have
preserve
,
but
will
not
have
them
sashe
,
nor
the
woodbine
,
jessamine
,
and
vine
<EOS>
,
that
run
up
against
them
,
destroy
:
only
he
will
have
large
pane
of
glass
,
and
more
convenient
casement
to
let
in
the
sweet
air
and
light
,
and
make
amend
for
that
obstruct
by
the
shade
of
those
fragrant
climber
.
<EOS>
for
he
have
mention
,
three
or
four
time
,
how
gratefully
they
dispense
their
intermingled
odour
to
us
,
when
,
the
last
evening
we
stand
at
the
window
,
to
hear
the
responsive
song
of
two
warble
nightingale
,
one
at
a
distance
,
the
other
near
,
which
delight
us
for
above
two
hour
,
and
the
more
,
as
we
think
their
season
have
be
over
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
have
do
,
he
make
me
sing
him
one
,
for
which
he
reward
me
with
a
kiss
,
say
,
"
how
greatly
do
the
innocent
pleasure
I
now
hourly
taste
,
exceed
the
guilty
tumult
that
use
formerly
to
agitate
my
unequal
mind
!
 
<EOS>
never
talk
,
my
Pamela
,
as
you
frequently
do
,
of
obligation
to
me
:
<EOS>
one
such
hour
as
I
now
enjoy
be
an
ample
reward
for
all
the
benefit
I
can
confer
on
you
and
your
in
my
whole
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
parlour
will
indeed
be
more
elegant
;
though
that
be
to
be
rather
plain
than
rich
,
as
well
in
its
wainscot
as
furniture
,
and
to
be
new
-
floored
.
<EOS>
the
dear
gentleman
have
already
give
order
,
and
you
will
soon
have
workman
to
put
them
in
execution
.
<EOS>
the
parlour
-
door
be
to
have
brass
-
hinge
and
lock
,
and
to
shut
as
close
,
he
tell
them
,
as
a
watch
-
case
:
"
for
who
know
,
"
say
he
,
"
my
dear
,
but
we
shall
have
still
add
blessing
,
in
two
or
three
charming
boy
and
girl
,
to
place
there
in
their
infancy
,
before
they
can
be
of
age
to
be
benefit
by
your
lesson
and
example
?
<EOS>
and
besides
,
I
shall
no
doubt
entertain
there
<EOS>
some
of
my
choose
friend
,
in
their
excursion
for
a
day
or
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
how
be
I
,
every
hour
of
my
life
,
overwhelm
with
instance
of
God
Almighty
's
goodness
and
his
!
<EOS>
o
spare
,
bless
Father
of
Mercies
,
the
precious
life
of
this
excellent
man
<EOS>
;
increase
my
thankfulness
,
and
my
worthiness
;
 
and
then
 
<EOS>
but
what
shall
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
only
that
I
may
continue
to
be
what
I
be
;
for
more
blessed
and
happy
,
in
my
own
mind
,
I
can
not
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
bed
he
will
have
of
cloth
,
as
he
think
the
situation
a
little
cold
,
especially
when
the
wind
be
easterly
,
and
purpose
to
be
down
in
the
early
spring
season
,
now
and
then
,
as
well
as
in
the
latter
autumn
;
and
the
window
curtain
of
the
same
,
in
one
room
red
,
in
the
other
green
;
but
<EOS>
plain
,
lest
you
should
be
afraid
to
use
them
occasionally
.
<EOS>
the
carpet
for
them
will
be
send
with
the
other
furniture
;
for
he
will
not
alter
the
old
oaken
floor
of
the
bed
-
chamber
,
nor
the
little
room
he
intend
for
my
use
,
when
I
choose
not
to
join
in
such
company
as
may
happen
to
fall
in
:
"
which
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
shall
be
as
little
as
be
possible
,
only
particular
friend
,
who
may
be
dispose
,
once
in
a
year
or
two
,
to
see
when
I
be
there
,
how
I
live
with
my
Pamela
and
her
parent
,
and
how
I
pass
my
time
in
my
retirement
,
as
I
shall
call
this
:
or
,
perhaps
,
they
will
be
apt
to
think
me
ashamed
of
company
I
shall
always
be
pleased
with
.
<EOS>
nor
be
you
,
my
dear
,
to
take
this
as
a
compliment
to
yourself
,
but
a
piece
of
requisite
policy
in
me
:
for
who
will
offer
to
reproach
me
with
marrying
,
as
the
world
think
,
below
me
,
when
they
shall
see
that
I
not
only
pride
myself
in
my
Pamela
,
but
take
pleasure
in
own
her
relation
as
mine
,
and
visit
them
,
and
receive
visit
from
them
:
and
yet
offer
not
to
set
them
up
in
such
a
glaring
light
,
as
if
I
would
have
the
world
forget
(
who
in
that
case
would
always
take
the
more
pleasure
in
remember
)
what
they
be
!
<EOS>
and
how
will
it
anticipate
low
reflection
,
when
they
shall
see
,
I
can
bend
my
mind
to
partake
with
them
the
pleasure
of
their
humble
but
decent
life
?
 
<EOS>
ay
,
"
continue
he
,
"
and
be
reward
for
it
too
,
with
well
health
,
well
spirit
,
and
a
well
mind
;
so
that
,
my
dear
,
"
add
he
,
"
I
shall
reap
more
benefit
by
what
I
propose
to
do
,
than
I
shall
confer
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
generous
manner
do
this
good
of
man
endeavour
to
disclaim
(
though
I
must
be
very
ungrateful
,
if
,
with
me
,
it
do
not
enhance
)
<EOS>
the
proper
merit
of
a
beneficence
natural
to
him
;
and
which
,
indeed
,
as
I
tell
him
,
may
be
in
one
respect
deprecate
,
inasmuch
as
(
so
excellent
be
his
nature
)
<EOS>
he
can
not
help
it
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
o
that
it
be
in
my
power
to
recompense
him
for
it
!
<EOS>
but
I
be
poor
,
as
I
have
often
say
,
in
every
thing
but
will
 
and
that
be
wholly
his
:
and
what
a
happiness
be
it
to
me
,
a
happiness
I
could
not
so
early
have
hope
for
,
that
I
can
say
so
without
reserve
;
since
the
dear
object
of
it
require
nothing
of
me
but
what
be
consistent
with
my
duty
to
the
Supreme
Benefactor
,
the
first
mover
and
cause
of
all
his
own
happiness
,
of
my
happiness
,
and
that
of
my
dear
,
my
ever
dear
parent
.
  
<EOS>
Your
dutiful
and
happy
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
my
dearest
daughter
,
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
repeat
to
you
<EOS>
the
sense
<EOS>
your
good
mother
<EOS>
and
I
have
of
our
happiness
,
and
of
our
obligation
to
your
honoured
spouse
;
you
both
be
pleased
witness
of
it
every
hour
of
the
happy
fortnight
you
pass
with
us
.
<EOS>
yet
,
my
dear
,
we
hardly
know
how
to
address
ourselves
even
to
you
,
much
less
to
the
'
squire
,
with
the
freedom
he
so
often
invite
us
to
take
:
for
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
though
you
be
our
daughter
,
and
so
far
from
be
lift
up
by
your
high
condition
,
that
we
see
no
difference
in
your
behaviour
to
us
,
your
poor
parent
,
yet
,
view
you
as
the
lady
of
so
fine
a
gentleman
,
we
can
not
forbear
have
a
kind
of
respect
,
and
 
I
do
not
know
what
to
call
it
 
that
lay
a
little
restraint
upon
us
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
we
should
not
,
methink
,
let
our
mind
be
run
away
with
the
admiration
of
worldly
grandeur
,
so
as
to
set
too
much
by
it
.
<EOS>
but
your
merit
and
prudence
be
so
much
above
all
we
could
ever
have
any
notion
of
:
and
to
have
gentry
come
only
to
behold
and
admire
you
,
not
so
much
for
your
gentleness
,
and
amiableness
,
or
for
your
behaviour
,
and
affability
to
poor
as
well
as
rich
,
and
to
hear
every
one
call
you
an
angel
,
and
say
,
you
deserve
to
be
what
you
be
,
make
us
hardly
know
how
to
look
upon
you
,
but
as
an
angel
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
have
be
a
good
angel
to
us
;
since
,
for
your
sake
,
God
Almighty
have
put
it
into
your
honoured
husband
's
heart
to
make
us
the
happy
couple
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
little
less
we
should
have
be
,
have
we
only
in
some
far
distant
land
hear
of
our
dear
child
's
happiness
and
never
partaken
of
the
benefit
of
it
ourselves
.
<EOS>
but
thus
to
be
provide
for
!
<EOS>
thus
kindly
to
be
own
,
and
call
Father
and
Mother
by
such
a
brave
gentleman
!
<EOS>
and
so
place
as
to
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
bless
God
,
him
,
and
you
,
and
hourly
pray
for
you
both
<EOS>
,
be
a
providence
too
mighty
to
be
bear
by
us
,
with
equalness
of
temper
:
we
kneel
together
every
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
and
weep
and
rejoice
,
and
rejoice
and
weep
,
to
think
how
our
unworthiness
be
distinguished
,
and
how
God
have
provide
for
us
in
our
latter
day
;
when
all
our
fear
be
,
that
,
as
we
grow
old
and
more
infirm
,
and
wear
out
by
hard
labour
,
we
should
be
troublesome
<EOS>
where
,
not
our
pride
,
but
our
industrious
will
,
would
have
make
us
wish
not
to
be
so
;
 
but
to
be
entitle
to
a
happy
lot
:
for
this
would
have
grieve
us
the
more
,
for
the
sake
of
you
,
my
dear
child
,
and
your
unhappy
brother
's
child
:
for
it
be
well
know
,
that
,
though
we
pretend
not
to
boast
of
our
family
,
and
indeed
have
no
reason
,
yet
none
of
us
be
ever
sink
so
low
as
I
be
:
to
be
sure
,
partly
by
my
own
fault
;
for
,
have
it
be
for
your
poor
aged
mother
's
sake
only
,
I
ought
not
to
have
do
what
I
do
for
John
and
William
;
for
so
unhappy
be
they
,
poor
lad
!
<EOS>
that
what
I
could
do
,
be
but
as
a
drop
of
water
to
a
bucket
.
  
<EOS>
You
command
me
 
<EOS>
let
me
,
as
write
to
Mr.
B.
's
lady
,
say
command
,
though
,
as
to
my
dear
daughter
,
I
will
only
say
desire
:
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
will
not
,
as
you
wish
me
not
to
do
<EOS>
,
let
the
one
condition
,
which
be
accidental
,
put
the
other
,
which
be
natural
,
out
of
my
thought
:
you
speak
it
in
well
word
,
but
this
be
the
sense
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
the
gift
of
utterance
;
and
education
be
a
fine
thing
,
where
it
meet
with
such
talent
to
improve
upon
,
as
God
have
give
you
.
<EOS>
yet
let
me
not
forget
what
I
be
go
to
say
 
You
command
 
<EOS>
or
,
if
you
please
 
you
desire
me
to
write
long
letter
,
and
<EOS>
often
 
and
how
can
I
help
it
,
if
I
would
?
<EOS>
for
when
here
,
in
this
happy
dwelling
,
and
this
well
-
stock
farm
,
in
these
rich
meadow
,
and
well
-
cropt
acre
,
we
look
around
us
,
and
which
way
soever
we
turn
our
head
,
see
blessing
upon
blessing
,
and
plenty
upon
plenty
,
see
barn
well
store
,
poultry
increase
,
the
kine
low
and
crowd
about
us
:
and
be
bid
to
call
them
our
own
.
<EOS>
then
think
,
that
all
be
the
reward
of
our
child
's
virtue
!
 
<EOS>
o
my
dear
daughter
,
who
can
bear
these
thing
!
 
<EOS>
excuse
me
!
<EOS>
I
must
break
off
a
little
!
<EOS>
for
my
eye
be
as
full
as
my
heart
:
and
I
will
retire
to
bless
God
,
and
your
honoured
husband
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
my
dear
child
,
I
now
again
take
up
my
pen
:
but
read
what
I
have
write
,
in
order
to
carry
on
the
thread
,
I
can
hardly
forbear
again
be
in
one
sort
affected
.
<EOS>
but
do
you
think
I
will
call
all
these
thing
my
own
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
would
live
rent
-
free
?
<EOS>
Can
the
honoured
"
squire
believe
,
that
have
such
a
generous
example
before
me
,
if
I
have
no
gratitude
in
my
temper
before
,
I
could
help
be
touch
by
such
an
one
as
he
set
me
?
<EOS>
if
this
goodness
make
him
know
no
mean
in
giving
,
shall
I
be
so
greedy
as
to
know
none
in
receiving
?
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
my
dear
child
,
your
poor
father
be
not
so
sordid
a
wretch
,
neither
.
<EOS>
He
will
shew
the
world
that
all
these
benefit
be
not
throw
away
upon
one
,
who
will
disgrace
you
as
much
by
his
temper
,
as
by
his
condition
.
<EOS>
what
though
I
can
not
be
as
worthy
of
all
these
favour
as
I
wish
,
I
will
be
as
worthy
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
and
let
me
tell
you
,
my
dear
child
,
if
the
king
and
his
royal
family
(
God
bless
'
em
!
)
<EOS>
be
not
ashamed
to
receive
taxis
and
duty
from
his
subject
;
if
duke
and
earl
,
and
all
the
top
gentry
,
can
not
support
their
bravery
,
without
have
their
rent
pay
;
I
hope
I
shall
not
affront
the
"
squire
,
to
pay
to
his
steward
,
what
any
other
person
would
pay
for
his
noble
stock
,
and
improve
farm
:
and
I
will
do
it
,
if
it
please
God
to
bless
me
with
life
and
health
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
worthy
to
crawl
upon
the
earth
,
if
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
I
say
to
Mr.
Longman
,
the
faithful
Mr.
Longman
!
<EOS>
sure
no
gentleman
have
ever
a
more
worthy
steward
than
he
<EOS>
:
it
be
as
we
be
walk
over
the
ground
together
,
and
observe
in
<EOS>
what
good
order
every
thing
be
,
he
be
praise
some
little
contrivance
of
my
own
,
for
the
improvement
of
the
farm
,
and
say
,
how
comfortably
he
hope
we
may
live
upon
it
.
"
<EOS>
ay
,
Mr.
Longman
,
"
say
I
,
"
comfortably
indeed
:
<EOS>
but
do
you
think
I
could
be
properly
say
to
live
,
if
I
be
not
to
pay
as
much
rent
for
it
as
another
?
"
    
"
I
can
tell
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
"
squire
will
not
receive
any
thing
from
you
,
Goodman
Andrews
.
<EOS>
why
,
man
,
he
have
no
occasion
for
it
:
he
be
worth
a
power
of
money
,
besides
a
noble
and
clear
estate
in
land
.
<EOS>
ad'
-
heartlikens
,
you
must
not
affront
him
,
I
can
tell
you
that
:
he
be
as
generous
as
a
prince
,
where
he
take
;
but
he
be
hasty
,
and
will
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
for
that
reason
,
Mr.
Longman
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
be
think
to
make
you
my
friend

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
make
me
your

You
have
not
a
well
in
the
world
,
to
my
power
,
I
can
tell
you
that
,
nor
your
dame
neither
;
for
I
love
such
honest
heart
<EOS>
:
I
wish
my
own
brother
would
let
me
love
him
as
well
;
but
let
that
pass
.
<EOS>
what
I
can
do
for
you
,
I
will
,
and
here
be
my
hand
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
<EOS>
"
it
be
this
:
let
me
account
to
you
at
the
rent
Farmer
Dickens
offer
,
and
let
me
know
what
the
stock
cost
,
and
what
the
crop
be
value
at
;
and
pay
the
one
as
I
can
,
and
the
other
quarterly
;
and
not
let
the
"
squire
know
it
till
you
can
not
choose
;
and
I
shall
be
as
happy
as
a
prince
;
<EOS>
for
I
doubt
not
,
by
God
's
blessing
,
to
make
a
comfortable
livelihood
of
it
besides
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
dost
believe
,
Goodman
Andrews
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
I
would
do
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
Would
not
his
honour
think
if
I
hide
one

from
him
,
I
may
hide
another
?
<EOS>
go
to

honest

I
love
thee

can
Mr.

much
for

(

me
so
<EOS>

I

,
"
I

at
bottom
there

no

I

if
I

any

it
be
only
in
my

under

all

some
how

<EOS>
and
so
,
my

I
resolve
it
shall
;
and
it
will
be
,
over
and
above
,
one
of
the
great
pleasure
to
me
,
to
do
the
good

service
,
as
well
as
to
be
so
much
benefit

him

<EOS>
Our
eld
grandson
Thomas
desire
to
come

live
with
us
<EOS>
:
the

be
honest

I

industrious

<EOS>
and
cousin
Borroughs
want
me
to
employ
his
son
Roger
,
who
understand
the
business
of
a
farm
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
,
that
all
one
's
relation
should
wish
to
partake
of
our
happy
lot
;
and
if
they
can
and
will
do
their
business
as
well
as
other
<EOS>
,
I
see
not
why
relationship
should
be
an
objection
:
<EOS>
but
,
yet
,
I
think
,
one
should
not
beleaguer
,
as
one
may
say
,
your
honoured
husband
with
one
's
relation
.
<EOS>
You
,
my
good
child
,
will
give
me
always
your
advice
,
as
to
my
carriage
in
this
my
new
lot
;
for
I
would
not
for

be
think
an
encroacher

<EOS>
and
you
have
so
follow
than
yours

Our

I
be

<EOS>
attend
you
,
my

child

and
may
you
be
as
happy
as
you
have
make
us
<EOS>
(
I
can
not

you
to
be
happy
,
because
I
have
no

how
it

May
we
hope
to
be
favour
now

then
with
a
letter
from
you
,
my

like
some
of
your
former
,
to
let
us
know
how
you
go
on
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
joy
to
us
;
indeed
it
would
.
<EOS>
but
we
know
you
will
have
enough
to
do
without
oblige
us
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
so
must
acquiesce
.
    
<EOS>
my

FATHER

I
have
shew
your
letter

my

<EOS>
do
not

uneasy

I
have

for
you
nee
not

ashamed
of
it
,
since
it
be
my
pride
to
have
such
honest
and
grateful
parent
:
and
I
will
tell
you
what
he
say
to
it
,
as
the
good
argument
I
can
use
,
why
you
should
not
be
uneasy
,
but
enjoy
without
pain
or
anxiety
all
the
benefit
of
your
happy
lot

"
dear
good
soul

now
every

you
love

revere
such
honest
mind

that

be
they
not
your

tell
them
,
that
I
be
so
far
from
have
them
believe
what
I
have
do
for
them
be
only
from
my
affection
for
their
daughter
,
<EOS>
that
let
'em
find
out
another
couple
as
worthy
as
they
be

I
will
do
as
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
place
them
,
"
he
continue

"
in
the
same
county

because
I
would
wish
two
county
to
be
bless
for

tell
them
,
my

that
they
have
a
right

what
they
enjoy
on
the
foot
of
their
own
proper
merit

and
bid
them
enjoy
it
as
their
patrimony
;
and
if
any
thing
arise
that
be
more
than
they
themselves
can
wish
for
,
in
their
way
of
life
,
let
them
look
among
their
own

where
it
may
be
acceptable

communicate
to
them
the

solid
reason
for
rejoice
in
the
situation

you

should
deny
any
comfort
to
themselves

in

to
do
good
to

<EOS>
I
could
only
fly
to
his
generous
bosom
(
for
this
be
a
subject
which
most
affect
me

,
and
,
with
my

swim
in
tear

which
overflow

and
,
indeed
,
my

go
flutter

flutter

flutter

at

thus
from

,
ought
not
the
sense
we
have
of
our
happiness
to
make
our
expression
soar
equally
?
<EOS>
Can
the
affection
be
so
highly
raise
as
mine
be
on
these
occasion
,
and
the
thought
creep
grovel
like
one
's
ordinary
self
?
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
call
not
this
,
therefore
,
the
gift
of
utterance
,
if
it
should
appear
to
you
in
a
well
light
than
it
deserve
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
gift
of
gratitude
;
a
gift
which
make
you
and
me
to
speak
and
write
,
as
I
hope
it
will
make
us
act
,
above
ourselves
.
<EOS>
thus
will
our
gratitude
be
the
inspirer
of
joy
to
our
common
benefactor
;
and
his
joy
will
heighten
our
gratitude
;
and
so
we
shall
proceed
,
as
cause
and
effect
to
each
other
's
happiness
,
to
bless
the
dear
man
who
bless
us
.
<EOS>
and
will
it
be
right
then
to
say
,
you
be
uneasy
under
such
(
at
least
as
to
your
will
)
return
and
discharge
obligation
?
<EOS>
God
Almighty
require
only
a
thankful
heart
for
all
the
mercy
he
heap
upon
the
child
of
man
;
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
who
in
these
particular
imitate
Divinity
,
desire
no
more
.
<EOS>
You
have
this
thankful
heart
;
and
that
to
such
a
high
degree
of
gratitude
,
that
nobody
can
exceed
you
.
  
<EOS>
but
yet
,
when
your
worthy
mind
would
be
too
much
affected
with
your
gratitude
,
so
as
to
lay
under
the
restraint
you
mention
,
to
the
dear
gentleman
,
and
for
his
sake
,
to
your
dependent
daughter
;
let
me
humbly
advise
you
,
with
more
particular
,
more
abstracted
aspiration
,
than
at
other
time
,
to
raise
your
thought
upwards
,
and
consider
who
it
be
that
give
him
the
opportunity
;
and
pray
for
him
and
for
me
;
for
him
,
that
all
his
future
action
may
be
of
a
piece
with
this
noble
disposition
of
mind
;
for
me
,
that
I
may
continue
humble
,
and
consider
myself
bl
for
your
sake
,
and
in
order
that
I
may
be
,
in
some
sort
,
a
rewarder
,
in
the
hand
of
Providence
,
of
this
its
dear
excellent
agent
;
and
then
we
shall
look
forward
,
all
of
us
,
with
pleasure
,
indeed
,
to
that
state
,
where
there
be
no
distinction
of
degree
,
and
where
the
humble
cottager
shall
be
upon
a
par
with
the
proud
monarch
.
  
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
parent
,
how
can
you
,
as
in
your
postscript
,
say
,
"
May
we
not
be
favour
now
-
and
-
then
with
a
letter
?
<EOS>
"
call
me
your
daughter
,
your
Pamela
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
lady
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
more
pleasure
to
be
call
your
comfort
,
and
think
to
act
worthy
of
the
sentiment
with
which
your
example
and
instruction
have
inspire
me
,
than
in
any
other
thing
in
this
life
;
my
determined
duty
to
our
common
benefactor
,
the
good
of
gentleman
and
husband
,
except
.
<EOS>
God
have
bless
me
for
your
sake
,
and
have
thus
answer
for
me
all
your
prayer
;
nay
,
more
than
answer
all
you
or
I
could
have
wish
or
hope
for
.
<EOS>
We
only
pray
,
only
hope
,
that
God
would
preserve
you
honest
,
and
me
virtuous
:
and
,
o
see
,
<EOS>
my
excellent
parent
,
how
we
be
crown
with
blessing
upon
blessing
,
till
we
be
the
talk
of
all
that
know
us
.
  
<EOS>
hence
,
my
dear
parent
(
I
mean
,
from
the
delight
I
have
in
write
to
you
,
which
transport
me
far
above
my
own
sphere
)
,
you
will
see
,
that
I
must
write
,
and
can
not
help
it
,
if
I
would
.
<EOS>
and
will
it
be
a
great
joy
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
and
be
there
any
thing
that
can
add
to
your
joy
,
think
you
,
in
the
power
of
your
Pamela
,
that
she
would
not
do
?
<EOS>
o
that
the
life
and
health
of
my
dear
Mr.
B.
and
you
,
my
parent
,
may
be
continue
to
me
!
<EOS>
and
who
can
then
be
so
blest
as
your
Pamela
?
  
<EOS>
I
will
write
,
depend
upon
it
,
on
every
occasion
 
<EOS>
and
you
augment
my
joy
to
think
it
be
in
my
power
to
add
to
your
comfort
.
<EOS>
nor
can
you
conceive
my
pleasure
in
hope
that
this
your
new
happy
lot
may
,
by
relieve
you
from
corrode
care
,
and
the
too
weary
effect
of
hard
labour
,
add
,
in
these
your
advanced
year
,
to
both
your
day
.
<EOS>
for
,
so
happy
be
I
,
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
grief
,
no
pain
,
in
look
forward
,
but
from
reflect
,
that
one
day
we
must
be
separate
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
fit
that
we
so
comport
ourselves
as
not
to
embitter
our
present
happiness
with
prospect
too
gloomy
 
but
bring
our
mind
to
be
cheerfully
thankful
for
the
present
,
wisely
to
enjoy
that
present
as
we
go
along
 
and
at
last
,
when
all
be
to
be
wind
up
 
lie
down
,
and
say
,
"
not
mine
,
but
Thy
will
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
write
much
;
yet
have
still
more
to
say
relate
to
other
part
of
your
kind
acceptable
letter
;
and
so
will
soon
write
again
:
<EOS>
for
I
must
think
every
opportunity
happy
,
<EOS>
whereby
I
can
assure
you
,
how
much
I
be
,
and
will
ever
be
,
without
any
addition
to
my
name
,
if
it
will
make
you
easy
,
your
dutiful
  
PAMELA
.
    
<EOS>
my
dearest
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
I
now
write
again
,
as
I
tell
you
I
should
in
my
last
;
but
I
be
half
afraid
to
look
at
the
copy
of
it
;
for
your
worthy
heart
,
so
visible
in
your
letter
and
<EOS>
my
beloved
's
kind
deportment
upon
shew
it
to
him
,
raise
me
into
a
frame
of
mind
,
border
on
ecstasy
:
yet
I
write
my
heart
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
,
my
dear
father
,
write
to
your
Pamela
so
affectingly
.
<EOS>
Your
steady
mind
could
hardly
bear
your
own
moving
strain
,
and
you
be
force
to
lay
down
your
pen
,
and
retire
:
how
then
could
I
,
who
love
you
so
dearly
,
if
you
have
not
increase
that
love
by
fresh
and
strong
instance
of
your
worthiness
,
forbear
be
affect
,
and
raise
above
myself
!
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
again
touch
upon
this
subject
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
then
,
that
my
dear
spouse
command
me
,
with
his
kind
respect
,
to
tell
you
,
he
have
think
of
a
method
to
make
your
worthy
heart
easy
;
those
be
his
word
:
"
and
this
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
by
put
that
whole
estate
,
with
the
new
purchase
,
under
your
father
's
care
,
as
I
at
first
intend
:
he
shall
receive
and
pay
,
and
order
every
thing
as
he
please
:
and
Longman
,
who
grow
in
year
,
shall
be
ease
of
that
burden
.
<EOS>
Your
father
write
a
very
legible
hand
,
and
shall
take
what
assistant
he
please
;
and
do
you
,
Pamela
,
see
that
this
new
task
be
make
as
easy
and
pleasant
to
him
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
shall
make
up
his
account
only
to
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
and
there
will
be
several
pleasure
arise
to
me
upon
it
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
it
will
be
a
relief
to
honest
Longman
,
who
have
business
enough
on
his
hand
.
<EOS>
next
,
it
will
make
the
good
couple
easy
,
to
have
an
opportunity
of
enjoy
that
as
their
due
,
which
now
their
too
grateful
heart
give
them
so
many
causeless
scruple
about
.
<EOS>
thirdly
,
it
will
employ
your
father
's
time
,
more
suitably
to
your
liking
and
mine
,
because
with
more
ease
to
himself
;
for
you
see
his
industrious
will
can
not
be
satisfied
without
do
something
.
<EOS>
in
the
fourth
place
,
the
management
of
this
estate
will
gain
him
more
respect
and
reverence
among
the
tenant
and
his
neighbour
:
and
yet
be
all
in
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
for
,
"
add
he
,
"
you
will
see
,
that
it
be
always
one
point
in
view
with
me
,
to
endeavour
to
convince
every
one
,
that
I
esteem
and
value
them
for
their
own
intrinsic
merit
,
and
want
not
any
body
to
distinguish
them
in
any
other
light
than
that
in
which
they
have
be
accustom
to
appear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
my
dear
father
,
the
instrument
will
be
draw
,
and
bring
you
by
honest
Mr.
Longman
,
who
will
be
with
you
in
a
few
day
to
put
the
last
hand
to
the
new
purchase
,
and
to
give
you
possession
of
your
new
commission
,
if
you
accept
it
,
as
I
hope
you
will
;
and
the
rather
,
for
my
dear
Mr.
B.
's
third
reason
;
and
know
that
this
trust
will
be
discharge
as
worthily
and
as
sufficiently
,
after
you
be
use
to
it
,
as
if
Mr.
Longman
himself
be
in
it
 
and
better
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
be
very
fond
of
this
relief
,
and
long
to
be
down
to
settle
every
thing
with
you
,
as
to
the
proper
power
,
the
method
,
&
c.
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
in
his
usual
phrase
,
that
he
will
make
it
as
easy
to
you
as
a
glove
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
do
accept
it
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
will
leave
every
thing
to
you
,
as
to
rent
,
where
not
already
fix
,
and
,
likewise
,
as
to
act
of
kindness
and
favour
to
be
do
where
you
think
proper
;
and
he
say
,
that
,
with
his
bad
quality
,
he
be
ever
deem
a
kind
landlord
;
and
that
I
can
confirm
in
fifty
instance
to
his
honour
:
"
<EOS>
so
that
the
old
gentleman
,
"
say
he
,
"
need
not
be
afraid
of
be
put
upon
severe
or
harsh
method
of
proceeding
,
where
thing
will
do
without
;
and
he
can
always
befriend
an
honest
man
;
by
which
mean
the
province
will
be
entirely
such
a
one
as
suit
with
his
inclination
.
<EOS>
if
any
thing
difficult
or
perplex
arise
<EOS>
,
"
continue
he
,
"
or
where
a
little
knowledge
in
law
-
matter
be
necessary
,
Longman
shall
do
all
that
:
and
your
father
will
see
that
he
will
not
have
in
those
point
a
coadjutor
too
hard
-
hearted
for
his
wish
;
for
it
be
a
rule
my
father
set
me
,
and
I
have
strictly
follow
,
that
although
I
have
a
lawyer
for
my
steward
,
it
be
rather
to
know
how
to
do
right
thing
,
than
oppressive
one
;
and
Longman
have
so
well
answer
this
intention
,
that
he
be
always
more
noted
for
compose
difference
,
than
promote
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
my
dear
father
,
this
will
be
acceptable
to
you
,
on
the
several
account
my
dear
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
be
pleased
to
mention
:
and
what
a
charming
contrivance
be
here
!
<EOS>
God
for
ever
bless
his
considerate
heart
for
it
!
<EOS>
to
make
you
useful
to
him
,
and
easy
to
yourself
:
as
well
as
respect
by
,
and
even
a
benefactor
to
all
around
you
!
<EOS>
what
can
one
say
to
all
thing
?
<EOS>
but
what
signify
exult
on
one
's
gratitude
for
one
benefit
;
 
every
hour
the
dear
man
heap
new
one
upon
us
,
and
we
can
hardly
thank
him
for
one
,
but
a
second
,
and
a
third
,
and
so
on
to
countless
degree
,
confound
one
,
and
throw
back
our
word
upon
our
heart
before
they
be
well
form
,
and
oblige
us
to
sit
down
under
all
with
profound
silence
and
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
desire
of
cousin
Thomas
,
and
Roger
,
to
live
with
you
,
I
endeavour
to
sound
what
our
dear
benefactor
's
opinion
be
.
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
say
,
"
I
have
no
choice
in
this
case
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Your
father
be
his
own
master
:
he
may
employ
whom
he
please
;
and
,
if
they
shew
respect
to
him
and
your
mother
,
I
think
,
as
he
rightly
observe
,
relationship
should
rather
have
the
preference
;
and
as
he
can
remedy
inconvenience
,
if
he
find
any
,
by
all
mean
to
let
every
branch
of
your
family
have
reason
to
rejoice
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
have
think
of
this
matter
a
good
deal
,
since
I
have
the
favour
of
your
letter
;
and
I
hope
,
since
you
condescend
to
ask
my
advice
,
you
will
excuse
me
,
if
I
give
it
freely
;
yet
entirely
submit
all
to
your
liking
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
I
think
it
better
to
have
any
body
than
relation
;
and
for
these
reason
:
  
one
be
apt
to
expect
more
regard
from
them
,
and
they
more
indulgence
than
stranger
can
hope
for
.
  
<EOS>
that
where
there
be
such
a
difference
in
the
expectation
of
both
,
uneasiness
can
not
but
arise
.
  
<EOS>
that
this
will
subject
you
to
bear
it
,
or
to
resent
it
,
and
to
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
if
you
bear
it
,
you
will
know
no
end
of
imposition
:
if
you
dismiss
them
,
it
will
occasion
ill
-
will
.
<EOS>
They
will
call
you
unkind
;
and
you
them
ungrateful
:
and
as
your
prosperous
lot
may
raise
you
envier
,
such
will
be
apt
to
believe
them
rather
than
you
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
world
will
be
incline
to
think
that
we
be
crowd
upon
a
generous
gentleman
a
numerous
family
of
indigent
people
;
and
it
will
be
say
,
"
the
girl
be
fill
every
place
with
her
relation
,
and
beleaguer
,
"
as
you
significantly
express
it
,
"
a
worthy
gentleman
;
"
should
one
's
kindre
behave
ever
so
worthily
.
<EOS>
so
,
in
the
next
place
,
one
would
not
,
for
their
sake
,
that
this
should
be
do
;
who
may
live
with
less
reproach
,
and
equal
benefit
,
any
where
else
;
for
I
would
not
wish
any
one
of
them
to
be
lift
out
of
his
station
,
and
make
independent
,
at
Mr.
B.
's
expense
,
if
their
industry
will
not
do
it
;
although
I
would
never
scruple
to
do
any
thing
reasonable
to
promote
or
assist
that
industry
,
in
the
way
of
their
calling
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
my
dear
father
,
I
apprehend
,
that
our
honour
benefactor
would
be
under
some
difficulty
,
from
his
natural
politeness
,
and
regard
for
you
and
me

<EOS>
You
see
how
kindly
,
on
all
occasion
,
he
treat
you
both
,
not
only
as
the
parent
of
his
Pamela
,
but
as
if
you
be
his
own
;
and
if
you
have
any
body
as
your
servant
there
,
who
call
you
cousin
,
or
grandfather
,
or
uncle
,
he
would
not
care
,
when
he
come
down
,
to
treat
them
on
the
foot
of
common
servant
,
though
they
may
think
themselves
honour
(
as
they
would
be
,
and
as
I
shall
always
think
myself
)
with
his
command
.
<EOS>
and
would
it
not
,
if
they
be
modest
and
worthy
,
be
as
great
a
difficulty
upon
them
,
to
be
thus
distinguish
,
as
it
would
be
to
him
and
to
me
,
for
his
sake
?
<EOS>
for
otherwise
(
believe
me
,
I
hope
you
will
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
)
,
I
could
sit
down
and
rejoice
with
the
mean
and
remotest
relation
I
have
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
world
's
eye
,
to
every
body
but
my
good
of
parent
,
I
must
,
if
ever
so
reluctant
to
it
,
appear
in
a
light
that
may
not
give
discredit
to
his
choice
.
  
<EOS>
then
again
,
as
I
hint
,
you
will
be
able
,
without
the
least
injury
to
our
common
benefactor
,
to
do
kind
thing
by
any
of
our
relation
,
when
not
with
you
,
than
you
can
do
,
if
they
live
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
lend
them
a
little
money
to
put
them
in
a
way
,
if
any
thing
offer
that
you
think
will
be
to
their
advantage
.
<EOS>
You
can
fit
out
my
she
-
cousin
to
good
reputable
place
.
<EOS>
the
young
you
can
put
to
school
,
or
,
when
fit
,
to
trade
,
accord
to
their
talent
;
and
so
they
will
be
of
course
in
a
way
to
get
an
honest
and
creditable
livelihood
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
above
all
thing
,
one
would
discourage
such
a
proud
and
ambitious
spirit
in
any
of
them
,
as
should
want
to
raise
itself
by
favour
instead
of
merit
;
and
this
the
rather
,
for
,
undoubtedly
,
there
be
many
more
happy
person
in
low
than
in
high
life
,
take
number
for
number
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
although
four
or
five
year
of
different
life
have
pass
with
me
,
I
have
so
much
pride
and
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
work
for
my
living
with
you
,
if
I
could
but
get
honest
to
you
,
that
it
make
my
confinement
the
more
grievous
,
and
,
if
possible
,
aggravate
the
apprehension
attend
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
beg
of
you
,
not
to
think
these
my
reason
proceed
from
the
bad
motive
of
a
heart
taint
with
pride
on
its
high
condition
.
<EOS>
indeed
there
can
be
no
reason
for
it
,
to
one
who
think
after
this
manner
 
the
great
family
on
earth
have
some
among
them
who
be
unhappy
and
low
in
life
;
and
shall
such
a
one
reproach
me
with
have
twenty
low
relation
,
because
they
have
,
peradventure
,
not
above
five
?
  
<EOS>
let
us
then
,
my
dear
parent
,
endeavour
to
judge
of
one
another
,
as
God
,
at
the
last
day
,
will
judge
of
us
all
:
and
then
the
honest
peasant
will
stand
fairer
in
our
esteem
than
the
guilty
peer
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
shall
be
my
own
rule
 
<EOS>
every
one
who
act
justly
and
honestly
,
I
will
look
upon
as
my
relation
,
whether
so
or
not
;
and
the
more
he
want
my
assistance
,
<EOS>
the
more
entitled
to
it
he
shall
be
,
as
well
as
to
my
esteem
;
while
those
who
deserve
it
not
,
must
expect
only
compassion
from
me
,
and
my
prayer
be
they
my
brother
or
sister
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
have
I
not
be
poor
and
lowly
,
I
may
not
have
think
thus
;
but
if
it
be
a
right
way
of
thinking
,
it
be
a
blessing
that
I
be
so
;
and
that
shall
never
be
matter
of
reproach
to
me
,
which
one
day
will
be
matter
of
justification
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
should
think
it
advisable
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
to
make
such
kind
excuse
to
the
offer
service
of
my
cousin
,
as
your
well
reason
shall
suggest
to
you
;
and
to
do
any
thing
else
for
them
of
more
value
,
as
their
circumstance
may
require
,
or
occasion
offer
to
serve
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
the
employ
and
have
them
about
you
,
will
add
comfort
to
your
life
,
I
give
up
entirely
my
own
opinion
,
and
doubt
not
every
thing
will
be
think
well
of
,
that
you
shall
think
fit
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
I
conclude
with
assure
you
,
that
I
be
,
my
ever
-
dear
parent
,
your
dutiful
and
happy
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
the
copy
of
this
letter
I
will
keep
to
myself
,
till
I
have
your
answer
,
that
you
may
be
under
no
difficulty
how
to
act
in
either
of
the
case
mention
in
it
.
    
<EOS>
my
dearest
daughter
,
  
<EOS>
how
shall
I
do
to
answer
,
as
they
deserve
,
your
two
last
letter
?
<EOS>
sure
no
happy
couple
ever
have
such
a
child
as
we
have
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
vain
to
aim
at
word
like
yours
:
and
equally
in
vain
for
us
to
offer
to
set
forth
the
thankfulness
of
our
heart
,
on
the
kind
office
your
honour
husband
have
give
us
;
for
no
reason
but
to
favour
us
still
more
,
and
to
quiet
our
mind
in
the
notion
of
be
useful
to
him
.
<EOS>
God
grant
I
may
be
able
to
be
so
!
 
<EOS>
happy
<EOS>
shall
I
be
,
if
I
can
!
<EOS>
but
I
see
the
generous
drift
of
his
proposal
;
it
be
only
to
make
me
more
easy
from
the
nature
of
my
employment
,
and
,
in
my
mind
too
,
over
-
load
as
I
may
say
,
with
benefit
;
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
me
more
respected
in
my
new
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
,
I
most
gratefully
accept
of
the
kind
offer
;
and
since
it
will
ease
the
worthy
Mr.
Longman
,
shall
with
still
great
pleasure
do
all
I
can
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
I
shall
want
ability
;
but
I
will
be
just
and
honest
,
however
.
<EOS>
that
,
by
God
's
grace
,
will
be
within
my
own
capacity
;
and
that
,
I
hope
,
I
may
answer
for
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
kind
,
indeed
,
to
put
it
in
my
power
to
do
good
to
those
who
shall
deserve
it
;
and
I
will
take
double
pain
to
find
out
the
true
merit
of
such
as
I
shall
recommend
to
favour
,
and
that
their
circumstance
be
really
such
as
I
shall
represent
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
one
thing
let
me
desire
,
that
I
make
up
my
account
to
Mr.
Longman
,
or
to
his
honour
himself
,
when
he
shall
be
here
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
-
<EOS>
but
it
will
make
me
uneasy
,
if
I
be
to
make
up
my
account
to
you
:
for
so
well
known
be
your
love
to
us
,
that
though
you
would
no
more
do
an
unjust
thing
,
than
,
by
God
's
grace
,
we
should
desire
you
;
yet
this
same
ill
-
willing
world
may
think
it
be
like
make
up
account
to
one
's
self
.
  
<EOS>
do
,
my
dear
child
,
get
me
off
this
difficulty
,
and
I
can
have
no
other
;
for
already
I
be
in
hope
I
have
hit
upon
a
contrivance
to
improve
the
estate
,
and
to
better
the
condition
of
the
tenant
,
at
least
not
to
worst
them
,
and
which
,
I
hope
,
will
please
every
body
;
but
I
will
acquaint
Mr.
Longman
with
this
,
and
take
his
advice
;
for
I
will
not
be
too
troublesome
either
to
you
,
my
dear
child
,
or
to
your
spouse
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
act
so
for
his
interest
,
as
not
to
be
a
burden
,
what
happy
creature
should
we
both
be
in
our
own
mind
!
 
<EOS>
We
find
ourselves
more
and
more
respected
by
every
one
;
and
so
far
as
shall
be
consistent
with
our
new
trust
,
we
will
endeavour
to
deserve
it
,
that
we
may
interest
as
many
as
know
us
in
our
own
good
wish
and
prayer
for
the
happiness
of
you
both
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
me
say
,
how
much
convinced
I
be
by
your
reason
for
not
take
to
us
any
of
our
relation
.
<EOS>
every
one
of
those
reason
have
its
force
with
us
.
<EOS>
how
happy
be
we
to
have
so
prudent
a
daughter
to
advise
with
!
<EOS>
and
I
think
myself
oblige
to
promise
this
,
that
whatever
I
do
for
any
of
them
above
the
amount
of
 
forty
shilling
at
one
time
,
I
will
take
your
direction
in
it
,
that
your
wise
hint
,
of
make
every
one
continue
their
industry
,
and
not
to
rely
upon
favour
instead
of
merit
,
may
be
follow
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
this
be
the
way
to
make
them
happy
as
well
as
well
man
and
woman
;
for
,
as
I
have
often
think
,
if
one
be
to
have
a
hundred
pound
a
year
,
it
would
not
do
without
industry
;
and
with
it
,
one
may
do
with
a
quarter
of
it
,
and
less
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
dear
child
,
your
reason
be
so
good
,
that
I
wonder
they
come
not
into
my
head
before
,
and
then
I
need
not
to
have
trouble
you
about
the
matter
:
but
yet
it
run
in
my
own
thought
,
that
I
could
not
like
to
be
an
encroacher
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
hate
a
dirty
thing
;
and
,
in
the
midst
of
my
distress
,
never
could
be
guilty
of
one
.
<EOS>
thank
God
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
rejoice
our
heart
beyond
expression
at
the
hope
you
give
us
of
receive
letter
from
you
now
-
and
<EOS>
-
then
:
it
will
be
the
chief
comfort
of
our
life
,
next
to
see
you
,
as
we
expect
we
sometimes
shall
.
<EOS>
but
yet
,
my
dear
child
,
do
not
let
us
inconvenience
you
neither
.
<EOS>
pray
do
not
;
you
will
have
enough
upon
your
hand
without
 
to
be
sure
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
the
workman
have
make
a
good
progress
,
and
wish
for
Mr.
Longman
to
come
down
;
as
we
also
do
.
  
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
we
should
think
you
proud
,
or
lift
up
with
your
condition
.
<EOS>
You
have
weather
the
first
danger
,
and
but
for
your
fine
clothe
and
jewel
,
we
should
not
see
any
difference
between
our
dear
Pamela
and
the
much
respected
Mrs.
B.
<EOS>
but
God
have
give
you
too
much
sense
to
be
proud
or
lift
up
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
in
your
former
writing
,
a
saying
of
your
"
squire
's
,
speak
of
you
,
that
it
be
for
person
not
use
to
praise
,
and
who
do
not
deserve
it
,
to
be
proud
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
every
day
bring
us
instance
of
the
good
name
his
honour
and
you
,
my
dear
child
,
have
leave
behind
you
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
here
come
one
,
and
then
another
,
and
a
third
,
and
a
fourth
;
  
"
Goodman
Andrews
,
"
cry
one
,
and
,
"
Goody
Andrews
,
"
cry
another
(
and
some
call
us
Mr.
and
Mrs.
,
but
we
like
the
other
full
as
well
)
"
when
hear
you
from
his
honour
?
<EOS>
how
do
his
lady
do
?
 
<EOS>
what
a
charming
couple
be
they
!
 
<EOS>
how
lovingly
do
they
live
!
 
<EOS>
what
an
example
do
they
give
to
all
about
them
!
"
<EOS>
then
one
cry
,
"
God
bless
them
both
,
"
and
another
cry
,
"
amen
;
"
and
so
say
a
third
and
a
fourth
;
and
all
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
when
do
you
expect
them
down
again
?
 
<EOS>
such
-
a
-
one
long
to
see
'em
 
and
will
ride
a
day
's
journey
,
to
have
but
a
sight
of
'em
at
church
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
they
say
,
"
how
this
gentleman
praise
them
,
and
that
lady
admire
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
o
what
a
happiness
be
this
!
<EOS>
how
do
your
poor
mother
<EOS>
and
I
stand
fix
to
the
earth
to
hear
both
your
praise
,
our
tear
trickle
down
our
cheek
,
and
our
heart
heave
as
if
they
would
burst
with
joy
,
till
we
be
force
to
take
leave
in
half
word
,
and
hand
-
in
-
hand
go
in
together
to
bless
God
,
and
bless
you
both
.
<EOS>
o
my
daughter
,
what
a
happy
couple
have
God
and
you
make
us
!
  
<EOS>
Your
poor
mother
be
very
anxious
about
her
dear
child
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
touch
upon
a
matter
so
very
irksome
to
you
to
hear
of
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
the
time
may
be
some
month
off
,
she
every
hour
pray
for
your
safety
and
happiness
,
and
all
the
increase
of
felicity
that
his
honour
's
generous
heart
can
wish
for
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
we
will
say
at
present
;
only
,
that
we
be
,
with
continued
prayer
and
blessing
,
my
dear
child
,
your
love
father
and
mother
,
  
J.
and
E.
ANDREWS

<EOS>
from

We

hundred
time
,
as
we
read
,
that
we
may
have
love
,
and
kiss
,
and
thank
you
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
all
,
my
brother
,
generous
and
noble
as
he
seem
,
when
your
trial
be
over
,
be
a
strange
wicked
young
fellow
;
and
happy
it
be
for
you
both
,
that
he
be
so
cleverly
catch
in
the
trap
he
have
lay
for
your
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
,
my
lord
long
to
see
you
,
and
will
accompany
me
;
for
,
he
say
,
he
have
but
a
faint
idea
of
your
person
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
and
them
all
,
that
you
be
the
fine
girl
,
and
the
most
improved
in
person
and
mind
,
I
ever
beheld
;
and
I
be
not
afraid
although
they
should
imagine
all
they
can
in
your
favour
,
from
my
account
,
that
they
will
be
disappoint
when
they
see
and
converse
with
you
.
<EOS>
but
one
thing
more
you
must
do
,
and
then
we
will
love
you
still
more
;
and
that
is
,
send
us
the
rest
of
your
paper
,
down
to
your
marriage
at
least
;
and
farther
,
it
you
have
write
farther
;
for
we
all
long
to
see
the
rest
,
as
you
relate
it
,
though
we
know
in
general
what
have
pass
.
  
<EOS>
You
leave
off
with
an
account
of
an
angry
letter
I
write
to
my
brother
,
to
persuade
him
to
give
you
your
liberty
,
and
a
sum
of
money
;
not
doubt
but
his
design
would
end
in
your
ruin
,
and
,
I
own
,
not
wish
he
would
marry
you
;
for
little
do
I
know
of
your
merit
and
excellence
,
nor
could
I
,
but
for
your
letter
so
lately
send
me
,
have
have
any
notion
of
either
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
question
,
but
if
you
have
recite
my
passionate
behaviour
to
you
,
when
at
the
hall
,
I
shall
make
a
ridiculous
figure
enough
;
but
I
will
forgive
all
that
,
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasure
you
have
give
me
,
and
will
still
farther
give
me
,
if
you
comply
with
my
request
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
say
,
it
be
the
good
story
she
have
hear
,
and
the
most
instructive
;
and
she
long
to
have
the
conclusion
of
it
in
your
own
word
.
<EOS>
She
say
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
what
a
hopeful
brother
you
have
,
Lady
Davers
!
<EOS>
o
these
intriguing
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
what
roguery
do
they
not
commit
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
have
a
fine
husband
of
him
,
have
I
receive
your
proposal
!
<EOS>
the
dear
Pamela
would
have
run
in
his
head
,
and
have
I
be
the
first
lady
in
the
kingdom
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
stand
but
a
poor
chance
in
his
esteem
;
for
,
you
see
,
his
design
upon
her
begin
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
say
,
you
have
a
good
heart
to
go
back
again
to
him
,
when
the
violent
wretch
have
drive
you
from
him
on
such
a
slight
occasion
:
<EOS>
but
yet
,
she
think
the
reason
you
give
in
your
relation
,
and
your
love
for
him
(
which
then
you
begin
to
discover
be
your
case
)
,
as
well
as
the
event
,
shew
you
do
right
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
will
tell
you
all
our
judgment
,
when
we
have
read
the
rest
of
your
account
.
<EOS>
so
pray
send
them
as
soon
as
you
can

My
good
dear
Lady
,
  
You
have
do
me
great
honour
in
the
letter
your
ladyship
have
be
please
to
send
me
;
and
it
be
a
high
pleasure
to
me
,
now
all
be
so
happily
over
,
that
my
poor
paper
in
the
least
divert
you
,
and
such
honourable
and
worthy
person
as
your
ladyship
mention
.
<EOS>
I
could
wish
I
may
be
favour
with
such
remark
on
my
conduct
,
so
nakedly
set
forth
(
without
any
imagination
that
they
would
ever
appear
in
such
an
assembly
)
,
as
may
be
of
use
to
me
in
my
future
life
,
and
thus
make
me
more
worthy
than
it
be
otherwise
possible
<EOS>
I
can
be
,
of
the
honour
to
which
I
be
raise
.
<EOS>
do
,
dearest
lady
,
favour
me
so
far
.
<EOS>
I
be
prepared
to
receive
blame
,
and
to
benefit
by
it
,
and
can
not
expect
praise
so
much
from
my
action
as
from
my
intention
;
for
indeed
,
these
be
always
just
and
honourable
:
but
why
,
even
for
these
do
I
talk
of
praise
,
since
,
be
prompt
by
impulse
I
could
not
resist
,
it
can
be
no
merit
in
me
to
have
be
govern
by
them
?
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
paper
follow
those
in
your
hand
,
when
I
say
,
that
they
must
needs
appear
impertinent
to
such
judge
,
after
what
you
know
,
I
dare
say
,
your
ladyship
will
not
insist
upon
them
:
yet
I
will
not
scruple
briefly
to
mention
what
they
contain
.
  
<EOS>
all
my
danger
and
trial
be
happily
at
an
end
:
so
that
they
only
contain
the
conversation
that
pass
between
your
ladyship
's
generous
brother
and
me
;
his
kind
assurance
of
honourable
love
to
me
;
my
acknowledgment
of
unworthiness
to
him
;
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
respectful
change
of
behaviour
towards
me
;
Mr.
B.
's
reconciliation
to
Mr.
Williams
;
his

me
to
the
good
family
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
avow
before
them
his
honourable
intention
.
<EOS>
a
visit
from
my
honest
father
,
who
(
not
know
what
to
conclude
from
my
letter
to
him
before
I
return
to
your
honour
brother
,
desire
my
paper
from
him
)
come
in
great
anxiety
of
heart
to
know
the
bad
,
doubt
I
have
at
last
be
catch
by
a
stratagem
,
end
in
my
ruin
.
<EOS>
His
joyful
surprise
to
find
how
happy
I
be
likely
to
be
.
<EOS>
all
the
hope
give
me
,
answer
by
the
private
celebration
of
our
nuptial
 
an
honour
so
much
above
all
that
my
utmost
ambition
could
make
me
aspire
to
,
and
which
I
never
can
deserve
!
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
arrival
,
and
anger
,
not
know
<EOS>
I
be
actually
married
,
but
suppose
me
a
vile
wicked
creature
;
in
which
case
I
should
have
deserve
the
bad
of
usage
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
's
angry
lesson
to
me
,
for
dare
to
interfere
;
though
I
think
in
the
tender
and
most
dutiful
manner
,
between
your
ladyship
and
himself
.
<EOS>
the
most
acceptable
goodness
and
favour
of
your
ladyship
afterwards
to
me
,
of
which
,
as
become
me
,
I
shall
ever
retain
the
most
grateful
sense
.
<EOS>
My
return
to
this
sweet
mansion
in
a
manner
so
different
from
my
quitting
it
,
where
I
have
be
so
happy
for
four
year
,
in

my
duty
to
the

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
Mr.

and

the
pretty

<EOS>
Our
appearance
at
church
;
the
favour
of
the
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
,
know
your
ladyship
have
not
disdain
to
look
upon
me
,
and
to
be
favourable
to
me
,
come
the
more
readily
into
a
neighbourly
intimacy
with
me
,
and
still
so
much
the
more
readily
,
as
the
continue
kindness
of
my
dear
benefactor
,
and
his
condescending
deportment
to
me
before
them
(
as
if
I
have
be
worthy
of
the
honour
do
me
)
,
do
credit
to
his
own
generous
act

<EOS>
these
,
my
lady
,
down
to
my
good
parent
set
out
to
this
place
,
in
order
to
be
settle
,
by
my
honoured
benefactor
's
bounty
,
in
the
kentish
farm
,
be
the
most
material
content
of
my
remain
paper
:
and
though
they
may
be
the
most
agreeable
to
those
for
whom
only
they
be
write
,
yet
,
as
they
be
principally
matter
of
course
,
after
what
your
ladyship
have
with
you
;
as
the
joy
of
my
fond
heart
can
be
better
judge
of
by
your
ladyship
than
describe
by
me
;
and
as
you
be
acquaint
with
all
the
particular
that
can
be
worthy
of
any
other
person
's
notice
but
<EOS>
my
dear
parent
:
I
be
sure
your
ladyship
will
dispense
with
your
command
;
and
I
make
it
my
humble
request
that
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
Madam
<EOS>
,
you
must
needs
think
,
that
when
my
doubt
be
dispel
;
when
confident
all
my
trial
be
over
;
when
I
have
a
prospect
of
be
so
abundantly
reward
for
what
I
suffer
:
when
every
hour
rise
upon
me
with
new
delight
,
and
fraught
with
fresh
instance
of
generous
kindness
from
such
a
dear
gentleman
,
my
master
,
my
benefactor
,
the
son
of
my
honoured
lady
:
your
ladyship
must
needs
<EOS>
think
,
I
say
,
that
I
must
be
too
much
affected
,
my
heart
too
much
open
;
and
especially
as
it
then
(
relieve
from
its
past
anxiety
and
fear
,
which
have
keep
down
and
damp
the
latent
flame
)
<EOS>
first
discover
impression
of
which
before
I
hardly
think
it
susceptible
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
it
be
scarce
possible
,
that
my
joy
and
my
prudence
,
if
I
be
to
be
try
by
such
judge
of
delicacy
and
decorum
as
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
the
honour
countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
could
be
so
intimately
,
so
laudably
couple
,
as
be
to
be
wish
:
although
the
continued
sense
of
my
unworthiness
,
and
the
disgrace
the
dear
gentleman
would
bring
upon
himself
by
his
generous
goodness
to
me
,
always
go
hand
in
hand
with
my
joy
and
my
prudence
;
and
what
these
consideration
take
from
the
former
,
be
add
to
the
latter
,
keep
me
steady
and
more
equal
to
myself
,
than
otherwise
it
be
possible
such
a
young
creature
as
I
could
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
wherefore
my
good
lady
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
stand
excused
,
and
shall
not
bring
upon
myself
the
censure
of
be
disobedient
to
your
command
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
Madam
,
since
you
inform
me
that
my
good
Lord
Davers
will
attend
you
hither
,
I
should
never
dare
to
look
his
lordship
in
the
face
,
if
all
the
emotion
of
my
heart
,
on
such
affect
occasion
,
stand
confess
to
his
lordship
;
and
if
I
be
ashamed
they
should
to
your
ladyship
,
to
the
countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
whose
goodness
must
induce
you
all
three
to
think
favourably
,
in
such
circumstance
,
of
one
who
be
of
your
own
sex
,
how
would
it
concern
me
,
for
the
same
to
appear
before
such
gentleman
as
my
lord
and
his
nephew
?
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
could
not
look
up
to
either
of
them
in
the
sense
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
and
give
me
leave
to
hope
,
that
some
of
the
scene
,
in
the
letter
your
ladyship
have
,
be
not
read
to
gentleman
;
your
ladyship
must
needs
know
which
I
mean
,
and
will
think
of
my
two
grand
trial
of
all
.
<EOS>
for
though
I
be
the
innocent
subject
of
wicked
attempt
,
and
so
can
not
,
I
hope
,
suffer
in
any
one
's
opinion
for
what
I
could
not
help
;
yet
,
for
your
dear
brother
's
sake
,
as
well
as
for
the
decency
of
the
matter
,
one
would
not
,
when
have
the
honour
to
appear
before
my
lord
and
his
nephew
,
he
look
upon
,
methink
,
with
that
levity
of
eye
and
think
,
which
,
perhaps
,
hard
-
hearted
gentleman
may
pass
upon
one
,
by
reason
of
those
very
scene
,
which
would
move
pity
and
concern
in
a
good
lady
's
breast
,
for
a
poor
creature
so
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
my
dear
lady
,
be
pleased
to
tell
me
,
if
the
gentleman
have
hear
all
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
 
and
also
to
point
out
to
me
such
part
of
my
conduct
as
deserve
blame
:
indeed
,
I
will
try
to
make
a
good
use
of
your
censure
,
and
be
sure
I
shall
be
thankful
for
it
;
for
it
will
make
me
hope
to
be
more
and
more
worthy
of
the
honour
I
have
,
of
be
exalt
into
such
a
distinguished
family
,
and
the
right
the
good
of
gentleman
have
give
me
to
style
myself
your
ladyship
's
most
humble
,
and
most
oblige
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
from
Lady
Davers
,
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
pamela
,
  
You
have
give
us
all
a
great
disappointment
in
decline
to
oblige
me
with
the
sequel
of
your
paper
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
out
of
humour
with
you
at
first
;
 
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
be
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
bear
denial
,
when
my
heart
be
set
upon
any
thing
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Betty
become
your
advocate
,
and
say
,
she
think
you
very
excusable
:
since
,
no
doubt
,
there
may
be
many
tender
thing
,
circumstance
as
you
be
,
well
enough
for
your
parent
to
see
,
but
for
nobody
else
;
and
relation
of
our
side
,
the
least
of
all
,
whose
future
intimacy
,
and
frequent
visit
,
may
give
occasion
for
raillery
and
remark
,
not
otherwise
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
regard
her
apology
for
you
the
more
,
because
I
know
it
be
a
great
baulk
to
her
,
that
you
do
not
comply
with
my
request
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
child
,
when
you
know
me
more
,
you
will
find
,
that
if
I
be
oblige
to
give
up
one
point
,
I
always
insist
on
another
,
as
near
it
as
I
can
,
in
order
to
see
if
it
be
only
one
thing
I
be
to
be
refuse
,
or
every
thing
;
in
which
last
case
,
I
know
how
to
take
my
measure
,
and
resent
.
  
<EOS>
now
this
be
what
I
insist
upon
;
that
you
correspond
with
me
the
same
as
you
do
with
your
parent
,
and
acquaint
me
with
every
passage
that
be
of
concern
to
you
;
begin
with
your
account
how
both
of
you
spend
your
time
when
in
Kent
;
for
you
must
know
we
be
all
take
with
your
duty
to
your
parent
,
and
the
discretion
of
the
good
couple
,
and
think
you
have
give
a
very
edifying
example
of
filial
piety
to
all
who
shall
hear
your
story
;
for
if
so
much
duty
be
owe
to
parent
,
where
nothing
can
be
do
for
one
,
how
much
more
be
it
to
be
expect
,
where
there
be
power
to
add
to
the
natural
obligation
,
all
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
life
?
<EOS>
We
people
in
upper
life
love
to
hear
how
gratitude
and
unexpected
benefit
operate
upon
honest
mind
,
who
have
little
more
than
plain
artless
nature
for
their
guide
;
and
we
flatter
ourselves
with
the
hope
of
many
a
delightful
hour
,
by
your
mean
,
in
this
our
solitary
situation
,
if
oblige
to
pass
the
next
winter
in
it
,
as
my
lord
and
the
earl
threaten
me
,
and
the
countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
that
we
shall
.
<EOS>
then
let
us
hear
of
every
thing
that
give
you
joy
or
trouble
:
and
if
my
brother
carry
you
to
town
,
for
the
winter
,
while
he
attend
parliament
,
the
advice
you
can
give
us
of
what
pass
in
London
,
and
of
the
public
entertainment
and
diversion
he
will
take
you
to
,
relate
in
your
own
artless
and
natural
observation
,
will
be
as
divert
to
us
,
as
if
at
them
ourselves
.
<EOS>
for
a
young
creature
of
your
good
understanding
,
to
whom
all
these
thing
will
be
quite
new
,
will
give
us
,
perhaps
,
a
well
taste
of
them
,
their
beauty
and
defect
,
than
we
may
have
before
;
for
we
people
of
quality
go
to
those
place
,
dress
out
and
adorn
in
such
a
manner
,
outvye
one
another
,
as
if
we
consider
ourselves
as
so
many
part
of
the
public
entertainment
,
and
be
too
much
pleased
with
ourselves
to
be
able
so
to
attend
to
what
we
see
,
as
to
form
a
right
judgment
of
it
;
but
some
of
us
behave
with
so
much
indifference
to
the
entertainment
,
as
if
we
think
ourselves
above
be
divert
by
what
we
come
to
see
,
and
as
if
our
view
be
rather
to
trifle
away
our
time
,
than
improve
ourselves
by
attend
to
the
story
of
the
action
.
  
<EOS>
see
,
Pamela
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
make
an
unworthy
correspondent
altogether
,
for
I
can
get
into
thy
grave
way
,
and
moralize
a
little
now
<EOS>
and
then
:
and
if
you
will
promise
to
oblige
me
by
your
constant
correspondence
in
this
way
,
and
div
yourself
of
all
restraint
,
as
if
you
be
write
to
your
parent
(
and
I
can
tell
you
,
you
will
write
to
one
who
will
be
as
candid
and
as
favourable
to
you
as
they
can
be
)
,
then
I
be
sure
we
shall
have
truth
and
nature
from
you
;
and
these
be
thing
which
we
be
generally
so
much
lift
above
,
by
our
condition
,
that
we
hardly
know
what
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
have
write
enough
for
one
letter
;
and
yet
,
have
more
to
say
,
I
will
,
after
this
,
send
another
,
without
wait
for
your
answer
,
which
you
may
give
to
both
together
;
and
be

yours

<EOS>
dear
PAMELA
,
  
I
be
very
glad
thy
honest
man
have
let
thee
into
the
affair
of
Sally
Godfrey
.
<EOS>
but
pr'ythee
,
Pamela
,
tell
us
how
he
do
it
,
and
thy
thought
upon
it
,
for
that
be
a
critical
case
,
and
as
he
have
represent
it
,
so
shall
I
know
what
to
say
of
it
before
you
and
him
:
for
I
would
not
make
mischief
between
you
for
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
let
me
tell
you
,
will
be
a
try
part
of
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
for
he
love
the
child
,
and
will
judge
of
you
by
your
conduct
towards
it
.
<EOS>
He
dearly
love
her
mother
;
and
notwithstanding
her
fault
,
she
well
deserve
it
:
for
she
be
a
sensible
,
ay
,
and
a
modest
lady
,
and
of
an
ancient
and
genteel
family
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
heir
to
a
noble
estate
,
be
of
a
bold
and
enterprising
spirit
,
fond
of
intrigue
 
<EOS>
do
not
let
this
concern
you
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
the
great
happiness
,
and
merit
too
,
if
you
can
hold
him
;
and
,
'
tis
my
opinion
,
if
any
body
can
,
you
will
.
<EOS>
then
he
do
not
like
the
young
lady
's
mother
,
who
seek
artfully
to
entrap
him
.
<EOS>
so
that
the
poor
girl
,
divide
between
her
inclination
for
him
,
and
her
duty
to
her
design
mother
,
give
into
the
plot
upon
him
:
and
he
think
himself
 
vile
wretch
as
he
be
for
all
that
!
 
<EOS>
at
liberty
to
set
up
plot
against
plot
,
and
the
poor
lady
's
honour
be
the
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
speak
well
of
her
to
him
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
receive
the
child
kindly
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
presence
of
mind
to
do
this
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
a
nice
part
to
act
;
and
all
his
observation
be
up
,
I
dare
say
,
on
the
occasion
 
<EOS>
do
let
me
hear
how
it
be
.
<EOS>
and
write
without
restraint
;
for
although
I
be
not
your
mother
,
yet
be
I
his
eld
sister
,
you
know
,
and
as
such
 
come
,
I
will
say
so
,
in
hope
you
will
oblige
me
 
your
sister
,
and
so
entitled
to
expect
a
compliance
with
my
request
:
for
be
there
not
a
duty
,
in
degree
,
to
elder
sister
from
young
?
  
<EOS>
as
to
our
remark
upon
your
behaviour
,
they
have
be
much
to
your
credit
:
but
nevertheless
,
I
will
,
to
encourage
you
to
enter
into
this
request
correspondence
with
me
,
consult
Lady
Betty
,
and
will
go
over
your
paper
again
,
and
try
to
find
fault
with
your
conduct
,
and
if
we
see
any
thing
censurable
,
will
freely
let
you
know
our
mind
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
before
-
hand
,
I
can
tell
you
,
we
shall
be
agree
in
one
opinion
;
and
that
is
,
that
we
know
not
who
would
have
act
as
you
have
do
,
upon
the
whole
.
<EOS>
so
,
Pamela
,
you
see
I
put
myself
upon
the
same
foot
of
correspondence
with
you
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
will
promise
to
answer
every
latter
:
<EOS>
no
,
you
must
not
expect
that
.
<EOS>
Your
part
will
be
a
kind
of
narrative
,
purposely
design
to
entertain
us
here
;
and
I
hope
to
receive
six
,
seven
,
eight
,
or
ten
letter
,
as
it
may
happen
,
before
I
return
one
:
but
such
a
part
I
will
bear
in
it
,
as
shall
let
you
know
our
opinion
of
your
proceeding
,
and
relation
of
thing
.
<EOS>
and
as
you
wish
to
be
find
fault
with
,
you
shall
freely
have
it
(
though
not
in
a
splenetic
or
ill
-
natured
way
)
,
as
often
as
you
give
occasion
.
<EOS>
now
,
Pamela
,
I
have
two
view
in
this
.
<EOS>
one
be
to
see
how
a
man
of
my
brother
's
spirit
,
who
have
not
deny
himself
any
genteel
liberty
(
for
it
must
be
own
he
never
be
a
common
town
rake
,
and
have
always
a
dignity
in
his
roguery
)
,
will
behave
himself
to
you
,
and
in
wedlock
,
which
use
to
be
freely
sneer
at
by
him
;
the
next
,
that
I
may
love
you
more
and
more
as
by
your
letter
,
I
shall
be
more
and
more
acquainted
with
you
,
as
well
as
by
conversation
;
so
that
you
can
not
be
off
,
if
you
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
however
,
you
will
have
one
objection
to
this
;
and
that
is
,
that
your
family
affair
will
require
your
attention
,
and
not
give
the
time
you
use
to
have
for
this
employment
.
<EOS>
but
consider
,
child
,
the
station
you
be
raise
to
do
not
require
you
to
be
quite
a
domestic
animal
.
<EOS>
You
be
lift
up
to
the
rank
of
a
lady
,
and
you
must
act
up
to
it
,
and
not
think
of
set
such
an
example
,
as
will
draw
upon
you
the
ill
-
will
and
censure
of
other
lady
.
<EOS>
for
will
any
of
our
sex
visit
one
who
be
continually
employ
herself
in
such
work
as
either
must
be
a
reproach
to
herself
,
or
to
them
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
order
.
<EOS>
You
will
consider
yourself
as
the
task
-
mistress
,
and
the
common
herd
of
female
servant
as
so
many
negro
direct
themselves
by
your
nod
;
or
yourself
as
the
master
-
wheel
,
in
some
beautiful
piece
of
mechanism
,
whose
dignified
grave
motion
be
to
set
a
-
go
all
the
under
-
wheel
,
with
a
velocity
suitable
to
their
respective
part
.
<EOS>
let
your
servant
,
under
your
direction
,
do
all
that
relate
to
household
management
;
they
can
not
write
to
entertain
and
instruct
as
you
can
:
so
what
will
you
have
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
my
own
question
:
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
endeavour
to
please
your
sovereign
lord
and
master
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
any
other
woman
in
England
,
be
her
quality
ever
so
high
,
would
have
find
enough
to
do
to
succeed
in
that
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
to
receive
and
pay
visit
,
in
order
,
for
his
credit
as
well
as
your
own
,
to
make
your
fashionable
neighbour
fond
of
you
.
<EOS>
then
,
thirdly
,
you
will
have
time
upon
your
hand
(
as
your
monarch
himself
rise
early
,
and
be
tolerably
regular
for
such
a
brazen
face
as
he
have
be
)
to
write
to
me
in
the
manner
I
have
mention
,
and
expect
;
and
I
see
plainly
,
by
your
style
,
nothing
can
be
easy
for
you
than
to
do
this
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
and
with
reading
,
may
your
time
be
fill
up
with
reputation
to
yourself
,
and
delight
to
other
,
till
a
fourth
employment
put
itself
upon
you
:
and
that
be
(
shall
I
tell
you
boy
,
[

line

to

from

or

it

,
my

<EOS>
,
Pamela
 
will
want
one
apology
for
his
conduct
,
be
as
excellent
as
you
may
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
this
,
child
,
not
to
reflect
upon
you
,
since
the
thing
be
do
;
for
I
love
you
dearly
,
and
will
love
you
more
and
more
 
but
to
let
you
know
what
be
expect
from
you
,
and
encourage
you
in
the
prospect
already
open
to
you
both
,
and
to
me
,
who
have
the
welfare
of
the
family
I
spring
from
so
much
at
heart
,
although
I
know
this
will
be
attend
with
some
anxiety
to
a
mind
so
thoughtful
and
apprehensive
as
yours
seem
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
but
this
put
me
in
mind
of
your
solicitude
,
lest
the
gentleman
should
have
see
every
thing
contain
in
your
letter
-
<EOS>
but
this
I
will
particularly
speak
to
in
a
third
letter
,
have
fill
my
paper
on
all
side
:
and
be
,
till
then
,
yours
,

c.
  
B.
DAVERS
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
and
I
hope
will
take
it
as
a
favour
,
that
I
break
the
ice
,
and
begin
first
in
the
indispensably
expect
correspondence
between
us
.
    
<EOS>
from
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
Pamela
,
you
be
solicitous
to
know
,
if
the
gentleman
have
see
every
part
of
your
paper
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
<EOS>
but
they
have
:
<EOS>
nor
,
except
in
regard
to
the
reputation
of
your
saucy
man
,
do
I
see
why
the
part
you
hint
at
may
not
be
read
by
those
to
whom
the
rest
may
be
shew
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
,
Lady
Betty
,
who
be
a
very
nice
and
delicate
lady
,
have
no
objection
to
any
part
,
though
read
before
man
:
only
now
and
then
cry
out
,
"
o
the
vile
man
!
 
<EOS>
see
,
Lord
Davers
,
<EOS>
what
wretche
you
man
be
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
commiserate
you
,
"
ah
!
the
poor
Pamela
!
"
<EOS>
and
express
her
impatience
to
hear
how
you
escape
at
this
time
,
and
at
that
,
and
rejoice
in
your
escape
.
<EOS>
and
now
-
and
-
then
,
"
o
,
Lady
Davers
,
what
a
vile
brother
you
have
!
 
<EOS>
I
hate
him
perfectly
.
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
can
not
be
make
amend
for
all
this
,
though
he
have
marry
her
.
<EOS>
who
,
that
know
these
thing
of
him
,
would
wish
him
to
be
her
,
with
all
his
advantage
of
person
,
mind
,
and
fortune
?
"
and
his
wicked
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
can
tell
you
this
,
that
except
one
have
hear
every
tittle
of
your
danger
,
how
near
you
be
to
ruin
,
and
how
little
he
stand
upon
take
any
measure
to
effect
his
vile
purpose
,
even
daring
to
attempt
you
in
the
presence
of
a
good
woman
,
which
be
a
wickedness
that
every
wicked
man
could
not
be
guilty
of
;
I
say
,
except
one
have
know
these
thing
,
one
could
not
have
judge
of
the
merit
of
your
resistance
,
and
how
shocking
those
attempt
be
to
your
virtue
,
for
that
life
itself
be
endanger
by
them
:
nor
,
let
me
tell
you
,
could
I
,
in
particular
,
have
so
well
justified
him
for
marry
you
(
I
mean
with
respect
to
his
own
proud
and
haughty
temper
of
mind
)
,
if
there
have
be
room
to
think
he
could
have
have
you
upon
easy
term
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
,
child
,
on
twenty
account
,
that
we
,
your
and
his
well
-
wisher
and
his
relation
,
should
know
that
he
have
try
every
stratagem
to
subdue
you
to
his
purpose
,
before
he
marry
you
:
and
how
would
it
have
answer
to
his
intrepid
character
,
and
pride
of
heart
,
have
we
not
be
particularly
lead
into
the
nature
of
those
attempt
,
which
you
so
nobly
resist
,
as
to
convince
us
all
,
that
you
have
deserve
the
good
fortune
you
have
meet
with
,
as
well
as
all
the
kind
and
respectful
treatment
he
can
possibly
shew
you
?
  
<EOS>
nor
ought
you
to
be
concern
who
see
any
the
most
tender
part
of
your
story
,
except
,
as
I
say
,
for
his
sake
;
for
it
must
be
a
very
unvirtuous
mind
that
can
form
any
other
idea
from
what
you
relate
than
those
of
terror
and
pity
for
you
.
<EOS>
Your
expression
be
too
delicate
to
give
the
nice
ear
offence
,
except
at
him
.
<EOS>
You
paint
no
scene
but
such
as
make
his
wickedness
odious
:
and
that
gentleman
,
much
more
lady
,
must
have
a
very
corrupt
heart
,
who
could
from
such
circumstance
of
distress
,
make
any
reflection
,
but
what
should
be
to
your
honour
,
and
in
abhorrence
of
such
action
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
convinced
of
this
,
that
by
this
rule
I
would
judge
of
any
man
's
heart
in
the
world
,
well
than
by
a
thousand
declaration
and
protestation
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
,
rakish
as
Jackey
be
,
and
freely
as
I
doubt
not
that
Lord
Davers
have
formerly
live
<EOS>
(
for
he
have
be
a
man
of
pleasure
)
,
they
give
me
,
by
their
behaviour
on
these
tender
occasion
,
reason
to
think
they
have
more
virtue
than
not
to
be
very
apprehensive
for
your
safety
;
and
my
lord
often
exclaim
,
that
he
could
not
have
think
his
brother
such
a
libertine
,
neither
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
child
,
be
not
these
thing
write
in
confidence
have
not
recite
all
you
could
recite
,
would
there
not
have
be
room
for
any
one
,
who
see
what
you
write
,
to
imagine
they
have
be
still
bad
?
<EOS>
and
how
could
the
terror
be
suppose
to
have
have
such
effect
upon
you
,
as
to
endanger
your
life
,
without
imagine
you
<EOS>
have
undergo
the
bad
a
vile
man
could
offer
,
unless
you
have
tell
us
what
that
be
which
he
do
offer
,
and
so
put
a
bind
,
as
it
be
,
to
one
's
fear
of
what
you
suffer
,
which
otherwise
must
have
be
injurious
to
your
purity
,
though
you
could
not
help
it
?
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
Pamela
,
it
be
but
do
justice
to
the
libertine
himself
to
tell
your
mother
the
whole
truth
,
<EOS>
that
she
may
know
he
be
not
so
very
abandon
,
but
he
could
stop
short
of
the
execution
of
his
wicked
purpose
,
which
he
apprehend
,
if
pursue
,
would
destroy
the
life
,
that
,
of
all
life
,
he
would
choose
to
preserve
;
and
you
owe
also
thus
much
to
your
parent
'
peace
of
mind
,
that
,
after
all
their
distracting
fear
for
you
,
they
may
see
they
have
reason
to
rejoice
in
an
uncontaminated
daughter
.
<EOS>
and
one
can
not
but
reflect
,
now
he
have
make
you
his
wife
,
that
it
must
be
satisfaction
to
the
wicked
man
,
as
well
as
to
yourself
,
that
he
be
not
more
guilty
than
he
be
,
nor
take
more
liberty
than
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
must
say
,
that
I
could
not
have
account
for
your
fit
,
by
any
description
short
of
those
you
give
;
and
have
you
be
less
particular
in
the
circumstance
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
judge
he
have
be
still
bad
,
and
<EOS>
your
person
,
though
not
your
mind
,
less
pure
,
than
his
pride
would
expect
from
the
woman
he
should
marry
;
for
this
be
the
case
of
all
rake
,
that
though
they
indulge
in
all
manner
of
libertinism
themselves
,
there
be
no
class
of
man
who
exact
great
delicacy
from
the
person
they
marry
,
though
they
care
not
how
bad
they
make
the
wife
,
the
sister
,
and
daughter
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
(
and
send
all
my
three
letter
together
)
,
that
we
all
blame
you
in
some
degree
for
bear
the
wicked
Jewkes
in
your
sight
,
after
her
most
impudent
assistance
in
his
lewd
attempt
;
much
less
,
we
think
,
ought
you
to
have
leave
her
in
her
place
,
and
reward
her
;
for
her
vileness
could
hardly
be
equal
by
the
bad
action
of
the
most
abandon
procuress
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
the
difficulty
you
labour
under
,
in
his
arbitrary
will
,
and
intercession
for
her
:
but
Lady
Betty
rightly
observe
,
that
he
know
what
a
vile
woman
<EOS>
she
be
,
when
he
put
you
into
her
power
,
and
no
doubt
employ
her
,
be
sure
she
would
answer
all
his
purpose
:
and
that
therefore
she
should
have
have
very
little
opinion
of
the
sincerity
of
his
reformation
,
while
he
be
so
solicitous
in
keep
her
,
and
have
her
put
upon
a
foot
,
in
the
present
on
your
nuptial
,
with
honest
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
say
,
have
she
be
in
your
case
,
have
have
one
struggle
for
her
dismission
,
let
it
have
be
take
as
it
would
;
and
he
that
be
so
well
pleased
with
your
virtue
,
must
have
think
this
a
natural
consequence
of
it
,
if
he
be
in
earnest
to
reclaim
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
you
shew
him
all
I
write
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
write
this
last
part
in
the
cover
,
as
well
for
want
of
room
,
as
that
you
may
keep
it
from
him
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
though
if
you
think
it
will
serve
any
good
end
,
I
be
not
against
shew
to
him
all
I
write
.
<EOS>
for
I
must
ever
speak
my
mind
,
though
I
be
to
smart
for
it
;
and
that
nobody
can
or
have
the
heart
to
make
me
do
,
but
<EOS>
my
bold
brother
.
<EOS>
so
,
Pamela
,
for
this
time
,
Adieu
.
    
<EOS>
my
good
lady
,
  
<EOS>
I
be
honour
with
your
ladyship
's
three
letter
,
the
content
of
which
be
highly
obliging
to
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
should
be
inexcusable
if
I
do
not
comply
with
your
injunction
,
and
be
very
proud
and
thankful
for
your
ladyship
's
condescension
in
accept
of
my
poor
scribble
,
and
promise
such
a
rich
and
valuable
return
;
of
which
you
have
already
give
such
ample
and
delightful
instance
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
plead
my
defect
,
to
excuse
my
obedience
.
<EOS>
I
only
fear
that
the
awe
which
will
be
always
upon
me
,
when
I
write
to
your
ladyship
,
will
lay
me
under
so
great
a
restraint
,
that
I
shall
fall
short
even
of
the
merit
my
paper
have
already
make
for
me
,
through
your
kind
indulgence
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
shelter
myself
under
your
goodness
,
I
will
cheerfully
comply
with
every
thing
your
ladyship
expect
from
me
,
that
it
be
in
my
power
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
give
me
leave
,
Madam
,
to
put
into
some
little
method
,
the
particular
of
what
you
desire
of
me
,
that
I
may
speak
to
them
all
:
for
,
since
you
be
so
good
as
to
excuse
me
from
send
the
rest
of
my
paper
(
which
indeed
would
not
bear
in
many
place
)
,
I
will
omit
nothing
that
shall
tend
to
convince
you
of
my
readiness
to
obey
you
in
every
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
your
ladyship
would
have
the
particular
of
the
happy
fortnight
we
pass
in
Kent
,
on
one
of
the
most
agreeable
occasion
that
could
befall
me
.
  
<EOS>
secondly
,
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
your
dear
brother
acquaint
me
with
the
affect
story
of
Miss
Godfrey
,
and
my
behaviour
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
thirdly
,
I
presume
your
ladyship
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
expect
me
to
say
something
upon
your
welcome
remark
on
my
conduct
towards
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
particular
your
ladyship
mention
,
will
naturally
fall
under
one
or
other
of
these
three
head
 
but
expect
not
,
my
lady
,
though
I
begin
in
method
thus
,
that
I
shall
keep
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
not
allow
for
me
,
and
keep
in
view
the
poor
Pamela
Andrews
in
all
I
write
,
but
have
Mrs.
B.
in
your
eye
,
what
will
become
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
promise
myself
so
much
improvement
from
this
correspondence
,
that
I
enter
upon
it
with
a
great
delight
than
I
can
express
,
notwithstanding
the
mingle
awe
and
diffidence
that
will
accompany
me
,
in
every
part
of
the
agreeable
task
.
<EOS>
to
begin
with
the
first
article
:
  
<EOS>
Your
dear
brother
and
my
honest
parent
<EOS>
(
I
know
your
ladyship
will
expect
from
me
,
that
on
all
occasion
I
should
speak
of
them
with
the
duty
that
become
a
good
child
)
with
myself
,
set
out
on
the
Monday
morning
for
Kent
,
pass
through
St.
Albans
to
London
,
at
both
which
place
we
stop
a
night
;
for
our
dear
benefactor
would
make
us
take
easy
journey
:
and
on
Wednesday
evening
we
arrive
at
the
sweet
place
allot
for
the
good
couple
.
<EOS>
We
be
attend
only
by
Abraham
and
John
,
on
horseback
:
for
Mr.
Colbrand
,
have
sprain
his
foot
,
be
in
the
travelling
-
coach
,
with
the
cook
,
the
housemaid
,
and
Polly
Barlow
,
a
genteel
new
servant
,
whom
Mrs.
Brooks
recommend
to
wait
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
have
be
there
a
fortnight
,
employ
in
settle
the
term
of
an
additional
purchase
of
this
pretty
well
-
wooded
and
well
-
water
estate
:
and
his
account
of
his
proceeding
be
very
satisfactory
to
his
honoured
principal
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
,
he
have
much
ado
to
dissuade
the
tenant
from
pursue
a
form
resolution
of
meet
their
landlord
on
horseback
,
at
some
mile
distance
;
for
he
have
inform
them
when
he
expect
us
;
but
know
how
desirous
Mr.
B.
be
of
be
retire
,
he
have
venture
to
assure
them
,
that
when
every
thing
be
settle
,
and
the
new
purchase
actually
enter
upon
,
they
would
have
his
presence
among
them
often
;
and
that
he
would
introduce
them
all
at
different
time
to
their
worthy
landlord
,
before
we
leave
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
be
large
,
and
very
commodious
;
and
we
find
every
thing
about
it
,
and
in
it
,
exceed
neat
and
convenient
;
owe
to
the
worthy
Mr.
Longman
's
care
and
direction
.
<EOS>
the
ground
be
well
-
stock
,
the
barn
and
outhouse
in
excellent
repair
;
and
my
poor
parent
have
only
to
wish
,
that
they
and
I
may
be
deserve
of
half
the
goodness
we
experience
from
your
bountiful
brother
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
I
have
the
pleasure
of
discover
every
day
more
and
more
,
that
there
be
not
a
better
dispose
and
more
generous
man
in
the
world
than
himself
,
for
I
verily
think
he
have
not
be
so
careful
to
conceal
his
bad
action
as
his
good
one
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
naturally
beneficent
,
and
his
beneficence
be
the
gift
of
God
for
the
most
excellent
purpose
,
as
I
have
often
freely
tell
him
.
<EOS>
pardon
me
,
my
dear
lady
<EOS>
;
I
wish
I
may
not
be
impertinently
grave
:
but
I
find
a
great
many
instance
of
his
considerate
charity
,
which
few
know
of
,
and
which
,
since
I
have
be
his
almoner
,
could
not
avoid
come
to
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
possibly
,
be
no
news
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
every
body
know
the
generous
goodness
of
your
own
heart
:
every
one
want
relief
taste
the
bounty
of
your
excellent
mother
<EOS>
my
late
honoured
lady
:
so
that
'
tis
a
family
grace
,
and
I
have
no
need
to
speak
of
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
Madam
.
  
<EOS>
this
can
not
,
I
hope
,
be
construe
as
if
I
would
hereby
suppose
ourselves
less
obliged
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
so
godlike
in
human
nature
as
this
disposition
to
do
good
to
our
fellow
-
creature
:
for
be
it
not
follow
immediately
the
example
of
that
generous
Providence
which
every
minute
be
confer
blessing
upon
us
all
,
and
by
give
power
to
the
rich
,
make
them
but
the
dispenser
of
its
benefit
to
those
that
want
them
?
<EOS>
yet
,
as
there
be
but
too
many
object
of
compassion
,
and
as
the
most
beneficent
can
not
,
like
Omnipotence
,
do
good
to
all
,
how
much
be
they
oblige
who
be
distinguish
from
others!-And
<EOS>
this
be
keep
in
mind
,
will
always
contribute
to
make
the
benefit
receive
,
as
thankfully
as
they
ought
,
the
favour
of
the
obliger
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
if
I
write
to
be
understand
,
in
all
I
mean
;
but
my
grateful
heart
be
so
over
-
fill
when
on
this
subject
,
that
methink
I
want
to
say
a
great
deal
more
at
the
same
time
that
I
be
apprehensive
<EOS>
I
say
too
much
.
<EOS>
yet
,
perhaps
,
the
copy
of
the
letter
I
here
inclose
(
that
mark
[
I.
]
write
by
me
to
my
parent
,
on
our
return
to
Kent
;
that
mark
[
II

]
<EOS>
from
my
dear
father
in
answer
to
it
;
and
that
mark
[
III
.
]
<EOS>
mine
in
reply
to
his
)
<EOS>
will
(
at
the
same
time
that
they
may
convince
your
ladyship
that
I
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
in
the
course
of
this
correspondence
,
which
may
in
the
least
amuse
and
divert
you
,
or
better
explain
our
grateful
sentiment
)
,
in
a
great
measure
,
answer
what
your
ladyship
expect
from
me
,
as
to
the
happy
fortnight
we
pass
in
Kent
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
conclude
,
choose
to
suspend
the
correspondence
,
till
I
know
from
your
ladyship
,
whether
it
will
not
be
too
low
,
too
idle
for
your
attention
;
whether
you
will
not
dispense
with
your
own
command
when
you
see
I
be
so
little
likely
to
answer
what
you
may
possibly
expect
from
me
:
or
whether
,
if
you
insist
upon
my
scribbling
,
you
would
have
me
write
in
any
other
way
,
be
less
tedious
,
less
serious
-
in
short
,
less
or
more
any
thing
.
<EOS>
for
all
that
be
in
my
power
,
your
ladyship
may
command
from
,
Madam
,
your
obliged
and
faithful
servant
.
  
<EOS>
P.B.
  
Your
dear
brother
,
from
whose
knowledge
I
would
not
keep
any
thing
that
shall
take
up
any
considerable
portion
of
my
time
,
give
me
leave
to
proceed
in
this
correspondence
,
if
you
command
it
;
and
be
pleased
to
say
,
he
will
content
himself
to
see
such
part
of
it
,
and
only
such
part
,
<EOS>
as
I
shall
shew
him
,
or
read
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
this
very
good
,
Madam
?
 
<EOS>
o
,
my
lady
,
you
do
not
know
how
happy
I
be
!
    
<EOS>
from
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
<EOS>
B.
  
My
dear
Pamela
,
  
You
very
much
oblige
me
by
your
cheerful
compliance
with
my
request
<EOS>
:
I
leave
it
entirely
to
you
to
write
as
you
shall
be
in
the
humour
,
when
you
take
up
your
pen
;
and
then
I
shall
have
you
write
with
less
restraint
:
<EOS>
for
,
you
must
know
,
that
what
we
admire
in
you
,
be
truth
and
nature
,
not
study
or
elaborate
epistle
.
<EOS>
We
can
hear
at
church
,
or
read
in
our
closet
,
fifty
good
thing
that
we
expect
not
from
you
:
but
we
can
not
receive
from
any
body
else
the
pleasure
of
sentiment
flow
with
that
artless
ease
,
which
so
much
affect
us
when
we
read
your
letter
.
<EOS>
then
,
my
sweet
girl
,
your
gratitude
,
prudence
,
integrity
of
heart
,
your
humility
,
shine
so
much
in
all
your
letter
and
thought
,
that
no
wonder
my
brother
love
you
as
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
shall
make
you
proud
,
I
doubt
,
and
so
by
praise
ruin
those
grace
which
we
admire
,
and
,
but
for
that
,
can
not
praise
you
too
much
.
<EOS>
in
my
conscience
,
if
thou
canst
hold
as
thou
hast
begin
,
I
believe
thou
wilt
have
him
all
to
thyself
;
and
that
be
more
than
I
once
think
any
woman
on
this
side
<EOS>
the
seventieth
year
of
his
age
would
ever
be
able
to
say
.
<EOS>
the
letter
to
and
from
your
parent
,
we
be
charm
with
,
and
the
communicating
of
them
to
me
,
I
take
to
be
as
great
an
instance
of
your
confidence
in
me
,
as
it
be
of
your
judgment
and
prudence
;
for
you
can
not
but
think
,
that
we
,
his
relation
,
be
a
little
watchful
over
your
conduct
,
and
have
our
eye
upon
you
,
to
observe
what
use
you
be
likely
to
make
of
your
power
over
your
man
,
with
respect
to
your
own
relation
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
all
be
unexampled
prudence
,
and
you
take
the
right
method
to
reconcile
even
the
proud
of
us
to
your
marriage
,
and
make
us
not
only
love
you
,
but
respect
your
parent
:
for
their
honesty
will
,
I
perceive
,
be
their
distinguish
character
,
and
they
will
not
forget
themselves
,
nor
their
former
condition
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
,
you
be
exactly
right
;
for
if
you
be
to
be
an
encroacher
,
as
the
good
old
man
call
it
,
my
brother
would
be
the
first
to
see
it
,
and
would
gradually
think
less
and
less
of
you
,
till
possibly
he
may
come
to
despise
you
,
and
to
repent
of
his
choice
:
for
the
least
shadow
of
an
imposition
,
or
low
cunning
,
or
mere
selfishness
,
he
can
not
bear
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
you
be
a
charming
girl
;
and
Lady
Betty
say
so
too
;
and
moreover
add
,
that
if
he
make
you
not
the
good
and
faithfull
of
husband
,
he
can
not
deserve
you
,
for
all
his
fortune
and
birth
.
<EOS>
and
in
my
heart
,
I
begin
to
think
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
but
will
not
you
oblige
me
with
the
sequel
of
your
letter
to
your
father
?
<EOS>
for
,
you
promise
,
my
dear
charming
scribbler
,
in
that
you
send
me
,
to
write
again
to
his
letter
;
and
I
long
to
see
how
you
answer
the
latter
part
of
it
,
about
your
relation
desire
already
to
come
and
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
expect
from
you
.
<EOS>
but
let
it
be
what
it
will
,
send
it
to
me
exactly
as
you
write
it
;
and
I
shall
see
whether
I
have
reason
to
praise
or
reprove
you
.
<EOS>
for
surely
,
Pamela
,
you
must
leave
one
room
to
blame
you
for
something
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
can
hardly
bear
the
thought
,
that
you
should
so
much
excel
as
you
do
,
and
have
more
prudence
,
by
nature
,
as
it
be
,
than
the
good
of
us
get
in
a
course
of
the
genteel
education
and
with
fifty
advantage
,
at
least
,
in
conversation
,
that
you
could
not
have
,
by
reason
of
my
mother
's
retire
life
,
while
you
be
with
her
,
and
your
close
attendance
on
her
person
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
what
have
be
a
great
improvement
to
you
;
it
be
your
own
writing
.
<EOS>
this
itch
of
scribbling
have
be
a
charming
help
.
<EOS>
for
here
,
have
a
natural
fund
of
good
sense
,
and
prudence
above
your
year
,
you
have
,
with
the
observation
these
have
enable
you
to
make
<EOS>
,
be
flint
and
steel
too
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
yourself
:
so
that
you
have
strike
fire
when
you
please
,
want
nothing
but
a
few
dry
leave
,
like
the
first
pair
in
old
Du
Bartas
,
to
serve
as
tinder
to
catch
your
animate
spark
.
<EOS>
so
that
read
constantly
,
and
thus
use
yourself
to
write
,
and
enjoy
besides
a
good
memory
,
every
thing
you
hear
and
read
become
your
own
;
and
not
only
so
,
but
be
improve
by
pass
through
more
salubrious
duct
and
vehicle
;
like
some
fine
fruit
graft
upon
a
common
free
-
stock
,
whose
more
exuberant
juice
serve
to
bring
to
quick
and
great
perfection
the
downy
peach
,
or
the
smooth
nectarine
,
with
its
crimson
blush
.
  
<EOS>
really
,
Pamela
,
I
believe
,
I
,
too
,
shall
improve
by
write
to
you
-
<EOS>
why
,
you
dear
saucy
-
face
,
at
this
rate
,
you
will
make
every
one
that
converse
with
you
,
well
,
and
wise
,
and
wittier
too
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
than
they
ever
before
thought
there
be
room
for
'em
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
my
own
part
,
I
begin
to
like
what
I
have
write
myself
,
I
think
;
and
your
correspondence
may
revive
the
poetical
idea
that
use
to
fire
my
mind
,
before
I
enter
into
the
drowsy
married
life
;
for
my
good
Lord
Davers
's
turn
happen
not
to
be
to
book
;
and
so
by
degree
my
imagination
be
in
a
manner
quench
,
and
I
,
as
a
dutiful
wife
should
,
endeavour
to
form
my
taste
by
that
of
the
man
I
choose
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
Pamela
,
you
be
not
to
be
a
little
proud
of
my
correspondence
;
and
I
could
not
have
think
it
ever
would
have
come
to
this
;
but
you
will
observe
,
that
I
be
the
more
free
and
unreserved
,
to
encourage
you
to
write
without
restraint
:
for
already
you
have
make
us
a
family
of
writer
and
reader
;
so
that
Lord
Davers
himself
be
become
enamoured
of
your
letter
,
and
desire
of
all
thing
he
may
hear
read
every
one
that
pass
between
us
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
Jackey
,
for
that
matter
,
who
be
the
most
thoughtless
,
whistle
,
saunter
fellow
you
ever
know
,
and
whose
delight
in
a
book
run
no
high
than
a
song
or
a
catch
,
now
come
in
with
an
enquire
face
,
and
vow
he
will
set
pen
to
paper
,
and
turn
letter
-
writer
himself
;
and
intend
(
if
my
brother
will
not
take
it
amiss
,
he
say
)
to
begin
to
you
,
provide
he
could
be
sure
of
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
twenty
thing
still
to
say
;
for
you
have
unlock
all
our
bosom
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
intend
not
to
write
above
ten
or
a
dozen
line
when
I
begin
;
only
to
tell
you
,
that
I
would
have
you
take
your
own
way
,
in
your
subject
,
and
in
your
style
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
will
but
give
me
hope
,
that
you
be
in
the
way
I
so
much
wish
to
have
you
in
,
I
will
then
call
myself
your
affectionate
sister
;
but
till
then
,
it
shall
only
barely
be
your
correspondent
,
  
B.
DAVERS
.
<EOS>
You
will
proceed
with
the
account
of
your
kentish
affair
,
I
doubt
not
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
GOOD
lady
,
  
<EOS>
what
kind
,
what
generous
thing
be
you
pleased
to
say
of
your
happy
correspondent
!
<EOS>
and
what
reason
have
I
to
value
myself
on
such
an
advantage
as
be
now
before
me
,
if
I
be
capable
of
improve
it
as
I
ought
,
from
a
correspondence
with
so
noble
and
so
admire
a
lady
!
<EOS>
to
be
praise
by
such
a
genius
,
and
my
honoured
benefactor
's
worthy
sister
,
whose
favour
,
next
to
his
,
it
be
always
my
chief
ambition
to
obtain
,
be
what
would
be
enough
to
fill
with
vanity
a
steady
and
a
more
equal
mind
than
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
from
my
late
honoured
lady
,
what
a
fine
pen
<EOS>
her
beloved
daughter
be
mistress
of
,
when
she
please
to
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
could
have
presume
,
but
from
your
ladyship
's
own
motion
,
to
hope
to
be
in
any
manner
the
subject
of
it
,
much
less
to
be
call
your
correspondent
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
Madam
,
I
be
very
proud
of
this
honour
,
and
consider
it
as
such
a
heightening
to
my
pleasure
,
as
only
that
could
give
;
and
I
will
set
about
obey
your
ladyship
without
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
first
,
permit
me
to
disclaim
any
merit
,
from
my
own
poor
writing
,
to
that
improvement
which
your
goodness
impute
to
me
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
boast
,
of
that
sort
,
be
owe
principally
,
if
it
deserve
commendation
,
to
my
late
excellent
lady
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
be
imagine
what
pain
her
ladyship
take
with
her
poor
servant
.
<EOS>
besides
make
me
keep
a
book
of
her
charity
dispense
by
me
,
I
always
set
down
,
in
my
way
,
the
case
of
the
distressed
,
their
griefs
from
misfortune
,
and
their
joy
of
her
bountiful
relief
;
and
so
I
enter
early
into
the
various
turn
that
affect
worthy
heart
,
and
be
teach
the
well
to
regulate
my
own
,
especially
by
the
help
of
her
fine
observation
,
when
I
read
what
I
write
.
<EOS>
for
many
a
time
have
her
generous
heart
overflow
with
pleasure
at
my
remark
,
and
with
praise
;
and
I
be
her
good
girl
,
her
dear
Pamela
,
her
hopeful
maiden
;
and
she
would
sometimes
snatch
my
hand
with
transport
,
and
draw
me
to
her
,
and
vouchsafe
to
kiss
me
;
and
always
be
say
,
what
she
would
do
for
me
,
if
God
spare
her
,
and
I
continue
to
be
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
o
my
dear
lady
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
think
what
an
encouragement
this
condescend
behaviour
and
goodness
be
to
me
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
you
can
not
think
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
use
to
throw
myself
at
her
foot
,
and
embrace
her
knee
;
and
,
my
eye
stream
with
tear
of
joy
,
would
often
cry
,
"
o
continue
to
me
,
my
dear
lady
,
the
blessing
of
your
favour
,
and
kind
instruction
,
and
it
be
all
your
happy
Pamela
can
wish
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
proceed
to
obey
your
ladyship
,
and
write
with
as
much
freedom
<EOS>
as
I
possibly
can
:
for
you
must
not
expect
,
that
I
can
entirely
divest
myself
of
that
awe
which
will
necessarily
lay
me
under
a
great
restraint
,
than
if
write
to
my
parent
,
whose
partiality
for
their
daughter
make
me
,
in
a
manner
,
secure
of
their
good
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
to
shorten
the
work
before
me
,
in
the
account
I
be
to
give
of
the
sweet
fortnight
that
we
pass
in
Kent
,
I
enclose
not
only
the
copy
of
the
letter
your
ladyship
request
,
but
my
father
's
answer
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
I
send
before
,
and
those
I
now
send
,
will
afford
several
particular
;
such
as
a
brief
description
of
the
house
and
farm
,
and
your
honoured
brother
's
intention
of
retire
thither
now
-
and
-
then
;
of
the
happiness
and
gratitude
of
my
dear
parent
,
and
their
wish
to
be
able
to
deserve
the
comfort
his
goodness
have
heap
upon
them
;
and
that
in
strong
light
than
I
be
able
to
set
them
;
I
will
only
,
in
a
summary
manner
,
mention
the
rest
;
and
,
particularly
,
the
behaviour
of
my
dear
benefactor
to
me
,
and
my
parent
.
<EOS>
He
seem
always
to
delight
in
be
particularly
kind
to
them
before
stranger
,
and
before
the
tenant
,
and
before
Mr.
Sorby
,
Mr.
Bennet
,
and
Mr.
Shepherd
,
three
of
the
principal
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
,
with
their
lady
,
come
to
visit
us
,
and
whose
visit
we
all
return
;
for
your
dear
brother
would
not
permit
my
father
and
mother
to
decline
the
invitation
of
those
worthy
family
.
  
<EOS>
every
day
we
ride
out
,
or
walk
a
little
about
the
ground
;
and
while
we
be
there
,
he
employ
hand
to
cut
a
vista
through
a
coppice
,
as
they
call
it
,
or
rather
a
little
wood
,
to
a
rise
ground
,
which
,
front
an
old
-
fashioned
balcony
,
in
the
middle
of
the
house
,
he
order
it
to
be
plant
like
a
grove
,
and
a
pretty
alcove
to
be
erect
on
its
summit
,
of
which
he
have
send
them
a
draught
,
draw
by
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
this
and
a
few
other
alteration
,
mention
in
my
letter
to
my
father
,
be
to
be
finish
against
we
go
down
next
.
  
<EOS>
the
dear
gentleman
be
every
hour
press
me
,
while
there
,
to
take
one
diversion
or
other
,
frequently
upbraid
me
,
that
I
seem
not
to
choose
any
thing
,
urge
me
to
propose
sometimes
what
I
could
wish
he
should
oblige
me
in
,
and
not
always
to
leave
it
to
him
to
choose
for
me
:
say
,
he
be
half
afraid
that
my
constant
compliance
with
every
thing
he
propose
,
lay
me
sometimes
under
a
restraint
:
and
he
would
have
me
have
a
will
of
my
own
,
since
it
be
impossible
,
that
it
could
be
such
as
he
should
not
take
a
delight
in
conform
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
your
ladyship
with
any
further
particular
relate
to
this
happy
fortnight
,
which
be
make
up
all
of
white
and
unclouded
day
,
to
the
very
last
;
and
your
ladyship
will
judge
better
than
I
can
describe
,
of
the
parting
between
my
dear
parent
,
and
their
honour
benefactor
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
out
,
attend
with
the
good
wish
of
crowd
of
person
of
all
degree
;
for
your
dear
brother
leave
behind
him
noble
instance
of
his
bounty
;
it
be
the
first
time
,
as
he
bid
Mr.
Longman
say
,
that
he
have
be
down
among
them
since
that
estate
have
be
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
but
permit
me
to
observe
,
that
I
could
not
forbear
often
,
very
often
,
in
this
happy
period
,
to
thank
God
in
private
,
for
the
bless
term
upon
which
I
be
there
,
to
what
I
should
have
be
,
have
I
gracelessly
accept
of
those
which
formerly
be
tender
to
me
;
for
your
ladyship
will
remember
,
that
the
kentish
estate
be
to
be
part
of
the
purchase
of
my
infamy
.
  
<EOS>
We
return
through
London
,
by
the
like
easy
journey
,
but
tarry
not
to
see
any
thing
of
that
vast
metropolis
,
any
more
than
we
do
in
go
through
it
before
;
your
beloved
brother
only
stop
at
his
banker
's
,
and
desire
him
to
look
out
for
a
handsome
house
,
which
he
propose
to
take
for
his
winter
residence
.
<EOS>
He
choose
it
to
be
about
the
new
building
call
Hanover
Square
;
and
he
leave
Mr.
Longman
there
to
see
one
,
which
his
banker
believe
would
be
fit
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
,
my
dear
lady
,
I
have
answer
your
first
command
,
by
the
help
of
the
letter
which
pass
between
my
dear
parent
and
me
;
and
conclude
this
with
the
assurance
that
I
be
,
with
high
respect
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
my
dearest
lady
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
set
myself
to
obey
your
ladyship
's
second
command
,
which
be
,
to
give
an
account
in
what
manner
<EOS>
your
dear
brother
break
to
me
the
affair
of
the
unfortunate
Miss
Godfrey
,
with
my
behaviour
upon
it
;
and
this
I
can
not
do
better
,
than
by
transcribe
scribe
the
relation
I
give
at
that
time
,
in
letter
to
my
dear
parent
,
which
your
ladyship
have
not
see
,
in
these
very
word
.
  
<EOS>

My
dear
Mr.
B.
,
"

]
  
<EOS>
thus
far
,
my
dear
lady
,
the
relation
I
give
to
my
parent
,
at
the
time
of
my
be
first
acquaint
with
this
melancholy
affair
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
,
that
I
can
already
flatter
myself
,
from
the
hint
you
kindly
give
me
,
that
I
behave
as
you
wish
I
should
behave
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Madam
,
I
could
not
help
it
,
for
I
pity
most
sincerely
the
unhappy
lady
;
and
though
I
could
not
but
rejoice
,
that
I
have
have
the
grace
to
escape
the
dangerous
attempt
of
the
dear
intriguer
,
yet
never
do
the
story
of
any
unfortunate
lady
make
such
an
impression
upon
me
as
her
do
:
she
love
him
,
and
believe
,
no
doubt
,
he
love
her
too
well
to
take
ungenerous
advantage
of
her
soft
passion
for
him
:
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
degree
,
put
herself
into
his
power
;
and
too
seldom
,
<EOS>
alas
I
have
the
noblest
-
minded
of
the
seducing
sex
the
mercy
or
the
goodness
to
spare
the
poor
creature
that
do
!
  
<EOS>
then
'
tis
another
misfortune
of
people
in
love
;
they
always
think
highly
of
the
beloved
object
,
and
lowly
of
themselves
,
such
a
dismal
mortifier
be
love
!
  
<EOS>
I
say
not
this
,
Madam
,
to
excuse
the
poor
lady
's
fall
;
nothing
can
do
that
;
because
virtue
be
,
and
ought
to
be
,
preferable
to
all
consideration
,
and
to
life
itself
.
<EOS>
but
,
methink
,
I
love
this
dear
lady
so
well
for
the
sake
of
her
edifying
penitence
,
that
I
would
fain
extenuate
her
crime
,
if
I
could
;
and
the
rather
,
as
in
all
probability
,
it
be
a
first
love
on
both
side
;
and
so
he
could
not
appear
to
her
as
a
practised
deceiver
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
see
,
by
what
I
have
transcribe
,
how
I
behave
myself
to
the
dear
Miss
Goodwin
;
and
I
be
so
fond
of
the
little
charmer
,
as
well
for
<EOS>
the
sake
of
her
unhappy
mother
,
though
personally
unknown
to
me
,
as
for
the
relation
she
bear
to
the
dear
gentleman
whom
I
be
bind
to
love
and
honour
,
that
I
must
beg
your
ladyship
's
interest
to
procure
her
to
be
give
up
to
my
care
,
when
it
shall
be
think
proper
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
shall
act
by
her
as
tenderly
as
if
I
be
her
own
mother
.
<EOS>
and
glad
I
be
,
that
the
poor
unfaulty
baby
be
so
justly
beloved
by
Mr.
B.
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
here
conclude
this
letter
,
with
assure
your
ladyship
,
and
I
be
your
obliged
and
humble
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
my
good
lady
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
come
to
your
ladyship
's
remark
on
my
conduct
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
:
which
you
be
pleased
to
think
too
kind
and
forgiving
consider
the
poor
woman
's
baseness
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
say
,
that
I
ought
not
to
have
bear
her
in
my
sight
,
after
the
impudent
assistance
she
give
to
his
lewd
attempt
;
much
less
to
have
leave
her
in
her
place
,
and
reward
her
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
lady
,
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
a
poor
prisoner
as
I
be
make
,
for
week
together
,
in
breach
of
all
the
law
of
civil
society
;
without
a
soul
who
durst
be
my
friend
;
and
every
day
expect
to
be
ruin
and
undo
,
by
one
of
the
haughty
and
most
determined
spirit
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
it
please
God
to
turn
his
heart
,
and
incline
him
to
abandon
his
wicked
attempt
,
and
to
profess
honourable
love
to
me
,
his
poor
servant
,
can
it
be
think
I
be
to
insist
upon
condition
with
such
a
gentleman
,
who
have
me
in
his
power
;
and
who
,
if
I
have
provoke
him
,
may
have
resume
all
his
wicked
purpose
against
me
?
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
too
much
overjoyed
,
after
all
my
danger
past
(
which
be
so
great
,
that
I
could
not
go
to
rest
,
nor
rise
,
but
with
such
apprehension
,
that
I
wish
for
death
rather
than
life
)
,
to
think
of
refuse
any
term
that
I
could
yield
to
,
and
keep
my
honour
.
  
<EOS>
and
though
such
noble
lady
,
as
your
ladyship
and
Lady
Betty
,
who
be
bear
to
independency
,
and
be
hereditarily
,
as
I
may
say
,
on
a
foot
with
the
highest
-
descended
gentleman
in
the
land
,
may
have
exert
a
spirit
,
and
would
have
a
right
to
choose
your
own
servant
,
and
to
distribute
reward
and
punishment
to
the
deserve
and
undeserving
,
at
your
own
good
pleasure
;
yet
what
have
I
,
a
poor
girl
,
who
owe
even
my
title
to
common
notice
,
to
the
bounty
of
my
late
good
lady
,
and
have
only
a
kind
of
imputed
sightliness
of
person
,
though
enough
to
make
me
the
subject
of
vile
attempt
;
who
,
from
a
situation
of
terror
and
apprehension
,
be
lift
up
to
an
hope
,
beyond
my
high
ambition
,
and
be
bid
to
pardon
the
bad
woman
,
as
an
instance
,
that
I
could
forgive
his
own
hard
usage
of
me
;
who
have
experience
so
often
the
violence
and
impetuosity
of
his
temper
,
which
even
his
beloved
mother
never
venture
to
oppose
till
it
begin
to
subside
,
and
then
,
indeed
,
he
be
all
goodness
and
acknowledgment
;
of
which
I
could
give
your
ladyship
more
than
one
instance
.
  
<EOS>
what
,
I
say
,
have
I
to
do
,
to
take
upon
me
lady
-
air
,
and
to
resent
?
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
lady
(
let
me
,
in
this
instance
,
bespeak
the
attention
of
you
both
)
,
I
should
be
inexcusable
,
if
I
do
not
tell
you
all
the
truth
;
and
that
is
,
that
I
not
only
forgave
the
poor
wretch
,
in
regard
to
his
command
,
but
from
my
own
inclination
also
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
wrong
in
say
this
,
I
must
submit
it
to
your
ladyship
;
and
,
as
I
pretend
not
to
perfection
,
be
ready
to
take
the
blame
I
deserve
in
your
ladyship
'
judgment
:
but
indeed
,
be
it
to
be
again
<EOS>
,
I
verily
think
,
I
could
not
help
forgive
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
I
not
able
to
say
this
,
I
should
be
think
to
have
make
a
mean
court
to
my
master
's
passion
,
and
to
have
do
a
wrong
thing
with
my
eye
open
:
which
I
humbly
conceive
,
no
one
should
do
.
  
<EOS>
when
full
power
be
give
me
over
this
poor
creature
(
seemingly
at
least
,
though
it
may
possibly
have
be
resume
,
and
I
may
have
be
re
-
committed
to
her
,
have
I
give
him
reason
to
think
I
make
an
arrogant
use
of
it
)
<EOS>
,
you
can
not
imagine
what
a
triumph
I
have
in
my
mind
over
the
mortified
guilt
,
which
(
from
the
high
degree
of
insolence
and
imperiousness
,
that
before
have
harden
her
masculine
feature
)
appear
in
her
countenance
,
when
she
find
the
table
likely
to
be
soon
turn
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
change
of
behaviour
,
which
at
first
discover
itself
in
a
sullen
awe
,
and
afterwards
in
a
kind
of
silent
respect
,
shew
me
,
what
an
influence
power
have
over
her
:
and
that
when
she
could
treat
her
late
prisoner
,
when
take
into
favour
,
so
obsequiously
,
it
be
the
less
wonder
<EOS>
the
bad
woman
could
think
it
her
duty
to
obey
command
so
unjust
,
when
her
obedience
to
them
be
require
from
her
master
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
if
a
look
could
have
kill
her
,
after
some
of
her
bad
treatment
,
she
have
be
slay
over
and
over
,
as
I
may
say
:
but
to
me
,
who
be
always
teach
to
distinguish
between
the
person
and
the
action
,
I
could
not
hold
my
resentment
against
the
poor
passive
machine
of
mischief
one
day
together
,
though
her
action
be
so
odious
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
indeed
except
that
time
of
my
grand
trial
when
she
appear
so
much
a
wretch
to
me
,
that
I
see
her
not
(
even
after
two
day
that
she
be
keep
from
me
)
without
great
flutter
and
emotion
of
heart
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
represent
to
your
brother
before
<EOS>
,
how
hard
a
condition
it
be
for
me
to
forgive
so
much
unwomanly
wickedness
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
lady
,
when
I
consider
the
latter
in
one
particular
light
,
I
could
the
more
easily
forgive
her
;
and
have
forgive
her
,
bear
her
in
my
sight
,
and
act
by
her
(
as
a
consequence
of
that
forgiveness
)
as
if
she
have
not
so
horridly
offend
.
<EOS>
else
how
would
it
have
be
forgiveness
?
<EOS>
especially
as
she
be
ashamed
of
her
crime
,
and
there
be
no
fear
of
her
repeat
it
.
  
<EOS>
thus
then
I
think
on
the
occasion
:
"
poor
wretched
agent
,
for
purpose
little
less
than
infernal
!
<EOS>
I
will
forgive
thee
,
since
thy
master
and
my
master
will
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
thou
art
beneath
the
resentment
even
of
such
a
poor
girl
as
I.
<EOS>
I
will
pity
thee
,
base
and
abject
as
thou
art
.
<EOS>
and
she
who
be
the
object
of
my
pity
be
surely
beneath
my
anger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
then
my
thought
,
my
proud
thought
,
so
far
be
I
from
be
guilty
of
intentional
meanness
in
forgiving
,
at
Mr.
B.
's
interposition
,
the
poor
,
low
,
creep
,
abject
self
-
mortify
,
and
master
-
mortify
,
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
and
do
you
think
,
<EOS>
lady
,
when
you
revolve
in
your
thought
,
who
I
be
,
and
what
I
be
,
and
what
I
have
be
design
for
;
when
you
revolve
the
amazing
turn
in
my
favour
,
and
the
prospect
before
me
(
so
much
above
my
hope
,
that
I
leave
them
entirely
to
Providence
to
direct
for
me
,
as
it
please
,
without
dare
to
look
forward
to
what
those
prospect
seem
naturally
to
tend
)
;
when
I
could
see
my
haughty
persecutor
become
my
repentant
protector
;
the
lofty
spirit
that
use
to
make
me
tremble
,
and
to
which
I
never
could
look
up
without
awe
,
except
in
those
animate
case
,
where
his
guilty
attempt
,
and
the
concern
I
have
to
preserve
my
innocence
,
give
a
courage
more
than
natural
to
my
otherwise
dastardly
heart
:
when
this
impetuous
spirit
could
stoop
to
request
one
whom
he
have
sink
beneath
even
her
usual
low
character
of
his
servant
,
who
be
his
prisoner
,
under
sentence
of
a
ruin
bad
than
death
,
as
he
have
intend
it
,
and
have
seize
her
for
that
very
purpose
,
could
stoop
to
acknowledge
the
vileness
of
that
purpose
;
could
say
,
at
one
time
,
that
my
forgiveness
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
should
stand
me
in
great
stead
than
I
be
aware
of
:
could
tell
her
,
before
me
,
that
she
must
for
the
future
<EOS>
shew
me
<EOS>
all
the
respect
due
to
one
he
must
love
;
at
another
,
acknowledge
before
her
,
that
he
have
be
stark
naught
,
and
that
I
be
very
forgiving
;
again
,
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
put
himself
on
a
level
with
her
,
as
to
guilt
,
"
We
be
both
in
generous
hand
:
and
,
indeed
,
if
Pamela
do
not
pardon
you
,
I
should
think
she
but
half
forgave
me
,
because
you
act
by
my
instruction
:
"
<EOS>
another
time
to
the
same
,
"
We
have
be
both
sinner
,
and
must
be
both
include
in
one
act
of
grace
:
"
 
when
I
be
thus
lift
up
to
the
state
of
a
sovereign
forgiver
,
and
my
lordly
master
become
a
petitioner
for
himself
,
and
the
guilty
creature
,
whom
he
put
under
my
foot
;
what
a
triumph
be
here
for
the
poor
Pamela
?
<EOS>
and
could
I
have
be
guilty
of
<EOS>
so
mean
a
pride
,
as
to
trample
upon
the
poor
abject
creature
,
when
I
find
her
thus
lowly
,
thus
mortify
,
and
wholly
in
my
power
?
  
<EOS>
then
,
my
dear
lady
,
while
I
be
enjoy
the
soul
-
charm
fruit
of
that
innocence
which
the
Divine
Grace
have
enable
me
to
preserve
,
in
spite
of
so
many
plot
and
contrivance
on
my
master
's
side
,
and
such
wicked
instigation
and
assistance
on
her
,
and
all
my
prospect

uplifted
handkerchief

triumph

exalted

Pamela

I
do
less
than
pardon
her
?
<EOS>

have
declare
that
I
do
so
,
be
I
not
to
shew
the
sincerity
of
my
declaration

<EOS>
Would
it
not
have
shew
my
master

that
the
low

bear
Pamela

incapable
of
a
generous
action

have
she
refuse
the
only
request
her
humble
condition
have
give
her
the
opportunity
of
grant
,
at
that
time

with
innocence

<EOS>
Would
he
not
have
think
the
humble
cottager
as
capable
of
insolence
,

vengeance
too
,
in
her
turn
,
as
the
better
bear
?
<EOS>

that
she
want
<EOS>

the
power

to
shew
the
like
unrelenting
temper

by
which
she
have
so
grievously
suffer
?

may
not
this
have
give
him
room
to
think
me
(
and
to
have
resume
and
prosecute
his
purpose
accordingly

<EOS>
fitter
for
an
arrogant

mistress

than
an
humble

obliged

I
see

may
he
not

strong
passion

resentment

will
improve
upon

not

temptation

<EOS>
may
not
this
have
be
the
language
,
and
this
the
resolution
,
of
such
a
dear
wicked
intriguer
?
 
<EOS>
for
,
my
lady
,
you
can
hardly
conceive
the
struggle
he
apparently
have
to
bring
down
his
high
spirit
to
so
humble
a
level
.
<EOS>
and
though
,
I
hope
,
all
would
have
be
,
even
in
this
bad
case
,
ineffectual
,
through
Divine
Grace
,
yet
<EOS>
how
do
I
know
what
lurk
vileness
may
have
appear
by
degree
in
this
frail
heart
,
to
encourage
his
design
,
and
to
augment
my
trial
and
my
danger
?
<EOS>
and
perhaps
downright
violence
may
have
be
use
,
if
he
could
not
,
on
one
hand
,
have
subdue
his
passion
,
nor
,
on
the
other
,
have
overcome
his
pride
 
a
pride
,
that
every
one
,
reflect
upon
the
disparity
of
birth
and
condition
between
us
,
would
have
dignify
with
the
name
of
decency
;
a
pride
that
be
become
such
an
essential
part
of
the
dear
gentleman
's
character
,
in
this
instance
of
a
wife
,
that
although
he
know
he
could
not
keep
it
up
,
if
he
make
me
happy
,
yet
it
be
no
small
motive
of
his
choose
me
,
in
one
respect
,
because
he
expect
from
me
more
humility
,
more
submission
,
than
he
think
would
be
pay
him
by
a
lady
equally
bear
and
educate
;
and
of
this
I
will
send
you
an
instance
,
in
a
transcription
from
that
part
of
my
journal
<EOS>
you
have
not
see
,
of
his
lesson
to
me
,
on
my
incur
his
displeasure
by
interpose
between
yourself
and
him
in
your
misunderstanding
at
the
Hall
:
for
,
Madam
,
I
intend
to
send
,
at
time
,
any
thing
I
think
worthy
of
your
ladyship
's
attention
,
out
of
those
paper
<EOS>
you
be
so
kind
as
to
excuse
me
from
send
you
in
a
lump
,
and
many
of
which
must
need
have
appear
very
impertinent
to
such
judge
.
  
<EOS>
thus
(
could
your
ladyship
have
think
it
?
)
<EOS>
have
I
venture
upon
a
strange
paradox
,
that
even
this
strong
instance
of
his
debase
himself
,
be
not
the
weak
of
his
pride
:
and
he
venture
once
at
Sir
Simon
Darnford
's
to
say
,
in
your
hearing
,
as
you
may
remember
,
that
,
in
his
conscience
,
he
think
he
should
hardly
have
make
a
tolerable
husband
to
any
body
but
Pamela
:
and
why
?
<EOS>
for
the
reason
you
will
see
in
the
inclose
paper
,
which
give
an
account
of
the
noble
and
early
curtain
-
lecture
that
ever
girl
have
:
one
of
which
be
,
that
he
expect
to
be
bear
with
(
comply
with
,
he
mean
)
even
when
in
the
wrong
:
another
,
that
a
wife
should
never
so
much
as
expostulate
with
him
,
though
he
be
in
the
wrong
,
till
,
by
comply
with
all
he
insist
upon
,
she
should
have
shew
him
,
she
design
rather
to
convince
him
,
for
his
own
sake
,
than
for
contradiction
's
sake
;
and
then
,
another
time
,
perhaps
he
may
take
well
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
from
what
I
have
say
,
it
will
appear
to
your
lady
-
ship
,
and
to
Lady
Betty
too
,
that
I
be
justified
,
or
at
least
excuse
,
in
pardon
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
  
<EOS>
but
your
dear
brother
have
just
send
me
word
<EOS>
,
that
supper
wait
for
me
:
and
the
post
be
ready
to
go
off
,
I
defer
till
the
next
opportunity
which
I
have
to
say
as
to

obliged

P.B.
    
my

I
will
now
acquaint
you
with
the
good
effect
my
behaviour
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
have
upon
her
,
as
a
farth
justification
of
my
conduct
towards
the
poor
woman
.
  
<EOS>
that
she
begin
to
be
affect
as
I
wish

to
me
before
I
leave
the
Hall
,
not
only
in
the
conversation
I
have
with
her
after
my
happiness
be
complete
;
but
in
her
general
demeanour
also
to
the
servant

to
the
neighbour

in
her
devout
behaviour
at
church
:
and

further
appear
by
a
letter

from
Miss
Darnford

<EOS>
I
dare
say
your

will
be
pleased
with
the
perusal
of
the
whole
letter
,
although
a
part
of
it
would
answer
my
present
design
;
and
in
confidence
,
that
you
will
excuse
,
for
the
sake
of
its
other
beauty
,
the
high
and
undeserved
praise
which
she
so
lavishly
bestow
upon

I
will
transcribe
it
all

the

to
him

not

as

sad

cheerful

You

pray
your

the
boldness

reflect
upon

when

often
most
justly

call
them

but
I
may
go
on
thus
for
ever
accuse
myself

not
consider
whom
I
be
write
to

whose
precious
time
I

take
up

what
I

to

for
,
oh
!
<EOS>
Madam

I

We

the
charity

the
mercy

tell
me
if

Your

assure
me
,
at
your
departure

on
the
confession
of
my
remorse
for
my
misdoing
,

my
promise
of
amendment

you
would
take
it
for

I
would
endeavour

keep
up
a
regularity
among

if
I
would
subdue
them
with
kindness
,
as
I
have
own
myself
subdued
;

if
I
would
endeavour
to
make
every

that
the
good
security
they
could
give
of

it

<EOS>
this
,
I
remember

your

tell
me

be
the
good
test
of
fidelity
and
duty
,
that
any
servant
could
shew
;
since
it
be
impossible
,
without
religion
,
but
that
worldly
convenience
,
or
self

interest

must
be
the
main
tie
;

so
the
bad
action
may
succeed

if

should
find
their
sordid
advantage
in

their
duty

so
well
be
I
convince
of
this
truth

that
I

I
have
begin
the
example

as
no

so
wicked

it
be

less
difficult
to
reform
them

you
will
have

pleasure
to
know

Tis
true

I
find
it
a
little
difficult
at
first
to
keep
them
within

after
your

but
when
they
see
I
be
in

use
them
courteously

as
you
advise

as
your
usage

the
rightest
usage

when
they
be
tell
I
have
your
command

acquaint
you

they
conform
to
your
injunction

the
task
become
easy

<EOS>
I
have
already
,
with
these
transcribe
letter
of
Miss
Darnford
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
write
a
great
deal
:
but
nevertheless
,
as
there
yet
remain
one
passage
in
your

's
letter
,
relate
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
<EOS>
,
that
seem
to
require
an
answer
,
I
will
take
notice
of
it
,
if
I
shall
not
quite
tire
your
patience
.
  
<EOS>
that
passage
be
this
;
Lady
Betty
rightly
observe
,
say
your
ladyship
,
that
he
know
what
a
vile
woman
<EOS>
she
[
Mrs.
Jewkes
]
be
,
when
he
put
you
into
her
power
;
and
no
doubt
,
employ
her
,
because
he
be
sure
she
would
answer
all
his
purpose
:
and
therefore
she
should
have
have
very
little
opinion
of
the
sincerity
of
his
reformation
,
while
he
be
so
solicitous
in
keep
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
,
she
say
,
have
she
be
in
your
case
,
have
have
one
struggle
for
her
dismission
,
let
it
have
be
take
as
it
would
;
and
he
that
be
so
well
pleased
with
your
virtue
,
must
have
think
this
a
natural
consequence
of
it
,
if
in
earnest
to
become
virtuous
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
he
be
not
so
well
pleased
with
my
virtue
for
virtue
's
sake
,
as
Lady
Betty
think
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
glad
,
even
then
,
to
have
find
me
less
resolve
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
so
much
as
pretend
to
any
disposition
to
virtue
.
<EOS>
no
,
not
he
!
  
<EOS>
He
have
entertain
,
as
it
prove
,
a
strong
passion
for
me
,
which
have
be
heighten
by
my
resist
it
.
<EOS>
His
pride
,
and
his
advantage
both
of
person
and
fortune
,
would
not
let
him
brook
control
;
and
when
he
could
not
have
me
upon
his
own
term
,
God
turn
his
evil
purpose
to
good
one
;
and
he
resolve
to
submit
to
mine
,
or
rather
to
such
as
he
find
I
would
not
yield
to
him
without
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Betty
think
,
I
be
to
blame
to
put
Mrs.

upon
a
foot
,
<EOS>
in
the
present
I
make
on
my
nuptial
,
with
Mrs.
Jervis

I
rather
put
Mrs.
Jervis
on
a
foot
with
Mrs.
Jewkes

for
the
dear
gentleman
have
name
the
sum
for
me
to
give
Mrs.

,
and
I
would
not
give
Mrs.
Jervis
less
,
because
I
love
her
better
;
nor
more
could
I
give
her
,
on
that
occasion
,
without
make
such
a
difference
between
two
person
equal
in
station

on
a
solemnity

one
be
present

as
would
have
shew
such
a

may
have
induce
their

conclude

I
be
not
so
sincere
in
my
forgiveness
,
as
he
hope
from
me
,
and
as
I
really
be

<EOS>

a
strong
reason
still
be
behind
;
that
I
could
,
much
more
agreeably
,
both
to
Mrs.
Jervis

myself
,
shew
my
love

gratitude

do

I

;
"
I

I
leave

<EOS>
if

in

I

most
willingly
;
although

make
a
shew

"
  
<EOS>

something
like
it

"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
have
promise
them
this
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
dress
otherwise
than
I
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
be
pleased
to
say
,
I
be
always
what
he
wish
me
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
leave
me
to
my
good
work
<EOS>
(
those
be
his
kind
word
)
and
I
run
over
Mrs.
Jervis
's
account
,
and
find
a
balance
draw
of
all
her
matter
in
one
leaf
,
and
a
thankful
acknowledgment
to
God
,
for
her
master
's
last
bounty
,
which
have
enable
her
to
give
satisfaction
to
other
,
and
to
do
herself
great
pleasure
,
write
underneath
.
  
<EOS>
the
balance
of
all
be
thirty
-
five
pound
eleven
shilling
and
odd
penny
;
and
I
go
to
my
escritoir
,
and
take
out
forty
pound
,
and
down
<EOS>
I
haste
to
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
I
say
to
her
,
"
here
,
my
dear
good
friend
,
be
your
pocket
-
book
;
but
be
thirty
-
five
or
thirty
-
six
pound
all
you
owe
,
or
be
bind
for
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
Madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
enough
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
sum
;
but
'
tis
in
four
hand
,
and
they
be
all
in
pretty
good
circumstance
,
and
so
convinced
of
my
honesty
,
that
they
will
never
trouble
me
for
it
;
for
I
have
reduce
the
debt
every
year
something
,
since
I
have
be
in
my
master
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
shall
it
ever
be
in
any
body
's
power
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
trouble
you
:
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
how
we
will
order
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
sit
down
,
and
make
her
sit
by
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
be
forty
pound
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
much
to
me
now
,
as
the
two
guinea
be
to
you
,
that
you
would
have
give
me
at
my
go
away
from
this
house
to
my
father
's
,
as
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
give
it
you
neither
,
at
least
at
present
,
as
you
shall
hear
:
indeed
I
will
not
make
you
so
uneasy
as
that
come
to
.
<EOS>
but
take
this
,
and
pay
the
thirty
-
five
pound
odd
money
to
the
utmost
farthing
;
and
the
remain
four
pound
odd
will
be
a
little
fund
in
advance
towards
the
child
's
schooling
.
<EOS>
and
thus
you
shall
repay
it
;
I
always
design
,
as
our
dear
master
add
five
guinea
per
annum
to
your
salary
,
in
acknowledgement
of
the
pleasure
he
take
in
your
service
,
when
I
be
Pamela
Andrews
,
to
add
five
pound
per
annum
to
it
from
the
time
I
become
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
but
from
that
time
,
for
so
many
year
to
come
,
you
shall
receive
no
more
than
you
do
,
till
the
whole
forty
pound
be
repay
.
<EOS>
so
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
you
will
not
have
any
obligation
to
me
,
you
know
,
but
for
the
advance
;
and
that
be
a
poor
matter
,
not
to
be
speak
of
:
<EOS>
and
I
will
have
leave
for
it
,
for
fear
I
should
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
your
ladyship
see
the
dear
good
woman
's
behaviour
,
on
this
occasion
,
you
would
never
have
forget
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
;
tear
run
down
her
cheek
in
plentiful
current
:
her
modest
hand
put
gently
from
her
my
offering
hand
,
her
bosom
heav'd
,
and
she
sobb'd
<EOS>
with
the
painful
tumult
that
seem
to
struggle
within
her
,
and
which
,
for
some
few
moment
,
make
her
incapable
of
speak
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
rise
,
and
put
my
arm
round
her
neck
,
wipe
her
eye
,
and
kiss
her
cheek
,
she
cry
,
"
<EOS>
My
excellent
lady
!
'
<EOS>
tis
too
much
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
all
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
then
throw
herself
at
my
foot
;
for
I
be
not
strong
enough
to
hinder
it
;
and
with
uplifted
hand
 
"
May
God
Almighty
,
"
say
she
 
<EOS>
I
kneel
by
her
,
and
clasp
her
hand
in
mine
,
both
uplift
together
 
"
May
God
Almighty
,
"
say
I
,
drown
her
voice
with
my
loud
voice
,
"
bless
us
both
together
,
for
many
happy
year
!
<EOS>
and
bless
and
reward
the
dear
gentleman
,
who
have
thus
enable
me
to
make
the
widow
's
heart
to
sing
for
joy
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
thus
,
my
lady
,
do
I
force
upon
the
good
woman
's
acceptance
the
forty
pound
.
  
<EOS>
permit
me
,
Madam
,
to
close
this
letter
here
,
and
to
resume
the
subject
in
my
next
:
till
when
I
have
the
honour
to
be
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
my
dear
lady
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
resume
my
last
subject
where
I
leave
off
,
that
your
ladyship
may
have
the
whole
before
you
at
one
view
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
after
dinner
,
with
my
dear
benefactor
,
to
Lady
Arthur
's
;
and
meet
with
fresh
call
upon
me
for
humility
,
have
the
two
natural
effect
of
the
praise
and
professed
admiration
of
that
lady
's
guest
,
as
well
as
my

Mr.
B.
's
,
and
those
of
Mr.

Mrs.

,
to
guard

against
:
and
your

to

in

with
an
account
of
the

in
relation
to
the
London
house
,
which
be
actually

,
and
the
furniture

for
it

so
that
I
have
no
opportunity
to
tell
him
what
I
have
do
in
relation
to
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
but
after

,
retire
from
company
to

when

<EOS>

your

brother
,
who
be
pleased
to

,
I
be
no

<EOS>
how
inexcusable

if

a

who
teach
me
on

knee
,
and

with
a

.
  
<EOS>
I
request
him
to

or
three
place
that
be
beyond

;
and
when
he

do
it
,
he
ask
me
,
in
French

what
I
have
do
for
Mrs.
Jervis

<EOS>
I
say

<EOS>
and
if

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
He
put
his

round
me

and
look
down
now
and
then
,
as
I
desire

<EOS>
He
raise
my

kiss
me
two

three
time

say
,
"
thus
then
I

My

attend
to
know
if
I
want
her
assistance
to
undress
,
I
bid
her
call
Mrs.

and
though
I
think
from
his

look

and
kind
word
,
as
well
as
tender
behaviour
,
that
I
have
not
much
to

the
good

come

enter
with
all

move
his

<EOS>
She
look
surprised
 
now
on

now
on
her

<EOS>
I
,
not

what
he

look
a

attentive

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
 
I
be
very
sorry

curtsey
low

should

<EOS>

why
,
Mrs.

I
can
not

<EOS>
it

<EOS>
this
give
us
both
confusion

the

interrupt
her

My
charge

<EOS>
"
the
dear
creature
,
"
say
he
,
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"
seldom
do
any
thing
that
can
be
mend
;
but
,
I
think
,
when
your
good
conduct
deserve
an
annual
acknowledgment
from
me
,
in
addition
to
your
salary
,
the
lady
should
have
shew
herself
no
less
pleased
with
your
service
than
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
for
old
acquaintance
-
sake
,
for
sex
-
sake
<EOS>
,
she
should
not
have
give
me
cause
to
upbraid
her
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
,
that
you
must
look
upon
the
forty
pound
you
have
,
as
the
effect
of
just
distinction
on
many
account
:
and
your
salary
from
last
quarter
-
day
shall
be
advance
,
as
the
dear
niggard
intend
it
some
year
hence
;
and
let
me
only
add
,
that
when
my
Pamela
first
begin
to
shew
a
coldness
to
her
Mrs.
Jervis
,
I
shall
then
suspect
she
be
begin
to
decline
in
that
humble
virtue
,
which
be
now
peculiar
to
herself
and
make
her
the
delight
of
all
who
converse
with
her
.

<EOS>
He
be
thus
pleased
to
say
:
thus
,
with
the
most
graceful
generosity
,
and
a
nobleness
of
mind
truly
peculiar
to
himself
,
be
he
please
to
act
:
and
what
could
Mrs.
Jervis
or
I
say
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
,
nothing
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
We
could
only
look
upon
one
another
,
with
our
eye
and
our
heart
full
of
a
gratitude
that
would
not
permit
either
of
us
to
speak
,
but
which
express
itself
at
last
in
a
manner
he
be
pleased
to
call
more
elegant
than
word
 
with
uplifted
folded
hand
,
and
tear
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
o
my
dear
lady
!
<EOS>
how
many
opportunity
have
the
beneficent
rich
to
make
themselves
,
as
well
as
their
fellow
-
creature
,
happy
!
<EOS>
all
that
I
could
think
,
or
say
,
or
act
,
be
but
my
duty
before
;
what
a
sense
of
obligation
then
must
I
lie
under
to
this
most
generous
of
man
!
  
<EOS>
but
here
let
me
put
an
end
to
this
tedious
subject
;
the
principal
part
of
which
can
have
no
excuse
,
if
it
may
not
serve
as
a
proof
of
my
cheerful
compliance
with
your
ladyship
's
command
,
that
I
recite
every
thing
of
concern
to
me
,
and
with
the
same
freedom
as
I
use
to
do
to
my
dear
parent
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
do
it
,
and
at
the
same
time
offer
what
I
have
to
plead
in
behalf
of
my
conduct
to
the
two
housekeeper
,
which
you
expect
from
me
;
and
I
shall
therefore
close
this
my
humble
defence
,
if
I
may
so
call
it

with
the
assurance
that
I

where

it

I
can
not

I

as
I
remember

my

of
his

your

<EOS>
in
truth
,
thou
art
a
surprising
creature

every
letter

have
from

we
have
new
subject

admire
you
for

<EOS>
why
,
you
dear
charm
Pamela
,
do
you
only
excel
me
in
word
,
I
could
forgive
you
:
for
there
may
be
a
knack
,
and
a
volubility
,
as
to
word
,
that
a
natural
talent
may
supply
;

to
be

out

do
in

in

who
can
bear
it

<EOS>
and
in
so
young
an
insulter
too
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
Pamela
,
look
to
it
,
when
I
see
you
:
you
shall
feel
the
weight
of
my
hand
,
or
 
the
pressure
of
my
lip
,
one
or
t'other
,
depend
on
it
,
very
quickly
;
for
here
,
instead
of
my
stooping
,
as
I
think
I
would
be
,
to
call
you
sister
,
I
shall
be
force
to
think
,
in
a
little
while
,
that
you
ought
not
to
own
me
as
yours
,
till
I
be
nearer
your
standard
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
come
to
business
,
I
will
summarily
take
notice
of
the
follow
particular
in
all
your
obliging
letter
,
in
order
to
convince
you
of
my
friendship
,
by
the
freedom
of
my
observation
on
the
subject
you
touch
upon
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
I
be
highly
pleased
with
what
you
write
of
the
advantage
you
receive
from
the
favour
of
my
dear
mother
;
and
as
you
know
many
thing
of
her
by
your
attendance
upon
her
the
last
three
or
four
year
of
her
life
,
I
must
desire
you
will
give
me
,
as
opportunity
shall
offer
,
all
you
can
recollect
in
relation
to
the
honoured
lady
,
and
of
her
behaviour
and
kindness
to
you
,
and
with
a
retrospect
to
your
own
early
beginning
,
the
dawning
of
this
your
bright
day
of
excellence
:
and
this
not
only
I
,
but
the
countess
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
with
whom
I
be
go
over
your
paper
again
,
and
her
sister
,
Lady
Jenny
,
request
of
you

<EOS>

.
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
with
your
kentish
account
;
though
we
wish
you
have
be
more
particular
in
some
part
of
it
;
for
we
be
greatly
take
with
your
description
:
and
your
conversation
piece
:
yet
I
own
,
your
honest
father
's
letter
,
and
yours
,
a
good
deal
supply
that
defect

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
be
highly
delighted
with
your
account
of
my

break
to
you
the
affair
of
Sally
Godfrey
,
and
your
conduct
upon
it

'
<EOS>
tis
a
sweet
story
as
he
bring
it
in

and
as
you
relate
it
.
<EOS>
the
wretch
have
be
very
just
in
his
account
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
be
in
love
with
your
charitable
reflection
in
favour
of
the
poor
lady
;
and
the
more
,
as
she
certainly
deserve
them
,
and
a
well
mother
too
than
she
have
,
and
a
faithfuller
lover
than
she
meet
with

<EOS>
You
have
exactly
hit
his
temper
in
your
declare
love
of
Miss
Goodwill
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
child
,
you
know
your
man
;
and
never
fear
<EOS>
but
you
will
hold
him
,
if
you
can
go
on
thus
to
act
,
and
outdo
your
sex
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
think
you
may
as
well
not
insist
upon
have
her
with
you
;
you
would
better
see
her
now
<EOS>
and
then
at
the
dairy
-
house
,
or
at
school
,
than
have
her
with
you
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
leave
to
your
own
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
5
.
<EOS>
You
have
satisfactorily
answer
our
objection
to
your
behaviour
to
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
consider
your
circumstance
quite
so
thoroughly
as
we
ought
to
have
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
charming
girl
,
and
all
your
motive
be
so
just
,
that
we
shall
be
a
little
more
cautious
for
the
future
how
we
censure
you
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
say
with
the
countess
,
"
this
good
girl
be
not
without
her
pride
;
but
it
be
the
pride
that
become
,
and
can
only
attend
the
innocent
heart
;
and
I
will
warrant
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
"
nobody
will
become
her
station
so
well
,
as
one
who
be
capable
of
so
worthy
a
pride
as
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
what
a
curtain
-
lecture
hadst
thou
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
a
noble
one
,
dost
thou
call
it
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
what
a
wretch
hast
thou
get
,
to
expect
thou
shouldst
never
expostulate
against
his
lordly
will
,
even
when
in
the
wrong
,
till
thou
hast
obey
it
,
and
of
consequence
,
join
in
the
evil
he
impose
!
  
<EOS>
much
good
<EOS>
may
such
a
husband
do
you
,
say
Lady
Betty
!
 
<EOS>
every
body
will
admire
you
,
but
no
one
will
have
reason
to
envy
you
upon
those
principle
.

<EOS>
I
be
pleased
with
your
promise
of
send
what
you
think
I
shall
like
to

out
of
those
paper
you
choose
not

shew
me
collectively

very
obliging

You

a
good

I
love
you

7

<EOS>
We
have
all
smile
at
your
paradox
,
Pamela
,
that
his
marrying
you
be
an
instance
of
his
pride
.
 
<EOS>
the
thought
,
though
,
be
pretty
enough
,
and
ingenious
;
but
whether
it
will
hold
or
not

I
will
not
just
now
examine

Your

You

every
letter
that
pass

you

pray
send
in
your

her
letter

I
must
insist
upon
it

<EOS>
I
be
glad

oblige
me
with
your

do
not

unreasonable

Pray
 
<EOS>
have

Lady

want
to
know
(

what

<EOS>
for
,
she

it
cut
him

I

so
too

Your

It

enlarge
on

for
such
fondness
of

be
any

be
so
rare

and
so
unexpected

subject

Thou

more
deficient
in
hitherto

he
can
either
answer
to

lose
by

every
absent
member

reproach
himself

he

such

many

smart
under
some
heavy

they
have
make
vow

resolution

have
hold
them
no
longer
than
the
discipline
last

but
you
give
me
much
well
hope
of
the
sincerity
of
your
conversion
;
as
you
be
so
well
convinced
,
before
some
sore
evil
have
overtake
you
:
and
it
ought
to
be
an
earnest
to
you

the
Divine
favour

should
keep
you
from
despondency

as
to
me

it
become
me

forgive
you

I
most

as
it
prove

a
necessary

exalt
me

rejoice

the
kind

most
generous
of

often
pray
for
you

God

high

look
upon
you

to
my

May
the
Divine
goodness
enable
you

when
you
can
taste
the
all

surpass
pleasure
that
fill
the

your

improvement
result

me

therefore
,
dear
Mrs.
Jewkes

indeed
you
be
dear

caution
you
against
two
thing
;
the
one
,
that
you
return
not
to
your
former
way
,
and
wilfully
err
after
this
repentance
;
for
the
Divine
goodness
will
then
look
upon
itself
as
mock
by
you
,
and
will
withdraw
itself
from
you
;
and
more
dreadful
will
your
state
then
be
,
than
if
you
have
never
repent
:
<EOS>
the
other
,
that
you
do
not
despair
of
the
Divine
mercy
,
which
have
so
evidently
manifest
itself
in
your
favour

and
have
awaken
you
out
of
your
deplorable
lethargy

without
those
sharp
medicine
and
operation
,
which
other
,

perhaps
not
more
faulty
person

have
suffer

go
on
cheerfully
in
the

happy
path

<EOS>
depend
upon
it

you
be
now
in
the
right
way

turn
not
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
;
for
the
reward
be
before
you
,
in
reputation
and
a
good
fame
in
this
life

everlasting
felicity
beyond
it

my

have
I
obey
you

in

these

letter

<EOS>
I
will
now
proceed
to
your

's
twelve
article

<EOS>
as

the

<EOS>
I
will
oblige
your
ladyship
,
as
I
have
opportunity
,
in
my
future
letter
,
with
such
account
of
my
dear
lady
's
favour
and
goodness
to
me

as
I
think
will
be
acceptable
to
you

to
the
noble

<EOS>
I
be
extremely
delighted
,
that
your
ladyship
think
so
well
of
my
dear
honest
parent
:
they
be
good
people
,
and
ever
have
mind
that
set
them
above
low
and
sordid
action
:
and
God
and
your
good
brother
have
reward
them
most
amply
in
this
world
,
which
be
more
than
they
ever
expect
,
after
a
series
of
unprosperousness
in
all
they
undertake
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
be
pleased
to
say
,
that
people
in
upper
life
love
to
see
how
plain
nature
operate
in
honest
mind
,
who
have
hardly
any
thing
else
for
their
guide
:
<EOS>
and
if
I
may
not
be
think
to
descend
too
low
for
your
ladyship
's
attention
(
for
,
as
to
myself
,
I
shall
,
I
hope
,
always
look
back
with
pleasure
to
what
I
be
,
in
order
to
increase
my
thankfulness
for
what
I
be
)
,
I
would
give
you
a
scene
of
resignation
,
and
contented
poverty
,
of
which
otherwise
you
can
hardly
have
a
notion
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
it
,
because
it
will
be
a
scene
of
nature
,
however
low
,
which
your
ladyship
love
,
and
it
shall
not
tire
you
by
its
length
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
upon
occasion
of
a
great
loss
and
disappointment
which
happen
to
my
dear
parent
;
for
though
they
be
never
high
in
life
,
yet
they
be
not
always
so
low
as
my
honoured
lady
find
them
,
when
she
take
me
.
<EOS>
My
poor
father
come
home
;
and
as
the
loss
be
of
such
a
nature
,
as
that
he
could
not
keep
it
from
my
mother
,
he
take
her
hand
,
and
say
,
after
he
have
acquaint
her
with
it
,
"
come
,
my
dear
,
let
us
take
comfort
,
that
we
do
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
We
leave
the
issue
to
Providence
,
as
we
ought
,
and
that
have
turn
it
as
it
please
;
and
we
must
be
content
,
though
not
favour
as
we
wish
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
business
be
,
our
lot
be
not
cast
for
this
life
.
<EOS>
let
us
resign
ourselves
to
the
Divine
will
,
and
continue
to
do
our
duty
,
and
this
short
life
will
soon
be
past
.
<EOS>
Our
trouble
will
be
quickly
overblown
;
and
we
shall
be
happy
in
a
well
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
my
dear
mother
throw
her
arm
about
his
neck
,
and
say
,
with
tear
,
"
God
's
will
be
do
,
my
dear
love
!
<EOS>
all
can
not
be
rich
and
happy
.
<EOS>
I
be
content
,
and
have
rather
say
,
I
have
a
poor
honest
husband
,
than
a
guilty
rich
one
.
<EOS>
what
signify
repine
:
let
the
world
go
as
it
will
,
we
shall
have
our
length
and
our
breadth
at
last
.
<EOS>
and
Providence
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
be
a
well
friend
to
our
good
girl
here
,
because
she
be
good
,
than
we
could
be
,
if
this
have
not
happen
,
"
point
to
me
,
who
,
then
about
eleven
year
old
(
for
it
be
before
my
lady
take
me
)
,
sit
weep
in
the
chimney
corner
,
over
a
few
die
ember
of
a
fire
,
at
their
move
expression
.
  
<EOS>
I
arise
,
and
kiss
both
their
hand
,
and
bless
them
,
say
,
"
and
this
length
and
breadth
,
my
dear
parent
,
will
be
,
one
day
,
all
that
the
rich
and
the
great
can
possess
;
and
,
it
may
be
,
their
ungracious
heir
will
trample
upon
their
ashe
,
and
rejoice
they
be
go
:
while
such
a
poor
girl
as
I
,
be
honour
the
memory
of
mine
,
who
,
in
their
good
name
,
and
good
lesson
,
will
have
leave
me
the
good
of
portion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
they
both
hug
me
to
their
fond
bosom
,
by
turn
;
and
all
three
be
fill
with
comfort
in
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
farth
proof
that
honest
poverty
be
not
such
a
deplorable
thing
as
some
people
imagine
,
let
me
ask
,
what
pleasure
can
those
over
-
happy
person
know
,
who
,
from
the
luxury
of
their
taste
,
and
their
affluent
circumstance
,
always
eat
before
they
be
hungry
,
and
drink
before
they
be
thirsty
?
<EOS>
this
may
be
illustrate
by
the
instance
of
a
certain
eastern
monarch
,
who
,
as
I
have
read
,
march
at
the
head
of
a
vast
army
,
through
a
wide
extended
desert
,
which
afford
neither
river
nor
spring
,
for
the
first
time
,
find
himself
(
in
common
with
his
soldier
)
overtake
by
a
crave
thirst
,
which
make
him
pant
after
a
cup
of
water
.
<EOS>
and
when
,
after
diligent
search
,
one
of
his
soldier
find
a
little
dirty
puddle
,
and
carry
him
some
of
the
filthy
water
in
his
nasty
helmet
,
the
monarch
greedily
swallow
it
,
cry
out
,
that
in
all
his
life
he
never
taste
so
sweet
a
draught
!
  
<EOS>
but
when
I
talk
or
write
of
my
worthy
parent
,
how
I
run
on
!
 
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
my
good
lady
,
and
do
not
think
me
<EOS>
,
in
this
respect
,
too
much
like
the
cat
in
the
fable
,
turn
into
a
fine
lady
;
for
though
I
would
never
forget
what
I
be
,
yet
I
would
be
think
to
know
how
gratefully
to
enjoy
my
present
happiness
,
as
well
with
regard
to
my
obligation
to
God
,
as
to
your
dear
brother
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
proceed
to
your
ladyship
's
third
particular
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
<EOS>
and
you
can
not
imagine
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
how
much
you
have
set
my
heart
at
rest
,
when
you
say
,
that
my
dear
Mr.
B.
give
me
a
just
narrative
of
this
affair
with
Miss
Godfrey
:
for
when
your
ladyship
desire
to
know
how
he
have
recount
that
story
,
lest
you
should
make
a
misunderstanding
between
us
unaware
,
I
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
some
blood
have
be
shed
on
the
occasion
by
him
:
for
the
lady
be
ruin
,
and
as
to
her
,
nothing
could
have
happen
bad
.
<EOS>
the
regard
I
have
for
Mr.
B.
's
future
happiness
,
which
,
in
my
constant
supplication
for
him
in
private
,
cost
me
many
a
tear
,
give
me
great
apprehension
,
and
not
a
little
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
but
as
your
ladyship
tell
me
that
he
give
me
a
just
account
,
I
be
happy
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
come
to
your
ladyship
's
fourth
particular
.
  
<EOS>
and
highly
delighted
I
be
for
have
obtain
your
approbation
of
my
conduct
to
the
child
,
as
well
as
of
my
behaviour
towards
the
dear
gentleman
,
on
the
unhappy
lady
's
score
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
's
wise
intimation
about
have
the
child
with
me
,
make
due
impression
upon
me
;
and
I
see
in
them
,
with
grateful
pleasure
,
your
unmerited
regard
for
me
.
<EOS>
yet
,
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
I
have
conceive
a
strange
passion
for
this
dear
baby
;
I
can
not
but
look
upon
her
poor
mamma
as
my
sister
in
point
of
trial
;
and
shall
not
the
prosperous
sister
pity
and
love
the
poor
dear
sister
that
,
in
so
slippery
a
path
,
have
fall
,
while
she
have
the
happiness
to
keep
her
foot
?
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
your
ladyship
's
article
give
me
the
great
pleasure
and
satisfaction
;
and
if
I
can
but
continue
myself
in
the
favour
of
your
dear
brother
,
and
improve
in
that
of
his
noble
sister
,
how
happy
shall
I
be
!
<EOS>
I
will
do
all
I
can
to
deserve
both
.
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
will
take
as
an
instance
of
it
,
my
cheerful
obedience
to
your
command
,
in
write
to
so
fine
<EOS>
a
judge
,
such
crude
and
indigested
stuff
,
as
<EOS>
,
otherwise
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
lay
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
impatient
for
the
honour
of
your
presence
here
;
and
yet
I
perplex
myself
with
the
fear
of
appear
so
unworthy
in
your
eye
when
near
you
,
as
to
suffer
in
your
opinion
;
but
I
promise
myself
,
that
however
this
may
be
the
case
on
your
first
visit
,
I
shall
be
so
much
improve
by
the
benefit
I
shall
reap
from
your
lesson
and
good
example
,
that
whenever
I
shall
be
favour
with
a
second
you
shall
have
few
fault
to
find
with
me
;
till
,
as
I
shall
be
more
and
more
favoured
,
I
shall
in
time
be
just
what
your
ladyship
will
wish
me
to
be
,
and
,
of
consequence
,
more
worthy
than
I
be
of
the
honour
of
stile
myself
your
ladyship
's
most
humble
and
obedient
servant
,
P.B.

<EOS>
my
dear
MRS

<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
You
be
highly
obliging
in
express
so
warmly
your
wish
to
have
me
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
any
body
in
this
world
,
out
of
our
own
family
,
in
whose
company
I
should
be
happy
;
but
my
papa
will
not
part
with
me
,
I
think
;
though
I
have
secure
my
mamma
in
my
interest
;
and
I
know
Nancy
would
be
glad
of
my
absence
,
because
the
dear
,
perversely
envious
,
think
me
more
value
than
she
be
;
and
yet
,
foolish
girl
,
she
do
not
consider
,
that
if
her
envy
be
well
ground
,
I
should
return
with
more
than
double
advantage
to
what
I
now
have
,
improve
by
your
charming
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
My
papa
affect
to
be
in
a
fearful
pet
,
at
your
lecturing
of
him
so
justly
;
for
my
mamma
would
show
him
the
letter
;
and
he
say
he
will
positively
demand
satisfaction
of
Mr.
B.
for
your
treat
him
so
freely
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
shall
hardly
think
him
,
he
say
,
on
a
rank
with
him
,
unless
Mr.
B.
will
,
on
occasion
of
the
new
commission
,
take
out
his
Dedimus
:
and
then
if
he
will
bring
you
down
to
Lincolnshire
,
and
join
with
him
to
commit
you
prisoner
for
a
month
at
the
Hall
,
all
shall
be
well
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
obliging
in
Mr.
B.
to
join
in
your
kind
invitation
:
<EOS>
but
 
yet
I
be
loth
to
say
it
to
you
 
the
character
of
your
worthy
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
,
stand
a
little
in
the
way
with
my
papa
.
  
<EOS>
My
mamma
plead
his
be
married

<EOS>
"

"
what
of
all
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

but
,
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
hope
,
if
I
may
not
go
to
Bedfordshire
,
you
will
permit
me
to
go
to
London

when
Mrs.
B.
go

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

he
,
"
<EOS>
positively
no
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Sir
,
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
could
hope
,
however
,
you
would
enable
me
to
give
a
well
reason
to
good
Mrs.
B.
why
I
be
not
permit
to
accept
of
the
kind
invitation
,
than
that
<EOS>
which
I
understand
you
have
be
please
to
assign
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stick
his
hand
in
his
side
,
with
his
usual
humourous
positiveness
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
tell
her
she
be
a
very
saucy
lady
,
for
her
last
letter
to
you
,
and
her
lord
and
master
be
not
to
be
trust
;
and
it
be
my
absolute
will
and
pleasure
that
you
ask
me
no
more
question
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
very
faithfully
make
this
report
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
.
<EOS>
and
your
poor
Polly
Darnford
be
disappointed
of
one
of
the
great
pleasure
she
could
have
have
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
 
if
you
truly
pity
me
<EOS>
you
can
make
me
easy
under
the
disappointment
,
than
otherwise
possible
,
by
favour
me
with
an
epistolary
conversation
,
since
I
be
deny
a
personal
one
;
and
<EOS>
my
mamma
join
in
the
request
;
particularly
let
us
know
how
Lady
Davers
's
first
visit
pass
;
which
Mrs.
Peters
and
Mrs.
Jones
,
who
know
my
lady
<EOS>
so
well
,
likewise
long
to
hear
.
<EOS>
and
this
will
make
us
the
good
amend
in
your
power
for
the
loss
of
your
good
neighbourhood
,
which
we
have
all
promise
to
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
this
denial
of
my
papa
come
out
,
since
I
write
the
above
,
to
be
principally
owe
to
a
proposal
make
him
of
an
humble
servant
to
one
of
his
daughter
:
he
will
not
say
which
,
he
tell
us
,
in
his
usual
humourous
way
,
lest
we
should
fall
out
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
I
tell
him
,
"
the
young
gentleman
be
to
pick
and
choose
which
of
the
two
he
like
good
.
"
but
be
he
a
duke
,
'
tis
all
one
to
Polly
,
if
he
be
not
something
above
our
common
Lincolnshire
class
of
fox
-
hunters
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
shew
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Peters
your
letter
.
<EOS>
They
admire
you
beyond
expression
;
and
Mr.
Peters
say
,
he
do
not
know
,
that
ever
he
do
any
thing
in
his
life
,
that
give
him
so
much
inward
reproach
,
as
his
deny
you
the
protection
of
his
family
,
which
Mr.
Williams
seek
to
move
him
to
afford
you
,
when
you
be

at

before
Mr.

with
his
heart
bent
on
mischief

all
he
comfort
himself
with

,
that
very
denial
,
as
well
as
the
other
hardship
you
have
meet
with
,
be
necessary
to
bring
about
that
work
of
Providence
which
be
to
reward
your
unexampled
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
he
say
,
he
doubt
he
shall
not
be
think
excusable
by
you
,
who
be
so
exact
in
your
own
duty
,
<EOS>
since
he
have
the
unhappiness
to
lose
such
an
opportunity
to
have
do
honour
to
his
function
,
have
he
have
the
fortitude
to
have
do
his
;
and
he
have
beg
of
me
to
hint
his
concern
to
you
on
this
head
;
and
to
express
his
hope
,
that
neither
religion
nor
his
cloth
may
suffer
in
your
opinion
,
for
the
fault
of
one
of
its
professor
,
who
never
be
want
in
his
duty
so
much
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
it
often
upon
his
mind
,
he
say
,
to
write
to
you
on
this
very
subject
;
but
he
have
not
the
courage
;
and
besides
,
do
not
know
how
Mr.
B.
may
take
it
,
if
he
should
see
that
letter
,
as
the
case
have
such
delicate
circumstance
in
it
,
that
in
blame
himself
,
as
he
should
very
freely
have
do
,
he
must
,
by
implication
,
have
cast
still
great
blame
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
be
certainly
a
very
good
man
,
and
my
favourite
for
that
reason
;
and
I
hope
you
,
who
could
so
easily
forgive
the
late
wicked
,
but
now
penitent
Jewkes
,
will
overlook
with
kindness
a
fault
in
a
good
man
,
which
proceed
more
from
pusillanimity
and
constitution
,
than
from
want
of
principle
:
for
once
,
talk
of
it
to
my
mamma
,
before
me
,
he
accuse
himself
on
this
score
,
to
her
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
She
,
good
lady
,
would
have
give
you
this
protection
at
Mr.
Williams
's
desire
;
but
want
the
power
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
so
you
see
,
my

how
your

have
shame
every
one
into
such
a
sense
of
what

that
good

bad
,
and
indifferent

be
seek
to
make
excuse
for
past
misbehaviour

and
to
promise
future

like
penitent

after
some
unworthy
defection

<EOS>
from
Sir

to
Mr.

SIR
,
  
little
do
I
think
I
should
ever
have
occasion
to
make
a
formal
complaint
against
a
person
very
dear
to
you
,
and
who
I
believe
deserve
to
be
so
;
but
do
not
let
her
be
so
proud
and
so
vain
of
oblige
and
please
you
,
as
to
make
her
not
care
how
she
affront
every
body
else
.
  
<EOS>
the
person
be
no
other
than
the
wife
of
your
bosom
,
who
have
take
such
liberty
with
me
as
ought
not
to
be
take
,
and
seek
to
turn
my
own
child
against
me
,
and
make
a
dutiful
girl
a
rebel
.
  
<EOS>
if
people
will
set
up
for
virtue
,
and
all
that
,
let
'em
be
uniformly
virtuous
,
or
I
would
not
give
a
farthing
for
their
pretence
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
have
be
plague
with
gout
,
rheumatism
,
and
nameless
disorder
,
ever
since
you
leave
us
,
which
have
make
me
call
for
a
little
more
attendance
than
ordinary
;
and
I
have
reason
to
think
myself
slight
,
where
an
indulgent
father
can
least
bear
to
be
so
,
that
is
,
where
he
most
love
;
and
that
by
young
upstart
,
who
be
grow
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
those
pleasure
which
have
run
away
from
me
,
fleeting
rascal
as
they
be
!
<EOS>
before
I
be
willing
to
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
and
I
ring
and
rung
,
and
<EOS>
"
where
be
polly
?
"
<EOS>
(
for
I
honour
the
slut
with
too
much
of
my
notice
)
,
"
where
be
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
be
all
my
cry
,
to
every
one
who
come
up
to
ask
what
I
ring
for
.
<EOS>
and
,
at
last
,
in
burst
the
pert
baggage
,
with
an
air
of
assurance
,
as
if
she
think
all
must
be
well
the
moment
she
appear
,
with
"
do
you
want
me
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
want
you
,
confidence
?
<EOS>
yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
where
have
you
be
these
two
hour
,
that
you
never
come
near
me
,
when
you
know
'
twas
my
time
to
have
my
foot
rub
,
which
give
me
mortal
pain
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
you
must
understand
,
Mr.
B.
,
that
nobody
's
hand
be
so
soft
as
Polly
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
saucy
answer
,
as
I
be
dispose
to
think
it
,
because
I
have
just
then
a
twinge
,
that
I
could
scarce
bear
;
for
pain
be
a
plaguy
thing
to
a
man
of
my
lively
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
,
I
say
,
a
careless
answer
,
and
turn
upon
her
heel
;
and
not
come
to
me
at
my
first
word
,
I
fling
a
book
which
I
have
in
my
hand
,
at
her
head
.
<EOS>
and
,
this
fine
lady
of
your
'
,
this
paragon
of
meekness
and
humility
,
in
so
many
word
,
bid
me
,
or
,
which
be
bad
,
tell
my
own
daughter
to
bid
me
,
never
to
take
a
book
into
my
hand
again
,
if
I
will
not
make
a
well
use
of
it
:
 
and
yet
,
what
well
use
can
an
offend
father
make
of
the
good
book
,
than
to
correct
a
rebellious
child
with
them
,
and
oblige
a
saucy
daughter
to
jump
into
her
duty
all
at
once
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
reflect
upon
me
for
make
her
blush
formerly
,
and
say
thing
before
my
daughter
,
that
,
truly
,
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
?
<EOS>
then
avow
malice
and
revenge
.
<EOS>
why
neighbour
,
be
these
thing
to
be
bear
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
allow
your
lady
to
set
up
for
a
general
corrector
of
every
body
's
moral
but
your
own
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
allow
her
to
condemn
the
only
instance
of
wit
that
remain
to
this
generation
;
that
dear
polite
double
entendre
,
which
keep
alive
the
attention
,
and
quicken
the
apprehension
,
of
the
good
company
in
the
world
,
and
be
the
salt
,
the
sauce
,
which
give
a
poignancy
to
all
our
genteeler
entertainment
!
  
<EOS>
very
fine
,
truly
!
<EOS>
that
more
than
half
the
world
shall
be
shut
out
of
society
,
shall
be
preclude
their
share
of
conversation
amongst
the
gay
and
polite
of
both
sex
,
be
your
lady
to
have
her
will
!
<EOS>
let
her
first
find
people
who
can
support
a
conversation
with
wit
and
good
sense
like
her
own
,
and
then
something
may
be
say
:
<EOS>
but
till
then
,
I
positively
say
,
and
will
swear
upon
occasion
,
that
double
entendre
shall
not
be
banish
from
our
table
;
and
where
this
will
not
raise
a
blush
,
or
create
a
laugh
,
we
will
,
if
we
please
,
for
all
Mrs.

her

fangle
notion
,
force
the
one
and
the
other
by
still
plainer
hint
;
and
let
her
help
herself
how
she
can
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
Sir
,
you
find
my
complaint
be
of
a
high
nature
,
regard
the
quiet
of
a
family
,
the
duty
of
a
child
to
a
parent
,
and
the
freedom
and
politeness
of
conversation
;
in
all
which
your
lady
have
greatly
offend
;
and
I
insist
upon
satisfaction
from
you
,
or
such
a
correction
of
the
fair
transgressor
,
as
be
in
your
power
to
inflict
,
and
which
may
prevent
bad
consequence
from
your
offend
friend
and
servant
,
  
SIMON
DARNFORD

<EOS>
from
Mr.
B.
in
Answer
to
the
precede
one
.
  
<EOS>
dear
SIR
SIMON
,
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
but
believe
that
I
be
much
surprised
at
your
letter
,
complain
of
the
behaviour
of
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
could
no
more
have
expect
such
a
complaint
from
such
a
gentleman
,
than
I
could
,
that
she
would
have
deserve
it
:
and
I
be
very
sorry
on
both
account
.
<EOS>
I
have
talk
to
her
in
such
a
manner
,
that
,
I
dare
say
,
she
will
never
give
you
like
cause
to
appeal
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
,
that
the
criminal
herself
receive
it
from
her
servant
,
and
bring
it
to
me
in
my
closet
;
and
,
make
her
honour
(
for
I
can
not
say
<EOS>
but
she
be
very
obliging
to
me
,
though
she
take
such
saucy
freedom
with
my
friend
)
away
she
tript
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
inquire
for
her
,
when
,
with
surprise
,
as
you
may
believe
,
I
have
read
your
charge
,
find
she
be
go
to
visit
a
poor
sick
neighbour
;
of
which
indeed
I
know
before
because
she
take
the
chariot
;
but
I
have
forget
it
in
my
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
in
she
come
,
with
that
sweet
composure
in
her
face
which
result
from
a
consciousness
of
do
generally
just
and
generous
thing
.
<EOS>
I
resume
,
therefore
,
that
sternness
and
displeasure
which
her
entrance
have
almost
dissipate
.
<EOS>
I
take
her
hand
;
her
charming
eye
(
you
know
what
an
eye
she
have
,
Sir
Simon
)
quiver
at
my
overclouded
aspect
;
and
her
lip
,
half
draw
to
a
smile
,
tremble
with
apprehension
of
a
countenance
so
change
from
what
she
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
all
stiff
and
stately
as
I
could
look
,
do
I
accost
her
 
<EOS>
"
come
along
with
me
,
Pamela
,
to
my
closet
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
talk
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
I
do
?
<EOS>
let
me
know
,
good
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
look
round
,
with
her
half
-
affright
eye
,
this
way
and
that
,
on
the
book
,
and
picture
,
and
on
me
,
by
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
soon
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
crime
you
have
be
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Crime
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
 
<EOS>
this
closet
,
I
hope
,
would
not
be
a
second
time
witness
to
the
flutter
you
put
me
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
hang
a
tale
,
Sir
Simon
,
which
I
be
not
very
fond
of
relating
,
since
it
give
begin
to
the
triumph
of
this
little
sorceress
.
<EOS>
I
still
hold
one
hand
,
and
she
stand
before
me
,
as
criminal
ought
to
do
before
their
judge
,
but
say
,
"
I
see
,
Sir
,
sure
I
do
,
 
or
what
will
else
become
of
me
!
 
<EOS>
less
severity
in
your
eye
,
than
you
affect
to
put
on
in
your
countenance
.
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
let
me
but
know
my
fault
:
I
will
repent
,
acknowledge
,
and
amend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
great
presence
of
mind
,
Pamela
,
<EOS>
such
be
the
nature
of
your
fault
,
if
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
,
when
I
tell
it
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
let
me
,
"
say
the
irresistible
charmer
,
hide
her
face
in
my
bosom
,
and
put
her
other
arm
about
my
neck
,
"
let
me
thus
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
hide
this
guilty
face
,
while
I
hear
my
fault
tell
;
and
I
will
not
seek
to
extenuate
it
,
by
my
tear
,
and
my
penitence
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
hardly
hold
out
.
<EOS>
what
infatuate
creature
be
these
woman
,
when
they
thus
soothe
and
calm
the
tumult
of
an
angry
heart
!
<EOS>
when
,
instead
of
scornful
look
dart
in
return
for
angry
one
,
word
of
defiance
for
word
of
peevishness
,
persist
to
defend
one
error
by
another
,
and
return
vehement
wrath
for
slight
indignation
,
and
all
the
hostile
provocation
of
the
marriage
warfare
;
they
can
thus
hide
their
dear
face
in
our
bosom
,
and
wish
but
to
know
their
fault
,
to
amend
them
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
,
I
say
,
resist
the
sweet
girl
's
behaviour
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
believe
,
I
do
,
and
in
defiance
to
my
resolve
displeasure
,
press
her
forehead
with
my
lip
,
as
the
rest
of
her
face
be
hide
on
my
breast
;
but
,
consider
it
be
the
cause
of
my
friend
,
I
be
to
assert
,
my
injured
friend
,
wound
and
insult
,
in
so
various
a
manner
by
the
fair
offender
,
thus
haughtily
speak
I
to
the
tremble
mischief
,
in
a
pomp
of
style
theatrically
tragic
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
too
inadvertent
,

undistinguishe
Pamela

keep
you
long
in
suspense

for

ought

<EOS>
know

that

you
give

go
out

be
a

<EOS>
(

I

too
much

,
"
a

I
must
always
respect

I

express

whether
she

me
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
how
all
this
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
now
look
you
in
the
face
,
and
hear
all
that
Sir
Simon
can
charge
me
with
!
<EOS>
for
I
be
sure
,
I
have
not
so
affront
him
as
to
make
him
angry
indeed
.
<EOS>
and
truly
"
(
run
she
on
,
secure
of
pardon
as
she
seem
to
think
)
,
"
I
should
respect
Sir
Simon
not
only
as
your
friend
,
but
on
his
own
account
,
if
he
be
not
so
sad
a
rake
at
a
time
of
life
"
  
then
I
interrupt
her
,
you
must
needs
think
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
;
for
how
could
I
bear
to
hear
my
worthy
friend
so
freely
treat
!
<EOS>
"
how
now
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
;
"
and
be
it
thus
,
by
repeat
your
fault
,
that
you
atone
for
it
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
can
bear
to
hear
my
friend
so
freely
treat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
do
respect
Sir
Simon
very
much
as
your
friend
,
permit
me
to
repeat
;
but
can
not
for
his
wilful
failing
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
,
in
some
measure
,
to
approve
of
faulty
conversation
,
if
one
can
hear
it
,
and
not
discourage
it
,
when
the
occasion
come
in
<EOS>
so
pat
?
 
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
,
"
continue
she
,
"
to
give
him
a
little
rub
;
I
must
needs
own
it
:
but
if
it
displease
you
,
or
have
make
him
angry
in
earnest
,
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
and
will
be
less
bold
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
read
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
heavy
charge
,
and
I
will
return
instantly
to
hear
your
answer
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
go
from
her
,
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
but
,
would
you
believe
it
,
Sir
Simon
?
<EOS>
she
seem
,
on
my
return
,
very
little
concerned
at
your
just
complaint
.
<EOS>
what
self
-
justify
mind
have
the
meek
of
these
woman
!
 
<EOS>
instead
of
find
her
in
repentant
tear
,
as
one
would
expect
,
she
take
your
angry
letter
for
a
jocular
one
;
and
I
have
great
difficulty
to
convince
her
of
the
heinousness
of
her
fault
,
or
the
reality
of
your
resentment
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
be
determine
to
have
justice
do
to
my
friend
,
and
a
due
sense
of
her
own
great
error
impress
upon
her
,
I
begin
thus
:
  
"
Pamela
,
take
heed
that
you
do
not
suffer
the
purity
of
your
own
mind
,
in
breach
of
your
charity
,
to
make
you
too
rigorous
a
censurer
of
other
people
's
action
:
do
not
be
so
puff
up
with
your
own
perfection
,
as
to
imagine
,
that
,
because
other
person
allow
themselves
liberty
you
can
not
take
,
therefore
they
must
be
wicked
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
be
a
gentleman
who
indulge
himself
in
a
pleasant
vein
,
and
,
I
believe
,
as
well
as
you
,
have
be
a
great
rake
and
libertine
:
"
<EOS>
(
You
will
excuse
me
,
Sir
Simon
,
because
I
be
take
your
part
)
,
"
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
You
see
it
be
all
over
with
him
now
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
that
he
must
,
and
therefore
he
will
be
virtuous
:
and
be
a
man
for
ever
to
hear
the
fault
of
his
youth
,
when
so
willing
to
forget
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
Sir
,
"
say
the
bold
slut
,
"
can
you
say
he
be
willing
to
forget
them
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
not
repine
in
this
very
letter
,
that
he
must
forsake
them
;
and
do
he
not
plainly
cherish
the
inclination
,
when
he
own
<EOS>
"
She
hesitate
 
<EOS>
"
own
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
and
I
need
not
speak
it
:
and
can
there
well
be
a
more
censurable
character
?
 
<EOS>
then
before
his
maiden
daughter
!
<EOS>
his
virtuous
lady
!
<EOS>
before
any
body
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
sad
thing
be
this
,
at
a
time
of
life
,
which
should
afford
a
well
example
!
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
dear
Sir
,
"
continue
the
bold
prattler
,
(
take
advantage
of
a
silence
more
owing
to
displeasure
than
approbation
)
"
let
me
,
for
I
would
not
be
too
censorious
"
<EOS>
(
no
,
not
she
!
<EOS>
in
the
very
act
of
censoriousness
to
say
this
!
)
,
"
let
me
offer
but
<EOS>
one
thing
:
do
not
you
think
Sir
Simon
himself
would
be
loth
to
be
think
a
reform
gentleman
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
his
delight
,
when
speak
of
his
former
prank
,
as
if
sorry
he
could
not
play
them
over
again
?
<EOS>
see
but
how
he
simper
,
and
enjoy
,
as
one
may
say
,
the
relation
of
his
own
rakish
action
,
when
he
tell
a
bad
story
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
this
the
case
"
(
for
I
profess
,
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
,
I
be
at
a
grievous
loss
to
defend
you
)
,
"
for
you
to
write
all
these
free
thing
against
a
father
to
his
daughter
,
be
that
right
,
Pamela
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
the
good
gentleman
himself
have
take
care
,
that
such
a
character
as
I
presume
to
draw
to
Miss
of
her
papa
,
be
no
strange
one
to
her
.
<EOS>
You
have
see
yourself
,
Mr.
B.
,
whenever
his
arch
leer
,
and
his
humourous
attitude
on
those
occasion
,
have
teach
us
to
expect
some
shocking
story
,
how
his
lady
and
daughter
(
use
to
him
as
they
be
)
,
have
suffer
in
their
apprehension
of
what
he
would
say
,
before
he
speak
it
:
<EOS>
how
,
particularly
,
dear
Miss
Darnford
have
look
at
me
with
concern
,
desirous
,
as
it
be
,
if
possible
,
to
save
her
papa
from
the
censure
,
which
his
faulty
expression
must
naturally
bring
upon
him
.
<EOS>
and
,
dear
Sir
,
be
it
not
a
sad
thing
for
a
young
lady
,
who
love
and
honour
her
papa
,
to
observe
,
that
he
be
discredit
himself
,
and
want
the
example
he
ought
to
give
?
<EOS>
and
pardon
me
,
Sir
,
for
smile
on
so
serious
an
occasion
;
but
be
it
not
a
fine
sight
to
see
a
gentleman
,
as
we
have
often
see
Sir
Simon
,
when
he
have
think
proper
to
read
a
passage
in
some
bad
book
,
pull
off
his
spectacle
,
to
talk
filthily
upon
it
?
<EOS>
methink
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
,
"
add
the
bold
slut
,
"
split
his
arch
face
with
a
broad
laugh
,
shew
a
mouth
,
with
hardly
a
tooth
in
it
,
and
make
obscene
remark
upon
what
he
have
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
dear
saucy
-
face
laugh
out
,
to
bear
me
company
;
for
I
could
not
,
for
the
soul
of
me
,
avoid
laugh
heartily
at
the
figure
she
bring
to
my
mind
,
which
I
have
see
my
old
friend
more
than
once
make
,
with
his
dismount
spectacle
,
arch
mouth
,
and
gum
of
shine
jet
,
succeed
those
of
polished
ivory
,
of
which
he
often
boast
,
as
one
ornament
of
his
youthful
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
the
rather
in
my
heart
,
Sir
Simon
,
give
you
up
,
because
,
when
I
be
a
sad
fellow
,
it
be
always
my
maxim
to
endeavour
to
touch
a
lady
's
heart
without
wound
her
ear
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
find
my
account
sometimes
in
observe
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
resume
my
gravity
 
<EOS>
"
Hussy
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
do
you
think
I
will
have
my
old
friend
thus
make
the
object
of
your
ridicule
?
 
<EOS>
suppose
a
challenge
should
have
ensue
between
us
on
your
account
 
<EOS>
what
may
have
be
the
issue
of
it
?
<EOS>
to
see
an
old
gentleman
,
stump
,
as
he
say
,
on
crutch
,
to
fight
a
duel
in
defence
of
his
wounded
honour
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
bad
,
Sir
,
to
be
sure
:
I
see
that
,
and
be
sorry
for
it
:
for
have
you
carry
off
Sir
Simon
's
crutch
,
as
a
trophy
,
he
must
have
lain
sighing
and
groaning
like
a
wounded
soldier
in
the
field
of
battle
,
till
another
have
be
bring
him
,
to
have
stump
home
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Sir
Simon
,
I
have
bring
this
matter
to
an
issue
,
that
will
,
I
hope
,
make
all
easy
;
 
Miss
Polly
,
and
my
Pamela
,
shall
both
be
punish
as
they
deserve
,
if
it
be
not
your
own
fault
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
,
that
the
sin
of
your
youth
do
not
sit
so
heavily
upon
your
limb
,
as
in
your
imagination
;
and
I
believe
change
of
air
,
and
the
gratification
of
your
revenge
,
a
fine
help
to
such
lively
spirit
as
yours
,
will
set
you
up
.
<EOS>
You
shall
then
take
coach
,
and
bring
your
pretty
criminal
to
mine
;
and
when
we
have
them
together
,
they
shall
humble
themselves
before
us
,
and
you
can
absolve
or
punish
them
,
as
you
shall
see
proper
.
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
bear
to
have
my
worthy
friend
insult
in
so
heinous
a
manner
,
by
a
couple
of
saucy
girl
,
who
,
if
not
take
down
in
time
,
may
proceed
from
fault
to
fault
,
till
there
will
be
no
live
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
if
(
to
be
still
more
serious
)
<EOS>
your
lady
and
you
will
lend
Miss
Darnford
to
my
Pamela
's
wish
,
whose
heart
be
set
upon
the
hope
of
her
wintering
with
us
in
town
,
you
will
lay
an
obligation
upon
us
both
;
which
will
be
acknowledge
with
great
gratitude
by
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
your
affectionate
and
humble
servant
.
    
<EOS>
from
Sir
Simon
Darnford
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
 
a
word
in
your
ear
:
 
to
be
plain
:
I
like
neither
you
nor
your
wife
well
enough
to
trust
my
Polly
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
be
<EOS>
war
declare
against
my
poor
gum
,
it
seem
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
never
open
my
mouth
before
your
lady
as
long
as
I
live
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
for
these
ten
year
avoid
to
put
on
my
cravat
;
and
for
what
reason
,
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
because
I
could
not
bear
to
see
what
ruin
a
few
year
have
make
in
a
visage
,
that
use
to
inspire
love
and
terror
as
it
please
.
<EOS>
and
here
your
 
what
<EOS>
-
shall
-
I
-
call
-
her
of
a
wife
,
with
all
the
insolence
of
youth
and
beauty
on
her
side
,
follow
me
with
a
glass
,
and
would
make
me
look
in
it
,
whether
I
will
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
plaguy
<EOS>
good
-
humour
old
fellow
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
an
old
fellow
 
<EOS>
or
I
should
not
bear
the
insult
contain
in
your
letter
.
<EOS>
between
you
and
your
lady
,
you
make
a
wretched
figure
of
me
,
that
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
'
tis
take
my
part
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
must
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
be
glad
at
any
rate
to
stand
in
your
lady
's
grace
,
that
I
would
;
nor
would
I
be
the
last
rake
libertine
unreforme
by
her
example
,
which
I
suppose
will
make
virtue
the
fashion
,
if
she
go
on
as
she
do
.
<EOS>
but
here
I
have
be
use
to
cut
a
joke
and
toss
the
squib
about
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
it
have
help
to
keep
me
alive
in
the
midst
of
pain
and
ache
,
and
with
two
woman
-
grow
girl
,
and
the
rest
of
the
mortification
that
will
attend
on
advanced
year
;
for
I
will
not
(
hang
me
if
I
will
)
give
it
up
as
absolute
old
age
!
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
it
seem
,
I
must
leave
all
this
off
,
or
I
must
be
mortify
with
a
look
glass
hold
before
me
,
and
every
wrinkle
must
be
make
as
conspicuous
as
a
furrow
 
<EOS>
and
what
,
pray
,
be
to
succeed
to
this
reformation
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
neither
fast
nor
pray
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
and
besides
,
if
my
stomach
and
my
jest
depart
from
me
,
farewell
,
Sir
Simon
Darnford
!
  
<EOS>
but
can
not
I
pass
as
one
necessary
character
,
do
you
think
:
<EOS>
as
a
foil
(
as
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
some
of
your
own
action
have
be
to
your
lady
's
virtue
)
to
set
off
some
more
edifying
example
,
where
variety
of
character
make
up
a
feast
in
conversation
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
believe
I
may
have
trust
you
with
my
daughter
,
under
your
lady
's
eye
,
rake
as
you
have
be
yourself
;
and
fame
say
wrong
,
if
you
have
not
be
,
for
your
time
a
bold
sinner
than
ever
I
be
,
with
your
maxim
of
touch
lady
'
heart
,
without
wound
their
ear
,
which
make
sure
work
with
them
,
that
be
all
;
though
'
tis
to
be
hope
you
be
now
reform
;
and
if
you
be
,
the
whole
country
round
you
,
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
,
owe
great
obligation
to
your
fair
reclaimer
.
<EOS>
but
here
be
a
fine
prim
young
fellow
,
come
out
of
Norfolk
,
with
one
estate
in
one
county
,
another
in
another
,
and
jointure
and
settlement
in
his
hand
,
and
more
wit
in
his
head
,
as
well
as
more
money
in
his
pocket
,
than
he
can
tell
what
to
do
with
,
to
visit
our
polly
;
though
I
tell
her
I
much
question
the
former
quality
,
his
wit
,
if
he
be
for
marry
.
  
<EOS>
here
then
be
the
reason
I
can
not
comply
with
your
kind
Mrs.
B.
's
request
.
<EOS>
but
if
this
matter
should
go
off
;
if
he
should
not
like
her
,
or
she
him
;
or
if
I
should
not
like
his
term
,
or
he
mine
;
 
or
still
another
<EOS>
or
,
if
he
should
like
Nancy
better
why
,
then
perhaps
,
if
Polly
be
a
good
girl
,
I
may
trust
to
her
virtue
,
and
to
your
honour
,
and
let
her
go
for
a
month
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
when
I
have
say
this
,
and
when
I
say
,
further
,
that
I
can
forgive
your
severe
lady
,
and
yourself
too
,
(
who
,
however
,
be
less
to
be
excuse
in
the
air
you
assume
,
which
look
like
one
chimney
-
sweeper
call
another
a
sooty
rascal
)
<EOS>
I
give
a
proof
of
my
charity
,
which
I
hope
with
Mrs.
B.
will
cover
a
multitude
of
fault
;
and
the
rather
,
since
,
though
I
can
not
be
a
follower
of
her
virtue
in
the
strict
sense
,
I
can
be
an
admirer
of
it
;
and
that
be
some
little
merit
:
and
indeed
all
that
can
be
at
present
plead
by
yourself
,
I
doubt
,
any
more
than
your
humble
servant
,
  
SIMON
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
my
HONOURED
and
dear
parent
<EOS>
,
  
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
long
silence
,
which
have
be
owe
to
several
cause
,
and
have
have
nothing
new
to
entertain
you
with
:
and
yet
this
last
be
but
a
poor
excuse
to
you
,
who
think
every
trifling
subject
agreeable
from
your
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
I
daily
expect
here
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
.
<EOS>
this
give
me
no
small
pleasure
,
and
yet
it
be
mingle
with
some
uneasiness
at
time
;
lest
I
should
not
,
when
view
so
intimately
near
,
behave
myself
answerably
to
her
ladyship
's
expectation
.
<EOS>
but
I
resolve
not
to
endeavour
to
move
out
of
the
sphere
of
my
own
capacity
,
in
order
to
emulate
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
advantage
,
by
conversation
,
as
well
as
education
,
which
it
would
be
arrogance
in
me
to
assume
,
or
to
think
of
imitate
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
I
will
attempt
to
do
,
therefore
,
shall
be
,
to
shew
such
a
respectful
obligingness
to
my
lady
,
as
shall
be
consistent
with
the
condition
to
which
I
be
raise
;
so
that
she
may
not
have
reason
to
reproach
me
of
pride
in
my
exaltation
,
nor
her
dear
brother
to
rebuke
me
for
meanness
in
condescending
:
and
,
as
to
my
family
arrangement
,
I
be
the
less
afraid
of
inspection
,
because
,
by
the
natural
bias
of
my
own
mind
,
I
bless
God
,
I
be
above
dark
reserve
,
and
have
not
one
selfish
or
sordid
view
,
to
make
me
wish
to
avoid
the
most
scrutinising
eye
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
begin
a
correspondence
with
Miss
Darnford
,
a
young
lady
of
uncommon
merit
.
<EOS>
but
yet
you
know
her
character
from
my
former
writing
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
solicitous
to
hear
of
all
that
concern
me
,
and
particularly
how
Lady
Davers
and
I
agree
together
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
from
the
moment
I
see
her
first
;
for
she
have
the
least
pride
,
and
the
most
benevolence
and
solid
thought
,
I
ever
know
in
a
young
lady
,
and
do
not
envy
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
shall
write
to
her
often
:
and
as
I
shall
have
so
many
avocation
besides
to
fill
up
my
time
,
I
know
you
will
excuse
me
,
if
I
procure
from
this
lady
the
return
of
my
letter
to
her
,
for
your
perusal
,
and
for
the
entertainment
of
your
leisure
hour
.
<EOS>
this
will
give
you
,
from
time
to
time
,
the
account
<EOS>
you
desire
of
all
that
happen
here
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
what
relate
to
our
own
particular
,
I
beg
you
will
never
spare
writing
,
as
I
shall
not
answer
;
for
it
be
one
of
my
great
delight
,
that
I
have
such
worthy
parent
(
as
I
hope
in
God
,
I
long
shall
)
to
bless
me
and
to
correspond
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
paper
I
send
herewith
will
afford
you
some
diversion
,
particularly
those
relate
to
Sir
Simon
Darnford
;
and
I
must
desire
,
that
when
you
have
peruse
them
(
as
well
as
what
I
shall
send
for
the
future
)
,
you
will
return
them
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
greatly
please
me
,
on
his
last
return
,
in
his
account
of
your
health
,
and
the
satisfaction
you
take
in
your
happy
lot
;
and
I
must
recite
to
you
a
brief
conversation
on
this
occasion
,
<EOS>
which
,
I
dare
say
,
will
please
you
as
much
as
it
do
me
.
  
<EOS>
after
have
adjust
some
affair
with
his
dear
principal
,
which
take
up
two
hour
,
my
good
beloved
send
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
he
,
seat
me
by
him
,
and
make
the
good
old
gentleman
sit
down
,
(
for
he
will
always
rise
at
my
approach
)
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
and
I
have
settle
,
in
two
hour
,
some
account
,
which
would
have
take
up
as
many
month
with
some
person
:
for
never
be
there
an
exacter
or
more
methodical
accomptant
.
<EOS>
He
give
me
(
greatly
to
my
satisfaction
,
because
I
know
it
will
delight
you
)
an
account
of
the
kentish
concern
,
and
of
the
pleasure
your
father
and
mother
take
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
my
charmer
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
see
your
eye
begin
to
glisten
:
<EOS>
o
how
this
subject
raise
your
whole
soul
to
the
window
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
never
be
so
dutiful
<EOS>
a
daughter
,
Mr.
Longman
;
and
never
do
parent
better
deserve
a
daughter
's
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
endeavour
before
Mr.
Longman
to
rein
in
a
gratitude
,
that
my
throb
heart
confess
through
my
handkerchief
,
as
I
perceive
:
but
the
good
old
gentleman
could
not
hinder
his
from
shew
itself
at
his
worthy
eye
,
to
see
how
much
I
be
favour
 
oppress
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
 
with
the
tender
goodness
to
me
,
and
kind
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
"
say
he
,
wipe
his
cheek
:
"
my
delight
to
see
such
merit
so
justly
reward
will
not
be
contain
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
he
arise
and
walk
to
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
good
Mr.
Longman
,
"
say
I
,
as
he
return
towards
us
,
"
you
give
me
the
pleasure
to
know
that
my
father
and
mother
be
well
;
and
happy
then
they
must
be
,
in
a
goodness
and
bounty
,
that
I
,
and
many
more
,
rejoice
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
and
happy
,
Madam
;
 
ay
,
that
they
be
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
a
worthy
couple
never
live
.
<EOS>
most
nobly
do
they
go
on
in
the
farm
.
<EOS>
Your
honour
be
one
of
the
happy
gentleman
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
all
the
good
you
do
,
return
upon
you
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
It
may
well
be
say
you
cast
your
bread
upon
the
water
;
for
it
presently
come
to
you
again
,
rich
and
heavy
than
when
you
throw
it
in
.
<EOS>
all
the
kentish
tenant
,
Madam

be
hugely
delighted
with
their
good
steward
:
every
thing
prosper
under
his
management
:
the
gentry
love
both
him
and
my
dame
;
and
the
poor
people
adore
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
run
Mr.
Longman
on
,
to
my
inexpressible
delight
,
you
may
believe
;
and
when
he
withdraw
"
'
Tis
an
honest
soul
,
"
say
my
dear
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
I
love
him
for
his
respectful
love
to
my
angel
,
and
his
value
for
the
worthy
pair
.
<EOS>
very
glad
I
be
,
that
every
thing
answer
their
wish
.
<EOS>
May
they
long
live
,
and
be
happy
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
dear
man
make
me
spring
to
his
arm
,
whenever
be
touch
this
string
:
for
he
speak
always
thus
kindly
of
you
;
and
be
glad
to
hear
,
he
say
,
that
you
do
not
live
only
to
yourself
;
and
now
and
then
add
,
that
he
be
as
much
satisfied
with
your
prudence
,
as
he
be
with
mine
;
that
parent
and
daughter
do
credit
to
one
another
:
and
that
the
praise
he
hear
of
you
from
every
mouth
,
make
him
take
as
great
pleasure
in
you
,
as
if
you
be
his
own
relation
.
<EOS>
how
delight
,
how
transport
rather
,
my
dear
parent
,
must
this
goodness
be
to
your
happy
daughter
!
<EOS>
and
how
could
I
forbear
repeat
these
kind
thing
to
you
,
that
you
may
see
how
well
every
thing
be
take
that
you
do
?
  
<EOS>
when
the
expect
visit
from
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
be
over
,
the
approach
winter
will
call
us
to
London
;
and
as
I
shall
then
be
near
to
you
,
we
may
oftener
hear
from
one
another
,
which
will
be
a
great
heightening
to
my
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
hear
such
an
account
of
the
immorality
which
person
may
observe
there
,
along
with
the
public
diversion
,
that
it
take
off
a
little
from
the
satisfaction
I
should
otherwise
have
in
the
thought
of
go
thither
.
<EOS>
for
,
they
say
,
quarrel
,
and
duel
,
and
gallantry
,
as
they
be
call
,
so
often
happen
in
London
,
that
those
enormity
be
hear
of
without
the
least
wonder
or
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
this
make
me
very
thoughtful
at
time
.
<EOS>
but
God
,
I
hope
,
will
preserve
our
dear
benefactor
,
and
continue
to
me
his
affection
,
and
then
I
shall
be
always
happy
;
especially
while
your
health
and
felicity
confirm
and
crown
the
delight
of
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
,
P.B.
    
my
dearest
child
,
  
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
improper
to
mention
ourselves
,
what
the
nature
of
the
kindness
be
,
which
we
confer
on
our
poor
neighbour
,
and
the
labour
people
,
lest
it
should
be
surmise
,
by
any
body
,
that
we
be
lavish
away
wealth
that
be
not
our
own
.
<EOS>
not
that
we
fear
either
your
honoured
husband
or
you
will
suspect
so
,
or
that
the
worthy
Mr.
Longman
would
insinuate
as
much
;
for
he
see
what
we
do
,
and
be
highly
pleased
with
it
,
and
say
he
would
make
such
a
report
of
it
as
you
write
he
do
.
<EOS>
what
we
do
be
in
small
thing
,
though
the
good
we
hope
from
them
be
not
small
perhaps
:
and
if
a
very
distressful
case
should
happen
among
our
poor
neighbour
,
require
any
thing
considerable
,
and
the
object
be
deserve
,
we
would
acquaint
you
with
it
,
and
leave
it
to
you
to
do
as
God
should
direct
you
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
you
be
very
happy
,
and
if
it
can
be
,
may
you
be
happy
still
!
<EOS>
yet
I
verily
think
you
can
not
be
more
happy
than
your
father
and
mother
,
except
in
this
one
thing
,
that
all
our
happiness
,
under
God
,
proceed
from
you
;
and
,
as
other
parent
bless
their
child
with
plenty
and
benefit
<EOS>
,
you
have
bless
your
parent
(
or
your
honoured
husband
rather
for
your
sake
)
with
all
the
good
thing
this
world
can
afford
.
  
<EOS>
Your
paper
be
the
joy
of
our
leisure
hour
;
and
you
be
kind
beyond
all
expression
,
in
take
care
to
oblige
us
with
them
.
<EOS>
We
know
how
your
time
be
take
up
,
and
ought
to
be
very
well
contented
,
if
but
now
<EOS>
and
then
you
let
us
hear
of
your
health
and
welfare
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
enough
with
such
a
good
daughter
,
that
you
have
make
our
life
comfortable
,
but
you
will
make
them
joyful
too
,
by
communicate
to
us
,
all
that
befal
you
:
<EOS>
and
then
you
write
so
piously
,
and
with
such
a
sense
of
God
's
goodness
to
you
,
and
intermix
such
good
reflection
in
your
writing
,
that
whether
it
be
our
partial
love
or
not
,
I
can
not
tell
,
but
<EOS>
,
truly
,
we
think
nobody
come
up
to
you
:
and
you
make
our
heart
and
eye
so
often
overflow
,
as
we
read
,
that
we
join
hand
in
hand
,
and
say
to
each
other
,
in
the
same
breath
 
"
bless
be
God
,
and
bless
be
you
,
my
love
,
"
 
"
for
such
a
daughter
,
"
say
the
one
 
<EOS>
"
for
such
a
daughter
,
"
say
the
other
 
<EOS>
"
and
she
have
your
own
sweet
temper
,
"
cry
<EOS>
i.
 
<EOS>
"
and
she
have
your
own
honest
heart
,
"
cry
she
:
<EOS>
and
so
we
go
on
,
bless
God
,
and
you
,
and
bless
your
spouse
,
and
ourselves
!
 
<EOS>
be
any
happiness
like
our
,
my
dear
daughter
?
  
<EOS>
We
be
really
so
enraptured
with
your
writing
,
that
when
our
spirit
flag
,
through
the
infirmity
of
year
,
which
hath
begin
to
take
hold
of
us
,
we
have
recourse
to
some
of
your
paper
:
 
"
come
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
I
,
"
what
say
you
to
a
banquet
now
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
so
I
read
although
it
be
on
a
Sunday
,
so
good
be
your
letter
;
and
you
must
know
<EOS>
,
I
have
copy
of
many
,
and
after
a
little
while
we
be
as
much
alive
and
brisk
,
as
if
we
have
no
nag
at
all
,
and
return
to
the
duty
of
the
day
with
double
delight
.
  
<EOS>
consider
then
,
my
dear
child
,
what
joy
your
writing
give
us
:
and
yet
we
be
afraid
of
oppress
you
,
who
have
so
much
to
do
of
other
kind
;
and
we
be
heartily
glad
you
have
find
out
a
way
to
save
trouble
to
yourself
,
and
rejoice
us
,
and
oblige
so
worthy
a
young
lady
as
Miss
Darnford
,
all
at
one
time
.
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
her
dear
goodness
,
and
notice
of
me
at
the
Hall
,
kindly
press
my
rough
hand
with
her
fine
hand
,
and
look
in
my
face
with
so
much
kindness
in
her
eye
!
 
<EOS>
what
good
people
,
as
well
as
bad
,
there
be
in
high
station
!
 
<EOS>
thank
God
there
be
;
<EOS>
else
our
poor
child
would
have
have
a
sad
time
of
it
too
often
,
when
she
be
oblige
to
step
out
of
herself
,
as
once
I
hear
you
phrase
it
,
into
company
you
could
not
live
with
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
what
shall
I
say
more
?
<EOS>
and
yet
how
shall
I
end
?
 
<EOS>
only
,
with
my
prayer
,
that
God

there
be
no

what

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
my
DEAREST
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
the
interest
I
take
in
everything
that
concern
you
,
make
me
very
importunate
to
know
how
you
approve
the
gentleman
,
whom
some
of
your
good
friend
and
well
-
wisher
have
recommend
to
your
favour
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
deserve
your
good
opinion
,
and
then
he
must
excel
most
of
the
unmarried
gentleman
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
Your
papa
,
in
his
humourous
manner
,
mention
his
large
possession
and
rich
;
but
be
he
as
rich
as
Croesus
,
he
should
not
have
my
consent
,
if
he
have
no
great
merit
;
though
that
be
what
the
generality
of
parent
look
out
for
first
;
and
indeed
an
easy
fortune
be
so
far
from
be
to
be
disregard
,
that
,
when
attend
with
equal
merit
,
I
think
it
ought
to
have
a
preference
give
to
it
,
supposing
affection
disengage
.
<EOS>
for
'
tis
certain
,
that
a
man
or
woman
may
stand
as
good
a
chance
for
happiness
in
marriage
with
a
person
of
fortune
,
as
with
one
who
have
not
that
advantage
;
and
notwithstanding
I
have
neither
rich
nor
descent
to
boast
of
<EOS>
,
I
must
be
of
opinion
with
those
who
say
,
that
they
never
know
any
body
despise
either
,
that
have
them
.
<EOS>
but
to
permit
rich
to
be
the
principal
inducement
,
to
the
neglect
of
superior
merit
,
that
be
the
fault
which
many
a
one
smart
for
,
whether
the
choice
be
their
own
,
or
impose
upon
them
by
those
who
have
a
title
to
their
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
saucy
body
,
may
some
who
have
not
Miss
Darnford
's
kind
consideration
for
her
friend
,
be
apt
to
say
,
who
be
thus
meanly
descend
,
nevertheless
presume
to
give
her
opinion
,
in
these
high
case
,
unasked
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
this
to
say
;
that
I
think
myself
so
entirely
divest
of
partiality
to
my
own
case
,
that
,
as
far
as
my
judgment
shall
permit
,
I
will
never
have
that
in
view
,
when
I
be
presume
to
hint
my
opinion
of
general
rule
.
<EOS>
for
,
most
surely
,
the
honour
I
have
receive
,
and
the
debasement
to
which
my
good
friend
have
subject
himself
,
have
,
for
their
principal
excuse
,
that
the
gentleman
be
entirely
independent
,
have
no
question
to
ask
,
and
have
a
fortune
sufficient
to
make
himself
,
as
well
as
the
person
he
choose
,
happy
,
though
she
bring
him
nothing
at
all
;
and
that
he
have
,
moreover
,
such
a
character
for
good
sense
,
and
knowledge
of
the
world
,
that
nobody
could
impute
to
him
any
other
inducement
,
but
that
of
a
noble
resolution
to
reward
a
virtue
he
have
so
frequently
,
and
,
I
will
say
,
so
wickedly
,
try
,
and
could
not
subdue
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
,
let
me
,
as
a
subject
very
pleasing
to
me
,
touch
upon
your
kind
mention
of
the
worthy
Mr.
Peters
's
sentiment
to
that
part
of
his
conduct
to
me
,
which
(
oppress
by
the
terror
and
apprehension
to
which
I
be
subject
)
once
I
censure
;
and
the
ready
,
as
I
have
so
great
an
honour
for
his
cloth
,
that
I
think
,
to
be
a
clergyman
,
and
all
that
be
compassionate
,
good
,
and
virtuous
,
be
the
same
thing
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
to
know
Mr.
Peters
,
I
have
a
high
opinion
of
his
worthiness
,
and
as
no
one
can
be
perfect
in
this
life
,
thus
I
think
to
myself
:
how
hard
be
then
my
lot
,
to
be
the
cause
of
stumble
to
so
worthy
a
heart
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
a
gentleman
,
one
who
know
,
and
practise
so
well
,
his
duty
,
in
every
other
instance
,
and
preach
it
so
efficaciously
to
other
,
must
have
be
one
day
sensible
,
that
it
would
not
have
mis
-
become
his
function
and
character
to
have
afford
that
protection
to
oppress
innocence
,
which
be
request
of
him
:
and
how
would
it
have
grieve
his
considerate
mind
,
have
my
ruin
be
complete
,
that
he
do
not
!
  
<EOS>
but
as
he
have
once
a
namesake
,
as
one
may
say
,
that
fail
in
a
much
great
instance
,
let
not
my
want
of
charity
exceed
his
fault
;
but
let
me
look
upon
it
as
an
infirmity
,
to
which
the
most
perfect
be
liable
;
I
be
a
stranger
to
him
;
a
servant
girl
carry
off
by
her
master
,
a
young
gentleman
of
violent
and
lawless
passion
,
who
,
in
this
very
instance
,
shew
how
much
in
earnest
he
be
set
upon
effect
all
his
vile
purpose
;
and
whose
heart
,
although
God
may
touch
,
it
be
not
probable
any
less
influence
<EOS>
could
.
<EOS>
then
he
be
not
sure
,
that
,
though
he
may
assist
my
escape
,
I
may
not
afterwards
fall
again
into
the
hand
of
so
determined
a
violator
:
and
that
difficulty
would
not
,
with
such
an
one
,
enhance
his
resolution
to
overcome
all
obstacle
.
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
may
think
,
that
the
person
,
who
be
move
him
to
this
worthy
measure
,
possibly
seek
to
gratify
a
view
of
his
own
,
and
that
while
endeavour
to
save
,
to
outward
appearance
,
a
virtue
in
danger
,
he
be
,
in
reality
,
only
help
another
to
a
wife
,
at
the
hazard
of
expose
himself
to
the
vindictiveness
of
a
violent
temper
,
and
a
rich
neighbour
,
who
have
power
as
well
as
will
to
resent
;
for
such
be
his
apprehension
,
entirely
groundless
as
it
be
,
though
not
improbable
,
as
it
may
seem
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
all
these
consideration
,
I
must
pity
,
rather
than
too
rigorously
censure
,
the
worthy
gentleman
,
and
I
will
always
respect
him
.
<EOS>
and
thank
him
a
thousand
time
,
my
dear
,
in
my
name
,
for
his
goodness
in
condescend
to
acknowledge
,
by
your
hand
,
his
infirmity
,
as
such
;
for
this
give
an
excellent
proof
of
the
natural
worthiness
of
his
heart
;
and
that
it
be
beneath
him
to
seek
to
extenuate
a
fault
,
when
he
think
he
have
commit
one
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
have
so
much
honour
for
the
clergy
of
all
degree
,
that
I
never
forget
in
my
prayer
one
article
,
that
God
will
make
them
shine
light
to
the
world
;
since
so
much
depend
on
their
ministry
and
example
,
as
well
with
respect
to
our
public
as
private
duty
.
<EOS>
nor
shall
the
fault
of
a
few
make
impression
upon
me
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
order
;
for
I
be
afraid
a
very
censorious
temper
,
in
this
respect
,
be
too
generally
the
indication
of
an
uncharitable
and
perhaps
a
profligate
heart
,
level
character
,
in
order
to
cover
some
inward
pride
,
or
secret
enormity
,
which
they
be
ashamed
to
avow
,
and
will
not
be
instruct
to
amend
.
  
<EOS>
forgive
,
my
dear
,
this
tedious
scribble
;
I
can
not
for
my
life
write
short
letter
to
those
I
love
.
<EOS>
and
let
me
hope
that
you
will
favour
me
with
an
account
of
your
new
affair
,
and
how
you
proceed
in
it
;
and
with
such
of
your
conversation
,
as
may
give
me
some
notion
of
a
polite
courtship
.
<EOS>
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
your
poor
friend
know
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
all
her
courtship
be
sometimes
a
hasty
snatch
of
the
hand
,
a
black
and
blue
gripe
of
the
arm
,
and
 
<EOS>
"
Whither
now

"
 
<EOS>

come
to
me

I

I
will
!
 
<EOS>
Good
Sir

"
<EOS>
at
other

a

with
uplift

,
bent

tearful
eye
 
<EOS>

for

"
  
<EOS>
this
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
be
the
hard
treatment
that
attend
my
courtship
 
<EOS>
pray
,
then
,
let
me
know
,
how
gentleman
court
their
equal
in
degree
;
how
they
look
when
they
address
you
,
with
their
knee
bent
,
sigh
,
supplicate
,
and
all
that
,
as
Sir
Simon
say
,
with
the
word
Slave
,
Servant
,
Admirer
,
continually
at
their
tongue
's
end

<EOS>
but
after
all
,
it
will
be
find
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
that
be
the
language
and
behaviour
ever
so
obsequious
,
it
be
all
design
to
end
alike
 
<EOS>
the
English
,
the
plain
English
,
of
the
polite
address

be

<EOS>
"
I

dear
Madam

your
humble
servant

pray
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
be
your
master

"
 
"
<EOS>
yes

and
thank
you
too
,
"
say
the
lady
's
heart
,
though
not
her
lip
,
if
she
like
him
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
go
to
church
together
;
and
,
in
conclusion
,
it
will
be
happy
,
if
these
obsequious
courtship
end
no
bad
than
my
frightful
one
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
convince
,
that
with
a
man
of
sense
,
a
woman
of
tolerable
prudence
must
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
that
whenever
you
marry
,
it
may
be
to
such
a
man
,
who
then
must
value
you
as
you
deserve
,
and
make
you
happy

I
now

We

Mr.

have

He
be
a
lively
gentleman
,
well
enough
in
his
person
,
have
a
tolerable
character
,
yet
love
company
,
and
will
take
his
bottle
freely
;
my
papa
like
him
ne'er
the
bad
for
that
:
he
talk
a
good
deal
;
dress
gay
,
and
even
richly
,
and
seem
to
like
his
own
person
<EOS>
very
well
 
<EOS>
no
great
pleasure
this
for
a

he
fall
far
short
of

genteel
ease

distinguish
your

I

He
laugh

must
be
saucy
,
"
say
Sir
Simon
,
"
because
the
man
offer
himself
to
your
acceptance
.
<EOS>
a
few
year
hence
,
perhaps
,
if
you
remain
single
,
you
will
alter
your
note
,
Polly
,
and
be
willing
to
jump
at
a
much
less
worthy
tender
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
answer
that
,
although
I
pay
due
honour
to
all
my
papa
<EOS>
be
pleased
to
say
,
I
could
not
but
hope
he
would
be
mistake
in
this
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
break
my
mind
to
my
dear
mamma
,
who
tell
me
,
she
will
do
me
all
the
pleasure
she
can
;
but
would
be
loth
the
young
daughter
should
go
first
,
as
she
call
it
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
could
come
and
live
with
you
a
little
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
do
not
care
who
marry
,
unless
such
an
one
offer
as
I
never
expect
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
great
hope
the
gentleman
will
be
easily
persuade
to
quit
me
for
Nancy
;
for
I
see
he
have
not
delicacy
enough
to
love
with
any
great
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
as
my
mamma
tell
me
by
the
bye
,
that
I
be
the
handsome
,
and
best
humoured
,
and
he
have
find
out
as
he
think
,
that
I
have
some
wit
,
and
have
ease
and
freedom
(
and
he
tack
innocence
to
them
)
in
my
address
and
conversation
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
well
for
me
,
he
be
of
this
opinion
:
for
if
he
think
justly
,
which
I
must
question
,
any
body
may
think
so
still
much
more
;
for
I
have
be
far
from
take
pain
to
engage
his
good
word
,
have
be
under
more
reserve
to
him
,
than
ever
I
be
before
to
any
body
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
can
not
help
it
:
for
the
gentleman
be
forward
without
delicacy
;
and
(
pardon
me
,
Sir
Simon
)
<EOS>
my
papa
have
not
one
bit
of
it
neither
;
but
be
for
push
matter
on
,
with
his
rough
raillery
,
that
put
me
out
of
countenance
,
and
have
already
adjust
the
sordid
part
of
the
preliminary
,
as
he
tell
me
.
  
<EOS>
yet
I
hope
Nancy
's
three
thousand
pound
fortune
more
than
I
be
likely
to
have
,
will
give
her
the
wish
-
for
preference
with
Mr.
Murray
;
and
then
,
as
to
a
brother
-
in
-
law
,
in
prospect
,
I
can
put
off
all
restraint
,
and
return
to
my
usual
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
that
occur
worthy
of
notice
from
us
:
but
from
you
,
we
expect
an
account
of
Lady
Davers
's
visit
,
and
of
the
conversation
that
offer
among
you
;
and
you
have
so
delightful
a
way
of
make
every
thing
momentous
,
either
by
your
subject
or
reflection
,
or
both
,
that
we
long
for
every
post
-
day
,
in
hope
of
the
pleasure
of
a
letter
.
<EOS>
and
yours
I
will
always
carefully
preserve
,
as
so
many
testimony
of
the
honour
I
receive
in
this
correspondence
:
which
will
be
always
esteem
as
it

their

<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
I
mention
before
.
<EOS>
He
continue
to
give
a
very
good
account
of
poor
Jewkes
;
and
be
much
pleased
with
her
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
at
your
desire
,
and
to
oblige
your
honour
mamma
,
and
your
good
neighbour
,
I
will
now
acquaint
you
with
the
arrival
of
Lady
Davers
,
and
will
occasionally
write
what
pass
among
us
,
I
will
not
say
worthy
of
notice
;
for
be
I
only
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
more
brief
,
perhaps
,
by
much
,
than
you
seem
to
expect
.
<EOS>
but
as
my
time
be
pretty
much
take
up
,
and
I
find
I
shall
be
oblige
to
write
a
bit
now
,
and
a
bit
then
,
you
must
excuse
me
,
if
I
dispense
with
some
form
,
which
I
ought
to
observe
,
when
I
write
to
one
I
so
dearly
love
;
and
so
I
will
give
it
<EOS>
journal
-
wise
,
as
it
be
,
and
have
no
regard
,
when
it
would
fetter
or
break
in
upon
my
freedom
of
narration
,
to
inscription
or
subscription
;
but
send
it
as
I
have
opportunity
,
and
if
you
please
to
favour
me
so
far
,
as
to
lend
it
me
,
after
you
have
read
the
stuff
,
for
the
perusal
of
my
father
and
mother
,
to
whom
my
duty
,
and
promise
require
me
to
give
an
account
of
my
proceeding
,
it
will
save
me
transcription
,
for
which
I
shall
have
no
time
;
and
then
you
will
excuse
blot
and
blur
,
and
I
will
trouble
myself
no
farther
for
apology
on
that
score
,
but
this
once
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
think
it
worth
while
when
they
have
read
it
,
you
shall
have
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
WEDNESDAY
morning
,
SIX
O'CLOCK
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
dear
friend
permit
me
to
rise
an
hour
sooner
than
usual
,
that
I
may
have
time
to
scribble
;
for
he
be
always
pleased
to
see
me
so
employed
,
or
in
reading
;
often
say
,
when
I
be
at
my
needle
,
(
as
his
sister
once
write
)
"
Your
maid
can
do
this
,
Pamela
:
but
they
can
not
write
as
you
can
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
he
say
,
when
I
choose
to
follow
my
needle
,
as
a
diversion
from
too
intense
study
,
<EOS>
(
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
study
be
,
as
may
be
easily
guess
by
my
hasty
writing
,
put
down
every
thing
as
it
come
)
<EOS>
I
shall
then
do
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
but
I
promise
at
set
out
,
what
a
good
wife
<EOS>
I
would
endeavour
to
make
:
and
every
honest
body
should
try
to
be
as
good
as
her
word
,
you
know
,
and
such
particular
as
I
then
mention
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
ought
to
dispense
with
as
little
as
possible
;
especially
as
I
promise
no
more
than
what
be
my
duty
to
perform
,
if
I
have
not
promise
.
<EOS>
but
what
a
preamble
be
here
?
<EOS>
Judge
by
it
<EOS>
what
impertinence
you
may
expect
as
I
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
yesterday
evening
arrive
here
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
their
nephew
,
and
the
Countess
of
C.
,
mother
of
Lady
Betty
,
whom
we
do
not
expect
,
but
take
it
for
the
great
favour
.
<EOS>
It
seem
her
ladyship
long
,
as
she
say
,
to
see
me
;
and
this
be
her
principal
inducement
.
<EOS>
the
two
lady
,
and
their
two
woman
,
be
in
Lord
Davers
's
coach
and
six
,
and
my
lord
and
his
nephew
ride
on
horseback
,
attend
with
a
train
of
servant
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
expect
them
to
dinner
;
but
they
could
not
reach
time
enough
;
for
the
countess
be
a
little
incommode
with
her
journey
,
the
coach
travel
slowly
.
<EOS>
My
lady
would
not
suffer
her
lord
,
nor
his
nephew
,
to
come
hither
before
her
,
though
on
horseback
,
because
she
would
be
present
,
she
say
,
when
his
lordship
first
see
me
,
he
have
quite
forget
her
mother
's
Pamela
;
that
be
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
It
rain
when
they
come
in
;
so
the
coach
drive
directly
to
the
door
,
and
Mr.
B.
receive
them
there
;
but
I
be
in
a
little
sort
of
flutter
,
which
Mr.
B.
observe
,
make
me
sit
down
in
the
parlour
to
compose
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
where
be
Pamela
?
"
say
my
lady
,
as
soon
as
she
alight
.
  
<EOS>
I
stept
out
,
lest
she
should
take
it
amiss
:
<EOS>
and
she
take
my
hand
,
and
kiss
me
:
"
<EOS>
here
,
my
lady
countess
,
"
say
she
,
present
me
to
her
,
"
here
be
the
girl
;
see
if
I
say
too
much
in
praise
of
her
person
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
countess
salute
me
with
a
visible
pleasure
in
her
eye
,
and
say
,
"
indeed
,
Lady
Davers
,
you
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
'
twould
have
be
strange
(
excuse
me
,
Mrs.
B.
,
for
I
know
your
story
)
,
if
such
a
fine
flower
have
not
be
transplant
from
the
field
to
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
return
,
but
by
a
low
curtsey
,
to
her
ladyship
's
compliment
.
<EOS>
then
Lady
Davers
take
my
hand
again
,
present
me
to
her
lord
:
"
see
here
,
my
lord
,
my
mother
's
Pamela
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
see
here
,
my
lord
,
"
say
her
generous
brother
,
take
my
other
hand
most
kindly
,
"
see
here
your
brother
's
Pamela
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
lord
salute
me
:
"
I
do
,
"
say
he
to
his
lady
,
and
to
his
brother
;
"
and
I
see
the
first
person
in
her
,
that
have
exceed
my
expectation
,
when
every
mouth
have
prepare
me
to
expect
a
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
,
whom
every
one
call
Lord
Jackey
,
after
his
aunt
's
example
,
when
she
be
in
good
humour
with
him
,
and
who
be
a
very
young
gentleman
,
though
about
as
old
as
my
good
friend
,
come
to
me
next
,
and
say
,
"
lovelier
and
lovelier
,
by
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
your
peer
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
me
,
my
dear
,
all
this
seem
vanity
,
for
the
sake
of
repeat
exactly
what
pass
?
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
"
say
my
lady
,
take
my
hand
,
in
her
free
quality
way
,
which
quite
dash
me
,
and
hold
it
at
a
distance
,
and
turn
me
half
round
,
her
eye
fix
to
my
waist
,
"
let
me
observe
you
a
little
,
my
sweet
-
faced
girl
;
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
be
right
<EOS>
:
I
hope
you
will
do
credit
to
my
brother
,
as
he
have
do
you
credit
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
let
her
lace
so
tight
,
Mr.
B.
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
unable
to
look
up
,
as
you
may
believe
,
Miss
:
<EOS>
my
face
,
all
over
scarlet
,
be
hide
in
my
bosom
,
and
I
look
so
silly
!
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
my
naughty
lady
,
"
you
may
well
look
down
,
my
good
girl
:
for
work
of
this
nature
will
not
be
long
hide

<EOS>
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
my
lady
,
"
(
to
the
countess
)
"
see
how
like
a
pretty
thief
she
look
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
my
lady
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
:
<EOS>
for
she
still
keep
look
at
me
:
and
<EOS>
her
good
brother
,
see
my
confusion
,
in
pity
to
me
,
press
my
blushing
<EOS>
face
a
moment
to
his
generous
breast
,
and
say
,
"
Lady
Davers
,
you
should
not
be
thus
hard
upon
my
dear
girl
,
the
moment
you
see
her
,
and
before
so
many
witness
:
 
but
look
up
,
my
good
love
,
take
your
revenge
of
my
sister
,
and
tell
her
,
you
wish
her
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
then
?
"
say
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
love
you
better
and
better
:
but
I
almost
doubt
it
,
see
her
still
so
slender
.
<EOS>
but
if
,
my
good
child
,
you
lace
too
tight
,
I
will
never
forgive
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
she
give
me
a
kiss
of
congratulation
,
as
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
do
not
look
very
silly
?
<EOS>
My
lord
,
smile
,
and
gaze
at
me
from
head
to
foot
;
Lord
Jackey
grin
and
laugh
,
like
an
oaf
,
as
I
then
,
in
my
spite
,
think
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
countess
say
,
encouragingly
to
me
,
but
severely
in
person
of
birth
,
"
Lady
Davers
,
you
be
as
much
too
teaze
,
as
Mrs.
B.
be
too
bashful
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
a
happy
man
,
Mr.
B.
,
that
your
lady
's
bashfulness
be
the
principal
mark
by
which
we
can
judge
she
be
not
of
quality
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Jackey
,
in
the
language
of
some
character
in
a
play
,
cry
out
,
"
a
palpable
hit
,
by
Jupiter
!
"
and
laugh
egregiously
,
run
about
from
one
to
another
,
repeat
the
same
word
.
  
<EOS>
We
talk
only
upon
common
topic
till
supper
-
time
,
and
I
be
all
ear
,
as
I
think
it
become
me
to
be
;
for
the
countess
have
,
by
her
first
compliment
,
and
by
an
aspect
as
noble
as
intelligent
,
overawe
me
,
as
I
may
say
,
into
a
respectful
silence
,
to
which
Lady
Davers
's
free
,
though
pleasant
raillery
(
which
she
could
not
help
carry
on
now
-
and
-
then
)
contribute
.
<EOS>
besides
,
Lady
Davers
's
letter
have
give
me
still
great
reason
to
revere
her
wit
and
judgment
than
I
have
before
,
when
I
reflect
on
her
passionate
temper
,
and
such
part
of
the
conversation
I
have
have
with
her
ladyship
in
your
neighbourhood
;
which
(
however
to
be
admire
)
fall
short
of
her
letter
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
to
sit
down
at
table
,
I
look
,
I
suppose
,
a
little
diffidently
:
for
I
really
then
think
of
my
lady
's
anger
at
the
Hall
,
when
she
would
not
have
permit
me
to
sit
at
table
with
her
;
and
Mr.
B.
say
,
"
take
your
place
,
my
dear
;
you
keep
our
friend
stand
;
"
I
sit
down
in
my
usual
seat
.
<EOS>
and
my
lady
say
,
"
none
of
your
reproaching
eye
,
Pamela
;
I
know
what
you
hint
at
by
it
;
and
every
letter
I
have
receive
from
you
have
make
me
censure
myself
for
my
lady
-
air
,
as
you
call
'em
,
you
sauce
-
box
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
:
I
tell
you
,
I
would
lady
-
air
you
when
I
see
you
;
and
you
shall
have
it
all
in
good
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
shall
have
nothing
from
your

what
will
be
very
agreeable

<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
I
never
mean
any
thing
particular
by
that
,
or
any
other
word
that
I
write
;
nor
could
I
think

what

highly
respectful

<EOS>
Lord

be
pleased
to
say

that
it

impossible
I

either

<EOS>
Lady

after

,
"
brother
,
I
think
you
should
hold
yourself

to
my
Lord
Davers
;
for
he
have
speak
to
Lord
S.
who
make
him
a
visit
a
few
day
ago
,
to
procure
you
a
baronet
's
patent
.
<EOS>
Your
estate
,
and
the
figure
you
make
in
the
world
,
be
so
considerable
,
and
your
family
besides
be
so
ancient
,
that
,
methink
,
you
should
wish
for
some
distinction
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
brother
,
"
say
my
lord
,
"
I
do
mention
it
to
Lord
S.
and
tell
him
,
withal
,
that
it
be
without
your
knowledge
or
desire
that
I
speak
about
it
;
and
I
be
not
very
sure
you
would
accept
of
it
;
but
'
tis
a
thing
your
sister
have
wish
for
a
good
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
answer
do
my
Lord
S.
make
to
it
?
"
say
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
  
"
He
say
,
"
We
,
"
mean
the
minister
,
I
suppose
,
"
should
be
glad
to
oblige
a
man
of
Mr.
B.
's
figure
in
the
world
;
but
you
mention
it
so
slightly
,
that
you
can
hardly
expect
courtier
will
tender
it
to
any
gentleman
that
be
so
indifferent
about
it
;
for
,
Lord
Davers
,
we
seldom
grant
honour
without
a
view
:
I
tell
you
that
,
"
add
he
,
smile
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
S.
may
mention
this
as
a
jest
,
"
return
Mr.
B.
,
"
but
he
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
your
lordship
say
well
,
that
I
be
indifferent
about
it
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
true
,
'
tis
an
hereditary
title
;
but
the
rich
citizen
,
who
use
to
be
satisfied
with
the
title
of
Knight
,
(
till
they
make
it
so
common
,
that
it
be
bring
into
as
great
contempt
almost
as
that
of
the
french
knight
of
St.
Michael,[1
]
and
nobody
care
to
accept
of
it
)
<EOS>
now
be
ambitious
of
this
;
and
,
as
I
apprehend
,
it
be
hasten
apace
into
like
disrepute
.
<EOS>
besides
,
'
tis
a
novel
honour
,
and
what
the
ancestor
of
our
family
,
who
live
at
its
institution
,
would
never
accept
of
.
<EOS>
but
be
it
a
peerage
,
which
have
some
essential
privilege
and
splendour
annex
to
it
,
to
make
it
desirable
to
some
man
,
I
would
not
enter
into
condition
for
it
.
<EOS>
title
at
good
,
"
add
he
,
"
be
but
shadow
;
and
he
that
have
the
substance
should
be
above
value
them
;
for
who
that
have
the
whole
bird
,
would
pride
himself
upon
a
single
feather
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
say
my
lady
,
"
although
I
acknowledge
that
the
institution
be
of
late
date
,
yet
,
as
abroad
,
as
well
as

,
it
be
regard

of

I

wish
you

as
to

it

they

not

always
think
Mr.

steady
principle

not
attach

,
in

it

on

you
may
undoubtedly
keep
your

pay
your

accept

account

it

become

silent

I
should
be
against

perhaps
my

be
of

a

abash

It
be
this

here
my

disparage

seek

another

then
perhaps
,
it
will
be
attribute

they

whereas
,
have
I
such
a
vain
thought

it
would
be

make
it
the
more
remembered
against
both
Mr.

<EOS>
and
indeed
,
as
to
my

I
take

up

to
be

much
censure

this
would
not

prevent

of
opinion

out

THURSDAY
morning

SIX
O'CLOCK

<EOS>
Our
breakfast
conversation
yesterday
(
at
which
only
Mrs.
Worden
,
my
lady
's
woman
,
and
my
polly
attend
)
be
so
whimsically
particular
,
(
though
I
doubt
some
of
it
,
at
least
,
will
appear
too
trifling
)
that
I
must
acquaint
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
with
it
,
who
be
desirous
of
know
all
that
relate
to
Lady
Davers
's
conduct
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
then
,
I
have
the
honour
to
stand
very
high
in
the
grace
of
Lord
Davers
,
who
on
every
occasion
be
pleased
to
call
me
his
good
Sister
,
his
dear
Sister
,
and
sometimes
his
charming
Sister
,
and
he
say
,
he
will
not
be
out
of
my
company
for
an
hour
together
,
while
he
stay
here
,
if
he
can
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
seem
to
relish
this
very
well
in
the
main
,
though
she
can
not
quite
so
readily
,
yet
,
frame
her
mouth
to
the
sound
of
the
word
Sister
,
as
my
lord
do
;
of
which
this
that
follow
be
one
instance
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
call
me
by
that
tender
name
twice
before
,
and
say
,
"
I
will
drink
another
dish
,
I
think
,
my
good
Sister
.
<EOS>
"
My
lady
say
,
"
Your
lordship
have
get
a
word
by
the
end
,
that
you
seem
mighty
fond
of
:
I
have
take
notice
,
that
you
have
call
Pamela
Sister
,
Sister
,
Sister
,
no
less
than
three
time
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
lord
look
a
little
serious
:
"
I
shall
one
day
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
allow
to
choose
my
own
word
and
phrase
<EOS>
,
I
hope
 
Your
sister
,
Mr.
B.
,
"
add
he
,
"
often
question
whether
I
be
at
age
or
not
,
though
the
House
of
Peers
make
no
scruple
of
admit
me
among
them
some
year
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
say
severely
,
but
with
a
smile
air
,
"
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
she
have
such
a
gentleman
as
your
lordship
for
a
husband
,
whose
affectionate
indulgence
to
her
make
you
overlook
all
her
saucy
sally
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
when
you
take
her
out
of
our
family
into
your
own
,
we
all
think
ourselves
,
I
in
particular
,
bind
to
pray
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
this
a
great
trial
of
my
lady
's
patience
:
but
it
be
from
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
she
say
,
with
a
half
-
pleasant
,
half
-
serious
air
,
"
how
now
,
confidence
!
 
<EOS>
none
but
my
brother
could
have
say
this
,
whose
violent
spirit
be
always
much
more
intolerable
than
mine
:
but
I
can
tell
you
,
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
,
I
be
always
think
very
good
-
humour
and
oblige
to
every
body
,
till
your
impudence
come
from
college
,
and
from
your
travel
;
and
then
,
I
own
,
your
provoking
way
make
me
now
-
and
-
then
a
little
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
sister
,
we
will
have
no
more
of
this
subject
;
only
let
us
see
that
my
Lord
Davers
want
not
his
proper
authority
with
you
,
although
you
use
to
keep
me
in
awe
formerly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
keep
you
in
awe
!
 
<EOS>
that
nobody
could
ever
do
yet
,
boy
or
man
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
lord
,
I
beg
your
pardon
;
for
this
brother
will
make
mischief
betwixt
us
if
he
can
 
<EOS>
I
only
take
notice
of
the
word
Sister
so
often
use
,
which
look
more
like
affectation
than
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
Lady
Davers
,
"
say
my
lord
,
gravely
,
"
I
have
two
reason
for
use
the
word
so
frequently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
be
glad
to
hear
them
,
"
say
the
dear
taunting
lady
;
"
for
I
do
not
doubt
they
be
mighty
good
one
.
<EOS>
what
be
they
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
be
,
because
I
love
,
and
be
fond
of
my
new
relation
:
the
other
,
that
you
be
so
spare
of
the
word
,
that
I
call
her
so
for
us
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
say
well
,
"
reply
Mr.
B.
,
smile
:
"
and
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
can
give
two
reason
why
she
do
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
my
lady
,
"
now
we
be
in
for't
<EOS>
,
let
us
hear
your
two
reason
likewise
;
I
doubt
not
they
be
wise
one
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
they
be
yours
,
Lady
Davers
,
they
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
one
be
,
that
every
condescension
(
to
speak
in
a
proud
lady
's
dialect
)
come
with
as
much
difficulty
from
her
,
as
a
favour
from
the
House
of
Austria
to
the
petty
prince
of
Germany
.
<EOS>
the
second
,
because
those
of
your
sex
<EOS>
(
excuse
me
,
Madam
,
"
to
the
countess
)
"
who
have
once
make
scruple
,
think
it
inconsistent
with
themselves
to
be
over
hasty
to
alter
their
own
conduct
,
choose
rather
to
persist
in
an
error
,
than
own
it
to
be
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
proceed
from
his
impatience
to
see
me
in
the
least
slight
by
my
lady
;
and
I
say
to
Lord
Davers
,
to
soften
matter
,
"
never
,
my
lord
,
be
brother
and
sister
so
love
in
earnest
,
and
yet
so
satirical
upon
each
other
in
jest
,
as
my
good
lady
and
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
but
your
lordship
know
their
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
lady
frown
at
her
brother
,
but
turn
it
off
with
an
air
:
"
I
love
the
mistress
of
this
house
,
"
say
she
,
"
very
well
;
and
be
quite
reconcile
to
her
:
but
methink
there
be
such
a
hiss
sound
in
the
word
Sister
,
that
I
can
not
abide
it
.
'
<EOS>
tis
a
true
english
word
,
but
a
word
I
have
not
be
use
to
,
have
never
have
a
sis

ter
before
,
as
you
know

"
 
speak
the
first
syllable
of
the
word
with
an
emphatical
hiss
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
say
,
"
observe
you
not
,
Lady
Davers
,
that
you
use
a
word
(
to
avoid
that
)
which
have
twice
the
hissing
in
it
that

Excuse

(
to
the

such
poor
low

I

up

the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay

my
good

like

take
it
for

that
it

a
mark
of
good

so

for
this

sensible
body

I
will
leave
off

<EOS>
only
one

I
shall

afford
me

to

"
give

permit
me
to

I

I

why

<EOS>
Can
people

be
it
so
great
a
praise

Thou

I

"
<EOS>
Mr.

obey

Polly

out

for
you

that

none

fellow

to
attend
upon
us
at
tea

and
I
can
not

I

"

'
tis
less
wonder

although
in

thou
hadst
the
impudence

to
make
thy
attempt
before
Mrs.

in
spite
of
her
struggle
and
reproach

be
the
very
stretch
of
shameless
wickedness

Mr.

seem
a
little
disconcert

say
,

surely

Lady

this
be
go
too
far

<EOS>
look
at
Pamela

blush
face

downcast
eye

wonder
at
yourself
for
this
question

as
much
as
you
do
at

action
you

My

I
wonder
not

indeed

since

naturally

I
must
say

Mr.

that
we
have
all
,

my
daughter
too

wonder
at
this
,
more
than
at
any
part

your
attempt

because
,
Sir

we
think
you
one
of
the
most
civilized

that
you

appearance

You
may

the
triumph
be
your

the

the

ought

humour
my

me

"
Nay

Lady

"
you
know
the
question

I
can
not

it
strong

<EOS>

that
be
very
true

he
:
"

would
you

action
set
before
me
in
so
full
a
glare
,
in
presence
of
Lord
Davers
and
the
countess
;
yet
I
will
not
have
you
stir
because
I
forget
how
you
represent
it
,
and
you
must
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Sir
,
I
can
not
,
"
say
I
;
"
pray
,
my
dear
lady
 
pray
,
my
good
lord
 
<EOS>
and
,
dear
Sir
,
do
not
thus
renew
my
griefs
,
as
you
be
pleased
justly
to
phrase
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
representation
of
that
scene
in
my
pocket
,
"
say
my
lady
;
"
for
I
be
resolve
,
as
I
tell
Lady
Betty
,
to
shame
the
wicked
wretch
with
it
the
first
opportunity
;
and
I
will
read
it
to
you
;
or
rather
,
you
shall
read
it
yourself
,
bold
-
face
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
she
pull
those
leave
out
of
her
pocket
,
wrap
up
carefully
in
a
paper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
,
 
I
believe
he
who
could
act
thus
,
must
read
it
;
and
,
to
spare
Pamela
's
confusion
,
read
it
to
yourself
;
for
we
all
know
how
it
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
he
,
take
the
paper
,
"
I
can
say
something
to
abate
the
heinousness
of
this
heavy
charge
,
or
else
I
should
not
stand
thus
at
the
insolent
bar
of
my
sister
,
answer
her
interrogatory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
send
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
a
transcript
of
the
charge
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
you
will
say
,
he
be
a
very
wicked
man
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
read
it
to
himself
,
and
say
,
"
this
be
a
dark
affair
,
as
here
state
;
and
I
can
not
say
,
but
Pamela
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
too
,
have
great
reason
to
apprehend
the
bad
:
but
surely
reader
of
it
,
who
be
less
party
in
the
suppose
attempt
,
and
not
determined
at
all
event
to
condemn
me
,
may
have
make
a
more
favourable
construction
for
me
,
than
you
,
Lady
Davers
,
have
do
in
the
strong
light
in
which
you
have
set
this
heinous
matter
before
us

however
,
since
my
lady

bow
to
the
countess

Lord
Davers
seem
to
expect
me
particularly
to
answer
this
black
charge
,
I
will
,
at
a
proper
time
,
if
agreeable
,
give
you
a
brief
history
of
my
passion
for
this
dear
girl

how
it
commence
and
increase
,
and
my
own
struggle
with
it

this
will
introduce
,
with
some
little
advantage
to
myself
perhaps
,
what
I
have
to
say
,
as
to
this
suppose
attempt
:

at
the
same
time
enable
you
the
well
to
account
for
some
fact
which
you
have
read
in
my
pretty
accuser
's
paper
.

"
  
<EOS>
this
please
every
one
,

they
beg
him
to
begin
then
;
but
he
say
,
it
be
time
we
should
think
of
dressing
,
the
morning
be
far
advanced
;
and
if
no
company
come
in
,
he
would
,
in
the
afternoon
,
give
them
the
particular
they
desire
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
the
three
gentleman
ride
out
,
and
return
to
dress
before
dinner
:
my
lady
and
the
countess
also
take
an
airing
in
the
chariot
.
<EOS>
just
as
they
return
,
compliment
come
from
several
of
the
neighbouring
lady
to
our
noble
guest
,
on
their
arrival
in
these
part
;
and
to
as
many
as
send
,
Lady
Davers
desire
their
company
for
to
-
morrow
afternoon
,
to
tea
;
but
Mr.
B.
have
fall
in
with
some
of
the
gentleman
likewise
,
he
tell
me
,
we
should
have
most
of
our
visit
neighbour
at
dinner
,
and
desire
Mrs.
Jervis
may
prepare
accordingly
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
Mr.
H.
take
a
ride
out
,
attend
by
Mr.
Colbrand
,
of
whom
he
be
very
fond
,
ever
since
he
frighten
Lady
Davers
's
footman
at
the
Hall
,
threaten
to
chine
them
,
if
they
offer
to
stop
his
lady
:
for
,
he
say
,
he
love
a
man
of
courage
:
very
probably
know
his
own
defect
that
way
,
for
my
lady
often
call
him
a
chicken
-
hearte
fellow
.
<EOS>
and
then
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
the
countess
,
revive
the
subject
of
the
morning
;
and
Mr.
B.
be
pleased
to
begin
in
the
manner
I
shall
mention
by
-
and
-
bye
.
<EOS>
for
here
I
be
oblige
to
break
off
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
I
will
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
,
"
say
Mr.
B.
,
"
very
early
to
take
notice
of
this
lovely
girl
,
even
when
she
be
hardly
thirteen
year
old
;
for
her
charm
increase
every
day
,
not
only
in
my
eye
,
but
in
the
eye
of
all
who
beheld
her
.
<EOS>
My
mother
,
as
you
(
Lady
Davers
)
know
,
take
the
great
delight
in
her
,
always
call
her
,
<EOS>
her
Pamela
,
her
good
child
:
and
her
waiting
-
maid
and
her
cabinet
of
rarity
be
her
boast
,
and
equally
shew
to
every
visitor
:
for
besides
the
beauty
of
her
figure
,
and
the
genteel
air
of
her
person
,
the
dear
girl
have
a
surprising
memory
,
<EOS>
a
solidity
of
judgment
above
her
year
,
and
a
docility
so
unequalled
,
that
she
take
all
part
of
learn
which
her
lady
,
as
fond
of
instruct
her
as
she
of
improve
by
instruction
,
crowd
upon
her
;
insomuch
that
she
have
master
to
teach
her
to
dance
,
sing
,
and
play
on
the
spinnet
,
whom
she
every
day
surprise
by
the
readiness
wherewith
she
take
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
once
,
my
mother
praise
her
girl
before
me
,
and
my
aunt
B.
(
who
be
since
dead
)
,
I
could
not
but
notice
her
fondness
for
her
,
and
say
,
"
what
do
you
design
,
Madam
,
to
do
with
or
for
,
this
Pamela
of
yours
?
<EOS>
the
accomplishment
you
give
her
will
do
her
more
hurt
than
good
;
for
they
will
set
her
so
much
above
her
degree
,
that
what
you
intend
as
a
kindness
,
may
prove
her
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
join
with
me
,
and
speak
in
a
still
strong
manner
against
give
her
such
an
education
:
and
add
,
as
I
well
remember
,
"
surely
,
sister
,
you
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
one
would
think
,
if
one
know
not
my
nephew
's
discreet
pride
,
that
you
design
her
for
something
more
than
your
own
waiting
-
maid

"
  
<EOS>
"
"
ah
!
sister
,
"
say
the
old
lady
,
"
there
be
no
fear
of
what
you
hint
at
;
his
family
pride
,
and
stately
temper
,
will
secure
my
son
:
he
have
too
much
of
his
father
in
him
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
Pamela
,
you
know
not
the
girl

<EOS>
She
have
always
in
her
thought
,
and
in
her
mouth
,
too
,
her
parent
"
mean
condition
,
and
I
shall
do
nothing
for
them

at

at
present
,
though
they
be
honest
folk

deserve
well
,
because
I
will
keep
the
girl
humble

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
but
what
can
I
do
with
the
little
baggage
?
"
continue
my
mother
;
"
she
conquer
every
thing
so
fast
,
and
have
such
a
thirst
after
knowledge
,
and
the
more
she
know
,
I
verily
think
,
the
humbler
she
be
,
that
I
can
not
help
let
go
,
as
my
son
,
when
a
little
boy
,
use
to
do
to
his
kite
,
as
fast
as
she
pull
;
and
to
what
height
she
will
soar
,
I
can
not
tell
.
  
"
<EOS>
"
I
intend
,
"
proceed
the
good
lady
,
"
at
first
,
only
to
make
her
mistress
of
some
fine
needle
-
work
,
to
qualify
her
(
as
she
have
a
delicacy
in
her
person
,
that
make
it
a
pity
ever
to
put
her
to
hard
work
)
for
a
genteel
place
;
but
she
master
that
so
fast
,
that
now
as
my
daughter
be
married
and
go
from
me
,
I
be
desirous
to
qualify
her
to
divert
and
entertain
me
in
my
thoughtful
hour
:
and
be
you
,
sister
,
to
know
what
she
be
capable
of
,
and
how
divert
her
innocent
prattle
be
to
me
,
and
her
natural
simplicity
,
which
I
encourage
her
to
preserve
amidst
all
she
learn
,
you
would
not
,
nor
my
son
neither
,
wonder
at
the
pleasure
I
take
in
her
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
her
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
do
not
want
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
have
the
girl
call
in
:
if
you
,
Madam
,
be
divert
with
her
,
that
be
enough
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
Pamela
be
a
well
companion
for
a
lady
,
than
a
monkey
or
a
harlequin
:
<EOS>
but
I
fear
you
will
set
her
above
herself
,
and
make
her
vain
and
pert
;
and
that
,
at
last
,
in
order
to
support
her
pride
,
she
may
fall
into
temptation
which
may
be
fatal
to
herself
,
and
other
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
this
from
my
son

reply
the
good
lady
.
"
<EOS>
but
the
moment
I
see
my
favour
puff
her
up
<EOS>
,
I
shall
take
other
measure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
well
,
"
think
I
to
myself
,
"
I
only
want
to
conceal
my
view
from
your
penetrating
eye
,
my
good
mother
;
and
I
shall
one
day
take
as
much
delight
in
your
girl
,
and
her
accomplishment
,
as
you
now
do
;
so
go
on
,
and
improve
her
as
fast
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
now
and
then
talk
against
her
,
to
blind
you
;
and
doubt
not
that
all
you
do
will
qualify
her
the
well
for
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
only
,
"
think
I
,
"
fly
swiftly
on
,
two
or
three
more
tardy
year
,
and
I
will
nip
this
bud
by
the
time
it
begin
to
open
,
and
place
it
in
my
bosom
for
a
year
or
two
at

:
for
so
long
,
<EOS>
if
the
girl
behave
worthy
of
her
education

I
doubt
not
,
she
will
be
new
to
me

<EOS>
excuse
me
,
lady
;
 
excuse
me
,
Lord
Davers
;
 
if
I
be
not
ingenuous
,
I
have
better
be
silent
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
will
not
interrupt
this
affect
narration
,
by
mention
my
own
alternate
blush
,
confusion
,
and
exclamation
,
as
the
naughty
man
go
on
;
nor
the
censure
,
and
many
out
upon

of
the
attentive

brother

Lord
Davers

with
apology

the
praise
on
myself

so
frequently
intermingle
 
content
myself
to
give
you
,
as
near
as
I
can
recollect
,
the
very
sentence
of
the
dear
relator

as
to
our
occasional
exclaiming

observation

you
may
suppose
what
they
be

<EOS>
"
so
,
"
continue
Mr.
B.
,
"
I
go
on
drop
hint
against
her
now
and
then
;
and
whenever
I
meet
her
in
the
passage
about
the
house
,
or
in
the
garden
,
avoid
to
look
at
,
or
to
speak
to
her
,
as
she
pass
me
,
curtseying
,
and
put
on
a
thousand
bewitching
air
of
obligingness
and
reverence
;
while
I
(
who
think
the
good
way
to
demolish
the
influence
of
such
an
education
,
would
be
not
to
alarm
her
fear
on
one
hand
,
or
to
familiarize
myself
to
her
on
the
other
,
till
I
come
to
strike
the
blow

<EOS>
look
haughty
and
reserve
,

pass
by
her
with
a
stiff
nod
at
most
.

,
if
I
speak
,
"
how
do
your
lady
this
morning
,
girl
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
rest
well
last
night

then
,
cover
with
blush
,
and
curtseying
at
every
word
,
as
if
she
think
herself
unworthy
of
answer
my
question
,
she
would
trip
away
in
a
kind
of
confusion
,
as
soon
as
she
have
speak
.
<EOS>
and
once
I
hear
her
say
to
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"

I

all

"
these
late
hour
,
these
all
night
work
,
and
to
come
home
<EOS>
so
sober
can
not
be
right.-I'm
not
sure
,
if
I
be
to
know
all
,
(
and
yet
I
be
afraid
of
inquire
after
your
way
)
whether
I
should
not
have
reason
to
wish
you
be
bring
home
in
wine
,
rather
than
to
come
in
so
sober
,
and
so
late
,
as
you
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
once
,
I
remember
,
in
the
summer
-
time
,
I
come
home
about
six
in
the
morning
,
and
meet
the
good
lady
unexpectedly
by
the
garden
back
-
door
,
of
which
I
have
a
key
to
let
myself
in
at
all
hour
.
<EOS>
I
start
,
and
would
have
avoid
her
:
but
she
call
me
to
her
,
and
then
I
approach
her
with
an
air
,
"
what
bring
you
,
Madam
,
into
the
garden
at
so
early
an
hour
?
"
<EOS>
turn
my
face
from
her
;
for
I
have
a
few
scratch
on
my
forehead
 
with
a
thorn
,
or
so
 
which
I
fear
she
would
be
more
inquisitive
about
than
I
care
she
should
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
and
what
make
you
,
"
say
she
,
"
so
early
here
,
Billy
?
 
<EOS>
what
a
rakish
figure
dost
thou
make
!
 
<EOS>
one
time
or
other
these
course
will
yield
you
but
little
comfort
,
on
reflection
:
would
to
God
thou
wast
but
happily
married
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
Madam
,
the
old
wish
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
bad
as
you
think
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
not
merit
so
great
a
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
these
hint
I
give
,
not
as
matter
of
glory
,
but
shame
:
<EOS>
yet
I
ought
to
tell
you
all
the
truth
,
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
meantime
,
"
think
I
,
(
for
I
use
to
have
some
compunction
for
my
vile
practice
,
when
cool
reflection
,
bring
on
by
satiety
,
have
take
hold
of
me
)
<EOS>
"
I
wish
this
sweet
girl
be
grow
to
year
of
susceptibility
,
that
I
may
reform
this
wicked
course
of
life
,
and
not
prowl
about
,
disturb
honest
folk
"
peace
,
and
endanger
myself
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
I
have
,
by
a
certain
very
daring
and
wicked
attempt
,
in
which
,
however
,
I
do
not
succeed
,
set
a
hornet
's
nest
about
my
ear
,
which
I
begin
to
apprehend
would
ste
me
to
death
,
have
once
escape
an
ambush
by
dint
of
mere
good
luck
;
I
think
it
better
to
remove
the
seat
of
my
warfare
into
another
kingdom
,
and
to
be
a
little
more
discreet
for
the
future
in
my
amours
.
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
France
a
second
time
,
and
pass
a
year
there
in
the
good
of
company
,
and
with
some
improvement
both
to
my
moral
and
understanding
;
and
have
a
very
few
sally
,
consider
my
love
of
intrigue
,
and
the
ample
mean
I
have
to
prosecute
successfully
all
the
desire
of
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
return
,
several
match
be
propose
to
me
,
and
my
good
mother
often
request
me
to
make
her
so
happy
,
as
she
call
it
,
as
to
see
me
married
before
she
die
;
but
I
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
the
state
:
for
I
never
see
a
lady
whose
temper
and
education
I
like
,
or
with
whom
I
think
I
could
live
tolerably
.
<EOS>
She
use
in
vain
therefore
to
plead
family
reason
to
me
:
 
like
most
young
fellow
,
I
be
too
much
a
self
-
lover
,
to
pay
so
great
a
regard
to
posterity
;
and
,
to
say
truth
,
have
little
solicitude
at
that
time
,
whether
my
name
be
continue
or
not
,
in
my
own
descendant
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
look
upon
my
mother
's
Pamela
with
no
small
pleasure
,
and
I
find
her
so
much
improved
,
as
well
in
person
as
behaviour
,
<EOS>
that
I
have
the
less
inducement
either
to
renew
my
intriguing
life
,
or
to
think
of
a
married
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
yet
,
as
my
mother
have
all
her
eye
about
her
,
as
the
phrase
be
,
I
affect
great
shyness
,
both
before
her
,
and
to
the
girl
;
for
I
doubt
not
,
my
very
look
would
be
watch
by
them
both
;
and
what
the
one
discover
would
not
be
a
secret
to
the
other
;
and
lay
myself
open
too
early
to
a
suspicion
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
would
but
ice
the
girl
over
,
and
make
her
lady
more
watchful
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
use
to
go
into
my
mother
's
apartment
,
and
come
out
of
it
,
without
take
the
least
notice
of
her
,
but
put
on
stiff
air
;
and
as
she
always
withdraw
when
I
come
in
,
I
never
make
any
pretence
to
keep
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
once
,
indeed
,
my
mother
,
on
my
looking
after
her
,
when
her
back
be
turn
,
say
,
"
My
dear
son
,
I
do
not
like
your
eye
follow
my
girl
so
intently
.
 
<EOS>
only
I
know
that
sparkle
lustre
natural
to
it
,
or
I
should
have
some
fear
for
my
Pamela
,
as
she
grow
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
look
after
her
.
<EOS>
Madam!-My
eye
sparkle
at
such
a
girl
as
that
!
<EOS>
no
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
may
be
your
favourite
as
a
waiting
-
maid
;
but
I
see
nothing
but
clumsy
curtsey
and
awkward
air
about
her
.
<EOS>
a
little
rustic
affectation
of
innocence
,
that
to
such
as
can
not
see
into
her
,
may
pass
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Nay
,
my
dear
,
"
reply
my
mother
,
"
do
not
say
that
,
of
all
thing
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
affectation
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
yes
,
she
have
,
in
my
eye
,
Madam
,
and
I
will
tell
you
how
it
be
;
you
have
teach
her
to
assume
the
air
of
a
gentlewoman
,
to
dance
,
and
to
enter
a
room
with
a
grace
;
and
yet
bid
her
keep
her
low
birth
and
family
in
view
:
and
between
the
one
character
,
which
she
want
to
get
into
,
and
the
other
she
dare
not
get
out
of
,
she
trip
up
and
down
mincingly
,
and
know
not
how
to
set
her
foot
:
<EOS>
so
'
tis
the
same
in
every
gesture
:
her
arm
<EOS>
she
know
not
whether
to
swim
with
,
or
to
hold
before
her
,
nor
whether
to
hold
her
head
up
or
down
;
and
so
do
neither
,
but
hang
it
on
one
side
:
<EOS>
a
little
awkward
piece
of
one
-
and
-
t'other
<EOS>
I
think
her
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
you
would
do
the
girl
more
kindness
to
put
her
into
your
dairy
,
than
to
keep
her
about
your
person
;
for
she
will
be
utterly
spoil
,
I
doubt
,
for
any
useful
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
ah
,
son
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
"
I
fear
,
by
your
description
,
you
have
mind
her
too
much
in
one
sense
,
though
not
enough
in
another
.
'
<EOS>
tis
not
my
intention
to
recommend
her
to
your
notice
,
of
all
man
;
and
I
doubt
not
,
if
it
please
God
I
live
,
and
she
continue
a
good
girl
,
but
she
will
make
a
man
of
some
middling
,
genteel
business
,
very
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pamela
come
in
just
then
,
with
an
air
so
natural
,
so
humble
,
and
yet
so
much
above
herself
,
that
I
be
force
to
turn
my
head
from
her
,
lest
my
mother
should
watch
my
eye
again
,
and
I
be
inclined
to
do
her
that
justice
,
which
my
heart
assent
to
,
but
which
my
lip
have
just
before
deny
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
my
difficulty
,
in
apprehension
,
be
my
good
mother
;
the
effect
of
whose
lesson
to
her
girl
,
I
be
not
so
much
afraid
of
as
her
vigilance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
,
"
think
I
,
"
I
see
by
the
delicacy
of
her
person
,
the
brilliancy
of
her
eye
,
and
the
sweet
apprehensiveness
that
play
about
every
feature
of
her
face
,
she
must
have
tinder
enough
in
her
constitution
,
to
catch
a
well
-
strike
spark
;
and
I
will
warrant
I
shall
know
how
to
set
her
in
a
blaze
,
in
a
few
month
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
I
want
,
as
I
pass
,
to
catch
her
attention
too
:
<EOS>
I
expect
her
to
turn
after
me
,
and
look
so
as
to
shew
a
liking
towards
me
;
for
I
have
a
great
opinion
of
my
person
and
air
,
which
have
be
fortunately
distinguish
by
the
lady
,
whom
,
of
course
,
my
vanity
make
me
allow
to
be
very
good
judge
of
these
outward
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
to
my
great
disappointment
,
Pamela
never
,
by
any
favourable
glance
,
give
the
least
encouragement
to
my
vanity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
think
I
,
"
this
girl
have
certainly
nothing
ethereal
in
her
mould
:
all
unanimated
clay
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
dancing
and
singing
air
my
mother
be
teach
her
,
will
better
qualify
her
in
time
,
and
another
year
will
ripen
her
into
my
arm
,
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
let
me
only
go
on
thus
,
and
make
her
fear
me
:
that
will
enhance
in
her
mind
every
favour
I
shall
afterwards
vouchsafe
to
shew
her
:
and
never
question
old
humdrum
virtue
,
"
think
I
,
"
but
the
tempter
without
,
and
the
tempter
within
,
will
be
too
many
for
the
perverse
nicety
that
ever
the
sex
boast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
,
though
I
could
not
once
attract
her
eye
towards
me
,
she
never
fail
to
draw
mine
after
her
,
whenever
she
go
by
me
,
or
wherever
I
see
her
,
except
,
as
I
say
,
in
my
mother
's
presence
;
and
particularly
when
she
have
pass
me
,
and
could
not
see
me
look
at
her
,
without
turn
her
head
,
as
I
expect
so
often
from
her
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
,
Lord
Davers
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
be
once
in
love
,
or
you
would
never
have
marry
such
an
hostile
spirit

my
sister

there-

on

sauce
 
box

she

"
I

not

you

<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
how
I
could
behave
so
coolly
as
to
escape
all
discovery
so
long
from
a
lady
so
watchful
as
my
mother
,
and
from
the
apprehensiveness
of
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
to
say
nothing
of
her
tender
year
,
and
that
my
love
be
not
of
this
bashful
sort
,
I
be
not
absolutely
determine
,
so
great
be
my
pride
,
that
I
ought
to
think
her
worthy
of
be
my
mistress
,
when
I
have
not
much
reason
,
as
I
think
,
to
despair
of
prevail
upon
person
of
high
birth
(
be
I
disposed
to
try
)
to
live
with
me
upon
my
own
term

<EOS>
My
pride
,
therefore

keep
my
passion
at
bay

as
I
may
say
:
so
far
be
I
from
imagine
I
should
ever

bring
to
what
have
since
happen

<EOS>
but
to
proceed
:
  
"
Hitherto
my
mind
be
take
up
with
the
beauty
of
her
person
only

<EOS>
My
EYE
have
draw
my
heart
after
it

without
give
myself
any
trouble
about
that
sense
and
judgment
which
my

be
always
praise
in
her
Pamela

as
exceed
her
year
and
opportunity

but
an
occasion
happen
,
which
,
though
slight
in
itself

take
the
HEAD
into
the
party

a
distinction

matrimony

commonplace
book

call
it

by
her

direction

from
time

transcribe
from

other

such
passage

great
service

with
that
freedom

which
shine
in
your
saucy
letter

to
which
my

I
observe
the

write
a
pretty
hand

very
swift

free
;

affix
her
point

stop
with
so
much
judgment

her

I
begin
to
have
an
high

some
observation
likewise
upon
several
of

so
just

solid

tacitly
surprised
at
them

My

watch
my
eye

be
silent

I
seem
not

observe
that

do

after
a
while

lay
down
the

shut
it
with
great
indifference

talk

another
subject

I

I

when
I

pretty

good

my

I
be
sure
I
take
great
pain

you

alas

I
to
very
little
purpose

You

always
a
violent
headstrong
will

"
some
allowance
for
boy
and
girl

I
hope
,
Madam

but
you
see
I
be
as
good
for
a
man
as
my
sister
for
a
woman

no

you

I
be
sorry

<EOS>
Madam

you
give
me
a
sad
opinion
of
myself

<EOS>
"
Brazen
wretch
!

my
lady

but
go
on

<EOS>

turn
to
one
of
the
girl
's
observation
on
some
text
,
"
say
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
;
and
be
pleased
with
it
more
than
I
would
own

<EOS>
the
girl
be
well
enough
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
for
what
she
be
;
but
let
's
see
what
she
will
be
a
few
year
hence
.
<EOS>
then
will
be
the
trial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
She
will
be
always
good
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
can
not
we
talk
of
any
other
subject
?
<EOS>
You
complain
how
seldom
I
attend
you
;
and
when
you
be
always
talk
of
matrimony
,
or
of
this
low
-
bear
,
raw
girl
,
it
must
needs
lessen
the
pleasure
of
approach
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
now
,
as
I
hint
to
you
,
lady
,
and
my
lord
,
I
have
a
still
high
opinion
of
Pamela
;
and
esteem
her
more
worthy
of
my
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
,
"
think
I
,
"
the
girl
have
good
sense
,
and
it
will
be
some
pleasure
to
watch
by
what
gradation
she
may
be
make
to
rise
into
love
,
and
into
a
high
life
,
than
that
to
which
she
be
bear
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
I
begin
to
think
she
would
be
worthy
in
time
of
be
my
mistress
,
which
,
till
now
,
as
I
say
before
,
I
have
be
a
little
scrupulous
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
a
little
tour
soon
after
this
in
company
of
some
friend
,
with
whom
I
have
contract
an
intimacy
abroad
,
into
Scotland
and
Ireland
,
they
have
a
curiosity
to
see
those
country
,
and
we
spend
six
or
eight
month
on
this
expedition
;
and
when
I
have
land
them
in
France
,
I
return
home
,
and
find
my
good
mother
in
a
very
indifferent
state
of
health
,
but
her
Pamela
arrive
to
a
height
of
beauty
and
perfection
which
exceed
all
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
take
with
her
charm
<EOS>
when
I
first
see
her
,
which
be
in
the
garden
,
with
a
book
in
her
hand
,
just
come
out
of
a
little
summer
-
house
,
that
I
then
think
of
oblige
her
to
go
back
again
,
in
order
to
begin
a
parley
with
her
:
but
while
I
be
resolve
,
she
tript
away
with
her
curtesie
and
reverence
,
and
be
out
of
my
sight
before
I
could
determine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
resolve
,
however
,
not
to
be
long
without
her
;
and
Mrs.
Jewkes
have
be
recommend
to
me
a
little
before
,
by
a
brother
-
rake
,
as
a
woman
of
try
fidelity
,
I
ask
her
if
she
would
be
faithful
,
if
I
have
occasion
to
commit
a
pretty
girl
to
her
care
?
  
<EOS>
"
She
hope
,
she
say
,
it
would
be
with
the
lady
's
own
consent
,
and
she
should
make
no
scruple
in
obey
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
think
I
would
way
-
lie
the
girl
,
and
carry
her
first
to
a
little
village
in
Northamptonshire
,
to
an
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Jewkes
's
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
bring
her
to
be
easy
and
pacify
a
little
,
I
design
that
Jewkes
should
attend
her
to
Lincolnshire
:
for
I
know
there
be
no
come
at
her
here
,
under
my
mother
's
wing
,
by
her
own
consent
,
and
that
to
offer
term
to
her
,
would
be
to
blow
up
my
project
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
be
sensible
,
that
Mrs.
Jervis
would
stand
in
the
way
of
my
proceeding
as
well
as
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
method
I
have
contrive
be
quite
easy
,
as
I
imagine
,
and
such
as
could
not
have
fail
to
answer
my
purpose
,
as
to
carry
her
off
;
and
I
doubt
not
of
make
her
well
satisfied
in
her
good
fortune
very
quickly
;
for
,
have
a
notion
of
her
affectionate
duty
to
her
parent
,
I
be
not
displeased
that
I
could
make
the
term
very
easy
and
happy
to
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
most
stand
in
my
way
,
be
my
mother
's
fondness
for
her
:
but
suppose
I
have
get
her
favourite
in
my
hand
,
which
appear
to
me
,
as
I
say
,
a
task
very
easy
to
be
conquer
,
I
have
actually
form
a
letter
for
her
to
transcribe
,
acknowledge
a
love
-
affair
,
and
lay
her
withdraw
herself
so
privately
,
to
an
implicit
obedience
to
her
husband
's
command
,
to
whom
she
be
marry
that
morning
,
and
who
,
be
a
young
gentleman
of
genteel
family
,
and
dependent
on
his
friend
,
be
desirous
of
keep
it
all
a
profound
secret
;
and
beg
,
on
that
account
,
her
lady
not
to
divulge
it
,
so
much
as
to
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
to
prepare
for
this
,
and
make
her
escape
the
more
probable
,
when
matter
be
ripe
for
my
plot
,
I
come
in
one
night
,
and
examine
all
the
servant
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
,
the
latter
in
my
mother
's
hearing
,
about
a
genteel
young
man
,
whom
I
pretend
to
find
with
a
pillion
on
the
horse
he
ride
upon
,
wait
about
the
back
door
of
the
garden
,
for
somebody
to
come
to
him
;
and
who
ride
off
,
when
I
come
up
to
the
door
,
as
fast
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
nobody
know
any
thing
of
the
matter
,
and
they
be
much
surprised
at
what
I
tell
them
:
but
I
beg
Pamela
may
be
watch
,
and
that
no
one
would
say
any
thing
to
her
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
say
,
she
have
two
reason
not
to
speak
of
it
to
Pamela
:
one
to
oblige
me
:
the
other
and
chief
,
because
it
would
break
the
poor
innocent
girl
's
heart
,
to
be
suspect
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
poor
dear
child
!
"
say
she
,
"
whither
can
she
go
,
to
be
so
happy
as
with
me
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
inevitable
ruin
to
her
to
leave
me
?
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
come
after
her
:
she
receive
no
letter
,
but
now
-
and
-
then
one
from
her
father
and
mother
,
and
those
she
shew
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
reply
I
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
she
can
have
no
design
;
 
'
twould
be
strange
if
she
have
form
any
to
leave
so
good
a
mistress
;
but
you
can
not
be
sure
all
the
letter
she
receive
be
from
her
father
;
and
her
shewing
to
you
those
he
write
,
look
like
a
cloak
to
other
she
may
receive
from
another
hand
.
<EOS>
but
it
can
be
no
harm
to
have
an
eye
upon
her
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
,
Madam
,
what
trick
there
be
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
not
I
,
indeed
;
but
only
this
I
know
,
that
the
girl
shall
be
under
no
restraint
,
if
she
be
resolve
to
leave
me
,
well
as
I
love
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Jervis
say
,
she
would
have
an
eye
upon
Pamela
,
in
obedience
to
my
command
,
but
she
be
sure
there
be
no
need
;
nor
would
she
so
much
wind
the
poor
child
's
peace
,
as
to
mention
the
matter
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
I
suffer
to
blow
off
,
and
seem
to
my
mother
to
have
so
good
an
opinion
of
her
Pamela
,
that
I
be
sorry
,
as
I
tell
her
,
I
have
such
a
surmise
:
say
,
that
though
the
fellow
and
the
pillion
be
odd
circumstance
,
yet
I
dare
to
say
,
there
be
nothing
in
it
:
for
I
doubt
not
,
the
girl
's
duty
and
gratitude
would
hinder
her
from
do
a
foolish
or
rash
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
my
mother
hear
with
pleasure
:
although
my
motive
be
but
to
lay
Pamela
on
the
thick
to
her
,
when
she
be
to
be
tell
she
have
escape
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
glad
I
be
not
an
enemy
to
the
poor
child
.
"
<EOS>
Pamela
have
no
friend
but
me
,
"
continue
she
;
"
and
if
I
do
not
provide
for
her
,
I
shall
have
do
her
more
harm
than
good
(
as
you
and
your
aunt
B.
have
often
say
,
)
in
the
accomplishment
I
have
give
her
:
and
<EOS>
yet
the
poor
girl
<EOS>
,
I
see
that
,
"
add
she
,
"
would
not
be
backward
to
turn
her
hand
to
any
thing
for
the
sake
of
an
honest
livelihood
,
be
she
put
to
it
;
which
,
if
it
please
God
to
spare
me
,
and
she
continue
good
,
she
never
shall
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
not
,
Pamela
,
at
your
tear
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Your
lady
be
an
excellent
woman
,
and
deserve
this
tribute
to
her
memory
.
<EOS>
all
my
pleasure
now
be
,
that
she
know
not
half
my
wicked
prank
,
and
that
I
do
not
vex
her
worthy
heart
in
the
prosecution
of
this
scheme
;
which
would
have
give
me
a
severe
sting
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
I
may
have
apprehend
,
with
too
much
reason
,
that
I
have
shorten
her
day
by
the
knowledge
of
the
one
and
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thus
every
thing
ready
for
the
execution
of
my
project
:
but
my
mother
's
ill
state
of
health
give
me
too
much
concern
,
to
permit
me
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
and
,
now
-
and
-
then
,
as
my
frequent
attendance
in
her
illness
give
me
an
opportunity
of
observe
more
and
more
of
the
girl
;
her
affectionate
duty
,
and
continual
tear
<EOS>
(
find
her
often
on
her
knee
,
pray
for
her
mistress
,
)
<EOS>
I
be
move
to
pity
her
;
and
while
those
scene
of
my
mother
's
illness
and
decline
be
before
me
,
I
would
resolve
to
conquer
,
if
possible
,
my
guilty
passion
,
as
those
scene
teach
me
,
while
their
impression
hold
,
justly
to
call
it
;
and
I
be
much
concerned
to
find
it
so
difficult
a
task
;
for
,
till
now
,
I
think
it
principally
owe
to
my
usual
enterprising
temper
,
and
a
love
of
intrigue
;
and
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
resolve
against
it
,
and
to
subdue
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
greatly
mistaken
:
for
I
have
insensibly
bring
myself
to
admire
her
in
every
thing
she
say
or
do
;
and
there
be
so
much
gracefulness
,
humility
,
and
innocence
in
her
whole
behaviour
,
and
I
see
so
many
melt
scene
between
her
lady
and
her
,
that
I
find
I
could
not
master
my
esteem
for
her

<EOS>
"
My
mother
's
illness
increase
beyond
hope
of
recovery
,
and
have
settle
all
her
great
affair

she
talk
to
me
of
her
servant

I
ask
what
she
would
have
do
for
Pamela

Mrs.
Jervis

Make
Mrs.
Jervis

my

as
happy

you

you

let
her
always
be
treat
as
such

but
for
your
own

do
not
make
her
independent

for
then
you
will
want
a
faithful
manager

<EOS>
yet
if
you

should
not
value
her
as
she
deserve

allow
her

love
her

to
you

your

She
be
just
arrive
at
a
try
time
of
life

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
for
her

<EOS>
what
I
have
design
be
,
that
if
any
man
of
a
genteel
calling
should
offer
,
I
would
give
her
a
little
pretty
portion

have
God
spare
my
life

then

be
she
make
independent
,
some
idle
fellow
may
snap
her
up
;
for
she
be
very
pretty

or
if
she
should
carry
what
you
give
her
to
her
poor
parent

as
her
duty
would
lead
her
to
do
,
they
be
so
unhappily
involve

that
a
little
matter
would
be
nothing
to
them
,
and
the
poor
girl
may
be
to
seek
again
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Lady
Davers
will
take
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
wish
she
be
not
so
pretty
!
<EOS>
She
may
be
the
bird
for
which
some
wicked
fowler
will
spread
his
snare

it
may

every
lady

such
a

You

"
the
dear
girl

the
small

pox
in
a
mortifying
manner
:
she
would
be
lovely
though
in
the
genteelness
of
her
person
and
the
excellency
of
her
mind
;
and
more
out
of
danger
of

from
the
transcient
beauty
of
countenance

I
think
,
"
add
she

"
she
may
be
safe
and
happy
under
Mrs.
Jervis

care

if
you
marry
,
and
your
lady
part
with
Mrs.
Jervis
,
let
'em
go
together
,
and
live
as
they
like
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
will
be
the
good
for
both

<EOS>
and
you
have
a
generous
spirit
enough
:
I
will
not
direct
you
in
the
quantum
.
<EOS>

,
my
dear
son

remember
that
I
be
the
less
concerned
,
that
I
have
not
do
for
the
poor
girl
myself
,
because
I
depend
upon
you
:
<EOS>
the
manner
how
fitly
to
provide
for
her
,
have
make
me
defer
it
till
now
,
that
I
have
so
much
more
important
concern
on
my
hand
;
life
and
strength
ebbing
so
fast
,
that
I
be
hardly
fit
for
any
thing
,
or
to
wish
for
any
thing
,
but
to
receive
the
last
releasing
stroke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
he
stop
,
be
under
some
concern
himself
,
and
we
in
much
more

<EOS>
at
last
he
resume
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
too
naturally
think
,
my
lord
 
and
you
,
my
good
lady
 
that
the
mind
must
be
truly
diabolical
,
that
could
break
through
the
regard
due
to
the
solemn
injunction
of
a
die
parent
.
<EOS>
They
do
hold
me
a
good
while
indeed
;
and
as
fast
as
I
find
any
emotion
of
a
contrary
nature
rise
in
my
breast
,
I
endeavour
for
some
time
to
suppress
them
,
and
to
think
and
act
as
I
ought
;
but
the
dear
bewitching
girl
every
day
rise
in
her
charm
upon
me
:
and
find
she
still
continue
the
use
of
her
pen
and
ink
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
entertain
a
jealousy
,
that
she
be
write
to
somebody
who
stand
well
in
her
opinion
;
and
my
love
for
her
,
and
my
own
spirit
of
intrigue
,
make
it
a
sweetheart
of
course
.
<EOS>
and
I
could
not
help
watch
her
emotion
;
and
see
her
once
put
a
letter
she
have
just
fold
up
,
into
her
bosom
,
at
my
entrance
into
my
mother
's
dressing
-
room
,
I
make
no
doubt
of
detect
her
,
and
her
correspondent
;
and
so
I
take
the
letter
from
her
stay
<EOS>
,
she
tremble
and
curtsey
with
a
sweet
confusion
:
and
highly
pleased
I
be
to
find
it
contain
only
innocence
and
duty
to
the
deceased
mistress
,
and
the
love
parent
,
express
her
joy
that
,
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
for
lose
the
one
,
she
be
not
oblige
to
return
to
be
a
burden
to
the
other
;
and
I
give
it
her
again
,
with
word
of
encouragement
,
and
go
down
much
better
satisfied
than
I
have
be
with
her
correspondence
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
when
I
reflect
upon
the
innocent
simplicity
of
her
style
,
I
be
still
more
in
love
with
her
,
and
form
a
stratagem
,
and
succeed
in
it
,
to
come
at
her
other
letter
,
which
I
send
forward
,
after
I
have
read
them
,
all
but
three
or
four
,
which
I
keep
back
,
when
my
plot
begin
to
ripen
for
execution
;
although
the
little
slut
be
most
abominably
free
with
my
character
to
her
parent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
censure
me
,
no
doubt
,
that
my
mother
's
injunction
make
not
a
more
lasting
impression
.
<EOS>
but
really
I
struggle
hard
with
myself
to
give
them
their
due
force
:
and
<EOS>
the
dear
girl
,
as
I
say
,
every
day
grow
lovely
,
and
more
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Her
letter
be
but
<EOS>
so
many
link
to
the
chain
in
which
she
have
bind
me
;
and
though
once
I
have
resolve
to
part
with
her
to
Lady
Davers
,
and
you
,
Madam
,
have
an
intention
to
take
her
,
I
could
not
for
my
life
give
her
up
;
and
think
more
honourably
then
of
the
state
of
a
mistress
than
I
have
do
since
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
(
since
I
intend
to
do
as
handsomely
by
her
as
ever
man
do
to
a
lady
in
that
situation
)
but
that
I
should
do
better
for
her
than
my
mother
have
wish
me
to
do
,
and
so
more
than
answer
all
her
injunction
,
as
to
the
providing
for
her
:
and
I
could
not
imagine
I
should
meet
with
a
resistance
I
have
seldom
encounter
from
person
much
her
superior
as
to
descent
;
and
be
amazed
at
it
;
for
it
confound
me
in
all
the
notion
I
have
of
her
sex
,
which
,
like
a
true
libertine
,
I
suppose
want
nothing
but
importunity
and
opportunity
,
a
bold
attempter
,
and
a
mind
not
ungenerous
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
admire
her
for
her
virtue
;
at
other
time
,
impetuous
in
my
temper
,
and
unused
to
control
,
I
could
have
beat
her
.
<EOS>
She
<EOS>
well
,
I
remember
,
describe
the
tumult
of
my
soul
,
repeat
what
once
pass
between
us
,
in
word
like
,
these
:
 
<EOS>
"
take
the
little
witch
from
me
,
Mrs.
Jervis
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
neither
bear
,
nor
forbear
her
 
<EOS>
but
stay
-
<EOS>
you
shall
not
go
 
<EOS>
yet
be
go
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
come
back
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
think
I
be
mad
,
she
say
in
her
paper
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
little
less
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
I
take
her
arm
,
and
gripe
it
black
and
blue
,
to
bring
her
back
again
;
and
then
sit
down
and
look
at
her
as
silly
as
such
a
poor
girl
as
she
!
 
<EOS>
well
do
she
describe
the
passion
I
struggle
with
;
and
no
one
can
conceive
how
much
my
pride
make
me
despise
myself
at
time
for
the
little
action
my
love
for
her
put
me
upon
,
and
yet
to
find
that
love
increase
every
day
,
as
her
charm
and
her
resistance
increase
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
catch
myself
in
a
rage
fit
,
sometimes
vow
I
would
have
her
,
and
,
at
other
,
jealous
that
,
to
secure
herself
from
my
attempt
,
she
would
throw
herself
into
the
arm
of
some
menial
or
inferior
,
whom
otherwise
she
would
not
have
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
sometimes
I
soothe
,
sometimes
threaten
her
;
but
never
be
such
courage
,
when
her
virtue
seem
in
danger
,
mix
with
so
much
humility
,
when
her
fear
give
way
to
her
hope
of
a
juster
treatment
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
would
think
it
impossible
<EOS>
(
so
slight
an
opinion
have
I
of
woman
's
virtue
)
<EOS>
that
such
a
girl
as
this
,
cottage
-
bear
,
who
owe
every
thing
to
my
family
,
and
have
an
absolute
dependence
upon
my
pleasure
:
myself
not
despicable
in
person
or
mind
,
as
I
suppose
;
she
unprejudice
in
any
man
's
favour
,
at
an
age
susceptible
of
impression
,
and
a
frame
and
constitution
not
ice
or
snow
:
"
<EOS>
surely
,
"
think
I
,
"
all
this
frost
must
be
owe
to
the
want
of
fire
in
my
attempt
to
thaw
it
:
<EOS>
I
use
to
dare
more
,
and
succeed
better
.
<EOS>
Shall
such
a
girl
as
this
awe
me
by
her
rigid
virtue
?
<EOS>
no
,
she
shall
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
would
resolve
to
be
more
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
yet
my
love
be
a
traitor

be
more
faithful
to
her
than
to
me

have
more
honour
in
it
at
bottom

I

by
her
unaffected
innocence

a
virtue
I
have
never
before
encounter
,
so
uniform
and
immovable

the
moment
I
see
her
<EOS>
I
be
half
disarm

I
court
her
consent
to
that
,
which
,
though
I
be
not
likely
to
obtain
,

it
go
against

it

I
would
listen
meanly
at

to
overhear

little
conversation

suborn
Mrs.

inconsistently
talk
of
honour

no

step
I
take

action

any
thing

lose
my
dignity
among
my
servant

make
a
party
in
her
favour
against
me
,
of
every
body
,
but
whom
my
money
corrupt
,
and
that
hardly
sufficient
to
keep
my
partisan
steady
to
my
interest

greatly
do
the
virtue

the
servant
triumph
over
the
vice
of
the
master

confirm
by
such
an
example

all
the
world
,
I
shall
be
obnoxious
,
if
I
take
such
a
step
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
this
tend
to
demonstrate
the
strength
of
my
passion
:
I
could
not
conquer
my
love
;
so
I
conquer
a
pride
,
which
every
one
think
unconquerable
;
and
since
I
could
not
make
an
innocent
heart
vicious
,
I
have
the
happiness
to
follow
so
good
an
example
;
and
by
this
means
,
a
vicious
heart
be
become
virtuous
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
pleasure
of
rejoice
in
the
change
,
and
hope
I
shall
do
so
still
more
and
more
;
for
I
really
view
with
contempt
my
past
folly
;
and
it
be
now
a
great
wonder
to
me
how
I
could
act
as
I
do
,
than
that
I
should
detest
those
action
,
which
make
me
a
curse
,
instead
of
a
benefit
to
society
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
yet
so
pious
as
my
Pamela
;
but
that
be
to
come
;
and
it
be
one
good
sign
,
that
I
can
truly
say
,
I
delight
in
every
instance
of
her
piety
and
virtue
:
and
now
I
will
conclude
my
tedious
narration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
thus
he
end
his
affect
relation
:
which
in
the
course
of
it
give
me
a
thousand
different
emotion
;
and
make
me
often
pray
for
him
,
that
God
will
entirely
convert
a
heart
so
generous
and
worthy
,
as
his
be
on
most
occasion
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
can
but
find
him
not
deviate
,
when
we
go
to
London
,
I
shall
greatly
hope
that
nothing
will
affect
his
moral
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
read
over
again
the
foregoing
account
of
himself
.
<EOS>
as
near
as
I
remember
(
and
my
memory
be
the
good
faculty
I
have
)
,
it
be
pretty
exact
;
only
he
be
full
of
beautiful
similitude
,
and
speak
in
a
more
flowery
style
,
as
I
may
say
.
<EOS>
yet
do
not
you
think
,
Miss
<EOS>
(
if
I
have
not
do
injustice
to
his
spirit
)
,
that
the
beginning
of
it
,
especially
,
be
in
the
saucy
air
of
a
man
too
much
alive
to
such
notion
?
<EOS>
for
so
the
lady
observe
in
his
narration
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
very
like
the
style
of
a
true
penitent
?
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
he
go
on
better
,
and
conclude
good
of
all
.
  
<EOS>
but
do
not
you
observe
what
a
dear
good
lady
I
have
?
<EOS>
a
thousand
blessing
on
her
beloved
memory
!
<EOS>
be
I
to
live
to
see
my
child
's
child
,
they
should
be
all
teach
to
lisp
her
praise
before
they
could
speak
.
<EOS>
My
gratitude
should
always
be
renew
in
their
mouth
;
and
God
,
and
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
my
lady
,
and
my
master
that
be
,
my
good
friend
that
be
,
but
principally
,
as
most
due
,
the
FIRST
,
who
inspire
all
the
rest
,
should
have
their
morning
,
their
noontide
,
and
their
evening
praise
,
as
long
as
I
live
!
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
observe
farther
,
as
to
this
my
third
conversation
-
piece
,
that
my
Lord
Davers
offer
to
extenuate
some
part
of
his
dear
brother
-
in
-
law
's
conduct
,
which
he
do
not
himself
vindicate
;
and
Mr.
B.
be
pleased
to
say
,
that
my
lord
be
always
very
candid
to
him
,
and
kind
in
his
allowance
for
the
sally
of
ungovernable
youth
.
<EOS>
upon
which
my
lady
say
,
a
little
tartly
,
"
yes
,
and
for
a
very
good
reason
,
I
doubt
not
;
for
who
care
to
condemn
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
my
lord
pleasantly
,
"
do
not
put
us
upon
a
foot
,
neither
:
for
what
sally
I
make
before
I
know
your
ladyship
,
be
<EOS>
but
like
those
of
a
fox
,
which
now
and
then
run
away
with
a
straggle
pullet
,
when
nobody
see
him
,
whereas
those
of
my
brother
be
like
the
invasion
of
a
lion
,
break
into
every
man
's
fold
,
and
drive
the
shepherd
,
as
well
as
the
sheep
,
before
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
my
lady
,
"
but
I
can
look
round
me
,
and
have
reason
,
perhaps
,
to
think
the
invade
lion
have
come
off
,
little
as
he
deserve
it
,
well
than
the
creep
fox
,
who
,
with
all
his
cunning
,
sometimes
suffer
for
his
pilfer
theft
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
o
,
my
dear
,
these
gentleman
be
strange
creature
!
 
<EOS>
what
can
they
think
of
themselves
?
<EOS>
for
they
say
,
there
be
not
one
virtuous
man
in
five
;
but
I
hope
,
for
our
sex
's
sake
,
as
well
as
for
the
world
's
sake
,
all
be
not
true
that
evil
fame
report
;
for
you
know
<EOS>
every
man
-
trespasser
must
find
or
make
a
woman
-
trespasser
!
 
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
what
a
world
be
this
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
must
the
innocent
suffer
from
the
guilty
!
<EOS>
yet
,
how
much
well
be
it
to
suffer
one
's
self
,
than
to
be
the
cause
of
another
's
suffering
?
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
of
you
,
and
must
shorten
my
future
account
,
or
I
shall
do
nothing
but
write
,
and
tire
you
into
the
bargain
,
though
I
can
not
my

I
will
gladly

<EOS>
Your

and
their

and
yours

;
your

on
the

title

Baronet

;
the
just
applause
confer
upon
you
by
all
,
<EOS>
particularly
the
good
countess
;
your
breakfast
conversation
,
and
the
narrative
of
your
saucy
abominable
master
,
though
amiable
husband
;
all
delight
us
beyond
expression
.
  
<EOS>
do
go
on
,
dear
excellent
lady
,
with
your
charming
journal
,
and
let
us
know
all
that
pass
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
state
of
matter
with
us
,
I
have
desire
my
papa
to
allow
me
to
decline
Mr.
Murray
's
address
.
<EOS>
the
good
man
love
me
most
violently
,
nay
,
he
could
not
live
without
me
:
life
be
no
life
,
unless
I
favour
him
:
but
<EOS>
yet
,
after
a
few
more
of
these
flight
,
he
be
try
to
sit
down
satisfied
without
my
papa
's
foolish
perverse
girl
,
as
Sir
Simon
call
me
,
and
to
transpose
his
affection
to
a
worthy
object
,
my
sister
Nancy
;
and
it
would
make
you
smile
to
see
how
,
a
little
while
before
he
directly
apply
to
her
<EOS>
,
she
screw
up
her
mouth
to
my
mamma
,
and
,
truly
,
she
would
have
none
of
Polly
's
leaving
;
no
,
not
she
!
 
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
do
he
declare
himself
in
form
,
than
the
gaudy
wretch
,
as
he
be
before
with
her
,
become
a
well
-
dress
gentleman
;
 
<EOS>
the
chatter
magpie
<EOS>
(
for
he
talk
and
laugh
much
)
,
quite
conversable
,
and
have
something
agreeable
to
say
upon
every
subject
.
<EOS>
once
he
would
make
a
good
master
of
the
buck
-
hound
;
but
now
,
really
,
the
more
one
be
in
his
company
,
the
more
polite
one
find
him
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
on
his
part
,
 
he
happen
to
see
Miss
Polly
first
;
and
truly
,
he
could
have
think
himself
very
happy
in
so
agreeable
a
young
lady
;
yet
there
be
always
something
of
majesty
(
what
a
stately
name
for
ill
nature
!
)
<EOS>
in
Miss
Nancy
,
something
so
awful
;
that
while
Miss
Polly
engage
the
affection
at
first
sight
,
Miss
Nancy
strike
a
man
with
reverence
;
insomuch
,
that
the
one
may
he
love
as
a
woman
,
but
the
other
revere
as
something
more
:
a
goddess
,
no
doubt
!
  
<EOS>
I
do
but
think
,
that
when
he
come
to
be
lift
up
to
her
celestial
sphere
,
as
her
fellow
constellation
,
what
a
figure
Nancy
and
her
ursus
major
will
make
together
;
and
how
will
they
glitter
and
shine
to
the
wonder
of
all
beholder
!
  
<EOS>
then
she
must
make
a
bright
appearance
by
far
,
and
a
more
pleasing
one
too
:
for
why
?
<EOS>
She
have
three
thousand
satellite
,
or
little
star
,
in
her
train
more
than
poor
<EOS>
Polly
can
pretend
to
.
<EOS>
will
not
there
be
a
fine
twinkling
and
sparkling
,
think
you
,
when
the
great
and
less
bear
-
star
be
join
together
?
  
<EOS>
but
excuse
me
,
dear
Mrs.
B.
;
this
saucy
girl
have
vex
me
just
now
,
by
her
ill
-
natured
trick
;
and
I
be
even
with
her
,
have
thus
vent
my
spite
,
though
she
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
fancy
you
see
Polly
Darnford
abandon
by
her
own
fault
;
her
papa
angry
at
her
;
her
mamma
pity
her
,
and
call
her
silly
girl
;
Mr.
Murray
,
who
be
a
rough
lover
,
growl
over
his
mistress
,
as
a
dog
over
a
bone
he
fear
to
lose
;
Miss
Nancy
,
put
on
her
prudish
pleasantry
,
snarl
out
a
kind
word
,
and
break
through
her
sullen
gloom
,
for
a
smile
now
and
then
in
return
;
and
I
laugh
at
both
in
my
sleeve
,
and
think
I
shall
soon
get
leave
to
attend
you
in
town
,
which
will
be
well
than
twenty
humble
servant
of
Mr.
Murray
's
cast

<EOS>
or
,
if
I
can
not

that
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of

correspondence
here
,
and
enjoy

unrivalled

this
ill

temper
girl
be
always
envy
me

<EOS>
forgive
all
this
nonsense
.
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
write
something
,
though
bad
than
nothing
,
to
shew
how
desirous
I
be
to
oblige
you
,
have
I
a

as
you

<EOS>
but
nobody
can
love
you
better

or
admire
you
more
,
of
this
you
may
be
assure
(
however
unequal
in
all
other

,
than

<EOS>
I
send
you
up
some
of
your

for
the
good
couple
in
Kent

<EOS>
pray
,
pay
my

My

generous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Lord

be

of
the

with
them
home
;
and
Lord

They

,
but
without
that
censurable
fondness
which
sit
so
ill
upon
some
married
folk
in
company
.
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
dean
,
our
good
minister
,
whom
I
name
last
,
because
I
would
close
with
one
of
the
worthy
;
and
his
daughter
,
who
come
to
supply
her
mamma
's
place
,
who
be
indispose
;
a
well
-
behave
prudent
young
lady
.
<EOS>
and
here
be
our
fourteen
guest
.
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
of
C.
,
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
Mr.
H.
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
and
your
humble
servant
,
make
up
the
rest
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
thus
we
have
a
capacious
and
brilliant
circle
;
and
all
the
avenue
to
the
house
be
crowd
with
their
equipage
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
of
discourse
at
dinner
be
various
,
as
you
may
well
suppose
;
and
the
circle
be
too
large
to
fall
upon
any
regular
or
very
remarkable
topic
.
<EOS>
a
good
deal
of
sprightly
wit
,
however
,
fly
about
,
between
the
Earl
of
D.
,
Lady
Towers
,
and
Mr.
Martin
,
in
which
that
lord
suffer
as
he
deserve
;
for
he
be
no
match
for
the
lady
,
especially
as
the
presence
of
the
dean
be
a
very
visible
restraint
upon
him
,
and
Mr.
Brooks
too
:
<EOS>
so
much
awe
will
the
character
of
a
good
clergyman
always
have
upon
even
forward
spirit
,
where
he
be
know
to
have
have
an
inviolable
regard
to
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
the
good
gentleman
have
,
naturally
,
a
genteel
and
inoffensive
vein
of
raillery
,
and
so
be
too
hard
for
them
at
their
own
weapon
.
<EOS>
but
after
dinner
,
and
the
servant
be
withdraw
,
Mr.
Martin
single
me
out
,
as
he
love
to
do
,
for
a
subject
of
encomium
,
and
make
some
high
compliment
to
my
dear
Mr.
B.
upon
his
choice
;
and
wish
(
as
he
often
do
)
,
he
could
find
just
such
another
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
tell
him
it
be
a
thing
as
unaccountable
as
it
be
unreasonable
,
that
every
rake
who
love
to
destroy
virtue
,
should
expect
to
be
reward
with
it
:
and
if
his
brother
B.
have
come
off
so
well
,
she
think
no
one
else
ought
to
expect
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
say
,
it
be
a
very
just
observation
:
and
she
think
it
a
pity
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
law
,
that
every
man
who
make
a
harlot
of
an
honest
woman
,
should
be
oblige
to
marry
one
of
another
be
make
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
say
,
that
would
be
too
severe
;
it
would
be
punishment
enough
,
if
he
be
to
marry
his
own
;
and
especially
if
he
have
not
seduce
her
under
promise
of
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
would
have
a
man
be
oblige
to
stand
to
his
promise
,
I
suppose
,
Mr.
B.
?
"
reply
Lady
Davers
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
she
,
"
the
proof
would
be
difficult
perhaps
:
and
the
most
unguilty
heart
of
our
sex
may
be
least
able
to
make
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
say
you
,
my
Lord
D.
;
will
you
,
and
my
Lord
Davers
,
join
to
bring
a
bill
into
the
House
of
Peers
,
for
the
purpose
I
mention
?
<EOS>
I
fancy
my
brother
would
give
it
all
the
assistance
he
could
in
the
Lower
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
say
Mr.
B.
,
"
if
I
may
be
allow
to
speak
in
the
plural
number
,
we
must
not
pretend
to
hold
an
argument
on
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
what
say
you

Mr.
H.

<EOS>
which
side
be
you
of

"
 
<EOS>
"
every

he
,
"
who

not

a
criminal

I
be
always

the
power
of

"
  
<EOS>
"
that

return
Lady
Towers
,
"
that
Mr.

of
deserve

<EOS>
"
 
"
'
Tis
well

Mr.

that

deter
a

Lady
Davers

"
Jackey

one
of
his

my

Lord

:

you
ought
not

introduce
two
different
conversation
into
different
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
"
say
Lady
Arthur
,
"
since
you
seem
to
have
be
so
hard
put
to
it
,
as

man

what
be
to

do
with
the
married

who
ruin
an
innocent
body
?
 
<EOS>
what
punishment
,
Lady
Towers
,
shall
we
find
out
for
such
an
one
;
and
what
reparation
to
the
injure
?
<EOS>
"
this
be
say
with
a
particular
view
to
the
earl
,
on
a
late
scandalous
occasion
;
as
I
afterwards
find
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
the
punishment
of
the
gentleman
,
"
reply
Lady
Towers
,
"
where
the
law
be
not
provide
for
it
,
it
must
be
leave
,
I
believe
,
to
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
It
will
then
one
day
be
heavy
enough
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
reparation
to
the
woman
,
so
far
as
it
can
be
make
,
it
will
be
determinable
as
the
unhappy
person
may
or
may
not
know
,
that
her
seducer
be
a
married
man
:
if
she
know
he
be
,
I
think
she
neither
deserve
redress
nor
pity
,
though
it
elevate
not
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
case
be
otherwise
,
and
she
have
no
means
of
inform
herself
that
he
be
married
,
and
he
promise
to
make
her
his
wife

to
be
sure
,
though
she
can
not

acquit
,
he
deserve
the
severe
punishment
that
can

inflict

<EOS>
what
say
you
,
Mrs.
B.
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
must
speak
,
I
think
that
since
custom
now
exact
so
little
regard
to
virtue
from
man
,
and
so
much
from
woman
,
and
since
the
design
of
the
former
upon
the
latter
be
so
flagrantly
avow
and
know
,
the
poor
creature
,
who
suffer
herself
to
be
seduce
,
either
by
a
single
or
married
man
,
with
promise
,
or
without
,
have
only
to
sequester
herself
from
the
world
,
and
devote
the
rest
of
her
day
to
penitence
and
obscurity
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
gentleman
,
"
add
I
,
"
he
must
,
I
doubt
,
be
leave
to
his
conscience
,
as
you
say
,
Lady
Towers
,
which
he
will
one
day
have
enough
to
do
to
pacify
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
every
young
lady
have
not
your
angelic
perfection
,
Madam

"
say
Mr.
Dormer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
case
in
which
the
fair
sex
deserve
compassion
,
our
execration
.
<EOS>
love
may
insensibly
steal
upon

soft
heart
;
when

lull'd
asleep

a

<EOS>

the
more

Mrs.

generally
the
most
credulous

<EOS>

very
true

my

seldom

tempt
some

very
satirically

We
be
upon

subject

virtue

let
us
talk
of
something
in

this

us
then

retort
Mr.

to
be
even
with
one
lady
at

find
a
subject
that
will
be
new

her

that
be
CHARITY
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
what
I

concern
Mr.

more
than
any

be
disposed

take
offence
at
it

<EOS>
"
You
must
pardon
me
,
Lady
Towers

Mr.
B.

<EOS>
I
think
a
lady
should
never
make
a
motion
to
wave
such
subject
as
those
of
virtue

honour
;

less
still

I

she
.

if
,
Sir

you
think
it
may
do
good
,
we
will
continue
it

the

of
all
you

(
look
round
her
archly

who
be
of
opinion

<EOS>
a
health
to

royal
family

bring
on
public
affair
and
politic
;
and
the
lady
withdraw
to
coffee
and
tea
<EOS>
,
I
have
no

<EOS>
SATURDAY
morning
  
<EOS>
the
countess
be
a
little
indisposed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
and
I
take
an
airing
this
morning
in
the
chariot
,
and
have
a
long
discourse
together
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
be
pleased
to
express
great
favour
and
tenderness
towards
me
;
give
me
much
good
advice
,
as
to
the
care
she
would
have
me
take
of
myself
;
and
tell
me
,
that
her
hope
,
as
well
as
her
brother
's
,
all
centre
in
my
welfare
;
and
that
the
way
I
be
in
make
her
love
me
better
and
better
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
pleased
to
tell
me
,
how
much
she
approve
of
the
domestic
management
;
and
to
say
,
that
she
never
see
such
regularity
and
method
in
any
family
in
her
life
,
where
be
the
like
number
of
servant
:
every
one
,
she
say
,
know
their
duty
,
and
do
it
without
speak
to
,
in
such
silence
,
and
with
so
much
apparent
cheerfulness
and
delight
,
without
the
least
hurry
or
confusion
,
that
it
be
her
surprise
and
admiration
:
but
kindly
would
have
it
that
I
take
too
much
care
upon
me
.
"
<EOS>
yet
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
do
not
see
<EOS>
but
you
be
always
fresh
and
lively
,
and
never
seem
tired
or
fatigue
;
and
be
always
dressed
and
easy
,
so
that
no
company
find
you
unprepared
,
or
unfit
to
receive
them
,
come
when
they
will
,
whether
it
be
to
breakfast
or
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
ladyship
,
I
owe
all
this
and
most
of
the
conduct
for
which
she
be
pleased
to
praise
me
,
to
her
dear
brother
,
who
,
at
the
beginning
of
my
happiness
,
give
me
several
caution
and
instruction
for
my
behaviour
;
which
have
be
the
rule
of
my
conduct
ever
since
,
and
I
hope
ever
would
be
:
 
"
to
say
nothing
,
"
add
I
,
"
which
yet
would
be
very
unjust
,
of
the
assistance
I
receive
from
worthy
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
be
an
excellent
manager
.
"
  
<EOS>
Good
Creature
,
Sweet
Pamela
,
and
Charming
Girl
,
be
her
common
word
;
and
she
be
pleased
to
attribute
to
me
a
graceful
and
unaffected
ease
,
and
that
I
have
a
natural
dignity
in
my
person
and
behaviour
,
which
at
once
command
love
and
reverence
;
so
that
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
I
be
in
danger
of
be
proud
.
<EOS>
for
you
must
believe
,
that
her
ladyship
's
approbation
give
me
great
pleasure
;
and
the
more
,
as
I
be
afraid
,
before
she
come
,
I
should
not
have
come
on
near
so
well
in
her
opinion
.
<EOS>
as
the
chariot
pass
along
,
she
take
great
notice
of
the
respect
pay
me
by
people
of
different
rank
,
and
of
the
blessing
bestow
upon
me
,
by
several
,
as
we
proceed
;
and
say
,
she
should
fare
well
,
and
be
rich
in
good
wish
,
for
be
in
my
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
good
people
who
know
us
,
will
do
so
,
Madam
,
"
say
I
;
"
but
I
have
rather
have
their
silent
prayer
than
their
audible
one
;
and
I
have
cause
some
of
them
to
be
tell
so
.
<EOS>
what
I
apprehend
be
,
that
you
will
be
more
uneasy
to
-
morrow
,
when
at
church
you
will
see
a
good
many
people
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
indeed
my
story
,
and
your
dear
brother
's
tenderness
to
me
,
be
so
much
talk
of
,
that
many
stranger
be
bring
hither
to
see
us
:
'
<EOS>
tis
the
only
thing
,
"
continue
I
<EOS>
(
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
,
Miss
)
<EOS>
,
"
that
make
me
desirous
to
go
to
London
;
for
by
the
time
we
return
,
the
novelty
,
I
hope
,
will
cease
.
"
<EOS>
then
I
mention
some
verse
of
Mr.
Cowley
,
which
be
lay
under
my
cushion
in
our
seat
at
church
,
two
sunday
ago
,
by
some
unknown
hand
;
and
how
uneasy
they
have
make
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
transcribe
them
,
my
dear
,
and
give
you
the
particular
of
our
conversation
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
verse
be
these
:
    
"
Thou
robb'st
my
day
of
bus'ness
and
delight
,

<EOS>
I
have
them
in
my
pocket
,
and
read
them
to
my
lady
;
who
ask
me
,
if
her
brother
have
see
them
?
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
it
be
he
that
find
them
under
the
cushion
I
use
to
sit
upon
;
but
do
not
shew
them
to
me
till
I
come
home
;
and
that
I
be
so
vexed
at
them
,
that
I
could
not
go
to
church
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
should
you
be
vex
at
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
:
"
how
could
you
help
it
?
<EOS>
My
brother
be
not
disturb
at
them
,
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
reply
I
:
"
he
chide
me
for
be
so
;
and
be
pleased
to
make
me
a
fine
compliment
upon
it
;
that
he
do
not
wonder
that
every
body
who
see
me
love
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
this
be
all
that
wicked
wit
be
good
for
,
to
inspire
such
boldness
in
bad
heart
,
which
may
otherwise
not
dare
to
set
pen
to
paper
to
affront
any
one
.
<EOS>
but
pray
,
Madam
,
"
add
I
,
"
do
not
own
I
have
tell
you
of
them
,
lest
the
least
shadow
of
a
thought
should
arise
,
that
I
be
prompt
by
some
vile
secret
vanity
,
to
tell
your
ladyship
of
them
,
when
I
be
sure
,
they
have
vex
me
more
than
enough
.
<EOS>
for
be
it
not
a
sad
thing
,
that
the
church
should
be
profane
by
such
action
,
and
such
thought
,
as
ought
not
to
be
bring
into
it
?
<EOS>
then
,
Madam
,
to
have
any
wicked
man
dare
to
think
of
one
with
impure
notion
!
<EOS>
It
give
me
the
less
opinion
of
myself
,
that
I
should
be
so
much
as
thought
of
as
the
object
of
any
wicked
body
's
wish
.
<EOS>
I
have
call
myself
to
account
upon
it
,
whether
any
levity
in
my
look
,
my
dress
,
my
appearance
,
could
embolden
such
an
offensive
insolence
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
think
upon
this
occasion
well
of
Julius
Caesar
's
delicacy
than
I
do
,
when
I
read
of
it
;
who
,
upon
an
attempt
make
on
his
wife
,
to
which
,
however
,
it
do
not
appear
she
give
the
least
encouragement
,
say
to
those
who
plead
for
her
against
the
divorce
he
be
resolve
upon
,
that
the
wife
of
Caesar
ought
not
to
be
suspect
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Madam
,
"
continue
I
,
"
it
would
extremely
shock
me
,
but
to
know
that
any
wicked
heart
have
conceive
a
design
upon
me
;
upon
me
,
give
me
leave
to
repeat
,
<EOS>
whose
only
glory
and
merit
be
,
that
I
have
have
the
grace
to
withstand
the
great
of
trial
and
temptation
,
from
a
gentleman
more
worthy
to
be
beloved
,
both
for
person
and
mind
,
than
any
man
in
England

<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
observation

my
dear

be
truly
delicate
,
and
such
as
become
your
mind
and
character

<EOS>
and
I
really
think
,
if
any
lady
in
the
world
be
secure
from
vile
attempt
,
it
must
be
you
;
not
only
from
your
story
,
so
well
known
,
and
the
love
you
bear
to
your
man
,
and
his
merit
to
you
,
but
from
the
prudence
,
and
natural
dignity
,
I
will
say
,
of
your
behaviour
,
which
,
though
easy
and
cheerful
,
be
what
would
strike
dead
the
hope
of
any
presumptuous
libertine
the
moment
he
see
you

<EOS>

how
can
I
enough

return
I
,
and
kiss
her
hand

acknowledge
your

polite
goodness
in
this
compliment

<EOS>
but
,
my
lady

you
see
by
the
very
instance
I
have
mention
,
that
a
liberty
be
take
,
which
I
can
not

of
without
pain

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
pleased
with
your
delicacy

my

as
I
say
before
.
<EOS>
You
can
never
err
,
whilst
thus
watchful
over
your
conduct
:
and
I
own
you
have
the
more
reason
for
it
,
as
you
have
marry
<EOS>
a
mere
Julius
Caesar
,
an
open
-
eyed
rake
"
(
that
be
her
word
)
,
"
who
would
,
on
the
least
surmise
,
though
ever
so
causeless
on
your
part

have
all
his
passion
up
in
arm

in
fear

liberty

offer
like

not

to
take

<EOS>
"
o
but
,
Madam
,
"
say
I
,
"
he
have
give
me
great
satisfaction
in
one
point
;
for
you
must
think
I
should
not
love
him
as
I
ought
,
if
I
have
not
a
concern
for
his
future
happiness
,
as
well
as
for
his
present
;
and
that
is
,
he
have
assure
me
,
that
in
all
the
liberty
he
have
take
,
he
never
attempt
a
married
lady
,
but
always
abhor
the
thought
of
so
great
an
evil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
tis
pity

"
say
her
ladyship
,
"
that
a
man
who
could
conquer
his
passion
so
far
,
could
not
subdue
them
entirely
.
<EOS>
this
shews
it
be
in
his
own
power
to
do
so
;
and
increase
his
crime
:
and
what
a
wretch
be
he
,
who
scruple
,
under
pretence
of
conscience
or
honour
,
to
attempt
lady
within
the
pale
,
boggle
not
to
ruin
a
poor
creature
without
;
although
he
know
,
he
thereby
,
most
probably
,
for
ever
deprive
her
of
that
protection
,
by
prevent
her
marriage
,
which
even
among
such
rake
as
himself
,
be
deem
,
he
own
,
inviolable
;
and
so
cast
the
poor
creature
headlong
into
the
jaw
of
perdition
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
"
reply
I
,
"
this
be
the
very
inference
I
make
upon
the
occasion

<EOS>
"
and
what
could
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
say
,
my
inference
be
just
;
but
call
me
pretty
preacher
;
 
and
once
have
caution
me
not
to
be
over
-
serious
to
him
,
so
as
to
cast
a
gloom
,
as
he
say
,
over
our
innocent
enjoyment
,
I
never

to
urge
matter
farther
,

how
your

charm
me

<EOS>
I
charge
you
,
when
you
get
to
town
,
let
me
have
your
remark
on
the
diversion
you
will
be
carry
to
by
my
brother
.
<EOS>
now
I
know
what
to
expect
from
you
,
and
you
know
how
acceptable
every
thing
from
you
will
be
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
promise
great
pleasure
,
as
well
to
myself
as
to
my
worthy
friend

particularly
to
Lady
Betty

in
your
unrestrained
free
correspondence

<EOS>
indeed
,
Pamela

I
must
bring
you
acquaint
with
Lady
Betty
<EOS>
:
she
be
one
of
the
worthy
of
our
sex
,
and
have
a
fine
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
(
for
the
world
say
it
not
to
my
brother
,
nor
let
Lady
Betty
know
I
tell
you
so
,
if
ever
you
should
be
acquaint
)
<EOS>
I
have
carry
the
matter
so
far
by
my
officious
zeal
to
have
my
brother
married
to
so
fine
a
lady
,
not
doubt
his
joyful
approbation
,
that
it
be
no
small
disappointment
to
her
,
when
he
marry
you
:
and
this
be
the
good
excuse
I
can
make
for
my
furious
behaviour
to
you
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
for
though
I
be
naturally
very
hasty
and
passionate
,
yet
then
I
be
almost
mad
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
my
disappointment
have
give
me
so
much
indignation
both
against
you
and
him
,
that
it
be
well
I
do
not
do
some
violent
thing
by
you
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
do
feel
the
weight
of
my
hand
:
but
what
be
that
?
'
<EOS>
Twas
<EOS>
well
I
do
not
kill
you
dead

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
these
be
her

for
how

the
wild
libertine
capable
of
be
engage
by
such
noble
motive

thee
what
thou
art

for

Your

I

all

high

I
tell
thee
,
Pamela

that
the
old
story
of
Eleanor
and
Rosamond
run
in
my
head
all
the
way
of
my
journey
,
and
I
almost
wish
for
a
potion
to
force
down
thy
throat
:
when
I
find
thy
lewd
paramour
absent
,
(
for
little
do
I
think
thou
wast
marry
to
him

though
I
expect
thou
wouldst
try
to
persuade
me
to
believe
it

fear
that
his
intrigue
with
thee
would
effectually
frustrate
my
hope
as
to
Lady
Betty
and
him
:
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
think
I

"
all
happen
as
I

<EOS>
now
will
I
confront
this
brazen
girl
!
 
<EOS>
now
will
I
try
her
innocence
,
as
I
please
,
by
offer
to
take
her
away
with
me
;
if
she
refuse
,
take
that
refusal
for
a
demonstration
of
her
guilt
;
and
then
,
"
think
I
,

I
will
make
the
creature
provoke
me
,
in
the
presence
of
my
nephew

my
woman

(
<EOS>

I
hope
to
have
get
that
woman
jewke
to
testify
for
me
too

,

<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
what
I
may
have
do
,
if
thou
hadst
not
escape
out
of
the
window
,
especially
after
tell
me
thou
wast
as
much
married
as
I
be
,
and
hadst
shew
me
his
tender
letter
to
thee
,
which
have
a
quite
different
effect
upon
me
than
you
expect
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
have
commit
any
act
of
violence
,
what
remorse
should
I
have
have
on
reflection
,
and
know
what
an
excellence
I
have
injure
!
<EOS>
thank
God
thou
didst
escape
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
her
ladyship
fold
her
arm
about
me
,
and
kiss
me
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
sad
story
,
you
will
say
,
my
dear
:
and
I
wonder
what
her
ladyship
's
passion
would
have
make
her
do
!
<EOS>
surely
she
would
not
have
kill
me
dead
!
<EOS>
surely
she
would
not
!
 
<EOS>
let
it
not
,
however

Miss
Darnford

you

you
see
it
 
go
out

Lady
Davers

sake
,
to
any
body
else
 
<EOS>
no

not

<EOS>
It
make
me
tremble
a
little

distance

to
think
what
a
sad
thing
passion
be

when

its
ungovernable
tumult

how
it
deform

debase
the
noble

<EOS>
We
return
from
this
agreeable
airing
just
in
time
to
dress
before
dinner

then
my

I
go
together
into
the
countess

apartment

where
I
receive
abundance
of
compliment
from
both

<EOS>
as
this
brief
conversation
will
give
you
some
notion
of
that
management

economy
for
which
they
heap
upon
me
their
kind
praise
,
I
will
recite
to
you
what
pass
in
it

and
hope
you
will
not
think
me
too
vain
;
and
the
less
,
because
what
I
undergo
formerly
from
my
lady

indignation

half
entitle
me
to
be
proud
of
her
present
kindness

favour

,
"
say
she
,
"
may
have
give
great
pleasure
to
Lady
Davers
<EOS>
,
for
it
can
not
be
otherwise
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
great
notion
of
her
ladyship
's
condescension
,
as
you
call
it
<EOS>
(
pardon
me
,
Madam
,
"
say
she
to
her
,
smile
)
"
<EOS>
when
she
can
not
raise
her
style
above
the
word
girl
,
come
off
from
a
tour
you
have
make
so
delightful
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
protest
to
you
,
my
Lady
C.
,
"
reply
her
ladyship
,
with
great
goodness
,
"
that
word
,
which
once
I
use
through
pride
,
as
you
will
call
it
,
I
now
use
for
a
very
different
reason
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
doubt
,
whether
to
call
her
sister
,
be
not
more
honour
to
myself
than
to
her
;
and
to
this
hour
be
not
quite
<EOS>
convinc'd
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
,
I
will
call
her
so
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
overcome
with
this
fine
compliment
,
but
could
not
answer
a
word
:
and
the
countess
say
,
"
I
could
have
spare
you
longer
,
have
not
the
time
of
day
compel
your
return
;
for
I
have
be
very
agreeably
entertain
,
as
well
as
you
,
although
but
with
the
talk
of
your
woman
and
mine
.
<EOS>
for
here
they
have
be
give
me
such
an
account
of
Mrs.
B.
's
economy
,
and
family
management
,
as
have
highly
delighted
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
the
like
;
and
in
so
young
a
lady
too
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
strange
reformation
to
make
in
our
family
,
Lady
Davers
,
when
we
go
home
,
be
we
to
follow
so
good
an
example
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
"
continue
her
ladyship
,
"
you
out
-
do
all
your
neighbour
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
be
glad
I
live
so
far
from
you
:
 
for
<EOS>
be
I
to
try
to
imitate
you
<EOS>
,
it
would
still
be
but
imitation
,
and
you
would
have
the
honour
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yet
you
hear
,
and
you
see
by
yesterday
's
conversation
,
"
say
Lady
Davers
,
"
how
much
her
good
neighbour
,
of
both
sex
,
<EOS>
admire
her
:
they
all
yield
to
her
the
palm
,
unenvying
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
my
good
lady
,
"
say
I
,
<EOS>
"
it
be
a
sign
<EOS>
I
have
most
excellent
neighbour
,
full
of
generosity
,
and
willing
to
encourage
a
young
person
in
do
right
thing
:
so
it
make
,
consider
what
I
be
,
more
for
their
honour
than
my
own
.
<EOS>
for
what
censure
should
not
such
a
one
as
I
deserve
,
who
have
not
be
educate
to
fill
up
my
time
like
lady
of
condition
,
be
I
not
to
employ
myself
as
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
so
little
other
merit
,
and
who
bring
no
fortune
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
Pamela
,
none
of
your
self
-
deny
ordinance
,
"
that
be
Lady
Davers
's
word
;
"
you
must
know
something
of
your
own
excellence
:
if
you
do
not
,
I
will
tell
it
you
,
because
there
be
no
fear
you
will
be
proud
or
vain
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
,
then
,
that
there
be
the
lady
in
yours
,
or
any
neighbourhood
<EOS>
,
that
behave
with
more
decorum
,
or
well
keep
up
the
part
of
a
lady
,
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
how
you
manage
it
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
you
do
as
much
by
a
look
,
and
a
pleasant
one
too
,
that
be
the
rarity
!
<EOS>
as
I
do
by
high
word
,
and
passionate
exclamation
:
I
have
often
nothing
but
blunder
upon
blunder
,
as
if
the
wretch
be
in
a
confederacy
to
try
my
patience
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
awe
they
have
of
your
ladyship
,
because
of
your
high
quality
,
make
them
commit
blunder
;
for
I
myself
be
always
more
afraid
of
appear
before
your
ladyship
,
when
you
have
visit
your
honour
mother
,
than
of
any
body
else
,
and
have
be
the
more
sensibly
awkward
through
that
very
awful
respect
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Psha
,
psha
,
Pamela
,
that
be
not
it
:
'
tis
all
in
yourself

<EOS>
I
use
to
think
my
mamma
,
and
my
brother
too
,
have
as
awkward
servant
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
any
<EOS>
where
 
except
Mrs.

well
enough
for
a
bachelor
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>

,
here
!
 
<EOS>
thou

Hast
thou

"
no

Madam

how
!

the

<EOS>
all
of

pardon
me
,
Mrs.

your

as
one
may
say
,
and
all
of
them
so
respectful
,
so
watchful
of
your
eye

you

at

so
gentle
to
them

so
easy

so
cheerful

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
me
,
my
dear
,
insufferably
vain
?
<EOS>
but
'
tis
what
they
be
pleased
to
say
.
'
<EOS>
twas
their
goodness
to
me
,
and
shew
how
much
they
can
excel
in
generous
politeness

<EOS>
so
I
will
proceed
.
<EOS>
"
why
this
,

continue
the
countess

"
must
be
bear
dignity
 
bear
discretion
 
Education
can
not
give
it
:
 
if
it
could
,
why
should
not
we
have
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
say
many
more
kind
thing
of
me
then
;
and
after
dinner
they
mention
all
over
again
,
with
addition
,
before
my
good
friend
,
who
be
kindly
delighted
with
the
encomium
give
me
by
two
lady
of
such
distinguishing
judgment
in
all
other
case
.
<EOS>
They
tell
him
,
how
much
they
admire
my
family
management
:
then
they
would
have
it
that
my
genius
be
universal
,
for
the
employment
and
accomplishment
of
my
sex
,
whether
they
consider
it
as
employ
in
penmanship
,
in
needlework
,
in
pay
or
receive
visit
,
in
music
,
and
I
can
not
tell
how
many
other
qualification
,
which
they
be
pleased
to
attribute
to
me
,
over
and
above
the
family
management
:
say
,
that
I
have
an
understanding
which
comprehend
every
thing
,
and
an
eye
that
penetrate
into
the
very
bottom
of
matter
in
a
moment
,
and
never
be
at
a
loss
for
the
should
be
,
<EOS>
the
why
or
wherefore
,
and
the
how
 
these
be
their
comprehensive
word
;
that
I
do
every
thing
with
celerity
,
clear
all
as
I
go
,
and
leave
nothing
,
they
observe
,
to
come
over
again
,
that
could
be
dispatch
at
once
:
by
which
mean
,
they
say
,
every
hand
be
clear
to
undertake
a
new
work
,
as
well
as
my
own
head
to
direct
it
;
and
there
be
no
hurry
nor
confusion
:
but
every
coming
hour
be
fresh
and
ready
,
and
unincumbered
(
so
they
say
)
,
for
its
new
employment
;
and
to
this
they
attribute
that
ease
and
pleasure
with
which
every
thing
be
perform
,
and
that
I
could
do
and
cause
to
be
do
,
so
much
business
without
hurry
either
to
myself
or
servant
.
  
<EOS>
judge
<EOS>
how
pleasing
this
be
to
my
good
beloved
,
who
find
,
in
their
kind
approbation
,
such
a
justification
of
his
own
conduct
as
could
not
fail
of
be
pleasing
to
him
,
especially
as
Lady
Davers
be
one
of
the
kind
praiser
.
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
be
so
highly
delighted
,
that
he
rise
once
,
beg
his
brother
's
excuse
,
to
salute
me
,
and
stand
over
my
chair
,
with
a
pleasure
in
his
look
that
can
not
be
express
,
now
-
and
-
then
lift
up
his
hand
,
and
his
good
-
natured
eye
glisten
with
joy
,
which
a
pier
-
glass
give
me
the
opportunity
of
seeing
,
as
sometimes
I
steal
a
bashful
glance
towards
it
,
not
know
how
or
which
way
to
look
.
<EOS>
even
Mr.
H.
seem
to
be
touch
very
sensibly
;
and
recollect
his
behaviour
to
me
at
the
Hall
,
he
once
cry
out
,
"
what
a
sad
whelp
be
I

to
behave
as
I
formerly
do

to
so
much
excellence
!
 
<EOS>
not
,
Mr.
B.
,
that
I
be
any
thing
uncivil
neither
;
 
but
in
unworthy
sneer
,
and
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
me
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
You
call
me
,
<EOS>
tinsell'd
boy

Madam

do
not
you
remember
that

and
say
,
twenty

thirty
year
hence

when
I
be

you
would
give
me
an
answer

Mr.

"
<EOS>
Pamela

not
quite
perfect

<EOS>
We
must
not
provoke
her
;
for
she
will
call
us
both
so
,
perhaps
;
for
I
wear
a
laced
coat

sometimes
,
as
well
as
you

<EOS>
"
Nay

Madam

I

plaguily
wrong

I

nothing

myself

hang
myself

often

bring
in

<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
smile
,
say
,
with
severity
enough
in
his
meaning
,
as
I
see
by
the
turn
of
his
countenance
,
"
Mr.
H.
know
that
his
birth
and
family
entitle
him
more
to
the
block

he

not
make
so
free

very
good

<EOS>
Lady
Davers
shake
her
head
at
her
brother
,
and
say
to
her
nephew
,
"
Thou'rt

natured
foolish

why
the

what

"
  
"
nothing

indeed

"
say
she
;
"
when
thou

I

down

put

down

!
"
<EOS>
this
make
every
one
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
happy
thing
be
it
,
"
think
I
,
"
that
good
nature
generally
accompany
this
character
;
else
,
how
would
some
people
be
supportable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
here
I
will
break
off
.
'
<EOS>
tis
time
,
you
will
say
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
to
whom
I
write
,
as
well
as
to
yourself
,
and
they
will
be
pleased
with
all
my
silly
scribble
.
<EOS>
so
excuse
one
part
for
that
,
and
another
for
friendship
's
sake
,
and
then
I
shall
be
wholly
excusable
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
trifler
again
resume
her
pen
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
some
pain
,
Miss
,
for
to
-
morrow
,
because
of
the
rule
we
observe
of
late
in
our
family
on
Sundays
,
and
of
go
through
a
crowd
to
church
;
which
will
afford
new
scene
to
our
noble
visitor
,
either
for
censure
or
otherwise
:
but
I
will
sooner
be
censure
for
do
what
I
think
my
duty
,
than
for
the
want
of
it
;
and
so
will
omit
nothing
that
we
have
be
accustom
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
think
ridiculous
,
or
as
one
who
aim
at
work
of
supererogation
,
for
what
I
think
be
very
short
of
my
duty
.
<EOS>
some
order
,
surely
,
become
the
head
of
family
;
and
besides
,
it
would
be
discredit
one
's
own
practice
,
if
one
do
not
appear
at
one
time
what
one
do
at
another
.
<EOS>
for
that
which
be
a
reason
for
discontinue
a
practice
for
some
company
,
would
seem
to
be
a
reason
for
lay
it
aside
for
ever
,
especially
in
a
family
visit
and
visit
as
our
.
<EOS>
and
I
remember
well
a
hint
give
me
by
my
dear
friend
once
on
another
subject
,
that
it
be
in
every
one
's
power
to
prescribe
rule
to
himself
,
after
a
while
,
and
person
to
see
what
be
one
's
way
,
and
that
one
be
not
to
be
put
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
my
only
doubt
be
,
that
to
lady
,
who
have
not
be
accustom
perhaps
to
the
necessary
strictness
,
I
should
make
myself
censurable
,
as
if
I
aim
at
too
much
perfection
:
for
,
however
one
's
duty
be
one
's
duty
,
and
ought
not
to
be
dispense
with
;
yet
,
when
a
person
,
who
use
to
be
remiss
,
see
so
hard
a
task
before
them
,
and
so
many
great
point
to
get
over
,
all
to
be
no
more
than
tolerably
regular
<EOS>
,
it
be
rather
apt
to
frighten
and
discourage
,
than
to
allure
;
and
one
must
proceed
,
as
I
have
read
soldier
do
,
in
a
difficult
siege
,
inch
by
inch
,
and
be
more
studious
to
entrench
and
fortify
themselves
,
as
they
go
on
gain
upon
the
enemy
,
than
by
rush
all
at
once
upon
an
attack
of
the
place
,
be
repulse
,
and
perhaps
oblige
with
great
loss
to
abandon
a
hopeful
enterprise
.
<EOS>
and
permit
me
to
add
,
that
young
as
I
be
,
I
have
often
observe
,
that
over
-
great
strictness
all
at
once
enjoin
and
insist
upon
,
be
not
fit
for
a
begin
reformation
,
but
for
strong
Christians
only
;
and
therefore
generally
do
more
harm
than
good
.
  
<EOS>
but
shall
I
not
be
too
grave
,
<EOS>
my
dear
friend
?
 
<EOS>
excuse
me
;
for
this
be
Saturday
night
:
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
a
very
good
method
which
the
ingenious
author
of
the
Spectator
take
,
generally
to
treat
their
more
serious
subject
on
this
day
;
so
I
think
one
should
,
when
one
can
,
consider
it
as
the
preparative
eve
to
a
still
well
.
  
<EOS>
SUNDAY
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
by
what
I
have
already
write
,
it
be
become
in
a
manner
necessary
to
acquaint
you
briefly
with
the
method
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
not
only
permit
,
but
encourage
me
to
take
,
in
the
family
he
leave
to
my
care
,
as
to
the
Sunday
duty
.
  
<EOS>
the
worthy
dean
,
at
my
request
,
and
my
beloved
's
permission
,
recommend
to
me
,
as
a
sort
of
family
chaplain
,
for
Sundays
,
a
young
gentleman
of
great
sobriety
and
piety
,
and
sound
principle
,
who
have
but
lately
take
order
,
have
at
present
no
other
provision
.
<EOS>
and
this
gentleman
come
,
and
read
prayer
to
us
about
seven
in
the
morning
,
in
the
less
hall
,
as
we
call
it
,
a
retire
apartment
,
next
the
little
garden
;
for
we
have
no
chapel
with
us
here
,
as
in
your
neighbourhood
;
and
this
generally
,
with
some
suitable
exhortation
,
or
meditation
out
of
some
good
book
,
which
he
be
so
kind
as
to
let
me
choose
now
-
and
-
then
,
when
I
please
,
take
up
little
more
than
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
number
of
servant
of
both
sex
:
and
myself
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
Polly
Barlow
,
be
generally
in
a
little
closet
,
which
,
when
we
open
the
door
,
be
but
just
a
separation
from
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
(
for
that
be
our
young
clergyman
's
name
)
have
a
desk
at
which
sometimes
Mr.
Jonathan
make
up
his
run
account
to
Mr.
Longman
,
who
be
very
scrupulous
of
admit
any
body
to
the
use
of
his
office
,
because
of
the
writing
in
his
custody
,
and
the
order
he
value
himself
upon
have
every
thing
in
.
<EOS>
about
seven
in
the
evening
he
come
again
,
and
I
generally
,
let
me
have
what
company
I
will
,
find
time
to
retire
for
about
another
half
hour
;
and
my
dear
Mr.
B.
connive
at
,
and
excuse
my
absence
,
if
enquire
after
;
though
for
so
short
a
time
,
I
be
seldom
miss
.
  
<EOS>
to
the
young
gentleman
I
shall
present
,
every
quarter
,
five
guinea
,
and
Mr.
B.
press
him
to
accept
of
a
place
at
his
table
at
his
pleasure
:
but
,
as
we
have
generally
much
company
,
his
modesty
make
him
decline
it
,
especially
at
those
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
join
with
us
very
often
in
our
Sunday
office
,
and
Mr.
Colbrand
seldom
miss
:
<EOS>
and
they
tell
Mrs.
Jervis
that
they
can
not
express
the
pleasure
they
have
to
meet
me
there
;
and
the
edification
they
receive
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
beloved
dispense
as
much
as
he
can
with
the
servant
,
for
the
evening
part
,
if
he
have
company
;
or
will
be
attend
only
by
John
or
Abraham
,
perhaps
by
turn
;
and
sometimes
look
upon
his
watch
,
and
say
,
"
'
Tis
near
seven
;
"
and
if
he
say
so
,
they
take
it
for
a
hint
that
they
may
be
dispense
with
for
half
an
hour
;
and
this
countenance
which
he
give
me
,
have
contribute
not
a
little
to
make
the
matter
easy
and
delightful
to
me
,
and
to
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
part
from
them
,
on
the
breaking
up
of
our
assembly
,
they
generally
make
a
little
row
on
each
side
of
the
hall
-
door
;
and
when
I
have
make
my
compliment
,
and
pay
my
thank
to
Mr.
Adams
,
they
whisper
,
as
I
go
out
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Madam
!
"
and
bow
and
curtsey
with
such
pleasure
in
their
honest
countenance
as
greatly
delight
me
:
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
"
so
my
good
friend
 
I
be
glad
to
see
you
 
not
one
absent
!
"
<EOS>
or
but
one
(
as
it
fall
out
)
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
obliging
,
"
I
cry
:
and
thus
I
shew
them
,
that
I
take
notice
,
if
any
body
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
and
back
again
I
go
to
pay
my
duty
to
my
earthly
benefactor
:
and
he
be
pleased
to
say
sometimes
,
that
I
come
to
him
with
such
a
radiance
in
my
countenance
,
as
give
him
double
pleasure
to
behold
me
;
and
often
tell
me
,
that
but
for
appear
too
fond
before
company
,
he
could
meet
me
as
I
enter
,
with
embrace
as
pure
as
my
own
heart
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
in
time
,
I
shall
prevail
upon
the
dear
man
to
give
me
his
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
thank
God
,
I
be
enable
to
go
thus
far
already
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
leave
the
rest
to
his
providence
.
<EOS>
for
I
have
a
point
very
delicate
to
touch
upon
in
this
particular
;
and
I
must
take
care
not
to
lose
the
ground
I
have
gain
,
by
too
precipitately
push
at
too
much
at
once
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
comfort
,
that
next
to
be
uniform
himself
,
be
that
permission
and
encouragement
he
give
me
to
be
so
,
and
his
pleasure
in
see
me
so
delighted
 
and
besides
,
he
always
give
me
his
company
to
church
.
<EOS>
o
how
happy
should
I
think
myself
,
if
he
would
be
pleased
to
accompany
me
to
the
divine
office
,
which
yet
he
have
not
do
,
though
I
have
urge
him
as
much
as
I
durst
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
ask
me
on
Saturday
evening
,
if
I
would
be
concerned
to
see
a
large
congregation
in
the
less
hall
next
morning
than
usual
?
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
no
,
by
no
mean
.
"
<EOS>
She
say
,
Mrs.
Worden
,
and
Mrs.

management
and

,
have
be
tell
our
method
,
beg
to
join
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
should
be
a
little
dash
at
so
large
a
company
;
but
the
man
be
orderly
for
lord
"

,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
assure
me
that
they
be
very

in
their

,
I
consent
to

.
  
<EOS>
when
,
at
the
usual
time
,
(
with
my
Polly
)
I
go
down
,
I
find
Mr.
Adams
here
(
to
whom
I
make
my
first
compliment
)
,
and
every
one
of
our
own
people

,
Mr.
Colbrand
except

and
Mrs.

and

,
who

also
worthy

Longman
,
and

and
Mr.

and

,
"

<EOS>
Mr.
Sidney
,
I
be
glad
to
see
you

<EOS>
how
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Longman
?
"
and
look
round
with
complacency
on
the
servant
of
our
noble
visitor
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
lead
Mrs.
Worden
and
Mrs.
Lesley
to
my
little
retiring
place
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
and
my
polly
follow

and
throw

open
,
Mr.
Adams
begin
some
select
prayer
;
and
as
he
read
with
great
emphasis
and
propriety
,
as
if
his
heart
be
in
what
he
read
,
all
the
good
folk
be
exceedingly
attentive
.
 
<EOS>
after
prayer
,
Mr.
Adams
read
a
meditation
,
from
a
collection
make
for
private
use
,
which
I
shall
more
particularly
mention
by
-
and
-
by
;
and
end
with
the
usual
benediction
,
I
thank
the
worthy
gentleman
,
and
gently
chid
him
in
Mr.
B.
's
name
,
for
his
modesty
in
decline
our
table
;
and
thank
Mr.
Longman
,
Mrs.
Worden
,
and
Mrs.
Lesley
,
receive
their
kind
wish
,
and
hasten
,
blush
through
their
praise
,
to
my
chamber
,
where
,
be
alone
,
I
pursue
the
subject
for
an
hour
,
till
breakfast
be
ready
,
when
I
attend
the
lady
,
and
my
good
beloved
,
who
have
tell
them
of
the
verse
place
under
my
cushion
at
church
.
 
<EOS>
We
set
out
,
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
myself
,
and
Mr.
H.
in
our
coach
,
and
Mr.
B.
and
the
countess
in
the
chariot
;
both
lady
and
the
gentleman
splendidly
dress
;
but
I
avoid
a
glitter
as
much
as
I
could
,
that
I
may
not
seem
to
vie
with
the
two
peeress
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
say
,
"
why
be
you
not
full
-
dressed
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
hope
he
would
not
be
displeased
;
if
he
be
,
I
would
do
as
he
command
.
<EOS>
He
kindly
answer
,
"
as
you
like
good
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
You
be
charm
in
every
dress
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
chariot
first
draw
up
to
the
church
door
,
Mr.
B.
lead
the
countess
into
church
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
Davers
do
me
that
honour
;
and
Mr.
H.
hand
his
aunt
through
a
crowd
of
gazer
,
many
of
whom
,
as
usual
,
be
stranger
.
<EOS>
the
neighbour
gentleman
and
their
lady
pay
us
their
silent
respect
;
but
the
thought
of
the
wicked
verse
,
or
rather
,
as
Lady
Davers
will
have
me
say
,
wicked
action
of
the
transcriber
of
them
,
make
me
keep
behind
the
pew
;
but
my
lady
sit
down
by
me
,
and
whisperingly
talk
between
while
,
to
me
,
with
great
tenderness
and
freedom
in
her
aspect
;
which
I
could
not
but
take
kindly
,
because
I
know
she
intend
by
it
,
to
shew
every
one
she
be
pleased
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
afterwards
she
be
pleased
to
add
,
take
my
hand
,
and
Mr.
B.
and
the
countess
hear
her
(
for
she
raise
her
voice
to
a
more
audible
whisper
)
<EOS>
,
"
I
be
proud
to
be
in
thy
company
,
and
in
this
solemn
place
,
I
take
thy
hand
,
and
acknowledge
with
pride
,
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
look
down
;
and
indeed
,
at
church
,
I
can
hardly
at
any
time
look
up
;
for
who
can
bear
to
be
gaze
at
so
?
 
and
softly
say
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
my
good
lady
!
<EOS>
how
much
you
honour
me
;
the
place
,
and
these
surround
eye
,
can
only
hinder
me
from
acknowledge
as
I
ought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
good
friend
,
with
pleasure
in
his
eye
,
say
,
press
his
hand
upon
both
our
,
as
my
lady
have
mine
in
her
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
two
beloved
creature
:
both
excellent
in
your
way
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
both
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
too
,
my
dear
brother
,
"
say
my
lady
.
  
<EOS>
the
countess
whisper
,
"
You
should
spare
a
body
a
little
!
<EOS>
You
give
one
,
lady
,
and
Mr.
B.
,
too
much
pleasure
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
such
company
,
and
such
behaviour
add
still
more
charm
to
devotion
;
and
be
I
to
be
here
a
twelvemonth
,
I
would
never
miss
once
accompany
you
to
this
good
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
think
he
must
say
something
,
and
address
himself
to
his
noble
uncle
,
who
could
not
keep
his
good
-
natured
eye
off
me
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
hang'd
,
my
lord
,
if
I
know
how
to
behave
myself
!
<EOS>
why
this
outdo
the
chapel
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
I
put
on
my
new
suit
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
look
upon
himself
,
as
if
he
would
support
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
his
part
of
the
general
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
but
think
you
not
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
and
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
that
I
be
now
in
the
height
of
my
happiness
in
this
life
,
thus
favour
by
Lady
Davers
?
<EOS>
the
dean
preach
an
excellent
sermon
;
but
I
need
not
have
say
that
;
only
to
have
mention
,
that
he
preach
,
be
say
enough
.
  
<EOS>
My
lord
lead
me
out
when
divine
service
be
over
;
and
be
a
little
tender
in
his
foot
,
from
a
gouty
notice
,
walk
very
slowly
.
<EOS>
Lady
Towers
and
Mrs.
Brooks
join
us
in
the
porch
,
and
make
us
their
compliment
,
as
do
Mr.
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
favour
us
with
your
company
home
,
my
old
acquaintance
?
"
say
Mr.
B.
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
have
a
gentleman
,
my
relation
,
to
dine
with
me
;
but
if
it
will
be
agreeable
in
the
evening
,
I
will
bring
him
with
me
to
taste
of
your
Burgundy

for
we

not
any
such

<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad

reply
Mr.

Mr.
Martin
whisper
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
more
,
however

to
admire
your

I
can
tell
you
that

than
your
wine.-get
into
your
coach

say
he
,
with
his
usual
freedom
;
"
our
maiden
and
widow
lady
have
a
fine
time
of
it
,
wherever
you
come

by
my
faith
they
must
every
one
of
them
quit
this
neighbourhood
,
if
you
be
to
stay
in
it
:
but
all
their
hope
be

that
while
you
be
in
London

they
will
have
the
game
in
their
own
hand

Sister

most

many

respectful
manner

gather
near

Mr.

Madam

say
I

smile

have
but
one
fault

<EOS>
he

too
apt

myself

rather
excused

countenance
one
day

in

my
delightful
Sunday
employment

<EOS>
I
should
have
add
,
for
I
think
a
good
clergyman
can
not
be
too
much
respected
,
that
I
repeat
my
request
to
Mr.
Adams
,
to
oblige
us
with
his
company
at
supper
;
but
he
so
very
earnestly
beg
to
be
excuse
,
and
with
so
much
concern
of
countenance
,
that
I
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
insist
upon
it
;
though
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
sure
as
I
be
that
modesty
be
always
a
sign
of
merit

<EOS>
We
return
to
the
gentleman
when
supper
be
ready
,
as
cheerful
and
easy
,
Lady
Davers
observe
,
as
if
we
have
not
be
present
at
so
solemn
a
service

"
<EOS>

this

say
she
,
after
they
be
go
,
"
make
religion
so
pleasant
and
delightful
a
thing

that
I

I
shall
have
a
much
high
opinion

it
a
regular

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
once
,
I
remember
,
when
a

at
the
house
of
a
very
devout
man
,
for
a
week
,
with
his
granddaughter
,
my
school
-
fellow
;
and
there
be
such
preachment
against
vanity
,
and
for
self
-
denial
,
that
be
we
to
have
follow
the
good
man
's
precept
,
(
though
indeed
not
his
practice

for
well
do
he
love
his
belly

,
<EOS>
half
God
Almighty

creature

work
would
have
be
useless

industry
would
have
be
banish
the

<EOS>
"
then
,
"
add
her

"
have
I
hear
the
good
man
confess
himself
guilty
of
such
sin

as
,
if
true
(

by
his
hide
his
face
with
his
broad

brim
hat

it
look
a
little
bad
against
him

ought
to
have

hang
on

fifty
foot
high

these
reflection
,
as
I
say
,
fall
from
my

after
the

be
go
,
when
she
recount
to
her
brother

the
entertainment

as
she
be
pleased
to
call
it
,
I
have
give
her
.
<EOS>
on
which
she
make
high
encomium
,
as
do
the
countess
;
and
they
praise
also
the
natural
dignity
which
they
impute
to
me
,
say
,
I
have
teach
them
a
way
they
never
could
have
find
out
,
to
descend
to
the
company
of
servant
,
and
yet
to
secure
,
and
even
augment
,
the
respect
and
veneration
of
inferior
at
the

time

<EOS>

,
Pamela

"
say
my

you
be

very
right

all

MONDAY

<EOS>
I
be
to
thank
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Damford
,
for
your
kind
letter
,
approve
of
my
scribble
.
<EOS>
when
you
come
to
my
Saturday
's
and
Sunday
's
account
,
I
shall
try
your
patience
.
<EOS>
but
no
more
of
that
;
for
as
you
can
read
them
,
or
let
them
alone
,
I
be
the
less
concerned
,
especially
as
they
will
be
more
indulgently
receive
somewhere
else
,
than
they
may
merit
;
so
that
my
labour
will
not
be
wholly
lose
.
  
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
on
your
dismissing
Mr.
Murray
;
I
could
not
help
shew
your
letter
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
think
the
free
gentleman
say
upon
it
?
<EOS>
I
be
half
afraid
to
tell
you
:
but
do
,
<EOS>
now
you
be
so
happily
disengaged
,
get
leave
to
come
,
and
let
us
two
contrive
to
be
even
with
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
only
lady
in
the
world
that
I
would
join
with
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
that
your
character
of
Mr.
Murray
and
Miss
Nancy
,
which
he
call
severe
(
but
I
will
not
call
them
so
,
without
your
leave
)
,
look
a
little
like
petty
spite
,
and
as
if
you
be
sorry
the
gentleman
take
you
at
your
word
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
he
say
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
punish
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
yet
,
he
call
you
charming
lady
,
and
say
much
in
your
praise
,
and
join
with
me
,
that
Mr.
Murray
,
who
be
so
easy
to
part
with
you
,
could
not
possibly
deserve
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Pamela
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
know
the
sex
well
enough
.
<EOS>
Miss
Polly
may
not
love
Mr.
Murray
;
yet
,
to
see
her
sister
address
and
compliment
,
and
prefer
to
herself
,
by
one
whom
she
so
lately
think
she
could
choose
or
refuse
,
be
a
mortifying
thing
.
 
<EOS>
and
young
lady
can
not
bear
to
sit
by
neglect
,
while
two
lover
be
play
pug
's
trick
with
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
all
the
preparation
to
matrimony
,
the
clothe
to
be
buy
,
the
visit
to
be
pay
and
receive
,
the
compliment
of
friend
,
the
busy
novelty
of
the
thing
,
the
day
to
be
fix
,
and
all
the
little
foolish
humour
and
nonsense
attend
a
conclude
courtship
,
when
one
sister
be
to
engross
all
the
attention
and
regard
,
the
new
equipage
,
and
so
forth
;
these
be
all
subject
of
mortification

the
other

she
have
no
great
value

man

.

"
<EOS>
well

"
say
I
,
"
a
lady
of
Miss
Darnford

good
sense

good
taste
,
be
not

affect
by

parade
,
and
have
well
consider
the
matter
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
dare
say
,
rejoice
,
rather
than
repine
,
at
miss
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
leave
the
happy
pair
(
for
they
be
so
,
if
they
think
themselves
so
)
together
,
and
Sir
Simon
to
rejoice
in
his
accomplished
son
-
in

law
elect

and
give
us
your
company
to
London

<EOS>
for
who
would
stay
to
be
vex
by
that
ill
-
natured
Miss
Nancy
,
as
you
own
you
be
,
at
your
last
writing
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
proceed
,
and
the
rather
,
as
I
have
something
to
tell
you
of
a
conversation
,
the
result
of
which
have
do
me
great
honour
,
and
give
inexpressible
delight
;
of
which
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
We
pursue
Mr.
B.
's
proposal
,
return
several
visit
in
one
day
;
for
we
have
so
polite
and
agreeable
a
neighbourhood
,
that
all
seem
desirous
to
accommodate
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
We
come
not
home
till
ten
in
the
evening
,
and
then
find
a
letter
from
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
,
uncle
by
the
half
blood
to
Mr.
B.
,
acquaint
him
,
that
hear
his
niece
,
Lady
Davers
,
be
with
him
,
he
would
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
(
be
then
upon
his
journey
)
to
pay
a
visit
to
both
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
very
particularly
odd
and
humoursome
:
and
his
eld
son
be
next
heir
to
the
maternal
estate
,
if
Mr.
B.
should
have
no
child
,
be
exceedingly
dissatisfied
with
his
debase
himself
in
marry
me
;
and
would
have
be
better
pleased
have
he
not
married
at
all
,
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
there
never
be
any
cordial
love
between
Mr.
B.
's
father
and
him
,
nor
between
the
uncle
,
and
nephew
and
niece
:
for
his
positiveness
,
roughness
,
and
self
-
interestedness
too
,
have
make
him
,
though
very
rich
,
but
little
agreeable
to
the
generous
temper
of
his
nephew
and
niece
;
yet
when
they
meet
,
which
be
not
above
once
in
four
or
five
year
,
they
be
very
civil
and
obliging
to
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
wonder
what
could
bring
him
hither
now
:
for
he
live
in
Herefordshire
,
and
seldom
stir
ten
mile
from
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
say
,
he
be
sure
it
be
not
to
compliment
him
and
me
on
our
nuptial
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
rather
,
"
say
my
lady
,
"
to
satisfy
himself
if
you
be
in
a
way
to
cut
out
his
own
cub
.

"
thank
God
,
we
be
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
whenever
I
be
strongest
set
against
matrimony
,
the
only
reason
I
have
to
weigh
against
my
dislike
to
it
be
,
that
I
be
unwilling
to
leave
so
large
a
part
of
my
estate
to
that
family
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
he
to
me
,
"
do
not
be
uneasy
;
but
you
will
see
a
relation
of
mine
much
more
disagreeable
than
you
can
imagine
;
but
no
doubt
you
have
hear
his
character

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Pamela
,
"
say
Lady
Davers
,
"
we
be
a
family

value
ourselves

upon
my
word

Sir
Jacob

all
his
line
,
have
nothing
else
to
boast
of
.

I
have
be
often
ashamed

no

every

excellent
in

I

I
doubt
I
shall
stand

poorly
with

He
will
not
dare

affront
you

Mr.

he
will
say
to
you
,

to
me
,

to
my
sister
too
,
blunt
and
rough
thing
.
<EOS>

he
will
not
stay
above
a
day
or
two
,
and
we
shall
not
see
him
again
for
some
year
to
come

we
will
bear
with
him

be

hold
both

what
would
you
advise

opinion

that

not
care

do
any
thing

require
a
dispensation

which
would
be
unlawful

it

you
speak
exceedingly
well

I
be
glad

that
you
approve
of
my

of

by
one
who
have
a
right

otherwise
this
matter
be
above

I
have
so
much
good
will
to

well

what
would
you
advise

this
case

<EOS>
the
earl
propose
,
that
Mr.

present
living
be
supply
by
a
curate
;
to
whom
,
no
doubt
,
Mr.

will
be
very
genteel
;
and
,
as
we
be
seldom
or
never
there
,
his
lordship
think
we
shall
not
be
displeased
with
it
,
and
insist
upon
propose
it
to
me
;
as
he
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
say
,
"
I
think
this
may
do
very
well

brother

<EOS>
but
what
,
pray
,
Mr.
Williams
,
do
you
propose
to
allow
to
your
curate
?
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
Sir
,
but
I
think
the
clergy
do
so
hardly
by
one
another
generally
,
that
they
be
not
to
be
surprised
that
some
of
the
laity
treat
them
as
they
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
say
Mr.
B.
,
"
tell
us
freely
,
Pamela
,
what
you
would
advise
your
friend
Mr.
Williams
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
must
I
,
Sir

speak
my
mind
on
such
a
point
,
before
so
many
well
judge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sister
,
"
say
her
ladyship
(
a
name
she
be
now
pleased
to
give
me
freely
before
stranger

after
her
dear
brother

example

be
kind

always
kind

at

you
must
;
if
I
may
be
allow
to
say
must

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
"
proceed
I
,
"
I
beg
leave
to
ask
Mr.
Williams
one
question
;
that
is
,
whether
his
present
parishioner
do
not
respect
and
esteem
him
in
that
particular
manner
,
which
I
think
every
body
must
,
who
know
his
worth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
in
the
good
-
will
of
all
my
parishioner
,
and
have
great
acknowledgment
to
make
for
their
civility
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
it
will
be
the
same
wherever
you
go
;
for
bad
as
the
world
be
,
a
prudent
and
good
clergyman
will
never
fail
of
respect
.
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
if
you
think
your
ministry
among
them
be
attend
with
good
effect
;
if
they
esteem
your
person
with
a
preference
,
and
listen
to
your
doctrine
with
attention
;
methink
,
for
their
sake
,
'
tis
pity
to
leave
them
,
be
the
living
of
less
value
,
as
it
be
of
more
,
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
for
,
how
many
people
be
there
who
can
benefit
by
one
gentleman
's
preaching
,
rather
than
by
another
be
;
although
,
possibly
,
the
one
's
ability
may
be
no
way
inferior
to
the
other
's
?
<EOS>
there
be
much
in
a
delivery
,
as
it
be
call
,
in
a
manner
,
a
deportment
,
to
engage
people
's
attention
and
liking
;
and
as
you
be
already
in
possession
of
their
esteem
,
you
be
sure
to
do
much
of
the
good
you
aim
and
wish
to
do
.
<EOS>
for
where
the
flock
love
the
shepherd
,
all
the
work
be
easy
,
and
more
than
half
do
;
and
without
that
,
let
him
have
the
tongue
of
an
angel
,
and
let
him
live
the
life
of
a
saint
,
he
will
be
hear
with
indifference
,
and
,
oftentime
,
as
his
subject
may
be
,
with
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
pause
here
;
but
every
one
be
silent
 
"
<EOS>
as
to
the
earl
's
friendship
,
Sir
,
"
continue
I
,
"
you
can
best
judge
what
force
that
ought
to
have
upon
you
;
and
what
I
have
mention
would
be
the
only
difficulty
with
me
,
be
I
in
Mr.
Williams
's
case
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
it
will
be
a
high
compliment
to
his
lordship
,
and
so
he
ought
to
think
it
,
that
you
quit
a
well
live
to
oblige
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
will
be
bind
in
honour
to
make
it
up
to
you
.
<EOS>
for
I
be
far
from
think
that
a
prudent
regard
to
worldly
interest
misbecome
the
character
of
a
good
clergyman
;
and
I
wish
all

respect

I

so

if
I

not

Mr.

I
hear
it
with
great
pleasure

that
the
benefice
Mr.

worthily
enjoy
be
a
clear
two
hundred

but
,
after
all
,
do
happiness
to
a
gentleman

a
scholar

a
philosopher
,
rest
in
a
great

less
income

<EOS>
on
the
contrary

be
it
not

find
in

<EOS>
suppose
my

Mr.

have
five
thousand
pound
a
year
add
to
his
present
large
income
,
would
that
increase
his
happiness
?
<EOS>
that
it
would
add
to
his
care
,
be
no
question
;
but
could
it
give
him
one
single
comfort
which
he
have
not
already

<EOS>
and
if
the
dear
gentleman
have
two
or
three
thousand
less
,
may
he
be
less
happy
on
that
account

<EOS>
no
,
surely
;
for
it
would
render
a
great
prudence
on
my
humble
part
necessary
,

a
nearer
inspection
,

great
frugality
,
on

he
must
be
content
(
if

,
perhaps
,
lie
up
every

<EOS>
so
long

often

for

<EOS>
one
whom
an

two
hundred

will
hardly

himself

that

do
so

like
the
considerate

genteel

with

he
beckon
out

to
examine

it
up

be
answer

I
should
say

that
his
withdrawing
with
a
very

make
me
afraid

have
go
too
far

I

never

for

Mr.

tremble
with
joy
,
and
say
,
he
could
not
tell
how
to
bear
this
excess
of
goodness
in
us
both
:
and
his
countenance
and
eye
give
testimony
of
a
gratitude
too
high
for
further
expression
.
  
<EOS>
as

approbation

you

that
I

something

measure
act
in

it

not

that
our

<EOS>
Lady

<EOS>
"
I
will
forgive

<EOS>

Mr.

<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
,
my

for
be
so
tedious
on
the
foregoing
subject
,
and
its
most
agreeable
conclusion
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
important
one
,
because
several
person
,
as
conferer
or
receiver
,
have
find
their
pleasure
and
account
in
it

and
it
would
be
well
,
if
conversation
be
often
attend
with
like
happy
consequence

<EOS>
I
have
one
merit
to
plead
in
behalf
even
of
my
prolixity
;
that
in
recite
the
delightful
conference
I
have
the
pleasure
of
hold
with
our
noble
guest
and
Mr.

<EOS>
,
I
be
careful
not
to
write
twice
upon
one
topic
,
although
several
which
I
omit
,
may
be
more
worthy
of
your
notice
than
those
I
give
;
so
that
you
have
as
much
variety
from
me
,
as
the
nature
of
the
fact
and
case
will
admit
of
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
I
will
conclude
,
have
a
very
different
subject
,
as
a
proof
of
what
I
have
advance
,
to
touch
in
my
next

till
when

I
be
your

faithful

P.B.

My

Miss
Darnford

<EOS>
I
now
proceed
with
my
journal
,
which
I
bring
down
to
Tuesday
evening
;
and
of
course
I
begin
with
  
WEDNESDAY
.
  
<EOS>
towards
evening
come
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
,
on
horseback
,
attend
by
two
servant
in
livery
.
<EOS>
I
be
abroad
;
for
I
have
get
leave
for
a
whole
afternoon
,
attend
by
my
Polly
;
which
time
I
pass
in
visit
no
less
than
four
poor
sick
family
,
whose
heart
I
make
glad
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
be
too
tedious
,
be
I
to
give
you
the
particular
;
besides
,
I
have
a
brief
list
of
case
,
which
,
when
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
,
I
may
shew
you
:
for
I
oblige
myself
,
though
not
desire
,
to
keep
an
account
of
what
I
do
with
no
less
than
two
hundred
pound
a
year
,
that
Mr.
B.
allow
me
to
expend
in
act
of
charity
and
benevolence
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
tell
me
afterwards
,
that
Sir
Jacob
carry
it
mighty
stiff
and
formal
when
he
alight
.
<EOS>
He
strut
about
the
court
-
yard
in
his
boot
,
with
his
whip
in
his
hand
;
and
though
her
ladyship
go
to
the
great
door
,
in
order
to
welcome
him
,
he
turn
short
,
and
,
whistle
,
follow
the
groom
into
the
stable
,
as
if
he
have
be
at
an
inn
,
only
,
instead
of
take
off
his
hat
,
pull
its
broad
brim
over
his
eye
,
for
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
in
she
go
in
a
pet
,
as
she
say
,
say
to
the
countess
,
"
a
surly
brute
he
always
be
!
<EOS>
My
uncle
!
<EOS>
He
be
more
of
an
ostler
than
a
gentleman
;
I
be
resolve
I
will
not
stir
to
meet
him
again
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
wretch
love
respect
from
other
,
though
he
never
practise
common
civility
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
countess
say
,
she
be
glad
he
be
come
,
for
she
love
to
divert
herself
with
such
odd
character
now
-
and
-
then
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
let
me
give
you
a
short
description
of
him
as
I
find
him
,
when
I
come
in
,
that
you
may
the
better
conceive
what
sort
of
a
gentleman
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
about
sixty
-
five
year
of
age
,
a
coarse
,
strong
,
big
-
boned
man
,
with
large
irregular
feature
;
he
have
a
haughty
supercilious
look
,
a
swaggering
gait
,
and
a
person
not
at
all
bespeak
one
's
favour
in
behalf
of
his
mind
;
and
his
mind
,
as
you
shall
hear
by
and
bye
,
not
clear
up
those
prepossession
in
his
disfavour
,
with
which
his
person
and
feature
at
first
strike
one
.
<EOS>
His
voice
be
big
and
surly
;
his
eye
little
and
fiery
;
his
mouth
large
,
with
yellow
and
blackish
tooth
,
what
be
leave
of
them
be
break
off
to
a
tolerable
regular
height
,
look
as
if
they
be
grind
down
to
his
gum
,
by
constant
use
.
<EOS>
but
with
all
these
imperfection
,
he
have
an
air
that
set
him
somewhat
above
the
mere
vulgar
,
and
make
one
think
half
his
disadvantage
rather
owe
to
his
own
haughty
humour
,
than
to
nature
;
for
he
seem
to
be
a
perfect
tyrant
at
first
sight
,
a
man
use
to
prescribe
,
and
not
to
be
prescribe
to
;
and
have
the
advantage
of
a
shrewd
penetrating
look
,
but
which
seem
rather
acquire
than
natural
.
  
<EOS>
after
he
have
see
his
horse
well
serve
,
and
put
on
an
old
-
fashioned
gold
-
button
coat
,
which
by
its
freshness
shew
he
have
be
very
chary
of
it
,
a
well
wig
,
but
in
stiff
buckle
,
and
a
long
sword
,
stuck
stiffly
,
as
if
through
his
coat
lappet
,
in
he
come
,
and
with
an
imperious
air
enter
the
parlour
,
"
what
,
nobody
come
to
meet
me
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
;
and
salute
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
niece
?
"
and
look
about
haughtily
,
she
say
,
as
if
he
expect
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
My
lady
present
the
countess

,
"

Countess
of
C.

be
many

it
be

He
accordingly
remove
his

I

very
glad

it

for
though
I
be
sure
to
be
stare
at
by
him

yet
I
fear
if
he
sit
next
me

he
would
not
keep
his
hand
off

<EOS>
He
run
on
a
deal
in
my
praise
,
after
his
manner
,

so
rough
at
time
,
that
he
give
me
pain
;
and
I
be
afraid
too
,
lest
he
should
observe
my
ring
;
but
he
stare
so
much
in
my
face
,
that
it
escape
his
notice
.
<EOS>
after
supper
,
the
gentleman
sit
down
to
their
bottle
,
and
the
lady
and
I
withdraw
,
and
about
twelve
they
break
up
;
Sir
Jacob
talk
of
nothing
but
Lady
Jenny
,
and
wish
Mr.
B.
have
happily
marry
such
a
charming
creature
,
who
carry
token
of
her
high
birth
in
her
face
,
and
whose
every
feature
and
look
shew
her
to
be
nobly
descend
.
  
<EOS>
They
let
him
go
to
bed
with
his
mistake
:
but
the
countess
say
next
morning
,
she
think
she
never
see
a
great
instance
of
stupid
pride
and
churlishness
;
and
should
be
sick
of
the
advantage
of
birth
or
ancestry
,
if
this
be
the
natural
fruit
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
for
a
man
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
"
to
come
to
his
nephew
's
house
,
and
to
suffer
the
mistress
of
it
to
be
closette
up
(
as
he
think
)
,
in
order
to
humour
his
absurd
and
brutal
insolence
,
and
to
behave
as
he
have
do
,
be
such
a
ridicule
upon
the
pride
of
descent

that
I
shall
ever
think
of
it

<EOS>
o
Mrs.
B.

"
say
she
,
"
what
advantage
have
you
over

most
over

you
unworthily

"
I
expect
to
be
call
to
breakfast
every

shall
then
,
perhaps
,
see
how
this

end

when

reveal

may
not

in

on

it
will
not
go
off
so
well

if

I

take
care
how
he
sow

seed

you

do
nothing

what
I

My

for
fear
my

be

much
affected

for
the

bend
me
down

come

the
tear

move
me
much

at
dinner
(
when

have
Mr.

tell

complain
of
the

He
go
from

afterwards
to
Mrs.

make
her
answer
many
question
about
me

how
all
these
matter
have
come
about

as
he
phrase
it
;

return
,
when
we
drink
coffee

if

be
afraid

not

ask
twice

accordingly
he
repeat
his
request

I
give
him
a
tune

,
at
his
desire
,
sing
to
it

after
supper
,
we
fall
into
a
conversation
,
of
which
I
must
give
you
some
account
,
be
on
a
topic
that
Mr.
B.
have
be
blame
for
in
his
marry
me
,
and
which
have
stick
by
some
of
his
friend
,
even
after
they
have
,
in
kindness
to
me
,
acquit
him
in
every
other
respect
;
and
that
is
,
the
example
he
have
set
to
young
gentleman
of
family
and
fortune
to
marry
beneath
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
begin
by
Sir
Jacob
,
who
say
,
"
I
be
in
love
with
my
new
niece
,
that
I
be
:
<EOS>
but
still
one
thing
stick
with
me
in
this
affair
,
which
be
,
what
will
become
of
degree
or
distinction
,
<EOS>
if
this
practice
of
gentleman
marry
their
mother
'
waiting
-
maid
 
excuse
me
,
Madam
 
should
come
into
vogue
?
<EOS>
already
,
young
lady
and
young
gentleman
be
too
apt
to
be
draw
away
thus
,
and
disgrace
their
family

We
have
too
many
instance
of
this

You
will
forgive
me

both
of
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
"
say
Lady
Davers
,
"
be
the
only
thing
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
have
hit
upon
the
point
that
would
make
one
wish
this
example
have
not
be
set
by
a
gentleman
of
such
an
ancient
family
,
till
one
become
acquaint
with
this
dear
creature
;
and
then
every
body
think
it
should
not
be
otherwise
than
it
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
Pamela
,
"
say
Mr.
B.
,
"
what
can
you
say
to
this
?
<EOS>
can
not
you
defend
me
from
this
charge
?
<EOS>
this
be
a
point
that
have
be
often
object
to
me
;
try
for
one
of
your
pretty
argument
in
my
behalf

"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Sir
,

reply
I
,
look
down
,
"
it
become
not
me
to
say
any
thing
to
this

indeed
it
do
,
if
you
can
:

I
beg
you
will
help
me
to
some
excuse

if
you
have
any
at
hand

<EOS>
"
will
not
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
dispense
with
me
on
this
occasion

<EOS>
I
know
,
not
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
should
not
,
if
I
may
judge
for
myself
,
speak
one
word
to
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
my
absolute
opinion
,
that
degree
in
general
should
be
keep
up
;
although
I
must
always
deem
the
present
case
an
happy
exception
to
the
rule
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
look
as
if
he
still
expect
I
should
say
something
.
 
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
,
Sir
,
dispense
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
repeat
I.
"
<EOS>
indeed
I
should
not
speak
to
this
point
,
if
I
may
be
my
own
judge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
intend
,
my
dear

you
shall
judge
for
yourself

,
you
know
,
I
seldom
urge
you
farther
,
when
you
use
those
word

if
you
have
any
thing
upon

have
it

for
your
argument
be
always
new

unborrowed

I
would
then
,
if
I
must

ask

if
there
be

there
have
not

a
law

whenever

be
his

have
seduce
a

her
degree

what
it
would

oblige
him

marry
that
unhappy
person

<EOS>

I
think
there
be
such
a
law
in
some
country

I
can
not
tell
where

say
Sir

do
you

so

yes

many

"
say
I
,
"
that
I
would
infer
,
be
,
whether
another
law
would
not
be
a
still
more
just
and
equitable
one
,
that
the
gentleman
who
be
repulse
,
from
a
principle
of
virtue
and
honour
,
should
not
be
censure
for
marry
a
person
he
could
not
seduce
?
<EOS>
and
whether
it
be
not
more
for
both
their
honour
,
if
he
do
:
since
it
be
noble
to
reward
a
virtue
,
than
to
repair
a
shame
,
be
that
shame
to
be
repair
by
matrimony
,
which
I
take
the
liberty
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
I
beg
pardon
<EOS>
:
you
command
me
,
Sir
,
else
this
subject
should
not
have
find
a
speaker
to
it
,
in
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
admirably
say
,
"
cry
Sir
Jacob
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
yet
this
come
not
up
to
the
objection
,
"
say
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
the
set
an
example
to
waiting
-
maid
to
aspire
,
and
to
young
gentleman
to
descend
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
enter
into
the
subject
myself
;
and
the
rather
,
because
as
I
go
along
,
I
will
give
Sir
Jacob
a
faint
sketch
of
the
merit
and
character
of
my
Pamela
,
of
which
he
can
not
be
so
well
informed
as
he
have
be
of
the
disgrace
which
he
imagine
I
have
bring
upon
myself
by
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
necessary
,
that
as
well
those
person
who
be
afraid
the
example
should
be
take
,
as
those
who
be
inclined
to
follow
it
,
should
consider
all
the
material
part
of
it
;
otherwise
,
I
think
the
precedent
may
be
justly
clear
;
and
the
fear
of
the
one
be
judge
groundless
,
and
the
plea
of
the
other
but
a
pretence
,
in
order
to
cover
a
folly
into
which
they
would
have
fall
,
whether
they
have
this
example
or
not
.
<EOS>
for
instance
,
in
order
to
lay
claim
to
the
excuse
,
which
my
conduct
,
if
I
may
suppose
it
of
force
enough
to
do
either
good
or
hurt
,
will
furnish
,
it
be
necessary
,
that
the
object
of
their
wish
should
be
a
girl
of
exquisite
beauty
(
and
that
not
only
in
their
own
blinded
and
partial
judgment
,
but
in
the
opinion
of
every
one
who
see
her
,
friend
or
foe
)
,
in
order
to
justify
the
force
which
the
first
attraction
have
upon
him
:
that
she
be
descend
of
honest
and
conscientious
,
though
poor
and
obscure
parent
;
who
have
preserve
their
integrity
,
through
great
trial
and
affliction
,
have
,
by
their
example
,
as
well
as
precept
,
lay
deep
in
the
girl
's
mind
the
foundation
of
piety
and
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
necessary
that
,
to
the
charm
of
person
,
this
waiting
-
maid
,
should
have
an
humble
,
teachable
mind
,
fine
natural
part
,
a
sprightly
,
yet
inoffensive
wit
,
a
temper
so
excellent
,
and
a
judgment
so
solid
,
as
should
promise
(
by
the
love
and
esteem
these
quality
should
attract
to
herself
from
her
fellow
-
servant
,
superior
and
inferior
)
that
she
would
become
a
high
station
,
and
be
respect
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
,
after
so
good
a
foundation
lay
by
her
parent
,
she
should
have
all
the
advantage
of
female
education
confer
upon
her
;
the
example
of
an
excellent
lady
,
improve
and
building
upon
so
worthy
a
foundation
:
a
capacity
surprisingly
ready
to
take
in
all
that
be
teach
her
:
an
attention
,
assiduity
,
and
diligence
almost
peculiar
to
herself
,
at
her
time
of
life
;
so
as
,
at
fifteen
or
sixteen
year
of
age
,
to
be
able
to
vie
with
any
young
lady
of
rank
,
as
well
in
the
natural
genteelness
of
her
person
,
as
in
her
acquirement
:
and
that
in
nothing
but
her
humility
she
should
manifest
any
difference
between
herself
and
the
high
-
bear
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
necessary
,
moreover
,
that
she
should
have
a
mind
above
temptation
;
that
she
should
resist
the
offer
and
menace
of
one
upon
whom
all
her
worldly
happiness
seem
to
depend
;
the
son
of
a
lady
to
whom
she
owe
the
great
obligation
;
a
person
whom
she
do
not
hate
,
but
greatly
fear
,
and
whom
her
grateful
heart
would
have
be
glad
to
oblige
;
and
who
seek
to
prevail
over
her
virtue
,
by
all
the
inducement
that
could
be
think
of
,
to
attract
a
young
unexperienced
virgin
at
one
time
,
or
to
frighten
her
at
another
,
into
his
purpose
;
who
offer
her
very
high
term
,
her
circumstance
consider
,
as
well
for
herself
,
as
for
parent
she
love
better
than
herself
,
whose
circumstance
be
low
and
distressful
;
yet
,
to
all
these
offer
and
menace
,
that
she
should
be
able
to
answer
in
such
word
as
these
,
which
will
always
dwell
upon
my
memory
<EOS>
"
I

I
should
be
so
far
from

such
an
honour
that
I
will
pronounce
I
should
be
most
unworthy
of
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
,
I

,
such
a

can
be
find
,
thus
beautifully
attractive
in
every
one
's
eye

not
partially
so
only
in
a

gentle
man

own
;

would
infinitely
prefer

beauty

,
thus
piously

;

genteely
educate

accomplish

brilliantly

have
be
thus

thus

by
the
man
she
hate
not

pursue
(
not
intriguingly
pursue
)
,
be
thus
inflexibly
virtuous
,
and
proof
against
temptation
<EOS>
:
let
her
reform
her
libertine
,
and
let
him
marry
her
;
and
be
he
of
princely
extraction

I
dare
answer
for
it
,
that
no
two
prince
in
one
age
,
take
the
world
through
,
would
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
for
,
although
I
be
sensible
it
be
not
to
my
credit
,
I
will
say
,
that
I
never
meet
with
a
repulse
,
nor
a
conduct
like
this
;
and
yet
I
never
sink
very
low
for
the
subject
of
my
attempt
,
either
at
home
or
abroad
.
<EOS>
these
be
obvious
inference
,
"
add
he
,
"
not
refinement
upon
my
Pamela
's
story
;
and
if
the
gentleman
be
capable
of
thought
and
comparison
,
would
rather
make
such
an
example
,
as
be
apprehend
,
more
than
less
difficult
than
before

but
if

indeed

the
young
fellow

such
a
booby

that
he
can
not
reflect
and
compare
,
and
take
the
case
with
all
its
circumstance
together
<EOS>
,
I
think
his
good
papa
or
mamma
should
get
him
a
wife
to
their
own
liking
,
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
the
poor
girl
in
England
,
who
be
honest
,
should
rather
bless
herself
for
escape
such
a
husband

than
glory
in
the
catch
she
would
have
of
him

he
would
hardly
do

indeed

down
quietly

notice

Sir

Mr.

afterwards
fall
into
a
family
discourse
;
and
Sir
Jacob
tell
us
of
two
or
three
courtship
by
his
three
son
,
and
to
his
two
daughter
,
and
his
reason
for
disallow
them
:
and
I
could
observe
,
he
be
an
absolute
tyrant
in
his
family
,
though
they
be
all
man
and
woman
grow
,
and
he
seem
to
please
himself
how
much
they
stand
in
awe
of
him

I
would
not
have
be
so
tediously
trifling

for
the
sake
of
my

parent

there
be
so
much
self

praise
,
as
it

seem

from
a

repeat
the
fine
thing
say
of

,
that
I
be
half
of
opinion
I
should
send
them
to
Kent
only

and
to
think
you
should
be
oblige
to

for
save
you
so
much
trouble
and
impertinence
.
  
<EOS>
do
,
dear
Miss

be
so
free
as
to
forbid
me
to
send
you
any
more
long
journal

common
letter
only

of
how
you
do

<EOS>
and
who

and
so
forth
 
letter
that
one
may
dispatch

as
Sir
Jacob
say
,
in
a

perhaps
be
more
to

purpose
than
the
tedious
scrawl

You
have
give
us
great
pleasure
in
your
account
of
your
conversation

of
the
verse
put
so
wickedly
under
your

in
your
just
observation
on
the
line

and
occasion

<EOS>
I
be
quite
shocked
,
when
I
think
of
Lady
Davers

passionate
intention
at
the
hall

have
let
nobody
into
the
bad

in

We
be
delighted
with
the

your
Sunday

an
excellent

you

evening
service

We
go
on
here
swimmingly
with
our
courtship

<EOS>
never
be
there
a
fonder
couple

Mr.

Miss
Nancy

<EOS>
the
modest
girl

quite
alive

easy

now

then
with
me

<EOS>
We
have
a
sad
fall
out
t'other
day
.
<EOS>
thus
it
be
:
 
She
have
the
assurance
,
on
my
saying
,
they
be
so
fond
and
free
before
-
hand
,
that
they
would
leave
nothing
for
improvement
afterwards
,
to
tell
me
,
she
have
long
perceive
,
that
my
envy
be
very
disquieting
to
me
.
<EOS>
this
she
say
before
Mr.
Murray
,
who
have
the
good
manner
to
retire
,
see
a
storm
rise
between
us
.
"

to
great
contempt

thee

that
it

I
see
it
vex
you

ill

<EOS>
but
,
dear
Polly
,
do
not

the
affection
Mr.

express

put
such
a

out

the

may
be
happy

interpret

proud
to
emulate
your
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
Mrs.
B.
,
there
can
be
no
live
with
these
man
upon
such
beginning
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
know
their
distance
,
or
be
teach
it
,
and
not
to
think
it
in
their
power
to
confer
that
as
a
favour
,
which
they
should
esteem
it
an
honour
to
receive
.
  
<EOS>
but
neither
can
I
bear
,
it
seem
,
the
preparative
to
matrimony
,
the
fine
clothe
,
the
compliment
,
the
busy
novelty
,
as
he
call
it
,
the
new
equipage
,
and
so
forth
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
his
mistake
again
,
tell
him
:
for
one
who
can
look
forwarder
than
the
nine
day
of
wonder
,
can
easily
despise
so
flashy
and
so
transient
a
glare
.
<EOS>
and
be
I
fond
of
compliment
,
it
would
not
,
perhaps
,
be
the
way
to
be
pleased
,
in
that
respect
,
if
I
be
to
marry
.
  
<EOS>
compliment
in
the
single
state
be
a
lady
's
due
,
whether
court
or
not
;
and
she
receive
,
or
ought
always
to
receive
them
,
as
such
;
but
in
courtship
they
be
pour
out
upon
one
,
like
a
hasty
shower
,
soon
to
be
over
.
<EOS>
a
mighty
comfortable
consideration
this
,
to
a
lady
who
love
to
be
compliment
!
<EOS>
instead
of
the
refresh
April
-
like
shower
,
which
beautify
the
sun
-
shine
,
she
shall
stand
a
deluge
of
complaisance
,
be
wet
to
the
skin
with
it
;
and
what
then
?
<EOS>
why
be
in
a
lybian
desert
ever
after
!
 
<EOS>
experience
a
constant
parching
drought
and
all
her
attribute
excellency
will
be
swallow
up
in
the
quicksand
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
otherwise
with
you
;
and
it
must
be
so
;
because
there
be
such
an
infinite
variety
in
your
excellence
.
<EOS>
but
do
Mr.
B.
think
it
must
be
so
in
every
matrimony
?
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
true
,
he
improve
every
hour
,
as
I
see
in
his
fine
speech
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
it
could
not
be
Mr.
B.
if
he
do
not
:
your
merit
extort
it
from
him
:
and
what
an
ungrateful
,
as
well
as
absurd
churl
,
would
he
be
,
who
should
seek
to
obscure
a
meridian
lustre
,
that
dazzle
the
eye
of
every
one
else
?
  
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
your
delightful
narrative
,
and
beg
you
to
continue
them
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
how
your
Saturday
's
conversation
with
Lady
Davers
,
and
your
Sunday
employment
,
charm
us
all
:
so
regular
,
and
so
easy
to
be
perform
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
delightful
thing
 
<EOS>
what
every
body
may
do;-and
yet
so
beautiful
,
so
laudable
,
so
uncommon
in
the
practice
,
especially
among
people
in
genteel
life
!
 
<EOS>
Your
conversation
and
decision
in
relation
to
the
two
parson
(
more
than
charm
)
transport
us
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
judge
right
,
and
act
a
charming
part
,
to
throw
such
a
fine
game
into
your
hand
.
<EOS>
and
so
excellently
do
you
play
it
,
that
you
do
as
much
credit
to
your
partner
's
judgment
as
to
your
own
.
<EOS>
never
be
so
happy
a
couple
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
be
more
my
favourite
than
ever
;
and
the
amply
reward
Mr.
Adams
,
how
do
that
scene
affect
us
!
<EOS>
again
and
again
,
I
say
(
for
what
can
I
say
else
or
more
 
since
I
can
not
find
word
to
speak
all
I
think
?
)
,
you
be
a
charming
lady
!
<EOS>
yet
,
methink
,
poor
Mr.
H.
make
but
a
sorry
figure
among
you
.
<EOS>
We
be
delighted
with
Lady
Davers
;
but
still
more
,
if
possible
,
with
the
countess
:
she
be
a
fine
lady
,
as
you
have
draw
her
:
but
your
character
,
though
truth
and
nature
,
be
the
most
shocking
,
or
the
most
amiable
,
that
I
ever
read
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
full
of
impatience
to
hear
of
the
arrival
of
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
.
<EOS>
We
know
his
character
pretty
well
:
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
sit
for
it
to
your
pencil
,
it
must
be
an
original
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
another
trial
with
my
papa
,
to
move
him
to
let
me
attend
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
rally
my
force
,
and
have
get
my
mamma
on
my
side
again
;
who
be
concerned
to
see
her
girl
vex
and
insult
by
her
young
sister
;
and
who
yet
mind
no
more
what
she
say
to
her
,
than
what
I
say
;
and
Sir
Simon
love
to
make
mischief
between
us
,
instead
of
interpose
to
silence
either
:
and
truly
,
I
be
afraid
his
delight
of
this
kind
will
make
him
deny
his
polly
<EOS>
what
she
so
ardently
wish
for
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
be
sick
,
to
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
fast
two
or
three
day
,
to
give
it
the
well
appearance
;
but
then
my
mamma
,
who
love
not
deceit
,
would
blame
me
,
if
she
know
my
stratagem
;
and
be
grieve
,
if
she
think
I
be
really
ill
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
fast
,
<EOS>
when
one
have
a
stomach
to
eat
,
give
one
a
very
gloomy
and
mortified
air
.
<EOS>
what
would
I
not
do
,
in
short
,
to
procure
to
myself
the
inexpressible
pleasure
that
I
should
have
in
your
company
and
conversation
?
<EOS>
but
continue
to
write
to
me
till
then
,
however
,
and
that
will
be
next
good
.
<EOS>
I
be
your
most
obliged
and
obedient
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
from
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
My
Dearest
Mrs.
B.
,
  
I
be
all
over
joy
and
rapture
.
<EOS>
My
good
papa
permit
me
to
say
,
that
he
will
put
his
Polly
under
your
protection
,
when
you
go
to
London
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
but
a
tenth
part
of
the
pleasure
I
have
on
this
occasion
,
I
be
sure
,
I
shall
be
as
welcome
as
I
wish
.
<EOS>
but
he
will
insist
upon
it
,
he
say
,
that
Mr.
B.
sign
some
acknowledgment
,
which
I
be
to
carry
along
with
me
,
that
I
be
intrust
to
his
honour
and
yours
,
and
to
be
return
to
him
heart
-
whole
and
dutiful
,
and
with
a
reputation
as
unsullied
as
he
receive
me
.
<EOS>
but
do
continue
your
journal
till
then
;
for
I
have
promise
to
take
them
up
where
you
leave
off
,
to
divert
our
friend
here
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
presumption
!
<EOS>
but
yet
I
will
write
nothing
but
what
I
will
shew
you
,
and
have
your
consent
to
send
!
<EOS>
for
I
be
teach
early
not
to
tell
tale
out
of
school
;
and
a
school
,
the
good
I
ever
go
to
,
will
be
your
charming
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
greatly
divert
with
the
trick
put
upon
that
barbarian
Sir
Jacob
.
<EOS>
His
obstinacy
,
repentance
,
and
amendment
,
follow
so
irresistibly
in
one
half
hour
,
from
the
happy
thought
of
the
excellent
lady
countess
,
that
I
think
no
plot
be
ever
more
fortunate
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
spring
a
lucky
mine
in
a
siege
,
that
blow
up
twenty
time
more
than
be
expect
from
it
,
and
answer
all
the
besieger
'
end
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
's
defence
of
his
own
conduct
towards
you
be
quite
noble
;
and
he
judge
with
his
usual
generosity
and
good
sense
,
when
,
by
add
to
your
honour
,
he
know
he
enhance
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
You
bid
me
skim
over
your
writing
lightly
;
but
'
tis
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
flatter
you
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
nor
will
I
be
suspect
to
do
so
;
and
yet
I
can
not
find
word
to
praise
,
so
much
as
I
think
you
deserve
:
<EOS>
so
I
will
only
say
that
your
good
parent
,
for
whose
pleasure
you
write
,
as
well
as
for
mine
,
can
not
receive
or
read
them
with
more
delight
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
even
my
sister
Nancy
(
judge
of
their
effect
by
this
!
)
<EOS>
will
at
any
time
leave
Murray
,
and
forget
to
frown
or
be
ill
-
natured
,
while
she
can
hear
read
what
you
write
.
<EOS>
and
,
angry
as
she
make
me
some
time
,
I
can
not
deny
her
this
pleasure
,
because
possibly
,
among
the
innumerable
improve
reflection
they
abound
with
,
some
one
may
possibly
dart
in
upon
her
,
and
illuminate
her
,
as
your
conversation
and
behaviour
do
Sir
Jacob
.
  
<EOS>
but
your
application
in
P.S.
to
my
papa
please
him
;
and
confirm
his
resolution
to
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
He
snatch
the
sheet
that
contain
this
,
"
that
be
to
me
,
"
say
he
:
"
I
must
read
this
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
do
,
and
say
,
"
She
be
a
sweet
one
:
"
do
dear
good
Sir
Simon
,
"
repeat
he
aloud
,
"
"
let
Miss
Polly
add
to
our
delight
!
"
<EOS>
so
she
shall
,
then
;
 
if
that
will
do
it
!
 
<EOS>
and
yet
this
same
Mrs.
B.
have
so
many
delight
already
,
that
I
should
think
she
may
be
content
.
<EOS>
but
,
Dame
Darnford
,
I
think
I
will
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
these
sister
then
,
you
will
see
,
how
they
will
love
at
a
distance
,
though
always
quarrel
when
together
.
"
<EOS>
He
read
on
,
"
<EOS>
"
the
new
affair
will
divert
you
 
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
have
consent
 
Miss
be
willing
;
and
her
sister
can
spare
her
;
"
 
very
prettily
put
,
faith
"
and
do
not
you
be
cross
"
 
<EOS>
v
ery
sweet
"
to
deny
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
why
,
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
I
will
not
be
so
cross
then
;
indeed
I
will
not
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
Polly
,
let
'em
send
word
when
they
set
out
for
London
,
and
you
shall
join
'em
there
with
all
my
heart
;
but
I
will
have
a
letter
every
post
,
remember
that
,
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
any
thing
,
any
thing
,
dear
papa
,
"
say
I
:
"
<EOS>
so
I
can
but
go
!
"
<EOS>
He
call
for
a
kiss
,
for
his
compliance
.
<EOS>
I
give
it
most
willingly
,
you
may
believe
.
  
<EOS>
Nancy
look
envious
,
although
Mr.
Murray
come
in
just
then
.
<EOS>
She
look
almost
like
a
great
glutton
,
whom
I
remember
;
one
Sir
Jonathan
Smith
,
who
kill
himself
with
eat
:
<EOS>
he
use
,
while
he
be
heap
up
his
plate
from
one
dish
,
to
watch
the
other
,
and
follow
the
knife
of
every
body
else
with
such
a
greedy
eye
,
as
if
he
could
swear
a
robbery
against
any
one
who
presume
to
eat
as
well
as
he
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
let
's
know
when
you
set
out
,
and
you
shall
not
have
be
a
week
in
London
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
but
you
shall
be
tell
by
my
tongue
,
as
now
by
my
pen
,
how
much
I
be
your
oblige
admirer
and
friend
,
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
my
dear
friend
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
proceed
with
my
journal
,
which
I
have
bring
down
to
Thursday
night
.
  
<EOS>
FRIDAY
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
lady
resolve
,
as
they
say
,
to
inspect
all
my
proceeding
,
insist
upon
it
,
that
I
would
take
them
with
me
in
my
benevolent
round
(
as
they
,
after
we
return
,
would
call
it
)
,
which
I
generally
take
once
a
week
,
among
my
poor
and
sick
neighbour
;
and
find
I
could
not
get
off
,
I
set
out
with
them
,
my
lady
countess
proposing
Mrs.
Worden
to
fill
up
the
fourth
place
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
We
talk
all
the
way
of
charity
,
and
the
excellence
of
that
duty
;
and
my
Lady
Davers
take
notice
of
the
text
,
that
it
would
hide
a
multitude
of
fault
.
  
<EOS>
the
countess
say
she
have
once
a
much
well
opinion
of
herself
,
than
she
find
she
have
reason
for
,
within
these
few
day
past
:
"
and
indeed
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
say
she
,
"
when
I
get
home
,
I
shall
make
a
good
many
people
the
well
for
your
example
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
say
Lady
Davers
;
which
give
me
no
small
inward
pleasure
;
and
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
,
in
suitable
term
,
the
honour
they
both
do
me
.
<EOS>
the
coach
set
us
down
by
the
side
of
a
large
common
,
about
five
mile
distant
from
our
house
;
and
we
alight
,
and
walk
a
little
way
,
choose
not
to
have
the
coach
come
nearer
,
that
we
may
be
take
as
little
notice
of
as
possible
;
and
they
enter
with
me
into
two
mean
cot
with
great
condescension
and
goodness
;
one
belong
to
a
poor
widow
and
five
child
,
who
have
be
all
down
in
ague
and
fever
;
the
other
to
a
man
and
his
wife
bed
-
rid
with
age
and
infirmity
,
and
two
honest
daughter
,
one
a
widow
with
two
child
,
the
other
marry
to
an
husbandman
,
who
have
also
be
ill
,
but
now
,
by
comfortable
cordial
,
and
good
physic
,
be
pretty
well
to
what
they
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
lady
be
well
pleased
with
my
demeanour
to
the
good
folk
:
to
whom
I
say
,
that
as
I
should
go
so
soon
to
London
,
I
be
willing
to
see
them
before
I
go
,
to
wish
them
better
and
better
,
and
to
tell
them
,
that
I
should
leave
order
with
Mrs.
Jervis
concern
them
,
to
whom
they
must
make
know
their
want
:
and
that
Mr.
Barrow
would
take
care
of
them
,
I
be
sure
;
and
do
all
that
be
in
the
power
of
physic
for
the
restoration
of
their
health
.
  
<EOS>
now
you
must
know
,
Miss
,
that
I
be
not
so
good
as
the
old
lady
of
former
day
,
who
use
to
distil
cordial
water
,
and
prepare
medicine
,
and
dispense
them
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
if
I
be
so
inclined
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
would
not
have
be
please
with
it
,
because
in
the
approbation
he
have
kindly
give
to
my
present
method
,
he
have
twice
or
thrice
praise
me
,
that
I
do
not
carry
my
charity
to
extreme
,
and
make
his
house
a
dispensatory
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
therefore
,
by

the
opportunity
of
do
any
good
at
all
in
these
respect
;
and
besides
,
as
the
vulgar
saying
be
,
one
must
creep
before
one
go
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
my
method
:
  
<EOS>
I
be
upon
an
agreement
with
this
Mr.
Barrow
,
who
be
deem
a
very
skilful
and
honest
apothecary
,
and
one
Mr.
Simmonds
,
a
surgeon
of
like
character
,
to
attend
to
all
such
case
and
person
as
I
shall
recommend
;
Mr.
Barrow
,
to
administer
physic
and
cordial
,
as
he
shall
judge
proper
,
and
even
,
in
necessary
case
,
to
call
in
a
physician
.
<EOS>
and
now
and
then
,
by
look
in
upon
them
one
's
self
,
or
send
a
servant
to
ask
question
,
all
be
keep
right
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lady
Davers
observe
a
Bible
,
a
Common
Prayer
-
book
,
and
a
whole
Duty
of
Man
,
in
each
cot
,
in
leathern
outside
case
,
to
keep
them
clean
,
and
a
Church
Catechism
or
two
for
the
child
;
and
be
pleased
to
say
,
it
be
right
;
and
her
ladyship
ask
one
of
the
child
,
a
pretty
girl
,
who
learn
her
her
catechism
?
<EOS>
and
she
curtsey'd
and
look
at
me
;
for
I
do
ask
the
child
question
,
when
I
come
,
to
know
how
they
improve
;
"
'
Tis
as
I
think
,
"
say
my
lady
;
"
my
sister
provide
for
both
part
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
and
tap
my
neck
.
  
<EOS>
My
lady
leave
token
of
their
bounty
behind
them
to
both
family
,
and
all
the
good
folk
bless
and
pray
for
us
at
parting
:
and
as
we
go
out
,
my
Lady
Davers
,
with
a
serious
air
,
be
pleased
to
say
to
me
,
"
take
care
of
your
health
,
my
dear
sister
;
and
God
give
you
,
when
it
come
,
a
happy
hour
:
<EOS>
for
how
many
real
mourner
would
you
have
,
if
you
be
to
be
call
early
to
reap
the
fruit
of
your
piety
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
's
will
must
be
do
,
my
lady
,
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
the
same
Providence
that
have
so
wonderfully
put
it
in
my
power
to
do
a
little
good
,
will
raise
up
new
friend
to
the
honest
heart
that
rely
upon
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
I
say
,
because
some
of
the
good
people
hear
my
lady
,
and
seem
troubled
,
and
begin
to
redouble
their
prayer
,
for
my
safety
and
preservation
.
  
<EOS>
We
walk
thence
to
our
coach
,
and
stretch
a
little
farther
,
to
visit
two
farmer
'
family
,
about
a
mile
distant
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
one
have
the
mother
of
the
family
,
with
two
son
,
just
recover
,
the
former
from
a
fever
,
the
latter
from
tertian
ague
;
and
I
ask
,
when
they
see
Mr.
Barrow
?
<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
with
great
commendation
of
him
,
that
he
have
but
just
leave
them
.
<EOS>
so
,
have
congratulate
their
hopeful
way
,
and
wish
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
,
and
not
go
too
early
to
business
,
I
say
I
should
desire
Mr.
Barrow
to
watch
over
them
,
for
fear
of
a
relapse
,
and
should
hardly
see
'em
again
for
some
time
;
and
so
I
slide
,
in
a
manner
not
to
be
observe
,
a
couple
of
guinea
into
the
good
woman
's
hand
;
for
I
have
a
hint
give
me
by
Mrs.
Jervis
,
that
their
illness
have
make
it
low
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
proceed
then
to
the
other
farm
,
where
the
case
be
a
married
daughter
,
who
have
a
very
dangerous
lying
-
in
,
and
a
wicked
husband
who
have
abuse
her
,
and
run
away
from
her
;
but
she
be
mend
apace
,
by
good
comfortable
thing
,
which
from
time
to
time
I
have
cause
to
be
send
her
.
<EOS>
Her
old
father
have
be
a
little
unkind
to
her
,
before
I
take
notice
of
her
;
for
she
marry
against
his
consent
;
and
indeed
the
world
go
hard
with
the
poor
man
,
and
he
could
not
do
much
;
and
besides
,
he
have
a
young
daughter
,
who
have
lose
all
her
limb
,
and
be
force
to
be
tie
in
a
wicker
chair
,
to
keep
her
up
in
it
;
which
(
have
expend
much
to
relieve
her
)
be
a
great
pull
-
back
,
as
the
good
old
woman
call
it
.
<EOS>
and
have
be
a
year
in
arrear
to
a
harsh
landlord
,
who
,
find
a
good
stock
upon
the
ground
,
threaten
to
distress
the
poor
family
,
and
turn
them
out
of
all
,
I
advance
the
money
upon
the
stock
;
and
the
poor
man
have
already
pay
me
half
of
it
(
for
,
Miss
<EOS>
,
I
must
keep
within
compass
too
)
,
which
be
fifty
pound
at
first
,
and
be
in
a
fair
way
to
pay
me
the
other
half
,
and
make
as
much
more
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
find
Mr.
Barrow
,
and
he
give
me
an
account
of
the
success
of
two
other
case
I
have
recommend
to
him
;
and
tell
me
,
that
John
Smith
,
a
poor
man
,
who
,
in
thatch
a
barn
,
have
tumble
down
,
and
break
his
leg
,
and
bruise
himself
all
over
,
be
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
this
poor
creature
have
like
to
have
perish
by
the
cruelty
of
the
parish
officer
,
who
would
have
pass
him
away
to
Essex
,
where
his
settlement
be
,
though
in
a
burn
fever
,
occasion
by
his
misfortune
;
but
hearing
of
the
case
,
I
direct
Mr.
Simmonds
to
attend
him
,
and
to
provide
for
him
at
my
expense
,
and
give
my
word
,
if
he
die
,
to
bury
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
he
be
in
so
good
a
way
,
and
tell
Mr.
Barrow
,
I
hope
to
see
him
and
Mr.
Simmonds
together
at
Mr.
B.
's
,
before
I
set
out
for
London
,
that
we
may
advise
about
the
case
under
their
direction
,
and
that
I
may
acquit
myself
of
some
of
my
obligation
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
good
man
,
Mr.
Barrow
,
"
add
I
:
"
God
will
bless
you
for
your
care
and
kindness
to
these
poor
destitute
creature

<EOS>
They
all
praise
you

do
nothing
but
talk
of
your
humanity
to
them

<EOS>
o
my
good
lady
,
"
say
he
,
"
who
can
forbear
follow
such
an
example
as
you
set
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Simmonds
can
testify
as
well
as
I
(
for
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
case
require
us
to
visit
together
)
that
we
can
hardly
hear
any
complaint
from
our
poor
patient
,
let
'em
be
ever
so
ill
,
for
the
praise
and
blessing
they
bestow
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
good
Mr.
B.
that
enable
and
encourage
me
to
do
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
tell
them
,
they
must
bless
God
,
and
bless
him
,
and
pray
for
me
,
and
thank
you
and
Mr.
Simmonds
:
we
all
join
together

you
know

for
their
good

"
  
<EOS>
the
countess
and
Lady
Davers
ask
the
poor
lying
-
in
woman
many
question
,
and
leave
with
her
,
and
for
her
poor
sister
,
a
miserable
object
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
(
God
be
praise
that
I
be
not
such
an

<EOS>
mark
of
their
bounty
in
gold
,
and
look
upon
one
another

and
then
upon
me
,
and
<EOS>
lift
up
their
hand
,
could
not
say
a
word
till
we
be
in
the
coach
:
and
so
we
be
carry
home
,
after
we
have
just
look
in
upon
a
country
school
,
where
I
pay
for
the
learning
of
eight
child

and
here
(
I
hope
I

with
pride

though
I
do
with
pleasure
)
be
a
cursory
account
of
my
benevolent
weekly
round
,
as
my
lady
will
call
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
not
be
displeased
with
it
;
but
it
will
highly
delight
my
worthy
parent
,
who
,
in
their
way
,
do
a
great
deal
of
discreet
good
in
their
neighbourhood
:
for
indeed
,
Miss

a
little
matter
,
prudently
bestow
,
and
on
true
object
of
compassion
(
whose
case
be
soon
at
a
crisis
,
as
be
those
of
most
labour
people
)
,
will
go
a
great
way
,
and
especially
if
lay
out
properly
for
'em
,
accord
to
the
exigency
of
their
respective
case
.
 
<EOS>
for
such
poor
people
,
who
live
generally
low
,
want
very
seldom
any
thing
but
revive
cordial
at
first
,
and
good
wholesome
kitchen
physic
afterwards
:
and
then
the
wheel
of
nature
,
be
unclogged
<EOS>
,
new
oil

as
it
be
,
and
set
right
,
they
will
go
round
again
with
pleasantness
and
ease
for
a
good
while
together
,
by
virtue
of
that
exercise
which
their
labour
give
them
;
while
the
rich

voluptuous

undergo
great
fatigue
to
keep
theirs
clean

<EOS>
SATURDAY
morning
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
right
to
trouble
either
of
you
,
my
honoured
correspondent
,
with
an
affair
that
have
vex
me
a
good
deal
;
and
,
indeed
,
should
affect
me
more
than
any
other
mistress
of
a
family
,
for
reason
which
will
be
obvious
to
you
,
when
I
tell
you
the
case
.
<EOS>
and
this
I
can
not
forbear
do
.
  
<EOS>
a
pretty
genteel
young
body
,
my
polly
Barlow
,
as
I
call
her
,
have
be
well
recommend
,
and
behave
with
great
prudence
till
this
time
,
be
the
cause
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B.
and
the
two
lady
,
agree
with
me
to
take
a
little
airing
in
the
coach
,
and
to
call
in
upon
Mr.
Martin
,
who
have
a
present
make
him
for
his
menagerie
,
in
which
he
take
a
great
delight
,
of
a
rare
and
uncommon
creature
,
a
native
of
the
East
Indies
.
<EOS>
but
just
as
Sir
Jacob
be
on
horseback
to
accompany
them
,
and
the
lady
be
ready
to
go
,
I
be
take
with
a
sudden
disorder
and
faintishness
;
so
that
Lady
Davers
,
who
be
very
tender
of
me
,
and
watch
every
change
of
my
countenance
,
would
not
let
me
go
with
them
,
though
my
disorder
be
go
off
:
and
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
be
pleased
to
excuse
me
;
and
just
meet
with
Mr.
Williams
,
as
they
go
to
the
coach
,
they
take
him
with
them
,
to
fill
up
the
vacant
place
.
<EOS>
so
I
retire
to
my
closet
,
and
shut
myself
in
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
ask
Mr.
H.
to
go
with
them
,
for
company
to
Sir
Jacob
;
but
he
(
on
purpose
,
as
I
believe
by
what
follow
)
could
not
be
find
,
when
they
set
out
:
so
they
suppose
he
be
upon
some
ramble
with
Mr.
Colbrand
,
his
great
favourite
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
write
to
you
,
be
pretty
well
recover
,
when
I
hear
Polly
,
as
I
suppose
,
and
as
it
prove
,
come
into
my
apartment
:
<EOS>
and
down
she
sit
,
and
sing
a
little
catch
,
and
cry
,
"
hem
!
"
<EOS>
twice
;
and
presently
I
hear
two
voice
.
<EOS>
but
suspect
nothing
,
I
write
on
,
till
I
hear
a
kind
of
rustling
and
struggle
,
and
Polly
's
voice
cry
,
"
fie
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
do
so
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
alarm
me
much
,
because
we
have
such
orderly
folk
about
us
;
and
I
look
through
the
key
-
hole
;
and
,
to
my
surprise
and
concern
,
see
Mr.
H.
 
foolish
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
take
liberty
with
Polly
,
that
neither
become
him
to
offer
,
nor
,
more
foolish
girl
!
<EOS>
her
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
and
have
reason
to
think
,
that
this
be
not
their
first
interview
,
and
freedom
 
and
the
girl
sometimes
encouragingly
laugh
,
as
at
other
time
,
inconsistently
,
struggle
and
complain
,
in
an
accent
that
be
too
tender
for
the
occasion
,
I
force
a
faint
cough
.
<EOS>
this
fright
them
both
:
Mr.
H.
swear
,
and
say
,
"
who
can
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
Your
lady
be
go
with
them
,
be
not
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
!
"
say
the
silly
girl
 
"
yet
that
be
like
her
voice
!
 
<EOS>
Me'm
,
be
you
in
your
closet
,
me'm

"
<EOS>
say
she
,
come
up
to
the
door
;
Mr.
H.
stand
like
a
poor
thief
,
half
behind
the
window
-
curtain
,
till
he
know
whether
it
be
I.
  
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
:
away
sneak
Mr.
H.
,
and
she
leap
with
surprise
,
not
hope
to
find
me
there
,
though
she
ask
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
 
<EOS>
indeed
 
<EOS>
me'm
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
be
go
out
,
"
 
"
It
be
plain
you
do
,
Polly
.
 
<EOS>
go
and
shut
the
chamber
door
,
and
come
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
,
but
tremble
,
and
be
so
full
of
confusion
,
that
I
pity
the
poor
creature
,
and
hardly
know
how
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
for
my
compassion
get
the
upper
hand
of
my
resentment
;
and
as
she
stand
quake
and
tremble
,
and
look
on
the
ground
with
a
countenance
I
can
not
describe
,
I
now
and
then
cast
my
eye
upon
her
,
and
be
as
often
force
to
put
my
handkerchief
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
I
say
,
"
how
long
have
these
freedom
past
between
you
and
Mr.
H.
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
loth
to
be
censorious

Polly
;
but
it
be
too
plain
,
that
Mr.
H.
would
not
have
follow
you
into
my
chamber

if
he
have
not

<EOS>
the
poor

never

little
do
I
expect

so
much
imprudence

You

instance

the
vile
art

I

by

poor

how
true
lover
be
to
their
secret

though
,
perhaps
,
their
ruin
depend
upon
keep
it

it
behove
me
,
on
many
account

to
examine
this
matter
narrowly
;
because
if
Mr.
H.
should
marry
her
,
it
would
have
be
lay
upon
Mr.
B.

example

if
Polly
be
ruin

it
would
be
a
sad
thing
,
and
people
would
have
say
,
"
aye
,
she
could
take
care
enough
of
herself

none
at
all
of

her

maid

more
remiss

thus

"
well
,
Polly

I
see
,
"
continue
I
,
"
that
you
will
not

out

<EOS>
You
may
have
several
reason
for
it

possibly
,
though
not
one
good
one

as
soon

in

wring
her

look
sadly

I
pity
her

yet
be
angry
in

I
see

too
plainly

scrutiny

not

all

with

why
then

Madam

she
throw
herself
at

hide
her
face
with

apron

I
be
in
agony

estate
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
conceal
the
matter
from
Lady
Davers
,
if
she
would
not
,
by
her
promise
to
be
govern
entirely
by
me
,
and
to
abandon
all
thought
of
Mr.
H.
,
give
me
room
to
conclude
,
that
the
wicked
bargain
be
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
and
to
keep
the
poor
creature
in
some
spirit
,
and
to
enable
her
to
look
up
,
and
to
be
more
easy
under
my
direction
,
I
blame
him
more
than
I
do
her
:
<EOS>
though
,
consider
what
virtue
require
of
a
woman
,
and
custom
have
make
shameless
in
a
man
,
I
think
the
poor
girl
inexcusable
,
and
shall
not
be
easy
while
she
be
about
me
.
<EOS>
for
she
be
more
to
blame
,
because
,
of
the
two
,
she
have
more
wit
than
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
can
I
do
?
"
think
I.
"
<EOS>
if
I
put
her
away
,
'
twill
be
to
throw
her
directly
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
stay
here
long
:
and
she
may
see
her
folly
.
<EOS>
but
yet
her
eye
be
open
;
she
know
what
she
have
to
trust
to
 
and
by
their
wicked
beginning
,
and
her
encouraging
repulse
,
I
doubt
she
would
have
be
utterly
ruin
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
know
the
rage
Lady
Davers
would
be
in
with
both
.
<EOS>
so
this
be
another
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
yet
should
my
good
intention
fail
,
and
they
conclude
their
vile
bargain
,
and
it
appear
that
I
know
of
it
,
but
would
not
acquaint
her
,
then
should
I
have
be
more
blame
than
any
mistress
of
a
family
,
circumstance
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
resolve
to
comfort
the
girl
as
well
as
I
could
,
till
I
have
gain
her
confidence
,
that
my
advice
may
have
the
more
weight
,
and
,
by
degree
,
be
more
likely
to
reclaim
her
:
for
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
there
would
be
an
end
of
her
reputation
,
the
most
precious
of
all
jewel
,
the
moment
the
matter
be
know
;
and
that
would
be
a
sad
thing
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
man
,
I
think
it
best
to
take
courage
(
and
you
,
that
know
me
,
will
say
,
I
must
have
a
good
deal
more
than
usual
)
to
talk
to
Mr.
H.
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
and
she
consent
I
should
,
and
,
with
great
protestation
,
declare
her
sorrow
and
repentance
,
beg
to
get
her
note
of
hand
again
,
and
to
give
him
back
his
note
of
fifty
pound
<EOS>
,
I
go
down
to
find
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
shun
me
,
as
a
thief
would
a
constable
at
the
head
of
a
hue
-
and
-
cry
.
<EOS>
as
I
enter
one
room
,
he
go
into
another
,
look
with
conscious
guilt
,
yet
confidently
hum
a
tune
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
fix
him
,
bid
Rachel
tell
<EOS>
Polly
be
want
to
send
a
message
by
her
to
her
lady
.
<EOS>
by
which
I
doubt
not
he
be
desirous
to
know
what
she
have
own
,
in
order
to
govern
himself
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
His
back
be
towards
me
;
and
I
say
   
"
Mr.
H.
,
here
I
be
myself
,
to
take
your
command
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
give
a
caper
half
a
yard
high
 
<EOS>
"
Madam

I
want
 
I
want

"
You
want
to
send
Polly
to
me
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
H.

to
ask
if
I
would
take
a
little
walk
with
you
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
true
,
Madam

<EOS>
very
true
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
guess
the
matter

<EOS>
I
think
it
be
pity
,
this
fine
day
,
as
every

be
take
air

"
<EOS>
well
then
.
<EOS>
Sir

please
to
lead
the
way

I
will
attend
you

<EOS>

yet
I
fancy
,
Madam

the
wind
be
a
little
too
high
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
will
not
you
catch
cold
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
never
fear
,
Mr.
H.

I
be
not
afraid
of
a
little
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
attend
you
presently
,
Madam
:
<EOS>
you
will
be
in
the
great
gravel
walk
,
or
on
the
terrace
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
wait
upon
you
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
courage
to
take
hold
of
his
arm
,
as
if
I
have
like
to
have
slipt
.
 
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
,
think
I
,
thou
shalt
not
see
the
girl
till
I
have
talk
to
thee
a
little
,
if
thou
dost
then
.
 
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
Mr.
H.
 
I
hope
I
have
not
hurt
my
foot
 
<EOS>
I
must
lean
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
pleased
,
Madam
,
to
have
a
chair
?
<EOS>
I
fear
you
have
sprain
your
foot

Shall
I
help
you
to
a
chair

"
<EOS>
no

no
,
Sir
,
I
shall
walk
it
off
,
if
I
hold
by
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
he
have
no
excuse
to
leave
me
,
and
we
proceed
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
but
never
do
any
thing
look
so
like
a
foolish
fellow
,
as
his
aunt
call
him
.
<EOS>
He
look
,
if
possible
,
half
a
dozen
way
at
once
,
hemm'd
,
cough
,
turn
his
head
behind
him
every
now
and
then
,
start
half
a
dozen
silly
subject
,
in
hope
to
hinder
me
from
speak
.
  
<EOS>
I
appear
,
I
believe
,
under
some
concern
how
to
begin
with
him
;
for
he
would
have
it
<EOS>
I
be
not
very
well
,
and
beg
he
may
step
in
one
minute
to
desire
Mrs.
Jervis
to
attend
me
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
resolve
to
begin
with
him
;
lest
I
should
lose
the
opportunity
,
see
my
eel
so
very
slippery
.
<EOS>
and
place
myself
on
a
seat
,
ask
him
to
sit
down
.
<EOS>
He
decline
,
and
would
wait
upon
me
presently
,
he
say
,
and
seem
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
so
I
begin
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
easy
for
me
,
Mr.
H.

to
penetrate
into
the
reason
why
you
be
so
willing

leave
me
:
but
'
tis
for
your
own
sake
,
that
I
desire
you
to
hear
me

liberty

<EOS>

Mr.

I

I

kiss'd
a

Tis
not

to
proceed

particular
with
a

can

I
must
say

that
the

frolic

I

<EOS>
why

comical

nothing

on

<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
be
oblige

deal
thus
with
you

I
think
I
be
talk
to
a
gentleman
who
would
not
forfeit
his
veracity
;

that
in
so
solemn
an
instance
as
this

<EOS>
He
look
like
a
man
thunderstruck

<EOS>
His
face
be
distort

his
head
seem
to
turn
about
upon
his
neck

like
a

cock
in

to
all
point

his
hand
clench
as
in
a
passion

yet
shame

confusion
struggle
in
every
limb

feature

<EOS>
at
last
he
say
,
"
I
be
confoundedly
betray

if
I

never

'
<EOS>
tis
true

I
have
a
design
upon
her
;
and
since
she
have
betray
me
,
I
think
I
may
say
,
that
she
be
as
willing

almost
,
as
i.

ungenerous

contemptible

"
<EOS>
think
I
 
"
but
such
of
our
sex
as
can
thus
give
up
their
virtue
,
ought
to
expect
no
better
:
for
he
that
stick
not
at
one
bad
action

will
not
scruple
at
another

vindicate
himself

so

become
the
attempter

the
accuser
too

if
you
will
be
so
good

say
he
,
with
hand
uplifted

as
to
take
no
notice

this
to
my
uncle

to

by

not

as
an

give
me
back

doubt
it

you
say

to
make
it
know

will
only
expose

it

do
no

I
tell

could
observe

add
I

in
that
case
I
should
owe
it
to
myself

to
Mr.
B.
,
to
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
to
you
,
and
the
unhappy

too

to
do
so

"
  
<EOS>
He
would
needs
drop
down
on
one
knee
,
to
promise
this
;
and
with
a
thousand
acknowledgment
,
leave
me
to
find
Mr.
Colbrand
,
in
order
to
ride
to
meet
the
coach
on
its
return
.
<EOS>
I
go
in
,
and
give
the
foolish
note
to
the
silly
girl
,
which
she
receive
eagerly
,
and
immediately
burn
;
and
I
tell
her
,
I
would
not
suffer
her
to
come
near
me
but
as
little
as
possible
,
when
I
be
in
company
while
Mr.
H.
staid
;
but
consign
her
entirely
to
the
care
of
Mrs.
Jervis
,
to
whom
only
,
I
say
,
I
would
hint
the
matter
as
tenderly
as
I
could
:
and
for
this
,
I
add
,
I
have
more
reason
than
one
;
first
,
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
a
good
gentlewoman
's
advice
,
to
which
I
have
myself
formerly
be
behold
,
and
from
whom
I
conceal
nothing
;
next
,
to
keep
out
of
Mr.
H.
's
way
;
and
lastly
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
,
from
Mrs.
Jervis
's
opinion
,
to
judge
of
the
sincerity
of
her
repentance
:
<EOS>
"
for
,
Polly
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
must
imagine
,
so
regular
and
uniform
as
all
our
family
be
,
and
so
good
as
I
think
all
the
people
about
me
be
,
that
I
could
not
suspect
,
that
she
,
the
duty
of
whose
place
make
her
near
to
my
person
,
be
the
farth
from
what
I
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
set
this
matter
so
strongly
before
her
,
and
Mrs.
Jervis
have
so
well
second
me
,
that
I
hope
the
good
;
for
the
grief
the
poor
creature
carry
in
her
look
,
and
express
in
her
word
,
can
not
be
describe
;
frequently
accuse
herself
,
with
tear
,
say
often
to
Mrs.
Jervis
<EOS>
,
she
be
not
worthy
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
her
mistress
,
whose
example
she
have
make
so
bad
an
use
of
,
and
whose
lesson
she
have
so
ill
followed
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sadly
troubled
at
this
matter
,
however
;
but
I
take
great
comfort
in
reflect
that
my
sudden
indisposition
look
like
a
providential
thing
,
which
may
save
one
poor
soul
,
and
be
a
seasonable
warning
to
her
,
as
long
as
she
live
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
I
must
observe
,
that
at
supper
last
night
,
Mr.
H.
look
abject
and
mean
,
and
like
a
poor
thief
,
as
I
think
,
and
conscious
of
his
disappoint
folly
(
though
I
seldom
glance
my
eye
upon
him
)
,
have
less
to
say
for
himself
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
and
once
my
Lady
Davers
,
laughing
,
say
,
"
I
think
in
my
heart
,
my
nephew
look
more
foolish
every
time
I
see
him
,
than
the
last

"
<EOS>
He
steal
a
look
at
me
,
and
blush
;
and
my
lord
say
,
"
Jackey

some
grace

Sir

,

become
a

in
Mr.

only

,
"
his

<EOS>
"
thank
you

Madam

"
be
all
he
say
,
bow
to
his
aunt
,
and
affect
a
careless
yet
confused
air
,
as
if
he
whisper
a
whistle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
,
wretch

"
<EOS>
think
I
,
"
see
what
it

a
condemn
conscience

every
innocent

erect

<EOS>
but
yet
it
be
not
the
shame
of
a
bad
action
,
I
doubt
,
but
be
discover
and
disappoint
,
that
give
him
his
confusion
of
face
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
sad
thing
for
a
person
to
be
guilty
of
such
action
,
as
shall
put
it
in
the
power
of
another
,
even
by
a
look

to
mortify
him
!
<EOS>
and
if
poor
soul
can
be
thus
abjectly
strike
at
such
a
discovery
by
a
fellow
-
creature
,
how
must
they
appear
before
an
unerring
and
omniscient
Judge
,
with
a
conscience
stand
in
the
place
of
a
thousand
witness
?
<EOS>
and
call
in
vain
upon
the
mountain
to
fall
upon
them
,
and
the
hill
to
cover
them

<EOS>
how
serious
this
subject
make
one

SATURDAY

I

I
think
,
Sir

I
have
one
of

I
will

<EOS>
They
come
in
when
dinner
be
near
ready
,
and
the
four
gentleman
take
each
a
large
bumper
of
old
hock
for
another
whet

<EOS>
the
countess

<EOS>
Mr.

,
in
his
usual
kind

encouraging
manner

take
my

present

<EOS>
Sir

say
,
pretty
bluntly

that

hope

more

than

I
think
this

deserve

tea
and
coffee
by
ourselves
;
only
Mr.
B.
(
upon
our
invite
the
gentleman
to
partake
with
us
)
slide
in
for
a
few
minute
to
tell
us
,
they
would
stick
by
what
they
have
,
and
take
a
dish
of
coffee
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
omit
one
observation
;
that
Sir
Jacob
,
when
they
be
go
,
say
they
be
pure
company
;
and
Mr.
H.
that
he
never
be
so
delighted
in
his
bear
day
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
two
lady
put
up
their
prayer
,
that
they
may
never
have
such
another
entertainment
.
<EOS>
and
be
encourage
by
their
declaration
,
I
presume
to
join
in
the
same
petition
.
  
<EOS>
yet
it
seem
,
these
be
man
of
wit
!
<EOS>
I
believe
they
must
be
so
 
<EOS>
for
I
could
neither
like
nor
understand
them
.
<EOS>
yet
,
if
their
conversation
have
much
wit
,
I
should
think
my
lady
would
have
find
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
permit
me
to
add
,
go
away
very
merry
,
to
ride
ten
mile
by
owl
-
light
;
for
they
would
not
accept
of
bed
here
.
<EOS>
They
have
two
french
horn
with
them
,
and
give
us
a
flourish
or
two
at
go
off
.
<EOS>
each
have
a
servant
besides
:
but
the
way
they
be
in
would
have
give
me
more
concern
than
it
do
,
have
they
be
relate
to
Mr.
B.
and
less
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
it
be
a
happiness
,
that
such
gentleman
take
no
more
care
than
they
generally
do
,
to
interest
any
body
intimately
in
their
health
and
preservation
;
for
these
be
all
single
man
.
<EOS>
nor
need
the
public
,
any
more
than
the
private
,
be
much
concerned
about
them
;
for
let
such
person
go
when
they
will
,
if
they
continue
single
,
their
next
heir
can
not
well
be
a
bad
commonwealth
's
man
;
and
there
be
a
great
chance
he
may
be
well
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
I
end
my
Saturdays
seriously
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
to
what
I
have
already
say

<EOS>
He
kindly
would
have

nobody

<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
right
,
you
know
,
Miss
,
that
Mr.
B.
should
think
so
,
though
I
must
know
nothing
at
all
,
if
I
be
not
sensible
how
inferior
I
be
to
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
:
and
yet
,
when
I
look
abroad
now
-
and
-
then
,
I
could
be
a
proud
slut
,
if
I
would
,
and
not
yield
the
palm
to
many
other
.
  
<EOS>
well

my

SUNDAY
  
be
past

go

as
happy

the

the

and
,
at
their
earnest
request

Sir
Jacob
bear
us
company

<EOS>
My

with
her

break
almost
,
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
put
her
in
a
corner
of
my
closet

that
her
concern
should
not

<EOS>
Mrs.

<EOS>
Sir

be
much
pleased

order

and
say
,
'
twas
no
wonder
I
keep
so
good
myself

and
make
other
so
:
and
he
think
the
four
rake
(
for
he
run
on
how
much
they
admire
me
)
would
be
convert
,
if
they
see
how

I
pass
my
time
,
and
how
cheerful
and
easy
every
one
,
as
well
as
myself
be
under
it
!
<EOS>
He
say
,
when
he
come
home
,
he
must
take
such
a
method
himself
in
his
family
;
for
,
he
believe
,
it
would
make
not
only
well
master
and
mistress
,
but
well
child
,
and
well
servant
too
.
<EOS>
but
,
poor
gentleman

<EOS>
he
have
,
I
doubt
,
a
great
deal
to

in
his

<EOS>
You
must
know

I
pass
over
the

thus
swiftly
,
not
that
I
could
not
fill
them
up
with
writing
,
as
amply
as
I
have
do
the
former
;
but
intend
only
to
give
you
a
general
idea
of
our
way
of
life
and
conversation
;
and
have
go
through
a
whole
week
and
more
,
you
will
be
able
,
from
what
I
have
recite
,
to
form
a
judgment
how
it
be
with
us
,
one
day
with
another
.
<EOS>
as
for
example
,
now
and
then
neighbourly
visit

pay
 
Needlework

Cards

though
I

my

Mr.
B.

my
two
good

<EOS>
a
lesson
from
him
,
when
alone

either
in
French

Latin
 
<EOS>
a
new
pauper
case
or

a
visit
from
the
good
dean
 
Mr.
Williams
's
departure

in
order
to
put
the
new
project
alteration
in
force

which
be
to
deprive
me
of
my
chaplain
<EOS>
(
by
the
way

be
highly
pleased
with
this
affair
,
and
the
motive
to
it

<EOS>
Mr.
Adams

a
favourite
of
his

and
a
distant
relation
of
his

)
 
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
's
and
Polly
's
mutual
endeavour
to
avoid
one
another
 
<EOS>
My
lesson
to
the
poor
girl
,
and
caution
,
as
if
she
be
my
sister
   
these
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
and
my
honoured
parent
,
be
the
pleasant
employment
of
our
time
;
so
far
as
we
female
be
concern
:
for
the
gentleman
hunt
,
ride
out
,
and
divert
themselves
in
their
way
,
and
bring
us
home
the
news
and
occurrence
they
meet
with
abroad
,
and
now
-
and
-
then
a
straggle
gentleman
they
pick
up
in
their
diversion
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
shall
not
enlarge
upon
these
article
,
after
the
tedious
specimen
<EOS>
I
have
already
give
.
  
<EOS>
WEDNESDAY
,
THURSDAY
.
  
<EOS>
Could
you
ever
have
think
,
my
dear
,
that
husband
have
a
dispense
power
over
their
wife
,
which
king
be
not
allow
over
the
law
?
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
smart
debate
with
Mr.
B.
,
and
I
fear
it
will
not
be
the
only
one
upon
this
subject
.
<EOS>
Can
you
believe
,
that
if
a
wife
think
a
thing
her
duty
to
do
,
which
her
husband
do
not
approve
,
he
can
dispense
with
her
perform
it
,
and
no
sin
shall
lie
at
her
door
?
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
maintain
this
point
.
<EOS>
I
have
great
doubt
about
it
;
particularly
one
;
that
if
a
matter
be
my
duty
,
and
he
dispense
with
my
performance
of
it
,
whether
,
even
although
that
be
to
clear
me
of
the
sin
,
it
will
not
fall
upon
himself
?
<EOS>
and
a
good
wife
would
be
as
much
concerned
at
this
,
as
if
it
be
to
remain
upon
her
.
<EOS>
yet
he
seem
set
upon
it
.
<EOS>
what
can
one
do
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
notion
,
before
?
<EOS>
of
such
a
prerogative
in
a
husband
?
<EOS>
Would
you
care
to
subscribe
to
it
?
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
lady
be
of
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
they
be
,
and
so
will
not
ask
them
.
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
,
I
may
not
live
,
and
other
thing
may
happen
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
will
say
no
more
of
it
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
FRIDAY

what

<EOS>
You
will
allow
it
to
be
an
original
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
yet
,
may

be
not

<EOS>
for
it
may
be
as
well
write

and
as
sensible
a
letter
as
this
class
of
people
generally
write
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.

dress
well

be
not
a
contemptible
figure
of
a
man

laugh
,
talk
,
where
he
can
be
hear
,
and
his
aunt
be
not
present
;
and
cut
,
to
use
his
own
word
,
a
considerable
figure
in
a
country
town

<EOS>
but
see
 
<EOS>
yet
I
will
not
say
what
I
may
 
<EOS>
He
be
Lord
Davers
's
nephew
;
and
if
he
make
his
observation
,
and
forbear
his
speech
(
I
mean
,
can
be
silent
,
and
only
laugh
when
he
see
somebody
of
more
sense
laugh
,
and
never
approve
or
condemn
but
in
lead
-
string
)
,
he
may
possibly
pass
in
a
crowd
of
gentleman
.
<EOS>
but
poor
,
poor
polly
Barlow
!
<EOS>
what
can
I
say
for
Polly
Barlow
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
time
in
view
,
when
my
paper
may
fall
under
the
inspection
of
a
dear
gentleman
,
to
whom
,
next
to
God
,
I
be
accountable
for
all
my
action
and
correspondence
;
so
I
will
either
write
an
account
of
the
matter
,
and
seal
it
up
separately
,
for
Mr.
B.
,
or
,
at
a
fit
opportunity
,
break
it
to
him
,
and
let
him
know
(
under
secrecy
,
if
he
will
promise
it
)
<EOS>
the
step
I
take
in
it
;
lest
something
arise
hereafter
,
when
I
can
not
answer
for
myself
,
to
render
any
thing
dark
or
questionable
in
it
.
<EOS>
a
method
,
I
believe
,
very
proper
to
be
take
by
every
married
lady
;
and
I
presume
the
rather
to
say
so
,
have
have
a
good
example
for
it
:
for
I
have
often
think
of
a
little
seal
up
parcel
of
paper
,
my
lady
make
me
burn
in
her
presence
,
about
a
month
before
she
die
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
,
Pamela
,
"
say
she
,
"
such
as
would
not
concern
me
,
let
who
will
see
them
,
could
they
know
the
spring
and
cause
of
them
;
but
,
for
want
of
a
clue
,
my
son
may
be
at
a
loss
what
to
think
of
several
of
those
letter
be
he
to
find
them
,
in
look
over
my
other
paper
,
when
I
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
let
me
add
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
endearing
than
our
parting
with
our
noble
guest
.
<EOS>
My
lady
repeat
her
command
for
what
she
often
engage
me
to
promise
,
that
be
to
say
,
to
renew
the
correspondence
begin
between
us
,
so
much
(
as
she
be
pleased
to
say
)
to
her
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
shew
her
ladyship
,
who
be
always
enquire
after
my
writing
employment
,
most
of
what
pass
between
you
and
me
:
she
admire
you
much
,
and
wish
Mr.
H.
have
more
wit
,
that
be
her
word
:
she
should
in
that
case
,
she
say
,
be
very
glad
to
set
on
foot
a
treaty
between
you
and
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
,
I
fancy
,
can
never
be
tolerable
to
you
;
and
I
only
mention
it
en
passant
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
french
woman
for
you
!
  
<EOS>
the
countess
be
full
of
her
kind
wish
for
my
happiness
;
and
my
Lady
Davers
tell
me
,
that
if
I
could
give
her
timely
notice
,
she
would
be
present
on
a
certain
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Miss
,
what
could
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
!
 
<EOS>
only
,
I
be
a
sad
coward
,
and
have
a
thousand
anxiety
which
I
can
not
mention
to
any
body
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
have
such
in
the
honourable
estate
of
matrimony
,
what
must
those
poor
soul
have
,
who
be
seduce
,
and
have
all
manner
of
reason
to
apprehend
,
that
the
crime
shall
be
follow
by
a
punishment
so
natural
to
it
?
<EOS>
a
punishment
in
kind
,
as
I
may
say
;
which
if
it
only
end
in
forfeiture
of
life
,
follow
the
forfeiture
of
fame
,
must
be
think
merciful
and
happy
beyond
expectation
:
for
how
shall
they
lay
claim
to
the
hope
give
to
person
in
their
circumstance
that
they
shall
be
save
in
child
-
bearing
,
since
the
condition
be
,
if
they
continue
in
faith
and
charity
,
and
HOLINESS
with
SOBRIETY
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
honoured
mother
,
and
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
since
I
be
upon
this
affect
subject
,
do
not
this
text
seem
to
give
a
comfortable
hope
to
a
good
woman
,
who
shall
thus
die
,
of
be
happy
in
the
divine
mercy
?
<EOS>
for
the
Apostle
,
in
the
context
,
say
,
that
he
suffer
not
a
woman
to
teach
,
nor
usurp
authority
over
the
man
,
but
to
be
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
the
reason
he
give
?
<EOS>
why
,
a
reason
that
be
a
natural
consequence
of
the
curse
on
the
first
disobedience
,
that
she
shall
be
in
subjection
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
Adam
be
not
deceive
;
but
the
woman
,
be
deceive
,
be
in
the
transgression
.
<EOS>
"
as
much
as
to
say
 
have
it
not
be
for
the
woman
,
Adam
have
keep
his
integrity
,
and
therefore
her
punishment
shall
be
,
as
it
be
say
,
"
I
will
greatly
multiply
thy
sorrow
in
thy
conception
:
in
sorrow
shall
thou
bring
forth
child
 
and
thy
husband
shall
rule
over
thee
.
"
<EOS>
but
nevertheless
,
if
thou
shalt
not
survive
the
sharpness
of
thy
sorrow
,
thy
death
shall
be
deem
to
be
such
an
alleviation
of
thy
part
of
the
entail
transgression
,
that
thou
shalt
be
save
,
if
thou
hast
CONTINUED
in
faith
and
charity
,
and
HOLINESS
with
SOBRIETY
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
my
honoured
parent
,
and
my
dear
friend
,
be
my
paraphrase
;
and
I
reap
no
small
comfort
from
it
,
when
I
meditate
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
shall
make
you
as
serious
as
myself
;
and
,
my
dear
friend
,
perhaps
,
frighten
you
from
enter
into
a
state
,
in
which
our
poor
sex
suffer
so
much
,
from
the
bridal
morning
,
let
it
rise
as
gaily
as
it
will
upon
a
thoughtful
mind
,
to
that
affect
circumstance
,
(
throughout
its
whole
progression
)
,
for
which
nothing
but
a
tender
,
a
generous
,
and
a
worthy
husband
can
make
them
any
part
of
amend
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
word
or
two
more
,
as
to
the
parting
with
our
honoured
company
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
indisposed
,
and
they
all
would
excuse
me
,
against
my
will
,
from
attend
them
in
the
coach
some
mile
,
which
their
dear
brother
do
.
<EOS>
both
lady
most
tenderly
salute
me
,
twice
or
thrice
a
-
piece
,
fold
their
kind
arm
about
me
,
and
wish
my
safety
and
health
,
and
charge
me
to
think
little
,
and
hope
much
;
for
they
see
me
thoughtful
at
time
,
though
I
endeavour
to
hide
it
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lord
Davers
say
,
with
a
goodness
of
temper
that
be
peculiar
to
him

"
My

May
God
preserve
you

for
you
more

could

Mr.

buy
a

often
praise
their
prudence

quiet

I
be
force
to
withdraw
a
little
abruptly

lest
I
should

much
move
myself

for
have
our

enquire
into

they
would
perhaps
have
think
it
derogatory
(

I
should
not

too
much
retrospect
to
my

reply
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
may
once
or
twice
drop
some
disrespectful
word
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
effect
of
passion
at
the
time
,
and
with
a
view
to
two
or
three
point
of
his
conduct
in
public
life
;
for
which
I
take
the
liberty
to
find
fault
with
him
,
and
receive
very
unsatisfactory
excuse
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
,
I
remember
,
be
in
a
conference
between
a
committee
of
each
house
of
parliament
,
in
which
he
behave
in
a
way
I
could
not
wish
from
a
man
so
nearly
allied
to
me
by
marriage
;
for
all
he
could
talk
of
,
be
the
dignity
of
their
house
,
when
the
reason
of
the
thing
be
strong
with
the
other
;
and
it
fall
to
my
lot
to
answer
what
he
say
;
which
I
do
with
some
asperity
;
and
this
occasion
a
coolness
between
us
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
no
man
make
a
well
figure
in
private
life
than
Lord
Davers
;
especially
now
that
my
sister
's
good
sense
have
get
the
well
of
her
passion
,
and
she
can
behave
with
tolerable
decency
towards
him
.
<EOS>
for
once
,
Pamela
,
it
be
not
so
:
the
violence
of
her
spirit
make
him
appear
in
a
light
too
little
advantageous
either
to
his
quality
or
merit
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
improve
upon
me
every
time
I
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
not
,
my
dear
,
what
a
disgrace
a
haughty
and
passionate
woman
bring
upon
her
husband
,
and
upon
herself
too
,
in
the
eye
of
her
own
sex
,
as
well
as
ours
.
<EOS>
nay
,
even
those
lady
,
who
would
be
as
glad
of
dominion
as
she
,
if
they
may
be
permit
to
exercise
it
,
despise
other
who
do
,
and
the
man
most
who
suffer
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
let
me
tell
you
,
"
say
the
dear
man
,
with
an
air
that
shew
he
be
satisfied
with
his
own
conduct
in
this
particular
,
"
that
you
can
not
imagine
how
much
a
woman
owe
to
her
husband
,
as
well
with
regard
to
her
own
_
peace
of
mind
,
as
to
_
both
their
reputation
(
however
it
may
go
against
the
grain
with
her
sometimes
)
,
if
he
be
a
man
who
have
discretion
to
keep
her
encroach
passion
under
a
genteel
and
reasonable
control
!
"
  
<EOS>
how
do
you
like
this
doctrine
,
Miss
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
warrant
,
you
believe
,
that
I
could
do
no
less
than
drop
Mr.
B.
one
of
my
good
curt'sie
,
in
acknowledgment
of
my
obligation
to
him
,
for
so
considerately
preserve
to
me
my
peace
of
mind
,
and
my
reputation
,
as
well
as
his
own
,
in
this
case
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
all
,
when
one
duly
weigh
the
matter
,
what
he
say
may
be
right
in
the
main
;
for
I
have
not
be
able
to
contradict
him
,
partial
as
I
be
to
my
sex
,
when
he
have
point
out
to
me
instance
in
the
behaviour
of
certain
lady
,
who
,
like
child
,
the
more
they
have
be
humour
,
the
more
humoursome
they
have
grow
;
which
must
have
occasion
as
great
uneasiness
to
themselves
,
as
to
their
husband
.
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
me
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
this
be
between
ourselves
;
for
I
do
not
own
so
much
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
for
one
should
not
give
up
one
's
sex
,
you
know
,
if
one
can
help
it
:
for
the
man
will
be
as
apt
to
impose
,
as
the
woman
to
encroach
,
I
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
here
,
my
honest
parent
,
and
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
at
last
,
I
end
my
journal
-
wise
letter
,
as
I
may
call
them
;
our
noble
guest
be
go
,
and
our
time
and
employment
roll
on
in
much
the
same
manner
,
as
in
past
day
,
of
which
I
have
give
an
account
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
and
best
beloved
Miss
Darnford
,
your
dutiful
and
affectionate
  
P.B.
    
my
dear
MISS
DARNFORD
,
  
<EOS>
I
hear
that
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
in
no
good
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
pray
for
her
life
,
that
she
may
be
a
credit
(
if
it
please
God
)
to
the
penitence
she
have
so
lately
assume
.
  
<EOS>
do
,
my
dear
good
Miss
,
vouchsafe
to
the
poor
soul
the
honour
of
a
visit
:
she
may
be
low
-
spirited
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
be
too
much
sink
with
the
recollection
of
past
thing
.
<EOS>
Comfort
,
with
that
sweetness
which
be
so
natural
to
Miss
Darnford
,
her
droop
heart
;
and
let
her
know
,
that
I
have
a
true
concern
for
her
,
and
give
it
her
in
charge
to
take
care
of
herself
,
and
spare
nothing
that
will
administer
either
to
her
health
or
peace
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
pardon
me
that
I
put
you
upon
an
office
so
unsuitable
from
a
lady
in
your
station
,
to
a
person
in
hers
;
but
not
to
your
piety
and
charity
,
where
a
duty
so
eminent
as
that
of
visit
the
sick
,
and
cheer
the
doubt
mind
,
be
in
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
your
condescension
will
give
her
great
comfort
;
and
if
she
should
be
hasten
to
her
account
,
what
a
pleasure
will
it
give
such
a
lady
as
you
,
to
have
illuminate
a
benighted
mind
,
when
it
be
totter
on
the
verge
of
death
!
  
<EOS>
I
know
she
will
want
no
spiritual
help
from
good
Mr.
Peters
;
but
then
the
kind
notice
of
so
generally
esteem
a
young
lady
,
will
raise
her
more
than
can
be
imagine
:
for
there
be
a
tenderness
,
a
sympathy
,
in
the
good
person
of
our
sex
to
one
another
,
that
(
while
the
good
of
the
other
seem
but
to
act
as
in
office
,
say
those
thing
,
which
,
though
edify
and
convincing
,
one
be
not
certain
proceed
not
rather
from
the
fortitude
of
their
mind
,
than
the
tenderness
of
their
nature
)
<EOS>
mingle
with
one
's
very
spirit
,
thin
the
animal
mass
,
and
run
through
one
's
heart
in
the
same
lify
current
<EOS>
(
I
can
not
clothe
my
thought
suitably
to
express
what
I
would
)
,
give
assurance
,
as
well
as
pleasure
,
in
the
most
arduous
case
,
and
brighten
our
misty
prospect
,
till
we
see
the
Sun
of
Righteousness
rise
on
the
hill
of
comfort
,
and
dispel
the
heavy
fog
of
doubt
and
diffidence
.
  
<EOS>
this
it
be
make
me
wish
and
long
as
I
do
,
for
the
company
of
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
.
<EOS>
o
when
shall
I
see
you
?
<EOS>
when
shall
I
?
 
<EOS>
to
speak
to
my
present
case
,
it
be
all
I
long
for
;
and
,
pardon
my
freedom
of
expression
,
as
well
as
thought
,
<EOS>
when
I
let
you
know
in
this
instance
,
how
early
I
experience
the
ardent
longing
of
one
in
the
way
I
be
in
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
ought
not
to
set
my
heart
upon
any
thing
not
in
my
own
power
,
and
which
may
be
subject
to
accident
,
and
the
control
of
other
.
<EOS>
but
let
whatever
intervention
happen
,
so
I
have
your
will
to
come
,
I
must
be
rejoice
in
your
kind
intention
,
although
your
power
should
not
prove
answerable
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
say
no
more
,
than
that
I
be
,
my
honoured
father
and
mother
,
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
;
<EOS>
and
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
your
affectionate
and
oblige
P.B.
    
from
Miss
Darnford
to
Mrs.
B.
  
my
dear
MRS

<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
We
be
greatly
oblige
to
you
for
every
particular
article
in
your
entertaining
journal
,
which
you
have
bring
,
sooner
than
we
wish
,
to
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
express
how
much
we
admire
you
for
your
judicious
charity
,
so
easy
to
be
practise
,
yet
so
uncommon
in
the
manner
,
and
for
your
inimitable
conduct
in
the
affair
of
your
frail
Polly
and
the
silly
Mr.
H.
  
<EOS>
Your
account
of
the
visit
of
the
four
rake
;
of
your
parting
with
your
noble
guest
;
Mr.
H.
's
letter
(
an
original
indeed
!
)
have
all
greatly
entertain
us
,
as
your
prerogative
hint
have
amuse
us
:
but
we
defer
our
opinion
of
those
hint
,
till
we
have
the
case
more
fully
explain
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
friend
,
be
you
not
in
danger
of
fall
into
a
too
thoughtful
and
gloomy
way
?
<EOS>
by
the
latter
part
of
your
last
letter
,
we
be
afraid
you
be
;
and
my
mamma
,
and
Mrs.
Jones
,
and
Mrs.
Peters
,
enjoin
me
to
write
,
to
caution
you
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
less
need
of
it
,
because
your
prudence
will
always
suggest
to
you
reason
,
as
it
do
in
that
very
letter
,
that
must
out
-
balance
your
fear
.
<EOS>
think
little
,
and
hope
much
,
be
a
good
lesson
in
your
case
,
and
to
a
lady
of
your
temper
;
and
I
hope
Lady
Davers
will
not
in
vain
have
give
you
that
caution
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
dare
say
your
thoughtfulness
be
but
symptomatical
,
and
will
go
off
in
proper
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
wave
this
:
let
me
ask
you
,
be
Mr.
B.
's
conduct
to
you
as
respectful
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
mean
fond
,
when
you
be
alone
together
,
as
in
company
?
 
<EOS>
forgive
me
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
hint
two
or
three
time
,
in
your
letter
,
that
he
always
be
most
complaisant
to
you
in
company
;
and
you
observe
,
that
wisely
do
he
act
in
this
,
as
he
thereby
do
credit
with
every
body
to
his
own
choice
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
,
that
the
many
charming
scene
which
your
genius
and
fine
behaviour
furnish
out
to
him
,
must
,
as
often
as
they
happen
,
inspire
him
with
joy
,
and
even
rapture
:
and
must
make
him
love
you
more
for
your
mind
than
for
your
person
:
 
but
these
rapturous
scene
last
very
little
long
than
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
what
I
want
to
know
be
,
whether
in
the
steady
part
of
life
,
when
you
be
both
nearer
the
level
of
us
common
folk
,
he
give
up
any
thing
of
his
own
will
in
compliment
to
yours
?
<EOS>
whether
he
act
the
part
of
a
respectful
,
polite
gentleman
,
in
his
behaviour
to
you
;
and
break
not
into
your
retirement
,
in
the
dress
,
and
with
the
brutal
roughness
of
a
fox
-
hunter
?
 
<EOS>
make
no
difference
,
perhaps
,
between
the
field
or
his
stud
(
I
will
not
say
kennel
)
and
your
chamber
or
closet
?
 
<EOS>
policy
,
for
his
own
credit
-
sake
,
as
I
mention
,
account
to
me
well
,
for
his
complaisance
to
you
in
public
.
<EOS>
but
his
regular
and
uniform
behaviour
to
you
,
in
your
retirement
,
when
the
conversation
between
you
turn
upon
usual
and
common
subject
,
and
you
have
not
oblige
him
to
rise
to
admiration
of
you
,
by
such
scene
as
those
of
your
two
parson
,
Sir
Jacob
Swynford
,
and
the
like
:
be
what
would
satisfy
my
curiosity
,
if
you
please
to
give
me
an
instance
or
two
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
if
you
can
give
me
a
case
,
partly
or
nearly
thus
circumstance
,
you
will
highly
oblige
me
:
  
<EOS>
first
,
where
he
have
bear
with
any
infirmity
of
your
own
;
and
I
know
of
none
where
you
can
give
him
such
an
opportunity
,
except
you
get
into
a
vapourish
habit
,
by
give
way
to
a
temper
too
thoughtful
and
apprehensive
:
  
<EOS>
next
,
that
,
in
complaisance
to
your
will
,
he
recede
from
his
own
in
any
one
instance
:
  
next
,
whether
he
break
not
into
your
retirement
unceremoniously
,
and
without
apology
or
concern
,
as
I
hint
above
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
all
I
mean
,
by
what
I
have
say
.
<EOS>
;
and
if
you
have
any
pretty
conversation
in
memory
,
by
the
recital
of
which
,
this
my
bold
curiosity
may
be
answer
,
pray
oblige
me
with
it
;
and
we
shall
be
able
to
judge
by
it
,
not
only
of
the
in
-
bear
generosity
which
all
that
know
Mr.
B.
have
be
willing
to
attribute
to
him
,
but
of
the
likelihood
of
the
continuance
of
both
your
felicity
,
upon
term
suitable
to
the
character
of
a
fine
lady
and
fine
gentleman
:
and
,
of
consequence
,
worthy
of
the
imitation
of
the
most
delicate
of
our
own
sex
.
  
<EOS>
Your
obliging
longing
,
my
beloved
dear
lady
,
for
my
company
,
I
hope
,
will
very
soon
be
answer
.
<EOS>
My
papa
be
so
pleased
with
your
sweet
earnestness
on
this
occasion
,
that
he
join
with
my
mamma
;
and
both
,
with
equal
cheerfulness
,
say
,
you
should
not
be
many
day
in
London
before
me
.
<EOS>
Murray
and
his
mistress
go
on
swimmingly
,
and
have
not
yet
have
one
quarrel
.
<EOS>
the
only
person
,
he
,
of
either
sex
,
that
ever
know
Nancy
so
intimately
,
and
so
long
,
without
one
!
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
I
have
to
say
,
at
present
,
when
I
have
assure
you
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
how
much
I
be
your
oblige
,
and
affectionate
POLLY
DARNFORD
.
    
<EOS>
My
dearest
Miss
Darnford
,
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
end
my
last
letter
in
a
gloomy
way
;
and
I
be
oblige
to
you
for
the
kind
and
friendly
notice
you
take
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
owe
to
a
train
of
thinking
which
sometimes
I
get
into
,
of
late
;
I
hope
only
symptomatically
,
as
you
say
,
and
that
the
cause
and
effect
will
soon
vanish
together
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
a
task
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
will
warrant
,
you
think
you
have
set
me
!
<EOS>
I
think
,
in
the
progress
of
my
journal
,
and
in
my
letter
,
I
have
give
so
many
instance
of
Mr.
B.
's
polite
tenderness
to
me
,
that
no
new
one
would
be
require
at
my
hand
;
and
when
I
say
he
be
always
most
complaisant
before
company
,
I
little
expect
,
that
such
an
inference
would
be
draw
from
my
word
,
as
would
tend
to
question
the
uniformity
of
his
behaviour
to
me
,
when
there
be
no
witness
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
clear
up
all
your
doubt
on
this
subject
.
  
<EOS>
to
begin
then
:
  
<EOS>
You
first
desire
an
instance
,
where
Mr.
B.
have
bear
with
some
infirmity
of
mine
:
  
<EOS>
next
,
that
in
complaisance
to
my
will
,
he
have
recede
from
his
own
:
  
<EOS>
and
lastly
,
whether
he
break
not
into
my
retirement
unceremoniously
;
and
without
apology
or
concern
,
make
no
difference
between
the
field
or
the
stud
,
and
my
chamber
or
closet
?
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
first
,
his
bearing
with
my
infirmity
;
he
be
daily
give
instance
of
his
goodness
to
me
on
this
head
;
and
I
be
ashamed
to
say
,
that
of
late
I
give
him
so
much
occasion
for
them
as
I
do
;
but
he
see
my
apprehensiveness
,
at
time
,
though
I
endeavour
to
conceal
it
;
and
no
husband
be
ever
so
soothing
and
so
indulgent
as
Mr.
B.
He
give
me
the
good
advice
,
<EOS>
as
to
my
malady
,
if
I
may
call
it
one
:
treat
me
with
redouble
tenderness
:
<EOS>
talk
to
me
upon
the
subject
I
most
delight
to
dwell
upon
:
as
of
my
worthy
parent
;
what
they
be
do
at
this
time
,
and
at
that
;
of
our
intend
journey
to
London
;
of
the
diversion
of
the
town
;
of
Miss
Darnford
's
company
;
and
when
he
go
abroad
,
send
up
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
to
me
,
because
I
should
not
be
alone
:
at
other
time
,
take
me
abroad
with
him
,
bring
this
neighbour
and
that
neighbour
to
visit
;
and
carry
me
to
visit
them
;
talk
of
our
journey
to
Kent
,
and
into
Lincolnshire
,
and
to
my
Lady
Davers
's
,
to
Bath
,
to
Tunbridge
,
and
I
can
not
tell
whither
,
when
the
apprehend
time
shall
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
in
fine
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
you
can
not
imagine
one
half
of
his
tender
goodness
and
politeness
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
then
he
hardly
ever
go
to
any
distance
,
but
bring
some
pretty
present
<EOS>
he
think
will
be
grateful
to
me
.
<EOS>
when
at
home
,
he
be
seldom
out
of
my
company
;
delight
to
teach
me
french
and
italian
,
and
read
me
piece
of
manuscript
poetry
,
in
several
of
the
modern
tongue
(
for
he
speak
them
all
)
;
explain
to
me
every
thing
I
understand
not
;
delight
to
answer
all
my
question
,
and
to
encourage
my
inquisitiveness
and
curiosity
,
try
to
give
me
a
notion
of
picture
and
medal
,
and
read
me
lecture
upon
them
,
for
he
have
a
fine
collection
of
both
;
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
will
have
it
,
that
he
have
be
improve
by
my
question
and
observation
.
  
<EOS>
what
say
you
to
these
thing
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
do
they
come
up
to
your
first
question
?
<EOS>
or
do
they
not
?
<EOS>
or
be
not
what
I
have
say
,
a
full
answer
,
be
I
to
say
no
more
,
to
all
your
enquiry
?
  
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
be
thoroughly
convinced
,
that
half
the
misunderstanding
,
among
married
people
,
be
owe
to
trifle
,
to
petty
distinction
,
to
mere
word
,
and
little
captious
folly
,
to
over
-
weening
,
or
unguarded
petulance
:
and
who
would
forego
the
solid
satisfaction
of
life
,
for
the
sake
of
triumph
in
such
poor
contention
,
if
one
could
triumph
?
  
<EOS>
but
you
next
require
of
me
an
instance
,
where
,
in
complaisance
to
my
will
,
he
have
recede
from
his
own
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
this
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
B.
be
all
tenderness
and
indulgence
,
and
require
of
me
nothing
,
that
I
can
have
a
material
objection
to
,
ought
I
not
to
oblige
him
?
<EOS>
Can
I
have
a
will
that
be
not
his
?
<EOS>
or
would
it
be
excusable
if
I
have
?
<EOS>
all
little
matter
I
cheerfully
give
up
:
great
one
have
not
yet
occur
between
us
,
and
I
hope
never
will
.
<EOS>
one
point
,
indeed
,
I
have
some
apprehension
may
happen
;
and
that
,
to
be
plain
with
you
,
be
,
we
have
have
a
debate
or
two
on
the
subject
(
which
I
maintain
)
of
a
mother
's
duty
to
nurse
her
own
child
;
and
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
,
he
seem
more
determined
than
I
wish
he
be
,
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
not
proceed
so
far
as
to
awaken
the
sleep
dragon
I
mention
.
<EOS>
prerogative
by
name
;
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
I
can
not
give
up
this
point
very
contentedly
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
less
point
,
have
I
be
a
duchess
bear
,
I
think
I
would
not
have
contest
them
with
my
husband
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
give
you
many
respectful
instance
too
,
of
his
receding
,
when
he
have
desire
to
see
what
I
have
be
write
,
and
I
have
tell
him
to
whom
,
and
beg
to
be
excuse
.
<EOS>
one
such
instance
I
can
give
since
I
begin
this
letter
.
<EOS>
this
be
it
:
  
<EOS>
I
put
it
in
my
bosom
,
when
he
come
up
:
he
see
me
do
so
:
  
"
be
you
write
,
my
dear
,
what
I
must
not
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
write
to
Miss
Darnford
,
Sir
:
and
she
beg
you
may
not
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
augment
my
curiosity
,
Pamela
.
<EOS>
what
can
two
such
lady
write
,
that
I
may
not
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
not
be
displeased
,
Sir
,
I
have
rather
you
would
not
,
because
she
desire
you
may
not
see
her
letter
,
nor
this
my
answer
,
till
the
letter
be
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
not
,
"
return
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
  
Will
this
instance
,
my
dear
,
come
up
to
your
demand
for
one
,
where
he
recede
from
his
own
will
,
in
complaisance
to
mine
?
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
as
to
what
both
our
notion
and
our
practice
be
on
the
article
of
my
retirement
,
and
whether
he
break
in
upon
them
unceremoniously
,
and
without
apology
,
let
the
conversation
I
promise
inform
you
,
which
begin
on
the
follow
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
ride
out
early
one
morning
,
within
a
few
day
past
,
and
do
not
return
till
the
afternoon
;
an
absence
I
have
not
be
use
to
of
late
;
and
breakfasting
and
dining
without
him
be
also
a
new
thing
with
me
<EOS>
,
I
have
such
an
impatience
to
see
him
,
have
expect
him
at
dinner
,
that
I
be
force
to
retire
to
my
closet
,
to
try
to
divert
it
,
by
write
;
and
the
gloomy
conclusion
of
my
last
be
then
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
return
about
four
o'clock
,
and
indeed
do
not
tarry
to
change
his
riding
-
dress
,
as
your
politeness
,
my
dear
friend
,
would
perhaps
have
expect
;
but
come
directly
up
to
me
,
with
an
impatience
to
see
me
,
equal
to
my
own
,
when
he
be
tell
,
upon
enquiry
,
that
I
be
in
my
closet
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
his
welcome
step
,
as
he
come
up
stair
;
which
generally
,
after
a
long
absence
than
I
expect
,
have
such
an
effect
upon
my
fond
heart
,
that
it
give
a
responsive
throb
for
every
step
he
take
towards
me
,
and
beat
quicker
and
faster
,
as
he
come
nearer
.
  
<EOS>
I
meet
him
at
my
closet
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
my
dear
love
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
fold
his
kind
arm
about
me
,
and
salute
me
with
ardour
.
<EOS>
"
whenever
I
have
be
but
a
few
hour
from
you
,
my
impatience
to
see
my
beloved
,
will
not
permit
me
to
stand
upon
the
formality
of
a
message
to
know
how
you
be
engage
;
but
I
break
in
upon
you
,
even
in
my
riding
-
dress
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dear
Sir
,
you
be
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
notion
of
mere
formality
of
this
kind
"
 
<EOS>
(
how
unpolite
this
,
my
dear
,
in
your
friend
?
)
 
<EOS>
"
in
a
married
state
,
since
'
tis
impossible
a
virtuous
wife
can
be
employ
about
any
thing
that
her
husband
may
not
know
,
and
so
need
not
fear
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
you
say
this
,
my
Pamela
;
for
I
have
always
think
the
extraordinary
civility
and
distance
of
this
kind
which
I
have
observe
among
several
person
of
rank
,
altogether
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
for
if
they
be
exact
by
the
lady
,
I
should
suspect
she
have
reserve
,
which
she
herself
believe
I
could
not
approve
.
<EOS>
if
not
exact
,
but
practise
of
choice
by
the
gentleman
,
it
carry
with
it
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
false
air
of
politeness
,
little
less
than
affrontive
to
the
lady
,
and
dishonourable
to
himself
;
for
do
it
not
look
as
if
he
suppose
,
and
allow
,
that
she
may
be
so
employed
that
it
be
necessary
to
apprise
her
of
his
visit
,
lest
he
should
make
discovery
not
to
her
credit
or
his
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
would
not
,
Sir
"
<EOS>
(
for
I
think
his
conclusion
too
severe
)
,
"
make
such
a
harsh
supposition
as
this
neither
:
for
there
be
little
delicacy
and
moment
of
retirement
,
no
doubt
,
in
which
a
modest
lady
would
wish
to
be
indulge
by
the
tender
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
in
an
early
matrimony
,
before
the
lady
's
confidence
in
the
honour
and
discretion
of
the
man
she
have
choose
have
disengage
her
from
her
bridal
reserve

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bridal
reserve
,
dear
Sir
!
<EOS>
permit
me
to
give
it
as
my
humble
opinion
,
that
a
wife
's
behaviour
ought
to
be
as
pure
and
circumspect
,
in
degree
,
as
that
of
a
bride
,
or
even
of
a
maiden
lady
,
be
her
confidence
in
her
husband
's
honour
and
discretion
ever
so
great
.
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
I
think
a
gross
or
a
careless
demeanour
<EOS>
little
become
that
modesty
which
be
the
peculiar
excellency
and
distinction
of
our
sex
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
account
very
well
,
my
dear
,
by
what
you
now
say
for
your
own
over
-
nice
behaviour
,
as
I
have
sometimes
think
it
.
<EOS>
but
be
we
not
all
apt
to
argue
for
a
practice
we
make
our
own
,
because
we
do
make
it
our
own
,
rather
than
from
the
reason
of
the
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Sir
,
that
be
not
the
present
case
with
me
;
for
,
permit
me
to
say
,
that
an
over
-
free
or
negligent
behaviour
of
a
lady
in
the
married
state
,
must
be
a
mark
of
disrespect
to
her
consort
,
and
would
shew
as
if
she
be
very
little
solicitous
about
what
appearance
she
make
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
and
must
not
this
beget
in
him
a
slight
opinion
of
her
sex
too
,
as
if
,
suppose
the
gentleman
have
be
a
free
liver
,
she
would
convince
him
there
be
no
other
difference
in
the
sex
,
but
as
they
be
within
or
without
the
pale
,
license
by
the
law
,
or
act
in
defiance
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
the
force
of
your
argument

Pamela

to
say
something
more

"
  
<EOS>

only
,
Sir

permit
me
to
add
,
that
when

in

you
enjoin
me
to
appear
before
you
always
dress
,
even
in

early

it

be
wrong

I
be
a
little
too
thoughtful
,
from
my
subject
,
before
you
come
;
but
your
presence
,
like
the
sun
,
have
dissipate
the
mist
that
hang
upon
my
mind
.
<EOS>
see
you
not
,
"
and
I
press
his
hand
with
my
lip
,
"
they
be
all
go
already
?
"
<EOS>
smile
upon
him
with
a
delight
unfeigned
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
,
my
dear
Pamela
;
and
therefore
,
if
you
have
no
objection
,
I
will
change
my
dress
,
and
attend
you
in
the
chariot
for
an
hour
or
two
,
whither
you
please
,
that
not
one
shadow
may
remain
visible
in
this
dear
face
;
"
tenderly
salute
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
whithersoever
you
please
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
a
little
airing
with
you
will
be
highly
agreeable
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
dear
obliger
go
and
change
his
dress
in
an
instant
;
and
he
lead
me
to
the
chariot
,
with
his
usual
tender
politeness
,
and
we
have
a
charming
airing
of
several
mile
;
return
quite
happy
,
cheerful
,
and
delight
with
each
other
's
conversation
,
without
call
in
upon
any
of
our
good
neighbour
:
for
what
need
of
that
,
my
dear
,
when
we
could
be
the
good
company
in
the
world
to
each
other
?
  
<EOS>
do
these
instance
come
up
to
your
question
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
or
,
do
they
not
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
think
not
,
I
could
give
you
our
conversation
in
the
chariot
:
for
I
write
it
down
at
my
first
leisure
,
so
highly
be
I
delighted
with
it
;
for
the
subject
be
my
dear
parent
;
a
subject
start
by
himself
,
because
he
know
it
would
oblige
me
.
<EOS>
but
be
tired
with
writing
,
I
may
reserve
it
,
till
I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
,
if
you
think
it
worth
ask
for
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
will
hasten
to
a
conclusion
of
this
long
letter
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
farth
to
add
,
for
my
comfort
,
that
next
Thursday
se'n
-
night
,
if
nothing
hinder
,
we
be
to
set
out
for
London
.
<EOS>
and
why
do
you
think
I
say
for
my
comfort
?
<EOS>
only
that
I
shall
then
soon
have
the
opportunity
,
to
assure
you
personally
,
as
you
give
me
hope
,
how
much
I
be
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
your
truly
affectionate
.
<EOS>
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
  
one
more
letter
,
and
I
have
do
for
a
great
while
,
because
I
hope
your
presence
will
put
an
end
to
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
tell
you
of
my
second
visit
to
the
dairy
-
house
,
where
we
go
to
breakfast
,
in
the
chariot
and
four
,
because
of
the
distance
,
which
be
ten
pretty
long
mile
.
  
<EOS>
I
transcribe
for
you
,
from
letter
write
formerly
to
my
dear
parent
,
an
account
of
my
former
dairy
-
house
visit
,
and
what
the
people
be
,
and
whom
I
see
there
;
and
although
I
besought
you
to
keep
that
affair
to
yourself
,
as
too
much
affect
the
reputation
of
my
Mr.
B.
to
be
know
any
farther
,
and
even
to
destroy
that
account
,
when
you
have
peruse
it
;
yet
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
you
remember
the
story
,
and
so
I
need
not
repeat
any
part
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
there
,
we
find
at
the
door
,
expect
us
(
for
they
hear
the
chariot
-
wheel
at
a
distance
)
,
my
pretty
Miss
Goodwin
,
and
two
other
Misses
,
who
have
earn
their
ride
,
attend
by
the
governess
's
daughter
,
a
discreet
young
gentlewoman
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
step
out
,
the
child
run
into
my
arm
with
great
eagerness
,
and
I
as
tenderly
embrace
her
,
and
lead
her
into
the
parlour
,
ask
her
abundance
of
question
about
her
work
,
and
her
lesson
;
and
among
the
rest
if
she
have
merit
this
distinction
of
the
chaise
and
dairy
-
house
breakfast
,
or
if
it
be
owe
to
her
uncle
's
favour
,
and
to
that
of
her
governess
?
<EOS>
the
young
gentlewoman
assure
me
it
be
to
both
,
and
shew
me
her
needlework
,
and
penmanship
;
and
the
child
be
highly
pleased
with
my
commendation
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
good
deal
of
notice
of
the
other
two
Misses
,
for
their
school
-
fellow
's
sake
,
and
make
each
of
them
a
present
of
some
little
toy
;
and
my
Miss
,
of
a
number
of
pretty
trinket
,
with
which
she
be
highly
delighted
;
and
I
tell
her
,
that
I
would
wait
upon
her
governess
,
when
I
come
from
London
into
the
country
again
,
and
see
in
what
order
she
keep
her
little
matter
;
for
,
above
all
thing
,
I
love
pretty
house
-
wifely
miss
;
and
then
,
I
would
bring
her
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
observe
,
with
no
small
satisfaction
,
the
child
's
behaviour
,
which
be
very
pretty
;
and
appear
as
fond
of
her
,
as
if
he
have
be
more
than
her
uncle
,
and
yet
seem
under
some
restraint
,
lest
it
should
be
take
,
that
he
be
more
.
<EOS>
such
power
have
secret
guilt
,
poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
to
lessen
and
restrain
a
pleasure
,
that
would
,
in
a
happy
light
,
have
be
so
laudable
to
have
manifest
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
let
you
into
a
charming
scene
,
result
from
this
perplexity
of
the
dear
gentleman
.
<EOS>
a
scene
that
have
afford
me
high
delight
ever
since
;
and
always
will
,
when
I
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
be
very
fond
of
her
uncle
,
and
tell
him
she
love
him
dearly
,
and
always
would
love
and
honour
him
,
for
give
her
such
a
good
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
You
talk
,
Madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
when
I
see
you
before
,
that
I
should
come
and
live
with
you
 
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
indeed
I
will
be
very
good
,
and
do
every
thing
you
bid
me
,
and
mind
my
book
,
and
my
needle
;
indeed
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ask
your
uncle
,
my
dear

"
say
I
;
"
I
should
like
your
pretty
company
of
all

.
"
  
<EOS>
She
go
to
Mr.
B.
and
say
,
"
Shall

,
Sir
,
go
and
live
with
my
aunt
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
,
when
you
come
from
London
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
very
good
governess
,
child
,
"
say
he
;
"
and
she
can
not
part
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
she
can
.
<EOS>
Sir
;
she
have
a
great
many
Misses
,
and
can
spare
me
well
enough
;
and
if
you
please
to
let
me
ride
in
your
coach
sometimes
,
I
can
go
and
visit
my
governess
,
and
beg
a
holiday
for
the
Misses
,
now
-
and
-
then
,
when
I
be
almost
a
woman
,
and
then
all
the
Misses
will
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
the
Misses
love
you
now
,
Miss
Goodwin
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
love
me
well
enough
,
for
matter
of
that
;
but
they
will
love
me
better
,
when
I
can
beg
them
a
holiday
.
<EOS>
do
,
dear
Sir
,
let
me
go
home
to
my
new
aunt
,
next
time
you
come
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
with
the
dear
child
's
earnestness
;
and
permit
her
to
have
her
full
argument
with
her
beloved
uncle
;
but
be
much
moved
,
and
he
himself
be
under
some
concern
,
when
she
say
,
"
but
you
should
,
in
pity
,
let
me
live
with
you
,
Sir
,
for
I
have
no
papa
,
nor
mamma
<EOS>
neither
:
they
be
so
far
off
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
love
you
both
as
if
you
be
my
own
papa
and
mamma
;
so
,
dear
now
,
<EOS>
my
good
uncle
,
promise
the
poor
girl
that
have
never
a
papa
nor
mamma
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
withdraw
to
the
door
:
"
It
will
rain
,
I
believe
,
"
say
I
,
and
look
up
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
have
almost
a
shower
in
my
eye
:
and
have
I
keep
my
place
,
could
not
have
refrain
shew
how
much
I
be
affect
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
as
I
say
,
be
a
little
moved
;
but
for
fear
the
young
gentlewoman
should
take
notice
of
it
 
"
<EOS>
how
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
no
papa
and
mamma
!
 
<EOS>
do
they
not
send
you
a
pretty
black
boy
to
wait
upon
you
,
a
while
ago
?
<EOS>
have
you
forget
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
reply
she
:
"
<EOS>
but
what
be
a
black
boy
to
live
with
my
new
aunt
?
 
<EOS>
that
be
well
a
great
deal
than
a
black
boy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
your
aunt
and
I
will
consider
of
it
,
when
we
come
from
London
.
<EOS>
be
a
good
girl
,
meantime
,
and
do
as
your
governess
would
have
you
,
and
then
you
do
not
know
what
we
may
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
then
,
Miss
,
"
say
she
to
her
young
governess
,
"
let
me
be
set
two
task
instead
of
one
,
and
I
will
learn
all
I
can
to
deserve
to
go
to
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
the
little
prattler
divert
herself
.
<EOS>
and
as
we
return
from
them
,
the
scene
I
hint
at
,
open
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
be
pleased
to
say
,
"
what
a
poor
figure
do
the
proud
man
make
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Pamela
,
under
the
sense
of
a
conceal
guilt
,
in
company
of
the
innocent
who
know
it
,
and
even
of
those
who
do
not
!
 
<EOS>
since
the
casual
expression
of
a
baby
shall
overwhelm
him
with
shame
,
and
make
him
unable
to
look
up
without
confusion
.
<EOS>
I
blush
for
myself
,
"
continue
he
,
"
to
see
how
you
be
affect
for
me
,
and
yet
withdraw
,
to
avoid
reproach
me
so
much
as
with
a
look
.
<EOS>
surely
,
Pamela
,
I
must
then
make
a
most
contemptible
appearance
in
your
eye
!
<EOS>
do
you
not
disdain
me
at
that
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Sir
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
speak
such
a
word
?
<EOS>
a
word
I
can
not
repeat
after
you
!
<EOS>
for
at
that
very
time
,
I
beheld
you
with
the
more
reverence
,
for
see
your
noble
heart
touch
with
a
sense
of
your
error
;
and
it
be
such
an
earnest
to
me
of
the
happy
change
I
could
ever
wish
for
,
and
in
so
young
a
gentleman
,
that
it
be
one
half
joy
for
that
,
and
the
other
half
concern
at
the
little
charmer
's
accidental
plea
,
to
her
good
and
near
friend
,
for
come
home
to
her
new
aunt
,
that
affect
me
so
sensibly
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
talk
to
me
of
the
child
's
come
home
,
after
this
visit
,
Pamela
;
for
how
,
at
this
rate
,
shall
I
stand
the
reproach
of
my
own
mind
,
when
I
see
the
little
prater
every
day
before
me
,
and
think
of
what
her
poor
mamma
have
suffer
on
my
account
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
enough
,
that
in
you
,
my
dear
,
I
have
an
hourly
reproach
before
me
,
for
my
attempt
on
your
virtue
;
and
I
have
nothing
to
boast
of
,
but
that
I
give
way
to
the
triumph
of
your
innocence
:
and
what
then
be
my
boast
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
boast

dearest
Sir

<EOS>
You

everything

You

its
past
mistake

you

You

will
endeavour
to
confirm
to
you
all
the
hope
which
the
present
occasion
have
give
you
of
me
,
and
which
I
see
by
these
transport
effect
be
so
desirable
to
you
.

<EOS>
the
chariot
bring
us
home
sooner
than
I
wish
,
and
Mr.
B.
hand
me
into
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
"
say
he

meet
her
in
the
passage
,
"
receive
your
angelic
lady
.
<EOS>
I
must
take
a
little
tour
without
you
,
Pamela
;
for
I
have
have
too
much
of
your
dear
company
,
and
must
leave
you
,
to
descend
again
into
myself
;
for
you
have
raise
me
to
such
a
height
,
that
it
be
with
pain
<EOS>
I
look
down
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
kiss
my
hand
,
and
go
into
his
chariot
again
;
for
it
be
but
half
an
hour
after
twelve
;
and
say
he
would
be
back
by
two
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
leave
Mrs.
Jervis
wonder
at
his
word
,
and
at
the
solemn
air
with
which
he
utter
them
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
tell
that
good
friend
the
occasion
,
I
have
a
new
joy
in
the
pleasure
and
gratulation
of
the
dear
good
woman
,
on
what
have
pass
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
letter
will
be
from
London
,
and
to
you
,
my
honoured
parent
;
for
to
you
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
not
write
again
,
expect
to
see
you
soon
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
now
write
seldomer
,
because
I
be
to
renew
my
correspondence
with
Lady
Davers
;
with
whom
I
can
not
be
so
free
,
as
I
have
be
with
Miss
Darnford
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
doubt
,
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
you
can
not
have
the
particular
of
that
correspondence
;
for
I
shall
never
find
time
to
transcribe
.
  
<EOS>
but
every
opportunity
that
offer
,
you
may
assure
yourself
,
shall
be
lay
hold
of
by
your
ever
-
dutiful
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
as
I
inscribe
this
letter
to
you
,
let
me
conclude
it
,
with
the
assurance
,
that
I
be
,
and
ever
will
be
your
most
affectionate
friend
and
servant
,
P.B.
    
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
we
arrive
safely
in
town
last
night
.
<EOS>
We
find
a
stately
,
well
-
furnish
,
and
convenient
house
;
and
I
have
my
closet
,
or
library
,
and
my
withdrawing
room
,
all
in
complete
order
,
which
Mr.
B.
give
me
possession
of
in
the
most
obliging
manner
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
new
world
,
as
I
may
say
,
and
see
such
vast
pile
of
building
,
and
such
a
concourse
of
people
,
and
hear
such
a
rattling
of
coach
in
the
day
,
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
make
of
it
,
as
yet
.
<EOS>
then
the
nightly
watch
,
go
their
hourly
round
,
disturb
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
soon
be
use
to
that
,
and
sleep
the
sounder
,
perhaps
,
for
the
security
it
assure
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
be
impatient
to
shew
me
what
be
curious
in
and
about
this
vast
city
,
and
to
hear
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
say
,
my
observation
upon
what
I
shall
see
.
<EOS>
He
have
carry
me
through
several
of
the
fine
street
this
day
in
his
chariot
;
but
,
at
present
,
I
have
too
confuse
a
notion
of
thing
,
to
give
any
account
of
them
:
nor
shall
I
trouble
you
with
description
of
that
kind
;
for
you
be
within
a
day
's
journey
of
London
,
I
hope
for
the
pleasure
of
see
you
oftener
than
I
could
expect
before
;
and
shall
therefore
leave
these
matter
to
your
own
observation
,
and
what
you
will
hear
from
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
impatient
for
the
arrival
of
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
,
whose
company
and
conversation
will
reconcile
me
,
in
a
great
measure
,
to
this
new
world
.
  
<EOS>
Our
family
at
present
be
Colbrand
,
Jonathan
,
and
six
man
servant
,
include
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
the
four
maid
be
also
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
good
Mrs.
Jervis
be
indispose
;
so
come
not
up
with
us
;
but
we
expect
her
and
Mr.
Longman
in
a
day
or
two
:
for
Mr.
B.
have
give
her
to
my
wish
;
and
as
Mr.
Longman
's
business
will
require
him
to
be
up
and
down
frequently
,
Mrs.
Jervis
's
care
will
be
the
better
dispense
with
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
see
the
dear
good
woman
,
and
shall
be
more
in
my
element
when
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
have
,
besides
,
<EOS>
my
penitent
Polly
Barlow
,
who
have
never
hold
up
her
head
since
that
deplorable
instance
of
her
weakness
,
which
I
mention
to
you
and
to
Miss
Darnford
,
yet
be
I
as
kind
to
her
as
if
nothing
bad
happen
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
however
,
some
good
husband
would
offer
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
,
our
worthy
chaplain
,
be
now
with
Mr.
Williams
.
<EOS>
He
purpose
to
give
us
his
company
here
till
Christmas
,
when
probably
matter
will
be
adjust
for
him
to
take
possession
of
his
living
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
not
to
let
fall
a
good
custom
,
when
perhaps
we
have
most
occasion
for
it
,
I
make
Jonathan
,
who
be
reverend
by
his
year
and
silver
hair
,
supply
his
place
,
appoint
him
the
prayer
he
be
to
read
.
  
<EOS>
God
preserve
you
both
in
health
,
and
continue
to
me
,
I
beseech
you
,
your
prayer
and
blessing
,
conclude
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
,
P.
B.
    
<EOS>
from
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
My
Dearest
Lady
,
  
<EOS>
I
must
beg
pardon
,
for
have
be
in
this
great
town
more
than
a
week
,
and
not
have
find
an
opportunity
to
tender
my
devoir
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
dear
Madam
,
what
hurry
and
fatigue
must
attend
such
a
journey
,
to
one
in
my
way
,
and
to
an
entire
new
settlement
in
which
an
hundred
thing
must
be
do
,
and
attend
to
,
with
a
preference
to
other
occasion
,
however
delightful
.
<EOS>
yet
,
I
must
own
,
we
find
a
stately
,
well
-
order
,
and
convenient
house
:
<EOS>
but
,
although
it
be
not
far
from
the
field
,
and
have
an
airy
opening
to
its
back
part
,
and
its
front
to
a
square
,
as
it
be
call
,
yet
I
be
not
reconcile
to
it
,
so
entirely
as
to
the
beloved
mansion
we
leave
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B.
have
be
,
and
be
,
busily
employ
in
order
some
few
alteration
,
to
make
thing
still
more
commodious
.
<EOS>
He
have
furnish
me
out
a
pretty
library
;
and
have
allot
me
very
convenient
apartment
besides
:
<EOS>
the
furniture
of
every
place
be
rich
,
as
befit
the
mind
and
fortune
of
the
generous
owner
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
offer
at
particular
,
as
we
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
my
good
lord
,
and
your
ladyship
,
before
the
winter
weather
set
in
,
to
make
the
road
too
dirty
and
deep
:
but
it
be
proper
to
mention
,
that
the
house
be
so
large
,
that
we
can
make
a
great
number
of
bed
,
the
more
conveniently
to
receive
the
honour
of
your
ladyship
,
and
my
lord
,
and
Mr.
B.
's
other
friend
will
do
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
be
at
any
of
the
public
diversion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
have
carry
me
,
by
gentle
turn
,
out
of
his
workman
's
way
,
ten
mile
round
this
overgrow
capital
,
and
through
the
principal
of
its
numerous
street
.
<EOS>
the
village
that
lie
spangle
about
this
vast
circumference
,
as
well
on
the
other
side
the
noble
Thames
(
which
I
have
before
a
notion
of
,
from
Sir
John
Denham
's
celebrate
Cooper
's
Hill
)
,
as
on
the
Middlesex
side
,
be
beautiful
,
both
by
building
and
situation
,
beyond
what
I
have
imagine
,
and
several
of
them
seem
large
than
many
of
our
country
town
of
note
.
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
impertinent
to
trouble
your
ladyship
with
these
matter
,
who
be
no
stranger
to
what
be
worthy
of
notice
in
London
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
surprised
,
when
Mr.
B.
observe
to
me
,
that
this
whole
county
,
and
the
two
city
of
London
and
Westminster
,
be
represent
in
parliament
by
no
more
than
eight
member
,
when
so
many
borough
town
in
England
be
inferior
to
the
mean
village
about
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
daily
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
Miss
Darnford
,
and
then
I
shall
wish
(
accompany
by
a
young
lady
of
so
polite
a
taste
)
to
see
a
good
play
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
have
already
shew
me
the
opera
-
house
,
and
the
play
-
house
,
though
silent
,
as
I
may
say
;
that
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
observe
,
they
should
not
be
new
to
me
,
and
that
the
sight
may
not
take
off
my
attention
from
the
performance
,
when
I
go
to
the
play
;
so
that
I
can
conceive
a
tolerable
notion
of
every
thing
,
from
the
disposition
of
the
seat
,
the
box
,
gallery
,
pit
,
the
music
,
scene
,
and
the
stage
;
and
so
shall
have
no
occasion
to
gaze
about
me
,
like
a
country
novice
,
whereby
I
may
attract
a
notice
that
I
would
not
wish
,
either
for
my
own
credit
,
or
your
dear
brother
's
honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
pleasure
which
I
have
not
in
Bedfordshire
;
and
that
is
,
that
on
Sunday
I
be
at
church
,
without
gape
crowd
to
attend
us
,
and
blessing
too
loud
for
my
wish
.
<EOS>
yet
I
be
more
gazed
at
(
and
so
be
Mr.
B.
)
than
I
expect
,
consider
there
be
so
many
well
-
dress
gentry
,
and
some
nobility
there
,
and
they
stare
as
much
as
any
body
,
but
will
not
,
I
hope
,
when
we
cease
to
be
a
novelty
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
already
have
several
visitor
to
welcome
Mr.
B.
to
town
,
and
to
congratulate
him
on
his
marriage
;
but
some
,
no
doubt
,
to
see
,
and
to
find
fault
with
his
rustic
;
for
it
be
impossible
,
you
know
,
Madam
,
that
a
gentleman
so
distinguish
by
his
merit
and
fortune
should
have
take
a
step
of
such
consequence
to
himself
and
family
,
and
not
to
have
be
know
by
every
body
so
to
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Atkyns
be
in
town
,
and
have
take
apartment
in
Hanover
Square
;
and
he
bring
with
him
a
young
brother
of
Mr.
Arthur
's
,
who
,
it
seem
,
be
a
merchant
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
F.
have
also
be
to
pay
his
respect
to
Mr.
B.
whose
school
fellow
<EOS>
he
be
at
Eton

<EOS>
the
little
time
Mr.
B.
be
there

<EOS>
His
lordship
promise
,
that
his
lady
shall
make
me
a
visit
,
and
accompany
me
to
the
opera
,
as
soon
as
we
be
fully
settle
.
  
<EOS>
a
gentleman
of
the
Temple
,
Mr.
Turner
by
name
,
and
Mr.
Fanshow
of
Gray
's
Inn
,
both
lawyer
,
and
of
Mr.
B.
's
former
acquaintance
,
very
sprightly
and
modish
gentleman
,
have
also
welcome
us
to
town
,
and
make
Mr.
B.
abundance
of
gay
compliment
on
my
account
to
my
face
,
all
in
the
common
frothy
run
.
  
<EOS>
They
may
be
polite
gentleman
,
but
I
can
not
say
I
over
-
much
like
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
opiniated
,
so
seemingly
insensible
of
rebuke
,
either
from
within
or
without
,
and
yet
not
promise
to
avoid
deserve
one
occasionally
,
that
I
could
as
lieve
wish
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
they
would
not
renew
their
former
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
bold
<EOS>
your
ladyship
will
say
 
<EOS>
but
you
command
me
to
write
freely
:
yet
I
would
not
be
think
to
be
uneasy
,
with
regard
to
your
dear
brother
's
moral
,
from
these
gentleman
;
for
,
oh
,
Madam
,
I
be
a
bless
creature
,
and
be
hourly
happy
and
happy
in
the
confidence
I
have
as
to
that
particular
:
<EOS>
but
I
imagine
they
will
force
themselves
upon
him
,
more
than
he
may
wish
,
or
would
permit
,
<EOS>
be
the
acquaintance
now
to
begin
;
for
they
be
not
of
his
turn
of
mind
,
as
it
seem
to
me
;
be
,
by
a
sentence
or
two
<EOS>
that
dropt
from
them
,
very
free
,
and
very
frothy
in
their
conversation
;
and
by
their
laughing
at
what
they
say
themselves
,
take
that
for
wit
which
will
not
stand
the
test
,
if
I
may
be
allow
to
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
have
hear
,
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
what
a
person
Mr.
B.
's
goodness
to
me
have
lift
into
notice
;
and
they
think
themselves
warrant
to
say
any
thing
before
his
country
girl
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
ask
me
,
when
they
be
go
,
how
I
like
his
two
lawyer
?
<EOS>
and
say
,
they
be
person
of
family
and
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
it
,
Sir
,
"
say
I
;
"
for
their
own
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
do
not
approve
of
them

Pamela

"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
your
friend

Sir

and
I
can
not
have
any
dislike

them

"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
good
thing
sometimes
,

return
he

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

it
,
Sir

but
you
say
good
thing
always

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
happy
for
me

my

you
think
so

what

I

your

<EOS>

we
form
notion

at

sometimes

you
be
seldom
mistaken
in
yours

<EOS>

I
only
think

<EOS>
Sir
,
that
they
have
neither

their

perhaps
,
may
set
them
above
that

They
do
not
practise

themselves
any

take

<EOS>

They
seem
to
me

Sir

qualify
for
practice
:
they
would
make
great
figure
at
the
bar

I
fancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
only
,
because
they
seem
prepared
to
think
well
of
what
they
say
themselves
;

lightly
of
what
other
people
say
,

may
think
,
of
them

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
indeed
,
my
dear
,
be
the
necessary
qualification
of
a
public
speaker
,
be
he
lawyer

what
he
will
:
the
man
who
can
not
doubt
himself

can
think
meanly
of
his
auditor

never
fail
to
speak
with
self

applause

but
you
will
pardon
me
,
good
Sir

for
speak
my
mind
so
freely
,

so
early
of
these
your

<EOS>

I
never

ask
you
a
question

your

<EOS>
how
kind
,
how
indulgent
be
this

my
good
lady

you
know

how
generously
your

treat
me
,
on

this
make
me
so
bold

I

<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
,
my

lady

to
give
you
an
account
of
our
visitor
,
in
order
to
make
the
future
part
of
my
writing
the
more
intelligible
;
because
what
I
have
to
write
may
turn
sometimes
upon
the
company
we
see
:
for
which
reason
,
I
shall
also
just
mention
<EOS>
Sir
George
Stuart
,
a
scottish
gentleman
,
with
whom
Mr.
B.
become
acquaint
in
his
travel
,
who
seem
to
be
a
polite
(
and
Mr.
B.
say
,
be
a
learn
)
man
,
and
a
virtuoso
:
he
,
and
a
nephew
of
his
,
of
the
same
name
,
a
bashful
gentleman
,
and
who
,
for
that
reason
,
I
imagine
,
have
a
merit
that
lie
deep
than
a
first
observation
can
reach
,
be
just
go
from
us
,
and
be
receive
with
so
much
civility
by
Mr.
B.
as
entitle
them
to
my
respectful
regard
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
Madam
,
do
I
run
on
,
in
a
manner
,
without
material
;
and
only
to
shew
you
the
pleasure
<EOS>
I
take
in
obey
you
.
<EOS>
I
hope
my
good
Lord
Davers
enjoy
his
health
,
and
continue
me
in
his
favour
;
which
I
value
extremely
,
as
well
as
your

<EOS>
Mr.
H.
,
I
hope
,
likewise
enjoy
his
health
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
not
forget
my
particular
and
thankful
respect
to
the
Countess
,
for
her
favour
and
goodness
to
me
,
which
I
shall
ever
place
next

in

I
have
receive

your

great

your

and
obliged
servant

P.B.
    
my
dear
FATHER
and
MOTHER
,
  
<EOS>
I
write
to
you
both
,
at
this
time
,
for
your
advice
in
a
particular
dispute
,
which
be
the
only
one
I
have
have
,
or
I
hope
ever
shall
have
,
with
my
dear
benefactor
;
and
as
he
be
pleased
to
insist
upon
his
way
,
and
it
be
a
point
of
conscience
with
me
,
I
must
resolve
to
be
determine
by
your
joint
advice
;
for
,
if
my
father
and
mother
,
and
husband
,
be
of
one
opinion
,
I
must
,
I
think
,
yield
up
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
subject
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
a
mother
ought
,
if
she
can
,
to
be
the
nurse
to
her
own
child
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
say
,
he
will
not
permit
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
will
not
I
have
hear
from
him
,
or
give
occasion
for
:
<EOS>
and
I
tell
him
,
that
it
be
a
point
of
conscience
with
me
,
and
I
hope
he
will
indulge
me
:
but
<EOS>
the
dear
gentleman
have
an
odd
way
of
arguing
,
that
sometimes
puzzle
me
.
<EOS>
He
pretend
to
answer
me
from
scripture
;
but
I
have
some
doubt
of
his
exposition
;
and
he
give
me
leave
to
write
to
you
,
though
yet
he
will
not
promise
to
be
determine
by
your
opinion
if
they
be
not
the
same
with
his
own
;
and
I
say
to
him
,
"
be
this
fair
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
?
<EOS>
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
get
the
dean
's
opinion
with
him
;
for
our
debate
begin
before
we
come
to
town
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
would
not
let
me
state
the
case
;
but
do
it
himself
;
and
yet
'
tis
but
an
half
opinion
,
as
I
may
,
neither
.
<EOS>
for
it
be
,
that
if
the
husband
be
set
upon
it
,
it
be
a
wife
's
duty
to
obey
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
see
how
that
be
;
for
if
it
be
the
natural
duty
of
a
mother
,
it
be
a
divine
duty
;
and
how
can
a
husband
have
power
to
discharge
a
divine
duty
?
<EOS>
as
great
as
a
wife
's
obligation
be
to
obey
her
husband
,
which
be
,
I
own
,
one
indispensable
of
the
marriage
contract
,
it
ought
not
to
interfere
with
what
one
take
to
be
a
superior
duty
;
and
must
not
one
be
one
's
own
judge
of
action
,
by
which
we
must
stand
or
fall
?
  
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
my
plea
:
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
that
where
a
mother
be
unhealthy
;
subject
to
communicative
distemper
,
as
scrophulous
or
scorbutic
,
or
consumptive
disorder
,
which
have
infect
the
blood
or
lung
;
or
where
they
have
not
plenty
of
nourishment
for
the
child
,
that
in
these
case
,
a
dispensation
lie
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
but
where
there
be
good
health
,
free
spirit
,
and
plentiful
nourishment
,
I
think
it
an
indispensable
duty
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
be
the
custom
of
old
,
of
all
the
good
wife
we
read
of
in
scripture
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
nourishment
of
the
mother
must
be
most
natural
to
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
my
plea
,
among
other
:
and
this
be
his
answer
which
he
give
to
me
in
writing
:
  
"
<EOS>
as
to
what
you
allege
,
my
dear
,
of
old
custom
;
time
and
fashion
be
much
change
.
<EOS>
if
you
tell
me
of
Sarah
's
,
or
Rachel
's
,
or
Rebecca
's
,
or
Leah
's
nurse
their
child
,
I
can
answer
,
that
the
one
draw
water
at
a
well
,
for
her
father
's
flock
;
another
knead
cake
,
and
bake
them
on
the
hearth
;
another
dress
savoury
meat
for
her
husband
;
and
all
of
them
perform
the
common
office
of
the
household
:
and
when
our
modern
lady
shall
follow
such
example
in
every
thing
,
their
plea
ought
to
be
allow
in
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
besides
,
my
fondness
for
your
personal
grace
,
and
the
laudable
,
and
,
I
will
say
,
honest
pleasure
,
I
take
in
that
easy
,
genteel
form
,
which
every
body
admire
in
you
,
at
first
sight
,
oblige
me
to
declare
,
that
I
can
by
no
means
consent
to
sacrifice
these
to
the
carelessness
into
which
I
have
see
very
nice
lady
sink
,
when
they
become
nurse
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
my
chief
delight
in
you
be
for
the
beauty
of
your
mind
;
and
unequalle
as
they
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
you
have
still
a
genius
capable
of
great
improvement
;
and
I
shall
not
care
,
when
I
want
to
hear
my
Pamela
read
her
french
and
latin
lesson
,
which
I
take
so
much
delight
to
teach
her
(
and
to
endeavour
to
improve
myself
from
her
virtue
and
piety
,
at
the
same
time
)
,
to
seek
my
beloved
in
the
nursery
;
or
to
permit
her
to
be
engross
by
those
baby
office
,
which
will
better
befit
weak
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
,
you
must
allow
me
to
look
upon
you
as
my
scholar
,
in
one
sense
;
as
my
companion
in
another
;
and
as
my
instructress
,
in
a
third
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
be
not
govern
by
the
bad
motive
<EOS>
:
I
be
half
overcome
by
your
virtue
:
and
you
must
take
care
,
that
you
leave
not
your
work
half
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
help
look
upon
the
nurse
's
office
,
as
an
office
beneath
Pamela
.
<EOS>
let
it
have
your
inspection
,
your
direction
,
and
your
sole
attention
,
if
you
please
,
when
I
be
abroad
:
but
when
I
be
at
home
,
even
a
son
and
heir
,
so
jealous
be
I
of
your
affection
,
shall
not
be
my
rival
in
them
:
nor
will
I
have
my
rest
break
in
upon
,
by
your
servant
bring
to
you
your
dear
little
one
,
at
time
,
perhaps
,
as
unsuitable
to
my
repose
and
your
own
,
as
to
the
child
's
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
chief
thing
with
you
,
my
dear
,
be
that
you
think
it
unnatural
in
a
mother
not
to
be
a
nurse
to
her
own
child
,
if
she
can
;
and
what
be
unnatural
,
you
say
,
be
sin
.
  
<EOS>
"
some
man
may
be
fond
of
have
their
wife
undertake
this
province
,
and
good
reason
may
be
assign
for
such
their
fondness
;
but
it
suit
not
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
and
yet
no
man
would
be
think
to
have
a
great
affection
for
child
than
myself
,
or
be
more
desirous
to
do
them
justice
;
for
I
think
every
one
should
look
forward
to
posterity
with
a
preference
:
but
if
my
Pamela
can
be
better
employ
;
if
the
office
can
be
equally
well
perform
;
if
your
direction
and
superintendence
will
be
sufficient
;
and
if
I
can
not
look
upon
you
in
that
way
with
equal
delight
,
as
if
it
be
otherwise
;
I
insist
upon
it
,
my
Pamela
,
that
you
acquiesce
with
my
dispensation
,
and
do
not
think
to
let
me
lose
my
beloved
wife
,
and
have
a
nurse
put
upon
me
instead
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
that
(
the
near
to
me
of
all
)
of
danger
to
your
constitution
:
there
be
as
much
reason
to
hope
it
may
not
be
so
,
as
to
fear
that
it
may
.
<EOS>
for
child
sometimes
bring
health
with
them
as
well
as
infirmity
;
and
it
be
not
a
little
likely
,
that
the
nurse
's
office
may
affect
the
health
of
one
I
hold
most
dear
,
who
have
no
very
robust
constitution
,
and
think
it
so
much
her
duty
to
attend
to
it
,
that
she
will
abridge
herself
of
half
the
pleasure
of
life
,
and
on
that
account
confine
herself
within
door
,
or
,
in
the
other
case
,
must
take
with
her
her
infant
and
her
nursery
-
maid
wherever
she
go
;
and
I
shall
either
have
very
fine
company
(
shall
I
not
?
)
or
be
oblige
to
deny
myself
yours
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
as
I
propose
to
give
you
a
smattering
of
the
french
and
italian
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
but
I
may
take
you
on
a
little
tour
into
France
and
Italy
;
at
least
,
to
Bath
,
Tunbridge
,
Oxford
,
York
,
and
the
principal
place
of
England
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
as
I
love
to
look
upon
you
as
the
companion
of
my
pleasure
,
I
advise
you
,
my
dear
love
,
not
to
weaken
,
or
,
to
speak
in
a
phrase
proper
to
the
present
subject
,
wean
me
from
that
love
to
you
,
and
admiration
of
you
,
which
hitherto
have
be
rather
increase
than
otherwise
,
as
your
merit
,
and
regard
for
me
have
increase
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
these
,
my
dear
parent
,
be
charm
allurement
,
almost
irresistible
temptation
!
<EOS>
and
what
make
me
mistrust
myself
the
more
,
and
be
the
more
diffident
;
for
we
be
but
too
apt
to
be
persuade
into
any
thing
,
when
the
motive
be
so
tempting
as
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
grant
,
that
many
wife
will
not
choose
to
dispute
this
point
so
earnestly
as
I
have
do
;
for
we
have
have
several
little
debate
about
it
;
and
it
be
the
only
point
I
have
ever
yet
debate
with
him
;
but
one
would
not
be
altogether
implicit
neither
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
compliment
to
him
to
be
quite
passive
,
and
to
have
no
will
at
all
of
one
's
own
:
yet
would
I
not
dispute
one
point
,
but
in
supposition
of
a
superior
obligation
:
and
this
,
he
say
,
he
can
dispense
with
.
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
be
never
yet
think
so
entirely
fit
to
fill
up
the
character
of
a
casuistical
divine
,
as
that
one
may
absolutely
rely
upon
his
decision
in
these
serious
point
:
and
you
know
we
must
stand
or
fall
by
our
own
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
upon
condition
,
therefore
,
that
he
require
not
to
see
this
my
letter
,
nor
your
answer
to
it
,
I
write
for
your
advice
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
see
plainly
,
that
he
will
have
his
own
way
;
and
if
I
can
not
get
over
my
scruple
,
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
for
if
I
think
it
a
sin
to
submit
to
the
dispensation
he
insist
upon
as
in
his
power
to
grant
,
and
to
submit
to
it
,
what
will
become
of
my
peace
of
mind
?
<EOS>
for
it
be
not
in
our
power
to
believe
as
one
will
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
liberty
he
give
me
for
a
month
,
I
should
be
loath
to
take
it
;
for
one
know
not
the
inconvenience
that
may
attend
a
change
of
nourishment
;
or
if
I
do
,
I
should
rather
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
not
what
I
would
say
;
for
I
be
but
a
young
creature
to
be
in
this
way
,
and
so
very
unequal
to
it
in
every
respect
!
<EOS>
so
I
commit
myself
to
God
's
direction
,
and
your
advice
,
as
become
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
,
P.B.

My
Dearest
child

Your
mother

I
have
as
well
consider
the
case
you
put
as
we
be
able
;

your
own
reason
very
good

it
be
a
thousand
pity

will
not
allow
them
,
as
you
,
my
dear
,
make
it
such
a
point
with
you
.
<EOS>
very
few
lady
would
give
their
spouse
,
we
believe
,
the
trouble
of
this
debate
;
and
few
gentleman
be
so
very
nice
as
your
in
this
respect
;
for
I
(
but
what
signify
what
such
a
mean
soul
as
I
think
,
compare
to
so
learn
and
brave
a
gentleman
;
yet
<EOS>
I
)
always
think
your
dear
mother
,
and
she
have
be
a
pretty
woman
too
,
in
her
time
,
never
look
so
lovely
,
as
when
I
see
her
,
like
the
pelican
in
the
wilderness
,
feed
her
young
one
from
her
kind
breast
:
 
and
have
I
never
so
noble
an
estate
,
I
should
have
have
the
same
thought
.
  
<EOS>
but
since
the
good
"
squire
can
not
take
this
pleasure
;
since
he
so
much
value
your
person
;
since
he
give
you
warn
,
that
it
may
estrange
his
affection
;
since
he
be
impatient
of
denial
,
and
think
so
highly
of
his
prerogative
;
since
he
may
,
if
disoblige
,
resume
some
bad
habit
,
and
so
you
may
have
all
your
prayer
and
hope
in
his
perfect
reformation
frustrated
,
and
find
your
own
power
to
do
good
more
narrowed
:
we
think
,
besides
the
obedience
you
have
vow
to
him
,
and
be
the
duty
of
every
good
wife
,
you
ought
to
give
up
the
point
,
and
acquiesce
;
for
this
seemeth
to
us
to
be
the
less
evil
:
<EOS>
and
God
Almighty
,
if
it
should
be
your
duty
,
will
not
be
less
merciful
than
man
;
who
,
as
his
honour
say
,
by
the
law
of
the
realm
,
excuse
a
wife
,
when
she
be
faulty
by
the
command
of
the
husband
;
and
we
hope
,
the
fault
he
be
pleased
to
make
you
commit
(
if
a
fault
,
for
he
really
give
very
praise
-
worthy
motive
for
his
dispensation
)
will
not
be
lay
at
his
own
door
.
<EOS>
so
e'en
resolve
,
my
dear
child
,
to
submit
to
it
,
and
with
cheerfulness
too
.
  
<EOS>
God
send
you
an
happy
hour
!
<EOS>
but
who
know
,
when
the
time
come
,
whether
it
may
not
be
proper
to
dispense
with
this
duty
,
as
you
deem
it
,
on
other
account
?
<EOS>
for
every
young
person
be
not
enable
to
perform
it
.
<EOS>
so
,
to
shew
his
honour
,
that
you
will
cheerfully
acquiesce
,
your
dear
mother
advise
you
to
look
out
for
a
wholesome
,
good
-
humoured
,
honest
body
,
as
near
your
complexion
and
temper
,
and
constitution
,
as
may
be
;
and
it
may
not
be
the
bad
,
she
think
,
if
she
be
twenty
,
or
one
 
or
two
-
and
-
twenty
;
for
she
will
have
more
strength
and
perfection
,
as
one
may
say
,
than
even
you
can
have
at
your
tender
age
:
and
,
above
all
,
for
the
wise
reason
you
give
from
your
reading
,
that
she
may
be
bring
to
-
bed
much
about
your
time
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
We
can
look
out
,
about
us
,
for
such
an
one
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
Mr.
B.
be
not
adverse
to
have
the
dear
child
in
the
house
,
you
will
have
as
much
delight
,
and
the
dear
baby
may
fare
as
well
,
under
your
prudent
and
careful
eye
,
as
if
you
be
oblige
in
the
way
you
would
choose
.
  
<EOS>
so
God
direct
you
,
my
child
,
in
all
your
way
,
and
make
you
acquiesce
in
this
point
with
cheerfulness
(
although
,
as
you
say
,
one
can
not
believe
,
as
one
please
;
for
we
verily
be
of
opinion
you
safely
may
,
as
matter
stand
)
and
continue
to
you
,
and
your
honoured
husband
,
health
,
and
all
manner
of
happiness
,
be
the
prayer
of
your
most
affectionate
father
and
mother
,
  
J.
and
E.
ANDREWS
.
    
<EOS>
I
thank
you
,
my
dear
parent
,
for
your
kind
letter
;
it
be
give
to
Mr.
B.
and
he
bring
it
to
me
himself
,
and
be
angry
with
me
:
indeed
he
be
,
as
you
shall
hear
:
  
"
'
<EOS>
Tis
from
the
good
couple
,
my
dear
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
be
of
my
opinion
 
<EOS>
but
whether
they
be
or
not
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
leave
you
;
and
do
you
,
Pamela
,
step
down
to
my
closet
,
when
you
have
peruse
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
withdraw
;
and
I
read
it
,
and
sit
down
,
and
consider
it
well
;
but
,
as
you
know
I
make
it
always
my
maxim
to
do
what
I
could
not
avoid
to
do
,
with
as
good
a
grace
as
possible
,
I
wait
on
the
dear
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Pamela
,
"
say
he
,
a
little
seriously
,
"
what
say
the
worthy
pair
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
o
Sir
!
<EOS>
they
declare
for
you
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
it
be
good
for
me
to
yield
up
this
point
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
certainly
in
the
right
 
<EOS>
but
be
you
not
a
dear
perverse
creature
,
to
give
me
all
this
trouble
about
your
saucy
scruple
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
do
not
call
them
so
,
"
say
I
,
little
thinking
he
be
displeased
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
still
be
somewhat
wavering
;
though
they
advise
me
to
acquiesce
;
and
,
as
it
be
your
will
,
and
you
have
determine
,
it
be
my
duty
to
yield
up
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
you
yield
it
up
cheerfully
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Sir
;
and
will
never
more
dispute
it
,
let
what
will
happen
.
<EOS>
and
I
beg
pardon
for
have
so
often
enter
into
this
subject
with
you
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
,
Sir
,
if
one
's
weakness
of
mind
give
one
scruple
,
one
should
not
yield
implicitly
,
till
they
be
satisfied
;
for
that
would
look
as
if
one
give
not
you
the
obedience
of
a
free
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
obliging
,
just
now
,
my
dear
;
but
I
can
tell
you
,
you
have
make
me
half
serious
;
yet
I
would
not
shew
it
,
in
compliment
to
your
present
condition
;
for
I
do
not
expect
that
you
would
have
think
any
appeal
necessary
,
though
to
your
parent
,
in
a
point
that
I
be
determine
upon
,
as
you
must
see
,
every
time
we
talk
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
strike
me
all
in
a
heap
.
<EOS>
I
look
down
to
the
ground
:
have
no
courage
to
look
up
to
his
face
,
for
fear
I
should
behold
his
aspect
as
mortify
to
me
as
his
word
.
<EOS>
but
he
take
both
my
hand
,
and
draw
me
kindly
to
him
,
and
salute
me
,
"
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
<EOS>
my
dear
love
:
I
be
not
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
why
start
this
precious
pearl
?
"
and
kiss
my
cheek
:
<EOS>
"
speak
to
me
,
Pamela
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
<EOS>
Sir
 
I
<EOS>
will
 
as
soon
as
I
can
:
"
for
this
be
my
first
check
,
so
seriously
give
,
my
heart
be
full
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
know
he
would
be
angry
,
and
think
me
obstinate
<EOS>
,
if
I
do
not
speak
,
I
say
,
full
of
concern
,
"
I
wish
,
Sir
 
I
wish
 
you
have
be
pleased
to
spare
me
a
little
longer
,
for
the
same
kind
,
very
kind
,
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
it
not
well
,
my
dear
,
to
tell
you
I
be
a
little
out
of
humour
with
you
,
than
that
I
be
?
 
<EOS>
but
you
be
very
earnest
with
me
on
this
point
more
than
once
;
and
you
put
me
upon
a
hate
,
because
ungenerous
,
necessity
of
plead
my
prerogative
,
as
I
call
it
;
yet
this
would
not
do
,
but
you
appeal
against
me
in
the
point
I
be
determine
upon
,
for
reason
altogether
in
your
favour
:
and
if
this
be
not
like
my
Pamela
,
excuse
me
,
that
I
could
not
help
be
a
little
unlike
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
"
think
I
,
"
this
be
not
so
very
unlike
your
dear
self
,
be
I
to
give
the
least
shadow
of
an
occasion
;
for
it
be
of
a
piece
with
your
lesson
formerly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
be
not
in
the
least
aware
,
that
I
have
offend
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
too
little
circumspect
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
use
to
your
goodness
for
so
long
a
time
,
that
I
expect
it
,
it
seem
;
and
think
I
be
sure
of
your
favourable
construction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
so
you
may
be
,
my
dear
,
in
every
thing
almost
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
love
to
speak
twice
my
mind
on
the
same
subject
;
you
know
I
do
not
!
<EOS>
and
you
have
really
dispute
this
point
with
me
five
or
six
time
;
insomuch
,
that
I
wonder
what
be
come
to
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Sir
,
you
would
have
distinguish
between
a
command
where
my
conscience
be
concern
,
and
a
common
point
:
you
know
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
never
have
any
will
but
yours
in
common
point
.
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
you
make
me
fearful
because
my
task
be
render
too
difficult
for
my
own
weak
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
silent
,
but
by
my
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
doubt
,
Pamela
,
your
spirit
be
high
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
speak
,
because
you
be
out
of
humour
at
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
no
sullen
reserve
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
what
mean
that
heave
sob
?
<EOS>
I
know
that
this
be
the
time
with
your
sex
,
when
,
sadden
with
your
apprehension
,
and
indulge
because
of
them
,
by
the
fond
husband
,
it
be
needful
,
for
both
their
sake
,
to
watch
over
the
change
of
their
temper
.
<EOS>
for
lady
in
your
way
be
often
like
encroach
subject
;
apt
to
extend
what
they
call
their
privilege
,
on
the
indulgence
shew
them
;
and
the
husband
never
again
recover
the
ascendant
he
have
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
these
thing
better
than
I
,
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
intention
to
invade
your
province
,
or
to
go
out
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
yet
I
think
I
have
a
right
to
a
little
free
will
,
on
some
great
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
so
you
have
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
plead
in
behalf
of
your
own
will
,
and
refuse
to
give
due
weight
to
mine
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
Sir
,
I
must
needs
say
,
I
have
one
advantage
above
other
of
my
sex
;
for
if
wife
,
in
my
circumstance
,
be
apt
to
grow
upon
indulgence
,
I
be
very
happy
that
your
kind
and
watchful
care
will
hinder
me
from
fall
into
that
error
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
a
gentle
tap
on
the
neck
:
"
let
me
beat
my
beloved
sauce
-
box
,
"
say
he
:
"
be
it
thus
you
rally
my
watchful
care
over
you
for
your
own
good
?
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
truly
,
Pamela
,
be
you
not
a
little
sullen
?
<EOS>
look
up
to
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
be
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
be
;
but
'
tis
but
very
little
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
go
off
.
<EOS>
please
to
let
me
withdraw
,
that
I
may
take
myself
to
task
about
it;-for
at
present
,
I
know
not
what
to
do
,
because
I
do
not
expect
the
displeasure
I
have
incur
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
the
same
thing
,
"
reply
he
,
"
if
this
our
first
quarrel
end
here
,
without
your
withdrawing
?
 
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
heartily
,
my
Pamela
;
and
give
me
one
kiss
,
and
I
will
think
of
your
saucy
appeal
against
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
comply
with
your
condition
,
Sir
;
but
I
have
a
great
mind
to
be
saucy
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
let
me
for
this
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
say
,
my
dear
?
 
<EOS>
be
saucy
then
,
as
you
call
it
,
as
saucy
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
;
then
I
be
a
little
sullen
at
present
,
that
I
be
;
and
I
be
not
fully
convince
,
whether
it
must
be
I
that
forgive
you
,
or
you
me
.
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
if
I
can
recollect
,
I
can
not
think
my
fault
so
great
in
this
point
,
that
be
a
point
of
conscience
to
me
,
as
(
pardon
me
Sir
)
,
to
stand
in
need
of
your
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
will
forgive
one
another
?
<EOS>
but
take
this
with
you
,
that
it
be
my
love
to
you
that
make
me
more
delicate
than
otherwise
I
should
be
;
and
you
have
inure
me
so
much
to
a
faultless
conduct
,
that
I
can
hardly
bear
with
natural
infirmity
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
"
give
me
another
tap
,
"
get
you
go
;
I
leave
you
to
your
recollection
;
and
let
me
know
what
fruit
it
produce
:
for
I
must
not
be
put
off
with
a
half
-
compliance
;
I
must
have
your
whole
will
with
me
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
I
go
up
,
and
recollect
every
thing
,
sacrifice
to
my
sex
,
as
Mr.
B.
call
it
,
when
he
talk
of
a
wife
's
reluctance
to
yield
a
favourite
point
:
for
I
shed
many
tear
,
because
my
heart
be
set
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
my
dear
parent
,
twenty
charming
idea
and
pleasure
I
have
form
to
myself
,
be
vanish
from
me
,
and
my
measure
be
quite
broken
.
<EOS>
but
after
my
heart
be
relieve
by
my
eye
,
I
be
light
and
easy
.
<EOS>
and
the
result
be
,
we
have
hear
of
a
good
sort
of
woman
,
that
be
to
be
my
poor
baby
's
mother
,
when

come
;
so
your
kindly

offer
enquiry
be
needless
,
I
believe
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
<EOS>
well
for
our
sex
in
general
,
that
there
be
not
many
husband
who
distinguish
thus
nicely
.
<EOS>
for
,
I
doubt
,
there
be
but
very
few
so
well
entitled
to
their
lady
"
observance
as
Mr.
B.
be
to
mine
,
and
who
would
act
so
generously
and
<EOS>
so
tenderly
by
a
wife
as
he
do
,
in
every
material
instance
on
which
the
happiness
of
life
depend
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
be
quite
reconcile
;
although
as
I
say
,
upon
his
own
term
:
and
so
I
can
still
style
myself
,
my

honoured
parent
,

well
as
your

<EOS>
I
be
glad
you

safe
to
town
:
and
long
to
hear
of
Miss

's
arrival
,
because
I
know
you
will
be
out
of
your
bias
in
your
new
settlement
till
then
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
fine
lady
,
and
write
the
most
to
my
taste
of
any
one
of
her
sex
that
I
know
,
next
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
would
be
so
kind
as
to
correspond
with
me
.
<EOS>
but
be
sure
do
not
omit
to
give
me
the
sequel
of
her
sister
's
and
Murray
's
affair
,
and
what
you
think
will
please
me
in
relation
to
her.-You
do
well
to
save
yourself
the
trouble
of
describe
the
town
and
the
public
place
.
<EOS>
We
be
no
stranger
to
them
;
and
they
be
too
much
our
table
talk
,
when
any
country
lady
have
for
the
first
time
be
carry
to
town
,
and
return
:
besides
,
what
London
afford
,
be
nothing
that
deserve
mention
,
compare
to
what
we
have
see
at
Paris
and
at
Versailles
,
and
other
of
the
french
palace
.
<EOS>
You
exactly
,
therefore
,
hit
our
taste
,
and
answer
our
expectation
,
when
you
give
us
,
in
your
peculiar
manner
,
sentiment
on
what
we
may
call
the
soul
of
thing
,
and
such
character
as
you
draw
with
a
pencil
borrow
from
the
hand
of
nature
,
intermingle
with
those
fine
light
and
shade
of
reflection
and
observation
,
that
make
your
picture
glow
,
and
instruct
as
well
as
delight
.
  
<EOS>
there
,
Pamela
,
be
encouragement
for
you
to
proceed
in
oblige
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
of
one
mind
in
this
respect
;
and
more
than
ever
,
since
we
have
see
your
action
so
well
answer
to
your
writing
;
and
that
theory
and
practice
,
as
to
every
excellence
that
can
adorn
a
lady
,
be
the
same
thing
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
pleased
with
your
lawyer
'
character
.
<EOS>
there
be
life
and
nature
in
them
;
but
never
avoid
give
all
that
occur
to
you
,
for
that
seem
to
be
one
of
your
talent
;
and
in
the
ugly
,
there
will
be
matter
of
instruction
;
especially
as
you
seem
naturally
to
fall
upon
such
as
be
so
general
,
that
no
one
who
converse
,
but
must
see
in
them
the
picture
of
one
or
other
he
be
acquaint
with
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
perhaps
,
Miss
Darnford
will
be
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Our
respect
to
her
,
if
so
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
have
be
at
some
of
the
theatrical
entertainment
:
so
will
not
want
subject
to
oblige
us
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
a
good
thought
of
your
dear
man
's
,
to
carry
you
to
see
the
several
house
,
and
to
make
you
a
judge
,
by
that
mean
,
of
the
disposition
and
fashion
of
every
thing
in
them.-Tell
him
<EOS>
,
I
love
him
better
and
better
.
<EOS>
I
be
proud
of
my
brother
,
and
do
nothing
but
talk
of
what
a
charming
husband
he
make
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
he
give
an
example
to
all
who
know
him
,
and
his
uncontrollable
temper
(
which
make
against
many
of
us
)
,
that
it
be
possible
for
a
good
wife
to
make
even
a
bad
man
a
worthy
husband
:
and
this
afford
an
instruction
,
which
may
stand
all
our
sex
in
good
stead
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
they
must
have
be
cautious
first
,
to
choose
a
man
of
natural
good
sense
,
and
good
manner
,
and
not
a
brutal
or
abandon
debauchee
.
  
<EOS>
but
hark
-
ye
-
me
,
my
sweet
girl
,
what
have
I
do
,
that
you
will
not
write
yourself
sister
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
could
find
in
my
heart
to
be
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
before
my
last
visit
,
I
be
scrupulous
to
subscribe
myself
so
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
since
I
have
see
myself
so
much
surpassed
in
every
excellence
,
that
I
would
take
pleasure
in
the
name
,
you
assume
a
pride
in
your
turn
,
and
may
think
it
under
-
value
yourself
,
to
call
me
so
 
<EOS>
ay
,
that
be
the
thing
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
 
although
I
have
endeavour
by
several
regulation
since
my
return
(
and
the
countess
,
too
,
keep
your
example
in
distant
view
,
as
well
as
I
)
,
to
be
more
worthy
of
the
appellation
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
you
would
avoid
the
reproach
of
secret
pride
,
under
the
shadow
of
so
remarkable
an
humility
,
for
the
future
never
omit
subscribe
as
I
do
,
with
great
pleasure
,
your
truly
affectionate
sister
and
friend
,
B.
DAVERS
.
  
<EOS>
I
always
take
it
for
grant
,
that
my
worthy
brother
send
his
respect
to
us
;
as
you
must
,
that
Lord
Davers
,
the
Countess
of
C.
and
Jackey
(
who
,
as
well
as
his
uncle
,
talk
of
nothing
else
but
you
)
,
send
theirs
;
and
so
unnecessary
compliment
will
be
always
exclude
our
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
in
answer
to
the
precede
.
  
<EOS>
how
you
overwhelm
me
with
your
goodness
,
my
dear
lady
,
in
every
word
of
your
last
welcome
letter
,
be
beyond
my
power
to
express
I
<EOS>
how
nobly
have
your
ladyship
contrive
,
in
your
ever
-
value
present
,
to
encourage
a
doubting
and
apprehensive
mind
!
<EOS>
and
how
do
it
contribute
to
my
joy
and
my
glory
,
that
I
be
deem
by
the
noble
sister
of
my
good
beloved
,
not
wholly
unworthy
of
be
the
humble
mean
to
continue
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
perpetuate
,
a
family
so
ancient
and
so
honourable
!
  
<EOS>
when
I
contemplate
this
,
and
look
upon
what
I
be
 
how
shall
I
express
a
sense
of
the
honour
do
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
,
read
over
the
other
engaging
particular
in
your
ladyship
's
letter
,
I
come
to
the
last
charming
paragraph
,
I
be
doubly
affected
to
see
myself
seemingly
upbraided
,
but
so
politely
embolden
to
assume
an
appellation
,
that
otherwise
I
hardly
dare
.
  
<EOS>
I
 
humble
<EOS>
I
 
who
never
have
a
sister
before
 
to
find
one
now
in
Lady
Davers
!
<EOS>
o
Madam
,
you
,
and
only
you
,
can
teach
me
word
fit
to
express
the
joy
and
the
gratitude
that
fill
my
delighted
heart
!
 
<EOS>
but
thus
much
I
be
teach
,
that
there
be
some
thing
more
than
the
low
-
bear
can
imagine
in
birth
and
education
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
evident
in
your
ladyship
's
action
,
word
,
and
manner
,
that
it
strike
one
with
a
become
reverence
;
and
we
look
up
with
awe
to
a
condition
we
emulate
in
vain
,
when
raise
by
partial
favour
,
like
what
I
have
find
;
and
be
confound
when
we
see
grandeur
of
soul
join
with
grandeur
of
birth
and
condition
;
and
a
noble
lady
act
thus
nobly
,
as
Lady
Davers
act
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
wish
,
and
a
thousand
blessing
,
attend
your
ladyship
in
all
you
undertake
!
<EOS>
and
I
be
persuade
the
latter
will
,
and
a
peace
and
satisfaction
of
mind
incomparably
to
be
prefer
to
whatever
else
this
world
can
afford
,
in
the
new
regulation
,
<EOS>
which
you
,
and
my
dear
lady
countess
,
have
set
on
foot
in
your
family
:
and
when
I
can
have
the
happiness
to
know
what
they
be
,
I
shall
,
I
be
confident
,
greatly
improve
my
own
method
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
be
we
to
live
for
ever
in
this
life
,
we
may
be
careless
and
indifferent
about
these
matter
:
but
when
such
an
uncertainty
as
to
the
time
,
and
such
a
certainty
as
to
the
event
be
before
us
,
a
prudent
mind
will
be
always
prepare
,
till
prepared
;
and
what
can
be
a
well
preparative
,
than
charitable
action
to
our
fellow
-
creature
in
the
eye
of
that
Majesty
,
which
want
nothing
of
us
himself
,
but
to
do
just
the
merciful
thing
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
pardon
me
,
my
dear
lady
,
for
this
my
free
style
.
<EOS>
Methinks
I
be
out
of
myself
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
descend
all
at
once
from
the
height
to
which
you
have
raise
me
:
and
you
must
forgive
the
reflection
to
which
you
yourself
and
your
own
noble
action
have
give
birth
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
have
take
respite
a
little
,
I
naturally
sink
into
body
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
will
not
your
ladyship
confine
your
expectation
from
me
within
narrow
limit
?
 
<EOS>
for
,
o
,
I
can
not
even
with
my
wish
,
so
swiftly
follow
your
expectation
,
if
such
they
be
!
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
leave
futurity
to
HIM
,
who
only
govern
futurity
,
and
who
conduct
us
all
,
and
our
affair
,
as
shall
best
answer
his

divine
purpose

I
will
proceed
as
well
as
I
can
,
to
obey
you
in
those
article

which
be

at

more
within

You
see

my

say
I
,
"
what
it
be
to
be
wed
to
a
generous
man

<EOS>
Mr.
B.
,
by
his
noble
treatment
of
me
,
create
a
merit
in
me
,
and
disclaim
the
natural
effect
of
his
own
goodness

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
be
a
charming
couple
 
person
and
mind
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
any
equal
either
of
you
have
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Mr.
B.
,
I
will
not
compliment
you
too
highly
.
<EOS>
I
may
make
you
proud
,
for
man
be
saucy
creature

I
can
not
make
your
lady
so
:
and
in
this
doubt
of
the
one
,
and
confidence
in
the
other
,
I
must
join
with
you
,
that
her
merit
be
the
great

<EOS>
since
,
excuse
me
,
Sir
,
her
example
have
reform
her
rake

you
have
only
confirm
in
her
the
virtue
you
find
ready
form
to
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
distinction

say
Mr.

be
worthy
of
Miss

<EOS>
"
My

Miss

my

say
I
,
lay
my
hand
upon
the
hand
of
each
,

how
can
you
go
on
thus
!
 
<EOS>
as
I
look
upon
every
kind
thing
,
two
such
dear
friend
say
of
me
,
as
incentive
for
me
to
endeavour
to
deserve
it
,
you
must
not
ask
me
too
high
;
for
then
,
instead

,
you
will
make
me
despair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lead
us
into
the
coach
;
and
in
a
free
,
easy
,
joyful
manner
,
not
in
the
least
tired
or
fatigued
,
do
we
reach
the
town
and
Mr.
B.
's
house
;
with
which
and
its
furniture
,
and
the
apartment
allot
for
her
,
my
dear
friend
be
highly
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
dear
lady
put
me
into
some
little
confusion
,
when
she
see
me
first
,
take
notice
of
my
improvement
,
as
she
call
them
,
before
Mr.
B.
I
look
at
him
and
her
with
a
downcast
eye
.
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
say
,
"
Would
you
,
my
good
Miss
Darnford
,
look
so
silly
,
after
such
a
length
of
time
,
with
a
husband
you
need
not
be
ashamed
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
Sir
,
not
I
,
I
will
assure
you
;
nor
will
I
forgive
those
maiden
air
in
a
wife
so
happy
as
you
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
I
wish
myself
,
in
mind
and
behaviour
,
to
be
just
what
Miss
Darnford
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
lady
,
Miss
Darnford
have
have
those
early
advantage
from
conversation
,
which
I
have
not
;
and
so
must
never
expect
to
know
how
to
deport
myself
with
that
modest
freedom
and
ease
,
which
I
know
I
want
,
and
shall
always
want
,
although
some
of
my
partial
favourer
think
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
for
I
be
every
day
more
and
more
sensible
of
the
great
difference
there
be
between
be
use
to
the
politest
conversation
as
an
inferior
,
and
be
bear
to
bear
a
part
in
it
:
in
the
one
,
all
be
set
,
stiff
,
awkward
,
and
the
person
just
such
an
ape
of
imitation
as
poor
I
;
in
the
other
,
all
be
natural
ease
and
sweetness
 
like
Miss
Darnford
.
  
<EOS>
know
this
,
I
do
not
indeed
aim
at
what
I
be
sensible
I
can
not
attain
;
and
so
,
I
hope
,
be
less
expose
to
censure
than
I
should
be
if
I
do
.
<EOS>
for
,
I
have
hear
Mr.
B.
observe
with
regard
to
gentleman
who
build
fine
house
,
make
fine
garden
,
and
open
fine
prospect
,
that
art
should
never
take
place
of
,
but
be
subservient
to
,
nature
;
and
a
gentleman
,
if
confine
to
a
situation
,
have
well
conform
his
design
to
that
,
than
to
do
as
at
Chatsworth
,
level
a
mountain
at
a
monstrous
expense
;
which
,
have
it
be
suffer
to
remain
,
in
so
wild
and
romantic
a
scene
as
Chatsworth
afford
,
may
have
be
make
one
of
the
great
beauty
of
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
think
I
have
well
endeavour
to
make
the
good
of
those
natural
defect
I
can
not
master
,
than
,
by
assume
air
and
dignity
in
appearance
,
to
which
I
be
not
bear
,
act
neither
part
tolerably
.
<EOS>
by
this
mean
,
instead
of
be
think
neither
gentlewoman
nor
rustic
,
as
Sir
Jacob
hint
(
linsey
-
wolsey
,
I
think
be
his
term
too
)
,
I
may
be
look
upon
as
an
original
in
my
way
;
and
all
original
pass
well
enough
,
you
know
,
Madam
,
even
with
judge
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
be
upon
this
subject
,
I
can
form
to
myself
,
if
your
ladyship
will
excuse
me
,
two
such
polite
gentleman
as
my
lawyer
mention
in
my
former
,
who
,
with
a
true
London
magnanimity
and
penetration
(
for
,
Madam
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
your
London
critic
will
be
the
severe
upon
the
country
girl
)
,
will
put
on
mighty
significant
look
,
forget
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
,
that
they
have
any
fault
themselves
,
and
apprehend
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
other
,
one
of
them
express
himself
after
this
manner
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
truly
,
Jack
,
the
girl
be
well
enough
 
<EOS>
consider
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
"
(
then
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
add
importance
to
his
air
)
 
<EOS>
"
but
a
man
may
love
her
for
a
month
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
(
these
spark
talk
thus
of
other
lady
before
me
.
)
<EOS>
"
She
behave
better
than
I
expect
from
her
 
considering
"
again
will
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
think
,
"
cry
the
other
,
and
toss
his
tie
behind
him
,
with
an
air
partly
of
contempt
,
and
partly
of
rakery
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
Jemmy
,
I
expect
to
find
an
awkward
country
girl
,
but
she
top
her
part
,
I
will
assure
you
!
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
for
that
matter
,
behave
very
tolerably
for
what
she
be
 
<EOS>
and
be
right
,
not
to
seem
desirous
to
drown
the
remembrance
of
her
original
in
her
elevation
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
can
not
but
say
"
(
for
something
like
it
he
do
say
)
<EOS>
,
"
be
mighty
pretty
,
and
passably
genteel
.
"
<EOS>
and
thus
with
their
poor
praise
of
Mr.
B.
's
girl
,
they
think
they
have
make
a
fine
compliment
to
his
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
but
for
his
sake
(
for
as
to
my
own
,
I
be
not
solicitous
about
such
gentleman
's
good
opinion
)
,
I
owe
them
a
spite
;
and
believe
,
I
shall
find
an
opportunity
to
come
out
of
their
debt
.
<EOS>
for
I
have
the
vanity
to
think
,
now
you
have
make
me
proud
by
your
kind
encouragement
and
approbation
,
that
the
country
girl
will
make
'em
look
about
them
,
with
all
their
genteel
contempt
,
which
they
miscall
praise
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
I
run
on
!
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
expect
that
I
shall
write
as
freely
to
you
as
I
use
to
do
to
my
parent
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
merit
of
obey
you
,
that
I
have
;
but
,
I
doubt
,
too
much
to
the
exercise
of
your
patience
.
  
<EOS>
this
(
like
all
mine
)
be
a
long
letter
;
and
I
will
only
add
to
it
Miss
Darnford
's
humble
respect
,
and
thank
for
your
ladyship
's
kind
mention
of
her
,
which
she
receive
as
no
small
honour
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
with
a
great
pleasure
than
I
can
express
,
will
I
make
use
of
the
liberty
you
so
kindly
allow
me
to
take
,
of
subscribe
myself
with
that
profound
respect
which
become
me
,
your

P.B.
  
Mr.

Mr.

and
our

now
complete

<EOS>
from
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
B.
  
my
dear
pamela
,
  
after
I
have
thank
you
for
your
last
agreeable
letter
,
which
have
add
the
Earl
and
Lady
Jenny
to
the
number
of
your
admirer
(
you
know
Lady
Betty
,
her
sister
,
be
so
before
)
<EOS>
,
I
shall
tell
you
,
that
I
now
write
,
at
their
request
,
as
well
as
at
those
of
my
Lord
Davers
,
the
countess
you
so
dearly
love
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
for
your
decision
of
an
odd
dispute
,
that
,
on
read
your
letter
,
and
talk
of
your
domestic
excellency
,
happen
among
us
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Betty
say
,
that
,
notwithstanding
any
awkwardness
you
attribute
to
yourself
,
she
can
not
but
decide
,
by
all
she
have
see
of
your
writing
,
and
hear
from
us
,
that
yours
be
the
perfect
character
she
ever
find
in
the
sex
.
  
<EOS>
the
countess
say
,
that
you
wrong
yourself
in
suppose
you
be
not
every
thing
that
be
polite
and
genteel
,
as
well
in
your
behaviour
,
as
in
your
person
;
and
that
she
know
not
any
lady
in
England
who
better
become
her
station
than
you
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
Lady
Jenny
,
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
must
be
quite
perfect
:
that
be
certain
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
the
earl
;
so
say
they
all
.
<EOS>
and
Lord
Davers
confirm
that
you
be
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
as
we
be
sure
,
there
can
not
be
such
a
character
in
this
life
as
have
not
one
fault
,
although
we
could
not
tell
where
to
fix
it
,
the
countess
make
a
whimsical
motion
:
<EOS>
"
Lady
Davers
,
"
say
she
,
"
pray
do
you
write
to
Mrs.
B.
and
acquaint
her
with
our
subject
;
and
as
it
be
impossible
,
for
one
who
can
act
as
she
do
,
not
to
know
herself
better
than
any
body
else
can
do
,
desire
her
to
acquaint
us
with
some
of
those
secret
foible
,
that
leave
room
for
her
to
be
still
more
perfect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
good
thought
,
"
say
they
all
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
present
occasion
of
my
writing
;
and
pray
see
that
you
accuse
yourself
,
of
no
more
than
you
know
yourself
guilty
:
for
over
-
modesty
border
nearly
on
pride
,
and
too
liberal
self
-
accusation
be
generally
but
so
many
trap
for
acquittal
with
applause
:
so
that
(
whatever
other
lady
may
)
you
will
not
be
forgive
,
if
you
deal
with
us
in
a
way
so
poorly
artful
;
let
your
fault
,
therefore
,
be
such
as
you
think
we
can
subscribe
to
,
from
what
we
have
see
of
you
and
what
we
have
read
of
yours
;
and
you
must
try
to
extenuate
them
too
,
as
you
give
them
,
lest
we
should
think
you
above
that
nature
,
which
,
in
the
good
case
,
be
your
undoubted
talent
.
  
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
and
Miss
Damford
on
her
arrival
:
she
be
a
charming
young
lady
;
but
tell
her
,
that
we
shall
not
allow
her
to
take
you
at
your
word
,
and
to
think
that
she
excel
you
in
any
one
thing
:
<EOS>
only
,
indeed
,
we
think
you
nicer
in
some
point
<EOS>
than
you
need
be
to
,
as
to
your
present
agreeable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
the
easy
,
unaffected
,
conjugal
purity
,
in
word
and
behaviour
,
between
your
good
man
and
you
,
be
worthy
of
imitation
,
and
what
the
countess
<EOS>
and
I
have
with
pleasure
contemplate
since
we
leave
you
,
an
hundred
time
,
and
admire
in
you
both
:
and
it
be
good
policy
too
,
child
,
as
well
as
high
decorum
;
for
it
be
what
will
make
you
ever
new
and
respectful
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
but
you
have
the
honour
of
it
all
,
<EOS>
whose
sweet
,
natural
,
and
easy
modesty
,
in
person
,
behaviour
,
and
conversation
,
forbid
indecency
,
even
in
thought
,
much
more
in
word
,
to
approach
you
:
insomuch
that
no
rake
can
be
rake
in
your
presence
,
and
yet
they
hardly
know
to
what
they
owe
their
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
people
who
see
you
at
this
time
,
will
take
it
for
grant
that
you
and
Mr.
B.
have
be
very
intimate
together
,
I
should
think
you
nee
not
be
ashamed
of
your
appearance
,
because
,
as
he
rightly
observe
,
you
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
your
husband
.
  
<EOS>
excuse
my
pleasantry
,
my
dear
:
and
answer
our
demand
upon
you
,
as
soon
as
you
can
;
which
will
oblige
us
all
;
particularly
your
affectionate
sister
,
  
B.
DAVERS
.
    
<EOS>
my
DEAREST
lady
,
  
<EOS>
what
a
task
have
you
impose
upon
me
!
<EOS>
and
accord
to
the
term
you
annex
to
it
,
how
shall
I
acquit
myself
of
it
,
without
incur
the
censure
of
affectation
,
if
I
freely
accuse
myself
as
I
may
deserve
,
or
of
vanity
,
if
I
do
not
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
Madam
,
I
have
a
great
many
failing
:
and
you
do
not
know
the
pain
it
cost
me
to
keep
them
under
;
not
so
much
for
fear
the
world
should
see
them
,
<EOS>
for
I
bless
God
,
I
can
hope
they
be
not
capital
,
as
for
fear
they
should
become
capital
,
if
I
be
to
let
them
grow
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
,
surely
,
I
need
not
have
tell
your
ladyship
,
and
the
Countess
of
C.
,
who
have
read
my
paper
,
and
see
my
behaviour
in
the
kind
visit
you
make
to
your
dear
brother
,
and
have
from
both
but
too
much
reason
to
censure
me
,
do
not
your
generous
and
partial
favour
<EOS>
make
you
overlook
my
great
failing
,
and
pass
under
a
kinder
name
many
of
my
less
;
for
surely
,
my
good
lady
,
you
must
both
of
you
have
observe
,
in
what
you
have
read
and
see
,
that
I
be
naturally
of
a
saucy
temper
:
<EOS>
and
with
all
my
appearance
of
meekness
and
humility
,
can
resent
,
and
ste
too
,
when
I
think
myself
provoke
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
also
discover
in
myself
,
on
many
occasion
(
of
some
of
which
I
will
by
-
and
-
by
remind
your
ladyship
)
,
a
malignancy
of
heart
,
that
,
it
be
true
,
last
but
a
little
while
 
nor
have
it
need
 
but
for
which
I
have
often
call
myself
to
account
 
to
very
little
purpose
hitherto
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
Madam
(
now
for
a
little
extenuation
,
as
you
expect
from
me
)
,
I
have
some
difficulty
,
whether
I
ought
to
take
such
pain
to
subdue
myself
in
some
instance
,
in
the
station
to
which
I
be
raise
,
that
otherwise
it
would
have
become
me
to
attempt
to
do
:
for
it
be
no
easy
task
,
for
one
in
my
circumstance
,
to
distinguish
between
the
ought
and
the
ought
not
;
to
be
humble
without
meanness
,
and
decent
without
arrogance
.
<EOS>
and
if
all
person
think
as
justly
as
I
flatter
myself
I
do
,
of
the
inconvenience
,
as
well
as
convenience
,
which
attend
their
be
raise
to
a
condition
above
them
,
they
would
not
imagine
all
the
world
be
their
own
,
when
they
come
to
be
distinguish
as
I
have
be
:
for
,
<EOS>
what
with
the
contempt
of
superior
relation
on
one
side
,
the
envy
of
the
world
,
and
low
reflection
arise
from
it
,
on
the
other
,
from
which
no
one
must
hope
to
be
totally
exempt
,
and
the
awkwardness
,
besides
,
with
which
they
support
their
elevated
condition
,
if
they
have
sense
to
judge
of
their
own
imperfection
;
and
if
the
gentleman
be
not
such
an
one
as
mine
(
and
where
will
such
another
be
find
?
)
 
<EOS>
on
all
these
account
,
I
say
,
they
will
be
make
sensible
,
that
,
whatever
they
may
once
think
,
happiness
and
an
high
estate
be
two
very
different
thing
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
too
grave
,
when
your
ladyship
,
and
all
my
kind
and
noble
friend
,
expect
,
perhaps
,
I
should
give
the
uncommon
subject
a
pleasanter
air
:
yet
what
must
that
mind
be
,
that
be
not
serious
,
when
oblige
to
recollect
,
and
give
account
of
its
defect
?
  
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
only
accuse
myself
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
I
must
give
proof
,
such
as
your
ladyship
can
subscribe
to
,
of
my
imperfection
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
real
kindness
in
this
seem
hardship
,
that
I
will
obey
you
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
and
produce
proof
in
a
moment
,
which
can
not
be
controvert
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
my
sauciness
,
those
paper
will
give
an
hundred
instance
against
me
,
as
well
to
your
dear
brother
,
as
to
other
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
extenuate
,
as
you
command
me
,
as
I
go
along
,
these
be
mostly
when
I
be
apprehensive
for
my
honour
,
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
have
a
little
tincture
of
jealousy
,
which
sometimes
have
make
me
more
uneasy
than
I
ought
to
be
,
as
the
paper
you
have
not
see
would
have
demonstrate
,
particularly
in
Miss
Godfrey
's
case
,
and
in
my
conversation
with
your
ladyship
,
in
which
I
have
frequently
betray
my
fear
of
what
may
happen
when
in
London
:
<EOS>
yet
,
to
extenuate
again
,
I
have
examine
myself
very
strictly
on
this
head
;
and
really
think
,
that
I
can
ascribe
a
great
part
of
this
jealousy
to
laudable
motive
;
no
less
than
to
my
concern
for
your
dear
brother
's
future
happiness
,
in
the
hope
,
that
I
may
be
a
humble
mean
,
through
Providence
,
to
induce
him
to
abhor
those
crime
of
which
young
gentleman
too
often
be
guilty
,
and
bring
him
over
to
the
practice
of
those
virtue
,
in
which
he
will
ever
have
cause
to
rejoice
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
my
lady
,
some
other
part
of
the
charge
must
stand
against
me
;
for
as
I
love
his
person
,
as
well
as
his
mind
,
I
have
pride
in
my
jealousy
,
that
would
not
permit
me
,
I
verily
think
,
to
support
myself
as
I
ought
,
under
trial
of
a
competition
,
in
this
very
tender
point
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
oblige
me
to
own
<EOS>
,
that
I
have
a
little
spark
 
not
a
little
one
,
perhaps
of
secret
pride
and
vanity
,
that
will
arise
,
now
and
then
,
on
the
honour
do
me
;
but
which
I
keep
under
as
much
as
I
can
;
and
to
this
pride
,
let
me
tell
your
ladyship
<EOS>
,
I
know
no
one
contribute
,
or
can
contribute
,
more
largely
than
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
so
you
see
,
<EOS>
my
dear
lady
,
what
a
naughty
heart
I
have
,
and
how
far
I
be
from
be
a
faultless
creature
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
be
well
and
well
,
however
,
as
I
live
longer
,
and
have
more
grace
,
and
more
wit
:
for
here
to
recapitulate
my
fault
,
be
in
the
first
place
,
vindictiveness
,
<EOS>
I
will
not
call
it
downright
revenge
 
<EOS>
and
how
much
room
do
all
these
leave
for
amendment
,
and
great
perfection
?
  
<EOS>
have
your
ladyship
,
and
the
countess
,
favour
us
longer
in
your
kind
visit
<EOS>
,
I
must
have
so
improve
,
by
your
charming
conversation
,
and
by
that
natural
ease
and
dignity
which
accompany
everything
your
ladyship
do
and
say
,
as
to
have
get
over
such
of
these
foible
as
be
not
root
in
nature
:
till
in
time
I
have
be
able
to
do
more
than
emulate
those
perfection
,
which
at
present
,
I
can
only
at
an
awful
distance
revere
;
as
become

my
dear

your
most
humble

my

<EOS>
I
arrive
safely
in
London
on
Thursday
,
after
a
tolerable
journey
,
consider
Deb
<EOS>
and
I
make
six
in
the
coach
<EOS>
(
two
have
be
take
up
on
the
way
,
after
you
leave
me
)
,
and
none
of
the
six
highly
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
and
his
lady
,
who
look
very
stately
upon
us
(
from
the
circumstance
of
person
,
rather
than
of
mind
,
however
)
,
be
so
good
as
to
meet
me
at
St.
Alban
's
,
in
their
coach
and
six
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
fine
house
here
,
richly
furnish
in
every
part
,
and
have
allot
me
the
good
apartment
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
happy
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
be
a
charming
husband
;
so
easy
,
so
pleased
with
,
and
so
tender
of
his
lady
:
<EOS>
and
she
so
much
all
that
we
see
her
in
the
country
,
as
to
humility
and
affability
,
and
improve
in
every
thing
else
which
we
hardly
think
possible
she
could
be
 
that
I
never
know
so
happy
a
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
prerogative
sauciness
,
which
we
apprehend
would
so
eminently
display
itself
in
his
behaviour
to
his
wife
,
have
she
be
ever
so
distinguish
by
birth
and
fortune
,
be
vanish
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
be
in
the
power
of
an
angel
,
if
our
sex
could
have
produce
one
,
to
have
make
so
tender
and
so
fond
<EOS>
a
husband
of
Mr.
B.
as
he
make
.
<EOS>
and
should
I
have
the
sense
to
follow
Mrs.
B.
's
example
,
if
ever
I
marry
,
I
should
not
despair
of
make
myself
happy
<EOS>
,
let
it
be
to
whom
it
would
,
provide
he
be
not
a
brute
,
nor
sordid
in
his
temper
;
which
two
character
be
too
obvious
to
be
conceal
,
if
person
take
due
care
,
and
make
proper
inquiry
,
and
if
they
be
not
lead
by
blind
passion
.
<EOS>
May
Mr.
Murray
and
Miss
Nancy
make
just
such
a
happy
pair
!
  
<EOS>
You
command
me
,
my
honour
mamma
,
to
write
to
you
an
account
of
every
thing
that
please
me
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
:
<EOS>
but
what
a
task
should
I
then
have
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
have
undertake
to
write
volume
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
therefore
allow
me
to
be
more
brief
than
I
have
intend
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
it
would
take
up
five
or
six
long
letter
to
do
justice
to
the
economy
observe
in
this
happy
family
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
Mrs.
B.
have
not
change
one
of
her
servant
,
and
only
add
her
Polly
to
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
unexampled
thing
,
especially
as
they
be
her
fellow
-
servant
as
we
may
say
:
but
since
they
have
the
sense
to
admire
so
good
an
example
,
and
be
proud
to
follow
it
,
each
to
his
and
her
power
,
I
think
it
one
of
her
peculiar
facility
to
have
continue
them
,
and
to
choose
to
reform
such
as
be
exceptionable
rather
than
dismiss
them
.
  
<EOS>
Their
mouth
,
Deb
tell
me
,
be
continually
full
of
their
lady
's
praise
,
and
prayer
,
and
blessing
,
utter
with
such
delight
and
fervour
for
the
happy
pair
,
that
it
make
her
eye
,
she
say
,
ready
to
run
over
to
hear
them
.
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
I
think
it
an
extraordinary
degree
of
policy
(
whether
design
or
not
)
to
keep
them
,
as
they
be
all
worthy
folk
;
for
have
she
turn
them
off
,
what
have
she
do
but
make
as
many
enemy
as
she
have
discard
servant
;
and
as
many
more
as
those
have
friend
and
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
and
we
all
know
,
how
much
the
reputation
of
family
lie
at
the
mercy
of
servant
;
and
it
be
easy
to
guess
to
what
cause
each
would
have
impute
his
or
her
dismission
.
<EOS>
and
so
she
have
escape
,
as
she
ought
,
the
censure
of
pride
;
and
make
every
one
,
instead
of
reproach
her
with
her
descent
,
find
those
grace
in
her
,
which
turn
that
very
disadvantage
to
her
glory
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
exceedingly
affable
;
always
speak
to
them
with
a
smile
;
but
yet
have
such
a
dignity
in
her
manner
,
that
it
secure
her
their
respect
and
reverence
;
and
they
be
ready
to
fly
at
a
look
,
and
seem
proud
to
have
her
command
to
execute
;
insomuch
,
that
the
word
 
"
My
lady
command
so
,
or
so
,
"
from
one
servant
to
another
,
be
sure
to
meet
with
an
indisputable
obedience
,
be
the
duty
require
what
it
will
.
  
<EOS>
if
any
of
them
be
the
least
indisposed
,
her
care
and
tenderness
for
them
engage
the
veneration
and
gratitude
of
all
the
rest
,
who
see
how
kindly
they
will
be
treat
,
should
they
ail
any
thing
themselves
.
<EOS>
and
in
all
this
she
be
very
happy
in
Mrs.
Jervis
,
who
be
an
excellent
second
to
her
admirable
lady
;
and
be
treat
by
her
with
as
much
respect
and
affection
,
as
if
she
be
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
remember
,
Madam
,
that
in
the
account
she
give
us
of
her
benevolent
round
,
as
Lady
Davers
call
it
,
she
say
,
that
as
she
be
go
to
London
,
she
should
instruct
Mrs.
Jervis
about
some
of
her
client
,
as
I
find
she
call
her
poor
,
to
avoid
a
word
which
her
delicacy
account
harsh
with
regard
to
them
,
and
ostentatious
with
respect
to
herself
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
,
how
(
since
,
contrary
to
her
then
expectation
,
Mrs.
Jervis
be
permit
to
be
in
town
with
her
)
<EOS>
she
have
provide
to
answer
her
intention
as
to
those
her
client
,
whom
she
have
refer
to
the
care
of
that
good
woman
?
  
<EOS>
She
say
,
that
Mr.
Barlow
,
her
apothecary
,
be
a
very
worthy
man
,
and
she
have
give
him
a
plenary
power
in
that
particular
,
and
likewise
desire
him
to
recommend
any
new
and
worthy
case
to
her
that
no
deserve
person
among
the
destitute
sick
poor
,
may
be
unrelieve
by
reason
of
her
absence
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
in
London
she
have
apply
herself
to
Dr.
#
#
#
#
(
her
parish
minister
,
a
fine
preacher
,
and
<EOS>
sound
divine
,
who
promise
on
all
opportunity
to
pay
his
respect
to
Mr.
B.
)
to
recommend
to
her
any
poor
housekeeper
,
who
would
be
glad
to
accept
of
some
private
benefaction
,
and
yet
,
have
live
creditably
,
till
reduce
by
misfortune
,
be
ashamed
to
apply
for
public
relief
:
and
she
have
several
of
these
already
on
her
benevolent
list
,
to
some
of
whom
she
send
coal
now
at
the
entrance
on
the
wintry
season
,
to
some
a
piece
of
irish
or
scottish
linen
,
or
so
many
yard
of
Norwich
stuff
,
for
gown
and
coat
for
the
girl
,
or
Yorkshire
cloth
for
the
boy
;
and
money
to
some
,
who
she
be
most
assured
will
lay
it
out
with
care
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
moreover
mortify
,
as
the
Scots
call
it
,
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
as
a
fund
for
loan
,
without
interest
,
of
five
,
ten
,
or
fifteen
,
but
not
exceed
twenty
pound
,
to
answer
some
present
exigence
in
some
honest
family
,
who
find
the
good
security
they
can
,
to
repay
it
in
a
give
time
;
and
this
fund
,
she
purpose
,
as
she
grow
rich
,
she
say
,
to
increase
;
and
estimate
pleasantly
her
worth
by
this
sum
,
say
sometimes
,
"
who
would
ever
have
think
I
should
have
be
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
<EOS>
so
soon
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
a
rich
body
in
time
.
"
<EOS>
but
in
all
these
thing
,
she
enjoin
secresy
,
which
the
doctor
have
promise
.
  
<EOS>
She
tell
the
doctor
what
Mr.
Adams
's
office
be
in
her
family
;
and
hope
,
she
say
,
he
would
give
her
his
sanction
to
it
;
assure
him
,
that
she
think
it
her
duty
to
ask
it
,
as
she
be
one
of
his
flock
,
and
he
,
on
that
account
,
her
principal
shepherd
,
which
make
a
spiritual
relation
between
them
,
the
requisite
of
which
,
on
her
part
,
be
not
to
be
dispense
with
.
<EOS>
the
good
gentleman
very
cheerfully
and
applaudingly
give
his
consent
;
and
when
she
tell
him
how
well
Mr.
Adams
be
provide
for
,
and
that
she
would
apply
to
him
to
supply
her
with

You

do
me
the
justice
,
Madam

to
believe
,
that
I
very
cheerfully
join
in
my
dear

Sunday
duty

I
be
not
a

edified

with
the
good

and
the
harmony
and
good

will
that
this
excellent
method
preserve
in
the

<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
family
of
love
in
my
life
:
for
here
,
under
the
eye
of
the
good
of
mistress
,
they
twice
every
Sunday
see
one
another
all
together
(
as
they
use
to
do
in
the
country
)
,
superior
as
well
as
inferior
servant
;
and
Deb
tell
me

after
Mrs.
B.

such
friendly

that

"

I

cry
Jonathan

the

Good

"
cry
another

"
you

<EOS>
and
they
return
to
their
several
vocation
,
so
light
,
so
easy
,
so
pleased
,
so
even
-
temper
in
their
mind
,
as
their
cheerful
countenance
,
as
well
as
expression
,
testify
,
that
it
be
a
heaven
of
a
house
:
and
be
wind
up
thus
constantly
once
a
week
,
at
least
,
like
a
good
eight
-
day
clock
,
<EOS>
no
piece
of
machinery
that
ever
be
make
be
so
regular
and
uniform
as
this
family
be
.
  
<EOS>
what
an
example
do
this
dear
lady
set
to
all
who
see
her
,
know
her
,
and
who
hear
of
her
;
how
happy
they
who
have
the
grace
to
follow
it
!
<EOS>
what
a
public
blessing
would
such
a
mind
as
her
be
,
could
it
be
vest
with
the
robe
of
royalty
,
and
adorn
the
sovereign
dignity
!
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
prince
of
the
earth
,
look
at
them
in
every
nation
,
and
what
they
have
be
for
age
past
,
compare
to
this
lady
?
<EOS>
who
act
from
the
impulse
of
her
own
heart
,
unaide
in
most
case
,
by
any
human
example
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
when
I
contemplate
her
innumerable
excellency
,
and
that
sweetness
of
temper
,
and
universal
benevolence
,
which
shine
in
every
thing
she
say
and
do
,
I
can
not
sometimes
help
look
upon
her
in
the
light
of
an
angel
,
drop
down
from
heaven
,
and
receive
into
bodily
organ
,
to
live
among
man
and
woman
,
in
order
to
shew
what
the
first
of
the
specie
be
design
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
here
,
be
the
admiration
,
that
one
see
all
these
duty
perform
in
such
an
easy
and
pleasant
manner
,
as
any
body
may
perform
them
;
for
they
interfere
not
with
any
part
of
the
family
management
;
but
rather
aid
and
inspirit
<EOS>
every
one
in
the
discharge
of
all
their
domestic
service
;
and
,
moreover
,
keep
their
mind
in
a
state
of
preparation
for
the
more
solemn
duty
of
the
day
;
and
all
without
the
least
intermixture
of
affectation
,
enthusiasm
,
or
ostentation
.
<EOS>
o
my
dear
papa
and
mamma
,
permit
me
but
to
tarry
here
till
I
be
perfect
in
all
these
good
lesson
,
and
how
happy
shall
I
be
!
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
town
,
and
the
diversion
of
it
,
I
shall
not
trouble
you
with
any
account
,
as
,
from
your
former
thorough
knowledge
of
both
,
you
will
want
no
information
about
them
;
for
,
generally
speak
,
all
who
reside
constantly
in
London
,
allow
,
that
there
be
little
other
difference
in
the
diversion
of
one
winter
and
another
,
than
such
as
be
in
clothe
;
a
few
variation
of
the
fashion
only
,
which
be
mostly
owing
to
the
ingenious
contrivance
of
person
who
be
to
get
their
bread
by
diversify
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
have
undertake
to
give
Lady
daver
an
account
of
the
matter
as
they
pass
,
and
her
sentiment
on
what
she
see
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
something
new
in
her
observation
,
because
she
be
a
stranger
to
these
diversion
,
and
unbiasse
entirely
by
favour
or
prejudice
;
and
so
will
not
play
the
partial
critic
,
but
give
to
a
beauty
its
due
praise
,
and
to
a
fault
its
due
censure
,
accord
to
that
truth
and
nature
which
be
the
unerring
guide
of
her
action
as
well
as
sentiment
.
<EOS>
these
I
will
transcribe
for
you
;
and
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
return
them
when
peruse
,
because
I
will
lend
them
,
as
I
use
to
do
her
letter
,
to
her
good
parent
;
and
so
I
shall
give
her
a
pleasure
at
the
same
time
in
the
accommodate
them
with
the
knowledge
of
all
that
pass
,
<EOS>
which
she
make
it
a
point
of
duty
to
do
,
because
they
take
delight
in
her
writing
.
  
<EOS>
My
papa
's
observation
,
that
a
woman
never
take
a
journey
<EOS>
but
she
forget
something
,
be
justify
by
me
;
for
,
with
all
my
care
,
I
have
leave
my
diamond
buckle
,
which
Miss
Nancy
will
find
in
the
inner
till
of
my
bureau
,
wrapt
up
in
cotton
;
and
I
beg
it
may
be
send
me
by
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
with
my
humble
duty
to
you
both
,
my

indulgent
papa

thank
for
the
favour
I
now
rejoice
in

affectionate
respect

Miss

(
I
wish
she
would
love
me
as
well
as
I
love
her

,
and

your

<EOS>
Mr.

desire
their

also
to
your

they
desire
their
kind

and
thank
for
the
loan

your
worthless
daughter

<EOS>
I
experience
every
hour
some
new
token
of
their
politeness
and
affection
;
and
I
make
no
scruple
to
think
I
be
with
such
a
brother
,
and
such
a
sister
as
any
happy
creature
may
rejoice
in
,
and
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
I
can
not
but
repeat
,
be
a
charming
husband
,
and
a
most
polite
gentleman
.
<EOS>
His
lady
be
always
accuse
herself
to
me
of
awkwardness
and
insufficiency
;
but
not
a
soul
who
see
her
can
find
it
out
;
she
be
all
genteel
ease
;
and
the
admiration
of
every
one
who
behold
her
.
<EOS>
only
I
tell
her
,
with
such
happiness
in
possession
,
she
be
a
little
of
the
gravest
sometimes
.
    
<EOS>
from
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
my
good
lady
,
  
<EOS>
You
command
me
to
acquaint
you
with
the
proceeding
between
Mr.
Murray
and
Miss
Nanny
Darnford
:
and
Miss
Polly
make
it
easy
for
me
to
obey
you
in
this
particular
,
and
in
very
few
word
;
for
she
say
,
every
thing
be
adjust
before
she
come
away
,
and
the
ceremony
,
she
believe
,
may
be
perform
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
She
rejoice
that
she
be
out
of
the
way
of
it
:
for
,
she
say
,
love
be
so
awkward
a
thing
to
Mr.
Murray
,
and
good
-
humour
so
uncommon
an
one
to
Miss
Nancy
,
that
she
hope
she
shall
never
see
such
another
courtship
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
be
at
the
play
-
house
several
time
;
and
,
give
me
leave
to
say
,
Madam
,
(
for
I
have
now
read
as
well
as
see
several
)
,
that
I
think
the
stage
,
by
proper
regulation
,
may
be
make
a
profitable
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
but
nothing
more
convince
one
of
the
truth
of
the
common
observation
,
that
the
good
thing
,
corrupt
,
prove
the
bad
,
than
these
representation
.
<EOS>
the
terror
and
compunction
for
evil
deed
,
the
compassion
for
a
just
distress
,
and
the
general
beneficence
which
those
lively
exhibition
be
so
capable
of
raise
in
the
human
mind
,
may
be
of
great
service
,
when
direct
to
right
end
,
and
induce
by
proper
motive
:
particularly
where
the
action
which
the
catastrophe
be
design
to
punish
,
be
not
set
in
such
advantageous
light
,
as
shall
destroy
the
end
of
the
moral
,
and
make
the
vice
that
ought
to
be
censure
,
imitable
;
where
instruction
be
keep
in
view
all
the
way
,
and
where
vice
be
punish
,
and
virtue
reward
.
  
<EOS>
but
give
me
leave
to
say
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
there
be
hardly
one
play
I
have
see
,
or
read
hitherto
,
but
have
too
much
of
love
in
it
,
as
that
passion
be
generally
treat
.
<EOS>
how
unnatural
in
some
,
how
inflame
in
other
,
be
the
description
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
in
most
,
rather
rant
and
fury
,
like
the
love
of
the
fiercer
brute
animal
,
as
Virgil
,
translate
by
Dryden
,
describe
them
,
than
the
soft
,
sigh
,
fearfully
hopeful
murmur
,
that
swell
the
bosom
of
our
gentler
sex
:
and
the
respectful
,
timorous
,
submissive
complaining
of
the
other
,
when
the
truth
of
the
passion
humanize
,
as
one
may
say
,
their
more
rugged
heart
.
  
<EOS>
in
particular
,
what
strange
indelicate
do
these
writer
of
tragedy
often
make
of
our
sex
!
<EOS>
They
do
not
enter
into
the
passion
at
all
,
if
I
have
any
notion
of
it
;
but
when
the
author
want
to
paint
it
strongly
(
at
least
in
those
play
I
have
see
and
read
)
<EOS>
their
aim
seem
to
raise
a
whirlwind
,
as
I
may
say
,
which
sweep
down
reason
,
religion
,
and
decency
;
and
carry
every
laudable
duty
away
before
it
;
so
that
all
the
example
can
serve
to
shew
be
,
how
a
disappointed
lover
may
rage
and
storm
,
resent
and
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
the
play
I
first
see
be
the
tragedy
of
the
Distressed
Mother
;
and
a
great
many
beautiful
thing
I
think
there
be
in
it
:
but
half
of
it
be
a
tempestuous
,
cruel
,
ungoverned
rant
of
passion
,
and
end
in
cruelty
,
bloodshed
,
and
desolation
,
which
the
truth
of
the
story
not
warrant
,
as
Mr.
B.
tell
me
,
make
it
the
more
pity
,
that
the
original
author
(
for
it
be
a
french
play
,
translate
,
you
know
,
Madam
)
,
have
not
conduct
it
,
since
it
be
his
choice
,
with
less
terror
,
and
with
great
propriety
,
to
the
passion
intend
to
be
raise
,
and
actually
raise
in
many
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
epilogue
speak
after
the
play
,
by
Mrs.
Oldfield
,
in
the
character
of
Andromache
,
be
more
shocking
to
me
,
than
the
most
terrible
part
of
the
play
;
as
by
lewd
and
even
senseless
double
entendre
,
it
could
be
calculate
only
to
efface
all
the
tender
,
all
the
virtuous
sentiment
,
which
the
tragedy
be
design
to
raise
.
  
<EOS>
the
pleasure
this
give
the
man
be
equally
barbarous
and
insulting
;
all
turn
to
the
box
,
pit
,
and
gallery
,
where
lady
be
,
to
see
how
they
look
,
and
stand
an
emphatical
and
too
-
well
pronounce
ridicule
,
not
only
upon
the
play
in
general
,
but
upon
the
part
of
Andromache
in
particular
,
which
have
be
so
well
sustain
by
an
excellent
actress
;
and
I
be
extremely
mortified
to
see
my
favourite
(
and
the
only
perfect
)
character
debase
and
despoil
,
and
the
widow
of
Hector
,
prince
of
Troy
,
talk
nastiness
to
an
audience
,
and
set
it
out
with
all
the
wicked
grace
of
action
,
and
affect
archness
of
look
,
attitude
,
and
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
up
 
"
Dear
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
!
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
my
love
?
"
say
Mr.
B.
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
have
I
weep
the
distress
of
the
injure
Hermione
?
"
<EOS>
whisper
I
:
<EOS>
"
why
have
I
be
move
by
the
murder
of
the
brave
Pyrrhus
,
and
shock
by
the
madness
of
Orestes
!
<EOS>
be
it
for
this
?
<EOS>
see
you
not
Hector
's
widow
,
the
noble
Andromache
,
invert
the
design
of
the
whole
play
,
satirize
her
own
sex
,
but
indeed
most
of
all
ridicule
and
shame
,
in
my
mind
,
that
part
of
the
audience
,
who
can
be
delight
with
this
vile
epilogue
,
after
such
scene
of
horror
and
distress
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
say
,
smile
,
"
I
expect
,
my
dear
,
that
your
delicacy
,
and
Miss
Darnford
's
too
,
would
be
shock
on
this
preposterous
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
this
play
,
rake
as
I
be
,
but
the
impropriety
of
the
epilogue
send
me
away
dissatisfied
with
it
,
and
with
human
nature
too
:
and
you
only
see
,
by
this
one
instance
,
what
a
character
that
of
an
actor
or
actress
be
,
and
how
capable
they
be
to
personate
any
thing
for
a
sorry
subsistence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
there
not
,
think
you
,
extravagant
scene
and
character
enough
in
most
play
to
justify
the
censure
of
the
virtuous
upon
them
,
that
the
wicked
friend
of
the
author
must
crown
the
work
in
an
epilogue
,
for
fear
the
audience
should
go
away
improve
by
the
representation
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
I
see
,
always
narrowness
of
spirit
,
as
I
have
hear
some
say
,
that
open
the
mouth
of
good
people
against
these
diversion
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
wild
way
talk
I
;
for
I
be
quite
out
of
patience
at
this
unnatural
and
unexpected
piece
of
ridicule
,
tack
to
so
serious
a
play
,
and
come
after
such
a
moral
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
speciman
,
my
dear
lady
,
of
my
observation
on
the
first
play
I
see
.
<EOS>
how
just
or
how
impertinent
,
I
must
leave
to
your
well
judgment
.
<EOS>
I
very
probably
expose
my
ignorance
and
folly
in
them
,
but
I
will
not
say
presumption
,
because
you
have
put
me
upon
the
task
,
which
otherwise
I
should
hardly
have
attempt
.
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
reason
therefore
to
blame
myself
on
this
score
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
if
I
can
escape
your
ladyship
's
censure
,
have
cause
to
pride
myself
in
the
opportunity
you
have
thereby
give
me
to
shew
my
readiness
to
obey
you
;
and
the
rather
,
since
I
be
sure
of
your
kind
indulgence
,
now
you
have
give
me
leave
to
style
myself
your
ladyship
's
oblige
sister
,
and
humble
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
my
dear
lady
,
  
<EOS>
I
give
you
in
my
last
my
bold
remark
upon
a
TRAGEDY
-
the
Distressed
Mother
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
give
you
my
shallow
notion
of
a
comedy
 
the
Tender
Husband
.
  
<EOS>
I
like
this
part
of
the
title
;
though
I
be
not
pleased
with
the
other
,
explanatory
of
it
;
or
 
the
Accomplished
Fools
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
hear
it
be
write
by
Sir
Richard
Steele
,
and
that
Mr.
Addison
have
give
some
hint
towards
it
,
if
not
some
character
 
<EOS>
"
o
,
dear
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
give
us
your
company
to
this
play
;
for
the
author
of
the
Spectator
can
not
possibly
produce
a
faulty
scene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
indeed
smile
;
for
I
have
not
then
read
the
play
:
and
the
Earl
of
F.
,
his
countess
,
Miss
Darnford
,
Mr.
B.
and
myself
,
agree
to
meet
with
a
niece
of
my
lord
's
in
the
stage
-
box
,
which
be
take
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
there
seem
to
me
to
be
much
wit
and
satire
in
the
play
:
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
be
grievously
disappoint
as
to
the
morality
of
it
;
nor
,
in
some
place
,
be
 
probability
preserve
;
and
there
be
diver
speech
so
very
free
,
that
I
could
not
have
expect
to
meet
with
such
,
from
the
name
I
mention
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
the
author
seem
to
have
forget
the
moral
all
the
way
;
and
be
put
in
mind
of
it
by
some
kind
friend
(
Mr.
Addison
,
perhaps
)
,
be
at
a
loss
to
draw
one
from
such
character
and
plot
as
he
have
produce
;
and
so
put
down
what
come
uppermost
,
for
the
sake
of
custom
,
without
much
regard
to
propriety
.
<EOS>
and
truly
,
I
should
think
,
that
the
play
be
begin
with
a
design
to
draw
more
amiable
character
,
answerable
to
the
title
of
the
Tender
Husband
;
but
that
the
author
,
be
carry
away
by
the
luxuriancy
of
a
genius
,
which
he
have
not
the
heart
to
prune
,
on
a
general
survey
of
the
whole
,
distrust
the
propriety
of
that
title
,
add
the
under
one
:
with
an
OR
,
the
Accomplished
Fools
,
in
justice
to
his
piece
,
and
compliment
to
his
audience
.
<EOS>
have
he
call
it
<EOS>
the
accomplished
Knaves
,
I
would
not
have
be
angry
at
him
,
because
there
would
have
be
more
propriety
in
the
title
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
,
for
the
sake
of
the
author
,
have
praise
every
scene
of
this
play
:
I
hope
to
have
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
Judge
then
,
my
dear
lady
,
my
mortification
,
not
to
be
able
to
say
I
like
above
one
,
the
Painter
's
scene
,
which
too
be
out
of
time
,
be
on
the
wedding
-
day
;
and
be
force
to
disapprove
of
every
character
in
it
,
and
the
view
of
every
one
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
dear
Madam
,
your
most
oblige
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
Dear
Lady
,
  
<EOS>
although
I
can
not
tell
how
you
receive
my
observation
on
the
tragedy
of
the
Distressed
Mother
,
and
the
comedy
of
the
Tender
Husband
,
yet
will
I
proceed
to
give
your
ladyship
my
opinion
of
the
opera
<EOS>
I
be
at
last
night
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
can
I
say
,
after
mention
what
you
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
know
,
the
fine
scene
,
the
genteel
and
splendid
company
,
the
charming
voice
,
and
delightful
music
?
  
<EOS>
if
,
Madam
,
one
be
all
ear
,
and
lose
to
every
sense
but
that
of
harmony
,
surely
the
italian
opera
would
be
a
transporting
thing
!
 
<EOS>
but
when
one
find
good
sense
,
and
instruction
,
and
propriety
,
sacrifice
to
the
charm
of
sound
,
what
an
unedifying
,
what
a
mere
temporary
delight
do
it
afford
!
<EOS>
for
what
do
one
carry
home
,
but
the
remembrance
of
have
be
please
so
many
hour
by
the
mere
vibration
of
air
,
which
,
be
but
sound
,
you
can
not
bring
away
with
you
;
and
must
therefore
enter
the
time
pass
in
such
a
diversion
,
into
the
account
of
those
blank
hour
,
from
which
one
have
not
reap
so
much
as
one
improve
lesson
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
observe
,
that
when
once
sound
be
prefer
to
sense
,
we
shall
depart
from
all
our
own
worthiness
,
and
,
at
best
,
be
<EOS>
but
the
ape
,
yea
,
the
dupe
,
of
those
whom
we
may
strive
to
imitate
,
but
never
can
reach
,
much
less
excel
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
say
,
sometimes
,
that
this
taste
be
almost
the
only
good
fruit
our
young
nobility
gather
,
and
bring
home
from
their
foreign
tour
;
and
that
he
find
the
english
nation
much
ridicule
on
this
score
,
by
those
very
people
who
be
benefit
by
their
depravity
.
<EOS>
and
if
this
be
the
good
,
what
must
the
other
qualification
be
,
which
they
bring
home
?
 
<EOS>
yet
every
one
do
not
return
with
so
little
improvement
,
it
be
to
be
hope
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
can
I
say
of
an
italian
opera
?
 
<EOS>
for
who
can
describe
sound
!
<EOS>
or
what
word
shall
be
find
to
embody
air
?
<EOS>
and
when
we
return
,
and
be
ask
our
opinion
of
what
we
have
see
or
hear
,
we
be
only
able
to
answer
,
as
I
hint
above
the
scenery
<EOS>
be
fine
,
the
company
splendid
and
genteel
,
the
music
charm
for
the
time
,
the
action
not
extraordinary
,
the
language
unintelligible
,
and
,
for
all
these
reason
 
<EOS>
the
instruction
none
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
the
thing
itself
give
me
room
to
say
of
the
italian
opera
;
very
probably
,
for
want
of
a
polite
taste
,
and
a
knowledge
of
the
language
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
next
,
I
believe
,
I
shall
give
you
,
Madam
,
my
opinion
of
a
diversion
,
which
,
I
doubt
,
I
shall
like
still
less
,
and
that
be
a
masquerade
;
<EOS>
for
I
fear
I
shall
not
be
excuse
go
to
one
,
although
I
have
no
manner
of
like
to
it
,
especially
in
my
present
way
.
<EOS>
I
be
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
your
ladyship
's
most
obliged
and
faithful
<EOS>
P.B.
  
<EOS>
I
must
add
another
half
sheet
to
this
letter
on
the
subject
matter
of
it
,
the
opera
;
and
be
sure
you
will
not
be
displeased
with
the
addition
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
come
up
just
as
I
have
conclude
my
letter
,
ask
me
what
be
my
subject
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
give
your
ladyship
my
notion
of
the
italian
opera
.
"
<EOS>
let
me
see
what
they
be
,
my
dear
;
for
this
be
a
subject
that
very
few
of
those
who
admire
these
performance
,
and
few
still
of
those
who
decry
them
,
know
any
thing
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
read
the
above
,
and
be
pleased
to
commend
it
.
<EOS>
"
opera
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
very
sad
thing
in
England
,
to
what
they
be
in
Italy
;
and
the
translation
give
of
them
abominable
:
and
indeed
,
our
language
will
not
do
them
justice
.
  
<EOS>
"
every
nation
,
as
you
say
,
have
its
excellency
;
and
ours
should
not
quit
the
manly
nervous
sense
,
which
be
the
distinction
of
the
english
drama
.
<EOS>
one
play
of
our
celebrated
Shakespeare
will
give
infinitely
more
pleasure
to
a
sensible
mind
than
a
dozen
english
-
italian
opera
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
,
in
Italy
,
they
be
quite
another
thing
:
and
the
sense
be
not
,
as
here
,
sacrifice
so
much
to
the
sound
,
but
that
they
be
both
very
compatible
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
pleased
,
Sir
,
to
give
me
your
observation
on
this
head
in
writing
,
and
then
I
shall
have
something
to
send
worthy
of
Lady
Davers
's
acceptance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
my
dear

he
take
a
pen
,
and
write
the
inclose
;
which
I
beg
your
ladyship
to
return
me
;
because
I
will
keep
it
for
my
instruction
,
if
I
should
be
lead
to
talk
of
this
subject
in
company

<EOS>
"

my

that
I

myself
no

peruse
what
I

She
will
do
well

therefore

to
correct
it

return
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
in
Italy
,
judge
of
opera
be
so
far
from
think
the
drama
or
poetical
part
of
their
opera
nonsense
,
as
the
unskille
in
Italian
rashly
conclude
in
England
,
that
if
the
Libretto
,
as
they
call
it
,
be
not
approve
,
the
opera
,
notwithstanding
the
excellence
of
the
music
,
will
be
condemn
.
<EOS>
for
the
Italians
justly
determine
,
that
the
very
music
of
an
opera
can
not
be
complete
and
pleasing
,
if
the
drama
be
incongruous
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
in
its
composition
,
because
,
in
order
to
please
,
it
must
have
the
necessary
contrast
of
the
grave
and
the
light
,
that
is
,
the
divert
equally
blend
through
the
whole
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
too
much
of
the
first
,
let
the
music
be
compose
ever
so
masterly
in
that
style
,
it
will
become
heavy
and
tiresome
;
if
the
latter
prevail
,
it
will
surfeit
with
its
levity
<EOS>
:
wherefore
it
be
the
poet
's
business
to
adapt
the
word
for
this
agreeable
mixture
:
for
the
music
be
but
secondary
,
and
subservient
to
the
word
;
and
if
there
be
an
artful
contrast
in
the
drama
,
there
will
be
the
same
in
the
music
,
suppose
the
composer
to
be
a
skilful
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
since
in
England
,
the
practice
have
be
to
mutilate
,
curtail
,
and
patch
up
a
drama
in
Italian
,
in
order
to
introduce
favourite
air
,
select
from
different
author
,
the
contrast
have
always
be
break
thereby

without
every
one

since
ignorant
mercenary
prompter

Italians

have
be
employ
in
hotch

potch
,
and
in
translate
our
drama
from
Italian
into
English

how
could
such
opera
appear
any
other
than
incongruous
nonsense
?
"
  
<EOS>
permit
me

to
repeat
my

your

P.B.
    
<EOS>
well
,
now
,
my
dear
lady
,
I
will
give
you
my
poor
opinion
of
a
masquerade
,
to
which
Mr.
B.
persuade
me
to
accompany
Miss
Darnford
;
for
,
as
I
hint
in
my
former
,
I
have
a
great
indifference
,
or
rather
dislike
,
to
go
,
and
Miss
therefore
want
so
powerful
a
second
,
to
get
me
with
her
;
because
I
be
afraid
<EOS>
the
freedom
which
I
have
hear
be
use
there
,
would
not
be
very
agreeable
to
my
apprehensive
temper
,
at
this
time
especially
.
  
<EOS>
but
find
Mr.
B.
choose
to
have
me
go
,
if
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
say
,
I
have
no
objection
,
"
I
say
,
I
will
have
none
<EOS>
,
I
can
have
none
,
when
you
tell
me
it
be
your
choice
;
and
so
send
for
the
habit
you
like
,
and
that
you
would
have
me
appear
in
,
and
I
will
cheerfully
attend
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
habit
Mr.
B.
pitch
upon
be
that
of
a
Spanish
Don
,
and
it
well
befit
the
majesty
of
his
person
and
air
;
and
Miss
Darnford
choose
that
of
a
young
Widow
;
and
Mr.
B.
recommend
that
of
a
Quaker
for
me
.
<EOS>
We
all
admire
one
another
in
our
dress
;
and
Mr.
B.
promise
to
have
me
always
in
his
eye
,
we
go
thither
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
never
desire
to
be
present
at
another
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
be
single
out
by
a
bold
Nun
,
who
talk
italian
to
him
with
such
free
air
,
that
I
do
not
much
like
it
,
though
I
know
not
what
she
say
;
for
I
think
the
dear
gentleman
no
more
keep
to
his
spanish
gravity
,
than
she
to
the
requisite
of
the
habit
she
wear
:
when
I
have
imagine
that
all
that
be
tolerable
in
a
masquerade
,
be
the
acting
up
to
the
character
each
person
assume
:
and
this
give
me
no
objection
to
the
Quaker
's
dress
;
for
I
think
I
be
prim
enough
for
that
naturally
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
softly
,
"
Dear
Miss
Darnford
"
(
for
Mr.
B.
and
the
Nun
be
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
)
,
"
what
be
become
of
that
Nun
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
rather
,
"
whisper
she
,
"
what
be
become
of
the
Spaniard
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
Cardinal
attack
me
instantly
in
French
;
but
I
answer
in
English
,
not
know
what
he
say
,
"
quaker
be
not
fit
company
for
Red
-
hat

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
,
"
say
he
,
in
the
same
language
;
"
for
a
Quaker
and
a
Jesuit
be
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
be
address
by
the
name
of
the
Sprightly
Widow
:
<EOS>
another
ask
,
how
long
she
intend
to
wear
those
weed
?
<EOS>
and
a
footman
,
in
a
rich
livery
,
answer
for
her
eye
,
through
her
mask
,
that
it
would
not
be
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
startle
when
a
Presbyterian
Parson
come
up
,
and
bid
me
look
after
my
Musidorus
 
<EOS>
so
that
I
doubt
not
by
this
,
it
must
be
one
who
know
my
name
to
be
Pamela
;
and
I
soon
think
of
one
of
my
lawyer
,
whose
character
I
give

<EOS>
indeed
,
he
need
not
to
bid
me
;
for
I
be
sorry
,
on
more
account
than
that
of
my
timorousness

to
have
lose
sight
of
him

<EOS>
"
out
upon
these
nasty
masquerade
!

I
;

I
can
not
abide
them
already

<EOS>
an
egregious
beauish
appearance
come
up
to
Miss

and
say
,
"
You

very
pretty

any

in
my
opinion

<EOS>
I
whisper
this

<EOS>

I
whisper
another

she

She
affect
a
laugh

<EOS>
He

to
me

I
be
afraid
of
some
such

thou

I

to
Miss

<EOS>
so
lovely
a
widow

so
sweet
a
friend

<EOS>
no
wonder
you
do
not
separate
:
for
I
see
not
in
this
various
assembly

third
person

with
you

<EOS>

not

Sir

I.

Will

the

with
a
noble

I
do
not

join
us

speak
in
italian
something
very
free
,
as
it
seem
by
her
manner
,
and
Mr.
B.
's
smiling
answer
;
but
neither
Miss
Darnford

I
understand
that
language

Mr.
B.
would
not
explain
it
to
us

<EOS>
but
she
give
him
a
signal
to
follow
her

seem
to
be
much

he
be

the

glass

eat
a

<EOS>
"
I
thank
thee

I

for
thy
counsel

if
thou

pleased

look
at

thou
wouldst
not

take
so
much
pain

such
advice

such
an

She

<EOS>
"
verily

neither

I
:

out
of

curiosity

to
look
into

mind

I

<EOS>
a
roman
Senator
just
then
accost
Miss
Darnford
;
and
Mr.

see
me
so
much
engaged

"
'
<EOS>
twere
hard
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
our
nation

in

produce
not

cavalier

"
though
surround

not

my
good
knight

errant

say
the
Nun
:
"
<EOS>
the
fair
Quaker

be
too
hard
for

a

dozen

your
poor

whisper
she

Mr.

answer
her
in
Italian
(
I
wish
I
understand
Italian
!
)
 
<EOS>
and
she
have
recourse
to
her
bead
.
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
,
<EOS>
Madam
,
how
this
Nun
haunt
him
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
these
masquerade
at
all
.
<EOS>
many
lady
,
on
these
occasion
,
be
so
very
free
,
that
the
censorious
will
be
apt
to
blame
the
whole
sex
for
their
conduct
,
and
to
say
,
their
heart
be
as
faulty
as
those
of
the
most
culpable
man
,
since
they
scruple
not
to
shew
as
much
,
when
they
think
they
can
not
be
know
by
their
face
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
my
humble
opinion
,
that
could
a
standard
be
fix
,
by
which
one
could
determine
readily
what
be
,
and
what
be
not
wit
,
decency
would
not
be
so
often
wound
by
attempt
to
be
witty
,
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
for
here
every
one
,
who
can
say
thing
that
shock
a
modester
person
,
not
meet
with
due
rebuke
,
but
perhaps
a
smile
,
(
without
consider
whether
it
be
of
contempt
or
approbation
)
mistake
courage
for
wit
;
and
every
thing
sacred
or
civil
become
the
subject
of
his
frothy
jest
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
a
moralizer
be
I
!
<EOS>
will
your
ladyship
say
:
indeed
I
can
not
help
it
:
 
and
especially
on
such
a
subject
as
a
masquerade
,
which
I
dislike
more
than
any
thing
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
I
could
say
a
great
deal
more
on
this
occasion
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
be
quite
out
of
humour
with
it
:
for
I
like
my
English
Mr.
B.
better
than
my
Spaniard
:
and
the
Nun
I
approve
not
by
any
mean
;
though
there
be
some
who
observe
,
that
she
be
one
of
the
gracefull
figure
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
in
spite
of
my
own
heart
,
I
could
not
help
think
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
know
so
well
what
masquerade
be
,
that
I
may
well
be
excuse
say
any
thing
further
on
a
subject
<EOS>
I
be
so
little
pleased
with
:
for
you
only
desire
my
notion
of
those
diversion
,
because
I
be
a
novice
in
them
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
doubly
serve
to
answer
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
only
therefore
add
,
that
after
an
hundred
other
impertinence
speak
to
Miss
Darnford
and
me
,
and
retort
with
spirit
by
her
,
and
as
well
as
I
could
by
myself
,
quite
sick
of
the
place
,
I
feign
to
be
more
indisposed
than
I
be
,
and
so
get
my
beloved
Spaniard
to
go
off
with
us
,
and
reach
home
by
three
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
and
so
much
for
masquerade
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
never
have
occasion
to
mention
them
again
to
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
my
dear
Madam
,
your
ever
oblige
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
my
dearest
lady
,
  
<EOS>
My
mind
be
so
wholly
engross
by
thought
of
a
very
different
nature
from
those
which
the
diversion
of
the
town
and
theatre
inspire
,
that
I
beg
to
be
excuse
,
if
,
for
the
present
,
I
say
nothing
further
of
those
light
matter
.
<EOS>
but
as
you
do
not
disapprove
of
my
remark
,
I
intend
,
if
God
spare
my
life
,
to
make
a
little
book
,
which
I
will
present
to
your
ladyship
,
of
my
poor
observation
on
all
the
dramatic
entertainment
I
have
see
,
and
shall
see
,
this
winter
:
and
for
this
purpose
I
have
make
brief
note
in
the
margin
of
the
print
play
I
have
buy
,
as
I
see
them
,
with
a
pencil
;
by
refer
to
which
,
as
help
to
my
memory
,
I
shall
be
able
to
state
what
my
thought
be
at
the
time
of
see
them
pretty
nearly
with
the
same
advantage
,
as
if
I
have
write
them
at
my
return
from
each
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
obtain
Sir
Simon
,
and
Lady
Darnford
's
permission
for
Miss
to
stay
with
me
till
it
shall
be
see
how
it
will
please
God
to
deal
with
me
,
and
I
owe
this
favour
partly
to
a
kind
letter
write
in
my
behalf
to
Sir
Simon
,
by
Mr.
B.
,
and
partly
to
the
young
lady
's
earnest
request
to
her
papa
,
to
oblige
me
;
Sir
Simon
have
make
some
difficulty
to
comply
,
as
Mr.
Murray
and
his
bride
have
leave
them
,
say
,
he
could
not
live
long
,
if
he
have
not
the
company
of
his
beloved
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
shall
I
say
,
when
I
find
my
frailty
so
much
increase
,
that
I
can
not
,
with
the
same
intenseness
of
devotion
I
use
to
be
bless
with
,
apply
myself
to
the
throne
of
grace
,
nor
,
of
consequence
,
find
my
invocation
answer
by
that
delight
and
inward
satisfaction
,
with
which
I
use
when
the
present
near
prospect
be
more
remote
?
  
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
desert
in
the
hour
of
trial
,
and
that
this
my
weakness
of
mind
will
not
be
punish
with
a
spiritual
dereliction
,
for
suffer
myself
to
be
too
much
attach
to
those
worldly
delight
and
pleasure
,
which
no
mortal
ever
enjoy
in
a
more
exalted
degree
than
myself
.
<EOS>
and
I
beseech
you
,
my
dear
lady
,
let
me
be
always
remember
in
your
prayer
 
only
for
a
resignation
to
the
Divine
will
;
a
cheerful
resignation
!
<EOS>
I
presume
not
to
prescribe
to
his
gracious
Providence
;
for
if
one
have
but
that
,
one
have
every
thing
that
one
need
to
have
.
  
<EOS>
forgive
me
,
my
dear
lady
,
for
be
so
deeply
serious
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
be
contend
with
a
severe
pang
,
that
be
now
go
off
;
what
effect
its
return
may
have
,
God
only
know
.
<EOS>
and
if
this
be
the
last
line
I
shall
ever
write
,
it
will
be
the
more
satisfactory
to
me
,
as
(
with
my
humble
respect
to
my
good
Lord
Davers
,
and
my
dear
countess
,
and
pray
for
the
continuance
of
all
your
health
and
happiness
,
both
here
and
hereafter

I
be
permit
to
subscribe
myself
your
ladyship
's
oblige
sister
and
humble
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
from
Lady
Davers
to
Mr.
B.
  
my
DEAREST
brother
,
  
<EOS>
although
I
believe
it
needless
to
put
a
man
of
your
generous
spirit
in
mind
of
do
a
worthy
action
;
yet
,
as
I
do
not
know
whether
you
have
think
of
what
I
be
go
to
hint
to
you
,
I
can
not
forbear
a
line
or
two
with
regard
to
the
good
old
couple
in
Kent
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
if
,
for
our
sin
,
God
Almighty
should
take
from
us
my
incomparable
sister
(
forgive
me
,
my
dear
brother
,
but
to
intimate
what
may
be
,
although
I
hourly
pray
,
as
her
try
minute
approach
,
that
it
will
not
)
,
you
will
,
for
her
sake
,
take
care
that
her
honest
parent
have
not
the
loss
of
your
favour
,
to
deepen
the
inconsolable
one
,
they
will
have
,
in
such
a
case
,
of
the
good
of
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
sure
you
will
do
as
generously
by
them
as
ever
:
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
your
sweet
Pamela
doubt
it
not
:
yet
,
as
you
know
how
sensible
she
be
of
every
favour
<EOS>
do
them
,
it
be
the
countess
's
opinion
and
mine
,
and
Lady
Betty
be
too
,
that
you
give
her
this
assurance
,
in
some
legal
way
:
for
,
as
she
be
naturally
apprehensive
,
and
think
more
of
her
present
circumstance
,
than
,
for
your
sake
,
she
choose
to
express
to
you
,
it
will
be
like
a
cordial
to
her
dutiful
and
grateful
heart
;
and
I
do
not
know
,
if
it
will
not
contribute
,
more
than
any
one
thing
,
to
make
her
go
through
her
task
with
ease
and
safety
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
how
much
your
heart
be
wrap
up
in
the
dear
creature
:
and
you
be
a
worthy
brother
to
let
it
be
so
!
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
me
therefore
,
I
be
sure
,
for
this
my
officiousness
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
God
will
spare
her
to
us
,
because
,
although
we
may
not
be
worthy
of
such
excellence
,
yet
we
all
now
unite
so
gratefully
to
thank
him
,
for
such
a
worthy
relation
,
that
I
hope
we
shall
not
be
deprive
of
an
example
so
necessary
to
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
have
but
one
fear
,
and
that
is
,
that
,
young
as
she
be
,
she
seem
ripen
for
glory
:
she
seem
to
have
live
long
enough
for
herself
.
<EOS>
but
for
you
,
and
for
us
,
that
God
will
still
spare
her
,
shall
be
the
hourly
prayer
of
,
my
dear
worthy
brother
,
your
ever
affectionate
sister
,
  
B.
DAVERS
.
  
<EOS>
have
you
get
her
mother
with
you
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
.
<EOS>
God
give
you
a
son
and
heir
,
if
it
be
his
blessed
will
!
<EOS>
but
,
however
that
be
,
preserve
your
Pamela
to
you
!
<EOS>
for
you
never
can
have
such
another
wife
.
    
<EOS>
from
Mrs.
B.
to
Mr.
B.
  
my
DEAR
and
EVER
-
honour
MR
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
since
I
know
not
how
it
may
please
God
Almighty
to
dispose
of
me
on
the
approach
occasion
,
I
should
think
myself
inexcusable
,
not
to
find
one
or
two
select
hour
to
dedicate
to
you
,
out
of
the
very
many
,
in
the
writing
way
,
which
your
goodness
have
indulge
me
,
because
you
see
I
take
delight
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
yet
,
think
not
,
o
best
beloved
of
my
heart
!
<EOS>
that
I
have
any
boon
to
beg
,
any
favour
to
ask
,
either
for
myself
or
for
my
friend
,
or
so
much
as
the
continuance
of
your
favour
,
to
the
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
as
to
them
,
you
have
prevent
and
exceed
all
my
wish
:
<EOS>
as
to
myself
,
if
it
please
God
to
spare
me
,
I
know
I
shall
always
be
reward
beyond
my
desert
,
let
my
deserving
be
what
they
will
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
therefore
to
acknowledge
with
the
deep
sense
of
your
goodness
to
me
,
and
with
the
most
heart
-
affect
gratitude
,
that
from
the
happy
,
the
thrice
happy
hour
,
that
you
so
generously
make
me
yours
,
till
this
moment
,
you
have
not
leave
one
thing
,
on
my
own
part
,
to
wish
for
,
but
the
continuance
and
increase
of
your
felicity
,
and
that
I
may
be
still
worthy
of
the
unexampled
goodness
,
tenderness
,
and
condescension
,
wherewith
you
have
always
treat
me
.
  
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
,
my
good
beloved
master
,
friend
,
husband
,
my
first
,
my
last
,
and
only
love
!
<EOS>
believe
me
,
I
have
nothing
to
wish
for
but
your
honour
and
felicity
,
temporal
and
eternal
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
,
that
God
,
in
his
infinite
goodness
and
mercy
,
will
perfect
his
own
good
work
,
begin
in
your
dear
heart
;
and
,
whatever
may
now
happen
,
give
us
a
happy
meeting
,
never
more
to
part
from
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
then
beg
of
you
,
my
dear
protector
,
to
pardon
all
my
imperfection
and
defect
;
and
if
,
ever
since
I
have
have
the
honour
to
be
yours
,
I
have
in
look
,
or
in
word
,
or
in
deed
,
give
you
cause
to
wish
me
other
than
I
be
,
that
you
will
kindly
put
it
to
the
score
of
natural
infirmity
(
for
in
thought
or
intention
<EOS>
,
I
can
truly
boast
,
I
have
never
wilfully
err
)
.
<EOS>
Your
tenderness
,
and
generous
politeness
to
me
,
always
give
me
apprehension
,
that
I
be
not
what
you
wish
me
to
be
,
because
you
would
not
find
fault
with
me
so
often
as
I
fear
I
deserve
:
and
this
make
me
beg
of
you
to
do
,
as
I
hope
God
Almighty
will
,
pardon
all
my
involuntary
error
and
omission
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
me
say
one
word
for
my
dear
worthy
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
Her
care
and
fidelity
will
be
very
necessary
for
your
affair
,
dear
Sir
,
while
you
remain
single
,
which
I
hope
will
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
but
,
whenever
you
make
a
second
choice
,
be
pleased
to
allow
her
such
an
annuity
as
may
make
her
independent
,
and
pass
away
the
remainder
of
her
life
with
ease
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
and
this
I
the
rather
presume
to
request
,
as
my
late
honoured
lady
once
intimate
the
same
thing
to
you
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
name
what
that
may
be
,
it
would
not
be
with
the
thought
of
heighten
,
but
of
limit
rather
,
the
natural
bounty
of
your
heart
;
and
fifty
pound
a
-
year
would
be
a
rich
provision
,
in
her
opinion
,
and
will
entail
upon
you
,
dear
Sir
,
the
blessing
of
one
of
the
faithfull
and
worthy
heart
in
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
nor
will
christian
charity
permit
me
to
forget
the
once
wicked
,
but
now
penitent
Jewkes
.
<EOS>
I
understand
by
Miss
Darnford
,
that
she
beg
for
nothing
but
to
have
the
pleasure
of
die
in
your
service
,
and
by
that
mean
to
atone
for
some
small
slip
and
mistake
in
her
account
,
which
she
have
make
formerly
,
and
she
accuse
herself
;
for
she
will
have
it
,
that
Mr.
Longman
have
be
well
to
her
than
she
deserve
,
in
pass
one
account
particularly
,
to
which
he
have
,
with
too
much
reason
,
object
;
<EOS>
do
,
dear
Sir
,
if
your
future
happy
lady
have
no
great
dislike
to
the
poor
woman
,
be
pleased
to
grant
her
request
,
except
her
own
mind
should
alter
,
and
she
desire
her
dismission
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
have
to
beg
of
God
to
shower
down
his
most
precious
blessing
upon
you
,
my
dear
,
my
first
,
my
last
,
and
my
only
love
!
<EOS>
and
to
return
to
you
an
hundred
fold
,
the
benefit
which
you
have
confer
upon
me
and
mine
,
and
upon
so
many
poor
soul
,
as
you
have
bless
through
my
hand
!
<EOS>
and
that
you
may
in
your
next
choice
be
happy
with
a
lady
,
who
may
have
every
thing
I
want
;
and
who
may
love
and
honour
you
,
with
the
same
affectionate
duty
,
which
have
be
my
delight
and
my
glory
to
pay
you
:
for
in
this
I
be
sure
,
no
one
can
exceed
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
after
have
give
you
long
life
,
prosperity
,
and
increase
of
honour
,
translate
you
into
a
bless
eternity
,
where
,
through
the
merit
of
our
common
Redeemer
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
allow
a
place
,
and
be
permit
(
o
let
me
indulge
that
pleasing
,
that
consolatory
think
!
)
to
receive
and
rejoice
in
my
restored
spouse
,
for
ever
and
ever
:
be
the
prayer
,
the
last
prayer
,
if
it
so
please
God
!
<EOS>
of
,
my
dear
dear
Mr.
B.
,
your
dutiful
and
affectionate
wife
,
and
faithful
servant
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
    
from
Miss
Darnford
to
Lady
Darnford
.
  
<EOS>
my
HONOURED
mamma
,
  
You
can
not
conceive
how
you
and
my
dear
papa
have
delight
my
good
Mrs.
B.
and
oblige
her
Mr.
B.
by
the
permission
you
have
give
me
to
attend
her
till
the
important
hour
shall
be
over
with
her
;
for
she
be
exceedingly
apprehensive
,
and
one
can
hardly
blame
her
;
since
there
be
hardly
such
another
happy
couple
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
that
the
ceremony
be
over
,
so
much
to
both
your
satisfaction
:
may
this
matrimony
be
but
a
tenth
part
as
happy
as
that
I
be
witness
to
here
;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Murray
will
have
that
to
boast
of
,
which
few
married
people
have
,
even
among
those
we
call
happy
!
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
believe
I
shall
never
care
to
marry
at
all
;
for
though
I
can
not
be
so
deserving
as
Mrs.
B.
<EOS>
yet
I
shall
not
bear
to
think
of
a
husband
much
less
excellent
than
her
.
<EOS>
nay
,
by
what
I
see
in
her
apprehension
,
and
conceive
of
the
condition
she
hourly
expect
to
be
in
,
I
do
not
think
a
lady
can
be
requite
with
a
less
worthy
one
,
for
all
she
be
likely
to
suffer
on
a
husband
's
account
,
and
for
the
sake
of
his
family
and
name
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Andrews
,
a
discreet
worthy
soul
as
ever
<EOS>
I
know
,
and
who
in
her
aspect
and
behaviour
be
far
from
be
a
disgrace
even
to
Mr.
B.
's
lady
,
be
with
her
dear
daughter
,
to
her
no
small
satisfaction
,
as
you
may
suppose
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
ask
my
advice
yesterday
,
about
have
in
the
house
a
midwife
,
to
be
at
hand
,
at
a
moment
's
warning
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
fear
the
sight
of
such
a
person
would
terrify
her
:
<EOS>
and
so
he
instantly
start
an
expedient
,
of
which
her
mother
,
Mrs.
Jervis
,
and
myself
,
approve
,
and
have
put
into
practice
;
for
this
day
,
Mrs.
Harris
,
a
distant
relation
of
mine
,
though
not
of
yours
,
Sir
and
Madam
,
be
arrive
from
Essex
to
make
me
a
visit
;
and
Mr.
B.
have
prevail
upon
her
,
in
compliment
to
me
,
as
he
pretend
,
to
accept
of
her
board
in
his
house
,
while
she
stay
in
town
,
which
she
say
,
will
be
about
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harris
be
a
discreet
,
modest
,
matron
-
like
person
,
Mrs.
B.
take
a
liking
to
her
at
first
sight
,
and
be
already
very
familiar
with
her
;
and
understanding
that
she
be
a
doctor
of
physic
's
lady
,
and
take
as
much
delight
in
administer
to
the
health
of
her
own
sex
,
as
her
husband
use
to
do
to
that
of
both
,
Mrs.
B.
say
it
be
very
fortunate
,
that
she
have
so
experience
a
lady
to
consult
,
as
she
be
such
a
novice
in
her
own
case
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
however
,
to
carry
on
the
honest
imposture
the
well
,
just
now
,
in
presence
of
Mrs.
Harris
,
and
Mrs.
Andrews
,
and
me
,
ask
the
former
,
if
it
be
not
necessary
to
have
in
the
house
the
good
woman
?
<EOS>
this
fright
Mrs.
B.
who
turn
pale
,
and
say
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harris
say
it
be
highly
necessary
that
Mrs.
B.
if
she
would
not
permit
the
gentlewoman
to
be
in
the
house
,
should
see
her
;
and
that
then
,
she
apprehend
,
there
would
be
no
necessity
,
as
she
do
not
live
far
off
,
to
have
her
in
the
house
,
since
Mrs.
B.
be
so
uneasy
upon
that
account
.
<EOS>
this
please
Mrs.
B.
much
,
and
Mrs.
Thomas
be
admit
to
attend
her
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
you
must
know
,
that
this
be
the
assistant
of
my
new
relation
;
and
she
be
apprise
of
the
matter
,
come
;
but
never
do
I
see
so
much
shyness
and
apprehension
as
Mrs.
B.
shew
all
the
time
Mrs.
Thomas
be
with
her
,
hold
sometimes
her
mother
,
sometimes
Mrs.
Harris
,
by
the
hand
,
and
be
ready
to
sweat
with
terror
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Harris
scrape
acquaintance
with
Mrs.
Thomas
,
who
,
pretend
to
recollect
her
,
give
Mrs.
Harris
great
praise
;
which
increase
Mrs.
B.
's
confidence
in
her
:
<EOS>
and
she
undertake
to
govern
the
whole
so
,
that
the
dread
Mrs.
Thomas
nee
not
come
till
the
very
moment
:
which
be
no
small
pleasure
to
the
over
-
nice
lady
.
<EOS>
and
she
seem
every
hour
to
be
better
pleased
with
Mrs.
Harris
,
who
,
by
her
prudent
talk
,
will
more
and
more
familiarize
her
to
the
circumstance
,
unaware
to
herself
in
a
manner
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
this
precaution
,
of
a
midwife
in
the
house
,
Mr.
B.
intend
to
have
a
gentleman
of
the
profession
in
readiness
,
for
fear
of
the
bad
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
have
write
a
letter
,
with
this
superscription
:
"
to
the
ever
-
honoured
and
ever
-
dear
Mr.
B.
,
with
prayer
for
his
health
,
honour
,
and
prosperity
in
this
world
,
and
everlasting
felicity
in
that

come

<EOS>
P.B.

It

and
she
give
it
me
this
moment
,
on
her
be
take
ill

to
give
to
Mr.

if
she

avert
that

the
happiness
of
all
who

and
particularly
for
that

for
I
can
not

a
great
loss

I
be
sure

may
that

very
many

happy

I

Mrs.
B.
be
well
again

and
have
,
occasionally

make
some
fine
reflection
,
direct
herself
to
me
,
but
design
for
the
benefit
of
her
Polly

on
the
subject
of
the
inconsideration
of
some
of
our
sex

with
regard
to
the
circumstance
she
be

I
know
what
her
design

every

very
movingly
fall
down
by
the
door

on
her

pray
to

<EOS>
what
an
honour
be
this
to
a

<EOS>
in
my
opinion
very
far
surpass
the
mis

nomer'd
free

some

a

<EOS>
and
Mr.

and
you
can
not
conceive
how
greatly
my
Lady
Davers
be
transport
with
joy
,
to
have
a
son
and
heir
to
the
estate
<EOS>
:
she
be
every

almost
,
thank
her

sister
for
him

and
read
in
the

all
the
great
quality
she
form

'
<EOS>
Tis
indeed
a
charming
boy

and
have
a
great
deal
(
if
one
may
judge
of
a
child
so
very
young
)
of
his
father
's
manly
aspect
.
<EOS>
the
dear
lady
herself
be
still
but
weak
;
but
the
joy
of
all
around
her
,
and
her

's
tenderness
and
politeness
,
give
her
cheerful
and
free
spirit
;
and
she

<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
,
as
soon
as
the
danger
be
over
,
ask
me
for
her
letter
with
the
black
seal
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
earnest
to
get
it
from
Mr.
B.
but
to
no
purpose
;
so
I
be
force
to
tell
who
have
it
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
but
very
composedly
,
she
be
sorry
for
it
,
and
hope
he
have
not
open
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
into
her
chamber
soon
after
,
and
I
demand
it
before
her
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
design
to
ask
her
leave
to
break
the
seal
,
which
he
have
not
yet
do
;
nor
would
without
her
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
leave
,
my

"
say
he
,
"
to
break
the
seal
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
,
Sir
,
let
it
not
be
in
my
presence
;
but
it
be
too
serious
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
,
my

now
the
apprehension
be
so
happily
over

it
may
now
add
to
my

my
thankfulness
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
do
as
you
please
,
Sir
;
but
I
have
rather
you
would
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
here
it
be
,
Miss
Darnford
:
it
be
put
into
your
hand
,
and
there
I
place
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
something
like
,
"
say
I
,
"
consider
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
,
I
hope
we
shall
bring
him
into
good
order
between
us
in
time
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
return
it
to
the
dear
writer
;
who
put
it
into
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
I
relate
to
Lady
Davers
,
when
she
come
,
this
circumstance
;
and
she
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
have
leave
to
take
it
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
proud
of
all
opportunity
now
of
justify
her
brother
's
choice
,
and
do
honour
to
his
wife
,
with
Lady
Betty
C.
,
who
be
her
great
favourite
,
and
who
delight
to
read
Mrs.
B.
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
You
desire
to
know
,
my
honoured
papa
,
how
Mr.
B.
pass
his
time
,
and
whether
it
be
in
his
lady
's
chamber
?
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
catch
gentleman
,
the
good
of
them
,
in
too
great
a
complaisance
that
way
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
then
,
do
he
pass
his
time
with
you
,
Polly
?
<EOS>
"
you
be
pleased
to
ask
.
<EOS>
what
a
disadvantage
a
man
lie
under
,
who
have
be
once
a
rake
!
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
generally
with
Mrs.
B.
that
when
I
tell
you
,
Sir
,
his
visit
to
her
be
much
of
the
polite
form
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
answer
all
you
mean
by
your
question
;
and
especially
when
I
remind
you
,
Sir
,
that
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
the
Earl
and
Countess
of
C.
and
your
unworthy
daughter
,
be
at
dinner
and
supper
-
time
generally
together
;
for
Mrs.
Andrews
,
who
be
not
yet
go
back
to
Kent
,
breakfast
,
dine
,
and
sup
with
her
beloved
daughter
,
and
be
hardly
ever
out
of
her
room
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
Sir
,
Mr.
B.
,
the
Earl
,
and
Lord
Davers
,
give
pretty
constant
attendance
to
the
business
of
parliament
;
and
,
now
and
-
then
,
sup
abroad
 
<EOS>
so
,
Sir
,
we
be
all
upon
honour
;
and
I
could
wish
(
only
that
your
facetiousness
always
give
me
pleasure
,
as
it
be
a
token
that
you
have
your
much
-
desire
health
and
freedom
of
spirit
)
,
that
even
in
jest
,
my
mamma
's
daughter
may
pass
unquestione
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
know
why
you
do
it
:
it
be
only
to
put
me
out
of
heart
to
ask
to
stay
longer
.
<EOS>
yet
I
wish
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
you
will
not
permit
me
to
go
through
the
whole
winter
here
.
<EOS>
Will
my
dear
papa
grant
it
,
do
you
think
,
if
you
be
to
lay
the
high
obligation
upon
your
dutiful
daughter
,
and
petition
for
me
?
<EOS>
and
should
you
care
to
try
?
<EOS>
I
dare
not
hope
it
myself
:
but
when
one
see
a
gentleman
here
,
who
deny
his
lady
nothing
,
it
make
one
wish
,
methink
,
that
Lady
Darnford
,
be
as
happy
in
that
particular
as
Mrs.
B.
  
Your
indulgence
for
this
one
winter
,
or
,
<EOS>
rather
this
small
remainder
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
make
not
so
much
doubt
of
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
call
me
a
bold
girl
;
but
then
you
always
,
when
you
do
,
condescend
to
grant
my
request
:
and
I
will
be
as
good
as
ever
<EOS>
I
can
be
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
up
all
the
lose
time
;
rise
an
hour
sooner
in
the
morning
,
go
to
bed
an
hour
later
at
night
;
flower
<EOS>
my
papa
any
thing
he
please
<EOS>
;
read
him
to
sleep
when
he
please
;
put
his
gout
into
good
-
humour
,
when
it
will
be
soothe
 
and
Mrs.
B.
,
to
crown
all
,
will
come
down
with
me
,
by
permission
of
her
sovereign
lord
,
who
will
attend
her
,
you
may
be
sure
:
and
will
not
all
this
do
,
to
procure
me
a
month
or
two
more
?
 
<EOS>
if
it
will
not
,
why
then
,
I
will
thank
you
for
your
past
goodness
to
me
,
and
with
all
duty
and
cheerfulness
,
bid
adieu
to
this
dear
London
,
this
dearer
family
,
and
tend
a
still
dearer
papa
and
mamma
;
whose
dutiful
daughter
I
will
ever
be
,
whilst
  
POLLY
DARNFORD

<EOS>
to
the
same

<EOS>
my
HONOURED
papa
and
MAMMA
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
receive
your
joint
command
,
and
intend
to
set
out
on
Wednesday
,
next
week
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
find
my
papa
in
well
health
than
at
present
,
and
in
well
humour
too
;
for
I
be
sorry
he
be
displeased
with
my
petitioning
for
a
little
long
time
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
severe
to
impute
to
me
want
of
duty
and
affection
,
which
would
,
if
deserved
,
make
me
most
unworthy
of
your
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
and
his
lady
be
resolve
to
accompany
me
in
their
coach
,
till
your
chariot
meet
me
,
if
you
will
be
pleased
to
permit
it
so
to
do
;
and
even
set
me
down
at
your
gate
,
if
it
do
not
;
but
he
vow
,
that
he
will
neither
alight
at
your
house
,
nor
let
his
lady
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
that
this
be
a
misplaced
resentment
,
because
I
ought
to
think
it
a
favour
,
that
you
have
indulge
me
so
much
as
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
and
yet
even
this
be
likewise
a
favour
on
their
side
,
to
me
,
because
it
be
an
instance
of
their
fondness
for
your
unworthy
daughter
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
B.
be
,
if
possible
,
more
lovely
since
her
lying
-
in
than
before
.
<EOS>
She
have
so
much
delight
in
her
nursery
,
that
I
fear
it
will
take
her
off
from
her
pen
,
which
will
be
a
great
loss
to
all
whom
she
use
to
oblige
with
her
correspondence
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
new
object
of
her
care
be
a
charming
child
;
and
she
be
exceedingly
pleased
with
her
nurse
;
 
for
she
be
not
permit
,
as
she
very
much
desire
,
to
suckle
it
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
make
a
great
proficiency
in
the
french
and
italian
language
;
and
well
she
may
;
for
she
have
the
good
schoolmaster
in
the
world
,
and
one
whom
she
love
better
than
any
lady
ever
love
a
tutor
.
<EOS>
He
be
lofty
,
and
will
not
be
dispute
with
;
but
I
never
see
a
more
polite
and
tender
husband
,
for
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
splendid
christening
,
exceedingly
well
order
,
and
every
body
be
delighted
at
it
.
<EOS>
the
quality
gossip
go
away
but
on
Tuesday
;
and
my
Lady
Davers
take
leave
of
her
charming
sister
with
all
the
blessing
,
and
all
the
kindness
,
and
affectionate
fondness
,
that
could
be
express
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Andrews
,
that
worthy
old
man
,
come
up
to
see
his
grandson
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
You
would
never
have
forget
the
good
man
's
behaviour
(
have
you
see
it
)
,
to
his
daughter
,
and
to
the
charming
child
;
I
wish
I
could
describe
it
to
you
;
but
I
be
apt
to
think
Mrs.
B.
will
notice
it
to
Lady
Davers
;
and
if
she
enter
into
the
description
of
it
while
I
stay
,
I
will
beg
a
copy
of
it
,
to
bring
down
with
me
;
because
I
know
you
be
pleased
with
the
sensible
,
plain
,
good
man
,
and
his
way
,
when
at
the
Hall
in
your
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
be
name
William
,
and
I
should
have
tell
you
;
but
I
write
without
any
manner
of
connection
,
just
as
thing
come
uppermost
:
but
do
not
,
my
dear
papa
,
construe
this
,
too
,
as
an
instance
of
disrespect
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
but
one
thing
that
can
possibly
happen
to
disturb
the
felicity
of
this
charming
couple
;
and
that
I
will
mention
,
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
and
Mrs.
B.
and
myself
be
at
the
masquerade
,
before
she
lie
-
in
:
there
be
a
lady
greatly
take
with
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
She
be
in
a
nun
's
habit
,
and
follow
him
wherever
he
go
;
and
Mr.
Turner
,
a
gentleman
of
one
of
the
inn
of
court
,
who
visit
Mr.
B.
and
be
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
,
tell
me
,
by
-
the
bye
,
that
the
lady
take
an
opportunity
to
unmask
to
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
Mr.
Turner
have
since
find
she
be
the
young
Countess
Dowager
of
 
,
a
fine
lady
;
but
not
the
most
reserved
in
her
conduct
of
late
,
since
her
widowhood
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
since
discover
,
as
he
say
,
that
a
letter
or
two
,
if
not
more
,
have
pass
between
Mr.
B.
and
that
lady
.
  
<EOS>
now
Mrs.
B.
,
with
all
her
perfection
,
have
,
as
she
own
,
a
little
spice
of
jealousy
;
and
should
she
be
once
alarm
,
I
tremble
for
the
consequence
to
both
their
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
I
conceive
,
that
if
ever
anything
make
a
misunderstanding
between
them
,
it
will
be
from
some
such
quarter
as
this
.
<EOS>
but
'
tis
a
thousand
pity
it
should
.
<EOS>
and
I
hope
,
as
to
the
actual
correspondence
begin
,
Mr.
Turner
be
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
it
as
it
will
,
I
would
not
for
the
world
,
that
the
first
hint
of
this
matter
should
come
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
be
a
very
enterprising
and
gallant
man
,
a
fine
figure
,
and
I
do
not
wonder
a
lady
may
like
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
seem
so
pleased
,
so
satisfied
with
his
wife
,
and
carry
it
to
her
with
so
much
tenderness
and
affection
,
that
I
hope
her
merit
,
and
his
affection
for
her
,
will
secure
his
conjugal
fidelity
.
  
<EOS>
if
it
prove
otherwise
,
and
she
discover
it
,
I
know
not
one
that
would
be
more
miserable
than
Mrs.
B.
,
as
well
from
motive
of
piety
and
virtue
,
as
from
the
excessive
love
she
bear
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
hope
for
well
thing
,
for
both
their
sake
.
  
<EOS>
My
humble
thank
for
all
your
indulgence
to
me
,
with
hope
,
that
you
will
not
,
my
dear
papa
and
mamma
,
hold
your
displeasure
against
me
,
when
I
throw
myself
at
your
foot
,
as
I
now
soon
hope
to
do
.

We

and
then
we

We

<EOS>
,
we

<EOS>
what

upon

in
a
true
maternal
tenderness

every
step
I
move
toward
the

little
blessing

<EOS>
yet
sometimes
,
I
think
your

brother
be
not
so
fond
of
him
as
I
wish
him
to
be

<EOS>
He
say
,
"
'
tis
time
enough
for
him
to
mind
him
,
when
he
can
return
his
notice
,
and

<EOS>
a

It

<EOS>
Mr.
B.
have
just
put
into
my
hand
Mr.
Locke
's
Treatise
on
Education
,
and
he
command
me
to
give
him
my
thought
upon
it
in
writing
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
very
high
regard
for
this
author
,
and
tell
me
,
that
my
tenderness
for
Billy
will
make
me
think
some
of
the
first
advice
give
in
it
a
little
harsh
;
but
although
he
have
not
read
it
through
,
only
have
dip
into
it
here
and
there
,
he
believe
from
the
name
of
the
author
,
I
can
not
have
a
well
directory
;
and
my
opinion
of
it
,
after
I
have
well
consider
it
,
will
inform
him
,
he
say
,
of
my
own
capacity
and
prudence
,
and
how
far
he
may
rely
upon
both
in
the
point
of
a
first
education
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
,
if
I
may
not
be
excuse
write
,
only
make
my
observation
,
here
and
there
,
to
himself
,
as
I
find
occasion
?
<EOS>
but
he
say
,
"
You
will
yourself
,
my
dear
,
better
consider
the
subject
,
and
be
more
a
mistress
of
it
,
and
I
shall
the
well
attend
to
your
reasoning
,
when
put
into
writing
:
and
surely
,
Pamela
,
you
may
,
in
such
an
important
point
as
this
,
as
well
oblige
me
with
a
little
of
your
penmanship
,
as
your
other
dear
friend
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
your
ladyship
will
judge
I
have
not
another
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
cut
one
to
the
heart
,
when
he
speak
so
seriously
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
look
a
little
into
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
book
quite
accommodate
to
my
case
,
be
write
to
a
gentleman
,
the
author
's
friend
,
for
the
regulation
of
his
conduct
towards
his
child
.
<EOS>
but
how
shall
I
do
,
if
in
such
a
famed
and
renowned
author
,
I
see
already
some
few
thing
,
which
I
think
want
clear
up
.
<EOS>
will
not
it
look
like
intolerable
vanity
in
me
,
to
find
fault
with
such
a
genius
as
Mr.
Locke
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
,
on
this
occasion
,
give
your
ladyship
the
particular
of
a
short
conversation
between
your
brother
and
me
;
which
,
however
,
perhaps
,
will
not
be
to
my
advantage
,
because
it
will
shew
you
what
a
teazing
body
I
can
be
,
if
I
be
indulge
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
B.
will
not
spoil
me
neither
in
that
way
,
I
dare
say
!
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
see
this
in
the
very
dialogue
I
shall
give
you
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
read
in
Mr.
Locke
's
book

and
Mr.
B.
ask
me
how
I
like
it
?
 
<EOS>
"
exceedingly
well
,
Sir

<EOS>

I
have
a
proposal
to
make

which
,
if
you
will
be
pleased
to
comply
with
,
will
give
me
a
charming
opportunity
of

Mr.
Locke

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
proposal
,
my

?
<EOS>
I
see
it
be
some
very
particular
one

by
that
sweet
earnestness
in
your
look

"
  
<EOS>
"
why

so
it

I

whether
you

before
I
make

I

He
take
my
hand
,
and
lead
me
to
his
closet

call
me
his
pretty
impertinent
;

then
urge
me

I
say
,
"
You
know

Sir

I

fit

for
a

judge
of
any
part

education

I
can
learn
of

the
baby
conduct

now

if
I
may
take
into
the
house
some
little
Master
of
three

four
year
old

Miss

six

my
own
defect
,
and
what
I
have
wish
to
mend
,
know
how
to
judge
of
,
and
supply
that
part
of
life
which
carry
a
child
up
to
eleven
or
twelve
year
of
age
,
which
be
mine
,
when
my
lady
take
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
pretty
thought
,
Pamela
!
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
who
will
part
with
their
child
,
think
you
?
<EOS>
Would
you
,
if
it
be
your
case
,
although
ever
so
well
assure
of
the
advantage
your
little
one
would
reap
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
for
do
not
you
consider
,
that
the
child
ought
to
be
wholly
subject
to
your
authority
?
<EOS>
that
its
father
or
mother
ought
seldom
to
see
it
;
because
it
should
think
itself
absolutely
dependent
upon
you
?
 
<EOS>
and
where
,
my
dear
,
will
you
meet
with
parent
so
resign
?
 
<EOS>
besides
,
one
would
have
the
child
descend
of
genteel
parent
,
and
not
such
as
could
do
nothing
for
it
;
otherwise
the
turn
of
mind
and
education
you
would
give
it
,
may
do
it
more
harm
than
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
this
,
Sir
,
be
very
true
.
<EOS>
but
have
you
no
other
objection
,
if
one
could
find
a
genteely
-
descend
young
Master
?
<EOS>
and
would
you
join
to
persuade
his
papa
to
give
me
up
his
power
,
only
from
three
month
to
three
month
,
as
I
like
,
and
the
child
like
,
and
as
the
papa
approve
of
my
proceeding
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
so
reasonable
,
with
these
last
condition
,
Pamela
,
that
I
should
be
pleased
with
your
notion
,
if
it
could
be
put
in
practice
,
because
the
child
would
be
benefit
by
your
instruction
,
and
you
would
be
improve
in
an
art
,
which
I
could
wish
to
see
you
an
adept
in
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
have
rather
it
be
a
girl
than
a
boy
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
my
dear
,
if
a
girl
could
be
find
,
whose
parent
would
give
her
up
to
you
;
but
I
suppose
you
have
some
boy
in
your
head
,
by
your
put
it
upon
that
sex
at
first

"
  
<EOS>

let
me
see

Sir

you

you

me
see

look
boldly

what
now

with
some
little
impatience

would
the
pretty
fool

<EOS>
"
only
,
Sir
,
that
you
have
nothing
to
do

to
speak
the
word

there
be
a
child

I
be
sure

would
consent

up

have
you

half
angry

I
be
sadly
baulk

have
neither

at

I
have
put
him
into

flutter

put

what

Lamb

<EOS>
"

I

Thou

I
be
call
upon

my

benefactor

little
airing

suffer
me
only
to
conclude
this
long
letter

<EOS>
so
I
be
oblige

with
great
abruptness
than
I
have
design

to
mention
thankfully
your

kind
letter

a
certain
event
take
place

Mr.
B.
shew
it
to
me
this
morning
,
and
not
before
 
I
believe
,
for
fear
I
should
have
be
so
much
oppress
by
the
sense
of
your
unmerited
goodness
to

have
he
let
me
known
of
it

heap
favour

as
you
be
hourly
do
besides

<EOS>
what
a
happy
creature
be
I

<EOS>
but
my
gratitude
run
me
into
length
;
and
sorry
I
be
,
that
I
can
not
have
time
just
now
to
indulge
it

<EOS>
be
there
nothing

my

that
I

a
will

not
an
ungrateful

sordid
creature

<EOS>
and
yet
,
if
you
give
me
power
to
do
any
thing
that
will
have
the
appearance
of
a
return
,
even
that
power
will
be
lay
a
fresh
obligation
upon
me
 
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
I
should
be
very
proud
of
,
because
I
should
thereby
convince
you

by
more
than
word

how
much
I
be

I
hope
so
to
direct
his
early
notion

sensible

his
dutiful
obligation

<EOS>
from
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
B.
  
my
dearest
pamela
,
  
talk
not
to
us
of
unreturnable
obligation
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
You
do
more
for
us
,
in
the
entertainment
you
give
us
all
,
by
your
letter
,
than
we
have
do
,
or
even
can
do
,
for
you
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
me
,
I
know
no
great
pleasure
in
the
world
than
that
which
my
brother
's
felicity
and
yours
give
me
.
<EOS>
God
continue
this
felicity
to
you
both

<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
will
be
his
fault
,
and
not
yours
,
if
it
be
at
all
diminish
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
hear
some
idle
rumour
here
,
as
if
you
be
a
little
uneasy
of
late
;
and
have
not
have
a
letter
from
you
for
this
fortnight
past
,
it
make
me
write
,
to
ask
you
how
you
all
do
?
<EOS>
and
whether
you
expect
an
answer
from
me
to
your
last
?
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
be
punctilious
with
me
.
<EOS>
for
we
have
nothing
to
write
about
,
except
it
be
how
much
we
all
love
and
honour
you
;
and
that
you
believe
already
,
or
else
you
do
not
do
us
justice
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
be
go
out
of
town
soon
,
now
the
parliament
be
rise
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
be
resolve
to
put
his
proxy
into
another
hand
,
and
intend
I
believe
,
to
take
my
brother
's
advice
in
it
.
<EOS>
both
the
Earl
and
his
lordship
be
highly
pleased
with
my
brother
's
moderate
and
independent
principle
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
great
credit
among
all
unprejudice
man
,
by
the
part
he
act
throughout
the
last
session
,
in
which
he
have
show
,
that
he
would
no
more
join
to
distress
and
clog
the
wheel
of
government
,
by
an
unreasonable
opposition
,
than
he
would
do
the
dirty
work
of
any
administration
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
so
noble
a
fortune
and
want
nothing
of
any
body
,
he
would
be
doubly
to
blame
,
to
take
any
other
part
than
that
of
his
country
,
in
which
he
have
so
great
a
stake
.
  
<EOS>
May
he
act
out
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
house
with
equal
honour
;
and
he
will
be
his
country
's
pride
,
and
your
pride
,
and
mine
too
!

of
late
.
<EOS>
for
my
title
to
that
honour
arise
from
the
dear
,
thrice
dear
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
how
long
I
may
be
permit
to
call
him
mine
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
but
since
you
command
it
,
I
will
call
your
ladyship
by
that
beloved
name
,
let
the
rest
happen
as
God
shall
see
fit
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
can
not
be
unpolite
,
in
the
main
;
but
he
be
cold
,
and
a
little
cross
,
and
short
in
his
speech
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
hide
my
grief
from
everybody
,
and
most
from
him
:
for
neither
my
parent
,
nor
Miss
Darnford
know
anything
from
me
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
,
from
whom
I
seldom
hide
any
thing
,
as
she
be
on
the
spot
with
me
,
hear
not
my
complaining
,
nor
my
uneasiness
;
for
I
would
not
lessen
the
dear
man
.
<EOS>
He
may
yet
see
the
error
of
the
way
he
be
in
.
<EOS>
God
grant
it
,
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
even
sorry
your
ladyship
be
afflict
with
the
knowledge
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
the
unhappy
lady
(
God
forgive
her
!
)
be
to
be
pity
:
she
love
him
,
and
have
strong
passion
,
and
be
unused
to
be
control
,
be
lose
to
a
sense
of
honour
and
justice
.
 
<EOS>
from
these
wicked
masquerade
spring
all
the
unhappiness
;
my
Spaniard
be
too
amiable
,
and
meet
with
a
lady
who
be
no
Nun
,
but
in
habit
.
<EOS>
every
one
be
take
with
him
in
that
habit
,
so
suited
to
the
natural
dignity
of
his
person
!
 
<EOS>
o
these
wicked
masquerade
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
all
patience
in
appearance
,
all
uneasiness
in
reality
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
could
,
especially
in
this
most
affecting
point
,
be
such
an
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
know
not
what
it
have
cost
me
,
to
be
able
to
assume
that
character
!
<EOS>
yet
my
eye
be
swell
with
crying
,
and
look
red
,
although
I
be
always
breathe
on
my
hand
,
and
pat
them
with
it
,
and
my
warm
breath
,
to
hide
the
distress
that
will
,
from
my
overcharged
heart
,
appear
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
"
what
be
the
matter
with
the
little
fool
!
<EOS>
You
be
always
in
this
way
of
late
!
<EOS>
what
ail
you
,
Pamela
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
a
little
vapourish
,
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
angry
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
Billy
,
I
think
,
be
not
very
well
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
boy
will
spoil
your
temper
:
at
this
rate
,
what
should
be
your
joy
,
will
become
your
misfortune
.
<EOS>
do
not
receive
me
in
this
manner
,
I
charge
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
manner
.
<EOS>
Sir
?
<EOS>
I
always
receive
you
with
a
grateful
heart
!
<EOS>
if
any
thing
trouble
me
,
it
be
in
your
absence
:
but
see
,
Sir
"
<EOS>
(
then
I
try
to
smile
,
and
seem
pleased
)
,
"
I
be
all
sunshine
,
<EOS>
now
you
be
come
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
I
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
your
sunshine
of
late
be
all
through
a
cloud
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
be
the
matter
with
you
.
<EOS>
Your
temper
will
alter
,
and
then
"
  
"
It
shall
not
alter
,
Sir
 
<EOS>
it
shall
not
 
if
I
can
help
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
kiss
his
hand
;
<EOS>
that
dear
hand
,
that
,
perhaps
,
be
last
about
his
more
beloved
Countess
's
neck
 
<EOS>
distract
reflection
!
  
<EOS>
but
come
,
may
-
be
<EOS>
I
think
the
bad
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
do
!
<EOS>
for
my
apprehension
be
ever
aforehand
with
event
;
and
bad
must
be
the
case
,
if
it
be
bad
than
I
think
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
command
me
to
let
you
know
what
I
have
hear
,
and
how
I
come
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
your
ladyship
in
one
of
my
former
that
two
gentleman
bring
up
to
the
law
,
but
above
the
practice
of
it
,
though
I
doubt
,
not
above
practice
less
honourable
,
have
visit
us
on
come
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
be
often
here
since
,
Mr.
Turner
particularly
:
and
sometimes
by
himself
,
when
Mr.
B.
have
happen
to
be
out
:
and
he
it
be
,
as
I
guess
,
that
give
me
,
at
the
wicked
masquerade
,
the
advice
to
look
after
my
Musidorus
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
their
visit
,
and
his
much
less
:
for
he
seem
to
be
a
man
of
intriguing
spirit
.
<EOS>
but
about
three
week
ago
,
Mr.
B.
set
out
upon
a
party
of
pleasure
to
Oxford
,
he
come
and
pretend
great
business
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
breakfast
in
the
parlour
,
only
polly
attend
me
,
and
admit
him
,
to
drink
a
dish
of
chocolate
with
me
.
<EOS>
when
Polly
have
stept
out
,
he
tell
me
,
after
many
apology
,
that
he
have
discover
who
the
nun
be
at
the
masquerade
,
that
have
engage
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
  
I
say
it
be
very
indifferent
to
me
who
the
lady
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
reply
(
make
still
more
apology
,
and
pretend
great
reluctance
to
speak
out
)
,
that
it
be
no
less
a
lady
than
the
young
Countess
Dowager
of
 
,
a
lady
note
for
her
wit
and
beauty
,
but
of
a
gay
disposition
,
though
he
believe
not
yet
culpable
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
alarm
;
but
would
not
let
him
see
it
;
and
tell
Mr.
Turner
,
that
I
be
so
well
satisfied
in
Mr.
B.
's
affection
for
me
,
and
his
well
-
know
honour
,
that
I
could
not
think
myself
oblige
to
any
gentleman
who
should
endeavour
to
give
me
a
less
opinion
of
either
than
I
ought
to
have
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
bluntly
tell
me
,
that
the
very
party
Mr.
B.
be
upon
,
be
with
the
Countess
for
one
,
and
Lord
#
#
#
#
,
who
have
marry
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
glad
he
be
in
such
good
company
,
and
wish
him
every
pleasure
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
hope
,
he
say
,
he
may
trust
to
my
discretion
,
that
I
would
not
let
Mr.
B.
know
from
whom
I
have
the
information
:
that
,
indeed
,
his
motive
in
mention
it
be
self
-
interest
;
have
presume
to
make
some
overture
of
an
honourable
nature
to
the
Countess
,
in
his
own
behalf
;
which
have
be
reject
since
that
masquerade
night
:
and
he
hope
the
prudent
use
I
would
make
of
the
intimation
,
may
somehow
be
a
means
to
break
off
that
correspondence
,
before
it
be
attend
with
bad
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
coldly
,
though
it
sting
me
to
the
heart
,
that
I
be
fully
assure
of
Mr.
B.
's
honour
;
and
be
sorry
he
,
Mr.
Turner
,
have
so
bad
an
opinion
of
a
lady
to
whom
he
profess
so
high
a
consideration
.
<EOS>
and
rise
up
 
"
Will
you
excuse
me
,
Sir
,
that
I
can
not
attend
at
all
to
such
a
subject
as
this
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
not
:
and
so
must
withdraw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
,
Madam
,
one
word
.
"
<EOS>
He
offer
to
take
my
hand
,
but
I
would
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
swear
a
great
oath
,
that
he
have
tell
me
his
true
and
only
motive
;
that
letter
have
pass
between
the
Countess
and
Mr.
B.
,
add
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
beg
you
will
keep
it
within
your
own
breast
;
else
,
from
two
such
hasty
spirit
as
his
and
mine
,
it
may
be
attend
with
still
bad
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
never
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
enter
into
a
subject
that
be
not
proper
to
be
communicate
every
tittle
of
it
to
Mr.
B.
;
and
this
must
be
my
excuse
for
withdraw
.
"
<EOS>
and
away
I
go
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
judge
with
how
uneasy
a
heart
;
which
become
more
so
,
when
I
sit
down
to
reflect
upon
what
he
have
tell
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
resolve
to
give
it
as
little
credit
as
I
could
,
or
that
any
thing
would
come
of
it
,
till
Mr.
B.
's
own
behaviour
should
convince
me
,
to
my
affliction
,
that
I
have
some
reason
to
be
alarm
:
so
I
open
not
my
lip
about
it
,
not
even
to
Mrs.
Jervis
.
  
<EOS>
at
Mr.
B.
's
return
,
I
receive
him
in
my
usual
affectionate
and
unreserved
manner
:
and
he
behave
himself
to
me
with
his
accustomed
goodness
and
kindness
:
or
,
at
least
,
with
so
little
difference
,
that
have
not
Mr.
Turner
's
officiousness
make
me
more
watchful
,
I
should
not
have
perceive
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
next
day
a
letter
be
bring
by
a
footman
for
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
He
be
out
:
<EOS>
so
John
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
superscription
be
a
lady
's
writing
:
the
seal
,
the
Dowager
Lady
's
,
with
a
coronet
.
<EOS>
this
give
me
great
uneasiness
;
and
when
Mr.
B.
come
in
,
I
say
,
"
here
be
a
letter
for
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
;
and
from
a
lady
too
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
then
,
"
say
he
,
with
quickness
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
baulk
,
and
withdraw
.
<EOS>
for
I
see
him
turn
the
seal
about
and
about
,
as
if
he
would
see
whether
I
have
endeavour
to
look
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
need
not
to
have
be
so
afraid
;
for
I
would
not
have
do
such
a
thing
have
I
know
my
life
be
to
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
go
up
,
and
could
not
help
weep
at
his
quick
answer
;
yet
I
do
my
endeavour
to
hide
it
,
when
he
come
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
my
girl
a
little
inquisitive
upon
me
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
Sir
 
<EOS>
but
you
be
very
quick
on
your
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
'
Tis
my
temper
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
You
know
<EOS>
I
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
should
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
,
Sir
,
if
I
have
be
use
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
with
sternness
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
doubt
my
honour
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam

<EOS>
I
do
you
say
.
<EOS>
Sir

<EOS>
I

not

<EOS>
"
My
charmer
,
then
,
my
life
,
my
soul
:
will
any
of
those
do
?

and
salute
me
:

<EOS>
but
whatever
you
do
,
let
me
not
see
that
you
have
any
doubt
of
my
honour
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
the
very
mention
of
the
word

dear
Sir
,
be
a
security
to
me
;
I
want
no
other
;
I
can
not
doubt
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
speak
short
to
me
,
how
shall
I
bear
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
withdraw
,
speak
nothing
of
the
content
of
his
letter
;
as
I
dare
say
he
would
,
have
the
subject
be
such
as
he
choose
to
mention
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
alone
,
after
supper
,
I
take
the
liberty
to
ask
him
,
who
be
of
his
party
to
Oxford
?
<EOS>
He
name
the
viscountess
 
,
and
her
lord
,
Mr.
Howard
,
and
his
daughter
,
Mr.
Herbert
and
his
lady
:
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
a
partner
too

my

to
represent
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

much

<EOS>
"
why

Nay

He
watch
my
eye

the
turn
of
my
countenance

I

no

;
but
I
durst
not
say
so
,
nor
give
him
any
hint
about
my
informant
;
though
now
confirm
of
the
truth
of
what
Mr.
Turner
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
yet
I
resolve
,
if
possible
,
not
to
alter
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
but
my
frequent
weeping
,
when
by
myself
,
could
not
be
hide
as
I
wish
;
my
eye
not
keep
my
heart
's
counsel
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
give
occasion
to
some
of
the
stern
word
which
I
have
mention
above
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
he
further
say
at
this
time
be
,
with
a
negligent
,
yet
a
determined
air
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Pamela
,
do
not
be
doubtful
of
my
honour
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
much
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
but
,
one
day
or
other
I
shall
gratify
this
lady
's
curiosity
,
and
bring
her
to
pay
you
a
visit
,
and
you
shall
see
you
nee
not
be
ashamed
of
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
whenever
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
be
all
I
care
to
say
farther
;
for
I
see
he
be
upon
the
catch
,
and
look
steadfastly
upon
me
whenever
I
move
my
lip
;
and
I
be
not
a
finished
hypocrite
,
and
he
can
read
the
line
of
one
's
face
,
and
the
motion
of
one
's
heart
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sure
mine
be
a
very
uneasy
one
.
<EOS>
but
till
I
reflect
,
and
weigh
well
the
matter
,
it
be
bad
;
and
my
natural
imperfection
of
this
sort
make
me
see
a
necessity
to
be
more
watchful
over
myself
,
and
to
doubt
my
own
prudence
.
<EOS>
and
thus
I
reason
when
he
withdraw
:
  
"
here
<EOS>
,
"
think
I
,
"
I
have
have
a
great
proportion
of
happiness
without
alloy
,
fall
to
my
share
,
than
any
of
my
sex
;
and
I
ought
to
be
prepare
for
some
trial
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Tis
true
,
this
be
of
the
sore
kind
:
'
tis
bad
than
death
itself
to
me
,
who
have
an
opinion
of
the
dear
man
's
reformation
,
and
pride
myself
not
a
little
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
so
that
the
blow
be
full
upon
my
sore
place
.
'
<EOS>
tis
on
the
side
I
could
be
the
most
easily
penetrate
.
<EOS>
but
Achilles
could
be
touch
only
in
his
heel
;
and
if
he
be
to
die
by
an
enemy
's
hand
,
must
not
the
arrow
find
out
that
only
vulnerable
place
?
<EOS>
My
jealousy
be
that
place
with
me
,
as
your
ladyship
observe
;
but
it
be
seat
deeper
than
the
heel
:
it
be
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
the
barbed
dart
have
find
that
out
,
and
there
it
stick
up
to
the
very
feather
.
  
<EOS>
"
yet
,
"
think
I
,
"
I
will
take
care
,
that
I
do
not
exasperate
him
by
upbraiding
,
when
I
should
try
to
move
him
by
patience
and
forbearance
.
<EOS>
for
the
breach
of
his
duty
can
not
warrant
the
neglect
of
mine
.
<EOS>
My
business
be
to
reclaim
,
and
not
to
provoke
.
<EOS>
and
when
,
if
it
please
God
,
this
storm
shall
be
over
-
blow
,
let
me
not
,
by
my
present
behaviour
,
leave
any
room
for
heart
-
burning
;
but
,
like
a
skilful
surgeon
,
so
heal
the
wound
to
the
bottom
,
though
the
operation
be
painful
,
that
it
may
not
fester
,
and
break
out
again
with
fresh
violence
,
on
future
misunderstanding
,
if
any
shall
happen
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
"
think
I
,
"
let
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
he
perhaps
may
be
so
good
as
to
permit
me
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
day
with
my
dear
Billy
,
in
Kent
,
with
my
father
and
mother
;
and
so
,
when
I
can
not
rejoice
in
possession
of
a
virtuous
husband
,
I
shall
be
employ
in
pray
for
him
,
and
enjoy
a
two
-
fold
happiness
,
that
of
do
my
own
duty
to
my
dear
baby
 
a
pleasing
entertainment
this
!
<EOS>
and
that
of
comfort
my
worthy
parent
,
and
be
comfort
by
them
 
a
no
small
consolation
!
<EOS>
and
who
know
,
but
I
may
be
permit
to
steal
a
visit
now
-
and
-
then
to
dear
Lady
Davers
,
and
be
call
Sister
,
and
be
deem
a
faultless
sister
too
?
"
<EOS>
but
remember
,
my
dear
lady
,
that
if
ever
it
come
to
this
,
I
will
not
bear
,
that
,
for
my
sake
,
you
shall
,
with
too
much
asperity
,
blame
your
brother
;
for
I
will
be
ingenious
to
find
excuse
or
extenuation
for
him
;
and
I
will
now
-
and
-
then
,
in
some
disguised
habit
,
steal
the
pleasure
of
see
him
and
his
happy
Countess
;
and
give
him
,
with
a
silent
tear
,
my
blessing
for
the
good
<EOS>
I
and
mine
have
reap
at
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
but
<EOS>
oh
!
if
he
take
from
me
my
Billy
,
who
must
,
after
all
,
be
his
heir
,
and
give
him
to
the
cruel
Countess
,
he
will
at
once
burst
asunder
the
string
of
my
heart
!
<EOS>
for
,
oh
,
my
happy
rivaless
!
<EOS>
if
you
tear
from
me
my
husband
,
he
be
in
his
own
disposal
,
and
I
can
not
help
it
:
nor
can
I
indeed
,
if
he
will
give
you
my
Billy
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
be
sure
of
,
that
my
child
and
my
life
must
go
together
!
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
will
think
I
rave
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
almost
craze
at
time
.
<EOS>
for
the
dear
man
be
so
negligent
,
<EOS>
so
cold
,
so
haughty
,
that
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
just
now
,
"
You
be
quite
alter
,
Pamela
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
be
.
<EOS>
Madam
.
<EOS>
but
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
He
know
not
that
I
know
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
tell
him
.
<EOS>
for
he
will
have
me
then
reveal
my
intelligencer
:
and
what
may
be
the
case
between
them
?
  
<EOS>
I
weep
in
the
night
,
when
he
be
asleep
;
and
in
the
day
when
he
be
absent
:
and
I
be
happy
when
I
can
,
unobserved
,
steal
this
poor
relief
.
<EOS>
I
believe
already
I
have
shed
as
many
tear
as
would
drown
my
baby
.
<EOS>
how
many
more
I
may
have
to
shed
,
God
only
know
!
<EOS>
for
,
o
Madam
,
after
all
my
fortitude
,
and
my
recollection
,
to
fall
from
so
much
happiness
,
and
so
soon
,
be
a
try
thing
!
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
still
hope
the
good
,
and
should
this
matter
blow
over
,
I
shall
be
ashamed
of
my
weakness
,
and
the
trouble
I
must
give
to
your
generous
heart
,
for
one
so
undeservedly
favour
by
you
,
as
your
oblige
sister
,
and
most
humble
servant
,
P.B.
  
Dear
Madam
,
let
no
soul
see
any
part
of
this
our
present
correspondence
,
for
your
brother
's
sake
,
and
your
sake
,
and
my
sake
.
    
<EOS>
my
dearest
pamela
,
  
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
of
any
body
's
know
what
pass
between
us
on
this
cut
subject
.
<EOS>
though
I
hear
of
it
from
every
mouth
,
yet
I
pretend
'
tis
all
falsehood
and
malice
.
<EOS>
yet
Lady
Betty
will
have
it
that
there
be
more
in
it
than
I
will
own
;
and
that
I
know
my
brother
's
wickedness
by
my
pensive
look
.
<EOS>
She
will
make
a
vow
,
she
say
,
never
to
marry
any
man
live
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
move
by
your
affect
period
.
<EOS>
Charming
Pamela
!
<EOS>
what
a
tempest
<EOS>
do
you
raise
in
one
's
mind
,
when
you
please
,
and
lie
it
too
,
at
your
own
will
!
<EOS>
Your
colouring
be
strong
;
but
,
I
hope
,
your
imagination
carry
you
much
farther
than
it
be
possible
<EOS>
he
should
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
with
your
prudent
reasoning
,
and
your
wise
resolution
.
<EOS>
I
see
nobody
can
advise
or
help
you
.
<EOS>
God
only
can
!
<EOS>
and
his
direction
you
beg
so
hourly
,
that
I
make
no
doubt
you
will
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
what
vex
me
be
,
that
when
the
noble
uncle
of
this
vile
lady
(
why
do
not
you
call
her
so
as
well
as
I
?
)
 
expostulate
with
her
on
the
scandal
she
bring
upon
her
character
and
family
,
she
pretend
to
argue
(
foolish
creature
!
)
<EOS>
to
polygamy
:
and
say
,
she
have
rather
be
a
certain
gentleman
's
second
wife
,
than
the
first
to
the
great
man
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
your
own
working
;
but
if
I
find
your
prudence
unrewarde
by
the
wretch
,
the
storm
you
see
raise
at
the
Hall
,
shall
be
nothing
to
the
hurricane
I
will
excite
,
to
tear
up
by
the
root
all
the
happiness
the
two
wretch
propose
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
let
my
intelligence
,
which
be
undoubted
,
grieve
you
over
-
much
.
<EOS>
try
some
way
to
move
the
wretch
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
do
by
touch
his
generosity
:
he
have
that
in
some
perfection
.
<EOS>
but
how
in
this
case
to
move
it
,
be
beyond
my
power
or
skill
to
prescribe
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
Pamela
!
<EOS>
You
shall
be
my
only
sister
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
never
own
my
brother
,
if
he
be
so
base
to
your
superlative
merit
.
<EOS>
adieu
once
more
,
from
your
sister
and
friend
,
B.
DAVERS
.
    
<EOS>
my
DEAREST
lady
,
  
a
thousand
thank
for

<EOS>
here
I
be
force
to
leave

.
  
<EOS>
let
me
scratch
through
this
last
surmise
.
<EOS>
It
seem

him
.
<EOS>

be
some
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
He

very
kind
:
and
Billy

be
well
when
he

in
,
my
grief
pass
off
without
blame
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
many
tender
thing
to
me
;
but
add
,
that
if
I
give
myself
so
much
uneasiness
every
time
the
child
ail
any
thing
,
he
would
hire
the
nurse
to
overlay
him
.
<EOS>
bless
me
.
<EOS>
Madam
!
<EOS>
what
hard
-
hearted
shocking
thing
be
these
man
capable
of
say
!
 
<EOS>
the
farth
from
their
heart
,
indeed
<EOS>
;
so
they
have
nee
 
<EOS>
for
he
be
as
glad
of
the
child
's
be
well
as
I
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning

in
the

for
about
an
hour
,
and
return
in
a
good
humour
,
say
twenty
agreeable

,
which

me
so
proud
,
and
so
pleased
!
  
<EOS>
He

again
.
  
<EOS>
Could
I
but
find
this
matter
happily
conquer
,
for
his
own
soul
's
sake
!
 
<EOS>
but
he
seem
,
by
what
your
ladyship
mention
,
to
have
carry
this
polygamy
point
with
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Can
I
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
Madam
 
ought
I
 
if
this
be
the
case
?
<EOS>
I
have
it
under
his
hand
,
that
the
law
of
his
country
be
sufficient
to
deter
him
from
that
practice
.
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
he
know
not
this
countess
then
!
  
<EOS>
but
here
I
must
break
off
.
  
<EOS>
He

,
and
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
go

for
the
present
,
o
letter
dedicate
to

"
 
<EOS>
here

come
!
  
<EOS>
o

and

and

very
afternoon
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
all
confusion
when
he
tell
me
this
.
<EOS>
I
look
around
and
around
,
and
upon
every
thing
but
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
not
my
friend
be
welcome
,
Pamela
?
"
say
he
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
o

<EOS>
but
I
have
these
wretched
vapour
so
,
that
I
wish
I
may
be
excuse
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
be
allow
to
take
an
airing
in
the
chariot
for
two
or
three
hour
;
for
I
shall
not
be
fit
to
be
see
by
such
 
lady
,
"
say
I
,
half
out
of
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
fit
to
be
see
by
nobody
,
my
dear
,
if
you
go
on
thus
.
<EOS>
but
,
do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
go
,
and
I
take
his
hand
:
"
stay
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
let
me
know
what
you
would
have
me
do

<EOS>
if
you
would
have
me
stay
,
I
will

"
  
"
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Sir
,
then
I
will
.
<EOS>
for
it
be
hard
,
"
think
I
,
"
if
an
innocent
person
can
not
look
up
in
her
own
house
too
,
as
it
now
be
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
a
guilty
one
!
<EOS>
guilty
in
her
heart
,
at
least
!
 
<EOS>
though
,
poor
lady
,
I
hope
she
be
not
so
in
fact
;
and
,
if
God
hear
my
prayer
,
never
will
,
for
all
three
of
our
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
Madam
,
think
of
me
,
<EOS>
what
a
task
I
have
!
 
<EOS>
how
my
heart
throb
in
my
bosom
!
<EOS>
how
I
tremble
!
<EOS>
how
I
struggle
with
myself
!
<EOS>
what
rule
I
form
for
my
behaviour
to
this
naughty
lady
!
<EOS>
how
they
be
dash
in
piece
as
soon
as
form
,
and
new
one
take
up
!
<EOS>
and
yet
I
doubt
myself
when
I
come
to
the
test
.
  
<EOS>
but
one
thing
will
help
me
.
<EOS>
I
pity
the
poor
lady
;
and
as
she
come
with
the
heart
of
a
robber
,
to
invade
me
in
my
lawful
right
,
I
pride
myself
in
a
superiority
over
this
countess
;
and
will
endeavour
to
shew
her
the
country
girl
in
a
light
which
would
better
become
her
to
appear
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
be
force
to
leave
off
here
;
for
Mr.
B.
be
just
come
in
to
receive
his
guest
;
and
I
be
in
a
sad
flutter
upon
it
.
<EOS>
all
my
resolution
fail
me
;
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
o
that
this
countess
be
come
and
go
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
one
comfort
,
however
,
in
the
midst
of
all
my
griefs
;
and
that
be
in
your
ladyship
's
goodness
,
which
give
me
leave
to
assume
the
honoured
title
<EOS>
,
that
let
what
may
happen
,
will
always
give
me
equal
pride
and
pleasure
,
in
subscribe
myself

your

's
most
oblige
sister
,
and
humble
servant

P.B.
    
my
dear
lady
,
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
pursue
my
last
affect
subject
;
for
the
visit
be
over
;
but
a
sad
situation
I
be
in
with
Mr.
B.
for
all
that
:
but
,
bad
as
it
be
,
I
will
try
to
forget
it
,
till
I
come
to
it
in
course
.
  
<EOS>
at
four
in
the
afternoon
Mr.
B.
come
in
to
receive
his
guest
,
whom
he
expect
at
five
.
<EOS>
He
come
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
close
my
last
letter
;
but
put
it
up
,
and
set
before
me
your
ladyship
's
play
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
may
guess
,
by
what
I
write
before
,
that
I
could
not
give
any
extraordinary
account
of
myself
 
"
<EOS>
as
well
 
<EOS>
as
well
,
Sir
,
as
possible
;
"
half
out
of
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
give
yourself
strange
melancholy
air
of
late
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
all
that
cheerfulness
,
which
use
to
delight
me
whenever
I
see
you
<EOS>
,
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
be
quite
vanish
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
must
shortly
have
a
little
serious
talk
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
you
please
.
<EOS>
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
only
be
use
to
this
smoky
thick
air
of
London
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
well
when
you
carry
me
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
shall
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
be
in
London
so
long
before
,
you
know
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
in
good
time
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
but
be
this
the
good
appearance
you
choose
to
make
,
to
receive
such
guest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
displease
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
will
dress
otherwise
in
a
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
well
in
any
thing
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
would
have
be
better
dress
.
<EOS>
yet
it
would
never
have
<EOS>
less
become
you
;
for
of
late
your
eye
have
lose
that
brilliancy
that
use
to
strike
me
with
a
lustre
,
much
surpass
that
of
the
fine
diamond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
never
could
pride
myself
in
deserve
such
a
kind
of
compliment
,
I
should
be
too
happy
,
forgive
me
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
if
the
failure
be
not
rather
in
your
eye
,
than
in
mine

<EOS>
He
look
at
me
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
Pamela
 
but
do
not
be
a
fool

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
angry
with
me

Sir

"
no

<EOS>
Would
you

me
dress
better

"
no

not
I.

your

look
a
little
more
brilliant

you
want
no
addition

<EOS>
"
down
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
strange
short
speech
,
these
,
my
lady
,
to
what
you
have
hear
from
his
dear
mouth
!
 
<EOS>
"
yet
they
shall
not
rob
me
of
the
merit
of
a
patient
sufferer
,
I
be
resolve

"
think
i.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
lady
,
as
I
doubt
not
my
rival
would
come
adorn
with
every
outward
ornament
,
I
put
on
only
a
white
damask
gown
,
have
no
desire
to
vie
with
her
in
appearance
;
for
a
virtuous
and
honest
heart
be
my
glory
,
I
bless
God
!
<EOS>
I
wish
the
countess
have
the
same
to
boast
of
!
  
<EOS>
about
five
,
their
ladyship
come
in
the
countess
's
new
chariot
:
for
she
have
not
be
long
out
of
her
transitory
mourning
,
and
dress
as
rich
as
jewel
,
and
a
profusion
of
expense
,
could
make
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
them
from
the
window
alight
.
<EOS>
o
how
my
heart
throb
!
 
<EOS>
"
lie
still
,
"
say
I
,
"
busy
thing
!
<EOS>
why
all
this
emotion
?
 
<EOS>
those
shine
ornament
cover
not
such
a
guileless
flatterer
as
thou
.
<EOS>
why
then
all
this
emotion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
polly
Barlow
come
up
instantly
from
Mr.
B.
  
I
hasten
down
;
tremble
,
tremble
,
tremble
,
go
my
foot
,
in
spite
of
all
the
resolution
I
have
be
endeavour
so
long
to
collect
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
present
the
countess
to
me
,
both
of
us
cover
with
blush
;
but
from
very
different
motive
,
as
I
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Countess
of
 
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
salute
me
,
and
look
,
as
I
think
,
half
with
envy
,
half
with
shame
:
but
one
be
apt
to
form
people
's
countenance
by
what
one
judge
of
their
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
too
lovely
,
too
charming
rival
!
"
<EOS>
think
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
"
Would
to
heaven
<EOS>
I
see
less
attraction
in
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
for
indeed
she
be
a
charming
lady
;
yet
she
could
not
help
call
me
Mrs.
B.
<EOS>
,
that
be
some
pride
to
me
:
every
little
distinction
be
a
pride
to
me
now
 
and
say
,
she
hope
I
would
excuse
the
liberty
she
have
take
:
<EOS>
but
the
character
give
of
me
by
Mr.
B.
make
her
desirous
of
pay
her
respect
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
these
villainous
masquerade
,
"
think
I
!
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
never
have
want
to
see
me
,
but
for
them
,
poor
naughty
<EOS>
Nun
,
that
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
present
also
the
viscountess
to
me
;
I
salute
her
ladyship
;
her
sister
salute
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
graceful
lady
;
well
,
as
I
hope
,
in
heart
,
but
not
equal
in
person
to
her
sister

<EOS>
"
You
have
a
charming
boy

I
be
tell
,
Madam
;

no
wonder
from
such
a
pair

"
<EOS>
o
dear
heart
<EOS>
,
"
think
I
,
"
i'n't
it
so
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
may
guess
what
I
think
farther
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
your
ladyship
see
him
now
?
"
say
Mr.
B.
  
He
do
not
look
down
;
no
,
not
one
bit
!
 
<EOS>
though
the
Countess
play
with
her
fan
,
and
look
at
him
,
and
at
me
,
and
then
down
by
turn
,
a
little
consciously
:
while
I
wrap
up
myself
in
my
innocence
,
my
first
flutter
be
over
,
and
think
I
be
superior
,
by
reason
of
that
,
even
to
a
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
her
heart
,
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
I
ring
.
<EOS>
"
polly
,
bid
nurse
bring
my
Billy
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
,
say
I
,
with
an
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
I
meet
the
nurse
at
the
stairs
'
foot
,
and
bring
in
my
dear
baby
in
my
arm
:
"
such
a
child
,
and
such
a
mamma
!
"
say
the
Viscountess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
Master
to
my
arm
,
one
moment
,
Madam
?
"
say
the
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
think
I
,
"
much
rather
than
<EOS>
my
dear
naughty
gentleman
should
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
yield
,
it
to
her
:
I
think
she
would
have
stifle
it
with
her
warm
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
sweet
boy
I
charm
creature
,
"
and
press
it
to
her
too
lovely
bosom
,
with
such
emotion
,
look
on
the
child
,
and
on
Mr.
B.
,
that
I
like
it
not
by
any
mean
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
,
you
naughty
lady
,
"
think
I
:
<EOS>
but
I
durst
not
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
and
go
,
naughty
man
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
think
I
:
"
for
you
seem
to
look
too
much
gratified
in
your
pride
,
by
her
fondness
for
your
boy
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
do
not
love
you
so
well
as
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
but
neither
,
your
ladyship
may
believe
,
do
I
say
this
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
look
at
me
,
but
with
a
bravery
,
I
think
,
too
like
what
I
have
be
witness
to
,
in
some
former
scene
,
in
as
bad
a
cause
.
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
think
I
,
"
God
deliver
me
then
;
I
will
confide
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
now
,
I
doubt
not
,
restore
thy
heart
to
my
prayer
;
untainted
,
I
hope
,
for
thy
own
dear
sake
as
well
as
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Viscountess
take
the
child
from
her
sister
,
and
kiss
him
with
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
married
lady
.
<EOS>
Would
to
God
,
the
Countess
be
so
too
!
<EOS>
for
Mr.
B.
never
correspond
,
as
I
tell
your
ladyship
once
,
with
married
lady
:
<EOS>
so
I
be
not
afraid
of
her
love
to
my
Billy
.
<EOS>
"
but
let
me
,
"
say
she
,
"
have
the
pleasure
of
restore
Master
to
his
charming
mamma
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
"
add
she
,
"
I
never
see
a
lovelier
sight
in
my
life
,
than
when
in
his
mamma
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
can
not
say
,
"
say
the
Countess
,
"
but
Master
and
his
mamma
do
credit
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
dear
Madam
,
let
us
have
the
pleasure
of
see
him
still
on
your
lap
,
while
he
be
so
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
the
dear
baby
be
so
quiet
;
though
,
indeed
,
he
be
generally
so
:
but
he
may
surely
,
if
but
by
sympathy
,
have
complain
for
his
poor
mamma
,
though
she
durst
not
for
herself
.
  
<EOS>
how
apt
one
be
to
engage
every
thing
in
one
's
distress
,
when
it
be
deep
!
<EOS>
and
one
wonder
too
,
that
thing
animate
and
inanimate
look
with
the
same
face
,
when
we
be
greatly
move
by
any
extraordinary
and
interesting
event
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
down
with
my
baby
on
my
lap
,
look
,
I
believe
,
with
a
righteous
boldness
<EOS>
(
I
will
call
it
so
;
for
well
say
the
text
,
"
the
righteous
be
as
bold
as
a
lion
,
"
)
<EOS>
now
on
my
Billy
,
now
on
his
papa
,
and
now
on
the
Countess
,
with
such
a
triumph
in
my
heart
;
for
I
see
her
blush
,
and
look
down
,
and
the
dear
gentleman
seem
to
eye
me
with
a
kind
of
conscious
tenderness
,
as
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
a
silence
of
five
minute
,
I
believe
,
succeed
,
we
all
four
look
upon
one
another
;
and
the
little
dear
be
awake
,
and
stare
full
upon
me
,
with
such
innocent
smile
,
as
if
he
promise
to
love
me
,
and
make
me
amend
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
kiss
him
,
and
take
his
pretty
little
hand
in
mine
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
good
,
my
charmer
,
in
this
company
!
"
say
I.
  
I
remember
a
scene
,
which
make
greatly
for
me
in
the
paper
you
have
see
,
when
,
instead
of
recriminate
,
as
I
may
have
do
,
before
Mr.
Longman
for
harsh
usage
(
for
,
o
my
lady
,
your
dear
brother
have
a
hard
heart
indeed
when
he
please
)
,
I
only
pray
for
him
on
my
knee
.
  
<EOS>
and
I
hope
I
be
not
now
too
mean
;
for
I
have
dignity
and
a
proud
superiority
in
my
vain
heart
,
over
them
all
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
not
my
part
to
be
upon
defiance
,
where
I
love
,
and
where
I
hope
to
reclaim
.
<EOS>
besides
,
what
have
I
do
by
that
,
but
justified
,
seemingly
,
by
after
act
in
a
passionate
resentment
,
to
their
mind
,
at
least
,
their
too
wicked
treatment
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
your
ladyship
will
remember
,
that
Mr.
B.
know
not
that
I
be
acquaint
with
his
intrigue
:
for
I
must
call
it
so
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
,
he
be
too
noble
to
insult
me
by
such
a
visit
;
and
he
have
tell
me
,
I
should
see
the
lady
he
be
at
Oxford
with
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
,
break
silence
,
he
mention
;
<EOS>
say
,
"
I
give
you
hope
,
my
dear
,
that
I
should
procure
you
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
a
lady
who
put
herself
under
my
care
at
Oxford
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
bow
my
head
to
the
Countess
;
but
my
tear
be
ready
to
start
<EOS>
,
I
kiss
my
Billy
:
"
dearest
baby
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
be
not
go
to
cry
,
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
have
him
just
then
to
cry
,
instead
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
tea
equipage
be
bring
in
.
"
<EOS>
polly
,
carry
the
child
to
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
it
another
kiss
,
and
the
Countess
desire
another
.
<EOS>
I
grudge
it
,
to
think
her
naughty
lip
should
so
closely
follow
mine
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
kiss
it
also
,
and
carry
him
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
"
take
him
away
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
owe
him
my
blessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
these
young
gentleman
papas
!
"
say
the
Countess
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
like
young
unbroken
horse
,
just
put
into

Matrimony

doubt

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
after
tea
,
at
which
I
be
far
from
be
talkative
(
for
I
could
not
tell
what
to
say
,
though
I
try
,
as
much
as
I
could
not
to
appear
sullen
)
,
desire
the
Countess
to
play
one
tune
upon
the
harpsichord
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
,
and
sing
,
at
his
request
,
<EOS>
an
italian
song
to
it
very
prettily
;
too
prettily
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
find
some
fault
,
some
great
fault
in
her
:
but
,
o
Madam
,
she
have
too
many
outward
excellency
!
 
<EOS>
pity
she
want
a
good
heart
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
ask
nothing
,
that
she
be
not
ready
to
oblige
him
;
indeed
he
could
not
.
  
<EOS>
She
desire
me
to
touch
the
key
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
be
excuse
;
but
could
not
.
<EOS>
and
the
lady
commend
my
performance
;
but
neither
my
heart
to
play
,
nor
my
finger
in
play
,
deserve
their
praise
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
say
,
indeed
 
"
You
play
well
sometimes
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
i
,
Sir

"
be
all
the
answer
I
make
.
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
hope
,
she
say
,
I
would
return
her
visit
;
and
so
say
the
Viscountess
.
  
<EOS>
I
reply
,
Mr.
B.
would
command
me
whenever
he
please
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
hope
to
be
better
acquaint
(
"
I
hope
not

"
think
I
)
 
<EOS>
and
that
I
would
give
her
my
company
,
for
a
week
or
so
,
upon
the
Forest

:
it
seem
she
have
a
seat
upon
Windsor
Forest

<EOS>
"
Mr.

,
"
add
she
,
"
you

a

how
come
Mr.

I

<EOS>
indeed
,
my
lady

this
may
be
too
true
;
for
she
may
know
what
be
to
become
of
me

<EOS>
I
tell
her

I
be
very
much
oblige

that
Mr.

then
,

I

not

<EOS>

I

not

dispose
to

week

you
never

I
believe
,
Sir

"
interrupt
I
,
"
what
with
my
little
nursery
,
and
one
thing

another

I
must
deny

that
honour

well

bow
my

Mr.

something

Pamela
be
in
what
he
say
:
<EOS>
she
answer
him
with
a
downcast
look
,
in
the

language
,
half
-
pleased
,
half
-
serious
,
and
the
chariot
drive
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
,
"
say
I
,
"
a
good
deal

to
know
what
her

say
to

she
look
with
so
particular
a
meaning
,
if
I
may
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
truly
,

Pamela

I
say
to
her
,
"
well

now
your
ladyship
have
see
my
Pamela
 
be
she
not
the
charming
girl
in

world

"
  
<EOS>
"
She
answer
"
Mrs.
B.

very
grave
,
for
so
young
a
lady
;
but
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
she
be
a
lovely
creature

"
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
do
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
Sir

do
her

so

<EOS>
and
my
heart
be
ready

leap
out
of
my
bosom
for
joy
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
folly
spoil
all
again
;
for
,
to
my
own
surprise
,
and
great
regret
,
I
burst
out
into
tear
;
though
I
even
sob
to
have
suppress
them
,
but
could
not
;
and
so
I
lose
a
fine
opportunity
to
have
talk
to
him
while
he
be
so
kind
;
for
he
be
more
angry
with
me
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
what
make
me
such
a
fool
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
but
I
have
so
long
struggle
with
myself
;
and
not
expect
so
kind
a
question
from
the
dear
gentleman
,
or
such
a
favourable
answer
from
the
Countess
,
I
have
no
longer
any
command
of
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
ail
the
little
fool
?
"
say
he
,
with
a
wrathful
countenance
.
<EOS>
this
make
me
bad
,
and
he
add
,
"
take
care
,
take
care
,
Pamela
!
 
<EOS>
You
will
drive
me
from
you
,
in
spite
of
my
own
heart

"
  
<EOS>
so
he
go
into
the
good
parlour
,
and
put
on
his
sword
,
and
take
his
hat
.
<EOS>
I
follow
him
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
with
my
arm
expand
,
be
all
I
could
say
;
but
he
avoid
me
,
put
on
his
hat
with
an
air
;
and
out
he
go
,
bid
Abraham
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
dilemma
into
which
,
as
I
hint
at
the
beginning
of
this
letter
,
I
have
bring
myself
with
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
how
strong
,
how
prevalent
be
the
passion
of
jealousy
;
and
thus
it
will
shew
itself
uppermost
,
when
it
be
uppermost
,
in
spite
of
one
's
most
watchful
regard
!
  
<EOS>
My
mind
be
so
perplexed
,
that
I
must
lay
down
my
pen
:
and
,
indeed
,
your
ladyship
will
wonder
,
<EOS>
all
thing
consider
,
that
I
could
write
the
above
account
as
I
have
do
,
in
this
cruel
suspense
,
and
with
such
apprehension
.
<EOS>
but
writing
be
all
the
diversion
I
have
,
when
my
mind
be
oppress
.
  
<EOS>
past
TEN
<EOS>
o'clock
AT
NIGHT
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
time
to
tell
your
ladyship
(
for
the
postman
wait
)
that
Mr.
B.
be
just
come
in
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
into
his
closet
,
and
have
shut
the
door
,
and
take
the
key
on
the
inside
;
so
I
dare
not
go
to
him
there
.
<EOS>
in
this
uncertainty
and
suspense
,
pity
and
pray
for
your
ladyship
's
afflict
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
my
dear
lady
,
  
I
will
now
proceed
with
my
melancholy
account
.
<EOS>
not
know
what
to
do
,
and
Mr.
B.
not
come
near
me
,
and
the
clock
striking
twelve
,
I
venture
to
send
this
billet
to
him

by
Polly

<EOS>
"
dear
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
choose
not
to
be
invade
,
when
retire
to
your
closet
;
yet
,
be
very
uneasy
,
on
account
of
your
abrupt
departure
,
and
heavy
displeasure
,
I
take
the
liberty
to
write
these
few
line
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
,
Sir
,
that
the
sudden
flow
of
tear
which
involuntarily
burst
from
me
,
at
your
kind
expression
to
the
Countess
in
my
favour
,
when
I
have
think
for
more
than
a
month
past
,
you
be
angry
with
me
,
and
which
have
distress
my
weak
mind
beyond
expression
,
may
appear
unaccountable
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
have
you
kindly
wait
but
one
moment
till
this
fit
,
which
be
rather
owe
to
my
gratitude
than
to
perverseness
,
have
be
over
(
<EOS>
and
I
know
the
time
when
you
would
have
generously
soothe
it
)
,
I
should
have
have
the
happiness
of
a
more
serene
and
favourable
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
suffer
me
,
Sir
,
to
attend
you
?
<EOS>
(
polly
shall
wait
your
answer
)
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
come
without
your
permission
;
for
should
you
be
as
angry
as
you
be
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
how
I
shall
bear
it
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
say
I
may
come
down
,
I
hope
to
satisfy
you
,
that
I
intend
not
any
offence
.
<EOS>
do
,
dear
Sir

permit
me
to
attend
you

I
can
say
no
more

that
I

dutiful

P.B.

Polly
return
with
the
following
.
"
<EOS>
so
,
"
think
I
,
"
a
letter
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
spare
that
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
I
expect
no
favour
from
it
.
<EOS>
so
tremblingly
,
open
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
my
DEAR
,
  
"
I
would
not
have
you
sit
up
for
me

<EOS>
We
be
get
apace
into
the
matrimonial
recrimination
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
time
!
 
<EOS>
so
do
I
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
that
the
time
be
over
with
both
;
and
I
have
have
the
mortification
,
for
some
past
week
,
to
come
home
to
a
very
different
Pamela
,
than
I
use
to
leave
all
company
and
all
pleasure
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
better
understand
one
another
.
<EOS>
but
you
can
not
see
me
at
present
with
any
advantage
to
yourself
;
and
I
would
not
,
that
any
thing
farther
should
pass
,
to
add
to
the
regret
of
both
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
rest
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
your
cause
a
fair
hearing
,
when
I
be
more
fit
to
hear
all
your
plea
,
and
your
excuse
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
insensible
,
that
the
reason
for
the
concern
you
have
lately
shew
,
must
lie
deeper
than
,
perhaps
,
you
will
now
own
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
you
be
prepared
to
speak
all
that
be
upon
your
mind
,
and
I
to
hear
it
with
temper
,
then
we
may
come
to
an
eclaircissement
.
<EOS>
till
when
I
be
your
affectionate
,

"
  
<EOS>
My
busy
apprehension
immediately
suggest
to
me
,
that
I
be
to
be
terrify
,
with
a
high
hand
,
into
a
compliance
with
some
new
scheme
or
other
that
be
project
;
and
it
be
near
one
,
and
hear
nothing
from
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
,
I
bid
Polly
<EOS>
go
to
bed
,
think
she
would
wonder
at
our
intercourse
by
letter
,
if
I
should
send
again
.
  
<EOS>
so
down
I
venture
,
my
foot
,
however
,
tremble
all
the
way
,
and
tap
at
the
door
of
his
closet
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
that

<EOS>
"
I
,

one
word

not

more
angry

<EOS>
He
open
the
door
:

thus
poor
Hester

to
her
royal
husband

her
life

take
my

I

let
me
have
my
trial

that
you
write
about

<EOS>
appoint
my
day
of
hearing
,

speedily
too

I
would
not

such
another

let
us
wave
the
subject
for

out

<EOS>
I
intend
(
for
my
heart
be
full
)
to
enter
further
into
this
subject
,
so
fatal
to
my
repose
:
but
the
dear
gentleman
have
no
sooner
lay
his
head
on
the
pillow
,
but
he
fall
asleep
,
or
feign
to
do
so
,
and
that
be
as
prohibitory
to
my
talking
as
if
he
have
.
<EOS>
so
I
have
all
my
own
entertaining
reflection
to
myself
;
which
give
me
not
one
wink
of
sleep
;
but
make
me
of
so
much
service
,
as
to
tell
him
,
when
the
clock
strike
four
,
that
he
should
not
(
though
I
do
not
say
so
<EOS>
,
you
may
think
,
Madam
)
make
my
ready
rivaless
(
for
I
doubt
not
her
be
one
of
the
party
)
wait
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
arise
,
and
be
dress
instantly
;
and
salute
me
,
bid
me
be
easy
and
happy
,
while
it
be
yet
in
my
own
power
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
should
be
back
on
Saturday
night
,
as
he
believe
.
<EOS>
and
I
wish
him
,
most
fervently
,
I
be
sure
,
health
,
pleasure
,
and
safety
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
Madam
,
must
I
end
this
letter
.
<EOS>
My
next
,
will
,
perhaps
contain
my
trial
,
and
my
sentence
:
<EOS>
God
give
me
but
patience
and
resignation
,
and
then
whatever
occur
,
I
shall
not
be
unhappy
:
especially
while
I
can
have

in

the

<EOS>
just
above
I
call
my
state
,
a
state
of
cruel
suspense

<EOS>
but
I
recall
the
word
<EOS>
:
for
now
it
be
no
longer
suspense
;
since
,
if
this
letter
say
truth
,
I
know
the
bad
:
and
there
be
too
much
appearance
that
it
do
,
let
the
writer
be
who
he
will
,
or
his
or
her
motive
what
it
will
:
for
,
after
all
,
I
be
apt
to
fancy
this
a
contrivance
of
Mr.
Turner
's
,
though
,
for
fear
of
ill
consequence
,
I
will
not

so

<EOS>
and
now
,
Madam

I
be
endeavour
,
by
the

of

<EOS>
cool
reflection
,
to
bring
my
mind
to
bear
this
heavy
evil
,
and
to
recollect
what
I
be
,
and
how
much
more
honourable
an
estate
I
be
in
,
than
I
could
ever
have
expect
to
be
in
;
that
my
virtue
and
good
name
be
secure
;
and
I
can
return
innocent
to
my
dear
parent
:
and
these
be
once
the
only
pride
of
my

<EOS>
in

what

my

his
to

by
God

grace

I
can
conquer
every
thing

turn
my

to
hide
from
him
my

brimful
as

of

"
My

if
you

distract
not
my
soul
thus

by
your
dark
and
mysterious
speech

<EOS>
You
be
displeased
with
me
,
and
I
think
I
have
reason
,
of
late
,
to
take
something
amiss
in
your
conduct
;
but
,
instead
of
your
suffering
by
my
anger
,
you
have
word
and
an
air
that
penetrate
my
very
soul

"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Sir

Sir

treat
me
not
thus
kindly

Put
on
an
angrier
brow

how
shall
I
retain
my
purpose

<EOS>
how
shall
I

dear

make
not

of
all
your
power
to
melt
me
!
<EOS>
half
of
it
be
enough
.
<EOS>
for
there
be
eloquence
in
your
eye
I
can
not
resist
;
but
in
your
present
solemn
air
,
and
affect
sentence

you
mould
me
to
every
purpose
of
your
heart

so
that
I
be
a

machine

passive
instrument

to
be
play
upon
at
your

kind
Sir

how
you
revive
my
heart

by
your
goodness

<EOS>
perhaps
I
have
only
be
in
a
frightful
dream
,

be

just
now
awaken

we
will
not

<EOS>
only

Sir

give
order
,
that
you
be
not

be
speak
with
by
any
body

when

I
must
have
you
all
to
myself

without
interruption

"
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
have
say
this
,
a
gentleman
calling
<EOS>
,
I
retire
to
my
chamber
,
and
write
to
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
dismiss
his
friend
,
without
ask
him
to
dine
;
so
I
have
him
all
to
myself
at
dinner
 
<EOS>
but
we
say
little
,
and
sit
not
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
look
at
each
other
:
he
,
with
impatience
,
and
some
seeming
uneasiness
;
I
with
more
steadiness
,
I
believe
,
but
now
and
then
a
tear
start
.
  
<EOS>
I
eat
but
little
,
though
I
try
all
I
could
,
and
especially
as
he
help
me
,
and
court
me
with
tenderness
and
sweetness
 
<EOS>
o
why
be
ever
such
thing
as
masquerade
permit
in
a
christian
nation
!
  
<EOS>
I
choose
to
go
into
my
closet
rather
than
into
his
;
and
here
I
sit
,
wait
the
dear
gentleman
's
come
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
keep
but
<EOS>
my
courage
,
I
shall
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
bad
,
and
that
will
help
me
;
for
he
be
too
noble
to
use
me
roughly
,
<EOS>
when
he
see
I
mean
not
to
provoke
him
by
upbraiding
,
any
more
than
I
will
act
,
in
this
case
,
beneath
the
character
I
ought
to
assume
as
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
come
up
,
with
great
impatience
in
his
look
.
<EOS>
I
meet
him
at
the
chamber
door
,
with
a
very
sedate
countenance
,
and
my
heart
be
high
with
my
purpose
,
and
support
me
better
than
I
could
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
on
recollection
,
now
I
impute
to
myself
something
of
that
kind
of
magnanimity
,
<EOS>
that
be
will
not
to
inspire
the
innocent
sufferer
of
old
,
for
a
still
worthy
cause
than
mine
;
though
their
motive
could
hardly
be
more
pure
,
in
that
one
hope
I
have
,
to
be
an
humble
mean
of
save
the
man
I
love
and
honour
,
from
error
that
may
be
fatal
to
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
his
hand
with
boldness
:
 
"
dear
Sir
,
"
lead
him
to
my
closet
,

here
be
the
bar

I

my
trial

to
the
back

three
chair

which
I
have
place
in
a
joined
row

leave
just
room
to
go
by
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
give
me
,
Sir

all
my
own
way
;
this
be
the
first
,
and
perhaps
the
last
time
,
that
I
shall
desire
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
dear
Sir
,
"
turn
my
face
from
him
,
"
look
not
upon
me
with
an
eye
of
tenderness
:
if
you
do
I
may
lose
my
purpose
,
important
to
me
as
they
be

and
however
fantastic
my
behaviour
may
seem
to
you

I
want
not

good
impression
make

your

you

<EOS>
I
tell
him

that
since

I
would
take
the
liberty

I
be
glad

<EOS>
change
the

precipitately

as
above

that
I

prepare

I
part
with
him
with
great
pleasure
than
ever
I
do
in

<EOS>
so
necessary
sometimes
be
affliction
,
not
only
to
teach
one
how
to
subdue
one
's
passion
,
and
to
make
us
,
in
our
happy
state
,
<EOS>
know
we
be
still
on
earth
,
but
even
when
they
be
overblown
to
augment
and
redouble
our
joy
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
give
order
for
my
journey
,
and
quit
this
undelightful
town

as
it
have
be

<EOS>
My

I
hope
;

I
may
then
have
an
opportunity
to
acquaint
your

(
if
God

the
conclusion

My

<EOS>
I
rejoice
with
you
upon
the
turn
this
afflict
affair
have
take
,
through
your
inimitable
prudence
,
and
a
courage
I
think
not
in

<EOS>
a
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
to
give
you
so
much
discomposure
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
,
if
he
be
good
now
,
rave
against
him
,
as
I
be
go
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
impatient
to
hear
what
account
he
give
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
be
able
to
abandon
this
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
call
her
name
;
for
she
love
the
wretch
;
and
that
,
if
he
be
just
to
you
,
will
be
her
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
what
care
ought
these
young
widow
to
take
of
their
reputation
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
watchful
ought
they
to
be
over
themselves
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
hardly
out
of
her
weed
,
and
yet
must
go
to
a
masquerade
,
and
tempt
her
fate
,
with
all
her
passion
about
her
,
with
an
independence
,
and
an
affluence
of
fortune
,
that
make
her
able
to
think
of
nothing
but
gratify
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
good
quality
 
<EOS>
be
generous
 
<EOS>
be
noble
 
but
have
strong
passion
,
and
be
thoughtless
and
precipitant

<EOS>
My
lord
come
home
last
Tuesday
,
with
a
long
story
of
my
brother
and
her
:
for
I
have
keep
the
matter
as
secret
as
I
could
,
for
his
sake
and
yours
.
<EOS>
It
seem
he
have
it
from
Sir
John
 
,
uncle
to
the
young
Lord
C.
,
who
be
very
earnest
to
bring
on
a
treaty
of
marriage
between
her
and
his
nephew
,
who
be
in
love
with
her
,
and
be
a
fine
young
gentleman
;
but
have
hold
back
,
on
the
liberty
she
have
lately
give
herself
with
my
brother
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
she
be
innocent
,
as
to
fact
;
but
I
know
not
what
to
say
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
hang
,
if
he
do
not
say
she
be
.
<EOS>
yet
I
have
great
opinion
of
his
veracity
:
<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
so
bold
a
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
and
her
inconsideration
be
so
great
!
  
<EOS>
but
lest
I
should
alarm
your
fear
,
I
will
wait
till
I
have
the
account
he

you
of
this
dark
affair
;
till
when
,
I
congratulate
you
upon
the

to
quit
the

and

so
much
near

Tunbridge

<EOS>
forgive
me
,
Pamela
;
but
he
be
an
intriguing
wretch
,
and
I
would
not
have
you
to
be
too
secure
,
lest
the
disappointment
should
be
bad
for
you
,
than
what
you
know
before

but

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I

the

deportment
allow
there

give

great
advantage
in
my
eye
,
although
her
habit
require
,
as
I
think
,
a
little
more
gravity

circumspection

I
could
not
tell
how
to
resist
a
secret
pride
and
vanity

which
be

too
natural
to
both

to
the
right
honourable
the
countess
Dowager
of
#

#
#
"
   
that
after
this
,
the
fair
Nun
be
so
shy
,
so
reserved
,
and
seem
so
studiously
to
avoid
him
,
that
he
have
no
opportunity
to
return
her
handkerchief
;
and
the
Fanatic
observe
how
she
shun
him
,
say
,
in
French
,
"
what
,
Monsieur
,
have
you
do
to
your
Nun
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
her
to
be
a
very
coquette
;
and
tell
her
so
;
and
she
be
offend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
could
you
affront
a
lady
,
"
reply
he
,
"
with
such
a
charming
face
?
  
<EOS>
"
by
that
I
have
reason
to
think
,
"
say
Mr.
B.
,
"
that
he
have
see
her
unmask
;
and
I
say
,
"
It
become
not
any
character
,
but
that
you
wear
,
to
pry
into
the
secret
of
other
,
in
order
to
make
ill
-
natured
remark
,
and
perhaps
to
take
ungentlemanlike
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
man
should
make
that
observation
,
"
return
he
,
"
whose
view
would
bear
pry
into
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
nettle
,
"
say
Mr.
B.
,
"
at
this
warm
retort
,
and
draw
aside
my
mask
:
"
<EOS>
nor
would
any
man
,
who
wear
not
a
mask
,
tell
me
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
take
not
the
challenge
,
and
slide
from
me
,
and
I
see
him
no
more
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
so
!
<EOS>
"
think
I
,
"
another
instance
this
may
have
be
of
the
glorious
consequence
of
masquerade
.
<EOS>
"
o
my
lady
,
these
masquerade
be
abominable
thing
!
  
<EOS>
the
King
,
they
say
,
meet
with
a
free
speaker
that
night
:
in
truth
,
I
be
not
very
sorry
for
it
;
for
if
monarchs
will
lay
aside
their
sovereign
distinction
,
and
mingle
thus
in
masquerade
with
the
bad
as
well
as
the
high
<EOS>
(
I
can
not
say
best
)
of
their
subject
,
let
'em
take
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
perhaps
they
may
have
a
chance
to
hear
more
truth
here
than
in
their
palace
 
the
only
good
that
possibly
can
accrue
from
them
 
that
be
to
say
,
if
they
make
a
good
use
of
it
when
they
hear
it
.
<EOS>
for
you
see
,
my
monarch
,
though
he
tell
the
truth
,
as
it
happen
,
receive
the
hint
with
more
resentment
than
thankfulness
!
 
<EOS>
so
,
'
tis
too
likely
do
the
monarch
of
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
lady
,
you
need
not
doubt
,
that
so
polite
a
gentleman
would
find
an
opportunity
to
return
the
Nun
her
handkerchief
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
he
would
:
for
what
man
of
honour
would
rob
a
lady
of
any
part
of
her
apparel
?
<EOS>
and
should
he
,
that
want
to
steal
a
heart
content
himself
with
a
handkerchief
?
 
<EOS>
no
no
,
that
be
not
to
be
expect
.
<EOS>
so
,
what
do
he
do
,
but
resolve
,
the
very
next
day
,
after
dinner
,
to
pursue
this
affair
:
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
poor
Quaker
little
thinking
of
the
matter
,
away
go
her
naughty
Spaniard
,
to
find
out
his
Nun
at
her
grate
,
or
in
her
parlour
rather
.
  
<EOS>
He
ask
for
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
be
admit
into
the
outward
parlour
 
<EOS>
her
woman
come
down
;
require
his
name
and
business
.
<EOS>
His
name
he
mention
not
.
<EOS>
His
business
be
,
to
restore
into
her
lady
's
own
hand
,
something
she
have
dropt
<EOS>
the
night
before
.
 
<EOS>
be
desire
to
wait
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
say
,
that
he
be
dress
very
richly
 
have
no
design
at
all
to
make
conquest
;
<EOS>
no
,
not
he
!
 
<EOS>
o
this
wicked
love
of
intrigue
!
 
<EOS>
a
kind
of
olive
-
colour
velvet
,
and
fine
brocaded
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
he
take
leave
of
me
,
"
You
be
a
charming
Mr.
B.
,
"
and
salute
him
,
more
pressingly
than
he
return
it
;
but
little
<EOS>
do
I
think
,
when
I
plait
so
smooth
his
rich
laced
ruffle
,
and
bosom
,
where
he
be
go
,
or
what
he
have
in
his
plot
heart
.
<EOS>
He
go
in
his
own
chariot
,
that
he
do
:
so
that
he
have
no
design
to
conceal
who
he
be
 
<EOS>
but
intrigue
,
a
new
conquest
,
vanity
,
pride
!
 
<EOS>
o
these
man
!
 
<EOS>
They
have
nee
talk
of
lady
!
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
half
our
own
fault
,
indeed
it
be
,
to
encourage
their
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Madam
,
he
wait
till
his
stateliness
be
move
to
send
up
again
,
that
he
would
wait
on
her
ladyship
some
other
time
.
<EOS>
so
down
she
come
,
dress
most
richly
,
jewel
in
her
breast
,
and
in
her
hair
,
and
ear
 
<EOS>
but
with
a
very
reserved
and
stately
air
.
<EOS>
He
approach
her
 
Methinks
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
dear
saucy
gentleman
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Madam
,
what
a
noble
manner
of
address
he
have
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
the
handkerchief
from
his
bosom
with
an
air
;
and
kiss
it
,
present
it
to
her
,
say
,
"
this
happy
estray
,
thus
restore

beg
leave

by
me

acknowledge
its
lovely
owner

no

<EOS>
"
this

She
turn
to

a
coronet
at

corner

true

I
see
now

to
penetrate

unbecomingly

through
the

proper

especially
at
such
a
place

every
enquiry
should
begin

<EOS>
this
,
Madam
,
from
a
lady
,
who
have
unmask
 
because
she
would
not

<EOS>
very
pretty
,
indeed

<EOS>
oh
!

these
slight

easily

such
advantage

She
have
look
out

window

see
no

you

would
never

for
me

so
,
she
doubt
not

it
seem

he
be
an
unmarried
gentleman

as
he
have
intimate
to
her
the
night
before

He
tell
her
it
be
impossible
,
after
have
see
the
fine
lady
in

world

not

that

break
through
her

nor
have
he
make
any
enquiry

either
on
the
spot

off
it

have
have
a
much
well

by
accident

<EOS>

as
how

say
she
,
as
he
tell
me

with
so
bewitch
an
air

attentive

bold

forget
all

so
early
too

he
clasp
his
arm
around
her
waist
,
and
salute
her
,
struggle
with
anger

indignation
,
he
say
;

I
think
little
of
that

whence
this
insolence

how

Begone

her

ring
the

he
set
his
back
against

I
never
hear
such
boldness
in

<EOS>
till
she
would
forgive
him

<EOS>
and
,
it
be
plain
,
she
be
not

angry

she
pretend

for
her
woman
come

,
she
be
calm
;

"
fetch
my

go
;

then
she
say
,
"
You
tell
me

last

of
your
intrepidness

I

you
be

bold

,
Sir

surely
you
ought

know

that
you
be
not

Haymarket

"
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
truly
,
Madam

the
lady
may
have
save
herself
that
speech

for
,
upon

they
neither

mask

they
ought

have
put
on
one
of
blush

I
be
sure
I
do
for
them
,
while
I
be
write
.
<EOS>
Her
irresistible
loveliness
serve
for
an
excuse

that
she
could
not
disapprove
from
a
man
she
dislike
not

his
irresistible
 
<EOS>
may
I

,
assurance
,
Madam

find
too
ready
an
excuse

well

say
I

"
pray

then

Pray
,
do
she
find
it
out

you

patience

well

go
on

what
be
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

why
,
next
,
I
put
on
a
more
respectful

I
would
have
take
her
hand
indeed
,

she
would
not
permit
it
;

when
she

I
would
not
go
till
<EOS>
her
lavender
snuff
come
down
(
for
so
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
and
her
woman
be
not
in
haste
)
,
she
seat
herself
,
and
I
sit
by
her
,
and
begin
to
talk
about
a
charming
lady
I
see
the
night
before
,
after
part
with
her
ladyship
,
but
not
equal
by
any
mean
to
her
:
and
<EOS>
I
be
confident
this
would
engage
her
attention
;
for
I
never
know
the
lady
who
think
herself
handsome
,
that
be
not
take
by
this
topic

<EOS>
flattery
and
admiration
,
Pamela

be
the
two
principal
engine
by
which
our
sex
make
their
first
approach

yours

if

listen
to
us

we
be

either
by
the
sap

mine

succeed
,

you
up

suit
ourselves

foible

our
battery

I
have

at

no

be
carry
away

inconsideration

the
love

the
consequence

<EOS>
the

I
observe

have
abundance
of
fine
quality

I
think
I
could
converse
with
her

on
a
very
agreeable
foot

her
honour
I
know

at
any
time

would
preserve
me
mine

it
in
danger

I
prefer

not

that
,

your
virtue

would
be
another
barrier

my
fidelity

in

pride

I

frankly

that
gaiety

than

make
me
give
cause

at

have
a
wife

with

thousand
excellency

be
my
pride

my
boast

that
I
hold
it
very
possible
for
a
gentleman

lady
to
carry
on
an
innocent

honourable
friendship

way

I
be

when

would
not

that

give
reason

but
,
my

I
must
own
myself
extremely
blameable

I

nature

I
will
say
,
well
than
the

never
before
have

into
it

who

notwithstanding
that
wit

vivacity

every

give
herself
little
time
for
consideration

ought

more
carefully

inconveniencie

which
I
know
be
so
likely
to
arise
from
such
intimacy

the
rather
,
as
I
hint

because
the

have
no
apprehension

of
any

so
that

my

if
I
have
no

from
human
frailty

a

My

now
I
will
proceed
with
my
former
subject

and
with
the
great
pleasure
,
as
what
follow
make
still
more
in
favour
of

than
what
go
before

although
that
set
it
in
a
well
light
than
it
have
once
appear
to
me
in

begin

<EOS>
"
Will

out
into

will

<EOS>
"
  
"
'
tis
absolute
malice
and
falsehood

<EOS>
Our
intimacy
have
not
proceed
so
far
;
and
,
thoughtless
as
my
sister
's
letter
suppose
the
lady
,
she
would
have
spurn
at
such
a
proposal
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
then
,
Sir
,
as
to
the
expression
to
her
uncle
,
that
she
have
rather
have
be
a
certain
gentleman
's
second
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
may
,
in
a
passion
,
say
something
like
it
to
him
:
he
have
be
teaze
her
(
from
the
time
that
I
hold
an
argument
in
favour
of
that
foolish
topic
polygamy
,
in
his
company
and
his
niece
's
,
and
in
that
of
her
sister
and
the
Viscount
,
)
with
caution
against
converse
with
a
man
,
who
,
have
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
say
behind
my
back
,
marry
beneath
him
,
want
to
engage
the
affection
of
a
lady
of
birth
,
in
order
to
recover
,
by
double
that
fault
upon
her
,
his
lose
reputation
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
despise
his
insinuation
enough
to
answer
him
,
that
she
think
my
argument
in
behalf
of
polygamy
be
convincing
.
<EOS>
this
set
him
a
raving
,
and
he
throw
some
coarse
reflection
upon
her
,
which
could
not
be
repeat
,
if
one
may
guess
at
them
,
by
her
be
unable
to
tell
me
them
;
and
then
to
vex
him
more
,
and
to
revenge
herself
,
she
say
something
like
what
be
report
:
which
be
handle
enough
for
her
uncle
;
who
take
care
to
propagate
it
with
an
indiscretion
peculiar
to
himself
;
for
I
hear
it
in
three
different
company
,
before
I
know
any
thing
of
it
from
herself
;
and
when
I
do
,
it
be
so
repeat
,
as
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
would
hardly
have
censure
her
for
it
,
the
provocation
consider
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
then
,
dear
Sir
,
there
be
nothing
at
all
amiss
,
at
this
rate
,
in
the
correspondence
between
my
lady
and
you
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
on
her
side

I
dare
say
,
if
her
ladyship
can
be
excuse
to
punctilio
,
and
for
have
a
great
esteem
for
a
married
man

than

deserve

point

.
<EOS>
Sir

what
then
be
there
on
your
side

in
that
matter

that
make
you
give
me
so
patient
and
so
kind
a
hearing

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
my
dear
,
you
come
to
the
point
:
at
first
it
be
nothing
in
me
but
vanity
,
pride
,
and
love
of
intrigue
,
to
try
my
strength
,
where
I
have
meet
with
some
encouragement
,
as
I
think
,
at
the
masquerade
;
where
the
lady
go
farther
,
too
,
than
she
would
have
do
,
have
she
not
think
I
be
a
single
man
.
<EOS>
for
,
by
what
I
have
tell
you
,
Pamela
,
you
will
observe
,
that
she
try
to
satisfy
herself
on
that
head
,
as
soon
as
she
well
could
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Nelthorpe
acquaint
me
afterwards
,
when
better
know
to
each
other
,
that
her
lady
be
so
partial
in
my
favour
,
(
who
can
always
govern
their
fancy
,
my
dear
?
)
<EOS>
as
to
think
,
so
early
as
at
the
masquerade
,
that
if
every
thing
answer
appearance
,
and
that
I
be
a
single
man
,
she
,
who
have
a
noble
and
independent
fortune
,
may
possibly
be
induce
to
make
me
happy
in
her
choice
.
  
<EOS>
"
supposing
,
then
,
that
I
be
unmarried
,
she
leave
a
signal
for
me
in
her
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
I
visit
her
;
have
the
honour
,
after
the
customary
first
shyness
,
of
be
well
receive
;
and
continue
my
visit
,
till
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
she
would
have
be
glad
I
have
not
be
marry
,
but
on
find
I
be
,
she
avoid
me
,
as
I
have
tell
you
,
till
the
accident
I
mention
throw
us
again
upon
each
other
:
which
renew
our
intimacy
upon
term
you
would
think
too
inconsiderable
on
one
side
,
and
too
design
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
myself
,
what
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
only
that
you
give
me
great
disgust
(
without
cause
,
as
I
think
,
)
by
your
unwonted
reception
of
me
,
ever
in
tear
and
grief
;
the
Countess
ever
cheerful
and
lively
;
and
fear
that
your
temper
be
entirely
change
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
have
no
bad
excuse
to
try
to
make
myself
easy
and
cheerful
abroad
,
since
my
home
become
more
irksome
to
me
than
ever
I
believe
it
could
be
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
we
naturally
love
those
who
love
us
,
I
have
vanity
,
and
some
reason
for
my
vanity
<EOS>
(
indeed
all
vain
<EOS>
man
believe
they
have
,
)
to
think
the
Countess
have
more
than
an
indifference
for
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
exasperate
by
the
wrong
method
take
with
an
independent
lady
of
her
generous
spirit
,
to
break
off
our
acquaintance
,
that
,
in
revenge
,
she
deny
me
less
than
ever
opportunity
of
her
company
.
<EOS>
the
pleasure
we
take
in
each
other
's
conversation
be
reciprocal

<EOS>
the
world
's
report
have
unite
us
in
one
common
cause
:
and
you
,
as
I
say
,
have
make
home
less
delightful
to
me
than
it
use
to
be
:
what
may
not
then
have
be
apprehend
from
so
many
circumstance
concur
with
the
lady

beauty

my
frailty

<EOS>
where
people
's
tongue
will
take
so
much
liberty
,
without
any
foundation
,
and
where
the
utmost
circumspection
be
use
,
what
will
they
not

,
where
so
little
of
the
latter
be
observe

<EOS>
no
wonder
,
then
,
that
term
be
say
to
be
agree
upon
between
us
:
from
her
uncle
's
story
,
of
polygamy
propose
by
me
,
and
seemingly
agree
to
by
her
,
no
wonder
that
all
your
Thomasine
Fuller
's
information
be
surmise
.
<EOS>
thus
stand
the
matter
,
when
I
be
determined
to
give
your
cause
for
uneasiness
a
hearing

and
to
take
my
measure
accord
to
what
should
result
from
that
hearing

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
from
this
account
,
dear
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
will
not
be
so
difficult
,
as
I
fear
,
to
end
this
affair
even
to
her
ladyship
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not

my

<EOS>

but
if
,
now
,
Sir
,
the
Countess
should
still
be
desirous
not
to
break
with
you
;
from
so
charm
a
lady
,
who
know
what
may
happen
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
Pamela
;
but
to
make
you
still
easy
,
I
will
tell
you
that
her
ladyship
have
a
first
cousin
marry
to
a
person
go
with
a
public
character
to
several
of
the
italian
court
,
and
,
have
it
not
be
for
my
persuasion
,
she
would
have
accept
of
their
earnest
invitation
,
and
pass
a
year
or
two
in
Italy
,
where
she
once
reside
for
three
year
together
,
which
make
her
so
perfect
a
mistress
of
italian
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
I
will
let
her
know
,
additionally
to
what
I
have
write
to
her
,
the
uneasiness
I
have
give
you
,
and
,
so
far
as
it
be
proper
,
what
be
come
to
your
ear
,
and
your
generous
account
of
her
,
and
the
charm
of
her
person
,
of
which
she
will
not
be
a
little
proud
;
for
she
have
really
noble
and
generous
sentiment
,
and
think
well
(
though
her
sister
,
in
pleasantry
,
will
have
it
a
little
enviously
,
)
of
you
;
and
when
I
shall
endeavour
to
persuade
her
to
go
,
for
the
sake
of
her
own
character
,
to
a
place
and
country
of
which
she
be
always
fond
,
I
be
apt
to
think
she
will
come
into
it
;
for
she
have
a
great
opinion
of
my
judgment
than
it
deserve
:
and
I
know
a
young
lord
,
who
may
be
easily
persuade
to
follow
her
thither
,
and
bring
her
back
his
lady
,
if
he
can
obtain
her
consent
:
<EOS>
and
what
say
you
,
Pamela
,
to
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
o
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
begin
to
love
the
lady
dearly
,
and
that
be
what
I
never
think
I
should
.
<EOS>
I
hope
this
will
be
bring
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
see
,
give
me
leave
to
say
,
Sir
,
how
dangerously
you
may
both
have
go
on
,
under
the
notion
of
this
platonic
love
,
till
two
precious
soul
have
be
lose
:
and
this
shew
one
,
as
well
in
spiritual
as
temporal
,
from
what
slight
beginning
the
great
mischief
sometimes
spring
;
and
how
easily
at
first
a
breach
may
be
stop
,
that
,
when
neglect
,
the
wave
of
passion
will
widen
till
they
bear
down
all
before
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
observation
,
my
dear
,
be
just
,
"
reply
Mr.
B.
,
"
and
though
,
I
be
confident
the
lady
be
more
in
earnest
than
myself
in
the
notion
of
platonic
love
,
yet
I
be
convinced
,
and
always
be
,
that
platonic
love
be
platonic
nonsense
:
'
<EOS>
tis
the
fly
buzz
about
the
blaze
,
till
its
wing
be
scorch
;
or
,
to
speak
still
strong
,
it
be
a
bait
of
the
devil
to
catch
the
unexperienced
,
and
thoughtless
:
nor
ought
such
notion
to
be
pretend
to
,
till
the
party
be
five
or
ten
year
on
the
other
side
of
their
grand
climateric
:
for
age
,
old
age
,
and
nothing
else
,
must
establish
the
barrier
to
platonic
love
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
my
comparative
consolation
,
though
a
very
bad
one
,
that
have
I
swerve
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
give
the
only
instance
,
where
person
more
scrupulous
than
I
pretend
to
be
,
have
begin
friendship
even
with
spiritual
view
,
and
end
them
as
grossly
as
I
could
have
do
,
be
the
lady
to
have
be
as
frail
as
her
tempter
.

He

Tunbridge

to
how
many

I
have

I
say

in

that
your

set
out
on
Tuesday
morning
for
Tunbridge

my
paper

and
I
long
to
know
the
result

that
every

would
be
conclude
to
the
satisfaction
of
all

I

if
this

my

must
be
permanent
:
"
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
permanent
in
this
life
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
by
experience
now
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
before
by
theory
:
but
that
be
not
so
near
and
interesting
by
half
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
with
all
my
pleasure
and
hope
;
in
the
midst
of
my
dear
parent
'
joy
and
congratulation
on
our
arrival
,
and
on
what
have
pass
so
happily
since
we
be
last
here
together
,
(
in
the
birth
of
the
dear
child
,
and
my
safety
,
for
which
they
have
be
so
apprehensive
,
)
the
poor
baby
be
take
ill
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
that
very
Tuesday
his
papa
set
out
for
Tunbridge
;
but
we
know
not
it
would
be
the
small
-
pox
till
Thursday
.
<EOS>
o
Madam
!
<EOS>
how
be
all
the
pleasure
I
have
form
to
myself
sicken
now
upon
me
!
<EOS>
for
my
Billy
be
very
bad
.
  
<EOS>
They
talk
of
a
kind
sort
:
<EOS>
but
alas
:
they
talk
at
random
:
for
they
come
not
out
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
fear
the
nurse
's
constitution
be
too
hale
and
too
rich
for
the
dear
baby
!
 
<EOS>
have
I
be
permit
 
but
hush
,
all
my
repine
ifs

<EOS>
except
one
if
;
and
that
be
,
if
it
be
get
happily
over
,
it
will
be
good
he
have
it
so
young

while
at
the
breast
!
    
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
the
small
appearance
that
there
be
be
go
in
again
:
and
my
child
,
my
dear
baby
,
will
die
!
<EOS>
the
doctor
seem
to
think
so
.
  
<EOS>
They
want
to
send
for
Mr.
B.
to
keep
me
from
him
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
forbid
it
!
 
<EOS>
for
what
signify
life
,
or
any
thing
,
if
I
can
not
see
my
baby
,
while
he
be
so
dangerously
ill
!
  
<EOS>
My
father
and
mother
be
,
for
the
first
time
,
quite
cruel
to
me
;
they
have
forbid
me
,
and
I
never
be
so
desirous
of
disobey
them
before
,
to
attend
the
darling
of
my
heart
:
and
why
?
 
<EOS>
for
fear
of
this
poor
face
!
 
<EOS>
for
fear
I
should
get
it
myself
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
live
very
low
,
and
have
take
proper
precaution
by
bleed
,
and
the
like
,
to
lessen
the
distemper
's
fury
,
if
I
should
have
it
;
and
the
rest
I
leave
to
Providence
.
<EOS>
and
if
Mr.
B.
's
value
be
confine
so
much
to
this
poor
transitory
sightliness
,
he
must
not
break
with
his
Countess
,
I
think
;
and
if
I
be
ever
so
deform
in
person
,
my
poor
intellect
,
I
hope
will
not
be
impair
,
and
I
shall
,
if
God
spare
my
Billy
,
be
useful
in
his
first
education
,
and
be
helpful
to
dear
Miss
Goodwin
 
or
to
any
baby
 
with
all
my
heart
 
<EOS>
he
may
make
me
an
humble
nurse
too
!
 
<EOS>
how
peevish
,
sinfully
so
,
I
doubt
,
do
this
accident
,
and
their
affectionate
contradiction
,
make
one
!

have
this
moment
receive
the

:
and
now
,
bless
be
God
!
<EOS>
who
have
give
me
hope
that
our
prayer
be
hear
,
the
pustule
come
kindly
out
,
very
thick
in
his
breast
,
and
on
his
face
:
but
of
a
good
sort
,
they
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
not
let
me
see
him
;
indeed
they
will
not
!
 
<EOS>
what
cruel
kindness
be
this
!
<EOS>
one
must
believe
all
they
tell
one
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
lady
,
my
spirit
be
so
weak
;
I
have
such
a
violent
headache
,
and
have
such
a
strange
shivering
disorder
all
run
down
my
back
,
and
I
be
so
hot
just
now
,
and
be
so
cold
at
this
present
 
<EOS>
aguishly
inclined
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
!
<EOS>
that
I
must
leave
off
,
the
post
go
away
,
with
the
assurance
,
that
I
be
,
and
will
be
,
to
the
last
hour
of
my
life
,
your
ladyship
's
grateful
and
obliged
sister
and
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
from
Mr.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
sister
,
  
<EOS>
I
take
very
kindly
your
solicitude
for
the
health
of
my
beloved
Pamela
.
<EOS>
the
last
line
she
write
be
to
you
,
for
she
take
to
her
bed
the
moment
she
lay
down
her
pen
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
your
kind
message
,
and
wish
for
her
safety
,
by
my
lord
's
gentleman
;
and
she
beg
I
would
write
a
line
to
thank
you
in
her
name
for
your
affectionate
regard
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
fine
way
to
do
well
:
for
with
her
accustomed
prudence
,
she
have
begin
to
prepare
herself
by
a
proper
regiman
,
the
moment
she
know
<EOS>
the
child
's
illness
be
the
small
-
pox
.
  
<EOS>
the
bad
be
over
with
the
boy
,
which
keep
up
her
spirit
;
and
her
mother
be
so
excellent
a
nurse
to
both
,
and
we
be
so
happy
likewise
in
the
care
of
a
skilful
physician
,
Dr.
M.
(
who
direct
and
approve
of
every
thing
the
good
dame
do
,
)
that
it
be
a
singular
providence
this
malady
seize
them
here
;
and
afford
no
small
comfort
to
the
dear
creature
herself
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
tell
you
,
that
,
to
all
appearance
,
her
charming
face
will
not
receive
any
disfigurement
by
this
cruel
enemy
to
beauty
,
I
be
sure
you
will
congratulate
me
upon
a
felicity
so
desirable
:
but
be
it
to
be
otherwise
,
if
I
be
capable
of
slight
a
person
,
whose
principal
beauty
be
much
deep
than
the
skin
,
I
should
deserve
to
be
think
the
most
unworthy
and
superficial
of
husband
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
your
notion
have
be
,
my
ever
-
ready
censure
Lady
Davers
,
of
your
brother
,
on
a
certain
affair
,
I
do
assure
you
,
that
I
never
do
,
and
never
can
,
love
any
woman
as
I
love
my
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
impossible
I
can
ever
love
her
better
than
I
do
;
and
her
outward
beauty
be
far
from
be
indifferent
to
me
;
yet
,
if
I
know
myself
,
I
be
sure
I
have
justice
enough
to
love
her
equally
,
and
generosity
enough
to
be
more
tender
of
her
,
be
she
to
suffer
by
this
distemper
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
her
humility
,
and
her
affection
to
me
,
would
induce
her
to
think
herself
under
great
obligation
to
me
,
for
such
my
tenderness
to
her
,
be
she
to
lose
any
the
least
valuable
of
her
perfection
,
I
rejoice
that
she
will
have
no
reason
for
mortification
on
that
score
.
  
<EOS>
My
respect
to
Lord
Davers
,
and
your
noble
neighbour
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
your
affectionate
brother
,
and
humble
servant
.
    
<EOS>
from
Lady
Davers
,
in
answer
to
the
precede
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
brother
,
  
I
do
most
heartily
congratulate
you
on
the
recovery
of
Master
Billy
,
and
the
good
way
my
sister
be
in
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
more
rejoice
,
as
her
sweet
face
be
not
like
to
suffer
by
the
malady
;
for
,
be
the
beauty
of
the
mind
<EOS>
what
they
will
,
those
of
the
person
be
no
small
recommendation
,
with
some
folk
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
;
and
I
begin
to
be
afraid
,
that
when
it
be
hardly
possible
for
both
conjoin
to
keep
a
rove
mind
constant
,
that
one
only
would
not
be
sufficient
.
  
<EOS>
this
news
give
me
more
pleasure
,
because
I
be
well
informed
,
that
a
certain
gay
lady
be
pleased
to
give
herself
air
upon
learn
of
my
sister
's
illness
,
as
,
that
she
would
not
be
sorry
for
it
;
for
now
she
should
look
upon
herself
as
the
pretty
woman
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
She
mean
only
,
I
suppose
,
as
to
outward
prettiness
,
brother
!
  
<EOS>
You
give
me
the
name
of
a
ready
censurer
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
think
myself
to
be
not
a
little
interested
in
all
that
regard
my
brother
,
and
his
honour
.
<EOS>
but
when
some
people
be
not
ready
to
censure
,
than
other
to
trespass
,
I
know
not
whether
they
can
with
justice
be
style
censorious
.
  
<EOS>
but
however
that
be
,
the
rod
seem
to
have
be
hold
up
,
as
a
warning
 
and
that
the
blow
,
in
the
irreparable
deprivation
,
be
not
give
,
<EOS>
be
a
mercy
,
which
I
hope
will
be
deserve
;
though
you
never
can
those
very
signal
one
you
receive
at
the
Divine
hand
,
beyond
any
man
I
know
.
<EOS>
for
even
(
if
I
shall
not
be
deem
censorious
again
)
<EOS>
your
very
vice
have
be
turn
to
your
felicity
,
as
if
God
would
try
the
nobleness
of
the
heart
he
have
give
you
,
by
overcome
you
(
in
answer
to
my
sister
's
constant
prayer
,
as
well
as
mine
)
by
mercy
rather
than
by
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
give
instance
of
the
truth
of
this
observation
,
in
almost
all
the
action
and
attempt
of
your
past
life
;
and
take
care
<EOS>
(
if
you
be
displeased
,
I
will
speak
it
)
,
take
care
,
thou
bold
wretch
,
that
if
this
method
be
ungratefully
slight
,
the
uplifted
arm
fall
not
down
with
double
weight
on
thy
devoted
head
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
always
love
and
honour
my
brother
,
but
can
not
help
speak
my
mind
:
which
,
after
all
,
be
the
natural
result
of
that
very
love
and
honour
,
and
which
oblige
me
to
style
myself
your
truly
affectionate
sister
,
  
B.
Davers
.
    
<EOS>
from
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers

<EOS>
my
dearest
lady
,
  
<EOS>
My
first
letter
,
and
my
first
devoir
,
after
those
of
thankfulness
to
that
gracious
God
,
who
have
so
happily
conduct
me
through
two
such
heavy
trial
,
as
my
child
's
and
my
own
illness
,
must
be
direct
to
you
,
with
all
due
acknowledgment
of
your
generous
and
affectionate
concern
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
prepare
for
our
journey
to
Bedfordshire
;
and
there
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
,
I
be
to
be
favour
with
the
care
of
Miss
Goodwin
.
  
<EOS>
after
tarry
about
a
month
there
,
Mr.
B.
will
make
a
tour
with
me
through
several
county
(
take
the
Hall
in
the
way
)
for
about
a
fortnight
,
and
shew
me
what
be
remarkable
,
every
where
as
we
pass
;
for
this
,
he
think
,
will
better
contribute
to
my
health
,
than
any
other
method
.
<EOS>
the
distemper
have
leave
upon
me
a
kind
of
weariness
and
listlessness
;
and
he
propose
to
be
out
with
me
till
the
Bath
season
begin
;
and
by
the
aid
of
those
healing
and
balsamic
water
,
he
hope
,
I
shall
be
quite
establish
.
<EOS>
afterwards
to
return
to
Bedfordshire
for
a
little
while
;
then
to
London
;
and
then
to
Kent
;
and
,
if
nothing
hinder
,
have
a
great
mind
to
carry
me
over
to
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
thus
most
kindly
do
he
amuse
and
divert
me
with
his
agreeable
proposal
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
make
one
amendment
to
them
;
and
that
is
,
that
I
must
not
be
deny
to
pay
my
respect
to
your
ladyship
,
at
your
seat
,
and
to
my
good
Lady
Countess
in
the
same
neighbourhood
,
and
this
will
be
far
from
be
the
least
of
my
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
congratulation
without
number
upon
my
recovery
;
but
one
,
among
the
rest
,
I
do
not
expect
;
from
the
Countess
Dowager
(
could
you
think
it
,
Madam
?
)
<EOS>
who
send
me
by
her
gentleman
the
following
letter
from
Tunbridge
.
  
<EOS>
"
MADAM

I
hope
,
among
the
congratulation
of
your
numerous
admirer
,
on
your
happy

my
very
sincere
one
will
not
be
unacceptable

<EOS>
I
have
no
other
motive
for

you
my
compliment
on
this
occasion

on
so
slend
an

than
the
pleasure

May

<EOS>
to

I
return

"

<EOS>
I

under
the
high
obligation
to
your
generous

in

congratulation
on

<EOS>
there
be
something
so
noble
and
so
condescend
in
the
honour
you
have

,
on
so
slend
an

that
it

P.B.
"
  
<EOS>
this
lead
me
to
mention
,
what
my
illness
would
not
permit
me
to
do
before
,
that
Mr.
B.
meet
with
such
a
reception
and
audience
from
the
Countess
,
when
he
attend
her
,
in
all
he
have
to
offer
and
propose
to
her
,
and
in
her
patient
hearing
of
what
he
think
fit
to
read
her
,
from
your
ladyship
's
letter
and
mine
,
that
he
say
,
"
do
not
be
jealous
,
my
dear
Pamela
;
but
I
must
admire
her
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
the
particular
,
so
much
to
her
ladyship
's
honour
,
that
I
tell
him
,
he
should
not
only
be
welcome
to
admire
her
ladyship
,
but
that
I
would
admire
her
too
.
  
<EOS>
They
part
very
good
friend
,
and
with
great
profession
of
esteem
for
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
Mr.
B.
have
undertake
to
inspect
into
some
exceptionable
account
and
management
of
her
ladyship
's
bailiff
,
one
of
her
servant
bring
a
letter
for
him
on
Monday
last
,
wholly
write
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
so
considerate
,
as
to
send
it
unseal
,
in
a
cover
direct
to
me
.
<EOS>
when
I
open
it
,
I
be
frightened
to
see
it
begin
to
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
I
hasten
to
find
him
 
<EOS>
"
dear
Sir
 
<EOS>
here
be
some
mistake
 
<EOS>
You
see
the
direction
be
to
Mrs.
B.

Tis
very
plain
 
<EOS>
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
have
not
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
do
not
be
uneasy
,
my
love

<EOS>
I
know
what
the
subject
must
be
;
but
I
dare
swear
there
be
nothing
,
nor
will
there
ever
be
,
but
what
you
or
any
body
may
see

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
read
it
,
and
give
it
to
me
,
say
,
"
answer
yourself
the

if

the

I
beg
you
will
not

concern

I
will
then
set
about
the

myself
;
for
my
uncle
I
will
not
trouble
;
yet
woman
enter
into
these
particular
with
as
little
advantage
to
themselves
as
inclination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
be
entirely
easy
and
unapprehensive
;
and
,
after
all
his
goodness
to
me
,
should
be
so
,
if
he
see
the
Countess
every
day

<EOS>

that
be
kindly

my

I
will
not
trust
myself
to
see
her
every
day

at
all
,
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
oblige
to
correspond
with
her
for
a
month
or
so
,
on
this
occasion

unless
you
prohibit
it
;
and
it
shall
be
in
your
power
to
do
so

"
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
with
my
whole
heart
,
he
may
;
and
I
should
be
quite
easy
in
both
their
honour

<EOS>
"
yet
I
will
not

say
he
,
"
unless
you
see
our
letter
<EOS>
:
for
I
know
she
will
always
,
now
she
have
begin
,
send
in
a
cover
to
you
,
what
she
will
write
to
me
,
unseal
;
and
whether
I
be
at
home
or
abroad
,
I
shall
take
it
unkindly
,
if
you
do
not
read
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
in
,
and
write
an
answer
,
which
he
send
by
the
messenger
;
but
would
make
me
,
whether
I
would
or
not
,
read
it
,
and
seal
it
up
with
his
seal
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
need
not
to
me
now
,
who
think
so
much
well
of
the
lady
than
I
do
before
;
and
be
so
well
satisfied
in
his
own
honour
and
generous
affection
for
me
;
for
you
see
,
Madam
,
in
what
I
write
before
,
that
he
always
love
me
,
though
he
be
angry
at
time
,
at
my
change
of
temper
,
as
he
fear
,
not
know
that
I
be
apprise
of
what
have
pass
between
him
and
the
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
I
really
be
better
pleased
with
his
correspondence
,
than
I
should
have
be
,
have
it
not
be
carry
on
;
because
the
servant
,
on
both
side
,
will
see
,
by
my
deportment
on
the
occasion
(
and
I
will
officiously
,
with
a
smile
countenance
,
throw
myself
in
their
observation
)
,
that
it
be
quite
innocent
;
and
this
may
help
to
silence
the
mouth
of
those
who
have
so
freely
censure
their
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
Madam
,
I
think
I
have
receive
no
small
good
myself
by
that
affair
,
which
once
lie
so
heavy
upon
me
:
for
I
do
not
believe
I
shall
be
ever
jealous
again
;
indeed
I
do
not
think
I
shall
.
<EOS>
and
will
not
that
be
an
ugly
foible
overcome
?
<EOS>
I
see
what
may
be
do
,
in
case
not
favourable
to
our
wish
,
by
the
aid
of
proper
reflection
;
and
that
the
bee
be
not
the
only
creature
that
may
make
honey
out
of
the
bitter
flower
as
well
as
the
sweet
.
  
<EOS>
My
most
grateful
respect
and
thank
to
my

Davers

and
to
Mr.

all
your

on
my

<EOS>
what
obligation
do
I
lie
under
to
such
noble
and
generous
well

<EOS>
I
can
make
no

but
by
my
prayer

that
God

by
his

will
supply
all
my

My

<EOS>
how
many
blessing
have
I
to
be
thankful
for
!
  
<EOS>
We
be
about
to
turn
traveller
,
to
the
northern
county
.
<EOS>
I
think
quite
to
the
border
:
and
afterwards
to
the
western
,
to
Bath
,
Bristol
,
<EOS>
and
I
know
not
whither
myself
:
<EOS>
but
among
the
rest
,
to
Lincolnshire
,
that
you
may
be
sure
of
.
<EOS>
then
how
happy
shall
I
be
in
my
dear
Miss
Darnford
!
  
<EOS>
I
long
to
hear
whether
poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
well
or
bad
for
the
advice
of
the
doctor
,
whom
I
order
to
attend
her
from
Stamford
,
and
in
what
frame
her
mind
be
.
<EOS>
do
vouchsafe
her
a
visit
in
my
name
;
tell
her
,
if
she
be
low
spirited
,
what
God
hath
do
for
me
,
as
to
my
recovery
,
and
comfort
her
all
you
can
;
and
bid
her
spare
neither
expence
nor
attendance
,
nor
any
thing
her
heart
can
wish
for
;
nor
the
company
of
any
relation
or
friend
she
may
desire
to
be
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
if
she
be
in
her
last
stage
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
how
noble
will
it
be
in
you
to
give
her
comfort
and
consolation
in
her
die
hour
!
<EOS>
although
we
can
merit
nothing
at
the
hand
of
God
,
yet
I
have
a
notion
,
that
we
can
not
deserve
more
of
one
another
,
and
in
some
sense
,
for
that
reason
,
of
him
,
than
in
our
charity
on
so
try
an
exigence
!
<EOS>
when
the
poor
soul
stand
shivering
,
as
it
be
,
on
the
verge
of
death
,
and
have
nothing
strong
,
but
its
fear
and
doubt
;
then
a
little
balm
pour
into
the
wound
of
the
mind
,
a
little
comforting
advice
to
rely
on
God
's
mercy
,
from
a
good
person
<EOS>
,
how
consolatory
must
it
be
!
<EOS>
and
how
,
like
morning
mist
before
the
sun
,
must
all
diffidence
and
gloomy
doubt
,
be
chase
away
by
it
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
,
the
great
occasion
of
my
writing
to
you
just
now
,
be
by
Lady
Davers
's
desire
,
on
a
quite
different
subject
.
<EOS>
She
know
how
we
love
one
another

<EOS>
and
she
have
send
me
the
follow
line
by
her
kinsman
,
who
come
to
Kent
,
purposely
to
enquire
how
my
face
fare
in
the
small

pox
;
and
accompany
us
hither
,
[
i.e.
to
Bedfordshire

and
set
out
to

morrow
for
Lord
Davers
's

<EOS>
"
my
dear
pamela

Jackey
will
tell
you
the
reason
of
his
journey
,
my
curiosity
on
your
own
account
;
and
I
send
this
letter
by
him
,
but
he
know
not
the
content
.
<EOS>
My
good
Lord
Davers
want
to
have
his
nephew
marry
,
and
settle
in
the
world
:
and
his
noble
father
leave
the
whole
matter
to
my
lord
,
as
to
the
person
,
settlement
,
&
c.
<EOS>
now
I
,
as
well
as
he
,
think
so
highly
of
the
prudence
,
the
person
,
and
family
of
your
Miss
Darnford
,
that
we
shall
be
oblige
to
you
,
to
sound
the
young
lady
on
this
score
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
Mr.
H.
would
wish
for
no
great
happiness
.
<EOS>
but
if
she
be
engage
,
or
can
not
love
my
nephew
,
I
do
not
care
,
nor
would
my
lord
,
that
such
a
proposal
should
be
receive
with
undue
slight
.
<EOS>
His
birth
,
and
the
title
and
estate
<EOS>
he
be
heir
to
,
be
advantage
that
require
a
lady
's
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
so
much
wit
as
Miss
,
but
enough
for
a
lord
,
whose
friend
be
bear
before
him
,
as
the
phrase
be
;
be
very
good
-
humoured
,
no
tool
,
no
sot
,
no
debauchee
:
and
,
let
me
tell
you
,
this
be
not
to
be
meet
with
every
day
in
a
young
man
of
quality
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
settlement
,
fortune
,
&
c.
<EOS>
I
fancy
there
would
be
no
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
the
business
be
,
if
Miss
Darnford
could
love
him
well
enough
for
a
husband
?
<EOS>
that
we
leave
you
to
sound
the
young
lady
;
and
if
she
think
she
can
,
we
will
directly
begin
a
treaty
with
Sir
Simon

<EOS>
I

my

Pamela

your
ever
affectionate

B.
Davers

"
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
friend
,
as
my
lady
have
so
well
state
the
case
,
I
beg
you
to
enable
me
to
return
an
answer
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
one
word
pro
or
con
.
<EOS>
till
I
know
your
mind
 
only
,
that
I
think
he
be
good
-
humoured
and
may
be
easily
persuade
to
any
thing
a
lady
should
think
reasonable
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
another
piece
of
news
in
the
matrimonial
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
have
be
here
to
congratulate
us
on
our
multiplied
blessing
;
and
he
acquaint
Mr.
B.
that
an
overture
have
be
make
him
by
his
new
patron
,
of
a
kinswoman
of
his
lordship
's
,
a
person
of
virtue
and
merit
,
and
a
fortune
of
three
thousand
pound
,
to
make
him
amend
,
as
the
earl
tell
him
,
for
quit
a
well
live
to
oblige
him
;
and
that
he
be
in
great
hope
of
obtain
the
lady
's
consent
,
which
be
all
that
be
want
.
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
be
much
pleased
with
so
good
a
prospect
in
Mr.
Williams
's
favour
,
and
be
in
the
lady
's
company
formerly
at
a
ball
,
at
Gloucester
;
he
say
,
she
be
prudent
and
deserving
;
and
offer
to
make
a
journey
on
purpose
to
forward
it
,
if
he
can
be
of
service
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
that
all
be
adjust
,
accord
to
the
scheme
I
formerly
acquaint
you
with
,
between
Mr.
Adams
and
that
gentleman
;
and
both
be
settle
in
their
respective
living
.
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
have
tell
you
,
that
Mr.
Williams
,
upon
mature
deliberation
,
decline
the
stipulate
eighty
pound
per
annum
from
Mr.
Adams
,
as
he
think
it
would
have
a
simoniacal
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
my
hand
be
in
<EOS>
,
let
me
tell
you
of
a
third
matrimonial
proposition
,
which
give
me
more
puzzle
and
dislike
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
and
that
be
,
Mr.
Adams
have
,
with
great
reluctance
,
and
after
abundance
of
bashful
apology
,
ask
me
,
if
I
have
any
objection
to
his
make
his
address
to
<EOS>
Polly
Barlow
?
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
he
tell
me
,
he
have
not
mention
to
her
,
nor
to
any
body
live
,
because
he
would
first
know
whether
I
should
take
it
amiss
,
as
her
service
be
so
immediately
about
my
person
.
  
<EOS>
this
unexpected
motion
much
perplex
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Adams
be
a
worthy
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
a
very
good
living
;
yet
just
enter
upon
it
;
and
,
I
think
,
accord
to
his
accustomed
prudence
in
other
respect
,
have
better
have
turn
himself
about
first
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
the
point
with
me
neither
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
regard
to
the
function
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
as
necessary
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
respect
due
to
the
clergy
,
that
their
wife
should
be
nearly
,
if
not
quite
as
unblemished
,
and
as
circumspect
,
as
themselves
;
and
this
for
the
gentleman
's
own
sake
,
as
well
as
in
the
eye
of
the
world
:
for
how
shall
he
pursue
his
study
with
comfort
to
himself
,
if
make
uneasy
at
home
!
<EOS>
or
how
shall
he
expect
his
female
parishioner
will
regard
his
public
preaching
,
if
he
can
not
have
a
due
influence
over
the
private
conduct
of
his
wife
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
except
in
the
instance
of
Mr.
H.
but
Polly
be
a
good
sort
of
body
enough
so
far
as
I
know
;
but
that
be
such
a
blot
in
the
poor
girl
's
escutcheon
,
a
thing
not
accidental
,
nor
surprised
into
,
not
owe
to
inattention
,
but
to
cool
premeditation
,
that
,
I
think
,
I
could
wish
Mr.
Adams
a
wife
more
unexceptionable
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
true
,
Mr.
Adams
know
not
this
,
but
that
be
one
of
my
difficulty
.
<EOS>
if
I
acquaint
him
with
it
,
I
shall
hurt
the
poor
girl
irreparably
,
and
deprive
her
of
a
husband
,
to
whom
she
may
possibly
make
a
good
wife
 
<EOS>
for
she
be
not
very
meanly
descend
 
much
well
than
myself
,
as
the
world
would
say
be
a
judgment
to
be
make
from
my
father
's
low
estate
,
when
I
be
exalt
 
<EOS>
I
never
,
my
dear
,
shall
be
ashamed
of
these
retrospection
!
<EOS>
She
be
genteel
,
have
a
very
innocent
look
,
a
good
face
,
be
neat
in
her
person
,
and
not
addicted
to
any
excess
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
that
one
premeditated
fault
,
be
so
sad
<EOS>
a
one
,
though
she
may
make
a
good
wife
for
any
middling
man
of
business
,
yet
<EOS>
she
want
,
methink
,
that
discretion
,
that
purity
,
which
I
would
always
have
in
the
wife
of
a
good
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
she
have
not
apply
her
thought
to
that
sort
of
economy
,
which
the
wife
of
a
country
clergyman
ought
to
know
something
of
;
and
have
such
a
turn
to
dress
and
appearance
,
that
I
can
see
,
if
indulge
,
she
would
not
be
one
that
would
help
to
remove
the
scandal
which
some
severe
remarker
be
apt
to
throw
upon
the
wife
of
parson
,
as
they
call
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
maiden
,
I
believe
,
like
Mr.
Adams
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
courteous
to
every
body
,
but
most
to
him
of
any
body
,
and
never
have
miss
be
present
at
our
Sunday
's
duty
;
and
five
or
six
time
,
Mrs.
Jervis
tell
me
,
she
have
find
her
desirous
to
have
Mr.
Adams
expound
this
text
,
and
that
difficulty
;
and
the
good
man
be
take
with
her
piety
,
<EOS>
which
,
and
her
reformation
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
be
sincere
;
but
she
be
very
sly
,
very
subtle
,
as
I
have
find
in
several
instance
,
as
foolish
as
she
be
in
the
affair
I
hint
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
"
sometimes
I
say
to
myself
,
"
the
girl
may
love
Mr.
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
but
then
I
answer
,
"
so
<EOS>
she
do
Mr.
H.
and
on
his
own
very
bad
term
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
short
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
be
too
censorious
neither
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
will
say
no
more
,
than
that
I
be
perplex
;
and
yet
should
be
very
glad
to
have
polly
well
married
;
for
,
since
that
time
,
I
have
always
have
some
diffidence
about
her
 
because
,
you
know
,
Miss
 
<EOS>
her
fault
be
so
enormous
,
and
,
as
I
have
say
,
so
premeditated
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
advise
with
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
method
I
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
appoint
Mr.
Adams
to
drink
a
dish
of
tea
with
me
.
<EOS>
Polly
attend
,
as
usual
;
for
I
can
not
say
I
love
man
attendant
in
these
womanly
office
.
<EOS>

tea

,
that
would
,
if
there
be
no
well
employment
for
him
,
be
fitter
to
hold
a
plough
,
or
handle
a
flail
,
or
a
scythe
,
have
such
a
look
with
it
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
like
my
low
breeding
,
some
would
say
,
perhaps
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
call
thing
polite
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
unseemly
;
and
,
moreover
.
<EOS>
Lady
Davers
keep
me
in
countenance
in
this
my
notion
;
and
who
doubt
her
politeness
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
but
Polly
attend
,
as
I
say
;
and
there
be
strange
simpering
,
and
bowing
,
and
curt'sying
,
between
them
;
the
honest
gentleman
seem
not
to
know
how
to
let
his
mistress
wait
upon
him
;
while
she
behave
with
as
much
respect
and
officiousness
,
as
if
she
could
not
do
too
much
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
think
I
,
"
I
have
such
an
opinion
of
your
veracity
,
Mr.
Adams
,
that
I
dare
say
you
have
not
mention
the
matter
to
Polly
;
but
between
her
officiousness
,
and
your
mutual
simpering
and
complaisance
,
I
see
you
have
find
a
language
between
you
,
that
be
full
as
significant
as
plain
english
word
.
<EOS>
polly
,
"
think
I
,
"
see
no
difficulty
in
this
text
;
nor
need
you
,
Mr.
Adams
,
have
much
trouble
to
make
her
understand
you
,
when
you
come
to
expound
upon
this
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
force
,
in
short
,
to
put
on
a
stately
and
more
reserved
appearance
than
usual
,
to
make
them
avoid
act
of
complaisance
for
one
another
,
that
may
not
be
proper
to
be
shew
before
me
,
for
one
who
sit
as
my
companion
,
to
my
servant
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
withdraw
,
the
modest
gentleman
hem
,
and
look
on
one
side
,
and
turn
to
the
right
and
leave
,
as
if
his
seat
be
uneasy
to
him
,
and
,
I
see
,
know
not
how
to
speak
;
so
I
begin
in
mere
compassion
to
him
,
and
say
 
"
Mr.
Adams
,
I
have
be
think
of
what
you
mention
to
me
,
as
to
Polly
Barlow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
hem
!
hem
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
;
and
pull
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
wipe
his
mouth
 
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
Madam
<EOS>
;
I
hope
no
offence
,
Madam
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Sir
,
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
at
a
loss
how
to
distinguish
in
this
case
;
whether
it
may
not
be
from
a
motive
of
too
humble
gratitude
,
that
you
do
not
think
yourself
above
match
with
Polly
,
as
you
may
suppose
her
a
favourite
of
mine
;
or
whether
it
be
your
value
for
her
person
and
quality
,
that
make
her
more
agreeable
in
your
eye
,
than
any
other
person
would
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
 
Madam
,
"
say
the
bashful
gentleman
,
hesitatingly
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
 
<EOS>
I
must
needs
<EOS>
say
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
own
 
that
 
Mrs.
Mary
 
be
a
person
-
whom
I
think
very
agreeable
;
and
no
less
modest
and
virtuous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Sir
,
your
own
circumstance
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
you
have
a
very
pretty
house
,
and
a
good
living
,
to
carry
a
wife
to
.
<EOS>
and
a
gentleman
of
your
prudence
and
discretion
want
not
any
advice
;
but
you
have
reap
no
benefit
by
your
living

<EOS>
It
have
be
an
expence
to
you
rather
,
which
you
will
not
presently
get
up
:
do
you
propose
an
early
marriage
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
not
well
to
suspend
your
intention
of
that
sort
for
a
year

two
more

Madam

Mr.

not

I
humbly
beg
pardon

breed
danger

<EOS>
"
oh
I
very
well

think
I
;

if

<EOS>
and
so
,
Miss

it
have
prove
 
<EOS>
for
,
dismiss
my

with
assure
him
,
that
I
have
no
objection
at

to
the
matter

to
part

as
soon
as
it
suit
with

conveniency
 
<EOS>
I
sound
her

ask
,
if
she
think
Mr.

have
any
affection

<EOS>
She
say
he
be
a
very
good

<EOS>
"
I
know

be
you

<EOS>
"
Dear

<EOS>
love
me
 
<EOS>
I
do
not

such
a

<EOS>
"
oh
!

think
I

do

<EOS>
I
see

not

"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
Polly
,
if
you
have
another
sweetheart
,
you
should
do
the
fair
thing
;
it
would
be
wrong
,
if
you
encourage
any
body
else
,
if
you
think
of
Mr.
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
I
have
a
letter
send
me
 
a
letter
that
I
receive
 
from
 
from
a
young
man
in
Bedford
;
but
I
never
answer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
think
I
,
"
then
thou
wouldst
not
encourage
two
at
once
;
"
and
this
be
as
plain
a
declaration
as
I
want
,
that
she
have
thought
of
Mr.
Adams
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
come
Mr.
Adams
,
Polly
,
to
know
of
this
letter
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
come
he
to
know
of
it
,
madam
!
"
 
<EOS>
repeat
she
 
half
surprised
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
do
not
know
,
I
can
not
tell
how
it
be
 
<EOS>
but
I
drop
it
near
his
desk
 
pull
out
my
handkerchief
,
I
believe
,
madam
,
and
he
bring
it
,
and
give
it
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
think
I
,
"
thou'rt
an
intriguing
slut
,
I
doubt
,
Polly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
delay
may
breed
danger
,
"
quoth
the
poor
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
girl
,
girl
!
"
<EOS>
think
I
,
but
do
not
say
so
,
"
thou
deserv
to
have
thy
plot
spoil
,
that
thou
dost
 
<EOS>
but
if
thy
forwardness
should
expose
thee
afterwards
to
evils
which
thou
mayest
avoid
if
thy
scheme
take
place
,
I
should
very
much
blame
myself
.
<EOS>
and
I
see
he
love
thee
 
<EOS>
so
let
the
matter
take
its
course
;
I
will
trouble
myself
no
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
,
that
thou
wilt
make
Mr.
Adams
as
good
a
wife
as
he
deserve
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
I
dismiss
her
,
tell
her
,
that
whoever
think
of
be
a
clergyman
's
wife
,
should
resolve
to
be
as
good
as
himself
;
to
set
an
example
to
all
her
sex
in
the
parish
,
and
shew
how
much
his
doctrine
have
weight
with
her
;
should
be
humble
,
circumspect
,
gentle
in
her
temper
and
manner
,
frugal
,
not
proud
,
nor
vie
in
dress
with
the
lady
of
the
laity
;
<EOS>
should
resolve
to
sweeten
his
labour
,
and
to
be
oblige
in
her
deportment
to
poor
as
well
as
rich
,
that
her
husband
get
no
discredit
through
her
mean
,
which
would
weaken
his
influence
upon
his
auditor
;
and
that
she
must
be
most
of
all
oblige
to
him
,
and
study
his
temper
,
that
his
mind
may
be
more
disengaged
,
in
order
to
pursue
his
study
with
the
well
effect
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
much
for
your
humble
servant
;
<EOS>
and
for
Mr.
Williams
's
and
Mr.
Adams
's
matrimonial
prospect
;
 
and
do
not
think
me
so
disrespectful
,
that
I
have
mention
my
Polly
's
affair
in
the
same
letter
with
yours
.
<EOS>
for
in
high
and
low
(
I
forget
the
latin
phrase
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
have
a
lesson
a
long
,
long
while
,
from
my
dear
tutor
)
love
be
in
all
the
same
!
 
<EOS>
but
whether
you
will
like
Mr.
H.
as
well
as
Polly
do
Mr.
Adams
,
that
be
the
question
.
<EOS>
but
,
leave
that
to
your
own
decision
,
I
conclude
with
one
observation
;
that
,
although
I
think
our
's
be
a
house
of
as
little
intriguing
as
any
body
's
,
since
the
dear
master
of
it
have
leave
off
that
practice
,
yet
I
can
not
see
,
that
any
family
can
be
clear
of
some
of
it
long
together
,
where
there
be
man
and
woman
worth
plot
for
,
as
husband
and
wife
.
  
<EOS>
My
good
wish
and
respect
attend
all
your
worthy
neighbour
.
<EOS>
I
hope
ere
long
,
to
assure
them
,
severally
(
to
wit
,
Sir
Simon
,
my
lady
,
Mrs.
Jones
,
Mr.
Peters
,
and
his
lady
and
niece
,
whose
kind
congratulation
make
me
very
proud
,
and
very
thankful
)
how
much
I
be
oblige
to
them
;
and
particularly
,
my
dear
,
how
much
I
be
your
ever
affectionate
and
faithful
friend
and
servant
,
P.
B
,
    
from
Miss
Darnford
,
in
answer
to
the
precede
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
MRS
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
several
time
(
in
company
with
Mr.
Peters
)
to
see
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
<EOS>
the
poor
woman
be
very
bad
,
and
can
not
live
many
day
.
<EOS>
We
comfort
her
all
we
can
;
but
she
often
accuse
herself
of
her
past
behaviour
to
so
excellent
a
lady
;
and
with
blessing
upon
blessing
,
heap
upon
you
,
and
her
master
,
and
your
charming
little
boy
,
be
continually
declare
how
much
your
goodness
to
her
aggravate
her
former
fault
to
her
own
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
a
sister
-
in
-
law
and
her
niece
with
her
,
and
have
settle
all
her
affair
,
and
think
she
be
not
long
for
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
Her
distemper
be
an
inward
decay
,
all
at
once
as
it
be
,
from
a
constitution
that
seem
like
one
of
iron
;
and
she
be
a
mere
skeleton
:
<EOS>
you
would
not
know
her
,
I
dare
say
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
see
her
every
day
;
and
she
have
give
me
up
all
her
key
,
and
account
,
to
give
to
Mr.
Longman
,
who
be
daily
expect
,
and
<EOS>
I
hope
will
be
here
soon
;
for
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
she
say
herself
,
be
a
woman
of
this
world
,
as
she
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
call
upon
me
to
go
with
him
to
visit
her
,
I
will
break
off
here
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
much
as
she
be
;
but
your
faithful
steward
be
come
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
 
<EOS>
and
so
be
she
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
I
will
go
every
day
,
and
do
all
the
good
I
can
for
the
poor
woman
,
accord
to
your
charitable
desire
.
  
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
your
communication
of
Lady
Davers
's
letter
,
I
be
much
oblige
to
my
lord
,
and
her
ladyship
;
and
should
have
be
proud
of
an
alliance
with
that
noble
family
,
but
with
all
Mr.
H.
's
good
quality
,
as
my
lady
paint
them
out
,
and
his
other
advantage
,
I
could
not
,
for
the
world
,
make
him
my
husband
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
one
of
my
objection
,
in
confidence
,
however
,
(
for
you
be
only
to
sound
me
,
you
know
:
)
and
I
would
not
have
it
mention
that
I
have
take
any
thought
about
the
matter
,
because
a
strong
reason
may
be
give
,
such
a
one
as
my
lord
and
lady
will
both
allow
;
which
I
will
communicate
to
you
by
and
bye
.
 
<EOS>
My
objection
arise
even
from
what
you
intimate
,
of
Mr.
H.
's
good
humour
,
and
his
persuadableness
,
if
I
may
so
call
it
.
<EOS>
now
,
be
I
of
a
boisterous
temper
,
and
high
spirit
,
such
an
one
as
require
great
patience
in
a
husband
to
bear
with
me
,
then
Mr.
H.
's
good
humour
may
have
be
a
consideration
with
me
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
have
(
I
pride
myself
in
the
thought
)
<EOS>
a
temper
not
wholly
unlike
your
own
,
and
such
an
one
as
would
not
want
to
contend
for
superiority
with
a
husband
<EOS>
,
it
be
no
recommendation
to
me
,
that
Mr.
H.
be
a
good
-
humoured
gentleman
,
and
will
bear
with
fault
I
design
not
to
be
guilty
of
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
my
husband
must
be
a
man
of
sense
,
and
give
me
reason
to
think
he
have
a
superior
judgment
to
my
own
,
or
I
shall
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
He
will
otherwise
do
wrong
-
head
thing
:
I
shall
be
force
to
oppose
him
in
them
:
he
will
be
tenacious
and
obstinate
,
be
teach
to
talk
of
prerogative
,
and
to
call
himself
a
man
,
without
know
how
to
behave
as
one
,
and
I
to
despise
him
,
of
course
;
so
be
deem
a
bad
wife
,
<EOS>
when
,
I
hope
,
I
have
quality
that
would
make
me
a
tolerable
good
one
,
with
a
man
of
sense
for
my
husband
.
  
<EOS>
now
you
must
not
think
I
would
dispense
with
real
good
-
humour
in
a
man
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
make
it
one
of
my
indispensable
in
a
husband
.
<EOS>
a
good
-
natured
man
will
put
the
good
construction
on
what
happen
;
but
he
must
have
sense
to
distinguish
the
good
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
kind
to
little
,
unwilful
,
undesigned
failing
:
but
he
must
have
judgment
to
distinguish
what
be
or
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
H.
's
good
-
humour
be
softness
,
as
I
may
call
it
;
and
my
husband
must
be
such
an
one
,
in
short
,
as
I
need
not
be
ashamed
to
be
see
with
in
company
;
one
who
,
be
my
head
,
must
not
be
beneath
all
the
gentleman
he
may
happen
to
fall
in
with
,
and
who
,
every
time
he
be
adjust
his
mouth
for
speech
,
will
give
me
pain
at
my
heart
,
and
blush
in
my
face
,
even
before
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
,
therefore
,
that
every
one
we
encounter
should
be
prepare
,
whenever
he
offer
to
open
his
lip
,
by
their
contemptuous
smile
,
to
expect
some
weak
and
silly
thing
from
him
;
and
when
he
have
speak
,
that
he
should
,
with
a
booby
grin
,
seem
pleased
that
he
have
not
disappoint
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
recommendatory
point
in
Mr.
H.
be
,
that
he
dress
exceedingly
smart
,
and
be
no
contemptible
figure
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Madam
,
you
know
,
that
be
so
much
the
bad
,
when
the
man
's
talent
be
not
taciturnity
,
except
before
his
aunt
,
or
before
Mr.
B.
or
you
;
when
he
be
not
conscious
of
internal
defect
,
and
value
himself
upon
outward
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
his
attempt
upon
your
Polly
,
though
I
do
not
like
him
the
well
for
it
,
yet
it
be
a
fault
so
wickedly
common
among
man
,
that
when
a
woman
resolve
never
to
marry
,
till
a
quite
virtuous
man
address
her
,
it
be
,
in
other
word
,
resolve
to
die
single
;
so
that
I
make
not
this
the
chief
objection
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
would
abate
in
my
expectation
of
half
a
dozen
other
good
quality
,
rather
than
that
one
of
virtue
in
a
husband
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
reflect
upon
the
figure
Mr.
H.
make
in
that
affair
,
I
can
not
bear
him
;
and
,
<EOS>
if
I
may
judge
of
other
coxcomb
by
him
,
what
wretch
be
these
smart
,
well
-
dress
querpo
fellow
,
many
of
whom
you
and
I
have
see
admire
themselves
at
the
play
and
opera
!
  
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
my
infallible
rule
,
and
I
know
it
be
yours
too
;
that
he
who
be
take
up
with
the
admiration
of
his
own
person
,
will
never
admire
a
wife
's
.
<EOS>
His
delight
be
centre
in
himself
,
and
he
will
not
wish
to
get
out
of
that
exceed
narrow
circle
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
should
keep
no
company
but
<EOS>
that
of
taylor
,
wig
-
puffer
,
and
milliner
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
run
on
no
further
upon
this
subject
;
but
will
tell
you
a
reason
,
which
you
may
give
to
Lady
Davers
,
why
her
kind
intention
to
me
can
not
be
answer
;
and
which
she
will
take
better
than
what
I
have
say
,
be
she
to
know
it
,
as
I
hope
you
will
not
let
her
:
and
this
be
,
my
papa
have
have
a
proposal
make
to
him
from
a
gentleman
you
have
see
,
and
have
think
polite
.
<EOS>
It
be
from
Sir
W.G.
of
this
county
,
who
be
one
of
your
great
admirer
,
and
Mr.
B.
's
too
;
and
that
,
you
must
suppose
,
make
me
have
never
the
bad
opinion
of
him
,
or
of
his
understanding
;
although
it
require
no
great
sagacity
or
penetration
to
see
how
much
you
adorn
our
sex
,
and
human
nature
too
.
  
<EOS>
every
thing
be
adjust
between
my
papa
and
mamma
,
and
Sir
William
,
on
condition
we
approve
of
each
other
,
before
I
come
down
;
which
I
know
not
,
till
I
have
see
him
here
four
time
;
and
then
my
papa
surprise
me
into
half
an
approbation
of
him
:
and
this
,
it
seem
,
be
one
of
the
reason
why
I
be
so
hurried
down
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
but
I
like
the
man
as
well
as
most
I
have
see
;
he
be
a
man
of
sense
and
sobriety
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
in
very
easy
circumstance
,
and
much
respect
by
all
who
know
him
;
which
be
no
bad
earnest
in
a
marriage
prospect
.
<EOS>
but
,
hitherto
,
he
seem
to
like
me
better
than
I
do
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
;
but
I
often
observe
,
that
when
any
thing
be
in
our
power
,
we
be
not
half
so
much
take
with
it
,
as
we
should
be
,
perhaps
,
if
we
be
keep
in
suspense
!
<EOS>
why
should
this
be
?
 
<EOS>
but
this
I
be
convince
of
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
comparison
between
Sir
William
and
Mr.
Murray
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
have
name
this
brother
-
in
-
law
of
mine
;
what
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
that
good
couple
have
have
their
house
on
fire
three
time
already
.
<EOS>
once
it
be
put
out
by
Mr.
Murray
's
mother
,
who
live
near
them
;
and
twice
Sir
Simon
have
be
force
to
carry
water
to
extinguish
it
;
for
,
truly
,
Mrs.
Murray
would
go
home
again
to
her
papa
;
she
would
not
live
with
such
a
surly
wretch
:
and
it
be
with
all
his
heart
;
a
fair
riddance
!
<EOS>
for
there
be
no
bearing
the
house
with
such
an
ill
-
natured
wife
:
 
<EOS>
her
sister
Polly
be
worth
a
thousand
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
sorry
for
their
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
but
could
she
think
every
body
must
bear
with
her
,
and
her
fretful
way
?
 
<EOS>
They
will
jangle
on
,
I
reckon
,
till
they
be
better
use
to
one
another
;
and
when
he
see
she
can
not
help
it
,
why
he
will
bear
with
her
,
as
husband
generally
do
with
ill
-
temper
wife
;
he
will
try
to
make
himself
happy
abroad
,
and
leave
her
to
quarrel
with
her
maid
,
instead
of
him
;
for
she
must
have
somebody
to
vent
her
<EOS>
spleen
upon
 
poor
Nancy
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
of
Mr.
Williams
's
good
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Adams
know
not
Polly
's
fault
,
and
it
be
prevent
in
time
,
they
may
be
happy
enough
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
sly
girl
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
her
so
:
something
so
innocent
,
and
yet
so
artful
in
her
very
look
:
she
be
an
odd
compound
.
<EOS>
but
these
worthy
and
piously
turn
young
gentleman
,
who
have
but
just
quit
the
college
,
be
mere
novice
,
as
to
the
world
:
indeed
they
be
above
it
,
while
in
it
;
they
therefore
give
themselves
little
trouble
to
study
it
,
and
so
,
depend
on
the
goodness
of
their
own
heart
,
be
more
liable
to
be
impose
upon
than
people
of
half
their
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
since
he
seem
to
love
her
,
you
do
right
not
to
hinder
the
girl
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
but
I
wish
she
may
take
your
advice
,
in
her
behaviour
to
him
,
at
least
:
for
as
to
her
carriage
to
her
neighbour
,
I
doubt
she
will
be
one
of
the
head
of
the
parish
,
presently
,
in
her
own
estimation
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
pity
,
methink
,
any
worthy
man
of
the
cloth
should
have
a
wife
,
who
,
by
her
bad
example
,
should
pull
down
,
as
fast
as
he
,
by
a
good
one
,
can
build
up
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
case
of
Mrs.
Peters
,
however
;
whose
example
I
wish
be
more
generally
follow
by
gentlewoman
,
who
be
make
so
by
marry
good
clergyman
,
if
they
be
not
so
before
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
be
surprised
,
if
you
should
hear
that
poor
Jewkes
be
give
over
!
 
<EOS>
She
make
a
very
exemplary
 
full
of
blessing
 
and
more
easy
and
resign
,
than
I
apprehend
she
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
shed
a
tear
for
the
poor
woman
:
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
myself
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
be
pleased
that
she
have
so
much
time
give
her
,
and
make
so
good
use
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Peters
have
be
every
thing
that
one
would
wish
one
of
his
function
to
be
,
in
his
attendance
and
advice
to
the
poor
woman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
will
take
proper
care
of
every
thing
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
will
only
add
,
that
I
be
,
with
the
sincere
respect
,
in
hope
to
see
you
soon
<EOS>
(
for
I
have
a
multitude
of
thing
to
talk
to
you
about
)

,
your
ever
faithful
and
affectionate
POLLY
DARNFORD

<EOS>
from
Mrs.
B.
to
Lady
Davers
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
lady
daver
,
  
<EOS>
I
understand
from
Miss
Darnford
,
that
before
she
go
down
from

,
her
papa
have
encourage
a
proposal
make
by
Sir
W.G.
whom
you
see
,
when
your
ladyship
be
a
kind
visitor
in
Bedfordshire
.
<EOS>
We
all
agree
,
if
you
remember
,
that
he
be
a
polite
and
sensible
gentleman
,
and
I
find
it
be
countenance
on
all
hand
.
<EOS>
poor
Mrs.
Jewkes
,
Madam
,
as
Miss
inform
me

have

<EOS>
I
hope
,
through
mercy
,
she
be
happy
!
 
<EOS>
poor
,
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
but
why
say
I
so
!
 
<EOS>
since
,
in
that
case
,
she
will
be
rich
than
an
earthly
monarch
!
  
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
be
once
mention
a
sister
of
Mrs.
Worden
's
whom
you
wish
to
recommend
to
some
worthy
family
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
beg
of
you
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
to
oblige
Mr.
B.
's
in
this
particular
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
must
have
merit
if
your
ladyship
think
well
of
her
;
and
your
command
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
every
other
particular
in
my
power
,
shall
have
their
due
weight
with
your
ladyship
's
oblige
sister
and
humble
servant
,
P.B.
  
<EOS>
just
now
,
dear
Madam
,
Mr.
B.
tell
me
I
shall
have
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwill
bring
me
hither
to
-
morrow
.
    
<EOS>
from
Lady
Davers
to
Mrs.
B.
in
answer
to
the
precede
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
pamela
,
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
be
likely
to
be
so
happy
in
a
husband
,
as
Sir
W.G.
will
certainly
make
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
that
my
proposal
would
not
do
with
her
,
have
she
not
have
so
good
a
tender
.
<EOS>
I
want
too
,
to
have
the
foolish
fellow
married
 
for
several
reason
;
one
of
which
be
,
he
be
continually
tease
us
to
permit
him
to
go
up
to
town
,
and
reside
there
for
some
month
,
in
order
that
he
may
see
the
world
,
as
he
call
it
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
convinced
he
would
feel
it
,
as
well
as
see
it
,
if
we
give
way
to
his
request
:
for
in
understanding
,
dress
,
and
inconsiderate
vanity
,
he
be
so
exactly
cut
out
and
sized
for
a
town
fop
,
coxcomb
,
or
pretty
fellow
,
that
he
will
undoubtedly
fall
into
all
the
vice
of
those
people
;
and
,
perhaps
,
have
such
expectation
as
he
have
,
will
be
make
the
property
of
rake
and
sharper
.
<EOS>
He
complain
that
we
use
him
like
a
child
in
a
go
-
cart
,
or
a
baby
with
lead
-
string
,
and
that
he
must
not
be
trust
out
of
our
sight
.
'
<EOS>
tis
a
sad
thing
,
that
these
body
will
grow
up
to
the
stature
of
man
,
when
the
mind
improve
not
at
all
with
them
,
but
be
still
those
of
boy
and
child
.
<EOS>
yet
,
he
would
certainly
make
a
fond
husband
:
for
he
have
no
very
bad
quality
.
<EOS>
but
be
such
a
Narcissus
!
 
<EOS>
but
this
between
ourselves
,
for
his
uncle
be
wrapt
up
in
the
fellow
 
<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
because
he
be
good
-
humour
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
vex
me
lately
,
which
make
me
write
so
angrily
about
him
 
<EOS>
but
'
tis
not
worth
trouble
you
with
the
particular
.
<EOS>
I
hope
Mrs.
Jewkes
be
happy
,
as
you
say
!
 
<EOS>
poor
woman
!
<EOS>
she
seem
to
promise
for
a
long
life
!
<EOS>
but
what
shall
we
say
?
  
<EOS>
Your
compliment
to
me
,
about
my
Beck
's
sister
,
be
a
very
kind
one
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Oldham
be
a
sober
,
grave
widow
,
a
little
aforehand
,
in
the
world
,
but
not
much
;
have
live
well
;
understand
house
-
hold
management
thoroughly
;
be
diligent
;
and
have
a
turn
to
serious
thing
,
which
will
make
you
like
her
the
well
.
<EOS>
I
will
order
Beck
and
her
to
wait
on
you
,
and
she
will
satisfy
you
in
every
thing
as
to
what
you
may
,
or
may
not
expect
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
kindly
I
take
this
motion
from
you
.
<EOS>
You
forget
nothing
that
can
oblige
your
friend
.
<EOS>
little
do
I
think
you
would
remember
me
of
(
what
I
have
forget
in
a
manner
)
<EOS>
my
favourable
opinion
and
wish
for
her
express
so
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
be
what
you
be
 
a
dear
oblige
creature
.
  
<EOS>
Beck
be
all
joy
and
gratitude
upon
it
,
and
her
sister
have
rather
serve
you
than
the
princess
.
<EOS>
You
need
be
under
no
difficulty
about
term
:
she
would
serve
you
for
nothing
,
if
you
would
accept
of
her
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
,
because
it
please
you
so
much
,
that
Miss
Goodwin
will
be
soon
put
into
your
care
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
happy
for
the
child
,
and
I
hope
she
will
be
so
dutiful
as
to
give
you
no
pain
for
your
generous
goodness
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
mamma
have
send
me
a
present
of
some
choice
product
of
that
climate
,
with
acknowledgment
of
my
kindness
to
Mississippi
<EOS>
I
will
send
part
of
it
to
you
by
your
new
servant
;
for
so
I
presume
to
call
her
already
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
naughty
sister
be
you
,
however
,
to
be
so
far
advanced
again
as
to
be
oblige
to
shorten
your
intended
excursion
,
and
yet
not
to
send
me
word
of
it
yourself
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
how
much
I
interest
myself
in
every
thing
that
make
for
my
brother
's
happiness
and
your
'
?
<EOS>
more
especially
in
so
material
<EOS>
a
point
as
be
the
increase
of
a
family
that
it
be
my
boast

Must

<EOS>
this

next

fall

ardently
solicit

<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
be
a
sweet
child
;
but
,
permit
me
to
say
,
have
a
little
of
her
papa
's
spirit
;
hasty
,
yet
generous
and
acknowledge
when
she
be
convince
of
her
fault
;
a
little
haughty
and
prouder
than
I
wish
her
to
be
;
but
in
every
thing
else
deserve
the
character
I
give
of
her
to
her
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
very
fond
of
fine
clothe
,
be
a
little
too
lively
to
the
servant
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
once
,
when
I
take
notice
that
softness
and
mildness
of
speech
become
a
young
lady
,
that
they
be
but
servant
!
<EOS>
and
she
could
say
no
more
than
,
"
pray
,
"
and
"
I
desire
,
"
and
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
be
so
kind
,
"
to
her
uncle
or
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
that
good
servant
deserve
any
civil
distinction
;
and
that
so
long
as
they
be
ready
to
oblige
in
every
thing
,
by
a
kind
word
,
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
give
them
imperative
one
,
which
could
serve
for
no
other
end
but
to
convince
observer
of
the
haughtiness
of
one
's
own
temper
;
and
look
,
as
if
one
would
question
their
compliance
with
our
will
,
unless
we
would
exact
it
with
an
high
hand
;
which
may
cast
a
slur
upon
the
command
we
give
,
as
if
we
think
it
be
hardly
so
reasonable
as
otherwise
to
obtain
their
observation
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
besides
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
do
not
consider
,
that
if
you
speak
as
haughtily
and
commandingly
to
them
on
common
,
as
on
extraordinary
occasion
,
you
weaken
your
own
authority
,
if
even
you
should
be
permit
to
have
any
,
and
they
will
regard
you
no
more
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
great
notice
of
what
I
say
,
and
when
her
little
proud
heart
be
subdue
by
reasoning
she
can
not
answer
,
she
will
sit
as
if
she
be
study
what
to
say
,
to
come
off
as
fly
as
she
can
,
and
as
the
case
require
,
I
let
her
go
off
easily
,
or
push
the
little
dear
to
her
last
refuge
,
and
make
her
quit
her
post
,
and
yield
up
her
spirit
a
captive
to
Reason
and
Discretion
:
two
excellent
commander
,
with
whom
,
I
tell
her
,
I
must
bring
her
to
be
intimately
acquaint
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
after
all
,
till
I
can
be
sure
that
I
can
inspire
her
with
the
love
of
virtue
,
for
its
own
sake
<EOS>
,
I
will
rather
try
to
conduct
her
spirit
to
proper
end
,
than
endeavour
totally
to
subdue
it
;
be
sensible
that
our
passion
be
give
us
for
excellent
end
,
and
that
they
may
,
by
a
proper
direction
,
be
make
subservient
to
the
noble
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
her
sometimes
,
there
may
be
a
decent
pride
in
humility
,
and
that
it
be
very
possible
for
a
young
lady
to
behave
with
so
much
true
dignity
,
as
shall
command
respect
by
the
turn
of
her
eye
,
sooner
than
by
asperity
of
speech
;
that
she
may
depend
upon
it
,
the
person
,
who
be
always
find
fault
,
frequently
cause
them
;
and
that
it
be
no
glory
to
be
better
bear
than
servant
,
if
she
be
not
better
behave
too
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
I
tell
her
humility
be
a
grace
that
shine
in
a
high
condition
,
but
can
not
equally
in
a
low
one
;
because
that
be
already
too
much
humble
,
perhaps
:
and
that
,
though
there
be
a
censure
lie
against
be
poor
and
proud
,
yet
I
would
rather
forgive
pride
in
a
poor
body
,
than
in
a
rich
:
for
in
the
rich
it
be
insult
and
arrogance
,
proceed
from
their
high
condition
;
but
in
the
poor
it
may
be
a
defensative
against
dishonesty
,
and
may
shew
a
natural
bravery
of
mind
,
perhaps
,
if
properly
direct
,
and
manifest
on
right
occasion
,
that
the
frown
of
fortune
can
not
depress
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
she
hear
every
day
thing
from
me
,
which
her
governess
never
teach
her
.
  
<EOS>
that
may
very
well
be
,
I
tell
her
,
because
her
governess
have
many
young
lady
to
take
care
of
:
<EOS>
I
but
one
;
and
that
I
want
to
make
her
wise
and
prudent
betime
,
that
she
may
be
an
example
to
other
Misses
;
and
that
governesses
and
mammas
shall
say
to
their
miss
,
"
when
will
you
be
like
Miss
Goodwin
?
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
Miss
Goodwin
say
a
naughty
word
?
<EOS>
Would
Miss
Goodwin
,
think
you
,
have
do
so
or
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
throw
her
arm
about
my
neck
,
on
one
such
occasion
as
this
;
"
oh
,
"
say
she
,
"
what
a
charming
mamma
have
I
get
!
<EOS>
I
will
be
in
every
thing
as
like
you
,
as
ever
I
can
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
you
will
love
me
,
and
so
will
my
uncle
,
and
so
will
every
body
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
whom
now
-
and
-
then
,
she
say
,
she
love
as
well
as
if
he
be
her
own
papa
,
see
with
pleasure
how
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
but
she
tell
me
,
I
must
not
have
any
daughter
but
her
,
and
be
very
jealous
on
the
occasion
about
which
your
ladyship
so
kindly
reproach
me
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
pride
,
you
know
,
Madam
,
in
some
of
our
sex
,
that
serve
to
useful
purpose
,
be
a
good
defence
against
improper
match
,
and
mean
action
;
and
be
not
wholly
to
be
subdue
,
for
that
reason
;
for
,
though
it
be
not
virtue
,
yet
,
if
it
can
be
virtue
's
substitute
,
in
high
,
rash
,
and
inconsiderate
mind
,
it
;
may
turn
to
good
account
.
<EOS>
so
I
will
not
quite
discourage
my
dear
pupil
<EOS>
neither
,
till
I
see
what
discretion
,
and
riper
year
,
may
add
to
her
distinguishing
faculty
.
<EOS>
for
,
as
some
have
no
notion
of
pride
,
separate
from
imperiousness
and
arrogance
,
so
other
know
no
difference
between
humility
and
meanness
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
golden
mean
in
every
thing
;
and
if
it
please
God
to
spare
us
both
,
I
will
endeavour
to
point
her
passion
,
and
such
even
of
those
foible
,
which
seem
too
deeply
rooted
to
be
soon
eradicate
,
to
useful
purpose
;
choose
to
imitate
physician
,
who
,
in
certain
chronical
illness
,
as
I
have
read
in
Lord
Bacon
,
rather
proceed
by
palliative
,
than
by
harsh
extirpative
,
which
,
through
the
resistance
give
to
them
by
the
constitution
,
may
create
such
ferment
in
it
,
as
may
destroy
that
health
<EOS>
it
be
their
intention
to
establish
.
  
<EOS>
but
whither
be
I
run
?
 
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
I
hope
,
will
excuse
this
parade
freedom
of
my
pen
:
for
though
these
notion
be
well
enough
with
regard
to
Miss
Goodwin
,
they
must
be
very
impertinent
to
a
lady
,
who
can
so
much
well
instruct
Miss
's
tutoress
than
that
vain
tutoress
can
her
pupil

and
,
therefore
,
with
my
humble
respect
to
my

Davers

<EOS>
Miss

beg
<EOS>
I
will
send
her
duty
to

noble
uncle

that
be

ask

pretty

just
now

if
I
think
there
be
such
a
happy

I
tell

God
always
bless
good

and
make
them
happy
and
happy

<EOS>
my
dear
lady
daver
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
three
marriage
to
acquaint
you
with
,
in
one
letter
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
Sir
W.G.
have
send
,
by
the
particular
desire
of
my
dear
friend
,
that
he
be
make
one
of
the
happy
man
in
England
,
on
the
18th
past
;
and
so
I
have
no
longer
my
Miss
Darnford
to
boast
of
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
the
gentleman
;
but
if
he
be
<EOS>
but
half
so
good
a
husband
as
she
will
make
a
wife
<EOS>
,
they
will
be
exceedingly
happy
in
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Williams
's
marriage
to
a
kinswoman
of
his
noble
patron
(
as
you
have
hear
be
in
treaty
)
be
the
next
;
and
there
be
great
reason
to
believe
,
from
the
character
of
both
,
that
they
will
likewise
do
credit
to
the
state
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
be
Mr.
Adams
and
Polly
Barlow
;
and
I
wish
them
,
for
both
their
sake
,
as
happy
as
either
of
the
former
.
<EOS>
They
be
set
out
to
his
living
,
highly
pleased
with
one
another
;
and
I
hope
will
have
reason
to
continue
so
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
first
,
I
do
not
indeed
think
the
affair
would
have
be
so
soon
conclude
;
and
Miss
keep
it
off
so
long
,
as
I
understand
,
that
her
papa
be
angry
with
her
:
and
,
indeed
,
as
the
gentleman
's
family
,
circumstance
,
and
character
,
be
such
,
that
there
could
lie
no
objection
against
him
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
would
have
be
wrong
to
have
delay
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
write
to
your
ladyship
before
;
but
have
be
favour
with
Mr.
B.
's
company
into
Kent
,
on
a
visit
to
my
good
mother
,
who
be
indispose
.
<EOS>
We
tarry
there
a
week
,
and
leave
both
my
dear
parent
,
to
my
thankful
satisfaction
,
in
as
good
health
as
ever
they
be
in
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Judy
Swynford
,
or
Miss
Swynford
(
as
she
refuse
not
be
call
,
now
and
then
)
,
have
be
with
us
for
this
week
past
;
and
she
expect
her
brother
,
Sir
Jacob
,
to
fetch
her
away
in
about
a
week
hence
.
  
<EOS>
It
do
not
become
me
to
write
the
least
word
that
may
appear
disrespectful
of
any
person
related
to
your
ladyship
and
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
Otherwise
I
should
say
,
that
the
b####
and
the
s####s
be
directly
the
opposite
of
one
another
.
<EOS>
but
yet
,
as
she
never
see
your
ladyship
but
once
,
you
will
forgive
me
to
mention
a
word
or
two
about
her
,
because
she
be
a
character
that
be
in
a
manner
new
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
maiden
lady
,
as
you
know
,
and
though
she
will
not
part
with
the
green
leaf
from
her
hand
,
one
see
by
the
grey
-
goose
down
on
her
brow
and
her
head
,
that
she
can
not
be
less
than
fifty
-
five
.
<EOS>
but
so
much
pain
do
she
take
,
by
powder
,
to
have
never
a
dark
hair
in
her
head
,
because
she
have
one
half
of
them
white
,
that
I
be
sorry
to
see
,
what
be
a
subject
for
reverence
,
should
be
deem
,
by
the
good
lady
,
matter
of
concealment
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
often
seemingly
reproach
herself
,
that
she
be
an
old
maid
,
and
an
old
woman
;
but
it
be
very
discernible
,
that
she
expect
a
compliment
,
that
she
be
not
so
,
every
time
she
be
so
free
with
herself
:
and
if
nobody
make
her
one
,
she
will
say
something
of
that
sort
in
her
own
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
She
take
particular
care
,
that
of
all
the
public
transaction
which
happen
to
be
talk
of
,
her
memory
will
never
carry
her
back
above
thirty
year
!
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
 
"
about
thirty
year
ago
;
when
I
be
a
girl
,
"
or
"
when
I
be
in
hang
sleeve
;
"
and
so
she
make
herself
,
for
twenty
year
of
her
life
,
a
very
useless
and
insignificant
person
.
  
<EOS>
if
her
tooth
,
which
,
for
her
age
,
be
very
good
,
though
not
over
white
(
and
which
,
by
her
care
of
them
,
she
seem
to
look
upon
as
the
last
remain
of
her
well
day
)
,
would
but
fail
,
it
may
help
her
to
a
conviction
,
that
would
set
her
ten
year
forwarder
at
least
.
<EOS>
but
,
poor
lady
,
she
be
so
young
,
in
spite
of
her
wrinkle
,
that
I
be
really
concerned
for
her
affectation
;
because
it
expose
her
to
the
remark
and
ridicule
of
the
gentleman
,
and
give
one
pain
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
surely
,
these
lady
do
not
act
prudently
at
all
;
since
,
for
every
year
Mrs.
Judy
would
take
from
her
age
,
her
censurer
add
two
to
it
;
and
,
behind
her
back
,
make
her
go
on
towards
seventy
;
whereas
,
if
she
would
lay
claim
to
her
reverential
,
as
I
may
say
,
and
not
try
to
conceal
her
age
,
she
would
have
many
compliment
for
look
so
well
at
her
year
.
 
<EOS>
and
many
a
young
body
would
hope
to
be
the
well
for
her
advice
and
experience
,
who
now
be
afraid
of
affront
her
,
if
they
suppose
she
have
live
much
longer
in
the
world
than
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
look
back
to
the
year
she
own
,
when
more
flippant
lady
,
at
the
laugh
time
of
her
life
,
delight
to
be
frolic
:
she
try
to
sing
too
,
although
,
if
ever
she
have
a
voice
,
she
have
outlive
it
;
and
her
song
be
of
so
antique
a
date
,
that
they
would
betray
her
;
only
,
as
she
say
,
they
be
learn
her
by
her
grandmother
,
who
be
a
fine
lady
at
the
restoration
.
<EOS>
She
will
join
in
a
dance
;
and
though
her
limb
move
not
so
pliantly
as
may
be
expect
of
a
lady
no
old
than
she
would
be
think
,
and
whose
dancing
-
day
be
not
entirely
over
,
yet
that
be
owe
to
a
fall
from
her
horse
some
year
ago
,
which
,
she
doubt
,
she
shall
never
recover
,
though
she
find
she
grow
well
and
well
,
every
year
.
  
<EOS>
thus
she
lose
the
respect
,
the
reverence
,
she
may
receive
,
be
it
not
for
this
miserable
affectation
;
take
pain
,
by
ape
youth
,
to
make
herself
unworthy
of
her
year
,
and
be
content
to
be
think
less
discreet
than
she
may
otherwise
be
deem
,
for
fear
she
should
be
imagine
old
if
she
appear
wise
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
sad
thing
be
this
,
Madam
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
mistaken
conduct
!
<EOS>
We
pray
to
live
to
old
age
;
and
it
be
promise
as
a
blessing
,
and
as
a
reward
for
the
performance
of
certain
duty
;
and
yet
,
when
we
come
to
it
,
we
have
rather
be
think
as
foolish
as
youth
,
than
to
be
deem
wise
,
and
in
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
so
we
shew
how
little
we
deserve
what
we
have
be
so
long
covet
;
and
yet
covet
on
:
for
what
?
<EOS>
why
,
to
be
more
and
more
ashamed
,
and
more
and
more
unworthy
of
that
we
covet
!
  
<EOS>
how
fantastic
a
character
be
this!-Well
may
irreverent
,
unthinke
youth
despise
,
instead
of
revere
,
the
hoary
head
which
the
wearer
be
so
much
ashamed
of
.
<EOS>
the
lady
boast
a
relationship
to
you
,
and
Mr.
B.
<EOS>
and
,
I
think
,
I
be
very
bold
.
<EOS>
but
my
reverence
for
year
,
and
the
disgust
I
have
to
see
anybody
behave
unworthy
of
them
,
make
me
take
the
great
liberty
:
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
I
shall
wish
I
have
not
take
,
if
it
meet
not
with
that
allowance
,
which
I
have
always
have
from
your

in
what
I
write

<EOS>
God
know
whether
ever
I
may
enjoy
the
blessing
<EOS>
I
so
much
revere
in
other
.
<EOS>
for
now
my
heavy
time
approach
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
apprehensive
before
,
and
so
troublesome
to
my
good
friend
,
with
my
vapourish
fear
,
that
now
(
with
a
perfect
resignation
to
the
Divine
Will

I
will
only
add
,
that
I
be
your

Mr.

her
noble

be
as
worthy
a

as

I
beg
of
you
to
congratulate
the
dear

and
her
noble
parent
,
in
my
name

if
I
should
be
at
a
distance

when
the
nuptial

<EOS>
I
have
have
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
my
lady
,
the
Countess
Dowager
,
on
occasion
of
her
leave
the
kingdom
for
a
year
or
two
,
for
which
space
<EOS>
she
design
to
reside
in
Italy
,
principally
at
Naples
or
Florence
;
a
design
she
take
up
some
time
ago
,
but
which
<EOS>
it
seem
she
could
not
conveniently
put
into
execution
till
now
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
be
abroad
when
her
ladyship
come
,
and
I
expect
him
not
till
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
She
send
her
gentleman
,
the
precede
evening
,
to
let
me
know
that
business
have
bring
her
as
far
as
Wooburn
;
and
if
it
would
not
be
unacceptable
,
she
would
pay
her
respect
to
me
at
breakfast
,
the
next
morning
,
be
speedily
to
leave
England
.
<EOS>
I
return
,
that
I
should
be
very
proud
of
that
honour
.
<EOS>
and
about
ten
her
ladyship
come
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
exceedingly
fond
of
my
two
boy
,
the
little
man
,
and
the
pretty
baby
,
as
she
call
them
;
and
I
have
very
different
emotion
from
the
expression
of
her
love
to
Billy
,
and
her
visit
to
me
,
from
what
I
have
once
before
.
<EOS>
She
be
sorry
<EOS>
,
she
say
,
Mr.
B.
be
abroad
;
though
her
business
be
principally
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
for
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
come
to
tell
you
all
that
pass
between
Mr.
B.
and
myself
,
that
you
may
not
think
bad
of
either
of
us
,
than
we
deserve
;
and
I
could
not
leave
England
till
I
have
wait
on
you
for
this
purpose
;
and
yet
,
perhaps
,
from
the
distance
of
time
,
you
will
think
it
needless
now
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
should
have
wait
on
you
before
,
to
have
clear
up
my
character
with
you
,
<EOS>
have
I
think
I
should
have
be
so
long
keep
on
this
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
very
sorry
<EOS>
I
have
ever
be
uneasy
,
when
I
have
two
person
of
so
much
honour
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
she
,
interrupt
me
,
"
you
have
no
need
to
apologize
;
thing
look
bad
enough
,
as
they
be
present
to
you
,
to
justify
great
uneasiness
than
you
express
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
ask
me
,
who
that
pretty
genteel
Miss
be
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
a
relation
of
Lord
Davers
,
who
be
entrust
lately
to
my
care
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
Miss
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
and
kiss
her
,
"
you
be
very
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
believe
<EOS>
the
Countess
be
desirous
of
be
alone
with
me
,
I
say
,
"
My
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
will
not
you
go
to
your
little
nursery
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
so
she
call
my
last
blessing
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
sorry
the
baby
should
cry
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
she
be
so
take
with
the
charming
lady
,
that
she
be
loth
to
leave
us
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
my
say
this
,
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
alone
,
the
Countess
begin
her
story
,
with
a
sweet
confusion
,
which
add
to
her
loveliness
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
would
be
brief
,
because
she
should
exact
all
my
attention
,
and
not
suffer
me
to
interrupt
her
till
she
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
begin
with
acknowledge
,
that
she
think
,
when
she
first
see
Mr.
B.
at
the
masquerade
,
that
he
be
the
fine
gentleman
she
have
ever
see
;
that
the
allow
freedom
of
the
place
have
make
her
take
liberty
in
follow
him
,
and
engage
him
wherever
he
go
.
<EOS>
She
blame
him
very
freely
for
pass
for
a
single
man
;
for
that
,
she
say
,
since
she
have
so
splendid
a
fortune
of
her
own
,
be
all
she
be
solicitous
about
;
have
never
,
as
she
confess
,
see
a
man
she
could
like
so
well
;
her
former
marriage
have
be
in
some
sort
force
upon
her
,
at
an
age
when
she
know
not
how
to
distinguish
;
and
that
she
be
very
loth
to
believe
him
married
,
even
when
she
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
.
"
<EOS>
yet
this
I
must
say
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
never
hear
a
man
,
when
he
own
he
be
married
,
express
himself
with
more
affectionate
regard
and
fondness
than
he
do
of
you
;
which
make
me
long
to
see
you
;
for
I
have
a
great
opinion
of
those
personal
advantage
which
every
one
flatter
me
with
;
and
be
very
unwilling
to
yield
the
palm
of
beauty
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
will
censure
me
,
Mrs.
B.
,
for
permit
his
visit
after
I
know
he
be
married
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
that
be
a
thoughtless
,
and
a
faulty
part
of
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
but
the
world
's
saucy
censure
,
and
my
friend
'
indiscreet
interposal
,
incense
me
;
and
,
know
the
uprightness
of
my
own
heart
,
I
be
resolve
to
disgrace
both
,
when
I
find
they
could
not
think
bad
of
me
than
they
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
naturally
of
a
high
spirit
,
impatient
of
contradiction
,
always
give
myself
freedom
,
for
which
,
satisfied
with
my
own
innocence
,
I
think
myself
above
be
accountable
to
any
body
 
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
B.
have
such
noble
sentiment
,
a
courage
and
fearlessness
,
which
I
see
on
more
occasion
than
one
,
that
all
lady
who
know
the
weakness
of
their
own
sex
,
and
how
much
they
want
the
protection
of
the
brave
,
be
take
with
.
<EOS>
then
his
personal
address
be
so
peculiarly
distinguishing
,
that
have
an
opinion
of
his
honour
,
I
be
embarrassed
greatly
how
to
deny
myself
his
conversation
;
although
,
you
will
pardon
me
,
Mrs.
B.
,
I
begin
to
be
afraid
that
my
reputation
may
suffer
in
the
world
's
opinion
for
the
indulgence
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
when
I
have
resolve
,
as
I
do
several
time
,
to
see
him
no
more
,
some
unforeseen
accident
throw
him
in
my
way
again
,
at
one
entertainment
or
other
;
for
I
love
ball
and
concert
,
and
public
diversion
,
perhaps
,
well
than
I
ought
;
and
then
I
have
all
my
resolve
to
begin
again
.
<EOS>
yet
this
I
can
truly
say
,
whatever
his
view
be
,
I
never
hear
from
him
the
least
indecent
expression
,
nor
see
in
his
behaviour
to
me
much
to
apprehend
;
save
,
I
begin
to
fear
,
that
by
his
insinuate
address
,
and
noble
manner
,
I
should
be
too
much
in
his
power
,
and
too
little
in
my
own
,
if
I
go
on
so
little
doubting
,
and
so
little
alarmed
,
if
ever
he
should
avow
dishonourable
design
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
lament
,
that
our
sex
be
prohibit
,
by
the
design
of
the
other
upon
their
honour
,
and
by
the
world
's
censure
,
from
converse
with
the
same
ease
and
freedom
with
gentleman
,
as
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
and
when
once
I
ask
myself
,
to
what
this
conversation
may
tend
at
last
?
<EOS>
and
where
the
pleasure
each
seem
to
take
in
the
other
's
,
may
possibly
end
?
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
break
it
off
;
and
tell
him
my
resolution
next
time
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
stop
my
mouth
with
a
romantic
notion
,
as
I
since
think
it
,
(
though
a
sorry
plea
will
have
weight
in
favour
of
a
proposal
,
to
which
one
have
no
aversion
)
of
platonic
love
;
and
we
have
an
intercourse
by
letter
,
to
the
number
of
six
or
eight
,
I
believe
,
on
that
and
other
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
yet
all
this
time
,
I
be
the
less
apprehensive
,
because
he
always
speak
so
tenderly
,
and
even
with
delight
,
whenever
he
mention
his
lady
;
and
I
could
not
find
,
that
you
be
at
all
alarm
at
our
acquaintance
:
for
I
never
scruple
to
send
my
letter
,
by
my
own
livery
,
to
your
house
,
seal
with
my
own
seal
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
indeed
,
he
begin
to
tell
me
,
that
from
the
sweetest
and
even
temper
in
the
world
,
you
seem
to
be
lean
towards
melancholy
,
be
always
in
tear
,
or
shew
you
have
be
weep
,
when
he
come
home
;
and
that
you
do
not
make
his
return
to
you
so
agreeable
as
he
use
to
find
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
if
it
be
not
owe
to
some
alteration
in
his
own
temper
?
<EOS>
if
you
may
not
be
uneasy
at
our
acquaintance
,
and
at
his
frequent
absence
from
you
,
and
the
like
?
<EOS>
He
answer
,
no
;
that
you
be
above
disguise
,
be
of
a
noble
and
frank
nature
,
and
would
have
hint
it
to
him
,
if
you
have
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
when
I
begin
to
think
seriously
of
the
matter
,
give
me
but
little
satisfaction
;
and
I
be
more
and
more
convinced
,
that
my
honour
require
it
of
me
,
to
break
off
this
intimacy
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
although
I
permit
Mr.
B.
to
go
with
me
to
Tunbridge
,
when
I
go
to
take
a
house
there
,
yet
I
be
uneasy
,
as
he
see
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
so
be
he
,
though
he
tarry
a
day
or
two
long
than
he
design
,
on
account
of
a
little
excursion
my
sister
and
her
lord
,
and
he
and
I
,
make
into
Sussex
,
to
see
an
estate
I
think
of
purchase
;
for
he
be
so
good
as
to
look
into
my
affair
,
and
have
put
them
upon
an
admirable
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
uneasiness
,
I
find
,
be
upon
your
account
,
and
he
send
you
a
letter
to
excuse
himself
for
not
wait
on
you
on
Saturday
,
and
to
say
,
he
would
dine
with
you
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
and
I
remember
when
I
say
,
"
Mr.
B.
,
you
seem
to
be
chagrin
at
something
;
you
be
more
thoughtful
than
usual
:
"
his
answer
be
,
"
Madam
,
you
be
right
,
Mrs.
B.
and
I
have
have
a
little
misunderstanding
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
solemn
,
and
so
melancholy
of
late
<EOS>
,
I
fear
it
will
be
no
difficult
matter
to
put
her
out
of
her
right
mind
:
<EOS>
and
I
love
her
so
well
,
that
then
I
should
hardly
keep
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
be
there
no
reason
,
think
you
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
imagine
that
your
acquaintance
with
me
give
her
uneasiness
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
Mr.
B.
,
how
that
villain
T.

(
a
man
,
"
say
she
,
"
whose
insolent
address
I
reject
with
the
contempt
it
deserve

have
slander
us

<EOS>
how
know
you
,
but
he
have
find
a
way
to
your
wife
's
ear
,
as
he
have
do
to
my
uncle
's
,
and
to
all
my
friend

?
<EOS>
and
if
so
,
it
be
good
for
us
both
to
discontinue
a
friendship
,
that
may
be
attend
with
disagreeable
consequence

<EOS>

"
He
say
,
he
should
find
it
out
on
his
return

will
you
,

say
I
,
"
ingenuously
acquaint
me
with
the
issue
of
your
inquiry
?
<EOS>
for
,
"
add
I
,
"
I
never
beheld
a
countenance
,
in
so
young
a
lady
,
<EOS>
that
seem
to
mean
more
than
Mrs.
B.
's
,
when
I
see
her
in
town
;
and
notwithstanding
her
prudence
I
could
see
a
reserve
and
thoughtfulness
in
it
,
that
,
if
it
be
not
natural
to
it
,
must
indicate
too
much
.

<EOS>
"
He
write
to
me
,
in
a
very
moving
letter
,
the
issue
of
your
conference
,
and
refer
to
some
paper
of
your
'
,
that
he
would
shew
me
,
as
soon
as
he
could
procure
them
,
they
be
of
your

let
me
know
that
T.

the
accuser

as
I
have
suspect

<EOS>
"
in
brief
,
Madam
,
when
you
go
down
into
Kent
,
he
read
to
me
some
part
of
your
account
to
Lady
Davers
,
of
your
informant
and
information
;
your
apprehension
;
your
prudence
;
your
affection
for
him
;
the
reason
of
your
melancholy
;
and
,
to
all
appearance
,
reason
enough
you
have
,
especially
from
the
letter
of
Thomasine
Fuller
,
which
be
one
of
T.
's
vile
forgery
:
for
though
we
have
often
,
for
argument
's
sake
,
talk
of
polygamy
<EOS>
(
he
argue
for
it
,
I
against
it
)
,
yet
have
not
Mr.
B.
dare
,
nor
be
he
incline
,
I
verily
believe
,
to
propose
any
such
thing
to
me
:
no
,
Madam
,
I
be
not
so
much
abandon
to
a
sense
of
honour
,
as
to
give
reason
for
any
one
,
but
my
impertinent
and
foolish
uncle
,
to
impute
such
a
folly
to
me
;
and
he
have
so
behave
to
me
,
that
I
care
not
what
he
think
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
what
he
read
to
me
,
here
and
there
,
as
he
please
,
give
me
reason
to
admire
you
for
your
generous
opinion
of
one
you
have
so
much
seem
cause
<EOS>
to
be
afraid
of
<EOS>
:
he
tell
me
his
apprehension
,
from
your
uncommon
manner
,
that
your
mind
be
in
some
degree
affect
,
and
your
strange
proposal
of
part
with
a
husband
<EOS>
every
one
know
you
so
dearly
love
:
and
we
agree
to
forbear
see
each
other
,
and
all
manner
of
correspondence
,
except
by
letter
,
for
one
month
,
till
some
of
my
affair
be
settle
,
which
have
be
in
great
disorder
,
and
be
in
his
kind
management
then
;
and
I
have
not
one
relation
,
whom
I
care
to
trouble
with
them
,
because
of
their
treatment
of
me
on
Mr.
B.
's
account
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
I
tell
him
,
should
not
be
neither
,
but
through
your
hand
,
and
with
your
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
thus
,
Madam

"
say
her
ladyship
,
"
have
I
tell
you
the
naked
truth
of
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
Mr.
B.
very
seldom
since
:
and
when
I
have
,
it
have
be
either
at
a
horse
-
race
,
in
the
open
field
,
or
at
some
public
diversion
,
by
accident
,
where
only
distant
civility
have
pass
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
respect
him
greatly
;
you
must
allow
me
to
say
that
.
<EOS>
except
in
the
article
of
permit
me
to
believe
,
for
some
time
,
that
he
be
a
single
gentleman
,
a
fault
he
can
not
be
excuse
for
,
and
which
make
me
heartily
quarrel
with
him
,
when
I
first
know
it
,
he
have
behave
to
me
with
so
much
generosity
and
honour
,
that
I
could
have
wish
I
have
be
of
his
sex
,
since
he
have
a
lady
so
much
more
deserving
than
myself
;
and
then
,
have
he
have
the
same
esteem
for
me
<EOS>
,
there
never
would
have
be
a
more
perfect
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
go
,
"
continue
she
,
"
to
embark
for
France
,
and
shall
pass
a
year
or
two
in
Italy
;
and
then
I
shall
,
I
hope
,
return
as
solid
,
as
grave
,
as
circumspect
,
though
not
so
wise
,
as
Mrs.
B.
"
  
thus
the
Countess
conclude
her
narrative
:
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
be
greatly
oblige
to
her
for
the
honour
of
this
visit
,
and
the
kind
and
considerate
occasion
of
it
:
but
that
Mr.
B.
have
make
me
entirely
happy
in
every
particular
,
and
have
do
her
ladyship
the
justice
she
so
well
deserved
,
have
take
upon
himself
the
blame
of
pass
as
a
single
man
at
his
first
acquaintance
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
add
,
that
I
could
hope
her
ladyship
may
be
prevent
,
by
some
happy
man
,
from
leave
a
kingdom
,
to
which
she
be
so
great
<EOS>
an
ornament
,
as
well
by
her
birth
,
her
quality
and
fortune
,
as
by
her
perfection
of
person
and
mind
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
have
not
be
the
happy
of
her
sex
in
her
former
marriage
:
although
nobody
,
her
youth
consider
,
think
her
a
bad
wife
;
and
her
lord
's
goodness
to
her
,
at
his
death
,
have
demonstrate
his
own
favourable
opinion
of
her
by
deed
,
as
he
have
do
by
word
upon
all
occasion
:
but
that
she
be
yet
young
;
a
little
too
gay
and
unsettle
:
and
have
her
head
turn
towards
France
and
Italy
,
have
pass
some
time
in
those
country
,
which
she
think
of
with
pleasure
,
though
then
only
twelve
or
thirteen
:
that
for
this
reason
,
and
have
be
on
a
late
occasion
still
more
unsettled
(
look
down
with
blush
,
which
often
overspread
her
face
,
as
she
talk
)
<EOS>
,
she
have
refuse
some
offer
,
not
despicable
:
that
indeed
Lord
C.
threaten
to
follow
her
to
Italy
,
in
hope
of
meet
well
success
there
,
than
he
have
meet
with
here
:
but
if
he
do
,
though
she
would
make
no
resolution
,
she
may
be
too
much
offend
with
him
,
to
give
him
reason
to
boast
of
his
journey
;
and
this
the
rather
,
as
she
believe
he
have
once
entertain
no
very
honourable
notion
of
her
friendship
for
Mr.
B.
  
She
wish
to
see
Mr.
B.
and
to
take
leave
of
him
,
but
not
out
of
my
company
,
she
be
pleased
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
's
consideration
for
me
,
"
reply
I
,
"
lay
me
under
high
obligation
;
but
indeed
,
Madam
,
there
be
no
occasion
for
it
,
from
any
diffidence
I
have
in
your
's
or
Mr.
B.
's
honour
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
of
know
when
it
will
be
most
acceptable
,
I
will
beg
of
Mr.
B.
to
oblige
me
with
his
company
to
return
this
favour
,
the
first
visit
I
make
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
say
she
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
to
go
to
Tunbridge
for
a
fortnight
,
when
I
have
dispose
of
every
thing
for
my
embarkation
,
and
so
set
out
from
thence
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
should
then
be
both
in
Kent
,
I
should
be
glad
to
take
you
at
your
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
say
,
Mr.
B.
at
least
,
would
attend
her
ladyship
there
,
if
any
thing
should
happen
to
deprive
me
of
that
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
obliging
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
take
great
concern
to
myself
,
for
have
cause
you
a
moment
's
uneasiness
formerly
:
but
I
must
now
try
to
be
circumspect
,
in
order
to
retrieve
my
character
,
which
have
be
so
basely
traduce
by
that
presumptuous
fellow
Turner
,
who
hope
,
I
suppose
,
by
that
mean
,
to
bring
me
down
to
his
level
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
would
not
be
prevail
upon
to
stay
dinner
;
and
,
say
she
would
be
at
Wooburn
all
the
next
day
,
take
a
very
tender
leave
of
me
,
wish
me
all
manner
of
happiness
,
as
I
do
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
come
home
in
the
evening
,
and
next
morning
ride
to
Wooburn
,
to
pay
his
respect
to
the
Countess
,
and
come
back
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
thus
happily
,
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
three
,
as
I
hope
,
end
this
perplex
affair
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
ask
me
how
I
relish
Mr.
Locke
's
Treatise
on
Education
?
<EOS>
which
he
put
into
my
hand
some
time
since
,
as
I
tell
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
very
well
;
and
I
think
it
an
excellent
piece
in
the
main
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
you
shall
do
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
shew
me
any
thing
you
have
write
for
a
good
while
.
<EOS>
I
could
wish
you
to
fill
up
your
leisure
-
time
with
your
observation
on
that
treatise
,
that
I
may
know
what
you
can
object
to
it
;
for
you
say
in
the
main
,
which
shew
,
that
you
do
not
entirely
approve
of
every
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
will
not
that
be
presumptuous
,
Sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
admire
Mr.
Locke
,
"
reply
he
;
"
and
I
admire
my
Pamela
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
of
his
excellency
,
but
I
want
to
know
the
sentiment
of
a
young
mother
,
as
well
as
of
a
learn
gentleman
,
upon
the
subject
of
education
;
because
I
have
hear
several
lady
censure
some
part
of
his
regiman
,
when
I
be
convince
,
that
the
fault
lie
in
their
own
over
-
great
fondness
for
their
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
myself
,
Sir
,
who
,
in
the
early
part
of
my
life
,
have
not
be
bring
up
too
tenderly
,
you
will
hardly
meet
with
any
objection
to
the
part
which
I
imagine
you
have
hear
most
object
to
by
lady
who
have
be
more
indulgently
treat
in
their
first
stage
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
few
other
thing
that
want
clear
up
to
my
understanding
;
but
,
which
,
however
,
may
be
the
fault
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
suppose
me
at
a
distance
from
you

can
not
you
give
me
your
remark
in
the
same
manner

as
if
you
be
write
to
Lady
Davers
,
or
to
Miss
Darnford

that
be

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Sir

depend
on
your
kind
favour
to
me
,
I
believe
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
then
;
and
the
less
restraint
you
write
with
,
the
more
I
shall
be
pleased
with
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
confine
you
not
to
time
or
place
.
<EOS>
We
will
make
our
excursion
as
I
once
propose
;
and
do
you
write
to
me
now
-
and
-
then
upon
the
subject
;
for
the
place
and
remarkable
you
will
see
,
will
be
new
only
to
yourself
;
nor
will
either
of
those
lady

let
your

require
no

for
I
know
,
in

natural

that
would
be
a
confinement

would
cramp
your
genius

give
what
you

a
stiff

formal

<EOS>
well

P.B.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr.
B.
,
  
I
have
be
consider
of
your
command
,
in
relation
to
Mr.
Locke
's
book
,
and
since
you
be
pleased
to
give
me
time
to
acquit
myself
of
the
task
,
I
shall
beg
to
include
in
a
little
book
my
humble
sentiment
,
as
I
do
to
Lady
Davers
,
<EOS>
in
that
I
shew
you
in
relation
to
the
play
I
have
see
.
<EOS>
and
since
you
confine
me
not
to
time
or
place
,
I
may
be
three
or
four
year
in
complete
it
,
because
I
shall
reserve
some
subject
to
my
further
experience
in
child
's
way
and
temper
,
and
in
order
to
benefit
myself
by
the
good
instruction
I
shall
receive
from
your
delightful
conversation
,
in
that
compass
of
time
,
if
God
spare
us
to
one
another
:
and
then
it
will
,
moreover
,
be
still
worthy
of
the
perusal
of
the
most
honoured
and
best
beloved
of
all
my
correspondent
,
much
honoured
and
belove
as
they
all
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
needs
say
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
that
this
be
a
subject
to
which
I
be
always
particularly
attentive
;
and
among
the
charity
your
bountiful
heart
permit
me
to
dispense
to
the
poor
and
indigent
,
I
have
have
always
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
child
of
such
,
and
endeavour
,
by
question
put
to
them
,
as
well
as
to
their
parent
,
to
inform
myself
of
their
little
way
and
temper
,
and
how
nature
delight
to
work
in
different
mind
,
and
how
it
may
be
point
to
their
good
,
accord
to
their
respective
capacity
;
and
I
have
for
this
purpose
erect
,
with
your
approbation
,
a
little
school
of
seven
or
eight
child
,
among
which
be
four
in
the
early
stage
,
when
they
can
but
just
speak
,
and
call
for
what
they
want
and
love
:
<EOS>
and
I
be
not
a
little
pleased
to
observe
,
when
I
visit
them
in
their
school
time
that
principle
of
goodness
and
virtue
may
be
instill
into
their
little
heart
much
earlier
than
be
usually
imagine
.
<EOS>
and
why
should
it
not
be
so
?
<EOS>
for
may
not
the
child
,
that
can
tell
its
want
,
and
make
know
its
inclination
,
be
easily
make
sensible
of
yours
,
and
what
you
expect
from
it
,
provide
you
take
a
proper
method
?
<EOS>
for
,
sometimes
,
sign
and
token
(
and
even
look
)
,
uniformly
practise
,
will
do
as
well
as
word
;
as
we
see
in
such
of
the
young
of
the
brute
creation
as
we
be
dispose
to
domesticate
,
and
to
teach
to
practise
those
little
trick
,
of
which
the
aptness
or
docility
of
their
nature
make
them
capable
.
  
<EOS>
but
yet
,
dear
Sir
,
I
know
not
enough
of
the
next
stage
,
the
maturer
part
of
life
,
to
touch
upon
that
as
I
wish
to
do
:
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
a
natural
connection
and
progression
from
the
one
to
the
other
:
and
I
would
not
be
think
a
vain
creature
,
who
believe
herself
equal
to
every
subject
,
because
she
be
indulge
with
the
good
opinion
of
her
friend
,
in
a
few
,
which
be
suppose
to
be
within
her
own
capacity
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
that
it
be
no
small
point
of
wisdom
to
know
,
and
not
to
mistake
,
one
's
own
talent
:
<EOS>
and
for
this
reason
,
permit
me
,
Sir
,
to
suspend
,
till
I
be
better
qualified
for
it
,
even
my
own
proposal
of
begin
my
little
book
;
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
to
touch
upon
a
few
place
of
the
admirable
author
,
that
seem
to
me
to
warrant
another
way
of
thinking
,
than
that
which
he
prescribe
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Sir
,
let
me
premise
,
that
all
that
your
dear
baby
can
demand
of
my
attention
for
some
time
to
come
,
be
their
health
;
and
God
have
bless
them
with
such
sound
limb
,
and
,
to
all
appearance
,
good
constitution
,
that
I
have
very
little
to
do
,
but
to
pray
for
them
every
time
I
pray
for
their
dear
papa
;
and
that
be
hourly
;
and
yet
not
so
often
as
you
confer
upon
me
benefit
and
favour
,
and
new
obligation
,
even
to
the
prevention
of
all
my
wish
,
be
I
to
sit
down
and
study
for
what
must
be
the
next
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
this
point
of
health
,
Mr.
Locke
give
these
plain
and
easy
to
be
observe
rule
.
  
<EOS>
He
prescribe
first
,
plenty
of
open
air
.
<EOS>
that
this
be
right
,
the
infant
will
inform
one
,
who
,
though
it
can
not
speak
,
will
make
sign
to
be
carry
abroad
,
and
be
never
so
well
pleased
,
as
when
enjoy
the
open
and
free
air
;
for
which
reason
I
conclude
,
that
this
be
one
of
those
natural
pointing
,
as
I
may
say
,
that
be
implant
in
every
creature
,
teach
it
to
choose
its
good
,
and
to
avoid
its
evil
.
  
<EOS>
sleep
be
the
next
,
which
he
enjoin
to
be
indulge
to
its
utmost
extent
:
an
admirable
rule
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
;
since
sound
sleep
be
one
of
the
great
nourisher
of
nature
,
both
to
the
once
young
and
to
the
twice
young
,
if
I
may
use
the
phrase
.
<EOS>
and
I
the
rather
approve
of
this
rule
,
because
it
keep
the
nurse
unemployed
,
who
otherwise
may
be
do
it
the
great
mischief
,
by
cram
and
stuff
its
little
bowel
,
till
ready
to
burst
.
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
be
right
,
what
an
inconsiderate
and
foolish
,
as
well
as
pernicious
practice
it
be
,
for
a
nurse
to
waken
the
child
from
its
nourish
sleep
,
for
fear
it
should
suffer
by
hunger
,
and
instantly
pop
the
breast
into
its
pretty
mouth
,
or
provoke
it
to
feed
,
when
it
have
no
inclination
to
either
,
and
for
want
of
digestion
,
must
have
its
nutriment
turn
to
repletion
,
and
bad
humour
!
  
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
dear
Sir
,
these
less
particular
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
begin
with
them
;
and
surely
they
may
be
allow
in
a
young
mamma
,
write
(
however
it
be
to
a
gentleman
of
genius
and
learning
)
to
a
papa
,
on
a
subject
,
that
in
its
low
beginning
ought
not
to
be
unattende
to
by
either
.
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
pursue
my
excellent
author
without
farth
apology
,
since
you
have
put
his
work
into
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
thing
,
then
,
which
he
prescribe
,
be
plain
diet
.
<EOS>
this
speak
for
itself
,
for
the
baby
can
have
no
corrupt
taste
to
gratify
:
all
be
pure
,
as
out
of
the
hand
of
nature
;
and
what
be
not
plain
and
natural
,
must
vitiate
and
offend
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
no
wine
,
or
strong
drink
.
<EOS>
equally
just
;
and
for
the
same
reason
.
  
<EOS>
little
or
no
physic
.
<EOS>
undoubtedly
right
.
<EOS>
for
the
use
of
physic
,
without
necessity
,
or
by
way
of
precaution
,
as
some
call
it
,
beget
the
necessity
of
physic
;
and
the
very
word
suppose
distemper
or
disorder
;
and
where
there
be
none
,
would
a
parent
beget
one
;
or
,
by
frequent
use
,
render
the
salutary
force
of
medicine
ineffectual
,
when
it
be
want
?
  
<EOS>
next
,
he
forbid
too
warm
and
too
strait
clothing
.
<EOS>
this
be
just
as
I
wish
it
.
<EOS>
how
often
have
my
heart
ache
,
when
I
have
see
poor
baby
roll
and
swathe
,
<EOS>
ten
or
a
dozen
time
round
;
then
blanket
upon
blanket
,
mantle
upon
that
;
its
little
neck
pin
down
to
one
posture
;
its
head
,
more
than
it
frequently
need
,
triple
-
crown
like
a
young
pope
,
with
cover
upon
cover
;
its
leg
and
arm
,
as
if
to
prevent
that
kindly
stretch
,
which
we
rather
ought
to
promote
,
when
it
be
in
health
,
and
which
be
only
aim
at
growth
and
enlargement
,
the
former
bundle
up
,
the
latter
pin
down
;
and
how
the
poor
thing
lie
on
the
nurse
's
lap
,
a
miserable
little
pinion
captive
,
goggling
and
stare
with
its
eye
,
the
only
organ
it
have
at
liberty
,
as
if
supplicate
for
freedom
to
its
fettered
limb
!
<EOS>
nor
have
it
any
comfort
at
all
,
till
with
a
sigh
or
two
,
like
a
die
deer
,
it
drop
asleep
;
and
happy
then
will
it
be
till
the
officious
nurse
's
care
shall
awaken
it
for
its
undesired
food
,
as
if
resolve
to
try
its
constitution
,
and
willing
to
see
how
many
difficulty
it
could
overcome
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
advise
,
that
the
head
and
foot
should
be
keep
cold
;
and
the
latter
often
use
to
cold
water
,
and
expose
to
wet
,
in
order
to
lay
the
foundation
,
as
he
say
,
of
an
healthy
and
hardy
constitution
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
,
what
a
pleasure
<EOS>
it
be
to
your
Pamela
,
that
her
notion
,
and
her
practice
too
,
fall
in
so
exactly
with
this
learn
gentleman
's
advice
that
,
except
one
article
,
which
be
,
that
your
Billy
have
not
yet
be
accustomed
to
be
wet
-
shod
,
every
other
particular
have
be
observe
!
<EOS>
and
do
not
you
see
what
a
charming
,
charm
baby
he
be
?
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
and
so
be
your
little
daver
,
for
his
age
 
pretty
soul
!
  
<EOS>
perhaps
some
,
be
they
to
see
this
,
would
not
be
so
ready
,
as
I
know
you
will
be
,
to
excuse
me
;
and
would
be
apt
to
say
,
"
what
nursery
impertinence
be
these
to
trouble
a
man
with
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
with
all
their
wisdom
,
they
would
be
mistake
;
for
if
a
child
have
not
good
health
,
(
and
be
not
these
rule
the
moral
foundation
,
as
I
may
say
,
of
that
blessing
?
)
<EOS>
its
animal
organ
will
play
but
poorly
in
a
weak
or
crazy
case
.
<EOS>
these
,
therefore
,
be
necessary
rule
to
be
observe
for
the
first
two
or
three
year
:
for
then
the
little
bud
of
their
mind
will
begin
to
open
,
and
their
watchful
mamma
will
be
employ
like
a
skilful
gardener
,
in
assist
and
encourage
the
charming
flower
through
its
several
hopeful
stage
to
perfection
,
when
it
shall
become
one
of
the
principal
ornament
of
that
delicate
garden
,
your
honour
family
.
<EOS>
pardon
me
,
Sir
,
if
in
the
above
paragraph
I
be
too
figurative
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
afraid
I
be
out
of
my
sphere
,
write
to
your
dear
self
,
on
these
important
subject
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
I
will
here
put
an
end
to
this
my
first
letter
(
on
the
early
part
of
my
subject
)
,
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
you
have
give
me
of
produce
a
fresh
instance
of
that
duty
and
affection
,
wherewith
I
be
,
and
shall
ever
be
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
your
grateful
,
happy
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
    
I
will
now
,
my
dear
,
my
good
beloved
correspondent
of
all
,
begin
,
since
the
tender
age
of
my
dear
baby
will
not
permit
me
to
have
an
eye
yet
to
their
well
part
,
to
tell
you
what
be
the
little
matter
to
which
I
be
not
quite
so
well
reconcile
in
Mr.
Locke
:
and
this
I
shall
be
better
enable
to
do
,
by
my
observation
upon
the
temper
and
natural
bent
of
my
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
as
well
as
by
those
which
my
visit
to
the
big
child
of
my
little
school
,
and
those
at
the
cottage
adjacent
,
have
enable
me
to
make
;
for
human
nature
,
Sir
,
you
be
not
to
be
tell
,
be
human
nature
,
whether
in
the
high
-
bear
,
or
in
the
low
.
  
<EOS>
this
excellent
author
(
section
52
)
,
have
justly
disallow
of
slavish
and
corporal
punishment
in
the
education
of
those
we
would
have
to
be
wise
,
good
,
and
ingenuous
man
,
add
,
"
on
the
other
side
,
to
flatter
child
by
reward
of
thing
that
be
pleasant
to
them
,
be
as
carefully
to
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
He
that
will
give
his
son
apple
,
or
sugar
-
plum
,
or
what
else
of
this
kind
<EOS>
he
be
most
delighted
with
,
to
make
him
learn
his
book
,
do
but
authorize
his
love
of
pleasure
,
and
cocker
up
that
dangerous
propensity
,
which
he
ought
,
by
all
mean
,
to
subdue
and
stifle
in
him
.
<EOS>
You
can
never

his

by
the

you

it

a
good

<EOS>
this
,
Sir
,
be
well
say
;
but
be
it
not
a
little
too
philosophical
and
abstract
,
not
only
for
the
generality
of
child
,
but
for
the
age
he
suppose
them
to
be
of
,
if
one
may
guess
by
the
apple
and
the
sugar
-
plum
propose
for
the
reward
of
their
well
-
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Would
not
this
require
that
memory
or
reflection
in
child
,
which
,
in
another
place
,
be
call
the
concomitant
of
prudence
and
age
,
and
not
of
childhood
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
undoubtedly
very
right
,
to
check
an
unreasonable
appetite
,
and
that
at
its
first
appearance
.
<EOS>
but
if
so
small
and
so
reasonable
an
inducement
will
prevail
,
surely
,
Sir
,
it
may
be
comply
with
.
<EOS>
a
generous
mind
take
delight
to
win
over
other
by
good
usage
and
mildness
,
rather
than
by
severity
;
and
it
must
be
a
great
pain
to
such
an
one
,
to
be
always
inculcate
,
on
his
child
or
pupil
,
the
doctrine
of
self
-
denial
,
by
method
quite
grievous
to
his
own
nature
.
  
<EOS>
what
I
would
then
humbly
propose
,
be
,
that
the
encouragement
offer
to
youth
,
should
,
indeed
,
be
innocent
one
,
as
the
gentleman
enjoin
,
and
not
such
as
would
lead
to
luxury
,
either
of
food
or
apparel
;
but
I
humbly
think
it
necessary
,
that
reward
,
proper
reward
,
should
be
propose
as
incentive
to
laudable
action
:
for
be
it
not
by
this
method
that
the
whole
world
be
influence
and
govern
?
<EOS>
do
not
God
himself
,
by
reward
and
punishment
,
make
it
our
interest
,
as
well
as
our
duty
,
to
obey
him
?
<EOS>
and
can
we
propose
ourselves
,
for
the
government
of
our
child
,
a
well
example
than
that
of
the
Creator
?
  
<EOS>
this
fine
author
seem
to
think
he
have
be
a
little
of
the
strict
,
and
liable
to
some
exception
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
not
this
,
"
proceed
he
,
(
section
53
)
"
that
I
would
have
child
keep
from
the
convenience
or
pleasure
of
life
,
that
be
not
injurious
to
their
health
or
virtue
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
would
have
their
life
make
as
pleasant
and
as
agreeable
to
them
as
may
be
,
in
a
plentiful
enjoyment
of
whatsoever
may
innocently
delight
them
.
<EOS>
"-And
<EOS>
yet
he
immediately
subjoin
a
very
hard
and
difficult
proviso
to
this
indulgence
.
 
<EOS>
"
provide
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
with
this
caution
,
that
they
have
those
enjoyment
only
as
the
consequence
of
the
state
of
esteem
and
acceptation
they
be
in
with
their
parent
and
governor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
this
be
expect
such
a
distinction
and
discretion
in
child
,
as
they
seldom
have
in
their
tender
year
,
and
require
capacity
not
commonly
to
be
meet
with
;
so
that
it
be
not
prescribe
to
the
generality
,
as
this
excellent
author
intend
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
next
to
impossible
that
their
tender
mind
should
distinguish
beyond
fact
;
they
covet
this
or
that
play
-
thing
,
and
the
parent
,
or
governor
,
take
advantage
of
its
desire
,
and
annexe
to
the
indulgence
such
or
such
a
task
or
duty
,
as
a
condition
;
and
shew
himself
please
with
its
compliance
with
it
:
so
the
child
win
its
plaything
,
and
receive
the
commendation
so
necessary
to
lead
on
young
mind
to
laudable
pursuit
.
<EOS>
but
shall
it
not
be
suffer
to
enjoy
the
innocent
reward
of
its
compliance
,
unless
it
can
give
satisfaction
,
that
its
great
delight
be
not
in
have
the
thing
covet
,
but
in
perform
the
task
,
or
obey
the
injunction
impose
upon
it
as
a
condition
of
its
be
oblige
?
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
Sir
,
this
be
a
little
too
strict
,
and
not
to
be
expect
from
child
.
<EOS>
a
servant
,
full
-
grown
,
would
not
be
able
to
shew
,
that
,
on
condition
he
comply
with
such
and
such
term
(
which
,
it
be
to
be
suppose
by
the
offer
,
he
would
not
have
comply
with
,
but
for
that
inducement
)
,
he
should
have
such
and
such
a
reward
;
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
he
would
hardly
be
able
to
shew
,
that
he
prefer
the
pleasure
of
perform
the
requisite
condition
to
the
stipulated
reward
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
necessary
he
should
:
for
he
be
not
the
less
a
good
servant
,
or
a
virtuous
man
,
if
he
own
the
condition
painful
,
and
the
reward
necessary
to
his
low
state
in
the
world
,
and
that
otherwise
he
would
not
undergo
any
service
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
should
this
be
exact
from
a
child
?
  
<EOS>
let
,
therefore
,
innocent
reward
be
propose
,
and
let
us
be
content
to
lead
on
the
ductile
mind
of
child
to
a
love
of
their
duty
,
by
oblige
them
with
such
:
we
may
tell
them
what
we
expect
in
this
case
;
but
we
ought
not
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
to
be
too
rigorous
in
exact
it
;
for
,
after
all
,
the
inducement
will
naturally
be
the
uppermost
consideration
with
the
child
:
not
,
as
I
hint
,
have
it
be
offer
to
it
,
if
the
parent
himself
have
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
and
,
therefore
,
we
can
only
let
the
child
know
his
duty
in
this
respect
,
and
that
he
ought
to
give
a
preference
to
that
;
and
then
rest
ourselves
content
,
although
we
should
discern
,
that
the
reward
be
the
chief
incentive
,
of
it
.
<EOS>
for
this
,
from
whatever
motive
inculcate
,
may
beget
a
habit
in
the
child
of
do
it
:
and
then
,
as
it
improve
in
year
,
one
may
hope
,
that
reason
will
take
place
,
and
enable
him
,
from
the
most
solid
and
durable
motive
,
to
give
a
preference
to
the
duty
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
then
,
can
we
insist
upon
it
,
that
the
child
should
so
nicely
distinguish
away
its
little
innate
passion
,
as
if
we
expect
it
to
be
bear
a
philosopher
?
<EOS>
self
-
denial
be
,
indeed
,
a
most
excellent
doctrine
to
be
inculcate
into
child
,
and
it
must
be
do
early
:
but
we
must
not
be
too
severe
in
our
exact
it
;
for
a
duty
too
rigidly
insist
upon
,
will
make
it
odious
.
<EOS>
this
Mr.
Locke
,
too
,
observe
in
another
place
,
on
the
head
of
too
great
severity
;
which
he
illustrate
by
a
familiar
comparison
:
"
offensive
circumstance
,
"
say
he
,
"
ordinarily
infect
innocent
thing
which
they
be
join
with
.
<EOS>
and
the
very
sight
of
a
cup
,
wherein
any
one
use
to
take
nauseous
physic
,
turn
his
stomach
;
so
that
nothing
will
relish
well
out
of
it
,
though
the
cup
be
never
so
clean
and
well
-
shape
,
and
of
the
rich
material
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
permit
me
to
add
,
that
Mr.
Locke
write
still
more
rigorously
on
the
subject
of
reward
;
which
I
quote
,
to
shew
I
have
not
misunderstood
him
:
"
but
these
enjoyment
,
"
say
he
,
"
should
never
be
offer
or
bestow
on
child
,
as
the
reward
of
this
or
that
particular
performance
that
they
shew
an
aversion
to
,
or
to
which
they
would
not
have
apply
themselves
without
that
temptation
.
<EOS>
"
if
,
dear
Sir
,
the
mind
of
child
can
be
lead
on
by
innocent
inducement
to
the
performance
of
a
duty
,
of
which
they
be
capable
,
what
I
have
humbly
offer
,
be
enough
,
I
presume
,
to
convince
one
,
that
it
may
be
do
.
<EOS>
but
if
ever
a
particular
study
be
propose
to
be
master
,
or
a
bias
to
be
overcome
(
that
be
not
an
indispensable
requisite
to
his
future
life
of
moral
)
to
which
the
child
shew
an
aversion
,
I
would
not
,
methink
,
have
him
be
too
much
tempt
or
compel
to
conquer
or
subdue
it
,
especially
if
it
appear
to
be
a
natural
or
rivette
aversion
.
<EOS>
for
,
permit
me
to
observe
,
that
the
education
and
study
of
child
ought
,
as
much
as
possible
,
to
be
suit
to
their
capacity
and
inclination
,
and
,
by
these
mean
,
we
may
expect
to
have
always
useful
and
often
great
man
,
in
different
profession
;
for
that
genius
which
do
not
prompt
to
the
prosecution
of
one
study
,
may
shine
in
another
no
less
necessary
part
of
science
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
the
promise
of
innocent
reward
would
conquer
this
aversion
,
yet
they
should
not
be
apply
with
this
view
;
for
the
good
consequence
that
can
be
hope
for
,
will
be
tolerable
skill
in
one
thing
,
instead
of
most
excellent
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
must
repeat
,
that
if
,
as
the
child
grow
up
,
and
be
capable
of
so
much
reason
,
that
,
from
the
love
of
the
inducement
,
one
can
raise
his
mind
to
the
love
of
the
duty
,
it
should
be
do
by
all
mean
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
I
be
afraid
that
that
parent
or
tutor
will
meet
with
but
<EOS>
little
success
,
who
,
in
a
child
's
tender
year
,
shall
refuse
to
comply
with
its
foible
,
till
he
see
it
value
its
duty
,
and
the
pleasure
of
obey
his
command
,
beyond
the
little
enjoyment
on
which
his
heart
be
fix
.
<EOS>
for
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
,
that
mind
which
can
be
bring
to
prefer
its
duty
to
its
appetite
,
will
want
little
of
the
perfection
of
the
wise
philosopher
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
Sir
,
permit
to
me
say
,
that
I
be
afraid
this
perpetual
opposition
between
the
passion
of
the
child
and
the
duty
to
be
enforce
,
especially
when
it
see
how
other
child
be
indulge
<EOS>
(
for
if
this
regiman
could
be
observe
by
any
,
it
would
be
impossible
it
should
become
general
,
while
the
fond
and
the
inconsiderate
parent
be
so
large
a
part
of
mankind
)
,
will
cow
and
dispirit
a
child
,
and
will
,
perhaps
produce
,
a
necessity
of
make
use
of
severity
,
to
subdue
him
to
this
temper
of
self
-
denial
;
for
if
the
child
refuse
,
the
parent
must
insist
;
and
what
will
be
the
consequence
?
<EOS>
must
it
not
introduce
a
harsh
discipline
than
this
gentleman
allow
of
?
 
<EOS>
and
which
,
I
presume
to
say
,
do
never
yet
do
good
to
any
but
to
slavish
and
base
spirit
,
if
to
them
;
a
discipline
which
Mr.
Locke
every
where
justly
condemn
.
  
<EOS>
see
here
,
dear
Sir
,
a
speciman
of
the
presumption
of
your
girl
:
"
what
will
she
come
to
in
time
!
<EOS>
"
you
will
perhaps
say
,
"
Her
next
step
will
be
to
arraign
myself
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
dear
Sir
,
do
not
think
so
:
for
my
duty
,
my
love
,
and
my
reverence
,
shall
be
your
guard
,
and
defend
you
from
every
thing
saucy
in
me
,
but
the
bold
approach
of
my
gratitude
,
winch
shall
always
testify
for
me
,
how
much
I
be
your
obliged
and
dutiful
servant
,
  
P.B.
    
my
DEAREST
MR
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
I
will
continue
my
subject
,
although
I
have
not
have
an
opportunity
to
know
whether
you
approve
of
my
notion
or
not
by
reason
of
the
excursion
you
have
be
pleased
to
allow
me
to
make
in
your
beloved
company
to
the
sea
-
port
of
this
kingdom
,
and
to
the
more
noted
inland
town
of
Essex
,
Kent
,
Sussex
,
Hampshire
,
and
Dorsetshire
,
which
have
give
me
infinite
delight
and
pleasure
,
and
enlarge
my
notion
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
kingdom
,
in
which
God
's
goodness
have
give
you
so
considerable
a
stake
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
topic
will
be
upon
a
home
education
,
which
Mr.
Locke
prefer
,
for
several
weighty
reason
,
to
a
school
one
,
provide
such
a
tutor
can
be
procure
,
as
he
make
next
to
an
impossibility
to
procure
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
set
forth
the
inconveniencie
of
both
,
and
be
himself
so
discouraged
,
on
a
review
of
them
,
that
he
be
ready
,
as
he
say
,
to
throw
up
his
pen
.
<EOS>
My
chief
care
,
dear
Sir
,
on
this
head
,
be
three
<EOS>
:
1st
,
the
difficulty
which
,
as
I
say
,
Mr.
Locke
make
almost
insuperable
,
to
find
a
qualified
tutor
.
<EOS>
2ndly
,
the
necessity
there
be
,
accord
to
Mr.
Locke
,
of
keep
the
youth
out
of
the
company
of
the
mean
servant
,
who
may
set
him
bad
example
.
<EOS>
and
,
3rdly
,
those
still
great
difficulty
which
will
arise
from
the
example
of
his
parent
,
if
they
be
not
very
discreet
and
circumspect
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
qualification
of
the
tutor
,
Mr.
Locke
suppose
,
that
he
be
to
be
so
learn
,
so
discreet
,
so
wise
,
in
short
,
so
perfect
a
man
,
that
I
doubt
,
and
so
do
Mr.
Locke
,
such
an
one
can
hardly
be
meet
with
for
this
humble
and
slavish
employment
.
<EOS>
I
presume
,
Sir
,
to
call
it
so
,
because
of
the
too
little
regard
that
be
generally
pay
to
these
useful
man
in
the
family
of
the
great
,
where
they
be
frequently
put
upon
a
foot
with
the
uppermost
servant
,
and
the
rather
,
if
they
happen
to
be
man
of
modesty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
"
say
he
,
"
from
child
's
first
beginning
to
talk
,
have
some
discreet
,
sober
,
nay
,
wise
person
about
them
,
whose
care
it
should
be
to
fashion
them
right
,
and
to
keep
them
from
all
ill
;
especially
the
infection
of
bad
company
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
province
require
great
sobriety
,
temperance
,
tenderness
,
diligence
,
and
discretion
;
quality
hardly
to
be
find
united
in
person
that
be
to
be
have
for
ordinary
salary
,
nor
easily
to
be
find
any
where
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
this
,
Sir
,
be
the
case
,
do
not
this
excellent
author
recommend
a
scheme
that
be
render
in
a
manner
impracticable
from
this
difficulty
?
  
<EOS>
as
to
these
quality
be
more
rarely
to
be
meet
with
in
person
that
be
to
be
have
for
ordinary
salary
,
I
can
not
help
be
of
opinion
(
although
,
with
Mr.
Locke
,
I
think
no
expence
should
be
spare
,
if
that
would
do
)
that
there
be
as
good
a
chance
for
find
a
proper
person
among
the
needy
scholars
(
if
not
of
a
low
and
sordid
turn
of
mind
)
<EOS>
as
among
the
more
affluent
:
because
the
narrow
circumstance
of
the
former
(
which
probably
become
a
spur
to
his
own
improvement
)
will
,
it
be
likely
,
at
first
set
out
in
the
world
,
make
him
be
glad
to
embrace
such
an
offer
in
a
family
which
have
interest
enough
to
prefer
him
,
and
will
quicken
his
diligence
to
make
him
deserve
preferment
;
and
if
such
an
one
want
any
of
that
requisite
politeness
,
which
some
would
naturally
expect
from
scholar
of
well
fortune
,
may
not
that
be
supply
to
the
youth
by
the
conversation
of
parent
,
relation
,
and
visitor
,
in
conjunction
with
those
other
help
which
young
man
of
family
and
large
expectation
constantly
have
,
and
which
few
learned
tutor
can
give
him
?
  
<EOS>
I
say
not
this
to
countenance
the
wretched
niggardliness
(
which
this
gentleman
justly
censure
)
of
those
who
grudge
a
handsome
consideration
to
so
necessary
and
painful
a
labour
as
that
of
a
tutor
,
which
,
where
a
deserve
man
can
be
meet
with
,
can
not
be
too
genteelly
reward
,
nor
himself
too
respectfully
treat
.
<EOS>
I
only
beg
to
deliver
my
opinion
,
that
a
low
condition
be
as
likely
as
any
other
,
with
a
mind
not
ungenerous
,
to
produce
a
man
who
have
these
good
quality
,
as
well
for
the
reason
I
have
hint
at
,
as
for
other
which
may
be
mention
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Locke
thus
proceed
:
"
to
form
a
young
gentleman
as
he
should
be
,
'
tis
fit
his
governor
should
be
well
breed
,
understand
the
way
of
carriage
,
and
measure
of
civility
,
in
all
the
variety
of
person
,
time
,
and
place
and
keep
his
pupil
,
as
far
as
his
age
require
,
constantly
to
the
observation
of
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
art
not
to
be
learn
or
teach
by
book
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
can
give
it
but
good
company
and
observation
join
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
in
another
place
say
,
"
besides
be
well
-
breed
,
the
tutor
should
know
the
world
well
;
the
way
,
the
humour
,
the
folly
,
the
cheat
,
the
fault
of
the
age
he
have
fall
into
,
and
particularly
of
the
country
he
live
in
:
these
he
should
be
able
to
shew
to
his
pupil
,
as
he
find
him
capable
;
teach
him
skill
in
man
and
their
manner
;
pull
off
the
mask
which
their
several
calling
and
pretence
cover
them
with
;
and
make
his
pupil
discern
what
lie
at
the
bottom
,
under
such
appearance
,
that
he
may
not
,
as
unexperience
young
man
be
apt
to
do
,
if
they
be
unwarned
,
take
one
thing
for
another
,
judge
by
the
outside
,
and
give
himself
up
to
show
,
and
the
insinuation
of
a
fair
carriage
,
or
an
obliging
application
;
teach
him
to
guess
at
,
and
beware
of
,
the
design
of
man
he
hath
to
do
with
,
neither
with
too
much
suspicion
,
nor
too
much
confidence
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
,
dear
Sir
,
be
excellently
say
:
'
tis
noble
theory
;
and
if
the
tutor
be
a
man
void
of
resentment
and
caprice
,
and
will
not
be
govern
by
partial
consideration
,
in
his
own
judgment
of
person
and
thing
,
all
will
be
well
:
<EOS>
but
if
otherwise
,
may
he
not
take
advantage
of
the
confidence
place
in
him
,
to
the
injury
of
some
worthy
person
,
and
by
degree
monopolize
the
young
gentleman
to
himself
,
and
govern
his
passion
as
absolutely
,
as
I
have
hear
some
first
minister
have
do
those
of
their
prince
,
equally
to
his
own
personal
disreputation
,
and
to
the
disadvantage
of
his
people
?
<EOS>
but
all
this
,
and
much
more
,
accord
to
Mr.
Locke
,
be
the
duty
of
a
tutor
:
and
on
the
finding
out
such
an
one
,
depend
his
scheme
of
a
home
education
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
,
then
,
that
he
himself
say
,
"
when
I
consider
the
scruple
and
caution
I
here
lie
in
your
way
,
methink
it
look
as
if
I
advise
you
to
something
which
I
would
have
offer
at
,
but
in
effect
not
do
,
"
&
c.
 
permit
me
,
dear
Sir
,
in
this
place
to
express
my
fear
that
it
be
hardly
possible
for
any
one
,
with
talent
inferior
to
those
of
Mr.
Locke
himself
,
to
come
up
to
the
rule
he
have
lay
down
upon
this
subject
;
and
'
tis
to
be
question
,
whether
even
he
,
with
all
that
vast
stock
of
natural
reason
and
solid
sense
,
for
which
,
as
you
tell
me
,
Sir
,
he
be
so
famous
,
have
attain
to
these
perfection
,
at
his
first
set
out
into
life
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
dear
Sir
,
you
can
not
imagine
how
these
difficulty
perplex
me
,
as
to
my
knowing
how
to
judge
which
be
good
,
a
home
or
a
school
education
.
<EOS>
for
hear
what
this
excellent
author
justly
observe
on
the
latter
,
among
other
thing
,
no
less
to
the
purpose
:
"
I
be
sure
,
he
who
be
able
to
be
at
the
charge
of
a
tutor
at
home
,
may
there
give
his
son
a
more
genteel
carriage
,
more
manly
thought
,
and
a
sense
of
what
be
worthy
and
become
,
with
a
great
proficiency
in
learning
,
into
the
bargain
,
and
ripen
him
up
sooner
into
a
man
,
than
any
school
can
do
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
blame
the
schoolmaster
in
this
,
"
say
he
,
"
or
think
it
to
be
lay
to
his
charge
.
<EOS>
the
difference
be
great
between
two
or
three
pupil
in
the
same
house
,
and
three
or
four
score
boy
lodge
up
and
down
;
for
,
let
the
master
's
industry
and
skill
be
never
so
great
<EOS>
,
it
be
impossible
he
should
have
fifty
or
an
hundred
scholar
under
his
eye
any
longer
than
they
be
in
the
school
together
.
"
<EOS>
but
then
,
Sir
,
if
there
be
such
a
difficulty
as
Mr.
Locke
say
,
to
meet
with
a
proper
tutor
for
the
home
education
,
which
he
thus
prefer
,
what
a
perplexing
thing
be
this
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
accord
to
this
gentleman
,
another
difficulty
attend
a
home
education
;
and
that
is
,
what
I
hint
at
before
,
in
my
second
article
,
the
necessity
of
keep
the
youth
out
of
the
company
of
the
mean
servant
,
who
may
set
him
bad
example
.
<EOS>
for
thus
he
say
,
"
here
be
another
great
inconvenience
,
which
child
receive
from
the
ill
example
which
they
meet
with
from
the
mean
servant
.
<EOS>
They
be
wholly
,
if
possible
,
to
be
keep
from
such
conversation
:
for
the
contagion
of
these
ill
precedent
,
both
in
civility
and
virtue
,
horribly
infect
child
,
as
often
as
they
come
within
the
reach
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
frequently
learn
from
unbred
or
debauch
servant
,
such
language
,
untowardly
trick
and
vice
,
as
otherwise
they
would
be
ignorant
of
all
their
life
.
'
<EOS>
tis
a
hard
matter
wholly
to
prevent
this
mischief
,
"
continue
he
;
"
you
will
have
very
good
luck
,
if
you
never
have
a
clownish
or
vicious
servant
,
and
if
from
them
your
child
never
get
any
infection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
,
Sir
,
my
third
point
(
which
I
mention
in
the
beginning
of
this
letter
)
make
a
still
strong
objection
,
as
it
may
happen
,
against
a
home
education
;
to
wit
,
the
example
of
the
parent
themselves
,
if
they
be
not
very
circumspect
and
discreet
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
difficulty
be
put
together
,
let
me
,
dear
Sir
,
humbly
propose
it
,
as
a
matter
for
your
consideration
and
determination
,
whether
there
be
not
a
middle
way
to
be
find
out
in
a
school
education
,
that
may
remedy
some
of
these
inconveniencie
?
<EOS>
for
suppose
you
can
not
get
a
tutor
so
qualified
as
Mr.
Locke
think
he
ought
to
be
,
for
your
Billy
as
he
grow
up
.
<EOS>
suppose
there
be
danger
from
your
mean
servant
;
or
we
his
parent
should
not
be
able
to
lay
ourselves
under
the
requisite
restraint
,
in
order
to
form
his
mind
by
our
own
example
,
which
I
hope
,
by
God
's
grace
,
however
,
will
not
be
the
case
 
<EOS>
can
not
some
master
be
find
,
who
shall
be
so
well
reward
for
his
care
of
a
few
young
gentleman
,
as
to
make
it
worth
his
while
to
be
content
with
those
few
?
 
<EOS>
suppose
from
five
to
eight
at
most
;
whose
moral
and
breeding
he
may
attend
to
,
as
well
as
to
their
learning
?
<EOS>
the
farther
this
master
live
from
the
young
gentleman
's
friend
,
the
well
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
We
will
hope
,
that
he
be
a
man
of
a
mild
disposition
,
but
strict
in
his
discipline
,
and
who
shall
make
it
a
rule
not
to
give
correction
for
small
fault
,
or
till
every
other
method
have
be
try
;
who
carry
such
a
just
dignity
in
his
manner
,
without
the
appearance
of
tyranny
,
that
his
look
may
be
of
great
force
than
the
blow
of
other
;
and
who
will
rather
endeavour
to
shame
than
terrify
,
a
youth
out
of
his
fault
.
<EOS>
then
,
suppose
this
gentleman
be
to
allot
a
particular
portion
of
time
for
the
more
learned
study
;
and
before
the
youth
be
tired
with
them
,
suppose
another
portion
be
allot
for
the
writing
and
arithmetic
;
and
then
to
relieve
his
mind
from
both
,
suppose
the
dancing
-
master
should
take
his
part
;
and
innocent
exercise
of
mere
diversion
,
to
fill
up
the
rest
,
at
his
own
choice
,
in
which
,
divert
by
such
a
rotation
of
employment
(
all
thus
render
delightful
by
their
successive
variety
)
,
he
would
hardly
wish
to
pass
much
time
.
<EOS>
for
the
dancing
of
itself
,
with
the
dancing
-
master
's
instruction
,
if
a
well
-
breed
man
,
will
answer
both
part
,
that
of
breeding
and
that
of
exercise
:
and
thus
different
study
at
once
be
master
.
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
the
emulation
which
will
be
inspire
,
where
there
be
several
young
gentleman
,
will
be
of
inconceivable
use
both
to
tutor
and
pupil
,
in
lessen
the
trouble
of
the
one
,
and
advance
the
learning
of
the
other
,
which
can
not
be
expect
where
there
be
but
a
single
youth
to
be
take
care
of
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
master
will
know
it
to
be
his
interest
,
as
well
as
duty
,
to
have
a
watchful
eye
over
the
conduct
and
behaviour
of
his
servant
.
<EOS>
His
assistant
,
in
the
different
branch
of
science
and
education
,
will
be
person
of
approve
prudence
,
for
whom
he
will
think
himself
answerable
,
since
his
own
reputation
,
as
well
as
livelihood
,
will
depend
upon
their
behaviour
.
<EOS>
the
youth
will
have
young
gentleman
for
their
companion
,
all
under
the
influence
of
the
same
precept
and
direction
;
and
if
some
choose
period
be
fix
,
as
a
reward
for
some
excellence
,
where
,
at
a
little
desk
,
raise
a
step
or
two
above
the
other
seat
,
the
excel
youth
should
be
set
to
read
,
under
the
master
's
direction
,
a
little
portion
from
the
good
translation
of
the
greek
and
roman
historian
,
and
even
from
the
good
english
author
;
this
may
,
in
a
very
engaging
manner
,
initiate
them
into
the
knowledge
of
the
history
of
past
time
,
and
of
their
own
country
,
and
give
them
a
curiosity
to
pass
some
of
their
vacant
hour
in
the
same
laudable
pursuit
:
for
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
I
must
still
insist
that
reward
,
and
innocent
gratification
,
as
also
little
honour
and
distinction
,
must
needs
be
very
attractive
to
the
mind
of
youth
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
be
not
the
pretty
ride
,
and
dairy
house
breakfasting
,
by
which
Miss
Goodwin
's
governess
distinguish
the
little
lady
who
excel
in
their
allot
task
,
a
fine
encouragement
to
their
ductile
mind
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
it
be
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
often
think
of
it
with
pleasure
,
and
partake
of
the
delight
with
which
I
have
suppose
<EOS>
their
pretty
heart
must
be
fill
with
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
and
why
may
not
such
little
triumph
be
,
in
proportion
,
as
incentive
,
to
child
,
to
make
them
try
to
master
laudable
task
;
as
the
roman
triumph
,
of
different
kind
,
and
their
mural
and
civic
crown
,
all
which
I
have
hear
you
speak
of
,
be
to
their
hero
and
warrior
of
old
?
<EOS>
for
Mr.
Dryden
<EOS>
well
observe
,
that
     
"
man
be
but
child
of
a
large
growth
;
  
<EOS>
Our
appetite
be
apt
to
change
as
theirs
,
  
and
full
as
crave
too
,
and
full
as
vain
.
"
    
<EOS>
permit
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
to
transcribe
four
or
five
line
more
,
for
the
  
beauty
of
the
thought
:
    
"
and
yet
the
soul
,
shut
up
in
her
dark
room
,
  
view
<EOS>
so
clear
abroad
,
at
home
see
nothing
:
  
<EOS>
but
like
a
mole
in
earth
,
busy
and
blind
,
  
work
all
her
folly
up
,
and
cast
it
outward
  
<EOS>
to
the
world
's
open
view
"
  
improve
the
thought
:
methinks
<EOS>
I
can
see
the
dear
little
Miss
,
who
have
,
in
some
eminent
task
,
borne
away
the
palm
,
make
her
public
entry
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
after
her
dairy
breakfast
and
pretty
airing
,
into
the
governess
's
court
-
yard
,
through
a
row
of
her
school
-
fellow
,
draw
out
on
each
side
to
admire
her
;
her
governess
and
assistant
receive
her
at
the
porch
,
their
little
capitol
,
and
lift
her
out
with
applause
and
encomium
,
with
a
thus
shall
it
be
do
to
the
Miss
,
whom
her
governess
delighteth
to
honour
!
<EOS>
I
see
not
why
the
dear
Miss
in
this
case
,
as
she
move
through
her
admire
school
-
fellow
,
may
not
have
her
little
heart
beat
with
as
much
delight
,
be
as
gloriously
elated
,
proportionably
,
as
that
of
the
great
hero
in
his
triumphal
car
,
who
have
return
from
exploit
,
perhaps
,
much
less
laudable
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
I
ramble
!
 
<EOS>
yet
surely
,
Sir
,
you
do
not
expect
method
or
connection
from
your
girl
.
<EOS>
the
education
of
our
sex
will
not
permit
that
,
where
it
be
good
.
<EOS>
We
be
force
to
struggle
for
knowledge
,
like
the
poor
feeble
infant
in
the
month
,
who
be
pin
and
fetter
down
upon
the
nurse
's
lap
;
and
who
,
if
its
little
arm
happen
,
by
chance
,
to
escape
its
nurse
's
observation
,
and
offer
but
to
expand
themselves
,
be
immediately
take
into
custody
,
and
pinion
down
to
their
passive
behaviour
.
<EOS>
so
,
when
a
poor
girl
,
in
spite
of
her
narrow
education
,
break
out
into
notice
,
her
genius
be
immediately
tame
by
trifle
employment
,
l
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
she
should
become
the
envy
of
one
sex
,
and
the
equal
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
act
more
nobly
with
your
Pamela
;
for
you
throw
in
her
way
all
opportunity
of
improvement
;
and
she
have
only
to
regret
,
that
she
can
not
make
a
well
use
of
them
,
and
,
of
consequence
,
render
herself
more
worthy
of
your
generous
indulgence
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
,
Sir
,
to
recover
my
thread
;
and
so
must
break
off
with
that
delight
which
I
always
take
when
I
come
near
the
bottom
of
my
letter
to
your
dear
self
;
because
then
I
can
boast
of
the
honour
which
I
have
in
be
your
ever
dutiful
,
  
<EOS>
P.B.
    
well
,
but
<EOS>
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
you
will
perhaps
think
,
from
my
last
rambling
letter
,
that
I
be
most
inclined
to
a
school
education
for
your
Billy
,
and
some
year
hence
,
if
it
should
please
God
to
spare
him
to
us
.
<EOS>
yet
I
can
not
say
that
I
be
;
I
only
lie
several
thing
together
in
my
usual
indigested
way
,
to
take
your
opinion
upon
,
which
,
as
it
ought
,
will
be
always
decisive
with
me
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
be
so
thoroughly
convince
by
Mr.
Locke
's
reason
,
where
the
behaviour
of
servant
can
be
so
well
answer
for
,
as
that
of
yours
can
be
,
and
where
the
example
of
the
parent
will
be
,
as
I
hope
,
rather
edify
than
otherwise
,
that
without
be
sway
,
as
I
think
,
by
maternal
fondness
,
in
this
case
,
I
must
needs
give
a
preference
to
the
home
education
;
and
the
little
scheme
I
presume
to
form
in
my
last
,
be
only
on
a
supposition
,
that
those
necessary
point
could
not
be
so
well
secure
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
observation
on
this
head
,
I
shall
take
the
liberty
,
in
one
or
two
particular
,
a
little
to
differ
from
an
author
,
that
I
admire
exceedingly
;
and
that
be
the
present
design
of
my
write
these
letter
;
for
I
shall
hereafter
<EOS>
,
if
God
spare
my
life
,
in
my
little
book
(
when
you
have
kindly
decide
upon
the
point
in
which
I
presume
to
differ
)
shew
you
,
Sir
,
my
great
reverence
and
esteem
for
him
;
and
can
then
let
you
know
all
my
sentiment
on
this
important
subject
,
and
that
more
undoubtedly
,
as
I
shall
be
more
improve
by
year
and
your
conversation
;
especially
,
Sir
,
if
I
have
the
honour
and
happiness
of
a
foreign
tour
with
you
,
of
which
you
give
me
hope
;
so
much
be
you
pleased
with
the
delight
I
take
in
these
improve
excursion
,
which
you
have
now
favour
me
with
,
at
different
time
,
through
more
than
half
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
well
then
,
Sir
,
I
will
proceed
to
consider
a
little
more
particularly
the
subject
of
a
home
education
,
with
an
eye
to
those
difficulty
,
of
which
Mr.
Locke
take
notice
,
as
I
mention
in
my
last
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
first
,
that
of
find
a
qualified
tutor
;
we
must
not
expect
so
much
perfection
,
I
doubt
,
as
he
lay
down
as
necessary
.
<EOS>
what
,
therefore
,
I
humbly
conceive
be
good
to
be
do
,
will
be
to
avoid
choose
a
man
of
bigoted
and
narrow
principle
;
who
yet
shall
not
be
taint
with
sceptical
or
heterodox
notion
,
nor
a
mere
scholar
or
pedant
;
who
have
travel
,
and
yet
preserve
his
moral
character
untainted
;
and
whose
behaviour
and
carriage
be
easy
,
unaffected
,
unformal
,
and
genteel
,
as
well
acquiredly
as
naturally
so
,
if
possible
;
who
shall
not
be
dogmatical
,
positive
,
overbearing
,
on
one
hand
;
nor
too
yielding
,
suppliant
,
fawning
,
on
the
other
;
who
shall
study
the
child
's
natural
bent
,
in
order
to
direct
his
study
to
the
point
he
be
most
likely
to
excel
in
;
and
to
preserve
the
respect
due
to
his
own
character
from
every
one
,
he
must
not
be
a
busy
body
in
the
family
,
a
whisperer
,
a
tale
-
bearer
,
but
of
a
benevolent
turn
of
mind
,
ready
to
compose
difference
;
who
shall
avoid
,
of
all
thing
,
that
foppishness
of
dress
and
appearance
,
which
distinguish
the
petit
-
maitre
,
and
french
usher
(
that
I
have
see
at
some
boarding
school
)
,
for
coxcomb
rather
than
guide
of
education
:
for
,
as
I
have
hear
you
,
my
good
tutor
,
often
observe
,
the
peculiarity
of
habit
,
where
a
person
aim
at
something
fantastic
,
or
out
of
character
,
be
an
undoubted
sign
of
a
wrong
head
;
for
such
a
one
be
so
kind
as
always
to
hang
out
on
his
sign
<EOS>
what
sort
of
furniture
he
have
in
his
shop
,
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
ask
question
about
him
;
so
that
one
may
as
easily
know
by
his
outward
appearance
what
he
be
,
as
one
can
know
a
widow
by
her
weed
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
person
as
I
have
thus
negatively
describe
,
may
be
find
without
very
much
difficulty
,
perhaps
,
because
some
of
these
requisite
be
personal
,
and
other
be
such
as
be
obvious
at
first
sight
,
to
a
common
penetration
;
or
,
where
not
so
,
may
be
find
out
,
by
inquiry
into
his
general
character
and
behaviour
:
<EOS>
and
to
the
care
of
such
a
one
,
dear
Sir
,
let
me
suppose
your
Billy
be
commit
:
<EOS>
and
so
we
acquit
ourselves
of
the
first
difficulty
,
as
well
as
we
can
,
that
of
the
tutor
;
who
,
to
become
more
perfect
,
may
form
himself
,
as
to
what
he
want
,
by
Mr.
Locke
's
excellent
rule
on
that
head
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
I
quit
this
subject
,
I
beg
to
remind
you
of
your
opinion
upon
it
,
in
a
conversation
with
Sir
George
Stuart
,
and
his
nephew
,
in
London
;
in
which
you
seem
to
prefer
a
scottish
gentleman
for
a
tutor
,
to
those
of
your
own
nation
,
and
still
more
than
to
those
of
France
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
it
,
dear
Sir
?
<EOS>
and
how
much
those
gentleman
be
pleased
with
your
facetious
freedom
with
their
country
,
and
say
,
you
make
them
amend
for
that
,
in
your
preference
to
their
learn
and
travel
youth
?
<EOS>
if
you
have
forget
it
,
I
will
here
transcribe
it
from
my
record
,
as
I
call
my
book
of
memorandum
;
for
every
time
I
be
pleased
with
a
conversation
,
and
have
leisure
,
before
it
quit
my
memory
,
I
enter
it
down
in
as
near
the
very
word
as
I
can
;
and
now
you
have
make
me
your
correspondent
<EOS>
,
I
shall
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
give
you
back
some
valuable
from
your
own
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Darnford
,
and
Mr.
Turner
,
and
Mr.
Fanshaw
,
be
present
,
I
well
remember
.
<EOS>
these
be
your
word
:
  
"
since
the
union
of
the
two
kingdom
,
we
have
many
person
of
condition
,
who
have
take
their
tutor
for
their
son
from
Scotland
;
which
practice
,
to
speak
impartially
,
have
be
attend
with
some
advantageous
circumstance
,
that
should
not
be
overlook
.
<EOS>
for
,
Sir
George
,
it
must
be
confess
that
,
notwithstanding
your
narrow
and
stiff
manner
of
education
in
Scotland
,
a
spirit
of
manly
learning
,
a
kind
of
poetic
liberty
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
have
begin
to
exert
itself
in
that
part
of
the
island
.
<EOS>
the
blustering
north
 
forgive
me
,
gentleman
 
seem
to
have
harden
the
forehead
of
her
hungry
son
;
and
the
keenness
with
which
they
set
out
for
preferment
in
the
kindly
south
,
have
teach
them
to
know
a
good
deal
of
the
world
betime
.
<EOS>
through
the
easy
term
on
which
learn
be
generally
attain
there
,
as
it
be
earlier
inculcate
,
so
it
may
,
probably
,
take
deep
root
:
and
since
'
tis
hardly
possible
 
forgive
me
,
dear
sir
 
they
can
go
to
a
bad
country
on
this
side
Greenland
,
than
some
of
the
northern
part
of
Scotland
;
so
their
education
,
with
a
view
to
travel
,
and
to
better
themselves
by
settlement
in
other
country
,
may
,
perhaps
,
be
so
many
reason
to
take
great
pain
to
qualify
themselves
for
this
employment
,
and
may
make
them
succeed
better
in
it
;
especially
when
they
have
be
able
to
shake
off
the
fetter
which
be
rivette
upon
them
under
the
narrow
influence
of
a
too
tyrannical
kirk
discipline
,
which
you
,
Sir
George
,
have
just
now
so
freely
censure
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
these
consideration
,
when
we
add
the
necessity
,
which
these
remote
tutor
lie
under
,
of
behave
well
;
first
,
because
they
seldom
wish
to
return
to
their
own
country
;
and
next
,
because
that
can
not
prefer
them
,
if
it
would
;
and
thirdly
,
because
it
would
not
,
if
it
could
,
if
the
gentleman
be
of
an
enlarge
genius
,
and
generous
way
of
thinking
;
I
say
,
when
we
add
to
the
premise
these
consideration
,
they
all
make
a
kind
of
security
for
their
good
behaviour
:
while
those
of
our
own
country
have
often
friend
or
acquaintance
on
whose
favour
they
be
apt
to
depend
,
and
for
that
reason
give
less
attention
to
the
duty
requisite
for
this
important
office
.
  
<EOS>
"
besides
,
as
their
kind
friend
AEolus
,
who
be
accustomed
to
spread
and
strengthen
the
bold
muscle
of
the
strong
-
feature
Scot
,
have
generally
blow
away
that
inauspicious
bashfulness
,
which
hang
a
much
long
time
,
commonly
,
on
the
face
of
the
southern
student
;
such
a
one
(
if
he
fall
not
too
egregiously
into
the
contrary
extreme
,
so
as
to
become
insufferable
)
may
still
be
the
more
eligible
person
for
a
tutor
,
as
he
may
teach
a
young
gentleman
,
betime
,
that
necessary
presence
of
mind
,
which
those
who
be
confine
to
a
private
education
sometimes
want
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
after
all
,
if
a
gentleman
of
this
nation
be
choose
for
this
employment
,
it
may
be
necessary
that
he
should
be
one
who
have
have
as
genteel
and
free
an
education
himself
,
as
his
country
will
afford
;
and
the
native
roughness
of
his
climate
file
off
by
travel
and
conversation
;
who
have
make
,
at
least
,
the
tour
of
France
and
Italy
,
and
have
a
taste
for
the
politeness
of
the
former
nation
:
but
from
the
boisterousness
of
a
North
Britain
,
and
the
fantastic
politeness
of
a
Frenchman
,
if
happily
blend
,
such
a
mixture
may
result
,
as
will
furnish
out
a
more
complete
tutor
,
than
either
of
the
two
nation
,
singly
,
may
be
able
to
produce
.
<EOS>
but
it
ought
to
be
remember
that
this
person
must
have
conquer
his
native
brogue
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
and
be
a
master
of
the
english
pronunciation
;
otherwise
his
conversation
will
be
disagreeable
to
an
english
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
permit
me
to
add
,
that
,
as
an
acquaintance
with
the
Muses
contribute
not
a
little
to
soften
the
manner
,
and
give
a
graceful
and
delicate
turn
to
the
imagination
,
and
a
kind
of
polish
to
severer
study
,
it
would
not
be
amiss
that
he
should
have
a
taste
of
poetry
,
although
perhaps
it
be
not
to
be
wish
he
have
such
strong
inclination
that
way
,
as
to
make
that
lively
and
delectable
amusement
his
predominant
passion
:
for
we
see
very
few
poet
,
whose
warm
imagination
do
not
run
away
with
their
judgment
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
in
order
to
learn
the
dead
language
in
their
purity
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
inculcate
both
the
love
and
the
study
of
the
ancient
poet
,
which
can
not
fail
of
give
the
youth
a
taste
for
poetry
,
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
permit
me
,
dear
Sir
,
to
ask
you
,
whether
you
advance
this
for
argument
sake
,
as
sometimes
you
love
to
amuse
and
entertain
your
friend
in
an
uncommon
way
?
<EOS>
for
I
should
imagine
,
that
our
two
university
,
which
you
have
shew
me
,
and
for
which
I
have
ever
since
have
a
great
reverence
than
I
have
before
,
be
capable
of
furnish
as
good
tutor
as
any
nation
in
the
world
:
for
here
the
young
gentleman
seem
to
me
to
live
both
in
the
world
and
in
the
university
;
and
we
see
several
gentleman
who
have
not
only
fine
part
,
but
polite
behaviour
,
and
deep
learning
,
as
you
assure
me
;
some
of
whom
you
entertain
,
and
be
entertain
by
,
in
so
elegant
a
manner
,
that
no
travel
gentleman
,
if
I
may
be
allow
to
judge
,
could
excel
them
!
<EOS>
and
besides
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
I
know
who
be
reckon
one
of
the
polite
and
best
-
breed
gentleman
in
England
by
every
body
,
and
learn
as
well
as
polite
,
and
yet
have
his
education
in
one
of
those
celebrate
seat
of
learning
.
<EOS>
I
wish
your
Billy
may
never
fall
short
of
the
gentleman
I
mean
,
in
all
these
acquirement
;
and
he
will
be
a
very
happy
creature
,
I
be
sure
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
I
wander
again
from
my
subject
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
way
to
recover
myself
,
when
I
thus
ramble
,
but
by
return
to
that
one
delightful
point
of
reflection
,
that
I
have
the
honour
to
be
,
dear
Sir

<EOS>
your
ever
dutiful
and
oblige

<EOS>
P.B.
    
DEAREST
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
I
now
resume
my
subject
.
<EOS>
I
have
go
through
the
article
of
the
tutor
,
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
will
now
observe
upon
what
Mr.
Locke
say
,
that
child
be
wholly
,
if
possible
,
to
be
keep
from
the
conversation
of
the
mean
servant
;
whom
he
suppose
to
be
,
as
too
frequently
they
be
,
unbred
and
debauch
,
to
use
his
own
word
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
,
I
think
it
be
very
difficult
to
keep
child
from
the
conversation
of
servant
at
all
time
.
<EOS>
the
care
of
personal
attendance
,
especially
in
the
child
's
early
age
,
must
fall
upon
servant
of
one
denomination
or
other
,
who
,
little
or
much
,
must
be
conversant
with
the
inferior
servant
,
and
so
be
liable
to
be
taint
by
their
conversation
;
and
it
will
be
difficult
in
this
case
to
prevent
the
taint
be
communicate
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
wherefore
it
will
be
a
surer
,
as
well
as
a
more
laudable
method
,
to
insist
upon
the
regular
behaviour
of
the
whole
family
,
than
to
expect
the
child
,
and
its
immediate
attendant
or
tutor
,
should
be
the
only
good
one
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
this
so
difficult
to
effect
,
as
may
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
Your
family
afford
an
eminent
instance
of
it
:
the
good
have
be
confirm
,
the
remiss
have
be
reform
,
the
passionate
have
be
tame
;
and
there
be
not
a
family
in
the
kingdom
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
to
the
honour
of
every
individual
in
it
,
more
uniform
,
more
regular
,
and
free
from
evil
,
and
more
regardful
of
what
they
say
and
do
,
than
yours
.
<EOS>
and
you
will
allow
,
that
though
always
honest
,
yet
they
be
not
always
so
laudable
,
so
exemplarily
virtuous
,
as
of
late
:
which
I
mention
only
to
shew
the
practicableness
of
a
reformation
,
even
where
bad
habit
have
take
place
 
for
your
Pamela
,
Sir
,
arrogate
not
to
herself
the
honour
of
this
change
:
'
tis
owe
to
the
Divine
grace
shine
upon
heart
naturally
good
;
for
else
an
example
so
easy
,
so
plain
,
so
simple
,
from
so
young
a
mistress
,
who
moreover
have
be
exalt
from
their
own
station
,
could
not
have
be
attend
with
such
happy
effect
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
dear
Sir
,
what
a
master
and
mistress
's
example
could
do
,
with
a
poor
soul
so
far
go
as
Mrs.
Jewkes
.
<EOS>
and
I
dare
be
confident
,
that
if
,
on
the
hiring
of
a
new
servant
,
sobriety
of
manner
and
a
virtuous
conversation
be
insist
upon
,
and
a
general
inoffensiveness
in
word
as
well
as
action
be
require
from
them
,
as
indispensable
condition
of
their
service
:
and
that
a
breach
of
that
kind
would
be
no
more
pass
over
,
than
a
wilful
fraud
,
or
an
act
of
dishonesty
;
and
if
,
add
to
these
requisite
,
their
principal
take
care
to
support
these
injunction
by
their
own
example
;
I
say
,
then
,
I
dare
be
confident
,
that
if
such
a
service
do
not
find
them
good
,
it
would
make
them
so
.
  
<EOS>
and
why
should
we
not
think
this
a
very
practicable
scheme
,
consider
the
servant
we
take
be
at
year
of
discretion
,
and
have
the
strong
tie
of
interest
superadde
to
the
obligation
we
require
of
them
?
<EOS>
and
which
,
they
must
needs
know
<EOS>
(
let
'em
have
what
bad
habit
they
will
)
be
right
for
themselves
to
discharge
,
as
well
as
for
us
to
exact
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
know
of
how
much
force
the
example
of
superior
be
to
inferior
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
justly
say
,
that
the
court
of
prince
abound
with
the
most
profligate
of
man
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
a
man
can
not
well
have
a
more
significantly
bad
title
,
than
that
of
COURTIER
:
yet
even
among
these
<EOS>
,
one
shall
see
the
force
of
example
,
as
I
have
hear
you
,
Sir
,
frequently
observe
:
for
,
let
but
<EOS>
the
land
be
bless
with
a
pious
and
religious
prince
,
who
make
it
a
rule
with
him
to
countenance
and
promote
man
of
virtue
and
probity
;
and
to
put
the
case
still
strong
,
let
such
a
one
even
succeed
to
the
most
libertine
reign
,
wherein
the
manner
of
the
people
be
wholly
deprave
:
yet
a
wonderful
change
will
be
immediately
effect
.
<EOS>
the
flagitious
liver
will
be
chase
away
,
or
reform
;
or
at
least
will
think
it
their
duty
,
or
their
interest
,
which
be
a
strong
tie
with
such
,
to
appear
reform
;
and
not
a
man
will
seek
for
the
favour
or
countenance
of
his
prince
,
but
by
laudable
pretence
,
or
by
worthy
action
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
reign
of
King
Richard
III
,
as
I
have
read
,
deformity
of
body
be
the
fashion
,
and
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
court
think
it
an
indispensable
requisite
of
a
graceful
form
to
pad
for
themselves
a
round
shoulder
,
because
the
king
be
crooked
.
<EOS>
and
can
we
think
human
nature
so
absurdly
wicked
,
that
it
would
not
much
rather
have
try
to
imitate
a
personal
perfection
,
than
a
deformity
so
shocking
in
its
appearance
,
in
people
who
be
naturally
straight
?
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
melancholy
to
reflect
,
that
of
all
profession
of
man
,
the
mariner
,
who
most
behold
the
wonder
of
Almighty
power
display
in
the
great
deep
(
a
sight
that
have
strike
me
with
awe
and
reverence
only
from
a
coast
prospect
)
,
and
<EOS>
who
every
moment
,
while
at
sea
,
have
but
one
frail
plank
betwixt
themselves
and
inevitable
destruction
,
be
yet
,
generally
speak
,
say
to
be
the
most
abandon
invoker
and
blasphemer
of
the
name
of
that
God
,
whose
mercy
they
every
moment
unthankfully
,
although
so
visibly
,
experience
.
<EOS>
yet
,
as
I
once
hear
at
your
table
,
Sir
,
on
a
particular
occasion
,
we
have
now
a
commander
in
the
british
navy
,
who
,
to
his
honour
,
have
shew
the
force
of
an
excellent
example
support
the
good
precept
:
<EOS>
for
,
on
board
of
his
ship
,
not
an
oath
or
curse
be
to
be
hear
;
while
volley
of
both
(
issue
from
impious
mouth
in
the
same
squadron
,
out
of
his
knowledge
)
seem
to
fill
the
sail
of
other
ship
with
guilty
breath
,
call
aloud
for
that
perdition
to
overtake
them
,
which
perhaps
his
worthy
injunction
and
example
,
in
his
own
,
may
be
of
weight
to
suspend
.
  
<EOS>
if
such
then
,
dear
Sir
,
be
the
force
of
a
good
example
,
what
have
parent
to
do
,
who
would
bring
up
a
child
at
home
under
their
own
eye
,
accord
to
Mr.
Locke
's
advice
,
but
,
first
,
to
have
a
strict
regard
to
their
conduct
!
<EOS>
this
will
not
want
its
due
influence
on
the
servant
;
especially
if
a
proper
enquiry
be
first
make
into
their
character
,
and
a
watchful
eye
have
over
them
,
to
keep
them
up
to
those
character
afterwards
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
know
they
must
forfeit
the
favour
of
a
worthy
master
,
and
their
place
too
(
which
may
be
think
to
be
the
good
of
place
,
because
an
uniform
character
must
make
all
around
it
easy
and
happy
)
,
they
will
readily
observe
such
rule
and
direction
,
as
shall
be
prescribe
to
them
 
rule
and
direction
,
which
their
own
conscience
will
tell
them
be
right
to
be
prescribe
;
and
even
right
for
them
to
follow
,
be
they
not
insist
upon
by
their
superior
:
and
this
conviction
must
go
a
great
way
towards
their
thorough
reformation
:
for
a
person
wholly
convinced
be
half
reform
.
<EOS>
and
thus
the
hazard
a
child
will
run
of
be
corrupt
by
converse
with
the
servant
,
will
be
remove
,
and
all
Mr.
Locke
's
other
rule
be
better
enforce
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
boldness
,
Sir
,
to
make
another
objection
;
and
that
be
,
to
the
distance
which
Mr.
Locke
prescribe
to
be
keep
between
child
and
servant
:
for
may
not
this
be
a
means
to
fill
the
mind
of
the
former
with
a
contempt
of
those
below
them
,
and
an
arrogance
that
be
not
warrant
by
any
rank
or
condition
,
to
their
inferior
of
the
same
specie
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
before
transcribe
what
Mr.
Locke
have
enjoin
in
relation
to
this
distance
,
where
he
say
,
that
the
child
be
by
all
mean
to
be
keep
wholly
from
the
conversation
of
the
mean
servant
.
<EOS>
but
how
much
well
advice
do
the
same
author
give
for
the
behaviour
of
child
to
servant
in
the
follow
word
which
,
I
humbly
think
,
be
not
so
entirely
consistent
with
the
former
,
as
may
be
expect
from
so
admirable
an
author
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
another
way
,
"
say
he
(
section
111
)
,
"
to
instil
sentiment
of
humanity
,
and
to
keep
them
lively
in
young
folk
,
will
be
,
to
accustom
them
to
civility
in
their
language
and
deportment
towards
their
inferior
,
and
mean
sort
of
people
,
particularly
servant
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
unusual
to
observe
the
child
in
gentleman
's
family
treat
the
servant
of
the
house
with
domineering
word
,
name
of
contempt
,
and
an
imperious
carriage
,
as
if
they
be
of
another
race
,
or
specie
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
whether
ill
example
,
the
advantage
of
fortune
or
their
natural
vanity
,
inspire
this
haughtiness
,
it
should
be
prevent
or
weed
out
;
and
a
gentle
,
courteous
,
affable
carriage
towards
the
low
rank
of
man
place
in
the
room
of
it
.
<EOS>
no
part
of
their
superiority
will
be
hereby
lose
,
but
the
distinction
increase
,
and
their
authority
strengthen
,
when
love
in
inferior
be
join
to
outward
respect
,
and
the
esteem
of
the
person
have
a
share
in
their
submission
:
and
domestic
will
pay
a
more
ready
and
cheerful
service
,
when
they
find
themselves
not
spurn
,
because
fortune
have
lay
them
below
the
level
of
other
at
their
master
's
foot
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
,
dear
Sir
,
be
certainly
the
sentiment
of
a
generous
and
enlarged
spirit
:
but
I
hope
,
I
may
observe
,
that
the
great
distance
Mr.
Locke
before
enjoin
to
be
keep
between
child
and
servant
,
be
not
very
consistent
with
the
above
-
cite
paragraph
:
for
if
we
would
prevent
this
undue
contempt
of
inferior
in
the
temper
of
child
,
the
good
way
,
as
I
humbly
presume
to
think
,
be
not
to
make
it
so
unpardonable
a
fault
for
them
,
especially
in
their
early
year
,
to
be
in
their
company
.
<EOS>
for
can
one
make
the
child
shun
the
servant
without
render
them
odious
or
contemptible
to
them
,
and
represent
them
to
the
child
in
such
disadvantageous
light
,
as
must
need
make
the
servant
vile
in
their
eye
,
and
themselves
lofty
and
exalt
in
their
own
?
<EOS>
and
thereby
cause
them
to
treat
them
with
"
domineering
word
,
and
an
imperious
carriage
,
as
if
they
be
of
another
race
or
specie
beneath
them
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
"
as
Mr.
Locke
say
,
"
nurse
up
their
natural
pride
into
an
habitual
contempt
of
those
beneath
them
;
and
then
,
"
as
he
add
,
"
where
will
that
probably
end
,
but
in
oppression
and
cruelty
?
"
<EOS>
but
this
matter
,
dear
Sir
,
I
presume
to
think
,
will
all
be
happily
accommodate
and
reconcile
,
when
the
servant
'
good
behaviour
be
secure
by
the
example
and
injunction
of
the
principal
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
then
,
of
what
Mr.
Locke
have
enjoin
,
and
what
I
have
take
the
liberty
to
suggest
on
this
head
,
it
shall
be
my
endeavour
,
in
that
early
part
of
your
dear
Billy
's
education
,
which
you
will
intrust
to
me
,
to
inculcate
betime
in
his
mind
the
principle
of
universal
benevolence
and
kindness
to
other
,
especially
to
inferior
.
  
<EOS>
nor
shall
I
fear
,
that
the
little
dear
will
be
want
to
himself
in
assume
,
as
he
grow
up
,
an
air
of
superiority
and
distance
of
behaviour
equal
to
his
condition
,
or
that
he
will
descend
too
low
for
his
station
.
<EOS>
for
,
Sir
,
there
be
a
pride
and
self
-
love
natural
to
human
mind
,
that
will
seldom
be
keep
so
low
,
as
to
make
them
humble
than
they
ought
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
observe
,
before
now
,
instance
of
this
,
in
some
of
the
family
we
visit
,
between
the
young
Masters
or
Misses
,
and
those
child
of
low
degree
,
who
have
be
bring
to
play
with
them
,
or
divert
them
.
<EOS>
on
the
Masters
'
and
Misses
'
side
<EOS>
I
have
always
see
,
they
lead
the
play
and
prescribe
the
law
of
it
,
be
the
diversion
what
it
will
;
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
their
low
-
rank
play
-
fellow
have
generally
give
into
their
little
humour
,
though
ever
so
contrary
to
their
own
;
and
the
difference
of
dress
and
appearance
,
and
the
notion
they
have
of
the
more
eminent
condition
of
their
play
-
fellow
'
parent
,
have
beget
in
them
a
kind
of
awe
and
respect
,
that
perhaps
more
than
sufficiently
secure
the
superiority
of
the
one
,
and
the
subordination
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
advantage
of
this
universal
benevolence
to
a
young
gentleman
,
as
he
grow
up
,
will
be
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
,
so
to
diffuse
itself
over
his
mind
,
as
to
influence
all
his
action
,
and
give
a
grace
to
every
thing
he
do
or
say
,
and
make
him
admire
and
respect
from
the
good
and
most
durable
motive
;
and
will
be
of
great
advantage
to
him
for
his
attain
a
handsome
address
and
behaviour
(
for
it
will
make
him
conscious
that
he
merit
the
distinction
he
will
meet
with
,
and
encourage
him
still
more
to
merit
it
)
,
than
the
good
rule
that
can
be
give
him
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
teach
the
little
dear
courteousness
and
affability
,
from
the
proper
motive
I
be
able
to
think
of
;
and
will
instruct
him
in
only
one
piece
of
pride
,
that
of
be
above
do
a
mean
or
low
action
.
<EOS>
I
will
caution
him
not
to
behave
in
a
lordly
or
insolent
manner
,
even
to
the
low
servant
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
him
that
that
superiority
be
the
most
commendable
,
and
will
be
the
best
maintain
,
which
be
owe
to
humanity
and
kindness
,
and
ground
on
the
perfection
of
the
mind
,
rather
than
on
the
accidental
advantage
of
fortune
and
condition
:
that
if
his
conduct
be
such
as
it
ought
to
be
,
there
will
be
no
occasion
to
tell
a
servant
,
that
he
will
be
observe
and
respect
:
that
humility
,
as
I
once
tell
my
Miss
Goodwin
,
be
a
charming
grace
,
and
most
conspicuously
charming
in
person
of
distinction
;
for
that
the
poor
,
who
be
humble
by
their
condition
,
can
not
glory
in
it
,
as
the
rich
may
;
and
that
it
make
the
low
rank
of
people
love
and
admire
the
high
-
bear
,
who
can
so
condescend
:
whereas
pride
,
in
such
,
be
meanness
and
insult
,
as
it
owe
its
boast
and
its
being
to
accidental
advantage
;
which
,
at
the
same
time
,
be
seldom
of
his
procuring
,
who
can
be
so
mean
as
to
be
proud
:
that
even
I
would
sooner
forget
pride
in
a
low
degree
than
in
a
high
;
for
it
may
be
a
security
in
the
first
against
do
a
base
thing
:
<EOS>
but
in
the
rich
,
it
be
a
base
thing
itself
,
and
an
impolitic
one
too
;
for
the
more
distinction
a
proud
mind
grasp
at
,
the
less
it
will
have
;
and
every
poor
despised
person
can
whisper
such
a
one
in
the
ear
,
when
surround
with
,
and
adorn
by
,
all
his
glitter
splendour
,
that
he
be
bear
,
and
must
die
,
in
the
same
manner
with
those
whom
he
despise
.
  
<EOS>
thus
will
the
doctrine
of
benevolence
and
affability
,
implant
early
in
the
mind
of
a
young
gentleman
,
and
duly
cultivate
as
he
grow
up
,
inspire
him
with
the
requisite
conduct
to
command
respect
from
proper
motive
;
and
while
it
will
make
the
servant
observe
a
decorum
towards
him
,
it
will
oblige
them
to
have
a
guard
upon
their
word
and
action
in
presence
of
one
,
whose
manner
of
education
and
training
-
up
would
be
so
great
a
reproach
to
them
,
if
they
be
grossly
faulty
:
so
thus
,
I
conceive
,
<EOS>
a
mutual
benefit
will
flow
to
the
manner
of
each
;
and
his
good
behaviour
will
render
him
,
in
some
measure
,
an
instructive
monitor
to
the
whole
family
.
  
<EOS>
but
permit
me
,
Sir
,
to
enlarge
on
the
hint
I
have
already
give
,
in
relation
to
the
example
of
parent
,
in
case
a
preference
be
give
to
the
home
education
.
<EOS>
for
if
this
point
can
not
be
secure
,
I
should
always
imagine
it
be
good
to
put
the
child
to
such
a
school
,
as
I
formerly
mention
.
<EOS>
but
yet
the
subject
may
be
spare
by
me
in
this
case
,
as
I
write
with
a
view
only
to
your
family
;
though
you
will
remember
,
that
while
I
follow
Mr.
Locke
,
whose
work
be
public
,
I
must
be
consider
as
direct
myself
to
the
generality
of
the
world
:
for
,
Sir
,
I
have
the
pleasure
to
say
,
that
your
conduct
in
your
family
be
unexceptionable
;
and
the
pride
to
think
that
mine
be
no
disgrace
to
it
.
<EOS>
no
one
hear
a
word
from
your
mouth
unbecome
the
character
of
a
polite
gentleman
;
and
I
shall
always
be
very
regardful
of
what
fall
from
mine
.
<EOS>
Your
temper
,
Sir
,
be
equal
and
kind
to
all
your
servant
,
and
they
love
you
,
as
well
as
awfully
respect
you
:
and
well
do
your
beautiful
and
considerate
mind
,
deserve
it
of
them
all
:
and
<EOS>
they
,
see
I
be
watchful
over
my
own
conduct
,
so
as
not
to
behave
unworthy
of
your
kind
example
,
regard
me
as
much
as
I
could
wish
they
should
;
for
well
do
they
know
,
that
their
beloved
master
will
have
it
so
,
and
greatly
honour
and
esteem
me
himself
.
<EOS>
Your
table
-
talk
be
such
as
person
of
the
strict
principle
may
hear
,
and
join
in
:
your
guest
,
and
your
friend
be
,
generally
speak
,
person
of
the
genteel
life
,
and
of
the
good
manner
.
<EOS>
so
that
Mr.
Locke
would
have
advise
you
,
of
all
gentleman
,
have
he
be
live
,
and
know
you
,
to
give
your
child
a
home
education
,
and
assign
these
,
and
still
strong
reason
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
we
to
speak
to
the
generality
of
parent
<EOS>
,
I
fear
this
would
be
an
almost
insuperable
objection
to
a
home
education
.
<EOS>
for
(
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
)
<EOS>
when
one
turn
one
's
eye
to
the
bad
precedent
give
by
the
head
of
some
family
,
it
be
hardly
to
be
wonder
at
,
that
there
be
so
little
virtue
and
religion
among
man
.
<EOS>
for
can
those
parent
be
surprised
at
the
ungraciousness
of
their
child
,
who
hardly
ever
shew
them
,
that
their
own
action
be
govern
by
reasonable
or
moral
motive
?
<EOS>
Can
the
gluttonous
father
expect
a
self
-
deny
son
?
<EOS>
with
how
ill
a
grace
must
a
man
who
will
often
be
disguise
in
liquor
,
preach
sobriety
?
<EOS>
a
passionate
man
,
patience
?
<EOS>
an
irreligious
man
,
piety
?
<EOS>
how
will
a
parent
,
whose
hand
be
seldom
without
card
,
or
dice
in
them
,
be
observe
in
lesson
against
the
pernicious
vice
of
gaming
?
<EOS>
Can
the
profuse
father
,
who
be
squander
away
the
fortune
of
his
child
,
expect
to
be
regard
in
a
lesson
of
frugality
?
'
<EOS>
tis
impossible
he
should
,
except
it
be
that
the
youth
,
see
how
pernicious
his
father
's
example
be
,
should
have
the
grace
to
make
a
proper
use
of
it
,
and
look
upon
it
as
a
sea
-
mark
,
as
it
be
,
to
enable
him
to
shun
the
dangerous
rock
,
on
which
he
see
his
father
splitting
.
<EOS>
and
even
in
this
good
case
,
let
it
be
consider
,
how
much
shame
and
disgrace
his
thoughtless
parent
ought
to
take
to
himself
,
who
can
admonish
his
child
by
nothing
but
the
odiousness
of
his
own
vice
;
and
how
little
it
be
owe
to
him
,
that
his
guilt
be
not
double
,
by
his
son
's
treading
in
his
step
!
<EOS>
let
such
an
unhappy
parent
duly
weigh
this
,
and
think
how
likely
he
be
to
be
,
by
his
bad
example
,
the
cause
of
his
child
's
perdition
,
as
well
as
his
own
,
and
stand
unshocked
and
unamended
,
if
he
can
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
of
no
avail
to
wish
for
discreet
servant
,
if
the
conduct
of
the
parent
be
faulty
.
<EOS>
if
the
fountain
-
head
be
pollute
,
how
shall
the
under
-
current
run
clear
?
<EOS>
that
master
and
mistress
,
who
would
exact
from
their
servant
a
behaviour
which
they
themselves
do
not
practice
,
will
be
but
ill
observed
.
<EOS>
and
that
child
,
who
discover
excess
and
error
in
his
parent
,
will
be
find
to
be
less
profit
by
their
good
precept
,
than
prejudice
by
bad
example
.
<EOS>
excessive
fondness
this
hour
;
violent
passion
and
perhaps
execration
,
the
next
;
unguarded
jest
,
and
admiration
of
fashionable
vanity
,
rash
censure
,
be
perhaps
the
good
,
that
the
child
see
in
,
or
hear
from
those
,
who
be
most
concerned
to
inculcate
good
precept
into
his
mind
.
<EOS>
and
where
it
be
so
,
a
home
education
must
not
surely
be
choose
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
,
as
well
as
my
slender
ability
will
permit
,
presume
to
deliver
my
opinion
upon
three
great
point
,
viz
.
<EOS>
the
qualification
of
a
tutor
;
the
necessity
of
have
an
eye
to
the
moral
of
servant
;
and
the
example
of
parent
(
all
which
,
be
take
care
of
,
will
give
a
preference
,
as
I
imagine
,
to
a
home
education
)
;
permit
me
,
dear
Sir
,
to
speak
a
little
further
to
a
point
,
that
I
have
already
touch
upon
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
that
of
emulation
;
which
I
humbly
conceive
to
be
of
great
efficacy
to
lead
child
on
in
their
duty
and
study
.
<EOS>
and
how
,
dear
Sir
,
shall
this
advantage
be
procure
for
a
young
master
,
who
have
no
school
-
fellow
and
who
have
no
example
to
follow
,
but
that
of
his
tutor
,
whom
he
can
not
,
from
the
disparity
of
year
,
and
other
circumstance
,
without
pain
(
because
of
this
disparity
)
,
think
of
emulate
?
<EOS>
and
this
,
I
conceive
,
be
a
very
great
advantage
to
such
a
school
education
,
as
I
mention
in
my
former
letter
,
where
there
be
no
more
scholar
take
in
,
than
the
master
can
with
ease
and
pleasure
instruct
.
  
<EOS>
but
one
way
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
be
leave
to
answer
this
objection
,
and
still
preserve
the
reason
for
the
preference
which
Mr.
Locke
give
to
a
home
education
;
and
that
is
,
what
I
formerly
hint
,
to
take
into
your
family
the
child
of
some
honest
neighbour
of
but
middling
circumstance
,
and
like
age
of
your
own
,
but
who
should
give
apparent
indication
of
his
natural
promptitude
,
ingenuous
temper
,
oblige
behaviour
and
good
manner
;
and
to
let
him
go
hand
-
in
-
hand
with
yours
in
his
several
study
and
lesson
under
the
same
tutor
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
would
be
sensible
of
the
benefit
,
as
well
as
of
the
distinction
,
he
receive
,
and
consequently
of
what
be
expect
from
him
,
and
would
double
his
diligence
,
and
exert
all
his
good
quality
,
which
would
inspire
the
young
gentleman
with
the
wish
-
for
emulation
,
and
,
as
I
imagine
,
would
be
so
promotive
of
his
learning
,
that
it
would
greatly
compensate
the
tutor
for
his
pain
with
the
additional
scholar
;
for
the
young
gentleman
would
be
ashamed
to
be
outdo
by
one
of
like
year
and
stature
with
himself
.
<EOS>
and
little
reward
may
be
propose
to
the
great
proficient
,
in
order
to
heighten
the
emulation
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
Sir
,
the
generosity
of
such
a
method
,
to
a
gentleman
of
your
fortune
,
and
beneficent
mind
,
would
be
its
own
reward
,
be
there
no
other
benefit
to
be
receive
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
such
an
ingenious
youth
might
,
by
his
good
moral
and
industry
,
hereafter
be
of
service
,
in
some
place
of
trust
in
the
family
;
or
it
would
be
easy
for
a
gentleman
of
your
interest
in
the
world
,
if
such
a
thing
offer
not
,
to
provide
for
the
youth
in
the
navy
,
in
some
of
the
public
office
,
or
among
your
private
friend
.
<EOS>
if
he
prove
faulty
in
his
moral
,
his
dismission
would
be
in
your
own
power
,
and
would
be
punishment
enough
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
if
on
the
other
hand
,
he
prove
a
sober
and
hopeful
youth
,
he
would
make
an
excellent
companion
for
your
Billy
in
riper
year
;
as
he
would
be
,
in
a
manner
,
a
corroborator
of
his
moral
;
for
,
as
his
circumstance
would
not
support
him
in
any
extravagance
,
so
they
would
be
a
check
upon
his
inclination
;
and
this
be
second
by
the
hope
of
future
preferment
from
your
favour
and
interest
,
which
he
could
not
expect
but
upon
the
term
of
his
perseverance
in
virtue
,
he
would
find
himself
under
a
necessity
of
set
such
an
example
,
as
may
be
of
great
benefit
to
his
companion
,
who
should
be
watch
,
as
he
grow
up
,
that
he
do
not
(
if
his
ample
fortune
become
dangerous
to
his
virtue
)
contribute
out
of
his
affluence
to
draw
the
other
after
him
into
extravagance
.
<EOS>
and
to
this
end
,
as
I
humbly
conceive
,
the
noble
doctrine
of
independence
should
be
early
instill
into
both
their
mind
,
and
upon
all
occasion
,
inculcate
and
inforce
;
which
would
be
an
inducement
for
the
one
to
endeavour
to
improve
his
fortune
by
his
honest
industry
,
lest
he
never
be
enable
to
rise
out
of
a
state
of
dependence
;
and
to
the
other
,
to
keep
,
if
not
to
improve
,
his
own
,
lest
he
ever
fall
into
such
a
servile
state
,
and
thereby
lose
the
glorious
power
of
confer
happiness
on
the
deserving
,
one
of
the
high
pleasure
that
a
generous
mind
can
know
;
a
pleasure
,
Sir
,
which
you
have
oftener
experience
than
thousand
of
gentleman
:
and
which
may
you
still
continue
to
experience
for
a
long
and
happy
succession
of
year
,
be
the
prayer
of
one
,
the
most
obliged
of
all
other
in
her
own
person
,
as
well
as
in
the
person
of
her
dear
relation
,
and
who
owe
to
this
glorious
beneficence
the
honour
she
boast
,
of
be
your
ever
affectionate
and
grateful
P.B.
    
<EOS>
but
now
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
if
you
will
indulge
me
in
a
letter
or
two
more
,
preparative
to
my
little
book
,
I
will
take
the
liberty
to
touch
upon
one
or
two
other
place
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
differ
from
this
learn
gentleman
.
<EOS>
but
first
,
permit
me
to
observe
,
that
if
parent
be
,
above
all
thing
,
to
avoid
give
bad
example
to
their
child
,
they
will
be
no
less
careful
to
shun
the
practice
of
such
fond
father
and
mother
,
as
be
will
not
to
indulge
their
child
in
bad
habit
,
and
give
them
their
head
,
at
a
time
when
,
like
wax
,
their
tender
mind
may
be
mould
into
what
shape
they
please
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
point
that
,
if
it
please
God
,
I
will
carefully
attend
to
,
because
it
be
the
foundation
on
which
the
superstructure
of
the
whole
future
man
be
to
be
erect
.
<EOS>
for
,
accord
as
he
be
indulge
or
check
in
his
childish
folly
,
a
ground
be
lay
for
his
future
happiness
or
misery
;
and
if
once
they
be
suffer
to
become
habitual
to
him
,
it
can
not
but
be
expect
,
that
they
will
grow
up
with
him
,
and
that
they
will
hardly
ever
be
eradicate
.
<EOS>
"
try
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Locke
,
speak
to
this
very
point
,
"
in
a
dog
,
or
a
horse
,
or
any
other
creature
,
and
see
whether
the
ill
and
resty
trick
they
have
learn
when
young
,
be
easily
to
be
mend
,
when
they
be
knit
;
and
yet
none
of
these
creature
be
half
so
wilful
and
proud
,
or
half
so
desirous
to
be
master
of
themselves
,
as
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
this
bring
me
,
dear
Sir
,
to
the
head
of
punishment
,
in
which
,
as
well
as
in
the
article
of
reward
,
which
I
have
touch
upon
,
I
have
a
little
objection
to
what
Mr.
Locke
advance
.
  
<EOS>
but
permit
me
,
however
,
to
premise
,
that
I
be
exceedingly
pleased
with
the
method
lay
down
by
this
excellent
writer
,
rather
to
shame
the
child
out
of
his
fault
,
than
beat
him
;
which
latter
serve
generally
for
nothing
but
to
harden
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
obstinacy
,
and
tell
a
lie
,
and
commit
a
wilful
fault
,
and
then
persist
in
it
,
be
,
I
agree
with
this
gentleman
,
the
only
cause
for
which
the
child
should
be
punish
with
stripe
:
<EOS>
and
I
admire
the
reason
he
give
against
a
too
rigorous
and
severe
treatment
of
child
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
give
Mr.
Locke
's
word
,
to
which
I
have
some
objection
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
doubt
,
"
say
he
,
"
concern
whipping
,
when
,
as
the
last
remedy
,
it
come
to
be
necessary
,
at
what
time
,
and
by
whom
,
it
should
be
do
;
whether
presently
,
upon
the
commit
the
fault
,
whilst
it
be
yet
fresh
and
hot
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
should
not
be
do
presently
,
"
add
he
,
"
lest
passion
mingle
with
it
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
though
it
exceed
the
just
proportion
,
yet
it
lose
of
its
due
weight
.
<EOS>
for
even
child
discern
whenever
we
do
thing
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
must
beg
leave
,
dear
Sir
,
to
differ
from
Mr.
Locke
in
this
point
;
for
I
think
it
ought
rather
to
be
a
rule
with
parent
,
who
shall
chastise
their
child
,
to
conquer
what
would
be
extreme
in
their
own
passion
on
this
occasion
(
for
those
who
can
not
do
it
,
be
very
unfit
to
be
the
punisher
of
the
wayward
passion
of
their
child
)
,
than
to
defer
the
punishment
,
especially
if
the
child
know
its
fault
have
reach
its
parent
's
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
otherwise
,
methink
,
give
the
child
,
if
of
an
obstinate
disposition
,
so
much
more
time
to
harden
its
mind
,
and
bid
defiance
to
its
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
just
now
,
dear
Sir
,
your
Billy
be
bring
into
my
presence
,
all
smile
,
crow
to
come
to
me
,
and
full
of
heart
-
cheer
promise
;
and
the
subject
I
be
upon
go
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
surely
I
can
never
beat
your
Billy
!
 
<EOS>
dear
little
life
of
my
life
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
think
thou
canst
ever
deserve
it
,
or
that
I
can
ever
inflict
it
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
my
baby
,
that
shall
be
thy
papa
's
task
,
if
ever
thou
art
so
heinously
naughty
;
and
whatever
he
do
,
must
be
right
.
<EOS>
pardon
my
foolish
fondness
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
then
,
the
fault
be
so
atrocious
as
to
deserve
whipping
,
and
the
parent
be
resolve
on
this
exemplary
punishment
,
the
child
ought
not
,
as
I
imagine
,
to
come
into
one
's
presence
without
meet
with
it
:
or
else
,
a
fondness
too
natural
to
be
resist
,
will
probably
get
the
upper
hand
of
one
's
resentment
,
and
how
shall
one
be
able
to
whip
the
dear
creature
one
have
cease
to
be
angry
with
?
<EOS>
then
after
he
have
once
see
one
without
meet
his
punishment
,
will
he
not
be
incline
to
hope
for
connivance
at
his
fault
,
unless
it
should
be
repeat
?
<EOS>
and
may
he
not
be
apt
<EOS>
(
for
child
's
resentment
be
strong
)
to
impute
to
cruelty
a
correction
(
when
he
think
the
fault
have
be
forget
)
that
should
always
appear
to
be
inflict
with
reluctance
,
and
through
motive
of
love
?
  
<EOS>
if
,
from
anger
at
his
fault
,
one
should
go
above
the
due
proportion
,
(
I
be
sure
I
may
be
trust
for
this
!
)
<EOS>
let
it
take
its
course
!
 
<EOS>
how
barbarously
,
methink
,
I
speak
!
 
<EOS>
He
ought
to
feel
the
lash
,
first
,
because
he
deserve
it
,
poor
little
soul
?
<EOS>
next
,
because
it
be
propose
to
be
exemplary
.
<EOS>
and
,
lastly
,
because
it
be
not
intend
to
be
often
use
:
and
the
very
passion
or
displeasure
one
express
(
if
it
be
not
enormous
)
will
shew
one
be
in
earnest
,
and
create
in
him
a
necessary
awe
,
and
fear
to
offend
again
.
<EOS>
the
end
of
the
correction
be
to
shew
him
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
.
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
proper
to
take
him
at
his
first
offer
of
a
full
submission
and
repentance
(
and
not
before
)
,
and
instantly
dispassionate
one
's
self
,
and
shew
him
the
difference
by
act
of
pardon
and
kindness
(
which
will
let
him
see
that
one
punish
him
out
of
necessity
rather
than
choice
)
,
so
one
would
not
be
afraid
to
make
him
smart
so
sufficiently
,
that
he
should
not
soon
forget
the
severity
of
the
discipline
,
nor
the
disgrace
of
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
cruel
mamma
for
you
,
Mr.
B.
!
<EOS>
what
my
practice
may
be
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
this
theory
,
I
presume
to
think
,
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
act
itself
,
I
much
approve
Mr.
Locke
's
advice
,
to
do
it
by
pause
,
mingle
stripe
and
expostulation
together
,
to
shame
and
terrify
the
more
;
and
the
rather
,
as
the
parent
,
by
this
slow
manner
of
inflict
the
punishment
,
will
less
need
to
be
afraid
of
give
too
violent
a
correction
;
for
those
pause
will
afford
him
,
as
well
as
the
child
,
opportunity
for
consideration
and
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
person
,
by
whom
the
discipline
should
be
perform
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
that
this
excellent
author
be
here
also
to
be
object
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
a
discreet
servant
,
"
say
he
,
"
capable
of
it
,
and
have
the
place
of
govern
your
child
(
for
if
you
have
a
tutor
,
there
be
no
doubt
)
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
be
best
the
smart
should
come
immediately
from
another
's
hand
,
though
by
the
parent
's
order
,
who
should
see
it
do
,
whereby
the
parent
's
authority
will
be
preserve
,
and
the
child
's
aversion
for
the
pain
it
suffer
,
rather
be
turn
on
the
person
that
immediately
inflict
it
.
<EOS>
for
I
would
have
a
father
seldom
strike
a
child
,
but
upon
very
urgent
necessity
,
and
as
the
last
remedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
@@@Tis
<EOS>
in
such
an
urgent
case
that
we
be
suppose
that
it
should
be
do
at
all
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
not
a
reason
strong
enough
for
the
father
's
whip
the
child
himself
,
there
can
not
be
one
for
his
ordering
another
to
do
it
,
and
stand
by
to
see
it
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
humbly
think
,
that
if
there
be
a
necessity
,
no
one
can
be
so
fit
as
the
father
himself
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
the
child
can
not
dispute
his
authority
to
punish
,
from
whom
he
receive
and
expect
all
the
good
thing
of
his
life
:
he
can
not
question
his
love
to
him
,
and
after
the
smart
be
over
,
and
his
obedience
secure
,
must
believe
that
so
tender
,
so
indulgent
<EOS>
a
father
could
have
no
other
end
in
whip
him
,
but
his
good
.
<EOS>
against
him
,
he
know
he
have
no
remedy
,
but
must
passively
submit
;
and
when
he
be
convinced
he
must
,
he
will
in
time
conclude
that
he
ought
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
have
this
severe
office
perform
by
a
servant
,
though
at
the
father
's
command
,
and
that
professedly
,
that
the
aversion
of
the
child
for
the
pain
it
suffer
should
be
turn
on
the
person
who
immediately
inflict
it
,
be
<EOS>
,
I
humbly
think
,
the
reverse
of
what
ought
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
and
more
so
,
if
this
servant
have
any
direction
of
the
child
's
education
;
and
still
much
more
so
,
if
it
be
his
tutor
,
though
Mr.
Locke
say
,
there
be
no
doubt
,
if
there
be
a
tutor
,
that
it
should
be
do
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
dear
Sir
,
be
there
no
doubt
,
that
the
tutor
should
lay
himself
open
to
the
aversion
of
the
child
,
whose
manner
he
be
to
form
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
good
method
a
tutor
can
take
,
in
order
to
enforce
the
lesson
he
would
inculcate
,
to
try
to
attract
the
love
and
attention
of
his
pupil
by
the
most
win
way
he
can
possibly
think
of
?
<EOS>
and
yet
be
he
,
this
very
tutor
out
of
all
doubt
,
to
be
the
instrument
of
do
an
harsh
and
disgraceful
thing
,
and
that
in
the
last
resort
,
when
all
other
method
be
find
ineffectual
;
and
that
too
,
because
he
ought
to
incur
the
child
's
resentment
and
aversion
,
rather
than
the
father
?
<EOS>
no
,
surely
,
Sir
,
it
be
not
reasonable
it
should
be
so
:
<EOS>
quite
contrary
,
in
my
humble
notion
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
,
but
that
it
should
be
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
It
should
,
methink
,
be
enough
for
a
tutor
,
in
case
of
a
fault
in
the
child
,
to
threaten
to
complain
to
his
father
;
but
yet
not
to
make
such
a
complaint
,
without
the
child
obstinately
persist
in
his
error
,
which
,
too
,
should
be
of
a
nature
to
merit
such
an
appeal
:
and
this
may
highly
contribute
to
preserve
the
parent
's
authority
;
who
,
on
this
occasion
,
should
never
fail
of
extort
a
promise
of
amendment
,
or
of
instantly
punish
him
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
soften
the
distaste
he
may
conceive
in
resentment
of
too
rigid
complaining
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
,
that
his
interposition
in
the
child
's
favour
,
be
the
fault
not
too
flagrant
,
should
be
permit
to
save
him
once
or
twice
from
the
impending
discipline
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
certain
that
the
passion
,
if
I
may
so
call
them
,
of
affection
and
aversion
,
be
very
early
discoverable
in
child
;
insomuch
that
they
will
,
even
before
they
can
speak
,
afford
us
mark
for
the
detection
of
an
hypocritical
appearance
of
love
to
it
before
the
parent
"
face
.
<EOS>
for
the
fondness
or
averseness
of
the
child
to
some
servant
,
will
at
any
time
let
one
know
,
whether
their
love
to
the
baby
be
uniform
and
the
same
,
when
one
be
absent
,
as
present
.
<EOS>
in
one
case
the
child
will
reject
with
sullenness
all
the
little
sycophancy
make
to
it
in
one
's
sight
;
while
on
the
other
,
its
fondness
of
the
person
,
who
generally
oblige
it
,
be
an
infallible
rule
to
judge
of
such
an
one
's
sincerity
behind
one
be
back
.
<EOS>
this
little
observation
shew
the
strength
of
a
child
's
resentment
,
and
its
sagacity
,
at
the
early
age
,
in
discover
who
oblige
,
and
who
disoblige
it
:
and
hence
one
may
infer
,
how
improper
a
person
he
be
,
whom
we
would
have
a
child
to
love
and
respect
,
or
by
whose
precept
we
would
have
it
direct
,
to
be
the
punisher
of
its
fault
,
or
to
do
any
harsh
or
disagreeable
office
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
beg
to
declare
,
that
if
the
parent
be
not
to
inflict
the
punishment
himself
,
I
think
it
much
well
it
should
be
give
him
,
in
the
parent
's
presence
,
by
the
servant
of
the
low
consideration
in
the
family
,
and
whose
manner
and
example
one
would
be
the
least
willing
of
any
other
he
should
follow
.
<EOS>
just
as
the
common
executioner
,
who
be
the
low
and
most
flagitious
officer
of
the
commonwealth
,
and
who
frequently
deserve
,
as
much
as
the
criminal
,
the
punishment
he
be
choose
to
inflict
,
be
pitch
upon
to
perform
,
as
a
mark
of
great
ignominy
,
sentence
intend
as
example
to
deter
other
from
the
commission
of
heinous
crime
.
<EOS>
the
Almighty
take
this
method
when
he
be
dispose
to
correct
severely
his
choose
people
;
for
,
in
that
case
,
he
generally
do
it
by
the
hand
of
the
most
profligate
nation
around
them
,
as
we
read
in
many
place
of
the
Old
Testament
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
follow
rule
I
admire
in
Mr.
Locke
:
"
when
,
"
say
he
(
for
any
misdemeanour
)
,
"
the
father
or
mother
look
sour
on
the
child
,
every
one
else
should
put
on
the
same
coldness
to
him
,
and
nobody
give
him
countenance
till
forgiveness
be
ask
,
and
a
reformation
of
his
fault
have
set
him
right
again
,
and
restore
him
to
his
former
credit
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
constantly
observe
,
"
add
he
,
"
I
guess
there
would
be
little
need
of
blow
or
chiding
:
their
own
ease
or
satisfaction
would
quickly
teach
child
to
court
commendation
,
and
avoid
do
that
which
they
find
every
body
condemn
,
and
they
be
sure
to
suffer
for
,
without
be
chid
or
beat
.
<EOS>
this
would
teach
them
modesty
and
shame
,
and
they
would
quickly
come
to
have
a
natural
abhorrence
for
that
which
they
find
make
them
slight
and
neglect
by
every
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
afford
me
a
pretty
hint
;
for
if
ever
your
charming
Billy
shall
be
naughty
,
I
will
proclaim
throughout
your
worthy
family
,
that
the
little
dear
be
in
disgrace
!
<EOS>
and
one
shall
shun
him
,
another
decline
answer
him
,
a
third
say
,
"
no
,
master
,
I
can
not
obey
you
,
till
your
mamma
be
pleased
with
you
"
;
a
fourth
,
"
<EOS>
who
shall
mind
what
little
master
bid
them
do
,
when
they
will
not
mind
what
their
mamma
say
to
them
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
the
dear
little
soul
find
this
,
he
will
come
in
my
way
,
(
and
I
see
,
pardon
me

<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
he
have
some
of
his
papa
's
spirit

<EOS>
and
I
will
direct
myself
with
double
kindness
to
your
beloved
daver
,
and
to
my
Miss
Goodwin
,
and
not
notice
the

creature
,
if
I
can
help
it

till
I
can
see
his

(
forgive
my

banish
from
his
little
sullen
brow
,
and
all
his

rise
to
his

when
his
musical
tongue
shall
be
unlocked
to
own
his

and
promise
amendment

o

<EOS>
how
shall
I
clasp
him

tear

the
dawning

so

<EOS>
and
then
their
pretty

,
their
fond
and
grateful
endearment

some
new
beauty
every

rise
to
observation
 
<EOS>
o
my

Mr.

whose
enjoyment
and
pleasure
be
so
great

as
those
of
such

bend
their

the
duty

the
nursery

<EOS>
I
have
a
few
other
thing
to
observe
upon
Mr.
Locke
's
treatise
,
which
,
when
I
have
do
,
I
shall
read
,
admire
,
and
improve
by
the
rest
,
as
my
year
and
experience
advance
;
of
which
,
in
my
propose
little
book
,
I
shall
give
you
better
proof
than
I
be
able
to
do
at
present
;
raw
,
crude
,
and
indigeste
as
the
notion
of
so
young
a
mamma
must
needs
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
shall
be
the
subject
of
another
letter
;
for
now
I
be
come
to
the
pride
and
the
pleasure
I
always
have
,
when
I
subscribe
myself
,
dear
Sir
,
your
ever
dutiful
and
grateful
  
P.B.
    
dear
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
give
a
great
many
very
pretty
instruction
relate
to
the
play
-
game
of
child
:
but
I
humbly
presume
to
object
to
what
he
say
in
one
or
two
place
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
indulge
them
in
any
plaything
,
but
what
they
make
themselves
,
or
endeavour
to
make
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
smooth
pebble
,
a
piece
of
paper
,
the
mother
's
bunch
of
key
,
or
any
thing
they
can
not
hurt
themselves
with
<EOS>
,
"
he
rightly
say
,
"
serve
as
much
to
divert
little
child
,
as
those
more
chargeable
and
curious
toy
from
the
shop
,
which
be
presently
put
out
of
order
,
and
break
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
plaything
may
certainly
do
for
little
one
:
but
methinks
,
to
a
person
of
easy
circumstance
,
since
the
make
these
toy
employ
the
industrious
poor
,
the
buy
them
for
the
child
may
be
comply
with
,
though
they
be
easily
break
;
and
especially
as
they
be
of
all
price
,
and
some
less
costly
,
and
more
durable
than
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
top
,
gig
,
battledore
,
"
Mr.
Locke
observe
,
"
which
be
to
be
use
with
labour
,
should
indeed
be
procure
them
 
not
for
variety
,
but
exercise
;
but
if
they
have
a
top
,
the
scourge
-
stick
and
leather
strap
should
be
leave
to
their
own
making
and
fitting
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
may
presume
to
say
,
that
whatever
be
the
good
Mr.
Locke
propose
by
this
<EOS>
,
it
can
not
be
equal
to
the
mischief
child
may
do
themselves
in
make
these
plaything
!
<EOS>
for
must
they
not
have
implement
to
work
with
?
<EOS>
and
be
not
a
knife
,
or
other
edge
tool
,
without
which
it
be
impossible
they
can
make
or
shape
a
scourge
-
stick
,
or
any
of
their
plaything
,
a
fine
instrument
in
a
child
's
hand
!
<EOS>
this
advice
be
the
reverse
of
the
caution
warrant
from
all
antiquity
,
that
it
be
dangerous
to
meddle
with
edge
tool
!
<EOS>
and
I
be
afraid
,
the
tutor
must
often
act
the
surgeon
,
and
follow
the
indulgence
with
a
styptic
and
plaister
;
and
the
young
gentleman
's
hand
may
be
so
often
bind
up
as
to
be
one
way
to
cure
him
of
his
earnest
desire
to
play
;
but
I
can
hardly
imagine
any
other
good
that
it
can
do
him
;
for
I
doubt
the
excellent
consequence
propose
by
our
author
from
this
doctrine
,
such
as
to
teach
the
child
moderation
in
his
desire
,
application
,
industry
,
thought
,
contrivance
,
and
good
husbandry
,
quality
that
,
as
he
say
,
will
be
useful
to
him
when
he
be
a
man
,
be
too
remote
to
be
ingraft
upon
such
beginning
;
although
it
must
be
confess
,
that
,
as
Mr.
Locke
wisely
observe
,
good
habit
and
industry
can
not
be
too
early
inculcate
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
,
Sir
,
may
I
ask
,
be
not
the
very
play
and
sport
,
to
which
child
accustom
themselves
,
whether
they
make
their
own
plaything
or
not
,
equivalent
to
the
work
or
labour
of
grown
person
!
<EOS>
yes
,
Sir
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
they
be
,
and
more
than
equivalent
to
the
exercise
and
labour
of
many
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
advise
,
that
the
child
's
plaything
should
be
as
few
as
possible
,
which
I
entirely
approve
:
that
they
should
be
in
his
tutor
's
power
,
who
be
to
give
him
but
one
at
once
.
<EOS>
but
since
it
be
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
to
court
most
what
be
prohibit
,
and
to
set
light
by
what
be
in
its
own
power
;
I
be
half
doubtful
(
only
that
Mr.
Locke
say
it
,
and
it
may
not
be
so
very
important
as
other
point
,
in
which
I
have
venture
to
differ
from
that
gentleman
)
,
whether
the
child
's
absolute
possession
of
his
own
plaything
in
some
little
repository
,
of
which
he
may
be
permit
to
keep
the
key
,
especially
if
he
make
no
bad
use
of
the
privilege
,
would
not
make
him
more
indifferent
to
them
:
while
the
contrary
conduct
may
possibly
enhance
his
value
of
them
.
<EOS>
and
if
,
when
he
have
do
with
any
plaything
,
he
be
oblige
to
put
it
into
its
allotted
place
,
and
be
accustomed
to
keep
account
of
the
number
and
place
of
them
severally
;
this
would
teach
him
order
,
and
at
the
same
time
instruct
him
to
keep
a
proper
account
of
them
,
and
to
avoid
be
a
squanderer
or
waster
:
and
if
he
should
omit
to
put
his
plaything
in
their
place
,
or
be
careless
of
them
,
<EOS>
the
take
them
away
for
a
time
,
or
threaten
to
give
them
to
other
,
would
make
him
the
more
heedful
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
say
,
that
he
have
know
a
child
so
distract
with
the
number
and
variety
of
his
plaything
,
that
he
tire
his
maid
every
day
to
look
them
over
:
and
be
so
accustomed
to
abundance
,
that
he
never
think
he
have
enough
,
but
be
always
ask
,
"
what
more
?
<EOS>
what
new
thing
shall
I
have
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
good
introduction
,
"
add
he
,
ironically
,
"
to
moderate
desire
,
and
the
ready
way
to
make
a
content
happy
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
all
that
I
shall
offer
to
this
,
be
,
that
few
man
be
so
philosophical
as
one
would
wish
them
to
be
,
much
less
child
.
<EOS>
but
,
no
doubt
,
this
variety
engage
the
child
's
activity
;
which
,
of
the
two
may
be
turn
to
well
purpose
than
sloth
or
indolence
;
and
if
the
maid
be
tired
,
it
may
be
,
because
she
be
not
so
much
alive
as
the
child
;
and
perhaps
this
part
of
the
grievance
may
not
be
so
great
,
because
if
she
be
his
attendant
,
'
tis
probable
she
have
nothing
else
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
in
the
main
,
as
Mr.
Locke
say
,
it
be
no
matter
how
few
plaything
the
child
be
indulge
with
;
but
yet
I
can
hardly
persuade
myself
,
that
plenty
of
them
can
have
such
bad
consequence
as
he
apprehend
;
and
the
rather
,
because
they
will
excite
his
attention
,
and
promote
his
industry
and
activity
.
<EOS>
His
enquiry
after
new
thing
,
let
him
have
few
or
many
,
be
to
be
expect
as
a
consequence
to
those
natural
desire
which
be
implant
in
him
,
and
will
every
day
increase
:
but
this
may
be
observe
,
that
as
he
grow
in
year
,
he
will
be
above
some
plaything
,
and
so
the
number
of
the
old
one
will
be
always
reducible
,
perhaps
in
a
great
proportion
,
than
the
new
one
will
increase
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
head
of
good
-
breeding
,
he
observe
,
that
,
"
there
be
two
sort
of
ill
-
breeding
;
the
one
a
sheepish
bashfulness
,
and
the
other
a
misbecome
negligence
and
disrespect
in
our
carriage
;
both
which
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
avoid
by
duly
observe
this
one
rule
,
not
to
think
meanly
of
ourselves
,
and
not
to
think
meanly
of
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
as
Mr.
Locke
explain
this
rule
,
it
be
an
excellent
one
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
beg
to
observe
upon
it
,
that
however
discommendable
a
bashful
temper
be
,
in
some
instance
,
where
it
must
be
deem
a
weakness
of
the
mind
,
yet
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
it
be
generally
the
mark
of
an
ingenuous
one
,
and
be
always
to
be
prefer
to
an
undistinguishing
and
hardy
confidence
,
which
,
as
it
seem
to
me
,
be
the
genuine
production
of
invincible
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
faulty
in
it
,
which
he
call
sheepishness
,
should
indeed
be
shake
off
as
soon
as
possible
,
because
it
be
an
enemy
to
merit
in
its
advancement
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
be
I
to
choose
a
companion
for
your
Billy
,
as
he
grow
up
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
think
the
bad
of
the
youth
,
who
,
not
have
have
the
opportunity
of
know
man
,
or
see
the
world
,
have
this
defect
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
should
be
apt
to
look
upon
it
as
an
outward
fence
or
inclosure
to
his
virtue
,
which
may
keep
off
the
light
attack
of
immorality
,
the
hussar
of
vice
,
as
I
may
say
,
who
be
not
able
to
carry
on
a
formal
siege
against
his
moral
;
and
I
should
expect
such
a
one
to
be
docile
,
humane
,
good
-
humoured
,
diffident
of
himself
,
and
therefore
most
likely
to
improve
as
well
in
mind
as
behaviour
:
while
a
harden
mind
,
that
never
doubt
itself
,
must
be
a
stranger
to
its
own
infirmity
,
and
suspect
none
,
be
impetuous
,
over
-
bearing
,
incorrigible
;
and
,
if
rich
,
a
tyrant
;
if
not
,
possibly
an
invader
of
other
man
's
property
;
or
at
least
,
such
a
one
as
allow
itself
to
walk
so
near
the
border
of
injustice
,
that
where
self
be
concern
,
it
hardly
ever
do
right
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
propose
(
section
148
)
a
very
pretty
method
to
cheat
child
,
as
it
be
,
into
learning
:
but
then
he
add
,
"
there
may
be
dice
and
plaything
,
with
the
letter
on
them
,
to
teach
child
the
alphabet
by
play
.
"
<EOS>
and
(
section
151
)
"
<EOS>
I
know
a
person
of
great
quality
,
who
,
by
paste
on
the
six
vowel
(
for
in
our
language
y
be
one
)
on
the
six
side
of
a
dice
,
and
the
remain
eighteen
consonant
on
the
side
of
three
other
dice
,
have
make
this
a
play
for
his
child
,
that
he
shall
win
,
who
at
one
cast
throw
most
word
on
these
four
dice
;
whereby
his
eld
son
,
yet
in
coat
,
have
play
himself
into
spelling
with
great
eagerness
,
and
without
once
have
be
chid
for
it
,
or
force
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
have
rather
<EOS>
your
Billy
should
be
a
twelvemonth
backwarder
for
want
of
this
method
,
than
forward
by
it
.
<EOS>
for
what
may
not
be
fear
from
so
early
inculcate
the
use
of
dice
and
gaming
,
upon
the
mind
of
child
?
<EOS>
let
Mr.
Locke
himself
speak
to
this
in
his
section
208
,
and
I
wish
I
could
reconcile
the
two
passage
in
this
excellent
author
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
card
and
dice
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
safe
and
good
way
be
,
never
to
learn
any
play
upon
them
,
and
so
to
be
incapacitate
for
these
dangerous
temptation
,
and
encroach
waster
of
useful
time
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
he
may
have
add
,
of
the
noble
estate
and
fortune
;
while
sharper
and
scoundrel
have
be
lift
into
distinction
upon
their
ruin
.
<EOS>
yet
,
in
Sec
.
<EOS>
153
,
Mr.
Locke
proceed
to
give
direction
in
relation
to
the
dice
he
recommend
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
all
,
if
some
innocent
play
be
fix
upon
to
cheat
child
into
reading
,
that
,
as
he
say
,
should
look
as
little
like
a
task
as
possible
,
it
must
needs
be
of
use
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
let
every
gentleman
,
who
have
a
fortune
to
lose
,
and
who
,
if
he
game
,
be
on
a
foot
with
the
vile
company
,
who
generally
have
nothing
at
all
to
risque
,
tremble
at
the
thought
of
teach
his
son
,
though
for
the
most
laudable
purpose
,
the
early
use
of
dice
and
gaming
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
much
I
be
charm
with
a
hint
in
Mr.
Locke
,
which
make
your
Pamela
hope
<EOS>
,
she
may
be
of
great
use
to
your
child

even
as
they
grow
up

than
she
could
ever
have
flatter
herself
to
be
.

tis

a
charming
paragraph
;
I
must
not
skip
one
word
of
it

I
will
observe
upon
it
as
I
go
along

"
but
under
whose

soever
a
child
be
put
to
be
teach
,
during
the
tender
and
flexible
year
of
his
life
,
this
be
certain
,
it
should
be
one
who
think
Latin
and

the
least
part

<EOS>
how
agreeable
be
this
to
my
notion

which
I
durst
not
have
avow

after
so
excellent
a

I
have
long

the

much

be
waste
to
little
purpose

attaining

Mr.

I

say
he
be
ten
year
in
endeavour
to
learn
it
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
find
,
know
nothing
at
all
of
the
matter
neither

indeed
he
lay
that
to
the
wicked
picture
in
his
grammar

which
he
take
for
grant
(
as
he
have
often

as
well

once
write

put
there
to
teach
boy
to
rob
orchard

you

you

tell
me
often

I
read

pronounce
Latin
more

Mr.

mention
other
advantage

the

may
receive
from
his

instruction

I
will
try
more

more
to
qualify
myself
for

particularly

after
he
have
intimate

that

at

learn
french

he

proceed

geography

I

<EOS>
I
remember
,
Sir

formerly

in
that
sweet
chariot
conference
,
at
the
dawning
of
my
hope
,
when
all
my
danger
be
happily
over
(
a
conference
I
shall
always
think
of
with
pleasure
)
,
that
you
ask
me
,
how
I
would
bestow
my
time
,
suppose
the
neighbouring
lady
would
be
above
be
see
in
my
company
;
when
I
should
have
no
visit
to
receive
or
return
;
no
party
of
pleasure
to
join
in
;
no
card
-
table
to
employ
my
winter
evening
?
  
<EOS>
I
then
,
Sir
,
transport
with
my
opening
prospect
,
prattle
to
you
,
how
well
I
would
try
to
pass
my
time
,
in
the
family
management
and
account
,
in
visit
now
and
then
to
the
indigent
and
worthy
poor

in
music
sometimes
;
in
reading
,
in
writing
,
in
my
superior
duty
 
<EOS>

I
hope
I
have
not
behave
quite
unworthily
of
my
promise

<EOS>
but
I
also
remember
,
<EOS>
what
once
you
say
on
a
certain
occasion
,
which
now
,
since
the
fair
prospect
be
no
longer
distant

that
I
have
be
so
long
your
happy

I
may
repeat
without
those
blush

cover
my

thus
then

with
a
modest

with

virtuous
endearment

you

such
an

"
in
short
,
Sir

I
be
now
bless
with
,

writing
of
;
no
less

the
useful
part
I
may
be
able
to
take
in
the
first
education
of
your
beloved
baby

<EOS>
and
now
I
must
add
,
that
this
pleasing
hope
set
me
above
all
other
diversion
<EOS>
:
I
wish
for
no
party
of
pleasure
but
with
you
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.

and
these
be
party
that
will
improve
me
,
and
make
me
more
capable
of
the
other
,
and
more
worthy
of
your
conversation
,
and
of
the
time
you
pass
(
beyond
what
I
could
ever
have
promise
to
my
utmost
wish
)
in
such
poor
company
as
mine
,
for
no
other
reason

but
because
I
love
to
be
instruct
,
and
take
my
lesson
well
,
as
you
be
pleased
to
say
;
and
indeed
I
must
be
a
sad
dunce

if
I
do
not
,
from
so
skilful

so
beloved
a
master

<EOS>
I
want
no
card

table
amusement

for
I
hope
,
in
a
few
year
(
and
a
proud
hope
it
be
)
,
to
be
able
to
teach
your
dear
little
one
the
first
rudiment
,
as
Mr.

point
the
way
,
of
Latin

of
French

and
of
geography

and
arithmetic
.
  
<EOS>
o

my
dear
Mr.
B.

by
your
help
and
countenance
,
what
may
I
not
be
able
to
teach
them
,
and
how
may
I
prepare
the
way
for
a
tutor
's
instruction
,
and
give
him
up
mind
half
cultivate
to
his
hand
!
 
<EOS>
and
all
this
time
improve
myself
too
,
not
only
in
science
,
but
in
nature
,
by
trace
in
the
little
babe
what
all
mankind
be
,
and
have
be
,
from
infancy
to
riper
year

and
watch
the
sweet
dawning
of
reason

and
delight
in
every
bright
emanation
of
that
ray
of
divinity

lend
to
the
human
mind

for
great
and
happy
purpose
,
when
rightly
point
and
direct
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
go
farther
after
these
charming
recollection
and
hope
,
for
they
bring
me
to
that
grateful
remembrance
,
to
whom
,
under
God
,
I
owe
them
all
,
and
also
what
I
have
be
for
so
happy
a
period
,
and
what
I
be
,
which
will
ever
be
my
pride
and
my
glory
;
and
well
it
may
,
when
I
look
back

my
beginning

humble
acknowledgment

can
call
myself

dearest

your
honour

honour

useful

P.B.
    
my
DEAREST
MR
.
<EOS>
B.
,
  
have
in
my
former
letter
say
as
much
as
be
necessary
to
let
you
into
my
notion
of
the
excellent
book
you
put
into
my
hand
,
and
have
touch
those
point
in
which
the
child
of
both
sex
may
be
concern
(
with
some
art
in
my
intention
,
I
own
)
,
in
hope
that
they
would
not
be
so
much
out
of
the
way
,
as
to
make
you
repent
of
the
honour
you
have
do
me
,
in
commit
the
dear
Miss
Goodwin
to
my
care
;
I
shall
now
very
quickly
set
myself
about
the
propose
little
book
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
<EOS>
(
at
the
same
time
that
you
disapprove
not
these
my
speciman
letter
as
I
may
call
them
)
,
that
you
will
kindly
accept
of
my
intend
present
,
and
encourage
me
to
proceed
in
it
;
and
as
I
shall
leave
one
side
of
the
leaf
blank
for
your
correction
and
alteration
,
those
correction
will
be
a
fine
help
and
instruction
to
me
in
the
pleasing
task
which
I
propose
to
myself
,
of
assist
in
the
early
education
of
your
dear
child
.
<EOS>
and
as
I
may
be
year
in
write
it
,
as
the
dear
baby
improve
,
as
I
myself
improve
,
by
the
opportunity
which
their
advance
in
year
will
give
me
,
and
the
experience
I
shall
gain
,
I
may
then
venture
to
give
my
notion
on
the
more
material
and
noble
part
of
education
,
as
well
as
the
inferior
:
for
(
but
that
I
think
the
subject
above
my
present
ability
)
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
's
book
would
lead
me
into
several
remark
,
that
may
not
be
unuseful
,
and
which
appear
to
me
entirely
new
;
though
that
may
be
owe
to
my
slender
reading
and
opportunity
,
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
I
would
now
touch
upon
,
be
a
word
or
two
still
more
particularly
upon
the
education
of
my
own
sex
;
a
topic
which
naturally
arise
to
me
from
the
subject
of
my
last
letter
.
<EOS>
for
there
,
dear
Sir
,
we
see
,
that
the
mother
may
teach
the
child
this
part
of
science
,
and
that
part
of
instruction
;
and
who
,
I
pray
,
as
our
sex
be
generally
educate
,
shall
teach
the
mother
?
<EOS>
how
,
in
a
word
,
shall
they
come
by
their
knowledge
?
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
be
apt
to
say
,
that
Miss
Goodwin
give
all
the
promise
of
become
a
fine
young
lady
,
and
take
her
learning
,
love
reading
,
and
make
very
pretty
reflection
upon
all
she
read
,
and
ask
very
pertinent
question
,
and
be
as
know
,
at
her
year
,
as
most
young
lady
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
true
,
Sir
;
but
it
be
not
every
one
that
can
boast
of
Miss
Goodwin
's
capacity
,
and
goodness
of
temper
,
which
have
enable
her
to
get
up
a
good
deal
of
lose
time
,
as
I
must
call
it
;
for
her
first
four
year
be
a
perfect
blank
,
as
far
as
I
can
find
,
just
as
if
the
pretty
dear
be
bear
the
day
she
be
four
year
old
;
for
what
she
have
to
unlearn
as
to
temper
,
and
will
,
and
such
thing
,
set
against
what
little
improvement
she
have
make
,
may
very
fairly
be
compound
for
,
as
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
indeed
have
a
girl
bring
up
to
her
needle
,
but
I
would
not
have
all
her
time
employ
in
sampler
,
and
learn
to
mark
,
and
do
those
unnecessary
thing
,
which
she
will
never
,
probably
,
be
call
upon
to
practise
.
  
<EOS>
and
why
,
pray
,
be
not
girl
entitle
to
the
same
first
education
,
though
not
to
the
same
play
and
diversion
,
as
boy
;
so
far
,
at
least
,
as
be
suppose
by
Mr.
Locke
<EOS>
a
mother
can
instruct
them
?
  
<EOS>
Would
not
this
lay
a
foundation
for
their
future
improvement
,
and
direct
their
inclination
to
useful
subject
,
such
as
would
make
them
above
the
imputation
of
some
unkind
gentleman
,
who
allot
to
their
part
common
tea
-
table
prattle
,
while
they
do
all
they
can
to
make
them
fit
for
nothing
else
,
and
then
upbraid
them
for
it
?
<EOS>
and
would
not
the
man
find
us
well
and
more
suitable
companion
and
assistant
to
them
in
every
useful
purpose
of
life
?
 
<EOS>
o
that
your
lordly
sex
be
all
like
my
dear
<EOS>
Mr.
B.
 
I
do
not
mean
that
they
should
all
take
raw
,
uncouth
,
unbred
,
lowly
girl
,
as
I
be
,
from
the
cottage
,
and
,
destroy
all
distinction
<EOS>
,
make
such
their
wife
;
for
there
be
a
far
great
likelihood
,
that
such
a
one
,
when
she
come
to
be
lift
up
into
so
dazzle
a
sphere
,
would
have
her
head
make
giddy
with
her
exaltation
,
than
that
she
would
balance
herself
well
in
it
:
and
to
what
a
blot
,
over
all
the
fair
page
of
a
long
life
,
would
this
little
drop
of
dirty
ink
spread
itself
!
<EOS>
what
a
stand
disreputation
to
the
choice
of
a
gentleman
!
  
<EOS>
but
this
I
mean
,
that
after
a
gentleman
have
enter
into
the
marriage
state
with
a
young
creature
(
say
nothing
at
all
of
birth
or
descent
)
far
inferior
to
him
in
learning
,
in
part
,
in
knowledge
of
the
world
,
and
in
all
the
grace
which
make
conversation
agreeable
and
improve
,
he
would
,
as
you
do
,
endeavour
to
make
her
fit
company
for
himself
,
as
he
shall
find
she
be
willing
to
improve
,
and
capable
of
improvement
:
that
he
would
direct
her
taste
,
point
out
to
her
proper
subject
for
her
amusement
and
instruction
;
travel
with
her
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
a
month
in
a
year
perhaps
;
and
shew
her
the
world
,
after
he
have
encourage
her
to
put
herself
forward
at
his
own
table
,
and
at
the
house
of
his
friend
,
and
have
see
,
that
she
will
not
do
him
great
discredit
<EOS>
any
where
.
<EOS>
what
obligation
,
and
opportunity
too
,
will
this
give
her
to
love
and
honour
such
a
husband
,
every
hour
,
more
and
more
!
<EOS>
as
she
will
see
his
wisdom
in
a
thousand
instance
,
and
experience
his
indulgence
to
her
in
ten
thousand
,
to
the
praise
of
his
politeness
,
and
the
honour
of
them
both
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
select
party
of
pleasure
or
business
engage
him
not
abroad
,
in
his
home
conversation
,
to
have
him
delight
to
instruct
and
open
her
view
,
and
inspire
her
with
an
ambition
to
enlarge
her
mind
,
and
more
and
more
to
excel
!
<EOS>
what
an
intellectual
kind
of
married
life
would
such
person
find
theirs
!
<EOS>
and
how
suitable
to
the
rule
of
policy
and
self
-
love
in
the
gentleman
;
for
be
not
the
wife
,
and
be
not
her
improvement
,
all
his
own
?
 
<EOS>
absolutely
,
as
I
may
say
,
his
own
?
<EOS>
and
do
not
every
excellence
<EOS>
she
can
be
adorn
by
,
redound
to
her
husband
's
honour
because
she
be
his
,
even
more
than
to
her
own
!
 
<EOS>
in
like
manner
as
no
dishonour
affect
a
man
so
much
,
as
that
which
he
receive
from
a
bad
wife
.
  
<EOS>
but
where
be
such
a
gentleman
as
Mr.
B.
to
be
meet
with
?
<EOS>
look
round
and
see
where
,
with
all
the
advantage
of
sex
,
of
education
,
of
travel
,
of
conversation
in
the
open
world
,
a
gentleman
of
his
ability
to
instruct
and
inform
,
be
to
be
find
?
<EOS>
and
there
be
other
,
who
,
perhaps
,
will
question
the
capacity
or
inclination
of
our
sex
in
general
,
to
improve
in
useful
knowledge
,
<EOS>
be
they
to
meet
with
such
kind
instructor
,
either
in
the
character
of
parent
or
husband
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
first
,
I
grant
,
that
it
be
not
easy
to
find
such
a
gentleman
:
<EOS>
but
for
the
second
(
if
excusable
in
me
,
who
be
one
of
the
sex
,
and
so
may
be
think
partial
to
it
)
<EOS>
,
I
could
by
comparison
draw
from
the
gentleman
and
lady
within
the
circle
of
my
own
acquaintance
,
produce
instance
,
which
be
so
flagrantly
in
their
favour
,
as
may
make
it
suspect
,
that
it
be
policy
more
than
justice
,
in
those
who
would
keep
our
sex
unacquainted
with
that
more
eligible
turn
of
education
,
which
give
the
gentleman
so
many
advantage
over
us
in
that
;
and
which
will
shew
,
they
have
none
at
all
in
nature
or
genius
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
pardon
me
,
dear
Sir
;
for
you
be
so
exalted
above
your
Pamela
,
by
nature
and
education
too
,
that
you
can
not
apprehend
any
inconvenience
from
bold
comparison
.
<EOS>
I
will
beg
,
therefore
,
to
mention
a
few
instance
among
our
friend
,
where
the
lady
,
notwithstanding
their
more
cramped
and
confine
education
,
make
more
than
an
equal
figure
with
the
gentleman
in
all
the
graceful
part
of
conversation
,
in
spite
of
the
contempt
pour
out
upon
our
sex
by
some
witty
gentleman
,
whose
writing
I
have
in
my
eye
.
  
<EOS>
to
begin
then
with
Mr.
Murray
,
and
Miss
Damford
that
be
;
Mr.
Murray
have
the
reputation
of
scholarship
,
and
have
travel
too
;
but
how
infinitely
be
he
surpass
in
every
noble
and
useful
quality
,
and
in
greatness
of
mind
,
and
judgment
,
as
well
as
wit
,
by
the
young
lady
I
have
name
!
<EOS>
this
we
see
,
when
last
at
the
Hall
,
in
fifty
instance
,
where
the
gentleman
be
,
you
know
,
Sir
,
on
a
visit
to
Sir
Simon
and
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
next
,
dear
Sir
,
permit
me
to
observe
,
that
my
good
Lord
Davers
,
with
all
his
advantage
,
bear
a
counsellor
of
the
realm
,
and
educate
accordingly
,
do
not
surpass
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
My
countess
,
as
I
delight
to
call
her
,
and
Lady
Betty
,
her
eld
daughter
,
greatly
surpass
the
Earl
and
her
eld
brother
in
every
point
of
knowledge
,
and
even
learn
,
as
I
may
say
,
although
both
lady
owe
that
advantage
principally
to
their
own
cultivation
and
acquirement
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
presume
,
Sir
,
to
name
Mr.
H.
:
and
when
I
have
name
him
,
shall
we
not
be
puzzle
to
find
any
where
in
our
sex
,
one
remove
from
vulgar
life
,
a
woman
that
will
not
out
-
do
Mr.
H.
?
  
<EOS>
Lady
Darnford
,
upon
all
useful
subject
,
make
a
much
bright
figure
than
Sir
Simon
,
whose
knowledge
of
the
world
have
not
yet
make
him
acquainted
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Arthur
excel
not
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Towers
,
a
maiden
lady
,
be
an
over
-
match
for
half
a
dozen
of
the
neighbouring
gentleman
I
could
name
,
in
what
be
call
wit
and
politeness
,
and
not
inferior
to
any
of
them
in
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
multiply
such
instance
,
be
it
needful
,
to
the
confutation
of
that
low
,
and
I
have
almost
say
,
unmanly
contempt
,
with
which
a
certain
celebrated
genius
treat
our
sex
in
general
in
most
of
his
piece
,
I
have
see
;
particularly
his
Letter
of
Advice
to
a
new
married
Lady
;
<EOS>
so
write
,
as
must
disgust
,
instead
of
instruct
;
and
look
more
like
the
advice
of
an
enemy
to
the
sex
,
and
a
bitter
one
too
,
than
a
friend
to
the
particular
Lady
.
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
beg
pardon
for
this
my
presumption
,
for
two
reason
:
first
,
because
of
the
truly
admirable
talent
of
this
writer
;
and
next
,
because
we
know
not
what
ladie
the
ingenious
gentleman
may
have
fall
among
in
his
young
day
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
therefore
,
I
conclude
,
that
Mr.
B.
be
almost
the
only
gentleman
,
who
excel
every
lady
that
I
have
see
;
so
greatly
excel
,
that
even
the
emanation
of
his
excellence
irradiate
a
low
cottage
-
bear
girl
,
and
make
her
pass
among
lady
of
birth
and
education
for
somebody
.
  
<EOS>
forgive
my
pride
,
dear
Sir
;
but
it
would
be
almost
a
crime
in
your
Pamela
not
to
exult
in
the
mild
benignity
of
those
ray
,
by
which
her
beloved
Mr.
B.
endeavour
to
make
her
look
up
to
his
own
sunny
sphere
:
while
she
,
by
the
advantage
only
of
his
reflect
glory
,
in
his
absence
,
which
make
a
dark
night
to
her
,
glide
along
with
her
paler
and
fainter
beaminess
,
and
make
a
distinguishing
figure
among
such
less
planet
,
as
can
only
poorly
twinkle
and
glimmer
,
for
want
of
the
aid
she
boast
of
.
  
<EOS>
I
dare
not
,
Sir
,
conjecture
whence
arise
this
more
than
parity
in
the
genius
of
the
sex
,
among
the
above
person
,
notwithstanding
the
disparity
of
education
,
and
the
difference
in
the
opportunity
of
each
.
<EOS>
this
may
lead
one
into
too
proud
a
thought
in
favour
of
a
sex
too
contemptuously
treat
by
some
other
wit
I
could
name
,
who
,
indeed
,
be
the
less
to
be
regard
,
as
they
love
to
jest
upon
all
God
Almighty
's
work
:
yet
may
I
better
do
it
,
too
,
than
anybody
,
since
I
be
so
infinitely
transcend
by
my
husband
,
that
no
competition
,
pride
or
vanity
,
could
be
apprehend
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
I
would
only
beg
of
those
who
be
so
free
in
their
contempt
of
us
,
that
they
would
,
for
their
own
sake
(
and
that
,
with
such
generally
go
a
great
way
)
,
rather
try
to
improve
than
depreciate
us
:
<EOS>
we
should
then
make
well
daughter
,
well
wife
,
well
mother
,
and
well
mistress
:
and
who
(
permit
me
,
Sir
,
to
ask
them
)
would
be
so
much
the
well
for
these
opportunity
and
amendment
,
as
our
upbraider
themselves
!
  
<EOS>
on
re
-
peruse
this
,
I
must
repeatedly
beg
your
excuse
for
these
proud
notion
in
behalf
of
my
sex
,
which
,
I
can
truly
say
,
be
not
owe
to
partiality
because
,
I
have
the
honour
to
be
one
of
it
;
but
to
a
far
well
motive
;
for
what
do
this
contemptuous
treatment
of
one
half
,
if
not
the
well
half
,
of
the
human
specie
,
naturally
produce
,
but
libertinism
and
abandon
wickedness
?
<EOS>
for
do
it
not
tend
to
make
the
daughter
,
the
sister
,
the
wife
of
gentleman
,
the
subject
of
profligate
attempt
?
 
<EOS>
do
it
not
render
the
sex
vile
in
the
eye
of
the
most
vile
?
<EOS>
and
when
a
lady
be
no
longer
behold
by
such
person
with
that
dignity
and
reverence
,
with
which
perhaps
,
the
grace
of
her
person
,
and
the
innocence
of
her
mind
,
should
sacredly
,
as
it
be
,
encompass
her
,
do
not
her
very
excellency
become
so
many
incentive
for
base
wretch
to
attempt
her
virtue
,
and
bring
about
her
ruin
?
  
<EOS>
what
then
may
not
wicked
wit
have
to
answer
for
,
when
its
possessor
prostitute
it
to
such
unmanly
purpose
!
<EOS>
and
as
if
they
have
never
have
a
mother
,
a
sister
,
a
daughter
of
their
own
,
throw
down
,
as
much
as
in
them
lie
,
those
sacred
fence
which
may
lay
the
fair
inclosure
open
to
the
invasion
of
every
clumsier
and
viler
beast
of
prey
;
who
,
though
destitute
of
their
wit
,
yet
corrupt
by
it
,
shall
fill
their
mouth
,
as
well
as
their
heart
,
with
the
borrow
mischief
,
and
propagate
it
from
one
to
another
to
the
end
of
time
;
and
who
,
otherwise
,
would
have
pass
by
the
uninvaded
fence
,
and
only
shew
their
tooth
,
and
snarl
at
the
well
secure
fold
within
it
?
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
I
know
be
angry
at
this
romantic
painting
:
since
you
be
not
affect
by
it
:
for
when
at
bad
,
you
act
(
more
dangerously
,
'
tis
true
,
for
the
poor
innocent
)
a
principal
part
,
and
be
as
a
lion
among
beast
 
<EOS>
do
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
let
me
say
among
,
this
one
time
 
You
scorn
to
borrow
any
man
's
wit
;
and
if
nobody
have
follow
your
example
,
till
they
have
have
your
quality
,
the
number
of
rake
would
have
be
but
small
.
<EOS>
yet
,
do
not
mistake
me
,
neither
;
I
be
not
so
mean
as
to
bespeak
your
favour
by
extenuate
your
failing
;
if
I
be
,
you
would
deservedly
despise
me
.
<EOS>
for
,
undoubtedly
(
I
must
say
it
,
Sir
)
,
your
fault
be
the
great
for
your
perfection
:
and
such
talent
misapply
,
as
they
make
you
more
capable
of
mischief
,
so
do
they
increase
the
evil
of
your
practice
.
<EOS>
all
then
that
I
mean
by
say
you
be
not
affect
by
this
painting
,
be
,
that
you
be
not
affect
by
my
description
of
clumsy
and
sordid
rake
,
whose
wit
be
borrow
,
and
their
wickedness
only
what
they
may
call
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
dear
Sir
,
since
that
noble
conversation
you
hold
with
me
at
Tunbridge
,
in
relation
to
the
consequence
that
may
,
have
it
not
be
for
God
's
grace
intervening
,
have
follow
the
masquerade
affair
,
I
have
the
inexpressible
pleasure
to
find
a
thorough
reformation
,
from
the
good
motive
,
take
place
;
and
your
joining
with
me
in
my
closet
(
as
opportunity
permit
)
in
my
evening
duty
,
be
the
charming
confirmation
of
your
kind
and
voluntary
,
and
I
be
proud
to
say
,
pious
assurance
;
so
that
this
make
me
fearless
of
your
displeasure
,
while
I
rather
triumph
in
my
joy
for
your
precious
soul
's
sake
,
than
presume
to
think
of
recriminate
;
and
when
(
only
for
this
once
)
I
take
the
liberty
of
look
back
from
the
delightful
now
,
to
the
painful
formerly
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
what
a
rambler
be
I
again
!
<EOS>
You
command
me
to
write
to
you
all
I
think
,
without
fear
.
<EOS>
I
obey
,
and
,
as
the
phrase
be
,
do
it
without
either
fear
or
wit
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
be
not
displeased
,
it
be
a
mark
of
the
true
nobleness
of
your
nature
,
and
the
sincerity
of
your
late
pious
declaration
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
be
,
I
shall
be
sure
I
have
do
wrong
in
have
apply
a
corrosive
to
eat
away
the
proud
flesh
of
a
wound
,
that
be
not
yet
so
thoroughly
digested
,
as
to
bear
a
painful
application
,
and
require
balsam
and
a
gentle
treatment
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
be
at
Bath
,
I
remember
what
you
say
once
of
the
benefit
of
retrospection
:
and
you
charge
me
,
whenever
a
proper
opportunity
offer
,
to
remind
you
,
by
that
one
word
,
retrospection
,
of
the
charming
conversation
we
have
there
,
on
our
return
from
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
if
this
be
not
one
of
them
,
forgive
,
dear
Sir
,
the
unreasonableness
of
your
very
impertinent
,
but
,
in
intention
and
resolution
,
ever
dutiful
,
  
P.B.
    
<EOS>
from
Mrs.
B.
to
her
Father
and
Mother
  
EVER
DEAR
,
and
EVER
HONOURED
,
  
I
must
write
this
one
letter
,
although
I
have
have
the
happiness
to
see
you
so
lately
;
because
Mr.
B.
be
now
about
to
honour
me
with
the
tour
he
so
kindly
promise
;
and
it
may
therefore
be
several
month
,
perhaps
,
before
I
have
again
the
pleasure
of
pay
you
the
like
dutiful
respect
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
his
kind
promise
,
that
he
would
for
every
dear
baby
<EOS>
I
present
him
with
,
take
an
excursion
with
me
afterwards
,
in
order
to
establish
and
confirm
my
health
.
  
<EOS>
the
task
I
have
undertake
of
dedicate
all
my
writing
amusement
to
the
dear
of
man
;
the
full
employment
I
have
,
when
at
home
;
the
frequent
ramble
he
have
so
often
indulge
me
in
,
with
my
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
to
Kent
,
London
,
Bedfordshire
,
Lincolnshire
,
and
to
my
lady
daver
,
take
from
me
the
necessity
of
write
to
you
,
to
my
Miss
Damford
that
be
,
and
to
Lady
Davers
,
so
often
as
I
formerly
think
myself
oblige
to
do
,
when
I
see
all
my
worthy
friend
so
seldom
;
the
same
thing
,
moreover
,
with
little
variation
,
occur
this
year
,
as
to
our
conversation
,
visit
,
friend
,
employment
,
and
amusement
,
that
fall
out
the
last
,
as
must
be
the
case
in
a
family
so
uniform
and
methodical
as
our
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
for
these
reason
,
more
leisure
to
pursue
my
domestic
duty
,
which
be
increase
upon
me
;
and
when
I
have
say
,
that
I
be
every
day
more
and
more
happy
in
my
beloved
Mr.
B.
,
in
Miss
Goodwin
,
my
Billy
,
my
daver
,
and
now
,
newly
,
in
my
sweet
little
Pamela
(
for
so
,
you
know
,
Lady
Davers
would
have
her
call
,
rather
than
by
her
own
name
)
,
what
can
I
say
more
?
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
tour
I
speak
of
,
you
know
,
the
first
part
of
Mr.
B.
's
obliging
scheme
be
to
carry
me
to
France
;
for
he
have
already
travel
with
me
over
the
great
part
of
England
;
and
I
be
sure
,
by
my
passage
last
year
,
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
be
afraid
of
cross
the
water
from
Dover
thither
;
and
he
will
,
when
we
be
at
Paris
,
he
say
,
take
my
farth
direction
(
that
be
his
kind
expression
)
<EOS>
whither
to
go
next
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
be
so
good
as
to
promise
to
accompany
us
to
Paris
,
provide
Mr.
B.
will
give
them
our
company
to
Aix
-
la
-
Chapelle
,
for
a
month
or
six
week
,
whither
my
lord
be
advise
to
go
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
H.
if
he
can
get
over
his
fear
of
cross
the
salt
water
,
be
to
be
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
G.
,
Miss
Damford
that
be
(
who
likewise
have
lately
lain
-
in
of
a
fine
daughter
)
,
and
I
,
be
to
correspond
as
opportunity
offer
;
and
she
promise
to
send
you
what
I
write
,
as
formerly
:
but
I
have
refuse
to
say
one
word
in
my
letter
of
the
manner
,
custom
,
curiosity
,
&
c.
of
the
place
we
see
;
because
,
first
,
I
shall
not
have
leisure
;
and
,
next
,
those
thing
be
so
much
better
describe
in
book
write
by
person
who
make
strict
and
well
observation
that
I
can
pretend
to
make
:
so
that
what
I
shall
write
will
relate
only
to
our
private
self
,
and
be
as
brief
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
do
as
Mr.
B.
have
it
in
his
thought
,
he
intend
to
be
out
of
England
two
year
:
 
<EOS>
but
how
can
I
bear
that
,
if
for
your
sake
only
,
and
for
those
of
my
dear
baby
!
 
<EOS>
but
this
must
be
my
time
,
my
only
time
,
Mr.
B.
say
,
to
ramble
and
see
distant
place
and
country
;
for
as
soon
as
his
little
one
be
capable
of
my
instruction
,
and
begin
to
understand
my
look
and
sign
,
he
will
not
spare
me
from
them
a
week
together
;
and
he
be
so
kind
as
to
propose
,
that
my
dear
bold
boy
(
for
every
one
see
how
greatly
he
resemble
his
papa
in
his
dear
forward
spirit
)
<EOS>
shall
go
with
us
;
and
this
please
Miss
Goodwin
highly
,
who
be
very
fond
of
him
,
and
my
little
daver
;
but
vow
she
will
never
love
so
well
my
pretty
black
-
eyed
Pamela
.
  
<EOS>
You
see
what
a
sweet
girl
Miss
be
,
and
you
admire
her
much
:
do
I
tell
you
,
what
she
say
to
me
,
when
first
she
see
you
both
,
with
your
silver
hair
,
and
reverend
countenance
?
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
I
dare
say
,
your
papa
,
and
mamma
,
honour
their
father
and
mother
:
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
do
,
my
dear
;
but
what
be
your
reason
for
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
they
have
live
so
long
in
the
land
which
the
LORD
their
GOD
have
give
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
take
the
charmer
in
my
arm
,
and
kiss
her
three
or
four
time
,
as
she
deserve
;
for
be
not
this
very
pretty
in
the
child
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
,
with
inexpressible
pleasure
,
write
you
word
how
happily
God
's
providence
have
now
,
at
last
,
turn
that
affair
,
which
once
make
me
so
uneasy
,
in
relation
to
the
fine
Countess
(
who
have
be
some
time
abroad
)
,
of
whom
you
have
hear
,
as
you
tell
me
,
some
report
,
which
,
have
you
know
at
the
time
,
would
have
make
you
very
apprehensive
for
Mr.
B.
's
moral
,
as
well
as
for
my
repose
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
now
(
because
I
can
do
it
with
the
high
pleasure
,
by
reason
of
the
event
it
have
produce
)
,
explain
that
dark
affair
so
far
as
shall
make
you
judge
of
my
present
joy
:
although
I
have
hitherto
avoid
enter
into
that
subject
to
you
.
<EOS>
for
now
I
think
myself
,
by
God
's
grace
,
secure
to
the
affection
and
fidelity
of
the
good
of
husband
,
and
that
from
the
worthy
motive
;
as
you
shall
hear
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
thing
want
to
complete
all
the
happiness
I
wish
for
in
this
life
;
which
be
,
the
remote
hope
I
have
entertain
,
that
one
day
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
who
from
a
licentious
gentleman
become
a
moralist
,
would
be
so
touch
by
the
divine
grace
,
as
to
become
in
time
,
more
than
moral
,
a
religious
man
,
and
,
at
last
,
join
in
the
duty
which
he
have
the
goodness
to
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
reason
I
begin
with
mere
indispensable
.
<EOS>
I
crowd
not
his
gate
with
object
of
charity
:
I
visit
them
at
their
home
,
and
relieve
them
;
distinguish
the
worthy
indigent
(
make
so
by
unavoidable
accident
and
casualty
)
from
the
wilfully
,
or
perversely
,
or
sottishly
such
,
by
great
mark
of
my
favour
.
  
<EOS>
I
confine
my
morning
and
evening
devotion
to
my
own
private
closet
,
lest
I
should
give
offence
and
discouragement
to
so
gay
a
temper
,
so
unaccustomed
(
poor
gentleman
!
)
<EOS>
to
act
of
devotion
and
piety
<EOS>
;
whilst
I
meet
his
household
together
,
only
on
morning
and
evening
of
the
Sabbath
-
day
,
to
prepare
them
for
their
public
duty
in
the
one
,
and
in
hope
to
confirm
them
in
what
they
have
hear
at
church
in
the
other
;
leave
them
to
their
own
reflection
for
the
rest
of
the
week
;
after
I
have
suggest
a
method
I
wish
them
to
follow
,
and
in
which
they
constantly
oblige
me
.
  
<EOS>
this
good
order
have
its
desire
effect
,
and
our
Sabbath
-
day
assembly
be
hold
with
so
little
parade
,
that
we
be
hardly
any
of
us
miss
.
<EOS>
all
,
in
short
,
be
do
with
cheerful
ease
and
composure
:
and
every
one
of
us
be
better
disposed
to
our
domestic
duty
:
I
,
to
attend
the
good
pleasure
of
my
good
friend
;
and
they
,
that
of
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
thus
we
go
on
very
happily
,
my
neighbourly
visit
of
charity
,
take
up
no
more
time
than
common
airing
,
and
pass
many
of
them
for
such
;
my
private
duty
be
only
between
my
first
,
my
HEAVENLY
BENEFACTOR
,
and
myself
,
and
my
family
one
personally
confine
to
the
day
separate
for
these
good
of
service
,
and
Mr.
B.
please
with
my
manner
behold
the
good
effect
,
and
countenance
me
by
his
praise
and
his
endearment
,
as
act
discreetly
,
as
not
fall
into
enthusiasm
,
and
(
as
he
use
to
say
)
as
not
aim
at
be
righteous
overmuch
.
  
<EOS>
but
still
I
want
,
and
wait
for
,
with
humble
patience
,
and
make
it
part
of
my
constant
prayer
,
that
the
divine
Grace
would
at
last
touch
his
heart
,
and
make
him
more
than
a
countenancer
,
more
than
an
applauder
of
my
duty
;
that
he
may
for
his
own
dear
sake
,
become
a
partaker
in
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
think
I
,
"
when
we
can
,
hand
in
hand
,
heart
in
heart
,
one
spirit
as
well
as
one
flesh
,
join
in
the
same
closet
,
in
the
same
prayer
and
thanksgiving
,
what
a
happy
creature
shall
I
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
closet
:
<EOS>
for
I
durst
not
aspire
so
high
,
as
to
hope
the
favour
of
his
company
among
his
servant
,
in
our
Sunday
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
would
be
go
too
far
,
in
his
opinion
,
to
expect
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
in
me
their
mistress
,
have
I
be
ever
so
high
-
bear
,
it
be
not
amiss
,
because
I
,
and
they
,
every
one
of
us
,
be
his
;
<EOS>
I
in
one
degree
,
Mr.
Longman
in
another
,
Mrs.
Jervis
in
another
 
<EOS>
but
from
a
man
of
his
high
temper
and
manner
of
education
,
I
know
I
could
never
hope
for
it
,
so
would
not
lose
every
thing
,
by
grasp
at
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
the
midst
of
all
these
comfortable
proceeding
,
and
my
further
charming
hope
,
a
nasty
masquerade
throw
into
his
way
a
temptation
,
which
for
a
time
blast
all
my
prospect
,
and
indeed
make
me
doubt
my
own
head
almost
.
<EOS>
for
,
judge
my
disappointment
,
when
I
find
all
my
wish
frustrate
,
all
my
prayer
render
ineffectual
;
his
very
morality
,
which
I
have
flatter
myself
,
in
time
,
I
should
be
an
humble
instrument
to
exalt
into
religion
,
shock
,
and
in
danger
;
and
all
the
work
to
begin
over
again
,
if
offend
Grace
should
ever
again
offer
itself
to
the
dear
wilful
trespasser
!
  
<EOS>
but
who
should
pretend
to
scrutinize
the
council
of
the
Almighty
?
 
<EOS>
for
out
of
all
this
evil
appearance
be
to
proceed
the
real
good
<EOS>
,
I
have
be
so
long
,
and
so
often
,
supplicate
for
!
  
<EOS>
the
dear
man
be
to
be
on
the
brink
of
relapse
<EOS>
:
it
be
proper
,
that
I
should
be
so
very
uneasy
,
as
to
assume
a
conduct
not
natural
to
my
temper
,
and
to
raise
his
generous
concern
for
me
:
and
,
in
the
very
crisis
,
divine
Grace
interpose
,
make
him
sensible
of
his
danger
,
make
him
resolve
against
his
error
,
before
it
be
yet
too
late
:
and
<EOS>
his
slide
foot
,
quit
the
slippery
path
he
be
in
,
collect
new
strength
,
and
he
stand
the
firm
and
more
secure
for
his
peril
.
  
<EOS>
for
have
happily
put
a
stop
to
that
affair
,
and
by
his
uniform
conduct
,
for
a
considerable
time
,
shew
me
that
I
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
it
,
he
be
pleased
,
when
we
be
last
at
Tunbridge
,
and
in
very
serious
discourse
upon
divine
subject
,
to
say
to
this
effect
:
"
be
there
not
,
my
Pamela
,
a
text
,
that
the
unbelieving
husband
shall
be
save
by
the
believe
wife
,
whilst
he
behold
her
chaste
conversation
couple
with
fear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
tell
you
,
my
dear
Mr.
B.
,
that
there
be
,
nor
where
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
my
dear
,
I
begin
to
hope
,
that
will
be
my
case
;
<EOS>
for
,
from
a
former
affair
,
of
which
this
spot
of
ground
put
me
more
in
mind
,
I
see
so
much
reason
to
doubt
my
own
strength
,
which
I
have
build
,
and
,
as
I
think
securely
,
on
moral
foundation
,
that
I
must
look
out
for
a
well
guide
to
conduct
me
,
than
the
proud
word
honour
can
be
,
in
the
general
acceptance
of
it
among
us
lively
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
often
have
I
promise
<EOS>
(
and
I
never
promise
but
I
intend
to
perform
)
<EOS>
that
I
would
be
faithfully
and
only
yours
!
<EOS>
how
often
declare
,
that
I
do
not
think
I
could
possibly
deserve
my
Pamela
,
till
I
could
shew
her
,
in
my
own
mind
,
a
purity
as
nearly
equal
to
hers
,
as
my
past
conduct
would
admit
of
!
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
depend
too
much
upon
my
own
strength
:
and
I
be
now
convinced
,
that
nothing
but
religious
CONSIDERATIONS
,
and
a
resolution
to
watch
over
the
very
first
appearance
of
evil
,
and
to
check
them
as
they
arise
,
can
be
of
sufficient
weight
to
keep
steady
to
his
good
purpose
,
a
vain
young
man
,
too
little
accustomed
to
restraint
,
and
too
much
use
to
play
upon
the
brink
of
danger
,
from
a
temerity
,
and
love
of
intrigue
,
natural
to
enterprise
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
make
this
declaration
of
my
conviction
to
you
,
till
I
have
thoroughly
examine
myself
,
and
have
reason
to
hope
,
that
I
should
be
enable
to
make
it
good
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
Pamela
,
from
this
instant
you
shall
be
my
guide
;
and
,
only
take
care
,
that
you
do
not
,
all
at
once
,
by
injunction
too
rigorous
,
damp
and
discourage
the
rise
flame
,
I
will
leave
it
to
you
to
direct
as
you
please
,
till
,
by
degree
<EOS>
,
it
may
be
deem
worthy
to
mingle
with
your
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
judge
<EOS>
how
rapturous
my
joy
be
upon
this
occasion
,
and
how
ready
I
be
to
bless
God
for
a
danger
(
so
narrowly
escape
)
which
be
attend
with
the
very
consequence
that
I
have
so
long
pray
for
;
and
which
I
little
think
the
divine
providence
be
bring
about
by
the
very
mean
,
that
,
I
apprehend
,
would
put
an
end
to
all
my
pleasing
hope
and
prospect
of
that
nature
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
me
to
seek
word
to
express
what
I
feel
,
and
how
I
act
,
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
hear
him
out
with
twenty
different
and
impatient
emotion
;
and
then
throw
myself
at
his
foot
,
embrace
his
knee
,
with
arm
the
most
ardently
clasp
!
<EOS>
My
face
lift
up
to
Heaven
,
and
to
him
,
by
turn
;
my
eye
overflow
with
tear
of
joy
,
which
half
choke
up
the
passage
of
my
word
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
his
kind
arm
clasp
my
neck
,
and
kiss
my
tearful

I
could
only
say
 
"
My
ardent
prayer
,
be
at
last
-
hear
 
<EOS>
May
God
Almighty
confirm
your
pious
purpose
!
<EOS>
and
,
oh
I
<EOS>
what
a
happy
Pamela
have
you
at
your
foot
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
weep
for
joy
till
I
sob
again
 
<EOS>
and
he
raise
me
to
his
kind
arm
<EOS>
,
I
say
 
"
to
have
this
heavenly
prospect
,
o
best
beloved
of
my
heart
!
<EOS>
add
to
all
my
earthly
blessing
!
 
<EOS>
how
shall
I
contain
my
joy
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
oh
!
to
think
that
he
be
,
and
will
be
mine
,
and
I
his
,
through
the
mercy
of
God
,
when
this
transitory
life
be
past
and
go
,
to
all
eternity
;
what
a
rich
thought
be
this
!
 
<EOS>
Methinks
I
be
already
,
dear
Sir
,
cease
to
be
mortal
,
and
begin
to
taste
the
perfection
of
those
joy
,
which
this
thrice
welcome
declaration
give
me
hope
of
hereafter
!
 
<EOS>
but
what
shall
I
say
,
oblige
as
I
be
beyond
expression
before
,
and
now
doubly
oblige
in
the
rapturous
view
you
have
open
to
me
,
into
a
happy
futurity
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
be
delighted
with
me
beyond
expression
;
that
I
be
his
ecstatic
charmer
!
 
<EOS>
that
the
love
I
shew
for
his
future
good
be
the
move
proof
of
the
purity
of
my
heart
,
and
my
affection
for
him
.
<EOS>
and
that
very
evening
he
join
with
me
in
my
retire
duty
;
and
,
at
all
proper
opportunity
,
favour
me
with
his
company
in
the
same
manner
;
listen
attentively
to
all
my
lesson
,
as
he
call
my
cheerful
discourse
on
serious
subject
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
parent
,
do
you
not
rejoice
with
me
in
this
charming
,
charming
appearance
?
<EOS>
for
,
before
I
have
the
most
generous
,
the
most
beneficent
,
the
most
noble
,
the
most
affectionate
,
but
now
I
be
likely
to
have
the
most
pious
,
of
husband
!
<EOS>
what
a
happy
wife
,
what
a
happy
daughter
,
be
his
and
your
Pamela
!
<EOS>
God
of
his
infinite
mercy
,
continue
and
improve
the
ravish
prospect
!
  
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
leave
off
here
,
to
enjoy
the
charming
reflection
,
which
this
lovely
subject
,
and
my
blessed
prospect
,
fill
me
with
;
and
now
proceed
to
write
a
few
line
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
under
some
concern
on
account
of
our
go
to
travel
into
some
roman
catholic
country
,
for
fear
we
should
want
the
public
opportunity
of
divine
service
:
for
I
presume
,
the
ambassador
's
chapel
will
be
the
only
protestant
place
of
worship
allow
of
,
and
Paris
the
only
city
in
France
where
there
be
one
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
endeavour
to
make
it
up
in
our
private
and
domestic
duty
:
<EOS>
for
,
as
the
phrase
be
 
<EOS>
"
when
we
be
at
Rome
,
we
must
do
as
they
do
at
Rome
;
"
that
be
to
say
,
so
far
as
not
to
give
offence
,
on
the
one
hand
,
to
the
people
we
be
among
;
nor
scandal
,
on
the
other
,
by
compliance
hurtful
to
one
's
conscience
.
<EOS>
but
my
protector
know
all
these
thing
so
well
<EOS>
(
no
place
in
what
be
call
the
grand
tour
,
be
new
to
him
)
,
<EOS>
that
I
have
no
reason
to
be
very
uneasy
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
let
me
,
by
letter
,
as
I
do
on
my
knee
at
parting
,
beg
the
continuance
of
your
prayer
and
blessing
,
and
that
God
will
preserve
us
to
one
another
,
and
give
us
,
and
all
our
worthy
friend
,
a
happy
meeting
again
.
  
<EOS>
Kent
,
you
may
be
sure
,
will
be
our
first
visit
,
on
our
return
,
for
your
sake
,
for
my
dear
daver
's
,
and
<EOS>
my
little
Pamela
's
sake
,
who
will
be
both
put
into
your
protection
;
while
my
Billy
,
and
Miss
Goodwin
(
for
,
since
I
begin
this
letter
<EOS>
,
it
be
so
determined
)
,
be
to
be
my
delightful
companion
;
for
Mr.
B.
declare
,
his
temper
want
look
after
,
and
his
notice
of
every
thing
be
strong
and
significant
.
  
<EOS>
poor
little
dear
!
<EOS>
he
have
indeed
a
little
sort
of
perverseness
and
headstrongness
,
as
one
may
say
,
in
his
will
:
yet
he
be
but
a
baby
,
and
I
hope
to
manage
him
pretty
well
;
for
he
notice
all
I
say
,
and
every
look
of
mine
already
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
besides
,
very
good
humoured
,
and
willing
to
part
with
anything
for
a
kind
word
:
and
this
give
me
hope
of
a
docile
and
benevolent
disposition
,
as
he
grow
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
when
I
begin
the
last
paragraph
but
one
,
that
I
be
within
a
line
of
conclude
;
but
it
be
to
you
,
and
of
my
baby
,
I
be
write
;
so
shall
go
on
to
the
bottom
of
this
new
sheet
,
if
I
do
not
directly
finish
:
which
I
do
,
with
assure
you
both
,
that
wherever
I
be
,
I
shall
always
be
thoughtful
of
you
,
and
remember
you
in
my
prayer
,
as
become
your
ever
dutiful
daughter
,
<EOS>
P.B.
  
My
respect
to
all
your
good
neighbour
in
general

<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
will
visit
you
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jervis
will
take
one
journey
into
Kent

say
,
and
it
shall
be
to
accompany
my

when
carry
down
to
you

<EOS>
poor

My

<EOS>
I
receive
your
last
letter
at
Paris
,
as
we
be
dispose
every
thing
for
our
return
to
England
,
after
an
absence
of
near
two
year
;
in
which
,
as
I
have
inform
you
,
from
time
to
time
,
I
have
be
a
great
traveller
,
into
Holland
,
the
Netherlands
,
through
the
most
considerable
province
of
France
,
into
Italy
;
and
,
in
our
return
to
Paris
again
(
the
principal
place
of
our
residence
)
,
through
several
part
of
Germany
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
you
of
the
favour
and
civility
we
receive
at
Florence
,
from
the
then
Countess
Dowager
of
 
,
who
,
with
her
humble
servant
Lord
C
#

(
that
have
so
assiduously
attend
her
for
so
many
month
in
Italy
)
,
accompany
us
from
Florence
to
Inspruck
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
make
that
worthy
lord
happy
in
about
a
month
after
she
part
from
us
,
and
the
noble
pair
give
us
an
opportunity
at
Paris
,
in
their
way
to
England
,
to
return
some
of
the
civility
which
we
receive
from
them
in
Italy
;
and
they
be
now
arrive
at
her
ladyship
's
seat
on
the
Forest
.
  
<EOS>
Her
lord
be
exceedingly
fond
of
her
,
as
he
well
may
;
for
she
be
one
of
the
most
charming
lady
in
England
;
and
behave
to
him
with
so
much
prudence
and
respect
,
that
they
be
as
happy
in
each
other
as
can
be
wish
.
<EOS>
and
let
me
just
add
,
that
both
in
Italy
and
at
Paris
,
Mr.
B.
's
demeanour
and
her
ladyship
be
to
one
another
,
be
so
nobly
open
,
and
unaffectedly
polite
,
as
well
as
highly
discreet
,
that
neither
Lord
C.
who
have
once
be
jealous
of
Mr.
B.
nor
the
other
party
,
who
have
have
a
tincture
of
the
same
yellow
evil
,
as
you
know
,
because
of
the
Countess
,
have
so
much
as
a
shadow
of
uneasiness
remain
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Davers
have
have
his
health
(
which
have
begin
to
decline
in
England
)
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
there
be
no
persuade
Lady
Davers
to
return
before
now
,
although
I
beg
and
pray
I
may
not
have
another
little
Frenchman
,
for
fear
they
should
,
as
they
grow
up
,
forget
,
as
I
pleasantly
use
to
say
,
the
obligation
which
their
parentage
lay
them
under
to
dearer
England
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
have
shut
up
my
ramble
for
my
whole
life
;
for
three
little
english
folk
,
and
one
little
Frenchman
(
but
a
charming
baby
as
well
as
the
rest
,
Charley
by
name
)
,
and
a
near
prospect
of
a
further
increase
,
you
will
say
,
be
family
enough
to
employ
all
my
care
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
,
from
time
to
time
,
although
I
could
not
write
to
you
so
often
as
I
would
,
because
of
our
be
constantly
in
motion
,
what
be
most
worthy
of
your
knowledge
relate
to
every
particular
,
and
how
happy
we
all
have
be
in
one
another
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
pleasure
to
confirm
to
you
what
I
have
often
write
,
that
Mr.
B.
and
my
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
be
all
that
I
could
wish
and
hope
for
,
with
regard
to
their
first
duty
.
<EOS>
We
be
indeed
a
happy
family
,
unite
by
the
good
and
most
solid
tie
!
  
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
be
a
charming
young
lady
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
how
much
I
love
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
perfect
mistress
of
the
french
language
and
speak
italian
very
prettily
!
<EOS>
and
,
as
to
myself
,
I
have
improve
so
well
under
my
dear
tutor
's
lesson
,
together
with
the
opportunity
of
converse
with
the
politest
and
most
learn
gentry
of
different
nation
,
that
I
will
discourse
with
you
in
two
or
three
language
,
if
you
please
,
when
I
have
the
happiness
to
see
you

<EOS>
there
be
a
learned
boaster
for
you
,
my
dear
friend
!
<EOS>
(
if
the
knowledge
of
different
language
make
one
learn
.
)
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
bring
you
an
heart
as
entirely
English
as
ever
,
for
all
that
!
  
<EOS>
We
land
on
Thursday
last
at
Dover
,
and
direct
our
course
to
the
dear
farm
-
house
;
and
you
can
better
imagine
,
than
I
express
,
our
meeting
with
my
dear
father
and
mother
,
and
my
beloved
Davers
and
Pamela
,
who
be
charming
baby
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
not
this
the
language
of
every
fond
mamma
?
  
<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin
be
highly
delighted
now
with
my
sweet
little
Pamela
,
and
say
,
she
shall
be
her
sister
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
for
,
Madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
Miss
be
a
beauty
!
 
<EOS>
and
we
see
no
french
beauty
like
Master
Davers
and
Mississippi
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beauty
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
say
I
;
"
what
be
beauty
,
if
she
be
not
a
good
girl
?
<EOS>
beauty
be
but
a
specious
,
and
,
<EOS>
as
it
may
happen
,
a
dangerous
recommendation
,
a
mere
skin
-
deep
perfection
;
and
if
,
as
she
grow
up
,
she
be
not
as
good
as
Miss
Goodwin
,
she
shall
be
none
of
my
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
add
to
my
pleasure
,
my
dear
friend
,
be
to
see
them
both
so
well
get
over
the
small
-
pox
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
as
happy
for
them
,
as
it
be
for
their
mamma
and
her
Billy
,
that
they
have
it
under
so
skilful
and
kind
a
manager
in
that
distemper
,
as
my
dear
mother
.
<EOS>
I
wish
if
it
please
God
,
it
be
as
happily
over
with
my
little
pretty
Frenchman
.
  
<EOS>
every
body
be
surprised
to
see
what
the
past
two
year
have
do
for
Miss
Goodwin
and
my
Billy
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
my
dear
friend
,
they
be
both
of
them
almost
 
nay
,
quite
,
I
think
,
for
their
year
,
all
that
I
wish
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
make
them
keep
their
French
,
which
Miss
so
well
speak
,
and
<EOS>
Billy
so
prettily
prattle
,
I
oblige
them
,
when
they
be
in
the
nursery
,
to
speak
nothing
else
:
but
at
table
,
except
on
particular
occasion
,
when
French
may
be
speak
,
they
be
to
speak
in
English
;
that
is
,
when
they
do
speak
:
for
I
tell
them
,
that
little
master
must
only
ask
question
for
information
,
and
say
 
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
or
 
"
no
,
"
till
their
papa
or
mamma
permit
them
to
speak
;
nor
little
lady
<EOS>
neither
,
till
they
be
sixteen
;
for
 
"
My
dear
love
,
"
cry
I
,
"
you
would
not
speak
before
you
know
how
;
and
knowledge
be
obtain
by
hearing
,
and
not
by
speak
.
"
<EOS>
and
set
my
Billy
on
my
lap
,
in
Miss
's
presence
 
"
here
,
"
say
I
,
take
an
ear
in
the
finger
of
each
hand
,
"
be
two
ear
,
my
Billy
,
"
and
then
,
point
to
his
mouth
,
"
but
one
tongue
,
my
love
;
<EOS>
so
you
must
be
sure
to
mind
that
you
hear
twice
as
much
as
you
speak
,
even
when
you
grow
a
big
master
than
you
be
now
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
so
many
pretty
way
to

Madam

say
Miss

now
<EOS>
and
then
,

that
it

my

to
compliment
me
,
that
the
child
will
not
suffer
for
want
of
a
tutor
,
while
I
can
take
the
pain
I
do
:
which
he
will
have
to
be

much
for
me

all
our

here
admire
us
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
my
seeming
(
for
it
be
but
seem
)
<EOS>
vanity
<EOS>
:
I
hope
I
know
better
than
to
have
it
real
 
<EOS>
"
never
,
"
say
Mrs.
Towers
,
who
be
still
a
single
lady
,
"
do
I
see
,
before
,
a
lady
so
much
advantage
by
her
residence
in
that
fantastic
nation
"
(
for
she
love
not
the
French
)
"
who
bring
home
with
her
nothing
of
their
affectation
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
that
the
french
politeness
,
and
the
english
frankness
and
plainness
of
heart
,
appear
happily
blend
in
all
we
say
and
do
.
<EOS>
and
she
make
me
a
thousand
compliment
upon
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
's
account
,
<EOS>
who
,
she
would
fain
persuade
me
,
owe
a
great
deal
of
improvement
(
my
lord
in
his
conversation
,
and
my
lady
in
her
temper
)
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lady
Davers
be
exceed
kind
and
good
to
me
,
be
always
magnify
me
to
every
body
,
and
say
she
know
not
how
to
live
from
me
:
and
that
I
have
be
a
means
of
save
half
a
hundred
soul
,
as
well
as
her
dear
brother
's
.
<EOS>
on
an
indisposition
of
my
Lord
's
at
Montpellier
,
which
make
her
very
apprehensive
,
she
declare
,
that
be
she
to
be
deprive
of
his
lordship
,
she
would
not
let
us
rest
till
we
have
consent
to
her
live
with
us
;
say
that
we
have
room
enough
in
Lincolnshire
,
and
she
would
enlarge
the
Bedfordshire
seat
at
her
own
expense
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
H.
be
Mr.
H.
still
;
and
that
be
the
good
I
can
say
of
him
;
for
I
verily
think
,
he
be
more
of
an
ape
than
ever
.
<EOS>
His
whole
head
be
now
french
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
half
so
before
.
<EOS>
We
have
great
difficulty
with
him
abroad
:
his
aunt
and
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
give
him
a
serious
and
religious
turn
,
we
have
like
to
have
turn
him
into
a
roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
for
he
be
much
pleased
with
the
shewy
part
of
that
religion
,
and
the
fine
picture
,
and
decoration
in
the
church
of
Italy
;
and
have
get
into
company
with
a
Dominican
at
Padua
,
a
Franciscan
at
Milan
,
and
a
Jesuit
at
Paris
,
they
lie
so
hard
at
him
,
in
their
turn
,
that
we
have
like
to
have
lose
him
to
each
assailant
:
so
be
force
to
let
him
take
his
own
course
;
for
,
his
aunt
would
have
it
,
that
he
have
no
other
defence
from
the
attack
of
person
to
make
him
embrace
a
faulty
religion
,
than
to
permit
him
to
continue
as
he
be
;
that
be
to
say
,
to
have
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
so
she
suspend
attempt
to
proselyte
the
thoughtless
creature
,
till
he
come
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
wish
her
success
here
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
doubt
,
he
will
not
be
a
credit
to
any
religion
,
for
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
be
very
desirous
to
go
to
London
,
it
will
be
find
,
when
there
,
that
any
flutter
coxcomb
will
do
more
to
make
him
one
of
that
class
,
in
an
hour
,
than
his
aunt
's
lesson
,
to
make
him
a
good
man
,
in
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
"
where
much
be
give
,
much
be
require
.
<EOS>
"
the
contrary
of
this
,
I
doubt
,
be
all
poor
Mr.
H.
have
to
trust
to
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
just
now
hear
that
his
father
,
who
have
be
long
ill
,
be
dead
.
<EOS>
so
now
,
he
be
a
lord
indeed
!
<EOS>
He
flutter
and
start
about
most
strangely
,
I
warrant
,
and
be
wholly
employ
in
give
direction
as
to
his
mourning
equipage
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
there
will
be
no
hold
him
in
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
;
except
his
new
title
have
so
much
virtue
in
it
,
as
to
make
him
a
wise
and
well
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
will
now
have
a
seat
in
the
House
of
Peers
of
Great
Britain
;
but
I
hope
,
for
the
nation
's
sake
,
he
will
not
find
many
more
like
himself
there
!
 
<EOS>
for
,
to
me
,
that
be
one
of
the
most
venerable
assembly
in
the
world
;
and
it
appear
the
more
so
,
since
I
have
be
abroad
;
for
an
english
gentleman
be
respect
,
if
he
be
any
thing
of
a
man
,
above
a
foreign
nobleman
;
and
an
english
nobleman
above
some
petty
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
if
our
travel
gentry
duly
consider
this
distinction
in
their
favour
,
they
would
,
for
the
honour
of
their
country
,
as
well
as
for
their
own
credit
,
behave
in
a
well
manner
,
in
their
foreign
tour
,
than
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
some
of
them
do
.
<EOS>
but
what
can
one
expect
from
the
unlicked
cubs
(
pardon
the
term
)
send
abroad
with
only
stature
,
to
make
them
look
like
man
,
and
equipage
to
attract
respect
,
without
one
other
qualification
to
enforce
it
?
  
<EOS>
here
let
me
close
this
,
with
a
few
tear
,
to
the
memory
of
my
dear
Mrs.
Jervis
,
my
other
mother
,
my
friend
,
my
adviser
,
my
protectress
,
in
my
single
state
;
and
my
faithful
second
and
partak
in
the
comfort
of
my
high
life
,
and
well
fortune
!
  
<EOS>
what
would
I
have
give
to
have
be
present
,
as
it
seem
,
she
so
earnestly
wish
,
to
close
her
die
eye
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
do
it
with
the
piety
and
the
concern
of
a
truly
affectionate
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
that
melancholy
happiness
be
deny
to
us
both
;
for
,
as
I
tell
you
in
the
letter
on
the
occasion
,
the
dear
good
woman
(
who
be
now
in
the
possession
of
her
blessed
reward
,
and
rejoice
in
God
's
mercy
)
be
no
more
,
when
the
news
reach
me
,
so
far
off
as
Heidelburgh
,
of
her
last
illness
and
wish
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
forbear
,
every
time
I
enter
her
parlour
(
where
I
use
to
see
,
with
so
much
delight
,
the
good
woman
sit
,
always
employ
in
some
useful
or
pious
work
)
,
shed
a
tear
to
her
memory
;
and
in
my
Sabbath
duty
,
miss
her
,
I
miss
half
a
dozen
friend

;
and
I
sigh
in
remembrance
of
her
;
and
can
only
recover
that
cheerful
frame
,
which
the
performance
of
those
duty
always
give
me

by
reflect

that
she
be
now

the
reward
of
that
sincere
piety
,
which
use
to
edify
and
encourage
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
we
bring
home
,
and
those
we
leave
behind
,
melt
in
tear
at
the
name
of
Mrs.
Jervis
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Longman
,
too
,
lament
the
loss
of
her
,
in
the
most
moving
strain
.
<EOS>
and
all
I
can
do
now
,
in
honour
of
her
memory
and
her
merit
,
be
to
be
a
friend
to
those
she
love
most
,
as
I
have
already
begin
to
be
,
and
none
of
them
shall
suffer
in
those
concern
that
can
be

poor

too

(
'
tis
almost
a
misery
to
have
<EOS>
so
soft
,
so
susceptible
an
heart
as
I
have
,
or
to
have
such
good
servant

one
can
not
lose
without
such
emotion

I
feel
for
the
loss

which
I
have
behold
with
so
much
delight
,
and
think
I
have

I
see
them
adorn
so
honest

be

<EOS>
forgive
me
,
he
be
not
a
common
servant
;
neither
be
any
of
ours
<EOS>
so
:
<EOS>
but
Jonathan
excel
all
that
excel
in
his
class!-I
be
tell
,
that
these
two
worthy
folk
die
within
two
day
of
one
another
:
on
which
occasion
I
could
not
help
say
to
myself
,
in
the
word
of
David
over
Saul
and
his
son
Jonathan
,
the
name
-
sake
of
our
worthy
butler
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
lovely
and
pleasant
in
their
life
,
and
in
their
death
they
be
not
divide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
continue
on
in
the
word
of
the
royal
lamenter
;
for
,
surely
,
never
do
one
fellow
-
servant
love
another
in
my
maiden
state
,
nor
servant
love
a
mistress
in
my
exalt
condition
,
well
than
Jonathan
love
me
!
<EOS>
I
could
see
in
his
eye
a
glisten
pleasure
,
whenever
I
pass
by
him
:
if
at
such
time
I
speak
to
him
,
as
I
seldom
fail
to
do
,
with
a
 
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
too
!
"
<EOS>
in
answer
to
his
repeat
blessing
,
he
have
a
kind
of
rejuvenescence
(
may
I
say
?
)
<EOS>
visibly
run
through
his
whole
frame
:
and
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
I
lay
my
hand
upon
his
fold
one
,
as
I
pass
him
on
a
Sunday
morning
or
evening
,
pray
for
me
,
with
a
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
,
my
worthy
old
acquaintance
?
"
his
heart
would
spring
to
his
lip
in
a
kind
of
rapture
,
and
his
eye
would
run
over
.
  
<EOS>
o
my

<EOS>
how
the
loss
of
these
two
worthy
of

oppress
me
at

as
I
always
do

my

do

from

<EOS>
I
will
not
take
up
your

with
further
observation
upon
this
poor

's
bad
conduct

his
reflection
must
proceed
from
feel
;
and
will
,
that
be
the
bad
of
it
,
come
too
late
,
come
when
or
how
it

<EOS>
I
will
only
say
,
I
be
sorry
for
it
on
his
own
account
,
but
more
for
that
of
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
who
take
the
matter
very
heavily
,
and
wish
he
have
marry
the
lowest
bear
creature
in
England
<EOS>
(
so
she
have
be
honest
and
virtuous
)
,
rather
than
do
as
he
have
do

<EOS>
but
,
I
suppose
,
the
poor

be
resolve
to
shun
,
at
all
adventure
,
Mr.
B.

fault
,
and
keep
up
to
the
pride
of
descent

and
so
marry
the
only
creature
,
as
I
hope
(
since
it
can
not
be
help
)
,
that
be
so
great
a
disgrace
to
both
:
for
I
presume
to
flatter
myself
,
for
the
sake
of
my
sex
,
that
,
among
the
poor
wretch
who
be
sink
so
low
as
the
town
-
woman
be
,
there
be
very
few
of
birth
or
education
;
but
such
,
principally
,
as
have
have
their
necessity
or
their
ignorance
take
advantage
of
by
base
man
;
since
birth
and
education
must
needs
set
the
most
unhappy
of
the
sex
above
<EOS>
so
sordid
and
so
abandon
a
guilt
,
<EOS>
as
the
hourly
wickedness
of
such
a
course
of
life
subject
them
to
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
me
pursue
my
purpose
of
excuse
my
long
silence
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
return
from
Lady
Davers
's
,
and
recover
my
family
management
,
and
resume
my
nursery
duty
,
when
my
fourth
dear
boy
,
my
Jemmy
(
for
,
I
think
be
I
go
on
to
make
out
the
number
Lady
Davers
allot
me
)
,
press
so
upon
me
,
as
not
to
be
refuse
,
for
one
month
or
six
week
close
attention
.
<EOS>
and
then
a
journey
to
Lord
Davers
's
,
and
that
noble
pair
accompany
us
to
Kent
;
and
daily
and
hourly
pleasure
crowd
upon
us

narrow
and
confine
as
our

(
<EOS>
though
we
go
with
as
few
attendant
as
possible
)
,
engross
more
of
my

.
<EOS>
thus
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
,
because
,
as
soon
as
I
return
,
I
set
about
write
this
,
as
an
excuse
for
myself
,
in
the
first
place
;
to
promise
you
the
subject
you
insist
upon
,
in
the
next
;
and
to
say
,
that
I
be
incapable
of
forgetfulness
or
negligence
to
such
a
friend
as
Lady

<EOS>
for
I
must
always
be
your
faithful
and
affectionate
humble
servant
,
P.B.
    
my
DEAR
LADY
G.
,
  
<EOS>
the
remark
,
your
cousin
fielding
say
,
I
have
make
on
the
subject
of
young
gentleman
's
travelling
,
and
which
you
request
me
to
communicate
to
you
,
be
part
of
a
little
book
upon
education
,
which
I
write
for
Mr.
B.
's
correction
and
amendment
,
on
his
put
Mr.
Locke
's
treatise
on
that
subject
into
my
hand
,
and
require
my
observation
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
flatter
myself
they
will
answer
your
expectation
;
for
I
be
sensible
they
must
be
unworthy
even
of
the
opportunity
I
have
have
in
the
excursion
,
in
which
I
have
be
indulge
by
the
good
of
man
.
<EOS>
but
your
request
be
so
many
law
to
me
;
and
I
will
give
you
a
short
abstract
of
what
I
read
Miss
Fielding
,
who
have
so
greatly
overrate
it
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
's
book
contain
many
excellent
rule
on
education
;
but
this
of
travel
<EOS>
I
will
only
refer
you
to
at
present
.
<EOS>
You
will
there
see
his
objection
against
the
age
at
which
young
gentleman
be
send
abroad
,
from
sixteen
to
twenty
-
one
,
the
time
in
all
their
life
,
he
say
,
at
which
young
gentleman
be
the
least
suited
to
these
improvement
,
and
in
which
they
have
the
least
fence
and
guard
against
their
passion
.
  
<EOS>
the
age
he
propose
be
from
seven
to
fourteen
,
because
of
the
advantage
they
will
then
have
to
master
foreign
language
,
and
to
form
their
tongue
to
the
true
pronunciation
;
as
well
as
that
they
will
be
more
easily
direct
by
their
tutor
or
governor
.
<EOS>
or
else
he
propose
that
more
sedate
time
of
life
,
when
the
gentleman
be
able
to
travel
without
a
tutor
,
and
to
make
his
own
observation
;
and
when
he
be
thoroughly
acquaint
with
the
law
and
fashion
,
the
natural
and
moral
advantage
and
defect
of
his
own
country
;
by
which
mean
,
as
Mr.
Locke
wisely
observe
,
the
traveller
will
have
something
to
exchange
with
those
abroad
,
from
whose
conversation
he
hope
to
reap
any
knowledge
.
<EOS>
and
he
support
his
opinion
by
excellent
reason
,
to
which
I
refer
you
.
  
<EOS>
what
I
have
write
in
my
little
book
,
not
yet
quite
finished
on
this
head
,
relate
principally
to
Home
Travelling
,
which
Mr.
B.
be
always
resolve
his
son
should
undertake
,
before
they
enter
upon
a
foreign
tour
.
<EOS>
I
have
there
observe
,
that
England
abound
with
curiosity
,
both
of
art
and
nature
,
worth
the
notice
of
a
diligent
inquirer
,
and
equal
with
some
of
those
we
admire
in
foreign
part
;
and
that
if
the
youth
be
not
send
abroad
at
Mr.
Locke
's
early
time
,
from
seven
to
fourteen
(
which
I
can
hardly
think
will
be
worth
while
,
merely
for
the
sake
of
attain
a
perfection
in
the
language
)
,
he
may
with
good
advantage
begin
,
at
fourteen
or
fifteen
,
the
tour
of
Great
Britain
,
now
-
and
-
then
,
by
excursion
,
in
the
summer
month
,
between
his
other
study
,
and
as
a
diversion
to
him
.
<EOS>
this
I
should
wish
may
be
enter
upon
in
his
papa
's
company
,
as
well
as
his
tutor
's
,
if
it
could
conveniently
be
do
;
who
thus
initiate
both
the
governed
and
governor
in
the
method
he
would
have
observe
by
both
,
will
obtain
no
small
satisfaction
and
amusement
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
father
would
by
this
means
be
an
eye
-
witness
of
the
behaviour
of
the
one
and
the
other
,
and
have
a
speciman
how
fit
the
young
man
be
to
be
trust
,
or
the
tutor
to
be
depend
upon
,
when
they
go
abroad
,
and
be
out
of
his
sight
:
as
they
would
of
what
be
expect
from
them
by
the
father
.
<EOS>
and
hence
a
thousand
benefit
may
arise
to
the
young
gentleman
from
the
occasional
observation
and
reflection
of
his
father
,
with
regard
to
expence
,
company
,
conversation
,
hour
,
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
father
could
not
himself
accompany
his
son
,
he
may
appoint
the
stage
the
young
gentleman
should
take
,
and
enjoin
both
tutor
and
son
to
give
,
at
every
stage
,
an
account
of
whatever
they
observe
curious
and
remarkable
,
not
omit
the
minute
occurrence
.
<EOS>
by
this
means
,
and
the
probability
that
he
may
hear
of
them
,
and
their
proceeding
,
from
his
friend
,
acquaintance
,
and
relation
,
who
may
fall
in
with
them
,
they
would
have
a
great
regard
to
their
conduct
;
and
so
much
the
more
,
if
the
young
gentleman
be
to
keep
an
account
of
his
expence
,
which
,
upon
his
return
,
he
may
lay
before
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
by
see
thus
the
different
custom
,
manner
,
and
economy
of
different
person
and
family
(
for
in
so
mixed
a
nation
as
ours
be
,
there
be
as
great
a
variety
of
that
sort
to
be
meet
with
,
as
in
most
)
,
and
from
their
different
treatment
,
at
their
several
stage
,
a
great
deal
of
the
world
may
be
learn
by
the
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
prepared
to
go
abroad
with
more
delight
to
himself
,
as
well
as
more
experience
,
and
great
reputation
to
his
family
and
country
.
<EOS>
in
such
excursion
as
these
,
the
tutor
would
see
his
temper
and
inclination
,
and
may
notice
to
the
father
any
thing
amiss
,
that
it
may
be
set
right
,
while
the
youth
be
yet
in
his
reach
,
and
more
under
his
inspection
,
than
he
would
be
in
a
foreign
country
;
and
his
observation
,
on
his
return
,
as
well
as
in
his
letter
,
would
shew
how
fit
he
be
to
be
trust
;
and
how
likely
to
improve
,
when
at
a
great
distance
.
  
<EOS>
after
England
and
Wales
,
as
well
the
inland
part
as
the
sea
-
coast
,
let
them
if
they
behave
accord
to
expectation
,
take
a
journey
into
Scotland
and
Ireland
,
and
visit
the
principal
island
,
as
Guernsey
,
Jersey
,
&
c.
<EOS>
the
youth
continue
to
write
down
his
observation
all
the
way
,
and
keep
a
journal
of
occurrence
;
and
let
him
employ
the
little
time
he
will
be
on
board
of
ship
,
in
these
small
trip
from
island
to
island
,
or
coastwise
,
in
observe
upon
the
noble
art
of
navigation
;
of
the
theory
of
which
,
it
will
not
be
amiss
that
he
have
some
notion
,
as
well
as
of
the
curious
structure
of
a
ship
,
its
tackle
,
and
furniture
:
a
knowledge
very
far
from
be
insignificant
to
a
gentleman
who
be
an
islander
,
and
have
a
stake
in
the
great
maritime
kingdom
in
the
world
;
and
hence
he
will
be
teach
to
love
and
value
that
most
useful
and
brave
set
of
man
,
the
british
sailor
,
who
be
the
natural
defence
and
glory
of
the
realm
.
  
<EOS>
Hereby
he
will
confirm
his
theory
in
the
geography
of
the
british
dominion
in
Europe
,
he
will
be
apprise
of
the
situation
,
convenience
,
interest
,
and
constitution
of
his
own
country
;
and
will
be
able
to
lay
a
ground
-
work
for
the
future
government
of
his
thought
and
action
,
if
the
interest
he
bear
in
his
native
country
should
call
him
to
the
public
service
in
either
house
of
parliament
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
foundation
,
how
excellently
would
he
be
qualified
to
go
abroad
!
<EOS>
and
how
properly
then
would
he
add
to
the
knowledge
he
have
attain
of
his
own
country
,
that
of
the
different
custom

<EOS>
how
would
he
be
able
to
form
comparison
,
and
to
make
all
his
inquiry
appear
pertinent
and
manly
.
<EOS>
all
the
occasion
of
that
ignorant
wonder
,
which
render
a
novice
the
jest
of
all
about
him
,
would
be
take
away
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
able
to
ask
question
,
and
to
judge
without
lead
string
.
<EOS>
nor
would
he
think
he
have
see
a
country
,
and
answer
the
end
of
his
father
's
expence
,
and
his
own
improvement
,
by
run
through
a
kingdom
,
and
know
nothing
of
it
,
but
the
inn
and
stage
,
at
which
he
stop
to
eat
and
drink
.
<EOS>
for
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
would
make
the
good
acquaintance
,
and
contract
worthy
friendship
with
such
as
would
court
and
reverence
him
as
one
of
the
rise
genius
of
his
country
.
  
<EOS>
whereas
most
of
the
young
gentleman
who
be
send
abroad
raw
and
unprepared
,
as
if
to
wonder
at
every
thing
they
see
,
and
to
be
laugh
at
by
all
that
see
them
,
do
but
expose
themselves
and
their
country
.
<EOS>
and
if
,
at
their
return
,
by
interest
of
friend
,
by
alliance
,
or
marriage
,
they
should
happen
to
be
promote
to
place
of
honour
or
profit
,
their
unmerited
preferment
will
only
serve
to
make
those
foreigner
,
who
be
eye
-
witness
of
their
weakness
and
folly
,
when
among
them
,
conclude
greatly
in
disfavour
of
the
whole
nation
,
or
,
at

,
of
the
prince
,
and
his
administration
,
who
could
find
no
fitter
subject
to
distinguish
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
my
dear
friend
,
be
a
brief
extract
from
my
observation
on
the
head
of
qualify
young
gentleman
to
travel
with
honour
and
improvement
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
you
will
be
apt
to
think
me
not
a
little
out
of
my
element
;
but
since
you
would
have
it
,
I
claim
the
allowance
of
a
friend
;
to
which
my
ready
compliance
with
your
command
the
rather
entitle
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Murray
be
so
unhappy
in
each
other
.
<EOS>
be
he
a
generous
man
,
the
heavy
loss
the
poor
lady
have
sustain
,
as
well
as
her
sister
,
my
beloved
friend
,
in
so
excellent
a
mother
,
and
so
kind
a
father
,
would
make
him
bear
with
her
infirmity
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
really
,
I
have
see
,
on
twenty
occasion
,
that
notwithstanding
all
the
fine
thing
gentleman
say
to
lady
before
marriage
,
if
the
latter
do
not
improve
upon
their
husband
'
hand
,
their
impute
grace
when
single
,
will
not
protect
them
from
indifference
,
and
,
probably
,
from
bad
;
while
the
gentleman
,
perhaps
,
think
he
only
,
of
the
two
,
be
entitle
to
go
backward
in
act
of
kindness
and
complaisance
.
<EOS>
a
strange
and
shocking
difference
which
too
many
lady
experience
,
who
,
from
fond
lover
,
prostrate
at
their
foot
,
find
surly
husband
,
trample
upon
their
neck
!
  
<EOS>
You
,
my
dear
friend
,
be
happy
in
your
day
of
courtship
,
and
be
no
less
so
in
your
state
of
wedlock
.
<EOS>
and
may
you
continue
to
be
so
to
a
good
old
age
,
pray
your
affectionate
and
faithful
friend
,
<EOS>
P.B.
    
My

<EOS>
I
will
cheerfully
cause
to
be
transcribe
for
you
the
conversation
you
desire
,
between
myself
,
Mrs.
Towers
,
and
Lady
Arthur
,
and
the
three
young
lady
their
relation
,
in
presence
of
the
dean
and
his
daughter
,
and
Mrs.
Brooks
;
and
glad
I
shall
be
,
if
it
may
be
of
use
to
the
two
thoughtless
<EOS>
miss
your
neighbour
;
who
,
you
be
pleased
to
tell
me
,
be
great
admirer
of
my
story
and
my
example
;
and
will
therefore
,
as
you
say
,
pay
great
attention
to
what
I
write
,
than
to
the
more
passionate
and
interested
lesson
of
their
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
only
sorry
you
should
be
concern
about
the
suppose
trouble
you
give
me
,
by
have
mislaid
my
former
relation
of
it
.
<EOS>
for
,
besides
oblige
my
dear
Lady
G.
,
the
hope
of
do
service
by
it
to
a
family
so
worthy
,
in
a
case
so
nearly
affect
its
honour
,
as
to
make
two
headstrong
young
lady
recollect
what
belong
to
their
sex
and
their
character
,
and
what
their
filial
duty
require
of
them
,
afford
me
high
pleasure
;
and
if
it
shall
be
attend
with
the
wish
effect
,
it
will
add
to
my
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
cause
to
be
transcribe
,
because
I
hope
to
answer
a
double
end
by
it
;
for
,
on
reconsideration
,
I
set
Miss
Goodwin
to
transcribe
it
,
who
write
a
pretty
hand
,
and
be
not
a
little
fond
of
the
task
,
nor
,
indeed
,
of
any
task
I
set
her
;
and
will
be
more
affected
as
she
perform
it
,
than
she
could
be
by
read
it
only
;
although
she
be
a
very
good
girl
at
present
,
and
give
me
hope
that
she
will
continue
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
inclose
it
when
do
,
that
it
may
be
read
to
the
party
without
this
introduction
,
if
you
think
fit
.
<EOS>
and
you
will
forgive
me
for
have
add
a
few
observation
,
with
a
view
to
the
case
of
your
inconsiderate
young
lady
,
and
for
have
correct
the
former
narrative
in
several
place
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Lady
G.
,
  
<EOS>
the
paper
you
have
mislay
,
as
to
the
conversation
between
me
and
the
young
lady
,
relation
of
Mrs.
Towers
,
and
Lady
Anne
Arthur
,
in
presence
of
these
two
last
-
name
lady
,
Mrs.
Brooks
,
and
the
worthy
dean
,
and
Miss
L.
(
of
which
,
in
order
to
perfect
your
kind
collection
of
my
communication
you
request
another
copy
)
contain
as
follow
.
  
<EOS>
I
first
state
,
that
I
have
see
these
three
lady
twice
or
thrice
before
,
as
visitor
,
at
their
kinswoman
's
house
so
that
they
and
I
be
not
altogether
stranger
to
one
another
:
and
my
two
neighbour
acquaint
me
with
their
respective
taste
and
disposition
,
and
their
history
preparatory
to
this
visit
,
to
the
follow
effect
:
  
that
MISS
STAPYLTON
be
over
-
run
with
the
love
of
poetry
and
romance
,
and
delight
in
flowery
language
and
metaphorical
flourish
:
be
about
eighteen
,
want
not
either
sense
or
politeness
;
and
have
read
herself
into
a
vein
,
more
amorous
(
that
be
Mrs.
Towers
's
word
)
than
discreet
.
<EOS>
have
extraordinary
notion
of
a
first
sight
love
;
and
give
herself
great
liberty
,
with
a
pair
of
fine
eye
(
in
hope
to
make
sudden
conquest
in
pursuance
of
that
notion
)
,
than
be
pretty
in
her
sex
and
age
;
which
make
those
who
know
her
not
,
conclude
her
bold
and
forward
;
and
be
more
than
suspect
,
with
a
mind
thus
prepare
for
instantaneous
impression
,
to
have
experience
the
argument
to
her
own
disadvantage
,
and
to
be
strike
by
(
before
she
have
stricken
)
a
gentleman
,
whom
her
friend
think
not
at
all
worthy
of
her
,
and
to
whom
she
be
make
some
indiscreet
advance
,
under
the
name
of
PHILOCLEA
to
PHILOXENUS
,
in
a
letter
which
she
entrust
to
a
servant
of
the
family
,
who
,
discover
her
design
,
prevent
her
indiscretion
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
that
,
in
other
respect
,
she
have
no
mean
accomplishment
,
will
have
a
fine
fortune
,
be
genteel
in
her
person
,
though
with
some
visible
affectation
,
dance
well
,
sing
well
,
and
play
prettily
on
several
instrument
;
be
fond
of
reading
,
but
affect
the
action
,
and
air
,
and
attitude
of
a
tragedian
;
and
be
too
apt
to
give
an
emphasis
in
the
wrong
place
,
in
order
to
make
an
author
mean
significantly
,
even
where
the
occasion
be
common
,
and
,
in
a
mere
historical
fact
,
that
require
as
much
simplicity
in
the
reader
's
accent
,
as
in
the
writer
's
style
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
that
when
she
read
a
play
,
she
will
put
herself
into
a
sweat
,
as
Mrs.
Towers
say
;
distort
very
agreeable
feature
,
and
make
a
multitude
of
wry
mouth
with
one
very
pretty
one
,
in
order
to
convince
her
hearer
,
what
a
near
neighbour
her
heart
be
to
her
lip
.
  
<EOS>
miss
COPE
be
a
young
lady
of
nineteen
,
lovely
in
her
person
,
with
a
handsome
fortune
in
possession
,
and
great
prospect
.
<EOS>
have
a
soft
and
gentle
turn
of
mind
,
which
dispose
her
to
be
easily
impose
upon
.
<EOS>
be
address
by
a
libertine
of
quality
,
whose
courtship
,
while
permit
,
be
imperiousness
;
and
whose
tenderness
,
insult
:
have
find
the
young
lady
too
susceptible
of
impression
,
open
and
unreserved
,
and
even
value
him
the
more
,
as
it
seem
,
for
treat
her
with
ungenerous
contempt
;
for
that
she
be
always
make
excuse
for
slight
,
ill
manner
,
and
even
rudeness
,
which
no
other
young
lady
would
forgive
.
  
<EOS>
that
this
docility
on
her
side
,
and
this
insolence
on
his
,
and
an
over
-
free
,
and
even
indecent
degree
of
romp
,
as
it
be
call
,
with
her
,
which
once
her
mamma
surprise
them
in
,
make
her
papa
forbid
his
visit
,
and
her
receive
them
.
  
<EOS>
that
this
however
,
be
so
much
to
Miss
Cope
's
regret
,
that
she
be
detect
in
a
design
to
elope
to
him
out
of
the
private
garden
-
door
;
which
,
have
she
effect
,
in
all
probability
,
the
indelicate
and
dishonourable
peer
would
have
triumph
over
her
innocence
;
have
give
out
since
,
that
he
intend
to
revenge
himself
on
the
daughter
,
for
the
disgrace
he
have
receive
from
the
parent
.
  
<EOS>
that
though
convince
of
this
,
it
be
fear
she
still
love
him
,
and
would
again
throw
herself
in
his
way
;
urge
,
that
his
rash
expression
be
the
effect
only
of
his
passion
;
for
that
she
know
he
love
her
too
well
to
be
dishonourable
to
her
;
and
by
the
same
degree
of
favourable
prepossession
,
she
will
have
it
,
that
his
brutal
roughness
be
the
manliness
of
his
nature
;
that
his
most
shocking
expression
be
sincerity
of
heart
;
that
his
boast
of
former
lewdness
be
but
instance
that
he
know
the
world
;
that
his
freedom
with
her
person
be
but
excess
of
love
and
innocent
gaiety
of
temper
;
that
his
resent
the
prohibition
he
have
meet
with
,
and
his
threat
,
be
other
instance
of
his
love
and
his
courage
:
and
peer
of
the
realm
ought
not
to
be
bind
down
by
little
narrow
rule
like
the
vulgar
;
for
,
truly
,
their
honour
be
in
the
great
case
regard
as
equal
with
the
oath
of
a
common
gentleman
,
and
be
a
security
that
a
lady
may
trust
to
,
if
he
be
not
a
profligate
indeed
;
and
that
Lord
P.
can
not
be
.
  
<EOS>
that
except
these
weakness
,
Miss
have
many
good
quality
;
be
charitable
,
pious
,
humane
,
humble
;
sing
sweetly
,
play
on
the
spinnet
charmingly
;
be
meek
,
fearful
,
and
never
be
resolute
or
courageous
enough
to
step
out
of
the
regular
path
,
till
her
too
flexible
heart
become
touch
with
a
passion
,
that
be
say
to
polish
the
most
brutal
temper
,
and
therefore
her
rough
peer
have
none
of
it
;
and
to
animate
the
dove
,
of
which
Miss
Cope
have
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
that
Miss
Sutton
,
a
young
lady
of
the
like
age
with
the
two
former
,
have
too
lively
and
airy
a
turn
of
mind
;
affect
to
be
think
well
read
in
the
history
of
kingdom
,
as
well
as
in
polite
literature
.
<EOS>
speak
French
fluently
,
talk
much
upon
all
subject
;
and
have
a
great
deal
of
flippant
wit
,
which
make
more
enemy
than
friend
.
<EOS>
however
,
be
innocent
,
and
unsuspectedly
virtuous
hitherto
;
but
make
herself
cheap
and
accessible
to
fop
and
rake
,
and
have
not
the
bad
opinion
of
a
man
for
be
such
.
<EOS>
listen
eagerly
to
story
tell
to
the
disadvantage
of
some
of
her
own
sex
;
though
affect
to
be
a
great
stickler
for
the
honour
of
it
in
general
:
will
unpityingly
propagate
them
:
think
(
without
consider
to
what
the
imprudence
of
her
own
conduct
may
subject
her
)
<EOS>
the
woman
that
slip
inexcusable
;
and
the
man
who
seduce
her
,
much
less
faulty
;
and
thus
encourage
the
one
sex
in
their
vileness
,
and
give
up
the
other
for
their
weakness
,
in
a
kind
of
silly
affectation
,
to
shew
her
security
in
her
own
virtue
;
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
be
dance
upon
the
edge
of
a
precipice
,
presumptuously
inattentive
to
her
own
danger
.
  
<EOS>
the
worthy
dean
,
know
the
lady
'
intention
in
this
visit
to
me
,
bring
his
daughter
with
him
,
as
if
by
accident
;
for
Miss
L.
with
many
good
quality
,
be
of
a
remarkable
soft
temper
,
though
not
so
inconsiderately
soft
as
Miss
Cope
:
but
be
too
credulous
;
and
,
as
her
papa
suspect
,
entertain
more
than
a
liking
to
a
wild
young
gentleman
,
the
heir
to
a
noble
fortune
,
who
make
visit
to
her
,
full
of
tenderness
and
respect
,
but
without
declare
himself
.
<EOS>
this
give
the
dean
much
uneasiness
;
and
he
be
very
desirous
that
his
daughter
should
be
in
my
company
on
all
occasion
,
as
she
be
so
kind
to
profess
a
great
regard
to
my
opinion
and
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
easy
to
see
the
poor
young
lady
be
in
love
;
and
she
make
no
doubt
that
the
young
gentleman
love
her
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
why
then
(
for
he
be
not
a
bashful
man
,
as
you
shall
hear
)
do
he
not
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
deceive
already
two
young
creature
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
caution
the
dean
against
his
son
.
<EOS>
have
tell
him
,
that
he
be
sly
,
subtle
,
full
of
stratagem
,
yet
have
so
much
command
of
himself
(
which
make
him
more
dangerous
)
,
as
not
to
precipitate
his
design
;
but
can
wait
with
patience
till
he
think
himself
secure
of
his
prey
,
and
then
pull
off
the
mask
at
once
;
and
,
if
he
succeed
,
glory
in
his
villainy
.
<EOS>
yet
do
his
father
beg
of
the
dean
to
permit
his
visit
,
for
he
wish
him
to
marry
Miss
L.
though
greatly
unequal
in
fortune
to

the

owe
his
principal
preferment
to
the
old
gentleman
,
care
not
to
disoblige
him
,
or
affront
his
son

without
some
apparent
reason
for
it

especially
as
the
father

wrapt
up
in
him
,
have
no
other
child

and
be
himself
half
afraid
of
him

least

if
too
much

he

fly
out
entirely

<EOS>
so
here
,
Madam

be
four
young
lady
of
like
year

and
different
inclination
and
temper
,
all
of
whom
may
be
say
to
have
danger
to
encounter

result
from
their
respective
disposition

and
who

profess
to
admire
my
character

be
bring
to
me
,
to
be
benefit
,
as
Mrs.
Towers
be
pleased
to
say
,
by
my
conversation

and
all
be
to
be
as
if
accidental
,
none
of
them
know
how
well
I
be
acquaint
with
their
several
character
.
  
<EOS>
how
proud
would
this
compliment
have
make
me
from
such
a
lady
as
Mrs.
Towers
,
have
I
not
be
as
proud
as
proud
could
be
before
,
of
the
good
opinion
of
four
beloved
person
,
Mr.

Lady
Davers

the
Countess

your

We
be
attend
only
by
Polly
Barlow
,
who
in
some
point
be
as
much
concerned
as
any
body

<EOS>
and
this
being
when
Lord
and
Lady
Davers
,
and
the
noble
Countess

be
with
us
,
'
tis
proper
to
say
,
they
be
abroad
together
upon
a
visit
,
from
which

know
how
I

engage

they
excuse
me

<EOS>
the
dean
be
well
known
to
,
and
value
by
,
all
the
lady
;
and
therefore
be
no
manner
of
restraint
upon
the
freedom
of
our
conversation

<EOS>
I
be
in
my
closet
when
they
come
;

Mrs.

have
present
each
young
lady
to
me
when
I
come
down

,

I
can
guess
at
your
employment
,
Mrs.
B.
Writing
,
I
dare
say
?
<EOS>
I
have
often
wish
to
have
you
for
a
correspondent
;
for
every
one
who
can
boast
of
that
favour
,
exalt
you
to
the
sky
,
and
say
,
your
letter
exceed
your
conversation
,
but
I
always
insist
upon
it
that
that
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
always
say
the
most
obliging
thing
in
the
world
of
her
neighbour
:
but
may
not
one
suffer
,
dear
Madam
,
for
these
kind
prepossession
,
in
the
opinion
of
great
stranger
,
who
will
judge
more
impartially
than
your
favour
will
permit
you
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
"
say
Lady
Arthur
,
"
will
be
so
soon
put
out
of
doubt
,
when
Mrs.
B.
begin
to
speak
,
that
we
will
refer
to
that
,
and
to
put
an
end
to
every
thing
that
look
like
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mrs.
B.
,
"
say
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
may
one
ask
,
what
particular
subject
be
at
this
time
your
employment
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
write
(
you
must
know
,
Lady
G.
)
for
the
sake
of
suit
Miss
Stapylton
's
flighty
vein
,
a
little
sketch
of
the
style
she
be
so
fond
of
;
and
hope
for
some
such
opportunity
as
this
question
give
me
,
to
bring
it
on
the
carpet
;
for
my
only
fear
,
with
her
and
Miss
Cope
,
and
Miss
Sutton
,
be
,
that
they
would
deem
me
too
grave
;
and
so
what
should
fall
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
would
make
the
least
impression
upon
them
.
<EOS>
for
the
good
instruction
,
you
know
,
will
be
ineffectual
,
if
the
manner
of
convey
them
be
not
adapt
to
the
taste
and
temper
of
the
person
you
would
wish
to
influence
.
<EOS>
and
moreover
,
I
have
a
view
in
it
,
to
make
this
little
sketch
the
introduction
to
some
future
observation
on
the
stiff
and
affected
style
of
romance
,
which
may
put
Miss
Stapylton
out
of
conceit
with
them
,
and
make
her
turn
the
course
of
her
study
another
way
,
as
I
shall
mention
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
answer
that
I
have
be
meditate
upon
the
misfortune
of
a
fine
young
lady
,
who
have
be
seduce
and
betray
by
a
gentleman
she
love
,
and
who
,
notwithstanding
,
have
the
grace
to
stop
short
(
indeed
,
later
than
be
to
be
wish
)
,
and
to
abandon
friend
,
country
,
lover
,
in
order
to
avoid
any
further
intercourse
with
him
;
and
that
God
have
bless
her
penitence
and
resolution
,
and
she
be
now
very
happy
in
a
neighbouring
dominion
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
fine
subject
,
"
say
Miss
Stapylton
.
<EOS>
"
be
the
gentleman
a
man
of
wit
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
be
the
lady
a
woman
of
taste
?
<EOS>
"
we
condemn
every
man
who
dress
well
,
and
be
not
a
sloven
,
as
a
fop
or
a
coxcomb
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
doubt
,
when
this
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
but
you
hardly
ever
see
a
man
very
nice
about
his
person
and
dress
,
that
have
any
thing
he
think
of
great
consequence
to
himself
to
regard
.
'
<EOS>
tis
natural
it
should
be
so
;
for
should
not
the
man
of
body
take
the
great
care
to
set
out
and
adorn
the
part
for
which
he
think
himself
most
valuable
?
<EOS>
and
will
not
the
man
of
mind
bestow
his
principal
care
in
improve
that
mind
?
<EOS>
perhaps
to
the
neglect
of
dress
,
and
outward
appearance
,
which
be
a
fault
.
<EOS>
but
surely
,
Madam
,
there
be
a
middle
way
to
be
observe
,
in
these
,
as
in
most
other
case
;
for
a
man
nee
not
be
a
sloven
,
any
more
than
a
fop
.
<EOS>
He
need
not
shew
an
utter
disregard
to
dress
,
nor
yet
think
it
his
first
and
chief
concern
;
be
ready
to
quarrel
with
the
wind
for
discompose
his
peruke
,
or
fear
to
put
on
his
hat
,
lest
he
should
depress
his
foretop
;
more
dislike
a
spot
upon
his
clothe
,
than
in
his
reputation
;
be
a
self
-
admirer
,
and
always
at
the
glass
,
which
he
would
perhaps
never
look
into
,
<EOS>
could
it
shew
him
<EOS>
the
deformity
of
his
mind
,
as
well
as
the
finery
of
his
person
;
who
have
a
taylor
for
his
tutor
,
and
a
milliner
for
his
school
-
mistress
;
who
laugh
at
man
of
sense
(
excusably
enough
,
perhaps
in
revenge
because
they
laugh
at
him
)
;
who
call
learn
pedantry
,
and
look
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
fashion
as
the
only
useful
science
to
a
fine
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
lady
<EOS>
;
I
could
proceed
with
the
character
of
this
specie
of
man
,
but
I
need
not
;
for
every
lady
present
would
despise
such
an
one
,
as
much
as
I
do
,
be
he
to
fall
in
her
way
:
or
the
rather
,
because
he
who
admire
himself
,
will
never
admire
his
lady
as
he
ought
;
and
if
he
maintain
his
niceness
after
marriage
,
it
will
be
with
a
preference
to
his
own
person
;
if
not
,
will
sink
,
very
probably
,
into
the
bad
of
sloven
.
<EOS>
for
whoever
be
capable
of
one
extreme
(
take
almost
the
case
of
human
life
through
)
when
he
recede
from
that
,
if
he
be
not
a
man
of
prudence
,
will
go
over
into
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
to
return
to
the
former
subject
"
(
for
the
general
attention
encourage
me
to
proceed
)
,
"
permit
me
,
Miss
Sutton
,
to
add
,
that
a
lady
must
run
great
risk
to
her
reputation
,
if
not
to
her
virtue
,
who
will
admit
into
her
company
any
gentleman
who
shall
be
of
opinion
,
and
know
it
to
be
her
,
that
it
be
his
province
to
ask
a
favour
,
which
it
will
be
her
duty
to
deny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
Madam
,
I
speak
these
word
a
little
too
carelessly
;
but
I
mean
honourable
question
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
but
one
honourable
question
,
"
reply
I
;
"
and
that
be
seldom
ask
,
but
when
the
affair
be
bring
near
a
conclusion
,
and
there
be
a
probability
of
its
be
grant
;
and
which
a
single
lady
,
while
she
have
parent
or
guardian
,
should
never
think
of
permit
to
be
put
to
herself
,
much
less
of
approve
,
nor
,
perhaps
,
as
the
case
may
be
of
deny
.
<EOS>
but
I
make
no
doubt
that
you
mean
honourable
question
.
<EOS>
a
young
lady
of
Miss
Sutton
's
good
sense
,
and
worthy
character
,
could
not
mean
otherwise
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
say
,
perhaps
,
more
than
I
need
upon
the
subject
,
because
we
all
know
how
ready
the
presuming
of
the
other
sex
be
,
right
or
wrong
to
construe
the
most
innocent
meeting
in
favour
of
their
own
view
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
"
say
she
;
but
appear
to
be
under
an
agreeable
confusion
,
every
lady
,
by
her
eye
,
seem
to
think
she
have
meet
with
a
deserved
rebuke
;
and
which
not
seem
to
expect
,
it
abate
her
liveliness
all
the
time
after
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Towers
seasonably
relieve
us
both
from
a
subject
too
applicable
,
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
say
 
"
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Mrs.
B.
,
will
you
favour
us
with
the
result
of
your
meditation
,
if
commit
to
writing
,
on
the
unhappy
case
you
mention
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
rather
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
exercise
my
fancy
than
my
judgment
,
such
as
it
be
,
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
be
aim
at
a
kind
of
allegorical
or
metaphorical
style
,
I
know
not
which
to
call
it
;
and
it
be
not
fit
to
be
read
before
such
judge
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
o
pray
,
dear
Madam
,
"
say
Miss
Stapylton
,
"
favour
us
with
it
to
choose
;
for
I
be
a
great
admirer
of
that
style
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
great
curiosity
,
"
say
Lady
Arthur
,
"
both
from
the
subject
and
the
style
,
to
hear
what
you
have
write
:
and
I
beg
you
will
oblige
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
short
and
unfinished
.
<EOS>
It
be
write
for
the
sake
of
a
friend
,
who
be
fond
of
such
a
style
;
and
what
I
shall
add
to
it
,
will
be
principally
some
slight
observation
upon
this
way
of
writing
.
<EOS>
but
,
let
it
be
ever
so
censurable
,
I
should
be
more
so
,
if
I
make
any
difficulty
after
such
an
unanimous
request
.
"
<EOS>
so
,
take
it
out
of
my
letter
-
case
,
I
read
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
while
the
bank
of
discretion
keep
the
proud
water
of
passion
within
their
natural
channel
,
all
calm
and
serene
glide
along
the
silver
current
,
enliven
the
adjacent
meadow
,
as
it
pass
,
with
a
bright
and
more
flowery
verdure
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
torrent
of
sensual
love
be
permit
to
descend
from
the
hill
of
credulous
hope
,
they
may
so
swell
the
gentle
stream
,
as
to
make
it
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
be
retain
betwixt
its
usual
bound
.
<EOS>
what
then
will
be
the
consequence
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
the
tree
of
resolution
,
and
the
shrub
of
cautious
fear
,
which
grow
upon
the
frail
mound
,
and
whose
intertwine
root
have
contribute
to
support
it
,
be
loosen
from
their
hold
,
they
,
and
all
that
would
swim
of
the
bank
itself
,
will
be
see
float
on
the
surface
of
the
triumphant
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
here
,
a
dear
lady
,
have
unhappily
fail
,
be
enable
to
set
her
foot
in
the
new
-
make
breach
,
while
yet
it
be
possible
to
stop
it
,
and
to
say
,
with
little
variation
in
the
language
of
that
power
,
which
only
could
enable
her
to
say
it
.
<EOS>
Hither
,
ye
proud
wave
of
dissolute
love
,
although
you
have
come
,
yet
no
farther
SHALL
ye
come
;
be
such
an
instance
of
magnanimous
resolution
and
self
-
conquest
,
as
be
very
rarely
to
be
meet
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Stapylton
seem
pleased
(
as
I
expect
)
,
and
tell
me
,
that
she
should
take
it
for
a
high
favour
,
to
be
permit
,
if
not
improper
,
to
see
the
whole
letter
when
finish
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
would
oblige
her
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
not
expect
,
Madam
,
that
although
I
have
write
what
I
have
read
to
you
,
I
shall
approve
of
it
in
my
observation
upon
it
;
for
I
be
convince
,
that
no
style
can
be
proper
,
which
be
not
plain
,
simple
,
easy
,
natural
and
unaffected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
sure
,
she
be
pleased
to
say
,
that
whatever
my
observation
be
,
they
would
be
equally
just
and
instructive
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
too
,
"
say
the
dean
,
"
will
answer
for
that
;
for
I
dare
say
,
by
what
I
have
already
hear
,
that
Mrs.
B.
will
distinguish
properly
between
the
style
(
and
the
matter
too
)
which
captivate
the
imagination
,
and
that
which
inform
the
judgment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Our
conversation
,
after
this
,
take
a
more
general
turn
;
which
I
think
right
,
lest
the
young
lady
should
imagine
it
be
a
design
thing
against
them
:
yet
it
be
such
,
that
every
one
of
them
find
her
character
and
taste
,
little
or
much
,
concerned
in
it
;
and
all
seem
,
as
Mrs.
Towers
afterwards
observe
to
me
,
by
their
silence
and
attention
,
to
be
busy
in
private
application
.
  
<EOS>
the
dean
begin
it
with
a
high
compliment
to
me
;
have
a
view
,
no
doubt
,
by
his
kind
praise
,
to
make
my
observation
have
the
great
weight
upon
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
it
be
matter
of
great
surprise
to
him
,
that
,
my
tender
year
consider
,
I
should
be
capable
of
make
those
reflection
,
by
which
person
of
twice
my
age
and
experience
may
be
instruct
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
our
attention
,
when
your
lip
begin
to
open
;
and
<EOS>
I
beg
we
may
have
nothing
to
do
,

I
have
have
such
advantage
,
Sir
,
from
the
observation
and
caution
of
my
late
excellent
lady
,
that
do
you
but
know
half
of
them
,
you
would
rather
wonder
I
have
make
no
great
improvement
,
than
that
I
have
make
so
much
.
<EOS>
She
use
to
think
me
pretty
,
and
not
ill
-
temper
,
and
,
of
course
not
incredulous
,
where
I
conceive
a
good
opinion
;
and
be
always
arm
me
on
that
side
,
as
believe
I
may
be
the
object
of
wicked
attempt
,
and
the
rather
,
as
my
low
fortune
subject
me
to
danger
.
<EOS>
for
,
have
I
be
bear
to
rank
and
condition
,
as
these
young
lady
here
,
I
should
have
have
reason
to
think
of
myself
,
as
justly
as
,
no
doubt
,
they
do
,
and
,
of
consequence
,
beyond
the
reach
of
any
vile
intriguer
;
as
I
should
have
be
above
the
great
part
of
that
specie
of
mankind
,
who
,
for
want
of
understanding
or
honour
,
or
through
pernicious
habit
,
give
themselves
up
to
libertinism
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
these
be
great
advantage
,
"
say
Miss
Sutton
;
"
but
in
you
,
they
meet
with
a
surprising
genius
,
'
tis
very
plain
,
Madam
;
and
there
be
not
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
lady
of
England
,
of
your
year
,
who
would
have
improve
by
them
as
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answer
,
that
I
be
much
oblige
by
her
good
opinion
:
and
that
I
have
always
observe
,
the
person
who
admire
any
good
quality
in
another
,
give
a
kind
of
natural
demonstration
,
that
she
have
the
same
in
an
eminent
degree
herself
,
although
,
perhaps
,
her
modest
diffidence
would
not
permit
her
to
trace
the
generous
principle
to
its
source
.
  
<EOS>
the
dean
,
to
renew
the
subject
of
credulity
,
repeat
my
remark
,
that
it
be
safe
,
in
case
where
so
much
depend
upon
the
issue
,
as
a
lady
's
honour
and
reputation
,
to
fear
an
enemy
,
than
to
hope
a
friend
;
and
praise
my
observation
,
that
even
a
weak
enemy
be
not
to
be
too
much
despise
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
have
very
high
notion
of
the
honour
and
value
of
my
own
sex
,
and
very
mean
one
of
the
gay
and
frothy
part
of
the
other
;
insomuch
,
that
I
think
they
could
have
no
strength
,
but
what
be
found
in
our
weakness
:
that
the
difference
of
education
must
give
man
advantage
,
even
where
the
genius
be
naturally
equal
;
besides
,
they
have
generally
more
hardness
of
heart
,
which
make
woman
,
where
they
meet
not
with
man
of
honour
,
engage
with
that
sex
upon
very
unequal
term
;
for
that
it
be
so
customary
with
them
to
make
vow
and
promise
,
and
to
set
light
by
them
,
when
make
,
that
an
innocent
lady
can
not
guard
too
watchfully
against
them
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
should
believe
nothing
they
say
,
or
even
vow
,
but
what
carry
demonstration
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
my
lady
use
often
to
observe
,
there
be
a
time
of
life
in
all
young
person
,
which
may
properly
be
call
the
romantic
,
which
be
a
very
dangerous
period
,
and
require
therefore
a
great
guard
of
prudence
;
that
the
risque
be
not
a
little
augment
by
read
novel
and
romance
;
and
the
poetical
tribe
have
much
to
answer
for
,
by
reason
of
their
heighten
and
inflame
description
,
which
do
much
hurt
to
thoughtless
mind
,
and
lively
imagination

<EOS>
for
to
those
,
she
would
have
it
,
be
principally
owe
,
the
rashness
and
indiscretion
of
soft
and
tender
disposition
:
which
,
in
breach
of
their
duty
,
and
even
to
the
disgrace
of
their
sex
,
too
frequently
set
them
upon
enterprise
,
like
those
they
have
read
in
those
pernicious
writing
,
which
not
seldom
make
them
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
base
design
of
some
wild
intriguer
;
and
even
in
case
where
their
precipitation
end
the
good
,
that
be
to
say
,
in
marriage
,
they
too
frequently
(
in
direct
opposition
to
the
caution
and
command
of
their
try
,
their
experienced
,
and
unquestionable
friend
)
throw
themselves
upon
an
almost
strange
,
who

in

induce
the

give
the
great
attention

I

it

great
presumption

so
high
a

my

<EOS>
nevertheless

I

by

I
should
have
the
benefit
of
instruction

whenever
it
make
them
speak

I
would
not

enter
upon
any

consider
myself

"
I

,
then

Madam

say
Miss
Stapylton

"
you
will
open
the

reason

of

compare

I

such
trite

coarse

you

Will
you

give
us
a
few
caution

instruction
on
a
theme
of
your
own
,
that
a
young
lady
should
rather
fear
too
much
than
hope
too
much
?
<EOS>
a
necessary
doctrine
,
perhaps
;
but
a
difficult
one
to
be
practise
by
one
who
have
begin
to
love
,
and
who
suppose
all
truth
and
honour
in
the
object
of
her
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hope
,
Madam
,
"
say
I
,
"
in
my
opinion
,
should
never
be
unaccompanied
by
fear
;
and
the
more
reason
will
a
lady
ever
have
to
fear
,
and
to
suspect
herself
,
and
doubt
her
lover
,
when
she
once
begin
to
find
in
her
own
breast
an
inclination
to
him
.
<EOS>
for
then
her
danger
be
double
,
since
she
have
herself
(
perhaps
the
more
dangerous
enemy
of
the
two
)
to
guard
against
,
as
well
as
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
may
secretly
wish
the
good
indeed
:
but
what
have
be
the
fate
of
other
may
be
her
own
;
and
though
she
think
it
not
probable
,
from
such
a
faithful
protester
,
as
he
appear
to
her
to
be
,
yet
,
while
it
be
possible
,
she
should
never
be
off
her
guard
:
nor
will
a
prudent
woman
trust
to
his
mercy
or
honour
;
but
to
her
own
discretion
:
and
the
rather
,
because
,
if
he
mean
well
,
he
himself
will
value
her
the
more
for
her
caution
,
since
every
man
desire
to
have
a
virtuous
and
prudent
wife
;
if
not
well
,
she
will
detect
him
the
sooner
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
her
prudence
,
frustrate
all
his
base
design
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
let
me
,
my
dear
lady
,
ask
,
what
that
passion
be
,
which
generally
we
dignify
by
the
name
of
love
;
and
which
,
when
so
dignified
,
put
us
upon
a
thousand
extravagance
?
<EOS>
I
believe
,
if
examine
into
,
it
would
be
find
too
generally
to
owe
its
original
to
ungoverned
fancy
;
and
be
we
to
judge
of
it
by
the
consequence
that
usually
attend
it
,
it
ought
rather
to
be
call
rashness
,
inconsideration
,
weakness
,
and
thing
but
love
;
for
very
seldom
,
I
doubt
,
be
the
solid
judgment
so
much
concerned
in
it
,
as
the
airy
fancy
.
<EOS>
but
when
once
we
dignify
the
wild
mis
-
leader
with
the
name
of
love
,
all
the
absurdity
which
we
read
in
novel
and
romance
take
place
,
and
we
be
induce
to
follow
example
that
seldom
end
happily
but
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
permit
me
further
to
observe
,
that
love
,
as
we
call
it
,
operate
differently
in
the
two
sex
,
as
to
its
effect
.
<EOS>
for
in
woman
it
be
a
creeping
thing
,
in
a
man
an
incroacher
;
and
this
ought
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
to
be
very
seriously
attend
to
.
<EOS>
Miss
Sutton
intimate
thus
much
,
when
she
observe
that
it
be
the
man
's
province
to
ask
,
the
lady
's
to
deny
:
 
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
the
observation
be
just
,
as
to
the
man
's
notion
;
although
,
methink
,
I
would
not
have
a
lady
allow
of
it
,
except
in
case
of
caution
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
doubt
,
therefore
,
which
a
lady
have
of
her
lover
's
honour
,
be
needful
to
preserve
her
own
and
his
too
.
<EOS>
and
if
she
do
him
wrong
,
and
he
should
be
too
just
to
deceive
her
,
she
can
make
him
amend
,
by
instance
of
great
confidence
,
when
she
please
.
<EOS>
but
if
she
have
be
accustom
to
grant
him
little
favour
,
can
she
easily
recal
them
?
<EOS>
and
will
not
the
incroacher
grow
upon
her
indulgence
,
plead
for
a
favour
to
-
day
,
which
be
not
refuse
him
yesterday
,
and
reproach
her
want
of
confidence
,
as
a
want
of
esteem
;
till
the
poor
lady
,
who
,
perhaps
,
have
give
way
to
the
creeping
,
insinuate
passion
,
and
have
avow
her
esteem
for
him
,
put
herself
too
much
in
his
power
,
in
order
to
manifest
,
as
she
think
,
the
generosity
of
her
affection
;
and
so
,
by
degree
,
be
carry
farther
than
she
intend
,
or
nice
honour
ought
to
have
permit
;
and
all
,
because
,
to
keep
up
to
my
theme
,
she
hope
too
much
,

look

much
in

that

Miss

blush

<EOS>
"
but
I
observe
,
"
say
Mrs.

,
"
whenever
you
censure
any
indiscretion

you
seldom
fail
to
give
caution
how
to
avoid

and
pray
let
us
know
what
be
to
be
do
in
this
case
?
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
how
a
young
lady
ought
to
guard
against
and
overcome
the
first
favourable
impression
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
imagine
,
"
reply
I
,
"
a
young
lady
ought
to
do
,
on
any
the
least
favourable
impression
of
the
kind
,
be
immediately
to
withdraw
into
herself
,
as
one
may
say
;
to
reflect
upon
what
she
owe
to
her
parent
,
to
her
family
,
to
her
character
,
and
to
her
sex
;
and
to
resolve
to
check
such
a
random
prepossession
,
which
may
much
more
probably
,
as
I
hint
,
make
her
a
prey
to
the
undeserving
than
otherwise
,
as
there
be
so
many
of
that
character
to
one
man
of
real
merit
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
most
that
I
apprehend
a
first
-
sight
approbation
can
do
,
be
to
inspire
a
liking
;
and
a
liking
be
conquerable
,
if
the
person
will
not
brood
over
it
,
till
she
hatch
it
into
love
.
<EOS>
then
every
man
and
woman
have
a
black
and
a
white
side
;
and
it
be
easy
to
set
the
imperfection
of
the
person
against
the
suppose
perfection
,
while
it
be
only
a
liking
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
busy
fancy
be
permit
to
work
as
it
please
,
uncontrolle
,
then
'
tis
very
likely
,
be
the
lady
but
to
keep
herself
in
countenance
for
receive
first
impression
,
she
will
see
perfection
in
the
object
,
which
no
other
live
soul
can
.
<EOS>
and
it
may
be
expect
,
that
as
a
consequence
of
her
first
indiscretion
,
she
will
confirm
,
as
an
act
of
her
judgment
,
what
her
wild
and
ungoverned
fancy
have
mislead
her
to
think
of
with
so
much
partial
favour
.
<EOS>
and
too
late
,
as
it
probably
may
happen
,
she
will
see
and
lament
her
fatal
,
and
,
perhaps
,
undutiful
error
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
talk
of
the
lady
only
,
"
add
I
(
for
I
see
Miss
Stapylton
be
become
very
grave
)
:
<EOS>
"
but
I
believe
first
-
sight
love
often
operate
too
powerfully
in
both
sex
:
and
where
it
do
so
,
it
will
be
very
lucky
,
if
either
gentleman
or
lady
find
reason
,
on
cool
reflection
,
to
approve
a
choice
which
they
be
so
ready
to
make
without
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
'
Tis
allow
,
"
say
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
that
rash
and
precipitate
love
may
operate
pretty
much
alike
in
the
rash
and
precipitate
of
both
sex
:
and
which
soever
love
,
generally
exalt
the
person
beloved
above
his
or
her
merit
:
but
I
be
desirous
,
for
the
sake
of
us
maiden
lady
,
since
it
be
a
science
in
which
you
be
so
great
an
adept
,
to
have
your
advice
,
how
we
should
watch
and
guard
its
first
incroachment
and
that
you
will
tell
us
what
you
apprehend
give
the
man
most
advantage
over
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
now
,
Mrs.
Towers
,
you
rally
my
presumption

indeed

<EOS>
"
I
admire
you

Madam

reply
she
,

every
thing
you
say

do

I
will
not
forgive
you
to
call
what
I
so
seriously
say

think

raillery

<EOS>
for
my

continue
she

"
I
never

any

these
young

"
<EOS>
(
Miss
Cope
look
a
little
silly
upon
this
.
)
<EOS>
"
and
who
can
better
instruct
us
to
guard
our
heart
,
than
a
lady
who
have
so
well
defend
her
own
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
Madam
,
if
I
must
speak
,
I
think
,
what
give
the
other
sex
the
great
advantage
over
even
many
of
the
most
deserving
one
,
be
that
dangerous
foible
,
the
love
of
praise
,
and
the
desire
to
be
flatter
and
admire
,
a
passion
I
have
observe
to
predominate
,
more
or
less
,
from
sixteen
to
sixty
,
in
most
of
our
sex
.
<EOS>
We
be
too
generally
delighted
with
the
company
of
those
who
extol
our
grace
of
person
or
mind
:
for
,
will
not
a
grateful
lady
study
hard
to
return
a
few
compliment
to
a
gentleman
who
make
her
so
many
!
<EOS>
She
be
concern
to
prove
him
a
man
of
distinguished
sense
,
or
a
polite
man
,
at
least
,
in
regard
to
what
she
think
of
herself
;
and
so
the
flatterer
shall
be
prefer
to
such
of
the
sincere
and
worthy
,
as
can
not
say
what
they
do
not
think
.
<EOS>
and
by
this
mean
many
an
excellent
lady
have
fall
a
prey
to
some
sordid
designer
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
I
think
,
nothing
can
give
gentleman
so
much
advantage
over
our
sex
,
as
to
see
how
readily
a
virtuous
lady
can
forgive
the
capital
fault
of
the
most
abandon
of
the
other
;
and
that
sad
,
sad
notion
,
that
a
reform
rake
make
the
good
husband
;
a
notion
that
have
do
more
hurt
,
and
discredit
too
,
to
our
sex
(
as
it
have
give
more
encouragement
to
the
profligate
,
and
more
discouragement
to
the
sober
gentleman
)
,
than
can
be
easily
imagine
.
<EOS>
a
fine
thing
,
indeed
I
as
if
the
wretch
,
who
have
run
through
a
course
of
iniquity
,
to
the
endangering
of
soul
and
body
,
be
to
be
deem
the
good
companion
for
life
,
to
an
innocent
and
virtuous
young
lady
,
who
be
to
owe
the
kindness
of
his
treatment
to
her
,
to
his
have
never
before
accompany
with
a
modest
woman
;
nor
,
till
his
interest
on
one
hand
(
to
which
his
extravagance
,
perhaps
,
compel
him
to
attend
)
,
and
his
impaired
constitution
on
the
other
,
oblige
him
to
it
,
so
much
as
wish
to
accompany
with
one
;
and
who
always
make
a
jest
of
the
marriage
state
,
and
perhaps
,
of
every
thing
either
serious
or
sacred
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
observe
,
very
well
,
"
say
Mrs.
Towers
:
"
<EOS>
but
people
will
be
apt
to
think
,
that
you
have
less
reason
than
any
of
our
sex
,
to
be
severe
against
such
a
notion
:
for
who
be
a
great
rake
than
a
certain
gentleman
,
and
who
be
a
well
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
reply
I
,
"
the
gentleman
you
mean
,
never
be
a
common
town
rake
:
he
be
a
man
of
sense
,
and
fine
understanding
:
and
his
reformation
,
secondarily
,
as
I
may
say
,
have
be
the
natural
effect
of
those
extraordinary
quality
.
<EOS>
but
also
,
I
will
presume
to
say
,
that
that
gentleman
,
as
he
have
not
many
equal
in
the
nobleness
of
his
nature
,
so
he
be
not
likely
,
I
doubt
,
to
have
many
follower
,
in
a
reformation
begin
in
the
bloom
of
youth
,
upon
self
-
conviction
,
and
altogether
,
humanly
speak
,
spontaneous
.
<EOS>
those
lady
who
would
plead
his
example
,
in
support
of
this
pernicious
notion
,
should
find
out
the
same
generous
quality
in
the
man
,
before
they
trust
to
it
:
and
it
will
then
do
less
harm
;
though
even
then
,
I
could
not
wish
it
to
be
generally
entertain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
really
unaccountable
,
"
say
Mrs.
Towers
,
"
after
all
,
as
Mrs.
B.
,
I
remember
,
say
on
another
occasion
,
that
our
sex
should
not
as
much
insist
upon
virtue
and
sobriety
,
in
the
character
of
a
man
,
as
a
man
,
be
he
ever
such
a
rake
,
do
in
that
of
a
lady
.
<EOS>
and
'
tis
certainly
a
great
encouragement
to
libertinism
,
that
a
wear
-
out
debauchee
should
think
himself
at
any
time
good
enough
for
a
husband
,
and
have
the
confidence
to
imagine
,
that
a
modest
woman
will
accept
of
his
address
,
with
a
preference
of
him
to
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
account
for
it
but
one
way
,
"
say
the
dean
:
"
and
that
is
,
that
a
modest
woman
be
apt
to
be
diffident
of
her
own
merit
and
understanding
<EOS>
and
she
think
this
diffidence
an
imperfection
.
<EOS>
a
rake
never
be
troubled
with
it
:
so
he
have
in
perfection
a
quality
she
think
she
want
;
and
,
know
too
little
_
of
the
world
,
imago
<EOS>
she
mend
the
matter
by
accept
of
one
who
know
too
much
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
well
observe
,
Mr.
Dean

"
say
Mrs.

:
"
but
there
be
another
fault
in
our

which
Mrs.

from

that
the
advantage
the

that
it

<EOS>
the
distance
of
time

enable
me
to
add
what
I
could
not
do

when
I
write
the
account
of
it
,
which
you
have
mislay
:
and
which
take
briefly
,
as
follow
:
  
Miss
Stapylton
be
as
good
as
her
word
,
and
write
down
all
she
could
recollect
of
the
conversation
:
and
I
have
already
send
her
the
letter
she
desire
,
contain
my
observation
upon
the
flighty
style
she
so
much
admired
,
it
have
such
an
effect
upon
her
,
as
to
turn
the
course
of
her
reading
and
study
to
weightier
and
more
solid
subject
;
and
avoid
the
gentleman
she
have
begin
to
favour
,
give
way
to
her
parent
'
recommendation
,

be
happily
married
to
Sir
Jonathan
Barnes

<EOS>
Miss
Cope
come
to
me
a
week
after

with
the
leave

both
her
parent

tarry
with
me
three
day
;
in
which
time
she
open
all
her
heart
to
me
,
and
return
in
such
a
disposition
,
and
with
such
resolution
,
that
she
never
would
see
her
peer
again
;
nor
receive
letter
from
him
,
which
she
own
to
me
she
have
do
clandestinely
before
;
and
she
be
now
the
happy
lady
of
Sir
Michael
Beaumont
,
who
make
her
the
good
of
husband
,
and
permit
her
to
follow
her
charitable
inclination
accord
to
a
scheme
which
she
consult
me
upon
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
L.
,
by
the
dean
's
indulgent
prudence
and
discretion
,
have
escape
her
rake
;
and
upon
the
discovery
of
an
intrigue
he
be
carry
on
with
another

conceive
a
just
abhorrence
of
him
;

be
since
marry

Dr.
Jenkins

with

she
live
very
happily

<EOS>
Miss
Sutton
be
not
quite
so
well
off
as
the
three
former
;
though
not
altogether
so
unhappy
neither
,
in
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
indeed
conquer
her
love
of
dress
and
tinsel
,
and
so
become
the
lady
of
Col
.
Wilson
:
and
they
be
thus
far
easy
in
the
marriage
state
,
that
,
be
seldom
together
,
they
have
probably
a
multitude
of
misunderstanding
;
for
the
colonel
love
gaming
,
in
which
he
be
generally
a
winner
;
and
so
pass
his
time
mostly
in
town
.
<EOS>
His
lady
have
her
pleasure
,
neither
laudable
nor
criminal
one
,
which
she
pursue
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
and
now
and
then
a
letter
pass
on
both
side
,
by

<EOS>
the
inscription
and
subscription
of
which
they
remind
one
another
that
they
have
be
once
in
their
life
at
one
church
together
,
  
<EOS>
and
what
now
,
my
dear
Lady
G.
,
have
I
to
add
to
this
tedious
account
(
for
letter
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
call
it
)
but
that
I
be
,
with
great
affection
,
your
true
friend

P.B.
    
my
DEAR
LADY
G.
,
  
<EOS>
You
desire
to
have
a
little
speciman
of
my
nursery
tale
and
story
,
with
which
,
as
Miss
Fenwick
tell
you
,
on
her
return
to
Lincolnshire
,
I
entertain
my
Miss
Goodwin
and
my
little
boy
.
<EOS>
but
you
make
me
too
high
<EOS>
a
compliment
,
when
you
tell
me
,
it
be
for
your
own
instruction
and
example
.
<EOS>
yet
you
know
,
my
dear
Lady
G.
,
be
your
motive
what
they
will
,
I
must
obey
you
,
although
,
be
other
to
see
it
,
I
may
expose
myself
to
the
smile
and
contempt
of
judge
less
prejudiced
in
my
favour
.
<EOS>
so
I
will
begin
without
any
further
apology
;
and
,
as
near
as
I
can
,
give
you
those
very
story
with
which
Miss
Fenwick
be
so
pleased
,
and
of
which
she
have
make
so
favourable
a
report
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
acquaint
you
,
then
,
that
my
method
be
to
give
character
of
person
I
have
know
in
one
part
or
other
of
my
life
,
in
feign
name
,
whose
conduct
may
serve
for
imitation
or
warning
to
my
dear
attentive
Miss
;
and
sometimes
I
give
instance
of
good
boy
and
naughty
boy
,
for
the
sake
of
my
Billy
and
my
daver
;
and
they
be
continually
come
about
me
,
"
Dear
Madam
,
a
pretty
story
,
"
now
cry
Miss
:
"
and
dear
mamma
,
tell
me
of
good
boy
,
and
of
naughty
boy
,
"
cry
Billy
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
be
a
surprising
child
of
her
age
,
and
be
very
familiar
with
many
of
the
good
character
in
the
Spectators
;
and
have
a
smattering
of
Latin
,
and
more
than
a
smattering
of
italian
,
and
be
a
perfect
mistress
of
French
,
be
seldom
at
a
loss
for
a
derivation
of
such
word
as
be
not
of
english
original
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
shall
give
you
a
story
in
feign
name
,
with
which
she
be
so
delighted
,
that
she
have
write
it
down
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
first
trespass
on
your
patience
with
one
of
my
childish
tale
.
  
<EOS>
every
day
,
once
or
twice
,
I
cause
Miss
Goodwin
,
who
play
and
sing
very
prettily
,
to
give
a
tune
or
two
to
me
,
my
Billy
and
my
daver
,
who
,
as
well
as
my
Pamela
,
love
and
learn
to
touch
the
key
,
young
as
the
latter
be
;
and
she
will
have
a
sweet
finger
;
I
can
observe
that
;
and
a
charming
ear
;
and
her
voice
be
music
itself!-"O
the
fond
,
fond
mother

"
I
know
you
will
say

on

this

<EOS>
then

Madam

hand

together

the
nursery

Jemmy

and
in
this
happy
retirement
,
so
much
my
delight

the
absence

imagine

surround
with
the
joy

the
hope
of
my
future
prospect
,
as
well
as
my
present
comfort

<EOS>
Miss
Goodwin

imagine

see

on
my

,
sit
on
a
velvet
stool
,
because
she
be
eld

a

Billy
on

in
a
little
cane
elbow

my
more
delighted

and
my
sweet

natured
promising
Jemmy

in
my

the
nurse
and
the

just
behind

and
the
nursery
maid
delightedly
pursue
some
useful
needle
-
work
for
the
dear
charmer
of
my
heart
<EOS>
-
all
as
hush
and
as
still
as
silence
itself
,
as
the
pretty
creature
generally
be
,
when
their
little
,
watchful
eye
see
my
lip
begin
to
open
:
for
they
take
neat
notice
already
of
my
rule
of
two
ear
to
one
tongue
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
if
Billy
or
Davers
be
either
of
them
for
break
the
mum
,
as
they
call
it
,
they
be
immediately
hush
,
at
any
time
,
if
I
put
my
finger
to
my
lip
,
or
if
Miss
point
her
to
her
ear
,
even
to
the
breaking
of
a
word
in
two
,
as
it
be
:
and
yet
all
my

be
as
lively
as
so
many

while
my

be
cheerful

easy

soft

gentle

always

modest

harmless

they
would
do
nothing
that
their

bid
them
do
;
be
always
quarrel
,
scratch
,
and
fighting
;
would
not
say
their
prayer
;
would
not
learn
their
book
;
so
that
the
little
boy
use
to
laugh
at
them

and
point
at
them
,
as
they
go
along
,
for
blockhead
;

nobody
love

take
notice
of

except
to
beat

thump
them
about

for

their
undutifulness
to
their
poor

who
work
hard
to
maintain
them

as
they
grow
up
,
they
grow
bad

bad
,

more

more
stupid

ignorant
;
so
that
they
impoverish
their
poor
mother
,
and
at
last
break
her
heart
,
poor
poor
widow
woman

<EOS>
and
her
neighbour
join
together
to
bury
the
poor

for

sad
ungracious
child
make
away
with
what
little
she
have
leave

she
be
ill

before
her
heart
be
quite
broken

this
help
to
break
it
the
sooner
:
for
have
she
live
<EOS>

she
see
she
must
have
want
bread

have
no
comfort

such
wicked
child

<EOS>
"
poor
poor

say
my

with
tear

what
become

the
naughty

and
the
naughty
girl
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
become
of
them
!
<EOS>
why
one
son
be
force
to
go
to
sea
,
and
there
he
be
drown
:
another
turn
thief
(
for
he
would
not
work
)
,
and
he
come
to
an
untimely
end
:
the
third
be
idle
and
ignorant
,
and
nobody
,
who
know
how
he
use
his
poor
mother
,
would
employ
him
;
and
so
he
be
force
to
go
into
a
far
country
,
and
beg
his
bread
.
<EOS>
and
the
naughty
girl
,
have
never
love
work
,
pine
away
in
sloth
and
filthiness
,
and
at
last
break
her
arm
,
and
die
of
a
fever
,
lamenting
,
too
late
,
that
she
have
be
so
wicked
a
daughter
to
so
good
a

<EOS>
and
so
there
be
a
sad
end
to
all
the
four
ungracious
child
,
who
never
would
mind
what
their
poor
mother
say
to
them

and
God
punish
their
naughtiness
as
you
see

<EOS>
while
the
good
child
I
mention
before
,
be
the
glory
of
their
family

the
delight
of
every

that
know
them

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
would
not
be
good
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
inference
:
and
the
repetition
from
Billy
,
with
his
hand
clapt
together
,
"
poor
widow
woman
!
"
<EOS>
give
me
much
pleasure

<EOS>
so
my
childish
story
end
,
with
a
kiss
of
each
pretty
dear
,
and
their
thank
for
my
story
:
and
then
come
on
Miss
's
request
for
a
woman
's
story
,
as
she
call
it
.
<EOS>
I
dismiss
my
baby
to
their
play
;
and
take
Miss
's
hand
,
she
stand
before
me
,
all
attention
,
begin
in
a
more
womanly
strain
to
her
;
for
she
be
very
fond
of
be
think
a
woman
;
and
indeed
be
a
prudent
sensible
dear
,
comprehend
any
thing
instantly
,
and
make
very
pretty
reflection
upon
what
she
hear
or
read
as
you
will
observe
in
what
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
,
my
dear
Miss
Goodwin
,
that
young
lady
should
be
so
watchful
over
,
as
their
reputation
:
'
tis
a
tender
flower
that
the
least
frost
will
nip
,
the
least
cold
wind
will
blast
;
and
when
once
blast
,
it
will
never
flourish
again
,
but
wither
to
the
very
root
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
have
tell
you
so
often
,
I
need
not
repeat
what
I
have
say
.
<EOS>
so
to
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
four
pretty
lady
live
in
one
genteel
neighbourhood
,
daughter
of
four
several
family
;
but
all
companion
and
visitor
;
and
yet
all
of
very
different
inclination
.
<EOS>
coquetilla
we
will
call
one
,
Prudiana
another
,
profusiana
the
third
,
and
Prudentia
the
fourth
;
their
several
name
denote
their
respective
quality
.
  
<EOS>
"
Coquetilla
be
the
only
daughter
of
a
worthy
baronet
,
by
a
lady
very
gay
,
but
rather
indiscreet
than
unvirtuous
,
who
take
not
the
requisite
care
of
her
daughter
's
education
,
but
let
her
be
over
-
run
with
the
love
of
fashion
,
dress
,
and
equipage
;
and
when
in
London
,
ball
,
opera
,
play
,
the
Park
,
the
ring
,
the
withdrawing
-
room
,
take
up
her
whole
attention
.
<EOS>
She
admire
nobody
but
herself
,
flutter
about
,
laugh
at
,
and
despise
a
crowd
of
man
-
follower
,
whom
she
attract
by
gay
,
thoughtless
freedom
of
behaviour
,
too
nearly
tread
on
the
skirt
of
immodesty
:
yet
make
she
not
one
worthy
conquest
,
exciting
,
on
the
contrary
,
in
all
sober
mind
,
that
contempt
of
herself
,
which
she
so
profusely
would
be
think
to
pour
down
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
after
she
have
several
year
flutter
about
the
dangerous
light
,
like
some
silly
fly
,
she
at
last
singe
the
wing
of
her
reputation
;
for
,
be
despise
by
every
worthy
heart
,
she
become
too
easy
and
cheap
a
prey
to
a
man
the
most
unworthy
of
all
her
follower
,
who
have
resolution
and
confidence
enough
to
break
through
those
few
cobweb
reserve
,
in
which
she
have
encircle
her
precarious
virtue
;
and
which
be
no
long
of
force
to
preserve
her
honour
,
when
she
meet
with
a
man
more
bold
and
more
enterprising
than
herself
,
and
who
be
as
design
as
she
be
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
and
what
then
become
of
Coquetilla?-Why
,
she
be
force
to
pass
over
sea
to
Ireland
,
where
nobody
know
her
,
and
to
bury
herself
in
a
dull
obscurity
;
to
go
by
another
name
,
and
at
last
,
unable
to
support
a
life
so
unsuitable
to
the
natural
gaiety
of
her
temper
,
she
pine
herself
into
a
consumption
,
and
die
,
unpitied
and
unlamented
,
among
stranger
,
have
not
one
friend
but
whom
she
buy
with
her
money
.

<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Coquetilla
!
"
say
Miss
Goodwin
;
"
what
a
sad
thing
it
be
to
have
a
wrong
education
;
and
how
happy
be
I
,
who
have
so
good
a
lady
to
supply
the
place
of
a
dear
distant
<EOS>
mamma!-But
be
pleased
,
Madam
,
to
proceed
to
the
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prudiana
,
my
dear
,
be
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
who
be
a
widower
,
and
have
,
while
the
young
lady
be
an
infant
,
bury
her
mamma
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
sort
of
man
;
but
have
but
one
lesson
to
teach
to
Prudiana
,
and
that
be
to
avoid
all
sort
of
conversation
with
the
man
;
but
never
give
her
the
right
turn
of
mind
,
nor
instill
into
it
that
sense
of
her
religious
duty
,
which
would
have
be
her
good
guard
in
all
temptation
.
<EOS>
for
,
provide
she
keep
out
of
the
sight
and
conversation
of
the
gentleman
,
and
avoid
the
company
of
those
lady
who
more
freely
converse
with
the
other
sex
,
it
be
all
her
papa
desire
of
her
.
<EOS>
this
give
her
a
haughty
,
sullen
,
and
reserve
turn
;
make
her
stiff
,
formal
,
and
affect
.
<EOS>
She
have
sense
enough
to
discover
early
the
fault
of
Coquetilla
,
and
,
in
dislike
to
them
,
fall
the
more
easily
into
that
contrary
extreme
,
which
a
recluse
education
,
and
her
papa
's
caution
,
naturally
lead
her
.
<EOS>
so
that
pride
,
reserve
,
affectation
,
and
censoriousness
,
make
up
the
essential
of
her
character
,
and
she
become
more
unamiable
even
than
Coquetilla
;
and
as
the
other
be
too
accessible
,
Prudiana
be
quite
unapproachable
by
gentleman
,
and
unfit
for
any
conversation
,
but
that
of
her
servant
,
be
also
desert
by
those
of
her
own
sex
,
by
whom
she
may
have
improve
,
on
account
of
her
censorious
disposition
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
the
consequence
?
<EOS>
why
this
:
every
worthy
person
of
both
sex
despise
her
,
and
she
be
use
to
see
nobody
but
servant
,
at
last
throw
herself
upon
one
of
that
class
<EOS>
:
in
an
evil
hour
,
she
find
something
that
be
take
to
her
low
taste
in
the
person
of
her
papa
's
valet
,
a
wretch
so
infinitely
beneath
her
<EOS>
(
but
a
gay
coxcomb
of
a
servant
)
,
that
every
body
attribute
to
her
the
scandal
of
make
the
first
advance
;
for
,
otherwise
,
it
be
presume
,
he
durst
not
have
look
up
to
his
master
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
so
here
end
all
her
pride
.
<EOS>
all
her
reserve
come
to
this
!
<EOS>
Her
censoriousness
of
other
redouble
people
's
contempt
upon
herself
,
and
make
nobody
pity
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
finally
turn
out
of
door
,
without
a
penny
of
fortune
:
the
fellow
be
force
to
set
up
a
barber
's
shop
in
a
country
town
;
for
all
he
know
be
to
shave
and
dress
a
peruke
:
and
her
papa
would
never
look
upon
her
more
:
so
that
Prudiana
become
the
outcast
of
her
family
,
and
the
scorn
of
all
that
know
her
;
and
be
force
to
mingle
in
conversation
and
company
with
the
wretch
of
her
husband
's
degree
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
,
miserable
Prudiana
!
"
say
Miss
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
sad
,
sad
fall
be
her
.
<EOS>
and
all
owe
to
the
want
of
a
proper
education
too
!
 
<EOS>
and
to
the
loss
of
such
a
mamma
,
as
I
have
an
aunt
;
and
so
wise
a
papa
as
I
have
an
uncle
!
 
<EOS>
how
could
her
papa
,
I
wonder
,
restrain
her
person
as
he
do
,
like
a
poor
nun
,
and
make
her
unacquainted
with
the
generous
restraint
of
the
mind
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
my
dear
good
aunt
,
it
will
be
owe
to
you

that
I

Your

surround

the
good

with
worthy

well

you
instruct

to
judge
of
both

and
of
every
new
guest

in
such
a
manner
,
as
make
me
esteem
them
all

and
censure
nobody

yet
to
see
fault
in
some
to
avoid

grace
in

to
imitate

attract

admiration
to

<EOS>

You
be
young
,
yet
,
my
love
,
and
must
always
doubt
your
own

and
pray
to
God
,
more

more
,
as
your

to
give

more

more
prudence
,
and
watchfulness
over
your

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
yet
,
my
dear
,
you
must
think
justly
of
yourself
too
;
for
let
the
young
gentleman
be
ever
so
learn
and
discreet
,
your
education
entitle
you
to
think
as
well
of
yourself
as
of
them
:
for
,
do
not
you
see
,
the
lady
who
be
so
kind
as
to
visit
us
,
that
have
not
be
abroad
,
as
you
have
be
,
when
they
be
young
,
yet
make
as
good
figure
in
conversation
,
<EOS>
say
as
good
thing
as
any
of
the
gentleman
?
<EOS>
for
,
my
dear
,
all
that
the
gentleman
know
more
than
the
lady
,
except
here
and
there
such
a
one
as
your
dear
uncle
,
with
all
their
learn
education
,
be
only
,
that
they
have
be
discipline
,
perhaps
,
into
an
observation
of
a
few
accuracy
in
speech
,
which
,
if
they
know
no
more
,
rather
distinguish
the
pedant
than
the
gentleman
:
such
as
the
avoiding
of
a
false
concord
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
which
you
know
how
to
do
,
as
well
as
the
good
;
not
to
put
a
be
for
a
were
,
an
be
for
an
is
,
and
to
be
able
to
speak
in
mood
and
tense
,
and
such
like
valuable
part
of
education
:
so
that
,
my
dear
,
you
can
have
no
reason
to
look
upon
that
sex
in
so
high
a
light
,
as
to
depreciate
your
own
:
<EOS>
and
yet
you
must
not
be
proud
nor
conceite
neither
;
but
make
this
one
rule
your
guide
:
  
"
<EOS>
in
your
maiden
state
,
think
yourself
above
the
gentleman
,
and
they
will
think
you
so
too
,
and
address
you
with
reverence
and
respect
,
if
they
see
there
be
neither
pride
nor
arrogance
in
your
behaviour
,
but
a
consciousness
of
merit
,
a
true
dignity
,
such
as
become
virgin
modesty
,
and
untainted
purity
of
mind
and
manner
,
like
that
of
an
angel
among
man
;
for
so
young
lady
should
look
upon
themselves
to
be
,
and
will
then
be
treat
as
such
by
the
other
sex
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
your
married
state
,
which
be
a
kind
of
state
of
humiliation
for
a
lady
,
you
must
think
yourself
subordinate
to
your
husband
;
for
so
it
have
please
God
to
make
the
wife
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
no
will
of
your
own
,
in
petty
thing
;
and
if
you
marry
a
gentleman
of
sense
and
honour
,
such
a
one
as
your
uncle
,
he
will
look
upon
you
as
his
equal
;
and
will
exalt
you
the
more
for
your
abase
yourself
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
dear
,
he
will
act
by
you
,
just
as
your
dear
uncle
do
by
me
:
and
then
,
what
a
happy
creature
will
you
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
shall
,
Madam

<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
shall
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
I
shall
be
happy
whenever
I
marry

because
I
have
such
wise
director
,
and
<EOS>
such
an
example
,
before
me
:
and
,
if
it
please
God

I
will
never

constant
advice

who
be

why
the
next
be
Profusiana

you
may
remember

my

<EOS>
Profusiana
take
another
course
to
her
ruin

<EOS>
She
fall
into
some
of
Coquetilla
's
foible
,
but
pursue
them
for
another
end
,
and
in
another
manner
.
<EOS>
strike
with
the
grandeur
and
magnificence
of
what
weak
people
call
the
upper
life
,
she
give
herself
up
to
the
circus
,
to
ball
,
to
opera
,
to
masquerade
,
and
assembly
;
affect
to
shine
at
the
head
of
all
company
,
at
Tunbridge
,
at
Bath
,
and
every
place
of
public
resort
;
play
high
,
be
always
receive
and
pay
visit
,
give
ball
,
and
make
treat
and
entertainment
;
and
be
so
much
above
the
conduct
which
mostly
recommend
a
young
lady
to
the
esteem
of
the
deserving
of
the
other
sex
,
that
no
gentleman
,
who
prefer
solid
happiness
,
can
think
of
address
her
,
though
she
be
a
fine
person
,
and
have
many
outward
grace
of
behaviour

<EOS>
She
become
the
favourite
toast
of
the
place
she
frequent

be
proud
of
that
distinction
;
give
the
fashion
,

delight
in
the
pride

that
she
can
make
ape
in
imitation

whenever
she

yet
endeavour

avoid
be

proud

make
herself
cheap
,
and
be
the
subject
of
the
attempt
of
every
coxcomb
of
eminence
;

with
much
ado
,
preserve
her
virtue
,

not
her
character

<EOS>
"
what
,
all
this
while
,
be
poor
Profusiana
do
?
<EOS>
She
would
be
glad
,
perhaps
,
of
a
suitable
proposal
,
and
would
,
it
may
be
,
give
up
some
of
her
gaiety
and
extravagance
:
for
Profusiana
have
wit
,
and
be
not
totally
destitute
of
reason
,
when
she
suffer
herself
to
think
.
<EOS>
but
her
conduct
procure
her
not
one
solid
friendship

she
have
not
in
a
twelvemonth
,
among
a
thousand
profession
of
service
,
one
devoir
that
she
can
attend
to
,
or
a

that
she
can
depend
upon

<EOS>
all
the
woman
she
see
,
if
she
excel
them

hate
her

the
gay
part
of
the
man
,
with
whom
she
accompany
most

be
all
in
a
plot
against
her
honour

<EOS>
even
the

whose
conduct
in
the
general
be
govern
by
principle
of
virtue
,
come
down
to
these
public
place
to
partake
of
the
innocent
freedom
allow
there
,
and
oftentime
give
themselves
air
of
gallantry
,
and
never
have
it
in
their
thought
to
commence
a
treaty
of
marriage
with
an
acquaintance
begin
upon
that
gay
spot

<EOS>
what
solid
friendship

satisfaction

Profusiana
exclude
from

<EOS>
"
Her
name
indeed
be
write
in
every
public
window
,
and
prostitute
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
at
the
pleasure
of
every
profligate
or
sot
,
who
wear
a
diamond
to
engrave
it
:
and
that
it
may
be
,
with
most
vile
and
barbarous
imputation
and
freedom
of
word
,
add
by
rake
,
who
very
probably
never
exchange
a
syllable

her

the
wounded
tree
be
perhaps
also
teach
to
wear
the
initial
of
her
name

link
,
not
unlikely
,
and
widen
as
they
grow
,
with
those
of
a
scoundrel

<EOS>
but
all
this
while
she
make
not
the
least
impression
upon
one
noble
heart
:
and
at
last
,
perhaps
,
have
run
on
to
the
end
of
an
uninterrupted
race
of
folly
,
she
be
cheat
into
the
arm
of
some
vile
fortune

hunter

who
quickly
lavish
away
the
remain
of
that
fortune

her
extravagance
have
leave
;
and
then
,
after
the
bad
usage
,
abandon
her
with
contempt
,
she
sink
into
an
obscurity
that
cut
short
the
thread
of
her
life
,

leave
no
remembrance

on
the
brittle
glass

still

tell

whisperingly

stop

till
she
arrive
at
the

it
be
not

in
some
sort
act
like
the
ancient
Romans

who
would
not
assign
punishment

atrocious
crime

because
they
have
such
an
high
idea

to
suppose

them

I

you

see
those

when

should

shocking
