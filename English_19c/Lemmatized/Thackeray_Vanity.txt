the
Fair
,
a
feeling
of
profound
melancholy
come
over
him
in
his
survey
of
the
bustling
place
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
quantity
of
eating
and
drink
,
make
love
and
jilt
,
laugh
and
the
contrary
,
smoking

poor
old
rouged
tumbler
,
while
the
light

finger
folk
be
operate
upon
their

behind
.
<EOS>
yes
,
this
be
VANITY
FAIR
;
not
a
moral
place
certainly
;
nor
a
merry
one
,
though
very
noisy
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
the
face
of
the
actor
and
buffoon
when
they
come
off
from
their
business
;
and
Tom
Fool
wash
the
paint
off
his
cheek
before
he
sit
down
to
dinner
with
his
wife
and
the
little
Jack
Puddings
behind
the

.
  
<EOS>
the

will
be
up
presently
,
and
he
will
be
turn
over
head
and
heel
,
and
cry
,
<EOS>
"
how
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
man
with
a
reflective
turn
of
mind
,
walk
through
an
exhibition
of
this
sort
,
will
not
be
oppress
,
I
take
it
,
by
his
own
or
other
people
's
hilarity
.
  
<EOS>
an
episode
of
humour
or
kindness
touch
and
amuse
him
here
<EOS>
and
there
 
a
pretty
child
look
at
a
gingerbread
stall
<EOS>
;
a
pretty
girl
blush
whilst
her
lover
talk
to
her
and
choose
her
fairing
;
poor
Tom
Fool
,
yonder
behind
the
waggon
,
mumble
his
bone
with
the
honest
family
which
live
by
his
tumbling
;
but
the
general
impression
be
one
more
melancholy
than
mirthful
.
 
<EOS>
when
you
come
home
you
sit
down
in
a
sober
,
contemplative
,
not
uncharitable
frame
of
mind
,
and
apply
yourself
to
your
book

your

<EOS>
I
have
no
other
moral
than
this
to
tag
to
the
present
story
of
"
Vanity
Fair
.
<EOS>
"
some
people
consider
Fairs
immoral
altogether
,
and
eschew
such
,
with
their
servant
and
family
:
very
likely
they
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
but
person
who
think
otherwise
,
and
be
of
a
lazy
,
or
a
benevolent
,
or
a
sarcastic
mood
,
may
perhaps
like
to
step
in
for
half
an
hour
,
and
look
at
the
performance
.
<EOS>
there
be
scene
of
all
sort
;
some
dreadful
combat
,
some
grand
and
lofty
horse
-
riding
,
some
scene
of
high
life
,
and
some
of
very
middling
indeed
;
some
love
-
making
for
the
sentimental
,
and
some
light
comic
business
;
the
whole
accompany
by
appropriate
scenery
and
brilliantly
illuminate
with
the
author
's
own
candle
.
  
<EOS>
what
more
have
the

of

to
say
?
 
<EOS>
to
acknowledge
the
kindness
with
which

<EOS>
He

proud
to
think
that
his

have
give
satisfaction
to
the
very
good
company
in
this
empire

<EOS>
the
famous
little
Becky
Puppet
have
be
pronounce
to
be
uncommonly
flexible
in

remark
the
richly

<EOS>
"
well

it

<EOS>
and
so

off

exceedingly
flurried

<EOS>
Miss
Sedley
's
papa
be
a
merchant
in
London
,
and
a
man
of
some
wealth
;
whereas
Miss
Sharp
be
an
article
pupil
,
for
whom
Miss
Pinkerton
have
do
,
as
she
think
,
quite
enough
,
without
confer
upon
her
at
part
the
high
honour
of
the
Dixonary
.
  
<EOS>
although
schoolmistress
'
letter
be
to
be
trust
no
more
nor
less
than
churchyard
epitaph
;
yet
,
as
it
sometimes
happen
that
a
person
depart
this
life
who
be
really
deserve
of
all
the
praise
the
stone
cutter
carve
over
his
bone
;
who
be
a
good
Christian
,
a
good
parent
,
child
,
wife
,
or
husband
;
who
actually
do
leave
a
disconsolate
family
to
mourn
his
loss
;
so
in
academy
of
the
male
and
female
sex
it
occur
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
that
the
pupil
be
fully
worthy
of
the
praise
bestow
by
the
disinterested
instructor
.
<EOS>
now
,
Miss
Amelia
Sedley
be
a
young
lady
of
this
singular
specie
;
and
deserve
not
only
all
that
Miss
Pinkerton
say
in
her
praise
,
but
have
many
charming
quality
which
that
pompous
old
Minerva
of
a
woman
could
not
see
,
from
the
difference
of
rank
and
age
between
her
pupil
and
herself
.
  
<EOS>
for
she
could
not
only
sing
like
a
lark
,
or
a
Mrs.
Billington
,
and
dance
like
Hillisberg
or
Parisot
;
and
embroider
beautifully
;
and
spell
as
well
as
a
Dixonary
itself
;
but
she
have
such
a
kindly
,
smile
,
tender
,
gentle
,
generous
heart
of
her
own
,
as
win
the
love
of
everybody
who
come
near
her
,
from
Minerva
herself
down
to
the
poor
girl
in
the
scullery
,
and
the
one
-
eyed
tart
-
woman
's
daughter
,
who
be
permit
to
vend
her
ware
once
a
week
to
the
young
lady
in
the
Mall
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
twelve
intimate
and
bosom
friend
out
of
the
twenty
-
four
young
lady
.
<EOS>
even
envious
Miss
Briggs
never
speak
ill
of
her
;
high
and
mighty
Miss
Saltire
(
Lord
Dexter
's
granddaughter
)
allow
that
her
figure
be
genteel
;
and
as
for
Miss
Swartz
,
the
rich
woolly
-
haired
mulatto
from
St.
Kitt
's
,
on
the
day
Amelia
go
away
,
she
be
in
such
a
passion
of
tear
that
they
be
oblige
to
send
for
Dr.
Floss
,
and
half
tipsify
her
with
salvolatile
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pinkerton
's
attachment
be
,
as
may
be
suppose
from
the
high
position
and
eminent
virtue
of
that
lady
,
calm
and
dignified
;
but
Miss
Jemima
have
already
whimper
several
time
at
the
idea
of
Amelia
's
departure
;
and
,
but
for
fear
of
her
sister
,
would
have
go
off
in
downright
hysteric
,
like
the
heiress
(
who
pay
double
)
of
St.
Kitt
's
.
 
<EOS>
such
luxury
of
grief
,
however
,
be
only
allow
to
parlour
-
boarder
.
<EOS>
honest
Jemima
have
all
the
bill
,
and
the
washing
,
and
the
mending
,
and
the
pudding
,
and
the
plate
and
crockery
,
and
the
servant
to
superintend
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
speak
about
her
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
we
shall
not
hear
of
her
again
from
this
moment
to
the
end
of
time
,
and
that
when
the
great
filigree
iron
gate
be
once
closed
on
her
,
she
and
her
awful
sister
will
never
issue
therefrom
into
this
little
world
of
history
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
we
be
to
see
a
great
deal
of
Amelia
,
there
be
no
harm
in
say
,
at
the
outset
of
our
acquaintance
,
that
she
be
a
dear
little
creature
;
and
a
great
mercy
it
be
,
both
in
life
and
in
novel
,
which
(
and
the
latter
especially
)
abound
in
villain
of
the
most
sombre
sort
,
that
we
be
to
have
for
a
constant
companion
so
guileless
and
good
-
natured
a
person
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
be
not
a
heroine
,
there
be
no
need
to
describe
her
person
;
indeed
I
be
afraid
that
her
nose
be
rather
short
than
otherwise
,
and
her
cheek
a
great
deal
too
round
and
red
for
a
heroine
;
but
her
face
blush
with
rosy
health
,
and
her
lip
with
the
fresh
of
smile
,
and
she
have
a
pair
of
eye
which
sparkle
with
the
bright
and
honestest
good
-
humour
,
except
indeed
when
they
fill
with
tear
,
and
that
be
a
great
deal
too
often
;
for
the
silly
thing
would
cry
over
a
dead
canary
-
bird
;
or
over
a
mouse
,
that
the
cat
haply
have
seize
upon
;
or
over
the
end
of
a
novel
,
be
it
ever
so
stupid
;
and
as
for
say
an
unkind
word
to
her
,
be
any
person
hard
-
hearted
enough
to
do
so
 
<EOS>
why
,
so
much
the
bad
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
even
Miss
Pinkerton
,
that
austere
and
godlike
woman
,
cease
scold
her
after
the
first
time
,
and
though
she
no
more
comprehended
sensibility
than
she
do
Algebra
,
give
all
master
and
teacher
particular
order
to
treat
Miss
Sedley
with
the
utmost
gentleness
,
as
harsh
treatment
be
injurious
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
so
that
when
the
day
of
departure
come
,
between
her
two
custom
of
laughing
and
cry
,
Miss
Sedley
be
greatly
puzzle
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
She
be
glad
to
go
home
,
and
yet
most
woefully
sad
at
leave
school
.
 
<EOS>
for
three
day
before
,
little
Laura
Martin
,
the
orphan
,
follow
her
about
like
a
little
dog
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
to
make
and
receive
at
least
fourteen
present
 
to
make
fourteen
solemn
promise
of
writing
every
week
:
"
send
my
letter
under
cover
to
my
grandpapa
,
the
Earl
of
Dexter
,
"
say
Miss
Saltire
(
who
,
by
the
way
,
be
rather
shabby
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
mind
the
postage
,
but
write
every
day
,
you
dear
darling
,
"
say
the
impetuous
and
woolly
-
headed
,
but
generous
and
affectionate
Miss
Swartz
;
and
the
orphan
little
Laura
Martin
(
who
be
just
in
round

,
take
her
friend

hand
and

look
up
in

face
wistfully

"
Amelia

I

to
you
I
shall
call
you
Mamma

<EOS>
"
all
which
detail
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
JONES
,
who
read
this
book
at
his
Club
,
will
pronounce
to
be
excessively
foolish
,
trivial
,
twaddle
,
and
ultra
-
sentimental
.
 
<EOS>
yes
;
I
can
see
Jones
at
this
minute
(
rather
flush
with
his
joint
of
mutton
and
half
pint
of
wine
)
,
take
out
his
pencil
and
score
under
the
word
"
foolish
,
twaddle
,
"
&
c.
,
and
add
to
them
his
own
remark
of
"
quite
true
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
he
be
a
lofty
man
of
genius
,
and
admire
the
great
and
heroic
in
life
and
novel

and
so
have
better
take
warning
and
go
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
the

by
the

with
a
correspond
sneer
 
the
hour
for
parting
come
;
and
the
grief
of
that
moment
be
considerably
lessen
by
the
admirable
discourse
which
Miss
Pinkerton
address
to
her
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
not

Amelia
to
philosophise

or
that
it
arm
her
in
any
way
with
a
calmness
,
the

of
argument

but
it
be
intolerably
dull

pompous
,

tedious
;
and
have
the
fear
of
her
schoolmistress
greatly
before
her

,
Miss
Sedley
do
not
venture
,
in
her
presence

to
give

Miss

Miss

be
almost
as
flurry

consider
,
it
be
but
one
minute

Nay

with
some
person
those
awe

terror

<EOS>
I
know
,
for
instance
,
an
old
gentleman
of
sixty

eight
,
who
say
to
me
one
morning
at
breakfast
,
with
a
very
agitated
countenance

"
<EOS>
I
dream
last
night
that
I

flog
by
Dr.
Raine

<EOS>
Fancy
have
carry
him
back
five

and
-
fifty
year

evening

<EOS>
Dr.
Raine
and
his
rod
be
just

awful

him
in

then
,
at
sixty

eight

as
they
have
be
at
thirteen

<EOS>
if
the
Doctor

with
a
large
birch

have
appear
bodily
to
him

even
at
the
age

threescore
and
eight

and
have
say
in
awful
voice

"
boy

take
down
your

<EOS>
well
,
well
,
Miss

alarm

insubordination

"
how
could
you
do
so

Rebecca

"
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
why

do
you
think
Miss
Pinkerton
will
come
out
and
order
me
back
to
the
black

say
Rebecca
,
laughing

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>

"
  
"
I
hate
the

Miss

in
a
fury
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
never
set
eye
on
it
again

<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
in
the
bottom
of
the
Thames

I
do
;
and
if
Miss
Pinkerton
be
there
,
I
would
not
pick
her
out
,
that
I
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
should
like
to
see
her
float
in
the
water
yonder
,
turban
and
all
,
with
her
train
streaming
after
her
,
and
her
nose
like
the
beak
of
a
wherry

"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
cry
Miss
Sedley

<EOS>
"
why

will
the
black
footman
tell
tale
?
"
cry
Miss
Rebecca
,
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
He
may
go
back
and
tell
Miss
Pinkerton
that
I
hate
her
with
all
my
soul
;
and
I
wish
he
would
;
and
I
wish
I
have
a
means
of
prove
it
,
too
.
<EOS>
for
two
year
I
have
only
have
insult
and
outrage
from
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
treat
bad
than
any
servant
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
have
a
friend
or
a
kind
word
,
except
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
make
to
tend
the
little
girl
in
the
low
schoolroom
,
and
to
talk
French
to
the
Misses
,
until
I
grow
sick
of
my
mother
tongue
.
<EOS>
but
that
talk
French
to
Miss
Pinkerton
be
capital
fun
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
a
word
of
French
,
and
be
too
proud
to
confess
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
that
which
make
her
part
with
me
;
and
so
thank
Heaven
for
French
.

Vive

"
  
<EOS>
"
o
Rebecca
,
Rebecca
,
for
shame

"
cry
Miss
Sedley
;
for
this
be
the
great
blasphemy
Rebecca
have
as
yet
utter
;
and
in
those
day
,
in
England
,
to
say
,
"
long
live
Bonaparte

<EOS>
"
be
as
much
as
to

"
long

Lucifer

"
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
 
how
dare
you
have
such
wicked

revengeful
thought

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
revenge
may
be
wicked

but
it
be
natural

answer
Miss
Rebecca
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
angel

"
<EOS>
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
she
certainly
be
not
.
  
<EOS>
for
it
may
be
remark
in
the
course
of
this
little
conversation
(
which
take
place
as
the
coach
roll
along
lazily
by
the
river
side
)
that
though
Miss
Rebecca
Sharp
have
twice
have
occasion
to
thank
Heaven
,
it
have
be
,
in
the
first
place
,
for
rid
her
of
some
person
whom
she
hate
,
and
secondly
,
for
enable
her
to
bring
her
enemy
to
some
sort
of
perplexity
or
confusion
;
neither
of
which
be
very
amiable
motive
for
religious
gratitude

or
such
as
would
be
put
forward
by
person
of
a
kind
and
placable
disposition

<EOS>
Miss
Rebecca
be
not
,
then
,
in
the
least
kind
or
placable
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
world
use
her
ill
,
say
this
young
misanthropist
,
and
we
may
be
pretty
certain
that
person
whom
all
the
world
treat
ill
,
deserve
entirely
the
treatment
they
get
.
 
<EOS>
the
world
be
a
looking

glass

and
give
back
to
every
man
the
reflection
of
his
own
face

<EOS>
Frown
at
it

and
it
will
in
turn
look
sourly
upon
you
;

at
it
<EOS>

with
it

it
be
a
jolly
kind
companion

so
let
all
young
person
take
their
choice
.
<EOS>
this
be
certain
,
that
if
the
world
neglect
Miss
Sharp
,
she
never
be
know
to
have
do
a
good
action
in

of
anybody

nor
can
it
be
expect
that
twenty

four
young
lady
should
all
be
as
amiable
as
the
heroine
of
this
work
,
Miss
Sedley
(
whom
we
have
select
for
the
very
reason
that
she
be
the
best

natured
of
all

otherwise
what
on

be

have
prevent
us
from
put
up
Miss
Swartz
,
or
Miss
Crump
,
or
Miss
Hopkins
,
as
heroine
in
her
place

<EOS>
it
could
not
be
expect
that
every
one
should
be
of
the
humble
and
gentle
temper
of
Miss
Amelia
Sedley
;
should
take
every
opportunity
to
vanquish
Rebecca
's
hard
-
heartedness
and
ill
-
humour
;
and
,
by
a
thousand
kind
word
and
office
,
overcome
,
for
once
at

,
her
hostility
to
her

<EOS>
Miss
Sharp
's
father
be
an
artist
,
and
in
that
quality
have
give
lesson
of
draw
at
Miss
Pinkerton
's
school
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
clever
man
;
a
pleasant
companion
;
a
careless
student
;
with
a
great
propensity
for
run
into
debt
,
and
a
partiality
for
the
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
drunk
,
he
use
to
beat
his
wife
and
daughter
;
and
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
with
a
headache
,
he
would
rail
at
the
world
for
its
neglect
of
his
genius
,
and
abuse
,
with
a
good
deal
of
cleverness
,
and
sometimes
with
perfect
reason
,
the
fool
,
his
brother
painter
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
he
could
keep
himself
,
and
as
he
owe
money
for
a
mile
round
Soho
,
where
he
live
,
he
think
to
better
his
circumstance
by
marry
a
young
woman
of
the
french
nation
,
who
be
by
profession
an
opera
-
girl
.
 
<EOS>
the
humble
calling
of
her
female
parent
Miss
Sharp
never
allude
to
,
but
use
to
state
subsequently
that
the
Entrechats
be
a
noble
family
of
Gascony
,
and
take
great
pride
in
her
descent
from
them
.
<EOS>
and
curious
it
be
that
as
she
advance
in
life
this
young
lady

ancestor
increase
in
rank
and
splendour
.
  
<EOS>
Rebecca

mother
have
have
some
education
somewhere
,
and
her
daughter
speak
French
with
purity
and
a
parisian
accent
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
those
day
rather
a
rare
accomplishment
,
and
lead
to
her
engagement
with
the
orthodox
Miss
Pinkerton
.
 
<EOS>
for
her
mother
be
dead
,
her
father
,
find
himself
not
likely
to
recover
,
after
his
third
attack
of
delirium
tremen
,
write
a
manly
and
pathetic
letter
to
Miss
Pinkerton
,
recommend
the
orphan
child
to
her
protection
,
and
so
descend
to
the
grave
,
after
two
bailiff
have
quarrel
over
his
corpse

<EOS>
Rebecca
be
seventeen

Chiswick

bind
over
as
an
articled
pupil

her
duty
be
to
talk
French
,
as
we
have
see
;
and
her
privilege
to
live
cost
free
,
and
,
with
a
few
guinea
a
year
,
to
gather
scrap
of
knowledge
from
the
professor
who
attend
the
school
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
small

slight
in
person
;
pale

sandy

haired
,
and
with
eye
habitually
cast
down
:
when
they
look
up
they
be
very
large
,
odd
,
and
attractive
;
so
attractive
that
the
Reverend
Mr.

,
fresh
from
Oxford
,
and
curate
to
the
Vicar
of
Chiswick
,
the
Reverend
Mr.

fall
in
love
with
Miss

be
shoot
dead
by
a
glance
of
her
eye
which
be
fire
all
the
way
across
Chiswick
Church
from
the
school

pew
to
the

<EOS>
this
infatuate
young
man
use
sometimes
to
take
tea
with
Miss
Pinkerton
,
to
whom
he
have
be
present
by
his
mamma
,
and
actually
propose
something
like
marriage
in
an
intercepted
note
,
which
the

charge
to
deliver

<EOS>
Mrs.
Crisp
be
summon
from
Buxton

abruptly
carry
off
her
darling

but
the
idea
,
even
,
of
such
an
eagle
in
the
Chiswick
dovecot
cause
a
great
flutter
in
the
breast
of
Miss
Pinkerton
,
who
would
have
send
away
Miss
Sharp
but
that
she
be
bind
to
her
under
a
forfeit

and
who
never

thoroughly
believe
the

protestation
that
she
have
never
exchange
a

word
with
Mr.
Crisp
,
except
under
her
own
eye
on
the
two
occasion
when
she
have
meet
him
at
tea
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
side
of
many
tall

bounce
young
lady
in
the
establishment
,
Rebecca
Sharp
look
like
a
child

<EOS>
but
she
have
the
dismal
precocity
of
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
dun
have
she
talk
to

and
turn
away
from

many
a

have
she
coax
and
wheedle
into
good

humour
,
and
into
the
granting
of
one
meal
more

<EOS>
She
sate
commonly
with
her
father
,
who
be
very
proud
of
her
wit

and
hear
the
talk
of
many
of
his
wild

often

ill

but
she

she
have
be
a

since
she

eight
year
old

<EOS>
oh

why
do
Miss
Pinkerton
let
such
a
dangerous
bird
into
her
cage

<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
the
old
lady
believe
Rebecca
to
be
the
meek
creature
in
the
world
,
so
admirably
,
on
the
occasion
when
her
father
bring
her
to
Chiswick
,
use
Rebecca
to
perform
the
part
of
the

and
only
a
year
before
the
arrangement
by
which
Rebecca
have
be

and
when
Rebecca
be
sixteen
year

Miss

make
her

(
it

the

dissolute

clever

jovial

she

after

the
catastrophe
come

to
the

<EOS>
the
rigid
formality

the
prayer

the
meal
,
the
lesson
and
the
walk
,
which
be
arrange
with
a
conventual
regularity
,
oppress
her
almost
beyond

she
look
back

the
freedom

the
beggary
of
the

in
Soho
with
so
much
regret

She

it

She

She

her
father

reprobate
as
he
be

be
a
man
of
talent
;
his
conversation
be
a
thousand
time
more
agreeable
to
her
than
the
talk
of
such
of
her
own
sex
as
she
now
encounter
.
<EOS>
the
pompous
vanity
of
the
old
schoolmistress
,
the
foolish
good

humour
of
her
sister

the
silly
chat
and
scandal
of
the

this

<EOS>
thus
the
world
begin
for
these
two
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
for
Amelia
it
be
quite
a
new
,
fresh
,
brilliant
world
,
with
all
the
bloom
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
quite
a
new
one
for
Rebecca
 
<EOS>
(
indeed
,
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
with
respect
to
the
Crisp
affair
,
the
tart
-
woman
hint
to
somebody
,
who
take
an
affidavit
of
the
fact
to
somebody
else
,
that
there
be
a
great
deal
more
than
be
make
public
regard
Mr.
Crisp
and
Miss
Sharp
,
and
that
his
letter
be
in
answer
to
another
letter
)
.
 
<EOS>
but
who
can
tell
you
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
?
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
if
Rebecca
be
not
begin
the
world
,
she
be
begin
it
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
the
young
lady
reach
Kensington
turnpike
,
Amelia
have
not
forget
her
companion
,
but
have
dry
her
tear
,
and
have
blush
very
much
and
be
delight
at
a
young
officer
of
the
Life
Guards
,
who
spy
her
as
he
be
ride
by
,
and
say
,
"
a
dem
fine
gal
,
egad
!
"
<EOS>
and
before
the
carriage
arrive
in
Russell
Square
,
a
great
deal
of
conversation
have
take
place
about
the
Drawing
-
room
,
and
whether
or
not
young
lady
wear
powder
as
well
as
hoop
when
present
,
and
whether
she
be
to
have
that
honour
:
to
the
Lord
Mayor
's
ball
she
know
she
be
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
at
length
home
be
reach
,
Miss
Amelia
Sedley
skip
out
on
Sambo
's
arm
,
as
happy
and
as
handsome
a
girl
as
any
in
the
whole
big
city
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
both
he
and
coachman
agree
on
this
point
,
and
so
do
her
father
and
mother
,
and
so
do
every
one
of
the
servant
in
the
house
,
as
they
stand
bob
,
and
curtseying
,
and
smile
,
in
the
hall
to
welcome
their
young
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
that
she
show
Rebecca
over
every
room
of
the
house
,
and
everything
in
every
one
of
her
drawer
;
and
her
book
,
and
her
piano
,
and
her
dress
,
and
all
her
necklace
,
brooch
,
lace
,
and
gimcrack
.
<EOS>
She
insist
upon
Rebecca
accept
the
white
cornelian
and
the
turquoise
ring
,
and
a
sweet
sprigged
muslin
,
which
be
too
small
for
her
now
,
though
it
would
fit
her
friend
to
a
nicety
;
and
she
determine
in
her
heart
to
ask
her
mother
's
permission
to
present
her
white
Cashmere
shawl
to
her
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Could
she
not
spare
it
?
<EOS>
and
have
not
her
brother
Joseph
just
bring
her
two
from
India
?
  
<EOS>
when
Rebecca
see
the
two
magnificent
Cashmere
shawl
which
Joseph
Sedley
have
bring
home
to
his
sister
,
she
say
,
with
perfect
truth
,
"
that
it
must
be
delightful
to
have
a
brother
,
"
and
easily
get
the
pity
of
the
tender
-
hearted
Amelia
for
be
alone
in
the
world
,
an
orphan
without
friend
or
kindre
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
alone
,
"
say
Amelia
;
<EOS>
"
you
know
,
Rebecca
,
I
shall
always
be
your
friend
,
and
love
you
as
a
sister
 
indeed
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
but
to
have
parent
,
as
you
have
 
kind
,
rich
,
affectionate
parent
,
who
give
you
everything
you
ask
for
;
and
their
love
,
which
be
more
precious
than
all
!
<EOS>
My
poor
papa
could
give
me
nothing
,
and
I
have
but
two
frock
in
all
the
world
!
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
have
a
brother
,
a
dear
brother
!
<EOS>
oh
,
how
you
must
love
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
do
not
you
love
him
?
<EOS>
you
,
who
say
you
love
everybody
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
of
course
,
I
do
 
<EOS>
only
 
"
  
"
only
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
Joseph
do
not
seem
to
care
much
whether
I
love
him
or
not
.
<EOS>
He
give
me
two
finger
to
shake
when
he
arrive
after
ten
year
'
absence
!
<EOS>
He
be
very
kind
and
good
,
but
he
scarcely
ever
speak
to
me
;
I
think
he
love
his
pipe
a
great
deal
well
than
his
"
 
<EOS>
but
here
Amelia
check
herself
,
for
why
should
she
speak
ill
of
her
brother
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
very
kind
to
me
as
a
child
,
"
she
add
;
"
I
be
but
five
year
old
when
he
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
he
very
rich
?
"
say
Rebecca
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
say
all
indian
nabob
be
enormously
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
have
a
very
large
income
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
your
sister
-
in
-
law
a
nice
pretty
woman
?
"
  
"
La
!
<EOS>
Joseph
be
not
married
,
"
say
Amelia
,
laugh
again
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
she
have
mention
the
fact
already
to
Rebecca
,
but
that
young
lady
do
not
appear
to
have
remember
it
;
indeed
,
vow
and
protest
that
she
expect
to
see
a
number
of
Amelia
's
nephews
and
niece
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
disappointed
that
Mr.
Sedley
be
not
married
;
she
be
sure
Amelia
have
say
he
be
,
and
she
dote
so
on
little
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
must
have
have
enough
of
them
at
Chiswick
,
"
say
Amelia
,
rather
wonder
at
the
sudden
tenderness
on
her
friend
's
part
;
and
indeed
in
later
day
Miss
Sharp
would
never
have
commit
herself
so
far
as
to
advance
opinion
,
the
untruth
of
which
would
have
be
so
easily
detect
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
must
remember
that
she
be
but
nineteen
as
yet
,
unused
to
the
art
of
deceiving
,
poor
innocent
creature
!
<EOS>
and
make
her
own
experience
in
her
own
person
.
 
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
the
above
series
of
query
,
as
translate
in
the
heart
of
this
ingenious
young
woman
,
be
simply
this
:
"
if
Mr.
Joseph
Sedley
be
rich
and
unmarried
,
why
should
I
not
marry
him
?
<EOS>
I
have
only
a
fortnight
,
to
be
sure
,
but
there
be
no
harm
in
try
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
determine
within
herself
to
make
this
laudable
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
She
redouble
her
caress
to
Amelia
;
she
kiss
the
white
cornelian
necklace
as
she
put
it
on
;
and
vow
she
would
never
,
never
part
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
dinner
-
bell
rang
<EOS>
she
go
downstairs
with
<EOS>
her
arm
round
her
friend
's
waist
,
as
be
the
habit
of
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
agitated
at
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
that
she
could
hardly
find
courage
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
"
feel
my
heart
,
how
it
beat
,
dear

"
<EOS>
say
she
to
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"

say
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
"

not

any
harm

and
blush
excessively
,
and
hide
his
entire

almost
in

at
this
apparition

"

<EOS>
She
have
previously

like
curtsey
to
the

and
her
modest
eye
gaze
so
perseveringly

carpet
that
it
be
a
wonder
how
she
should
have
find
an
opportunity

<EOS>
"

puff

"
I

<EOS>
if
Miss

Sharp
have
determine
in

upon
make
the
conquest
of
this
big
beau

I
do
not
think
,
lady

we
have
any
right
to
blame
her
;
for
though
the
task
of
husband
-
hunting
be
generally
,
and
with
become
modesty
,
entrust
by
young
person
to
their
mamma
,
recollect
that
Miss
Sharp
have
no
kind
parent
to
arrange
these
delicate
matter
for
her
,
and
that
if
she
do
not
get
a
husband
for
herself
,
there
be
no
one
else
in
the
wide
world
who
would
take
the
trouble
off
her
hand

<EOS>
what
cause
young
people
to
"
come
out

"
but
the
noble
ambition
of
matrimony
?
<EOS>
what
send
them
troop

place
?
<EOS>
what
keep
them
dance
till
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
through
a
whole
mortal
season

<EOS>
what
cause
them
to
labour
at
pianoforte
sonatas
,
and
to
learn
four
song
from
a
fashionable
master
at
a
guinea
a
lesson
,
and
to
play
the
harp
if
they
have
handsome
arm

neat
elbow
,
and
to
wear
Lincoln
Green
toxophilite
hat
and
feather
,
but
that
they
may
bring
down
some
"
desirable

young
man
with

<EOS>
what

topsy

turvy
,
and
spend
a
fifth
of
their

supper

<EOS>
be
it
sheer
love
of

an
unadulterated
wish
to
see
young

happy

<EOS>
Psha

they
want

beloved
but
unprotected
Rebecca
determine
to
do
her
very
good
to
secure
the
husband
,
who
be
even
more
necessary
for
her
than
for
her
friend

<EOS>
She
have
a
vivid
imagination
;
she
have
,
besides
,
read
the
Arabian
Nights
and
Guthrie
's
Geography
;
and
it
be
a
fact
that
while
she
be
dress
for
dinner
,
and
after
she
have
ask
Amelia
whether
her
brother
be
very
rich
,
she
have
build
for
herself
a
most
magnificent
castle
in
the
air
,
of
which
she
be
mistress
,
with
a
husband
somewhere
in
the
background
<EOS>
(
she
have
not
see
him
as
yet
,
and
his
figure
would
not
therefore
be
very
distinct
)
;
she
have
array
herself
in
an
infinity
of
shawl
,
turbans
,
and
diamond
necklace
,
and
have
mount
upon
an
elephant
to
the
sound
of
the
march
in
Bluebeard
,
in
order
to
pay
a
visit
of

to
the
Grand
Mogul

Charming
Alnaschar

<EOS>
it
be
the
happy
privilege
of
youth

and

<EOS>
Joseph
Sedley
be
twelve
year
old
than
his
sister
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
East
India
Company
's
Civil
Service
,
and
his
name
appear
,
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
,
in
the
Bengal
division
of
the
East
India
Register
,
as
collector
of
Boggley
Wollah
,
an
honourable
and
lucrative
post
,
as
everybody
know
:
in
order
to
know
to
what
high
post
<EOS>
Joseph
rise
in
the
service
,
the
reader
be
refer
to
the
same
periodical
.
  
<EOS>
Boggley
Wollah
be
situate
in
a
fine
,
lonely
,
marshy
,
jungly
district
,
famous
for
snipe
-
shooting
,
and
where
not
unfrequently
you
may
flush
a
tiger
.
 
<EOS>
Ramgunge
,
where
there
be
a
magistrate
,
be
only
forty
mile
off
,
and
there
be
a
cavalry
station
about
thirty
mile
farther
;
so
Joseph
write
home
to
his
parent
,
when
he
take
possession
of
his
collectorship
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
live
for
about
eight
year
of
his
life
,
quite
alone
,
at
this
charming
place
,
scarcely
see
a
christian
face
except
twice
a
year
,
when
the
detachment
arrive
to
carry
off
the
revenue
which
he
have
collect
,
to
Calcutta
.
  
<EOS>
luckily
,
at
this
time
he
catch
a
liver
complaint
,
for
the
cure
of
which
he
return
to
Europe
,
and
which
be
the
source
of
great
comfort
and
amusement
to
him
in
his
native
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
live
with
his
family
while
in
London
,
but
have
lodging
of
his
own
,
like
a
gay
young
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
go
to
India
he
be
too
young
to
partake
of
the
delightful
pleasure
of
a
man
about
town
,
and
plunge
into
them
on
his
return
with
considerable
assiduity
.
 
<EOS>
He
drive
his
horse
in
the
Park
;
he
dine
at
the
fashionable
tavern
(
for
the
Oriental
Club
be
not
as
yet
invent
)
;
he
frequent
the
theatre
,
as
the
mode
be
in
those
day
,
or
make
his
appearance
at
the
opera
,
laboriously
attire
in
tight
and
a
cocked
hat
.
  
<EOS>
on
return
to
India
,
and
ever
after
,
he
use
to
talk
of
the
pleasure
of
this
period
of
his
existence
with
great
enthusiasm
,
and
give
you
to
understand
that
he
and
Brummel
be
the
lead
buck
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
as
lonely
here
as
in
his
jungle
at
Boggley
Wollah
.
 
<EOS>
He
scarcely
know
a
single
soul
in
the
metropolis
:
and
be
it
not
for
his
doctor
,
and
the
society
of
his
blue
-
pill
,
and
his
liver
complaint
,
he
must
have
die
of
loneliness
.
<EOS>
He
be
lazy
,
peevish
,
and
a
bon
-
vivant
;
the
appearance
of
a
lady
frighten
him
beyond
measure
;
hence
it
be
but
seldom
that
he
join
the
paternal
circle
in
Russell
Square
,
where
there
be
plenty
of
gaiety
,
and
where
the
joke
of
his
good
-
natured
old
father
frighten
his
amour
-
propre
.
 
<EOS>
His
bulk
cause
Joseph
much
anxious
thought
and
alarm
;
now
and
then
he
would
make
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
rid
of
his
superabundant
fat
;
but
his
indolence
and
love
of
good
living
speedily
get
the
well
of
these
endeavour
at
reform
,
and
he
find
himself
again
at
his
three
meal
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
be
well
dressed
;
but
he
take
the
huge
pain
to
adorn
his
big
person
,
and
pass
many
hour
daily
in
that
occupation
.
<EOS>
His
valet
make
a
fortune
out
of
his
wardrobe
:
his
toilet
-
table
be
cover
with
as
many
pomatum
and
essence
as
ever
be
employ
by
an
old
beauty
:
he
have
try
,
in
order
to
give
himself
a
waist
,
every
girth
,
stay
,
and
waistband
then
invent
.
 
<EOS>
like
most
fat
man
,
he
would
have
his
clothe
make
too
tight
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
they
should
be
of
the
most
brilliant
colour
and
youthful
cut
.
 
<EOS>
when
dress
at
length
,
in
the
afternoon
,
he
would
issue
forth
to
take
a
drive
with
nobody
in
the
Park
;
and
then
would
come
back
in
order
to
dress
again
and
go
and
dine
with
nobody
at
the
Piazza
Coffee
-
House
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
vain
as
a
girl
;
and
perhaps
his
extreme
shyness
be
one
of
the
result
of
his
extreme
vanity
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Rebecca
can
get
the
well
of
him
,
and
at
her
first
entrance
into
life
,
she
be
a
young
person
of
no
ordinary
cleverness
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
move
show
considerable
skill
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
call
Sedley
a
very
handsome
man
,
she
know
that
Amelia
would
tell
her
mother
,
who
would
probably
tell
Joseph
,
or
who
,
at
any
rate
,
would
be
please
by
the
compliment
pay
to
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
all
mother
be
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
tell
Sycorax
that
her
son
Caliban
be
as
handsome
as
Apollo
,
she
would
have
be
please
,
witch
as
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
too
,
Joseph
Sedley
would
overhear
the
compliment
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
speak
loud
enough
 
and
he
do
hear
,
and
(
think
in
his
heart
that
he
be
a
very
fine
man
)
<EOS>
the
praise
thrill
through
every
fibre
of
his
big
body
,
and
make
it
tingle
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
however
,
come
a
recoil
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
the
girl
make
fun
of
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
think
,
and
straightway
he
bounce
towards
the
bell
,
and
be
for
retreat
,
as
we
have
see
,
when
his
father
's
joke
and
his
mother
's
entreaty
cause
him
to
pause
and
stay
where
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
conduct
the
young
lady
down
to
dinner
in
a
dubious
and
agitated
frame
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
she
really
think
I
be
handsome
?
"
<EOS>
think
he
,
"
or
be
she
only
make
game
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
We
have
talk
of
Joseph
Sedley
be
as
vain
as
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
help
us
!
<EOS>
the
girl
have
only
to
turn
the
table
,
and
say
of
one
of
their
own
sex
,
"
She
be
as
vain
as
a
man
,
"
and
they
will
have
perfect
reason
.
 
<EOS>
the
bearded
creature
be
quite
as
eager
for
praise
,
quite
as
finikin
over
their
toilette
,
quite
as
proud
of
their
personal
advantage
,
quite
as
conscious
of
their
power
of
fascination
,
as
any
coquette
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
downstairs
,
then
,
they
go
,
Joseph
very
red
and
blushing
,
Rebecca
very
modest
,
and
hold
her
green

<EOS>
She

bare
shoulder
as
white

<EOS>
the
picture
of
youth

unprotected
innocence

and
humble
virgin
simplicity
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
very
quiet

"
think
Rebecca
,
"
and
very
much
interested
about
India

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
They
think
poor

too
much

<EOS>
She
would
have
like
to
choke
old
Sedley
,
but
she
swallow
her
mortification
as
well
as
she
have
the
abominable
curry
before
it
,
and
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
say
,
with
a
comical
,
good

humoured
air
,
"
I
ought

no

then
she
give
him
ever
so
gentle
a
pressure
with
her
little
hand

draw
it
back
quite
frightened
,

look
first
for
one
instant

then
down
at

I
be
not

Joe

do
not
thump

little
involuntary

timid

gentle
motion
of
regard
on
the

the
simple

<EOS>
It
be
an
advance
,
and
as
such
,
perhaps
,
some
lady
of
indisputable
correctness

gentility
will
condemn
the
action
as
immodest
;
but
,
you
see
,
poor

Rebecca
have
all
this
work
to
do
for
herself

<EOS>
if
a
person
be
too
poor
to
keep
a
servant
,
though
ever
so
elegant

he
must
sweep
his
own
room
:
if
a
dear

have
no
dear
Mamma
to
settle
matter
with
the
young
man

she
must
do
it
for
herself

oh

what

it

it

all

this
I

down

a

George

to
kiss
her
in
the
face
of
the

if
I
should
say
that
they
fall
in
love
with
each
other
at
that
single
instant
of
time
,
I
should
perhaps
be
tell
an
untruth

<EOS>
for
the
fact
be
that
these
two
young

have
be
breed
up
by

put
her

into
Mr.

<EOS>
when
two

a
great

of
confidence

intimacy

presently
establish

<EOS>
there
be
no
need
of
give
a
special
report
of
the
conversation
which
now
take
place
between
Mr.

the
young

;
for
the
conversation
,
as
may
be
judge
from
the
forego
speciman

be
not
especially
witty

eloquent
;
it
seldom

or
anywhere

in

without
the

timidity
or
hesitation

<EOS>
Miss

ask
him
a
great
number
of
question
about
India
,
which
give
him
an
opportunity
of
narrate
many
interesting
anecdote
about

country
and
himself

He

It

She

<EOS>
Joseph
Sedley
,
who
be
fond
of
music
,
and
soft

hearted
,
be
in
a
state
of
ravishment
during
the
performance
of

<EOS>
if

if
George

have

accord
to
the
former

in

Joseph
Sedley

have
be
at

this

<EOS>
but
at
the
close
of
the

Rebecca
quit
the

and
give
her
hand
to
Amelia

walk
away

at

<EOS>
when
the

they
find
the
young

so
busy
in

that
they
have
not

arrival
of

and
Mr.

be
in
the
act
of
say
,
"
My

Mr.

on
hear
the
bantering
of
which
well

know
voice
,
Jos
instantly
relapse
into
an
alarmed
silence
,
and
quickly
take
his
departure

<EOS>
He
do
not
lie
awake
all
night
think
whether

not
he
be
in

with
Miss
Sharp
;
the
passion
of
love
never
interfere
with
the
appetite
or
the
slumber
of
Mr.
Joseph
Sedley
;
but
he
think
to
himself
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
hear
such
song
as
those
after
Cutcherry
 
what
a
distinguee
girl
<EOS>
she
be
 
how
she
could
speak
French
better
than
the
Governor

General
's
lady
herself
 
and
what
a
sensation
she
would
make
at
the
Calcutta
ball
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
evident
<EOS>
the
poor
devil
's
in
love
with
me
,
"
think
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
just
as
rich
as
most
of
the
girl
who
come
out
to
India
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
go
farther
,
and
fare
worse

"
<EOS>
and
in
these
meditation
he
fall
asleep

<EOS>
how
Miss
Sharp
lie
awake
,
think
,
will
he
come
or
not
to

<EOS>
need
not
be
tell
here

<EOS>
To

come

,
as
sure
as
fate
,
Mr.
Joseph
Sedley
make
his
appearance
before
luncheon

<EOS>
He
have
never

know
before
to
confer
such
an
honour
on
Russell

<EOS>
George
Osborne

somehow
there
already
(
sadly

Amelia

her

<EOS>
as
Joe

while

after
his

smile
archly

look
at
Rebecca

who
actually
blush
as

bend
her
fair

<EOS>
how

Joseph

<EOS>
It
be
a
nervous
moment
for
all
;
and
as
for
Amelia

I
think
she
be
more
frightened
than
even
the
people
most
concerned

<EOS>
Sambo
,
who
fling
open
the
door
and
announce
Mr.

in

bear
two
handsome

which
the

have
actually
have
the
gallantry
to

in
Covent

<EOS>
that

they
be
not

the
haystack
which
lady
carry
about
with

now
-
a

day
,
in
cone
of
filigree
paper
;
but
the
young

be
delight
with
the
gift
,
as
Joseph

Amelia

quite
ready
to

her

,
if
he
be
so
minded
.
 
<EOS>
(
and
I
think
for
a
kiss
from
such
a
dear
creature
as
Amelia

I
would
purchase
all
Mr.

conservatory
out

<EOS>
"

"
exclaim
Miss
Sharp
,
and
smell
them
delicately
,
and
hold
them
to
her
bosom
,
and
cast
up
her
eye
to
the
ceiling
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
she
just
look
first
into
the
bouquet
,
to
see
whether
there
be
a
billet
-
doux
hide
among
the
flower
;
but
there
be
no

<EOS>
"
do
they
talk

<EOS>
ask
Osborne

laughing

<EOS>
"

the

<EOS>
Rebecca
say
she
have
never
taste
a
pine
,
and
long
beyond
everything
to
taste
one

<EOS>
so
the
conversation
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
on
what
pretext
Osborne
leave
the
room
,
or
why
,
presently
,
Amelia
go
away

perhaps
to

but
Jos

alone

the

roar
out
Dobbin
,
spring
to
a
leaden

and
look
so
wicked
,
that
Mr.
Cuff
pause
,
turn
down
his
coat
sleeve
again
,
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,

walk
away
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
never
meddle
personally
with
the
grocer
's
boy
after
that
;
though
we
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
he
always
speak
of
Mr.
Dobbin
with
contempt
behind
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
after
this
interview
,
it
happen
that
Mr.
Cuff
,
on
a
sunshiny
afternoon
,
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
poor
William
Dobbin
,
who
be
lie
under
a
tree
in
the
playground
,
spell
over
a
favourite
copy
of
the
Arabian
Nights
which
he
have
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
school
,
who
be
pursue
their
various
sport
 
quite
lonely
,
and
almost
happy
.
 
<EOS>
if
people
would
but
leave
child
to
themselves
;
if
teacher
would
cease
to
bully
them
;
if
parent
would
not
insist
upon
direct
their
thought
,
and
dominate
their
feeling
 
those
feeling
and
thought
which
be
a
mystery
to
all
(
for
how
much
do
you
and
I
know
of
each
other
,
of
our
child
,
of
our
father
,
of
our
neighbour
,
and
how
far
more
beautiful
and
sacred
be
the
thought
of
the
poor
lad
or
girl
whom
you
govern
likely
to
be
,
than
those
of
the
dull
and
world
-
corrupt
person
who
rule

<EOS>
if
,
I
say
,
parent
and
master
would
leave
their
child
alone
a
little
more
,
small
harm
would
accrue
,
although
a
less
quantity
of
as
in
praesenti
may
be
acquire
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
William
Dobbin
have
for
once
forget
the
world
,
and
be
away
with
Sindbad
the
Sailor
in
the
Valley
of
Diamonds
,
or
with
Prince
Ahmed
and
the
Fairy
Peribanou
in
that
delightful
cavern
where
the
Prince
find
her
,
and
whither
we
should
all
like
to
make
a
tour
;
when
shrill
cries
,
as
of
a
little
fellow
weeping
,
wake
up
his
pleasant
reverie
;
and
look
up
,
he
see
Cuff
before
him
,
belabour
a
little
boy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
lad
who
have
peach
upon
him
about
the
grocer
's
cart
;
but
he
bear
little
malice
,
not
at
least
towards
the
young
and
small
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
dare
you
,
sir
,
break
the
bottle
?
"
say
Cuff
to
the
little
urchin
,
swinge
a
yellow
cricket
-
stump
over
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
boy
have
be
instruct
to
get
over
the
playground
wall
(
at
a
select
spot
where
the
break
glass
have
be
remove
from
the
top
,
and
niche
make
convenient
in
the
brick
)
;
to
run
a
quarter
of
a
mile
;
to
purchase
a
pint
of
rum
-
shrub
on
credit
;
to
brave
all
the
Doctor
's
outlying
spy
,
and
to
clamber
back
into
the
playground
again
;
during
the
performance
of
which
feat
,
his
foot
have
slipt
,
and
the
bottle
be
break
,
and
the
shrub
have
be
spilt
,
and
his
pantaloon
have
be
damage
,
and
he
appear
before
his
employer
a
perfectly
guilty
and
trembling
,
though
harmless
,
wretch
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
,
sir
,
break
it
?
"
<EOS>
say
Cuff
;
<EOS>
"
you
blunder
little
thief
.
<EOS>
You
drink
the
shrub
,
and
now
you
pretend
to
have
break
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
hold
out
your
hand
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Down
come
the
stump
with
a
great
heavy
thump
on
the
child
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
a
moan
follow
.
 
<EOS>
Dobbin
look
up
.
<EOS>
the
Fairy
Peribanou
have
flee
into
the
inmost
cavern
with
Prince
Ahmed
:
the
Roc
have
whisk
away
Sindbad
the
Sailor
out
of
the
Valley
of
diamond
out
of
sight
,
far
into
the
cloud
:
and
there
be
everyday
life
before
honest
William
;
and
a
big
boy
beat
a
little
one
without
cause
.
  
<EOS>
"
hold
out
your
other
hand
,
sir
,
"
roar
Cuff
to
his
little
schoolfellow
,
whose
face
be
distort
with
pain
.
<EOS>
Dobbin
quiver
,
and
gather
himself
up
in
his
narrow
old
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
that
,
you
little
devil
!
"
cry
Mr.
Cuff
,
and
down
come
the
wicket
again
on
the
child
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
horrify
,
lady
,
<EOS>
every
boy
at
a
public
school
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
Your
child
will
so
do
and
be
do
by
,
in
all
probability
.
 
<EOS>
Down
come
the
wicket
again
;
and
Dobbin
start
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
what
his
motive
be
.
 
<EOS>
torture
in
a
public
school
be
as
much
license
as
the
knout
in
Russia
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
ungentlemanlike
(
in
a
manner
)
to
resist
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Dobbin
's
foolish
soul
revolt
against
that
exercise
of
tyranny
;
or
perhaps
he
have
a
hankering
feeling
of
revenge
in
his
mind
,
and
long
to
measure
himself
against
that
splendid
bully
and
tyrant
,
who
have
all
the
glory
,
pride
,
pomp
,
circumstance
,
banner
fly
,
drum
beat
,
guard
salute
,
in
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
may
have
be
his
incentive
,
however
,
up
he
spring
,
and
scream
out
,
"
hold
off
,
Cuff
;
do
not
bully
that
child
any
more
;
or
I
will
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
or
you
will
what
?
"
<EOS>
Cuff
ask
in
amazement
at
this
interruption
.
"
<EOS>
hold
out
your
hand
,
you
little
beast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
the
bad
thrashing
you
ever
have
in
your
life
,
"
Dobbin
say
,
in
reply
to
the
first
part
of
Cuff
's
sentence
;
and
little
osborne
,
gasping
and
in
tear
,
look
up
with
wonder
and
incredulity
at
see
this
amazing
champion
put
up
suddenly
to
defend
him
:
while
Cuff
's
astonishment
be
scarcely
less
.
 
<EOS>
Fancy
our
late
monarch
George
III
when
he
hear
of
the
revolt
of
the
north
american
colony
<EOS>
:
fancy
brazen
Goliath
when
little
David
step
forward
and
claim
a
meeting
;
and
you
have
the
feeling
of
Mr.
Reginald
Cuff
when
this
rencontre
be
propose
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
school
,
"
say
he
,
of
course
;
after
a
pause
and
a
look
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
make
your
will
,
and
communicate
your
last
wish
to
your
friend
between
this
time
and
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
as
you
please
,
"
Dobbin
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
my
bottle
holder
,
Osborne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
if
you
like
,
"
little
osborne
reply
;
for
you
see
his
papa
keep
a
carriage
,
and
he
be
rather
ashamed
of
his
champion
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
when
the
hour
of
battle
come
,
he
be
almost
ashamed
to
say
,
"
go
it
,
figs
"
;
and
not
a
single
other
boy
in
the
place
utter
that
cry
for
the
first
two
or
three
round
of
this
famous
combat
;
at
the
commencement
of
which
the
scientific
Cuff
,
with
a
contemptuous
smile
on
his
face
,
and
as
light
and
as
gay
as
if
he
be
at
a
ball
,
plant
his
blow
upon
his
adversary
,
and
floor
that
unlucky
champion
three
time
run
.
 
<EOS>
at
each
fall
there
be
a
cheer
;
and
everybody
be
anxious
to
have
the
honour
of
offer
the
conqueror
a
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
lick
I
shall
get
when
it
be
over
,
"
young
osborne
think
,
pick
up
his
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
best
give
in
,
"
he
say
to
Dobbin
;
"
it
be
only
a
thrashing
,
Figs
,
and
you
know
I
be
used
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
fig
,
all
whose
limb
be
in
a
quiver
,
and
whose
nostril
be
breathe
rage
,
put
his
little
bottle
-
holder
aside
,
and
go
in
for
a
fourth
time
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
do
not
in
the
least
know
how
to
parry
the
blow
that
be
aim
at
himself
,
and
Cuff
have
begin
the
attack
on
the
three
precede
occasion
,
without
ever
allow
his
enemy
to
strike
,
Figs
now
determine
that
he
would
commence
the
engagement
by
a
charge
on
his
own
part
;
and
accordingly
,
be
a
left
-
handed
man
,
bring
that
arm
into
action
,
and
hit
out
a
couple
of
time
with
all
his
might
 
once
at
Mr.
Cuff
's
left
eye
,
and
once
on
his
beautiful
roman
nose
.
  
<EOS>
Cuff
go
down
this
time
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
assembly
.
<EOS>
"
well
hit
,
by
Jove
,
"
say
little
Osborne
,
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
,
clap
his
man
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
give
it
him
with
the
left
,
figs
my
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Figs
's
left
make
terrific
play
during
all
the
rest
of
the
combat
.
<EOS>
Cuff
go
down
every
time
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
sixth
round
,
there
be
almost
as
many
fellow
shout
out
,
"
go
it
,
fig
,
"
as
there
be
youth
exclaim
,
"
go
it
,
Cuff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
the
twelfth
round
the
latter
champion
be
all
abroad
,
as
the
saying
be
,
and
have
lose
all
presence
of
mind
and
power
of
attack
or
defence
.
 
<EOS>
fig
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
as
calm
as
a
quaker
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
be
quite
pale
,
his
eye
shine
open
,
and
a
great
cut
on
his
underlip
bleed
profusely
,
give
this
young
fellow
a
fierce
and
ghastly
air
,
which
perhaps
strike
terror
into
many
spectator
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
his
intrepid
adversary
prepare
to
close
for
the
thirteenth
time
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
the
pen
of
a
Napier
,
or
a
Bell
's
life
,
I
should
like
to
describe
this
combat
properly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
charge
of
the
Guard
 
(
that
is
,
it
would
have
be
,
only
Waterloo
have
not
yet
take
place
)
 
<EOS>
it
be
Ney
's
column
breast
the
hill
of
La
Haye
Sainte
,
bristle
with
ten
thousand
bayonet
,
and
crown
with
twenty
eagle
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
shout
of
the
beef
-
eat
British
,
as
leap
down
the
hill
they
rush
to
hug
the
enemy
in
the
savage
arm
of
battle
 
in
other
word
<EOS>
,
Cuff
come
up
full
of
pluck
,
but
quite
reel
and
groggy
,
<EOS>
the
Fig
-
merchant
put
in
his
left
as
usual
on
his
adversary
's
nose
,
and
send
him
down
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
will
do
for
him
,
"
fig
say
,
as
his
opponent
drop
as
neatly
on
the
green
as
I
have
see
Jack
Spot
's
ball
plump
into
the
pocket
at
billiard
;
and
the
fact
be
,
when
time
be
call
,
Mr.
Reginald
Cuff
be
not
able
,
or
do
not
choose
,
to
stand
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
all
the
boy
set
up
such
a
shout
for
fig
as
would
have
make
you
think
he
have
be
their
darle
champion
through
the
whole
battle
;
and
as
absolutely
bring
Dr.
Swishtail
out
of
his
study
,
curious
to
know
the
cause
of
the
uproar
.
 
<EOS>
He
threaten
to
flog
fig
violently
,
of
course
;
but
Cuff
,
who
have
come
to
himself
by
this
time
,
and
be
wash
his
wound
,
stand
up
and
say
,
"
It
be
my
fault
,
sir
 
not
Figs

not
Dobbin
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
bully
a
little
boy
;
and
he
serve
me
right
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
which
magnanimous
speech
<EOS>
he
not
only
save
his
conqueror
a
whipping
,
but
get
back
all
his
ascendancy
over
the
boy
which
his
defeat
have
nearly
cost
him

"

it

<EOS>
It
be
vote
low
to
sneer
at
Dobbin
about
this
accident
of
birth
.
<EOS>
"
Old

of

endearment
;
and
the

<EOS>
He
make
wonderful

<EOS>
the

carry

into
the

sized
form
;
and
even
there
get
a
fair
place
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
discover
,
that
although
dull

at

be
uncommonly
quick

to

<EOS>
You
should
have
see
his

face
when
Telemaque

be
present
to
him
by
the
Doctor

<EOS>
all
the

clap

in

<EOS>
His

and
the
number
of
foot
which
he
crush
as
he
go
back
to
his

,
who
shall
describe
or
calculate
?
<EOS>
Old
Dobbin
,
his
father
,
who
now
respect
him
for
the
first

give
him
two
guinea

<EOS>
most
of
which

a
general
tuck

out
for
the
school

and
he
come
back
in
a
tail

coat
after
the
holiday
.
  
<EOS>
Dobbin
be
much
too
modest
a
young
fellow
to
suppose
that
this
happy
change
in
all
his
circumstance
arise
from
his
own
generous
and
manly
disposition
:
he
choose
,
from
some
perverseness
,
to
attribute
his
good
fortune
to
the
sole
agency
and
benevolence
of
little
George
Osborne
,
to
whom
henceforth
he
vow
such
a
love
and
affection
as
be
only
feel
by

<EOS>
such
an

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
even
before

admire
Osborne
in
secret

<EOS>
now
he
be
his
valet
,
his

his

<EOS>
He
believe
Osborne
to
be
the
possessor
of
every
perfection
,
to
be
the
handsome
,
the
brave
,
the
most
active

He

Mrs.

say
:
at

speech
Miss

only
make
a
smile
and
a
blush
;
and
look
at
Mr.
George
Osborne
's
pale
interesting
countenance
,
and
those
beautiful
black
,
curling
,
shine
whisker
,
which
the
young
gentleman
himself
regard
with
no
ordinary
complacency
,
she
think
in
her
little
heart
that
in
His
Majesty
's
army
,
or
in
the
wide
world
,
there
never
be
such
a
face
or
such
a

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
about
Captain
Dobbin

"
she
say
,
"
or
about
his
awkwardness

<EOS>
I
shall
always
like
him
<EOS>
,
I
know
,
"
her
little
reason
be
,
that
he
be
the
friend
and
champion
of
George

<EOS>
"
there
be
not

osborne
say
,
"
nor
a
well
officer

though
he
be
not
an
Adonis

certainly
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
look
towards
the
glass
himself
with
much
naivete
;
and
in
so
do
,
catch
Miss
Sharp
's
eye
fix
keenly
upon
him
,
at
which
he
blush
a
little
,
and
Rebecca
think
in
her
heart

"

<EOS>
I
think
I

<EOS>
that
evening
,
when
Amelia
come
trip
into
the
drawing

room
in
a
white
muslin
frock
,
prepare
for
conquest
at
Vauxhall
,
singe
like
a
lark
,
and
as
fresh
as
a
rose
 
a
very
tall
ungainly
gentleman
,
with
large
hand
and
foot
,
and
large
ear
,
set
off
by
a
closely
crop
head
of
black
hair
,
and
in
the
hideous
military
frog
coat
and
cock
hat
of
those
time
,
advance
to
meet
her
,
and
make
her
one
of
the
clumsy
bow
that
be
ever
perform
by
a
mortal
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
Captain
William
Dobbin
,
of
His
Majesty
's
Regiment
of
Foot
,
return
from
yellow
fever
,
in
the
West
Indies

to
which
the
fortune
of
the
service
have
order
his
regiment
,
whilst
so
many
of
his
gallant
comrade
be
reap
glory
in
the
Peninsula
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
arrive
with
a
knock
so
very
timid
and
quiet
that
it
be
inaudible
to
the
lady
upstairs
:
<EOS>
otherwise
,
you
may
be
sure
Miss
Amelia
would
never
have
be
so
bold
as
to
come
singe
into
the
room

<EOS>
as
it
be
,
the
sweet
fresh
little
voice
go
right
into
the
Captain

heart
,
and
nestle
there
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
hold
out
her
hand
for
him
to
shake
,
before
he
envelop
it
in
his
own

he
pause
,
and
think
 
"
well

it
possible
 
be

<EOS>
what

you
seem

and
what
a
prize
the
rogue

get

"
<EOS>
all
this
he
think
,
before
he
take
Amelia
's
hand
into
his
own

and
as
he
let
his
cocked
hat
fall
.
  
<EOS>
His
history
since
he
leave

until
the
very
moment
when
we
have
the
pleasure
of
meet
him
again
,
although
not
fully
narrate
,
have
yet
,
I
think
,
be
indicate
sufficiently
for
an
ingenious
reader
by
the
conversation
in

<EOS>
Dobbin
,
the

<EOS>
Colonel

be
but
an
indifferent

,
have
be

and
the

<EOS>
His

have
enter

and
young
Osborne
follow
presently
in
the

<EOS>
They
have
serve
in
the
West
Indies
and
in
Canada

<EOS>
Their
regiment
have
just
come
home

the
attachment
of
Dobbin
to
George
Osborne
be
as
warm
and
generous
now
as
it
have
be
when
the
two
be
schoolboy

<EOS>
so
these
worthy
people
sit
down
to
dinner
presently
.
<EOS>
They
talk
about
war
and
glory
,

Boney
and
Lord
Wellington

and
the
last
Gazette

<EOS>
in
those
famous
day
every

have
a
victory
in
it

and
the
two
gallant
young
man
long
to
see
their
own
name
in
the
glorious
list
,
and
curse
their
unlucky
fate

have
be
away
from

<EOS>
Miss
Sharp
kindle
with
this
exciting
talk
,
but
Miss
Sedley
tremble
and
grow
quite
faint
as
she
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jos
tell
several
of
his

hunt
story
,
finish
the
one
about
Miss
Cutler
and
Lance

surgeon
;
help
Rebecca
to
everything
on

and
himself
gobble
and
drink
a
great
deal
.
  
<EOS>
He
spring
to
open
the
door
for
the
lady
,
when
they
retire
,
with
the
most
killing
grace
 
and
come
back
to
the
table
,
fill
himself
bumper
after
bumper

which
he
swallow

"
osborne
whisper
to
Dobbin
,
and
at
length
the
hour
<EOS>
and
the
carriage
arrive
for
Vauxhall
.
   
<EOS>
Vauxhall
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
tune
I
be
pipe
be
a
very
mild
one
(
although
there
be
some
terrific
chapter
come
presently
)
,
and
must
beg
the
good
-
natured
reader
to
remember
that
we
be
only
discourse
at
present
about
a
stockbroker
's
family
in
Russell
Square
,
who
be
take
walk
,
or
luncheon
,
or
dinner
,
or
talk
and
make
love
as
people
do
in
common
life
,
and
without
a
single
passionate
and
wonderful
incident
to
mark
the
progress
of
their
love
.
 
<EOS>
the
argument
stand
thus
 
Osborne
,
in
love
with
Amelia
,
have
ask
an
old
friend
to
dinner
and
to
Vauxhall
 
Jos
Sedley
be
in
love
with
Rebecca
.
 
<EOS>
Will
he
marry
her
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
great
subject
now
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
We
may
have
treat
this
subject
in
the
genteel
,
or
in
the
romantic
,
or
in
the
facetious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
suppose
we
have
lay
the
scene
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
with
the
very
same
adventure
 
would
not
some
people
have
listen
?
<EOS>
suppose
we
have
show
how
Lord
Joseph
Sedley
fall
in
love
,
and
the
Marquis
of
Osborne
become
attach
to
Lady
Amelia
,
with
the
full
consent
of
the
Duke
,
her
noble
father
:
or
instead
of
the
supremely
genteel
,
suppose
we
have
resort
to
the
entirely
low
,
and
describe
what
be
go
on
in
Mr.
Sedley
's
kitchen
 
<EOS>
how
black
Sambo
be
in
love
with
the
cook
(
as
indeed
he
be
)
,
and
how
he
fight
a
battle
with
the
coachman
in
her
behalf
;
how
the
knife
-
boy
be
catch
steal
a
cold
shoulder
of
mutton
,
and
Miss
Sedley
's
new
femme
de
chambre
refuse
to
go
to
bed
without
a
wax
candle
;
such
incident
may
be
make
to
provoke
much
delightful
laughter
,
and
be
suppose
to
represent
scene
of
"
life
.
<EOS>
"
or
if
,
on
the
contrary
,
we
have
take
a
fancy
for
the
terrible
,
and
make
the
lover
of
the
new
femme
de
chambre
a
professional
burglar
,
who
burst
into
the
house
with
his
band
,
slaughter
black
Sambo
at
the
foot
of
his
master

carry
off
Amelia

her
night

dress

,
we
should
easily
have
construct
a
tale
of
thrilling
interest
,
through
the
fiery
chapter
of
which
the
reader
should
hurry
,
pant
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
reader
must
hope
for
no
such
romance
,
only
a
homely
story
,
and
must
be
content
with
a
chapter
about
Vauxhall
,
which
be
so
short
that
it
scarce
deserve
to
be
call
a
chapter
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
a
chapter
,
and
a
very
important
one
too
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
there
little
chapter
in
everybody
's
life
,
that
seem
to
be
nothing
,
and
yet
affect
all
the
rest
of
the
history
?
  
<EOS>
let
us
then
step
into
the
coach
with
the
Russell
Square
party
,
and
be
off
to
the
Gardens
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
barely
room
between
Jos
and
Miss
Sharp
,
who
be
on
the
front
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Osborne
sit
bodkin
opposite
,
between
Captain
Dobbin
and
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
every
soul
in
the
coach
agree
that
on
that
night
Jos
would
propose
to
make
Rebecca
Sharp
Mrs.
Sedley
.
 
<EOS>
the
parent
at
home
have
acquiesce
in
the
arrangement
,
though
,
between
ourselves
,
old
Mr.
Sedley
have
a
feeling
very
much
akin
to
contempt
for
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
vain
,
selfish
,
lazy
,
and
effeminate
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
endure
his
air
as
a
man
of
fashion
,
and
laugh
heartily
at
his
pompous
braggadocio
story
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
leave
the
fellow
half
my
property
,
"
he
say
;
"
and
he
will
have
,
besides
,
plenty
of
his
own
;
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
perfectly
sure
that
if
you
,
and
I
,
and
his
sister
be
to
die
to
-
morrow
,
he
would
say
"
Good
Gad
!
"
and
eat
his
dinner
just
as
well
as
usual
,
I
be
not
go
to
make
myself
anxious
about
him
.
<EOS>
let
him
marry
whom
he
like
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
affair
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
on
the
other
hand
,
as
become
a
young
woman
of
her
prudence
and
temperament
,
be
quite
enthusiastic
for
the
match
.
 
<EOS>
once
or
twice
Jos
have
be
on
the
point
of
say
something
very
important
to
her
,
to
which
she
be
most
willing
to
lend
an
ear
,
but
the
fat
fellow
could
not
be
bring
to
unbosom
himself
of
his
great
secret
,
and
very
much
to
his
sister
's
disappointment
<EOS>
he
only
rid
himself
of
a
large
sigh
and
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
this
mystery
serve
to
keep
Amelia
's
gentle
bosom
in
a
perpetual
flutter
of
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
do
not
speak
with
Rebecca
on
the
tender
subject
,
she
compensate
herself
with
long
and
intimate
conversation
with
Mrs.
Blenkinsop
,
the
housekeeper
,
who
drop
some
hint
to
the
lady's
-
maid
,
who
may
have
cursorily
mention
the
matter
to
the
cook
,
who
carry
the
news
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
all
the
tradesman
,
so
that
Mr.
Jos
's
marriage
be
now
talk
of
by
a
very
considerable
number
of
person
in
the
Russell
Square
world
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
of
course
,
Mrs.
Sedley
's
opinion
that
her
son
would
demean
himself
by
a
marriage
with
an
artist
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
lor
'
,
madam
,
"
ejaculate
Mrs.
Blenkinsop
,
"
we
be
only
grocer
when
we
marry
Mr.
S.
,
who
be
a
stock
-
broker
's
clerk
,
and
we
have
not
five
hundred
pound
among
us
,
and
we
be
rich
enough
now
.
"
<EOS>
and
Amelia
be
entirely
of
this
opinion
,
to
which
,
gradually
,
the
good
-
natured
Mrs.
Sedley
be
bring
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sedley
be
neutral
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
Jos
marry
whom
he
like
,
"
he
say
;
"
it
be
no
affair
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
this
girl
have
no
fortune
;
no
more
have
Mrs.
Sedley
.
<EOS>
She
seem
good
-
humoured
and
clever
,
and
will
keep
him
in
order
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
better
she
,
my
dear
,
than
a
black
Mrs.
Sedley
,
and
a
dozen
of
mahogany
grandchild
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
that
everything
seem
to
smile
upon
Rebecca
's
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
Jos
's
arm
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
on
go
to
dinner
;
she
have
sate
by
him
on
the
box
of
his
open
carriage
(
a
most
tremendous
"
buck
"
<EOS>
he
be
,
as
he
sit
there
,
serene
,
in
state
,
drive
his
grey
)
,
and
though
nobody
say
a
word
on
the
subject
of
the
marriage
,
everybody
seem
to
understand
it
.
 
<EOS>
all
she
want
be
the
proposal
,
and
ah
!
<EOS>
how
Rebecca
now
feel
the
want
of
a
mother
!
 
<EOS>
a
dear
,
tender
mother
,
who
would
have
manage
the
business
in
ten
minute
,
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
little
delicate
confidential
conversation
,
would
have
extract
the
interesting
avowal
from
the
bashful
lip
of
the
young
man
!
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
state
of
affair
as
the
carriage
cross
Westminster
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
be
land
at
the
Royal
Gardens
in
due
time
.
<EOS>
as
the
majestic
Jos
step
out
of
the
creaking
vehicle
the
crowd
give
a
cheer
for
the
fat
gentleman
,
who
blush
and
look
very
big
and
mighty
,
as
he
walk
away
with
Rebecca
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
George
,
of
course
,
take
charge
of
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
as
happy
as
a
rose
-
tree
in
sunshine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Dobbin
,
"
say
George
,
"
just
look
to
the
shawl
and
thing
,
there
be
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
while
he
pair
off
with
Miss
Sedley
,
and
Jos
squeeze
through
the
gate
into
the
garden
with
Rebecca
at
his
side
,
honest
Dobbin
content
himself
by
give
an
arm
to
the
shawl
,
and
by
pay
at
the
door
for
the
whole
party
.
  
<EOS>
He
walk
very
modestly
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
willing
to
spoil
sport
.
 
<EOS>
about
Rebecca
and
Jos
he
do
not
care
a
fig
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
think
Amelia
worthy
even
of
the
brilliant
George
Osborne
,
and
as
he
see
that
good
-
look
couple
thread
the
walk
to
the
girl
's
delight
and
wonder
,
he
watch
her
artless
happiness
with
a
sort
of
fatherly
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
feel
that
he
would
have
like
to
have
something
on
his
own
arm
besides
a
shawl
<EOS>
(
the
people
laugh
at
see
the
gawky
young
officer
carry
this
female
burthen
)
;
but
William
Dobbin
be
very
little
addict
to
selfish
calculation
at
all
;
and
so
long
as
his
friend
be
enjoy
himself
,
how
should
he
be
discontent
?
<EOS>
and
the
truth
be
,
that
of
all
the
delight
of
the
Gardens
;
of
the
hundred
thousand
extra
lamp
,
which
be
always
light
;
the
fiddler
in
cocked
hat
,
who
play
ravish
melody
under
the
gilded
cockle
-
shell
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
;
the
singer
,
both
of
comic
and
sentimental
ballad
,
who
charm
the
ear
there
;
the
country
dance
,
form
by
bounce
cockney
and
cockneyesse
,
and
execute
amidst
jump
,
thumping
and
laughter
;
the
signal
which
announce
that
Madame
Saqui
be
about
to
mount
skyward
on
a
slack
-
rope
ascend
to
the
star
;
the
hermit
that
always
sit
in
the
illuminate
hermitage
;
the
dark
walk
,
so
favourable
to
the
interview
of
young
lover
;
the
pot
of
stout
hand
about
by
the
people
in
the
shabby
old
livery
;
and
the
twinkling
box
,
in
which
the
happy
feaster
make
-
believe
to
eat
slice
of
almost
invisible
ham
 
of
all
these
thing
,
and
of
the
gentle
Simpson
,
that
kind
smile
idiot
,
who
,
I
daresay
,
preside
even
then
over
the
place
 
<EOS>
Captain
William
Dobbin
do
not
take
the
slight
notice
.
  
<EOS>
He
carry
about
Amelia
's
white
cashmere
shawl
,
and
have
attend
under
the
gilt
cockle
-
shell
,
while
Mrs.
Salmon
perform
the
Battle
of
Borodino
(
a
savage
cantata
against
the
corsican
upstart
,
who
have
lately
meet
with
his
russian
reverse
)
 
Mr.
Dobbin
try
to
hum
it
as
he
walk
away
,
and
find
he
be
hum
 
the
tune
which
Amelia
Sedley
sing
on
the
stair
,
as
she
come
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
He
burst
out
laugh
at
himself
;
for
the
truth
be
,
he
could
sing
no
well
than
an
owl
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
understand
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
our
young
people
,
be
in
party
of
two
and
two
,
make
the
most
solemn
promise
to
keep
together
during
the
evening
,
and
separate
in
ten
minute
afterwards
.
<EOS>
party
at
Vauxhall
always
do
separate
,
but
'
twas
only
to
meet
again
at
supper
-
time
,
when
they
could
talk
of
their
mutual
adventure
in
the
interval
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
adventure
of
Mr.
Osborne
and
Miss
Amelia
?
<EOS>
that
be
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
sure
of
this
 
<EOS>
they
be
perfectly
happy
,
and
correct
in
their
behaviour
;
and
as
they
have
be
in
the
habit
of
be
together
any
time
these
fifteen
year
,
their
tete
-
a
-
tete
offer
no
particular
novelty
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Miss
Rebecca
Sharp
and
her
stout
companion
lose
themselves
in
a
solitary
walk
,
in
which
there
be
not
above
five
score
more
of
<EOS>
couple
similarly
stray
<EOS>
,
they
both
feel
that
the
situation
be
extremely
tender
and
critical
,
and
now
or
never
be
the
moment
Miss
Sharp
think
,
to
provoke
that
declaration
which
be
tremble
on
the
timid
lip
of
Mr.
Sedley
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
previously
be
to
the
panorama
of
Moscow
,
where
a
rude
fellow
,
tread
on
Miss
Sharp
's
foot
,
cause
her
to
fall
back
with
a
little
shriek
into
the
arm
of
Mr.
Sedley
,
and
this
little
incident
increase
the
tenderness
and
confidence
of
that
gentleman
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
tell
her
several
of
his
favourite
indian
story
over
again
for
,
at
least
,
the
sixth
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
I
should
like
to
see
India
!
"
say
Rebecca
.
  
<EOS>
"
SHOULD
you
?
"
<EOS>
say
Joseph
,
with
a
most
killing
tenderness
;
and
be
no
doubt
about
to
follow
up
this
artful
interrogatory
by
a
question
still
more
tender
(
for
he
puff
and
pant
a
great
deal
,
and
Rebecca
's
hand
,
which
be
place
near
his
heart
,
could
count
the
feverish
pulsation
of
that
organ
)
,
<EOS>
when
,
oh
,
provoking
!
<EOS>
the
bell
ring
for
the
firework
,
and
,
a
great
scuffling
and
run
take
place
,
these
interesting
lover
be
oblige
to
follow
in
the
stream
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Dobbin
have
some
thought
of
join
the
party
at
supper
:
as
,
in
truth
,
he
find
the
Vauxhall
amusement
not
particularly
lively
 
<EOS>
but
he
parade
twice
before
the
box
where
the
now
united
couple
be
meet
,
and
nobody
take
any
notice
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
cover
be
lay
for
four
.
 
<EOS>
the
mate
pair
be
prattle
away
quite
happily
,
and
Dobbin
know
he
be
as
clean
forget
as
if
he
have
never
exist
in
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
only
be
de
trop
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
look
at
them
rather
wistfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
best
go
and
talk
to
the
hermit
,
"
 
and
so
he
stroll
off
out
of
the
hum
of
man
,
and
noise
,
and
clatter
of
the
banquet
,
into
the
dark
walk
,
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
which
live
that
well
-
know
pasteboard
Solitary
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
good
fun
for
Dobbin
 
and
,
indeed
,
to
be
alone
at
Vauxhall
<EOS>
,
I
have
find
,
from
my
own
experience
,
to
be
one
of
the
most
dismal
sport
ever
enter
into
by
a
bachelor
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
couple
be
perfectly
happy
then
in
their
box
:
where
the
most
delightful
and
intimate
conversation
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
be
in
his
glory
,
order
about
the
waiter
with
great
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
the
salad
;
and
uncork
the
Champagne
;
and
carve
the
chicken
;
and
eat
and
drank
the
great
part
of
the
refreshment
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
finally
,
he
insist
upon
have
a
bowl
of
rack
punch
;
everybody
have
rack
punch
at
Vauxhall
.
"
<EOS>
waiter
,
rack
punch
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
bowl
of
rack
punch
be
the
cause
of
all
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
not
a
bowl
of
rack
punch
as
well
as
any
other
cause
?
<EOS>
be
not
a
bowl
of
prussic
acid
the
cause
of
<EOS>
Fair
Rosamond

retire
from

<EOS>
be
not
a
bowl
of
wine
<EOS>
the
cause
of
the
demise
of
Alexander
the
great
,
or
<EOS>
,
at
least
,
do
not
Dr.
Lempriere
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
so
do
this
bowl
of
rack
punch
influence
the
fate
of
all
the
principal
character
in
this
"
Novel
without
a
Hero
,
"
which
we
be
now
relate
.
 
<EOS>
It
influence
their
life
,
although
most
of
them
do
not
taste
a
drop
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
do
not
drink
it
;
Osborne
do
not
like
it
;
and
the
consequence
be
that
Jos
,
that
fat
gourmand
,
drink
up
the
whole
content
of
the
bowl
;
and
the
consequence
of
his
drinking
up
the
whole
content
of
the
bowl
be
a
liveliness
which
at
first
be
astonishing
,
and
then
become
almost
painful
;
for
he
talk
and
laugh
so
loud
as
to
bring
score
of
listener
<EOS>
round
the
box
,
much
to
the
confusion
of
the
innocent
party
within
it
;
and
,
volunteer
to
sing
a
song
(
which
he
do
in
that
maudlin
high
key
peculiar
to
gentleman
in
an
inebriated
state
)
<EOS>
,
he
almost
draw
away
the
audience
who
be
gather
round
the
musician
in
the
gilt
scollop

and
receive
from
his

"

Mr.

just

the
point

knock
down
a
gentleman
in
top

boot
,
who
propose
to
take
advantage
of
this
invitation
,
and
a
commotion
seem
to
be
inevitable
,
when
by
the
great
good
luck
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Dobbin
,
who
have
be
walk
about

vanish
presently
before

and
fierce
appearance

<EOS>
"
Good

"
<EOS>
osborne

,
seize
the
white
cashmere
shawl
from
his
friend

arm
,
and
huddle
up
Amelia
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
make
yourself
useful

<EOS>
Jos
be
for
rise
to
interfere
 
<EOS>
but
a
single
push
from
Osborne
's
finger
send
him
puff
back
into
his
seat
again
,
and
the
lieutenant
be
enable
to
remove
the
lady
in
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
kiss
his
hand
to
them
as
they
retreat
,
and
hiccup
out
"
bless
you

<EOS>
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
then
,
seize
Captain
Dobbin
's
hand
,
and
weep
in
the
most
pitiful
way
,
he
confide
to
that
gentleman
the
secret
of
his
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
adore
that
girl
who
have
just
go
out
;
he
have
break
her
heart
,
he
know
he
have
,
by
his
conduct
;
he
would
marry
her
next
morning
at
St.
George
's
,
Hanover
Square
;
he
would
knock
up
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
at
Lambeth
:
he
would
,
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
and
have
him
in
readiness
;
and
,
act
on
this
hint
,
Captain
Dobbin
shrewdly
induce
him
to
leave
the
garden
and
hasten
to
Lambeth
Palace
,
and
,
when
once
out
of
the
gate
,
easily
convey
Mr.
Jos
Sedley
into
a
hackney

coach
,
which
deposit
him
safely

<EOS>
George

conduct
the

home

and
when

be
close
upon

and
as
he
walk
across
Russell
Square
,
laugh
so
as
to
astonish
the

.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
look
very
ruefully
at
her
friend
,
as
they
go
up
stair
,
and
kiss
her
,
and
go
to
bed
without
any
more
talking
.
  
<EOS>
"
He

think
Rebecca

<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>
He
must
propose
to

"
<EOS>
and
so
think
Amelia
,
too
.
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
she
think
of
the
dress
she
be
to
wear
as
bridesmaid
,
and
of
the
present
which
she
should
make
to
her
nice
little

in

of
a
subsequent

at

o'clock

take

way
into
Oxford

summon
a
coach
from
a
stand
there

<EOS>
It
be
needless

to
state
that
the
driver
be
station
thus
early
in

reel
homeward

may
need
the
aid
of
his
vehicle

and
pay
him
with
the
generosity
of
intoxication

<EOS>
It
be
likewise
needless
to
say
that
the
driver
,
if
he
have
any
such
hope
as
those
above
state

be
grossly
disappointed
;

that
the

not
give
him
one
single
penny
more
than
his
fare

It

you

with

the

I

of

rudely
and
insolently
to

(
alas

<EOS>
twas
safe

)
,
I
be
give
over
to
Sir
p."s
care
,
and
make
to
pass
the
night
in
an
old
gloomy
bed
,
and
by
the
side
of
a
horrid
gloomy
old
charwoman
,
who
keep
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
sleep
one
single
wink
the
whole
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
be
not
what
we
silly
girl
,
when
we
use
to
read
Cecilia
at
Chiswick
,
imagine
a
baronet
must
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
anything
,
indeed
,
less
like
Lord
Orville
can
not
be
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
Fancy
an
old
,
stumpy
,
short
,
vulgar
,
and
very
dirty
man
,
in
old
clothe
and
shabby
old
gaiter
,
who
smoke
a
horrid
pipe
,
and
cook
his
own
horrid
supper
in
a
saucepan
.
<EOS>
He
speak
with
a
country
accent
,
and
swear
a
great
deal
at
the
old
charwoman
,
at
the
hackney
coachman
who
drive
us
to
the
inn
where
the
coach
go
from
,
and
on
which
I
make
the
journey
outside
for
the
GREATER
PART
of
the
WAY
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
awaken
at
daybreak
by
the
charwoman
,
and
have
arrive
at
the
inn
,
be
at
first
place
inside
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
we
get
to
a
place
call
Leakington
,
where
the
rain
begin
to
fall
very
heavily
 
will
you
believe
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
come
outside
;
for
Sir
Pitt
be
a
proprietor
of
the
coach
,
and
as
a
passenger
come
at
Mudbury
,
who
want
an
inside
place
,
I
be
oblige
to
go
outside
in
the
rain
,
where
,
however
,
a
young
gentleman
from
Cambridge
College
shelter
me
very
kindly
in
one
of
his
several
great
coat
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
and
the
guard
seem
to
know
Sir
Pitt
very
well
,
and
laugh
at
him
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
agree
in
call
him
an
old
screw
;
which
mean
a
very
stingy
,
avaricious
person
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
give
any
money
to
anybody
,
they
say
(
and
this
meanness
I
hate
)
;
and
the
young
gentleman
make
me
remark
that
we
drive
very
slow
for
the
last
two
stage
on
the
road
,
because
Sir
Pitt
be
on
the
box
,
and
because
he
be
proprietor
of
the
horse
for
this
part
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
will
not
I
flog
'em
on
to
Squashmore
,
when
I
take
the
ribbon
?
"
say
the
young
Cantab
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
sarve
'em
right
,
Master
Jack
,
"
say
the
guard
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
comprehend
the
meaning
of
this
phrase
,
and
that
Master
Jack
intend
to
drive
the
rest
of
the
way
,
and
revenge
himself
on
Sir
Pitt
's
horse
,
of
course
I
laugh
too
.
  
<EOS>
a
carriage
and
four
splendid
horse
,
cover
with
armorial
bearing
,
however
,
await
us
at
Mudbury
,
four
mile
from
Queen
's
Crawley
,
and
we
make
our
entrance
to
the
baronet
's
park
in
state
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
avenue
of
a
mile
long
lead
to
the
house
,
and
the
woman
at
the
lodge
-
gate
(
over
the
pillar
of
which
be
a
serpent
and
a
dove
,
the
supporter
of
the
Crawley
arm
)
,
make
us
a
number
of
curtsy
<EOS>
as
she
fling
open
the
old
iron
carve
door
,
which
be
something
like
those
at
odious
Chiswick
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
an
avenue
,
"
say
Sir
Pitt
,
"
a
mile
long

<EOS>
there

six
thousand
pound

<EOS>
do

call
that
nothing

"
<EOS>
He
pronounce
avenue
 
EVENUE
,
and
nothing
 
NOTHINK
,
so
droll
;
and
he
have
a
Mr.
Hodson
,
his
hind
from
Mudbury
,
into
the
carriage
with
him
,
and
they
talk
about
distrain
,
and
sell
up
,
and
draining
and
subsoile
,
and
a
great
deal
about
tenant
and
farming
 
much
more
than
I
could
understand
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
Miles
have
be
catch
poaching
,
and
Peter
Bailey
have
go
to
the
workhouse
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
serve
him
right
,
"
say
Sir
Pitt
;
"
him
and
his
family
have
be
cheat
me
on
that
farm
these
hundred
and
fifty
year
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
some
old
tenant
,
I
suppose
,
who
could
not
pay
his
rent
.
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
may
have
say
"
he
and
his
family
,
"
to
be
sure
;
but
rich
baronet
do
not
need
to
be
careful
about
grammar
,
as
poor
governess
must
be
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
pass
,
I
remark
a
beautiful
church
-
spire
rise
above
some
old
elm
in
the
park
;
and
before
them
,
in
the
midst
of
a
lawn
,
and
some
outhouse
,
an
old
red
house
with
tall
chimney
cover
with
ivy
,
and
the
window
shine
in
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
your
church

sir
?
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
hang
it
,
"
(
say
Sir
Pitt
,
only
he
use
,
dear
,
a
much
WICKEDER
word
)
;
"
how
be
Buty

<EOS>
Buty

<EOS>
Buty

"
  
<EOS>
Hodson
laugh
too
,
and
then
look
more
grave
and
nod
his
head
,
say
,
"
I
be
afraid

Sir
Pitt

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
"
look

<EOS>
Will

<EOS>
He
be
as
tough
as

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

laugh
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
young

be
home
from

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
"
Whop

<EOS>
roar
out
Sir

.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
on
the
parson
's
ground
,
sir
,
"
reply
Mr.
Hodson
;
and
Sir
Pitt
in
a
fury
swore
that
if
he
ever
catch
'em
poach
on
his
ground
,
he
would
transport
'em
,
by
the
lord
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
say
,
"
I
have
sell
the
presentation
of
the
living
,
Hodson
;
none
of
that
breed
shall
get
it
,
I
war'nt
"
;
and
Mr.
Hodson
say
he
be
quite
right
:
<EOS>
and
I
have
no
doubt
from
this
that
the
two
brother
be
at
variance
 
as
brother
often
be
,
and
sister
too
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
the
two
Miss
Scratchleys
at
Chiswick
,
how
they
use
always
to
fight
and
quarrel
 
and
Mary
Box
,
how
she
be
always
thump
Louisa
?
  
<EOS>
presently
,
see
two
little
boy
gather
stick
in
the
wood
,
Mr.
Hodson
jump
out
of
the
carriage
,
at
Sir
Pitt
's
order
,
and
rush
upon
them
with
his
whip
.
 
<EOS>
"
pitch
into
'em
,
Hodson
,
"
roar
the
baronet
;
"
flog
their
little
soul
out
,
and
bring
'em
up
to
the
house
,
the
vagabond
;
I
will
commit
'em
as
sure
as
my
name

Pitt

"
<EOS>
and
presently
we
hear
Mr.
Hodson
's
whip
crack
on
the
shoulder
of
the
poor
little
blubber
wretch
,
and
Sir
Pitt
,
see
that
the
malefactor
be
in
custody
,
drive
on
to
the
hall

<EOS>
all
the

<EOS>
here
,
my

I
be
interrupt
last
night
by
a
dreadful
thumping
at
my
door
:
and
who
do
you
think
it
be
?
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
in
his
night
-
cap
and
dressing
-
gown
,
such
a
figure
!
<EOS>
as
I
shrink
away
from
such
a
visitor
,
he
come
forward
and
seize
my
candle
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
candle

eleven
o'clock
,
Miss
Becky
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
go

dark
,
you

little
hussy
"
(
that
be
what
he
call

)
,
"
and
unless
you
wish
me
to
come
for
the
candle
every
night
,
mind
and
be
in
bed
at
eleven
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
this
,
he
and
Mr.
Horrocks
the
butler
go
off
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
shall
not
encourage
any
more
of
their
visit
.
 
<EOS>
They
let
loose
two
immense
bloodhound
at
night
,
which
all
last
night
be
yell
and
howl
at
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
"

say
Sir

;
"

<EOS>
Haw

"
  
<EOS>
before
the
house
of
Queen
's
Crawley
,
which
be
an
odious
old
-
fashioned
red
brick
mansion
,
with
tall
chimney
and
gable
of
the
style
of
Queen
Bess
,
there
be
a

flank
by
the

dove
and
serpent
,
and
on
which
the
great
hall

.
 
<EOS>
and
oh
,
my

,
the
great
hall
I
be
sure
be
as
big
and
as
glum
as

the
dear
castle
of

<EOS>
It
have
a
large
fireplace
,
in

may
put

<EOS>

<EOS>
at
one
end

I
promise

always
shut

and
there

but
when
the

I
expect

<EOS>
We
have

with
my

You

half

be
as
much

<EOS>
but
my
kind
reader
will
please
to
remember
that
this
history
have
"
Vanity
Fair
"
for
a
title
,
and
that
Vanity
Fair
be
a
very
vain
,
wicked
,
foolish
place
,
full
of
all
sort
of
humbug
and
falseness
and
pretension
.
 
<EOS>
and
while
the
moralist
,
who
be
hold
forth
on
the
cover
(
an
accurate
portrait
of
your
humble
servant
)
,
profess
to
wear
neither
gown
nor
band
,
but
only
the
very
same
long
-
eared
livery
in
which
his
congregation
be
array
:
yet
,
look
you
,
one
be
bind
to
speak
the
truth
as
far
as
one
know
it
,
whether
one
mount
a
cap
and
bell
or
a
shovel
hat
;
and
a
deal
of
disagreeable
matter
must
come
out
in
the
course
of
such
an
undertaking
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
a
brother
of
the
story
-
tell
trade
,
at
Naples
,
preach
to
a
pack
of
good
-
for
-
nothing
honest
lazy
fellow
by
the
sea
-
shore
,
work
himself
up
into
such
a
rage
and
passion
with
some
of
the
villain
whose
wicked
deed
he
be
describe
and
invent
,
that
the
audience
could
not
resist
it
;
and
they
and
the
poet
together
would
burst
out
into
a
roar
of
oath
and
execration
against
the
fictitious
monster
of
the
tale
,
so
that
the
hat
go
round
,
and
the
bajocchi
tumble
into
it
,
in
the
midst
of
a
perfect
storm
of
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
little
Paris
theatre
,
on
the
other
hand
,
you
will
not
only
hear
the
people
yell
out
"
ah
gredin
!
<EOS>
ah
monstre
:
"
and
curse
the
tyrant
of
the
play
from
the
box
;
but
the
actor
themselves
positively
refuse
to
play
the
wicked
part
,
such
as
those
of
infame
Anglais
,
brutal
Cossacks
,
and
what
not
,
and
prefer
to
appear
at
a
small
salary
,
in
their
real
character
as
loyal
frenchman
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
the
two
story
one
against
the
other
,
so
that
you
may
see
that
it
be
not
from
mere
mercenary
motive
that
the
present
performer
be
desirous
to
show
up
and
trounce
his
villain
;
but
because
he
have
a
sincere
hatred
of
them
,
which
he
can
not
keep
down
,
and
which
must
find
a
vent
in
suitable
abuse
and
bad
language
.
  
<EOS>
I
warn
my
"
kyind
friend
,
"
then
,
that
I
be
go
to
tell
a
story
of
harrow
villainy
and
complicated
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
trust
,
intensely
interesting
 
crime
.
 
<EOS>
My
rascal
be
no
milk

and
-
water
rascal
,
I
promise
you
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
proper
place
we
will
not
spare
fine
language
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
but
when
we
be
go
over
the
quiet
country
we
must
perforce
be
calm
.
 
<EOS>
a
temp
in
a
slop
-
basin
be
absurd
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
reserve
that
sort
of
thing
for
the
mighty
ocean
and
the
lonely
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
the
present
chapter
be
very
mild
.
 
<EOS>
other
 
<EOS>
but
we
will
not
anticipate
those
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
as
we
bring
our
character
forward
,
I
will
ask
leave
,
as
a
man
and
a
brother
,
not
only
to
introduce
them
,
but
occasionally
to
step
down
from
the
platform
,
and
talk
about
them
:
if
they
be
good
and
kindly
,
to
love
them
and
shake
them
by
the
hand
:
if
they
be
silly
,
to
laugh
at
them
confidentially
in
the
reader
's
sleeve
:
if
they
be
wicked
and
heartless
,
to
abuse
them
in
the
strong
term
which
politeness
admit
of
.
  
<EOS>
otherwise
you
may
fancy
<EOS>
it
be
I
who
be
sneer
at
the
practice
of
devotion
,
which
Miss
Sharp
find
so
ridiculous
;
<EOS>
that
it
be
I
who
laugh
good
-
humouredly
at
the
reel
old
Silenus
of
a
baronet
 
whereas
the
laughter
come
from
one
who
have
no
reverence
except
for
prosperity
,
and
no
eye
for
anything
beyond
success
.
<EOS>
such
people
there
be
live

flourish
in

Faithless

Hopeless

<EOS>
charityless

let

<EOS>
some
there
be

and
very

a
philosopher
with
a
taste
for
what
be
call
low
life
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
the
noble
Binkie
have
be
make
under
the
auspex
of
his
parent
;
and
as
he
often
tell
Lady
Crawley
in
her
lifetime
she
be
such
a
confounded
quarrelsome
high
-
breed
jade
that
when
she
die
he
be
hang
if
he
would
ever
take
another
of
her
sort
,
at
her
ladyship
's
demise
he
keep
his
promise
,
and
select
for
a
second
wife
Miss
Rose
Dawson
,
daughter
of
Mr.
John
Thomas
Dawson
,
ironmonger
,
of
Mudbury
.
<EOS>
what
a
happy
woman
be
Rose
to
be
my
Lady
Crawley
!
  
<EOS>
let
us
set
down
the
item
of
her
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
she
give
up
Peter
Butt
,
a
young
man
who
keep
company
with
her
,
and
in
consequence
of
his
disappointment
in
love
,
take
to
smuggling
,
poaching
,
and
a
thousand
other
bad
course
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
quarrel
,
as
in
duty
bind
,
with
all
the
friend
and
intimate
of
her
youth
,
who
,
of
course
,
could
not
be
receive
by
my
Lady
at
Queen
's
Crawley
 
nor
do
she
find
in
her
new
rank
and
abode
any
person
who
be
willing
to
welcome
her
.
<EOS>
who
ever
do
?
<EOS>
Sir
Huddleston
Fuddleston
have
three
daughter
who
all
hope
to
be
Lady
Crawley
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
Wapshot
's
family
be
insult
that
one
of
the
Wapshot
girl
have
not
the
preference
in
the
marriage
,
and
the
remain
baronet
of
the
county
be
indignant
at
their
comrade
's
misalliance
.
 
<EOS>
never
mind
the
commoner
,
whom
we
will
leave
to
grumble
anonymously
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
do
not
care
,
as
he
say
,
a
brass
farden
for
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
pretty
Rose
,
and
what
more
need
a
man
require
than
to
please
himself
?
<EOS>
so
he
use
to
get
drunk
every
night
:
to
beat
his
pretty
Rose
sometimes
:
to
leave
her
in
Hampshire
when
he
go
to
London
for
the
parliamentary
session
,
without
a
single
friend
in
the
wide
world
.
 
<EOS>
even
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
,
the
rector
's
wife
,
refuse
to
visit
her
,
as
she
say
she
would
never
give
the
pas
to
a
tradesman
's
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
only
endowment
with
which
Nature
have
gift
Lady
Crawley
be
those
of
pink
cheek
and
a
white
skin
,
and
as
she
have
no
sort
of
character
,
nor
talent
,
nor
opinion
,
nor
occupation
,
nor
amusement
,
nor
that
vigour
of
soul
and
ferocity
of
temper
which
often
fall
to
the
lot
of
entirely
foolish
woman
,
her
hold
upon
Sir
Pitt
's
affection
be
not
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
Her
rose
fade
out
of
her
cheek
,
and
the
pretty
freshness
leave
her
figure
after
the
birth
of
a
couple
of
child
,
and
she
become
a
mere
machine
in
her
husband
's
house
of
no
more
use
than
the
late
Lady
Crawley
's
grand
piano
.
<EOS>
be
a
light
-
complexioned
woman
,
she
wear
light
clothe
,
as
most
blonde
will
,
and
appear
,
in
preference
,
in
draggle
sea
-
green
,
or
slatternly
sky
-
blue
.
 
<EOS>
She
work
that
worst
day
and
night
,
or
other
piece
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
counterpane
in
the
course
of
a
few
year
to
all
the
bed
in
Crawley
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
small
flower
-
garden
,
for
which
she
have
rather
an
affection
;
but
beyond
this
no
other
like
or
disliking
.
 
<EOS>
when
her
husband
be
rude
to
her
<EOS>
she
be
apathetic
:
whenever
he
strike
her
she
cry
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
character
enough
to
take
to
drinking
,
and
moan
about
,
slipshod
and
in
curl
-
paper
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
o
Vanity
Fair
 
Vanity
Fair
!
<EOS>
this
may
have
be
,
but
for
you
,
a
cheery
lass
 
Peter
Butt
and
rise
a
happy
man
and
wife
,
in
a
snug
farm
,
with
a
hearty
family
;
and
an
honest
portion
of
pleasure
,
care
,
hope
and
struggle
 
but
a
title
and
a
coach
and
four
be
toy
more
precious
than
happiness
in
Vanity
Fair
:
and
if
Harry
the
Eighth
or
Bluebeard
be
alive
now
,
and
want
a
tenth
wife
,
do
you
suppose
he
could
not
get
the
pretty
girl
that
shall
be
present
this
season
?
  
<EOS>
the
languid
dulness
of
their
mamma
do
not
,
as
it
may
be
suppose
,
awaken
much
affection
in
her
little
daughter
,
but
they
be
very
happy
in
the
servant
'
hall
and
in
the
stable
;
and
the
Scotch
gardener
have
luckily
a
good
wife
and
some
good
child
,
they
get
a
little
wholesome
society
and
instruction
in
his
lodge
,
which
be
the
only
education
bestow
upon
them
until
Miss
Sharp
come
.
  
<EOS>
Her
engagement
be
owe
to
the
remonstrance
of
Mr.
Pitt
Crawley
,
<EOS>
the
only
friend
or
protector
Lady
Crawley
ever
have
,
and
the
only
person
,
besides
her
child
,
for
whom
she
entertain
a
little
feeble
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Pitt
take
after
the
noble
Binkies
,
from
whom
he
be
descend
,
and
be
a
very
polite
and
proper
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
grow
to
man
's
estate
,
and
come
back
from
Christchurch
,
he
begin
to
reform
the
slacken
discipline
of
the
hall
,
in
spite
of
his
father
,
who
stand
in
awe
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
such
rigid
refinement
,
that
he
would
have
starve
rather
than
have
dine
without
a
white
neckcloth
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
when
just
from
college
,
and
when
Horrocks
the
butler
bring
him
a
letter
without
place
it
previously
on
a
tray
,
he
give
that
domestic
a
look
,
and
administer
to
him
a
speech
so
cut
,
that
Horrocks
ever
after
tremble
before
him
;
the
whole
household
bow
to
him
:
<EOS>
Lady
Crawley
's
curl
-
paper
come
off
earlier
when
he
be
at
home
:
Sir
Pitt
's
muddy
gaiter
disappear
;
and
if
that
incorrigible
old
man
still
adhere
to
other
old
habit
,
he
never
fuddle
himself
with
rum
-
and
-
water
in
his
son
's
presence
,
and
only
talk
to
his
servant
in
a
very
reserved
and
polite
manner
;
and
those
person
remark
that
Sir
Pitt
never
swear
at
Lady
Crawley
while
his
son
be
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
teach
the
butler
to
say
,
"
My
lady
be
serve
,
"
and
who
insist
on
hand
her
ladyship
in
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
seldom
speak
to
her
,
but
when
he
do
it
be
with
the
most
powerful
respect
;
and
he
never
let
her
quit
the
apartment
without
rise
in
the
most
stately
manner
to
open
the
door
,
and
make
an
elegant
bow
at
her
egress
.
  
<EOS>
at
Eton
he
be
call
Miss
Crawley
;
and
there
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
his
young
brother
Rawdon
use
to
lick
him
violently
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
his
part
be
not
brilliant
,
he
make
up
for
his
lack
of
talent
by
meritorious
industry
,
and
be
never
know
,
during
eight
year
at
school
,
to
be
subject
to
that
punishment
which
it
be
generally
think
none
but
a
cherub
can
escape
.
  
<EOS>
at
college
his
career
be
of
course
highly
creditable
.
<EOS>
and
here
he
prepare
himself
for
public
life
,
into
which
he
be
to
be
introduce
by
the
patronage
of
his
grandfather
,
Lord
Binkie
,
by
study
the
ancient
and
modern
orator
with
great
assiduity
,
and
by
speak
unceasingly
at
the
debate
society
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
he
have
a
fine
flux
of
word
,
and
deliver
his
little
voice
with
great
pomposity
and
pleasure
to
himself
,
and
never
advance
any
sentiment
or
opinion
which
be
not
perfectly
trite
and
stale
,
and
support
by
a
latin
quotation
;
yet
he
fail
somehow
,
in
spite
of
a
mediocrity
which
ought
to
have
insure
any
man
a
success
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
even
get
the
prize
poem
,
which
all
his
friend
say
he
be
sure
of
.
  
<EOS>
after
leave
college
he
become
Private
Secretary
to
Lord
Binkie
,
and
be
then
appoint
Attache
to
the
Legation
at
Pumpernickel
,
which
post
he
fill
with
perfect
honour
,
and
bring
home
despatch
,
consist
of
Strasburg
pie
,
to
the
Foreign
Minister
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
after
remain
ten
year
Attache
(
several
year
after
the
lament
Lord
Binkie
's
demise
)
,
and
find
the
advancement
slow
,
he
at
length
give
up
the
diplomatic
service
in
some
disgust
,
and
begin
to
turn
country
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
He
write
a
pamphlet
on
Malt
on
return
to
England
(
for
he
be
an
ambitious
man
,
and
always
like
to
be
before
the
public
)
,
and
take
a
strong
part
in
the
Negro
Emancipation
question
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
become
a
friend
of
Mr.
Wilberforce
's
,
whose
politic
he
admire
,
and
have
that
famous
correspondence
with
the
Reverend
Silas
Hornblower
,
on
the
Ashantee
Mission
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
London
,
if
not
for
the
Parliament
session
,
at
least
in
May
,
for
the
religious
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
country
he
be
a
magistrate
,
and
an
active
visitor
and
speaker
among
those
destitute
of
religious
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
say
to
be
pay
his
address
to
Lady
Jane
Sheepshanks
,
Lord

third
daughter
,
and
whose

those
sweet

,
"
the
Sailor
's
true
Binnacle
,
"
and
"
the
Applewoman
of
Finchley
Common
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Sharp
's
account
of
his
employment
at
Queen
's
Crawley
be
not
caricature
.
 
<EOS>
He
subject
the
servant
there
to
the
devotional
exercise
before
mention
,
in
which
(
and
so
much
the
well
)
<EOS>
he
bring
his
father
to
join
.
 
<EOS>
He
patronise
an
independent
meeting
-
house
in
Crawley
parish
,
much
to
the
indignation
of
his
uncle
the
Rector
,
and
to
the
consequent
delight
of
Sir
Pitt
,
who
be
induce
to
go
himself
once
or
twice
,
which
occasion
some
violent
sermon
at
Crawley
parish
church
,
direct
point
-
blank
at
the
Baronet
's
old
gothic
pew
there
.
<EOS>
honest
Sir
Pitt
,
however
,
do
not
feel
the
force
of
these
discourse
,
as
he
always
take
his
nap
during
sermon
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawley
be
very
earnest
,
for
the
good
of
the
nation
and
of
the
christian
world
,
that
the
old
gentleman
should
yield
him
up
his
place
in
Parliament
;
but
this
the
elder
constantly
refuse
to
do
.
<EOS>
both
be
of
course
too
prudent
to
give
up
the
fifteen
hundred
a
year
which
be
bring
in
by
the
second
seat
(
at
this
period
fill
by
Mr.
Quadroon
,
with
carte
blanche
on
the
Slave
question
)
;
indeed
the
family
estate
be
much
embarrassed
,
and
the
income
draw
from
the
borough
be
of
great
use
to
the
house
of
Queen
's
Crawley
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
never
recover
the
heavy
fine
impose
upon
Walpole
Crawley
,
first
baronet
,
for
peculation
in
the
Tape
and
Sealing
Wax
Office
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walpole
be
a
jolly
fellow
,
eager
to
seize
and
to
spend
money
(
alieni
appetens
,
sui
profusus
,
as
Mr.
Crawley
would
remark
with
a
sigh
)
,
and
in
his
day
belove
by
all
the
county
for
the
constant
drunkenness
and
hospitality
which
be
maintain
at
Queen
's
Crawley
.
<EOS>
the
cellar
be
fill
with
burgundy
<EOS>
then
,
the
kennel
with
hound
,
and
the
stable
with
gallant
hunter
;
now
,
such
horse
as
Queen
's
Crawley
possess
go
to
plough
,
or
run
in
the
Trafalgar
Coach
;
and
it
be
with
a
team
of
these
very
horse
,
on
an
off
-
day
,
that
Miss
Sharp
be
bring
to
the
Hall
;
for
boor
as
he
be
,
Sir
Pitt
be
a
stickler
for
his
dignity
while
at
home
,
and
seldom
drive
out
but
with
four
horse
,
and
though
he
dine
off
boil
mutton
,
have
always
three
footman
to
serve
it
.
  
<EOS>
if
mere
parsimony
could
have
make
a
man
rich
,
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
may
have
become
very
wealthy
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
an
attorney
in
a
country
town
,
with
no
capital
but
his
brain
,
it
be
very
possible
that
he
would
have
turn
them
to
good
account
,
and
may
have
achieve
for
himself
a
very
considerable
influence
and
competency
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
unluckily
endow
with
a
good
name
and
a
large
though
encumber
estate
,
both
of
which
go
rather
to
injure
than
to
advance
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
taste
for
law
,
which
cost
him
many
thousand
yearly
;
and
be
a
great
deal
too
clever
to
be
rob
,
as
he
say
,
by
any
single
agent
,
allow
his
affair
to
be
mismanage
by
a
dozen
,
whom
he
all
equally
mistrusted
.
<EOS>
He
be
such
a
sharp
landlord
,
that
he
could
hardly
find
any
but
bankrupt
tenant
;
and
such
a
close
farmer
,
as
to
grudge
almost
the
seed
to
the
ground
,
whereupon
revengeful
Nature
grudge
him
the
crop
which
she
grant
to
more
liberal
husbandman
.
<EOS>
He
speculate
in
every
possible
way
;
he
work
mine
;
buy
canal
-
share
;
horsed
coach
;
take
government
contract
,
and
be
the
busy
man
and
magistrate
of
his
county
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
would
not
pay
honest
agent
at
his
granite
quarry
,
he
have
the
satisfaction
of
find
that
four
overseer
run
away
,
and
take
fortune
with
them
to
America
.
 
<EOS>
for
want
of
proper
precaution
,
his
coal
-
mine
fill
with
water
:
the
government
fling
his
contract
of
damage
beef
upon
his
hand
:
and
for
his
coach
-
horse
,
every
mail
proprietor
in
the
kingdom
know
that
he
lose
more
horse
than
any
man
in
the
country
,
from
underfeeding
and
buy
cheap
.
<EOS>
in
disposition
he
be
sociable
,
and
far
from
be
proud
;
nay
,
he
rather
prefer
the
society
of
a
farmer
or
a
horse
-
dealer
to
that
of
a
gentleman
,
like
my
lord
,
his
son
:
<EOS>
he
be
fond
of
drink
,
of
swearing
,
of
joke
with
the
farmer
'
daughter
:
he
be
never
know
to
give
away
a
shilling
or
to
do
a
good
action
,
but
be
of
a
pleasant
,
sly
,
laugh
mood
,
and
would
cut
his
joke
and
drink
his
glass
with
a
tenant
and
sell
him
up
the
next
day
;
or
have
his
laugh
with
the
poacher
he
be
transport
with
equal
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
His
politeness
for
the
fair
sex
have
already
be
hint
at
by
Miss
Rebecca
Sharp
 
in
a
word
,
the
whole
baronetage
,
peerage
,
commonage
of
England
,
do
not
contain
a
more
cunning

that

it

one

cause
<EOS>
why
Mr.

have
such

the
Baronet
owe
his

a
sum
of
money
out
of
the
jointure
of
his

which
he
do
not
find
it
convenient
to

indeed
he
have
an
almost
invincible
repugnance
to
pay
anybody
,
and
could
only
be
bring
by
force
to
discharge
his

Miss

calculate
(

as

hear
speedily
,
induct
into
most
of
the
secret
of
the

)
that
the
mere
payment
of
his
creditor
cost
the
honourable
Baronet
several
hundred
yearly
;
but
this
be
a
delight
he
could
not
forego
;
he
have
a
savage
pleasure
in
make
the
poor
wretch
wait

Miss

and
now
,
be
receive
as
a
member
of
the
amiable
family
whose
portrait
we
have
sketch
in

it
become
naturally
Rebecca

duty
to
make
herself
,
as
she
say
,
agreeable
to
her
benefactor
,
and
to
gain
their
confidence
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
.
<EOS>
who
can
but
admire
this
quality
of
gratitude
in
an
unprotected
orphan
;
and
,
if
there
enter
some
degree
of
selfishness
into
her
calculation
,
who
can
say
but
that
her
prudence
be
perfectly
justifiable
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
alone
in
the
world
,
"
say
the
friendless
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
look
for
but
what
my
own
labour
can
bring
me
;
and
while
that
little
pink

faced
chit
Amelia
,
with
not
half
my
sense
,
have
ten
thousand
pound
and
an
establishment
secure

poor
Rebecca
(
and
<EOS>
my
figure
be
far
well
than
her
)
have
only
herself
and
her
own
wit
to
trust
to
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
let
us
see
if
my
wit
can
not
provide
me
with
an
honourable
maintenance
,
and
if
some
day
or
the
other
I
can
not
show
Miss
Amelia
<EOS>
my
real
superiority
over
her
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
dislike
poor
Amelia
:
who
can
dislike
such
a
harmless
,
good

natured
creature

<EOS>
only
it
will
be
a
fine
day
when
I
can
take
my
place
above
her
in
the
world
,
as
why
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
should
I
not
?
"
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
our
little
romantic
friend
form
vision
of
the
future
for
herself
 
nor
must
we
be
scandalise
that
,
in
all
her
castle
in
the
air
,
a
husband
be
the
principal
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
of
what
else
have
young
lady
to
think
,
but
husband
?
<EOS>
of
what
else
do
their
dear
mamma
think
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
my
own
mamma
,
"
say
Rebecca
;
not
without
a
tingle
consciousness
of
defeat
,
as
she
think
over
her
little
misadventure
with
Jos
Sedley
.
  
<EOS>
so
she
wisely
determine
to
render
her
position
with
the
Queen
's
Crawley
family
comfortable
and
secure
,
and
to
this
end
resolve
to
make
friend
of
every
one
around
her
who
could
at
all
interfere
with
her
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
as
my
Lady
Crawley
be
not
one
of
these
personage
,
and
a
woman
,
moreover
,
so
indolent
and
void
of
character
as
not
to
be
of
the
least
consequence
in
her
own
house
,
Rebecca
soon
find
that
it
be
not
at
all
necessary
to
cultivate
her
good
will
 
indeed
,
impossible
to
gain
it
.
<EOS>
She
use
to
talk
to
her
pupil
about
their
"
poor
mamma
"
;
and
,
though
she
treat
that
lady
with
every
demonstration
of
cool
respect
,
it
be
to
the
rest
of
the
family
that
she
wisely
direct
the
chief
part
of
her
attention
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
young
people
,
whose
applause
she
thoroughly
gain
,
her
method
be
pretty
simple
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
pester
their
young
brain
with
too
much
learn
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
let
them
have
their
own
way
in
regard
to
educate
themselves
;
for
what
instruction
be
more
effectual
than
self
-
instruction
?
<EOS>
the
eld
be
rather
fond
of
book
,
and
as
there
be
in
the
old
library
at
Queen
's
Crawley
a
considerable
provision
of
work
of
light
literature
of
the
last
century
,
both
in
the
french
and
english
language
(
they
have
be
purchase
by
the
Secretary
of
the
Tape
and
Sealing
Wax
Office
at
the
period
of
his
disgrace
)
,
and
as
nobody
ever
trouble
the
bookshelf
but
herself
,
Rebecca
be
enable
agreeably
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
in
playing
,
to
impart
a
great
deal
of
instruction
to
Miss
Rose
Crawley
.
  
<EOS>
She
and
Miss
Rose
thus
read
together
many
delightful
french
and
english
work
,
among
which
may
be
mention
those
of
the
learn
Dr.
Smollett
,
of
the
ingenious
Mr.
Henry
Fielding
,
of
the
graceful
and
fantastic
Monsieur
Crebillon
the
young
,
whom
our
immortal
poet
Gray
so
much
admired
,
and
of
the
universal
Monsieur
de
Voltaire
.
<EOS>
once
,
when
Mr.
Crawley
ask
what
the
young
people
be
read
,
the
governess
reply
"
Smollett
.
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Smollett
,
"
say
Mr.
Crawley
,
quite
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
history
be
more
dull
,
but
by
no
means
so
dangerous
as
that
of
Mr.
Hume
.
<EOS>
It
be
history
you
be
read
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Miss
Rose
;
without
,
however
,
add
that
it
be
the
history
of
Mr.
Humphrey
Clinker
.
 
<EOS>
on
another
occasion
he
be
rather
scandalise
at
find
his
sister
with
a
book
of
french
play
;
but
as
the
governess
remark
that
it
be
for
the
purpose
of
acquire
the
french
idiom
in
conversation
,
he
be
fain
to
be
content
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Crawley
,
as
a
diplomatist
,
be
exceedingly
proud
of
his
own
skill
in
speak
the
french
language
(
for
he
be
of
the
world
still
)
,
and
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
compliment
which
the
governess
continually
pay
him
upon
his
proficiency
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Violet
's
taste
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
more
rude
and
boisterous
than
those
of
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
the
sequester
spot
where
the
hen
lay
their
egg
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
climb
a
tree
to
rob
the
nest
of
the
feather
songster
of
their
speckle
spoil
.
 
<EOS>
and
her
pleasure
be
to
ride
the
young
colt
,
and
to
scour
the
plain
like
Camilla
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
favourite
of
her
father
and
of
the
stableman
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
darling
,
and
withal
the
terror
of
the
cook
;
for
she
discover
the
haunt
of
the
jam
-
pot
,
and
would
attack
them
when
they
be
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
sister
be
engage
in
constant
battle
.
 
<EOS>
any
of
which
peccadilloe
,
if
Miss
Sharp
discover
,
she
do
not
tell
them
to
Lady
Crawley
;
who
would
have
tell
them
to
the
father
,
or
bad
,
to
Mr.
Crawley
;
but
promise
not
to
tell
if
Miss
Violet
would
be
a
good
girl
and
love
her
governess
.
  
<EOS>
with
Mr.
Crawley
Miss
Sharp
be
respectful
and
obedient
.
 
<EOS>
She
use
to
consult
him
on
passage
of
French
which
she
could
not
understand
,
though
her
mother
be
a
Frenchwoman
,
and
which
he
would
construe
to
her
satisfaction
:
and
,
besides
give
her
his
aid
in
profane
literature
,
he
be
kind
enough
to
select
for
her
book
of
a
more
serious
tendency
,
and
address
to
her
much
of
his
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
She
admire
,
beyond
measure
,
his
speech
at
the
Quashimaboo
-
Aid
Society
;
take
an
interest
in
his
pamphlet
on
malt
:
be
often
affect
,
even
to
tear
,
by
his
discourse
of
an
evening
,
and
would
say
 
"
oh
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
with
a
sigh
,
and
a
look
up
to
heaven
,
that
make
him
occasionally
condescend
to
shake
hand
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
blood
be
everything

after
all

"
would
that
aristocratic
religionist
say

<EOS>
"
how
Miss

when
not
one
of

<EOS>
I
be
too
fine
for

too
delicate

<EOS>
I
must
familiarise
my
style
 
<EOS>
but
she
understand
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
a
montmorency
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
from
this
famous
family
,
as
it
appear
,
that
Miss
Sharp
,
by
the
mother
's
side
,
be
descend
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
do
not
say
that
her
mother
have
be
on
the
stage
;
it
would
have
shock
Mr.
Crawley
's
religious
scruple
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
noble
emigre
have
this
horrid
revolution
plunge
in
poverty
!
 
<EOS>
She
have
several
story
about
her
ancestor
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
she
have
be
many
month
in
the
house
;
some
of
which
Mr.
Crawley
happen
to
find
in
D'Hozier
's
dictionary
,
which
be
in
the
library
,
and
which
strengthen
his
belief
in
their
truth
,
and
in
the
high
-
breeding
of
Rebecca
.
 
<EOS>
be
we
to
suppose
from
this
curiosity
and
pry
into
dictionary
<EOS>
,
could
our
heroine
suppose
that
Mr.
Crawley
be
interested
in
her
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
only
in
a
friendly
way
.
 
<EOS>
have
we
not
state
that
he
be
attach
to
Lady
Jane
Sheepshanks
?
  
<EOS>
He
take
Rebecca
to
task
once
or
twice
about
the
propriety
of
play
at
backgammon
with
Sir
Pitt
,
say
that
it
be
a
godless
amusement
,
and
that
she
would
be
much
better
engage
in
read
"
Thrump
's
Legacy
,
"
or
"
the
Blind
Washerwoman
of
Moorfields
,
"
or
any
work
of
a
more
serious
nature
;
but
Miss
Sharp
say
her
dear
mother
use
often
to
play
the
same
game
with
the
old
Count
de
Trictrac
and
the
venerable
Abbe
du
Cornet
,
and
so
find
an
excuse
for
this
and
other
worldly
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
only
by
play

She

She

<EOS>
indeed

Rawdon
Crawley

have
a
great
contempt
for
the

altogether

seldom

<EOS>
in

the

<EOS>
Old

be
certainly
one
of
the
reprobate
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
snug
little
house
in
Park
Lane
,
and
,
as
she
eat
and
drank
a
great
deal
too
much
during
the
season
in
London
,
she
go
to
Harrowgate
or
Cheltenham
for
the
summer
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
the
most
hospitable
and
jovial
of
old
vestal

and
have
be
a
beauty
in

<EOS>
(
all

we
very
well
know

)
<EOS>
She
be
a

esprit
,
and
a
dreadful
Radical
for
those

<EOS>
She
have
be

France
(
where
St.

they
say

an
unfortunate
passion
)
,
and
love

ever
after

french
novel
,
french
cookery
,
and
french
wine

<EOS>
She
read
Voltaire

and
have
rousseau
by
heart
;
talk
very
lightly
about
divorce

and
most
energetically
of
the
right
of
woman
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
picture
of
Mr.
Fox
in
every
room
in
the
house
:
when
that
statesman
be
in
opposition
,
I
be
not
sure
that
she
have
not
fling
a
main
with
him
;
and
when
he

office
,
she
take
great
credit
for
bring
over

him
Sir

his

although
Sir

would
have
come
over
himself
,
without
any
trouble
on

<EOS>
It
be
needless
to

that
Sir

be
bring

change
his
view
after

Whig
statesman

<EOS>
It
can
not
be
suppose
that
the
arrival

such
a

Rebecca

Queen

Crawley
,
and
her
gradual
establishment
in

Mrs.

I
say

could
not
pass
over
the
Hall
governess
without
make
every
inquiry
respect
her
history

character

<EOS>
there
be
always
the
good
understanding
between
the
servant
at
the
Rectory

<EOS>
there
be
always
a
good
glass
of
ale
in
the
kitchen
of
the
former
place
for
the

people

whose
ordinary
drink
be
very
small
 
and
,
indeed

the
Rector

lady
know
exactly
how
much
malt

to
every
barrel
of
Hall
beer
 
tie
of
relationship

between
the

domestic

as
between
their

and
through
these
channel
each
family
be
perfectly
well
acquaint

the
doing
of
the
other

<EOS>
that
,
by
the
way

may
be
set
down

I

<EOS>
present

I
have
the

(
epistolarily

to
introduce
to
her

<EOS>
my
two
friend
,
Miss
Tuffin
and
Miss

<EOS>
either
of
these
young

be
PERFECTLY
QUALIFIED
to
instruct
in
Greek
,
Latin
,
and
the
rudiment
of
Hebrew
;
in
mathematic
and
history
;
in
Spanish
,
french
,
italian
,
and
geography
;
in
music
,
vocal
and
instrumental
;
in
dancing
,
without
the
aid
of
a
master
;
and
in
the
element
of
natural
science
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
use
of
the
globe
both
be
proficient
.
 
<EOS>
in
addition
to
these
Miss
Tuffin
,
who
be
daughter
of
the
late
Reverend
Thomas
Tuffin
(
Fellow
of
Corpus
College
,
Cambridge
)
,
can
instruct
in
the
Syriac
language
,
and
the
element
of
constitutional
law
.
<EOS>
but
as
she
be
only
eighteen
year
of
age
,
and
of
exceedingly
pleasing
personal
appearance
,
perhaps
this
young
lady
may
be
objectionable
in
Sir
Huddleston
Fuddleston
's
family
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Letitia
Hawky

on

be

personally
well

favour

<EOS>
She
be

twenty
-
nine
;
her
face
be
much
pit
with
the
small

pox
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
halt
in
her
gait
,
red
hair
,
and
a
trifling
obliquity
of
vision
.
<EOS>
both
lady
be
endow

every
MORAL
and
RELIGIOUS
VIRTUE
.
 
<EOS>
Their
term
,
of

be

their

merit

<EOS>
with
my
most
grateful
respect

the
Reverend

I
have

<EOS>
Dear
Madam

Your
most
faithful
and
obedient
servant

Barbara
Pinkerton

<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
the
Miss
Sharp
,
whom
you
mention
as
governess
to
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
,
Bart
.
<EOS>
,
M.P.
,
be
a
pupil
of
mine
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
say
in
her
disfavour
.
<EOS>
though
her
appearance
be
disagreeable
,
we
can
not
control
the
operation
of
nature
:
and
though
her
parent
be
disreputable
(
her
father
be
a
painter
,
several
time
bankrupt
,
and
her
mother
,
as
I
have
since
learn
,
with
horror
,
a
dancer
at
the
Opera
)
;
yet
her
talent
be
considerable
,
and
I
can
not
regret
that
I
receive
her
out
of
CHARITY
.
 
<EOS>
My
dread
be
,
lest
the
principle
of
the
mother
 
who
be
represent
to
me
as
a
French
Countess
,
force
to
emigrate
in
the
late
revolutionary
horror
;
but
who
,
as
I
have
since
find
,
be
a
person
of
the
very
low
order
and
moral
 
should
at
any
time
prove
to
be
HEREDITARY
in
the
unhappy
young
woman
whom
I
take
as
AN
OUTCAST
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
principle
have
hitherto
be
correct
(
I
believe
)
,
and
I
be
sure
nothing
will
occur
to
injure
them
in
the
elegant
and
refined
circle
of
the
eminent
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Rebecca
Sharp
to
Miss
Amelia
Sedley
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
write
to
my
beloved
Amelia
for
these
many
week
past
,
for
what
news
be
there
to
tell
of
the
saying
and
doing
at
Humdrum
Hall
,
as
I
have
christen
it
;
and
what
do
you
care
whether
the
turnip
crop
be
good
or
bad
;
whether
the
fat
pig
weigh
thirteen
stone
or
fourteen
;
and
whether
the
beast
thrive
well
upon
mangelwurzel
?
<EOS>
every
day
since
I
last
write
have
be
like
its
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
before
breakfast
,
a
walk
with
Sir
Pitt
and
his
spud
;
after
breakfast
study
(
such
as
they
be
)
in
the
schoolroom
;
after
schoolroom
,
read
and
write
about
lawyer
,
lease
,
coal
-
mine
,
canal
,
with
Sir
Pitt
(
whose
secretary
I
be
become
)
;
after
dinner
,
Mr.
Crawley
's
discourse
on
the
baronet
's
backgammon
;
during
both
of
which
amusement
my
lady
look
on
with
equal
placidity
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
become
rather
more
interesting
by
be
ail
of
late
,
which
have
bring
a
new
visitor
to
the
Hall
,
in
the
person
of
a
young
doctor
.
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
,
young
woman
need
never
despair
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
doctor
give
a
certain
friend
of
yours
to
understand
that
,
if
she
choose
to
be
Mrs.
Glauber
,
she
be
welcome
to
ornament
the
surgery
!
<EOS>
I
tell
his
impudence
that
the
gilt
pestle
and
mortar
be
quite
ornament
enough
;
as
if
I
be
bear
,
indeed
,
to
be
a
country
surgeon
's
wife
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Glauber
go
home
seriously
indispose
at
his
rebuff
,
take
a
cool
draught
,
and
be
now
quite
cure
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
applaud
my
resolution
highly
;
he
would
be
sorry
to
lose
his
little
secretary
,
I
think
;
and
I
believe
the
old
wretch
like
me
as
much
as
it
be
in
his
nature
to
like
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Marry
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
with
a
country
apothecary
,
after
   
no
,
no
,
one
can
not
so
soon
forget
old
association
,
about
which
I
will
talk
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
return
to
Humdrum
Hall

<EOS>
for
some

past
it
be
Humdrum
Hall

My

better
say

her

<EOS>
She
look
very
apoplectic

the
dear
soul
;
no
wonder
her

be
anxious
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
see
them
struggle
to
settle
her

to
hand
her
coffee
!

"
when

My

<EOS>
when

our

be
throw
open

and
for
a
month
,
at

,
you
would
fancy
<EOS>
old
Sir
Walpole
be
come
to
life
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
dinner

party

and
drive
out

<EOS>
We
have
wax
candle
in

<EOS>
Lady
Crawley
be
make
to
put
on
the
bright
pea

green
in
her
wardrobe

and
my
pupil
leave
off
their
thick
shoe
and
tight
old
tartan
pelisse

and
wear
silk
stocking
and
muslin
frock
,
as
fashionable
baronet

daughter
should

<EOS>
Rose
come
in
yesterday
in
a
sad
plight
 
<EOS>
the
Wiltshire
sow
(
an
enormous
pet
of
her
)
run
her
down
,
and
destroy
a
most
lovely
flower
lilac
silk
dress
by
dance
over
it
 
<EOS>
have
this
happen
a
week
ago
<EOS>
,
Sir
Pitt
would
have
swear
frightfully
,
have
box
the
poor
wretch
's
ear
,
and
put
her
upon
bread
and
water
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
all
he
say
be
,
"
I
will
serve
you
out
,
Miss
,
when
your
aunt
be
go
,
"
and
laugh
off
the
accident
as
quite
trivial
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
hope
his
wrath
will
have
pass
away
before
Miss
Crawley
's
departure
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
,
for
Miss
Rose
's
sake
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
what
a
charming
reconciler
and
peacemaker
money
be
!
  
<EOS>
another
admirable
effect
of
Miss
Crawley
and
her
seventy
thousand
pound
be
to
be
see
in
the
conduct
of
the
two
brother
Crawley
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
baronet
and
the
rector
,
not
our
brother
 
but
the
former
,
who
hate
each
other
all
the
year
round
,
become
quite
loving
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
you
last
year
how
the
abominable
horse
-
race
rector
be
in
the
habit
of
preach
clumsy
sermon
at
us
at
church
,
and
how
Sir
Pitt
snore
in
answer
.
 
<EOS>
when
Miss
Crawley
arrive
there
be
no
such
thing
as
quarrel
hear
of
 
<EOS>
the
Hall
visit
the
Rectory
,
and
vice
versa
 
<EOS>
the
parson
and
the
Baronet
talk
about
the
pig
and
the
poacher
,
and
the
county
business
<EOS>
,
in
the
most
affable
manner
,
and
without
quarrel
in
their
cup
,
I
believe
 
indeed
Miss
Crawley
will
not
hear
of
their
quarrelling
,
and
vow
that
she
will
leave
her
money
to
the
Shropshire
Crawleys
if
they
offend
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
be
clever
people
,
those
Shropshire
Crawleys
,
they
may
have
it
all
,
I
think
;
but
the
Shropshire
Crawley
be
a
clergyman
like
his
Hampshire
cousin
,
and
mortally
offend
Miss
Crawley
(
who
have
flee
thither
in
a
fit
of
rage
against
her
impracticable
brother
)
by
some
strait
-
lace
notion
of
morality
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
prayer
in
the
house
,
I
believe
.
  
<EOS>
Our
sermon
book
be
shut
up
when
Miss
Crawley
arrive
,
and
Mr.
Pitt
,
whom
she
abominate
,
find
it
convenient
to
go
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
young
dandy
 
"
blood
,
"
I
believe
,
be
the
term
 
<EOS>
Captain
Crawley
make
his
appearance
,
and
I
suppose
you
will
like
to
know
what
sort
of
a
person
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
he
be
a
very
large
young
dandy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
six
foot
high
,
and
speak
with
a
great
voice
;
and
swear
a
great
deal
;
and
order
about
the
servant
,
who
all
adore
him
nevertheless
;
for
he
be
very
generous
of
his
money
,
and
the
domestic
will
do
anything
for
him
.
<EOS>
last
week
the
keeper
almost
kill
a
bailiff
and
his
man
who
come
down
from
London
to
arrest
the
Captain
,
and
who
be
find
lurk
about
the
Park
wall
 
<EOS>
they
beat
them
,
duck
them
,
and
be
go
to
shoot
them
for
poacher
,
but
the
baronet
interfere
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
a
hearty
contempt
for
his
father
,
I
can
see
,
and
call
him
an
old
PUT
,
an
old
SNOB
,
an
old
CHAW
-
BACON
,
and
numberless
other
pretty
name
.
 
<EOS>

He

live
with

Squires
of
the
county
,
ask
whom
he
please

and
Sir

Miss

Shall

<EOS>
You

It

<EOS>
when
Miss
Rebecca
Sharp
write
to
her
beloved
friend
the
account
of
the
little
ball
at
Queen
's
Crawley
,
and
the
manner
in
which
,
for
the
first
time
,
Captain
Crawley
have
distinguish
her
,
she
do
not

strange
to
relate

accurate
account

<EOS>
the
Captain

great
number

<EOS>
the
Captain
have
meet
her
in

half

score
of
walk
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
light
upon
her
in
a
half

hundred
of
corridor
and
passage
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
hang
over
her
piano
twenty
time
of
an
evening
(
my
Lady
be
now
upstairs
,
be
ill
,
and
nobody
heed
her
)
as
Miss
Sharp
sing
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
write
her
note
(
the
good
that
the
great
blundering
dragoon
could
devise
and
spell
;
but
dulness
get
on
as
well
as
any

quality

<EOS>
but
when
he
put
the
first
of
the
note
into
the
leave
of
the
song
she
be
singe

the
little
governess
,
rise
and
look
him
steadily
in
the
face
,
take
up
the
triangular
missive
daintily
,
and
wave
it
about
as
if
it
be
a
cocked

and
she

advance
to
the
enemy
,
pop
the
note
into
the
fire
,
and
make
him
a
very
low
curtsey
,

go
back
to
her
place

and
begin
to
sing
away
again
more
merrily

<EOS>
"
what
be
that

"
say
Miss

,
interrupt
in
her
after

dinner
doze
by
the
stoppage

the
music

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
false
note

"
Miss
Sharp
say
with
a
laugh
;
and
Rawdon
Crawley
fume
with
rage
and
mortification
.
  
<EOS>
see
the
evident
partiality
of
Miss
Crawley
for
the
new
governess
,
how
good
it
be
of
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
not
to
be
jealous
,
and
to
welcome
the
young
lady
to
the
Rectory
,
and
not
only
her
,
but
Rawdon
Crawley
,
her
husband
's
rival

Old
Maid

five

<EOS>
They
become
very
fond

Mrs.
Crawley

<EOS>
He
give
up
hunting
;
he
decline
entertainment
at
Fuddleston
:
he
would
not
dine
with
the
mess
of
the
depot
at
Mudbury
:
<EOS>
his
great
pleasure
be
to
stroll
over
to
Crawley
parsonage

whither
Miss
Crawley
come
too
;
and
as
their
mamma
be
ill

why
not
the
child
with
Miss
Sharp
?
<EOS>
so
the
child
(
little
dear

)
come
with
Miss
Sharp
;
and
of
an
evening
some
of
the
party
would
walk
back
together

<EOS>
not
Miss
Crawley
 
<EOS>
she
prefer
her
carriage

the
walk
over

Rectory
field

in

little
park
wicket

through
the
dark
plantation
,
and
up
the
checker
avenue
to
Queen

Crawley

be
charm
in
the
moonlight
to
two
such
lover
of
the
picturesque
as
the
Captain

Miss
Rebecca

<EOS>
"

Miss

"
You

Miss

the
smell
of
a
cigar
out

door
beyond
everything

and
she
just
taste
one
too

in

pretty
way
possible

and
give
a
little
puff
,
and
a
little
scream

and
a
little
giggle

and
restore
the
delicacy
to
the
Captain

who
twirl
his
moustache
,
and
straightway
puff
it
into
a
blaze
that
glow
quite
red
in
the
dark
plantation

and
swear

<EOS>
aw
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
fine
segaw

aw

"
for
his
intellect
and
conversation
be
alike
brilliant

become
to
a
heavy
young
dragoon

<EOS>
Old
Sir
Pitt

who
be
take
his
pipe
and
beer
,
and
talk
to
John
Horrocks
about
a
"
ship
"
that
be
to
be
kill
,
espy
the
pair
so
occupied
from
his
study
-
window
,
and
with
dreadful
oath
swear
that
if
it
be
not
for
Miss
Crawley
,
he
would
take
Rawdon
and
bundle
un
out
of
door
,
like
a
rogue

he
be

<EOS>
"
He
be
a
bad'n

sure
enough

"
Mr.
Horrocks
remark
;

and
his
man
Flethers
be
wuss
,
and
have
make
such
a
row
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
about
the
dinner
and
hale
,
as
no
lord
would
make
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
<EOS>
Miss
Sharp
be
a
match
for'n
,
Sir
Pitt

"
he
add
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
in
truth
,
she
be
 
for
father
and
son
too
.
   
<EOS>
quite
a
sentimental
chapter
 
<EOS>
We
must
now
take
leave
of
Arcadia
,
and
those
amiable
people
practise
the
rural
virtue
there
,
and
travel
back
to
London
,
to
inquire
what
have
become
of
Miss
Amelia
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
care
a
fig
for
her
,
"
write
some
unknown
correspondent
with
a
pretty
little
handwriting
and
a
pink
seal
to
her
note
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
fade
and
insipid
,
"
and
add
some
more
kind
remark
in
this
strain
,
which
I
should
never
have
repeat
at
all
,
but
that
they
be
in
truth
prodigiously
complimentary
to
the
young
lady
whom
they
concern
.
  
<EOS>
have
the
beloved
reader
,
in
his
experience
of
society
,
never
hear
similar
remark
by
good
-
natured
female
friend
;
who
always
wonder
what
you
CAN
see
in
Miss
Smith
that
be
so
fascinating
;
or
what
COULD
induce
Major
Jones
to
propose
for
that
silly
insignificant
simper
Miss
Thompson
,
who
have
nothing
but
her
wax
-
doll
face
to
recommend
her
?
<EOS>
what
be
there
in
a
pair
of
pink
cheek
and
blue
eye
forsooth
?
<EOS>
these
dear
Moralists
ask
,
and
hint
wisely
that
the
gift
of
genius
,
the
accomplishment
of
the
mind
,
the
mastery
of
Mangnall
's
Questions
,
and
a
ladylike
knowledge
of
botany
and
geology
,
the
knack
of
make
poetry
,
the
power
of
rattle
sonatas
in
the
Herz
-
manner
,
and
so
forth
,
be
far
more
valuable
endowment
for
a
female
,
than
those
fugitive
charm
which
a
few
year
will
inevitably
tarnish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
edifying
to
hear
woman
speculate
upon
the
worthlessness
and
the
duration
of
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
virtue
be
a
much
fine
thing
,
and
those
hapless
creature
who
suffer
under
the
misfortune
of
good
look
ought
to
be
continually
put
in
mind
of
the
fate
which
await
them
;
and
though
,
very
likely
,
the
heroic
female
character
which
lady
admire
be
a
more
glorious
and
beautiful
object
than
the
kind
,
fresh
,
smile
,
artless
,
tender
little
domestic
goddess
,
whom
man
be
inclined
to
worship
 
yet
the
latter
and
inferior
sort
of
woman
must
have
this
consolation
 
that
the
man
do
admire
them
after
all
;
and
that
,
in
spite
of
all
our
kind
friend
'
warning
and
protest
,
we
go
on
in
our
desperate
error
and
folly
,
and
shall
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
for
my
own
part
,
though
I
have
be
repeatedly
tell
by
person
for
whom
I
have
the
great
respect
,
that
Miss
Brown
be
an
insignificant
chit
,
and
Mrs.
White
have
nothing
but
her
petit
minois
chiffonne
,
and
Mrs.
Black
have
not
a
word
to
say
for
herself
;
yet
I
know
that
I
have
have
the
most
delightful
conversation
with
Mrs.
Black
(
of
course
,
my
dear
Madam
,
they
be
inviolable
)
<EOS>
:
I
see
all
the
man
in
a
cluster
round
Mrs.
White
's
chair
:
all
the
young
fellow
battle
to
dance
with
Miss
Brown
;
and
so
I
be
tempt
to
think
that
to
be
despise
by
her
sex
be
a
very
great
compliment
to
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
in
Amelia
's
society
do
this
for
her
very
satisfactorily
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
there
be
scarcely
any
point
upon
which
the
Misses
Osborne
,
George
's
sister
,
and
the
Mesdemoiselles
Dobbin
agree
so
well
as
in
their
estimate
of
her
very
trifling
merit
:
and
their
wonder
that
their
brother
could
find
any
charm
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
kind
to
her
,
"
the
Misses
Osborne
say
,
a
pair
of
fine
black
-
browe
young
lady
who
have
have
the
good
of
governess
,
master
,
and
milliner
;
and
they
treat
her
with
such
extreme
kindness
and
condescension
,
and
patronise
her
so
insufferably
,
that
the
poor
little
thing
be
in
fact
perfectly
dumb
in
their
presence
,
and
to
all
outward
appearance
as
stupid
as
they
think
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
effort
to
like
them
,
as
in
duty
bind
,
and
as
sister
of
her
future
husband
.
 
<EOS>
She
pass
"
long
morning
"
with
them
 
the
most
dreary
and
serious
of
forenoon
.
 
<EOS>
She
drive
out
solemnly
in
their
great
family
coach
with
them
,
and
Miss
Wirt
their
governess
,
that
raw
-
bone
Vestal
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
her
to
the
ancient
concert
by
way
of
a
treat
,
and
to
the
oratorio
,
and
to
<EOS>
St.
Paul
's
to
see
the
charity
child
,
where
in
such
terror
be
she
of
her
friend
,
she
almost
do
not
dare
be
affect
by
the
hymn
the
child
sing
.
 
<EOS>
Their
house
be
comfortable
;
their
papa
's
table
rich
and
handsome
;
their
society
solemn
and
genteel
;
their
self
-
respect
prodigious
;
they
have
the
good
pew
at
the
Foundling
:
all
their
habit
be
pompous
and
orderly
,
and
all
their
amusement
intolerably
dull
and
decorous
.
<EOS>
after
every
one
of
her
visit
(
<EOS>
and
oh
how
glad
she
be
when
they
be
over
!
)
<EOS>
Miss
Osborne
and
Miss
Maria
Osborne
,
and
Miss
Wirt
,
the
vestal
governess

ask
each
other

what
could
George
find
in
that
creature

<EOS>
how
be
this
?
<EOS>
some
carp
reader
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
Amelia
,
who
have
such
a
number
of
friend
at
school
,
and
be
so
beloved
there
,
come
out
into
the
world
and
be
spurn
by
her
discriminate
sex
?
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
there
be
no
man
at
Miss
Pinkerton
's
establishment
except
the
old
dancing
-
master
;
and
you
would
not
have
have
the
girl
fall
out
about
him
?
<EOS>
when
George
,
their
handsome
brother
,
run
off
directly
after
breakfast
,
and
dine
from
home
half
-
a
-
dozen
time
a
week
,
no
wonder
the
neglect
sister
feel
a
little
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
when
young
Bullock
(
of
the
firm
of
Hulker
,
Bullock
&
Co.
,
Bankers
,
Lombard
Street
)
,
who
have
be
make
up
to
Miss
Maria
the
last
two
season
,
actually
ask
Amelia
to
dance
the
cotillon
,
could
you
expect
that
the
former
young
lady
should
be
pleased
?
<EOS>
and
yet
she
say
she
be
,
like
an
artless
forgiving
creature
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
delighted
you
like
dear
Amelia
,
"
she
say
quite
eagerly
to
Mr.
Bullock
after
the
dance
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
engage
to
my
brother
George
;
there
be
not
much
in
her
,
but
she
be
the
best
-
natured
and
most
unaffected
young
creature
:
<EOS>
at
home
we
be
all
so
fond
of
her
.
"
<EOS>
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
who
can
calculate
the
depth
of
affection
express
in
that
enthusiastic
so
?
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wirt
and
these
two
affectionate
young
woman
so
earnestly
and
frequently
impress
upon
George
Osborne
's
mind
the
enormity
of
the
sacrifice
he
be
make
,
and
his
romantic
generosity
in
throw
himself
away
upon
Amelia
,
<EOS>
that
I
be
not
sure
but
that
he
really
think
he
be
one
of
the
most
deserving
character
in
the
british
army
,
and
give
himself
up
to
be
love
with
a
good
deal
of
easy
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
somehow
,
although
he
leave
home
every
morning
,
as
be
state
,
and
dine
abroad
six
day
in
the
week
,
when
his
sister
believe
the
infatuated
youth
to
be
at
Miss
Sedley
's
apron
-
string
:
he
be
not
always
with
Amelia
,
whilst
the
world
suppose
him
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
on
more
occasion
than
one
,
when
Captain
Dobbin
call
to
look
for
his
friend
,
Miss
Osborne
(
who
be
very
attentive
to
the
Captain
,
and
anxious
to
hear
his
military
story
,
and
to
know
about
the
health
of
his
dear
Mamma
)
,
would
laughingly
point
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
,
and
say
,
"
oh
,
you
must
go
to
the
Sedleys
'
to
ask
for
George
;
we
never
see
him
from
morning
till
night
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
kind
of
speech
the
Captain
would
laugh
in
rather
an
absurd
constrain
manner
,
and
turn
off
the
conversation
,
like
a
consummate
man
of
the
world
,
to
some
topic
of
general
interest
,
such
as
the
Opera
,
the
Prince
's
last
ball
at
Carlton
House
,
or
the
weather
 
that
blessing
to
society
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
an
innocent
it
be
,
that
pet
of
yours
,
"
Miss
Maria
would
then
say
to
Miss
Jane
,
upon
the
Captain
's
departure
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
how
he
blush
at
the
mention
of
poor
George
on
duty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
<EOS>
Frederick
Bullock
have
not
some
of
his
modesty

Maria

"
reply
the
eld
sister
,
with
a
toss
of
he
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Modesty
!
 
<EOS>
Awkwardness
you
mean
,
Jane

<EOS>
I
do
not
want
Frederick
to
trample
a
hole
in
my
muslin
frock

as
Captain
Dobbin
do
in
yours
at
Mrs.
Perkins
'
.
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
in
your
frock
,
he
,
he
!
 
<EOS>
how
could
he
?
<EOS>
be
not
he
dance
with
Amelia
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
when
Captain
Dobbin
blush
so
,
and
look
so
awkward
,
he
remember
a
circumstance
of
which
he
do
not
think
it
be
necessary
to
inform
the
young
lady
,
viz
.
,
that
he
have
be
call
at
Mr.
Sedley
's
house
already
,
on
the
pretence
of
see
George
,
of
course
,
and
George
be
not
there
,
only
poor
little
Amelia
,
with
rather
a
sad
wistful
face
,
seat
near
the
drawing
-
room
window
,
who
,
after
some
very
trifling
stupid
talk
,
venture
to
ask
,
be
there
any
truth
in
the
report
that
the
regiment
be
soon
to
be
order
abroad
;
and
have
Captain
Dobbin
see
Mr.
Osborne
that
day
?
  
<EOS>
the
regiment
be
not
order
abroad
as
yet
;
and
Captain
Dobbin
have
not
see
George
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
with
his
sister
,
most
likely
,
"
the
Captain
say
.
<EOS>
"
Should
he
go
and
fetch
the
truant
?
"
 
<EOS>
so
she
give
him
her
hand
kindly
and
gratefully
:
and
he
cross
the
square
;
and
she
wait
and
wait
,
but
George
never
come
.
  
<EOS>
poor
little
tender
heart
!
<EOS>
and
so
it
go
on
hope
and
beat
,
and
longing
and
trusting
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
it
be
not
much
of
a
life
to
describe
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
of
what
you
call
incident
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
only
one
feel
all
day
 
when
will
he
come
?
<EOS>
only
one
think
to
sleep
and
wake
upon
.
<EOS>
I
believe
George
be
play
billiard
with
Captain
Cannon
in
Swallow
Street
at
the
time
when
Amelia
be
ask
Captain
Dobbin
about
him
;
for
George
be
a
jolly
sociable
fellow
,
and
excellent
in
all
game
of
skill
.
  
<EOS>
once
,
after
three
day
of
absence
,
Miss
Amelia
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
actually
invade
the
osborne
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
leave
our
brother
to
come
to
us
?
"
say
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
have
a
quarrel
,
Amelia
?
<EOS>
do
tell
us
!
"
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
there
have
be
no
quarrel
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
could
quarrel
with
him
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
with
her
eye
fill
with
tear
.
<EOS>
She
only
come
over
to
 
to
see
her
dear
friend
;
they
have
not
meet
for
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
day
she
be
so
perfectly
stupid
and
awkward
,
that
the
Misses
Osborne
and
their
governess
,
who
stare
after
her
as
she
go
sadly
away
,
wonder
more
than
ever
what
George
could
see
in
poor
little
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
how
be
she
to
bare
that
timid
little
heart
for
the
inspection
of
those
young
lady
with
their
bold
black
eye
?
<EOS>
It
be
good
that
it
should
shrink
and
hide
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
Misses
Osborne
be
excellent
critic
of
a
Cashmere
shawl
,
or
a
pink
satin
slip
;
and
when
Miss
Turner
have
her
dye
purple
,
and
make
into
a
spencer
;
and
when
Miss
Pickford
have
her
ermine
tippet
twist
into
a
muff
and
trimming
,
I
warrant
you
the
change
do
not
escape
the
two
intelligent
young
woman
before
mention
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
thing

look
you

of
a
fine
texture

there

<EOS>
Miss
Sedley
be
not

and
I
say
it
be
out
of
the
rule
of
all
proportion
to
draw
a
violet
of
the
size
of
a
double
dahlia
.
  
<EOS>
no

indeed

the
life

a
good
young

who
be

the
paternal
nest

last
name
mention
in
her
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
have
see
a
man
so
beautiful
or
so
clever
:
such
a
figure
on
horseback
:
<EOS>
such
a
dancer
:
such
a
hero
in
general
.
<EOS>
talk
of
the
Prince
's
bow
!
<EOS>
what
be
it
to
George
's
?
<EOS>
She
have
see
Mr.
Brummell
,
whom
everybody
praise
so
.
 
<EOS>
compare
such
a
person
as
that
to
her
George
!
<EOS>
not
amongst
all
the
beaux
at
the
Opera
(
and
there
be
beaux
in
those
day
with
actual
opera
hat
)
<EOS>
be
there
any
one
to
equal
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
only
good
enough
to
be
a
fairy
prince
;
and
oh
,
what
magnanimity
to
stoop
to
such
a
humble
Cinderella
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pinkerton
would
have
try
to
check
this
blind
devotion
very
likely
,
have
she
be
Amelia
's
confidante
;
but
not
with
much
success
,
depend
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
nature
and
instinct
of
some
woman
.
 
<EOS>
some
be
make
to
scheme
,
and
some
to
love
;
and
I
wish
any
respected
bachelor
that
read
this
may
take
the
sort
that
good
like
him
.
  
<EOS>
while
under
this
overpower
impression
,
Miss
Amelia
neglect
her
twelve
dear
friend
at
Chiswick
most
cruelly
,
as
such
selfish
people
commonly
will
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
<EOS>
but
this
subject
,
of
course
,
to
think
about
;
and
Miss
Saltire
be
too
cold
for
a
confidante
,
and
she
could
not
bring
her
mind
to
tell
Miss
Swartz
,
the
woolly
-
haired
young
heiress
from
St.
Kitt
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
little
Laura
Martin
home
for
the
holiday
;
and
my
belief
be
,
she
make
a
confidante
of
her
,
and
promise
that
Laura
should
come
and
live
with
her
when
she
be
married
,
and
give
Laura
a
great
deal
of
information
regard
the
passion
of
love
,
which
must
have
be
singularly
useful
and
novel
to
that
little
person
.
 
<EOS>
alas
,
alas
!
 
<EOS>
I
fear
poor
Emmy
have
not
a
well
-
regulate
mind
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
her
parent
do
,
not
to
keep
this
little
heart
from
beat
so
fast
?
 
<EOS>
Old
Sedley
do
not
seem
much
to
notice
matter
.
<EOS>
He
be
graver
of
late
,
and
his
City
affair
absorb
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sedley
be
of
so
easy
and
uninquisitive
a
nature
that
she
be
not
even
jealous
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Jos
be
away
,
be
besiege
by
an
irish
widow
at
Cheltenham
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
have
the
house
to
herself
 
ah
!
<EOS>
too
much
to
herself
<EOS>
sometimes
 
not
that
she
ever
doubt
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
George
must
be
at
the
Horse
Guards
;
and
he
can
not
always
get
leave
from
Chatham
;
and
he
must
see
his
friend
and
sister
,
and
mingle
in
society
when
in
town
(
he
,
such
an
ornament
to
every
society
!
)
;
and
when
he
be
with
the
regiment
,
he
be
too
tired
to
write
long
letter
.
<EOS>
I
know
where
she
keep
that
packet
<EOS>
she
have
 
and
can
steal
in
and
out
of
her
chamber
like
Iachimo
 
like
Iachimo
?
 
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
bad
part
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
act
Moonshine
,
and
peep
harmless
into
the
bed
where
faith
and
beauty
and
innocence
lie
dream
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
Osborne
's
be
short
and
soldierlike
letter
,
it
must
be
confess
,
that
be
Miss
Sedley
's
letter
to
Mr.
Osborne
to
be
publish
,
we
should
have
to
extend
this
novel
to
such
a
multiplicity
of
volume
as
not
the
most
sentimental
reader
could
support
;
that
she
not
only
fill
sheet
of
large
paper
,
but
cross
them
with
the
most
astonishing
perverseness
;
that
she
write
whole
page
out
of
poetry
-
book
without
the
least
pity
;
that
she
underline
word
and
passage
with
quite
a
frantic
emphasis
;
and
,
in
fine
,
give
the
usual
token
of
her
condition
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
heroine
.
<EOS>
Her
letter
be
full
of
repetition
.
 
<EOS>
She
write
rather
doubtful
grammar
sometimes
,
and
in
her
verse
take
all
sort
of
liberty
with
the
metre
.
 
<EOS>
but
oh
,
madame
,
if
you
be
not
allow
to
touch
the
heart
sometimes
in
spite
of
syntax
,
and
be
not
to
be
love
until
you
all
know
the
difference
between
trimeter
and
tetrameter
,
may
all
Poetry
go
to
the
deuce
,
and
every
schoolmaster
perish
miserably
!
   
<EOS>
Sentimental
and
otherwise
 
<EOS>
I
fear
the
gentleman
to
whom
Miss
Amelia
's
letter
be
address
be
rather
an
obdurate
critic
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
number
of
note
follow
Lieutenant
Osborne
about
the
country
,
that
he
become
almost
ashamed
of
the
joke
of
his
mess
-
room
companion
regard
them
,
and
order
his
servant
never
to
deliver
them
except
at
his
private
apartment
.
<EOS>
He
be
see
light
his
cigar
with
one
,
to
the
horror
of
Captain
Dobbin
,
who
,
it
be
my
belief
,
would
have
give
a
bank
-
note
for
the
document
.
  
<EOS>
for
some
time
George
strove
to
keep
the
liaison
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
woman
in
the
case
,
that
he
admit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
not
the
first
either
,
"
say
Ensign
Spooney
to
ensign
Stubble
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
Osborne
be
a
devil
of
a
fellow
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
judge
's
daughter
at
Demerara
go
almost
mad
about
him
;
then
there
be
that
beautiful
quadroon
girl
,
Miss
Pye
,
at
St.
Vincent
's
,
you
know
;
and
since
he
be
be
home
,
they
say
he
be
a
regular
Don
Giovanni
,
by
Jove
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stubble
and
Spooney
think
that
to
be
a
"
regular
Don
Giovanni
,
by
Jove
"
be
one
of
the
fine
quality
a
man
could
possess
,
and
Osborne
's
reputation
be
prodigious
amongst
the
young
man
of
the
regiment
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
famous
in
field
-
sport
,
famous
at
a
song
,
famous
on
parade
;
free
with
his
money
,
which
be
bountifully
supply
by
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
His
coat
be
better
make
than
any
man
's
in
the
regiment
,
and
he
have
more
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
adore
by
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
drink
more
than
any
officer
of
the
whole
mess
,
include
old
Heavytop
,
the
colonel
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
spar
better
than
Knuckles
,
the
private
(
who
would
have
be
a
corporal
but
for
his
drunkenness
,
and
who
have
be
in
the
prize
-
ring
)
;
and
be
the
good
batter
and
bowler
,
out
and
out
,
of
the
regimental
club
.
<EOS>
He
ride
his
own
horse
,
Greased
lightning
,
and
win
the
Garrison
cup
at
Quebec
race
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
other
people
besides
Amelia
who
worship
him
.
 
<EOS>
Stubble
and
Spooney
think
him
a
sort
of
Apollo
;
Dobbin
take
him
to
be
an
admirable
Crichton
;
and
Mrs.
Major
O'Dowd
acknowledge
he
be
an
elegant
young
fellow
,
and
put
her
in
mind
of
Fitzjurld
Fogarty
,
Lord
Castlefogarty
's
second
son
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Stubble
and
spooney
and
the
rest
indulge
in
most
romantic
conjecture
regard
this
female
correspondent
of
<EOS>
Osborne
's
 
opine
that
it
be
a
Duchess
in
London
who
be
in
love
with
him
 
or
that
it
be
a
General
's
daughter
,
who
be
engage
to
somebody
else
,
and
madly
attach
to
him
 
or
that
it
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
's
lady
,
who
propose
four
horse
and
an
elopement
 
or
that
it
be
some
other
victim
of
a
passion
delightfully
exciting
,
romantic
,
and
disgraceful
to
all
party
,
on
none
of
which
conjecture
<EOS>
would
osborne
throw
the
least
light
,
leave
his
young
admirer
and
friend
to
invent
and
arrange
their
whole
history
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
real
state
of
the
case
would
never
have
be
know
at
all
in
the
regiment
but
for
Captain
Dobbin
's
indiscretion
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
eat
his
breakfast
one
day
in
the
mess
-
room
,
while
Cackle
,
the
assistant
-
surgeon
,
and
the
two
above
-
name
worthy
be
speculate
upon
Osborne
's
intrigue
 
Stubble
hold
out
that
the
lady
be
a
Duchess
about
Queen
Charlotte
's
court
,
and
<EOS>
Cackle
vow
she
be
an
opera
-
singer
of
the
bad
reputation
.
<EOS>
at
this
idea
Dobbin
become
so
moved
,
that
though
his
mouth
be
full
of
egg
and
bread
-
and
-
butter
at
the
time
,
and
though
he
ought
not
to
have
speak
at
all
,
yet
he
could
not
help
blurt
out
,
"
Cackle
,
you
be
a
stupid
fool
.
<EOS>
You
be
always
talk
nonsense
and
scandal
.
 
<EOS>
Osborne
be
not
go
to
run
off
with
a
Duchess
or
ruin
a
milliner
.
<EOS>
Miss
Sedley
be
one
of
the
most
charming
young
woman
that
ever
live

<EOS>
He
be
be

her

so
long
;

the

well
not

so

"
<EOS>
with
which

turn
exceedingly
red

Dobbin
cease

almost
choke
himself
with
a
cup
of
tea

the
Lieutenant

an
appropriate
speech
over
a
glass
of
whisky

toddy
that
evening
,
and
he
go
home
perfectly
furious
to
quarrel
with
Dobbin
(
who
have
decline

you
could
have
see
poor
little
<EOS>
Miss
Emmy
's
face
<EOS>
when
she
ask
me
about
you
the
other
day
,
you
would
have
pitch
those
billiard
-
ball
to
the
deuce
.
 
<EOS>
go
and
comfort
her
,
<EOS>
you
rascal
.
 
<EOS>
go
and
write
her
a
long
letter
.
 
<EOS>
do
something
to
make
her
happy
;
a
very
little
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
be
d
 
<EOS>
d
fond
of
me
,
"
the
Lieutenant
say
,
with
a
self
-
satisfy
air
;
and
go
off
to
finish
the
evening
with
some
jolly
fellow
in
the
mess
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
meanwhile
,
in
Russell
Square
,
be
look
at
the
moon
,
which
be
shine
upon
that
peaceful
spot
,
as
well
as
upon
the
square
of
the
Chatham
barrack
,
where
Lieutenant
Osborne
be
quarter
,
and
think
to
herself
how
her
hero
be
employ
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
visit
the
sentry
,
think
she
;
perhaps
he
be
bivouac
;
perhaps
he
be
attend
the
couch
of
a
wound
comrade
,
or
study
the
art
of
war
up
in
his
own
desolate
chamber
.
<EOS>
and
her
kind
thought
speed
away
as
if
they
be
angel
and
have
wing
,
and
fly
down
the
river
to
Chatham
and
Rochester
,
strove
to
peep
into
the
barrack
where
George
be
.
.
.
.
<EOS>
all
thing
consider
,
I
think
it
be
<EOS>
as
well
the
gate
be
shut
,
and
the
sentry
allow
no
one
to
pass
;
so
that
the
poor
little
white
-
robe
angel
could
not
hear
the
song
those
young
fellow
be
roar
over
the
whisky
-
punch
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
after
the
little
conversation
at
Chatham
barrack
,
young
Osborne
,
to
show
that
he
would
be
as
good
as
his
word
,
prepare
to
go
to
town
,
thereby
incur
Captain
Dobbin
's
applause
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
like
to
make
her
a
little
present
,
"
Osborne
say
to
his
friend
in
confidence
,
"
only
I
be
quite
out
of
cash
until
my
father
tip
up
.
"
<EOS>
but
Dobbin
would
not
allow
this
good
nature
and
generosity
to
be
balk
,
and
so
accommodate
Mr.
Osborne
with
a
few
pound
note
,
which
the
latter
take
after
a
little
faint
scruple
.
  
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
he
would
have
buy
something
very
handsome
for
Amelia
;
only
,
get
off
the
coach
in
Fleet
Street
,
he
be
attract
by
a
handsome
shirt
-
pin
in
a
jeweller
's
window
,
which
he
could
not
resist
;
and
have
pay
for
that
,
have
very
little
money
to
spare
for
indulge
in
any
further
exercise
of
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
never
mind
:
you
may
be
sure
it
be
not
his
present
Amelia
want
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
Russell
Square
,
her
face
light
up
as
if
he
have
be
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
care
,
fear
,
tear
,
timid
misgiving
,
sleepless
fancy
of
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
many
day
and
night
,
be
forget
,
under
one
moment
's
influence
of
that
familiar
,
irresistible
smile
.
 
<EOS>
He
beam
on
her
from
the
drawing
-
room
door
 
magnificent
,
with
ambrosial
whisker
,
like
a
god
.
<EOS>
Sambo
,
whose
face
as
he
announce
Captain
Osbin
<EOS>
(
have
confer
a
brevet
rank
on
that
young
officer
)
blaze
with
a
sympathetic
grin
,
see
the
little
girl
start
,
and
flush
,
and
jump
up
from
her
watching
-
place
in
the
window
;
and
Sambo
retreat
:
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
the
door
be
shut
,
she
go
flutter
to
Lieutenant
George
Osborne
's
heart
as
if
it
be
the
only
natural
home
for
her
to
nestle
in
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
thou
poor
pant
little
soul
!
 
<EOS>
the
very
fine
tree
in
the
whole
forest
,
with
the
straight
stem
,
and
the
strong
arm
,
and
the
thick
foliage
,
wherein
you
choose
to
build
and
coo
,
may
be
mark
,
for
what
you
know
,
and
may
be
down
with
a
crash
ere
long
.
 
<EOS>
what
an
old
,
old
simile
that
be
,
between
man
and
timber
!
  
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
George
kiss
her
very
kindly
on
her
forehead
and
glisten
eye
,
and
be
very
gracious
and
good
;
and
she
think
his
diamond
shirt
-
pin
(
which
she
have
not
know
him
to
wear
before
)
<EOS>
the
pretty
ornament
ever
see
.
  
<EOS>
the
observant
reader
,
who
have
mark
our
young
Lieutenant
's
previous
behaviour
,
and
have
preserve
our
report
of
the
brief
conversation
which
he
have
just
have
with
Captain
Dobbin
,
have
possibly
come
to
certain
conclusion
regard
the
character
of
Mr.
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
some
cynical
Frenchman
have
say
that
there
be
two
party
to
a
love
-
transaction
:
the
one
who
love
and
the
other
who
condescend
to
be
so
treat
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
love
be
occasionally
on
the
man
's
side
;
perhaps
on
the
lady
's
.
<EOS>
perhaps
some
infatuate
swain
have
ere
this
mistaken
insensibility
for
modesty
,
dulness
for
maiden
reserve
,
mere
vacuity
for
sweet
bashfulness
,
and
a
goose
,
in
a
word
,
for
a
swan
.
<EOS>
perhaps
some
beloved
female
subscriber
have
array
an
ass
in
the
splendour
and
glory
of
her
imagination
;
admire
his
dulness
as
manly
simplicity
;
worship
his
selfishness
as
manly
superiority
;
treat
his
stupidity
as
majestic
gravity
,
and
use
him
as
the
brilliant
fairy
Titania
do
a
certain
weaver
at
Athens
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
see
such
comedy
of
error
go
on
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
certain
,
that
Amelia
believe
her
lover
to
be
one
of
the
most
gallant
and
brilliant
man
in
the
empire
:
and
it
be
possible
<EOS>
Lieutenant
Osborne
think
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
wild
:
how
many
young
man
be
;
and
do
not
girl
like
a
rake
better
than
a
milksop
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
sow
his
wild
oat
as
yet
,
but
he
would
soon
:
and
quit
the
army
now
that
peace
be
proclaim
;
the
corsican
monster
lock
up
at
elba
;
promotion
by
consequence
over
;
and
no
chance
leave
for
the
display
of
his
undoubted
military
talent
and
valour
:
and
his
allowance
,
with
Amelia
's
settlement
,
would
enable
them
to
take
a
snug
place
in
the
country
somewhere
,
in
a
good
sporting
neighbourhood
;
and
he
would
hunt
a
little
,
and
farm
a
little
;
and
they
would
be
very
happy
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
remain
in
the
army
as
a
married
man
,
that
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Fancy
Mrs.
George
Osborne
in
lodging
in
a
county
town
;
or
,
bad
still
,
in
the
East
or
West
Indies
,
with
a
society
of
officer
,
and
patronize
by
Mrs.
Major
O'Dowd
!
<EOS>
Amelia
die
with
laugh
at
Osborne
's
story
about
Mrs.
Major
O'Dowd
.
 
<EOS>
He
love
her
much
too
fondly
to
subject
her
to
that
horrid
woman
and
her
vulgarity
,
and
the
rough
treatment
of
a
soldier
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
care
for
himself
 
not
he
;
but
his
dear
little
girl
should
take
the
place
in
society
to
which
,
as
his
wife
,
she
be
entitle
:
and
to
these
proposal
you
may
be
sure
she
accede
,
as
she
would
to
any
other
from
the
same
author
.
  
<EOS>
hold
this
kind
of
conversation
,
and
build
numberless
castle
in
the
air
(
which
Amelia
adorn
with
all
sort
of
flower
-
garden
,
rustic
walk
,
country
church
,
Sunday
school
,
and
the
like
;
while
George
have
his
mind
's
eye
direct
to
the
stable
,
the
kennel
,
and
the
cellar
)
,
this
young
pair
pass
away
a
couple
of
hour
very
pleasantly
;
and
as
the
Lieutenant
have
only
that
single
day
in
town
,
and
a
great
deal
of
most
important
business
to
transact
,
it
be
propose
that
Miss
Emmy
should
dine
with
her
future
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
this
invitation
be
accept
joyfully
.
 
<EOS>
He
conduct
her
to
his
sister
;
where
he
leave
her
talk
and
prattle
in
a
way
that
astonish
those
lady
,
who
think
that
George
may
make
something
of
her
;
and
he
then
go
off
to
transact
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
go
out
and
eat
ice
at
a
pastry
-
cook
's
shop
in
Charing
Cross
;
try
a
new
coat
in
Pall
Mall
;
drop
in
at
the
Old
Slaughters
'
,
and
call
for
Captain
Cannon
;
play
eleven
game
at
billiard
with
the
Captain
,
of
which
he
win
eight
,
and
return
to
Russell
Square
half
an
hour
late
for
dinner
,
but
in
very
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
with
old
Mr.
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
when
that
gentleman
come
from
the
City
,
and
be
welcome
in
the
drawing
-
room
by
his
daughter
and
the
elegant
Miss
Wirt
,
they
see
at
once
by
his
face
 
which
be
puffy
,
solemn
,
and
yellow
at
the
good
of
time
 
and
by
the
scowl
and
twitching
of
his
black
eyebrow
,
that
the
heart
within
his
large
white
waistcoat
be
disturb
and
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
when
Amelia
step
forward
to
salute
him
,
which
she
always
do
with
great
trembling
and
timidity
,
he
give
a
surly
grunt
of
recognition
,
and
drop
the
little
hand
out
of
his
great
hirsute
paw
without
any
attempt
to
hold
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
round
gloomily
at
his
eld
daughter
;
who
,
comprehend
the
meaning
of
his
look
,
which
ask
unmistakably
,
"
why
the
devil

here
?
<EOS>
"
say
at
once
:
  
"

<EOS>
His
good
humour
contrast
with
his

rattle
on
unceasingly
during
dinner
,
to
the
delight
of
all
 
of
one
especially

who
need
not

<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
young

have
discuss
the
orange
and
the
glass
of
wine
which
form
the
ordinary
conclusion
of
the
dismal
banquet
at

<EOS>
Amelia

George
would

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
He
be
deaf
to
the
waltz
;
they
grow
fainter
and
fainter
;
the
discomfited
performer
leave
the
huge
instrument
presently
;
and
though
her
three
friend
perform
some
of
the
loud
and
most
brilliant
new
piece
of
their
repertoire
,
she
do
not
hear
a

but
sate
thinking
,
and
bode
evil
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Osborne
's
scowl

terrific
always
,
have
never

so
deadly
to
her

<EOS>
His
eye
follow
her
out
of
the
room
,
as
if
she
have
be
guilty
of
something
.
<EOS>
when
they
bring
her
coffee
,
she
start
as
though
it
be
a
cup
of
poison
which
Mr.
Hicks
,
the
butler
,

forward
eagerly
to
meet
her

give
a
glance
of
great
scorn
at
the

and
beckon
the
young
Guardsman
out
of
the
back
drawing

room
,
lead
him
downstairs
into
that
now
desolate
dining

<EOS>
here

<EOS>
no

of
which
period

rung
briskly

and
answer
on
that
instant
by
Mr.

Miss

large
confidential
butler
(
who
,
indeed
,
happen
to
be
at
the
keyhole

before
whom
that
delicious
condiment
be
place
,
start
,
make
a
great
clattering
with
the
ladle
,
and
once
more
fall
back
in
the
most
gush
hysterical

<EOS>
"

what
long
night
she
lie
moan
,
and
in
almost
delirious
agony
respect
that
future
world
which
she
quite
ignore
when
she
be
in
good
health
.
 
<EOS>
picture
to
yourself
,
<EOS>
oh
fair
young
reader
,
a
worldly
,
selfish
,
graceless
,
thankless
,
religionless
old
woman
,
writhe
in
pain
and
fear
,
and
without
her
wig
.
 
<EOS>
picture
her
to
yourself
,
and
ere
you
be
old
,
learn
to
love
and
pray
!
  
<EOS>
Sharp
watch
this
graceless
bedside
with
indomitable
patience
.
<EOS>
nothing
escape
her
;
and
,
like
a
prudent
steward
,
she
find
a
use
for
everything
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
many
a
good
story
about
Miss
Crawley
's
illness
in
after
day
 
story
which
make
the
lady
blush
through
her
artificial
carnation
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
illness
she
be
never
out
of
temper
;
always
alert
;
she
sleep
light
,
have
a
perfectly
clear
conscience
;
and
could
take
that
refreshment
at
almost
any
minute
's
warning
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
you
see
very
few
trace
of
fatigue
in
her
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
may
be
a
trifle
paler
,
and
the
circle
round
her
eye
a
little
blacker
than
usual
;
but
whenever
she
come
out
from
the
sick
-
room
she
be
always
smile
,
fresh
,
and
neat
,
and
look
as
trim
in
her
little
dressing
-
gown
and
cap
,
as
in
her
smart
evening
suit
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
think
so
,
and
rave
about
her
in
uncouth
convulsion
.
<EOS>
the
barbed
shaft
of
love
have
penetrate
his
dull
hide
.
 
<EOS>
six
week
 
appropinquity
 
<EOS>
opportunity
 
have
victimise
him
completely
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
confidante
of
his
aunt
at
the
Rectory
,
of
all
person
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
She
rally
him
about
it
;
she
have
perceive
his
folly
;
she
warn
him
;
she
finish
by
own
that
little
Sharp
be
the
most
clever
,
droll
,
odd
,
good
-
natured
,
simple
,
kindly
creature
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
Rawdon
must
not
trifle
with
her
affection
,
though
 
dear
Miss
Crawley
would
never
pardon
him
for
that
;
for
she
,
too
,
be
quite
overcome
by
the
little
governess
,
and
love
Sharp
like
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Rawdon
must
go
away
 
<EOS>
go
back
to
his
regiment
and
naughty
London
,
and
not
play
with
a
poor
artless
girl
's
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
many
and
many
a
time
this
good
-
natured
lady
,
compassionate
the
forlorn
life
-
guardsman
's
condition
,
give
him
an
opportunity
of
see
Miss
Sharp
at
the
Rectory
,
and
of
walk
home
with
her
,
as
we
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
when
man
of
a
certain
sort
,
lady

be
in
love
,
though
they
see
the
hook
and
the
string

and
the
whole
apparatus
with
which
they
be
to
be
take
,
they
gorge
the
bait
nevertheless
 
<EOS>
they
must
come
to
it
 
<EOS>
they
must
swallow
it
 
and
be
presently
strike
and
land
gasping
.
 
<EOS>
Rawdon
see
there
be
a
manifest
intention
on
Mrs.
Bute
's
part
to
captivate
him
with
Rebecca
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
very
wise
;
but
he
be
a
man
about
town
,
and
have
see
several
season
.
 
<EOS>
a
light
dawn
upon
his
dusky
soul
,
as
he
think
,
through
a
speech
of
Mrs.
Bute
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
mark
my
word
,
Rawdon

"
she
say

<EOS>
"
You

have
Miss

inquire
the

More

Mrs.

,
with
a
flash
from
her
black

<EOS>
"
not

<EOS>
He
sha'n"t
have
her

the

You

You
silly

if
anything

Miss
Sharp
will
be
your

and
that
be
what
will
happen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rawdon
Crawley
,
Esquire
,
give
vent
to
a
prodigious
whistle
,
in
token
of
astonishment
at
this
announcement
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
deny
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
's
evident
liking
for
Miss
Sharp
have
not
escape
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
the
old
gentleman
's
character
well
;
and
a
more
unscrupulous
old
 
whyou
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
conclude
the
sentence
,
but
walk
home
,
curl
his
mustachio

and
convince
he
have
find
a
clue
to
Mrs.
Bute
's
mystery

<EOS>
"
by
Jove
,
it
be
too
bad
,
"
think
Rawdon
,
"
too
bad
,
by
Jove

<EOS>
I
do
believe
the
woman
want
the
poor
girl
to
be
ruin
,
in
order
that
she
should
not
come
into
the
family
as
Lady
Crawley

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
he
see
Rebecca
alone
,
he
rally
her
about
his
father
's
attachment
in
his
graceful
way

<EOS>
She
fling
up
her
head
scornfully

look
him
full
in
the
face

and
say
,

You

You

<EOS>
when
Miss

be
agitate
,
and
allude
to
her
maternal
relative

she
speak
with
ever
so
slight
a
foreign
accent

Stop

"
  
<EOS>
She
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
She
drive
out
with
Miss
Crawley
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
before
the
latter
's
illness
.
 
<EOS>
at
dinner
she
be
unusually
brilliant
and
lively
;
but
she
would
take
no
notice
of
the
hint
,
or
the
nod
,
or
the
clumsy
expostulation
of
the
humiliate
,
infatuate
guardsman
.
<EOS>
skirmish
of
this
sort
pass
perpetually
during
the
little
campaign
 
tedious
to
relate
,
and
similar
in
result
.
 
<EOS>
the
Crawley
heavy
cavalry
be
madden
by
defeat
,
and
route
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
Baronet
of
Queen
's
Crawley
have
not
have
the
fear
of
lose
his
sister
's
legacy
before
his
eye
,
he
never
would
have
permit
his
dear
girl
to
lose
the
educational
blessing
which
their
invaluable
governess
be
confer
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
house
at
home
seem
a
desert
without
her
,
so
useful
and
pleasant
<EOS>
have
Rebecca
make
herself
there
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
's
letter
be
not
copy
and
correct
;
his
book
not
make
up
;
his
household
business
and
manifold
scheme
neglect
,
now
that
his
little
secretary
be
away
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
easy
to
see
how
necessary
such
an
amanuensis
be
to
him
,
by
the
tenor
and
spelling
of
the
numerous
letter
which
he
send
to
her
,
entreat
her
and
command
her
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
almost
every
day
bring
a
frank
from
the
Baronet
,
enclose
the
most
urgent
prayer
to
Becky
for
her
return
,
or
convey
pathetic
statement
to
Miss
Crawley
,
regard
the
neglect
state
of
his
daughter
'
education
;
of
which
document
Miss
Crawley
take
very
little
heed
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Briggs
be
not
formally
dismiss
,
but
her
place
as
companion
be
a
sinecure
and
a
derision
;
and
her
company
be
the
fat
spaniel
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
or
occasionally
the
discontent
Firkin
in
the
housekeeper
's
closet
.
 
<EOS>
nor
though
the
old
lady
would
by
no
means
hear
of
Rebecca
's
departure
,
be
the
latter
regularly
instal
in
office
in
Park
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
like
many
wealthy
people
,
it
be
Miss
Crawley
's
habit
to
accept
as
much
service
as
she
could
get
from
her
inferior
;
and
good
-
naturedly
to
take
leave
of
them
when
she
no
longer
find
them
useful
.
 
<EOS>
Gratitude
among
certain
rich
folk
be
scarcely
natural
or
to
be
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
needy
people
's
service
as
their
due
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
you
,
<EOS>
o
poor
parasite
and
humble
hanger
-
on
,
much
reason
to
complain
!
 
<EOS>
Your
friendship
for
Dives
be
about
as
sincere
as
the
return
which
it
usually
get
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
money
you
love
,
and
not
the
man
;
and
be
Croesus
and
his
footman
to
change
place
you
know
,
you
poor
rogue
,
who
would
have
the
benefit
of
your
allegiance
.
  
<EOS>
and
I
be
not
sure
that
,
in
spite
of
Rebecca
's
simplicity
and
activity
,
and
gentleness
and
untire
good
humour
,
the
shrewd
old
London
lady
,
upon
whom
these
treasure
of
friendship
be
lavish
,
have
not
a
lurk
suspicion
all
the
while
of
her
affectionate
nurse
and
friend
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
often
cross
Miss
Crawley
's
mind
that
nobody
do
anything
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
measure
her
own
feeling
towards
the
world
,
she
must
have
be
pretty
well
able
to
gauge
those
of
the
world
towards
herself
;
and
perhaps
she
reflect
that
it
be
the
ordinary
lot
of
people
to
have
no
friend
if
they
themselves
care
for
nobody
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
meanwhile
Becky
be
the
great
comfort
and
convenience
to
her
,
and
she
give
her
a
couple
of
new
gown
,
and
an
old
necklace
and
shawl
,
and
show
her
friendship
by
abuse
all
her
intimate
acquaintance
to
her
new
confidante
(
than
which
there
can
not
be
a
more
touching
proof
of
regard
)
,
and
meditate
vaguely
some
great
future
benefit
 
to
marry
her
perhaps
to
Clump
,
the
apothecary
,
or
to
settle
her
in
some
advantageous
way
of
life
;
or
at
any
rate
,
to
send
her
back
to
Queen
's
Crawley
when
she
have
do
with
her
,
and
the
full
London
season
have
begin
.
  
<EOS>
when
Miss
Crawley
be
convalescent
and
descend
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
Becky
sing
to
her
,
and
otherwise
amuse
her
;
<EOS>
when
she
be
well
enough
to
drive
out
,
Becky
accompany
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
amongst
the
drive
which
they
take
,
whither
,
of
all
place
in
the
world
,
do
Miss
Crawley
's
admirable
good
-
nature
and
friendship
actually
induce
her
to
penetrate
,
but
to
Russell
Square
,
Bloomsbury
,
and
the
house
of
John
Sedley
,
Esquire
.
  
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
that
event
,
many
note
have
pass
,
as
may
be
imagine
,
between
the
two
dear
friend
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
month
of
Rebecca
's
stay
in
Hampshire
,
the
eternal
friendship
have
(
must
it
be
own
?
)
<EOS>
suffer
considerable
diminution
,
and
grow
so
decrepit
and
feeble
with
old
age
as
to
threaten
demise
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
both
girl
have
their
own
real
affair
to
think
of
:
<EOS>
rebecca
her
advance
with
her
employer
 
<EOS>
Amelia
her
own
absorb
topic
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
two
girl
meet
,
and
fly
into
each
other
's
arm
with
that
impetuosity
which
distinguish
the
behaviour
of
young
lady
towards
each
other
,
Rebecca
perform
her
part
of
the
embrace
with
the
most
perfect
briskness
and
energy
.
 
<EOS>
poor
little
Amelia
blush
as
she
kiss
her
friend
,
and
think
she
have
be
guilty
of
something
very
like
coldness
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
Their
first
interview
be
but
a
very
short
one
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
be
just
ready
to
go
out
for
a
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
be
wait
in
her
carriage
below
,
her
people
wonder
at
the
locality
in
which
they
find
themselves
,
and
gaze
upon
honest
Sambo
,
the
black
footman
of
Bloomsbury
,
as
one
of
the
queer
native
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
Amelia
come
down
with
her
kind
smile
look
(
Rebecca
must
introduce
her
to
her
friend
,
Miss
Crawley
be
long
to
see
her
,
and
be
too
ill
to
leave
her
carriage
)
 
<EOS>
when
,
I
say
,
Amelia
come
down
,
the
Park
Lane
shoulder
-
knot
aristocracy
wonder
more
and
more
that
such
a
thing
could
come
out
of
bloomsbury
;
and
Miss
Crawley
be
fairly
captivate
by
the
sweet
blushing
face
of
the
young
lady
who
come
forward
so
timidly
and
so
gracefully
to
pay
her
respect
to
the
protector
of
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
complexion
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
what
a
sweet
voice
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
say
,
as
they
drive
away
westward
after
the
little
interview
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Sharp
,
your
young
friend
be
charming
.
 
<EOS>
send
for
her
to
Park
Lane
,
do
you
hear
?
"
<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
have
a
good
taste
.
 
<EOS>
She
like
natural
manner
 
<EOS>
a
little
timidity
only
set
them
off
.
 
<EOS>
She
like
pretty
face
near
her
;
as
she
like
pretty
picture
and
nice
china
.
 
<EOS>
She
talk
of
Amelia
with
rapture
half
a
dozen
time
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
mention
her
to
Rawdon
Crawley
,
who
come
dutifully
to
partake
of
his
aunt
's
chicken
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
on
this
Rebecca
instantly
state
that
Amelia
be
engage
to
be
marry

Miss

and
a
few
day
after
this
conversation
,
Lieutenant
Osborne
receive
a
letter
,
in
Captain
Rawdon

schoolboy
hand
,
and
enclose
a
note
of
invitation
from
Miss
Crawley

<EOS>
Rebecca
despatch
also
an
invitation
to
her
darling
Amelia
,
who
,
you
may
be
sure
,
be
ready
enough
to
accept
it
when
she
hear
that
George
be
to
be
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
arrange
that
Amelia
be
to
spend
the
morning
with
the
lady
of
Park
Lane
,
where
all
be
very
kind
to
her
.
<EOS>
Rebecca
patronise
her
with
calm
superiority
:
she
be
so
much
the
cleverer
of
the
two
,
and
her
friend
so
gentle
and
unassuming
,
that
she
always
yield
when
anybody
choose
to
command
,
and
so
take
Rebecca
's
order
with
perfect
meekness
and
good
humour

<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
's
graciousness
be
also
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
She
continue
her
rapture
about
little
Amelia
,
talk
about
her
before
her
face
as
if
she
be
a
doll
,
or
a
servant
,
or
a
picture
,
and
admire
her
with
the
most
benevolent
wonder
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
admire
that
admiration
which
the
genteel
world
sometimes
extend
to
the
commonalty
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
agreeable
object
in
life
than
to
see
Mayfair
folk
condescend
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
's
prodigious
benevolence
rather
fatigue
poor
little
Amelia
,
and
I
be
not
sure
that
of
the
three
lady
in
Park
Lane
she
do
not
find
honest
Miss
Briggs
the
most
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
She
sympathise
with
Briggs
as
with
all
neglect
or
gentle
people

she
be
not
what
you
call
a
woman
of
spirit

profess
the
great
indifference
at
that
slight

nevertheless
look
at
Sir
Pitt
Crawley

everything
which

his
revenge
:
be
interested
about
Osborne

and
would
have
propose
piquet
to
him
that
very
evening
,
but
Miss
Crawley
absolutely
forbid
any
gambling
in
her
house
;
so
that
the
young
Lieutenant

purse
be
not
lighten
by
his
gallant
patron

for
that
day
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
make
an
engagement
for
the
next

somewhere

to
look
at
a
horse
that
Crawley
have
to
sell

and
to
try
him
in

and
to
dine
together

him
when
he
go
up
to
resume
his
acquaintance

Her

when

Miss

put
out
her
right
forefinger
,

a
little
nod

so
cool

Rawdon

could
hardly
restrain

five

Miss

solemnly
give
by

who
leave
her
little
protege

admire
her
as
a
dear
,
artless
,
tender
-
hearted

affectionate

incomprehensible
creature

now
she
be
leave
alone
to
think
over
the
sudden

wonderful
event
of
the
day

of
what
have
be

what
may
have
be
.

what
think
you
be
the
private
feeling
of
Miss

no
(
beg
her
pardon
)
of
Mrs.
Rebecca
?
 
<EOS>
if
,
a
few
page
back
,
the
present
writer
claim
the
privilege
of
peep
into
Miss
Amelia
Sedley
's
bedroom
,
and
understanding
with
the
omniscience
of
the
novelist
all
the
gentle
pain
and
passion
which
be
toss
upon
that
innocent
pillow
,
why
should
he
not
declare
himself
to
be
Rebecca

confidante
too
,
master
of
her
secret
,
and
seal
-
keeper
of
that
young
woman
's
conscience
?
  
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
in
the
first
place
,
Rebecca
give
way
to
some
very
sincere
and
touching
regret
that
a
piece
of
marvellous
good
fortune
should
have
be
so
near
her
,
and
she
actually
oblige
to
decline
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
natural
emotion
every
properly
regulate
mind
will
certainly
share
.
<EOS>
what
good
mother
be
there
that
would
not
commiserate
a
penniless
spinster
,
who
may
have
be
my
lady
,
and
have
share
four
thousand
a
year
?
 
<EOS>
what
well
-
breed
young
person
be
there
in
all
Vanity
Fair
,
who
will
not
feel
for
a
hard
-
work
,
ingenious
,
meritorious
girl
,
who
get
such
an
honourable
,
advantageous
,
provoking
offer
,
just
at
the
very
moment
when
it
be
out
of
her
power
to
accept
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
our
friend
Becky
's
disappointment
deserve
and
will
command
every
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
one
night
be
in
the
Fair
myself
,
at
an
evening
party
.
<EOS>
I
observe
old
Miss
Toady
there
also
present
,
single
out
for
her
special
attention
and
flattery
little
Mrs.
Briefless
,
the
barrister
's
wife
,
who
be
of
a
good
family
certainly
,
but
,
as
we
all
know
,
be
as
poor
as
poor
can
be
.
  
<EOS>
what
,
I
ask
in
my
own
mind
,
can
cause
this
obsequiousness
on
the
part
of
Miss
Toady
;
have
Briefless
get
a
county
court
,
or
have
his
wife
have
a
fortune
leave
her
?
<EOS>
Miss
Toady
explain
presently
,
with
that
simplicity
which
distinguish
all
her
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
she
say
,
"
Mrs
Briefless
be
granddaughter
of
Sir
John
Redhand
,
who
be
so
ill
at
Cheltenham
that
he
can
not
last
six
month
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Briefless
's
papa
succeed
;
so
you
see
she
will
be
a
baronet
's
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
and
Toady
ask
Briefless
and
his
wife
to
dinner
the
very
next
week
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
mere
chance
of
become
a
baronet
's
daughter
can
procure
a
lady
such
homage
in
the
world
,
surely
,
surely
we
may
respect
the
agony
of
a
young
woman
who
have
lose
the
opportunity
of
become
a
baronet
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
who
would
have
dream
of
Lady
Crawley
die
so
soon
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
sickly
woman
that
may
have
last
these
ten
year
 
Rebecca
think
to
herself
,
in
all
the
woe
of
repentance
 
<EOS>
and
I
may
have
be
my
lady
!
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
lead
that
old
man
whither
<EOS>
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
thank
Mrs.
Bute
for
her
patronage
,
and
Mr.
Pitt
for
his
insufferable
condescension
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
have
the
town
-
house
newly
furnish
and
decorate
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
have
the
handsome
carriage
in
London
,
and
a
box
at
the
opera
;
and
I
would
have
be
present
next
season
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
may
have
be
;
and
now
 
now
all
be
doubt
and
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
but
Rebecca
be
a
young
lady
of
too
much
resolution
and
energy
of
character
to
permit
herself
much
useless
and
unseemly
sorrow
for
the
irrevocable
past
;
so
,
have
devote
only
the
proper
portion
of
regret
to
it
,
she
wisely
turn
her
whole
attention
towards
the
future
,
which
be
now
vastly
more
important
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
survey
her
position
,
and
its
hope
,
doubt
,
and
chance
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
she
be
MARRIED
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
great
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
so
much
surprised
into
the
avowal
,
as
induce
to
make
it
by
a
sudden
calculation
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
come
some
day
:
and
why
not
now
as
at
a
later
period
?
<EOS>
He
who
would
have
marry
her
himself
must
at
least
be
silent
with
regard
to
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
how
Miss
Crawley
would
bear
the
news
 
<EOS>
be
the
great
question
.
<EOS>
Misgivings
Rebecca
have
;
but
she
remember
all
Miss
Crawley
have
say
;
the
old
lady
's
avow
contempt
for
birth
;
her
daring
liberal
opinion
;
her
general
romantic
propensity
;
her
almost
dote
attachment
to
her
nephew
,
and
her
repeatedly
express
fondness
for
Rebecca
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
fond
of
him
<EOS>
,
Rebecca
think
,
that
she
will
forgive
him
anything
:
she
be
so
used
to
me
that
I
do
not
think
she
could
be
comfortable
without
me
:
when
the
eclaircissement
come
there
will
be
a
scene
,
and
hysteric
,
and
a
great
quarrel
,
and
then
a
great
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
what
use
be
there
in
delay
?
<EOS>
the
die
be
throw
,
and
now
or
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
the
issue
must
be
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
resolve
that
Miss
Crawley
should
have
the
news
,
the
young
person
debate
in
her
mind
as
to
the
good
mean
of
convey
it
to
her
;
and
whether
she
should
face
the
storm
that
must
come
,
or
fly
and
avoid
it
until
its
first
fury
be
blow
over
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
meditation
she
write
the
following
letter
:
  
Dearest
friend
,
  
<EOS>
the
great
crisis
which
we
have
debate
about
so
often
be
COME
.
 
<EOS>
half
of
my
secret
be
know
,
and
I
have
think
and
think
,
until
I
be
quite
sure
that
now
be
the
time
to
reveal
the
WHOLE
of
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
come
to
me
this
morning
,
and
make
 
what
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
a
declaration
in
FORM
.
 
<EOS>
think
of
that
!
 
<EOS>
poor
little
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
Lady
Crawley
.
<EOS>
how
pleased
Mrs.
Bute
would
have
be
:
and
<EOS>
ma
tante
if
I
have
take
precedence
of
her
!
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
somebody
's
mamma
,
instead
of
 
<EOS>
o
,
I
tremble
,
<EOS>
I
tremble
,
when
I
think
how
soon
we
must
tell
all
!
  
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
know
I
be
married
,
and
not
know
to
whom
,
be
not
very
much
displeased
as
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Ma
tante
be
actually
ANGRY
that
I
should
have
refuse
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
all
kindness
and
graciousness
.
 
<EOS>
She
condescend
to
say
I
would
have
make
him
a
good
wife
;
and
vow
that
she
will
be
a
mother
to
your
little
Rebecca
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
be
shake
when
she
first
hear
the
news
.
 
<EOS>
but
need
we
fear
anything
beyond
a
momentary
anger
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
:
I
am
sure
not
.
 
<EOS>
She
dote
upon
you
so
<EOS>
(
you
naughty
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
man
)
,
that
she
would
pardon
you
anything
:
and
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
the
next
place
in
her
heart
be
mine
:
and
that
she
would
be
miserable
without
me
.
<EOS>
dearest
!
<EOS>
something
tells
me
we
shall
conquer
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
leave
that
odious
regiment
:
<EOS>
quit
gaming
,
racing
,
and
be
a
good
boy
;
and
we
shall
all
live
in
Park
Lane
,
and
ma
tante
shall
leave
us
all
her
money
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
try
and
walk
to
-
morrow
at
3
in
the
usual
place
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
B.
accompany
me
,
you
must
come
to
dinner
,
and
bring
an
answer
,
and
put
it
in
the
third
volume
of
Porteus
's
Sermons
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
at
all
event
,
come
to
your
own
  
R.
  
<EOS>
to
Miss
Eliza
Styles
,
at
Mr.
Barnet
's
,
Saddler
,
Knightsbridge
.
  
<EOS>
and
I
trust
there
be
no
reader
of
this
little
story
who
have
not
discernment
enough
to
perceive
that
the
Miss
Eliza
Styles
(
an
old
schoolfellow
,
Rebecca
say
,
with
whom
she
have
resume
an
active
correspondence
of
late
,
and
who
use
to
fetch
these
letter
from
the
saddler
's
)
,
wear
brass
spur
,
and
large
curl
mustachio
,
and
be
indeed
no
other
than
Captain
Rawdon
Crawley
.
   
<EOS>
the
letter
on
the
Pincushion
 
<EOS>
how
they
be
married
be
not
of
the
slight
consequence
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
what
be
to
hinder
a
captain
who
be
a
major
,
and
a
young
lady
who
be
of
age
,
from
purchase
a
licence
,
and
unite
themselves
at
any
church
in
this
town
?
 
<EOS>
who
need
to
be
tell
,
that
if
a
woman
have
a
will
she
will
assuredly
find
a
way
?
 
<EOS>
My
belief
be
that
one
day
,
when
Miss
Sharp
have
go
to
pass
the
forenoon
with
her
dear
friend
Miss
Amelia
Sedley
in
Russell
Square
,
a
lady
very
like
her
may
have
be
see
enter
a
church
in
the
City
,
in
company
with
a
gentleman
with
dyed
mustachio
,
who
,
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
interval
,
escort
her
back
to
the
hackney
-
coach
in
waiting
,
and
that
this
be
a
quiet
bridal
party
.
  
<EOS>
and
who
on
earth
,
after
the
daily
experience
we
have
,
can
question
the
probability
of
a
gentleman
marry
anybody
?
<EOS>
how
many
of
the
wise
and
learn
have
marry
their
cook
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
Lord
Eldon
himself
,
the
most
prudent
of
man
,
make
a
runaway
match
?
<EOS>
be
not
Achilles
and
Ajax
both
in
love
with
their
servant
maid
?
<EOS>
and
be
we
to
expect
a
heavy
dragoon
with
strong
desire
and
small
brain
,
who
have
never
control
a
passion
in
his
life
,
to
become
prudent
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
to
refuse
to
pay
any
price
for
an
indulgence
to
which
he
have
a
mind
?
 
<EOS>
if
people
only
make
prudent
marriage
,
what
a
stop
to
population
there
would
be
!
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
,
for
my
part
,
that
Mr.
Rawdon
's
marriage
be
one
of
the
honest
action
which
we
shall
have
to
record
in
any
portion
of
that
gentleman
's
biography
which
have
to
do
with
the
present
history
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
will
say
it
be
unmanly
to
be
captivate
by
a
woman
,
or
,
be
captivate
,
to
marry
her
;
and
the
admiration
,
the
delight
,
the
passion
,
the
wonder
,
the
unbounded
confidence
,
and
frantic
adoration
with
which
,
by
degree
,
this
big
warrior
get
to
regard
the
little
Rebecca
,
be
feeling
which
the
lady
at
least
will
pronounce
be
not
altogether
discreditable
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
sing
,
every
note
thrill
in
his
dull
soul
,
and
tingle
through
his
huge
frame
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
speak
,
he
bring
all
the
force
of
his
brain
to
listen
and
wonder
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
jocular
,
he
use
to
revolve
her
joke
in
his
mind
,
and
explode
over
them
half
an
hour
afterwards
in
the
street
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
groom
in
the
tilbury
by
his
side
,
or
the
comrade
ride
with
him
in
Rotten
Row
.
<EOS>
Her
word
be
oracle
to
him
,
her
small
action
mark
by
an
infallible
grace
and
wisdom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
she
sing
,
 
how
she
paint
,
"
think
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
she
ride
that
kicking
mare
at
Queen
's
Crawley
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
would
say
to
her
in
confidential
moment
,
"
by
Jove
,
Beck
,
you
be
fit
to
be
commander
-
in
-
chief
,
or
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
by
Jove
.
<EOS>
"
 
be
his
case
a
rare
one
?
and
do
not
we
see
every
day
in
the
world
many
an
honest
hercule
at
the
apron
-
string
of
Omphale
,
and
great
whiskered
Samsons
prostrate
in
Delilah
's
lap
?
  
<EOS>
when
,
then
,
Becky
tell
him
that
the
great
crisis
be
near
,
and
the
time
for
action
have
arrive
,
Rawdon
express
himself
as
ready
to
act
under
her
order
,
as
he
would
be
to
charge
with
his
troop
at
the
command
of
his
colonel
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
for
him
to
put
his
letter
into
the
third
volume
of
Porteus
.
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
easily
find
a
means
to
get
rid
of
Briggs
,
her
companion
,
and
meet
her
faithful
friend
in
"
the
usual
place
"
on
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
think
over
matter
at
night
,
and
communicate
to
Rawdon
the
result
of
her
determination
.
<EOS>
He
agree
,
of
course
,
to
everything
;
be
quite
sure
that
it
be
all
right
:
that
what
she
propose
be
good
;
that
Miss
Crawley
would
infallibly
relent
,
or
"
come
round
,
"
as
he
say
,
after
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
have
Rebecca
's
resolution
be
entirely
different
,
he
would
have
follow
them
as
implicitly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
head
enough
for
both
of
us
,
Beck
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
sure
to
get
us
out
of
the
scrape
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
your
equal
,
and
I
have
meet
with
some
clipper
in
my
time
too
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
this
simple
confession
of
faith
,
the
love
-
stricken
dragoon
leave
her
to
execute
his
part
of
the
project
which
she
have
form
for
the
pair
.
  
<EOS>
It
consist
simply
in
the
hiring
of
quiet
lodging
at
Brompton
,
or
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
barrack
,
for
Captain
and
Mrs.
Crawley
.
<EOS>
for
Rebecca
have
determine
,
and
very
prudently
,
we
think
,
to
fly
.
<EOS>
Rawdon
be
only
too
happy
at
her
resolve
;
he
have
be
entreat
her
to
take
this
measure
any
time
for
week
past
.
 
<EOS>
He
prance
off
to
engage
the
lodging
with
all
the
impetuosity
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
agree
to
pay
two
guinea
a
week
so
readily
,
that
the
landlady
regret
she
have
ask
him
so
little
.
<EOS>
He
order
in
a
piano
,
and
<EOS>
half
a
nursery
-
house
full
of
flower
:
and
a
heap
of
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
shawl
,
kid
glove
,
silk
stocking
,
gold
french
watch
,
bracelet
and
perfumery
,
he
send
them
in
with
the
profusion
of
blind
love
and
unbounded
credit
.
 
<EOS>
and
have
relieve
his
mind
by
this
outpouring
of
generosity
,
he
go
and
dine
nervously
at
the
club
,
wait
until
the
great
moment
of
his
life
should
come
.
  
<EOS>
the
occurrence
of
the
previous
day
;
the
admirable
conduct
of
Rebecca
in
refuse
an
offer
so
advantageous
to
her
,
the
secret
unhappiness
prey
upon
her
,
the
sweetness
and
silence
with
which
she
bear
her
affliction
,
make
Miss
Crawley
much
more
tender
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
an
event
of
this
nature
,
a
marriage
,
or
a
refusal
,
or
a
proposal
,
thrill
through
a
whole
household
of
woman
,
and
set
all
their
hysterical
sympathy
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
as
an
observer
of
human
nature
,
I
regularly
frequent
<EOS>
St.
George
's
,
Hanover
Square
,
during
the
genteel
marriage
season
;
and
though
I
have
never
see
the
bridegroom
's
male
friend
give
way
to
tear
,
or
the
beadle
and
officiate
clergy
any
way
affect
,
yet
<EOS>
it
be
not
at
all
uncommon
to
see
woman
who
be
not
in
the
least
concerned
in
the
operation
go
on
 
old
lady
who
be
long
past
marrying
,
stout
middle
-
aged
female
with
plenty
of
son
and
daughter
,
let
alone
pretty
young
creature
in
pink
bonnet
,
who
be
on
their
promotion
,
and
may
naturally
take
an
interest
in
the
ceremony
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
be
quite
common
to
see
the
woman
present
piping
,
sobbing
,
sniffle
;
hide
their
little
face
in
their
little
useless
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
;
and
heaving
,
old
and
young
,
with
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
friend
,
the
fashionable
John
Pimlico
,
marry
the
lovely
Lady
Belgravia
Green
Parker
,
the
excitement
be
so
general
that
even
the
little
snuffy
old
pew
-
opener
who
let
me
into
the
seat
be
in
tear
.
 
<EOS>
and
wherefore
?
<EOS>

Miss

indulge
in
the

an
object
of

most
tender
interest

more
sweetly

in
Park
Lane

<EOS>
She
twine
herself
round
the
heart
of
Miss
Crawley

<EOS>
She
speak
lightly
and
laughingly
of
Sir
Pitt
's
proposal
,
ridicule
it
as
the
foolish
fancy
of
an
old
man
;
and
her
eye
fill
with
tear
,
and
Briggs
's
heart
with
unutterable
pang
of
defeat
,
as
she
say
she
desire
no
other
lot
than
to
remain
for
ever
with
her
dear
benefactress

if
Rawdon

instead

the

down
on

before
the
old

avow
all

adventure

no

house
;
where
the
people

look
out

the
first

floor
window
,
must
infallibly
,
as
you
think
,
sit
with
their
foot
in
the

where
the

in
the
little
garden
in

bloom
with
a
perennial
display
of
little
child

pinafore
,
little
red
sock
,
cap
,
&
c.
(
polyandria
polygynia

;
whence
you
hear
the
sound
of
jingle
spinet
and
woman
singe
;
where
little
porter
pot
hang
on
the
railing
sun
themselves
;
whither
of
evening
you
see
City
clerk
pad
wearily
<EOS>
:
here
it
be
that
Mr.
Clapp
,
the
clerk
of
Mr.
Sedley
,
have
his
domicile
,
and
in
this
asylum
the
good
old
gentleman
hide
his
head
with
his
wife
and
daughter
when
the
crash
come
.
  
<EOS>
Jos
Sedley
have
act
as
a
man
of
his
disposition
would
,
when
the
announcement
of
the
family
misfortune
reach
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
come
to
London
,
but
he
write
to
his
mother
to
draw
upon
his
agent
for
whatever
money
be
want
,
so
that
his
kind
break
-
spirited
old
parent
have
no
present
poverty
to
fear
.
 
<EOS>
this
done
,
Jos
go
on
at
the
boarding
-
house
at
Cheltenham
pretty
much
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
drive
his
curricle
;
he
drink
his
claret
;
he
play
his
rubber
;
he
tell
his
indian
story
,
and
the
irish
widow
console
and
flatter
him
as
usual
.
<EOS>
His
present
of
money
,
needful
as
it
be
,
make
little
impression
on
his
parent
;
and
I
have
hear
Amelia
say
that
the
first
day
on
which
she
see
her
father
lift
up
his
head
after
the
failure
be
on
the
receipt
of
the
packet
of
fork
and
spoon
with
the
young
stockbroker
'
love
,
over
which
he
burst
out
cry
like
a
child
,
be
greatly
more
affected
than
even
his
wife
,
to
whom
the
present
be
address
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
Dale
,
the
junior
of
the
house
,
who
purchase
the
spoon
for
the
firm

be
,
in
fact
,
very
sweet
upon
Amelia
,
and
offer
for
her
in
spite
of
all
.
<EOS>
He
marry
Miss
Louisa
Cutts
(
daughter
of
Higham
and
Cutts
,
the
eminent
cornfactor
)
with
a
handsome
fortune
in
1820
;
and
be
now
live
in
splendour
,
and
with
a
numerous
family
,
at
his
elegant
villa
,
Muswell
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
must
not
let
the
recollection
of
this
good
fellow
cause
us
to
diverge
from
the
principal
history
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
the
reader
have
much
too
good
an
opinion
of
Captain
and
Mrs.
Crawley
to
suppose
that
they
ever
would
have
dream
of
pay
a
visit
to
so
remote
a
district
as
Bloomsbury
,
if
they
think
the
family
whom
they
propose
to
honour
with
a
visit
be
not
merely
out
of
fashion
,
but
out
of
money
,
and
could
be
serviceable
to
them
in
no
possible
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
be
entirely
surprised
at
the
sight
of
the
comfortable
old

where
she
have
meet
with
no
small
kindness
,
ransack
by
broker
and
bargainer
,
and
its
quiet
family
treasure
give
up
to
public
desecration
and
plunder

by

sort
of

it
be
not

that
Rawdon
Crawley
have
a
deliberate
desire
to

Mr.

only
wish
to

that

how

those

the
dulness

<EOS>
We

praise
a

<EOS>
a

by

They

smitten
by

her

circumspection

modesty
never
forsook
her
for

Crawley

reputation

Mrs.

<EOS>
when
the

I
wonder
whether
the
imperial
bird
have
any
eye
for
a
little
corner
of
the
parish
of
Bloomsbury
,
London
,
which
you
may
have
think
so
quiet

that
even

pass
unobserved
there
?
  
<EOS>
"

such

create

cause
Russia
to
drop
his

take
Prussia
into

,
and
Talleyrand

Metternich
to
wag
their
head
together
,
while
Prince
Hardenberg
,
and
even
the

Marquis

but
how
be
this
intelligence
to
affect

in

before

the
watchman

I

He

overpower
his

his

but
it

most
moved

sudden

<EOS>
when
he
sink
back

it

the

take
the

<EOS>
She
take
his

an
inexpressible

<EOS>
only
once
in
the
course
of
the
long
night
as
they
sate
together
,
and
poor
Sedley
open
his
pen
-
up
soul

and
tell
the
story
of
his
loss
and
embarrassment
 
the
treason
of
some
of
his
old
friend

the
manly
kindness
of
some

from
whom
he
never
could

it
 
in

only

"

the

She

<EOS>
in

she

<EOS>
to

can
any

tell
all

who
will
be
open
where
there

Our

solitary

<EOS>
She
have
no

ever

she

anything

<EOS>
She
could
not
tell
the

her
doubt

the

Her

assert

George

worthy

faithful

though
she

<EOS>
how
many
a

have
she
say

and
get
no
echo
from
him

<EOS>
how
many
suspicion

selfishness

indifference
have
she

obstinately
overcome

<EOS>
to

could
the
poor

tell
these
daily
struggle

torture

<EOS>
Her

only
half
understand
her

<EOS>
She
do
not
dare
to
own
that
the
man
she
love
be
her
inferior

or
to
feel
that
she
have
give
her
heart
away
too
soon

<EOS>
give
once
,
the
pure
bashful
maiden
be

modest

too
much

<EOS>
We

Turks

have
make

subscribe

our

<EOS>
We
let
their
body
go
abroad
liberally
enough
,
with
smile
and
ringlet
and
pink
bonnet
to
disguise
them
instead
of
veil
and
yakmak

<EOS>
but
their
soul
must
be
see
by
only
one
man

and
they
obey
not
unwillingly
,
and
consent
to
remain
at
home
as
our
slave
 
minister
to
us
and
do
drudgery
for
us

<EOS>
so
imprison

<EOS>
They

John

anon

the

they

and
grumble
against

<EOS>
of
all
Sedley

opponent
in
his
debate
with
his
creditor
which
now
ensue

and
harass
the
feeling
of
the
humiliate
old

so
severely
,
that
in
six
week
he
oldene
more
than
he
have
do
for
fifteen
year
before
 
the
most
determined
and
obstinate
seem

be
John
Osborne
,
his
old

neighbour
 
John
Osborne
,
whom
he
have
set
up
in
life
 
who
be
under
a
hundred
obligation
to
him
 
and
whose
son
be
to
marry
Sedley
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
any
one
of
these
circumstance
would
account
for
the
bitterness
of
Osborne
's
opposition
.
  
<EOS>
when
one
man
have
be
under
very
remarkable
obligation
to
another
,
with
whom
he
subsequently
quarrel
,
a
common
sense

decency

it
be

make
of
the

severer
enemy

a

stranger
would
be

<EOS>
to
account
for
your
own
hard
-
heartedness
and
ingratitude
in
such
a
case
,
you
be
bind
to
prove
the
other
party
's
crime
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
you
be
selfish
,
brutal
,
and
angry
at
the
failure
of
a
speculation
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
 
<EOS>
it
be
that
your
partner
have
lead
you
into
it
by
the
basest
treachery
and
with
the
most
sinister
motive
.
 
<EOS>
from
a
mere
sense
of
consistency
,
a
persecutor
be
bind
to
show
that
the
fall
man
be
a
villain
 
<EOS>
otherwise
he
,
the
persecutor
,
be
a
wretch
himself

<EOS>
and
as
a
general
rule
,
which
may
make
all
creditor
who
be
inclined
to
be
severe
pretty
comfortable
in
their
mind
,
no
man
embarrass
be
altogether
honest
,
very
likely
.
 
<EOS>
They
conceal
something
;
they
exaggerate
chance
of
good
luck
;
hide
away
the
real
state
of
affair
;
say
that
thing
be
flourish
when
they
be
hopeless
,
keep
a
smile
face
(
a
dreary
smile
it
be
)
upon
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
 
<EOS>
be
ready
to
lay
hold
of
any
pretext
for
delay
or
of
any
money
,
so
as
to
stave
off
the
inevitable
ruin
a
few
day
longer
.
"
<EOS>
down
with
such
dishonesty
,
"
say
the
creditor
in
triumph
,
and
revile
his
sink
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
fool
,
why
do
you
catch
at
a

"
<EOS>
calm
good

to
the

drown

<EOS>
"
You
villain

why
do
you
shrink

plunge

the
irretrievable

"
say
prosperity
to
the
poor
devil
battle
in
that
black
gulf
.
 
<EOS>
who
have
not
remark
the
readiness
with
which
the
close
of
friend
and
honestest
of
man
suspect
and
accuse
each
other
of
cheat
when
they
fall
out
on
money
matter
?
<EOS>
everybody
do
it
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
right
,
I
suppose
,
and
the
world
be
a
rogue
.
  
<EOS>
then
Osborne
have
the
intolerable
sense
of
former
benefit
to
goad
and
irritate
him
:
these
be
always
a
cause
of
hostility
aggravate
.
<EOS>
finally
,
he
have
to
break
off
the
match
between
Sedley
's
daughter
and
his
son
;
and
as
it
have
go
very
far
indeed
,
and
as
the
poor
girl
's
happiness
and
perhaps
character
be
compromise
,
it
be
necessary
to
show
the
strong
reason
for
the
rupture
,
and
for
John
Osborne
to
prove
John
Sedley
to
be
a
very
bad
character
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
meeting
of
creditor
,
then
,
he
comport
himself
with
a
savageness
and
scorn
towards
Sedley
,
which
almost
succeed
in
break
the
heart
of
that
ruin
bankrupt
man
.
 
<EOS>
on
George
's
intercourse
with
Amelia
he
put
an
instant
veto
 
menace
the
youth
with
malediction
if
he
break
his
command
,
and
vilipend
the
poor
innocent
girl
as
the
base
and
most
artful
of
vixen
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
great
condition
of
anger
and
hatred
be
,
that
you
must
tell
and
believe
lie
against
the
hate
object
,
in
order
,
as
we
say
,
to
be
consistent
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
great
crash
come
 
the
announcement
of
ruin
,
and
the
departure
from
Russell
Square
,
and
the
declaration
that
all
be
over
between
her
and
George
 
all
over
between
her
and
love
,
her
and
happiness
,
her
and
faith
in
the
world
 
a
brutal
letter
from
John
Osborne
tell
her
in
a
few
curt
line
that
her
father
's
conduct
have
be
of
such
a
nature
that
all
engagement
between
the
family
be
at
an
end
 
<EOS>
when
the
final
award
come
,
it
do
not
shock
her
so
much
as
her
parent
,
as
her
mother
rather
expect
(
for
John
Sedley
himself
be
entirely
prostrate
in
the
ruin
of
his
own
affair
and
shatter
honour
)
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
take
the
news
very
palely
and
calmly
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
confirmation
of
the
dark
presage
which
have
long
go
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
mere
reading
of
the
sentence
 
of
the
crime
she
have
long
ago
be
guilty
 
<EOS>
the
crime
of
love
wrongly
,
too
violently
,
against
reason
.
<EOS>
She
tell
no
more
of
her
thought
now
than
she
have
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
scarcely
more
unhappy
now
when
convince
all
hope
be
over
,
than
before
when
she
feel
but
dare
not
confess
that
it
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
change
from
the
large
house
to
the
small
one
without
any
mark
or
difference
;
remain
in
her
little
room
for
the
most
part
;
pine
silently
;
and
die
away
day
by
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
female
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Bullock
,
I
do
not
think
your
heart
would
break
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
strong
-
minded
young
woman
with
proper
principle
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
venture
to
say
that
mine
would
;
it
have
suffer
,
and
,
it
must
be
confess
,
survive
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
some
soul
thus
gently
constitute
,
thus
frail
,
and
delicate
,
and
tender
.
  
<EOS>
whenever
old
John
Sedley
think
of
the
affair
between
George
and
Amelia
,
or
allude
to
it
,
it
be
with
bitterness
almost
as
great
as
Mr.
Osborne
himself
have
show
.
 
<EOS>
He

her
good
and
beautiful

<EOS>
and
for
himself
,
he
blush
with
remorse
and
shame
,
as
the
remembrance
of
his
own
selfishness
and
indifference
contrast
with
that
perfect
purity
.
<EOS>
for
a
while
,
glory
,
war
,
everything
be

and
the
pair
of
friend
talk
about
her
only

<EOS>
"
where

they
?
"
<EOS>
Osborne
ask
,
after
a
long
talk
,
and
a
long
pause
 
and
,
in
truth
,
with
no
little
shame
at
think
that
he
have
take
no
step
to
follow
her

He
have
not
merely
send

but
have
write
a
note
to
Mrs.
Sedley
,
and
ask
permission
to
come
and
see
her
 
and
he
have
see
her

and
Amelia
too
,
yesterday
,
before

Chatham

,
what
be
more

he
have
bring
that
farewell
letter
and
packet
which
have
so
move
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
-
natured
fellow
have
find
Mrs.
Sedley
only
too
willing
to
receive
him
,
and
greatly
agitate
by
the
arrival
of
the
piano
,
which
,
as
she
conjecture
,
MUST
have
come
from
George
,
and
be
a
signal
of
amity
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
Captain
Dobbin
do
not
correct
this
error
of
the
worthy
lady
,
but
listen
to
all
her
story
of
complaint
and
misfortune
with
great
sympathy
 
condole
with
her
loss
and
privation
,
and
agree
in
reprehend
the
cruel
conduct
of
Mr.
Osborne
towards
his
first
benefactor
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
ease
her
overflow
bosom
somewhat
,
and
pour
forth
many
of
her
sorrow
,
he
have
the
courage
to
ask
actually
to
see
Amelia
,
who
be
above
in
her
room
as
usual
,
and
whom
her
mother
lead
tremble
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
Her
appearance
be
so
ghastly
,
and
her
look
of
despair
<EOS>
so
pathetic
,
that
honest
William
Dobbin
be
frightened
as
he
behold
it
;
and
read
the
most
fatal
foreboding
in
that
pale
fix
face

<EOS>
after
sit
in
his
company
a
minute
or
two
,
she
put
the
packet
into
his

,
and
say
,
"

the

<EOS>
the
good

He

<EOS>
inexpressible

he

there

Miss
Crawley
at
Nurse
 
<EOS>
We
have
see
how
Mrs.
Firkin
,
the
lady
's
maid
,
as
soon
as
any
event
of
importance
to
the
Crawley
family
come
to
her
knowledge
,
feel
bind
to
communicate
it
to
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
,
at
the
Rectory
;
and
have
before
mention
how
particularly
kind
and
attentive
that
good
-
natured
lady
be
to
Miss
Crawley
's
confidential
servant
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
a
gracious
friend
to
Miss
Briggs
,
the
companion
,
also
;
and
have
secure
the
latter
's
good
-
will
by
a
number
of
those
attention
and
promise
,
which
cost
so
little
in
the
making
,
and
be
yet
so
valuable
and
agreeable
to
the
recipient
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
every
good
economist
and
manager
of
a
household
must
know
how
cheap
and
yet
how
amiable
these
profession
be
,
and
what
a
flavour
they
give
to
the
most
homely
dish
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
the
blundering
idiot
who
say
that
"
fine
word
butter
no
parsnip
"
?
 
<EOS>
half
the
parsnip
of
society
be
serve
and
render
palatable
with
no
other
sauce
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
immortal
Alexis
Soyer
can
make
more
delicious
soup
for
a
half
-
penny
than
an
ignorant
cook
can
concoct
with
pound
of
vegetable
and
meat
,
so
a
skilful
artist
will
make
a
few
simple
and
pleasing
phrase
go
farther
than
ever
so
much
substantial
benefit
-
stock
in
the
hand
of
a
mere
bungler
.
<EOS>
nay
,
we
know
that
substantial
benefit
often
sicken
some
stomach
;
whereas
,
most
will
digest
any
amount
of
fine
word
,
and
be
always
eager
for
more
of
the
same
food
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
have
tell
Briggs
and
Firkin
so
often
of
the
depth
of
her
affection
for
them
;
and
what
she
would
do
,
if
she
have
Miss
Crawley
's
fortune
,
for
friend
so
excellent
and
attach
,
that
the
lady
in
question
have
the
deep
regard
for
her
;
and
feel
as
much
gratitude
and
confidence
as
if
Mrs.
Bute
have
load
them
with
the
most
expensive
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Rawdon
Crawley
,
on
the
other
hand
,
like
a
selfish
heavy
dragoon
as
he
be
,
never
take
the
least
trouble
to
conciliate
his
aunt
's
aide
-
de
-
camp
,
show
his
contempt
for
the
pair
with
entire
frankness
 
make
Firkin
pull
off
his
boot
on
one
occasion
 
send
her
out
in
the
rain
on
ignominious
message
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
give
her
a
guinea
,
fling
it
to
her
as
if
it
be
a
box
on
the
ear
.
 
<EOS>
as
his
aunt
,
too
,
make
a
butt
of
Briggs
,
the
Captain
follow
the
example
,
and
level
his
joke
at
her
 
joke
about
as
delicate
as
a
kick
from
his
charger
.
<EOS>
whereas
,
Mrs.
Bute
consult
her
in
matter
of
taste
or
difficulty
,
admire
her
poetry
,
and
by
a
thousand
act
of
kindness
and
politeness
,
show
her
appreciation
of
Briggs
;
and
if
she
make
Firkin
a
twopenny
-
halfpenny
present
,
accompany
it
with
so
many
compliment
,
that
the
twopence
-
half
-
penny
be
transmute
into
gold
in
the
heart
of
the
grateful
waiting
-
maid
,
who
,
besides
,
be
look
forwards
quite
contentedly
to
some
prodigious
benefit
which
must
happen
to
her
on
the
day
when
Mrs.
Bute
come
into
her
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
the
different
conduct
of
these
two
people
be
point
out
respectfully
to
the
attention
of
person
commence
the
world
.
<EOS>
praise
everybody
,
I
say
to
such
:
never
be
squeamish
,
but
speak
out
your
compliment
both
point
-
blank
in
a
man
's
face
,
and
behind
his
back
,
when
you
know
there
be
a
reasonable
chance
of
his
hearing
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
never
lose
a
chance
of
say
a
kind
word
.
 
<EOS>
as
Collingwood
never
see
a
vacant
place
in
his
estate
<EOS>
but
he
take
an
acorn
out
of
his
pocket
and
pop
it
in
;
so
deal
with
your
compliment
through
life
.
 
<EOS>
an
acorn
cost
nothing
;
but
it
may
sprout
into
a
prodigious
bit
of
timber
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
during
Rawdon
Crawley
's
prosperity
,
he
be
only
obey
with
sulky
acquiescence
;
when
his
disgrace
come
,
there
be
nobody
to
help
or
pity
him
.
 
<EOS>
Whereas
,
when
Mrs.
Bute
take
the
command
at
Miss
Crawley
's
house
,
the
garrison
there
be
charm
to
act
under
such
a
leader
,
expect
all
sort
of
promotion
from
her
promise
,
her
generosity
,
and
her
kind
word
.
  
<EOS>
that
he
would
consider
himself
beat
,
after
one
defeat
,
and
make
no
attempt
to
regain
the
position
he
have
lose
,
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
never
allow
herself
to
suppose
.
<EOS>
She
know
Rebecca
to
be
too
clever
and
spirited
and
desperate
a
woman
to
submit
without
a
struggle
;
and
feel
that
she
must
prepare
for
that
combat
,
and
be
incessantly
watchful
against
assault
;
or
mine
,
or
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
though
she
hold
the
town
,
be
she
sure
of
the
principal
inhabitant
?
 
<EOS>
Would
Miss
Crawley
herself
hold
out
;
and
have
she
not
a
secret
longing
to
welcome
back
the
oust
adversary
?
 
<EOS>
the
old
lady
like
Rawdon
,
and
Rebecca
,
who
amuse
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
could
not
disguise
from
herself
the
fact
that
none
of
her
party
could
so
contribute
to
the
pleasure
of
the
town
-
breed
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
girl
'
singing
,
after
that
little
odious
governess

,
I
know

unbearable

the
candid
rector

wife
own
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
always
use
to
go
to
sleep
when
Martha

Louisa
play
their
duet
.
<EOS>
Jim
's
stiff
college
manner
and
poor
dear
Bute
's
talk
about
his
dog
and
horse
always
annoy
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
take
her
to
the
Rectory
,
she
would
grow
angry
with
us
all
,
and
fly
,
I
know
she
would
;
and
may
fall
into
that
horrid
Rawdon
's
clutch
again
,
and
be
the
victim
of
that
little
viper
of
a
Sharp
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
it
be
clear
to
me
that
she
be
exceedingly
unwell
,
and
can
not
move
for
some
week
,
at
any
rate
;
during
which
we
must
think
of
some
plan
to
protect
her
from
the
art
of
those
unprincipled
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
very
good
of
moment
,
if
anybody
tell
Miss
Crawley
that
she
be
,
or
look
ill
,
the
tremble
old
lady
send
off
for
her
doctor
;
and
I
daresay
she
be
very
unwell
after
the
sudden
family
event
,
which
may
serve
to
shake
strong
nerve
than
her
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
Mrs.
Bute
think
it
be
her
duty
to
inform
the
physician
,
and
the
apothecary
,
and
the
dame
-
de
-
compagnie
,
and
the
domestic
,
that
Miss
Crawley
be
in
a
most
critical
state
,
and
that
they
be
to
act
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
the
street
lay
knee
-
deep
with
straw
;
and
the
knocker
put
by
with
Mr.
Bowls
's
plate
.
 
<EOS>
She
insist
that
the
Doctor
should
call
twice
a
day
;
and
deluge
her
patient
with
draught
every
two
hour
.
 
<EOS>
when
anybody
enter
the
room
,
she
utter
a
shshshsh
so
sibilant
and
ominous
,
that
it
frighten
the
poor
old
lady
in
her
bed
,
from
which
she
could
not
look
without
see
Mrs.
Bute
's
beady
eye
eagerly
fix
on
her
,
as
the
latter
sate
steadfast
in
the
arm
-
chair
by
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
lighten
in
the
dark
(
for
she
keep
the
curtain
close
)
as
she
move
about
the
room
on
velvet
<EOS>
paw
like
a
cat
.
 
<EOS>
there
Miss
Crawley
lie
for
day
 
ever
so
many
day
 
Mr.
Bute
read
book
of
devotion
to
her
:
for
night
,
long
night
,
during
which
she
have
to
hear
the
watchman
sing
,
the
night
-
light
sputter
;
visit
at
midnight
,
the
last
thing
,
by
the
stealthy
apothecary
;
and
then
leave
to
look
at
Mrs.
Bute
's
twinkle
eye
,
or
the
flick
of
yellow
that
the
rushlight
throw
on
the
dreary
darken
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
Hygeia
herself
would
have
fall
sick
under
such
a
regimen
;
and
how
much
more
this
poor
old
nervous
victim
?
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
when
she
be
in
health
and
good
spirit
,
this
venerable
inhabitant
of
Vanity
Fair
have
as
free
notion
about
religion
and
moral
as
Monsieur
de
Voltaire
himself
could
desire
,
but
when
illness
overtake
her
,
it
be
aggravate
by
the
most
dreadful
terror
of
death
,
and
an
utter
cowardice
take
possession
of
the
prostrate
old
sinner
.
  
<EOS>
sick
-
bed
homily
and
pious
reflection
be
,
to
be
sure
,
out
of
place
in
mere
story
-
book
,
and
we
be
not
go
(
after
the
fashion
of
some
novelist
of
the
present
day
)
to
cajole
the
public
into
a
sermon
,
when
it
be
only
a
comedy
that
the
reader
pay
his
money
to
witness
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
without
preach
,
the
truth
may
surely
be
bear
in
mind
,
that
the
bustle
,
and
triumph
,
and
laughter
,
and
gaiety
which
Vanity
Fair
exhibit
in
public
,
do
not
always
pursue
the
performer
into
private
life
,
and
that
the
most
dreary
depression
of
spirit
and
dismal
repentance
sometimes
overcome
him
.
 
<EOS>
recollection
of
the
best
ordain
banquet
will
scarcely
cheer
sick
epicure

<EOS>
reminiscence
of
the
most
become
dress
and
brilliant
ball
triumph
will
go
very
little
way
to
console
fade
beauty

<EOS>
perhaps
statesman
,
at
a
particular
period
of
existence
,
be
not
much
gratify
at

Mrs.

endeavour

instil
her

a
proper
abhorrence
for

Rawdon

his

bring
forward
such
a

would

serve

condemn

I

never

the
victim

immolate

<EOS>
nay

very

from

<EOS>
of

<EOS>
It
be
a
lost
woman
who
be
marry
to
a
lost
man
;
and
the
moral
to
be
infer
from
Mrs.
Bute
's
tale
be
,
that
the
knavery
of
the
pair
be
irremediable
,
and
that
no
properly
conduct
person
should
ever
notice
them
again
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
material
which
prudent
Mrs.
Bute
gather
together
in
Park
Lane
,
the
provision
and
ammunition
as
it
be
with
which
she
fortify
the
house
against
the
siege
which
she
know
that
Rawdon
and
his
wife
would
lay
to
Miss
Crawley
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
a
fault
may
be
find
with
her
arrangement
,
it
be
this
,
that
she
be
too
eager
:
<EOS>
she
manage
rather
too
well
;
undoubtedly
she
make
Miss
Crawley
more
ill
than
be
necessary
;
and
though
the
old
invalid
succumb
to
her
authority
,
it
be
so
harass
and
severe
,
that
the
victim
would
be
incline
to
escape
at
the
very
first
chance
which
fall
in
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
manage
woman
,
the
ornament
of
their

woman
who
order
everything
for
everybody

and
know
so
much
well
than
any
person
concerned
what
be
good
for

sometimes

upon
the
possibility
of
a
domestic
revolt

upon
other
extreme
consequence

thus
,
for
instance
,
Mrs.
Bute
,
with
the
good
intention
no

in

wear
herself
to
death
as

for
the
sake
of
her

the

Mr.

of

"
say
the

,
and
after
a
pause
add
,
"
She

out
:
or
I
would
not

hundred

<EOS>
"
and
it
be
act
upon
this
hint
that
the
worthy
apothecary
speak
with
so
much
candour
to
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
.
  
<EOS>
have
the
old
lady
under
her
hand
:
in
bed
:
with
nobody
near
,
Mrs.
Bute
have
make
more
than
one
assault
upon
her
,
to
induce
her
to
alter
her
will
.
 
<EOS>
but
Miss
Crawley
's
usual
terror
regard
death
increase
greatly
when
such
dismal
proposition
be
make
to
her
,
and
Mrs.
Bute
see
that
she
must
get
her
patient
into
cheerful
spirit
and
health
before
she
could
hope
to
attain
the
pious
object
which
she
have
in
view
.
<EOS>
whither
to
take
her
be
the
next
puzzle
.
<EOS>
the
only
place
where
she
be
not
likely
to
meet
those
odious
Rawdons
be
at
church
,
and
that
will
not
amuse
her
,
Mrs.
Bute
justly
feel
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
go
and
visit
our
beautiful
suburb
of
London
,
"
she
then
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
they
be
the
most
picturesque
in
the
world
"
;
and
so
she
have
a
sudden
interest
for
Hampstead
,
and
Hornsey
,
and
find
that
Dulwich
have
great
charm
for
her
,
and
get
her
victim
into
her
carriage
,
drive
her
to
those
rustic
spot
,
beguile
the
little
journey
with
conversation
about
Rawdon
and
his
wife
,
and
tell
every
story
to
the
old
lady
which
could
add
to
her
indignation
against
this
pair
of
reprobate
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
Mrs.
Bute
pull
the
string
unnecessarily
tight
.
<EOS>
for
though
she
work
up
Miss
Crawley
to
a
proper
dislike
of
her
disobedient
nephew
,
the
invalid
have
a
great
hatred
and
secret
terror
of
her
victimizer
,
and
pant
to
escape
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
brief
space
,
she
rebel
against
Highgate
and
Hornsey
utterly
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
go
into
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
know
they
would
meet
the
abominable
Rawdon
there
,
and
she
be
right
.
<EOS>
one
day
in
the
ring
,
Rawdon
's
stanhope
come
in
sight
;
Rebecca
be
seat
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
enemy
's
equipage
Miss
Crawley
occupy
her
usual
place
,
with
Mrs.
Bute
on
her
left
,
the
poodle
and
Miss
Briggs
on
the
back
seat
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
nervous
moment
,
and
Rebecca
's
heart
beat
quick
as
she
recognize
the
carriage
;
and
as
the
two
vehicle
cross
each
other
in
a
line
,
she
clasp
her
hand
,
and
look
towards
the
spinster
with
a
face
of
agonize
attachment
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
Rawdon
himself
tremble
,
and
his
face
grow
purple
behind
his
dyed
mustachio
.
 
<EOS>
only
old
Briggs
be
move
in
the
other
carriage
,
and
cast
her
great
eye
nervously
towards
her
old
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
's
bonnet
be
resolutely
turn
towards
the
Serpentine
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
happen
to
be
in
ecstasy
with
the
poodle
,
and
be
call
him
a
little
darling
,
and
a
sweet
little
zoggy
,
and
a
pretty
pet
.
 
<EOS>
the
carriage
move
on
,
each
in
his
line
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
,
by
jove
<EOS>
,
"
Rawdon
say
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
try
once
more
,
Rawdon
,
"
Rebecca
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Could
not
you
lock
your
wheel
into
theirs
,
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rawdon
have
not
the
heart
for
that
manoeuvre
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
carriage
meet
again
,
he
stand
up
in
his
stanhope
;
he
raise
his
hand
ready
to
doff
his
hat
;
he
look
with
all
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
time
Miss
Crawley
's
face
be
not
turn
away
;
she
and
Mrs.
Bute
look
him
full
in
the
face
,
and
cut
their
nephew
pitilessly
.
 
<EOS>
He
sink
back
in
his
seat
with
an
oath
,
and
strike
out
of
the
ring
,
dash
away
desperately
homeward
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
gallant
and
decide
triumph
for
Mrs.
Bute
.
<EOS>
but
she
feel
the
danger
of
many
such
meeting
,
as
she
see
the
evident
nervousness
of
Miss
Crawley
;
and
she
determine
that
it
be
most
necessary
for
her
dear
friend
's
health
,
that
they
should
leave
town
for
a
while
,
and
recommend
Brighton
very
strongly
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
Captain
Dobbin
Acts
as
the
Messenger
of
Hymen
 
without
know
how
,
Captain
William
Dobbin
find
himself
the
great
promoter
,
arranger
,
and
manager
of
the
match
between
George
Osborne
and
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
him
it
never
would
have
take
place
:
 
he
could
not
but
confess
as
much
to
himself
,
and
smile
rather
bitterly
as
he
think
that
he
of
all
man
in
the
world
should
be
the
person
upon
whom
the
care
of
this
marriage
have
fall
.
<EOS>
but
though
indeed
the
conducting
of
this
negotiation
be
about
as
painful
a
task
as
could
be
set
to
him
,
yet
when
he
have
a
duty
to
perform
,
Captain
Dobbin
be
accustomed
to
go
through
it
without
many
word
or
much
hesitation
:
and
,
have
make
up
his
mind
completely
,
that
if
Miss
Sedley
be
balk
of
her
husband
she
would
die
of
the
disappointment
,
he
be
determined
to
use
all
his
good
endeavour
to
keep
her
alive
.
  
<EOS>
I
forbear
to
enter
into
minute
particular
of
the
interview
between
George
and
Amelia
,
when
the
former
be
bring
back
to
the
foot
(
or
should
we
venture
to
say
the
arm
?
)
<EOS>
of
his
young
mistress
by
the
intervention
of
his
friend
honest
William
.
 
<EOS>
a
much
hard
heart
than
George
's
would
have
melt
at
the
sight
of
that
sweet
face
so
sadly
ravage
by
grief
and
despair
,
and
at
the
simple
tender
accent
in
which
she
tell
her
little
break
-
hearted
story
:
<EOS>
but
as
she
do
not
faint
when
her
mother
,
tremble
,
bring
Osborne
to
her
;
and
as
she
only
give
relief
to
her
overcharged
grief
,
by
lay
her
head
on
her
lover
's
shoulder
and
there
weep
for
a
while
the
most
tender
,
copious
,
and
refresh
tear
 
<EOS>
old
Mrs.
Sedley
,
too
greatly
relieved
,
think
it
be
good
to
leave
the
young
person
to
themselves
;
and
so
quitted
Emmy
cry
over
George
's
hand
,
and
kiss
it
humbly
,
as
if
he
be
her
supreme
chief
and
master
,
and
as
if
she
be
quite
a
guilty
and
unworthy
person
need
every
favour
and
grace
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
prostration
and
sweet
unrepining
obedience
exquisitely
touch
and
flatter
George
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
a
slave
before
him
in
that
simple
yield
faithful
creature
,
and
his
soul
within
him
thrill
secretly
somehow
at
the
knowledge
of
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
generous
-
minded
,
Sultan
as
he
be
,
and
raise
up
this
kneel
Esther
and
make
a
queen
of
her
:
 
<EOS>
besides
,
her
sadness
and
beauty
touch
him
as
much
as
her
submission
,
and
so
he
cheer
her
,
and
raise
her
up
and
forgave
her
,
so
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
all
her
hope
and
feeling
,
which
be
die
and
wither
,
this
her
sun
have
be
remove
from
her
,
bloom
again
and
at
once
,
its
light
be
restore
.
<EOS>
You
would
scarcely
have
recognise
the
beam
little
face
upon
Amelia
's
pillow
that
night
as
the
one
that
be
lay
there
the
night
before
,
so
wan
,
so
lifeless
,
<EOS>
so
careless
of
all
round
about
.
 
<EOS>
the
honest
irish
maid
-
servant
,
delight
with
the
change
,
ask
leave
to
kiss
the
face
that
have
grow
all
of
a
sudden
so
rosy
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
put
her
arm
round
the
girl
's
neck
and
kiss
her
with
all
her
heart
,
like
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
little
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
that
night
a
sweet
refreshing
sleep
,
like
one
 
and
what
a
spring
of
inexpressible
happiness
as
she
wake
in
the
morning
sunshine
!
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
here
again
to
-
day
,
"
Amelia
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
great
and
good
of
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
fact
be
,
that
George
think
he
be
one
of
the
generous
creature
alive
:
and
that
he
be
make
a
tremendous
sacrifice
in
marry
this
young
creature
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
and
Osborne
be
have
their
delightful
tete
-
a
-
tete
above
stair
,
old
Mrs.
Sedley
and
Captain
Dobbin
be
converse
below
upon
the
state
of
the
affair
,
and
the
chance
and
future
arrangement
of
the
young
people

<EOS>
Mrs.
Sedley
have
bring
the
two
lover
together
and
leave
them
embrace
each
other
with
all
their
might
,
like
a
true
woman
,
be
of
opinion
that
no
power
on
earth
would
induce
Mr.
Sedley
to
consent
to
the
match
between
his
daughter
and
the
son
of
a
man
who
have
so
shamefully
,
wickedly
,
and
monstrously
treat
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
tell
a
long
story
about
happy
day
and
their
early
splendour
,
when
Osborne
live
in
a
very
humble
way
in
the
New
Road
,
and
his
wife
be
too
glad
to
receive
some
of
Jos
's
little
baby
thing
,
with
which
Mrs.
Sedley
accommodate
her
at
the
birth
of
one
of
Osborne
's
own
child
.
<EOS>
the
fiendish
ingratitude
of
that
man
,
she
be
sure
,
have
break
Mr.
S."s
heart
:
and
as
for
a
marriage
,
he
would
never
,
never
,
never
,
never
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
run
away
together
,
madam
,
"
Dobbin
say
,
laugh
,
"
and
follow
the
example
of
Captain
Rawdon
Crawley
,
and
Miss
Emmy
's
friend
the
little
governess
.
"
<EOS>
be
it
possible
?
<EOS>
well
she
never
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sedley
be
all
excitement
about
this
news
.
 
<EOS>
She
wish
that
Blenkinsop
be
here
to
hear
it
:
 
<EOS>
Blenkinsop
always
mistrust
that
Miss
Sharp
.
  
<EOS>
what
an
escape
Jos
have
have
!
<EOS>
and
she
describe
the
already
well
-
know
love
-
passage
between
Rebecca
and
the
Collector
of
Boggley
Wollah
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
however
,
Mr.
Sedley
's
wrath
which
Dobbin
fear
,
so
much
as
that
of
the
other
parent
concern
,
and
he
own
that
he
have
a
very
considerable
doubt
and
anxiety
respect
the
behaviour
of
the
black
-
browe
old
tyrant
of
a
Russia
merchant
in
Russell
Square
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
forbid
the
match
peremptorily
,
Dobbin
think
.
<EOS>
He
know
what
a
savage
determined
man
Osborne
be
,
and
how
he
stick
by
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
the
only
chance
George
have
of
reconcilement

if

in
distinction
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
some
money
from
his
mother
,
I
have
hear
enough
to
purchase
his
majority
 
or
he
must
sell
out
and
go
and
dig
in
Canada
,
or
rough
it
in
a
cottage
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
such
a
partner
Dobbin
think
he
would
not
mind
Siberia
 
and
,
strange
to
say
,
this
absurd
and
utterly
imprudent
young
fellow
never
for
a
moment
consider
that
the
want
of
mean
to
keep
a
nice
carriage
and
horse
,
and
of
an
income
which
should
enable
its
possessor
to
entertain
their
friend
genteelly
,
ought
to
operate
as
bar
to
the
union
of
George
and
Miss
Sedley
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
these
weighty
consideration
which
make
him
think
too
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
as
quickly
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
be
he
anxious
himself
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
to
have
it
over
?
 
<EOS>
as
people
,
when
death
have
occur
,
like
to
press
forward
the
funeral
,
or
when
a
parting
be
resolve
upon
,
hasten
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
Mr.
Dobbin
,
have
take
the
matter
in
hand
,
be
most
extraordinarily
eager
in
the
conduct
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
urge
on
George
the
necessity
of
immediate
action
:
 
<EOS>
he
show
the
chance
of
reconciliation
with
his
father
,
which
a
favourable
mention
of
his
name
in
the
Gazette
must
bring
about
.
 
<EOS>
if
need
be
he
would
go
himself
and
brave
both
the
father
in
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
he
beseech
George
to
go
through
with
it
before
the
order
come
,
which
everybody
expect
,
for
the
departure
of
the
regiment
from
England
on
foreign
service
.
  
<EOS>
bent
upon
these
hymeneal
project
,
and
with
the
applause
and
consent
of
Mrs.
Sedley
,
who
do
not
care
to
break
the
matter
personally
to
her
husband
,
Mr.
Dobbin
go
to
seek
John
Sedley
at
his
house
of
call
in
the
City
,
the
Tapioca
Coffee
-
house
,
where
,
since
his
own
office
be
shut
up
,
and
fate
have
overtake
him
,
the
poor
break
-
down
old
gentleman
use
to
betake
himself
daily
,
and
write
letter
and
receive
them
,
and
tie
them
up
into
mysterious
bundle
,
several
of
which
he
carry
in
the
flap
of
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
anything
more
dismal
than
that
business
and
bustle
and
mystery
of
a
ruined
man
:
 
<EOS>
those
letter
from
the
wealthy
which
he
show
you
:
 
those
wear
greasy
document
promise
support
and
offer
condolence
which
he
place
wistfully
before
you
,
and
on
which
he
build
his
hope
of
restoration
and
future
fortune
.
<EOS>
My
beloved
reader
have
no
doubt
in
the
course
of
his
experience
be
waylay
by
many
such
a
luckless
companion
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
you
into
the
corner
;
he
have
his
bundle
of
paper
out
of
his
gape
coat
pocket
;
and
the
tape
off
,
and
the
string
in
his
mouth
,
and
the
favourite
letter
select
and
lay
before
you
;
and
who
do
not
know
the
sad
eager
half
-
crazy
look
which
he
fix
on
you
with
his
hopeless
eye
?
  
<EOS>
change
into
a
man
of
this
sort
,
Dobbin
find
the
once
florid
,
jovial
,
and
prosperous
John
Sedley
.
 
<EOS>
His
coat
,
that
use
to
be
so
glossy
and
trim
,
be
white
at
the
seam
,
and
the
button
show
the
copper
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
have
fall
in
,
and
be
unshorn
;
his
frill
and
neckcloth
hang
limp
under
his
bagging
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
use
to
treat
the
boy
in
old
day
at
a
coffee
-
house
,
he
would
shout
and
laugh
louder
than
anybody
there
,
and
have
all
the
waiter
skip
round
him
;
it
be
quite
painful
to
see
how
humble
and
civil
he
be
to
John
of
the
Tapioca
,
a
blear
-
eyed
old
attendant
in
dingy
stocking
and
crack
pump
,
whose
business
it
be
to
serve
glass
of
wafer
,
and
bumper
of
ink
in
pewter
,
and
slice
of
paper
to
the
frequenter
of
this
dreary
house
of
entertainment
,
where
nothing
else
seem
to
be
consume
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
William
Dobbin
,
whom
he
have
tip
repeatedly
in
his
youth
,
and
who
have
be
the
old
gentleman
's
butt
on
a
thousand
occasion
,
old
Sedley
give
his
hand
to
him
in
a
very
hesitating
humble
manner
now
,
and
call
him
"
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
feeling
of
shame
and
remorse
take
possession
of
William
Dobbin
as
the
broken
old
man
so
receive
and
address
him
,
as
if
he
himself
have
be
somehow
guilty
of
the
misfortune
which
have
bring
Sedley
so
low
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
,
Captain
Dobbin
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
after
a
skulk
look
or
two
at
his
visitor
(
whose
lanky
figure
and
military
appearance
cause
some
excitement
likewise
to
twinkle
in
the
blear
eye
of
the
waiter
in
the
cracked
dancing
pump
,
and
awaken
the
old
lady
in
black
,
who
doze
among
the
mouldy
old
coffee
-
cup
in
the
bar
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
the
worthy
alderman
,
and
my
lady
,
your
excellent
mother
,
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
look
round
at
the
waiter
as
he
say
,
"
My
lady
,
"
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Hark
ye
,
John
,
I
have
friend
still
,
and
person
of
rank
and
reputation
,
too

"
 
<EOS>
"
be
you
come
to
do
anything
in
my
way

<EOS>
My
young
friend
Dale
and
Spiggot
do
all
my
business
for
me
now
,
until
my
new
office
be
ready
;
for
I
be
only
here
temporarily
,
you
know
,
Captain
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
we
do
for
you
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
like
to
take
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dobbin
,
with
a
great
deal
of
hesitation
and
stuttering
,
protest
that
he
be
not
in
the
least
hungry
or
thirsty
;
that
he
have
no
business
to
transact
;
that
he
only
come
to
ask
if
Mr.
Sedley
be
well
,
and
to
shake
hand
with
an
old
friend
;
and
,
he
add
,
with
a
desperate
perversion
of
truth
,
"
My
mother
be
very
well
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
she
be
be
very
unwell
,
and
be
only
wait
for
the
first
fine
day
to
go
out
and
call
upon
Mrs.
Sedley

<EOS>
how
be
Mrs.
Sedley
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
she
be
quite
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
here
he
pause
,
reflect
on
his
own
consummate
hypocrisy
;
for
the
day
be
as
fine
,
and
the
sunshine
as
bright
as
it
ever
be
in
Coffin
Court
,
where
the
Tapioca
Coffee
-
house
be
situate
:
and
Mr.
Dobbin
remember
that
he
have
see
Mrs.
Sedley
himself
only
an
hour
before
,
have
drive
Osborne
down
to
Fulham
in
his
gig
,
and
leave
him
there
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
Miss
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
wife
will
be
very
happy
to
see
her
ladyship
,
"
Sedley
reply
,
pull
out
his
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
very
kind
letter
here
from
your
father
,
sir
,
and
beg
my
respectful
compliment
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
D.
will
find
us
in
rather
a
small
house
than
we
be
accustomed
to
receive
our
friend
in
;
but
it
be
snug
,
and
the
change
of
air
do
good
to
my
daughter

who
be
suffer
in
town

rather
 
you
remember
little
Emmy

<EOS>
yes

suffer
a
good
deal

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
's
eye
be
wander
as
he
speak
,
and
he
be
think
of
something
else
,
as
he
sate
thrum
on
his
paper
and
fumble
at
the
worn
red
tape
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
military

he
go
on

"
I
ask
you
,
Bill
Dobbin
,
could
any
man
ever
have
speculate
upon
the
return
of
that
corsican
scoundrel
from
Elba
?
 
<EOS>
when
the
ally
sovereign
be
here
last
year

we
give
'em
that
dinner
in
the
City

sir

we
see
the
Temple
of
Concord
,
and
the
firework
,
and
the
chinese
bridge
in
St.
James
's
Park
,
could
any
sensible
man
suppose
that
peace
be
not
really
conclude
,
after
we
would
actually
sing
Te
Deum
for
it
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
I
ask
you
,
William
,
<EOS>
could
I
suppose
that
the
Emperor
of
Austria
be
a
damned
traitor
 
a
traitor
,
and
nothing
more
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mince
word
 
a
double

infernal
traitor
and
schemer
,
who
mean
to
have
his
son
-
in

law
back
all
along
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
that
the
escape
of
Boney
from
Elba
be
a
damned
imposition
and
plot
,
sir
,
in
which
half
the
power
of
Europe

to
bring
the

down

why
I

here

<EOS>
that
be
why
my
name
be
in

<EOS>
why

because
I

the
Emperor

up

what

perhaps
he

do
he

very

the

I
curse
the

him
into

she
be
just
as
much
married
as
if
the

read

London

and
what
well
answer
can
there
be
to
Osborne

there
be

than
that
his

enter
your

marry
your

<EOS>
a
light
of
something
like
satisfaction
seem
to
break
over
old
Sedley
as
this
point
be
put
to
him

he
still
persist
that
with
his
consent
the
marriage
between
Amelia

George
should
never
take
place

<EOS>
"
We
must
do
it
without

Dobbin
say

smile

tell
Mr.

he
have
tell
Mrs.

before

the
story
of
Rebecca

evidently
amuse
the

You
be
terrible
fellow

say
he
,
tie
up
his
paper

his
face
wear
something
like
a
smile
upon
it

to
the
astonishment
of
the
blear

eyed
waiter
who
now
enter

have
never

an
expression
upon
Sedley

use
the
dismal
coffee

the
idea

hit
his
enemy
Osborne
such
a
blow
soothe

perhaps
,
the

their
colloquy
presently
end

pretty
good

the

<EOS>
there
be
little
doubt
that
old
Osborne
believe
all
he
say
,
and
that
the

be
quite
earnest
in
their
protestation
of
affection
for
Miss

People
in
Vanity
Fair
fasten
on

rich
folk

naturally

<EOS>
if
the
simple
people
be
dispose
to
look
not
a
little
kindly
on
great
prosperity
(
for
I
defy
any
member
of

british
public
to
say
that
the

Their

awaken
spontaneously

indulge
in
friendship
for
any
individual
who
have
not
a

place

They
give
a
loose
to
their
feeling
on
proper
occasion

the
proof
be
,
that
the
major
part

the
osborne
family

who
have
not
,
in
fifteen
year
,
be
able
to
get
up
a
hearty
regard
for
Amelia
Sedley

become
as
fond
of
Miss
Swartz
in
the
course
of
a
single
evening

the
most
romantic
advocate

<EOS>
such
a

young
fellow

who
talk

nothing

George

grand
acquaintance

Old
Osborne
think
she
would
be

great
match

too

for
his
son

He
should
leave

he
should
go
into
Parliament

he
should
cut
a
figure
in
the
fashion

in

His

boil
with
honest
british
exultation

he
see
the
name

ennoble

Young

the

though
,
when
Osborne
have
leave
the
bank
parlour

Mr.
Bullock
remember
Amelia
,

what
a
pretty
girl
she
be

how
attach
to
George
Osborne

he
give
up
at

ten
second
of
his
valuable
time

regret
the
misfortune
which
have
befall
that
unlucky
young
woman

while
thus
George

good
feeling

his
good
friend

genius

Dobbin

truant

foot

George
's
parent

arrange
this
splendid
match
for
him

which
they
never

he
would
resist

when
the
eld
osborne
give
what
he
call
"
a
hint

there
be
no
possibility
for
the
most
obtuse
to
mistake
his
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
He
call
kick
a
footman
downstairs
a
hint
to
the
latter
to
leave
his
service
.
<EOS>
with
his
usual
frankness
and
delicacy
he
tell
Mrs.
Haggistoun
that
he
would
give
her
a
cheque
for
five
thousand
pound
on
the
day
his
son
be
married
to
her
ward
;
and
call
that
proposal
a
hint
,
and
consider
it
a
very
dexterous
piece
of
diplomacy
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
George
finally
such
another
hint
regard
the
heiress
;
and
order
him
to
marry
her
out
of
hand
,
as
he
would
have
order
his
butler
to
draw
a
cork
,
or
his
clerk
to
write
a
letter

<EOS>
this
imperative
hint
disturb
George
a
good
deal

<EOS>
He
be
in
the
very
first
enthusiasm
and
delight
of
his
second
courtship
of
Amelia

which
be
inexpressibly
sweet
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
contrast
of
her
manner
and
appearance
with
those
of
the
heiress
,
make
the
idea
of
a
union
with
the
latter
appear
doubly
ludicrous
and
odious

be
see
in
them
by
the
side
of
such
a
mahogany
charmer
as
that
!
 
<EOS>
add
to
all
that
the
junior
Osborne
be
quite
as
obstinate
as
the
senior
:
when
he
want
a
thing
,
quite
as
firm
in
his
resolution
to
get
it
;
and
quite
as
violent
when
anger
,
as
his
father
in
his
most
stern
moment
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
first
day
when
his
father
formally
give
him
the
hint
that
he
be
to
place
his
affection
at
Miss
Swartz
's
foot
,
George
temporise
with
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
think
of
the
matter
sooner
,
sir
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
do
now
,
when
we
be
expect
every
day
to
go
on
foreign
service
.
 
<EOS>
wait
till
my
return
,
if
I
do
return
"
<EOS>
;
and
then
he
represent
,
that
the
time
when
the
regiment
be
daily
expect
to
quit
England
,
be
exceedingly
ill
-
choose
:
that
the
few
day
or
week
during
which
they
be
still
to
remain
at
home
,
must
be
devoted
to
business
and
not
to
love
-
make
:
time
enough
for
that
when
he
come
home
with
his
majority
;
"
for
,
I
promise
you
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
satisfied
air
,
"
that
one
way
or
other
you
shall
read
the
name
of
George
Osborne
in
the
Gazette
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
father
's
reply
to
this
be
found
upon
the
information
which
he
have
get
in
the
City
:
that
the
West
End
chaps
would
infallibly
catch
hold
of
the
heiress
if
any
delay
take
place
:
that
if
he
do
not
marry
Miss
S.
,
he
may
at
least
have
an
engagement
in
writing
,
to
come
into
effect
when
he
return
to
England
;
and
that
a
man
who
could
get
ten
thousand
a
year
by
stay
at
home
,
be
a
fool
to
risk
his
life
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
that
you
would
have
me
show
up
as
a
coward
,
sir
,
and
our
name
dishonour
for
the
sake
of
Miss
Swartz
's
money
,
"
George
interpose
.
  
<EOS>
this
remark
stagger
the
old
gentleman
;
but
as
he
have
to
reply
to
it
,
and
as
his
mind
be
nevertheless
make
up
,
he
say
,
"
You
will
dine
here
to
-
morrow
,
sir
,
and
every
day
Miss
Swartz
come
,
you
will
be
here
to
pay
your
respect
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
want
for
money
,
call
upon
Mr.
Chopper
.
"
<EOS>
thus
a
new
obstacle
be
in
George
's
way
,
to
interfere
with
his
plan
regard
Amelia
;
and
about
which
he
and
Dobbin
have
more
than
one
confidential
consultation
.
 
<EOS>
His
friend
's
opinion
respect
the
line
of
conduct
which
he
ought
to
pursue
<EOS>
,
we
know
already
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
for
Osborne
,
when
he
be
once
bent
on
a
thing
,
a
fresh
obstacle
or
two
only
render
him
the
more
resolute
.
  
<EOS>
the
dark
object
of
the
conspiracy
into
which
the
chief
of
the
Osborne
family
have
enter
,
be
quite
ignorant
of
all
their
plan
regard
her
(
which
,
strange
to
say
,
her
friend
and
chaperon
do
not
divulge
)
,
and
,
take
all
the
young
lady
'
flattery
for
genuine
sentiment
,
and
be
,
as
we
have
before
have
occasion
to
show
,
of
a
very
warm
and
impetuous
nature
,
respond
to
their
affection
with
quite
a
tropical
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
the
truth
may
be
tell
,
I
dare
say
that
she
too
have
some
selfish
attraction
in
the
Russell
Square
house
;
and
in
a
word
,
think
George
Osborne
a
very
nice
young
man
.
<EOS>
His
whisker
have
make
an
impression
upon
her
,
on
the
very
first
night
she
behold
them
at
the
ball
at
Messrs.
Hulkers
;
and
,
as
we
know
,
she
be
not
the
first
woman
who
have
be
charm
by
them
.
<EOS>
George
have
an
air
at
once
swaggering
and
melancholy
,
languid
and
fierce
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
like
a
man
who
have
passion
,
secret
,
and
private
harrowing
griefs
and
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
His
voice
be
rich
and
deep
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
say
it
be
a
warm
evening
,
or
ask
his
partner
to
take
an
ice
,
with
a
tone
as
sad
and
confidential
as
if
he
be
break
her
mother
's
death
to
her
,
or
prelude
a
declaration
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
trample
over
all
the
young
buck
of
his
father
's
circle
,
and
be
the
hero
among
those
third
-
rate
man
.
 
<EOS>
some
few
sneer
at
him
and
hate
him
.
<EOS>
some
,
like
Dobbin
,
fanatically
admire
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
his
whisker
have
begin
to
do
their
work
,
and
to
curl
themselves
round
the
affection
of
Miss
Swartz
.
  
<EOS>
whenever
there
be
a
chance
of
meet
him
in
Russell
Square
,
that
simple
and
good
-
natured
young
woman
be
quite
in
a
flurry
to
see
her
dear
Misses
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
to
great
expense
in
new
gown
,
and
bracelet
,
and
bonnet
,
and
in
prodigious
feather
.
 
<EOS>
She
adorn
her
person
with
her
utmost
skill
to
please
the
Conqueror
,
and
exhibit
all
her
simple
accomplishment
to
win
his
favour
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
would
ask
her
,
with
the
great
gravity
,
for
a
little
music
,
and
she
would
sing
her
three
song
and
play
her
two
little
piece
as
often
as
ever
they
ask
,
and
with
an
always
increase
pleasure
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
during
these
delectable
entertainment
,
Miss
Wirt
and
the
chaperon
sate
by
,
and
con
over
the
peerage
,
and
talk
about
the
nobility
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
after
George
have
his
hint
from
his
father
,
and
a
short
time
before
the
hour
of
dinner
,
he
be
loll
upon
a
sofa
in
the
drawing

room
in
a
very
becoming
and
perfectly
natural
attitude
of
melancholy

<EOS>
He
have
be

at
his

request

Mr.

in
the

(
the
old

gentleman
,
though
he
give
great
sum
to

would
never
specify
any
fix
allowance
for
him
,
and
reward
him
only
as
he
be

.
 
<EOS>
He
have
then
be

his

Fulham

he
come

their

their

the

the

have
thrice
the
nerve

resist
it

the

take

It
make

half

open
the

fill
himself
a
glass
of
wine

smack
it
,
and
look
his

full

Captain
Dobbin
Proceeds
on
His
canvass
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
secret
mesmerism
which
friendship
possess

and
under
the
operation
of
which
a
person
ordinarily
sluggish

or
cold

or
timid

become
wise
,
active
,
and
resolute
,
in
another

<EOS>
as
Alexis

after
a
few
pass
from
Dr.

despise

read
with
the
back

,
see
mile
off

look

and
perform
other
wonder

of
which
,
in
his

private
normal

he
be
quite
incapable
;
so
you
see
,
in
the
affair
of
the
world
and
under
the
magnetism
of
friendship
,
the
modest
man
become
bold
,
the
shy
confident

the
lazy
active

or
the
impetuous
prudent

peaceful

<EOS>
what
be
it

on

that
make
the
lawyer
eschew
his

write
his

<EOS>
I
throw
out
these
query
for
intelligent
reader
to
answer
,
who
know
,
at
once
,
how
credulous
we
be
,
and
how
sceptical
,
how
soft
and
how
obstinate
,
how
firm
for
other
and
how
diffident
about
ourselves
:
 
meanwhile
<EOS>
,
it
be
certain
that
our
friend
William
Dobbin
,
who
be
personally
of
so
comply
a
disposition
that
if
his
parent
have
press
him
much
,
it
be
probable
he
would
have
step
down
into
the
kitchen
and
marry
the
cook
,
and
who
,
to
further
his
own
interest
,
would
have
find
the
most
insuperable
difficulty
in
walk
across
the
street
,
find
himself
as
busy
and
eager
in
the
conduct
of
George
Osborne
's
affair
,
as
the
most
selfish
tactician
could
be
in
the
pursuit
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
our
friend
George
and
his
young
wife
be
enjoy
the
first
blush
day
of
the
honeymoon
at
Brighton
,
honest
William
be
leave
as
George
's
plenipotentiary
in
London
,
to
transact
all
the
business
part
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
His
duty
it
be
to
call
upon
old
Sedley
and
his
wife
,
and
to
keep
the
former
in
good
humour
:
 
to
draw
Jos
and
his
brother
-
in
-
law
nearer
together
,
so
that
Jos
's
position
and
dignity
,
as
collector
of
Boggley
Wollah
,
may
compensate
for
his
father
's
loss
of
station
,
and
tend
to
reconcile
old
Osborne
to
the
alliance
:
 
and
finally
,
to
communicate
it
to
the
latter
in
such
a
way
as
should
least
irritate
the
old
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
before
he
face
the
head
of
the
osborne
house
with
the
news
which
it
be
his
duty
to
tell
,
Dobbin
bethink
him
that
it
would
be
politic
to
make
friend
of
the
rest
of
the
family
,
and
,
if
possible
,
have
the
lady
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
be
angry
in
their
heart
,
think
he
.
<EOS>
no
woman
ever
be
really
angry
at
a
romantic
marriage
.
<EOS>
a
little
cry
out
,
and
they
must
come
round
to
their
brother
;
when
the
three
of
us
will
lay
siege
to
old
Mr.
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
so
this
machiavellian
captain
of
infantry
cast
about
him
for
some
happy
mean
or
stratagem
by
which
he
could
gently
and
gradually
bring
the
Misses
osborne
to
a
knowledge
of
their
brother
's
secret
.
  
<EOS>
by
a
little
inquiry
regard
his
mother
's
engagement
,
he
be
pretty
soon
able
to
find
out
by
whom
of
her
ladyship
's
friend
party
be
give
at
that
season
;
where
he
would
be
likely
to
meet
Osborne
's
sister
;
and
,
though
he
have
that
abhorrence
of
rout
and
evening
party
which
many
sensible
man
,
alas
!
<EOS>
entertain
,
he
soon
find
one
where
the
Misses
Osborne
be
to
be
present
.
<EOS>
make
his
appearance
at
the
ball
,
where
he
dance
a
couple
of
set
with
both
of
them
,
and
be
prodigiously
polite
,
he
actually
have
the
courage
to
ask
Miss
Osborne
for
a
few
minute
'
conversation
at
an
early
hour
the
next
day
,
when
he
have
,
he
say
,
to
communicate
to
her
news
of
the
very
great
interest
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
it
that
make
her
start
back
,
and
gaze
upon
him
for
a
moment
,
and
then
on
the
ground
at
her
foot
,
and
make
as
if
she
would
faint
on
his
arm
,
have
he
not
by
opportunely
tread
on
her
toe
,
bring
the
young
lady
back
to
self
-
control
?
 
<EOS>
why
be
she
so
violently
agitate
at
Dobbin
's
request
?
 
<EOS>
this
can
never
be
know
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
come
the
next
day
,
Maria
be
not
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
her
sister
,
and
Miss
Wirt
go
off
for
the
purpose
of
fetch
the
latter
,
and
the
Captain
and
Miss
Osborne
be
leave
together
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
so
silent
that
the
ticktock
of
the
Sacrifice
of
Iphigenia
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
become
quite
rudely
audible
.
  
<EOS>
"
what

Miss

at
length

o

<EOS>
"
upon
my

she
be
play

Miss

merely
parenthetic

be
not

now
come
to
the
point

nervousness

twitching

rapid
buttoning

c.
 
Miss

I
say

think
that
when

give
himself
a

he
would
unbosom
himself
entirely

prepare
eagerly

after

to

discomfit

<EOS>
when

Mr.

,
and
after
the
first
word

of
hesitation

he
could

that

at

he
have
find

<EOS>
It
be

she
continue

I
feel
for

We

"
  
<EOS>
this
adroit
question
touch
the
heart
of
Miss

Osborne
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
we
poor

ought
to
believe
what
you

"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
that
in
woman

tenderness
which
induce
her
to
believe
too
easily
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
you
be
cruel
,
cruel
deceiver
,
"
 
and
Dobbin
<EOS>
certainly
think
he
feel
a
pressure
of
the
hand
which
Miss
Osborne
have
extend
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
drop
it
in
some
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
deceiver
!
"
say
he
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
dear
Miss
Osborne
,
all
man
be
not
;
your
brother
be
not
;
George
have
love
Amelia
Sedley
ever
since
they
be
child
;
no
wealth
would
make
him
marry
any
but
her
.
 
<EOS>
Ought
he
to
forsake
her
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
counsel
him
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
could
Miss
Jane
say
to
such
a
question
,
and
with
her
own
peculiar
view
?
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
answer
it
,
so
she
parry
it
by
say
,
"
well
,
if
you
be
not
a
deceiver
,
at
least
you
be
very
romantic
"
;
and
Captain
William
let
this
observation
pass
without
challenge
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
when
,
by
the
help
of
farther
polite
speech
,
he
deem
that
Miss
Osborne
be
sufficiently
prepared
to
receive
the
whole
news
,
he
pour
it
into
her
ear
.
"
<EOS>
George
could
not
give
up
Amelia
 
<EOS>
George
be
married
to
her
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
relate
the
circumstance
of
the
marriage
as
we
know
them
already
:
 
<EOS>
how
the
poor
girl
would
have
die
have
not
her
lover
keep
his
faith
:
 
how
Old
Sedley
have
refuse
all
consent
to
the
match
,
and
a
licence
have
be
get
:
and
Jos
Sedley
have
come
from
Cheltenham
to
give
away
the
bride
:
how
they
have
go
to
Brighton
in
Jos
's
chariot
-
and
-
four
to
pass
the
honeymoon
:
and
how
George
count
on
his
dear
kind
sister
to
befriend
him
with
their
father
,
as
woman
 
so
true
and
tender
as
they
be
 
assuredly
would
do
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
ask
permission
(
readily
grant
)
to
see
her
again
,
and
rightly
conjecture
that
the
news
he
have
bring
would
be
tell
in
the
next
five
minute
to
the
other
lady
,
Captain
Dobbin
make
his
bow
and
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
scarcely
out
of
the
house
,
when
Miss
Maria
and
Miss
Wirt
rush
in
to
Miss
Osborne
,
and
the
whole
wonderful
secret
be
impart
to
them
by
that
lady
.
 
<EOS>
to
do
them
justice
,
neither
of
the
sister
be
very
much
displeased
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
about
a
runaway
match
with
which
few
lady
can
be
seriously
angry
,
and
Amelia
rather
rise
in
their
estimation
,
from
the
spirit
which
she
have
display
in
consent
to
the
union
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
debate
the
story
,
and
prattle
about
it
,
and
wonder
what
Papa
would
do
and
say
,
come
a
loud
knock
,
as
of
an
avenge
thunder
-
clap
,
at
the
door
,
which
make
these
conspirator
start
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
Papa
,
they
think
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
he
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
Mr.
Frederick
Bullock
,
who
have
come
from
the
City
accord
to
appointment
,
to
conduct
the
lady
to
a
flower
-
show
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
as
may
be
imagine
,
be
not
keep
long
in
ignorance
of
the
secret
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
face
,
when
he
hear
it
,
show
an
amazement
which
be
very
different
to
that
look
of
sentimental
wonder
which
the
countenance
of
the
sister
wear
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bullock
be
a
man
of
the
world
,
and
a
junior
partner
of
a
wealthy
firm
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
what
money
be
,
and
the
value
of
it
:
and
a
delightful
throb
of
expectation
light
up
his
little
eye
,
and
cause
him
to
smile
on
his
Maria
,
as
he
think
that
by
this
piece
of
folly
of
Mr.
George
's
she
may
be
worth
thirty
thousand
pound
more
than
he
have
ever
hope
to
get
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gad
!
 
Jane
,
"
say
he
,
survey
even
the
eld
sister
with
some
interest
,
"
eel
will
be
sorry
he
cry
off
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
a
fifty
thousand
pounder
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
sister
have
never
think
of
the
money
question
up
to
that
moment
,
but
Fred
Bullock
banter
them
with
graceful
gaiety
about
it
during
their
forenoon
's
excursion
;
and
they
have
rise
not
a
little
in
their
own
esteem
by
the
time
when
,
the
morning
amusement
over
,
they
drive
back
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
and
do
not
let
my
respected
reader
exclaim
against
this
selfishness
as
unnatural
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
but
this
present
morning
,
as
he
ride
on
the
omnibus
from
Richmond
;
while
it
change
horse
,
this
present
chronicler
,
be
on
the
roof
,
mark
three
little
child
play
in
a
puddle
below
,
very
dirty
,
and
friendly
,
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
to
these
three
presently
come
another
little
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
POLLY
,
"
say
she
,
"
your

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
the
child
get
up
from
the
puddle
instantly
,
and
run
off
to
pay
their
court
to
Peggy
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
the
omnibus
drive
off
I
see
Peggy
with
the
infantine
procession
at
her
tail
,
march
with
great
dignity
towards
the
stall
of
a
neighbouring
lollipop
-
woman
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
Mr.
Osborne
take
down
the
Family
Bible
 
so
have
prepare
the
sister
,
Dobbin
hasten
away
to
the
City
to
perform
the
rest
and
more
difficult
part
of
the
task
which
he
have
undertake
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
face
old
Osborne
render
him
not
a
little
nervous
,
and
more
than
once
he
think
of
leave
the
young
lady
to
communicate
the
secret
,
which
,
as
he
be
aware
,
they
could
not
long
retain
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
promise
to
report
to
George
upon
the
manner
in
which
the
eld
osborne
bear
the
intelligence
;
<EOS>
so
go
into
the
City
to
the
paternal
counting
-
house
in
Thames
Street
,
he
despatch
thence
a
note
to
Mr.
Osborne
beg
for
a
half
-
hour
's
conversation
relative
to
the
affair
of
his
son
George
.
 
<EOS>
Dobbin
's
messenger
return
from
Mr.
Osborne
's
house
of
business
,
with
the
compliment
of
the
latter
,
who
would
be
very
happy
to
see
the
Captain
immediately
,
and
away
accordingly
Dobbin
go
to
confront
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
,
with
a
half
-
guilty
secret
to
confess
,
and
with
the
prospect
of
a
painful
and
stormy
interview
before
him
,
enter
Mr.
Osborne
's
office
with
a
most
dismal
countenance
and
abash
gait
,
and
,
pass
through
the
outer
room
where
Mr.
Chopper
preside
,
be
greet
by
that
functionary
from
his
desk
with
a
waggish
air
which
farther
discomfit
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chopper
wink
and
nod
and
point
his
pen
towards
his
patron
's
door
,
and
say
,
"
You
will
find
the
governor
all
right
,
"
with
the
most
provoking
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
Osborne
rise
too
,
and
shake
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
"
how
do
,
my
dear
boy
?
"
with
a
cordiality
that
make
poor
George
's
ambassador
feel
doubly
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
His
hand
lie
as
if
dead
in
the
old
gentleman
's
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
,
Dobbin
,
be
more
or
less
the
cause
of
all
that
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
he
have
bring
back
George
to
Amelia
<EOS>
:
it
be
he
have
applaud
,
encourage
,
transact
almost
the
marriage

be
come
to
reveal
to
George
's
father

and
the
latter

receive
him
with
smile
of
welcome
;
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
call
him
"
Dobbin

my
dear
boy

<EOS>
"
the
envoy
have
indeed
good
reason
to
hang
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
Osborne
fully
believe
that
Dobbin
have
come
to
announce
his
son
's
surrender
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Chopper
and
his
principal
be
talk
over
the
matter
between
George
and
his
father
,
at
the
very
moment
when
Dobbin
's
messenger
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
both
agree
that
George
be
send
in
his
submission
.
 
<EOS>
both
have
be
expect
it
for
some
day
 
and
"
Lord

what
a
marriage
we
will
have

<EOS>
Mr.
Osborne
say
to
his
clerk

snap
his
big
finger
,
and
jingle
all
the
guinea
and
shilling
in
his
great
pocket
as
he
eye
his
subordinate

a
look
of
triumph

<EOS>
with
similar
operation
conduct
in
both
pocket

and
a
know
jolly
air
,
Osborne
from
his
chair
regard
Dobbin
seat
blank
and
silent
opposite
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
bumpkin
he
be
for
a
captain
in
the
army
,

old
osborne
think

<EOS>
"
I
wonder
George
have
not
teach
him
well
manner

"
  
<EOS>
at
last
Dobbin
summon
courage
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
bring
you
some
very
grave
news
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
at
the
Horse
Guards
this
morning
,
and
there
be
no
doubt
that
our
regiment
will
be
order
abroad
,
and
on
its
way
to
Belgium
before
the
week
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
know
,
sir
,
that
we
shall
not
be
home
again
before
a
tussle
which
may
be
fatal
to
many
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Osborne
look
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
s
 
,
the
regiment
will
do
its
duty
,
sir
,
I
daresay
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
French
be
very
strong
,
sir
,
"
Dobbin
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
the
Russians
and
Austrians
will
be
a
long
time
before
they
can
bring
their
troop
down
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
the
first
of
the
fight
,
sir
;
and
depend
on
it
<EOS>
Boney
will
take
care
that
it
shall
be
a
hard
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
drive
at
,
Dobbin
?
<EOS>
"
his
interlocutor
say
,
uneasy
and
with
a
scowl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
no
Briton
's
afraid
of
any
d
#
#
#
#
Frenchman
,
hey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
mean
,
that
before
we
go
,
and
consider
the
great
and
certain
risk
that
hang
over
every
one
of
us
 
if
there
be
any
difference
between
you
and
George
 
it
would
be
as
well
,
sir
,
that
 
that
you
should
shake
hand
:
<EOS>
would
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
Should
anything
happen
to
him
,
I
think
you
would
never
forgive
yourself
if
you
have
not
part
in
charity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
say
this
,
poor
William
Dobbin
blush
crimson
,
and
feel
and
own
that
he
himself
be
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
him
,
perhaps
,
this
severance
nee
never
have
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
not
George
's
marriage
be
delay
?
<EOS>
what
call
be
there
to
press
it
on
so
eagerly
?
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
George
would
have
part
from
Amelia
at
any
rate
without
a
mortal
pang
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
,
too
,
may
have
recover
the
shock
of
lose
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
counsel
have
bring
about
this
marriage
,
and
all
that
be
to
ensue
from
it
.
<EOS>
and
why
be
it
?
<EOS>
because
he
love
her
so
much
that
he
could
not
bear
to
see
her
unhappy
:
 
or
because
his
own
suffering
of
suspense
be
so
unendurable
that
he
be
glad
to
crush
them
at
once
 
as

there

not

It

remark
that
Mr.

quiet

gentle
all

to
the
surprise
of
those
who
have
augur
ill

<EOS>
He

He

him
,
after
some

request
the
latter

deliver
it

immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"

now
,
Chopper

"
say
he
,
take
his
hat

with
a
strange
look
,
"
my
mind
will
be
easy

<EOS>
exactly
as
the

strike
two
(
there

an
appointment
between
the

)
<EOS>
Mr.
Frederick
Bullock
call
,
and
he
and
Mr.
Osborne
walk
away
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
Colonel
of
the
  
th
regiment
,
in
which
Messieurs
Dobbin
and
Osborne
have
company
,
be
an
old
General
who
have
make
his
first
campaign
under
Wolfe
at
Quebec
,
and
be
long
since
quite
too
old
and
feeble
for
command
;
but
he
take
some
interest
in
the
regiment
of
which
<EOS>
he
be
the
nominal
head
,
and
make
certain
of
his
young
officer
welcome
at
his
table
,
a
kind
of
hospitality
which
I
believe
be
not
now
common
amongst
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Captain
Dobbin
be
an
especial
favourite
of
this
old
General
.
 
<EOS>
Dobbin
be
verse
in
the
literature
of
his
profession
,
and
could
talk
about
the
great
Frederick
,
and
the
Empress
Queen
,
and
their
war
,
almost
as
well
as
the
General
himself
,
who
be
indifferent
to
the
triumph
of
the
present
day
,
and
whose
heart
be
with
the
tactician
of
fifty
year
back
.
 
<EOS>
this
officer
send
a
summon
to
Dobbin
to
come
and
breakfast
with
him
,
on
the
morning
when
Mr.
Osborne
alter
his
will
and
Mr.
Chopper
put
on
his
good
shirt
frill
,
and
then
inform
his
young
favourite
,
a
couple
of
day
in
advance
,
of
that
which
they
be
all
expect
 
a
marching
order
to
go
to
Belgium
.
<EOS>
the
order
for
the
regiment
to
hold
itself
in
readiness
would
leave
the
Horse
Guards
in
a
day
or
two
;
and
as
transport
be
in
plenty
,
they
would
get
their
route
before
the
week
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
recruit
have
come
in
during
the
stay
of
the
regiment
at
Chatham
;
and
the
old
General
hope
that
the
regiment
which
have
help
to
beat
Montcalm
in
Canada
,
and
to
rout
Mr.
Washington
on
Long
Island
,
would
prove
itself
worthy
of
its
historical
reputation
on
the
oft
-
trodden
battle
-
ground
of
the
Low
Countries
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
my
good
friend
,
if
you
have
any
affaire
la
,
"
say
the
old
General
,
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
his
tremble
white
old
hand
,
and
then
point
to
the
spot
of
his
robe
de
chambre
under
which
his
heart
be
still
feebly
beat
<EOS>
,
"
if
you
have
any
Phillis
to
console
,
or
to
bid
farewell
to
papa
and
mamma
,
or
any
will
to
make
,
I
recommend
you
to
set
about
your
business
without
delay

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
which
the
General
give
his
young
friend
a
finger
to
shake
,
and
a
good
-
natured
nod
of
his
powdered
and
pigtaile
head
;
and
the
door
be
close
upon
Dobbin

sate
down
to
pen
a
poulet
(
he
be
exceedingly
vain
of
his
French
)
to
Mademoiselle
Amenaide
of
His
Majesty
's
Theatre
.
  
<EOS>
this
news
make
Dobbin
grave
,
and
he
think
of
our
friend
at
Brighton
,
and
then
he
be
ashamed
of
himself
that
Amelia
be
always
the
first
thing
in
his
thought
(
always
before
anybody
 
before
father
and
mother
,
sister
and
duty
 
always
at
wake
and
sleep
indeed
,
and
all
day
long
)
;
and
return
to
his
hotel
,
he
send
off
a
brief
note
to
Mr.
Osborne
acquaint
him
with
the
information
which
he
have
receive
,
and
which
may
tend
farther
,
he
hope
,
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
with
George

<EOS>
this
note

messenger
who
have
carry

invitation

Chopper
on
the
previous
day
,
alarm
the
worthy
clerk
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
inclose
to
him
,
and
as
he
open
the
letter
he
tremble
lest
the
dinner
should
be
put
off
on
which
he
be
calculate
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
inexpressibly
relieve
when
he
find
that
the
envelope
be
only
a
reminder
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
(
"
I

Captain
Dobbin

<EOS>
He
be

<EOS>
a
grand
dinner
be
of
more
concern
to
him
than
the
affair
of
any

mortal

<EOS>
Dobbin
be
quite
justified
in
repeat
the
General
's
information
to
any
officer
of
the

whom
he
should
see

go
up

back
up
that
young

<EOS>
the
water

be
at
work
again
,

I
be
not
sure
that
the
soft

<EOS>
the
two
ensign
,
the
Captain
,
and
Mr.
Chopper
,
dine
together
in
the
same
box
.
 
<EOS>
Chopper
bring
the
letter
from
Mr.
Osborne
,
in
which
the
latter
briefly
present
his
compliment
to
Captain
Dobbin
,
and
request
him
to
forward
the
inclose
to
Captain
George
Osborne
.
<EOS>
Chopper
know
nothing
further
;
he
describe
Mr.
Osborne
's
appearance
,
it
be
true
,
and
his
interview
with
his
lawyer
,
wonder
how
the
governor
have
swear
at
nobody
,
and
 
especially
as
the
wine
circle
round
 
abound
in
speculation
and
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
grow
more
vague
with
every
glass
,
and
at
length
become
perfectly
unintelligible
.
<EOS>
at
a
late
hour
Captain
Dobbin
put
his
guest
into
a
hackney
coach
,
in
a
hiccup
state
,
and
swear
that
he
would
be
the
kick
 
the
kick
 
Captain
's
friend
for
ever
and
ever
.
  
<EOS>
when
Captain
Dobbin
take
leave
of
Miss
Osborne
we
have
say
that
he
ask
leave
to
come
and
pay
her
another
visit
,
and
the
spinster
expect
him
for
some
hour
the
next
day
,
when
,
perhaps
,
have
he
come
,
and
have
he
ask
her
that
question
<EOS>
which
she
be
prepared
to
answer
,
she
would
have
declare
herself
as
her
brother
's
friend
,
and
a
reconciliation
may
have
be
effect
between
George
and
his
angry
father
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
she
wait
at
home
the
Captain
never
come
.
<EOS>
He
have
his
own
affair
to
pursue
;
his
own
parent
to
visit
and
console
;
and
at
an
early
hour
of
the
day
to
take
his
place
on
the
lightning
coach
,
and
go
down
to
his
friend
at
Brighton
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
day
Miss
Osborne
hear
her
father
give
order
that
that
meddle
scoundrel
,
Captain
Dobbin
,
should
never
be
admit
within
his
door
again
,
and
any
hope
in
which
she
may
have
indulge
privately
be
thus
abruptly
bring
to
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Frederick
Bullock
come
,
and
be
particularly
affectionate
to
Maria
,
and
attentive
to
the
break
-
spirited
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
for
though
he
say
his
mind
would
be
easy
,
the
mean
which
he
have
take
to
secure
quiet
do
not
seem
to
have
succeed
as
yet
,
and
the
event
of
the
past
two
day
have
visibly
shatter
him
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
all
the
principal
Personages
think
Fit
to
leave
Brighton
 
conduct
to
the
lady
,
at
the
Ship
Inn
<EOS>
,
Dobbin
assume
a
jovial
and
rattle
manner
,
which
prove
that
this
young
officer
be
become
a
more
consummate
hypocrite
every
day
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
try
to
hide
his
own
private
feeling
,
first
upon
see
Mrs.
George
Osborne
in
her
new
condition
,
and
secondly
to
mask
the
apprehension
he
entertain
as
to
the
effect
which
the
dismal
news
bring
down
by
him
would
certainly
have
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
opinion
,
George
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
the
French
Emperor
will
be
upon
us
,
horse
and
foot
,
before
three
week
be
over
,
and
will
give
the
Duke
such
a
dance
as
shall
make
the
Peninsula
appear
mere
child
's
play
.
<EOS>
but
you
need
not
say
that
to
Mrs.
Osborne
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
there
may
not
be
any
fighting
on
our
side
after
all
,
and
our
business
in
Belgium
may
turn
out
to
be
a
mere
military
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
many
person
think
so
;
and
Brussels
be
full
of
fine
people
and
lady
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
it
be
agree
to
represent
the
duty
of
the
british
army
in
Belgium
in
this
harmless
light
to
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
this
plot
be
arrange
,
the
hypocritical
Dobbin
salute
Mrs.
George
Osborne
quite
gaily
,
try
to
pay
her
one
or
two
compliment
relative
to
her
new
position
as
a
bride
(
which
compliment
,
it
must
be
confess
,
be
exceedingly
clumsy
and
hung
fire
woefully
)
,
and
then
fall
to
talk
about
Brighton
,
and
the
sea
-
air
,
and
the
gaiety
of
the
place
,
and
the
beauty
of
the
road
and
the
merit
of
the
lightning
coach
and
horse
 
all
in
a
manner
quite
incomprehensible
to
Amelia
,
and
very
amusing
to
Rebecca
,
who
be
watch
the
Captain
,
as
indeed
she
watch
every
one
near
whom
she
come
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Amelia
,
it
must
be
own
,
have
rather
a
mean
opinion
of
her
husband
's
friend
,
Captain
Dobbin
.
 
<EOS>
He
lisp
 
<EOS>
he
be
very
plain
and
homely
-
look
:
and
exceedingly
awkward
and
ungainly
.
 
<EOS>
She
like
him
for
his
attachment
to
her
husband
(
to
be
sure
there
be
very
little
merit
in
that
)
,
and
she
think
George
be
most
generous
and
kind
in
extend
his
friendship
to
his
brother
officer
.
<EOS>
George
have
mimic
Dobbin
's
lisp
and
queer
manner
many
time
to
her
,
though
to
do
him
justice
,
he
always
speak
most
highly
of
his
friend
's
good
quality
.
<EOS>
in
her
little
day
of
triumph
,
and
not
know
him
intimately
as
yet
,
she
make
light
of
honest
William
 
and
he
know
her
opinion
of
him
quite
well
,
and
acquiesce
in
them
very
humbly
.
 
<EOS>
a
time
come
when
she
know
him
better
,
and
change
her
notion
regard
him
;
but
that
be
distant
as
yet
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Rebecca
,
Captain
Dobbin
have
not
be
two
hour
in
the
lady
'
company
before
she
understand
his
secret
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
him
,
and
fear
him
privately
;
nor
be
he
very
much
prepossess
in
her
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
honest
,
that
her
art
and
cajolery
do
not
affect
him
,
and
he
shrink
from
her
with
instinctive
repulsion
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
she
be
by
no
means
so
far
superior
to
her
sex
as
to
be
above
jealousy
,
she
dislike
him
the
more
for
his
adoration
of
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
she
be
very
respectful
and
cordial
in
her
manner
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
friend
to
the
Osbornes
!
<EOS>
a
friend
to
her
dear
benefactor
!
 
<EOS>
She
vow
she
should
always
love
him
sincerely
:
she
remember
him
quite
well
on
the
Vauxhall
night
,
as
she
tell
Amelia
archly
,
and
she
make
a
little
fun
of
him
when
the
two
lady
go
to
dress
for
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Rawdon

quite
outshone
poor

who
remain
very
mute
and
timid
while
Mrs.

and
her
husband
rattle
away
together
,
and
Captain
Crawley
(
and
Jos
after
he
join
the
young
married
people

gobble
in
silence

<EOS>
Emmy
's
mind
somehow
misgave
her
about

Rebecca

wit

spirit

a
rueful
disquiet

They

ennui

eager
for

<EOS>
She
tremble
for
the
future

<EOS>
how
shall
I
be
a
companion
for
him
,
she
think
 
so
clever
and
so
brilliant
,
and
I
such
a
humble
foolish
creature
?
<EOS>
how
noble
it
be
of
him
to
marry
me
 
to
give
up
everything
and
stoop
down
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
refuse
him
,
only
I
have
not
the
heart

<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
stop
at
home
and
take
care
of
poor
Papa

<EOS>
and
her
neglect
of
her
parent
<EOS>
(
and
indeed
there
be
some
foundation
for
this
charge

the
poor
child

uneasy
conscience
bring
against

be
now
remember
for
the
first
time

cause
her
to
blush
with
humiliation

<EOS>
oh
!
think
she
,
I
have
be
very
wicked
and
selfish
 
selfish
in
forget
them
in
their
sorrow
 
selfish
in
force
George
to
marry
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
not
worthy
of
him
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
have
be
happy
without
me
 
<EOS>
and
yet
 
I
try
<EOS>
,
I
try
to
give
him
up
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
hard
when
,
before
seven
day
of
marriage
be
over
,
such
thought
and
confession
as
these
force
themselves
on
a
little
bride

mind

<EOS>
but
so
it
be
,
and
the
night
before
Dobbin
come
to
join
these
young
people
 
on
a
fine
brilliant
moonlight
night
of
May
 
so
warm
and
balmy
that
the
window
be
fling
open
to
the
balcony
,
from
which
George
and
Mrs.
Crawley
be
gaze
upon
the
calm
ocean
<EOS>
spread
shine
before
them
,
while
Rawdon
and
Jos
be
engage
at
backgammon
within
 
Amelia
couch
in
a
great
chair
quite
neglect
,
and
watch
both
these
party
,
feel
a
despair
and
remorse
such
as
be
bitter
companion
for
that
tender
lonely
soul
.
 
<EOS>
Scarce
a
week
be
past
,
and
it
be
come
to
this
!
<EOS>
the
future
,
have
she
regard
it
,
offer
a
dismal
prospect
;
but
Emmy
be
too
shy
,
so
to
speak
,
to
look
to
that
,
and
embark
alone
on
that
wide
sea
,
and
unfit
to
navigate
it
without
a
guide
and
protector
.
<EOS>
I
know
Miss
Smith
have
a
mean
opinion
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
many
,
my
dear
Madam
,
be
endow
with
your
prodigious
strength
of
mind
?
  
<EOS>
"
Gad
,
what
a
fine
night
,
and
how
bright
the
moon
be
!
"
<EOS>
George
say
,
with
a
puff
of
his
cigar
,
which
go
soar
up
skyward
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
delicious
they
smell
in
the
open
air
!
 
<EOS>
I
adore
them
.
 
<EOS>
who
'd
think
the
moon
be
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
six
thousand
eight
hundred
and
forty
-
seven
mile
off
?
"
<EOS>
Becky
add
,
gaze
at
that
orb
with
a
smile
.
"
<EOS>
be
not
it
clever
of
me
to
remember
that
?
 
<EOS>
Pooh
!
 
<EOS>
we
learn
it
all
at
Miss
Pinkerton
's
!
 
<EOS>
how
calm
the
sea
be
,
and
how
clear
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
can
almost
see
the
coast
of
France
!
"
<EOS>
and
her
bright
green
eye
stream
out
,
and
shoot
into
the
night
as
if
they
could
see
through
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
what
I
intend
to
do
one
morning
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
;
"
I
find
I
can
swim
beautifully
,
and
some
day
,
when
my
Aunt
Crawley

companion
 
old
Briggs
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
you
remember
her
 
that
hook
-
nosed
woman
,
with
the
long
wisps
of
hair
 
when
Briggs
go
out
to
bathe
,
I
intend
to
dive
under
her
awning
,
and
insist
on
a
reconciliation
in
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
that
a
stratagem
?
"
  
<EOS>
George
burst
out
laugh
at
the
idea
of
this
aquatic
meeting
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
row
there
,
you
two
?
"
<EOS>
Rawdon
shout
out
,
rattle
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
be
make
a
fool
of
herself
in
an
absurd
hysterical
manner
,
and
retire
to
her
own
room
to
whimper
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
Our
history
be
destine
in
this
chapter
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
very
irresolute
manner
seemingly
,
and
have
conduct
our
story
to
to
-
morrow
presently
,
we
shall
immediately
again
have
occasion
to
step
back
to
yesterday
,
so
that
the
whole
of
the
tale
may
get
a
hearing
.
<EOS>
as
you
behold
at
her
Majesty
's
drawing
-
room
,
the
ambassador
'
and
high
dignitary
'
carriage
whisk
off
from
a
private
door
,
while
Captain
Jones
's
lady
be
wait
for
their
fly
:
as
you
see
in
the
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
's
antechamber
,
a
half
-
dozen
of
petitioner
wait
patiently
for
their
audience
,
and
call
out
one
by
one
,
when
suddenly
an
irish
member
or
some
eminent
personage
enter
the
apartment
,
and
instantly
walk
into
Mr.
Under
-
Secretary
over
the
head
of
all
the
people
present
:
so
in
the
conduct
of
a
tale
,
the
romancer
be
oblige
to
exercise
this
most
partial
sort
of
justice
.
 
<EOS>
although
all
the
little
incident
must
be
hear
,
yet
they
must
be
put
off
when
the
great
event
make
their
appearance
;
and
surely
such
a
circumstance
as
that
which
bring
Dobbin
to
Brighton
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
the
ordering
out
of
the
Guards
and
the
line
to
Belgium
,
and
the
mustering
of
the
ally
army
in
that
country
under
the
command
of
his
Grace
the
Duke
of
Wellington
 
such
a
dignified
circumstance
as
that
,
I
say
,
be
entitle
to
the
pas
over
all
minor
occurrence
<EOS>
whereof
this
history
be
compose
mainly
,
and
hence
a
little
trifling
disarrangement
and
disorder
be
excusable
and
become
.
<EOS>
We
have
only
now
advance
in
time
so
far
beyond
chapter
XXII
as
to
have
get
our
various
character
up
into
their
dressing
-
room
before
the
dinner
,
which
take
place
as
usual
on
the
day
of
Dobbin
's
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
George
be
too
humane
or
too
much
occupy
with
the
tie
of
his
neckcloth
to
convey
at
once
all
the
news
to
Amelia
which
his
comrade
have
bring
with
him
from
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
into
her
room
,
however
,
hold
the
attorney
's
letter
in
his
hand
,
and
with
so
solemn
and
important
an
air
that
his
wife
,
always
ingeniously
on
the
watch
for
calamity
,
think
the
bad
be
about
to
befall
,
and
run
up
to
her
husband
,
besought
her
dear
George
to
tell
her
everything
 
he
be
order
abroad
;
there
would
be
a
battle
next
week
 
<EOS>
she
know
there
would
.
  
<EOS>
Dearest
George
parry
the
question
about
foreign
service
,
and
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
say
,
"
no
,
Emmy
;
it
be
not
that
:
 
it
be
not
myself
<EOS>
I
care
about
:
it

you

<EOS>
I
have
have
bad
news
from
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
refuse
any
communication
with
me
;
he
have
fling
us
off
;
and
leave
us
to
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
rough
it
well
enough
;
but
you
,
my
dear
,
how
will
you
bear
it
?
<EOS>
read
here
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
hand
her
over
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
,
with
a
look
of
tender
alarm
in
her
eye
,
listen
to
her
noble
hero
as
he
utter
the
above
generous
sentiment
,
and
sit
down
on
the
bed
,
read
the
letter
which
George
give
her
with
such
a
pompous
martyr
-
like
air
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
clear
up
as
she
read
the
document
,
however
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
share
poverty
and
privation
in
company
with
the
beloved
object
be
,
as
we
have
before
say
,
far
from
be
disagreeable
to
a
warm
-
hearted
woman
.
<EOS>
the
notion
be
actually
pleasant
to
little
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
usual
,
she
be
ashamed
of
herself
for
feel
happy
at
such
an
indecorous
moment
,
and
check
her
pleasure
,
say
demurely
,
"
o
,
George
,
how
your
poor
heart
must
bleed
at
the
idea
of
be
separate
from
your
papa
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
,
"
say
George
,
with
an
agonise
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
can
not
be
angry
with
you
long
,
"
she
continue
.
<EOS>
"
nobody
could
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
forgive
you
,
my

kind
husband

<EOS>
o

I
shall
never
forgive
myself
if
he

<EOS>
"
what
vex
me

my
poor
Emmy

be
not
my
misfortune

yours

"
George
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
for
a
little
poverty
;
and
I
think
,
without
vanity

I
have
talent
enough
to
make
my
own
way

that
you
have

interpose
his

yes

I
shall
make
my
way
as
well
as
another

on
;

you
,
my
dear
girl

how
can
I
bear
your
be
deprive
of
the
comfort
and
station
in
society
which
my

a
right
to

My

in
barrack

the
wife

soldier
in
a
marching
regiment

subject

all
sort
of
annoyance

privation

<EOS>
It
make
me
miserable

<EOS>
Emmy
,
quite
at
ease
,
as
this
be
her
husband
's
only
cause
of
disquiet
,
take
his
hand
,
and
with
a
radiant
face
and
smile
begin
to
warble
that
stanza
from
the
favourite
song
of
"
Wapping
Old
Stairs
,
"
in
which
the
heroine
,
after
rebuke
her
Tom
for
inattention
,
promise
"
his
trouser
to
mend
,
and
his
grog
too
to
make

"
if
he
will
be
constant
and
kind
,
and
not
forsake
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
besides
,
"
she
say
,
after
a
pause
,
during
which
she
look
as
pretty
and
happy
as
any
young

"
be
not
two
thousand
pound
an
immense
deal

money

<EOS>
George
laugh
at
her
naivete
;
and
finally
they
go
down
to
dinner
<EOS>
,
Amelia
cling
to
George
's
arm
,
still
warble
the
tune
of
"
Wapping
Old

and
more
pleased
and
light
of
mind
than
she
have
be

some
day
past

thus
the
repast

dismal

merry

Amelia

ask

what

<EOS>
thus
somehow
the
bitterness

<EOS>
though
war

war

<EOS>
there
be
a
respite

which
make
the
timid
little
Amelia
almost
as
happy
as
a

reprieve
would
have
do

which
even
Dobbin
own
in

<EOS>

<EOS>
for

to
be
permit
to
see
her
be
now
the
great
privilege

hope
of

he
think
with
himself
secretly
how

protect
her

<EOS>
I
would
not

<EOS>
but
George

the
master

his

fit
to

<EOS>
put

Rebecca

<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
evening
Rawdon
get
a
little

note
from
his

,
which
,
although
he
crumple
it
up

burn
it
instantly
in

we

<EOS>
so
when
the

about
adjourn
to
coffee
in
the

apartment
,
Rawdon
touch
Osborne
on
the
elbow

gracefully
,
"

It
be
not

convenient

but
nevertheless
George
give
him
a
considerable
present
instalment
in
bank
-
note
from
his
pocket

book
,
and
a
bill
on

this

Jos

Dobbin

hold
a
council

over

general
move
should
be
make
for
London
in
Jos
's
open
carriage
the
next
day

<EOS>
Jos
,
I
think
,
would
have
prefer
stay
until
Rawdon
Crawley
quit
Brighton
,
but
Dobbin
and
George
overrule
him
,
and
he
agree
to
carry
the
party
to
town
,
and
order
four
horse
,
as
become
his
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
they
set
off
in
state
,
after
breakfast
,
the
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
have
rise
very
early
in
the
morning
,
and
pack
her
little
trunk
with
the
great
alacrity
,
while
Osborne
lie
in
bed
deplore
that
she
have
not
a
maid
to
help
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
only
too
glad
,
however
,
to
perform
this
office
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
a
dim
uneasy
sentiment
about
Rebecca
fill
her
mind
already
;
and
although
they
kiss
each
other
most
tenderly
at
parting
,
yet
we
know
what
jealousy
be
;
and
Mrs.
Amelia
possess
that
among
other
virtue
of
her
sex
.
  
<EOS>
besides
these
character
who
be
come
and
go
away
,
we
must
remember
that
there
be
some
other
old
friend
of
our
at
Brighton
;
Miss
Crawley
,
namely
,
and
the
suite
in
attendance
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
although
Rebecca
and
her
husband
be
but
at
a
few
stone

of
the
lodging

the
invalid
Miss

,
the
old
lady

as
pitilessly
closed
to
them
as
it
have
be
heretofore
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
as
long
as
she
remain
by
the
side
of
her
sister

in

,
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
take
care
that
her
beloved
Matilda
should
not
be
agitate
by
a
meeting
with
her
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
spinster
take
her
drive
,
the
faithful
Mrs.
Bute
sate
beside
her
in
the

.
<EOS>
when
Miss
Crawley
take
the
air
in
a
chair
,
Mrs.
Bute
march
on
one
side
of
the
vehicle
,
whilst
honest
Briggs
occupy
the
other
wing
.
<EOS>
and
if
they
meet
Rawdon
and
his
wife
by
chance
 
<EOS>
although
the
former
constantly
and
obsequiously
take
off
his
hat
,
the
Miss

Crawley
party
pass
him
by
with
such
a
frigid
and
kill
indifference

Rawdon
begin
to
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
as
well

Captain
Rawdon
often
say
,
with
a
downcast
air

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
when

say
dauntless
little
Becky

and
further
point
out
to
her

the
great
comfort
and
advantage
of
meeting
Jos

Osborne

whose
acquaintance
have

to
Rawdon
Crawley
a
most
timely
little
supply

ready
money

<EOS>
"
It

grumble
the
Guardsman

<EOS>
"
why
need

say
the

who
have
an
answer
for
everything

<EOS>
through
Rawdon

pretty
well
know

our
young

Rebecca
luckily
bethink
herself
of
be
unwell
,
and
of
call
in
the
same
apothecary
who
be
in
attendance
upon
the
spinster

She

<EOS>
now

Rebecca
disappear
also

and
she
remember
the

<EOS>
and

indeed

she
and
Mrs.

the
lady's

and
the
whole
of
Miss

household

under
the
tyranny
of
the
triumphant
Mrs.

<EOS>
as
often
will
be
the
case
,
that
good

imperious
woman
push
her
advantage
too
far

quite
unmercifully

She
have
<EOS>
in

bring
the

such
a

Mrs.

with

She

in

Fever

there

such
a
jubilee

sense

<EOS>
as
the
company

<EOS>
that
very

Miss

afternoon
dose
of
medicine
:
 
that
afternoon
Bowls

an
independent
bottle
of
sherry
for
himself
and
Mrs.
Firkin
:
 
that
night
Miss
Crawley
and
Miss
Briggs
indulge
in
a
game
of
piquet
instead
of
one
of
Porteus
's
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
in
the
old
nursery

story
,
when
the
stick
forget
to
beat
the
dog
,
and
the
whole
course

<EOS>
at
a
very
early
hour
in

twice

thrice
a

,
Miss

betake
herself
to
a
bathing

,
and
disport
in
the
water
in
a
flannel

an
oilskin

<EOS>
Rebecca
,
as
we
have

be
aware
of
this
circumstance
,
and
though
she
do
not
attempt
to
storm
Briggs
as
she
have
threaten
,
and
actually
dive
into
that
lady

presence
and
surprise

Mrs.
Rawdon
determine
to
attack
Briggs
as
she
come
away
from
her
bath
,
refresh
and
invigorate
by
her
dip
,
and
likely
to
be
in
good

<EOS>
so
get
up
very
early
the
next

Becky

the
telescope
in
their
sitting

room

which
face
the

see
Briggs

enter
her
box

and
put

<EOS>
It

what

Briggs
do

"

<EOS>
Mrs.

<EOS>
"

such
natural

that
Miss

sudden

happy
retreat

and

<EOS>
all
Miss

and
the
particular
of
her
illness
and
medical
treatment
,
be
narrate
by
the
confidante
with
that
fulness
and
accuracy
which
woman
delight
in
.
 
<EOS>
about
their
complaint
and
their
doctor
do
lady
ever
tire
of
talk
to
each
other
?
 
<EOS>
Briggs
do
not
on
this
occasion
;
nor
do
Rebecca
weary
of
listen
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
thankful
,
truly
thankful
,
<EOS>
that
the
dear
kind
Briggs
,
that
the
faithful
,
the
invaluable
Firkin
,
have
be
permit
to
remain
with
their
benefactress
through
her
illness
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
bless
her
!
<EOS>
though
she
,
Rebecca
,
have
seem
to
act
undutifully
towards
Miss
Crawley
;
yet
be
not
her
fault
a
natural
and
excusable
one
?
<EOS>
Could
she
help
give
her
hand
to
the
man
who
have
win
her
heart
?
 
<EOS>
Briggs
,
the
sentimental
,
could
only
turn
up
her
eye
to
heaven
at
this
appeal
,
and
heave
a
sympathetic
sigh
,
and
think
that
she
,
too
,
have
give
away
her
affection
long
year
ago
,
and
own
that
Rebecca
be
no
very
great
criminal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
ever
forget
her
who
so
befriend
the
friendless
orphan
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
though
she
have
cast
me
off
,
"
the
latter
say
,
"
I
shall
never
cease
to
love
her
,
and
I
would
devote
my
life
to
her
service
.
 
<EOS>
as
my
own
benefactress
,
as
my
beloved
Rawdon
's
adored
relative
,
I
love
and
admire
Miss
Crawley
,
dear
Miss
Briggs
,
beyond
any
woman
in
the
world
,
and
next
to
her
I
love
all
those
who
be
faithful
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
never
have
treat
Miss
Crawley
's
faithful
friend
as
that
odious
designing
Mrs.
Bute
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
Rawdon
,
who
be
all
heart
,
"
Rebecca
continue
,
"
although
his
outward
manner
may
seem
rough
and
careless
,
have
say
a
hundred
time
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
that
he
bless
Heaven
for
send
his
dear
<EOS>
Aunty
two
such
admirable
nurse
as
her
attach
Firkin
and
her
admirable
Miss
Briggs
.
 
<EOS>
Should
the
machination
of
the
horrible
Mrs.
Bute
end
,
as
she
too
much
fear
they
would
,
in
banish
everybody
that
Miss
Crawley
love
from
her
side
,
and
leave
that
poor
lady
a
victim
to
those
harpy
at
the
Rectory
,
Rebecca
beseech
her
(
Miss
Briggs
)
to
remember
that
her
own
home
,
humble
as
it
be
,
be
always
open
to
receive
Briggs
.
<EOS>
dear
friend
,
"
she
exclaim
,
in
a
transport
of
enthusiasm
,
"
some
heart
can
never
forget
benefit
;
all
woman
be
not
Bute
Crawleys
!
<EOS>
though
why
should
I
complain
of
her
,
"
Rebecca
add
;
"
though
I
have
be
her
tool
and
the
victim
to
her
art
,
do
I
not
owe
my
dear
Rawdon
to
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
Rebecca
unfold
to
Briggs
all
Mrs.
Bute
's
conduct
at
Queen
's
Crawley
,
<EOS>
which
,
though
unintelligible
to
her
then
,
be
clearly
enough
explain
by
the
event
now
 
now
that
the
attachment
have
spring
up
which
Mrs.
Bute
have
encourage
by
a
thousand
artifice
 
now
that
two
innocent
people
have
fall
into
the
snare
which
she
have
lay
for
them
,
and
love
and
marry
and
be
ruin
through
her
scheme
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
true
.
 
<EOS>
Briggs
see
the
stratagem
as
clearly
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
have
make
the
match
between
Rawdon
and
Rebecca
.
<EOS>
yet
,
though
the
latter
be
a
perfectly
innocent
victim
,
Miss
Briggs
could
not
disguise
from
her
friend
her
fear
that
Miss
Crawley
's
affection
be
hopelessly
estranged
from
Rebecca
,
and
that
the
old
lady
would
never
forgive
her
nephew
for
make
so
imprudent
a
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
point
Rebecca
have
her
own
opinion
,
and
still
keep
up
a
good
heart
.
 
<EOS>
if
Miss
Crawley
do
not
forgive
them
at
present
,
she
may
at
least
relent
on
a
future
day
.
 
<EOS>
even
now
,
there
be
only
that
puling
,
<EOS>
sickly
Pitt
Crawley
between
Rawdon
and
a
baronetcy
;
and
should
anything
happen
to
the
former
,
all
would
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
to
have
Mrs.
Bute
's
design
expose
,
and
herself
well
abused
,
be
a
satisfaction
,
and
may
be
advantageous
to
Rawdon
's
interest
;
and
Rebecca
,
after
an
hour
's
chat
with
her
recovered
friend
,
leave
her
with
the
most
tender
demonstration
of
regard
,
and
quite
assure
that
the
conversation
they
have
have
together
would
be
report
to
Miss
Crawley
before
many
hour
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
this
interview
end
,
it
become
full
time
for
Rebecca
to
return
to
her
inn
,
where
all
the
party
of
the
previous
day
be
assemble
at
a
farewell
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
take
such
a
tender
leave
of
Amelia
as
become
two
woman
who
love
each
other
as
sister
;
and
have
use
her
handkerchief
plentifully
,
and
hang
on
her
friend
's
neck
as
if
they
be
part
for
ever
,
and
wave
the
handkerchief
(
which
be
quite
dry
,
by
the
way
)
out
of
window
,
as
the
carriage
drive
off
,
she
come
back
to
the
breakfast
table
,
and
eat
some
prawn
with
a
good
deal
of
appetite
,
consider
her
emotion
;
and
while
she
be
munch
these
delicacy
,
explain
to
Rawdon
what
have
occur
in
her
morning
walk
between
herself
and
Briggs
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hope
be
very
high
:
 
<EOS>
she
make
her
husband
share
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
generally
succeed
in
make
her
husband
share
all
her
opinion
,
whether
melancholy
or
cheerful
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
now
,
if
you
please
,
my
dear
,
sit
down
at
the
writing
-
table
and
pen
me
a
pretty
little
letter
to
Miss
Crawley
,
in
which
you
will
say
that
you
be
a
good
boy
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
Rawdon
sate
down
,
and
write
off
,
"
Brighton
,
Thursday
,
"
and
"
My
dear
Aunt
,
"
with
great
rapidity
:
<EOS>
but
there
the
gallant
officer
's
imagination
fail
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
mumble
the
end
of
his
pen
,
and
look
up
in
his
wife
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
laugh
at
his
rueful
countenance
,
and
march
up
and
down
the
room
with
her
hand
behind
her
,
the
little
woman
begin
to
dictate
a
letter
,
which
he
take
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
quit
the
country
and
commence
a
campaign
,
which
very
possibly
may
be
fatal
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
say
Rawdon
,
rather
surprised
,
but
take
the
humour
of
the
phrase
,
and
presently
write
it
down
with
a
grin
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
very
possibly
may
be
fatal
,
I
have
come
hither
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
why
not
say
come
here
,
Becky
?
 
<EOS>
come
here
be

,
"
the
dragoon
interpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
hither
,
"
Rebecca
insist
,
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
,
"
to
say
farewell
to
my
dear
and
early
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
before
I
go
,
not
perhaps
to
return
,
once
more
to
let
me
press
the
hand
from
which
I
have
receive
nothing
but
kindnesse
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
kindnesse
all
my
life
,
"
echo
Rawdon
,
scratch
down
the
word
,
and
quite
amazed
at
his
own
facility
of
composition
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
nothing
from
you
but
that
we
should
part
not
in
anger
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
pride
of
my
family
on
some
point
,
though
not
on
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
marry
a
painter
's
daughter
,
and
be
not
ashamed
of
the
union
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
run
me
through
the
body
if
I
be

"
<EOS>
rawdon
ejaculate
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
old
booby
,
"
Rebecca
say
,
pinch
his
ear
and
look
over
to
see
that
he
make
no
mistake
in
spelling
 
<EOS>
"
beseech
be
not
spelt
with
an
a

and
early
be

"
 
<EOS>
so
he
alter
these
word
,
bow
to
the
superior
knowledge
of
his
little
missis
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
you
be
aware
of
the
progress
of
my
attachment
,
"
Rebecca
continue
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
confirm
and
encourage
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
make
no
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
I
marry
a
poor
woman
,
and
be
content
to
abide
by
what
I
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
leave
your
property
,
dear
Aunt
,
as
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
complain
of
the
way
in
which
you
dispose
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
believe
that
I
love
you
for
yourself
,
and
not
for
money
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
reconcile
to
you
ere
<EOS>
I
leave
England
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
,
let
me
see
you
before
I
go
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
week
or
month
hence
it
may
be
too
late
,
and
I
can
not
bear
the
notion
of
quit
the
country
without
a
kind
word
of
farewell
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
recognise
my
style
in
that
,
"
say
Becky
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
make
the
sentence
short
and
brisk
on
purpose
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
authentic
missive
be
despatch
under
cover
to
Miss
Briggs
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Miss
Crawley
laugh
when
Briggs
,
with
great
mystery
,
hand
her
over
this
candid
and
simple
statement
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
may
read
it
now
Mrs.
Bute
be
away
,
"
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
read
it
to
me
,
Briggs
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
Briggs
have
read
the
epistle
out
,
her
patroness
laugh
more
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
see
,
you
goose
,
<EOS>
"
she
say
to
Briggs
,
who
profess
to
be
much
touch
by
the
honest
affection
which
pervade
the
composition
,
"
do
not
you
see
that
Rawdon
never
write
a
word
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
write
to
me
without
ask
for
money
in
his
life
,
and
all
his
letter
be
full
of
bad
spelling
,
and
dash
,
and
bad
grammar
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
that
little
serpent
of
a
governess
who
rule
him
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
all
alike
,
Miss
Crawley
think
in
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
want
me
dead
,
and
be
hanker
for
my
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mind
see
Rawdon
,
"
she
add
,
after
a
pause
,
and
in
a
tone
of
perfect
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
as
soon
shake
hand
with
him
as
not
.
 
<EOS>
provide
there
be
no
scene
<EOS>
,
why
should
not
we
meet
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
.
<EOS>
but
human
patience
have
its
limit
;
and
mind
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
respectfully
decline
to
receive
Mrs.
Rawdon
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
support
that
quite
"
 
and
Miss
Briggs
be
fain
to
be
content
with
this
half
-
message
of
conciliation
;
and
think
that
the
good
method
of
bring
the
old
lady
and
her
nephew
together
,
be
to
warn
Rawdon
to
be
in
wait
on
the
Cliff
,
when
Miss
Crawley
go
out
for
her
air
in
her
chair
.
 
<EOS>
there
they
meet
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
Miss
Crawley
have
any
private
feeling
of
regard
or
emotion
upon
see
her
old
favourite
;
but
she
hold
out
a
couple
of
finger
to
him
with
as
smile
and
good
-
humour
an
air
,
as
if
they
have
meet
only
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
for
Rawdon
,
he
turn
as
red
as
scarlet
,
and
wring
off
Briggs
's
hand
,
so
great
be
his
rapture
and
his
confusion
at
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
interest
that
move
him
:
 
or
perhaps
affection
:
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
touch
by
the
change
which
the
illness
of
the
last
week
have
work
in
his
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
old
girl
have
always
act
like
a
trump
to
me
,
"
he
say
to
his
wife
,
as
he
narrate
the
interview
,
"
and
I
feel
,
you
know
,
rather
queer
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
by
the
side
of
the
what
-
dy'e
-
call
 
'em
,
you
know
,
and
to
her
own
door
,
where
Bowls
come
to
help
her
in
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
want
to
go
in
very
much
,
<EOS>
only
 
"
  
"
you
didn't
go
<EOS>
in
,
Rawdon
!
"
scream
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
;
I
be
hang
if
I
be
not
afraid
when
it
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
fool
!
<EOS>
you
ought
to
have
go
in
,
and
never
come
out
again
,
"
Rebecca
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
call
me
name
,
"
say
the
big
Guardsman
,
sulkily
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
be
a
fool
,
Becky
,
but
you
should
not
say
so
"
;
and
he
give
his
wife
a
look
,
such
as
his
countenance
could
wear
when
anger
,
and
such
as
be
not
pleasant
to
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
dear
,
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
you
must
be
on
the
look
-
out
,
and
go
and
see
her
,
mind
,
whether
she
ask
you
or
no
,
"
Rebecca
say
,
try
to
soothe
her
angry
yoke
-
mate
.
 
<EOS>
on
which
he
reply
,
that
he
would
do
exactly
as
he
like
,
and
would
just
thank
her
to
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
her
head
 
and
the
wounded
husband
go
away
,
and
pass
the
forenoon
at
the
billiard
-
room
,
sulky
,
silent
,
and
suspicious
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
the
night
be
over
he
be
compel
to
give
in
,
and
own
,
as
usual
,
to
his
wife
's
superior
prudence
and
foresight
,
by
the
most
melancholy
confirmation
of
the
presentiment
which
she
have
regard
the
consequence
of
the
mistake
which
he
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
must
have
have
some
emotion
upon
see
him
and
shake
hand
with
him
after
so
long
a
rupture
.
 
<EOS>
She
muse
upon
the
meeting
a
considerable
time
.
<EOS>
"
Rawdon
be
get
very
fat
and
old
,
Briggs
,
"
she
say
to
her
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
nose
have
become
red
,
and
he
be
exceedingly
coarse
in
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
His
marriage
to
that
woman

but
to
link
each
other
's
arm
together
,
and
wander
gently
downwards
towards
old
age
in
happy
and
perfect
fruition
.
 
<EOS>
but
our
little
Amelia
be
just
on
the
bank
of
her
new
country
,
and
be
already
look
anxiously
back
towards
the
sad
friendly
figure
wave
farewell
to
her
across
the
stream
,
from
the
other
distant
shore
.
  
<EOS>
in
honour
of
the
young
bride
's
arrival
,
her
mother
think
it
necessary
to
prepare
I
do
not
know
what
festive
entertainment
,
and
after
the
first
ebullition
of
talk
,
take
leave
of
Mrs.
George
Osborne
for
a
while
,
and
dive
down
to
the
low
region
of
the
house
to
a
sort
of
kitchen
-
parlour
(
occupy
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Clapp
,
and
in
the
evening
,
when
her
dish
be
wash
and
her
curl
-
paper
remove
,
by
Miss
Flannigan
,
the
irish
servant
)
,
there
to
take
measure
for
the
preparing
of
a
magnificent
ornamented
tea
.
 
<EOS>
all
people
have
their
way
of
express
kindness
,
and
it
seem
to
Mrs.
Sedley
that
a
muffin
and
a
quantity
of
orange
marmalade
spread
out
in
a
little
cut
-
glass
saucer
would
be
peculiarly
agreeable
refreshment
to
Amelia
in
her
most
interesting
situation
.
  
<EOS>
while
these
delicacy
be
be
transact
below
,
Amelia
,
leave
the
drawing
-
room
,
walk
upstairs
and
find
herself
,
she
scarce
know
how
,
in
the
little
room
which
she
have
occupy
before
her
marriage
,
and
in
that
very
chair
in
which
she
have
pass
so
many
bitter
hour
.
<EOS>
She
sink
back
in
its
arm
as
if
it
be
an
old
friend
;
and
fall
to
think
over
the
past
week
,
and
the
life
beyond
it
.
 
<EOS>
already
to
be
look
sadly
and
vaguely
back
:
always
to
be
pine
for
something
which
,
when
obtain
,
bring
doubt
and
sadness
rather
than
pleasure
;
here
be
the
lot
of
our
poor
little
creature
and
harmless
lose
wanderer
in
the
great
struggle
crowd
of
Vanity
Fair
.
  
<EOS>
here
she
sate
,
and
recall
to
herself
fondly
that
image
of
George
to
which
she
have
knelt
before
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
do
she
own
to
herself
how
different
the
real
man
be
from
that
superb
young
hero
whom
she
have
worship
?
 
<EOS>
It
require
many
,
many
year
 
and
<EOS>
a
man
must
be
very
bad
indeed
 
before
a
woman
's
pride
and
vanity
will
let
her
own
to
such
a
confession
.
 
<EOS>
then
Rebecca
's
twinkle
green
eye
and
baleful
smile
light
upon
her
,
and
fill
her
with
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
sate
for
awhile
indulge
in
her
usual
mood
of
selfish
brooding
,
in
that
very
listless
melancholy
attitude
in
which
the
honest
maid
-
servant
have
find
her
,
on
the
day
when
she
bring
up
the
letter
in
which
George
renew
his
offer
of
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
the
little
white
bed
,
which
have
be
her
a
few
day
before
,
and
think
she
would
like
to
sleep
in
it
that
night
,
and
wake
,
as
formerly
,
with
her
mother
smile
over
her
in
the
morning
:
then
she
think
with
terror
of
the
great
funereal
damask
pavilion
in
the
vast
and
dingy
state
bedroom
,
which
be
await
her
at
the
grand
hotel
in
Cavendish
Square
.
 
<EOS>
dear
little
white
bed
!
<EOS>
how
many
a
long
night
have
she
weep
on
its
pillow
!
<EOS>
how
she
have
despair
and
hope
to
die
there
;
and
now
be
not
all
her
wish
accomplish
,
and
the
lover
of
whom
she
have
despair
her
own
for
ever
?
 
<EOS>
kind
mother
!
<EOS>
how
patiently
and
tenderly
she
have
watch
round
that
bed
!
<EOS>
She
go
and
kneel
down
by
the
bedside
;
and
there
this
wounded
and
timorous
,
but
gentle
and
loving
soul
,
seek
for
consolation
,
where
as
yet
,
it
must
be
own
,
our
little
girl
have
but
seldom
look
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Love
have
be
her
faith
hitherto
;
and
the
sad
,
bleed
disappointed
heart
begin
to
feel
the
want
of
another
consoler
.
  
<EOS>
have
we
a
right
to
repeat
or
to
overhear
her
prayer
?
<EOS>
these
,
brother
,
be
secret
,
and
out
of
the
domain
of
Vanity
Fair
,
in
which
our
story
lie
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
may
be
say
,
that
when
the
tea
be
finally
announce
,
our
young
lady
come
downstairs
a
great
deal
more
cheerful
;
that
she
do
not
despond
,
or
deplore
her
fate
,
or
think
about
George
's
coldness
,
or
Rebecca
's
eye
,
as
she
have
be
will
not
to
do
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
downstairs
,
and
kiss
her
father
and
mother
,
and
talk
to
the
old
gentleman
,
and
make
him
more
merry
than
he
have
be
for
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
She
sate
down
at
the
piano
which
Dobbin
have
buy
for
her
,
and
sing
over
all
her
father
's
favourite
old
song
.
 
<EOS>
She
pronounce
the
tea
to
be
excellent
,
and
praise
the
exquisite
taste
in
which
the
marmalade
be
arrange
in
the
saucer
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
determine
to
make
everybody
else
happy
,
she
find
herself
so
;
and
be
sound
asleep
in
the
great
funereal
pavilion
,
and
only
wake
up
with
a
smile
when
George
arrive
from
the
theatre
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
next
day
,
George
have
more
important
"
business
"
to
transact
than
that
which
take
him
to
see
Mr.
Kean
in
Shylock
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
London
he
have
write
off
to
his
father
's
solicitor
,
signify
his
royal
pleasure
that
an
interview
should
take
place
between
them
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
His
hotel
bill
,
loss
at
billiard
and
card
to
Captain
Crawley
have
almost
drain
the
young
man
's
purse
,
which
want
replenish
before
he
set
out
on
his
travel
,
and
he
have
no
resource
but
to
infringe
upon
the
two
thousand
pound
which
the
attorney
be
commission
to
pay
over
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
perfect
belief
in
his
own
mind
that
his
father
would
relent
before
very
long
.
<EOS>
how
could
any
parent
be
obdurate
for
a
length
of
time
against
such
a
paragon
as
he
be
?
 
<EOS>
if
his
mere
past
and
personal
merit
do
not
succeed
in
mollify
his
father
,
George
determine
that
he
would
distinguish
himself
so
prodigiously
in
the
ensue
campaign
that
the
old
gentleman
must
give
in
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
not
?
<EOS>
bah
!
<EOS>
the
world
be
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
luck
may
change
at
card
,
and
there
be
a
deal
of
spending
in
two
thousand
pound
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
send
off
Amelia
once
more
in
a
carriage
to
her
mamma
,
with
strict
order
and
carte
blanche
to
the
two

purchase
everything
requisite
for
a
lady
of
Mrs.
George
Osborne
's
fashion
,
who
be
go
on
a
foreign
tour
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
<EOS>
but
one
day
to
complete
the
outfit
,
and
it
may
be
imagine
that
their
business
therefore
occupy
them
pretty
fully
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
carriage
once
more
,
bustle
about
from
milliner
to
linen
-
draper
,
escort
back
to
the
carriage
by
obsequious
shopman
or
polite
owner
,
Mrs.
Sedley
be
herself
again
almost
,
and
sincerely
happy
for
the
first
time
since
their
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
Mrs.
Amelia
at
all
above
the
pleasure
of
shopping
,
and
bargaining
,
and
see
and
buy
pretty
thing
.
<EOS>
(
Would
any
man
,
the
most
philosophic
,
give
twopence
for
a
woman
who
be
?
)
 
<EOS>
She
give
herself
a
little
treat
,
obedient
to
her
husband
's
order
,
and
purchase
a
quantity
of
lady
's
gear
,
show
a
great
deal
of
taste
and
elegant
discernment
,
as
all
the
shopfolk
say
.
  
<EOS>
and
about
the
war
that
be
ensue
,
Mrs.
Osborne
be
not
much
alarm
;
Bonaparty
be
to
be
crush
almost
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
margate
packet
be
sail
every
day
,
fill
with
man
of
fashion
and
lady
of
note
,
on
their
way
to
Brussels
and
Ghent
.
 
<EOS>
People
be
go
not
so
much
to
a
war
as
to
a
fashionable
tour
.
 
<EOS>
the
newspaper
laugh
the
wretched
upstart
and
swindler
to
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
corsican
wretch
as
that
withstand
the
army
of
Europe
and
the
genius
of
the
immortal
Wellington
!
 
<EOS>
Amelia
hold
him
in
utter
contempt
;
for
it
need
not
to
be
say
that
this
soft
and
gentle
creature
take
her
opinion
from
those
people
who
surround
her
,
such
fidelity
be
much
too
humble
-
minded
to
think
for
itself
.
<EOS>
well
,
in
a
word
,
she
and
her
mother
perform
a
great
day
's
shopping
,
and
she
acquit
herself
with
considerable
liveliness
and
credit
on
this
her
first
appearance
in
the
genteel
world
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
George
meanwhile
,
with
his
hat
on
one
side
,
his
elbow
square
,
and
his
swagger
martial
air
,
make
for
Bedford
Row
,
and
stalk
into
the
attorney
's
office
as
if
he
be
lord
of
every
pale
-
faced
clerk
who
be
scribble
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
order
somebody
to
inform
Mr.
Higgs
that
Captain
Osborne
be
wait
,
in
a
fierce
and
patronizing
way
,
as
if
the
pekin
of
an
attorney
,
who
have
thrice
his
brain
,
fifty
time
his
money
,
and
a
thousand
time
his
experience
,
be
a
wretched
underling
who
should
instantly
leave
all
his
business
in
life
to
attend
on
the
Captain
's
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
see
the
sneer
of
contempt
which
pass
all
round
the
room
,
from
the
first
clerk
to
the
article
gent
,
from
the
article
gent
to
the
ragged
writer
and
white

face
runner
,
in
clothe
too
tight
for
them
,
as
he
sate
there
tap
his
boot
with
his
cane
,
and
think
what
a
parcel
of
miserable
poor
devil
these
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
miserable
poor
devil
know
all
about
his
affair
.
 
<EOS>
They
talk
about
them
over
their
pint
of
beer
at
their
public

house
club
to
other
clerk
of
a
night
.
<EOS>
ye
god
,
what
do
not

clerk
know
in
London
!
<EOS>
nothing
be
hide
from
their
inquisition
,
and
their
family
mutely
rule
our
city
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
George
expect
,
when
he
enter
Mr.
Higgs
's
apartment
,
to
find
that
gentleman
commission
to
give
him
some
message
of
compromise
or
conciliation
from
his
father
;
perhaps
his
haughty
and
cold
demeanour
be
adopt
as
a
sign
of
his
spirit
and
resolution
:
<EOS>
but
if
so
,
his
fierceness
be
meet
by
a
chill
coolness
and
indifference
on
the
attorney
's
part
,
that
render
swagger
absurd

<EOS>
He
pretend
to
be
write
at
a

when

but
he
and
Captain
Porter

take
home
Jos

who
be

George

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
meanwhile
the
gallant
Jos

agree

<EOS>
that
period
of

life
which
now
ensue
be
so
full
of
incident
,
that
it
serve

for
conversation
for
many
year

and
even
the

story
be
put
aside
for
more
stirring
narrative
which
he
have
to
tell
about
the
great
campaign
of
Waterloo

<EOS>
as

<EOS>
at
Chatham
he

<EOS>
He
listen
with
the
utmost
attention
to

<EOS>
in

on

finally
when

which

carry

and
inform

confidentially

a

courier
at

<EOS>
He
suffer
hugely
on
the
voyage

during
which
the

be
likewise
prostrate

but
Amelia
be
bring
to
life
again
as
the

Ostend

by
the
sight
of

convey
her

<EOS>
Jos

<EOS>
this

which
come
very
suddenly

on

last
day
,
so
alarm
Mr.
Sedley
,
junior
,
that
he
be
on
the
point

up

but
Captain
Dobbin
(
who
make
himself
immensely
officious
in
the
business
,
Jos
say
)
,
rate
him
and
laugh
at
him
soundly
:
 
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
in

London
domestic

who
could
only
speak

Dobbin
procure
for
Jos

party
a
swarthy
little
belgian
servant
who
could
speak
no
language
at
all
;
but
who
,
by
his
bustling
behaviour
,
and
by
invariably
address
Mr.
Sedley
as
"
My
lord

"
speedily
acquire
that
gentleman
's
favour
.
 
<EOS>
time
be
alter
at
Ostend
now
;
of
the
briton
who
go
thither
,
very
few
look
like
lord
,
or
act
like
those
member
of
our
hereditary
aristocracy
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
for
the
most
part
shabby
in
attire
,
dingy
of
linen
,
lover
of
billiard
and
brandy
,
and
cigar
and
greasy
ordinary
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
say
as
a
rule
,
that
every
Englishman
in
the
Duke
of
Wellington
's
army
pay
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
such
a
fact
surely
become
a
nation
of
shopkeeper
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
blessing
for
a
commerce
-
love
country
to
be
overrun
by
such
an
army
of
customer
:
and
to
have
such
creditable
warrior
to
feed
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
country
which
they
come
to
protect
be
not
military
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
long
period
of
history
they
have
let
other
people
fight
there
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
present
writer
go
to
survey
with
eagle
glance
the
field
of
Waterloo
,
we
ask
the
conductor
of
the
diligence
,
a
portly
warlike
-
look
veteran
,
whether
he
have
be
at
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pas

such
an
answer
and
sentiment
as
no
Frenchman
would
own
to
 
<EOS>
be
his
reply
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
postilion
who
drive
us
be
a
Viscount
,
a
son
of
some
bankrupt
Imperial
General
,
who
accept
a
pennyworth
of
beer
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
the
moral
be
surely
a
good
one
.
  
<EOS>
this
flat

flourish

easy
country
never
could
have
look
more
rich
and
prosperous
than
in
that
open
summer
of
1815

when
its

<EOS>
have
frequently
be
in
presence
of
the
enemy
,
or
,
in
other
word
,
face
the
lady
at
Cheltenham
and
Bath
,
our
friend
,
the
Collector
,
have
lose
a
great
deal
of
his
pristine
timidity
,
and
be
now
,
especially
when
fortify
with
liquor
,
as
talkative
as
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
a
favourite
with
the
regiment
,
treat
the
young
officer
with
sumptuosity
,
and
amuse
them
by
his
military
air
.
<EOS>
and
as
there
be
one
well
-
know
regiment
of
the
army
which
travel
with
a
goat
head
the
column
,
whilst
another
be
lead
by
a
deer
,
George
say
with
respect
to
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
that
his
regiment
march
with
an
elephant
.
  
<EOS>
since
Amelia
's
introduction
to
the
regiment
,
George
begin
to
be
rather
ashamed
of
some
of
the
company
to
which
he
have
be
force
to
present
her
;
and
determine
,
as
he
tell
Dobbin
(
with
what
satisfaction
to
the
latter
it
nee
not
be
say
)
,
to
exchange
into
some
well
regiment
soon
,
and
to
get
his
wife
away
from
those
damned
vulgar
woman
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
vulgarity
of
be
ashamed
of
one
's
society
be
much
more
common
among
man
than
woman
(
except
very
great
lady
of
fashion
,
who
,
to
be
sure
,
indulge
in
it
)
;
and
Mrs.
Amelia
,
a
natural
and
unaffected
person
,
have
none
of
that
artificial
shamefacedness
which
her
husband
mistake
for
delicacy
on
his
own
part
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
Mrs.
O'Dowd
have
a
cock
's
plume
in
her
hat
,
and
a
very
large
"
repayther
"
on
her
stomach
,
which
she
use
to
ring
on
all
occasion
,
narrate
how
it
have
be
present
to
her
by
her
fawther
,
as
she
stipt
into
the
car'ge
after
her
mar'ge
;
and
these
ornament
,
with
other
outward
peculiarity
of
the
Major
's
wife
,
give
excruciating
agony
to
Captain
Osborne
,
when
his
wife
and
the
Major
's
come
in
contact
;
whereas
Amelia
be
only
amuse
by
the
honest
lady
's
eccentricity
,
and
not
in
the
least
ashamed
of
her
company
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
make
that
well

journey
,
which
almost
every
Englishman
of
middle

travel

He

Old

She

her

and
shoot
out
bloodshot
glance
at
her

George

She

in
cordiality

<EOS>
"
how

<EOS>
but
I

not
ask

<EOS>
"
Shall
I

you

say
the
General

burst
with
wrath

<EOS>
"
let
me
go

I
entreat
you

George

<EOS>
"
no

I

Dear

sweet

<EOS>
give
me
your

Captain
George

;
and
so
say
,
and
with
a
nod
to
the
General
,
she
trip
into
the
lobby

<EOS>
She
give
George
the
queer
,
<EOS>
knowing
look
,
when
they
be
together

a
look
which
may
have
be
interpret
,
"
do

what
a
fool

He

think
of
his
own

lose
in
pompous
admiration

his

irresistible
power

pleasing

<EOS>
the
curse
to
which
the
General
give
a
low
utterance
,
as
soon
as
Rebecca
and
her
conqueror
have
quit
him

be
so
deep
,
that
I
be
sure
no
compositor
would
venture
to
print
them
<EOS>
be
they
write
down

<EOS>
They
come
from
the
General
's
heart
;
and
a
wonderful
thing
it
be
to
think
that
the
human
heart
be
capable

generate
such
produce

and
can
throw
out

as
occasion

such
a

rage

<EOS>
Amelia

fix
anxiously
on
the

when
Rebecca

she
fly
to
her
friend
with
an
affectionate
rapture
which
show
itself
,
in

she
embrace
her

the
whole

at

in

Mrs.

Mrs.

both
Amelia

her
for
this
timely

Amelia

<EOS>
even
the

I
do

Dobbin

;
and
his
advice
meet
with
the
success
which
advice
usually
command

<EOS>
Osborne

Crawley
be
repeatedly
together
now

<EOS>
General

abroad
almost
constantly

<EOS>
George

which
the

<EOS>
Amelia

manner
be
such
when
she
and
George
visit
Crawley
and
his
wife
at
these
quarter
,
that
they
have
very
nearly
come
to
their
first
quarrel
;
that
is
,
George
scold
his
wife
violently
for
her
evident
unwillingness
to
go
,
and
the
high
and
mighty
manner
in
which
she
comport
herself
towards
Mrs.
Crawley
,
her
old
friend
;
and
Amelia
do
not

one
single

with
her

eye
upon

Rebecca
scanning

be
,
if
possible
,
more
bashful
and
awkward
on
the
second
visit
which
she
pay
to
Mrs.
Rawdon

than
on

first
call

<EOS>
Rebecca
be
doubly
affectionate

of

and
would
not
take
notice
,
in

of
her

coolness

I

<EOS>
"
upon

I

when

Brighton
she

do
me

honour

me

I

We

<EOS>
George
accept
the
invitation
,
although
his
wife
be
a
little
ailing
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
not
quite
six
week
marry
.
<EOS>
another
woman
be
laugh
or
sneer
at
her
expense
,
and
he
not
angry
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
even
angry
with
himself
,
this
good
-
natured
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
shame
,
he
own
to
himself
;
but
hang
it
,
if
a
pretty
woman
WILL
throw
herself
in
your
way
,
why
,
what
can
a
fellow
do
,
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
rather
free
about
woman
,
he
have
often
say
,
smile
and
nod
knowingly
to
Stubble
and
Spooney
,
and
other
comrade
of
the
mess
-
table
;
and
they
rather
respect
him
than
otherwise
for
this
prowess
.
 
<EOS>
next
to
conquer
in
war
,
conquer
in
love
have
be
a
source
of
pride
,
time
out
of
mind
,
amongst
man
in
Vanity
Fair
,
or
how
should
schoolboys
brag
of
their
amour
,
or
Don
Juan
be
popular
?
  
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Osborne
,
have
a
firm
conviction
in
his
own
mind
that
he
be
a
woman
-
killer
and
destine
to
conquer
,
do
not
run
counter
to
his
fate
,
but
yield
himself
up
to
it
quite
complacently
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
Emmy
do
not
say
much
or
plague
him
with
her
jealousy
,
but
merely
become
unhappy
and
pined
over
it
miserably
in
secret
,
he
choose
to
fancy
that
she
be
not
suspicious
of
what
all
his
acquaintance
be
perfectly
aware
 
namely
,
that
he
be
carry
on
a
desperate
flirtation
with
Mrs.
Crawley
.
 
<EOS>
He
ride
with
her
whenever
she
be
free
.
 
<EOS>
He
pretend
regimental
business
to
Amelia
(
by
which
falsehood
<EOS>
she
be
not
in
the
least
deceive
)
,
and
consign
his
wife
to
solitude
or
her
brother
's
society
,
pass
his
evening
in
the
Crawleys
'
company
;
lose
money
to
the
husband
and
flatter
himself
that
the
wife
be
die
of
love
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
likely
that
this
worthy
couple
never
absolutely
conspire
and
agree
together
in
so
many
word
:
 
the
one
to
cajole
the
young
gentleman
,
whilst
the
other
win
his
money
at
card
:
but
they
understand
each
other
perfectly
well
,
and
Rawdon
let
Osborne
come
and
go
with
entire
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
George
be
so
occupied
with
his
new
acquaintance
that
he
and
William
Dobbin
be
by
no
means
so
much
together
as
formerly
.
<EOS>
George
avoid
him
in
public
and
in
the
regiment
,
and
,
as
we
see
,
do
not
like
those
sermon
which
his
senior
be
dispose
to
inflict
upon
him
.
<EOS>
if
some
part
of
his
conduct
make
Captain
Dobbin
exceedingly
grave
and
cool
;
of
what
use
be
it
to
tell
George
that
,
though
his
whisker
be
large
,
and
his
own
opinion
of
his
knowingness
great
,
he
be
as
green
as
a
schoolboy
?
<EOS>
that
Rawdon
be
make
a
victim
of
him
as
he
have
do
of
many
before
,
and
as
soon
as
he
have
use
him
would
fling
him
off
with
scorn
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
listen
:
 
and
<EOS>
so
,
as
Dobbin
,
upon
those
day
when
he
visit
the
Osborne
house
,
seldom
have
the
advantage
of
meet
his
old
friend
,
much
painful
and
unavaile
talk
between
them
be
spare
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
George
be
in
the
full
career
of
the
pleasure
of
Vanity
Fair
.
  
<EOS>
there
never
be
,
since
the
day
of
Darius
,
such
a
brilliant
train
of
camp
-
follower
as
hang
round
the
Duke
of
Wellington
's
army
in
the
Low
Countries
,
in
1815
;
and
lead
it
dance
and
feasting
,
as
it
be
,
up
to
the
very
brink
of
battle
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
ball
which
a
noble
Duchess
give
at
Brussels
on
the
15th
of
June
in
the
above

year
be
historical

<EOS>
all
Brussels
have
be
in
a
state
of
excitement
about
it

and
I
have
hear
from
lady
who
be
in
that
town
at
the
period
,
that
the
talk
and
interest
of
person
of
their
own
sex
regard
the
ball
be
much
great
even
than
in
respect
of
the
enemy
in
their
front
.
<EOS>
the
struggle
,
intrigue
,
and
prayer
to
get
ticket
be
such
as
only
english
lady
will
employ
,
in
order
to
gain
admission
to
the
society
of
the
great

their
own
nation

<EOS>
Jos
and
Mrs.
O'Dowd
,
who
be
pant
to
be
ask
,
strove
in
vain
to
procure
ticket
;
but
other
of
our
friend
be
more
lucky
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
through
the
interest
of
my
Lord
Bareacres
,
and
as
a
set
-
off
for
the
dinner
at
the
restaurateur
's
,
George
get
a
card
for
Captain
and
Mrs.
Osborne
;
which
circumstance
greatly
elate
him
.
<EOS>
Dobbin
,
who
be
a
friend
of
the
General
command
the
division
in
which
their
regiment
be
,
come
laugh
one
day
to
Mrs.
Osborne
,
and
display
a
similar
invitation
,
which
make
Jos
envious
,
and
George
wonder
how
the
deuce
he
should
be
get
into
society
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rawdon
,
finally
,
be
of
course
invite
;
as
become
the
friend
of
a
General

<EOS>
on
the

night

George

have
command
new
dress
and
ornament
of
all
sort
for
Amelia
,
drive
to
the
famous
ball
,
where
his
wife
do
not
know
a
single
soul
.
 
<EOS>
after
look
about
for
Lady
Bareacres
,
who
cut
him
,
think
the
card
be
quite
enough
 
and
after
place
Amelia
on
a
bench
,
he
leave
her
to
her
own
cogitation
there
,
think
,
on
his
own
part
,
that
he
have
behave
very
handsomely
in
get
her
new
clothe
,
and
bring
her
to
the
ball
,
where
she
be
free
to
amuse
herself
as
she
like
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thought
be
not
of
the
pleasantest
,

nobody
except
honest
Dobbin
come
to
disturb
them

<EOS>
whilst
her
appearance
be
an
utter
failure

Her

<EOS>
in
the

of
the
great
person
assemble
,
and
the
eye

glass
direct
to
her
,
Rebecca
seem
to
be
as
cool
and
collect
as
when
she
use
to
marshal
Miss
Pinkerton
's
little
girl
to
church
.
<EOS>
number
of
the
man
she
know
already
,
and
the
dandy
throng
round
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
lady
,
it
be
whisper
among
them
that
Rawdon
have
run
away
with
her
from
out
of
a
convent
,
and
that
she
be
a
relation
of
the
Montmorency
family
.
 
<EOS>
She
speak
French
so
perfectly
that
there
may
be
some
truth
in
this
report
,
and
it
be
agree
that
her
manner
be
fine
,
and
her
air
distingue
.
 
<EOS>
fifty

-
be
partner
throng
round
her
at
once
,
and
press
to
have
the
honour
to
dance
with
her

<EOS>
but
she
say
she
be
engage
,
and
only
go
to
dance
very
little
;
and
make
her
way
at
once
to
the
place
where
Emmy
sate
quite
unnoticed
,
and
dismally
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
to
finish
the
poor
child
at
once
,
Mrs.
Rawdon
run
and
greet
affectionately
her
dear
Amelia
,
and
begin
forthwith
to
patronise
her
.
<EOS>
She
find
fault
with
her
friend
's
dress
,
and
her
hairdresser
,
and
wonder
how
she
could
be
so
chaussee
,
and
vow
that
she
must
send
her
corsetiere
the
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
vow
that
it
be
a
delightful
ball
;
that
there
be
everybody
that
every
one
know
,
and
only
a
very
few
nobody
in
the
whole
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fact
,
that
in
a
fortnight
,
and
after
three
dinner
in
general
society
,
this
young
woman
have
get
up
the
genteel
jargon
so
well
,
that
a
native
could
not
speak
it
better
;
and
it
be
only
from
her
French
be
so
good
,
that
you
could
know
she
be
not
a

woman
of

George

very
soon
find

<EOS>
Becky

<EOS>
He

very
poor

Rawdon

<EOS>
why
do
not
you
prevent

<EOS>
why
do

you
come
to

of
an
evening

instead
of
mope
at
home
with
that
Captain
Dobbin
?
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
be
tre
aimable
;
but
how
could

love
a

with
foot
of
such
size

Your

<EOS>
and
she

her
bouquet
and
shawl
by
Amelia

side

and
trip
off
with
George
to
dance
.
 
<EOS>
woman

know
how
to
wound
so
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
poison
on
the
tip
of
their
little
shaft
,
which
sting
a
thousand
time
more
than
a

<EOS>
Our
poor
Emmy

who
have
never
hate
,
never
sneer
all
her
life
,
be
powerless
in
the
hand
of
her
remorseless
little
enemy

<EOS>
George
dance
with
Rebecca
twice
or
thrice
 
<EOS>
how
many
time
Amelia
scarcely
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
quite
unnoticed
in
her
corner
,
except
when
Rawdon
come
up
with
some
word
of
clumsy
conversation
:
 
and
later
in
the
evening
,
when
Captain
Dobbin
make
so
bold
as
to
bring
her
refreshment
and
sit
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
to
ask
her
why
she
be
so
sad
;
but
as
a
pretext
for
the
tear
which
be
fill
in
her
eye
,
she
tell
him
that
Mrs.
Crawley
have
alarm
her
by
tell
her
that
George
would
go
on
playing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
curious
,
when
a
man
be
bent
upon
play
,
by
what
clumsy
rogue
he
will
allow
himself
to
be
cheat
,
"
Dobbin
say
;
and
Emmy
say
,
"
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
She
be
think
of
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
loss
of
the
money
that
grieve
her
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
George
come
back
for
Rebecca
's
shawl
and
flower
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
even
condescend
to
come
back
and
say
good
-
bye
to
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
let
her
husband
come
and
go
without
say
a
word
,
and
her
head
fall
on
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Dobbin
have
be
call
away
,
and
be
whisper
deep
in
conversation
with
the
General
of
the
division
,
his
friend
,
and
have
not
see
this
last
parting
.
 
<EOS>
George
go
away
then
with
the
bouquet
;
but
when
he
give
it
to
the
owner
,
there
lie
a
note
,
coil
like
a
snake
among
the
flower
.
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
's
eye
catch
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
use
to
deal
with
note
in
early
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
and
take
the
nosegay
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
by
her
eye
as
they
meet
,
that
she
be
aware
what
she
should
find
there
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
hurry
her
away
,
still
too
intent
upon
his
own
thought
,
seemingly
,
to
take
note
of
any
mark
of
recognition
which
may
pass
between
his
friend
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
however
,
but
trifle
.
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
give
George
her
hand
with
one
of
her
usual
quick
knowing
glance
,
and
make
a
curtsey
and
walk
away
.
 
<EOS>
George
bow
over
the
hand
,
say
nothing
in
reply
to
a
remark
of
Crawley
's
,
do
not
hear
it
even
,
his
brain
be
so
throb
with
triumph
and
excitement
,
and
allow
them
to
go
away
without
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
His
wife
see
the
one
part
at
least
of
the
bouquet
-
scene
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
natural
that
George
should
come
at
Rebecca
's
request
to
get
her
her
scarf
and
flower
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
no
more
than
he
have
do
twenty
time
before
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
day
;
but
now
it
be
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
William

suddenly
cling
to
Dobbin
,
who
be
near

<EOS>
She

him
by
his
christian
name
,
as
George
be
accustomed
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
away
with
her
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
Her
lodging
be
hard
by
;
and
they
thread
through
the
crowd
without
,
where
everything
seem
to
be
more
astir
than
even
in
the
ball
-
room
within
.
  
<EOS>
George
have
be
angry
twice
or
thrice
at
find
his
wife
up
on
his
return
from
the
party
which
he
frequent
:
 
<EOS>
so
she
go
straight
to
bed
now
;
but
although
she
do
not
sleep
,
and
although
the
din
and
clatter
,
and
the
galloping
of
horseman
be
incessant
,
she
never
hear
any
of
these
noise
,
have
quite
other
disturbance
to
keep
her
awake
.
  
<EOS>
Osborne
meanwhile

He

"
everything

"
he
say
.
<EOS>
but
his
luck
at
play
even
do
not
cure
him
of
his
restlessness
,
and
he
start
up
after
awhile
,
pocket
his
winning
,
and
go
to
a
buffet
,
where
he
drink
off
many
bumper

.
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Dobbin
go
up
and
whisper
something
to
him
,
at
which
George

give
a
start
and
a
wild
hurray
,
toss
off
his
glass
,
clap
it
on
the
table
,
and
walk
away
speedily
on
his

arm
.
 
<EOS>

look
for
,
so
sudden
when
it
come
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
love
and
intrigue
now
?
 
<EOS>
He
think
about
a
thousand
thing
but
these
in
his
rapid
walk
to
his
quarter
 
<EOS>
his
past
life
and
future
chance
 
the
fate
which
may
be
before
him
 
<EOS>
the
wife
,
the
child
perhaps
,
from
whom
unseen
he
may
be
about
to
part
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
he
wish
that
night
's
work
undone
!
 
<EOS>
and
that
with
a
clear
conscience
at
least
he
may
say
farewell
to
the
tender
and
guileless
<EOS>
being
by
whose
love
he
have
set
such
little
store
!
  
<EOS>
He
think
over
his
brief
married
life
.
 
<EOS>
in
those
few
week
he
have
frightfully
dissipate
his
little
capital
.
 
<EOS>
how
wild
and
reckless
he
have
be
!
 
<EOS>
Should
any
mischance
befall
him
:
 
what
be
then
leave
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
how
unworthy
he
be
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
he
marry
her
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
fit
for
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
he
disobey
his
father
,
who
have
be
always
so
generous
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
Hope
,
remorse
,
ambition
,
tenderness
,
and
selfish
regret
fill
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
sate
down
and
write
to
his
father
,
remember
what
he
have
say
once
before
,
when
he
be
engage
to
fight
a
duel
.
<EOS>
Dawn
faintly
streak
the
sky
as
he
close
this
farewell
letter
.
 
<EOS>
He
seal
it
,
and
kiss
the
superscription
.
<EOS>
He
think
how
he
have
desert
that
generous
father
,
and
of
the
thousand
kindness
which
the
stern
old
man
have
do
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
look
into
Amelia
's
bedroom
when
he
enter
;
she
lie
quiet
,
and
her
eye
seem
closed
,
and
he
be
glad
that
she
be
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
on
arrive
at
his
quarter
from
the
ball
,
he
have
find
his
regimental
servant
already
make
preparation
for
his
departure
:
 
the
man
have
understand
his
signal
to
be
still
,
and
these
arrangement
be
very
quickly
and
silently
make
.
 
<EOS>
Should
he
go
in
and
wake
Amelia
,
he
think
,
or
leave
a
note
for
her
brother
to
break
the
news
of
departure
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
He
go
in
to
look
at
her
once
again
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
awake
when
he
first
enter
her
room
,
but
have
keep
her
eye
close
,
so
that
even
her
wakefulness
should
not
seem
to
reproach
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
return
,
so
soon
after
herself
,
too
,
this
timid
little
heart
have
feel
more
at
ease

and
turn
towards
him
as
he
stept
softly
out
of
the
room
,
she
have
fall
into
a
light
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
George
come
in
and
look
at
her
again
,
enter
still
more
softly
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
pale
night

lamp
he
could
see
her
sweet
,
pale
face
 
the
purple
eyelid
be

and
closed

and
one

Good

he
stand
at
the

and
look
at

He

and
look
at
the

,
the
little
soft
hand

lie
asleep

and
he
bend
over

noiselessly
towards
the

two

the
poor

with
a
sob
fit
to
break

that
nestle
so
closely
by
his

She

<EOS>
now
the
major
and
his
lady
,
who
have
not
be
invite
to
the
ball
at
which
in
our
last
chapter
other
of
our
friend
figure
,
have
much
more
time
to
take
their
wholesome
natural
rest
in
bed
,
than
be
accord
to
people
who
wish
to
enjoy
pleasure
as
well
as
to
do
duty
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
belief
,
Peggy
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
as
he
placidly
pull
his
nightcap
over
his
ear
,
"
that
there
will
be
such
a
ball
dance
in
a
day
or
two
as
some
of
'em
have
never
hear
the
chune
of
"
;
and
he
be
much
more
happy
to
retire
to
rest
after
partake
of
a
quiet
tumbler
,
than
to
figure
at
any
other
sort
of
amusement
.
<EOS>
Peggy
,
for
her
part
,
would
have
like
to
have
show
her
turban
and
bird
of
paradise
at
the
ball
,
but
for
the
information
which
her
husband
have
give
her
,
and
which
make
her
very
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
like
ye
wake
me
about
half
an
hour
before
the
assembly
beat
,
"
the
Major
say
to
his
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
call
me
at
half
-
past
one
,
Peggy
dear
,
and
see
me
thing
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
will
not
come
back
to
breakfast
,
Mrs.
O'D.
"
with
which
word
,
which
signify
his
opinion
that
the
regiment
would
march
the
next
morning
,
the
Major
cease
talking
,
and
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
O'Dowd
,
the
good
housewife
,
array
in
curl
paper
and
a
camisole
,
feel
that
her
duty
be
to
act
,
and
not
to
sleep
,
at
this
juncture
.
"
<EOS>
Time
enough
for
that
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
,
"
when
Mick
be
go
"
;
and
so
she
pack
his
travel
valise
ready
for
the
march
,
brush
his
cloak
,
his
cap
,
and
other
warlike
habiliment
,
set
them
out
in
order
for
him
;
and
stow
away
in
the
cloak
pocket
a
light
package
of
portable
refreshment
,
and
a
wicker
-
cover
flask
or
pocket
-
pistol
,
contain
near
a
pint
of
a
remarkably
sound
Cognac
brandy
,
of
which
she
and
the
Major
approve
very
much
;
and
as
soon
as
the
hand
of
the
"
repayther
"
point
to
half
-
past
one
,
and
its
interior
arrangement
(
it
have
a
tone
quite
equal
to
a
cathaydral
,
its
fair
owner
consider
)
knell
forth
that
fatal
hour
,
Mrs.
O'Dowd
wake
up
her
Major
,
and
have
as
comfortable
a
cup
of
coffee
prepare
for
him
as
any
make
that
morning
in
Brussels
.
<EOS>
and
who
be
there
will
deny
that
this
worthy
lady
's
preparation
betoken
affection
as
much
as
the
fit
of
tear
and
hysteric
by
which
more
sensitive
female
exhibit
their
love
,
and
that
their
partaking
of
this
coffee
,
which
they
drink
together
while
the
bugle
be
sound
the
turn
-
out
and
the
drum
beat
in
the
various
quarter
of
the
town
,
be
not
more
useful
and
to
the
purpose
than
the
outpouring
of
any
mere
sentiment
could
be
?
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
the
Major
appear
on
parade
quite
trim
,
fresh
,
and
alert
,
his
well
-
shave
rosy
countenance
,
as
he
sate
on
horseback
,
give
cheerfulness
and
confidence
to
the
whole
corps
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
officer
salute
her
when
the
regiment
march
by
the
balcony
on
which
this
brave
woman
stand
,
and
wave
them
a
cheer
as
they
pass
;
and
I
daresay
it
be
not
from
want
of
courage
,
but
from
a
sense
of
female
delicacy
and
propriety
,
that
she
refrain
from
lead
the
gallant
 
th
personally
into
action
.
  
<EOS>
on
Sundays
,
and
at
period
of
a
solemn
nature
,
Mrs.
O'Dowd
use
to
read
with
great
gravity
out
of
a
large
volume
of
her
uncle
the
Dean
's
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
of
great
comfort
to
her
on
board
the
transport
as
they
be
come
home
,
and
be
very
nearly
wreck
,
on
their
return
from
the
West
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
regiment
's
departure
she
betook
herself
to
this
volume
for
meditation
;
perhaps
she
do
not
understand
much
of
what
she
be
read
,
and
her
thought
be
elsewhere
:
 
but
the
sleep
project
,
with
poor
Mick
's
nightcap
there
on
the
pillow
,
be
quite
a
vain
one
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
or
Donald
march
away
to
glory
with
his
knapsack
on
his
shoulder
,
step
out
briskly
to
the
tune
of
"
the
Girl
I
leave
behind
Me
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
she
who
remain
and
suffer
 
and
have
the
leisure
to
think
,
and
brood
,
and
remember
.
  
<EOS>
know
how
useless
regret
be
,
and
how
the
indulgence
of
sentiment
only
serve
to
make
people
more
miserable
,
Mrs.
Rebecca
wisely
determine
to
give
way
to
no
vain
feeling
of
sorrow
,
and
bear
the
parting
from
her
husband
with
quite
a
spartan
equanimity
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
Captain
Rawdon
himself
be
much
more
affected
at
the
leave
-
taking
than
the
resolute
little
woman
to
whom
he
bade
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
master
this
rude
coarse
nature
;
and
he
love
and
worship
her
with
all
his
faculty
of
regard
and
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
his
life
he
have
never
be
so
happy
,
as
,
during
the
past
few
month
,
his
wife
have
make
him
.
 
<EOS>
all
former
delight
of
turf
,
mess
,
hunting
-
field
,
and
gambling
-
table
;
all
previous
love
and
courtship
of
milliner
,
opera
-
dancer
,
and
the
like
easy
triumph
of
the
clumsy
military
Adonis
,
be
quite
insipid
when
compare
to
the
lawful
matrimonial
pleasure
which
of
late
he
have
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
know
perpetually
how
to
divert
him
;
and
he
have
find
his
house
and
her
society
a
thousand
time
more
pleasant
than
any
place
or
company
which
he
have
ever
frequent
from
his
childhood
until
now
.
<EOS>
and
he
curse
his
past
folly
and
extravagance
,
and
bemoan
his
vast
outlying
debt
above
all
,
which
must
remain
for
ever
as
obstacle
to
prevent
his
wife
's
advancement
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
often
groan
over
these
in
midnight
conversation
with
Rebecca
,
although
as
a
bachelor
they
have
never
give
him
any
disquiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
be
strike
with
this
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
"
hang
it
,
"
he
would
say
(
or
perhaps
use
a
still
strong
expression
out
of
his
simple
vocabulary
)
,
"
<EOS>
before
I
be
married
I
do
not
care
what
bill
I
put
my
name
to
,
and
so
long
as
Moses
would
wait
or
Levy
would
renew
for
three
month
,
I
keep
on
never
mind
.
<EOS>
but
since
I
be
married
,
except
renew
,
of
course
,
I
give
you
my
honour
<EOS>
I
have
not
touch
a
bit
of
stamped
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rebecca
always
know
how
to
conjure
away
these
mood
of
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
stupid
love
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
we
have
not
do
with
your
aunt
yet
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
fail
us
,
be
not
there
what
you
call
the
Gazette
?
<EOS>
or
,
stop
,
when
your
uncle
Bute
's
life
drop
,
I
have
another
scheme
.
<EOS>
the
living
have
always
belong
to
the
young
brother
,
and
why
should
not
you
sell
out
and
go
into
the
Church
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
this
conversion
set
Rawdon
into
roar
of
laughter
:
you
may
have
hear
the
explosion
through
the
hotel
at
midnight
,
and
the
haw
-
haw
of
the
great
dragoon
's
voice
.
<EOS>
General
Tufto
hear
him
from
his
quarter
on
the
first
floor
above
them
;
and
Rebecca
act
the
scene
with
great
spirit
,
and
preach
Rawdon
's
first
sermon
,
to
the
immense
delight
of
the
General
at
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
be
mere
by
-
go
day
and
talk
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
final
news
arrive
that
the
campaign
be
open
,
and
the
troop
be
to
march
,
Rawdon
's
gravity
become
such
that
Becky
rally
him
about
it
in
a
manner
which
rather
hurt
the
feeling
of
the
Guardsman
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
suppose
I
be
afraid
<EOS>
,
Becky
,
I
should
think
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
tremor
in
his
voice
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
pretty
good
mark
for
a
shot
,
and
you
see
if
it
bring
me
down
,
why
I
leave
one
and
perhaps
two
behind
me
whom
I
should
wish
to
provide
for
,
as
I
bring
'em
into
the
scrape
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
laugh
matter
<EOS>
that
,
Mrs.
C.
,
anyways
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rebecca
by
a
hundred
caress
and
kind
word
try
to
soothe
the
feeling
of
the
wound
lover
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
her
vivacity
and
sense
of
humour
get
the
well
of
this
sprightly
creature
(
as
they
would
do
under
most
circumstance
of
life
indeed
)
that
she
would
break
out
with
her
satire
,
but
she
could
soon
put
on
a
demure
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
dear
love
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
,
"
do
you
suppose
I
feel
nothing
?
"
<EOS>
and
hastily
dash
something
from
her
eye
,
she
look
up
in
her
husband
's
face
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
here

say
he

<EOS>
"
if
I

<EOS>
do
not

may
live
to
vex
you
yet

<EOS>
well
,
I
shall
not
take
either
of
my
horse

shall
ride

<EOS>
Bullfinch

with
something

prayer
on

into

which
a

<EOS>
time

at

sun
be
high
in
the
heavens
,
and
our
gallant
friend
of
the
  
th
mile
on
their
march
,
before
the
civilian
appear
in
his
flower
dressing
-
gown
at
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
about
George
's
absence
,
his
brother
-
in
-
law
be
very
easy
in
mind
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Jos
be
rather
pleased
in
his
heart
that
Osborne
be
go
,
for
during
George
's
presence
,
the
other
have
play
but
a
very
secondary
part
in
the
household
,
and
Osborne
do
not
scruple
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
stout
civilian
.
 
<EOS>
but
Emmy
have
always
be
good
and
attentive
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
she
who
minister
to
his
comfort
,
who
superintend
the
dish
that
he
like
,
who
walk
or
ride
with
him
(
as
she
have
many
,
too
many
,
opportunity
of
do
,
for
where
be
George
?
)
<EOS>
and
who
interpose
her
sweet
face
between
his
anger
and
her
husband
's
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
many
timid
remonstrance
have
she
utter
to
George
in
behalf
of
her
brother
,
but
the
former
in
his
trenchant
way
cut
these
entreaty
short
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
an
honest
man
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
<EOS>
if
I
have
a
feeling
I
show
it
,
as
an
honest
man
will
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
deuce
,
my
dear
,
would
you
have
me
behave
respectfully
to
such
a
fool
as
your
brother
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
Jos
be
pleased
with
George
's
absence
.
 
<EOS>
His
plain
hat
,
and
glove
on
a
sideboard
,
and
the
idea
that
the
owner
be
away
,
cause
Jos
I
do
not
know
what
secret
thrill
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
he
will
not
be
trouble
me
this
morning
,
"
Jos
think
,
"
with
his
dandified
air
and
his
impudence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
put
the
Captain
's
hat
into
the
ante
-
room
,
"
he
say
to
Isidor
,
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
will
not
want
it
again
,
"
reply
the
lackey
,
look
knowingly
at
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
He
hate
George
too
,
whose
insolence
towards
him
be
quite
of
the
english
sort
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
ask
if
Madame
be
come
to
breakfast
,
"
Mr.
Sedley
say
with
great
majesty
,
ashamed
to
enter
with
a
servant
upon
the
subject
of
his
dislike
for
George
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
he
have
abuse
his
brother
to
the
valet
a
score
of
time
before
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
 
<EOS>
Madame
could
not
come
to
breakfast
,
and
cut
the
tartine
that
Mr.
Jos
like
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
be
a
great
deal
too
ill
,
and
have
be
in
a
frightful
state
ever
since
her
husband
's
departure
,
so
her
bonne
say
.
<EOS>
Jos
show
his
sympathy
by
pour
her
out
a
large
cup
of
tea
<EOS>
It
be
his
way
of
exhibit
kindness
:
 
and
he
improve
on
this
;
he
not
only
send
her
breakfast
,
but
he
bethink
him
what
delicacy
she
would
most
like
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Isidor
,
the
valet
,
have
look
on
very
sulkily
,
while
Osborne
's
servant
be
dispose
of
his
master
's
baggage
previous
to
the
Captain
's
departure
:
 
for
in
the
first
place
he
hate
Mr.
Osborne
,
whose
conduct
to
him
,
and
to
all
inferior
,
be
generally
overbearing
(
nor
do
the
continental
domestic
like
to
be
treat
with
insolence
as
our
own
better
-
temper
servant
do
)
,
and
secondly
,
he
be
angry
that
so
many
valuable
should
be
remove
from
under
his
hand
,
to
fall
into
other
people
's
possession
when
the
english
discomfiture
should
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
defeat
he
and
a
vast
number
of
other
person
in
Brussels
and
Belgium
do
not
make
the
slight
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
the
almost
universal
belief
be
,
that
the
Emperor
would
divide
the
prussian
and
English
army
,
annihilate
one
after
the
other
,
and
march
into
Brussels
before
three
day
be
over
:
when
all
the
movable
of
his
present
master
,
who
would
be
kill
,
or
fugitive
,
or
prisoner
,
would
lawfully
become
the
property
of
Monsieur
Isidor
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
help
Jos
through
his
toilsome
and
complicate
daily
toilette
,
this
faithful
servant
would
calculate
what
he
should
do
with
the
very
article
with
which
he
be
decorate
his
master
's
person
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
make
a
present
of
the
silver
essence
-
bottle
and
toilet
knicknack
to
a
young
lady
of
whom
he
be
fond
;
and
keep
the
english
cutlery
and
the
large
ruby
pin
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
look
very
smart
upon
one
of
the
fine
frilled
shirt
,
which
,
with
the
gold
-
laced
cap
and
the
frog
frock
coat
,
that
may
easily
be
cut
down
to
suit
his
shape
,
and
the
Captain
's
gold
-
head
cane
,
and
the
great
double
ring
with
the
ruby
,
which
he
would
have
make
into
a
pair
of
beautiful
earring
,
he
calculate
would
make
a
perfect
Adonis
of
himself
,
and
render
Mademoiselle
Reine
an
easy
prey
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
those
sleeve
-
button
will
suit
me
!
"
<EOS>
think
he
,
as
he
fix
a
pair
on
the
fat
pudgy
wrist
of
Mr.
Sedley
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
long
for
sleeve
-
button
;
and
the
Captain
's
boot
with
brass
spur
,
in
the
next
room
,
corbleu
!
<EOS>
what
an
effect
they
will
make
in
the
Allee
Verte
!
"
<EOS>
so
while
Monsieur
Isidor
with
bodily
finger
be
hold
on
to
his
master
's
nose
,
and
shave
the
low
part
of
Jos
's
face
,
his
imagination
be
ramble
along
the
Green
Avenue
,
dress
out
in
a
frog
coat
and
lace
,
and
in
company
with
Mademoiselle
Reine
;
he
be
loiter
in
spirit
on
the
bank
,
and
examine
the
barge
sail
slowly
under
the
cool
shadow
of
the
tree
by
the
canal
,
or
refresh
himself
with
a
mug
of
Faro
at
the
bench
of
a
beer
-
house
on
the
road
to
Laeken
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Joseph
Sedley
,
luckily
for
his
own
peace
,
no
more
know
what
be
pass
in
his
domestic
's
mind
than
the
respected
reader
,
and
I
suspect
what
John
or
Mary
,
whose
wage
we
pay
,
think
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
what
our
servant
think
of
us
!
 
<EOS>
do
we
know
what
our
intimate
and
dear
relation
think
of
us
,
we
should
live
in
a
world
that
we
should
be
glad
to
quit
,
and
in
a
frame
of
mind
and
a
constant
terror
,
that
would
be
perfectly
unbearable
.
<EOS>
so
Jos
's
man
be
mark
his
victim
down
,
as
you
see
one
of
Mr.
Paynter
's
assistant
in
Leadenhall
Street
ornament
an
unconscious
turtle
with
a
placard
on
which
be
write
,
"
soup
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Amelia
's
attendant
be
much
less
selfishly
disposed
.
<EOS>
few
dependent
could
come
near
that
kind
and
gentle
creature
without
pay
their
usual
tribute
of
loyalty
and
affection
to
her
sweet
and
affectionate
nature
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
fact
that
Pauline
,
the
cook
,
console
her
mistress
more
than
anybody
whom
she
see
on
this
wretched
morning
;
for
when
she
find
how
Amelia
remain
for
hour
,
silent
,
motionless
,
and
haggard
,
by
the
window
in
which
she
have
place
herself
to
watch
the
last
bayonet
of
the
column
as
it
march
away
,
the
honest
girl
take
the
lady
's
hand
,
and
say
,
Tenez

Madame

<EOS>
with
which
she
burst
into
tear
,
and
Amelia
fall
into
her
arm
,
do
likewise
,
and
so
each
pity
and
soothe
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
several
time
during
the
forenoon
Mr.
Jos
's
Isidor
go
from
his
lodging
into
the
town
,
and
to
the
gate
of

the

gather
such

bring
back

<EOS>
almost
all
these
gentleman
be
in
heart
partisan
of
the
Emperor

and
have
their
opinion
about
the
speedy
end
of

<EOS>
the
Emperor

proclamation
from

have
be

plentifully

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
it

,
"
this
be
the

<EOS>
then
,
as
after
Austerlitz

as

we

<EOS>
We

let

We

the

<EOS>
soldier

<EOS>
these

Prussians

<EOS>
those
among
you

tell
their

Madmen

<EOS>
a

them

if
they
enter
into
France
it
will
be
to
find
a
grave
there

"
 
<EOS>
but
the
partisan
of
the
French
prophesy
a
more
speedy
extermination
of
the
Emperor
's
enemy
than
this
;
and
it
be
agree
on
all
hand
that
Prussians

British
would
never
return
except
as
prisoner
in
the
rear
of
the

<EOS>
these
opinion
in
the
course
of
the
day
be
bring
to
operate
upon
Mr.

He

Jos

<EOS>
"
You
man
can
bear
anything
,
"
reply
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
parting
or
danger
be
nothing
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
own
now
that
you
be
go
to
join
the
army
and
leave
us
to
our
fate
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
be
 
<EOS>
something
tell
me
you
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
frightened
,
<EOS>
when
the
thought
come
into
my
head
(
for
I
do
sometimes
think
of
you
when
I
be
alone
,
Mr.
Joseph
)
,
that
I
run
off
immediately
to
beg
and
entreat
you
not
to
fly
from
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
speech
may
be
interpret
,
"
My
dear
sir
,
should
an
accident
befall
the
army
,
and
a
retreat
be
necessary
,
you
have
a
very
comfortable
carriage
,
in
which
I
propose
to
take
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
Jos
understand
the
word
in
this
sense
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
profoundly
mortify
by
the
lady
's
inattention
to
him
during
their
stay
at
Brussels
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
present
to
any
of
Rawdon
Crawley
's
great
acquaintance
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
scarcely
be
invite
to
Rebecca
's
party
;
for
he
be
too
timid
to
play
much
,
and
his
presence
bore
George
and
Rawdon
equally
,
who
neither
of
them
,
perhaps
,
like
to
have
a
witness
of
the
amusement
in
which
the
pair
choose
to
indulge
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
think
Jos
,
"
now
she
want
me
she
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
there
be
nobody
else
in
the
way
she
can
think
about
old
Joseph
Sedley
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
besides
these
doubt
he
feel
flatter
at
<EOS>
the
idea
Rebecca
express
of
his
courage
.
  
<EOS>
He
blush
a
good
deal
,
and
put
on
an
air
of
importance
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
the
action
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
every
man
of
any
spirit
would
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
little
service
in
India
,
but
nothing
on
this
grand
scale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
man
would
sacrifice
anything
for
a
pleasure
,
"
Rebecca
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Crawley

me
this
morning
as
gay
as
if
he
be
go
to
a
hunting
party

<EOS>
what
do

<EOS>
what
do
any
of
you
care
for
the
agony
and
torture
of
a
poor
forsaken
woman
?
 
<EOS>
(
I
wonder
whether
he
could
really
have
be
go
to
the
troop

this
great
lazy
gourmand

)
<EOS>
oh

I

<EOS>
I

frightful
danger
into

<EOS>
and
I
come

for
shelter

bent
upon
plunge

<EOS>
I
only
say
I
should

<EOS>
but
my
duty
keep
me
here
:
 
I
can
not

<EOS>
and
he
point
with
his
finger
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
in
which
Amelia
be

<EOS>
"

his

spot
in
question

<EOS>
Rebecca
say
,
fix
her
eye
upon
him
for
an
instant
,
and
then
turn
away
into
the
window

<EOS>
Jos
blush
violently

organ

him
in

Your

Jos

choke
almost
with

upon
the
contemplation
of
the
enchant

anon
shrink
guiltily
before
the
vision
of
the
jealous
Rawdon
Crawley

with
his
curling

fierce
mustachio

his
terrible
duelling
pistol

cocked

appearance
strike
Amelia
with
terror

shrink
back

lift
the
latch

how

what
hour

triumph
scarcely
tell
us

<EOS>
these
be
too
mean
part

you
do

sobs
in
the
midst
of
the
shout
and
jubilation
in

Chorus
of

after
the
first
movement
of
terror
in
Amelia

Regulus
and
his
comrade
look
to
be
as
gallant
<EOS>
a
body
of
man
as
ever
trumpet
sound
for

<EOS>
when
Ney
dash
upon
the
advance
of
the
ally
troop
,
carry
one
position
after
the
other
,
until
the
arrival
of
the
great
body
of
the
british
army
from
Brussels
change
the
aspect
of
the
combat
of
Quatre
Bras
,
the
squadron
among
which
Regulus
ride
show
the
great
activity
in
retreat
before
the
French
,
and
be
dislodge
from
one
post
and
another
which
they
occupy
with
perfect
alacrity
on
their
part
.
 
<EOS>
Their
movement
be
only
check
by
the
advance
of
the
British
in
their
rear
.
 
<EOS>
thus
force
to
halt
,
the
enemy
's
cavalry
(
whose
bloodthirsty
obstinacy
can
not
be
too
severely
reprehend
)
have
at
length
an
opportunity
of
come
to
close
quarter
with
the
brave
Belgians
before
them
;
who
prefer
to
encounter
the
british
rather
than
the
French
,
and
at
once
turn
tail
ride
through
the
english
regiment
that
be
behind
them
,
and
scatter
in
all
direction
.
 
<EOS>
the
regiment
in
fact
do
not
exist
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nowhere
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
no
head
-
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Regulus
find
himself
gallop
many
mile
from
the
field
of
action
,
entirely
alone
;
and
whither
should
he
fly
for
refuge
so
naturally
as
to
that
kitchen
and
those
faithful
arm
in
which
Pauline
have
so
often
welcome
him
?
  
<EOS>
at
some
ten
o'clock
the
clinking
of
a
sabre
may
have
be
hear
up
the
stair
of
the
house
where
the
Osbornes
occupy
a
story
in
the
continental
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
a
knock
may
have
be
hear
at
the
kitchen
door
;
and
poor
Pauline
,
come
back
from
church
,
faint
almost
with
terror
as
she
open
it
and
see
before
her
her
haggard
hussar
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
as
pale
as
the
midnight
dragoon
who
come
to
disturb
Leonora
.
<EOS>
Pauline
would
have
scream
,
but
that
her
cry
would
have
call
her
master
,
and
discover
her
friend
.
 
<EOS>
She
stifle
her
scream
,
then
,
and
lead
her
hero
into
the
kitchen
,
give
him
beer
,
and
the
choice
bit
from
the
dinner
,
which
Jos
have
not
have
the
heart
to
taste
.
 
<EOS>
the
hussar
show
he
be
no
ghost
by
the
prodigious
quantity
of
flesh
and
beer
which
he
devour
 
and
during
the
mouthful
he
tell
his
tale
of
disaster
.
  
<EOS>
His
regiment
have
perform
prodigy
of
courage
,
and
have
withstand
for
a
while
the
onset
of
the
whole
french
army
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
overwhelm
at
last
,
as
be
the
whole
british
army
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
Ney
destroy
each
regiment
as
it
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
Belgians
in
vain
interpose
to
prevent
the
butchery
of
the
English
.
 
<EOS>
the
Brunswickers
be
route
and
have
flee
 
<EOS>
their
Duke
be
kill
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
general
debacle
.
 
<EOS>
He
seek
to
drown
his
sorrow
for
the
defeat
in
flood
of
beer
.
  
<EOS>
Isidor
,
who
have
come
into
the
kitchen
,
hear
the
conversation
and
rush
out
to
inform
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
over
,
"
he
shriek
to
Jos
.
"
<EOS>
Milor

only
one
man

and
he
be
in

kitchen
now
 
come
and
hear
him

"
<EOS>
so
Jos
totter
into
that
apartment
where
Regulus
still
sate
on
the
kitchen
table
,
and
cling
fast
to
his
flagon
of
beer
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
good
french
which
he
could
muster
,
and
which
be
in
sooth
of
a
very
ungrammatical
sort
,
Jos
besought
the
hussar
to
tell
his
tale
.
 
<EOS>
the
disaster
deepen
as
Regulus
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
man
of
his
regiment
not
slay
on
the
field
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
the
Duke
of
Brunswick
fall
,
the
black
hussar
fly
,
the
Ecossais
pound
down
by
the
cannon
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
  
th

"
<EOS>
gasp
Jos
.
  
<EOS>
"
cut
in
piece
,
"
say
the
hussar
 
upon
which
Pauline
cry
out
,
"
o
my

,
ma
bonne
petite
dame
,
"
go
off
fairly
into
hysteric
,
and
fill
the
house
with
her
scream
.
  
<EOS>
Wild
with
terror
,
Mr.
Sedley
know
not
how
or
where
to
seek
for
safety
.
<EOS>
He
rush
from
the
kitchen
back
to
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
cast
an
appealing
look
at
Amelia
's
door
,
which
Mrs.
O'Dowd
have
close
and
lock
in
his
face
;
but
he
remember
how
scornfully
the
latter
have
receive
him
,
and
after
pause
and
listen
for
a
brief
space
at
the
door
,
he
leave
it
,
and
resolve
to
go
into
the
street
,
for
the
first
time
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
seize
a
candle
,
he
look
about
for
his
gold
-
laced
cap
,
and
find
it
lie
in
its
usual
place
,
on
a
console
-
table
,
in
the
anteroom
,
place
before
a
mirror
at
which
Jos
use
to
coquet
,
always
give
his
side
-
lock
a
twirl
,
and
his
cap
the
proper
cock
over
his
eye
,
before
he
go
forth
to
make
appearance
in
public
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
force
of
habit
,
that
even
in
the
midst
of
his
terror
he
begin
mechanically
to
twiddle
with
his
hair
,
and
arrange
the
cock
of
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
look
amazed
at
the
pale
face
in
the
glass
before
him
,
and
especially
at
his
mustachio
,
which
have
attain
a
rich
growth
in
the
course
of
near
seven
week
,
since
they
have
come
into
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
They
WILL
mistake
me
for
a
military
man
,
think
he
,
remember
Isidor
's
warning
as
to
the
massacre
with
which
all
the
defeat

be
threaten
;
and
stagger
back
to
his
bedchamber
<EOS>
,
he
begin
wildly
pull
the
bell
which
summon
his
valet
.
  
<EOS>
Isidor
answer
that
summon
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
have
sink
in
a
chair
 
he
have
tear
off
his
neckcloth
,
and
turn
down
his
collar
,
and
be

with
both
his

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Isidor
think
for
a
moment
he
have
go
mad

and
that
he
wish
his

to
cut
his

<EOS>
"

Joe

<EOS>
his
French
be
of
this
sort
 
voluble
,
as
we
have
say
,
but
not
remarkable
for
grammar
.
  
<EOS>
Isidor
sweep
off
the
mustachio
in
no
time
with
the
razor
,
and
hear
with
inexpressible
delight
his
master
's
order
that
he
should
fetch
a

a
plain

.

<EOS>
this

Jos
select
a
plain
black
coat
and
waistcoat
from
his
stock
,
and
put
on
a
large
white
neckcloth
,
and
a
plain

<EOS>
if
he
could
have
get
a
shovel
hat
he
would
have
wear
it

<EOS>
as
it

you

<EOS>
and
so
have

he
plunge
swiftly
down
the
stair
of
the

and
pass
into
the
street

<EOS>
although
Regulus
have
vow
that
he

man
of
his
regiment
or
of
the
ally
army
,
almost
,
who
have
escape
be
cut
to
piece
by
Ney
,
it
appear
that
his
statement
be
incorrect
,
and
that
a
good
number
more
of
the
suppose
victim
have
survive
the
massacre
.
<EOS>
many
score
of
Regulus
's
comrade
have
find
their
way
back
to
Brussels
,
and
all
agree
that
they
have
run
away
 
fill
the
whole

<EOS>
the

the

and

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
think
Jos
,
in
terror
.
<EOS>
He
make
Isidor
inquire
of
score
of
person
,
whether
they
have
any
to
lend
or
sell
,
and
his
heart
sink
within
him
,
at
the
negative
answer
return
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Should
he
take
the
journey
on
foot
?
 
<EOS>
even
fear
could
not
render
that
ponderous
body
so
active
.
  
<EOS>
almost
all
the
hotel
occupy
by
the
English
in
Brussels
face
the
Parc
,
and
Jos
wander
irresolutely
about
in
this
quarter
,
with
crowd
of
other
people
,
oppress
as
he
be
by
fear
and
curiosity

<EOS>
some

he
see
more
happy
than

have
discover
a
team
of

and
rattle
through

and
who
could
not
for
any
bribe
or
entreaty
procure
the
necessary
mean
of
flight

<EOS>
amongst
these
would

be

Jos
remark
the
Lady
Bareacres

her

who
sate
in
their
carriage
in
the
porte

cochere
of
their

all
their
imperial
pack

and
the
only
drawback
to

be
the

power
which
keep
Jos
stationary

<EOS>
Rebecca

My

Mrs.

with

an

<EOS>
this
curt

bring
the

to
Becky

but
he
could
get

Jos

so
much

<EOS>
Rebecca

measure
the
value
of
the
good
which
she
have
for
sale
by
Jos

eagerness
to
purchase
,
as
well
as
by
the
scarcity

the
article

put
upon
her
horse
a
price
so
prodigious
as

Lord

so

her

<EOS>
once

<EOS>
meanwhile
Jos

<EOS>
Jos
bade
his

He

It

He

He

it

Rumours

another

it

their
ground

<EOS>
this
last
rumour
gradually
get
strength
.
 
<EOS>
no
Frenchmen
have
make
their
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
straggler
have
come
in
from
the
army
bringing
report
more

more
favourable
:
 
at

Brussels
with

for
the
Commandant

who

at
Quatre
Bras

and
the
entire
repulse
of
the
French

Ney
after
a
six
hour

battle

<EOS>
the
aide

must
have
arrive
sometime
while
Jos
and
Rebecca
be

their
bargain
together
,
or
the

<EOS>
when
he
reach
his

hotel
,
he
find
a
score
of
its
numerous
inhabitant
on
the
threshold
discoursing
of
the

there
be
no

as
to
its
truth

<EOS>
and
he
go
up
to
communicate
it
to
the
lady
under
his
charge

<EOS>
He
do
not

it
be
necessary
to
tell
them
how
he

take
leave
of
them
,
how
he
have
buy
horse
,
and
what
a
price
he
have
pay
for
them

<EOS>
but
success
or
defeat
be
a
minor
matter
to
them

who
have
only
think
for
the
safety
of

Amelia

He

Young

his
modesty

coolness

<EOS>
to
these
part
of
the

Amelia
lend
a
very
distracted
attention
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
when
George
be
speak
of
that
she
listen
,
and
when
he
be
not
mention
,
she
think
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
tend

in
thinking
of
the
wonderful
escape
of
the
day
before

her
second
day
pass
away
not
too
slowly
with
Amelia
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
man
in
the

for
her
:
 
and
as
long
as
he
be
well

it
must
be
own
that
its
movement
interest
her
little
.
<EOS>
all
the
report
which
Jos
bring
from
the
street
fall
very
vaguely
on
her
ear
;
though
they
be
sufficient
to
give
that
timorous
gentleman

and
many
other
people
then
in
Brussels
,
every
disquiet
.
 
<EOS>
the
French
have
be
repulse
certainly
,
but
it
be
after
a
severe
and
doubtful
struggle
,
and
with
only
a
division
of
the
french
army
.
<EOS>
the
Emperor
,
with
the
main
body

be
away
at
Ligny

where
he
have
utterly
annihilate
the
Prussians

and
be
now
free
to
bring
his
whole
force
to
bear
upon
the
ally
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Wellington
be
retreat
upon
the
capital
,
and
a
great
battle
must
be
fight
under
its
wall
probably
,
of
which
the
chance
be
more
than
doubtful
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Wellington
have
but
twenty
thousand
british
troop
on
whom
he
could
rely
,
for
the
Germans
be
raw
militia
,
the
Belgians
disaffect

with
this
handful
his
grace
have
to
resist
a
hundred
and

of

and
tremble

<EOS>
so
do
all
the
rest
of
Brussels
 
where
people
feel
that
the
fight
of
the
day
before
be
but
the
prelude
to
the
great
combat
which
be
imminent
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
army

the
Emperor
be
scatter
to
the
wind
already
.
 
<EOS>
the
few
English
that
could
be
bring
to
resist
him
would
perish
at
their
post
,
and
the
conqueror
would
pass
over
their

into
the
city

<EOS>
Woe

<EOS>
the
emigration
still
continue
,
and
wherever
family
could
find
mean
of
departure
,
they
flee
.
 
<EOS>
when
Jos
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
17th
of
June
,
go
to
Rebecca
's
hotel
,
he
find
that
the
great
bareacre

carriage
have
at
length
roll
away
from

<EOS>
the
Earl
have
procure
a
pair
of
horse
somehow
,
in
spite
of
Mrs.
Crawley
,
and
be
roll
on
the
road
to
Ghent
.
 
<EOS>
Louis
<EOS>
the
Desired
be
get
ready
his
portmanteau
in
that
city
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
Misfortune
be
never
tired
of
worry
into
motion
that
unwieldy
exile
.
  
<EOS>
Jos
feel
that
the
delay
of
yesterday
have
be
only
a
respite
,
and
that
his
dearly
buy
horse
must
of
a
surety
be
put
into
requisition
.
 
<EOS>
His
agony
be
very
severe
all
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
as
long
as
there
be
an
english
army
between
Brussels
and
Napoleon
,
there
be
no
need
of
immediate
flight
;
but
he
have
his
horse
bring
from
their
distant
stable
,
to
the
stable
in
the
court
-
yard
of
the
hotel
where
he
live
;
so
that
they
may
be
under
his
own
eye
,
and
beyond
the
risk
of
violent
abduction
.
<EOS>
Isidor
watch
the
stable
-
door
constantly
,
and
have
the
horse
saddle
,
to
be
ready
for
the
start
.
<EOS>
He
long
intensely
for
that
event
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
reception
of
the
previous
day
,
Rebecca
do
not
care
to
come
near
her
dear
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
She
clip
the
bouquet
which
George
have
bring
her
,
and
give
fresh
water
to
the
flower
,
and
read
over
the
letter
which
he
have
send
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
poor
wretch
,
"
she
say
,
twirl
round
the
little
bit
of
paper
in
her
finger
,
"
how
I
could
crush
her
with
this
!
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
for
a
thing
like
this
that
she
must
break
her
heart
,
<EOS>
forsooth
 
for
a
man
who
be
stupid
 
<EOS>
a
coxcomb
 
<EOS>
and
who
do
not
care
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
good
Rawdon
be
worth
ten
of
this
creature
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
fall
to
think
what
she
should
do
if
 
if
anything
happen
to
poor
good
rawdon
,
and
what
a
great
piece
of
luck
it
be
that
he
have
leave
his
horse
behind
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
day
too
,
Mrs.
Crawley
,
who
see
not
without
anger
the
Bareacres
party
drive
off
,
bethought
her
of
the
precaution
which
the
Countess
have
take
,
and
do
a
little
needlework
for
her
own
advantage
;
she
stitch
away
the
major
part
of
her
trinket
,
bill
,
and
bank
-
note
about
her
person
,
and
so
prepared
,
be
ready
for
any
event
 
to
fly
if
she
think
fit
,
or
to
stay
and
welcome
the
conqueror
,
be
he
Englishman
or
Frenchman
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
not
sure
that
she
do
not
dream
that
night
of
become
a
duchess
and
Madame
la
Marechale
,
while
Rawdon
wrap
in
his
cloak
,
and
make
his
bivouac
under
the
rain
at
Mount
Saint
John
,
be
think
,
with
all
the
force
of
his
heart
,
about
the
little
wife
whom
he
have
leave
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
a
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Major
O'Dowd
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
both
her
patient
refresh
in
health
and
spirit
by
some
rest
which
they
have
take
during
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
herself
have
sleep
on
a
great
chair
in
Amelia
's
room
,
ready
to
wait
upon
her
poor
friend
or
the
ensign
,
should
either
need
her
nursing
.
<EOS>
when
morning
come
,
this
robust
woman
go
back
to
the
house
where
she
and
her
Major
have
their
billet
;
and
here
perform
an
elaborate
and
splendid
toilette
,
befit
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
very
possible
that
whilst
alone
in
that
chamber
,
which
her
husband
have
inhabit
,
and
where
his
cap
still
lie
on
the
pillow
,
and
his
cane
stand
in
the
corner
<EOS>
,
one
prayer
at
least
be
send
up
to
Heaven
for
the
welfare
of
the
brave
soldier
,
Michael
O'Dowd
.
  
<EOS>
when

her
prayer

and
her

of
which
she

fail
to
read
every
Sabbath
;
<EOS>
not
understand
all
,
haply
,
not
pronounce
many
of
the

which
be
long
and
abstruse
 
for
the
Dean

a
learned
man
,
and
love
long
latin
word
 
but
with
great
gravity
,
vast
emphasis
,
and
with
tolerable
correctness
in
the
main
.
 
<EOS>
how
often
have
my
Mick

to
these
sermon
,
she
think
,
and
me
read
in
the
cabin
of
a
calm
!
 
<EOS>
She
propose
to
resume
this
exercise
on
the
present
day
,
with
Amelia
and
the
wound
ensign
for
a
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
the

;
and
million

<EOS>
They
do
not

<EOS>
when

<EOS>
He

They

him
 
do
deed
which
make
the
name
of
Crawley
illustrious
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Briggs
,
you
be
a
fool
,
"
say
Miss
Crawley
:
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Crawley
have
drag
the
name
of
Crawley
through
the
mud
,
Miss
Briggs
.
 
<EOS>
marry
a
drawing
-
master
's
daughter
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
marry
a
dame
de
compagnie
 
<EOS>
for
she
be
no
well
,
Briggs
;
no
,
she
be
just
what
you
be
 
only
young
,
and
a
great
deal
prettier
and
cleverer
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
an
accomplice
of
that
abandon
wretch
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
of
whose
vile
art
he
become
a
victim
,
and
of
whom
you
use
to
be
such
an
admirer
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
daresay
you
be
an
accomplice
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
find
yourself
disappointed
in
my
will
,
I
can
tell
you
:
 
and
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
write
to
Mr.
Waxy
,
and
say
that
I
desire
to
see
him
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
be
now
in
the
habit
of
write
to
Mr.
Waxy
her
solicitor
almost
every
day
in
the
week
,
for
her
arrangement
respect
her
property
be
all
revoke
,
and
her
perplexity
be
great
as
to
the
future
disposition
of
her
money
.
  
<EOS>
the
spinster
have
,
however
,
rally
considerably
;
as
be
prove
by
the
increase
vigour
and
frequency
of
her
sarcasm
upon
Miss
Briggs
,
all
which
attack
the
poor
companion
bear
with
meekness
,
with
cowardice
,
with
a
resignation
that
be
half
generous
and
half
hypocritical
 
with
the
slavish
submission
,
in
a
word
,
that
woman
of
her
disposition
and
station
be
compel
to
show
.
 
<EOS>
who
have
not
see
how
woman
bully
woman
?
<EOS>
what
torture
have
man
to
endure
,
comparable
to
those
daily
repeat
shaft
of
scorn
and
cruelty
with
which
poor
woman
be
riddle
by
the
tyrant
of
their
sex
?
 
<EOS>
poor
victim
!
 
<EOS>
but
we
be
start
from
our
proposition
,
which
be
,
that
Miss
Crawley
be
always
particularly
annoying
and
savage
when
she
be
rally
from
illness
 
as
they
say
wound
tingle
most
when
they
be
about
to
heal
.
  
<EOS>
while
thus
approach
,
as
all
hope
,
to
convalescence
,
Miss
Briggs
be
the
only
victim
admit
into
the
presence
of
the
invalid
;
yet
Miss
Crawley
's
relative
afar
off
do
not
forget
their
beloved
kinswoman
,
and
by
a
number
of
token
,
present
,
and
kind
affectionate
message
,
strove
to
keep
themselves
alive
in
her
recollection
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
let
us
mention
her
nephew
,
Rawdon
Crawley
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
week
after
the
famous
fight
of
Waterloo
,
and
after
the
Gazette
have
make
known
to
her
the
promotion
and
gallantry
of
that
distinguished
officer
,
the
dieppe
packet
bring
over
to
Miss
Crawley
at
Brighton
,
a
box
contain
present
,
and
a
dutiful
letter
,
from
the
Colonel
her
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
box
be
a
pair
of
french
epaulet
,
a
Cross
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
,
and
the
hilt
of
a
sword
 
relic
from
the
field
of
battle
:
 
and
the
letter
describe
with
a
good
deal
of
humour
how
the
latter
belong
to
a
command
officer
of
the
Guard
,
who
have
swear
that
"
the
Guard
die
,
but
never
surrender
,
"
be
take
prisoner
the
next
minute
by
a
private
soldier
,
who
break
the
Frenchman
's
sword
with
the
butt
of
his
musket
,
when
Rawdon
make
himself
master
of
the
shatter
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
cross
and
epaulet
,
they
come
from
a
Colonel
of
French
cavalry
,
who
have
fall
under
the
aide
-
de
-
camp
's
arm
in
the
battle
:
and
Rawdon
Crawley
do
not
know
what
well
to
do
with
the
spoil
than
to
send
them
to
his
kind
and
most
affectionate
old
friend
.
<EOS>
Should
he
continue
to
write
to
her
from
Paris
,
whither
the
army
be
march
?
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
able
to
give
her
interesting
news
from
that
capital
,
and
of
some
of
Miss
Crawley
's
old
friend
of
the
emigration
,
to
whom
she
have
show
so
much
kindness
during
their
distress
.
  
<EOS>
the
spinster
cause
Briggs
to
write
back
to
the
Colonel
a
gracious
and
complimentary
letter
,
encourage
him
to
continue
his
correspondence
.
<EOS>
His
first
letter
be
so
excessively
lively
and
amusing
that
she
should
look
with
pleasure
for
its
successor
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
I
know
,
"
she
explain
to
Miss
Briggs
,
"
that
Rawdon
could
not
write
such
a
good
letter
any
more
than
you
could
,
my
poor
Briggs
,
and
that
it
be
that
clever
little
wretch
of
a
Rebecca
,
who
dictate
every
word
to
him
;
but
that
be
no
reason
why
my
nephew
should
not
amuse
me
;
and
so
I
wish
to
let
him
understand
that
I
be
in
high
good
humour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
she
know
that
it
be
not
only
Becky
who
write
the
letter
,
but
that
Mrs.
Rawdon
actually
take
and
send
home
the
trophy
which
she
buy
for
a
few
franc
,
from
one
of
the
innumerable
pedlar
who
immediately
begin
to
deal
in
relic
of
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
the
novelist
,
who
know
everything
,
know
this
also
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
,
however
,
as
it
may
,
Miss
Crawley
's
gracious
reply
greatly
encourage
our
young
friend
,
Rawdon
and
his
lady
,
who
hope
for
the
good
from
their
aunt
's
evidently
pacified
humour
:
 
and
they
take
care
to
entertain
her
with
many
delightful
letter
from
Paris
,
whither
,
as
Rawdon
say
,
they
have
the
good
luck
to
go
in
the
track
of
the
conquer
army
.
  
<EOS>
to
the
rector
's
lady
,
who
go
off
to
tend
her
husband
's
break
collar
-
bone
at
the
Rectory
at
Queen
's
Crawley
,
the
spinster
's
communication
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
gracious
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
,
that
brisk
,
managing
,
lively
,
imperious
woman
,
have
commit
the
most
fatal
of
all
error
with
regard
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
merely
oppress
her
and
her
household
 
<EOS>
she
have
bore
Miss
Crawley
;
and
if
poor
Miss
Briggs
have
be
a
woman
of
any
spirit
,
she
may
have
be
make
happy
by
the
commission
which
her
principal
give
her
to
write
a
letter
to
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
,
say
that
Miss
Crawley
's
health
be
greatly
improve
since
Mrs.
Bute
have
leave
her
,
and
beg
the
latter
on
no
account
to
put
herself
to
trouble
,
or
quit
her
family
for
Miss
Crawley
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
this
triumph
over
a
lady
who
have
be
very
haughty
and
cruel
in
her
behaviour
to
Miss
Briggs
,
would
have
rejoice
most
woman
;
but
the
truth
be
,
Briggs
be
a
woman
of
no
spirit
at
all
,
and
the
moment
her
enemy
be
discomfit
,
she
begin
to
feel
compassion
in
her
favour
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
silly
I
be
,
"
Mrs.
Bute
think
,
and
with
reason
,
"
ever
to
hint
that
I
be
come
,
as
I
do
,
in
that
foolish
letter
when
we
send
Miss
Crawley
the
guinea
-
fowl
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
go
without
a
word
to
the
poor
dear
dote
old
creature
,
and
take
her
out
of
the
hand
of
that
ninny
Briggs
,
and
that
harpy
of
a
femme
de
chambre
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Bute
,
Bute
<EOS>
,
why
do
you
break
your
collar
-
bone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
We
have
see
how
Mrs.
Bute
,
have
the
game
in
her
hand
,
have
really
play
her
card
too
well
.
<EOS>
She
have
rule
over
Miss
Crawley
's
household
utterly
and
completely
,
to
be
utterly
and
completely
route
when
a
favourable
opportunity
for
rebellion
come
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
household
,
however
,
consider
that
she
have
be
the
victim
of
horrible
selfishness
and
treason
,
and
that
her
sacrifice
in
Miss
Crawley
's
behalf
have
meet
with
the
most
savage
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
Rawdon
's
promotion
,
and
the
honourable
mention
make
of
his
name
in
the
Gazette
,
fill
this
good
christian
lady
also
with
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
Would
his
aunt
relent
towards
him
now
that
he
be
a
Lieutenant
-
Colonel
and
a
C.B.
?
<EOS>
and
would
that
odious
Rebecca
once
more
get
into
favour
?
<EOS>
the
Rector
's
wife
write
a
sermon
for
her
husband
about
the
vanity
of
military
glory
and
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
,
which
the
worthy
parson
read
in
his
good
voice
and
without
understand
one
syllable
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
Pitt
Crawley
for
one
of
his
auditor
 
Pitt
,
who
have
come
with
his
two
half
-
sister
to
church
,
which
the
old
Baronet
could
now
by
no
means
be
bring
to
frequent
.
  
<EOS>
since
the
departure
of
Becky
Sharp
,
that
old
wretch
have
give
himself
up
entirely
to
his
bad
course
,
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
county
and
the
mute
horror
of
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
the
ribbon
in
Miss
Horrocks
's
cap
become
more
splendid
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
the
polite
family
flee
the
hall
and
its
owner
in
terror
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
go
about
tipple
at
his
tenant
'
house
;
and
drink
rum
-
and
-
water
with
the
farmer
at
Mudbury
and
the
neighbouring
place
on
market
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
drive
the
family
coach
-
and
-
four
to
Southampton
with
Miss
Horrocks
inside
:
 
and
the
county
people
expect
,
every
week
,
as
his
son
do
in
speechless
agony
,
that
his
marriage
with
her
would
be
announce
in
the
provincial
paper
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
rude
burthen
for
Mr.
Crawley
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
His
eloquence
be
palsy
at
the
missionary
meeting
,
and
other
religious
assembly
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
he
have
be
in
the
habit
of
preside
,
and
of
speak
for
hour
;
for
he
feel
,
when
he
rise
,
that
the
audience
say
,
"
that
be
the
son
of
the
old
reprobate
Sir
Pitt
,
who
be
very
likely
drinking
at
the
public
house
at
this
very
moment
.
"
<EOS>
and
once
when
he
be
speak
of
the
benighted
condition
of
the
king
of
Timbuctoo
,
and
the
number
of
his
wife
who
be
likewise
in
darkness
,
some
gipsy
miscreant
from
the
crowd
ask
,
"
how
many
be
there
at
Queen
's
Crawley
,
Young
Squaretoes
?
"
to
the
surprise
of
the
platform
,
and
the
ruin
of
Mr.
Pitt
's
speech
.
<EOS>
and
the
two
daughter
of
the
house
of
Queen
's
Crawley
would
have
be
allow
to
run
utterly
wild
<EOS>
(
for
Sir
Pitt
swear
that
no
governess
should
ever
enter
into
his
door
again
)
,
have
not
Mr.
Crawley
,
by
threaten
the
old
gentleman
,
force
the
latter
to
send
them
to
school
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
as
we
have
say
,
whatever
individual
difference
there
may
be
between
them
all
,
Miss
Crawley
's
dear
nephew
and
niece
be
unanimous
in
love
her
and
send
her
token
of
affection
.
<EOS>
thus
Mrs.
Bute
send
guinea
-
fowl
,
and
some
remarkably
fine
cauliflower
,
and
a
pretty
purse
or
pincushion
work
by
her
darle
girl
,
who
beg
to
keep
a
little
place
in
the
recollection
of
their
dear
aunt
,
while
Mr.
Pitt
send
peach
and
grape
and
venison
from
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
the
Southampton
coach
use
to
carry
these
token
of
affection
to
Miss
Crawley
at
Brighton
:
 
<EOS>
it
use
sometimes
to
convey
Mr.
Pitt
thither
too
:
for
his
difference
with
Sir
Pitt
cause
Mr.
Crawley
to
absent
himself
a
good
deal
from
home
now
:
 
and
besides
,
he
have
an
attraction
at
Brighton
in
the
person
of
the
Lady
Jane
Sheepshanks
,
whose
engagement
to
Mr.
Crawley
have
be
formerly
mention
in
this
history
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
and
her
sister
live
at
Brighton
with
their
mamma
,
the
Countess
Southdown
,
that
strong
-
minded
woman
so
favourably
know
in
the
serious
world
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
word
ought
to
be
say
regard
her
Ladyship
and
her
noble
family
,
who
be
bind
by
tie
of
present
and
future
relationship
to
the
house
of
Crawley
.
<EOS>
respect
the
chief
of
the
Southdown
family
,
Clement
William
,
fourth
Earl
of
Southdown
,
little
need
be
tell
,
except
that
his
lordship
come
into
Parliament
(
as
Lord
Wolsey
)
under
the
auspex
of
Mr.
Wilberforce
,
and
for
a
time
be
a
credit
to
his
political
sponsor
,
and
decidedly
a
serious
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
word
can
not
describe
the
feeling
of
his
admirable
mother
,
when
she
learn
,
very
shortly
after
her
noble
husband
's
demise
,
that
her
son
be
a
member
of
several
worldly
club
,
have
lose
largely
at
play
at
Wattier

and
the
Cocoa
Tree

that
he

and
encumber
the
family
estate
;
that
he

ring
;
and
that
he
actually
have
an
opera

box
,
where
he

the
most
dangerous
bachelor
company
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
only

groan
in
the
dowager

circle
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lady
Emily

senior

many
year

and
take
considerable
rank
in
the
serious
world
as

some
of
the
delightful

and
spiritual

faint

her
love
for

almost
all

<EOS>
It
be
to
her

I
believe
,
we
owe
that
beautiful
poem
.
    
<EOS>
lead
us
to
some
sunny
isle

yonder
in
the
western

in

even

<EOS>
Lady

blush
too
as
she
hold
out
a
kind
little
hand
to
Miss

,
and
say
something
very
civil
and
incoherent
about
mamma
,
and
propose
to
call
on
Miss
Crawley
,
and
be
glad
to
be
make
known
to
the
friend
and
relative
of
Mr.

;
and
with
soft
dove
-
like
eye
salute
Miss
Briggs
as
they
separate
,
while
Pitt
Crawley
treat
her
to
a
profound
courtly
bow

such
as
he

H.H.

<EOS>
the
artful
diplomatist

disciple
of
the
Machiavellian
Binkie

<EOS>
It
be
he
who
have
give
Lady
Jane
that
copy
of
poor
Briggs
's
early
poem
,
which
he
remember
to
have
see
at
Queen
's
Crawley
,
with
a
dedication
from
the
poetess
to
his
father
's
late
wife
;
and
he
bring
the
volume
with
him
to
Brighton
,
read
it
in
the
Southampton
coach

mark
it
with
his
own
pencil
,
before
he
present
it
to
the
gentle
Lady

<EOS>
It
be
he
,
too

who
lay
before
Lady

the
great
advantage
which
may
occur
from
an
intimacy
between
her
family
and
Miss
Crawley
 
advantage
both
worldly
and
spiritual
,
he
say
:
 
for
Miss
Crawley
be
now
quite
alone
;
the
monstrous
dissipation
and
alliance
of
his
brother
Rawdon
have
estrange
her
affection
from
that
reprobate
young
man
;
the
greedy
tyranny
and
avarice
of
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
have
cause
the
old
lady
to
revolt
against
the
exorbitant
pretension
of
that
part
of
the
family
;
and
though
he
himself
have
hold
off
all
his
life
from
cultivate
Miss
Crawley
's
friendship
,
with
perhaps
an
improper
pride
,
he
think
now
that
every
become
mean
should
be
take
,
both
to
save
her
soul
from
perdition
,
and
to
secure
her

I
know

well

be
the
very
bad
mean
that
can
be
employ
for
the
welfare

that
unfortunate

<EOS>
You
will
only
frighten

annoy
her

She
will
very
likely
fle
the

away

refuse
all
acquaintance

<EOS>

You

without

how
fatal
a

about

He

have
the
gratification

make
the
acquaintance
of
the
great

good
Mr.
Fox
,
a
statesman
whom
,
however
much
he
may
differ
with
him

it
be
impossible
not
to
admire
fervently
 
a
statesman
who
have
always
have
the
high
opinion
of
the
Emperor
Napoleon

<EOS>
and
he
speak
in
term
of
the
strong
indignation

the
faithless
conduct

this
dethrone
monarch
,
who
,
after
give
himself
generously
up
to
their
mercy
,
be
consign

an
ignoble

cruel
banishment

Her

a

Miss

be
in
opposition

though

to
be
sure
,
the
downfall
of

Emperor
do
not
very
much
agitate
the
old
lady
,
or
his
ill

treatment
tend
to
shorten
her
life
or
natural
rest
,
yet
Pitt
speak
to
her
heart
when
he
laud
both
her
idol

by
that
single
speech
make
immense
progress
in
her
favour

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
say
to
the
young

for
whom
she
have
take
a
liking
at

Lady

though

<EOS>
and
when
the

at

conclusion

visit
,
Miss

hope
"
Lady
Southdown
would
be
so
kind
as
to
send
her
Lady
Jane
sometimes
,
if
she
could
be
spare
to

down

lonely

"
do

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
be
stupid
and
pompous
,
like
all
your
mother
's
family
,
whom
I
never
could
endure
.
 
<EOS>
but
bring
that
nice
good
-
natured
little
Jane
as
often
as
ever
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pitt
promise
that
he
would
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
the
Countess
of
Southdown
what
opinion
his
aunt
have
form
of
her
Ladyship
,
who
,
on
the
contrary
,
think
that
she
have
make
a
most
delightful
and
majestic
impression
on
Miss
Crawley
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
nothing
loth
to
comfort
a
sick
lady
,
and
perhaps
not
sorry
in
her
heart
to
be
free
now
and
again
from
the
dreary
spouting
of
the
Reverend
Bartholomew
Irons
,
and
the
serious
toady
who
gather
round
the
footstool
of
the
pompous
Countess
,
her
mamma
,
Lady
Jane
become
a
pretty
constant
visitor
to
Miss
Crawley
,
accompany
her
in
her
drive
,
and
solace
many
of
her
evening
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
naturally
good
and
soft
,
that
even
Firkin
be
not
jealous
of
her
;
and
the
gentle
Briggs
think
her
friend
be
less
cruel
to
her
when
kind
Lady
Jane
be
by
.
 
<EOS>
towards
her
Ladyship
Miss
Crawley
's
manner
be
charming
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
spinster
tell
her
a
thousand
anecdote
about
her
youth
,
talk
to
her
in
a
very
different
strain
from
that
in
which
she
have
be
accustom
to
converse
with
the
godless
little
Rebecca
;
for
there
be
that
in
Lady
Jane
's
innocence
which
render
light
talk
impertinence
before
her
,
and
Miss
Crawley
be
too
much
of
a
gentlewoman
to
offend
such
purity
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
lady
herself
have
never
receive
kindness
except
from
this
old
spinster
,
and
her
brother
and
father
:
 
<EOS>
and
she
repay
Miss
Crawley
's
engoument
by
artless
sweetness
and
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
autumn
evening
(
when
Rebecca
be
flaunt
at
Paris
,
the
gay
among
the
gay
conqueror
there
,
and
our
Amelia
,
our
dear
wound
Amelia

ah

<EOS>
where
be
she
?
)
<EOS>
Lady
Jane
would
be
sit
in
Miss
Crawley
's
drawing
-
room
singe
sweetly
to
her
,
in
the
twilight
,
her
little
simple
song
and
hymn
,
while
the
sun
be
set
and
the
sea
be
roar
on
the
beach
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
spinster
use
to
wake
up
when
these
ditty
cease
,
and
ask
for
more
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Briggs
,
and
the
quantity
of
tear
of
happiness
which
she
now
shed
as
she
pretend

knit

look
out
at
the
splendid
ocean
darkle
before
the
window

more
brightly
to

who

I

the
happiness

when

<EOS>
He

facetious
at

<EOS>
during

one
or
two
joke
against

quite
unsuspiciously
to

with
some
choice
Oxford
story

<EOS>
He

pugilistic
quality
of
Molyneux
and
Dutch
Sam
,
offer
playfully
to
give
Lady
Jane
the
odd
upon
the
Tutbury
Pet
against
the
rottingdean
man
,
or
take
them
,
as
her

choose
:
and
crown
the
pleasantry

propose
to
back
himself
against
his
cousin
Pitt

either
with

without

"

he

,
with
a
loud

slap
Pitt
on
the
shoulder
,
"
and
my

to
make
it
too

the

knowingly
at

exulting
manner

<EOS>
Pitt
be
not
pleased
altogether
perhaps
,

still
not
unhappy
in
the
main
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Jim
have
his
laugh
out
:
 
and
stagger
across
the
room
with
his
aunt

candle
,
when
the
old
lady
move
to
retire
,
and
offer
to
salute
her
with
the
bland
tipsy
smile
:
 
and
he
take
his
own
leave
and
go
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
perfectly
satisfied
with
himself
,
and
with
a
pleased
notion
that
his
aunt

money
would
be
leave
to
him
in
preference
to
his
father

all
the
rest
of
the
family

<EOS>
once
up

nobody

<EOS>
the
dreadful

<EOS>
anybody

take
the
trouble

look
back
to
a
file
of
the
newspaper
of
the
time

must
,
even
now

feel
at

this
breathless
pause
of
expectation

<EOS>
the
list
of
casualty

:
 
<EOS>
you
stop
in
the
midst
as
in
a
story
which
be
to
be
continue
in
our
next

<EOS>
think
what
the
feeling
must
have
be
as
those
paper
follow
each
other
fresh
from
the
press
;
and
if
such
an
interest
could
be
feel
in
our
country
,
and
about
a
battle
where
but
twenty
thousand
of
our
people
be
engage
,
think
of
the
condition
of
Europe
for
twenty
year
before
,
where
people
be
fight
,
not
by
thousand
,
but
by
million
;
each
one
of
whom
as
he
strike
his
enemy
wound
horribly
some
other
innocent
heart
far
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
news
which
that
famous
Gazette
bring
to
the
Osbornes
give
a
dreadful
shock
to
the
family
and
its
chief
.
<EOS>
the
girl
indulge
unrestrained
in
their
grief
.
 
<EOS>
the
gloom
-
stricken
old
father
be
still
more
bear
down
by
his
fate
and
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
He
strove
to
think
that
a
judgment
be
on
the
boy
for
his
disobedience
.
 
<EOS>
He
dare
not
own
that
the
severity
of
the
sentence
frighten
him
,
and
that
its
fulfilment
have
come
too
soon
upon
his
curse
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
a
shudder
terror
strike
him
,
as
if
he
have
be
the
author
of
the
doom
which
he
have
call
down
on
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
chance
before
of
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
the
boy
's
wife
may
have
die
;
or
he
may
have
come
back
and
say
,
Father
I
have
sin
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
hope
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
on
the
other
side
of
the
gulf
impassable
,
haunt
his
parent
with
sad
eye
.
<EOS>
He
remember
them
once
before
so
in
a
fever
,
when
every
one
think
the
lad
be
die
,
and
he
lie
on
his
bed
speechless
,
and
gaze
with
a
dreadful
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
how
the
father
cling
to
the
doctor
then
,
and
with
what
a
sickening
anxiety
he
follow
him
:
 
what
a
weight
of
grief
be
off
his
mind
when
,
after
the
crisis
of
the
fever
,
the
lad
recover
,
and
look
at
his
father
once
more
with
eye
that
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
no
help
or
cure
,
or
chance
of
reconcilement
:
above
all
,
there
be
no
humble
word
to
soothe
vanity
outraged
and
furious
,
or
bring
to
its
natural
flow
the
poison

angry
blood

<EOS>
and
it
be
hard
to
say
which
pang
<EOS>
it
be
that
tear
the
proud
father
's
heart
most
keenly
 
<EOS>
that
his
son
should
have
go
out
of
the
reach
of
his
forgiveness
,
or
that
the
apology
which
his
own
pride
expect
should
have
escape
him
.
  
<EOS>
whatever
his
sensation
may
have
be
,
however
,
the
stem
old
man
would
have
no
confidant
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
mention
his
son
's
name
to
his
daughter
;
but
order
the
elder
to
place
all
the
female
of
the
establishment
in
mourning
;
and
desire
that
the
male
servant
should
be
similarly

<EOS>
all
party
and
entertainment

of

future
son

,
whose
marriage

day

be
fix

but
there
be
enough
in
Mr.
Osborne
's
appearance
to
prevent
Mr.
Bullock
from
make
any
inquiry
,
or
in
any
way
press
forward
that
ceremony
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
lady
whisper
about
it
under
their
voice
in
the
drawing

room
sometimes
,
whither
the
father
never
come

<EOS>
He
remain
constantly
in

;

close
until
some
time
after

<EOS>
the
Alderman
place
the
letter
on
the
table
,
and
Osborne
stare
at
him
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
.
<EOS>
His
look

who
after
look
guiltily
for
a
little

<EOS>

<EOS>
It

that
one
which
he

before
daybreak
on
the
16th
of
June
,
and
just
before
he
take
leave
of
Amelia

<EOS>
the
great
red
seal
be
emblazon
with
the
sham
coat
of
arm
which
Osborne
have
assume
from
the
Peerage
,
with
"
Pax
in

"
for
a
motto
;
that
of
the
ducal
house
with
which
the
vain
old
man
try
to
fancy
himself
connect
.
<EOS>
the
hand
that

<EOS>
the

seal
that
seal

have
be
rob
from
George

dead

lie
on
the
field
of
battle
.
 
<EOS>
the
father
know
nothing
of
this
,
but
sit
and
look
at
the
letter
in
terrified
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
He
almost
fall
when
he
go
to
open
it
.
  
<EOS>
have
you
ever
have
a
difference
with
a
dear
friend
?

write
in
the
period
of
love

and
rebuke
you

<EOS>
what
a
dreary
mourning
it
be
to
dwell
upon
those
vehement
protest
of
dead
affection
!
 
<EOS>
what
lie
epitaph
they
make
over
the
corpse
of
love
!
<EOS>
what
dark

cruel
comment

Life
and
Vanities

Most

have
get

drawer
full
of

They

we
keep
and
shun

<EOS>
osborne
tremble
long
before
the
letter
from
his
dead
son
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
boy
's
letter
do
not
say
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
too
proud
to
acknowledge
the
tenderness
which
his
heart
feel
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
say
,
that
on
the
eve
of
a
great
battle
,
he
wish
to
bid
his
father
farewell
,
and
solemnly
to
implore
his
good
office
for
the
wife
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
for
the
child
 
whom
he
leave
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
own
with
contrition
that
his
irregularity
and
his
extravagance
have
already
waste
a
large
part
of
his
mother
's
little
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
thank
his
father
for
his
former
generous
conduct
;
and
he
promise
him
that
if
he
fall
on
the
field
or
survive
it
,
he
would
act
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
name
of
George
Osborne
.
  
<EOS>
His
english
habit
,
pride
,
awkwardness
perhaps
,
have
prevent
him
from
say
more
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
could
not
see
the
kiss
George
have
place
on
the
superscription
of
his
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Osborne
drop
it
with
the
bitter
,
deadly
pang
of
balked
affection
and
revenge
.
<EOS>
His
son
be
still
beloved
and
unforgiven
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
month
afterwards
,
however
,
as
the
young
lady
of
the
family
go
to
church
with
their
father
,
they
remark
how
he
take
a
different
seat
from
that
which
he
usually
occupy
when
he
choose
to
attend
divine
worship
;
and
that
from
his
cushion
opposite
,
he
look
up
at
the
wall
over
their
head
.
 
<EOS>
this
cause
the
young
woman
likewise
to
gaze
in
the
direction
towards
which
their
father
's
gloomy
eye
point

<EOS>
Old

<EOS>
He
firmly
believe
that
everything
he
do
be
right

that
he

hatred
rush
out
armed

anything

opposition

<EOS>
He
be
proud
of
his
hatred

everything
else

<EOS>
always
to

always
to
trample
forward

and
never

be
not
these

They
stare
blank

she

nor

He

<EOS>
He
do

much
until

<EOS>
when
her
carriage
have
pass
on
,
he
turn
and
stare
at
the
Sergeant
,
with
a
curse
and
defiance
in
his
eye
cast
at
his
companion
,
who
could
not
help
look
at
him
 
as
much
as
to
say
"
how

<EOS>
damn

<EOS>
I
do

a
minute
afterwards

clatter
over
the
pavement
behind
Osborne

<EOS>
His

make
any
impression

She

Her

It

the
undutifulness

no

He

there

sadly

be
not

her
catastrophe

and
,
stupefy
under

indifferent

<EOS>
She
receive

both
uncomplainingly

accept
them

relapse

<EOS>
suppose
some
twelve
month
after

take
place

have
pass
in

life
of
our
poor
Amelia

<EOS>
She
have
spend
the
first
portion
of
that
time
in
a
sorrow
so
profound
and
pitiable
,
that
we
who
have
be
watch
and
describe
some
of
the
emotion
of
that
weak
and
tender
heart
,
must
draw
back
in
the
presence
of
the
cruel
grief
under
which
it

bleed

<EOS>
Tread
silently
round
the
hapless

poor
prostrate
soul

<EOS>
Shut
gently
the

she
suffer

as

kind
people
do
who
nurse
her
through
the
first
month
of
her
pain
,
and
never
leave
her
until
heaven
have
send
her
consolation

<EOS>
a
day
come
 
of
almost
terrified
delight

wonder

a

it
 
how

wake
again
in

She

<EOS>
the
doctor
who
attend
her
,

have
fear
for
her
life
or
for
her
brain
,
have
wait
anxiously
for
this
crisis
before
they
could
pronounce
that
either
be
secure

<EOS>
It
be
worth
the
long
month
of
doubt

dread
which
the

It

heart
;

if
his

make
him
divine
almost
all

agitate

he
could

<EOS>
I
suppose
Amelia
's
father
and
mother
see
through
the
intention
of
the
Major
,
and
be
not
ill
-
dispose
to
encourage
him
;
for
Dobbin
visit
their
house
daily
,
and
stay
for
hour
with

with
Amelia

with

Mr.
Clapp

He
bring

on

present

almost
every

go

with
the

little

who
be
rather
a
favourite
with
Amelia

by
the

of
Major
Sugarplums

It

this
little
child
who
commonly
act

Mrs.

<EOS>
She
laugh
one
day
when

bring

close
mechanically
round

Amelia

bright
maternal
pleasure

<EOS>
the
cruell
look
could
not

wound
him
more

He
bend
over

He

<EOS>
how
to
live
well
on
nothing
a
year
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
no
man
in
this
Vanity
Fair
of
ours
so
little
observant
as
not
to
think
sometimes
about
the
worldly
affair
of
his
acquaintance
,
or
so
extremely
charitable
as
not
to
wonder
how
his
neighbour
Jones
,
or
his
neighbour
Smith
,
can
make
both
end
meet
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
utmost
regard
for
the
family
,
for
instance
(
for
I
dine
with
them
twice
or
thrice
in
the
season
)
,
I
can
not
but
own
that
the
appearance
of
the
Jenkinses
in
the
park
,
in
the
large
barouche
with
the
grenadier
-
footmen
,
will
surprise
and
mystify
me
to
my
die
day
:
 
<EOS>
for
though
I
know
the
equipage
be
only
jobbed
,
and
all
the
Jenkins
people
be
on
board
wage
,
yet
those
three
man
and
the
carriage
must
represent
an
expense
of
six
hundred
a
year
at
the
very
least
 
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
the
splendid
dinner
,
the
two
boy
at
Eton
,
the
prize
governess
and
master
for
the
girl
,
the
trip
abroad
,
or
to
Eastbourne
or
Worthing
,
in
the
autumn
,
the
annual
ball
with
a
supper
from
Gunter
's
(
who
,
by
the
way
,
supply
most
of
the
first

rate
dinner

J.

as
I
know
very
well
,
have
be
invite
to
one

I

at

be
very
superior
to
the
common
run
of
entertainment
for
which
the
humbler
sort
of
j."s
acquaintance
get
card
)
 
<EOS>
who
,
I
say
,
with
the
most
good
-
natured
feeling
in
the
world
,
can
help
wonder
how
the
Jenkinses
make
out
matter
?
<EOS>
what
be
Jenkins
?
<EOS>
We
all
know
 
Commissioner

the
Tape

Sealing

all

how
do
Jenkins
balance
his

<EOS>
I
say
,
as
every

say
,
how
be
it
that

not

may

young
military
man
mostly
 
who
form
her
husband
's
chief
society
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Colonel
yawn
sadly
among
the
Duchesses
and
great
lady
of
the
Court
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
woman
who
play
ecarte
make
such
a
noise
about
a
five
-
franc
piece
that
it
be
not
worth
<EOS>
Colonel
Crawley
's
<EOS>
while
to
sit
down
at
a
card
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
the
wit
of
their
conversation
he
could
not
appreciate
,
be
ignorant
of
their
language
.
<EOS>
and
what
good
could
his
wife
get
,
he
urge
,
by
make
curtsy
every
night
to
a
whole
circle
of
Princesses
?
<EOS>
He
leave
Rebecca
presently
to
frequent
these
party
alone
,
resume
his
own
simple
pursuit
and
amusement
amongst
the
amiable
friend
of
his
own
choice
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
when
we
say
of
a
gentleman
that
he
live
elegantly
on
nothing
a
year
,
we
use
the
word
"
nothing
"
to
signify
something
unknown
;
meaning
,
simply
,
that
we
do
not
know
how
the
gentleman
in
question
defray
the
expense
of
his
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
our
friend
the
Colonel
have
a
great
aptitude
for
all
game
of
chance
:
and
exercise
himself
,
as
he
continually
do
,
with
the
card
,
the
dice
-
box
,
or
the
cue
,
it
be
natural
to
suppose
that
he
attain
a
much
great
skill
in
the
use
of
these
article
than
man
can
possess
who
only
occasionally
handle
them
.
<EOS>
to
use
a
cue
at
billiard
well
be
like
use
a
pencil
,
or
a
german
flute
,
or
a
small
-
sword
 
<EOS>
you
can
not
master
any
one
of
these
implement
at
first
,
and
it
be
only
by
repeat
study
and
perseverance
,
join
to
a
natural
taste
,
that
a
man
can
excel
in
the
handling
of
either
.
<EOS>
now
Crawley
,
from
be
only
a
brilliant
amateur
,
have
grow
to
be
a
consummate
master
of
billiard
.
 
<EOS>
like
a
great
General
,
his
genius
use
to
rise
with
the
danger
,
and
when
the
luck
have
be
unfavourable
to
him
for
a
whole
game
,
and
the
bet
be
consequently
against
him
,
he
would
,
with
consummate
skill
and
boldness
,
make
some
prodigious
hit
which
would
restore
the
battle
,
and
come
in
a
victor
at
the
end
,
to
the
astonishment
of
everybody
 
of
everybody
,
that
is
,
who
be
a
stranger
to
his
play
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
be
accustomed
to
see
it
be
cautious
how
they
stake
their
money
against
a
man
of
such
sudden
resource
and
brilliant
and
overpowering
skill
.
  
<EOS>
at
game
of
card
he
be
equally
skilful
;
for
though
he
would
constantly
lose
money
at
the
commencement
of
an
evening
,
play
so
carelessly
and
make
such
blunder
,
that
newcomer
be
often
inclined
to
think
meanly
of
his
talent
;
yet
when
rouse
to
action
and
awaken
to
caution
by
repeat
small
loss
,
it
be
remark
that
Crawley
's
play
become
quite
different
,
and
that
he
be
pretty
sure
of
beat
his
enemy
thoroughly
before
the
night
be
over
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
very
few
man
could
say
that
they
ever
have
the
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
His
success
be
so
repeat
that
no
wonder
the
envious
and
the
vanquish
speak
sometimes
with
bitterness
regard
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
the
French
say
of
the
Duke
of
Wellington
,
who
never
suffer
a
defeat
,
that
only
an
astonishing
series
of
lucky
accident
enable
him
to
be
an
invariable
winner
;
yet
even
they
allow
that
he
cheat
at
Waterloo
,
and
be
enable
to
win
the
last
great
trick
:
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
hint
at
headquarters
in
England
that
some
foul
play
must
have
take
place
in
order
to
account
for
the
continuous
success
of
Colonel
Crawley
.
  
<EOS>
though
Frascati
's
and
the
Salon
be
open
at
that
time
in
Paris
,
the
mania
for
play
be
so
widely
spread
that
the
public
gambling
-
room
do
not
suffice
for
the
general
ardour
,
and
gambling
go
on
in
private
house
as
much
as
if
there
have
be
no
public
mean
for
gratify
the
passion
.
 
<EOS>
at
Crawley
's
charming
little
reunion
of
an
evening
this
fatal
amusement
commonly
be
practise
 
much
to
good
-
natured
little
Mrs.
Crawley
's
annoyance
.
<EOS>
She
speak
about
her
husband
's
passion
for
dice
with
the
deep
grief
;
she
bewail
it
to
everybody
who
come
to
her
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
beseech
the
young
fellow
never
,
never
to
touch
a
box
;
and
when
young
Green
,
of
the
Rifles
,
lose
a
very
considerable
sum
of
money
,
Rebecca
pass
a
whole
night
in
tear
,
as
the
servant
tell
the
unfortunate
young
gentleman
,
and
actually
go
on
her
knee
to
her
husband
to
beseech
him
to
remit
the
debt
,
and
burn
the
acknowledgement
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
?
<EOS>
He
have
lose
just
as
much
himself
to
Blackstone
of
the
Hussars
,
and
Count
Punter
of
the
Hanoverian
Cavalry
.
 
<EOS>
Green

he

if

back
to

,
in

it

evident
to

consider
these

some

"
<EOS>
Rawdon
acquiesce
in
the
justice
of

opinion
;

in
truth
he
have
remark
that
after
a

of
his

in

themselves
very
eagerly

<EOS>
easy

pleasant
as
their

it
be
after
all
only
an
idle
dalliance

Rebecca
see
that
she
must
push
Rawdon
's
fortune
in
their
own
country

<EOS>
She
must
get
him

she
determine
to
make
a
move
upon

at
his

at
his
false
tooth

at
his
pretension
to
be
a
lady

and
his
absurd
vanity
in
fancy
every
woman
whom
he
come
near

<EOS>
It
be

but
,
as
we
have

she
be
grow
tired

this
idle
social
life

nosegay

the
Colonel
must

<EOS>
Mrs.

He

it

take
the
diligence
to
Dunkirk
,
and
thence
travel
to
Brussels
,
for
which
place
he
have
a
former
predilection
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
he
owe
more
money
at
London
than
at
Paris
;
and
he
prefer
the
quiet
little
belgian
city
to
either
of
the
more
noisy
capital

Her

They

<EOS>
Mrs.
Crawley
and
the
landlord

consultation

an
amicable

about

She

They

They
be
not
,
however
,
find
to
be
particularly
valuable
when
open
some
time
after

<EOS>
but
before
she
go
to
join
her
husband
in
the
belgic
capital
,
Mrs.
Crawley
make
an
expedition
into
England
,
leave
behind
her
her
little
son
upon
the
continent
,
under
the
care
of
her
french
maid
.
  
<EOS>
the
parting
between
Rebecca
and
the
little
Rawdon
do
not
cause
either
party
much
pain
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
not
,
to
say
truth
,
see
much
of
the
young
gentleman
since
his
birth
.
<EOS>
after
the
amiable
fashion
of
french
mother
,
she
have
place
him
out
at
nurse
in
a
village
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Paris
,
where
little
Rawdon
pass
the
first
month
of
his
life
,
not
unhappily
,
with
a
numerous
family
of
foster
-
brother
in
wooden
shoe
.
<EOS>
His
father
would
ride
over
many
a
time
to
see
him
here
,
and
the
eld
Rawdon
's
paternal
heart
glow
to
see
him
rosy
and
dirty
,
shout
lustily
,
and
happy
in
the
making
of
mud
-
pie
under
the
superintendence
of
the
gardener
's
wife
,
his
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
Rebecca
do
not
care
much
to
go
and
see
the
son
and
heir
.
 
<EOS>
once
he
spoil
a
new
dove
-
colour
pelisse
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
prefer
his
nurse
's
caress
to
his
mamma
's
,
and
when
finally
he
quit
that
jolly
nurse
and
almost
parent
,
he
cry
loudly
for
hour
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
only
console
by
his
mother
's
promise
that
he
should
return
to
his
nurse
the
next
day
;
indeed
the
nurse
herself
,
who
probably
would
have
be
pain
at
the
parting
too
,
be
tell
that
the
child
would
immediately
be
restore
to
her
,
and
for
some
time
await
quite
anxiously
his
return
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
our
friend
may
be
say
to
have
be
among
the
first
of
that
brood
of
hardy
english
adventurer
who
have
subsequently
invade
the
Continent
and
swindle
in
all
the

of
Europe

<EOS>
the
respect

happy

be
very
great
for
the
wealth
and
honour
of
Britons

<EOS>
They

not
then
learn
,
as
I
be
tell
,
to
haggle
for
bargain
with
the
pertinacity
which
now
distinguish
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
city
of
Europe
have
not
be
as
yet
open
to
the
enterprise
of
our
rascal

<EOS>
and
whereas
there
be
now
hardly
a
town
of
France
or
Italy
in
which
you
shall
not
see
some
noble
countryman
of
our

with
that
happy
swagger

insolence
of

which
we

<EOS>
It
be
not

some
week
after
the
Crawleys

departure
that
the
landlord
of

hotel
which
they
occupy
during

It

<EOS>
Mrs.

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
and
so

Colonel

Mrs.
Crawley
come
to
London
:
and
it
be
at
their
house
in
Curzon
Street
,
May
Fair
,
that
they
really
show
the
skill
which
must
be
possess
by
those
who
would

resource
above

<EOS>
the
subject
continue
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
and
as
a
matter
of
the
great
necessity

we
be
bind
to
describe
how
a
house
may
be
get
for
nothing
a
year

<EOS>
these
mansion
be

where
,
if
you

Gillows

you
can
get

splendidly
montee
and
decorate
entirely

or
they
be
to
be
let
furnish
,
a
less
troublesome
and
complicated
arrangement
to
most
party
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
that
Crawley
and
his
wife
prefer
to
hire
their
house
.
  
<EOS>
before
Mr.
Bowls
come
to

over
Miss

estate
of
Queen

Crawley

and
indeed
be
a
young
son
of
a
gardener

<EOS>
by
good
conduct

a
handsome
person

and
a
grave
demeanour
,
Raggles
rise
from

board
to
the
footboard
of

from

<EOS>

where
he

good

who
have

manner
by
the
exercise
of
a
mangle
,
and
the
keeping
of
a
small
greengrocer
's
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
the
ceremony
have
be
clandestinely
perform
some
year
back
;
although
the
news
of
Mr.
Raggles
'
marriage
be
first

Miss

whose
continual
presence
in

<EOS>
Mr.

and
have
a

<EOS>
a
part

the
money
he
borrow
,
it
be
true
,
and
at
rather
a
high
interest
,
from
a
brother
butler
,
but
the
chief
part
he
pay
down
,
and
it
be
with
no
small
pride
that
Mrs.
Raggles
find
herself
sleep
in
a
bed
of
carve
mahogany
,
with
silk
curtain
,
with
a
prodigious
cheval
glass
opposite
to
her

and
a
wardrobe
which
would
contain
her
,
and
Raggles
,
and
all
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
they
do
not
intend
to
occupy
permanently
an
apartment
so
splendid
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
order
to
let
the
house
again
that
Raggles
purchase
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
a
tenant
be
find
,
he
subside
into
the
greengrocer
's
shop
once
more
;
but
a
happy
thing
it
be
for
him
to
walk
out
of
that
tenement
and
into
Curzon
Street
,
and
there
survey
his
house
 
<EOS>
his
own
house
 
with
geranium
in
the
window
and
a
carve
bronze
knocker
.
 
<EOS>
the
footman
occasionally
lounge
at
the
area
rail
,
treat
him
with
respect
;
the
cook
take
her
green
stuff
at
his
house
and
call
him
Mr.
Landlord
,
and
there
be
not
one
thing
the
tenant
do
,
or
one
dish
which
they
have
for
dinner
,
that
Raggles
may
not
know
of
,
if
he
like
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
man
;
good
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
bring
him
in
so
handsome
a
yearly
income
that
he
be
determined
to
send
his
child
to
good
school
,
and
accordingly
,
regardless
of
expense
,
Charles
be
send
to
boarding
at
Dr.
Swishtail

,
Sugar

cane
Lodge
,
and
little
Matilda
to
Miss
Peckover

Laurentinum
House

<EOS>
Raggles
love
and
adore
the
Crawley
family
as
the
author
of
all
his
prosperity
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
silhouette
of
his
mistress
in
his
back
shop
,
and
a
drawing
of
the
Porter
's
Lodge
at
Queen
's
Crawley
,
do
by
that
spinster
herself
in
India
ink
 
and
the
only
addition
he
make
to
the
decoration
of
the
Curzon
Street
House
be
a
print
of
Queen
's
Crawley
in
Hampshire
,
the
seat
of
Sir
Walpole
Crawley
,
Baronet
,
who
be
represent
in
a
gild
car
draw
by
six
white
horse
,
and
pass
by
a
lake
cover
with
swans
,
and
barge
contain
lady
in
hoop
,
and
musician
with
flag
and
penwig
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
Raggles
think
there
be
no
such
palace
in
all
the
world
,
and
no
such
august
family
.
  
<EOS>
as
luck
would
have
it
,
Raggles
'
house
in
Curzon
Street
be
to
let
when
Rawdon
and
his
wife
return
to
London
.
<EOS>
the
Colonel
know
it
and
its
owner
quite
well
;
the
latter
's
connection
with
the
Crawley
family
have
be
keep
up
constantly
,
for
Raggles
help
Mr.
Bowls
whenever
Miss
Crawley
receive
friend
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
old
man
not
only
let
his
house
to
the
Colonel
but
officiate
as
his
butler
whenever
he
have
company
;
Mrs.
Raggles
operate
in
the
kitchen
below
and
send
up
dinner
of
which
<EOS>
old
Miss
Crawley
herself
may
have
approve
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
way
,
then
,
Crawley
get
his
house
for
nothing
;
for
though
Raggles
have
to
pay
taxis
and
rate
,
and
the
interest
of
the
mortgage
to
the
brother
butler
;
and
the
insurance
of
his
life
;
and
the
charge
for
his
child
at
school
;
and
the
value
of
the
meat
and
drink
which
his
own
family
 
and
for
a
time
that
of
Colonel
Crawley
too
 
consume
;
and
though
the
poor
wretch
be
utterly
ruin
by
the
transaction
,
his
child
be
fling
on
the
street
,
and
himself
drive
into
the
Fleet
Prison
:
 
<EOS>
yet
somebody
must
pay
even
for
gentleman
who
live
for
nothing
a
year
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
this
<EOS>
unlucky
Raggles
be
make
the
representative
of
Colonel
Crawley
's
defective
capital
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
many
family
be
drive
to
roguery
and
to
ruin
by
great
practitioner
in
Crawlers
way
?
 
<EOS>
how
many
great
nobleman
rob
their
petty
tradesman
,
condescend
to
swindle
their
poor
retainer
out
of
wretched
little
sum
and
cheat
for
a
few
shilling
?
<EOS>
when
we
read
that
a
noble
nobleman
have
leave
for
the
continent
,
or
that
another
noble
nobleman
have
an
execution
in
his
house
 
and
that
one
or
other
owe
six
or
seven
million
,
the
defeat
seem
glorious
even
,
and
we
respect
the
victim
in
the
vastness
of
his
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
but
who
pity
a
poor
barber
who
can
not
get
his
money
for
powder
the
footman
's
head
;
or
a
poor
carpenter
who
have
ruin
himself
by
fix
up
ornament
and
pavilion
for
my
lady
's
dejeuner
;
or
the
poor
devil
of
a
tailor
whom
the
steward
patronize
,
and
who
have
pledge
all
he
be
worth
,
and
more
,
to
get
the
livery
ready
,
which
my
lord
have
do
him
the
honour
to
bespeak
?
<EOS>
when
the
great
house
tumble
down
,
these
miserable
wretch
fall
under
it
unnoticed
:
as
they
say
in
the
old
legend
,
before
a
man
go
to
the
devil
himself
,
he
send
plenty
of
other
soul
thither
.
  
<EOS>
Rawdon
and
his
wife
generously
give
their
patronage
to
all
such
of
Miss
Crawley
's
tradesman
and
purveyor
as
choose
to
serve
them
.
 
<EOS>
some
be
willing
enough
,
especially
the
poor
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
to
see
the
pertinacity
with
which
the
washerwoman
from
Tooting
bring
the
cart
every
Saturday
,
and
her
bill
week
after
week
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Raggles
himself
have
to
supply
the
greengrocery
.
 
<EOS>
the
bill
for
servant
'
porter
at
the
Fortune
of
War
public
house
be
a
curiosity
in
the
chronicle
of
beer
.
<EOS>
every
servant
also
be
owe
the
great
part
of
his
wage
,
and
thus
keep
up
perforce
an
interest
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
nobody
in
fact
be
pay
.
<EOS>
not
the
blacksmith
who
open
the
lock
;
nor
the
glazier
who
mend
the
pane
;
nor
the
jobber
who
let
the
carriage
;
nor
the
groom
who
drive
it
;
nor
the
butcher
who
provide
the
leg
of
mutton
;
nor
the
coal
which
roast
it
;
nor
the
cook
who
baste
it
;
nor
the
servant
who
eat
it
:
and
this
I
be
give
to
understand
be
not
unfrequently
the
way
in
which
people
live
elegantly
on
nothing
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
little
town
such
thing
can
not
be
do
without
remark
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
there
the
quantity
of
milk
our
neighbour
take
and
espy
the
joint
or
the
fowl
which
be
go
in
for
his
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
probably
,
200
and
202
in
Curzon
Street
may
know
what
be
go
on
in
the
house
between
them
,
the
servant
communicate
through
the
area
-
railing
;
but
Crawley
and
his
wife
and
his
friend
do
not
know
200
and
202
.
<EOS>
when
you
come
to
201
there
be
a
hearty
welcome
,
a
kind
smile
,
a
good
dinner
,
and
a
jolly
shake
of
the
hand
from
the
host
and
hostess
there
,
just
for
all
the
world
as
if
they
have
be
undisputed
master
of
three
or
four
thousand
a
year
 
<EOS>
and
so
they
be
,
not
in
money
,
but
in
produce
and
labour
 
<EOS>
if
they
do
not
pay
for
the
mutton
,
they
have
it
:
 
if
they
do
not
give
bullion
in
exchange
for
their
wine
<EOS>
,
how
should
we
know
?
<EOS>
never
be
well
claret
at
any
man
's
table
than
at
honest
Rawdon
's
;
dinner
more
gay
and
neatly
serve
.
  
<EOS>
His
drawing

room
be
the
prettiest

little

modest
salon
conceivable

they
be
decorate
with
the
great
taste

and
a

knack

when

You

It

and
how

as

(
such

who
cut
a

surround

Mrs.

the

the

be
matter
of
wonder
to
those

cut

It
be
curious

no

not

a

<EOS>
to

out

require
a
severer

when

a

be
there
any

Collector

Boggley
Wollah

<EOS>
the
fact

the

be
briefly
these
:
  
<EOS>
Our
worthy
fat
friend
Joseph
Sedley
return
to
India
not
long
after
his
escape
from
Brussels
.
 
<EOS>
either
his
furlough
be
up
,
or
he
dread
to
meet
any
witness
of
his
Waterloo
flight
.
 
<EOS>
however
it
may
be
,
he
go
back
to
his
duty
in
Bengal
very
soon
after
Napoleon
have
take
up
his
residence
at
St.
 
Helena
,
where
Jos
see
the
ex
-
Emperor
.
<EOS>
to
hear
Mr.
Sedley
talk
on
board
ship
you
would
have
suppose
that
it
be
not
the
first
time
he
and
the
Corsican
have
meet
,
and
that
the
civilian
have
beard
the
French
General
at
Mount
St.
 
John
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
thousand
anecdote
about
the
famous
battle
;
he
know
the
position
of
every
regiment
and
the
loss
which
each
have
incur
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
deny
that
he
have
be
concern
in
those
victory
 
that
he
have
be
with
the
army
and
carry
despatch
for
the
Duke
of
Wellington
.
<EOS>
and
he
describe
what
the
Duke
do
and
say
on
every
conceivable
moment
of
the
day
of
Waterloo
,
with
such
an
accurate
knowledge
of
his
grace
's
sentiment
and
proceeding
that
it
be
clear
he
must
have
be
by
the
conqueror
's
side
throughout
the
day
;
though
,
as
a
non
-
combatant
,
his
name
be
not
mention
in
the
public
document
relative
to
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
actually
work
himself
up
to
believe
that
he
have
be
engage
with
the
army
;
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
he
make
a
prodigious
sensation
for
some
time
at
Calcutta
,
and
be
call
Waterloo
Sedley
during
the
whole
of
his
subsequent
stay
in
Bengal
.
  
<EOS>
the
bill
which
Jos
have
give
for
the
purchase
of
those
unlucky
horse
be
pay
without
question
by
him
and
his
agent
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
be
hear
to
allude

and
nobody
know
for
a
certainty
what
become
of
the
horse
,
or
how
he
get
rid
of
them
,
or
of
Isidor
,
his
belgian
servant
,
who
sell
a
grey
horse
,
very
like
the
one
which
Jos
ride
,
at
Valenciennes
sometime
during
the
autumn
of
1815
.
  
<EOS>
Jos
's
London
agent
have
order
to
pay
one
hundred
and
twenty
pound
yearly
to
his
parent
at
Fulham
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
chief
support
of
the
old
couple
;
for
Mr.
Sedley
's
speculation
in
life
subsequent
to
his
bankruptcy
do
not
by
any
mean
retrieve
the
broken
old

's

He

order
a
new
brass
plate
for
the

talk
pompously
about

Fortune
never

drop
off

be
weary
of
buy
dear
coal

bad
wine
from
him

there
be
only
his
wife
in
all
the

who
fancy
,
when
he
totter
off
to
the
City
of

<EOS>
at
evening
he
crawl
slowly
back

use
to
go

night
to
a
little
club
at
a
tavern
,
where
he
dispose
of
the
finance
of

It
be
wonderful
to
hear
him

and
what
Rothschild

<EOS>
between
Mrs.
Sedley
and
her
daughter
there
be
a
sort
of
coolness
about
this
boy
,
and
a
secret
jealousy
 
for
one
evening
in
George
's
very
early
day
,
Amelia
,
who
have
be
seat
at
work
in
their
little
parlour
scarcely
remark
that
the
old
lady
have
quit
the
room
,
run
upstairs
instinctively
to
the
nursery
at
the
cry
of
the
child
,
who
have
be
asleep
until
that
moment
 
and
there
find
Mrs.
Sedley
in
the
act
of
surreptitiously
administer
Daffy
's
Elixir
to
the
infant

<EOS>
Amelia
,
the
gentle
and
sweetest
of
everyday
mortal
,
when
she
find
this
meddling
with
her
maternal
authority
,
thrill
and
tremble
all
over
with
anger
.
 
<EOS>
Her
cheek
,
ordinarily
pale
,
now
flush
up
,
until
they
be
as
red
as
they
use
to
be
when
she
be
a
child
of
twelve
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
She
seize
the
baby
out
of
her
mother
's
arm
and
then
grasp
at
the
bottle
,
leave
the
old
lady
gape
at
her
,
furious
,
and
hold
the
guilty
tea
-
spoon
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
fling
the
bottle
crash
into
the
fire

place
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
baby
poison

Mamma

cry
Emmy
,
rock
the
infant
about
violently
with
both
her
arm
round
him
and
turn
with
flash
eye
at
her
mother

<EOS>
"

the

reply
Mrs.

<EOS>
"
this

I

oh

no

my

<EOS>
only

I

in

I

better

Old
Bailey

<EOS>
though
I
do
not

when
you

but
give
you
the

<EOS>
yes

I
have
nurse
five
child

bury

and
the
one
I
love
the
good
of

and
measle

and
hooping

cough

and
bring
up
with
foreign
master

regardless
of
expense
,
and
with
accomplishment
at
Minerva
House
 
which
I
never
have
when
I
be
a
girl
 
when
I
be
too
glad
to
honour
my
father
and
mother
,
that
I
may
live
long
in
the
land
,
and
to
be
useful

and
not

mope
all

in
my

the
fine

<EOS>
ah
,
Mrs.
Osborne

<EOS>
may
you
never

be
my
prayer

"
Mamma

Mamma

cry
the

and
the
child
in

set
up
a
frantic
chorus
of
shout
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
murderess
,
indeed

<EOS>
go
down
on
your

and
pray
to
God
to
cleanse
your
wicked
ungrateful
heart

Amelia

and
may
He
forgive
you
as
I
do

"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Sedley
toss
out
of
the
room
,
hiss
out
the
word
poison
once
more
,
and
so
end
her
charitable
benediction
.
  
<EOS>
till
the
termination
of
her
natural
life
,
this
breach
between
Mrs.
Sedley
and
her
daughter
be
never
thoroughly
mend
.
 
<EOS>
the
quarrel
give
the
eld
lady
numberless
advantage
which
she
do
not
fail
to
turn
to
account
with
female
ingenuity
and
perseverance
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
she
scarcely
speak
to
Amelia
for
many
week
afterwards
.
<EOS>
She
warn
the
domestic
not
to
touch
the
child
,
as
Mrs.
Osborne
may
be
offend
.
<EOS>
She
ask
her
daughter
to
see
and
satisfy
herself
that
there
be
no
poison
prepared
in
the
little
daily
mess
that
be
concoct
for
Georgy
.
<EOS>
when
neighbour
ask
after
the
boy
's
health
,
she
refer
them
pointedly
to
Mrs.
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
she
never
venture
to
ask
whether
the
baby
be
well
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
she
would
not
touch
the
child
although
he
be
her
grandson
,
and
own
precious
darling
,
for
she
be
not
use
to
child
,
and
may
kill
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
whenever
Mr.
Pestler
come
upon
his
healing
inquisition
,
she
receive
the
doctor
with
such
a
sarcastic
and
scornful
demeanour
,
as
make
the
surgeon
declare
that
not
Lady
Thistlewood
herself
,
whom
he
have
the
honour
of
attend
professionally
,
could
give
herself
great
air
than
old
Mrs.
Sedley
,
from
whom
he
never
take
a
fee
.
 
<EOS>
and
very
likely
Emmy
be
jealous
too
,
upon
her
own
part
,
as
what
mother
be
not
,
of
those
who
would
manage
her
child
for
her
,
or
become
candidate
for
the
first
place
in
their
affection
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
when
anybody
nurse
the
child
,
she
be
uneasy
,
and
that
she
would
no
more
allow
Mrs.
Clapp
or
the
domestic
to
dress
or
tend
him
than
she
would
have
let
them
wash
her
husband
's
miniature
which
hang
up
over
her
little
bed
 
the
same
little
bed
from
which
the
poor
girl
have
go
to
his
;
and
to
which
she
retire
now
for
many
long
,
silent
,
tearful
,
but
happy
year
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
room
be
all
Amelia
's
heart
and
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
here
it
be
that
she
tend
her
boy
and
watch
him
through
the
many
ill
of
childhood
,
with
a
constant
passion
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
the
eld
George
return
in
him
somehow
,
only
improve
,
and
as
if
come
back
from
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
hundred
little
tone
,
look
,
and
movement
,
the
child
be
so
like
his
father
that
the
widow
's
heart
thrill
as
she
hold
him
to
it
;
and
he
would
often
ask
the
cause
of
her
tear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
because
of
his
likeness
to
his
father
,
she
do
not
scruple
to
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
talk
constantly
to
him
about
this
dead
father
,
and
speak
of
her
love
for
George
to
the
innocent
and
wonder
child
;
much
more
than
she
ever
have
do
to
George
himself
,
or
to
any
confidante
of
her
youth
.
 
<EOS>
to
her
parent
she
never
talk
about
this
matter
,
shrink
from
bare
her
heart
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Little
George
very
likely
could
understand
no
well
than
they
,
but
into
his
ear
she
pour
her
sentimental
secret
unreservedly
,
and
into
his
only
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
joy
of
this
woman
be
a
sort
of
grief
,
or
so
tender
,
at
least
,
that
its
expression
be
tear
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sensibility
be
so
weak
and
tremulous
that
perhaps
they
ought
not
to
be
talk
about
in
a
book
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
by
Dr.
Pestler
(
now
a
most
flourish
lady
's
physician
,
with
a
sumptuous
dark
green
carriage
,
a
prospect
of
speedy
knighthood
,
and
a
house
in
Manchester
Square
)
that
her
grief
at
wean
the
child
be
a
sight
that
would
have
unman
a
Herod
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
soft
-
hearted
many
year
ago
,
and
his
wife
be
mortally
jealous
of
Mrs.
Amelia
,
then
and
long
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
doctor
's
lady
have
good
reason
for
her
jealousy
:
 
most
woman
share
it
,
of
those
who
form
the
small
circle
of
Amelia
's
acquaintance
,
and
be
quite
angry
at
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
other
sex
regard
her
.
 
<EOS>
for
almost
all
man
who
come
near
her
love
her
;
<EOS>
though
no
doubt
they
would
be
at
a
loss
to
tell
you
why
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
brilliant
,
nor
witty
,
nor
wise
over
much
,
nor
extraordinarily
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
but
wherever
she
go
she
touch
and
charm
every
one
of
the
male
sex
,
as
invariably
as
she
awaken
the
scorn
and
incredulity
of
her
own
sisterhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
her
weakness
which
be
her
principal
charm
 
<EOS>
a
kind
of
sweet
submission
and
softness
,
which
seem
to
appeal
to
each
man
she
meet
for
his
sympathy
and
protection
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
see
how
in
the
regiment
,
though
she
speak
<EOS>
but
to
few
of
George
's
comrade
there
,
all
the
sword
of
the
young
fellow
at
the
mess
-
table
would
have
leapt
from
their
scabbard
to
fight
round
her
;
and
so
it
be
in
the
little
narrow
lodging
-
house
and
circle
at
Fulham
,
she
interest
and
please
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
Mrs.
Mango
herself
,
of
the
great
house
of
Mango
,
Plantain
,
and
Co.
,
Crutched
Friars
,
and
the
magnificent
proprietress
of
the
Pineries
,
Fulham
,
who
give
summer
dejeuner
frequent
by
Dukes
and
Earls
,
and
drive
about
the
parish
with
magnificent
yellow
livery
and
bay
horse
,
such
as
the
royal
stable
at
Kensington
themselves
could
not
turn
out
 
I
say
have
she
be
Mrs.
Mango
herself
,
or
<EOS>
her
son
's
wife
,
Lady
Mary
Mango
(
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Castlemouldy
,
who
condescend
to
marry
the
head
of
the
firm
)
,
the
tradesman
of
the
neighbourhood
could
not
pay
her
more
honour
than
they
invariably
show
to
the
gentle
young
widow
,
when
she
pass
by
their
door
,
or
make
her
humble
purchase
at
their
shop
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
be
not
only
Mr.
Pestler
,
the
medical
man
,
but
Mr.
Linton
the
young
assistant
,
who
doctor
the
servant
maid
and
small
tradesman
,
and
may
be
see
any
day
read
the
Times
in
the
surgery
,
who
openly
declare
himself
the
slave
of
Mrs.
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
personable
young
gentleman
,
more
welcome
at
Mrs.
Sedley
's
lodging
than
his
principal
;
and
if
anything
go
wrong
with
Georgy
,
he
would
drop
in
twice
or
thrice
in
the
day
to
see
the
little
chap
,
and
without
so
much
as
the
thought
of
a
fee
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
abstract
lozenge
,
tamarind
,
and
other
produce
from
the
surgery
-
drawer
for
little
Georgy
's
benefit
,
and
compound
draught
and
mixture
for
him
of
miraculous
sweetness
,
so
that
it
be
quite
a
pleasure
to
the
child
to
be
ail
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Pestler
,
his
chief
,
sit
up
two
whole
night
by
the
boy
in
that
momentous
and
awful
week
when
Georgy
have
the
measle
;
and
when
you
would
have
think
,
from
the
mother
's
terror
,
that
there
have
never
be
measle
in
the
world
before
.
<EOS>
Would
they
have
do
as
much
for
other
people
?
<EOS>
do
they
sit
up
for
the
folk
at
the
Pineries
,
when
Ralph
Plantagenet
,
and
Gwendoline
,
and
Guinever
Mango
have
the
same
juvenile
complaint
?
<EOS>
do
they
sit
up
for
little
Mary
Clapp
,
the
landlord
's
daughter
,
who
actually
catch
the
disease
of
little
Georgy
?
<EOS>
truth
compel
one
to
say
,
no
.
<EOS>
They
sleep
quite
undisturbed
,
at
least
as
far
as
she
be
concern
 
pronounce
her
to
be
a
slight
case
,
which
would
almost
cure
itself
,
send
her
in
a
draught
or
two
,
and
throw
in
bark
when
the
child
rally
,
with
perfect
indifference
,
and
just
for
form
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
there
be
the
little
french
chevalier
opposite
,
who
give
lesson
in
his
native
tongue
at
various
school
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
who
may
be
hear
in
his
apartment
of
night
play
tremulous
old
gavotte
and
minuet
on
a
wheezy
old
fiddle
.
<EOS>
whenever
this
powdered
and
courteous
old
man
,
who
never
miss
a
Sunday
at
the
convent
chapel
at
Hammersmith
,
and
who
be
in
all
respect
,
thought
,
conduct
,
and
bear
utterly
unlike
the
bearded
savage
of
his
nation
,
who
curse
perfidious
Albion
,
and
scowl
at
you
from
over
their
cigar
,
in
the
Quadrant
arcade
at
the
present
day
 
whenever
the
old
Chevalier
de
Talonrouge
speak
of
Mistress
Osborne
,
he
would
first
finish
his
pinch
of
snuff
,
flick
away
the
remain
particle
of
dust
with
a
graceful
wave
of
his
hand
,
gather
up
his
finger
again
into
a
bunch
,
and
,
bring
them
up
to
his
mouth
,
blow
them
open
with
a
kiss
,
exclaim
,
ah

<EOS>
la
divine
creature

<EOS>
He
vow
and
protest
that
when
Amelia
walk
in
the
Brompton
Lanes
flower
grow
in
profusion
under
her
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
call
little
Georgy
Cupid
,
and
ask
him
news
of
Venus
,
his
mamma
;
and
tell
the
astonished
Betty
Flanagan
that
she
be
one
of
the
Graces
,
and
the
favourite
attendant
of
the
Reine
des
Amours

<EOS>
instance
may
be
multiply
of
this
easily
gain

unconscious
popularity

<EOS>
do
not
Mr.
Binny

the
mild
and
genteel
curate
of
the
district
chapel
,
which
the
family
attend
,
call
assiduously
upon
the
widow
,
dandle
the
little
boy
on
his

and
offer
to
teach
him
Latin
,
to
the
anger
of
the
elderly
virgin

his
sister

who
keep
house
for
him

<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing

Beilby

the
latter

would
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
she
come
to
tea
here
she
do
not
speak
a

during
the
whole
evening

<EOS>
She
be

a

lackadaisical
creature

it
be
my

have
no

<EOS>
It

her
pretty

a

we

what
folly
will
not
a

make
pardonable

what
dulness

Mr.

that
all

<EOS>
Dobbin

blush

awkwardness
add
to
the

conviction
that
he
have
a

he
tell

Dobbin

see
Master

Mr.

He

have
the
honour
of
make
for
the
Captain
,
the
young
gentleman
's
father
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
too
,
and
by
the
Major
's
desire
no
doubt
,
his
sister
,
the
Misses
Dobbin
,
would
call
in
the
family
carriage
to
take
Amelia
and
the
little
boy
to
drive
if
they
be
so
inclined
.
 
<EOS>
the
patronage
and
kindness
of
these
lady
be
very
uncomfortable
to
Amelia
,
but
she
bear
it
meekly
enough
,
for
her
nature
be
to
yield
;
and
,
besides
,
the
carriage
and
its
splendour
give
little
Georgy
immense
pleasure
.
<EOS>
the
lady
beg
occasionally
that
the
child
may
pass
a
day
with
them
,
and
he
be
always
glad
to
go
to
that
fine
garden

house
at
Denmark
Hill
,
where
they
live
,
and
where
there
be
such
fine
grape
in
the
hot

house
and
peach
on
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
they
kindly
come
over
to
Amelia
with
news
which
they
be
SURE
would
delight
her
 
something
very
interesting
about
their
dear
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
:
 
<EOS>
be
he
come
home
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
with
pleasure
beam
in
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
 
not
the
least
 
<EOS>
but
they
have
very
good
reason
to
believe
that
dear
William
be
about
to
be
marry
 
and
to
a
relation
of
a
very
dear
friend
of
Amelia
's
 
to
Miss
Glorvina
O'Dowd
,
Sir
Michael
O'Dowd
's
sister
,
who
have
go
out
to
join
Lady
O'Dowd
at
Madras
 
a
very
beautiful
and
accomplished
girl
,
everybody
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
Amelia
say
"
oh
!
"
<EOS>
Amelia
be
very
very
happy
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
she
suppose
Glorvina
could
not
be
like
her
old
acquaintance
,
who
be
most
kind
 
<EOS>
but
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
very
happy
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
and
by
some
impulse
of
which
I
can
not
explain
the
meaning
,
she
take
George
in
her
arm
and
kiss
him
with
an
extraordinary
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
quite
moist
when
she
put
the
child
down
;
and
she
scarcely
speak
a
word
during
the
whole
of
the
drive
 
though
she
be
so
very
happy
indeed

a
Cynical
chapter
 
<EOS>
Our
duty
now
take
us
back
for
a
brief
space
to
some
old
Hampshire
acquaintance
of
our
,
whose
hope
respect
the
disposal
of
their
rich
kinswoman
's
property
be
so
woefully
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
after
count
upon
thirty
thousand
pound
from
his
sister
,
it
be
a
heavy
blow
to
Bute
Crawley
to
receive
but
five
;
<EOS>
out
of
which
sum
,
when
he
have
pay
his
own
debt
and
those
of
Jim
,
his
son
at
college
,
a
very
small
fragment
remain
to
portion
off
his
four
plain
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
never
know
,
or
at
least
never
acknowledge
,
how
far
her
own
tyrannous
behaviour
have
tend
to
ruin
her
husband
.
<EOS>
all
that
woman
could
do
,
she
vow
and
protest
she
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
her
fault
if
she
do
not
possess
those
sycophantic
art
which
her
hypocritical
nephew
,
Pitt
Crawley
,
practise
?
<EOS>
She
wish
him
all
the
happiness
which
he
merit
out
of
his
ill
-
get
gain
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
least
the
money
will
remain
in
the
family
,
"
she
say
charitably
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pitt
will
never
spend
it
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
that
be
quite
certain
;
for
a
great
miser
do
not
exist
in
England
,
and
he
be
as
odious
,
though
in
a
different
way
,
as
his
spendthrift
brother
,
the
abandon
Rawdon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Mrs.
Bute
,
after
the
first
shock
of
rage
and
disappointment
,
begin
to
accommodate
herself
as
best
she
could
to
her
altered
fortune
and
to
save
and
retrench
with
all
her
might
.
 
<EOS>
She
instruct
her
daughter
how
to
bear
poverty
cheerfully
,
and
invent
a
thousand
notable
method
to
conceal
or
evade
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
them
about
to
ball
and
public
place
in
the
neighbourhood
,
with
praiseworthy
energy
;
nay
,
she
entertain
her
friend
in
a
hospitable
comfortable
manner
at
the
Rectory
,
and
much
more
frequently
than
before
dear
Miss
Crawley
's
legacy
have
fall
in
.
<EOS>
from
her
outward
bear
nobody
would
have
suppose
that
the
family
have
be
disappoint
in
their
expectation
,
or
have
guess
from
her
frequent
appearance
in
public
how
she
pinch
and
starve
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Her
girl
have
more
milliner
'
furniture
than
they
have
ever
enjoy
before
.
<EOS>
They
appear
perseveringly
at
the
Winchester
and
Southampton
assembly
;
they
penetrate
to
Cowes
for
the
race
-
ball
and
regatta
-
gaiety
there
;
and
their
carriage
,
with
the
horse
take
from
the
plough
,
be
at
work
perpetually
,
until
it
begin
almost
to
be
believe
that
the
four
sister
have
have
fortune
leave
them
by
their
aunt
,
whose
name
the
family
never
mention
in
public
but
with
the
most
tender
gratitude
and
regard
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
sort
of
lying
which
be
more
frequent
in
Vanity
Fair
than
this
,
and
it
may
be
remark
how
people
who
practise
it
take
credit
to
themselves
for
their
hypocrisy
,
and
fancy
that
they
be
exceedingly
virtuous
and
praiseworthy
,
because
they
be
able
to
deceive
the
world
with
regard
to
the
extent
of
their
mean
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
certainly
think
herself
one
of
the
most
virtuous
woman
in
England
,
and
the
sight
of
her
happy
family
be
an
edifying
one
to
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
so
cheerful
,
so

<EOS>
in

between

it

the

He

<EOS>
horrock

some
wild
effort

but
Mrs.

and
bade
him

or

and
henceforth
may

<EOS>
for
though
the
old
Baronet
survive
many
month
,
he
never
recover
the
use
of
his
intellect
or
his
speech
completely
,
and
the
government
of
the
estate
devolve
upon
his
eld
son

<EOS>
in
a
strange
condition
Pitt
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir

be
always
buy

mortgaging
;
he
have
twenty
man
of

and
quarrel

quarrel

and
lawsuit
with

lawsuit
with

;
lawsuit
with
the
Mining
and
Dock
Companies
in
which
he
be
proprietor
;
and
with
every
person
with
whom
he
have
business
.
 
<EOS>
to
unravel
these
difficulty
and
to
set
the
estate
clear
be
a
task
worthy
of
the
orderly
and
persevere
diplomatist
of
Pumpernickel
,
and
he
set
himself
to
work
with
prodigious
assiduity
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
family
,
of
course
,
be
transport
to
Queen
's
Crawley
,
whither
Lady
Southdown
,
of
course
,
come
too
;
and
she
set
about
convert
the
parish
under
the
rector
's
nose
,
and
bring
down
her
irregular
clergy
to
the
dismay
of
the
angry
Mrs
Bute
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
have
conclude
no
bargain
for
the
sale
of
the
living
of
Queen
's
Crawley
;
when
it
should
drop
,
her
Ladyship
propose
to
take
the
patronage
into
her
own
hand
and
present
a
young
protege
to
the
Rectory
,
on
which
subject
the
diplomatic
Pitt
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
's
intention
with
regard
to
Miss
Betsy
Horrocks
be
not
carry
into
effect
,
and
she
pay
no
visit
to
Southampton
Gaol
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
father
leave
the
Hall
when
the
latter
take
possession
of
the
Crawley
Arms
in
the
village
,
of
which
he
have
get
a
lease
from
Sir
Pitt
.
<EOS>
the
ex
-
butler
have
obtain
a
small
freehold
there
likewise
,
which
give
him
a
vote
for
the
borough
.
 
<EOS>
the
Rector
have
another
of
these
vote
,
and
these
and
four
other
form
the
representative
body
which
return
the
two
member
for
Queen
's
Crawley
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
show
of
courtesy
keep
up
between
the
Rectory
and
the
Hall
lady
,
between
the
young
one
at
least
,
for
Mrs.
Bute
and
Lady
Southdown
never
could
meet
without
battle
,
and
gradually
cease
see
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
keep
her
room
when
the
lady
from
the
Rectory
visit
their
cousin
at
the
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
Mr.
Pitt
be
not
very
much
displeased
at
these
occasional
absence
of
his
mamma
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
He
believe
the
Binkie
family
to
be
the
great
and
wise
and
most
interesting
in
the
world
,
and
her
Ladyship
and
his
aunt
have
long
hold
ascendency
over
him
;
but
sometimes
he
feel
that
she
command
him
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
consider
young
be
complimentary
,
doubtless
,
but
at
six
-
and
-
forty
to
be
treat
as
a
boy
be
sometimes
mortify
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jane
yield
up
everything
,
however
,
to
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
only
fond
of
her
child
in
private
,
and
it
be
lucky
for
her
that
Lady
Southdown
's
multifarious
business
,
her
conference
with
minister
,
and
her
correspondence
with
all
the
missionary
of
Africa
,
Asia
,
and
Australasia
,
&
c.
,
occupy
the
venerable
Countess
a
great
deal
,
so
that
she
have
but
<EOS>
little
time
to
devote
to
her
granddaughter
,
the
little
Matilda
,
and
her
grandson
,
Master
Pitt
Crawley
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
a
feeble
child
,
and
it
be
only
by
prodigious
quantity
of
calomel
that
Lady
Southdown
be
able
to
keep
him
in
life
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Sir
Pitt
he
retire
into
those
very
apartment
where
Lady
Crawley
have
be
previously
extinguish
,
and
here
be
tend
by
Miss
Hester
,
the
girl
upon
her
promotion
,
with
constant
care
and
assiduity
.
<EOS>
what
love
,
what
fidelity
,
what
constancy
be
there
equal
to
that
of
a
nurse
with
good
wage
?
<EOS>
They
smooth
pillow
;
and
make
arrowroot
;
they
get
up
at
night
;
they
bear
complaint
and
querulousness
;
they
see
the
sun
shine
out
of
door
and
do
not
want
to
go
abroad
;
they
sleep
on
arm
-
chair
and
eat
their
meal
in
solitude
;
they
pass
long
long
evening
do
nothing
,
watch
the
ember
,
and
the
patient
's
drink
simmer
in
the
jug
;
they
read
the
weekly
paper
the
whole
week
through
;
and
Law
's
Serious
call
or
the
whole
Duty
of
Man
suffice
them
for
literature
for
the
year
 
<EOS>
and
we
quarrel
with
them
because
,
when
their
relation
come
to
see
them
once
a
week
,
a
little
gin
be
smuggle
in
in
their
linen
basket
.
<EOS>
lady
,
what
man
's
love
be
there
that
would
stand
a
year
's
nursing
of
the
object
of
his
affection
?
<EOS>
whereas
a
nurse
will
stand
by
you
for
ten
pound
a
quarter
,
and
we
think
her
too
highly
pay
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
Mr.
Crawley
grumble
a
good
deal
about
pay
half
as
much
to
Miss
Hester
for
her
constant
attendance
upon
the
Baronet
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
of
sunshiny
day
this
old
gentleman
be
take
out
in
a
chair
on
the
terrace
 
<EOS>
the
very
chair
which
Miss
Crawley
have
have
at
Brighton
,
and
which
have
be
transport
thence
with
a
number
of
Lady
Southdown
's
effect
to
Queen
's
Crawley
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jane
always
walk
by
the
old
man
,
and
be
an
evident
favourite
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
to
nod
many
time
to
her
and
smile
when
she
come
in
,
and
utter
inarticulate
deprecatory
moan
when
she
be
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
door
shut
upon
her
he
would
cry
and
sob
 
<EOS>
whereupon
Hester
's
face
and
manner
,
which
be
always
exceedingly
bland
and
gentle
while
her
lady
be
present
,
would
change
at
once
,
and
she
would
make
face
at
him
and
clench
her
fist
and
scream
out
"
hold
your
tongue
,
you
stoopid
old
fool
,
"
and
twirl
away
his
chair
from
the
fire
which
he
love
to
look
at
 
at
which
he
would
cry
more
.
<EOS>
for
this
be
all
that
be
leave
after
more
than
seventy
year
of
cunning
,
and
struggle
,
and
drinking
,
and

,
and
sin
and
selfishness
 
a

at

<EOS>
what
be
it
that
make
Pitt

it
because

He
would
not

<EOS>
Miss

reminiscence

<EOS>
Miss
Crawley
have
leave
her
a
little
annuity

<EOS>
She
would
have
be
content
to
remain
in
the
Crawley
family
with
Lady
Jane
,
who
be
good
to
her
and
to
everybody
;
but
Lady
Southdown
dismiss
poor
Briggs
as
quickly
as
decency
permit
;
and
Mr.
Pitt
(
who
think
himself
much
injure
by
the
uncalled
-
for
generosity
of
his
deceased
relative
towards
a
lady

Briggs
try

find
that
attempt

vain

<EOS>
Briggs
's
friend
,
small
tradesman
,
in
a
country

quarrel
over
Miss
Briggs
's
forty
pound

year
as
eagerly
and
more
openly

Miss

<EOS>
Briggs
's
brother
,
a
radical
hatter

grocer

call
his
sister
a
purse

proud
aristocrat

because
she
would
not
advance
a
part
of
her
capital

stock
his
shop

she
would
have
do
so
most
likely

that

<EOS>
the
dissent
shoemaker
want
Miss

<EOS>
between

finally
she

by
the
anathema

and
determine
to
seek
for
servitude
again
as
infinitely
less
onerous

<EOS>
and

humoured
woman
,
as
we
have

,
and
have
a
regard
for
Briggs

she
pull
up

Briggs

,
and
Becky

a
great

kiss
the
gentlewoman
as
soon
as
they
get
into

passage

and
thence

Mrs.

<EOS>
Briggs
tell
all
her
history
amidst
those
perfectly
uncalled

for
sobs
and
ejaculation
of
wonder
with
which
woman
of
her
soft
nature
salute
an
old
acquaintance
,
or
regard
a
rencontre
in
the
street
;
for
though
people
meet
other
people
every

yet
some
there
be
who
insist
upon
discover
miracle

and
woman
,
even
though
they
have
dislike
each
other
,
begin
to
cry
when
they
meet
,
deplore
and
remember
the
time
when
they
last
quarrel
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
in
a
word
,
Briggs
tell
all
her
history
,
and
Becky
give
a
narrative
of
her
own
life

with
her
usual
artlessness

candour

<EOS>
Mrs.

late
Firkin

come

grimly
in

front
parlour

<EOS>
Becky
have
never

with
a
very
sour
curtsey

and
her

cold

when
she
hold
them
out

Mrs.

<EOS>
this
be
just
such
a
companion
as
would
suit
her
establishment

she
invite
Briggs
to
come
to
dinner
with
her
that
very
evening

when
she
should
see
Becky

<EOS>
and
Briggs
promise
to
be
very
cautious

<EOS>
the
upshot
of
which
caution
be
that
she
go

Mrs.
Rawdon
the
next
week
,
and
have
lend
Rawdon
Crawley
six
hundred

in

Becky

on

first
journey

<EOS>
how
well

inexpressibly
pleasant

It

and

<EOS>
Rawdon

rather
abash

cast
down

on

<EOS>
what
recollection
of
boyhood
and
innocence
may
have
be
flit
across
his
brain

<EOS>
what
pang
of
dim
remorse
and
doubt
and
shame

<EOS>
"
Your

think
of

They

Rawdon

and
then

silent
 
<EOS>
so

Becky

<EOS>
both
of
them
be
rather
agitate
,
and
thinking
of
old
time

<EOS>
He
about
Eton

and
his

whom
he
remember
,
a
frigid
demure
woman
,
and
a
sister
who
die
,
of
whom
he
have
be
passionately
fond
;
and
how
he
use
to
thrash
Pitt
;
and
about
little
rawdy
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
and
Rebecca
think
about
her
own
youth
and
the
dark
secret
of
those
early
tainted
day
;
and
of
her
entrance
into
life
by
yonder
gate
;
and
of
Miss
Pinkerton
,
and
Joe

and
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
the
gravel

clean

<EOS>
a
grand

solemn
and
tall
personage
in

open
each

of

as
the
carriage

at
the
familiar

<EOS>
Rawdon
turn
red
,
and
Becky
somewhat
pale
,
as
they
pass
through
the
old
hall
,
arm
in
arm

<EOS>
She
pinch
her
husband
's
arm
as
they
enter
the
oak
parlour
,
where
Sir
Pitt
and
his
wife
be
ready
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
in
black
,
Lady
Jane
in
black
,
and
my
Lady
Southdown
with
a
large
black
head
-
piece
of
bugle
and
feather
,
which
wave
on
her
Ladyship
's
head
like
an
undertaker
's
tray
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
have
judge
correctly
,
that
she
would
not
quit
the
premise
.
<EOS>
She
content
herself
by
preserve
a
solemn
and
stony
silence
,
when
in
company
of
Pitt
and
his
rebellious
wife
,
and
by
frighten
the
child
in
the
nursery
by
the
ghastly
gloom
of
her
demeanour
.
<EOS>
only
a
very
faint
bending
of
the
head
-
dress
and
plume
welcome
Rawdon
and
his
wife
,
as
those
prodigal
return
to
their
family
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
they
be
not
affect
very
much
one
way
or
other
by
this
coolness
.
 
<EOS>
Her
Ladyship
be
a
person
only
of
secondary
consideration
in
their
mind
<EOS>
just
then
 
they
be
intent
upon
the
reception
which
the
reign
brother
and
sister
would
afford
them
.
  
<EOS>
Pitt
,
with
rather
a
heightened
colour
,
go
up
and
shake
his
brother
by
the
hand
,
and
salute
Rebecca
with
a
hand
-
shake
and
a
very
low
bow
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Jane
take
both
the
hand
of
her
sister
-
in

law
and
kiss
her
affectionately
.
<EOS>
the
embrace
somehow
bring
tear
into
the
eye
of
the
little
adventuress
 
which
ornament
,
<EOS>
as
we
know
,
she
wear
very
seldom

<EOS>
the
artless
mark
of
kindness
and
confidence
touch
and
please
her
;
and
Rawdon
,
encourage
by
this
demonstration
on
his
sister
's
part
,
twirl
up
his
mustachio
and
take
leave
to
salute
Lady

with
a
kiss
,
which
cause
her

to
blush
exceedingly

<EOS>
"
dev'lish
nice

<EOS>
"
Pitt

too
,
and
be
do
the
thing
handsomely
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
can
afford
it
,
"
say
Rebecca
and
agree
in
her
husband
's
farth
opinion
"
that
the
mother
-
in

law
be
a
tremendous
old
Guy
 
and
that
the
sister
be
rather
well
-
look
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
,
too
,
have
be
summon
from
school
to
attend
the
funeral
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
,
for
the
dignity
of
the
house
and
family
,
have
think
right
to
have
about
the
place
as
many
person
in
black
as
could
possibly
be
assemble
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
man
and
maid
of
the
house
,
the
old
woman
of
the
Alms
House
,
whom
the
eld
Sir
Pitt
have
cheat
out
of
a
great
portion
of
their
due
,
the
parish
clerk
's
family
,
and
the
special
retainer
of
both
Hall
and
Rectory
be
habit
in
sable
;
add
to
these
,
the
undertaker
's
man
,
at
least
a
score
,
with
crape
and
hatband
,
and
who
make
goodly
show
when
the
great
burying
show
take
place
 
<EOS>
but
these
be
mute
personage
in
our
drama
;
and
have
nothing
to
do
or
say
,
need
occupy
a
very
little
space
here
.
  
<EOS>
with
regard
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
Rebecca
do
not
attempt
to
forget
her
former
position
of
Governess
towards
them
,
but
recall
it
frankly
and
kindly
,
and
ask
them
about
their
study
with
great
gravity
,
and
tell
them
that
she
have
think
of
them
many
and
many
a
day
,
and
long
to
know
of
their
welfare
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
you
would
have
suppose
that
ever
since
she
have
leave
them
she
have
not
cease
to
keep
them
uppermost
in
her
thought
and
to
take
the
tender
interest
in
their
welfare
.
 
<EOS>
so
suppose
Lady
Crawley
herself
and
her
young
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
hardly
change
since
eight
year
,
"
say
Miss
Rosalind
to
Miss
Violet
,
as
they
be
prepare
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
those
red

haired
woman
look
wonderfully
well
,
"
reply
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hers
be
much
dark
than
it
be
;
I
think
she
must
dye
it

"
Miss
Rosalind
add
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
stouter
,
too
,
and
altogether
improve

"
continue
Miss
Rosalind
,
who
be
dispose
to
be
very
fat
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
least
she
give
herself
no
air
and
remember
that
she
be
our
Governess
once
,
"
Miss
Violet
say
,
intimate
that
it
befit
all
governess
to
keep
their
proper
place
,
and
forget
altogether
that
she
be
granddaughter
not
only
of
Sir
Walpole
Crawley
,
but
of
Mr.
Dawson
of
Mudbury
,
and
so
have
a
coal

scuttle
in
her
scutcheon
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
very
well
-
mean
people
whom
one
meet
every
day
in
Vanity
Fair
who
be
surely
equally
oblivious
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
true
what
the
girl
at
the
Rectory
say
,
that
her
mother
be
an
opera
-
dancer
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
a
person
can
not
help
their
birth
,
"
Rosalind
reply
with
great
liberality
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
agree
with
our
brother
,
that
as
she
be
in
the
family
,
of
course
we
be
bind
to
notice
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
Aunt
Bute
nee
not
talk
;
she
want
to
marry
Kate
to
young
Hooper
,
the
wine
-
merchant
,
and
absolutely
ask
him
to
come
to
the
Rectory
for
order
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
Lady
Southdown
will
go
away
,
she
look
very
glum
upon
Mrs.
Rawdon
,
"
the
other
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
she
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
read
the
Washerwoman
of
Finchley
Common
,
"
vow
violet
;
and
so
say
,
and
avoid
a
passage
at
the
end
of
which
a
certain
coffin
be
place
with
a
couple
of
watcher
,
and
light
perpetually
burn
in
the
closed
room
,
these
young
woman
come
down
to
the
family
dinner
,
for
which
the
bell
ring
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
this
,
Lady
Jane
conduct
Rebecca
to
the
apartment
prepare
for
her
,
which
,
with
the
rest
of
the
house
,
have
assume
a
very
much
improved
appearance
of
order
and
comfort
during
Pitt
's
regency
,
and
here
behold
that
Mrs.
Rawdon
's
modest
little
trunk
have
arrive
,
and
be
place
in
the
bedroom
and
dressing
-
room
adjoining
,
help
her
to
take
off
her
neat
black
bonnet
and
cloak
,
and
ask
her
sister
-
in
-
law
in
what
more
she
could
be
useful
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
should
like
good
,
"
say
Rebecca
,
"
would
be
to
go
to
the
nursery
and
see
your
dear
little
child
.
"
<EOS>
on
which
the
two
lady
look
very
kindly
at
each
other
and
go
to
that
apartment
hand
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Becky
admire
little
Matilda
,
who
be
not
quite
four
year
old
,
as
the
most
charming
little
love
in
the
world
;
and
the
boy
,
a
little
fellow
of
two
year
 
pale
,
heavy

eyed
,
and
large

head
 
<EOS>
she
pronounce
to
be
a
perfect
prodigy
in
point
of
size
,
intelligence
,
and
beauty

<EOS>
"
I
wish
Mamma
would
not
insist
on
give
him
so
much
medicine
,
"
Lady
Jane
say
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
often
think
we
should
all
be
well
without
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
Lady
Jane
and
her
new
-
find
friend
have
one
of
those
confidential
medical
conversation
about
the
child
,
which
all
mother
,
and
most
woman
,
as
I
be
give
to
understand
,
delight
in
.
<EOS>
fifty
year
ago
,
and
when
the
present
writer
,
be
an
interesting
little
boy
,
be
order
out
of
the
room
with
the
lady
after
dinner
,
I
remember
quite
well
that
their
talk
be
chiefly
about
their
ailment
;
and
put
this
question
directly
to
two
or
three
since
,
I
have
always
get
from
them
the
acknowledgement
that
time
be
not
change
.
 
<EOS>
let
my
fair
reader
remark
for
themselves
this
very
evening
when
they
quit
the
dessert
-
table
and
assemble
to
celebrate
the
drawing
-
room
mystery
.
<EOS>
well
 
in
half
an
hour
Becky
and
Lady
Jane
be
close
and
intimate
friend
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
course
of
the
evening
her
Ladyship
inform
Sir
Pitt
that
she
think
her
new
sister
-
in
-
law
be
a
kind
,
frank
,
unaffected
,
and
affectionate
young
woman
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
have
easily
win
the
daughter
's
good
-
will
,
the
indefatigable
little
woman
bend
herself
to
conciliate
the
august
Lady
Southdown
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
find
her
Ladyship
alone
,
Rebecca
attack
her
on
the
nursery
question
at
once
and
say
that
her
own
little
boy
be
save
,
actually
save
,
by
calomel
,
freely
administer
,
when
all
the
physician
in
Paris
have
give
the
dear
child
up
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
mention
how
often
she
have
hear
of
Lady
Southdown
from
that
excellent
man
<EOS>
the
Reverend
Lawrence
Grills
,
Minister
of
the
chapel
in
May
Fair
,
which
she
frequent
;
and
how
her
view
be
very
much
change
by
circumstance
and
misfortune
;
and
how
she
hope
that
a
past
life
spend
in
worldliness
and
error
may
not
incapacitate
her
from
more
serious
thought
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
She
describe
how
in
former
day
she
have
be
indebte
to
Mr.
Crawley
for
religious
instruction
,
touch
upon
the
Washerwoman
of
Finchley
Common
,
which
she
have
read
with
the
great
profit
,
and
ask
about
Lady
Emily
,
its
gifted
author
,
now
Lady
Emily
Hornblower
,
at
Cape
Town
,
where
her
husband
have
strong
hope
of
become
Bishop
of
Caffraria
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
crown
all
,
and
confirm
herself
in
Lady
Southdown
's
favour
,
by
feel
very
much
agitated
and
unwell
after
the
funeral
and
request
her
Ladyship
's
medical
advice
,
which
the
Dowager
not
only
give
,
but
,
wrap
up
in
a
bed
-
gown
and
look
more
like
Lady
Macbeth
than
ever
,
come
privately
in
the
night
to
Becky
's
room
with
a
parcel
of
favourite
tract
,
and
a
medicine
of
her
own
composition
,
which
she
insist
that
Mrs.
Rawdon
should
take
.
  
<EOS>
Becky
first
accept
the
tract
and
begin
to
examine
them
with
great
interest
,
engage
the
Dowager
in
a
conversation
concern
them
and
the
welfare
of
her
soul
,
by
which
mean
she
hope
that
her
body
may
escape
medication
.
 
<EOS>
but
after
the
religious
topic
be
exhaust
,
Lady
Macbeth
would
not
quit
Becky
's
chamber
until
her
cup
of
night
-
drink
be
empty
too
;
and
poor
Mrs.
Rawdon
be
compel
actually
to
assume
a
look
of
gratitude
,
and
to
swallow
the
medicine
under
the
unyielding
old
Dowager
's
nose
,
who
leave
her
victim
finally
with
a
benediction
.
  
<EOS>
It
do
not
much
comfort
Mrs.
Rawdon
;
her
countenance
be
very
queer
when
Rawdon
come
in
and
hear
what
have
happen
;
and
his
explosion
of
laughter
be
as
loud
as
usual
,
when
Becky

with
a
fun

expense
,
describe
the
occurrence

<EOS>
Lord

have
many
a
laugh
over
the
story
when
Rawdon

<EOS>
Becky
act
the
whole

She

and
gown

<EOS>
She
preach
a
great
sermon
in
the
true
serious
manner
;
she
lecture
on
the
virtue
of
the
medicine
which
she
pretend
to
administer
,
with
a
gravity
of
imitation
so
perfect
that
you
would
have
think
it
be
the
Countess

own
roman
nose
through
which
she
snuffle

"
<EOS>
give

it
be
in
those
security
that
she
would
have

<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
,
have
strike
her

to
have
be
honest

humble
,
to
have
do
her
duty
,

to
have
march
straightforward
on

would
have
bring
her
as
near
happiness
as

path
by

attain
it

<EOS>
but
 
just
as

go
round
the

the

if
ever
Becky

she
be
accustomed

<EOS>
She
elude
them

despise
them
 
or
at

she
be
commit

the
other
path
from
which
retreat

impossible

<EOS>
and
for
my
part
I
believe
that
remorse
be
the
least
active
of
all
a

moral
sense
 
the
very
easy
to
be
deaden

<EOS>
We
grieve
at

at

the
mere

wrong
make
very
few
people
unhappy

She

Queen

<EOS>
considerable

He

event

in

he

to
have
his

<EOS>
to
be
thwart
in
this
reasonable
desire
be
always
very
injurious
to
the
old

;
and
resistance
become
doubly
exasperating
when
gout
,
age
,
loneliness
,
and
the
force
of
many
disappointment
combine
to
weigh
him
down

<EOS>
His
stiff
black
hair
begin
to
grow
quite
white
soon

his

I

would

<EOS>
He

Miss

I

she
use

in

to

turn
the

menace
that

half
an

afterwards
dismiss

to
her
that

as

he
do
not
choose

It

sometimes
to
Russell
Square
too
,
to
pay
a
visit
to
their
old
acquaintance
Miss
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
in
consequence
of
the
command
of
their

the
Major
in
India
(
for
whom
their

have
a
prodigious
respect
)
,
that

attention
to
Mrs.
George

for
the
Major
,
the
godfather

guardian
of
Amelia

still
hope
that
the

may

induce

relent
towards
him

acknowledge
him
for

of
his

<EOS>
Mrs.

know
the

appreciate
his

<EOS>
Glorvina

a

fresh

coloured

black

,
blue

young
lady
,
who
could
ride
a
horse

or
play
a
sonata
with
any

out

County
Cork
,
seem
to
be
the
very
person
destine

insure

happiness
 
much
more
than

Amelia

about
whom
he
use

take
on
so

<EOS>
"
look

Glorvina
enter
a

"
Mrs.
O'Dowd
would
say
,
"
and
compare
her
with
that
poor
Mrs.
Osborne
,
who
could
not
say
boo
to
a

<EOS>
She
would
be
worthy

<EOS>
you
be
a
quiet
man
yourself

and
want
some
one

let
me
tell
ye
,
she
be
of
an
ancient
family
that
any
nobleman
may
be
proud
to
marry
into

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
before
she
have
come
to
such
a
resolution
and
determine
to
subjugate
Major
Dobbin
by
her
endearment
,
it
must
be
own
that
Glorvina
have
practise
them
a
good
deal
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
have
a
season
in
Dublin

and
who
know
how
many
in
Cork
,
Killarney
,
and
Mallow

<EOS>
She
have
flirt

all
the
marriageable
officer
whom
the

all
the

<EOS>
She

be
marry
a
half

score
time
in
Ireland

besides
the
clergyman
at
Bath
who
use

<EOS>
She
have
flirt
all
the

to
Madras
with
the
Captain

of
the

and

while
the

<EOS>
everybody
admire

everybody
dance

but
no

propose
who
be
worth
the
marrying
 
<EOS>
one
or
two
exceedingly
young
subaltern
sigh
after
her
,
and
a
beardless
civilian
or
two
,
but
she
reject
these
as
beneath
her
pretension
 
and
other
and
young
virgin
than
Glorvina
be
marry
before
her

<EOS>
there
be
woman
,
and
handsome
woman
too
,
who
have
this
fortune
in
life

<EOS>
They
fall
in
love
with
the
utmost
generosity
;
they
ride
and
walk
with
half
the
Army

list
,
though
they
draw
near
to
forty
,
and
yet
the
Misses
O'Grady
be
the
Misses
O'Grady
still
:
 
<EOS>
Glorvina
persist
that
<EOS>
but
for
Lady
O'Dowd
's
unlucky
quarrel
with
the
Judge
's
lady
,
she
would
have
make
a
good
match
at
Madras
,
where
old
Mr.
Chutney
,
who
be
at
the
head
of
the
civil
service
(
and
who
afterwards
marry
Miss
Dolby
,
a
young
lady
only
thirteen
year
of
age
who
have
just
arrive
from
school
in
Europe
)
,
be
just
at
the
point
of
propose
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
although
Lady
O'Dowd
and
Glorvina
quarrel
a
great
number
of
time
every
day
,
and
upon
almost
every
conceivable
subject
 
indeed
,
if
Mick
O'Dowd
have
not
possess
the
temper
of
an
angel
two
such
woman
constantly
about
his
ear
would
have
drive
him
out
of
his
sense
 
yet
they
agree
between
themselves
on
this
point
,
that
Glorvina
should
marry
Major
Dobbin
,
and
be
determine
that
the
Major
should
have
no
rest
until
the
arrangement
be
bring
about
.
<EOS>
undismaye
by
forty
or
fifty
previous
defeat
,
Glorvina
lay
siege
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
sing
irish
melody
at
him
unceasingly
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
him
so
frequently
and
pathetically
,
Will
ye
come
to
the
bower
?
<EOS>
that
it
be
a
wonder
how
any
man
of
feeling
could
have
resist
the
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
never
tired
of
inquire
,
if
Sorrow
have
his
young
day
fade
,
and
be
ready
to
listen
and
weep
like
Desdemona
at
the
story
of
his
danger
and
his
campaign
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
our
honest
and
dear
old
friend
use
to
perform
on
the
flute
in
private
;
Glorvina
insist
upon
have
duet
with
him
,
and
Lady
O'Dowd
would
rise
and
artlessly
quit
the
room
when
the
young
couple
be
so
engaged
.
<EOS>
Glorvina
force
the
Major
to
ride
with
her
of
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
cantonment
see
them
set
out
and
return
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
constantly
write
note
over
to
him
at
his
house
,
borrow
his
book
,
and
score
with
her
great
pencil
-
mark
such
passage
of
sentiment
or
humour
as
awaken
her
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
She
borrow
his
horse
,
his
servant
,
his
spoon
,
and
palanquin
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
public
rumour
assign
her
to
him
,
and
that
the
Major
's
sister
in
England
should
fancy
they
be
about
to
have
a
sister
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
Dobbin
,
who
be
thus
vigorously
besiege
,
be
in
the
meanwhile
in
a
state
of
the
most
odious
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
He
use
to
laugh
when
the
young
fellow
of
the
regiment
joke
him
about
Glorvina
's
manifest
attention
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
she
be
only
keep
her
hand
in
 
<EOS>
she
practise
upon
me
as
she
do
upon
Mrs.
Tozer
's
piano
,
because
it
be
the
most
handy
instrument
in
the
station
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
too
battered
and
old
for
such
a
fine
young
lady
as
Glorvina
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
on
ride
with
her
,
and
copy
music
and
verse
into
her
album
,
and
play
at
chess
with
her
very
submissively
;
for
it
be
with
these
simple
amusement
that
some
officer
in
India
be
accustomed
to
while
away
their
leisure
moment
,
while
other
of
a
less
domestic
turn
hunt
hog
,
and
shoot
snipe
,
or
gamble
and
smoke
cheroot
,
and
betake
themselves
to
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Sir
Michael
O'Dowd
,
though
his
lady
and
her
sister
both
urge
him
to
call
upon
the
Major
to
explain
himself
and
not
keep
on
torture
a
poor
innocent
girl
in
that
shameful
way
,
the
old
soldier
refuse
point
-
blank
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
"
faith
,
the
Major
's
big
enough
to
choose
for
himself
,
"
Sir
Michael
say
;
"
he
will
ask
ye
when
he
want
ye
"
;
or
else
he
would
turn
the
matter
off
jocularly
,
declare
that
"
Dobbin
be
too
young
to
keep
house
,
and
have
write
home
to
ask
lave
of
his
mamma
.
"
<EOS>
nay
,
he
go
farther
,
and
in
private
communication
with
his
Major
would
caution
and
rally
him
,
cry
,
"
mind
your
oi
,
dob
,
<EOS>
my
boy
,
them
girl
be
bent
on
mischief
 
<EOS>
me
Lady
have
just
get
a
box
of
gown
from
Europe
,
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
pink
satin
for
Glorvina
,
which
will
finish
ye
,
 
<EOS>
dob
,
if
it
be
in
the
power
of
woman
or
satin
to
move
ye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
truth
be
,
neither
beauty
nor
fashion
could
conquer
him
.
 
<EOS>
Our
honest
friend
have
but
one
idea
of
a
woman
in
his
head
,
and
that
one
do
not
in
the
least
resemble
Miss
Glorvina
O'Dowd
in
pink
satin
.
 
<EOS>
a
gentle
little
woman
in
black
,
with
large
eye
and
brown
hair
,
seldom
speak
,
save
when
speak
to
,
and
then
in
a
voice
not
the
least
resemble
Miss
Glorvina
's
 
a
soft
young
mother
tend
an
infant
and
beckon
the
Major
up
with
a
smile
to
look
at
him
 
a
rosy
-
cheek
lass
come
singe
into
the
room
in
Russell
Square
or
hang
on
George
Osborne
's
arm
,
happy
and
loving
 
<EOS>
there
be
but
<EOS>
this
image
that
fill
our
honest
Major
's
mind
,
by
day
and
by
night
,
and
reign
over
it
always
.
 
<EOS>
very
likely
Amelia
be
not
like
the
portrait
the
Major
have
form
of
her
:
there
be
a
figure
in
a
book
of
fashion
which
his
sister
have
in
England
,
and
with
which
William
have
make
away
privately
,
paste
it
into
the
lid
of
his
desk
,
and
fancy
he
see
some
resemblance
to
Mrs.
Osborne
in
the
print
,
whereas
I
have
see
it
,
and
can
vouch
that
it
be
but
the
picture
of
a
high
-
waiste
gown
with
an
impossible
doll
's
face
simper
over
it
 
and
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Dobbin
's
sentimental
Amelia
be
no
more
like
the
real
one
than
this
absurd
little
print
which
he
cherish
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
man
in
love
,
of
us
,
be
better
inform
?
 
<EOS>
or
be
he
much
happy
when
he
see
and
own
his
delusion
?
<EOS>
Dobbin
be
under
this
spell
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
bother
his
friend
and
the
public
much
about
his
feeling
,
or
indeed
lose
his
natural
rest
or
appetite
on
account
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
have
grizzle
since
we
see
him
last
,
and
a
line
or
two
of
silver
may
be
see
in
the
soft
brown
hair
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
feeling
be
not
in
the
least
changed
or
oldened
,
and
his
love
remain
as
fresh
as
a
man
's
recollection
of
boyhood
be
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
say
how
the
two
Misses
Dobbin
and
Amelia
,
the
Major
's
correspondent
in
Europe
,
write
him
letter
from
England
,
Mrs.
Osborne
congratulate
him
with
great
candour
and
cordiality
upon
his
approach
nuptial
with
Miss
O'Dowd
.
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
have
just
kindly
visit
me
,
"
Amelia
write
in
her
letter

and
inform
me
of
an
interesting
EVENT

upon
which
I
beg
to
offer
my
MOST
SINCERE
congratulation

<EOS>
I
hope
the
young
lady
to
whom
I
hear
you

in
every
respect
prove
worthy

Georgy
send
his
love
to
his

hope
that
you
will
not

<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
you
be
about
to
form
other
tie
,
with
one
who
I
be
sure
merit
all
your
affection

but
that
,
although
such
tie
must
of
course
be
the
strong
and
most
sacred
,
and
supersede
all
other
,
yet
that
I
be
sure
the
widow
and
the
child

you
have
ever
protect
and
love
will
always
have
a
corner
in
your

every
scrap
of

that
she
have
ever
send
to
him
 
<EOS>
how
cold
,
how
kind
,
how
hopeless
,
how
selfish
they
be
!
  
<EOS>
have
there
be
some
kind
gentle
soul
near
at
hand
who
could
read
and
appreciate
this
silent
generous
heart
,
who
know
but
that
the
reign
of
Amelia
may
have
be
over
,
and
that
friend
<EOS>
William
's
love
may
have
flow
into
a
kind
channel
?
<EOS>
but
there
be
only
Glorvina
of
the
jetty
ringlet
with
whom
his
intercourse
be
familiar
,
and
this
dash
young
woman
be
not
bent
upon
love
the
Major
,
but
rather
on
make
the
major
admire
HER
 
a
most
vain
and
hopeless
task
,
too
,
at
least
consider
the
mean
that
the
poor
girl
possess
to
carry
it
out
.
<EOS>
She
curl
her
hair
and
show
her
shoulder
at
him
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
do
ye
ever
see
such
jet
ringlet
and
such
a
complexion
?
<EOS>
She
grin
at
him
so
that
he
may
see
that
every
tooth
in
her
head
be
sound
 
<EOS>
and
he
never
heed
all
these
charm
.
 
<EOS>
very
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
box
of
millinery
,
and
perhaps
indeed
in
honour
of
it
,
Lady
O'Dowd
and
the
lady
of
the
King
's
Regiment
give
a
ball
to
the
company
's
Regiments
and
the
civilian
at
the
station
.
 
<EOS>
Glorvina
sport
the
kill
pink
frock
,
and
the
Major
,
who
attend
the
party
and
walk
very
ruefully
up
and
down
the
room
,
never
so
much
as
perceive
the
pink
garment
.
<EOS>
Glorvina
dance
past
him
in
a
fury
with
all
the
young
subaltern
of
the
station
,
and
the
Major
be
not
in
the
least
jealous
of
her
performance
,
or
angry
because
Captain
Bangles
of
the
Cavalry
hand
her
to
supper
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
jealousy
,
or
frock
,
or
shoulder
that
could
move
him
,
and
Glorvina
have
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
so
these
two
be
each
exemplify
the
vanity
of
this
life
,
and
each
longing
for
what
he
or
she
could
not
get
.
<EOS>
Glorvina
cry
with
rage
at
the
failure
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
set
her
mind
on
the
Major
"
more
than
on
any
of
the
other

"
she
own
,
sob

<EOS>
"
He
will
break
my
heart
,

she
would
whimper
to
her
sister

"
fat
or
thin

laughing
or
melancholy
,
on
horseback
or
the
music
-
stool
,
it
be
all
the
same
to
the
Major
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
Colonel
,
puff
his
pipe
and
listen
to
these
complaint
,
would
suggest
that
glory
should
have
some
black
frock

and
tell
a
mysterious

of

while

in

have
pick
up
for

the

teller

It

finish
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Rebecca
listen
to
Pitt
,
she
talk
to
him
,
she
sing
to
him
,
she
coax
him
,
and
cuddle
him
,
so
that
he
find
himself
more
and
more
glad
every
day
to
get
back
from
the
lawyer
's
at
Gray
's
Inn
,
to
the
blaze
fire
in
Curzon
Street
 
a
gladness
in
which
the
man
of
law
likewise
participate
,
for
Pitt
's
harangue
be
of
the
long
 
<EOS>
and
so
that
when
he
go
away
he
feel
quite
a
pang
at
depart
.
<EOS>
how
pretty
she
look
kiss
her
hand
to
him
from
the
carriage
and
wave
her
handkerchief
when
he
have
take
his
place
in
the
mail
!
<EOS>
She
put
the
handkerchief
to
her
eye
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
pull
his
sealskin
cap
over
his
,
as
the
coach
drive
away
,
and
,
sink
back
<EOS>
,
he
think
to
himself
how
she
respect
him
and
how
he
deserve
it
,
and
how
Rawdon
be
a
foolish
dull
fellow
who
do
not
half
-
appreciate
his
wife
;
and
how
mum
and
stupid
his
own
wife
be
compare
to
that
brilliant
little
Becky
.
 
<EOS>
Becky
have
hint
every
one
of
these
thing
herself
,
perhaps
,
but
so
delicately
and
gently
that
you
hardly
know
when
or
where
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
before
they
part
,
it
be
agree
that
the
house
in
London
should
be
redecorate
for
the
next
season
,
and
that
the
brother
'
family
should
meet
again
in
the
country
at
Christmas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
could
have
get
a
little
money
out
of
him
,
"
Rawdon
say
to
his
wife
moodily
when
the
Baronet
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
give
something
to
old
Raggles
,
<EOS>
hang
if
I
should
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
right
,
you
know
,
that
the
old
fellow
should
be
keep
out
of
all
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
inconvenient
,
and
he
may
let
to
somebody
else
besides
us
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
him
,
"
say
Becky
,
"
that
as
soon
as
Sir
Pitt
's
affair
be
settle
,
everybody
will
be
pay
,
and
give
him
a
little
something
on
account
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
cheque
that
Pitt
leave
for
the
boy
,
"
and
she
take
from
her
bag
and
give
her
husband
a
paper
which
his
brother
have
hand
over
to
her
,
on
behalf
of
the
little
son
and
heir
of
the
young
branch
of
the
Crawleys
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
she
have
try
personally
the
ground
on
which
her
husband
express
a
wish
that
she
should
venture
 
try
it
ever
so
delicately
,
and
find
it
unsafe
.
<EOS>
even
at
a
hint
about
embarrassment
,
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
be
off
and
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
begin
a
long
speech
,
explain
how
straiten
he
himself
be
in
money
matter
<EOS>
;
how
the
tenant
would
not
pay
;
how
his
father
's
affair
,
and
the
expense
attendant
upon
the
demise
of
the
old
gentleman
,
have
involve
him
;
how
he
want
to
pay
off
incumbrance
;
and
how
the
banker
and
agent
be
overdraw
;
and
Pitt
Crawley
end
by
make
a
compromise
with
his
sister
-
in
-
law
and
give
her
a
very
small
sum
for
the
benefit
of
her
little
boy
.
  
<EOS>
Pitt
know
how
poor
his
brother
and
his
brother
's
family
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
have
escape
the
notice
of
such
a
cool
and
experience
old
diplomatist
that
Rawdon
's
family
have
nothing
to
live
upon
,
and
that
house
and
carriage
be
not
to
be
keep
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
that
he
be
the
proprietor
or
appropriator
of
the
money
,
which
,
accord
to
all
proper
calculation
,
ought
to
have
fall
to
his
young
brother
,
and
he
have
,
we
may
be
sure
,
some
secret
pang
of
remorse
within
him
,
which
warn
him
that
he
ought
to
perform
some
act
of
justice
,
or
,
let
us
say
,
compensation
,
towards
these
disappointed
relation
.
 
<EOS>
a
just
,
decent
man
,
not
without
brain
,
who
say
his
prayer
,
and
know
his
catechism
,
and
do
his
duty
outwardly
through
life
,
he
could
not
be
otherwise
than
aware
that
something
be
due
to
his
brother
at
his
hand
,
and
that
morally
he
be
Rawdon
's
debtor
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
one
read
in
the
column
of
the
Times
newspaper
every
now
and
then
,
queer
announcement
from
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
50
pound
from
A.
B.
,
or
10
pound
from
W.
T.
,
as
conscience
-
money
,
on
account
of
taxis
due
by
the
say
A.
B.
or
W.
T.
,
which
payment
the
penitent
beg
the
Right
honourable
gentleman
to
acknowledge
through
the
medium
of
the
public
press
 
<EOS>
so
be
the
Chancellor
no
doubt
,
and
the
reader
likewise
,
always
perfectly
sure
that
the
above
-
name
A.
B.
 
and
W.
T.
be
only
pay
a
very
small
instalment
of
what
they
really
owe
,
and
that
the
man
who
send
up
a
twenty
-
pound
note
have
very
likely
hundred
or
thousand
more
for
which
he
ought
to
account
.
 
<EOS>
such
,
at
least
,
be
my
feeling
,
when
I
see
A.
B.
or
W.
t."s
insufficient
act
of
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
Pitt
Crawley
's
contrition
,
or
kindness
if
you
will
,
towards
his
young
brother
,
by
whom
he
have
so
much
profit
,
be
only
a
very
small
dividend
upon
the
capital
sum
in
which
he
be
indebte
to
Rawdon
.
<EOS>
not
everybody
be
willing
to
pay
even
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
to
part
with
money
be
a
sacrifice
beyond
almost
all
man
endow
with
a
sense
of
order
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
scarcely
any
man
alive
who
do
not
think
himself
meritorious
for
give
his
neighbour
five
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Thriftless
give
,
not
from
a
beneficent
pleasure
in
giving
,
but
from
a
lazy
delight
in
spending
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
deny
himself
one
enjoyment
;
not
his
opera
-
stall
,
not
his
horse
,
not
his
dinner
,
not
even
the
pleasure
of
give
Lazarus
the
five
pound
.
 
<EOS>
Thrifty
,
who
be
good
,
wise
,
just
,
and
owe
no
man
a
penny
,
turn
from
a
beggar
,
haggle
with
a
hackney
-
coachman
,
or
deny
a
poor
relation
,
and
I
doubt
which
be
the
most
selfish
of
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
money
have
only
a
different
value
in
the
eye
of
each
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
in
a
word
,
Pitt
Crawley
think
he
would
do
something
for
his
brother
,
and
then
think
that
he
would
think
about
it
some
other
time
.
  
<EOS>
and
with
regard
to
Becky
,
she
be
not
a
woman
who
expect
too
much
from
the
generosity
of
her
neighbour
,
and
so
be
quite
content
with
all
that
Pitt
Crawley
have
do
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
acknowledge
by
the
head
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
if
Pitt
would
not
give
her
anything
,
he
would
get
something
for
her
some
day
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
get
no
money
from
her
brother
-
in
-
law
,
she
get
what
be
as
good
as
money
 
<EOS>
credit
.
 
<EOS>
Raggles
be
make
rather
easy
in
his
mind
by
the
spectacle
of
the
union
between
the
brother
,
by
a
small
payment
on
the
spot
,
and
by
the
promise
of
a
much
large
sum
speedily
to
be
assign
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
Rebecca
tell
Miss
Briggs
,
whose
Christmas
dividend
upon
the
little
sum
lend
by
her
Becky
pay
with
an
air
of
candid
joy
,
and
as
if
her
exchequer
be
brim
over
with
gold
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
,
we
say
,
tell
Miss
Briggs
,
in
strict
confidence
that
she
have
confer
with
Sir
Pitt
,
who
be
famous
as
a
financier
,
on
Briggs
's
special
behalf
,
as
to
the
most
profitable
investment
of
Miss
b."s
remain
capital
;
that
Sir
Pitt
,
after
much
consideration
,
have
think
of
a
most
safe
and
advantageous
way
in
which
Briggs
could
lay
out
her
money
;
that
,
be
especially
interested
in
her
as
an
attach
friend
of
the
late
Miss
Crawley
,
and
of
the
whole
family
,
and
that
long
before
he
leave
town
,
he
have
recommend
that
she
should
be
ready
with
the
money
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
so
as
to
purchase
at
the
most
favourable
opportunity
the
share
which
Sir
Pitt
have
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Briggs
be
very
grateful
for
this
mark
of
Sir
Pitt
's
attention
 
<EOS>
it
come
so
unsolicited
,
she
say
,
for
she
never
should
have
think
of
remove
the
money
from
the
fund
 
and
the
delicacy
enhance
the
kindness
of
the
office
;
and
she
promise
to
see
her
man
of
business
immediately
and
be
ready
with
her
little
cash
at
the
proper
hour
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
worthy
woman
be
so
grateful
for
the
kindness
of
Rebecca
in
the
matter
,
and
for
that
of
her
generous
benefactor
,
the
Colonel
,
that
she
go
out
and
spend
a
great
part
of
her
half
-
year
's
dividend
in
the
purchase
of
a
black
velvet
coat
for
little
Rawdon
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
be
grow
almost
too
big
for
black
velvet
now
,
and
be
of
a
size
and
age
befit
him
for
the
assumption
of
the
virile
jacket
and
pantaloon
.
  
<EOS>
He

fine
open

who
have

to
Molly

the

who
cram
him
with
ghost

at

and
with
good

plague
and
laugh
at
 
and
to
his
father
especially
,
whose
attachment
towards
the
lad
be
curious
too
to
witness
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
as
he
grow
to
be
about
eight
year
old
,
his
attachment
may
be
say
to
have
end
.

His

violently
a

<EOS>
He
hear
a
laugh
from
the
Marquis
in
the
inner

(
who
be
amuse
by
this
free
and
artless
exhibition
of
Becky

temper
)
and
flee
down
below
to
his
friend
of
the
kitchen
,
burst
in
an
agony
of
grief
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
because
it
hurt
me
,
"
little
Rawdon
gasp
out
 
"
only
 
only

<EOS>
It

"

<EOS>
why

as

"
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
after

,
the

increase
to
hatred
;
the
consciousness
that
the

His

Rawdon

Becky

and
would
have
do
so
but
for
Lady

urgent
invitation
to
the

and
the
symptom
of
revolt

He

He

<EOS>
and
as

and
look
at

,
they
could
talk
without
too
much
bore
each

<EOS>
and
Pitt
take
care
to
tell
Rawdon
what
a
heavy
outlay
of
money
these
improvement
have
occasion
,
and
that
a
man
of

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
between

London
 
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
have
do
more
than
repair
fence
and
restore
dilapidated
lodge
on
the
Queen
's
Crawley
estate
.
<EOS>
like
a
wise
man
he
have
set
to
work
to
rebuild
the
injure
popularity
of
his
house
and
stop
up
the
gap
and
ruin
in
which
his
name
have
be
leave
by
his
disreputable
and
thriftless
old
predecessor
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
elect
for
the
borough
speedily
after
his
father
's
demise
;
a
magistrate
,
a
member
of
parliament
,
a
county
magnate
and
representative
of
an
ancient
family

he
make
it
his

before
the
Hampshire
public
,
subscribe
handsomely
to
the
county
charity
,
call
assiduously
upon
all
the
county
folk
,
and
lay
himself
out
in
a
word
to
take
that
position
in
Hampshire
,
and
in
the
Empire
afterwards
,
to
which
he
think
his
prodigious
talent
justly
entitle
him
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jane
be
instruct
to
be
friendly
with
the
Fuddlestones
,
and
the
wapshot
,
and
the
other
famous
baronet
,
their
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
Their
carriage
may
frequently
be
see
in
the
Queen
's
Crawley
avenue
now
;
they
dine
pretty
frequently
at
the
Hall
(
where
the
cookery
be
so
good
that
it
be
clear
Lady
Jane
<EOS>
very
seldom
have
a
hand
in
it
)
,
and
in
return
Pitt
and
his
wife
most
energetically
dine
out
in
all
sort
of
weather
and
at
all
sort
of
distance
.
 
<EOS>
for
though
Pitt
do
not
care
for
joviality
,
be
a
frigid
man
of
poor
hearth
and
appetite
,
yet
he
consider
that
to
be
hospitable
and
condescending
be
quite
incumbent
on
-
his
station
,
and
<EOS>
every
time
that
he
get
a
headache
from
too
long
an
after
-
dinner
sitting
,
he
feel
that
he
be
a
martyr
to
duty
.
 
<EOS>
He
talk
about
crop
,
corn
-
law
,
politic
,
with
the
good
country
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
(
who
have
be
formerly
inclined
to
be
a
sad
free
-
thinker
on
these
point
)
enter
into
poaching
and
game
preserve
with
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
hunt
;
he
be
not
a
hunting
man
;
he
be
a
man
of
book
and
peaceful
habit
;
but
he
think
that
the
breed
of
horse
must
be
keep
up
in
the
country
,
and
that
the
breed
of
fox
must
therefore
be
look
to
,
and
for
his
part
,
if
his
friend
,
Sir
Huddlestone
Fuddlestone
,
like
to
draw
his
country
and
meet
as
of
old
the
F.
 
hound
use
to
do
at
Queen
's
Crawley
,
he
should
be
happy
to
see
him
there
,
and
the
gentleman
of
the
Fuddlestone
hunt
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
Lady
Southdown
's
dismay
too
<EOS>
he
become
more
orthodox
in
his
tendency
every
day
;
give
up
preach
in
public
and
attend
meeting
-
house
;
go
stoutly
to
church
;
call
on
the
Bishop
and
all
the
Clergy
at
Winchester
;
and
make
no
objection
when
the
venerable
Archdeacon
Trumper
ask
for
a
game
of
whist
.
 
<EOS>
what
pang
must
have
be
those
of
Lady
Southdown
,
and
what
an
utter
castaway
she
must
have
think
her
son
-
in
-
law
for
permit
such
a
godless
diversion
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
,
on
the
return
of
the
family
from
an
oratorio
at
Winchester
,
the
Baronet
announce
to
the
young
lady
that
he
should
next
year
very
probably
take
them
to
the
"
county
ball
,
"
they
worship
him
for
his
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Jane
be
only
too
obedient
,
and
perhaps
glad
herself
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dowager
write
off
the
dire
description
of
her
daughter
's
worldly
behaviour
to
the
authoress
of
the
Washerwoman
of
Finchley
Common
at
the
Cape
;
and
her
house
in
Brighton
be
about
this
time
unoccupied
,
return
to
that
watering
-
place
,
her
absence
be
not
very
much
deplore
by
her
child
.
<EOS>
We
may
suppose
,
too
,
that
Rebecca
,
on
pay
a
second
visit
to
Queen
's
Crawley
,
do
not
feel
particularly
grieve
at
the
absence
of
the
lady
of
the
medicine
chest
;
though
she
write
a
Christmas
letter
to
her
Ladyship
,
in
which
she
respectfully
recall
herself
to
Lady
Southdown
's
recollection
,
speak
with
gratitude
of
the
delight
which
her
Ladyship
's
conversation
have
give
her
on
the
former
visit
,
dilate
on
the
kindness
with
which
her
Ladyship
have
treat
her
in
sickness
,
and
declare
that
everything
at
Queen
's
Crawley
remind
her
of
her
absent
friend
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
part
of
the
alter
demeanour
and
popularity
of
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
may
have
be
trace
to
the
counsel
of
that
astute

<EOS>
You

.
 
<EOS>
I
show
Lord

<EOS>
He
be
familiar

in
the
opinion
of
the
whole
Cabinet
the
most
masterly
thing
that

appear
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
Ministry

its
eye
upon

and
I

<EOS>
You

England
(

at
Oxford
be
still
remember
)
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
be
member
for
the
County

where
,
with
your
own
vote
and
your
borough
at
your
back
,
you
can
command
anything
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
want
to
be
Baron
Crawley
of
Queen
's
Crawley
,
and
will
be
before
you
die
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
read
your
heart
,
Sir
Pitt
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
a
husband
who
possess
your
intellect
as
he
do
your
name
,
I
sometimes
think
I
should
not
be
unworthy
of
him
 
<EOS>
but
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
your
kinswoman
now
,
"
she

with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
poor
little
penniless
,
I
have
get
a
little
interest
 
and
who
know
,
perhaps
the
mouse
may
be
able
to
aid
the
lion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pitt
Crawley
be
amazed
and
enrapture
with
her
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
that
woman
comprehend
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
could
get
Jane
to
read
three
page
of
the
malt
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
idea
that
I
have
command
talent
or
secret
ambition
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
remember
my
speaking
at
Oxford
,
do
they
?
<EOS>
the
rascal
!
 
<EOS>
now
that
I
represent
my
borough
and
may
sit
for
the
county
,
they
begin
to
recollect
me
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
Lord
Steyne
cut
me
at
the
levee
last
year
;
they
be
begin
to
find
out
that
Pitt
Crawley
be
some
one
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
the
man
be
always
the
same
whom
these
people
neglect
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
the
opportunity
that
be
want
,
and
I
will
show
them
now
that
I
can
speak
and
act
as
well
as
write
.
<EOS>
achille
do
not
declare
himself
until
they
give
him
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
it
now
,
and
the
world
shall
yet
hear
of
Pitt
Crawley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
therefore
it
be
that
this
roguish
diplomatist
have
grow
so
hospitable
;
that
he
be
so
civil
to
oratorio
and
hospital
;
so
kind
to
Deans
and
chapter
;
so
generous
in
give
and
accept
dinner
;
so
uncommonly
gracious
to
farmer
on
market
-
day
;
and
so
much
interested
about
county
business
;
and
that
the
Christmas
at
the
Hall
be
the
gay
which
have
be
know
there
for
many
a
long
day
.
  
<EOS>
on
Christmas
Day
a
great
family
gathering
take
place
.
<EOS>
all
the
Crawleys
from
the
Rectory
come
to
dine
.
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
be
as
frank
and
fond
of
Mrs.
Bute
as
if
the
other
have
never
be
her
enemy
;
she
be
affectionately
interested
in
the
dear
girl
,
and
surprise
at
the
progress
which
they
have
make
in
music
since
her
time
,
and
insist
upon
encore
one
of
the
duet
out
of
the
great
song
-
book
which
Jim
,
grumble
,
have
be
force
to
bring
under
his
arm
from
the
Rectory
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bute
,
perforce
,
be
oblige
to
adopt
a
decent
demeanour
towards
the
little
adventuress
 
of
course
be
free
to
discourse
with
her
daughter
afterwards
about
the
absurd
respect
with
which
Sir
Pitt
treat
his
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
but
Jim
,
who
have
sit
next
to
her
at
dinner
,
declare
she
be
a
trump
,
and
one
and
all
of
the
rector
's
family
agree
that
the
little
Rawdon
be
a
fine
boy
.
<EOS>
They
respect
a
possible
baronet
in
the
boy
,
between
whom
and
the
title
there
be
only
the
little
sickly
pale
Pitt
Binkie
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
be
very
good
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Pitt
Binkie
be
too
little
a
dog
for
such
a
big
dog
as
Rawdon
to
play
with
;
and
Matilda
be
only
a
girl
,
of
course
not
fit
companion
for
a
young
gentleman
who
be
near
eight
year
old
,
and
go
into
jacket
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
command
of
this
small
party
at
once
 
the
little
girl
and
the
little
boy
follow
him
about
with
great
reverence
at
such
time
as
he
condescend
to
sport
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
happiness
and
pleasure
in
the
country
be
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
the
kitchen
garden
please
him
hugely
,
the
flower
moderately
,
but
the
pigeon
and
the
poultry
,
and
the
stable
when
he
be
allow
to
visit
them
,
be
delightful
object
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
resist
be
kiss
by
the
Misses
Crawley
,
but
he
allow
Lady
Jane
sometimes
to
embrace
him
,
and
it
be
by
her
side
that
he
like
to
sit
when
,
the
signal
to
retire
to
the
drawing
-
room
be
give
,
the
lady
leave
the
gentleman
to
their
claret
 
by
her
side
rather
than
by
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
for
Rebecca
,
see
that
tenderness
be
the
fashion
,
call
Rawdon
to
her
one
evening
and
stoop
down
and
kiss
him
in
the
presence
of
all
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
her
full
in
the
face
after
the
operation
,
tremble
and
turn
very
red
,
as
his
will
not
be
when
move
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
never
kiss
me
at
home
,
Mamma
,
"
he
say
,
at
which
there
be
a
general
silence
and
consternation
and
a
by
no
means
pleasant
look
in
Becky
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Rawdon
be
fond
of
his
sister
-
in
-
law
,
for
her
regard
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
Lady
Jane
and
Becky
do
not
get
on
quite
so
well
at
this
visit
as
on
occasion
of
the
former
one
,
when
the
Colonel
's
wife
be
bent
upon
pleasing
.
 
<EOS>
those
two
speech
of
the
child
strike
rather
a
chill
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Sir
Pitt
be
rather
too
attentive
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
Rawdon
,
as
become
his
age
and
size
<EOS>
,
be
fonder
of
the
society
of
the
man
than
of
the
woman
,
and
never
weary
of
accompany
his
sire
to
the
stable
,
whither
the
Colonel
retire
to
smoke
his
cigar
 
Jim
,
the
rector
's
son
,
sometimes
join
his
cousin
in
that
and
other
amusement
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
Baronet
's
keeper
be
very
close
friend
,
their
mutual
taste
for
"
dawgs
"
bring
them
much
together

on

and
intense
application
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
make
acquaintance
with
the
minister
,
and
the
chiefs
of
his
party
,
determine
to
rank
as
one
of
them
before
many
year
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Jane
's
sweetness
and
kindness
have
inspire
Rebecca
with
such
a
contempt
for
her
ladyship
as
the
little
woman
find
no
small
difficulty
in
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
that
sort
of
goodness
and
simplicity
which
Lady
Jane
possess
annoy
our
friend
Becky
,
and
it
be
impossible
for
her
at
time
not
to
show
,
or
to
let
the
other
divine
,
her
scorn
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
,
too
,
render
Lady
Jane
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
talk
constantly
with
Becky
.
 
<EOS>
sign
of
intelligence
seem
to
pass
between
them
,
and
Pitt
speak
with
her
on
subject
on
which
he
never
think
of
discourse
with
Lady
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
do
not
understand
them
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
be
mortify
to
remain
silent
;
still
more
mortifying
to
know
that
you
have
nothing
to
say
,
and
hear
that
little
audacious
Mrs.
Rawdon
dash
on
from
subject
to
subject
,
with
a
word
for
every
man
,
and
a
joke
always
pat
;
and
to
sit
in
one
's
own
house
alone
,
by
the
fireside
,
and
watch
all
the
man
round
your
rival
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
country
,
when
Lady
Jane
be
tell
story
to
the
child
,
who
cluster
about
her
knee
(
little
Rawdon
into
the
bargain
,
who
be
very
fond
of
her
)
,
and
Becky
come
into
the
room
,
sneer
with
green
scornful
eye
,
poor
Lady
Jane
grow
silent
under
those
baleful
glance
.
<EOS>
Her
simple
little
fancy
shrink
away
tremulously
,
as
fairy
in
the
story
-
book
,
before
a
superior
bad
angel
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
go
on
,
although
Rebecca
,
with
the
small
inflection
of
sarcasm
in
her
voice
,
besought
her
to
continue
that
charm
story
.
 
<EOS>
and
on
her
side
gentle
thought
and
simple
pleasure
be
odious
to
Mrs.
Becky
;
they
discord
with
her
;
she
hate
people
for
like
them
;
she
spurn
child
and
child
-
lover
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
taste
for
bread
and
butter
,
"
she
would
say
,
when
caricature
Lady
Jane
and
her
way
to
my
Lord
Steyne
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
more
have
a
certain
person
for
holy
water
,
"
his
lordship
reply
with
a
bow
and
a
grin
and
a
great
jarring
laugh
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
so
these
two
lady
do
not
see
much
of
each
other
except
upon
those
occasion
when
the
young
brother
's
wife
,
have
an
object
to
gain
from
the
other
,
frequent
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
my
-
loved
and
my
-
deare
each
other
assiduously
,
but
keep
apart
generally
,
whereas
Sir
Pitt
,
in
the
midst
of
his
multiplied
avocation
,
find
daily
time
to
see
his
sister
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
Speaker
's
dinner
,
Sir
Pitt
take
the
opportunity
of
appear
before
his
sister
-
in
-
law
in
his
uniform
 
that
old
diplomatic
suit
which
he
have
wear
<EOS>
when
attache
to
the
Pumpernickel
legation
.
  
<EOS>
Becky
compliment
him
upon
that
dress
and
admire
him
almost
as
much
as
his
own
wife
and
child
,
to
whom
he
display
himself
before
he
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
that
it
be
only
the
thoroughbred
gentleman
who
could
wear
the
Court
suit
with
advantage
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
your
man
of
ancient
race
whom
the
culotte
courte
become
.
 
<EOS>
Pitt
look
down
with
complacency
at
his
leg
,
which
have
not
,
in
truth
,
much
more
symmetry
or
swell
than
the
lean
Court
sword
which
dangle
by
his
side
 
look
down
at
his
leg
,
and
think
in
his
heart
that
he
be
kill
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
Mrs.
Becky
make
a
caricature
of
his
figure
,
which
she
show
to
Lord
Steyne
when
he
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
His
lordship
carry
off
the
sketch
,
delight
with
the
accuracy
of
the
resemblance
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
do
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
the
honour
to
meet
him
at
Mrs.
Becky
's
house
and
have
be
most
gracious
to
the
new
Baronet
and
member
.
 
<EOS>
Pitt
be
strike
too
by
the
deference
with
which
the
great
Peer
treat
his
sister
-
in
-
law
,
by
her
ease
and
sprightliness
in
the
conversation
,
and
by
the
delight
with
which
the
other
man
of
the
party
listen
to
her
talk
.
<EOS>
Lord
Steyne
make
no
doubt
but
that
the
Baronet
have
only
commence
his
career
in
public
life
,
and
expect
rather
anxiously
to
hear
him
as
an
orator
;
as
they
be
neighbour
(
for
Great
Gaunt
Street
lead
into
Gaunt
Square
,
whereof
Gaunt
House
,
as
everybody
know
,
form
one
side
)
<EOS>
my
lord
hope
that
as
soon
as
Lady
Steyne
arrive
in
London
she
would
have
the
honour
of
make
the
acquaintance
of
Lady
Crawley

He

though
they
have

<EOS>
in
the

these

fine

brilliant

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
the

He

<EOS>
out
of
the
small
residue

which
Amelia
keep
back
for

,
the

have
need
of
all
the
thrift

care
possible
in

enable

keep
her

boy

to

secret

<EOS>
She

book
in
order
to
teach
them
to
Georgy
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
work
even
at
the
latin
accidence
,
fondly
hope
that
she
may
be
capable
of
instruct
him
in
that
language
.
 
<EOS>
to
part
with
him
all
day
,
to
send
him
out
to
the
mercy
of
a
schoolmaster
's
cane
and
his
schoolfellow
'
roughness
,
be
almost
like
wean
him
over
again
to
that
weak
mother
,
so
tremulous

full
of
sensibility

<EOS>
He
,
for
his

rush
off
to
the

with
the
utmost
happiness

<EOS>
He
be
long
for
the
change
.
<EOS>
that
childish
gladness
wound
his
mother
,
who
be
herself
<EOS>
so
grieve
to
part
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
rather
have
have
him
more
sorry
,
she
think
,
and
then
be
deeply
repentant
within
herself
for
dare
to
be
so
selfish
as
to
wish
her
own
son
to
be
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
Georgy
make
great
progress
in
the
school
,
which
be
keep
by
a
friend
of
his
mother
's
constant
admirer
,
the
Rev.
Mr.
Binny
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
home
numberless
prize
and
testimonial
of
ability
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
his
mother
countless
story
every
night
about
his
school
-
companion
:
and
what
a
fine
fellow
lyon
be
,
and
what
a
sneak
Sniffin
be
,
and
how
Steel
's
father
actually
supply
the
meat
for
the
establishment
,
whereas
Golding
's
mother
come
in
a
carriage
to
fetch
him
every
Saturday
,
and
how
Neat
have
strap
to
his
trowser
 
<EOS>
may
he
have
strap
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
Bull
Major
be
so
strong
(
though
only
in
Eutropius
)
<EOS>
that
it
be
believe
he
could
lick
the
Usher
,
Mr.
Ward
,
himself
.
 
<EOS>
so
Amelia
learn
to
know
every
one
of
the
boy
in
that
school
as
well
as
Georgy
himself
,
and
of
night
she
use
to
help
him
in
his
exercise
and
puzzle
her
little
head
over
his
lesson
as
eagerly
as
if
she
be
herself
go
in
the
morning
into
the
presence
of
the
master
.
<EOS>
once
,
after
a
certain
combat
with
Master
Smith
,
George
come
home
to
his
mother
with
a
black
eye
,
and
brag
prodigiously
to
his
parent
and
his
delighted
old
grandfather
about
his
valour
in
the
fight
,
in
which
,
if
the
truth
be
know
he
do
not
behave
with
particular
heroism
,
and
in
which
he
decidedly
have
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
but
Amelia
have
never
forgive
that
Smith
to
this
day
,
though
he
be
now
a
peaceful
apothecary
near
Leicester
Square
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
quiet
labour
and
harmless
care
the
gentle
widow
's
life
be
pass
away
,
a
silver
hair
or
two
mark
the
progress
of
time
on
her
head
and
a
line
deepen
ever
so
little
on
her
fair
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
She
use
to
smile
at
these
mark
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
matter
it
,
"
she
ask
,
"
for
an
old
woman
like
me

<EOS>
"
all
she
hope
for
be
to
live
to
see
her
son
great
,
famous
,
and
glorious
,
as
he
deserve
to
be

<EOS>
She
keep
his
copy

book
,
his
drawing
,
and
composition
,
and
show
them
about
in
her
little
circle
as
if
they
be
miracle
of
genius

<EOS>
She
confide
some
of
these
specimen
to
Miss
Dobbin
,
to
show
them
to
Miss
Osborne
,
George
's
aunt
,
to
show
them
to
Mr.
Osborne
himself
 
to
make
that
old
man
repent
of
his
cruelty
and
ill
feeling
towards
him
who
be
go

<EOS>
all
her
husband
's
fault
and
foible
she
have
bury
in
the
grave
with
him
<EOS>
:
she
only
remember
the
lover
,
who
have
marry
her
at
all

the
noble
husband

so
brave

in

on
the
morning
when
he

<EOS>
from

the

be
smile
down
upon
that
paragon
of
a
boy
whom
he
have
leave
to
comfort

console
her

<EOS>
We
have
see
how
one
of
George

grandfather
(
Mr.
Osborne
)
,
in
his
easy
chair
in
Russell
Square
,
daily
grow
more
violent

moody

and
how
his

and
her
fine
horse

and
her
name
on
half
the
public

miserable

persecute
old

<EOS>
She

with

and
do
you
suppose

of
that
family

who
be
as
proud
as
the
Bourbons
,
and
to
whom
the
Steynes
be

lackey
,
mushroom
of

(
for
after

they

not
of

of
a
minor

doubtful
branch

<EOS>
;
do
you
suppose
,
I
say
(
the
reader
must
bear
in
mind
that
it
be
always
Tom
Eaves

speak

that
the
Marchioness

the
haughtiest
woman
in

would
bend
down
to
her
husband
so
submissively
if
there

not
some
cause

<EOS>
pooh
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
there
be
secret
reason
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
,
in

the
Abbe
de

Marche
who
be

86
 
<EOS>
that
he

again
 
that
it

be
shoot
in

that
Lady
Steyne
take
to
those
extreme
practice
of
devotion
which
she
carry
on
now

for
she
be
closet
with
her
director
every

<EOS>
she
be
at
service
at
Spanish

<EOS>
every

,
I
have
watch
her
there
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
I
have
happen
to
be
pass
there
 
and
depend
on
it
,
there
be
a
mystery
in
her
case

<EOS>
People
be
not
so
unhappy
unless
they
have
something
to
repent
of
,
"
add
Tom
Eaves
with
a
know
wag
of
his
head
;
"
and
depend
on
it
,
that
woman
would
not
be
so
submissive
as
she
be
if
the
Marquis
have
not
some
sword
to
hold
over
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
if
Mr.
Eaves
's
information
be
correct
,
it
be
very
likely
that
this
lady
,
in
her
high
station

have
to
submit
to
many
a
private
indignity

to
hide
many
secret

console
ourselves

think
comfortably
how
miserable

and
that
Damocles

have
an
awful
sword
hang
over

or
a

secret

which
peep
out
every

then
from

<EOS>
in

(
always

another

You

may
be
on
good

whereas
the

such

must
naturally
be
angry
at
be
keep
out

eye
the

<EOS>

this

Shakespeare

my

when

try
on
his

give

<EOS>
and
it
stand
to
reason

this

must
be
aware

entertain
it

then
again

My

so
much
ready
money
which
ought
to
be
his

right

<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
<EOS>
George
Mac
Turk
,
Lord
Bajazet
's
eld
son
,
say
that
if
he
have
his
will
when
he
come
to
the
title
,
he
would
do
what
the
sultan
do
,
and
clear
the
estate
by
chop
off
all
his
young
brother
'
head
at
once
;
and
so
the
case
be
,
more
or
less
,
with
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
they
be
all
Turks
in
their
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Pooh
!
<EOS>
sir
,
they
know
the
world
.
"
<EOS>
and
here
,
haply
,
a
great
man
come
up
,
Tom
Eaves
's
hat
would
drop
off
his
head
,
and
he
would
rush
forward
with
a
bow
and
a
grin
,
which
show
that
he
know
the
world
too
 
in
the
tomeavesian
way
,
that
be
.
 
<EOS>
and
have
lay
out
every
shilling
of
his
fortune
on
an
annuity
,
Tom
could
afford
to
bear
no
malice
to
his
nephew
and
niece
,
and
to
have
no
other
feeling
with
regard
to
his
better
but
a
constant
and
generous
desire
to
dine
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
between
the
Marchioness
and
the
natural
and
tender
regard
of
mother
for
child
,
there
be
that
cruel
barrier
place
of
difference
of
faith
.
<EOS>
the
very
love
which
she
may
feel
for
her
son
only
serve
to
render
the
timid
and
pious
lady
more
fearful
and
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
the
gulf
which
separate
them
be
fatal
and
impassable
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
stretch
her
weak
arm
across
it
,
or
draw
her
child
over
to
that
side
away
from
which
her
belief
tell
her
there
be
no
safety
.
<EOS>
during
the
youth
of
his
son
,
Lord
Steyne
,
who
be
a
good
scholar
and
amateur
casuist
,
have
no
well
sport
in
the
evening
after
dinner
in
the
country
than
in

the
boy

the
Reverend
Mr.
Trail

now
my
Lord

Father
Mole

<EOS>
He

"
Bravo

<EOS>
alternately

he
promise
Mole
a
bishopric
if
he
would
come
over
,
and
vow
he
would
use
all
his
influence
to
get
Trail
a

hat
if
he
would
secede
.
 
<EOS>
neither
divine
allow
himself

be

though
the
fond

hope
that
her
young

his

My

He

fine
waltzer
in

<EOS>
with
these
talent

and
his
interest
at

there
be
little
doubt
that
his

would
rise
to
the

the

<EOS>
It

It

His

Lord

"
these
be
the
kind

epitaph
which
man
pass
over
one
another
in
Vanity
Fair

<EOS>
twice
or
thrice
in
a
week
,
in
the
early
morning
,
the
poor
mother
go
for
her
sin
and
see
the
poor
invalid
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
laugh
at
her
(
and
his
laughter
be
more
pitiful
than
to
hear
him
cry
)
;
sometimes
she
find
the
brilliant
dandy
diplomatist
of
the
Congress
of
Vienna
drag
about
a
child
's
toy
,
or
nurse
the
keeper
's
baby
's
doll
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
know
her
and
Father
Mole
,
her
director
and
companion
;
oftener
he
forget
her
,
as
he
have
do
wife
,
child
,
love
,
ambition
,
vanity
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
remember
his
dinner
-
hour
,
and
use
to
cry
if
his
wine
-
and
-
water
be
not
strong
enough
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
mysterious
taint
of
the
blood
;
the
poor
mother
have
bring
it
from
her
own
ancient
race
.
 
<EOS>
the
evil
have
break
out
once
or
twice
in
the
father

family
,
long
before
Lady
Steyne

sin
have
begin

or
her
fast

tear
and
penance
have

offer
in
their
expiation

<EOS>
the
pride
of
the
race
be
strike
down
as
the
first

bear
of
Pharaoh

<EOS>
the
dark
mark
of
fate
and
doom
be
on
the
threshold
 
<EOS>
the
tall
old
threshold
surmount
by
coronet
and
cane
heraldry
.
  
<EOS>
the
absent
lord
's
child
meanwhile
prattle
and
grow
on
quite
unconscious
that
the
doom
be
over
them
too
.
 
<EOS>
first
they
talk
of
their
father
and
devise
plan
against
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
name
of
the
live
dead
man
be
less
frequently
in
their
mouth
 
then
not
mention
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
stricken
old
grandmother
tremble
to
think
that
these
too
be
the
inheritor
of
their
father
's
shame
as
well
as
of
his
honour
,
and
watch
sickening
for
the
day
when
the
awful
ancestral
curse
should
come
down
on
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
dark
presentiment
also
haunt
Lord
Steyne
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
lay
the
horrid
bedside
ghost
in
Red
Seas
of
wine
and
jollity
,
and
lose
sight
of
it
sometimes
in
the
crowd
and
rout
of
his
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
always
come
back
to
him
when
alone
,
and
seem
to
grow
more
threatening
with
year
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
take
your
son
,
"
it
say
,
"
why
not
you
?
<EOS>
I
may
shut
you
up
in
a
prison
some
day
like
your
son
George

<EOS>
I
may
tap
you
on

away
go
pleasure

honour
,
feast

beauty
,
friend

flatterer

french

fine
horse
and
house
 
in
exchange
for
a
prison
,
a
keeper
,
and
a
straw
mattress
like
George
Gaunt
's
.
<EOS>
"
and
then
my
lord
would
defy
the
ghost
which
threaten
him
,
for
he
know
of
a
remedy
by
which
he
could
baulk
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
so
there
be
splendour
and
wealth
,
but
no
great
happiness
perchance
,
behind
the
tall
caned
portal
of
Gaunt
House
with
its
smoky
coronet
and
cipher
.
 
<EOS>
the
feast
there
be
of

grand
in

there
be
not

have
he
not

so
great
<EOS>
a

<EOS>
some
notorious
carper

squeamish
moralist
may
be
sulky
with
Lord

but
they
be
glad

"

you

Becky

kindness

attention

the
chief

destine

an
exceed
great
reward

a
reward
which
,
though
certainly
somewhat
unsubstantial

the
little

covet
with
great
eagerness
than
more
positive
benefit

<EOS>
if
she
do
not
wish
to
lead
a
virtuous
life

at
least
she
desire
to
enjoy
a
character
for
virtue
,
and
we
know
that
no
lady
in
the
genteel
world
can
possess
this
desideratum
,
until
she
have
put
on
a
train
and
feather
and
have
be
present
to
her
Sovereign
at
Court
.
<EOS>
from
that
august
interview
they
come
out
stamp
as
honest
woman
.
<EOS>
the
Lord
Chamberlain
give
them
a
certificate
of
virtue

<EOS>
and
as
dubious
good
or
letter
be
pass
through
an
oven
at
quarantine
,
sprinkle
with
aromatic
vinegar

and
then
pronounce
clean

many
a
lady

whose
reputation
would
be
doubtful
otherwise

liable
to
give
infection
,
<EOS>
pass
through
the
wholesome
ordeal
of
the
royal
presence

issue
from
it
free
from
all
taint

<EOS>
It
may
be
very
well
for
my
Lady
Bareacres
,
my
Lady
Tufto
,
Mrs.
Bute
Crawley
in

country

and
other
lady
who
have

Crawley
to
cry
fie
at
the
idea
of
the
odious
little
adventuress
make
her
curtsey
before
the
Sovereign

and
to
declare
that
,
if
dear
good
Queen
Charlotte
have
be
alive

she
never
would
have
admit
such
an
extremely
ill

regulated
personage
into

when
we
consider
that
it

Mrs.

pass
her
examination
,

as
it

take
her

it
surely
must

flat
disloyalty

any

I
,
for

look

Great

ah

her

<EOS>
on
the

<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
,
in
a
glitter
uniform

descend
and
go
into
Curzon

<EOS>
Little
Rawdon

against
the
parlour
window

pane
,
smiling
and
nod
with
all
his
might
to
his
aunt
in
the
carriage
within
;
and
presently
Sir
Pitt
issue
forth
from
the
house
again
,
lead
forth
a
lady
with
grand
feather
,
cover
in
a
white
shawl
,
and
hold
up
daintily
a
train
of
magnificent
brocade
.
 
<EOS>
She
step
into
the
vehicle
as
if
she
be
a
princess
and
accustom
all
her
life
to
go
to
Court
,
smile
graciously
on
the
footman
at
the
door
and
on
Sir
Pitt
,
who
follow
her
into
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
then
Rawdon
follow
in
his
old
Guards
'
uniform
,
which
have
grow
woefully
shabby
,
and
be
much
too
tight
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
to
have
follow
the
procession
and
wait
upon
his
sovereign
in
a
cab
,
but
that
his
good
-
natured
sister
-
in
-
law
insist
that
they
should
be
a
family
party
.
<EOS>
the
coach
be
large
,
the
lady
not
very
big
,
they
would
hold
their
train
in
their
lap
 
finally
,
the
four
go
fraternally
together
,
and
their
carriage
presently
join
the
line
of
royal
equipage
which
be
make
its
way
down
Piccadilly
<EOS>
and
St.
 
James

Street
,
towards
the
old
brick
palace
where
the
Star
of
Brunswick
be
in
wait
to
receive
his
noble
and
gentlefolk
.
  
<EOS>
Becky
feel
as
if
she
could
bless
the
people
out
of
the
carriage
window
<EOS>
,
so
elated
be
she
in
spirit
,
and
so
strong
a
sense
<EOS>
have
she
of
the
dignified
position
which
she
have
at
last
attain
in
life
.
<EOS>
even
our
Becky
have
her
weakness
,
and
as
one
often
see
how
man
pride
themselves
upon
excellence
which
other
be
slow
to
perceive
:
how
,
for
instance
,
Comus
firmly
believe
that
he
be
the
great
tragic
actor
in
England
;
how
Brown
,
the
famous
novelist
,
long
to
be
consider
,
not
a
man
of
genius
,
but
a
man
of
fashion
;
while
Robinson
,
the
great
lawyer
,
do
not
in
the
least
care
about
his
reputation
in
Westminster
Hall
,
but
believe
himself
incomparable
across
country
and
at
a
five
-
bar
gate
 
so
to
be
,
and
to
be
think
,
a
respectable
woman
be
Becky
's
aim
in
life
,
and
she
get
up
the
genteel
with
amazing
assiduity
,
readiness
,
and
success
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
say
,
there
be
time
when
she
believe
herself
to
be
a
fine
lady
and
forget
that
there
be
no
money
in
the
chest
at
home
 
<EOS>
dun
round
the
gate
,
tradesman
to
coax
and
wheedle
 
no
ground
to
walk
upon
,
in
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
she
go
to
Court
in
the
carriage
,
the
family
carriage
,
she
adopt
a
demeanour
<EOS>
so
grand
,
self
-
satisfied
,
deliberate
,
and
impose
that
it
make
even
Lady
Jane
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
She
walk
into
the
royal
apartment
with
a
toss
of
the
head
which
would
have
befit
an
empress
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
have
she
be
one
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
become
the
character
perfectly
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
authorize
to
state
that
Mrs.
Rawdon
Crawley
's
costume
de
cour
on
the
occasion
of
her
presentation
to
the
Sovereign
be
of
the
most
elegant
and
brilliant
description
.
 
<EOS>
some
lady
we
may
have
see
 
we
who
wear
star
and
cordon
and
attend
the
St.
 
James
's
assembly
,
or
we
,
who
,
in
muddy
boot
,
dawdle
up
and
down
Pall
Mall
and
peep
into
the
coach
as
they
drive
up
with
the
great
folk
in
their
feather
 
some
lady
of
fashion
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
we
may
have
see
,
about
two
o'clock
of
the
forenoon
of
a
levee
day
,
as
the
laced
-
jacket
band
of
the
Life
Guards
be
blow
triumphal
marche
seat
on
those
prance

their
cream

who
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
lovely
and
enticing
object
at
that
early
period
of
noon
.
 
<EOS>
a
stout
countess
of
sixty

decolletee
,
paint
,
wrinkle
with
rouge
up
to
her
drooping
eyelid
,
and
diamond
twinkle
in
her
wig
,
be
a
wholesome
and
edifying
,
but
not
a
pleasant
sight
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
the
faded
look
of
a
St.
 
James
's
Street
illumination
,
as
it
may
be
see
of
an
early
morning
,
when
half
the
lamp
be
out
,
and
the
other
be
blink
wanly
,
as
if
they
be
about
to
vanish
like
ghost
before
the
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
such
charm
as
those
of
which
we
catch
glimpse
while
her
ladyship
's
carriage
pass
should
appear
abroad
at
night
alone
.
 
<EOS>
if
even
Cynthia
look
haggard
of
an
afternoon

as
we
may
see
her
sometimes
in
the
present
winter
season
,
with
Phoebus
stare
her
out
of
countenance
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
heavens
,
how
much
more
<EOS>
can
old
Lady
Castlemouldy
keep
her
head
up
when
the
sun
be
shine
full
upon
it
through
the
chariot
window
,
and
show
all
the
chink

cranny
with
which

mark
her

should
be

for
November

or
the
first
foggy

or
the
elderly
sultanas
of

Vanity
Fair
should
drive
up
in
closed
litter
,
descend
in
a
covered
way
,
and
make
their
curtsey
to
the
Sovereign
under
the
protection

<EOS>
Our
beloved
Rebecca
have
no
need
,
however
,
of
any
such
a
friendly
halo
to
set
off
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Her
complexion
could
bear
any
sunshine
as
yet
,
and
her
dress
,
though
if
you
be
to
see
it
now
,
any
present
lady
of
Vanity
Fair
would
pronounce
it
to
be
the
most
foolish
and
preposterous
attire
ever
wear
,
be
as
handsome
in
her
eye
and
<EOS>
those
of
the
public
,
some
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
since
,
as
the
most
brilliant
costume
of
the
most
famous
beauty
of
the
present
season
.
<EOS>
a
score
of
year
hence
that
too
,
that
milliner
's
wonder
,
will
have
pass
into
the
domain
of
the
absurd
,
along
with
all
previous
vanity
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
be
wander
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rawdon
's
dress
be
pronounce
to
be
charmante
on
the
eventful
day
of
her
presentation
.
<EOS>
even
good
little
Lady
Jane
be
force
to
acknowledge
this
effect
,
as
she
look
at
her
kinswoman
,
and
own
sorrowfully
to
herself
that
she
be
quite
inferior
in
taste
to
Mrs.
Becky
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
how
much
care
,
think
,
and
genius
Mrs.
Rawdon
have
bestow
upon
that
garment
.
 
<EOS>
Rebecca
have
as
good
taste
as
any
milliner
in
Europe
,
and
such
a
clever
way
of
do
thing
as
Lady
Jane
little
understand
.
<EOS>
the
latter
quickly
spy
out
the
magnificence
of
the
brocade
of
Becky
's
train
,
and
the
splendour
of
the
lace
on
her
dress
.
  
<EOS>
the
brocade
be
an
old
remnant
,
Becky
say
;
and
as
for
the
lace
,
it
be
a
great
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
have
it
these
hundred
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Crawley
,
it
must
have
cost
a
little
fortune
,
"
Lady
Jane
say
,
look
down
at
her
own
lace
,
which
be
not
nearly
so
good
;
and
then
examine
the
quality
of
the
ancient
brocade
which
form
the
material
of
Mrs.
Rawdon
's
Court
dress
,
she
feel
inclined
to
say
that
she
could
not
afford
such
fine
clothing
,
but
check
that
speech
,
with
an
effort
,
as
one
uncharitable
to
her
kinswoman
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
if
Lady
Jane
have
know
all
,
I
think
even
her
kindly
temper
would
have
fail
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
when
she
be
put
Sir
Pitt
's
house
in
order
,
Mrs.
Rawdon
have
find
the
lace
and
the
brocade
in
old
wardrobe
,
the
property
of
the
former
lady
of
the
house
,
and
have
quietly
carry
the
good
home
,
and
have
suit
them
to
her
own
little
person
.
 
<EOS>
Briggs
see
her
take
them
,
ask
no
question
,
tell
no
story
;
but
I
believe
quite
sympathise
with
her
on
this
matter
,
and
so
would
many
another
honest
woman
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
diamond
 
"
where
the
doose
do
you
get
the
diamond
,
Becky
?
"
say
her
husband
,
admire
some
jewel
which
he
have
never
see
before
and
which
sparkle
in
her
ear
and
on
her
neck
with
brilliance
and
profusion
.
  
<EOS>
Becky
blush
a
little
and
look
at
him
hard
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Pitt
Crawley
blush
a
little
too
,
and
look
out
of
window
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
he
have
give
her
a
very
small
portion
of
the
brilliant
;
a
pretty
diamond
clasp
,
which
confine
a
pearl
necklace
which
she
wear
 
and
the
Baronet
have
omit
to
mention
the
circumstance
to
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Becky
look
at
her
husband
,
and
then
at
Sir
Pitt
,
with
an
air
of
saucy
triumph
 
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
betray
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
guess
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
silly
man
,
"
she
continue
,
"
where
do
you
suppose
I
get
them
?
 
<EOS>
all
except
the
little
clasp
,
which
a
dear
friend
of
mine
give
me
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
hire
them
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
hire
them
at
Mr.
Polonius
's
,
in
Coventry
Street
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
suppose
that
all
the
diamond
which
go
to
Court
belong
to
the
wearer
;
like
those
beautiful
stone
which
Lady
Jane
have
,
and
which
be
much
handsome
than
<EOS>
any
which
I
have
,
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
family
jewel
,
"
say
Sir
Pitt
,
again
look
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
this
family
conversation
the
carriage
roll
down
the
street
,
until
its
cargo
be
finally
discharge
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
where
the
Sovereign
be
sit
in
state
.
  
<EOS>
the
diamond
,
which
have
create
Rawdon
's
admiration
,
never
go
back
to
Mr.
Polonius
,
of
Coventry
Street
,
and
that
gentleman
never
apply
for
their
restoration
,
but
they
retire
into
a
little
private
repository
,
in
an
old
desk
,
which
Amelia
Sedley
have
give
her
year
and
year
ago
,
and
in
which
Becky
keep
a
number
of
useful
and
,
perhaps
,
valuable
thing
,
about
which
her
husband
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
to
know
nothing
,
or
little
,
be
in
the
nature
of
some
husband
.
 
<EOS>
to
hide
,
in
the
nature
of
how
many
woman
?
<EOS>
oh
,
lady
!
<EOS>
how
many
of
you
have
surreptitious
milliner

bill
?
<EOS>
how
many
of
you
have
gown
and
bracelet
which
you
dare
not
show
,
or
which
you
wear
tremble
?
 
<EOS>
tremble
,
and
coax
with
smile
the
husband
by
your
side
,
who
do
not
know
the
new
velvet
gown
from
the
old
one
,
or
the
new
bracelet
from
last
year
's
,
or
have
any
notion
that
the
ragged

look
yellow
lace
scarf
cost
forty
guinea
and
that
Madame
Bobinot
be
write
dun
letter
every
week
for
the
money
!
  
<EOS>
thus
Rawdon
know
nothing
about
the
brilliant
diamond
ear
-
ring
,
or
the
superb
brilliant
ornament
which
decorate
the
fair
bosom
of
his
lady
;
but
Lord
Steyne
,
who
be
in
his
place
at

<EOS>
as
he
bow
over
her
he
smile

quote
the
hackneyed

beautiful
line
from
the
Rape

about

it

relate

<EOS>
the

close
before
that
Magnificent
Idea

<EOS>
loyal
respect

decency
tell
even
the

not

look
too
keenly

audaciously
about
the

to
back
away
rapidly

silently
,

respectfully
,
make
profound
bow
out
of
the
August
Presence
.
  
<EOS>
this
may
be
say
,
that
in
all
London
there
be
no
more
loyal
heart
than
Becky
's
after
this
interview
.
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
her

always
on
her
lip

he

charming

She
go

<EOS>
She
have

and
wear
it
 
indeed
she
amuse
and
somewhat
pester
her
acquaintance
with
her
perpetual
talk
about
his
urbanity
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
who
know
!
 
<EOS>
perhaps
the
little
woman
think
she
may
play
the
part
of
a
Maintenon
or
a
Pompadour
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
fine
sport
of
all
after
her
presentation
be
to
hear
her
talk
virtuously
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
few
female
acquaintance
,
not

it
must
be
own

of
the

Lord

bite
his
nail

at
last
he
clap

She

It

He

<EOS>
the

which

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
although
Colonel
Crawley
be
now
five
-
and

forty
year
of
age
,
it
have
not
be
his
lot

<EOS>
indeed
Becky

but
that
virtue
ordain
that
her
husband
should
be
by
her
side
to
protect
the
timid

little

<EOS>
Becky
take
it

however

with

the
Lady
Bareacres
and
the
young

find
,
to
their
farth
mortification
,
that
Mrs.

be
much
better
acquaint

and
speak
it
with
a
much
well
accent
than

<EOS>
Becky

<EOS>
and
then

of
Lord

She

and
sad
,
fix
upon
her
child

whereof
the
little
boy
can
not
interpret
the
expression

<EOS>
She
start
up
of
a
night
and
peep
into
his
room
stealthily
,
to
see
that
he

She

<EOS>
a
constant
thought
and
terror

haunt
her

<EOS>
how
she
weep
and
pray
in
the
long
silent
night
 
<EOS>
how
she
try
to
hide
from
herself
the
thought
which
will
return
to
her

that
she
ought
to
part
with
the
boy

that
she
be
the
only
barrier

She

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>

too
hard
to

<EOS>
a
thought
come
over
her
which
make
her
blush
and
turn
from

<EOS>

keep
the
annuity
 
the

but
George

rebuke
her

<EOS>
Shame
and
love
say
no
to
the

<EOS>
She
shrink
from
it
as
from
something
unholy

and
such
thought
never
find
a
resting

place
in
that
pure
and
gentle

at

to
her

he

artless
pathos
their
lonely
and
hapless
condition

<EOS>
She

She

She

He
could
not

when
he

<EOS>
then
the

He

"

She

She

Her

not
suffice
to
give
George
the
advantage
which

Miss
Osborne
,
on
the
other
hand
,
thought
of
old
time
and
memory
and
could
not
but
be
touch
with
the
poor
mother
's
pitiful
situation
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
conquer

and
lay
down
her
arm
,
as
it
be
,
she
humbly
submit
.
 
<EOS>
that
day
they
arrange
together
the
preliminary
of
the
treaty
of
capitulation
.
  
<EOS>
George

school
the
next
day
,
and
see
his
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
leave
them
alone
together
and
go
to
her
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
try
the
separation
 
as
that
poor
gentle
Lady
Jane
Grey
feel
the
edge
of
the
axe
that
be
to
come
down
and
sever
her
slender
life
.
 
<EOS>
day
be
pass
in
parley
,
visit
,
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
the
widow
break
the
matter
to
Georgy
with
great
caution
;
she
look
to
see
him
very
much
affect
by
the
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
elated
than
otherwise
,
and
the
poor
woman
turn
sadly
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
brag
about
the
news
that
day
to
the
boy
at
school
;
tell
them
how
he
be
go
to
live
with
his
grandpapa
his
father
's
father
,
not
the
one
who
come
here
sometimes
;
and
that
he
would
be
very
rich
,
and
have
a
carriage
,
and
a
pony
,
and
go
to
a
much
fine
school
,
and
when
he
be
rich
he
would
buy
Leader
's
pencil
-
case
and
pay
the
tart
-
woman
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
be
the
image
of
his
father
,
as
his
fond
mother
think
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
no
heart
,
on
account
of
our
dear
Amelia
's
sake
,
to
go
through
the
story
of
George
's
last
day
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
day
come
,
the
carriage
drive
up
,
the
little
humble
packet
contain
token
of
love
and
remembrance
be
ready
and
dispose
in
the
hall
long
since
 
George
be
in
his
new
suit
,
for
which
the
tailor
have
come
previously
to
measure
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
spring
up
with
the
sun
and
put
on
the
new
clothe
,
his
mother
hear
him
from
the
room
close
by
,
in
which
she
have
be
lie
,
in
speechless
grief
and
watching
.
 
<EOS>
day
before
she
have
be
make
preparation
for
the
end
,
purchase
little
store
for
the
boy
's
use
,
mark
his
book
and
linen
,
talk
with
him
and
prepare
him
for
the
change
 
fondly
fancy
that
he
need
preparation
.
  
<EOS>
so
that
he
have
change
,
what
care
he
?
<EOS>
He
be
long
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
by
a
thousand
eager
declaration
as
to
what
he
would
do
,
when
he
go
to
live
with
his
grandfather
,
he
have
show
the
poor
widow
how
little
the
idea
of
parting
have
cast
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
come
and
see
his
mamma
often
on
the
pony
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
come
and
fetch
her
in
the
carriage
;
they
would
drive
in
the
park
,
and
she
should
have
everything
she
want
.
<EOS>
"
the
poor
mother
be
fain
to
content
herself
with
these
selfish
demonstration
of
attachment
,
and
try
to
convince
herself
how
sincerely
her
son
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
love
her
.
<EOS>
all
child
be
so
:
a
little
anxious
for
novelty
,
and
 
no
,
not
selfish
,
but
self
-
will
.
<EOS>
Her
child
must
have
his
enjoyment
and
ambition
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
She
herself
,
by
her
own
selfishness
and
imprudent
love
for
him
have
deny
him
his
just
right
and
pleasure
hitherto
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
few
thing
more
affecting
than
that
timorous
debasement
and
self
-
humiliation
of
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
how
she
own
that
it
be
she
and
not
the
man
who
be
guilty
;
how
she
take
all
the
fault
on
her
side
;
how
she
court
in
a
manner
punishment
for
the
wrong
which
she
have
not
commit
and
persist
in
shield
the
real
culprit
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
those
who
injure
woman
who
get
the
most
kindness
from
them
 
they
be
bear
timid
and
tyrant
and
maltreat
those
who
be
humblest
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
so
poor
Amelia
have
be
get
ready
in
silent
misery
for
her
son
's
departure
,
and
have
pass
many
and
many
a
long
solitary
hour
in
make
preparation
for
the
end
.
<EOS>
George
stand
by
his
mother
,
watch
her
arrangement
without
the
least
concern
.
 
<EOS>
tear
have
fall
into
his
box
;
passage
have
be
score
in
his
favourite
book
;
old
toy
,
relic
,
treasure
have
be
hoard
away
for
him
,
and
pack
with
strange
neatness
and
care
 
and
of
all
these
thing
the
boy
take
no
note
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
go
away
smile
as
the
mother
break
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
by
heaven
it
be
pitiful
,
the
bootless
love
of
woman
for
child
in
Vanity
Fair
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
be
past
,
and
the
great
event
of
Amelia
's
life
be
consummate
.
 
<EOS>
no
angel
have
intervene
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
be
sacrifice
and
offer
up
to
fate
,
and
the
widow
be
quite
alone
.
  
<EOS>
the
boy
come
to
see
her
often
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
He
ride
on
a
pony
with
a
coachman
behind
him
,
to
the
delight
of
his
old
grandfather
,
Sedley
,
who
walk
proudly
down
the
lane
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
She
see
him
,
but
he
be
not
her
boy
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
he
ride
to
see
the
boy
at
the
little
school
,
too
,
and
to
show
off
before
them
his
new
wealth
and
splendour
.
 
<EOS>
in
two
day
he
have
adopt
a
slightly
imperious
air
and
patronizing
manner
.
<EOS>
He
be
bear
to
command
,
his
mother
think
,
as
his
father
be
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
fine
weather
now
.
 
<EOS>
of
evening
on
the
day
when
he
do
not
come
,
she
take
a
long
walk
into
London
 
<EOS>
yes
,
as
far
as
Russell
Square
,
and
rest
on
the
stone
by
the
railing
of
the
garden
opposite
Mr.
Osborne
's
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
pleasant
and
cool
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
look
up
and
see
the
drawing
-
room
window
illuminate
,
and
,
at
about
nine
o'clock
,
the
chamber
in
the
upper
story
where
Georgy
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
 
he
have
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
pray
there
as
the
light
go
out
,
pray
with
an
humble
heart
,
and
walk
home
shrinking
and
silent
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
tired
when
she
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
she
will
sleep
the
well
for
that
long
weary
walk
,
and
she
may
dream
about
Georgy
.
  
<EOS>
one
Sunday
she
happen
to
be
walk
in
Russell
Square
,
at
some
distance
from
Mr.
Osborne
's
house
<EOS>
(
she
could
see
it
from
a
distance
though
)
when
all
the
bell
of
Sabbath
be
ring
,
and
George
and
his
aunt
come
out
to
go
to
church
;
a
little
sweep
ask
for
charity
,
and
the
footman
,
who
carry
the
book
,
try
to
drive
him
away
;
but
Georgy
stop
and
give
him
money
.
 
<EOS>
May
God
's
blessing
be
on
the
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Emmy
run
round
the
square
and
,
come
up
to
the
sweep
,
give
him
her
mite
too
.
<EOS>
all
the
bell
of
Sabbath
be
ring
,
and
she
follow
them
until
she
come
to
the
Foundling
Church
,
into
which
she
go
.
 
<EOS>
there
she
sit
in
a
place
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
she
could
see
the
head
of
the
boy
under
his
father
's
tombstone
.
<EOS>
many
hundred
fresh
child
's
voice
rise
up
there
and
sing
hymn
to
the
Father
Beneficent
,
and
little
George
's
soul
thrill
with
delight
at
the
burst
of
glorious
psalmody
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
could
not
see
him
for
awhile
,
through
the
mist
that
dim
her
eye
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
a
Charade
be
act
which
May
or
May
not
puzzle
the
reader
 
after
Becky
's
appearance
at
my
Lord
Steyne
's
private
and
select
party
,
the
claim
of
that
estimable
woman
as
regard
fashion
be
settle
,
and
some
of
the
very
great
and
tall
door
in
the
metropolis
be
speedily
open
to
her
 
door
so
great
and
tall
that
the
beloved
reader
and
writer
hereof
may
hope
in
vain
to
enter
at
them
.
<EOS>
dear
brother
,
let
us
tremble
before
those
august
portal
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
them
guard
by
groom
of
the
chamber
with
flame
silver
fork
with
which
they
prong
all
those
who
have
not
the
right
of
the
entree
.
<EOS>
They
say
the
honest
newspaper
-
fellow
who
sit
in
the
hall
and
take
down
the
name
of
the
great
one
who
be
admit
to
the
feast
die
after
a
little
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
survive
the
glare
of
fashion
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
scorch
him
up
,
as
the
presence
of
Jupiter
in
full
dress
waste
that
poor
imprudent
<EOS>
Semele
 
<EOS>
a
giddy
moth
of
a
creature
who
ruin
herself
by
venture
out
of
her
natural
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
Her
myth
ought
to
be
take
to
heart
amongst
the
Tyburnians
,
the
Belgravians
 
her
story
,
and
<EOS>
perhaps
Becky
be
too
.
<EOS>
ah
,
lady
!
 
<EOS>
ask
the
Reverend
Mr.
Thurifer
if
Belgravia
be
not
a
sound
brass
and
Tyburnia
a
tinkle
cymbal
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
vanity
.
<EOS>
even
these
will
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
and
some
day
or
other
(
but
it
will
be
after
our
time
,
thank
goodness
)
<EOS>
Hyde
Park
Gardens
will
be
no
better
know
than
the
celebrated
horticultural
outskirt
of
Babylon
,
and
Belgrave
Square
will
be
as
desolate
as
Baker
Street
,
or
Tadmor
in
the
wilderness
.
  
<EOS>
lady
,
be
you
aware
that
the
great
Pitt
live
in
Baker
Street
?
<EOS>
what
would
not
your
grandmother
have
give
to
be
ask
to
Lady
Hester
's
party
in
that
now
decay
mansion
?
<EOS>
I
have
dine
in
it
 
<EOS>
moi
qui
vous
parle
<EOS>
,
I
people
the
chamber
with
ghost
of
the
mighty
dead
.
<EOS>
as
we
sit
soberly
drink
claret
there
with
man
of
to

day
,
the
spirit
of
the
depart
come
in
and
take
their
place
round
the
darksome
board
.
 
<EOS>
the
pilot
who
weather
the
storm
toss
off
great
bumper
of
spiritual
port
;
the
shade
of
Dundas
do
not
leave
the
ghost
of
a
heeltap
.
<EOS>
Addington
sit
bow
and
smirk
in
a
ghastly
manner
,
and
would
not
be
behindhand
when
the
noiseless
bottle
go
round
;
Scott
,
from
under
bushy
eyebrow
,
wink
at
the
apparition
of
a
beeswing
;
Wilberforce
's
eye
go
up
to
the
ceiling
,
so
that
he
do
not
seem
to
know
how
his
glass
go
up
full
to
his
mouth
and
come
down
empty
;
up
to
the
ceiling
which
be
above
us
only
yesterday
,
and
which
the
great
of
the
past
day
have
all
look
at
.
<EOS>
They
let
the
house
as
a
furnished
lodging
now
.
<EOS>
yes
,
Lady
Hester
once
live
in
Baker
Street
,
and
lie
asleep
in
the
wilderness
.
<EOS>
Eothen
see
her
there
 
not
in
Baker
Street
,
but
in
the
other
solitude
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
all
vanity
to
be
sure
,
but
who
will
not
own
to
like
a
little
of
it
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
what
well
-
constitute
mind
,
merely
because
it
be
transitory
,
dislike
roast
beef
?
<EOS>
that
be
a
vanity
,
but
may
every
man
who
read
this
have
a
wholesome
portion
of
it
through
life
,
I
beg
:
<EOS>
aye
,
though
my

be
five
hundred
thousand
.
<EOS>
sit
down
,
gentleman
,
and
fall
to
,
with
a
good
hearty
appetite
;
the
fat
,
the
lean
,
the
gravy
,
the
horse
-
radish
as
you
like
it
 
do
not
spare
it
.
 
<EOS>
another
glass
of
wine
,
Jones
,
my
boy
 
a
little
bit
of
the
Sunday
side
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
let
us
eat
our
fill
of
the
vain
thing
and
be
thankful
therefor
.
<EOS>
and
let
us
make
the
good
of
Becky
's
aristocratic
pleasure
likewise
 
for
these
too
,
like
all
other
mortal
delight
,
be
but
transitory
.
  
<EOS>
the
upshot
of
her
visit
to
Lord
Steyne
be
that
His
Highness
the
Prince
of
Peterwaradin
take
occasion
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
Colonel
Crawley
,
when
they
meet
on
the
next
day
at
the
Club
,
and
to
compliment
Mrs.
Crawley
in
the
ring
of
Hyde
Park
with
a
profound
salute
of
the
hat
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
be
invite
immediately
to
one
of
the
Prince
's
small
party
at
Levant
House
,
then
occupy
by
His
Highness
during
the
temporary
absence
from
England
of
its
noble
proprietor
.
 
<EOS>
She
sing
after
dinner
to
a
very
little
comite
.
<EOS>
the
Marquis
of
Steyne
be
present
,
paternally
superintend
the
progress
of
his
pupil
.
  
<EOS>
at
Levant
House
Becky
meet
one
of
the
fine
gentleman
and
great
minister
that
Europe
have
produce
 
the
Duc
de
la
Jabotiere
,
then
Ambassador
from
the
most
christian
King
,
and
subsequently
Minister
to
that
monarch
.
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
swell
with
pride
as
these
august
name
be
transcribe
by
my
pen
,
and
I
think
in
what
brilliant
company
my
dear
Becky
be
move
.
 
<EOS>
She
become
a
constant
guest
at
the
French
Embassy
,
where
no
party
be
consider
to
be
complete
without
the
presence
of
the
charming
Madame
Ravdonn
Cravley
.
 
<EOS>
Messieurs
de
Truffigny
(
of
the
Perigord
family
)
and
Champignac
,
both
attache
of
the
Embassy
,
be
straightway
smitten
by
the
charm
of
the
fair
Colonel
's
wife
,
and
both
declare
,
accord
to
the
will
not
of
their
nation
(
for
who
ever
yet
meet
a
Frenchman
,
come
out
of
England
,
that
have
not
leave
half
a
dozen
family
miserable
,
and
bring
away
as
many
heart
in
his
pocket
-
book
?
)
,
<EOS>
both
,
I
say
,
declare
that
they
be
au
mieux
with
the
charming
Madame
Ravdonn
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
the
correctness
of
the
assertion
.
 
<EOS>
Champignac
be
very
fond
of
ecarte
,
and
make
many
party
with
the
Colonel
of
evening
,
while
Becky
be
singe
to
Lord
Steyne
in
the
other
room
;
and
as
for
Truffigny
,
it
be
a
well
-
know
fact
that
he
dare
not
go
to
the
Travellers
'
,
where
he
owe
money
to
the
waiter
,
and
if
he
have
not
have
the
Embassy
as
a
dining
-
place
,
the
worthy
young
gentleman
must
have
starve
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
I
say
,
that
Becky
would
have
select
either
of
these
young

they

English
with
adorable
simplicity

and
to
the
constant
amusement
of
Becky

my
Lord

she
would
mimic
one

his

,
and
compliment
him
on

with
a

those

probably
to
Lady

<EOS>
It
be
currently
report
that
even
in

they
be
no
happy
than
the
poor
wanderer
outside

George

Vanity

<EOS>
We
must
be
brief
in
descant
upon
this
part
of
her
career
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
can
not
describe
the
mystery
of
freemasonry
,
although
I
have
a
shrewd
idea
that
it
be
a
humbug
,
so
an
uninitiated
man
can
not
take
upon
himself
to
portray
the
great
world
accurately
,
and
have
best
keep
his
opinion
to
himself
,
whatever
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
Becky
have
often
speak
in
subsequent
year
of
this
season
of
her

London

and
then

<EOS>
at
first
no

more
pleasant

to
invent

procure
(
the
latter

work

no
small
trouble
and
ingenuity
,
by
the
way
,
in
a
person
of
Mrs.
Rawdon
Crawley
's
very
narrow
mean
)
 
to
procure
,
we
say
,
the
pretty
new
dress
and
ornament
;
to
drive
to
fine
dinner
party
,
where
she
be
welcome
by
great
people
;
and
from
the
fine
dinner
party
to
fine

,
whither
the

people
come
with
whom
she
have
be

she
have
meet
the
night
before

would
see
on

They

<EOS>
They
talk
about

I

She

artless

they
amuse
him

Rawdon

He

I

I

<EOS>
"
how
Lady

Becky
always
make
a

conspicuously
polite
to
the
professional

who
attend
at
these
aristocratic

them
into
the
corner
where
they
sit
in
silence

and
shake
hand
with

and
smile
in
the
view
of
all
person

<EOS>
She
be
an
artist
herself
,
as
she
say
very
truly
;
there
be
a
frankness
and
humility
in
the
manner
in
which
she
acknowledge
her
origin

which
provoke
,
or
disarm
,
or
amuse

<EOS>
"
how
cool
that

what

where
she
ought

what
an

"
what

artful

<EOS>
They
be
all
right
very
likely
,
but
Becky
go
her
own
way
,
and
so
fascinated
the
professional
personage
that
they
would
leave
off

say
a
rude
thing
to
Mrs.
Crawley
again

make
her
the
butt

His

chief
confidential
servant
(
with
a

in
parliament

at
the
dinner
table

,
Mr.
Wenham

be
much
more
prudent
in
his
behaviour
and
opinion
than
Mr.
Wagg
.
 
<EOS>
however
much
he
may
be
dispose
to
hate
all
parvenus
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Wenham

staunch
old
True
Blue
Tory

this

of

never
show
any
sort
of
hostility
to
the
new
favourite

but
pursue
her
with
stealthy
kindness

a
sly
and
deferential
politeness
which
somehow
make
Becky
more
uneasy
than
other
people
's
overt
hostility
.
  
<EOS>
how
the
Crawleys
get
the
money
which
be
spend
upon
the
entertainment
with
which
they
treat
the
polite
world
be
a
mystery
which
give
rise
to
some
conversation
at
the
time

and
probably
add
zest
to
these
little
festivity
.
 
<EOS>
some
person
aver
that
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
give
his
brother
a
handsome
allowance
;
if
he
do
,
Becky
's
power
over
the
Baronet
must
have
be
extraordinary
indeed
,
and
his
character
greatly
change
in
his
advanced
age
.
 
<EOS>
other
party
hint
that
it
be
Becky
's
habit
to
levy
contribution
on
all
her
husband
's
friend
:
go
to
this
one
in
tear
with
an
account
that
there
be
an
execution
in
the
house
;
fall
on
her
knee
to
that
one
and
declare
that
the
whole
family
must
go
to
gaol
or
commit
suicide
unless
such
and
such
a
bill
could
be
pay
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Southdown
,
it
be

have
be
induce

many
hundred

pathetic
representation

,
and
whom
the
Crawleys
introduce

,
be
also
cite
as
one
of
Becky
's
victim
in
the
pecuniary
way

<EOS>
People
declare
that
she
get
money
from

simply
disposed
person

under

confidential
appointment
under

.
<EOS>
who
know
what
story
be
or
be
not
tell
of
our
dear
and
innocent
friend

<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
if
she
have
have
all
the
money
which
she
be
say
to
have
beg
or
borrow
or
steal
,
she
may
have
capitalize
and
be
honest
for
life
,
whereas
,
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
advance
matter
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
by
economy
and
good
management
 
by
a
spare
use
of
ready
money
and
by
pay
scarcely
anybody
 
people
can
manage
,
for
a
time
at
least
,
to
make
a
great
show
with
very
little
mean
:
and
it
be
our
belief
that
Becky
's
much
-
talk
-
of
party
,
which
be
not
,
after
all
be
say
,
very
numerous
,
cost
this

very
little
more

the
wax
candle
which
light

<EOS>
Stillbrook

Queen

her

<EOS>
Lord
Steyne
's
cellar
be
at
her
disposal
,
and
that
excellent
nobleman

cook
preside
over
her
little
kitchen
,
or
send
by
my
lord
's
order
the
rare
delicacy
from
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
protest
it
be
quite
shameful
in
the
world
to
abuse
a
simple
creature
,
as
people
of
her
time
abuse
Becky
,
and
I
warn
the
public
against
believe
one
-
tenth
of
the
story
against
her
.
<EOS>
if
every
person
be
to
be
banish
from
society
who
run
into
debt
and
can
not
pay
 
if
we
be
to
be
peer
into
everybody
's
private
life
,
speculate
upon
their
income
,
and
cut
them
if
we
do
not
approve
of
their
expenditure
 
<EOS>
why
,
what
a
howl
wilderness
and
intolerable
dwelling
Vanity
Fair
would
be

<EOS>
every
man
's
hand
would
be
against
his
neighbour
in
this
case
,
my
dear
sir

and
the
benefit
of
civilization
would
be
do
away
with
.
<EOS>
We
should
be
quarrel
,
abuse
,
avoid
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Our
house
would
become
cavern
,
and
we
should
go
in
rag
because
we
care

nobody

<EOS>
rent
would
go
down

<EOS>
party

all
the

I

would
go
to
the
deuce
,
if
people
do
but
act
upon
their
silly
principle
and
avoid
those
whom
they
dislike
and
abuse
.
 
<EOS>
whereas
,
by
a
little
charity
and
mutual
forbearance
,
thing
be
make
to
go
on
pleasantly
enough
:
 
we
may
abuse
a
man
as
much
as
we
like
,
and
call
him
the
great
rascal
unhanged
 
but
do
we
wish
to
hang
him
therefore
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
We
shake
hand
when
we
meet
.
 
<EOS>
if
his
cook
be
good
we
forgive
him
and
go
and
dine
with
him
,
and
we
expect
he
will
do
the
same
by
us
.
 
<EOS>
thus
trade
flourish
 
<EOS>
civilization
advance

peace

new

it

essentially
different

It

at

home
on
Saturdays
to
his
father

who
always
make
a
jubilee
of
that
day

<EOS>
when
free
,
Rawdon
would
take
him
to
the
play
,
or
send
him
thither
with
the
footman
;
and
on
Sundays
he
go
to
church
with
Briggs
and
Lady
Jane
and
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
Rawdon
marvel
over
his
story
about
school

and
fight
,
and
fagging
.
 
<EOS>
before
long
,
he
know
the
name
of
all

and
the
principal
boy
as
well
as
little

<EOS>
He
invite
little
Rawdon

crony
from
school

and
make
both
the
child
sick
with
pastry

and
oyster
,
and
porter
after
the
play

<EOS>
He
try

"
Stick

<EOS>
Becky

contempt

grow
great
every

"

I
have
your

as
you
can
not
attend
to

<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
where
you
would
have
be
now
,
and
in
what
sort
of
a
position
in
society
,
if
I

after
you

"
<EOS>
indeed
,
nobody
want
poor
old
Rawdon
at
the
party
whither
Becky
use
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
often
ask
without
him
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
talk
about
great
people
as
if
she
have
the
fee
-
simple
of
May
Fair
,
and
when
the
Court
go
into
mourning
,
she
always
wear
black
.
  
<EOS>
little
Rawdon
be
dispose
of
,
Lord
Steyne
,
who
take
such
a
parental
interest
in
the
affair
of
this
amiable
poor
family
,
think
that
their
expense
may
be
very
advantageously
curtail
by
the
departure
of
Miss
Briggs
,
and
that
Becky
be
quite
clever
enough
to
take
the
management
of
her
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
narrate
in
a
former
chapter
how
the
benevolent
nobleman
have
give
his
protegee
money
to
pay
off
her
little
debt
to
Miss
Briggs
,
who
however
still
remain
behind
with
her
friend
;
whence
my
lord
come
to
the
painful
conclusion
that
Mrs.
Crawley
have
make
some
other
use
of
the
money
confide
to
her
than
that
for
which
her
generous
patron
have
give
the
loan
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
Lord
Steyne
be
not
so
rude
as
to
impart
his
suspicion
upon
this
head
to
Mrs.
Becky
,
whose
feeling
may
be
hurt
by
any
controversy
on
the
money
-
question
,
and
who
may
have
a
thousand
painful
reason
for
dispose
otherwise
of
his
lordship
's
generous
loan
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
determine
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
real
state
of
the
case
,
and
institute
the
necessary
inquiry
in
a
most
cautious
and
delicate
manner
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
he
take
an
early
opportunity
of
pump
Miss
Briggs
.
<EOS>
that
be
not
a
difficult
operation
.
<EOS>
a
very
little
encouragement
would
set
that
worthy
woman
to
talk
volubly
and
pour
out
all
within
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
one
day
when
Mrs.
Rawdon
have
go
out
to
drive
(
as
Mr.
Fiche
,
his
lordship
's
confidential
servant
,
easily
learn
at
the
livery
stable
where
the
Crawleys
keep
their
carriage
and
horse
,
or
rather
,
where
the
livery
-
man
keep
a
carriage
and
horse
for
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Crawley
)
 
my
lord
drop
in
upon
the
Curzon
Street
house
 
<EOS>
ask
Briggs
for
a
cup
of
coffee
 
<EOS>
tell
her
that
he
have
good
account
of
the
little
boy
at
school
 
and
in
five
minute
find
out
from
her
that
Mrs.
Rawdon
have
give
her
nothing
except
a
black
silk
gown
,
for
which
Miss
Briggs
be
immensely
grateful
.
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
within
himself
at
this
artless
story
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
truth
be
,
our
dear
friend
Rebecca
have
give
him
a
most
circumstantial
narration
of
Briggs
's
delight
at
receive
her
money
 
eleven
hundred
and
twenty
-
five
pound
 
and
in
what
security
she
have
invest
it
;
and
what
a
pang
Becky
herself
feel
in
be
oblige
to
pay
away
such
a
delightful
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
know
,
"
the
dear
woman
may
have
think
within
herself
,
"
perhaps
he
may
give
me
a
little
more
?
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
however
,
make
no
such
proposal
to
the
little
schemer
 
very
likely
thinking
that
he
have
be
sufficiently
generous
already
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
the
curiosity
,
then
,
to
ask
Miss
Briggs
about
the
state
of
her
private
affair
 
<EOS>
and
she
tell
his
lordship
candidly
what
her
position
be
 
how
Miss
Crawley
have
leave
her
a
legacy
 
<EOS>
how
her
relative
have
have
part
of
it
 
<EOS>
how
Colonel
Crawley
have
put
out
another
portion
,
for
which
she
have
the
good
security
and
interest
 
and
how
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rawdon
have
kindly
busy
themselves
with
Sir
Pitt
,
who
be
to
dispose
of
the
remainder
most
advantageously
for
her
,
when
he
have
time
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
ask
how
much
the
Colonel
have
already
invest
for
her
,
and
Miss
Briggs
at
once
and
truly
tell
him
that
the
sum
be
six
hundred
and
odd
pound
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
she
have
tell
her
story
,
the
voluble
Briggs
repent
of
her
frankness
and
besought
my
lord
not
to
tell
Mr.
Crawley
of
the
confession
which
she
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
Colonel
be
<EOS>
so
kind
 
Mr.
Crawley
may
be
offend
and
pay
back
the
money
,
for
which
she
could
get
no
such
good
interest
anywhere
else
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Steyne
,
laughing
,
promise
he
never
would
divulge
their
conversation
,
and
when
he
and
Miss
Briggs
part
he
laugh
still
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
an
accomplished
little
devil
it
be
!
"
<EOS>
think
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
splendid
actress
and
manager
!
 
<EOS>
She
have
almost
get
a
second
supply
out
of
me
the
other
day
;
with
her
coax
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
beat
all
the
woman
I
have
ever
see
in
the
course
of
all
my
well
-
spend
life
.
<EOS>
They
be
baby
compare
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
greenhorn
myself
,
and
a
fool
in
her
hand
 
an
old
fool
.
<EOS>
She
be
unsurpassable
in
lie
.
"
<EOS>
His
lordship
's
admiration
for
Becky
rise
immeasurably
at
this
proof
of
her
cleverness
.
 
<EOS>
get
the
money
be
nothing
 
but
get
double
the
sum
she
want
,
and
pay
nobody
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
magnificent
stroke
.
<EOS>
and
Crawley
,
my
lord
think
 
Crawley
be
not
such
a
fool
as
he
look
and
seem
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
manage
the
matter
cleverly
enough
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
nobody
would
ever
have
suppose
from
his
face
and
demeanour
that
he
know
anything
about
this
money
business
;
and
yet
he
put
her
up
to
it
,
and
have
spend
the
money
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
opinion
my
lord
,
we
know
,
be
mistaken
,
but
it
influence
a
good
deal
his
behaviour
towards
Colonel
Crawley
,
whom
he
begin
to
treat
with
even
less
than
that
semblance
of
respect
which
he
have
formerly
show
towards
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
enter
into
the
head
of
Mrs.
Crawley
's
patron
that
the
little
lady
may
be
make
a
purse
for
herself
;
and
,
perhaps
,
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
he
judge
of
Colonel
Crawley
by
his
experience
of
other
husband
,
whom
he
have
know
in
the
course
of
the
long
and
well
-
spend
life
which
have
make
him
acquaint
with
a
great
deal
of
the
weakness
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
have
buy
so
many
man
during
his
life
that
he
be
surely
to
be
pardon
for
supposing
that
he
have
find
the
price
of
this
one
.
  
<EOS>
He
tax
Becky
upon
the
point
on
the
very
first
occasion
when
he
meet
her
alone
,
and
he
compliment
her
,
good
-
humouredly
,
on
her
cleverness
in
get
more
than
the
money
which
she
require
.
 
<EOS>
Becky
be
only
a
little
take
aback
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
habit
of
this
dear
creature
to
tell
falsehood
,
except
when
necessity
compel
,
but
in
these
great
emergency
it
be
her
practice
to
lie
very
freely
;
and
in
an
instant
she
be
ready
with
another
neat
plausible
circumstantial
story
which
she
administer
to
her
patron
.
 
<EOS>
the
previous
statement
which
she
have
make
to
him
be
a
falsehood
 
<EOS>
a
wicked
falsehood
 
<EOS>
she
own
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
who
have
make
her
tell
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
my
Lord
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
do
not
know
all
I
have
to
suffer
and
bear
in
silence

you

me
gay
and
happy
before
you
 
<EOS>
you
little
know
what
I
have
to
endure
when
there
be
no
protector
near
me

<EOS>
It
be
my
husband
,
by
threat
and
the
most
savage
treatment
,
force
me
to
ask
for
that
sum
about
which
I
deceive
you

It
be
he
who

foresee
that
question
may
be
ask
regard
the
disposal
of
the
money

force
me
to
account
for
it

I
do

He

the
money
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
have
pay
Miss
Briggs
;
I
do
not
want
,
I
do
not
dare
to
doubt
him
.
<EOS>
pardon
the
wrong
which
a
desperate
man
be
force
to
commit
,
and
pity
a
miserable
,
miserable
woman

<EOS>
She
burst
into
tear
as
she
speak
.
 
<EOS>
persecute
virtue
never
look
more
bewitchingly
wretched
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
a
long
conversation
,
drive
round
and
round
the
Regent
's
Park
in
Mrs.
Crawley
's
carriage
together
,
a
conversation
of
which
it
be
not
necessary
to
repeat
the
detail
,
but
the
upshot
of
it
be
that
,
when
Becky
come
home
,
she
fly
to
her
dear
Briggs
with
a
smile
face
and
announce
that
she
have
some
very
good
news
for
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Steyne
have
act
in
the
noble
and
most
generous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
think
how
and
when
he
could
do
good
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
little
Rawdon
be
go
to
school
,
a
dear
companion
and
friend
be
no
longer
necessary
to
her

<EOS>
She
be
grieve
beyond
measure
to
part
with
Briggs
,
but
her
mean
require
that
she
should
practise
every
retrenchment
,
and
her
sorrow
be
mitigate
by
the
idea
that
her
dear
Briggs
would
be
far
better
provide
for
by
her
generous
patron
than
in
her
humble
home
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pilkington
,
the
housekeeper
at
Gauntly
Hall
,
be
grow
exceedingly
old
,
feeble
,
and
rheumatic
:
she
be
not
equal
to
the
work
of
superintend
that
vast
mansion
,
and
must
be
on
the
look
out
for
a
successor
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
splendid
position
.
<EOS>
the
family
do
not
go
to
gauntly
once
in
two
year

<EOS>
at
other
time
the

Mrs.

Rector

the
place
be
not

be
hers
yet

but
she
may
go
down
on
a
visit
to
Mrs.
Pilkington
and
see
whether
she
would
like
to
succeed
her
.
  
<EOS>
what
word
can
paint
the
ecstatic
gratitude
of
Briggs
!
<EOS>
all
she
stipulate
for
be
that
little
Rawdon
should
be
allow
to
come
down
and
see
her
at
the
Hall

<EOS>
Becky
promise
this
 
anything
.
 
<EOS>
She
run
up
to
her
husband
when
he
come
home
and
tell
him
the
joyful
news
.
<EOS>
Rawdon
be
glad
,
deuced
glad
;
the
weight
be
off
his
conscience
about
poor
Briggs
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
provide
for
,
at
any
rate
,
but
 
but
his
mind
be
disquiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
seem
to
be
all
right
,
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
little
Southdown
what
Lord
Steyne
have
do
,
and
the
young
man
eye
Crawley
with
an
air
which
surprise
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
Lady
Jane
of
this
second
proof
of
Steyne
's
bounty
,
and
she
,
too
,
look
odd
and
alarm
;
so
do
Sir
Pitt
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
too
clever
and
 
and
gay
to
be
allow
to
go
from
party
to
party
without
a
companion
,
"
both
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
with
her
,
Rawdon
,
wherever
she
go
,
and
you
must
have
somebody
with
her
 
one
of
the
girl
from
Queen
's
Crawley
,
perhaps
,
though
they
be
rather
giddy
guardian
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
somebody
Becky
should
have
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
meantime
it
be
clear
that
honest
Briggs
must
not
lose
her
chance
of
settlement
for
life
,
and
so
she
and
her
bag
be
pack
,
and
she
set
off
on
her
journey
.
<EOS>
and
so
two
of
Rawdon
's
out

sentinel
be
in
the
hand
of
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Pitt
go
and
expostulate
with
his
sister
-
in

law
upon
the
subject
of
the
dismissal
of
Briggs
and
other
matter
of
delicate
family
interest

<EOS>
in
vain
she
point
out
to
him
how
necessary
be
the
protection
of
Lord
Steyne
for
her
poor
husband
;
how
cruel
it
would
be
on
their
part
to
deprive
Briggs
of
the
position
offer
to
her
.
<EOS>
cajolement
,
coaxing
,
smile
,
tear
could
not
satisfy
Sir
Pitt
,
and
he
have
something
very
like
a
quarrel
with
his
once
admire
Becky
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
of
the
honour
of
the

be
a
man
whose
attention
would
compromise
any

he
beseech
,
he
implore
,
he
command
his
sister
-
in

law
to
be
watchful
in
her
intercourse
with
that

<EOS>
Becky
promise
anything
and
everything
Pitt
want
;
but
Lord
Steyne
come
to
her
house
as
often
as
ever
,
and
Sir
Pitt
's
anger
increase
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
be
Lady
Jane
angry
or
please
that
her
husband
at
last
find
fault
with
his
favourite
Rebecca
?
<EOS>
Lord
Steyne
's
visit
continue
,
his

ceased
,
and
his
wife
be
for
refuse
all
further
intercourse
with
that
nobleman
and
decline
the
invitation
to
the
charade
-
night
which
the
marchioness
send
to
her
;
but
Sir
Pitt
think
it
be
necessary
to
accept
it
,
as
his
Royal
Highness
would
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
although
he
go
to
the
party
in
question
,
Sir
Pitt
quit
it
very
early
,
and
his
wife
,
too
,
be
very
glad
to
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
Becky
hardly
so
much
as
speak
to
him
or
notice
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
Pitt
Crawley
declare
her
behaviour
be
monstrously
indecorous
,
reprobate
in
strong
term
the
habit
of
play
-
acting
and
fancy
dressing
as
highly
unbecoming
a
british
female
,
and
after
the
charade
be
over
,
take
his
brother
Rawdon
severely
to
task
for
appear
himself
and
allow
his
wife
to
join
in
such
improper
exhibition
.
  
<EOS>
Rawdon
say
she
should
not
join
in
any
more
such
amusement
 
but
indeed
,
and
perhaps
from
hint
from
his
eld
brother
and
sister
,
he
have
already
become
a
very
watchful
and
exemplary
domestic
character
.
<EOS>
He
leave
off
his
club
and
billiard
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
leave
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
Becky
out
to
drive
;
he
go
laboriously
with
her
to
all
her
party
.
<EOS>
whenever
my
Lord
Steyne
call
,
he
be
sure
to
find
the
Colonel
.
<EOS>
and
when
Becky
propose
to
go
out
without
her
husband
,
or
receive
invitation
for
herself
,
he
peremptorily
order
her
to
refuse
them
:
and
there
be
that
in
the
gentleman
's
manner
which
enforce
obedience
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Becky
,
to
do
her
justice
,
be
charm
with
Rawdon
's
gallantry
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
surly
,
she
never
be
.
<EOS>
whether
friend
be
present
or
absent
,
she
have
always
a
kind
smile
for
him
and
be
attentive
to
his
pleasure
and
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
early
day
of
their
marriage
over
again
:
 
the
same
good
humour
,
prevenance
,
merriment
,
and
artless
confidence
and
regard
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
much
pleasanter
it
be

"
she
would
say
,
"
to
have
you
by
my

in
the
carriage
than
that
foolish
old

He

She

She

<EOS>
sometimes

and
go

,
listen
all
the
while
for

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
It

"
<EOS>
Rawdon

<EOS>
He

her
in
his
arm
 
gasp
out
some
inarticulate
word
of
thank
and
fairly
sob
on
her
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not

the
cause
of
his
emotion

<EOS>
the

perhaps
to
the
disappointment
of
that

,
who
have

happiness
in

;
and
she
put
her
kind
hand
in
his

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
well
for
Rawdon
Crawley
that
Pitt
be
away
at
that
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Rawdon
thank

sister

<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
Sir

instantly
guess
the
truth

surmise
that
Lord

Rawdon

the

tell
his

off

another

and
when
I
get
home
I
find
her
in
diamond
and
sit
with
that
villain
alone

"
<EOS>
He
then
go
on
to
describe
hurriedly
the
personal
conflict
with
Lord
Steyne
.
 
<EOS>
to
an
affair
of
that
nature
,
of
course
,
he
say
,
there
be

one
issue
,

after
his
conference
with
his

he
be
go
away
to
make
the
necessary
arrangement
for
the
meeting
which
must
ensue

<EOS>
"
and
as
it
may
end
fatally
with
me
,
"
Rawdon
say
with
a
break
voice
,
"
and
as
the
boy
have
no
mother
,
I
must
leave
him
to
you
and
Jane
,
Pitt
 
only
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
if
you
will
promise
me
to
be
his
friend

"
  
<EOS>
the
eld
brother
be
much
affect
,
and
shake
Rawdon
's
hand
with
a
cordiality
seldom
exhibit
by
him

<EOS>
Rawdon
pass
his
hand
over
his
shaggy
eyebrow
.
"
<EOS>
thank
you

brother

"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
can
trust
your

<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
,
upon
my
honour

the
Baronet
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
,
and
almost
mutely
,
this
bargain
be
strike
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
then
Rawdon
take
out
of
his
pocket
the
little
pocket
-
book
which
he
have
discover
in
Becky
's
desk
,
and
from
which
he
draw
a
bundle
of
the
note
which
it
contain
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
six
hundred
,
"
he
say
 
"
you
do
not
know
I
be
so
rich

<EOS>
I
want
you
to
give
the
money
to
Briggs
,
who
lend
it
to
us
 
and
who
be
kind
to
the
boy
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
always
feel
ashamed
of
have
take
the
poor
old
woman
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
be
some
more
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
keep
back
a
few
pound
 
which
Becky
may
as
well
have
,
to
get
on
with
.
<EOS>
"
as
he
speak
he
take
hold
of
the
other
note
to
give
to
his
brother
,
but
his
hand
shake
,
and
he
be
so
agitated
that
the
pocket
-
book
fall
from
him
,
and
out
of
it
the
thousand

pound
note
which
have
be
the
last
of
the
unlucky
Becky
's
winning

<EOS>
Pitt
stoop
and
pick
them
up
,
amazed
at
so
much
wealth

<EOS>
"
not
that

Rawdon
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
to
put
a
bullet
into
the
man
whom
that
belong
to

"
<EOS>
He
have
think
to
himself
,
it
would
be
a
fine
revenge
to
wrap
a
ball
in
the
note
and
kill
Steyne
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
colloquy
the
brother
once
more
shook
hand
and
part
.
<EOS>
Lady

have
hear
of
the
Colonel

and
the

She

<EOS>
I
have
receive
Lord

It

Mr.
Macmurdo
look
at

principal
with
the
air

Rawdon
feel
with
a
kind
of
rage

his
prey

He
do
not

how
discredit

it

<EOS>
Mr.

continue
with

fluent
oratory

in

Parliament
he
have
so
often
practise

I
sit
for
an
hour

I
acknowledge

in
 
<EOS>
I
say
that
a
man
furious
with
jealousy
be
to
all
intent

purpose
a
madman

should
be
as
such
regard
 
that
a
duel
between
you
must
lead
to
the
disgrace
of
all
party
concern
 
that
a
man

exalt
station
have
no

most
atrocious
revolutionary
principle

the
most
dangerous

doctrine
be
preach
among

innocent

not

his

deadly
pale

this
savage
interruption

he
find
a
champion
in
Captain

rise
up

rebuke
Rawdon

you
deserve

as
for

you

him

for
the
affair

with

my

there
be
nothing
prove
at
all

that
your
wife

innocent

as
innocent

be

at

fool

hold
your
tongue

this

bury
in
the
most
profound
oblivion

remark

duelling

the
unsatisfactory
nature

he
try

Mr.

<EOS>
His

<EOS>
He
have
be
glad
enough
in

to
put
the
eld
George
to
a
good
private
school
;
and
a
commission
in
the
army
for
his

have
be
a
source
of
no

pride
to
him
;
for
little
George
and
his

prospect
the

look
much
high

<EOS>
He
would
make
a

of
the

,
be
Mr.
Osborne
's
constant
saying
regard
little
Georgy
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
him
in
his
mind
's
eye
,
a
collegian
,
a
Parliament
man
,
a
Baronet
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
think
he
would
die
contented
if
he
could
see
his
grandson
in
a
fair
way
to
such
honour
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
none
but
a
tip
-
top
college
man
to
educate
him
 
none
of
your
quack
and
pretender
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
year
before
,
he
use
to
be
savage
,
and
inveigh
against
all
parson
,
scholar
,
and
the
like
declare
that
they
be
a
pack
of
humbug
,
and
quack
that
be
not
fit
to
get
their
living
but
by
grind
latin
and
Greek
,
and
a
set
of
supercilious
dog
that
pretend
to
look
down
upon
british
merchant
and
gentleman
,
who
could
buy
up
half
a
hundred
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
mourn
now
,
in
a
very
solemn
manner
,
that
his
own
education
have
be
neglect
,
and
repeatedly
point
out
,
in
pompous
oration
to
Georgy
,
the
necessity
and
excellence
of
classical
acquirement
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
meet
at
dinner
the
grandsire
use
to
ask
the
lad
what
he
have
be
read
during
the
day
,
and
be
greatly
interested
at
the
report
the

give
of
his

,
pretend
to
understand
little
George
when
he
speak
regard
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
hundred
blunder
and
show
his
ignorance
many
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
increase
the
respect
which
the
child
have
for
his
senior
.
<EOS>
a
quick
brain
and
a
well
education
elsewhere
show
the
boy
very
soon
that
his
grandsire
be
a
dullard
,
and
he
begin
accordingly
to
command
him
and
to
look
down
upon
him
;
for
his
previous
education
,
humble
and
contract
as
it
have
be
,
have
make
a
much
well
gentleman
of
Georgy
than
any
plan
of
his
grandfather
could
make
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
bring
up
by
a
kind
,
weak
,
and
tender
woman
,
who
have
no
pride
about
anything
<EOS>
but
about
him
,
and
whose
heart
be
so
pure
and
whose
bearing
be
so
meek
and
humble
that
she
could
not
but
need
be
a
true
lady
.
 
<EOS>
She
busy
herself
in
gentle
office
and
quiet
duty
;
if
she
never
say
brilliant
thing
,
she
never
speak
or
think
unkind
one
;
guileless
and
artless

loving
and
pure
,
indeed
how
could
our
poor

other

a
real
gentlewoman

<EOS>
Young
Georgy
lord
over
this
soft
and
yielding
nature

and
the
contrast
of
its
simplicity
and
delicacy
with
the
coarse
pomposity
of
the
dull
old

with
whom
he
next

lord
over
the
latter

<EOS>
if
he

Prince
Royal
he
could
not

be
better
bring
up

<EOS>
whilst
his

and
I
do
believe
every
hour
of
the
day
,
and
during
most
hour
of
the
sad
lonely
night
,
think
of
him

this
young
gentleman
have
a
number
of
pleasure
and
consolation
administer
to
him

which
make
him
for
his

bear
the
separation
from
Amelia
very
easily
.
 
<EOS>
little

who
cry

It

<EOS>
when
you

that
the
eye
of
your

dry
at
the
sight
of
a
piece
of
gingerbread
,
and
that
a

cake
be
a
compensation
for
the
agony
of
part

oh

you

Old

,
who
take
matter
more
easily
in

where
he

his

would
often
ride
out
with
Miss
O.
 
in

fashionable
direction

<EOS>
as
little
Georgy
come
canter
up
with
his

down
,
his
grandfather
would
nudge
the
lad
's
aunt
and
say
,
"
look
,
Miss
O.
"
<EOS>
and
he
would
laugh
,
and
his
face
would
grow
red
with
pleasure
,
as
he
nod
out
of
the
window
to
the
boy
,
as
the
groom
salute
the

salute
Master

<EOS>
Mrs.

I

flung
glance
of
the
bitter
hatred
at
the
little
upstart
as
he
ride
by
with
his

on
his

his

on

as

<EOS>
His

have
give
him
a

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Her
humble
present

<EOS>
I
believe
Miss

have
give
them
to
the

<EOS>
Amelia
try

She

"

<EOS>
"
I

Amelia

the
case
,
and
give
a
little
cry
of
delighted
affection
,
seize
the
boy
and
embrace
him
a
hundred
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
miniature

of
himself
,
very
prettily
do
(
though
not
half
handsome
enough
,
we
may
be
sure

the

think
)
.
 
<EOS>
His

have
wish
to

bethought
him
of
ask
the

how
much
a
copy
of
the
little

would
cost

say
that
he
would
pay
for
it
out
of
his

growl
out
his
satisfaction

<EOS>
but
what

a

Mr.

what
he
call
a

library

all
the
work

the
good
author
of
ancient

modern
time
and
language

<EOS>
He
take
the

to
the
British
Museum
and
descant
upon
the
antiquity

the
specimen

so

he
take

the

give
him

rightly
judge

it

go
to
"
the
Square
,
"
as
it
be
call
,
and
assist
in
the
preparation
incident
to
a
great
dinner
,
without
even
so
much
as
thinking
of
sit
down
to
the
banquet
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
guest
fail
at
the
eleventh
hour

<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
and
Maria
come
across
in
the
evening
,
slip
in
with
a
muffled
knock
,
and
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
by
the
time
Miss
Osborne
and
the
lady
under
her
convoy
reach
that
apartment
 
and
ready
to
fire
off
duet
and
sing
until
the
gentleman
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Maria
Todd
;
poor
young
lady
!
 
<EOS>
how
she
have
to
work
and
thrum
at
these
duet
and
sonata
in
the
Street
,
before
they
appear
in
public
in
the
Square
!
  
<EOS>
thus
it
seem
to
be
decree
by
fate
that
Georgy
be
to
domineer
over
everybody
with
whom
he
come
in
contact
,
and
that
friend
,
relative
,
and
domestic
be
all
to
bow
the
knee
before
the
little
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
that
he
accommodate
himself
very
willingly
to
this
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
Most
people
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
and
Georgy
like
to
play
the
part
of
master
and
perhaps
have
a
natural
aptitude
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
Russell
Square
everybody
be
afraid
of
Mr.
Osborne
,
and
Mr.
Osborne
be
afraid
of
Georgy
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy

dash
manner
,
and
offhand
rattle
about
book
and
learning
,
his
likeness
to
his
father
(
dead
unreconciled
in
Brussels
yonder
)
awe
the
old
gentleman
and
give
the
young
boy
the
mastery
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
would
start
at
some
hereditary
feature
or
tone
unconsciously
use
by
the
little
lad
,
and
fancy
that
George
's
father
be
again
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
by
indulgence
to
the
grandson
to
make
up
for
harshness
to
the
eld
George
.
 
<EOS>
People
be
surprised
at
his
gentleness
to
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
growl
and
swear
at
Miss
Osborne
as
usual
,
and
would
smile
when
George
come
down
late
for
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Osborne

George

aunt

be
a
fade
old
spinster

break
down
by
more

forty
year
of
dulness
and
coarse
usage

<EOS>
It
be
easy
for
a
lad
of
spirit
to
master
her

<EOS>
and
whenever
George
want
anything
from
her
,
from
the
jam

pot
in

cupboard
to
the

Georgy
take
possession
of
the

which
obtain

he
take
no

It

delight

the

she

"
who

the

<EOS>
He
could

<EOS>
Georgy

<EOS>
how
be
little
George
to
respect
a

so
prostrate

<EOS>
a
few
month
after
he

with
his

Mrs.
Sedley
die
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
little
love
between

<EOS>
He
do
not

to
show
much

<EOS>
He
come
down
to
visit
his

in
a
fine

mourning

and
be
very
angry
that
he

<EOS>
the

perhaps
the

of
Amelia

<EOS>
what
do

know
about

<EOS>
We
should
go

ceaseless

<EOS>
Her
illness

estrangement
do
not
affect
Amelia

They

soothe

such

her
pious
simple

best
feel

utter

and
close
the

His

<EOS>
Can

"
  
<EOS>
the

flush
up

as
it

<EOS>
"
I

indeed

His

"

"
hundred

<EOS>
Eothen
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
many
cause
for
personal
pride
with
which
old
Osborne
choose
to
recreate
himself
that
Sedley
,
his
ancient
rival
,
enemy
,
and
benefactor
,
be
in
his
last
day
so
utterly
defeat
and
humiliate
as
to
be
force
to
accept
pecuniary
obligation
at
the
hand
of
the
man
who
have
most
injure
and
insult
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
successful
man
of
the
world
curse
the
old
pauper
and
relieve
him
from
time
to
time
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
furnish
George
with
money
for
his
mother
,
he
give
the
boy
to
understand
by
hint
,
deliver
in
his
brutal
,
coarse
way
,
that
George
's
maternal
grandfather
be
but
a
wretched
old
bankrupt
and
dependant
,
and
that
John
Sedley
may
thank
the
man
to
whom
he
already
owe
ever
so
much
money
for
the
aid
which
his
generosity
now
choose
to
administer
.
<EOS>
George
carry
the
pompous
supply
to
his
mother
and
the
shatter
old
widower
whom
it
be
now
the
main
business
of
her
life
to
tend
and
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
fellow
patronize
the
feeble
and
disappointed
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
show
a
want
of
"
proper
pride
"
in
Amelia
that
she
choose
to
accept
these
money
benefit
at
the
hand
of
her
father
's
enemy
.
<EOS>
but
proper
pride
and
this
poor
lady
have
never
have
much
acquaintance
together
.
<EOS>
a
disposition
naturally
simple
and
demand
protection
;
a
long
course
of
poverty
and
humility
,
of
daily
privation
,
and
hard
word
,
of
kind
office
and
no
return
,
have
be
her
lot
ever
since
womanhood
almost
,
or
since
her
luckless
marriage
with
George
Osborne
.
<EOS>
You
who
see
your
better
bear
up
under
this
shame
every
day
,
meekly
suffer
under
the
slight
of
fortune
,
gentle
and
unpitied
,
poor
,
and
rather
despise
for
their
poverty
,
do
you
ever
step
down
from
your
prosperity
and
wash
the
foot
of
these
poor
weary
beggar
?
<EOS>
the
very
thought
of
them
be
odious
and
low
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
must
be
class
 
<EOS>
there
must
be
rich
and
poor
,
"
Dives
say
,
smack
his
claret
(
it
be
well
if
he
even
send
the
broken
meat
out
to
Lazarus
sit
under
the
window
)
.
<EOS>
very
true
;
but
think
how
mysterious
and
often
unaccountable
it
be
 
that
lottery
of
life
which
give
to
this
man
the
purple
and
fine
linen
and
send
to
the
other
rag
for
garment
and
dog
for
comforter
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
must
own
that
,
without
much
repining
,
on
the
contrary
with
something
akin
to
gratitude
,
Amelia
take
the
crumb
that
her
father
-
in
-
law
let
drop
now
and
then
,
and
with
them
feed
her
own
parent
.
<EOS>
directly
she
understand
it
to
be
her
duty
,
it
be
this
young
woman
's
nature
(
lady
<EOS>
,
she
be
but
thirty
still
,
and
we
choose
to
call
her
a
young
woman
even
at
that
age
)
<EOS>
it
be
,
I
say
,
her
nature
to
sacrifice
herself
and
to
fle
all
that
she
have
at
the
foot
of
the
beloved
object
.
 
<EOS>
during
what
long
thankless
night
have
she
work
out
her
finger
for
little
Georgy
whilst
at
home
with
her
;
what
buffet
,
scorn
,
privation
,
poverty
have
she
endure
for
father
and
mother
!
<EOS>
and
in
the
midst
of
all
these
solitary
resignation
and
unseen
sacrifice
,
she
do
not
respect
herself
any
more
than
the
world
respect
her
,
but
I
believe
think
in
her
heart
that
she
be
a
poor
-
spirited
,
despicable
little
creature
,
whose
luck
in
life
be
only
too
good
for
her
merit
.
 
<EOS>
o
you
poor
woman
!
 
<EOS>
o
you
poor
secret
martyr
and
victim
,
whose
life
be
a
torture
,
who
be
stretch
on
rack
in
your
bedroom
,
and
who
lie
your
head
down
on
the
block
daily
at
the
drawing
-
room
table
;
every
man
who
watch
your
pain
,
or
peer
into
those
dark
place
where
the
torture
be
administer
to
you
,
must
pity
you
 
and
 
and
thank
God
that
he
have
a
beard
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
see
,
year
ago
,
at
the
prison
for
idiot
and
madman
at
Bicetre
,
near
Paris
,
a
poor
wretch
bend
down
under
the
bondage
of
his
imprisonment
and
his
personal
infirmity
,
to
whom
one
of
our
party
give
a
halfpenny
worth
of
snuff
in
a
cornet
or
"
screw
"
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
the
kindness
be
too
much
for
the
poor
epileptic
creature
.
<EOS>
He
cry
in
an
anguish
of
delight
and
gratitude
:
 
if
anybody
give
you
and
me
a
thousand
a
year
,
or
save
our
life
,
we
could
not
be
so
affected

<EOS>
and
so
,
if
you
properly
tyrannize

some

to

thankless
sick

be

They
bury
Amelia

mother
in
the
churchyard
at
Brompton
,
upon
just
such
a
rainy
,
dark
day
as
Amelia
recollect
when
first
she
have
be
there
to
marry
George
.
<EOS>
Her
little
boy
sit
by
her
side
in
pompous
new
sable

<EOS>
She
remember
the
old
pew
-
woman
and
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thought
be
away
in
other
time
as
the
parson
read

<EOS>
but
that
she
hold
George
's
hand
in
her
own
,
perhaps
she
would
have
like
to
change
place
with
....
<EOS>
then
,
as
usual
,
she
feel
ashamed
of
her
selfish
thought
and
pray
inwardly
to
be
strengthen
to
do
her
duty
.
  
<EOS>
so
she
determine
with
all
her
might
and
strength
to
try
and
make
her
old

happy
.
 
<EOS>
She
slave

toil

patch

and
mend
,
sing
and
play
backgammon
,
read
out
the
newspaper
,
cook
dish
for
old
Sedley
,
walk
him
out
sedulously
into
Kensington
Gardens
or
the
Brompton
Lanes
,
listen
to
his
story
with
untire
smile
and
affectionate
hypocrisy
,
or
sit
muse
by
his
side
and
commune
with
her
own
thought
and
reminiscence
,
as
the
old
man
,
feeble
and
querulous
,
sun
himself
on
the
garden
bench
and
prattle
about
his
wrong
or
his
sorrow

<EOS>
what
sad

unsatisfactory
thought
those
of

be
!
 
<EOS>
the

run
up

down
the

broad
path
in

remind
her
of
George

who

the

take

;
her
selfish

guilty
love

in
both

have
be
rebuke

<EOS>
She
strove
to
think
it
be
right
that
she

so
punish

<EOS>
She
be
such
a
miserable
wicked
sinner
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
alone
in

<EOS>
I
know
that
the
account
of
this
kind
of
solitary
imprisonment
be
insufferably
tedious
,
unless
there
be
some
cheerful
or
humorous
incident
to
enliven
it
 
a
tender
gaoler
,
for
instance
,
or
a
waggish
commandant
of
the
fortress
,
or
a
mouse
to
come
out
and
play
about
Latude
's
beard
and
whisker
,
or
a
subterranean
passage
under
the
castle
,
dig
by
Trenck
with
his
nail
and
a
toothpick
:
 
<EOS>
the
historian
have
no
such
enlivening
incident
to
relate
in
the
narrative
of
Amelia
's
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
Fancy
her
,
if
you
please
,
during
this
period
,
very
sad
,
but
always
ready
to
smile
when
speak
to
;
in
a
very
mean
,
poor
,
not
to
say
vulgar
position
of
life
;
singe
song
,
make
pudding
,
play
card
,
mend
stocking
,
for
her
old
father
's
benefit
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
never
mind
,
whether
she
be
a
heroine
or
no
;
or
you
and
I
,
however
old
,
scold
,
and
bankrupt
 
<EOS>
may
we
have
in
our
last
day
a
kind
soft
shoulder
on
which
to
lean
and
a
gentle
hand
to
soothe
our
gouty
old
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Sedley
grow
very
fond
of
his
daughter
after
his
wife
's
death
,
and
Amelia
have
her
consolation
in
do
her
duty
by
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
be
not
go
to
leave
these
two
people
long
in
such
a
low
and
ungenteel
station
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
well
day
,
as
far
as
worldly
prosperity
go
,
be
in
store
for
both
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
ingenious
reader
have
guess
who
be
the
stout
gentleman
who
call
upon
Georgy
at
his
school
in
company
with
our
old
friend
Major
Dobbin
.
<EOS>
It
be
another
old
acquaintance
return
to
England
,
and
at
a
time
when
his
presence
be
likely
to
be
of
great
comfort
to
his
relative
there
.
  
<EOS>
Major
Dobbin
have
easily
succeed
in
get
leave
from
his
good
-
natured
commandant
to
proceed
to
Madras
,
and
thence
probably
to
Europe
,
on
urgent
private
affair
,
never
cease
travel
night
and
day
until
he
reach
his
journey
's
end
,
and
have
direct
his
march
with
such
celerity
that
he
arrive
at
Madras
in
a
high
fever
.
 
<EOS>
His
servant
who
accompany
him
bring
him
to
the
house
of
the
friend
with
whom
he
have
resolve
to
stay
until
his
departure
for
Europe
in
a
state
of
delirium
;
and
it
be
think
for
many
,
many
day
that
he
would
never
travel
farther
than
the
burying
-
ground
of
the
church
of
St.
 
George
's
,
where
the
troop
should
fire
a
salvo
over
his
grave
,
and
where
many
a
gallant
officer
lie
far
away
from
his
home
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
as
the
poor
fellow
lie
toss
in
his
fever
,
the
people
who
watch
him
may
have
hear
him
rave
about
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
that
he
should
never
see
her
again
depress
him
in
his
lucid
hour
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
his
last
day
be
come
,
and
he
make
his
solemn
preparation
for
departure
,
set
his
affair
in
this
world
in
order
and
leave
the
little
property
of
which
he
be
possess
to
those
whom
he
most
desire
to
benefit
.
 
<EOS>
the
friend
in
whose
house
he
be
locate
witness
his
testament
.
 
<EOS>
He
desire
to
be
bury
with
a
little
brown
hair
-
chain
which
he
wear
round
his
neck
and
which
,
if
the
truth
must
be
know
,
he
have
get
from
Amelia
's
maid
at
Brussels
,
when
the
young
widow
's
hair
be
cut
off
,
during
the
fever
which
prostrate
her
after
the
death
of
George
Osborne
on
the
plateau
at
Mount
St.
 
John
.
  
<EOS>
He
recover
,
rally
,
relapse
again
,
<EOS>
have
undergo
such
a
process
of
blood
-
letting
and
calomel
as
show
the
strength
of
his
original
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
almost
a
skeleton
when
they
put
him
on
board
<EOS>
the
Ramchunder
East
Indiaman
,
Captain
Bragg
,
from
Calcutta
,
touch
at
Madras
,
and
so
weak
and
prostrate
that
his
friend
who
have
tend
him
through
his
illness
prophesy
that
the
honest
Major
would
never
survive
the
voyage
,
and
that
he
would
pass
some
morning
,
shroud
in
flag
and
hammock
,
over
the
ship
's
side
,
and
carry
down
to
the
sea
with
him
the
relic
that
he
wear
at
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
whether
it
be
the
sea
air
,
or
the
hope
which
spring
up
in
him
afresh
,
from
the
day
that
the
ship
spread
her
canvas
and
stand
out
of
the
road
towards
home
,
our
friend
begin
to
amend
,
and
he
be
quite
well
(
though
as
gaunt
as
a
greyhound
)
before
they
reach
the
Cape
.
 
<EOS>
"
Kirk
will
be
disappoint
of
his
majority
this
time
,
"
he
say
with
a
smile
;
"
he
will
expect
to
find
himself
gazetted
by
the
time
the
regiment
reach
home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
it
must
be
premise
that
while
the
Major
be
lie
ill
at
Madras
,
have
make
such
prodigious
haste
to
go
thither
,
the
gallant
  
th
,
which
have
pass
many
year
abroad
,
which
after
its
return
from
the
West
Indies
have
be
baulk
of
its
stay
at
home
by
the
Waterloo
campaign
,
and
have
be
order
from
flander
to
India
,
have
receive
order
home
;
and
the
major
may
have
accompany
his
comrade
,
have
he
choose
to
wait
for
their
arrival
at
Madras
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
not
inclined
to
put
himself
in
his
exhausted
state
again
under
the
guardianship
of
Glorvina
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Miss
O'Dowd
would
have
do
for
me
,
"
he
say
laughingly
to
a
fellow
-
passenger
,
"
if
we
have
have
her
on
board
,
and
when
she
have
sink
me
,
she
would
have
fall
upon
you
,
depend
upon
it
,
and
carry
you
in
as
a
prize
to
Southampton
,
Jos
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
for
indeed
it
be
no
other
than
our
stout
friend
who
be
also
a
passenger
on
board
the
Ramchunder
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
pass
ten
year
in
Bengal
.
<EOS>
constant
dinner
,
tiffin
,
pale
ale
and
claret
,
the
prodigious
labour
of
cutcherry
,
and
the
refreshment
of
brandy
-
pawnee
which
he
be
force
to
take
there
,
have
their
effect
upon
Waterloo
Sedley
.
<EOS>
a

be
pronounce
necessary

have
serve
his
full
time
in
India
and
have
fine
appointment
which
have
enable
him
to
lay
by

he
be
free
to
come
home
and
stay
with
a
good
pension
,
or
to
return
and
resume
that
rank
in
the
service
to
which
his
seniority
and
his
vast
talent
entitle
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
rather
thin
than
when
we
last
see
him
,
but
have
gain
in
majesty
and
solemnity
of
demeanour
.
<EOS>
He
have
resume
the
mustachio
to
which
his
service
at
Waterloo
entitle
him
,
and
swagger
about
on
deck
in
a
magnificent
velvet

with
a
gold
band
and
a
profuse
ornamentation
of
pin
and
jewellery
about

<EOS>
He
take
breakfast
in
his
cabin
and
dress
as
solemnly

as

He

<EOS>
that
oriental
menial
have
a
wretched
life
under
the
tyranny
of
Jos
Sedley
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
be
as
vain
of
his
person
as
a
woman
,
and
take
as
long
a
time
at
his
toilette
as
any
fading
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
the
youngster
among
the
passenger
,
Young
Chaffers
of
the
150th
,
and
poor
little
Ricketts
,
come
home
after
his
third
fever
,
use
to
draw
out
Sedley
at
the
cuddy
-
table
and
make
him
tell
prodigious
story
about
himself
and
his
exploit
against
tigers
and
Napoleon
.
<EOS>
He
be
great
when
he
visit
the
Emperor
's
tomb
at
Longwood
,
when
to
these
gentleman
and
the
young
officer
of
the
ship
,
Major
Dobbin
not
be

he
describe
the
whole
battle

all
but
announce
that
Napoleon
never
would
have
go
to
Saint

at
all
but
for
him

Jos

<EOS>
after
leave
St.

he
become
very
generous

dispose

a
great
quantity
of
ship

claret
,
preserve
meat
,
and
great
cask
pack
with
soda
-
water
,
bring
out
for
his
private
delectation
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
lady
on
board
;
the
Major
give
the
pas
of
precedency
to
the
civilian
,
so
that
he
be
the
first
dignitary
at
table
,
and
treat
by
Captain
Bragg
and
the
officer
of
the
Ramchunder
with
the
respect
which
his
rank
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
He
disappear
rather
in
a
panic
during
a
two

gale
,
in
which
he
have
the
porthole
of
his
cabin
batten
down
,
and
remain

when
on
their
passage
out

where
the
Reverend

be
a

but
,
for
common
reading
<EOS>
,
he
have
bring
a
stock
of
novel
and
play
which
he
lend
to
the
rest
of
the

,
and
render
himself
agreeable
to
all
by
his
kindness
and
condescension
.
  
<EOS>
many
and
many
a
night
as
the

be
cut
through
the
roar
dark
sea
,
<EOS>
the
moon
and
star
shine
overhead
and
the
bell
singe
out
the
watch
,
Mr.
Sedley
and
the
Major
would
sit
on
the
quarter
-
deck
of
the
vessel
talk
about
home
,
as
the
Major
smoke
his
cheroot
and
the
civilian
puff
at
the
hookah
which
his
servant
prepare
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
conversation
it
be
wonderful
with
what
perseverance
and
ingenuity
Major
Dobbin
would
manage
to
bring
the
talk
round
to
the
subject
of
Amelia
and
her
little
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
,
a
little
testy
about
his
father
's
misfortune
and
unceremonious
application
to
him
,
be
soothe
down
by
the
Major
,
who
point
out
the
elder
's
ill
fortune
and
old
age
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
perhaps
like
to
live
with
the
old
couple
,
whose
way
and
hour
may
not
agree
with
those
of
a
young
man
,
accustom
to
different
society
<EOS>
(
Jos
bow
at
this
compliment
)
;
but
,
the
Major
point
out
,
how
advantageous
it
would
be
for
Jos
Sedley
to
have
a
house
of
his
own
in
London
,
and
not
a
mere
bachelor
's
establishment
as
before
;
how
his
sister
Amelia
would
be
the
very
person
to
preside
over
it
;
how
elegant
,
how
gentle
she
be
,
and
of
what
refined
good
manner
.
<EOS>
He
recount
story
of
the
success
which
Mrs.
George
Osborne
have
have
in
former
day
at
Brussels
,
and
in
London
,
where
she
be
much

by
people
of
very
great
fashion
;
and
he
then
hint
how
become
it
would
be
for
Jos
to
send
Georgy
to
a
good
school
and
make
a
man
of
him
,
for
his
mother
and
her
parent
would
be
sure
to
spoil
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
this
artful
Major
make
the
civilian
promise
to
take
charge
of
Amelia
and
her
unprotected
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
as
yet
what
event
have
happen
in
the
little
Sedley
family
,
and
how
death
have
remove
the
mother
,
and
rich
have
carry
off
George
from
Amelia
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
fact
be
that
every
day
and
always
,
this
love
-
smite
and
middle

aged
gentleman
be
think
about
Mrs.
Osborne
,
and
his
whole
heart
be
bent
upon

her
good

<EOS>
He
coax
,
wheedle
,
cajoled
,
and
compliment
Jos
Sedley
with
a
perseverance
and
cordiality
of
which
he
be
not
aware
himself
,
very
likely
;
but
some
man
who
have
unmarried
sister
or
daughter
even
,
may
remember
how
uncommonly
agreeable
gentleman
be
to
the
male
relation
when
they
be
court
the
female
;
and
perhaps
this
rogue
of
a
Dobbin
be
urge
by
a
similar
hypocrisy
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
when
Major
Dobbin
come
on
board
the
Ramchumder
,
very
sick
,
and
for
the
three
day
she
lie
in
the
Madras
Roads
,
he
do
not
begin
to
rally
,
nor
do
even
the
appearance
and
recognition
of
his
old
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Sedley
,
on
board
much
cheer
him
,
until
after
a
conversation
which
they
have
one
day
,
as
the
Major
be
lay
languidly
on
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
then
he
think
he
be
doom
;
he
have
leave
a
little
something
to
his
godson
in
his
will
,
and
he
trust
Mrs.
Osborne
would
remember
him
kindly
and
be
happy
in
the
marriage
she
be
about
to
make
.
"
<EOS>
married
?
<EOS>
not
the
least
,
"
Jos
answer
;
"
he
have
hear
from
her
:
 
she
make
no
mention
of
the
marriage
,
and
by
the
way
,
it
be
curious
,
she
write
to
say
that
Major
Dobbin
be
go
to
be
married
,
and
hope
that
he
would
be
happy
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
date
of
Sedley
's
letter
from
Europe
?
<EOS>
the
civilian
fetch
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
two
month
later
than
the
Major

and
the
ship

surgeon
congratulate
himself
upon
the
treatment
adopt
by
him
towards
his
new
patient

who
have
be
consign

the

and
thus
it
be
that
deserve
officer
,
Captain
Kirk

be
disappoint
of
his
majority
.
  
<EOS>
after
they
pass
St.
 
Helena
,
Major
Dobbin
's
gaiety
and
strength
be
such
as
to
astonish
all
his
fellow

<EOS>
He
lark
with
the
midshipman
,
play
single

stick
with
the
mate
,
run
up
the
shroud
like
a

,
sing
a
comic
song
one
night
to
the
amusement
of
the
whole
party
assemble
over
their
grog
after
supper
,
and
render
himself
so
gay
,
lively
,
and
amiable
that
even
Captain
Bragg
,
who
think
there
be
nothing
in
his
passenger

and
consider
he
be
a
poor

spirited
feller
at
first
,
be
constrain
to
own
that
the
Major
be
a
reserved

well

inform
and
meritorious
officer

<EOS>
"
He
be
not

Bragg
observe

and
thus
Captain
Bragg
show
that
he
possess
discrimination
as
a
man
,
as
well
as
ability
as

<EOS>
but
a
calm
take
place
when
the
Ramchunder

Dobbin
become
so
impatient

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Good
God

how

<EOS>
Our
friend
the
major
 
<EOS>
Our
Major
have
render
himself
so
popular
on
board
the
Ramchunder
that
when
he
and
Mr.
Sedley
descend
into
the
welcome
shore
-
boat
which
be
to
take
them
from
the
ship
,
the
whole
crew
,
man
and
officer
,
the
great
Captain
Bragg
himself
lead
off
,
give
three
cheer
for
Major
Dobbin
,
who
blush
very
much
and
duck
his
head
in
token
of
thank
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
,
who
very
likely
think
the
cheer
be
for
himself
,
take
off
his
gold
-
laced
cap
and
wave
it
majestically
to
his
friend
,
and
they
be
pull
to
shore
and
land
with
great
dignity
at
the
pier
,
whence
they
proceed
to
the
Royal
George
Hotel
.
  
<EOS>
although
the
sight
of
that
magnificent
round
of
beef
,
and
the
silver
tankard
suggestive
of
real
british
home
-
brew
ale
and
porter
,
which
perennially
greet
the
eye
of
the
traveller
return
from
foreign
part
who
enter
the
coffee
-
room
of
the
George
,
be
so
invigorating
and
delightful
that
a
man
enter
such
a
comfortable
snug
homely
english
inn
may
well
like
to
stop
some
day
there
,
yet
Dobbin
begin
to
talk
about
a
post
-
chaise
instantly
,
and
be
no
sooner
at
Southampton
than
he
wish
to
be
on
the
road
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
,
however
,
would
not
hear
of
move
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
why
be
he
to
pass
a
night
in
a
post
-
chaise
instead
of
a
great
large
undulating
downy
feather
-
bed
which
be
there
ready
to
replace
the
horrid
little
narrow
crib
in
which
the
portly
Bengal
gentleman
have
be
confine
during
the
voyage
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
think
of
move
till
his
baggage
be
clear
,
or
of
travel
until
he
could
do
so
with
his
chillum
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
Major
be
force
to
wait
over
that
night
,
and
dispatch
a
letter
to
his
family
announce
his
arrival
,
entreat
from
Jos
a
promise
to
write
to
his
own
friend
.
<EOS>
Jos
promise
,
but
do
not
keep
his
promise
.
 
<EOS>
the
Captain
,
the
surgeon
,
and
one
or
two
passenger
come
and
dine
with
our
two
gentleman
at
the
inn
<EOS>
,
Jos
exert
himself
in
a
sumptuous
way
in
order
the
dinner
and
promising
to
go
to
town
the
next
day
with
the
Major
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
say
it
do
his
eye
good
to
see
Mr.
Sedley
take
off
his
first
pint
of
porter
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
time
and
dare
to
enter
into
digression
,
I
would
write
a
chapter
about
that
first
pint
of
porter
drink
upon
english
ground
.
<EOS>
ah
,
how
good
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
worth
-
while
to
leave
home
for
a
year
,
just
to
enjoy
that
one
draught
.
  
<EOS>
Major
Dobbin
make
his
appearance
the
next
morning
very
neatly
shave
and
dress
,
accord
to
his
will
not
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
so
early
in
the
morning
that
nobody
be
up
in
the
house
except
that
wonderful
boot
of
an
inn
who
never
seem
to
want
sleep
;
and
the
Major
could
hear
the
snore
of
the
various
inmate
of
the
house
roar
through
the
corridor
as
he
creak
about
in
those
dim
passage
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
sleepless
boot
go
shirk
round
from
door
to
door
,
gather
up
at
each
the
Bluchers
,
Wellingtons
,
Oxonians
,
which
stand
outside
.
<EOS>
then
Jos
's
native
servant
arise
and
begin
to
get
ready
his
master
's
ponderous
dressing
apparatus
and
prepare
his
hookah
;
then
the
maidservant
get
up
,
and
meet
the
dark
man
in
the
passage
,
shriek
,
and
mistake
him
for
the
devil
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Dobbin
stumble
over
their
pail
in
the
passage
as
they
be
scour
the
deck
of
the
Royal
George
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
first
unshorn
waiter
appear
and
unbarred
the
door
of
the
inn
,
the
major
think
that
the
time
for
departure
be
arrive
,
and
order
a
post
-
chaise
to
be
fetch
instantly
,
that
they
may
set
off
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
direct
his
step
to
Mr.
Sedley
's
room
and
open
the
curtain
of
the
great
large
family
bed
wherein
Mr.
Jos
be
snore
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
up
!
<EOS>
Sedley

"
the
Major
say
,
"
it
be
time
to
be
off
;
the
chaise

the
door
in
half
an
hour

"
  
<EOS>
Jos
growl
from
under
the
counterpane
to
know
what
the
time
be
;
but
when
he
at
last
extort
from
the
blush
Major
(
who
never
tell
fibs
,
however
they
may
be
to
his
advantage
)
<EOS>
what
be
the
real
hour
of
the
morning
,
he
break
out
into
a
volley
of
bad
language
,
which
we
will
not
repeat
here
,
but
by
which
he
give
Dobbin
to
understand
that
he
would
jeopardy
his
soul
if
he
get
up
at
that
moment
,
that
the
Major
may
go
and
be
hang
,
that
he
would
not
travel
with
Dobbin
,
and
that
it
be
most
unkind
and
ungentlemanlike
to
disturb
a
man
out
of
his
sleep
in
that
way
;
on
which
the
discomfited
Major
be
oblige
to
retreat
,
leave
Jos
to
resume
his
interrupted
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
the
chaise
come
up
presently
,
and
the
Major
would
wait
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
an
english
nobleman

on
a
pleasure
tour
,
or
a

quickly

through
all
this
from
Southampton
to
London

and
without

<EOS>
You
see
he
be
so
eager
to
see
his

He

His

much
shaken
,
"
Emmy
whisper
as
Dobbin
go
up
and
cordially
shake
hand
with
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
although
he
have
such
particular
business
in
London
that
evening
,
the
Major
consent
to
forego
it
upon
Mr.
Sedley
's
invitation
to
him
to
come
home
and
partake
of
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
put
her
arm
under
that
of
her
young
friend
with
the
yellow
shawl
and
head
the
party
on
their
return
homeward
,
so
that
Mr.
Sedley
fall
to
Dobbin
's
share
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
walk
very
slowly
and
tell
a
number
of
ancient
history
about
himself
and
his
poor
Bessy
,
his
former
prosperity
,
and
his
bankruptcy
.
 
<EOS>
His
thought
,
as
be
usual
with
fail
old
man
,
be
quite
in
former
time
.
<EOS>
the
present
,
with
the
exception
of
the
one
catastrophe
which
he
feel
,
he
know
little
about
.
 
<EOS>
the
Major
be
glad
to
let
him
talk
on
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
be
fix
upon
the
figure
in
front
of
him
 
the
dear
little
figure
always
present
to
his
imagination
and
in
his
prayer
,
and
visit
his
dream
wakeful
or
slumbering
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
be
very
happy
,
smile
,
and
active
all
that
evening
,
perform
her
duty
as
hostess
of
the
little
entertainment
with
the
utmost
grace
and
propriety
,
as
Dobbin
think
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
follow
her
about
as
they
sit
in
the
twilight
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
a
time
have
he
long
for
that
moment
and
thought
of
her
far
away
under
hot
wind
and
in
weary
marche
,
gentle
and
happy
,
kindly
minister
to
the
want
of
old
age
,
and
decorate
poverty
with
sweet
submission
 
as
he
see
her
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
his
taste
be
the
high
,
or
that
it
be
the
duty
of
great
intellect
to
be
content
with
a
bread
-
and
-
butter
paradise
,
such
as
suffice
our
simple
old
friend
;
but
his
desire
be
of
this
sort
,
whether
for
good
or
bad
,
and
,
with
Amelia
to
help
him
,
he
be
as
ready
to
drink
as
many
cup
of
tea
as
Doctor
Johnson
.
  
<EOS>
Amelia
see
this
propensity
,
laughingly
encourage
it
and
look
exceedingly
roguish
as
she
administer
to
him
cup
after
cup
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
<EOS>
she
do
not
know
that
the
Major
have
have
no
dinner
and
that
the
cloth
be
lay
for
him
at
the
Slaughters
'
,
and
a
plate
lay
thereon
to
mark
that
the
table
be
retain
,
in
that
very
box
in
which
the
Major
and
George
have
sit
many
a
time
carouse
<EOS>
,
when
she
be
a
child
just
come
home
from
Miss
Pinkerton
's
school
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
Mrs.
Osborne
show
the
Major
be
Georgy
's
miniature
,
for
which
she
run
upstairs
on
her
arrival
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
half
handsome
enough
of
course
for
the
boy
,
but
be
not
it
noble
of
him
to
think
of
bring
it
to
his
mother
?
<EOS>
whilst
her
papa
be
awake
<EOS>
she
do
not
talk
much
about
Georgy
.
 
<EOS>
to
hear
about
Mr.
Osborne
and
Russell
Square
be
not
agreeable
to
the
old
man
,
who
very
likely
be
unconscious
that
he
have
be
live
for
some
month
past
mainly
on
the
bounty
of
his
rich
rival
,
and
lose
his
temper
if
allusion
be
make
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
Dobbin
tell
him
all
,
and
a
little
more
perhaps
than
all
,
that
have
happen
on
board
the
Ramchunder
,
and
exaggerate
Jos
's
benevolent
disposition
towards
his
father
and
resolution
to
make
him
comfortable
in
his
old
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
that
during
the
voyage
the
Major
have
impress
this
duty
most
strongly
upon
his
fellow
-
passenger
and
extort
promise
from
him
that
he
would
take
charge
of
his
sister
and
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
soothe
Jos
's
irritation
with
regard
to
the
bill
which
the
old
gentleman
have
draw
upon
him
,
give
a
laugh
account
of
his
own
suffering
on
the
same
score
and
of
the
famous
consignment
of
wine
with
which
the
old
man
have
favour
him
,
and
bring
Mr.
Jos
,
who
be
by
no
mean
an
ill
-
natured
person
when
well
-
pleased
and
moderately
flatter
,
to
a
very
good
state
of
feeling
regard
his
relative
in
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
and
in
fine
I
be
ashamed
to
say
that
the
Major
stretch
the
truth
so
far
as
to
tell
old
Mr.
Sedley
that
it
be
mainly
a
desire
to
see
his
parent
which
bring
Jos
once
more
to
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
accustomed
hour
Mr.
Sedley
begin
to
doze
in
his
chair
,
and
then
it
be
Amelia
's
opportunity
to
commence
her
conversation
,
which
she
do
with
great
eagerness
 
<EOS>
it
relate
exclusively
to
Georgy
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
talk
at
all
about
her
own
suffering
at
break
from
him
,
for
indeed
,
this
worthy
woman
,
though
she
be
half
-
kill
by
the
separation
from
the
child
,
yet
think
it
be
very
wicked
in
her
to
repine
at
lose
him
;
but
<EOS>
everything
concern
him
,
his
virtue
,
talent
,
and
prospect
,
she
pour
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
describe
his
angelic
beauty
;
narrate
a
hundred
instance
of
his
generosity
and
greatness
of
mind
whilst
live
with
her
;
how
a
Royal
Duchess
have
stop
and
admire
him
in
Kensington
Gardens
<EOS>
;
how
splendidly
he
be
care
for
now
,
and
how
he
have
a
groom
and
a
pony
;
what
quickness
and
cleverness
he
have
,
and
what
a
prodigiously
well
-
read
and
delightful
person
the
Reverend
Lawrence
Veal
be
,
George
's
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
know
everything
,
"
Amelia
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
the
most
delightful
party
.
 
<EOS>
You
who
be
so
learn
yourself
,
and
have
read
so
much
,
and
be
so
clever
and
accomplished
 
do
not
shake
your
head
and
say
no
 
he
always
use
to
say
you
be
 
<EOS>
you
will
be
charm
with
Mr.
Veal
's
party
.
<EOS>
the
last
Tuesday
in
every
month
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
there
be
no
place
in
the
bar
or
the
senate
that
Georgy
may
not
aspire
to
.
 
<EOS>
look
here
,
"
and
she
go
to
the
piano
-
drawer
and
draw
out
a
theme
of
Georgy
's
composition
.
 
<EOS>
this
great
effort
of
genius
,
which
be
still
in
the
possession
of
George
's
mother
,
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
on
selfishness
 
of
all
the
vice
which
degrade
the
human
character
,
Selfishness
be
the
most
odious
and
contemptible
.
 
<EOS>
an
undue
love
of
self
lead
to
the
most
monstrous
crime
and
occasion
the
great
misfortune
both
in
States
and
Families
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
selfish
man
will
impoverish
his
family
and
often
bring
them
to
ruin
,
so
a
selfish
king
bring
ruin
on
his
people
and
often
plunge
them
into
war
.
  
<EOS>
example
:
 
<EOS>
the
selfishness
of
Achilles
,
as
remark
by
the
poet
Homer
,
occasion
a
thousand
woe
to
the
Greeks
 
muri
Achaiois
alge
etheke
 
<EOS>
(
Hom

.
<EOS>
the
selfishness
of
the
late
Napoleon
Bonaparte
occasion
innumerable
war
in
Europe
and
cause
him
to
perish
,
himself
,
in
a
miserable
island
 
that
of
Saint
Helena
in
the
Atlantic
Ocean
.
  
<EOS>
We
see
by
these
example
that
we
be
not
to
consult
our
own
interest
and
ambition
,
but
that
we
be
to
consider
the
interest
of
other
as
well
as
our
own

Jos
,
although
provide
with
some
of
the
most
splendid
vest
that
Calcutta
could
furnish
,
think
he
could
not
go
to
town
until
he
be
supply
with
one
or
two
of
these
garment
,
and
select
a
crimson
satin
,
embroider
with
gold
butterfly
,
and
a
black
and
red
velvet
tartan
with
white
stripe
and
a
rolling
collar
,
with
which
,
and
a
rich
blue
satin
stock
and
a
gold
pin
,
consist
of
a
five

bar
gate
with
a
horseman
in
pink
enamel
jump
over
it
,
he
think
he
may
make
his
entry
into
London
with
some
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
for
Jos
's
former
shyness
and
blunder
blush
timidity
have
give
way
to
a
more
candid
and
courageous
self
-
assertion
of
his
worth
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
about
own
it
,
"
Waterloo
Sedley
would
say
to
his
friend
,
"
I
be
a
dressy
man
"
;
and
though
rather
uneasy
if
the
lady
look
at
him
at
the
Government
House
ball
,
and
though
he
blush
and
turn
away
alarm
under
their
glance
,
it
be
chiefly
from
a
dread
lest
they
should
make
love
to
him
that
he
avoid
them
,
be
averse
to
marriage
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
such
swell
in
Calcutta
as
Waterloo
Sedley
<EOS>
,
I
have
hear
say

and
he
have
the
handsome
turn

out
,
give
the
good
bachelor
dinner
,
and
have
the
fine
plate
in
the
whole
place
.
  
<EOS>
to
make
these
waistcoat
for
a
man
of
his
size
and
dignity
take
at
least
a
day
,
part
of
which
he
employ
in
hire
a
servant
to
wait
upon
him
and
his
native
and
in
instruct
the
agent
who
clear
his
baggage
,
his

his

which

his

his

and
the
rest

<EOS>
at
length
,
he
drive
leisurely
to
London
on
the
third
day

in
the
new
waistcoat
,
the
native
,
with
chatter
tooth
,
shudder
in
a
shawl
on
the
box
by
the
side
of
the
new
european
servant
;
Jos
puff
his
pipe
at
interval
within
and
look
so
majestic
that
the
little
boy
cry
Hooray
,
and
many
people
think
he
must
be
a
Governor
-
General
.
 
<EOS>
he
,
I
promise
,
do
not
decline
the
obsequious
invitation
of
the
landlord
to
alight
and
refresh
himself
in
the
neat

at
Southampton

he
have
so
far
rally
at
Winchester
as
to
think
a
glass
of
sherry
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
at
Alton
he
step
out
of
the
carriage
at
his
servant
's
request
and
imbibe
some
of
the
ale
for
which
the
place
be
famous

<EOS>
at
Farnham
he
stop
to
view
the

partake
of
a
light
dinner
of
stewed
eel

veal

with
a

<EOS>
He
be
cold
over
Bagshot
Heath

where
the
native
chatter
more

more

and
Jos
Sahib
take
some
brandy

and
-
water
;
in
fact
,
when
he

into
town
he
be
as
full
of
wine
,
beer
,
meat
,
pickle
,
cherry

brandy
,
and
tobacco
as
the
steward

<EOS>
It
be
evening
when
his

thunder
up
to
the
little
door
in
Brompton

whither
the
affectionate
fellow
drive
first
,
and
before

apartment
secure
for

by
Mr.

<EOS>
all
the
face
in

street

in
the
window
;
the
little
maidservant
fly
to
the
wicket

gate
;
the
Mesdames
Clapp
look
out
from
the
casement
of
the

;
Emmy

in
a
great
flutter
,
be
in
the
passage
among
the
hat
and
coat

and
old
Sedley
in
the
parlour
inside
,
shake
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
descend
from
the
post
-
chaise
and
down
the
creaking
sway
step
in
awful
state
,
support
by
the
new
valet
from
Southampton
and
the
shuddering
native
,
whose
brown
face
be
now
livid
with
cold
and
of
the
colour
of
a
turkey
's
gizzard

<EOS>
He
create
an
immense
sensation
in
the
passage
presently
,
where
Mrs.
and
Miss
Clapp
,
come
perhaps
to
listen
at
the
parlour
door
,
find
Loll
Jewab
shake
upon
the
hall
-
bench
under
the
coat
,
moan
in
a
strange
piteous
way
,
and
show
his
yellow
eyeball
and
white
tooth
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
you
see
,
we
have
adroitly
shut
the
door
upon
the
meeting
between
Jos
and
the
old
father
and
the
poor
little
gentle
sister
inside
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
be
very
much
affected
;
so
,
of
course
,
be
his
daughter
;
nor
be
Jos
without
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
long
absence
of
ten
year
,
the
most
selfish
will
think
about
home
and
early
tie
.
<EOS>
distance
sanctify
both
.
<EOS>
long
brood
over
those
lose
pleasure
exaggerate
their
charm
and
sweetness
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
be
unaffectedly
glad
to
see
and
shake
the
hand
of
his
father
,
between
whom
and
himself
there
have
be
a
coolness
 
<EOS>
glad
to
see
his
little
sister
,
whom
he
remember
so
pretty
and
smile
,
and
pain
at
the
alteration
<EOS>
which
time
,
grief
,
and
misfortune
have
make
in
the
shatter
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
Emmy
have
come
out
to
the
door
in
her
black
clothe
and
whisper
to
him
of
her
mother
's
death
,
and
not
to
speak
of
it
to
their
father
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
of
this
caution
,
for
the
elder
Sedley
himself
begin
immediately
to
speak
of
the
event
,
and
prattle
about
it
,
and
weep
over
it
plenteously
.
<EOS>
It
shock
the
Indian
not
a
little
and
make
him
think
of
himself
less
than
the
poor
fellow
be
accustomed
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
result
of
the
interview
must
have
be
very
satisfactory
,
for
when
Jos
have
reascende
his
post
-
chaise
and
have
drive
away
to
his
hotel
,
Emmy
embrace
her
father
tenderly
,
appeal
to
him
with
an
air
of
triumph
,
and
ask
the
old
man
whether
she
do
not
always
say
that
her
brother
have
a
good
heart
?
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
Joseph
Sedley
,
affect
by
the
humble
position
in
which
he
find
his
relation
,
and
in
the
expansiveness
and
overflowing
of
heart
occasion
by
the
first
meeting
,
declare
that
they
should
never
suffer
want
or
discomfort
any
more
,
that
he
be
at
home
for
some
time
at
any
rate
,
during
which
his
house
and
everything
he
have
should
be
theirs
:
and
that
Amelia
would
look
very
pretty
at
the
head
of
his
table
 
until
she
would
accept
one
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
sadly
and
have
,
as
usual
,
recourse
to
the
waterworks
.
<EOS>
She
know
what
he
mean
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
young
confidante
,
Miss
Mary
,
have
talk
over
the
matter
most
fully
,
the
very
night
of
the
Major
's
visit
,
beyond
which
time
the
impetuous
Polly
could
not
refrain
from
talk
of
the
discovery
which
she
have
make
,
and
describe
the
start
and
tremor
of
joy
by
which
Major
Dobbin
betray
himself
when
Mr.
Binny
pass
with
his
bride
and
the
Major
learn
that
he
have
no
longer
a
rival
to
fear
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
see
how
he
shake
all
over
when
you
ask
if
he
be
married
and
he
say
,
"
who
tell
you
those
lie
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
m'am
,
"
polly
say
,
"
he
never
keep
his
eye
off
you
,
and
I
be
sure
he
be
grow
grey
athinking
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Amelia
,
look
up
at
her
bed
,
over
which
hang
the
portrait
of
her
husband
and
son
,
tell
her
young
protegee
never
,
never
,
to
speak
on
that
subject
again
;
that
Major
Dobbin
have
be
her
husband
's
dear
friend
and
her
own
and
George
's
most
kind
and
affectionate
guardian
;
that
she
love
him
as
a
brother
 
but
that
a
woman
who
have
be
marry
to
such
an
angel
as
that
,
and
she
point
to
the
wall
,
could
never
think
of
any
other
union
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Polly
sigh
:
 
<EOS>
she
think
what
she
should
do
if
young
Mr.
Tomkins
,
at
the
surgery
,
who
always
look
at
her
so
at
church
,
and
who
,
by
those
mere
aggressive
glance
have
put
her
timorous
little
heart
into
such
a
flutter
that
she
be
ready
to
surrender
at
once
,
 
what
she
should
do
if
he
be
to
die
?
<EOS>
She
know
he
be
consumptive
,
his
cheek
be
so
red
and
he
be
so
uncommon
thin
in
the
waist
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
Emmy
,
be
make
aware
of
the
honest
Major
's
passion
,
rebuff
him
in
any
way
,
or
feel
displeased
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
such
an
attachment
from
so
true
and
loyal
a
gentleman
could
make
no
woman
angry
.
<EOS>
Desdemona
be
not
angry
with
Cassio
,
though
there
be
very
little
doubt
she
see
the
Lieutenant
's
partiality
for
her
(
and
I
for
my
part
believe
that
many
more
thing
take
place
in
that
sad
affair
than
the
worthy
moorish
officer
ever
know
of
)
;
why
,
Miranda
be
even
very
kind
to
Caliban
,
and
we
may
be
pretty
sure
for
the
same
reason
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
would
encourage
him
in
the
least
 
the
poor
uncouth
monster
 
of
course
not
.
 
<EOS>
no
more
would
emmy
by
any
mean
encourage
her
admirer
,
the
Major
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
give
him
that
friendly
regard
,
which
so
much
excellence
and
fidelity
merit
;
she
would
treat
him
with
perfect
cordiality
and
frankness
until
he
make
his
proposal
,
and
then
it
would
be
time
enough
for
her
to
speak
and
to
put
an
end
to
hope
which
never
could
be
realize
.
  
<EOS>
She
sleep
,
therefore
,
very
soundly
that
evening
,
after
the
conversation
with
Miss
Polly
,
and
be
more
than
ordinarily
happy
,
in
spite
of
Jos
's
delaying

<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
he
be
not
go
to
marry
that
Miss
O'Dowd

"
<EOS>
Colonel
O'Dowd
never
could
have
a
sister
fit
for
such
an
accomplished
man
as
Major
William

"
who

there
amongst

him
a
good

not
Miss

Miss

old

Mrs.

anybody
to

the
landlord
of
the
George

take
a
glass

that
day

very
hour

Sir
William

it

impossible

comfortably
situate

St.

Lane

he
could
enjoy
his
hookah
there
with
such
perfect
ease

and
could
swagger
down
to
the
theatre
,
when
mind
,
so
agreeably

that

perhaps

he
would
have
remain
altogether

not
let
the
Bengalee
rest
until
he
have
execute
his
promise

have
a
home
for
Amelia

Jos
be
a
soft
fellow

It

Jos
to
superintend
the
building
of
a
smart
chariot

shortly
after
Jos

first
appearance

Brompton

humble
cottage
at
which

ten
year

as
any
that
have
be
outpoure
in
the
course
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
in
their
long
acquaintanceship
and
intimacy
they
could
not
recall
a
harsh
word
that
have
be
utter
by
Amelia
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
all
sweetness
and
kindness
,
always
thankful
,
always
gentle
,
even
when
Mrs.
Clapp
lose
her
own
temper
and
press
for
the
rent
.
<EOS>
when
the
kind
creature
be
go
away
for
good
and
all
,
the
landlady
reproach
herself
bitterly
for
ever
have
use
a
rough
expression
to
her
 
how
she
weep
,
as
they
stick
up
with
wafer
on
the
window
,
a
paper
notify
that
the
little
room
so
long
occupy
be
to
let
!
 
<EOS>
They
never
would
have
such
lodger
again
,
that
be
quite
clear
.
 
<EOS>
after
-
life
prove
the
truth
of
this
melancholy
prophecy
,
and
Mrs.
Clapp
revenge
herself
for
the
deterioration
of
mankind
by
levy
the
most
savage
contribution
upon
the
tea
-
caddie
and
leg
of
mutton
of
her
locataire
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
them
scold
and
grumble
;
some
of
them
do
not
pay
;
none
of
them
stay
.
<EOS>
the
landlady
may
well
regret
those
old
,
old
friend
,
who
have
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Miss
Mary
,
her
sorrow
at
Amelia
's
departure
be
such
as
I
shall
not
attempt
to
depict
.
 
<EOS>
from
childhood
upwards
she
have
be
with
her
daily
and
have
attach
herself
so
passionately
to
that
dear
good
lady
that
when
the
grand
barouche
come
to
carry
her
off
into
splendour
,
she
faint
in
the
arm
of
her
friend
,
who
be
indeed
scarcely
less
affected
than
the
good
-
natured
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
love
her
like
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
during
eleven
year
the
girl
have
be
her
constant
friend
and
associate
.
 
<EOS>
the
separation
be
a
very
painful
one
indeed
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
of
course
arrange
that
Mary
be
to
come
and
stay
often
at
the
grand
new
house
whither
Mrs.
Osborne
be
go
,
and
where
Mary
be
sure
she
would
never
be
so
happy
as
she
have
be
in
their
humble
cot
,
as
Miss
Clapp
call
it
,
in
the
language
of
the
novel
which
she
love
.
  
<EOS>
let
us
hope
she
be
wrong
in
her
judgement
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Emmy
's
day
of
happiness
have
be
very
few
in
that
humble
cot
.
 
<EOS>
a
gloomy
Fate
have
oppress
her
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
like
to
come
back
to
the
house
after
she
have
leave
it
,
or
to
face
the
landlady
who
have
tyrannize
over
her
when
ill
-
humoured
and
unpaid
,
or
when
pleased
have
treat
her
with
a
coarse
familiarity
scarcely
less
odious
.
<EOS>
Her
servility
and
fulsome
compliment
when
Emmy
be
in
prosperity
be
not
more
to
that
lady
's
liking
.
 
<EOS>
She
cast
about
note
of
admiration
all
over
the
new
house
,
extoll
every
article
of
furniture
or
ornament
;
she
finger
Mrs.
Osborne
's
dress
and
calculate
their
price
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
too
good
for
that
sweet
lady
,
she
vow
and
protest
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
vulgar
sycophant
who
now
pay
court
to
her
,
Emmy
always
remember
the
coarse
tyrant
who
have
make
her
miserable
many
a
time
,
to
whom
she
have
be
force
to
put
up
petition
for
time
,
when
the
rent
be
overdue
;
who
cry
out
at
her
extravagance
if
she
buy
delicacy
for
her
ail
mother
or
father
;
who
have
see
her
humble
and
trample
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
nobody
ever
hear
of
these
griefs
,
which
have
be
part
of
our
poor
little
woman
's
lot
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
keep
them
secret
from
her
father
,
whose
improvidence
be
the
cause
of
much
of
her
misery
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
to
bear
all
the
blame
of
his
misdoing
,
and
indeed
be
so
utterly
gentle
and
humble
as
to
be
make
by
nature
for
a
victim
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
she
be
not
to
suffer
much
more
of
that
hard
usage
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
in
all
griefs
there
be
say
to
be
some
consolation
<EOS>
,
I
may
mention
that
poor
Mary
,
when
leave
at
her
friend
's
departure
in
a
hysterical
condition
,
be
place
under
the
medical
treatment
of
the
young
fellow
from
the
surgery
,
under
whose
care
she
rally
after
a
short
period
.
<EOS>
Emmy
,
when
she
go
away
from
Brompton
,
endow
Mary
with
every
article
of
furniture
that
the
house
contain
,
only
take
away
her
picture
(
the
two
picture
over
the
bed
)
and
her
piano
 
that
little
old
piano
which
have
now
pass
into
a
plaintive
jingling
old
age
,
but
which
she
love
for
reason
of
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
child
when
first
she
play
on
it
,
and
her
parent
give
it
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
give
to
her
again
since
,
as
the
reader
may
remember
,
when
her
father
's
house
be
go
to
ruin
and
the
instrument
be
recover
out
of
the
wreck
.
  
<EOS>
Major
Dobbin
be
exceedingly
pleased
when
,
as
he
be
superintend
the
arrangement
of
Jos
's
new
house
 
which
the
Major
insist
should
be
very
handsome
and
comfortable
 
<EOS>
the
cart
arrive
from
Brompton
,
bring
the
trunk
and
bandbox
of
the
emigrant
from
that
village
,
and
with
them
the
old
piano
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
would
have
it
up
in
her
sitting
-
room
,
a
neat
little
apartment
on
the
second
floor
,
adjoin
her
father
's
chamber
,
and
where
the
old
gentleman
sit
commonly
of
evening
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
man
appear
then
bear
this
old
music
-
box
,
and
Amelia
give
order
that
it
should
be
place
in
the
chamber
<EOS>
aforesaid
,
Dobbin
be
quite
elated
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
have
keep
it
,
"
he
say
in
a
very
sentimental
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
do
not
care
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
value
it
more
than
anything
I
have
in
the
world
,
"
say
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
,
Amelia
?
"
cry
the
Major
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
as
he
have
buy
it
himself
,
though
he
never
say
anything
about
it
,
it
never
enter
into
his
head
to
suppose
that
Emmy
should
think
anybody
else
be
the
purchaser
,
and
as
a
matter
of
course
he
fancy
that
she
know
the
gift
come
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
,
Amelia
?
"
he
say
;
and
the
question
,
the
great
question
of
all
,
be
tremble
on
his
lip
,
when
Emmy
reply
    
"
Can
I
do
otherwise
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
he
give
it
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
poor
old
dob
,
and
his
countenance
fall
.
  
<EOS>
Emmy
do
not
note
the
circumstance
at
the
time
,
nor
take
immediate
heed
of
the
very
dismal
expression
which
honest
Dobbin
's
countenance
assume
,
but
she
think
of
it
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
strike
her
,
with
inexpressible
pain
and
mortification
too
,
that
it
be
William
who
be
the
giver
of
the
piano
,
and
not
George
,
as
she
have
fancy
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
George
's
gift
;
the
only
one
which
she
have
receive
from
her
lover
,
as
she
think
 
the
thing
she
have
cherish
beyond
all
other
 
her
dear
relic
and
prize
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
speak
to
it
about
George
;
play
his
favourite
air
upon
it
;
sit
for
long
evening
hour
,
touch
,
to
the
good
of
her
simple
art
,
melancholy
harmony
on
the
key
,
and
weep
over
them
in
silence
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
George
's
relic
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
valueless
now
.
<EOS>
the
next
time
that
old
Sedley
ask
her
to
play
,
she
say
it
be
shockingly
out
of
tune
,
that
she
have
a
headache
,
that
she
could
not
play
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
accord
to
her
custom
,
she
rebuke
herself
for
her
pettishness
and
ingratitude
and
determine
to
make
a
reparation
to
honest
William
for
the
slight
she
have
not
express
to
him
,
but
have
feel
for
his
piano
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
afterwards
,
as
they
be
seat
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
Jos
have
fall
asleep
with
great
comfort
after
dinner
,
Amelia
say
with
rather
a
falter
voice
to
Major
Dobbin
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
beg
your
pardon
for
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
about
what
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
 
about
that
little
square
piano
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thank
you
for
it
when
you
give
it
me
,
many
,
many
year
ago
,
before
I
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
somebody
else
have
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
thank
you
,
William
.
<EOS>
"
She
hold
out
her
hand
,
but
the
poor
little
woman
's
heart
be
bleed
;
and
as
for
her
eye
,
of
course
they
be
at
their
work
.
  
<EOS>
but
William
could
hold
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amelia
,
Amelia
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
do
buy
it
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
then
as
I
do
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
love
you
from
the
first
minute
that
I
see
you
,
when
George
bring
me
to
your
house
,
to
show
me
the
Amelia
whom
he
be
engage
to
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
but
a
girl
,
in
white
,
with
large
ringlet
;
you
come
down
singe
 
<EOS>
do
you
remember
?
 
<EOS>
and
we
go
to
Vauxhall
.
 
<EOS>
since
then
I
have
think
of
but
one
woman
in
the
world
,
and
that
be
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
no
hour
in
the
day
have
pass
for
twelve
year
that
I
have
not
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
tell
you
this
before
I
go
to
India
,
but
you
do
not
care
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
heart
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
care
whether
I
stay
or
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
ungrateful
,
"
Amelia
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
only
indifferent
,
"
Dobbin
continue
desperately
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
make
a
woman
to
be
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
be
feel
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
hurt
in
your
heart
at
the
discovery
about
the
piano
,
and
that
it
come
from
me
and
not
from
George
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgot
,
or
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
speak
of
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
for
me
to
ask
your
pardon
for
be
a
fool
for
a
moment
,
and
think
that
year
of
constancy
and
devotion
may
have
plead
with
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
you
who
be
cruel
now

Amelia
say
with
some
spirit
.

<EOS>
George
be
my
husband
,
here
and
in
heaven

<EOS>
how
could
I
love
any
other
but
him
?
<EOS>
I
be
his
now
as
when
you
first
see

William

It

generous

who
teach
me
to
love
you
as
a

<EOS>
have
you
not

everything
to
me
and
my
boy

<EOS>
Our
dear
,
true
,
kind
friend
and
protector

<EOS>
have
you
come
a
few
month
sooner
perhaps
you
may
have
spare
me
that
 
that
dreadful
parting

<EOS>
oh

William

but
you
do

<EOS>
and
here
her

<EOS>
the
Major
fold
his

round
her

hold
her
to
him
as
if
she
be
a

her

"
I

I
ask

I

He

always
respectful
to
Major
Dobbin
,
however
,
and
more
modest
in
his
demeanour
when
that
gentleman
be
present

<EOS>
He
be
a
clever
lad

afraid
of

George
could
not

's
simplicity
,
his
good
humour
,
his
various
learning
quietly
impart

his
general
love

justice

<EOS>
He
have
meet
no
such
man

yet
in
the
course
of

liking
for

<EOS>
He
hang
fondly

William

when
George
be
more
than
usually
pert
and
conceited
,
the
Major
make
joke
at
him
,
which
Mrs.
Osborne
think
very
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
take
him
to
the
play
,
and
the
boy
decline
to
go
into
the
pit
because
it
be
vulgar
,
the
Major
take
him
to
the
box
,
leave
him
there
,
and
go
down
himself
to
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
seat
there
very
long
before
he
feel
an
arm
thrust
under

a
dandy
little
hand
in
a

glove
squeeze
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
George
have
see
the
absurdity
of
his
way
and
come
down
from
the
upper
region
.
 
<EOS>
a
tender
laugh
of
benevolence
light
up
old
Dobbin
's
face
and
eye
as
he
look
at
the
repentant
little
prodigal
.
 
<EOS>
He
love
the
boy
,
as
he
do
everything
that
belong

<EOS>
how
charm
she

she
hear

this
instance

George

<EOS>
Her
eye
look
more
kindly
on
Dobbin
than
they
ever
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
blush
,
he
think
,
after
look
at
him
so
.
  
<EOS>
Georgy
never
tired
of
his
praise
of
the
Major
to
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
him
,
Mamma
,
because
he
know
such
lot
of
thing
;
and
he
be
not
like
old
Veal
,
who
be
always
brag
and
use
such
long
word
,
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
?
<EOS>
the
chap
call
him
"
Longtail
"
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
the
name
;
be
not
it
capital
?
<EOS>
but
Dob
read
latin
like
English
,
and
French
and
that
;
and
when
we
go
out
together
he
tell
me
story
about
my
papa
,
and
never
about
himself
;
though
I
hear
Colonel
Buckler
,
at
Grandpapa
's
,
say
that
he
be
one
of
the
brave
officer
in
the
army

have
distinguish
himself
ever
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
Grandpapa
be
quite
surprised
,
and
say
,
"
that
feller
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
do
not
think
he
could
say
Bo
to
a
goose
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
he
could
,
could
not
he
,
Mamma
?
"
  
<EOS>
Emmy
laugh
:
 
<EOS>
she
think
it
be
very
likely
the
Major
could
do
thus
much
.
  
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
sincere
liking
between
George
and
the
Major
,
it
must
be
confess
that
between
the
boy
and
his
uncle
<EOS>
no
great
love
exist
.
<EOS>
George
have
get
a
way
of
blow
out
his
cheek
,
and
put
his
hand
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
say
,
"
God
bless
my
soul
<EOS>
,
you
do
not
say
so
,
"
so
exactly
after
the
fashion
of
old
Jos
that
it
be
impossible
to
refrain
from
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
would
explode
at
dinner
if
the
lad
,
ask
for
something
which
be
not
at
table
,
put
on
that
countenance
and
use
that
favourite
phrase
.
 
<EOS>
even
Dobbin
would
shoot
out
a
sudden
peal
at
the
boy
's
mimicry
.
 
<EOS>
if
George
do
not
mimic
his
uncle
to
his
face
,
it
be
only
by
Dobbin
's
rebuke
and
Amelia
's
terrified
entreaty
that
the
little
scapegrace
be
induce
to
desist
.
<EOS>
and
the
worthy
civilian
be
haunt
by
a
dim
consciousness
that
the
lad
think
him
an
ass
,
and
be
incline
to
turn
him
into
ridicule
,
use
to
be
extremely
timorous
and
,
of
course
,
doubly
pompous
and
dignified
in
the
presence
of
Master
Georgy
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
announce
that
the
young
gentleman
be
expect
in
Gillespie
Street
to
dine
with
his
mother
,
Mr.
Jos
commonly
find
that
he
have
an
engagement
at
the
Club
.
<EOS>
perhaps
nobody
be
much
grieve
at
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
on
those
day
Mr.
Sedley
would
commonly
be
induce
to
come
out
from
his
place
of
refuge
in
the
upper
story
,
and
there
would
be
a
small
family
party
,
whereof
Major
Dobbin
pretty
generally
form
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the

<EOS>

Sedley
's

Emmy

Georgy

"
He
may
almost
as
well
be

Madras
for
anything
we

of
him

Miss
Ann
Dobbin
remark
at
Camberwell
.
 
<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
Miss
Ann
,
do
it
not
strike
you
that
it
be
not
you
whom
the
Major
want
to
marry

<EOS>
Joseph
Sedley
then
lead
a
life
of
dignified
otiosity
such
as
become
a
person
of
his
eminence
.
 
<EOS>
His
very
first
point
,
of
course
,
be
to
become
a
member
of
the
Oriental
Club
,
where
he
spend
his
morning
in
the
company
of
his

Indians

House
in
London
have
refuse
the
bill
draw
by
Thomson
,
Kibobjee

and
Co.

the
Bombay

and
how
it
be
think
the
Calcutta
House
must
go
too
;
how
very
imprudent
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
Mrs.
Brown
's
conduct
(
wife
of
Brown
of

Ahmednuggur
Irregulars

up

on

Felix

<EOS>
this

similar
talk

and
why

<EOS>
only
I

the
period
of

for

death
be
only
just

Jos
scarcely

have
time
to
cast
off
his
black

appear
in
the
splendid

which
he
love

when
it
become
evident
to
those
about
Mr.

that
another
event
be
at
hand
,
and
that
the
old
man
be
about
to
go
seek
for
his
wife
in
the
dark
land
whither
she
have
precede
him

solemnly

I

<EOS>
so
Jos
and
his
acquaintance
dine
and
drank
their
claret
among
themselves
in
silence
,
whilst
the
sand
of
life
be
run
out
in
the
old
man

glass
upstairs

<EOS>
the
velvet

foot
butler
bring
them
their
wine
,

they
compose
themselves
to
a
rubber
after
dinner
,
at
which
Major
Dobbin
would
sometimes
come
and
take
a
hand
;
and
Mrs.
Osborne
would
occasionally
descend
,
when
her
patient
above
be
settle
for
the
night
,
and
have
commence
one
of
those
lightly
troubled
slumber
which
visit
the
pillow
of
old
age
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
clung
to
his
daughter
during
this
sickness
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
take
his
broth
and
medicine
from
scarcely
any
other
hand
.
 
<EOS>
to
tend
him
become
almost
the
sole
business
of
her
life

<EOS>
Her
bed
be
place
close
by
the
door
which
open
into
his
chamber
,
and
she
be
alive
at
the
slight
noise
or
disturbance
from
the
couch
of
the
querulous
invalid
.
<EOS>
though
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
lie
awake
many
an
hour
,
silent
and
without
stirring
,
unwilling
to
awaken
his
kind
and
vigilant
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
He
love
his
daughter
with
more
fondness
now
,
perhaps
,
than
ever
he
have
do
since
the
day
of
her
childhood

<EOS>
in
the
discharge
of
gentle
office

kind
filial
duty

this
simple
creature
shine
most
especially
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
walk
into
the
room
as
silently
as
a
sunbeam

"
Mr.
Dobbin
think
as
he
see
her
pass
in
and
out
from
her
father
's
room
,
a
cheerful
sweetness
light
up
her
face
as
she
move
to
and
fro
,
graceful
and
noiseless
.
 
<EOS>
when
woman
be
brood
over
their
child

or
busy
in
a
sick

room
,
who
have
not
see
in
their
face
those
sweet
angelic
beam
of
love
and
pity

<EOS>
a
secret
feud
of
some
year

standing
be
thus
heal

with
a
tacit
reconciliation

<EOS>
in
these
last
hour
,
and
touch
by
her
love
and
goodness
,
the
old
man
forget
all
his
grief
against
her
,
and
wrong
which
he
and
his
wife
have
many
a
long
night
debate
:
 
how
she
have
give
up
everything
for
her
boy
;
how
she
be
careless
of
her
parent
in
their
old
age
and
misfortune
,
and
only
think
of
the
child
;
how
absurdly
and
foolishly
,
impiously
indeed
,
she
take
on
when
George
be
remove
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Sedley
forget
these
charge
as
he
be
make
up
his
last
account
,
and
do
justice
to
the
gentle
and
uncomplaine
little
martyr
.
<EOS>
one
night
when
she
steal
into
his
room
,
she
find
him
awake
,
when
the
broken
old
man
make
his
confession
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Emmy
,
I
have
be
think
we
be
very
unkind
and
unjust
to
you
,
"
he
say
and
put
out
his
cold
and
feeble
hand
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
kneel
down
and
pray
by
his
bedside
,
as
he
do
too
,
have
still
hold
of
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
when
our
turn
come
,
friend
,
may
we
have
such
company
in
our
prayer
!
  
<EOS>
perhaps
as
he
be
lie
awake
then
,
his
life
may
have
pass
before
him
 
his
early
hopeful
struggle
,
his
manly
success
and
prosperity
,
his
downfall
in
his
decline
year
,
and
his
present
helpless
condition
 
<EOS>
no
chance
of
revenge
against
Fortune

which
have
have
the
well
of
him
 
<EOS>
neither

bequeath
 
a
spend

out

bootless
life

defeat

disappointment

the
end
here

<EOS>
which
,
I
wonder

brother

be
the
well
lot

to
die
prosperous
and
famous
,
or
poor
and
disappointed

<EOS>
to
have
,
and
to
be
force
to
yield
;
or
to
sink
out
of
life
,
have
play
and
lose
the
game

<EOS>
that
must
be
a
strange
feeling
,
when
a
day
of
our
life
come
and
we
say
,
"
to

success

not

rise

and
all
the
myriad
of
mankind
go
to

work

their
pleasure
as

I
shall
be
out
of
the
turmoil

"
  
<EOS>
so
there
come
one
morning
and
sunrise
when
all
the
world
get
up
and
set
about
its
various
work
and
pleasure
,
with
the
exception
of
old
John
Sedley
,
who
be
not
to
fight
with
fortune
,
or
to
hope
or
scheme
any
more
,
but
to
go
and
take
up
a
quiet
and
utterly
unknown
residence
in
a
churchyard
at
Brompton
by
the
side
of
his
old
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Major
Dobbin
,
Jos
,
and
Georgy
follow
his

to
the
grave
,
in
a
black
cloth
coach

Jos
come
on
purpose
from

whither

retreat
after

deplorable

do
not

in

Emmy
stay
and
do
her
duty
as
usual

<EOS>
She
be
bow
down
by
no
especial
grief
,
and
rather
solemn
than
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
She
pray
that
her
own
end
may
be
as
calm
and
painless
,
and
think
with
trust
and
reverence
of
the
word
which
she
have
hear
from
her
father
during
his
illness
,
indicative
of
his
faith
,
his
resignation
,
and
his
future
hope

<EOS>
yes

I
think
that
will
be
the
well
ending
of
the
two
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
suppose
you
be
particularly
rich

well

say
on
that
last

"
I
be
very

I
do
not

Lazarus

fifty

quite

you
say
,

<EOS>
beyond
these
people
and
Mr.
Clapp
's
family
,
who
come
over
from
Brompton
to
pay
a
visit
of
condolence
,
not
a

soul
alive

care
a
penny
piece
about
old
John
Sedley
,
or
remember
the
existence
of
such
a
person
.
  
<EOS>
when
old
Osborne
first
hear
from
his
friend
Colonel
Buckler
(
as
little
Georgy
have
already
inform
us
)
<EOS>
how
distinguish
an
officer
Major
Dobbin
be
,
he
exhibit
a
great
deal
of
scornful
incredulity
and
express
his
surprise
how
ever
such
a
feller
as
that
should
possess
either
brain
or
reputation

<EOS>
but
he
hear
of
the
Major
's
fame
from
various
member
of

<EOS>
Sir
William
Dobbin
have
a
great
opinion
of
his
son
and
narrate
many
story
illustrative
of
the
Major
's
learning
,
valour
,
and
estimation
in
the
world
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
finally
,
his
name
appear
in
the
list
of
one
or
two
great
party
of
the
nobility
,
and
this
circumstance
have
a
prodigious
effect
upon
the
old
aristocrat
of
Russell
Square
.
  
<EOS>
the
Major
's
position
,
as
guardian
to
Georgy
,
whose
possession
have
be
cede
to
his
grandfather
,
render
some
meeting
between
the
two
gentleman
inevitable
;
and
it
be
in
one
of
these
that
old
Osborne
,
a
keen
man
of
business
,
look
into
the
Major
's
account
with
his
ward
and
the
boy
's
mother
,
get
a
hint
,
which
stagger
him
very
much
,
and
at
once
pain
and
please
him
,
that
it
be
out
of
William
Dobbin
's
own
pocket
that
a
part
of
the
fund
have
be
supply
upon
which
the
poor
widow
and
the
child
have
subsist
.
  
<EOS>
when
press
upon
the
point
,
Dobbin
,
who
could
not
tell
lie
,
blush
and
stammer
a
good
deal
and
finally
confess
.
 
<EOS>
"
the

say
(
at
which
his
interlocutor
's
face
grow
dark

"
be
very
much
my
doing
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
poor
friend
have
go
so
far
that
retreat
from
his
engagement
would
have
be
dishonour
to
him
and
death
to
Mrs.
Osborne
,
and
I
could
do
no
less
,
when
she
be
leave
without
resource

than
give
what
money
I
could
spare
to
maintain
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Major
D.

"
Mr.

give
me
leave

<EOS>
there
be
my

though
I
little
think

my

"
and
the
pair
shake
hand
,
with
great
confusion
on
Major
Dobbin
's
part
,
thus
find
out
in
his
act
of
charitable
hypocrisy
.
  
<EOS>
He
strove
to
soften
the
old
man
and
reconcile
him
towards
his

<EOS>
"
He

such
a

that
all

would
have
do
anything
for

<EOS>
I
,
as
a
young
man
in
those
day
,
be
flatter
beyond
measure
by
his
preference
for
me
,
and
be
more
pleased
to
be
see
in
his
company
than
in
that
of
the
Commander

in

Chief

<EOS>
I
never
see
his
equal
for
pluck
and
daring
and
all
the
quality
of

;
and
Dobbin
tell
the
old
father
as
many
story
as
he
could
remember
regard
the
gallantry
and
achievement
of
his
son

,
and

about
him
accord
to
his

not

glorify
himself
in
recount
his
son
's
feat
and
gallantry
,
but
his
mood
be
at
any

better
and
more
charitable
than

<EOS>
He

He

<EOS>
here
it

<EOS>
the
Major
's
musical
taste
have
be
before
allude
to

and
his
performance
on
the

commend

<EOS>
but
perhaps
the
chief
pleasure
he
have
in
these
opera
be
in
watch
Emmy

rapture
while
listen
to

<EOS>
a

break

this

have
the
keen

fine
sensibility

and
how
could
she
be
indifferent
when
she
hear
Mozart
?
<EOS>
the
tender
part
of
"
Don
Juan
"
awaken
in
her
rapture
so
exquisite
that
she
would
ask
herself
when
she
go
to
say
her
prayer
of
a
night
whether
it
be
not
wicked
to
feel
so
much
delight
as
that
with
which
"
Vedrai
Carino
"
and
"
Batti
Batti
"
fill
her
gentle
little
bosom
?
<EOS>
but
the
Major
,
whom
she
consult
upon
this
head
,
as
her
theological
adviser
(
and
who
himself
have
a
pious
and
reverent
soul
)
,
say
that
for
his
part
,
every
beauty
of
art
or
nature
make
him
thankful
as
well
as
happy
,
and
that
the
pleasure
to
be
have
in
listen
to
fine
music
,
as
in
look
at
the
star
in
the
sky
,
or
at
a
beautiful
landscape
or
picture
,
be
a
benefit
for
which
we
may
thank
Heaven
as
sincerely
as
for
any
other
worldly
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
reply
to
some
faint
objection
of
Mrs.
Amelia
's
(
take
from
certain
theological
work
like
the
Washerwoman
of
Finchley
Common
and
other
of
that
school
,
with
which
Mrs.
Osborne
have
be
furnish
during
her
life

he
tell
her
an
eastern
fable
of
the
Owl
who
think
that
the
sunshine
be
unbearable
for
the
eye

that
the
Nightingale
be
a
most
overrated
bird

<EOS>
"
It
be
one

nature
to
sing
and
the
other

to
hoot
,
"
he
say
,
laugh
,
"
and
with
such
a
sweet
voice
as
you
have
yourself
,
you
must
belong
to
the
Bulbul
faction
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
like
to
dwell
upon
this
period
of
her
life
and
to
think
that
she
be
cheerful
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
she
have
not
have
too
much
of
that
sort
of
existence
as
yet
,
and
have
not
fall
in
the
way
of
mean
to
educate
her
taste
or
her
intelligence

<EOS>
She
have
be
domineer
over
hitherto
by
vulgar
intellect

<EOS>
It
be
the
lot
of
many
a
woman
.
<EOS>
and
as
every
one
of
the
dear
sex
be
the
rival
of
the
rest
of
her
kind
,
timidity
pass
for
folly
in
their
charitable
judgment
;
and
gentleness
for
dulness
;
and
silence
 
which
be
but
<EOS>
timid
denial
of
the
unwelcome
assertion
of
rule
folk
,
and
tacit
protestantism
 
above
all
,
find
no
mercy

the
hand
of
the

Inquisition

<EOS>
thus
,
my

if
you

I
be
to
find
ourselves
this
evening
in
a
society
of
greengrocer
,
let
us
say
,
it
be
probable
that
our
conversation
would
not
be
brilliant
;
if
,
on
the
other

a
greengrocer
should
find
himself
at
your
refined

polite
tea

table
,
where
everybody
be

witty
thing

and
everybody
of
fashion
and
repute
tear
her
friend
to
piece
in
the
most
delightful
manner
,
it
be
possible
that
the
stranger
would
not
be
very
talkative
and
by
no
mean
interesting
or
interested
.
  
<EOS>
and
it
must
be
remember
that
this
poor
lady
have
never
meet
a
gentleman
in
her
life
until
this
present
moment
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
these
be
rare
personage
than
some
of
us
think
for
.
 
<EOS>
which
of
us
can
point
out
many
such
in
his
circle
 
man
whose
aim
be
generous
,
whose
truth
be
constant
,
and
not
only
constant
in
its
kind
but
elevate
in
its
degree
;
whose
want
of
meanness
make
them
simple
;
who
can
look
the
world
honestly
in
the
face
with
an
equal
manly
sympathy
for
the
great
and
the
small
?
<EOS>
We
all
know
a
hundred
whose
coat
be
very
well
make
,
and
a
score
who
have
excellent
manner
,
and
one
or
two
happy
being
who
be
what
they
call
in
the
inner
circle
,
and
have
shoot
into
the
very
centre
and
bull'
-
eye
of
the
fashion
;
but
of
gentleman
how
many
?
<EOS>
let
us
take
a
little
scrap
of
paper
and
each
make
out
his
list
.
  
<EOS>
My
friend
the
Major
<EOS>
I
write
,
without
any
doubt
,
in
mine
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
very
long
leg
,
a
yellow
face
,
and
a
slight
lisp
,
which
at
first
be
rather
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
thought
be
just
,
his
brain
be
fairly
good
,
his
life
be
honest
and
pure
,
and
his
heart
warm
and
humble
.
 
<EOS>
He
certainly
have
very
large
hand
and
foot
,
which
the
two
George
Osbornes
use
to
caricature
and
laugh
at
;
and
their
jeer
and
laughter
perhaps
lead
poor
little
Emmy
astray
as
to
his
worth
.
 
<EOS>
but
have
we
not
all
be
mislead
about
our
hero
and
change
our
opinion
a
hundred
time
?
<EOS>
Emmy
,
in
this
happy
time
,
find
that
her
undergo
a
very
great
change
in
respect
of
the
merit
of
the
Major
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
the
happy
time
of
both
their
life
,
indeed
,
if
they
do
but
know
it
 
and
who
do
?
<EOS>
which
of
us
can
point
out
and
say
that
be
the
culmination
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
summit
of
human
joy
?
<EOS>
but
at
all
event
,
this
couple
be
very
decently
contented
,
and
enjoy
as
pleasant
a
summer
tour
as
any
pair
that
leave
England
that
year
.
<EOS>
Georgy
be
always
present
at
the
play
,
but
it
be
the
Major
who
put
Emmy
's
shawl
on
after
the
entertainment
;
and
in
the
walk
and
excursion
the
young
lad
would
be
on
ahead
,
and
up
a
tower
-
stair
or
a
tree
,
whilst
the
soberer
couple
be
below
,
the
major
smoking
his
cigar
with
great
placidity
and
constancy
,
whilst
Emmy
sketch
the
site
or
the
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
very
tour
that
I
,
the
present
writer
of
a
history
of
which
every
word
be
true
,
have
the
pleasure
to
see
them
first
and
to
make
their
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
at
the
little
comfortable
ducal
town
of
Pumpernickel
(
that
very
place
where
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
have
be
so
distinguished
as
an
attache
;
but
that
be
in
early
early
day
,
and
before
the
news
of
the
Battle
of
Austerlitz
send
all
the
english
diplomatist
in
Germany
to
the
right
about
)
that
I
first
see
Colonel
Dobbin
and
his
party
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
arrive
with
the
carriage
and
courier
at
the
Erbprinz
Hotel
,
the
good
of
the
town
,
and
the
whole
party
dine
at
the
table
d'hote
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
remark
the
majesty
of
Jos
and
the
know
way
in
which
he
sip
,
or
rather
suck
,
the
Johannisberger
,
which
he
order
for
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
boy
,
too
,
we
observe
,
have
a
famous
appetite
,
and
consume
schinken
,
and
braten
,
and
kartoffeln
,
and
cranberry
jam
,
and
salad
,
and
pudding
,
and
roast
fowl
,
and
sweetmeat
,
with
a
gallantry
that
do
honour
to
his
nation
.
 
<EOS>
after
about
fifteen
dish
,
he
conclude
the
repast
with
dessert
,
some
of
which
he
even
carry
out
of
door
,
for
some
young
gentleman
at
table
,
amuse
with
his
coolness
and
gallant
free
-
and
-
easy
manner
,
induce
him
to
pocket
a
handful
of
macaroon
,
which
he
discuss
on
his
way
to
the
theatre
,
whither
everybody
go
in
the
cheery
social
little
german
place
.
<EOS>
the
lady
in
black
,
the
boy
's
mamma
,
laugh
and
blush
,
and
look
exceedingly
pleased
and
shy
as
the
dinner
go
on
,
and
at
the
various
feat
and
instance
of
espieglerie
on
the
part
of
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
the
Colonel
 
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
so
he
become
very
soon
afterwards
 
<EOS>
I
remember
joke
the
boy
with
a
great
deal
of
grave
fun
,
point
out
dish
which
he
have
not
try
,
and
entreat
him
not
to
baulk
his
appetite
,
but
to
have
a
second
supply
of
this
or
that
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
what
they
call
a
gast
-
rolle
night
at
the
Royal
Grand
Ducal
Pumpernickelisch
Hof
 
or
Court
theatre
 
and
Madame
Schroeder
Devrient
,
then
in
the
bloom
of
her
beauty
and
genius
,
perform
the
part
of
the
heroine
in
the
wonderful
opera
of
Fidelio
.
 
<EOS>
from
our
place
in
the
stall
we
could
see
our
four
friend
of
the
table
d'hote
in
the
loge
which
Schwendler
of
the
Erbprinz
keep
for
his
good
guest
,
and
I
could
not
help
remark
the
effect
which
the
magnificent
actress
and
music
produce
upon
Mrs.
Osborne
,
for
so
we
hear
the
stout
gentleman
in
the
mustachio
call
her
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
astonishing
Chorus
of
the
Prisoners
,
over
which
the
delightful
voice
of
the
actress
rise
and
soar
in
the
most
ravish
harmony
,
the
english
lady
's
face
wear
such
an
expression
of
wonder
and
delight
that
it
strike
even
little
Fipps
,
the
blase
attache
,
who
drawl
out
,
as
he
fix
his
glass
upon
her
,
"
gayd
,
it
really
do
one
good
to
see
a
woman
caypable
of
that
stayt
of
excaytement

"
<EOS>
and
in
the
Prison
Scene
,
where
Fidelio

rush
to
her
husband
,
cry
,
"
nicht

nicht

"
she
fairly
lose
herself
and
cover
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
every
woman
in
the
house
be
snivel
at
the
time
,
but
I
suppose
it
be
because
it
be
predestine
that
I
be
to
write
this
particular
lady
's
memoir
that
I
remark
her
.
  
<EOS>

piece
of
Beethoven

Die
Schlacht
bei
Vittoria

<EOS>
Malbrook

at
the
beginning
of
the

<EOS>
then

Jos

motive

difficult
of
comprehension
,
and
Dobbin
laugh
in
his
sleeve
,
like
a
hypocrite
as
he

when
he
find
,
by
the

manner

It

the

insist
upon
have
his

opera
play
there

it
be

one
day

in
a
fury

from
his

when
he
attend
a

break
a

on

who
be
conduct

during
which
time
the
Duchess
Sophia
write
domestic
comedy
,
which
must
have
be
very
dreary
to
witness

<EOS>
but
the
Prince
execute
his
music
in
private
now
,
and
the
Duchess
only
give
away
her
play
to
the
foreigner
of
distinction
who
visit
her
kind
little
court

It

conduct

what

<EOS>
that
there
be
feud
in

no

can
deny
.
<EOS>
politic
run
very
high
at
Pumpernickel

party
be
very
bitter

there
be
the
Strumpff
faction

the
Lederlung
party
,
the

support
by
our

the
other
by
the
french
Charge
d'Affaires
,
M.
de
Macabau

<EOS>
indeed
it
suffice
for
our
Minister
to
stand
up
for
Madame
Strumpff
,
who
be
clearly
the
great
singer
of
the
two
,
and
have
three
more
note
in
her
voice
than
Madame
Lederlung
her
rival
 
<EOS>
it
suffice
,
I
say
,
for
our
Minister
to
advance
any
opinion
to
have
it
instantly
contradict
by
the
french
diplomatist
.
  
<EOS>
everybody
in

be
range
in
one

other
of
these
faction

<EOS>
the
Lederlung
be
a
prettyish
little
creature
certainly
,
and
her
voice
(
what
there
be
of
it
)
be
very
sweet
,
and
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
Strumpff
be
not
in
her
first
youth
and
beauty
,
and
certainly
too
stout
;
when
she
come
on
in
the
last
scene
of
the
Sonnambula
,
for
instance
,
in
her
night
-
chemise
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
,
and
have
to
go
out
of
the
window
,
and
pass
over
the
plank
of
the
mill
,
it
be
all
she
could
do
to
squeeze
out
of
the
window
,
and
the
plank
use
to
bend
and
creak
again
under
her
weight
 
<EOS>
but
how
she
pour
out
the
finale
of
the
opera
!
 
<EOS>
and
with
what
a
burst
of
feeling
she
rush
into
Elvino
's
arm
 
almost
fit
to
smother
him
!
<EOS>
whereas
the
little
Lederlung
 
but
a
truce
to
this
gossip
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
these
two
woman
be
the
two
flag
of
the
French

the
english
party
at
Pumpernickel
,
and
the
society
be

<EOS>
We
have
on
our
side
the
Home
Minister
,
the
Master
of
the
Horse
,
the
Duke
's
Private
Secretary
,
and
the
Prince

Tutor
;
whereas
of
the
french
party
be
the
Foreign

,
the
Commander

in

Chief

Lady
,
who
have
serve
under

and
the

-
Marschall
and
his

who
be
glad
enough
to
get

,
and
always
have
them
and
her

M.

Macabau
's

.
 
<EOS>
the
Secretary
of
his
Chancery
be
little
Grignac
,
a
young
fellow
,
as
malicious
as
Satan
,
and
who
make
caricature
of
Tapeworm
in
all
the

of

<EOS>
Their
headquarters
and
table
d'hote
be
establish
at
the
Pariser
Hof
,
the
other
inn
of
the
town
;
and
though
,
of
course
,
these
gentleman
be
oblige
to
be
civil
in
public
,
yet
they
cut
at
each
other
with
epigram
that
be
as
sharp
as
razor
,
as
I
have
see
a
couple
of
wrestler
in
Devonshire
,
lash
at
each
other
's
shin
and
never
show
their
agony
upon

<EOS>
neither
Tapeworm
nor
Macabau
ever
send
home
a
dispatch
to
his
government
without
a
most
savage
series
of
attack
upon
his
rival
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
on
our
side
we
would
write
,
"
the
interest
of
Great
Britain
in
this
place
,
and
throughout
the
whole
of
Germany
,
be
perille
by
the
continuance
in

of
the
present
french
envoy
;
this
man
be
of
a
character
so
infamous
that
he
will
stick
at
no
falsehood
,
or
hesitate
at
no
crime
,
to
attain
his
end
.
 
<EOS>
He
poison
the
mind
of
the
Court
against
the
english
minister
,
represent
the
conduct
of
Great
Britain
in
the
most
odious
and
atrocious
light
,
and
be
unhappily
back
by
a
minister
whose
ignorance
and
necessity
be
as
notorious
as
his
influence
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
"
on
their
side
they
would
say
,
"
M.
de
Tapeworm
continue
his
system
of
stupid
insular
arrogance
and
vulgar
falsehood
against
the
great
nation
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
yesterday
he
be
hear
to
speak
lightly
of
Her
Royal
Highness
Madame
the
Duchess
of
Berri
;
on
a
former
occasion
he
insult
the
heroic
Duke
of
Angouleme
and
dare
to
insinuate
that
H.R.H.
 
the
Duke
of
Orleans
be
conspire
against
the
august

of
the

<EOS>
His

so
on

<EOS>
when

spicy

<EOS>
before

it

<EOS>
She

Jos

remain
behind

he
be
no

but
not
averse
to
the
little
excitement
of
the

now
and
then

and
he

some
napoleon

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
She

movement

room

just
take
the

<EOS>
"

"

with

<EOS>
a
Vagabond
Chapter
 
<EOS>
We
must
pass
over
a
part
of
Mrs.
Rebecca
Crawley
's
biography
with
that
lightness
and
delicacy
which
the
world
demand
 
the
moral
world
,
that
have
,
perhaps
,
no
particular
objection
to
vice
,
but
an
insuperable
repugnance
to
hear
vice
call
by
its
proper
name
.
<EOS>
there
be
thing
we
do
and
know
perfectly
well
in
Vanity
Fair
,
though
we
never
speak
of
them
:
 
as
the
Ahrimanians
worship
the
devil
,
but
do
not
mention
him
:
and
a
polite
public
will
no
more
bear
to
read
an
authentic
description
of
vice
than
a
truly
refined
english
or
american
female
will
permit
the
word
breeche
to
be
pronounce
in
her
chaste
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
madam
,
both
be
walk
the
world
before
our
face
every
day
,
without
much
shock
us
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
blush
every
time
they
go
by
,
what
complexion
you
would
have
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
their
naughty
name
be
call
out
that
your
modesty
have
any
occasion
to
show
alarm
or
sense
of
outrage
,
and
it
have
be
the
wish
of
the
present
writer
,
all
through
this
story
,
deferentially
to
submit
to
the
fashion
at
present
prevailing
,
and
only
to
hint
at
the
existence
of
wickedness
in
a
light
,
easy
,
and
agreeable
manner
,
so
that
nobody
's
fine
feeling
may
be
offend
.
 
<EOS>
I
defy
any
one
to
say
that
our
Becky
,
who
have
certainly
some
vice
,
have
not
be
present
to
the
public
in
a
perfectly
genteel
and
inoffensive
manner
.
 
<EOS>
in
describe
this
Siren
,
singe
and
smile
,
coax
and
cajole
,
the
author
,
with
modest
pride
,
ask
his
reader
all
round
,
have
he
once
forget
the
law
of
politeness
,
and
show
the
monster
's
hideous
tail
above
water
?
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
those
who
like
may
peep
down
under
wave
that
be
pretty
transparent
and
see
it
writhe
and
twirl
,
diabolically
hideous
and
slimy
,
flap
amongst
bone
,
or
curl
round
corpse
;
but
above
the
waterline
,
I
ask
,
have
not
everything
be
proper
,
agreeable
,
and
decorous
,
and
have
any
the
most
squeamish
immoralist
in
Vanity
Fair
a
right
to
cry
fie
?
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
the
Siren
disappear
and
dive
below
,
down
among
the
dead
man
,
the
water
of
course
grow
turbid
over
her
,
and
it
be
labour
lose
to
look
into
it
ever
so
curiously
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
pretty
enough
when
they
sit
upon
a
rock
,
twang
their
harp
and
comb
their
hair
,
and
sing
,
and
beckon
to
you
to
come
and
hold
the
looking
-
glass
;
but
when
they
sink
into
their
native
element
,
depend
on
it
,
those
mermaid
be
about
no
good
,
and
we
have
best
not
examine
the
fiendish
marine
cannibal
,
revelling
and
feasting
on
their
wretched
pickle
victim
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
when
Becky
be
out
of
the
way
,
be
sure
that
she
be
not
particularly
well
employ
,
and
that
the
less
that
be
say
about
her
doing
be
in
fact
the
well
.
  
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
give
a
full
account
of
her
proceeding
during
a
couple
of
year
that
follow
after
the
Curzon
Street
catastrophe
,
there
may
be
some
reason
for
people
to
say
this
book
be
improper
.
 
<EOS>
the
action
of
very
vain
,
heartless
,
pleasure
-
seek
people
be
very
often
improper
(
as
be
many
of
yours
,
my
friend
with
the
grave
face
and
spotless
reputation
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
merely
by
the
way
)
;
and
what
be
those
of
a
woman
without
faith
 
or
love
 
or
character
?
<EOS>
and
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
there
be
a
period
in
Mrs
Becky
's
life
when
she
be
seize
,
not
by
remorse
,
but
by
a
kind
of
despair
,
and
absolutely
neglect
her
person
and
do
not
even
care
for
her
reputation
.
  
<EOS>
this
abattement
and
degradation
do
not
take
place
all
at
once
;
it
be
bring
about
by
degree
,
after
her
calamity
,
and
after
many
struggle
to
keep
up
 
as
a
man
who
go
overboard
hang
on
to
a
spar
whilst
any
hope
be
leave
,
and
then
fling
it
away
and
go
down
,
when
he
find
that
struggle
be
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
She
linger
about
London
whilst
her
husband
be
make
preparation
for
his
departure
to
his
seat
of
government
,
and
it
be
believe
make
more
than
one
attempt
to
see
her
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
,
and
to
work
upon
his
feeling
,
which
she
have
almost
enlist
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
as
Sir
Pitt
and
Mr.
Wenham
be
walk
down
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
the
latter
spy
Mrs.
Rawdon
in
a
black
veil
,
and
lurk
near
the
palace
of
the
legislature
.
 
<EOS>
She
sneak
away
when
her
eye
meet
those
of
Wenham
,
and
indeed
never
succeed
in
her
design
upon
the
Baronet
.
  
<EOS>
probably
Lady
Jane
interpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
that
she
quite
astonish
her
husband
by
the
spirit
which
she
exhibit
in
this
quarrel
,
and
her
determination
to
disown
Mrs.
Becky
.
 
<EOS>
of
her
own
movement
,
she
invite
Rawdon
to
come
and
stop
in
Gaunt
Street
until
his
departure
for
Coventry
Island
,
know
that
with
him
for
a
guard
Mrs.
Becky
would
not
try
to
force
her
door
;
and
she
look
curiously
at
the
superscription
of
all
the
letter
which
arrive
for
Sir
Pitt
,
lest
he
and
his
sister
-
in
-
law
should
be
correspond
.
 
<EOS>
not
but
that
Rebecca
could
have
write
have
she
a
mind
,
but
she
do
not
try
to
see
or
to
write
to
Pitt
at
his
own
house
,
and
after
one
or
two
attempt
consent
to
his
demand
that
the
correspondence
regard
her
conjugal
difference
should
be
carry
on
by
lawyer
only
.
  
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
Pitt
's
mind
have
be
poison
against
her
.
 
<EOS>
a
short
time
after
Lord
Steyne
's
accident
Wenham
have
be
with
the
Baronet
and
give
him
such
a
biography
of
Mrs.
Becky
as
have
astonish
the
member
for
Queen
's
Crawley
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
everything
regard
her
:
who
her
father
be
;
in
what
year
her
mother
dance
at
the
opera
;
what
have
be
her
previous
history
;
and
what
her
conduct
during
her
married
life
 
as
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
great
part
of
the
story
be
false
and
dictate
by
interested
malevolence
,
it
shall
not
be
repeat
here
.
 
<EOS>
but
Becky
be
leave
with
a
sad
sad
reputation
in
the
esteem
of
a
country
gentleman
and
relative
who
have
be
once
rather
partial
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
revenue
of
the
Governor
of
Coventry
Island
be
not
large
.
 
<EOS>
a
part
of
them
be
set
aside
by
his
Excellency
for
the
payment
of
certain
outstanding
debt
and
liability
,
the
charge
incident
on
his
high
situation
require
considerable
expense
;
finally
,
it
be
find
that
he
could
not
spare
to
his
wife
more
than
three
hundred
pound
a
year
,
which
he
propose
to
pay
to
her
on
an
undertaking
that
she
would
never
trouble
him
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
scandal
,
separation
,
doctor
'
Commons
would
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
Mr.
Wenham
's
business
,
Lord
Steyne
's
business
,
Rawdon
's
,
everybody
be
 
to
get
her
out
of
the
country
,
and
hush
up
a
most
disagreeable
affair
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
probably
so
much
occupy
in
arrange
these
affair
of
business
with
her
husband
's
lawyer
that
she
forget
to
take
any
step
whatever
about
her
son
,
the
little
Rawdon
,
and
do
not
even
once
propose
to
go
and
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
that
young
gentleman
be
consign
to
the
entire
guardianship
of
his
aunt
and
uncle
,
the
former
of
whom
have
always
possess
a
great
share
of
the
child
's
affection
.
 
<EOS>
His
mamma
write
him
a
neat
letter
from
Boulogne
,
when
she
quit
England
,
in
which
she
request
him
to
mind
his
book
,
and
say
she
be
go
to
take
a
Continental
tour
,
during
which
she
would
have
the
pleasure
of
write
to
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
never
do
for
a
year
afterwards
,
and
not
,
indeed
,
until
Sir
Pitt
's
only
boy
,
always
sickly
,
die
of
hooping
-
cough
and
measle
 
<EOS>
then
Rawdon
's
mamma
write
the
most
affectionate
composition
to
her
darle
son
,
who
be
make
heir
of
Queen
's
Crawley
by
this
accident
,
and
draw
more
closely
than
ever
to
the
kind
lady
,
whose
tender
heart
have
already
adopt
him
.
 
<EOS>
Rawdon
Crawley
,
then
grow
a
tall
,
fine
lad
,
blush
when
he
get
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Aunt
Jane
,
you
be
my
mother
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
;
"
and
not
 
and
not
that
one
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
write
back
a
kind
and
respectful
letter
to
Mrs.
Rebecca
,
then
live
at
a
boarding
-
house
at
Florence
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
advance
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Our
darling
Becky
's
first
flight
be
not
very
far
.
 
<EOS>
She
perch
upon
the
french
coast
at
Boulogne
,
that
refuge
of
so
much
exile
english
innocence
,
and
there
live
in
rather
a
genteel
,
widow
manner
,
with
a
femme
de
chambre
and
a
couple
of
room
,
at
an
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
She
dine
at
the
table
d'hote
,
where
people
think
her
very
pleasant
,
and
where
she
entertain
her
neighbour
by
story
of
her
brother
,
Sir
Pitt
,
and
her
great
London
acquaintance
,
talk
that
easy
,
fashionable
slip
-
slop
which
have
so
much
effect
upon
certain
folk
of
small
breeding
.
 
<EOS>
She
pass
with
many
of
them
for
a
person
of
importance
;
she
give
little
tea
-
party
in
her
private
room
and
share
in
the
innocent
amusement
of
the
place
in
sea
-
bathing
,
and
in
jaunt
in
open
carriage
,
in
stroll
on
the
sand
,
and
in
visit
to
the
play
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Burjoice
,
the
printer
's
lady
,
who
be
board
with
her
family
at
the
hotel
for
the
summer

and
to
whom

of
a
Saturday
and
Sunday

vote
her
charming
,
until
that
little
rogue
of
a
Burjoice
begin
to
pay
her
too
much
attention
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
in
the
story
,
only
that
Becky
be
always
affable
,
easy
,
and
good
-
natured
 
and
with
man
especially
.
  
<EOS>
number
of
people
be
go
abroad
as
usual
at
the
end
of
the
season
,
and
Becky
have
plenty
of
opportunity
of
find
out
by
the
behaviour
of
her
acquaintance
of
the
great
London
world
the
opinion
of
"
society
"
as
regard
her
conduct

<EOS>
one
day
it
be
Lady

and
her

confront

modestly
on

perhaps
the

so
intolerable
to

It

Becky

niggardliness
in

Becky

,
that
Becky
,
we

receive
a
notice
to
quit
from
the

,
who
have
be
tell
by
some
one
that
she
be
quite
an
unfit

where
english

would
not

<EOS>
and
she

<EOS>
still

<EOS>
in

she
do
everything

be
respectable

and
that
be
why
we
dwell
upon
this

pleasant

She
see
people
avoid
her

Lord

husband

Mrs.

with
a

not

<EOS>
the
Eagles
then
patronize
Mrs.

take
her
to
live
with

quarrel
with
the

do
all

Becky

virtue

good
repute

<EOS>
Becky

but
the
life

humdrum
virtue
grow
utterly
tedious
to
her
before
long

<EOS>
It
be
the

routine
every
day

<EOS>
the

dulness
and
comfort
,
the

drive
over
the

stupid
Bois

warning

keep
house

a
female

then
the
double
menage
begin

get
into

then
she
determine
upon
a
boarding

house
existence

live
for
some
time
at
that

Becky
love
society

,
indeed

could
no

exist
without
it

an

she
be
happy

at

"
the

the

they

not
bad
than
Jack
this

Tom

<EOS>
the
mistress
of

be
a

I
do
not

so
vulgar

here
she

the

in

you
may
fancy
yourself
for
a

in
good
society

and
that
Madame
be
a
real
Countess

<EOS>
many

do
so
fancy

Becky
be
for
a
while
one
of
the
most
dashing
lady
of
the
Countess
's
salon
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
probable
that
her
old
creditor
of
1815
find
her
out
and
cause
her
to
leave
Paris
,
for
the
poor
little
woman

rather
suddenly

the

treat

in
Devonshire
about
their
felicitous
introduction
to
foreign

<EOS>
here
,
as
at
Paris
,
Becky
be
a
boarding
-
house
queen
,
and
rule
in
select
pension
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
refuse
the
champagne
,
or
the
bouquet
,
or
the
drive
into
the
country
,
or
the
private
box
;
but
what
she
prefer
be
the
ecarte
at
night
,
 
and
she
play
audaciously
.
<EOS>
first
she
play
only
for
a
little
,
then
for
five
-
franc
piece
,
then
for
napoleon
,
then
for
note
:
 
then
she
would
not
be
able
to
pay
her
month
's
pension
:
 
<EOS>
then
she
borrow
from
the
young
gentleman
:
then
she
get
into
cash
again
and
bully
Madame
de
Borodino
,
whom
she
have
coax
and
wheedle
before
:
 
<EOS>
then
she
be
play
for
ten
sous
at
a
time
,
and
in
a
dire
state
of
poverty
:
 
then
her
quarter
's
allowance
would
come
in
,
and
she
would
pay
off
Madame
de
Borodino
's
score
and
would
once
more
take
the
card
against
Monsieur
de
Rossignol
,
or
the
Chevalier
de
Raff
.
  
<EOS>
when
Becky
leave
Brussels
,
the
sad
truth
be
that
she
owe
three
month
'
pension
to
Madame
de
Borodino
,
of
which
fact
,
and
of
the
gambling
,
and
of
the
drinking
,
and
of
the
go
down
on
her
knee
to
the
Reverend
<EOS>
Mr.
Muff
,
Ministre
Anglican
,
and
borrow
money
of
him
,
and
of
her
coax
and
flirt
with
Milor
Noodle
,
son
of
Sir
Noodle
,
pupil
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Muff
,
whom
she
use
to
take
into
her
private
room
,
and
of
whom
she
win
large
sum
at
ecarte
 
of
which
fact
,
I
say
,
and
of
a
hundred
of
her
other
knavery
,
the
Countess
de
Borodino
inform
every
english
person
who
stop
at
her
establishment
,
and
announce
that
Madame
Rawdon
be
no
well
than
a
vipere

<EOS>
so
our
little
wanderer
go
about
set
up
her
tent
in
various
city
of
Europe
,
as
restless
as
Ulysses
or
Bampfylde
Moore
Carew
.
<EOS>
Her
taste
for
disrespectability
grow
more
and
more
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
She
become
a
perfect
Bohemian
ere
long
,
herd
with
people
whom
it
would
make
your
hair
stand
on

to
meet
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
town
of
any
mark
in
Europe
<EOS>
but
it
have
its
little
colony
of
English

whose

Mr.

they
can
swindle
a
Jew

or
find
another
Mr.

<EOS>
the
alternation
of
splendour
and
misery
which
these
people
undergo
be
very
queer
to
view
.
 
<EOS>
Their
life
must
be
one
of
great
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
Becky
 
<EOS>
must
it
be
own

<EOS>
take
to
this
life

and
take
to
it
not
unkindly
.
 
<EOS>
She
go

these
Bohemians

<EOS>
the
lucky
Mrs.

in
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
Madame

Cruchecassee
keep
house
at
Florence
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
she
be
order
out
of
Munich
,
and
my
friend
Mr.
Frederick
Pigeon
aver
that
it
be
at
her
house
at
Lausanne
that
he
be
hocus
at
supper
and
lose
eight
hundred

to
Major
Loder
and
the
honourable
Mr.

.
 
<EOS>
We
be
bind
,
you
see
,
to
give
some
account
of
Becky
's
biography
,
but
of
this
part
,
the
less
,
perhaps
,
that
be
say
the
well
.
  
<EOS>
They
say
that
,
when
Mrs.
Crawley
be
particularly
down
on
her
luck
,
she
give
concert
and
lesson
in
music
here
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
Madame
de
Raudon
,
who
certainly
have
a
matinee
musicale
at
Wildbad
,
accompany
by
Herr
Spoff
,
premier
pianist
to
the
Hospodar
of
Wallachia
,
and
my
little
friend
Mr.
Eaves
,
who
know
everybody
and
have
travel
everywhere
,
always
use
to
declare
that
he
be
at
Strasburg
in
the
year
1830
,
when
a
certain
Madame
Rebecque
make
her
appearance
in
the
opera
of
the
Dame
Blanche
,
give
occasion
to
a
furious
row
in
the
theatre
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
hiss
off
the
stage
by
the
audience
,
partly
from
her
own
incompetency
,
but
chiefly
from
the
ill
-
advise
sympathy
of
some
person
in
the
parquet
,
(
where
the
officer
of
the
garrison
have
their
admission
)
;
and
Eaves
be
certain
that
the
unfortunate
debutante
in
question
be
no
other
than
Mrs.
Rawdon
Crawley
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
,
in
fact
,
no
well
than
a
vagabond
upon
this
earth
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
get
her
money
she
gamble
;
when
she
have
gamble
it
she
be
put
to
shift
to
live
;
who
know
how
or
by
what
mean
she
succeed
?
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
she
be
once
see
at
St.
 
Petersburg
,
but
be
summarily
dismiss
from
that
capital
by
the
police
,
so
that
there
can
not
be
any
possibility
of
truth
in
the
report
that
she
be
a
russian
spy
at
Toplitz
and
Vienna
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
even
be
inform
that
at
Paris
she
discover
a
relation
of
her
own
,
no
less
a
person
than
her
maternal
grandmother
,
who
be
not
by
any
mean
<EOS>
a
Montmorenci
,
but
a
hideous
old
box
-
opener
at
a
theatre
on
the
Boulevards
.
 
<EOS>
the
meeting
between
them
,
of
which
other
person
,
as
it
be
hint
elsewhere
,
seem
to
have
be
acquaint
,
must
have
be
a
very
affecting
interview
.
<EOS>
the
present
historian
can
give
no
certain
detail
regard
the
event
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
at
Rome
once
that

<EOS>
if

let

<EOS>
well
,
she
be
hang

,
and
they
go
through
the
room
together
,
and
drank
a
great
quantity
of
champagne
at

where
the

It

<EOS>
He

He

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
and
she
have

"
I

Lord

<EOS>
She

the
very

and
drop

a
little

timid

imploring
curtsey
.
 
<EOS>
He
stare
aghast
at

<EOS>
Becky

and
she
put
her
hand
to
her

a
passionate

despair

bury

both
be

no

by
the
exhibition

much
grief

,
too
,
be
a
good
deal
frighten

affect
at
see
his
old
flame
in
this
condition
.
<EOS>
and
she
begin
,
forthwith
,
to
tell
her
story
 
<EOS>
a
tale
so
neat
,
simple
,
and
artless
that
it
be
quite
evident
from
hear
her
that
if
ever
there
be
a
white
-
robe
angel
escape
from
heaven
to
be
subject
to
the
infernal
machination
and
villainy
of
fiend

that
spotless
be
 
that
miserable
unsullied
martyr

be
present
on
the
bed
before
Jos
 
on
the
bed
,
sit
on
the
brandy
-
bottle
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
a
very
long
,
amicable
,
and
confidential
talk
there
,
in
the
course
of
which
Jos
Sedley
be
somehow
make
aware
<EOS>
(
but
in
a
manner
that
do
not
in
the
least
scare
or
offend
him
)
that
Becky
's
heart
have
first
learn
to
beat
at
his
enchanting
presence
;
that
George
Osborne
have
certainly
pay
an
unjustifiable
court
to
HER
,
which
may
account
for
Amelia
's
jealousy
and
their
little
rupture
;
but
that
Becky
never
give
the
least
encouragement
to
the
unfortunate
officer
,
and
that
she
have
never
cease
to
think
about
Jos
from
the
very
first
day
she
have
see
him
,
though
,
of
course
,
her
duty
as
a
married
woman
be
paramount
 
<EOS>
duty
which
she
have
always
preserve
,
and
would
,
to
her
die
day
,
or
until
the
proverbially
bad
climate
in
which
Colonel
Crawley
be
live
should
release
her
from
a
yoke
which
his
cruelty
have
render
odious
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Jos
go
away
,
convince
that
she
be
the
most
virtuous
,
as
she
be
one
of
the
most
fascinating
of
woman
,
and
revolve
in
his
mind
all
sort
of
benevolent
scheme
for
her
welfare
.
 
<EOS>
Her
persecution
ought
to
be
end
:
she
ought
to
return
to
the
society
of
which
she
be
an
ornament
.
<EOS>
He
would
see
what
ought
to
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
quit
that
place
and
take
a
quiet
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
Amelia
must
come
and
see
her
and
befriend
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
go
and
settle
about
it
,
and
consult
with
the
Major
.
 
<EOS>
She
weep
tear
of
heart
-
feel
gratitude
as
she
part
from
him
,
and
press
his
hand
as
the
gallant
stout
gentleman
stoop
down
to
kiss
hers
.
  
<EOS>
so
Becky
bow
Jos
out
of
her
little
garret
with
as
much
grace
as
if
it
be
a
palace
of
which
she
do
the
honour
;
and
that
heavy
gentleman
have
disappear
down
the
stair
,
Max
and
Fritz
come
out
of
their
hole
,
pipe
in
mouth
,
and
she
amuse
herself
by
mimic
Jos
to
them
as
she
munch
her
cold
bread
and
sausage
and
take
draught
of
her
favourite
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
  
<EOS>
Jos
walk
over
to
Dobbin
's
lodging
with
great
solemnity
and
there
impart
to
him
the
affect
history
with
which
he
have
just
be
make
acquaint
,
without
,
however
,
mention
the
play
business
of
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
and
the
two
gentleman
be
lay
their
head
together
and
consult
as
to
the
good
mean
of
be
useful
to
Mrs.
Becky
,
while
she
be
finish
her
interrupted
dejeuner
a
la
fourchette
.
  
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
she
have
come
to
that
little
town
?
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
she
have
no
friend
and
be
wander
about
alone
?
<EOS>
little
boy
at
school
be
teach
in
their
early
latin
book
that
the
path
of
Avernus
be
very
easy
of
descent
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
skip
over
the
interval
in
the
history
of
her
downward
progress
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
bad
now
than
she
have
be
in
the
day
of
her
prosperity
 
only
a
little
down
on
her
luck
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Mrs.
Amelia
,
she
be
a
woman
of
such
a
soft
and
foolish
disposition
that
when
she
hear
of
anybody
unhappy
,
her
heart
straightway
melt
towards
the
sufferer
;
and
as
she
have
never
think
or
do
anything
mortally
guilty
herself
,
she
have
not
that
abhorrence
for
wickedness
which
distinguish
moralist
much
more
knowing
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
spoil
everybody
who
come
near
her
with
kindness
and
compliment
 
if
she
beg
pardon
of
all
her
servant
for
trouble
them
to
answer
the
bell
 
if
she
apologize
to
a
shopboy
who
show
her
a
piece
of
silk
,
or
make
a
curtsey
to
a
street
-
sweeper
with
a
complimentary
remark
upon
the
elegant
state
of
his
crossing
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
almost
capable
of
every
one
of
these
folly
 
<EOS>
the
notion
that
an
old
acquaintance
be
miserable
be
sure
to
soften
her
heart
;
nor
would
she
hear
of
anybody
's
be
deservedly
unhappy
.
<EOS>
a
world
under
such
legislation
as
her
would
not
be
a
very
orderly
place
of
abode
;
but
there
be
not
many
woman
,
at
least
not
of
the
ruler
,
who
be
of
her
sort
.
 
<EOS>
this
lady
,
I
believe
,
would
have
abolish
all
gaol
,
punishment
,
handcuff
,
whipping
,
poverty
,
sickness
,
hunger
,
in
the
world
,
and
be
such
a
mean
-
spirited
creature
that
 
we
be
oblige
to
confess
it
 
<EOS>
she
could
even
forget
a
mortal
injury
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
Major
hear
from
Jos
of
the
sentimental
adventure
which
have
just
befall
the
latter
,
he
be
not
,
it
must
be
own
,
nearly
as
much
interested
as
the
gentleman
from
Bengal
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
his
excitement
be
quite
the
reverse
from
a
pleasurable
one
;
he
make
use
of
a
brief
but
improper
expression
regard
a
poor
woman
in
distress
,
say
,
in
fact
,
"
the
little
minx
,
have
she
come
to
light
again
?
"
<EOS>
He
never
have
have
the
slight
liking
for
her
,
but
have
heartily
mistrust
her
from
the
very
first
moment
when
her
green
eye
have
look
at
,
and
turn
away
from
,
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
little
devil
bring
mischief
wherever
she
go
,
"
the
Major
say
disrespectfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
know
what
sort
of
life
she
have
be
lead
?
<EOS>
and
what
business
have
she
here
abroad

alone
?
<EOS>
do
not
tell
me
about
persecutor
and
enemy
;
an
honest
woman
always
have
friend
and
never
be
separate
from
her
family
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
she
leave
her
husband
?
<EOS>
He
may
have
be
disreputable
and
wicked
,
as
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
confound
blackleg
and
the
way
in
which
he
use
to
cheat
and
hoodwink
poor
George

<EOS>
be
not
there
a
scandal
about
their
separation

I
hear
something

cry
out
Major
Dobbin
,
who
do
not
care
much
about
gossip
,
and
whom
Jos
try
in
vain
to
convince
that
Mrs.
Becky
be
in
all
respect
a
most
injured
and
virtuous
female
.
  
<EOS>
"
well

well

let
's
ask
Mrs.

say
that
arch

diplomatist
of
a
Major

<EOS>
"
only

go

Hm

I

at
once
,
let
us
go
and
ask
her
if
this
woman
ought

I
will
be

now
this

Emmy

be
at

so
the

contentedly
warble
at

Jos

She
return

It
be
by
that

one
of

first
point

It
jar
upon

to
be
oblige
to
commence
instantly
to
tell
lie

that

the
misfortune

<EOS>
when
one
fib
become
due

it
be

you
must
forge
another

take
up

so
the
stock

inevitably
multiply

detection
increase
every

(

I

inculcate

womankind
in
early
youth
,
namely
,
to
be
thankful
because
we
be
well
off

be

rational

and
then
she
begin
to
think
,
<EOS>
as
usual
,
how
her

be
the
handsome

the
good

the
clever
boy
in

could
think
of
to
console
Becky

<EOS>
if
anything
could
make
her
comfortable
that
would

<EOS>
and
so
the
two
woman
continue
talk
for
an
hour
or
more
,
during
which
Becky
have
the
opportunity
of
give
her
new
friend
a
full
and
complete
version
of
her
private
history

<EOS>
She
show
how
her
marriage
with
Rawdon
Crawley
have
always
be
view
by
the
family
with
feeling
of
the
utmost
hostility
;
how
her
sister

in

law
(
an
artful

have
poison
her

's
mind
against
her

how
he
have
form
odious

which
have
estrange
his

how
she
have
bear
everything
 
poverty

neglect
,
<EOS>
coldness
from
the
being
whom
she
most
love
 
and
all
for
the
sake

;
how
,
finally
,
and
by
the
most
flagrant
outrage
,
she
have
be
drive
into
demand
a
separation
from
her
husband
,
when
the
wretch
do
not
scruple
to
ask
that
she
should
sacrifice
her
own
fair
fame
so
that
he
may
procure
advancement
through
the
mean
of
a
very
great
and
powerful
but
unprincipled
man
 
the
Marquis
of
Steyne

indeed

<EOS>
the
atrocious
monster

<EOS>
this
part

this
insult

the
coward
have

his

and
thus
Becky
say
she
be
a
wanderer

poor

unprotected
,
friendless

wretched

<EOS>
Emmy
receive
this

length

as

<EOS>
She
quiver
with
indignation
at
the
account
of
the
conduct
of
the
miserable
Rawdon

the
unprincipled
Steyne

<EOS>
Her
eye
make
note
of
admiration

every
one
of
the
sentence
in

Becky
describe
the
persecution
of
her
aristocratic
relative

the
fall
away
of

<EOS>
(
Becky
do
not
abuse
him

<EOS>
She
speak
rather

She
have
love
him
only
too
fondly
:
and
be
he
not
the
father

<EOS>
and
William
be
pleased
to
think
,
and
have
more
than
once
soothe
poor
George
's
widow
with
the
narrative
,
that
Osborne

after
quit
his
wife
,
and
after
the
action
of
Quatre
Bras
,
on
the
first
day

gravely
and
affectionately
to
his
comrade
of
his

<EOS>
on
these
fact
,
too
,
William
have
insist
very
strongly
in
his
conversation
with

have
thus
be
the
mean
of

just
at

close
of

<EOS>
and
he
be
pursue
these
foreboding
and
this
uncomfortable
train
of
thought
,
with
his
head
between
his
hand
,
and
the
Pumpernickel
Gazette
of
last
week
unread
under
his
nose
,
when
somebody
tap
his
shoulder
with
a
parasol
,
and
he
look
up
and
see
Mrs.
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
this
woman
have
a
way
of
tyrannize
over
Major
Dobbin
(
for
the
weak
of
all
people
will
domineer
over
somebody
)
,
and
she
order
him
about
,
and
pat
him
,
and
make
him
fetch
and
carry
just
as
if
he
be
a
great
Newfoundland
dog
.
 
<EOS>
He
like
,
so
to
speak
,
to
jump
into
the
water
if
she
say
"
high
,
Dobbin

"
and
to
trot
behind
her
with
her
reticule
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
this
history
have
be
write
to
very
little
purpose
if
the
reader
have
not
perceive
that
the
Major
be
a
spooney

<EOS>
"
why
do
you
not
wait
for
me
,
sir
,
to
escort
me
downstairs
?

"
she
say
,
give
a
little
toss
of
her
head
and
a
most
sarcastic
curtsey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
stand
up
in
the
passage
,
"
he
answer
with
a
comical
deprecatory
look
;
and
,
delight
to
give
her
his
arm
and
to
take
her
out
of
the
horrid
smoky
place
,
he
would
have
walk
off
without
even
so
much
as
remember
the
waiter
,
have
not
the
young
fellow
run
after
him
and
stop
him
on
the
threshold
of
the
Elephant
to
make
him
pay
for
the
beer

he
have
not

naughty
man

<EOS>
William

though
he
see
by
Amelia

look
that
a
great
crisis
have
come
,
nevertheless
continue
to
implore
Sedley
,
in
the
most
energetic
term
,
to
beware
of
Rebecca
;
and
he
eagerly
,
almost
frantically
,
adjure
Jos
not
to
receive
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
beseech
Mr.
Sedley
to
inquire
at
least
regard
her
;
tell
him
how
he
have
hear
that
she
be
in
the
company
of
gambler
and
people
of
ill
repute
;
point
out
what
evil
she
have
do
in
former
day
,
how
she
and
Crawley
have
mislead
poor
George
into
ruin
,
how
she
be
now
part
from
her
husband
,
by
her
own
confession
,
and
,
perhaps
,
for
good
reason
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
dangerous
companion
she
would
be
for
his
sister
,
who
know
nothing
of
the
affair
of
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
William
implore
Jos
,
with
all
the
eloquence
which
he
could
bring
to
bear
,
and
a
great
deal
more
energy
than
this
quiet
gentleman
be
ordinarily
in
the
habit
of
showing
,
to
keep
Rebecca
out
of
his
household
.
  
<EOS>
have
he
be
less
violent
,
or
more
dexterous
,
he
may
have
succeed
in
his
supplication
to
Jos
;
but
the
civilian
be
not
a
little
jealous
of
the
air
of
superiority
which
the
Major
constantly
exhibit
towards
him
,
as
he
fancy
(
indeed
,
he
have
impart
his
opinion
to
Mr.
Kirsch
,
the
courier
,
whose
bill
Major
Dobbin
check
on
this
journey
,
and
who
side
with
his
master
)
,
and
he
begin
a
blustering
speech
about
his
competency
to
defend
his
own
honour
,
his
desire
not
to
have
his
affair
meddle
with
,
his
intention
,
in
fine
,
to
rebel
against
the
Major
,
when
the
colloquy
 
rather
a
long
and
stormy
one
 
be
put
an
end
to
in
the
simple
way
possible
,
namely
,
by
the
arrival
of
Mrs.
Becky
,
with
a
porter
from
the
Elephant
Hotel
in
charge
of
her
very
meagre
baggage
.
  
<EOS>
She
greet
her
host
with
affectionate
respect
and
make
a
shrinking
,
but
amicable
salutation
to
Major
Dobbin
,
who
,
as
her
instinct
assure
her
at
once
,
be
her
enemy
,
and
have
be
speak
against
her
;
and
the
bustle
and
clatter
consequent
upon
her
arrival
bring
Amelia
out
of
her
room
.
 
<EOS>
Emmy
go
up
and
embrace
her
guest
with
the
great
warmth
,
and
take
no
notice
of
the
Major
,
except
to
fle
him
an
angry
look
 
<EOS>
the
most
unjust
and
scornful
glance
that
have
perhaps
ever
appear
in
that
poor
little
woman
's
face
since
she
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
private
reason
of
her
own
,
and
be
bent
upon
be
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
and
Dobbin
,
indignant
at
the
injustice
,
not
at
the
defeat
,
go
off
,
make
her
a
bow
quite
as
haughty
as
the
killing
curtsey
with
which
the
little
woman
choose
to
bid
him
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
go
,
Emmy
be
particularly
lively
and
affectionate
to
Rebecca
,
and
bustle
about
the
apartment
and
instal
her
guest
in
her
room
with
an
eagerness
and
activity
seldom
exhibit
by
our
placid
little
friend
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
an
act
of
injustice
be
to
be
do
,
especially
by
weak
people
,
it
be
good
that
it
should
be
do
quickly
,
and
Emmy
think
she
be
display
a
great
deal
of
firmness
and
proper
feeling
and
veneration
for
the
late
Captain
Osborne
in
her
present
behaviour

Secretary
of
Legation

Tapeworm
,
who
invite
him
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
be

that
meal

occasion
to
ask
the
Secretary
whether
he

anything
about
a
certain
Mrs.
Rawdon
Crawley
,
who
have
,
he
believe
,
make
some
noise
in
London

and
then
Tapeworm

who
of
course
know
all
the
London
gossip
,
and
be
besides
a
relative
of
Lady
Gaunt
,
pour
out
into
the
astonished
Major
's
ear
such
a
history
about
Becky
and
her
husband
as
astonish
the
querist
,
and
supply
all
the
point
of
this
narrative
,
for
it
be
at
that
very
table
year
ago
that
the
present
writer
have
the
pleasure
of
hear
the
tale
.
 
<EOS>
Tufto
,
Steyne
,
the
Crawleys
,
and
their
history
 
everything
connect
with
Becky
and
her
previous
life
pass
under
the
record
of
the
bitter
diplomatist
.
<EOS>
He
know
everything
and
a
great
deal
besides
,
about
all
the
world
 
in
a
word
,
he
make
the
most
astounding
revelation
to
the
simple
-
hearted
Major
.
 
<EOS>
when
Dobbin
say
that
Mrs.
Osborne
and
Mr.
Sedley
have
take
her
into
their
house
,
Tapeworm
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
which
shock
the
Major
,
and
ask
if
they
have
not
better
send
into
the
prison
and
take
in
one
or
two
of
the
gentleman
in
shave
head

yellow

of
Pumpernickel
,
chain
in

and
act

to
that
little
scapegrace
Georgy

<EOS>
this
information
astonish
and
horrify
the
Major
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
agree
in
the
morning
(
before
meet
with
Rebecca
)
that
Amelia
should
go
to
the
Court
ball
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
be
the
place
where
he
should
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
Major
go
home
,
and
dress
himself
in
his
uniform
,
and
repair
to
Court
,
in
hope
to
see
Mrs.
Osborne
.
 
<EOS>
She

<EOS>
when

Sedley
tenement

put
out

<EOS>
He
could
not
see
her
till
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
sort
of
a
night
's
rest
he
have
with
this
frightful
secret
in
bed
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
early
convenient
hour
in
the
morning
he
send
his
servant
across
the
way
with
a
note
,
say
that
he
wish
very
particularly
to

<EOS>
a
message

that
Mrs.

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
She
have
be
think
of
a
thing
which
have
agitate
her
mind
a
hundred
time
before

<EOS>
a
hundred
time
on
the
point
of
yield
,
she
have
shrink
back
from
a
sacrifice
which
she
feel
be
too
much
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
in
spite
of
his
love
and
constancy
and
her
own
acknowledged
regard
,
respect
,
and
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
benefit
,
what
be
constancy
,
or
merit
?
<EOS>
one
curl
of
a
girl
's
ringlet
,
one
hair
of
a
whisker
,
will
turn
the
scale
against
them
all
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
weigh
with
Emmy
more
than
with
other
woman

<EOS>
She
have
try
them
;
want
to
make
them
pass
;
could
not

and
the
pitiless
little
woman
have
find
a
pretext
,
and
determine
to
be
free
.
  
<EOS>
when
at
length
,
in
the
afternoon

the

instead
of
the
cordial
and
affectionate
greeting
,
to
which
he
have
be
accustom
now
for
many
a
long
day
,
he

of
a

Rebecca

cling

cherish

it

mine

no

she
would
break
off

no

how
he

befriend
them
all
through
their
poverty

misfortune
;
watch
over

when
nobody
care
for
them
;
how
all
his

him
though
he
never

how
Georgy

father
trust
him
beyond
all

and
have
be
constantly

"
  
<EOS>
in
such
colloquy
the
mother
and
the
child
pass
a
great
deal
of
their
time
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
artless
woman
have
make
a
confidant
of
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
much
William
's
friend
as
everybody
else
who
know
him
well
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
way
,
Mrs.
Becky
,
not
to
be
behind
hand
in
sentiment
,
have
get
a
miniature
too
hang
up
in
her
room
,
to
the
surprise
and
amusement
of
most
people
,
and
the
delight
of
the
original
,
who
be
no
other
than
our
friend
Jos
.
 
<EOS>
on
her
first
come
to
favour
the
Sedleys
with
a
visit
,
the
little
woman
,
who
have
arrive
with
a
remarkably
small
shabby
kit
,
be
perhaps
ashamed
of
the
meanness
of
her
trunk
and
bandbox
,
and
often
speak
with
great
respect
about
her
baggage
leave
behind
at
Leipzig
,
which
she
must
have
from
that
city
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
traveller
talk
to
you
perpetually
about
the
splendour
of
his
luggage
,
which
he
do
not
happen
to
have
with

,
my
son

beware
of
that
traveller
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
ten
to
one
,
an
impostor
.
  
<EOS>
neither
Jos
nor
Emmy
know
this
important
maxim
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
them
of
no
consequence
whether
Becky
have
a
quantity
of
very
fine
clothe
in
invisible
trunk
;
but
as
her
present
supply
be
exceedingly
shabby
,
Emmy
supply
her
out
of
her
own
store
,
or
take
her
to
the
good
milliner
in
the
town
and
there
fit
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no

now
<EOS>

I

<EOS>
the

pot
be
suspend
 
another
excitement
to
which
she
have
accustom
herself
be
also
put
aside
,
or
at
least
only
indulge
in
in
privacy
,
as
when
she
be
prevail
on
by
Jos
of
a
summer
evening
,
Emmy
and
the
boy
be
absent
on
their
walk
,
to
take
a
little
spirit
-
and

water
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
she
do
not
indulge
 
the
courier
do
:
that
rascal
Kirsch
could
not
be
keep
from
the
bottle
,
nor
could
he
tell
how
much
he
take
when
he
apply
to
it

<EOS>
He
be
sometimes
surprised
himself
at
the
way
in
which
Mr.
Sedley

Cognac

<EOS>
well
,
well
,
this
be
a
painful
subject

<EOS>
Becky
do
not
very
likely
indulge
so
much
as
she
use
before
she
enter

decorous
family

<EOS>
at
last
the

of

so
many
year
ago
.
<EOS>
Emmy
also
come
off
with
her
lare
 
<EOS>
her
two
picture
 
and
the
party
,
finally
,
be
,
lodge
in
an
exceedingly
dear
and
uncomfortable
house
at
Ostend
.
  
<EOS>
there
Amelia
begin
to
take
bath
and
get
what
good
she
could
from
them
,
and
though
score
of
people
of
Becky
's
acquaintance
pass
her
and
cut
her
,
yet
Mrs.
Osborne
,
who
walk
about
with
her
,
and
who
know
nobody
,
be
not
aware
of
the
treatment
experience
by
the
friend
whom
she
have
choose
so
judiciously
as
a
companion
;
indeed
,
Becky
never
think
fit
to
tell
her
what
be
pass
under
her
innocent
eye
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
Mrs.
Rawdon
Crawley
's
acquaintance
,
however
,
acknowledge
her
readily
enough
,
 
perhaps
more
readily
than
she
would
have
desire
.
<EOS>
among
those
be
Major
Loder
(
unattached
)
,
and
Captain
Rook
(
late
of
the
Rifles
)
,
who
may
be
see
any
day
on
the
Dike
,
smoking
and
stare
at
the
woman
,
and
who
speedily
get
an
introduction
to
the
hospitable
board
and
select
circle
of
Mr.
Joseph
Sedley
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
they
would
take
no
denial
;
they
burst
into
the
house
whether
Becky
be
at
home
or
not
,
walk
into
Mrs.
Osborne
's
drawing
-
room
,
which
they
perfume
with
their
coat
and
mustachio
,
call
Jos
"
old
buck
,
"
and
invade
his
dinner
-
table
,
and
laugh
and
drank
for
long
hour
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
they
mean
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Georgy
,
who
do
not
like
these
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
the
Major
say
to
Mrs.
Crawley
yesterday
,
"
no
,
no
,
Becky
,
you
shall
not
keep
the
old
buck
to
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
the
bone
in
,
or
,
dammy
,
I
will
split
.
<EOS>
"
what
could
the
major
mean
,
Mamma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Major
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
call
him
major
!
"
<EOS>
Emmy
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
can
not
tell
what
he
mean
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
presence
and
that
of
his
friend
inspire
the
little
lady
with
intolerable
terror
and
aversion
.
 
<EOS>
They
pay
her
tipsy
compliment
;
they
leer
at
her
over
the
dinner
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
Captain
make
her
advance
that
fill
her
with
sickening
dismay
,
nor
<EOS>
would
she
ever
see
him
unless
she
have
George
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
Rebecca
,
to
do
her
justice
,
never
would
let
either
of
these
man
remain
alone
with
Amelia
;
the
Major
be
disengage
too
,
and
swear
he
would
be
the
winner
of
her
.
<EOS>
a
couple
of
ruffian
be
fight
for
this
innocent
creature
,
gambling
for
her
at
her
own
table
,
and
though
she
be
not
aware
of
the
rascal
'
design
upon
her
,
yet
she
feel
a
horror
and
uneasiness
in
their
presence
and
long
to
fly
.
  
<EOS>
She
beseech
,
she
entreat
Jos
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
not
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
slow
of
movement
,
tie
to
his
Doctor
,
and
perhaps
to
some
other
lead
-
string
.
<EOS>
at
least
Becky
be
not
anxious
to
go
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
she
take
a
great
resolution
 
make
the
great
plunge
.
 
<EOS>
She
write
off
a
letter
to
a
friend
whom
she
have
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
,
a
letter
about
which
she
do
not
speak
a
word
to
anybody
,
which
she
carry
herself
to
the
post
under
her
shawl
;
nor
be
any
remark
make
about
it
,
only
that
she
look
very
much
flush
and
agitate
when
Georgy
meet
her
,
and
she
kiss
him
,
and
hang
over
him
a
great
deal
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
come
out
of
her
room
after
her
return
from
her
walk
.
<EOS>
Becky
think
it
be
Major
Loder
and
the
captain
who
frighten
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
not
stop
here
,
"
Becky
reason
with
herself
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
go
away
,
the
silly
little
fool
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
still
whimper
after
that
gaby
of
a
husband
 
dead
(
and
serve
right
!
)
<EOS>
these
fifteen
year
.
<EOS>
She
shall
not
marry
either
of
these
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
bad
of
Loder
.
 
<EOS>
no
;
she
shall
marry
the
bamboo
cane
<EOS>
,
I
will
settle
it
this
very
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Becky
take
a
cup
of
tea
to
Amelia
in
her
private
apartment
and
find
that
lady
in
the
company
of
her
miniature
,
and
in
a
most
melancholy
and
nervous
condition
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
down
the
cup
of
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
"
listen
to
me
,
Amelia
,
"
say
Becky
,
march
up
and
down
the
room
before
the
other
and
survey
her
with
a
sort
of
contemptuous
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
away
from
here
and
from
the
impertinence
of
these
man

<EOS>
I
will
not
have
you
harass
by
them

and
they
will
insult
you
if
you
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
they
be
rascal
:
man
fit
to
send
to
the
hulk
.
 
<EOS>
never
mind
how
I
know
them

<EOS>
I
know
everybody
.
 
<EOS>
Jos
can
not
protect
you
;
he
be
too
weak
and
want
a
protector
himself
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
no
more
fit
to
live
in
the
world
than
a
baby
in
arm
.
<EOS>
You
must
marry
,
or
you
and
your
precious
boy
will
go
to
ruin

<EOS>
You
must
have
a

you
fool

and
one
of
the
good

I
ever
see
have

ungrateful

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
try
 
<EOS>
I
try
my
good
,
indeed
I
do
,
Rebecca
,
"
say
Amelia
deprecatingly
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
forget
 
"
;
and
she
finish
the
sentence
by
look
up
at
the
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
not
forget
him
!
"
<EOS>
cry
out
Becky
,
"
that
selfish
humbug
,
that
low

breed
cockney
dandy

that
pad
booby

who
have
neither

nor

nor
heart

and
be
no
more
to

compare
to
your
friend

Queen
Elizabeth

<EOS>
why

the
man
be
weary
of
you

and
would
have
jilt
you

but
that
Dobbin

He

He

He
use
to
sneer
about

time
after

and
make
love
to
me
the
week
after
he

"
It

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Rebecca
,
"
cry
out
Amelia
,
start
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
there
,
you
fool
,
"
Becky
say
,
still
with
provoke
good
humour
,
and
take
a
little
paper
out
of
her
belt
,
she
open
it
and
fling
it
into
Emmy
's
lap
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
his
handwriting

<EOS>
He
write

give

me
under

the
day
before

shoot
 
and
serve
him
right
!
"
<EOS>
Becky
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
Emmy
do
not
hear
her
;
she
be
look
at
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
which
George
have
put
into
the
bouquet
and
give
to
Becky
on
the
night
of
the
Duchess
of
Richmond
's
ball
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
she
say
:
 
the
foolish
young
man
have
ask
her
to
fly
.
  
<EOS>
Emmy
's
head
sink
down
,
and
for
almost
the
last
time
in
which
she
shall
be
call
upon
to
weep
in
this
history
,
she
commence
that
work
.
 
<EOS>
Her
head
fall
to
her
bosom
,
and
her
hand
go
up
to
her
eye
;
and
there
for
a
while
,
she
give
way
to
her
emotion
,
as
Becky
stand
on
and
regard
her
.
 
<EOS>
who
shall
analyse
those
tear
and
say
whether
they
be
sweet
or
bitter
?
<EOS>
be
she
most
grieve
because
the
idol
of
her
life
be
tumble
down
and
shiver
at
her
foot
,
or
indignant
that
her
love
have
be
so
despised
,
or
glad
because
the
barrier
be
remove
which
modesty
have
place
between
her
and
a
new
,
a
real
affection
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
to
forbid
me
now
,
"
she
think
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
love
him
with
all
my
heart
now
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
will
,
I
will
,
if
he
will
but
let
me
and
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
be
this
feeling
rush
over
all
the
other
which
agitate
that
gentle
little
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
do
not
cry
so
much
as
Becky
expect
 
the
other
soothe
and
kiss
her
 
a
rare
mark
of
sympathy
with
Mrs.
Becky
.
 
<EOS>
She
treat
Emmy
like
a
child
and
pat
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
let
us
get
pen
and
ink
and
write
to
him
to
come
this
minute
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
 
I
write
to
him
this
morning
,
"
Emmy
say
,
blush
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
Becky
scream
with
laughter
 
<EOS>
"
Un
biglietto
,
"
she
sing
out
with
Rosina
,
"
eccolo
qua
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
whole
house
echo
with
her
shrill
singe
.
  
<EOS>
two
morning
after
this
little
scene
,
although
the
day
be
rainy
and
gusty
,
and
Amelia
have
have
an
exceedingly
wakeful
night
,
listen
to
the
wind
roaring
,
and
pity
all
traveller
by
land
and
by
water
,
yet
she
get
up
early
and
insist
upon
take
a
walk
on
the
Dike
with
Georgy
;
and
there
she
pace
as
the
rain
beat
into
her
face
,
and
she
look
out
westward
across
the
dark
sea
line
and
over
the
swollen
billow
which
come
tumble
and
froth
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
neither
speak
much
,
except
now
and
then
,
when
the
boy
say
a
few
word
to
his
timid
companion
,
indicative
of
sympathy
and
protection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
not
cross
in
such
weather
,
"
Emmy
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
bet
ten
to
one
he
do
,
"
the
boy
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
,
Mother
,
there
be
the
smoke
of
the
steamer
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
that
signal
,
sure
enough
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
the
steamer
be
under
way
,
he
may
not
be
on
board
;
he
may
not
have
get
the
letter
;
he
may
not
choose
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
a
hundred
fear
pour
one
over
the
other
into
the
little
heart
,
as
fast
as
the
wave
on
to
the
Dike
.
  
<EOS>
the
boat
follow
the
smoke
into
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Georgy
have
a
dandy
telescope
and
get
the
vessel
under
view
in
the
most
skilful
manner
.
<EOS>
and
he
make
appropriate
nautical
comment
upon
the
manner
of
the
approach
of
the
steamer
as
she
come
nearer
and
nearer
,
dip
and
rise
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
the
signal
of
an
english
steamer
in
sight
go
flutter
up
to
the
mast
on
the
pier
.
 
<EOS>
I
daresay
Mrs.
Amelia
's
heart
be
in
a
similar
flutter
.
  
<EOS>
Emmy
try
to
look
through
the
telescope
over
George
's
shoulder
,
but
she
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
only
see
a
black
eclipse
bob
up
and
down
before
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
George
take
the
glass
again
and
rake
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
"
how
she
do
pitch
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
go
a
wave
slap
over
her
bow
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
two
people
on
deck
besides
the
steersman
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
man
lie
down
,
and
a
 
chap
in
a
 
cloak
with
a
 
Hooray
!
 
<EOS>
it
be
dob
,
by
Jingo
!
"
<EOS>
He
clap
to
the
telescope
and
fling
his
arm
round
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
that
lady
,
let
us
say
what
she
do
in
the
word
of
a
favourite
poet
 
"
Dakruoen
gelasasa
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
sure
it
be
William
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
be
no
other
.
 
<EOS>
what
she
have
say
about
hope
that
he
would
not
come
be
all
hypocrisy
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
would
come
;
what
could
he
do
else
but
come
?
<EOS>
She
know
he
would
come
.
  
<EOS>
the
ship
come
swiftly
near
and
near
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
go
in
to
meet
her
at
the
landing
-
place
at
the
quay
,
Emmy
's
knee
tremble
so
that
she
scarcely
could
run
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
like
to
kneel
down
and
say
her
prayer
of
thank
there
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
she
think
,
she
would
be
all
her
life
say
them
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
bad
day
that
as
the
vessel
come
alongside
of
the
quay
there
be
no
idler
abroad
,
scarcely
even
a
commissioner
on
the
look
out
for
the
few
passenger
in
the
steamer
.
 
<EOS>
that
young
scapegrace
George
have
flee
too
,
and
as
the
gentleman
in
the
old
cloak
line
with
red
stuff
step
on
to
the
shore
,
there
be
scarcely
any
one
present
to
see
what
take
place
,
which
be
briefly
this
:
  
<EOS>
a
lady
in
a
dripping
white
bonnet
and
shawl
,
with
her
two
little
hand
out
before
her
,
go
up
to
him
,
and
in
the
next
minute
she
have
altogether
disappear
under
the
fold
of
the
old
cloak
,
and
be
kiss
one
of
his
hand
with
all
her
might
;
whilst
the
other
,
I
suppose
,
be
engage
in
hold
her
to
his
heart
(
which
her
head
just
about
reach
)
and
in
prevent
her
from
tumble
down
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
murmur
something
about
 
<EOS>
forgive
 
dear
William
 
dear
,
dear
,
dear
friend
 
kiss
,
kiss
,
kiss
,
and
so
forth
 
<EOS>
and
in
fact
go
on
under
the
cloak
in
an
absurd
manner
.
  
<EOS>
when
Emmy
emerge
from
it
,
she
still
keep
tight
hold
of
one
of
William
's
hand
,
and
look
up
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
full
of
sadness
and
tender
love
and
pity
.
 
<EOS>
She
understand
its
reproach
and
hang
down
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
time
you
send
for
me
,
dear
Amelia
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
