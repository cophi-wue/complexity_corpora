<EOS>
treat
of
the
place
where
Oliver
Twist
be
bear
and
of
the
circumstance
attend
his
birth
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
public
building
in
a
certain
town
,
which
for
many
reason
it
will
be
prudent
to
refrain
from
mention
,
and
to
which
I
will
assign
no
fictitious
name
,
there
be
one
anciently
common
to
most
town
,
great
or
small
:
 
to
wit
,
a
workhouse
;
and
in
this
workhouse
be
bear
;
on
a
day
and
date
which
I
need
not
trouble
myself
to
repeat
,
inasmuch
as
it
can
be
of
no
possible
consequence
to
the
reader
,
in
this
stage
of
the
business
at
all
event
;
the
item
of
mortality
whose
name
be
prefix
to
the
head
of
this
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
after
it
be
usher
into
this
world
of
sorrow
and
trouble
,
by
the
parish
surgeon
,
it
remain
a
matter
of
considerable
doubt
whether
the
child
would
survive
to
bear
any
name
at
all
;
in
which
case
it
be
somewhat
more
than
probable
that
these
memoir
would
never
have
appear
;
or
,
if
they
have
,
that
be
comprise
within
a
couple
of
page
,
they
would
have
possess
the
inestimable
merit
of
be
the
most
concise
and
faithful
speciman
of
biography
,
extant
in
the
literature
of
any
age
or
country
.
   
<EOS>
although
I
be
not
dispose
to
maintain
that
the
be
bear
in
a
workhouse
,
be
in
itself
the
most
fortunate
and
enviable
circumstance
that
can
possibly
befall
a
human
being
,
I
do
mean
to
say
that
in
this
particular
instance
,
it
be
the
good
thing
for
Oliver
Twist
that
could
by
possibility
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
there
be
considerable
difficulty
in
induce
Oliver
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
respiration
,
---
a
troublesome
practice
,
but
one
which
custom
have
render
necessary
to
our
easy
existence
;
and
for
some
time
he
lie
gasp
on
a
little
flock
mattress
,
rather
unequally
poise
between
this
world
and
the
next
:
 
the
balance
be
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
if
,
during
this
brief
period
,
Oliver
have
be
surround
by
careful
grandmother
,
anxious
aunt
,
experienced
nurse
,
and
doctor
of
profound
wisdom
,
he
would
most
inevitably
and
indubitably
have
be
kill
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
by
,
however
,
but
a
pauper
old
woman
,
who
be
render
rather
misty
by
an
unwonted
allowance
of
beer
;
and
a
parish
surgeon
who
do
such
matter
by
contract
;
<EOS>
Oliver
and
Nature
fight
out
the
point
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
be
,
that
,
after
a
few
struggle
,
Oliver
breathe
,
sneeze
,
and
proceed
to
advertise
to
the
inmate
of
the
workhouse
the
fact
of
a
new
burden
have
be
impose
 
upon
the
parish
,
by
set
up
as
loud
a
cry
as
could
reasonably
have
be
expect
from
a
male
infant
who
have
not
be
possess
of
that
very
useful
appendage
,
a
voice
,
for
a
much
long
space
of
time
than
three
minute
and
a
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
as
Oliver
give
this
first
proof
of
the
free
and
proper
action
of
his
lung
,
the
patchwork
coverlet
which
be
carelessly
fling
over
the
iron
bedstead
,
rustle
;
the
pale
face
of
a
young
woman
be
raise
feebly
from
the
pillow
;
and
a
faint
voice
imperfectly
articulate
the
word
<EOS>
,
"
let
me
see
the
child
,
and
die
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
surgeon
have
be
sit
with
his
face
turn
towards
the
fire
:
 
give
the
palm
of
his
hand
a
warm
and
a
rub
alternately
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
young
woman
speak
,
he
rise
,
and
advance
to
the
bed
's
head
,
say
,
with
more
kindness
than
may
have
be
expect
of
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
must
not
talk
about
die
yet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
bless
her
dear
heart
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
interpose
the
nurse
,
hastily
deposit
in
her
pocket
a
green
glass
bottle
,
the
content
of
which
she
have
be
taste
in
a
corner
with
evident
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lor
bless
her
dear
heart
,
when
she
have
live
as
long
as
I
have
,
sir
,
and
have
thirteen
child
of
her
own
,
and
all
on
'em
dead
except
two
,
and
them
in
the
wurkus
with
me
<EOS>
,
she
will
know
better
than
to
take
on
in
that
way
,
bless
her
dear
heart
!
 
<EOS>
think
what
it
be
to
be
a
mother
,
there
be
a
dear
young
lamb
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
apparently
this
consolatory
perspective
of
a
mother
's
prospect
fail
in
produce
its
due
effect
.
 
<EOS>
the
patient
shake
her
head
,
and
stretch
out
her
hand
towards
the
child
.
   
<EOS>
the
surgeon
deposit
it
in
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
She
imprint
her
cold
white
lip
passionately
on
its
forehead
;
pass
her
hand
over
her
face
;
gaze
wildly
round
;
shudder
;
fall
back
---
and
die
.
<EOS>
They
chafe
her
breast
,
hand
,
and
temple
;
but
the
blood
have
stop
forever
.
 
<EOS>
They
talk
of
hope
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
stranger
too
long
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
over
,
Mrs
Thingummy
!
"
say
the
surgeon
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
poor
dear
,
so
it
be
!
"
say
the
nurse
,
pick
up
the
cork
of
the
green
bottle
,
which
have
fall
out
on
the
pillow
,
as
she
stoop
to
take
up
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
poor
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
mind
send
up
to
me
,
if
the
child
cry
,
nurse
,
"
say
the
surgeon
,
put
on
his
glove
with
great
deliberation
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
likely
it
WILL
be
troublesome
.
 
<EOS>
give
it
a
little
gruel
if
it
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
put
on
his
hat
,
and
,
pause
by
the
bed
-
side
on
his
way
to
the
door
,
add
,
"
She
be
a
good
-
looking
girl
,
too
;
<EOS>
where
do
she
come
from
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
bring
here
last
night
,
"
reply
the
old
woman
,
"
by
the
overseer
's
order
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
find
lie
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
walk
some
distance
,
for
her
shoe
<EOS>
be
wear
to
piece
;
but
where
she
come
from
,
or
where
she
be
go
to
,
nobody
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
the
surgeon
lean
over
the
body
,
and
raise
the
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
old
story
,
"
he
say
,
shake
his
head
:
 
"
no
wedding
-
ring
<EOS>
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
good
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
the
medical
gentleman
walk
away
to
dinner
;
and
the
nurse
,
have
once
more
apply
herself
to
the
green
bottle
,
sit
down
on
a
low
chair
before
the
fire
,
and
proceed
to
dress
the
infant
.
   
<EOS>
what
an
excellent
example
of
the
power
of
dress
,
young
Oliver
Twist
be
!
 
<EOS>
wrap
in
the
blanket
which
have
hitherto
form
his
only
covering
,
he
may
have
be
the
child
of
a
nobleman
or
a
beggar
;
it
would
have
be
hard
for
the
haughty
stranger
to
have
assign
him
his
proper
station
in
society
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
that
he
be
envelop
in
the
old
calico
robe
which
have
grow
yellow
in
the
same
service
,
he
be
badge
and
ticket
,
and
fall
into
his
place
at
once
---
a
parish
child
---
the
orphan
of
a
workhouse
---
the
humble
,
half
-
starve
drudge
---
to
be
cuff
and
buffet
through
the
world
---
despise
by
all
,
and
pity
by
none
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
cry
lustily
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
know
that
he
be
an
orphan
,
leave
to
the
tender
mercy
of
church
-
warden
and
overseer
,
perhaps
he
would
have
cry
the
loud
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
2
.
<EOS>
treat
of
Oliver
Twist
's
growth
,
education
,
and
board
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
next
eight
or
ten
month
,
Oliver
be
the
victim
of
a
systematic
course
of
treachery
and
deception
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
bring
up
by
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
hungry
and
destitute
situation
of
the
infant
orphan
be
duly
report
by
the
workhouse
authority
to
the
parish
authority
.
 
<EOS>
the
parish
authority
inquire
with
dignity
of
the
workhouse
authority
,
whether
there
be
no
female
then
domicile
in
"
the
house
"
who
be
in
a
situation
to
impart
to
Oliver
Twist
,
the
consolation
and
nourishment
of
which
he
stand
in
need
.
 
<EOS>
the
workhouse
authority
reply
with
humility
,
that
there
be
not
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
parish
authority
magnanimously
and
humanely
resolve
,
that
Oliver
should
be
"
farm
,
"
or
,
in
other
word
,
that
he
should
be
dispatch
to
a
branch
-
workhouse
some
three
mile
off
,
where
twenty
or
thirty
other
juvenile
offender
against
the
poor
-
law
,
roll
about
the
floor
all
day
,
without
the
inconvenience
of
too
much
food
or
too
much
clothing
,
under
the
parental
superintendence
of
an
elderly
female
,
who
receive
the
culprit
at
and
for
the
consideration
of
sevenpence
-
halfpenny
per
small
head
per
week
.
 
<EOS>
Sevenpence
-
halfpenny
's
worth
per
week
be
a
good
round
diet
for
a
child
;
a
great
deal
may
be
get
for
sevenpence
-
halfpenny
,
quite
enough
to
overload
its
stomach
,
and
make
it
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
the
elderly
female
be
a
woman
of
wisdom
and
experience
;
she
know
what
be
good
for
child
;
and
she
have
a
very
accurate
perception
of
what
be
good
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
she
appropriate
the
great
part
of
the
weekly
stipend
to
her
own
use
,
and
consign
the
rise
parochial
generation
to
even
a
short
allowance
than
be
originally
provide
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
thereby
find
in
the
low
depth
a
deep
still
;
and
prove
herself
a
very
great
experimental
philosopher
.
   
<EOS>
everybody
know
the
story
of
another
experimental
philosopher
who
have
a
great
theory
about
a
horse
be
able
to
live
without
eat
,
and
who
demonstrate
it
so
well
,
that
he
have
get
his
own
horse
down
to
a
straw
a
day
,
and
would
unquestionably
have
render
him
a
very
spirited
and
rampacious
animal
on
nothing
at
all
,
if
he
have
not
die
,
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
before
he
be
to
have
have
his
first
comfortable
bait
of
air
.
 
<EOS>
unfortunately
for
,
the
experimenal
philosophy
of
the
female
to
whose
protect
care
Oliver
Twist
be
deliver
over
,
a
similar
result
usually
attend
the
operation
of
HER
system
;
for
at
the
very
moment
when
the
child
have
contrive
to
exist
upon
the
small
possible
portion
of
the
weak
possible
food
,
it
do
perversely
happen
in
eight
and
a
half
case
out
of
ten
,
either
that
it
sicken
from
want
and
cold
,
or
fall
into
the
fire
from
neglect
,
or
get
half
-
smother
by
accident
;
in
any
one
of
which
case
,
the
miserable
little
being
be
usually
summon
into
another
world
,
and
there
gather
to
the
father
it
have
never
know
in
this
.
   
<EOS>
occasionally
,
when
there
be
some
more
than
usually
interesting
inquest
upon
a
parish
child
who
have
be
overlook
in
turn
up
a
bedstead
,
or
inadvertently
scald
to
death
when
there
happen
to
be
a
washing
---
though
the
latter
accident
be
very
scarce
,
anything
approach
to
a
washing
being
of
rare
occurance
in
the
farm
---
the
jury
would
take
it
into
their
head
to
ask
troublesome
question
,
or
the
parishioner
would
rebelliously
affix
their
signature
to
a
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
impertinence
be
speedily
check
by
the
evidence
of
the
surgeon
,
and
the
testimony
of
the
beadle
;
the
former
of
whom
have
always
open
the
body
and
find
nothing
inside
(
which
be
very
probable
indeed
)
,
and
the
latter
of
whom
invariably
swear
whatever
the
parish
want
;
which
be
very
self
-
devotional
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
the
board
make
periodical
pilgrimage
to
the
farm
,
and
always
send
the
beadle
the
day
before
,
to
say
they
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
be
neat
and
clean
to
behold
,
when
they
go
;
and
what
more
would
the
people
have
!
   
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
expect
that
this
system
of
farming
would
produce
any
very
extraordinary
or
luxuriant
crop
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
Twist
's
ninth
birthday
find
him
a
pale
thin
child
,
somewhat
diminutive
in
stature
,
and
decidely
small
in
circumference
.
 
<EOS>
but
nature
or
inheritance
have
implant
a
good
sturdy
spirit
in
Oliver
's
breast
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
have
plenty
of
room
to
expand
,
thank
to
the
spare
diet
of
the
establishment
;
and
perhaps
to
this
circumstance
may
be
attribute
his
have
any
ninth

at
all
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as

however

Mr

in

he
give

little
wicket

tremendous
shake

a
kick
which

:
   
<EOS>
the
member
of
this
board
be
very
sage
,
deep
,
philosophical
man
;
and
when
they
come
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
workhouse
,
they
find
out
at
once
,
what
ordinary
folk
would
nver
have
discover
---
the
poor
people
like
it
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
regular
place
of
public
entertainment
for
the
poor
class
;
a
tavern
where
there
be
nothing
to
pay
;
a
public
breakfast
,
dinner
,
tea
,
and
supper
all
the
year
round
;
a
brick
and
mortar
elysium
,
where
it
be
all
play
and
no
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
say
the
board
,
look
very
knowing
;
"
we
be
the
fellow
to
set
this
to
right
;
we
will
stop
it
all
,
in
no
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
,
they
establish
the
rule
,
that
all
poor
people
should
have
the
alternative
(
for
they
would
compel
nobody
,
not
they
)
,
of
be
starve
by
a
gradual
process
in
the
house
,
or
by
a
quick
one
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
they
contract
with
the
water
-
work
to
lay
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
water
;
and
with
a
corn
-
factor
to
supply
periodically
small
quantity
of
oatmeal
;
and
issue
three
meal
of
thin
gruel
a
day
,
with
an
onion
twice
a
week
,
and
half
a
roll
of
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
a
great
many
other
wise
and
humane
regulation
,
have
reference
to
the
lady
,
which
it
be
not
necessary
to
repeat
;
kindly
undertake
to
divorce
poor
married
people
,
in
consequence
of
the
great
expense
of
a
suit
in
doctor
'
Commons
;
and
,
instead
of
compel
a
man
to
support
his
family
,
as
they
have
theretofore
do
,
take
his
family
away
from
him
,
and
make
him
a
bachelor
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
say
how
many
applicant
for
relief
,
under
these
last
two
head
,
may
have
start
up
in
all
class
of
society
,
if
it
have
not
be
couple
with
the
workhouse
;
but
the
board
be
long
-
head
man
,
and
have
provide
for
this
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
the
relief
be
inseparable
from
the
workhouse
and
the
gruel
;
and
that
frighten
people
.
   
<EOS>
for
the
first
six
month
after
Oliver
Twist
be
remove
,
the
system
be
in
full
operation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
expensive
at
first
,
in
consequence
of
the
increase
in
the
undertaker
's
bill
,
and
the
necessity
of
take
in
the
clothe
of
all
the
pauper
,
which
flutter
loosely
on
their
waste
,
shrink
form
,
after
a
week
or
two
's
gruel
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
number
of
workhouse
inmate
get
thin
as
well
as
the
pauper
;
and
the
board
be
in
ecstasy
.
   
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
the
boy
be
feed
,
be
a
large
stone
hall
,
with
a
copper
at
one
end
:
 
out
of
which
the
master
,
dress
in
an
apron
for
the
purpose
,
and
assist
by
one
or
two
woman
,
ladle
the
gruel
at
mealtime
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
festive
composition
each
boy
have
one
porringer
,
and
no
more
---
except
on
occasion
of
great
public
rejoicing
,
when
he
have
two
ounce
and
a
quarter
of
bread
besides
.
   
<EOS>
the
bowl
never
want
washing
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
polish
them
with
their
spoon
till
they
shine
again
;
and
when
they
have
perform
this
operation
(
which
never
take
very
long
,
the
spoon
be
nearly
as
large
as
the
bowl
)
,
they
would
sit
stare
at
the
copper
,
with
such
eager
eye
,
as
if
they
could
have
devour
the
very
brick
of
which
it
be
compose
;
employ
themselves
,
meanwhile
,
in
suck
their
finger
most
assiduously

with

of
catch
up
any
stray
splash
of
gruel
that
may

be
cast
thereon

generally
excellent

<EOS>
Oliver
Twist
and
his
companion
suffer
the
torture
of
slow
starvation
for
three
month
:
 
<EOS>
at
last
they
get
so
voracious
and
wild
with
hunger
,
that
one
boy
,
who
be
tall
for
his
age

and
have
not

sort
of
thing
(
for
his
father
have
keep
a
small
cook

,
hint
darkly
to
his
companion
,
that
unless
he
have
another
basin
of
gruel
per

he
be
afraid
he
may
some
night
happen
to

the

youth

He

the

offer
a
reward
of
five
pound
to
anybody

<EOS>
"

as

at

next
morning
:
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
as
I
purpose
to
show
in
the
sequel
whether
the
white
waistcoate
gentleman
be
right

not
,
I
should
perhaps
mar
the
interest
of
this

(
suppose
it

possess
any
at

,
if
I
venture

Chapter
3
.
<EOS>
relate
how
Oliver
Twist
be
very
near
get
a
place
which
Would
not
have
be
a
sinecure
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
week
after
the
commission
of
the
impious
and
profane
offence
of
ask
for
more
,
Oliver
remain
a
close
prisoner
in
the
dark
and
solitary
room
to
which
he
have
be
consign
by
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
the
board
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
,
at
first
sight
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
,
that
,
if
he
have
entertain
a
become
feeling
of
respect
for
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
,
he
would
have
establish
that
sage
individual
's
prophetic
character
,
once
and
for
ever
,
by
tie
one
end
of
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
a
hook
in
the
wall
,
and
attach
himself
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
performance
of
this
feat
,
however
,
there
be
one
obstacle
:
 
<EOS>
namely
,
that
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
be
decide
article
of
luxury
,
have
be
,
for
all
future
time
and
age
,
remove
from
the
nose
of
pauper
by
the
express
order
of
the
board
,
in
council
assemble
:
 
solemnly
give
and
pronounce
under
their
hand
and
seal
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
still
great
obstacle
in
Oliver
's
youth
and
childishness
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
cry
bitterly
all
day
;
and
,
when
the
long
,
dismal
night
come
on
,
spread
his
little
hand
before
his
eye
to
shut
out
the
darkness
,
and
crouch
in
the
corner
,
try
to
sleep
:
 
ever
and
anon
wake
with
a
start
and
tremble
,
and
draw
himself
closer
and
closer
to
the
wall
,
as
if
to
feel
even
its
cold
hard
surface
be
a
protection
in
the
gloom
and
loneliness
which
surround
him
.
   
<EOS>
let
it
not
be
suppose
by
the
enemy
of
"
the
system
,
"
that
,
during
the
period
of
his
solitary
incarceration
,
Oliver
be
deny
the
benefit
of
exercise
,
the
pleasure
of
society
,
or
the
advantage
of
religious
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
exercise
,
it
be
nice
cold
weather
,
and
he
be
allow
to
perform
his
ablution
every
morning
under
the
pump
,
in
a
stone
yard
,
in
the
presence
of
Mr
Bumble
,
who
prevent
his
catch
cold
,
and
cause
a
tingling
sensation
to
pervade
his
frame
,
by
repeated
application
of
the
cane
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
society
,
he
be
carry
every
other
day
into
the
hall
where
the
boy
dine
,
and
there
sociably
flog
as
a
public
warning
and
example
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
for
from
be
deny
the
advantage
of
religious
consolation
,
he
be
kick
into
the
same
apartment
every
evening
at
prayer
-
time
,
and
there
permit
to
listen
to
,
and
console
his
mind
with
,
a
general
supplication
of
the
boy
,
contain
a
special
clause
,
therein
insert
by
authority
of
the
board
,
in
which
they
entreat
to
be
make
good
,
virtuous
,
contented
,
and
obedient
,
and
to
be
guard
from
the
sin
and
vice
of
Oliver
Twist
:
 
whom
the
supplication
distinctly
set
forth
to
be
under
the
exclusive
patronage
and
protection
of
the
power
of
wickedness
,
and
an
article
direct
from
the
manufactory
of
the
very
Devil
himself
.
   
<EOS>
It
chance
one
morning
,
while
Oliver
's
affair
be
in
this
auspicious
and
confortable
state
,
that
Mr
Gamfield
,

in
his
mind
his
way
and
mean
of
pay
certain
arrear
of
rent
,
for
which
his
landlord
have
become
rather
pressing
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
's
most
sanguine
estimate
of
his
finance
could
not
raise
them
within
full
five
pound
of
the
desire
amount
;
and
,
in
a
species
of
arthimetical
desperation
,
he
be
alternately
cudgel
his
brain
and
his
donkey
,
when
pass
the
workhouse
,
his
eye
encounter
the
bill
on
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo
---
o

"
say
Mr
Gamfield
to
the
donkey
.
   
<EOS>
the
donkey
be
in
a
state
of
profound
abstraction
:
 
wondering
,
probably
,
whether
he
be
destine
to
be
regale
with
a
cabbage
-
stalk
or
two
when
he
have
dispose
of
the
two
sack
of
soot
with
which
the
little
cart
be
laden
;
so
,
without
notice
the
word
of
command
,
he
jog
onward
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
growl
a
fierce
imprecation
on
the
donkey
generally
,
but
more
particularly
on
his
eye
;
and
,
run
after
him
,
bestow
a
blow
on
his
head
,
which
would
inevitably
have
beat
in
any
skull
but
a
donkey
's
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
catch
hold
of
the
bridle
,
he
give
his
jaw
a
sharp
wrench
,
by
way
of
gentle
reminder
that
he
be
not
his
own
master
;
and
by
these
mean
turn
him
round
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
give
him
another
blow
on
the
head
,
just
to
stun
him
till
he
come
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
have
complete
these
arrangement
,
he
walk
up
to
the
gate
,
to

.
   
<EOS>
the

with
the
white

at
the
gate
with
his
hand
behind
him
,
after
have
deliver
himself
of
some
profound
sentiment
in
the
board
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
have
witness
the
little
dispute
between
Mr
Gamfield
and
the
donkey
,
he
smile
joyously
when
that
person
come
up
to
read
the
bill
,
for
he
see
at
once
that
Mr
Gamfield
be
exactly
the
sort
of
master
Oliver
Twist
want
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gamfield
smile
,
too
,
as
he
peruse
the
document
;
for
five
pound
be
just
the
sum
he
have
be
wish
for
;
and
,
as
to
the

so

his
mirth

a
look
from
Mr
Limbkins
.
 
<EOS>
the
board
then
procedde
to
converse
among
themselves
for
a
few
minute
,
but
in
so
low
a
tone
,
that
the
word

well
in

their
solemnity

Mr

We

as
Mr

do
happen
to
labour
under
the
slight
imputation
of
have
bruise
three

four
boy

death
already
,
it
occur
to
him
that
the
board
have
,
perhaps
,
in
some
unaccountable
freak
,
take
it
into
their
head
that
this
extraneous
circumstance
ought
to
influence
their
proceeding
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
unlike
their
general
mode
of
do
business
,
if
they
have
;
but
still
,
as
he
have
no
particular
wish
to
revive
the

he
twist
his

<EOS>
at
this
tremendous
sight
,
Oliver
begin
to
cry
very
piteously
:
 
thinking
,
not
unnaturally
,
that
the
board
must
have
determine
to
kill
him
for
some
useful
purpose
,
or
they
never
would
have
begin

fatten
him
up
in
that
way

<EOS>
as
Mr

pause
to
take
breath

after

this
address
in
an
awful
voice

sob
bitterly

gruel

be
a
very
foolish
action

Oliver

"
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
be
,
for
there
be
quite
enough
water
in
it
already
.
   
<EOS>
on
their
way
to
the
magistrate
,
Mr
Bumble
instruct
Oliver
that
all
he
would
have
to
do
,
would
be
to
look
very
happy
,
and
say
,
when
the
gentleman
ask
him
if
he
want
to
be
apprentice
,
that
he
should
like
it
very
much
indeed
;
both
of
which
injunction
Oliver
promise
to
obey

the
rather
as
Mr

in
a
gentle
hint
,
that
if
he
fail
in
either
particular
,
there
be
no

<EOS>
when

shut
up
in
a
little
room
by

,
and
admonish
by
Mr

there
,
until

<EOS>
there

with
a
palpitate
heart
,
for
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
Mr

thrust
in
his
head
,
unadorned
with
the
cocked
hat
,
and
say
aloud
:
   
"
now

"
 
<EOS>
as
Mr
Bumble
say
this
,
he
put
on
a
grim
and
threatening
look
,
and
add
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"

<EOS>
Oliver

innocently
in

somewhat
contradictory
style
of

a
mingled
expression

fear

too
palpable
to

<EOS>
Mr

shake

gloomy

wish

whereunto
Mr
Gamfield
reply

that
he
wish

which

although

<EOS>
Oliver

make
his

entry
into
public
life

<EOS>
in

,
when

either
in

or

,
for
the
young
man
who

grow
up
,
it
be
a
very
general
custom
to
send
him
to
sea
.
 
<EOS>
the
board
,
in
imitation
of
so
wise
and
salutary
an
example
,
take
counsel
together
on
the
expediency
of
ship
off
Oliver
Twist
,
in
some
small
trading
vessel
bind
to
a
good
unhealthy
port
.
 
<EOS>
this
suggest
itself
as
the
very
good
thing
that
could
possibly
be
do
with
him
:
the
probability
be
,
that
the
skipper
would
flog
him
to
death
,
in
a
playful
mood
,
some
day
after
dinner
,
or
would
knock
his
brain
out
with
an
iron
bar
;
both
pastime
be
,
as
be
pretty
generally
know
,
very
favourite
and
common
recreation
among
gentleman

class

<EOS>
the
more
the
case
present
itself
to
the
board
,
in
this
point
of
view
,
the
more
manifold
the
advantage
of
the
step
appear
;
so
,
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
of
provide
for
Oliver
effectually
,
be
to
send
him
to
sea
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
Mr

have
be
despatch
to
make
various
preliminary
inquiry

with
the
view
of
find
out
some
captain

other
who
want
a
cabin

boy
without
any
friend

and
be
return
to

when
he

at
the
gate

<EOS>
His

but
he

professional
jocosity

<EOS>
His
step
be
elastic

and
his
face
betoken
inward
pleasantry

as
he

to
Mr

shake
him
cordially
by

"

"
You

the
undertaker
in
a
tone

half
dispute
the

of
the
event

<EOS>
"
the
price
allow
by
the

very
small

Mr

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
so

reply
the
beadle
:
 
with
precisely
as
near
an
approach
to
a
laugh
as
a
great
official
ought
to
indulge
in
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
be
much
tickle
at
this

as
of

he
ought
to
be
;
and
laugh
a
long
time
without

<EOS>
"

at

there

the
coffin

something
narrow

more
shallow

have
some

Mr

continue
the
undertaker

resume
the
current
of
observation
which
the
beadle
have
interrupt
:
"
though
I
must
say
,
Mr

that
I
have
to
contend

very
great
disadvantage

that
all

off

me
tell
you

Mr

that
three

four
inch
over

make
a
great
hole

<EOS>
as
Mr

say
this

with

Mr

feel

convey
a

that
evening

upon
like

a

that
if
the

upon
a
short
trial
,
that
he
can
get
enough
work
out
of
a
boy
without
put

much
food

he

when
little
Oliver

he
be
to
go
,
that
night
,
as
general
house

lad
to
a
coffin

maker

that
if
he
complain
of
his
situation

ever
come
back

he
would
be
send

now
,
although
it

very
natural
that
the

should
feel
in
a
great
state
of
virtuous
astonishment

horror
at
the
small
token
of
want
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
anybody
,
they
be
rather
out
,
in
this
particular
instance

<EOS>
the
simple
fact
be
,
that
Oliver
,
instead
of
possess
too
little
feeling
,
possess
rather
too
much
;
and
be
in
a
fair
way
of
be
reduce

have
have
his
luggage
put

which
be
not
very
difficult

carry

it
be
all
comprise
within
the
limit
of
a
brown
paper
parcel
,
about
half
a
foot
square
by
three
inch
deep
---
he
pull
his

over
his

and
once
more
attach
himself
to
Mr

coat
cuff

be

for

Mr

draw
Oliver

lip

and
her
eye
be
bright
and
pierce
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
be
afriad
to
look
at
either
her
or
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
so
like
the
rat
he
have
see
outside
.
   
<EOS>
"
nobody
shall
go
near
her
,
"
say
the
man
,
start
fiercely
up
,
as
the
undertaker
approach
the
recess
.
 
<EOS>
"
keep
back
!
<EOS>
damn
you
,
keep
back
,
if
you
have
a
life
to
lose
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
nonsense
,
my
good
man
,
"
say
the
undertaker
,
who
be
pretty
well
used
to
misery
in
all
its
shape
.
 
<EOS>
"
nonsense
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
say
the
man
:
 
clench
his
hand
,
and
stamp
furiously
on
the
floor
,
---
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
will
not
have
her
put
into
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
rest
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
worm
would
worry
her
---
not
eat
her
---
<EOS>
she
be
so
worn
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
undertaker
offer
no
reply
to
this
raving
;
but
produce
a
tape
from
his
pocket
,
knelt
down
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
body
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
man
:
 
burst
into
tear
,
and
sink
on
his
knee
at
the
foot
of
the
dead
woman
;
"
kneel
down
,
kneel
down
 
---
kneel
round
her
,
every
one
of
you
,
and
mark
my
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
she
be
starve
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
know
how
bad
she
be
,
till
the
fever
come
upon
her
;
and
then
her
bone
be
start
through
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
neither
fire
nor
candle
;
she
die
in
the
dark
---
in
the
dark
!
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
even
see
her
child
's
face
,
though
we
hear
her
gasping
out
their
name
.
<EOS>
I
beg
for
her
in
the
street
:
 
and
they
send
me
to
prison
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
back
,
she
be
die
;
and
all
the
blood
in
my
heart
have
dry
up
,
for
they
starve
her
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
swear
it
before
the
God
that
see
it
!
<EOS>
They
starve
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
twine
his
hand
in
his
hair
;
and
,
with
a
loud
scream
,
roll
grovel
upon
the
floor
:
 
his
eye
fix
,
and
the
foam
cover
his
lip
.
   
<EOS>
the
terrified
child
cry
bitterly
;
but
the
old
woman
,
who
have
hitherto
remain
as
quiet
as
if
she
have
be
wholly
deaf
to
all
that
pass
,
menace
them
into
silence
.
 
<EOS>
have
unloosen
the
cravat
of
the
man
who
still
remain
extended
on
the
ground
,
she
totter
towards
the
undertaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
my
daughter
,
"
say
the
old
woman
,
nod
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
corpse
;
and
speak
with
an
idiotic
leer
,
more
ghastly
than
even
the
presence
of
death
in
such
a
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lord
,
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
strange
that
I
who
give
birth
to
her
,
and
be
a
woman
then
,
should
be
alive
and
merry
now
,
and
she
lie
ther
:
 
so
cold
and
stiff
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
---
to
think
of
it
;
it
be
as
good
as
a
play
---
as
good
as
a
play
!
"
   
<EOS>
as
the
wretched
creature
mumble
and
chuckle
in
her
hideous
merriment
,
the
undertaker
turn
to
go
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
stop
,
stop
!
"
say
the
old
woman
in
a
loud
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
she
be
bury
to

morrow
,
or
next
day
,
or
to

night
?
 
<EOS>
I
lay
her
out
;
and
I
must
walk
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
send
me
a
large
cloak
:
a
good
warm
one
:
for
it
be
bitter
cold
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
have
cake
and
wine
,
too
,
before
we
go
!
 
<EOS>
never
mind
;
send
some
bread
---
only
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
have
some
bread
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
eagerly
:
   
catch
at
the
undertaker
's
coat
,
as
he
once
more
move
towards
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
the
undertaker
,
"
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
anything
you
like
!
"
<EOS>
He
disengage
himself
from
the
old
woman
's
grasp
;
and
,
draw
Oliver
after
him
,
hurry
away
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
(
the
family
have
be
meanwhile
relieved
with
a
half
-
quartern
loaf
and
a
piece
of
cheese
,
leave
with
them
by
Mr
Bumble
himself
,
)
<EOS>
Oliver
and
his
master
return
to
the
miserable
abode
;
where
Mr
Bumble
have
already
arrive
,
accompany
by
four
man
from
the
workhouse
,
who
be
to
act
as
bearer
.
 
<EOS>
an
old
black
cloak
have
be
throw
over
the
rag
of
the
old
woman
and
the
man
;
and
the
bare
coffin
have
be
screw
down
,
be
hoist
on
the
shoulder
of
the
bearer
,
and
carry
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
you
must
put
your
good
leg
foremost
,
old
lady
!
"
<EOS>
whisper
Sowerberry
in
the
old
woman
's
ear
;
"
we
be
rather
late
;
and
it
will
not
do
,
to
keep
the
clergyman
wait
.
 
<EOS>
Move
on
,
my
man
,
---
as
quick
as
you
like
!
"
   
<EOS>
thus
direct
,
the
bearer
trot
on
under
their
light
burden
;
and
the
two
mourner
keep
as
near
them
,
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
and
Sowerberry
walk
at
a
good
smart
pace
in
front
;
and
Oliver
,
whose
leg
be
not
so
long
as
his
master
's
,
run
by
the
side
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
not
so
great
a
necessity
for
hurrying
as
Mr
Sowerberry
have
anticipate
,
however
;
for
when
they
reach
the
obscure
corner
of
the
churchyard
in
which
the
nettle
grow
,
and
where
the
parish
grave
be
make
,
the
clergyman
have
not
arrive
;
and
the
clerk
,
who
be
sit
by
the
vestry
-
room
fire
,
seem
to
think
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
may
be
an
hour
or
so
,
before
he
come
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
they
put
the
bi
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
;
and
the
two
mourner
wait
patiently
in
the
damp
clay
,
with
a
cold
rain
drizzle
down
,
while
the
ragged
boy
whom
the
spectacle
have
attract
into
the
churchyard
play
a
noisy
game
at
hide
-
and
-
seek
among
the
tombstone
,
or
varied
their
amusement
by
jump
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerberry
and
Bumble
,
be
personal
friend
of
the
clerk
,
sit
by
the
fire
with
him
,
and
read
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
after
a
lapse
of
something
more
than
an
hour
,
Mr
Bumble
,
and
Sowerberry
,
and
the
clerk
,
be
see
run
towards
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
afterwards
,
the
clergyman
appear
:
put
on
his
surplice
as
he
come
along
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
then
thrash
a
boy
or
two
,
to
keep
up
appearance
;
and
the
reverend
gentleman
,
have
read
as
much
of
the
burial
service
as
could
be
compress
into
four
minute
,
give
his
surplice
to
the
clerk
,
and
walk
away
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
Bill
!
"
say
Sowerberry
to
the
grave
-
digger
.
 
<EOS>
"
fill
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
no
very
difficult
task
,
for
the
grave
be
so
full
,
that
the
uppermost
coffin
be
within
a
few
foot
of
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
the
grave
-
digger
shovel
in
the
earth
;
stamp
it
loosely
down
with
his
foot
:
 
shoulder
his
spade
;
and
walk
off
,
follow
by
the
boy
,
who
murmur
very
loud
complaint
at
the
fun
be
over
so
soon
.
   
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
good
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
say
Bumble
,
tap
the
man
on
the
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
want
to
shut
up
the
yard
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
never
once
move
,
since
he
have
take
his
station
by
the
grave
side
,
start
,
raise
his
head
,
stare
at
the
person
who
have
address
him
,
walk
forward
for
a
few
pace
;
and
fall
down
in
a
swoon
.
 
<EOS>
the
crazy
old
woman
be
too
much
occupy
in
bewail
the
loss
of
her
cloak
(
which
the
undertaker
have
take
off
)
,
to
pay
him
any
attention
;
so
they
throw
a
can
of
cold
water
over
him
;
and
when
he
come
to
,
see
him
safely
out
of
the
churchyard
,
lock
the
gate
,
and
depart
on
their
different
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Oliver
,
"
say
Sowerberry
,
as
they
walk
home
,
"
how
do
you
like
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
pretty
well
,
thank
you
,
sir
"
reply
Oliver
,
with
considerable
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
very
much
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
will
get
used
to
it
in
time
,
Oliver
,
"
say
Sowerberry
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
when
you
are
used
to
it
,
my
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
wonder
,
in
his
own
mind
,
whether
it
have
take
a
very
long
time
to
get
Mr
Sowerberry
use
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
think
it
better
not
to
ask
the
question
;
and
walk
back
to
the
shop
:
think
over
all
he
have
see
and
hear
.

Chapter
6
.
<EOS>
Oliver
,
be
goad
by
the
taunt
of
Noah
,
rouse
into
action
,
and
rather
astonish
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
month
's
trial
over
,
Oliver
be
formally
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
nice
sickly
season
just
at
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
in
commercial
phrase
,
coffin
be
look
up
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
week
,
Oliver
acquire
a
great
deal
of
experience
.
 
<EOS>
the
success
of
Mr
Sowerberry
's
ingenious
speculation
,
exceed
even
his
most
sanguine
hope
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
inhabitant
recollect
no
period
at
which
measle
have
be
so
prevalent
,
or
so
fatal
to
infant
existence
;
and
many
be
the
mournful
procession
which
little
Oliver
head
,
in
a
hat
-
band
reach
down
to
his
knee
,
to
the
indescribable
admiration
and
emotion
of
all
the
mother
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
as
Oliver
accompany
his
master
in
most
of
his
adult
expedition
too
,
in
order
that
he
may
acquire
that
equanimity
of
demeanour
and
full
command
of
nerve
which
be
essential
to
a
finished
undertaker
,
he
have
many
opportunity
of
observe
the
beautiful
resignation
and
fortitude
with
which
some
strong
-
minded
people
bear
their
trial
and
loss
.
   
<EOS>
for
instance
;
when
Sowerberry
have
an
order
for
the
burial
of
some
rich
old
lady
or
gentleman
,
who
be
surround
by
a
great
number
of
nephew
and
niece
,
who
have
be
perfectly
inconsolable
during
the
previous
illness
,
and
whose
grief
have
be
wholly
irrepressible
even
on
the
most
public
occasion
,
they
would
be
as
happy
among
themselves
as
need
be
---
quite
cheerful
and
contented
---
converse
together
with
as
much
freedom
and
gaiety
,
as
if
nothing
whatever
have
happen
to
disturb
them
.
 
<EOS>
husband
,
too
,
bear
the
loss
of
their
wife
with
the
most
heroic
calmness
.
<EOS>
wife
,
again
,
put
on
weed
for
their
husband
,
as
if
,
so
far
from
grieve
in
the
garb
of
sorrow
,
they
have
make
up
their
mind
to
render
it
as
become
and
attractive
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
observable
,
too
,
that
lady
and
gentleman
who
be
in
passion
of
anguish
during
the
ceremony
of
interment
,
recover
almost
as
soon
as
they
reach
home
,
and
become
quite
compose
before
the
tea
-
drinking
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
very
pleasant
and
improve
to
see
;
and
Oliver
behold
it
with
great
admiration
.
   
<EOS>
that
Oliver
Twist
be
move
to
resignation
by
the
example
of
these
good
people
,
I
can
not
,
although
I
be
his
biographer
,
undertake
to
affirm
with
any
degree
of
confidence
;
but
I
can
most
distinctly
say
,
that
for
many
month
he
continue
meekly
to
submit
to
the
domination
and
ill
-
treatment
of
Noah
Claypole
:
 
who
use
him
far
worse
than
before
,
now
that
his
jealousy
be
rouse
by
see
the
new
boy
promote
to
the
black
stick
and
hatband
,
while
he
,
the
old
one
,
remain
stationary
in
the
muffin
-
cap
and
leather
.
 
<EOS>
Charlotte
treat
him
ill
,
because
Noah
do
;
and
Mrs
Sowerberry
be
his
decide
enemy
,
because
Mr
Sowerberry
be
dispose
to
be
his
friend
;
so
,
between
these
three
on
one
side
,
and
a
glut
of
funeral
on
the
other
,
Oliver
be
not
altogether
as
comfortable
as
the
hungry
pig
be
,
when
he
be
shut
up
,
by
mistake
,
in
the
grain
department
of
a
brewery
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
I
come
to
a
very
important
passage
in
Oliver
's
history
;
for
I
have
to
record
an
act
,
slight
and
unimportant
perhaps
in
appearance
,
but
which
indirectly
produce
a
material
change
in
all
his
future
prospect
and
proceeding
.
   
<EOS>
one
day
,
Oliver
and
Noah
have
descend
into
the
kitchen
at
the
usual
dinner
-
hour
,
to
banquet
upon
a
small
joint
of
mutton
---
a
pound
and
a
half
of
the
bad
end
of
the
neck
---
when
Charlotte
be
call
out
of
the
way
,
there
ensue
a
brief
interval
of
time
,
which
Noah
Claypole
,
be
hungry
and
vicious
,
consider
he
could
not
possibly
devote
to
a
worthy
purpose
than
aggravate
and
tantalise
young
Oliver
Twist
.
   
<EOS>
intent
upon
this
innocent
amusement
,
Noah
put
his
foot
on
the
table
-
cloth
;
and
pull
Oliver
's
hair
;
and
twitch
his
ear
;
and
express
his
opinion
that
he
be
a
"
sneak
"
;
and
furthermore
announce
his
intention
of
come
to
see
him
hang
,
whenever
that
desirable
event
should
take
place
;
and
enter
upon
various
topic
of
petty
annoyance
,
like
a
malicious
and
ill
-
condition
charity
-
boy
as
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
make
Oliver
cry
,
Noah
attempt
to
be
more
facetious
still
;
and
in
his
attempt
,
do
what
many
sometimes
do
to
this
day
,
when
they
want
to
be
funny
.
 
<EOS>
He
get
rather
personal
.
   
<EOS>
"
Work'us
,
"
say
Noah
,
"
how
be
your
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
dead
,
"
reply
Oliver
;
"

working

Oliver

boldly

<EOS>
an
answer
so
different
from
the
one
he
have
expect
to
elicit
,
and
be
in
the
habit
of
receive
,
staggered
Mr

not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
step
back
from
the
keyhole
;
draw
himself
up
to
his
full
height
;
and
look
from

Mrs

<EOS>
"
no
boy
in
half
his
sense
could
venture
to
speak
so
to
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
Madness

madam

reply
Mr

after
a
few
moment
of
deep
meditation

<EOS>
"
It
be
Meat

Mrs

with
stern
emphasis

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
You
have
raise
a
artificial

will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
what
have
pauper
to
do
with
soul

<EOS>
It
be
quite
enough
that
we
let

<EOS>
if
you
have

the

her
eye
to
the
kitchen
ceiling
:
 
<EOS>
"
this

"
   
<EOS>
the
liberality
of
Mrs

to
Oliver
,
have
consist
of
a
profuse
bestowal
upon
him
of
all
the
dirty
odd
and
end
which
nobody
else
would
eat
;
so
there
be
a
great
deal
of
meekness
and
self

devotion
in
her
voluntarily
remain
under
Mr

's
heavy
accusation
.
 
<EOS>
of
which

to
do
her
justice
,
she

wholly
innocent

in

word

<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Mr

,
when
the
lady

her
eye
down
to
earth
again
;
"
the
only
thing
that

that
I

so

out

all
through
the
apprenticeship

<EOS>
He
come
of
a
bad
family

<EOS>
excitable

both

that

against
difficulty
and
pain
that
would
have

dispose

"
   
<EOS>
at
this
point
of
Mr
Bumble
's
discourse
,
Oliver
,
just
hear
enough
to
know
that
some
allusion
be
be
make
to
his
mother
,
recommence
kicking
,
with
a
violence
that
render
every
other
sound
inaudible
.
 
<EOS>
Sowerberry
return
at
this
juncture
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
's
offence
have
be
explain
to
him
,
with
such
exaggeration
as
the
lady
think
best
calculate
to
rouse
his
ire
,
he
unlock
the
cellar
-
door
in
a
twinkling
,
and
drag
his
rebellious
apprentice
out
,
by
the
collar
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
's
clothe
have
be
tear
in
the
beating
he
have
receive
;
his
face
be
bruise
and
scratch
;
and
his
hair
scatter
over
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
the
angry
flush
have
not
disappear
,
however
;
and
when
he
be
pull
out
of
his
prison
,
he
scowl
boldly
on
Noah
,
and
look
quite
undismayed
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
you
be
a
nice
young
fellow
,
be
not
you
?
"
<EOS>
say
Sowerberry
;
give
Oliver
a
shake
,
and
a
box
on
the
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
call
my
mother
name
,
"
reply
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
what
if
he
do
,
you
little
ungrateful
wretch
?
"
say
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
deserve
what
he
say
,
and
bad
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
"
say
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
do
,
"
say
Mrs
Sowerberry
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
lie
!
"
say
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sowerberry
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
.
   
<EOS>
this
flood
of
tear
leave
Mr
Sowerberry
no
alternative
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
hesitate
for
one
instant
to
punish
Oliver
most
severely
,
it
must
be
quite
clear
to
every
experienced
reader
that
he
would
have
be
,
accord
to
all
precedent
in
dispute
of
matrimony
establish
,
a
brute
,
an
unnatural
husband
,
an
insulting
creature
,
a
base
imitation
of
a
man
,
and
various
other
agreeable
character
too
numerous
for
recital
within
the
limit
of
this
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
to
do
him
justice
,
he
be
,
as
far
as
his
power
go
---
it
be
not
very
extensive
---
kindly
disposed
towards
the
boy
;
perhaps
,
because
it
be
his
interest
to
be
so
;
perhaps
,
because
his
wife
dislike
him
.
<EOS>
the
flood
of
tear
,
however
,
leave
him
no
resource
;
so
he
at
once
give
him
a
drubbing
,
which
satisfy
even
Mrs
Sowerberry
herself
,
and
render
Mr
Bumble
's
subsequent
application
of
the
parochial
cane
,
rather
unnecessary
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
rest
of
the
day
,
he
be
shut
up
in
the
back
kitchen
,
in
company
with
a
pump
and
a
slice
of
bread
;
and
at
night
,
Mrs
Sowerberry
,
after
make
various
remark
outside
the
door
,
by
no
means
complimentary
to
the
memory
of
his
mother
,
look
into
the
room
,
and
,
amidst
the
jeer
and
pointing
of
Noah
and
Charlotte
,
order
him
upstairs
to
his
dismal
bed
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
he
be
leave
alone
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
gloomy
workshop
of
the
undertaker
,
that
Oliver
give
way
to
the
feeling
which
the
day
's
treatment
may
be
suppose
likely
to
have
awaken
in
a
mere
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
listen
to
their
taunt
with
a
look
of
contempt
;
he
have
bear
the
lash
without
a
cry
:
for
he
feel
that
pride
swell
in
his
heart
which
would
have
keep
down
a
shriek
to
the
last
,
though
they
have
roast
him
alive
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
there
be
none
to
see
or
hear
him
,
he
fall
upon
his
knee
on
the
floor
;
and
,
hide
his
face
in
his
hand
,
weep
such
tear
as
,
God
send
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
,
few
so
young
may
ever
have
cause
to
pour
out
before
him
!
   
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
,
Oliver
remain
motionless
in
this
attitude
.
<EOS>
the
candle
be
burn
low
in
the
socket
when
he
rise
to
his
foot
.
<EOS>
have
gaze
cautiously
round
him
,
and
listen
intently
,
he
gently
undo
the
fastening
of
the
door
,
and
look
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
cold
,
dark
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
star
seem
,
to
the
boy
's
eye
,
farther
from
the
earth
than
he
have
ever
see
them
before
;
there
be
no
wind
;
and
the
sombre
shadow
throw
by
the
tree
upon
the
ground
,
look
sepulchral
and
death
-
like
,
from
be
so
still
.
<EOS>
He
softly
reclose
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
have
avail
himself
of
the
expire
light
of
the
candle
to
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
the
few
article
of
wear
apparel
he
have
,
sit
himself
down
upon
a
bench
,
to
wait
for
morning
.
   
<EOS>
with
the
first
ray
of
light
that
struggle
through
the
crevice
in
the
shutter
,
Oliver
arise
,
and
again
unbarred
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
one
timid
look
around
---
<EOS>
one
moment
's
pause
of
hesitation
<EOS>
---
he
have
close
it
behind
him
,
and
be
in
the
open
street
.
   
<EOS>
He
look
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
,
uncertain
whither
to
fly
.
   
<EOS>
He
remember
to
have
see
the
waggon
,
as
they
go
out
,
toil
up
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
same
route
;
and
arrive
at
a
footpath
across
the
field
:
 
which
he
know
,
after
some
distance
,
lead
out
again
into
the
road
;
strike
into
it
,
and
walk
quickly
on
.
   
<EOS>
along
this
same
footpath
,
Oliver
well
-
remember
he
have
trot
beside
Mr
Bumble
,
when
he
first
carry
him
to
the
workhouse
from
the
farm
.
 
<EOS>
His
way
lie
directly
in
front
of
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
quickly
when
he
bethink
himself
of
this
;
and
he
half
resolve
to
turn
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
come
a
long
way
though
,
and
should
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
by
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
so
early
that
there
be
very
little
fear
of
his
be
see
;
so
he
walk
on
.
   
<EOS>
He
reach
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
appearance
of
its
inmate
stir
at
that
early
hour
.

Oliver

and
peep
into
the
garden

as
he

his
pale

and
disclose
the
feature
of
one
of
his
former
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
feel
glad
to
see
him
,
before
he
go
;
for
,
though
young
than
himself
,
he
have
be
his
little
friend
and
playmate
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
beat
,
and
starve
,
and
shut
up
together
,
many
and
many
a
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush

say
Oliver

<EOS>
I
know
the

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Oliver
walk
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
encounter
on
the
road
a
strange
sort
of
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
reach
the
stile
at
which
the
by
-
path
terminate
;
and
once
more
gain
the
high
-
road
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
eight
o'clock
now
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
nearly
five
mile
away
from
the
town
,
he
run
,
and
hide
behind
the
hedge
,
by
turn
,
till
noon
:
 
fear
that
he
may
be
pursue
and
overtake
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
sit
down
to
rest
by
the
side
of
the
milestone
,
and
begin
to
think
,
for
the
first
time
,
where
he
have
better
go
and
try
to
live
.
   
<EOS>
the
stone
by
which
he
be
seat
,
bore
,
in
large
character
,
an
intimation
that
it
be
just
seventy
mile
from
that
spot
to
London
.
<EOS>
the
name
awaken
a
new
train
of
idea
in
the
boy
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
London
!
<EOS>
---
that
great
place
!
<EOS>
---
nobody
---
not
even
Mr
Bumble
---
could
ever
find
him
there
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
often
hear
the
old
man
in
the
workhouse
,
too
,
say
that
no
lad
of
spirit
nee
want
in
London
;
and
that
there
be
way
of
live
in
that
vast
city
,
which
those
who
have
be
breed
up
in
country
part
have
no
idea
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
very
place
for
a
homeless
boy
,
who
must
die
in
the
street
unless
some
one
help
him
.
<EOS>
as
these
thing
pass
through
his
thought
,
he
jump
upon
his
foot
,
and
again
walk
forward
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
diminish
the
distance
between
himself
and
London
by
full
four
mile
more
,
before
he
recollect
how
much
he
must
undergo
ere
he
could
hope
to
reach
his
place
of
destination
.
<EOS>
as
this
consideration
force
itself
upon
him
,
he
slacken
his
pace
a
little
,
and
meditate
upon
his
mean
of
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
crust
of
bread
,
a
coarse
shirt
,
and
two
pair
of
stocking
,
in
his
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
penny
too
---
a
gift
of
Sowerberry
's
after
some
funeral
in
which
he
have
acquit
himself
more
than
ordinarily
well
---
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
clean
shirt
,
"
think
Oliver
,
"
be
a
very
comfortable
thing
;
and
so
be
two
pair
of
darn
stocking
;
and
so
be
a
penny
;
but
they
small
help
to
a
sixty
-
five
mile
'
walk
in
winter
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
Oliver

thought
,
like
those
of
most
other
people
,
although
they
be
extremely
ready
and
active
to
point
out
his
difficulty
,
be
wholly
at
a
loss
to
suggest
any
feasible
mode
of
surmount
them
;
so
,
after
a
good
deal
of
think
to
no
particular
purpose
,
he
change
his
little
bundle
over
to
the
other
shoulder
,
and
trudge
on
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
walk
twenty
mile
that
day
;
and
all
that
time
taste
nothing
<EOS>
but
the
crust
of
dry
bread
,
and
a
few
draught
of
water
,
which
he
beg
at
the
cottage
-
door
by
the
road
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
night
come
,
he
turn
into
a
meadow
;
and
,
creep
close
under
a
hay
-
rick
,
determine
to
lie
there
,
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
frightened
at
first
,
for
the
wind
moan
dismally
over
the
empty
field
:
 
and
he
be
cold
and
hungry
,
and
more
alone
than
he
have
ever
feel
before
.
 
<EOS>
be
very
tired
with
his
walk
,
however
,
he
soon
fall
asleep
and
forget
his
trouble
.
   
<EOS>
He
feel
cold
and
stiff
,
when
he
get
up
next
morning
,
and
so
hungry
that
he
be
oblige
to
exchange
the
penny
for
a
small
loaf
,
in
the
very
first
village
through
which
he
pass
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
walk
no
more
than
twelve
mile
,
when
night
close
in
again
.
<EOS>
His
foot
be
sore
,
and
his
leg
so
weak
that
they
tremble
beneath
him
.
 
<EOS>
another
night
pass
in
the
bleak
damp
air
,
make
him
bad
;
when
he
set
forward
on
his
journey
next
morning
he
could
hardly
crawl
along
.
   
<EOS>
He
wait
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
hill
till
a
stage
-
coach
come
up
,
and
then
beg
of
the
outside
passenger
;
but
there
be
very
few
who
take
any
notice
of
him
:
 
and
even
those
tell
him
to
wait
till
they
get
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
then
let
them
see
how
far
he
could
run
for
a
halfpenny
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Oliver
try
to
keep
up
with
the
coach
a
little
way
,
but
be
unable
to
do
it
,
by
reason
of
his
fatigue
and
sore
foot
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
outside
see
this
,
they
put
their
halfpence
back
into
their
pocket
again
,
declare
that
he
be
an
idle
young
dog
,
and
do
not
deserve
anything
;
and
the
coach
rattle
away
and
leave
only
a
cloud
of
dust
behind
.
   
<EOS>
in
some
village
,
large
paint
board
be
fix
up
:
warn
all
person
who
beg
within
the
district
,
that
they
would
be
send
to
jail
.
 
<EOS>
this
frightened
Oliver
very
much
,
and
make
him
glad
to
get
out
of
those
village
with
all
possible
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
in
other
,
he
would
stand
about
the
inn
-
yards
,
and
look
mournfully
at
every
one
who
pass
:
a
proceeding
which
generally
terminate
in
the
landlady
's
order
one
of
the
post
-
boy
who
be
lounge
about
,
to
drive
that
strange
boy
out
of
the
place
,
for
she
be
sure
he
have
come
to
steal
something
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
beg
at
a
farmer
's
house
,
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
they
threaten
to
set
the
dog
on
him
;
and
when
he
show
his
nose
in
a
shop
,
they
talk
about
the
beadle
---
which
bring
Oliver
's
heart
into
his
mouth
,
---
very
often
the
only
thing
he
have
there
,
for
many
hour
together
.
   
<EOS>
in
fact
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
a
good
-
hearted
turnpike
-
man
,
and
a
benevolent
old
lady
,
Oliver
's
trouble
would
have
be
shorten
by
the
very
same
process
which
have
put
an
end
to
his
mother
's
;
in
other
word
,
he
would
most
assuredly
have
fall
dead
upon
the
king
's
highway
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
turnpike
-
man
give
him
a
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
;
and
the
old
lady
,
who
have
a
shipwreck
grandson
wander
barefoot
in
some
distant
part
of
the
earth
,
take
pity
upon
the
poor
orphan
,
and
give
him
what
little
she
could
afford
---
and
more
---
with
such
kind
and
gently
word
,
and
such
tear
of
sympathy
and
compassion
,
that
they
sink
deeper
into
Oliver
's
soul
,
than
all
the
suffering
he
have
ever
undergo
.
   
<EOS>
early
on
the
seventh
morning
after
he
have
leave
his
native
place
,
Oliver
limp
slowly
into
the
little
town
of
Barnet
.
<EOS>
the
window
-
shutter
be
close
;
the
street
be
empty
;
not
a
soul
have
awaken
to
the
business
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
be
rise
in
all
its
splendid
beauty
;
but
the
light
only
serve
to
show
the
boy
his
own
lonesomeness
and
desolation
,
as
he
sit
,
with
bleed
foot
and
cover
with
dust
,
upon
a
door
-
step
.
   
<EOS>
by
degree
,
the
shutter
be
open
;
the
window
-
blind
be
draw
up
;
and
people
begin
pass
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
some
few
stop
to
gaze
at
Oliver
for
a
moment
or
two
,
or
turn
round
to
stare
at
him
as
they
hurry
by
;
but
none
relieve
him
,
or
trouble
themselves
to
inquire
how
he
come
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
heart
to
beg
.
<EOS>
and
there
he
sit
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
be
crouch
on
the
step
for
some
time
:
 
wonder
at
the
great
number
of
public
-
house
(
every
other
house
in
Barnet
be
a
tavern
,
large
or
small
)
,
gaze
listlessly
at
the
coach
as
they
pass
through
,
and
think
how
strange
it
seem
that
they
could
do
,
with
ease
,
in
a
few
hour
,
what
it
have
take
him
a
whole
week
of
courage
and
determination
beyond
his
year
to
accomplish
:
 
when
he
be
rouse
by
observe
that
a
boy
,
who
have
pass
him
carelessly
some
minute
before
,
have
return
,
and
be
now
survey
him
most
earnestly
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
little
heed
of
this
at
first
;
but
the
boy
remain
in
the
same
attitude
of
close
observation
so
long
,
that
Oliver
raise
his
head
,
and
return
his
steady
look
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
boy
cross
over
;
and
walk
close
up
to
Oliver
,
say
   
"
Hullo
,
my
covey
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
row
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
boy
who
address
this
inquiry
to
the
young
wayfarer
,
be
about
his
own
age
:
 
but
one
of
the
queer
looking
boy
that
Oliver
have
even
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
snub
-
nosed
,
flat
-
browed
,
common
-
faced
boy
enough
;
and
as
dirty
a
juvenile
as
one
would
wish
to
see
;
but
he
have
about
him
all
the
air
and
manner
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
short
of
his
age
:
 
with
rather
bow
-
leg
,
and
little
,
sharp
,
ugly
eye
.
 
<EOS>
His
hat
be
stick
on
the
top
of
his
head
so
lightly
,
that
it
threaten
to
fall
off
every
moment
---
and
would
have
do
so
,
very
often
,
if
the
wearer
have
not
have
a
knack
of
every
now
and
then
give
his
head
a
sudden
twitch
,
which
bring
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
man
's
coat
,
which
reach
nearly
to
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
turn
the
cuff
back
,
half
-
way
up
his
arm
,
to
get
his
hand
out
of
the
sleeve
:
apparently
with
the
ultimated
view
of
thrust
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
corduroy
trouser
;
for
there
he
keep
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
altogether
,
as
roystere
and
swagger
a
young
gentleman
as
ever

four
foot
six

or
something
less

"
Hullo

this
strange
young
gentleman
to
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
hungry
and
tired

reply
Oliver
:
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
the
young
gentelman
smile
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
the
latter
fragment
of
discourse
be
playfully
ironical
;
and
finish
the
beer
as
he
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
this
unexpected
offer
of
shelter
be
too
tempting

be
resist
;
especially
as
it
be
immediately
follow
up

by
the
assurance
that
the
old
gentleman
refer
to
,
would
doubtless
provide
Oliver
with
a
comfortable
place
,
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
this
lead
to
a
more
friendly
and
confidential
dialogue
;
from
which
Oliver
discover
that
his
friend
's
name
be
Jack
Dawkins
,
and
that
he
be
a
peculiar
pet
and
protege
of
the
elderly
gentleman
before

<EOS>
Mr
Dawkin
's
appearance
do
not
say
a
vast
deal
in
favour
of
the
comfort
which
his
patron
's
interest
obtain
for
those
whom
he
take
under
his
protection
;
but
,
as
he
have
a
rather
flightly
and
dissolute
mode
of
conversing
,
and
furthermore
avow
that
among
his
intimate
friend
he
be
better
know
by
the
sobriquet
of
"
the
Artful
Dodger
,
"
<EOS>
Oliver
conclude
that
,
be
of
a
dissipated
and
careless
turn
,
the
moral
precept
of
his
benefactor
have
hitherto
be
throw
away
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
under
this
impression
,
he
secretly
resolve
to
cultivate
the
good
opinion
of
the
old
gentleman
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
,
if
he
find
the
Dodger
incorrigible
,
as
he
more
than
half
suspect
he
should
,
to
decline
the
honour
of
his
farth
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
as
John

object
to
their
enter
London
before
nightfall
,
it
be
nearly
eleven
o'clock
when
they
reach
the
turnpike
at
Islington

<EOS>
They
cross
from
the
Angel
into
St

Road

strike
down
the
small
street
which
terminate
at
Sadler

Wells
Theatre
;
through
Exmouth
Street
and
Coppice
Row
;
down
the
little
court

across

classic
ground
which

bear
the
name
of

the

hole
;
thence
into
Little
Saffron
Hill

so
into
Saffron
Hill
the

:
 
along

the
Dodger
scud
at
a
rapid
pace

direct
Oliver

although
Oliver
have
enough

He

<EOS>
these
civility

for

the

boisterous
shout
from

merry
old

<EOS>
in

water

tell

Chapter

<EOS>
contain
further
particular
concern
the
pleasant
old
gentleman
,
and
his
hopeful
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
late
next
morning
when
Oliver
awake
,
from
a
sound
,
long
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
person
in
the
room
but
the
old
Jew
,
who
be
boil
some
coffee
in
a
saucepan
for
breakfast
,
and
whistle
softly
to
himself
as
he
stir
it
round
and
round
,
with
an
iron
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
stop
every
now
and
then
to
listen
when
there
be
the
least
noise
below
:
and
when
he
have
satistifie
himself
,
he
would
go
on
whistle
and
stirring
again
,
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
although
Oliver
have
rouse
himself
from
sleep
,
he
be
not
thoroughly
awake
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
drowsy
state
,
between
sleep
and
wake
,
when
you
dream
more
in
five
minute
with
your
eye
half
open
,
and
yourself
half
conscious
of
everything
that
be
pass
around
you
,
than
you
would
in
five
night
with
your
eye
fast
closed
,
and
your
sense
wrapt
in
perfect
unconsciousness
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
time
,
a
mortal
know
just
enough
of
what
his
mind
be
do
,
to
form
some
glimmer
conception
of
its
mighty
power
,
its
bounding
from
earth
and
spurn
time
and
space
,
when
free
from
the
restraint
of
its
corporeal
associate
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
be
precisely
in
this
condition
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
the
Jew
with
his
half
-
close
eye
;
hear
his
low
whistling
;
and
recognise
the
sound
of
the
spoon
grate
against
the
saucepan
's
side
:
 
and
yet
the
self
-
same
sense
be
mentally
engage
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
busy
action
with
almost
everybody
he
have
ever
know
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
coffee
be
do
,
the
Jew
draw
the
saucepan
to
the
hob
.
<EOS>
standing
,
then
in
an
irresolute
attitude
for
a
few
minute
,
as
if
he
do
not
well
know
how
to
employ
himself
,
he
turn
round
and
look
at
Oliver
,
and
call
him
by
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
answer
,
and
be
to
all
appearance
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
after
satisfiye
himself
upon
this
head
,
the
Jew
step
gently
to
the
door
:
 
which
he
fasten
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
draw
forth
:
 
as
it
seem
to
Oliver
,
from
some
trap
in
the
floor
:
 
a
small
box
,
which
he
place
carefully
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
glisten
as
he
raise
the
lid
,
and
look
in
.
 
<EOS>
drag
an
old
chair
to
the
table
,
he
sit
down
;
and
take
from
it
a
magnificent
gold
watch
,
sparkle
with
jewel
.
   
<EOS>
"
aha
!
"
say
the
Jew
,
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
and
distort
every
feature
with
a
hideous
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
clever
dog
!
 
<EOS>
clever
dog
!
<EOS>
staunch
to
the
last
!
 
<EOS>
never
tell
the
old
parson
where
they
be
.
<EOS>
never
poach
upon
old
Fagin
!
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
they
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
loosen
the
knot
,
or
keep
the
drop
up
,
a
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
no
,
no

no

<EOS>
fine
fellow

<EOS>
fine
fellow

"
   
<EOS>
with
these
,
and
other
muttered
reflection
of
the
like
nature
,
the
Jew
once
more
deposit
the
watch
in
its
place
of
safety
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
half
a
dozen
more
be
severally
draw
forth
from
the
same
box
,
and
survey
with
equal
pleasure
;
besides
ring
,
brooch
,
bracelet
,
and
other
article
of
jewellery
,
of
such
magnificent
material
,
and
costly
workmanship
,
that
Oliver
have
no
idea
,
even
of
their
name
.
   
<EOS>
have
replace
these
trinket
,
the
Jew
take
out
another
:
 
so
small
that
it
lie
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
some
very
minute
inscription
on
it
;
for
the
Jew
lay
it
flat
upon
the
table
,
and
shade
it
with
his
hand
,
pore
over
it
,
long
and
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
put
it
down
,
as
if
despairing
of
success
;
and
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
,
mutter
:
   
"
what
a
fine
thing
capital
punishment
be
!
 
<EOS>
dead
man
never
repent
;
dead
man
never
bring
awkward
story
to
light
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
it
be
a
fine
thing
for
the
trade
!
 
<EOS>
five
of
'em
string
up
in
a
row
,
and
none
leave
to
play
booty
,
or
turn
white
-
livere

"
   
<EOS>
as
the
Jew
utter
these
word
,
his
bright
dark
eye
,
which
have
be
stare
vacantly
before
him
,
fall
on
Oliver
's
face
;
the
boy
's
eye
be
fix
on
his
in
mute
curiousity
;
and
although
the
recognition
be
only
for
an
instant
---
for
the
brief
space
of
time
that
can
possibly
be
conceive
---
it
be
enough
to
show
the
old
man
that
he
have
be
observe
.
   
<EOS>
He
close
the
lid
of
the
box
with
a
loud
crash
;
and
,
lay
his
hand
on
a
bread
knife
which
be
on
the
table
,
start
furiously
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
tremble
very
much
though
;
for
,
even
in
his
terror
,
Oliver
could
see
that
the
knife
quiver
in
the
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
what

"
I

reply
Oliver

meekly
.

cry
the

with
a
still
fiercer

a
threatening
attitude

"
upon
my

the
Jew
,
abruptly
resume
his
old
manner
,
and
play
with
the
knife
a
little
,
before
he
lay
it
down
;
as
if
to
induce
the
belief
that
he
have
catch
it
up
,
in
mere
sport
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
know

the
Jew
rub
his
hand
with
a
chuckle
,
but
glance
uneasily
at
the
box
,
notwithstanding
.
   
<EOS>
"
do

pretty

lay
his

after
a
short
pause

reply
Oliver

<EOS>
"

rather
pale

<EOS>
Oliver
think
the
old
gentleman
must
be
a
decide
miser
to
live
in
such
a
dirty
place
,
with
so
many
watch
;
but
,
think
that
perhaps
his
fondness
for
the
Dodger
and
the
other
boy
,
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
money
,
he
only
cast
a
deferential
look
at
the
Jew
,
and
ask
if
he
may

"

Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
Master
Bates
see
something
so
exquisitely
ludicrous
in
this
reply
,
that
he
burst
into
another
laugh
;
which
laugh
,
meet
the
coffee
he
be
drink
,
and
carry
it
down
some
wrong
channel

very
nearly

<EOS>
"
He

so
jolly
green

"
say
Charley
when
he

,
as
an
apology

<EOS>
the
Dodger
say
nothing
,
but
he
smooth
Oliver
's
hair
over
his
eye
,
and
say
he
would
know
better
,
by
and
by
;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
,
observe
Oliver

colour
mount
,
change
the
subject
by
ask
whether
there
have
be
much
of
a
crowd
at
the
execution
that
morning
?
 
<EOS>
this
make
him
wonder
more
and
more
;
for
it
be
plain
from
the
reply
of
the
two
boy
that
they
have
both
be
there
;
and
Oliver
naturally
wonder
how
they
could
possibly
have
find
time
to
be
so
very
industrious
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
breakfast
be
clear
away
;
the
merry
old
gentlman
and
the
two
boy
play
at
a
very
curious
and
uncommon
game
,
which
be
perform
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
merry
old
gentleman
,
place
a
snuff
-
box
in
one
pocket
of
his
trouser
,
a
note
-
case
in
the
other
,
and
a
watch
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
with
a
guard
-
chain
round
his
neck
,
and
stick
a
mock
diamond
pin
in
his
shirt
<EOS>
:
button
his
coat
tight
round
him
,
and
put
his
spectacle
-
case
and
handkerchief
in
his
pocket
,
trot
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
stick
,
in
imitation
of
the
manner
in
which
old
gentlman
walk
about
the
street
any
hour
in
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
stop
at
the
fire
-
place
,
and
sometimes
at
the
door
,
make
believe
that
he
be
stare
with
all
his
might
into
shop
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
time
,
he
would
look
constantly
round
him
,
for
fear
of
thief
,
and
would
keep
slap
all
his
pocket
in
turn
,
to
see
that
he
have
not
lose
anything
,
in
such
a
very
funny
and
natural
manner
,
that
Oliver
laugh
till
the
tear
run
down
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
the
two
boy
follow
him
closely
about
:
 
get
out
of
his
sight
,
so
nimbly
,
every
time
he
turn
round
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
follow
their
motion
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
Dodger
trod
upon
his
toe
,
or
run
upon
his
boot
accidentally
,
while
Charley
Bates
stumble
up
against
him
behind
;
and
in
that
one
moment
they
take
from
him
,
with
the
most
extraordinary
rapidity
,
snuff
-
box
,
note
-
case
,
watch
-
guard
,
chain
,
shirt
-
pin
,
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
even
the
spectacle
-
case
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
old
gentlman
feel
a
hand
in
any
one
of
his
pocket
,
he
cry
out
where
it
be
;
and
then
the
game
begin
all
over
again
.
   
<EOS>
when

game
have

,
think
that
the

be
so
much
his
senior
,
must
know
best
,

follow
him
quietly
to

Chapter

.
<EOS>
Oliver
become
better
acquaint
with
the
character
of
his
new
associate
;
and
purchase
experience
at
a
high
price
.
<EOS>
be
a
short
,
but
very
important
chapter
,
in
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
for
many
day
,
Oliver
remain
in
the
Jew
's
room
,
pick
the
mark
out
of
the
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
(
of
which
a
great
number
be
bring
home
,
)
and
sometimes
take
part
in
the
game
already
describe
:
 
which
the
two
boy
and
the
Jew
play
,
regularly
,
every
morning
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
he
begin
to
languish
for
fresh
air
,
and
take
many
occasion
of
earnestly
entreat
the
old
gentleman
to
allow
him
to
go
out
to
work
with
his
two
companion
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
be
render
the
more
anxious
to
be
actively
employ
,
by
what
he
have
see
of
the
stern
morality
of
the
old
gentleman
's
character
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
the
Dodger
or
Charley
Bates
come
home
at
night
,
empty
-
handed
,
he
would
expatiate
with
great
vehemence
on
the
misery
of
idle
and
lazy
habit
;
and
would
enforce
upon
them
the
necessity
of
an
active
life
,
by
send
them
supperless
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
,
indeed
,
he
even
go
so
far
as
to
knock
them
both
down
a
flight
of
stair
;
but
this
be
carry
out
his
virtuous
precept
to
an
unusual
extent
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
one
morning
,
Oliver
obtain
the
permission
he
have
so
eagerly
seek
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
handkerchiefs
to
work
upon
,
for
two
or
three
day
,
and
the
dinner
have
be
rather
meagre
.
<EOS>
perhaps
these
be
reason
for
the
old
gentleman
's
give
his
assent
;
but
,
whether
they
be
or
no
,
he
tell
Oliver
he
may
go
,
and
place
him
under
the
joint
guardianship
of
Charley
Bates
,
and
his
friend
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
the
three
boy
sally
out
;
the
Dodger
with
his
coat
-
sleeve
tuck
up
,
and
his
hat
cock
,
as
usual
;
Master
Bates
saunter
along
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
;
and
Oliver
between
them
,
wonder
where
they
be
go
,
and
what
branch
of
manufacture
he
would
be
instruct
in
,
first
.
   
<EOS>
the
pace
at
which
they
go
,
be
such
a
very
lazy
,
ill
-
looking
saunter
,
that
Oliver
soon
begin
to
think
his
companion
be
go
to
deceive
the
old
gentleman
,
by
not
go
to
work
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
Dodger
have
a
vicious
propensity
,
too
,
of
pull
the
cap
from
the
head
of
small
boy
and
toss
them
down
area
;
while
Charley
Bates
exhibit
some
very
loose
notion
concern
the
right
of
property
,
by
pilfer
diver
apple
and
onion
from
the
stall
at
the
kennel
side
,
and
thrust
them
into
pocket
which
be
so
surprisingly
capacious
,
that
they
seem
to
undermine
his
whole
suit
of
clothe
in
every
direction
.
 
<EOS>
these
thing
look
so
bad
,
that
Oliver
be
on
the
point
of
declare
his
intention
of
seek
his
way
back
,
in
the
good
way
he
could
;
when
his
thought
be
suddenly
direct
into
another
channel
,
by
a
very
mysterious
change
of
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
Dodger
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
just
emerge
from
a
narrow
court
not
far
from
the
open
square
in
Clerkenwell
,
which
be
yet
call
,
by
some
strange
perversion
of
term
,
"
The
Green
"
:
 
when
the
Dodger
make
a
sudden
stop
;
and
,
lay
his
finger
on
his
lip
,
draw
his
companion
back
again
,
with
the
great
caution
and
circumspection
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
demand
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
reply
the
Dodger
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
that
old
cove
at
the
book
-
stall
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
old
gentleman
over
the
way
?
<EOS>
"
say
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
will
do

say
the
Doger
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
prime
plant

"
observe
Master
Charley
Bates
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
look
from
one
to
the
other
,
with
the
great
surprise
;
but
he
be
not
permit
to
make
any
inquiry
;
for
the
two
boy
walk
stealthily
across
the
road
,
and
slink
close
behind
the
old
gentleman
towards
whom
his
attention
have
be
direct
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
walk
a
few
pace
after
them
;

,
not

whether
to
advance
or
retire
,
stand
look
on
in
silent
amazement

<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
be
a
very
respectable
-
looking
personage
,
with
a
powdered
head
and
gold
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
a
bottle
-
green
coat
with
a
black
velvet
collar
;
wear
white
trouser
;
and
carry
a
smart
bamboo
cane
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
take
up
a
book
from
the
stall
,
and
there
he
stand
,
read
away
,
as
hard
as
if
he
be
in
his
elbow
-
chair
,
in
his
own
study
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
possible
that
he
fancy
himself
there
,
indeed
;
for
it
be
plain
,
from
his
abstraction
,
that
he
see
not
the
book
-
stall
,
nor
the
street
,
nor
the
boy
,
nor
,
in
short
,
anything
but
the
book
itself
:
 
which
he
be
read
straight
through
:
 
turn
over
the
leaf
when
he
get
to
the
bottom
of
a
page
,
begin
at
the
top
line
of
the
next
one
,
and
go
regularly
on
,
with
the
great
interest
and
eagerness
.
   
<EOS>
what
be
Oliver
's
horror
and
alarm
as
he
stand
a
few
pace
off
,
look
on
with
his
eyelid
as
wide
open
as
they
would
possibly
go
,
to
see
the
Dodger
plunge
his
hand
into
the
old
gentleman
's
pocket
,
and
draw
from
thence
a
handkerchief
!
 
<EOS>
to
see
him
hand
the
same
to
Charley
Bates
;
and
finally
to
behold
them
,
both
run
away
round
the
corner
at
full
speed
!
   
<EOS>
in
an
instant
the
whole
mystery
of
the
hankerchiefs
,
and
the
watch
,
and
the
jewel
,
and
the
Jew
,
rush
upon
the
boy
's
mind
.
   
<EOS>
He
stand
,
for
a
moment
,
with
the
blood
so
tingle
through
all
his
vein
from
terror
,
that
he
feel
as
if
he
be
in
a
burn
fire
;
then
,
confused
and
frightened
,
he
take
to
his
heel
;
and
,
not
know
what
he
do
,
make
off
as
fast
as
he
could
lay
his
foot
to
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
all
do
in
a
minute
's
space

<EOS>
in
the
very
instant
when
Oliver
begin
to
run
,
the
old
gentleman
,
put
his
hand
to
his
pocket
,
and
miss
his
handkerchief
,
turn
sharp
round
.
 
<EOS>
see
the
boy
scud
away
at
such
a
rapid
pace
,
he
very
naturally
conclude
him
to
be
the
depredator
;
and
shout
"
stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
with
all
his
might
,
make
off
after
him
,
book
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
old
gentleman
be
not
the
only
person
who
raise
the
hue
-
and
-
cry
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
,
unwilling
to
attract
public
attention
by
run
down
the
open
street
,
have
merely
reture
into
the
very
first
doorway
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
They
no
sooner
hear
the
cry
,
and
see
Oliver
run
,
than
,
guess
exactly
how
the
matter
stand

they
issue
forth
with
great
promptitude
;
and
,
shout
"

"
<EOS>
too

join
in
the

like

<EOS>
although
Oliver

an
expression

He

this
to

the

a
dirty
court

It

a
small

a
stout
man
with
a
bunch
of
whisker
on
his
face

and
a
bunch
of
key
in

but
I

I

<EOS>
His

a

<EOS>
now
,
young
gallow

"
   
<EOS>
this
be
an
invitation
for
Oliver
to
enter
through
a
door
which
he
unlock
as
he
speak
,
and
which
lead
into
a
stone
cell
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
be
search
;
and
nothing
be
find
upon
him
,
lock
up
.
   
<EOS>
this
cell
be
in
shape
and
size
something
like
an
area
cellar
,
only
not
so
light
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
most
intolerably
dirty
;
for
it
be
Monday
morning

and
it
have

tenant
by
six
drunken
people
,
who
have
be
lock
up

since
Saturday
night

in

woman

confine

the
most
trivial
charge

the
word
be
worth
note

with
which
,
those

<EOS>
let
any
one
who
doubt
this
,

<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
look
almost
as
rueful
as
Oliver
when
the
key
grate
in
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
with
a
sigh
to
the
book
,
which
have
be
the
innocent
cause
of
all
this
disturbance
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
in
that
boy
's
face
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
to
himself
as
he
walk
slowly
away
,
tap
his
chin
with
the
cover
of
the
book
,
in
a
thoughtful
manner
;
"
something
that
touch
and
interest
me
.
 
<EOS>
CAN
he
be
innocent
?
 
<EOS>
He
look
like
---
<EOS>
bye
the
bye
,
"
exclaim
the
old
gentleman
,
halt
very
abruptly
,
and
stare
up
into
the
sky
<EOS>
,
"
bless
my
soul
!
<EOS>
---
where
have
I
see
something
like
that
look
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
after
muse
for
some
minute
,
the
old
gentleman
walk
,
with
the
same
meditative
face
,
into
a
back
anteroom
opening
from
the
yard
;
and
there
,
retire
into
a
corner
,
call
up
before
his
mind
's
eye
a
vast
amphitheatre
of
face
over
which
a
dusky
curtain
have
hang
for
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
,
shake
his
head
;
"
it
must
be
imagination
.
   
<EOS>
He
wander
over
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
call
them
into
view
,
and
it
be
not
easy
to
replace
the
shroud
that
have
so
long
conceal
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
face
of
friend
,
and
foe
,
and
of
many
that
have
be
almost
stranger
peer
intrusively
from
the
crowd
;
there
be
the
face
of
young
and
bloom
girl
that
be
now
old
woman
;
there
be
face
that
the
grave
have
change
and
close
upon
,
but
which
the
mind
,
superior
to
its
power
,
still
dress
in
their
old
freshness
and
beauty
,
call
back
the
lustre
of
the
eye
,
the
brightness
of
the
smile
,
the
beaming
of
the
soul
through
its
mask
of
clay
,
and
whispering
of
beauty
beyond
the
tomb
,
change
but
to
be
heighten
,
and
take
from
earth
only
to
be
set
up
as
a
light
,
to
shed
a
soft
and
gentle
glow
upon
the
path
to
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
old
gentleman
could
recall
no
one
countenance
of
which
Oliver
's
feature
bear
a
trace
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
heave
a
sigh
over
the
recollection
he
awaken
;
and
be
,
happily
for
himself
,
an
absent
old
gentleman
,
bury
them
again
in
the
page
of
the
musty
book
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
rouse
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
,
and
a
request
from
the
man
with
the
key
to
follow
him
into
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
He
close
his
book
hastily
;
and
be
at
once
usher
into
the
impose
presence
of
the

chapter

<EOS>
in
which
Oliver
be
take
well
care
of
than
he
ever
be
before
.
<EOS>
and
in
which
the
narrative
revert
to
the
merry
old
gentleman
and
his
youthful
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
rattle
away
,
over
nearly
the
same
ground
as
that
which
Oliver
have
traverse
when
he
first
enter
London
in
company
with
the
Dodger
;
and
,
turn
a
different
way
when
it
reach
the
Angel
at
Islington
,
stop
at
length
before
a
neat
house
,
in
a
quiet
shady
street
near
Pentonville
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
a
bed

prepared
,
without

of
time
,
in
which
Mr

and
here
,
he
be
tend
with
a
kindness
and
solicitude
that
know
no

<EOS>
but
,
for
many
day
,
Oliver
remain
insensible
to
all
the
goodness
of
his
new
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
rise
and
sink
,
and
rise
and
sink
again
,
and
many
time
after
that
;
and
still
the
boy
lie
stretched
on
his
uneasy
bed
,
dwindle
away
beneath
the
dry
and
waste
heat
of
fever
.
 
<EOS>
the
worm
do
not
work
more
surely
on
the
dead
body
,
than
do
this
slow
creeping
fire
upon
the
live
frame
.
   
<EOS>
weak
,
and
thin
,
and
pallid
,
he
awake
at
last
from
what
seem
to
have
be
a
long
and
troubled
dream
.
 
<EOS>
feebly
raise
himself
in
the
bed
,
with
his
head
rest
on
his
tremble
arm
,
he
look
anxiously
around
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
room
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
where
have
I
be
bring
to
?
"
say
Oliver
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
not
the
place
I
go
to
sleep
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
utter
these
word
in
a
feeble
voice
,
be
very
faint
and
weak
;
but
they
be
overhear
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
the
curtain
at
the
bed
's
head
be
hastily
draw
back
,
and
a
motherly
old
lady
,
very
neatly
and
precisely
dress
,
rise
as
she
undrew
it
,
from
an
arm
-
chair
close
by
,
in
which
she
have
be
sit
at
needle
-
work
.
   
<EOS>
"
hush
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
old
lady
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
very
quiet
,
or
you
will
be
ill
again
;
and
you
have
be
very
bad
,
---
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
,
pretty
nigh
.
 
<EOS>
lie
down
again
;
there
be
a
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
with
those
word
,
the
old
lady
very
gently
place
Oliver
's
head
upon
the
pillow
;
and
,
smooth
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
,
look
so
kindly
and
love
in
his
face
,
that
he
could
not
help
place
his
little
withered
hand
in
hers
,
and
draw
it
round
his
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
save
us
!
"
say
the
old
lady
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
grateful
little
dear
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
creetur
!
 
<EOS>
what
would
his
mother
feel
if
she
have
sit
by
him
as
I
have
,
and
could
see
him
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
she
do
see
me
,
"
whisper
Oliver
,
fold
his
hand
together
;
"
perhaps
she
have
sit
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
feel
as
if
she
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
fever
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
old
lady
mildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
,
"
reply
Oliver
,
"
because
heaven
be
a
long
way
off
;
and
they
be
too
happy
there
,
to
come
down
to
the
bedside
of
a
poor
boy
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
she
know
I
be
ill
,
she
must
have
pity
me
,
even
there
;
for
she
be
very
ill
herself
before
she
die
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
not
know
anything
about
me
though
,
"
add
Oliver
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
she
have
see
me
hurt
,
it
would
have
make
here
sorrowful
;
and
her
face
have
always
look
sweet
and
happy
,
when
I
have
dream
of
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
old
lady
make
no
reply
to
this
;
but
wipe
her
eye
first
,
and
her
spectacle
,
which
lie
on
the
counterpane
,
afterwards
,
as
if
they
be
part
and
parcel
of
those
feature
,
bring
some
cool
stuff
for
Oliver
to
drink
;
and
then
,
pat
him
on
the
cheek
,
tell
him
he
must
lie
very
quiet
,
or
he
would
be
ill
again
.
   
<EOS>
so
,
Oliver
keep
very
still
;
partly
because
he
be
anxious
to
obey
the
kind
old
lady
in
all
thing
;
and
partly
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
because
he
be
completely
exhausted
with
what
he
have
already
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
fall
into
a
gentle
doze
,
from
which
he
be
awaken
by
the
light
of
a
candle
:
 
which
,
be
bring
near
the
bed
,
show
him
a
gentleman
with
a
very
large
and
loud
-
tick
gold
watch
in
his
hand
,
who
feel
his
pulse
,
and
say
he
be
a
great
deal
better
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
great
deal
better
,
be
you
not
,
my
dear
?
"
say
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
reply
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
 
I
know
you
be
,
"
say
the
gentleman
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
hungry
too
,
an't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
answer
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
hem
!
"
say
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
know
you
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
hungry
,
Mrs
Bedwin
,
"
say
the
gentleman
:
 
look
very
wise
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
lady
make
a
respectful
inclination
of
the
head
,
which
seem
to
say
that
she
think
the
doctor
be
a
very
clever
man
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
appear
much
of
the
same
opinion
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
feel
sleepy
,
do
not
you
,
my
dear
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
reply
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
with
a
very
shrewd
and
satisfied
look
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
sleepy
.
 
<EOS>
nor
thirsty
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
rather
thirsty
,
"
answer
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
just
as
I
expect
,
Mrs
Bedwin
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
natural
that
he
should
be
thirsty
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
give
him
a
little
tea
,
madam
,
and
some
dry
toast
without
any
butter
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
keep
him
too
warm
,
madam
;
but
be
careful
that
you
do
not
let
him
be
too
cold
;
will
you
have
the
goodness
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
old
lady
drop
a
curtsey
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
after
taste
the
cool
stuff
,
and
express
a
qualified
approval
of
it
,
hurry
away
:
 
his
boot
creak
in
a
very
important
and
wealthy
manner
as
he
go
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
doze
off
again
,
soon
after
this
;
when
he
awake
,
it
be
nearly
twelve
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
lady
tenderly
bid
him
good
-
night
shortly
afterwards
,
and
leave
him
in
charge
of
a
fat
old
woman
who
have
just
come
:
 
bring
with
her
,
in
a
little
bundle
,
a
small
Prayer
Book
and
a
large
nightcap
.
<EOS>
put
the
latter
on
her
head
and
the
former
on
the
table
,
the
old
woman
,
after
tell
Oliver
that
she
have
come
to
sit
up
with
him
,
draw
her
chair
close
to
the
fire
and
go
off
into
a
series
of
short
nap
,
chequer
at
frequent
interval
with
sundry
tumbling
forward
,
and
diver
moan
and
choking
.
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
have
no
bad
effect
than
cause
her
to
rub
her
nose
very
hard
,
and
then
fall
asleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
and
thus
the
night
creep
slowly
on
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
lie
awake
for
some
time
,
count
the
little
circle
of
light
<EOS>
which
the
reflection
of
the
rushlight
-
shade
throw
upon
the
ceiling
;
or
trace
with
his
languid
eye
the
intricate
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
the
darkness
and
the
deep
stillness
of
the
room
be
very
solemn
;
as
they
bring
into
the
boy
's
mind
the
thought
that
death
have
be
hover
there
,
for
many
day
and
night
,
and
may
yet
fill
it
with
the
gloom
and
dread
of
his
awful
presence
,
he
turn
his
face
upon
the
pillow
,
and
fervently
pray
to
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
gradually
,
he
fall
into
that
deep
tranquil
sleep
which
ease
from
recent
suffering
alone
impart
;
that
calm
and
peaceful
rest
which
it
be
pain
to
wake
from
.
 
<EOS>
who
,
if
this
be
death
,
would
be
rouse
again
to
all
the
struggle
and
turmoil
of
life
;
to
all
its
care
for
the
present
;
its
anxiety
for
the
future
;
more
than
all
,
its
weary
recollection
of
the
past
!
   
<EOS>
It
have
be
bright
day
,
for
hour
,
when
Oliver
open
his
eye
;
he
feel
cheerful
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
the
crisis
of
the
disease
be
safely
past
.
 
<EOS>
He
belong
to
the
world
again
.
   
<EOS>
in
three
day
'
time

be
able
to
sit
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
well
prop
up
with
pillow
;
and
,
as
he
be
still
too
weak
to
walk
,
Mrs
Bedwin
have
him
carry
downstairs
into
the
little
housekeeper
's
room
,
which
belong
to
her

<EOS>
have

here
,
by
the
fire
-

down
too
;
and

in
a
state
of
considerable
delight
at
see
him
so
much
well
<EOS>
,
forthwith
begin
to
cry
most
violently
.
   
<EOS>
"
never

"
say
the
old
lady
;
"
I
be
only

"
You

You

you

<EOS>
Oliver
do
see
it
in
his
mind
's
eye
as
distinctly
as
if
he
have
not
alter
his
position
;
but
he
think
it
better
not
to
worry
the
kind
old
lady
;
so
he
smile
gently
when
she
look
at
him
;
and
Mrs
Bedwin
,
satisfy
that
he
feel
more
comfortable
,
salted
and
break
bit
of
toast
bread
into
the

with
all
the
bustle
befitting
so
solemn
a

Oliver

through
it
with
extraordinary
expedition

<EOS>
He
have
scarcely

the

when
there
come

soft
rap
at

door

<EOS>
"
come
in
,
"
say
the
old
lady
;
and
in
walk
Mr
Brownlow

<EOS>
now
,
the
old
gentleman
come
in
as
brisk
as
need
be
;
but
,
he
have
no
sooner
raise
his
spectacle
on
his
forehead
,
and
thrust
his
hand
behind
the
skirt
of
his
dressing
-
gown
to
take
a
good
long
look
at
Oliver
,
than
his
countenance
undergo
a
very
great
variety
of
odd
contortion
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
look
very
worn
and
shadowy
from
sickness
,
and
make
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
stand
up
,
out
of
respect
to
his
benefactor
,
which
terminate
in
his
sinking
back
into
the
chair
again
;
and
the
fact
be
,
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
that
Mr
Brownlow
's
heart
,
be
large
enough
for
any
six
ordinary
old
gentleman
of
humane
disposition
,
force
a
supply
of
tear
into
his
eye
,
by
some
hydraulic
process
which
we
be
not
sufficiently
philosophical
to
be
in
a
condition
to
explain

<EOS>
"
poor

Mr

clear
his

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
He

a
basin
of
beautiful
strong
broth

reply
Mrs
Bedwin
:
 
draw
herself
up
slightly
,
and
lay
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
:
 
to
intimate
that
between
slop

and
broth
will
compound
,
there
exist
no
affinity
or
connection
whatsoever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ugh
!
"
say
Mr
Brownlow
,
with
a
slight
shudder
;
"
a
couple
of
glass
of
port

have
do

Would

<EOS>
"
My

great
astonishment

Mr

"
   
<EOS>
"
queer

the

<EOS>
"
what
make
you
tell

your

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
tell
him
so
,
sir
,
"
return
Oliver
in
amazement
.
   
<EOS>
this
sound
so
like
a
falsehood
,
that
the
old
gentleman
look
somewhat
sternly
in
Oliver
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
doubt
him
;
there
be
truth
in
every
one
of
its
thin
and
sharpened
lineament
.
   
<EOS>
"
some
mistake
,
"
say
Mr
Brownlow
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
although
his
motive
for
look
steadily
at
Oliver
no
longer
exist
,
the
old
idea
of
the
resemblance
between
his
feature
and
some
familiar
face
come
upon
him
so
strongly
,
that
he
could
not
withdraw
his
gaze
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
be
not
angry
with
me
,
sir
?
"
say
Oliver
,
raise
his
eye
beseechingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
no

no

"
reply
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
!
<EOS>
what
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
Bedwin
,
look
there
!
"
   
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
point
hastily
to
the
picture
over
Oliver
's
head
,
and
then
to
the
boy
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
its
living
copy
.
<EOS>
the
eye
,
the
head
,
the
mouth
;
every
feature
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
the
expression
be
,
for
the
instant
,
so
precisely
alike
,
that
the
minute
line
seem
copy
with
startling
accuracy
!
   
<EOS>
Oliver
know
not
the
cause
of
this
sudden
exclamation
;
for
,
not
be
strong
enough
to
bear
the
start
it
give
him
,
he
faint
away
.
 
<EOS>
a
weakness
on
his
part
,
which
afford
the
narrative
an
opportunity
of
relieve
the
reader
from
suspense
,
in
behalf
of
the
two
young
pupil
of
the
Merry
Old
Gentleman
;
and
of
recording
---
    
that
when
the
Dodger
,
and
his
accomplished
friend
Master
Bates
,
join
in
the
hue
-
and
-
cry
which
be
raise
at
Oliver
's
heel
,
in
consequence
of
their
execute
an
illegal
conveyance
of
Mr
Brownlow
's
personal
property
,
as
have
be
already
describe
<EOS>
,
they
be
actuate
by
a
very
laudable
and
become
regard
for
themselves
;
and
forasmuch
as
the
freedom
of
the
subject
and
the
liberty
of
the
individual
be
among
the
first
and
proud
boast
of
a
true
-
hearted
Englishman
,
so
,
I
need
hardly
beg
the
reader
to
observe
,
that
this
action
should
tend
to
exalt
them
in
the
opinion
of
all
public
and
patriotic
man
,
in
almost
as
great
a
degree
as
this
strong
proof
of
their
anxiety
for
their
own
preservation
and
safety
go
to
corroborate
and
confirm
the
little
code
of
law
which
certain
profound
and
sound
-
judge
philosopher
have
lay
down
as
the
main
-
spring
of
all
Nature
's
deed
and
action
:
 
the
say
philosopher
very
wisely
reduce
the
good
lady
's
proceeding
to
matter
of
maxim
and
theory
:
 
and
,
by
a
very
neat
and
pretty
compliment
to
her
exalted
wisdom
and
understanding
,
put
entirely
out
of
sight
any
consideration
of
heart
,
or
generous
impulse
and
feeling
.
<EOS>
for
,
these
be
matter
totally
beneath
a
female
who
be
acknowledge
by
universal
admission
to
be
far
above
the
numerous
little
foible
and
weakness
of
her
sex
.
   
<EOS>
if
I
want
any
further
proof
of
the
strictly
philosophical
nature
of
the
conduct
of
these
young
gentleman
in
their
very
delicate
predicament
,
I
should
at
once
find
it
in
the
fact
<EOS>
(
also
record
in
a
foregoing
part
of
this
narrative
)
,
of
their
quit
the
pursuit
,
when
the
general
attention
be
fix
upon
Oliver
;
and
make
immediately
for
their
home
by
the
short
possible
cut
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
it
be
usually
the
practice
of
renowned
and
learn
sage
,
to
shorten
the
road
to
any
great
conclusion
(
their
course
indeed
be
rather
to
lengthen
the
distance
,
by
various
circumlocation
and
discursive
staggering
,
like
unto
those
in
which
drunken
man
under
the
pressure
of
a
too
mighty
flow
of
idea
,
be
prone
to
indulge
)
;
still
,
I
do
mean
to
say
,
and
do
say
distinctly
,
that
it
be
the
invariable
practice
of
many
mighty
philosopher
,
in
carry
out
their
theory
,
to
evince
great
wisdom
and
foresight
in
provide
against
every
possible
contingency
which
can
be
suppose
at
all
likely
to
affect
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
to
do
a
great
right
,
you
may
do
a
little
wrong
;
and
you
may
take
any
mean
which
the
end
to
be
attain
,
will
justify
;
the
amount
of
the
right
,
or
the
amount
of
the
wrong
,
or
indeed
the
distinction
between
the
two
,
be
leave
entirely
to
the
philosopher
concern
,
to
be
settle
and
determine
by
his
clear
,
comprehensive
,
and
impartial
view
of
his
own
particular
case
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
the
two
boy
have
scour
,
with
great
rapidity
,
through
a
most
intricate
maze
of
narrow
street
and
court
,
that
they
venture
to
halt
beneath
a
low
and
dark
archway
.
 
<EOS>
have
remain
silent
here
,
just
long
enough
to
recover
breath
to
speak
,
Master
Bates
utter
an
exclamation
of
amusement
and
delight
;
and
,
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
,
fling
himself
upon
a
doorstep
,
and
roll
thereon
in
a
transport
of
mirth

this

see
the
evil

with
which
the
Jew
bite
his
pale
lip
as
he
turn
round
to

he
may
have
think
the
caution
not

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
but
the

shrug
up

his

there

<EOS>
every

not

the

by
a

malicious
licking
of

seem
to
be
meditate
an
attack
upon

"

low

nod
assent

You
must

again

<EOS>
the
prudence
of
this

be
obvious

but
,
unfortunately
,
there
be
one
very
strong
objection
to
its
be
adopt
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
that
the
Dodger

Charley
Bates

Fagin

Mr
William
Sikes

happen
,
one

all

to
entertain
a
violent
and
deeply

root
antipathy
to
go
near
a
police

office
on
any
ground
or
pretext
whatever

<EOS>
how
long
they
may

state
of
uncertainty
<EOS>
not
the
most
pleasant
of

it

difficult
to
guess

<EOS>
It
be
not
necessary
to
make
any
guess
on
the
subject
,
however
;
for
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
two
young

whom
Oliver
have
see
on
a
former
occasion

cause
the
conversation
to

the
Jew
coaxingly

It
be
due
to
the
young
lady
to
say
that
she
do
not
positively
affirm
that
she
would
not

but
that
she
merely
express
an
emphatic
and
earnest
desire
to
be

would
;
a
polite
and
delicate
evasion
of

that
natural

properly

amusing
remark
that

much
breath

it

more
wholesomely

<EOS>
I
promise
you

<EOS>
now
,
let

about
something
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
all
the
information
Oliver
could
obtain
about
the
picture
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
old
lady
have
be
so
kind
to
him
in
his
illness
,
he
endeavour
to
think
no
more
of
the
subject
just
then
;
so
he
listen
attentively
to
a
great
many
story
she
tell
him
,
about
an
amiable
and
handsome
daughter
of
hers
,
who

handsome
man

and
live
in
the
country
;
and
about

who

to
a
merchant
in
the
West
Indies
;
and
who
be
,
also
,
such
a
good
young
man
,
and
write
such
dutiful
letter
home
four
time
a
-
year
,
that
it
bring
the
tear
into
her
eye
to
talk
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
old
lady
have
expatiate
,
a
long
time
,
on
the
excellence
of
her
child
,
and
the
merit
of
her
kind
good
husband
besides
,
who
have
be
dead
and
go
,
poor
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
just
six
-
and
-
twenty
year
,
it
be
time
to
have
tea
.
<EOS>
after
tea
she
begin
to
teach
Oliver
cribbage
:
which
he
learn
as
quickly
as
she
could
teach
:
 
and
at
which
game
they
play
,
with
great
interest
and
gravity
,
until
it
be
time
for
the
invalid
to
have
some
warm
wine
and
water
,
with
a
slice
of
dry
toast
,
and
then
to
go
cosily
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
happy
day
,
those
of
Oliver
's
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
everything
be
so
quiet
,
and
neat
,
and
orderly
;
<EOS>
everybody
so
kind
and
gentle
;
that
after
the
noise
and
turbulence
in
the
midst
of
which
he
have
always
live
,
it
seem
like
Heaven
itself
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
strong
enough
to
put
his
clothe
on
,
properly
,
than
Mr
Brownlow
cause
a
complete
new
suit
,
and
a
new
cap
,
and
a
new
pair
of
shoe
,
to
be
provide
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
Oliver
be
tell
that
he
may
do
what
he
like
with
the
old
clothe
,
he
give
them
to
a
servant
who
have
be
very
kind
to
him
,
and
ask
her
to
sell
them
to
a
Jew
,
and
keep
the
money
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
this
she
very
readily
do
;
and
,
as
Oliver
look
out
of
the
parlour
window
,
and
see
the
Jew
roll
them
up
in
his
bag
and
walk
away
,
he
feel
quite
delighted
to
think
that
they
be
safely
go
,
and
that
there
be
now
no
possible
danger
of
his
ever
be
able
to
wear
them
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
sad
rag
,
to
tell
the
truth
;
and
Oliver
have
never
have
a
new
suit
before
.
   
<EOS>
one
evening
,
about
a
week
after
the
affair
of
the
picture
,
as
he
be
sit
talk
to
Mrs
Bedwin
,
there
come
a
message
down
from
Mr
Brownlow
,
that
if
Oliver
Twist
feel
pretty
well
,
he
should
like
to
see
him
in
his
study
,
and
talk
to
him
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
bless
us
,
and
save
us
!
 
<EOS>
wash
your
hand
,
and
let
me
part
your
hair
nicely
for
you
,
child
,
"
say
Mrs
Bedwin
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
heart
alive
!
 
<EOS>
if
we
have
know
he
would
have
ask
for
you
,
we
would
have
put
you
a
clean
collar
on
,
and
make
you
as
smart
as
sixpence
!
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
do
as
the
old
lady
bade
him
;
and
,
although
she
lament
grievously
,
meanwhile
,
that
there
be
not
even
time
to
crimp
the
little
frill
that
border
his
shirt
-
collar
;
he
look
so
delicate
and
handsome
,
despite
that
important
personal
advantage
,
that
she
go
so
far
as
to
say
:
 
look
at
him
with
great
complacency
from
head
to
foot
,
that
she
really
do
not
think
it
would
have
be
possible
,
on
the
long
notice
,
to
have
make
much
difference
in
him
for
the
well
.
   
<EOS>
thus
encourage
,
Oliver
tap
at
the
study
door
.
 
<EOS>
on
Mr
Brownlow
call
to
him
to
come
in
,
he
find
himself
in
a
little
back
room
,
quite
full
of
book
,
with
a
window
,
look
into
some
pleasant
little
garden
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
table
draw
up
before
the
window
,
at
which
Mr
Brownlow
be
seat
reading
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
see
Oliver
,
he
push
the
book
away
from
him
,
and
tell
him
to
come
near
the
table
,
and
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
comply
;
marvel
where
the
people
could
be
find
to
read
such
a
great
number
of
book
as
seem
to
be
write
to
make
the
world
wise
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
still
a
marvel
to
more
experienced
people
than
Oliver
Twist
,
every
day
of
their
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
good
many
book

"
say
Mr
Brownlow
,
observe
the
curiosity
with
which
Oliver
survey
the
shelf
that
reach
from

floor
to
the
ceiling
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
great
number
,
sir
,
"
reply
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
so
many
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
read
them
,
if
you
behave
well
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
kindly
;
"
and
you
will
like
that
,
well
than
look
at
the
outside

---
that

some
case

because
there
be
book
of
which
the
back

the

"
   
<EOS>
"
I

Oliver
,
point
to
some
large
quarto
,
with
a
good
deal
of
gilding
about
the
binding
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
always
those
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
,
pat
Oliver
on
the
head
,
and
smile
as

so
;

there

other
equally
heavy

though
of
a
much
small
size

<EOS>
how
should
you
like
to
grow
up
a
clever
man
,
and
write
book
,
eh

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
would
rather
read
them

Oliver

<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
would
not
you
like
to
be
a
book

"
say
the
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
consider
a
little
while
;
and
at
last
say
,
he
should
think
it
would
be
a
much
well
thing
to
be
a
book
-
seller
;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
laugh
heartily
,
and
declare
he

say
a
very
good
thing

something
about

<EOS>
"

speak
if
possible
in

kinder
,

at

more
serious
manner

than

exclaim
Oliver

alarm
at
the
serious
tone
of
the
old
gentleman
's
commencement
!
 
<EOS>
"
do
not

me
out

"
<EOS>
My
dear
child

"
say
the
old
gentleman
,
move
by
the
warmth
of
Oliver
's
sudden
appeal
;
"
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
desert
you
,
unless
you
give
me
cause
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never

never

interpose
Oliver

<EOS>
"
I

rejoin
the

I
do

<EOS>
I

be
deceive

before

in
the
object

I
have
endeavour
to
benefit

I
feel
strongly
disposed
to
trust
you

nevertheless

I
be
more
interested
in
your

than
I

well
account

<EOS>
the
person
on

I

my

deep
in

grave

the
happiness

delight

bury
there
too

I
have
not

<EOS>
as
the
old
gentleman
say
this
in
a
low
voice

more
to
himself

remain
silent

short
time
afterwards

Oliver
sit
quite
still

say
the
old
gentleman
at
length
,
in
a
more
cheerful
tone
,
"
<EOS>
I
only
say
this
,
because
you
have
a
young
heart
;

know
that
I
have
suffer
great
pain
and
sorrow
,
you
will
be
more
careful
,
perhaps
,
not
to
wound
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
be
an
orphan

without
a
friend
in
the
world

all
the
inquiry
I
have
be
able
to
make
,
confirm
the
statement
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
hear
your
story
;
where
you
come
from
;
who
bring
you
up
;

how
you
get
into
the
company

I
find
you

the
truth

you
shall
not

"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
's
sobs
check
his
utterance
for
some
minute
;
when
he
be
on
the
point
of
beginning
to
relate
how
he
have
be

up
at
the
farm

<EOS>
Mr

smile
;

,
turn
to
Oliver
,
say
that
Mr
Grimwig
be
an
old
friend
of
his
,
and
he
must
not
mind
his
be
a
little
rough
in
his
manner

for
he
be
a
worthy
creature
at
bottom

as
he
have
reason
to
know
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
downstairs
,
sir

"
inquire
Oliver

<EOS>
"
no

"
reply
Mr

,
"
I
would
rather
you
remain
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
this
moment
,
there
walk
into
the
room
:
 
support
himself
by
a
thick
stick
:
 
<EOS>
a
stout
old
gentleman
,
rather
lame
in
one
leg
,
who
be
dress
in
a
blue
coat
,
stripe
waistcoat
,
nankeen
breech
and
gaiter
,
and
a
broad

brim
white
hat

with
the
side
turn
up
with
green

<EOS>
a
very
small
-
plaited
shirt
frill
stick
out
from
his
waistcoat
;
and
a
very
long
steel
watch
-
chain
,
with
nothing
but
a
key
at
the
end
,
dangle
loosely
below
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
end
of
his
white
neckerchief
be
twist
into
a
ball
about
the
size
of
an
orange
;
the
variety
of
shape
into
which
his
countenance
be
twist
,
defy
description
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
manner
of
screw
his
head
on
one
side
when
he
speak
;
and
of
look
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
the
same
time
:
 
which
irresistibly
remind
the
beholder
of
a
parrot
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
attitude
,
he
fix
himself
,
the
moment
he
make
his
appearance
;
and
,
hold
out
a
small
piece
of
orange
-
peel
at
arm
's
length
,
exclaim
,
in
a
growling
,
discontent
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
look
here
!
<EOS>
do
you
see
this

be
not
it
a
most
wonderful
and
extraordinary
thing
that
I
can
not

at
a
man

I
find
a
piece
of
this
poor

be
lame
with

<EOS>
this
be
the
handsome
offer
with
which
Mr
Grimwig
back
and
confirm
nearly
every
assertion
he
make
;
and
it
be
the
more
singular
in
his
case
,
because
,
even
admit
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
the
possibility
of
scientific
improvement
be
bring
to
that
pass
which
will
enable
a
gentleman
to
eat
his
own
head
in
the
event
of
his
be
so
disposed

Mr
Grimwig
's
head
be
such
a
particularly
large
one
,
that
the
most
sanguine
man
alive
could
hardly
entertain
a
hope
of
be
able
to
get
through
it
at
a
sitting
---
to
put
entirely
out
of
the
question
,
a
very
thick
coating
of
powder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
eat
my
head

repeat
Mr

strike
his
stick
upon
the
ground

<EOS>
"
hallo

<EOS>
what
be
that
!
"
<EOS>
look
at
Oliver

and
retreat
a
pace
or
two
.
   
<EOS>
"
this

recoil
a
little
more

continue
Mr

lose
all
dread
of

his
triumph
at
the
discovery
;

Mr

seem
to

something
disagreeable

now
,
the
fact
be
,
that
in
the
inmost
recess
of
his
own
heart
,
Mr
Grimwig
be
strongly
disposed
to
admit
that
Oliver
's
appearance
and
manner
be
unusually
prepossessing
;
but
he
have
a
strong
appetite
for
contradiction
,
sharpen
on
this
occasion
by
the
finding
of
the
orange
-
peel
;
and
,
inwardly
determine
that
no
man
should
dictate
to
him
whether
a
boy
be
well
-
look
or
not
,
he
have
resolve
,
from
the
first
,
to
oppose
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Brownlow
admit
that
on
no
one
point
of
inquiry
could
he
yet
return
a
satisfactory
answer
;
and
that
he
have
postpone
any
investigation
into
Oliver
's
previous
history
until
he
think
the
boy
be
strong
enough
to
hear
it
;
Mr
Grimwig
chuckle
maliciously
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
demand
,
with
a
sneer
,
whether
the
housekeeper
be
in
the
habit
of
count
the
plate
at
night
;
because
if
she
do
not
find
a
table
-
spoon
or
two
miss
some
sunshiny
morning
,
why
,
he
would
be
content
to
---
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
,
Mr
Brownlow
,
although
himself
somewhat
of
an
impetuous
gentleman
:
 
know
his
friend
's
peculiarity
,
bear
with
great
good
humour
;
as
Mr

,
at
tea
,
be
graciously
pleased
to
express
his
entire
approval

go
on
very
smoothly
;
and
Oliver
,
who
make
one
of
the
party
,
begin
to
feel
more
at
his
ease

ask
Grimwig
of
Mr

at

conclusion

It
be
worthy
of
remark

as
illustrate
the
importance
we
attach
to
our
own
judgment
,
and
<EOS>
the
pride
with
which
we
put
forth
our
most
rash
and
hasty
conclusion
,
that
,
although
Mr
Grimwig
be
not
by
any

a
bad

hearted
man
,
and
though
he
would
have
be
unfeignedly
sorry
to
see
his
respect
friend
dupe

deceive

he
really
do
most
earnestly

strongly
hope
at

moment

that
Oliver

not
come
back
.

It
grow
so
dark

that

in
the
obscure
parlour
of
a
low
public

house
,
in
the
filthiest
part
of
Little
Saffron
Hill
;
a
dark
and
gloomy
den

where
a
flare
gas

light
burn
all
day
in

winter

time

and
where
no
ray

brood
over
a
little
pewter
measure
and
a
small
glass

the
smell
of
liquor

drab

in
wink
at
his
master
with
both
eye
at
the

and
in
lick
a
large
,
fresh
cut
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
,
which
appear
to
be
the
result
of
some
recent
conflict

Mr

silence

<EOS>
whether
his
meditation
be
so
intense
as
to
be
disturb
by
the
dog

winking

or
whether
his
feeling
be
so
work
upon
by
his
reflection
that
they
require
all
the
relief
derivable
from
kick
an
unoffending
animal
to
allay
them

matter
for
argument

consideration

whatever

not

apt

Mr

have
fault
of
temper
in
common
with
his
owner
,
and
labour
,
perhaps
,
at
this
moment
,
under
a
powerful
sense
of
injury
,
make
no
more
ado

at
once
fix
his
tooth
in
one
of

have
give
in
a
hearty
shake

under

the
pewter

Mr

level
at
his
head

<EOS>
"
You

Sikes

seize
the
poker
in

deliberately
open
with

a
large
clasp

draw
from

<EOS>
the
dog
no
doubt
hear
;
because
Mr
Sikes
speak
in
the
very
harsh
key
of
a
very
harsh
voice
;
but
,
appear
to
entertain
some
unaccountable
objection
to
have
his
throat
cut
,
he
remain
where
he
be
,
and
growl
more
fiercely
than
before
:
 
at
the
same
time
grasp
the
end
of
the
poker
between
his
tooth
,
and
bite
at
it
like
a
wild
beast
.
   
<EOS>
this
resistance
only
infuriate
Mr

the
more
;
who
,
drop
on
his
knee

assail
the
animal
most
furiously

jump
from

to
right
;
snapping
,
growling

barking

thrust
and
swear
,
and
strike
and
blaspheme
;
and
the
struggle
be
reach
a
most
critical
point
for
one

other
;
when

the
door
suddenly
open

the

dart
out
:
 
leave
Bill
Sikes

shut
up

It

<EOS>
with
this
consolation
,
Mr
Sikes
appear
to
repress
a
rise
tendency
to
jealousy
,
and
,
clasp
Oliver
's
wrist
more
firmly
,
tell
him
to
step
out
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
wait
a

the

round

I

inquire
the
unsentimental
Mr

<EOS>
"
unless

you

fifty

<EOS>
the
girl
burst
into
a
laugh
;
draw
her
shawl
more
closely
round
her
;
and
they
walk
away

<EOS>
but
Oliver
feel
her
hand
tremble
,
and
,
look
up
in
her
face
as
they
pass
a
gas
-
lamp
,
see
that
it
have
turn
a
deadly
white
.
   
<EOS>
They
walk
on
,
by
little
-
frequented
and
dirty
way
,
for
a
full
half
-
hour
:
 
<EOS>
meet
very
few
people
,
and
those
appear
from
their
look
to
hold
much
the
same
position
in
society
as
Mr
Sikes
himself
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
they
turn
into
a
very
filthy
narrow
street
,
nearly
full
of
old
-
clothe
shop
;
the
dog
run
forward
,
as
if
conscious
that
there
be
no
further
occasion
for
his
keeping
on
guard
,
stop
before
the
door
of
a
shop
that
be
closed
and
apparently
untenanted
;
the
house
be
in
a
ruinous
condition
,
and
on
the
door
be
nail
a
board
,
intimate
that
it
be
to
let
:
 
which
look
as
if
it
have
hang
there
for
many
year

<EOS>
"
all
right

"
cry
Sikes
,
glance
cautiously
about
.
   
<EOS>
Nancy
stoop
below
the
shutter
,
and
Oliver
hear
the
sound
of
a
bell
.
 
<EOS>
They
cross
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
and
stand
for
a
few
moment
under
a
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
a
noise
,
as
if
a
sash
window
be
gently
raise
,
be
hear
;
and
soon
afterwards
the
door
softly
open
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
then
seize
the
terrified
boy
by
the
collar
with
very
little
ceremony
;
and
all
three
be
quickly
inside
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
the
passage
be
perfectly
dark
.
 
<EOS>
They
wait
,
while
the
person
who
have
let
them
in
,
chain
and
bar
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
anybody
here
?
"
inquire
Sikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
no

a
voice
,
which
Oliver
think
he
have
hear
before

<EOS>
"
be

"
ask
the
robber

<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
will
not
he
be
glad
to
see
you
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
style
of
this
reply
,
as
well
as
the
voice
which
deliver
it
,
seem
familiar
to
Oliver
's
ear
:
 
but
it
be
impossible
to
distinguish
even
the
form
of
the
speaker
in
the
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
's
have
a
glim
,

Sikes

still
a
moment

the
voice
.
<EOS>
the
recede
footstep
of
the
speaker
be
hear
;
and
,
in
another
minute
,
the
form
of
Mr
John
Dawkins
,
otherwise
the
Artful
Dodger
,
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
bear
in
his
right
hand
a
tallow
candle
stick
in
the
end
of
a
cleft
stick
.
   
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
do
not
stop
to
bestow
any
other
mark
of
recognition
upon
Oliver
than
a
humourous
grin
;
but
,
turn
away
,
beckon
the
visitor
to
follow
him
down
a
flight
of
stair
.
<EOS>
They
cross
an
empty
kitchen
;
and
,
open
the
door
of
a
low
earthy
-
smell
room
,
which
seem
to
have
be
build
in
a
small
back

yard

a
shout
of
laughter

<EOS>
hold

while
I
laugh
it
out

"
   
<EOS>
with
this
irrepressible
ebullition
of
mirth
,
Master
Bates
lay
himself
flat
on
the
floor
:
and
kick
convulsively
for
five
minute
,
in
an
ectasy
of
facetious
joy
.
 
<EOS>
then
jump
to
his
foot
,
he
snatch
the
cleft
stick
from
the
Dodger
;
and
,
advance
to
Oliver

view
him
round
and
round
;
while
the
Jew
,
take
off
his
nightcap
,
make
a
great
number
of
low
bow

bewilder
boy

the

and
seldom

to
merriment
when
it
interfere
with
business

rifle
Oliver

pocket
with
steady
assiduity

<EOS>
"

Charley

put
the
light
so
close
to

on

his
,
Master

roar
again

so
loud
,
that
Fagin

even
the
Dodger
smile
;
but
as
the
Artful
draw
forth
the
five

pound
note
at
that
instant

it
be
doubtful
whether

<EOS>
Oliver

from

with
this

,
Mr

pluck
the
note
from
between
the

Nancy

very
loud

"
come

<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
that

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
be
sufficiently
well
acquaint
with
the
manner
and
custom
of
that
particular
specie
of
humanity
to
which
Nancy
belong
,
to
feel
tolerably
certain
that
it
would
be
rather
unsafe
to
prolong
any
conversation
with
her
,
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
view
of
divert
the
attention
of
the
company
,
he
turn
to
Oliver
.
   
<EOS>
"
so
you
want
to
get
away
,
my
dear
,
do
you
?
"
say
the
Jew
,
take
up
a
jagged
and
knot
club
which

a
corner
of
the
fireplace
;
"
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
Oliver
make
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
watch
the
Jew
's
motion
,
and
breathe
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
want
to
get
assistance
;
call
for
the
police
;
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
sneer
the
Jew

catch
the
boy
by
the
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
cure
you
of
that
,
my
young
master

"
   
<EOS>
the
Jew
inflict
a
smart
blow
on
Oliver
's
shoulder
with
the
club
;
and
be
raise
it
for
a
second
,
when
the
girl
,
rush
forward
,
wrest
it
from
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
fling
it
into
the
fire
,
with
a
force
that
bring
some
of
the
glowing
coal
whirl
out
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
stand
by

see
it
do

cry
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
the

what
more
would
you
have

let

I
shall
put
that
mark

some

will
bring

to
the
gallow
before
my

"
   
<EOS>
the
girl
stamp
her
foot
violently
on
the
floor
as
she
vent
this
threat
;
and
with
her
lip
compress
,
and
her
hand
clench
,
look
alternately
at
the
Jew
and
the
other
robber
:
<EOS>
her
face
quite
colourless
from
the
passion
of
rage
into
which
she
have
gradually
work
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
Nancy
!
"
say
the
Jew
,
in
a
soothing
tone
;
after
a
pause
,
during
which
he
and
Mr
Sikes
have
stare
at
one
another
in
a
disconcerted
manner
;
"
you
,
---
you
be
more
clever
than
ever

I

You
will
be
the
bad
for
it

if
I
do

so
I
tell
you
in
good
time
to
keep
clear
of
me

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
about
a
roused
woman
:
especially
if
she
add
to
all
her
other
strong
passion
,
the
fierce
impulse
of
recklessness
and
despair
;
which
few
man
like
to
provoke
.
<EOS>
the
Jew
see
that
it
would
be
hopeless
to
affect
any
further
mistake
regard
the
reality
of
Miss
Nancy
's
rage
;
and
,
shrink
involuntarily
back
a
few
pace
,
cast
a
glance
,
half
imploring
and
half
cowardly
,
at
Sikes
:
as
if
to
hint
that
he
be
the
fit
person
to
pursue
the
dialogue
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
,
thus
mutely
appeal
to
;
and
possibly
feel
his
personal
pride
and
influence
interested
in
the
immediate
reduction
of
Miss
Nancy
to
reason
;
give
utterance
to
about
a
couple
of
score
of
curse
and
threat
,
the
rapid
production
of
which
reflect
great
credit
on
the
fertility
of
his
invention
.
<EOS>
as
they
produce
no
visible
effect
on
the
object
against
whom
they
be
discharge
,
however
,
he
resort
to
more
tangible
argument
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
this
?
"
say
Sikes
;
back
the
inquiry
with
a
very
common
imprecation
concern
the
most
beautiful
of
human
feature
:
which
,
if
it
be
hear
above
,
only
once
out
of
every
fifty
thousand
time
that
it
be
uttered
below

would
render
blindness
as
common
a
disorder
as
measle
:

what

burn
my

do
you
know

"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
I
know
all
about
it

"
reply
the
girl
,
laugh
hysterically
;
and
shake
her
head
from
side
to
side
,
with
a
poor
assumption
of
indifference
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
keep
quiet
,
"
rejoin
Sikes
,
with
a
growl
like
that
he
be
accustomed
to
use
when
address
his
dog
,
"
or
I
will
quiet
you
for
a
good
long
time

"
   
<EOS>
the
girl
laugh
again
:
even
less
composedly
than
before
;
and
,
dart
a
hasty
look
at
Sikes
,
turn
her
face
aside
,

bite
her
lip

the
blood
come

the
Jew
appeal
to
him
in
a
remonstratory
tone

and
motion
towards
the
boy

who
be
eagerly
attentive
to
all

return
the

not

pour
out
the
word

continuous
and
vehement
scream

goad
by
these
reproach

a
mischief
bad
than

if
you

much
more

the
girl
say
nothing
more
;
but
,
tear
her
hair
and
dress
in
a
transport
of
passion
,
make
such
a
rush
at
the
Jew

would

signal
mark

revenge

She

uncommon
strong

the
Jew
wipe
his
forehead
:
and
smile
,
as
if
it
be
a
relief
to
have
the
disturbance
over
;
but
neither
he

nor
Sikes
,
nor
the
dog

to
consider
it
in
any

"
It

Charley

the
Jew

reciprocate
the
grin
with
which
Charley

the
question

<EOS>
Master
Bates

apparently
much
delighted
with
his
commission

take
the
cleft

lead
Oliver
into
an
adjacent
kitchen

where
there
be
two

three
of

he
have
sleep
before

here

with
many
uncontrollable
burst
of
laughter

he
produce
the
identical
old
suit
of
clothe
which
Oliver
have
so
much
congratulate
himself
upon
leave
off

the
accidental
display

roll
up

new
clothe
under

depart
from
the
room

leave
Oliver
in

dark

the
noise

opportunely
arrive

throw
water
over
her

other
feminine
office

Chapter
17
.
<EOS>
Oliver
's
destiny
continue
unpropitious
,
bring
a
great
man
to
London
to
injure
his
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
custom
on
the
stage
,
in
all
good
murderous
melodrama
,
to
present
the
tragic
and
the
comic
scene
,
in
as
regular
alternation
,
as
the
layer
of
red
and
white
in
a
side
of
streaky
bacon
.
 
<EOS>
the
hero
sink
upon
his
straw
bed
,
weigh
down
by
fetter
and
misfortune
;
in
the
next
scene
,
his
faithful
but
unconscious
squire
regale
the
audience
with
a
comic
song
.
 
<EOS>
We
behold
,
with
throbbing
bosom
,
the
heroine
in
the
grasp
of
a
proud
and
ruthless
baron
:
her
virtue
and
her
life
alike
in
danger
,
draw
forth
her
dagger
to
preserve
the
one
at
the
cost
of
the
other
;
and
just
as
our
expectation
be
work
up
to
the
high
pitch
,
a
whistle
be
hear
,
and
we
be
straightway
transported
to
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
;
where
a
grey
-
head
seneschal
sing
a
funny
chorus
with
a
funny
body
of
vassal
,
who
be
free
of
all
sort
of
place
,
from
church
vault
to
palace
,
and
roam
about
in
company
,
carol
perpetually
.
   
<EOS>
such
change
appear
absurd
;
but
they
be
not
so
unnatural
as
they
would
seem
at
first
sight
.
 
<EOS>
the
transition
in
real
life
from
well
-
spread
board
to
death
-
bed
,
and
from
mourning
-
weed
to
holiday
garment
,
be
not
a
whit
less
startling
;
only
,
there
,
we
be
busy
actor
,
instead
of
passive
looker
-
on
,
which
make
a
vast
difference
.
 
<EOS>
the
actor
in
the
mimic
life
of
the
theatre
,
be
blind
to
violent
transition
and
abrupt
impulse
of
passion
or
feeling
,
which
,
present
before
the
eye
of
mere
spectator
,
be
at
once
condemn
as
outrageous
and
preposterous
.
   
<EOS>
as
sudden
shifting
of
the
scene
,
and
rapid
change
of
time
and
place
,
be
not
only
sanction
in
book
by
long
usage
,
but
be
by
many
consider
as
the
great
art
of
authorship
:
an
author
's
skill
in
his
craft
be
,
by
such
critic
,
chiefly
estimate
with
relation
to
the
dilemma
in
which
he
leave
his
character
at
the
end
of
every
chapter
:
this
brief
introduction
to
the
present
one
may
perhaps
be
deem
unnecessary
.
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
let
it
be
consider
a
delicate
intimation
on
the
part
of
the
historian
that
he
be
go
back
to
the
town
in
which
Oliver
Twist
be
bear
;
the
reader
take
it
for
grant
that
there
be
good
and
substantial
reason
for
make
the
journey

or
he

high

but
this
morning
it
be
high

<EOS>
there
be
an
abstraction
in
his
eye

an
elevation
in
his
air
,
which
may
have
warn
an
observant
stranger
that
thought
be
pass
in
the
beadle

mind
,
too
great
for
utterance

<EOS>
Mr

not

converse
with
the
small
shopkeeper

other
who
speak
to
him
,
deferentially

along

<EOS>
He

return
their
salutation
with

Mr
Grimwig
aside
to
his
friend
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
he
be

<EOS>
a
beadle
all
over
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
gently
shake
his
head
to
impose
silence
on
his
friend
,
and
resume
:
   
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
where
this
poor
boy
be
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
more
than
nobody
,
"
reply
Mr
Bumble
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
what
do
you
know
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
the
old
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
speak
out
,
my
friend
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
know
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
happen
to
know
any
good
of
him
,
do
you
?
"
say
Mr
Grimwig
,
caustically
;
after
an
attentive
perusal
of
Mr
Bumble
's
feature
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
catch
at
the
inquiry
very
quickly
,
shake
his
head
with
portentous
solemnity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
?
"
say
Mr
Grimwig
,
look
triumphantly
at
Mr
Brownlow
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
look
apprehensively
at
Mr
Bumble
's
purse
-
up
countenance
;
and
request
him
to
communicate
what
he
know
regard
Oliver
,
in
as
few
word
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
put
down
his
hat
;
unbutton
his
coat
;
fold
his
arm
;
incline
his
head
in
a
retrospective
manner
;
and
,
after
a
few
moment
'
reflection
,
commence
his
story
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
if
give
in
the
beadle
's
word
:
 
occupy
,
as
it
do
,
some
twenty
minute
in
the
telling
;
but
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
be
,
that
Oliver
be
a
foundling
,
bear
of
low
and
vicious
parent
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
,
from
his
birth
,
display
no
well
quality
than
treachery
,
ingratitude
,
and
malice
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
terminate
his
brief
career
in
the
place
of
his
birth
,
by
make
a
sanguinary
and
cowardly
attack
on
an
unoffending
lad
,
and
run
away
in
the
night
-
time
from
his
master
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
in
proof
of
his
really
be
the
person
he
represent
himself
,
Mr
Bumble
lay
upon
the
table
the
paper
he
have
bring
to
town
.
<EOS>
fold
his
arm
again
,
he
then
await
Mr
Brownlow
's
observation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
it
be
all
too
true
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
sorrowfully
,
after
look
over
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
not
much
for
your
intelligence
;
but
I
would
gladly
have
give
you
treble
the
money
,
if
it
have
be
favourable
to
the
boy
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
improbable
that
if
Mr
Bumble
have
be
possess
of
this
information
at
an
early
period
of
the
interview
,
he
may
have
impart
a
very
different
colouring
to
his
little
history
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
to
do
it
now
,
however
;
so
he
shake
his
head
gravely
,
and
,
pocket
the
five
guinea
,
withdraw
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Brownlow
pace
the
room
to
and
fro
for
some
minute
;
evidently
so
much
disturb
by
the
beadle
's
tale
,
that
even
Mr
Grimwig
forbore
to
vex
him
further
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
he
stop
,
and
ring
the
bell
violently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bedwin
,
"
say
Mr
Brownlow
,
when
the
housekeeper
appear
;
"
<EOS>
that

Oliver

an
imposter

"
It

<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
We
have
just

Mr

"
I
know
it
all
along

why
do
not
you
take
my
advise
in
the
beginning
;
you
would

a
fever

I

He

Bah

<EOS>
and
Mr

poke
the
fire
with
a
flourish
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
dear

grateful

gentle

retort
Mrs

indignantly

<EOS>
"
I
know

have
do

people

should
not

anything
about

<EOS>
that
be
my
opinion

"
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
hard
hit
at
Mr
Grimwig
,
who
be
a
bachelor

<EOS>
as
it
extort
nothing
from
that

a
smile

the
old

toss
her
head

and
smooth
down
her
apron
preparatory
to
another
speech

when

"
Silence

the

"
never

I

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
sad
heart
at
Mr
Brownlow
's
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
's
heart
sink
within
him
,
when
he
think
of
his
good
friend
;
it
be
well
for
him
that
he
could
not

or
it

have
break
outright

Chapter
08
.
<EOS>
how
Oliver
pass
his
time
in
the
improve
society
of
his
reputable
friend
.
 
<EOS>
about
noon
next
day
,
when
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
have
go
out
to
pursue
their
customary
avocation
,
Mr
Fagin
take
the
opportunity
of
read
Oliver
a
long
lecture
on
the
cry
sin
of
ingratitude
;
of
which
he
clearly
demonstrate
he
have
be
guilty
,
to
no
ordinary
extent
,
in
wilfully
absent
himself
from
the
society
of
his
anxious
friend
;
and
,
still
more
,
in
endeavour
to
escape
from
them
after
so
much
trouble
and
expense
have
be
incur
in
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
lay
great
stress
on
the
fact
of
his
have
take
Oliver
in
,
and
cherish
him
,
when
,
without
his
timely
aid
,
he
may
have
perish
with
hunger
;
and
he
relate
the
dismal
and
affect
history
of
a
young
lad
whom
,
in
his
philanthropy
,
he
have
succour
under
parallel
circumstance
,
but
who
,
prove
unworthy
of
his
confidence
and
evince
a
desire
to
communicate
with
the
police
,
have
unfortunately
come
to
be
hang
at
the
Old
Bailey
one
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
do
not
seek
to
conceal
his
share
in
the
catastrophe
,
but
lament
with
tear
in
his
eye
that
the
wrong
-
head
and
treacherous
behaviour
of
the
young
person
in
question
,
have
render
it
necessary
that
he
should
become
the
victim
of
certain
evidence
for
the
crown
:
which
,
if
it
be
not
precisely
true
,
be
indispensably
necessary
for
the
safety
of
him
(
Mr
Fagin
)
and
a
few
select
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fagin
conclude
by
draw
a
rather
disagreeable
picture
of
the
discomfort
of
hanging
;
and
,
with
great
friendliness
and
politeness
of
manner
,
express
his
anxious
hope
that
he
may
never
be
oblige
to
submit
Oliver
Twist
to
that
unpleasant
operation
.
   
<EOS>
Little
Oliver
's
blood
run
cold
,
as
he
listen
to
the
Jew
's
word
,
and
imperfectly
comprehend
the
dark
threat
convey
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
possible
even
for
justice
itself
to
confound
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
when
they
be
in
accidental
companionship
,
he
know
already
;
and
that
deeply
-
lay
plan
for
the
destruction
of
inconveniently
know
or
over
-
communicative
person
,
have
be
really
devise
and
carry
out
by
the
Jew
on
more
occasion
than
one
,
he
think
by
no
means
unlikely
,
when
he
recollect
the
general
nature
of
the
altercation
between
that
gentleman
and
Mr
Sikes
:
which
seem
to
bear
reference
to
some
foregone
conspiracy
of
the
kind
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
glance
timidly
up
,
and
meet
the
Jew
's
searching
look
,
he
feel
that
his
pale
face
and
tremble
limb
be
neither
unnoticed
nor
unrelished
by
that
wary
old
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
the
Jew
,
smile
hideously
,
pat
Oliver
on
the
head
,
and
say
,
that
if
he
keep
himself
quiet
,
and
apply
himself
to
business
,
he
see
they
would
be
very
good
friend
yet
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
take
his
hat
,
and
cover
himself
with
an
old
patch
great
-
coat
,
he
go
out
,
and
lock
the
room
-
door
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
and
so
Oliver
remain
all
that
day
,
and
for
the
great
part
of
many
subsequent
day
,
see
nobody
,
between
early
morning
and
midnight
,
and
leave
during
the
long
hour
to
commune
with
his
own
thought
.
 
<EOS>
which
,
never
fail
to
revert
to
his
kind
friend
,
and
the
opinion
they
must
long
ago
have
form
of
him
,
be
sad
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
after
the
lapse
of
a
week
or
so
,
the
Jew
leave
the
room
-
door
unlock
;
and
he
be
at
liberty
to
wander
about
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
dirty
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
upstairs
have
great
high
wooden
chimney
-
piece
and
large
door
,
with
panelled
wall
and
cornice
to
the
ceiling
;
which
,
although
they
be
black
with
neglect
and
dust
,
be
ornament
in
various
way
.
 
<EOS>
from
all
of
these
token
Oliver
conclude
that
a
long
time
ago
,
before
the
old
Jew
be
bear
,
it
have
belong
to
well
people
,
and
have
perhaps
be
quite
gay
and
handsome
:
 
dismal
and
dreary
as
it
look
now
.
   
<EOS>
spider
have
build
their
webs
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
and
ceiling
;
and
sometimes
,
when
Oliver
walk
softly
into
a
room
,
the
mouse
would
scamper
across
the
floor
,
and
run
back
terrified
to
their
hole
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
exception
,
there
be
neither
sight
nor
sound
of
any
live
thing
;
and
often
,
when
it
grow
dark
,
and
he
be
tired
of
wander
from
room
to
room
,
he
would
crouch
in
the
corner
of
the
passage
by
the
street
-
door
,
to
be
as
near
live
people
as
he
could
;
and
would
remain
there
,
listen
and
count
the
hour
,
until
the
Jew
or
the
boy
return
.
   
<EOS>
in
all
the
room
,
the
mouldering
shutter
be
fast
closed
:
 
<EOS>
the
bar
which
hold
them
be
screw
tight
into
the
wood
;
the
only
light
which
be
admit
,
steal
its
way
through
round
hole
at
the
top
:
which
make
the
room
more
gloomy
,
and
fill
them
with
strange
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
back
-
garret
window
with
rusty
bar
outside
,
which
have
no
shutter
;
and
out
of
this
,
Oliver
often
gaze
with
a
melancholy
face
for
hour
together
;
but
nothing
be
to
be
descry
from
it
but
a
confused
and
crowded
mass
of
housetop
,
blacken
chimney
,
and
gable
-
end
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
indeed
,
a
grizzly
head
may
be
see
,
peer
over
the
parapet
-
wall
of
a
distant
house
;
but
it
be
quickly
withdraw
again
;
and
as
the
window
of
Oliver
's
observatory
be
nail
down
,
and
dim
with
the
rain
and
smoke
of
year
,
it
be
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
make
out
the
form
of
the
different
object
beyond
,
without
make
any
attempt
to
be
see
or
hear
,
---
which
he
have
as
much
chance
of
be
,
as
if
he
have
live
inside
the
ball
of
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
   
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
the
Dodger
and
Master
Bates
be
engage
out
that
evening
,
the
first
-
name
young
gentleman
take
it
into
his
head
to
evince
some
anxiety
regard
the
decoration
of
his
person
(
to
do
him
justice
,
this
be
by
no
means
an
habitual
weakness
with
him
)
;
and
,
with
this
end
and
aim
,
he
condescendingly
command
Oliver
to
assist
him
in
his
toilet
,
straightway
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
be
but
too
glad
to
make
himself
useful
;
too
happy
to
have
some
face
,
however
bad
,
to
look
upon
;
too
desirous
to
conciliate
those
about
him
when
he
could
honestly
do
so
;
to
throw
any
objection
in
the
way
of
this
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
at
once
express
his
readiness
;
and
,
kneel
on
the
floor
,
while
the
Dodger
sit
upon
the
table
so
that
he
could
take
his
foot
in
his
lap
,
he
apply
himself
to
a
process
which
Mr
Dawkins
designate
as
"
japan
his
trotter
-
case
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
phrase
,
render
into
plain
English
,
signifieth
,
clean
his
boot
.
   
<EOS>
whether
it
be
the
sense
of
freedom
and
independence
which
a
rational
animal
may
be
suppose
to
feel
when
he
sit
on
a
table
in
an
easy
attitude
smoke
a
pipe
,
swinge
one
leg
carelessly
to
and
fro
,
and
have
his
boot
clean
all
the
time
,
without
even
the
past
trouble
of
have
take
them
off
,
or
the
prospective
misery
of
put
them
on
,
to
disturb
his
reflection
;
or
whether
it
be
the
goodness
of
the
tobacco
that
soothe
the
feeling
of
the
Dodger
,
or
the
mildness
of
the
beer
that
mollify
his
thought
;
he
be
evidently
tincture
,
for
the
nonce
,
with
a
spice
of
romance
and
enthusiasm
,
foreign
to
his
general
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
down
on
Oliver
,
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
,
for
a
brief
space
;
and
then
,
raise
his
head
,
and
heave
a
gentle
sign
,
say
,
half
in
abstraction
,
and
half
to
Master
Bates
:
   
<EOS>
"
what
a
pity
it
be
he
be
not
a
prig
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Master
Charles
Bates
;
"
he
do
not
know
what
be
good
for
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
Dodger
sigh
again
,
and
resume
his
pipe
:
as
do
Charley
Bates
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
smoke
,
for
some
second
,
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
do
not
even
know
what
a
prig
be
?
"
say
the
Dodger

glowing
description

the
numerous
pleasure
incidental
to

life
they
lead
,
intersperse
with
a
variety
of
hint
to
Oliver
that
the
good
thing
he
could
do
,
would
be
to
secure
Fagin

favour
without
more
delay

by
the
mean

rub
his
hand
gleefully
together

as
he
corroborate
the
Dodger

reasoning
in
these
term
;
and
chuckle
with
delight
at
his
pupil
's
proficiency

<EOS>
the
conversation
proceed
no
farther
at
this
time
,
for
the
Jew
have
return
home
accompany
by
Miss
Betsy
,
and
a
gentleman
whom
Oliver
have
never
see
before
,
but
who
be
accost
by
the
Dodger
as
Tom
Chitling
;
and
who
,
have
linger
on
the
stair
to
exchange
a
few
gallantry
with
the
lady
,
now
make
his
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Chitling
be
old
in
year
than
the
Dodger
:
have
perhaps
number
eighteen
winter
;
but
there
be
a
degree
of
deference
in
his
deportment
towards
that
young
gentleman
which
seem
to
indicate
that
he
feel
himself
conscious
of
a
slight
inferiority
in
point
of
genius
and
professional
aquirement
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
small
twinkle
eye
,
and
a
pock
-
mark
face
;
wear
a
fur
cap
,
a
dark
corduroy
jacket
,
greasy
fustian
trouser
,
and
an
apron
.
 
<EOS>
His
wardrobe
be
,
in
truth
,
rather
out
of
repair
;
but
he
excuse
himself
to
the
company
by
state
that
his
"
time
"
be
only
out
an
hour
before
;
and
that
,
in
consequence
of
have
wear
the
regimental
for
six
week
past
,
he
have
not
be
able
to
bestow
any
attention
on
his
private
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chitling
add
,
with
strong
mark
of
irritation
,
that
the
new
way
of
fumigate
clothe
up
yonder
be
infernal
unconstitutional
,
for
it
burn
hole
in
them
,
and
there
be
no
remedy
against
the
County
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
remark
he
consider
to
apply
to
the
regulation
mode
of
cut
the
hair
:
which
he
hold
to
be
decidedly
unlawful
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chitling
wind
up
his
observation
by
state
that
he
have
not
touch
a
drop
of
anything
for
forty
-
two
moral
long
hard
-
work
day
;
and
that
he
"
wish
he
may
be
bust
if
he
warn't
as
dry
as

"
   
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
think
the
gentleman
have
come
from

Oliver

"
inquire
the
Jew
,
with
a
grin
,
as
the
other
boy
put
a
bottle
of
spirit
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I

do
not

Oliver

<EOS>
"
who
be
that

<EOS>
inquire
Tom
Chitling

cast
a
contemptuous
look
at
Oliver

<EOS>
"
a

the
Jew

<EOS>
"
He

luck

the
young
man
,
with
a
meaning
look

Fagin

<EOS>
"
never
mind
where
I
come
from

you
will
find
your
way
there
,
soon
enough

I
will
bet
a
crown

<EOS>
at
this
sally
,
the
boy
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
more
joke
on
the
same
subject
,
they
exchange
a
few
short
whisper
with
Fagin
;
and
withdraw
.
   
<EOS>
after
some
word
apart
between
the
last
comer
and
Fagin
,
they
draw
their
chair
towards
the
fire
;
and
the
Jew
,
tell
Oliver
to
come
and
sit
by
him
,
lead
the
conversation
to
the
topic
most
calculate
to
interest
his
hearer
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
,
the
great
advantage
of
the
trade
,
the
proficiency
of
the
Dodger
,
the
amiability
of
Charley
Bates
,
and
the
liberality
of
the
Jew
himself
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
these
subject
display
sign
of
be
thoroughly
exhausted
;
and
Mr
Chitling
do
the
same
:
 
for
the
house
of
correction
become
fatiguing
after
a
week
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Betsy
accordingly
withdraw
;
and
leave
the
party
to
their
repose
.
   
<EOS>
from
this
day
,
Oliver
be
seldom
leave
alone
;
but
be
place
in
almost
constant
communication
with
the
two
boy
,
who
play
the
old
game
with
the
Jew
every
day
:
whether
for
their
own
improvement
or
Oliver
's
,
Mr
Fagin
best
know
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
the
old
man
would
tell
them
story
of
robbery
he
have
commit
in
his
young
day
:
 
mix
up
with
so
much
that
be
droll
and
curious
,
that
Oliver
could
not
help
laugh
heartily
,
and
show
that
he
be
amuse
in
spite
of
all
his
well
feeling
.
   
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
wily
old
Jew
have
the
boy
in
his
toil
.
 
<EOS>
have
prepare
his
mind
,
by
solitude
and
gloom
,
to
prefer
any
society
to
the
companionship
of
his
own
sad
thought
in
such
a
dreary
place

he
be
now
slowly
instill
into
his
soul
the
poison
which
he

it

lie
thick
upon
the
stone
,
and
a
black
mist
hang
over
the
street
;
the
rain
fall
sluggishly
down
,
and
everything
feel
cold
and
clammy
to
the
touch
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
just
the
night
when
it
befit
such
a
being
as
the
Jew
to
be
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
glide
stealthily
along
,
creep
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
wall
and
doorway
,
the
hideous
old
man
seem
like
some
loathsome
reptile
,
engender
in
the
slime
and
darkness
through
which
he
move
:
crawl
forth
,
by
night
,
in
search
of
some
rich
offal
for
a
meal
.
   
<EOS>
He
keep
on
his
course
,
through
many
winding
and
narrow
way
,
until
he
reach
Bethnal
Green
;
then
,
turn
suddenly
off
to
the
left
,
he
soon
become
involved
in
a
maze
of
the
mean
and
dirty
street
which
abound
in
that
close
and
densely
-
populate
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
the
Jew
be
evidently
too
familiar
with
the
ground
he
traverse
to
be
at
all
bewilder
,
either
by
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
or
the
intricacy
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
hurry
through
several
alley
and
street
,
and
at
length
turn
into
one
,
light
only
by
a
single
lamp
at
the
farther
end
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
door
of
a
house
in
this
street
,
he
knock
;
have
exchange
a
few
muttered
word
with
the
person
who
open
it
,
he
walk
upstairs
.
   
<EOS>
a
dog
growl
as
he
touch
the
handle
of
a
room
-
door
;
and
a
man
's
voice
demand
who
be
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
me
,
Bill
;
only
me
,
my
dear

"
say
the
Jew
look
in

<EOS>
"

Sikes

<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
apparently
,
the
dog
have
be
somewhat
deceive
by
Mr
Fagin
's
outer
garment
;
for
as
the
Jew
unbutton
it
,
and
throw
it
over
the
back
of
a
chair
,
he
retire
to
the
corner
from
which
he
have
rise
:
 
wag
his
tail
as
he
go
,
to
show
that
he
be
as
well
satisfied
as
it
be
in
his
nature
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
well

Sikes

<EOS>
"
well

reply
the
Jew

<EOS>
---
"
ah

Nancy

"
   
<EOS>
the
latter
recognition
be
utter
with
just
enough
of
embarrassment
to
imply
a
doubt
of
its
reception
;
for
Mr
Fagin
and
his
young
friend
have
not
meet
,
since
she
have
interfere
in
behalf
of
Oliver

<EOS>
all
doubt
upon
the
subject
,
if
he
have
any
,
be
speedily
remove
by
the
young
lady
's
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
her
foot
off
the
fender
,
push
back
her
chair
,
and
bade
Fagin
draw
up
his
,
without
say
more
about
it
:
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
a
cold
night
,
and
no
mistake
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
cold

Nancy
dear

say
the
Jew
,
as
he
warm
his
skinny
hand
over
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>

It

right
through

the
old

his

"
It

It
be
enough
to
turn
a
man
ill
,
to
see
his
lean
old
carcase
shiver
in
that
way
,
like
a
ugly
ghost

from

<EOS>
Nancy
quickly
bring
a
bottle
from
a
cupboard

in
which
there
be
many
:
 
which
,
to
judge
from
the
diversity
of
their
appearance
,
be
fill
with
several
kind
of
liquid

<EOS>
Sikes
pour
out
a
glass
of
brandy

bade
the

drink
it
off

<EOS>
"

the

put
down
the

Mr

seize
the
glass
,

throw
the
remainder
of
its
content
into
the
ashe
:
as
a
preparatory
ceremony
to
fill
it
again
for
himself
:
 
which
he
do
at
once

<EOS>
the
Jew
glance
round
the
room
,
as
his
companion
toss
down
the
second
glassful
;
not
in
curiousity
,
for
he
have
see
it
often
before
;
but
in
a
restless
and
suspicious
manner
habitual
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
meanly
furnished
apartment
,
with
nothing

the
content
of
the
closet
to
induce
the
belief
that
its
occupier

anything

a
working
man
;

with
no
more
suspicious

display
to

two

<EOS>
the
Jew
seem
much
vex
by
Oliver
's
not
express
any
great
curiosity
on
the
subject
;
but
the
truth
be
,
that
,
although
Oliver
feel
very
anxious
,
he
be
too
much
confuse
by
the
earnest
cunning
of
Fagin
's
look
,
and
his
own
speculation
,
to
make
any
further
inquiry
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
other
opportunity
:
 
for
the
Jew
remain
very
surly
and
silent
till
night
:
 
when
he
prepare
to
go
abroad

<EOS>
"
You

burn

reply
Oliver
,
softly
.
   
<EOS>
the
Jew
walk
to
the
door
:
look
over
his
shoulder
at
the
boy
as
he
go
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
stop
,
he
call
him
by
his
name
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
look
up
;
the
Jew
,
point
to
the
candle
,
motion
him
to
light
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
;
and
,
as
he
place
the
candlestick
upon
the
table
,
see
that
the
Jew
be
gaze
fixedly
at
him
,
with
lower
and
contract
brow
,
from
the
dark
end
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
take

Oliver
!
<EOS>
take
heed

"
say
the
old
man
,
shake
his
right
hand
before
him
in
a
warning
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
rough
man
,
and
think
nothing
of
blood
when
his
own
be
up

<EOS>
whatever
fall
out
,
say
nothing
;
and
do
what
he
bid
you

<EOS>
mind
!
"
 
<EOS>
place
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
,
he
suffer
his
feature
gradually
to
resolve
themselves
into
a
ghastly
grin
,
and
,
nod
his
head
,
leave
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
lean
his
head
upon
his
hand
when
the
old
man
disappear
,
and
ponder
,
with
a
tremble
heart
,
on
the
word
he
have
just
hear
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
he
think
of
the
Jew
's
admonition
,
the
more
he
be
at
a
loss
to
divine
its
real
purpose
and
meaning
.
   
<EOS>
He
could
think
of
no
bad
object
to
be
attain
by
send
him
to
Sikes
,
which
would
not
be
equally
well
answer
by
his
remain
with
Fagin
;
and
after
meditate
for
a
long
time
,
conclude
that
he
have
be
select
to
perform
some
ordinary
menial
office
for
the
housebreaker
,
until
another
boy
,
better
suited
for
his
purpose
could
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
too
well
accustomed
to
suffering
,
and
have
suffer
too
much
where
he
be
,
to
bewail
the
prospect
of
change
very
severely
.
 
<EOS>
He
remain
lose
in
thought
for
some
minute
;
and
then
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
snuff
the
candle
,
and
,
take
up
the
book
which
the
Jew
have
leave
with
him
,
begin
to
read
.
   
<EOS>
He
turn
over
the
leave
.
 
<EOS>
carelessly
at
first
;
but
,
light
on
a
passage
which
attract
his
attention
,
he
soon
become
intent
upon
the
volume
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
history
of
the
life
and
trial
of
great
criminal
;
and
the
page
be
soil
and
thumb
with
use
.
<EOS>
here
,
he
read
of
dreadful
crime
that
make
the
blood
run
cold
;
of
secret
murder
that
have
be
commit
by
the
lonely
wayside
;
of
body
hide
from
the
eye
of
man
in
deep
pit
and
well
:
which
would
not
keep
them
down
,
deep
as
they
be
,
but
have
yield
them
up
at
last
,
after
many
year
,
and
so
madden
the
murderer
with
the
sight
,
that
in
their
horror
they
have
confess
their
guilt
,
and
yell
for
the
gibbet
to
end
their
agony
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
too
,
he
read
of
man
who
,
lie
in
their
bed
at
dead
of
night
,
have
be
tempt
(
so
they
say
)
and
lead
on
,
by
their
own
bad
thought
,
to
such
dreadful
bloodshed
as
it
make
the
flesh
creep
,
and
the
limb
quail
,
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
the
terrible
description
be
so
real
and
vivid
,
that
the
sallow
page
seem
to
turn
red
with
gore
;
and
the
word
upon
them
,
to
be
sound
in
his
ear
,
as
if
they
be
whisper
,
in
hollow
murmer
,
by
the
spirit
of
the
dead
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
paroxysm
of
fear
,
the
boy
close
the
book
,
and
thrust
it
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
fall
upon
his
knee
,
he
pray
Heaven
to
spare
him
from
such
deed
;
and
rather
to
will
that
he
should
die
at
once
,
than
be
reserve
for
crime
,
so
fearful
and
appaling
.
<EOS>
by
degree
,
he
grow
more
calm
,
and
besought
,
in
a
low
and
broken
voice
,
that
he
may
be
rescue
from
his
present
danger
;
and
that
if
any
aid
be
to
be
raise
up
for
a
poor
outcast
boy
who
have
never
know
the
love
of
friend
or
kindre
,
it
may
come
to
him
now
,
when
,
desolate
and
desert
,
he
stand
alone
in
the
midst
of
wickedness
and
guilt
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
conclude
his
prayer
,
but
still
remain
with
his
head
bury
in
his
hand
,
when
a
rustle
noise
arouse
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
start
up
,
and
catch
sight
of
a
figure
stand
by
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me

<EOS>

reply
a
tremulous
voice
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
raise
the
candle
above
his
head
:
and
look
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Nancy

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
Oliver
see
that
she
be
very
pale

and
gently
inquire
if
she
be
ill
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
throw
herself
into
a
chair
,
with
her
back
towards
him
:
 
and
wring
her
hand
;
but
make
no

.
   
<EOS>
"
God

me
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
after
a
while
,
"
I

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
She
rock
herself
to
and
fro
;
catch
her
throat
;
and
,
utter
a
gurgling
sound
,
gasp
for
breath
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nancy

"
<EOS>
cry
Oliver
,
"
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
girl
beat
her
hand
upon
her
knee
,
and
her
foot
upon
the
ground
;
and
,
suddenly
stop
,
draw
her
shawl
close
round
her
:
and
shiver
with
cold
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
stir
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
draw
her
chair
close
to
it
,
she
sit
there
,
for
a
little
time
,
without
speak
;
but
at
length
she
raise
her
head
,
and
look
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what

over
me
sometimes

say
she
,
affect
to
busy
herself
in
arrange
her
dress
;

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
what

ask
Oliver

<EOS>
"
what

echo
the
girl
,
raise
her
eye
,
and
avert
them
again
,
the
moment
they
encounter
the
boy
's
face

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I

Oliver

for

Oliver
could
see
that
he
have
some
power
over
the
girl
's
well
feeling
,
and
,
for
an
instant
,
think
of
appeal
to
her
compassion
for
his
helpless
state
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
then
,
the
thought
dart
across
his
mind
that
it
be
barely
eleven
o'clock
;
and
that
many
people
be
still
in
the
street
:
 
of
whom
surely
some
may
be
find
to
give
credence
to
his
tale
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
reflection
occur
to
him
,
he
step
forward
:
 
and
say
,
somewhat
hastily
,
that
he
be
ready

<EOS>
neither
his
brief
consideration
,
nor
its
purport

be
lose
on
his
companion

<EOS>
She
eye
him
narrowly
,
while
he
speak
;
and
cast
upon
him
a
look
of
intelligence
which
sufficiently
show
that
she
guess
what
have
be
pass
in
his
thought
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hush

"
say
the
girl
,
stoop
over
him
,
and
point
to
the
door
as
she
look
cautiously
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
strike
by
the
energy
of
her
manner
,
Oliver
look
up
in
her
face
with
great
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
speak
the
truth
;
her
countenance
be
white
and
agitate
;
and
she
tremble
with
very
earnestness

aloud
;

She
point
,
hastily
,
to
some
livid
bruise
on
her
neck

arm
;

continue
,
with
great
rapidity
:

glance
along

empty
street

upon

lip

grasp
Oliver
's
wrist
,
and
put
the
barrel
so
close
to
his
temple
that
they
touch

at
which
moment
the
boy
could
not
repress
a
start
;
"
if

say
your

<EOS>
have
bestow
a
scowl
upon

Mr

<EOS>
"

"
the

of

say
Nancy
:
 
speak
very
emphatically
,
and
slightly
frown
at
Oliver
as
if
to
bespeak
his
serious
attention
to
her
word
:

be

that
if

you
will
prevent

shoot

<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
this
request
,
Nancy
quickly
lay
the
cloth

disappear
for
a
few
minute
,
she
presently
return
with
a
pot
of
porter
and
a
dish
of
sheep
's
head
:
which
give
occasion
to
several
pleasant
witticism
on
the
part
of
Mr
Sikes
,
found
upon
the
singular
coincidence
of
"
jemmy

be
a
can
name
,
common
to

also
to
an
ingenious

much
use

indeed
,
the
worthy
gentleman
,
stimulate
perhaps
by
the
immediate
prospect
of
be
on
active
service
,
be
in
great
spirit
and
good
humour
;
in
proof
whereof
,
it
may
be
here
remark
,
that
he
humorously
drink
all
the
beer
at
a
draught
,
and
do
not
utter
,
on
a
rough
calculation
,
more
than
four
-
score
oath
during
the
whole
progress
of
the
meal
.
   
<EOS>
supper
be
end
---
it
may
be
easily
conceive
that
Oliver
have
no
great
appetite
for
it
---
Mr
Sikes
dispose
of
a
couple
of
glass
of
spirit
and
water
,
and
throw
himself
on
the
bed
;
order
Nancy

with
many
imprecation

Oliver
stretch
himself
in

in

<EOS>
for
a
long
time
Oliver
lie
awake

think
it
not
impossible
that
Nancy
may
seek
that
opportunity
of
whisper
some
further
advice
;
but
the

sit
brood
over

without

as
Oliver

up

"

<EOS>
Oliver

to
a

inquiry
from

<EOS>
Nancy

scarcely
look
at
the

throw
him
a
handkerchief
to
tie
round
his

;
Sikes
give
him
a
large
rough
cape
to
button
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
thus
attire
,
he
give
his
hand
to
the
robber

who
,
merely
pause
to
show
him
with
a
menacing
gesture
that
he
have
that

pistol
in
a
side

pocket
of
his
great

coat

clasp
it
firmly
in

and
,
exchange
a
farewell
with
Nancy
,
lead
him
away
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
turn
,
for
an
instant
,
when
they
reach
the
door
,
in
the
hope
of
meet
a
look
from
the

but
she

They

They

<EOS>
after
the

It

too

all

black

<EOS>
not

and
Sikes

<EOS>
Oliver
sit
huddle
together
,
in
a
corner
of
the
cart
;
bewilder
with
alarm
and
apprehension
;
and
figure
strange
object
in
the
gaunt
tree
,
whose
branch
wave
grimly
to
and
fro
,
as
if
in
some
fantastic
joy
at
the
desolation
of

<EOS>
as
they
pass
Sunbury
Church
,

<EOS>
there

into
more
sombre

there
be
a
dull
sound
of
fall

not

the
leave

the
old
tree
stir
gently
in
the

It

like
quiet

on

<EOS>
They
turn
into
no
house
at
Shepperton
,
as
the
weary
boy
have
expect
;
but
still
keep
walk
on
,
in
mud
and
darkness
,
through
gloomy
lane
and
over
cold
open
waste
,
until
they
come
within

of
the
light
of
a

at

<EOS>
on
look
intently
forward

Oliver
see
that
the
water
be
just
below
them
,
and
that
they
be
come
to
the
foot
of
a
bridge
.
   
<EOS>
Sikes
keep
straight
on
,
until
they
be
close
upon

bridge

suddenly
down

<EOS>
He
be
about
to
throw
himself
on
the
ground
,
and
make
one
struggle
for
his
young
life
,
when
he
see
that
they
stand
before
a
solitary
house
:
all
ruinous

decayed

there

the
aperture
be
so
small

that
the
inmate
have
probably
not
think
it
worth

large
enough

,
which
however
well
they
may
become
the
lip
of
the
light
and
thoughtless
,
do
seem
immeasurably
beneath
the
dignity
of
judge
of
the
land
,
member
of
parliament
,
minister
of
state
,
lord
mayors
,
and
other
great
public
functionary
,
but
more
particularly
beneath
the
stateliness
and
gravity
of
a
beadle
:
 
who
(
as
be
well
know
)
should
be
the
stern
and
most
inflexible
among
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
whatever
be
Mr
Bumble
's
intention
,
however
(
<EOS>
and
no
doubt
they
be
of
the
good
)
<EOS>
:
it
unfortunately
happen
,
as
have
be
twice
before
remark
,
that
the
table
be
a
round
one
;
consequently
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
move
his
chair
by
little
and
little
,
soon
begin
to
diminish
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
matron
;
and
,
continue
to
travel
round
the
outer
edge
of
the
circle
,
bring
his
chair
,
in
time
,
close
to
that
in
which
the
matron
be
seat
.
   
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
two
chair
touch
;
and
when
they
do
so
,
Mr
Bumble
stop
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
if
the
matron
have
move
her
chair
to
the
right
,
she
would
have
be
scorch
by
the
fire
;
and
if
to
the
left
,
she
must
have
fall
into
Mr
Bumble
's
arm
;
so
(
be
a
discreet
matron
,
and
no
doubt
foresee
these
consequence
at
a
glance
)
<EOS>
she
remain
where
she
be
,
and
hand
Mr
Bumble
another
cup
of
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
hard
-
hearted
,
Mrs
Corney
?
"
say
Mr
Bumble
,
stir
his
tea
,
and
look
up
into
the
matron
's
face
;
"
be
you
hard
-
hearted
,
Mrs
Corney
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
"
exclaim
the
matron
,
"
what
a
very
curious
question
from
a
single
man
.
 
<EOS>
what
can
you
want
to
know
for
,
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
beadle
drink
his
tea
to
the
last
drop
;
finish
a
piece
of
toast
;
whisk
the
crumb
off
his
knee
;
wipe
his
lip
;
and
deliberately
kiss
the
matron
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bumble
!
"
cry
that
discreet
lady
in
a
whisper
;
for
the
fright
be
so
great
,
that
she
have
quite
lose
her
voice
,
"
Mr
Bumble
,
I
shall
scream
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
make
no
reply
;
but
in
a
slow
and
dignified
manner
,
put
his
arm
round
the
matron
's
waist
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
lady
have
state
her
intention
of
scream
,
of
course
she
would
have
scream
at
this
additional
boldness
,
but
that
the
exertion
be
render
unnecessary
by
a
hasty
knock
at
the
door
:
 
which
be
no
sooner
hear
,
than
Mr
Bumble
dart
,
with
much
agility
,
to
the
wine
bottle
,
and
begin
dust
them
with
great
violence
:
 
while
the
matron
sharply
demand
who
be
there
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
worthy
of
remark
,
as
a
curious
physical
instance
of
the
efficacy
of
a
sudden
surprise
in
counteract
the
effect
of
extreme
fear
,
that
her
voice
have
quite
recover
all
its
official
asperity
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
mistress
,
"
say
a
withered
old
female
pauper
,
hideously
ugly
:
 
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
,
"
Old
Sally
be
a

go
fast
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
be
that
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
angrily
demand
the
matron
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
keep
her
alive
,
can
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
mistress
,
"
reply
the
old
woman
,
"
nobody
can
;
she
be
far
beyond
the
reach
of
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
many
people
die
;
<EOS>
little
babe
and
great
strong
man
;
and
I
know
when
death
be
a
-
come
,
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
troubled
in
her
mind
:
<EOS>
and
when
the
fit
be
not
on
her
,
---
and
that
be
not
often
,
for
she
be
die
very
hard
,
---
she
say
she
have
get
something
to
tell
,
which
you
must
hear
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
never
die
quiet
till
you
come
,
mistress
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
this
intelligence
,
the
worthy
Mrs
Corney
mutter
a
variety
of
invective
against
old
woman
who
could
not
even
die
without
purposely
annoy
their
better
;
and
,
muffle
herself
in
a
thick
shawl
which
she
hastily
catch
up
,
briefly
request
Mr
Bumble
to
stay
till
she
come
back
,
l
anything
particular
should
occur
.
 
<EOS>
bid
the
messenger
walk
fast
,
and
not
be
all
night
hobble
up
the
stair
,
she
follow
her
from
the
room
with
a
very
ill
grace
,
scold
all
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
's
conduct
on
be
leave
to
himself
,
be
rather
inexplicable
.
 
<EOS>
He
open
the
closet
,
count
the
teaspoon
,
weigh
the
sugar
-
tong
,
closely
inspect
a
silver
milk
-
pot
to
ascertain
that
it
be
of
the
genuine
metal
,
and
,
have
satisfy
his
curiosity
on
these
point
,
put
on
his
cocked
hat
corner
-
wise
,
and
dance
with
much
gravity
four
distinct
time
round
the
table

<EOS>
have
go
through
this
very
extraordinary
performance
,
he
take
off
the
cocked
hat
again
,
and
,
spread
himself
before
the
fire
with
his
back
towards

an
exact

Chapter
24
.
<EOS>
treat
on
a
very
poor
subject
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
a
short
one
,
and
may
be
find
of
importance
in
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
unfit
messanger
of
death
,
who
have
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
matron
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
Her
body
be
bent
by
age
;
her
limb
tremble
with
palsy
;
her
face
,
distort
into
a
mumbling
leer
,
resemble
more
the
grotesque
shaping
of
some
wild
pencil
,
than
the
work
of
Nature
's
hand
.
   
<EOS>
alas
!
 
<EOS>
how
few
of
Nature
's
face
be
leave
alone
to
gladden
us
with
their
beauty
!
 
<EOS>
the
care
,
and
sorrow
,
and
hungering
,
of
the
world
,
change
them
as
they
change
heart
;
and
it
be
only
when
those
passion
sleep
,
and
have
lose
their
hold
for
ever
,
that
the
troubled
cloud
pass
off
,
and
leave
Heaven
's
surface
clear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
common
thing
for
the
countenance
of
the
dead
,
even
in
that
fixed
and
rigid
state
,
to
subside
into
the
long
-
forget
expression
of
sleep
infancy
,
and
settle
into
the
very
look
of
early
life
;
so
calm
,
so
peaceful
,
do
they
grow
again
,
that
those
who
know
them
in
their
happy
childhood
,
kneel
by
the
coffin
's
side
in
awe
,
and
see
the
Angel
even
upon
earth
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
crone
totter
alone
the
passage
,
and
up
the
stair
,
mutter
some
indistinct
answer
to
the
chiding
of
her
companion
;
be
at
length
compel
to
pause
for
breath
,
she
give
the
light
into
her
hand
,
and
remain
behind
to
follow
as
she
may
:
while
the
more
nimble
superior
make
her
way
to
the
room
where
the
sick
woman
lie
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
bare
garret
-
room
,
with
a
dim
light
burn
at
the
farther
end
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
old
woman

by
the
bed
;
the
parish
apothecary

apprentice

a
toothpick

"

"
reply
the
mistress
,
in
her
most
civil
tone

and
drop
a
curtsey
as
she
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
get

deputy

break
a
lump
on
the
top
of
the
fire
with
the
rusty
poker

these

the

They

"
the
least
they
could

would
be
to
keep
us
pretty
warm

for
our
place

"
   
<EOS>
the
conversation
be
here
interrupt
by
a
moan
from
the
sick
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh

"
say
the
young
mag
,
turn
his
face
towards
the
bed

as

ask
the
matron

<EOS>
"
if
she
last
a
couple
of
hour

I
shall
be
surprised

"
say
the
apothecary
's
apprentice
,
intent
upon
the
toothpick

point
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
break

up
of
the
system
altogether

be

old
lady

"
   
<EOS>
the
attendant
stoop
over
the
bed
,
to
ascertain
;
and
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
perhaps
she
will
go
off
in
that
way
,
if
you
do
not
make
a
row
,
"
say
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
put
the
light
on
the
floor

<EOS>
She

not

it
there

"
   
<EOS>
the
attendant
do
as
she
be
tell
:
 
shake
her
head
meanwhile
,
to
intimate
that
the
woman
would
not
die
so
easily
;
have
do
so
,
she
resume
her
seat
by
the
side
of
the
other
nurse
,
who
have
by
this
time
return
.
 
<EOS>
the
mistress
,
with
an
expression
of
impatience
,
wrap
herself
in
her
shawl
,
and
sit
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
the
apothecary
's
apprentice
,
have
complete
the
manufacture
of
the
toothpick
,
plant
himself
in
front
of
the
fire
and
make
good
use
of
it
for
ten
minute
or
so
:
 
when
apparently
grow
rather
dull
,
he
wish
Mrs
Corney
joy
of
her
job
,
and
take
himself
off
on
tiptoe
.
   
<EOS>
when
they
have
sit
in
silence
for
some
time
,
the
two
old
woman
rise
from
the
bed
,
and
crouch
over
the
fire
,
hold
out
their
withered
hand
to
catch
the
heat
.
 
<EOS>
the
flame
throw
a
ghastly
light
on
their
shrivel
face
,
and
make
their
ugliness
appear
terrible
,
as
,
in
this
position
,
they
begin
to
converse
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
do

Anny

she
soon
drop
off

She
have
not

strength

so
I

quiet

I

brood

smoky
fire

<EOS>
He
hold
a
pair
of
bellow
upon
his
knee

with
which
he
have
apparently
be
endeavour

rouse
it
into
more
cheerful
action

he

deep
thought
;

<EOS>
at
a
table
behind

sit
the
Artful
Dodger
,
Master
Charles
Bates
,
and
Mr
Chitling
:
<EOS>
all
intent
upon
a
game
of
whist
;
the
Artful
taking
dummy
against
Master
Bates
and
Mr
Chitling
.
 
<EOS>
the
countenance
of
the
first
-
name
gentleman
,
peculiarly
intelligent
at
all
time
,
acquire
great
additional
interest
from
his
close
observance
of
the
game
,
and
his
attentive
perusal
of
Mr
Chitling
's
hand
;
upon
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
as
occasion
serve
,
he
bestow
a
variety
of
earnest
glance
:
wisely
regulate
his
own
play
by
the
result
of
his
observation
upon
his
neighbour
's
card
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
cold
night
,
the
Dodger
wear
his
hat
,
as
,
indeed
,
be
often
his
custom
within
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
sustain
a
clay
pipe
between
his
tooth
,
which
he
only
remove
for
a
brief
space
when
he
deem
it
necessary
to
apply
for
refreshment
to
a
quart
pot
upon
the
table
,
which
stand
ready
fill
with
gin

and

water
for
the
accommodation
of
the
company

<EOS>
Master
Bates
be
also
attentive
to
the
play
;
but
be
of
a
more
excitable
nature
than
his
accomplished
friend
,
it
be
observable
that
he
more
frequently
apply
himself
to
the
gin
-
and
-
water
,
and
moreover
indulge
in
many
jest
and
irrelevant
remark
,
all
highly
unbecoming
a
scientific
rubber
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
Artful
,
presume
upon
their
close
attachment
,
more
than
once
take
occasion
to
reason
gravely
with
his
companion
upon
these
impropriety
;
all
of
which
remonstrance
,
Master
Bates
receive
in
extremely
good
part
;
merely
request
his
friend
to
be
"
blow
,
"
or
to
insert
his
head
in
a
sack
,
or
reply
with
some
other
neatly
-
turn
witticism
of
a
similar
kind
,
the
happy
application
of
which
,
excited
considerable
admiration
in
the
mind
of
Mr
Chitling
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
remarkable
that
the
latter
gentleman
and
his
partner
invariably
lose
;
and
that
the
circumstance
,
so
far
from
anger
Master
Bates
,
appear
to
afford
him
the
high
amusement
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
he
laugh
most
uproariously
at
the
end
of
every
deal
,
and
protest
that
he
have
never
see
such
a
jolly
game
in
all
his

<EOS>
"
that

I

<EOS>
but
as
the
Jew
,
look
back
,
wave
his
hand
to
intimate
that
he
prefer
be
alone
;
and
,
moreover
,
as
the
little
man
could
not
very
easily
disengage
himself
from
the
chair
;
the
sign
of
the
Cripples
be
,
for
a
time
,
bereft
of
the
advantage
of
Mr
Lively

presence

by
the
time
he
have
get
upon
his
leg
,
the
Jew
have
disappear
;
so
Mr
Lively
,
after
ineffectually
stand
on
tiptoe
,
in
the
hope
of
catch
sight
of
him
,
again
force
himself
into
the
little
chair
,
and
,
exchange
a
shake
of
the
head
with
a
lady
in
the
opposite
shop
,
in
which
doubt
and
mistrust
be
plainly
mingle
,
resume
his
pipe
with
a
grave
demeanour
.
   
<EOS>
the
three
Cripples
,
or
rather
the
Cripples
;
which
be
the
sign
by
which
the
establishment
be
familiarly
know
to
its
patron
:
 
be
the
public
-
house
in
which
Mr
Sikes
and
his
dog
have
already
figure
.
 
<EOS>
merely
make
a
sign
to
a
man
at
the
bar
,
Fagin
walk
straight
upstairs
,
and
open
the
door
of
a
room
,
and
softly
insinuate
himself
into
the
chamber
,
look
anxiously
about
:
shade
his
eye
with
his
hand
,
as
if
in
search
of
some
particular
person
.
   
<EOS>
the
room
be
illuminate
by
two
gas
-
light
;
the
glare
of
which
be
prevent
by
the
bar
shutter
,
and
closely
-
draw
curtain
of
fade
red
,
from
be
visible
outside

<EOS>
the
ceiling
be
blacken
,
to
prevent
its
colour
from
be
injure
by
the
flaring
of
the
lamp
;
and
the
place
be
so
full
of
dense
tobacco
smoke
,
that
at
first
it
be
scarcely
possible
to
discern
anything
more
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
however
,
as
some
of
it
clear
away
through
the
open
door
,
an
assemblage
of
head
,
as
confused
as
the
noise
that
greet
the
ear
,
may
be
make
out
;
and
as
the
eye
grow
more
accustomed
to
the
scene
,
the
spectator
gradually
become
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
numerous
company
,
male
and
female
<EOS>
,
crowd
round
a
long
table
:
at
the
upper
end
of
which
,
sit
a
chairman
with
a
hammer
of
office
in
his
hand
;
while
a
professional
gentleman
with
a
bluish
nose
,
and
his
face
tie
up
for
the
benefit
of
a
toothache
,
preside
at
a
jingle
piano
in
a
remote
corner
.
   
<EOS>
as
Fagin
step
softly
in
,
the
professional
gentleman
,
run
over
the
key
by
way
of
prelude
,
occasion
a
general
cry
of
order
for
a
song
;
which
have
subside
,
a
young
lady
proceed
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
ballad
in
four
verse
,
between
each
of
which
the
accompanyist
play
the
melody
all
through
,
as
loud
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
be
over
,
the
chairman
give
a
sentiment
,
after
which
,
the
professional
gentleman
on
the
chairman
's
right
and
leave
volunteer
a
duet
,
and
sing
it
,
with
great
applause
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
curious
to
observe
some
face
which
stand
out
prominently
from
among
the
group
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
chairman
himself
,
(
the
landlord
of
the
house
,
)
a
coarse
,
rough
,
heavy
build
fellow
,
who
,
while
the
song
be
proceed
,
roll
his
eye
hither
and
thither
,
and
,
seem
to
give
himself
up
to
joviality
,
have
an
eye
for
everything
that
be
do
,
and
an
ear
for
everything
that
be
say
---
and
sharp
one
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
near
him
be
the
singer
:
<EOS>
receive
,
with
professional
indifference
,
the
compliment
of
the
company
,
and
apply
themselves
,
in
turn
,
to
a
dozen
proffer
glass
of
spirit
and
water
,
tender
by
their
more
boisterous
admirer
;
whose
countenance
,
expressive
of
almost
every
vice
in
almost
every
grade
,
irresistibly
attract
the
attention
,
by
their
very
repulsiveness
.
 
<EOS>
cunning
,
ferocity
,
and
drunkeness
in
all
its
stage
,
be
there
,
in
their
strong
aspect
;
and
woman
:
   
some
with
the
last
linger
tinge
of
their
early
freshness
almost
fade
as
you
look
:
 
other
with
every
mark
and
stamp
of
their
sex
utterly
beat
out
,
and
present
but
one
loathsome
blank
of
profligacy
and
crime
;
some
mere
girl
,
other
but
young
woman
,
and
none
past
the
prime
of
life
;
form
the
dark
and
sad
portion
of
this
dreary
picture

<EOS>
Fagin
,
trouble
by
no
grave
emotion
,
look
eagerly
from
face
to
face
while
these
proceeding
be
in
progress

but
apparently
without

that
of
which
he
be
in

<EOS>
succeed

in

the
eye
of

slightly

leave

as
quietly

He

He

all
right
enough

Will

ask

reciprocate
the

<EOS>
the
Jew
be
no
sooner
alone
,
than
his
countenance
resume
its
former
expression
of
anxiety
and
thought
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
brief
reflection
,
he
call
a
hack
-
cabriolet
,
and
bade
the
man
drive
towards
Bethnal
Green
.
<EOS>
He
dismiss
him
within
some
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Mr
Sikes
's
residence
,
and
perform
the
short
remainder
of
the
distance
,
on
foot
.
   
<EOS>
"
now

mutter
the
Jew

as
he
knock
at

softly
upstairs

previous
ceremony

<EOS>
the
girl
be
alone
;
lie
with
her
head
upon

her
hair
straggle
over
it

"
She

coolly

only
miserable

<EOS>
the
old
man
turn
to
close
the
door
,
as
he
make
this
reflection
;
the
noise
thus
occasion

rouse
the
girl

<EOS>
She
eye
his
crafty
face
narrowly

as
she
inquire

impatiently
away

once

twice

feverishly
change
her
position
,
shuffle
her
foot
upon
the
ground

but
this
be
all

<EOS>
during
the
silence
,
the
Jew
look
restlessly
about

as

assure
himself
that

be
no
appearance

Sikes

covertly

apparently
satisfied
with

inspection

he
cough
twice

at
length
he
make
another
attempt

concilitory
tone

the
girl
moan
out
some
half
intelligible
reply

that
she
could
not
tell

seem
,
from
the
smothered
noise
that
escape
her

to

cry

another

<EOS>
He
have
do
many
a
good
job
for
you
,
and
will
do
many
more
when
he
can
;
and
when
he
can
not
he
will
not
;
so
no
more
about
that

"
   
<EOS>
"
regard
this
boy
,
my
dear

"
say
the
Jew
,
rub
the
palm
of
his
hand
nervously
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
boy
must
take
his
chance
with
the
rest
,
"
interrupt
Nancy
,
hastily
;
"
and
I
say
again
<EOS>
,
I
hope
he
be
dead
,
and
out
of
harm
's
way
,
and
out
of
yours
,
---
that
is
,
if
Bill
come
to
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
Toby
get
clear
off
,
Bill
be
pretty
sure
to
be
safe
;
for
Bill
's
worth
two
of
Toby
any
time

"
   
<EOS>
"
and
about
what
I
be
say
,
my
dear
?
"
observe
the
Jew
,
keep
his
glisten
eye
steadily
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
must
say
it
all
over
again
,
if
it
be
anything
you
want
me
to
do
,
"
rejoin
Nancy
;
"
and
if
it
be
,
you
have
better
wait
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
You
put
me
up
for
a
minute
;
but
now
I
be
stupid
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
put
several
other
question
:
all
with
the
same
drift
of
ascertain
whether
the
girl
have
profit
by
his
unguarded
hint
;
but
,
she
answer
them
so
readily
,
and
be
withal
so
utterly
unmoved
by
his
search
look
,
that
his
original
impression
of
her
be
more
than
a
trifle
in
liquor
,
be
confirm
.
 
<EOS>
Nancy
,
indeed
,
be
not
exempt
from
a
failing
which
be
very
common
among
the
Jew
's
female
pupil
;
and
in
which
,
in
their
tenderer
year
,
they
be
rather
encourage
than
check
.
<EOS>
Her
disorder
appearance
,
and
a
wholesale
perfume
of
Geneva
which
pervade
the
apartment
,
afford
stong
confirmatory
evidence
of
the
justice
of
the
Jew
's
supposition
;
and
when
,
after
indulge
in
the
temporary
display
of
violence
above
describe
,
she
subside
,
first
into
dullness
,
and
afterwards
into
a
compound
of
feeling
:
<EOS>
under
the
influence
of
which
she
shed
tear
one
minute
,
and
in
the
next
give
utterance
to
various
exclamation
of
"
never
say
die
!
"
and
diver
calculation
as
to
what
may
be
the
amount
of
the
odd
so
long
as
a
lady
or
gentleman
be
happy
,
Mr
Fagin
,
who
have
have
considerable
experience
of
such
matter
in
his
time
,
see
,
with
great
satisfaction
,
that
she
be
very
far
go
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
have
ease
his
mind
by
this
discovery
;
and
have
accomplish
his
twofold
object
of
impart
to
the
girl
what
he
have
,
that
night
,
hear
,
and
of
ascertaining
,
with
his
own
eye
,
that
Sikes
have
not
return
,
Mr
Fagin
again
turn
his
face
homeward
:
leave
his
young
friend
asleep
,
with
her
head
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
within
an
hour
of
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
the
weather
be
dark
,
and
pierce
cold
,
he
have
no
great
temptation
to
loiter
.
 
<EOS>
the
sharp
wind
that
scour
the
street
,
seem
to
have
clear
them
of
passenger
,
as
of
dust
and
mud
,
for
few
people

abroad
,
and
they
be

hasten
fast
home

<EOS>
It
blow
from
the
right
quarter
for
the
Jew
,
however
,
and
straight
before
it
he
go
:
tremble
,
and
shiver
,
as
every
fresh
gust
drive
him
rudely
on
his
way

<EOS>
He
have
reach
the
corner
of

a
projecting
entrance

lie
in
deep
shadow

cross
the
road

glide
up

whisper
a
voice
close
to
his

the

uneasily
at
his

slacken
his
pace
as

"

on
his

<EOS>
the

shake
his

be
about

they
have
by
this
time
arrive

remarking
,
that
he
have
better
say
what
he
have
get

under
cover

for
his
blood
be
chill
with
stand
about
so
long
,
and
the
wind
blow
through
him
.
   
<EOS>
Fagin
look
as
if
he
could
have
willingly
excuse
himself
from
take
home
a
visitor
at
that
unseasonable
hour
;
and
,
indeed
,
mutter
something
about

but
his
companion
repeat
his
request
in
a
peremptory
manner
,
he
unlock
the
door

and
request
him
to
close
it
softly

"
   
<EOS>
Fagin
stealthily
descend
the
kitchen
stair
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
short
absence
,
he
return
with
a
light
candle
,
and
the
intelligence
that
Toby

asleep
in

with
those

the
Jew

stoop
down

place
the
candle
on
an
upper
flight
of
stair

exactly
opposite

this
done

he
lead

way
into

apartment

a
broken
arm

chair

and
an
old
couch

sofa
without

stand
behind

upon
this
piece
of
furniture

sit
himself
with

draw
up

It

They
converse
for
some
time
in
whisper

<EOS>
though
nothing
of
the
conversation
be
distinguishable
beyond
a
few
disjoint
word
here

there

a
listener
may
easily
have
perceive
that
Fagin
appear
to
be
defend
himself
against
some
remark
of
the
stranger
;
and
that
the
latter
be
in
a
state
of
considerable
irritation
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
have
be
talk
,
thus
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
,
when
Monks
---
by
which
name
the
Jew
have
designate
the
strange
man
several
time
in
the
course
of
their
colloquy

say
,
raise
his
voice
a
little
,
   
"
I
tell
you
again

keep
him
here
among

pickpocket

him

I

it
be

frank
admission
soften

they

face
about

apology

have
all
go
down

speculation

You

remarkable
coincidence

unpleasant

precise
moment

<EOS>
It
be

obvious

that
it
be
the
gate

there
be
no
doubt
regard
the
time
at
which
the
change
have
take
place
,
because
all
three
remember
that
they
have
come
in

instant

together
with
his
two
mongrel
cur

to
join
in
the
pursuit

<EOS>
Mr
Giles
act
in
the
double
capacity
of
butler
and
steward
to
the
old
lady
of
the
mansion
;
Brittles
be
a
lad
of
all
-
work
:
who
,
have
enter
her
service
a
mere
child
,
be
treat
as
a
promising
young
boy
still
,
though
he
be
something
past
thirty
.
   
<EOS>
encourage
each
other
with
such
converse
as
this
;
but
,
keep
very
close
together
,
notwithstanding
,
and
look
apprehensively
round
,
whenever
a
fresh
gust
rattle
through
the
bough
;
the
three
man
hurry
back
to
a
tree
,
behind
which
they
have
leave
their
lantern
,
lest
its
light
should
inform
the
thief
in
what
direction
to
fire
.
 
<EOS>
catch
up
the
light
,
they
make
the
good
of
their
way
home
,
at
a
good
round
trot
;
and
long
after
their
dusky
form
have
cease
to
be
discernible
,
the
light
may
have
be
see
twinkle
and
dance
in
the
distance
,
like
some
exhalation
of
the
damp
and
gloomy
atmosphere
through
which
it
be
swiftly
bear
.
   
<EOS>
the
air
grow
cold
,
as
day
come
slowly
on
;
and
the
mist
roll
along
the
ground
like
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
the
grass
be
wet
;
the
pathway
,
and
low
place
,
be
all
mire
and
water
;
the
damp
breath
of
an
unwholesome
wind
go
languidly
by
,
with
a
hollow
moaning
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
Oliver
lie
motionless
and
insensible
on
the
spot
where
Sikes
have
leave
him
.
   
<EOS>
morning
draw
on
apace
.
 
<EOS>
the
air
become
more
sharp
and
piercing
,
as
its
first
dull
hue
---
the
death
of
night
,
rather
than
the
birth
of
day
---
glimmer
faintly
in
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
the
object
which
have
look
dim
and
terrible
in
the
darkness
,
grow
more
and
more
defined
,
and
gradually
resolve
into
their
familiar
shape
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
come
down
,
thick
and
fast
,
and
patter
noisily
among
the
leafless
bush
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Oliver
feel
it
not
,
as
it
beat
against
him
;
for
he
still
lie
stretched
,
helpless
and
unconscious
,
on
his
bed
of
clay
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
a
low
cry
of
pain
break
the
stillness
that
prevail
;
and
utter
it
,
the
boy
awake
.
 
<EOS>
His
left
arm
,
rudely
bandage
in
a
shawl
,
hang
heavy
and
useless
at
his
side
;
the
bandage
be
saturate
with
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
weak
,
that
he
could
scarcely
raise
himself
into
a
sit
posture
;
when
he
have
do
so
,
he
look
feebly
round
for
help
,
and
groan
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
tremble
in
every
joint
,
from
cold
and
exhaustion
,
he
make
an
effort
to
stand
upright
;
but
,
shudder
from
head
to
foot
,
fall
prostrate
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
short
return
of
the
stupor
in
which
he
have
be
so
long
plunge
,
Oliver
:
 
urge
by
a
creep
sickness
at
his
heart
,
which
seem
to
warn
him
that
if
he
lie
there
,
he
must
surely
die
:
 
get
upon
his
foot
,
and
essay
to
walk
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
dizzy
,
and
he
stagger
to
and
from
like
a
drunken
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
keep
up
,
nevertheless
,
and
,
with
his
head
droop
languidly
on
his
breast
,
go
stumble
onward
,
he
know
not
whither
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
host
of
bewilder
and
confused
idea
come
crowd
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
still
walk
between
Sikes
and
Crackit
,
who
be
angrily
dispute
---
for
the
very
word
they
say
,
sound
in
his
ear
;
and
when
he
catch
his
own
attention
,
as
it
be
,
by
make
some
violent
effort
to
save
himself
from
fall
,
he
find
that
he
be
talk
to
them
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
be
alone
with
Sikes
,
plod
on
as
on
the
previous
day
;
and
as
shadowy
people
pass
them
,
he
feel
the
robber
's
grasp
upon
his
wrist
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
he
start
back
at
the
report
of
fire
-
arm
;
there
rise
into
the
air
,
loud
cry
and
shout
;
light
gleam
before
his
eye
;
all
be
noise
and
tumult
,
as
some
unseen
hand
bear
him
hurriedly
away
.
 
<EOS>
through
all
these
rapid
vision
,
there
run
an
undefined
,
uneasy
conscious
of
pain
,
which
weary
and
torment
him
incessantly
.
   
<EOS>
thus
he
stagger
on
,
creep
,
almost
mechanically
,
between
the
bar
of
gate
,
or
through
hedge
-
gap
as
they
come
in
his
way
,
until
he
reach
a
road
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
rain
begin
to
fall
so
heavily
,
that
it
rouse
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
look
about
,
and
see
that
at
no
great
distance
there
be
a
house
,
which
perhaps
he
could
reach
.
 
<EOS>
pity
his
condition
,
they
may
have
compassion
on
him
;
and
if
they
do
not
,
it
would
be
well
,
he
think
,
to
die
near
human
being
,
than
in
the
lonely
open
field
.
 
<EOS>
He
summon
up
all
his
strength
for
one
last
trial
,
and
bend
his
falter
step
towards
it
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
draw
near
to
this
house
,
a
feeling
come
over
him
that
he
have
see
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
nothing
of
its
detail
;
but
the
shape
and
aspect
of
the
building
seem
familiar
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
that
garden
wall
!
 
<EOS>
on
the
grass
inside
,
he
have
fall
on
his
knee
last
night
,
and
pray
the
two
man
's
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
very
house
they
have
attempt
to
rob
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
feel
such
fear
come
over
him
when
he
recognise
the
place
,
that
,
for
the
instant
,
he
forget
the
agony
of
his
wound
,
and
think
only
of
flight
.
 
<EOS>
flight
!
 
<EOS>
He
could
scarcely
stand
:
 
and
if
he
be
in
full
possession
of
all
the
good
power
of
his
slight
and
youthful
frame
,
whither
could
he
fly
?
 
<EOS>
He
push
against
the
garden
-
gate
;
it
be
unlock
,
and
swing
open
on
its
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
He
totter
across
the
lawn
;
climb
the
step
;
knock
faintly
at
the
door
;
and
,
his
whole
strength
fail
him
,
sink
down
against
one
of
the
pillar
of
the
little
portico
.
   
<EOS>
It
happen
that
about
this
time
,
Mr
Giles
,
Brittles
,
and
the
tinker
,
be
recruit
themselves
,
after
the
fatigue
and
terror
of
the
night
,
with
tea
and
sundrie
,
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
it
be
Mr
Giles
's
habit
to
admit
to
too
great
familiarity
the
humbler
servant
:
towards
whom
it
be
rather
his
will
not
to
deport
himself
with
a
lofty
affability
,
which
,
while
it
gratify
,
could
not
fail
to
remind
them
of
his
superior
position
in
society
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
death
,
fire
,
and
burglary
,
make
all
man
equal
;
so
Mr
Giles
sit
with
his
leg
stretch
out
before
the
kitchen
fender
,
lean
his
left
arm
on
the
table
,
while
,
with
his
right
,
he
illustrate
a
circumstantial
and
minute
account
of
the
robbery
,
to
which
his
bearer
(
but
especially
the
cook
and
housemaid
,
who
be
of
the
party
)
listen
with
breathless
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
about
half
-
past
tow
,
"
say
Mr
Giles
,
"
or
I
would
not
swear
that
it

three

when
I
wake
up

and
,
turn
round
in
my
bed

as
it
may
be
so

(
here
Mr

turn
round
in
his
chair

pull
the
corner

cloth
over
him

I
fancy
I

<EOS>
at
this
point
of
the
narrative
the
cook
turn
pale

ask
the
housemaid
to
shut
the
door

who
ask
Brittles

who
ask

at
first

myself
off

I
heerd
the

distinct

<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
a
noise

ask
the
cook

"
a
kind
of
a
bust
noise

reply
Mr
Giles
,
look
round
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
More
like
the
noise
of
powder
a
iron
bar
on
a
nutmeg

grater

suggest
Brittles

<EOS>
"
It

Mr

roll
back

the
cook
and
housemaid
simultaneously
ejaculate
"
Lor

"
and
draw
their
chair
closer
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
heerd
it
now

quite
apparent

I

with

first

them
to

he
close
the
door
when
they
have
enter
;
and
gently
draw
back
the
curtain
of
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
upon
it
,
in
lieu
of
the
dogged
,
black
-
visaged
ruffian
they
have
expect
to
behold
,
there
lie
a
mere
child
:
 
wear
with
pain
and
exhaustion
,
and
sink
into
a
deep
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
His
wounded
arm
,
bind
and
splinter
up

cross
upon
his
breast

his
head
recline
upon
the
other
arm

half

long
hair

it
stream
over
the

the
honest
gentleman
hold
the
curtain
in

on

for
a
minute

so
,
in
silence

the
young

softly
past

herself
in

Oliver

tear

upon

<EOS>
the
boy
stir
,
and
smile
in
his
sleep
,
as
though
these
mark
of
pity
and
compassion
have
awaken
some
pleasant
dream
of
a
love
and
affection
he
have
never
know

<EOS>
thus
,
a
strain
of
gentle
music
,
or
the
rippling
of
water
in
a
silent
place
,
or
the
odour
of
a
flower
,
or
the
mention
of
a
familiar
word
,
will
sometimes
call
up
sudden
dim
remembrance
of
scene
that
never

in
this
life

which
vanish
like
a
breath
;
which
some
brief
memory
of
a
happy
existence
,
long
go
by

would
seem
to
have
awaken
;
which
no

even

Mr

stop

himself
on

frown
frightfully

after

Giles

there

"
that
be

<EOS>
He
will
wake
in

so
<EOS>

I
dare

;

although
I

the
satisfaction

that

destine

undergo
a
long
trial

Mr

to
expect

for
hour
after
hour

on

still
Oliver

heavily

<EOS>
It
be
evening

indeed

before
the
kind

hearted
doctor
bring
them
the
intelligence

that

at
length
sufficiently

to
be
speak

<EOS>
the
boy
be
very
ill

he
say
,
and
weak
from
the
loss
of
blood
;
but
his
mind
be
so
troubled
with
anxiety
to
disclose
something
,
that
he
deem
it
better
to
give
him
the
opportunity
,
than
to
insist
upon
his
remain
quiet
until
next
morning

which
he
should
otherwise
have
do

<EOS>
the
conference

Oliver

all
his

be
often
compel
to
stop

by
pain

<EOS>
It
be
a
solemn
thing

to
hear
,
in
the
darkened
room

the
feeble
voice
of
the
sick
child
recount
a
weary
catalogue
of
evil
and
calamity
which
hard
man
have
bring
upon
him

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
when
we
oppress
and
grind
our
fellow

creature

we
bestow
<EOS>
but
one
thought
on
the
dark
evidence
of
human
error

which
,
like
dense
and
heavy
cloud

be
rise
,
slowly
it
be
true
,
but
not
less
surely
,
to
Heaven
,
to
pour
their
after

vengeance
on
our
head
;
if
we
hear
but
one
instant
,
in
imagination
,
the
deep
testimony
of
dead
man
's
voice
,
which
no
power
can
stifle
,
and
no
pride
shut
out
;
where
would
be
the
injury
and
injustice

the

misery

everybody
else
in
short

go
into
the
little
room
at
the
end

the
passage

out
at

window

afterwards
go
round
by
way

lawn

in
at

after

have
a
candle
hand
out

inspect
the
shutter
with
;

after
that

a
lantern
to
trace
the
footstep
with

breathless
interest

Mr

be
put
through
a
melodramatic
representation
of
their
share
in
the
previous
night

adventure

which
they
perform
some
six
time
over
:
contradiction
each

clear
the

for
secrecy

solemnity

a
consultation

Rose

I
doubt
it

shake
his

I
do

fool

do
so

the

not

view
with
their
eye

there
be
many
ugly

you

take
a
violent
fancy

him

whether
he
will

no

be
put
through
a
window
to
rob
a
house

then

just
at
the
very
moment

he
be
go
to
alarm
the
inmate

so
do
the
very
thing

set
him
all
to

up

down

great
rapidity

the

rejoin
Blathers

impatiently

<EOS>
"
I
do

;
I
really
do
not

"
say
Giles
,
with
a
rueful
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
swear
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
?
"
ask
Mr
Blathers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

what
to

,
"
reply
poor
Giles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
be
the
boy
;
indeed
,
I
be
almost
certain
that
it
be
not

<EOS>
You
know
it

"

Duff
,
address
Mr
Giles
,
with
supreme
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
have
be
feel
the
patient
's
pulse
during
this
short
dialogue
;
but
he
now
rise
from
the
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
remark
,
that
if
the
officer
have
any
doubt
upon
the
subject
,
they
would
perhaps
like
to
step
into
the
next
room
,
and
have
brittle
before
them
.
   
<EOS>
act
upon
this
suggestion
,
they
adjourn
to
a
neighbouring
apartment
,
where
Mr
Brittles
,
be
call
in
,
involve
himself
and
his
respect
superior
in
such
a
wonderful
maze
of
fresh
contradiction
and
impossibility
,
as
tend
to
throw
no
particular
light
on
anything
,
but
the
fact
of
his
own
strong
mystification
;
except
,
indeed
,
his
declaration
that
he
should
not
know
the
real
boy
,
if
he
be
put
before
him
that
instant
;
that
he
have
only
take
Oliver
to
be
he
,
because
Mr
Giles
have
say
he
be
;
and
that
Mr
Giles
have
,
five
minute
previously
,
admit
in
the
kitchen
,
that
he
begain
to
be
very
much
afraid
he
have
be
a
little
too
hasty
.
   
<EOS>
among
other
ingenious
surmise
,
the
question
be
then
raise
,
whether
Mr
Giles
have
really
hit
anybody
;
and
upon
examination
of
the
fellow
pistol
to
that
which
he
have
fire
,
it
turn
out
to
have
no
more
destructive
loading
than
gunpowder
and
brown
paper
:
a
discovery
which
make
a
considerable
impression
on
everybody
but
the
doctor
,
who
have
draw
the
ball
about
ten
minute
before
.
<EOS>
upon
no
one
,
however
,
do
it
make
a
great
impression
than
on
Mr
Giles
himself
;
who
,
after
labour
,
for
some
hour
,
under
the
fear
of
have
mortally
wound
a
fellow
-
creature
,
eagerly
catch
at
this
new
idea
,
and
favour
it
to
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
the
officer
,
without
trouble
themselves
very
much
about
Oliver
,
leave
the
Chertsey
constable
in
the
house
,
and
take
up
their
rest
for
that
night
in
the
town
;
promise
to

the
next

<EOS>
with
the
next

there
come

man

a
boy

in
the
cage
at
Kingston
,
who
have
be
apprehend
over
night
under
suspicious
circumstance
;
and
to
Kingston
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
journey
accordingly
.
<EOS>
the
suspicious
circumstance
,
however
,
resolve
themselves
,
on
investigation
,
into
the
one
fact
,
that
they
have
be
discover
sleep
under
a
haystack
;
which
,
although
a
great
crime
,
be
only
punishable
by
imprisonment
,
and
be
,
in
the
merciful
eye
of
the
english
law
,
and
its
comprehensive
love
of
all
the
King
's
subject
,
hold
to
be
no
satisfactory
proof
,
in
the
absence
of
all
other
evidence
,
that
the
sleeper
,
or
sleeper
,
have
commit
burglary
accompany
with
violence
,
and
have
therefore
render
themselves
liable
to
the
punishment
of
death
;
Messrs.
Blathers
and
Duff
come
back
again
,
as
wise
as
they
go
.
   
<EOS>
in
short
,
after
some
more
examination
,
and
a
great
deal
more
conversation
,
a
neighbouring
magistrate
be
readily
induce
to
take
the
joint
bail
of
Mrs
Maylie
and
Mr
Losberne
for
Oliver
's
appearance
if
he
should
ever
be

and
Blathers
and
Duff
,
be
reward
with
a
couple
of
guinea
,
return
to
town
with
divided
opinion
on
the
subject
of
their
expedition
:
<EOS>
the
latter
gentleman
on
a
mature
consideration
of
all
the
circumstance
,
incline
to
the
belief
that
the
burglarious
attempt
have
originate
with
the
Family
Pet
;
and
the
former
being
equally
dispose
to
concede
the
full
merit
of
it
to
the
great
Mr
Conkey
Chickweed
.
   
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Oliver
gradually
throve
and
prosper
under
the
united
care
of
Mrs
Maylie
,
Rose
,
and
the
kind

hearted
Mr
Losberne

and
if
they

what
prayer

Oliver

in

to
the
pain
and

attendant
on

his

bring
on
fever

in
a

tearful
word
,
how
deeply

the
goodness
of
the
two

how
ardently
he
hope
that
when
he
grow
strong
and
well
again
,
he
could
do
something
to
show
his
gratitude
;
only
something
,
which
would
let
them
see
the
love
and
duty
with
which
his
breast
be
full
;
something
,
however
slight
,
which
would
prove
to
them
that
their
gentle
kindness
have
not
be
cast
away
;
but
that
the

boy
whom
their

eager
to

<EOS>
in

short
time

one
morning

in

by
some

down

Halloa

amazement

indignation

twist
himself
,
dexterously
,
from
the
doctor

grasp
,
growl
forth
a
volley
of
horrid
oath

and
retire
into
the
house

<EOS>
before
he
could
shut

have
pass
into
the
parlour

without
a

He

anxiously
round

"
as

Mr
Losberne

look
into
the
other
parlour
;

,
like
the
first

bear
no
resemblance
whatever
to
Oliver

account

so

the

shapen
little
demon
set
up
a
yell

dance
upon

ground

as

wild
with
rage

<EOS>
"
stupid
enough

put

<EOS>
with

he
fling
the
hunchback
a
piece
of
money

the
man
follow
to
the
chariot
door

utter
the
wildest
imprecation

curse
all

way

as
Mr
Losberne
turn
to
speak
to
the
driver
,
he
look
into
the
carriage
,
and
eye
Oliver
for
an
instant
with
a
glance
so
sharp
and
fierce
and
at
the
same
time
so
furious
and
vindictive

that

he
could
not
forget
it
for

<EOS>
He
continue
to
utter
the
most
fearful
imprecation
,
until
the
driver
have
resume
his
seat
;
and
when
they
be
once
more
on
their
way
,
they
could
see
him
some
distance
behind
:
beat
his
foot
upon
the
ground
,
and
tear
his
hair
,
in
transport
of
real
or
pretended
rage
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
an
ass
!
"
say
the
doctor
,
after
a
long
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
that
before
,
Oliver
?
"
   
"
no
,
sir
.
"
   
"
then
do
not
forget
it
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
an
ass
,
"
say
the
doctor
again
,
after
a
further
silence
of
some
minute
.
 
<EOS>
"
even
if
it
have
be
the
right
place
,
and
the
right
fellow
have
be
there
,
what
could
I
have
do
,
single
-
handed
?
<EOS>
and
if
I
have
have
assistance
,
I
see
no
good
that
I
should
have
do
,
except
lead
to
my
own
exposure
,
and
an
unavoidable
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
I
have
hush
up
this
business
.
<EOS>
that
would
have
serve
me
right
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
always
involve
myself
in
some
scrape
or
other
,
by
act
on
impulse

<EOS>
It
may
have
do
me
good

"
   
<EOS>
now
,
the
fact
be
that
the
excellent
doctor
have
never
act
upon
anything
but
impulse
all
through
his
life
,
and
if
be
no
bad
compliment
to
the
nature
of
the
impulse
which
govern
him
,
that
so
far
from
be
involve
in
any
peculiar
trouble
or
misfortune
,
he
have
the
warm
respect
and
esteem
of
all
who
know
him

<EOS>
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
he
be
a
little
out
of
temper
,
for
a
minute
or
two
,
at
be
disappoint
in
procure
corroborative
evidence
of
Oliver
's
story
on
the
very
first
occasion
on
which
he
have
a
chance
of
obtain
any

<EOS>
He
soon
come
round
again
,
however
;
and
find
that
Oliver
's
reply
to
his
question
,
be
still
as
straightforward
and
consistent
,
and
still
deliver
with
as
much
apparent
sincerity
and
truth
,
as
they
have
ever
be

he
make
up
his
mind
to
attach
full
credence
to
them

from
that
time
forth

<EOS>
as
Oliver

the
name
of
the
street
in
which
Mr
Brownlow

they
be
enable
to

when
the
coach
turn
into
it

his
heart
beat
so
violently

that
he
could
scarcely
draw
his

My
poor

this
be
disappointment
enough

one
day

say
the
doctor

quite
enough
for
both

we
shall
certainly

no

and
in
obedience

home
they
go

<EOS>
this
bitter
disappointment
cause
Oliver
much
sorrow
and
grief
,
even
in
the
midst
of
his
happiness
;
for
he
have
please
himself
,
many
time
during
his
illness
,
with
thinking
of
all
that
Mr
Brownlow
and
Mrs
Bedwin
would
say
to
him
:
and
what
delight
it
would
be
to
tell
them
how
many
long
day
and
night
he
have
pass
in
reflect
on
what
they
have
do
for
him
,
and
in
bewail
his
cruel
separation
from
them
.
<EOS>
the
hope
of
eventually
clear
himself
with
them
,
too
,
and
explain
how
he
have
be
force
away
,
have
buoy
him
up
,
and
sustain
him
,
under
many
of
his
recent
trial
;
and
now
,
the
idea
that
they
should
have
go
so
far
,
and
carry
with
them
the
belief
that
the
be
an
impostor
and
a
robber
---
a
belief
which
may
remain
uncontradicted
to
his
die
day
---
be
almost
more
than
he
could
bear

<EOS>
the
circumstance
occasion
no
alteration

however

in
the
behaviour
of

scene

have
come
almost
to
love
each
brick

from
day
to
day

to
some
green
sunny
spot

such
memory
waken
up
within
them
by
the
sight
of
the
sky

hill
and
plain

and
glisten

,
that
a
foretaste
of
heaven
itself
have
soothe
their
quick
decline

and
they
have
sink
into
their
tomb
,
as
peacefully
as
the
sun
whose
setting
they
watch
from
their
lonely
chamber
window
but
a
few
hour
before
,
fade
from
their
dim
and
feeble
sight
!
 
<EOS>
the
memory
which
peaceful
country
scene
call
up
,
be
not
of
this
world
,
nor
of
its
thought
and
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Their
gentle
influence
may
teach
us
how
to
weave
fresh
garland
for
the
grave
of
those
we
love
:
 
may
purify
our
thought
,
and
bear
down
before
it
old
enmity
and
hatred
;
but
beneath
all
this
,
there
linger
,
in
the
least
reflective
mind
,
a
vague
and
half
-
form
consciousness
of
have
hold
such
feeling
long
before
,
in
some
remote
and
distant
time
,
which
call
up
solemn
thought
of
distant
time
to
come
,
and
bend
down
pride
and
worldliness
beneath
it
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
lovely
spot
to
which
they
repair
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
,
whose
day
have
be
spend
among
squalid
crowd
,
and
in
the
midst
of
noise
and
brawling
,
seem
to
enter
on
a
new
existence
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
rose
and
honeysuckle
clung
to
the
cottage
wall
;
the
ivy
creep
round
the
trunk
of
the
tree
;
and
the
garden
-
flower
perfume
the
air
with
delicious
odour
.
 
<EOS>
hard
by
,
be
a
little
churchyard
;
not
crowd
with
tall
unsightly
gravestone
,
but
full
of
humble
mound
,
cover
with
fresh
turf
and
moss
:
beneath
which
,
the
old
people
of
the
village
lie
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
often
wander
here
;
and
,
think
of
the
wretched
grave
in
which
his
mother
lie
,
would
sometimes
sit
him
down
and
sob
unseen
;
but
,
when
he
raise
his
eye
to
the
deep
sky
overhead
,
he
would
cease
to
think
of
her
as
lie
in
the
ground
,
and
would
weep
for
her
,
sadly
,
but
without
pain
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
happy
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
peaceful
and
serene
;
the
night
bring
with
them
neither
fear
nor
care
;
no
languishing
in
a
wretched
prison
,
or
associate
with
wretched
man
;
nothing
but
pleasant
and
happy
thought
.
 
<EOS>
every
morning
he
go
to
a
white
-
head
old
gentleman
,
who
live
near
the
little
church
:
who
teach
him
to
read
better
,
and
to
write
:
 
and
who
speak
so
kindly
,
and
take
such
pain
,
that
Oliver
could
never
try
enough
to
please
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
would
walk
with
Mrs
Maylie
and
Rose
,
and
hear
them
talk
of
book
;
or
perhaps
sit
near
them
,
in
some
shady
place
,
and
listen
whilst
the
young
lady
read
:
which
he
could
have
do
,
until
it
grow
too
dark
to
see
the
letter
.
<EOS>
then
,
he
have
his
own
lesson
for
the
next
day
to
prepare
;
and
at
this
,
he
would
work
hard
,
in
a
little
room
which
look
into
the
garden
,
till
evening
come
slowly
on
,
when
the
lady
would
walk
out
again
,
and
he
with
them
:
 
listen
with
such
pleasure
to
all
they
say
:
 
and
so
happy
if
they
want
a
flower
that
he
could
climb
to
reach
,
or
have
forget
anything
he
could
run
to
fetch
:
that
he
could
never
be
quick
enought
about
it
.
<EOS>
when
it
become
quite
dark
,
and
they
return
home
,
the
young
lady
would
sit
down
to
the
piano
,
and
play
some
pleasant
air
,
or
sing
,
in
a
low
and
gentle
voice
,
some
old
song
which
it
please
her
aunt
to
hear
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
no
candle
light
at
such
time
as
these
;
and
Oliver
would
sit
by
one
of
the
window
,
listen
to
the
sweet
music
,
in
a
perfect
rapture
.
   
<EOS>
and
when
Sunday
come
,
how
differently
the
day
be
spend
,
from
any
way
in
which
he
have
ever
spend
it
yet
!
<EOS>
and
how
happily
too
;
like
all
the
other
day
in
that
most
happy
time
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
little
church
,
in
the
morning
,
with
the
green
leave
flutter
at
the
window
:
 
the
bird
singe
without
:
 
and
the
sweet
-
smell
air
steal
in
at
the
low
porch
,
and
fill
the
homely
building
with
its
fragrance
.
<EOS>
the
poor
people
be
so
neat
and
clean
,
and
knelt
so
reverently
in
prayer
,
that
it
seem
a
pleasure
,
not
a
tedious
duty
,
their
assemble
there
together
;
and
though
the
singing
may
be
rude
,
it
be
real
,
and
sound
more
musical
(
to
Oliver
's
ear
at
least
)
than
any
he
have
ever
hear
in
church
before
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
the
walk
as
usual
,
and
many
call
at
the
clean
house
of
the
labour
man
;
and
at
night
,
Oliver
read
a
chapter
or
two
from
the
Bible
,
which
he
have
be
study
all
the
week
,
and
in
the
performance
of
which
duty
he
feel
more
proud
and
pleased
,
than
if
he
have
be
the
clergyman
himself
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
Oliver
would
be
a
-
foot
by
six
o'clock
,
roam
the
field
,
and
plunder
the
hedge
,
far
and
wide
,
for
nosegay
of
wild
flower
,
with
which
he
would
return
laden
,
home
;
and
which
it
take
great
care
and
consideration
to
arrange
,
to
the
good
advantage
,
for
the
embellishment
of
the
breakfast
-
table
.
<EOS>
there
be
fresh
groundsel
,
too
,
for
Miss
Maylie
's
bird
,
with
which
Oliver
,
who
have
be
study
the
subject
under
the
able
tuition
of
the
village
clerk
,
would
decorate
the
cage
,
in
the
most
approved
taste
.
<EOS>
when
the
bird
be
make
all
spruce
and
smart
for
the
day
,
there
be
usually
some
little
commission
of
charity
to
execute
in
the
village
;
or
,
fail
that
,
there
be
rare
cricket
-
playing
,
sometimes
,
on
the
green
;
or
,
fail
that
,
there
be
always
something
to
do
in
the
garden
,
or
about
the
plant
,
to
which
Oliver
(
who
have
study
this
science
also
,
under
the
same
master
,
who

"
You

I

forget

I
hope
I

for
I

have
see
enough
of
illness
and
death
to
know
the
agony
of
separation
from

I

He

<EOS>
swiftly

and
gallop
along
the

as

<EOS>
the

shake
his

utter
these

incoherently

<EOS>
He
advance
towards
Oliver

as

with
the
intention

aim
a
blow
at
him

fall
violently
on

Oliver

for
a
moment

at
the
struggle
of
the
madman
<EOS>
(
for
such
he

him
to
be

then
dart
into
the
house

have
see
him
safely
carry

he
turn
his

run
as
fast

to
make
up
for
lose

and
recall
with
a
great
deal
of
astonishment
and
some
fear
,
the
extraordinary
behaviour
of
the
person
from
whom
he
have
just
part
.
   
<EOS>
the
circumstance
do
not
dwell
in
his
recollection
long
,
however
:
   
for
when
he
reach
the
cottage
,
there
be
enough
to
occupy
his
mind
,
and
to
drive
all
consideration
of
self
completely
from
his

Rose

he

take
Mrs
Maylie
aside

pronounce
her
disorder
to
be
one
of
a
most
alarming
nature

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in

he

"
it
would
be
little
short
of
a
miracle

<EOS>
how
often
do
Oliver
start
from
his
bed
that
night
,
and
steal
out
,
with
noiseless
footstep
,
to
the
staircase
,
listen
for
the
slight
sound
from
the
sick
chamber
!
 
<EOS>
how
often
do
a
tremble
shake
his
frame
,
and
cold
drop
of
terror
start
upon
his
brow
,
when
a
sudden
trampling

foot
cause
him
to
fear
that
something
too
dreadful
to
think
of

have
even
then
occur

<EOS>
and
what
have
be
the
fervency
of
all
the
prayer
he
have
ever
mutter
,
compare
with
those
he
pour
forth
,
now
,
in
the
agony
and
passion
of
his
supplication
for
the
life
and
health
of
the
gentle
creature

who
be
totter
on

acute

oh

<EOS>
the
rack
thought
that
crowd
upon

<EOS>
make
the
heart
beat
violently
,
and
the
breath
come
thick
,
by
the
force
of
the
image
they
conjure
up
before
it
;
the
DESPERATE
ANXIETY
to
be
do
something
to
relieve
the
pain
,
or
lessen
the
danger
,
which
we
have
no
power
to
alleviate
;
the
sinking
of
soul
and
spirit
,
which
the
sad
remembrance
of
our
helplessness
produce

what
torture
can
equal
these

<EOS>
morning
come
;
and
the
little
cottage
be
lonely
and
still
.
<EOS>
People
speak
in
whisper
;
anxious
face
appear
at
the
gate
,
from
time
to
time
;
woman
and
child
go
away
in
tear
.
<EOS>
all
the
livelong
day
,
and
for
hour
after
it
have
grow
dark
,
Oliver
pace
softly
up
and
down
the
garden
,
raise
his
eye
every
instant
to
the
sick
chamber
,
and
shudder
to
see
the
darken
window
,
look
as
if
death
lie
stretch
inside

<EOS>
late
that
night
,
Mr

<EOS>
"
It

hard
,
"
say
the
good
doctor
,
turn
away
as
he
speak
;
"
so
young
;
so
much
beloved
;
but
there
be
very
little
hope
.
"
   
<EOS>
another
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
shine
brightly
;
as
brightly
as
if
it
look
upon
no
misery
or
care
;
and
,
with
every
leaf
and
flower
in
full
bloom
about
her
;
with
life
,
and
health
,
and
sound
and
sight
of
joy
,
surround
her
on
every
side
:
the
fair
young
creature
lie
,
waste
fast
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
creep
away
to
the
old
churchyard
,
and
sit
down
on
one
of
the
green
mound
,
weep
and
pray
for
her
,
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
such
peace
and
beauty
in
the
scene
;
so
much
of
brightness
and
mirth
in
the
sunny
landscape
;
such
blithesome
music
in
the
song
of
the
summer
bird
;
such
freedom
in
the
rapid
flight
of
the
rook
,
career
overhead
;
so
much
of
life
and
joyousness
in
all
;
that
,
when
the
boy
raise
his
ache
eye
,
and
look
about
,
the
thought
instinctively
occur
to
him
,
that
this
be
not
a
time
for
death
;
that
Rose
could
surely
never
die
when
humble
<EOS>
thing
be
all
so
glad
and
gay
;
that
grave
be
for
cold
and
cheerless
winter
:
 
not
for
sunlight
and
fragrance
.
<EOS>
He
almost
think
that
shroud
be
for
the
old
and
shrink
;
and
that
they
never
wrap
the
young
and
graceful
form
in
their
ghastly
fold
.
   
<EOS>
a
knell
from
the
church
bell
break
harshly
on
these
youthful
thought
.
 
<EOS>
another
!
 
<EOS>
again
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
toll
for
the
funeral
service
.
 
<EOS>
a
group
of
humble
mourner
enter
the
gate
:
wear
white
favour
;
for
the
corpse
be
young
.
 
<EOS>
They
stand
uncover
by
a
grave
;
and
there
be
a
mother
---
a
mother
once
---
among
the
weeping
train
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
sun
shine
brightly
,
and
the
bird
sing
on
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
turn
homeward
,
think
on
the
many
kindness
he
have
receive
from
the
young
lady
,
and
wish
that
the
time
could
come
again
,
that
he
may
never
cease
show
her
how
grateful
and
attach
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
cause
for
self
-
reproach
on
the
score
of
neglect
,
or
want
of
thought
,
for
he
have
be
devote
to
her
service
;
and
<EOS>
yet
a
hundred
little
occasion
rise
up
before
him
,
on
which
he
fancy
he
may
have
be
more
zealous
,
and
more
earnest
,
and
wish
he
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
We
need
be
careful
how
we
deal
with
those
about
us
,
when
every
death
carry
to
some
small
circle
of
survivor
,
thought
of
so
much
omit
,
and
so
little
do
---
of
so
many
thing
forget
,
and
so
many
more
which
may
have
be
repair
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
remorse
so
deep
as
that
<EOS>
which
be
unavaile
;
if
we
would
be
spare
its
torture
,
let
us
remember
this
,
in
time
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
reach
home
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
be
sit
in
the
little
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
's
heart
sand
at
sight
of
her
;
for
she
have
never
leave
the
bedside
of
her
niece
;
and
he
tremble
to
think
what
change
could
have
drive
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
learn
that
she
have
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
,
from
which
she
would
waken
,
either
to
recovery
and
life
,
or
to
bid
them
farewell
,
and
die
.
   
<EOS>
They
sit
,
listen
,
and
afraid
to
speak

for
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
untasted
meal
be
remove
,
with
look
which
show
that
their
thought
be
elsewhere
,
they
watch
the
sun
as
he

lower
and
lower
,
and
,
at
length
,
cast
over
sky
and
earth
those
brilliant
hue
which
herald
his
departure

<EOS>
Their
quick
ear
catch
the
sound
of
an
approach
footstep

<EOS>
They
both
involuntarily
dart
to
the
door

as
Mr

stun
and
stupefy
by
the
unexpected
intelligence
;
he
could
not
weep
,
or
speak
,
or
rest
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
the
power
of
understand
anything
that

,
until
,
after
a
long
ramble
in
the
quiet
evening
air
,
a
burst
of
tear
come
to
his
relief
,
and
he
seem
to
awaken

all
at
once
,
to
a
full
sense
of
the
joyful
change
that

almost
insupportable
load
of
anguish
which
have

from
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
the
night
be
fast
close
in

when

<EOS>
laden
with
flower
which
he
have
cull
,
with
peculiar
care
,
for
the
adornment
of
the
sick
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
walk
briskly
along
the
road
,
he
hear
behind
him
,
the
noise
of
some
vehicle
,
approach
at
a
furious
pace
.
 
<EOS>
look
round
,
he
see
that
it
be
a
post

chaise

drive
at
great
speed
;
and
as
the
horse

and
the
road
be
narrow
,
he
stand
lean
against
a
gate
until
it
should
have

<EOS>
as
it
dash
on

Oliver

a
glimpse
of
a
man
in
a
white
nitecap
,
whose
face
seem
familiar
to
him
,
although
his
view
be
so
brief
that
he
could
not

the
person
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
second
or
two

nightcap

thrust
out
of

and
a
stentorian
voice

the
driver
to
stop

<EOS>
which
he
do
,
as
soon
as
he
could
pull
up
his
horse

as
be
the
droll
thing
he
have
ever
hear
,
and
cause
him
to
laugh
proportionately
;
to
the
evident
satisfaction
of
the
doctor
,
who
laugh
immoderately
at
himself
,
and
make
Harry
laugh
almost
as
heartily
,
by
the
very
force
of
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
they
be
as
pleasant
a
party
as
,
under
the
circumstance
,
they
could
well
have
be
;
and
it
be
late
before
they
retire
,
with
light
and
thankful
heart
,
to
take
that
rest
of
which
,
after
the
doubt
and
suspense
they
have
recently
undergo
,
they
stand
much
in
need
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
rise
next
morning
,
in
well
heart
,
and
go
about
his
usual
occupation
,
with
more
hope
and
pleasure
than
he
have
know
for
many
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
bird
be
once
more
hung
out
,
to
sing
,
in
their
old
place
;
and
the
sweetest
wild
flower
that
could
be
find
,
be
once
more
gathered
to
gladden
Rose
with
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
the
melancholy
which
have
seem
to
the
sad
eye
of
the
anxious
boy
to
hang
,
for
day
past
,
over
every
object
,
beautiful
as
all
be
,
be
dispel
by
magic
.
 
<EOS>
the
dew
seem
to
sparkle
more
brightly
on
the
green
leave
;
the
air
to
rustle
among
them
with
a
sweet
music
;
and
the
sky
itself
to
look
more
blue
and
bright
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
influence
which
the
condition
of
our
own
thought
,
exercise
,
even
over
the
appearance
of
external
object
.
 
<EOS>
man
who
look
on
nature
,
and
their
fellow
-
man
,
and
cry
that
all
be
dark
and
gloomy
,
be
in
the
right
;
but
the
sombre
colour
be
reflection
from
their
own
jaundice
eye
and
heart
.
 
<EOS>
the
real
hue
be
delicate
,
and
need
a
clear
vision
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
worthy
of
remark
,
and
Oliver
do
not
fail
to
note
it
at
the
time
,
that
his
morning
expedition
be
no
longer
make
alone
.
<EOS>
Harry
Maylie
,
after
the
very
first
morning
when
he
meet
Oliver
come
laden
home
,
be
seize
with
such
a
passion
for
flower
,
and
display
such
a
taste
in
their
arrangement
,
as
leave
his
young
companion
far
behind
.
 
<EOS>
if
Oliver
be
behindhand
in
these
respect
,
he
know
where
the
good
be
to
be
find
;
and
morning
after
morning
they
scour
the
country
together
,
and
bring
home
the
fair
that
blossom
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
of
the
young
lady
's
chamber
be
open
now
;
for
she
love
to
feel
the
rich
summer
air
stream
in
,
and
revive
her
with
its
freshness
;
but
there
always
stand
in
water
,
just
inside
the
lattice
,
one
particular
little
bunch
,
which
be
make
up
with
great
care
,
every
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
could
not
help
notice
that
the
withered
flower
be
never
throw
away
,
although
the
little
vase
be
regularly
replenish
;
nor
,
could
he
help
observe
,
that
whenever
the
doctor
come
into
the
garden
,
he
invariably
cast
his
eye
up
to
that
particular
corner
,
and
nod
his
head
most
expressively
,
as
he
set
forth
on
his
morning
's
walk
.
 
<EOS>
pende
these
observation
,
the
day
be
fly
by
;
and
Rose
be
rapidly
recover
.
   
<EOS>
nor
do
Oliver
's
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hand
,
although
the
young
lady
have
not
yet
leave
her
chamber
,
and
there
be
no
evening
walk
,
save
now
and
then
,
for
a
short
distance
,
with
Mrs
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
He
apply
himself
,
with
redouble
assiduity
,
to
the
instruction
of
the
white
-
head
old
gentleman
,
and
labour
so
hard
that
his
quick
progress
surprise
even
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
while
he
be
engage
in
this
pursuit
,
that
he
be
greatly
startled
and
distress
by
a
most
unexpected
occurence
.
   
<EOS>
the
little
room
in
which
he
be
accustomed
to
sit
,
when
busy
at
his
book
,
be
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
cottage
-
room
,
with
a
lattice
-
window
:
around
which
be
cluster
of
jessamine
and
honeysuckle
,
that
creep
over
the
casement
,
and
fill
the
place
with
their
delicious
perfume
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
into
a
garden
,
whence
a
wicket
-
gate
open
into
a
small
paddock
;
all
beyond
,
be
fine
meadow
-
land
and
wood
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
dwelling
near
,
in
that
direction
;
and
the
prospect
it
command
be
very
extensive
.
   
<EOS>
one
beautiful
evening
,
when
the
first
shade
of
twilight
be
begin
to
settle
upon
the
earth
,
Oliver
sit
at
this
window
,
intent
upon
his
book
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
pore
over
them
for
some
time
;
and
,
as
the
day
have
be
uncommonly
sultry
,
and
he
have
exert
himself
a
great
deal
,
<EOS>
it
it
<EOS>
no
disparagement
to
the
author
<EOS>
,
whoever
they
may
have
be
,
to
say
,
that
gradually
and
by
slow
degree
,
he
fall
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
kind
of
sleep
that
steal
upon
us
sometimes
,
which
,
while
it
hold
the
body
prisoner
,
do
not
free
the
mind
from
a
sense
of
thing
about
it
,
and
enable
it
to
ramble
at
its
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
as
an
overpower
heaviness
,
a
prostration
of
strength
,
and
an
utter
inability
to
control
our
thought
or
power
of
motion
,
can
be
call
sleep
,
this
be
it
;
and
yet
,
we
have
a
consciousness
of
all
that
be
go
on
about
us
,
and
,
if
we
dream
at
such
a
time
,
<EOS>
word
which
be
really
spoken
,
or
sound
which
really
exist
at
the
moment
,
accommodate
themselves
with
surprising
readiness
to
our
vision
,
until
reality
and
imagination
become
so
strangely
blended
that
it
be
afterwards
almost
matter
of
impossibility
to
separate
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
,
the
most
striking
phenomenon
indcidental
to
such
a
state
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
undoubted
fact
,
that
although
our
sense
of
touch
and
sight
be
for
the
time
dead
,
yet
our
sleep
thought
,
and
the
visionary
scene
that
pass
before
us
,
will
be
influence
and
materially
influence
,
by
the
MERE
silent
PRESENCE
of
some
external
object
;
which
may
not
have
be
near
us
when
we
close
our
eye
:
 
and
of
whose
vicinity
we
have
have
no
wake
consciousness
.
   
<EOS>
Oliver
know
,
perfectly
well
,
that
he
be
in
his
own
little
room
;
that
his
book
be
lie
on
the
table
before
him
;
that
the
sweet
air
be
stir
among
the
creep
plant
outside

<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
the
scene
change
;
the
air
become
close
and
confine
;
and
he
think
,
with
a
glow
of
terror
,
that
he
be
in
the
Jew
's
house
again
.
<EOS>
there
sit
the
hideous
old
man
,
in
his
accustomed
corner
,
point
at
him
,
and
whisper
to
another
man
,
with
his
face
avert
,
who
sit
beside
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
hush
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
he
think
he
hear
the
Jew
say
;
"
it
be
he
,
sure
enough
.
 
<EOS>
come
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
!
"
<EOS>
the
other
man
seem
to
answer
;
"
could
I
mistake
him
,
think
you
?
 
<EOS>
if
a
crowd
of
ghost
be
to
put
themselves
into
his
exact
shape
,
and
he
stand
amongst
them
,
there
be
something
that
would
tell
me
how
to
point
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
bury
him
fifty
foot
deep
,
and
take
me
across
his
grave
,
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
should
know
,
if
there
be
not
a
mark
above
it
,
that
he
lie
bury
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
man
seem
to
say
this
,
with
such
dreadful
hatred
,
that
Oliver
awake
with
the
fear
,
and
start
up
.
   
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
that
,
which
send
the
blood
tingle
to
his
heart
,
and
deprive
him
of
his
voice
,
and
of
power
to
move
!
<EOS>
there
---
there
---
at
the
window
---
close
before
him
---
so
close
,
that
he
could
have
almost
touch
him
before
he
start
back
:
 
with
his
eye
peer
into
the
room
,
and
meet
his
:
 
there
stand
the
Jew
!
 
<EOS>
and
beside
him
,
white
with
rage
or
fear
,
or
both
,
be
the
scowling
feature
of
the
man
who
have
accost
him
in
the
inn
-
yard
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
but
an
instant
,
a
glance
,
a
flash
,
before
his
eye
;
and
they
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
have
recognise
him
,
and
he
them
;
and
their
look
be
as
firmly
impressed
upon
his
memory
,
as
if
it
have
be
deeply
carve
in
stone
,
and
set
before
him
from
his
birth
.
<EOS>
He
stand
transfixed
for
a
moment
;
then
,
leap
from
the
window
into
the
garden
,
call
loudly
for
help

Chapter
35

<EOS>
contain
the
unsatisfactory
result
of
Oliver
's
adventure
;
and
a
conversation
of
some
importance
between
harry
maylie
and
rise
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
inmate
of
the
house
,
attract
by
Oliver
's
cry
,
hurry
to
the
spot
from
which
they
proceed
,
they
find
him
,
pale
and
agitate
,
point
in
the
direction
of
the
meadow
behind
the
house
,
and
scarcely
able
to
articulate
the
word
,
"
the
Jew
!
<EOS>
the
Jew
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Giles
be
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
what
this
outcry
mean
;
but
Harry
Maylie
,
whose
perception
be
something
quick
,
and
who
have
hear
Oliver
's
history
from
his
mother
,
understand
it
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
direction
do
he
take
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
catch
up
a
heavy
stick
which
be
stand
in
a
corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
,
"
reply
Oliver
,
point
out
the
course
the
man
have
take
;
"
I
miss
them
in
an
instant

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
they
be
in
the
ditch
!
"
say
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
follow
!
 
<EOS>
and
keep
as
near
me
,
as
you
can
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
spring
over
the
hedge
,
and
dart
off
with
a
speed
which
render
it
matter
of
exceed
difficulty
for
the
other
to
keep
near
him
.
   
<EOS>
gile
follow
as
well
as
he
could
;
and
Oliver
follow
too
;
and
in
the
course
of
a
minute
or
two
,
Mr
Losberne
,
who
have
be
out
walk
,
and
just
then
return
,
tumble
over
the
hedge
after
them
,
and
pick
himself
up
with
more
agility
than
he
could
have
be
suppose
to
possess
,
strike
into
the
same
course
at
no
contemptible
speed
,
shout
all
the
while
,
most
prodigiously
,
to
know
what
be
the
matter
.
   
<EOS>
on
they
all
go
;
nor
stop
they
once
to
breathe
,
until
the
leader
,
strike
off
into
an
angle
of
the
field
indicate
by
Oliver
,
begin
to
search
,
narrowly
,
the
ditch
and
hedge
adjoining
;
which
afford
time
for
the
remainder
of
the
party
to
come
up
;
and
for
Oliver
to
communicate
to
Mr
Losberne
the
circumstance
that
have
lead
to
so
vigorous
a
pursuit
.
   
<EOS>
the
search
be
all
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
even
the
trace
of
recent
footstep
,
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
They
stand
now
,
on
the
summit
of
a
little
hill
,
command
the
open
field
in
every
direction
for
three
or
four
mile
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
village
in
the
hollow
on
the
left
;
but
,
in
order
to
gain
that
,
after
pursue
the
track
Oliver
have
point
out
,
the
man
must
have
make
a
circuit
of
open
ground
,
which
it
be
impossible
they
could
have
accomplish
in
so
short
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
a
thick
wood
skirt
the
meadow
-
land
in
another
direction
;
but
they
could
not
have
gain
that
covert
for
the
same
reason
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
be
a
dream
,
Oliver
,
"
say
Harry
Maylie
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
reply
Oliver
,
shudder
at
the
very
recollection
of
the
old
wretch
's
countenance
;
"
I
see
him
too
plainly
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
them
both
,
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
who
be
the
other
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Harry
and
Mr
Losberne
,
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
very
same
man
I
tell
you
of
,
who
come
so
suddenly
upon
me
at
the
inn
,
"
say
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
our
eye
fix
full
upon
each
other
;
and
I
could
swear
to
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
take
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
demand
Harry
:
 
"
be
you
sure
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
as
I
be
that
the
man
be
at
the
window
,
"
reply
Oliver
,
point
down
,
as
he
speak
,
to
the
hedge
which
divide
the
cottage
-
garden
from
the
meadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
tall
man
leap
over
,
just
there
;
and
the
Jew
,
run
a
few
pace
to
the
right
,
creep
through
that
gap
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
watch
Oliver
's
earnest
face
,
as
he
speak
,
and
look
from
him
to
each
other
,
seem
to
fell
satisfied
of
the
accuracy
of
what
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
in
no
direction
be
there
any
appearance
of
the
trampling
of
man
in
hurried
flight
.
 
<EOS>
the
grass
be
long
;
but
it
be
trodden
down
nowhere
,
save
where
their
own
foot
have
crush
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
side
and
brink
of
the
ditch
be
of
damp
clay
;
but
in
no
one
place
could
they
discern
the
print
of
man
's
shoe
,
or
the
slight
mark
which
would
indicate
that
any
foot
have
press
the
ground
for
hour
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
strange
!
"
say
Harry
.
   
<EOS>
"
strange
?
"
echo
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blathers
and
Duff
,
themselves
,
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
evidently
useless
nature
of
their
search
,
they
do
not
desist
until
the
come
on
of
night
render
its
further
prosecution
hopeless
;
and
even
then
,
they
give
it
up
with
reluctance
.
 
<EOS>
Giles
be
dispatch
to
the
different
ale
-
house
in
the
village
,
furnish
with
the
good
description
Oliver
could
give
of
the
appearance
and
dress
of
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
of
these
,
the
Jew
be
,
at
all
event

sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
remember

suppose
he
have
be
see
drink

loiter

Giles

without
any
intelligence
,
calculate
to
dispel

lessen
the
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
,
fresh
search
be
make
,
and
the
inquiry
renew
;
but
with
no
well
success
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
day
follow
,
Oliver
and
Mr
Maylie
repair
to
the
market
-
town
,
in
the
hope
of
see
or
hear
something
of
the
man
there
;
but
this
effort
be
equally
fruitless
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
day
,
the
affair
begin
to
be
forget
,
as
most
affair
be
,
when
wonder
,
have
no
fresh
food
to

it
,
die
away
of
itself
.
   
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Rose

rapidly
recover
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
leave
her
room
:
be
able
to
go
out
;
and
mix
once
more
with
the
family
,
carry
joy
into
the
heart
of
all
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
although
this
happy
change
have
a
visible
effect
on
the
little
circle
;
and
although
cheerful
voice
and
merry
laughter
be
once
more
hear
in
the
cottage
;
there
be
at
time
,
an
unwonted
restraint
upon
some
there
:
 
even
upon
Rose
herself
:
which
Oliver
could
not
fail
to
remark
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
and
her
son
be
often
closet
together
for
a
long
time
;
and
more
than
once
Rose
appear
with
trace
of
tear
upon
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
after
Mr
Losberne
have
fix
a
day
for
his
departure
to
Chertsey
,
these
symptom
increase
;
and
it
become
evident
that
something
be
in
progress
which
affect
the
peace
of
the
young
lady
,
and
of
somebody
else
besides
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
one
morning
,
when
Rose
be
alone
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
Harry
Maylie
enter
;
and
,
with
some
hesitation
,
beg
permission
to
speak
with
her
for
a
few
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
few
---
a
very
few

will
suffice

the
young
man

his
chair
towards
her

<EOS>
"
what
I
shall
have

already

<EOS>
Rose
have
be
very
pale
from
the
moment
of
his
entrance
;
but
that
may
have
be
the
effect
of
her
recent
illness
.
 
<EOS>
She
merely
bow
;
and
bend
over
some
plant
that
stand
near
,
wait
in
silence
for
him
to
proceed
.

peg

on
,
rather
rakishly

on

trial
of
the

<EOS>
,
she
push
him
over
a
chair
,
which
be
luckily
well
situate
for
the
purpose

<EOS>
"

Mr

He

(
it
be
needless
to

a
coward
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
by
no

victim
of
similar
infirmity

<EOS>
the
remark

with
a
view
of
impress
the

with
a
just
sense
of

that

ought

He

wear
a
large
cloak

<EOS>
He
have
the
air
of
a
stranger
;
and
seem
,
by
a
certain
haggardness
in
his
look
,
as
well
as
by
the
dusty
soil
on

some
distance

<EOS>
He

so
he

his
gin

that
whenever

he
withdraw
his

in
some
confusion

to
find
that
the
stranger
be

Mr

there

the
man
look
fixedly
at
him
when
he
have
give
this
information

although
he
do
not
withdraw
his
eye
for
some
time
afterwards
,
his
gaze
gradually
become
vacant
and
abstract
,

he
seem

<EOS>
for
some
time
,
he
appear
doubtful
whether
he
ought
to
be
relieve

disappoint
by
the
intelligence

at
length
he
breathe
more
freely
;

withdraw
his
eye

observe
that
it
be
no
great
matter

<EOS>
with
that
he
rise

cunne
enough

opportunity

for
the
lucrative
disposal
of
some
secret
in

his
well
half

the
night
of

which
the
occurrence
of
that
day
have
give
him
good
reason
to
recollect
,
as
the
occasion
on
which
he
have
propose

Mrs

and
although
that
lady
have
never
confide
to
him
the
disclosure
of
which

of
mystery

that
one
woman

shortly
before

that
she
could

have
reason
to
believe

some
light
on

Chapter
38

<EOS>
contain
an
account
of
what
pass
between
Mr
and
Mrs
Bumble
,
and
Mr
Monks
,
at
their
nocturnal
interview
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
dull
,
close
,
overcast
summer
evening
.
 
<EOS>
the
cloud
,
which
have
be
threaten
all
day
,
spread
out
in
a
dense
and
sluggish
mass
of
vapour
,
already
yield
large
drop
of
rain
,
and
seem
to
presage
a
violent
thunder
-
storm
,
when
Mr
and
Mrs
Bumble
,
turn
out
of
the
main
street
of
the
town
,
direct
their
course
towards
a
scatter
little
colony
of
ruinous
house
,
distant
from
it
<EOS>
some
mile
and
a
-
half
,
or
thereabout
,
and
erect
on
a
low
unwholesome
swamp
,
border
upon
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
both
wrap
in
old
and
shabby
outer
garment
,
which
may
,
perhaps
,
serve
the
double
purpose
of
protect
their
person
from
the
rain
,
and
shelter
them
from
observation
.
 
<EOS>
the
husband
carry
a
lantern
,
from
which
,
however
,
no
light
yet
shine
;
and
trudge
on
,
a
few
pace
in
front
,
as
though
---
the
way
be
dirty
---
to
give
his
wife
the
benefit
of
treading
in
his
heavy
footprint
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
on
,
in
profound
silence
;
every
now
and
then
,
Mr
Bumble
relax
his
pace
,
and
turn
his
head
as
if
to
make
sure
that
his
helpmate
be
follow
;
then
,
discover
that
she
be
close
at
his
heel
,
he
mend
his
rate
of
walking
,
and
proceed
,
at
a
considerable
increase
of
speed
,
towards
their
place
of
destination
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
far
from
be
a
place
of
doubtful
character
;
for
it
have
long
be
know
as
the
residence
of
none
but
low
ruffian
,
who
,
under
various
pretence
of
live
by
their
labour
,
subsist
chiefly
on
plunder
and
crime
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
collection
of
mere
hovel
:
 
some
,
hastily
build
with
loose
brick
:
other
,
of
old
worm
-
eat
ship
-
timber
:
jumble
together
without
any
attempt
at
order
or
arrangement
,
and
plant
,
for
the
most
part
,
within
a
few
foot
of
the
river
's
bank
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
leaky
boat
draw
up
on
the
mud
,
and
make
fast
to
the
dwarf
wall
which
skirt
it
:
 
and
here
and
there
an
oar
or
coil
of
rope
:
 
appear
,
at
first
,
to
indicate
that
the
inhabitant
of
these
miserable
cottage
pursue
some
avocation
on
the
river
;
but
a
glance
at
the
shatter
and
useless
condition
of
the
article
thus
display
,
would
have
lead
a
passer
-
by
,
without
much
difficulty
,
to
the
conjecture
that
they
be
dispose
there
,
rather
for
the
preservation
of
appearance
,
than
with
any
view
to
their
be
actually
employ
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
heart
of
this
cluster
of
hut
;
and
skirt
the
river
,
which
its
upper
story
overhung
;
stand
a
large
building
,
formerly
use
as
a
manufactory
of
some
kind
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
,
in
its
day
,
probably
furnish
employment
to
the
inhabitant
of
the
surround
tenement
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
have
long
since
go
to
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
the
rat
,
the
worm
,
and
the
action
of
the
damp
,
have
weaken
and
rot
the
pile
on
which
it
stand
;
and
a
considerable
portion
of
the
building
have
already
sink
down
into
the
water
;
while
the
remainder
,
totter
and
bend
over
the
dark
stream
,
seem
to
wait
a
favourable
opportunity
of
follow
its
old
companion
,
and
involve
itself
in
the
same
fate
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
before
this
ruinous
building
that
the
worthy
couple
pause
,
as
the
first
peal
of
distant
thunder
reverberate
in
the
air
,
and
the
rain
commence
pour
violently
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
place
should
be
somewhere
here
,
"
say
Bumble
,
consult
a
scrap
of
paper
he
hold
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
there
!
"
cry
a
voice
from
above
.
   
<EOS>
follow
the
sound
,
Mr

raise
his
head
and
descry
a
man
look
out
of
a
door
,
breast
-
high
,
on
the
second
story
.
   
<EOS>
"
stand
still
,
a
minute
,
"
cry
the
voice
;
"
I
will
be
with
you
directly
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
which
the
head
disappear
,
and
the
door
close
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
that
the
man
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Mr

's
good
lady
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
mind
what
I
tell
you
,
"
say
the
matron
:
"
and
be
careful
to
say
as
little
as
you
can
,
or
you
will
betray
us
at
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
who
have
eye
the
building
with
very
rueful
look
,
be
apparently
about
to
express
some
doubt
relative
to
the
advisability
of
proceed
any
further
with
the
enterprise
just
then
,
when
he
be
prevent
by
the
appearance
of
Monks
:
who
open
a
small
door
,
near
which
they
stand
,
and
beckon
them
inward
.
   
<EOS>
"
come
in
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
impatiently
,
stamp
his
foot
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
keep
me
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
woman
,
who
have
hesitate
at
first
,
walk
boldly
in
,
without
any
other
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bumble
,
who
be
ashamed
or
afraid
to
lag
behind
,
follow
:
 
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
and
with
scarcely
any
of
that
remarkable
dignity
which
be
usually
his
chief
characteristic
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
the
devil
make
you
stand
linger
there
,
in
the
wet
?
"
say
Monks
,
turn
round
,
and
address
Bumble
,
after
he
have
bolt
the
door
behind
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
---
we
be
only
cool
ourselves
,
"
stammer
Bumble
,
look
apprehensively
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
cool
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
retort
Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
all
the
rain
that
ever
fall
,
or
ever
will
fall
,
will
put
as
much
of
hell
's
fire
out
,
as
a
man
can
carry
about
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
cool
yourself
so
easily
;
do
not
think
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
this
agreeable
speech
,
Monks
turn
short
upon
the
matron
,
and
bend
his
gaze
upon
her
,
till
even
she
,
who
be
not
easily
cow
,
be
fain
to
withdraw
her
eye
,
and
turn
them
them
towards
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
woman

demand
Monks

<EOS>
"
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
woman

"
reply
Mr
Bumble
,
mindful
of
his
wife
's
caution
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
woman
never
can
keep
secret
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
matron
,
interpose
,
and
return
,
as
she
speak

the
searching
look
of
Monks

<EOS>
"
I
know
they
will
always
keep
one
till
it

out

Monks

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
what
may
that
be

ask
the
matron

<EOS>
"
the
loss
of

good
name

Monks
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
by
the

rule

a
party
to

transport
her

I
be
not

bestow
something
half

way
between
a
smile

a
frown
upon

two
companion

again
beckon

across

she
hastily
throw
upon
the
table
a
small
kid
bag
scarcely
large
enough
for
a
french
watch

Monks
pounce
upon

open

It
contain
a

draw
a

breath

no

He

Monks

and
total
absence
of
comfort

together
with
the
disappearance
of
all
such
small
moveable

bespoke
a
state
of
extreme
poverty

the

steal
another

so
keen

full
of

the
girl
draw
closer
to

to

although
she
could

something
aloud
about

upward

"

could
hear
the

as

<EOS>
Fagin
laugh
;
and
make
some
reply
which
do
not
reach
her
,
seem
,
by
the
creaking
of
the
board
,
to
lead
his
companion
to
the
second
story
.
   
<EOS>
before
the
sound
of
their
footstep
have
cease
to
echo
through
the
house
,
the
girl
have
slip
off
her
shoe
;
and
draw
her
gown
loosely
over
her
head
,
and
muffle
her
arm
in
it
,
stand
at
the
door
,
listen
with
breathless
interest

<EOS>
the
moment

she
glide
from

ascend
the
stair
with
incredible
softness

silence

and
be
lose
in

gloom
above

<EOS>
the
room
remain
desert
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour

more

the

glide

tread
;
and
,
immediately
afterwards
,
the
two
man
be
hear
descend

<EOS>
Monks
go
at
once
into

street

<EOS>
"
nothing

reply
the
girl
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
come
!

let
me
get
back
;
that
be

"
   
<EOS>
with
a
sigh
for
every
piece
of
money
,
Fagin
tell
the
amount
into
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
part
without
more
conversation
,
merely
interchange
a
"
good
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
when
the
girl
get
into
the
open
street
,
she
sit
down
upon
a
doorstep
;
and
seem
,
for
a
few
moment
,
wholly
bewilder
and
unable
to
pursue
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
she
arise
;
and
hurry
on
,
in
a
direction
quite
opposite
to
that
in
which
Sikes
be
await
her
return
,
quicken
her
pace
,
until
it
gradually
resolve
into
a
violent
run
.
 
<EOS>
after
completely
exhaust
herself
,
she
stop
to
take
breath
:
 
and
,
as
if
suddenly
recollect
herself
,
and
deplore
her
inability
to
do
something
she
be
bent
upon
,
wring
her
hand
,
and
burst
into
tear
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
her
tear
relieve
her
,
or
that
she
feel
the
full
hopelessness
of
her
condition
;
but
she
turn
back
;
and
hurry
with
nearly
as
great
rapidity
in
the
contrary
direction
;
partly
to
recover
lose
time
,
and
partly
to
keep
pace
with
the
violent
current
of
her
own
thought
:
 
soon
reach
the
dwelling
where
she
have
leave
the
housebreaker
.
   
<EOS>
if
she
betray
any
agitation
,
when
she
present
herself
to
Mr
Sikes
,
he
do
not
observe
it
;
for
merely
inquire
if
she
have
bring
the
money
,
and
receive
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
he
utter
a
growl
of
satisfaction
,
and
replace
his
head
upon
the
pillow
,
resume
the
slumber
which
her
arrival
have
interrupt
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
fortunate
for
her
that
the
possession
of
money
occasion
him
so
much
employment
next
day
in
the
way
of
eating
and
drink
;
and
withal
have
so
beneficial
an
effect
in
smooth
down
the
asperity
of
his
temper
;
that
he
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
be
very
critical
upon
her
behaviour
and
deportment
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
have
all
the
abstract
and
nervous
manner
of
one
who
be
on
the
eve
of
some
bold
and
hazardous
step
,
which
it
have
require
no
common
struggle
to
resolve
upon
,
would
have
be
obvious
to
the
lynx
-
eyed
Fagin
,
who
would
most
probably
have
take
the
alarm
at
once
;
but
Mr
Sikes
lack
the
nicety
of
discrimination
,
and
be
trouble
with
no
more
subtle
misgiving
than
those
which
resolve
themselves
into
a
dog
roughness
of
behaviour
towards
everybody
;
and
be
,
furthermore
,
in
an
unusually
amiable
condition
,
as
have
be
already
observe
;
see
nothing
unusual
in
her
demeanor
,
and
indeed
,
trouble
himself
so
little
about
her
,
that
,
have
her
agitation
be
far
more
perceptible
than
it
be
,
it
would
have
be
very
unlikely
to
have
awaken
his
suspicion
.
   
<EOS>
as
that
day
close
in
,
the
girl
's
excitement
increase
;
and
,
when
night
come
on
,
and
she
sit
by
,
watch
until
the
housebreaker
should
drink
himself
asleep
,
there
be
an
unusual
paleness
in
her
cheek
,
and
a
fire
in
her
eye
,
that
even
Sikes
observe
with
astonishment
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sikes
be
weak
from
the
fever
,
be
lie
in
bed
,
take
hot
water
with
his
gin
to
render
it
less
inflammatory
;
and
have
push
his
glass
towards
Nancy
to
be
replenish
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
when
these
symptom
first
strike
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
why

"
<EOS>
say
the
man
,
raise
himself
on
his
hand
as
he
stare
the

in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

roughly
.

the

shivering

and
as
she
do
so

press
her
hand
upon
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Lord

"
   
<EOS>
the
tone
of
force
gaiety
in
which
the
last
word
be
speak
,
seemd
to
produce
a
deep
impression
on
Sikes
than
the
wild
and
rigid
look
which
have
precede
them

<EOS>
"
I
tell
you

there
be
something
of
the
woman

original
nature
leave
in

;
and
when
she
hear
a
light
step
approach
the
door
opposite

that
by
which

and
think
of
the
wide
contrast
which
the
small
room
would
in
another
moment
contain
,
she
feel
burden
with
the
sense
of
her

deep
shame
,
and
shrink
as
though
she
could
scarcely
bear
the
presence
of
her
with
whom
she
have

this
interview

struggle

proud

betray
a
feeble
gleam
of
the
womanly
feeling
which
she
think
a
weakness

connect
her
with
that
humanity

very
wild

by
drive
him
through

up

with
oath
common

fresh

Her
situation

indeed

one
of
no

trial

difficulty

while
she
feel
the
most
eager
and
burn
desire
to
penetrate
the
mystery
in
which
Oliver

history
be
envelop
,
she
could
not

hold
sacred
the
confidence
which
the
miserable
woman
with
whom
she
have
just
converse
,
have
repose
in
her
,
as
a
young
and
guileless
girl

touch
Rose

mingle
with

love
for
her
young
charge

scarcely

intense
in

her
fond

They
purpose
remain
in
London
only
three
day
,
prior
to
depart
for
some
week
to
a
distant
part
of
the
coast
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
midnight
of
the
first
day
.
 
<EOS>
what
course
of
action
could
she
determine
upon
,
which
could
be
adopt
in
eight
-
and
-
forty
hour
?
<EOS>
or
how
could
she
postpone
the
journey
without
exciting
suspicion
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Losberne
be
with
them
,
and
would
be
for
the
next
two
day
;
but
Rose
be
too
well
acquaint
with
the
excellent
gentleman
's
impetuosity
,
and
foresaw
too
clearly
the
wrath
with
which
,
in
the
first
explosion
of
his
indignation
,
he
would
regard
the
instrument
of
Oliver
's
recapture
,
to
trust
him
with
the
secret
,
when
her
representation
in
the
girl
's
behalf
could
be
second
by
no
experienced
person
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
all
reason
for
the
great
caution
and
most
circumspect
behaviour
in
communicate
it
to
Mrs
Maylie
,
whose
first
impulse
would
infallibly
be
to
hold
a
conference
with
the
worthy
doctor
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
resort
to
any
legal
adviser
,
even
if
she
have
know
how
to
do
so
,
it
be
scarcely
to
be
think
of
,
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
once
the
thought
occur
to
her
of
seek
assistance
from
Harry
;
but
this
awaken
the
recollection
of
their
last
parting
,
and
it
seem
unworthy
of
her
to
call
him
back
,
when
---
the
tear
rise
to
her
eye
as
she
pursue
this
train
of
reflection
---
he
may
have
by
this
time
learn
to
forget
her
,
and
to
be
happy
away
.
   
<EOS>
disturb
by
these
different
reflection
;
incline
now
to
one
course
and
then
to
another
,
and
again
recoil
from
all
,
as
each
successive
consideration
present
itself
to
her
mind
;
Rose
pass
a
sleepless
and
anxious
night
.
 
<EOS>
after
more
communing
with
herself
next
day
,
she
arrive
at
the
desperate
conclusion
of
consult
Harry
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
painful
to
him
,
"
she
think
,
"
to
come
back
here
,
how
painful
it
will
be
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
he
will
not
come
;
he
may
write
,
or
he
may
come
himself
,
and
studiously
abstain
from
meet
me
---
he
do
when
he
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
think
he
would
;
but
it
be
well
for
us
both

"
 
<EOS>
and
here
Rose
drop
the
pen
,
and
turn
away
,
as
though
the
very
paper
which
be
to
be
her
messenger
should
not
see
her
weep

<EOS>
She
have
take
up
the

pen
,
and
lay
it
down
again
fifty
time
,
and
have
consider
and
reconsider
the
first
line
of
her
letter
without
write

Oliver

walk
in

with
Mr
Giles
for
a
body

guard

enter
the
room
in
such
breathless
haste
and
violent
agitation

as
seem
to
betoken
some
new
cause
of
alarm

<EOS>
"
what
make
you
look
so
flurried

"

Rose

advance
to
meet
him

<EOS>
"
I
hardly

I

<EOS>

that
I

him
at
last

you
should
be
able

know
that
I
have
tell
you
the
truth

<EOS>
"
I
never
think
you
have
tell
us
anything
but
the
truth

Rose
,
soothe
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
this
?
<EOS>
---
of
whom
do
you
speak

<EOS>

the
gentleman

scarcely
able

the
gentleman

good

Oliver

shed
tear

and
go
into
a
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
speak
to
him

I
could
not
speak
to
him
,
for
he
do
not
see
me
,
and
I
tremble
so
,
that
I
be
not
able
to
go
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
Giles
ask
,
for
me
,
whether
he
live
there
,
and
they
say
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
look
here

"
say
Oliver
,
open
a
scrap
of
paper
,
"

here
it
be

where

shall
I
do

again

<EOS>
with
her
attention
not
a
little
distract
by
these
and
a
great
many
other
incoherent
exclamation
of
joy
,
Rose
read
the
address
,
which
be
Craven

in
the
Strand

<EOS>
She
very
soon
determine
upon

Quick

only

Oliver
need
no
prompting
to
despatch
,

in
little
more
than
five
minute
they
be
on
their
way
to
Craven

when
they
arrive
there

Rose
leave
Oliver

very
pressing
business

upstairs

hear
from

full
narration

threaten

her
the

victim
of
the

ingenuity
of
Messrs.

actually
put
on
his
hat
preparatory
to
sallye
forth
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
those
worthy

,
doubtless
,
he
would

in

have
carry
the
intention
into
effect

's
consideration
of

by

pursue
Mr

place
this

hang
a

very
good

no

about

in
to
forestall
them

it
seem
to
me

very
quixotic
act

in
direct
opposition

,
before

upon

to
procure
from

an
account

it

should
bestow
some
attention

<EOS>
They
be
a
man

perhaps
they

describe

bony

look

undergrown
man

of

Her

dangle
from
a
stick
which
he
carry
over
his
shoulder

a
small
parcel
wrap
in
a
common
handkerchief

apparently
light
enough

this
circumstance

add
to
the
length

dozen
pace
in

reproach
her
tardiness

her

Mr

habit

repose
a
blind

foolish
confidence

extent

order

find

would
leave
him
an
opportunity

assert
his
innocence

any
theft

would
greatly
facilitate
his
chance

escape

of
course

he
enter
at
this
juncture

into
no
explanation

his
motive

walk
on
very
lovingly
together

in

this
cautious
plan
,
Mr
Claypole
go
on

without
halt

until
he
arrive
at
the
Angel
at
Islington
,
where
he
wisely
judge

from
the
crowd
of
passenger
and
number
of
vehicle
,
that
London
begin
in
earnest

<EOS>
just
pause
to
observe

the
most
crowded
street

consequently
the
most
to

avoid

he
cross
into
Saint

be
soon
deep
in
the
obscurity
of

intricate

dirty
way

lie
between

through

drag

now
step
into
the
kennel
to
embrace
at
a
glance
the
whole
external
character
of
some
small
public

house
;
now
jog
on
again
,
as
some
fancy
appearance
induce
him
to
believe
it
too
public
for
his
purpose

<EOS>
at
length

he
stop
in
front
of
one

more
humble
in
appearance

more
dirty
than

he

yet
see

have
cross
over

survey
it
from

opposite
pavement

graciously
announce

put
up
there

there
may

over

there
seem

Chapter

<EOS>
the
time
arrive
for
Nancy
to
redeem
her
pledge
to
Rose
Maylie
.
<EOS>
She
fail
.
 
<EOS>
Adept
as
she
be
,
in
all
the
art
of
cunning
and
dissimulation
,
the
girl
Nancy
could
not
wholly
conceal
the
effect
which
the
knowledge
of
the
step
she
have
take
,
work
upon
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
remember
that
both
the
crafty
Jew
and
the
brutal
Sikes
have
confide
to
her
scheme
,
which
have
be
hide
from
all
other
:
in
the
full
confidence
that
she
be
trustworthy
and
beyond
the
reach
of
their
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
Vile
as
those
scheme
be
,
desperate
as
be
their
originator
,
and
bitter
as
be
her
feeling
towards
Fagin
,
who
have
lead
her
,
step
by
step
,
deep
and
deep
down
into
an
abyss
of
crime
and
misery
,
<EOS>
whence
be
no
escape
;
still
,
there
be
time
when
,
even
towards
him
,
she
feel
some
relenting
,
lest
her
disclosure
should
bring
him
within
the
iron
grasp
he
have
so
long
elude
,
and
he
should
fall
at
last
---
richly
as
he
merit
such
a
fate
---
by
her
hand

<EOS>
but
,
these
be
the
mere
wandering

unwholly

though
enable
to
fix
itself
steadily
on
one
object
,
and
resolve
not
to
be
turn
aside
by
any
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Her
fear
for
Sikes
would
have
be
more
powerful
inducement
to
recoil
while
there
be
yet
time
;
but
she
have
stipulate
that
her
secret
should
be
rigidly
keep
,
she
have
drop
no
clue
which
could
lead
to
his
discovery
,
she
have
refuse
,
even
for
his
sake
,
a
refuge
from
all
the
guilt
and
wretchedness
that
encompass
her

and
what
more
could
she
do

She

all
her

struggle

they

themselves
upon

again

again

leave
their
trace
too

<EOS>
She
grow
pale

thin

even
within
a

<EOS>
at
time

she

no

she
would
have

<EOS>
at
other
time
,
she
laugh
without
merriment
,
and
be
noisy
without
a
moment
afterwards
---
she
sit
silent
and
dejected
,
brood
with
her
head
upon
her
hand
,
while
the
very
effort
by
which
she
rouse
herself
,
tell

more
forcibly

shrink
back

to
lay
his

on

say
good
-
night
again
,
in
a
steady
voice
,

,
answer
his
parting
look
with
a
nod
of
intelligence

close
the
door
between

<EOS>
Fagin
walk
towards
his
home
,
intent
upon
the
thought
that
be
work
within
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
conceive
the
idea
---
not
from
what
have
just
pass
though
that
have
tend
to
confirm
him
,
but
slowly
and
by
degree
---
that
Nancy
,
weary
of
the
housebreaker
's
brutality
,
have
conceive
an
attachment
for
some
new
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Her
altered
manner
,
her
repeat
absence
from
home
alone
,
her
comparative
indifference
to
the
interest
of
the
gang
for
which
she
have
once
be
so
zealous
,
and
,
add
to
these
,
her
desperate
impatience
to
leave
home
that
night
at
a
particular
hour
,
all
favour
the
supposition
,
and
render
it
,
to
him
at
least
,
almost
matter
of
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
the
object
of
this
new
liking
be
not
among
his
myrmidon
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
a
valuable
acquisition
with
such
an
assistant
as
Nancy
,
and
must
(
thus
Fagin
argue
)
be
secure
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
,
and
a
dark
object
,
to
be
gain
.
 
<EOS>
Sikes
know
too
much
,
and
his
ruffian
taunt
have
not
gall
Fagin
the
less
,
because
the
wound
be
hide
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
must
know
,
well
,
that
if
she
shake
him
off
,
she
could
never
be
safe
from
his
fury
,
and
that
it
would
be
surely
wreak
---
to
the
maiming
of
limb
,
or
perhaps
the
loss
of
life
---
on
the
object
of
her
more
recent
fancy
.
   
<EOS>
"
with
a
little
persuasion
,
"
think
Fagin
,
"
what
more
likely
than
that
she
would
consent
to
poison
him
?
 
<EOS>
woman
have
do
such
thing
,
and
bad
,
to
secure
the
same
object
before
now
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
be
the
dangerous
villain
:
 
<EOS>
the
man
I
hate
:
 
go
;
another
secure
in
his
place
;
and
my
influence
over
the
girl
,
with
a
knowledge
of
this
crime
to
back
it
,
unlimited
.
"
   
<EOS>
these
thing
pass
through
the
mind
of
Fagin
,
during
the
short
time
he
sit
alone
,
in
the
housebreaker
's
room
;
and
with
them
uppermost
in
his
thought
,
he
have
take
the
opportunity
afterwards
afford
him
,
of
sound
the
girl
in
the
broken
hint
he
throw
out
at
parting
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
expression
of
surprise
,
no
assumption
of
an
inability
to
understand
his
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
clearly
comprehend
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
glance
at
parting
show
that
.
   
<EOS>
but
perhaps
she
would
recoil
from
a
plot
to
take
the
life
of
Sikes
,
and
that
be
one
of
the
chief
end
to
be
attain
.
<EOS>
"
how
,
"
think
Fagin
,
as
he
creep
homeward
,
"
can
I
increase
my
influence
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
what
new
power
can
I
acquire
?
"
   
<EOS>
such
brain
be
fertile
in
expedient
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
without
extract
a
confession
from
herself
,
he
lay
a
watch
,
discover
the
object
of
her
altered
regard
,
and
threaten
to
reveal
the
whole
history
to
Sikes
(
of
whom
she
stand
in
no
common
fear
)
unless
she
enter
into
his
design
,
could
he
not
secure
her
compliance
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
say
Fagin
,
almost
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
durst
not
refuse
me
then
.
 
<EOS>
not
for
her
life
,
not
for
her
life
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
mean
be
ready
,
and
shall
be
set
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
you
yet
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
cast
back
a
dark
look
,
and
a
threaten
motion
of
the
hand
,
towards
the
spot
where
he
have
leave
the
bold
villian
;
and
go
on
his
way
:
 
<EOS>
busy
his
bony
hand
in
the
fold
of
his
tattered
garment
,
which
he
wrench
tightly
in
his
grasp
,
as
though
there

hate
enemy
crush
with
every
motion
of
his

state
of

intense
excitement

<EOS>
They
leave

arrive
at
length
before

which
Noah

He
do
so

,
by

light

lamp

see
the

's
retreating
figure

already
at
some
distance
before
him

He
advance
as
near
as
he
consider
prudent

keep
on
the
opposite
side

the
street

the
well
to
observe
her
motion

<EOS>
She
look
nervously
round

twice

thrice
,
and
once
stop
to
let
two
man

close
behind

pass
on

<EOS>
She
seem
to
gather
courage
as
she
advance

to
walk
with
a
steady
and
firm
step

preserve
the

relative

between

with
his
eye
upon

<EOS>
the
appointment

.
 
<EOS>
the
church
clock
chime
three
quarter
past
eleven
,
as
two
figure
emerge
on
London
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
one
,
which
advance
with
a
swift
and
rapid
step
,
be
that
of
a
woman
who
look
eagerly
about
her
as
though
in
quest
of
some
expect
object
;
the
other
figure
be
that
of
a
man
,
who
slink
along
in
the
deep
shadow
he
could
find
,
and
,
at
some
distance
,
accommodate
his
pace
to
her
:
 
stop
when
she
stop
:
 
and
as
she
move
again
,
creep
stealthily
on
:
 
but
never
allow
himself
,
in
the
ardour
of
his
pursuit
,
to
gain
upon
her
footstep
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
they
cross
the
bridge
,
from
the
Middlesex
to
the
Surrey
shore
,
when
the
woman
,
apparently
disappoint
in
her
anxious
scrutiny
of
the
foot
-
passenger
,
turn
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
movement
be
sudden
;
but
he
who
watch
her
,
be
not
throw
off
his
guard
by
it
;
for
,
shrink
into
one
of
the
recess
which
surmount
the
pier
of
the
bridge
,
and
lean
over
the
parapet
the
well
to
conceal
his
figure
,
he
suffer
her
to
pass
on
the
opposite
pavement
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
about
the
same
distance
in
advance
as
she
have
be
before
,
he
slip
quietly
down
,
and
follow
her
again
.
<EOS>
at
nearly
the
centre
of
the
bridge
,
she
stop
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
stop
too
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
dark
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
have
be
unfavourable
,
and
at
that
hour
and
place
there
be
few
people
stir
.
<EOS>
such
as
there
be
,
hurry
quickly
past
:
 
very
possibly
without
see
,
but
certainly
without
notice
,
either
the
woman
,
or
the
man
who
keep
her
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
Their
appearance
be
not
calculate
to
attract
the
importunate
regard
of
such
of
London
's
destitute
population
,
as
chance
to
take
their
way
over
the
bridge
that
night
in
search
of
some
cold
arch
or
doorless
hovel
wherein
to
lay
their
head
;
they
stand
there
in
silence
:
 
neither
speak
nor
speak
to
,
by
any
one
who
pass
.
   
<EOS>
a
mist
hang
over
the
river
,
deepen
the
red
glare
of
the
fire
that
burn
upon
the
small
craft
moor
off
the
different
wharfs
,
and
render
dark
and
more
indistinct
the
murky
building
on
the
bank
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
smoke
-
stain
storehouse
on
either
side
,
rise
heavy
and
dull
from
the
dense
mass
of
roof
and
gable
,
and
frown
sternly
upon
water
too
black
to
reflect
even
their
lumbering
shape
.
<EOS>
the
tower
of
old
Saint
Saviour
's
Church
,
and
the
spire
of
Saint
Magnus
,
so
long
the
giant
-
warder
of
the
ancient
bridge
,
be
visible
in
the
gloom
;
but
the
forest
of
ship
below
bridge
,
and
the
thickly
scatter
spire
of
church
above
,
be
nearly
all
hide
from
sight
.
   
<EOS>
the
girl
have
take
a
few
restless
turn
to
and
fro
---
closely
watch
meanwhile
by
her
hidden
observer
---
when
the
heavy
bell
of
St
Paul
's
toll
for
the
death
of
another
day
.
 
<EOS>
Midnight
have
come
upon
the
crowded
city
.
 
<EOS>
the
palace
,
the
night
-
cellar
,
the
jail
,
the
madhouse
:
 
the
chamber
of
birth
and
death
,
of
health
and
sickness
,
the
rigid
face
of
the
corpse
and
the
calm
sleep
of
the
child
:
 
midnight
be
upon
them
all
.
   
<EOS>
the
hour
have
not
strike
two
minute
,
when
a
young
lady
,
accompany
by
a
grey
-
haired
gentleman
,
alight
from
a
hackney
-
carriage
within
a
short
distance
of
the
bridge
,
and
,
have
dismiss
the
vehicle
,
walk
straight
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
scarcely
set
foot
upon
its
pavement
,
when
the
girl
start
,
and
immediately
make
towards
them
.
   
<EOS>
They
walk
onward
,
look
about
them
with
the
air
of
person
who
entertain
some
very
slight
expectation
which
have
little
chance
of
be
realise
,
when
they
be
suddenly
join
by
this
new
associate
.
 
<EOS>
They
halt
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
but
suppress
it
immediately
;
for
a
man
in
the
garment
of
a
countryman
come
close
up
---
brush
against
them
,
indeed
---
at
that
precise
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
here
,
"
say
Nancy
hurriedly
,
"
I
be
afraid
to
speak
to
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
come
away
---
out
of
the
public
road
---
down
the
step
yonder
!
"
   
<EOS>
as
she
utter
these
word
,
and
indicate
,
with
her
hand
,
the
direction
in
which
she
wish
them
to
proceed
,
the
countryman
look
round
,
and
roughly
ask
what
they
take
up
the
whole
pavement
for
,
pass
on
.
   
<EOS>
the
step
to
which
the
girl
have
point
,
be
those
which
,
on
the
Surrey
bank
,
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
bridge
as
Saint
Saviour
's
Church
,
form
a
landing
-
stair
from
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
spot
,
the
man
bear
the
appearance
of
a
countryman
,
hasten
unobserved
;
and
after
a
moment
's
survey
of
the
place
,
he
begin
to
descend
.
   
<EOS>
these
stair
be
a
part
of
the
bridge
;
they
consist
of
three
flight
.
 
<EOS>
just
below
the
end
of
the
second
,
go
down
,
the
stone
wall
on
the
left
terminate
in
an
ornamental
pilaster
face
towards
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
point
the
low
step
widen
:
 
so
that
a
person
turn
that
angle
of
the
wall
,
be
necessarily
unseen
by
any
other
on
the
stair
who
chance
to
be
above
him
,
if
only
a
step
.
<EOS>
the
countryman
look
hastily
round
,
when
he
reach
this
point
;
and
as
there
seem
no
well
place
of
concealment
,
and
,
the
tide
be
out
,
there
be
plenty
of
room
,
he
slip
aside
,
with
his
back
to
the
pilaster
,
and
there
wait
:
 
pretty
certain
that
they
would
come
no
lower
,
and
that
even
if
he
could
not
hear
what
be
say
,
he
could
follow
them
again
,
with
safety
.
   
<EOS>
so
tardily
steal
the
time
in
this
lonely
place
,
and
so
eager
be
the
spy
to
penetrate
the
motive
of
an
interview
so
different
from
what
he
have
be
lead
to
expect
,
that
he
more
than
once
give
the
matter
up
for
lost
,
and
persuade
himself
,
either
that
they
have
stop
far
above
,
or
have
resort
to
some
entirely
different
spot
to
hold
their
mysterious
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
on
the
point
of
emerge
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
regain
the
road
above
,
when
he
hear
the
sound
of
footstep
,
and
directly
afterwards
of
voice
almost
close
at
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
He
draw
himself
straight
upright
against
the
wall
,
and
,
scarcely
breathing
,
listen
attentively
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
far
enough
,
"
say
a
voice
,
which
be
evidently
that
of
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
suffer
the
young
lady
to
go
any
farther

<EOS>
many
people
would
have
distrust
you
too
much

have
come
even
so
far

you
see
I
be
willing

cry
the

"
You

say
the
gentleman
in
a
kind
tone
,
"
for
what
purpose
can
you
have
bring
us
to
this
strange
place
?
 
<EOS>
why
not
have
let
me
speak
to
you
,
above
there
,
where
it
be
light
,
and
there
be
something
stirring

fatal
consequence

<EOS>
It

nearly
two
hour
before

break
;
that
time
which
in
the
autumn
of
the
year

may
be
truly
call
the
dead
of
night
;
when
the
street
be
silent
and
deserted
;
when
even
sound
appear
to
slumber
,
and
profligacy
and
riot
have
stagger
home
to
dream
;
it
be
at
this
still
and
silent
hour
,
that
Fagin
sit
watch
in
his
old
lair
,
with
face
so
distorted
and
pale
,
and
eye
so
red
and
blood
-
shot
,
that
he
look
less
like
a
man
,
than
like
some
hideous
phantom
,
moist
from
the
grave
,
and
worry
by
an
evil
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
He
sit
crouch
over
a
cold
hearth
,
wrap
in
an
old

his

black
nail

he
disclose
among
his
toothless
gum

few
such
fang

his
eye
for

candle

which
with
a
long

burn
wick
droop
almost
double
,
and
hot
grease
fall
down
in
clot
upon
the
table

plainly
show
that
his
thought
be
busy
elsewhere

<EOS>
indeed
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
mortification
at
the
overthrow
of
his
notable
scheme
<EOS>
;
hatred
of
the
girl
who
have
dare
to
palter
with
stranger
;
and
utter
distrust
of
the
sincerity
of
her
refusal
to
yield
him
up
;
bitter
disappointment
at
the
loss
of
his
revenge
on
Sikes
;
the
fear
of
detection
,
and
ruin
,
and
death
;
and
a
fierce
and
deadly
rage
kindle
by
all
;
these
be
the
passionate
consideration
which
,
follow
close
upon
each
other
with
rapid
and
ceaseless
whirl

shoot
through
the
brain
of
Fagin

every
evil
thought

black
purpose
lie
work
at
his
heart

sit
without

his
attitude
in

appear
to

the
small
heed

until
his
quick
ear
seem

a
footstep
in
the
street

and
fevered
mouth

He

a
man
muffle

Fagin
lay
his
hand
upon

lock
it
in

cupboard

sit
down
again
without

but
he

for
an

during

violently

soon
he
be
up

,
and
away
,
---
not
far
into
the
country
,
but
back
towards
London
by
the
high

road

then
back
again
---
then
over
another
part

then

Thither

sometimes
,
and
sometimes
,
with
a
strange
perversity
,
loiter
at
a
snail

pace
,
or
stop
altogether
and
idly
break
the
hedge
with
a
stick

but
when

get
there
,
all
the
people
he
meet

with
suspicion

back

turn
again
,
without
the
courage
to
purchase
bit
or
drop
,
though
he
have
taste
no
food
for
many
hour
;
and
once
more
he
linger
on
the
Heath
,
uncertain
where
to
go
.
   
<EOS>
He
wander
over
mile
and
mile
of

up

down
,

round

about

at

dismal
wail

close

this

adopt

from

he

He

so
firmly

the
instant

they
raise
a

triumphant
execration

a
glaring

there

<EOS>
at
this
moment
the
word

among
the

that

the

those
upon

quit

run
into

join
the
concourse
that

the
spot

each
man

with
his

all
pant
with
impatience
to
get
near
the
door

completely
block

and
at
this
time
,
between
the
rush
of
some
to
regain
the
space
in

of
the
house

and
the
unavaile
struggle

the

a
strong
running
noose
by
the
aid

his

tooth
almost
in

He
could
let
himself
down
by

and
have

"

<EOS>
he

in
an
unearthly

<EOS>
staggering

<EOS>
It

He

<EOS>
there

a
terrific

<EOS>
the
event
narrate
in
the
last
chapter
be
yet
but
two
day
old
,
when
Oliver
find
himself
,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
in
a
travel
-
carriage
rolling
fast
towards
his
native
town
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Maylie
,

Rose

and
Mrs
Bedwin

and
the

Mr

in

chaise
,
accompany
by
one
other
person
whose
name
have
not
be
mention
.
   
<EOS>
They
have
not
talk
much
upon
the
way
;
for
Oliver
be
in
a
flutter
of
agitation
and
uncertainty
which
deprive
him
of
the
power
of
collect
his
thought
,
and
almost
of
speech
,
and
appear
to
have
scarcely
less
effect
on
his
companion
,
who
share
it
,
in
at
least
an
equal
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
the
two
lady
have
be
very
carefully
make
acquaint
by
Mr
Brownlow
with
the
nature
of
the
admission
which
have
be
force
from
Monks
;
and
although
they
know
that
the
object
of
their
present
journey
be
to
complete
the
work
which
have
be
so
well
begin
,
still
the
whole
matter
be
envelop
in
enough
of
doubt
and
mystery
to
leave
them
in
endurance
of
the
most
intense
suspense
.
   
<EOS>
the
same
kind
friend
have
,
with
Mr
Losberne
's
assistance
,
cautiously
stop
all
channel
of
communication
through
which
they
could
receive
intelligence
of
the
dreadful
occurrence
that
so
recently
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
true
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
they
must
know
them
before
long
,
but
it
may
be
at
a
well
time
than
the
present
,
and
it
could
not
be
at
a
bad
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
,
they
travel
on
in
silence
:
 
<EOS>
each
busy
with
reflection
on
the
object
which
have
bring
them
together
:
 
and
no
one
dispose
to
give
utterance
to
the
thought
which
crowd
upon
all
.
   
<EOS>
but
if
Oliver
,
under
these
influence
,
have
remain
silent
while
they
journey
towards
his
birth
-
place
by
a
road
he
have
never
see
,
how
the
whole
current
of
his
recollection
run
back
to
old
time
,
and
what
a
crowd
of
emotion
be
waken
up
in
his
breast
,
when
they
turn
into
that
which
he
have
traverse
on
foot
:
 
a
poor
houseless
,
wander
boy
,
without
a
friend
to
help
him
,
or
a
roof
to
shelter
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"

out
at
the
carriage
window
<EOS>
;
"
that

Yonder

<EOS>
as
they
approach
the
town

and
at
length
drive
through
its
narrow
street
,
it
become
matter

very
cart

stand
at
the
old
public

there
be
the
workhouse
,
the
dreary
prison
of
his
youthful
day

with
its
dismal
window

on
the
street

lean
porter

They

straight
to

chief
hotel
(
which
Oliver

up
at

a
very
old
postboy
about

It

<EOS>
Fagin
's
last
night
alive
.
 
<EOS>
the
court
be
pave
,
from
floor
to
roof
,
with
human
face
.
<EOS>
inquisitive
and
eager
eye
peer
from
every
inch
of
space
.
<EOS>
from
the
rail
before
the
dock
,
away
into
the
sharp
angle
of
the
small
corner
in
the
gallery
,
all
look
be
fix
upon
one
man
---
Fagin
.
 
<EOS>
before
him
and
behind
:
 
above
,
below
,
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
:
 
he
seem
to
stand
surround
by
a
firmament
,
all
bright
with
gleaming
eye
.
   
<EOS>
He
stand
there
,
in
all
this
glare
of
living
light
,
with
one
hand
rest
on
the
wooden
slab
before
him
,
the
other
hold
to
his
ear
,
and
his
head
thrust
forward
to
enable
him
to
catch
with
great
distinctness
every
word
that
fall
from
the
preside
judge
,
who
be
deliver
his
charge
to
the
jury
.
 
<EOS>
at
time
,
he
turn
his
eye
sharply
upon
them
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
slight
featherweight
in
his
favour
;
and
when
the
point
against
him
be
state
with
terrible
distinctness
,
look
towards
his
counsel
,
in
mute
appeal
that
he
would
,
even
then
,
urge
something
in
his
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
these
manifestation
of
anxiety
,
he
stir
not
hand
or
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
move
since
the
trial
begin
;
and
now
that
the
judge
cease
to
speak
,
he
still
remain
in
the
same
strained
attitude
of
close
attention
,
with
his
gaze
ben
on
him
,
as
though
he
listen
still
.
   
<EOS>
a
slight
bustle
in
the
court
,
recall
him
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
look
round
,
he
see
that
the
juryman
have
turn
together
,
to
consider
their
verdict
.
 
<EOS>
as
his
eye
wander
to
the
gallery
,
he
could
see
the
people
rise
above
each
other
to
see
his
face
:
 
some
hastily
apply
their
glass
to
their
eye
:
 
and
other
whisper
their
neighbour
with
look
expressive
of
abhorrence
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
there
be
,
who
seem
unmindful
of
him
,
and
look
only
to
the
jury
,
in
impatient
wonder
how
they
could
delay
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
no
one
face
---
not
even
among
the
woman
,
of
whom
there
be
many
there
---
could
he
read
the
faint
sympathy
with
himself
,
or
any
feeling
but
one
of
all
-
absorb
interest
that
he
should
be
condemn
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
see
all
this
in
one
bewildered
glance
,
the
deathlike
stillness
come
again
,
and
look
back
<EOS>
he
see
that
the
juryman
have
turn
towards
the
judge
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
   
<EOS>
They
only
seek
permission
to
retire
.
   
<EOS>
He
look
,
wistfully
,
into
their
face
,
one
by
one
when
they
pass
out
,
as
though
to
see
which
way
the
great
number
leant
;
but
that
be
fruitless
.
 
<EOS>
the
jail
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
follow
mechanically
to
the
end
of
the
dock
,
and
sit
down
on
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
point
it
out
,
or
he
would
not
have
see
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
look
up
into
the
gallery
again
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
people
be
eat
,
and
some
fan
themselves
with
handkerchief
;
for
the
crowded
place
be
very
hot
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
young
man
sketch
his
face
in
a
little
note
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
He
wonder
whether
it
be
like
,
and
look
on
when
the
artist
break
his
pencil
-
point
,
and
make
another
with
his
knife
,
as
any
idle
spectator
may
have
do
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
same
way
,
when
he
turn
his
eye
towards
the
judge
,
his
mind
begin
to
busy
itself
with
the
fashion
of
his
dress
,
and
what
it
cost
,
and
how
he
put
it
on
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
fat
gentleman
on
the
bench
,
too
,
who
have
go
out
,
some
half
an
hour
before
,
and
now
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
wonder
within
himself
whether
this
man
have
be
to
get
his
dinner
,
what
he
have
have
,
and
where
he
have
have
it
;
and
pursue
this
train
of
careless
think
until
some
new
object
catch
his
eye
and
rouse
another
.
   
<EOS>
not
that
,
all
this
time
,
his
mind
be
,
for
an
instant
,
free
from
one
oppressive
overwhelming
sense
of
the
grave
that
open
at
his
foot
;
it
be
ever
present
to
him
,
but
in
a
vague
and
general
way
,
and
he
could
not
fix
his
thought
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
even
while
he
tremble
,
and
turn
burn
hot
at
the
idea
of
speedy
death
,
he
fall
to
count
the
iron
spike
before
him
,
and
wonder
how
the
head
of
one
have
be
break
off
,
and
whether
they
would
mend
it
,
or
leave
it
as
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
think
of
all
the
horror
of
the
gallow
and
the
scaffold
---
and
stop
to
watch
a
man
sprinkle
the
floor
to
cool
it
---
and
then
go
on
to
think
again
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
there
be
a
cry
of
silence
,
and
a
breathless
look
from
all
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
jury
return
,
and
pass
him
close
.
<EOS>
He
could
glean
nothing
from
their
face
;
they
may
as
well
have
be
of
stone
.
 
<EOS>
perfect
stillness
ensue
---
not
a
rustle
---
not
a
breath
---
guilty
.
   
<EOS>
the
building
ring
with
a
tremendous
shout
,
and
another
,
and
another
,
and
<EOS>
then
it
echo
loud
groans
,
that
gather
strength
as
they
swell
out
,
like
angry
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
peal
of
joy
from
the
populace
outside
,
greet
the
news
that
he
would
die
on
Monday
.
   
<EOS>
the
noise
subside
,
and
he
be
ask
if
he
have
anything
to
say
why
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
pass
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
resume
his
listening
attitude
,
and
look
intently
at
his
questioner
while
the
demand
be
make
;
but
it
be
twice
repeat
before
he
seem
to
hear
it
,
and
then
he
only
mutter
that
he
be
an
old
man
---
an
old
man
---
and
<EOS>
so
,
drop
into
a
whisper
,
be
silent
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
judge
assume
the
black
cap
,
and
the
prisoner
still
stand
with
the
same
air
and
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
a
woman
in
the
gallery
,
utter
some
exclamation
,
call
forth
by
this
dread
solemnity
;
he
look
hastily
up
as
if
angry
at
the
interruption
,
and
bend
forward
yet
more
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
the
address
be
solemn
and
impressive
;
the
sentence
fearful
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
stand
,
like
a
marble
figure
,
without
the
motion
of
a
nerve
.
 
<EOS>
His
haggard
face
be
still
thrust
forward
,
<EOS>
his
under
-
jaw
hang
down
,
and
his
eye
stare
out
before
him
,
when
the
jailer
put
his
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
beckon
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
gaze
stupidly
about
him
for
an
instant
,
and
obey
.
   
<EOS>
They
lead
him
through
a
paved
room
under
the
court
,
where
some
prisoner
be
wait
till
their
turn
come
,
and
other
be
talk
to
their
friend
,
who
crowd
round
a
grate
which
look
into
the
open
yard
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
there
to
speak
to
him
;
but
,
as
he
pass
,
the
prisoner
fall
back
to
render
him
more
visible
to
the
people
who
be
cling
to
the
bar
:
 
and
they
assail
him
with
opprobrious
name
,
and
screech
and
hiss
.
 
<EOS>
He
shake
his
fist
,
and
would
have
spit
upon
them
;
but
his
conductor
hurry
him
on
,
through
a
gloomy
passage
light
by
a
few
dim
lamp
,
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
   
<EOS>
here
,
he
be
search
,
that
he
may
not
have
about
him
the
mean
of
anticipate
the
law
;
this
ceremony
perform
,
they
lead
him
to
one
of
the
condemn
cell
,
and
leave
him
there
---
alone
.
   
<EOS>
He
sit
down
on
a
stone
bench
opposite
the
door
,
which
serve
for
seat
and
bedstead
;
and
cast
his
blood
-
shoot
eye
upon
the
ground
,
try
to
collect
his
thought
.
<EOS>
after
awhile
,
he
begin
to
remember
a
few
disjoint
fragment
of
what
the
judge
have
say
:
though
it
have
seem
to
him
,
at
the
time
,
that
he
could
not
hear
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
these
gradually
fall
into
their
proper
place
,
and
by
degree
suggest
more
:
 
so
that
in
a
little
time
he
have
the
whole
,
almost
as
it
be
deliver
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
hang
by
the
neck
,
till
he
be
dead
<EOS>
---
that
be
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
hang
by
the
neck
till
he
be
dead
.
   
<EOS>
as
it
come
on
very
dark
,
he
begin
to
think
of
all
the
man
he
have
know
who
have
die
upon
the
scaffold
;
some
of
them
through
his
mean
.
 
<EOS>
They
rise
up
,
in
such
quick
succession
,
that
he
could
hardly
count
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
see
some
of
them
die
,
---
and
have
joke
too
,
because
they
die
with
prayer
upon
their
lip
.
 
<EOS>
with
what
a
rattle
noise
the
drop
go
down
;
and
how
suddenly
they
change
,
from
strong
and
vigorous
man
to
dangle
heap
of
clothe
!
   
<EOS>
some
of
them
may
have
inhabit
that
very
cell
---
sit
upon
that
very
spot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
dark
;
why
do
not
they
bring
a
light
?
 
<EOS>
the
cell
have
be
build
for
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
score
of
man
must
have
pass
their
last
hour
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
sit
in
a
vault
strew
with
dead
body
---
the
cap
,
the
noose
,
the
pinion
arm
,
the
face
that
he
know
,
even
beneath
that
hideous
veil
.
<EOS>
---
light
,
light
!
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
when
his
hand
be
raw
with
beat
against
the
heavy
door
and
wall
,
two
man
appear
:
 
<EOS>
one
bear
a
candle
,
which
he
thrust
into
an
iron
candlestick
fix
against
the
wall
:
 
the
other
dragging
in
a
mattress
on
which
to
pass
the
night
;
for
the
prisoner
be
to
be
leave
alone
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
then
come
the
night
---
dark
,
dismal
,
silent
night
.
 
<EOS>
other
watcher
be
glad
to
hear
this
church
-
clock
strike
,
for
they
tell
of
life
and
come
day
.
 
<EOS>
to
him
they
bring
despair
.
 
<EOS>
the
boom
of
every
iron
bell
come
laden
with
the
one
,
deep
,
hollow
sound
---
death
.
<EOS>
what
avail
the
noise
and
bustle
of
cheerful
morning
,
which
penetrate
even
there
,
to
him
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
another
form
of
knell
,
with
mockery
add
to
the
warning
.
   
<EOS>
the
day
pass
off
.
 
<EOS>
Day
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
day
;
it
be
go
as
soon
as
come
---
and
night
come
on
again
;
night
so
long
,
and
yet
so
short
;
long
in
its
dreadful
silence
,
and
short
in
its
fleeting
hour
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
he
rave
and
blaspheme
;
and
at
another
howl
and
tear
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
venerable
man
of
his
own
persuasion
have
come
to
pray
beside
him
,
but
he
have
drive
them
away
with
curse
.
 
<EOS>
They
renew
their
charitable
effort
,
and
he
beat
them
off
.
   
<EOS>
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
only
one
night
more
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
think
of
this
,
the
day
break
---
Sunday
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
the
night
of
this
last
awful
day
,
that
a
wither
sense
of
his
helpless
,
desperate
state
come
in
its
full
intensity
upon
his
blighted
soul
;
not
that
he
have
ever
hold
any
define
or
positive
hope
of
mercy
,
but
that
he
have
never
be
able
to
consider
more
than
the
dim
probability
of
die
so
soon
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
little
to
either
of
the
two
man
,
who
relieve
each
other
in
their
attendance
upon
him
;
and
they
,
for
their
part
,
make
no
effort
to
rouse
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
sit
there
,
awake
,
but
dream
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
he
start
up
,
every
minute
,
and
with
gasp
mouth
and
burn
skin
,
hurry
to
and
fro
,
in
such
a
paroxysm
of
fear
and
wrath
that
even
they
---
use
to
such
sight
---
recoil
from
him
with
horror
.
 
<EOS>
He
grow
so
terrible
,
at
last
,
in
all
the
torture
of
his
evil
conscience
,
that
one
man
could
not
bear
to
sit
there
,
eye
him
alone
;
and
so
the
two
keep
watch
together
.
   
<EOS>
He
cower
down
upon
his
stone
bed
,
and
think
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
wound
with
some
missile
from
the
crowd
on
the
day
of
his
capture
,
and
his
head
be
bandage
with
a
linen
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
His
red
hair
hang
down
upon
his
bloodless
face
;
his
beard
be
tear
,
and
twist
into
knot
;
his
eye
shine
with
a
terrible
light
;
his
unwashed
flesh
crackle
with
the
fever
that
burn
him
up
.
<EOS>
eight
---
nine
---
then
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
a
trick
to
frighten
him
,
and
those
be
the
real
hour
tread
on
each
other
's
heel
,
where
would
he
be
,
when
they
come
round
again
!
 
<EOS>
eleven
!
 
<EOS>
another
strike
,
before
the
voice
of
the
previous
hour
have
cease
to
vibrate
.
 
<EOS>
at
eight
,
he
would
be
the
only
mourner
in
his
own
funeral
train
;
at
eleven
---
    
those
dreadful
wall
of
Newgate
,
which
have
hide
so
much
misery
and
such
unspeakable
anguish
,
not
only
from
the
eye
,
but
,
too
often
,
and
too
long
,
from
the
thought
,
of
man
,
never
hold
so
dread
a
spectacle
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
the
few
who
linger
as
they
pass
,
and
wonder
what
the
man
be
do
who
be
to
be
hang
to
-
morrow
,
would

,
walk
with
unwilling

away

turn
back
to
conjure
up
the

<EOS>
by
degree
they
fall
off

one

and
,
for
an

in
the

,
the

leave

solitude

It

Chertsey

where

bereft

the
presence
of
his
old

he
would
have
be
discontent
if
his
temperament
have
admit
of
such
a
feeling

and
would
have
turn
quite
peevish
if
he
have
know
how
.
 
<EOS>
for
two

three
month
,
he
content
himself
with

all
he
have
since
become
famous

before

on

in
strict
confidence
afterwards

that
he
consider
it
an
excellent
performance
,
but
deem
it
as
well
not
to
say
so

<EOS>
It
be
a
standing
and
very
favourite
joke

His

deprive

,
be
gradually
reduce

great
indigence

misery
,
and
finally

<EOS>
as

remain
in
their
old
post
,
although
the
former
be
bald
,

<EOS>
They
sleep
at
the
parsonage

but
divide
their
attention
so
equally
among
its
inmate
,
and
Oliver
and
Mr
Brownlow
,
and
Mr
Losberne
,
that
to
this
day
the
villager
have
never
be
able
to
discover
to
which
establishment
they
properly
belong

<EOS>
Master
Charles
Bates
,
appal
by
Sikes
's
crime
,
fall
into
a
train
of
reflection
whether
an
honest
life
be
not
,
after
all
,
the
good
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
it
certainly
be
,
he
turn
his
back
upon
the
scene
of
the
past
,
resolve
to
amend
it
in
some
new
sphere
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
He
struggle
hard
,
and
suffer
much
,
for
some
time
;
but
,
have
a
contented
disposition
,
and
a
good
purpose
,
succeed
in
the
end
;
and
,
from
be
a
farmer
's
drudge
,
and
a
carrier
's
lad
,
he
be
now
the
merry
young
grazier
in
all
Northamptonshire
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
the
hand
that
trace
these
word
,
falter
,
as
it
approach
the
conclusion
of
its
task
;
and
would
weave
,
for
a
little
long
space
,
the
thread
of
these
adventure
.
   
<EOS>
I
would
fain
linger
yet
with
a
few
of
those
among
whom
I
have
so
long
move
,
and
share
their
happiness
by
endeavour
to
depict
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
show
Rose
Maylie
in
all
the
bloom
and
grace
of
early
womanhood
,
shed
on
her
secluded
path
in
life
soft
and
gentle
light
,
that
fall
on
all
who
tread
it
with
her
,
and
shine
into
their
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
paint
her
the
life
and
joy
of
the
fire
-
side
circle
and
the
lively
summer
group
;
I
would
follow
her
through
the
sultry
field
at
noon
,
and
hear
the
low
tone
of
her
sweet
voice
in
the
moonlit
evening
walk
;
I
would
watch
her
in
all
her
goodness
and
charity
abroad
,
and
the
smile
untire
discharge
of
domestic
duty
at
home
;
I
would
paint
her
and
her
dead
sister
's
child
happy
in
their
love
for
one
another
,
and
pass
whole
hour
together
in
picture
the
friend
whom
they
have
so
sadly
lose
;
I
would
summon
before
me
,
once
again
,
<EOS>
those
joyous
little
face
that
cluster
round
her
knee
,
and
listen
to
their
merry
prattle
;
I
would
recall
the
tone
of
that
clear
laugh
,
and
conjure
up
the
sympathise
tear
that
glisten
in
the
soft
blue
eye
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
and
a
thousand
look
and
smile
,
and
turn
<EOS>
fo
thought
and
speech
<EOS>
---
I
would
fain
recall
them
every
one
.
   
<EOS>
how
Mr
Brownlow
go
on
,
from
day
to
day
,
fill
the
mind
of
his
adopt
child
with
store
of
knowledge
,
and
become
attach
to
him
,
more
and
more
,
as
his
nature
develop
itself
,
and
show
the
thriving
seed
of
all
he
wish
him
to
become
<EOS>
---
how
he
trace
in
him
new
trait
of
his
early
friend
,
that
awaken
in
his
own
bosom
old
remembrance
,
melancholy
and
yet
sweet
and
soothing
---
how
the
two
orphan
,
try
by
adversity
,
remember
its
lesson
in
mercy
to
other
,
and
mutual
love
,
and
fervent
thank
to
Him
who
have
protect
and
preserve
them
---
these
be
all
matter
which
need
not
to
be
tell
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
they
be
truly
happy
;
and
without
strong
affection
and
humanity
of
heart
,
and
gratitude
to
that
be
whose
code
be
mercy
,
and
whose
great
attribute
be
benevolence
to
all
thing
that
breathe
,
happiness
can
never
be
attain
.
   
<EOS>
within
the
altar
of
the
old
village
church
there
stand
a
white
marble
tablet
,
which
bear
as
yet
<EOS>
but
one
word
:
 
"
agne
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
coffin
in
that
tomb
;
and
may
it
be
many
,
many
year
,
before
another
name
be
place
above
it
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
the
spirit
of
the
Dead
ever
come
back
to
earth
,
to
visit
spot
hallow
by
the
love
---
the
love
beyond
the
grave
---
of
those
whom
they
know
in
life
,
I
believe
that
the
shade
of
Agnes
sometimes
hover
round
that
solemn
nook
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
none
the
less
because
that
nook
be
in
a
Church
,
and
she
be
weak
and
erring
.
