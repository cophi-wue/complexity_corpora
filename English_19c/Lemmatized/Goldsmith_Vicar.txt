  
<EOS>
the
description
of
the
family
of
Wakefield
;
in
which
a
kindre
likeness
prevail
as
well
of
mind
as
of
person
  
<EOS>
I
be
ever
of
opinion
,
that
the
honest
man
who
marry
and
bring
up
a
large
family
,
do
more
service
than
he
who
continue
single
,
and
only
talk
of
population
.
<EOS>
from
this
motive
,
I
have
scarce
take
order
a
year
before
I
begin
to
think
seriously
of
matrimony
,
and
choose
my
wife
as
she
do
her
wedding
gown
,
not
for
a
fine
glossy
surface
but
such
quality
as
would
wear
well
.
<EOS>
to
do
her
justice
,
she
be
a
good
-
natured
notable
woman
;
and
as
for
breeding
,
there
be
few
country
lady
who
could
shew
more
.
<EOS>
She
could
read
any
english
book
without
much
spelling
,
but
for
pickle
,
preserve
,
and
cookery
,
none
could
excel
her
.
<EOS>
She
pride
herself
also
upon
be
an
excellent
contriver
in
house-
keeping
;
tho
'
<EOS>
I
could
never
find
that
we
grow
rich
with
all
her
contrivance
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
love
each
other
tenderly
,
and
our
fondness
encrease
as
we
grow
old
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
fact
nothing
that
could
make
us
angry
with
the
world
or
each
other
.
<EOS>
We
have
an
elegant
house
,
situate
in
a
fine
country
,
and
a
good
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
the
year
be
spend
in
moral
or
rural
amusement
;
in
visit
our
rich
neighbour
,
and
relieve
such
as
be
poor
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
revolution
to
fear
,
nor
fatigue
to
undergo
;
all
our
adventure
be
by
the
fire
-
side
,
and
all
our
migration
from
the
blue
bed
to
the
brown
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
live
near
the
road
,
we
often
have
the
traveller
or
stranger
visit
us
to
taste
our
gooseberry
wine
,
for
which
we
have
great
reputation
;
and
I
profess
with
the
veracity
of
an
historian
,
that
I
never
know
one
of
them
find
fault
with
it
.
<EOS>
Our
cousin
too
,
even
to
the
fortieth
remove
,
all
remember
their
affinity
,
without
any
help
from
the
Herald
's
office
,
and
come
very
frequently
to
see
us
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
do
us
no
great
honour
by
these
claim
of
kindred
;
as
we
have
the
blind
,
the
maim
,
and
the
halt
amongst
the
number
.
<EOS>
however
,
my
wife
always
insist
that
as
they
be
the
same
flesh
and
blood
,
they
should
sit
with
us
at
the
same
table
.
<EOS>
so
that
if
we
have
not
,
very
rich
,
we
generally
have
very
happy
friend
about
us
;
for
this
remark
will
hold
good
thro
'
life
,
that
the
poor
the
guest
,
the
better
please
he
ever
be
with
be
treat
:
and
as
some
man
gaze
with
admiration
at
the
colour
of
a
tulip
,
or
the
wing
of
a
butterfly
,
so
I
be
by
nature
an
admirer
of
happy
human
face
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
any
one
of
our
relation
be
find
to
be
a
person
of
very
bad
character
,
a
troublesome
guest
,
or
one
we
desire
to
get
rid
of
,
upon
his
leave
my
house
,
I
ever
take
care
to
lend
him
a
ride
coat
,
or
a
pair
of
boot
,
or
sometimes
an
horse
of
small
value
,
and
I
always
have
the
satisfaction
of
find
he
never
come
back
to
return
them
.
<EOS>
by
this
the
house
be
clear
of
such
as
we
do
not
like
;
but
never
be
the
family
of
Wakefield
know
to
turn
the
traveller
or
the
poor
dependent
out
of
door
.
  
<EOS>
thus
we
live
several
year
in
a
state
of
much
happiness
,
not
but
that
we
sometimes
have
those
little
rub
which
Providence
send
to
enhance
the
value
of
its
favour
.
<EOS>
My
orchard
be
often
rob
by
school
-
boy
,
and
my
wife
's
custard
plunder
by
the
cat
or
the
child
.
<EOS>
the
"
Squire
would
sometimes
fall
asleep
in
the
most
pathetic
part
of
my
sermon
,
or
his
lady
return
my
wife
's
civility
at
church
with
a
mutilated
curtesy
.
<EOS>
but
we
soon
get
over
the
uneasiness
cause
by
such
accident
,
and
usually
in
three
or
four
day
begin
to
wonder
how
they
vext
us
.
  
<EOS>
My
child
,
the
offspring
of
temperance
,
as
they
be
educate
without
softness
,
so
they
be
at
once
well
form
and
healthy
;
my
son
hardy
and
active
,
my
daughter
beautiful
and
bloom
.
<EOS>
when
I
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
little
circle
,
which
promise
to
be
the
support
of
my
decline
age
,
I
could
not
avoid
repeat
the
famous
story
of
Count
Abensberg
,
who
,
in
Henry
II
's
progress
through
Germany
,
while
other
courtier
come
with
their
treasure
,
bring
his
thirty
-
two
child
,
and
present
them
to
his
sovereign
as
the
most
valuable
offering
he
have
to
bestow
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
,
though
I
have
but
six
,
I
consider
them
as
a
very
valuable
present
make
to
my
country
,
and
consequently
look
upon
it
as
my
debtor
.
<EOS>
Our
eld
son
be
name
George
,
after
his
uncle
,
who
leave
us
ten
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
Our
second
child
,
a
girl
,
I
intend
to
call
after
her
aunt
Grissel
;
but
my
wife
,
who
during
her
pregnancy
have
be
read
romance
,
insist
upon
her
be
call
Olivia
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
another
year
we
have
another
daughter
,
and
now
I
be
determined
that
Grissel
should
be
her
name
;
but
<EOS>
a
rich
relation
take
a
fancy
to
stand
godmother
,
the
girl
be
,
by
her
direction
,
call
Sophia
;
so
that
we
have
two
romantic
name
in
the
family
;
but
I
solemnly
protest
I
have
no
hand
in
it
.
<EOS>
Moses
be
our
next
,
and
after
an
interval
of
twelve
year
,
we
have
two
son
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
fruitless
to
deny
my
exultation
when
I
see
my
little
one
about
me
;
but
the
vanity
and
the
satisfaction
of
my
wife
be
even
great
than
mine
.
<EOS>
when
our
visitor
would
say
,
"
well
,
upon
my
word
,
Mrs
Primrose
,
you
have
the
fine
child
in
the
whole
country
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
neighbour
,
"
she
would
answer
,
"
they
be
as
heaven
make
them
,
handsome
enough
,
if
they
be
good
enough
;
for
handsome
be
that
handsome
do
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
would
bid
the
girl
hold
up
their
head
;
who
,
to
conceal
nothing
,
be
certainly
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
mere
outside
be
so
very
trifle
a
circumstance
with
me
,
that
I
should
scarce
have
remember
to
mention
it
<EOS>
,
have
it
not
be
a
general
topic
of
conversation
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Olivia
,
now
about
eighteen
,
have
that
luxuriancy
of
beauty
with
which
painter
generally
draw
Hebe
;
open
,
sprightly
,
and
command
.
<EOS>
Sophia
's
feature
be
not
so
striking
at
first
;
but
often
do
more
certain
execution
;
for
they
be
soft
,
modest
,
and
alluring
.
<EOS>
the
one
vanquish
by
a
single
blow
,
the
other
by
effort
successfully
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
the
temper
of
a
woman
be
generally
form
from
the
turn
of
her
feature
,
at
least
it
be
so
with
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
Olivia
wish
for
many
lover
,
Sophia
to
secure
one
.
<EOS>
Olivia
be
often
affect
from
too
great
a
desire
to
please
.
<EOS>
Sophia
even
represt
excellence
from
her
fear
to
offend
.
<EOS>
the
one
entertain
me
with
her
vivacity
when
I
be
gay
,
the
other
with
her
sense
when
I
be
serious
.
<EOS>
but
these
quality
be
never
carry
to
excess
in
either
,
and
I
have
often
see
them
exchange
character
for
a
whole
day
together
.
<EOS>
a
suit
of
mourning
have
transform
my
coquet
into
a
prude
,
and
a
new
set
of
ribband
have
give
her
young
sister
more
than
natural
vivacity
.
<EOS>
My
eld
son
George
be
breed
at
Oxford
,
as
I
intend
him
for
one
of
the
learned
profession
.
<EOS>
My
second
boy
Moses
,
whom
I
design
for
business
,
receive
a
sort
of
a
miscellaneous
education
at
home
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
needless
to
attempt
describe
the
particular
character
of
young
people
that
have
see
but
very
little
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
a
family
likeness
prevail
through
all
,
and
properly
speak
,
they
have
but
one
character
,
that
of
be
all
equally
generous
,
credulous
,
simple
,
and
inoffensive
.
    
<EOS>
Family
misfortune
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
fortune
only
serve
to
encrease
the
pride
of
the
worthy
  
the
temporal
concern
of
our
family
be
chiefly
committed
to
my
wife
's
management
,
as
to
the
spiritual
I
take
them
entirely
under
my
own
direction
.
<EOS>
the
profit
of
my
living
,
which
amount
to
but
thirty
-
five
pound
a
year
,
I
make
over
to
the
orphan
and
widow
of
the
clergy
of
our
diocese
;
for
have
a
sufficient
fortune
of
my
own
,
I
be
careless
of
temporality
,
and
feel
a
secret
pleasure
in
do
my
duty
without
reward
.
<EOS>
I
also
set
a
resolution
of
keep
no
curate
,
and
of
be
acquaint
with
every
man
in
the
parish
,
exhort
the
married
man
to
temperance
and
the
bachelor
to
matrimony
;
so
that
in
a
few
year
it
be
a
common
saying
,
that
there
be
three
strange
want
at
Wakefield
,
a
parson
want
pride
,
young
man
want
wife
,
and
ale
-
house
want
customer
.
<EOS>
Matrimony
be
always
one
of
my
favourite
topic
,
and
I
write
several
sermon
to
prove
its
happiness
:
but
there
be
a
peculiar
tenet
which
I
make
a
point
of
support
;
for
I
maintain
with
Whiston
,
that
it
be
unlawful
for
a
priest
of
the
church
of
England
,
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
,
to
take
a
second
,
or
to
express
it
in
one
word
,
I
value
myself
upon
be
a
strict
monogamist
.
<EOS>
I
be
early
innitiate
into
this
important
dispute
,
on
which
so
many
laborious
volume
have
be
write
.
<EOS>
I
publish
some
tract
upon
the
subject
myself
,
which
,
as
they
never
sell
,
I
have
the
consolation
of
thinking
be
read
only
by
the
happy
Few
.
<EOS>
some
of
my
friend
call
this
my
weak
side
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
they
have
not
like
me
<EOS>
make
it
the
subject
of
long
contemplation
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
reflect
upon
it
,
the
more
important
it
appear
.
<EOS>
I
even
go
a
step
beyond
Whiston
in
display
my
principle
:
as
he
have
engraven
upon
his
wife
's
tomb
that
she
be
the
only
wife
of
William
Whiston
;
so
I
write
a
similar
epitaph
for
my
wife
,
though
still
live
,
in
which
I
extoll
her
prudence
,
oeconomy
,
and
obedience
till
death
;
and
have
get
it
copy
fair
,
with
an
elegant
frame
,
it
be
place
over
the
chimney
-
piece
,
where
it
answer
several
very
useful
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
admonish
my
wife
of
her
duty
to
me
,
and
my
fidelity
to
her
;
it
inspire
her
with
a
passion
for
fame
,
and
constantly
put
her
in
mind
of
her
end
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
thus
,
perhaps
,
from
hear
marriage
so
often
recommend
,
that
my
eld
son
,
just
upon
leave
college
,
fix
his
affection
upon
the
daughter
of
a
neighbour
clergyman
,
who
be
a
dignitary
in
the
church
,
and
in
circumstance
to
give
her
a
large
fortune
:
but
fortune
be
her
small
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
Miss
Arabella
Wilmot
be
allow
by
all
,
except
my
two
daughter
,
to
be
completely
pretty
.
<EOS>
Her
youth
,
health
,
and
innocence
,
be
still
heighten
by
a
complexion
so
transparent
,
and
such
an
happy
sensibility
of
look
,
as
even
age
could
not
gaze
on
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
as
Mr
Wilmot
know
that
I
could
make
a
very
handsome
settlement
on
my
son
,
he
be
not
averse
to
the
match
;
so
both
family
live
together
in
all
that
harmony
which
generally
precede
an
expect
alliance
.
<EOS>
be
convince
by
experience
that
the
day
of
courtship
be
the
most
happy
of
our
life
,
I
be
willing
enough
to
lengthen
the
period
;
and
the
various
amusement
which
the
young
couple
every
day
share
in
each
other
's
company
,
seem
to
encrease
their
passion
.
<EOS>
We
be
generally
awake
in
the
morning
by
music
,
and
on
fine
day
ride
a
hunting
.
<EOS>
the
hour
between
breakfast
and
dinner
the
lady
devote
to
dress
and
study
:
they
usually
read
a
page
,
and
then
gaze
at
themselves
in
the
glass
,
which
even
philosopher
may
own
often
present
the
page
of
great
beauty
.
<EOS>
at
dinner
my
wife
take
the
lead
;
for
as
she
always
insist
upon
carve
every
thing
herself
,
it
be
her
mother
's
way
,
she
give
us
upon
these
occasion
the
history
of
every
dish
.
<EOS>
when
we
have
dine
,
to
prevent
the
lady
leave
us
,
I
generally
order
the
table
to
be
remove
;
and
sometimes
,
with
the
music
master
's
assistance
,
the
girl
would
give
us
a
very
agreeable
concert
.
<EOS>
walk
out
,
drink
tea
,
country
dance
,
and
forfeit
,
shorten
the
rest
of
the
day
,
without
the
assistance
of
card
,
as
I
hate
all
manner
of
gaming
,
except
backgammon
,
at
which
my
old
friend
and
I
sometimes
take
a
two
-
penny
hit
.
<EOS>
nor
can
I
here
pass
over
an
ominous
circumstance
that
happen
the
last
time
we
play
together
<EOS>
:
I
only
want
to
fle
a
quatre
,
and
yet
I
throw
deuce
ace
five
time
run
.
<EOS>
some
month
be
elapse
in
this
manner
,
till
at
last
it
be
think
convenient
to
fix
a
day
for
the
nuptial
of
the
young
couple
,
who
seem
earnestly
to
desire
it
.
<EOS>
during
the
preparation
for
the
wedding
,
I
need
not
describe
the
busy
importance
of
my
wife
,
nor
the
sly
look
of
my
daughter
:
in
fact
,
my
attention
be
fix
on
another
object
,
the
complete
a
tract
which
I
intend
shortly
to
publish
in
defence
of
my
favourite
principle
.
<EOS>
as
I
look
upon
this
as
a
master
-
piece
both
for
argument
and
style
,
I
could
not
in
the
pride
of
my
heart
avoid
shew
it
to
my
old
friend
Mr
Wilmot
,
as
I
make
no
doubt
of
receive
his
approbation
;
but
not
till
too
late
I
discover
that
he
be
most
violently
attach
to
the
contrary
opinion
,
and
with
good
reason
;
for
he
be
at
that
time
actually
court
a
fourth
wife
.
<EOS>
this
,
as
may
be
expect
,
produce
a
dispute
attend
with
some
acrimony
,
which
threaten
to
interrupt
our
intend
alliance
:
but
on
the
day
before
that
appoint
for
the
ceremony
,

the
subject

It

manage
with
proper
spirit
on
both
side

he
assert
that
I
be
heterodox

I
retort
the
charge

he
reply

I
rejoin

controversy
be
hot

I
be
call
out
by
one
of
my
relation

who
,
with
a
face
of
concern

advise
me
to
give
up
the
dispute

wedding

how

I

relinquish
the
cause
of
truth

let
him
be
an
husband

very

my

your

I
be
unwilling

you

the
account

after

now
it
may
serve
to
moderate
your

I
suppose

your

enforce
the
necessity

dissemble
at

go
this

for
the
argument

I

here
retract
my

favour

<EOS>
It
would
be
endless
to
describe
the
different
sensation
of
both
family
when
I
divulge
the
news
of
our
misfortune
;
but
what
other
feel
be
slight
to
what
the
lover
appear
to
endure
.
<EOS>
Mr
Wilmot
,
who
seem
before
sufficiently
inclined
to
break
off
the
match
,
be
by
this
blow
soon
determine
:
one
virtue
he
have
in
perfection
,
which
be
prudence
,
too
often
the
only
one
that
be
leave
us
at
seventy
-
two

<EOS>
a
migration

<EOS>
the
fortunate
circumstance
of
our
life
be
generally
find
at
last
to
be
of
our
own
procuring
  
<EOS>
the
only
hope
of
our
family
now
be
,
that
the
report
of
our
misfortune
may
be
malicious
or
premature
:
but
a
letter
from
my
agent
in
town
soon
come
with
a
confirmation
of
every
particular
.
<EOS>
the
loss
of
fortune
to
myself
alone
would
have
be
trifle
;
the
only
uneasiness
I
feel
be
for
my
family
,
who
be
to
be
humble
without
an
education
to
render
them
callous
to
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
near
a
fortnight
have
pass
before
I
attempt
to
restrain
their
affliction
;
for
premature
consolation
be
but
the
remembrancer
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
during
this
interval
,
my
thought
be
employ
on
some
future
mean
of
support
them
;
and
at
last
a
small
cure
of
fifteen
pound
a
year
be
offer
me
in
a
distant
neighbourhood
,
where
I
could
still
enjoy
my
principle
without
molestation
.
<EOS>
with
this
proposal
I
joyfully
close
,
have
determine
to
encrease
my
salary
by
manage
a
little
farm
.
  
<EOS>
have
take
this
resolution
,
my
next
care
be
to
get
together
the
wreck
of
my
fortune
;
and
all
debt
collect
and
pay
,
out
of
fourteen
thousand
pound
we
have
but
<EOS>
four
hundred
remain
.
<EOS>
My
chief
attention
therefore
be
now
to
bring
down
the
pride
of
my
family
to
their
circumstance
;
for
I
well
know
that
aspire
beggary
be
wretchedness
itself
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
ignorant
,
my
child

"
cry
I
,
"
that
no
prudence
of
our
could
have
prevent
our
late
misfortune
;
but
prudence
may
do
much
in
disappoint
its
effect
.
<EOS>
We
be
now
poor
,
my
fondling
,
and
wisdom
bid
us
conform
to
our
humble
situation
.
<EOS>
let
us
then
,
without
repine
,
give
up
those
splendour
with
which
number
be
wretched
,
and
seek
in
humble
circumstance
that
peace
with
which
all
may
be
happy
.
<EOS>
the
poor
live
pleasantly
without
our
help
,
why
then
should
not
we
learn
to
live
without
theirs
.
<EOS>
no
,
my
child
,
let
us
from
this
moment
give
up
all
pretension
to
gentility
;
we
have
still
enough
leave
for
happiness
if
we
be
wise
,

let
us
draw
upon
content
for
the
deficiency
of
fortune

<EOS>
as
my
eld
son
be
breed
a
scholar
,
I
determine
to
send
him
to
town
,
where
his
ability
may
contribute
to
our
support
and
his
own
.
<EOS>
the
separation
of
friend
and
family
be
,
perhaps
,
one
of
the
most
distressful
circumstance
attendant
on
penury

day
soon
arrive
on
which
we
be
to
disperse

add

<EOS>
as
he
be
possest
of
integrity

honour
,
I
be
under
no
apprehension
from
throw
him
naked
into
the
amphitheatre
of
life
;
for
I
know
he
would
act
a
good
part
whether
vanquished

victorious

<EOS>
His
departure
only
prepare
the
way
for
our

arrive
a

afterwards

so
many
hour

tranquility

a
tear

scarce
fortitude
itself
could

besides
,
a
journey
of
seventy
mile
to
a
family
that
have
hitherto
never

above
ten
from
home
,
fill
us
with
apprehension

and
the
cry
of
the
poor

who
follow
us
for
some
mile

contribute
to
encrease
it

<EOS>
the
first
day
's
journey
bring
us
in
safety
within
thirty
mile
of
our
future
retreat
,
and
we
put
up
for
the
night
at
an
obscure
inn
in
a
village
by
the
way
.

when
we
be
shew
a

I
desire
the

to
let
us
have
his
company

encrease
the
bill
next
morning

the
whole
neighbourhood

my
landlord

live
within
a

mile
of
the
place

<EOS>
this
gentleman
he
describe
as
one
who
desire
to
know
little
more
of
the
world
than
its
pleasure
,
be
particularly
remarkable
for
his
attachment
to
the
fair
sex
.
<EOS>
He
observe
that
no
virtue
be
able
to
resist
his
art
and
assiduity
,
and
that
scarce
a
farmer
's
daughter
within
ten
mile
round
but
what
have
find
him
successful

faithless

though
this
account
give

be
prepare

leave
the
room

swear
that
he
would
be
satisfy
one
way

another
,
when
I
beg
the
landlord
would
introduce
me
to
a
stranger
of
so
much
charity

he
describe

with
this
he
comply

shew
in
a
gentleman

seem
to
be
about
thirty

His
person

have
something
short

dry

seem
not

understand
ceremony

despise
it

upon

leave

I
could
not
avoid
express
my
concern

offer
him
my
purse

present
demand

be
glad

conversation

which
be
at
once
pleasing

instructive

induce
me
to
wish
for
a
continuance
of
it

it
be
now
high
time
to
retire
and
take
refreshment
against
the
fatigue
of
the
follow
day

<EOS>
the
next
morning
we
all
set
forward
together
:
my
family
on
horseback
,
while
Mr
Burchell
,
our
new
companion
,
walk
along
the
foot
-
path
by
the
road
-
side
,
observe
,
with
a
smile
,
that
as
we
be
ill
mount
,
he
would
be
too
generous
to
attempt
leave
us
behind
.
<EOS>
as
the
flood
be
not
yet
subside
,
we
be
oblige
to
hire
a
guide
,
who
trot
on
before
,
Mr
Burchell
and
I
bring
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
We
lighten
the
fatigue
of
the
road
with
philosophical
dispute
,
which
he
seem
to
understand
perfectly
.
<EOS>
but
what
surprise
me
most
be
,
that
though
he
be
a
money-
borrower
,
he
defend
his
opinion
with
as
much
obstinacy
as
if
he
have
be
my
patron

He
now
and
then
also
inform
me
to
whom
the
different
seat
belong

lie
in
our
view

little
himself

so
universally
known

<EOS>
I
have
hear
Sir
William
Thornhill
represent
as
one
of
the
most
generous
,
yet
whimsical
,
man
in
the
kingdom
;
a
man
of
consumate
benevolence

"
something
,
perhaps
,
too
much
so

"
reply
Mr
Burchell
,
"
at
least
he
carry
benevolence
to
an
excess
when
young
;
for
his
passion
be
then
strong
,
and
as
they
all
be
upon
the
side
of
virtue

they
lead
it
up
to
a
romantic
extreme

He
early
begin
to
aim
at
the
qualification
of
the
soldier

scholar
;
be
soon
distinguish
in
the
army
and
have
some
reputation
among
man
of
learning

<EOS>
adulation
ever
follow
the
ambitious
;
for
such
alone
receive
most
pleasure
from
flattery
.
<EOS>
He
be
surround
with
crowd
,
who
shew
him
only
one
side
of
their
character
;
so
that
he
begin
to
lose
a
regard
for
private
interest
in
universal
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
love
all
mankind
;
for
fortune
prevent
him
from
know
that
there
be
rascal
.
<EOS>
physician
tell
us
of
a
disorder
in
which
the
whole
body
be
so
exquisitely
sensible
,
that
the
slight
touch
give
pain
:
what
some
have
thus
suffer
in

this

feel
in
his

<EOS>
the
slight
distress
,
whether
real

fictitious
,
touch
him
to
the
quick
,
and
his
soul
labour
under
a
sickly
sensibility
of
the
misery
of
other

<EOS>
thus
disposed
to
relieve
,
it
will
be
easily
conjecture
,
he
find
number
dispose
to
solicit
:
his
profusion
begin
to
impair
his
fortune
,
but
not
his
good

nature
;
that
,
indeed
,
be
see
to
encrease
as
the
other
seem
to
decay
:
he
grow
improvident
as
he
grow
poor
;
and
though
he
talk
like
a
man
of
sense
,
his
action
be
those
of
a
fool

<EOS>
still
,
however
,
be
surround
with
importunity
,
and
no
longer
able
to
satisfy
every
request
that
be
make
him
,
instead
of
money
he
give
promise
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
he
have
to
bestow
,
and
he
have
not
resolution
enough
to
give
any
man
pain
by
a
denial
.
<EOS>
by
this
he
draw
round
him
crowd
of
dependant
,
whom
he
be
sure
to
disappoint
;
yet
wish
to
relieve

<EOS>
these
hang
upon
him
for
a
time
,
and
leave
him
with
merited
reproach
and
contempt

but
in
proportion
as
he
become
contemptable
to
other
,
he
become
despicable
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
mind
have
lean
upon
their
adulation
,
and
that
support
take
away
,
he
could
find
no
pleasure
in
the
applause
of
his
heart
,
which
he
have
never
learn
to
reverence
.
<EOS>
the
world
now
begin
to
wear
a
different
aspect
;
the
flattery
of
his
friend
begin
to
dwindle
into
simple
approbation
.
<EOS>
approbation
soon
take
the
more
friendly
form
of
advice
,
and
advice
when
reject
produce
their
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
now
,
therefore
find
that
such
friend
as
benefit
have
gather
round
him
,
be
little
estimable
:
he
now
find
that
a
man
's
own
heart
must
be
ever
give
to
gain
that
of
another
.
<EOS>
I
now
find
,
that
 
that
 
I
forget
what
I
be
go
to
observe
:
in
short
,
sir
,
he
resolve
to
respect
himself
,
and
lay
down
a
plan
of
restore
his
fall
fortune
.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
in
his
own
whimsical
manner
he
travel
through
Europe
on
foot
,
and
now
,
though
he
have
scarce
attain
the
age
of
thirty
,
his
circumstance
be
more
affluent
than
ever
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
his
bounty
be
more
rational
and
moderate
than
before
;
but
still
he
preserve
the
character
of
an
humourist
,
and
find
most
pleasure
in
eccentric
virtue
.

My
attention
be
so
much
take
up
by
Mr
Burchell
's
account
,
<EOS>
that
I
scarce
look
forward
as
we
go
along
,
til
we
be
alarm
by
the
cry
of
my
family
<EOS>
,
when
turn
,
I
perceive
my
young
daughter
in
the
midst
of
a
rapid
stream
,
throw
from
her
horse
,
and
struggle
with
the
torrent
.
<EOS>
She
have
sink
twice
,
nor
be
it
in
my
power
to
disengage
myself
in
time
to
bring
her
relief
.
<EOS>
My
sensation
be
even
too
violent
to
permit
my
attempt
her
rescue
:
she
must
have
certainly
perish
have
not
my
companion
,
perceive
her
danger
,
instantly
plunge
in
to
her
relief
,
and
with
some
difficulty
,
bring
her
in
safety
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
by
take
the
current
a
little
farther
up
,
the
rest
of
the
family
get
safely
over
;
where
we
have
an
opportunity
of
join
our
acknowledgment
to
her
's
.
<EOS>
Her
gratitude
may
be
more
readily
imagine
than
describe
:
she
thank
her
deliverer
more
with
look
than
word
,
and
continue
to
lean
upon
his
arm
,
as
if
still
willing
to
receive
assistance
.
<EOS>
My
wife
also
hope
one
day
to
have
the
pleasure
of
return
his
kindness
at
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
thus
,
after
we
be
refresh
at
the
next
inn
,
and
have
dine
together
,
as
Mr
Burchell
be
go
to
a
different
part
of
the
country
,
he
take
leave
;
and
we
pursue
our
journey
.
<EOS>
My
wife
observe
as
we
go
,
that
she
like
him
extremely
,
and
protest
,
that
if
he
have
birth
and
fortune

entitle
him
to
match
into
such
a
family
as
our

she
know
no
man
she
would
sooner
fix
upon
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
smile
to
hear
her
talk
in
this
lofty
strain
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
never
much
displeased
with
those
harmless
delusion
that
tend
to
make
us
more
happy

<EOS>

<EOS>
the

of
farmer

who

their

and
be
equal
stranger

opulence
and
poverty

<EOS>
as
they
have
almost
all
the
conveniencie
of
life
within
themselves
,
they
seldom
visit
town
or
city
in
search
of
superfluity

<EOS>
remote
from
the
polite

they
still
retain
the
primaeval
simplicity
of
manner

and
frugal
by
habit

they
scarce
know
that
temperance
be
a
virtue

<EOS>
They
work
with
cheerfulness
on
day
of
labour
;
but
observe
festival
as
interval
of
idleness
and
pleasure

They

<EOS>
nothing
could
exceed
the
neatness

inexpressible
beauty

My

the
fire
be
previously
kindle
by
the
servant
.
<EOS>
after
we
have
salute
each
other
with
proper
ceremony

for
I
always
think
fit
to
keep
up
some
mechanical
form
of
good
breeding
,
without
which
freedom
ever
destroy
friendship

we

<EOS>
this

breakfast

which
be

ready
at
a
certain
time

<EOS>
I
allow
half
an
hour
for
this
meal
,
and
an
hour
for
dinner
;
which
time
be
take
up
in
innocent
mirth
between
my
wife
and
daughter
,
and
in
philosophical
argument
between
my
son
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
rise
with
the
sun
,
so
we
never
pursue
our
labour
after
it
be
go
down
,
but
return
home
to
the
expect
family
;
where
smile

a
treat
hearth

and
pleasant
fire

be
prepare
for
our
reception

<EOS>
nor
be
we
without
guest
:
sometimes
farmer
Flamborough
,
our
talkative
neighbour
,
and
often
the
blind
piper
,
would
pay
us
a
visit
,
and
taste
our
gooseberry
wine
;
for
the
making
of
which
we
have
lose
neither
the
receipt
nor
the
reputation
.
<EOS>
these
harmless
people
have
several
way
of
be
good
company
,
while
one
play
,
the
other
would
sing
some
soothe
ballad
,
Johnny
Armstrong
's
last
good
night
,
or
the
cruelty
of
Barbara
Allen
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
conclude
in
the
manner
we
begin
the
morning
,
my
young
boy
be
appoint
to
read
the
lesson
of
the
day
,
and
he
that
read
loud
,
distinct
,
and
good
,
be
to
have
an
half
-
penny
on
Sunday
to
put
in
the
poor
's
box
.
  
<EOS>
when
Sunday
come
,
it
be
indeed
a
day
of
finery
,
which
all
my
sumptuary
edict
could
not
restrain
.
<EOS>
how
well
so
ever
I
fancy
my
lecture
against
pride
<EOS>
have
conquer
the
vanity
of
my
daughter
;
yet
I
still
find
them
secretly
attach
to
all
their
former
finery
<EOS>
:
they
still
love
lace
,
ribband
,
bugle
and
catgut
;
my
wife
herself
retain
a
passion
for
her
crimson
paduasoy
,
because
I
formerly
happen
to
say
it
become
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
Sunday
in
particular
their
behaviour
serve
to
mortify
me
:
I
have
desire
my
girl
the
precede
night
to
be
drest
early
the
next
day
;
for
I
always
love
to
be
at
church
a
good
while
before
the
rest
of
the
congregation
.
<EOS>
They
punctually
obey
my
direction
;
but
when
we
be
to
assemble
in
the
morning
at
breakfast
,
down
come
my
wife
and
daughter
,
drest
out
in
all
their
former
splendour
:
their
hair
plaistere
up
with
pomatum
,
their
face
patch
to
taste
,
their
train
bundle
up
into
an
heap
behind
,
and
rustle
at
every
motion
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
smile
at
their
vanity
,
particularly
that
of
my
wife
,
from
whom
I
expect
more
discretion
.
<EOS>
in
this
exigence
,
therefore
,
my
only
resource
be
to
order
my
son
,
with
an
important
air
,
to
call
our
coach
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
amazed
at
the
command
;
but
I
repeat
it
with
more
solemnity
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
surely
,
my
dear
,
you
jest
,
"
cry
my
wife
,
"
we
can
walk
it
perfectly
well
:
we
want
no
coach
to
carry
us
now
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
,
child
,
"
return
I
,
"
we
do
want
a
coach
;
for
if
we
walk
to
church
in
this
trim
,
the
very
child
in
the
parish
will
hoot
after
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
reply
my
wife
,
"
I
always
imagine
that
my
Charles
be
fond
of
see
his
child
neat
and
handsome
about
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
as
neat
as
you
please
,
"
interrupt
I
,
"
and
I
shall
love
you
the
well
for
it
,
but
all
this
be
not
neatness
,
but
frippery
.
<EOS>
these
ruffling
,
and
pinking
,
and
patching
,
will
only
make
us
hate
by
all
the
wife
of
all
our
neighbour
.
<EOS>
no
,
my
child
,
"
continue
I
,
more
gravely
,
"
those
gown
may
be
alter
into
something
of
a
plainer
cut
;
for
finery
be
very
unbecoming
in
us
,
who
want
the
mean
of
decency
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
such
flouncing
and
shredding
be
become
even
in
the
rich
,
if
we
consider
,
upon
a
moderate
calculation
,
that
the
nakedness
of
the
indigent
world
may
be
cloathe
from
the
trimming
of
the
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
remonstrance
have
the
proper
effect
;
they
go
with
great
composure
,
that
very
instant
,
to
change
their
dress
;
and
the
next
day
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
find
my
daughter
,
at
their
own
request
employ
in
cut
up
their
train
into
Sunday
waistcoat
for
Dick
and
Bill
,
the
two
little
one
,
and
what
be
still
more
satisfactory
,
the
gown
seem
improve
by
this
curtailing
.
    
<EOS>
a
new
and
great
acquaintance
introduce
.
<EOS>
what
we
place
most
hope
upon
,
generally
prove
most
fatal
  
<EOS>
at
a
small
distance
from
the
house
my
predecessor
have
make
a
seat
,
overshade
by
an
hedge
of
hawthorn
and
honeysuckle
.
<EOS>
here
,
when
the
weather
be
fine
,
and
our
labour
soon
finish
,
we
usually
sate
together
,
to
enjoy
an
extensive
landschape
,
in
the
calm
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
here
too
we
drink
tea
,
which
now
be
become
an
occasional
banquet
;
and
as
we
have
it
but
<EOS>
seldom
,
it
diffuse
a
new
joy
,
the
preparation
for
it
be
make
with
no
small
share
of
bustle
and
ceremony
.
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
,
our
two
little
one
always
read
for
us
,
and
they
be
regularly
serve
after
we
have
do
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
to
give
a
variety
to
our
amusement
,
the
girl
sing
to
the
guitar
;
and
while
they
thus
form
a
little
concert
,
my
wife
and
I
would
stroll
down
the
sloping
field
,
that
be
embellish
with
blue
bell
and
centaury
,
talk
of
our
child
with
rapture
,
and
enjoy
the
breeze
that
waft
both
health
and
harmony
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
we
begin
to
find
that
every
situation
in
life
may
bring
its
own
peculiar
pleasure
:
every
morning
wake
us
to
a
repetition
of
toil
;
but
the
evening
repay
it
with
vacant
hilarity
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
beginning
of
autumn
,
on
a
holiday
,
for
I
keep
such
as
interval
of
relaxation
from
labour
,
that
I
have
draw
out
my
family
to
our
usual
place
of
amusement
,
and
our
young
musician
begin
their
usual
concert
.
<EOS>
as
we
be
thus
engage
,
we
see
a
stag
bind
nimbly
by
,
within
about
twenty
pace
of
where
we
be
sit
,
and
by
its
panting
,
it
seem
pr
by
the
hunter
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
much
time
to
reflect
upon
the
poor
animal
's
distress
,
when
we
perceive
the
dog
and
horseman
come
sweep
along
at
some
distance
behind
,
and
make
the
very
path
it
have
take
.
<EOS>
I
be
instantly
for
return
in
with
my
family
;
but
either
curiosity
or
surprize
,
or
some
more
hidden
motive
,
hold
my
wife
and
daughter
to
their
seat
.
<EOS>
the
huntsman
,
who
ride
foremost
,
past
us
with
great
swiftness
,
follow
by
four
or
five
person
more
,
who
seem
in
equal
haste
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
a
young
gentleman
of
a
more
genteel
appearance
than
the
rest
,
come
forward
,
and
for
a
while
regard
us
,
instead
of
pursue
the
chace
,
stopt
short
,
and
give
his
horse
to
a
servant
who
attend
,
approach
us
with
a
careless
superior
air
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
want
no
introduction
,
but
be
go
to
salute
my
daughter
as
one
certain
of
a
kind
reception
;
but
they
have
early
learn
the
lesson
of
looking
presumption
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
let
us
know
that
his
name
be
Thornhill
,
and
that
he
be
owner
of
the
estate
that
lie
for
some
extent
round
us
.
<EOS>
He
again
,
therefore
,
offer
to
salute
the
female
part
of
the
family
,
and
such
be
the
power
of
fortune
and
fine
cloath
,
that
he
find
no
second
repulse
.
<EOS>
as
his
address
,
though
confident
,
be
easy
,
we
soon
become
more
familiar
;
and
perceive
musical
instrument
lie
near
,
he
beg
to
be
favour
with
a
song
.
<EOS>
as
I
do
not
approve
of
such
disproportione
acquaintance
,
I
wink
upon
my
daughter
in
order
to
prevent
their
compliance
;
but
my
hint
be
counteract
by
one
from
their
mother
;
so
that
with
a
chearful
air
they
give
us
,
a
favourite
song
of
Dryden
's
.
<EOS>
Mr
Thornhill
seem
highly
delighted
with
their
performance
and
choice
,
and
then
take
up
the
guitar
himself
.
<EOS>
He
play
but
very
indifferently
;
however
,
my
eld
daughter
repay
his
former
applause
with
interest
,
and
assure
him
that
his
tone
be
loud
than
even
those
of
her
master
.
<EOS>
at
this
compliment
he
bow
,
which
she
return
with
a
curtesy
.
<EOS>
He
praise
her
taste
,
and
she
commend
his
understanding
:
an
age
could
not
have
make
them
better
acquaint
.
<EOS>
while
the
fond
mother
too
,
equally
happy
,
insist
upon
her
landlord
's
step
in
,
and
taste
a
glass
of
her
gooseberry
.
<EOS>
the
whole
family
seem
earnest
to
please
him
:
my
girl
attempt
to
entertain
him
with
topic
they
think
most
modern
,
while
Moses
,
on
the
contrary
,
give
him
a
question
or
two
from
the
ancient
,
for
which
he
have
the
satisfaction
of
be
laugh
at
:
my
little
one
be
no
less
busy
,
and
fondly
stick
close
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
all
my
endeavour
could
scarce
keep
their
dirty
finger
from
handle
and
tarnish
the
lace
on
his
cloath
,
and
lift
up
the
flap
of
his
pocket
hole
,
to
see
what
be
there
.
<EOS>
at
the
approach
of
evening
he
take
leave
;
but
not
till
he
have
request
permission
to
renew
his
visit
,
which
,
as
he
be
our
landlord
,
we
most
readily
agree
to
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
go
,
my
wife
call
a
council
on
the
conduct
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
be
of
opinion
,
that
it
be
a
most
fortunate
hit
;
for
that
she
have
know
even
strange
thing
at
last
bring
to
bear
.
<EOS>
She
hope
again
to
see
the
day
in
which
we
may
hold
up
our
head
with
the
good
of
them
;
and
conclude
,
she
protest
she
could
see
no
reason
why
the
two
Miss
Wrinklers
should
marry
great
fortune
,
and
her
child
get
none
.
<EOS>
as
this
last
argument
be
direct
to
me
,
I
protest
I
could
see
no
reason
for
it
neither
,
nor
why
Mr
Simpkins
get
the
ten
thousand
pound
prize
in
the
lottery
,
and
we
sate
down
with
a
blank
.
<EOS>
"
I
protest
,
Charles
,
"
cry
my
wife
,
"
this
be
the
way
you
always
damp
my
girl
and
me
when
we
be
in
spirit
.
<EOS>
tell
me
,
Sophy
,
my
dear
,
what
do
you
think
of
our
new
visitor
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
he
seem
to
be
good-
natured
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
immensely
so
,
indeed
,
Mamma
,
"
reply
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
have
a
great
deal
to
say
upon
every
thing
,
and
be
never
at
a
loss
;
and
the
more
trifle
the
subject
,
the
more
he
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
"
cry
Olivia
,
"
he
be
well
enough
for
a
man
;
but
for
my
part
,
I
do
not
much
like
him
,
he
be
so
extremely
impudent
and
familiar
;
but
on
the
guitar
he
be
shocking
.
<EOS>
"
these
two
last
speech
I
interpret
by
contrary
.
<EOS>
I
find
by
this
,
that
Sophia
internally
despise
,
as
much
as
Olivia
secretly
admire
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
whatever
may
be
your
opinion
of
him
,
my
child
,
"
cry
I
,
"
to
confess
a
truth
,
he
have
not
prepossest
me
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
disproportione
friendship
ever
terminate
in
disgust
;
and
I
think
,
notwithstanding
all
his
ease
,
that
he
seem
perfectly
sensible
of
the
distance
between
us
.
<EOS>
let
us
keep
to
companion
of
our
own
rank
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
character
more
contemptible
than
a
man
that
be
a
fortune
-
hunter
,
and
I
can
see
no
reason
why
fortune-
hunt
woman
should
not
be
contemptible
too
.
<EOS>
thus
,
at
best
,
we
shall
be
contemptible
if
his
view
be
honourable
;
but
if
they
be
otherwise
!
<EOS>
I
should
shudder
but
<EOS>
to
think
of
that
!
<EOS>
It
be
true
<EOS>
I
have
no
apprehension
from
the
conduct
of
my
child
,
but
I
think
there
be
some
from
his
character
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
proceed
,
but
for
the
interruption
of
a
servant
from
the
"
Squire
,
who
,
with
his
compliment
,
send
us
a
side
of
venison
,
and
a
promise
to
dine
with
us
some
day
after
.
<EOS>
this
well
-
time
present
plead
more
powerfully
in
his
favour
,
than
any
thing
I
have
to
say
could
obviate
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
continue
silent
,
satisfied
with
just
have
point
out
danger
,
and
leave
it
to
their
own
discretion
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
that
virtue
which
require
to
be
ever
guard
,
be
scarce
worth
the
centinel
.
    
<EOS>
the
happiness
of
a
country
fire
-
side
  
<EOS>
as
we
carry
on
the
former
dispute
with
some
degree
of
warmth
,
in
order
to
accommodate
matter
,
it
be
universally
agree
,
that
we
should
have
a
part
of
the
venison
for
supper
,
and
the
girl
undertake
the
task
with
alacrity
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
"
cry
I
,
"
that
we
have
no
neighbour
or
stranger
to
take
a
part
in
this
good
cheer

<EOS>
feast
of
this
kind
acquire
a
double
relish
from
hospitality

<EOS>
"
  
"

cry
my

"
here
come

good
friend
Mr
Burchell

you
down
fairly

the
argument

me
in
argument

I.
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
there
,
my
dear

<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
but
few
that
can
do
that
:
I
never
dispute
your
ability
at
make
a

I
beg
you
will
leave
argument
to
me

"
 
<EOS>
as
I
speak
,
poor
Mr
Burchell
enter
the
house
,
and
be
welcome
by
the
family
,
who
shake
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
while
little
Dick
officiously
reach
him
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
with
the
poor
man
's
friendship
for
two
reason
;
because
I
know
that
he
want
mine
,
and
I
know
him
to
be
friendly
as
far
as
he
be
able
.
<EOS>
He
be
know
in
our
neighbourhood
by
the
character
of
the
poor
Gentleman
that
would
do
no
good
when
he
be
young
,
though
he
be
not
yet
thirty
.
<EOS>
He
would
at
interval
talk
with
great
good
sense
;
but
in
general
he
be
fond
of
the
company
of
child
,
whom
he
use
to
call
harmless
little
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
famous
,
I
find
,
for
singe
them
ballad
,
and
tell
them
story
;
and
seldom
go
out
without
something
in
his
pocket
for
them
,
a
piece
of
gingerbread
,
or
an
halfpenny
whistle
.
<EOS>
He
generally
come
for
a
few
day
into
our
neighbourhood
once
a
year
,
and
live
upon
the
neighbour
hospitality
.
<EOS>
He
sate
down
to
supper
among
us
,
and
my
wife
be
not
spare
of
her
gooseberry
wine
.
<EOS>
the
tale
go
round
;
he
sing
us
old
song
,
and
give
the
child
the
story
of
the
Buck
of
Beverland
,
with
the
history
of
Patient
Grissel
,
the
adventure
of
Catskin
,
and
then
Fair
Rosamond
's
bower
.
<EOS>
Our
cock
,
which
always
crew
at
eleven
,
now
tell
us
it
be
time
for
repose
;
but
an
unforeseen
difficulty
start
about
lodge
the
stranger
:
all
our
bed
be
already
take
up
,
and
it
be
too
late
to
send
him
to
the
next
alehouse
.
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
little
Dick
offer
him
his
part
of
the
bed
,
if
his
brother
Moses
would
let
him
lie
with
him
;
"
and
I
,
"
cry
Bill
,
"
will
give
Mr
Burchell
my
part
,
if
my
sister
will
take
me
to
theirs

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
do
,
my
good
child

"
cry
I
<EOS>
,
"
hospitality
be
one
of
the

christian
duty

<EOS>
the
beast
retire
to
its
shelter
,
and
the
bird
fly
to
its
nest
;

helpless
man
can
only
find
refuge
from
his

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
He
never

<EOS>
Deborah

my

"
cry
I
,
to
my
wife
,
"
give
those
boy
a
lump
of
sugar
each
,
and
let
Dick
's
be
the
large
,
because
he
speak
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
early
I
call
out
my
whole
family
to
help
at
save
an
after
-
growth
of
hay
,
and
,
our
guest
offer
his
assistance
,
he
be
accept
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
Our
labour
go
on
lightly
,
we
turn
the
swath
to
the
wind
,
I
go
foremost
,
and
the
rest
follow
in
due
succession
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
avoid
,
however
,
observe
the
assiduity
of
Mr
Burchell
in
assist
my
daughter
Sophia
in
her
part
of
the
task
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
his
own
,
he
would
join
in
her
's
,
and
enter
into
a
close
conversation
:
but
I
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
Sophia
's
understanding
,
and
be
too
well
convinced
of
her
ambition
,
to
be
under
any
uneasiness
from
a
man
of
broken
fortune
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
finish
for
the
day
,
Mr
Burchell
be
invite
as
on
the
night
before
;
but
he
refuse
,
as
he
be
to
lie
that
night
at
a
neighbour
's
,
to
whose
child
he
be
carry
a
whistle
.
<EOS>
when
go
,
our
conversation
at
supper
turn
upon
our
late
unfortunate
guest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
strong
instance
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
that
poor
man
of
the
misery
attend
a
youth
of
levity
and
extravagance
.
<EOS>
He
by
no
means
want
sense
,
which
only
serve
to
aggravate
his
former
folly
.
<EOS>
poor
forlorn
creature
,
where
be
now
the
reveller
,
the
flatterer
,
that
he
could
once
inspire
and
command
!
<EOS>
go
,
perhaps
,
to
attend
the
bagnio
pander
,
grow
rich
by
his
extravagance
.
<EOS>
They
once
praise
him
,
and
now
they
applaud
the
pander
:
their
former
rapture
at
his
wit
,
be
now
convert
into
sarcasm
at
his
folly
:
he
be
poor
,
and
perhaps
deserve
poverty
;
for
he
have
neither
the
ambition
to
be
independent
,
nor
the
skill
to
be
useful
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
prompt
,
perhaps
,
by
some
secret
reason
,
I
deliver
this
observation
with
too
much
acrimony
,
which
my
Sophia
gently
reprove
.
<EOS>
"
whatsoever
his
former
conduct
may
be
,
pappa
,
his
circumstance
should
exempt
him
from
censure
now
.
<EOS>
His
present
indigence
be
a
sufficient
punishment
for
former
folly
;
and
I
have
hear
my
pappa
himself
say
,
that
we
should
never
strike
our
unnecessary
blow
at
a
victim
over
whom
providence
hold
the
scourge
of
its
resentment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
Sophy
,
"
cry
my
son
Moses
,
"

one
of
the
ancient
finely
represent
so
malicious
a
conduct

attempt

a
rustic
to
flay
Marsyas

whose
skin

,
the
fable
tell

stript
off

<EOS>
besides
,
I
do
not
know
if
this
poor
man
's
situation
be
so
bad
as
my
father
would
represent
it
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
to
judge
of
the
feeling
of
other
by
what
we
may
feel
if
in
their
place
.
<EOS>
however
dark
the
habitation
of
the
mole
to
our
eye
,
yet
the
animal
itself
find
the
apartment
sufficiently
lightsome
.
<EOS>
and
to
confess
a
truth
,
this
man
's
mind
seem
fit
to
his
station
;
for
I
never
hear
any
one
more
sprightly
than
he
be
to
-
day
,
when
he
converse
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
say
without
the
least
design
,
however
it
excite
a
blush
,
which
she
strove
to
cover
by
an
affected
laugh
,
assure
him
,
that
she
scarce
take
any
notice
of
what
he
say
to
her
;
but
that
she
believe
he
may
once
have
be
a
very
fine
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
readiness
with
which
she
undertake
to
vindicate
herself
,
and
her
blushing
,
be
symptom
I
do
not
internally
approve
;
but
I
represt
my
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
expect
our
landlord
the
next
day
,
my
wife
go
to
make
the
venison
pasty
;
Moses
sate
reading
,
while
I
teach
the
little
one
:
my
daughter
seem
equally
busy
with
the
rest
;
and
I
observe
them
for
a
good
while
cook
something
over
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
at
first
suppose
they
be
assist
their
mother
;
but
little
Dick
inform
me
in
a
whisper
,
that
they
be
make
a
wash
for
the
face
.
<EOS>
wash
of
all
kind
I
have
a
natural
antipathy
to
;
for
I
know
that
instead
of
mend
the
complexion
they
spoil
it
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
approach
my
chair
by
sly
degree
to
the
fire
,
and
grasp
the
poker
,
as
if
it
want
mending
,
seemingly
by
accident
,
overturn
the
whole
composition
,
and
it
be
too
late
to
begin
another

the
dull
fellow
may

night

two

when
the
morning
arrive
on
which
we
be
to
entertain
our
young
landlord
,
it
may
be
easily
suppose
what
provision
be
exhaust
to
make
an
appearance
.
<EOS>
It
may
also
be
conjecture
that
my
wife
and
daughter
expand
their
gay
plumage
upon
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr
Thornhill
come
with
a
couple
of
friend

his
chaplain

and
feeder

<EOS>
the
servant

in
the
triumph
of
her
heart

insist
on

them
all

for
which
,
by
the

our

Mr

heartiness
of
his
reception

in
some
measure

relieve
our
embarrasment

for
one
of
the

Mr
Thornhill

<EOS>
this
effectually
raise
the
laugh
against
poor
Moses
,
who
sate
the
only
dismal
figure
in
a
groupe
of
merry
face
:
nor
,
do
he
offer
a
single
syllable
more
during
the
whole
entertainment

<EOS>
but
though
all
this
give
me
no
pleasure

it
have
a
very
different
effect
upon
Olivia

who
mistake
it
for
humour

though
<EOS>
but
a
mere
act
of
the
memory
.
<EOS>
She
think
him
therefore
a
very
fine
gentleman

such
as
consider
what
powerful
ingredient
a
good
figure
,
fine
cloath
,

fortune

easily

<EOS>
Mr
Thornhill
,
notwithstanding
his
real
ignorance
,
talk
with
ease
,
and
could
expatiate
upon
the
common
topic
of
conversation
with
fluency
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
surprising
then
that
such
talent
should
win
the
affection
of
a
girl
,
who
by
education
be
teach
to
value
an
appearance
in
herself
,
and
consequently
to
set
a
value
upon
it
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
upon
his
departure
,
we
again
enter
into
a
debate
upon
the
merit
of
our
young
landlord
.
<EOS>
as
he
direct
his
look
and
conversation
to
Olivia
,
it
be
no
longer
doubt
but
that
she
be
the
object
that
induce
him
to
be
our
visitor
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
seem
to
be
much
displeased
at
the
innocent
raillery
of
her
brother
and
sister
upon
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
even
Deborah
herself
seem
to
share
the
glory
of
the
day
,
and
exult
in
her
daughter
's
victory
as
if
it
be
her
own
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
she
to
me
,
"
I
will
fairly
own
,
that
it
be
I
that
instruct
my
girl
to
encourage
our
landlord
's
address
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
some
ambition
,
and
you
now
see
that
I
be
right
;
for
who
know
how
this
may
end
?
"
<EOS>
"
ay
,
who
know
that
indeed
,
"
answer
I
,
with
a
groan
:
"
for
my
part
I
do
not
much
like
it
;
and
I
could
have
be
better
pleased
with
one
that
be
poor
and
honest
,
than
this
fine
gentleman
with
his
fortune
and
infidelity
;
for
depend
on't
,
if
he
be
what
I
suspect
him
,
no
free-
thinker
shall
ever
have
a
child
of
mine

<EOS>
"
sure
,
father
,
"
cry
Moses

"
you
be
too
severe
in
this
;
for
heaven
will
never
arraign
him
for
what
he
think
,
but
for
what
he
do
.
<EOS>
every
man
have
a
thousand
vicious
thought
,
which
arise
without
his
power
to
suppress

<EOS>
think
freely
of
religion

may
be
involuntary
with
this

so
<EOS>
that
allow
his
sentiment
to
be
wrong
,
yet
as
he
be
purely
passive
in
his
assent
,
he
be
no
more
to
be
blame
for
his
error
than
the
governor
of
a
city
without
wall

shelter
he

to
afford
an
invade
enemy

<EOS>

<EOS>

true

I

if
the

invite
the
enemy

there
he

justly
culpable

such
be
always
the
case
with
those
who
embrace
error

<EOS>
the
vice
do
not
lie
in
assent
to
the
proofs
they
see
;
but
in
be
blind
to
many
of
the
proof
that
offer
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
though
our
erroneous
opinion
be
involuntary
when
form
,
yet
as
we
have
be
wilfully
corrupt
,
or
very
negligent
in
form
them
,
we
deserve
punishment
for
our
vice
,
or
contempt
for
our
folly

<EOS>
"
My
wife
now
keep
up
the
conversation
,
though
not
the
argument
:
she
observe
,
that
several
very
prudent
man
of

thinker

make
very
good
husband

<EOS>
the
next
morning
we
be
again
visit
by
Mr
Burchell
,
though
I
begin
,
for
certain
reason
,
to
be
displease
with
the
frequency
of
his
return
;
but
I
could
not
refuse
him
my
company
and
fire
-
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
his
labour
more
than
requite
his
entertainment
;
for
he
work
among
us
with
vigour
,
and
either
in
the
meadow
or
at
the
hay
-
rick
put
himself
foremost
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
have
always
something
amusing
to
say
that
lessen
our
toil
,
and
be
at
once
so
out
of
the
way
,
and
yet
so
sensible
,
that
I
love
,
laugh
at
,
and
pity
him
.
<EOS>
My
only
dislike
arise
from
an
attachment
he
discover
to
my
daughter
:
he
would
,
in
a
jesting
manner
,
call
her
his
little
mistress
,
and
when
he
buy
each
of
the
girl
a
set
of
ribband
,
hers
be
the
fine
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
,
but
he
every
day
seem
to
become
more
amiable
,
his
wit
to
improve
,
and
his
simplicity
to
assume
the
superior
air
of
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
Our
family
dine
in
the
field
,
and
we
sate
,
or
rather
reclined
,
round
a
temperate
repast
,
our
cloth
spread
upon
the
hay
,
while
Mr
Burchell
give
cheerfulness
to
the
feast
.
<EOS>
to
heighten
our
satisfaction
two
blackbird
answer
each
other
from
opposite
hedge
,
the
familiar
redbreast
come
and
peck
the
crumb
from
our
hand
,
and
every
sound
seem
but
the
echo
of
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
sit
thus

Sophia

<EOS>
I
think
of
the
two
lover
,
so
sweetly
describe
by
Mr
Gay
,
who
be
strike
dead
in
each
other
's
arm

<EOS>
there
be
something
so
pathetic
in
the
description
,
that
I
have
read
it
an
hundred
time
with
new
rapture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
my
opinion
,
"
cry
my
son
,
"
the
fine
stroke
in
that
description
be
much
below
those
in
the
Acis
and
Galatea
of
Ovid
.
<EOS>
the
roman
poet
understand
the
use
of
contrast
well

upon
that
figure
artfully
manage
all
strength

pathetic
depend

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
remarkable
,
"
cry
Mr
Burchell
,
"
that
both
the
poet
you
mention
have
equally
contribute
to
introduce
a
false
taste
into
their
respective
country

by
load
all
their
line
with

<EOS>

perhaps
,

I
thus
reprehend

you
will
think
it
just
that
I
should
give
them
an
opportunity

indeed
I
have
make
this
remark

to
have
an

to

startle
my

fright
have
throw

She
be
go

a
private
look

soon
induce

correct

that

make

of
the

<EOS>
I
suspect

however

with
more
probability
,
that
her
affection
be
place

<EOS>
the

errand
be

I

to

Mr

return

compliment

her
up

add
that
he
be
to
go
that
night
five
mile

invite
to
an
harvest
supper

<EOS>
His
refusal
appear
to
me
a
little
extraordinary
,
nor
could
I
conceive
how
so
sensible
a
girl
as
my
young

could
thus
prefer
a
man
of
broken
fortune
to
one
whose
expectation
be
much
great

as
man
be
most
capable

distinguish
merit

<EOS>
Mr
Burchell
have
scarce
take
leave
,
and
Sophia
consent
to
dance
with
the
chaplain
,
when
my
little
one
come
run
out
to
tell
us
that
the
"
Squire
be
come
,
with
a
crowd
of
company
.
<EOS>
upon
our
return
,
we
find
our
landlord
,
with
a
couple
of
under
gentleman
and
two
young
lady
richly
dr
,
whom
he
introduce
as
woman
of
very
great
distinction
and
fashion
from
town
.
<EOS>
We
happen
not
to
have
chair
enough
for
the
whole
company
;
but
Mr
Thornhill
immediately
propose
that
every
gentleman
should
sit
in
a
lady
's
lap
.
<EOS>
this
I
positively
object
to
,
notwithstanding
a
look
of
disapprobation
from
my
wife
.
<EOS>
Moses
be
therefore
dispatch
to
borrow
a
couple
of
chair
;
and
as
we
be
in
want
of
lady
to
make
up
a
set
at
country
dance
,
the
two
gentleman
go
with
him
in
quest
of
a
couple
of
partner
.
<EOS>
chair
and
partner
be
soon
provide
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
return
with
my
neighbour
Flamborough
's
rosy
daughter
,
flaunt
with
red
top
-
knot
,
but
an
unlucky
circumstance
be
not
advert
to
;
though
the
Miss
Flamboroughs
be
reckon
the
very
good
dancer
in
the
parish
,
and
understand
the
jig
and
the
round
-
about
to
perfection
;
yet
they
be
totally
unacquainted
with
country
dance
.
<EOS>
"
this
at
first
discompose
us
:
however
,
after
a
little
shoving
and
drag
,
they
at
last
go
merrily
on
.
<EOS>
Our
music
consist
of
two
fiddle
,
with
a
pipe
and
tabor
.
<EOS>
the
moon
shine
bright
,
Mr
Thornhill
and
my
eld
daughter
lead
up
the
ball
,
to
the
great
delight
of
the
spectator
;
for
the
neighbour
hear
what
be
go
forward
,
come
flock
about
us
.
<EOS>
My
girl
move
with
so
much
grace
and
vivacity
,
that
my
wife
could
not
avoid
discover
the
pride
of
her
heart
,
by
assure
me
,
that
though
the
little
chit
do
it
so
cleverly
,
all
the
step
be
steal
from
herself
.
<EOS>
the
lady
of
the
town
strive
hard
to
be
equally
easy
,
but
without
success
.
<EOS>
They
swam
,
sprawl
,
languish
,
and
frisk
;
but
all
would
not
do
:
the
gazer
indeed
own
that
it
be
fine
;
but
neighbour
Flamborough
observe
,
that
Miss
Livy
's
foot
seem
as
pat
to
the
music
as
its
echo
.
<EOS>
after
the
dance
have
continue
about
an
hour
,
the
two
lady
,
who
be
apprehensive
of
catch
cold
,
move
to
break
up
the
ball
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
I
think
,
express
her
sentiment
upon
this
occasion
in
a
very
coarse
manner
,
when
she
observe
,
that
by
the
live
jingo
,
she
be
all
of
a
muck
of
sweat
.
<EOS>
upon
our
return
to
the
house
,
we
find
a
very
elegant
cold
supper
,
which
Mr
Thornhill
have
order
to
be
bring
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
at
this
time
be
more
reserved
than
before
.
<EOS>
the
two
lady
throw
my
girl
quite
into
the
shade
;
for
they
would
talk
of
nothing
but
high
life
,
and
high
live
company
;
with
other
fashionable
topic
,
such
as
picture
,
taste
,
Shakespear
,
and
the
musical
glass
.
'
<EOS>
tis
true
they
once
or
twice
mortify
us
sensibly
by
slip
out
an
oath
;
but
that
appear
to
me
as
the
sure
symptom
of
their
distinction
,
(
tho
"
I
be
since
inform
that
swearing
be
perfectly
unfashionable
.
)
<EOS>
Their
finery
,
however
,
throw
a
veil
over
any
grossness
in
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
seem
to
regard
their
superior
accomplishment
with
envy
;
and
what
appear
amiss
be
ascribe
to
tip
-
top
quality
breeding
.
<EOS>
but
the
condescension
of
the
lady
be
still
superior
to
their
other
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
observe
,
that
have
mis
Olivia
<EOS>
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
,
it
would
greatly
improve
her
.
<EOS>
to
which
the
other
add
,
that
a
single
winter
in
town
would
make
her
little
Sophia
quite
another
thing
.
<EOS>
My
wife
warmly
assent
to
both
;
add
,
that
there
be
nothing
she
more
ardently
wish
than
to
give
her
girl
a
single
winter
's
polishing
.
<EOS>
to
this
I
could
not
help
reply
,
that
their
breeding
be
already
superior
to
their
fortune
;
and
that
great
refinement
would
only
serve
to
make
their
poverty
ridiculous
,
and
give
them
a
taste
for
pleasure
they
have
no
right
to
possess
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
what
pleasure
,

cry
Mr

,
"
do
they
not
deserve
to
possess

have
so
much

curse
me
if
a
settlement
of
half
my
estate
could
give
my
charming
Olivia
pleasure
,
it
should
be
hers
;
and
the
only
favour
I
would
ask
in
return
would
be
to
add
myself
to
the
benefit

I
be
not

the
insolence

I
make
an
effort

suppress
my
resentment

the

seem
highly
displeased
with

stroke

and
I
,
soon
join
;
and
the
"
Squire
himself
be
at
last
bring
to
confess
a
sense
of
sorrow
for
his
former
excess
.
<EOS>
We
talk
of
the
pleasure
of
temperance
,
and
of
the
sun
-
shine
in
the
mind
unpollute
with
guilt
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
well
pleased
,
that
my
little
one
be
keep
up
beyond
the
usual
time
to
be
edify
by
so
much
good
conversation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Thornhill
even
go
beyond
me
,
and
demand
if
I
have
any
objection
to
give
prayer
.
<EOS>
I
joyfully
embrace
the
proposal
,
and
in
this
manner
the
night
be
pass
in
a
most
comfortable
way
,
till
at
last
the
company
begin
to
think
of
return
.
<EOS>
the
lady
seem
very
unwilling
to
part
with
my
daughter
;
for
whom
they
have
conceive
a
particular
affection
,
and
join
in
a
request
to
have
the
pleasure
of
their
company
home
.
<EOS>
the
"
Squire
second
the
proposal
,
and
my
wife
add
her
entreaty
:
the
girl
too
look
upon
me
as
if
they
wish
to
go
.
<EOS>
in
this
perplexity
I
make
two
or
three
excuse
,
which
my
daughter
as
readily
remove
;
so
that
at
last
I
be
oblige
to
give
a
peremptory
refusal
;
for
which
we
have
nothing
but
sullen
look
and
short
answer
<EOS>
the
whole
day
ensue
.
    
<EOS>
the
family
endeavour
to
cope
with
their
better
.
<EOS>
the
misery
of
the
poor
when
they
attempt
to
appear
above
their
circumstance
  
I
now
begin
to
find
that
all
my
long
and
painful
lecture
upon
temperance
,
simplicity
,
and
contentment
,
be
entirely
disregard
.
<EOS>
the
distinction
lately
pay
us
by
our
better
awake
that
pride
which
I
have
lay
asleep
,
but
not
remove
.
<EOS>
Our
window
again
,
as
formerly
,
be
fill
with
wash
for
the
neck
and
face
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
dread
as
an
enemy
to
the
skin
without
door
,
and
the
fire
as
a
spoiler
of
the
complexion
within
.
<EOS>
My
wife
observe
,
that
rise
too
early
.
<EOS>
would
hurt
her
daughter
'
eye
,
that
work
after
dinner
would
redden
their
nose
,
and
she
convince
me
that
the
hand
never
look
so
white
as
when
they
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
instead
therefore
of
finish
George
's
shirt
,
we
now
have
them
new
model
their
old
gauze
,
or
flourish
upon
catgut
.
<EOS>
the
poor
Miss
Flamboroughs
,
their
former
gay
companion
,
be
cast
off
as
mean
acquaintance
,
and
the
whole
conversation
run
upon
high
life
and
high
live
company
,
with
picture
,
taste
,
Shakespear
,
and
the
musical
glass
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
could
have
bear
all
this
,
have
not
a
fortune
-
tell
gypsey
come
to
raise
us
into
perfect
sublimity
.
<EOS>
the
tawny
sybil
no
sooner
appear
,
than
my
girl
come
run
to
me
for
a
shill
a
piece
to
cross
her
hand
with
silver
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
be
tired
of
be
always
wise
,
and
could
not
help
gratify
their
request
,
because
I
love
to
see
them
happy
.
<EOS>
I
give
each
of
them
a
shilling
;
though
,
for
the
honour
of
the
family
,
it
must
be
observe
,
that
they
never
go
without
money
themselves
,
as
my
wife
always
generously
let
them
have
a
guinea
each
,
to
keep
in
their
pocket
;
but
with
strict
injunction
never
to
change
it
.
<EOS>
after
they
have
be
closette
up
with
the
fortune
-
teller
for
some
time
,
I
know
by
their
look
,
upon
their
return
,
that
they
have
be
promise
something
great
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
girl
,
how
have
you
speed
?
<EOS>
tell
me
,
Livy
,
have
the
fortune
-
teller
give
thee
a
pennyworth
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
protest
,
pappa
,
"
say
the
girl
,
"
I
believe
she
deal
with
some
body
that
be
not
right
;
for
she
positively
declare
,
that
I
be
to
be
married
to
a
"
Squire
in
less
than
a
twelvemonth
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
now
,
Sophy
,
my
child
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
what
sort
of
a
husband
be
you
to
have
?
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
reply
she
,
"
I
be
to
have
a
Lord
soon
after
my
sister
have
marry
the
"
Squire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
"
cry
I
,
"
be
that
all
you
be
to
have
for
your
two
shilling
!
<EOS>
only
a
Lord
and
a
"
Squire
for
two
shilling
!
<EOS>
You
fool
,
I
could
have
promise
you
a
Prince
and
a
Nabob
for
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
curiosity
of
theirs
,
however
,
be
attend
with
very
serious
effect
:
we
now
begin
to
think
ourselves
design
by
the
star
for
something
exalt
,
and
already
anticipate
our
future
grandeur
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
thousand
time
observe
,
and
I
must
observe
it
once
more
,
that
the
hour
we
pass
with
happy
prospect
in
view
,
be
more
pleasing
than
those
crown
with
fruition
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
case
we
cook
the
dish
to
our
own
appetite
;
in
the
latter
nature
cook
it
for
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
repeat
the
train
of
agreeable
reverie
we
call
up
for
our
entertainment
.
<EOS>
We
look
upon
our
fortune
as
once
more
rise
;
and
as
the
whole
parish
assert
that
the
"
Squire
be
in
love
with
my
daughter
,
she
be
actually
so
with
him
;
for
they
persuade
her
into
the
passion
.
<EOS>
in
this
agreeable
interval
,
my
wife
have
the
most
lucky
dream
in
the
world
,
which
she
take
care
to
tell
us
every
morning
,
with
great
solemnity
and
exactness
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
night
a
coffin
and
cross
bone
,
the
sign
of
an
approach
wedding
:
at
another
time
she
imagine
her
daughter
"
pocket
fill
with
farthing
,
a
certain
sign
of
their
be
shortly
stuff
with
gold
.
<EOS>
the
girl
themselves
have
their
omen
.
<EOS>
They
feel
strange
kiss
on
their
lip
;
they
see
ring
in
the
candle
,
purse
bounce
from
the
fire
,
and
true
love
-
knot
lurk
in
the
bottom
of
every
tea
-
cup
.
  
<EOS>
towards
the
end
of
the
week
we
receive
a
card
from
the
town
lady
;
in
which
,
with
their
compliment
,
they
hope
to
see
all
our
family
at
church
the
Sunday
follow
.
<EOS>
all
Saturday
morning
I
could
perceive
,
in
consequence
of
this
,
my
wife
and
daughter
in
close
conference
together
,
and
now
and
then
glance
at
me
with
look
that
betray
a
latent
plot
.
<EOS>
to
be
sincere
,
I
have
strong
suspicion
that
some
absurd
proposal
be
prepare
for
appear
with
splendor
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
they
begin
their
operation
in
a
very
regular
manner
,
and
my
wife
undertake
to
conduct
the
siege
.
<EOS>
after
tea
,
when
I
seem
in
spirit
,
she
begin
thus
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
Charles
,
my
dear
,
we
shall
have
a
great
deal
of
good
company
at
our
church
to
-
morrow
,
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
we
may
,
my
dear
,
"
return
I
;
"
though
you
need
be
under
no
uneasiness
about
that
,
you
shall
have
a
sermon
whether
there
be
or
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
expect
,
"
return
she
;
"
but
I
think
,
my
dear
,
we
ought
to
appear
there
as
decently
as
possible
,
for
who
know
what
may
happen
?
"
<EOS>
"
Your
precaution
,
"
reply
I
,
"
be
highly
commendable
.
<EOS>
a
decent
behaviour
and
appearance
in
church
be
what
charm
me
.
<EOS>
We
should
be
devout
and
humble
,
chearful
and
serene
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
cry
she
,
"
I
know
that
;
but
<EOS>
I
mean
we
should
go
there
in
as
proper
a
manner
as
possible
;
not
altogether
like
the
scrub
about
us
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
,
my
dear
,
"
return
I
,
"
and
I
be
go
to
make
the
very
same
proposal
.
<EOS>
the
proper
manner
of
go
be
,
to
go
there
as
early
as
possible
,
to
have
time
for
meditation
before
the
service
begin
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Phoo
,
Charles
,
"
interrupt
she
,
"
all
that
be
very
true
;
but
not
what
I
would
be
at
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
we
should
go
there
genteelly
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
church
be
two
mile
off
,
and
I
protest
I
do
not
like
to
see
my
daughter
trudge
up
to
their
pew
all
blowze
and
red
with
walking
,
and
,
look
for
all
the
world
as
if
they
have
be
winner
at
a
smock
race
.
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
my
proposal
be
this
:
there
be
our
two
plow
horse
,
the
Colt
that
have
be
in
our
family
these
nine
year
,
and
his
companion
Blackberry
,
that
have
scarce
do
an
earthly
thing
for
this
month
past
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
grow
fat
and
lazy
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
they
do
something
as
well
as
we
?
<EOS>
and
let
me
tell
you
,
when
Moses
have
trim
them
a
little
,
they
will
cut
a
very
tolerable
figure
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
proposal
I
object
,
that
walk
would
be
twenty
time
more
genteel
than
such
a
paltry
conveyance
,
as
Blackberry
be
wall
-
eyed
,
and
the
Colt
want
a
tail
:
<EOS>
that
they
have
never
be
break
to
the
rein
;
but
have
an
hundred
vicious
trick
;
and
that
we
have
<EOS>
but
one
saddle
and
pillion
in
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
all
these
objection
,
however
,
be
over
-
rule
;
so
that
I
be
oblige
to
comply
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
perceive
them
not
a
little
busy
in
collect
such
material
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
expedition
;
but
as
I
find
it
would
be
a
business
of
time
,
I
walk
on
to
the
church
before
,
and
they
promise
speedily
to
follow
.
<EOS>
I
wait
near
an
hour
in
the
read
desk
for
their
arrival
;
but
not
find
them
come
as
expect
,
I
be
oblige
to
begin
,
and
go
through
the
service
,
not
without
some
uneasiness
at
find
them
absent
.
<EOS>
this
be
encrease
when
all
be
finish
,
and
no
appearance
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
walk
back
by
the
horse
-
way
,
which
be
five
mile
round
,
tho
"
<EOS>
the
foot
-
way
be
but
two
,
and
when
get
about
half
way
home
,
perceive
the
procession
march
slowly
forward
towards
the
church
;
my
son
,
my
wife
,
and
the
two
little
one
exalt
upon
one
horse
,
and
my
two
daughter
upon
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
demand
the
cause
of
their
delay
;
but
I
soon
find
by
their
look
they
have
meet
with
a
thousand
misfortune
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
horse
have
at
first
refuse
to
move
from
the
door
,
till
Mr
Burchell
be
kind
enough
to
beat
them
forward
for
about
two
hundred
yard
with
his
cudgel
.
<EOS>
next
the
strap
of
my
wife
's
pillion
break
down
,
and
they
be
oblige
to
stop
to
repair
them
before
they
could
proceed
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
one
of
the
horse
take
it
into
his
head
to
stand
still
,
and
neither
blow
nor
entreaty
could
prevail
with
him
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
recover
from
this
dismal
situation
that
I
find
them
;
but
perceive
every
thing
safe
<EOS>
,
I
own
their
present
mortification
<EOS>
do
not
much
displease
me
,
as
it
would
give
me
many
opportunity
of
future
triumph
,
and
teach
my
daughter
more
humility
.
      
<EOS>
the
family
still
resolve
to
hold
up
their
head
  
<EOS>
Michaelmas
eve
happen
on
the
next
day
,
we
be
invite
to
burn
nut
and
play
trick
at
neighbour
Flamborough
's
.
<EOS>
Our
late
mortification
have
humble
us
a
little
,
or
it
be
probable
<EOS>
we
may
have
reject
such
an
invitation
with
contempt
:
however
,
we
suffer
ourselves
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Our
honest
neighbour
's
goose
and
dumpling
be
fine
,
and
the
lamb's
-
wool
,
even
in
the
opinion
of
my
wife
,
who
be
a
connoiscur
,
be
excellent
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
his
manner
of
tell
story
be
not
quite
so
well
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
long
,
and
very
dull
,
and
all
about
himself
,
and
we
have
laugh
at
them
ten
time
before
:
however
,
we
be
kind
enough
to
laugh
at
them
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Burchell
,
who
be
of
the
party
,
be
always
fond
of
see
some
innocent
amusement
go
forward
,
and
set
the
boy
and
girl
to
blind
man
's
buff
.
<EOS>
My
wife
too
be
persuade
to
join
in
the
diversion
,
and
it
give
me
pleasure
to
think
she
be
not
yet
too
old
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
my
neighbour
and
I
look
on
,
laugh
at
every
feat
,
and
praise
our
own
dexterity
when
we
be
young
.
<EOS>
hot
cockle
succeed
next
,
question
and
command
follow
that
,
and
last
of
all
,
they
sate
down
to
hunt
the
slipper
.
<EOS>
as
every
person
may
not
be
acquaint
with
this
primaeval
pastime
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
observe
,
that
the
company
at
this
play
themselves
in
a
ring
upon
the
ground
,
all
,
except
one
who
stand
in
the
middle
,
whose
business
it
be
to
catch
a
shoe
,
which
the
company
shove
about
under
their
ham
from
one
to
another
,
something
like
a
weaver
's
shuttle
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
impossible
,
in
this
case
,
for
the
lady
who
be
up
to
face
all
the
company
at
once
,
the
great
beauty
of
the
play
lie
in
hit
her
a
thump
with
the
heel
of
the
shoe
on
that
side
least
capable
of
make
a
defence
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
manner
that
my
eld
daughter
be
hem
in
,
and
thump
about
,
all
blowze
,
in
spirit
,
and
bawl
for
fair
play
,
fair
play
,
with
a
voice
that
may
deafen
a
ballad
singer
,
when
confusion
on
confusion
,
who
should
enter
the
room
but
our
two

acquaintance
from

,
Lady
Blarney
and
Miss
Carolina
Wilelmina
Amelia
Skeggs

<EOS>
description
would
but
beggar

therefore
it
be
unnecessary
to
describe
this
new
mortification
.
<EOS>
death
!
<EOS>
to
be
see
by
lady
of
such
high
breeding
in
such
vulgar
attitude
!
<EOS>
nothing
well
could
ensue
from
such
a
vulgar
play
of
Mr
Flamborough
's
proposing
.
<EOS>
We
seem
stuck
to
the
ground
for
some
time
,
as
if
actually
petrify
with
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
lady
have
be
at
our
house
to
see
us
,
and
find
us
from
home
,

they

<EOS>
nothing
could
exceed
their
complaisance
to
my

their
profession
the

be
warm

but
now
they
be
ardent
.
<EOS>
They
protest
a
desire
of
have
a

lasting
acquaintance

<EOS>
Lady

Miss

(
I
love
to

a
great
fancy

They
support
the
conversation
between
themselves

while
my

silent

admire
their

breeding

<EOS>
but
as
every

be
fond
of
high

live
dialogue

with
anecdote
of
Lords

this
I
can
say

that

this

<EOS>

previously
I
should
have
mention
the
very
impolite
behaviour
of
Mr

who
,
during
this
discourse
,
sate
with
his
face
<EOS>
turn
to
the
fire
,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
every
sentence
would
cry
out
FUDGE

an
expression
which
displease
us
all

in
some
measure
damp
the

a

my

<EOS>
My
wife
have
be
for
a
long
time
all
attention
to
this
discourse
;
but
be
particularly
strike
with
the
latter
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
thirty
pound
and
twenty
-
five
guinea
a
year
make
fifty
-
six
pound
five
shilling
<EOS>
english
money
,
all
which

in
a
manner
go
a

begging

<EOS>
She
for
a
moment
study
my
look
for
approbation
;
and
,
to
own
a
truth
,
I
be
of
opinion
,
that
two
such
place
would
fit
our
two
daughter
exactly

besides

if
the

Squire
have
any
real
affection
for
my

daughter

this
would
be
the
way
to
make
her
every
way
qualified
for
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
My
wife
therefore
be
resolve
that
we
should
not
be
deprive
of
such
advantage
for
want
of
assurance
,
and
undertake
to
harangue
for
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
cry
she
,
"
your
Ladyships
will
pardon
my
present
presumption

<EOS>
It
be
true
,
we
have
no
right
to
pretend
to
such
favour
;
but
yet
it
be
natural
for
me
to
wish
put
my
child
forward
in
the
world

<EOS>
and
I
will
be
bold
to
say
my
two
girl
have
have
a
pretty
good
education
,
and
<EOS>
capacity
,
at
least
the
country
can
not
shew
better
.

They
can
read

;
they
understand
their

cross
and
change
,
and
all
manner
of
plain

work
;
they
can
pink

point

and
know
something
of
music

they
can
do
up
small
cloath

work

my

cut
paper

my

pretty

fortune

card

"
 
"
FUDGE

<EOS>
when
she
have
deliver
this
pretty
piece
of
eloquence
,
the
two
lady
look
at
each
other
a
few
minute
in
silence
,
with
an
air
of
doubt
and
importance
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
Miss
Carolina
Wilelmina
Amelia
Skeggs
condescend
to
observe
,
that
the
young
lady
,
from
the
opinion
she
could
form
of
them
from
so
slight
an
acquaintance
,
seem
very
fit
for
such
employment
:
"
<EOS>
but
a
thing
of
this
kind
,
Madam

cry
she
,

my

a
thorough
examination
into

not
,
Madam

"
continue
she
,
"
that
I
in

a
form
in
these
thing

Madam

there
be
a
form

"
  
<EOS>
My
wife
approve
her
suspicion
very
much
,
observe
,
that
she
be
very
apt
to
be
suspicious
herself
;
but
refer
her
to
all
the
neighbour
for
a
character
:
but
this
our
Peeress
decline
as
unnecessary
,
alledge
that
her
cousin
Thornhill
's
recommendation
would
be
sufficient
,
and
upon
this
we
rest
our
petition
.
     
<EOS>
Fortune
seem
resolve
to
humble
the
family
of
Wakefield
.
<EOS>
mortification
be
often
more
painful
than
real
calamity
  
when
we
be
return
home
,
the
night
be
dedicate
to
scheme
of
future
conquest
.
<EOS>
Deborah
exert
much
sagacity
in
conjecturing
which
of
the
two
girl
be
likely
to
have
the
good
place
,
and
most
opportunity
of
see
good
company
.
<EOS>
the
only
obstacle
to
our
preferment
be
in
obtain
the
"
Squire
's
recommendation
;
but
he
have
already
shew
us
too
many
instance
of
his
friendship
to
doubt
of
it
now
.
<EOS>
even
in
bed
my
wife
keep
up
the
usual
theme
:
"
<EOS>
well
,
faith
,
my
dear
Charles
,
between
ourselves
,
I
think
we
have
make
an
excellent
day
's
work
of
it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
pretty
well
,
"
cry
I
,
not
know
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
only
pretty
well
!
"
return
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
very
well
.
<EOS>
suppose
the
girl
should
come
to
make
acquaintance
of
taste
in
town
!
<EOS>
this
I
be
assure
of
,
that
London
be
the
only
place
in
the
world
for
all
manner
of
husband
.
<EOS>
besides
,
my
dear
,
strange
thing
happen
every
day
:
and
as
lady
of
quality
be
so
take
with
my
daughter
,
what
will
not
man
of
quality
be
!
<EOS>
Entre
nous
,
I
protest
I
like
my
Lady
Blarney
vastly
,
so
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
however
,
Miss
Carolina
Wilelmina
Anielia
Skeggs
have
my
warm
heart
.
<EOS>
but
yet
,
when
they
come
to
talk
of
place
in
town
,
you
see
at
once
how
I
nail
them
.
<EOS>
tell
me
,
my
dear
,
do
not
you
think
I
do
for
my
child
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
return
I
,
not
know
well
what
to
think
of
the
matter
,
"
heaven
grant
they
may
be
both
the
well
for
it
this
day
three
month
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
those
observation
I
usually
make
to
impress
my
wife
with
an
opinion
of
my
sagacity
;
for
if
the
girl
succeed
,
then
it
be
a
pious
wish
fulfil
;
but
if
any
thing
unfortunate
ensue
,
then
it
may
be
look
upon
as
a
prophecy
.
<EOS>
all
this
conversation
,
however
,
be
only
preparatory
to
another
scheme
,
and
indeed
I
dread
as
much
.
<EOS>
this
be
nothing
less
than
,
that
as
we
be
now
to
hold
up
our
head
a
little
high
in
the
world
,
it
would
be
proper
to
sell
the
Colt
,
which
be
grow
old
,
at
a
neighbour
fair
,
and
buy
us
an
horse
that
would
carry
single
or
double
upon
an
occasion
,
and
make
a
pretty
appearance
at
church
or
upon
a
visit
.
<EOS>
this
at
first
I
oppose
stoutly
;
but
it
be
as
stoutly
defended
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
weaken
,
my
antagonist
gain
strength
,
till
at
last
it
be
resolve
to
part
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
fair
happen
on
the
follow
day
,
I
have
intention
of
go
myself
,
but
my
wife
persuade
me
that
I
have
get
a
cold
,
and
nothing
could
prevail
upon
her
to
permit
me
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
our
son
Moses
be
a
discreet
boy
,
and
can
buy
and
sell
to
very
good
advantage
;
you
know
all
our
great
bargain
be
of
his
purchasing
.
<EOS>
He
always
stand
out
and
higgle
,
and
actually
tire
them
till
he
get
a
bargain
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
some
opinion
of
my
son
's
prudence
,
I
be
willing
enough
to
entrust
him
with
this
commission
;
and
the
next
morning
I
perceive
his
sister
mighty
busy
in
fit
out
Moses
for
the
fair
;
trim
his
hair
,
brush
his
buckle
,
and
cock
his
hat
with
pin
.
<EOS>
the
business
of
the
toilet
be
over
,
we
have
at
last
the
satisfaction
of
see
him
mount
upon
the
Colt
,
with
a
deal
box
before
him
to
bring
home
grocery
in
.
<EOS>
He
have
on
a
coat
make
of
that
cloth
they
call
thunder
and
lightning
,
which
,
though
grow
too
short
,
be
much
too
good
to
be
throw
away
.
<EOS>
His
waistcoat
be
of
gosle
green
,
and
his
sister
have
tie
his
hair
with
a
broad
black
ribband
.
<EOS>
We
all
follow
him
several
pace
,
from
the
door
,
bawl
after
him
good
luck
,
good
luck
,
till
we
could
see
him
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
scarce
go
,
when
Mr
Thornhill
's
butler
come
to
congratulate
us
upon
our
good
fortune
,
say
,
that
he
overhear
his
young
master
<EOS>

our
name
with
great
commendation
.
  
<EOS>
good
fortune
seem
resolve
not
to
come
alone
.
<EOS>
another
footman
from
the
same
family
follow
,
with
a
card
for
my
daughter
,
import
,
that
the
two
lady
have
receive
such
pleasing
account
from
Mr
Thornhill
of
us
all
,
that
,
after
a
few
previous
enquiry
,
they
hope
to
be
perfectly
satisfied
.
"
<EOS>
ay

"
cry
my
wife
,
I
now
see
it
be
no
easy
matter
to
get
into
the
family
of
the
great
;
but
when
one
once
get
in
,
then
,
as
Moses
say
,
one
may
go
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
piece
of
humour
,
for
she
intend
it
for
wit
,
my
daughter
assent
with
a
loud
laugh
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
such
be
her
satisfaction
at
this
message
,
that
she
actually
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
,
and
give
the
messenger
seven
-
pence
halfpenny
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
to
be
our
visit
-
day
.
<EOS>
the
next
that
come
be
Mr
Burchell
,
who
have
be
at
the
fair
.
<EOS>
He
bring
my
little
one
a
pennyworth
of
gingerbread
each
,
which
my
wife
undertake
to
keep
for
them
,
and
give
them
by
letter
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
He
bring
my
daughter
also
a
couple
of
box
,
in
which
they
may
keep
wafer
,
snuff
,
patch
,
or
even
money
,
when
they
get
it
.
<EOS>
My
wife
be
usually
fond
of
a
weesel
skin
purse
,
as
be
the
most
lucky
;
but
this
by
the
bye
.
<EOS>
We
have
still
a
regard
for
Mr
Burchell
,
though
his
late
rude
behaviour

in
some
measure

nor
could
we
now
avoid
communicate
our
happiness
to
him
,
and
ask
his
advice
:
although
we
seldom
follow
advice
,
we
be
all
ready
enough
to
ask
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
read
the
note
from
the
two
lady
,
he
shake
his
head
,
and
observe
,
that
an
affair
of
this
sort
demand
the
utmost
circumspection
.
 
<EOS>
this
air
of
diffidence
highly
displease
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
doubt
,
Sir
,
"
cry
she
,
"
your
readiness
to
be
against
my
daughter
and
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
more
circumspection
than
be
want
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
fancy
when
we
come
to
ask
advice
,
we
will
apply
to
person
who
seem
to
have
make
use
of
it
themselves
.

<EOS>
"
whatever
my
own
conduct
may
have
be

reply
he

"
be
not
the
present
question
;
<EOS>
tho
"
as
I
have
make
no
use
of

myself

I
should
in
conscience
give
it
to
those
that
will

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
I
be
apprehensive
this
answer
may
draw
on
a
repartee

make
up
by
abuse
what
it
want
in
wit
<EOS>
,
I
change
the
subject
,
by
seem
to
wonder
what
could
keep
our
son
so
long
at
the
fair
,
as
it
be
now
almost
nightfall

<EOS>
"
never

my

warrant
we

by

up

<EOS>
Mr
Burchell
be
find
to
be
an
enemy
;
for
he
have
the
confidence
to
give
disagreeable
advice
  
Our
family
have
now
make
several
attempt
to
be
fine
;
but
some
unforeseen
disaster
demolish
each
as
soon
as
project
.
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
take
the
advantage
of
every
disappointment
,
to
improve
their
good
sense
in
proportion
as
they
be
frustrate
in
ambition
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
child

cry
I
,
"
how
little
be
to
be
get
by
attempt
to
impose
upon
the
world
,
in
cope
with
our
better
.
<EOS>
such
as
be
poor
and
will
associate
with
none
but
the
rich

be
hate
by
those
they
avoid

despise
by
these
they
follow

<EOS>
unequal
combination
be
always
disadvantageous
to
the
weak
side
:
the
rich
have
the
pleasure
,
and
the
poor
the
inconveniencie
that
result
from
them
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
Dick
,
my
boy
,
and
repeat
the
fable
that
you
be
read
to
-
day
,
for
the
good
of
the
company
.
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
once
upon
a
time
,
"
cry
the
child
,
"
a
Giant
and
a
Dwarf
be
friend
,
and
keep
together
.
<EOS>
They
make
a
bargain
that
they
would
never
forsake
each
other
,
but
go
seek
adventure
.
<EOS>
the
first
battle
they
fight
be
with
two
saracen
,
and
the
Dwarf
,
who
be
very
courageous
,
deal
one
of
the
champion
a
most
angry
blow
.
<EOS>
It
do
the
Saracen
but
<EOS>
very
little
injury
,
who
lift
up
his
sword
,
fairly
strike
off
the
poor
Dwarf
's
arm
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
in
a
woeful
plight
;
but
the
Giant
come
to
his
assistance
,
in
a
short
time
leave
the
two
saracen
dead
on
the
plain
,
and
the
Dwarf
cut
off
the
dead
man
's
head
out
of
spite
.
<EOS>
They
then
travel
on
to
another
adventure
.
<EOS>
this
be
against
three
bloody
-
minded
Satyrs
,
who
be
carry
away
a
damsel
in
distress
.
<EOS>
the
Dwarf
be
not
quite
so
fierce
now
as
before
;
but
for
all
that
,
strike
the
first
blow
,
which
be
return
by
another
,
that
knock
out
his
eye
:
but
the
Giant
be
soon
up
with
them
,
and
have
they
not
flee
,
would
certainly
have
kill
them
every
one
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
very
joyful
for
this
victory
,
and
the
damsel
who
be
relieve
fall
in
love
with
the
Giant
,
and
marry
him
.
<EOS>
They
now
travel
far
,
and
farther
than
I
can
tell
,
till
they
meet
with
a
company
of
robber
.
<EOS>
the
Giant
,
for
the
first
time
,
be
foremost
now
;
but
the
Dwarf
be
not
far
behind
.
<EOS>
the
battle
be
stout
and
long
.
<EOS>
wherever
the
Giant
come
all
fall
before
him
;
but
the
Dwarf
have
like
to
have
be
kill
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
victory
declare
for
the
two
adventurer
;
but
the
Dwarf
lose
his
leg
.
<EOS>
the
Dwarf
be
now
without
an
arm
,
a
leg
,
and
an
eye
,
while
the
Giant
be
without
a
single
wound
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
cry
out
to
his
little
companion
,
My
little
heroe
,
this
be
glorious
sport
;
let
us
get
one
victory
more
,
and
then
we
shall
have
honour
for
ever
.
<EOS>
no
,
cry
<EOS>
the
Dwarf
who
be
by
this
time
grow
wise
,
no
,
I
declare
off
;
I
will
fight
no
more
;
for
I
find
in
every
battle
that
you
get
all
the
honour
and
reward
,
but
all
the
blow
fall
upon
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
moralize
this
fable
,
when
our
attention
be
call
off
to
a
warm
dispute
between
my
wife
and
Mr
Burchell
,
upon
my
daughter
intend
expedition
to
town
.
<EOS>
My
wife
very
strenuously
insist
upon
the
advantage
that
would
result
from
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Burchell
,
on
the
contrary
,
dissuade
her
with
great
ardor
,
and
I
stand
neuter
.
<EOS>
His
present
dissuasion
seem
but
the
second
part
of
those
which
be
receive
with
so
ill
a
grace
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
dispute
grow
high
while
poor
Deborah
,
instead
of
reason
strong
,
talk
louder
,
and
at
last
be
oblige
to
take
shelter
from
a
defeat
in
clamour
.
<EOS>
the
conclusion
of
her
harangue
,
however
,
be
highly
displeasing
to
us
all
:
she
know
,
she
say
,
of
some
who
have
their
own
secret
reason
for
what
they
advise
;
but
,
for
her
part
,
she
wish
such
to
stay
away
from
her
house
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
cry
Burchell
,
with
look
of
great
composure
,
which
tend
to
enflame
her
the
more
,
"
as
for
secret
reason
,
you
be
right
:
<EOS>
I
have
secret
reason
,
which
I
forbear
to
mention
,
because
you
be
not
able
to
answer
those
of
which
I
make
no
secret
:
but
I
find
my
visit
here
be
become
troublesome
;
I
will
take
my
leave
therefore
now
,
and
perhaps
come
once
more
to
take
a
final
farewell
when
I
be
quit
the
country
.
"
<EOS>
thus
say
,
he
take
up
his
hat
,
nor
could
the
attempt
of
Sophia
,
whose
look
seem
to
upbraid
his
precipitancy
,
prevent
his
going
.
  
<EOS>
when
go
,
we
all
regard
each
other
for
some
minute
with
confusion
.
<EOS>
My
wife
,
who
know
herself
to
be
the
cause
,
strove
to
hide
her
concern
with
a
force
smile
,
and
an
air
of
assurance
,
which
I
be
willing
to
reprove
:
"
how
,
woman
,
"
cry
I
to
her
,
"
be
it
<EOS>
thus
we
treat
stranger
?
<EOS>
be
it
<EOS>
thus
we
return
their
kindness
?
<EOS>
be
assure
,
my
dear
,
that
these
be
the
harsh
word
,
and
to
me
the
most
unpleasing
that
ever
escape
your
lip
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
would
he
provoke
me
then
,
"
reply
she
;
"
but
I
know
the
motive
of
his
advice
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
He
would
prevent
my
girl
from
go
to
town
,
that
he
may
have
the
pleasure
of
my
young
daughter
's
company
here
at
home
.
<EOS>
but
whatever
happen
,
she
shall
chuse
well
company
than
such
low
-
live
fellow
as
he
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
low
-
live
,
my
dear
,
do
you
call
him
,
"
cry
I
,
"
it
be
very
possible
we
may
mistake
this
man
's
character
:
<EOS>
for
he
seem
upon
some
occasion
the
most
finished
gentleman
I
ever
know
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
,
Sophia
,
my
girl
,
have
he
ever
give
you
any
secret
instance
of
his
attachment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
conversation
with
me
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
reply
my
daughter
,
"
have
ever
be
sensible
,
modest
,
and
pleasing

<EOS>
as
to
aught
else

no
,
never

<EOS>
once
,
indeed
,
I
remember
to
have
hear
him
say
he
never
know
a
woman
who
could
find
merit
in
a
man
that
seem
poor

"
<EOS>
"
such
,
my
dear
,
"
cry
I
,
"
be
the
common
can
not
of
all
the
unfortunate
or
idle
.
<EOS>
but
I
hope
you
have
be
teach
to
judge
properly
of
such
man
,
and
that
it
would
be
even
madness
to
expect
happiness
from
one
who
have
be
so
very
bad
an
oeconomist
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
and
I
have
now
well
prospect
for
you
.
<EOS>
the
next
winter
,
which
you
will
probably
spend
in
town
,
will
give
you
opportunity
of
make
a
more
prudent
choice
.
<EOS>
"
what
Sophia
's
reflection
be
upon
this
occasion
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
determine
;
but
I
be
not
displease
at
the
bottom
that
we
be
rid
of
a
guest
from
whom
I
have
much
to
fear
.
<EOS>
Our
breach
of
hospitality
go
to
my
conscience
a
little
:
<EOS>
but
I
quickly
silence
that
monitor
by
two
or
three
specious
reason
,
which
serve
to
satisfy
and
reconcile
me
to
myself
.
<EOS>
the
pain
which
conscience
give
the
man
who
have
already
do
wrong
,
be
soon
get
over
.
<EOS>
Conscience
be
a
coward
,
and
those
fault
it
have
not
strength
enough
to
prevent
,
it
seldom
have
justice
enough
to
accuse
.
     
<EOS>
fresh
mortification
,
or
a
demonstration
that
seem
calamity
may
be
real
blessing
  
<EOS>
the
journey
of
my
daughter
to
town
be
now
resolve
upon
,
Mr
Thornhill
have
kindly
promise
to
inspect
their
conduct
himself
,
and
inform
us
by
letter
of
their
behaviour
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
think
indispensably
necessary
that
their
appearance
should
equal
the
greatness
of
their
expectation
,
which
could
not
be
do
without
expence
.
<EOS>
We
debate
therefore
in
full
council
what
be
the
easy
method
of
raise
money
,
or
,
more
properly
speak
,
what
we
could
most
conveniently
sell
.
<EOS>
the
deliberation
be
soon
finish
,
it
be
find
that
our
remain
horse
be
utterly
useless
for
the
plow
,
without
his
companion
,
and
equally
unfit
for
the
road
,
as
want
an
eye
,
it
be
therefore
determined
that
we
should
dispose
of
him
for
the
purpose
above
-
mention
,
at
the
neighbouring
fair
,
and
,
to
prevent
imposition
,
that
I
should
go
with
him
myself
.
<EOS>
though
this
be
one
of
the
first
mercantile
transaction
of
my
life
,
yet
I
have
no
doubt
about
acquit
myself
with
reputation
.
<EOS>
the
opinion
a
man
form
of
his
own
prudence
be
measure
by
that
of
the
company
he
keep
,
and
as
mine
be
mostly
in
the
family
way
,
I
have
conceive
no
unfavourable
sentiment
of
my
worldly
wisdom
.
<EOS>
My
wife
,
however
,
next
morning
,
at
parting
,
after
I
have
get
some
pace
from
the
door
,
call
me
back
,
to
advise
me
,
in
a
whisper
,
to
have
all
my
eye
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
in
the
usual
form
,
when
I
come
to
the
fair
,
put
my
horse
through
all
his
pace
;
but
for
some
time
have
no
bidder
.
<EOS>
at
last
a
chapman
approach
,
and
,
<EOS>
after
he
have
for
a
good
while
examine
the
horse
round
,
find
him
blind
of
one
eye
,
he
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
:
a
second
come
up
;
but
observe
he
have
a
spavin
,
declare
he
would
not
take
him
for
the
drive
home
:
<EOS>
a
third
perceive
he
have
a
windgall
,
and
would
bid
no
money
:
a
fourth
knew
by
his
eye
that
he
have
the
botts
:
a
fifth
,
wonder
what
a
plague
I
could
do
at
the
fair
with
a
blind
,
spavine
,
galled
hack
,
that
be
only
fit
to
be
cut
up
for
a
dog
kennel
.
<EOS>
"
by
this
time
I
begin
to
have
a
most
hearty
contempt
for
the
poor
animal
myself
,
and
be
almost
ashamed
at
the
approach
of
every
customer
;
for
though
I
do
not
entirely
believe
all
the
fellow
tell
me
;
yet
I
reflect
that
the
number
of
witness
be
a
strong
presumption
they
be
right
,
and
St
Gregory
,
upon
good
work
,
profess
himself
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
this
mortifying
situation
,
when
a
brother
clergyman
,
an
old
acquaintance
,
who
have
also
business
to
the
fair
,
come
up
,
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
,
<EOS>
propose
adjourn
to
a
public
-
house
and
take
a
glass
of
whatever
we
could
get
.
<EOS>
I
readily
close
with
the
offer
,
and
enter
an
ale
-
house
,
we
be
shew
into
a
little
back
room
,
where
there
be
only
a
venerable
old
man
,
who
sit
wholly
intent
over
a
large
book
,
which
he
be
read
.
<EOS>
I
never
in
my
life
see
a
figure
that
prepossess
me
more
favourably
.
<EOS>
His
lock
of
silver
grey
venerably
shade
his
temple
,
and
his
green
old
age
seem
to
be
the
result
of
health
and
benevolence
.
<EOS>
however
,
his
presence
do
not
interrupt
our
conversation
;
my
friend
and
I
discourse
on
the
various
turn
of
fortune
we
have
meet
:
the
whistonean
controversy
,
my
last
pamphlet
,
the
archdeacon
's
reply
,
and
the
hard
measure
that
be
deal
me
.
<EOS>
but
our
attention
be
in
a
short
time
take
off
by
the
appearance
of
a
youth
,
who
,
enter
the
room
,
respectfully
say
something
softly
to
the
old
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
make
no
apology
,
my
child
,
"
say
the
old
man
,
"
to
do
good
be
a
duty
we
owe
to
all
our
fellow
creature
:
<EOS>
take
this
,
I
wish
it
be
more
;
but
five
pound
will
relieve
your
distress
,
and
you
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
the
modest
youth
shed
tear
of
gratitude
,
and
yet
his
gratitude
be
scarce
equal
to
mine
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
hug
the
good
old
man
in
my
arm
,
his
benevolence
please
me
so
.
<EOS>
He
continue
to
read
,
and
we
resume
our
conversation
,
until
my
companion
,
after
some
time
,
recollect
that
he
have
business
to
transact
in
the
fair
,
promise
to
be
soon
back
;
add
,
that
he
always
desire
to
have
as
much
of
Dr
Primrose
's
company
as
possible
.
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
,
hear
my
name
mention
,
seem
to
look
at
me
with
attention
,
for
some
time
,
and
when
my
friend
be
go
,
most
respectfully
demand
if
I
be
any
way
relate
to
the
great
Primrose
,
that
courageous
monogamist
,
who
have
be
the
bulwark
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
never
do
my
heart
feel
sincere
rapture
than
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
cry
I
,
"
the
applause
of
so
good
a
man
,
as
I
be
sure
you
be
,
add
to
that
happiness
in
my
breast
which
your
benevolence
have
already
excite
.
<EOS>
You
behold
before
you
,
Sir
,
that
Doctor
Primrose
,
the
monogamist
,
whom
you
have
be
pleased
to
call
great
.
<EOS>
You
here
see
that
unfortunate
Divine
,
who
have
so
long
,
and
<EOS>
it
would
ill
become
me
to
say
,
successfully
,
fight
against
the
deuterogamy
of
the
age
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
cry
the
stranger
,
strike
with
awe
,
"
<EOS>
I
fear
I
have
be
too
familiar
;
but
you
will
forgive
my
curiosity
,
Sir
:
I
beg
pardon
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
cry
I
,
grasp
his
hand
,
"
you
be
so
far
from
displease
me
by
your
familiarity
,
that
I
must
beg
you
will
accept
my
friendship
,
as
you
already
have
my
esteem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
with
gratitude
I
accept
the
offer
,
"
cry
he
,
squeeze
me
by
the
hand
,
"
thou
glorious
pillar
of
unshaken
orthodoxy
;
and
do
I
behold
 
<EOS>
"
I
here
interrupt
what
he
be
go
to
say
;
for
tho
'
,
as
an
author
,
I
could
digest
no
small
share
of
flattery
,
yet
now
my
modesty
would
permit
no
more
.
<EOS>
however
,
no
lover
in
romance
ever
cement
a
more
instantaneous
friendship
.
<EOS>
We
talk
upon
several
subject
:
at
first
I
think
he
seem
rather
devout
than
learn
,
and
begin
to
think
he
despise
all
human
doctrine
as
dross
.
<EOS>
yet
this
no
way
lessen
him
in
my
esteem
;
for
I
have
for
some
time
begin
privately
to
harbour
such
an
opinion
myself
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
take
occasion
to
observe
,
that
the
world
in
general
begin
to
be
blameably
indifferent
as
to
doctrinal
matter
,
and
follow
human
speculation
too
much
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
Sir
,
"
reply
he
,
as
if
he
have
reserve
all
his
learning
to
that
moment
,
"
ay
,
Sir
,
the
world
be
in
its
dotage
,
and
yet
the
cosmogony
or
creation
of
the
world
have
puzzle
philosopher
of
all
age
.
<EOS>
what
a
medly
of
opinion
have
they
not
broach
upon
the
creation
of
the
world
?
<EOS>
Sanconiathon
,
Manetho
,
Berosus
,
and
Ocellus
Lucanus
,
have
all
attempt
it
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
latter
have
these
word
,
Anarchon
ara
kai
atelutaion
to
pan
,
which
imply
that
all
thing
have
neither
begin
nor
end
.
<EOS>
Manetho
also
,
who
live
about
the
time
of
Nebuchadon
-
Asser
,
Asser
be
a
Syriac
word
usually
apply
as
a
sirname
to
the
king
of
that
country
,
as
Teglat
Phael
-
Asser
,
Nabon
-
Asser
,
he
,
I
say
,
form
a
conjecture
equally
absurd
;
for
as
we
usually
say
ek
to
biblion
kubernetes
,
which
imply
that
book
will
never
teach
the
world
;
so
he
attempt
to
investigate
 
<EOS>
but
,
Sir
,
I
ask
pardon
,
I
be
stray
from
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
that
he
actually
be
;
nor
could
I
for
my
life
see
how
the
creation
of
the
world
have
any
thing
to
do
with
the
business
I
be
talk
of
;
but
it
be
sufficient
to
shew
me
that
he
be
a
man
of
letter
,
and
I
now
reverence
him
the
more
.
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
therefore
to
bring
him
to
the
touch
-
stone
;
but
he
be
too
mild
and
too
gentle
to
contend
for
victory
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
make
any
observation
that
look
like
a
challenge
to
controversy
,
he
would
smile
,
shake
his
head
,
and
say
nothing
;
by
which
I
understand
he
could
say
much
,
if
he
think
proper
.
<EOS>
the
subject
therefore
insensibly
change
from
the
business
of
antiquity
to
that
which
bring
us
both
to
the
fair
;
mine
I
tell
him
be
to
sell
an
horse
,
and
very
luckily
,
indeed
,
<EOS>
his
be
to
buy
one
for
one
of
his
tenant
.
<EOS>
My
horse
be
soon
produce
,
and
in
fine
we
strike
a
bargain
.
<EOS>
nothing
now
remain
but
to
pay
me
,
and
he
accordingly
pull
out
a
thirty
pound
note
,
and
bid
me
change
it
.
<EOS>
not
be
in
a
capacity
of
comply
with
his
demand
,
he
order
his
footman
to
be
call
up
,
who
make
his
appearance
in
a
very
genteel
livery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
,
Abraham
,
"
cry
he
,
"
go
and
get
gold
for
this
;
you
will
do
it
at
neighbour
Jackson
's
,
or
any
where
.
<EOS>
"
while
the
fellow
be
go
,
he
entertain
me
with
a
pathetic
harangue
on
the
great
scarcity
of
silver
,
which
I
undertake
to
improve
,
by
deplore
also
the
great
scarcity
of
gold
;
so
that
by
the
time
Abraham
return
,
we
have
both
agree
that
money
be
never
so
hard
to
be
come
at
as
now
.
<EOS>
Abraham
return
to
inform
us
,
that
he
have
be
over
the
whole
fair
and
could
not
get
change
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
have
offer
half
a
crown
for
do
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
great
disappointment
to
us
all
;
but
the
old
gentleman
have
pause
a
little
,
ask
me
if
I
know
one
Solomon
Flamborough
in
my
part
of
the
country
:
upon
reply
that
he
be
my
next
door
neighbour
,
"
<EOS>
if
that
be
the
case
then
,
"
return
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
believe
we
shall
deal
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
a
draught
upon
him
,
payable
at
sight
;
and
let
me
tell
you
he
be
as
warm
a
man
as
any
within
five
mile
round
him
.
<EOS>
honest
Solomon
and
I
have
be
acquaint
for
many
year
together
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
always
beat
him
at
threejump
;
but
he
could
hop
upon
one
leg
farth
than
I.
"
<EOS>
a
draught
upon
my
neighbour
be
to
me
the
same
as
money
;
for
I
be
sufficiently
convinced
of
his
ability
:
the
draught
be
sign
and
put
into
my
hand
,
and
Mr
Jenkinson
,
the
old
gentleman
,
his
man
Abraham
,
and
my
horse
,
old
Blackberry
,
trot
off
very
well
pleased
with
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
interval
be
leave
to
reflection
,
I
begin
to
recollect
that
I
have
do
wrong
in
take
a
draught
from
a
stranger
,
and
so
prudently
resolve
upon
follow
the
purchaser
,
and
have
back
my
horse
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
now
too
late
:
I
therefore
make
directly
homeward
,
resolve
to
get
the
draught
change
into
money
at
my
friend
be
as
fast
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
find
my
honest
neighbour
smoke
his
pipe
at
his
own
door
,
and
inform
him
that
I
have
a
small
bill
upon
him
<EOS>
,
he
read
it
twice
over
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
read
the
name
,
I
suppose
,
"
cry
I
,
"
Ephraim
Jenkinson
.
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
return
he
,
"
the
name
be
write
plain
enough
,
and
I
know
the
gentleman
too
,
the
great
rascal
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
very
same
rogue
who
sell
us
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
be
he
not
a
venerable
looking
man
,
with
grey
hair
,
and
no
flap
to
his
pocket
-
hole
?
<EOS>
and
do
he
not
talk
a
long
string
of
learn
about
Greek
and
cosmogony
,
and
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
this
I
reply
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"
aye
,
"
continue
he
,
"
he
have
but
that
one
piece
of
learn
in
the
world
,
and
he
always
talk
it
away
whenever
he
find
a
scholar
in
company
;
but
I
know
the
rogue
,
and
will
catch
him
yet
.
<EOS>
"
though
I
be
already
sufficiently
mortify
,
my
great
struggle
be
to
come
,
in
face
my
wife
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
no
truant
be
ever
more
afraid
of
return
to
school
,
there
to
behold
the
master
's
visage
,
than
I
be
of
go
home
.
<EOS>
I
be
determined
,
however
,
to
anticipate
their
fury
,
by
first
fall
into
a
passion
myself
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
upon
enter
,
I
find
the
family
no
way
disposed
for
battle
.
<EOS>
My
wife
and
girl
be
all
in
tear
,
Mr
Thornhill
have
be
there
that
day
to
inform
them
,
that
their
journey
to
town
be
entirely
over
.
<EOS>
the
two
lady
have
hear
report
of
us
from
some
malicious
person
about
us
,
be
that
day
set
out
for
London
.
<EOS>
He
could
neither
discover
the
tendency
,
nor
the
author
of
these
,
but
whatever
they
may
be
,
or
whoever
may
have
broach
them
,
he
continue
to
assure
our
family
of
his
friendship
and
protection
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
therefore
,
that
they
bear
my
disappointment
with
great
resignation
,
as
it
be
eclipse
in
the
greatness
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
but
what
perplex
us
most
be
to
think
who
could
be
so
base
as
to
asperse
the
character
of
a
family
so
harmless
as
ours
,
too
humble
to
excite
envy
,
and
too
inoffensive
to
create
disgust
.
     
<EOS>
all
,
Mr
Burchell
's
villainy
at
once
detect
.
<EOS>
the
folly
of
be
over
-
wise
  
<EOS>
that
evening
and
a
part
of
the
follow
day
be
employ
in
fruitless
attempt
to
discover
our
enemy
:
scarce
a
family
in
the
neighbourhood
but
incur
our
suspicion
,
and
each
of
us
have
reason
for
our
opinion
best
know
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
as
we
be
in
this
perplexity
,
one
of
our
little
boy
,
who
have
be
play
abroad
,
bring
in
a
letter
-
case
,
which
he
find
on
the
green
.
<EOS>
It
be
quickly
know
to
belong
to
Mr
Burchell
,
with
whom
it
have
be
see
,
and
,
upon
examination
,
contain
some
hint
upon
different
subject
;
but
what
particularly
engage
our
attention
be
a
seal
note
,
superscribe
,
"
<EOS>
the
copy
of
a
letter
to
be
send
to
the
two
lady
at
Thornhill
-
castle
.
<EOS>
"
It
instantly
occur
that
he
be
the
base
informer
,
and
we
deliberate
whether
the
note
should
not
be
break
open
.
<EOS>
I
be
against
it
;
but
Sophia
,
who
say
she
be
sure
that
of
all
man
he
would
be
the
last
to
be
guilty
of
so
much
baseness
,
insist
upon
its
being
read
,
<EOS>
in
this
she
be
second
by
the
rest
of
the
family
,
and
,
at
their
joint
solicitation
,
I
read
as
follow
:
    
"
Ladies
,
 
the
bearer
will
sufficiently
satisfy
you
as
to
the
person
from
whom
this
come
:
one
at
least
the
friend
of
innocence
,
and
ready
to
prevent
its
be
seduce
.
<EOS>
I
be
inform
for
a
truth
,
that
you
have
some
intention
of
bring
two
young
lady
to
town
,
whom
I
have
some
knowledge
of
,
under
the
character
of
companion
.
<EOS>
as
I
would
neither
have
simplicity
impose
upon
,
nor
virtue
contaminate
,
I
must
offer
it
as
my
opinion
,
that
the
impropriety
of
such
a
step
will
be
attend
with
dangerous
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
have
never
be
my
way
to
treat
the
infamous
or
the
lewd
with
severity
;
nor
should
I
now
have
take
this
method
of
explain
myself
,
or
reprove
folly
,
do
it
not
aim
at
guilt
.
<EOS>
take
therefore
the
admonition
of
a
friend
,
and
seriously
reflect
on
the
consequence
of
introduce
infamy
and
vice
into
retreat
where
peace
and
innocence
have
hitherto
reside
.
<EOS>
"
Our
doubt
be
now
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
there
seem
indeed
something
applicable
to
both
side
in
this
letter
,
and
its
censure
may
as
well
be
refer
to
those
to
whom
it
be
write
,
as
to
us
;
but
the
malicious
meaning
be
obvious
,
and
we
go
no
farther
.
<EOS>
My
wife
have
scarce
patience
to
hear
me
to
the
end
,
but
rail
at
the
writer
with
unrestrained
resentment
.
<EOS>
Olivia
be
equally
severe
,
and
Sophia
seem
perfectly
amazed
at
his
baseness
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
part
,
it
appear
to
me
one
of
the
vile
instance
of
unprovoked
ingratitude
I
have
meet
with
.
<EOS>
nor
could
I
account
for
it
in
any
other
manner
than
by
impute
it
to
his
desire
of
detain
my
young
daughter
in
the
country
,
to
have
the
more
frequent
opportunity
of
an
interview
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
we
all
sate
ruminate
upon
scheme
of
vengeance
,
when
our
other
little
boy
come
run
in
to
tell
us
that
Mr
Burchell
be
approach
at
the
other
end
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
conceive
than
describe
the
complicated
sensation
which
be
feel
from
the
pain
of
a
recent
injury
,
and
the
pleasure
of
approach
vengeance
.
<EOS>
tho
"
our
intention
be
only
to
upbraid
him
with
his
ingratitude
;
yet
it
be
resolve
to
do
it
in
a
manner
that
would
be
perfectly
cut
.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
we
agree
to
meet
him
with
our
usual
smile
,
to
chat
in
the
beginning
with
more
than
ordinary
kindness
,
to
amuse
him
a
little
;
and
then
in
the
midst
of
the
flattering
calm
to
burst
upon
him
like
an
earthquake
,
and
overwhelm
him
with
the
sense
of
his
own
baseness
.
<EOS>
this
be
resolve
upon
,
my
wife
undertake
to
manage
the
business
herself
,
as
she
really
have
some
talent
for
such
an
undertaking
.
<EOS>
We
see
him
approach
,
he
enter
,
draw
a
chair
,
and
sate
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
fine
day
,
Mr
Burchell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
very
fine
day
,
Doctor
;
though
I
fancy
we
shall
have
some
rain
by
the
shooting
of
my
corn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
shooting
of
your
horn
,
"
cry
my
wife
,
in
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
,
and
then
ask
pardon
for
be
fond
of
a
joke
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
madam
,
"
reply
he
,
"
I
pardon
you
with
all
my
heart
;
for
I
protest
I
should
not
have
think
it
a
joke
<EOS>
have
you
not

me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
,
Sir
,
"
cry
my
wife
,
wink
at
us
,
"
and
yet
I
dare
say
you
can
tell
us
how
many
joke
go
to
an
ounce
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
madam
,
"
return
Burchell
,
"
you
have
be
read
a
jest
book
this
morning
,
that
ounce
of
joke
be
so
very
good
a
conceit
;
and
yet
,
madam
<EOS>
,
I
have
rather
see
half
an
ounce
of
understanding
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
may
,
"
cry
my
wife
,
still
smile
at
us
,
though
the
laugh
be
against
her
;
"
and
yet
I
have
see
some
man
pretend
to
understand
that
have
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
no
doubt
,
"
reply
her
antagonist
,
"
you
have
know
lady
set
up
for
wit
that
have
none
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
quickly
begin
to
find
that
my
wife
be
likely
to
gain
but
little
at
this
business
;
so
I
resolve
to
treat
him
in
a
stile
of
more
severity
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
both
wit
and
understanding
"
cry
I
,
"
be
trifle
,
without
integrity
:
it
be
that
which
give
value
to
every
character
.
<EOS>
the
ignorant
peasant
,
without
fault
,
be
great
than
the
philosopher
with
many
;
for
what
be
genius
or
courage
without
an
heart
?
<EOS>
an
honest
man
be
the
noble
work
of
God
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
hold
that
hackney'd
maxim
of
Pope
,
"
return
Mr
Burchell
,
"
as
very
unworthy
a
man
of
genius
,
and
a
base
desertion
of
his
own
superiority
.
<EOS>
as
the
reputation
of
book
be
raise
not
by
their
freedom
from
defect
,
but
the
greatness
of
their
beauty
;
so
should
that
of
man
be
prize
not
for
their
exemption
from
fault
,
but
the
size
of
those
virtue
they
be
possess
of
.
<EOS>
the
scholar
may
want
prudence
,
the
statesman
may
have
pride
,
and
the
champion
ferocity
;
but
shall
we
prefer
to
these
the
low
mechanic
,
who
laboriously
plod
on
through
life
,
without
censure
or
applause
?
<EOS>
We
may
as
well
prefer
the
tame
correct
painting
of
the
flemish
school
to
the
erroneous
,
but
sublime
animation
of
the
roman
pencil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
reply
I
,
"
<EOS>
your
present
observation
be
just
,
when
there
be
shine
virtue
and
minute
defect
;
but
when
it
appear
that
great
vice
be
oppose
in
the
same
mind
to
as
extraordinary
virtue
,
such
a
character
deserve
contempt
.
"
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
cry
he
,
"
there
may
be
some
such
monster
as
you
describe
,
of
great
vice
join
to
great
virtue
;
yet
in
my
progress
through
life
,
I
never
yet
find
one
instance
of
their
existence
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
ever
perceive
,
that
where
the
mind
be
capacious
,
the
affection
be
good
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
Providence
seem
kindly
our
friend
in
this
particular
,
thus
to
debilitate
the
understanding
where
the
heart
be
corrupt
,
and
diminish
the
power
where
there
be
the
will
to
do
mischief
.
<EOS>
this
rule
seem
to
extend
even
to
other
animal
:
the
little
vermin
race
be
ever
treacherous
,
cruel
,
and
cowardly
,
whilst
those
endow
with
strength
and
power
be
generous
,
brave
,
and
gentle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
these
observation
sound
well

"
return
I
,
"
and
yet
it
would
be
easy
this
moment
to
point
out
a
man
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
fix
my
eye
stedfastly
upon
him
,
"
whose
head
and
heart
form
a
most
detestable
contrast

<EOS>

Sir

continue
I

raise
my
voice

I
be
glad

security

<EOS>
do
you

<EOS>

this

<EOS>
nay

me
full
in

yes

it

reply
he
,
with
look

unparallelled
effrontery
,
"
so
basely
to
presume
to
break
open
this
letter

<EOS>
do
not
you

now

I

hang
you
all

<EOS>
all
that
I

that
you

open

up

"
this
piece
of
unexpected
insolence
raise
me
to
such
a
pitch

that
I
could
scare
govern
my
passion

ungrateful
wretch

never

me
see
thee
again

go
from
my
door

and
the
only
punishment
I
wish
thee
be
an
allarmed
conscience

which
will
be
a
sufficient
tormentor

<EOS>
so
say
,
I
throw
him
his
pocket
-
book
,
which
he
take
up
with
a
smile
,
and
shut
the
clasp
with
the
utmost
composure
,
leave
us
,
quite
astonished
at
the
serenity
of
his
assurance
.
<EOS>
My
wife
be
particularly
enrage
that
nothing
could
make
him
angry
,
or
make
him
seem
ashamed
of
his
villainy
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear

"
cry
I
,
willing
to
calm
those
passion
that
have
be
raise
too
high
among

"
we
be
not
to
be
surprised
that
bad
man
want
shame
;
they
only
blush
at
be
detect
in

good

but
glory
in
their
vice

<EOS>
"
guilt
and
shame

say
the
allegory
,
be
at
first
companion
,
and
in
the
beginning
of
their
journey
inseparably
keep
together
.
<EOS>
but
their
union
be
soon
find
to
be
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
to
both
;
guilt
give
shame
frequent
uneasiness
,
and
shame
often
betray
the
secret
conspiracy
of
guilt
.
<EOS>
after
long
disagreeement

therefore

they
at
length
consent

guilt
boldly
walk
forward
alone

back

company
with
virtue

which
,
in
the

they
have
leave
behind

<EOS>
thus

my

after
man
have
travel
through
a
few
stage
in
vice

shame
forsake
them

<EOS>
the

with
,
still
great
  
<EOS>
whatever
may
have

Sophia

easily
console

for
Mr

absence
by
the
company

<EOS>
though

procure
my

the
amusement

he
take
every
opportunity

supply
them
with
those
little
recreation

He

He
could
repeat
all
the
observation
that
be

in
the
atmosphere
of
the
playhouse

and
have
all
the
good
thing
of
the
high
wit
by
rote
long
before
they
make
way
into
the
jest

book

<EOS>
the
interval
between
conversation
be
employ
in
teach
my
daughter
piquet
,
or
sometimes
in
set
my
two
little
one
to
box
to
make
them
sharp

as
he
call
it

but
the
hope
of
have
him
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
,
in
some
measure
blind
us
to
all
his
imperfection

<EOS>
It
must
be
own
that
my
wife
lay
a
thousand
scheme
to
entrap
him
,
or
,
to
speak
it
more
tenderly
,
use
every
art
to
magnify
the
merit
of
her
daughter

<EOS>
if
the
cake
at
tea
eat
short

crisp

they
be
make
by
Olivia
:
if
the
gooseberry
wine
be
well
knit

the
gooseberry
be
of
her
gathering

it
be
her
finger
which
give
the
pickle
their
peculiar
green
;
and
in
the
composition
of
a
pudding
,
it
be
her
judgment
that
mix'd
the
ingredient

<EOS>
then
the
poor
woman
would
sometimes
tell
the

Squire

that
she
think
him

Olivia
extremely
of
a
size

would
bid
both
stand
up

be
tall

<EOS>
these
instance
of
cunning
,
which
she
think
impenetrable
,
yet
which
every
body
see
through
,
be
very
pleasing
to
our

some
new
proof

his
passion

which
though
they
have
not
arise
to
proposal

yet
we
think
fall
but
little
short
of
it

and
his
slowness
be
attribute
sometimes
to
native
bashfulness

sometimes
to
his
fear

offend
his
uncle

<EOS>
an
occurrence

as
this
family
and
our
have
long
a
sort
of
rivalry
in
point
of
taste
,
our
spirit
take
the
alarm
at
this
steal
march
upon
us
,
and
notwithstanding
all
I
could
say
,
and
I
say
much
,
it
be
resolve
that
we
should
have
our
picture
do
too
.
<EOS>
have
,
therefore
,
engage
the
limner
,
for
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
our
next
deliberation
be
to
shew
the
superiority
of
our
taste
in
the
attitude
.
<EOS>
as
for
our
neighbour
's
family
,
there
be
seven
of
them
,
and
they
be
draw
with
seven
orange
,
a
thing
quite
out
of
taste
,
no
variety
in
life
,
no
composition
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
We
desire
to
have
something
in
a
bright
style
,
and
,
after
many
debate
,
at
length
come
to
an
unanimous
resolution
of
be
draw
together
,
in
one
large
historical
family
piece
.
<EOS>
this
would
be
cheap
,
since
one
frame
would
serve
for
all
,
and
it
would
be
infinitely
more
genteel
;
for
all
family
of
any
taste
be
now
draw
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
as
we
do
not
immediately
recollect
an
historical
subject
to
hit
us
,
we
be
content
each
with
be
draw
as
independent
historical
figure
.
<EOS>
My
wife
desire
to
be
represent
as
Venus
,
and
the
painter
be
desire
not
to
be
too
frugal
of
his
diamond
in
her
stomacher
and
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
two
little
one
be
to
be
as
Cupids
by
her
side
,
while
I
,
in
my
gown
and
band
,
be
to
present
her
with
my
book
on
the
whistonian
controversy
.
<EOS>
Olivia
would
be
draw
as
an
Amazon
,
sit
upon
a
bank
of
flower
,
dr
in
a
green
joseph
,
richly
lace
with
gold
,
and
a
whip
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Sophia
be
to
be
a
shepherdess
,
with
as
many
sheep
as
the
painter
could
put
in
for
nothing
;
and
Moses
be
to
be
dr
out
with
an
hat
and
white
feather
.
<EOS>
Our
taste
so
much
pleased
the
"
Squire
,
that
he
insist
on
be
put
in
as
one
of
the
family
in
the
character
of
Alexander
<EOS>
the
great
,
at
Olivia
's
foot
.
<EOS>
this
be
consider
by
us
all
as
an
indication
of
his
desire
to
be
introduce
into
the
family
,
nor
could
we
refuse
his
request
.
<EOS>
the
painter
be
therefore
set
to
work
,
and
as
he
work
with
assiduity
and
expedition
,
in
less
than
four
day
the
whole
be
compleate
.
<EOS>
the
piece
be
large
,
and
it
must
be
own
he
do
not
spare
his
colour
;
for
which
my
wife
give
him
great
encomium
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
performance
;
but
an
unfortunate
circumstance
have
not
occur
till
the
picture
be
finish
,
which
now
strike
us
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
very
large
that
we
have
no
place
in
the
house
to
fix
it
.
<EOS>
how
we
all
come
to
disregard
so
material
a
point
be
inconceivable
;
but
certain
it
be
,
we
have
be
all
greatly
remiss
.
<EOS>
the
picture
,
therefore
,
instead
of
gratify
our
vanity
,
as
we
hope
,
lean
,
in
a
most
mortifying
manner
,
against
the
kitchen
wall
,
where
the
canvas
be
stretch
and
paint
,
much
too
large
to
be
get
through
any
of
the
door
,
and
the
jest
of
all
our
neighhour
.
<EOS>
one
compare
it
to
Robinson
Crusoe
's
long
-
boat
,
too
large
to
be
remove
;
another
think
it
more
resemble
a
reel
in
a
bottle
;
some
wonder
how
it
could
be
get
out
,
but
still
more
be
amazed
how
it
ever
get
in
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
it
excite
the
ridicule
of
some
,
it
effectually
raise
more
malicious
suggestion
in
many
.
<EOS>
the
"
Squire
's
portrait
be
find
united
with
our
,
be
an
honour
too
great
to
escape
envy
.
<EOS>
scandalous
whisper
begin
to
circulate
at
our
expence
,
and
our
tranquility
be
continually
disturb
by
person
who
come
as
friend
to
tell
us
what
be
say
of
us
by
enemy
.
<EOS>
these
report
we
always
resent
with
become
spirit
;
but
scandal
ever
improve
by
opposition
.
  
<EOS>
We
once
again
therefore
enter
into
a
consultation
upon
obviate
the
malice
of
our
enemy
,
and
at
last
come
to
a
resolution
which
have
too
much
cunne
to
give
me
entire
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
:
as
our
principal
object
be
to
discover
the
honour
of
Mr
Thornhill
's
address
,
my
wife
undertake
to
sound
him
,
by
pretend
to
ask
his
advice
in
the
choice
of
an
husband
for
her
eld
daughter
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
not
find
sufficient
to
induce
him
to
a
declaration
,
it
be
then
resolve
to
terrify
him
with
a
rival
.
<EOS>
to
this
last
step
,
however
,
I
would
by
no
mean
give
my
consent
,
till
Olivia
give
me
the
most
solemn
assurance
that
she
would
marry
the
person
provide
to
rival
him
upon
this
occasion
,
if
he
do
not
prevent
it
,
by
take
her
himself
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
scheme
lay
,
which
though
I
do
not
strenuously
oppose
,
I
do
not
entirely
approve
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
time
,
therefore
,
that
Mr
Thornhill
come
to
see
us
,
my
girl
take
care
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
in
order
to
give
their
mamma
an
opportunity
of
put
her
scheme
in
execution
;
but
they
only
retire
to
the
next
room
,
from
whence
they
could
over
-
hear
the
whole
conversation
:
<EOS>
My
wife
artfully
introduce
it
,
by
observe
,
that
one
of
the
Miss
Flamboroughs
be
like
to
have
a
very
good
match
of
it
in
Mr
Spanker
.
<EOS>
to
this
the
"
Squire
assenting
,
she
proceed
to
remark
,
that
they
who
have
warm
fortune
be
always
sure
of
get
good
husband
:
"
<EOS>
but
heaven
help
,
"
continue
she
,
"
the
girl
that
have
none
.
<EOS>
what
signify
beauty
,
Mr
Thornhill
?
<EOS>
or
what
signify
all
the
virtue
,
and
all
the
qualification
in
the
world
,
in
this
age
of
self
-
interest
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
what
be
she
?
<EOS>
but
what
have
she
?
<EOS>
be
all
the
cry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
return
he
,
"
I
highly
approve
the
justice
,
as
well
as
the
novelty
,
of
your
remark
,
and
if
I
be
a
king
,
it
should
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
It
should
then
,
indeed
,
be
fine
time
with
the
girl
without
fortune
:
our
two
young
lady
should
be
the
first
for
whom
I
would
provide
.
"
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Sir
!
"
return
my
wife
,
"
you
be
pleased
to
be
facetious
:
but
I
wish
I
be
a
queen
,
and
then
I
know
where
my
eld
daughter
should
look
for
an
husband
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
that
you
have
put
it
into
my
head
,
seriously
Mr
Thornhill
,
can
not
you
recommend
me
a
proper
husband
for
her
?
<EOS>
She
be
now
nineteen
year
old

well
grown

well
educated

and
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
do
not

for
part

<EOS>

Madam

he
,
"
if
I
be
to
chuse
,
I
would
find
out

happy

with
prudence

fortune

and
sincerity

such

would
be

in
my

but
do
you

any
such

<EOS>
"
no

return
he
,
"
it
be
impossible
to
know
any
person
that
deserve

be
her
husband

she
be
too
great
a
treasure

one
man

possession

she
be
a
goddess

<EOS>
upon

I

<EOS>

ah
,
Mr
Thornhill
,
you
only
flatter
my
poor
girl

but
we
have
be

of
marry

to
one
of
your
tenant

whose

lately
dead

and
who

able
to
give
her
good
bread

who

several
time
make

(
which

actually
the
case

he

"

lie

deep
for

<EOS>
(

rivette
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
he
be
go
,
upon
general
consultation
,
we
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
these
fine
sentiment
.
<EOS>
Olivia
consider
them
as
instance
of
the
most
exalted
passion
;
but
I
be
not
quite
so
sanguine
<EOS>
:
it
seem
to
me
pretty
plain
,
that
they
have
more
of
love
than
matrimony
in
them
:
yet
,
whatever
they
may
portend
,
it
be
resolve
to
prosecute
the
scheme
of
farmer
Williams
,
who
,
from
my
daughter
's
first
appearance
in
the
country
,
have
pay
her
his
address
.
     
<EOS>
Scarce
any
virtue
find
to
resist
the
power
of
long
and
pleasing
temptation
   
<EOS>
as
I
only
study
my
child
's
real
happiness
,
the
assiduity
of
Mr
Williams
please
me
,
as
he
be
in
easy
circumstance
,
prudent
,
and
sincere
.
<EOS>
It
require
but
very
little
encouragement
to
revive
his
former
passion
;
so
that
in
an
evening
or
two
he
and
Mr
Thornhill
meet
at
our
house
,
and
survey
each
other
for
some
time
with
look
of
anger
:
but
Williams
owe
his
landlord
no
rent
,
and
little
regard
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
Olivia
,
on
her
side
,
act
the
coquet
to
perfection
,
if
that
may
be
call
acting
which
be
her
real
character
,
pretend
to
lavish
all
her
tenderness
on
her
new
lover
.
<EOS>
Mr
Thornhill
appear
quite
dejected
at
this
preference
,
and
with
a
pensive
air
take
leave
,
though
I
own
it
puzzle
me
to
find
him
so
much
in
pain
as
he
appear
to
be
,
when
he
have
it
in
his
power
so
easily
to
remove
the
cause
,
by
declare
an
honourable
passion
.
<EOS>
but
whatever
uneasiness
he
seem
to
endure
,
it
could
easily
be
perceive
that
Olivia
's
anguish
be
still
great
.
<EOS>
after
any
of
these
interview
between
her
lover
,
of
which
there
be
several
,
she
usually
retire
to
solitude
,
and
there
indulge
her
grief
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
such
a
situation
I
find
her
one
evening
,
after
she
have
be
for
some
time
support
a
fictitious
gayety
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
now
see
,
my
child
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
your
confidence
in
Mr
Thornhill
's
passion
be
all
a
dream
<EOS>
:
he
permit
the
rivalry
of
another
,
every
way
his
inferior
,
though
he
know
it
lie
in
his
power
to
secure
you
to
himself
by
a
candid
declaration
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
pappa
,
"
return
she
,
"
but
he
have
his
reason
for
this
delay
:
<EOS>
I
know
he
have
.
<EOS>
the
sincerity
of
his
look
and
word
convince
me
of
his
real
esteem
.
<EOS>
a
short
time
,
I
hope
,
will
discover
the
generosity
of
his
sentiment
,
and
convince
you
that
my
opinion
of
him
have
be
more
just
than
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Olivia
,
my
darling
,
"
return
I
,
"
every
scheme
that
have
be
hitherto
pursue
to
compel
him
to
a
declaration
,
have
be
propose
and
plan
by
yourself
,
nor
can
you
in
the
least
<EOS>
say
that
I
have
constrain
you
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
suppose
,
my
dear
,
that
I
will
ever
be
instrumental
in
suffer
his
honest
rival
to
be
the
dupe
of
your
ill
-
place
passion
.
<EOS>
whatever
time
you
require
to
bring
your
fancied
admirer
to
an
explanation
shall
be
grant
;
but
at
the
expiration
of
that
term
,
if
he
be
still
regardless
,
I
must
absolutely
insist
that
honest
Mr
Williams
shall
be
reward
for
his
fidelity
.
<EOS>
the
character
which
I
have
hitherto
support
in
life
demand
this
from
me
,
and
my
tenderness
,
as
a
parent
,
shall
never
influence
my
integrity
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
name
then
your
day
,
let
it
be
as
distant
as
you
think
proper
,
and
in
the
mean
time
take
care
to
let
Mr
Thornhill
know
the
exact
time
on
which
I
design
deliver
you
up
to
another
.
<EOS>
if
he
really
love
you
,
his
own
good
sense
will
readily
suggest
that
there
be
but
one
method
alone
to
prevent
his
lose
you
forever
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
proposal
,
which
she
could
not
avoid
consider
as
perfectly
just
,
be
readily
agree
to
.
<EOS>
She
again
renew
her
most
positive
promise
of
marry
Mr
Williams
,
in
case
of
the
other
's
insensibility
;
and
at
the
next
opportunity
,
in
Mr
Thornhill
's
presence
,
that
day
month
be
fix
upon
for
her
nuptial
with
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
such
vigorous
proceeding
seem
to
redouble
Mr
Thornhill
's
anxiety
:
but
what
Olivia
really
feel
give
me
some
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
in
this
struggle
between
prudence
and
passion
,
her
vivacity
quite
forsake
her
,
and
every
opportunity
of
solitude
be
seek
,
and
spend
in
tear
.
<EOS>
one
week
pass
away
;
but
Mr
Thornhill
make
no
effort
to
restrain
her
nuptial
.
<EOS>
the
succeed
week
he
be
still
assiduous
;
but
not
more
open
.
<EOS>
on
the
third
he
discontinue
his
visit
entirely
,
and
instead
of
my
daughter
testify
any
impatience
,
as
I
expect
,
she
seem
to
retain
a
pensive
tranquillity
,
which
I
look
upon
as
resignation
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
be
now
sincerely
pleased
with
think
that
my
child
be
go
to
be
secure
in
a
continuance
of
competence
and
peace
,
and
frequently
applaud
her
resolution
,
in
prefer
happiness
to
ostentation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
within
about
four

the

never
look
strait

the

blow
out

candle

that
there
be
none
of

of

the

the

Colin

he
give
her
a
fairing

she
present
him
with
a

then
they
go
together

"
     
<EOS>
the
pursuit
of
a
father
to
reclaim
a
lose
child
to
virtue
  
<EOS>
tho
'
the
child
could
not
describe
the
gentleman
's
person
who
hand
his
sister
into
the
post
-
chaise
,
yet
my
suspicion
fall
entirely
upon
our
young
landlord
,
whose
character
for
such
intrigue
be
but
too
well
known
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
direct
my
step
towards
thornhill
-
castle
,
resolve
to
upbraid
him
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
bring
back
my
daughter
:
<EOS>
but
before
I
have
reach
his
seat
,
I
be
meet
by
one
of
my
parishioner
,
who
say
he
see
a
young
lady
resemble
my
daughter
in
a
post
-
chaise
with
a
gentleman
,
whom
,
by
the
description
,
I
could
only
guess
to
be
Mr
Burchell
,
and
that
they
drive
very
fast
.
<EOS>
this
information
,
however
,
do
by
no
means
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
go
to
the
young
"
Squire
's
,
and
though
it
be
yet
early
,
insist
upon
see
him
immediately
:
he
soon
appear
with
the
most
open
familiar
air
,
and
seem
perfectly
amazed
at
my
daughter
's
elopement
,
protest
upon
his
honour
that
he
be
quite
a
stranger
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
now
therefore
condemn
my
former
suspicion
,
and
could
turn
them
only
on
Mr
Burchell
,
who
I
recollect
have
of
late
several
private
conference
with
her
:
<EOS>
but
the
appearance
of
another
witness
leave
me
no
room
to
doubt
of
his
villainy
,
who
aver
,
that
he
and
my
daughter
be
actually
go
towards
the
well
,
about
thirty
mile
off
,
where
there
be
a
great
deal
of
company
.
<EOS>
be
drive
to
that
state
of
mind
in
which
we
be
more
ready
to
act
precipitately
than
to
reason
right
,
I
never
debate
with
myself
,
whether
these
account
may
not
have
be
give
by
person
purposely
place
in
my
way
,
to
mislead
me
,
but
resolve
to
pursue
my
daughter
and
her
fancied
deluder
thither
.
<EOS>
I
walk
along
with
earnestness
,
and
enquire
of
several
by
the
way
;
but
receive
no
account
,
till
enter
the
town
,
I
be
meet
by
a
person
on
horseback
,
whom
I
remember
to
have
see
at
the
"
Squire
's
,
and
he
assure
me
that
if
I
follow
them
to
the
race
,
which
be
but
thirty
mile
farther
,
I
may
depend
upon
overtake
them
;
for
he
have
see
them
dance
there
the
night
before
,
and
the
whole
assembly
seem
charm
with
my
daughter
's
performance
.
<EOS>
early
the
next
day
I
walk
forward
to
the
race
,
and
about
four
in
the
afternoon
<EOS>
I
come
upon
the
course
.
<EOS>
the
company
make
a
very
brilliant
appearance
,
all
earnestly
employ
in
one
pursuit
,
that
of
pleasure
;
how
different
from
mine
,
that
of
reclaim
a
lose
child
to
virtue
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
perceive
Mr
Burchell
at
some
distance
from
me
;
but
,
as
if
he
dread
an
interview
,
upon
my
approach
him
,
he
mix
among
a
crowd
,
and
I
see
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
now
reflect
that
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
to
continue
my
pursuit
farther
,
and
resolve
to
return
home
to
an
innocent
family
,
who
want
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
but
the
agitation
of
my
mind
,
and
the
fatigue
I
have
undergo
,
throw
me
into
a
fever
,
the
symptom
of
which
I
perceive
before
I
come
off
the
course
.
<EOS>
this
be
another
unexpected
stroke
,
as
I
be
more
than
seventy
mile
distant
from
home
:
however
,
I
retire
to
a
little
ale
-
house
by
the
road
-
side
,
and
in
this
place
,
the
usual
retreat
of
indigence
and
frugality
,
I
lay
me
down
patiently
to
wait
the
issue
of
my
disorder
.
<EOS>
I
languish
here
for
near
three
week
;
but
at
last
my
constitution
prevail
,
though
I
be
unprovided
with
money
to
defray
the
expence
of
my
entertainment
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
the
anxiety
from
this
last
circumstance
alone
may
have
bring
on
a
relapse
,
have
I
not
be
supply
by
a
traveller
,
who
stopt
to
take
a
cursory
refreshment
.
<EOS>
this
person
be
no
other
than
the
philanthropic
bookseller
in
St
Paul
's
church
-
yard
,
who
have
write
so
many
little
book
for
child
:
he
call
himself
their
friend
;
but
he
be
the
friend
of
all
mankind
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
alighted
,
but
he
be
in
haste
to
be
go
;
for
he
be
ever
on
business
of
the
utmost
importance
,
and
be
at
that
time
actually
compile
material
for
the
history
of
one
Mr
Thomas
Trip
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
recollect
this
good
-
natured
man
's
red
pimple
face
;
for
he
have
publish
for
me
against
the
Deuterogamists
of
the
age
,
and
from
him
I
borrow
a
few
piece
,
to
be
pay
at
my
return
.
<EOS>
leave
the
inn
,
therefore
,
as
I
be
yet
but
weak
,
I
resolve
to
return
home
by
easy
journie
of
ten
mile
a
day
.
<EOS>
My
health
and
usual
tranquillity
be
almost
restore
,
and
I
now
condemn
that
pride
which
have
make
me
refractory
to
the
hand
of
correction
.
<EOS>
man
little
know
what
calamity
be
beyond
his
patience
to
bear
till
he
try
them
;
as
in
ascend
the
height
of
ambition
,
which
look
bright
from
below
,
every
step
we
rise
shew
us
<EOS>
some
new
and
gloomy
prospect
of
hide
disappointment
;
so
in
our
descent
from
the
summit
of
pleasure
,
though
the
vale
of
misery
below
may
appear
at
first
dark
and
gloomy
,
yet
the
busy
mind
,
still
attentive
to
its
own
amusement
,
find
as
we
descend
something
to
flatter
and
to
please
.
<EOS>
still
as
we
approach
,
the
dark
object
appear
to
brighten
,
and
the
mental
eye
become
adapt
to
its
gloomy
situation
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
proceed
forward
,
and
have
walk
about
two
hour
,
when
I
perceive
what
appear
at
a
distance
like
a
waggon
,
which
I
be
resolve
to
overtake
;
but
when
I
come
up
with
it
,
find
it
to
be
a
stroll
company
's
cart
,
that
be
carry
their
scene
and
other
theatrical
furniture
to
the
next
village
,
where
they
be
to
exhibit
.
<EOS>
the
cart
be
attend
only
by
the
person
who
drive
it
,
and
one
of
the
company
,
as
the
rest
of
the
player
be
to
follow
the
ensue
day
.
<EOS>
good
company
upon
the
road
,
say
the
proverb
,
be
the
short
cut
,
I
therefore
enter
into
conversation
with
the
poor
player
;
and
as
I
once
have
some
theatrical
power
myself
,
I
disserte
on
such
topic
with
my
usual
freedom
:
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
pretty
much
unacquainted
with
the
present
state
of
the
stage
,
I
demand
who
be
the
present
theatrical
writer
in
vogue
,
who
the
Drydens
and
Otways
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
Sir
,
"
cry
the
player
,
"
few
of
our
modern
dramatist
would
think
themselves
much
honour
by
be
compare
to
the
writer
you
mention
.
<EOS>
Dryden
and
Row
's
manner
,
Sir
,
be
quite
out
of
fashion
;
our
taste
have
go
back
a
whole
century
,
Fletcher
,
Ben
Johnson
,
and
all
the
play
of
Shakespear
,
be
the
only
thing
that
go
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
,
"
cry
I
,
"
be
it
possible
the
present
age
can
be
pleased
with
that
antiquated
dialect
,
that
obsolete
humour
,
those
overcharge
character
,
which
abound
in
the
work
you
mention
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
return
my
companion
,
"
the
public
think
nothing
about
dialect
,
or
humour
,
or
character
;
for
that
be
none
of
their
business
,
they
only
go
to
be
amuse
,
and
find
themselves
happy
when
they
can
enjoy
a
pantomime
,
under
the
sanction
of
Johnson
's
or
Shakespear
's
name
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
then
,
I
suppose
,
"
cry
I
,
"
that
our
modern
dramatist
be
rather
imitator
of
Shakespear
than
of
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
say
the
truth
,
"
return
my
companion
,
"
I
do
not
know
that
they
imitate
any
thing
at
all
;
nor
,
indeed
do
the
public
require
it
of
them
:
it
be
not
the
composition
of
the
piece
,
but
the
number
of
start
and
attitude
that
may
be
introduce
into
it
that
elicit
applause
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
piece
,
with
not
one
jest
in
the
whole
,
shrug
into
popularity
,
and
another
save
by
the
poet
's
throwing
in
a
fit
of
the
gripe
.
<EOS>
no
,
Sir
,
the
work
of
Congreve
and
Farquhar
have
too
much
wit
in
them
for
the
present
taste
;
our
modern
dialect
be
much
more
natural
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
equipage
of
the
stroll
company
be
arrive
at
the
village
,
which
,
it
seem
,
have
be
apprise
of
our
approach
,
and
be
come
out
to
gaze
at
us
;
for
my
companion
observe
,
that
stroller
always
have
more
spectator
without
door
than
within
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
consider
the
impropriety
of
my
being
in
such
company
till
I
see
a
mob
gather
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
take
shelter
,
as
fast
as
possible
,
in
the
first
ale
-
house
that
offer
,
and
be
shew
into
the
common
room

be
accost
by
a
very
well

demand
whether
I
be
the
real
chaplain
of
the
company
,
or
whether
it
be
only
to
be
my
masquerade
character
in
the
play

<EOS>
upon
inform
him
of
the
truth
,
and
that
I
do
not
belong
in
any
sort
to
the
company
,
he
be
condescend
enough
to
desire
me
and
the
player
to
partake
in
a
bowl
of
punch
,
over
which
he
discuss
modern
politic
with
great
earnestness
and
interest
.
<EOS>
I
set
him
down
in
my
mind
for
nothing
less
than
a
parliament
-
man
at
least
;
but
be
almost
confirm
in
my
conjecture

when
upon
my
ask
what
there
be
in
the
house
for
supper

he
insist
that
the

should
sup
with

he
,
sit
upon
his
shoulder
in
turn
.
<EOS>
since
then
it
be
entail
upon
humanity
to
submit
,
and
some
be
bear
to
command
,
and
other
to
obey
,
the
question
be
,
as
there
must
be
tyrant
,
whether
it
be
well
to
have
them
in
the
same
house
with
us
,
or
in
the
same
village
,
or
still
farther
off
,
in
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
,
for
my
own
part
,
as
I
naturally
hate
the
face
of
a
tyrant
,
the
farther
off
he
be
remove
from
me
,
the
better
pleased
be
I.
<EOS>
the
generality
of
mankind
also
be
of
my
way
of
thinking
,
and
have
unanimously
create
one
king
,
whose
election
at
once
diminish
the
number
of
tyrant
,
and
put
tyranny
at
the
great
distance
from
the
great
number
of
people
.
<EOS>
now
the
great
who
be
tyrant
themselves
before
the
election
of
one
tyrant
,
be
naturally
averse
to
a
power
raise
over
them
,
and
whose
weight
must
ever
lean
heaviest
on
the
subordinate
order
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
interest
of
the
great
,
therefore
,
to
diminish
kingly
power
as
much
as
possible
;
because
whatever
they
take
from
that
be
naturally
restore
to
themselves
;
and
all
they
have
to
do
in
the
state
,
be
to
undermine
the
single
tyrant
,
by
which
they
resume
their
primaeval
authority
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
state
may
be
so
circumstance
,
or
<EOS>
its
law
may
be
so
disposed
,
or
its
man
of
opulence
so
minded
,
as
all
to
conspire
in
carry
on
this
business
of
undermine
monarchy
.
<EOS>
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
if
the
circumstance
of
our
state
be
such
,
as
to
favour
the
accumulation
of
wealth
,
and
make
the
opulent
still
more
rich
,
this
will
encrease
their
ambition
.
<EOS>
an
accumulation
of
wealth
,
however
,
must
necessarily
be
the
consequence
,
when
as
at
present
more
riches
flow
in
from
external
commerce
,
than
arise
from
internal
industry
:
for
external
commerce
can
only
be
manage
to
advantage
by
the
rich
,
and
they
have
also
at
the
same
time
all
the
emolument
arise
from
internal
industry
:
so
that
the
rich
,
with
us
,
have
two
source
of
wealth
,
whereas
the
poor
have
but
one
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
wealth
in
all
commercial
state
be
find
to
accumulate
,
and
all
such
have
hitherto
in
time
become
aristocratical
.
<EOS>
again
,
the
very
law
also
of
this
country
may
contribute
to
the
accumulation
of
wealth
;
as
when
by
their
mean
the
natural
tie
that
bind
the
rich
and
poor
together
be
break
,
and
it
be
ordain
that
the
rich
shall
only
marry
with
the
rich
;
or
when
the
learn
be
hold
unqualified
to
serve
their
country
as
counsellor
merely
from
a
defect
of
opulence
,
and
wealth
be
thus
make
the
object
of
a
wise
man
's
ambition
;
by
these
mean
I
say
,
and
such
mean
as
these
,
rich
will
accumulate
.
<EOS>
now
the
possessor
of
accumulate
wealth
,
when
furnish
with
the
necessary
and
pleasure
of
life
,
have
no
other
method
to
employ
the
superfluity
of
his
fortune
but
in
purchase
power
.
<EOS>
that
is
,
differently
speak
,
in
make
dependent
,
by
purchase
the
liberty
of
the
needy
or
the
venal
,
of
man
who
be
willing
to
bear
the
mortification
of
contiguous
tyranny
for
bread
.
<EOS>
thus
each
very
opulent
man
generally
gather
round
him
a
circle
of
the
poor
of
the
people
;
and
the
polity
abound
in
accumulate
wealth
,
may
be
compare
to
a
cartesian
system
,
each
orb
with
a
vortex
of
its
own
.
<EOS>
those
,
however
,
who
be
willing
to
move
in
a
great
man
's
vortex
,
be
only
such
as
must
be
slave
,
the
rabble
of
mankind
,
whose
soul
and
whose
education
be
adapt
to
servitude
,
and
who
know
nothing
of
liberty
except
the
name
.
<EOS>
but
there
must
still
be
a
large
number
of
the
people
without
the
sphere
of
the
opulent
man
's
influence
,
namely
,
that
order
of
man
which
subsist
between
the
very
rich
and
the
very
rabble
;
those
man
who
be
poss
of
too
large
fortune
to
submit
to
the
neighbour
man
in
power
,
and
yet
be
too
poor
to
set
up
for
tyranny
themselves
.
<EOS>
in
this
middle
order
of
mankind
be
generally
to
be
find
all
the
art
,
wisdom
,
and
virtue
of
society
.
<EOS>
this
order
alone
be
know
to
be
the
true
preserver
of
freedom
,
and
may
be
call
the
People
.
<EOS>
now
it
may
happen
that
this
middle
order
of
mankind
may
lose
all
its
influence
in
a
state
,
and
its
voice
be
in
a
manner
drown
in
that
of
the
rabble
:
<EOS>
for
if
the
fortune
sufficient
for
qualify
a
person
at
present
to
give
his
voice
in
state
affair
,
be
ten
time
less
than
be
judge
sufficient
upon
form
the
constitution
,
it
be
evident
that
great
number
of
the
rabble
will
thus
be
introduce
into
the
political
system
,
and
they
ever
move
in
the
vortex
of
the
great
,
will
follow
where
greatness
shall
direct
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
state
,
therefore
,
all
that
the
middle
order
have
leave
,
be
to
preserve
the
prerogative
and
privilege
of
the
one
principal
governor
with
the
most
sacred
circumspection
.
<EOS>
for
he
divide
the
power
of
the
rich
,
and
call
off
the
great
from
fall
with
tenfold
weight
on
the
middle
order
place
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
the
middle
order
may
be
compare
to
a
town
of
which
the
opulent
be
form
the
siege
,
and
which
the
governor
from
without
be
hasten
the
relief
.
<EOS>
while
the
besieger
be
in
dread
of
an
enemy
over
them
,
it
be
but
natural
to
offer
the
townsman
the
most
specious
term
;
to
flatter
them
with
sound
,
and
amuse
them
with
privilege
:
but
if
they
once
defeat
the
governor
from
behind
,
the
wall
of
the
town
will
be
but
a
small
defence
to
its
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
what
they
may
then
expect
,
may
be
see
by
turn
our
eye
to
Holland
,
Genoa
,
or
Venice
,
where
the
law
govern
the
poor
,
and
the
rich
govern
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
be
then
for
,
and
would
die
for
,
monarchy
,
sacred
monarchy
;
for
if
there
be
any
thing
sacred
amongst
man
,
it
must
be
the
anoint
sovereign
of
his
people
,
and
every
diminution
of
his
power
in
war
,
or
in
peace
,
be
an
infringement
upon
the
real
liberty
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
sound
of
liberty
,
patriotism
,
and
Britons
,
have
already
do
much
,
it
be
to
be
hope
that
the
true
son
of
freedom
will
prevent
their
ever
do
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
many
of
those
pretend
champion
for
liberty
in
my
time
,
yet
do
I
not
remember
one
that
be
not
in
his
heart
and
in
his
family
a
tyrant
.

<EOS>
My
warmth
I

the

as
I

of
too
much
sensibility

I
forbore
a
more
minute
detail
of
our
suffering

<EOS>
It
be

some
consolation
to
me
to
find
that

reject

catch
from

a

prevail
upon
to
accompany

to
the

no

a

as
the
company
with

incontestably
the

be
receive
with
the
great
respect

place
in

front
seat
of
the
theatre

we
sate
for
some
time
with
no

make
his
appearance

advance
at
last

think
of
my

his

perceive
Miss

stand
at

speechless

immoveable

the
actor
behind
the

who
ascribe
this
pause
to
his
natural
timidity

encourage
him

instead
of
go
on

burst
into
a
flood
of
tear

retire
off

not

what
be
my

they
succeed
with
too
much
rapidity

I
be
soon
awake
from
this
disagreeable
reverie
by
Miss
Wilmot

pale

in
his
refusal

appear
again
upon

the
player
put
another
in

him
with

give

the

she

twenty
giddy

that
look
like
joy

and
then
laugh
loud
at
her

of

<EOS>
at

she
would
take
a
sly
peep
at
the
glass
,
as

happy
in
the
consciousness
of
unresisting
beauty

and
often
would

the

Mrs

politely
offer
to
send
a
couple
of
her
footman
for
my

baggage
,
which
he
at
first
seem
to
decline
;
but
upon
her
press
the
request

he
be
oblige
to
inform
her

that
a
stick
and
a
wallet
be
all

of

I

Mrs

that
the
account
of

would
be
amusing

the

could
the

Madam

I

you
the
pleasure

not
be
half
so
great
as
my
vanity

repeat
them
;
and
yet
in
the
whole
narrative
I
can
scarce
promise
you
one
adventure

as
my
account
be
rather
of
what
I
see

what
I
do

<EOS>
the
first
misfortune
of
my
life

which
you
all

it

I.

the

I

every

<EOS>
I
proceed

therefore
,
towards
London
in
a
fine
morning
,
no

uneasy
about
tomorrow

but
chearful
as
the
bird

caroll'd

<EOS>
"
upon
my
arrival
in
town
,
Sir
,
my
first
care
be
to
deliver
your
letter
of
recommendation
to
our
cousin
,
who
be
himself
in
little
well
circumstance
than
I.
<EOS>
My
first
scheme
,
you
know
,
Sir
,
be
to
be
usher
at
an
academy
,
and
I
ask
his
advice
on
the
affair
.
<EOS>
Our
cousin
receive
the
proposal
with
a
true
sardonic
grin
.
<EOS>
aye
,
cry
he
,
this
be
indeed
a
very
pretty
career
,
that
have
be
chalk
out
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
an
usher
at
a
boarding
school
myself
;
and
may
I
die
by
an
anodyne
necklace
,
but
I
have
rather
be
an
under
turnkey
in
Newgate
.
<EOS>
I
be
up
early
and
late
:
<EOS>
I
be
brow-
beat
by
the
master
,
hate
for
my
ugly
face
by
the
mistress
,
worry
by
the
boy
within
,
and
never
permit
to
stir
out
to
meet
civility
abroad
.
<EOS>
but
be
you
sure
you
be
fit
for
a
school
?
<EOS>
let
me
examine
you
a
little
.
<EOS>
have
you
be
breed
apprentice
to
the
business
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
then
you
will
not
do
for
a
school
.
<EOS>
Can
you
dress
the
boy
hair
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
then
you
will
not
do
for
a
school
.
<EOS>
have
you
have
the
small
-
pox
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
then
you
will
not
do
for
a
school
.
<EOS>
Can
you
lie
three
in
a
bed
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
then
you
will
never
do
for
a
school
.
<EOS>
have
you
get
a
good
stomach
?
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
then
you
will
by
no
means
do
for
a
school
.
<EOS>
no
,
Sir
,
if
you
be
for
a
genteel
easy
profession
,
bind
yourself
seven
year
as
an
apprentice
to
turn
a
cutler
's
wheel
;
but
avoid
a
school
by
any
mean
.
<EOS>
yet
come
,
continue
he
<EOS>
,
I
see
you
be
a
lad
of
spirit
and
some
learning
,
what
do
you
think
of
commence
author
,
like
me
?
<EOS>
You
have
read
in
book
,
no
doubt
,
of
man
of
genius
starve
at
the
trade
:
<EOS>
at
present
I
will
shew
you
forty
very
dull
fellow
about
town
that
live
by
it
in
opulence
.
<EOS>
all
honest
joggtrot
man
,
who
go
on
smoothly
and
dully
,
and
write
history
and
politic
,
and
be
praise
;
man
,
Sir
,
who
,
have
they
be
breed
cobler
,
would
all
their
life
have
only
mend
shoe
,
but
never
make
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
find
that
there
be
no
great
degree
of
gentility
affix
to
the
character
of
an
usher
,
I
resolve
to
accept
his
proposal
;
and
have
the
high
respect
for
literature
,
hail
the
antiqua
mater
of
Grub
-
street
with
reverence
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
my
glory
to
pursue
a
track
which
Dryden
and
Otway
tread
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
consider
the
goddess
of
this
region
as
the
parent
of
excellence
;
and
however
an
intercourse
with
the
world
may
give
us
good
sense
,
the
poverty
she
grant
I
suppose
to
be
the
nurse
of
genius
!
<EOS>
big
with
these
reflection
,
I
sate
down
,
and
find
that
the
good
thing
remain
to
be
say
on
the
wrong
side
,
I
resolve
to
write
a
book
that
should
be
wholly
new
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
drest
up
three
paradox
with
some
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
They
be
false
,
indeed
,
but
they
be
new
.
<EOS>
the
jewel
of
truth
have
be
so
often
import
by
other
,
that
nothing
be
leave
for
me
to
import
<EOS>
but
some
splendid
thing
that
at
a
distance
look
every
bit
as
well
.
<EOS>
witness
<EOS>
you
power
what
fancy
importance
sate
perch
upon
my
quill
while
I
be
write
.
<EOS>
the
whole
learned
world
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
would
rise
to
oppose
my
system
;
but
then
I
be
prepared
to
oppose
the
whole
learned
world
.
<EOS>
like
the
porcupine
I
sate
self
collect
,
with
a
quill
point
against
every
opposer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
say
,
my
boy
,
"
cry
I
,
"
and
what
subject
do
you
treat
upon
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
not
pass
over
the
importance
of
Monogamy
.
<EOS>
but
I
interrupt
,
go
on
;
you
publish
your
paradox
;
well
,
and
what
do
the
learned
world
say
to
your
paradox
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
reply
my
son
,
"
the
learned
world
say
nothing
to
my
paradox
;
nothing
at
all
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
every
man
of
them
be
employ
in
praise
his
friend
and
himself
,
or
condemn
his
enemy
;
and
unfortunately
,
as
I
have
neither
,
I
suffer
the
cruell
mortification
,
neglect
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
I
be
meditate
one
day
in
a
coffee
-
house
on
the
fate
of
my
paradox
,
a
little
man
happen
to
enter
the
room
,
place
himself
in
the
box
before
me
,
and
after
some
preliminary
discourse
,
find
me
to
be
a
scholar
,
draw
out
a
bundle
of
proposal
,
beg
me
to
subscribe
to
a
new
edition
he
be
go
to
give
the
world
of
Propertius
,
with
note
.
<EOS>
this
demand
necessarily
produce
a
reply
that
I
have
no
money
;
and
that
concession
lead
him
to
enquire
into
the
nature
of
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
find
that
my
expectation
be
just
as
great
as
my
purse
,
I
see
,
cry
he
,
you
be
unacquainted
with
the
town
,
I
will
teach
you
a
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
look
at
these
proposal
,
upon
these
very
proposal
I
have
subsist
very
comfortably
for
twelve
year
.
<EOS>
the
moment
a
nobleman
return
from
his
travel
,
a
Creolian
arrive
from
Jamaica
,
or
a
dowager
from
her
country
seat
,
I
strike
for
a
subscription
.
<EOS>
I
first
besiege
their
heart
with
flattery
,
and
then
pour
in
my
proposal
at
the
breach
.
<EOS>
if
they
subscribe
readily
the
first
time
,
I
renew
my
request
to
beg
a
dedication
fee
.
<EOS>
if
they
let
me
have
that
,
I
smite
them
once
more
for
engrave
their
coat
of
arm
at
the
top
.
<EOS>
thus
,
continue
he
,
I
live
by
vanity
,
and
laugh
at
it
.
<EOS>
but
between
ourselves
,
I
be
now
too
well
known
,
I
should
be
glad
to
borrow
your
face
a
bit
:
a
nobleman
of
distinction
have
just
return
from
Italy
;
my
face
be
familiar
to
his
porter
;
but
if
you
bring
this
copy
of
verse
,
my
life
for
it
you
succeed
,
and
we
divide
the
spoil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bless
us
,
George
,
"
cry
I
,
"
and
be
this
the
employment
of
poet
now
!
<EOS>
do
man
of
their
exalted
talent
thus
stoop
to
beggary
!
<EOS>
Can
they
so
far
disgrace
their
calling
,
as
to
make
a
vile
traffic
of
praise
for
bread
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
o
no
,
Sir
,
"
return
he
,
"
a
true
poet
can
never
be
so
base
;
for
wherever
there
be
genius
there
be
pride
.
<EOS>
the
creature
I
now
describe
be
only
beggar
in
rhyme
.
<EOS>
the
real
poet
,
as
he
brave
every
hardship
for
fame
,
so
he
be
equally
a
coward
to
contempt
,
and
none
but
those
who
be
unworthy
protection
condescend
to
solicit
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
a
mind
too
proud
to
stoop
to
such
indignity
,
and
yet
a
fortune
too
humble
to
hazard
a
second
attempt
for
fame
,
I
be
now
,
oblige
to
take
a
middle
course
,
and
write
for
bread
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
unqualified
for
a
profession
where
mere
industry
alone
be
to
ensure
success
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
suppress
my
lurk
passion
for
applause
;
but
usually
consume
that
time
in
effort
after
excellence
which
take
up
but
<EOS>
little
room
,
when
it
should
have
be
more
advantageously
employ
in
the
diffusive
production
of
fruitful
mediocrity
.
<EOS>
My
little
piece
would
therefore
come
forth
in
the
mist
of
periodical
publication
,
unnoticed
and
unknown
.
<EOS>
the
public
be
more
importantly
employ
,
than
to
observe
the
easy
simplicity
of
my
style
,
of
the
harmony
of
my
period
.
<EOS>
sheet
after
sheet
be
throw
off
to
oblivion

<EOS>
My
essay
be
bury
among
the
essay
upon
liberty
,
eastern
tale
,
and
cure
for
the
bite
of
a
mad
dog
;
while
Philautos
,
Philalethes
,
Philelutheros
,
and
Philanthropos
,
all
write
better
,
because
they
write
faster
,
than
I.
  
"
now
,
therefore
,
I
begin
to
associate
with
none
but
disappointed
author
,
like
myself
,
who
praise
,
deplore
,
and
despise
each
other

<EOS>
the
satisfaction
we
find
in
every
celebrated
writer
's
attempt
,
be
inversely
as
their
merit
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
no
genius
in
another
could
please
me
.
<EOS>
My
unfortunate
paradox
have
entirely
dry
up
that
source
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
could
neither
read
nor
write
with
satisfaction
;
for
excellence
in

my
aversion

writing
be
my
trade

in
the

of
these
gloomy
reflection

as
I
be
one
day
sit
on

each

hesitation

almost
ashamed

one
who
make
so
shabby
an
appearance

I
afraid

repulse

to
alter
my
appearance
by
a

fine
suit

cloath

I

admit
to
his
table

footing

half-
underling

My
business
be
to
attend
him
at
auction

to
put
him
in
spirit
when
he
sate
for
his
picture

to
take
the

chariot
when
not
fill

to

tattere
a

as
the
phrase
be

a
mind
for
a
frolic

<EOS>
beside
this
,
I
have
twenty
other
little
employment
in
the
family

<EOS>
I
be
to
do
many
small
thing
without
bid
;
to
carry
the
cork
screw
;
to
stand
godfather
to
all
the
butler

child
;
to
sing
when
I
be
bid

to
be
never
out
of
humour

always
to
be
humble

,
if
I
could
,
to
be
very
happy

<EOS>
"
in
this
honourable
post
,
however
,
I
be
not
without
a
rival

<EOS>
a
captain
of
marines
,
who
be
form
for
the
place
by
nature
,
oppose
me
in
my
patron
's
affection
.
<EOS>
His
mother
have
be
laundress
to
a
man
of
quality
,
and
thus
he
early
acquire
a
taste
for
pimping
and
pedigree
.
<EOS>
as
this
gentleman
make
it
the
study
of
his
life
to
be
acquaint
with
lord
,
though
he
be
dismiss
from
several
for
his
stupidity
;
yet
he
find
many
of
them
who
be
as
dull
as
himself
,
that
permit
his
assiduity
.
<EOS>
as
flattery
be
his
trade
,
he
practise
it
with
the
easy
address
imaginable
;
but
it
come
aukward
and
stiff
from
me
;
and
as
every
day
my
patron
's
desire
of
flattery
encrease
,
so
every
hour
be
better
acquaint
with
his
defect
,
I
become
more
unwilling
to
give
it
.
<EOS>
thus
I
be
once
more
fairly
go
to
give
up
the
field
to
the
captain
,
when
my
friend
find
occasion
for
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
this
be
nothing
less
than
to
fight
a
duel
for
him
,
with
a
gentleman
whose
sister
it
be
pretend
he
have
use
ill
.
<EOS>
I
readily
comply
with
his
request
,
and
tho
"
<EOS>
I
see
you
be
displeased
at
my
conduct
,
yet
as
it
be
a
debt
indispensably
due
to
friendship
,
I
could
not
refuse
.
<EOS>
I
undertake
the
affair
,
disarm
my
antagonist
,
and
soon
after
have
the
pleasure
of
find
that
the
lady
be
only
a
woman
of
the
town
,
and
the
fellow
her
bully
and
a
sharp
.
<EOS>
this
piece
of
service
be
repay
with
the
warm
profession
of
gratitude
;
but
as
my
friend
be
to
leave
town
in
a
few
day
,
he
know
no
other
method
of
serve
me
,
but
by
recommend
me
to
his
uncle
Sir
William
Thornhill
,
and
another
nobleman
of
great
distinction
,
who
enjoy
a
post
under
the
government
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
my
first
care
be
to
carry
his
recommendatory
letter
to
his
uncle
,
a
man
whose
character
for
every
virtue
be
universal
,
yet
just
.
<EOS>
I
be
receive
by
his
servant
with
the
most
hospitable
smile
;
for
the
look
of
the
domestic
ever
transmit
their
master
's
benevolence
.
<EOS>
be
shew
into
a
grand
apartment
,
where
Sir
William
soon
come
to
me
,
I
deliver
my
message
and
letter
,
which
he
read
,
and
after
pause
some
minute
,
Pray
,
Sir
,
cry
he
,
inform
me
what
you
have
do
for
my
kinsman
,
to
deserve
this
warm
recommendation
?
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
I
guess
your
merit
,
you
have
fight
for
him
;
and
so
you
would
expect
a
reward
from
me
,
for
be
the
instrument
of
his
vice
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
sincerely
wish
,
that
my
present
refusal
may
be
some
punishment
for
your
guilt
;
but
still
more
,
that
it
may
be
some
inducement
to
your
repentance
.
  
<EOS>
the
severity
of
this
rebuke
I
bear
patiently
,
because
I
know
it
be
just
.
<EOS>
My
whole
expectation
now
,
therefore
,
lie
in
my
letter
to
the
great
man
.
<EOS>
as
the
door
of
the
nobility
be
almost
ever
beset
with
beggar
,
all
ready
to
thrust
in
some
sly
petition
,
I
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
gain
admittance
.
<EOS>
however
,
after
bribe
the
servant
with
half
my
worldly
fortune
,
I
be
at
last
shew
into
a
spacious
apartment
,
my
letter
be
previously
send
up
for
his
lordship
's
inspection
.
<EOS>
during
this
anxious
interval
I
have
full
time
to
look
round
me
.
<EOS>
every
thing
be
grand
,
and
of
happy
contrivance
:
the
painting
,
the
furniture
,
the
gilding
,
petrify
me
with
awe
,
and
raise
my
idea
of
the
owner
.
<EOS>
ah
,
think
I
to
myself
,
how
very
great
must
the
possessor
of
all
these
thing
be
,
who
carry
in
his
head
the
business
of
the
state
,
and
whose
house
display
half
the
wealth
of
a
kingdom
:
sure
his
genius
must
be
unfathomable
!
<EOS>
during
these
awful
reflection
I
hear
a
step
come
heavily
forward
.
<EOS>
ah
,
this
be
the
great
man
himself
!
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
only
a
chambermaid
.
<EOS>
another
foot
be
hear
soon
after
.
<EOS>
this
must
be
He
!
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
only
the
great
man
's
valet
de
chambre
.
<EOS>
at
last
his
lordship
actually
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
be
you
,
cry
he
,
the
bearer
of
this
here
letter
?
<EOS>
I
answer
with
a
bow
.
<EOS>
I
learn
by
this
,
continue
he
,
as
how
that
  
<EOS>
but
just
at
that
instant
a
servant
deliver
him
a
card
,
and
without
take
farth
notice
,
he
go
out
of
the
room
,
and
leave
me
to
digest
my
own
happiness
at
leisure
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
more
of
him
,
till
tell
by
a
footman
that
his
lordship
be
go
to
his
coach
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
down
I
immediately
follow
,
and
join
my
voice
to
that
of
three
or
four
more
,
who
come
,
like
me
,
to
petition
for
favour
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
however
,
go
too
fast
for
us
,
and
be
gain
his
Chariot
door
with
large
stride
,
when
I
hallow
out
to
know
if
I
be
to
have
any
reply
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
this
time
get
in
,
and
mutter
an
answer
,
half
of
which
only
I
hear
,
the
other
half
be
lose
in
the
rattling
of
his
chariot
wheel
.
<EOS>
I
stand
for
some
time
with
my
neck
stretch
out
,
in
the
posture
of
one
that
be
listen
to
catch
the
glorious
sound
,
till
look
round
me
,
I
find
myself
alone
at
his
lordship
's
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
patience
,
"
continue
my
son
,
"
be
now
quite
exhausted
:
sting
with
the
thousand
indignity
I
have
meet
with
<EOS>
,
I
be
willing
to
cast
myself
away
,
and
only
want
the
gulph
to
receive
me
.
<EOS>
I
regard
myself
as
one
of
those
vile
thing
that
nature
design
should
be
throw
by
into
her
lumber
room
,
there
to
perish
in
obscurity
.
<EOS>
I
have
still
,
however
,
half
a
guinea
leave
,
and
of
that
I
think
fortune
herself
should
not
deprive
me
:
<EOS>
but
in
order
to
be
sure
of
this
,
I
be
resolve
to
go
instanily
and
spend
it
while
I
have
it
,
and
then
trust
to
occurrence
for
the
rest
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
go
along
with
this
resolution
,
it
happen
that
Mr
Cripse
's
office
seem
invitingly
open
to
give
me
a
welcome
reception
.
<EOS>
in
this
office
Mr
Cripse
kindly
offer
all
his
majesty
's
subject
a
generous
promise
of
30
pound
a
year
,
for
which
promise
all
they
give
in
return
be
their
liberty
for
life
,
and
permission
to
let
him
transport
them
to
America
as
slave
.
<EOS>
I
be
happy
at
find
a
place
where
I
could
lose
my
fear
in
desperation
,
and
enter
this
cell
,
for
it
have
the
appearance
of
one
,
with
the
devotion
of
a
monastic
.
<EOS>
here
I
find
a
number
of
poor
creature
,
all
in
circumstance
like
myself
,
expect
the
arrival
of
Mr
Cripse
,
present
a
true
epitome
of
english
impatience
.
<EOS>
each
untractable
soul
at
variance
with
fortune
,
wreak
her
injury
on
their
own
heart
:
but
Mr
Cripse
at
last
come
down
,
and
all
our
murmur
be
hush
.
<EOS>
He
deign
to
regard
me
with
an
air
of
peculiar
approbation
,
and
indeed
he
be
the
first
man
who
for
a
month
past
talk
to
me
with
smile
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
question
,
he
find
I
be
fit
for
every
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
pause
a
while
upon
the
proper
mean
of
provide
for
me
,
and
slap
his
forehead
,
as
if
he
have
find
it
,
assure
me
,
that
there
be
at
that
time
an
embassy
talk
of
from
the
synod
of
Pensylvania
to
the
Chickasaw
Indians
,
and
that
he
would
use
his
interest
to
get
me
make
secretary
.
<EOS>
I
know
in
my
own
heart
that
the
fellow
lie
,
and
yet
his
promise
give
me
pleasure
<EOS>
,
there
be
something
so
magnificent
in
the
sound
.
<EOS>
I
fairly
,
therefore
,
divide
my
half
guinea
,
one
half
of
which
go
to
be
add
to
his
thirty
thousand
pound
,
and
with
the
other
half
I
resolve
to
go
to
the
next
tavern
,
to
be
there
more
happy
than
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
I
be
go
out
with
that
resolution
,
I
be
meet
at
the
door
by
the
captain
of
a
ship
,
with
whom
I
have
formerly
some
little
acquaintance
,
and
he
agree
to
be
my
companion
over
a
bowl
of
punch
.
<EOS>
as
I
never
choose
to
make
a
secret
of
my
circumstance
,
he
assure
me
that
I
be
upon
the
very
point
of
ruin
,
in
listen
to
the
office
-
keeper
's
promise
;
for
that
he
only
design
to
sell
me
to
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
but
,
continue
he
,
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
you
may
,
by
a
much
short
voyage
,
be
very
easily
put
into
a
genteel
way
of
bread
.
<EOS>
take
my
advice
.
<EOS>
My
ship
sail
to
-
morrow
for
Amsterdam
;
what
if
you
go
in
her
as
a
passenger
?
<EOS>
the
moment
you
land
all
you
have
to
do
be
to
teach
the
Dutchmen
English
,
and
I
will
warrant
you
will
get
pupil
and
money
enough
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
understand
English
,
add
he
,
by
this
time
,
or
the
deuce
be
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
confidently
assure
him
of
that
;
but
express
a
doubt
whether
the
Dutch
would
be
willing
to
learn
English
.
<EOS>
He
affirm
with
an
oath
that
they
be
fond
of
it
to
distraction
;
and
upon
that
affirmation
I
agree
with
his
proposal
,
and
embark
the
next
day
to
teach
the
Dutch
English
in
Holland
.
<EOS>
the
wind
be
fair
,
our
voyage
short
,
and
after
have
pay
my
passage
,
with
half
my
moveable
,
I
find
myself
,
fall
as
from
the
sky
,
a
stranger
in
one
of
the
principal
street
of
Amsterdam
.
<EOS>
in
this
situation
I
be
unwilling
to
let
any
time
pass
unemployed
in
teaching
.
<EOS>
I
address
myself
therefore
to
two
or
three
of
those
I
meet
whose
appearance
seem
most
promising
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
make
ourselves
mutually
understand
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
this
very
moment
I
recollect
,
that
in
order
to
teach
Dutchmen
English
,
it
be
necessary
that
they
should
first
teach
me
Dutch
.
<EOS>
how
I
come
to
overlook
so
obvious
an
objection
,
be
to
me
amazing
;
but
certain
it
be
I
overlook
it
  
<EOS>
"
this
scheme
thus
blow
up
,
I
have
some
thought
of
fairly
ship
back
to
England
again
;
but
happen
into
company
with
an
irish
student
,
who
be
return
from
Louvain
,
our
conversation
turn
upon
topic
of
literature
,
(
for
by
the
way
it
may
be
observe
that
I
always
forget
the
meanness
of
my
circumstance
when
I
could
converse
upon
such
subject
)
<EOS>
from
him
I
learn
that
there
be
not
two
man
in
his
whole
university
who
understand
Greek
.
<EOS>
this
amaze
me
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
resolve
to
travel
to
Louvain
,
and
there
live
by
teach
Greek
;
and
in
this
design
I
be
hearten
by
my
brother
student
,
who
throw
out
some
hint
that
a
fortune
may
be
get
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
set
boldly
forward
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
every
day
lessen
the
burthen
of
my
moveable
,
like
Aesop
and
his
basket
of
bread
;
for
I
pay
them
for
my
lodging
to
the
Dutch
as
I
travel
on
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
Louvain
,
I
be
resolve
not
to
go
sneak
to
the
low
professor
,
but
openly
tender
my
talent
to
the
principal
himself
.
<EOS>
I
go
,
have
admittance
,
and
offer
him
my
service
as
a
master
of
the
greek
language
,
which
I
have
be
tell
be
a
desideratum
in
his
university
.
<EOS>
the
principal
seem
at
first
to
doubt
of
my
ability
;
but
of
these
I
offer
to
convince
him
,
by
turn
a
part
of
any
greek
author
he
should
fix
upon
into
Latin
.
<EOS>
find
me
perfectly
earnest
in
my
proposal
,
he
address
me
thus
:
You
see
me
,
young
man
,
continue
he
<EOS>
,
I
never
learn
Greek
,
and
I
do
not
find
that
I
have
ever
miss
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
doctor
's
cap
and
gown
without
Greek
:
<EOS>
I
have
ten
thousand
florin
a
year
without
Greek
;
I
eat
heartily
without
Greek
,
and
in
short
,
continue
he
,
as
I
do
not
know
Greek
,
I
do
not
believe
there
be
any
good
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
now
too
far
from
home
to
think
of
return
;
so
I
resolve
to
go
forward
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
knowledge
of
music
,
with
a
tolerable
voice
,
and
now
turn
what
be
once
my
amusement
into
a
present
mean
of
subsistence
.
<EOS>
I
pass
among
the
harmless
peasant
of
Flanders
,
and
among
such
of
the
French
as
be
poor
enough
to
be
very
merry
;
for
I
ever
find
them
sprightly
in
proportion
to
their
want
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
approach
a
peasant
's
house
towards
night-
fall
,
I
play
one
of
my
most
merry
tune
,
and
that
procure
me
not
only
a
lodging
,
but
subsistence
for
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
I
once
or
twice
attempt
to
play
for
people
of
fashion
;
but
they
always
think
my
performance
odious
,
and
never
reward
me
even
with
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
this
be
to
me
the
more
extraordinary
,
as
whenever
I
use
in
well
day
to
play
for
company
,
when
play
be
my
amusement
,
my
music
never
fail
to
throw
them
into
rapture
,
and
the
lady
especially
;
but
as
it
be
now
my
only
mean
,
it
be
receive
with
contempt
:
<EOS>
a
proof
how
ready
the
world
be
to
under
rate
those
talent
by
which
a
man
be
support
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
manner
I
proceed
to
Paris
,
with
no
design
but
just
to
look
about
me
,
and
then
to
go
forward
.
<EOS>
the
people
of
Paris
be
much
fonder
of
stranger
that
have
money
,
than
of
those
that
have
wit
.
<EOS>
as
I
could
not
boast
much
of
either
,
I
be
no
great
favourite
.
<EOS>
after
walk
about
the
town
four
or
five
day
,
and
see
the
outside
of
the
good
house
,
I
be
prepare
to
leave
this
retreat
of
venal
hospitality
,
when
pass
through
one
of
the
principal
street
,
whom
should
I
meet
but
our
cousin
,
to
whom
you
first
recommend
me
.
<EOS>
this
meeting
be
very
agreeable
to
me
,
and
I
believe
not
displease
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
enquire
into
the
nature
of
my
journey
to
Paris
,
and
inform
me
of
his
own
business
there
,
which
be
to
collect
picture
,
medal
,
intaglio
,
and
antique
of
all
kind
,
for
a
gentleman
in
London
,
who
have
just
stept
into
taste
and
a
large
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
more
surprised
at
see
our
cousin
pitch
upon
for
this
office
,
as
he
himself
have
often
assure
me
he
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
upon
my
ask
how
he
have
be
teach
the
art
of
a
connoscento
so
very
suddenly
,
he
assure
me
that
nothing
be
more
easy
.
<EOS>
the
whole
secret
consist
in
a
strict
adherence
to
two
rule
:
the
one
always
to
observe
,
that
the
picture
may
have
be
well
if
the
painter
have
take
more
pain
;
and
the
other
,
to
praise
the
work
of
Pietro
Perugino
.
<EOS>
but
,
say
he
,
as
I
once
teach
you
how
to
be
an
author
in
London
,
I
will
now
undertake
to
instruct
you
in
the
art
of
picture
buying
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
this
proposal
I
very
readily
closed
,
as
it
be
a
living
,
and
now
all
my
ambition
be
to
live
.
<EOS>
I
go
therefore
to
his
lodging
,
improve
my
dress
by
his
assistance
,
and
after
some
time
,
accompany
him
to
auction
of
picture
,
where
the
english
gentry
be
expect
to
be
purchaser
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
little
surprised
at
his
intimacy
with
people
of
the
good
fashion
,
who
refer
themselves
to
his
judgment
upon
every
picture
or
medal
,
as
to
an
unerring
standard
of
taste
.
<EOS>
He
make
very
good
use
of
my
assistance
upon
these
occasion
;
for
when
ask
his
opinion
,
he
would
gravely
take
me
aside
,
and
ask
mine
,
shrug
,
look
wise
,
return
,
and
assure
the
company
,
that
he
could
give
no
opinion
upon
an
affair
of
so
much
importance
.
<EOS>
yet
there
be
sometimes
an
occasion
for
a
more
supported
assurance
.
<EOS>
I
remember
to
have
see
him
,
after
give
his
opinion
that
the
colouring
of
a
picture
be
not
mellow
enough
,
very
deliberately
take
a
brush
with
brown
varnish
,
that
be
accidentally
lie
by
,
and
rub
it
over
the
piece
with
great
composure
before
all
the
company
,
and
then
ask
if
he
have
not
improve
the
tint
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
he
have
finish
his
commission
in
Paris
,
he
leave
me
strongly
recommend
to
several
man
of
distinction
,
as
a
person
very
proper
for
a
travel
tutor
;
and
after
some
time
I
be
employ
in
that
capacity
by
a
gentleman
who
bring
his
ward
to
Paris
,
in
order
to
set
him
forward
on
his
tour
through
Europe
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
be
the
young
gentleman
's
governor
,
but
with
a
proviso
that
he
should
always
be
permit
to
govern
himself
.
<EOS>
My
pupil
in
fact
understand
the
art
of
guide
in
<EOS>
money
concern
much
well
than
<EOS>
I.
He
be
heir
to
a
fortune
of
about
two
hundred
thousand
pound
,
leave
him
by
an
uncle
in
the
West
Indies
;
and
his
guardian
,
to
qualify
him
for
the
management
of
it
,
have
bind
him
apprentice
to
an
attorney
.
<EOS>
thus
avarice
be
his
prevail
passion
:
all
his
question
on
the
road
be
how
money
may
be
save
,
which
be
the
least
expensive
course
of
travel
;
whether
any
thing
could
be
buy
that
would
turn
to
account
when
dispose
of
again
in
London
.
<EOS>
such
curiosity
on
the
way
as
could
be
see
for
nothing
he
be
ready
enough
to
look
at
;
but
if
the
sight
of
them
be
to
be
pay
for
,
he
usually
assert
that
he
have
be
tell
they
be
not
worth
see
.
<EOS>
He
never
pay
a
bill
,
that
he
would
not
observe
,
how
amazingly
expensive
travelling
be
,
and
all
this
though
he
be
not
yet
twenty
-
one
.
<EOS>
when
arrive
at
Leghorn
,
as
we
take
a
walk
to
look
at
the
port
and
shipping
,
he
enquire
the
expence
of
the
passage
by
sea
home
to
England
.
<EOS>
this
he
be
inform
be
but
a
trifle
,
compare
to
his
return
by
land
,
he
be
therefore
unable
to
withstand
the
temptation
;
so
pay
me
the
small
part
of
my
salary
that
be
due
,
he
take
leave
,
and
embark
with
only
one
attendant
for
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
therefore
be
leave
once
more
upon
the
world
at
large
,
but
then
it
be
a
thing
I
be
use
to
.
<EOS>
however
my
skill
in
music
could
avail
me
nothing
in
a
country
where
every
peasant
be
a
well
musician
than
I
;
but
by
this
time
I
have
acquire
another
talent
,
which
answer
my
purpose
as
well
,
and
this
be
a
skill
in
disputation
.
<EOS>
in
all
the
foreign
university
and
convent
,
there
be
upon
certain
day
philosophical
thesis
maintain
against
every
adventitious
disputant
;
for
which
,
if
the
champion
oppose
with
any
dexterity
,
he
can
claim
a
gratuity
in
money
,
a
dinner
,
and
a
bed
,
for
one
night
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
therefore
I
fight
my
way
towards
England
,
walk
along
from
city
to
city
,
examine
mankind
more
nearly
,
and
,
if
I
may
so
express
it
,
see
both
side
of
the
picture
.
<EOS>
My
remark
,
however
,
be
but
few
:
<EOS>
I
find
that
monarchy
be
the
good
government
for
the
poor
to
live
in
,
and
commonwealth
for
the
rich
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
rich
in
general
be
in
every
country
another
name
for
freedom
;
and
that
no
man
be
so
fond
of
liberty
himself
as
not
to
be
desirous
of
subject
the
will
of
some
individual
in
society
to
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
arrival
in
England
,
I
resolve
to
pay
my
respect
first
to
you
,
and
then
to
enlist
as
a
volunteer
in
the
first
expedition
that
be
go
forward
;
but
on
my
journey
down
my
resolution
be
change
,
by
meet
an
old
acquaintance
,
who
I
find
belong
to
a
company
of
comedian
,
that
be
go
to
make
a
summer
campaign
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
the
company
seem
not
much
to
disapprove
of
me
for
an
associate
.
<EOS>
They
all
,
however
,
apprize
me
of
the
importance
of
the
task
at
which
I
aim
;
that
the
public
be
a
many
head
monster
,
and
that
only
such
as
have
very
good
head
could
please
it
:
that
acting
be
not
to
be
learn
in
a
day
;
and
that
without
some
traditional
shrug
,
which
have
be
on
the
stage
,
and
only
on
the
stage
,
these
hundred
year
,
I
could
never
pretend
to
please
.
<EOS>
the
next
difficulty
be
in
fit
me
with
part
,
as
almost
every
character
be
in
keeping
.
<EOS>
I
be
drive
for
some
time
from
one
character
to
another
,
till
at
last
Horatio
be
fix
upon
,
which
the
presence
of
the
present
company
have
happily
hinder
me
from
act
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
the
short
continuance
of
friendship
amongst
the
vicious
,
which
be
coeval
only
with
mutual
satisfaction
  
<EOS>
My
son
's
account
be
too
long
to
be
deliver
at
once
,
the
first
part
of
it
be
begin
that
night
,
and
he
be
conclude
the
rest
after
dinner
the
next
day
,
when
the
appearance
of
Mr
Thornhill
's
equipage
at
the
door
seem
to
make
a
pause
in
the
general
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
the
butler
,
who
be
now
become
my
friend
in
the
family
,
inform
me
with
a
whisper
,
that
the
"
Squire
have
already
make
some
overture
to
Miss
Wilmot
,
and
that
her
aunt
and
uncle
seem
highly
to
approve
the
match
.
<EOS>
upon
Mr
Thornhill
's
entering
,
he
seem
,
at
see
my
son
and
me
,
to
start
back
;
but
I
readily
impute
that
to
surprize
,
and
not
displeasure
.
<EOS>
however
,
upon
our
advance
to
salute
him
,
he
return
our
greeting
with
the
most
apparent
candour
;
and
after
a
short
time
,
his
presence
serve
only
to
encrease
the
general
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
after
tea
he
call
me
aside
,
to
enquire
after
my
daughter
;
but
upon
my
inform
him
that
my
enquiry
be
unsuccessful
,
he
seem
greatly
surprised
;
add
,
that
he
have
be
since
frequently
at
my
house
,
in
order
to
comfort
the
rest
of
my
family
,
whom
he
leave
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
if
I
have
communicate
her
misfortune
to
Miss
Wilmot
,
or
my
son
;
and
upon
my
replying
that
I
have
not
tell
them
as
yet
,
he
greatly
approve
my
prudence
and
precaution
,
desire
me
by
all
mean
to
keep
it
a
secret
:
"
<EOS>
for
at
good
,
"
cry
he
,
"
it
be
but
divulge
one
's
own
infamy
;
and
perhaps
Miss
Livy
may
not
be
so
guilty
as
we
all
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
here
interrupt
by
a
servant
,
who
come
to
ask
the
"
Squire
in
,
to
stand
up
at
country
dance
;
so
that
he
leave
me
quite
pleased
with
the
interest
he
seem
to
take
in
my
concern
.
<EOS>
His
address
,
however
,
to
Miss
Wilmot
,
be
too
obvious
to
be
mistake
;
and
yet
she
seem
not
perfectly
pleased
,
but
bore
them
rather
in
compliance
to
the
will
of
her
aunt
,
than
from
real
inclination
.
<EOS>
I
have
even
the
satisfaction
to
see
her
lavish
<EOS>
some
kind
look
upon
my
unfortunate
son
,
which
the
other
could
neither
extort
by
his
fortune
nor
assiduity
.
<EOS>
Mr
Thornhill
's
seeming
composure
,
however
,
not
a
little
surprised
me
<EOS>
:
we
have
now
continue
here
a
week
,
at
the
press
instance
of
Mr
Arnold
;
but
each
day
the
more
tenderness
Miss
Wilmot
shew
my
son
,
Mr
Thomhill
's
friendship
seem
proportionably
to
encrease
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
formerly
make
us
the
most
kind
assurance
of
use
his
interest
to
serve
the
family
;
but
now
his
generosity
be
not
confine
to
promise
alone
<EOS>
:
the
morning
I
design
for
my
departure
,
Mr
Thornhill
come
to
me
with
look
of
real
pleasure
to
inform
me
of
a
piece
of
service
he
have
do
for
his
friend
George
.
<EOS>
this
be
nothing
less
than
his
have
procure
him
an
ensign
's
commission
in
one
of
the
regiment
that
be
go
to
the
West
Indies
,
for
which
he
have
promise
but
one
hundred
pound
,
his
interest
have
be
sufficient
to
get
an
abatement
of
the
other
two
.
"
<EOS>
as
for
this
trifle
piece
of
service
,
"
continue
the
young
gentleman
,
"
I
desire
no
other
reward
but
the
pleasure
of
have
serve
my
friend
;
and
as
for
the
hundred
pound
to
be
pay
,
if
you
be
unable
to
raise
it
yourself
,
I
will
advance
it
,
and
you
shall
repay
me
at
your
leisure
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
favour
we
want
word
to
express
our
sense
of
.
<EOS>
I
readily
therefore
give
my
bond
for
the
money
,
and
testify
as
much
gratitude
as
if
I
never
intend
to
pay
.
  
<EOS>
George
be
to
depart
for
town
the
next
day
to
secure
his
commission
,
in
pursuance
of
his
generous
patron
's
direction
,
who
judge
it
highly
expedient
to
use
dispatch
,
lest
in
the
mean
time
another
should
step
in
with
more
advantageous
proposal
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
therefore
,
our
young
soldier
be
early
prepare
for
his
departure
,
and
seem
the
only
person
among
us
that
be
not
affect
by
it

<EOS>
neither

fatigue
and
danger
he
be
go
to
encounter

nor
the
friend

mistress

Miss
Wilmot
actually

way
damp
his
spirit

<EOS>
after
he
have
take
leave
of
the
rest
of

company

I
give
him
all
I
have

my
blessing

go
,
my
boy

and
immitate
him
in
all

his
misfortune
,
if
it
be
a
misfortune
to
die
with
Lord

go
,
my
boy

if
you
fall

exposed
and
unwept
by
those

"
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
take
leave
of
the
good
family
<EOS>
,
that
have
be
kind
enough
to
entertain
me
so
long
,
not
without
several
expression
of
gratitude
to
Mr
Thornhill
for
his
late
bounty
.
<EOS>
I
leave
them
in
the
enjoyment
of
all
that
happiness
which
affluence
and
good
breeding
procure
,
and
return
towards
home
,
despairing
of
ever
find
my
daughter
more
,
but
send
a
sigh
to
heaven
to
spare
and
to
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
come
within
about
twenty
mile
of
home
,
have
hire
an
horse
to
carry
me
,
as
I
be
yet
but
weak
,
and
comfort
myself
with
the
hope
of
soon
see
all
I
hold
dear
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
but
the
night
come
on
,
I
put
up
at
a
little
public
-
house
by
the
roadside
,
and
ask
for
the
landlord
's
company
over
a
pint
of
wine
.
<EOS>
We
sate
beside
his
kitchen
fire
,
which
be
the
good
room
in
the
house
,
and
chat
on
politic
and
the
news
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
We
happen
,
among
other
topic
,
to
talk
of
young
"
Squire
Thornhill
,
who
the
host
assure
me
be
hate
as
much
as
his
uncle
Sir
William
,
who
sometimes
come
down
to
the
country
,
be
love
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
to
observe
,
that
he
make
it
his
whole
study
to
betray
the
daughter
of
such
as
receive
him
to
their
house
,
and
after
a
fortnight
or
three
week
possession
,
turn
them
out
unrewarde
and
abandon
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
as
we
continue
our
discourse
in
this
manner
,
his
wife
,
who
have
be
out
to
get
change
,
return
,
and
perceive
that
her
husband
be
enjoy
a
pleasure
in
which
she
be
not
a
sharer
,
she
ask
him
,
in
an
angry
tone
,
what
he
do
there
,
to
which
he
only
reply
in
an
ironical
way
,
by
drink
her
health

Mr
Symmonds

"
cry
she
,
"
you
use
me
very
ill

I
will
bear
it
no

<EOS>
here
three
part
of
the
business
be
leave
for

to
do

the
fourth
left
unfinished

you
do
nothing

soak
with

if
a
spoonful

liquor

I
never

a
drop

I
now
find
what
she
would
be
at
,
and
immediately
pour
her
out
a
glass
,
which
she
receive
with
a
curtesy
,
and
drink
towards
my
good
health

Sir
,
"
resume
she
,
"
it
be
not
so
much
for
the
value
of
the
liquor
I
be
angry

one
can
not

it

when
the
house

go
out

the
customer

all
the
burthen

as
lief
eat
that
glass
as
budge
after
them
himself

"
there
now
above
stair

we
have
a
young
woman
who

civility

<EOS>
I
be
certain

<EOS>
"
I

reply
the
wife
;

but
I
know
that
I
be
sure
she

be
here
a
fortnight
,

not
yet

the
cross
of
her
money

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I

my

he

have
it
all
in

get
it
any

very
night

out

out

shall
pack
with
a

may
be
good

where

for
my

I
never

much
good
of
them
at
the
sign
of
the
Harrow
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
say
,
she
run
up
a
narrow
flight
of
stair
,
that
go
from
the
kitchen
to
a
room
over
-
head
,
and
I
soon
perceive
by
the
loudness
of
her
voice
,
and
the
bitterness
of
her
reproach
,
that
no
money
be
to
be
have
from
her
lodger
.
<EOS>
I
could
hear
her
remonstrance
very
distinctly
:
"
out
I
say
,
pack
out
this
moment
,
tramp
thou
infamous
strumpet

I
will
give
thee

a
mark

<EOS>

I
instantly
know
the
voice
of
my
poor

Olivia

I
fly
to
her

while
the

you

so
much
uneasiness

sure

much

I

pardon

I

go
to

a
slow
defence

at

a
sure
one

<EOS>
the

now
return
to
know
if

a
more
genteel
apartment

to
which
assent

a

more
freely

<EOS>
after
we
have
talk
ourselves
into
some
degree

tranquillity

I
could
not
avoid
desire
some
account

honourable

"
Villain
indeed

I
;

and
yet
it
in
some
measure
surprize
me
,
how
a
person
of
Mr
Burchell

good
sense

seem
honour
could
be
guilty
of
such
deliberate
baseness
,

thus
step
into
a

undo
it
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
papa

"
return
my
daughter
,
"
you
labour
under
a
strange
mistake
,
Mr
Burchell
never
attempt
to
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
instead
of
that
he
take
every
opportunity
of
privately
admonish
me
against
the
artifice
of
Mr
Thornhill
,
who
I
now
find
be
even
bad
than
he
represent
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Thornhill
,
"
interrupt
I
,
"
can
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Sir
,
"
return
she
,
"
it
be
Mr
Thornhill
who
seduce
me
,
who
employ
the
two
lady
,
as
he
call
them
,
but
who
,
in
fact
,
be
abandon
woman
of
the
town
,
without
breeding
or
pity
,
to
decoy
us
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
Their
artifice
,
you
may
remember
would
have
certainly
succeed
,
but
for
Mr
Burchell
's
letter
,
who
direct
those
reproach
at
them
,
which
we
all
apply
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
how
he
come
to
have
so
much
influence
as
to
defeat
their
intention
,
still
remain
a
secret
to
me
;

I
be
convinced
he
be
ever
our
warm
sincere
friend

<EOS>
"
You
amaze
me
,
my

cry
I
;
"
<EOS>
but
now
I
find
my
first
suspicion
of
Mr
Thornhill
's
baseness
be
too
well
ground
:
but
he
can
triumph
in
security
;
<EOS>
for
he
be
rich
and
we
be
poor
.
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
my
child
,
sure
it
be
no
small
temptation
that
could
thus
obliterate
all
the
impression
of
such
an
education
,

so
virtuous
a
disposition
as
thine

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Sir

"
reply
she
,
"
he
owe
all
his
triumph
to
the
desire
I
have
of
make
him

myself

happy

<EOS>
I
know
that
the
ceremony
of
our
marriage

be
privately

by
a
popish

no
way
binding

that
I

nothing

his
honour

what

interrupt
I

be
you
indeed

by

in
order

<EOS>
"
indeed

we

why
then

<EOS>
"
alas

Papa

she
,
"
you
be

little
acquainted

he

six

so
?

then
we
must
hang
the
priest

you
shall

against
him
to

morrow

but
Sir

will
that
be
right

when
I

to
secrecy

"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
I
reply
,
"
if
you
have
make
such
a
promise
,
I
can
not
,
nor
will
I
tempt
you
to
break
it
.
<EOS>
even
tho
"
it
may
benefit
the
public
,
you
must
not
inform
against
him
.
<EOS>
in
all
human
institution
a
small
evil
be
allow
to
procure
a
great
good
;
as
in
politic
,
a
province
may
be
give
away
to
secure
a
kingdom
;
in
medicine
,
a
limb
may
be
lopt
off
,
to
preserve
the
body
.
<EOS>
but
in
religion
the
law
be
write
,
and
inflexible
,
never
to
do
evil
.
<EOS>
and
this
law
,
my
child
,
be
right
:
for
otherwise
,
if
we
commit
a
small
evil
,
to
procure
a
great
good
,
certain
guilt
would
be
thus
incur
,
in
expectation
of
contingent
advantage
.
<EOS>
and
though
the
advantage
should
certainly
follow
,
yet
the
interval
between
commission
and
advantage
,
which
be
allow
to
be
guilty
,
may
be
that
in
which
we
be
call
away
to
answer
for
the
thing
we
have
do
,
and
the
volume
of
human
action
be
close
for
ever
.
<EOS>
but
I
interrupt
you
,
my
dear
,
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
very
next
morning
,
"
continue
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
find
what
little
expectation
I
be
to
have
from
his
sincerity
.
<EOS>
that
very
morning
he
introduce
me
to
two
unhappy
woman
more
,
whom
,
like
me
,
he
have
deceive
,
but
who
live
in
contented
prostitution
.
<EOS>
I
love
him
too
tenderly
to
bear
such
rival
in
his
affection
,
and
strove
to
forget
my
infamy
in
a
tumult
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
I
dance
,
dress
,
and
talk
;
but
still
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
visit
there
tell
me
every
moment
of
the
power
of
my
charm
,
and
this
only
contribute
to
encrease
my
melancholy
,
as
I
have
throw
all
their
power
quite
away
.
<EOS>
thus
each
day
I
grow
more
pensive
,
and
he
more
insolent
,
till
at
last
the
monster
have
the
assurance
to
offer
me
to
a
young
Baronet
of
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
need
I
describe
,
Sir
,
how
his
ingratitude
sting
me
.
<EOS>
My
answer
to
this
proposal
be
almost
madness
.
<EOS>
I
desire
to
part
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
go
he
offer
me
a
purse
;
but
I
fling
it
at
him
with
indignation
,
and
burst
from
him
in
a
rage
,
that
for
a
while
keep
me
insensible
of
the
misery
of
my
situation
.
<EOS>
but
I
soon
look
round
me
,
and
see
myself
a
vile
,
abject
,
guilty
thing
,
without
one
friend
in
the
world
to
apply
to
.
<EOS>
just
in
that
interval
,
a
stage-
coach
happen
to
pass
by
,
I
take
a
place
<EOS>
,
it
be
my
only
aim
to
be
drive
at
a
distance
from
a
wretch
I
despise
and
detest
.
<EOS>
I
be
set
down
here
,
where
,
since
my
arrival
,
my
own
anxiety
,
and
this
woman
's
unkindness
,
have
be
my
only
companion
.
<EOS>
the
hour
of
pleasure
that
I
have
pass
with
my
mamma
and
sister
,
now
grow
painful
to
me
.
<EOS>
Their
sorrow
be
much
;
but
mine
be
great
than
theirs
;
for
mine
be
mix
with
guilt
and
infamy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
patience
,
my
child
,
"
cry
I
,
"
and
I
hope
thing
will
yet
be
well
.
<EOS>
take
some
repose
to
-
night
,
and
to
-
morrow
I
will
carry
you
home
to
your
mother
and
the
rest
of
the
family
,
from
whom
you
will
receive
a
kind
reception
.
<EOS>
poor
woman
,
this
have
go
to
her
heart
:
but
she
love
you
still
,
Olivia
,
and
will
forget
it
.
     
<EOS>
offence
be
easily
pardon
where
there
be
love
at
bottom
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
take
my
daughter
behind
me
,
and
set
out
on
my
return
home
.
<EOS>
as
we
travel
along
,
I
strove
,
by
every
persuasion
,
to
calm
her
sorrow
and
fear
,
and
to
arm
her
with
resolution
to
bear
the
presence
of
her
offend
mother
.
<EOS>
I
take
every
opportunity
,
from
the
prospect
of
a
fine
country
,
through
which
we
pass
,
to
observe
how
much
kind
heaven
be
to
us
,
than
we
to
each
other
,
and
that
the
misfortune
of
nature
's
making
be
very
few
.
<EOS>
I
assure
her
,
that
she
should
never
perceive
any
change
in
my
affection
,
and
that
during
my
life
,
which
yet
may
be
long
,
she
may
depend
upon
a
guardian
and
an
instructor
.
<EOS>
I
arm
her
against
the
censure
of
the
world
,
shew
her
that
book
be
sweet
unreproaching
companion
to
the
miserable
,
and
that
if
they
could
not
bring
us
to
enjoy
life
,
they
would
at
least
teach
us
to
endure
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
hired
horse
that
we
ride
be
to
be
put
up
that
night
at
an
inn
by
the
way
,
within
about
five
mile
from
my
house
,
and
as
I
be
willing
to
prepare
my
family
for
my
daughter
's
reception
,
I
determine
to
leave
her
that
night
at
the
inn
,
and
to
return
for
her
,
accompany
by
my
daughter
Sophia
,
early
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
night
before
we
reach
our
appoint
stage
:
however
,
after
see
her
provide
with
a
decent
apartment
,
and
have
order
the
hostess
to
prepare
proper
refreshment
,
I
kiss
her
,
and
proceed
towards
home
.
<EOS>
and
now
my
heart
catch
new
sensation
of
pleasure
the
nearer
I
approach
that
peaceful
mansion
.
<EOS>
as
a
bird
that
have
be
fright
from
its
nest
,
my
affection
out
-
go
my
haste
,
and
hover
round
my
little
fire
-
side
,
with
all
the
rapture
of
expectation
.
<EOS>
I
call
up
the
many
fond
thing
I
have
to
say
,
and
anticipate
the
welcome
I
be
to
receive
.
<EOS>
I
already
feel
my
wife
's
tender
embrace
,
and
sniile
at
the

mouthed

I
approach
my

It

near
mid

night
that
I

all
be
still

my

dilate
with
unutterable
happiness
,
when
,
to
my
amazement
,
I
see
the
house
burst
out
in
a
blaze
of
fire
,

every
apperture
red
with
conflagration

<EOS>
I
give
a

all
run
out

naked

wild
with
apprehension

recall
me
to

with
their
anguish

it
be
only

while
the

stand
,
with
silent
agony

look
on
,
as

they
enjoy
the
blaze

<EOS>
I
gaze
upon
them

upon
it
by
turn

then
look
round

We
kiss
our

a

they
clasp
us
round
the
neck

seem
to
share
our
transport

while
their

laugh

weep
by

<EOS>
I
now
stand
a
calm

and
after
some
time
,
begin
to
perceive
that
my

to
the
shoulder

scorch
in
a
terrible
manner

It

therefore
out

the

Squire

Sir

so
good

<EOS>
He
add

that
nothing

mirth

that
all

the

beauty

Mr

one
of
the
most
happy
man
in

"

return
I

"
but
,
my
son
,
observe
this
bed
of
straw
,
and
unsheltering
roof
;
those
mouldering
wall

humid
floor
;
my
wretched
body
thus
disable
by
fire

round
me
for

you
have
come
home

to
all
this

here

even
here

you
see
a

not

world
exchange
situation

<EOS>
o

my

if
you
could
but
learn
to
commune
with
your

know
what
noble
company
you
can
make
them

you
would
little

the
elegance

the
worthless

<EOS>
almost
all
man
have
be
teach
to
call
life
a
passage
,

themselves
the
traveller

<EOS>
the
similitude
still
may
be
improve
when
we
observe
that
the
good
be
joyful
and
serene
,
like
traveller
that
be
go
towards
home
;
the
wicked
but
by
interval
<EOS>
happy
,
like
traveller
that

into
exile

<EOS>
My
compassion
for
my
poor
daughter

overpower
by
this
new
disaster

interrupt
what
I
have
farth
to
observe
.
<EOS>
I
bid
her
mother
support
her
,
and
after
a
short
time
she
recover
.
<EOS>
She
appear
from
that
time
more
calm
,
and
I
imagine
have
gain
a
new
degree
of
resolution
;
but
appearance
deceive
me
;
for
her
tranquility
be
the
langour
of
over

work
resentment

<EOS>
a
supply
of
provision
,
charitably
send
us
by
my
kind
parishioner

seem
to
diffuse
new
cheerfulness
amongst
the
rest
of
the
family

nor
be
I
displeased
at
see
them
once
more
sprightly
and
at
ease
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
unjust
to
damp
their
satisfaction
,
merely
to
condole
with
resolute
melancholy
,
or
to
burthen
them
with
a
sadness
they
do
not

tale
go

fresh

<EOS>
the
next
morning

sun

with
peculiar
warmth
for
the
season

so
that
we
agree
to
breakfast
together
on
the
honeysuckle
bank
:
<EOS>
where
,
while
we
sate
,
my
young
daughter
,
at
my
request
,
join
her
voice
to
the
concert
on
the
tree
about
us

<EOS>
It
be
in
this
place
my
poor
Olivia
first
meet
her
seducer
,
and
every
object
serve
to
recall
her
sadness

<EOS>
but
that
melancholy

which
be
excite
by
object

pleasure

sound

sooth
the

the

her
guilt

her
shame
from
every

to
give
repentance

encrease
the

desirous

as
I
have
shew
you
what

it

which
,
as
I
have

not

easy

and
then
my
steward
talk

drive
for

it

know
his
duty

I
never
trouble
myself

yet
still
I
could
wish

even
to
have
you

your
daughter
present
at
my
marriage
,
which
be
shortly
to

Mr

"
hear
me
once
for
all
:
as
to
your
marriage
with
any
but
my
daughter

that
I
never

consent
to

and
though
your
friendship
could
raise
me
to
a
throne

your
resentment
sink
me
to

yet
would
I
despise
both

Thou
hast
once
wofully

irreparably

I
repose
my

have
give

health

<EOS>
go

and
leave
me
to
want

infamy

disease

sorrow

<EOS>
yet
humble
as
I
be

shall
my

still
vindicate
its
dignity

thou

upon
it
you
shall
feel
the
effect
of
this
insolence

we
shall
shortly
see
which
be
the
fit
object
of
scorn
,
you
or
me

<EOS>
upon
which
he
depart
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
My
wife
and
son
,
who
be
present
at
this
interview
,
seem
terrified
with
the
apprehension
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
also
,
find
that
he
be
go
,
come
out
to
be
inform
of
the
result
of
our
conference
,
which
,
when
know
,
alarm
them
not
less
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
myself
,
I
disregard
the
utmost
stretch
of
his
malevolence
:
he
have
already
strike
the
blow
,
and
now
I
stand
prepared
to
repel
every
new
effort
.
<EOS>
like
one
of
those
instrument
use
in
the
art
of
war
,
which
,
however
throw
,
still
present
a
point
to
receive
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
We
soon
,
however
,
find
that
he
have
not
threaten
in
vain
;
for
the
very
next
morning
his
steward
come
to
demand
my
annual
rent
,
which
,
by
the
train
of
accident
already
relate
,
I
be
unable
to
pay
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
my
incapacity
be
his
drive
my
cattle
that
evening
,
and
their
be
appraise
and
sell
the
next
day
for
less
than
half
their
value
.
<EOS>
My
wife
and
child
now
therefore
entreat
me
to
comply
upon
any
term
,
rather
than
incur
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
They
even
beg
of
me
to
admit
his
visit
once
more
,
and
use
all
their
little
eloquence
to
paint
the
calamity
I
be
go
to
endure
.
<EOS>
the
terror
of
a
prison
,
in
so
rigorous
a
season
as
the
present
,
with
the
danger
<EOS>
,
that
threaten
my
health
from
the
late
accident
that
happen
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
but
I
continue
inflexible
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
treasure
,
"
cry
I
,
"
why
will
you
thus
attempt
to
persuade
me
to
the
thing
that
be
not
right
!
<EOS>
My
duty
have
teach
me
to
forgive
him
;
but
my
conscience
will
not
permit
me
to
approve
.
<EOS>
Would
you
have
me
applaud
to
the
world
what
my
heart
must
internally
condemn
?
<EOS>
Would
you
have
me
tamely
sit
down
and
flatter
our
infamous
betrayer
;
and
to
avoid
a
prison
continually
suffer
the
more
gall
bond
of
mental
confinement
!
<EOS>
no
,
never
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
be
take
from
this
abode
,
only
let
us
hold
to
the
right
,
and
wherever
we
be
throw
,
we
can
still
retire
to
a
charming
apartment
,
when
we
can
look
round
our
own
heart
with
intrepidity
and
with
pleasure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
we
spend
that
evening
.
<EOS>
early
the
next
morning
,
as
the
snow
have
fall
in
great
abundance
in
the
night
,
my
son
be
employ
in
clear
it
away
,
and
open
a
passage
before
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
thus
engage
long
,
when
he
come
run
in
,
with
look
all
pale
,
to
tell
us
that
two
stranger
,
whom
he
know
to
be
officer
of
justice
,
be
make
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
he
speak
they
come
in
,
and
approach
the
bed
where
I
lay
,
after
previously
inform
me
of
their
employment
and
business
,
make
me
their
prisoner
,
bid
me
prepare
to
go
with
them
to
the
county
gaol

which
be
eleven
mile
off

say
I
,

this
be
severe
weather
on

you
have
come
to
take
me
to

this
time

throw
me
into

want
cloath
to
cover
me

I
be
now
too
weak

old
to
walk
far
in
such
deep
snow
:

if
it
must
be
so

I
then
turn
to
my
wife
and
child
,
and
direct
them
to
get
together
what
few
thing
be
leave
us
,
and
to
prepare
immediately
for
leave
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
them
to
be
expeditious
,
and
desire
my
son
to
assist
his
eld
sister
,
who
,
from
a
consciousness
that
she
be
the
cause
of
all
our
calamity

be
fall

and
have
lose
anguish
in
insensibility

I
encourage
my
wife

who
,
pale
and
tremble
,
clasp
our
affright
little
one
in
her
arm

that
cling
to
her
bosom
in
silence

dread
to
look
round
at

in

mean
time
my
young

prepare
for
our
departure
,
and
as
she
receive
several
hint
to
use
dispatch
,
in
about
an
hour
we
be
ready
to
depart

<EOS>
no

however
wretche
it
seem

some
sort
of
comfort
attend
it

set
forward
from
this
peaceful
neighbourhood

walk
on
slowly

My

daughter
be
enfeeble
by
a
slow
fever
,
which
have
begin
for
some
day
to
undermine
her
constitution

one
of
the
officer

who
have
an

kindly
take

behind
him

lead
one
of

the
other

I
lean
upon

We
be
now
get
from
my
late
dwelling
about
two
mile
,
when
we
see
a
crowd
run
and
shout
behind
us
,
consist
of
about
fifty
of
my
poor
parishioner
.
<EOS>
these
,
with
dreadful
imprecation
,
soon
seize
upon
the
two
officer
of
justice
,
and
swear
they
would
never
see
their

go
to
gaol
while

felicity
here

<EOS>
They
now
seem
all
repentance

melt
into
tear
,
come
one
after
the
other
to
bid
me
farewell
.
<EOS>
I
shake
each
tenderly
by
the
hand
,
and
leave
them
my
blessing
,
proceed
forward
without
meet
any
farth
interruption

<EOS>
some
hour
before
night
we
reach
the
town
,
or
rather
village
;
for
it
consist
but
of
a
few
mean
house
,
have
lose
all
its
former
opulence
,
and
retain
no
mark
of
its
ancient
superiority
but
the
gaol
.
  
<EOS>
upon
enter
,
we
put
up
at
an
inn
,
where
we
have
such
refreshment
as
could
most
readily
be
procure
,
and
I
sup
with
my
family
with
my
usual
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
after
see
them
properly
accommodate
for
that
night
,
I
next
attend
the
sheriff
's
officer
to
the
prison
,
which
have
formerly
be
build
for
the
purpose
of
war
,
and
consist
of
one
large
apartment
,
strongly
grate
,
and
pave
with
stone
,
common
to
both
felon
and
debtor
at
certain
hour
in
the
four
and
twenty
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
every
prisoner
have
a
separate
cell
,
where
he
be
lock
in
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
expect
upon
my
entrance
to
find
nothing
but
lamentation
,
and
various
sound
of
misery
;
but
it
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
the
prisoner
seem
all
employ
in
one
common
design
,
that
of
forget
thought
in
merriment
or
clamour
.
<EOS>
I
be
apprize
of
the
usual
perquisite
require
upon
these
occasion
,
and
immediately
comply
with
the
demand
,
though
the
little
money
I
have
be
very
near
be
all
exhausted
.
<EOS>
this
be
immediately
send
away
for
liquor
,
and
the
whole
prison
soon
be
fill
with
riot
,
laughter
,
and
prophaneness
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
"
cry
I
to
myself
,
"
shall
man
so
very
wicked
be
chearful
,
and
shall
I
be
melancholy
!
<EOS>
I
feel
only
the
same
confinement
with
them
,

I
think
I
have
more
reason
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
such
reflection
I
labour
to
become
chearful
;
but
chearfulness
be
never
yet
produce
by
effort
,
which
be
itself
painful
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
sit
therefore
in
a
corner
of
the
gaol
,
in
a
pensive
posture
,
one
of
my
fellow
prisoner
come
up
,
and
sit
by
me
,
enter
into
conversation
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
constant
rule
in
life
never
to
avoid
the
conversation
of
any
man
who
seem
to
desire
it
:
for
if
good
,
I
may
profit
by
his
instruction
;
if
bad
,
he
may
be
assist
by
mine
.
<EOS>
I
find
this
to
be
a
know
man
,
of
strong
unlettered
sense
;

a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
world
,
as
it
be
call
,
or

more
properly
speak
,
of
human
nature
on
the
wrong
side

<EOS>
He
ask
me
if
I
have
take
care
to
provide
myself
with
a
bed
,
which
be
a
circumstance
I
have
never
once
attend
to

<EOS>
"

cry
he
,
"
as

scoundrel

may
have

rich
man
at
this
day

but
rogue
as
I
be

still
I
may
be
your
friend

that
perhaps
when
you

expect
it

<EOS>
We
be
now
prevent
from
further
conversation
,
by
the
arrival
of
the
gaoler
's
servant
,
who
come
to
call
over
the
prisoner
name
,
and
lock
up
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
a
fellow
also
,
with
a
bundle
of
straw
for
my
bed
attend
,
who
lead
me
along
a
dark
narrow
passage
into
a
room
pave
like
the
common
prison
,
and
in
one
corner
of
this
I
spread
my
bed
,
and
the
cloath
give
me
by
my
fellow
prisoner
;
which
do
,
my
conductor
,
who
be
civil
enough
,
bade
me
a
good-
night
.
<EOS>
after
my
usual
meditation
,
and
have
praise
my
heavenly
corrector
,
I
lay
myself
down
and
sleep
with
the
utmost
tranquility
till
morning
.
     
<EOS>
a
reformation
in
the
gaol
.
<EOS>
to
make
law
complete
,
they
should
reward
as
well
as
punish
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
early
I
be
awaken
by
my
family
,
whom
I
find
in
tear
at
my
bed
-
side
.
<EOS>
the
gloomy
strength
of
every
thing
about
us
,
it
seem
,
have
daunt
them
.
<EOS>
I
gently
rebuke
their
sorrow
,
assure
them
I
have
never
sleep
with
great
tranquility
,
and
next
enquire
after
my
eld
daughter
,
who
be
not
among
them
.
<EOS>
They
inform
me
that
yesterday
's
uneasiness
and
fatigue
have
encrease
her
fever
,
and
it
be
judge
proper
to
leave
her
behind
.
<EOS>
My
next
care
be
to
send
my
son
to
procure
a
room
or
two
to
lodge
the
family
in
,
as
near
the
prison
as
conveniently
could
be
find
.
<EOS>
He
obey
;
but
could
only
find
one
apartment
,
which
be
hire
at
a
small
expence
,
for
his
mother
and
sister
,
the
gaoler
with
humanity
consent
to
let
him
and
his
two
little
brother
lie
in
the
prison
with
me
.
<EOS>
a
bed
be
therefore
prepared
for
them
in
a
corner
of
the
room
,
which
I
think
answer
very
conveniently
.
<EOS>
I
be
willing
however
previously
to
know
whether
my
little
child
choose
to
lie
in
a
place
which
seem
to
fright
them
upon
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
cry
I
,
"
<EOS>
my
good
boy
,
how
do
you
like
your
bed
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
not
afraid
to
lie
in
this
room
,
dark
as
it
appear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no

papa
,
"
say
Dick
,
"
I
be
not
afraid

lie
any
where
where
you
be

"
<EOS>
and
I
,
"
say
Bill
,
who
be
yet
but
four
year
old
,
"
love
every
place
good
that
my
papa
be
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
I
allot
to
each
of
the
family
what
they
be
to
do
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
be
particularly
direct
to
watch
her
decline
sister
's
health
;
my
wife
be
to
attend
me
;
my
little
boy
be
to
read
to
me
:
"
and
as
for
you
,
my
son
,
"
continue
I
,
<EOS>
"
it
be
by
the
labour
of
your
hand
we
must
all
hope
to
be
support
.
<EOS>
Your
wage
,
as
a
day
-
labourer
,
will
be
full
sufficient
,
with
proper
frugality
,
to
maintain
us
all
,
and
comfortably
too

<EOS>
Thou
art
now
sixteen
year
old

and
hast
strength
,
and
it
be
give
thee
,
my
son
,
for
very
useful
purpose
;
for
it
must
save
from
famine
your
helpless
parent
and
family
.
<EOS>
prepare
then
this
evening
to
look
out
for
work
against
to
-
morrow
,
and
bring
home
every
night
what
money
you
earn
,
for
our
support
.
"
  
<EOS>
have
thus
instruct
him
,
and
settle
the
rest
,
I
walk
down
to
the
common
prison
,
where
I
could
enjoy
more
air
and
room
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
long
there
when
the
execration
,
lewdness
,
and
brutality
that
invade
me
on
every
side
,
drive
me
back
to
my
apartment
again
.
<EOS>
here
I
sate
for
some
time
,
ponder
upon
the
strange
infatuation
of
wretch
,
who
find
all
mankind
in
open
arm
against
them
,
be
labour
to
make
themselves
a
future
and
a
tremendous
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Their
insensibility
excite
my
high
compassion
,
and
blot
my
own
uneasiness
from
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
even
appear
a
duty
incumbent
upon
me
to
attempt
to
reclaim
them
.
<EOS>
I
resolve
therefore
once
more
to
return
,
and
in
spite
of
their
contempt
to
give
them
my
advice
,
and
conquer
them
by
perseverance
.
<EOS>
go
therefore
among
them
again
,
I
inform
Mr
Jenkinson
of
my
design
,
at
which
he
laugh
heartily
,
but
communicate
it
to
the
rest
.
<EOS>
the
proposal
be
receive
with
the
great
good
-
humour
,
as
it
promise
to
afford
a
new
fund
of
entertainment
to
person
who
have
now
no
other
resource
for
mirth
,
but
what
could
be
derive
from
ridicule
or
debauchery
.
  
<EOS>
I
therefore
read
them
a
portion
of
the
service
with
a
loud
unaffected
voice
,
and
find
my
audience
perfectly
merry
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
lewd
whisper
,
groan
of
contrition
burlesque
,
winking
and
coughing
,
alternately
excited
laughter
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
continue
with
my
natural
solemnity
to
read
on
,
sensible
that
what
I
do
may
amend
some
,
but
could
itself
receive
no
contamination
from
any
.
  
<EOS>
after
read
,
I
enter
upon
my
exhortation
,
which
be
rather
calculate
at
first
to
amuse
them
than
to
reprove
.
<EOS>
I
previously
observe
,
that
no
other
motive
but
their
welfare
could
induce
me
to
this
;
that
I
be
their
fellow
prisoner
,
and
now
get
nothing
by
preach
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
,
I
say
,
to
hear
them
so
very
prophane
;
because
they
get
nothing
by
it
,
but
may
lose
a
great
deal
:
<EOS>
"
for
be
assure
,
my
friend
,
"
cry
I
,
"
<EOS>
for
you
be
my
friend
,
however
the
world
may
disclaim
your
friendship
,
though
you
swore
twelve
thousand
oath
in
a
day
,
it
would
not
put
one
penny
in
your
purse
.
<EOS>
then
what
signifie

upon
the
devil

court
his
friendship

you
find
how
scurvily
he
use
you
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
you
nothing
here
,
you
find
,
but
a
mouthful
of
oath
and
an
empty
belly
;
and
by
the
good
account
I
have
of
him
,
he
will
give
you
nothing
that
be
good
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
use
ill
in
our
dealing
with
one
man
,
we
naturally
go
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
worth
your
while
then
,
just
to
try
how
you
may
like
the
usage
of
another
master
,
who
give
you
fair
promise
at
least
to
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
surely
,
my
friend
,
of
all
stupidity
in
the
world
,
his
must
be
great
,
who
,
after
rob
an
house
,
run
to
the
thieftaker
for
protection
.
<EOS>
and
yet
how
be
you
more
wise
?
<EOS>
You
be
all
seek
comfort
from
one
that
have
already
betray
you
,
apply
to
a
more
malicious
being
than
any
thieftaker
of
them
all
;
for
they
only
decoy
,
and
then
hang
you
;
but
he
decoy
and
hang
,
and
what
be
bad
of
all
,
will
not
let
you
loose
after
the
hangman
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
conclude
,
I
receive
the
compliment
of
my
audience
,
some
of
whom
come
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
,
swear
that
I
be
a
very
honest
fellow
,
and
that
they
desire
my
further
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
promise
to
repeat
my
lecture
next
day
,
and
actually
conceive
some
hope
of
make
a
reformation
here
;
for
it
have
ever
be
my
opinion
,
that
no
man
be
past
the
hour
of
amendment
,
every
heart
lie
open
to
the
shaft
of
reproof
,
if
the
archer
could
but
take
a
proper
aim
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
thus
satisfy
my
mind
,
I
go
back
to
my
apartment
,
where
my
wife
have
prepare
a
frugal
meal
,
while
Mr
Jenkinson
beg
leave
to
add
his
dinner
to
ours
,
and
partake
of
the
pleasure
,
as
he
be
kind
enough
to
express
it
of
my
conversation
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
yet
see
my
family
,
for
as
they
come
to
my
apartment
by
a
door
in
the
narrow
passage
,
already
describe
,
by
this
mean
they
avoid
the
common
prison
.
<EOS>
Jenkinson
at
the
first
interview
therefore
seem
not
a
little
strike
with
the
beauty
of
my
young
daughter
,
which
her
pensive
air
contribute
to
heighten
,
and
my
little
one
do
not
pass
unnoticed
.
  
<EOS>
"
alas
,
Doctor
,
"
cry
he
,
"
these
child
be
too
handsome
and
too
good
for
such
a
place
as
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
why
,
Mr
Jenkinson
'
,
reply
I
,
"
thank
heaven
<EOS>
my
child
be
pretty
tolerable
in
moral
,
and
if
they
be
good
,
it
matter
little

the
rest

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
sir

"
return
my
fellow

"
that
it
must
give
you
great
comfort

have
this
little

about
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
a
comfort
,
Mr
Jenkinson

reply
I
,
"
yes
it
be
indeed
a
comfort
,
and
I
would
not
be
without
them
for
all
the

for
they
can
make
a
dungeon
seem
a
palace

<EOS>
there
be
but
one
way
in
this
life
of
wound
my
happiness

that
be
by
injure

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
then
,
sir

"
cry
he
,
"
that
I
be
in
some
measure
culpable
;
for
I
think
I
see
here
(
look
at
my
son
Moses
)
<EOS>
one
that
I
have
injure
,
and
by
whom
I
wish
to
be
forgive

"
  
<EOS>
My
son
immediately
recollect
his
voice
and
feature
,
though
he
have
before
see
him
in
disguise
,
and
take
him
by
the
hand
,
with
a
smile
forgave
him
.
"
<EOS>
yet
,
"
continue
he
,
"
I
can
not
help
wonder
at
what
you
could
see
in
my
face

me
a

deception

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir

"
return
the
other

it
be
not
your
face

your
white
stocking

the
black
ribband
in
your
hair

that
allure
me
.
<EOS>

no
disparagement
to
your
part

I
have
deceive
wise
man

you
in
my
time

and
yet
,
with
all
my
trick

the
blockhead
have
be
too
many
for
me
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
cry
my
son
,
"
<EOS>
that
the
narrative
of
such
a
life
as
yours
must
be
extremely
instructive
and
amusing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
much
of
either
,
"
return
Mr
Jenkinson
.
<EOS>
"
those
relation
which
describe
the
trick
and
vice
only
of
mankind
,
by
increase
our
suspicion
in
life
,
retard
our
success
.
<EOS>
the
traveller
that
distrust
every
person
he
meet
,
and
turn
back
upon
the
appearance
of
every
man
that
look
like
a
robber
,
seldom
arrive
in
time
at
his
journey
's
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
think
from
my
own
experience
,
that
the
know
one
be
the
silly
fellow
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
I
be
think
cunne
from
my
very
childhood
;
when
but
seven
year
old
the
lady
would
say
that
I
be
a
perfect
little
man
;
at
fourteen
I
know
the
world
,
cock
my
hat
,
and
love
the
lady
;
at
twenty
,
though
I
be
perfectly
honest
,
yet
every
one
think
me
so
cunning
,
that
not
one
would
trust
me
.
<EOS>
thus
I
be
at
last
oblige
to
turn
sharp
in
my
own
defence
,
and
have
live
ever
since
,
my
head
throb
with
scheme
to
deceive
,
and
my
heart
palpitate
with
fear
of
detection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
use
often
to
laugh
at
your
honest
simple
neighbour
Flamborough
,
and
one
way
or
another
generally
cheat
him
once
a
year
.
<EOS>
yet
still
the
honest
man
go
forward
without
suspicion
,
and
grow
rich
,
while
I
still
continue
tricksy
and
cunning
,
and
be
poor
,
without
the
consolation
of
be
honest
.
  
<EOS>
"
however
,
"
continue
he
,
"
let
me
know
your
case
,
and
what
have
bring
you
here
;
perhaps
though
I
have
not
skill
to
avoid
a
gaol
myself
,
I
may
extricate
my
friend
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
compliance
with
his
curiosity
,
I
inform
him
of
the
whole
train
of
accident
and
folly
that
have
plunge
me
into
my
present
trouble
,
and
my
utter
inability
to
get
free
.
  
<EOS>
after
hear
my
story
,
and
pause
some
minute
,
he
slapt
his
forehead
,
as
if
he
have
hit
upon
something
material
,
and
take
his
leave
,
say
he
would
try
what
could
be
do
.
     
<EOS>
the
same
subject
continue
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
communicate
to
my
wife
and
child
the
scheme
I
have
plan
of
reform
the
prisoner
,
which
they
receive
with
universal
disapprobation
,
alledge
the
impossibility
and
impropriety
of
it
;
add
,
that
my
endeavour
would
no
way
contribute
to
their
amendment
,
but
may
probably
disgrace
my
calling
.
  
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
"
return
I
,
"
<EOS>
these
people
,
however
fall
,
be
still
man
,
and
that
be
a
very
good
title
to
my
affection
.
<EOS>
good
council
reject
return
to
enrich
the
giver
's
bosom
;
and
though
the
instruction
I
communicate
may
not
mend
them
,
yet
it
will
assuredly
mend
myself
.
<EOS>
if
these
wretch
,
my
child
,
be
prince
,
there
would
be
thousand
ready
to
offer
their
ministry
;
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
heart
that
be
bury
in
a
dungeon
be
as
precious
as
that
seat
upon
a
throne
.
<EOS>
yes
,
my
treasure
,
if
I
can
mend
them
I
will
;
perhaps
they
will
not
all
despise
me
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
catch
up
even
one
from
the
gulph
,
and
,
that
will
be
great
gain
;
for
be
there
upon
earth
a
gem
so
precious
as
the
human
soul
?
"
  
<EOS>
thus
say
,
I
leave
them
,
and
descend
to
the
common
prison
,
where
I
find
the
prisoner
very
merry
,
expect
my
arrival
;
and
each
prepared
with
some
gaol
trick
to
play
upon
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
thus
,
as
I
be
go
to
begin
,
one
turn
my
wig
awry
,
as
if
by
accident
,
and
then
ask
my
pardon
.
<EOS>
a
second
,
who
stand
at
some
distance
,
have
a
knack
of
spit
through
his
tooth
,
which
fall
in
shower
upon
my
book
.
<EOS>
a
third
would
cry
amen
in
such
an
affected
tone
as
give
the
rest
great
delight
.
<EOS>
a
fourth
have
slily
pick
my
pocket
of
my
spectacle
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
whose
trick
give
more
universal
pleasure
than
all
the
rest
;
for
observe
the
manner
in
which
I
have
dispose
my
book
on
the
table
before
me
,
he
very
dextrously
displace
one
of
them
,
and
put
an
obscene
jest
-
book
of
his
own
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
however
I
take
no
notice
of
all
that
this
mischievous
groupe
of
little
being
could
do
;
but
go
on
,
perfectly
sensible
that
what
be
ridiculous
in
my
attempt
,
would
excite
mirth
only
the
first
or
second
time
,
while
what
be
serious
would
be
permanent
.
<EOS>
My
design
succeed
,
and
in
less
than
six
day
some
be
penitent
,
and
all
attentive
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
that
I
applaud
my
perseverance
and
address
,
at
thus
give
sensibility
to
wretch
divest
of
every
moral
feeling
,
and
now
begin
to
think
of
do
them
temporal
service
also
,
by
render
their
situation
somewhat
more
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Their
time
have
hitherto
be
divide
between
famine
and
excess
,
tumultous
riot
and
bitter
repining
.
<EOS>
Their
only
employment
be
quarrel
among
each
other
,
play
at
cribbage
,
and
cut
tobacco
stopper
.
<EOS>
from
this
last
mode
of
idle
industry
I
take
the
hint
of
set
such
as
choose
to
work
at
cut
peg
for
tobacconist
and
shoemaker
,
the
proper
wood
be
buy
by
a
general
subscription
,
and
when
manufacture
,
sell
by
my
appointment
;
so
that
each
earn
something
every
day
:
a
trifle
indeed
,
but
sufficient
to
maintain
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
stop
here
,
but
institute
fine
for
the
punishment
of
immorality
,
and
reward
for
peculiar
industry
.
<EOS>
thus
in
less
than
a
fortnight
I
have
form
them
into
something
social
and
humane
,
and
have
the
pleasure
of
regard
myself
as
a
legislator
,
who
have
bring
man
from
their
native
ferocity
into
friendship
and
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
and
it
be
<EOS>
highly
to
be
wish
,
that
legislative
power
would
thus
direct
the
law
rather
to
reformation
than
severity
.
<EOS>
that
it
would
seem
convinced
that
the
work
of
eradicate
crime
be
not
by
make
punishment
familiar
,
but
formidable
.
<EOS>
then
instead
of
our
present
prison
,
which
find
or
make
man
guilty
,
which
enclose
wretch
for
the
commission
of
one
crime
,
and
return
them
,
if
return
alive
,
fit
for
the
perpetration
of
thousand
;
we
should
see
,
as
in
other
part
of
Europe
,
place
of
penitence
and
solitude
,
where
the
accuse
may
be
attend
by
such
as
could
give
them
repentance
if
guilty
,
or
new
motive
to
virtue
if
innocent
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
but
not
the
increase
punishment
,
be
the
way
to
mend
a
state
:
nor
can
I
avoid
even
question
the
validity
of
that
right
<EOS>
which
social
combination
have
assume
of
capitally
punish
offence
of
a
slight
nature
.
<EOS>
in
case
of
murder
their
right
be
obvious
,
as
it
be
the
duty
of
us
all
,
from
the
law
of
self
-
defence
,
to
cut
off
that
man
who
have
shew
a
disregard
for
the
life
of
another
.
<EOS>
against
such
,
all
nature
arise
in
arm
;
but
it
be
not
so
against
him
who
steal
my
property
.
<EOS>
natural
law
give
me
no
right
to
take
away
his
life
,
as
by
that
the
horse
he
steal
be
as
much
his
property
as
mine
.
<EOS>
if
then
I
have
any
right
,
it
must
be
from
a
compact
make
between
us
,
that
he
who
deprive
the
other
of
his
horse
shall
die
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
false
compact
;
because
no
man
have
a
right
to
barter
his
life
,
no
more
than
to
take
it
away
,
as
it
be
not
his
own
.
<EOS>
and
beside
,
the
compact
be
inadequate
,
and
would
be
set
aside
even
in
a
court
of
modern
equity
,
as
there
be
a
great
penalty
for
a
very
trifling
convenience
,
since
it
be
far
well
that
two
man
should
live
,
than
that
one
man
should
ride
.
<EOS>
but
a
compact
that
be
false
between
two
man
,
be
equally
so
between
an
hundred
,
or
an
hundred
thousand
;
<EOS>
for
as
ten
million
of
circle
can
never
make
a
square
,
so
the
united
voice
of
myriad
can
not
lend
the
small
foundation
to
falsehood
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
reason
speak
,
and
<EOS>
untutored
nature
say
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
savage
that
be
direct
by
natural
law
alone
be
very
tender
of
the
life
of
each
other
;
they
seldom
shed
blood
but
to
retaliate
former
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
Our
Saxon
ancestor
,
fierce
as
they
be
in
war
,
have
but
few
execution
in
time
of
peace
;
and
in
all
commence
government
that
have
the
print
of
nature
still
strong
upon
them
,
scarce
any
crime
be
hold
capital
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
among
the
citizen
of
a
refined
community
that
penal
law
,
which
be
in
the
hand
of
the
rich
,
be
lay
upon
the
poor
.
<EOS>
government
,
while
it
grow
old
,
seem
to
acquire
the
moroseness
of
age
;
and
as
if
our
property
be
become
dearer
in
proportion
as
it
increase
,
as
if
the
more
enormous
our
wealth
,
the
more
extensive
our
fear
,
all
our
possession
be
pale
up
with
new
edict
every
day
,
and
hang
round
with
gibbet
to
scare
every
invader
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
whether
it
be
from
the
number
of
our
penal
law
,
or
the
licentiousness
of
our
people
,
that
this
country
should
shew
more
convict
in
a
year
,
than
half
the
dominion
of
Europe
unite
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
owe
to
both
;
for
they
mutually
produce
each
other
.
<EOS>
when
by
indiscriminate
penal
law
a
nation
behold
the
same
punishment
affix
to
dissimilar
degree
of
guilt
,
from
perceive
no
distinction
in
the
penalty
,
the
people
be
lead
to
lose
all
sense
of
distinction
in
the
crime
,
and
this
distinction
be
the
bulwark
of
all
morality
:
thus
the
multitude
of
law
produce
new
vice
,
and
new
vice
call
for

it

after

,
"
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
just
thus
to
obstruct
the
union
of
man

,
which
you
do
at
present
,
by
refuse
to
consent

a

which
you
can

may
render

"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
reply
I
,
"
you
be
unacquainted
with
the
man
that
oppress
us
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sensible
that
no
submission
I
can
make
could
procure
me
liberty
even
for
an
hour
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
even
in
this
very
room
a
debtor
of
his
,
no
later
than
last
year
,
die
for
want
.
<EOS>
but
though
my
submission
and
approbation
could
transfer
me
from
hence
,
to
the
most
beautiful
apartment
he
be
possess
of
;
yet
I
would
grant
neither
,
as
something
whisper
me
that
it
would
be
give
a
sanction
to
adultery
.
<EOS>
while
my
daughter
live
,
no
other
marriage
of
his
shall
ever
be
legal
in
my
eye

<EOS>
be
she
remove
,
indeed
,
I
should
be
the
basest
of
man
,
from
any
resentment
of
my
own
,
to
attempt
put
asunder
those
who
wish
for
an
union

<EOS>
no

villain
as
he
be
,
I
should
then
wish
him
married
,
to
prevent
the
consequence
of
his
future
debauchery
.
<EOS>
but
now
should
I
not
be
the
most
cruel
of
all
father
,
to
sign
an
instrument
which
must
send
my
child
to
the
grave
,
merely
to
avoid
a
prison
myself
;
and
thus
to
escape
one
pang
,
break
my
child
's
heart
with
a
thousand
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
acquiesce
in
the
justice
of
this
answer
,
but
could
not
avoid
observe
,
that
he
fear
my
daughter
's
life
be
already
too
much
waste

keep
me
long
a

<EOS>
however
,
"
continue
he
,
"
though
you
refuse

your

uncle

who
have
the
first
character

<EOS>
I
would
advise
you
to
send
him
a
letter
by
the
post
,
intimate
all
his
nephew
's
ill
usage
,
and
my
life
for
it
that
in
three
day
you
shall
have
an
answer

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
thank'd
him
for
the
hint
,
and
instantly
set
about
comply
;
but
I
want
paper
,
and
unluckily
all
our
money
have
be
lay
out
that
morning
in
provision
,
however
he
supply
me

<EOS>
for
the
three
ensue
day
I
be
in
a
state
of
anxiety

to
know
what
reception
my
letter
may
meet
with

but
in
the
mean
time
be
frequently
solicit
by
my
wife
to
submit
to
any
condition
rather
than
remain
here
,
and
every
hour
receive
repeat
account
of
the
decline
of
my
daughter
's
health
.
<EOS>
the
third
day
and
the
fourth
arrive
,
but
I
receive
no
answer
to
my
letter
:
the
complaint
of
a
stranger
against
a
favourite
nephew
,
be
no
way
likely
to
succeed
;
so
that
these
hope
soon
vanish
like
all
my
former
.
<EOS>
My
mind
,
however
,
still
support
itself
though
confinement
and
bad
air
begin
to
make
a
visible
alteration
in
my
health

my
arm

My

sate
by

stretch
on

read
to
me
by
turn

or
listen

weep
at
my
instruction

<EOS>
but
my
daughter
's
health
decline
faster
than
mine
;
every
message
from
her

to
encrease
my
apprehension

pain

<EOS>
the
fifth
morning
after
I
have
write
the

be
send

sit
William
Thornhill

I
be
alarm
with
an
account

<EOS>
now
it

Mr

prattle

observe
that
now
my

my

which
be
every

He

that
it
be
now
incumbent
on
me
to
sacrifice
any
pride
or
resentment
of
my
own

to
the
welfare
of
those
who
depend
on
me
for
support

that
I

both
by
reason

oblige
to
try
to
reconcile
my

<EOS>
"

"
there

on

one

no

Mr

He
have
some
difficulty

he
say
,
to
get
a
sight
of
his

as
the

up

when

as
for

that
all

not

He
observe

upon
which
,
with

:
    
Honoured
Sir

I
have
call
off
my
imagination
a
few
moment
from
the
pleasure
that
surround
me
,
to
fix
it
upon
object
that
be
still
more
pleasing

the
dear
little
fire

side

My
fancy
draw
that
harmless
groupe
as
listen
to
every
line
of
this
with
great
composure

<EOS>
I
view
those
face
with
delight
which
never
feel
the
deforming
hand
of
ambition
or
distress
!
<EOS>
but
whatever
your
happiness
may
be
at
home
,
I
be
sure
it
will
be
some
addition
to
it
,
to
hear
that
I
be
perfectly
pleased
with
my
situation
,
and
every
way
happy
here
.

Our
regiment
be
countermand

be
not

take
me
with
him
to
all
company

dance
last

I
may

perhaps
successful

it

I
be
myself

by
most
of
my
absent
friend

<EOS>
in
this
number
,
I
fear
,
Sir

that
I
must
consider
you
;

I
have
long
expect
the
pleasure
of
a
letter
from
home

no

<EOS>
Olivia
and
Sophia
too

promise
to
write

seem
to
have
forget

<EOS>
tell
them
they
be
two
arrant
little
baggage

that
I
be
this
moment
in
a
most
violent
passion
with
them

I
know
not
how

tho
'
I
want
to
bluster
a
little

my
heart
be
respondent

soft
emotion

then
tell
them

that
after
all
,
I
love
them
affectionately

be
assure
of
my
ever
remain
   
Your

have

"
I
have
scarce
say
these
word

when
a
noise

like
that
of
a
tumult
,
seem
to
proceed
from
the
prison
below
;
it
die
away
soon
after

a
clanking
of
fetter

along

of

bloody

wound

the
heavy
iron

I
look
with
compassion
on
the
wretch

approach

with
horror
when
I
find

"
  
<EOS>
I
try
to
restrain
my
passion
for
a
few
minute
in
silence
,
but
I
think
I
should
have
die
with
the
effort

how
,
Sir

forgetful
of

thus
to
arrogate
the

<EOS>
no

it

for
that
vile
death

must
shortly
suffer

<EOS>
"
My
child

you
must
not
die
:
I
be
sure
no
offence
of
thine
can
deserve
so
vile
a
punishment

<EOS>
My
George
could
never
be
guilty

any
crime

ashamed
of
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mine
,
Sir
,
"
return
my
son
,
"
be
,
I
fear
,
an
unpardonable
one
.
<EOS>
when
I
receive
my
mother
's
letter
from
home
,
I
immediately
come
down
,
determine
to
punish
the
betrayer
of
our
honour
,
and
send
him
an
order
to
meet
me
,
which
he
answer
,
not
in
person
,
but
by
his
dispatch
four
of
his
domestic
to
seize
me
.
<EOS>
I
wound
one
who
first
assault
me
,
and
I
fear
desperately
,
but
the
rest
make
me
their
prisoner
.
<EOS>
the
coward
be
determined
to
put
the
law
in
execution
against
me
,
the
proof
be
undeniable
,
I
have
send
a
challenge
,
and
as
I
be
the
first
transgressor
upon
the
statute
,
I
see
no
hope
of
pardon
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
often
charm
me
with
your
lesson
of
fortitude
,
let
me
now
,
Sir
,
find
them
in
your
example
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
my
son
,
you
shall
find
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
raise
above
this
world
,
and
all
the
pleasure
it
can
produce
.
<EOS>
from
this
moment
I
break
from
my
heart
all
the
tie
that
hold
it
down
to
earth
,
and
will
prepare
to
fit
us
both
for
eternity
.
<EOS>
yes
,
my
son
,
I
will
point
out
the
way
,
and
my
soul
shall
guide
yours
in
the
ascent
,
for
we
will
take
our
flight
together
.
<EOS>
I
now
see
and
be
convince
you
can
expect
no
pardon
here
,
and
I
can
only
exhort
you
to
seek
it
at
that
great
tribunal
where
we
both
shall
shortly
answer
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
not
be
niggardly
in
our
exhortation
,
but
let
all
our
fellow
prisoner
have
a
share
:
good
gaoler
let
them
be
permit
to
stand
here
,
while
I
attempt
to
improve
them
.
"
<EOS>
thus
say
,
I
make
an
effort
to
rise
from
my
straw
,
but
want
strength
,
and
be
able
only
to
recline
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
the
prisoner
assemble
accord
to
my
direction
,
for
they
love
to
hear
my
council
,
my
son
and
his
mother
support
me
on
either
side
,
I
look
and
see
that
none
be
want
,
and
then
address
them
with
the
follow
exhortation
.
     
<EOS>
the
equal
dealing
of
providence
demonstrate
with
regard
to
the
happy
and
the
miserable
here
below
.
<EOS>
that
from
the
nature
of
pleasure
and
pain
,
the
wretched
must
be
repay
the
balance
of
their
suffering
in
the
life
hereafter
  
<EOS>
My
friend
,
my
child
,
and
fellow
sufferer
,
when
I
reflect
on
the
distribution
of
good
and
evil
here
below
,
I
find
that
much
have
be
give
man
to
enjoy
,
yet
still
more
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
though
we
should
examine
the
whole
world
,
we
shall
not
find
one
man
so
happy
as
to
have
nothing
leave
to
wish
for
;
but
we
daily
see
thousand
who
by
suicide
shew
us
<EOS>
they
have
nothing
leave
to
hope
.
<EOS>
in
this
life
then
it
appear
that
we
can
not
be
entirely
bl
;
but
yet
we
may
be
completely
miserable
!
  
<EOS>
why
man
should
thus
feel
pain
,
why
our
wretchedness
should
be
requisite
in
the
formation
of
universal
felicity
,
why
,
when
all
other
system
be
make
perfect
by
the
perfection
of
their
subordinate
part
,
the
great
system
should
require
for
its
perfection
,
part
that
be
not
only
subordinate
to
other
,
but
imperfect
in
themselves
?
<EOS>
these
be
question
that
never
can
be
explain
,
and
may
be
useless
if
know
.
<EOS>
on
this
subject
providence
have
think
fit
to
elude
our
curiosity
,
satisfied
with
grant
us
motive
to
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
situation
,
man
have
call
in
the
friendly
assistance
of
philosophy
,
and
heaven
see
the
incapacity
of
that
to
console
him
,
have
give
him
the
aid
of
religion
.
<EOS>
the
consolation
of
philosophy
be
very
amusing
,
but
often
fallacious
.
<EOS>
It
tell
us
that
life
be
fill
with
comfort
,
if
we
will
but
enjoy
them
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
that
though
we
unavoidably
have
misery
here
,
life
be
short
,
and
they
will
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
thus
do
these
consolation
destroy
each
other
;
for
if
life
be
a
place
of
comfort
,
its
shortness
must
be
misery
,
and
if
it
be
long
,
our
grief
be
protract
.
<EOS>
thus
philosophy
be
weak
;
but
religion
comfort
in
an
high
strain
.
<EOS>
man
be
here
,
it
tell
us
,
fit
up
his
mind
,
and
prepare
it
for
another
abode
.
<EOS>
when
the
good
man
leave
the
body
and
be
all
a
glorious
mind
,
he
will
find
he
have
be
make
himself
a
heaven
of
happiness
here
,
while
the
wretch
that
have
be
maim
and
contaminate
by
his
vice
,
shrink
from
his
body
with
terror
,
and
find
that
he
have
anticipate
the
vengeance
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
to
religion
then
we
must
hold
in
every
circumstance
of
life
for
our
true
comfort
;
for
if
already
we
be
happy
,
it
be
a
pleasure
to
think
that
we
can
make
that
happiness
unending
,
and
if
we
be
miserable
,
it
be
very
consoling
to
think
that
there
be
a
place
of
rest
.
<EOS>
thus
to
the
fortunate
religion
hold
out
a
continuance
of
bliss
,
to
the
wretched
a
change
from
pain
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
religion
be
very
kind
to
all
man
,
it
have
promise
peculiar
reward
to
the
unhappy
;
the
sick
,
the
naked
,
the
houseless
,
the
heavy
-
laden
,
and
the
prisoner
,
have
ever
most
frequent
promise
in
our
sacred
law
.
<EOS>
the
author
of
our
religion
every
where
profess
himself
the
wretch
's
friend
,
and
unlike
the
false
one
of
this
world
,
bestow
all
his
caress
upon
the
forlorn
.
<EOS>
the
unthinking
have
censure
this
as
partiality
,
as
a
preference
without
merit
to
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
but
they
never
reflect
that
it
be
not
in
the
power
even
of
heaven
itself
to
make
the
offer
of
uncease
felicity
as
great
a
gift
to
the
happy
as
to
the
miserable
.
<EOS>
to
the
first
eternity
be
but
a
single
blessing
,
since
at
most
it
but
encrease
what
they
already
possess
.
<EOS>
to
the
latter
it
be
a
double
advantage
;
for
it
diminish
their
pain
here
,
and
reward
them
with
heavenly
bliss
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
but
providence
be
in
another
respect
kinder
to
the
poor
than
the
rich
;
for
as
it
thus
make
the
life
after
death
more
desirable
,
so
it
smooth
the
passage
there
.
<EOS>
the
wretched
have
have
a
long
familiarity
with
every
face
of
terror
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
sorrow
lay
himself
quietly
down
,
without
possession
to
regret
,
and
but
few
tie
to
stop
his
departure
<EOS>
:
he
feel
only
nature
's
pang
in
the
final
separation
,
and
this
be
no
way
great
than
he
have
often
faint
under
before
;
for
after
a
certain
degree
of
pain
,
every
new
breach
that
death
open
in
the
constitution
,
nature
kindly
cover
with
insensibility
.
  
<EOS>
thus
providence
have
give
the
wretched
two
advantage
over
the
happy
,
in
this
life
,
great
felicity
in
die
,
and
in
heaven
all
that
superiority
of
pleasure
which
arise
from
contrast
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
and
this
superiority
,
my
friend
,
be
no
small
advantage
,
and
seem
to
be
one
of
the
pleasure
of
the
poor
man
in
the
parable
;
for
though
he
be
already
in
heaven
,
and
feel
all
the
rapture
it
could
give
,
yet
it
be
mention
as
an
addition
to
his
happiness
,
that
he
have
once
be
wretched
and
now
be
comfort
,
that
he
have
know
what
it
be
to
be
miserable
,
and
now
feel
what
it
be
to
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
my
friend
,
you
see
religion
do
what
philosophy
could
never
do
:
it
shew
the
equal
dealing
of
heaven
to
the
happy
and
the
unhappy
,
and
level
all
human
enjoyment
to
nearly
the
same
standard
.
<EOS>
It
give
to
both
rich
and
poor
the
same
happiness
hereafter
,
and
equal
hope
to
aspire
after
it
;
but
if
the
rich
have
the
advantage
of
enjoy
pleasure
here
,
the
poor
have
the
endless
satisfaction
of
know
what
it
be
once
to
be
miserable
,
when
crown
with
endless
felicity
hereafter
;
and
even
though
this
should
be
call
a
small
advantage
,
yet
be
an
eternal
one
,
it
must
make
up
by
duration
what
the
temporal
happiness
of
the
great
may
have
exceed
by
intenseness
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
therefore
the
consolation
which
the
wretched
have
peculiar
to
themselves
,
and
in
which
they
be
above
the
rest
of
mankind
;
in
other
respect
they
be
below
them
.
<EOS>
They
who
would
know
the
misery
of
the
poor
must
see
life
and
endure
it
.
<EOS>
to
declaim
on
the
temporal
advantage
they
enjoy
,
be
only
repeat
what
none
either
believe
or
practise
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
the
necessary
of
living
be
not
poor
,
and
they
who
want
them
must
be
miserable
.
<EOS>
yes
,
my
friend
,
we
must
be
miserable
.
<EOS>
no
vain
effort
of
a
refined
imagination
can
sooth
the
want
of
nature
,
can
give
elastic
sweetness
to
the
dank
vapour
of
a
dungeon
,
or
ease
to
the
throbbing
of
a
broken
heart
.
<EOS>
let
the
philosopher
from
his
couch
of
softness
tell
us
that
we
can
resist
all
these
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
the
effort
by
which
we
resist
them
be
still
the
great
pain
!
<EOS>
death
be
slight
,
and
any
man
may
sustain
it
;
but
torment
be
dreadful
,
and
these
no
man
can
endure
.
  
<EOS>
to
us
then
,
my
friend
,
the
promise
of
happiness
in
heaven
should
be
peculiarly
dear
;
for
if
our
reward
be
in
this
life
alone
,
we
be
then
indeed
of
all
man
the
most
miserable
.
<EOS>
when
I
look
round
these
gloomy
wall
,
make
to
terrify
,
as
well
as
to
confine
us
;
this
light
that
only
serve
to
shew
the
horror
of
the
place
,
those
shackle
that
tyranny
have
impose
,
or
crime
make
necessary
;
when
I
survey
these
emaciate
look
,
and
hear
those
groan
,
o
my
friend
,
what
a
glorious
exchange
would
heaven
be
for
these
.
<EOS>
to
fly
through
region
unconfine
as
air
,
to
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
eternal
bliss
,
to
carrol
over
endless
hymn
of
praise
,
to
have
no
master
to
threaten
or
insult
us
,
but
the
form
of
goodness
himself
for
ever
in
our
eye
,
when
I
think
of
these
thing
,
death
become
the
messenger
of
very
glad
tiding
;
when
I
think
of
these
thing
,
his
sharp
arrow
become
the
staff
of
my
support
;
when
I
think
of
these
thing
,
what
be
there
in
life
worth
have
;
when
I
think
of
these
thing
,
what
be
there
that
should
not
be
spurn
away
:
king
in
their
palace
should
groan
for
such
advantage
;
but
we
,
humble
as
we
be
,
should
yearn
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
shall
these
thing
be
ours
?
<EOS>
ours
they
will
certainly
be
if
we
but
try
for
them
;
and
what
be
a
comfort
,
we
be
shut
out
from
many
temptation
that
would
retard
our
pursuit
.
<EOS>
only
let
us
try
for
them
,
and
they
will
certainly
be
ours
,
and
what
be
still
a
comfort
,
shortly
too
;
<EOS>
for
if
we
look
back
on
past
life
,
it
appear
but
a
very
short
span
,
and
whatever
we
may
think
of
the
rest
of
life
,
it
will
yet
be
find
of
less
duration
;
as
we
grow
old
,
the
day
seem
to
grow
short
,
and
our
intimacy
with
time
,
ever
lessen
the
perception
of
his
stay
.
<EOS>
then
let
us
take
comfort
now
,
for
we
shall
soon
be
at
our
journey
's
end
;
we
shall
soon
lay
down
the
heavy
burthen
lay
by
heaven
upon
us
,
and
though
death
,
the
only
friend
of
the
wretched
,
for
a
little
while
mock
the
weary
traveller
with
the
view
,
and
like
his
horizon
,
still
fly
before
him
;
yet
the
time
will
certainly
and
shortly
come
,
when
we
shall
cease
from
our
toil
;
when
the
luxurious
great
one
of
the
world
shall
no
more
tread
us
to
the
earth
;
when
we
shall
think
with
pleasure
on
our
suffering
below
;
when
we
shall
be
surround
with
all
our
friend
,
or
such
as
deserve
our
friendship
;
when
our
bliss
shall
be
unutterable
,
and
still
,
to
crown
all
,
unending
.
     
<EOS>
Happier
prospect
begin
to
appear
.
<EOS>
let
us
be
inflexible
,
and
fortune
will
at
last
change
in
our
favour
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
thus
finish
and
my
audience
be
retire
,
the
gaoler
,
who
be
one
of
the
most
humane
of
his
profession
,
hope
I
would
not
be
displeased
,
as
what
he
do
be
but
his
duty
,
observe
that
he
must
be
oblige
to
remove
my
son
into
a
strong
cell
,
but
that
he
should
be
permit
to
revisit
me
every
morning
.
<EOS>
I
thank
him
for
his
clemency
,
and
grasp
my
boy
's
hand
,
bade
him
farewell
,
and
be
mindful
of
the
great
duty
that
be
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
again
,
therefore
lay
me
down
,
and
one
of
my
little
one
sate
by
my
bedside
reading
,
when
Mr
Jenkinson
enter
,
inform
me
that
there
be
news
of
my
daughter
;
for
that
she
be
see
by
a
person
about
two
hour
before
in
a
strange
gentleman
's
company
,
and
that
they
have
stopt
at
a
neighbouring
village
for
refreshment
,
and
seem
as
if
return
to
town
.
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
deliver
this
news
,
when
the
gaoler
come
with
look
of
haste
and
pleasure
,
to
inform
me
,
that
my
daughter
be
find
.
<EOS>
Moses
come
run
in
a
moment
after
,
cry
out
that
his
sister
Sophy
be
below
and
come
up
with
our
old
friend
Mr
Burchell
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
he
deliver
this
news
my
dear
girl
enter
,
and
with
look
almost
wild
with
pleasure
,
run
to
kiss
me
in
a
transport
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
tear
and
silence
also
shew
her
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
,
pappa
,
"
cry
the
charming
girl
,
"
here
be
the
brave
man
to
whom
I
owe
my
delivery
;
to
this
gentleman
's
intrepidity
I
be
indebted
for
my
happiness
and
safety
 
<EOS>
"
a
kiss
from
Mr
Burchell
,
whose
pleasure
seem
even
great
than
her
,
interrupt
what
she
be
go
to
add
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Mr
Burchell
,
"
cry
I
,
"
this
be
but
a
wretched
habitation
you
now
find
us
in
;
and
we
be
now
very
different
from
what
you
last
see
us
.
<EOS>
You
be
ever
our
friend
:
we
have
long
discover
our
error
with
regard
to
you
,
and
repent
of
our
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
after
the
vile
usage
you
then
receive
at
my
hand
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
behold
your
face
;
yet
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
,
as
I
be
deceive
by
a
base
ungenerous
wretch
,
who
,
under
the
mask
of
friendship
,
have
undo
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
,
"
reply
Mr
Burchell
,
"
that
I
should
forgive
you
,
as
you
never
deserve
my
resentment
.
<EOS>
I
partly
see
your
delusion
then
,
and
as
it
be
out
of
my
power
to
restrain
,
I
could
only
pity
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
ever
my
conjecture
,
"
cry
I
,
"
that
your
mind
be
noble
;
but
now
I
find
it
so
.
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
my
dear
child
,
how
hast
thou
be
relieve
,
or
who
the
ruffian
be
who
carry
thee
away
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Sir
,
"
reply
she
,
"
as
to
the
villain
who
carry
me
off
,
I
be
yet
ignorant
.
<EOS>
for
as
my
mamma
and
I
be
walk
out
,
he
come
behind
us
,
and
almost
before
I
could
call
for
help
,
force
me
into
the
post
-
chaise
,
and
in
an
instant
the
horse
drive
away
.
<EOS>
I
meet
several
on
the
road
,
to
whom
I
cry
out
for
assistance
;
but
they
disregard
my
entreaty
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
the
ruffian
himself
use
every
art
to
hinder
me
from
cry
out
:
he
flatter
and
threaten
by
turn
,
and
swear
that
if
I
continue
but
silent
,
he
intend
no
harm
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
I
have
break
the
canvas
that
he
,
have
draw
up
,
and
whom
should
I
perceive
at
some
distance
but
your
old
friend
Mr
Burchell
,
walk
along
with
his
usual
swiftness
,
with
the
great
stick
for
which
we
use
so
much
to
ridicule
him
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
come
within
hearing
,
I
call
out
to
him
by
name
,
and
entreat
his
help
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
my
exclamation
several
time
,
upon
which
,
with
a
very
loud
voice
,
he
bid
the
postillion
stop
;
but
the
boy
take
no
notice
,
but
drive
on
with
still
great
speed
.
<EOS>
I
now
think
he
could
never
overtake
us
,
when
in
less
than
a
minute
I
see
Mr
Burchell
come
run
up
by
the
side
of
the
horse
,
and
with
one
blow
knock
the
postillion
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
the
horse
when
he
be
fall
soon
stopt
of
themselves
,
and
the
ruffian
step
out
,
with
oath
and
menace
draw
his
sword
,
and
order
him
at
his
peril
to
retire
;
but
Mr
Burchell
run
up
,
shiver
his
sword
to
piece
,
and
then
pursue
him
for
near
a
quarter
of
a
mile
;
but
he
make
his
escape
.
<EOS>
I
be
<EOS>
at
this
time
come
out
myself
,
willing
to
assist
my
deliverer
;
but
he
soon
return
to
me
in
triumph
.
<EOS>
the
postillion
,
who
be
recover
,
be
go
to
make
his
escape
too
;
but
Mr
Burchell
order
him
at
his
peril
to
mount
again
,
and
drive
back
to
town
.
<EOS>
find
it
impossible
to
resist
,
he
reluctantly
comply
,
though
the
wound
he
have
receive
seem
,
to
me
at
least
,
to
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
He
continue
to
complain
of
the
pain
as
we
drive
along
,
so
that
he
at
last
excited
<EOS>
Mr
Burchell
's
compassion
,
who
,
at
my
request
,
exchange
him
for
another
at
an
inn
where
we
call
on
our
return
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
welcome
then
<EOS>
,
"
cry
I
,
"
my
child
,
and
thou
her
gallant
deliverer

a
thousand
welcome

<EOS>
though
our
chear
be

wretched

yet
our
heart
be
ready

<EOS>
and
now
,
Mr
Burchell
,
as
you
have
deliver
my
girl
,
if
you
think
her
a
recompence
she
be
yours
,
if
you
can
stoop
to
an
alliance
with
a
family
so
poor
as
mine
,
take
her
,
obtain
her
consent
,
as
I
know
you
have
her
heart
,
and
you
have
mine
.
<EOS>
and
let
me
tell
you
,
Sir

that
I
give
you
no
small
treasure
,
she
have
be
celebrate
for
beauty
it
be
true

but
that
be
not
my
meaning

I
give
you
up
a
treasure
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
"
cry
Mr
Burchell
,
"
<EOS>
that
you
be
apprize
of
my
circumstance

of
my
incapacity

as
she
deserve

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
your
present
objection

"
reply
I
,
"
be
mean
as
an
evasion
of
my
offer

I
desist
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
no
man
so
worthy
to
deserve
her
as
you
;
and
if
I
could
give
her
thousand
,
and
thousand
seek
her
from
me
,
yet
my
honest

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
all
this
his
silence
alone
seem
to
give
a
mortifying
refusal
,
and
without
the
least
reply
to
my
offer
,
he
demand
if
we
could
not
be
furnish
with
refreshment
from
the
next
inn
,
to
which

answer
in
the
affirmative

to
send
in
the
good
dinner
that
could
be

upon
such
short
notice
.
<EOS>
He
bespeak
also
a
dozen
of
their
good
wine
;
and
some
cordial
for
me
.
<EOS>
add
,
with
a
smile
,
that
he
would
stretch
a
little
for
once
,
and
tho

in
a
prison
,
assert
he
be
never
better

<EOS>
My
daughter
have
not
yet
hear
of
her
poor
brother
's
melancholy
situation
,
and
we
all
seem
unwilling
to
damp
her
cheerfulness
by
the
relation
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
vain
that
I
attempt
to
appear
chearful
,
the
circumstance
of
my
unfortunate
son
break
through
all
effort
to
dissemble
;
so
that
I
be
at
last
oblige
to
damp
our
mirth
by
relate
his
misfortune
,
and
wish
that
he
may
be
permit
to
share
with
us
in
this
little
interval
of
satisfaction

<EOS>
after
my

from
the
consternation

I
request
also
that
Mr

a

may
be
admit
,
and
the
gaoler
grant
my
request
with
an
air
of
unusual
submission
.
<EOS>
the
clanking
of
my
son
's
iron
be
no
sooner
hear
along
the
passage
,
than
his
sister
run
impatiently
to
meet
him
;
while
Mr
Burchell
,
in
the
mean
time
,
ask
me
if
my
son
's
name
be
George
,
to
which
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
he
still
continue
silent
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
my
boy
enter
the
room
,
I
could
perceive
he
regard
Mr
Burchell
with
a
look
of
astonishment
and
reverence
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
My

this
while
regardless
of

He

and

<EOS>
never

I

any

<EOS>
the

a
certain
philosopher

with
adversity

<EOS>
after

"
I

<EOS>
You

give
you
a
right
to
take
that

but
where

be
the
difference
between
a
duelist
who
hazard
a
life
of
no
value

and
the
murderer
who
act
with
great
security
?
<EOS>
be
it
any
diminution
of
the

fraud
when

<EOS>
He
take
the

hastily
read
it
over
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
,

not
a
perfect
excuse

be
such
a
palliation

I

I

<EOS>
I

I

that
happiness
that

not

from
the
amusing

<EOS>
My

have
be
apprize

I
find

it
would
be
wrong
him

you
to
condemn
him
without
examination

if
there
be
injury

there
shall
be
redress

this
I
may
say
without

that
none

the
injustice

<EOS>
We

My

complicated

at

forgive
this

his

dangerously

even
though
my
uncle
himself
should
dissuade
me

which
I
know
he

I
will
see
public
justice

suffer
for
it

the

His

put
him
upon

him
the
cloath
he
now
wear
to
appear
like
a

furnish
him
with

the
plan
be
lay
between

that

should
carry
off
the
young
lady
to
a
place
of
safety

that
there
he
should
threaten

terrify
her

Mr

be
to
come
in
in
the
mean
time

as
if
by
accident
,
to
her
rescue
,
and
that
they
should
fight
awhile

then
he
be
to
run
off
,
by
which
Mr

would
have
the
well
opportunity

gain
her
affection

the
character

her
defender

the
coat

all
the
rest

confirm
by
a
more
circumstantial
account

concluding

that
Mr

have
often
declare

should
make

appearance

Miss
Arabella
Wilmot

who
be
next
day

marry

<EOS>
nothing
could
equal
her
surprize
at
see
Sir

his

here
before

for
her
arrival
be
quite
accidental
.
<EOS>
It
happen
that
she

the
old
gentleman
her
father
be
pass
through
the
town

on
their
way
to
her
aunt

have
insist

be
consummate
at

house

stop
for
refreshment

they
put
up
at
an
inn
at

other
end

town

<EOS>
It
be
there
from
the
window
that
the
young

happen
to
observe
one
of
my
little
boy
play
in
the
street

and
instantly
send
a
footman
to
bring
the
child
to
her

she
learn
from
him
some
account
of
our
misfortune
;

be
still
keep
ignorant
of
young
Mr

be
the
cause
.
<EOS>
though
her
father
make
several
remonstrance
on
the
impropriety
of
go
to
a
prison
to
visit
us
,
yet
they
be
ineffectual
;
she
desire
the
child
to
conduct
her
,
which
he
do
,

it
be
thus
she
surprise
us
at
a
juncture

unexpected

though

every

seldom
excite
our

upon

extraordinary
occasion

<EOS>
to
what
a
fortuitous
concurrence
do
we
not
owe
every
pleasure

how

seem
accident

We
all
continue
silent

She
then
proceed

this

to
inform
him
of

in

the

Squire
perceiving
that
he
be
on
every
side
undone

now
find
that
no

flattery

conclude
that

I
be
no

I
scorn

nothing

It

<EOS>
this
be
an
alarming
blow

Sir

sensible
of

be
instrumental

up

<EOS>
Miss

therefore
perceive
that

irretrievably

now
I
protest

your

<EOS>
Mr
Wilmot
now
enter
,
he
seem
not
a
little
pleased
at
the
danger
his
daughter
have
just
escape
,
and
readily
consent
to
a
dissolution
of
the
match

<EOS>
but
find
that
her
fortune
,
which
be
secure
to
Mr
Thornhill
by
bond
,
would
not
be
give
up
,
nothing
could
exceed
his
disappointment

<EOS>
He
now
see
that
his
money
must
all
go
to
enrich
one
who
have
no
fortune
of

<EOS>
He
could
bear
his
be
a
rascal
;
but
to
want
an
equivalent
to
his

fortune
be
wormwood

<EOS>
He
sate
therefore
for
some
minute
employ
in

most
mortifying
speculation

Sir

off

the

"
what

some
low
piece
of
humour
I
suppose
!

"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
Sir

"
reply
I
,
"
he
may
have
a
more
serious
meaning
.
<EOS>
for
when
we
reflect
on
the
various
scheme
this
gentleman
have
lay
to
seduce
innocence
,
perhaps
some
one
more
artful
than
the
rest
have
be
find
able
to
deceive
him
.
<EOS>
when
we
consider
what
number
he
have
ruin
,
how
many
parent
now
feel
with
anguish
the
infamy
and
the
contamination
which
he
have
bring
into
their
family
,
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
some
one
of
them
 
Amazement
!
<EOS>
do
I
see
my
lose
daughter

<EOS>
do
I
hold

it

my

thee

"
 
<EOS>
the
warm
transport
of
the
fond
lover
be
not
great
than
mine
when
I
see
him
introduce
my
child
,
and
hold
my
daughter
in
my
arm
,
whose
silence
only
speak
her
rapture

that
she

cry
Jenkinson

make
much
of
her

a

as
sure
as

nothing

truth

here
be
the
licence
by
which
you
be
marry
together

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
put
the
licence
into
the
Baronet
's
hand
,
who
read
it
,
and
find
it
perfect
in
every
respect
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
gentleman
,
"
continue
he
<EOS>
,
I
find
you
be
surprised
at
all
this
;
but
a
few
word
will
explain
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
that
there
"
Squire
of
renown
,
for
whom
I
have
a
great
friendship
,
but
that
be
between
ourselves
,
as
often
employ
me
in
do
odd
little
thing
for
him
.
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
he
commission
me
to
procure
him
a
false
licence
and
a
false
priest
,
in
order
to
deceive
this
young
lady
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
very
much
his
friend
,
what
do
I
do
but
go
and
get
a
true
licence
and
a
true
priest
,
and
marry
them
both
as
fast
as
the
cloth
could
make
them
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
think
it
be
generosity
that
make
me
do
all
this
.
<EOS>
but
no
.
<EOS>
to
my
shame
I
confess
it
,
my
only
design
be
to
keep
the
licence
and
let
the
"
Squire
know
that
I
could
prove
it
upon
him
whenever
I
think
proper
,
and
so
make
him
come
down
whenever
I
want
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
burst
of
pleasure
now
seem
to
fill
the
whole
apartment
;
our
joy
reach
even
to
the
common
room
,
where
the
prisoner
themselves
sympathize
,
      
and
shake
their
chain
  
in
transport
and
rude
harmony
.
  
<EOS>
happiness
be
expand
upon
every
face
,
and
even
Olivia
's
cheek
seem
flush
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
to
be
thus
restore
to
reputation
,
to
friend
and
fortune
at
once
,
be
a
rapture
sufficient
to
stop
the
progress
of
decay
and
restore
former
health
and
vivacity
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
among
all
there
be
not
one
who
feel
sincere
pleasure
than
I.
still
hold
the
dear
-
love
child
in
my
arm
<EOS>

I
ask
my
heart
if
these
transport
be
not
delusion

<EOS>
"
how
could
you
,
"
cry
I
,
turn
to
Mr
Jenkinson
,
"
how
could
you
add
to
my
misery
by
the
story
of
her
death
!
<EOS>
but
it
matter
not
,
my
pleasure
at
find
her
again
,
be
more
than
a
recompence
for
the
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
your
question
,
"
reply
Jenkinson
,
"
that
be
easily
answer

<EOS>
I
think
the
only
probable
mean
of
free
you
from
prison
,
be
by
submit
to
the
"
Squire
,
and
consent
to
his
marriage
with
the
other
young

<EOS>
but
these
you
have
vow
never
to
grant
while
your
daughter
be
live
,
there
be
therefore
no
other
method
to
bring
thing
to
bear
but
by
persuade
you
that
she
be
dead
.
<EOS>
I
prevail
on
your
wife
to
join
in
the
deceit
,

we
have
not
have
a
fit
opportunity
of
undeceive
you
till
now

<EOS>
in
the
whole
assembly
now
there
only
appear
two
face
that
do
not
glow
with
transport

<EOS>
Mr

's
assurance
have
entirely
forsake
him
:
he
now
see
the
gulph
of
infamy
and
want
before
him

and
tremble
to
take
the
plunge
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
fall
on
his
knee
before
his
uncle
,
and
in
a
voice
of
pierce
misery
implore
compassion
.

Sir

be
go
to
spurn
him
away

at
my
request
he
raise
him
,

after
pause
a
few
moment
,
"
thy

crime

only
remain
an
act
of
justice
for
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
be
sensible
,
Sir
,
"
continue
he
,
turn
to
me
,
"
of
the
obligation
we
both
owe
Mr
Jenkinson
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
<EOS>
but
just
we
should
both
reward
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
Miss
Sophia
will
,
I
be
sure
,
make
him
very
happy
,
and
he
shall
have
from
me
five
hundred
pound
as
her
fortune
,
and
upon
this
I
be
sure
they
can
live
very
comfortably
together
.
<EOS>
come
,
Miss
Sophia
<EOS>
,
what
say
you
to
this
match
of
my
making
?
<EOS>
Will
you
have
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
My
poor
girl
seem
almost
sink
into
her
mother
's
arm
at
the
hideous
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
him
,
Sir
!
"
cry
she
faintly
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
Sir
,
never
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
"
cry
he
again
,
"
not
have
Mr
Jenkinson
,
your
benefactor
,
a
handsome
young
fellow
,
with
five
hundred
pound
and
good
expectation
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
,
Sir
,
"
return
she
,
scarce
able
to
speak
,
"
that
you
will
desist
,
and
not
make
me
so
very
wretched

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
ever
such
obstinacy
know
,
"
cry
he
again
,
"
to
refuse
a
man
whom
the
family
have
such
infinite
obligation
to
,
who
have
preserve
your
sister
,
and
who
have
five
hundred
pound
!
<EOS>
what
not
have
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
Sir
,
never
,
"
reply
she
,
angrily
,
"
I
would
sooner
die
first
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
the
case
then
,
"
cry
he
,
"
if
you
will
not
have
him
 
I
think
I
must
have
you
myself
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
he
catch
her
to
his
breast
with
ardour
.
<EOS>
"
My
lovely
,
my
most
sensible
of
girl
,
"
cry
he
,
"
how
could
you
ever
think
your
own
Burchell
could
deceive
you
,
or
that
Sir
William
Thornhill
could
ever
cease
to
admire
a
mistress
that
love
him
for
himself
alone
?
<EOS>
I
have
for
some
year
seek
for
a
woman
,
who
a
stranger
to
my
fortune
could
think
that
I
have
merit
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
after
have
try
in
vain
,
even
amongst
the
pert
and
the
ugly
,
how
great
at
last
must
be
my
rapture
to
have
make
a
conquest
over
such
sense
and
such
heavenly
beauty
.
"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Jenkinson
,
"
as
I
can
not
,
Sir
,
part
with
this
young
lady
myself
,
for
she
have
take
a
fancy
to
the
cut
of
my
face
,
all
the
recompence
I
can
make
be
to
give
you
her
fortune
,
and
you
may
call
upon
my
steward
to
-
morrow
for
five
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
"
thus
we
have
all
our
compliment
to
repeat
,
and
Lady
Thornhill
undergo
the
same
round
of
ceremony
that
her
sister
have
do
before
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
Sir
William
's
gentleman
appear
to
tell
us
that
the
equipage
be
ready
to
carry
us
to
the
inn
,
where
every
thing
be
prepare
for
our
reception
.
<EOS>
My
wife
and
I
lead
the
van
,
and
leave
those
gloomy
mansion
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
the
generous
Baronet
order
forty
pound
to
be
distribute
among
the
prisoner
,
and
Mr
Wilmot
,
induce
by
his
example
,
give
half
that
sum
.
<EOS>
We
be
receive
below
by
the
shout
of
the
villager
,
and
I
see
and
shake
by
the
hand
two
or
three
of
my
honest
parishioner
,
who
be
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
They
attend
us
to
our
inn
,
where
a
sumptuous
entertainment
be
provide
,
and
coarser
provision
distribute
in
great
quantity
among
the
populace
.
  
<EOS>
after
supper
,
as
my
spirit
be
exhaust
by
the
alternation
of
pleasure
and
pain
which
they
have
sustain
during
the
day
,
I
ask
permission
to
withdraw
,
and
leave
the
company
in
the
midst
of
their
mirth
,
as
soon
as
I
find
myself
alone
,
I
pour
out
my
heart
in
gratitude
to
the
giver
of
joy
as
well
as
of
sorrow
,
and
then
sleep
undisturbed
till
morning
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
the
Conclusion
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
I
awake
I
find
my
eld
son
sit
by
my
bedside
,
who
come
to
encrease
my
joy
with
another
turn
of
fortune
in
my
favour
.
<EOS>
first
have
release
me
from
the
settlement
that
I
have
make
the
day
before
in
his
favour
,
he
let
me
know
that
my
merchant
who
have
fail
in
town
be
arrest
at
Antwerp
,
and
there
have
give
up
effect
to
a
much
great
amount
than
what
be
due
to
his
creditor
.
<EOS>
My
boy
's
generosity
please
me
almost
as
much
as
this
unlooke
for
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
some
doubt
whether
I
ought
in
justice
to
accept
his
offer
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
ponder
upon
this
,
Sir
William
enter
the
room
,
to
whom
I
communicate
my
doubt
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
be
,
that
as
my
son
be
already
possess
of
a
very
affluent
fortune
by
his
marriage
,
I
may
accept
his
offer
without
any
hesitation
.
<EOS>
His
business
,
however
,
be
to
inform
me
that
as
he
have
the
night
before
send
for
the
licence
,
and
expect
them
every
hour
,
he
hope
that
I
would
not
refuse
my
assistance
in
make
all
the
company
happy
that
morning
.
<EOS>
a
footman
enter
while
we
be
speak
,
to
tell
us
that
the
messenger
be
return
,
and
as
I
be
by
this
time
ready
,
I
go
down
,
where
I
find
the
whole
company
as
merry
as
affluence
and
innocence
could
make
them
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
they
be
now
prepare
for
a
very
solemn
ceremony
,
their
laughter
entirely
displease
me
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
of
the
grave
,
becoming
and
sublime
deportment
they
should
assume
upon
this
mystical
occasion
,
and
read
them
two
homily
and
a
thesis
of
my
own
composing
,
in
order
to
prepare
them
.
<EOS>
yet
they
still
seem
perfectly
refractory
and
ungovernable
.
<EOS>
even
as
we
be
go
along
to
church
,
to
which
I
lead
the
way
,
all
gravity
have
quite
forsake
them
,
and
I
be
often
tempt
to
turn
back
in
indignation
.
<EOS>
in
church
a
new
dilemma
arise
,
which
promise
no
easy
solution
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
which
couple
should
be
marry
first
;
my
son
's
bride
warmly
insist
,
that
Lady
Thornhill
,
(
that
be
to
be
)
should
take
the
lead
;
but
this
the
other
refuse
with
equal
ardour
,
protest
she
would
not
be
guilty
of
such
rudeness
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
argument
be
support
for
some
time
between
both
with
equal
obstinacy
and
good
breeding
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
stand
all
this
time
with
my
book
ready
,
I
be
at
last
quite
tired
of
the
contest
,
and
shut
it
,
"
I
perceive
,
"
cry
I
,
"
that
none
of
you
have
a
mind
to
be
married
,
and
I
think
we
have
as
good
go
back
again
;
for
I
suppose
there
will
be
no
business
do
here
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
at
once
reduce
them
to
reason
.
<EOS>
the
Baronet
and
his
Lady
be
first
married
,
and
then
my
son
and
his
lovely
partner
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
previously
that
morning
give
order
that
a
coach
should
be
send
for
my
honest
neighbour
Flamborough
and
his
family
,
by
which
mean
,
upon
our
return
to
the
inn
,
we
have
the
pleasure
of
find
the
two
Miss
Flamboroughs
alight
before
us
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jenkinson
give
his
hand
to
the
eld
,
and
my
son
Moses
lead
up
the
other
;
(
and
I
have
since
find
that
he
have
take
a
real
liking
to
the
girl
,
and
my
consent
and
bounty
he
shall
have
<EOS>
whenever
he
think
proper
to
demand
them
.
)
<EOS>
We
be
no
sooner
return
to
the
inn
,
but
number
of
my
parishioner
,
hearing
of
my
success
,
come
to
congratulate
me
,
but
among
the
rest
be
those
who
rise
to
rescue
me
,
and
whom
I
formerly
rebuke
with
such
sharpness
.
<EOS>
I
tell
the
story
to
Sir
William
,
my
son
-
in
-
law
,
who
go
out
and
reprove
them
with
great
severity
;
but
find
them
quite
dishearten
by
his
harsh
reproof
,
he
give
them
half
a
guinea
a
piece
to
drink
his
health
and
raise
their
dejected
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
this
we
be
call
to
a
very
genteel
entertainment
,
which
be
dr
by
Mr
Thornhill
's
cook
.
<EOS>
and
it
may
not
be
improper
to
observe
with
respect
to
that
gentleman
,
that
he
now
reside
in
quality
of
companion
at
a
relation
's
house
,
be
very
well
like
and
seldom
sit
at
the
side
-
table
,
except
when
there
be
no
room
at
the
other
;
for
they
make
no
stranger
of
him
.
<EOS>
His
time
be
pretty
much
take
up
in
keep
his
relation
,
who
be
a
little
melancholy
,
in
spirit
,
and
in
learn
to
blow
the
French-
horn
.
<EOS>
My
eld
daughter
,
however
,
still
remember
him
with
regret
;
and
she
have
even
tell
me
,
though
I
make
a
great
secret
of
it
,
that
when
he
reform
she
may
be
bring
to
relent
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
,
for
I
be
not
apt
to
digress
thus
,
when
we
be
to
sit
down
to
dinner
our
ceremony
be
go
to
be
renew
.
<EOS>
the
question
be
whether
my
eld
daughter
,
as
be
a
matron
,
should
not
sit
above
the
two
young
bride
,
but
the
debate
be
cut
short
by
my
son
George
,
who
propose
,
that
the
company
should
sit
indiscriminately
,
every
gentleman
by
his
lady
.
<EOS>
this
be
receive
with
great
approbation
by
all
,
except
my
wife
,
who
I
could
perceive
be
not
perfectly
satisfied
,
as
she
expect
to
have
have
the
pleasure
of
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
carve
all
the
meat
for
all
the
company
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
this
,
it
be
impossible
to
describe
our
good
humour
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
whether
we
have
more
wit
amongst
us
now
than
usual
;
but
I
be
certain
we
have
more
laugh
,
which
answer
the
end
as
well
.
<EOS>
one
jest
I
particularly
remember
,
old
Mr
Wilmot
drink
to
Moses
,
whose
head
be
turn
another
way
,
my
son
reply
,
"
Madam
,
I
thank
you
.
"
<EOS>
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
,
wink
upon
the
rest
of
the
company
,
observe
that
he
be
think
of
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
at
which
jest
I
think
the
two
miss
Flamboroughs
would
have
die
with
laughing
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
dinner
be
over
,
accord
to
my
old
custom
,
I
request
that
the
table
may
be
take
away
,
to
have
the
pleasure
of
see
all
my
family
assemble
once
more
by
a
chearful
fireside
.
<EOS>
My
two
little
one
sit
upon
each
knee
,
the
rest
of
the
company
by
their
partner
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
now
on
this
side
of
the
grave
to
wish
for
,
all
my
care
be
over
,
my
pleasure
be
unspeakable
.
<EOS>
It
now
only
remain
that
my
gratitude
in
good
fortune
should
exceed
my
former
submission
in
adversity
.
