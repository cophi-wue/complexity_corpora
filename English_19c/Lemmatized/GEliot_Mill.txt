Boy

outside
Dorlcote
Mill
  
<EOS>
a
wide
plain
,
where
the
broadening
Floss
hurry
on
between
its
green
bank
to
the
sea
,
and
the
loving
tide
,
rush
to
meet
it
<EOS>
,
check
its
passage
with
an
impetuous
embrace
.
<EOS>
on
this
mighty
tide
the
black
ship
 
laden
with
the
fresh
-
scent
fir
-
plank
,
with
rounded
sack
of
oil
-
bearing
seed
,
or
with
the
dark
glitter
of
coal
 
be
bear
along
to
the
town
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
which
show
its
aged
,
flute
red
roof
and
the
broad
gable
of
its
wharf
between
the
low
wooded
hill
and
the
river
-
brink
,
tinge
the
water
with
a
soft
purple
hue
under
the
transient
glance
of
this
February
sun
.
<EOS>
far
away
on
each
hand
stretch
the
rich
pasture
,
and
the
patch
of
dark
earth
make
ready
for
the
seed
of
broad
-
leaved
green
crop
,
or
touch
already
with
the
tint
of
the
tender
-
blade
autumn
-
sow
corn
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
remnant
still
of
last
year
's
golden
cluster
of
beehive
-
rick
rise
at
interval
beyond
the
hedgerow
;
and
everywhere
the
hedgerow
be
stud
with
tree
;
the
distant
ship
seem
to
be
lift
their
mast
and
stretch
their
red
-
brown
sail
close
among
the
branch
of
the
spread
ash
.
<EOS>
just
by
the
red
-
roof
town
the
tributary
Ripple
flow
with
a
lively
current
into
the
Floss
.
<EOS>
how
lovely
the
little
river
be
,
with
its
dark
change
wavelet
!
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
like
a
live
companion
while
I
wander
along
the
bank
,
and
listen
to
its
low
,
placid
voice
,
as
to
the
voice
of
one
who
be
deaf
and
loving
.
<EOS>
I
remember
those
large
dipping
willow
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
stone
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
I
must
stand
a
minute
or
two
here
on
the
bridge
and
look
at
it
,
though
the
cloud
be
threaten
,
and
it
be
far
on
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
even
in
this
leafless
time
of
depart
February
it
be
pleasant
to
look
at
,
 
perhaps
the
chill
,
damp
season
add
a
charm
to
the
trimly
keep
,
comfortable
dwelling
-
house
,
as
old
as
the
elm
and
chestnut
that
shelter
it
from
the
northern
blast
.
<EOS>
the
stream
be
brimful
now
,
and
lie
high
in
this
little
withy
plantation
,
and
half
drown
the
grassy
fringe
of
the
croft
in
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
as
I
look
at
the
full
stream
,
the
vivid
grass
,
the
delicate
bright
-
green
powder
soften
the
outline
of
the
great
trunk
and
branch
that
gleam
from
under
the
bare
purple
bough
,
I
be
in
love
with
moistness
,
and
envy
the
white
duck
that
be
dip
their
head
far
into
the
water
here
among
the
withe
,
unmindful
of
the
awkward
appearance
they
make
in
the
drier
world
above
.
  
<EOS>
the
rush
of
the
water
and
the
booming
of
the
mill
bring
a
dreamy
deafness
,
which
seem
to
heighten
the
peacefulness
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
They
be
like
a
great
curtain
of
sound
,
shut
one
out
from
the
world
beyond
.
<EOS>
and
now
there
be
the
thunder
of
the
huge
cover
wagon
come
home
with
sack
of
grain
.
<EOS>
that
honest
wagoner
be
think
of
his
dinner
,
get
sadly
dry
in
the
oven
at
this
late
hour
;
but
he
will
not
touch
it
till
he
have
feed
his
horse
,
 
the
strong
,
submissive
,
meek
-
eyed
beast
,
who
,
I
fancy
,
be
look
mild
reproach
at
him
from
between
their
blinker
,
that
he
should
crack
his
whip
at
them
in
that
awful
manner
as
if
they
need
that
hint
!
<EOS>
see
how
they
stretch
their
shoulder
up
the
slope
toward
the
bridge
,
with
all
the
more
energy
because
they
be
so
near
home
.
<EOS>
look
at
their
grand
shaggy
foot
that
seem
to
grasp
the
firm
earth
,
at
the
patient
strength
of
their
neck
,
bow
under
the
heavy
collar
,
at
the
mighty
muscle
of
their
struggle
haunch
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
well
to
hear
them
neigh
over
their
hardly
earn
feed
of
corn
,
and
see
them
,
with
their
moist
neck
free
from
the
harness
,
dip
their
eager
nostril
into
the
muddy
pond
.
<EOS>
now
they
be
on
the
bridge
,
and
down
they
go
again
at
a
swift
pace
,
and
the
arch
of
the
cover
wagon
disappear
at
the
turning
behind
the
tree
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
can
turn
my
eye
toward
the
mill
again
,
and
watch
the
unreste
wheel
send
out
its
diamond
jet
of
water
.
<EOS>
that
little
girl
be
watch
it
too
;
she
have
be
stand
on
just
the
same
spot
at
the
edge
of
the
water
ever
since
I
pause
on
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
and
that
queer
white
cur
with
the
brown
ear
seem
to
be
leap
and
bark
in
ineffectual
remonstrance
with
the
wheel
;
perhaps
he
be
jealous
because
his
playfellow
in
the
beaver
bonnet
be
so
rapt
in
its
movement
.
<EOS>
It
be
time
the
little
playfellow
go
in
,
I
think
;
and
there
be
a
very
bright
fire
to
tempt
her
:
the
red
light
shine
out
under
the
deepen
gray
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
It
be
time
,
too
,
for
me
to
leave
off
rest
my
arm
on
the
cold
stone
of
this
bridge
....
  
<EOS>
ah
,
my
arm
be
really
benumbed
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
press
my
elbow
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
,
and
dream
that
I
be
stand
on
the
bridge
in
front
of
Dorlcote
Mill
,
as
it
look
one
February
afternoon
many
year
ago
.
<EOS>
before
I
doze
off
,
I
be
go
to
tell
you
what
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
talk
about
,
as
they
sit
by
the
bright
fire
in
the
left
-
hand
parlor
,
on
that
very
afternoon
I
have
be
dream
of
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
of
Dorlcote
Mill
,
declare
His
resolution
about
Tom
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
want
,
you
know
,
"
say
Mr.
Tulliver
,
 
"
what
I
want
be
to
give
Tom
a
good
eddication
;
an
eddication
as'll
be
a
bread
to
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
be
think
of
when
I
give
notice
for
him
to
leave
the
academy
at
Lady
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
put
him
to
a
downright
good
school
at
Midsummer
.
<EOS>
the
two
year
at
th
'
academy
'
ud
ha
'
do
well
enough
,
if
I
would
mean
to
make
a
miller
and
farmer
of
him
,
for
he
be
have
a
fine
sight
more
schoolin
'
nor
_
I
_
ever
get
.
<EOS>
all
the
learnin
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
my
_
father
ever
pay
for
be
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
birch
at
one
end
and
the
alphabet
at
th
'
other
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
like
Tom
to
be
a
bit
of
a
scholard
,
so
as
he
may
be
up
to
the
trick
<EOS>
o
'
these
fellow
as
talk
fine
and
write
with
a
flourish
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
a
help
to
me
wi
'
these
lawsuit
,
and
arbitration
,
and
thing
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
make
a
downright
lawyer
o
'
<EOS>
the
lad
<EOS>
,
 
I
should
be
sorry
for
him
to
be
a
raskill
,
 
but
a
sort
o
'
engineer
,
or
a
surveyor
,
or
an
auctioneer
and
vallyer
,
like
Riley
,
or
one

them
smartish
business
as
be
all
profit
and
no
outlay
,
only
for
a
big
watch

chain
and
a
high
stool

<EOS>
They
be
pretty
nigh
all
one
,
and
they
be
not
far
off
be
even
wi

the
law
,

I
_
believe
;
for
Riley
look
Lawyer

to
his
wife

a
blond
comely
woman
in
a
fan

shape

(
I
be
afraid
to
think
how
long
it

since

they
must
be
so
near

forty
,
they

.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
you
know
best
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
have
_
no
objection

<EOS>
but
have
not
I
better
kill
a

o

fowl
,
and
have
th

to
dinner
next

so
as

may
hear
what

Glegg

<EOS>
there
be
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
kill
every
fowl
<EOS>
i
'
the
yard
<EOS>
if
you
like

Bessy
;
but
I
shall
ask
neither
aunt

what
I
be
to
do
wi

my
own
lad
,
"
say
Mr.
Tulliver
,
defiantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
heart
!
"
say
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
shock
at
this
sanguinary
rhetoric
,
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
talk
so
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
your
way
to
speak
disrespectful
o
'
my
family
;
and
sister
Glegg
throw
all
the
blame
upo
'
me
,
though
I
be
sure
I
be
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
.
<EOS>
for
nobody
be
ever
hear
me
say
as
it
be
not
lucky
for
my
child
to
have
aunt
and
uncle
as
can
live
independent
.
<EOS>
Howiver
,
if
Tom

to
go
to
a
new
school
,
I
should
like
him
to
go
where
I
can
wash
him
and
mend
him
;
else
he
may
as
well
have
calico
as
linen
,
for
they
would
be
one
as
yallow
as
th
'
other
before
they
would
be
wash
half
-
a

dozen
time
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
the
box
be
go
back'ard
and
forrard
,
I
could
send
the
lad
a
cake
,
or
a
pork

pie
,
or
an
apple
;
for
he
can
do
with
an
extry
bit
,
bless
him
!
<EOS>
whether
they
stint
him
at
the
meal
or
no

<EOS>
My

can
eat
as
much
victual
as
most

thank
God

we

the
carrier

cart
,
if
other
thing
fit
in

say
Mr.

but
you
must
not
put
a
speak

i

the
wheel
about

if

that
be
the
fault
I
have
to
find
wi

if
you

a
stick
i

you

you
can
not

You
would
want

Mrs.

when
do
I
iver
make
objection
to
a
man
because
he
would
get

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
be
rether
<EOS>
fond
o

for
my

,
as
be
dead
an

I
can
not
remember
your

Mr.

<EOS>
there

John

He
may

somewhere
out

how
be
I
to
know
that
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

no

Bessy
;
I
do
not

justly
the

I

niver
mind
 
<EOS>
it
be
puzzle
work

what
I

think
on

the
right

i

summat
else
besides
black
the

up

<EOS>
It
be
an
uncommon
puzzling
thing
to

<EOS>
Mr.

pause
a
minute
or
two
,
and
dive
with
both
hand
into
his
breech
pocket
as

there

apparently

have
suppose
that

draw
out
the
key
to

imagination
in
anticipate
the
moment
when
he
would
be
in
a
state
to
justify
the
production
of
the
good
Holland
sheet
.
<EOS>
happily
he
be
not
so
;
he
be
only
susceptible
in
respect
of
his
right
to
water
-
power
;
moreover
,
he
have
the
marital
habit
of
not
listen
very
closely
,
and
since
his
mention
of
Mr.
Riley
,
have
be
apparently
occupy
in
a
tactile
examination
of
his
woollen
stocking
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
hit
it
,
Bessy

"
be
his
first
remark
after
a
short
silence
.
<EOS>
"
Riley
's
as
likely
a
man
as
any
to
know
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
some
school
;
he
be
have
school
himself

that

we
shall
have
time
to
talk
it
over

<EOS>
I
want
Tom
to
be
such

as
Riley
,
you

as
can
talk
pretty

as
well

out
for
him

and
know
a
good

you
can
not

a

too

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mrs.

,
"
so
far
as
talk
proper

and
know
everything

and
walk
with
a
bend
in
his

set
his

up

I
should
not

the

up

<EOS>
but
them
fine

wear

they
wear
a

it

all
a
mess

and
then
hide
it
with
a

I
know
Riley
do

<EOS>
and
then
,
if
Tom
's
to
go

live
at
Mudport

like
Riley

he
will
have
a

"
no

"
say
Mr.

"
I
have
no

the

milk

when

they

keep

take

Mr.

a

rather
highly
educate

large

Mr.

<EOS>
the

have
come
to
a
pause
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
not
without
a
particular
reason
,
have
abstain
from
a
seventh
recital
of
the
cool
retort
by
which
Riley
have
show
himself
too
many
for
Dix
,
and
how
Wakem
have
have
his
comb
cut
for
once
in
his
life
,
now
the
business
of
the
dam
have
be
settle
by
arbitration
,
and
how
there
never
would
have
be
any
dispute
at
all
about
the
height
of
water
if
everybody
be
what
they
should
be
,
and
Old
Harry
have
not
make
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
be
,
on
the
whole
,
a
man
of
safe
traditional
opinion
;
but
on
one
or
two
point
he
have
trust
to
his
unassisted
intellect
,
and
have
arrive
at
several
questionable
conclusion
;
amongst
the
rest
,
that
rat
,
weevil
,
and
lawyer
be
create
by
Old
Harry
.
<EOS>
unhappily
he
have
no
one
to
tell
him
that
this
be
rampant
Manichæism
,
else
he
may
have
see
his
error
.
<EOS>
but
to
-
day
it
be
clear
that
the
good
principle
be
triumphant
:
this
affair
of
the
water
-
power
have
be
a
tangle
business
<EOS>
somehow
,
for
all
it
seem
 
look
at
it
one
way
 
as
plain
as
water
's
water
;
but
,
big
a
puzzle
as
it
be
,
it
have
not
get
the
well
of
Riley
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
take
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
a
little
strong
than
usual
,
and
,
for
a
man
who
may
be
suppose
to
have
a
few
hundred
lie
idle
at
his
banker
's
,
be
rather
incautiously
open
in
express
his
high
estimate
of
his
friend
's
business
talent
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
dam
be
a
subject
of
conversation
that
would
keep
;
it
could
always
be
take
up
again
at
the
same
point
,
and
exactly
in
the
same
condition
;
and
there
be
another
subject
,
as
you
know
,
on
which
Mr.
Tulliver
be
in
press
want
of
Mr.
Riley
's
advice
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
particular
reason
for
remain
silent
for
a
short
space
after
his
last
draught
,
and
rub
his
knee
in
a
meditative
manner
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
to
make
an
abrupt
transition
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
puzzling
world
,
as
he
often
say
,
and
if
you
drive
your
wagon
in
a
hurry
,
you
may
light
on
an
awkward
corner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
,
meanwhile
,
be
not
impatient
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
be
?
<EOS>
even
Hotspur
,
one
would
think
,
must
have
be
patient
in
his
slipper
on
a
warm
hearth
,
take
copious
snuff
,
and
sip
gratuitous
brandy

and

water
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
thing
I
have
get
i

"
say
Mr.
Tulliver
at
last
,
in
rather
a
low
tone
than
usual
,
as
he
turn
his
head
and
look
steadfastly
at
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Mr.
Riley
,
in
a
tone
of
mild
interest
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
with
heavy
waxen
eyelid
and
high
-
arched
eyebrow
,
look
exactly
the
same
under
all
circumstance
.
<EOS>
this
immovability
of
face
,
and
the
habit
of
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
before
he
give
an
answer
,
make
him
trebly
oracular
to
Mr.
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be

he
go

<EOS>
there
be
few
sound
that
rouse
Maggie
when

over
her
book

Tom

serve
as
well
as
the

whistle
;
in
an

she
be
on
the
watch
,
with
gleam
eye

like
a
Skye

suspect
mischief

at

determine
to

it
toward
Tom

"
You

I

I

you

Mr.

that

where
it

<EOS>
I
do
not

Tom
to

farmer
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
fun
<EOS>
i

that

<EOS>
why
,
if
I

him
a

he

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
evidently
a
point
on
which
Mr.
Tulliver
feel
strongly
;
and
the
impetus
which
have
give
unusual
rapidity
and
emphasis
to
his
speech
show
itself
still
unexhausted
for
some
minute
afterward
in
a
defiant
motion
of
the
head
from
side

and
an
occasional
"
Nay

"
like
a

growl

<EOS>
these
angry
symptom
be
keenly

by
Maggie

her
to
the

<EOS>
Tom
,
it
appear
,
be

capable
of
turn
his
father
out
of
door
,
and
of
make
the
future
in
some
way
tragic
by
his
wickedness
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
to
be
bear
;
and
Maggie
jump
up
from
her
stool
,
forget
all
about
her
heavy
book

which
fall
with
a
bang
within
the
fender

and
go
up
between
her
father

knee
,
say
,
in
a
half

cry
,
half

indignant
voice
,
    
"
Father

Mrs.

Mr.

heart
be
touch

so
Maggie
be
not

about

<EOS>
Mr.

quietly
pick
it
up

look
at
it
,
while
the

laugh

with
a
certain
tenderness
in
his
hard

pat
his

on

Mr.

look
at

then
,
in

low

turn
to
Mr.

as

could
not

She
understand
what

straight
off

and
allay
at

it

Mr.

add
sadly

it

here
the
exultation

clearly
recover
the

she
will
read

<EOS>
Maggie
's
cheek
begin
to
flush
with
triumphant
excitement
.
<EOS>
She
think
Mr.
Riley
would
have
a
respect
for
her
now
;
it
have
be
evident
that
he
think
nothing
of
her
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
be
turn
over
the
leave
of
the
book
,
and
she
could
make
nothing
of
his
face
,
with
its
high
-
arched
eyebrow
;
but
he
presently
look
at
her
,
and
say
,
    
"
come
,
come
and
tell
me
something
about
this
book

here
be
some
picture

I

<EOS>
Maggie
,
with
deepen
color
,
go
without
hesitation
to
Mr.

's
elbow
and
look
over
the
book
,
eagerly
seize
one
corner
,
and
toss
back
her
mane
,
while
she
say
,
    
"
oh
,
I
will
tell
you
what
that
mean
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
picture
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
help
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
that
old
woman
in
the
water
's
a
witch
,
 
they
have
put
her
in
to
find
out
whether
she
be
a
witch
or
no
;
and
if
she
swim
<EOS>
she
be
a
witch
,
and
if
she
be
drown
 
and
kill
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
she
be
innocent
,
and
not
a
witch
,
but
only
a
poor
silly
old
woman
.
<EOS>
but
what
good
would
it
do
her
then
,
you
know
,
when
she
be
drown
?
<EOS>
only
,
I
suppose
,
she
would
go
to
heaven
,
and
God
would
make
it
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
this
dreadful
blacksmith
with
his
arm
akimbo
,
laugh
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
be
not
he
ugly
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
he
be
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
Devil
_
<EOS>
really
_
"
(
here
Maggie
's
voice
become
loud
and
more
emphatic
)
,
"
and
not
a
right
blacksmith
;
for
the
Devil
take
the
shape
of
wicked
man
,
and
walk
about
and
set
people
do
wicked
thing
,
and
he
be
oftener
in
the
shape
of
a
bad
man
than
any
other
,
because
,
you
know
,
if
people
see
he
be
the
Devil
,
and
he
roar
at
'em
,
they
would
run
away
,
and
he
could
not
make
'em
do
what
he
please
.

<EOS>
Mr.

have
listen
to
this
exposition
of
Maggie

with
petrifying
wonder

<EOS>
"
why

what

the

have
get
hold
on

he
burst
out
at
last

<EOS>
"
the
"

Mr.

<EOS>
"
how
come

Mr.

<EOS>
Maggie
look

(
Mr.

somehow
a
familiarity

there
be
a
lot
more
of

sermon
mostly
,
I
think
,
 
<EOS>

they
have
all
get
the

I
think
they
be
all
o

one
sample

as
you
may
say

it
seem
one
must
not

by
th

this

"

say
Mr.

,
in

Maggie
on

you
to

the
variety
of
her
reading

<EOS>

I
know
the
reading
in

I

story
to
the

triumphantly

<EOS>
I
will
show
you
the
picture

Maggie
run
in
an
instant
to
the
corner
of
the
room

jump
on
a
chair
,
and
reach
down
from
the

a

the

all
black

to

definite
advantage

himself
,
notwithstanding
the
subtle
indication
to
the
contrary
which
may
have
mislead
a

sagacious
observer

<EOS>
for
there
be
nothing
more
widely
misleading
than
sagacity
if
it
happen
to
get
on
a
wrong
scent
;
and
sagacity

speak
from
distinct
motive

with
a
consciously
propose
end

,
be
certain
to

imaginary

<EOS>
plot
covetousness
and
deliberate
contrivance
,
in
order
to
compass
a
selfish
end
,
be
nowhere
abundant
but
in
the
world
of
the
dramatist
:
they
demand
too
intense
a
mental
action
for
many
of
our
fellow
-
parishioner
to
be
guilty
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
enough
to
spoil
the
life
of
our
neighbor
without
take
so
much
trouble
;
we
can
do
it
by
lazy
acquiescence
and
lazy
omission
,
by
trivial
falsity
for
which
we
hardly
know
a
reason
,
by
small
fraud
neutralize
by
small
extravagance
,
by
maladroit
flattery
,
and
clumsily
improvised
insinuation
.
<EOS>
We
live
from
hand
to
mouth
,
most
of
us
,
with
a
small
family
of
immediate
desire
;
we
do
little
else
than
snatch
a
morsel
to
satisfy
the
hungry
brood
,
rarely
think
of
seed

corn
or
the
next

crop

<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
be
a
man
of
business
,
and
not
cold
toward
his
own
interest
,
yet
even
he
be
more
under
the
influence
of
small
prompting
than
of
far
-
sighted
design
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
private
understanding
with
the
Rev.
Walter
stelle
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
know
very
little
of
that
M.A.
and
his
acquirement
,
 
not
quite
enough
,
perhaps
,
to
warrant
so
strong
a
recommendation
of
him
as
he
have
give
to
his
friend
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
but
he
believe
Mr.
stelle
to
be
an
excellent
classic
,
for
Gadsby
have
say
so
,
and
Gadsby
's
first
cousin
be
an
Oxford
tutor
;
which
be
well
ground
for
the
belief
even
than
his
own
immediate
observation
would
have
be
,
for
though
Mr.
Riley
have
receive
a
tincture
of
the
classic
at
the
great
Mudport
Free
School
,
and
have
a
sense
of
understand
Latin
generally
,
his
comprehension
of
any
particular
Latin
be
not
ready
.
<EOS>
doubtless
there
remain
a
subtle
aroma
from
his
juvenile
contact
with
the
"
De
Senectute
"
and
the
fourth
book
of
the
"
Æneid
,
"
but
it
have
cease
to
be
distinctly
recognizable
as
classical
,
and
be
only
perceive
in
the
high
finish
and
force
of
his
auctioneering
style
.
<EOS>
then
,
Stelling
be
an
Oxford
man
,
and
the
Oxford
man
be
always
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
it
be
the
Cambridge
man
who
be
always
good
mathematician
.
<EOS>
but
a
man
who
have
have
a
university
education
could
teach
anything
he
like
;
especially
a
man
like
Stelling
,
who
have
make
a
speech
at
a
Mudport
dinner
on
a
political
occasion
,
and
have
acquit
himself
so
well
that
it
be
generally
remark
,
this
son
-
in
-
law
of
Timpson
's
be
a
sharp
fellow
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
expect
of
a
Mudport
man
,
from
the
parish
of
St.
Ursula
,
that
he
would
not
omit
to
do
a
good
turn
to
a
son
-
in
-
law
of
Timpson
's
,
for
Timpson
be
one
of
the
most
useful
and
influential
man
in
the
parish
,
and
have
a
good
deal
of
business
,
which
he
know
how
to
put
into
the
right
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riley
like
such
man
,
quite
apart
from
any
money
which
may
be
divert
,
through
their
good
judgment
,
from
less
worthy
pocket
into
his
own
;
and
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
him
to
say
to
Timpson
on
his
return
home
,
"
I
have
secure
a
good
pupil
for
your
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
Timpson
have
a
large
family
of
daughter
;
Mr.
Riley
feel
for
him
;
besides
,
Louisa
Timpson
's
face
,
with
its
light
curl
,
have
be
a
familiar
object
to
him
over
the
pew
wainscot
on
a
Sunday
for
nearly
fifteen
year
;
it
be
natural
her
husband
should
be
a
commendable
tutor
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Mr.
Riley
know
of
no
other
schoolmaster
whom
he
have
any
ground
for
recommend
in
preference
;
why
,
then
,
should
he
not
recommend
stelle
?
<EOS>
His
friend
Tulliver
have
ask
him
for
an
opinion
;
it
be
always
chill
,
in
friendly
intercourse
,
to
say
you
have
no
opinion
to
give
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
deliver
an
opinion
at
all
,
it
be
mere
stupidity
not
to
do
it
with
an
air
of
conviction
and
well
-
found
knowledge
.
<EOS>
You
make
it
your
own
in
utter
it
,
and
naturally
get
fond
of
it
.
<EOS>
thus
Mr.
Riley
,
know
no
harm
of
stelle
to
begin
with
,
and
wish
him
well
,
so
far
as
he
have
any
wish
at
all
concern
him
,
have
no
sooner
recommend
him
than
he
begin
to
think
with
admiration
of
a
man
recommend
on
such
high
authority
,
and
would
soon
have
gather
so
warm
an
interest
on
the
subject
,
that
if
Mr.
Tulliver
have
in
the
end
decline
to
send
Tom
to
Stelling
,
Mr.
Riley
would
have
think
his
"
friend
of
the
old
school
"
a
thoroughly
pig
-
head
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
blame
Mr.
Riley
very
severely
for
give
a
recommendation
on
such
slight
ground
,
I
must
say
you
be
rather
hard
upon
him
.
<EOS>
why
should
an
auctioneer
and
appraiser
thirty
year
ago
,
who
have
as
good
as
forget
his
free
-
school
Latin
,
be
expect
to
manifest
a
delicate
scrupulosity
which
be
not
always
exhibit
by
gentleman
of
the
learned
profession
,
even
in
our
present
advanced
stage
of
morality
?
  
<EOS>
besides
,
a
man
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
him
can
scarcely
abstain
from
do
a
good
-
natured
action
,
and
one
can
not
be
good
-
natured
all
round
.
<EOS>
nature
herself
occasionally
quarter
an
inconvenient
parasite
on
an
animal
toward
whom
she
have
otherwise
no
ill
will
.
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
We
admire
her
care
for
the
parasite
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Riley
have
shrink
from
give
a
recommendation
that
be
not
base
on
valid
evidence
,
he
would
not
have
help
Mr.
stelle
to
a
pay
pupil
,
and
that
would
not
have
be
so
well
for
the
reverend
gentleman
.
<EOS>
consider
,
too
,
that
all
the
pleasant
little
dim
idea
and
complacency
 
of
stand
well
with
Timpson
,
of
dispense
advice
when
he
be
ask
for
it
,
of
impress
his
friend
Tulliver
with
additional
respect
,
of
say
something
,
and
say
it
emphatically
,
with
other
inappreciably
minute
ingredient
that
go
along
with
the
warm
hearth
and
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
to
make
up
Mr.
Riley
's
consciousness
on
this
occasion
 
would
have
be
a
mere
blank
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
be
expect
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
heavy
disappointment
to
Maggie
that
she
be
not
allow
to
go
with
her
father
in
the
gig
when
he
go
to
fetch
Tom
home
from
the
academy
;
but
the
morning
be
too
wet
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
say
,
for
a
little
girl
to
go
out
in
her
good
bonnet
.
<EOS>
Maggie
take
the
opposite
view
very
strongly
,
and
it
be
a
direct
consequence
of
this
difference
of
opinion
<EOS>
that
when
her
mother
be
in
the
act
of
brush
out
the
reluctant
black
crop
Maggie
suddenly
rush
from
under
her
hand
and
dip
her
head
in
a
basin
of
water
stand
near
,
in
the
vindictive
determination
that
there
should
be
no
more
chance
of
curl
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
Maggie
!
"
exclaim
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
sit
stout
and
helpless
with
the
brush
on
her
lap
,
"
what
be
to
become
of
you
if
you
be
so
naughty
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
your
aunt
Glegg
and
your
aunt
Pullet
when
they
come
next
week
,
and
they
will
never
love
you
any
more

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
oh

look
at
your

wet

a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
before
this
remonstrance
be
finish
,
Maggie
be
already
out
of
hearing
,
make
her
way
toward
the
great
attic
that
run
under
the
old
high
-
pitch
roof
,
shake
the
water
from
her
black
lock
as
she
run
,
like
a
Skye
terrier
escape
from
his
bath

<EOS>
this
attic
be
Maggie
's
favorite
retreat
on
a
wet
day
,
when
the
weather
be
not
too
cold
;
here
she
fret
out
all
her
ill
humor
,
and
talk
aloud
to
the
worm
-
eat
floor
and
the
worm
-
eat
shelf
,
and
the
dark
rafter
festoon
with
cobwebs
;
and
here
she
keep
a
Fetish
which
she
punish
for
all
her
misfortune
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
trunk
of
a
large
wooden
doll
,
which
once
stare
with
the
round
of
eye
above
the
red
of
cheek
;
but
be
now
entirely
deface
by
a
long
career
of
vicarious
suffering
.
<EOS>
three
nail
drive
into
the
head
commemorate
as
many
crisis
in
Maggie
's
nine
year
of
earthly
struggle
;
that
luxury
of
vengeance
have
be
suggest
to
her
by
the
picture
of
Jael
destroy
Sisera
in
the
old
Bible
.
<EOS>
the
last
nail
have
be
drive
in
with
a
fiercer
stroke
than
usual
,
for
the
Fetish
on
that
occasion
represent
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
but
immediately
afterward
Maggie
have
reflect
that
if
she
drive
many
nail
in
she
would
not
be
so
well
able
to
fancy
that
the
head
be
hurt
when
she
knock
it
against
the
wall
,
nor
to
comfort
it
,
and
make
believe
to
poultice
it
,
when
her
fury
be
abate
;
for
even
aunt
Glegg
would
be
pitiable
when
she
have
be
hurt
very
much
,
and
thoroughly
humiliate
,
so
as
to
beg
her
niece
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
since
then
she
have
drive
no
more
nail
in
,
but
have
soothe
herself
by
alternately
grind
and
beat
the
wooden
head
against
the
rough
brick
of
the
great
chimney
that
make
two
square
pillar
support
the
roof
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
she
do
this
morning
on
reach
the
attic
,
sob
all
the
while
with
a
passion
that
expel
every
other
form
of
consciousness
,
 
even
the
memory
of
the
grievance
that
have
cause
it
.
<EOS>
as
at
last
the
sobs
be
get
quieter
,
and
the
grind
less
fierce
,
a
sudden
beam
of
sunshine
,
fall
through
the
wire
lattice
across
the
worm
-
eat
shelf
,
make
her
throw
away
the
Fetish
and
run
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
really
break
out
;
the
sound
of
the
mill
seem
cheerful
again
;
the
granary
door
be
open
;
and
there
be
Yap
,
the
queer
white

and
-
brown
terrier
,
with
one
ear
turn
back
,
trot
about
and
sniff
vaguely
,
as
if
he
be
in
search
of
a
companion

<EOS>
It
be
irresistible

<EOS>
Maggie
toss
her
hair
back
and
run
downstairs
,
seize
her
bonnet
without
put
it
on
,
peep
,
and
then
dash
along
the
passage
lest
she
should
encounter
her
mother
,
and
be
quickly
out
in
the
yard
,
whirl
round
like
a

and
singe

<EOS>
Maggie
love
to
linger
in
the
great
space
of
the
mill
,
and
often
come
out
with
her
black
hair
powder
to
a
soft
whiteness
that
make
her
dark
eye
flash
out
with
new
fire

<EOS>
the
resolute
din
,
the
unreste
motion
of
the
great
stone

give
her
a
dim
,
delicious
awe
as
at
the
presence
of
an
uncontrollable
force
;
the
meal
forever
pour
,
pour
;
the
fine
white
powder
soften
all
surface
,
and
make
the
very
spidernet
look
like
a
faery
lace

work
;
the
sweet
,
pure
scent
of
the
meal
,
 
all
help
to
make
Maggie
feel
that
the
mill
be
a
little
world
apart
from
her
outside
every

day
life
.
<EOS>
the
spider
be
especially
a
subject
of
speculation
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
if
they
have
any
relative
outside
the
mill
,
for
in
that
case
there
must
be
a
painful
difficulty
in
their
family
intercourse
,
 
a
fat
and
floury
spider
,
accustom
to
take
his
fly
well
dust
with
meal
,
must
suffer
a
little
at
a
cousin

table
where
the
fly
be
<EOS>
_
au

_
,
and
<EOS>
the
lady
spider
must
be
mutually
shocked
at
each
other
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
but
the
part
of
the
mill
she
like
best
be
the
topmost
story
,
 
the
corn
-
hutch
,
where
there
be
the
great
heap
of
grain
,
which
she
could
sit
on
and
slide
down
continually
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
the
habit
of
take
this
recreation
as
she
converse
with
Luke
,
to
whom
she
be
very
communicative
,
wish
him
to
think
well
of
her
understanding
,
as
her
father
do
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
she
feel
it
necessary
to
recover
her
position
with
him
on
the
present
occasion
for
,
as
she
sit
slide
on
the
heap
of
grain
near
which
he
be
busy
himself
,
she
say
,
at
that
shrill
pitch
which
be
requisite
in

"

I

there

the

weight

leave
on

mind
cause
her
to
feel
more
than

the
career

when
she
look
at
the
picture

he
lean
against
a
tree
with
a
flaccid
appearance

his
knee

breech
unbuttoned

his
wig
awry

while
the
swine
apparently
of

seem
to
insult
him
by
their
good
spirit
over
their
feast
of
husk

when

enough

the

jump
first
on

then
on
the

;
while
Tom
descend
from
the
gig
,

say
,
with
masculine
reticence
as
to
the
tender
emotion
,
"

<EOS>
nevertheless
he
submit
to
be
kiss
willingly
enough
,
though
Maggie
hang
on
his
neck
in
rather
a
strangling
fashion
,
while
his
blue
-
gray
eye
wander
toward
the
croft
and
the
lamb
and
the
river
,
where
he
promise
himself
that
he
would
begin
to
fish
the
first
thing
to

morrow
morning

<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
lad
that
grow
everywhere
in
England
,
and
at
twelve
or
thirteen
year
of
age
look
as
much
alike
as
gosling
,
 
a
lad
with
light
-
brown
hair
,
cheek
of
cream
and
rose
,
full
lip
,
indeterminate
nose
and
eyebrow
,
 
a
physiognomy
in
which
it
seem
impossible
to
discern
anything
but
the
generic
character
to
boyhood
;
as
different
as
possible
from
poor
Maggie
's
phiz
,
which
Nature
seem
to
have
mould
and
color
with
the
most
decide
intention
.
<EOS>
but
that
same
Nature
have
the
deep
cunning
which
hide
itself
under
the
appearance
of
openness
,
so
that
simple
people
think
they
can
see
through
her
quite
well
,
and
all
the
while
she
be
secretly
prepare
a
refutation
of
their
confident
prophecy

<EOS>
under
these
average
boyish
physiognomy
that
she
seem
to
turn
off
by
the
gross
,
she
conceal
some
of
her
most
rigid
,
inflexible
purpose
,
some
of
her
most
unmodifiable
character
;
and
the
dark
-
eyed
,
demonstrative
,
rebellious
girl
may
after
all
turn
out
to
be
a
passive
being
compare
with
this
pink
-
and
-
white
bit
of
masculinity
with
the
indeterminate
feature

into

corner

out
to
examine
his
box

have
take
off

up

I

you
be
like
Samson

<EOS>
if
there

a
lion
roar
at
me
,
I
think
you
would
fight
him
,
would
not
you

Tom

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
a
lion
come
roar
at
you
,
you
silly
thing
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
lion
,
only
in
the
show
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
if
we
be
in
the
lion
country
 
<EOS>
I
mean
in
Africa
,
where
it
be
very
hot
;
the
lion
eat
people
there
.
<EOS>
I
can
show
it
you
in
the
book
where
I
read
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
should
get
a
gun
and
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
have
not
get
a
gun
,
 
we
may
have
go
out
,
you
know
,
not
think
,
just
as
we
go
fish
;
and
then
a
great
lion
may
run
toward
us
roar
,
and
we
could
not
get
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
what
should
you
do
,
Tom

"
  
<EOS>
Tom
pause
,
and
at
last
turn
away
contemptuously
,
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
the
lion

be
not

come
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of

?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

like
to
fancy
how
it
would
be

follow
him

<EOS>
just

what
you
would

<EOS>
Maggie

She

not
tell
the
sad
truth
at
once
,
but
she
walk
after
Tom
in
tremble
silence
as
he
go
out

think
how
she
could
tell
him
the
news
so
as
to
soften
at
once
his
sorrow
and
his
anger
;
for
Maggie
dread
Tom

it

timidly
,
when

"
  
<EOS>
with
this
terrible
conclusion
,
Tom
run
away
from
Maggie
toward
the
mill
,
mean
to
greet
Luke
there
,
and
complain
to
him
of
Harry
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
stand
motionless
,
except
from
her
sobs
,
for
a
minute
or
two
;
then
she
turn
round
and
run
into
the
house
,
and
up
to
her
attic
,
where
she
sit
on
the
floor
and
lay
her
head
against
the
worm
-
eat
shelf
,
with
a
crush
sense
of
misery
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
come
home
,
and
she
have
think
how
happy
she
should
be
;
and
now
he
be
cruel
to
her
.
<EOS>
what
use
be
anything
if
Tom
do
not
love
her

<EOS>
oh
,
he
be
very
cruel
!
<EOS>
have
not
she
want
to
give
him
the
money
,
and
say
how
very
sorry
she
be
?
<EOS>
She
know
she
be
naughty
to
her
mother
,
but
she
have
never
be
naughty
to
Tom
 
have
never
_
mean
_
to
be
naughty
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
be
cruel
!
"
<EOS>
Maggie
sob
aloud
,
find
a
wretched
pleasure
in
the
hollow
resonance
that
come
through
the
long
empty
space
of
the
attic
.
<EOS>
She
never
think
of
beat
or
grind
her
Fetish
;
she
be
too
miserable
to
be
angry
.
  
<EOS>
these
bitter
sorrow
of
childhood
!
<EOS>
when
sorrow
be
all
new
and
strange
,
when
hope
have
not
yet
get
wing
to
fly
beyond
the
day
and
week
,
and
the
space
from
summer
to
summer
seem
measureless
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
soon
think
she
have
be
hour
in
the
attic
,
and
it
must
be
tea
-
time
,
and
they
be
all
have
their
tea
,
and
not
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
she
would
stay
up
there
and
starve
herself
,
 
hide
herself
behind
the
tub
,
and
stay
there
all
night
,
 
and
then
they
would
all
be
frightened
,
and
Tom
would
be
sorry
.
<EOS>
thus
Maggie
think
in
the
pride
of
her
heart
,
as
she
creep
behind
the
tub
;
but
presently
she
begin
to
cry
again
at
the
idea
that
they
do
not
mind
her
be
there
.
<EOS>
if
she
go
down
again
to
Tom
now
 
would
he
forgive
her
?
<EOS>
perhaps
her
father
would
be
there
,
and
he
would
take
her
part
.
<EOS>
but
then
she
want
Tom
to
forgive
her
because
he
love
her
,
not
because
his
father
tell
him
.
<EOS>
no
,
she
would
never
go
down
if
Tom
do
not
come
to
fetch
her
.
<EOS>
this
resolution
last
in
great
intensity
for
five
dark
minute
behind
the
tub
;
but
then
the
need
of
be
love
 
the
strong
need
in
poor
Maggie
's
nature
 
begin
to
wrestle
with
her
pride
,
and
soon
throw
it
.
<EOS>
She
creep
from
behind
her
tub
into
the
twilight
of
the
long
attic
,
but
just
then
she
hear
a
quick
foot
-
step
on
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
have
be
too
much
interested
in
his
talk
with
Luke
,
in
go
the
round
of
the
premise
,
walk
in
and
out
where
he
please
,
and
whittle
stick
without
any
particular
reason
,
 
except
that
he
do
not
whittle
stick
at
school
,
 
to
think
of
Maggie
and
the
effect
his
anger
have
produce
on
her
.
<EOS>
He
mean
to
punish
her
,
and
that
business
have
be
perform
,
he
occupy
himself
with
other
matter
,
like
a
practical
person
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
be
call
in
to
tea
,
his
father
say
,
"
why
,
where
be
the
little
wench
?
"
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
almost
at
the
same
moment
,
say
,
"
where
be
your
little
sister
?
<EOS>
"
 
both
of
them
have
suppose
that
Maggie
and
Tom
have
be
together
all
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
want
to
"
tell
"
of
Maggie
,
though
he
be
angry
with
her
;
for
Tom
Tulliver
be
a
lad
of
honor
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
have
not
she
be
play
with
you
all
this
while
?
"
say
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
be
think
o
'
nothing
but
your
come
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
see
her
this
two
hour
,
"
say
Tom
,
commence
on
the
plumcake
.
  
<EOS>
"
goodness
heart
;
she
be
get
drownde
!
"
exclaim
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
rise
from
her
seat
and
run
to
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
could
you
let
her
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
she
add
,
as
become
a
fearful
woman
,
accuse
she
do
not
know
whom
of
she
do
not
know
what
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
she
be
none
drownde
,
"
say
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
naughty
to
her
,
I
doubt
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
have
not
,
father
,
"
say
Tom
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
perhaps
up
in
that
attic
,
"
say
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
a
-
singing
and
talk
to
herself
,
and
forget
all
about
meal
-
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
go
and
fetch
her
down
,
Tom
,
"
say
Mr.
Tulliver
,
rather
sharply
,
 
his
perspicacity
or
his
fatherly
fondness
for
Maggie
make
him
suspect
that
the
lad
have
be
hard
upon
"
the
little
un
,
"
else
she
would
never
have
leave
his
side
.
"
<EOS>
and
be
good
to
her
,
do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
else
I
will
let
you
know
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
never
disobey
his
father
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
be
a
peremptory
man
,
and
,
as
he
say
,
would
never
let
anybody
get
hold
of
his
whip
-
hand
;
but
he
go
out
rather
sullenly
,
carry
his
piece
of
plumcake
,
and
not
intend
to
reprieve
Maggie
's
punishment
,
which
be
no
more
than
she
deserve
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
only
thirteen
,
and
have
no
decide
view
in
grammar
and
arithmetic
,
regard
them
for
the
most
part
as
open
question
,
but
he
be
particularly
clear
and
positive
on
one
point
,
 
namely
,
that
he
would
punish
everybody
who
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
why
,
he
would
not
have
mind
be
punish
himself
if
he
deserve
it
;
but
,
then
,
he
never
_
do
_
deserve
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Tom
's
step
,
then
,
that
Maggie
hear
on
the
stair
,
when
her
need
of
love
have
triumph
over
her
pride
,
and
she
be
go
down
with
her
swollen
eye
and
dishevelled
hair
to
beg
for
pity
.
<EOS>
at
least
her
father
would
stroke
her
head
and
say
,
"
never
mind
,
my
wench
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
wonderful
subduer
,
this
need
of
love
,
 
this
hunger
of
the
heart
,
 
as
peremptory
as
that
other
hunger
by
which
Nature
force
us
to
submit
to
the
yoke
,
and
change
the
face
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
know
Tom
's
step
,
and
her
heart
begin
to
beat
violently
with
the
sudden
shock
of
hope
.
<EOS>
He
only
stand
still
at
the
top
of
the
stair
and
say
,
"
Maggie
,
you
be
to
come
down
.
"
<EOS>
but
she
rush
to
him
and
cling
round
his
neck
,
sob
,
"
oh
,
Tom
,
please
forgive
me
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it
 
<EOS>
I
will
always
be
good
 
<EOS>
always
remember
thing
 
<EOS>
do
love
me
 
please
,
dear
Tom
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
learn
to
restrain
ourselves
as
we
get
old
.
<EOS>
We
keep
apart
when
we
have
quarrel
,
express
ourselves
in
well
-
breed
phrase
,
and
in
this
way
preserve
a
dignified
alienation
,
show
much
firmness
on
one
side
,
and
swallow
much
grief
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
no
longer
approximate
in
our
behavior
to
the
mere
impulsiveness
of
the
low
animal
,
but
conduct
ourselves
in
every
respect
like
member
of
a
highly
civilized
society
.
<EOS>
Maggie
and
Tom
be
still
very
much
like
young
animal
,
and
so
she
could
rub
her
cheek
against
his
,
and
kiss
his
ear
in
a
random
sobbing
way
;
and
there
be
tender
fibre
in
the
lad
that
have
be
use
to
answer
to
Maggie
's
fondling
,
so
that
he
behave
with
a
weakness
quite
inconsistent
with
his
resolution
to
punish
her
as
much
as
she
deserve
.
<EOS>
He
actually
begin
to
kiss
her
in
return
,
and
say
,
    
"
do
not
cry
,
then
,
Magsie
;
here
,
eat
a
bit
o
'
cake
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
sobs
begin
to
subside
,
and
she
put
out
her
mouth
for
the
cake
and
bite
a
piece
;
and
then
Tom
bite
a
piece
,
just
for
company
,
and
they
eat
together
and
rub
each
other
's
cheek
and
brow
and
nose
together
,
while
they
eat
,
with
a
humiliating
resemblance
to
two
friendly
pony
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
along
,
Magsie
,
and
have
tea
,
"
say
Tom
at
last
,
when
there
be
no
more
cake
except
what
be
down
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
so
end
the
sorrow
of
this
day
,
and
the
next
morning
Maggie
be
trot
with
her
own
fishing
-
rod
in
one
hand
and
a
handle
of
the
basket
in
the
other
,
step
always
,
by
a
peculiar
gift
,
in
the
muddy
place
,
and
look
darkly
radiant
from
under
her
beaver
-
bonnet
because
Tom
be
good
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
Tom
,
however
,
that
she
should
like
him
to
put
the
worm
on
the
hook
for
her
,
although
she
accept
his
word
when
he
assure
her
that
worm
could
not
feel
(
it
be
Tom
's
private
opinion
that
it
do
not
much
matter
if
they
do
)
.
<EOS>
He
know
all
about
worm
,
and
fish
,
and
those
thing
;
and
what
bird
be
mischievous
,
and
how
padlock
open
,
and
which
way
the
handle
of
the
gate
be
to
be
lift
.
<EOS>
Maggie
think
this
sort
of
knowledge
be
very
wonderful
,
 
much
more
difficult
than
remember
what
be
in
the
book
;
and
she
be
rather
in
awe
of
Tom
's
superiority
,
for
he
be
the
only
person
who
call
her
knowledge
"
stuff
,
"
and
do
not
feel
surprised
at
her
cleverness
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
indeed
,
be
of
opinion
that
Maggie
be
a
silly
little
thing
;
all
girl
be
silly
,
 
they
could
not
throw
a
stone
so
as
to
hit
anything
,
could
not
do
anything
with
a
pocket
-
knife
,
and
be
frighten
at
frog
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
be
very
fond
of
his
sister
,
and
mean
always
to
take
care
of
her
,
make
her
his
housekeeper
,
and
punish
her
when
she
do
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
on
their
way
to
the
Round
Pool
,
 
that
wonderful
pool
,
which
the
flood
have
make
a
long
while
ago
.
<EOS>
no
one
know
how
deep
it
be
;
and
it
be
mysterious
,
too
,
that
it
should
be
almost
a
perfect
round
,
frame
in
with
willow
and
tall
reed
,
so
that
the
water
be
only
to
be
see
when
you
get
close
to
the
brink
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
the
old
favorite
spot
always
heighten
Tom
's
good
humor
,
and
he
speak
to
Maggie
in
the
most
amicable
whisper
,
as
he
open
the
precious
basket
and
prepare
their
tackle
.
<EOS>
He
throw
her
line
for
her
,
and
put
the
rod
into
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Maggie
think
it
probable
that
the
small
fish
would
come
to
her
hook
,
and
the
large
one
to
Tom
's
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
forget
all
about
the
fish
,
and
be
look
dreamily
at
the
glassy
water
,
when
Tom
say
,
in
a
loud
whisper
,
"
look
,
look
,
Maggie
!
"
and
come
run
to
prevent
her
from
snatch
her
line
away
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
be
frightened
lest
she
have
be
do
something
wrong
,
as
usual
,
but
presently
Tom
draw
out
her
line
and
bring
a
large
tench
bounce
on
the
grass
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
be
excited
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
Magsie
,
you
little
duck
!
<EOS>
empty
the
basket
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
be
not
conscious
of
unusual
merit
,
but
it
be
enough
that
Tom
call
her
Magsie
,
and
be
pleased
with
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
mar
her
delight
in
the
whisper
and
the
dreamy
silence
,
when
she
listen
to
the
light
dripping
sound
of
the
rise
fish
,
and
the
gentle
rustling
,
as
if
the
willow
and
the
reed
and
the
water
have
their
happy
whispering
also
.
<EOS>
Maggie
think
it
would
make
a
very
nice
heaven
to
sit
by
the
pool
in
that
way
,
and
never
be
scold
.
<EOS>
She
never
know
she
have
a
bite
till
Tom
tell
her
;
but
she
like
fish
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
their
happy
morning
.
<EOS>
They
trot
along
and
sit
down
together
,
with
no
thought
that
life
would
ever
change
much
for
them
;
they
would
only
get
big
and
not
go
to
school
,
and
it
would
always
be
like
the
holiday
;
they
would
always
live
together
and
be
fond
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
and
the
mill
with
its
booming
;
the
great
chestnut
-
tree
under
which
they
play
at
house
;
their
own
little
river
,
the
Ripple
,
where
the
bank
seem
like
home
,
and
Tom
be
always
see
the
water
-
rat
,
while
Maggie
gather
the
purple
plumy
top
of
the
reed
,
which
she
forget
and
drop
afterward
;
above
all
,
the
great
Floss
,
along
which
they
wander
with
a
sense
of
travel
,
to
see
the
rush
spring
-
tide
,
the
awful
Eagle
,
come
up
like
a
hungry
monster
,
or
to
see
the
Great
Ash
which
have
once
wail
and
groan
like
a
man
,
these
thing
would
always
be
just
the
same
to
them
.
<EOS>
Tom
think
people
be
at
a
disadvantage
who
live
on
any
other
spot
of
the
globe
;
and
Maggie
,
when
she
read
about
Christiana
pass
"
the
river
over
which
there
be
no
bridge
,
"
always
see
the
Floss
between
the
green
pasture
by
the
Great
Ash
.
  
<EOS>
life
do
change
for
Tom
and
Maggie
;
and
yet
they
be
not
wrong
in
believe
that
the
thought
and
love
of
these
first
year
would
always
make
part
of
their
life
.
<EOS>
We
could
never
have
love
the
earth
so
well
if
we
have
have
no
childhood
in
it
,
 
if
it
be
not
the
earth
where
the
same
flower
come
up
again
every
spring
that
we
use
to
gather
with
our
tiny
finger
as
we
sit
lisp
to
ourselves
on
the
grass
;
the
same
hip
and
haw
on
the
autumn
's
hedgerow
;
the
same
redbreast
that
we
use
to
call
"
God
's
bird
,
"
because
they
do
no
harm
to
the
precious
crop
.
<EOS>
what
novelty
be
worth
that
sweet
monotony
where
everything
be

Our

<EOS>
few
wife
be
more
submissive
than
Mrs.

on
all
point
unconnecte
with
her
family
relation
;
but
she
have
be
a
Miss
Dodson
,
and
the
Dodsons
be
a
very
respectable
family
indeed
,
 
as
much
look
up
to
as
any
in
their
own
parish
,
or
the
next
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
Miss
Dodsons
have
always
be
think
to
hold
up
their
head
very
high
,
and
no
one
be
surprised
the
two
eld
have
marry
<EOS>
so
well
,
 
not
at
an
early
age
,
for
that
be
not
the
practice
of
the
Dodson
family
.
<EOS>
there
be
particular
way
of
do
everything
in
that
family
:
particular
way
of
bleach
the
linen
,
of
make
the
cowslip
wine
,
cure
the
ham
,
and
keep
the
bottled
gooseberry
;
so
that
no
daughter
of
that
house
could
be
indifferent
to
the
privilege
of
have
be
bear
a
Dodson
,
rather
than
a
Gibson
or
a
Watson
.
<EOS>
funeral
be
always
conduct
with
peculiar
propriety
in
the
Dodson
family
:
the
hat
-
band
be
never
of
a
blue
shade
,
the
glove
never
split
at
the
thumb
,
everybody
be
a
mourner
who
ought
to
be
,
and
there
be
always
scarf
for
the
bearer
.
<EOS>
when
one
of
the
family
be
in
trouble
or
sickness
,
all
the
rest
go
to
visit
the
unfortunate
member
,
usually
at
the
same
time
,
and
do
not
shrink
from
utter
the
most
disagreeable
truth
that
correct
family
feel
dictate
;
if
the
illness
or
trouble
be
the
sufferer
's
own
fault
,
it
be
not
in
the
practice
of
the
Dodson
family
to
shrink
from
say
so
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
there
be
in
this
family
a
peculiar
tradition
as
to
what
be
the
right
thing
in
household
management
and
social
demeanor
,
and
the
only
bitter
circumstance
attend
this
superiority
be
a
painful
inability
to
approve
the
condiment
or
the
conduct
of
family
ungoverne
by
the
Dodson
tradition
.
<EOS>
a
female
Dodson
,
when
in
"
strange
house
,
"
always
eat
dry
bread
with
her
tea
,
and
decline
any
sort
of
preserve
,
have
no
confidence
in
the
butter
,
and
think
that
the
preserve
have
probably
begin
to
ferment
from
want
of
due
sugar
and
boiling
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
Dodsons
less
like
the
family
than
other
,
that
be
admit
;
but
in
so
far
as
they
be
"
kin
,
"
they
be
of
necessity
well
than
those
who
be
"
no
kin

<EOS>
and
it
be
remarkable
that
while
no
individual
Dodson
be
satisfied
with
any
other
individual
Dodson
,
each
be
satisfied
,
not
only
with
him
or
her
self
,
but
with
the
dodson
collectively
.
<EOS>
the
feeble
member
of
a
family
 
<EOS>
the
one
who
have
the
least
character
 
be
often
the
mere
epitome
of
the
family
habit
and
tradition
;
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
a
thorough
Dodson
,
though
a
mild
one
,
as
small
-
beer
,
so
long
as
it
be
anything
,
be
only
describable
as
very
weak
ale
:
and
though
she
have
groan
a
little
in
her
youth
under
the
yoke
of
her
elder
sister
,
and
still
shed
occasional
tear
at
their
sisterly
reproach
,
it
be
not
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
be
an
innovator
on
the
family
idea
.
<EOS>
She
be
thankful
to
have
be
a
Dodson
,
and
to
have
one
child
who
take
after
her
own
family
,
at
least
in
his
feature
and
complexion
,
in
like
salt
and
in
eat
bean
,
which
a
Tulliver
never
do
.
  
<EOS>
in
other
respect
the
true
Dodson
be
partly
latent
in
Tom
,
and
he
be
as
far
from
appreciate
his
"
kin
"
on
the
mother
's
side
as
Maggie
herself
,
generally
abscond
for
the
day
with
a
large
supply
of
the
most
portable
food
,
when
he
receive
timely
warning
that
his
aunt
and
uncle
be
come
,
 
a
moral
symptom
from
which
his
aunt
Glegg
deduce
the
gloomy
view
of
his
future
.
<EOS>
It
be
rather
hard
on
Maggie
that
Tom
always
abscond
without
let
her
into
the
secret
,
but
the
weak
sex
be
acknowledge
to
be
serious
_
impedimenta
_
in
case
of
flight
.
  
<EOS>
on
Wednesday
,
the
day
before
the
aunt
and
uncle
be
come
,
there
be
such
various
and
suggestive
scent
,
as
of
plumcake
in
the
oven
and
jelly
in
the
hot
state
,
mingle
with
the
aroma
of
gravy
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
feel
altogether
gloomy
:
there
be
hope
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
Tom
and
Maggie
make
several
inroad
into
the
kitchen
,
and
,
like
other
marauder
,
be
induce
to
keep
aloof
for
a
time
only
by
be
allow
to
carry
away
a
sufficient
load
of
booty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom

"
say
Maggie
,
as
they
sit
on
the
bough
of
the

,
eat
their

,
"

<EOS>
"
no

Tom

slowly

when
he

<EOS>

Tom
,
open
his
pocket

knife
and
hold
it
over
the
puff
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
in
a
dubitative
manner
.
<EOS>
(
It
be
a
difficult
problem
to
divide
that
very
irregular
polygon
into
two
equal

)
<EOS>
"

say
Maggie
,
exert
her
hypothetic
power
,
while
she
lean
forward
toward
Tom
with
her
eye
fix
on
the
hovering
knife
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

you
silly

that

<EOS>
It

I

"
  
<EOS>
with
this
interjection
,
the
knife
descend
on
the
puff
,
and
it
be
in
two
,
but
the
result
be
not
satisfactory
to
Tom
,
for
he
still
eye
the
half
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
,
    
"
shut
your

Maggie

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
for

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never

<EOS>
Maggie
obey

<EOS>
"
now
,
which'll
you
have

Maggie
,
 
right

or

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
that

the

run
out

"
say
Maggie
,
keep
her
eye
shut
to
please
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
do
not
like
that

you
silly

<EOS>
You
may
have
it

Tom

in

exasperation

as
Maggie

<EOS>
"
You
keep

else
you

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
power
of
sacrifice
do
not
extend
so
far
;
indeed
,
I
fear
she
care
less
<EOS>
that
Tom
should
enjoy
the
utmost
possible
amount
of
puff
,
than
that
he
should
be
pleased
with
her
for
give
him
the
good
bit
.
<EOS>
so
she
shut
her
eye
quite
close
,
till
Tom
tell
her
to
"
say
which
,
"
and
then
she
say
,
"
leave
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
it

"
say
Tom
,
in
rather
a
bitter
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
the
bit
with
the
jam
run
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
;
here

take
it

"
say
Tom
,
firmly
,
handing
,
decidedly
the
good
piece
to
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

please
,
Tom
,
have
it

I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
sha'n"t
,
"
say
Tom
,
almost
crossly
,
begin
on
his
own
inferior
piece
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
think
it
be
no
use
to
contend
further
,
begin
too
,
and
eat
up
her
half
puff
with
considerable
relish
as
well
as
rapidity
.
<EOS>
but
Tom
have
finish
first
,
and
have
to
look
on
while
Maggie
eat
her
last
morsel
or
two
,
feel
in
himself
a
capacity
for
more
.
<EOS>
Maggie
do
not
know
Tom
be
look
at
her
;
she
be
seesaw
on
the
elder
-
bough
,
lose
to
almost
everything
but
a
vague
sense
of
jam
and
idleness
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
greedy
thing
!
<EOS>
"
say
Tom
,
when
she
have
swallow
the
last
morsel
.
<EOS>
He
be
conscious
of
have
act
very
fairly
,
and
think
she
ought
to
have
consider
this
,
and
make
up
to
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
refuse
a
bit
of
her
beforehand
,
but
one
be
naturally
at
a
different
point
of
view
before
and
after
one
's
own
share
of
puff
be
swallow
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
turn
quite
pale
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Tom
,
why
do
not
you
ask
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
ask
you
for
a
bit

you
greedy

<EOS>
You
may
have
think
of
it
without
,
when
you
know
I
give
you
the
good
bit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
want
you
to
have
it
;
you
know
I
do
,
"
say
Maggie
,
in
an
injure
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
I
be
not
go
to
do
what
be
not
fair
,
like
Spouncer
.
<EOS>
He
always
take
the
good
bit
,
if
you
do
not
punch
him
for
it
;
and
if
you
choose
the
good
with
your
eye
shut
,
he
change
his
hand
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
go
halve
,
I
will
go
'em
fair
;
only
I
would
not
be
a
greedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
cut
innuendo
,
Tom
jump
down
from
his
bough
,
and
throw
a
stone
with
a
"
hoigh
!
"
<EOS>
as
a
friendly
attention
to
Yap
,
who
have
also
be
look
on
while
the
eatable
vanish
,
with
an
agitation
of
his
ear
and
feeling
which
could
hardly
have
be
without
bitterness
.
<EOS>
yet
the
excellent
dog
accept
Tom
's
attention
with
as
much
alacrity
as
if
he
have
be
treat
quite
generously
.
  
<EOS>
but
Maggie
,
gift
with
that
superior
power
of
misery
which
distinguish
the
human
being
,
and
place
him
at
a
proud
distance
from
the
most
melancholy
chimpanzee
,
sit
still
on
her
bough
,
and
give
herself
up
to
the
keen
sense
of
unmerited
reproach
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
give
the
world
not
to
have
eat
all
her
puff
,
and
to
have
save
some
of
it
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
the
puff
be
very
nice
,
for
Maggie
's
palate
be
not
at
all
obtuse
,
but
she
would
have
go
without
it
many
time
over
,
sooner
than
Tom
should
call
her
greedy
and
be
cross
with
her
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
say
he
would
not
have
it
,
and
she
eat
it
without
think
;
how
could
she
help
it
?
<EOS>
the
tear
flow
so
plentifully
that
Maggie
see
nothing
around
her
for
the
next
ten
minute
;
but
by
that
time
resentment
begin
to
give
way
to
the
desire
of
reconciliation
,
and
she
jump
from
her
bough
to
look
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
longer
in
the
paddock
behind
the
rickyard
;
where
be
he
likely
to
be
go
,
and
Yap
with
him
?
<EOS>
Maggie
run
to
the
high
bank
against
the
great
holly
-
tree
,
where
she
could
see
far
away
toward
the
Floss
.
<EOS>
there
be
Tom
;
but
her
heart
sink
again
as
she
see
how
far
off
he
be
on
his
way
to
the
great
river
,
and
that
he
have
another
companion
besides
Yap
,
 
naughty
Bob
Jakin
,
whose
official
,
if
not
natural
,
function
of
frighten
the
bird
be
just
now
at
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
Maggie
feel
sure
that
Bob
be
wicked
,
without
very
distinctly
know
why
;
unless
it
be
because
Bob
's
mother
be
a
dreadfully
large
fat
woman
,
who
live
at
a
queer
round
house
down
the
river
;
and
once
,
when
Maggie
and
Tom
have
wander
thither
,
there
rush
out
a
brindle
dog
that
would
not
stop
bark
;
and
when
Bob
's
mother
come
out
after
it
,
and
scream
above
the
barking
to
tell
them
not
to
be
frightened
,
Maggie
think
she
be
scold
them
fiercely
,
and
her
heart
beat
with
terror
.
<EOS>
Maggie
think
it
very
likely
that
the
round
house
have
snake
on
the
floor
,
and
bat
in
the
bedroom
;
for
she
have
see
Bob
take
off
his
cap
to
show
Tom
a
little
snake
that
be
inside
it
,
and
another
time
he
have
a
handful
of
young
bat
:
altogether
,
he
be
an
irregular
character
,
perhaps
even
slightly
diabolical
,
judge
from
his
intimacy
with
snake
and
bat
;
and
to
crown
all
,
when
Tom
have
Bob
for
a
companion
<EOS>
,
he
do
not
mind
about
Maggie
,
and
would
never
let
her
go
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
that
Tom
be
fond
of
Bob
's
company
.
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
Bob
know
,
<EOS>
directly
he
see
a
bird
's
egg
,
whether
it
be
a
swallow
's
,
or
a
tomtit
's
,
or
a
yellow
-
hammer
's
;
he
find
out
all
the
wasp
'
nest
,
and
could
set
all
sort
of
trap
;
he
could
climb
the
tree
like
a
squirrel
,
and
have
quite
a
magical
power
of
detect
hedgehog
and
stoat
;
and
he
have
courage
to
do
thing
that
be
rather
naughty
,
such
as
make
gap
in
the
hedgerow
,
throw
stone
after
the
sheep
,
and
kill
a
cat
that
be
wander
_
incognito
_
.
  
<EOS>
such
quality
in
an
inferior
,
who
could
always
be
treat
with
authority
in
spite
of
his
superior
knowingness
,
have
necessarily
a
fatal
fascination
for
Tom
;
and
every
holiday
-
time
Maggie
be
sure
to
have
day
of
grief
because
he
have
go
off
with
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
hope
for
it
;
he
be
go
now
,
and
Maggie
could
think
of
no
comfort
but
to
sit
down
by
the
hollow
,
or
wander
by
the
hedgerow
,
and
fancy
<EOS>
it
be
all
different
,
refashion
her
little
world
into
just
what
she
should
like
it
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
be
a
troublous
life
,
and
this
be
the
form
in
which
she
take
her
opium
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Tom
,
forget
all
about
Maggie
and
the
sting
of
reproach
which
he
have
leave
in
her
heart
,
be
hurry
along
with
Bob
,
whom
he
have
meet
accidentally
,
to
the
scene
of
a
great
rat
-
catching
in
a
neighboring
barn
.
<EOS>
Bob
know
all
about
this
particular
affair
,
and
speak
of
the
sport
with
an
enthusiasm
which
no
one
who
be
not
either
divest
of
all
manly
feeling
,
or
pitiably
ignorant
of
rat
-
catching
,
can
fail
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
for
a
person
suspect
of
preternatural
wickedness
,
Bob
be
really
not
so
very
villanous
-
look
;
there
be
even
something
agreeable
in
his
snub
-
nosed
face
,
with
its
close
-
curled
border
of
red
hair
.
<EOS>
but
then
his
trouser
be
always
roll
up
at
the
knee
,
for
the
convenience
of
wade
on
the
slight
notice
;
and
his
virtue

suppose
it
to
exist
,
be
undeniably
"
virtue

which

on
the

be
notoriously
likely

<EOS>
"
I

in

along

Tom

up

down

Bob
seize
hold
and
keep
it
like
a
cat

and
pull
Tom
down
after
him
.
<EOS>
They
struggle
fiercely
on

ground
for
a
moment

two

till

pin
Bob
down
by

shoulder
,

the
mastery

"

with
difficulty
,
while
he
exert
himself
to
keep
the
command
of
Bob

arm

<EOS>
but
at
this
moment
Yap
,
who
have
be
run
on
before

return
bark
to
the
scene
of
action
,
and
see
a
favorable
opportunity
for
bite
Bob
's
bare
leg
not
only
with
inpunity
but
with
honor
.
<EOS>
the
pain
from
Yap

tooth

instead
of
surprising
Bob
into
a
relaxation
of
his
hold

give
it
a
fiercer
tenacity
,
and
with
a
new
exertion
of
his
force
he
push
Tom
backward
and
get
uppermost

<EOS>
but
now
yap

who
could
get
no
sufficient
purchase

set
his
tooth
in

so
that

way

let
go
his
hold
of
Tom

almost
throttle

fling

by

time

quite
recover

act

down

he
add
,
turn
round
homeward

not
without
cast
a
regret
toward
the
rat
-
catching
and
other
pleasure
which
he
must
relinquish
along
with
Bob
's
society

<EOS>
"
You
may
let

then
,
"
Bob
call
out
after
him

<EOS>
"
I
shall
cheat

on
without

Yap
follow
his

,
the
cold
bath
have
moderate
his
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
along

_
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
would
not

"
say
Bob
,
get
louder
,
in
a
last
effort
to
sustain
his
defiance
.
<EOS>
but
Tom
be
not
to
be
provoke
into
turn
round
,
and
Bob
's
voice
begin
to
falter
a
little
as
he
say
,
    
<EOS>
"
an
'
I'n
gi'en
you
everything
<EOS>
,
an
'
show
you
everything
,
an
'
niver
want
nothing
from
you

<EOS>
an
'
there
be
your

-
hand
knife
,
then
as
you
gi'en
me
.
"
<EOS>
here
Bob
fling
the
knife
as
far
as
he
could
after
Tom
's
retreat
footstep
.
<EOS>
but
it
produce
no
effect
,
except
the
sense
in
Bob
's
mind
that
there
be
a
terrible
void
in
his
lot
,
now
that
knife
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
He
stand
still
till
Tom
have
pass
through
the
gate
and
disappear
behind
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
the
knife
would
do
not
good
on
the
ground
there
;
it
would
not
vex
Tom
;
and
pride
or
resentment
be
a
feeble
passion
in
Bob
's
mind
compare
with
the
love
of
a
pocket
-
knife
.
<EOS>
His
very
finger
send
entreat
thrill
that
he
would
go
and
clutch
that
familiar
rough
buck's
-
horn
handle
,
which
they
have
so
often
grasp
for
mere
affection
,
as
it
lie
idle
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
two
blade
,
and
they
have
just
be
sharpen
!
<EOS>
what
be
life
without
a
pocket
-
knife
to
him
who
have
once
taste
a
high
existence
?
<EOS>
no
;
to
throw
the
handle
after
the
hatchet
be
a
comprehensible
act
of
desperation
,
but
to
throw
one
's
pocket
-
knife
after
an
implacable
friend
be
clearly
in
every
sense
a
hyperbole
,
or
throw
beyond
the
mark
.
<EOS>
so
Bob
shuffle
back
to
the
spot
where
the
beloved
knife
lie
in
the
dirt
,
and
feel
quite
a
new
pleasure
in
clutch
it
again
after
the
temporary
separation
,
in
open
one
blade
after
the
other
,
and
feel
their
edge
with
his
well
-
harden
thumb
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bob
!
<EOS>
he
be
not
sensitive
on
the
point
of
honor
,
not
a
chivalrous
character
.
<EOS>
that
fine
moral
aroma
would
not
have
be
think
much
of
by
the
public
opinion
of
Kennel
Yard
,
which
be
the
very
focus
or
heart
of
Bob
's
world
,
even
if
it
could
have
make
itself
perceptible
there
;
yet
,
for
all
that
,
he
be
not
utterly
a
sneak
and
a
thief
as
our
friend
Tom
have
hastily
decide
.
  
<EOS>
but
Tom
,
you
perceive
,
be
rather
a
Rhadamanthine
personage
,
have
more
than
the
usual
share
of
boy
's
justice
in
him
,
 
the
justice
that
desire
to
hurt
culprit
as
much
as
they
deserve
to
be
hurt
,
and
be
troubled
with
no
doubt
concern
the
exact
amount
of
their
desert
.
<EOS>
Maggie
see
a
cloud
on
his
brow
when
he
come
home
,
which
check
her
joy
at
his
come
so
much
sooner
than
she
have
expect
,
and
she
dare
hardly
speak
to
him
as
he
stand
silently
throw
the
small
gravel
-
stone
into
the
mill
-
dam
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
pleasant
to
give
up
a
rat
-
catching
when
you
have
set
your
mind
on
it
.
<EOS>
but
if
Tom
have
tell
his
strong
feeling
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
say
,
"
I
would
do
just
the
same
again
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
his
usual
mode
of
view
his
past
action
;
whereas
Maggie
be
always
wish
she
have
do
something
different
.
    
<EOS>
enter
the
Aunts
and
Uncles
  
<EOS>
the
Dodsons
be
certainly
a
handsome
family
,
and
Mrs.
Glegg
be
not
the
least
handsome
of
the
sister
.
<EOS>
as
she
sit
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
arm
-
chair
,
no
impartial
observer
could
have
deny
that
for
a
woman
of
fifty
she
have
a
very
comely
face
and
figure
,
though
Tom
and
Maggie
consider
their
aunt
Glegg
as
the
type
of
ugliness
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
she
despise
the
advantage
of
costume
,
for
though
,
as
she
often
observe
,
no
woman
have
well
clothe
,
it
be
not
her
way
to
wear
her
new
thing
out
before
her
old
one
.
<EOS>
other
woman
,
if
they
like
,
may
have
their
good
thread
-
lace
in
every
wash
;
but
when
Mrs.
Glegg
die
,
it
would
be
find
that
she
have
well
lace
lay
by
in
the
right
-
hand
drawer
of
her
wardrobe
in
the
Spotted
Chamber
than
ever
Mrs.
Wooll
of
St.
Ogg

have
buy
in
her
life
,
although
Mrs.
Wooll
wear
her
lace
before
it
be
pay
for
.
<EOS>
so
of
her
curled
front
:
Mrs.
Glegg
have
doubtless
the
glossy
and
crispest
brown
curl
in
her
drawer
,
as
well
as
curl
in
various
degree
of
fuzzy
laxness
;
but
to
look
out
on
the

day
world
from
under
a
crisp
and
glossy
front
would
be
to
introduce
a
most
dreamlike
and
unpleasant
confusion
between
the
sacred
and
the
secular
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Glegg
wear
one
of
her
third
-
good
front
on
a
week
-
day
visit
,
but
not
at
a
sister
's
house
;
especially
not
at
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
,
who
,
since
her
marriage
,
have
hurt
her
sister
's
feeling
greatly
by
wear
her
own
hair
,
though
,
as
Mrs.
Glegg
observe
to
Mrs.
Deane
,
a
mother
of
a
family
,
like
Bessy
,
with
a
husband
always
go
to
law
,
may
have
be
expect
to
know
better
.
<EOS>
but
Bessy
be
always
weak
!
  
<EOS>
so
if
Mrs.
Glegg
's
front
to
-
day
be
more
fuzzy
and
lax
than
usual
,
she
have
a
design
under
it
<EOS>
:
she
intend
the
most
pointed
and
cut
allusion
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
bunche
of
blond
curl
,
separate
from
each
other
by
a
due
wave
of
smoothness
on
each
side
of
the
parting
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
shed
tear
several
time
at
sister
Glegg
's
unkindness
on
the
subject
of
these
unmatronly
curl
,
but
the
consciousness
of
look
the
handsomer
for
them
naturally
administer
support
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
choose
to
wear
her
bonnet
in
the
house
to
-
day
,
 
untie
and
tilt
slightly
,
of
course
 
a
frequent
practice
of
her
when
she
be
on
a
visit
,
and
happen
to
be
in
a
severe
humor
:
she
do
not
know
what
draught
there
may
be
in
strange
house
.
<EOS>
for
the
same
reason
she
wear
a
small
sable
tippet
,
which
reach
just
to
her
shoulder
,
and
be
very
far
from
meet
across
her
well
-
form
chest
,
while
her
long
neck
be
protect
by
a
_
chevaux
-
de

frise
_
of
miscellaneous
frilling
.
<EOS>
one
would
need
to
be
learn
in
the
fashion
of
those
time
to
know
how
far
in
the
rear
of
them
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
's
slate
-
color
silk
gown
must
have
be
;
but
from
certain
constellation
of
small
yellow
spot
upon
it
,
and
a
mouldy
odor
about
it
suggestive
of
a
damp
clothe
-
chest
,
it
be
probable
that
it
belong
to
a
stratum
of
garment
just
old
enough
to
have
come
recently
into
wear
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
hold
her
large
gold
watch
in
her
hand
with
the
many

double
chain
round
her
finger
,
and
observe
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
who
have
just
return
from
a
visit
to
the
kitchen
,
that
whatever
it
may
be

It
use

it

in
tear
when

it
be
apparently
requisite

should
shed
a

more
before
get
out
;
for
though
her

Mrs.

stand
ready

support

she
sit
still

sadly

She

it

her
that

possibly
break
for
the
second

there

a
further
shake

as
Mrs.

slowly
rise

get
down
from
the
chaise
,
not
without
cast
a
glance
at
Mr.

to
see
that
he
be
guard
her
handsome
silk
dress
from
injury

Mr.

be
a
small
man

with
a
high

small
twinkle
eye

and
thin
lip

in
a
fresh

looking
suit

black

a
white
cravat

tie
very
tight

abundant
mantle

large

beribbone
bonnet

<EOS>
It
be
a
pathetic
sight

a
strike
example
of
the
complexity
introduce
into
the
emotion
by
a
high
state
of
civilization

the
sight
of
a
fashionably
dress
female
in
grief

from
the
sorrow
of

that
of

an

delicate

in
the

abandonment
characteristic

check

with

with
a
too

devious
step
through
a
door

place
,
she
may
crush
her
buckram
sleeve
too

the
deep
consciousness

this
possibility

a
composition
of
force
by
which
she
take
a
line
that
just
clear
the

<EOS>
perceive
that
the
tear
be
hurry
fast

she
unpin
her
string
and
throw
them
languidly
backward
,
a
touching
gesture
,
indicative
,
even
in
the
deep
gloom
,
of
the
hope
in
future
dry
moment
when
cap

will
once

as

You

It

Mrs.

say
Mr.

with

Mrs.

you

<EOS>
she
add
,
turn
to
her

<EOS>
Mr.
Pullet
,
by
an
unaccountable
lapse
of
memory
,
have
forget
it
,
and
hasten
out
,
with
a
stricken
conscience
,
to
remedy
the
omission
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
bring
it
upstairs
,
sister
,
"
say
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
wish
to
go
at
once
,
lest
Mrs.
Glegg
should
begin
to
explain
her
feeling
about
Sophy
's
be
the
first
Dodson
who
ever
ruin
her
constitution
with
doctor
's
stuff
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
fond
of
go
upstairs
with
her
sister
Pullet
,
and
look
thoroughly
at
her
cap
before
she
put
it
on
her
head
,
and
discuss
millinery
in
general
.
<EOS>
this
be
part
of
Bessy
's
weakness
that
stir
Mrs.
Glegg
's
sisterly
compassion
:
bessy
go
far
too
well
dressed
,
consider
;
and
she
be
too
proud
to
dress
her
child
in
the
good
clothing
<EOS>
her
sister
Glegg
give
her
from
the
primeval
strata
of
her
wardrobe
;
it
be
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
buy
anything
to
dress
that
child
,
if
it
be
not
a
pair
of
shoe
.
<EOS>
in
this
particular
,
however
,
Mrs.
Glegg
do
her
sister
Bessy
some
injustice
,
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
really
make
great
effort
to
induce
Maggie
to
wear
a
leghorn
bonnet
and
a
dyed
silk
frock
make
out
of
her
aunt
Glegg
's
,
but
the
result
have
be
such
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
oblige
to
bury
them
in
her
maternal
bosom
;
for
Maggie
,
declare
that
the
frock
smelt
of
nasty
dye
,
have
take
an
opportunity
of
baste
it
together
with
the
roast
beef
the
first
Sunday
she
wear
it
,
and
find
this
scheme
answer
,
she
have
subsequently
pump
on
the
bonnet
with
its
green
ribbon
,
so
as
to
give
it
a
general
resemblance
to
a
sage
cheese
garnish
with
withered
lettuce
.
<EOS>
I
must
urge
in
excuse
for
Maggie
,
that
Tom
have
laugh
at
her
in
the
bonnet
,
and
say
she
look
like
an
old
Judy
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
,
too
,
make
present
of
clothe
,
but
these
be
always
pretty
enough
to
please
Maggie
as
well
as
her
mother
.
<EOS>
of
all
her
sister
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
certainly
prefer
her
sister
Pullet
,
not
without
a
return
of
preference
;
but
Mrs.
Pullet
be
sorry
Bessy
have
those
naughty
,
awkward
child
;
she
would
do
the
good
she
could
by
them
,
but
it
be
a
pity
they
be
not
as
good
and
as
pretty
as
sister
Deane
's
child
.
<EOS>
Maggie
and
Tom
,
on
their
part
,
think
their
aunt
Pullet
tolerable
,
chiefly
because
she
be
not
their
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
Tom
always
decline
to
go
more
than
once
during
his
holiday
to
see
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
both
his
uncle
tip
him
that
once
,
of
course
;
but
at
his
aunt
Pullet
's
there
be
a
great
many
toad
to
pelt
in
the
cellar
-
area
,
so
that
he
prefer
the
visit
to
her
.
<EOS>
Maggie
shudder
at
the
toad
,
and
dream
of
them
horribly
,
but
she
like
her
uncle
Pullet
's
musical
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
still
,
it
be
agree
by
the
sister
,
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
absence
,
that
the
Tulliver
blood
do
not
mix
well
with
the
Dodson
blood
;
that
,
in
fact
,
poor
Bessy
's
child
be
tulliver
,
and
that
Tom
,
notwithstanding
he
have
the
Dodson
complexion
,
be
likely
to
be
as
"
contrairy
"
as
his
father
.
<EOS>
as
for
Maggie
,
she
be
the
picture
of
her
aunt
Moss
,
Mr.
Tulliver
's
sister
,
 
a
large
-
boned
woman
,
who
have
marry
as
poorly
as
could
be
;
have
no
china
,
and
have
a
husband
who
have
much
ado
to
pay
his
rent
.
<EOS>
but
when
Mrs.
Pullet
be
alone
with
Mrs.
Tulliver
upstairs
,
the
remark
be
naturally
to
the
disadvantage
of
Mrs.
Glegg
,
and
they
agree
,
in
confidence
,
that
there
be
no
know
what
sort
of
fright
sister
Jane
would
come
out
next
.
<EOS>
but
their
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
be
curtail
by
the
appearance
of
Mrs.
Deane
with
little
Lucy
;
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
to
look
on
with
a
silent
pang
while
Lucy
's
blond
curl
be
adjust
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
unaccountable
that
Mrs.
Deane
,
the
thin
and
sallow
of
all
the
Miss
Dodsons
,
should
have
have
this
child
,
who
may
have
be
take
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
any
day
.
<EOS>
and
Maggie
always
look
twice
as
dark
as
usual
when
she
be
by
the
side
of
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
to
-
day
,
when
she
and
Tom
come
in
from
the
garden
with
their
father
and
their
uncle
Glegg
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
throw
her
bonnet
off
very
carelessly
,
and
come
in
with
her
hair
rough
as
well
as
out
of
curl
,
rush
at
once
to
Lucy
,
who
be
stand
by
her
mother
's
knee
.
<EOS>
certainly
the
contrast
between
the
cousin
be
conspicuous
,
and
to
superficial
eye
be
very
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
Maggie
though
a
connoisseur
may
have
see
"
point
"
in
her
which
have
a
high
promise
for
maturity
than
Lucy
's
natty
completeness
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
contrast
between
a
rough
,
dark
,
overgrown
puppy
and
a
white
kitten
.
<EOS>
Lucy
put
up
the
neatest
little
rosebud
mouth
to
be
kiss
;
everything
about
her
be
neat
,
 
her
little
round
neck
,
with
the
row
of
coral
bead
;
her
little
straight
nose
,
not
at
all
snubby
;
her
little
clear
eyebrow
,
rather
dark
than
her
curl
,
to
match
hazel
eye
,
which
look
up
with
shy
pleasure
at
Maggie
,
tall
by
the
head
,
though
scarcely
a
year
old
.
<EOS>
Maggie
always
look
at
Lucy
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
fond
of
fancy
a
world
where
the
people
never
get
any
large
than
child
of
their
own
age
,
and
she
make
the
queen
of
it
just
like
Lucy
,
with
a
little
crown
on
her
head
,
and
a
little
sceptre
in
her
hand
 
only
the
queen
be
Maggie
herself
in
Lucy

form

<EOS>
"
oh

she
burst
out

after
kiss
her

you

Tom

have
come
up
to
Lucy

but
he
be
not

to

her
 
no

he
come
up
to
her
with
Maggie

because
it
seem

,
"

"
to
all

He

with
the
blushing

awkward
air
and
semi

smile
which
be
common
to
shy

when
in
company

very
much
as
if
they
have
come
into

by
mistake

find
it
in
a
degree

undress

Aunt

emphatic

as
if
she
consider

rather
idiotic

it

a

she
think

of
make

Bessy

she
add

look
over

<EOS>
"
I

Mrs.

shut
her

close
again

it

arrest
by
the
desire

Aunt

would
hardly

<EOS>
You
may
see
nobleman

you
may
see

He

scissor

Maggie

off

Snip

<EOS>
go
the
great
scissor
again
while
Tom
be
speak
,
and
he
could
not

feel
it
be
rather
good
fun
;
Maggie

look

queer

"
here

You

"
never

make
haste

"
<EOS>

Maggie

give

little
stamp
with

Her
cheek
be
quite
flush

<EOS>
the
black
lock
be
so
thick
,
nothing
could
be
more
tempting
to
a
lad
who
have
already
taste
the
forbid
pleasure
of
cut
the
pony
's
mane
.
<EOS>
I
speak
to
those
who
know
the
satisfaction
of
make
a
pair
of
scissor
meet
through
a
duly
resist
mass
of
hair
.
<EOS>
one
delicious
grinding
snip
,
and
then
another
and
another
,
and
the
hinder
-
lock
fall
heavily
on
the
floor
,
and
Maggie
stand
crop
in
a
jagged
,
uneven
manner
,
but
with
a
sense
of
clearness
and
freedom
,
as
if
she
have
emerge
from
a
wood
into
the
open
plain
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Maggie
,
"
say
Tom
,
jump
round
her
,
and
slap
his
knee
as
he
laugh
,
"
oh
,
my
button
!
<EOS>
what
a
queer
thing
you
look
!
<EOS>
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
;
you
look
like
the
idiot
we
throw
out
nutshell
to
at
school
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
feel
an
unexpected
pang
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
beforehand
chiefly
at
her
own
deliverance
from
her
teasing
hair
and
teasing
remark
about
it
,
and
something
also
of
the
triumph
she
should
have
over
her
mother
and
her
aunt
by
this
very
decide
course
of
action
;
she
do
not
want
her
hair
to
look
pretty
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
out
of
the
question
,
 
she
only
want
people
to
think
her
a
clever
little
girl
,
and
not
to
find
fault
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
Tom
begin
to
laugh
at
her
,
and
say
she
be
like
an
idiot
,
the
affair
have
quite
a
new
aspect
.
<EOS>
She
look
in
the
glass
,
and
still
Tom
laugh
and
clap
his
hand
,
and
Maggie
's
cheek
begin
to
pale
,
and
her
lip
to
tremble
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Maggie
,
you
will
have
to
go
down
to
dinner
directly
,
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
my
!
"
  
"
do
not
laugh
at
me
,
Tom
,
"
say
Maggie
,
in
a
passionate
tone
,
with
an
outburst
of
angry
tear
,
stamp
,
and
give
him
a
push
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
then
,
spitfire
!
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
cut
it
off
for
,
then
?
<EOS>
I
shall
go
down
:
<EOS>
I
can
smell
the
dinner
go
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
hurry
downstairs
and
leave
poor
Maggie
to
that
bitter
sense
of
the
irrevocable
which
be
almost
an
every
-
day
experience
of
her
small
soul
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
clearly
enough
,
now
the
thing
be
do
,
that
it
be
very
foolish
,
and
that
she
should
have
to
hear
and
think
more
about
her
hair
than
ever
;
for
Maggie
rush
to
her
deed
with
passionate
impulse
,
and
then
see
not
only
their
consequence
,
but
what
would
have
happen
if
they
have
not
be
do
,
with
all
the
detail
and
exaggerated
circumstance
of
an
active
imagination
.
<EOS>
Tom
never
do
the
same
sort
of
foolish
thing
as
Maggie
,
have
a
wonderful
instinctive
discernment
of
what
would
turn
to
his
advantage
or
disadvantage
;
and
so
it
happen
,
that
though
he
be
much
more
wilful
and
inflexible
than
Maggie
,
his
mother
hardly
ever
call
him
naughty
.
<EOS>
but
if
Tom
do
make
a
mistake
of
that
sort
,
he
espouse
it
,
and
stand
by
it
:
<EOS>
he
"
do
not
mind
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
break
the
lash
of
his
father
's
gigwhip
by
lash
the
gate
,
he
could
not
help
it
,
 
the
whip
should
not
have
get
catch
in
the
hinge
.
<EOS>
if
Tom
Tulliver
whip
a
gate
,
he
be
convince
,
not
that
the
whipping
of
gate
by
all
boy
be
a
justifiable
act
,
but
that
he
,
Tom
Tulliver
,
be
justifiable
in
whip
that
particular
gate
,
and
he
be
not
go
to
be
sorry
.
<EOS>
but
Maggie
,
as
she
stand
cry
before
the
glass
,
feel
it
impossible
that
she
should
go
down
to
dinner
and
endure
the
severe
eye
and
severe
word
of
her
aunt
,
while
Tom
and
Lucy
,
and
Martha
,
who
wait
at
table
,
and
perhaps
her
father
and
her
uncle
,
would
laugh
at
her
;
for
if
Tom
have
laugh
at
her
,
of
course
every
one
else
would
;
and
if
she
have
only
let
her
hair
alone
,
she
could
have
sit
with
Tom
and
Lucy
,
and
have
the
apricot
pudding
and
the
custard
!
<EOS>
what
could
she
do
but
sob
?
<EOS>
She
sit
as
helpless
and
despair
among
her
black
lock
as
Ajax
among
the
slaughter
sheep
.
<EOS>
very
trivial
,
perhaps
,
this
anguish
seem
to
weather
-
wear
mortal
who
have
to
think
of
Christmas
bill
,
dead
love
,
and
break
friendship
;
but
it
be
not
less
bitter
to
Maggie
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
even
more
bitter
 
than
what
we
be
fond
of
call
antithetically
the
real
trouble
of
mature
life
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
my
child
,
you
will
have
real
trouble
to
fret
about
by
and
by
,
"
be
the
consolation
we
have
almost
all
of
us
have
administer
to
us
in
our
childhood
,
and
have
repeat
to
other
child
since
we
have
be
grow
up
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
of
us
sob
so
piteously
,
stand
with
tiny
bare
leg
above
our
little
sock
,
when
we
lose
sight
of
our
mother
or
nurse
in
some
strange
place
;
but
we
can
no
longer
recall
the
poignancy
of
that
moment
and
weep
over
it
,
as
we
do
over
the
remembered
suffering
of
five
or
ten
year
ago
.
<EOS>
every
one
of
those
keen
moment
have
leave
its
trace
,
and
live
in
us
still
,
but
such
trace
have
blent
themselves
irrecoverably
with
the
firm
texture
of
our
youth
and
manhood
;
and
so
it
come
that
we
can
look
on
at
the
trouble
of
our
child
with
a
smile
disbelief
in
the
reality
of
their
pain
.
<EOS>
be
there
any
one
who
can
recover
the
experience
of
his
childhood
,
not
merely
with
a
memory
_
of
_
what
he
do
and
what
happen
to
him
,
of
what
he
like
and
dislike
when
he
be
in
frock
and
trouser
,
but
with
an
intimate
penetration
,
a
revive
consciousness
of
what
he
feel
then
,
when
it
be
so
long
from
one
Midsummer
to
another
;
what
he
feel
when
his
school
fellow
shut
him
out
of
their
game
because
he
would
pitch
the
ball
wrong
out
of
mere
wilfulness
;
or
on
a
rainy
day
in
the
holiday
,
when
he
do
not
know
how
to
amuse
himself
,
and
fall
from
idleness
into
mischief
,
from
mischief
into
defiance
,
and
from
defiance
into
sulkiness
;
or
when
his
mother
absolutely
refuse
to
let
him
have
a
tail
coat
<EOS>
that
"
half
,
"
although
every
other
boy
of
his
age
have
go
into
tail
already
?
<EOS>
surely
if
we
could
recall
that
early
bitterness
,
and
the
dim
guess
,
the
strangely
perspectiveless
conception
of
life
,
that
give
the
bitterness
its
intensity
,
we
should
not
pooh
-
pooh
<EOS>
the
griefs
of
our
child
.

"

It

He
be
not
incline
to

do

he
go
and
put
his
head
near

and
say
in

His

slowly

for
Kezia

a

Her

which

<EOS>
Mrs.

's
domestic
sorrow
seem
at
this
moment
to
have
reach
the
point
at
which
insensibility
begin
.
<EOS>
She
take
no
notice
of
her

remark

throw
back
her
capstring
and
dispense
the
pudding
,
in
mute
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
dessert
there
come
entire
deliverance
for
Maggie
,
for
the
child
be
tell
they
may
have
their
nut
and
wine
in
the
summer
-
house
,
since
the
day
be
so
mild
;
and
they
scamper
out
among
the
bud
bush
of
the
garden
with
the
alacrity
of
small
animal
get
from
under
a
burn
glass
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
her
special
reason
for
this
permission
:
now
the
dinner
be
despatch
,
and
every
one
's
mind
disengage
,
it
be
the
right
moment
to
communicate
Mr.
Tulliver
's
intention
concern
Tom
,
and
it
would
be
as
well
for
Tom
himself
to
be
absent
.
<EOS>
the
child
be
use
to
hear
themselves
talk
of
as
freely
as
if
they
be
bird
,
and
could
understand
nothing
,
however
they
may
stretch
their
neck
and
listen
;
but
on
this
occasion
Mrs.
Tulliver
manifest
an
unusual
discretion
,
because
she
have
recently
have
evidence
that
the
go
to
school
to
a
clergyman
be
a
sore
point
with
Tom
,
who
look
at
it
as
very
much
on
a
par
with
go
to
school
to
a
constable
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
a
sighing
sense
that
her
husband
would
do
as
he
like
,
whatever
sister
Glegg
say
,
or
sister
Pullet
either
;
but
at
least
they
would
not
be
able
to
say
,
if
the
thing
turn
out
ill
,
that
Bessy
have
fall
in
with
her
husband
's
folly
without
let
her
own
friend
know
a
word
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.

,
"
she
say
,
interrupt
her
husband
in
his
talk
with
Mr.

"
it
be
time
now
to
tell
the

aunt

you

be
not
it

<EOS>
"
  
"
very
well

Mr.

rather
sharply
,
"
I
have
no
objection

tell
anybody

I

settle

he
add
,
look
toward
Mr.

and
Mr.
Deane
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
settle
to
send
him
to
a
Mr.
Stelling
,
a
parson
,
down
at
King
's
Lorton
,
there
,
 
an
uncommon
clever
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
understand
,
as'll
put
him
up
to
most
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
rustle
demonstration
of
surprise
in
the
company
,
such
as
you
may
have
observe
in
a
country
congregation
when
they
hear
an
allusion
to
their
week
-
day
affair
from
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
It
be
equally
astonishing
to
the
aunt
and
uncle
to
find
a
parson
introduce
into
Mr.
Tulliver
's
family
arrangement
.
<EOS>
as
for
uncle
Pullet
,
he
could
hardly
have
be
more
thoroughly
obfuscate
if
Mr.
Tulliver
have
say
that
he
be
go
to
send
Tom
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
;
for
uncle
Pullet
belong
to
that
extinct
class
of
british
yeoman
who
,
dress
in
good
broadcloth
,
pay
high
rate
and
taxis
,
go
to
church
,
and
eat
a
particularly
good
dinner
on
Sunday
,
without
dream
that
the
british
constitution
in
Church
and
State
have
a
traceable
origin
any
more
than
the
solar
system
and
the
fix
star
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
melancholy
,
but
true
,
that
Mr.
Pullet
have
the
most
confused
idea
of
a
bishop
as
a
sort
of
a
baronet
,
who
may
or
may
not
be
a
clergyman
;
and
as
the
rector
of
his
own
parish
be
a
man
of
high
family
and
fortune
,
the
idea
that
a
clergyman
could
be
a
schoolmaster
be
too
remote
from
Mr.
Pullet
's
experience
to
be
readily
conceivable
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
difficult
for
people
in
these
instruct
time
to
believe
in
uncle
Pullet
's
ignorance
;
but
let
them
reflect
on
the
remarkable
result
of
a
great
natural
faculty
under
favor
circumstance
.
<EOS>
and
uncle
Pullet
have
a
great
natural
faculty
for
ignorance
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
first
to
give
utterance
to
his
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
can
you
be
go
to
send
him
to
a
parson
for
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
with
an
amazed
twinkling
in
his
eye
,
look
at
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
,
to
see
if
they
show
any
sign
of
comprehension
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
because
the
parson
be
the
good
schoolmaster
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
,
"
say
poor
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
,
in
the
maze
of
this
puzzling
world
,
lay
hold
of
any
clue
with
great
readiness
and
tenacity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jacobs

no

he
be

very
bad
by

I
make
up
my
mind
,
if
I
send
him
to
school
again
,
it
should
be
to
somebody
different
to
Jacobs

,
in
a
tone
of
decision
,
tap
his
snuff

box

take
a
pinch
.
  
<EOS>
"

Mr.

who
be
fond
of

retire
from

Mr.

feel
very
much
as
if
the
air

be
clear
of
obtrusive
fly
now

be
out

there

he

Mr.

he

tongue
that

supplement

that
way

have
remain

rather
an
inarticulate
condition

<EOS>
and
now
the

go

they
could
carry
on
their
serious
talk
without
frivolous
interruption

<EOS>
They
could
exchange
their
view
concern
the
Duke
of
Wellington
,
whose
conduct
in
the
Catholic
Question
have
throw
such
an
entirely
new
light
on
his
character
;
and
speak
slightingly
of
his
conduct
at
the
battle
of
Waterloo
,
which
he
would
never
have
win
if
there
have
not
be
a
great
many
englishman
at
his
back
,
not
to
speak
of
Blucher
and
the
Prussians
,
who
,
as
Mr.

have
hear
from
a
person
of
particular
knowledge
in
that
matter
,
have
come
up
in
the
very
nick
of
time
;
though
here
there
be
a
slight
dissidence
,
Mr.
Deane
remark
that
he
be
not
dispose
to
give
much
credit
to
the
Prussians
,
 
the
build
of
their
vessel
,
together
with
the
unsatisfactory
character
of
transaction
in
Dantzic
beer
,
incline
him
to
form
rather
a
low
view
of
prussian
pluck
generally
.
<EOS>
rather
beat
on
this
ground
,
Mr.
Tulliver
proceed
to
express
his
fear
that
the
country
could
never
again
be
what
it
use
to
be
;
but
Mr.
Deane
,
attach
to
a
firm
of
which
the
return
be
on
the
increase
,
naturally
take
a
more
lively
view
of
the
present
,
and
have
some
detail
to
give
concern
the
state
of
the
import
,
especially
in
hide
and
spelter
,
which
soothe
Mr.
Tulliver
's
imagination
by
throw
into
more
distant
perspective
the
period
when
the
country
would
become
utterly
the
prey
of
Papists
and
Radicals
,
and
there
would
be
no
more
chance
for
honest
man
.
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Pullet
sit
by
and
listen
with
twinkle
eye
to
these
high
matter
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
understand
politic
himself
,
 
think
they
be
a
natural
gift
,
 
<EOS>
but
by
what
he
could
make
out
,
this
Duke
of
Wellington
be
no
well
than
he
should
be
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
show
His
Weaker
side
  
"
<EOS>
suppose
sister
Glegg
should
call
her
money
in
;
it
'
ud
be
very
awkward
for
you
to
have
to
raise
five
hundred
pound
now
,
"
say
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
her
husband
that
evening
,
as
she
take
a
plaintive
review
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
live
thirteen
year
with
her
husband
,
yet
she
retain
in
all
the
freshness
of
her
early
married
life
a
facility
of
say
thing
which
drive
him
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
one
she
desire
.
<EOS>
some
mind
be
wonderful
for
keep
their
bloom
in
this
way
,
as
a
patriarchal
goldfish
apparently
retain
to
the
last
its
youthful
illusion
that
it
can
swim
in
a
straight
line
beyond
the
encircle
glass
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
an
amiable
fish
of
this
kind
,
and
after
run
her
head
against
the
same
resist
medium
for
thirteen
year
would
go
at
it
again
to
-
day
with
undulled
alacrity
.
  
<EOS>
this
observation
of
her
tend
directly
to
convince
Mr.
Tulliver
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
awkward
for
him
to
raise
five
hundred
pound
;
and
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
become
rather
press
to
know
_
<EOS>
how
_
he
would
raise
it
without
mortgage
the
mill
and
the
house
which
he
have
say
he
never
_
would
<EOS>
_
mortgage
,
since
nowadays
people
be
none
so
ready
to
lend
money
without
security
,
Mr.
Tulliver
,
get
warm
,
declare
that
Mrs.
Glegg
may
do
as
she
like
about
call
in
her
money
,
he
should
pay
it
in
whether
or
not
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
go
to
be
behold
to
his
wife
's
sister
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
have
marry
into
a
family
where
there
be
a
whole
litter
of
woman
,
he
may
have
plenty
to
put
up
with
if
he
choose
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Tulliver
do
_
not
_
choose
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
cry
a
little
in
a
trickling
,
quiet
way
as
she
put
on
her
nightcap
;
but
presently
sink
into
a
comfortable
sleep
,
lull
by
the
thought
that
she
would
talk
everything
over
with
her
sister
Pullet
to
-
morrow
,
when
she
be
to
take
the
child
to
Garum
Firs
to
tea
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
look
forward
to
any
distinct
issue
from
that
talk
;
but
it
seem
impossible
that
past
event
should
be
so
obstinate
as
to
remain
unmodified
when
they
be
complain
against
.
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
lie
awake
rather
longer
,
for
he
too
be
think
of
a
visit
he
would
pay
on
the
morrow
;
and
his
idea
on
the
subject
be
not
of
so
vague
and
soothe
a
kind
as
those
of
his
amiable
partner
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
when
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
feeling
,
have
a
promptitude
in
action
that
may
seem
inconsistent
with
that
painful
sense
of
the
complicate
,
puzzle
nature
of
human
affair
under
which
his
more
dispassionate
deliberation
be
conduct
;
but
it
be
really
not
improbable
that
there
be
a
direct
relation
between
these
apparently
contradictory
phenomenon
,
since
I
have
observe
that
for
get
a
strong
impression
that
a
skein
be
tangle
there
be
nothing
like
snatch
hastily
at
a
single
thread
.
<EOS>
It
be
owe
to
this
promptitude
that
Mr.
Tulliver
be
on
horseback
soon
after
dinner
the
next
day
(
he
be
not
dyspeptic
)
on
his
way
to
Basset
to
see
his
sister
Moss
and
her
husband
.
<EOS>
for
have
make
up
his
mind
irrevocably
that
he
would
pay
Mrs.
Glegg
her
loan
of
five
hundred
pound
,
it
naturally
occur
to
him
that
he
have
a
promissory
note
for
three
hundred
pound
lend
to
his
brother
-
in
-
law
Moss
;
and
if
the
say
brother
-
in
-
law
could
manage
to
pay
in
the
money
within
a
give
time
,
it
would
go
far
to
lessen
the
fallacious
air
of
inconvenience
which
Mr.
Tulliver
's
spirited
step
may
have
wear
in
the
eye
of
weak
people
who
require
to
know
precisely
_
how
_
a
thing
be
to
be
do
before
they
be
strongly
confident
that
it
will
be
easy
.
  
<EOS>
for
Mr.
Tulliver
be
in
a
position
neither
new
nor
striking
,
but
,
like
other
every
-
day
thing
,
sure
to
have
a
cumulative
effect
that
will
be
feel
in
the
long
run
:
he
be
hold
to
be
a
much
more
substantial
man
than
he
really
be
.
<EOS>
and
as
we
be
all
apt
to
believe
what
the
world
believe
about
us
,
it
be
his
habit
to
think
of
failure
and
ruin
with
the
same
sort
of
remote
pity
with
which
a
spare
,
long
-
necked
man
hear
that
his
plethoric
short
-
necked
neighbor
be
stricken
with
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
always
use
to
hear
pleasant
joke
about
his
advantage
as
a
man
who
work
his
own
mill
,
and
own
a
pretty
bit
of
land
;
and
these
joke
naturally
keep
up
his
sense
that
he
be
a
man
of
considerable
substance
.
<EOS>
They
give
a
pleasant
flavor
to
his
glass
on
a
market
-
day
,
and
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
recurrence
of
half
-
yearly
payment
,
Mr.
Tulliver
would
really
have
forget
that
there
be
a
mortgage
of
two
thousand
pound
on
his
very
desirable
freehold
.
<EOS>
that
be
not
altogether
his
own
fault
,
since
one
of
the
thousand
pound
be
his
sister
's
fortune
,
which
he
have
to
pay
on
her
marriage
;
and
a
man
who
have
neighbor
that
_
will
_
go
to
law
with
him
be
not
likely
to
pay
off
his
mortgage
,
especially
if
he
enjoy
the
good
opinion
of
acquaintance
who
want
to
borrow
a
hundred
pound
on
security
too
lofty
to
be
represent

<EOS>
Our
friend
Mr.
Tulliver
have
a
good
-
natured
fibre
in
him
,
and
do
not
like
to
give
harsh
refusal
even
to
his
sister
,
who
have
not
only
come
in
to
the
world
in
that
superfluous
way
characteristic
of
sister
,
create
a
necessity
for
mortgage
,
but
have
quite
throw
herself
away
in
marriage
,
and
have
crown
her
mistake
by
have
an
eighth
baby
.
<EOS>
on
this
point
Mr.
Tulliver
be
conscious
of
be
a
little
weak
;
but
he
apologize
to
himself
by
say
that
poor
Gritty
have
be
a
good
-
look
wench
before
she
marry
Moss
;
he
would
sometimes
say
this
even
with
a
slight
tremulousness
in
his
voice
.
<EOS>
but
this
morning
he
be
in
a
mood
more
become
a
man
of
business
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
ride
along
the
Basset
lane
,
with
their
deep
rut
,
 
lie
so
far
away
from
a
market
-
town
that
the
labor
of
draw
produce
and
manure
be
enough
to
take
away
the
good
part
of
the
profit
on
such
poor
land
as
that
parish
be
make
of
,
 
he
get
up
a
due
amount
of
irritation
against
Moss
as
a
man
without
capital
,
who
,
if
murrain
and
blight
be
abroad
,
be
sure
to
have
his
share
of
them
,
and
who
,
the
more
you
try
to
help
him
out
of
the
mud
,
would
sink
the
further
in
.
<EOS>
It
would
do
him
good
rather
than
harm
,
now
,
if
he
be
oblige
to
raise
this
three
hundred
pound
;
it
would
make
him
look
about
him
better
,
and
not
act
so
foolishly
about
his
wool
this
year
as
he
do
the
last
;
in
fact
,
Mr.
Tulliver
have
be
too
easy
with
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
because
he
have
let
the
interest
run
on
for
two
year
,
Moss
be
likely
enough
to
think
that
he
should
never
be
trouble
about
the
principal
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Tulliver
be
determine
not
to
encourage
such
shuffling
people
any
longer
;
and
a
ride
along
the
Basset
lane
be
not
likely
to
enervate
a
man
's
resolution
by
soften
his
temper
.
<EOS>
the
deep
-
trodden
hoof
-
mark
,
make
in
the
muddy
day
of
winter
,
give
him
a
shake
now
and
then
which
suggest
a
rash
but
stimulate
snarl
at
the
father
of
lawyer
,
who
,
whether
by
mean
of
his
hoof
or
otherwise
,
have
doubtless
something
to
do
with
this
state
of
the
road
;
and
the
abundance
of
foul
land
and
neglect
fence
that
meet
his
eye
,
though
they
make
no
part
of
his
brother
Moss
's
farm
,
strongly
contribute
to
his
dissatisfaction
with
that
unlucky
agriculturist
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
not
Moss
's
fallow
,
it
may
have
be
;
Basset
be
all
alike
;
it
be
a
beggarly
parish
,
in
Mr.
Tulliver
's
opinion
,
and
his
opinion
be
certainly
not
groundless
.
<EOS>
Basset
have
a
poor
soil
,
poor
road
,
a
poor
non
-
resident
landlord
,
a
poor
non
-
resident
vicar
,
and
rather
less
than
half
a
curate
,
also
poor
.
<EOS>
if
any
one
strongly
impressed
with
the
power
of
the
human
mind
to
triumph
over
circumstance
will
contend
that
the
parishioner
of
Basset
may
nevertheless
have
be
a
very
superior
class
of
people
<EOS>
,
I
have
nothing
to
urge
against
that
abstract
proposition
;
I
only
know
that
,
in
point
of
fact
,
the
Basset
mind
be
in
strict
keep
with
its
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
muddy
lane
,
green
or
clayey
,
that
seem
to
the
unaccustomed
eye
to
lead
nowhere
<EOS>
but
into
each
other
,
do
really
lead
,
with
patience
,
to
a
distant
high
-
road
;
but
there
be
many
foot
in
Basset
which
they
lead
more
frequently
to
a
centre
of
dissipation
,
speak
of
formerly
as
the
"
Markis
o
'
Granby
,
"
but
among
intimate
as
"
Dickison
's
.
"
<EOS>
a
large
low
room
with
a
sanded
floor
;
a
cold
scent
of
tobacco

modify
by
undetected
beer

Mr.
Dickison
lean
against

post
with
a
melancholy
pimple
face
,
look
as
irrelevant
to
the
daylight
as
a
last
night

candle
,
 
all
this
may
not
seem
a
very
seductive
form
of
temptation
;
but
the
majority
of
man
in
Basset
find
it
fatally
alluring
when
encounter
on
their
road
toward
four
o'clock
on
a
wintry
afternoon
;
and
if
any
wife
in
Basset
wish
to
indicate
that
her
husband
be
not
a
pleasure
-
seek
man
,
she
could
hardly
do
it
more
emphatically
than
by
say
that
he
do
not
spend
a
shilling
at
Dickison
's
from
one
Whitsuntide
to
another
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
have
say
so
of

her

husband
more
than
once
,
when
her
brother
be
in
a
mood
to
find
fault
with
him
,
as
he
certainly
be
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
and
nothing
could
be
less
pacify
to
Mr.
Tulliver
than
the
behavior
of
the
farmyard
gate
,
which
he
no
sooner
attempt
to
push
open
with
his
riding
-
stick
than
it
act
as
gate
without
the
upper
hinge
be
know
to
do
,
to
the
peril
of
shin
,
whether
equine
or
human

<EOS>
He
be
about
to
get
down
and
lead
his
horse
through
the
damp
dirt
of
the
hollow
farmyard
,
shadow
drearily
by
the
large
half

timbere
building
,
up
to
the
long
line
of
tumble

down

on
a

;
but
the
timely
appearance
of
a
cowboy
save
him
that
frustration
of
a
plan
he
have
determine
on
,
 
namely
,
not
to
get
down
from
his
horse
during
this
visit
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
mean
to
be
hard
,
let
him
keep
in
his
saddle
and
speak
from
that
height
,
above
the
level
of
plead
eye
,
and
with
the
command
of
a
distant

<EOS>
Mrs.
Moss
hear
the
sound
of
the
horse

foot

and
,
when
her

ride
up
,
be
already
outside
the
kitchen
door
,
with
a
half

weary
smile
on

eyed
baby

<EOS>
Mrs.

bear
a

resemblance
to
her

baby

little

I

answer
the
brother

with
cool
deliberation
,
as
if
it
be
rather
too
forward
of
her
to
ask
that
question
.
<EOS>
She
know
at
once
that
her
brother
be
not
in
a
good
humor
;
he
never
call
her
Mrs.
Moss
except
when
he
be
angry
,
and
when
they
be
in
company
.
<EOS>
but
she
think
it
be
in
the
order
of
nature
that
people
who
be
poorly
off
should
be
snub

<EOS>
Mrs.

do
not

her
stand

if

have
be
one

in

instead

the
simple
,
she
could
have
think
of
nothing
more
likely
to
propitiate
her

this
praise

Maggie

<EOS>
He
seldom
find
any

it

usually

Maggie

Mrs.

and
so
the
respectable

Basset
lane
rather
more
puzzled
than
before
as
to
way
and
mean
,
but
still
with
the
sense
of
a
danger
escape

<EOS>
It
have
come
across
his
mind
that
if
he
be
hard
upon
his
sister
,
it
may
somehow
tend
to
make
Tom
hard
upon
Maggie
at
some
distant
day
,
when
her
father
be
no
longer
there
to
take
her
part
;
for
simple
people
,
like
our
friend
Mr.
Tulliver
,
be
apt
to
clothe
unimpeachable
feeling
in
erroneous
idea
,
and
this
be
his
confused
way
of
explain
to
himself
that
his
love
and
anxiety
for
"
the
little
wench
"
have
give
him
a
new
sensibility
toward
his
sister

to
Garum

<EOS>
while
the
possible

Maggie

she
herself
be
taste
only
the
bitterness
of
the
present

<EOS>
Childhood
have
no
foreboding

but
then
,
it
be
soothe
by
no

sorrow

<EOS>
the
fact

,
the
day
have
begin
ill
with
Maggie

<EOS>
the
pleasure
of
have
Lucy
to
look
at
,
and
the
prospect
of
the
afternoon
visit
to
Garum
Firs
,
where
she
would
hear
uncle
Pullet
's
musical
box
,
have
be
mar
as
early
as
eleven
o'clock
by
the
advent
of
the
hair

dresser
from
St.
Ogg

,
who
have
speak
in
the
severe
term
of
the
condition
in
which
he
have
find
her
hair
,
hold
up
one
jagged
lock
after
another
and
say
,
"
see
here
!
<EOS>
tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
tone
of
mingle
disgust
and
pity
,
which
to
Maggie
's
imagination
be
equivalent
to
the
strong
expression
of
public
opinion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rappit
,
the
hair
-
dresser
,
with
his
well
-
anoint
coronal
lock
tend
wavily
upward
,
like
the
simulated
pyramid
of
flame
on
a
monumental
urn

seem
to
her
at
that
moment
the
most
formidable
of
her
contemporary
,
into
whose
street
at
St.
Ogg

she
would
carefully
refrain
from
enter
through
the
rest
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
moreover
,
the
preparation
for
a
visit
be
always
a
serious
affair
in
the
Dodson
family
,
Martha
be
enjoin
to
have
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
room
ready
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
,
that
the
laying
out
of
the
good
clothe
may
not
be
defer
till
the
last
moment
,
as
be
sometimes
the
case
in
family
of
lax
view
,
where
the
ribbon
-
string
be
never
roll
up
,
where
there
be
little
or
no
wrapping
in
silver
paper
,
and
where
the
sense
that
the
Sunday
clothe
could
be
get
at
quite
easily
produce
no
shock
to
the
mind

<EOS>
already
,
at
twelve
o'clock
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
on
her
visit
costume
,
with
a
protective
apparatus
of
brown
holland
,
as
if
she
have
be
a
piece
of
satin
furniture
in
danger
of
fly

Maggie

frown
and
twist
her
shoulder
,
that
she
may
if
possible
shrink
away
from
the
prickliest
of
tucker
,
while
her
mother
be
remonstrate
,
"
do
not
,
Maggie
,
my
dear
;
do
not
make
yourself
so
ugly

<EOS>
and
Tom
's
cheek
be
look
particularly
brilliant
as
a
relief
to
his
good
blue
suit
,
which
he
wear
with
become
calmness
,
have
,
after
a
little
wrangling
,
effect
what
be
always
the
one
point
of
interest
to
him
in
his
toilet
:
he
have
transfer
all
the
content
of
his
every

day
pocket
to
those
actually
in
wear
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Lucy
,
she
be
just
as
pretty
and
neat
as
she
have
be
yesterday
;
no
accident
ever
happen
to
her
clothe
,
and
she
be
never
uncomfortable
in
them
,
so
that
she
look
with
wonder
pity
at
Maggie
,
pouting
and
writhing
under
the
exasperate
tucker
.
<EOS>
Maggie
would
certainly
have
tear
it
off
,
if
she
have
not
be
check
by
the
remembrance
of
her
recent
humiliation
about
her
hair
;
as
it
be
,
she
confine
herself
to
fret
and
twist
,
and
behave
peevishly
about
the
card
-
house
which
they
be
allow
to
build
till
dinner
,
as
a
suitable
amusement
for
boy
and
girl
in
their
good
clothe
.
<EOS>
Tom
could
build
perfect
pyramid
of
house
;
but
Maggie
's
would
never
bear
the
laying
on
the
roof
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
so
with
the
thing
that
Maggie
make
;
and
Tom
have
deduce
the
conclusion
that
no
girl
could
ever
make
anything
.
<EOS>
but
it
happen
that
Lucy
prove
wonderfully
clever
at
building
;
she
handle
the
card
so
lightly
,
and
move
so
gently
,
that
Tom
condescend
to
admire
her
house
as
well
as
his
own
,
the
more
readily
because
she
have
ask
him
to
teach
her
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
too
,
would
have
admire
Lucy
's
house
,
and
would
have
give
up
her
own
unsuccessful
building
to
contemplate
them
,
without
ill
temper
,
if
her
tucker
have
not
make
her
peevish
,
and
if
Tom
have
not
inconsiderately
laugh
when
her
house
fall
,
and
tell
her
she
be
"
a
stupid

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
laugh
at
me

she
burst
out
angrily
;

I

<EOS>
I

Maggie

start
up
hurriedly
from
her
place
on

floor

upset
Tom

wonderful
pagoda

<EOS>
She
really
do
not

it

but
the
circumstantial
evidence
be
against
her

and
Tom
turn
white
with
anger
,
but
say
nothing
;
he
would
have
strike
her
,
only
he
know
it
be
cowardly
to
strike
a

Tom
Tulliver
be
quite
determined
he
would

anything
cowardly

Maggie

terror

from

scattered
ruin

Lucy

like

"

two

three
hard

shoot
them
with
his

vaguely
at

but
presently
with
the
distinct
aim
of
hit
a
superannuated
blue

bottle
which
be
expose
its
imbecility
in
the
spring
sunshine
,
clearly
against
the
view
of
Nature

who

Tom
and
the
pea
for
the
speedy
destruction
of
this
weak

thus
the

He

Lucy

the

of

opportunely
spread
his
tail
on
the
stackyard
wall

just
as
they

Garum

be
enough
to
divert
the
mind
temporarily
from
personal
grievance

<EOS>
and
this
be
only
the

beautiful

nothing
be
quite
common
at
Garum
Firs
;
and
Tom
think
that
the
unusual
size
of
the
toad
there
be
simply
due
to
the
general
unusualness
which
characterize
uncle
Pullet

possession
as

<EOS>
toad

Uncle

Aunt

Mrs.

Tom

He
feel
it

visit
at
aunt

where
he
have
once
be
compel
to
sit
with
towel
wrap
round
his
boot

a
fact
which
may
serve
to
correct
the
too

hasty
conclusion
that
a
visit
to
Garum
Firs
must
have
be
a
great
treat
to
a
young

fond
of

the

disagreeable
be

it
be
the
mounting
of
the
polished
oak
stair
,
which
have
very
handsome
carpet
roll
up
and
lay
by
in
a
spare
bedroom
,
so
that
the
ascent
of
these
glossy

may
have
serve
,
in
barbarous
time
,
as
a
trial
by
ordeal
from
which
none

off
with
unbroken

<EOS>
Sophy

weakness
about
these
polished
stair
be
always
a
subject
of
bitter
remonstrance
on
Mrs.

part

but
Mrs.

venture
on
no
comment
,
only
think
to
herself
it
be
a
mercy
when
she

<EOS>
"
Mrs.

It

"
say
Mrs.

,
draw
a
bunch

key
from

look
at

earnestly

it

away
without

<EOS>
there

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.

shake

slowly
at

serious

which
determine
her

<EOS>
"
I
be

out

Mrs.

I

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
rise
with
a
melancholy
air
and
unlock
one
wing
of
a
very
bright
wardrobe
,
where
you
may
have
hastily
suppose
she
would
find
a
new
bonnet
.
<EOS>
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
such
a
supposition
could
only
have
arise
from
a
too
-
superficial
acquaintance
with
the
habit
of
the
Dodson
family
.
<EOS>
in
this
wardrobe
Mrs.
Pullet
be
seek
something
small
enough
to
be
hide
among
layer
of
linen
,
 
it
be
a
door
-
key
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
with
me
into
the
good
room
,
"
say
Mrs.
Pullet
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
the

come
too
,
sister

"
<EOS>
inquire
Mrs.

,
who
see
that
Maggie

Lucy

look
rather
eager
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
aunt
Pullet
,
reflectively
,
"
<EOS>
it
will
perhaps
be
safe
for
'em
to
come
;
they
will
be
touch
something
if
we
leave
'em
behind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
they
go
in
procession
along
the
bright
and
slippery
corridor
,
dimly
light
by
the
semi
-
lunar
top
of
the
window
which
rise
above
the
closed
shutter
;
it
be
really
quite
solemn
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
pause
and
unlock
a
door
which
open
on
something
still
more
solemn
than
the
passage
,
 
a
darkened
room
,
in
which
the
outer
light

enter
feebly

show
what
look
like
the
corpse

everything

Lucy

heart
beat
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
half
-
open
the
shutter
and
then
unlock
the
wardrobe
,
with
a
melancholy
deliberateness
which
be
quite
in
keeping
with
the
funereal
solemnity
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
the
delicious
scent
of
rose

leave
that
issue
from
the
wardrobe
make
the
process
of
take
out
sheet
after
sheet
of
silver
paper
quite
pleasant
to
assist
at
,
though
the
sight
of
the
bonnet
at
last
be
an
anticlimax
to
Maggie
,
who
would
have
prefer
something
more
strikingly
preternatural
.
<EOS>
but
few
thing
could
have
be
more
impressive
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
She
look
all
round
it
in
silence
for
some
moment
,
and
then
say
emphatically
,
"
well
,
sister
,
I
will
never
speak
against
the
full
crown
again

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
concession
,
and
Mrs.

feel
it
;
she
feel
something
be
due
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
to
see
it
on

<EOS>
she

sadly

<EOS>
"
I

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

<EOS>
Mrs.

take
off
her

display
the
brown
silk
scalp
with
a
jut
promontory
of
curl
which
be
common
to
the
more
mature
and
judicious
woman
of
those
time
,
and
place
the
bonnet
on
her
head
,
turn
slowly
round
,
like
a
draper

lay

figure

that
Mrs.

may
miss
no
point

"

well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that

take
off

contemplatively

<EOS>
"
how
much
may

charge
you
for

"
say
Mrs.

,
whose

be
actively
engage
on
the
possibility

get
a
humble

<EOS>
Mrs.

screw
up

shake
her
head

and
then
whisper
,
"
Pullet
pay

he

She

"

<EOS>
She
maintain

they
have
all

begin

<EOS>
Mrs.

feel
that
she
ought
to
be
affect
,
but
she
be
a
woman
of
sparse
tear
,
stout
and
healthy

she
could
not
cry
so
much
as
her
sister
Pullet
do
,
and
have
often
feel
her
deficiency
at
funeral
.
<EOS>
Her
effort
to
bring
tear
into
her
eye
issue
in
an
odd
contraction
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
look
on
attentively
,
feel
that
there
be
some
painful
mystery
about
her
aunt
's
bonnet
which
she
be
consider
too
young
to
understand
;
indignantly
conscious
,
all
the
while
,
that
she
could
have
understand
that
,
as
well
as
everything
else
,
if
she
have
be
take
into
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
go
down
,
uncle
Pullet
observe
,
with
some
acuman
,
that
he
reckon
the
missis
have
be
show
her
bonnet
,
 
that
be
what
have
make
them
so
long
upstairs
.
<EOS>
with
Tom
the
interval
have
seem
still
longer
,
for
he
have
be
seat
in
irksome
constraint
on
the
edge
of
a
sofa
directly
opposite
his
uncle
Pullet
,
who
regard
him
with
twinkle
gray
eye
,
and
occasionally
address
him
as
"
young
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
young
sir
,
what
do
you
learn
at
school
?
<EOS>
"
be
a
standing
question
with
uncle
Pullet
;
whereupon
Tom
always
look
sheepish
,
rub
his
hand
across
his
face
,
and
answer
,
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
altogether
so
embarrassing
to
be
seat
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
uncle
Pullet
,
that
Tom
could
not
even
look
at
the
print
on
the
wall
,
or
the
flycage
,
or
the
wonderful
flower
-
pot
;
he
see
nothing
but
his
uncle
's
gaiter
.
<EOS>
not
that
Tom
be
in
awe
of
his
uncle
's
mental
superiority
;
indeed
,
he
have
make
up
his
mind
that
he
do
not
want
to
be
a
gentleman
farmer
,
because
he
should
not
like
to
be
such
a
thin
-
legged
,
silly
fellow
as
his
uncle
Pullet
,
 
a
molly
-
coddle
,
in
fact
.
<EOS>
a
boy
's
sheepishness
be
by
no
mean
a
sign
of
overmaster
reverence
;
and
while
you
be
make
encouraging
advance
to
him
under
the
idea
that
he
be
overwhelm
by
a
sense
of
your
age
and
wisdom
,
ten
to
one
he
be
think
you
extremely
queer
.
<EOS>
the
only
consolation
I
can
suggest
to
you
be
,
that
the
greek
boy
probably
think
the
same
of
Aristotle
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
you
have
master
a
restive
horse
,
or
thrash
a
drayman
,
or
have
get
a
gun
in
your
hand
,
that
these
shy
junior
feel
you
to
be
a
truly
admirable
and
enviable
character
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
be
quite
sure
of
Tom
Tulliver
's
sentiment
on
these
point
.
<EOS>
in
very
tender
year
,
when
he
still
wear
a
lace
border
under
his
outdoor
cap
,
he
be
often
observe
peep
through
the
bar
of
a
gate
and
make
minatory
gesture
with
his
small
forefinger
while
he
scold
the
sheep
with
an
inarticulate
burr
,
intend
to
strike
terror

now

Mr.

never
ride
anything
tall
than
a
low
pony
,
and
be
the
least
predatory
of
man
,
consider
firearm
dangerous
,
as
apt
to
go
off
of

by
nobody

<EOS>
so
that
Tom
be
not
without
strong
reason
when
,
in
confidential
talk
with
a
chum
,
he
have
describe
uncle
Pullet
as
a
nincompoop
,
take
care
at
the

time
to
observe
that
he
be
a
very

rich

"
  
<EOS>
the
only
alleviate
circumstance
in
a

with
uncle
Pullet
be
that
he
keep
a
variety
of
lozenge
and
peppermint

drop
about
his
person
,
and
when
at
a
loss
for
conversation
,
he
fill
up
the
void
by
propose
a
mutual
solace
of
this
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
like
peppermint
,
young
sir
?
"
<EOS>
require
only
a
tacit
answer
when
it
be
accompany
by
a
presentation
of
the
article
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
little
girl
suggest
to
uncle
Pullet
the
further
solace
of
small
sweet
-
cake
,
of
which
he
also
keep
a
stock
under
lock
and
key
for
his
own
private
eating
on
wet
day
;
but
the
three
child
have
no
sooner
got
the
tempting
delicacy
between
their
finger
,
than
aunt
Pullet
desire
them
to
abstain
from
eat
it
till
the
tray
and
the
plate
come
,
since
with
those
crisp
cake
they
would
make
the
floor
"
all
over
"
crumb
.
<EOS>
Lucy
do
not
mind
that
much
,
for
the
cake
be
so
pretty
<EOS>
,
she
think
it
be
rather
a
pity
to
eat
it
;
but
Tom
,
watch
his
opportunity
while
the
elder
be
talk
,
hastily
stow
it
in
his
mouth
at
two
bite
,
and
chew
it
furtively
.
<EOS>
as
for
Maggie
,
become
fascinate
,
as
usual
,
by
a
print
of
Ulysses
and
Nausicaa
,
which
uncle
Pullet
have
buy
as
a
"
pretty
scripture
thing
,
"
she
presently
let
fall
her
cake
,
and
in
an
unlucky
movement
crush
it
beneath
her
foot
,
 
a
source
of
so
much
agitation
to
aunt
Pullet
and
conscious
disgrace
to
Maggie
,
that
she
begin
to
despair
of
hear
the
musical
snuff
-
box
to
-
day
,
<EOS>
till
,
after
some
reflection
,
it
occur
to
her
that
Lucy
be
in
high
favor
enough
to
venture
on
ask
for
a
tune
.
<EOS>
so
she
whisper
to
Lucy
;
and
Lucy
,
who
always
do
what
she
be
desire
to
do
,
go
up
quietly
to
her
uncle
's
knee
,
and
blush
-
all
over
her
neck
while
she
finger
her
necklace
,
say
,
"
Will
you
please
play
us
a
tune
,
uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
think
it
be
by
reason
of
some
exceptional
talent
in
uncle
Pullet
that
the
snuff
-
box
play
such
beautiful
tune
,
and
indeed
the
thing
be
view
in
that
light
by
the
majority
of
his
neighbor
in
Garum
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Pullet
have
_
buy
_
the
box
,
to
begin
with
,
and
he
understand
wind
it
up
,
and
know
which
tune
it
be
go
to
play
beforehand
;
altogether
the
possession
of
this
unique
"
piece
of
music
"
be
a
proof
that
Mr.
Pullet
's
character
be
not
of
that
entire
nullity
which
may
otherwise
have
be
attribute
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
uncle
Pullet
,
when
entreat
to
exhibit
his
accomplishment
,
never
depreciate
it
by
a
too
-
ready
consent
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
about
it
,
"
be
the
answer
he
always
give
,
carefully
abstain
from
any
sign
of
compliance
till
a
suitable
number
of
minute
have
pass
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Pullet
have
a
programme
for
all
great
social
occasion
,
and
in
this
way
fence
himself
in
from
much
painful
confusion
and
perplexing
freedom
of
will
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
suspense
do
heighten
Maggie
's
enjoyment
when
the
fairy
tune
begin
;
for
the
first
time
she
quite
forget
that
she
have
a
load
on
her
mind
,
that
Tom
be
angry
with
her
;
and
by
the
time
"
Hush
,
ye
pretty
warble
choir
,
"
have
be
play
<EOS>
,
her
face
wear
that
bright
look
of
happiness
,
while
she
sit
immovable
with
her
hand
clasp
,
which
sometimes
comfort
her
mother
with
the
sense
that
Maggie
could
look
pretty
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
spite
of
her
brown
skin
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
magic
music
cease
,
she
jump
up
,
and
run
toward
Tom
,
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
say
,
"
oh
,
Tom
,
be
not
it
pretty
?
"
  
<EOS>
lest
you
should
think
it
show
a
revolt
insensibility
in
Tom
that
he
feel
any
new
anger
toward
Maggie
for
this
uncalled
-
for
and
,
to
him
,
inexplicable
caress
,
I
must
tell
you
that
he
have
his
glass
of
cowslip
wine
in
his
hand
,
and
that
she
jerk
him
so
as
to
make
him
spill
half
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
be
an
extreme
milksop
not
to
say
angrily
,
"
<EOS>
look
there
,
now
!
"
<EOS>
especially
when
his
resentment
be
sanction
,
as
it
be
,
by
general
disapprobation
of
Maggie
's
behavior
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
sit
still
,
Maggie
?
"
<EOS>
her
mother
say
peevishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
little

not
come
to

me
if
they
behave
in
that
way

<EOS>
"
why

you
be

uncle

<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
sit
down
again

with
the
music
all
chase
out
of
her
soul
,
and
the

all

Mrs.

there

It

Mrs.

what
can
I
do

Mrs.

"
<EOS>
Mr.

be
not
a

not

I
be
to
go
to
the
parson

get
by
heart
what
I
should
tell
my

and
I
be
sure
I
do
not

anything
about

all
that

<EOS>
I
could
never

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
be
like
me
in
that
,
Bessy
,
"
say
Mrs.

;
"
and
I
think
it

be
<EOS>
a
deal
more
become
o

Jane
if
she
would
have
that
pier

glass
rub
oftener
<EOS>
,
 
there
be
ever
so
many
spot
on

last

instead
o

dictating
to
folk
as
have
more
coming
in
than
she
ever
have
,
and
tell
'em
what
they
be
to
do
with
their
money

<EOS>
but
Jane
and
me
be
allays
contrairy
;
she
_
would
_
have
stripe
thing
,

I
like
spot
.
<EOS>
You
like
a
spot
too

i

that

<EOS>
"
  
"
yes

Sophy

Mrs.

"
I
remember
our

a
blue
ground

both
alike

I
have
get
a
bit

if
you
would

go

I

a

the
right
thing

ud
be
for
Tulliver
to
go
and
make
it
up
with

himself

say
he
be
sorry

Her

I
be

if
she
would
just
take
no
notice

it

Mrs.

,
you
perceive
,
be
not
aware
of
her

irrevocable
determination

at

such

exceed

<EOS>
"

I

no

Mr.

who

perfectly
content

any
course
the
quarrel
may
take

so
that
Mr.

Mr.

be
nervous

could
have
any
security

<EOS>
after
a
little
further
discussion
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
well
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
to
accompany
them
on
a
visit
to
sister
Glegg
,
Mrs.
Pullet

observe
that
it
be
tea
-
time
,
turn
to
reach
from
a
drawer
a
delicate
damask
napkin
,
which
she
pin
before
her
in
the
fashion
of
an
apron
.
<EOS>
the
door
do
,
in
fact
,
soon
open
,
but
instead
of
the
tea
-
tray
,
Sally
introduce
an
object
so
startling
that
both
Mrs.
Pullet
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
give
a
scream
,
cause
uncle
Pullet
to
swallow
his
lozenge
 
for
the
fifth
time
in
his
life
,
as
he
afterward
note
.
    
<EOS>
Maggie
behave
bad
than
She
expect
  
the
startling
object
which
thus
make
an
epoch
for
uncle
Pullet
be
no
other
than
little
Lucy
,
with
one
side
of
her
person
,
from
her
small
foot
to
her
bonnet
-
crown
,
wet
and
discolor
with
mud
,
hold
out
two
tiny
blacken
hand
,
and
make
a
very
piteous
face
.
<EOS>
to
account
for
this
unprecedented
apparition
in
aunt
Pullet
's
parlor
,
we
must
return
to
the
moment
when
the
three
child
go
to
play
out
of
door
,
and
the
small
demon
who
have
take
possession
of
Maggie
's
soul
at
an
early
period
of
the
day
have
return
in
all
the
great
force
after
a
temporary
absence
.
<EOS>
all
the
disagreeable
recollection
of
the
morning
be
thick
upon
her
,
when
Tom
,
whose
displeasure
toward
her
have
be
considerably
refresh
by
her
foolish
trick
of
cause
him
to
upset
his
cowslip
wine
,
say
,
"
here
,
Lucy
,
you
come
along
with
me
,
"
and
walk
off
to
the
area
where
the
toad
be
,
as
if
there
be
no
Maggie
in
existence
.
<EOS>
see
this
,
Maggie
linger
at
a
distance
look
like
a
small
Medusa
with
her
snake
crop
.
<EOS>
Lucy
be
naturally
pleased
that
cousin
Tom
be
so
good
to
her
,
and
it
be
very
amusing
to
see
him
tickle
a
fat
toad
with
a
piece
of
string
when
the
toad
be
safe
down
the
area
,
with
an
iron
grating
over
him
.
<EOS>
still
Lucy
wish
Maggie
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
also
,
especially
as
she
would
doubtless
find
a
name
for
the
toad
,
and
say
what
have
be
his
past
history
;
for
Lucy
have
a
delighted
semibelief
in
Maggie
's
story
about
the
live
thing
they
come
upon
by
accident
,
 
how
Mrs.
Earwig
have
a
wash
at
home
,
and
one
of
her
child
have
fall
into
the
hot
copper
,
for
which
reason
she
be
run
so
fast
to
fetch
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Tom
have
a
profound
contempt
for
this
nonsense
of
Maggie
's
,
smash
the
earwig
at
once
as
a
superfluous
yet
easy
mean
of
prove
the
entire
unreality
of
such
a
story
;
but
Lucy
,
for
the
life
of
her
,
could
not
help
fancy
there
be
something
in
it
,
and
at
all
event
think
it
be
very
pretty
make
-
believe
.
<EOS>
so
now
the
desire
to
know
the
history
of
a
very
portly
toad
,
add
to
her
habitual
affectionateness
,
make
her
run
back
to
Maggie
and
say
,
"
oh
,
there
be
such
a
big
,
funny
toad
,
Maggie
!
<EOS>
do
come
and
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
say
nothing
,
but
turn
away
from
her
with
a
deep
frown
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
Tom
seem
to
prefer
Lucy
to
her
,
Lucy
make
part
of
his
unkindness
.
<EOS>
Maggie
would
have
think
a
little
while
ago
that
she
could
never
be
cross
with
pretty
little
Lucy
,
any
more
than
she
could
be
cruel
to
a
little
white
mouse
;
but
then
,
Tom
have
always
be
quite
indifferent
to
Lucy
before
,
and
it
have
be
leave
to
Maggie
to
pet
and
make
much
of
her
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
be
actually
begin
to
think
that
she
should
like
to
make
Lucy
cry
by
slap
or
pinch
her
,
especially
as
it
may
vex
Tom
,
whom
it
be
of
no
use
to
slap
,
even
if
she
dare
,
because
he
do
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
and
if
Lucy
have
not
be
there
,
Maggie
be
sure
he
would
have
get
friend
with
her
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
tickle
a
fat
toad
who
be
not
highly
sensitive
be
an
amusement
that
it
be
possible
to
exhaust
,
and
Tom
by
and
by
begin
to
look
round
for
some
other
mode
of
pass
the
time
.
<EOS>
but
in
so
prim
a
garden
,
where
they
be
not
to
go
off
the
pave
walk
,
there
be
not
a
great
choice
of
sport
.
<EOS>
the
only
great
pleasure
such
a
restriction
suggest
be
the
pleasure
of
break
it
,
and
Tom
begin
to
meditate
an
insurrectionary
visit
to
the
pond
,
about
a
field
's
length
beyond
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Lucy
,
"
he
begin
,
nod
his
head
up
and
down
with
great
significance
,
as
he
coil
up
his
string
again
,
"
what
do
you
think
I
mean
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
Tom
?
"
say
Lucy
,
with
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
go
to
the
pond
and
look
at
the
pike
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
with
me
if
you
like
,
"
say
the
young
sultan
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Tom
,
_
dare
_
you
?
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aunt
say
we
must
not
go
out
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
shall
go
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
,
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
nobody
"
ull
see
us
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
do
not
care
if
they
do
,
 
I
will
run
off
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
_
I
_
could
not
run
,
"
say
Lucy
,
who
have
never
before
be
expose
to
such
severe
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
never
mind
;
they
will
not
be
cross
with
_
you
_
,
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
say
I
take
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
walk
along
,
and
Lucy
trot
by
his
side
,
timidly
enjoy
the
rare
treat
of
do
something
naughty
,
 
excite
also
by
the
mention
of
that
celebrity
,
the
pike
,
about
which
she
be
quite
uncertain
whether
it
be
a
fish
or
a
fowl
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
see
them
leave
the
garden
,
and
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
follow
.
<EOS>
anger
and
jealousy
can
no
more
bear
to
lose
sight
of
their
object
than
love
,
and
that
Tom
and
Lucy
should
do
or
see
anything
of
which
she
be
ignorant
would
have
be
an
intolerable
idea
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
so
she
keep
a
few
yard
behind
them
,
unobserved
by
Tom
,
who
be
presently
absorb
in
watch
for
the
pike
,
 
a
highly
interesting
monster
;
he
be
say
to
be
so
very
old
,
so
very
large
,
and
to
have
such
a
remarkable
appetite
.
<EOS>
the
pike
,
like
other
celebrity
,
do
not
show
when
he
be
watch
for
,
but
Tom
catch
sight
of
something
in
rapid
movement
in
the
water
,
which
attract
him
to
another
spot
on
the
brink
of
the
pond
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Lucy
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
in
a
loud
whisper
,
"
come
here
!
<EOS>
take
care
!
<EOS>
keep
on
the
grass
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
step
where
the
cow
have
be
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
point
to
a
peninsula
of
dry
grass
,
with
trodden
mud
on
each
side
of
it
;
for
Tom
's
contemptuous
conception
of
a
girl
include
the
attribute
of
be
unfit
to
walk
in
dirty
place
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
come
carefully
as
she
be
bidden
,
and
bend
down
to
look
at
what
seem
a
golden
arrow
-
head
dart
through
the
water
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
water
-
snake
,
Tom
tell
her
;
and
Lucy
at
last
could
see
the
serpentine
wave
of
its
body
,
very
much
wonder
that
a
snake
could
swim
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
draw
nearer
and
nearer
;
she
_
must
_
see
it
too
,
though
it
be
bitter
to
her
,
like
everything
else
,
since
Tom
do
not
care
about
her
see
it
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
be
close
by
Lucy
;
and
Tom
,
who
have
be
aware
of
her
approach
,
but
would
not
notice
it
till
he
be
oblige
,
turn
round
and
say
,
    
"
now
,
get
away
,
Maggie
;
there
be
no
room
for
you
on
the
grass
here
.
<EOS>
nobody
ask
_
you
_
to
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
passion
at
war
in
Maggie
at
that
moment
to
have
make
a
tragedy
,
if
tragedy
be
make
by
passion
only
;
but
the
essential
[
greek
text
]
which
be
present
in
the
passion
be
want
to
the
action
;
the
utmost
Maggie
could
do
,
with
a
fierce
thrust
of
her
small
brown
arm
,
be
to
push
poor
little
pink
-
and
-
white
Lucy
into
the
cow
-
trodden
mud
.
  
<EOS>
then
Tom
could
not
restrain
himself
,
and
give
Maggie
two
smart
slap
on
the
arm
as
he
run
to
pick
up
Lucy
,
who
lie
cry
helplessly
.
<EOS>
Maggie
retreat
to
the
root
of
a
tree
a
few
yard
off
,
and
look
on
impenitently
.
<EOS>
usually
her
repentance
come
quickly
after
one
rash
deed
,
but
now
Tom
and
Lucy
have
make
her
so
miserable
,
she
be
glad
to
spoil
their
happiness
,
 
glad
to
make
everybody
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
be
sorry
?
<EOS>
Tom
be
very
slow
to
forgive
_
her
_
,
however
sorry
she
may
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
tell
mother
,
you
know
,
Miss
Mag
,
"
say
Tom
,
loudly
and
emphatically
,
as
soon
as
Lucy
be
up
and
ready
to
walk
away
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Tom
's
practice
to
"
tell
,
"
but
here
justice
clearly
demand
that
Maggie
should
be
visit
with
the
utmost
punishment
;
not
that
Tom
have
learn
to
put
his
view
in

She

she

Tom

Mrs.

be
mute

a

wretched

usual
,
the
thought
press
upon
her
that
people
would
think
she
have
do
something
wicked
to
deserve
her
maternal
trouble
,
while
Mrs.

begin
to
give
elaborate
direction
to
Sally
how
to
guard
the

serious

<EOS>
meantime
tea

in

<EOS>
Mrs.

go
out
to
speak
to
these
naughty

suppose
them
to
be
close
at

but
it
be
not
until
after
some
search
that
she
find
Tom
lean
with
rather
a
hardened
,
careless
air
against
the
white
paling
of
the
poultry
-
yard
,
and
lower
his
piece
of
string
on
the

a

exasperate
the

<EOS>
"
Tom

you
naughty

where

Mrs.

,
in

distressed
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Tom
;
his
eagerness
for
justice
on
Maggie
have
diminish
since
he
have
see
clearly
that
it
could
hardly
be
bring
about
without
the
injustice
of
some
blame
on
his
own
conduct

<EOS>
"
why
,
where
do
you
leave
her
?
"
say
the
mother
,
look
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
under

against

Tom
,
apparently
indifferent
to
everything

the
string

the
turkey

cock

<EOS>
"
then
go
and
fetch
her
in
this
minute

you
naughty

<EOS>
and
how
could
you

o

go
to
the
pond
,

take
your

where
there

<EOS>
You
know
she
will
do
mischief
if
there
be
mischief
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
way
,
if
she
blame
Tom
,
to
refer
his
misdemeanor
,
somehow
or
other
,
to
Maggie

<EOS>
the
idea
of
Maggie
sit
alone
by
the
pond
rouse
an
habitual
fear
in
Mrs.

mind
,
and
she
mount
the
horse

block
to
satisfy
herself
by
a
sight
of
that
fatal
child
,
while
Tom
walk
 
not
very
quickly
 
on
his
way
toward
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
such
child
for
the
water

mine
be
,
"
she
say
aloud
,
without
reflect
that
there
be
no
one
to

her

"
they

be
bring

dead
and
drownde
some
day

<EOS>
I
wish
that
river

far
enough

<EOS>
but
when
she
not
only
fail
to
discern
Maggie
,
but
presently
see
Tom
return
from
the
pool
alone
,
this
hovering
fear
enter
and
take
complete
possession
of
her
,
and
she
hurry
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
be
nowhere

mother

Tom

she

go
away

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
You
may
conceive
the
terrified
search
for
Maggie
,
and
the
difficulty
of
convince
her
mother
that
she
be
not
in
the
pond
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
observe
that
the
child
may
come
to
a
bad
end
<EOS>
if
she
live
,
there
be
no
knowing
;
and
Mr.
Pullet
,
confused
and
overwhelm
by
this
revolutionary
aspect
of
thing
,
 
the
tea
defer
and
the
poultry
alarm
by
the
unusual
running
to
and
fro
,
 
take
up
his
spud
as
an
instrument
of
search
,
and
reach
down
a
key
to
unlock
the
goose
-
pen
,
as
a
likely
place
for
Maggie
to
lie
conceal
in
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
after
a
while
,
start
the
idea
that
Maggie
be
go
home
(
without
think
it
necessary
to
state
that
it
be
what
he
should
have
do
himself
under
the
circumstance
)
,
and
the
suggestion
be
seize
as
a
comfort
by
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sister
,
for
goodness
'
sake
let
'em
put
the
horse
in
the
carriage
and
take
me
home
;
we
shall
perhaps
find
her
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
Lucy
can
not
walk
in
her
dirty
clothe
,
"
she
say
,
look
at
that
innocent
victim
,
who
be
wrap
up
in
a
shawl
,
and
sit
with
naked
foot
on
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
Aunt
Pullet
be
quite
willing
to
take
the
short
mean
of
restore
her
premise
to
order
and
quiet
,
and
it
be
not
long
before
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
in
the
chaise
,
look
anxiously
at
the
most
distant
point
before
her
.
<EOS>
what
the
father
would
say
if
Maggie
be
lose
,
be
a
question
that
predominate
over
every
other
.
    
<EOS>
Maggie
try
to
run
away
from
Her
Shadow
  
Maggie
's
intention
,
as
usual
,
be
on
a
large
scale
than
Tom
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
resolution
that
gather
in
her
mind
,
after
Tom
and
Lucy
have
walk
away
,
be
not
so
simple
as
that
of
go
home
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
she
would
run
away
and
go
to
the
gypsy
,
and
Tom
should
never
see
her
any
more
.
<EOS>
that
be
by
no
mean
a
new
idea
to
Maggie
;
she
have
be
so
often
tell
she
be
like
a
gypsy
,
and
"
half
wild
,
"
that
when
she
be
miserable
it
seem
to
her
the
only
way
of
escape
opprobrium
,
and
be
entirely
in
harmony
with
circumstance
,
would
be
to
live
in
a
little
brown
tent
on
the
common
;
the
gypsy
,
she
consider
,
would
gladly
receive
her
and
pay
her
much
respect
on
account
of
her
superior
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
have
once
mention
her
view
on
this
point
to
Tom
and
suggest
that
he
should
stain
his
face
brown
,
and
they
should
run
away
together
;
but
Tom
reject
the
scheme
with
contempt
,
observe
that
gypsy
be
thief
,
and
hardly
get
anything
to
eat
and
have
nothing
to
drive
but
a
donkey
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
however
,
Maggie
think
her
misery
have
reach
a
pitch
at
which
gypsydom
be
her
refuge
,
and
she
rise
from
her
seat
on
the
root
of
the
tree
with
the
sense
that
this
be
a
great
crisis
in
her
life
;
she
would
run
straight
away
till
she
come
to
Dunlow
Common
,
where
there
would
certainly
be
gypsy
;
and
cruel
Tom
,
and
the
rest
of
her
relation
who
find
fault
with
her
,
should
never
see
her
any
more
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
her
father
as
she
run
along
,
but
she
reconcile
herself
to
the
idea
of
part
with
him
,
by
determine
that
she
would
secretly
send
him
a
letter
by
a
small
gypsy
,
who
would
run
away
without
tell
where
she
be
,
and
just
let
him
know
that
she
be
well
and
happy
,
and
always
love
him
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
soon
get
out
of
breath
with
running
,
but
by
the
time
Tom
get
to
the
pond
again
she
be
at
the
distance
of
three
long
field
,
and
be
on
the
edge
of
the
lane
lead
to
the
highroad
.
<EOS>
She
stop
to
pant
a
little
,
reflect
that
run
away
be
not
a
pleasant
thing
until
one
have
get
quite
to
the
common
where
the
gypsy
be
,
but
her
resolution
have
not
abate
;
she
presently
pass
through
the
gate
into
the
lane
,
not
know
where
it
would
lead
her
,
for
it
be
not
this
way
that
they
come
from
Dorlcote
Mill
to
Garum
Firs
,
and
she
feel
all
the
safe
for
that
,
because
there
be
no
chance
of
her
be
overtake
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
soon
aware
,
not
without
tremble
,
that
there
be
two
man
come
along
the
lane
in
front
of
her
;
she
have
not
think
of
meeting
stranger
,
she
have
be
too
much
occupy
with
the
idea
of
her
friend
come
after
her
.
<EOS>
the
formidable
stranger
be
two
shabby
-
look
man
with
flushed
face
,
one
of
them
carry
a
bundle
on
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
;
but
to
her
surprise
,
while
she
be
dread
their
disapprobation
as
a
runaway
,
the
man
with
the
bundle
stop
,
and
in
a
half
-
whine
,
half
-
coax
tone
ask
her
if
she
have
a
copper
to
give
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
a
sixpence
in
her
pocket
,
 
her
uncle
Glegg
's
present
,
 
which
she
immediately
draw
out
and
give
this
poor
man
with
a
polite
smile
,
hope
he
would
feel
very
kindly
toward
her
as
a
generous
person
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
only
money
I
have
get
,
"
she
say
apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
little
miss
,
"
say
the
man
,
in
a
less
respectful
and
grateful
tone
than
Maggie
anticipate
,
and
she
even
observe
that
he
smile
and
wink
at
his
companion
.
<EOS>
She
walk
on
hurriedly
,
but
be
aware
that
the
two
man
be
stand
still
,
probably
to
look
after
her
,
and
she
presently
hear
them
laugh
loudly
.
<EOS>
suddenly
it
occur
to
her
that
they
may
think
she
be
an
idiot
;
Tom
have
say
that
her
crop
hair
make
her
look
like
an
idiot
,
and
it
be
too
painful
an
idea
to
be
readily
forget
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
have
no
sleeve
on
,
 
only
a
cape
and
bonnet
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
she
be
not
likely
to
make
a
favorable
impression
on
passenger
,
and
she
think
she
would
turn
into
the
field
again
,
but
not
on
the
same
side
of
the
lane
as
before
,
lest
they
should
still
be
uncle
Pullet
's
field
.
<EOS>
She
turn
through
the
first
gate
that
be
not
lock
,
and
feel
a
delightful
sense
of
privacy
in
creep
along
by
the
hedgerow
,
after
her
recent
humiliating
encounter
.
<EOS>
She
be
use
to
wander
about
the
field
by
herself
,
and
be
less
timid
there
than
on
the
highroad
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
have
to
climb
over
high
gate
,
but
that
be
a
small
evil
;
she
be
get
out
of
reach
very
fast
,
and
she
should
probably
soon
come
within
sight
of
Dunlow
Common
,
or
at
least
of
some
other
common
,
for
she
have
hear
her
father
say
that
you
could
not
go
very
far
without
come
to
a
common
.
<EOS>
She
hope
so
,
for
she
be
get
rather
tired
and
hungry
,
and
until
she
reach
the
gypsy
<EOS>
there
be
no
definite
prospect
of
bread
and
butter
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
broad
daylight
,
for
aunt
Pullet
,
retain
the
early
habit
of
the
Dodson
family
,
take
tea
at
half
-
past
four
by
the
sun
,
and
at
five
by
the
kitchen
clock
;
so
,
though
it
be
nearly
an
hour
since
Maggie
start
,
there
be
no
gathering
gloom
on
the
field
to
remind
her
that
the
night
would
come
.
<EOS>
still
,
it
seem
to
her
that
she
have
be
walk
a
very
great
distance
indeed
,
and
it
be
really
surprising
that
the
common
do
not
come
within
sight
.
<EOS>
hitherto
<EOS>
she
have
be
in
the
rich
parish
of
Garum
,
where
be
a
great
deal
of
pasture
-
land
,
and
she
have
only
see
one
laborer
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
that
be
fortunate
in
some
respect
,
as
laborer
may
be
too
ignorant
to
understand
the
propriety
of
her
want
to
go
to
Dunlow
Common
;
yet
it
would
have
be
well
if
she
could
have
meet
some
one
who
would
tell
her
the
way
without
want
to
know
anything
about
her
private
business
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
the
green
field
come
to
an
end
,
and
Maggie
find
herself
look
through
the
bar
of
a
gate
into
a
lane
with
a
wide
margin
of
grass
on
each
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
such
a
wide
lane
before
,
and
,
without
her
know
why
,
it
give
her
the
impression
that
the
common
could
not
be
far
off
;
perhaps
it
be
because
she
see
a
donkey
with
a
log
to
his
foot
feed
on
the
grassy
margin
,
for
she
have
see
a
donkey
with
that
pitiable
encumbrance
on
Dunlow
Common
when
she
have
be
across
it
in
her
father
's
gig
.
<EOS>
She
creep
through
the
bar
of
the
gate
and
walk
on
with
new
spirit
,
though
not
without
haunt
image
of
Apollyon
,
and
a
highwayman
with
a
pistol
,
and
a
blink
dwarf
in
yellow
with
a
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
,
and
other
miscellaneous
danger
.
<EOS>
for
poor
little
Maggie
have
at
once
the
timidity
of
an
active
imagination
and
the
daring
that
come
from
overmaster
impulse
.
<EOS>
She
have
rush
into
the
adventure
of
seek
her
unknown
kindre
,
the
gypsy
;
and
now
she
be
in
this
strange
lane
,
she
hardly
dare
look
on
one
side
of
her
,
lest
she
should
see
the
diabolical
blacksmith
in
his
leathern
apron
grin
at
her
with
arm
akimbo
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
a
leaping
of
the
heart
that
she
catch
sight
of
a
small
pair
of
bare
leg
stick
up
,
foot
uppermost
,
by
the
side
of
a
hillock
;
they
seem
something
hideously
preternatural
,
 
a
diabolical
kind
of
fungus
;
for
she
be
too
much
agitate
at
the
first
glance
to
see
the
ragged
clothe
and
the
dark
shaggy
head
attach
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
boy
asleep
,
and
Maggie
trot
along
faster
and
more
lightly
,
lest
she
should
wake
him
;
it
do
not
occur
to
her
that
he
be
one
of
her
friend
the
gypsy
,
who
in
all
probability
would
have
very
genial
manner
.
<EOS>
but
the
fact
be
so
,
for
at
the
next
bend
in
the
lane
Maggie
actually
see
the
little
semicircular
black
tent
with
the
blue
smoke
rise
before
it
,
which
be
to
be
her
refuge
from
all
the
blighting
obloquy
that
have
pursue
her
in
civilized
life
.
<EOS>
She
even
see
a
tall
female
figure
by
the
column
of
smoke
,
doubtless
the
gypsy
-
mother
,
who
provide
the
tea
and
other
grocery
;
it
be
astonishing
to
herself
that
she
do
not
feel
more
delighted
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
startling
to
find
the
gypsy
in
a
lane
,
after
all
,
and
not
on
a
common
;
indeed
,
it
be
rather
disappointing
;
for
a
mysterious
illimitable
common
,
where
there
be
sand
-
pit
to
hide
in
,
and
one
be
out
of
everybody
's
reach
,
have
always
make
part
of
Maggie
's
picture
of
gypsy
life
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
,
however
,
and
think
with
some
comfort
that
gypsie
most
likely
know
nothing
about
idiot
,
so
there
be
no
danger
of
their
fall
into
the
mistake
of
set
her
down
at
the
first
glance
as
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
she
have
attract
attention
;
for
the
tall
figure
,
who
prove
to
be
a
young
woman
with
a
baby
on
her
arm
,
walk
slowly
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
Maggie
look
up
in
the
new
face
rather
tremblingly
as
it
approach
,
and
be
reassure
by
the
thought
that
her
aunt
Pullet
and
the
rest
be
right
when
they
call
her
a
gypsy
;
for
this
face
,
with
the
bright
dark
eye
and
the
long
hair
,
be
really
something
like
what
she
use
to
see
in
the
glass
before
she
cut
her
hair
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
lady
,
where
be
you
go
to
?
"
<EOS>
the
gypsy
say
,
in
a
tone
of
coax
deference
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
,
and
just
what
Maggie
expect
;
the
gypsy
see
at
once
that
she
be
a
little
lady
,
and
be
prepared
to
treat
her
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
any
farther
,
"
say
Maggie
,
feel
as
if
she
be
say
what
she
have
rehearse
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
stay
with
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
pretty
;
come
,
then
.
<EOS>
why
,
what
a
nice
little
lady
you
be
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
gypsy
,
take
her
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
Maggie
think
her
very
agreeable
,
but
wish
she
have
not
be
so
dirty
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
quite
a
group
round
the
fire
when
she
reach
it
.
<EOS>
an
old
gypsy
woman
be
seat
on
the
ground
nurse
her
knee
,
and
occasionally
poke
a
skewer
into
the
round
kettle
that
send
forth
an
odorous
steam
;
two
small
shock
-
head
child
be
lie
prone
and
rest
on
their
elbow
something
like
small
sphinx
;
and
a
placid
donkey
be
bend
his
head
over
a
tall
girl
,
who
,
lie
on
her
back
,
be
scratch
his
nose
and
indulge
him
with
a
bite
of
excellent
steal
hay
.
<EOS>
the
slant
sunlight
fall
kindly
upon
them
,
and
the
scene
be
really
very
pretty
and
comfortable
<EOS>
,
Maggie
think
,
only
she
hope
they
would
soon
set
out
the
tea
-
cup
.
<EOS>
everything
would
be
quite
charming
when
she
have
teach
the
gypsy
to
use
a
washing
-
basin
,
and
to
feel
an
interest
in
book
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
confusing
,
though
,
that
the
young
woman
begin
to
speak
to
the
old
one
in
a
language
which
Maggie
do
not
understand
,
while
the
tall
girl
,
who
be
feed
the
donkey
,
sit
up
and
stare
at
her
without
offer
any
salutation
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
old
woman
say
,
    
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
my
pretty
lady
,
be
you
come
to
stay
with
us
?
<EOS>
sit
ye
down
and
tell
us
where
you
come
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
just
like
a
story
;
Maggie
like
to
be
call
pretty
lady
and
treat
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
She
sit
down
and
say
,
    
"
I
be
come
from
home
because
I
be
unhappy
,
and
I
mean
to
be
a
gypsy
.
<EOS>
I
will
live
with
you
if
you
like
,
and
I
can
teach
you
a
great
many
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
such
a
clever
little
lady
,
"
say
the
woman
with
the
baby
sit
down
by
Maggie
,
and
allow
baby
to
crawl
;
"
and
such
a
pretty
bonnet
and
frock
,
"
she
add
,
take
off
Maggie
's
bonnet
and
look
at
it
while
she
make
an
observation
to
the
old
woman
,
in
the
unknown
language
.
<EOS>
the
tall
girl
snatch
the
bonnet
and
put
it
on
her
own
head
hind
-
foremost
with
a
grin
;
but
Maggie
be
determine
not
to
show
any
weakness
on
this
subject
,
as
if
she
be
susceptible
about
her
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
wear
a
bonnet
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
would
rather
wear
a
red
handkerchief
,
like
yours
"
(
look
at
her
friend
by
her
side
)
.
<EOS>
"
My
hair
be
quite
long
till
yesterday
,
when
I
cut
it
off
;
but
I
dare
say
it
will
grow
again
very
soon
,
"
she
add
apologetically
,
think
it
probable
the
gypsy
have
a
strong
prejudice
in
favor
of
long
hair
.
<EOS>
and
Maggie
have
forget
even
her
hunger
at
that
moment
in
the
desire
to
conciliate
gypsy
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
a
nice
little
lady
!
 
<EOS>
and
rich
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
live
in
a
beautiful
house
at
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
home
be
pretty
,
and
I
be
very
fond
of
the
river
,
where
we
go
fishing
,
but
I
be
often
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
like
to
bring
my
book
with
me
,
but
I
come
away
in
a
hurry
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
tell
you
almost
everything
there
be
in
my
book
<EOS>
,
I
have
read
them
so
many
time
,
and
that
will
amuse
you
.
<EOS>
and
I
can
tell
you
something
about
Geography
too
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
about
the
world
we
live
in
,
 
very
useful
and
interesting
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
about
Columbus
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
eye
have
begin
to
sparkle
and
her
cheek
to
flush
,
 
she
be
really
begin
to
instruct
the
gypsy
,
and
gain
great
influence
over
them
.
<EOS>
the
gypsy
themselves
be
not
without
amazement
at
this
talk
,
though
their
attention
be
divide
by
the
content
of
Maggie
's
pocket
,
which
the
friend
at
her
right
hand
have
by
this
time
empty
without
attract
her
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
where
you
live
,
my
little
lady
?
"
say
the
old
woman
,
at
the
mention
of
Columbus
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
"
say
Maggie
,
with
some
pity
;
"
Columbus
be
a
very
wonderful
man
,
who
find
out
half
the
world
,
and
they
put
chain
on
him
and
treat
him
very
badly
,
you
know
;
it
be
in
my
Catechism
of
Geography
,
but
perhaps
it
be
rather
too
long
to
tell
before
tea
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
want
my
tea
<EOS>
so
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
last
word
burst
from
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
with
a
sudden
drop
from
patronizing
instruction
to
simple
peevishness
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
she
be
hungry
,
poor
little
lady
,
"
say
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
give
her
some
o
'
the
cold
victual
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
walk
a
good
way
,
I
will
be
bind
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
where
be
your
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
Dorlcote
Mill
,
a
good
way
off
,
"
say
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
be
Mr.
Tulliver
,
but
we
must
not
let
him
know
where
I
be
,
else
he
will
fetch
me
home
again
.
<EOS>
where
do
the
queen
of
the
gypsy
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
do
you
want
to
go
to
her
,
my
little
lady
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
the
tall
girl
meanwhile
be
constantly
stare
at
Maggie
and
grin
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
certainly
not
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Maggie
,
"
I
be
only
think
that
if
she
be
not
a
very
good
queen
you
may
be
glad
when
she
die
,
and
you
could
choose
another

<EOS>
if
I
be
a
queen

I
would
be
a
very
good
queen
,
and
kind
to
everybody

"
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
bit
o
'
<EOS>
nice
victual
,
then
,
"
say
the
old
woman
,
hand
to
Maggie
a
lump
of
dry
bread
,
which
she
have
take
from
a
bag
of
scrap
,
and
a
piece
of
cold
bacon
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
Maggie
,
look
at
the
food
without
take
it
;
"
but
will
you
give
me
some
bread
-
and
-
butter
and
tea
instead
<EOS>
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
bacon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
get
no
tea
nor
butter
,
"
say
the
old
woman
,
with
something
like
a
scowl
,
as
if
she
be
get
tired
of
coax
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
a
little
bread
and
treacle
would
do
,
"
say
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
han't
get
no
treacle
,
"
say
the
old
woman
,
crossly
,
whereupon
there
follow
a
sharp
dialogue
between
the
two
woman
in
their
unknown
tongue
,
and
one
of
the
small
sphinx
snatch
at
the
bread
-
and
-
bacon
,
and
begin
to
eat
it
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
the
tall
girl
,
who
have
go
a
few
yard
off
,
come
back
,
and
say
something
which
produce
a
strong
effect
.
<EOS>
the
old
woman
,
seem
to
forget
Maggie
's
hunger
,
poke
the
skewer
into
the
pot
with
new
vigor
,
and
the
young
creep
under
the
tent
and
reach
out
some
platter
and
spoon
.
<EOS>
Maggie
tremble
a
little
,
and
be
afraid
the
tear
would
come
into
her
eye
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
tall
girl
give
a
shrill
cry
,
and
presently
come
run
up
the
boy
whom
Maggie
have
pass
as
he
be
sleep
,
 
a
rough
urchin
about
the
age
of
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
stare
at
Maggie
,
and
there
ensue
much
incomprehensible
chattering
.
<EOS>
She
feel
very
lonely
,
and
be
quite
sure
she
should
begin
to
cry
before
long
;
the
gypsy
do
not
seem
to
mind
her
at
all
,
and
she
feel
quite
weak
among
them
.
<EOS>
but
the
springing
tear
be
check
by
new
terror
,
when
two
man
come
up
,
whose
approach
have
be
the
cause
of
the
sudden
excitement
.
<EOS>
the
elder
of
the
two
carry
a
bag
,
which
he
fling
down
,
address
the
woman
in
a
loud
and
scold
tone
,
which
they
answer
by
a
shower
of
treble
sauciness
;
while
a
black
cur
run
bark
up
to
Maggie
,
and
throw
her
into
a
tremor
that
only
find
a
new
cause
in
the
curse
with
which
the
young
man
call
the
dog
off
,
and
give
him
a
rap
with
a
great
stick
he
hold
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
feel
that
it
be
impossible
she
should
ever
be
queen
of
these
people
,
or
ever
communicate
to
them
amusing
and
useful
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
both
the
man
now
seem
to
be
inquire
about
Maggie
,
for
they
look
at
her
,
and
the
tone
of
the
conversation
become
of
that
pacific
kind
which
imply
curiosity
on
one
side
and
the
power
of
satisfy
it
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
young
woman
say
in
her
previous
deferential
,
coax
tone
,
    
"
this
nice
little
lady
's
come
to
live
with
us
;
be
not
you
glad
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
very
glad
,
"
say
the
young
man
,
who
be
look
at
Maggie
's
silver
thimble
and
other
small
matter
that
have
be
take
from
her
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
return
them
all
except
the
thimble
to
the
young
woman
,
with
some
observation
,
and
she
immediately
restore
them
to
Maggie
's
pocket
,
while
the
man
seat
themselves
,
and
begin
to
attack
the
content
of
the
kettle
,
 
a
stew
of
meat
and
potato
,
 
which
have
be
take
off
the
fire
and
turn
out
into
a
yellow
platter
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
begin
to
think
that
Tom
must
be
right
about
the
gypsy
;
they
must
certainly
be
thief
,
unless
the
man
mean
to
return
her
thimble
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
She
would
willingly
have
give
it
to
him
,
for
she
be
not
at
all
attach
to
her
thimble
;
but
the
idea
that
she
be
among
thief
prevent
her
from
feel
any
comfort
in
the
revival

sweet

"
here

say
the
young
woman
,
hand
some
of
the
stew
on
a
brown
dish
with
an
iron
spoon
to
Maggie
,
who
,
remember
that
the
old
woman
have
seem
angry
with
her
for
not
like
the
bread
-
and
-
bacon
,
dare
not
refuse
the
stew

though
fear
have
chase
away
her
appetite

<EOS>
if
her
father
would
but
come
by
in
the
gig

take
her
up

<EOS>
or
even
if
Jack
the
Giantkiller

Mr.
Greatheart
,
or
St.
George
who
slay
the
dragon
on
the
half
-
penny
,
would
happen
to
pass
that
way
!
<EOS>
but
Maggie
think
with
a
sink
heart
that
these
hero
be
never
see
in
the
neighborhood
of
St.
Ogg
's
;
nothing
very
wonderful
ever
come
there

<EOS>
Maggie
Tulliver
,
you
perceive
,
be
by
no
mean
that
well
train
,
well
-
inform
young
person
that
a
small
female
of
eight
or
nine
necessarily
be
in
these
day
<EOS>
;
she
have
only
be
to
school
a
year
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
have
so
few
book
that
she
sometimes
read
the
dictionary
;
so
that
in
travel
over
her
small
mind
you
would
have
find
the
most
unexpected
ignorance
as
well
as
unexpected
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
inform
you
that
there
be
such
a
word
as
"
polygamy
,
"
and
be
also
acquaint
with
"
polysyllable
,
"
she
have
deduce
the
conclusion
that
"
poly
"
mean
"
many
"
;
but
she
have
have
no
idea
that
gypsy
be
not
well
supply
with
grocery
,
and
her
thought
generally
be
the
odd
mixture
of
clear
-
eyed
acuman
and
blind
dream
.
  
<EOS>
Her
idea
about
the
gypsy
have
undergo
a
rapid
modification
in
the
last
five
minute
.
<EOS>
from
have
consider
them
very
respectful
companion
,
amenable
to
instruction
,
she
have
begin
to
think
that
they
mean
perhaps
to
kill
her
as
soon
as
it
be
dark
,
and
cut
up
her
body
for
gradual
cooking
;
the
suspicion
cross
her
that
the
fierce
-
eyed
old
man
be
in
fact
the
Devil
,
who
may
drop
that
transparent
disguise
at
any
moment
,
and
turn
either
into
the
grin
blacksmith
,
or
else
a
fiery
-
eyed
monster
with
dragon
's
wing
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
try
to
eat
the
stew
,
and
yet
the
thing
she
most
dreaded
be
to
offend
the
gypsy
,
by
betray
her
extremely
unfavorable
opinion
of
them
;
and
she
wonder
,
with
a
keenness
of
interest
that
no
theologian
could
have
exceed
,
whether
,
if
the
Devil
be
really
present
,
he
would
know
her
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
like
the
smell
of
it
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
young
woman
,
observe
that
Maggie
do
not
even
take
a
spoonful
of
the
stew
.
<EOS>
"
try
a
bit
,
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

thank
you

"
say
Maggie
,
summon
all
her
force
for
a
desperate
effort
,
and
try
to
smile
in
a
friendly
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
time
,
I
think
;
it
seem
get
dark

<EOS>
I
think
I
must
go
home
now
,
and
come
again
another
day
,

then
I
can
bring
you
a
basket
with
some
jam

tart

thing

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
rise
from
her
seat
as
she
throw
out
this
illusory
prospect
,
devoutly
hope
that
Apollyon
be
gullible
;
but
her
hope
sink
when
the
old
gypsy
-
woman
say
,
"
stop
a

stop

we
will
take

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
sit
down
again
,
with
little
faith
in
this
promise
,
though
she
presently
see
the
tall
girl
put
a
bridle
on
the
donkey
,
and
throw
a
couple
of
bag
on
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
"

then

say
the
young

,
rise
,
and
lead
the

forward

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lift
Maggie
as
he
speak
,
and
set
her
on
the
donkey
.
<EOS>
She
feel
relieved
that
it
be
not
the
old
man
who
seem
to
be
go
with
her
,
but
she
have
only
a
tremble
hope
that
she
be
really
go
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
your
pretty
bonnet

"
say
the
young
woman
,
put
that
recently
despise
but
now
welcome
article
of
costume
on
Maggie
's
head
;
"
and
you
will
say
we
have
be
very
good
to
you
,
will
not
you
?
<EOS>
and
what
a
nice
little
lady
<EOS>
we
say
you
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
thank
you
,
"
say
Maggie
,
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
I
wish
you
would
go
with
me
too
.
"
<EOS>
She
think
anything
be
well
than
go
with
one
of
the
dreadful
man
alone
;
it
would
be
more
cheerful
to
be
murder
by
a
large
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
be
fond
o

_
me

the

<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
go
;
you
will
go
too
fast
for
me

"
  
<EOS>
It
now
appear
that
the
man
also
be
to
be
seat
on
the
donkey
,
hold
Maggie
before
him
,
and
she
be
as
incapable
of
remonstrate
against
this
arrangement
as
the
donkey
himself
,
though
no
nightmare
have
ever
seem
to
her
more
horrible
.
<EOS>
when
the
woman
have
pat
her
on
the
back
,
and
say
"
good
-
by
,
"
the
donkey
,
at
a
strong
hint
from
the
man
's
stick
,
set
off
at
a
rapid
walk
along
the
lane
toward
the
point
Maggie
have
come
from
an
hour
ago
,
while
the
tall
girl
and
the
rough
urchin
,
also
furnish
with
stick
,
obligingly
escort
them
for
the
first
hundred
yard
,
with
much
screaming
and
thwacking
.
  
<EOS>
not
Leonore
,
in
that
preternatural
midnight
excursion
with
her
phantom
lover
,
be
more
terrified
than
poor
Maggie
in
this
entirely
natural
ride
on
a
short
-
pace
donkey
,
with
a
gypsy
behind
her
,
who
consider
that
he
be
earn
half
a
crown
.
<EOS>
the
red
light
of
the
set
sun
seem
to
have
a
portentous
meaning
,
with
which
the
alarming
bray
of
the
second
donkey
with
the
log
on
its
foot
must
surely
have
some
connection
.
<EOS>
two
low
thatch
cottage
 
<EOS>
the
only
house
they
pass
in
this
lane
 
seem
to
add
to
its
dreariness
;
they
have
no
window
to
speak
of
,
and
the
door
be
closed
;
it
be
probable
that
they
be
inhabitate
by
witch
,
and
it
be
a
relief
to
find
that
the
donkey
do
not
stop
there
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
 
oh
,
sight
of
joy
!
 
<EOS>
this

the
long

to
an
end

open
on
a
broad
highroad

where
there
be
actually
a
coach
passing

<EOS>
and
there
be
a
finger

post
at

corner

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gypsy
really
mean
to
take
her
home
,
then
;
he
be
probably
a
good
man
,
after
all
,
and
may
have
be
rather
hurt
at
the
thought
that
she
do
not
like
come
with
him
alone
.
<EOS>
this
idea
become
strong
as
she
feel
more
and
more
certain
that
she
know
the
road
quite
well
,
and
she
be
consider
how
she
may
open
a
conversation
with
the
injure
gypsy
,
and
not
only
gratify
his
feeling
but
efface
the
impression
of
her
cowardice
,
when
,
as
they
reach
a
cross

road

<EOS>
Maggie
catch
sight
of
some
one
come
on

faced
horse

out

the
sudden
joy

almost
painful

and
before
her

reach
her

she
be
sob

<EOS>
Great
be
Mr.

"
why

he

check
his
horse

while
Maggie
slip
from

donkey
and
run
to
her

stirrup

as

ride
along

lay
her

<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
speak
his
mind
very
strongly
when
he
reach
home
that
evening
;
and
the
effect
be
see
in
the
remarkable
fact
that
Maggie
never
hear
one
reproach
from
her
mother
,
or
one
taunt
from
Tom
,
about
this
foolish
business
of
her
run
away
to
the
gypsy

<EOS>
Maggie
be
rather
awe

stricken
by
this
unusual
treatment

sometimes
think

be

wicked

Mr.

<EOS>
in
order
to
see
Mr.

Mrs.
Glegg
at
home

we
must
enter
the
town
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
 
that
venerable
town
with
the
red
flute
roof
and
the
broad
warehouse
gable
,
where
the
black
ship
unlade
themselves
of
their
burthen
from
the
far
north
,
and
carry
away
,
in
exchange
,
the
precious
inland
product
,
the
well
-
crush
cheese
and
the
soft
fleece
which
my
refined
reader
have
doubtless
become
acquaint
with
through
the
medium
of
the
good
classic
pastoral

<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
old
,
old
town
which
impress
one
as
a
continuation
and
outgrowth
of
nature
,
as
much
as
the
nest
of
the
bower

bird
or
the
wind
gallery
of
the
white
ant
;
a
town
which
carry
the
trace
of
its
long
growth
and
history
like
a
millennial
tree
,
and
have
spring
up
and
develop
in
the
same
spot
between
the
river
and
the
low
hill
from
the
time
when
the
roman
legion
turn
their
back
on
it
from
the
camp
on
the
hillside
,
and
the
long

haired
sea

king
come
up
the
river
and
look
with
fierce
,
eager
eye
at
the
fatness
of
the
land

It

a
town

familiar
with

there
fitfully

the
scene
of
his
youth
and
love

time

and
be
meet
by
the
gloomy
shadow

dreadful
heathen
Dane

stab
in

of
his
warrior
by
the

rise
on
autumn
evening
like

mist
from
his
tumulus

the
hill

and
hover
in
the
court
of
the
old
hall
by

river

side

the
spot

thus
miraculously
slay

It

Normans
who
begin

fine
old
hall
,
which
be
,
like
the
town

tell
of
the
thought
and
hand
of
widely
sunder
generation
;
but
it
be
all
so
old
that
we
look
with
love
pardon
at
its
inconsistency
,
and
be
well
content
that
they
who
build
the
stone
oriel
,
and
they
who
build
the
gothic
façade
and
tower
of
fine
small
brickwork
with
the
trefoil
ornament
,
and
the
window
and
battlement
define
with
stone

pull
down
the
ancient

be
a
remnant
of
the
original

the
patron
saint
of
this
ancient
town

of

history
I
possess
several
manuscript

I
incline

the
brief

it

one

still

Ogg
the

come
up

I

ferry
thee

ferry

there

around

so
that
she
shed
a

she

surely

the

<EOS>
the
mind

St.

do
not
look
extensively
before

after

<EOS>
It
inherit
a
long
past
without

and
have
no
eye
for
the

that

<EOS>
since
the

when
St.
Ogg
with
his
boat
and
the
Virgin
Mother
at
the
prow
have
be
see
on

so
many

the

be

people
could

<EOS>
still
less
change
it
;
the
Catholics
be
formidable
because
they
would
lay
hold

government

burn
man

not
because
any
sane

honest
parishioner
of
St.

could
be
bring

<EOS>
one
aged

remember
how
a
rude
multitude
have
be
sway
when
John

preach
in

market
;
but
for
a
long
while
it
have
not

expect
of
preacher
that

should
shake
the
soul
of
man

<EOS>
an
occasional
burst
of
fervor
in
Dissenting

on

of
infant
baptism
be
the
only
symptom

a
zeal
unsuite

sober

<EOS>
Protestantism
sit
at
ease

unmindful
of
schism
,
careless
of
proselytism
:
dissent
be
an
inheritance
along
with
a
superior
pew

a
business
connection

and
Churchmanship
only
wonder
contemptuously
at
Dissent
as
a
foolish
habit
that
clung
greatly
to
family
in
the
grocery
and
chandlere
line
,
though
not
incompatible
with
prosperous
wholesale
dealing

<EOS>
but
with
the
Catholic
Question
have
come
a
slight
wind
of
controversy
to
break
the
calm
:
the
elderly
rector
have
become
occasionally
historical
and
argumentative
;
and
Mr.
Spray
,
the
Independent
minister
,
have
begin
to
preach
political
sermon
,
in
which
he
distinguish
with
much
subtlety
between
his
fervent
belief
in
the
right
of
the
Catholics
to
the
franchise
and
his
fervent
belief
in
their
eternal
perdition

<EOS>
Most
of
Mr.
Spray

hearer
,
however

be
incapable

his
subtlety

and
many
old

fashioned
dissenter
be
much
pain
by
his
"
side
with
the
Catholics

;
while
other
think
he
have
better
let
politic
alone
.
<EOS>
public
spirit
be
not
hold
in
high
esteem
at
St.
Ogg

,
and
man
who
busy
themselves
with
political
question
be
regard
with
some
suspicion
,
as
dangerous
character
;
they
be
usually
person
who
have
little
or
no
business
of
their
own
to
manage

or
,
if
they
have

be

<EOS>
this

the
general
aspect

thing
at
St.

be
in
Mrs.

day
,
and
at
that
particular
period
in
her
family
history
when
she
have
have
her
quarrel
with
Mr.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
time
when
ignorance
be
much
more
comfortable
than
at
present
,
and
be
receive
with
all
the
honor
in
very
good
society
,
without
be
oblige
to
dress
itself
in
an
elaborate
costume
of
knowledge
;
a
time
when
cheap
periodical
be
not
,
and
when
country
surgeon
never
think
of
ask
their
female
patient
if
they
be
fond
of
reading
,
but
simply
take
it
for
grant
that
they
prefer
gossip
;
a
time
when
lady
in
rich
silk
gown
wear
large
pocket
,
in
which
they
carry
a
mutton
-
bone
to
secure
them
against
cramp
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
carry
such
a
bone
,
which
she
have
inherit
from
her
grandmother
with
a
brocaded
gown
that
would
stand
up
empty
,
like
a
suit
of
armor
,
and
a
silver
-
head
walking

stick
;
for
the
Dodson
family
have
be
respectable
for
many
generation
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
have
both
a
front
and
a
back
parlor
in
her
excellent
house
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
so
that
she
have
two
point
of
view
from
which
she
could
observe
the
weakness
of
her
fellow
-
being
,
and
reinforce
her
thankfulness
for
her
own
exceptional
strength
of
mind
.
<EOS>
from
her
front
window
she
could
look
down
the
Tofton
Road
,
lead
out
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
note
the
grow
tendency
to
"
gad
about
"
in
the
wife
of
man
not
retire
from
business
,
together
with
a
practice
of
wear
weave
cotton
stocking
,
which
open
a
dreary
prospect
for
the
come
generation
;
and
from
her
back
window
she
could
look
down
the
pleasant
garden
and
orchard
which
stretch
to
the
river
,
and
observe
the
folly
of
Mr.
Glegg
in
spend
his
time
among
"
them
flower
and
vegetable
.
"
<EOS>
for
Mr.
Glegg
,
have
retire
from
active
business
as
a
wool
-
stapler
for
the
purpose
of
enjoy
himself
through
the
rest
of
his
life
,
have
find
this
last
occupation
so
much
more
severe
than
his
business
,
that
he
have
be
drive
into
amateur
hard
labor
as
a
dissipation
,
and
habitually
relax
by
do
the
work
of
two
ordinary
gardener
.
<EOS>
the
economizing
of
a
gardener
's
wage
may
perhaps
have
induce
Mrs.
Glegg
to
wink
at
this
folly
,
if
it
be
possible
for
a
healthy
female
mind
even
to
simulate
respect
for
a
husband
's
hobby
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
well
known
that
this
conjugal
complacency
belong
only
to
the
weak
portion
of
the
sex
,
who
be
scarcely
alive
to
the
responsibility
of
a
wife
as
a
constituted
check
on
her
husband
's
pleasure
,
which
be
hardly
ever
of
a
rational
or
commendable
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
on
his
side
,
too
,
have
a
double
source
of
mental
occupation
,
which
give
every
promise
of
be
inexhaustible
.
<EOS>
on
the
one
hand
,
he
surprise
himself
by
his
discovery
in
natural
history
,
find
that
his
piece
of
garden
-
ground
contain
wonderful
caterpillar
,
slug
,
and
insect
,
which
,
so
far
as
he
have
hear
,
have
never
before
attract
human
observation
;
and
he
notice
remarkable
coincidence
between
these
zoological
phenomenon
and
the
great
event
of
that
time
,
 
as
,
for
example
,
that
before
the
burning
of
York
Minster
there
have
be
mysterious
serpentine
mark
on
the
leave
of
the
rise
-
tree
,
together
with
an
unusual
prevalence
of
slug
,
which
he
have
be
puzzle
to
know
the
meaning
of
,
until
it
flash
upon
him
with
this
melancholy
conflagration
.
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Glegg
have
an
unusual
amount
of
mental
activity
,
which
,
when
disengage
from
the
wool
business
,
naturally
make
itself
a
pathway
in
other
direction
.
)
<EOS>
and
his
second
subject
of
meditation
be
the
"
contrairiness
"
of
the
female
mind
,
as
typically
exhibit
in
Mrs.
Glegg
.
<EOS>
that
a
creature
make
 
in
a
genealogical
sense
 
out
of
a
man
's
rib
,
and
in
this
particular
case
maintain
in
the
high
respectability
without
any
trouble
of
her
own
,
should
be
normally
in
a
state
of
contradiction
to
the
bland
proposition
and
even
to
the
most
accommodating
concession
,
be
a
mystery
in
the
scheme
of
thing
to
which
he
have
often
in
vain
seek
a
clew
in
the
early
chapter
of
Genesis
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
have
choose
the
eld
Miss
Dodson
as
a
handsome
embodiment
of
female
prudence
and
thrift
,
and
be
himself
of
a
money
-
get
,
money
-
keeping
turn
,
have
calculate
on
much
conjugal
harmony
.
<EOS>
but
in
that
curious
compound
,
the
feminine
character
,
it
may
easily
happen
that
the
flavor
be
unpleasant
in
spite
of
excellent
ingredient
;
and
a
fine
systematic
stinginess
may
be
accompany
with
a
seasoning
that
quite
spoil
its
relish
.
<EOS>
now
,
good
Mr.
Glegg
himself
be
stingy
in
the
most
amiable
manner
;
his
neighbor
call
him
"
near
,
"
which
always
mean
that
the
person
in
question
be
a
lovable
skinflint
.
<EOS>
if
you
express
a
preference
for
cheese
-
paring
,
Mr.
Glegg
would
remember
to
save
them
for
you
,
with
a
good
-
natured
delight
in
gratify
your
palate
,
and
he
be
give
to
pet
all
animal
which
require
no
appreciable
keep
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
humbug
or
hypocrisy
about
Mr.
Glegg
;
his
eye
would
have
water
with
true
feeling
over
the
sale
of
a
widow
's
furniture
,
which
a
five
-
pound
note
from
his
side
pocket
would
have
prevent
;
but
a
donation
of
five
pound
to
a
person
"
in
a
small
way
of
life
"
would
have
seem
to
him
a
mad
kind
of
lavishness
rather
than
"
charity
,
"
which
have
always
present
itself
to
him
as
a
contribution
of
small
aid
,
not
a
neutralizing
of
misfortune
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Glegg
be
just
as
fond
of
save
other
people
's
money
as
his
own
;
he
would
have
ride
as
far
round
to
avoid
a
turnpike
when
his
expense
be
to
be
pay
for
him
,
as
when
they
be
to
come
out
of
his
own
pocket
,
and
be
quite
zealous
in
try
to
induce
indifferent
acquaintance
to
adopt
a
cheap
substitute
for
blacking
.
<EOS>
this
inalienable
habit
of
saving
,
as
an
end
in
itself
,
belong
to
the
industrious
man
of
business
of
a
former
generation
,
who
make
their
fortune
slowly
,
almost
as
the
tracking
of
the
fox
belong
to
the
harrier
,
 
it
constitute

that

<EOS>
a
man
with
an
affectionate
disposition
,
who
find
a
wife
to
concur
with
his
fundamental
idea
of
life
,
easily
come
to
persuade
himself
that
no
other
woman
would
have
suit
him
so
well
,

do
a
little
daily
snapping
and
quarrel
without
any
sense
of
alienation

<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
be
of
a
reflective
turn
,
and
no
longer
occupy
with
wool
,
have
much
wonder
meditation
on
the
peculiar
constitution
of
the
female
mind
as
unfold
to
him
in
his
domestic
life
;
and
yet
he
think
Mrs.
Glegg
's
household
way
a
model
for
her
sex
.
<EOS>
It
strike
him
as
a
pitiable
irregularity
in
other
woman
if
they
do
not
roll
up
their
table
-
napkin
with
the
same
tightness
and
emphasis
as
Mrs.
Glegg
do
,
if
their
pastry
have
a
less
leathery
consistence
,
and
their
damson
cheese
a
less
venerable
hardness
than
her
;
nay
,
even
the
peculiar
combination
of
grocery
and
druglike
odor
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
private
cupboard
impress
him
as
the
only
right
thing
in
the
way
of
cupboard
smell

<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
he
would
not
have
long
for
the
quarrelling
again
,
if
it
have
cease
for
an
entire
week
;
and
it
be
certain
that
an
acquiescent

mild
wife
would
have
leave
his
meditation
comparatively
jejune
and
barren
of
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
's
unmistakable
kind

heartedness
be
show
in
this

that
it
pain
him
more
to
see
his
wife
at
variance
with
other
,
 
even
with
Dolly
,
the
servant
,
 
than
to
be
in
a
state
of
cavil
with
her
himself
;
and
the
quarrel
between
her
and
Mr.
Tulliver
vex
him
so
much
that
it
quite
nullify
the
pleasure
he
would
otherwise
have
have
in
the
state
of
his
early
cabbage
,
as
he
walk
in
his
garden
before
breakfast
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
go
in
to
breakfast
with
some
slight
hope
that
,
now
Mrs.
Glegg
have
"
sleep
upon
it
,
"
her
anger
may
be
subdue
enough
to
give
way
to
her
usually
strong
sense
of
family
decorum
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
use
to
boast
that
there
have
never
be
any
of
those
deadly
quarrel
among
the
Dodsons
which
have
disgrace
other
family
;
that
no
Dodson
have
ever
be
"
cut
off
with
a
shilling
,
"
and
no
cousin
of
the
Dodsons
disown
;
as
,
indeed
,
why
should
they
be
?
<EOS>
for
they
have
no
cousin
who
have
not
money
out
at
use
,
or
some
house
of
their
own
,
at
the
very
least
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
evening
-
cloud
which
have
always
disappear
from
Mrs.
Glegg
's
brow
when
she
sit
at
the
breakfast
-
table
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
fuzzy
front
of
curl
;
for
as
she
occupy
herself
in
household
matter
in
the
morning
<EOS>
it
would
have
be
a
mere
extravagance
to
put
on
anything
so
superfluous
to
the
making
of
leathery
pastry
as
a
fuzzy
curled
front
.
<EOS>
by
half
-
past
ten
decorum
demand
the
front
;
until
then
Mrs.
Glegg
could
economize
it
,
and
society
would
never
be
any
the
wiser
.
<EOS>
but
the
absence
of
that
cloud
only
leave
it
more
apparent
that
the
cloud
of
severity
remain
;
and
Mr.
Glegg
,
perceive
this
,
as
he
sit
down
to
his
milkporridge
,
which
it
be
his
old
frugal
habit
to
stem
his
morning
hunger
with
,
prudently
resolve
to
leave
the
first
remark
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
l
,
to
so
delicate
an
article
as
a
lady
's
temper
,
the
slight
touch
should
do
mischief
.
<EOS>
People
who
seem
to
enjoy
their
ill
temper
have
a
way
of
keep
it
in
fine
condition
by
inflict
privation
on
themselves
.
<EOS>
that
be
Mrs.
Glegg
's
way
.
<EOS>
She
make
her
tea
weak
than
usual
this
morning
,
and
decline
butter
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
hard
case
that
a
vigorous
mood
for
quarrel
,
so
highly
capable
of
use
an
opportunity
,
should
not
meet
with
a
single
remark
from
Mr.
Glegg
on
which
to
exercise
itself
.
<EOS>
but
by
and
by
it
appear
that
his
silence
would
answer
the
purpose
,
for
he
hear
himself
apostrophize
at
last
in
that
tone
peculiar
to
the
wife
of
one
's
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"

Mr.

Mr.

pause
from

up

not
with

simply

but
Mrs.
Glegg
carry
something
else
up
-
stair
with
her
,
which
,
together
with
the
"
saint
'
rest
"
and
the
gruel
,
may
have
have
some
influence
in
gradually
calm
her
feeling
,
and
make
it
possible
for
her
to
endure
existence
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
shortly
before
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
partly
,
Mr.
Glegg
's
suggestion
that
she
would
do
well
to
let
her
five
hundred
lie
still
until
a
good
investment
turn
up
;
and
,
further
,
his
parenthetic
hint
at
his
handsome
provision
for
her
in
case
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
like
all
man
of
his
stamp
,
be
extremely
reticent
about
his
will
;
and
Mrs.
Glegg
,
in
her
gloomy
moment
,
have
foreboding
that
,
like
other
husband
of
whom
she
have
hear
,
he
may
cherish
the
mean
project
of
heighten
her
grief
at
his
death
by
leave
her
poorly
off
,
in
which
case
she
be
firmly
resolve
that
she
would
have
scarcely
any
weeper
on
her
bonnet
,
and
would
cry
no
more
than
if
he
have
be
a
second
husband
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
have
really
show
her
any
testamentary
tenderness
,
it
would
be
affect
to
think
of
him
,
poor
man
,
when
he
be
go
;
and
even
his
foolish
fuss
about
the
flower
and
garden
-
stuff
,
and
his
insistence
on
the
subject
of
snail
,
would
be
touching
when
it
be
once
fairly
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
to
survive
Mr.
Glegg
,
and
talk
eulogistically
of
him
as
a
man
who
may
have
his
weakness
,
but
who
have
do
the
right
thing
by
her
,
not
-
withstand
his
numerous
poor
relation
;
to
have
sum
of
interest
come
in
more
frequently
,
and
secrete
it
in
various
corner
,
baffle
to
the
most
ingenious
of
thief
(
for
,
to
Mrs.
Glegg
's
mind
,
bank
and
strong
-
box
would
have
nullify
the
pleasure
of
property
;
she
may
as
well
have
take
her
food
in
capsules
)
;
finally
,
to
be
look
up
to
by
her
own
family
and
the
neighborhood
,
so
as
no
woman
can
ever
hope
to
be
who
have
not
the
præterite
and
present
dignity
comprise
in
be
a
"
widow
well
leave
,
"
 
all
this
make
a
flattering
and
conciliatory
view
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
so
that
when
good
Mr.
Glegg
,
restore
to
good
humor
by
much
hoeing
,
and
move
by
the
sight
of
his
wife
's
empty
chair
,
with
her
knitting
roll
up
in
the
corner
,
go
up

stair
to
her
,
and
observe
that
the
bell
have
be
toll
for
poor
Mr.
Morton
,
Mrs.
Glegg
answer
magnanimously
,
quite
as
if
she
have
be
an
uninjured
woman
:
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
then
,
there
will
be
a
good
business
for

<EOS>
Baxter
have
be
open
at

eight
hour
by
this

for
it
be
nearly
five
o'clock
;
and
if
people
be
to
quarrel
often
,
it
follow
as
a
corollary
that
their
quarrel
can
not
be
protract
beyond
certain
limit

<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Glegg
talk
quite
amicably
about
the
Tullivers
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
go
the
length
of
admit
that
Tulliver
be
a
sad
man
for
get
into
hot
water
,
and
be
like
enough
to
run
through
his
property
;
and
Mrs.
Glegg
,
meet
this
acknowledgment
half
-
way
,
declare
that
it
be
beneath
her
to
take
notice
of
such
a
man
's
conduct
,
and
that
,
for
her
sister
's
sake
,
she
would
let
him
keep
the
five
hundred
a
while
longer
,
for
when
she
put
it
out
on
a
mortgage
<EOS>
she
should
only
get
four
per
cent
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
Further
entangle
the
Skein
of
Life
  
<EOS>
owe
to
this
new
adjustment
of
Mrs.
Glegg
's
thought
,
Mrs.
Pullet
find
her
task
of
mediation
the
next
day
surprisingly
easy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
,
indeed
check
her
rather
sharply
for
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
tell
her
eld
sister
<EOS>
what
be
the
right
mode
of
behavior
in
family
matter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
's
argument
,
that
it
would
look
ill
in
the
neighborhood
if
people
should
have
it
in
their
power
to
say
that
there
be
a
quarrel
in
the
family

be
particularly
offensive
.
<EOS>
if
the

name
never
suffer
except
through
Mrs.
Glegg

Mrs.
Pullet
may
lay
her
head
on
her
pillow
in
perfect
confidence

<EOS>
"
It
be
not

I
suppose

"
observe
Mrs.
Glegg
,
by
way
of
wind
up
the
subject
,
"
as
I
shall
go
to

again
before

"
  
<EOS>
find
it
unnecessary
to
plead
for
the
Tullivers
,
it
be
natural
that
aunt
Pullet
should
relax
a
little
in
her
anxiety
for
them
,
and
recur
to
the
annoyance
she
have
suffer
yesterday
from
the
offspring

Mrs.

aunt

blame

appeal
to

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
be
in
this
state
of
satisfaction
in
her
own
lofty
magnanimity
,
I
leave
you
to
judge
what
effect
be
produce
on
her
by
the
reception
of
a
short
letter
from
Mr.
Tulliver
that
very
evening
,
after
Mrs.
Pullet
's
departure
,
inform
her
that
she
nee
not
trouble
her
mind
about
her
five
hundred
pound
,
for
it
should
be
pay
back
to
her
in
the
course
of
the
next
month
at
farth
,
together
with
the
interest
due
thereon
until
the
time
of
payment
.
<EOS>
and
furthermore
,
that
Mr.
Tulliver
have
no
wish
to
behave
uncivilly
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
and
she
be
welcome
to
his
house
whenever
she
like
to
come
,
but
he
desire
no
favor
from
her
,
either
for
himself
or
his
child
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
who
have
hasten
this
catastrophe
,
entirely
through
that
irrepressible
hopefulness
of
her
which
lead
her
to
expect
that
similar
cause
may
at
any
time
produce
different
result
.
<EOS>
It
have
very
often
occur
in
her
experience
that
Mr.
Tulliver
have
do
something
because
other
people
have
say
he
be
not
able
to
do
it
,
or
have
pity
him
for
his
suppose
inability
,
or
in
any
other
way
pique
his
pride
;
still
,
she
think
to
-
day
,
if
she
tell
him
when
he
come
in
to
tea
that
sister
Pullet
be
go
to
try
and
make
everything
up
with
sister
Glegg
,
so
that
he
nee
not
think
about
pay
in
the
money
,
it
would
give
a
cheerful
effect
to
the
meal
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
have
never
slacken
in
his
resolve
to
raise
the
money
,
but
now
he
at
once
determine
to
write
a
letter
to
Mrs.
Glegg
,
which
should
cut
off
all
possibility
of
mistake
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
go
to
beg
and
pray
for
_
him
_
indeed
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
do
not
willingly
write
a
letter
,
and
find
the
relation
between
spoken
and
write
language
,
briefly
know
as
spelling
,
one
of
the
most
puzzling
thing
in
this
puzzling
world
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
like
all
fervid
writing
,
the
task
be
do
in
less
time
than
usual
,
and
if
the
spelling
differ
from
Mrs.
Glegg
's
,
 
why
,
she
belong
,
like
himself
,
to
a
generation
with
whom
spelling
be
a
matter
of
private
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
do
not
alter
her
will
in
consequence
of
this
letter
,
and
cut
off
the
Tulliver
child
from
their
sixth
and
seventh
share
in
her
thousand
pound
;
for
she
have
her
principle
.
<EOS>
no
one
must
be
able
to
say
of
her
when
she
be
dead
that
she
have
not
divide
her
money
with
perfect
fairness
among
her
own
kin
.
<EOS>
in
the
matter
of
will
,
personal
quality
be
subordinate
to
the
great
fundamental
fact
of
blood
;
and
to
be
determine
in
the
distribution
of
your
property
by
caprice
,
and
not
make
your
legacy
bear
a
direct
ratio
to
degree
of
kinship
,
be
a
prospective
disgrace
that
would
have
embitter
her
life
.
<EOS>
this
have
always
be
a
principle
in
the
Dodson
family
;
it
be
one
form
if
that
sense
of
honor
and
rectitude
which
be
a
proud
tradition
in
such
family
,
 
a
tradition
which
have
be
the
salt
of
our
provincial
society
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
the
letter
could
not
shake
Mrs.
Glegg
's
principle
,
it
make
the
family
breach
much
more
difficult
to
mend
;
and
as
to
the
effect
it
produce
on
Mrs.
Glegg
's
opinion
of
Mr.
Tulliver
,
she
beg
to
be
understand
from
that
time
forth
that
she
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
about
him
;
his
state
of
mind
,
apparently
,
be
too
corrupt
for
her
to
contemplate
it
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
the
evening
before
Tom
go
to
school
,
at
the
beginning
of
August
,
that
Mrs.
Glegg
pay
a
visit
to
her
sister
Tulliver
,
sit
in
her
gig
all
the
while
,
and
show
her
displeasure
by
markedly
abstain
from
all
advice
and
criticism
;
for
,
as
she
observe
to
her
sister
Deane
,
"
bessy
must
bear
the
consequence
o
'
have
such
a
husband
,
though
I
be
sorry
for
her
,
"
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Deane
agree
that
Bessy
be
pitiable
.
  
<EOS>
that
evening
Tom
observe
to
Maggie
:
"
<EOS>
oh
my

<EOS>
Maggie
,
aunt
Glegg

I
be
glad
I

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
will

catch
it
all
now

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
be
already
so
full
of
sorrow
at
the
thought
of
Tom
's
go
away
from
her
,
that
this
playful
exultation
of
his
seem
very
unkind
,
and
she
cry
herself
to
sleep
that
night

<EOS>
Mr.

prompt

entail
on
him
further
promptitude
in
find
the
convenient
person
who
be
desirous
of
lend
five
hundred
pound

bond

<EOS>
"
It
must
be
no
client

Wakem

he
say
to
himself
;
and
yet
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
it
turn
out
to
the
contrary
;
not
because
Mr.

will
be
feeble

but
because

fact
be
strong

<EOS>
Wakem

be
the
only

to
be
find
.
<EOS>
Mr.

have
a
destiny
as

as
Œdipus

and
in
this
case
he
may
plead

<EOS>
at

not

familiarly

him
to

like

surround
their

with
arabesque

to
spell
without

and
to
spout
"

without
bungle
,
Tom
,
for
his
part
,
be
glad
he
be
not
in
danger
of
those
mean
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
go
to
be
a
snuffy
schoolmaster
,
he
,
but
a
substantial
man
,
like
his
father
,
who
use
to
go
hunting
when
he
be
young
,
and
ride
a
capital
black

,
 
as
pretty

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He

mean
to

too

<EOS>
when
people
be
grow
up
,
he
consider
,
nobody
inquire
about
their
writing
and
spelling
;
when
he
be
a
man
,
he
should
be
master
of
everything
,
and
do
just
as
he
like
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
very
difficult
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
his
school

time
be
to
be
prolong
and
that
he
be
not
to
be
bring
up
to
his
father

business

which
he
have
always
think
extremely
pleasant
;
for
it
be
nothing
but
ride
about
,
give
order
,
and
go
to
market
;
and
he
think
that
a
clergyman
would
give
him
a
great
many
scripture
lesson
,
and
probably
make
him
learn
the
Gospel

Epistle
on
a
Sunday
,
as
well
as
the
Collect
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
absence
of
specific
information
,
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
that
school
and
a
schoolmaster
would
be
something
entirely
different
from
the
academy
of
Mr.
Jacobs
.
<EOS>
so
,
not
to

at
a

in

box
of
percussion
-
cap
;
not
that
there
be
anything
particular
to
be
do
with
them
,
but
they
would
serve
to
impress
strange
boy
with
a
sense
of
his
familiarity
with
gun
.
<EOS>
thus
poor
Tom
,
though
he
see
very
clearly
through
Maggie
's
illusion
,
be
not
without
illusion
of
his
own
,
which
be
to
be
cruelly
dissipate
by
his
enlarged
experience
at
King
's
Lorton
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
there
a
fortnight
before
it
be
evident
to
him
<EOS>
that
life
,
complicate
not
only
with
the
latin
grammar
but
with
a
new
standard
of
english
pronunciation
,
be
a
very
difficult
business
,
make
all
the
more
obscure
by
a
thick
mist
of
bashfulness
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
as
you
have
observe
,
be
never
an
exception
among
boy
for
ease
of
address
;
but
the
difficulty
of
enunciate
a
monosyllable
in
reply
to
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Stelling
be
so
great
,
that
he
even
dread
to
be
ask
at
table
whether
he
would
have
more
pudding
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
percussion
-
cap
,
he
have
almost
resolve
,
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
,
that
he
would
throw
them
into
a
neighboring
pond
;
for
not
only
be
he
the
solitary
pupil
,
but
he
begin
even
to
have
a
certain
scepticism
about
gun
,
and
a
general
sense
that
his
theory
of
life
be
undermine
.
<EOS>
for
Mr.
Stelling
think
nothing
of
gun
,
or
horse
either
,
apparently
;
and
yet
it
be
impossible
for
Tom
to
despise
Mr.
Stelling
as
he
have
despise
Old
Goggles
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
that
be
not
thoroughly
genuine
about
Mr.
Stelling
,
it
lie
quite
beyond
Tom
's
power
to
detect
it
;
it
be
only
by
a
wide
comparison
of
fact
that
the
wise
full
-
grown
man
can
distinguish
well
-
roll
barrel
from
mere
supernal
thunder
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
be
a
well
-
sized
,
broad
-
cheste
man
,
not
yet
thirty
,
with
flaxen
hair
standing
erect
,
and
large
lightish
-
gray
eye
,
which
be
always
very
wide
open
;
he
have
a
sonorous
bass
voice
,
and
an
air
of
defiant
self
-
confidence
incline
to
brazenness
.
<EOS>
He
have
enter
on
his
career
with
great
vigor
,
and
intend
to
make
a
considerable
impression
on
his
fellowman
.
<EOS>
the
Rev.
Walter
stelle
be
not
a
man
who
would
remain
among
the
"
inferior
clergy
"
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
true
british
determination
to
push
his
way
in
the
world
,
 
as
a
schoolmaster
,
in
the
first
place
,
for
there
be
capital
mastership
of
grammar
-
school
to
be
have
,
and
Mr.
Stelling
mean
to
have
one
of
them
;
but
as
a
preacher
also
,
for
he
mean
always
to
preach
in
a
striking
manner
,
so
as
to
have
his
congregation
swell
by
admirer
from
neighbor
parish
,
and
to
produce
a
great
sensation
whenever
he
take
occasional
duty
for
a
brother
clergyman
of
minor
gift
.
<EOS>
the
style
of
preach
he
have
choose
be
the
extemporaneous
,
which
be
hold
little
short
of
the
miraculous
in
rural
parish
like
King
's
Lorton
.
<EOS>
some
passage
of
Massillon
and
Bourdaloue
,
which
he
know
by
heart
,
be
really
very
effective
when
roll
out
in
Mr.
Stelling
's
deep
tone
;
but
as
comparatively
feeble
appeal
of
his
own
be
deliver
in
the
same
loud
and
impressive
manner
,
they
be
often
think
quite
as
strike
by
his
hearer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
's
doctrine
be
of
no
particular
school
;
if
anything
,
it
have
a
tinge
of
evangelicalism
,
<EOS>
for
that
be
"
the
tell
thing
"
just
then
in
the
diocese
to
which
King
's
Lorton
belong
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
Mr.
Stelling
be
a
man
who
mean
to
rise
in
his
profession
,
and
to
rise
by
merit
,
clearly
,
since
he
have
no
interest
beyond
what
may
be
promise
by
a
problematic
relationship
to
a
great
lawyer
who
have
not
yet
become
Lord
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
a
clergyman
who
have
such
vigorous
intention
naturally
get
a
little
into
debt
at
start
;
it
be
not
to
be
expect
that
he
will
live
in
the
meagre
style
of
a
man
who
mean
to
be
a
poor
curate
all
his
life
;
and
if
the
few
hundred
Mr.
Timpson
advance
toward
his
daughter
's
fortune
do
not
suffice
for
the
purchase
of
handsome
furniture
,
together
with
a
stock
of
wine
,
a
grand
piano
,
and
the
laying
out
of
a
superior
flower
-
garden
,
it
follow
in
the
most
rigorous
manner
,
either
that
these
thing
must
be
procure
by
some
other
mean
,
or
else
that
the
Rev.
Mr.
Stelling
must
go
without
them
,
which
last
alternative
would
be
an
absurd
procrastination
of
the
fruit
of
success
,
where
success
be
certain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
be
so
broad
-
cheste
and
resolute
that
he
feel
equal
to
anything
;
he
would
become
celebrate
by
shake
the
conscience
of
his
hearer
,
and
he
would
by
and
by
edit
a
Greek
play
,
and
invent
several
new
reading
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
yet
select
the
play
,
for
have
be
marry
little
more
than
two
year
,
his
leisure
time
have
be
much
occupy
with
attention
to
Mrs.
stelle
;
but
he
have
tell
that
fine
woman
what
he
mean
to
do
some
day
,
and
she
feel
great
confidence
in
her
husband
,
as
a
man
who
understand
everything
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
immediate
step
to
future
success
be
to
bring
on
Tom
Tulliver
during
this
first
half
-
year
;
for
,
by
a
singular
coincidence
,
there
have
be
some
negotiation
concern
another
pupil
from
the
same
neighborhood
and
it
may
further
a
decision
in
Mr.
Stelling
's
favor
,
if
it
be
understand
that
young
Tulliver
,
who
,
Mr.
Stelling
observe
in
conjugal
privacy
,
be
rather
a
rough
cub
,
have
make
prodigious
progress
in
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
ground
that
he
be
severe
with
Tom
about
his
lesson
;
he
be
clearly
a
boy
whose
power
would
never
be
develop
through
the
medium
of
the
latin
grammar
,
without
the
application
of
some
sternness
.
<EOS>
not
that
Mr.
Stelling
be
a
harsh
-
tempered
or
unkind
man
;
quite
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
He
be
jocose
with
Tom
at
table
,
and
correct
his
provincialism
and
his
deportment
in
the
most
playful
manner
;
but
poor
Tom
be
only
the
more
cowed
and
confuse
by
this
double
novelty
,
for
he
have
never
be
use
to
joke
at
all
like
Mr.
Stelling
's
;
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
have
a
painful
sense
that
he
be
all
wrong
somehow
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Stelling
say
,
as
the
roast
-
beef
be
be
uncover
,
"
now
,
Tulliver
!
<EOS>
which
would
you
rather
decline
,
roast
-
beef
or
the
Latin
for
it
?
"
<EOS>
Tom
,
to
whom
in
his
cool
moment
a
pun
would
have
be
a
hard
nut
,
be
throw
into
a
state
of
embarrassed
alarm
that
make
everything
dim
to
him
except
the
feeling
that
he
would
rather
not
have
anything
to
do
with
Latin
;
of
course
he
answer
,
"
roast
-
beef
,
"
whereupon
there
follow
much
laughter
and
some
practical
joking
with
the
plate
,
from
which
Tom
gather
that
he
have
in
some
mysterious
way
refuse
beef
,
and
,
in
fact
,
make
himself
appear
"
a
silly
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
could
have
see
a
fellow
-
pupil
undergo
these
painful
operation
and
survive
them
in
good
spirit
,
he
may
sooner
have
take
them
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
two
expensive
form
of
education
,
either
of
which
a
parent
may
procure
for
his
son
by
send
him
as
solitary
pupil
to
a
clergyman
:
<EOS>
one
be
the
enjoyment
of
the
reverend
gentleman
's
undivided
neglect
;
the
other
be
the
endurance
of
the
reverend
gentleman
's
undivided
attention
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
latter
privilege
for
which
Mr.
Tulliver
pay
a
high
price
in
Tom
's
initiatory
month
at
King
's
Lorton
.
  
<EOS>
that
respectable
miller
and
maltster
have
leave
Tom
behind
,
and
drive
homeward
in
a
state
of
great
mental
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
consider
that
it
be
a
happy
moment
for
him
when
he
have
think
of
ask
Riley
's
advice
about
a
tutor
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
's
eye
be
so
wide
open
,
and
he
talk
in
such
an
off
-
hand
,
matter
-
of
-
fact
way
,
answer
every
difficult
,
slow
remark
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
with
,
"
<EOS>
I
see
,
my
good
sir
,
I
see
"
;
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
"
;
"
You
want
your
son
to
be
a
man
who
will
make
his
way
in
the
world
,
"
 
that
Mr.
Tulliver
be
delighted
to
find
in
him
a
clergyman
whose
knowledge
be
so
applicable
to
the
every
-
day
affair
of
this
life
.
<EOS>
except
Counsellor
Wylde
,
whom
he
have
hear
at
the
last
session
,
Mr.
Tulliver
think
the
Rev.
Mr
stelle
be
the
shrewd
fellow
he
have
ever
meet
with
,
 
not
unlike
Wylde
,
in
fact
;
he
have
the
same
way
of
stick
his
thumb
in
the
armhole
of
his
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
be
not
by
any
mean
an
exception
in
mistake
brazenness
for
shrewdness
;
most
layman
think
stelle
shrewd
,
and
a
man
of
remarkable
power
generally
;
it
be
chiefly
by
his
clerical
brother
that
he
be
consider
rather
a
full
fellow
.
<EOS>
but
he
tell
Mr.
Tulliver
several
story
about
"
swing
"
and
incendiarism
,
and
ask
his
advice
about
feed
pig
in
so
thoroughly
secular
and
judicious
a
manner
,
with
so
much
polished
glibness
of
tongue
,
that
the
miller
think
,
here
be
the
very
thing
he
want
for
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
doubt
this
first
-
rate
man
be
acquaint
with
every
branch
of
information
,
and
know
exactly
what
Tom
must
learn
in
order
to
become
a
match
for
the
lawyer
,
which
poor
Mr.
Tulliver
himself
do
_
<EOS>
not
_
know
,
and
so
be
necessarily
throw
for
self
-
direction
on
this
wide
kind
of
inference
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
fair
to
laugh
at
him
,
for
I
have
know
much
more
highly
instructed
person
than
he
make
inference
quite
as
wide
,
and
not
at
all
wise
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
find
that
Mrs.
Stelling
's
view
as
to
the
airing
of
linen
and
the
frequent
recurrence
of
hunger
in
a
grow
boy
entirely
coincide
with
her
own
;
moreover
,
that
Mrs.
Stelling
,
though
so
young
a
woman
,
and
only
anticipate
her
second
confinement
,
have
go
through
very
nearly
the
same
experience
as
herself
with
regard
to
the
behavior
and
fundamental
character
of
the
monthly
nurse
,
 
she
express
great
contentment
to
her
husband
,
when
they
drive
away
,
at
leave
Tom
with
a
woman
who
,
in
spite
of
her
youth
,
seem
quite
sensible
and
motherly
,
and
ask
advice
as
prettily
as
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
be
very
well
off
,
though
,
"
say
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
"
for
everything
be
as
nice
as
can
be
all
over
the
house
,
and
that
water
silk
<EOS>
she
have
on
cost
a
pretty
penny
.
<EOS>
Sister
Pullet
have
get
one
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
say
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
he
be
get
some
income
besides
the
curacy
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
perhaps
her
father
allow
'em
something
.
<EOS>
there
be
Tom
"
ull
<EOS>
be
another
hundred
to
him
,
and
not
much
trouble
either
,
by
his
own
account
;
he
say
teaching
come
natural
to
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
wonderful
,
now
,
"
add
Mr.
Tulliver
,
turn
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
give
his
horse
a
meditative
tickling
on
the
flank
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
because
teaching
come
naturally
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
that
he
set
about
it
with
that
uniformity
of
method
and
independence
of
circumstance
which
distinguish
the
action
of
animal
understand
to
be
under
the
immediate
teaching
of
nature
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Broderip
's
amiable
beaver
,
as
that
charming
naturalist
tell
us
,
busy
himself
as
earnestly
in
construct
a
dam
,
in
a
room
up
three
pair
of
stair
in
London
,
as
if
he
have
be
lay
his
foundation
in
a
stream
or
lake
in
Upper
Canada
.
<EOS>
It
be
"
Binny
's
"
function
to
build
;
the
absence
of
water
or
of
possible
progeny
be
an
accident
for
which
he
be
not
accountable
.
<EOS>
with
the
same
unerring
instinct
Mr.
Stelling
set
to
work
at
his
natural
method
of
instill
the
Eton
Grammar
and
Euclid
into
the
mind
of
Tom
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
this
,
he
consider
,
be
the
only
basis
of
solid
instruction
;
all
other
mean
of
education
be
mere
charlatanism
,
and
could
produce
nothing
well
than
smatterer
.
<EOS>
fix
on
this
firm
basis
,
a
man
may
observe
the
display
of
various
or
special
knowledge
make
by
irregularly
educate
people
with
a
pity
smile
;
all
that
sort
of
thing
be
very
well
,
but
it
be
impossible
these
people
could
form
sound
opinion
.
<EOS>
in
hold
this
conviction
Mr.
Stelling
be
not
bias
,
as
some
tutor
have
be
,
by
the
excessive
accuracy
or
extent
of
his
own
scholarship
;
and
as
to
his
view
about
Euclid
,
no
opinion
could
have
be
free
from
personal
partiality
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
be
very
far
from
be
lead
astray
by
enthusiasm
,
either
religious
or
intellectual
;
on
the
other
hand
,
he
have
no
secret
belief
that
everything
be
humbug
.
<EOS>
He
think
religion
be
a
very
excellent
thing
,
and
Aristotle
a
great
authority
,
and
deanery
and
prebend
useful
institution
,
and
Great
Britain
the
providential
bulwark
of
Protestantism
,
and
faith
in
the
unseen
a
great
support
to
afflict
mind
;
he
believe
in
all
these
thing
,
as
a
swiss
hotel
-
keeper
believe
in
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
around
him
,
and
in
the
pleasure
it
give
to
artistic
visitor
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
same
way
Mr.
Stelling
believe
in
his
method
of
education
;
he
have
no
doubt
that
he
be
do
the
very
good
thing
for
Mr.
Tulliver
's
boy
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
when
the
miller
talk
of
"
mapping
"
and
"
sum
"
in
a
vague
and
diffident
manner
,
Mr
Stelling
have
set
his
mind
at
rest
by
an
assurance
that
he
understand
what
be
want
;
for
how
be
it
possible
the
good
man
could
form
any
reasonable
judgment
about
the
matter
?
<EOS>
Mr
Stelling
's
duty
be
to
teach
the
lad
in
the
only
right
way
,
 
indeed
he
know
no
other
;
he
have
not
waste
his
time
in
the
acquirement
of
anything
abnormal
.
  
<EOS>
He
very
soon
set
down
poor
Tom
as
a
thoroughly
stupid
lad
;
for
though
by
hard
labor
he
could
get
particular
declension
into
his
brain
,
anything
so
abstract
as
the
relation
between
case
and
termination
could
by
no
mean
get
such
a
lodgment
there
as
to
enable
him
to
recognize
a
chance
genitive
or
dative
.
<EOS>
this
strike
Mr.
Stelling
as
something
more
than
natural
stupidity
;
he
suspect
obstinacy
,
or
at
any
rate
indifference
,
and
lecture
Tom
severely
on
his
want
of
thorough
application
.
<EOS>
"
You
feel
no
interest
in
what
you
be
do
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Stelling
would
say
,
and
the
reproach
be
painfully
true
.
<EOS>
Tom
have
never
find
any
difficulty
in
discern
a
pointer
from
a
setter
,
when
once
he
have
be
tell
the
distinction
,
and
his
perceptive
power
be
not
at
all
deficient
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
they
be
quite
as
strong
as
those
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Stelling
;
for
Tom
could
predict
with
accuracy
what
number
of
horse
be
canter
behind
him
,
he
could
throw
a
stone
right
into
the
centre
of
a
give
ripple
,
he
could
guess
to
a
fraction
how
many
length
of
his
stick
it
would
take
to
reach
across
the
playground
,
and
could
draw
almost
perfect
square
on
his
slate
without
any
measurement
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Stelling
take
no
note
of
these
thing
;
he
only
observe
that
Tom
's
faculty
fail
him
before
the
abstraction
hideously
symbolize
to
him
in
the
page
of
the
Eton
Grammar
,
and
that
he
be
in
a
state
border
on
idiocy
with
regard
to
the
demonstration
that
two
give
triangle
must
be
equal
,
though
he
could
discern
with
great
promptitude
and
certainty
the
fact
that
they
_
be
_
equal
.
<EOS>
Whence
Mr.
Stelling
conclude
that
Tom
's
brain
,
be
peculiarly
impervious
to
etymology
and
demonstration
,
be
peculiarly
in
need
of
be
plough
and
harrow
by
these
patent
implement
;
it
be
his
favorite
metaphor
,
that
the
classic
and
geometry
constitute
that
culture
of
the
mind
which
prepare
it
for
the
reception
of
any
subsequent
crop
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
against
Mr.
Stelling
's
theory
;
if
we
be
to
have
one
regiman
for
all
mind
,
his
seem
to
me
as
good
as
any
other
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
it
turn
out
as
uncomfortably
for
Tom
Tulliver
as
if
he
have
be
ply
with
cheese
in
order
to
remedy
a
gastric
weakness
which
prevent
him
from
digest
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
what
a
different
result
one
get
by
change
the
metaphor
!
<EOS>
once
call
the
brain
an
intellectual
stomach
,
and
one
's
ingenious
conception
of
the
classic
and
geometry
as
plough
and
harrow
seem
to
settle
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
be
open
to
some
one
else
to
follow
great
authority
,
and
call
the
mind
a
sheet
of
white
paper
or
a
mirror
,
in
which
case
one
's
knowledge
of
the
digestive
process
become
quite
irrelevant
.
<EOS>
It
be
doubtless
an
ingenious
idea
to
call
the
camel
the
ship
of
the
desert
,
but
it
would
hardly
lead
one
far
in
training
that
useful
beast
.
<EOS>
o
Aristotle
!
<EOS>
if
you
have
have
the
advantage
of
be
"
the
fresh
modern
"
instead
of
the
great
ancient
,
would
you
not
have
mingle
your
praise
of
metaphorical
speech
,
as
a
sign
of
high
intelligence
,
with
a
lamentation
that
intelligence
so
rarely
show
itself
in
speech
without
metaphor
,
 
that
we
can
so
seldom
declare
what
a
thing
be
,
except
by
say
it
be
something
else
?
  
<EOS>
Tom
Tulliver
,
be
abundant
in
no
form
of
speech
,
do
not
use
any
metaphor
to
declare
his
view
as
to
the
nature
of
Latin
;
he
never
call
it
an
instrument
of
torture
;
and
it
be
not
until
he
have
get
on
some
way
in
the
next
half
-
year
,
and
in
the
Delectus
,
that
he
be
advanced
enough
to
call
it
a
"
bore
"
and
"
beastly
stuff
.
<EOS>
"
at
present
,
in
relation
to
this
demand
that
he
should
learn
latin
declension
and
conjugation
,
Tom
be
in
a
state
of
as
blank
unimaginativeness
concern
the
cause
and
tendency
of
his
suffering
,
as
if
he
have
be
an
innocent
shrewmouse
imprison
in
the
split
trunk
of
an
ash
-
tree
in
order
to
cure
lameness
in
cattle
.
<EOS>
It
be
doubtless
almost
incredible
to
instruct
mind
of
the
present
day
that
a
boy
of
twelve
,
not
belong
strictly
to
"
the
masse
,
"
who
be
now
understand
to
have
the
monopoly
of
mental
darkness
,
should
have
have
no
distinct
idea
how
there
come
to
be
such
a
thing
as
Latin
on
this
earth
;
yet
so
it
be
with
Tom
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
take
a
long
while
to
make
conceivable
to
him
that
there
ever
exist
a
people
who
buy
and
sell
sheep
and
oxen
,
and
transact
the
every
-
day
affair
of
life
,
through
the
medium
of
this
language
;
and
still
longer
to
make
him
understand
why
he
should
be
call
upon
to
learn
it
,
when
its
connection
with
those
affair
have
become
entirely
latent
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
Tom
have
gain
any
acquaintance
with
the
Romans
at
Mr.
Jacob
's
academy
,
his
knowledge
be
strictly
correct
,
but
it
go
no
farther
than
the
fact
that
they
be
"
in
the
New
Testament
"
;
and
Mr.
Stelling
be
not
the
man
to
enfeeble
and
emasculate
his
pupil
's
mind
by
simplify
and
explain
,
or
to
reduce
the
tonic
effect
of
etymology
by
mix
it
with
smatter
,
extraneous
information
,
such
as
be
give
to
girl
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
under
this
vigorous
treatment
Tom
become
more
like
a
girl
than
he
have
ever
be
in
his
life
before
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
large
share
of
pride
,
which
have
hitherto
find
itself
very
comfortable
in
the
world
,
despise
Old
Goggles
,
and
repose
in
the
sense
of
unquestioned
right
;
but
now
this
same
pride
meet
with
nothing
but
bruise
and
crushing
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
too
clear
-
sighted
not
to
be
aware
that
Mr.
Stelling
's
standard
of
thing
be
quite
different
,
be
certainly
something
high
in
the
eye
of
the
world
than
that
of
the
people
he
have
be
live
amongst
,
and
that
,
bring
in
contact
with
it
,
he
,
Tom
Tulliver
,
appear
uncouth
and
stupid
;
he
be
by
no
means
indifferent
to
this
,
and
his
pride
get
into
an
uneasy
condition
which
quite
nullify
his
boyish
self
-
satisfaction
,
and
give
him
something
of
the
girl
's
susceptibility
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
firm
,
not
to
say
obstinate
,
disposition
,
but
there
be
no
brute
-
like
rebellion
and
recklessness
in
his
nature
;
the
human
sensibility
predominate
,
and
if
it
have
occur
to
him
that
he
could
enable
himself
to
show
some
quickness
at
his
lesson
,
and
so
acquire
Mr.
Stelling
's
approbation
,
by
stand
on
one
leg
for
an
inconvenient
length
of
time
,
or
rap
his
head
moderately
against
the
wall
,
or
any
voluntary
action
of
that
sort
,
he
would
certainly
have
try
it
.
<EOS>
but
no
;
Tom
have
never
hear
that
these
measure
would
brighten
the
understanding
,
or
strengthen
the
verbal
memory
;
and
he
be
not
give
to
hypothesis
and
experiment
.
<EOS>
It
do
occur
to
him
that
he
could
perhaps
get
some
help
by
pray
for
it
;
but
as
the
prayer
he
say
every
evening
be
form
learn
by
heart
,
he
rather
shrink
from
the
novelty
and
irregularity
of
introduce
an
extempore
passage
on
a
topic
of
petition
for
which
he
be
not
aware
of
any
precedent
.
<EOS>
but
one
day
,
when
he
have
break
down
,
for
the
fifth
time
,
in
the
supine
of
the
third
conjugation
,
and
Mr.
Stelling
,
convince
that
this
must
be
carelessness
,
since
it
transcend
the
bound
of
possible
stupidity
,
have
lecture
him
very
seriously
,
point
out
that
if
he
fail
to
seize
the
present
golden
opportunity
of
learn
supine
,
he
would
have
to
regret
it
when
he
become
a
man
,
 
Tom
,
more
miserable
than
usual
,
determined
to
try
his
sole
resource
;
and
that
evening
,
after
his
usual
form
of
prayer
for
his
parent
and
"
little
sister
"
(
he
have
begin
to
pray
for
Maggie
when
she
be
a
baby
)
,
and
that
he
may
be
able
always
to
keep
God
's
commandment
,
he
add
,
in
the
same
low
whisper
,
"
and
please
to
make
me
always
remember
my
Latin
.
"
<EOS>
He
pause
a
little
to
consider
how
he
should
pray
about
Euclid
 
whether
he
should
ask
to
see
what
it
mean
,
or
whether
there
be
any
other
mental
state
which
would
be
more
applicable
to
the
case
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
he
add
:
"
<EOS>
and
make
Mr.
Stelling
say
I
sha'n"t
do
Euclid
any
more
.
<EOS>
amen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
fact
that
he
get
through
his
supine
without
mistake
the
next
day
,
encourage
him
to
persevere
in
this
appendix
to
his
prayer
,
and
neutralize
any
scepticism
that
may
have
arise
from
Mr.
Stelling
's
continue
demand
for
Euclid
.
<EOS>
but
his
faith
break
down
under
the
apparent
absence
of
all
help
when
he
get
into
the
irregular
verb
.
<EOS>
It
seem
clear
that
Tom
's
despair
under
the
caprice
of
the
present
tense
do
not
constitute
a
_
nodus
<EOS>
_
worthy
of
interference
,
and
since
this
be
the
climax
of
his
difficulty
,
where
be
the
use
of
pray
for
help
any
longer
?
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mind
to
this
conclusion
in
one
of
his
dull
,
lonely
evening
,
which
he
spend
in
the
study
,
prepare
his
lesson
for
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
apt
to
get
dim
over
the
page
,
though
he
hate
cry
,
and
be
ashamed
of
it
;
he
could
not
help
think
with
some
affection
even
of
Spouncer
,
whom
he
use
to
fight
and
quarrel
with
;
he
would
have
feel
at
home
with
Spouncer
,
and
in
a
condition
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
mill
,
and
the
river
,
and
Yap
prick
up
his
ear
,
ready
to
obey
the
least
sign
when
Tom
say
,
"
Hoigh
!
"
would
all
come
before
him
in
a
sort
of
calenture
,
when
his
finger
play
absently
in
his
pocket
with
his
great
knife
and
his
coil
of
whipcord
,
and
other
relic
of
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
as
I
say
,
have
never
be
so
much
like
a
girl
in
his
life
before
,
and
at
that
epoch
of
irregular
verb
his
spirit
be
further
depress
by
a
new
mean
of
mental
development
which
have
be
think
of
for
him
out
of
school
hour
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stelling
have
lately
have
her
second
baby
,
and
as
nothing
could
be
more
salutary
for
a
boy
than
to
feel
himself
useful
,
Mrs.
Stelling
consider
she
be
do
Tom
a
service
by
set
him
to
watch
the
little
cherub
Laura
while
the
nurse
be
occupy
with
the
sickly
baby
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
pretty
employment
for
Tom
to
take
little
Laura
out
in
the
sunny
hour
of
the
autumn
day
;
it
would
help
to
make
him
feel
that
Lorton
Parsonage
be
a
home
for
him
,
and
that
he
be
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
the
little
cherub
Laura
,
not
be
an
accomplish
walker
at
present
,
have
a
ribbon
fasten
round
her
waist
,
by
which
Tom
hold
her
as
if
she
have
be
a
little
dog
during
the
minute
in
which
she
choose
to
walk
;
but
as
these
be
rare
,
he
be
for
the
most
part
carry
this
fine
child
round
and
round
the
garden
,
within
sight
of
Mrs.
Stelling
's
window
,
accord
to
order
.
<EOS>
if
any
one
consider
this
unfair
and
even
oppressive
toward
Tom
,
I
beg
him
to
consider
that
there
be
feminine
virtue
which
be
with
difficulty
combine
,
even
if
they
be
not
incompatible
.
<EOS>
when
the
wife
of
a
poor
curate
contrive
,
under
all
her
disadvantage
,
to
dress
extremely
well
,
and
to
have
a
style
of
coiffure
which
require
that
her
nurse
shall
occasionally
officiate
as
lady's
-
maid
;
when
,
moreover
,
her
dinner
-
party
and
her
drawing
-
room
show
that
effort
at
elegance
and
completeness
of
appointment
to
which
ordinary
woman
may
imagine
a
large
income
necessary
,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
of
her
that
she
should
employ
a
second
nurse
,
or
even
act
as
a
nurse
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
know
better
;
he
see
that
his
wife
do
wonder
already
,
and
be
proud
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
not
the
good
thing
in
the
world
for
young
Tulliver
's
gait
to
carry
a
heavy
child
,
but
he
have
plenty
of
exercise
in
long
walk
with
himself
,
and
next
half
-
year
Mr.
Stelling
would
see
about
have
a
drilling
-
master
.
<EOS>
among
the
many
mean
whereby
Mr.
Stelling
intend
to
be
more
fortunate
than
the
bulk
of
his
fellow
-
man
,
he
have
entirely
give
up
that
of
have
his
own
way
in
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
He
have
marry
"
as
kind
a
little
soul
as
ever
breathe
,
"
accord
to
Mr.
Riley
,
who
have
be
acquaint
with
Mrs.
Stelling
's
blond
ringlet
and
smile
demeanor
throughout
her
maiden
life
,
and
on
the
strength
of
that
knowledge
would
have
be
ready
any
day
to
pronounce
that
whatever
domestic
difference
may
arise
in
her
married
life
must
be
entirely
Mr.
Stelling
's
fault
.
  
<EOS>
if
Tom
have
have
a
bad
disposition
,
he
would
certainly
have
hate
the
little
cherub
Laura
,
but
he
be
too
kind
-
hearte
a
lad
for
that
;
there
be
too
much
in
him
of
the
fibre
that
turn
to
true
manliness
,
and
to
protect
pity
for
the
weak
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
he
hate
Mrs.
Stelling
,
and
contract
a
lasting
dislike
to
pale
blond
ringlet
and
broad
plait
,
as
directly
associate
with
haughtiness
of
manner
,
and
a
frequent
reference
to
other
people
's
"
duty
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
help
play
with
little
Laura
,
and
like
to
amuse
her
;
he
even
sacrifice
his
percussion
-
cap
for
her
sake
,
in
despair
of
their
ever
serve
a
great
purpose
,
 
think
the
small
flash
and
bang
would
delight
her
,
and
thereby
draw
down
on
himself
a
rebuke
from
Mrs.
stelle
for
teach
her
child
to
play
with
fire
.
<EOS>
Laura
be
a
sort
of
playfellow
 
<EOS>
and
oh
,
how
Tom
long
for
playfellow
!
<EOS>
in
his
secret
heart
he
yearn
to
have
Maggie
with
him
,
and
be
almost
ready
to
dote
on
her
exasperating
act
of
forgetfulness
;
though
,
when
he
be
at
home
,
he
always
represent
it
as
a
great
favor
on
his
part
to
let
Maggie
trot
by
his
side
on
his
pleasure
excursion
.
  
<EOS>
and
before
this
dreary
half
-
year
be
end
,
Maggie
actually
come
.

knowingness
,
though
beyond
measure
cheerful
at
the
thought
that
she
be
go
to
stay

<EOS>
Her
conceit
would
soon

Mrs.

in

between
his
knee
,
and
ask
her
where
she
steal
her
dark
eye
from

insist
that
she
must
stay
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Maggie
think
Mr.
Stelling
be
a
charming
man
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
be
quite
proud
to
leave
his
little
wench
where
she
would
have
an
opportunity
of
show
her
cleverness
to
appreciate

so
it
be
agree

Mr.

<EOS>
"

turn
to
throw

round

Tom

<EOS>
away
they

till
Maggie

hair
fly
from

till

they
send
it
thunder
down

happily

so
that

<EOS>
Maggie
find
the
Latin
Grammar
quite
soothing
after
her
mathematical
mortification

for
she
delight
in
new
word

and
quickly
find
that
there
be
an
English
Key
at

which
would
make

very
wise
about
Latin

at
slight
expense

She

so
absorb

these
mysterious

snatch
from

bring
from
some
far

off

give
boundless
scope
to
her
imagination

and
be
all
the
more
fascinating
because
they
be
in

peculiar
tongue

which
she
could
learn

<EOS>
It
be
really

Maggie

rather
piqued

turn
to

presently

cleverness

that

subdue
by

allude

a
little

hear

"
what

a
playfulness
that

She
fear
that
Mr.

after
all
,
do
not
think
much
of
her

go
to

in
rather
low
spirit

Mrs.

she

look
at

nevertheless
it
be

happy
fortnight

this
visit
to
Tom

<EOS>
She
be
allow
to
be
in
the
study
while

have
his
lesson

in
her
various
reading
get
very
deep
into
the
example
in

Latin
Grammar

<EOS>
the
astronomer
who
hate

generally
cause
her
so
much

speculation

she
one
day
ask
Mr.

if
all
astronomer
hate
woman
,
or
whether
it
be
only
this
particular
astronomer
.
<EOS>
but
forestall
his
answer
,
she
say
,
    
"
I
suppose
it
be
all
astronomer
;
because
,
you
know
,
they
live
up
in
high
tower
,
and
if
the
woman
come
there
they
may
talk
and
hinder
them
from
look

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

like
her
prattle
immensely
,
and
they
be
on
the
good
term
.
<EOS>
She
tell
Tom
she
should
like
to
go
to
school
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
as
he
do
,
and
learn
just
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
She
know
she
could
do
Euclid

for
she
have
look
into

again

she
see
what

they

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you

now

I
will
just
ask
Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

myself

Mr.

"
she

,
that

evening

"
could
not
I
do
Euclid

<EOS>
all
Tom

you
be
to
teach
me
instead
of
him

<EOS>
"
no

you
could
not

indignantly

"
girl
can
not
do
Euclid

can
they
,
sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
They
can
pick
up
a
little
of
everything
,
I
dare
say
,
"
say
Mr.
Stelling
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
a
great
deal
of
superficial
cleverness

but
they
could
not
go
far
into
anything

<EOS>
They
be
quick

shallow

"
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
delighted
with
this
verdict
,
telegraph
his
triumph
by
wag
his
head
at
Maggie
,
behind
Mr.
Stelling
's
chair
.
<EOS>
as
for
Maggie
,
she
have
hardly
ever
be
so
mortify
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
so
proud
to
be
call
"
quick
"
all
her
little
life
,
and
now
it
appear
that
this
quickness
be
the
brand
of
inferiority
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
to
be
slow
,
like
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Miss
Maggie
!
<EOS>
"
say
Tom
,
when
they
be
alone
;
"
you
see
it
be
not
such
a
fine
thing
to
be
quick
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
go
far
into
anything
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
Maggie
be
so
oppress
by
this
dreadful
destiny
that
she
have
no
spirit
for
a
retort
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
this
small
apparatus
of
shallow
quickness
be
fetch
away
in
the
gig
by
Luke
,
and
the
study
be
once
more
quite
lonely
for
Tom
,
he
miss
her
grievously
.
<EOS>
He
have
really
be
bright
,
and
have
get
through
his
lesson
better
,
since
she
have
be
there
;
and
she
have
ask
Mr.
Stelling
so
many
question
about
the
Roman
Empire
,
and
whether
there
really
ever
be
a
man
who
say
,
in
Latin
,
"
I
would
not
buy
it
for
a
farthing
or
a
rotten
nut
,
"
or
whether
that
have
only
be
turn
into
Latin
,
that
Tom
have
actually
come
to
a
dim
understanding
of
the
fact
that
there
have
once
be
people
upon
the
earth
who
be
so
fortunate
as
to
know
Latin
without
learn
it
through
the
medium
of
the
Eton
Grammar
.
<EOS>
this
luminous
idea
be
a
great
addition
to
his
historical
acquirement
during
this
half
-
year
,
which
be
otherwise
confine
to
an
epitomized
history
of
the
Jews
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
dreary
half

year
_
do
_
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
how
glad
Tom
be
to
see
the
last
yellow
leave
flutter
before
the
cold
wind
!
<EOS>
the
dark
afternoon
and
the
first
December
snow
seem
to
him
far
lively
than
the
August
sunshine
;
and
that
he
may
make
himself
the
sure
about
the
flight
of
the
day
that
be
carry
him
homeward
,
he
stick
twenty
-
one
stick
deep
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
,
when
he
be
three
week
from
the
holiday
,
and
pull
one
up
every
day
with
a
great
wrench
,
throw
it
to
a
distance
with
a
vigor
of
will
which
would
have
carry
it
to
limbo
,
if
it
have
be
in
the
nature
of
stick
to
travel
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
worth
purchase
,
even
at
the
heavy
price
of
the
Latin
Grammar

the
happiness
of
see
the
bright
light
in
the
parlor
at
home

as
the
gig
pass
noiselessly
over
the
snow

<EOS>
the
happiness
of
pass
from
the
cold
air
to
the
warmth
and
the
kiss

the
smile
of
that
familiar
hearth
,
where
the
pattern
of
the
rug

the
grate
and
the
fire

iron
be

first

it

no
more

the
solidity

<EOS>
there

before
we
have

the
labor

choice

where
the
outer

an
extension

it
as
we
accept
our

existence

our

<EOS>
very
commonplace
,
even
ugly

that
furniture
of
our
early
home
may
look
if
it
be
put
up
to
auction

an

scorn

that

the
attention

the

Mr.

be

he
consider
that
in

the
end

could
only
be
achieve
by
employ

strong

,
you
see

he
be
not
up

what

<EOS>
Mrs.

hurry
away
with

express
to
Mrs.

who
accompany

the
conviction

good

<EOS>
be
always
on

it
be
natural

keenly
conscious

superiority

even
as
the

Dodson

over
a

,
besides
be

I
think
sometimes
I
shall

drive
off

with
the
talk
about

my

lie
all

they
do
not

how
should
they

<EOS>
Sister

"
  
<EOS>

Mrs.

,
as
we
have

be
not

influence

no

she
can
always
incline
him

do
either
what

the
reverse

the
composite
impulse
that

Mrs.
Tulliver
's
monotonous
pleading
have
doubtless
its
share
of
force

it
may
even
be
comparable
to
that
proverbial
feather
which
have
the
credit
or
discredit
of
break
the
camel

back

though
,
on
a
strictly
impartial
view
,
the
blame
ought
rather
to
lie
with
the
previous
weight
of
feather
which
have
already
place
the
back
in
such
imminent
peril
that
an
otherwise
innocent
feather
could
not

<EOS>
not
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
feeble
beseeching
could
have
have
this
feather
's
weight
in
virtue
of
her
single
personality
;
but
whenever
she
depart
from
entire
assent
to
her
husband
,
he
see
in
her
the
representative
of
the
Dodson
family
;
and
it
be
a
guide
principle
with
Mr.
Tulliver
to
let
the
Dodsons
know
that
they
be
not
to
domineer
over
_
him
_
,
or
 
more
specifically
 
that
a
male
Tulliver
be
far
more
than
equal
to
four
female
dodson
,
even
though
one
of
them
be
Mrs.
Glegg
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
even
a
direct
argument
from
that
typical
Dodson
female
herself
against
his
go
to
law
could
have
heighten
his
disposition
toward
it
so
much
as
the
mere
thought
of
Wakem
,
continually
freshen
by
the
sight
of
the
too
able
attorney
on

<EOS>
Wakem
,
to
his
certain
knowledge

be
(
metaphorically
speak

at
the
bottom
of
Pivart
's
irrigation
;
Wakem
have
try
to
make
dix
stand
out
,
and
go
to
law
about
the
dam

it
be
unquestionably
Wakem
who
have
cause
Mr.

to
lose
the
suit
about
the

all
lawyer
be
more

Wakem

rascality
be
of
that

which
place
itself
in

and
confident
as
Mr.
Tulliver
be
in
his
principle
that
water
be
water
,
and
in
the
direct
inference
that
Pivart
have
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
in
this
affair
of
irrigation
,
he
have
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
Wakem
have
more
law
to
show
against
this
(
rationally
)
irrefragable
inference
than
Gore
could
show
for
it
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
if
they
go
to
law
,
there
be
a
chance
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
employ
Counsellor
Wylde
on
his
side
,
instead
of
have
that
admirable
bully
against
him
;
and
the
prospect
of
see
a
witness
of
Wakem
's
make
to
perspire
and
become
confounded
,
as
Mr.
Tulliver
's
witness
have
once
be
,
be
allure
to
the
love
of
retributive
justice
.
  
<EOS>
much
rumination
have
Mr.
Tulliver
on
these
puzzle
subject
during
his
ride
on
the
gray
horse
;
much
turning
of
the
head
from
side
to
side
,
as
the
scale
dip
alternately
;
but
the
probable
result
be
still
out
of
sight
,
only
to
be
reach
through
much
hot
argument
and
iteration
in
domestic
and
social
life
.
<EOS>
that
initial
stage
of
the
dispute
which
consist
in
the
narration
of
the
case
and
the
enforcement
of
Mr.
Tulliver
's
view
concern
it
throughout
the
entire
circle
of
his
connection
would
necessarily
take
time
;
and
at
the
beginning
of
February
,
when
Tom
be
go
to
school
again
,
there
be
scarcely
any
new
item
to
be
detect
in
his
father
's
statement
of
the
case
against
Pivart
,
or
any
more
specific
indication
of
the
measure
he
be
bent
on
take
against
that
rash
contravener
of
the
principle
that
water
be
water
.
<EOS>
iteration
,
like
friction
,
be
likely
to
generate
heat
instead
of
progress
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
's
heat
be
certainly
more
and
more
palpable
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
no
new
evidence
on
any
other
point
,
there
have
be
new
evidence
that
Pivart
be
as
"
thick
as
mud
"
with
Wakem
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father

Tom

evening
near

It

not

you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
matter

Mr.

after

I

him

It

<EOS>
a
sign
Wakem
think
high

Mr.

as
he

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
in
his
heart
be
rather
proud
of
the
fact
that
his
son
be
to
have
the
same
advantage
as
Wakem
's
;
but
Tom
be
not
at
all
easy
on
the
point
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
much
clear
if
the
lawyer
's
son
have
not
be
deform
,
for
then
Tom
would
have
have
the
prospect
of
pitch
into
him
with
all
that
freedom
which
be
derive
from
a
high
moral
sanction
.
    
<EOS>
the
New
Schoolfellow
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
cold
,
wet
January
day
on
which
Tom
go
back
to
school
;
a
day
quite
in
keeping
with
this
severe
phase
of
his
destiny
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
not
carry
in
his
pocket
a
parcel
of
sugar
-
candy
and
a
small
dutch
doll
for
little
Laura
,
there
would
have
be
no
ray
of
expect
pleasure
to
enliven
the
general
gloom
.
<EOS>
but
he
like
to
think
how
Laura
would
put
out
her
lip
and
her
tiny
hand
for
the
bit
of
sugarcandy
;
and
to
give
the
great
keenness
to
these
pleasure
of
imagination
,
he
take
out
the
parcel
,
make
a
small
hole
in
the
paper
,
and
bite
off
a
crystal
or
two
,
which
have
so
solace
an
effect
under
the
confined
prospect
and
damp
odor
of
the
gig

umbrella
,
that
he
repeat
the
process
more
than
once
on
his
way

<EOS>
"
well

we
be
glad
to

heartily

<EOS>
"
take
off
your

You

"
  
<EOS>
Tom
feel
in
an
uncomfortable
flutter
as
he
take
off
his
woollen
comforter
and
other
wrapping
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
Philip
Wakem
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
but
have
always
turn
his
eye
away
from
him
as
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
dislike
have
a
deform
boy
for
his
companion
,
even
if
Philip
have
not
be
the
son
of
a
bad
man
.
<EOS>
and
Tom
do
not
see
how
a
bad
man
's
son
could
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
His
own
father
be
a
good
man
,
and
he
would
readily
have
fight
any
one
who
say
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
state
of
mingle
embarrassment
and
defiance
as
he
follow
Mr.

to
the

<EOS>
"
here

on
enter

"
Master
Philip
Wakem

<EOS>
I
shall
leave
you
to
make
acquaintance
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
already
know
something
of
each
other
,
I
imagine
;
for
you
be
neighbor
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
look
confused
and
awkward
,
while
Philip
rise
and
glance
at
him
timidly
.
<EOS>
Tom
do
not
like
to
go
up
and
put
out
his
hand
,
and
he
be
not
prepared
to
say
,
"
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
on
so
short
a
notice
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
wisely
turn
away
,
and
close
the
door
behind
him
;
boy
'
shyness
only
wear
off
in
the
absence
of
their
elder
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
at
once
too
proud
and
too
timid
to
walk
toward
Tom
.
<EOS>
He
think
,
or
rather
feel
,
that
Tom
have
an
aversion
to
look
at
him
;
every
one
,
almost
,
dislike
look
at
him
;
and
his
deformity
be
more
conspicuous
when
he
walk
.
<EOS>
so
they
remain
without
shake
hand
or
even
speak
,
while
Tom
go
to
the
fire
and
warm
himself
,
every
now
and
then
cast
furtive
glance
at
Philip
,
who
seem
to
be
draw
absently
first
one
object
<EOS>
and
then
another
on
a
piece
of
paper
he
have
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
seat
himself
again
,
and
as
he
draw
,
be
think
what
he
could
say
to
Tom
,
and
try
to
overcome
his
own
repugnance
to
make
the
first
advance
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
begin
to
look
oftener
and
longer
at
Philip
's
face
,
for
he
could
see
it
without
notice
the
hump
,
and
it
be
really
not
a
disagreeable
face
,
 
very
old
-
look
,
Tom
think
.
<EOS>
He
wonder
how
much
old
Philip
be
than
himself
.
<EOS>
an
anatomist
 
even
a
mere
physiognomist
  
would
have
see
that
the
deformity
of
Philip
's
spine
be
not
a
congenital
hump
,
but
the
result
of
an
accident
in
infancy
;
but
you
do
not
expect
from
Tom
any
acquaintance
with
such
distinction
;
to
him
,
Philip
be
simply
a
humpback
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
vague
notion
that
the
deformity
of
Wakem
's
son
have
some
relation
to
the
lawyer
's
rascality
,
of
which
he
have
so
often
hear
his
father
talk
with
hot
emphasis
;
and
he
feel
,
too
,
a
half
-
admit
fear
of
him
as
probably
a
spiteful
fellow
,
who
,
not
be
able
to
fight
you
,
have
cunning
way
of
do
you
a
mischief
by
the
sly
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
humpbacke
tailor
in
the
neighborhood
of
Mr.
Jacobs
's
academy
,
who
be
consider
a
very
unamiable
character
,
and
be
much
hoot
after
by
public
-
spirit
boy
solely
on
the
ground
of
his
unsatisfactory
moral
quality
;
so
that
Tom
be
not
without
a
basis
of
fact
to
go
upon
.
<EOS>
still
,
no
face
could
be
more
unlike
that
ugly
tailor
's
than
this
melancholy
boy
's
face
,
 
<EOS>
the
brown
hair
round
it
wave
and
curl
at
the
end
like
a
girl
's
<EOS>
;
Tom
think
that
truly
pitiable
.
<EOS>
this
Wakem
be
a
pale
,
puny
fellow
,
and
it
be
quite
clear
he
would
not
be
able
to
play
at
anything
worth
speak
of
;
but
he
handle
his
pencil
in
an
enviable
manner
,
and
be
apparently
make
one
thing
after
another
without
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
what
be
he
draw
?
<EOS>
Tom
be
quite
warm
now
,
and
want
something
new
to
be
go
forward
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
more
agreeable
to
have
an
ill
-
natured
humpback
as
a
companion
than
to
stand
look
out
of
the
study
window
at
the
rain
,
and
kick
his
foot
against
the
washboard
in
solitude
;
something
would
happen
every
day
,
  
"
a
quarrel
or
something
"
;
and
Tom
think
he
should
rather
like
to
show
Philip
that
he
have
well
not
try
his
spiteful
trick
on
_
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
He
suddenly
walk
across
the
hearth
and
look
over
Philip
's
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
be
a
donkey
with
pannier
,
and
a
spaniel
,
and
partridge
in
the
corn
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
his
tongue
be
completely
loose
by
surprise
and
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
my
button
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
draw
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
be
to
learn
draw
this
half
;
I
wonder
if
I
shall
learn
to
make
dog
and
donkey
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
can
do
them
without
learn
,
"
say
Philip
;
"
I
never
learn
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
learn
?
"
say
Tom
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
when
I
make
dog
and
horse
,
and
those
thing
,
the
head
and
the
leg
will
not
come
right
;
though
I
can
see
how
they
ought
to
be
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
house
,
and
all
sort
of
chimney
,
 
chimney
go
all
down
the
wall
,
 
and
window
in
the
roof
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
I
could
do
dog
and
horse
if
I
be
to
try
more
,
"
he
add
,
reflect
that
Philip
may
falsely
suppose
that
he
be
go
to
"
knock
under
,
"
if
he
be
too
frank
about
the
imperfection
of
his
accomplishment

<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
"
say
Philip
,
"
it
be
very
easy
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
look
well
at
thing
,
and
draw
them
over
and
over
again

<EOS>
what
you
do
wrong
once
,
you
can
alter
the
next

<EOS>
"
but
have
not
you
be
teach
_
any_thing

"
say
Tom
,
begin
to
have
a
puzzle
suspicion
that
Philip
's
crooked
back
may
be
the
source
of
remarkable
faculty
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
be

a
long
while

<EOS>
"
yes

Philip

smile

say
Tom

lower
his

confidentially

"
pretty

I
do
not

much
about
it

Philip

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
perhaps
you
have
not

into
the
_

Tom
,
nod
his
head
sideways

as
much
as

<EOS>
Philip
feel
some
bitter
complacency
in
the
promising
stupidity
of
this
well

make

active

looking
boy
;
but
make
polite
by
his
own
extreme
sensitiveness
,
as
well
as
by
his
desire
to
conciliate
,
he
check
his
inclination
to
laugh
,
and
say
quietly
,
    
"
I
have
do
with
the
grammar
;
I
do
not
learn

any
more

then

with

disappointment

no

Tom
do
not

for
he
be
quite
absorb
in
the
thought

spiteful

He
find
much
difficulty
in
adjust
his

occur

him
that

there
be
very

about

<EOS>
Tom
,
in
his
turn
,
wish
to
make
the
balance
dip
in

favor

<EOS>
this
hunchback
must
not
suppose
that
his
acquaintance
with
fight
story
put
him
on
a
par
with
an
actual
fighting
hero
,
like
Tom
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Philip
wince
under
this
allusion
to
his
unfitness
for
active
sport
,
and
he
answer
almost
peevishly
,
    
"
I
can
not
bear
fish
.
<EOS>
I
think
people
look
like
fool
sit
watch
a
line
hour
after
hour
,
or
else
throw
and
throw
,
and
catch
nothing

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
you
would
not
say
they
look
like
fool
when
they
land
a
big
pike
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
say
Tom
,
who
have
never
catch
anything
that
be
"
big
"
in
his
life
,
but
whose
imagination
be
on
the
stretch
with
indignant
zeal
for
the
honor
of
sport
.
<EOS>
Wakem
's
son
,
it
be
plain
,
have
his
disagreeable
point
,
and
must
be
keep
in
due
check
.
<EOS>
happily
for
the
harmony
of
this
first
interview
,
they
be
now
call
to
dinner
,
and
Philip
be
not
allow
to
develop
farther
his
unsound
view
on
the
subject
of
fishing
.
<EOS>
but
Tom
say
to
himself
,
that
be
just
what
he
should
have
expect
from
a
hunchback
.
    
<EOS>
"
the
Young
idea
"
  
<EOS>
the
alteration
of
feeling
in
that
first
dialogue
between
Tom
and
Philip
continue
to
make
their
intercourse
even
after
many
week
of
schoolboy
intimacy
.
<EOS>
Tom
never
quite
lose
the
feeling
that
Philip
,
be
the
son
of
a
"
rascal
,
"
be
his
natural
enemy
;
never
thoroughly
overcome
his
repulsion
to
Philip
's
deformity
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
boy
who
adhere
tenaciously
to
impression
once
receive
;
as
with
all
mind
in
which
mere
perception
predominate
over
thought
and
emotion
,
the
external
remain
to
him
rigidly
what
it
be
in
the
first
instance
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
be
impossible
not
to
like
Philip
's
company
when
he
be
in
a
good
humor
;
he
could
help
one
so
well
in
one
's
latin
exercise
,
which
Tom
regard
as
a
kind
of
puzzle
that
could
only
be
find
out
by
a
lucky
chance
;
and
he
could
tell
such
wonderful
fighting
story
about
Hal
of
the
Wynd
,
for
example
,
and
other
hero
who
be
especial
favorite
with
Tom
,
because
they
lay
about
them
with
heavy
stroke
.
<EOS>
He
have
small
opinion
of
Saladin
,
whose
cimeter
could
cut
a
cushion
in
two
in
an
instant
;
who
want
to
cut
cushion
?
<EOS>
that
be
a
stupid
story
,
and
he
do
not
care
to
hear
it
again
.
<EOS>
but
when
Robert
Bruce
,
on
the
black
pony
,
rise
in
his
stirrup
,
and
lift
his
good
battle
-
axe
,
crack
at
once
the
helmet
and
the
skull
of
the
too
hasty
knight
at
Bannockburn
,
then
Tom
feel
all
the
exaltation
of
sympathy
,
and
if
he
have
have
a
cocoanut
at
hand
,
he
would
have
crack
it
at
once
with
the
poker
.
<EOS>
Philip
in
his
happy
mood
indulge
Tom
to
the
top
of
his
bent
,
heighten
the
crash
and
bang
and
fury
of
every
fight
with
all
the
artillery
of
epithet
and
simile
at
his
command
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
always
in
a
good
humor
or
happy
mood
.
<EOS>
the
slight
spurt
of
peevish
susceptibility
which
have
escape
him
in
their
first
interview
be
a
symptom
of
a
perpetually
recur
mental
ailment
,
half
of
it
nervous
irritability
,
half
of
it
the
heart
-
bitterness
produce
by
the
sense
of
his
deformity
.
<EOS>
in
these
fit
of
susceptibility
every
glance
seem
to
him
to
be
charge
either
with
offensive
pity
or
with
ill
-
repress
disgust
;
at
the
very
least
it
be
an
indifferent
glance
,
and
Philip
feel
indifference
as
a
child
of
the
south
feel
the
chill
air
of
a
northern
spring
.
<EOS>
poor
Tom
's
blunder
patronage
when
they
be
out
of
door
together
would
sometimes
make
him
turn
upon
the
well
-
mean
lad
quite
savagely
;
and
his
eye
,
usually
sad
and
quiet
,
would
flash
with
anything
but
playful
lightning
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
Tom
retain
his
suspicion
of
the
humpback
.
  
<EOS>
but
Philip
's
self
-
taught
skill
in
drawing
be
another
link
between
them
;
for
Tom
find
,
to
his
disgust
,
that
his
new
drawing
-
master
give
him
no
dog
and
donkey
to
draw
,
but
brooks
and
rustic
bridge
and
ruin
,
all
with
a
general
softness
of
black
-
lead
surface
,
indicate
that
nature
,
if
anything
,
be
rather
satiny
;
and
as
Tom
's
feeling
for
the
picturesque
in
landscape
be
at
present
quite
latent
,
it
be
not
surprising
that
Mr.
Goodrich
's
production
seem
to
him
an
uninteresting
form
of
art
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
have
a
vague
intention
that
Tom
should
be
put
to
some
business
which
include
the
drawing
out
of
plan
and
map
,
have
complain
to
Mr.
Riley
,
when
he
see
him
at
Mudport
,
that
Tom
seem
to
be
learn
nothing
of
that
sort
<EOS>
;
whereupon
that
oblige
adviser
have
suggest
that
Tom
should
have
drawing
-
lesson
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
must
not
mind
pay
extra
for
drawing
;
let
Tom
be
make
a
good
draughtsman
,
and
he
would
be
able
to
turn
his
pencil
to
any
purpose
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
order
that
Tom
should
have
drawing
-
lesson
;
and
whom
should
Mr.
Stelling
have
select
as
a
master
if
not
Mr.
Goodrich
,
who
be
consider
quite
at
the
head
of
his
profession
within
a
circuit
of
twelve
mile
round
King
's
Lorton
?
<EOS>
by
which
mean
Tom
learn
to
make
an
extremely
fine
point
to
his
pencil
,
and
to
represent
landscape
with
a
"
broad
generality
,
"
which
,
doubtless
from
a
narrow
tendency
in
his
mind
to
detail
,
he
think
extremely
dull
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
,
you
remember
,
happen
in
those
dark
age
when
there
be
no
school
of
design
;
before
schoolmaster
be
invariably
man
of
scrupulous
integrity
,
and
before
the
clergy
be
all
man
of
enlarged
mind
and
varied
culture
.
<EOS>
in
those
less
favored
day
,
it
be
no
fable
that
there
be
other
clergyman
besides
Mr.
Stelling
who
have
narrow
intellect
and
large
want
,
and
whose
income
,
by
a
logical
confusion
to
which
<EOS>
Fortune
,
be
a
female
as
well
as
blindfold
,
be
peculiarly
liable
,
be
proportion
not
to
their
want
but
to
their
intellect
,
with
which
income
have
clearly
no
inherent
relation
.
<EOS>
the
problem
these
gentleman
have
to
solve
be
to
readjust
the
proportion
between
their
want
and
their
income
;
and
since
want
be
not
easily
starve
to
death
,
the
simple
method
appear
to
be
to
raise
their
income
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
way
of
do
this
;
any
of
those
low
calling
in
which
man
be
oblige
to
do
good
work
at
a
low
price
be
forbid
to
clergyman
;
be
it
their
fault
if
their
only
resource
be
to
turn
out
very
poor
work
at
a
high
price
?
<EOS>
besides
,
how
should
Mr.
stelle
be
expect
to
know
that
education
be
a
delicate
and
difficult
business
,
any
more
than
an
animal
endow
with
a
power
of
bore
a
hole
through
a
rock
should
be
expect
to
have
wide
view
of
excavation
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
's
faculty
have
be
early
train
to
bore
in
a
straight
line
,
and
he
have
no
faculty
to
spare
.
<EOS>
but
among
Tom
's
contemporary
,
whose
father
cast
their
son
on
clerical
instruction
to
find
them
ignorant
after
many
day
,
there
be
many
far
less
lucky
than
Tom
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Education
be
almost
entirely
a
matter
of
luck
 
usually
of
ill
-
luck
 
in
those
distant
day
.
<EOS>
the
state
of
mind
in
which
you
take
a
billiard
-
cue
or
a
dice
-
box
in
your
hand
be
one
of
sober
certainty
compare
with
that
of
old
-
fashioned
father
,
like
Mr.
Tulliver
,
when
they
select
a
school
or
a
tutor
for
their
son

<EOS>
excellent
man
,
who
have
be

all
their
life
to
spell
on
an
impromptu
-
phonetic
system
,
and
have
carry
on
a
successful
business
in
spite
of
this
disadvantage
,
have
acquire
money
enough
to
give
their
son
a
well
start
in
life
than
they
have
have
themselves
,
must
necessarily
take
their
chance
as
to
the
conscience
and
the
competence
of
the
schoolmaster
whose
circular
fall
in
their
way
,
and
appear
to
promise
so
much
more
than
they
would
ever
have
think
of
ask
for
,
include
the
return
of
linen
,
fork
,
and
spoon

<EOS>
It
be
happy
for
them
if
some
ambitious
draper
of
their
acquaintance
have
not
bring
up
his
son
to
the
Church
,
and
if
that
young
gentleman
,
at
the
age
of
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
have
not
close
his
college
dissipation
by
an
imprudent
marriage
;
otherwise
,
these
innocent

desirous
of

as

where
two

the
advantage

,
then
,
compare
with
many
other
british
youth
of
his
time
who
have
since
have
to
scramble
through
life
with
some
fragment
of
more
or
less
relevant
knowledge
,
and
a
great
deal
of
strictly
relevant
ignorance
,
be
not
so
very
unlucky
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
be
a
broad
-
cheste
,
healthy
man
,
with
the
bearing
of
a
gentleman
,
a
conviction
that
a
grow
boy
require
a
sufficiency
of
beef
,
and
a
certain
hearty
kindness
in
him
that
make
him
like
to
see
Tom
look
well
and
enjoy
his
dinner
;
not
a
man
of
refined
conscience
,
or
with
any
deep
sense
of
the
infinite
issue
belong
to
every
-
day
duty
,
not
quite
competent
to
his
high
office
;
but
incompetent
gentleman
must
live
,
and
without
private
fortune
it
be
difficult
to
see
how
they
could
all
live
genteelly
if
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
education
or
government
.
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
the
fault
of
Tom
's
mental
constitution
that
his
faculty
could
not
be
nourish
on
the
sort
of
knowledge
Mr.
Stelling
have
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
a
boy
bear
with
a
deficient
power
of
apprehending
sign
and
abstraction
must
suffer
the
penalty
of
his
congenital
deficiency
,
just
as
if
he
have
be
bear
with
one
leg
short
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
a
method
of
education
sanction
by
the
long
practice
of
our
venerable
ancestor
be
not
to
give
way
before
the
exceptional
dulness
of
a
boy
who
be
merely
live
at
the
time
then
present
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Stelling
be
convince
that
a
boy
so
stupid
at
sign
and
abstraction
must
be
stupid
at
everything
else
,
even
if
that
reverend
gentleman
could
have
teach
him
everything
else
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
practice
of
our
venerable
ancestor
to
apply
that
ingenious
instrument
the
thumb
-
screw
,
and
to
tighten
and
tighten
it
in
order
to
elicit
non
-
existent
fact
;
they
have
a
fix
opinion
to
begin
with
,
that
the
fact
be
existent
,
and
what
have
they
to
do
but
to
tighten
the
thumb
-
screw
?
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
Mr.
Stelling
have
a
fix
opinion
that
all
boy
with
any
capacity
could
learn
what
it
be
the
only
regular
thing
to
teach
;
if
they
be
slow
,
the
thumb
-
screw
must
be
tighten
,
 
the
exercise
must
be
insist
on
with
increase
severity
,
and
a
page
of
Virgil
be
award
as
a
penalty
,
to
encourage
and
stimulate
a
too
languid
inclination
to
Latin
verse
.
  
<EOS>
the
thumb
-
screw
be
a
little
relaxed
,
however
,
during
this
second
half
-
year
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
so
advanced
in
his
study
,
and
so
apt
,
that
Mr.
Stelling
could
obtain
credit
by
his
facility
,
which
require
little
help
,
much
more
easily
than
by
the
troublesome
process
of
overcome
Tom
's
dulness
.
<EOS>
gentleman
with
broad
chest
and
ambitious
intention
do
sometimes
disappoint
their
friend
by
fail
to
carry
the
world
before
them
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
that
high
achievement
demand
some
other
unusual
qualification
besides
an
unusual
desire
for
high
prize
;
perhaps
it
be
that
these
stalwart
gentleman
be
rather
indolent
,
their
_
divinæ
particulum
auræ
_
be
obstruct
from
soar
by
a
too
hearty
appetite
.
<EOS>
some
reason
or
other
there
be
why
Mr.
Stelling
defer
the
execution
of
many
spirit
project
,
 
why
he
do
not
begin
the
editing
of
his
Greek
play
,
or
any
other
work
of
scholarship
,
in
his
leisure
hour
,
but
,
after
turn
the
key
of
his
private
study
with
much
resolution
,
sit
down
to
one
of
Theodore
Hook
's
novel
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
gradually
allow
to
shuffle
through
his
lesson
with
less
rigor
,
and
have
Philip
to
help
him
,
he
be
able
to
make
some
show
of
have
apply
his
mind
in
a
confused
and
blunder
way
,
without
be
cross
-
examine
into
a
betrayal
that
his
mind
have
be
entirely
neutral
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
think
school
much
more
bearable
under
this
modification
of
circumstance
;
and
he
go
on
contentedly
enough
,
pick
up
a
promiscuous
education
chiefly
from
thing
that
be
not
intend
as
education
at
all
.
<EOS>
what
be
understand
to
be
his
education
be
simply
the
practice
of
reading
,
writing
,
and
spelling
,
carry
on
by
an
elaborate
appliance
of
unintelligible
idea
,
and
by
much
failure
in
the
effort
to
learn
by
rote
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
be
a
visible
improvement
in
Tom
under
this
training
;
perhaps
because
he
be
not
a
boy
in
the
abstract
,
exist
solely
to
illustrate
the
evil
of
a
mistaken
education
,
but
a
boy
make
of
flesh
and
blood
,
with
disposition
not
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
improvement
in
his
bearing
,
for
example
;
and
some
credit
on
this
score
be
due
to
Mr.
Poulter
,
the
village
schoolmaster
,
who
,
be
an
old
Peninsular
soldier
,
be
employ
to
drill
Tom
,
 
a
source
of
high
mutual
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poulter
,
who
be
understand
by
the
company
at
the
Black
Swan
to
have
once
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
the
French
,
be
no
longer
personally
formidable
.
<EOS>
He
have
rather
a
shrunken
appearance
,
and
be
tremulous
in
the
morning
,
not
from
age
,
but
from
the
extreme
perversity
of
the
King
's
Lorton
boy
,
which
nothing
but
gin
could
enable
him
to
sustain
with
any
firmness
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
carry
himself
with
martial
erectness
,
have
his
clothe
scrupulously
brush
,
and
his
trouser
tightly
strap
;
and
on
the
Wednesday
and
Saturday
afternoon
,
when
he
come
to
Tom
,
he
be
always
inspire
with
gin
and
old
memory
,
which
give
him
an
exceptionally
spirit
air
,
as
of
a
superannuated
charger
who
hear
the
drum
.
<EOS>
the
drilling
-
lesson
be
always
protract
by
episode
of
warlike
narrative
,
much
more
interesting
to
Tom
than
Philip
's
story
out
of
the
Iliad
;
for
there
be
no
cannon
in
the
Iliad
,
and
besides
,
Tom
have
feel
some
disgust
on
learn
that
Hector
and
Achilles
may
possibly
never
have
exist
.
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
of
Wellington
be
really
alive
,
and
Bony
have
not
be
long
dead
;
therefore
Mr.
Poulter
's
reminiscence
of
the
Peninsular
War
be
remove
from
all
suspicion
of
be
mythical
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poulter
,
it
appear
,
have
be
a
conspicuous
figure
at
Talavera
,
and
have
contribute
not
a
little
to
the
peculiar
terror
with
which
his
regiment
of
infantry
be
regard
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
on
afternoon
when
his
memory
be
more
stimulated
than
usual
,
he
remember
that
the
Duke
of
Wellington
have
(
in
strict
privacy
,
lest
jealousy
should
be
awaken
)
<EOS>
express
his
esteem
for
that
fine
fellow
Poulter
.
<EOS>
the
very
surgeon
who
attend
him
in
the
hospital
after
he
have
receive
his
gunshot
-
wound
have
be
profoundly
impressed
with
the
superiority
of
Mr.
Poulter
's
flesh
,
 
no
other
flesh
would
have
heal
in
anything
like
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
on
less
personal
matter
connect
with
the
important
warfare
in
which
he
have
be
engage
,
Mr.
Poulter
be
more
reticent
,
only
take
care
not
to
give
the
weight
of
his
authority
to
any
loose
notion
concern
military
history
.
<EOS>
any
one
who
pretend
to
a
knowledge
of
what
occur
at
the
siege
of
Badajos
be
especially
an
object
of
silent
pity
to
Mr.
Poulter
;
he
wish
that
prate
person
have
be
run
down
,
and
have
the
breath
trample
out
of
him
at
the
first
go
-
off
,
as
he
himself
have
,
 
he
may
talk
about
the
siege
of
Badajos
then
!
<EOS>
Tom
do
not
escape
irritate
his
drilling
-
master
occasionally
,
by
his
curiosity
concern
other
military
matter
than
Mr.
Poulter
's
personal
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
General
Wolfe
,
Mr.
Poulter
,
 
be
not
he
a
wonderful
fighter
?
"
say
Tom
,
who
hold
the
notion
that
all
the
martial
hero
commemorate
on
the
public
-
house
sign
be
engage
in
the
war
with
Bony
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
!
"
say
Mr.
Poulter
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nothing
o

the
sort
!
<EOS>
head
up
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
in
a
tone
of
stern
command
,
which
delight
Tom
,
and
make
him
feel
as
if
he
be
a
regiment
in
his
own
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Poulter
would
continue
,
on
come
to
a
pause
in
his
discipline
;
"
they
would
better
not
talk
to
me
about
General
Wolfe
.
<EOS>
He
do
nothing
but
die
of
his
wound

that
be
a
poor
haction

I

<EOS>
"
Mr.

,
"
Tom
would
say
,
at
any
allusion
to
the
sword
,
"
I
wish
you
would
bring
your
sword
and
do
the
sword
-
exercise
!
"
  
<EOS>
for
a
long
while
Mr.
Poulter
only
shake
his
head
in
a
significant
manner
at
this
request
,
and
smile
patronizingly
,
as
Jupiter
may
have
do
when
Semele
urge
her
too
ambitious
request
.
<EOS>
but
one
afternoon
,
when
a
sudden
shower
of
heavy
rain
have
detain
Mr.
Poulter
twenty
minute
long
than
usual
at
the
Black
Swan
,
the
sword
be
bring

just
for
Tom
to
look
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
this
be
the
real
sword
you

with
in
all
the
battle

Mr.

Tom

it

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
I

should
like
the

<EOS>
Tom
give
the
requisite
pantomime
to
indicate
the
double
enjoyment
of
pull
the
trigger
and
thrust
the
spear
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,

the

the

Mr.

involuntarily
fall
in
with
Tom

and
draw
the

so
suddenly
that
Tom
leap

with
much
agility

"

Mr.

a

conscious
that
he
have
not

as
become
an

up

something
to

to
prevent

from

he
be
afraid
of

proposition
to

though
he

shudder
visibly

for

<EOS>
"
and
what
be
you
in
trouble
about
?
"
say
Mrs.
Stelling
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
not
her
favorite
of
the
two
pupil
;
he
be
less
obliging
than
Tom
,
who
be
make
useful
in
many
way
.
<EOS>
still
,
his
father
pay
more
than
Mr.
Tulliver
do
,
and
she
mean
him
to
feel
that
she
behave
exceedingly
well
to
him
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
however
,
meet
her
advance
toward
a
good
understanding
very
much
as
a
caressed
mollusk
meet
an
invitation
to
show
himself
out
of
his
shell
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Stelling
be
not
a
loving
,
tender
-
hearted
woman
;
she
be
a
woman
whose
skirt
sit
well
,
who
adjust
her
waist
and
pat
her
curl
with
a
preoccupied
air
when
she
inquire
after
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
these
thing
,
doubtless
,
represent
a
great
social
power
,
but
it
be
not
the
power
of
love
;
and
no
other
power
could
win
Philip
from
his
personal
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
in
answer
to
her
question
,
"
My
toothache
come
on
,
and
make
me
hysterical
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
have
be
the
fact
once
,
and
Philip
be
glad
of
the
recollection
;
it
be
like
an
inspiration
to
enable
him
to
excuse
his
crying
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
accept
eau
-
de
-
Cologne
and
to
refuse
creosote
in
consequence
;
but
that
be
easy
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
Tom
,
who
have
for
the
first
time
send
a
poison
arrow
into
Philip
's
heart
,
have
return
to
the
carriage
-
house
,
where
he
find
Mr.
Poulter
,
with
a
fix
and
earnest
eye
,
waste
the
perfection
of
his
sword
-
exercise
on
probably
observant
but
inappreciative
rat
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Poulter
be
a
host
in
himself
;
that
be
to
say
,
he
admire
himself
more
than
a
whole
army
of
spectator
could
have
admire
him
.
<EOS>
He
take
no
notice
of
Tom
's
return
,
be
too
entirely
absorb
in
the
cut
and
thrust
,
 
the
solemn
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
;
and
Tom
,
not
without
a
slight
feeling
of
alarm
at
Mr.
Poulter
's
fix
eye
and
hungry
-
looking
sword
,
which
seem
impatient
for
something
else
to
cut
besides
the
air
,
admire
the
performance
from
as
great
a
distance
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
Mr.
Poulter
pause
and
wipe
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
,
that
Tom
feel
the
full
charm
of
the
sword
-
exercise
,
and
wish
it
to
be
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Poulter
,
"
say
Tom
,
when
the
sword
be
be
finally
sheathe
,
"
I
wish
you
would
lend
me
your
sword
a
little
while
to
keep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
no
,
young
gentleman
,
"
say
Mr.
Poulter
,
shake
his
head
decidedly
;
"
you
may
do
yourself
some
mischief
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
sure
I
would
not
;
I
be
sure
I
would
take
care
and
not
hurt
myself
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
take
it
out
of
the
sheath
much
,
but
I
could
ground
arm
with
it
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
it
will
not
do
,
I
tell
you
;
it
will
not
do
,
"
say
Mr.
Poulter
,
prepare
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
'
ud
Mr.
Stelling
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
say
,
do
,
Mr.
Poulter
!
<EOS>
I
would
give
you
my
five
-
shill
piece
if
you
would
let
me
keep
the
sword
a
week
.
<EOS>
look
here
!
"
say
Tom
,
reach
out
the
attractively
large
round
of
silver
.
<EOS>
the
young
dog
calculate
the
effect
as
well
as
if
he
have
be
a
philosopher
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Poulter
,
with
still
deep
gravity
,
"
you
must
keep
it
out
of
sight
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
I
will
keep
it
under
the
bed
,
"
say
Tom
,
eagerly
,
"
or
else
at
the
bottom
of
my
large
box
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
let
me
see
,
now
,
whether
you
can
draw
it
out
of
the
sheath
without
hurt
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
that
process
have
be
go
through
more
than
once
,
Mr.
Poulter
feel
that
he
have
act
with
scrupulous
conscientiousness
,
and
say
,
"
well
,
now
,
Master
Tulliver
,
if
I
take
the
crown
-
piece
,
it
be
to
make
sure
as
you
will
do
no
mischief
with
the
sword
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Poulter
,
"
say
Tom
,
delightedly
hand
him
the
crown
-
piece
,
and
grasp
the
sword
,
which
,
he
think
,
may
have
be
light
with
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
Mr.
Stelling
catch
you
carry
it
in
?
"
say
Mr.
Poulter
,
pocket
the
crown
-
piece
provisionally
while
he
raise
this
new
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
always
keep
in
his
upstairs
study
on
Saturday
afternoon
,
"
say
Tom
,
who
dislike
anything
sneak
,
but
be
not
disincline
to
a
little
stratagem
in
a
worthy
cause
.
<EOS>
so
he
carry
off
the
sword
in
triumph
mix
with
dread
 
dread
that
he
may
encounter
Mr.
or
Mrs.
stelle
 
to
his
bedroom
,
<EOS>
where
,
after
some
consideration
,
he
hide
it
in
the
closet
behind
some
hang
clothe
.
<EOS>
that
night
he
fall
asleep
in
the
thought
that
he
would
astonish
Maggie
with
it
when
she
come
,
 
<EOS>
tie
it
round
his
waist
with
his
red
comforter
,
and
make
her
believe
that
the
sword
be
his
own
,
and
that
he
be
go
to
be
a
soldier
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
but
Maggie
who
would
be
silly
enough
to
believe
him
,
or
whom
he
dare
allow
to
know
he
have
a
sword
;
and
Maggie
be
really
come
next
week
to
see
Tom
,
before
she
go
to
a
boarding
-
school
with
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
think
a
lad
of
thirteen
would
have
be
so
childish
,
you
must
be
an
exceptionally
wise
man
,
who
,
although
you
be
devoted
to
a
civil
calling
,
require
you
to
look
bland
rather
than
formidable
,
yet
never
,
since
you
have
a
beard
,
throw
yourself
into
a
martial
attitude
,
and
frown
before
the
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
It
be
doubtful
whether
our
soldier
would
be
maintain
if
there
be
not
pacific
people
at
home
who
like
to
fancy
themselves
soldier
.
<EOS>
war
,
like
other
dramatic
spectacle
,
may
possibly
cease
for
want
of
a
"
public
.
"
    
<EOS>
Maggie
's
second
visit
  
<EOS>
this
last
breach
between
the
two
lad
be
not
readily
mend
,
and
for
some
time
they
speak
to
each
other
no
more
than
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
Their
natural
antipathy
of
temperament
make
resentment
an
easy
passage
to
hatred
,
and
in
Philip
the
transition
seem
to
have
begin
;
there
be
no
malignity
in
his
disposition
,
but
there
be
a
susceptibility
that
make
him
peculiarly
liable
to
a
strong
sense
of
repulsion
.
<EOS>
the
ox
 
<EOS>
we
may
venture
to
assert
it
on
the
authority
of
a
great
classic
 
be
not
give
to
use
his
tooth
as
an
instrument
of
attack
,
and
Tom
be
an
excellent
bovine
lad
,
who
run
at
questionable
object
in
a
truly
ingenious
bovine
manner
;
but
he
have
blunder
on
Philip
's
tender
point
,
and
have
cause
him
as
much
acute
pain
as
if
he
have
study
the
mean
with
the
nice
precision
and
the
most
envenomed
spite
.
<EOS>
Tom
see
no
reason
why
they
should
not
make
up
this
quarrel
as
they
have
do
many
other
,
by
behave
as
if
nothing
have
happen
;
for
though
he
have
never
before
say
to
Philip
that
his
father
be
a
rogue
,
this
idea
have
so
habitually
make
part
of
his
feeling
as
to
the
relation
between
himself
and
his
dubious
schoolfellow
,
who
he
could
neither
like
nor
dislike
,
that
the
mere
utterance
do
not
make
such
an
epoch
to
him
as
it
do
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
a
right
to
say
so
when
Philip
hector
over
_
him
_
,
and
call
him
name
.
<EOS>
but
perceive
that
his
first
advance
toward
amity
be
not
meet
,
he
relapse
into
his
least
favorable
disposition
toward
Philip
,
and
resolve
never
to
appeal
to
him
either
about
drawing
or
exercise
again
.
<EOS>
They
be
only
so
far
civil
to
each
other
as
be
necessary
to
prevent
their
state
of
feud
from
be
observe
by
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
would
have
"
put
down
"
such
nonsense
with
great
vigor
.
  
<EOS>
when
Maggie
come
,
however
,
she
could
not
help
look
with
grow
interest
at
the
new
schoolfellow
,
although
he
be
the
son
of
that
wicked
Lawyer
Wakem
,
who
make
her
father
so
angry
.
<EOS>
She
have
arrive
in
the
middle
of
school
-
hour
,
and
have
sit
by
while
Philip
go
through
his
lesson
with
Mr.
Stelling
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
some
week
ago
,
have
send
her
word
that
Philip
know
no
end
of
story
,
 
not
stupid
story
like
her
;
and
she
be
convince
now
from
her
own
observation
that
he
must
be
very
clever
;
she
hope
he
would
think
_
her
_
rather
clever
too
,
when
she
come
to
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
moreover
,
have
rather
a
tenderness
for
deformed
thing
;
she
prefer
the
wry
-
necked
lamb
,
because
it
seem
to
her
that
the
lamb
which
be
quite
strong
and
well
make
would
not
mind
so
much
about
be
pet
;
and
she
be
especially
fond
of
petting
object
that
would
think
it
very
delightful
to
be
pet
by
her
.
<EOS>
She
love
Tom
very
dearly
,
but
she
often
wish
that
he
_
care
_
more
about
her
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Philip
Wakem
seem
a
nice
boy
,
Tom
,
"
she
say
,
when
they
go
out
of
the
study
together
into
the
garden
,
to
pass
the
interval
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
not
choose
his
father
,
you
know
;
and
I
have
read
of
very
bad
man
who
have
good
son
,
as
well
as
good
parent
who
have
bad
child
.
<EOS>
and
if
Philip
be
good
,
I
think
we
ought
to
be
the
more
sorry
for
him
because
his
father
be
not
a
good
man
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
<EOS>
like
him
,
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
be
a
queer
fellow
,
"
say
Tom
,
curtly
,
"
and
he
be
as
sulky
as
can
be
with
me
,
because
I
tell
him
his
father
be
a
rogue
.
<EOS>
and
I
would
a
right
to
tell
him
so
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
true
;
and
_
he
_
begin
it
,
with
call
me
name
.
<EOS>
but
you
stop
here
by
yourself
a
bit
,
Maggie
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
have
get
something
I
want
to
do
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
can
not
I
go
too
?
<EOS>
"
say
Maggie
,
who
in
this
first
day
of
meeting
again
love
Tom
's
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
something
I
will
tell
you
about
by
-
and
-
by
,
not
yet

say
Tom
,
skip
away
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
the
boy
be
at
their
book
in
the
study
,
prepare
the
morrow
's
lesson
be
that
they
may
have
a
holiday
in
the
evening
in
honor
of
Maggie
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
hang
over
his
Latin
grammar
,
move
his
lip
inaudibly
like
a
strict
but
impatient
catholic
repeat
his
tale
of
paternoster
;
and
Philip
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
be
busy
with
two
volume
,
with
a
look
of
contented
diligence
that
excite
Maggie
's
curiosity
;
he
do
not
look
at
all
as
if
he
be
learn
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
She
sit
on
a
low
stool
at
nearly
a
right
angle
with
the
two
boy
,
watch
first
one
<EOS>
and
then
the
other
;
and
Philip
,
look
off
his
book
once
toward
the
fire
-
place
,
catch
the
pair
of
question
dark
eye
fix
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
think
this
sister
of
Tulliver
's
seem
a
nice
little
thing
,
quite
unlike
her
brother
;
he
wish
_
<EOS>
he
_
have
a
little
sister
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
,
he
wonder
,
that
make
Maggie
's
dark
eye
remind
him
of
the
story
about
princess
be
turn
into
animal
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
that
her
eye
be
full
of
unsatisfied
intelligence
,
and
unsatisfied
beseech
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Magsie
,
"
say
Tom
at
last
,
shut
his
book
and
put
them
away
with
the
energy
and
decision
of
a
perfect
master
in
the
art
of
leave
off
,
"
I
have
do
my
lesson
now

<EOS>
come
upstairs
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
say
Maggie
,
when
they
be
outside
the
door
,
a
slight
suspicion
cross
her
mind
as
she
remember
Tom
's
preliminary
visit
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
a
trick
you
be
go
to
play
me
,
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no

Maggie

say
Tom
,
in
his
most
coaxing
tone
;
"
It
be
something
you
will
like

ever
so

<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
she
put
hers
round
his
waist
,
and
twine
together
in
this
way
,
they
go
upstairs

<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Magsie
,
you
must
not
tell
anybody
,
you
know

Tom
,
"
else
I
shall
get
fifty
line

<EOS>
"
be
it
alive

say
Maggie
,
whose
imagination
have
settle
for
the
moment
on
the
idea
that
Tom
keep
a
ferret
clandestinely
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
sha'n"t
tell
you
,
"
say
he
.
"
<EOS>
now
you
go
into
that
corner
and
hide
your
face

while
I
reach
it
out

he
add
,
as
he
lock
the
bedroom
door
behind
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
when
to
turn
round

<EOS>
You
must
not
squeal
out

"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

but
if
you
frighten
me

I
shall

Maggie
,
begin
to
look
rather
serious
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
frightened

you
silly
thing

"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
go

disdainfully

bury
her
face
in
the
pillow
like
a
person
of
strict
honor

<EOS>
but
Tom
look
round
warily
as
he
walk
to
the
closet
;
then
he
step
into
the
narrow
space
,
and
almost
close
the
door
.
<EOS>
Maggie
keep
her
face
bury
without
the
aid
of
principle
,
for
in
that
dream
-
suggestive
attitude
she
have
soon
forget
where
she
be
,
and
her
thought
be
busy
with
the
poor
deform
boy
,
who
be
so
clever
,
when
Tom
call
out
,
"
now
then
,
Magsie
!
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
but
long
meditation
and
preconcerte
arrangement
of
effect
would
have
enable
Tom
to
present
so
strike
a
figure
as
he
do
to
Maggie
when
she
look
up
.
<EOS>
dissatisfy
with
the
pacific
aspect
of
a
face
which
have
no
more
than
the
faint
hint
of
flaxen
eyebrow
,
together
with
a
pair
of
amiable
blue
-
gray
eye
and
round
pink
cheek
that
refuse
to
look
formidable
,
let
him
frown
as
he
would
before
the
looking
-
glass
(
Philip
have
once
tell
him
of
a
man
who
have
a
horseshoe
frown
,
and
Tom
have
try
with
all
his
frowning
might
to
make
a
horseshoe
on
his
forehead
)
,
he
have
have
recourse
to
that
unfailing
source
of
the
terrible
,
burn
cork
,
and
have
make
himself
a
pair
of
black
eyebrow
that
meet
in
a
satisfactory
manner
over
his
nose
,
and
be
match
by
a
less
carefully
adjust
blackness
about
the
chin
.
<EOS>
He
have
wind
a
red
handkerchief
round
his
cloth
cap
to
give
it
the
air
of
a
turban
,
and
his
red
comforter
across
his
breast
as
a
scarf
,
 
an
amount
of
red
which
,
with
the
tremendous
frown
on
his
brow
,
and
the
decision
with
which
he
grasp
the
sword
,
as
he
hold
it
with
its
point
rest
on
the
ground
,
would
suffice
to
convey
an
approximate
idea
of
his
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
look
bewilder
for
a
moment
,
and
Tom
enjoy
that
moment
keenly
;
but
in
the
next
she
laugh
,
clap
her
hand
together
,
and
say
,
"
oh
,
Tom
,
you
have
make
yourself
like
Bluebeard
at
the
show
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
clear
she
have
not
be
strike
with
the
presence
of
the
sword
,
 
it
be
not
unsheathed
.
<EOS>
Her
frivolous
mind
require
a
more
direct
appeal
to
its
sense
of
the
terrible
,
and
Tom
prepare
for
his
master
-
stroke
.
<EOS>
frown
with
a
double
amount
of
intention
,
if
not
of
corrugation
,
he
(
carefully
)
draw
the
sword
from
its
sheath
,
and
point
it
at
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Tom
,
please
do
not
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Maggie
,
in
a
tone
of
suppress
dread

away
from
him
into
the
opposite
corner

<EOS>
the
corner
of
Tom

show
an
inclination
to
a
smile
of
complacency
that
be
immediately
check
as
inconsistent
with
the
severity
of
a
great
warrior

<EOS>
slowly
he
let
down
the
scabbard
on
the
floor
,
lest
it
should
make
too
much
noise
,
and

sternly

with

to

<EOS>
the

and
in

Maggie
leap
from

,
still
shriek
,
and
immediately
there
be
a
rush
of
footstep
toward
the

He

and
yet
she

him
,
as

<EOS>
in
another
minute
she
be
sob
with
joy
because
Tom

his
eye
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
sorrow

a
Love

Scene
  
<EOS>
Poor
Tom
bear
his
severe
pain
heroically
,
and
be
resolute
in
not
"
tell
"
of
Mr.
Poulter
<EOS>
more
than
be
unavoidable
;
the
five
-
shill
piece
remain
a
secret
even
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
terrible
dread
weigh
on
his
mind
,
so
terrible
that
he
dare
not
even
ask
the
question
which
may
bring
the
fatal
"
yes
"
;
he
dare
not
ask
the
surgeon
or
Mr.
Stelling
,
"
Shall
I
be
lame
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
He
master
himself
so
as
not
to
cry
out
at
the
pain
;
but
when
his
foot
have
be
dress
,
and
he
be
leave
alone
with
Maggie
seat
by
his
bedside
,
the
child
sob
together
,
with
their
head
lay
on
the
same
pillow
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
think
of
himself
walk
about
on
crutch
,
like
the
wheelwright
's
son
;
and
Maggie
,
who
do
not
guess
what
be
in
his
mind
,
sob
for
company
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
occur
to
the
surgeon
or
to
Mr.
Stelling
to
anticipate
this
dread
in
Tom
's
mind
,
and
to
reassure
him
by
hopeful
word
.
<EOS>
but
Philip
watch
the
surgeon
out
of
the
house
,
and
waylay
Mr.
Stelling
to
ask
the
very
question
that
Tom
have
not
dare
to
ask
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
 
but
do
Mr.

say
Tulliver
will
be
lame

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no

oh

no

say
Mr.

,
"
not
permanently

only
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
tell
Tulliver
<EOS>
so
,
sir
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
nothing
be
say
to
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
may
I
go
and
tell
him
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to
be
sure
;
now
you
mention
it
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
he
may
be
trouble
about
that
.
<EOS>
go
to
his
bedroom
,
but
be
very
quiet
at
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
Philip
's
first
thought
when
he
hear
of
the
accident
,
 
"
Will
Tulliver
be
lame
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
hard
for
him
if
he
be
"
;
and
Tom
's
hitherto
unforgiven
offence
be
wash
out
by
that
pity
.
<EOS>
Philip
feel
that
they
be
no
longer
in
a
state
of
repulsion
,
but
be
be
draw
into
a
common
current
of
suffer
and
sad
privation
.
<EOS>
His
imagination
do
not
dwell
on
the
outward
calamity
and
its
future
effect
on
Tom
's
life
,
but
it
make
vividly
present
to
him
the
probable
state
of
Tom
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
only
live
fourteen
year
,
but
those
year
have
,
most
of
them
,
be
steep
in
the
sense
of
a
lot
irremediably
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Askern
say
you
will
soon
be
all
right
again
,
Tulliver
,
do
you
know
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
rather
timidly
,
as
he
step
gently
up
to
Tom
's
bed
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
be
to
ask
Mr.
Stelling
,
and
he
say
you
will
walk
as
well
as
ever
again
by
-
and

day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
look
up
with
that
momentary
stopping
of
the
breath
which
come
with
a
sudden
joy
;
then
he
give
a
long
sigh
,
and
turn
his
blue
-
gray
eye
straight
on
Philip
's
face
,
as
he
have
not
do
for
a
fortnight
or
more
.
<EOS>
as
for
Maggie
,
this
intimation
of
a
possibility
she
have
not
think
of
before
affect
her
as
a
new
trouble
;
the
bare
idea
of
Tom
's
be
always
lame
overpower
the
assurance
that
such
a
misfortune
be
not
likely
to
befall
him
,
and
she
cling
to
him
and
cry
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not

a
little
silly

Magsie

tenderly

Tulliver

Philip
,
put
out
his
small
,
delicate
hand
,
which
Tom
clasp
immediately
with
his
more
substantial
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
ask
Mr.
Stelling
to
let
you
come
and
sit
with
me
sometimes
,
till
I
get
up
again
,
Wakem
;
and
tell
me
about
Robert
Bruce
,
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
Philip
spend
all
his
time
out
of
school
-
hour
with
Tom
and
Maggie
.
<EOS>
Tom
like
to
hear
fight
story
as
much
as
ever
,
but
he
insist
strongly
on
the
fact
that
those
great
fighter
who
do
so
many
wonderful
thing
and
come
off
unhurt
,
wear
excellent
armor
from
head
to
foot
,
which
make
fight
easy
work
,
he
consider
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
have
hurt
his
foot
if
he
have
have
an
iron
shoe
on
.
<EOS>
He
listen
with
great
interest
to
a
new
story
of
Philip
's
about
a
man
who
have
a
very
bad
wound
in
his
foot
,
and
cry
out
so
dreadfully
with
the
pain
that
his
friend
could
bear
with
him
no
longer
,
but
put
him
ashore
on
a
desert
island
,
with
nothing
but
some
wonderful
poison
arrow
to
kill
animal
with
for
food
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
roar
out
a
bit
,
you
know
,
"
Tom
say
,
"
and
I
dare
say
my
foot
be
as
bad
as
his
.
<EOS>
It
be
cowardly
to
roar
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Maggie
would
have
it
that
when
anything
hurt
you
very
much
,
it
be
quite
permissible
to
cry
out
,
and
it
be
cruel
of
people
not
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
know
if
Philoctetes
have
a
sister
,
and
why
_
she
_
do
not
go
with
him
on
the
desert
island
and
take
care
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
soon
after
Philip
have
tell
this
story
,
he
and
Maggie
be
in
the
study
alone
together
while
Tom
's
foot
be
be
dress

<EOS>
Philip
be
at
his
book
,
and
Maggie
,
after
saunter
idly
round
the
room
,
not
care
to
do
anything
in
particular
,
because
she
would
soon
go
to
Tom
again
,
go
and
lean
on
the
table
near
Philip
to
see
what
he
be
do
,
for
they
be
quite
old
friend
now
,
and
perfectly
at
home
with
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you

about
in
Greek
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
poetry
,
I
can
see
that
,
because
the
line
be
so
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
about
philoctete

the
lame
man

he
answer
,
rest
his
head
on
his
hand
,
and
look
at
her
as
if
he
be
not
at
all
sorry
to
be
interrupt
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
in
her
absent
way
,
continue
to
lean
forward
,
rest
on
her
arm
and
move
her
foot
about
,
while
her
dark
eye
get
more
and
more
fixed
and
vacant
,
as
if
she
have
quite
forget
Philip
and
his
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
say
Philip
,
after
a
minute
or
two
,
still
lean
on
his
elbow
and
look
at
her
,
"
if
you
have
have
a
brother

do
you

<EOS>
Maggie
start
a
little
on
be
rouse
from
her
reverie
,
and
say
,
"
what

"
<EOS>
Philip
repeat
his
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
well
,
"
she
answer
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
no

not

because
I
do
not

you
better
than

I
should
be
so
sorry

so

<EOS>
Philip
color
;
he
have
mean
to
imply
,
would
she
love
him
as
well
in
spite
of
his
deformity
,
and
yet
when
she
allude
to
it
so
plainly
,
he
wince
under
her
pity
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
young
as
she
be
,
feel
her
mistake
.
<EOS>
hitherto
she
have
instinctively
behave
as
if
she
be
quite
unconscious
of
Philip
's
deformity
;
her
own
keen
sensitiveness
and
experience
under
family
criticism
suffice
to
teach
her
this
as
well
as
if
she
have
be
direct
by
the
most
finished
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
so
very
clever
,
Philip
,
and
you
can
play
and
sing

she
add
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you

<EOS>
my

<EOS>
I
be
very
fond

and
you
would
stay
at
home
with
me
when
Tom

out

you
would
teach
me
everything

would
not
you

Greek

everything

but
you
will
go
away
soon

and
go
to
school

Maggie

Philip
,
"
and
then
you
will
forget
all
about
me
,
and
not

any
more

and
then
I
shall

away
from
them
.
<EOS>
I
think
about
poor
Yap
;
he
be
get
a
lump
in
his
throat
,
and
Luke
say
he
will
die
.
<EOS>
only
do
not
you
tell
Tom
.
<EOS>
because
it
will
vex
him
so
.
<EOS>
You
never
see
Yap
;
he
be
a
queer
little
dog
,
 
nobody
care
about
him
but
Tom
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
care
as
much
about
me
as
you
do
about
Yap
,
Maggie
?
"
<EOS>
say
Philip
,
smile
rather
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
I
should
think
so
,
"
say
Maggie
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
fond
of
_
you
_
,
Maggie
;
I
shall
never
forget
_
you
_
,
"
say
Philip
,
"
and
when
I
be
very
unhappy
,
I
shall
always
think
of
you
,
and
wish
I
have
a
sister
with
dark
eye
,
just
like
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
like
my
eye
?
<EOS>
"
say
Maggie
,
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
hear
any
one
but
her
father
speak
of
her
eye
as
if
they
have
merit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
not
like
any
other
eye
.
<EOS>
They
seem
try
to
speak
,
 
try
to
speak
kindly
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
other
people
to
look
at
me
much
,
but
I
like
you
to
look
at
me
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
think
you
be
fonder
of
me
than
Tom
be
,
"
say
Maggie
,
rather
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
then
,
wonder
how
she
could
convince
Philip
that
she
could
like
him
just
as
well
,
although
he
be
crooked
,
she
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
Should
you
like
me
to
kiss
you
,
as
I
do
Tom
?
<EOS>
I
will
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
much
;
nobody
kiss
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
his
neck
and
kiss
him
quite
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
now
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
shall
always
remember
you
,
and
kiss
you
when
I
see
you
again
,
if
it
be
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
go
now
,
because
I
think
Mr.
Askern
's
do
with
Tom
's
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
their
father
come
the
second
time
,
Maggie
say
to
him
,
"
oh
,
father
,
Philip
Wakem
be
so
very
good
to
Tom
;
he
be
such
a
clever
boy
,
and
I
_
do
_
love
him
.
<EOS>
and
you
love
him
too
,
Tom
,
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Say
_
<EOS>
you
love
him
,
"
she
add
entreatingly
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
color
a
little
as
he
look
at
his
father
,
and
say
:
"
I
sha'n"t
be
friend
with
him
when
I
leave
school
,
father
;
but
we
have
make
it
up
now
,
since
my
foot
have
be
bad
,
and
he
be
teach
me
to
play
at
draught
,
and
I
can
beat
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Tulliver
,
"
if
he
be
good
to
you
,
try
and
make
him
amend
,
and
be
good
to
_
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
poor
crooked
creature
,
and
take
after
his
dead
mother
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
you
be
get
too
thick
with
him
;
he
be
get
his
father
's
blood
in
him
too
.
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
the
gray
colt
may
chance
to
kick
like
his
black
sire
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
jar
nature
of
the
two
boy
effect
what
Mr.
Tulliver
's
admonition
alone
may
have
fail
to
effect
;
in
spite
of
Philip
's
new
kindness
,
and
Tom
's
answer
regard
in
this
time
of
his
trouble
,
they
never
become
close
friend
.
<EOS>
when
Maggie
be
go
,
and
when
Tom
by
-
and
-
by
begin
to
walk
about
as
usual
,
the
friendly
warmth
that
have
be
kindle
by
pity
and
gratitude
die
out
by
degree
,
and
leave
them
in
their
old
relation
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
often
peevish
and
contemptuous
;
and
Tom
's
more
specific
and
kindly
impression
gradually
melt
into
the
old
background
of
suspicion
and
dislike
toward
him
as
a
queer
fellow
,
a
humpback
,
and
the
son
of
a
rogue
.
<EOS>
if
boy
and
man
be
to
be
weld
together
in
the
glow
of
transient
feeling
,
they
must
be
make
of
metal
that
will
mix
,
else
they
inevitably
fall
asunder
when
the
heat
die
out
.
    
<EOS>
the
Golden
Gates
be
pass
  
<EOS>
so
Tom
go
on
even
to
the
fifth
half
-
year
 
till
he
be
turn
sixteen
 
at
King
's
Lorton
,
while
Maggie
be
grow
with
a
rapidity
which
her
aunt
consider
highly
reprehensible
,
at
Miss
Firniss
's
boarding
-
school
in
the
ancient
town
of
Laceham
on
the
Floss
,
with
cousin
Lucy
for
her
companion
.
<EOS>
in
her
early
letter
to
Tom
she
have
always
send
her
love
to
Philip
,
and
ask
many
question
about
him
,
which
be
answer
by
brief
sentence
about
Tom
's
toothache
,
and
a
turf
-
house
which
he
be
help
to
build
in
the
garden
,
with
other
item
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
She
be
pain
to
hear
Tom
say
in
the
holiday
that
Philip
be
as
queer
as
ever
again
,
and
often
cross
.
<EOS>
They
be
no
longer
very
good
friend
,
she
perceive
;
and
when
she
remind
Tom
that
he
ought
always
to
love
Philip
for
be
so
good
to
him
when
his
foot
be
bad
,
he
answer
:
"
well
,
it
be
not
my
fault
;
_
I
_
do
not
do
anything
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
hardly
ever
see
Philip
during
the
remainder
of
their
school
-
life
;
in
the
Midsummer
holiday
he
be
always
away
at
the
seaside
,
and
at
Christmas
she
could
only
meet
him
at
long
interval
in
the
street
of
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
when
they
do
meet
,
she
remember
her
promise
to
kiss
him
,
but
,
as
a
young
lady
who
have
be
at
a
boarding
-
school
,
she
know
now
that
such
a
greeting
be
out
of
the
question
,
and
Philip
would
not
expect
it
.
<EOS>
the
promise
be
void
,
like
so
many
other
sweet
,
illusory
promise
of
our
childhood
;
void
as
promise
make
in
Eden
before
the
season
be
divide
,
and
when
the
starry
blossom
grow
side
by
side
with
the
ripen
peach
,
 
impossible
to
be
fulfil
when
the
golden
gate
have
be
pass
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
their
father
be
actually
engage
in
the
long
-
threaten
lawsuit
,
and
Wakem
,
as
the
agent
at
once
of
Pivart
and
Old
Harry
,
be
act
against
him
,
even
Maggie
feel
,
with
some
sadness
,
that
they
be
not
likely
ever
to
have
any
intimacy
with
Philip
again
;
the
very
name
of
Wakem
make
her
father
angry
,
and
she
have
once
hear
him
say
that
if
that
crook
-
back
son
live
to
inherit
his
father
's
ill
-
get
gain
,
there
would
be
a
curse
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
as
little
to
do
with
him
at
school
as
you
can
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
to
Tom
;
and
the
command
be
obey
the
more
easily
because
Mr.
Sterling
by
this
time
have
two
additional
pupil
;
for
though
this
gentleman
's
rise
in
the
world
be
not
of
that
meteor
-
like
rapidity
which
the
admirer
of
his
extemporaneous
eloquence
have
expect
for
a
preacher
whose
voice
demand
so
wide
a
sphere
,
he
have
yet
enough
of
grow
prosperity
to
enable
him
to
increase
his
expenditure
in
continue
disproportion
to
his
income
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Tom
's
school
course
,
it
go
on
with
mill
-
like
monotony
,
his
mind
continue
to
move
with
a
slow
,
half
-
stifle
pulse
in
a
medium
uninteresting
or
unintelligible
idea
.
<EOS>
but
each
vacation
he
bring
home
large
and
large
drawing
with
the
satiny
rendering
of
landscape
,
and
water
-
color
in
vivid
green
,
together
with
manuscript
book
full
of
exercise
and
problem
,
in
which
the
handwriting
be
all
the
fine
because
he
give
his
whole
mind
to
it
.
<EOS>
each
vacation
he
bring
home
a
new
book
or
two
,
indicate
his
progress
through
different
stage
of
history
,
christian
doctrine
,
and
latin
literature
;
and
that
passage
be
not
entirely
without
result
,
besides
the
possession
of
the
book
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
ear
and
tongue
have
become
accustomed
to
a
great
many
word
and
phrase
which
be
understand
to
be
sign
of
an
educate
condition
;
and
though
he
have
never
really
apply
his
mind
to
any
one
of
his
lesson
,
the
lesson
have
leave
a
deposit
of
vague
,
fragmentary
,
ineffectual
notion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
see
sign
of
acquirement
beyond
the
reach
of
his
own
criticism
,
think
it
be
probably
all
right
with
Tom
's
education
;
he
observe
,
indeed
,
that
there
be
no
map
,
and
not
enough
"
sum
"
;
but
he
make
no
formal
complaint
to
Mr.
Stelling
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
puzzling
business
,
this
schooling
;
and
if
he
take
Tom
away
,
where
could
he
send
him
with
well
effect
?
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
Tom
have
reach
his
last
quarter
at
King
's
Lorton
,
the
year
have
make
striking
change
in
him
since
the
day
we
see
him
return
from
Mr.
Jacobs
's
academy
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
youth
now
,
carry
himself
without
the
least
awkwardness
,
and
speak
without
more
shyness
than
be
a
become
symptom
of
blended
diffidence
and
pride
;
he
wear
his
tail
-
coat
and
his
stand
-
up
collar
,
and
watch
the
down
on
his
lip
with
eager
impatience
,
look
every
day
at
his
virgin
razor
,
with
which
he
have
provide
himself
in
the
last
holiday
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
already
leave
,
 
at
the
autumn
quarter
,
 
that
he
may
go
to
the
south
for
the
winter
,
for
the
sake
of
his
health
;
and
this
change
help
to
give
Tom
the
unsettled
,
exultant
feeling
that
usually
belong
to
the
last
month
before
leave
school
.
<EOS>
this
quarter
,
too
,
there
be
some
hope
of
his
father
's
lawsuit
be
decide
;
_
that
_
make
the
prospect
of
home
more
entirely
pleasurable
.
<EOS>
for
Tom
,
who
have
gather
his
view
of
the
case
from
his
father
's
conversation
,
have
no
doubt
that
Pivart
would
be
beat
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
have
not
hear
anything
from
home
for
some
week
,
 
a
fact
which
do
not
surprise
him
,
for
his
father
and
mother
be
not
apt
to
manifest
their
affection
in
unnecessary
letter
,
 
when
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
on
the
morning
of
a
dark
,
cold
day
near
the
end
of
November
,
he
be
tell
,
soon
after
enter
the
study
at
nine
o'clock
,
that
his
sister
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mrs.
stelle
who
have
come
into
the
study
to
tell
him
,
and
she
leave
him
to
enter
the
drawing
-
room
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
too
,
be
tall
now
,
with
braid
and
coiled
hair
;
she
be
almost
as
tall
as
Tom
,
though
she
be
only
thirteen
;
and
she
really
look
old
than
he
do
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
She
have
throw
off
her
bonnet
,
her
heavy
braid
be
push
back
from
her
forehead
,
as
if
it
would
not
bear
that
extra
load
,
and
her
young
face
have
a
strangely
worn
look
,
as
her
eye
turn
anxiously
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
when
Tom
enter
she
do
not
speak
,
but
only
go
up
to
him
,
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
kiss
him
earnestly
.
<EOS>
He
be
use
to
various
mood
of
her
,
and
feel
no
alarm
at
the
unusual
seriousness
of
her
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
how
be
it
<EOS>
you
be
come
so
early
this
cold
morning
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
do
you
come
in
the
gig
?
"
<EOS>
say
Tom
,
as
she
back
toward
the
sofa
,
and
draw
him
to
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
come
by
the
coach
.
<EOS>
I
have
walk
from
the
turnpike
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
how
be
it
<EOS>
you
be
not
at
school
?
<EOS>
the
holiday
have
not
begin
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
want
me
at
home
,
"
say
Maggie
,
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lip
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
home
three
or
four
day
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
not
my
father
well
?
"
say
Tom
,
rather
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
,
"
say
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
very
unhappy
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
the
lawsuit
be
end
,
and
I
come
to
tell
you
because
I
think
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
know
it
before
you
come
home
,
and
I
do
not
like
only
to
send
you
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
have
not
lose
?
"
say
Tom
,
hastily
,
spring
from
the
sofa
,
and
stand
before
Maggie
with
his
hand
suddenly
thrust
into
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
Tom
,
"
say
Maggie
,
look
up
at
him
with
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
be
silent
a
minute
or
two
,
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
:
  
"
My
father
will
have
to
pay
a
good
deal
of
money
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Maggie
,
rather
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
can
not
be
help
,
"
say
Tom
,
bravely
,
not
translate
the
loss
of
a
large
sum
of
money
into
any
tangible
result
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
my
father
be
very
much
vexed
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
look
at
Maggie
,
and
think
that
her
agitated
face
be
only
part
of
her
girlish
way
of
take
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Maggie
,
again
faintly
.
<EOS>
then
,
urge
to
full
speech
by
Tom
's
freedom
from
apprehension
,
she
say
loudly
and
rapidly
,
as
if
the
word
_
would
_
burst
from
her
:
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Tom
,
he
will
lose
the
mill
and
the
land
and
everything
;
he
will
have
nothing
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
eye
flash
out
one
look
of
surprise
at
her
,
before
he
turn
pale
,
and
tremble
visibly
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
,
but
sit
down
on
the
sofa
again
,
look
vaguely
out
of

<EOS>
anxiety
about
the
future
have
never
enter
Tom
's
mind
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
always
ride
a
good
horse
,
keep
a
good
house
,
and
have
the
cheerful
,
confident
air
of
a
man
who
have
plenty
of
property
to
fall
back
upon
.
<EOS>
Tom
have
never
dream
that
his
father
would
"
fail
"
;
_
that
_
be
a
form
of
misfortune
which
he
have
always
hear
speak
of
as
a
deep
disgrace
,
and
disgrace
be
an
idea
that
he
could
not
associate
with
any
of
his
relation
,
least
of
all
with
his
father
.
<EOS>
a
proud
sense
of
family
respectability
be
part
of
the
very
air
Tom
have
be
bear
and
bring
up
in
.
<EOS>
He
know
there
be
people
in
St.
Ogg
's
who
make
a
show
without
money
to
support
it
,
and
he
have
always
hear
such
people
speak
of
by
his
own
friend
with
contempt
and
reprobation
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
strong
belief
,
which
be
a
lifelong
habit
,
and
require
no
definite
evidence
to
rest
on
,
that
his
father
could
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
if
he
choose
;
and
since
his
education
at
Mr.
Stelling
's
have
give
him
a
more
expensive
view
of
life
,
he
have
often
think
that
when
he
get
old
he
would
make
a
figure
in
the
world
,
with
his
horse
and
dog
and
saddle
,
and
other
accoutrement
of
a
fine
young
man
,
and
show
himself
equal
to
any
of
his
contemporary
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
who
may
consider
themselves
a
grade
above
him
in
society
because
their
father
be
professional
man
,
or
have
large
oil
-
mill
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
prognostic
and
headshake
of
his
aunt
and
uncle
,
they
have
never
produce
the
least
effect
on
him
,
except
to
make
him
think
that
aunt
and
uncle
be
disagreeable
society
;
he
have
hear
them
find
fault
in
much
the
same
way
as
long
as
he
could
remember
.
<EOS>
His
father
know
better
than
they
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
down
have
come
on
Tom
's
lip
,
yet
his
thought
and
expectation
have
be
hitherto
only
the
reproduction
,
in
change
form
,
of
the
boyish
dream
in
which
he
have
live
three
year
ago
.
<EOS>
He
be
awaken
now
with
a
violent
shock
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
be
frightened
at
Tom
's
pale
,
tremble
silence
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
else
to
tell
him
,
 
something
bad
.
<EOS>
She
throw
her
arm
round
him
at
last
,
and
say
,
with
a
half
sob
:
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Tom
 
dear
,
dear
Tom
,
do
not
fret
too
much
;
try
and
bear
it
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
turn
his
cheek
passively
to
meet
her
entreat
kiss
,
and
there
gather
a
moisture
in
his
eye
,
which
he
just
rub
away
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
action
seem
to
rouse
him
,
for
he
shake
himself
and
say
:
"
I
shall
go
home
,
with
you
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
do
not
my
father
say
I
be
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no

Tom

father
do
not

say
Maggie
,
her
anxiety
about

his

feeling
help
her
to
master
her
agitation
.
<EOS>
what
_
would
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
he
do
when
she
tell
him
all
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
mother
want
you
to
come

poor
mother

<EOS>
she
cry
so
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Tom
,
it
be
very
dreadful
at
home

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
lip
grow
whiter
,
and
she
begin
to
tremble
almost
as
Tom
have
do
.
<EOS>
the
two
poor
thing
clung
closer
to
each
other
,
both
tremble
,
 
the
one
at
an
unshapen
fear
,
the
other
at
the
image
of
a
terrible
certainty
.
<EOS>
when
Maggie
speak
,
it
be
hardly
above
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
 
and
 
poor
father
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
could
not
utter
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
suspense
be
intolerable
to
Tom
.
<EOS>
a
vague
idea
of
go
to
prison
,
as
a
consequence
of
debt
,
be
the
shape
his
fear
have
begin
to
take
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
my
father
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
_
Tell
_
me
,
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
at
home
,
"
say
Maggie
,
find
it
easy
to
reply
to
that
question
.
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
she
add
,
after
a
pause
,
"
not
himself
 
<EOS>
he
fall
off
his
horse
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
nobody
but
me
ever
since
 
he
seem
to
have
lose
his
sense
.
<EOS>
O
father
,
father
   
"
  
with
these
last
word
,
Maggie
's
sobs
burst
forth
with
the
more
violence
for
the
previous
struggle
against
them
.
<EOS>
Tom
feel
that
pressure
of
the
heart
which
forbid
tear
;
he
have
no
distinct
vision
of
their
trouble
as
Maggie
have
,
who
have
be
at
home
;
he
only
feel
the
crush
weight
of
what
seem
unmitigated
misfortune
.
<EOS>
He
tighten
his
arm
almost
convulsively
round
Maggie
as
she
sob
,
but
his
face
look
rigid
and
tearless
,
his
eye
blank
,
 
as
if
a
black
curtain
of
cloud
have
suddenly
fall
on
his
path
.
  
<EOS>
but
Maggie
soon
check
herself
abruptly
;
a
single
thought
have
act
on
her
like
a
startling
sound
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
set
out
,
Tom
,
we
must
not
stay
.
<EOS>
Father
will
miss
me
;
we
must
be
at
the
turnpike
at
ten
to
meet
the
coach
.
"
<EOS>
She
say
this
with
hasty
decision
,
rub
her
eye
,
and
rise
to
seize
her
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
at
once
feel
the
same
impulse
,
and
rise
too
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
wait
a
minute
,
Maggie
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
speak
to
Mr.
Stelling
,
and
then
we
will
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
think
he
must
go
to
the
study
where
the
pupil
be
;
but
on
his
way
he
meet
Mr.
Stelling
,
who
have
hear
from
his
wife
that
Maggie
appear
to
be
in
trouble
when
she
ask
for
her
brother
,
and
now
that
he
think
the
brother
and
sister
have
be
alone
long
enough
,
be
come
to
inquire
and
offer
his
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
,
sir
,
I
must
go
home
,
"
<EOS>
Tom
say
abruptly
,
as
he
meet
Mr.
Stelling
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
back
with
my
sister
directly
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
lose
his
lawsuit
 
<EOS>
he
be
lose
all
his
property
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
feel
like
a
kind
-
hearted
man
;
he
foresee
a
probable
money
loss
for
himself
,
but
this
have
no
appreciable
share
in
his
feeling
,
while
he
look
with
grave
pity
at
the
brother
and
sister
for
whom
youth
and
sorrow
have
begin
together
.
<EOS>
when
he
know
how
Maggie
have
come
,
and
how
eager
she
be
to
get
home
again
,
he
hurry
their
departure
,
only
whisper
something
to
Mrs.
Stelling
,
who
have
follow
him
,
and
who
immediately
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
and
Maggie
be
stand
on
the
door
-
step
,
ready
to
set
out
,
when
Mrs.
Stelling
come
with
a
little
basket
,
which
she
hang
on
Maggie
's
arm
,
say
:
"
do
remember
to
eat
something
on
the
way
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
Maggie
's
heart
go
out
toward
this
woman
whom
she
have
never
like
,
and
she
kiss
her
silently
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
sign
within
the
poor
child
of
that
new
sense
which
be
the
gift
of
sorrow
,
 
that
susceptibility
to
the
bare
office
of
humanity
which
raise
them
into
a
bond
of
love
fellowship
,
as
to
haggard
man
among
the
ice
-
berg
the
mere
presence
of
an
ordinary
comrade
stir
the
deep
fountain
of
affection
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Stelling
put
his
hand
on
Tom
's
shoulder
and
say
:
"
God
bless
you
,
my
boy
;
let
me
know
how
you
get
on
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
press
Maggie
's
hand
;
but
there
be
no
audible
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Tom
have
so
often
think
how
joyful
he
should
be
the
day
he
leave
school
"
for
good
"
!
<EOS>
and
now
his
school
year
seem
like
a
holiday
that
have
come
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
slight
youthful
figure
soon
grow
indistinct
on
the
distant
road
,
 
be
soon
lose
behind
the
projecting
hedgerow
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
go
forth
together
into
their
life
of
sorrow
,
and
they
would
never
more
see
the
sunshine
undimmed
by
remembered
care
.
<EOS>
They
have
enter
the
thorny
wilderness
,
and
the
golden
gate
of
their
childhood
have
forever
close
behind
them
.
    
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
the
Downfall
_
  
<EOS>
what
have
happen
at
home
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Tulliver
first
know
the
fact
that
the
law
-
suit
be
decide
against
him
,
and
that
Pivart
and
Wakem
be
triumphant
,
every
one
who
happen
to
observe
him
at
the
time
think
that
,
for
so
confident
and
hot
-
temper
a
man
,
he
bear
the
blow
remarkably
well
.
<EOS>
He
think
so
himself
;
he
think
he
be
go
to
show
that
if
Wakem
or
anybody
else
consider
him
crush
,
they
would
find
themselves
mistaken
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
refuse
to
see
that
the
cost
of
this
protract
suit
would
take
more
than
he
possess
to
pay
them
;
but
he
appear
to
himself
to
be
full
of
expedient
by
which
he
could
ward
off
any
result
but
such
as
be
tolerable
,
and
could
avoid
the
appearance
of
break
down
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
all
the
obstinacy
and
defiance
of
his
nature
,
drive
out
of
their
old
channel
,
find
a
vent
for
themselves
in
the
immediate
formation
of
plan
by
which
he
would
meet
his
difficulty
,
and
remain
Mr.
Tulliver
of
Dorlcote
Mill
in
spite
of
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
rush
of
project
in
his
brain
,
that
it
be
no
wonder
his
face
be
flush
when
he
come
away
from
his
talk
with
his
attorney
,
Mr.
Gore
,
and
mount
his
horse
to
ride
home
from
Lindum
.
<EOS>
there
be
Furley
,
who
hold
the
mortgage
on
the
land
,
 
a
reasonable
fellow
,
who
would
see
his
own
interest
,
Mr.
Tulliver
be
convince
,
and
who
would
be
glad
not
only
to
purchase
the
whole
estate
,
include
the
mill
and
homestead
,
but
would
accept
Mr.
Tulliver
as
tenant
,
and
be
willing
to
advance
money
to
be
repay
with
high
interest
out
of
the
profit
of
the
business
,
which
would
be
make
over
to
him
,
Mr.
Tulliver
only
take
enough
barely
to
maintain
himself
and
his
family
.
<EOS>
who
would
neglect
such
a
profitable
investment
?
<EOS>
certainly
not
Furley
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
have
determine
that
Furley
should
meet
his
plan
with
the
utmost
alacrity
;
and
there
be
man
whose
brain
have
not
yet
be
dangerously
heat
by
the
loss
of
a
lawsuit
,
who
be
apt
to
see
in
their
own
interest
or
desire
a
motive
for
other
man
's
action
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
(
in
the
miller
's
mind
)
<EOS>
that
Furley
would
do
just
what
be
desirable
;
and
if
he
do
 
why
,
thing
would
not
be
so
very
much
bad
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
and
his
family
must
live
more
meagrely
and
humbly
,
but
it
would
only
be
till
the
profit
of
the
business
have
pay
off
Furley
's
advance
,
and
that
may
be
while
Mr.
Tulliver
have
still
a
good
many
year
of
life
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
cost
of
the
suit
could
be
pay
without
his
be
oblige
to
turn
out
of
his
old
place
,
and
look
like
a
ruin
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
an
awkward
moment
in
his
affair
.
<EOS>
there
be
that
suretyship
for
poor
Riley
,
who
have
die
suddenly
last
April
,
and
leave
his
friend
saddle
with
a
debt
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
,
 
a
fact
which
have
help
to
make
Mr.
Tulliver
's
banking
book
less
pleasant
reading
than
a
man
may
desire
toward
Christmas
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
he
have
never
be
one
of
those
poor
-
spirit
sneak
who
would
refuse
to
give
a
help
hand
to
a
fellow
-
traveller
in
this
puzzling
world
.
<EOS>
the
really
vexatious
business
be
the
fact
that
some
month
ago
the
creditor
who
have
lend
him
the
five
hundred
pound
to
repay
Mrs.
Glegg
have
become
uneasy
about
his
money
(
set
on
by
Wakem
,
of
course
)
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
,
still
confident
that
he
should
gain
his
suit
,
and
find
it
eminently
inconvenient
to
raise
the
say
sum
until
that
desirable
issue
have
take
place
,
have
rashly
accede
to
the
demand
that
he
should
give
a
bill
of
sale
on
his
household
furniture
and
some
other
effect
,
as
security
in
lieu
of
the
bond
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
one
,
he
have
say
to
himself
;
he
should
soon
pay
off
the
money
,
and
there
be
no
harm
in
give
that
security
any
more
than
another
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
consequence
of
this
bill
of
sale
occur
to
him
in
a
new
light
,
and
he
remember
that
the
time
be
close
at
hand
when
it
would
be
enforce
unless
the
money
be
repay
.
<EOS>
two
month
ago
he
would
have
declare
stoutly
that
he
would
never
be
behold
to
his
wife
's
friend
;
but
now
he
tell
himself
as
stoutly
that
it
be
nothing
but
right
and
natural
<EOS>
that
Bessy
should
go
to
the
Pullets
and
explain
the
thing
to
them
<EOS>
;
they
would
hardly
let
Bessy
's
furniture
be
sell
,
and
it
may
be
security
to
Pullet
if
he
advance
the
money
,
 
there
would
,
after
all
,
be
no
gift
or
favor
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
would
never
have
ask
for
anything
from
so
poor
-
spirit
a
fellow
for
himself
,
but
Bessy
may
do
so
if
she
like
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
precisely
the
proud
and
most
obstinate
man
who
be
the
most
liable
to
shift
their
position
and
contradict
themselves
in
this
sudden
manner
;
everything
be
easy
to
them
than
to
face
the
simple
fact
that
they
have
be
thoroughly
defeat
,
and
must
begin
life
anew
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Tulliver
,
you
perceive
,
though
nothing
more
than
a
superior
miller
and
maltster
,
be
as
proud
and
obstinate
as
if
he
have
be
a
very
lofty
personage
,
in
whom
such
disposition
may
be
a
source
of
that
conspicuous
,
far
-
echo
tragedy
,
which
sweep
the
stage
in
regal
robe
,
and
make
the
dull
chronicler

whom
you

every

it
be
of
that
unwept

hide
sort
that
go
on
from

such

young

hungry
for

under

under
the
dreariness

the

bring
no
promise
with
it

and
where
the
unexpectant
discontent
of
worn

disappointed
parent
weigh
on
the
child
like
a
damp

thick
air
,
in
which
all
the

<EOS>
there

tenacity

be
a
law
of

they
can
never

after

Mr.

<EOS>
but
what
be
it
that
suggest
to
him
,
as
he
see

office

and
get
the
clerk
there
to
write
a

require
Maggie

<EOS>
Mr.

's
own
hand
shake
too
much
under
his
excitement
for
him
to
write
himself

and
he
want
the
letter

give
to
the
coachman
to
deliver
at
Miss

Maggie

without

she
must
come

morrow

<EOS>
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
when
he
get
home

he
would
admit
no

and
scold
down
her
burst
of
grief
on
hear
that
the
lawsuit
be
lose
,
by
angry
assertion
that
there
be
nothing
to
grieve
about

<EOS>
He
say
nothing
to
her
that
night
about
the
bill
of
sale
and
the
application
to
Mrs.
Pullet

for
he
have
keep

the

and
,
among

with
the

<EOS>
the
next
day
Mr.

be
again
on
horseback
in
the
afternoon
,
on
his
way
to
Mr.
Gore

office
at
St.

.
<EOS>
Gore
be

have
see
Furley
in
the
morning
,
and
to
have
sound
him
in
relation
to
Mr.

's
affair
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
go
half
-
way
when
he
meet
a
clerk
from
Mr.
Gore
's
office
,
who
be
bring
a
letter
to
Mr.

.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gore
have
be
prevent
by
a
sudden
call
of
business
from
wait
at
his
office
to
see
Mr.
Tulliver
,
accord
to
appointment
,
but
would
be
at
his
office
at
eleven
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
meanwhile
have
send
some
important
information
by
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
Mr.
Tulliver
,
take
the
letter
,
but
not
open
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
tell
Gore
I
will
see
him
to
-
morrow
at
eleven
"
;
and
he
turn
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
the
clerk
,
strike
with
Mr.
Tulliver
's
glistening
,
excited
glance
,
look
after
him
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
ride
away
.
<EOS>
the
reading
of
a
letter
be
not
the
affair
of
an
instant
to
Mr.
Tulliver
;
he
take
in
the
sense
of
a
statement
very
slowly
through
the
medium
of
write
or
even
print
character
;
so
he
have
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
think
he
would
open
it
in
his
armchair
at
home
.
<EOS>
but
by
-
and
-
by
it
occur
to
him
that
there
may
be
something
in
the
letter
Mrs.
Tulliver
must
not
know
about
,
and
if
so
,
it
would
be
well
to
keep
it
out
of
her
sight
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
stop
his
horse
,
take
out
the
letter
,
and
read
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
short
letter
;
the
substance
be
,
that
Mr.
Gore
have
ascertain
,
on
secret
,
but
sure
authority
,
that
Furley
have
be
lately
much
straiten
for
money
,
and
have
part
with
his
security
,
 
among
the
rest
,
the
mortgage
on
Mr.
Tulliver
's
property
,
which
he
have
transfer
to
   
Wakem
.
  
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
after
this
Mr.
Tulliver
's
own
wagoner
find
him
lie
by
the
roadside
insensible
,
with
an
open
letter
near
him
,
and
his
gray
horse
snuff
uneasily
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
Maggie
reach
home
that
evening
,
in
obedience
to
her
father
's
call
,
he
be
no
longer
insensible
.
<EOS>
about
an
hour
before
he
have
become
conscious
,
and
after
vague
,
vacant
look
around
him
,
have
mutter
something
about
"
a
letter
,
"
which
he
presently
repeat
impatiently
.
<EOS>
at
the
instance
of
Mr.
Turnbull
,
the
medical
man
,
Gore
's
letter
be
bring
and
lay
on
the
bed
,
and
the
previous
impatience
seem
to
be
allay
.
<EOS>
the
stricken
man
lie
for
some
time
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
letter
,
as
if
he
be
try
to
knit
up
his
thought
by
its
help
.
<EOS>
but
presently
a
new
wave
of
memory
seem
to
have
come
and
sweep
the
other
away
;
he
turn
his
eye
from
the
letter
to
the
door
,
and
after
look
uneasily
,
as
if
strive
to
see
something
his
eye
be
too
dim
for
,
he
say
,
"
the
little
wench
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
repeat
the
word
impatiently
from
time
to
time
,
appear
entirely
unconscious
of
everything
except
this
one
importunate
want
,
and
give
no
sign
of
know
his
wife
or
any
one
else
;
and
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
her
feeble
faculty
almost
paralyze
by
this
sudden
accumulation
of
trouble
,
go
backward
and
forward
to
the
gate
to
see
if
the
laceham
coach
be
come
,
though
it
be
not
yet
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
come
at
last
,
and
set
down
the
poor
anxious
girl
,
no
longer
the
"
little
wench
,
"
except
to
her
father
's
fond
memory
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
mother
,
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
Maggie
say
,
with
pale
lip
,
as
her
mother
come
toward
her
crying
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
her
father
be
ill
,
because
the
letter
have
come
at
his
dictation
from
the
office
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Turnbull
come
now
to
meet
her
;
a
medical
man
be
the
good
angel
of
the
troubled
house
,
and
Maggie
run
toward
the
kind
old
friend
,
whom
she
remember
as
long
as
she
could
remember
anything
,
with
a
tremble
,
question
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
alarm
yourself
too
much
,
my
dear
,
"
he
say
,
take
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Your
father
have
have
a
sudden
attack
,
and
have
not
quite
recover
his
memory
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
be
ask
for
you
,
and
it
will
do
him
good
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
keep
as
quiet
as
you
can
;
take
off
your
thing
,
and
come
upstairs
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
obey
,
with
that
terrible
beating
of
the
heart
which
make
existence
seem
simply
a
painful
pulsation
.
<EOS>
the
very
quietness
with
which
Mr.
Turnbull
speak
have
frighten
her
susceptible
imagination
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
eye
be
still
turn
uneasily
toward
the
door
when
she
enter
and
meet
the
strange
,
yearning
,
helpless
look
that
have
be
seek
her
in
vain
.
<EOS>
with
a
sudden
flash
and
movement
,
he
raise
himself
in
the
bed
;
she
rush
toward
him
,
and
clasp
him
with
agonized
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
poor
child
!
<EOS>
it
be
very
early
for
her
to
know
one
of
those
supreme
moment
in
life
when
all
we
have
hope
or
delight
in
,
all
we
can
dread
or
endure
,
fall
away
from
our
regard
as
insignificant
;
be
lose
,
like
a
trivial
memory
,
in
that
simple
,
primitive
love
which
knit
us
to
the
being
who
have
be
near
to
us
,
in
their
time
of
helplessness
or
of
anguish
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
flash
of
recognition
have
be
too
great
a
strain
on
the
father
's
bruise
,
enfeeble
power
.
<EOS>
He
sink
back
again
in
renew
insensibility
and
rigidity
,
which
last
for
many
hour
,
and
be
only
break
by
a
flickering
return
of
consciousness
,
in
which
he
take
passively
everything
that
be
give
to
him
,
and
seem
to
have
a
sort
of
infantine
satisfaction
in
Maggie
's
near
presence
,
 
such
satisfaction
as
a
baby
have
when
it
be
return
to
the
nurse
's
lap
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
send
for
her
sister
,
and
there
be
much
wail
and
lift
up
of
hand
below
stair
.
<EOS>
both
uncle
and
aunt
see
that
the
ruin
of
Bessy
and
her
family
be
as
complete
as
they
have
ever
forebode
it
,
and
there
be
a
general
family
sense
that
a
judgment
have
fall
on
Mr.
Tulliver
,
which
it
would
be
an
impiety
to
counteract
by
too
much
kindness
.
<EOS>
but
Maggie
hear
little
of
this
,
scarcely
ever
leave
her
father
's
bedside
,
where
she
sit
opposite
him
with
her
hand
on
his
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
want
to
have
Tom
fetch
home
,
and
seem
to
be
think
more
of
her
boy
even
than
of
her
husband
;
but
the
aunt
and
uncle
oppose
this
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
well
at
school
,
since
Mr.
Turnbull
say
there
be
no
immediate
danger
,
he
believe
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
,
when
Maggie
have
become
more
accustomed
to
her
father
's
fit
of
insensibility
,
and
to
the
expectation
that
he
would
revive
from
them
,
the
thought
of
Tom
have
become
urgent
with
_
<EOS>
her
_
too
;
and
when
her
mother
sate
cry
at
night
and
say
,
"
My
poor
lad
 
<EOS>
it
be
nothing
<EOS>
but
right
he
should
come
home
<EOS>
,
"
Maggie
say
,
"
let
me
go
for
him
,
and
tell
him
,
mother
;
I
will
go
to
-
morrow
morning
if
father
do
not
know
me
and
want
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
so
hard
for
Tom
to
come
home
and
not
know
anything
about
it
beforehand
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
next
morning
Maggie
go
,
as
we
have
see
.
<EOS>
sit
on
the
coach
on
their
way
home
,
the
brother
and
sister
talk
to
each
other
in
sad
,
interrupted
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
Mr.
Wakem
have
get
a
mortgage
or
something
on
the
land
,
Tom
,
"
say
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
letter
with
that
news
in
it
that
make
father
ill
,
they
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
scoundrel
be
be
plan
all
along
to
ruin
my
father
,
"
say
Tom
,
leap
from
the
vague
impression
to
a
definite
conclusion
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
him
feel
for
it
when
I
be
a
man
.
<EOS>
mind
<EOS>
you
never
speak
to
Philip
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Tom
!
"
say
Maggie
,
in
a
tone
of
sad
remonstrance
;
but
she
have
no
spirit
to
dispute
anything
then
,
still
less
to
vex
Tom
by
oppose
him
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
Teraphim
,
or
household
Gods
  
<EOS>
when
the
coach
set
down
Tom
and
Maggie
,
it
be
five
hour
since
she
have
start
from
home
,
and
she
be
think
with
some
tremble
that
her
father
have
perhaps
miss
her
,
and
ask
for
"
the
little
wench
"
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
no
other
change
that
may
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
She
hurry
along
the
gravel
-
walk
and
enter
the
house
before
Tom
;
but
in
the
entrance
she
be
startle
by
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
the
parlor
door
be
ajar
;
that
be
where
the
smell
come
from
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
strange
;
could
any
visitor
be
smoke
at
a
time
like
this
?
<EOS>
be
her
mother
there
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
she
must
be
tell
that
Tom
be
come
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
after
this
pause
of
surprise
,
be
only
in
the
act
of
open
the
door
when
Tom
come
up
,
and
they
both
look
into
the
parlor
together
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
coarse
,
dingy
man
,
of
whose
face
<EOS>
Tom
have
some
vague
recollection
,
sit
in
his
father
's
chair
,
smoking
,
with
a
jug
and
glass
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
flash
on
Tom
's
mind
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
to
"
have
the
bailiff
in
the
house
,
"
and
"
to
be
sell
up
,
"
be
phrase
which
he
have
be
use
to
,
even
as
a
little
boy
;
they
be
part
of
the
disgrace
and
misery
of
"
fail
,
"
of
lose
all
one
's
money
,
and
be
ruin
,
 
sink
into
the
condition
of
poor
working
people
.
<EOS>
It
seem
only
natural
this
should
happen
,
since
his
father
have
lose
all
his
property
,
and
he
think
of
no
more
special
cause
for
this
particular
form
of
misfortune
than
the
loss
of
the
lawsuit
.
<EOS>
but
the
immediate
presence
of
this
disgrace
be
so
much
keen
an
experience
to
Tom
than
the
bad
form
of
apprehension
,
that
he
feel
at
this
moment
as
if
his
real
trouble
have
only
just
begin
;
it
be
a
touch
on
the
irritated
nerve
compare
with
its
spontaneous
dull
aching
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
sir
?
"
say
the
man
,
take
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
with
rough
,
embarrassed
civility
.
<EOS>
the
two
young
startle
face
make
him
a
little
uncomfortable
.
  
<EOS>
but
Tom
turn
away
hastily
without
speak
;
the
sight
be
too
hateful
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
not
understand
the
appearance
of
this
stranger
,
as
Tom
have
.
<EOS>
She
follow
him
,
whisper
:
"
who
can
it
be
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
then
,
with
a

go

she
cling
to
him

<EOS>
for
the

Tom
think
of
his

with
some
reproach

<EOS>
His
natural
inclination
to
blame
,
hitherto
keep
entirely
in
abeyance
toward
his
father
by
the
predisposition
to
think
him
always
right

simply
on

ground
that
he

Tom
Tulliver

father

be
turn
into

with
his
indignation
against
Wakem
there
begin
to
mingle
some
indignation
of
another
sort

<EOS>
perhaps
his
father
may
have
help
bring
them
all
down
in
the
world
,
and
make
people
talk
of
them
with
contempt

no
one
should
talk
long
of
Tom
Tulliver
with
contempt

<EOS>
the
natural
strength

firmness
of
his
nature
be
begin
to
assert
itself
,
urge
by
the
double
stimulus
of
resentment
against
his

the
sense
that
he
must
behave
like
a
man

take
care
of
his

look

sadly

Maggie

with
gather
anger

reproach
against

neutralize
all
her
pity
for
griefs
about
tablecloth
and
china
;
and
her
anger
on
her
father
's
account
be
heighten
by
some
egoistic
resentment
at
Tom
's
silent
concurrence
with
her
mother
in
shut
her
out
from
the
common
calamity
.
<EOS>
She
have
become
almost
indifferent
to
her
mother
's
habitual
depreciation
of
her

but
she
be
keenly
alive
to
any
sanction
of
it

however
passive

she
may
suspect
in
Tom

<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
be
by

put
forth
large
claim

herself

<EOS>
She
burst
out
at
last
in
an
agitated

almost
violent
tone
:
"

how
can
you

so

you
ought

so
too

<EOS>
Maggie

almost
choke
with
mingled
grief
and
anger
,
leave
the
room
,

take
her
old
place
on

father

<EOS>
Her
heart
go
out
to
him
with
a
strong
movement

ever

at
the
thought

people
would
blame
him

<EOS>
Maggie
hate
blame

she
have
be
blame
all
her
life

nothing
have
come
of
it

evil
temper

<EOS>
Her

have
always
defend

excuse
her

of
his

her

do

bear
anything
for
his

<EOS>
Tom
be
a
little
shocked
at
Maggie

tell
_
him

as
well
as
his

what
it
be
right

do

She
ought
to
have
learn
better
than
have

but
he
presently
go
into
his

and
the
sight
there
touch
him
in
a
way
that
efface
the
slighter
impression

<EOS>
when

move

she
go

put

sadly

Mr.

the

superfluous

the
sight
of

door
suggest
a
new
thought
to

She

the

have

turn
over
in
his

a
plan

to
propose
to

<EOS>
,
he
feel
by
no

amicably
toward

dread

endurable
in

<EOS>
as
for

peculiarly
depress
this
morning
;
she
have
be
call
up
,
after
brief
rest
,
at
three
o'clock
,
and
have
that
strange
dreamy
weariness
which
come
from
watch
in
a
sick
-
room
through
the
chill
hour
of
early
twilight
and
break
day
,
 
in
which
the
outside
day

light
life
seem
to
have
no
importance
,
and
to
be
a
mere
margin
to
the
hour
in
the
darken
chamber
.
<EOS>
Their
entrance
interrupt
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
the
shaking
of
hand
be
a
melancholy
and
silent
ceremony
,
till
uncle
Pullet
observe
,
as
Tom
approach
him
:
  
"
well

young

we

we

<EOS>
now

the

<EOS>

to

the

o

<EOS>
let

see
whether
you
can
do
better
than
I
can

make

I
begin

do
with

,
you

I
could
live
on

basin
o

porridge

bread

cheese

<EOS>

I

it
harder

he
must
do
it
,
"
interpose

energetically

whether

hard

<EOS>
He
have
not

he
must
consider
as
he
be
not

trusten
to
his

keep
him
in
idleness

luxury
;
he
be
get
to
bear
the
fruit
of
his
father

misconduct
,
and
bring
his
mind
to
fare
hard
and
to
work
hard

<EOS>
and
he
must
be
humble

grateful
to
his

what

You

<EOS>
"
yes

I

Tom

decidedly

<EOS>
"
I
know
if
I
owe
money
to
one
man

I
have
no
right
to
give
it
to
another

but
if
my
father
have
make
up
his
mind
to
give
my
aunt
the
money
before
he
be
in
debt
,
he
have
a
right
to
do
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

I

not
think
you

so
sharp

say
uncle
Glegg
,
with
much
candor
.
<EOS>

perhaps
your
father

do
_
make
away
with
the
note

go

can
find

between
the
fit
of
spasmodic
rigidity
which
have
recur
at
interval
ever
since
he
have
be
find
fall
from
his
horse
,
be
usually
in
so
apathetic
a
condition
that
the
exit
and
entrance
into
his
room
be
not
feel
to
be
of
great
importance
.
<EOS>
He
have
lain
so
still
,
with
his
eye
close
,
all
this
morning
,
that
Maggie
tell
her
aunt
Moss
<EOS>
she
must
not
expect
her
father
to
take
any
notice

<EOS>
They
enter
very
quietly
,
and
Mrs.
Moss
take
her
seat
near
the
head
of
the
bed
,
while
Maggie
sit
in
her
old
place
on
the
bed
,
and
put
her
hand
on
her
father
's
without
cause
any
change
in
his
face

<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
and
Tom
have
also
enter
,
tread
softly
,
and
be
busy
select
the
key
of
the
old
oak
chest
from
the
bunch
which
Tom
have
bring
from
his
father
's
bureau
.
<EOS>
They
succeed
in
open
the
chest
,
 
which
stand
opposite
the
foot
of
Mr.

's
bed
,
 
and
prop
the
lid
with

without

noise

<EOS>
"
there

tin
box

Mr.

he
would
most
like
put

lift
it
out

I
will
just
lift
up
these

when
the
iron
holder
give
way
,
and
the
heavy
lid
fall
with
a
loud
bang
that
resound
over
the
house

<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
something
in
that
sound
more
than
the
mere
fact
of
the
strong
vibration
that
produce
the
instantaneous
effect
on

frame
of
the
prostrate
man

and
for
the
time
completely
shake
off
the

the

in

tremble

it

but
instead
of

anything
more
to
him
,
his

continue
to
look
with
a
grow
distinctness
of
suspicion
at

add
impatiently

to
the
foot

Mr.

<EOS>
Mr.

fix
his
eye
on
the

and
remain
silent
for
two
or
three
minute
.
<EOS>
a
new
shadow
come
over
his
face

<EOS>
He
look
up
at
Maggie
first

and
say
in

low
tone

<EOS>
"

he

,
so
preoccupied
that
he
receive
the
kiss

Uncle

firmly
:

at

get

<EOS>
it
be
a
poor
tale
   
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
sanative
effect
of
the
strong
vibration
be
exhaust
,
and
with
the
last
word
the
poor
man
fall
again
,
rigid
and
insensible
.
<EOS>
though
this
be
only
a
recurrence
of
what
have
happen
before
,
it
strike
all
present
as
if
it
have
be
death
,
not
only
from
its
contrast
with
the
completeness
of
the
revival
,
but
because
his
word
have
all
have
reference
to
the
possibility
that
his
death
be
near
.
<EOS>
but
with
poor
Tulliver
death
be
not
to
be
a
leap
;
it
be
to
be
a
long
descent
under
thicken
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
be
send
for
;
but
when
he
hear
what
have
pass
,
he
say
this
complete
restoration
,
though
only
temporary
,
be
a
hopeful
sign
,
prove
that
there
be
no
permanent
lesion
to
prevent
ultimate
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
thread
of
the
past
which
the
stricken
man
have
gather
up
,
he
have
omit
the
bill
of
sale
;
the
flash
of
memory
have
only
light
up
prominent
idea
,
and
he
sink
into
forgetfulness
again
with
half
his
humiliation
unlearn
.
  
<EOS>
but
Tom
be
clear
upon
two
point
,
 
that
his
uncle
Moss
's
note
must
be
destroy
;
and
that
Luke
's
money
must
be
pay
,
if
in
no
other
way
,
out
of
his
own
and
Maggie
's
money
now
in
the
saving
bank
.
<EOS>
there
be
subject
,
you
perceive
,
on
which
Tom
be
much
quick
than
on
the
nicety
of
classical
construction
,
or
the
relation
of
a
mathematical
demonstration
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
apply
His
Knife
to
the
Oyster
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
Tom
be
on
his
way
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
to
see
his
uncle
Deane
,
who
be
to
come
home
last
night
,
his
aunt
have
say
;
and
Tom
have
make
up
his
mind
that
his
uncle
Deane
be
the
right
person
to
ask
for
advice
about
get
some
employment
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
great
way
of
business
;
he
have
not
the
narrow
notion
of
uncle
Glegg
;
and
he
have
rise
in
the
world
on
a
scale
of
advancement
which
accord
with
Tom
's
ambition
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
dark
,
chill
,
misty
morning
,
likely
to
end
in
rain
,
 
one
of
those
morning
when
even
happy
people
take
refuge
in
their
hope
.
<EOS>
and
Tom
be
very
unhappy
;
he
feel
the
humiliation
as
well
as
the
prospective
hardship
of
his
lot
with
all
the
keenness
of
a
proud
nature
;
and
with
all
his
resolute
dutifulness
toward
his
father
there
mingle
an
irrepressible
indignation
against
him
which
give
misfortune
the
less
endurable
aspect
of
a
wrong
.
<EOS>
since
these
be
the
consequence
of
go
to
law
,
his
father
be
really
blamable
,
as
his
aunt
and
uncle
have
always
say
he
be
;
and
it
be
a
significant
indication
of
Tom
's
character
,
that
though
he
think
his
aunt
ought
to
do
something
more
for
his
mother
,
he
feel
nothing
like
Maggie
's
violent
resentment
against
them
for
show
no
eager
tenderness
and
generosity
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
impulse
in
Tom
that
lead
him
to
expect
what
do
not
present
itself
to
him
as
a
right
to
be
demand
.
<EOS>
why
should
people
give
away
their
money
plentifully
to
those
who
have
not
take
care
of
their
own
money
?
<EOS>
Tom
see
some
justice
in
severity
;
and
all
the
more
,
because
he
have
confidence
in
himself
that
he
should
never
deserve
that
just
severity
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
upon
him
that
he
should
be
put
at
this
disadvantage
in
life
by
his
father
's
want
of
prudence
;
but
he
be
not
go
to
complain
and
to
find
fault
with
people
because
they
do
not
make
everything
easy
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
ask
no
one
to
help
him
,
more
than
to
give
him
work
and
pay
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
poor
Tom
be
not
without
his
hope
to
take
refuge
in
under
the
chill
damp
imprisonment
of
the
December
fog
,
which
seem
only
like
a
part
of
his
home
trouble

<EOS>
at
sixteen
,
the
mind
that
have
the
strong
affinity
for
fact
can
not
escape
illusion
and
self
-
flattery
;
and
Tom
,
in
sketch
his
future
,
have
no
other
guide
in
arrange
his
fact
than
the
suggestion
of
his
own
brave
self
-
reliance
.
<EOS>
both
Mr.
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
,
he
know
,
have
be
very
poor
once
;
he
do
not
want
to
save
money
slowly
and
retire
on
a
moderate
fortune
like
his
uncle
Glegg
,
but
he
would
be
like
his
uncle
Deane
 
get
a
situation
in
some
great
house
of
business
and
rise
fast
.
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
see
anything
of
his
uncle
Deane
for
the
last
three
year
 
the
two
family
have
be
get
wide
apart
;
but
for
this
very
reason
Tom
be
the
more
hopeful
about
apply
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
uncle
Glegg
<EOS>
,
he
feel
sure
,
would
never
encourage
any
spirited
project
,
but
he
have
a
vague
impose
idea
of
the
resource
at
his
uncle
Deane
's
command
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
his
father
say
,
long
ago
,
how
Deane
have
make
himself
so
valuable
to
Guest
&
Co.
that
they
be
glad
enough
to
offer
him
a
share
in
the
business
;
that
be
what
Tom
resolve
_
he
_
would
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
intolerable
to
think
of
be
poor
and
look
down
upon
all
one
's
life
.
<EOS>
He
would
provide
for
his
mother
and
sister
,
and
make
every
one
say
that
he
be
a
man
of
high
character
.
<EOS>
He
leap
over
the
year
in
this
way
,
and
,
in
the
haste
of
strong
purpose
and
strong
desire
,
do
not
see
how
they
would
be
make
up
of
slow
day
,
hour
,
and
minute
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
he
have
cross
the
stone
bridge
over
the
Floss
and
be
enter
St.
Ogg
's
,
he
be
think
that
he
would
buy
his
father
's
mill
and
land
again
when
he
be
rich
enough
,
and
improve
the
house
and
live
there
;
he
should
prefer
it
to
any
smart
,
new
place
,
and
he
could
keep
as
many
horse
and
dog
as
he
like
.
  
<EOS>
walk
along
the
street
with
a
firm
,
rapid
step
,
at
this
point
in
his
reverie
he
be
startle
by
some
one
who
have
cross
without
his
notice
,
and
who
say
to
him
in
a
rough
,
familiar
voice
:
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Master
Tom
,
how
be
your
father
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
publican
of
St.
Ogg

one
of
his
father
's
customer

<EOS>
Tom
dislike
be

to
just
then
;
but
he
say
civilly
,
"
He
be
still
very
ill

thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
it
be
be
a
sore
chance

young
man

against
him

"
say
the
publican
,
with
a
confused
,
beery
idea
of
be
good
-
natured
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
redden
and
pass
on
;
he
would
have
feel
it
like
the
handling
of
a
bruise
,
even
if
there
have
be
the
most
polite
and
delicate
reference
to
his
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
Tulliver

the
publican
to
a
grocer

on
the
adjacent

<EOS>
"
ah

the
grocer
,

He

"
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
rouse
from
his
dream
of
the
future
to
a
thorough
consciousness
of
the
present
,
make
all
the
great
haste
to
reach
the
warehouse
office
of
Guest

Co.
,
where
he
expect
to
find
his

<EOS>
but
this
be
Mr.
Deane
's
morning
at
the
band
,
a
clerk
tell
him
,
and
with
some
contempt
for
his
ignorance
;
Mr.

be
not

in
River

on
a
Thursday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
at

where
his

immediately
after

<EOS>
Mr.

be
auditing
account
;
but
he
look
up
as
Tom

,
and
put
out
his
hand
,
say
,
"
well
,
Tom
,

"
  
"
much
the

,
thank
you

"
say
Tom
,
feel
nervous
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
want
to
speak
to
you

please
,
when
you
be
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
sit
down
,
sit
down
,
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
relapse
into
his
account
,
in
which
he
and
the
managing

clerk
remain
so
absorb
for
the
next
half
-
hour
that
Tom
begin
to
wonder
whether
he
should
have
to
sit
in
this
way
till
the
bank
close
,
 
there
seem
so
little
tendency
toward
a
conclusion
in
the
quiet
,
monotonous
procedure
of
these
sleek
,
prosperous
man
of
business
.
<EOS>
Would
his
uncle
give
him
a
place
in
the
bank
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
dull
,
prosy
work
,
he
think
,
write
there
forever
to
the
loud
ticking
of
a
timepiece
.
<EOS>
He
prefer
some
other
way
of
get
rich
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
there
be
a
change
;
his
uncle
take
a
pen
and
write
something
with
a
flourish
at
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
just
step
up
to
Torry
's
now
,
Mr.
Spence
,
will
you
?
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
and
the
clock
suddenly
become
less
loud
and
deliberate
in
Tom
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Tom
,
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
when
they
be
alone
,
turn
his
substantial
person
a
little
in
his
chair
,
and
take
out
his
snuff

box
;
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
business
,
my
boy
;
what

the
business

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
,
who
have
hear
from
his

what
have
pass
the
day
before
,
think
Tom
be
come
to
appeal
to
him
for
some
mean
of

<EOS>
"
I

you
will
excuse
me
for
trouble

Tom

coloring
,
but
speak
in
a
tone
which
,
though
,
tremulous
,
have
a
certain
proud
independence
in
it
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
be
the
good
person
to
advise
me
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
reserve
his
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
look
at
Tom
with
new
attention
,
"
let
us
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
get
a
situation

I
may
earn
some
money

Tom
,
who
never
fall
into
circumlocution

<EOS>
"
a
situation

Mr.

,
and
then
take
his
pinch

snuff
with
elaborate
justice
to
each
nostril

<EOS>
Tom
think
snuff

take
a
most
provoking
habit

<EOS>
"
why
,
let
me
see
,
how
old
be
you
?
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
as
he
throw
himself
backward
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
sixteen
;
I
mean
,
I
be
go
in
seventeen

"
say
Tom
,
hope
his
uncle
notice
how
much
beard
he
have
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
;
your
father
have
some
notion
of
make
you
an
engineer
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not

I
could
get
any
money
at
that
for
a
long
while

could
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
;
but
people
do
not
get
much
money
at
anything
,
my
boy
,
when
they
be
only
sixteen
.
<EOS>
You
have
have
a
good
deal
of
schooling
,
however
;
I
suppose
you
be
pretty
well
up
in
account
,
eh
?
<EOS>
You
understand
book
keep
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Tom
,
rather
falteringly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
Practice
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Stelling
say
I
write
a
good
hand
,
uncle

<EOS>
that
be
my
writing

"
add
Tom
,
lay
on
the
table
a
copy
of
the
list
he
have
make
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
good
<EOS>
,
that
be
good
.
<EOS>
but
,
you
see
,
the
good
hand
in
the
world'll
not
get
you
a
well
place
than
a
copying
-
clerk
's
,
if
you
know
nothing
of
book
-
keeping
,
 
nothing
of
account
.
<EOS>
and
a
copying
-
clerk
be
a
cheap
article
.
<EOS>
but
what
have
you
be
learn
at
school
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
have
not
occupy
himself
with
method
of
education
,
and
have
no
precise
conception
of
what
go
forward
in
expensive
school
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
learn
Latin
,
"
say
Tom
,
pause
a
little
between
each
item
,
as
if
he
be
turn
over
the
book
in
his
school
-
desk
to
assist
his
memory
,
 
"
a
good
deal
of
Latin
;
and
the
last
year
I
do
Themes
,
one
week
in
Latin
and
one
in
English
;
and
greek
and
roman
history
;
and
Euclid
;
and
I
begin
Algebra
,
but
I
leave
it
off
again
;
and
we
have
one
day
every
week
for
Arithmetic
.
<EOS>
then
I
use
to
have
drawing
-
lesson
;
and
there
be
several
other
book
we
either
read
or
learn
out
of
,
 
English
Poetry
,
and
Horæ
Pauliné
and
Blair
's
Rhetoric
,
the
last
half
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
tap
his
snuff
-
box
again
and
screw
up
his
mouth
;
he
feel
in
the
position
of
many
estimable
person
when
they
have
read
the
New
Tariff
,
and
find
how
many
commodity
be
import
of
which
they
know
nothing
;
like
a
cautious
man
of
business
,
he
be
not
go
to
speak
rashly
of
a
raw
material
in
which
he
have
have
no
experience
.
<EOS>
but
the
presumption
be
,
that
if
it
have
be
good
for
anything
,
so
successful
a
man
as
himself
would
hardly
have
be
ignorant
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
about
Latin
he
have
an
opinion
,
and
think
that
in
case
of
another
war
,
since
people
would
no
longer
wear
hair
-
powder
,
it
would
be
well
to
put
a
tax
upon
Latin
,
as
a
luxury
much
run
upon
by
the
high
class
,
and
not
tell
at
all
on
the
ship
-
own
department
.
<EOS>
but
,
for
what
he
know
,
the
Horé
Pauliné
may
be
something
less
neutral
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
this
list
of
acquirement
give
him
a
sort
of
repulsion
toward
poor
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
say
at
last
,
in
rather
a
cold
,
sardonic
tone
,
"
you
have
have
three
year
at
these
thing
,
 
you
must
be
pretty
strong
in
'em
.
<EOS>
have
not
you
better
take
up
some
line
where
they
will
come
in
handy
?
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
color
,
and
burst
out
,
with
new
energy
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
have
any
employment
of
that
sort
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
Latin
and
those
thing
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
could
do
with
them
unless
I
go
as
usher
in
a
school
;
and
I
do
not
know
them
well
enough
for
that
!
<EOS>
besides
,
I
would
as
soon
carry
a
pair
of
pannier
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
be
that
sort
of
person
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
enter
into
some
business
where
I
can
get
on
,
 
a
manly
business
,
where
I
should
have
to
look
after
thing
,
and
get
credit
for
what
I
do

and
I
shall
want
to
keep
my
mother

sister

<EOS>
"
ah
,
young
gentleman
,
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
with
that
tendency
to
repress
youthful
hope
which
stout
and
successful
man
of
fifty
find
one
of
their
easy
duty
,
"
that
be
sooner
say
than
do

,
 
sooner
say
than
do

<EOS>
"
but
do
not
_
<EOS>
you
_
get
on
in
that
way

uncle
?
"
<EOS>
say
Tom
,
a
little
irritated
that
Mr.
Deane
do
not
enter
more
rapidly
into
his
view
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
do
not
you
rise
from
one
place
to
another
through
your
ability
and
good
conduct
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
spread
himself
in
his
chair
a
little
,
and
enter
with
great
readiness
into
a
retrospect
of
his
own
career
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
tell
you
how
I
get
on
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
by
get
astride
a
stick
and
think
it
would
turn
into
a
horse
if
I
sit
on
it
long
enough
.
<EOS>
I
keep
my
eye
and
ear
open
,
sir
,
and
I
be
not
too
fond
of
my
own
back
,
and
I
make
my
master
's
interest
my
own
.
<EOS>
why
,
with
only
look
into
what
go
on
in
the
mill
,
,
I
find
out
how
there
be
a
waste
of
five
hundred
a
-
year
that
may
be
hinder
.
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
I
have
not
more
schooling
to
begin
with
than
a
charity
boy
;
but
I
see
pretty
soon
that
I
could
not
get
on
far
enough
without
master
account
,
and
I
learn
'em
between
work
hour
,
after
I
would
be
unlade
.
<EOS>
look
here
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
open
a
book
and
point
to
the
page

<EOS>
"
I
write
a
good
hand
enough
,
and
I
will
match
anybody
at
all
sort
of
reckon
by
the
head

and
I
get
it
all
by
hard
work
,
and
pay
for
it
out
of
my
own
earning
,
 
often
out
of
my
own
dinner
and
supper

<EOS>
and
I
look
into
the
nature
of
all
the
thing
we
have
to
do
in
the
business
,
and
pick
up
knowledge
as
I
go
about
my
work

turn
it
over
in

<EOS>
why
,
I
be
no
mechanic

I
never

to
be

I
have
think
of
a

two

never

it

whether

put
into

I
will
tell
you
what
it
be

<EOS>
Your

go
the

give
you
an
education

It
be
not
my

I
do
not

it

as
I

it
would
be

You
have
have
a
sort
of
learning
that
be
all
very
well
for
a
young
fellow
like
our
Mr.
Stephen
Guest

who
will
have
nothing
to
do

sign
check
all
his

may

well
have
Latin
inside
his

I
shall
soon
forget
it
all

it
make
no
difference
to
me

<EOS>
I
have
to
do
my
lesson
at
school

I
always

Your

dry
off
you

you
will
be

stick
after
that

it

whiten
your

take
the
rough
work
out

do

why

you

at

low
round

ladder

let
me
tell
you
,
if
you
mean
to
get
on
in
life

<EOS>
It
be
no

the

Mr.

<EOS>
well

I
have
no

find
with
that

<EOS>
I
be
willing

do
something
for
you

<EOS>
but
you
youngster
nowadays
think
you
be
to

with
live
well

work
easy

you
have
no
notion
of
run
afoot

<EOS>
now
,
you
must
remember
what
you
be

you
be
a
lad
of
sixteen
,
train
to
nothing
particular

<EOS>
there
be
heap
of
your

like
so
many
pebble

make
to
fit
in

<EOS>
well
,
you
may
be
apprentice
to
some
business
,
 
a
chemist

and
druggist
be
perhaps
;
your
Latin
may
come
in
a
bit
there

<EOS>
Tom
be
go
to

Mr.

put
up
his
hand
and
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
stop
!
<EOS>
hear
what
I
have
get
to
say

<EOS>
You
do
not

a

prentice

<EOS>
I
know
,
I
know
,
 
you
want
to
make
more
haste
,
and
you
do
not
want
to
stand
behind
a
counter

<EOS>
but
if
you
be
a
copying
-
clerk
,
you
will
have
to
stand
behind
a
desk
,
and
stare
at
your
ink
and
paper
all
day
;
there
be
not
much
out
-
look
there
,
and
you
will
not
be
much
wise
at
the
end
of
the
year
than
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
the
world
be
not
make
of
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper

and
if
you
be
to
get
on
in
the
world
,
young
man
,
you
must
know
what
the
world
's
make
of

<EOS>
now
the
good
chance
for
you
'
ud
be
to
have
a
place
on
a
wharf
,
or
in
a
warehouse
,
where
you
would
learn
the
smell
of
thing
,
but
you
would
not
like
that
,
I
will
be
bind
;
you
would
have
to
stand
cold
and
wet
,
and
be
shoulder
about
by
rough
fellow

You
be
too
fine
a

for
that

Mr.

pause

look
hard
at
Tom

who
certainly
feel
some
inward
struggle
before
he
could
reply

<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
do
what
will
be
good
for
me
in
the
end

I
would
put
up

disagreeable

that

well

it
out

you

it

lay
hold

you

It
be
the
mistake

you

yourself

you

wear
good

up

well

<EOS>
Mr.

put
out
his
hand

with
an
air
of
friendly
dismissal
,
and
Tom
have
not
courage
to
ask
another
question
,
especially
in
the
presence
of
Mr.
Spence
.
<EOS>
so
he
go
out
again
into
the
cold
damp
air
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
call
at
his
uncle
Glegg
be
about
the
money
in
the
Savings
Bank
,
and
by
the
time
he
set
out
again
the
mist
have
thicken
,
and
he
could
not
see
very
far
before
him
;
but
go
along
River
Street
again
,
he
be
startle
,
when
he
be
within
two
yard
of
the
projecting
side
of
a
shop
-
window
,
by
the
word
"
Dorlcote
mill
"
in
large
letter
on
a
hand

bill
,
place
as
if
on
purpose
to
stare
at
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
catalogue
of
the
sale
to
take
place
the
next
week

it
be
a
reason
for
hurry
faster
out
of
the
town

<EOS>
Poor
Tom
form
no
vision
of
the
distant
future
as
he
make
his
way
homeward
;
he
only
feel
that
the
present
be
very
hard
.
<EOS>
It
seem
a
wrong
toward
him
that
his
uncle
Deane
have
no
confidence
in
him
,
 
do
not
see
at
once
that
he
should
acquit
himself
well
,
which
Tom
himself
be
as
certain
of
as
of
the
daylight

<EOS>
apparently
he
,
Tom
Tulliver
,
be
likely
to
be
hold
of
small
account
in
the
world
;
and
for
the
first
time
he
feel
a
sinking
of
heart
under
the
sense
that
he
really
be
very
ignorant
,
and
could
do
very
little
.
<EOS>
who
be
that
enviable
young
man
that
could
tell
the
cubic
content
of
thing
in
no
time
,
and
make
suggestion
about
swedish
bark
!
<EOS>
Tom
have
be
use
to
be
so
entirely
satisfied
with
himself
,
in
spite
of
his
break
down
in
a
demonstration
,
and
construe
_
nunc
illa
promite
vis
_
as
"
now
promise
those
man
"
;
but
now
he
suddenly
feel
at
a
disadvantage
,
because
he
know
less
than
some
one
else
know
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
a
world
of
thing
connect
with
that
swedish
bark
,
which
,
if
he
only
know
them
,
may
have
help
him
to
get
on
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
much
easy
to
make
a
figure
with
a
spirited
horse
and
a
new
saddle

<EOS>
two
hour
ago
,
as
Tom
be
walk
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
he
see
the
distant
future
before
him
as
he
may
have
see
a
tempting
stretch
of
smooth
sandy
beach
beyond
a
belt
of
flinty
shingle
;
he
be
on
the
grassy
bank
then
,
and
think
the
shingle
may
soon
be
pass
.
<EOS>
but
now
his
foot
be
on
the
sharp
stone
;
the
belt
of
shingle
have
widen
,
and
the
stretch
of
sand
have
dwindle
into
narrowness
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
my
Uncle
Deane
say
,
Tom
?
"
say
Maggie

put
her

you

no

he
do
not
say
that

<EOS>
He
do
not
quite
promise
me
anything

he
seem
to

I
could
not

a
very
good

be

young

what

it
be
such
a
nuisance

I
have
be
at
school
all
this
while
learn
Latin

thing
,
 
not
a

now
my

I
must
set
about
learn
book

keeping
and
calculation

those
thing

He

Poor

<EOS>
he
have
just
come
from

make
to
feel
his
inferiority

the
reaction
of
his
strong

self

assert

must
take
place
somehow
;
and
here
be
a
case
in
which

could
justly
show

Maggie
's
cheek
flush
and
her
lip
quiver
with
conflict
resentment
and
affection
,
and
a
certain
awe
as
well
as
admiration
of
Tom
's
firm
and
more
effective
character
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
answer
immediately
;
very
angry
word
rise
to
her
lip
,
but
they
be
drive
back
again
,
and
she
say
at
last
:
  
"
You
often
think
I
be
conceited
,
Tom
,
when
I
do
not
mean
what
I
say
at
all

that
way
.
<EOS>
I
do
not

to
put
myself
above

I

you

better

I

harsh

word
the
resentment
be
rise
again

"
no

Tom
,
with
severe

<EOS>
"
I

always
kind
to
you

and
so
I

I

but
you

mind
what

"
  
Their
mother
come
in
now
,
and
Maggie
rush
away
,
that
her
burst
of
tear
,
which
she
feel
must
come
,
may
not
happen
till
she
be
safe
upstairs
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
bitter
tear
;
everybody
in
the
world
seem
so
hard
and
unkind
to
Maggie
;
there
be
no
indulgence
,
no
fondness
,
such
as
she
imagine
when
she
fashion
the
world
afresh
in
her
own
thought
.
<EOS>
in
book
there
be
people
who
be
always
agreeable
or
tender
,
and
delighted
to
do
thing
that
make
one
happy

who
do

their
kindness
by

fault

<EOS>
the
world
outside
the
book
be
not
a
happy
one
,
Maggie
feel
;
it
seem
to
be
a
world
where
people
behave
the
good
to
those
they
do
not
pretend
to
love
,
and
that
do
not
belong
to
them
.
<EOS>
and
if
life
have
no
love
in
it
,
what
else
be
there
for
Maggie
?
<EOS>
nothing
but
poverty
and
the
companionship
of
her
mother
's
narrow
griefs
,
perhaps
of
her
father
's
heart
-
cut
childish
dependence
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
hopelessness
so
sad
as
that
of
early
youth
,
when
the
soul
be
make
up
of
want
,
and
have
no
long
memory
,
no
superadde
life
in
the
life
of
other
;
though
we
who
look
on
think
lightly
of
such
premature
despair
,
as
if
our
vision
of
the
future
lighten
the
blind
sufferer
's
present
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
in
her
brown
frock
,
with
her
eye
redden
and
her
heavy
hair
push
back
,
look
from
the
bed
where
her
father
lie
to
the
dull
wall
of
this
sad
chamber
which
be
the
centre
of
her
world
,
be
a
creature
full
of
eager
,
passionate
longing
for
all
that
be
beautiful
and
glad
;
thirsty
for
all
knowledge
;
with
an
ear
strain
after
dreamy
music
that
die
away
and
would
not
come
near
to
her
;
with
a
blind
,
unconscious
yearning
for
something
that
would
link
together
the
wonderful
impression
of
this
mysterious
life
,
and
give
her
soul
a
sense
of
home
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
no
wonder
,
when
there
be
this
contrast
between
the
outward
and
the
inward
,
that
painful
collision
come
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
tend
to
Refute
the
Popular
Prejudice
against
the
present
of
a
Pocket

knife
  
<EOS>
in
that
dark
time
of
December
,
the
sale
of
the
household
furniture
last
beyond
the
middle
of
the
second
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
have
begin
,
in
his
interval
of
consciousness
,
to
manifest
an
irritability
which
often
appear
to
have
as
a
direct
effect
the
recurrence
of
spasmodic
rigidity
and
insensibility
,
have
lain
in
this
live
death
throughout
the
critical
hour
when
the
noise
of
the
sale
come
near
to
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
have
decide
that
it
would
be
a
less
risk
to
let
him
remain
where
he
be
than
to
remove
him
to
Luke
's
cottage
,
 
a
plan
which
the
good
Luke
have
propose
to
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
think
it
would
be
very
bad
if
the
master
be
"
to
waken
up
"
at
the
noise
of
the
sale
;
and
the
wife
and
child
have
sit
imprison
in
the
silent
chamber
,
watch
the
large
prostrate
figure
on
the
bed
,
and
tremble
lest
the
blank
face
should
suddenly
show
some
response
to
the
sound
which
fall
on
their
own
ear
with
such
obstinate
,
painful
repetition
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
over
at
last
,
that
time
of
importunate
certainty
and
eye
-
strain
suspense
.
<EOS>
the
sharp
sound
of
a
voice
,
almost
as
metallic
as
the
rap
that
follow
it
,
have
cease
;
the
tramping
of
footstep
on
the
gravel
have
die
out
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
blond
face
seem
aged
ten
year
by
the
last
thirty
hour

the
poor
woman
's
mind
have
be
busy
divine
when
her
favorite
thing
be
be
knock
down
by
the
terrible
hammer
;
her
heart
have
be
flutter
at
the
thought
that
first
one
thing
and
then
another
have
go
to
be
identify
as
her
in
the
hateful
publicity
of
the
Golden
Lion

and
all
the
while
she
have
to
sit
and
make
no
sign
of
this
inward
agitation
.
<EOS>
such
thing
bring
line

well

and
broaden
the
streak

white
among
the

She

Her

It

<EOS>
the

in

by
the
imperfect
fire

candle
light

Tom
have
not
even
an
indefinite
sense
of
any
acquaintance
with
the
rather
broad

set
but
active
figure
,
perhaps
two
year
old
than
himself
,
that
look
at
him
with
a
pair
of
blue
eye
set
in
a

pull
some
curly

It

be
so
much
as

<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
,
in
reply
,
doubt
whether
that
be
precisely
the
relation
between
the
two
mill
which
would
determine
their
value
as
investment
.
<EOS>
as
for
uncle
Glegg
,
the
thing
lie
quite
beyond
his
imagination
;
the
good
-
natured
man
feel
sincere
pity
for
the
Tulliver
family
,
but
his
money
be
all
lock
up
in
excellent
mortgage
,
and
he
could
run
no
risk
;
that
would
be
unfair
to
his
own
relative
;
but
he
have
make
up
his
mind
that
Tulliver
should
have
some
new
flannel
waistcoat
which
he
have
himself
renounce
in
favor
of
a
more
elastic
commodity
,
and
that
he
would
buy
Mrs.
Tulliver
a
pound
of
tea
now
and
then
;
it
would
be
a
journey
which
his
benevolence
delight
in
beforehand
,
to
carry
the
tea
and
see
her
pleasure
on
be
assure
it
be
the
good
black
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
it
be
clear
that
Mr.
Deane
be
kindly
dispose
toward
the
Tullivers
.
<EOS>
one
day
he
have
bring
Lucy
,
who
be
come
home
for
the
Christmas
holiday
,
and
the
little
blond
angel
-
head
have
press
itself
against
Maggie
's
dark
cheek
with
many
kiss
and
some
tear
.
<EOS>
these
fair
slim
daughter
keep
up
a
tender
spot
in
the
heart
of
many
a
respectable
partner
in
a
respectable
firm
,
and
perhaps
Lucy
's
anxious
,
pity
question
about
her
poor
cousin
help
to
make
uncle
Deane
more
prompt
in
find
Tom
a
temporary
place
in
the
warehouse
,
and
in
put
him
in
the
way
of
get
evening
lesson
in
book
-
keeping
and
calculation
.
  
<EOS>
that
may
have
cheer
the
lad
and
feed
his
hope
a
little
,
if
there
have
not
come
at
the
same
time
the
much
-
dread
blow
of
finding
that
his
father
must
be
a
bankrupt
,
after
all
;
at
least
,
the
creditor
must
be
ask
to
take
less
than
their
due
,
which
to
Tom
's
untechnical
mind
<EOS>
be
the
same
thing
as
bankruptcy
.
<EOS>
His
father
must
not
only
be
say
to
have
"
lose
his
property
,
"
but
to
have
"
fail
,
"
 
the
word
that
carry
the
bad
obloquy
to
Tom
's
mind
.
<EOS>
for
when
the
defendant
's
claim
for
cost
have
be
satisfy
,
there
would
remain
the
friendly
bill
of
Mr.
Gore
,
and
the
deficiency
at
the
bank
,
as
well
as
the
other
debt
which
would
make
the
asset
shrink
into
unequivocal
disproportion
;
"
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
shilling
in
the
pound
,
"
predict
Mr.
Deane
,
in
a
decide
tone
,
tighten
his
lip
;
and
the
word
fall
on
Tom
like
a
scalding
liquie
,
leave
a
continual
smart
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
sadly
in
want
of
something
to
keep
up
his
spirit
a
little
in
the
unpleasant
newness
of
his
position
,
 
suddenly
transport
from
the
easy
carpet
_
ennui
_
of
study
-
hour
at
Mr.
Stelling
's
,
and
the
busy
idleness
of
castle
-
building
in
a
"
last
half
"
at
school
,
to
the
companionship
of
sack
and
hide
,
and
bawl
man
thunder
down
heavy
weight
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
the
first
step
toward
get
on
in
the
world
be
a
chill
,
dusty
,
noisy
affair
,
and
imply
go
without
one
's
tea
in
order
to
stay
in
St.
Ogg
's
and
have
an
evening
lesson
from
a
one
-
armed
elderly
clerk
,
in
a
room
smell
strongly
of
bad
tobacco
.
<EOS>
Tom
's
young
pink
-
and
-
white
face
have
its
color
very
much
deaden
by
the
time
he
take
off
his
hat
at
home
,
and
sit
down
with
keen
hunger
to
his
supper
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
he
be
a
little
cross
if
his
mother
or
Maggie
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
this
while
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
brood
over
a
scheme
by
which
she
,
and
no
one
else
,
would
avert
the
result
most
to
be
dread
,
and
prevent
Wakem
from
entertain
the
purpose
of
bidding
for
the
mill
.
<EOS>
imagine
a
truly
respectable
and
amiable
hen
,
by
some
portentous
anomaly
,
take
to
reflection
and
invent
combination
by
which
she
may
prevail
on
Hodge
not
to
wring
her
neck
,
or
send
her
and
her
chick
to
market
;
the
result
could
hardly
be
other
than
much
cackle
and
fluttering
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
see
that
everything
have
go
wrong
,
have
begin
to
think
she
have
be
too
passive
in
life
;
and
that
,
if
she
have
apply
her
mind
to
business
,
and
take
a
strong
resolution
now
and
then
,
it
would
have
be
all
the
well
for
her
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
nobody
,
it
appear
,
have
think
of
go
to
speak
to
Wakem
on
this
business
of
the
mill
;
and
yet
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
reflect
,
it
would
have
be
quite
the
short
method
of
secure
the
right
end
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
of
no
use
,
to
be
sure
,
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
go
,
 
even
if
he
have
be
able
and
willing
,
 
for
he
have
be
"
go
to
law
against
Wakem
"
and
abuse
him
for
the
last
ten
year
;
Wakem
be
always
likely
to
have
a
spite
against
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
that
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
her
husband
be
very
much
in
the
wrong
to
bring
her
into
this
trouble
,
she
be
incline
to
think
that
his
opinion
of
Wakem
be
wrong
too
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
Wakem
have
"
put
the
bailie
in
the
house
,
and
sell
them
up
"
;
but
she
suppose
he
do
that
to
please
the
man
that
lend
Mr.
Tulliver
the
money
,
for
a
lawyer
have
more
folk
to
please
than
one
,
and
he
be
not
likely
to
put
Mr.
Tulliver
,
who
have
go
to
law
with
him
,
above
everybody
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
attorney
may
be
a
very
reasonable
man
;
why
not
?
<EOS>
He
have
marry
a
Miss
Clint
,
and
at
the
time
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
hear
of
that
marriage
,
the
summer
when
she
wear
her
blue
satin
spencer
,
and
have
not
yet
any
thought
of
Mr.
Tulliver
,
she
know
no
harm
of
Wakem
.
<EOS>
and
certainly
toward
herself
,
whom
he
know
to
have
be
a
Miss
Dodson
<EOS>
,
it
be
out
of
all
possibility
that
he
could
entertain
anything
but
good
-
will
,
when
it
be
once
bring
home
to
his
observation
that
she
,
for
her
part
,
have
never
want
to
go
to
law
,
and
indeed
be
at
present
disposed
to
take
Mr.
Wakem
's
view
of
all
subject
rather
than
her
husband
's
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
if
that
attorney
see
a
respectable
matron
like
herself
dispose
"
to
give
him
good
word
,
"
why
should
not
he
listen
to
her
representation
?
<EOS>
for
she
would
put
the
matter
clearly
before
him
,
which
have
never
be
do
yet
.
<EOS>
and
he
would
never
go
and
bid
for
the
mill
on
purpose
to
spite
her
,
an
innocent
woman
,
who
think
it
likely
enough
that
she
have
dance
with
him
in
their
youth
at
Squire
Darleigh
's
,
for
at
those
big
dance
she
have
often
and
often
dance
with
young
man
whose
name
she
have
forget
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
hide
these
reasoning
in
her
own
bosom
;
for
when
she
have
throw
out
a
hint
to
Mr.
Deane
and
Mr.
Glegg
that
she
would
not
mind
go
to
speak
to
Wakem
herself
,
they
have
say
,
"
no
,
no
,
no
,
"
and
"
Pooh
,
pooh
,
"
and
"
let
Wakem
alone
,
"
in
the
tone
of
man
who
be
not
likely
to
give
a
candid
attention
to
a
more
definite
exposition
of
her
project
;
still
less
dare
she
mention
the
plan
to
Tom
and
Maggie
,
for
"
the
child
be
always
so
against
everything
their
mother
say
"
;
and
Tom
,
she
observe
,
be
almost
as
much
set
against
Wakem
as
his
father
be
.
<EOS>
but
this
unusual
concentration
of
thought
naturally
give
Mrs.
Tulliver
an
unusual
power
of
device
and
determination
:
and
a
day
or
two
before
the
sale
,
to
be
hold
at
the
Golden
Lion
,
when
there
be
no
longer
any
time
to
be
lose
,
she
carry
out
her
plan
by
a
stratagem
.
<EOS>
there
be
pickle
in
question
,
a
large
stock
of
pickle
and
ketchup
which
Mrs.
Tulliver
possess
,
and
which
Mr.
Hyndmarsh
,
the
grocer
,
would
certainly
purchase
if
she
could
transact
the
business
in
a
personal
interview
,
so
she
would
walk
with
Tom
to
St.
Ogg
be
that
morning
;
and
when
Tom
urge
that
she
may
let
the
pickle
be
at
present
,
 
he
do
not
like
her
to
go
about
just
yet
<EOS>
,
 
<EOS>
she
appear
so
hurt
at
this
conduct
in
her
son
,
contradict
her
about
pickle
which
she
have
make
after
the
family
receipt
inherit
from
his
own
grandmother
,
who
have
die
when
his
mother
be
a
little
girl
,
that
he
give
way
,
and
they
walk
together
until
she
turn
toward
Danish
Street
,
where
Mr.
Hyndmarsh
retail
his
grocery
,
not
far
from
the
office
of
Mr.
Wakem
.
  
<EOS>
that
gentleman
be
not
yet
come
to
his
office
;
would
Mrs.
Tulliver
sit
down
by
the
fire
in
his
private
room
and
wait
for
him
?
<EOS>
She
have
not
long
to
wait
before
the
punctual
attorney
enter
,
knit
his
brow
with
an
examine
glance
at
the
stout
blond
woman
who
rise
,
curtsy
deferentially
,
 
a
tallish
man
,
with
an
aquiline
nose
and
abundant
iron
-
gray
hair
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
see
Mr.
Wakem
before
,
and
be
possibly
wonder
whether
he
be
really
as
eminent
a
rascal
,
and
as
crafty
,
bitter
an
enemy
of
honest
humanity
in
general
,
and
of
Mr.
Tulliver
in
particular
,
as
he
be
represent
to
be
in
that
eidolon
or
portrait
of
him
which
we
have
see
to
exist
in
the
miller
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
irascible
miller
be
a
man
to
interpret
any
chance
-
shoot
that
graze
him
as
an
attempt
on
his
own
life
,
and
be
liable
to
entanglement
in
this
puzzling
world
,
which
,
due
consideration
have
to
his
own
infallibility
,
require
the
hypothesis
of
a
very
active
diabolical
agency
to
explain
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
possible
to
believe
that
the
attorney
be
not
more
guilty
toward
him
than
an
ingenious
machine
,
which
perform
its
work
with
much
regularity
,
be
guilty
toward
the
rash
man
who
,
venture
too
near
it
,
be
catch
up
by
some
fly
-
wheel
or
other
,
and
suddenly
convert
into
unexpected
mince
-
meat
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
really
impossible
to
decide
this
question
by
a
glance
at
his
person
;
the
line
and
light
of
the
human
countenance
be
like
other
symbol
,
 
not
always
easy
to
read
without
a
key
.
<EOS>
on
an
_
a
priori
_
view
of
Wakem
's
aquiline
nose
,
which
offend
Mr.
Tulliver
,
there
be
not
more
rascality
than
in
the
shape
of
his
stiff
shirt
-
collar
,
though
this
too
along
with
his
nose
,
may
have
become
fraught
with
damnatory
meaning
when
once
the
rascality
be
ascertain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
I
think
?

Mr.

Mrs.

she

really
in

of
the
formidable

reflect
that
she
have
not

with
herself
how
she
should

<EOS>
Mr.

feel
in
his

look
at
her
in
silence

<EOS>

I

the

<EOS>
Mrs.

shake
her

a
little
,
and
look
at
the

thing
about

an

inaudible
whistle

it

be

for
it

his

the

his

build
it

though
I
be
not
fond
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
the
noise
of
it

when
first
I
be

for
there
be
no

not
the
Dodson

if
I
would
know
as
the

it

I
go

everything

<EOS>

oh

it
be

it

look
more

what
use

to

if

<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.

's
voice
tremble
a
little
,
and
she
could
make
no
answer
to
the
attorney
's
"
good
morning

curtsy
and
walk
out
in
silence

Mr.

Next

Friday
at

o'clock

<EOS>
"
oh
,
just
run
to
Winship
be
the
auctioneer

see
if

at
home

<EOS>
I
have
some
business
for
him
;
ask
him
to
come
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
although
,
when
Mr.
Wakem
enter
his
office
that
morning
,
he
have
have
no
intention
of
purchase
Dorlcote
Mill
,
his
mind
be
already
make
up
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
suggest
to
him
several
determine
motive
,
and
his
mental
glance
be
very
rapid
;
he
be
one
of
those
man
who
can
be
prompt
without
be
rash
,
because
their
motive
run
in
fix
track
,
and
they
have
no
need
to
reconcile
conflicting
aim
.
  
<EOS>
to
suppose
that
Wakem
have
the
same
sort
of
inveterate
hatred
toward
Tulliver
that
Tulliver
have
toward
him
would
be
like
suppose
that
a
pike
and
a
roach
can
look
at
each
other
from
a
similar
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
the
roach
necessarily
abhor
the
mode
in
which
the
pike
get
his
living
,
and
the
pike
be
likely
to
think
nothing
further
even
of
the
most
indignant
roach
than
that
he
be
excellent
good
eating
;
it
could
only
be
when
the
roach
choke
him
that
the
pike
could
entertain
a
strong
personal
animosity
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Tulliver
have
ever
seriously
injure
or
thwart
the
attorney
,
Wakem
would
not
have
refuse
him
the
distinction
of
be
a
special
object
of
his
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
but
when
Mr.
Tulliver
call
Wakem
a
rascal
at
the
market
dinner
-
table
,
the
attorney
'
client
be
not
a
whit
incline
to
withdraw
their
business
from
him
;
and
if
,
when
Wakem
himself
happen
to
be
present
,
some
jocose
cattle
-
feeder
,
stimulate
by
opportunity
and
brandy
,
make
a
thrust
at
him
by
allude
to
old
lady
'
will
,
he
maintain
perfect
<EOS>
_
sing
froid
_
,
and
know
quite
well
that
the
majority
of
substantial
man
then
present
be
perfectly
content
with
the
fact
that
"
Wakem
be
Wakem
"
;
that
be
to
say
,
a
man
who
always
know
the
stepping
-
stone
that
would
carry
him
through
very
muddy
bit
of
practice
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
have
make
a
large
fortune
,
have
a
handsome
house
among
the
tree
at
Tofton
,
and
decidedly
the
fine
stock
of
port
-
wine
in
the
neighborhood
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
be
likely
to
feel
himself
on
a
level
with
public
opinion
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
not
sure
that
even
honest
Mr.
Tulliver
himself
,
with
his
general
view
of
law
as
a
cockpit
,
may
not
,
under
opposite
circumstance
,
have
see
a
fine
appropriateness
in
the
truth
that
"
Wakem
be
Wakem
"
;
since
I
have
understand
from
person
verse
in
history
,
that
mankind
be
not
disposed
to
look
narrowly
into
the
conduct
of
great
victor
when
their
victory
be
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
Tulliver
,
then
,
could
be
no
obstruction
to
Wakem
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
be
a
poor
devil
whom
the
lawyer
have
defeat
several
time
;
a
hot
-
tempered
fellow
,
who
would
always
give
you
a
handle
against
him
.
<EOS>
Wakem
's
conscience
be
not
uneasy
because
he
have
use
a
few
trick
against
the
miller
;
why
should
he
hate
that
unsuccessful
plaintiff
,
that
pitiable
,
furious
bull
entangle
in
the
mesh
of
a
net
?
  
<EOS>
still
,
among
the
various
excess
to
which
human
nature
be
subject
,
moralist
have
never
number
that
of
be
too
fond
of
the
people
who
openly
revile
us
.
<EOS>
the
successful
yellow
candidate
for
the
borough
of
Old
Topping
,
perhaps
,
feel
no
pursuant
meditative
hatred
toward
the
blue
editor
who
console
his
subscriber
with
vituperative
rhetoric
against
yellow
man
who
sell
their
country
,
and
be
the
demon
of
private
life
;
but
he
may
not
be
sorry
,
if
law
and
opportunity
favor
,
to
kick
that
blue
editor
to
a
deep
shade
of
his
favorite
color
.
<EOS>
prosperous
man
take
a
little
vengeance
now
and
then
,
as
they
take
a
diversion
,
when
it
come
easily
in
their
way
,
and
be
no
hindrance
to
business
;
and
such
small
unimpassioned
revenge
have
an
enormous
effect
in
life
,
run
through
all
degree
of
pleasant
infliction
,
block
the
fit
man
out
of
place
,
and
blacken
character
in
unpremeditated
talk
.
<EOS>
still
more
,
to
see
people
who
have
be
only
insignificantly
offensive
to
us
reduce
in
life
and
humiliate
,
without
any
special
effort
of
ours
,
be
apt
to
have
a
soothing
,
flattering
influence
.
<EOS>
Providence
or
some
other
prince
of
this
world
,
it
appear
,
have
undertake
the
task
of
retribution
for
us
;
and
really
,
by
an
agreeable
constitution
of
thing
,
our
enemy
somehow
_
do
not
_
prosper
.
  
<EOS>
Wakem
be
not
without
this
parenthetic
vindictiveness
toward
the
uncomplimentary
miller
;
and
now
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
put
the
notion
into
his
head
,
it
present
itself
to
him
as
a
pleasure
to
do
the
very
thing
that
would
cause
Mr.
Tulliver
<EOS>
the
most
deadly
mortification
,
  
and
a
pleasure
of
a
complex
kind
,
not
make
up
of
crude
malice
,
but
mingle
with
it
the
relish
of
self
-
approbation
.
<EOS>
to
see
an
enemy
humiliate
give
a
certain
contentment
,
but
this
be
jejune
compare
with
the
highly
blent
satisfaction
of
see
him
humiliate
by
your
benevolent
action
or
concession
on
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
sort
of
revenge
which
fall
into
the
scale
of
virtue
,
and
Wakem
be
not
without
an
intention
of
keep
that
scale
respectably
fill
.
<EOS>
He
have
once
have
the
pleasure
of
put
an
old
enemy
of
his
into
one
of
the
St.
Ogg
's
alm
-
house
,
to
the
rebuilding
of
which
he
have
give
a
large
subscription
;
and
here
be
an
opportunity
of
provide
for
another
by
make
him
his
own
servant
.
<EOS>
such
thing
give
a
completeness
to
prosperity
,
and
contribute
element
of
agreeable
consciousness
that
be
not
dream
of
by
that
short
-
sight
,
overheated
vindictiveness
which
go
out
its
way
to
wreak
itself
in
direct
injury
.
<EOS>
and
Tulliver
,
with
his
rough
tongue
file
by
a
sense
of
obligation
,
would
make
a
well
servant
than
any
chance
-
fellow
who
be
cap
-
in
-
hand
for
a
situation
.
<EOS>
Tulliver
be
know
to
be
a
man
of
proud
honesty
,
and
Wakem
be
too
acute
not
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
honesty
.
<EOS>
He
be
give
too
observe
individual
,
not
to
judge
of
them
accord
to
maxims
,
and
no
one
know
better
than
he
that
all
man
be
not
like
himself
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
intend
to
overlook
the
whole
business
of
land
and
mill
pretty
closely
;
he
be
fond
of
these
practical
rural
matter
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
good
reason
for
purchase
Dorlcote
Mill
,
quite
apart
from
any
benevolent
vengeance
on
the
miller
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
a
capital
investment
;
besides
,
Guest
&
co.
be
go
to
bid
for
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Guest
and
Mr.
Wakem
be
on
friendly
dining
term
,
and
the
attorney
like
to
predominate
over
a
ship
-
owner
and
mill
-
owner
who
be
a
little
too
loud
in
the
town
affair
as
well
as
in
his
table
-
talk
.
<EOS>
for
Wakem
be
not
a
mere
man
of
business
;
he
be
consider
a
pleasant
fellow
in
the
upper
circle
of
St.
Ogg
's
 
chat
amusingly
over
his
port
-
wine
,
do
a
little
amateur
farming
,
and
have
certainly
be
an
excellent
husband
and
father
;
at
church
,
when
he
go
there
,
he
sit
under
the
handsome
of
mural
monument
erect
to
the
memory
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Most
man
would
have
marry
again
under
his
circumstance
,
but
he
be
say
to
be
more
tender
to
his
deformed
son
than
most
man
be
to
their
good
-
shapen
offspring
.
<EOS>
not
that
Mr.
Wakem
have
not
other

but
toward
them
he
hold
only
a
chiaroscuro
parentage
,
and
provide
for
them
in
a
grade
of
life
duly
beneath
his

<EOS>
in
this
fact
,
indeed
,
there
lie
the
clench
motive
to
the
purchase
of
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
while
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
talk
,
it
have
occur
to
the
rapid
-
minded
lawyer
,
among
all
the
other
circumstance
of
the
case
,
that
this
purchase
would
,
in
a
few
year
to
come
,
furnish
a
highly
suitable
position
for
a
certain
favorite
lad
whom
he
mean
to
bring
on
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
mental
condition
on
which
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
undertake
to
act
persuasively
,
and
have
fail
;
a
fact
which
may
receive
some
illustration
from
the
remark
of
a
great
philosopher
,
that
fly
-
fisher
fail
in
prepare
their
bait
so
as
to
make
it
alluring
in
the
right
quarter
,
for
want
of
a
due
acquaintance
with
the
subjectivity
of

Daylight
on
the
Wreck
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
clear
frosty
January
day
on
which
Mr.
Tulliver
first
come
downstairs
.
<EOS>
the
bright
sun
on
the
chestnut
bough
and
the
roof
opposite
his
window
have
make
him
impatiently
declare
that
he
would
be
cage
up
no
longer
;
he
think
everywhere
would
be
more
cheery
under
this
sunshine
than
his
bedroom
;
for
he
know
nothing
of
the
bareness
below
,
which
make
the
flood
of
sunshine
importunate
,
as
if
it
have
an
unfeeling
pleasure
in
show
the
empty
place
,
and
the
mark
where
well
-
know
object
once
have
be
.
<EOS>
the
impression
on
his
mind
that
it
be
<EOS>
but
yesterday
when
he
receive
the
letter
from
Mr.
Gore
be
so
continually
imply
in
his
talk
,
and
the
attempt
to
convey
to
him
the
idea
that
many
week
have
pass
and
much
have
happen
since
then
have
be
so
soon
sweep
away
by
recurrent
forgetfulness
,
that
even
Mr.
Turnbull
have
begin
to
despair
of
prepare
him
to
meet
the
fact
by
previous
knowledge
.
<EOS>
the
full
sense
of
the
present
could
only
be
impart
gradually
by
new
experience
,
 
not
by
mere
word
,
which
must
remain
weak
than
the
impression
leave
by
the
_
old
_
experience
.
<EOS>
this
resolution
to
come
downstairs
be
hear
with
tremble
by
the
wife
and
child
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
say
Tom
must
not
go
to
St.
Ogg
's
at
the
usual
hour
,
he
must
wait
and
see
his
father
downstairs
;
and
Tom
comply
,
though
with
an
intense
inward
shrink
from
the
painful
scene
.
<EOS>
the
heart
of
all
three
have
be
more
deeply
dejected
than
ever
during
the
last
few
day
.
<EOS>
for
Guest
&
Co.
have
not
buy
the
mill
;
both
mill
and
land
have
be
knock
down
to
Wakem
,
who
have
be
over
the
premise
,
and
have
lay
before
Mr.
Deane
and
Mr.
Glegg
,
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
presence
,
his
willingness
to
employ
Mr.
Tulliver
,
in
case
of
his
recovery
,
as
a
manager
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
this
proposition
have
occasion
much
family
debate
.
<EOS>
uncle
and
aunt
be
almost
unanimously
of
opinion
that
such
an
offer
ought
not
to
be
reject
when
there
be
nothing
in
the
way
but
a
feeling
in
Mr.
Tulliver
's
mind
,
which
,
as
neither
aunt
nor
uncle
share
it
,
be
regard
as
entirely
unreasonable
and
childish
,
 
indeed
,
as
a
transferring
toward
Wakem
of
that
indignation
and
hatred
which
Mr.
Tulliver
ought
properly
to
have
direct
against
himself
for
his
general
quarrelsomeness
,
and
his
special
exhibition
of
it
in
go
to
law
.
<EOS>
here
be
an
opportunity
for
Mr.
Tulliver
to
provide
for
his
wife
and
daughter
without
any
assistance
from
his
wife
's
relation
,
and
without
that
too
evident
descent
into
pauperism
which
make
it
annoying
to
respectable
people
to
meet
the
degrade
member
of
the
family
by
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
,
Mrs.
Glegg
consider
,
must
be
make
to
feel
,
when
he
come
to
his
right
mind
,
that
he
could
never
humble
himself
enough
;
for
_
that
_
have
come
which
she
have
always
foresee
would
come
of
his
insolence
in
time
past
"
to
them
as
be
the
good
friend
he
would
get
to
look
to
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Glegg
and
Mr.
Deane
be
less
stern
in
their
view
,
but
they
both
of
them
think
Tulliver
have
do
enough
harm
by
his
hot
-
tempered
crotchet
and
ought
to
put
them
out
of
the
question
when
a
livelihood
be
offer
him
;
Wakem
show
a
right
feeling
about
the
matter
,
 
_
he
_
have
no
grudge
against
Tulliver
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
have
protest
against
entertain
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
like
his
father
to
be
under
Wakem
;
he
think
it
would
look
mean
-
spirited
;
but
his
mother
's
main
distress
be
the
utter
impossibility
of
ever
"
turn
Mr.
Tulliver
round
about
Wakem
,
"
or
get
him
to
hear
reason
;
no
,
they
would
all
have
to
go
and
live
in
a
pigsty
on
purpose
to
spite
Wakem
,
who
speak
"
so
as
nobody
could
be
fair

<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
mind
be
reduce
to
such
confusion
by
live
in
this
strange
medium
of
unaccountable
sorrow
,
against
which
she

when

<EOS>
altogether
,
this
time
of
trouble

rather
a
saturnalian

should
have

breath
of

needful
piece

<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.

submissively
downstairs
;
to
be
order
about

a
servant
be
the
last
remnant

<EOS>
an
Item
add
to
the
Family
Register
  
<EOS>
that
first
moment
of
renunciation
and
submission
be
follow
by
day
of
violent
struggle
in
the
miller
's
mind
,
as
the
gradual
access
of
bodily
strength
bring
with
it
increase
ability
to
embrace
in
one
view
all
the
conflicting
condition
under
which
he
find
himself
.
<EOS>
feeble
limb
easily
resign
themselves
to
be
tether
,
and
when
we
be
subdue
by
sickness
it
seem
possible
to
us
to
fulfil
pledge
which
the
old
vigor
come
back
and
break
.
<EOS>
there
be
time
when
poor
Tulliver
think
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
to
Bessy
be
something
quite
too
hard
for
human
nature
;
he
have
promise
her
without
know
what
she
be
go
to
say
,
 
she
may
as
well
have
ask
him
to
carry
a
ton
weight
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
but
again
,
there
be
many
feeling
argue
on
her
side
,
besides
the
sense
that
life
have
be
make
hard
to
her
by
have
marry
him
.
<EOS>
He
see
a
possibility
,
by
much
pinch
,
of
save
money
out
of
his
salary
toward
pay
a
second
dividend
to
his
creditor
,
and
it
would
not
be
easy
elsewhere
to
get
a
situation
such
as
he
could
fill
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
lead
an
easy
life
,
order
much
and
work
little
,
and
have
no
aptitude
for
any
new
business
.
<EOS>
He
must
perhaps
take
to
day
-
labor
,
and
his
wife
must
have
help
from
her
sister
,
 
a
prospect
doubly
bitter
to
him
,
now
they
have
let
all
Bessy
's
precious
thing
be
sell
,
probably
because
they
like
to
set
her
against
him
,
by
make
her
feel
that
he
have
bring
her
to
that
pass
.
<EOS>
He
listen
to
their
admonitory
talk
,
when
they
come
to
urge
on
him
what
he
be
bind
to
do
for
poor
Bessy
's
sake
,
with
averted
eye
,
that
every
now
and
then
flash
on
them
furtively
when
their
back
be
turn
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
dread
of
need
their
help
could
have
make
it
an
easy
alternative
to
take
their
advice
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
strong
influence
of
all
be
the
love
of
the
old
premise
where
he
have
run
about
when
he
be
a
boy
,
just
as
Tom
have
do
after
him
.
<EOS>
the
Tullivers
have
live
on
this
spot
for
generation
,
and
he
have
sit
listen
on
a
low
stool
on
winter
evening
while
his
father
talk
of
the
old
half
-
timbered
mill
that
have
be
there
before
the
last
great
flood
which
damage
it
so
that
his
grandfather
pull
it
down
and
build
the
new
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
when
he
get
able
to
walk
about
and
look
at
all
the
old
object
that
he
feel
the
strain
of
his
cling
affection
for
the
old
home
as
part
of
his
life
,
part
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
think
of
himself
live
on
any
other
spot
than
this
,
where
he
know
the
sound
of
every
gate
door
,
and
feel
that
the
shape
and
color
of
every
roof
and
weather
-
stain
and
break
hillock
be
good
,
because
his
grow
sense
have
be
feed
on
them
.
<EOS>
Our
instructed
vagrancy
,
which
be
hardly
time
to
linger
by
the
hedgerow
,
but
run
away
early
to
the
tropic
,
and
be
at
home
with
palm
and
banyans
,
 
which
be
nourish
on
book
of
travel
and
stretch
the
theatre
of
its
imagination
to
the
Zambesi
,
 
can
hardly
get
a
dim
notion
of
what
an
old
-
fashioned
man
like
Tulliver
feel
for
this
spot
,
where
all
his
memory
centre
,
and
where
life
seem
like
a
familiar
smooth
-
handle
tool
that
the
finger
clutch
with
love
ease
.
<EOS>
and
just
now
he
be
live
in
that
freshen
memory
of
the
far
-
off
time
which
come
to
us
in
the
passive
hour
of
recovery
from
sickness
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
Luke
,
"
he
say
one
afternoon
,
as
he
stand
look
over
the
orchard
gate
,
"
I
remember
the
day
they
plant
those
apple

tree

<EOS>
My
father
be
a
huge
man
for
planting

<EOS>
it
be
like
a

making
to
him
to
get
a
cart
full
o

I
use
to
stand
i

the
cold
with
him

follow
him
about
like

<EOS>
then
he
turn
round
,

lean
against
the

look
at
the
opposite

a
day
of
romance
;
if
those
robber
-
baron
be
somewhat
grim
and
drunken
ogre
,
they
have
a
certain
grandeur
of
the
wild
beast
in
them
,
 
they
be
forest
boar
with
tusk
,
tear
and
rend
,
not
the
ordinary
domestic
grunter
;
they
represent
the
demon
force
forever
in
collision
with
beauty
,
virtue
,
and
the
gentle
use
of
life
;
they
make
a
fine
contrast
in
the
picture
with
the
wander
minstrel
,
the
soft
-
lip
princess
,
the
pious
recluse
,
and
the
timid
Israelite
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
time
of
color
,
when
the
sunlight
fall
on
glance
steel
and
float
banner
;
a
time
of
adventure
and
fierce
struggle
,
 
nay
,
of
living
,
religious
art
and
religious
enthusiasm
;
for
be
not
cathedral
build
in
those
day
,
and
do
not
great
emperor
leave
their
western
palace
to
die
before
the
infidel
stronghold
in
the
sacred
East
?
<EOS>
therefore
it
be
that
these
Rhine
castle
thrill
me
with
a
sense
of
poetry
;
they
belong
to
the
grand
historic
life
of
humanity
,
and
raise
up
for
me
the
vision
of
an
echo
.
<EOS>
but
these
dead
-
tint
,
hollow
-
eyed
,
angular
skeleton
of
village
on
the
Rhone
oppress
me
with
the
feeling
that
human
life
 
very
much
of
it
 
be
a
narrow
,
ugly
,
grovel
existence
,
which
even
calamity
do
not
elevate
,
but
rather
tend
to
exhibit
in
all
its
bare
vulgarity
of
conception
;
and
I
have
a
cruel
conviction
that
the
life
these
ruin
be
the
trace
of
<EOS>
be
part
of
a
gross
sum
of
obscure
vitality
,
that
will
be
sweep
into
the
same
oblivion
with
the
generation
of
ant
and
beaver
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
something
akin
to
this
oppressive
feeling
may
have
weigh
upon
you
in
watch
this
old
-
fashioned
family
life
on
the
bank
of
the
Floss
,
which
even
sorrow
hardly
suffice
to
lift
above
the
level
of
the
tragi
-
comic
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sordid
life
,
you
say
,
this
of
the
Tullivers
and
Dodsons
,
irradiate
by
no
sublime
principle
,
no
romantic
vision
,
no
active
,
self
-
renounce
faith
;
move
by
none
of
those
wild
,
uncontrollable
passion
which
create
the
dark
shadow
of
misery
and
crime
;
without
that
primitive
,
rough
simplicity
of
want
,
that
hard
,
submissive
,
ill
-
pay
toil
,
<EOS>
that
childlike
spelling
-
out
of
what
nature
have
write
,
which
give
its
poetry
to
peasant
life
.
<EOS>
here
one
have
conventional
worldly
notion
and
habit
without
instruction
and
without
polish
,
surely
the
most
prosaic
form
of
human
life
;
proud
respectability
in
a
gig
of
unfashionable
build
;
worldliness
without
side
-
dish
.
<EOS>
observe
these
people
narrowly
,
even
when
the
iron
hand
of
misfortune
have
shake
them
from
their
unquestioning
hold
on
the
world
,
one
see
little
trace
of
religion
,
still
less
of
a
distinctively
christian
creed
.
<EOS>
Their
belief
in
the
Unseen
,
so
far
as
it
manifest
itself
at
all
,
seem
to
be
rather
a
pagan
kind
;
their
moral
notion
,
though
hold
with
strong
tenacity
,
seem
to
have
no
standard
beyond
hereditary
custom
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
live
among
such
people
;
you
be
stifle
for
want
of
an
outlet
toward
something
beautiful
,
great
,
or
noble
;
you
be
irritated
with
these
dull
man
and
woman
,
as
a
kind
of
population
out
of
keep
with
the
earth
on
which
they
live
,
 
with
this
rich
plain
where
the
great
river
flow
forever
onward
,
and
link
the
small
pulse
of
the
old
english
town
with
the
beating
of
the
world
's
mighty
heart
.
<EOS>
a
vigorous
superstition
,
that
lash
its
god
or
lash
its
own
back
,
seem
to
be
more
congruous
with
the
mystery
of
the
human
lot
,
than
the
mental
condition
of
these
emmet
-
like
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
.
  
<EOS>
I
share
with
you
this
sense
of
oppressive
narrowness
;
but
it
be
necessary
that
we
should
feel
it
,
if
we
care
to
understand
how
it
act
on
the
life
of
Tom
and
Maggie
,
 
how
it
have
act
on
young
nature
in
many
generation
,
that
in
the
onward
tendency
of
human
thing
have
rise
above
the
mental
level
of
the
generation
before
them
,
to
which
they
have
be
nevertheless
tie
by
the
strong
fibre
of
their
heart
.
<EOS>
the
suffering
,
whether
of
martyr
or
victim
,
which
belong
to
every
historical
advance
of
mankind
,
be
represent
in
this
way
in
every
town
,
and
by
hundred
of
obscure
hearth
;
and
we
need
not
shrink
from
this
comparison
of
small
thing
with
great
;
for
do
not
science
tell
us
that
its
high
striving
be
after
the
ascertainment
of
a
unity
which
shall
bind
the
small
thing
with
the
great
?
<EOS>
in
natural
science
,
I
have
understand
,
there
be
nothing
petty
to
the
mind
that
have
a
large
vision
of
relation
,
and
to
which
every
single
object
suggest
a
vast
sum
of
condition
.
<EOS>
It
be
surely
the
same
with
the
observation
of
human
life
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
the
religious
and
moral
idea
of
the
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
be
of
too
specific
a
kind
to
be
arrive
at
deductively
,
from
the
statement
that
they
be
part
of
the
protestant
population
of
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
Their
theory
of
life
have
its
core
of
soundness
,
as
all
theory
must
have
on
which
decent
and
prosperous
family
have
be
rear
and
have
flourish
;
but
it
have
the
very
slight
tincture
of
theology
.
<EOS>
if
,
in
the
maiden
day
of
the
Dodson
sister
,
their
bible
open
more
easily
at
some
part
than
other
,
it
be
because
of
dry
tulip
-
petal
,
which
have
be
distribute
quite
impartially
,
without
preference
for
the
historical
,
devotional
,
or
doctrinal
.
<EOS>
Their
religion
be
of
a
simple
,
semi
-
pagan
kind
,
but
there
be
no
heresy
in
it
,
 
if
heresy
properly
mean
choice
,
 
for
they
do
not
know
there
be
any
other
religion
,
except
that
of
chapel
-
goer
,
which
appear
to
run
in
family
,
like
asthma
.
<EOS>
how
_
should
_
they
know
?
<EOS>
the
vicar
of
their
pleasant
rural
parish
be
not
a
controversialist
,
but
a
good
hand
at
whist
,
and
one
who
have
a
joke
always
ready
for
a
bloom
female
parishioner
.
<EOS>
the
religion
of
the
Dodsons
consist
in
revere
whatever
be
customary
and
respectable
;
it
be
necessary
to
be
baptize
,
else
one
could
not
be
bury
in
the
church
-
yard
,
and
to
take
the
sacrament
before
death
,
as
a
security
against
more
dimly
understand
peril
;
but
it
be
of
equal
necessity
to
have
the
proper
pall
-
bearer
and
well
-
cure
ham
at
one
's
funeral
,
and
to
leave
an
unimpeachable
will
.
<EOS>
a
Dodson
would
not
be
tax
with
the
omission
of
anything
that
be
become
,
or
that
belong
to
that
eternal
fitness
of
thing
which
be
plainly
indicate
in
the
practice
of
the
most
substantial
parishioner
,
and
in
the
family
tradition
,
 
such
as
obedience
to
parent
,
faithfulness
to
kindred
,
industry
,
rigid
honesty
,
thrift
,
the
thorough
scouring
of
wooden
and
copper
utensil
,
the
hoarding
of
coin
likely
to
disappear
from
the
currency
,
the
production
of
first
-
rate
commodity
for
the
market
,
and
the
general
preference
of
whatever
be
home
-
make
.
<EOS>
the
Dodsons
be
a
very
proud
race
,
and
their
pride
lie
in
the
utter
frustration
of
all
desire
to
tax
them
with
a
breach
of
traditional
duty
or
propriety
.
<EOS>
a
wholesome
pride
in
many
respect
,
since
it
identify
honor
with
perfect
integrity
,
thoroughness
of
work
,
and
faithfulness
to
admit
rule
;
and
society
owe
some
worthy
quality
in
many
of
her
member
to
mother
of
the
Dodson
class
,
who
make
their
butter
and
their
fromenty
well
,
and
would
have
feel
disgrace
to
make
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
to
be
honest
and
poor
be
never
a
Dodson
motto
,
still
less
to
seem
rich
though
be
poor
;
rather
,
the
family
badge
be
to
be
honest
and
rich
,
and
not
only
rich
,
but
rich
than
be
suppose
.
<EOS>
to
live
respected
,
and
have
the
proper
bearer
at
your
funeral
,
be
an
achievement
of
the
end
of
existence
that
would
be
entirely
nullify
if
,
on
the
reading
of
your
will
,
you
sink
in
the
opinion
of
your
fellow
-
man
,
either
by
turn
out
to
be
poor
than
they
expect
,
or
by
leave
your
money
in
a
capricious
manner
,
without
strict
regard
to
degree
of
kin
.
<EOS>
the
right
thing
must
always
be
do
toward
kindre
.
<EOS>
the
right
thing
be
to
correct
them
severely
,
if
they
be
other
than
a
credit
to
the
family
,
but
still
not
to
alienate
from
them
the
small
rightful
share
in
the
family
shoebuckle
and
other
property
.
<EOS>
a
conspicuous
quality
in
the
Dodson
character
be
its
genuineness
;
its
vice
and
virtue
alike
be
phase
of
a
proud
honest
egoism
,
which
have
a
hearty
dislike
to
whatever
make
against
its
own
credit
and
interest
,
and
would
be
frankly
hard
of
speech
to
inconvenient
"
kin
,
"
but
would
never
forsake
or
ignore
them
,
 
would
not
let
them
want
bread
,
but
only
require
them
to
eat
it
with
bitter
herb
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
sort
of
traditional
belief
run
in
the
Tulliver
vein
,
but
it
be
carry
in
rich
blood
,
have
element
of
generous
imprudence
,
warm
affection
,
and
hot
-
tempered
rashness
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
's
grandfather
have
be
hear
to
say
that
he
be
descend
from
one
Ralph
Tulliver
,
a
wonderfully
clever
fellow
,
who
have
ruin
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
likely
enough
that
the
clever
Ralph
be
a
high
liver
,
rode
spirit
horse
,
and
be
very
decidedly
of
his
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
nobody
have
ever
hear
of
a
Dodson
who
have
ruin
himself
;
it
be
not
the
way
of
that
family
.
  
<EOS>
if
such
be
the
view
of
life
on
which
the
Dodsons
and
Tullivers
have
be
rear
in
the
praiseworthy
past
of
Pitt
and
high
price
,
you
will
infer
from
what
you
already
know
concern
the
state
of
society
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
that
there
have
be
no
highly
modifying
influence
to
act
on
them
in
their
maturer
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
possible
,
even
in
that
later
time
of
anti
-
catholic
preaching
,
for
people
to
hold
many
pagan
idea
,
and
believe
themselves
good
church
-
people
,
notwithstanding
;
so
we
need
hardly
feel
any
surprise
at
the
fact
that
Mr.
Tulliver
,
though
a
regular
church
-
goer
,
record
his
vindictiveness
on
the
fly
-
leaf
of
his
Bible
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
any
harm
could
be
say
concern
the
vicar
of
that
charming
rural
parish
to
which
Dorlcote
Mill
belong
;
he
be
a
man
of
excellent
family
,
an
irreproachable
bachelor
,
of
elegant
pursuit
,
 
have
take
honor
,
and
hold
a
fellowship

<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
regard
him
with
dutiful
respect
,
as
he
do
everything
else
belong
to
the
church
-
service
;
but
he
consider
that
church
be
one
thing
and
common
-
sense
another
,
and
he
want
nobody
to
tell
_
him
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
commonsense
be
.
<EOS>
certain
seed
which
be
require
to
find
a
nidus
for
themselves
under
unfavorable
circumstance
have
be
supply
by
nature
with
an
apparatus

so
that
they

get
a

on
very
unreceptive
surface

<EOS>
the
spiritual
seed
which
have
be
scatter
over
Mr.
Tulliver
have
apparently
be
destitute
of
any

provision

slip
off

the

<EOS>
there
be
something
sustain
in
the
very
agitation
that
accompany
the
first
shock
of
trouble
,
just
as
an
acute
pain
be
often
a
stimulus

and
produce
an
excitement
which
be
transient
strength

<EOS>
It
be
in
the
slow

changed
life
that
follow

in
the
time
when
sorrow
have
become
stale

and
have
no

an
emotive
intensity

counteract
its
pain

in
the
time
when
day
follow
day
in
dull
,
unexpectant
sameness

and
trial
be
a
dreary
routine

<EOS>
it
be
then
that
despair

it
be
then
that
the
peremptory
hunger
of
the
soul
be
feel

and
eye

ear
be
strain
after
some
unlearn
secret
of
our
existence

which

give

endurance
the
nature

<EOS>
this
time
of
utmost
need
be
come
to
Maggie

with
her
short
span
of
thirteen
year

<EOS>
to
the
usual
precocity
of
the

she
add
that
early
experience
of
struggle

of
conflict
between
the
inward
impulse
and
outward
fact

which
be
the

strangely
old

prudence

command
which
be
the
quality

Tom
manly

his
intellectual

<EOS>
and
now
her
lot
be
begin
to
have
a
still

sad
monotony

which
throw
her
more
than

on
her
inward
self

<EOS>
Her
father

business
again

his

he

Tom
go
to

fro
every
morning

evening

and
become
more

more
silent
in
the
short
interval
at
home

<EOS>
one

be

Tom

itself
into
the

channel

<EOS>
the
peculiarity

be
very
irksome
to
him

now
they
be
lay

prosaic

<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver

it
seem

would
never

her
old
self

her
placid
household
activity

how
could
she
?
<EOS>
the
object
among
which
her
mind
have
move
complacently
be
all
go

all
the
little
hope

all
the
pleasant

have
be

snatch
away

why

remain
an
insoluble
question
by
which
she
express
her
perpetual
ruminating
comparison
of
the
past
with
the
present
.
<EOS>
It
be
piteous
to
see
the
comely
woman
get
thin
and
more
worn
under
a
bodily
as
well
as
mental
restlessness
,
which
make
her
often
wander
about
the
empty
house
after
her
work
be
do
,
until
Maggie
,
become
alarm
about
her
,
would
seek
her
,
and
bring
her
down
by
tell
her
how
it
vex
Tom
that
she
be
injure
her
health
by
never
sit
down
and
rest
herself
.
<EOS>
yet
amidst
this
helpless
imbecility
there
be
a
touching
trait
of
humble
,
self
-
devote
maternity
,
which
make
Maggie
feel
tenderly
toward
her
poor
mother
amidst
all
the
little
wear
griefs
cause
by
her
mental
feebleness
.
<EOS>
She
would
let
Maggie
do
none
of
the
work
that
be
heavy
and
most
soil
to
the
hand
,
and
be
quite
peevish
when
Maggie
attempt
to
relieve
her
from
her
grate
-
brushing
and
scour
:
"
<EOS>
let
it
alone
,
my
dear
;
your
hand
"
ull
get
as
hard
as
hard
<EOS>
,
"
she
would
say
;
"
it
be
your
mother
's
place
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
the
sewing
 
<EOS>
my
eye
fail
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
would
still
brush
and
carefully
tend
Maggie
's
hair
,
which
she
have
become
reconcile
to
,
in
spite
of
its
refusal
to
curl
<EOS>
,
now
it
be
so
long
and
massy
.
<EOS>
Maggie
be
not
her
pet
child
,
and
,
in
general
,
would
have
be
much
well
if
she
have
be
quite
different
;
yet
the
womanly
heart
,
so
bruise
in
its
small
personal
desire
,
find
a
future
to
rest
on
in
the
life
of
this
young
thing
,
and
the
mother
please
herself
with
wear
out
her
own
hand
to
save
the
hand
that
have
so
much
more
life
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
constant
presence
of
her
mother
's
regretful
bewilderment
be
less
painful
to
Maggie
than
that
of
her
father
's
sullen
,
incommunicative
depression
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
the
paralysis
be
upon
him
,
and
it
seem
as
if
he
may
always
be
in
a
childlike
condition
of
dependence
,
 
as
long
as
he
be
still
only
half
awaken
to
his
trouble
,
 
Maggie
have
feel
the
strong
tide
of
pity
love
almost
as
an
inspiration
,
a
new
power
,
that
would
make
the
most
difficult
life
easy
for
his
sake
;
but
now
,
instead
of
childlike
dependence
,
there
have
come
a
taciturn
,
hard
concentration
of
purpose
,
in
strange
contrast
with
his
old
vehement
communicativeness
and
high
spirit
;
and
this
last
from
day
to
day
,
and
from
week
to
week
,
the
dull
eye
never
brighten
with
any
eagerness
or
any
joy
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
cruelly
incomprehensible
to
youthful
nature
,
this
sombre
sameness
in
middle
-
aged
and
elderly
people
,
whose
life
have
result
in
disappointment
and
discontent
,
to
whose
face
a
smile
become
so
strange
that
the
sad
line
all
about
the
lip
and
brow
seem
to
take
no
notice
of
it
,
and
it
hurry
away
again
for
want
of
a
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
why
will
they
not
kindle
up
and
be
glad
sometimes
?
"
think
young
elasticity
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
easy
if
they
only
like
to
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
these
leaden
cloud
that
never
part
be
apt
to
create
impatience
even
in
the
filial
affection
that
stream
forth
in
nothing
but
tenderness
and
pity
in
the
time
of
more
obvious
affliction

<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
linger
nowhere
away
from
home
;
he
hurry
away
from
market
,
he
refuse
all
invitation
to
stay
and
chat
,
as
in
old
time
,
in
the
house
where
he
call
on
business
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
reconcile
with
his
lot
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
attitude
in
which
his
pride
do
not
feel
its
bruise
;
and
in
all
behavior
toward
him
,
whether
kind
or
cold
,
he
detect
an
allusion
to
the
change
in
his
circumstance
.
<EOS>
even
the
day
on
which
Wakem
come
to
ride
round
the
land
and
inquire
into
the
business
be
not
so
black
to
him
as
those
market
-
day
on
which
he
have
meet
several
creditor
who
have
accept
a
composition
from
him
.
<EOS>
to
save
something
toward
the
repayment
of
those
creditor
be
the
object
toward
which
he
be
now
bend
all
his
thought
and
effort
;
and
under
the
influence
of
this
all
-
compelling
demand
of
his
nature
,
the
somewhat
profuse
man
,
who
hate
to
be
stint
or
to
stint
any
one
else
in
his
own
house
,
be
gradually
metamorphose
into
the
keen
-
eyed
grudger
of
morsel
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
could
not
economize
enough
to
satisfy
him
,
in
their
food
and
firing
;
and
he
would
eat
nothing
himself
but
what
be
of
the
coarse
quality
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
though
depressed
and
strongly
repel
by
his
father
's
sullenness
,
and
the
dreariness
of
home
,
enter
thoroughly
into
his
father
's
feeling
about
pay
the
creditor
;
and
the
poor
lad
bring
his
first
quarter
's
money
,
with
a
delicious
sense
of
achievement
,
and
give
it
to
his
father
to
put
into
the
tin
box
which
hold
the
saving
.
<EOS>
the
little
store
of
sovereign
in
the
tin
box
seem
to
be
the
only
sight
that
bring
a
faint
beam
of
pleasure
into
the
miller
's
eye
,
 
faint
and
transient
,
for
it
be
soon
dispel
by
the
thought
that
the
time
would
be
long
 
perhaps
long
than
his
life
,
 
before
the
narrow
saving
could
remove
the
hateful
incubus
of
debt
.
<EOS>
a
deficit
of
more
than
five
hundred
pound
,
with
the
accumulate
interest
,
seem
a
deep
pit
to
fill
with
the
saving
from
thirty
shilling
a
-
week
,
even
when
Tom
's
probable
saving
be
to
be
add
.
<EOS>
on
this
one
point
there
be
entire
community
of
feeling
in
the
four
widely
differ
being
who
sit
round
the
die
fire
of
stick
,
which
make
a
cheap
warmth
for
them
on
the
verge
of
bedtime

<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
carry
the
proud
integrity
of
the
Dodsons
in
her
blood
,
and
have
be
bring
up
to
think
that
to
wrong
people
of
their
money
,
which
be
another
phrase
for
debt
,
be
a
sort
of
moral
pillory
;
it
would
have
be
wickedness
,
to
her
mind
,
to
have
run
counter
to
her
husband
's
desire
to
"
do
the
right
thing
,
"
and
retrieve
his
name
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
confused
,
dreamy
notion
that
,
if
the
creditor
be
all
pay
,
her
plate
and
linen
ought
to
come
back
to
her
;
but
she
have
an
inbred
perception
that
while
people
owe
money
they
be
unable
to
pay
,
they
could
not
rightly
call
anything
their
own
.
<EOS>
She
murmur
a
little
that
Mr.
Tulliver
so
peremptorily
refuse
to
receive
anything
in
repayment
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Moss
;
but
to
all
his
requirement
of
household
economy
she
be
submissive
to
the
point
of
deny
herself
the
cheap
indulgence
of
mere
flavor
;
her
only
rebellion
be
to
smuggle
into
the
kitchen
something
that
would
make
rather
a
well
supper
than
usual
for
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
these
narrow
notion
about
debt
,
hold
by
the
old
fashioned
Tullivers
,
may
perhaps
excite
a
smile
on
the
face
of
many
reader
in
these
day
of
wide
commercial
view
and
wide
philosophy
,
accord
to
which
everything
right
itself
without
any
trouble
of
ours
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
my
tradesman
be
out
of
pocket
by
me
be
to
be
look
at
through
the
serene
certainty
that
somebody
else
's
tradesman
be
in
pocket
by
somebody
else
;
and
since
there
must
be
bad
debt
in
the
world
,
why
,
it
be
mere
egoism
not
to
like
that
we
in
particular
should
make
them
instead
of
our
fellow
-
citizen
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
the
history
of
very
simple
people
,
who
have
never
have
any
illuminate
doubt
as
to
personal
integrity
and
honor
.
  
<EOS>
under
all
this
grim
melancholy
and
narrow
concentration
of
desire
,
Mr.
Tulliver
retain
the
feeling
toward
his
"
little
wench
"
which
make
her
presence
a
need
to
him
,
though
it
would
not
suffice
to
cheer
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
the
desire
of
his
eye
;
but
the
sweet
spring
of
fatherly
love
be
now
mingle
with
bitterness
,
like
everything
else
.
<EOS>
when
Maggie
lay
down
her
work
at
night
,
it
be
her
habit
to
get
a
low
stool
and
sit
by
her
father
's
knee
,
lean
her
cheek
against
it
.
<EOS>
how
she
wish
he
would
stroke
her
head
,
or
give
some
sign
that
he
be
soothe
by
the
sense
that
he
have
a
daughter
who
love
him
!
<EOS>
but
now
she
get
no
answer
to
her
little
caress
,
either
from
her
father
or
from
Tom
,
 
the
two
idol
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
weary
and
abstract
in
the
short
interval
when
he
be
at
home
,
and
her
father
be
bitterly
preoccupy
with
the
thought
that
the
girl
be
grow
up
,
be
shoot
up
into
a
woman
;
and
how
be
she
to
do
well
in
life
?
<EOS>
She
have
a
poor
chance
for
marrying
,
down
in
the
world
as
they
be
.
<EOS>
and
he
hate
the
thought
of
her
marry
poorly
,
as
her
aunt
Gritty
have
do
;
_
that
_
would
be
a
thing
to
make
him
turn
in
his
grave
,
 
the
little
wench
so
pull
down
by
child
and
toil
,
as
her
aunt

be

<EOS>
when
unculture

confine
to
a
narrow

personal

be
under
the
pressure
of
continue
misfortune
,
their
inward
life
be
apt
to
become
a
perpetually

sad

bitter
thought
;
the

the

scene

be

over

the

mood
accompany
them
;
the
end

find
them
as
much
what
they

at

as
if
they

the

<EOS>
uncle

pay
only
short
visit
now
;
of
course
,
they
could
not
stay
to
meal
,
and
the
constraint
cause
by
Mr.

's
savage
silence

which
seem
to
add
to
the
hollow
resonance
of
the
bare

uncarpeted

when

heighten
the
unpleasantness

these
family
visit
on

side

and
tend
to
make
them
rare

<EOS>
as
for
other
acquaintance
,
there
be
a
chill
air
surround
those
who
be
down
in
the
world
,
and
people
be
glad
to
get
away
from
them

as
from
a
cold

human
being

mere
man

without
furniture

without
anything

who
have
cease

present
an

negation

reason

see
them

or
of
subject

<EOS>
at
that
distant
day

there
be
a
dreary
isolation
in
the
civilized
christian
society
of
these
realm
for
family
that
have
drop
below
their
original
level

unless

a
Voice
from

<EOS>
one
afternoon

when
the
chestnut

,
Maggie
have
bring
her
chair
outside
the
front
door

and
be
seat
there
with
a
book
on
her
knee

<EOS>
Her
dark
eye
have
wander
from

but
they
do
not
seem

enjoy
the
sunshine
which
pierce
the
screen
of
jasmine
on
the
projecting
porch
at
her
right

and
throw
leafy
shadow

pale
round
cheek

they
seem
rather

for
something
that

the
sunshine

<EOS>
It
have
be
a
more
miserable
day
than
usual
;
her
father
,
after
a
visit
of
Wakem

have
have
a
paroxysm
of
rage
,
in
which
for
some
trifling
fault
he
have
beat
the
boy
who
serve
in
the
mill

<EOS>
once
before

he

beat
his
horse

and
the
scene
have
leave
a
lasting
terror
in
Maggie

mind

<EOS>
the
thought
have
rise
,
that
some
time
or
other
he
may
beat
her
mother
if
she
happen
to
speak
in
her
feeble
way
at
the
wrong

the
keenest
of

be
lest
her
father
should
add
to
his

misfortune
the

something
irretrievably
disgraceful

<EOS>
the

again

fill
with
tear

as
they
wander
vaguely
,
see
neither
the
chestnut

only
future
scene

<EOS>
suddenly
she
be
rouse
by

Bob

with
the

have
as
respectful
an
adoration
for

eyed

aloud

away

perhaps
only
make
the
return
gloom
deep
by
contrast

<EOS>
She
be
too
dispirited
even
to
like
answer
question
about
Bob
's
present
of
book
,
and
she
carry
them
away
to
her
bedroom
,
lay
them
down
there
and
seat
herself
on
her
one
stool
,
without
care
to
look
at
them
just
yet
.
<EOS>
She
lean
her
cheek
against
the
window

frame
,
and
think
that
the
light

hearted
Bob
have
a
lot
much
happy
than
her
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
sense
of
loneliness
,
and
utter
privation
of
joy
,
have
deepen
with
the
brightness
of
advance
spring
.
<EOS>
all
the
favorite
outdoor
nook
about
home
,
which
seem
to
have
do
their
part
with
her
parent
in
nurture
and
cherish
her
,
be
now
mix
up
with
the
home

sadness
,
and
gather
no
smile
from
the
sunshine
.
<EOS>
every
affection
,
every
delight
the
poor
child
have
have
,
be
like
an
ache
nerve
to
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
music
for
her
any
more
,
 
no
piano
,
no
harmonize
voice
,
no
delicious
stringed
instrument
,
with
their
passionate
cry
of
imprison
spirit
send
a
strange
vibration
through
her
frame
.
<EOS>
and
of
all
her
school
-
life
there
be
nothing
leave
her
now
<EOS>
but
her
little
collection
of
school
-
book
,
which
she
turn
over
with
a
sickening
sense
that
she
know
them
all
,
and
they
be
all
barren
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
even
at
school
she
have
often
wish
for
book
with
_
more
_
in
them
;
everything
she
learn
there
seem
like
the
end
of
long
thread
that
snap
immediately
.
<EOS>
and
now
 
without
the
indirect
charm
of
school
-
emulation
 
Télémaque
be
mere
bran
;
so
be
the
hard
,
dry
question
on
Christian
Doctrine
;
there
be
no
flavor
in
them
,
no
strength
.
<EOS>
sometimes
Maggie
think
she
could
have
be
content
with
absorb
fancy
;
if
she
could
have
have
all
Scott
's
novel
and
all
Byron
's
poem
!
 
<EOS>
then
,
perhaps
,
she
may
have
find
happiness
enough
to
dull
her
sensibility
to
her
actual
daily
life
.
<EOS>
and
yet
they
be
hardly
what
she
want
.
<EOS>
She
could
make
dream
-
world
of
her
own
,
but
no
dream
-
world
would
satisfy
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
want
some
explanation
of
this
hard
,
real
life
,
 
the
unhappy
-
look
father
,
seat
at
the
dull
breakfast

table
;
the
childish
,
bewildered
mother
;
the
little
sordid
task
that
fill
the
hour
,
or
the
more
oppressive
emptiness
of
weary
,
joyless
leisure
;
the
need
of
some
tender
,
demonstrative
love
;
the
cruel
sense
that
Tom
do
not
mind
what
she
think
or
feel
,
and
that
they
be
no
longer
playfellow
together
;
the
privation
of
all
pleasant
thing
that
have
come
to
_
her
_
more
than
to
other
,
 
she
want
some
key
that
would
enable
her
to
understand
,
and
in
understanding
,
to
endure
,
the
heavy
weight
that
have
fall
on
her
young
heart
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
teach
"
real
learning
and
wisdom
,
such
as
great
man
know
,
"
she
think
she
should
have
hold
the
secret
of
life
;
if
she
have
only
book
,
that
she
may
learn
for
herself
what
wise
man
know
!
<EOS>
saint
and
martyr
have
never
interest
Maggie
so
much
as
sage
and
poet
.
<EOS>
She
know
little
of
saint
and
martyr
,
and
have
gather
,
as
a
general
result
of
her
teaching
,
that
they
be
a
temporary
provision
against
the
spread
of
Catholicism
,
and
have
all
die
at
Smithfield
.
  
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
meditation
it
occur
to
her
that
she
have
forget
Tom
's
school
-
book
,
which
have
be
send
home
in
his
trunk
.
<EOS>
but
she
find
the
stock
unaccountably
shrink
down
to
the
few
old
one
which
have
be
well
thumb
,
 
the
Latin
Dictionary
and
Grammar
,
a
Delectus
,
a
torn
Eutropius
,
the
well
-
wear
Virgil
,
Aldrich
's
Logic
,
and
the
exasperate
Euclid
.
<EOS>
still
,
Latin
,
euclid
,
and
logic
would
surely
be
a
considerable
step
in
masculine
wisdom
,
 
in
that
knowledge
which
make
man
content
,
and
even
glad
to
live
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
yearning
for
effectual
wisdom
be
quite
unmixed
;
a
certain
mirage
would
now
and
then
rise
on
the
desert
of
the
future
,
in
which
she
seem
to
see
herself
honor
for
her
surprising
attainment
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
poor
child
,
with
her
soul
's
hunger
and
her
illusion
of
self
-
flattery
,
begin
to
nibble
at
this
thick
-
rinde
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
,
fill
her
vacant
hour
with
Latin
,
geometry
,
and
the
form
of
the
syllogism
,
and
feel
a
gleam
of
triumph
now
and
then
that
her
understanding
be
quite
equal
to
these
peculiarly
masculine
study
.
<EOS>
for
a
week
or
two
she
go
on
resolutely
enough
,
though
with
an
occasional
sinking
of
heart
,
as
if
she
have
set
out
toward
the
promise
Land
alone
,
and
find
it
a
thirsty
,
trackless
,
uncertain
journey
.
<EOS>
in
the
severity
of
her
early
resolution
,
she
would
take
Aldrich
out
into
the
field
,
and
then
look
off
her
book
toward
the
sky
,
where
the
lark
be
twinkle
,
or
to
the
reed
and
bush
by
the
river
,
from
which
the
waterfowl
rustle
forth
on
its
anxious
,
awkward
flight
,
 
with
a
startled
sense
that
the
relation
between
Aldrich
and
this
live
world
be
extremely
remote
for
her
.
<EOS>
the
discouragement
deepen
as
the
day
go
on
,
and
the
eager
heart
gain
faster
and
faster
on
the
patient
mind
.
<EOS>
somehow
,
when
she
sit
at
the
window
with
her
book
,
her
eye
_
would
_
fix
themselves
blankly
on
the
outdoor
sunshine
;
then
they
would
fill
with
tear
,
and
sometimes
,
if
her
mother
be
not
in
the
room
,
the
study
would
all
end
in
sob
.
<EOS>
She
rebel
against
her
lot
,
she
faint
under
its
loneliness
,
and
fit
even
of
anger
and
hatred
toward
her
father
and
mother
,
who
be
so
unlike
what
she
would
have
them
to
be
;
toward
Tom
,
who
check
her
,
and
meet
her
thought
or
feeling
always
by
some
thwart
difference
,
 
would
flow
out
over
her
affection
and
conscience
like
a
lava
stream
,
and
frighten
her
with
a
sense
that
it
be
not
difficult
for
her
to
become
a
demon
.
<EOS>
then
her
brain
would
be
busy
with
wild
romance
of
a
flight
from
home
in
search
of
something
less
sordid
and
dreary
;
she
would
go
to
some
great
man
 
Walter
Scott
,
perhaps
 
and
tell
him
how
wretched
and
how
clever
she
be
,
and
he
would
surely
do
something
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
middle
of
her
vision
,
her
father
would
perhaps
enter
the
room
for
the
evening
,
and
,
surprise
that
she
sit
still
without
notice
him
,
would
say
complainingly
,
"
come
,
be
I
to
fetch
my
slipper
myself
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
voice
pierce
through
Maggie
like
a
sword
;
there
be
another
sadness
besides
her
own
,
and
she
have
be
think
of
turn
her
back
on
it
and
forsake
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
afternoon
,
the
sight
of
Bob
's
cheerful
freckle
face
have
give
her
discontent
a
new
direction
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
be
part
of
the
hardship
of
her
life
that
there
be
lay
upon
her
the
burthen
of
large
want
than
other
seem
to
feel
,
 
that
she
have
to
endure
this
wide
,
hopeless
yearning
for
that
something
,
whatever
it
be
,
that
be
great
and
good
on
this
earth
.
<EOS>
She
wish
she
could
have
be
like
Bob
,
with
his
easily
satisfied
ignorance
,
or
like
Tom
,
who
have
something
to
do
on
which
he
could
fix
his
mind
with
a
steady
purpose
,
and
disregard
everything
else
.
<EOS>
poor
child
!
<EOS>
as
she
lean
her
head
against
the
window
-
frame
,
with
her
hand
clasp
tight
and
tight
,
and
her
foot
beat
the
ground
,
she
be
as
lonely
in
her
trouble
as
if
she
have
be
the
only
girl
in
the
civilized
world
of
that
day
who
have
come
out
of
her
school
-
life
with
a
soul
untraine
for
inevitable
struggle
,
with
no
other
part
of
her
inherit
share
in
the
hard
-
win
treasure
of
thought
which
generation
of
painful
toil
have
lay
up
for
the
race
of
man
,
than
shred
and
patch
of
feeble
literature
and
false
history
,
with
much
futile
information
about
Saxon
and
other
king
of
doubtful
example
,
but
unhappily
quite
without
that
knowledge
of
the
irreversible
law
within
and
without
her
,
which
,
govern
the
habit
,
become
morality
,
and
develop
the
feeling
of
submission
and
dependence
,
become
religion
,
 
as
lonely
in
her
trouble
as
if
every
other
girl
besides
herself
have
be
cherish
and
watch
over
by
eld
mind
,
not
forgetful
of
their
own
early
time
,
when
need
be
keen
and
impulse
strong
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Maggie
's
eye
glance
down
on
the
book
that
lie
on
the
window
-
shelf
,
and
she
half
forsake
her
reverie
to
turn
over
listlessly
the
leave
of
the
"
Portrait
Gallery

but
she
soon
push
this

know
the

be
inside
all
these
;
the

"
 
that
seem
to
be
a
hymnbook
,
and
she
lay
it
down
again
;
but
_
Thomas

?
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
the
name
have
come
across
her
in
her
reading
,
and
she
feel
the
satisfaction
,
which
every
one
know
,
of
get
some
idea
to
attach
to
a
name
that
stray
solitary
in
the
memory

<EOS>
She
take
up
the
little
,
old
,
clumsy
book
with
some
curiosity
;
it
have
the
corner
turn
down
in
many

some

forever
quiet

have
make
at
certain
passage
strong
pen

and
-

mark
,
long
since
brown

<EOS>
Maggie
turn
from
leaf
to
leaf
,
and
read
where
the
quiet
hand
point
:
"
know
that
the
love

thee

thou

never

everywhere
of

thou

patience

if
thou
wilt
have
inward
peace

and
enjoy
an
everlasting
crown

<EOS>
if
thou
desir
to

unto

thou
must
set
out
courageously
,
and
lie
the
axe
to
the
root

thou

pluck
up

inordinately

almost
all

so
grievously

therefore
to

the
more
heavy

thou

thy

<EOS>
a
strange
thrill
of
awe
pass
through
Maggie
while
she
read
,
as
if
she
have
be
waken
in
the
night
by
a
strain
of
solemn
music
,
tell
of
being
whose
soul
have
be
astir
while
hers
be
in
stupor

<EOS>
She
go
on
from
one
brown
mark
to
another
,
where
the
quiet
hand
seem
to
point
,
hardly
conscious
that
she
be
read
,
seem
rather
to
listen
while
a
low
voice
say
;
  
"
<EOS>
why
dost
thou
here
gaze
about
,
since
this

not
the

thou
together

<EOS>
beware
thou

<EOS>
if
a

should
give

<EOS>
Maggie
draw
a
long
breath
and
push
her
heavy
hair
back
,
as
if
to
see
a
sudden
vision
more
clearly
.
<EOS>
here
,
then
,
be
a
secret
of
life
that
would
enable
her
to
renounce
all
other
secret
;
here
be
a
sublime
height
to
be
reach
without
the
help
of
outward
thing
;
here
be
insight
,
and
strength
,
and
conquest
,
to
be
win
by
mean
entirely
within
her
own
soul
,
where
a
supreme
Teacher
be
wait
to
be
hear
.
<EOS>
It
flash
through
her
like
the
suddenly
apprehend
solution
of
a
problem
,
that
all
the
misery
of
her
young
life
have
come
from
fix
her
heart
on
her
own
pleasure
,
as
if
that
be
the
central
necessity
of
the
universe
;
and
for
the
first
time
she
see
the
possibility
of
shift
the
position
from
which
she
look
at
the
gratification
of
her
own
desire
,
 
of
take
her
stand
out
of
herself
,
and
look
at
her
own
life
as
an
insignificant
part
of
a
divinely
guide
whole
.
<EOS>
She
read
on
and
on
in
the
old
book
,
devour
eagerly
the
dialogue
with
the
invisible
teacher
,
the
pattern
of
sorrow
,
the
source
of
all
strength
;
return
to
it
after
she
have
be
call
away
,
and
read
till
the
sun
go
down
behind
the
willow
.
<EOS>
with
all
the
hurry
of
an
imagination
that
could
never
rest
in
the
present
,
she
sit
in
the
deepen
twilight
form
plan
of
self
-
humiliation
and
entire
devotedness
;
and
in
the
ardor
of
first
discovery
,
renunciation
seem
to
her
the
entrance
into
that
satisfaction
which
she
have
so
long
be
crave
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
perceive
 
how
could
she
until
she
have
live
longer
?
 
<EOS>
the
inmost
truth
of
the
old
monk
's
out
-
pouring
,
that
renunciation
remain
sorrow
,
though
a
sorrow
borne
willingly
.
<EOS>
Maggie
be
still
pant
for
happiness
,
and
be
in
ecstasy
because
she
have
find
the
key
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
know
nothing
of
doctrine
and
system
,
of
mysticism
or
quietism
;
but
this
voice
out
of
the
far
-
off
middle
age
be
the
direct
communication
of
a
human
soul
's
belief
and
experience
,
and
come
to
Maggie
as
an
unquestioned
message
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
be
the
reason
why
the
small
old
-
fashioned
book
,
for
which
you
need
only
pay
sixpence
at
a
book
-
stall
,
work
miracle
to
this
day
,
turn
bitter
water
into
sweetness
;
while
expensive
sermon
and
treatise
,
newly
issue
,
leave
all
thing
as
they
be
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
write
down
by
a
hand
that
wait
for
the
heart
's
prompting
;
it
be
the
chronicle
of
a
solitary
,
hide
anguish
,
struggle
,
trust
,
and
triumph
,
not
write
on
velvet
cushion
to
teach
endurance
to
those
who
be
tread
with
bleed
foot
on
the
stone
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
remain
to
all
time
a
last
record
of
human
need
and
human
consolation
;
the
voice
of
a
brother
who
,
age
ago
,
feel
and
suffer
and
renounce
,
 
in
the
cloister
,
perhaps
,
with
serge
gown
and
tonsured
head
,
with
much
chant
and
long
fast
,
and
with
a
fashion
of
speech
different
from
our
,
 
but
under
the
same
silent
far
-
off
heavens
,
and
with
the
same
passionate
desire
,
the
same
striving
,
the
same
failure
,
the
same

<EOS>
in
write
the
history
of
unfashionable
family
,
one
be
apt
to
fall
into
a
tone
of
emphasis
which
be
very
far
from
be
the
tone
of
good
society
,
where
principle
and
belief
be
not
only
of
an
extremely
moderate
kind
,
but
be
always
presuppose
,
no
subject
be
eligible
but
such
as
can
be
touch
with
a
light
and
graceful
irony
.
<EOS>
but
then
good
society
have
its
claret
and
its
velvet
carpet
,
its
dinner
-
engagement
<EOS>
six
week
deep
,
its
opera
and
its
faëry
ball

room
;
ride
off
its
_

_
on
thoroughbred
horse
;
lounge
at
the
club

have
to
keep
clear
of
crinoline

get
its
science
do
by
Faraday

and
its
religion
by
the
superior
clergy
who
be
to
be
meet
in
the
good
house
,
 
how
should
it
have
time
or
need
for
belief
and
emphasis
?
<EOS>
but
good
society
,
float
on
gossamer
wing
of
light
irony
,
be
of
very
expensive
production
;
require
nothing
less
than
a
wide
and
arduous
national
life
condense
in
unfragrant
deafening
factory
,
cramp
itself
in
mine
,
sweat
at
furnace
,
grinding
,
hammering
,
weave
under
more

less
oppression
of
carbonic
acid

or
else
,
spread
over

and
scatter
in
lonely
house
and
hut
on
the
clayey
or
chalky
corn
-
land
,
where
the
rainy
day
look
dreary
.
<EOS>
this
wide
national
life
be
base
entirely
on
emphasis
,
 
the
emphasis
of
want
,
which
urge
it
into
all
the
activity
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
good
society
and
light
irony
;
it
spend
its
heavy
year
often
in
a
chill
,
uncarpeted
fashion
,
amidst
family
discord
unsoftene
by
long
corridor
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
there
be
many
among
its
myriad
of
soul
who
have
absolutely
need
an
emphatic
belief
,
life
in
this
unpleasurable
shape
demand
some
solution
even
to
unspeculative
mind
,
 
just
as
you
inquire
into
the
stuffing
of
your
couch
when
anything
gall
you
there
,
whereas
eider
-
down
and
perfect
french
spring
excite
no
question
.
<EOS>
some
have
an
emphatic
belief
in
alcohol
,
and
seek
their
_
ekstasis
_
or
outside
standing
-
ground
in
gin
;
but
the
rest
require
something
that
good
society
call
"
enthusiasm
,
"
something
that
will
present
motive
in
an
entire
absence
of
high
prize
;
something
that
will
give
patience
and
feed
human
love
when
the
limb
ache
with
weariness
,
and
human
look
be
hard
upon
us
;
something
,
clearly
,
that
lie
outside
personal
desire
,
that
include
resignation
for
ourselves
and
active
love
for
what
be
not
ourselves
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
that
sort
of
enthusiasm
find
a
far
-
echo
voice
that
come
from
an
experience
spring
out
of
the
deep
need
;
and
it
be
by
be
bring
within
the
long
linger
vibration
of
such
a
voice
that
Maggie
,
with
her
girl
's
face
and
unnoted
sorrow
,
find
an
effort
and
a
hope
that
help
her
through
year
of
loneliness
,
make
out
a
faith
for
herself
without
the
aid
of
establish
authority
and
appoint
guide
;
for
they
be
not
at
hand
,
and
her
need
be
press
.
<EOS>
from
what
you
know
of
her
,
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
she
throw
some
exaggeration
and
wilfulness
,
some
pride
and
impetuosity
,
even
into
her
self
-
renunciation
;
her
own
life
be
still
a
drama
for
her
,
in
which
she
demand
of
herself
that
her
part
should
be
play
with
intensity
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
come
to
pass
that
she
often
lose
the
spirit
of
humility
by
be
excessive
in
the
outward
act
;
she
often
strove
after
too
high
a
flight
,
and
come
down
with
her
poor
little
half
-
fledge
wing
dabble
in
the
mud
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
she
not
only
determine
to
work
at
plain
sewing
,
that
she
may
contribute
something
toward
the
fund
in
the
tin
box
,
but
she
go
,
in
the
first
instance
,
in
her
zeal
of
self
-
mortification
,
to
ask
for
it
at
a
linen
shop
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
instead
of
get
it
in
a
more
quiet
and
indirect
way
;
and
could
see
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
entirely
wrong
and
unkind
,
nay
,
persecuting
,
in
Tom
's
reproof
of
her
for
this
unnecessary
act
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
_
my
_
sister
to
do
such
thing
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
_
<EOS>
I
will
_
take
care
that
the
debt
be
pay
,
without
your
lower
yourself
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
surely
there
be
some
tenderness
and
bravery
mingle
with
the
worldliness
and
self
-
assertion
of
that
little
speech
;
but
Maggie
hold
it
as
dross
,
overlook
the
grain
of
gold
,
and
take
Tom
's
rebuke
as
one
of
her
outward
crosse
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
very
hard
to
her
,
she
use
to
think
,
in
her
long
night
-
watching
,
 
to
her
who
have
always
love
him
so
;
and
then
she
strove
to
be
content
with
that
hardness
,
and
to
require
nothing
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
path
we
all
like
when
we
set
out
on
our
abandonment
of
egoism
,
 
the
path
of
martyrdom
and
endurance
,
where
the
palm
-
branch
grow
,
rather
than
the
steep
highway
of
tolerance
,
just
allowance
,
and
self
-
blame
,
where
there
be
no
leafy
honor
to
be
gather
and
wear
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
book
,
Virgil
,
Euclid
,
and
Aldrich
 
that
wrinkle
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
 
have
be
all
lay
by
;
for
Maggie
have
turn
her
back
on
the
vain
ambition
to
share
the
thought
of
the
wise
.
<EOS>
in
her
first
ardor
she
fling
away
the
book
with
a
sort
of
triumph
that
she
have
rise
above
the
need
of
them
;
and
if
they
have
be
her
own
,
she
would
have
burn
them
,
believe
that
she
would
never
repent
.
<EOS>
She
read
so
eagerly
and
constantly
in
her
three
book
,
the
Bible
,
Thomas
à
Kempis
,
and
the
"
Christian
Year
"
(
no
longer
reject
as
a
"
hymn
-
book
"
)
,
that
they
fill
her
mind
with
a
continual
stream
of
rhythmic
memory
;
and
she
be
too
ardently
learn
to
see
all
nature
and
life
in
the
light
of
her
new
faith
,
to
need
any
other
material
for
her
mind
to
work
on
,
as
she
sit
with
her
well
-
ply
needle
,
make
shirt
and
other
complicated
stitching
,
falsely
call
"
plain
,
"
 
by
no
mean
plain
to
Maggie
,
since
wristband
and
sleeve
and
the
like
have
a
capability
of
be
sew
in
wrong
side
outward
in
moment
of
mental
wandering
.
  
<EOS>
hang
diligently
over
her
sewing
,
Maggie
be
a
sight
any
one
may
have
be
pleased
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
that
new
inward
life
of
hers
,
notwithstanding
some
volcanic
upheaving
of
imprisoned
passion
,
yet
shine
out
in
her
face
with
a
tender
soft
light
that
mingle
itself
as
add
loveliness
with
the
gradually
enrich
color
and
outline
of
her
blossom
youth
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
feel
the
change
in
her
with
a
sort
of
puzzle
wonder
that
Maggie
should
be
"
grow
up
so
good
"
;
it
be
amazing
that
this
once
"
contrairy
"
child
be
become
so
submissive
,
so
backward
to
assert
her
own
will
.
<EOS>
Maggie
use
to
look
up
from
her
work
and
find
her
mother
's
eye
fix
upon
her
;
they
be
watch
and
wait
for
the
large
young
glance
,
as
if
her
elder
frame
get
some
needful
warmth
from
it
.
<EOS>
the
mother
be
get
fond
of
her
tall
,
brown
girl
,
 
the
only
bit
of
furniture
now
on
which
she
could
bestow
her
anxiety
and
pride
;
and
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
her
own
ascetic
wish
to
have
no
personal
adornment
,
be
oblige
to
give
way
to
her
mother
about
her
hair
,
and
submit
to
have
the
abundant
black
lock
plait
into
a
coronet
on
the
summit
of
her
head
,
after
the
pitiable
fashion
of
those
antiquated

<EOS>
"
let
your
mother
have
that
bit
<EOS>
o

pleasure
,
my

"
say
Mrs.
Tulliver
;
"
I
would
trouble
enough
with
your
hair
once

"
  
<EOS>
so
Maggie
,
glad
of
anything
that
would
soothe
her
mother
,
and
cheer
their
long
day
together
,
consent
to
the
vain
decoration
,
and
show
a
queenly
head
above
her
old
frock
,
steadily
refuse
,
however
,
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
like
to
call
the
father
's
attention
to
Maggie
's
hair
and
other
unexpected
virtue
,
but
he
have
a
brusk
reply
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
well
enough
what
she
would
be
,
before
now
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
nothing
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
pity
<EOS>
she
be
not
make
o

commoner
stuff

she
will
be
throw
away
,
I
doubt
,
 
there
will
be
nobody
to
marry
her
as
be
fit
for
her

"
  
<EOS>
and
Maggie
's
grace
of
mind
and
body
feed
his
gloom
.
<EOS>
He
sit
patiently
enough
while
she
read
him
a
chapter
,
or
say
something
timidly
when
they
be
alone
together
about
trouble
be
turn
into
a
blessing

<EOS>
He
take
it
all
as
part
of
his
daughter
's
goodness
,
which
make
his
misfortune
the
sadder
to
him
because
they
damage
her
chance
in

<EOS>
in
a
mind
charge
with
an
eager
purpose
and
an
unsatisfied
vindictiveness
,
there
be
no
room
for
new
feeling
;
Mr.

do
not
want
spiritual
consolation
 
<EOS>
he
want
to
shake
off
the
degradation
of

along

<EOS>
Maggie

sit

against

enter
the

as
usual

on

not

<EOS>
some

a

on

<EOS>
Maggie
have
hardly
time
to
feel
that
it
be
Philip
come
back
,
before
they
be
in
front
of
the
window
,
and
he
be
raise
his
hat
to
her
;
while
his
father
,
catch
the
movement
by
a
side
-
glance
,
look
sharply
round
at
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
hurry
away
from
the
window
and
carry
her
work
upstairs
;
for
Mr.
Wakem
sometimes
come
in
and
inspect
the
book
,
and
Maggie
feel
that
the
meeting
with
Philip
would
be
rob
of
all
pleasure
in
the
presence
of
the
two
father
.
<EOS>
some
day
,
perhaps
,
she
could
see
him
when
they
could
just
shake
hand
,
and
she
could
tell
him
that
she
remember
his
goodness
to
Tom
,
and
the
thing
he
have
say
to
her
in
the
old
day
,
though
they
could
never
be
friend
any
more
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
at
all
agitate
to
Maggie
to
see
Philip
again
;
she
retain
her
childish
gratitude
and
pity
toward
him
,
and
remember
his
cleverness
;
and
in
the
early
week
of
her
loneliness
she
have
continually
recall
the
image
of
him
among
the
people
who
have
be
kind
to
her
in
life
,
often
wish
she
have
him
for
a
brother
and
a
teacher
,
as
they
have
fancy
it
may
have
be
,
in
their
talk
together
.
<EOS>
but
that
sort
of
wishing
have
be
banish
along
with
other
dream
that
savor
of
seek
her
own
will
;
and
she
think
,
besides
,
that
Philip
may
be
alter
by
his
life
abroad
,
 
he
may
have
become
worldly
,
and
really
not
care
about
her
say
anything
to
him
now
.
<EOS>
and
yet
his
face
be
wonderfully
little
alter
,
 
it
be
only
a
large
,
more
manly
copy
of
the
pale
,
small
-
feature
boy
's
face
,
with
the
gray
eye
,
and
the
boyish
wave
brown
hair
;
there
be
the
old
deformity
to
awaken
the
old
pity
;
and
after
all
her
meditation
,
Maggie
feel
that
she
really
_
should
_
like
to
say
a
few
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
still
be
melancholy
,
as
he
always
use
to
be
,
and
like
her
to
look
at
him
kindly
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
if
he
remember
how
he
use
to
like
her
eye
;
with
that
thought
Maggie
glance
toward
the
square
looking
-
glass
which
be
condemn
to
hang
with
its
face
toward
the
wall
,
and
she
half
start
from
her
seat
to
reach
it
down
;
but
she
check
herself
and
snatch
up
her
work
,
try
to
repress
the
rise
wish
by
force
her
memory
to
recall
snatch
of
hymn
,
until
she
see
Philip
and
his
father
return
along
the
road
,
and
she
could
go
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
far
on
in
June
now
,
and
Maggie
be
inclined
to
lengthen
the
daily
walk
which
be
her
one
indulgence
;
but
this
day
and
the
following
she
be
so
busy
with
work
which
must
be
finish
that
she
never
go
beyond
the
gate
,
and
satisfy
her
need
of
the
open
air
by
sit
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
one
of
her
frequent
walk
,
when
she
be
not
oblige
to
go
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
be
to
a
spot
that
lie
beyond
what
be
call
the
"
Hill
,
"
 
an
insignificant
rise
of
ground
crown
by
tree
,
lie
along
the
side
of
the
road
which
run
by
the
gate
of
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
insignificant
I
call
it
,
because
in
height
it
be
hardly
more
than
a
bank
;
but
there
may
come
moment
when
Nature
make
a
mere
bank
a
means
toward
a
fateful
result
;
and
that
be
why
I
ask
you
to
imagine
this
high
bank
crown
with
tree
,
make
an
uneven
wall
for
some
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
left
side
of
Dorlcote
Mill
and
<EOS>
the
pleasant
field
behind
it
,
bound
by
the
murmur
Ripple
.
<EOS>
just
where
this
line
of
bank
slope
down
again
to
the
level
,
a
by
-
road
turn
off
and
lead
to
the
other
side
of
the
rise
,
where
it
be
break
into
very
capricious
hollow
and
mound
by
the
working
of
an
exhausted
stone
-
quarry
,
so
long
exhausted
that
both
mound
and
hollow
be
now
clothe
with
bramble
and
tree
,
and
here
and
there
by
a
stretch
of
grass
which
a
few
sheep
keep
close
-
nibbled
.
<EOS>
in
her
childish
day
Maggie
hold
this
place
,
call
the
Red
Deeps
,
in
very
great
awe
,
and
need
all
her
confidence
in
Tom
's
bravery
to
reconcile
her
to
an
excursion
thither
,
 
vision
of
robber
and
fierce
animal
haunt
every
hollow
.
<EOS>
but
now
it
have
the
charm
for
her
which
any
broken
ground
,
any
mimic
rock
and
ravine
,
have
for
the
eye
that
rest
habitually
on
the
level
;
especially
in
summer
,
when
she
could
sit
on
a
grassy
hollow
under
the
shadow
of
a
branching
ash
,
stoop
aslant
from
the
steep
above
her
,
and
listen
to
the
hum
of
insect
,
like
tiny
bell
on
the
garment
of
Silence
,
or
see
the
sunlight
pierce
the
distant
bough
,
as
if
to
chase
and
drive
home
the
truant
heavenly
blue
of
the
wild
hyacinth
.
<EOS>
in
this
June
time
,
too
,
the
dog
-
rose
be
in
their
glory
,
and
that
be
an
additional
reason
why
Maggie
should
direct
her
walk
to
the
Red
Deeps
,
rather
than
to
any
other
spot
,
<EOS>
on
the
first
day
she
be
free
to
wander
at
her
will
,
 
a
pleasure
she
love
so
well
,
that
sometimes
,
in
her
ardor
of
renunciation
,
she
think
she
ought
to
deny
herself
the
frequent
indulgence
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
see
her
now
,
as
she
walk
down
the
favorite
turning
and
enter
the
deep
by
a
narrow
path
through
a
group
of
Scotch
fir
,
her
tall
figure
and
old
lavender
gown
visible
through
an
hereditary
black
silk
shawl
of
some
wide
-
mesh
net
-
like
material
;
and
now
she
be
sure
of
be
unseen
<EOS>
she
take
off
her
bonnet
and
tie
it
over
her
arm
.
<EOS>
one
would
certainly
suppose
her
to
be
farther
on
in
life
than
her
seventeenth
year
 
perhaps
because
of
the
slow
resign
sadness
of
the
glance
from
which
all
search
and
unrest
seem
to
have
depart
;
perhaps
because
her
broad
-
cheste
figure
have
the
mould
of
early
womanhood
.
<EOS>
youth
and
health
have
withstand
well
the
involuntary
and
voluntary
hardship
of
her
lot
,
and
the
night
in
which
she
have
lain
on
the
hard
floor
for
a
penance
have
leave
no
obvious
trace
;
the
eye
be
liquid
,
the
brown
cheek
be
firm
and
round
,
the
full
lip
be
red
.
<EOS>
with
her
dark
coloring
and
jet
crown
surmount
her
tall
figure
,
she
seem
to
have
a
sort
of
kinship
with
the
grand
Scotch
fir
,
at
which
she
be
look
up
as
if
she
love
them
well
.
<EOS>
yet
one
have
a
sense
of
uneasiness
in
look
at
her
,
 
a
sense
of
oppose
element
,
of
which
a
fierce
collision
be
imminent
;
surely
there
be
a
hushed
expression
,
such
as
one
often
see
in
old
face
under
borderless
cap
,
<EOS>
out
of
keep
with
the
resistant
youth
,
which
one
expect
to
flash
out
in
a
sudden
,
passionate
glance
,
that
will
dissipate
all
the
quietude
,
like
a
damp
fire
leap
out
again
when
all
seem
safe
.
  
<EOS>
but
Maggie
herself
be
not
uneasy
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
She
be
calmly
enjoy
the
free
air
,
while
she
look
up
at
the
old
fir
-
tree
,
and
think
that
those
broken
end
of
branch
be
the
record
of
past
storm
,
which
have
only
make
the
red
stem
soar
high
.
<EOS>
but
while
her
eye
be
still
turn
upward
,
she
become
conscious
of
a
move
shadow
cast
by
the
evening
sun
on
the
grassy
path
before
her
,
and
look
down
with
a
startled
gesture
to
see
Philip
Wakem
,
who
first
raise
his
hat
,
and
then
,
blush
deeply
,
come
forward
to
her
and
put
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
too
,
color
with
surprise
,
which
soon
give
way
to
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
and
look
down
at
the
deform
figure
before
her
with
frank
eye
,
fill
for
the
moment
with
nothing
but
the
memory
of
her
child
's
feeling
,
 
a
memory
that
be
always
strong
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
startle
me
,
"
she
say
,
smile
faintly
;
"
I
never
meet
any
one
here
.
<EOS>
how
come
you
to
be
walk
here
?
<EOS>
do
you
come
to
meet
_
me
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
not
to
perceive
that
Maggie
feel
herself
a
child
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
,
"
say
Philip
,
still
embarrassed
;
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
see
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
watch
a
long
while
yesterday
on
the
bank
near
your
house
to
see
if
you
would
come
out
,
but
you
never
come
.
<EOS>
then
I
watch
again
to
-
day
,
and
when
I
see
the
way
you
take
,
I
keep
you
in
sight
and
come
down
the
bank
,
behind
there
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
be
displeased
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Maggie
,
with
simple
seriousness
,
walk
on
as
if
she
mean
Philip
to
accompany
her
,
"
I
be
very
glad
you
come
,
for
I
wish
very
much
to
have
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
forget
how
good
you
be
long
ago
to
Tom
,
and
me
too
;
but
I
be
not
sure
that
you
would
remember
us
so
well
.
<EOS>
Tom
and
I
have
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
since
then
,
and
I
think
_
that
_
make
one
think
more
of
what
happen
before
the
trouble
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
that
you
have
think
of
me
so
much
as
I
have
think
of
you
,
"
say
Philip
,
timidly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
when
I
be
away
,
I
make
a
picture
of
you
as
you
look
that
morning
in
the
study
when
you
say
you
would
not
forget
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
draw
a
large
miniature
-
case
from
his
pocket
,
and
open
it
.
<EOS>
Maggie
see
her
old
self
lean
on
a
table
,
with
her
black
lock
hang
down
behind
her
ear
,
look
into
space
,
with
strange
,
dreamy
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
water
-
color
sketch
,
of
real
merit
as
a
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
"
say
Maggie
,
smile
,
and
flush
with
pleasure
,
"
what
a
queer
little
girl
I
be
!
<EOS>
I
remember
myself
with
my
hair
in
that
way
,
in
that
pink
frock
.
<EOS>
I
really
_
be
_
like
a
gypsy
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
be
now
,
"
she
add
,
after
a
little
pause
;
"
be
I
like
what
you
expect
me
to
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
may
have
be
those
of
a
coquette
,
but
the
full
,
bright
glance
Maggie
turn
on
Philip
be
not
that
of
a
coquette
.
<EOS>
She
really
do
hope
he
like
her
face
as
it
be
now
,
but
it
be
simply
the
rise
again
of
her
innate
delight
in
admiration
and
love
.
<EOS>
Philip
meet
her
eye
and
look
at
her
in
silence
for
a
long
moment
,
before
he
say
quietly
,
"
no
,
Maggie
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
light
die
out
a
little
from
Maggie
's
face
,
and
there
be
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lip
.
<EOS>
Her
eyelid
fall
lower
,
but
she
do
not
turn
away
her
head
,
and
Philip
continue
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
slowly
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
much
more
beautiful
than
I
think
you
would
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
?
"
<EOS>
say
Maggie
,
the
pleasure
return
in
a
deep
flush
.
<EOS>
She
turn
her
face
away
from
him
and
take
some
step
,
look
straight
before
her
in
silence
,
as
if
she
be
adjust
her
consciousness
to
this
new
idea
.
<EOS>
girl
be
so
accustomed
to
think
of
dress
as
the
main
ground
of
vanity
,
that
,
in
abstain
from
the
looking
-
glass
,
Maggie
have
think
more
of
abandon
all
care
for
adornment
than
of
renounce
the
contemplation
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
compare
herself
with
elegant
,
wealthy
young
lady
,
it
have
not
occur
to
her
that
she
could
produce
any
effect
with
her
person
.
<EOS>
Philip
seem
to
like
the
silence
well
.
<EOS>
He
walk
by
her
side
,
watch
her
face
,
as
if
that
sight
leave
no
room
for
any
other
wish
.
<EOS>
They
have
pass
from
among
the
fir
-
tree
,
and
have
now
come
to
a
green
hollow
almost
surround
by
an
amphitheatre
of
the
pale
pink
dog
-
rose
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
light
about
them
have
brighten
,
Maggie
's
face
have
lose
its
glow
.
  
<EOS>
She
stand
still
when
they
be
in
the
hollow
,
and
look
at
Philip
again
,
she
say
in
a
serious
,
sad
voice
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
could
have
be
friend
,
 
I
mean
,
if
it
would
have
be
good
and
right
for
us
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
the
trial
I
have
to
bear
in
everything
;
I
may
not
keep
anything
I
use
to
love
when
I
be
little
.
<EOS>
the
old
book
go
;
and
Tom
be
different
,
and
my
father
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
death
.
<EOS>
I
must
part
with
everything
I
care
for
when
I
be
a
child
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
part
with
you
;
we
must
never
take
any
notice
of
each
other
again
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
want
to
speak
to
you
for
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
let
you
know
that
Tom
and
I
can
not
do
as
we
like
about
such
thing
,
and
that
if
I
behave
as
if
I
have
forget
all
about
you
,
it
be
not
out
of
envy
or
pride
 
or
 
or
any
bad
feeling

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
speak
with
more
and
more
sorrowful
gentleness
as
she
go
on
,
and
her
eye
begin
to
fill
with
tear
.
<EOS>
the
deepen
expression
of
pain
on
Philip
's
face
give
him
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
boyish
self
,
and
make
the
deformity
appeal
more
strongly
to
her
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
;
I
see
all
that
you
mean
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
voice
that
have
become
feebler
from
discouragement
;
"
I
know
what
there
be
to
keep
us
apart
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
right
<EOS>
,
Maggie
,
 
do
not
you
be
angry
with
me
,
I
be
so
used
to
call
you
Maggie
in
my
thought
,
 
it
be
not
right
to
sacrifice
everything
to
other
people
's
unreasonable
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
up
a
great
deal
for
_
my
_
father
;
but
I
would
not
give
up
a
friendship
or
 
or
an
attachment
of
any
sort
,
in
obedience
to
any
wish
of
his
that
I
do
not
recognize
as
right

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know

"
say
Maggie
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
often
,
when
I
have
be
angry
and
discontent
,
it
have
seem
to
me
that
I
be
not
bind
to
give
up
anything
;
and
I
have
go
on
think
till
it
have
seem
to
me
that
I
could
think
away
all
my
duty
.
<EOS>
but
no
good
have
ever
come
of
that
;
it
be
an
evil
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
that
whatever
I
may
do
,
I
should
wish
in
the
end
that
I
have
go
without
anything
for
myself

rather
than
have
make
my
father
's
life
harder
to
him

<EOS>
"
but
would
it
make
his

harder

be
to
see
each

say
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
say
something
else
,
but
check
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
be
sure
he

<EOS>
do
not

me
why

Maggie

in
a
distressed
tone

<EOS>
"
My

so
strongly
about

He

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I

Philip
,
impetuously
;
"
I
be
not
happy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why

"
say
Maggie
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
at
least
 
I
ought
not
to
ask
 
<EOS>

I
be
very
,
very
sorry

<EOS>
Philip
turn
to
walk
on
,
as
if
he
have
not
patience
to
stand
still
any
longer
,
and
they
go
out
of
the
hollow
,
wind
amongst
the
tree
and
bush
in
silence
.
<EOS>
after
that
last
word
of
Philip
's
,
Maggie
could
not
bear
to
insist
immediately
on
their
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
a
great
deal
happy
,
"
she
say
at
last
,
timidly
,
"
since
I
have
give
up
think
about
what
be
easy
and
pleasant
,
and
be
discontent
because
I
could
not
have
my
own
will
.
<EOS>
Our
life
be
determined
for
us
;
and
it
make
the
mind
very
free
when
we
give
up
wishing
,

only

of
bear
what
be
lay
upon

and
do
what
be
give
us
to

<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
give
up
wish

say
Philip
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
we
can
never
give
up
longing
and
wish
while
we
be
thoroughly
alive
.
<EOS>
there
be
certain
thing
we
feel
to
be
beautiful
and
good
,
and
we

must
_
hunger
after
them

<EOS>
how
can
we
ever
be
satisfied
without
them
until
our
feeling
be
deaden

<EOS>
I
delight
in
fine
picture
;
I
long
to
be
able
to
paint
such
.
<EOS>
I
strive
and
strive
,

can
not
produce
what
I
want

<EOS>
that
be
pain

me

and
always
_
will
_
be
pain
,
until
my
faculty
lose
their
keenness
,
like
aged
eye

<EOS>
then
there
be
many
other
thing
I
long
for

"
 
here
<EOS>
Philip
hesitate
a
little
,
and
then
say
,
 
"
thing
that
other
man
have
,
and
that
will
always
be
deny
me

<EOS>
My
life
will
have
nothing
great

beautiful
in
it

I
would
rather
not
have
live

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Philip
,
"
say
Maggie
,
"
I
wish
you
do
not

so

"
but
her
heart
begin
to
beat
with
something
of
Philip
's
discontent

<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
turn
quickly
round
and
fix
his
gray
eye
entreatingly
on
her
face
,
"
I
should
be
content
to
live
,
if
you
would
let
me
see
you
sometimes

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
check
by
a
fear
which
her
face
suggest
,
he
look
away
again
and
say
more
calmly
,
"
I
have
no
friend

I
can
tell
everything

no

you

talk
to
you

me
that
you
care
for
me

that
we
may
always
be
friend
in
heart

help
each

I
may
come

glad

<EOS>

but
how
can
I
see
you
,
Philip
?

say
Maggie
,
falteringly
.
<EOS>
(
Could
she
really
do
him
good
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
very
hard
to
say
"
good
-
by
"
this
day
,
and
not
speak
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
new
interest
to
vary
the
day
;
it
be
so
much
easy
to
renounce
the
interest
before
it
come
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
would
let
me
see
you
here
sometimes
,
 
walk
with
you
here
,
 
I
would
be
content
if
it
be
only
once
or
twice
in
a
month
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
could
injure
no
one

happiness

it
would
sweeten
my
life

besides
,
"
Philip
go
on
,
with
all
the
inventive
astuteness
of
love
at
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
"
if
there
be
any
enmity
between
those
who
belong
to
us
,
we
ought
all
the
more
to
try
and
quench
it
by
our
friendship
;
I
mean
,
that
by
our
influence
on
both
side
we
may
bring
about
a
healing
of
the
wound
that
have
be
make
in
the
past
,
if
I
could
know
everything
about
them
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
believe
there
be
any
enmity
in
my
own
father
's
mind
;
I
think
he
have
prove
the
contrary
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
shake
her
head
slowly
,
and
be
silent
,
under
conflict
thought
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
inclination
,
that
to
see
Philip
now
and
then
,
and
keep
up
the
bond
of
friendship
with
him
,
be
something
not
only
innocent
,
but
good
;
perhaps
she
may
really
help
him
to
find
contentment
as
she
have
find
it
.
<EOS>
the
voice
that
say
this
make
sweet
music
to
Maggie
;
but
athwart
it
there
come
an
urgent
,
monotonous
warning
from
another
voice
which
she
have
be
learn
to
obey
,
 
the
warning
that
such
interview
imply
secrecy
;
imply
do
something
she
would
dread
to
be
discover
in
,
something
that
,
if
discover
,
must
cause
anger
and
pain
;
and
that
the
admission
of
anything
so
near
doubleness
would
act
as
a
spiritual
blight
.
<EOS>
yet
the
music
would
swell
out
again
,
like
chime
bear
onward
by
a
recurrent
breeze
,
persuade
her
that
the
wrong
lie
all
in
the
fault
and
weakness
of
other
,
and
that
there
be
such
a
thing
as
futile
sacrifice
for
one
to
the
injury
of
another
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
cruel
for
Philip
that
he
should
be
shrink
from
,
because
of
an
unjustifiable
vindictiveness
toward
his
father
,
 
poor
Philip
,
whom
some
people
would
shrink
from
only
because
he
be
deform
.
<EOS>
the
idea
that
he
may
become
her
lover
or
that
her
meeting
him
could
cause
disapproval
in
that
light
,
have
not
occur
to
her
;
and
Philip
see
the
absence
of
this
idea
clearly
enough
,
see
it
with
a
certain
pang
,
although
it
make
her
consent
to
his
request
the
less
unlikely
.
<EOS>
there
be
bitterness
to
him
in
the
perception
that
Maggie
be
almost
as
frank
and
unconstrained
toward
him
as
when
she
be
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
either
yes
or
no
,
"
she
say
at
last
,
turn
round
and
walk
toward
the
way
she
come
;
"
I
must
wait
,
lest
I
should
decide
wrongly
.
<EOS>
I
must
seek
for
guidance
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

May
I
come
again
,
then
,
to

morrow
,
or
the
next
day

or
next
week

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
better
write
,
"
say
Maggie
,
falter
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
go
to
<EOS>
St.
Ogg
's
sometimes
,

I
can
put
the

<EOS>
"
oh
no

Philip
eagerly
;

that
would
not

so
well

My
father
may
see
the
letter
 
<EOS>
and
 
he
have
not
any
enmity
,
I
believe
,
but
<EOS>
he
view
thing
differently
from
me
;
he
think
a
great
deal
about
wealth
and
position
.
<EOS>
pray
let
me
come
here
once
more
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Tell
_
me
when
it
shall
be
;

if
you
can
not
tell
me
,
I
will
come
as
often
as
I
can
till
I
do
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
be
so
,
then
,
"
say
Maggie
,
"
for
I
can
not
be
quite
certain
of
come
here
any
particular
evening
.

<EOS>
Maggie
feel
a
great
relief
in
adjourn
the
decision
.
<EOS>
She
be
free
now
to
enjoy
the
minute
of
companionship
;
she
almost
think
she
may
linger
a
little
;
the
next
time
they
meet
she
should
have
to
pain
Philip
by
tell
him
her
determination
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
think
,
"
she
say
,
look
smilingly
at
him
,
after
a
few
moment
of
silence
,
"
how
strange
it
be
that
we
should
have
meet
and
talk
to
each
other
,
just
as
if
it
have
be
only
yesterday
when
we
part
at
Lorton
.
<EOS>
and
yet
we
must
both
be
very
much
alter
in
those
five
year
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
five
year
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
<EOS>
you
seem
to
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
I
be
the
same
Maggie
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
quite
so
sure
that
you
would
be
the
same
;
I
know
you
be
so
clever
,
and
you
must
have
see
and
learn
so
much
to
fill
your
mind
;
I
be
not
quite
sure
you
would
care
about
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
have
any
doubt
that
you
would
be
the
same

whenever
I
migh
see
you

say
Philip
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
the

in
everything
that
make
me
like
you
better
than
any
one
else

<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
explain
that
;
I
do
not
think
any
of
the
strong
effect
our
nature
be
susceptible
of
can
ever
be
explain
.
<EOS>
We
can
neither
detect
the
process
by
which
they
be
arrive
at
,
nor
the
mode
in
which
they
act
on
us

<EOS>
the
great
of
painter
only
once
paint
a
mysteriously
divine
child
;
he
could
not
have
tell
how
he
do
it
,
and
we
can
not
tell
why
we
feel
it
to
be
divine
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
store
lay
up
in
our
human
nature
that
our
understanding
can
make
no
complete
inventory
of
.
<EOS>
certain
strain
of
music
affect
me
so
strangely
;
I
can
never
hear
them
without
their
change
my
whole
attitude
of

for
a
time

if
the
effect
would
last

I
may
be
capable

heroism

in

Maggie

absorb

suddenly
she
close

shake

side

once

hurry
away

disappear
behind

though
Philip

You
can

severely

He
be
four

five
year
old

Maggie

have
a
full
consciousness
of
his
feeling
toward
her
to
aid
him

foresee
the
character
his
contemplate
interview
with
her
would
bear
in
the
opinion
of
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
suppose
that
he
be
capable
of
a
gross
selfishness
,
or
that
he
could
have
be
satisfy
without
persuade
himself
that
he
be
seek
to
infuse
some
happiness
into
Maggie
's
life
,
 
seek
this
even
more
than
any
direct
end
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
could
give
her
sympathy
;
he
could
give
her
help
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
slight
promise
of
love
toward
him
in
her
manner
;
it
be
nothing
more
than
the
sweet
girlish
tenderness
she
have
show
him
when
she
be
twelve
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
would
never
love
him
;
perhaps
no
woman
ever
_
<EOS>
could
_
love
him
.
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
he
would
endure
that
;
he
should
at
least
have
the
happiness
of
see
her
,
of
feel
some
nearness
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
he
clutch
passionately
the
possibility
that
she
_
may
_
love
him
;
perhaps
the
feeling
would
grow
,
if
she
could
come
to
associate
him
with
that
watchful
tenderness
which
her
nature
would
be
so
keenly
alive
to
.
<EOS>
if
any
woman
could
love
him
,
surely
Maggie
be
that
woman
;
there
be
such
wealth
of
love
in
her
,
and
there
be
no
one
to
claim
it
all
.
<EOS>
then
,
the
pity
of
it
,
that
a
mind
like
hers
should
be
wither
in
its
very
youth
,
like
a
young
forest
-
tree
,
for
want
of
the
light
and
space
it
be
form
to
flourish
in
!
<EOS>
Could
he
not
hinder
that
,
by
persuade
her
out
of
her
system
of
privation
?
<EOS>
He
would
be
her
guardian
angel
;
he
would
do
anything
,
bear
anything
,
for
her
sake
 
except
not
see
her
.
    
<EOS>
Aunt
Glegg
learn
the
Breadth
of
Bob
's
Thumb
  
<EOS>
while
Maggie
's
life
-
struggle
have
lie
almost
entirely
within
her
own
soul
,
one
shadowy
army
fight
another
,
and
the
slain
shadow
forever
rise
again
<EOS>
,
Tom
be
engage
in
a
dustier
,
noisier
warfare
,
grapple
with
more
substantial
obstacle
,
and
gain
more
definite
conquest
.
<EOS>
so
it
have
be
since
the
day
of
Hecuba
,
and
of
Hector
,
Tamer
of
horse
;
inside
the
gate
,
the
woman
with
stream
hair
and
uplifted
hand
offer
prayer
,
watch
the
world
's
combat
from
afar
,
fill
their
long
,
empty
day
with
memory
and
fear
;
outside
,
the
man
,
in
fierce
struggle
with
thing
divine
and
human
,
quench
memory
in
the
strong
light
of
purpose
,
lose
the
sense
of
dread
and
even
of
wound
in
the
hurry
ardor
of
action
.
  
<EOS>
from
what
you
have
see
of
Tom
,
I
think
he
be
not
a
youth
of
whom
you
would
prophesy
failure
in
anything
he
have
thoroughly
wish
;
the
wager
be
likely
to
be
on
his
side
,
notwithstanding
his
small
success
in
the
classic
.
<EOS>
for
Tom
have
never
desire
success
in
this
field
of
enterprise
;
and
for
get
a
fine
flourish
growth
of
stupidity
there
be
nothing
like
pour
out
on
a
mind
a
good
amount
of
subject
in
which
it
feel
no
interest
.
<EOS>
but
now
Tom
's
strong
will
bound
together
his
integrity
,
his
pride
,
his
family
regret
,
and
his
personal
ambition
,
and
make
them
one
force
,
concentrate
his
effort
and
surmount
discouragement
.
<EOS>
His
uncle
Deane
,
who
watch
him
closely
,
soon
begin
to
conceive
hope
of
him
,
and
to
be
rather
proud
that
he
have
bring
into
the
employment
of
the
firm
a
nephew
who
appear
to
be
make
of
such
good
commercial
stuff
.
<EOS>
the
real
kindness
of
place
him
in
the
warehouse
first
be
soon
evident
to
Tom
,
in
the
hint
his
uncle
begin
to
throw
out
,
that
after
a
time
he
may
perhaps
be
trust
to
travel
at
certain
season
,
and
buy
in
for
the
firm
various
vulgar
commodity
with
which
I
need
not
shock
refined
ear
in
this
place
;
and
it
be
doubtless
with
a
view
to
this
result
that
Mr.
Deane
,
when
he
expect
to
take
his
wine
alone
,
would
tell
Tom
to
step
in
and
sit
with
him
an
hour
,
and
would
pass
that
hour
in
much
lecturing
and
catechising
concern
article
of
export
and
import
,
with
an
occasional
excursus
of
more
indirect
utility
on
the
relative
advantage
to
the
merchant
of
St.
Ogg
's
of
have
good
bring
in
their
own
and
in
foreign
bottom
,
 
a
subject
on
which
Mr.
Deane
,
as
a
ship
-
owner
,
naturally
throw
off
a
few
spark
when
he
get
warm
with
talk
and
wine
.
  
<EOS>
already
,
in
the
second
year
,
Tom
's
salary
be
raise
;
but
all
,
except
the
price
of
his
dinner
and
clothe
,
go
home
into
the
tin
box
;
and
he
shun
comradeship
,
lest
it
should
lead
him
into
expense
in
spite
of
himself
.
<EOS>
not
that
Tom
be
mould
on
the
spoony
type
of
the
Industrious
Apprentice
;
he
have
a
very
strong
appetite
for
pleasure
,
 
would
have
like
to
be
a
Tamer
of
horse
and
to
make
a
distinguished
figure
in
all
neighboring
eye
,
dispense
treat
and
benefit
to
other
with
well
-
judge
liberality
,
and
be
pronounce
one
of
the
fine
young
fellow
of
those
part
;
nay
,
he
determine
to
achieve
these
thing
sooner
or
later
;
but
his
practical
shrewdness
tell
him
that
the
mean
no
such
achievement
could
only
lie
for
him
in
present
abstinence
and
self
-
denial
;
there
be
certain
milestone
to
be
pass
,
and
one
of
the
first
be
the
payment
of
his
father
's
debt
.
<EOS>
have
make
up
his
mind
on
that
point
,
he
stride
along
without
swerve
,
contract
some
rather
saturnine
sternness
,
as
a
young
man
be
likely
to
do
who
have
a
premature
call
upon
him
for
self
-
reliance
.
<EOS>
Tom
feel
intensely
that
common
cause
with
his
father
which
spring
from
family
pride
,
and
be
bent
on
be
irreproachable
as
a
son
;
but
his
grow
experience
cause
him
to
pass
much
silent
criticism
on
the
rashness
and
imprudence
of
his
father
's
past
conduct
;
their
disposition
be
not
in
sympathy
,
and
Tom
's
face
show
little
radiance
during
his
few
home
hour
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
an
awe
of
him
,
against
which
she
struggle
as
something
unfair
to
her
consciousness
of
wide
thought
and
deep
motive
;
but
it
be
of
no
use
to
struggle
.
<EOS>
a
character
at
unity
with
itself
 
<EOS>
that
perform
what
it
intend
,
subdue
every
counteracting
impulse
,
and
have
no
vision
beyond
the
distinctly
possible
 
<EOS>
be
strong
by
its
very
negation
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
that
Tom
's
more
and
more
obvious
unlikeness
to
his
father
be
well
fit
to
conciliate
the
maternal
aunt
and
uncle
;
and
Mr.
Deane
's
favorable
report
and
prediction
to
Mr.
Glegg
concern
Tom
's
qualification
for
business
begin
to
be
discuss
amongst
them
with
various
acceptance
.
<EOS>
He
be
likely
,
it
appear
,
to
do
the
family
credit
without
cause
it
any
expense
and
trouble
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Pullet
have
always
think
it
strange
if
Tom
's
excellent
complexion
,
so
entirely
that
of
the
Dodsons
,
do
not
argue
a
certainty
that
he
would
turn
out
well
;
his
juvenile
error
of
run
down
the
peacock
,
and
general
disrespect
to
his
aunt
,
only
indicate
a
tinge
of
Tulliver
blood
which
he
have
doubtless
outgrown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
who
have
contract
a
cautious
liking
for
Tom
ever
since
his
spirited
and
sensible
behavior
when
the
execution
be
in
the
house
,
be
now
warm
into
a
resolution
to
further
his
prospect
actively
,
 
some
time
,
when
an
opportunity
offer
of
do
so
in
a
prudent
manner
,
without
ultimate
loss
;
but
Mrs.
Glegg
observe
that
she
be
not
give
to
speak
without
book
,
as
some
people
be
;
that
those
who
say
least
be
most
likely
to
find
their
word
make
good
;
and
that
when
the
right
moment
come
,
it
would
be
see
who
could
do
something
well
than
talk
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Pullet
,
after
silent
meditation
for
a
period
of
several
lozenge
,
come
distinctly
to
the
conclusion
,
that
when
a
young
man
be
likely
to
do
well
,
it
be
well
not
to
meddle
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
meanwhile
,
have
show
no
disposition
to
rely
on
any
one
but
himself
,
though
,
with
a
natural
sensitiveness
toward
all
indication
of
favorable
opinion
,
he
be
glad
to
see
his
uncle
<EOS>
Glegg
look
in
on
him
sometimes
in
a
friendly
way
during
business
hour
,
and
glad
to
be
invite
to
dine
at
his
house
,
though
he
usually
prefer
decline
on
the
ground
that
he
be
not
sure
of
be
punctual
.
<EOS>
but
about
a
year
ago
,
something
have
occur
which
induce
Tom
to
test
his
uncle
Glegg
's
friendly
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
Bob
Jakin
,
who
rarely
return
from
one
of
his
round
without
see
Tom
and
Maggie
,
await
him
on
the
bridge
as
he
be
come
home
from
St.
Ogg
's
one
evening
,
that
they
may
have
a
little
private
talk
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
liberty
of
ask
if
Mr.
Tom
have
ever
think
of
make
money
by
trade
a
bit
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
trading
,
how
?
<EOS>
Tom
wish
to
know
.
<EOS>
why
,
by
send
out
a
bit
of
a
cargo
to
foreign
port
;
because
Bob
have
a
particular
friend
who
have
offer
to
do
a
little
business
for
him
in
that
way
in
laceham
good
,
and
would
be
glad
to
serve
Mr.
Tom
on
the
same
footing
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
interested
at
once
,
and
beg
for
full
explanation
,
wonder
he
have
not
think
of
this
plan
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
so
well
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
a
speculation
that
may
change
the
slow
process
of
addition
into
multiplication
,
that
he
at
once
determine
to
mention
the
matter
to
his
father
,
and
get
his
consent
to
appropriate
some
of
the
saving
in
the
tin
box
to
the
purchase
of
a
small
cargo
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
not
have
consult
his
father
,
but
he
have
just
pay
his
last
quarter
's
money
into
the
tin
box
,
and
there
be
no
other
resource
.
<EOS>
all
the
saving
be
there
;
for
Mr.
Tulliver
would
not
consent
to
put
the
money
out
at
interest
lest
he
should
lose
it
.
<EOS>
since
he
have
speculate
in
the
purchase
of
some
corn
,
and
have
lose
by
it
,
he
could
not
be
easy
without
keep
the
money
under
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
approach
the
subject
carefully
,
as
he
be
seat
on
the
hearth
with
his
father
that
evening
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
listen
,
lean
forward
in
his
arm
-
chair
and
look
up
in
Tom
's
face
with
a
sceptical
glance
.
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
be
to
give
a
positive
refusal
,
but
he
be
in
some
awe
of
Tom
's
wish
,
and
since
he
have
the
sense
of
be
an
"
unlucky
"
father
,
he
have
lose
some
of
his
old
peremptoriness
and
determination
to
be
master
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
key
of
the
bureau
from
his
pocket
,
get
out
the
key
of
the
large
chest
,
and
fetch
down
the
tin
box
,
 
slowly
,
as
if
he
be
try
to
defer
the
moment
of
a
painful
parting
.
<EOS>
then
he
seat
himself
against
the
table
,
and
open
the
box
with
that
little
padlock
-
key
which
he
finger
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
in
all
vacant
moment
.
<EOS>
there
they
be
,
the
dingy
bank
-
note
and
the
bright
sovereign
,
and
he
count
them
out
on
the
table
 
only
a
hundred
and
sixteen
pound
in
two
year
,
after
all
the
pinch
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
much
do
you
want
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
speak
as
if
the
word
burn
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
I
begin
with
the
thirty
-
six
pound
,
father
?
"
say
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
separate
this
sum
from
the
rest
,
and
keep
his
hand
over
it
,
say
:
  
"
It
be
as
much
as
I
can
save
out
o
<EOS>
'
my
pay
in
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
father
;
it
be
such
slow
work
,
save
out
of
the
little
money
we
get
.
<EOS>
and
in
this
way
we
may
double
our
saving
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
my
lad
,
"
say
the
father
,
keep
his
hand
on
the
money
,
"
but
you
may
lose
it
,
 
you
may
lose
a
year
o

<EOS>
my
life
,
 
and
I
have
not
get
many
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
know
I
would
not
pay
a
dividend
with
the
first
hundred
,
because
I
want
to
see
it
all
in
a
lump
,
 
and
when
I
see
it
,
I
be
sure
on't
.
<EOS>
if
you
trust
to
luck
,
it
be
sure
to
be
against
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
Old
Harry
's
get
the
luck
in
his
hand
;
and
if
I
lose
one
year
,
I
shall
never
pick
it
up
again
;
<EOS>
death

ull
<EOS>
o'ertake
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
's
voice
tremble
,
and
Tom
be
silent
for
a
few
minute
before
he
say
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
it
up
,
father
,
since
you
object
to
it
so
strongly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
unwilling
to
abandon
the
scheme
altogether
,
he
determine
to
ask
his
uncle
Glegg
to
venture
twenty
pound
,
on
condition
of
receive
five
per
cent
.
<EOS>
of
the
profit
.
<EOS>
that
be
really
a
very
small
thing
to
ask
.
<EOS>
so
when
Bob
call
the
next
day
at
the
wharf
to
know
the
decision
,
Tom
propose
that
they
should
go
together
to
his
uncle
Glegg
's
to
open
the
business
;
for
his
diffident
pride
clung
to
him
,
and
make
him
feel
that
Bobs

tongue
would
relieve
him
from
some
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
,
at
the
pleasant
hour
of
four
in
the
afternoon
of
a
hot
August
day
,
be
naturally
count
his
wall

fruit
to
assure
himself
that
the
sum
total
have
not
vary
since
yesterday
.
<EOS>
to
him
enter
Tom
,
in
what
appear
to
Mr.
Glegg
very
questionable
companionship
,
 
that
of
a
man
with
a
pack
on
his
back
,
 
for
Bob
be
equip
for
a
new
journey
,
 
and
of
a
huge
brindle
bull
-
terrier
,
who
walk
with
a
slow

sway
movement
from
side

and
glance
from
under
his
eye
-
lid
with
a
surly
indifference
which
may
after
all
be
a
cover
to
the
most
offensive
design

<EOS>
Mr.
Glegg
's
spectacle
,
which
have
be
assist
him
in
count
the
fruit
,
make
these
suspicious
detail
alarmingly
evident
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heigh

<EOS>
heigh

<EOS>
keep

"
<EOS>
he
shout

snatch
up
a

very
well

Mrs.

to
get
her
knitting
with
the
sense
that
any
further
remark
after
this
would
be
bathos

<EOS>
salt
 
that
eminently
"
briny
chap
"
 
have
be
discover
in
a
cloud
of
tobacco
-
smoke
at
the
Anchor
Tavern
,
Mr.
Glegg
commence
inquiry
which
turn
out
satisfactorily
enough
to
warrant
the
advance
of
the
"
nest
-
egg
,
"
to
which
aunt
Glegg
contribute
twenty
pound
;
and
in
this
modest
beginning
you
see
the
ground
of
a
fact
which
may
otherwise
surprise
you
;
namely
,
Tom
's
accumulation
of
a
fund
,
unknown
to
his
father
,
that
promise
in
no
very
long
time
to
meet
the
more
tardy
process
of
saving
,
and
quite
cover
the
deficit
.
<EOS>
when
once
his
attention
have
be
turn
to
this
source
of
gain
,
Tom
determine
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
and
lose
on
opportunity
of
obtain
information
and
extend
his
small
enterprise
.
<EOS>
in
not
tell
his
father
,
he
be
influence
by
that
strange
mixture
of
opposite
feeling
which
often
give
equal
truth
to
those
who
blame
an
action
and
those
who
admire
it
,
 
partly
,
it
be
that
disinclination
to
confidence
which
be
see
between
near
kindred
,
that
family
repulsion
which
spoil
the
most
sacred
relation
of
our
life
;
partly
,
it
be
the
desire
to
surprise
his
father
with
a
great
joy
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
see
that
it
would
have
be
well
to
soothe
the
interval
with
a
new
hope
,
and
prevent
the
delirium
of
a
too
sudden
elation
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
Maggie
's
first
meeting
with
Philip
,
Tom
have
already
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
pound
of
his
own
capital
;
and
while
they
be
walk
by
the
evening
light
in
the
Red
Deeps
,
he
,
by
the
same
evening
light
,
be
ride
into
Laceham
,
proud
of
be
on
his
first
journey
on
behalf
of
Guest
&
Co.
,
and
revolve
in
his
mind
all
the
chance
that
by
the
end
of
another
year
he
should
have
double
his
gain
,
lift
off
the
obloquy
of
debt
from
his
father
's
name
,
and
perhaps
 
for
he
should
be
twenty
-
one
 
have
get
a
new
start
for
himself
,
on
a
high
platform
of
employment
.
<EOS>
do
he
not
desire
it
?
<EOS>
He
be
quite
sure
that
he
do
.
    
<EOS>
the
Wavering
Balance
  
<EOS>
I
say
that
Maggie
go
home
that
evening
from
the
Red
deep
with
a
mental
conflict
already
begin
.
<EOS>
You
have
see
clearly
enough
,
in
her
interview
with
Philip
,
what
that
conflict
be
.
<EOS>
here
suddenly
be
an
opening
in
the
rocky
wall
which
shut
in
the
narrow
valley
of
humiliation
,
where
all
her
prospect
be
the
remote
,
unfathomed
sky
;
and
some
of
the
memory
-
haunt
earthly
delight
be
no
longer
out
of
her
reach
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
book
,
converse
,
affection
;
she
may
hear
tiding
of
the
world
from
which
her
mind
have
not
yet
lose
its
sense
of
exile
;
and
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
Philip
too
,
who
be
pitiable
,
 
clearly
not
happy
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
here
be
an
opportunity
indicate
for
make
her
mind
more
worthy
of
its
high
service
;
perhaps
the
noble
,
complete
devoutness
could
hardly
exist
without
some
width
of
knowledge
;
_
must
_
she
always
live
in
this
resign
imprisonment
?
<EOS>
It
be
so
blameless
,
<EOS>
so
good
a
thing
that
there
should
be
friendship
between
her
and
Philip
;
the
motive
that
forbid
it
be
so
unreasonable
,
so
unchristian
!
<EOS>
but
the
severe
monotonous
warning
come
again
and
again
,
 
that
she
be
lose
the
simplicity
and
clearness
of
her
life
by
admit
a
ground
of
concealment
;
and
that
,
by
forsake
the
simple
rule
of
renunciation
,
she
be
throw
herself
under
the
seductive
guidance
of
illimitable
want
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
have
win
strength
to
obey
the
warning
before
she
allow
herself
the
next
week
to
turn
her
step
in
the
evening
to
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
but
while
she
be
resolve
to
say
an
affectionate
farewell
to
Philip
,
how
she
look
forward
to
that
evening
walk
in
the
still
,
fleckered
shade
of
the
hollow
,
away
from
all
that
be
harsh
and
unlovely
;
to
the
affectionate
,
admire
look
that
would
meet
her
;
to
the
sense
of
comradeship
that
childish
memory
would
give
to
wise
,
old
talk
;
to
the
certainty
that
Philip
would
care
to
hear
everything
she
say
,
which
no
one
else
care
for
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
half
-
hour
that
it
would
be
very
hard
to
turn
her
back
upon
,
with
the
sense
that
there
would
be
no
other
like
it
.
<EOS>
yet
she
say
what
she
mean
to
say
;
she
look
firm
as
well
as
sad
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
,
I
have
make
up
my
mind
;
it
be
right
that
we
should
give
each
other
up
,
in
everything
but
memory
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
you
without
concealment
 
<EOS>
stay
<EOS>
,
I
know
what
you
be
go
to
say
,
 
it
be
other
people
's
wrong
feeling
that
make
concealment
necessary
;
but
concealment
be
bad
,
however
it
may
be
cause
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
it
would
be
bad
for
me
,
for
us
both
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
our
secret
be
discover
,
there
would
be
nothing
but
misery
,
 
dreadful
anger
;
and
then
we
must
part
after
all
,
and
it
would
be
hard
,
when
we
be
use
to
see
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
face
have
flush
,
and
there
be
a
momentary
eagerness
of
expression
,
as
if
he
have
be
about
to
resist
this
decision
with
all
his
might
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
control
himself
,
and
say
,
with
assumed
calmness
:
"
<EOS>
well
,
Maggie
,
if
we
must
part
,
let
us
try
and
forget
it
for
one
half
hour
;
let
us
talk
together
a
little
while
,
for
the
last
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
,
and
Maggie
feel
no
reason
to
withdraw
it
;
his
quietness
make
her
all
the
more
sure
she
have
give
him
great
pain
,
and
she
want
to
show
him
how
unwillingly
she
have
give
it
.
<EOS>
They
walk
together
hand
in
hand
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
sit
down
in
the
hollow
,
"
say
Philip
,
"
where
we
stand
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
see
how
the
dog
-
rose
have
strew
the
ground
,
and
spread
their
opal
petal
over
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
sit
down
at
the
root
of
the
slant
ash
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
begin
my
picture
of
you
among
the
Scotch
fir
,
Maggie
,
"
say
Philip
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
must
let
me
study
your
face
a
little
,
while
you
stay
,
 
since
I
be
not
to
see
it
again
.
<EOS>
please
turn
your
head
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
say
in
an
entreat
voice
,
and
it
would
have
be
very
hard
of
Maggie
to
refuse
.
<EOS>
the
full
,
lustrous
face
,
with
the
bright
black
coronet
,
look
down
like
that
of
a
divinity
well
pleased
to
be
worship
,
on
the
pale
-
hued
,
small
-
featured
face
that
be
turn
up
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
sit
for
my
second
portrait
then
,
"
she
say
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
it
be
large
than
the
other
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
much
large
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
oil
-
painting
.
<EOS>
You
will
look
like
a
tall
Hamadryad
,
dark
and
strong
and
noble
,
just
issue
from
one
of
the
fir
-
tree
,
when
the
stem
be
cast
their
afternoon
shadow
on
the
grass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
think
more
of
paint
than
of
anything
now
,
Philip
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
do
,
"
say
Philip
,
rather
sadly
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
of
too
many
thing
,
 
sow
all
sort
of
seed
,
and
get
no
great
harvest
from
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
curse
with
susceptibility
in
every
direction
,
and
effective
faculty
in
none
.
<EOS>
I
care
for
painting
and
music
;
I
care
for
classic
literature
,
and
mediæval
literature
,
and
modern
literature
;
I
flutter
all
way
,
and
fly
in
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
surely
that
be
a
happiness
to
have
so
many
taste
,
 
to
enjoy
so
many
beautiful
thing
,
when
they
be
within
your
reach
,
"
say
Maggie
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
It
always
seem
to
me
a
sort
of
clever
stupidity
only
to
have
one
sort
of
talent
,
 
almost
like
a
carrier
-
pigeon
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
a
happiness
to
have
many
taste
if
I
be
like
other
man
,
"
say
Philip
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
get
some
power
and
distinction
by
mere
mediocrity
,
as
they
do
;
at
least
I
should
get
those
middling
satisfaction
which
make
man
content
to
do
without
great
one
.
<EOS>
I
may
think
society
at
St.
Ogg
's
agreeable
then
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
could
make
life
worth
<EOS>
the
purchase
-
money
of
pain
to
me
,
but
some
faculty
that
would
lift
me
above
the
dead
level
of
provincial
existence
.
<EOS>
yes
,
there
be
one
thing
,
 
a
passion
answer
as
well
as
a
faculty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
do
not
hear
the
last
word
;
she
be
struggle
against
the
consciousness
that
Philip
's
word
have
set
her
own
discontent
vibrate
again
as
it
use
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
what
you
mean
,
"
she
say
,
"
though
I
know
so
much
less
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
I
could
never
bear
life
if
it
keep
on
be
the
same
every
day
,
and
I
must
always
be
do
thing
of
no
consequence
,
and
never
know
anything
great
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Philip
,
I
think
we
be
only
like
child
that
some
one
who
be
wise
be
take
care
of
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
right
to
resign
ourselves
entirely
,
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
deny
us
?
<EOS>
I
have
find
great
peace
in
that
for
the
last
two
or
three
year
,
even
joy
in
subdue
my
own
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Maggie
,
"
say
Philip
,
vehemently
;
"
and
you
be
shut
yourself
up
in
a
narrow
,
self
-
delusive
fanaticism
,
which
be
only
a
way
of
escape
pain
by
starve
into
dulness
all
the
high
power
of
your
nature
.
<EOS>
joy
and
peace
be
not
resignation
;
resignation
be
the
willing
endurance
of
a
pain
that
be
not
allay
,
that
you
do
not
expect
to
be
allay
.
<EOS>
stupefaction
be
not
resignation
;
and
it
be
stupefaction
to
remain
in
ignorance
,
 
to
shut
up
all
the
avenue
by
which
the
life
of
your
fellow
-
man
may
become
known
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
resign
;
I
be
not
sure
that
life
be
long
enough
to
learn
that
lesson
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
be
not
resign

you
be
only
try
to
stupefy
yourself

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
lip
tremble
;
she
feel
there
be
some
truth
in
what
Philip
say
,
and
yet
there
be
a
deep
consciousness
that
,
for
any
immediate
application
it
have
to
her
conduct
,
it
be
no
well
than
falsity
.
<EOS>
Her
double
impression
correspond
to
the
double
impulse
of
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
Philip
seriously
believe
what
he
say
,
but
he
say
it
with
vehemence
because
it
make
an
argument
against
the
resolution
that
oppose
his
wish
.
<EOS>
but
Maggie
's
face
,
make
more
childlike
by
the
gathering
tear
,
touch
him
with
a
tenderer
,
less
egotistic
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
and
say
gently
:
  
"
do
not
let
us
think
of
such
thing
in
this
short
half
-
hour

Maggie

only
care
about
be
together

<EOS>
We
shall
be
friend
in

separation

We
shall
always
think
of
each

<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad

live
as
long

come
a
time

when
I
can
 
when
you
will
let
me
help
you
in
some
way

"
what
a
dear

good
brother
you
would
have
be
,
Philip
,
"
say
Maggie
,
smile
through
the
haze
of
tear
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
have
make
as
much
fuss
about
me
,
and
be
as
pleased
for
me
to
love
you
,
as
would
have
satisfy
even
me
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
love
me
well
enough
to
bear
with
me
,
and
forgive
me
everything
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
always
long
that
Tom
should
do

I
be
never
satisfied
with
a

of
anything

why
it

well
for
me
to
do
without
earthly
happiness
altogether

I
never

I
have
enough
music

I
want
more
instrument
play

I
want
voice

full

you

she
add
abruptly

go
before

"
yes

afternoon

the

all

out

you
speak
so
bitterly
to
me

no

no

start
and
pause

look
at

alarm

no

sometimes

your
brother

as
you
say
at
Lorton

<EOS>
It
be
less
wrong

commit
this

<EOS>
Maggie
feel
unable
to
speak

She
shake
her
head
and
walk
on
in
silence

till
they
come
to
the
end
of

Scotch
fir

she
put
out
her
hand
in
sign
of
parting

you

come

It
be
the
moment
when
our
resolution
seem
about
to
become
irrevocable
 
when
the
fatal
iron
gate
be
about
to
close
upon
us
 
that
test
our
strength
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
hour
of
clear
reasoning
and
firm
conviction
,
we
snatch
at
any
sophistry
that
will
nullify
our
long
struggle

bring
us
the
defeat
that
we
love
better
than
victory

<EOS>
Maggie
feel
her
heart
leap
at
this
subterfuge
of
Philip

,
and
there
pass
over
her
face
that
almost
imperceptible
shock
which
accompany
any
relief

He
see
it
,
and
they
part
in
silence

<EOS>
Philip
's
sense
of
the

be

complete

him
not

with
glance
fear

he
have
be
intervene
too
presumptuously
in
the
action
of
Maggie

conscience

perhaps
for
a
selfish
end

<EOS>
but
no

<EOS>
he
persuade
himself
his
end
be
not
selfish

<EOS>
He
have
little
hope
that
Maggie
would
ever
return
the
strong
feeling
he
have
for
her
;
and
it
must
be
well
for
Maggie
's
future
life
,
when
these
petty
family
obstacle
to
her
freedom
have
disappear
,
that
the
present
should
not
be
entirely
sacrifice
,
and
that
she
should
have
some
opportunity
of
culture
,
 
<EOS>
some
interchange
with
a
mind
above
the
vulgar
level
of
those
she
be
now
condemn
to
live
with

<EOS>
if
we
only
look
far
enough
off
for
the
consequence
of
our
action
,
we
can
always
find
some
point
in
the
combination
of
result
by
which
those
action
can
be
justify
;
by
adopt
the
point
of
view
of
a
Providence
who
arrange
result
,
or
of
a
philosopher
who
trace
them
,
we
shall
find
it
possible
to
obtain
perfect
complacency
in
choose
to
do
what
be
most
agreeable
to
us
in
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
in
this
way
that
Philip
justify
his
subtle
effort
to
overcome
Maggie
's
true
prompting
against
a
concealment
that
would
introduce
doubleness
into
her
own
mind
,
and
may
cause
new
misery
to
those
who
have
the
primary
natural
claim
on
her
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
surplus
of
passion
in
him
that
make
him
half
independent
of
justify
motive
.
<EOS>
His
longing
to
see
Maggie
,
and
make
an
element
in
her
life
,
have
in
it
some
of
that
savage
impulse
to
snatch
an
offer
joy
which
spring
from
a
life
in
which
the
mental
and
bodily
constitution
have
make
pain
predominate
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
his
full
share
in
the
common
good
of
man
;
he
could
not
even
pass
muster
with
the
insignificant
,
but
must
be
single
out
for
pity
,
and
except
from
what
be
a
matter
of
course
with
other
.
<EOS>
even
to
Maggie
he
be
an
exception
;
it
be
clear
that
the
thought
of
his
be
her
lover
have
never
enter
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
do
not
think
too
hardly
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
ugly
and
deform
people
have
great
need
of
unusual
virtue
,
because
they
be
likely
to
be
extremely
uncomfortable
without
them
;
but
the
theory
that
unusual
virtue
spring
by
a
direct
consequence
out
of
personal
disadvantage
,
as
animal
get
thick
wool
in
severe
climate
,
be
perhaps
a
little
overstrained
.
<EOS>
the
temptation
of
beauty
be
much
dwelt
upon
,
but
I
fancy
they
only
bear
the
same
relation
to
those
of
ugliness
,
as
the
temptation
to
excess
at
a
feast
,
where
the
delight
be
varied
for
eye
and
ear
as
well
as
palate
,
bear
to
the
temptation
that
assail
the
desperation
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
do
not
the
Hunger
Tower
stand
as
the
type
of
the
utmost
trial
to
what
be
human
in
us
?
  
<EOS>
Philip
have
never
be
soothe
by
that
mother
's
love
which
flow
out
to
us
in
the
great
abundance
because
our
need
be
great
,
which
cling
to
us
the
more
tenderly
because
we
be
the
less
likely
to
be
winner
in
the
game
of
life
;
and
the
sense
of
his
father
's
affection
and
indulgence
toward
him
be
mar
by
the
keener
perception
of
his
father
's
fault
.
<EOS>
keep
aloof
from
all
practical
life
as
Philip
have
be
,
and
by
nature
half
feminine
in
sensitiveness
,
he
have
some
of
the
woman
's
intolerant
repulsion
toward
worldliness
and
the
deliberate
pursuit
of
sensual
enjoyment
;
and
this
one
strong
natural
tie
in
his
life
,
 
his
relation
as
a
son
,
 
be
like
an
ache
limb
to
him
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
inevitably
something
morbid
in
a
human
being
who
be
in
any
way
unfavorably
except
from
ordinary
condition
,
until
the
good
force
have
have
time
to
triumph
;
and
it
have
rarely
have
time
for
that
at
two
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
that
force
be
present
in
Philip
in
much
strength
,
but
the
sun
himself
look
feeble
through
the
morning
mist
.

it
be
early
afternoon

not
evening

the
edge
of
sharpness

make
her
draw
her
large

close
about
her

trip
along
rather
quickly

she
look

I
shut
it
up

and
determine

<EOS>
I
foresaw
that
that
light

complexioned
girl
would
win
away
all
the
love
from
Corinne

make
her
miserable

<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
read
no
more

where
the
blond

haired
woman
carry
away
all
the

<EOS>
I
should
begin

you

<EOS>

well

perhaps
you
will
avenge
the
dark
woman
in
your
own
person

and
carry
away
all
the
love
from
your
cousin
Lucy

have
some

.

with

with

whether

that

He
may
be

disagreeable

I
never

Maggie

be

who

nothing

Philip
pause
with
a
pang
of
dread
lest
his
confession
should
cut
short
this
very
happiness

a
pang
of
the

dread

manner
this
morning

indifferent

she
be
not

indifferent
now

<EOS>
strike
with
the
unusual
emotion
in
Philip

tone
,
she
have
turn
quickly
to
look
at
him
;
and
as
he
go
on
speak
,
a
great
change
come
over
her
face
,
 
a
flush
and
slight
spasm
of
the
feature
,
such
as
we
see
in
people
who
hear
some
news
that
will
require
them
to
readjust
their
conception

silent

on

Maggie
to
say
something

be
so
surprised

himself
by

pause
a

it

be
well

It

no

look

what

They

Maggie

indeed
,
be
hurry
along

for
she
feel
it
time
to
be
go

<EOS>
but
the
sense
that
their
parting
be
near
make
her
more
anxious
lest
she
should
have
unintentionally
leave
some
painful
impression
on
Philip

<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
dangerous
moment
when

sincere

deceptive

when

rise
high
above
its

leave

<EOS>
Maggie
smile
,
with
glisten
tear

and
then
stoop
her
tall
head
to
kiss
the
pale
face
that
be
full
of
pleading
,
timid
love
,
 
like
a
woman
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
a
moment
of
real
happiness
then
,
 
a
moment
of
belief
that
,
if
there
be
sacrifice
in
this
love
,
it
be
all
the
rich
and
more
satisfying
.
  
<EOS>
She
turn
away
and
hurried
home
,
feel
that
in
the
hour
since
she
have
trodden
this
road
before
,
a
new
era
have
begin
for
her
.
<EOS>
the
tissue
of
vague
dream
must
now
get
narrow
and
narrow
,
and
all
the
thread
of
thought
and
emotion
be
gradually
absorb
in
the
woof
of
her
actual
daily
life
.
    
<EOS>
the
Cloven
Tree
  
secret
be
rarely
betray
or
discover
accord
to
any
programme
our
fear
have
sketch
out
.
<EOS>
fear
be
almost
always
haunt
by
terrible
dramatic
scene
,
which
recur
in
spite
of
the
best
-
argue
probability
against
them
;
and
during
a
year
that
Maggie
have
have
the
burthen
of
concealment
on
her
mind
,
the
possibility
of
discovery
have
continually
present
itself
under
the
form
of
a
sudden
meeting
with
her
father
or
Tom
when
she
be
walk
with
Philip
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
She
be
aware
that
this
be
not
one
of
the
most
likely
event
;
but
it
be
the
scene
that
most
completely
symbolize
her
inward
dread
.
<EOS>
those
slight
indirect
suggestion
which
be
dependent
on
apparently
trivial
coincidence
and
incalculable
state
of
mind
,
be
the
favorite
machinery
of
fact
,
but
be
not
the
stuff
in
which
imagination
be
apt
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
one
of
the
person
about
whom
Maggie
's
fear
be
furth
from
trouble
themselves
be
her
aunt
Pullet
,
on
whom
,
see
that
she
do
not
live
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
be
neither
sharp
-
eyed
nor
sharp
-
temper
,
it
would
surely
have
be
quite
whimsical
of
them
to
fix
rather
than
on
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
channel
of
fatality
 
<EOS>
the
pathway
of
the
lightning
 
be
no
other
than
aunt
Pullet
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
live
at
St.
Ogg

,
but
the
road
from
Garum
Firs
lie
by
the
Red
Deeps
,
at
the
end
opposite
that
by
which
Maggie
enter
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
after
Maggie
's
last
meeting
with
Philip
,
be
a
Sunday
on
which
Mr.
Pullet
be
bind
to
appear
in
funeral
hatband
and
scarf
at
St.

church
,
Mrs.
Pullet
make
this
the
occasion
of
dining
with
sister
Glegg
,
and
take
tea
with
poor
sister
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
Sunday
be
the
one
day
in
the
week
on
which
Tom
be
at
home
in
the
afternoon
;
and
today
the
bright
spirit
he
have
be
in
of
late
have
flow
over
in
unusually
cheerful
open
chat
with
his
father
,
and
in
the
invitation
,
"
come
,
Magsie
,
you
come
too
!
"
<EOS>
when
he
stroll
out
with
his
mother
in
the
garden
to
see
the
advance
cherry
-
blossom
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
better
pleased
with
Maggie
since
she
have
be
less
odd
and
ascetic
;
he
be
even
get
rather
proud
of
her
;
several
person
have
remark
in
his
hearing
that
his
sister
be
a
very
fine
girl
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
there
be
a
peculiar
brightness
in
her
face
,
due
in
reality
to
an
undercurrent
of
excitement
,
which
have
as
much
doubt
and
pain
as
pleasure
in
it
;
but
it
may
pass
for
a
sign
of
happiness

"
You

<EOS>
this
wide
statement
,
by
which
Mrs.
Pullet
represent
the
fact
that
she
have
twice
see
Philip
at
the
spot
indicate
,
produce
an
effect
on
Maggie
which
be
all
the
strong
because
Tom
sate
opposite
her
,
and
she
be
intensely
anxious
to
look
indifferent
.
<EOS>
at
Philip
's
name
she
have
blush
,
and
the
blush
deepen
every
instant
from
consciousness
,
until
the
mention
of
the
Red
Deeps
make
her
feel
as
if
the
whole
secret
be
betray
,
and
she
dare
not
even
hold
her
tea
-
spoon
lest
she
should
show
how
she
tremble
.
<EOS>
She
sit
with
her
hand
clasp
under
the
table
,
not
daring
to
look
round
.
<EOS>
happily
,
her
father
be
seat
on
the
same
side
with
herself
,
beyond
her
uncle
Pullet
,
and
could
not
see
her
face
without
stoop
forward
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
voice
bring
the
first
relief
,
turn
the
conversation
;
for
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
always
alarm
when
the
name
of
Wakem
be
mention
in
her
husband
's
presence
.
<EOS>
gradually
Maggie
recover
composure
enough
to
look
up
;
her
eye
meet
Tom
's
,
but
he
turn
away
his
head
immediately
;
and
she
go
to
bed
that
night
wonder
if
he
have
gather
any
suspicion
from
her
confusion
.
<EOS>
perhaps
not
;
perhaps
he
would
think
it
be
only
her
alarm
at
her
aunt
's
mention
of
Wakem
before
her
father
;
that
be
the
interpretation
her
mother
have
put
in
it
.
<EOS>
to
her
father
,
Wakem
be
like
a
disfigure
disease
,
of
which
he
be
oblige
to
endure
the
consciousness
,
but
be
exasperate
to
have
the
existence
recognize
by
other
;
and
no
amount
of
sensitiveness
in
her
about
her
father
could
be
surprising
,
Maggie
think
.
  
<EOS>
but
Tom
be
too
keen
-
sight
to
rest
satisfied
with
such
an
interpretation
;
he
have
see
clearly
enough
that
there
be
something
distinct
from
anxiety
about
her
father
in
Maggie
's
excessive
confusion
.
<EOS>
in
try
to
recall
all
the
detail
that
could
give
shape
to
his
suspicion
,
he
remember
only
lately
hear
his
mother
scold
Maggie
for
walk
in
the
Red
deep
when
the
ground
be
wet
,
and
bring
home
shoe
clog
with
red
soil
;
<EOS>
still
Tom
,
retain
all
his
old
repulsion
for
Philip
's
deformity
,
shrink
from
attribute
to
his
sister
the
probability
of
feel
more
than
a
friendly
interest
in
such
an
unfortunate
exception
to
the
common
run

submission

<EOS>
Tom

his
terrible

dread

the
character
he
have
give

her
conduct

yet
her
whole
soul
rebel
against
it
as
unfair
from
its
incompleteness

He
,
meanwhile
,
feel
the
impetus

his
indignation
divert
toward
Philip

<EOS>
He
do
not
know
how
much
of
an
old
boyish
repulsion

of
mere
personal
pride

animosity
be
concern
in
the
bitter
severity

Tom

only
hope

prevent

there
would

delay

then
she
may
get
Tom

permission
to
write
to
him

Her
heart
beat
with
double
violence
when
they
get
under
the
Scotch
fir

It
be
the
last
moment
of
suspense

she
think

Philip
always
meet
her
soon
after

beyond

they

across
the
more
open
green
space

enter
the

bushy
path
by
the
mound

another
turning

they
come
so
close
upon

there

a
moment

silence

Philip
dart
a
look
of
inquiry
at
Maggie

face

<EOS>
He
see
an
answer
there
,
in
the
pale
,
parted
lip

the
terrified
tension
of

large
eye

Her
imagination

always
rush
extravagantly
beyond

immediate
impression

see
her
tall

strong
brother
grasp
the
feeble
Philip
bodily
,
crush
him

trample
on
him

in

when

come
the
recollection

great
conquest

win
a
lasting

on
serene
height
above
worldly
temptation

conflict

and
here
she
be
down
again
in
the
thick
of
a
hot
strife
with
her
own

<EOS>
life

short

there
be
more
struggle
for

perhaps
more
fall

<EOS>
if
she
have
feel
that
she
be
entirely
wrong

and
that
Tom
have
be
entirely
right
,
she
could
sooner
have
recover
more
inward
harmony
;

now
her
penitence
and
submission
be
constantly
obstruct
by
resentment
that
would
present
itself
to
her
<EOS>
no
otherwise
than
as
a
just
indignation

<EOS>
Her
heart
bleed
for
Philip

she
go
on
recall
the
insult
that
have
be
fling
at
him
with
so
vivid
a
conception
of
what
he
have
feel
under
them
,
that
it
be
almost
like
a
sharp
bodily
pain
to
her
,
make
her
beat
the
floor
with
her
foot
and
tighten
her
finger
on
her

<EOS>
and
yet
,
how
be
it
that
she
be
now
and
then
conscious
of
a
certain
dim
background
of
relief
in
the
force
separation
from
Philip

<EOS>
surely
it

only
because
the

earlier

evening

as

over
the
bridge

he
look
with
the
old
deep

root
affection
at
the
respectable
red
brick
house

seem
cheerful

inviting

pleasant
light
in

at
the
house

window
;
that
fold
in
his
brow

it
be
not
unbecoming

it
seem
to
imply
a
strength
of
will
that
may
possibly
be
without
harshness
,
when
the
eye
and
mouth
have
their
gentle
expression
.
<EOS>
His
firm
step
become
quick
,
and
the
corner
of
his
mouth
rebel
against
the
compression
which

forbid
a

<EOS>
the
eye
in

<EOS>
hardly
a

look

between

and

his

incommunicativeness
at

from

she
carry
away

<EOS>
the
feeling

Tom

to

He

He
look
up
in

querulous
desire
for
some
assurance

"

His

<EOS>
Tom
never
live
to
taste
another
moment
so
delicious
as
that
;
and
Maggie
could
not
help
forget
her
own
grievance
.
<EOS>
Tom
_
be
_
good
;
and
in
the
sweet
humility
that
spring
in
us
all
in
moment
of
true
admiration
and
gratitude
,
she
feel
that
the
fault
he
have
to
pardon
in
her
have
never
be
redeem
,
as
his
fault
be

<EOS>
She
feel
no
jealousy
this
evening
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
seem
to
be
throw
into
the
background
in
her
father
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
much
more
talk
before
bedtime
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
naturally
want
to
hear
all
the
particular
of
Tom
's
trading
adventure
,
and
he
listen
with
grow
excitement
and
delight
.
<EOS>
He
be
curious
to
know
what
have
be
say
on
every
occasion
;
if
possible
,
what
have
be
think
;
and
Bob
Jakin
's
part
in
the
business
throw
him
into
peculiar
outburst
of
sympathy
with
the
triumphant
knowingness
of
that
remarkable
packman
.
<EOS>
Bob
's
juvenile
history
,
so
far
as
it
have
come
under
Mr.
Tulliver
's
knowledge
,
be
recall
with
that
sense
of
astonish
promise
it
display
,
which
be
observable
in
all
reminiscence
of
the
childhood
of
great
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
there
be
this
interest
of
narrative
to
keep
under
the
vague
but
fierce
sense
of
triumph
over
Wakem
,
<EOS>
which
would
otherwise
have
be
the
channel
his
joy
would
have
rush
into
with
dangerous
force
.
<EOS>
even
as
it
be
,
that
feel
from
time
to
time
give
threat
of
its
ultimate
mastery
,
in
sudden
burst
of
irrelevant
exclamation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
long
before
Mr.
Tulliver
get
to
sleep
that
night
;
and
the
sleep
,
when
it
come
,
be
fill
with
vivid
dream
.
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
already
rise
,
he
alarm
her
by
start
up
with
a
sort
of
smothered
shout
,
and
look
round
in
a
bewilder
way
at
the
wall
of
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
Mr.
Tulliver
?
"
say
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
,
still
with
a
puzzle
expression
,
and
say
at
last
:
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
dream
 
<EOS>
do
I
make
a
noise
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
would
get
hold
of
him
.
"
    
<EOS>
a
Day
of
Reckoning
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tulliver
be
an
essentially
sober
man
,
 
able
to
take
his
glass
and
not
averse
to
it
,
but
never
exceed
the
bound
of
moderation
.
<EOS>
He
have
naturally
an
active
Hotspur
temperament
,
which
do
not
crave
liquid
fire
to
set
it
aglow
;
his
impetuosity
be
usually
equal
to
an
exciting
occasion
without
any
such
reinforcement
;
and
his
desire
for
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
imply
that
the
too
sudden
joy
have
fall
with
a
dangerous
shock
on
a
frame
depress
by
four
year
of
gloom
and
unaccustomed
hard
fare
.
<EOS>
but
that
first
doubtful
tottering
moment
pass
,
he
seem
to
gather
strength
with
his
gathering
excitement
;
and
the
next
day
,
when
he
be
seat
at
table
with
his
creditor
,
his
eye
kindle
and
his
cheek
flush
with
the
consciousness
that
he
be
about
to
make
an
honorable
figure
once
more
,
he
look
more
like
the
proud
,
confident
,
warm
-
hearted
,
and
warm
-
tempered
Tulliver
of
old
time
than
may
have
seem
possible
to
any
one
who
have
meet
him
a
week
before
,
ride
along
as
have
be
his
will
not
for
the
last
four
year
<EOS>
since
the
sense
of
failure
and
debt
have
be
upon
him
,
 
with
his
head
hang
down
,
cast
brief
,
unwilling
look
on
those
who
force
themselves
on
his
notice
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
speech
,
assert
his
honest
principle
with
his
old
confident
eagerness
,
allude
to
the
rascal
and
the
luck
that
have
be
against
him
,
but
that
he
have
triumph
over
,
to
some
extent
,
by
hard
effort
and
the
aid
of
a
good
son
;
and
wind
up
with
the
story
of
how
Tom
have
get
the
good
part
of
the
needful
money
.
<EOS>
but
the
streak
of
irritation
and
hostile
triumph
seem
to
melt
for
a
little
while
into
purer
fatherly
pride
and
pleasure
,
when
,
Tom
's
health
have
be
propose
,
and
uncle
Deane
have
take
occasion
to
say
a
few
word
of
eulogy
on
his
general
character
and
conduct
,
Tom
himself
get
up
and
make
the
single
speech
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
It
could
hardly
have
be
briefer
.
<EOS>
He
thank
the
gentleman
for
the
honor
they
have
do
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
glad
that
he
have
be
able
to
help
his
father
in
prove
his
integrity
and
regain
his
honest
name
;
and
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
hope
he
should
never
undo
that
work
and
disgrace
that
name
.
<EOS>
but
the
applause
that
follow
be
so
great
,
and
Tom
look
so
gentlemanly
as
well
as
tall
and
straight
,
that
Mr.
Tulliver
remark
,
in
an
explanatory
manner
,
to
his
friend
on
his
right
and
leave
,
that
he
have
spend
a
deal
of
money
on
his
son
's
education
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
break
up
in
very
sober
fashion
at
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Tom
remain
in
St.
Ogg
's
to
attend
to
some
business
,
and
Mr.
Tulliver
mount
his
horse
to
go
home
,
and
describe
the
memorable
thing
that
have
be
say
and
do
,
to
"
poor
Bessy
and
the
little
wench
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
air
of
excitement
that
hang
about
him
be
but
faintly
due
to
good
cheer
or
any
stimulus
but
the
potent
wine
of
triumphant
joy
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
choose
any
back
street
to
-
day
,
but
ride
slowly
,
with
uplifted
head
and
free
glance
,
along
the
principal
street
all
the
way
to
the
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
why
do
he
not
happen
to
meet
Wakem
?
<EOS>
the
want
of
that
coincidence
vex
him
,
and
set
his
mind
at
work
in
an
irritating
way
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Wakem
be
go
out
of
town
to
-
day
on
purpose
to
avoid
see
or
hear
anything
of
an
honorable
action
which
may
well
cause
him
some
unpleasant
twinge
.
<EOS>
if
Wakem
be
to
meet
him
then
,
Mr.
Tulliver
would
look
straight
at
him
,
and
the
rascal
would
perhaps
be
forsake
a
little
by
his
cool
,
domineering
impudence
.
<EOS>
He
would
know
by
and
by
that
an
honest
man
be
not
go
to
serve
_
him
<EOS>
_
any
longer
,
and
lend
his
honesty
to
fill
a
pocket
already
over
-
full
of
dishonest
gain
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
luck
be
begin
to
turn
;
perhaps
the
Devil
do
not
always
hold
the
good
card
in
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
simmer
in
this
way
,
Mr.
Tulliver
approach
the
yardgate
of
Dorlcote
Mill
,
near
enough
to
see
a
well
-
know
figure
come
out
of
them
on
a
fine
black
horse
.
<EOS>
They
meet
about
fifty
yard
from
the
gate
,
between
the
great
chestnut
and
elm
and
the
high
bank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tulliver
,
"
say
Wakem
,
abruptly
,
in
a
haughty
tone
than
usual
,
"
what

Mr.

spur
his

make
a
rush
forward
;
and
Wakem

horse
,
rear
and
stagger
backward
,
throw
his

from

him
sideways
on

<EOS>
Wakem
have
have
the
presence

mind
to
loose
the
bridle
at
once

and
as
the
horse
only

a
few
pace
and
then
stand
still
,
he
may
have
rise
and
remount
without
more
inconvenience
than
a
bruise
and
a
shake
.
<EOS>
but
before
he
could
rise
,
Tulliver
be
off
his
horse
too
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
the
long

hate
predominant
man
down
,
and
in
his
power
,
throw
him
into
a
frenzy
of
triumphant
vengeance
,
which
seem
to
give
him
preternatural
agility
and
strength
.
<EOS>
He
rush
on
Wakem
,
who
be
in
the
act

try
to
recover
his

grasp
him
by

fiercely
across

see
that

burst
into
hysteric

while
poor

He

"

Mrs.

He
seem
to
be

suffer
to
hear

;
but
presently
,
when
she
say
to
Maggie
,
"

seek

"
he
look

<EOS>
Sad
end
to
the
day
that
have
rise
on
them
all
like
a
beginning
of
well
time
!
<EOS>
but
mingle
seed
must
bear
a
mingle
crop
.
  
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
after
his
father
have
lain
down
Tom
come
home
.
<EOS>
Bob
Jakin
be
with
him
,
come
to
congratulate
"
the
old
master
,
"
not
without
some
excusable
pride
that
he
have
have
his
share
in
bring
about
Mr.
Tom
's
good
luck
;
and
Tom
have
think
his
father
would
like
nothing
better
,
as
a
finish
to
the
day
,
than
a
talk
with
Bob
.
<EOS>
but
now
Tom
could
only
spend
the
evening
in
gloomy
expectation
of
the
unpleasant
consequence
that
must
follow
on
this
mad
outbreak
of
his
father
's
long
-
smothered
hate
.
<EOS>
after
the
painful
news
have
be
tell
,
he
sit
in
silence
;
he
have
not
spirit
or
inclination
to
tell
his
mother
and
sister
anything
about
the
dinner
;
they
hardly
care
to
ask
it
.
<EOS>
apparently
the
mingled
thread
in
the
web
of
their
life
be
so
curiously
twist
together
that
there
could
be
no
joy
without
a
sorrow
come
close
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
deject
by
the
thought
that
his
exemplary
effort
must
always
be
baffle
by
the
wrong
-
doing
of
other
;
Maggie
be
live
through
,
over
and
over
again
,
the
agony
of
the
moment
in
which
she
have
rush
to
throw
herself
on
her
father
's
arm
,
with
a
vague
,
shudder
forebode
of
wretched
scene
to
come
.
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
three
feel
any
particular
alarm
about
Mr.
Tulliver
's
health
;
the
symptom
do
not
recall
his
former
dangerous
attack
,
and
it
seem
only
a
necessary
consequence
that
his
violent
passion
and
effort
of
strength
,
after
many
hour
of
unusual
excitement
,
should
have
make
him
feel
ill
.
<EOS>
rest
would
probably
cure
him
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
tire
out
by
his
active
day
,
fall
asleep
soon
,
and
sleep
soundly
;
it
seem
to
him
as
if
he
have
only
just
come
to
bed
,
when
he
wake
to
see
his
mother
stand
by
him
in
the
gray
light
of
early
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
My

He

Maggie
and
Tom
throw
on
their
clothe
hastily
in
the
chill
gray
light
,
and
reach
their
father
's
room
almost
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
He
be
watch
for
them
with
an
expression
of
pain
on
his
brow
,
but
with
sharpened

anxious
consciousness
in
his
eye

<EOS>
Mrs.
Tulliver
stand
at

foot

frightened

the

the

turn
his

with

eager

,
while

,
with
a

He
look
away

all
when

have
say
this

and
lie
silent
for
some
minute
,
while

stand

not

<EOS>
the
morning
light

grow
clear
for

and
they
could
see
the
heaviness
gather
in
his

and
the
dulness
in

but
at

His

apparent
triviality

perceive
at

be
a
design
in
it
which
make
it
eminently
worthy
of

headed

for
you
see
that
Lucy
want
the
scissor

be
compel

reluctant

she
may
be

to
shake
her
ringlet

her
soft
hazel
eye

smile
playfully
down
on

very
nearly
on

out

It

there
be
very
painful
circumstance

I
believe

I
never

My

be
unfortunate

his

I

he
consider
Mr.

be
somehow
the
cause

it

Mr.

buy
Dorlcote
Mill
,
my

remember

you

no

rather
supercilious
indifference

I
have
always
know

I
dare
say
I
know
the
man
by
sight

apart

his
name

I
know
half
the
name

face

disjoint
way

He
be
a
very
hot

tempered
man

<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
I
be
a
little
girl

use
to
go
to
see
my
cousin

he
often
frighten
me
by
talk

if
he
be
angry

Papa
tell
me
there
be
a
dreadful
quarrel
,
the
very
day
before
my
uncle
's
death

between
him
and
Mr.
Wakem
,

it
be
hush
up
.
<EOS>
that
be
when
you
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
Papa
say
my
uncle
be
quite
mistaken
in
many
way
;
his
mind
have
become
embitter
.
<EOS>
but
Tom
and
Maggie
must
naturally
feel
it
very
painful
to
be
remind
of
these
thing
.
<EOS>
They
have
have
so
much
,
so
very
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
Maggie
be
at
school
with
me
six
year
ago
,
when
she
be
fetch
away
because
of
her
father
's
misfortune
,
and
she
have
hardly
have
any
pleasure
since
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
in
a
dreary
situation
in
a
school
since
uncle
's
death
,
because
she
be
determined
to
be
independent
,
and
not
live
with
aunt
Pullet
;
and
I
could
hardly
wish
her
to
come
to
me
then
,
because
dear
mamma
be
ill
,
and
everything
be
so
sad
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
I
want
her
to
come
to
me
now
,
and
have
a
long
,
long
holiday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
sweet
and
angelic
of
you
,
"
say
Stephen
,
look
at
her
with
an
admire
smile
;
"
and
all
the
more
so
if
she
have
the
conversational
quality
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
aunty
!

You
be
cruel
to
ridicule
her

She
be
very
valuable
to

me

<EOS>
,
I
know

<EOS>
She
manage
the
house
beautifully
,
 
much
well
than
any
stranger
would
,

she
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
in
mamma
's
illness
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
in
point
of
companionship
one
would
prefer
that
she
should
be
represent
by
her
brandy
-
cherry
and
cream
-
cake
.
<EOS>
I
think
with
a
shudder
that
her
daughter
will
always
be
present
in
person
,
and
have
no
agreeable
proxy
of
that
kind
,
 
a
fat
,
blond
girl
,
with
round
blue
eye
,
who
will
stare
at
us
silently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
"
exclaim
Lucy
,
laugh
wickedly

clap
her

that
be
just
my
cousin
Maggie

<EOS>

must
have
see
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
;
I
be
only
guess
what
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
daughter
must
be
;
and
then
if
she
be
to
banish
Philip

our
only
apology
for
a
tenor
,
that
will
be
an
additional
bore

"
  
<EOS>

I
hope
that
may
not
be

<EOS>
I
think
I
will
ask
you
to
call
on
Philip
and
tell
him
Maggie
be
come
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
aware
of
Tom
's
feeling
,
and
always
keep
out
of
his
way
;
so
he
will
understand
,
if
you
tell
him

that
I
ask
you
to
warn
him
not
to
come
until
I
write
to
ask
him

<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
better
write
a
pretty
note
for
me
to
take
;
Phil
be
so
sensitive
,
you
know
,
the
least
thing
may
frighten
him
off
come
at
all
,
and
we
have
hard
work
to
get
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
induce
him
to
come
to
the
park
;
he
do
not
like
my
sister
,
I
think
.

It
be
only
your
faëry
touch
that
can
lay
his
ruffled
feather

<EOS>
Stephen
master
the
little
hand
that
be
stray
toward
the
table

touch
it
lightly
with
his
lip

<EOS>
little
Lucy
feel
very
proud

happy

She
and
Stephen
be
in
that
stage
of
courtship
which
make
the
most
exquisite
moment
of
youth
,
the
fresh
blossom
-
time
of
passion
,
 
when
each
be
sure
of
the
other
's
love
,
but
no
formal
declaration
have
be
make
,
and
all
be
mutual
divination
,
exalt
the
most
trivial
word
,
the
light
gesture
,
into
thrill
delicate
and
delicious
as
waft
jasmine
scent

<EOS>
the
explicitness
of
an
engagement
wear
off
this
fine
edge

susceptibility

it
be
jasmine
gather
and
present
in
a
large
bouquet

it

really
odd

cunning
Lucy

something

home

marvellous

accord
of
descend
third
and
fifth
,
from
the
preconcerte
loving
chase
of
a
fugue
,
be
likely
enough
to
supersede
any
immediate
demand
for
less
impassioned
form
of
agreement

<EOS>
the
contralto
will
not
care
to
catechise
the
bass
;
the
tenor
will
foresee
no
embarrassing
dearth
of
remark
in
evening
spend
with
the
lovely
soprano
.
<EOS>
in
the
province
,
too
,
where
music
be
so
scarce
in
that
remote
time
,
how
could
the
musical
people
avoid
fall
in
love
with
each
other
?
<EOS>
even
political
principle
must
have
be
in
danger
of
relaxation
under
such
circumstance
;
and
the
violin
,
faithful
to
rotten
borough
,
must
have
be
tempt
to
fraternize
in
a
demoralizing
way
with
a
reform
violoncello
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
the
linnet
-
throate
soprano

the
full
-
toned
bass
singing
,
      
"
with
thee
delight

ever
new

with
thee
be
life
incessant

they

it

now
for
Raphael

great
song

Lucy

the
duet

You

this

"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
deliver
with
admirable
ease
the
deep
note
represent
the
tread
of
the
heavy
beast
;
but
when
a
singer
have
an
audience
of
two
,
there
be
room
for
divide
sentiment
.
<EOS>
Minny
's
mistress
be
charm
;
but
Minny
,
who
have
intrench
himself
,
tremble
,
in
his
basket
as
soon
as
the
music
begin
,
find
this
thunder
so
little
to
his
taste
that
he
leap
out
and
scamper
under
the
remotest
_
chiffonnier
_
,
as
the
most
eligible
place
in
which
a
small
dog
could
await
the
crack
of
doom

<EOS>
"
adieu
,
"
graceful
consort
,
"
"
say
Stephen
,
button
his
coat
across
when
he
have
do
singing
,
and
smile
down
from
his
tall
height
,
with
the
air
of
rather
a
patronizing
lover
,
at
the
little
lady
on
the
music
-
stool
.
<EOS>
"
My
bliss
be
not
incessant

for
I

home

there
at

"
  
<EOS>
"
You

not

able
to
call
on
Philip

<EOS>
It

yes

we

go
to

a

party

<EOS>
My

Tom
will
dine
with
us
;
and
poor
aunty
will
have
her
two
child
together
for
the
first
time

It
will
be
very
pretty
;
I

a

<EOS>

I
may
come
the
next
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
come
and
be
introduce
to
my
cousin
Maggie
;
though
you
can
hardly
be
say
not
to
have
see
her
,
you
have
describe
her
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
then
.
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
that
slight
pressure
of
the
hand
,
and
momentary
meeting
of
the
eye
,
which
will
often
leave
a
little
lady
with
a
slight
flush
and
smile
on
her
face
that
do
not
subside
immediately
when
the
door
be
closed
,
and
with
an
inclination
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
rather
than
to
seat
herself
quietly
at
her
embroidery
,
or
other
rational
and
improve
occupation
.
<EOS>
at
least
this
be
the
effect
on
Lucy
;
and
you
will
not
,
I
hope
,
consider
it
an
indication
of
vanity
predominate
over
more
tender
impulse
,
that
she
just
glance
in
the
chimney
-
glass
as
her
walk
bring
her
near
it
.
<EOS>
the
desire
to
know
that
one
have
not
look
an
absolute
fright
during
a
few
hour
of
conversation
may
be
construe
as
lie
within
the
bound
of
a
laudable
benevolent
consideration
for
other
.
<EOS>
and
Lucy
have
so
much
of
this
benevolence
in
her
nature
that
I
be
inclined
to
think
her
small
egoism
be
impregnate
with
it
,
just
as
there
be
people
not
altogether
unknown
to
you
whose
small
benevolence
have
a
predominant
and
somewhat
rank
odor
of
egoism
.
<EOS>
even
now
,
that
she
be
walk
up
and
down
with
a
little
triumphant
flutter
of
her
girlish
heart
at
the
sense
that
she
be
love
by
the
person
of
chief
consequence
in
her
small
world
,
you
may
see
in
her
hazel
eye
an
ever
-
present
sunny
benignity
,
in
which
the
momentary
harmless
flash
of
personal
vanity
be
quite
lost
;
and
if
she
be
happy
in
thinking
of
her
lover
,
it
be
because
the
thought
of
him
mingle
readily
with
all
the
gentle
affection
and
good
-
natured
office
with
which
she
fill
her
peaceful
day
.
<EOS>
even
now
,
her
mind
,
with
that
instantaneous
alternation
which
make
two
current
of
feeling
or
imagination
seem
simultaneous
,
be
glance
continually
from
Stephen
to
the
preparation
she
have
only
half
finish
in
Maggie
's
room
.
<EOS>
Cousin
Maggie
should
be
treat
as
well
as
the
grand
lady
-
visitor
,
 
nay
,
well
,
for
she
should
have
Lucy
's
good
print
and
drawing
in
her
bedroom
,
and
the
very
fine
bouquet
of
spring
flower
on
her
table
.
<EOS>
Maggie
would
enjoy
all
that
,
she
be
so
find
of
pretty
thing
!
<EOS>
and
there
be
poor
aunt
Tulliver
,
that
no
one
make
any
account
of
<EOS>
,
she
be
to
be
surprised
with
the
present
of
a
cap
of
superlative
quality
,
and
to
have
her
health
drunk
in
a
gratify
manner
,
for
which
Lucy
be
go
to
lay
a
plot
with
her
father
this
evening
.
<EOS>
clearly
,
she
have
not
time
to
indulge
in
long
reverie
about
her
own
happy
love
-
affair
.
<EOS>
with
this
thought
she
walk
toward
the
door
,
but
pause
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
then
,
Minny
?
"
she
say
,
stoop
in
answer
to
some
whimpering
of
that
small
quadrupe
,
and
lift
his
glossy
head
against
her
pink
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
I
be
go
without
you
?
<EOS>
come
,
then
,
let
us
go
and
see
Sinbad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sinbad
be
Lucy
's
chestnut
horse
,
that
she
always
feed
with
her
own
hand
when
he
be
turn
out
in
the
paddock

<EOS>
She
be
fond
of
feed
dependent
creature
,
and
know
the
private
taste
of
all
the
animal
about
the
house
,
delight
in
the
little
rippling
sound
of
her
canary
when
their
beak
be
busy
with
fresh
seed
,
and
in
the
small
nibbling
pleasure
of
certain
animal
which
,
lest
she
should
appear
too
trivial
,
I
will
here
call
"
the
more
familiar
rodent
.
<EOS>
"
  
be
not
Stephen
Guest
right
in
his
decide
opinion
that
this
slim
maiden
of
eighteen
be
quite
the
sort
of
wife
a
man
would
not
be
likely
to
repent
of
marrying
,
 
a
woman
who
be
love
and
thoughtful
for
other
woman
,
not
give
them
Judas
-
kiss
with
eye
askance
on
their
welcome
defect
,
but
with
real
care
and
vision
for
their
half
-
hide
pain
and
mortification
,
with
long
ruminating
enjoyment
of
little
pleasure
prepare
for
them
?
<EOS>
perhaps
the
emphasis
of
his
admiration
do
not
fall
precisely
on
this
rare
quality
in
her
;
perhaps
he
approve
his
own
choice
of
her
chiefly
because
she
do
not
strike
him
as
a
remarkable
rarity
.
<EOS>
a
man
like
his
wife
to
be
pretty
;
well
,
Lucy
be
pretty
,
but
not
to
a
maddening
extent
.
<EOS>
a
man
like
his
wife
to
be
accomplish
,
gentle
,
affectionate
,
and
not
stupid
;
and
Lucy
have
all
these
qualification
.
<EOS>
Stephen
be
not
surprised
to
find
himself
in
love
with
her
,
and
be
conscious
of
excellent
judgment
in
prefer
her
to
Miss
Leyburn
,
the
daughter
of
the
county
member
,
although
Lucy
be
only
the
daughter
of
his
father
's
subordinate
partner
;
besides
,
he
have
have
to
defy
and
overcome
a
slight
unwillingness
and
disappointment
in
his
father
and
sister
,
 
a
circumstance
which
give
a
young
man
an
agreeable
consciousness
of
his
own
dignity
.
<EOS>
Stephen
be
aware
that
he
have
sense
and
independence
enough
to
choose
the
wife
who
be
likely
to
make
him
happy
,
unbiasse
by
any
indirect
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
mean
to
choose
Lucy
;
she
be
a
little
darling
,
and
exactly
the
sort
of
woman
he
have
always
admire
.

First
Impressions

on

at
Maggie

foot

after

that
dark
lady
in

velvet
chair

<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
difficult
to

Maggie
,
smile
,
and
hold
up
one
of
Lucy
's
long
curl
,
that
the
sunlight
may
shine
through
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
gentleman
who
think
he
be
good
enough
for
Lucy
must
expect
to
be
sharply
criticise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
he
be
a
great
deal
too
good
for
me
.
<EOS>
and
sometimes
,
when
he
be
away
,
I
almost
think
it
can
not
really
be
that
he
love
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
never
doubt
it
when
he
be
with
me

though
I
could
not
bear
any
one

you
to
know
that
I
feel
in
that
way

Maggie

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
then
,
if
I
disapprove
of
him
you
can

him
up

you
be
not

"

Maggie

with
playful
gravity

I
would
rather
not

engage

they
begin
to
think
of
be
marry
soon
,
"
say
Lucy
,
too
thoroughly
preoccupied
to
notice
Maggie
's
joke
;
"
and
I
should
like
everything
to
go
on
for
a
long
while
just
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
be
quite
frightened
lest
Stephen
should
say
that
he
have
speak
to
papa
;
and
from
something
that
fall
from
papa
the
other
day
,
I
feel
sure
he
and
Mr.
Guest
be
expect
that
.
<EOS>
and
Stephen
's
sister
be
very
civil
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
I
think
they
do
not
like
his
pay
me
attention
;
and
that
be
natural
.
<EOS>
It
_
do
_
seem
out
of
keep
that
I
should
ever
live
in
a
great
place
like
the
Park
House
,
such
a
little
insignificant
thing
as
I
be
.

<EOS>
"

people
be
not
expect
to
be
large
in
proportion
to
the
house

live
in

Lucy

half
-
penitent
at
this
uncharitable
remark

Lucy
rise
from

go
to
a
little
distance

hold
her
pretty
head
on
one
side
,
as
if

arrange
Maggie
for

down
on
her
slight
,
aerial
cousin

faultless
drapery

silk

crape

her
contemplative
attitude
a
moment

two
in
silence

you
in

what
I

that
old
limp
merino
would
come
back

on

the

rejoice

Tom

<EOS>
memory

urge
upon

a
sense

Her

harder

she

the
image

Lucy
have
look
up
from

work

she
utter
the
last
sentence

see

there
be
a
change
in
Maggie

face

do
it
hurt
you

hear

I

"
I

subject

Maggie

rise
and
go
to
the
window
as
if
she
want
to
see
more
of
the
landscape
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
like
Philip
Wakem
ever
since
I
be
a
little
girl

him
at

He

I
be
very
fond
of
poor
Philip

only
I
wish
he
be
not
so
morbid
about
his
deformity

<EOS>
I
suppose
it

be
_
<EOS>
his
deformity
that
make
him
so
sad
,
and
sometimes
bitter

<EOS>
It

very
piteous

his
poor
little
crooked
body

pale
face

great

strong
people

,

bell

not

faint

<EOS>
one
of
the
thing
I
most
admire
in
Stephen

that
he
make
a
great
friend

any
one

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
for
Maggie
to
speak
now
;
the
drawingroom
door
be
opening

and
Minny
be
already
growl
in
a
small
way
at
the
entrance
of
a
tall
gentleman
,
who
go
up
to
Lucy
and
take
her
hand
with
a
half
-
polite
,
half
-
tender
glance
and
tone
of
inquiry
,
which
seem
to
indicate
that
he
be
unconscious
of
any
other
presence

<EOS>
"
let

introduce
you

turn
with
wicked
enjoyment
toward

who
now
approach
from
the
farth
window

<EOS>
"
this

Mr.
Stephen
Guest

<EOS>
for
one
instant
Stephen
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
this
tall
,
dark
-
eyed
nymph
with
her
jet
-
black
coronet
of
hair
;
the
next
,
Maggie
feel
herself
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
receive
the
tribute
of
a
very
deep
blush
and
a
very
deep
bow
from
a
person
toward
whom
she
herself
be
conscious
of
timidity
.
  
<EOS>
this
new
experience
be
very
agreeable
to
her
,
so
agreeable
that
it
almost
efface
her
previous
emotion
about
Philip
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
new
brightness
in
her
eye
,
and
a
very
become
flush
on
her
cheek
,
as
she
seat
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
perceive
what
a
strike

Lucy

with
a
pretty
laugh
of
triumph

She
enjoy
her
lover

confusion

advantage
be
usually
on
his
side

himself
by

stoop
to
play
with

at

furtively
.

"
<EOS>
She
say
you
have
light
hair

blue
eye

"
  
"
Nay

it

so

find
reality
so
much
more
beautiful

<EOS>
"
now
you
have
prove
yourself
equal

the
occasion

Maggie

say
what
it

incumbent
on
you
to
say
under
the
circumstance

"
  
<EOS>
She
flash
a
slightly
defiant
look
at
him
;
it
be
clear
to
her
that
he
have
be
draw
a
satirical
portrait
of
her
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Lucy
have
say
he
be
incline
to
be
satirical
,
and
Maggie
have
mentally
supply
the
addition
,
"
and
rather
conceited
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
an
alarming
amount

devil

Stephen
's
first
thought

<EOS>
the
second
,
when
she
have
bent
over
her
work

be
,
"
I
wish
she
would
look
at
me
again
.
"
<EOS>
the
next
be
to
answer
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
all
phrase
of
mere
compliment
have
their
turn
to
be
true

<EOS>
a
man
be
occasionally
grateful
when
he
say
"
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
rather
hard
upon
him
that
he
must
use
the
same
word
with
which
all
the
world
decline
a
disagreeable
invitation
,
do
not
you
think
so
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Maggie
,
look
at
him
with
her
direct
glance
;
"
if
we
use
common
word
on
a
great
occasion
,
they
be
the
more
striking
,
because
they
be
feel
at
once
to
have
a
particular
meaning
,
like
old
banner
,
or
every

day
clothe
,
hang
up
in
a
sacred
place

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
my
compliment
ought
to
be
eloquent
,
"
say
Stephen
,
really
not
quite
know
what
he
say
while
Maggie
look
at
him
,
"
see
that
the
word
be
so
far
beneath
the
occasion

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
compliment
can
be
eloquent
,
except
as
an
expression
of
indifference

say
Maggie
,
flush
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
Lucy
be
rather
alarm
;
she
think
Stephen
and
Maggie
be
not
go
to
like
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
fear
lest
Maggie
should
appear
too
old
and
clever
to
please
that
critical
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
dear
Maggie
,
"
she
interpose
,
"
you
have
always
pretend
that
you
be
too
fond
of
be
admire
;
and
now
,
I
think
,
you
be
angry
because
some
one
venture
to
admire
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
say
Maggie
;
"
I
like
too
well

compliment
never
make
me
feel
that

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
pay
you
a
compliment
again
,
Miss

"

Stephen

<EOS>
"
thank
you
;
that
will
be
a
proof

"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
!
<EOS>
She
be
so
unused
to
society
that
she
could
take
nothing
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
have
never
in
her
life
speak
from
the
lip
merely
,
so
that
she
must
necessarily
appear
absurd
to
more
experienced
lady
,
from
the
excessive
feeling
she
be
apt
to
throw
into
very
trivial
incident
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
even
conscious
herself
of
a
little
absurdity
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
she
have
a
theoretic
objection
to
compliment
,
and
have
once
say
impatiently
to
Philip
that
she
do
not
see
why
woman
be
to
be
tell
with
a
simper
that
they
be
beautiful
,
any
more
than
old
man
be
to
be
tell
that
they
be
venerable
;
still
,
to
be
so
irritated
by
a
common
practice
in
the
case
of
a
stranger
like
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
and
to
care
about
his
have
speak
slightingly
of
her
before
he
have
see
her
,
be
certainly
unreasonable
,
and
as
soon
as
she
be
silent
she
begin
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
her
that
her
irritation
be
due
to
the
pleasanter
emotion
which
precede
it
,
just
as
when
we
be
satisfied
with
a
sense
of
glow
warmth
<EOS>
an
innocent
drop
of
cold
water
may
fall
upon
us
as
a
sudden
smart
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
be
too
well
breed
not
to
seem
unaware
that
the
previous
conversation
could
have
be
feel
embarrassing
,
and
at
once
begin
to
talk
of
impersonal

,
ask
Lucy
if
she
know
when
the
bazaar
be
at
length
to
take
place
,
so
that
there
may
be
some
hope
of
see
her
rain
the
influence
of
her
eye
on
object
more
grateful
than
those
worst
flower
that
be

under
her
finger

<EOS>
"
some
day
next
month
,
I
believe
,
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
but
your
sister
be
do
more
for
it
than
I
be
;
they
be
to
have
the
large
stall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
yes
;
but
they
carry
on
their
manufacture
in
their
own
sitting
-
room
,
where
I
do
not
intrude
on
them
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
be
not
addict
to
the
fashionable
vice
of
fancy
-
work
,
Miss
Tulliver
,

Stephen
,
look
at
Maggie
's
plain
hemming

<EOS>
"
no
,
"

Maggie
,
"
I
can
do
nothing
more
difficult
or
more
elegant
than
shirt
-
making
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
your
plain
sewing
be
so
beautiful
,
Maggie
,
"
say
Lucy
,
"
that
I
think
I
shall
beg
a
few
specimen
of
you
to
show
as
fancy
-
work
.
<EOS>
Your
exquisite
sewing
be
quite
a
mystery
to
me

you
use
to
dislike
that
sort
of
work
so
much
in
old
day

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
mystery
easily
explain
,
dear
,
"

Maggie
,
look
up
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
plain
sewing
be
the
only
thing
I
could
get
money
by
,
so
I
be
oblige
to
try
and
do
it
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
,
good
and
simple
as
she
be
,
could
not
help
blush
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
quite
like
that
Stephen
should
know
that
<EOS>
;
Maggie
nee
not
have
mention
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
some
pride
in
the
confession
,
  
the
pride
of
poverty
that
will
not
be
ashamed
of
itself
.
<EOS>
but
if
Maggie
have
be
the
queen
of
coquette
she
could
hardly
have
invent
a
means
of
give
great
piquancy
to
her
beauty
in
Stephen
's
eye
;
I
be
not
sure
that
the
quiet
admission
of
plain
sewing
and
poverty
would
have
do
alone
,
but
assist
by
the
beauty
,
they
make
Maggie
more
unlike
other
woman
even
than
she
have
seem
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
knit
,
Lucy

"
Maggie
go
on

that
will

use

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
of
infinite
use

<EOS>
I
shall
set
you
to
work
with
scarlet
wool
to

morrow

<EOS>
but
your
sister
be
the
most
enviable
person
,
"
continue
Lucy
,
turn
to
Stephen
,
"
to
have
the
talent
of
modelling

<EOS>
She
be
do
a
wonderful
bust
of
Dr.
Kenn
entirely
from
memory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
if
she
can
remember
to
put
the
eye
very
near
together
,
and
the
corner
of
the
mouth
very
far
apart

the
likeness
can
hardly
fail

strike
in
St.

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
that
be
very
wicked
of
you

Lucy

look

I
do
not

you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
anything
disrespectful
of
Dr.
Kenn
?
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
bind
to
respect
a
libellous
bust
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
Kenn
one
of
the
fine
fellow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
much
about
the
tall
candlestick
he
have
put
on
the
communion
-
table
,
and
I
should
not
like
to
spoil
my
temper
by
get
up
to
early
prayer
every
morning
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
the
only
man
I
ever
know
personally
who
seem
to
me
to
have
anything
of
the
real
apostle
in
him
,
 
a
man
who
have
eight
hundred
a
-
year
and
be
content
with
deal
furniture
and
boil
beef
because
he
give
away
two
-
third
of
his
income
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
very
fine
thing
of
him
,
 
take
into
his
house
that
poor
lad
Grattan
,
who
shoot
his
mother
by
accident
.
<EOS>
He
sacrifice
more
time
than
a
less
busy
man
could
spare
,
to
save
the
poor
fellow
from
get
into
a
morbid
state
of
mind
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
lad
out
with
him
constantly
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
beautiful
,

Maggie
,
who
have
let
her
work
fall

with
keen
interest
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
know
any
one
who
do
such
thing

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
one
admire
that
sort
of
action
in
Kenn
all
the
more
,
"
say
Stephen
,
"
because
his
manner
in
general
be
rather
cold

severe

there
be
nothing

maudlin
about
him

oh

I

no

there

you

shake
his

now
,
what
fault

you
point
out
in
him

well

those
be
the
right

that
settle
the
question

Stephen

not
from

parliamentary
point

He
have
set
the
Dissenters

by
the
ear

a
rise
senator

myself

of

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"

Maggie
,
smile
,
but
not

up

so
much
fluency

much
penetration
you
have

Stephen

You
have
discover
already
that
I

talkative

She

I
must
try
other
subject

<EOS>
do
Lucy
intend
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
Book
Club
next
week
?
<EOS>
be
the
next
question
.
<EOS>
then
follow
the
recommendation
to
choose
Southey
's
"
Life
of
Cowper
,
"
unless
she
be
incline
to
be
philosophical
,
and
startle
the
lady
of
St.
Ogg
's
by
vote
for
one
of
the
Bridgewater
Treatises
.
<EOS>
of
course
Lucy
wish
to
know
what
these
alarmingly
learn
book
be
;
and
as
it
be
always
pleasant
to
improve
the
mind
of
lady
by
talk
to
them
at
ease
on
subject
of
which
they
know
nothing
,
Stephen
become
quite
brilliant
in
an
account
of
Buckland
's
Treatise
,
which
he
have
just
be
read
.
<EOS>
He
be
reward
by
see
Maggie
let
her
work
fall
,
and
gradually
get
so
absorb
in
his
wonderful
geological
story
that
she
sit
look
at
him
,
lean
forward
with
cross
arm
,
and
with
an
entire
absence
of
self
-
consciousness
,
as
if
he
have
be
the
snuffiest
of
old
professor
,
and
she
a
downy
-
lip
alumna
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
fascinated
by
the
clear
,
large
gaze
that
at
last
he
forget
to
look
away
from
it
occasionally
toward
Lucy
;
but
she
,
sweet
child
,
be
only
rejoice
that
Stephen
be
prove
to
Maggie
how
clever
he
be
,
and
that
they
would
certainly
be
good
friend
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
bring
you
the
book
,
shall
I
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
"
say
Stephen
,
when
he
find
the
stream
of
his
recollection
run
rather
shallow

there
be
many
illustration
in

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
thank
you

Maggie

blush
with
return
self

take
up
her
work
again

<EOS>
"
no

no

"
Lucy
interpose
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
forbid
your
plunge
Maggie
in
book

<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
her
away
from
them
;
and
I
want
her
to
have
delicious
do

nothing
day

fill
with

ride

driving

Apropos

Shall
we
go
out
for
a
row
on

river

us
to
the
Tofton
way

walk
back

<EOS>
that
be
a
delightful
proposition

Maggie

for
it
be
year
since

have
be
on
the
river

when
she
be
go
to
put
on

bonnet

Lucy
linger
to
give
an
order
to
the
servant
,
and
take
the
opportunity
of
tell
Stephen
that
Maggie
have
no
objection
to
see
Philip
,
so
that
it
be
a
pity
she
have
send
that
note
the
day
before
yesterday
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
write
another
to

morrow
and
invite
him
.

I
will
call

beat
him
up
to

Stephen

"
and
bring
him
with
me
in
the
evening

shall
I

<EOS>
My
sister
will
want
to
call
on
you
when
I
tell
them
your
cousin
be
with
you

I
must
leave
the
field
clear
for
them
in
the
morning

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes

pray
bring
him
,

Lucy

in
a
beseech
tone

be
not
she
a
dear
,
noble
-
looking
creature
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
too
tall
,
"
say
Stephen
,
smile
down
upon
her
,
"
and
a
little
too
fiery
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
my
type
of
woman
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
gentleman
,
you
be
aware
,
be
apt
to
impart
these
imprudent
confidence
to
lady
concern
their
unfavorable
opinion
of
sister
fair
one
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
so
many
woman
have
the
advantage
of
know
that
they
be
secretly
repulsive
to
man
who
have
self
-
denyingly
make
ardent
love
to
them
.
<EOS>
and
hardly
anything
could
be
more
distinctively
characteristic
of
Lucy
than
that
she
both
implicitly
believe
what
Stephen
say
,
and
be
determine
that
Maggie
should
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
but
you
,
who
have
a
high
logic
than
the
verbal
to
guide
you
,
have
already
foresee
,
as
the
direct
sequence
to
that
unfavorable
opinion
of
Stephen
's
,
that
he
walk
down
to
the
boathouse
calculate
,
by
the
aid
of
a
vivid
imagination
,
that
Maggie
must
give
him
her
hand
at
least
twice
in
consequence
of
this
pleasant
boating
plan
,
and
that
a
gentleman
who
wish
lady
to
look
at
him
be
advantageously
situate
when
he
be
row
them
in
a
boat
.
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
have
he
fall
in
love
with
this
surprising
daughter
of
Mrs.
Tulliver
at
first
sight
?
<EOS>
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
such
passion
be
never
hear
of
in
real
life
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
be
in
love
already
,
and
half
-
engaged
to
the
dear
little
creature
in
the
world
;
and
he
be
not
a
man
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
but
when
one
be
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
one
have
not
chalk
-
stone
at
one
's
finger
-
end
that
the
touch
of
a
handsome
girl
should
be
entirely
indifferent
.
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
natural
and
safe
to
admire
beauty
and
enjoy
look
at
it
,
 
at
least
under
such
circumstance
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
really
something
very
interesting
about
this
girl
,
with
her
poverty
and
trouble
;
it
be
gratify
to
see
the
friendship
between
the
two
cousin
.
<EOS>
generally
,
Stephen
admit
,
he
be
not
fond
of
woman
who
have
any
peculiarity
of
character
,
but
here
the
peculiarity
seem
really
of
a
superior
kind
,
and
provide
one
be
not
oblige
to
marry
such
woman
,
why
,
they
certainly
make
a
variety
in
social
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
do
not
fulfil
Stephen
's
hope
by
look
at
him
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
;
her
eye
be
too
full
of
the
old
bank
that
she
know
so
well
.
<EOS>
She
feel
lonely
,
cut
off
from
Philip
,
 
the
only
person
who
have
ever
seem
to
love
her
devotedly
,
as
she
have
always
long
to
be
love
.
<EOS>
but
presently
the
rhythmic
movement
of
the
oar
attract
her
,
and
she
think
she
should
like
to
learn
how
to
row
.
<EOS>
this
rouse
her
from
her
reverie
,
and
she
ask
if
she
may
take
an
oar
.
<EOS>
It
appear
that
she
require
much
teaching
,
and
she
become
ambitious
.
<EOS>
the
exercise
bring
the
warm
blood
into
her
cheek
,
and
make
her
inclined
to
take
her
lesson
merrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
satisfied
until
I
can
manage
both
oar
,
and
row
you
and
Lucy
,
"
she
say
,
look
very
bright
as
she
step
out
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
we
know
,
be
apt
to
forget
the
thing
she
be
do
,
and
she
have
choose
an
inopportune
moment
for
her
remark
;
her
foot
slip
,
but
happily
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
hold
her
hand
,
and
keep
her
up
with
a
firm
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
hurt
yourself
at
all
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
bend
to
look
in
her
face
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
charming
to
be
take
care
of
in
that
kind
,
graceful
manner
by
some
one
tall
and
strong
than
one

Aunt
Pullet
,
under
the
certainty
that
Maggie
would
be
invite
to
go
out
with
Lucy
,
probably
to
Park
House
,
be
much
shock
at
the
shabbiness
of
her
clothe
,
which
when
witness
by
the
high
society
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
would
be
a
discredit
to
the
family
,
that
demand
a
strong
and
prompt
remedy
;
and
the
consultation
as
to
what
would
be
most
suitable
to
this
end
from
among
the
superfluity
of
Mrs.
Pullet
's
wardrobe
be
one
that
Lucy
as
well
as
Mrs.
Tulliver
enter
into
with
some
zeal

<EOS>
Maggie
must
really
have
an
evening
dress
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
she
be
about
the

height
as
aunt
Pullet

<EOS>
"
but
she
be
so
much
broad
across
the
shoulder
than
I
be
,
it
be
very
ill
-
convenient
,
"
say
Mrs.
Pullet
,
"
else
she
may
wear
that
beautiful
black
brocade
o

mine
without
any
alteration

her

add
Mrs.

sorrowfully
,
as

lift
Maggie
's
large
round

She

never

<EOS>
Confidential
Moments
  
<EOS>
when
Maggie
go
up
to
her
bedroom
that
night
,
it
appear
that
she
be
not
at
all
incline
to
undress
.
<EOS>
She
set
down
her
candle
on
the
first
table
that
present
itself
,
and
begin
to
walk
up
and
down
her
room
,
which
be
a
large
one
,
with
a
firm
,
regular
,
and
rather
rapid
step
,
which
show
that
the
exercise
be
the
instinctive
vent
of
strong
excitement
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
and
cheek
have
an
almost
feverish
brilliancy
;
her
head
be
throw
backward
,
and
her
hand
be
clasp
with
the
palm
outward
,
and
with
that
tension
of
the
arm
which
be
apt
to
accompany
mental
absorption
.
  
<EOS>
had
anything
remarkable
happen
?
  
<EOS>
nothing
that
you
be
not
likely
to
consider
in
the
high
degree
unimportant
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
hear
some
fine
music
sing
by
a
fine
bass
voice
,
 
but
then
it
be
sing
in
a
provincial
,
amateur
fashion
,
such
as
would
have
leave
a
critical
ear
much
to
desire
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
conscious
of
have
be
look
at
a
great
deal
,
in
rather
a
furtive
manner
,
from
beneath
a
pair
of
well
-
mark
horizontal
eyebrow
,
with
a
glance
that
seem
somehow
to
have
catch
the
vibratory
influence
of
the
voice
.
<EOS>
such
thing
could
have
have
no
perceptible
effect
on
a
thoroughly
well
-
educate
young
lady
,
with
a
perfectly
balance
mind
,
who
have
have
all
the
advantage
of
fortune
,
training
,
and
refined
society
.
<EOS>
but
if
Maggie
have
be
that
young
lady
,
you
would
probably
have
know
nothing
about
her
:
her
life
would
have
have
so
few
vicissitude
that
it
could
hardly
have
be
write
;
for
the
happy
woman
,
like
the
happy
nation
,
have
no
history
.
  
<EOS>
in
poor
Maggie
's
highly
-
strung
,
hungry
nature
,
 
just
come
away
from
a
third
-
rate
schoolroom
,
with
all
its
jarring
sound
and
petty
round
of
task
,
 
these
apparently
trivial
cause
have
the
effect
of
rouse
and
exalt
her
imagination
in
a
way
that
be
mysterious
to
herself
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
she
think
distinctly
of
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
or
dwelt
on
the
indication
that
he
look
at
her
with
admiration
;
it
be
rather
that
she
feel
the
half
-
remote
presence
of
a
world
of
love
and
beauty
and
delight
,
make
up
of
vague
,
mingled
image
from
all
the
poetry
and
romance
she
have
ever
read
,
or
have
ever
weave
in
her
dreamy
reverie
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
glance
back
once
or
twice
to
the
time
when
she
have
court
privation
,
when
she
have
think
all
longing
,
all
impatience
be
subdue
;
but
that
condition
seem
irrecoverably
go
,
and
she
recoil
from
the
remembrance
of
it
.
<EOS>
no
prayer
,
no
strive
now
,
would
bring
back
that
negative
peace
;
the
battle
of
her
life
,
it
seem
,
be
not
to
be
decide
in
that
short
and
easy
way
,
 
by
perfect
renunciation
at
the
very
threshold
of
her
youth
.
  
<EOS>
the
music
be
vibrate
in
her
still
,
 
Purcell
's
music
,
with
its
wild
passion
and
fancy
,
 
and
<EOS>
she
could
not
stay
in
the
recollection
of
that
bare
,
lonely
past
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
her
bright
aerial
world
again
,
when
a
little
tap
come
at
the
door
;
of
course
it
be
her
cousin
,
who
enter
in
ample
white
dressing

<EOS>
"
why

Maggie

say
Lucy
,
in
astonishment
.

"
I
promise

Lucy
sit
down
near
the
toilette

table

watch

with
affectionate
eye

head
a
little
aside

like

incredible

<EOS>
the
narrative
last
long

for
Maggie
have
never
before
know
the
relief
of
such
an
outpouring
;
she
have
never
before
tell
Lucy
anything
of
her
inmost
life
;
and
the
sweet
face
bent
toward
her
with
sympathetic
interest

and
the
little
hand
press
her
,
encourage
her
to
speak
on
.
<EOS>
on
two
point
only
she
be
not
expansive

<EOS>
She
do
not
betray
fully
what
still
rankle
in
her
mind
as
Tom
's
great
offence

the
insult
he
have
heap
on
Philip

<EOS>
angry
as
the
remembrance
still
make
her
<EOS>

she
could
not

any

else
should
know
it
at
all
,
both
for
Tom
's
sake
and
Philip
's
.
<EOS>
and
she
could
not
bear
to
tell
Lucy
of
the
last
scene
between
her
father
and
Wakem
,
though
it
be
this
scene
which
she
have
ever
since
feel
to
be
a
new
barrier
between
herself
and
Philip
.
<EOS>
She
merely
say
,
she
see
now
that
Tom
be
,
on
the
whole
,
right
in
regard
any
prospect
of
love
and
marriage
between
her
and
Philip
as
put
out
of
the
question
by
the
relation
of
the
two
family

<EOS>
of
course
Philip
's
father
would
never
consent

"
there

Lucy

you

my

downward

then
add
,
look
at
Maggie

It

beautiful

love
Philip

I
never

in

you

up

there
be
obstacle
now

they
may

yes

yes

I
can

be
hopeful
about

there
be
something
romantic

out

just
what
everything

be

Philip
will
adore
you
like
a
husband
in
a
fairy
tale

<EOS>
oh

I
shall
puzzle
my
small
brain
to
contrive
some
plot
that
will
bring
everybody
into
the

Our

one
of
those
queer
old

pierce
with
surprising
passage
,
by
the
water

side

where
,
as
he
observe

his

could
keep
themselves
out

that

It
be
Bob

wife
who
open
the
door
to
Maggie

<EOS>
She
be
a
tiny
woman
,
with
the
general
physiognomy
of
a
dutch
doll
,
look
,
in
comparison
with
Bob
's
mother
,
who
fill
up
the
passage
in
the
rear
,
very
much
like
one
of
those
human
figure
which
the
artist
find
conveniently

near
a
colossal
statue
to
show
the
proportion

look
up
at
Maggie
with
some
awe
as
soon

but
the
word
,
"

<EOS>
which
Maggie
utter
smilingly

make
her

endeavor
to
flatten
her
person
against
the
wall
to
make
the

space
for
the
visitor

<EOS>
sad
recollection
crowd
on
Maggie
as
she
enter
the
small
parlor
,
which
be
now
all
that
poor
Tom
have
to
call
by

the

sum
of
dear
familiar
object

<EOS>
but
everything
be
not
strange
to
her
in
this
new
room

the
first
thing
her
eye
dwell
on

the
large
old
Bible

the

be
not

her

then
lift
up
the
corner

hold
it
to
her
face
with
an
air

embarrassment

do

I
be
a

I

I
think
tow'rt
last
Christmas

I
would
find
out
a
soft
place
in

It

about
a

a

<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
have
very
little
power
over
him

Bob

"
say
Maggie
,
a
good
deal
move
by
Bob
's
suggestion

<EOS>
It
be
a
totally
new
idea
to
her
mind
that
Tom
could
have
his
love
trouble
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
and
in
love
with
Lucy
too
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
perhaps
a
mere
fancy
of
Bob
's
too
officious
brain
.
<EOS>
the
present
of
the
dog
mean
nothing
more
than
cousinship
and
gratitude
.
<EOS>
but
Bob
have
already
say
,
"
here

"
there

Maggie

as

<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
you

Tom
stand
with
his
back
against
the
chimney

piece
,
and
Maggie
be
seat
opposite
the
light
.
<EOS>
He
notice
that
she
be
tremulous
,
and
he
have
a
presentiment
of
the
subject
she
be
go
to
speak
about
.
<EOS>
the
presentiment
make
his
voice
cold
and
harder
as
he
say
,
"
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
tone
rouse
a
spirit
of
resistance
in
Maggie
,
and
she
put
her
request
in
quite
a
different
form
from
the
one
she
have
predetermine
on
.
<EOS>
She
rise
from
her
seat
,
and
look
straight
at
Tom
,
say
,
    
"
I
want
you
to
absolve
me

my
promise

<EOS>
"
very
well

say
Tom
,
still
more
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
but
Maggie
have
hardly
finish
speak
in
that
chill
,
defiant
manner
,
before
she
repent
,
and
feel
the
dread
of
alienation
from
her
brother

not
for
myself

dear
Tom

not

she
wish
him
to

have
invite

evening

will
never

<EOS>
Tom
look
away
from
Maggie
,
knit
his
brow
more
strongly
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
then
he
turn
to
her
and
say
,
slowly
and
emphatically
,
    
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
be
my
feeling
on
that
subject

there
be
no

anything

bind
to

power
over
you

to
prevent
you
from
disgrace
him
as
well
as
yourself

all
of
us

now
I
must
leave
you
to
your
own
choice

You
wish
to
be
independent

you
tell
me
so
after
my
father

death

My
opinion
be
not

if
you

of
Philip
Wakem
as
a
lover
again

you
must
give
up
me

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
it
,
dear
Tom

at
least
as
thing
be
;
I
see
that
it
would
lead
to
misery

<EOS>

I
shall
soon
go
away
to
another
situation

I
should
like
to
be
friend
with
him
again

I
be
here

wish
it

<EOS>
the
severity
of
Tom
's
face
relax
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
mind
your
see
him
occasionally
at
my
uncle

I
do
not
want
you
to
make
a

subject

It

borne
everything

<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
be
childish
;
the
tear
would
come
.
<EOS>
when
Maggie
be
not
angry
,
she
be
as
dependent
on
kind
or
cold
word
as
a
daisy
on

sunshine

the
cloud

the
need
of
be
love
would
always
subdue
her

it
subdue

the

goodness
come
uppermost
at
this
appeal

it
could
only
show
itself
in
Tom

fashion

He
put
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm

say
,
in
the
tone
of
a
kind
pedagogue

you
a
good
home
,
and
you
may
have
live
respectably
amongst
your
relation
,
until
I
could
have
provide
a
home
for
you
with
my
mother
.
<EOS>
and
that
be
what
I
should
like
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
wish
my
sister
to
be
a
lady
,
and
I
always
have
take
care
of
you
,
as
my
father
desire
,
until
you
be
well
married
.
<EOS>
but
your
idea
and
mine
never
accord
,
and
you
will
not
give
way
.
<EOS>
yet
you
may
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
a
brother
,
who
go
out
into
the
world
and
mix
with
man
,
necessarily
know
better
what
be
right
and
respectable
for
his
sister
than
she
can
know
herself
.
<EOS>
You
think
I
be
not
kind
;
but
my
kindness
can
only
be
direct
by
what
I
believe
to
be
good
for
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

I
know
,
dear
Tom

Maggie

still
half
-
sob
,

try
to
control
her
tear

I

you
would
do
a
great

know
how
you

do

yourself

<EOS>
I
be
grateful
to
you

<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
you
can
not
quite
judge
for
me

our
nature
be
very
different

You
do
not

how
differently
thing
affect
me
from
what
they
do
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
_
do
_
know
;
I
know
it
too
well
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
differently
you
must
feel
about
all
that
affect
our
family
,
and
your
own
dignity
as
a
young
woman
,
before
you
could
think
of
receive
secret
address
from
Philip
Wakem
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
disgusting
to
me
in
every
other
way
,
I
should
object
to
my
sister

name
be
associate
for
a
moment
with
that
of
a
young
man
whose
father
must
hate
the
very
thought
of
us
all
,
and
would
spurn
you
.
<EOS>
with
any
one
<EOS>
but
you
,
I
should
think
it
quite
certain
that
what
you
witness
just
before
my
father
's
death
would
secure
you
from
ever
think
again
of
Philip
Wakem
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
feel
certain
of
it
with
you
;
I
never
feel
certain
about
anything
with
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
you
take
pleasure
in
a
sort
of
perverse
self
-
denial
,
and
at
another
you
have
not
resolution
to
resist
a
thing
that
you
know
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
terrible
cut
truth
in
Tom
's
word
,
 
that
hard
rind
of
truth
which
be
discern
by
unimaginative
,
unsympathetic
mind
.
<EOS>
Maggie
always
writhe
under
this
judgment
of
Tom
's
;
she
rebel
and
be
humiliate
in
the
same
moment
;
it
seem
as
if
he
hold
a
glass
before
her
to
show
her
her
own
folly
and
weakness
,
as
if
he
be
a
prophetic
voice
predict
her
future
falling
;
and
yet
,
all
the
while
,
she
judge
him
in
return
;
she
say
inwardly
that
he
be
narrow
and
unjust
,
that
he
be
below
feel
those
mental
need
which
be
often
the
source
of
the
wrong
-
doing
or
absurdity
that
make
her
life
a
planless
riddle
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
answer
directly
;
her
heart
be
too
full
,
and
she
sit
down
,
lean
her
arm
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
try
to
make
Tom
feel
that
she
be
near
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
always
repel
her
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
under
his
word
be
complicate
by
the
allusion
to
the
last
scene
between
her
father
and
Wakem
;
and
at
length
that
painful
,
solemn
memory
surmount
the
immediate
grievance
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
of
such
thing
with
frivolous
indifference
,
and
Tom
must
not
accuse
her
of
that
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
with
a
grave
,
earnest
gaze
and
say
,
    
"
I
can
not
make
you
think
better
of
me
,
Tom
,
by
anything
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
so
shut
out
from
all
your
feeling
as
you
believe
me
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
see
as
well
as
you
do
that
from
our
position
with
regard
to
Philip
's
father
 
not
on
other
ground
 
it
would
be
unreasonable
,
it
would
be
wrong
,
for
us
to
entertain
the
idea
of
marriage
;
and
I
have
give
up
think
of
him
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
you
the
truth
,
and
you
have
no
right
to
disbelieve
me
;
I
have
keep
my
word
to
you
,
and
you
have
never
detect
me
in
a
falsehood
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
only
not
encourage
,
I
should
carefully
avoid
,
any
intercourse
with
Philip
on
any
other
footing
than
of
quiet
friendship
.
<EOS>
You
may
think
that
I
be
unable
to
keep
my
resolution
;
but
at
least
you
ought
not
to
treat
me
with
hard
contempt
on
the
ground
of
fault
that
I
have
not
commit
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

Maggie

"
say
Tom
,
soften
under
this
appeal
,
"
I
do
not
want
to
overstrain
matter
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
all
thing
consider
,
it
will
be
good
for
you
to
see
Philip
Wakem
,
if
Lucy
wish
him
to
come
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
believe
what
you
say
,
 
at
least
you
believe
it
yourself
,
I
know
;
I
can
only
warn
you
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
as
good
a
brother
to
you
as
you
will
let
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
tremor
in
Tom
's
voice
as
he
utter
the
last
word
,
and
Maggie
's
ready
affection
come
back
with
as
sudden
a
glow
as
when
they
be
child
,
and
bite
their
cake
together
as
a
sacrament
of
conciliation
.
<EOS>
She
rise
and
lay
her
hand
on
Tom
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Tom

I
know
you

be
good

I

do
a
great

You

I

altogether
naughty

<EOS>
Tom
smile
at
the
eager
face
;
his
smile
be
very
pleasant
to
see
when
they
do
come
,
for
the
gray
eye
could
be
tender
underneath
the
frown

masculine
philosophy

fling
the
bell

rope
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room

not
very
far

a
touch

human
experience

I
flatter
myself
will
come
home
to

distinguished
man
who

once
at
an
early

Bank
together
<EOS>

"
there
be
another
matter
I
want
to
talk
to
you
about
.

since
you
be
likely
to
have
rather
a
smoky
,
unpleasant
time
of
it
at
Newcastle
for
the
next
few
week
,
you
will
want
a
good
prospect
of
some
sort
to
keep
up
your
spirit

<EOS>
Tom
wait
less
nervously
than
he
have
do
on
a
former
occasion
in
this
apartment
,
while
his
uncle
take
out
his
snuff
-
box
and
gratify
each
nostril
with
deliberate
impartiality

<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Tom
,
"
say
Mr.
Deane
at
last
,
throw
himself
backward
,
"
the
world
go
on
at
a
smart
pace
now
than
it
do
when
I
be
a
young
fellow
.
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
forty
year
ago
,
when
I
be
much
such
a
strapping
youngster
as
you
,
a
man
expect
to
pull
between
the
shaft
the
good
part
of
his
life
,
before
he
get
the
whip
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
loom
go
slowish
,
and
fashion
do
not
alter
quite
so
fast
;
I
would
a
good
suit
that
last
me
six
year
.
<EOS>
everything
be
on
a
low
scale
,
sir
,
 
in
point
of
expenditure
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
steam
,
you
see
,
that
have
make
the
difference
;
it
drive
on
every
wheel
double
pace
,
and
the
wheel
of
fortune
along
with
'em
,
as
our
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
say
at
the
anniversary
dinner
(
he
hit
these
thing
off
wonderfully
,
consider
he
be
see
nothing
of
business
)
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
find
fault
with
the
change
,
as
some
people
do
.
<EOS>
Trade
,
sir
,
open
a
man
's
eye
;
and
if
the
population
be
to
get
thick
upon
the
ground
,
as
it
be
do
,
the
world
must
use
its
wit
at
invention
of
one
sort
or
other
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
do
my
share
as
an
ordinary
man
of
business
.
<EOS>
somebody
have
say
it
be
a
fine
thing
to
make
two
ear
of
corn
grow
where
only
one
grow
before
;
but
,
sir
,
it
be
a
fine
thing
,
too
,
to
further
the
exchange
of
commodity
,
and
bring
the
grain
of
corn
to
the
mouth
that
be
hungry
.
<EOS>
and
that
be
our
line
of
business
;
and
I
consider
it
as
honorable
a
position
as
a
man
can
hold
,
to
be
connect
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
know
that
the
affair
his
uncle
have
to
speak
of
be
not
urgent
;
Mr.
Deane
be
too
shrewd
and
practical
a
man
to
allow
either
his
reminiscence
or
his
snuff
to
impede
the
progress
of
trade
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
for
the
last
month
or
two
,
there
have
be
hint
throw
out
to
Tom
which
enable
him
to
guess
that
he
be
go
to
hear
some
proposition
for
his
own
benefit
.
<EOS>
with
the
beginning
of
the
last
speech
he
have
stretch
out
his
leg
,
thrust
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
prepare
himself
for
some
introductory
diffuseness
,
tend
to
show
that
Mr.
Deane
have
succeed
by
his
own
merit
,
and
that
what
he
have
to
say
to
young
man
in
general
be
,
that
if
they
do
not
succeed
too
it
be
because
of
their
own
demerit
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
surprised
,
then
,
when
his
uncle
put
a
direct
question
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
,
 
it
be
go
on
for
seven
year
now
since
you
apply
to
me
for
a
situation
,
eh
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
;
I
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
now
,
"
say
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
it
be
as
well
not
to
say
that
,
though
;
for
you
would
pass
for
a
good
deal
old
,
and
age
tell
well
in
business
.
<EOS>
I
remember
your
come
very
well
;
I
remember
I
see
there
be
some
pluck
in
you
,
and
that
be
what
make
me
give
you
encouragement
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
happy
to
say
I
be
right
;
I
be
not
often
deceive
.
<EOS>
I
be
naturally
a
little
shy
at
push
my
nephew
,
but
I
be
happy
to
say
you
have
do
me
credit
,
sir
;
and
if
I
would
have
a
son
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
own
,
I
should
not
have
be
sorry
to
see
him
like
you

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
tap
his
box
and
open
it
again
,
repeat
in
a
tone
of
some
feeling
,
"
no
,
I
should
not
have
be
sorry
to
see
him
like
you

I
be
very
glad
I
have
give
you
satisfaction

I
have
do
my
good
,

say
Tom
,
in
his
proud
,
independent
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Tom
,
you
have
give
me
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
speak
of
your
conduct
as
a
son
;
though
that
weigh
with
me
in
my
opinion
of
you
.
<EOS>
but
what
I
have
to
do
with
,
as
a
partner
in
our
firm
,
be
the
quality
you
have
show
as
a
man
o
'
business
.
<EOS>
Ours
be
a
fine
business
,
 
a
splendid
concern
,
sir
,
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
reason
why
it
should
not
go
on
grow
<EOS>
;
there
be
a
grow
capital
,
and
grow
outlet
for
it
;
but
there
be
another
thing
that
be
want
for
the
prosperity
of
every
concern
,
large
or
small
,
and
that
be
man
to
conduct
it
,
 
man
of
the
right
habit
;
none
o
'
<EOS>
your
flashy
fellow
,
but
such
as
be
to
be
depend
on
.
<EOS>
now
this
be
what
Mr.
Guest
and
I
see
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
three
year
ago
we
take
Gell
into
the
concern
;
we
give
him
a
share
in
the
oil
-
mill
.
<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
why
,
because
Gell
be
a
fellow
whose
service
be
worth
a
premium
.
<EOS>
so
it
will
always
be
,
sir
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
me
.
<EOS>
and
though
Gell
be
pretty
near
ten
year
old
than
you
,
there
be
other
point
in
your
favor
.
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
be
get
a
little
nervous
as
Mr.
Deane
go
on
speak
;
he
be
conscious
of
something
he
have
in
his
mind
to
say
,
which
may
not
be
agreeable
to
his
uncle
,
simply
because
it
be
a
new
suggestion
rather
than
an
acceptance
of
the
proposition
he
foresee
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
stand
to
reason
,
"
Mr.
Deane
go
on
,
when
he
have
finish
his
new
pinch
,
"
that
your
be
my
nephew
weigh
in
your
favor
;
but
I
do
not
deny
that
if
you
would
be
no
relation
of
mine
at
all
,
your
conduct
in
that
affair
of
Pelley
's
bank
would
have
lead
Mr.
Guest
and
myself
to
make
some
acknowledgment
of
the
service
you
have
be
to
us
;
and
,
back
by
your
general
conduct
and
business
ability
,
it
have
make
us
determine
on
give
you
a
share
in
the
business
,
 
<EOS>
a
share
which
we
shall
be
glad
to
increase
as
the
year
go
on
.
<EOS>
We
think
that
will
be
well
,
on
all
ground
,
than
raise
your
salary
.
<EOS>
It
will
give
you
more
importance
,
and
prepare
you
better
for
take
some
of
the
anxiety
off
my
shoulder
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
I
be
equal
to
a
good
deal
o
'
work
at
present
,
thank
God
;
but
I
be
get
old
,
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
deny
that
.
<EOS>
I
tell
Mr.
Guest
I
would
open
the
subject
to
you
;
and
when
you
come
back
from
this
northern
business
,
we
can
go
into
particular
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
stride
for
a
young
fellow
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
but
I
be
bind
to
say
you
have
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
grateful
to
Mr.
Guest
and
you
,
sir
;
of
course
I
feel
the
most
indebted
to
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
who
first
take
me
into
the
business
,
and
have
take
a
good
deal
of
pain
with
me
since
.

"
  
<EOS>
Tom
speak
with
a
slight
tremor

and
pause
after
he
have
say
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
Mr.
Deane
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
spare
pain
when
I
see
they
will
be
of
any
use

<EOS>
I
give
myself
some
trouble
with
Gell
,
else
he
would
not
have
be
what
he
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
one
thing
I
should
like
to
mention
to
you
uncle
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
speak
to
you
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
if
you
remember
,
at
the
time
my
father
's
property
be
sell
,
there
be
some
thought
of
your
firm
buy
the
Mill
;
I
know
you
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
investment
,
especially
if
steam
be
apply
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
but
Wakem
outbid
us
;
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
that
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
fond
of
carry
everything
over
other
people
's
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
of
no
use
my
mention
it
at
present
,
"
Tom
go
on
,
"
but
I
wish
you
to
know
what
I
have
in
my
mind
about
the
Mill
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
feeling
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
father
's
dying
wish
that
I
should
try
and
get
it
back
again
whenever
I
could
;
it
be
in
his
family
for
five
generation
.
<EOS>
I
promise
my
father
;
and
besides
that
,
I
be
attach
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
like
any
other
so
well
.
<EOS>
and
if
it
should
ever
suit
your
view
to
buy
it
for
the
firm
,
I
should
have
a
well
chance
of
fulfil
my
father
's
wish
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
like
to
mention
the
thing
to
you
,
only
you
have
be
kind
enough
to
say
my
service
have
be
of
some
value
.
<EOS>
and
I
would
give
up
a
much
great
chance
in
life
for
the
sake
of
have
the
Mill
again
,
 
I
mean
have
it
in
my
own
hand
,
and
gradually
work
off
the
price
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
have
listen
attentively
,
and
now
look
thoughtful
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
I
see
,
"
he
say
,
after
a
while
;
"
the
thing
would
be
possible
if
there
be
any
chance
of
Wakem
's
parting
with
the
property
.
<EOS>
but
that
I
_
do
not
_
see
.
<EOS>
He
be
put
that
young
Jetsome
in
the
place
;
and
he
have
his
reason
when
he
buy
it
,
I
will
be
bind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
loose
fish
,
that
young
Jetsome
,
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
take
to
drink
,
and
they
say
he
be
let
the
business
go
down
.
<EOS>
Luke
tell
me
about
it
,
 
our
old
miller
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
sha'n"t
stay
unless
there
be
an
alteration
.
<EOS>
I
be
think
,
if
thing
go
on
that
way
,
Wakem
may
be
more
willing
to
part
with
the
Mill
.
<EOS>
Luke
say
he
be
get
very
sour
about
the
way
thing
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
turn
it
over
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
I
must
inquire
into
the
matter
,
and
go
into
it
with
Mr.
Guest
.
<EOS>
but
,
you
see
,
it
be
rather
strike
out
a
new
branch
,
and
put
you
to
that
,
instead
of
keep
you
where
you
be
,
which
be
what
we
would
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
able
to
manage
more
than
the
mill
when
thing
be
once
set
properly
go
,
sir

<EOS>
I
want
to
have
plenty
of
work

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
else
I
care
about
much

<EOS>
there
be
something
rather
sad
in
that
speech
from
a
young
man

three

twenty

even
in
uncle
Deane

Pooh

to
care
about

of
these

,
if
you
get
on
at
this
pace

<EOS>
but
as
to
this
mill
,
we
must
not
reckon
on
our
chicken
too
early

<EOS>
however
,
I
promise
you
to
bear
it
in
mind
,
and
when
you
come
back
we
will
talk
of
it
again

I

go
to
dinner

come

breakfast

It
be
evident
to
you
now
that
Maggie
have
arrive
at
a
moment
in
her
life
which
must
be
consider
by
all
prudent
person
as
a
great
opportunity
for
a
young
woman

<EOS>
launch
into
the
high

with
a

which
have
the
advantage
of
be
quite
unfamiliar

and
with
such
moderate
assistance
of
costume
as
you
have
see
foreshadow
in
Lucy
's
anxious
colloquy
with

Pullet

Maggie
be
certainly
at

at
Lucy

young
Torry
fatigue

may
see
him
in
all

additional

by
his

and
several
young
lady
go
home
intending
to
have
short
sleeve
with
black
lace
,
and
to
plait
their
hair
in
a
broad
coronet
at
the
back
of
their
head
,
 
"
that
cousin
of
Miss
Deane
's
look
so
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
fact
,
poor
Maggie
,
with
all
her
inward
consciousness
of
a
painful
past
and
her
presentiment
of
a
troublous
future
,
be
on
the
way
to
become
an
object
of
some
envy
,
 
a
topic
of
discussion
in
the
newly
establish
billiard
-
room
,
and
between
fair
friend
who
have
no
secret
from
each
other
on
the
subject
of
trimming
.
<EOS>
the
Miss
Guests
,
who
associate
chiefly
on
term
of
condescension
with
the
family
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
be
the
glass
of
fashion
there
,
take
some
exception
to
Maggie
's
manner
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
way
of
not
assent
at
once
to
the
observation
current
in
good
society
,
and
of
say
that
she
do
not
know
whether
those
observation
be
true
or
not
,
which
give
her
an
air
of
_
gaucherie
_
,
and
impede
the
even
flow
of
conversation
;
but
it
be
a
fact
capable
of
an
amiable
interpretation
that
lady
be
not
the
bad
dispose
toward
a
new
acquaintance
of
their
own
sex
because
she
have
point
of
inferiority
.
<EOS>
and
Maggie
be
so
entirely
without
those
pretty
air
of
coquetry
which
have
the
traditional
reputation
of
drive
gentleman
to
despair
that
she
win
some
feminine
pity
for
be
so
ineffective
in
spite
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
have
many
advantage
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
and
it
must
be
admit
there
be
no
pretension
about
her
;
her
abruptness
and
unevenness
of
manner
be
plainly
the
result
of
her
secluded
and
lowly
circumstance
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
wonder
that
there
be
no
tinge
of
vulgarity
about
her
,
consider
what
the
rest
of
poor
Lucy
's
relation
be
 
an
allusion
which
always
make
the
Miss
Guests
shudder
a
little
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
agreeable
to
think
of
any
connection
by
marriage
with
such
people
as
the
Gleggs
and
the
pullet
;
but
it
be
of
no
use
to
contradict
Stephen
when
once
he
have
set
his
mind
on
anything
,
and
certainly
there
be
no
possible
objection
to
Lucy
in
herself
,
 
<EOS>
no
one
could
help
like
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
naturally
desire
that
the
Miss
Guests
should
behave
kindly
to
this
cousin
of
whom
she
be
so
fond
,
and
Stephen
would
make
a
great
fuss
if
they
be
deficient
in
civility
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
the
invitation
to
Park
House
be
not
want
;
and
elsewhere
,
also
,
Miss
Deane
be
too
popular
and
too
distinguish
a
member
of
society
in
St.
Ogg
's
for
any
attention
toward
her
to
be
neglect
.
  
<EOS>
thus
Maggie
be
introduce
for
the
first
time
to
the
young
lady
's
life
,
and
know
what
it
be
to
get
up
in
the
morning
without
any
imperative
reason
for
do
one
thing
more
than
another
.
<EOS>
this
new
sense
of
leisure
and
unchecked
enjoyment
amidst
the
soft
-
breathing
air
and
garden
-
scent
of
advance
spring
 
amidst
the
new
abundance
of
music
,
and
linger
stroll
in
the
sunshine
,
and
the
delicious
dreaminess
of
glide
on
the
river
 
could
hardly
be
without
some
intoxicate
effect
on
her
,
after
her
year
of
privation
;
and
even
in
the
first
week
Maggie
begin
to
be
less
haunt
by
her
sad
memory
and
anticipation
.
<EOS>
life
be
certainly
very
pleasant
just
now
;
it
be
become
very
pleasant
to
dress
in
the
evening
,
and
to
feel
that
she
be
one
of
the
beautiful
thing
of
this
spring
-
time
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
admire
eye
always
await
her
now
;
she
be
no
longer
an
unheeded
person
,
liable
to
be
chid
,
from
whom
attention
be
continually
claim
,
and
on
whom
no
one
feel
bind
to
confer
any
.
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
,
too
,
when
Stephen
and
Lucy
be
go
out
ride
,
to
sit
down
at
the
piano
alone
,
and
find
that
the
old
fitness
between
her
finger
and
the
key
remain
,
and
revive
,
like
a
sympathetic
kinship
not
to
be
wear
out
by
separation
;
to
get
the
tune
she
have
hear
the
evening
before
,
and
repeat
them
again
and
again
until
she
have
find
out
a
way
of
produce
them
so
as
to
make
them
a
more
pregnant
,
passionate
language
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
mere
concord
of
octave
be
a
delight
to
Maggie
,
and
she
would
often
take
up
a
book
of
study
rather
than
any
melody
,
that
she
may
taste
more
keenly
by
abstraction
the
more
primitive
sensation
of
interval
.
<EOS>
not
that
her
enjoyment
of
music
be
of
the
kind
that
indicate
a
great
specific
talent
;
it
be
rather
that
her
sensibility
to
the
supreme
excitement
of
music
be
only
one
form
of
that
passionate
sensibility
which
belong
to
her
whole
nature
,
and
make
her
fault
and
virtue
all
merge
in
each
other
;
make
her
affection
sometimes
an
impatient
demand
,
but
also
prevent
her
vanity
from
take
the
form
of
mere
feminine
coquetry
and
device
,
and
give
it
the
poetry
of
ambition
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
know
Maggie
a
long
while
,
and
need
to
be
tell
,
not
her
characteristic
,
but
her
history
,
which
be
a
thing
hardly
to
be
predict
even
from
the
complete
knowledge
of
characteristic
.
<EOS>
for
the
tragedy
of
our
life
be
not
create
entirely
from
within
.
<EOS>
"
character
,
"
say
Novalis
,
in
one
of
his
questionable
aphorism
,
 
"
character
be
destiny
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
not
the
whole
of
our
destiny
.
<EOS>
Hamlet
,
Prince
of
Denmark
,
be
speculative
and
irresolute
,
and
we
have
a
great
tragedy
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
but
if
his
father
have
live
to
a
good
old
age
,
and
his
uncle
have
die
an
early
death
,
we
can
conceive
Hamlet
's
have
marry
Ophelia
,
and
get
through
life
with
a
reputation
of
sanity
,
notwithstanding
many
soliloquy
,
and
some
moody
sarcasm
toward
the
fair
daughter
of
Polonius
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
frank
incivility
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
destiny
,
then
,
be
at
present
hide
,
and
we
must
wait
for
it
to
reveal
itself
like
the
course
of
an
unmapped
river
;
we
only
know
that
the
river
be
full
and
rapid
,
and
that
for
all
river
there
be
the
same
final
home
.
<EOS>
under
the
charm
of
her
new
pleasure
,
Maggie
herself
be
cease
to
think
,
with
her
eager
prefiguring
imagination
,
of
her
future
lot
;
and
her
anxiety
about
her
first
interview
with
Philip
be
lose
its
predominance
;
perhaps
,
unconsciously
to
herself
,
she
be
not
sorry
that
the
interview
have
be
defer
.
  
<EOS>
for
Philip
have
not
come
the
evening
he
be
expect
,
and
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
bring
word
that
he
be
go
to
the
coast
,
 
probably
,
he
think
,
on
a
sketch
expedition
;
but
it
be
not
certain
when
he
would
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
like
Philip
,
to
go
off
in
that
way
without
tell
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
the
twelfth
day
that
he
return
,
to
find
both
Lucy
's
note
await
him
;
he
have
leave
before
he
know
of
Maggie
's
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
one
have
nee
be
nineteen
again
to
be
quite
convinced
of
the
feeling
that
be
crowd
for
Maggie
into
those
twelve
day
;
of
the
length
to
which
they
be
stretch
for
her
by
the
novelty
of
her
experience
in
them
,
and
the
varying
attitude
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
the
early
day
of
an
acquaintance
almost
always
have
this
importance
for
us
,
and
fill
up
a
large
space
in
our
memory
than
longer
subsequent
period
,
which
have
be
less
fill
with
discovery
and
new
impression
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
many
hour
in
those
ten
day
in
which
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
be
not
seat
by
Lucy
's
side
,
or
stand
near
her
at
the
piano
,
or
accompany
her
on
some
outdoor
excursion
;
his
attention
be
clearly
become
more
assiduous
,
and
that
be
what
every
one
have
expect
.
<EOS>
Lucy
be
very
happy
,
all
the
happy
because
Stephen
's
society
seem
to
have
become
much
more
interesting
and
amusing
since
Maggie
have
be
there
.
<EOS>
playful
discussion
 
<EOS>
sometimes
serious
one
 
be
go
forward
,
in
which
both
Stephen
and
Maggie
reveal
themselves
,
to
the
admiration
of
the
gentle
,
unobtrusive
Lucy
;
and
it
more
than
once
cross
her
mind
<EOS>
what
a
charming
quartet
they
should
have
through
life
when
Maggie
marry
Philip
.
<EOS>
be
it
an
inexplicable
thing
that
a
girl
should
enjoy
her
lover
's
society
the
more
for
the
presence
of
a
third
person
,
and
be
without
the
slight
spasm
of
jealousy
that
the
third
person
have
the
conversation
habitually
direct
to
her
?
<EOS>
not
when
that
girl
be
as
tranquil
-
hearte
as
Lucy
,
thoroughly
possess
with
a
belief
that
she
know
the
state
of
her
companion
'
affection
,
and
not
prone
to
the
feeling
which
shake
such
a
belief
in
the
absence
of
positive
evidence
against
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
Lucy
by
whom
Stephen
sit
,
to
whom
he
give
his
arm
,
to
whom
he
appeal
as
the
person
sure
to
agree
with
him
;
and
every
day
there
be
the
same
tender
politeness
toward
her
,
the
same
consciousness
of
her
want
and
care
to
supply
them
.
<EOS>
be
there
really
the
same
?
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Lucy
that
there
be
more
;
and
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
real
significance
of
the
change
escape
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
subtle
act
of
conscience
in
Stephen
that
even
he
himself
be
not
aware
of
.
<EOS>
His
personal
attention
to
Maggie
be
comparatively
slight
,
and
there
have
even
spring
up
an
apparent
distance
between
them
,
that
prevent
the
renewal
of
that
faint
resemblance
to
gallantry
into
which
he
have
fall
the
first
day
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
if
Stephen
come
in
when
Lucy
be
out
of
the
room
,
if
Lucy
leave
them
together
,
they
never
speak
to
each
other
;
Stephen
,
perhaps
,
seem
to
be
examine
book
or
music
,
and
Maggie
bend
her
head
assiduously
over
her
work
.
<EOS>
each
be
oppressively
conscious
of
the
other
's
presence
,
even
to
the
finger
-
end
.
<EOS>
yet
each
look
and
long
for
the
same
thing
to
happen
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them
have
begin
to
reflect
on
the
matter
,
or
silently
to
ask
,
"
to
what
do
all
this
tend
?
"
<EOS>
Maggie
only
feel
that
life
be
reveal
something
quite
new
to
her
;
and
she
be
absorb
in
the
direct
,
immediate
experience
,
without
any
energy
leave
for
take
account
of
it
and
reason
about
it
.
<EOS>
Stephen
wilfully
abstain
from
self
-
question
,
and
would
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
feel
an
influence
which
be
to
have
any
determine
effect
on
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
and
when
Lucy
come
into
the
room
again
,
they
be
once
more
unconstrained
;
Maggie
could
contradict
Stephen
,
and
laugh
at
him
,
and
he
could
recommend
to
her
consideration
the
example
of
that
most
charming
heroine
,
Miss
Sophia
Western
,
who
have
a
great
"
respect
for
the
understanding
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
Maggie
could
look
at
Stephen
,
which
,
for
some
reason
or
other
she
always
avoid
when
they
be
alone
;
and
he
could
even
ask
her
to
play
his
accompaniment
for
him
,
since
Lucy
's
finger
be
so
busy
with
that
bazaar
-
work
,
and
lecture
her
on
hurry
the
tempo
,
which
be
certainly
Maggie
's
weak
point
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
 
it
be
the
day
of
Philip
's
return
 
Lucy
have
form
a
sudden
engagement
to
spend
the
evening
with
Mrs.
Kenn
,
whose
delicate
state
of
health
,
threaten
to
become
confirm
illness
through
an
attack
of
bronchitis
,
oblige
her
to
resign
her
function
at
the
come
bazaar
into
the
hand
of
other
lady
,
of
whom
she
wish
Lucy
to
be
one
.
<EOS>
the
engagement
have
be
form
in
Stephen
's
presence
,
and
he
have
hear
Lucy
promise
to
dine
early
and
call
at
six
o'clock
for
Miss
Torry
,
who
bring
Mrs.
Kenn
's
request
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
another
of
the
moral
result
of
this
idiotic
bazaar
,
"
Stephen
burst
forth
,
as
soon
as
Miss
Torry
have
leave
the
room
,
 
"
take
young
lady
from
the
duty
of
the
domestic
hearth
into
scene
of
dissipation
among
urn
-
rug
and
embroidered
reticule
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
what
be
the
proper
function
of
woman
,
if
it
be
not
to
make
reason
for
husband
to
stay
at
home
,
and
still
strong
reason
for
bachelor
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
if
this
go
on
much
long
,
the
bond
of
society
will
be
dissolve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
will
not
go
on
much
long
,
"
say
Lucy
,
laughing
,
"
for
the
bazaar
be
to
take
place
on
Monday
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
thank
Heaven
!
"
say
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kenn
himself
say
the
other
day
that
he
do
not
like
this
plan
of
make
vanity
do
the
work
of
charity
;
but
just
as
the
british
public
be
not
reasonable
enough
to
bear
direct
taxation
,
so
St.
Ogg
's
have
not
get
force
of
motive
enough
to
build
and
endow
school
without
call
in
the
force
of
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
say
so
?
"
say
little
Lucy
,
her
<EOS>
hazel
eye
open
wide
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
him
say
anything
of
that
kind
;
I
think
he
approve
of
what
we
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
approve
_
you
_
,
"
say
Stephen
,
smile
at
her
affectionately
;
"
your
conduct
in
go
out
to
-
night
look
vicious
,
I
own
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
benevolence
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
think
too
well
of
me
,
"
say
Lucy
,
shake
her
head
,
with
a
pretty
blush
,
and
there
the
subject
end
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
tacitly
understand
that
Stephen
would
not
come
in
the
evening
;
and
on
the
strength
of
that
tacit
understanding
he
make
his
morning
visit
the
long
,
not
say
good
-
bye
until
after
four
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
be
seat
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
alone
,
shortly
after
dinner
,
with
Minny
on
her
lap
,
have
leave
her
uncle
to
his
wine
and
his
nap
,
and
her
mother
to
the
compromise
between
knitting
and
nodding
,
which
,
when
there
be
no
company
,
she
always
carry
on
in
the
dining
-
room
till
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
Maggie
be
stoop
to
caress
the
tiny
silken
pet
,
and
comfort
him
for
his
mistress
's
absence
,
when
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
gravel
make
her
look
up
,
and
she
see
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
walk
up
the
garden
,
as
if
he
have
come
straight
from
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
unusual
to
see
him
so
soon
after
dinner
!
<EOS>
He
often
complain
that
their
dinner
-
hour
be
late
at
Park
House
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
he
be
,
in
his
black
dress
;
he
have
evidently
be
home
,
and
must
have
come
again
by
the
river
.
<EOS>
Maggie
feel
her
cheek
glow
and
her
heart
beat
;
it
be
natural
she
should
be
nervous
,
for
she
be
not
accustom
to
receive
visitor
alone
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
her
look
up
through
the
open
window
,
and
raise
his
hat
as
he
walk
toward
it
,
to
enter
that
way
instead
of
by
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
blush
too
,
and
certainly
look
as
foolish
as
a
young
man
of
some
wit
and
self
-
possession
can
be
expect
to
look
,
as
he
walk
in
with
a
roll
of
music
in
his
hand
,
and
say
,
with
an
air
of
hesitating
improvisation
,
    
<EOS>
"
You
be
surprised
to
see
me
again
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
I
ought
to
apologize
for
come
upon
you
by
surprise
,
but
I
want
to
come
into
the
town
,
and
I
get
our
man
to
row
me
;
so
I
think
I
would
bring
these
thing
from
the
"
Maid
of
Artois
"
for
your
cousin
;
I
forget
them
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
them
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Maggie
,
who
have
rise
confusedly
with
Minny
in
her
arm
,
and
now
,
not
quite
know
what
else
to
do
,
sit
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
lay
down
his
hat
,
with
the
music
,
which
roll
on
the
floor
,
and
sit
down
in
the
chair
close
by
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
do
so
before
,
and
both
he
and
Maggie
be
quite
aware
that
it
be
an
entirely
new
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
pamper
minion
!
"
say
Stephen
,
lean
to
pull
the
long
curly
ear
that
droop
over
Maggie
's
arm
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
suggestive
remark
,
and
as
the
speaker
do
not
follow
it
up
by
further
development
,
it
naturally
leave
the
conversation
at
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Stephen
like
some
action
in
a
dream
that
he
be
oblige
to
do
,
and
wonder
at
himself
all
the
while
,
 
to
go
on
stroke
Minny
's
head
.
<EOS>
yet
it
be
very
pleasant
;
he
only
wish
he
dare
look
at
Maggie
,
and
that
she
would
look
at
him
,
 
<EOS>
let
him
have
one
long
look
into
those
deep
,
strange
eye
of
her
,
and
then
he
would
be
satisfied
and
quite
reasonable
after
that
.
<EOS>
He
think
it
be
become
a
sort
of
monomania
with
him
,
to
want
that
long
look
from
Maggie
;
and
he
be
rack
his
invention
continually
to
find
out
some
mean
by
which
he
could
have
it
without
its
appear
singular
and
entail
subsequent
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
as
for
Maggie
,
she
have
no
distinct
thought
,
only
the
sense
of
a
presence
like
that
of
a
closely
hover
broad
-
winged
bird
in
the
darkness
,
for
she
be
unable
to
look
up
,
and
see
nothing
but
Minny
's
black
wavy
coat
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
must
end
some
time
<EOS>
,
perhaps
it
end
very
soon
,
and
only
_
seem
_
long
,
as
a
minute
's
dream
do
.
<EOS>
Stephen
at
last
sit
upright
sideways
in
his
chair
,
lean
one
hand
and
arm
over
the
back
and
look
at
Maggie
.
<EOS>
what
should
he
say
?
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
splendid
sunset
,
I
think
;
sha'n"t
<EOS>
you
go
out
and
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Maggie
.
<EOS>
then
courageously
raise
her
eye
and
look
out
of
the
window
,
"
if
I
be
not
play
cribbage
with
my
uncle
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
pause
;
during
which
Minny
be
stroke
again
,
but
have
sufficient
insight
not
to
be
grateful
for
it
,
to
growl
rather
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
like
sit
alone
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
rather
arch
look
come
over
Maggie
's
face
,
and
,
just
glance
at
Stephen
,
she
say
,
"
Would
it
be
quite
civil
to
say've
s
"
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
be
_
rather
a
dangerous
question
for
an
intruder
to
ask
,
"
say
Stephen
,
delight
with
that
glance
,
and
get
determined
to
stay
for
another
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
have
more
than
half
an
hour
to
yourself
after
I
be
go
,
"
he
add
,
take
out
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
Mr.
Deane
never
come
in
till
half
-
past
seven
.
"
  
<EOS>
another
pause
,
during
which
Maggie
look
steadily
out
of
the
window
,
till
by
a
great
effort
she
move
her
head
to
look
down
at
Minny
's
back
again
,
and
say
,
    
"
I
wish
Lucy
have
not
be
oblige
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
We
lose
our
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
new
voice
to
-
morrow
night
,
"
say
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
your
cousin
that
our
friend
Philip
Wakem
be
come
back
?
<EOS>
I
see
him
as
I
go
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
give
a
little
start
,
 
it
seem
hardly
more
than
a
vibration
that
pass
from
head
to
foot
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
but
the
new
image
summon
by
Philip
's
name
disperse
half
the
oppressive
spell
she
have
be
under
.
<EOS>
She
rise
from
her
chair
with
a
sudden
resolution
,
and
lay
Minny
on
his
cushion
,
go
to
reach
Lucy
's
large
work
-
basket
from
its
corner
.
<EOS>
Stephen
be
vex
and
disappointed
;
he
think
perhaps
Maggie
do
not
like
the
name
of
Wakem
to
be
mention
to
her
in
that
abrupt
way
,
for
he
now
recall
what
Lucy
have
tell
him
of
the
family
quarrel
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
to
stay
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Maggie
be
seat
herself
at
the
table
with
her
work
,
and
looking
chill
and
proud
;
and
he
 
<EOS>
he
look
like
a
simpleton
for
have
come
.
<EOS>
a
gratuitous
,
entirely
superfluous
visit
of
that
sort
be
sure
to
make
a
man
disagreeable
and
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
palpable
to
Maggie
's
thinking
that
he
have
dine
hastily
in
his
own
room
for
the
sake
of
set
off
again
and
find
her
alone
.
  
<EOS>
a
boyish
state
of
mind
for
an
accomplished
young
gentleman
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
not
without
legal
knowledge
!
<EOS>
but
a
reference
to
history
,
perhaps
,
may
make
it
not
incredible
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Maggie
's
ball
of
knitting
-
wool
roll
along
the
ground
,
and
she
start
up
to
reach
it
.
<EOS>
Stephen
rise
too
,
and
pick
up
the
ball
,
meet
her
with
a
vexed
,
complain
look
that
give
his
eye
quite
a
new
expression
to
Maggie
,
whose
own
eye
meet
them
as
he
present
the
ball
to
her
.

bye

"
say
Stephen
,
in
a
tone
that
have
the
same
beseeching
discontent
as
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
dare
not
put
out
his
hand
;
he
thrust
both
hand
into
his
tail
-
pocket
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
Maggie
think
she
have
perhaps
be
rude
.
  
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
stay
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
timidly
,
not
look
away
,
for
that
would
have
seem
rude
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
thank
you
,
"
say
Stephen
,
look
still
into
the
half
-
unwilling
,
half
-
fascinate
eye
,
as
a
thirsty
man
look
toward
the
track
of
the
distant
brook
.
<EOS>
"
the
boat
be
wait
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
tell
your
cousin
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
bring
the
music
,
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
"
and
that
Philip
be
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
<EOS>
(
Maggie
do
not
notice
Philip
's
name
this
time
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
come
out
a
little
way
into
the
garden
?
"
say
Stephen
,
in
a
still
gentle
tone
;
but
the
next
moment
he
be
vex
that
she
do
not
say
"
no
,
"
<EOS>
for
she
move
away
now
toward
the
open
window
,
and
he
be
oblige
to
take
his
hat
and
walk
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
but
he
think
of
something
to
make
him
amend
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
take
my
arm
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
low
tone
,
as
if
it
be
a
secret
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
strangely
win
to
most
woman
in
that
offer
of
the
firm
arm
;
the
help
be
not
want
physically
at
that
moment
,
but
the
sense
of
help
,
the
presence
of
strength
that
be
outside
them
and
yet
theirs
,
meet
a
continual
want
of
the
imagination
.
<EOS>
either
on
that
ground
or
some
other
,
Maggie
take
the
arm
.
<EOS>
and
they
walk
together
round
the
grassplot
and
under
the
drooping
green
of
the
laburnums
,
in
the
same
dim
,
dreamy
state
as
they
have
be
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
;
only
that
Stephen
have
have
the
look
he
long
for
,
without
yet
perceive
in
himself
the
symptom
of
return
reasonableness
,
and
Maggie
have
dart
thought
across
the
dimness
,
 
<EOS>
how
come
he
to
be
there
?
<EOS>
why
have
she
come
out
?
<EOS>
not
a
word
be
speak
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
,
each
would
have
be
less
intensely
conscious
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
care
of
this
step
,
"
say
Stephen
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
will
go
in
now
,
"
say
Maggie
,
feel
that
the
step
have
come
like
a
rescue
.
<EOS>
"
good
-
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
an
instant
she
have
withdraw
her
arm
,
and
be
run
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
reflect
that
this
sudden
action
would
only
add
to
the
embarrassing
recollection
of
the
last
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
thought
leave
for
that
.
<EOS>
She
only
throw
herself
into
the
low
arm
-
chair
,
and
burst
into
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Philip
,
Philip
,
I
wish
we
be
together
again
 
so
quietly
 
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
look
after
her
a
moment
,
then
go
on
to
the
boat
,
and
be
soon
land
at
the
wharf
.
<EOS>
He
spend
the
evening
in
the
billiard
-
room
,
smoke
one
cigar
after
another
,
and
lose
"
life
"
at
pool
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
not
leave
off
.
<EOS>
He
be
determine
not
to
think
,
 
not
to
admit
any
more
distinct
remembrance
than
be
urge
upon
him
by
the
perpetual
presence
of
Maggie
.
<EOS>
He
be
look
at
her
,
and
she
be
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
come
the
necessity
of
walk
home
in
the
cool
starlight
,
and
with
it
the
necessity
of
curse
his
own
folly
,
and
bitterly
determine
that
he
would
never
trust
himself
alone
with
Maggie
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
madness
;
he
be
in
love
,
thoroughly
attach
to
Lucy
,
and
engage
,
 
engage
as
strongly
as
an
honorable
man
nee
be
.
<EOS>
He
wish
he
have
never
see
this
Maggie
Tulliver
,
to
be
throw
into
a
fever
by
her
in
this
way
;
she
would
make
a
sweet
,
strange
,
troublesome
,
adorable
wife
to
some
man
or
other
,
but
he
would
never
have
choose
her
himself
.
<EOS>
do
she
feel
as
he
do
?
<EOS>
He
hope
she
do
 
not
.
<EOS>
He
ought
not
to
have
go
.
<EOS>
He
would
master
himself
in
future
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
himself
disagreeable
to
her
,
quarrel
with
her
perhaps
.
<EOS>
quarrel
with
her
?
<EOS>
be
it
possible
to
quarrel
with
a
creature
who
have
such
eye
,
 
defy
and
deprecate
,
contradict
and
cling
,
imperious
and
beseeching
,
  
full
of
delicious
opposite
?
<EOS>
to
see
such
a
creature
subdue
by
love
for
one
would
be
a
lot
worth
have
 
to
another
man
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
muttered
exclamation
which
end
this
inward
soliloquy
,
as
Stephen
throw
away
the
end
of
his
last
cigar
,
and
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
stalk
along
at
a
quieter
pace
through
the
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
of
a
benedictory
kind
.
    
<EOS>
Philip
Re
-
enter
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
be
very
wet
,
 
the
sort
of
morning
on
which
male
neighbor
who
have
no
imperative
occupation
at
home
be
likely
to
pay
their
fair
friend
an
illimitable
visit
.
<EOS>
the
rain
,
which
have
be
endurable
enough
for
the
walk
or
ride
one
way
,
be
sure
to
become
so
heavy
,
and
at
the
same
time
so
certain
to
clear
up
by
and
by
,
that
nothing
but
an
open
quarrel
can
abbreviate
the
visit
;
latent
detestation
will
not
do
at
all
.
<EOS>
and
if
people
happen
to
be
lover
,
what
can
be
so
delightful
,
in
England
,
as
a
rainy
morning
?
<EOS>
english
sunshine
be
dubious
;
bonnet
be
never
quite
secure
;
and
if
you
sit
down
on
the
grass
,
it
may
lead
to
catarrhs
.
<EOS>
but
the
rain
be
to
be
depend
on
.
<EOS>
You
gallop
through
it
in
a
mackintosh
,
and
presently
find
yourself
in
the
seat
you
like
best
,
 
a
little
above
or
a
little
below
the
one
on
which
your
goddess
sit
<EOS>
(
it
be
the
same
thing
to
the
metaphysical
mind
,
and
that
be
the
reason
why
woman
be
at
once
worship
and
look
down
upon
)
,
with
a
satisfactory
confidence
that
there
will
be
no
lady
-
caller
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stephen
will
come
earlier
this
morning
,
I
know
,
"
say
Lucy
;
"
he
always
do
when
it
be
rainy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
She
be
angry
with
Stephen
;
she
begin
to
think
she
should
dislike
him
;
and
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
rain
,
she
would
have
go
to
her
aunt
<EOS>
Glegg
's
this
morning
,
and
so
have
avoid
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
must
find
some
reason
for
remain
out
of
the
room
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
but
Stephen
do
not
come
earlier
,
and
there
be
another
visitor
 
a
near
neighbor
 
who
precede
him
.
<EOS>
when
Philip
enter
the
room
,
he
be
go
merely
to
bow
to
Maggie
,
feel
that
their
acquaintance
be
a
secret
which
he
be
bind
not
to
betray
;
but
when
she
advance
toward
him
and
put
out
her
hand
,
he
guess
at
once
that
Lucy
have
be
take
into
her
confidence
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
moment
of
some
agitation
to
both
,
though
Philip
have
spend
many
hour
in
prepare
for
it
;
but
like
all
person
who
have
pass
through
life
with
little
expectation
of
sympathy
,
he
seldom
lose
his
self
-
control
,
and
shrink
with
the
most
sensitive
pride
from
any
noticeable
betrayal
of
emotion
.
<EOS>
a
little
extra
paleness
,
a
little
tension
of
the
nostril
when
he
speak
,
and
the
voice
pitch
in
rather
a
high
key
,
that
to
stranger
would
seem
expressive
of
cold
indifference
,
be
all
the
sign
Philip
usually
give
of
an
inward
drama
that
be
not
without
its
fierceness
.
<EOS>
but
Maggie
,
who
have
little
more
power
of
conceal
the
impression
make
upon
her
than
if
she
have
be
construct
of
musical
string
,
feel
her
eye
get
large
with
tear
as
they
take
each
other
's
hand
in
silence
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
painful
tear
;
they
have
rather
something
of
the
same
origin
as
the
tear
woman
and
child
shed
when
they
have
find
some
protection
to
cling
to
and
look
back
on
the
threaten
danger
.
<EOS>
for
Philip
,
who
a
little
while
ago
be
associate
continually
in
Maggie
's
mind
with
the
sense
that
Tom
may
reproach
her
with
some
justice
,
have
now
,
in
this
short
space
,
become
a
sort
of
outward
conscience
to
her
,
that
she
may
fly
to
for
rescue
and
strength
.
<EOS>
Her
tranquil
,
tender
affection
for
Philip
,
with
its
root
deep
down
in
her
childhood
,
and
its
memory
of
long
quiet
talk
confirm
by
distinct
successive
impression
the
first
instinctive
bias
,
 
the
fact
that
in
him
the
appeal
be
more
strongly
to
her
pity
and
womanly
devotedness
than
to
her
vanity
or
other
egoistic
excitability
of
her
nature
,
 
seem
now
to
make
a
sort
of
sacred
place
,
a
sanctuary
where
she
could
find
refuge
from
an
alluring
influence
which
the
good
part
of
herself
must
resist
;
which
must
bring
horrible
tumult
within
,
wretchedness
without
.
<EOS>
this
new
sense
of
her
relation
to
Philip
nullify
the
anxious
scruple
she
would
otherwise
have
feel
,
lest
she
should
overstep
the
limit
of
intercourse
with
him
that
Tom
would
sanction
;
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
,
and
feel
the
tear
in
her
eye
without
any
consciousness
of
an
inward
check
.
<EOS>
the
scene
be
just
what
Lucy
expect
,
and
her
kind
heart
delight
in
bring
Philip
and
Maggie
together
again
;
though
,
even
with
all
_
her
_
regard
for
Philip
,
she
could
not
resist
the
impression
that
her
cousin
Tom
have
some
excuse
for
feel
shock
at
the
physical
incongruity
between
the
two
,
 
a
prosaic
person
like
cousin
Tom
,
who
do
not
like
poetry
and
fairy
tale
.
<EOS>
but
she
begin
to
speak
as
soon
as
possible
,
to
set
them
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
good
and
virtuous
of
you
,
"
she
say
,
in
her
pretty
treble
,
like
the
low
conversational
note
of
little
bird
,
"
to
come
so
soon
after
your
arrival
.
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
,
I
think
I
will
pardon
you
for
run
away
in
an
inopportune
manner
,
and
give
your
friend
no
notice
.
<EOS>
come
and
sit
down
here
,
"
she
go
on
,
place
the
chair
that
would
suit
him
good
,
"
and
you
shall
find
yourself
treat
mercifully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
govern
well
,
Miss
Deane
,
"
say
Philip
,
as
he
seat
himself
,
"
because
no
one
will
ever
believe
in
your
severity
.
<EOS>
People
will
always
encourage
themselves
in
misdemeanor
by
the
certainty
that
you
will
be
indulgent
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
give
some
playful
contradiction
,
but
Philip
do
not
hear
what
it
be
,
for
he
have
naturally
turn
toward
Maggie
,
and
she
be
look
at
him
with
that
open
,
affectionate
scrutiny
which
we
give
to
a
friend
from
whom
we
have
be
long
separate
.
<EOS>
what
a
moment
their
parting
have
be
!
<EOS>
and
Philip
feel
as
if
he
be
only
in
the
morrow
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
feel
this
so
keenly
,
 
with
such
intense
,
detailed
remembrance
,
with
such
passionate
revival
of
all
that
have
be
say
and
look
in
their
last
conversation
,
 
that
with
that
jealousy
and
distrust
which
in
diffident
nature
be
almost
inevitably
link
with
a
strong
feeling
,
he
think
he
read
in
Maggie
's
glance
and
manner
the
evidence
of
a
change
.
<EOS>
the
very
fact
that
he
fear
and
half
expect
it
would
be
sure
to
make
this
think
rush
in
,
in
the
absence
of
positive
proof
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
have
a
great
holiday
,
be
I
not
?
"
say
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
be
like
a
fairy
godmother
;
she
have
turn
me
from
a
drudge
into
a
princess
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
I
do
nothing
but
indulge
myself
all
day
long
,
and
she
always
find
out
what
I
want
before
I
know
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
she
be
the
happy
for
have
you
,
then
,
"
say
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
well
than
a
whole
menagerie
of
pet
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
you
look
well
.
<EOS>
You
be
benefit
by
the
change
.
"
  
<EOS>
artificial
conversation
of
this
sort
go
on
a
little
while
,
till
Lucy
,
determine
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
exclaim
,
with
a
good
imitation
of
annoyance
,
that
she
have
forget
something
,
and
be
quickly
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
moment
Maggie
and
Philip
lean
forward
,
and
the
hand
be
clasp
again
,
with
a
look
of
sad
contentment
,
like
that
of
friend
who
meet
in
the
memory
of
recent
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
my
brother
<EOS>
I
wish
to
see
you
,
Philip
;
I
ask
him
to
release
me
from
my
promise
,
and
he
consent
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
in
her
impulsiveness
,
want
Philip
to
know
at
once
the
position
they
must
hold
toward
each
other
;
but
she
check
herself
.
<EOS>
the
thing
that
have
happen
since
he
have
speak
of
his
love
for
her
be
so
painful
that
she
shrink
from
be
the
first
to
allude
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
seem
almost
like
an
injury
toward
Philip
even
to
mention
her
brother
,
 
her
brother
,
who
have
insult
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
think
too
entirely
of
her
to
be
sensitive
on
any
other
point
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
we
can
at
least
be
friend
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
hinder
that
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
not
your
father
object
?
"
say
Maggie
,
withdraw
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
give
you
up
on
any
ground
but
your
own
wish
,
Maggie
,
"
say
Philip
,
color
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
point
on
which
I
should
always
resist
my
father

use
to
tell
you

<EOS>
that

be
one

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
there
be
nothing
to
hinder
our
be
friend
,
Philip

see
each
other
and
talk
to
each
other
while
I
be
here
;
I
shall
soon
go
away
again
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
go
very
soon

to
a
new
situation
.

<EOS>
"
be
that
inevitable
,
Maggie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
must
not
stay
here
long
.
<EOS>
It
would
unfit
me
for
the
life
I
must
begin
again
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
live
in
dependence
,
 
I
can
not
live
with
my
brother
,
though
he
be
very
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
would
like
to
provide
for
me
;
but
that
would
be
intolerable
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
silent
a
few
moment
,
and
then
say
,
in
that
high
,
feeble
voice
which
with
him
indicate
the
resolute
suppression
of
emotion
,
    
"
be
there
no
other
alternative
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
be
that
life
,
away
from
those
who
love
you
,
the
only
one
you
will
allow
yourself
to
look
forward
to
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Philip
,
"
she
say
,
look
at
him
pleadingly
,
as
if
she
entreat
him
to
believe
that
she
be
compel
to
this
course
.
<EOS>
"
at
least
,
as
thing
be
;
I
do
not
know
what
may
be
in
year
to
come
.
<EOS>
but
I
begin
to
think
there
can
never
come
much
happiness
to
me
from
love
;
I
have
always
have
so
much
pain
mingle
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
make
myself
a
world
outside
it
,
as
man
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
you
be
return
to
your
old
thought
in
a
new
form
,
Maggie
,
 
the
thought
I
use
to
combat
,
"
say
Philip
,
with
a
slight
tinge
of
bitterness
.
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
find
out
a
mode
of
renunciation
that
will
be
an
escape
from
pain
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
again
,
there
be
no
such
escape
possible
except
by
pervert
or
mutilate
one
's
nature
.
<EOS>
what
would
become
of
me
,
if
I
try
to
escape
from
pain
?
<EOS>
scorn
and
cynicism
would
be
my
only
opium
;
unless
I
could
fall
into
some
kind
of
conceited
madness
,
and
fancy
myself
a
favorite
of
Heaven
because
I
be
not
a
favorite
with
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bitterness
have
take
on
some
impetuosity
as
Philip
go
on
speak
;
the
word
be
evidently
an
outlet
for
some
immediate
feeling
of
his
own
,
as
well
as
an
answer
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
pain
press
on
him
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
shrink
with
proud
delicacy
from
the
faint
allusion
to
the
word
of
love
,
of
plighted
love
that
have
pass
between
them
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
seem
to
him
like
remind
Maggie
of
a
promise
;
it
would
have
have
for
him
something
of
the
baseness
of
compulsion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
dwell
on
the
fact
that
he
himself
have
not
change
;
for
that
too
would
have
have
the
air
of
an
appeal
.
<EOS>
His
love
for
Maggie
be
stamp
,
even
more
than
the
rest
of
his
experience
,
with
the
exaggerated
sense
that
he
be
an
exception
,
 
that
she
,
that
every
one
,
see
him
in
the
light
of
an
exception
.
  
<EOS>
but
Maggie
be
conscience
-
stricken
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Philip
,
"
she
say
,
with
her
childish
contrition
when
he
use
to
chide
her
,
"
you
be
right
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
do
always
think
too
much
of
my
own
feeling
,
and
not
enough
of
other
"
,
 
not
enough
of
yours
.
<EOS>
I
have
nee
have
you
always
to
find
fault
with
me
and
teach
me
;
so
many
thing
have
come
true
that
you
use
to
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
be
rest
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
lean
her
head
on
her
hand
and
look
at
Philip
with
half
-
penitent
dependent
affection
,
as
she
say
this
;
while
he
be
return
her
gaze
with
an
expression
that
,
to
her
consciousness
,
gradually
become
less
vague
,
 
become
charge
with
a
specific
recollection
.
<EOS>
had
his
mind
fly
back
to
something
that
_
she
_
now
remember
,
 
something
about
a
lover
of
Lucy
's
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
thought
that
make
her
shudder
;
it
give
new
definiteness
to
her
present
position
,
and
to
the
tendency
of
what
have
happen
the
evening
before
.
<EOS>
She
move
her
arm
from
the
table
,
urge
to
change
her
position
by
that
positive
physical
oppression
at
the
heart
that
sometimes
accompany
a
sudden
mental
pang
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
have
something
happen
?
"
<EOS>
Philip
say
,
in
inexpressible
anxiety
,
his
imagination
be
only
too
ready
to
weave
everything
that
be
fatal
to
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
nothing
,
"
say
Maggie
,
rouse
her
latent
will
.
<EOS>
Philip
must
not
have
that
odious
think
in
his
mind
;
she
would
banish
it
from
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
"
she
repeat
,
"
except
in
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
You
use
to
say
I
should
feel
the
effect
of
my
starve
life
,
as
you
call
it
;
and
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
eager
in
my
enjoyment
of
music
and
all
luxury
,
now
they
be
come
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
up
her
work
and
occupy
herself
resolutely
,
while
Philip
watch
her
,
really
in
doubt
whether
she
have
anything
more
than
this
general
allusion
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
in
Maggie
's
character
to
be
agitate
by
vague
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
but
soon
there
come
a
violent
well
-
know
ring
at
the
door
-
bell
resound
through
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
a
startling
announcement
!
<EOS>
"
say
Maggie
,
quite
mistress
of
herself
,
though
not
without
some
inward
flutter
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
where
Lucy
be
.
"
  
Lucy
have
not
be
deaf
to
the
signal
,
and
after
an
interval
long
enough
for
a
few
solicitous
but
not
hurried
inquiry
,
she
herself
usher
Stephen
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
old
fellow
,
"
he
say
,
go
straight
up
to
Philip
and
shake
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
bow
to
Maggie
in
passing
,
"
it
be
glorious
to
have
you
back
again
;
only
I
wish
you
would
conduct
yourself
a
little
less
like
a
sparrow
with
a
residence
on
the
house
-
top
,
and
not
go
in
and
out
constantly
without
let
the
servant
know
.
<EOS>
this
be
about
the
twentieth
time
I
have
have
to
scamper
up
those
countless
stair
to
that
painting
-
room
of
yours
,
all
to
no
purpose
,
because
your
people
think
you
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
such
incident
embitter
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
so
few
visitor
,
it
seem
hardly
worth
while
to
leave
notice
of
my
exit
and
entrance
,
"
say
Philip
,
feel
rather
oppress
just
then
by
Stephen
's
bright
strong
presence
and
strong
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
quite
well
this
morning
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
"
say
Stephen
,
turn
to
Maggie
with
stiff
politeness
,
and
put
out
his
hand
with
the
air
of
fulfil
a
social
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
give
the
tip
of
her
finger
,
and
say
,
"
quite
well
,
thank
you
,
"
in
a
tone
of
proud
indifference
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
eye
be
watch
them
keenly
;
but
Lucy
be
use
to
see
variation
in
their
manner
to
each
other
,
and
only
think
with
regret
that
there
be
some
natural
antipathy
which
every
now
and
then
surmount
their
mutual
good
-
will
.
<EOS>
"
Maggie
be
not
the
sort
of
woman
Stephen
admire
,
and
she
be
irritate
by
something
in
him
which
she
interpret
as
conceit
,
"
be
the
silent
observation
that
account
for
everything
to
guileless
Lucy
.
<EOS>
Stephen
and
Maggie
have
no
sooner
complete
this
study
greeting
than
each
feel
hurt
by
the
other
's
coldness
.
<EOS>
and
Stephen
,
while
rattle
on
in
question
to
Philip
about
his
recent
sketching
expedition
,
be
think
all
the
more
about
Maggie
because
he
be
not
draw
her
into
the
conversation
as
he
have
invariably
do
before
.
<EOS>
"
Maggie
and
Philip
be
not
look
happy
,
"
think
Lucy
;
"
this
first
interview
have
be
saddening
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
people
who
have
not
be
gallop
,
"
she
say
to
Stephen
,
"
be
all
a
little
damp
by
the
rain
.
<EOS>
let
us
have
some
music
.
<EOS>
We
ought
to
take
advantage
of
have
Philip
and
you
together
.
<EOS>
give
us
the
duet
in
"
Masaniello
"
<EOS>
;
Maggie
have
not
hear
that
,
and
I
know
it
will
suit
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
then
,
"
say
Stephen
,
go
toward
the
piano
,
and
give
a
foretaste
of
the
tune
in
his
deep
"
brum
-
brum
,
"
very
pleasant
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
please
,
Philip
,
 
you
play
the
accompaniment
,
"
say
Lucy
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
can
go
on
with
my
work
.
<EOS>
You
_
will
_
like
to
play
,
sha'n"t
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
add
,
with
a
pretty
,
inquire
look
,
anxious
,
as
usual
,
lest
she
should
have
propose
what
be
not
pleasant
to
another
;
but
with
yearning
toward
her
unfinished
embroidery
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
have
brighten
at
the
proposition
,
for
there
be
no
feeling
,
perhaps
,
except
the
extreme
of
fear
and
grief
,
that
do
not
find
relief
in
music
,
 
that
do
not
make
a
man
sing
or
play
the
well
;
and
Philip
have
an
abundance
of
pen
-
up
feeling
at
this
moment
,
as
complex
as
any
trio
or
quartet
that
be
ever
mean
to
express
love
and
jealousy
and
resignation
and
fierce
suspicion
,
all
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
"
he
say
,
seat
himself
at
the
piano
,
"
it
be
a
way
of
eke
out
one
's
imperfect
life
and
be
three
people
at
once
,
 
to
sing
and
make
the
piano
sing
,
and
hear
them
both
all
the
while
,
 
or
else
to
sing
and
paint
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
there
you
be
an
enviable
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
with
my
hand
,
"
say
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
that
have
generally
be
observe
in
man
of
great
administrative
capacity
,
I
believe
,
 
a
tendency
to
predominance
of
the
reflective
power
in
me
!
<EOS>
have
not
you
observe
that
,
Miss
Tulliver
?
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
have
fall
by
mistake
into
his
habit
of
playful
appeal
to
Maggie
,
and
she
could
not
repress
the
answer
flush
and
epigram
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
have
_
observe
a
tendency
to
predominance
,
"
she
say
,
smile
;
and
Philip
<EOS>
at
that
moment
devoutly
hope
that
she
find
the
tendency
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
"
say
Lucy
;
"
music
,
music
!
<EOS>
We
will
discuss
each
other
's
quality
another
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
always
try
in
vain
to
go
on
with
her
work
when
music
begin
.
<EOS>
She
try
harder
than
ever
to
-
day
;
for
the
thought
that
Stephen
know
how
much
she
care
for
his
singing
be
one
that
no
longer
rouse
a
merely
playful
resistance
;
and
she
know
,
too
,
that
it
be
his
habit
always
to
stand
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
of
no
use
;
she
soon
throw
her
work
down
,
and
all
her
intention
be
lose
in
the
vague
state
of
emotion
produce
by
the
inspire
duet
,
 
emotion
that
seem
to
make
her
at
once
strong
and
weak
;
strong
for
all
enjoyment
,
weak
for
all
resistance
.
<EOS>
when
the
strain
pass
into
the
minor
,
she
half
start
from
her
seat
with
the
sudden
thrill
of
that
change
.
<EOS>
poor
Maggie
!
<EOS>
She
look
very
beautiful
when
her
soul
be
be
play
on
in
this
way
by
the
inexorable
power
of
sound
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
see
the
slight
perceptible
quivering
through
her
whole
frame
as
she
lean
a
little
forward
,
clasp
her
hand
as
if
to
steady
herself
;
while
her
eye
dilate
and
brighten
into
that
wide
-
open
,
childish
expression
of
wonder
delight
which
always
come
back
in
her
happy
moment
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
at
other
time
have
always
be
at
the
piano
when
Maggie
be
look
in
this
way
,
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
steal
up
to
her
and
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
too
,
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
now
and
then
round
the
open
book
on
the
desk
,
and
feel
that
he
have
never
before
see
her
under
so
strong
an
influence
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
,
more
!
"
say
Lucy
,
when
the
duet
have
be
encore
.
<EOS>
"
something
spirit
again
.
<EOS>
Maggie
always
say
she
like
a
great
rush
of
sound

<EOS>
"
It
must
be
"
let
us
take
the
road
,
"
then
,
"
say
Stephen
,
 
"
so
suitable
for
a
wet
morning
.
<EOS>
but
be
you
prepared
to
abandon
the
most
sacred
duty
of
life
,
and
come
and
sing
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
"
say
Lucy
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
look
out
the
"

dingy

draw
out
the
canterbury
.

Lucy
,

that
his
finger
be
wander
over
the
key

"
what
be
that
you

fall
into

something
delicious

I
do

<EOS>
"
do
not
you
know
that
?
"
say
Philip
,
bring
out
the
tune
more
definitely
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
from
the
"
Sonnambula
'
 
"
ah
!
perchè
non
posso
odiarti
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
the
opera
,
but
it
appear
the
tenor
be
tell
the
heroine
that
he
shall
always
love
her
though
she
may
forsake
him
.

You
have
hear
me
sing
it
to
the
english
word
,
"
I
love
thee
still

It
be
not
quite
unintentionally
that
Philip
have
wander
into
this
song
,
which
may
be
an
indirect
expression
to
Maggie
of
what
he
could
not
prevail
on
himself
to
say
to
her
directly
.
<EOS>
Her
ear
have
be
open
to
what
he
be
say
,
and
when
he
begin
to
sing
,
she
understand
the
plaintive
passion
of
the
music
.
<EOS>
that
plead
tenor
have
no
very
fine
quality
as
a
voice
,
but
it
be
not
quite
new
to
her
;
it
have
sing
to
her
by
snatch
,
in
a
subdued
way
,
among
the
grassy
walk
and
hollow
,
and
underneath
the
lean
ash
-
tree
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
some
reproach
in
the
word
;
do
Philip
mean
that
?
<EOS>
She
wish
she
have
assure
him
more
distinctly
in
their
conversation
that
she
desire
not
to
renew
the
hope
of
love
between
them
,
_
only
_
because
it
clash
with
her
inevitable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
She
be
touch
,
not
thrill
by
the
song
;
it
suggest
distinct
memory
and
thought
,
and
bring
quiet
regret
in
the
place
of
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
way
with
you
tenor
,
"
say
Stephen
,
who
be
wait
with
music
in
his
hand
while
Philip
finish
the
song
.
<EOS>
"
You
demoralize
the
fair
sex
by
warble
your
sentimental
love
and
constancy
under
all
sort
of
vile
treatment
.
<EOS>
nothing
short
of
have
your
head
serve
up
in
a
dish
like
that
mediæval
tenor
or
troubadour
,
would
prevent
you
from
express
your
entire
resignation
.
<EOS>
I
must
administer
an
antidote
,
while
Miss
Deane
prepare
to
tear
herself
away
from
her
bobbin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
roll
out
,
with
saucy
energy
,
      
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
,
waste
in
despair
,
  
die
because
a
woman
's
fair
?
"
  
and
seem
to
make
all
the
air
in
the
room
alive
with
a
new
influence
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
always
proud
of
what
Stephen
do
,
go
toward
the
piano
with
laughing
,
admire
look
at
him
;
and
Maggie
,
in
spite
of
her
resistance
to
the
spirit
of
the
song
and
to
the
singer
,
be
take
hold
of
and
shake
by
the
invisible
influence
,
 
be
bear
along
by
a
wave
too
strong
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
angrily
resolve
not
to
betray
herself
,
she
seize
her
work
,
and
go
on
make
false
stitch
and
prick
her
finger
with
much
perseverance
,
not
look
up
or
take
notice
of
what
be
go
forward
,
until
all
the
three
voice
unite
in
"
let
us
take
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
there
would
have
be
a
subtle
,
steal
gratification
in
her
mind
if
she
have
know
how
entirely
this
saucy
,
defiant
Stephen
be
occupy
with
her
;
how
he
be
pass
rapidly
from
a
determination
to
treat
her
with
ostentatious
indifference
to
an
irritate
desire
for
some
sign
of
inclination
from
her
,
 
some
interchange
of
subdued
word
or
look
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
he
find
an
opportunity
,
when
they
have
pass
to
the
music
of
"
The
temp
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Maggie
,
feel
the
need
of
a
footstool
,
be
walk
across
the
room
to
get
one
,
when
Stephen
,
who
be
not
singe
just
then
,
and
be
conscious
of
all
her
movement
,
guess
her
want
,
and
fly
to
anticipate
her
,
lift
the
footstool
with
an
entreating
look
at
her
,
which
make
it
impossible
not
to
return
a
glance
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
have
the
footstool
place
carefully
by
a
too
self
-
confident
personage
,
 
not
_
any
_
self
-
confident
personage
,
but
one
in
particular
,
who
suddenly
look
humble
and
anxious
,
and
linger
,
bend
still
,
to
ask
if
there
be
not
some
draught
in
that
position
between
the
window
and
the
fireplace
,
and
if
he
may
not
be
allow
to
move
the
work
-
table
for
her
,
 
these
thing
will
summon
a
little
of
the
too
ready
,
traitorous
tenderness
into
a
woman
's
eye
,
compel
as
she
be
in
her
girlish
time
to
learn
her
life
-
lesson
in
very
trivial
language
.
<EOS>
and
to
Maggie
such
thing
have
not
be
every
-
day
incident
,
but
be
a
new
element
in
her
life
,
and
find
her
keen
appetite
for
homage
quite
fresh
.
<EOS>
that
tone
of
gentle
solicitude
oblige
her
to
look
at
the
face
that
be
bent
toward
her
,
and
to
say
,
"
no
,
thank
you
"
;
and
nothing
could
prevent
that
mutual
glance
from
be
delicious
to
both
,
as
it
have
be
the
evening
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
but
an
ordinary
act
of
politeness
in
Stephen
;
it
have
hardly
take
two
minute
;
and
Lucy
,
who
be
singe
,
scarcely
notice
it
.
<EOS>
but
to
Philip
's
mind
,
fill
already
with
a
vague
anxiety
that
be
likely
to
find
a
definite
ground
for
itself
in
any
trivial
incident
,
this
sudden
eagerness
in
Stephen
,
and
the
change
in
Maggie
's
face
,
which
be
plainly
reflect
a
beam
from
his
,
seem
so
strong
a
contrast
with
the
previous
overwrought
sign
of
indifference
,
as
to
be
charge
with
painful
meaning
.
<EOS>
Stephen
's
voice
,
pour
in
again
,
jar
upon
his
nervous
susceptibility
as
if
it
have
be
the
clang
of
sheet
-
iron
,
and
he
feel
inclined
to
make
the
piano
shriek
in
utter
discord
.
<EOS>
He
have
really
see
no
communicable
ground
for
suspect
any
ususual
feeling
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
;
his
own
reason
tell
him
so
,
and
he
want
to
go
home
at
once
that
he
may
reflect
coolly
on
these
false
image
,
till
he
have
convince
himself
of
their
nullity
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
again
,
he
want
to
stay
as
long
as
Stephen
stay
,
 
always
to
be
present
when
Stephen
be
present
with
Maggie
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
poor
Philip
so
natural
,
nay
,
inevitable
,
that
any
man
who
be
near
Maggie
should
fall
in
love
with
her
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
promise
of
happiness
for
her
if
she
be
beguile
into
love
Stephen
Guest
;
and
this
thought
embolden
Philip
to
view
his
own
love
for
her
in
the
light
of
a
less
unequal
offering
.
<EOS>
He
be
begin
to
play
very
falsely
under
this
deafen
inward
tumult
,
and
Lucy
be
look
at
him
in
astonishment
,
when
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
entrance
to
summon
them
to
lunch
come
as
an
excuse
for
abruptly
break
off
the
music
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Mr.
Philip
!
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
when
they
enter
the
dining
-
room
,
"
I
have
not
see
you
for
a
long
while

<EOS>
Your
father

he

<EOS>
I
go
after
him
to
the
office
the
other

they

out

He

Philip

<EOS>
"
I
believe
so

Philip

rather

at

sudden
interest
in
his

pursuit

ah
!

Mr.
Deane

yes

"
  
"
ah

continue
Mr.

,
as
he
dispense
the
pigeonpie

"
he
must
find
farm
a
heavy
item

an
expensive
hobby

<EOS>
I
never
have
a
hobby
myself
,
never
would
give
in
to
that
.
<EOS>
and
the
bad
of
all
hobby
be
those
that
people
think
they
can
get
money
at
.
<EOS>
They
shoot
their
money
down
like
corn
out
of
a
sack
then

"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
feel
a
little
nervous
under
her
father
's
apparently
gratuitous
criticism
of
Mr.
Wakem
's
expenditure
.
<EOS>
but
it
cease
there
,
and
Mr.
Deane
become
unusually
silent
and
meditative
during
his
luncheon
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
accustomed
to
watch
all
indication
in
her
father
,
and
have
reason
,
which
have
recently
become
strong
,
for
an
extra
interest
in
what
refer
to
the
Wakems
,
feel
an
unusual
curiosity
to
know
what
have
prompt
her
father
's
question
.
<EOS>
His
subsequent
silence
make
her
suspect
there
have
be
some
special
reason
for
them
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
idea
in
her
head
,
she
resort
to
her
usual
plan
when
she
want
to
tell
or
ask
her
father
anything
particular
:
she
find
a
reason
for
her
aunt
Tulliver
to
leave
the
dining
-
room
after
dinner
,
and
seat
herself
on
a
small
stool
at
her
father
's
knee
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
,
under
those
circumstance
,
consider
that
he
taste
some
of
the
most
agreeable
moment
his
merit
have
purchase
him
in
life
,
notwithstanding
that
Lucy
,
dislike
to
have
her
hair
powder
with
snuff
,
usually
begin
by
master
his
snuff
-
box
on
such
occasion

you

she

she
bring
up
her

open
the
large
finger

clutch
the
snuff

"
not
yet

Mr.

glance
at
the
reward

what
do

you

he
add
,
pinch
the
dimpled
chin
fondly
,

to
coax
some
more
sovereign
out
of
my
pocket
for
your

?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
have
no

to
know

make
you
ask
Philip
Wakem
about
his
father
's
farming
to
-
day
,
papa
?
<EOS>
It
seem
rather
odd
,
because
you
never
hardly
say
anything
to
him
about
his
father
;
and
why
should
you
care
about
Mr.
Wakem
's
lose
money
by
his
hobby

"
something
to
do
with
business

say
Mr.

,
wave
his
hand
,
as
if
to
repel
intrusion
into
that
mystery

<EOS>
"
but
,
papa
,
you
always
say
Mr.
Wakem
have
bring
Philip
up
like
a
girl

how
come
you
to
think
you
should
get
any
business
knowledge
out
of
him

<EOS>
those
abrupt
question
sound
rather
oddly

<EOS>
Philip
think
them
queer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
nonsense
,
child
!
"
say
Mr.
Deane
,
willing
to
justify
his
social
demeanor
,
with
which
he
have
take
some
pain
in
his
upward
progress
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
report
that
Wakem

mill

well

it

I
want
to
see
if
your
friend
Philip
would
let
anything
out
about
his
father

be
tired
of
farming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
Would
you
buy
the
mill

papa

if

would
part

Lucy

eagerly

tell
me
everything

here
,
you
shall
have
your
snuff

box
if
you
will
tell
me

<EOS>
because
Maggie
say
all
their
heart
be
set
on
Tom
's
get
back
the
mill
some
time

<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
last
thing
her

say
to
Tom

that
he
must
get
back

"
  
"
Hush

you
little

Mr.

himself

You
must
not

a
word
about
this

you
hear

<EOS>
there
be
very
little
chance
of
their
get
the
mill

of

anybody
be

it
out

if
he
know
that

it
again

he
would
be

natural

after
what

He
behave
well
enough

will
keep

there
will
not

harm
do

to
tell
the
truth
,
I
think
there

conversation

have
just
overhear
between
Lucy
and
her
father
she
have
contrive
to
have
a
private
interview
with
Philip
during
a
visit
of
Maggie

to
her
aunt
Glegg

<EOS>
for
a
day
and
a
night
Philip
turn
over
in
his
mind
with
restless
agitation
all
that
Lucy
have
tell
him
in
that
interview
,
till
he
have
thoroughly
resolve
on
a
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
He
think
he
see
before
him
now
a
possibility
of
alter
his
position
with
respect
to
Maggie
,
and
remove
at
least
one
obstacle
between
them
.
<EOS>
He
lay
his
plan
and
calculate
all
his
move
with
the
fervid
deliberation
of
a
chess
-
player
in
the
day
of
his
first
ardor
,
and
be
amazed
himself
at
his
sudden
genius
as
a
tactician

<EOS>
His
plan
be
as
bold
as
it
be
thoroughly
calculate
.
<EOS>
have
watch
for
a
moment
when
his
father
have
nothing
more
urgent
on
his
hand
than
the
newspaper
,
he
go
behind
him
,
lay
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
say
,
    
"
Father
,
will
you
come
up
into
my
sanctum
,
and
look
at

kindly
at

come
along

as

,
the

<EOS>
He
like
to
remind
himself
and
his

too
that
his
fatherly
indulgence
have
provide
the
accommodation
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
good

emily
would
have
nothing
to
reproach
him
with

,
if
she
come
back
again
from
her
grave

"
come

he
say
,
put
his
double
eye

glass
over
his
nose
,
and
seat
himself
to
take
a
general
view
while
he
rest
,
"
you
have
get
a
famous
show
here
.
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
I
do
not
see
that
your

not
as
good
as
that
London

much

<EOS>
Philip
shake
his
head
and
smile
.
<EOS>
He
have
seat
himself
on
his
painting

stool
,
and
have
take
a
lead
pencil
in
his
hand
,
with
which
he
be
make
strong
mark
to
counteract
the
sense
of
tremulousness
.
<EOS>
He
watch
his
father
get
up
,
and
walk
slowly
round
,
good
-
naturedly
dwell
on
the
picture
much
longer
than
his
amount
of
genuine
taste
for
landscape
would
have
prompt
,
till
he
stop
before
a
stand
on
which
two
picture
be
place
,
 
one
much
large
than
the
other
,
the
small
one
in

leather
case

<EOS>
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
have
you
here
?
"
say
Wakem
,
startle
by
a
sudden
transition
from
landscape
to
portrait
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
leave
off
figure

<EOS>
who
be
these
?

<EOS>
"
They
be
the

person
,
"
say
Philip
,
with
calm
promptness
,
"
at
different
age

<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
person
?
"
say
Wakem
,
sharply
fix
his
eye
with
a
grow
look
of
suspicion
on
the
large
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
the
small
one
be
something
like
what
she
be
when
I
be
at
school
with
her
brother
at
King
's
Lorton
;
the
large
one
be
not
quite
so
good
a
likeness
of
what
she
be
when
I
come
from
abroad

"
  
<EOS>
Wakem
turn
round
fiercely
,
with
a
flushed
face
,
let
his
eye
-
glass
fall
,
and
look
at
his
son
with
a
savage
expression
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
be
ready
to
strike
that
dare
feebleness
from
the
stool
.
<EOS>
but
he
throw
himself
into
the
armchair
again
,
and
thrust
his
hand
into
his
trouser
-
pocket
,
still
look
angrily
at
his
son
,
however
.
<EOS>
Philip
do
not
return
the
look
,
but
sit
quietly
watch
the
point
of
his
pencil
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
mean
to
say
,
then
,
that
you
have
have
any
acquaintance
with
her
since
you
come
from
abroad

say
Wakem
,
at
last
,
with
that
vain
effort
which
rage
always
make
to
throw
as
much
punishment
as
it
desire
to
inflict
into
word
and
tone
,
since
blow
be
forbid

<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
see
a
great
deal
of
her
for
a
whole
year
before
her
father
's
death

<EOS>
We
meet
often
in
that
thicket
 
<EOS>
the
Red
deep
 
near
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
dearly
;
I
shall
never
love
any
other
woman

I
have
think
of
her
ever
since
she
be
a
little
girl

go
on
,
sir
!

and
you
have
correspond
with
her
all
this
while

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
I
never
tell
her
I
love
her
till
just
before
we
part
,
and
she
promise
her
brother
not
to
see
me
again
or
to
correspond
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
she
love
me

would
consent

marry
me

if
she
would
consent
,
 
if
she

do

love
me
well
enough
,
 
I
should
marry
her
.

and
this
be
the
return
you
make
me
for
all
the
indulgence
I
have
heap
on
you
?

<EOS>
say
Wakem
,
get
white
,
and
begin
to
tremble
under
an
enraged
sense
of
impotence
before
Philip
's
calm
defiance
and
concentration
of
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

father
,
"

Philip
,
look
up
at
him
for
the
first
time
;
"
I
do
not
regard
it
as
a
return
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
an
indulgent
father
to
me
;
but
I
have
always
feel
that
it
be
because
you
have
an
affectionate
wish
to
give
me
as
much
happiness
as
my
unfortunate
lot
would
admit
,
not
that
it
be
a
debt
you
expect
me
to
pay
by
sacrifice
all
my
chance
of
happiness
to
satisfy
feeling
of
your
which
I
can
never
share

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
most
son
would
share
their
father
's
feeling
in
this
case
,
"
say
Wakem
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
the
girl
's
father
be
an
ignorant
mad
brute

who
be
within
an
inch
of
murder
me

the
whole
town
know
it
.
<EOS>
and
the
brother
be
just
as
insolent
,
only
in
a
cool
way

<EOS>
He
forbid
her
see
you
,
you
say
;
he
will
break
every
bone
in
your
body
,
for
your
great
happiness
,
if
you
do
not
take
care

you
seem
to
have
make
up
your
mind
;
you
have
count
the
consequence
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
be
independent
of
me
;
you
can
marry
this
girl
to

morrow
,
if
you
like
;
you
be
a
man
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
 
you
can
go
your
way

I
can
go
mine

need
have
no
more
to
do
with
each
other

rise
and
walk
toward
the
door
,

something
hold
him
back
,
and
instead
of
leave
the
room
,
he
walk
up
and
down
it
.
<EOS>
Philip
be
slow
to
reply
,
and
when
he
speak
,
his
tone
have
a
more
incisive
quietness
and
clearness
than
ever

no

"
ah
,

there
_
be
a
reason
for
your
clinging
to
me

doubtless

say
Wakem
,
still
bitterly
,
though
Philip
's
last
word
have
give
him
a
pang
;
they
have
stir
a
feeling
which
have
be
a
habit
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
.

He
throw
himself
into
the
chair
again

<EOS>
"
I
expect
all
this

Philip

<EOS>
"
I
know
these
scene
be
often
happen

I
be
like
other
man

I
may
answer
your
angry
word

still
angrier

part

I
should
marry
the
woman
I
love
,
and
have
a
chance
of
be
as
happy
as
the
rest

<EOS>
but
if
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
to
annihilate
the
very
object
of
everything
you
have
do
for
me
,
you
have
an
advantage
over
most
father

completely
deprive

would

"
You
know
good
what
satisfaction
you

out

me

I
shall
not

when

settling

Philip

who
have
his
reason
for
some
sympathy
with
this
view
of
Tom

a
feeling

revenge
be
not
worth
much

that
you

I
mean
your

dart
a

fierce
question
at

be
not
look
at

with

penitent
consciousness
go
on
,
in

moment

as

in
amplification

find

Wakem
,
rise
again
,
and
forget
everything
else
in
a
burst
of
resentful
pride
,
half
fatherly
,
half
personal
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
deuced
fine
match
for
her

It
be
all
stuff
about
an
accidental
deformity

when
a

really
attach
to

be
not
apt

<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
Wakem
,
rather
brutally
,
try
to
recover
his
previous
position
,
"
if
she
do
not
care
for
you
,
you
may
have
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
talk
to
me
about
her
,
and
you
may
have
spare
me
the
trouble
of
refuse
my
consent
to
what

never
likely
to
happen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wakem
strode
to
the
door
,
and
without
look
round
again
,
bang
it
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
be
not
without
confidence
that
his
father
would
be
ultimately
work
upon
as
he
have
expect
,
by
what
have
pass
;
but
the
scene
have
jar
upon
his
nerve
,
which
be
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
's
.
<EOS>
He
determine
not
to
go
down
to
dinner
;
he
could
not
meet
his
father
again
that
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
Wakem
's
habit
,
when
he
have
no
company
at
home
,
to
go
out
in
the
evening
,
often
as
early
as
half
-
past
seven
;
and
as
it
be
far
on
in
the
afternoon
now
,
Philip
lock
up
his
room
and
go
out
for
a
long
ramble
,
think
he
would
not
return
until
his
father
be
out
of
the
house
again
.
<EOS>
He
get
into
a
boat
,
and
go
down
the
river
to
a
favorite
village
,
where
he
dine
,
and
linger
till
it
be
late
enough
for
him
to
return
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
have
any
sort
of
quarrel
with
his
father
before
,
and
have
a
sickening
fear
that
this
contest
,
just
begin
,
may
go
on
for
week
;
and
what
may
not
happen
in
that
time
?
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
himself
to
define
what
that
involuntary
question
mean
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
could
once
be
in
the
position
of
Maggie
's
accept
,
acknowledge
lover
,
there
would
be
less
room
for
vague
dread
.
<EOS>
He
go
up
to
his
painting
-
room
again
,
and
throw
himself
with
a
sense
of
fatigue
into
the
armchair
,
look
round
absently
at
the
view
of
water
and
rock
that
be
range
around
,
till
he
fall
into
a
doze
,
in
which
he
fancy
Maggie
be
slip
down
a
glistening
,
green
,
slimy
channel
of
a
waterfall
,
and
he
be
look
on
helpless
,
till
he
be
awaken
by
what
seem
a
sudden
,
awful
crash
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
opening

the
door

he
could
hardly
have
doze
more
than
a
few
moment
,
for
there
be
no
perceptible
change
in
the
evening
light
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
father
who
enter
;
and
when
Philip
move
to
vacate
the
chair
for
him
,
he
say
,
    
"
sit
still
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
walk
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stalk
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
,
and
then
,
stand
opposite
Philip
with
his
hand
thrust
in
his
side
pocket
,
he
say
,
as
if
continue
a
conversation
that
have
not
be
break
off
,
    
<EOS>
"
but
this
girl
seem
to
have
be
fond
of
you
,
Phil
,
else
she
would
not
have
meet
you
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
heart
be
beat
rapidly
,
and
a
transient
flush
pass
over
his
face
like
a
gleam
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
quite
easy
to
speak
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
like
me
at
King
's
Lorton
,
when
she
be
a
little
girl
,
because
I
use
to
sit
with
her
brother
a
great
deal
when
he
have
hurt
his
foot
.
<EOS>
She
have
keep
that
in
her
memory
,
and
thought
of
me
as
a
friend
of
a
long
while
ago
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
of
me
as
a
lover
when
she
meet
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
you
make
love
to
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
what
do
she
say
then
?
<EOS>
"
say
Wakem
,
walk
about
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
she
_
<EOS>
do
_
love
me
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
confound
it
,
then
;
what
else
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
be
she
a
jilt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
young
then
,
"
say
Philip
,
hesitatingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
she
hardly
know
what
she
feel
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
our
long
separation
,
and
the
idea
that
event
must
always
divide
us
,
may
have
make
a
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
be
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
her
at
church
.
<EOS>
have
not
you
spoken
to
her
since
you
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
at
Mr.
Deane
's
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
renew
my
proposal
to
her
on
several
ground
.
<EOS>
one
obstacle
would
be
remove
if
you
would
give
your
consent
,
 
if
you
would
be
willing
to
think
of
her
as
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wakem
be
silent
a
little
while
,
pause
before
Maggie
's
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
the
sort
of
woman
<EOS>
your
mother
be
,
though
,
Phil
,
"
he
say
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
her
at
church
,
 
she
be
handsome
than
this
,
 
deuce
fine
eye
and
fine
figure
,
I
see
;
but
rather
dangerous
and
unmanageable
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
tender
and
affectionate
,
and
so
simple
,
 
without
the
air
and
petty
contrivance
other
woman
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
?
"
say
Wakem
.
<EOS>
then
look
round
at
his
son
,
"
<EOS>
but
your
mother
look
gentler
;
she
have
that
brown
wavy
hair
and
gray
eye
,
like
yours
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
remember
her
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
thousand
pity
<EOS>
I
would
no
likeness
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
should
not
you
be
glad
for
me
to
have
the
same
sort
of
happiness
,
father
,
to
sweeten
my
life
for
me
?
<EOS>
there
can
never
be
another
tie
so
strong
to
you
as
that
which
begin
eight
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
,
when
you
marry
my
mother
,
and
you
have
be
tighten
it
ever
since

<EOS>
"
  
"
ah
,
Phil
,
you
be
the
only
fellow
that
know
the
good
of
me
,
"
say
Wakem
,
give
his
hand
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
keep
together
if
we
can
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
what
be
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
You
must
come
downstairs
and
tell
me
.
<EOS>
be
I
to
go
and
call
on
this
dark
-
eyed
damsel
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
barrier
once
throw
down
in
this
way
,
Philip
could
talk
freely
to
his
father
of
their
entire
relation
with
the
Tullivers
,
 
of
the
desire
to
get
the
mill
and
land
back
into
the
family
,
and
of
its
transfer
to
Guest
&
Co.
as
an
intermediate
step
.
<EOS>
He
could
venture
now
to
be
persuasive
and
urgent
,
and
his
father
yield
with
more
readiness
than
he
have
calculate
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
do
not
care
about
the
mill
,
"
he
say
at
last
,
with
a
sort
of
angry
compliance
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
an
infernal
deal
of
bother
lately
about
the
mill
.
<EOS>
let
them
pay
me
for
my
improvement
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
thing
you
need
not
ask
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
direct
transaction
with
young
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
if
you
like
to
swallow
him
for
his
sister
's
sake
,
you
may
;
but
I
have
no
sauce
that
will
make
him
go
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
imagine
the
agreeable
feeling
with
which
Philip
go
to
Mr.
Deane
the
next
day
,
to
say
that
Mr.
Wakem
be
ready
to
open
the
negotiation
,
and
Lucy
's
pretty
triumph
as
she
appeal
to
her
father
whether
she
have
not
prove
her
great
business
ability
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deane
be
rather
puzzle
,
and
suspect
that
there
have
be
something
"
go
on
"
among
the
young
people
to
which
he
want
a
clew
.
<EOS>
but
to
man
of
Mr.
Deane
's
stamp
,
what
go
on
among
the
young
people
be
as
extraneous
to
the
real
business
of
life
as
what
go
on
among
the
bird
and
butterfly
,
until
it
can
be
show
to
have
a
malign
bearing
on
monetary
affair
.
<EOS>
and
in
this
case
the
bearing
appear
to
be
entirely
propitious
.
    
<EOS>
Charity

Dress
  
<EOS>
the
culmination
of
Maggie
's
career
as
an
admired
member
of
society
in
St.
Ogg
's
be
certainly
the
day
of
the
bazaar
,
when
her
simple
noble
beauty
,
clothe
in
a
white
muslin
of
some
soft
-
float
kind
,
which
I
suspect
must
have
come
from
the
store
of
aunt
Pullet
's
wardrobe
,
appear
with
marked
distinction
among
the
more
adorned
and
conventional
woman
around
her
.
<EOS>
We
perhaps
never
detect
how
much
of
our
social
demeanor
be
make
up
of
artificial
air
until
we
see
a
person
who
be
at
once
beautiful
and
simple
;
without
the
beauty
,
we
be
apt
to
call
simplicity
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
the
Miss
Guests
be
much
too
well
-
breed
to
have
any
of
the
grimace
and
affect
tone
that
belong
to
pretentious
vulgarity
;
but
their
stall
be
next
to
the
one
where
Maggie
sit
,
it
seem
newly
obvious
to
-
day
that
Miss
Guest
hold
her
chin
too
high
,
and
that
Miss
Laura
speak
and
move
continually
with
a
view
to
effect
.
  
<EOS>
all
well
-
dress
St.
Ogg
's
and
its
neighborhood
be
there
;
and
it
would
have
be
worth
while
to
come
even
from
a
distance
,
to
see
the
fine
old
hall
,
with
its
open
roof
and
carve
oaken
rafter
,
and
great
oaken
fold
-
door
,
and
light
shed
down
from
a
height
on
the
many

colored
show
beneath
;
a
very
quaint
place
,
with
broad
fade
stripe
paint
on
the
wall
,
and
here
and
there
a
show
of
heraldic
animal
of
a
bristly
,
long
-
snoute
character
,
the
cherish
emblem
of
a
noble
family
once
the
seignior
of
this
now
civic
hall
.
<EOS>
a
grand
arch
,
cut
in
the
upper
wall
at
one
end
,
surmount
an
oaken
orchestra
,
with
an
open
room
behind
it
,
where
hothouse
plant
and
stall
for
refreshment
be
dispose
;
an
agreeable
resort
for
gentleman
dispose
to
loiter
,
and
yet
to
exchange
the
occasional
crush
down
below
for
a
more
commodious
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
perfect
fitness
of
this
ancient
building
for
an
admirable
modern
purpose
,
that
make
charity
truly
elegant
,
and
lead
through
vanity
up
to
the
supply
of
a
deficit
,
be
so
striking
that
hardly
a
person
enter
the
room
without
exchange
the
remark
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
near
the
great
arch
over
the
orchestra
be
the
stone
oriel
with
paint
glass
,
which
be
one
of
the
venerable
inconsistency
of
the
old
hall
;
and
it
be
close
by
this
that
Lucy
have
her
stall
,
for
the
convenience
of
certain
large
plain
article
which
she
have
take
charge
of
for
Mrs.
Kenn
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
beg
to
sit
at
the
open
end
of
the
stall
,
and
to
have
the
sale
of
these
article
rather
than
of
bead
-
mat
and
other
elaborate
product
of
which
she
have
but
a
dim
understanding
.
<EOS>
but
it
soon
appear
that
the
gentleman
's
dressing
-
gown
,
which
be
among
her
commodity
,
be
object
of
such
general
attention
and
inquiry
,
and
excite
<EOS>
so
troublesome
a
curiosity
as
to
their
lining
and
comparative
merit
,
together
with
a
determination
to
test
them
by
try
on
,
as
to
make
her
post
a
very
conspicuous
one
.
<EOS>
the
lady
who
have
commodity
of
their
own
to
sell
,
and
do
not
want
dressing
-
gown
,
see
at
once
the
frivolity
and
bad
taste
of
this
masculine
preference
for
good
which
any
tailor
could
furnish
;
and
it
be
possible
that
the
emphatic
notice
of
various
kind
which
be
draw
toward
Miss
Tulliver
on
this
public
occasion
,
throw
a
very
strong
and
unmistakable
light
on
her
subsequent
conduct
in
many
mind
then
present
.
<EOS>
not
that
anger
,
on
account
of
spurn
beauty
can
dwell
in
the
celestial
breast
of
charitable
lady
,
but
rather
that
the
error
of
person
who
have
once
be
much
admire
necessarily
take
a
deep
tinge
from
the
mere
force
of
contrast
;
and
also
,
that
to
-
day
Maggie
's
conspicuous
position
,
for
the
first
time
,
make
evident
certain
characteristic
which
be
subsequently
feel
to
have
an
explanatory
bearing
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
rather
bold
in
Miss
Tulliver
's
direct
gaze
,
and
something
undefinably
coarse
in
the
style
of
her
beauty
,
which
place
her
,
in
the
opinion
of
all
feminine
judge
,
far
below
her
cousin
Miss
Deane
;
for
the
lady
of
St.
Ogg
's
have
now
completely
cede
to
Lucy
their
hypothetic
claim
on
the
admiration
of
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
dear
little
Lucy
herself
,
her
late
benevolent
triumph
about
the
Mill
,
and
all
the
affectionate
project
she
be
cherish
for
Maggie
and
Philip
,
help
to
give
her
the
high
spirit
to
-
day
,
and
she
feel
nothing
but
pleasure
in
the
evidence
of
Maggie
's
attractiveness
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
she
be
look
very
charming
herself
,
and
Stephen
be
pay
her
the
utmost
attention
on
this
public
occasion
;
jealously
buy
up
the
article
he
have
see
under
her
finger
in
the
process
of
make
,
and
gayly
help
her
to
cajole
the
male
customer
into
the
purchase
of
the
most
effeminate
futility
.
<EOS>
He
choose
to
lay
aside
his
hat
and
wear
a
scarlet
fez
of
her
embroidering
;
but
by
superficial
observer
this
be
necessarily
liable
to
be
interpret
less
as
a
compliment
to
Lucy
than
as
a
mark
of
coxcombry
.
<EOS>
"
Guest
be
a
great
coxcomb
,
"
young
Torry
observe
;
"
but
then
he
be
a
privileged
person
in
St.
Ogg

<EOS>
he
carry
all
before
him

if
another
fellow
do
such
thing

everybody
would

he
make

"
  
<EOS>
and
Stephen
purchase
absolutely
nothing
from
Maggie
,
until
Lucy
say
,
in
rather
a
vexed
undertone
<EOS>
,
    
"
see
,
now
;
all
the
thing
of
Maggie

knitting
will
be
go

you
will
not

there

<EOS>
"

no

Stephen
,

must
be
intend
for
imaginative

can
chill
themselves
on

warm

thinking

frosty
Caucasus

stern
reason

my
forte

you

You
must
get
Philip

he
would

up

now
,
do
go
and
buy
something
of
Maggie

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no

see
,
she
have
get
a
customer
;
there
be
old
Wakem
himself
just
come
up

"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
's
eye
turn
with
anxious
interest
toward
Maggie
to
see
how
she
go
through
this
first
interview
,
since
a
sadly
memorable
time
,
with
a
man
toward
whom
she
must
have
so
strange
a
mixture
of
feeling
;
but
she
be
pleased
to
notice
that
Wakem
have
tact
enough
to
enter
at
once
into
talk
about
the
bazaar
ware
,
and
appear
interested
in
purchasing
,
smile
now
and
then
kindly
at
Maggie
,
and
not
call
on
her
to
speak
much
,
as
if
he
observe
that
she
be
rather
pale
and
tremulous
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Wakem
be
make
himself
particularly
amiable
to
your
cousin
,
"
say
Stephen
,
in
an
undertone
to
Lucy
;
"
be
it
pure
magnanimity
?
<EOS>
You
talk
of
a
family
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
will
soon
be
quite
heal
,
I
hope
,
"
say
Lucy
,
become
a
little
indiscreet
in
her
satisfaction
,
and
speak
with
an
air
of
significance
.
<EOS>
but
Stephen
do
not
appear
to
notice
this
,
and
as
some
lady
-
purchaser
come
up
,
he
lounge
on
toward
Maggie
's
end
,
handle
trifle
and
stand
aloof
until
Wakem
,
who
have
take
out
his
purse
,
have
finish
his
transaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
come
with
me
,
"
he
overhear
Wakem
say
,
"
but
he
have
vanish
into
some
other
part
of
the
building
,
and
have
leave
all
these
charitable
gallantry
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
reproach
him
for
his
shabby
conduct

"
  
<EOS>
She
return
his
smile
and
bow
without
speak
,
and
he
turn
away
,
only
then
observe
Stephen
and
nod
to
him
.
<EOS>
Maggie

conscious
that
Stephen
be
still
there

busy
herself

and
have
not

<EOS>
They
have
begin
the
morning
with
an
indifferent
salutation
,
and
both
have
rejoice
in

aloof

like

and
during

few
day
they
have

be
make
up
their
mind
to
failure
,
look
to
the
outward
event

<EOS>
Maggie
go
on
count
her

till
she
suddenly
hear
a
deep
gentle
voice
say
,
"
be
not
you
very
try

<EOS>
do
let
me
bring
you
something

some

<EOS>
the
unexpected
tone
shake
her

by

faintly

half
look
up
for
an
instant

<EOS>
"
You
look
so
pale

Stephen
insist
,
in
a
more
entreating
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I

sure
you

I

disobey
you

<EOS>
"
no

I
could
not

it

you

"
pray

go
away

say
Maggie
,
look
at
him
helplessly
,
her
eye
glance
immediately
from
him
to
the
opposite
corner
of
the
orchestra
,
which
be
half
hide
by
the
fold
of
the
old
fade
green
curtain
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
no
sooner
utter
this
entreaty
than
she
be
wretched
at
the
admission
it
imply
;
but
Stephen
turn
away
at
once
,
and
follow
her
upward
glance
,
he
see
Philip
Wakem
seal
in
the
half
-
hide
corner
,
so
that
he
could
command
little
more
than
that
angle
of
the
hall
in
which
Maggie
sit
.
<EOS>
an
entirely
new
though
occur
to
Stephen
,
and
link
itself
with
what
he
have
observe
of
Wakem
's
manner
,
and
with
Lucy
's
reply
to
his
observation
,
it
convince
him
that
there
have
be
some
former
relation
between
Philip
and
Maggie
beyond
that
childish
one
of
which
he
have
hear
.
<EOS>
More
than
one
impulse
make
him
immediately
leave
the
hall
and
go
upstairs
to
the
refreshment
-
room
,
where
,
walk
up
to
Philip
,
he
sit
down
behind
him
,
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
study
for

Phil

he

,

It

I

snub

as
usual

<EOS>
there
be
natural
antipathy

I

I

seldom

<EOS>
"
what
a

you
be

"
say
Philip
,
flush
angrily

<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
because
experience
must
have
tell
me
that
I

universally
pleasing

I

there
be
some
disturbing

<EOS>
the
two

walk
downstairs
together
without

<EOS>
Philip
turn
through
the
outer
door
into
the
court

yard
;
but
Stephen
,
say
,
"
oh
,
by
the
by
,
I
must
call
in
here
,
"
go
on
along
the
passage
to
one
of
the
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
,
which
be
appropriate
to
the
town
library

<EOS>
He
have
the
room
all
to
himself
,
and
a
man
require
nothing
less
than
this
when
he
want
to
dash
his
cap
on
the
table
,
throw
himself
astride
a
chair
,
and
stare
at
a
high
brick
wall
with
a
frown
which
would
not
have
be
beneath
the
occasion
if
he
have
be
slay
"
the
giant
Python
.
<EOS>
"
the
conduct
that
issue
from
a
moral
conflict
have
often
so
close
a
resemblance
to
vice
that
the
distinction
escape
all
outward
judgment
found
on
a
mere
comparison
of
action
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
to
you
,
I
hope
,
that
Stephen
be
not
a
hypocrite
,
 
capable
of
deliberate
doubleness
for
a
selfish
end
;
and
yet
his
fluctuation
between
the
indulgence
of
a
feeling
and
the
systematic
concealment
of
it
may
have
make
a
good
case
in
support
of
Philip
's
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Maggie
sit
at
her
stall
cold
and
tremble
,
with
that
painful
sensation
in
the
eye
which
come
from
resolutely
repressed
tear
.
<EOS>
be
her
life
to
be
always
like
this
,
 
always
bring
some
new
source
of
inward
strife
?
<EOS>
She
hear
confusedly
the
busy
,
indifferent
voice
around
her
,
and
wish
her
mind
could
flow
into
that
easy
babble
current
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
this
moment
that
Dr.
Kenn

who
have
quite
lately
come
into
the
hall
,
and
be
now
walk
down
the
middle
with
his
hand
behind
him
,
take
a
general
view
,
fix
his
eye
on
Maggie
for
the
first
time
,
and
be
strike
with
the
expression
of
pain
on
her
beautiful
face
.
<EOS>
She
be
sit
quite
still
,
for
the
stream
of
customer
have
lessen
at
this
late
hour
in
the
afternoon
;
the
gentleman
have
chiefly
choose
the
middle
of
the
day
,
and
Maggie

stall
be
look
rather
bare
.
<EOS>
this
,
with
her
absent
,
pained
expression
,
finish
the
contrast
between
her
and
her
companion
,
who
be
all
bright
,
eager
,
and
busy

<EOS>
He
be
strongly
arrest
.
<EOS>
Her
face
have
naturally
draw
his
attention
as
a
new
and
strike
one
at
church
,
and
he
have
be
introduce
to
her
during
a
short
call
on
business
at
Mr.
Deane
's
,
but
he
have
never
speak
more
than
three
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
walk
toward
her
now
,
and
Maggie
,
perceive
some
one
approach
,
rouse
herself
to
look
up
and
be
prepared
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
feel
a
childlike
,
instinctive
relief
from
the
sense
of
uneasiness
in
this
exertion
,
when
she
see
it
be
Dr.
Kenn
's
face
that
be
look
at
her
;
<EOS>
that
plain
,
middle
-
aged
face

with
a
grave
,
penetrate
kindness
in
it

seem
to
tell

a
human

reach
a
firm

safe
strand

but
be
look
with
helpful
pity
toward
the
struggler

toss
by
the
wave

have
an
effect
on
Maggie
at
this
moment
which
be
afterward
remember
by
her
as
if
it
have
be
a
promise
.
<EOS>
the
middle
-
aged
,
who
have
live
through
their
strong
emotion
,
but
be
yet
in
the
time
when
memory
be
still
half
passionate
and
not
merely
contemplative
,
should
surely
be
a
sort
of
natural
priesthood
,
whom
life
have
discipline
and
consecrate
to
be
the
refuge
and
rescue
of
early
stumbler
and
victim
of
self
-
despair
.
<EOS>
Most
of
us
,
at
some
moment
in
our
young
life
,
would
have
welcome
a
priest
of
that
natural
order
in
any
sort
of
canonical
or
uncanonical
,
but
have
to
scramble
upward
into
all
the
difficulty
of
nineteen
entirely
without
such
aid
,
as
Maggie
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
find
your
office
rather
a
fatiguing
one
,
I
fear
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
"
say
Dr.
Kenn
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
rather
,
"
say
Maggie
,
simply
,
not
be
accustom
to
simpler
amiable
denial
of
obvious
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
tell
Mrs.
Kenn
that
you
have
dispose
of
her
good
very
quickly

he
add
;
"
she
will
be
very
much
oblige
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
have
do
nothing
;
the
gentleman
come
very
fast
to
buy
the
dressing

gown

I
think
any
of
the

would
have
sell
more

about

You

I

very
soon

ah

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
_
I
must
go
_
,
"
say
Maggie
,
earnestly
,
look
at
Dr.
Kenn
with
an
expression
of
reliance
,
as
if
she
have
tell
him
her
history
in
those
three
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
moment
of
implicit
revelation
which
will
sometimes
happen
even
between
people
who
meet
quite
transiently
,
 
on
a
mile
's
journey
,
perhaps
,
or
when
rest
by
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
this
possibility
of
a
word
or
look
from
a
stranger
to
keep
alive
the
sense
of
human
brotherhood
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
's
ear
and
eye
take
in
all
the
sign
that
this
brief
confidence
of
Maggie
's
be
charge
with
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
he
say
;
"
you
feel
it
right
to
go
.
<EOS>
but
that
will
not
prevent
our
meeting
again
,
I
hope
;
it
will
not
prevent
my
knowing
you
better
,
if
I
can
be
of
any
service
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
and
press
her
kindly
before
he
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
some
trouble
or
other
at
heart
,
"
he
think
.
<EOS>
"
poor

<EOS>
she
look

there

<EOS>
It
may
be
surprising
that
Maggie
,
among
whose
many
imperfection
an
excessive
delight
in
admiration
and
acknowledge
supremacy
be
not
absent
now
,
any
more
than
when
she
be
instruct
the
gypsy
with
a
view
toward
achieve
a
royal
position
among

,
be
not
more
elated
on
a
day
when
she
have
have
the
tribute
of
so
many
look
and
smile
,
together
with
that
satisfactory
consciousness
which
have
necessarily
come
from
be
take
before
Lucy

chevalglass
,
and
make
to
look
at
the
full
length
of
her
tall
beauty
,
crown
by
the
night
of
her
massy
hair
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
smile
at
herself
then
,
and
for
the
moment
have
forget
everything
in
the
sense
of
her
own
beauty
.
<EOS>
if
that
state
of
mind
could
have
last
,
her
choice
would
have
be
to
have
Stephen
Guest
at
her
foot
,
offer
her
a
life
fill
with
all
luxury
,
with
daily
incense
of
adoration
near
and
distant
,
and
with
all
possibility
of
culture
at
her
command

<EOS>
but
there
be
thing
in
her
strong
than
vanity
,
 
passion
and
affection
,
and
long
,
deep
memory
of
early
discipline
and
effort
,
of
early
claim
on
her
love
and
pity

and
the
stream
of
vanity
be
soon
sweep
along
and
mingle
imperceptibly
with
that
wide
current
which
be
at
its
high
force
today
,
under
the
double
urgency
of
the
event
and
inward
impulse
bring
by
the
last
week

<EOS>
Philip
have
not
speak
to
her
himself
about
the
removal
of
obstacle
between
them
on
his
father
's
side
,
 
he
shrink
from
that
;
but
he
have
tell
everything
to
Lucy
,
with
the
hope
that
Maggie
,
be
inform
through
her
,
may
give
him
some
encouraging
sign
that
their
be
bring
thus
much
near
to
each
other
<EOS>
be
a
happiness
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
rush
of
conflicting
feeling
be
too
great
for
Maggie
to
say
much
when
Lucy
,
with
a
face
breathe
playful
joy
,
like
one
of
Correggio
's
cherub
,
pour
forth
her
triumphant
revelation
;
and
Lucy
could
hardly
be
surprised
that
she
could
do
little
more
than
cry
with
gladness
at
the
thought
of
her
father
's
wish
be
fulfil
,
and
of
Tom
's
get
the
Mill
again
in
reward
for
all
his
hard
striving
.
<EOS>
the
detail
of
preparation
for
the
bazaar
have
then
come
to
usurp
Lucy
's
attention
for
the
next
few
day
,
and
nothing
have
be
say
by
the
cousin
on
subject
that
be
likely
to
rouse
deep
feeling
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
be
to
the
house
more
than
once
,
but
Maggie
have
have
no
private
conversation
with
him
,
and
thus
she
have
be
leave
to
fight
her
inward
battle
without
interference
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
the
bazaar
be
fairly
end
,
and
the
cousin
be
alone
again
,
rest
together
at
home

Lucy
say
,
    
"
You

"
because
you

time

Firniss

ask
her
to

at
last
,
"

so
unkind
to
me
 
not

"
<EOS>
She
hesitate
a
little
,
and
then
add
,
"
<EOS>
and
Philip

<EOS>
I
think
everything

so
happy

<EOS>

Maggie
,
what

the
reason
?
<EOS>
give

<EOS>
"

Maggie
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
Tom
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
say
I
must
give
him
up
if
I
marry
Philip

<EOS>
and
I
know
he
will
not
change
 
at
least
not
for
a
long
while
 
unless
something
happen
to
soften
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
talk
to
him
;
he
be
come
back
this
week
.
<EOS>
and
this
good
news
about
the
Mill
will
soften
him
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
talk
to
him
about
Philip
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
always
very
compliant
to
me
;
I
do
not
think
he
be
so
obstinate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
must
go
,
"
say
Maggie
,
in
a
distressed
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
leave
some
time
to
pack
.
<EOS>
do
not
press
me
to
stay
,
dear
Lucy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
be
silent
for
two
or
three
minute
,
look
away
and
ruminate
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
kneel
down
by
her
cousin
,
and
look
up
in
her
face
with
anxious
seriousness
,
say
,
    
"
Maggie
,
be
it
that
you
do
not

Philip
well
enough
to

tell
me
 
trust
me

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
hold
Lucy
's
hand
tightly
in
silence
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
Her
own
hand
be
quite
cold
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
speak
,
her
voice
be
quite
clear
and
distinct
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Lucy
,
I
would
choose
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
the
good
and
high
lot
for
me
,
 
to
make
his
life
happy
.
<EOS>
He
love
me
first
.
<EOS>
no
one
else
could
be
quite
what
he
be
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
divide
myself
from
my
brother
for
life
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
away
,
and
wait
.
<EOS>
pray
do
not
speak
to
me
again
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
obey
in
pain
and
wonder
.
<EOS>
the
next
word
she
say
be
,
    
"
well
,
dear
Maggie
,
at
least
you
will
go
to
the
dance
at
Park
House
to
-
morrow
,
and
have
some
music
and
brightness
,
before
you
go
to
pay
these
dull
dutiful
visit
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
here
come
aunty
and
the
tea
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
Spell
seem
break
  
the
suite
of
room
open
into
each
other
at
Park
House
look
duly
brilliant
with
light
and
flower
and
the
personal
splendor
of
sixteen
couple
,
with
attendant
parent
and
guardian
.
<EOS>
the
focus
of
brilliancy
be
the
long
drawing
-
room
,
where
the
dancing
go
forward
,
under
the
inspiration
of
the
grand
piano
;
the
library
,
into
which
it
open
at
one
end
,
have
the
more
sober
illumination
of
maturity
,
with
cap
and
card
;
and
at
the
other
end
the
pretty
sitting
-
room
,
with
a
conservatory
attach
,
be
leave
as
an
occasional
cool
retreat
.
<EOS>
Lucy
,
who
have
lay
aside
her
black
for
the
first
time
,
and
have
her
pretty
slimness
set
off
by
an
abundant
dress
of
white
crape
,
be
the
acknowledge
queen
of
the
occasion
;
for
this
be
one
of
the
Miss
Guests
'
thoroughly
condescend
party
,
include
no
member
of
any
aristocracy
high
than
that
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
stretch
to
the
extreme
limit
of
commercial
and
professional
gentility
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
at
first
refuse
to
dance
,
say
that
she
have
forget
all
the
figure
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
many
year
since
she
have
dance
at
school
;
and
she
be
glad
to
have
that
excuse
,
for
it
be
<EOS>
ill
dance
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
but
at
length
the
music
work
in
her
young
limb
,
and
the
longing
come
;
even
though
it
be
the
horrible
young
Torry
,
who
walk
up
a
second
time
to
try
and
persuade
her
.
<EOS>
She
warn
him
that
she
could
not
dance
anything
but
a
country
-
dance
;
but
he
,
of
course
,
be
willing
to
wait
for
that
high
felicity
,
mean
only
to
be
complimentary
when
he
assure
her
at
several
interval
that
it
be
a
"
great
bore
"
<EOS>
that
she
could
not
waltz
,
he
would
have
like
so
much
to
waltz
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
it
be
the
turn
of
the
good
old
-
fashioned
dance
which
have
the
least
of
vanity
and
the
most
of
merriment
in
it
,
and
Maggie
quite
forget
her
troublous
life
in
a
childlike
enjoyment
of
that
half
-
rustic
rhythm
which
seem
to
banish
pretentious
etiquette
.
<EOS>
She
feel
quite
charitably
toward
young
Torry
,
as
his
hand
bear
her
along
and
hold
her
up
in
the
dance
;
her
eye
and
cheek
have
that
fire
of
young
joy
in
them
which
will
flame
out
if
it
can
find
the
least
breath
to
fan
it
;
and
her
simple
black
dress
,
with
its
bit
of
black
lace
,
seem
like
the
dim
setting
of
a
jewel
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
have
not
yet
ask
her
to
dance
;
have
not
yet
pay
her
more
than
a
pass
civility
.
<EOS>
since
yesterday
,
that
inward
vision
of
her
which
perpetually
make
part
of
his
consciousness
,
have
be
half
screen
by
the
image
of
Philip
Wakem
,
which
come
across
it
like
a
blot
;
there
be
some
attachment
between
her
and
Philip
;
at
least
there
be
an
attachment
on
his
side
,
which
make
her
feel
in
some
bondage
.
<EOS>
here
,
then
,
Stephen
tell
himself
,
be
another
claim
of
honor
which
call
on
him
to
resist
the
attraction
that
be
continually
threaten
to
overpower
him
.
<EOS>
He
tell
himself
so
;
and
yet
he
have
once
or
twice
feel
a
certain
savage
resistance
,
and
at
another
moment
a
shuddering
repugnance
,
to
this
intrusion
of
Philip
's
image
,
which
almost
make
it
a
new
incitement
to
rush
toward
Maggie
and
claim
her
for
himself
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
have
do
what
he
mean
to
do
this
evening
,
 
he
have
keep
aloof
from
her
;
he
have
hardly
look
at
her
;
and
he
have
be
gayly
assiduous
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
but
now
his
eye
be
devour
Maggie
;
he
feel
inclined
to
kick
young
Torry
out
of
the
dance
,
and
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
then
he
want
the
dance
to
end
that
he
may
get
rid
of
his
partner
.
<EOS>
the
possibility
that
he
too
should
dance
with
Maggie
,
and
have
her
hand
in
his
so
long
,
be
begin
to
possess
him
like
a
thirst
.
<EOS>
but
even
now
their
hand
be
meet
in
the
dance
,
 
be
meet
still
to
the
very
end
of
it
,
though
they
be
far
off
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
hardly
know
what
happen
,
or
in
what
automatic
way
he
get
through
the
duty
of
politeness
in
the
interval
,
until
he
be
free
and
see
Maggie
seat
alone
again
,
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
way
toward
her
round
the
couple
that
be
form
for
the
waltz
;
and
when
Maggie
become
conscious
that
she
be
the
person
he
seek
,
she
feel
,
in
spite
of
all
the
thought
that
have
go
before
,
a
glowing
gladness
at
heart
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
and
cheek
be
still
brighten
with
her
childlike
enthusiasm
in
the
dance
;
her
whole
frame
be
set
to
joy
and
tenderness
;
even
the
come
pain
could
not
seem
bitter
,
 
she
be
ready
to
welcome
it
as
a
part
of
life
,
for
life
at
this
moment
seem
a
keen
,
vibrate
consciousness
poise
above
pleasure
or
pain
.
<EOS>
this
one
,
this
last
night
,
she
may
expand
unrestrainedly
in
the
warmth
of
the
present
,
without
those
chill
,
eat
thought
of
the
past
and
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
go
to
waltz
again
,
"
say
Stephen
,
bend
to
speak
to
her
,
with
that
glance
and
tone
of
subdued
tenderness
which
young
dream
create
to
themselves
in
the
summer
wood
when
low
,
cooing
voice
fill
the
air
.
<EOS>
such
glance
and
tone
bring
the
breath
of
poetry
with
them
into
a
room
that
be
half
stifle
with
glare
gas
and
hard
flirtation
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
go
to
waltz
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
rather
dizzy
work
to
look
on
,
and
the
room
be
very
warm
;
shall
we
walk
about
a
little
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
and
place
it
within
his
arm
,
and
they
walk
on
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
where
the
table
be
strew
with
engraving
for
the
accommodation
of
visitor
who
would
not
want
to
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
but
no
visitor
be
here
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
They
pass
on
into
the
conservatory
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
strange
and
unreal
the
tree
and
flower
look
with
the
light
among
them
!
"
<EOS>
say
Maggie
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
They
look
as
if
they
belong
to
an
enchanted
land
,
and
would
never
fade
away
;
I
could
fancy
they
be
all
make
of
jewel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
look
at
the
tier
of
geranium
as
she
speak
,
and
Stephen
make
no
answer
;
but
he
be
look
at
her
;
and
do
not
a
supreme
poet
blend
light
and
sound
into
one
,
call
darkness
mute
,
and
light
eloquent
?
<EOS>
something
strangely
powerful
<EOS>
there
be
in
the
light
of
Stephen
's
long
gaze
,
for
it
make
Maggie
's
face
turn
toward
it
and
look
upward
at
it
,
slowly
,
like
a
flower
at
the
ascend
brightness
.
<EOS>
and
they
walk
unsteadily
on
,
without
feel
that
they
be
walk
;
without
feel
anything
but
that
long
,
grave
,
mutual
gaze
which
have
the
solemnity
belong
to
all
deep
human
passion
.
<EOS>
the
hovering
think
that
they
must
and
would
renounce
each
other
make
this
moment
of
mute
confession
more
intense
in
its
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
have
reach
the
end
of
the
conservatory
,
and
be
oblige
to
pause
and
turn
.
<EOS>
the
change
of
movement
bring
a
new
consciousness
to
Maggie
;
she
blush
deeply
,
turn
away
her
head
,
and
draw
her
arm
from
Stephen
's
,
go
up
to
some
flower
to
smell
them
.
<EOS>
Stephen
stand
motionless
,
and
still
pale
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
may
I
get
this
rose
?
"
say
Maggie
,
make
a
great
effort
to
say
something
,
and
dissipate
the
burning
sense
of
irretrievable
confession
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
be
quite
wicked
with
rose
;
I
like
to
gather
them
and
smell
them
till
they
have
no
scent
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
be
mute
;
he
be
incapable
of
put
a
sentence
together
,
and
Maggie
bend
her
arm
a
little
upward
toward
the
large
half
-
open
rise
that
have
attract
her
.
<EOS>
who
have
not
feel
the
beauty
of
a
woman
's
arm
?
<EOS>
the
unspeakable
suggestion
of
tenderness
that
lie
in
the
dimpled
elbow
,
and
all
the
varied
gently
lessen
curve
,
down
to
the
delicate
wrist
,
with
its
tiny
,
almost
imperceptible
nick
in
the
firm
softness
.
<EOS>
a
woman
's
arm
touch
the
soul
of
a
great
sculptor
two
thousand
year
ago
,
so
that
he
work
an
image
of
it
for
the
Parthenon
which
move
us
still
as
it
clasp
lovingly
the
timeworn
marble
of
a
headless
trunk
.
<EOS>
Maggie
's
be
such
an
arm
as
that
,
and
it
have
the
warm
tint
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
a
mad
impulse
seize
on
Stephen
;
he
dart
toward
the
arm
,
and
shower
kiss
on
it
,
clasp
the
wrist
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
next
moment
Maggie
snatch
it
from
him
,
and
glare
at
him
like
a
wound
war
-
goddess
,
quiver
with
rage
and
humiliation
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
?
"
<EOS>
She
speak
in
a
deeply
shaken
,
half
-
smothered
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
right
have
I
give
you
to
insult
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
dart
from
him
into
the
adjoining
room
,
and
throw
herself
on
the
sofa
,
pant
and
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
a
horrible
punishment
be
come
upon
her
for
the
sin
of
allow
a
moment
's
happiness
that
be
treachery
to
Lucy
,
to
Philip
,
to
her
own
well
soul
.
<EOS>
that
momentary
happiness
have
be
smite
with
a
blight
,
a
leprosy
;
Stephen
think
more
lightly
of
_
her
_
than
he
do
of
Lucy
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Stephen
,
he
lean
back
against
the
framework
of
the
conservatory
,
dizzy
with
the
conflict
of
passion
,
 
love
,
rage
,
and
confused
despair
;
<EOS>
despair
at
his
want
of
self
-
mastery
,
and
despair
that
he
have
offend
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
feeling
surmount
every
other
;
to
be
by
her
side
again
and
entreat
forgiveness
be
the
only
thing
that
have
the
force
of
a
motive
for
him
,
and
she
have
not
be
seat
more
than
a
few
minute
when
he
come
and
stand
humbly
before
her
.
<EOS>
but
Maggie
's
bitter
rage
be
unspent
.
  
<EOS>
"
leave
me
to
myself
,
if
you
please
,
"
she
say
,
with
impetuous
haughtiness
,
"
and
for
the
future
avoid
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
turn
away
,
and
walk
backward
and
forward
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
dire
necessity
of
go
back
into
the
dancing
-
room
again
,
and
he
be
begin
to
be
conscious
of
that
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
absent
so
short
a
time
,
that
when
he

in
again
the
waltz
be
not
end
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
too
,
be
not
long
before
she
re
-
enter
.
<EOS>
all
the
pride
of
her
nature
be
sting
into
activity
;
the
hateful
weakness
which
have
drag
her
within
reach
of
this
wound
to
her
self
-
respect
have
at
least
work
its
own
cure
.
<EOS>
the
thought
and
temptation
of
the
last
month
should
all
be
fling
away
into
an
unvisited
chamber
of
memory
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
allure
her
now
;
duty
would
be
easy
,
and
all
the
old
calm
purpose
would
reign
peacefully
once
more
.
<EOS>
She
re
-
enter
the
drawing
-
room
still
with
some
excited
brightness
in
her
face
,
but
with
a
sense
of
proud
self
-
command
that
defy
anything
to
agitate
her
.
<EOS>
She
refuse
to
dance
again
,
but
she
talk
quite
readily
and
calmly
with
every
one
who
address
her
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
get
home
that
night
,
she
kiss
Lucy
with
a
free
heart
,
almost
exult
in
this
scorch
moment
,
which
have
deliver
her
from
the
possibility
of
another
word
or
look
that
would
have
the
stamp
of
treachery
toward
that
gentle
,
unsuspicious
sister
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
Maggie
do
not
set
off
to
Basset
quite
so
soon
as
she
have
expect
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
to
accompany
her
in
the
carriage
,
and
household
business
could
not
be
dispatch
hastily
by
Mrs.
Tulliver
.
<EOS>
so
Maggie
,
who
have
be
in
a
hurry
to
prepare
herself
,
have
to
sit
wait
,
equip
for
the
drive
,
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Lucy
be
busy
in
the
house
wrap
up
some
bazaar
present
for
the
young
one
at
Basset
,
and
when
there
be
a
loud
ring
at
the
door
-
bell
,
Maggie
feel
some
alarm
l
Lucy
should
bring
out
Stephen
to
her
;
it
be
sure
to
be
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
but
presently
the
visitor
come
out
into
the
garden
alone
,
and
seat
himself
by
her
on
the
garden
-
chair
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
just
catch
the
tip
of
the
Scotch
fir
,
Maggie
,
from
this
seat
,
"
say
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
take
each
other
's
hand
in
silence
,
but
Maggie
have
look
at
him
with
a
more
complete
revival
of
the
old
childlike
<EOS>
affectionate
smile
than
he
have
see
before
,
and
<EOS>
he
feel
encouraged
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
often
look
at
them
,
and
wish
I
could
see
the
low
sunlight
on
the
stem
again
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
never
be
that
way
<EOS>
but
once
,
 
to
the
churchyard
with
my

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
there
,
I

there

continually

"
say
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
but
the
past
to
live
upon
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
keen
remembrance
and
keen
pity
impel
Maggie
to
put
her
hand
in
Philip
's
.
<EOS>
They
have
so
often
walk
hand
in
hand
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
all
the
spot
,
"
she
say
,
 
"
just
where
you
tell
me
of
particular
thing
,
beautiful
story
that
I
have
never
hear
of
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
there
again
soon
,
will
not
you
,
Maggie
?
"
say
Philip
,
get
timid
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Mill
will
soon
be
your
brother
's
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
I
shall
not
be
there
,
"
say
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
only
hear
of
that
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
away
again
;
Lucy
have
not
tell
you
,
perhaps
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
the
future
will
never
join
on
to
the
past
again
,
Maggie
?
<EOS>
that
book
be
quite
closed
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
gray
eye
that
have
so
often
look
up
at
her
with
entreat
worship
,
look
up
at
her
now
,
with
a
last
struggle
ray
of
hope
in
them
,
and
Maggie
meet
them
with
her
large
sincere
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
book
never
will
be
close
,
Philip
,
"
she
say
,
with
grave
sadness
;
"
I
desire
no
future
that
will
break
the
tie
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
but
the
tie
to
my
brother
be
one
of
the
strong
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
nothing
willingly
that
will
divide
me
always
from
him

<EOS>

be
that
the
only
reason
that
would
keep
us
apart
forever

Maggie

Philip
,
with
a
desperate
determination
to
have
a
definite
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
only
reason
,
"
say
Maggie
,
with
calm
decision
.
<EOS>
and
she
believe
it
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
she
feel
as
if
the
enchant
cup
have
be
dash
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
the
reactionary
excitement
that
give
her
a
proud
self

mastery
have
not
subside
,
and
she
look
at
the
future
with
a
sense
of
calm
choice
.
  
<EOS>
They
sit
hand
in
hand
without
look
at
each

or
speak
for
a
few
minute
;
in
Maggie
's
mind
the
first
scene
of
love
and
parting
be
more
present
than
the
actual
moment
,
and
she
be

at
Philip
in
the
Red
Deeps
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
feel
that
he
ought
to
have
be
thoroughly
happy
in
that
answer
of
hers
;
she
be
as
open
and
transparent
as

<EOS>
why
be
he
not
thoroughly
happy
?
<EOS>
jealousy
be
never
satisfied
with
anything
short
of
an
omniscience
that

detect
the
subtle
fold

the
heart

She

at
that
quiet
moment
in
the
life
of
the
farmyard
before

<EOS>
the
great
building
round
the

and
the

a
look
of
sleepy

beating
at

horrible

the
sudden
leaping

the
evidence

"
It

May
I

the
liberty

yard
with

<EOS>
He
have
a
half

jade
,
half
-
irritated
look

such
as
a
man
get
when
he
have
be
dog
by
some
care
or
annoyance
that
make
his
bed
and
his
dinner
of
little
use

<EOS>
He
speak
almost
abruptly

as
if
his
errand
be
too
press
for
him
to
trouble
himself
about
what
would
be
think
by
Mrs.
Moss
of
his
visit
and
request
.
<EOS>
good
Mrs.
Moss
,
rather
nervous
in
the
presence
of
this
apparently
haughty
gentleman
,
be
inwardly
wonder
whether
she
would
be
do
right
or
wrong
to
invite
him
again
to
leave
his
horse
and
walk
in
,
when

feel
all
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
,
and
unable

anything

put
on
her
bonnet

toward
the

out

who
have

straight
before
her
all
the
while
,
turn
again
to
walk
back
,
say
,
with
haughty
resentment
,
    
"
there
be
no
need
for
me
to
go
any
farther

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
you
consider
it
gentlemanly
and
delicate
conduct
to
place
me
in
a
position
that
force
me
to
come
out
with
you

whether
you
wish
to
insult
me
still
further
by
thrust
an
interview
upon
me
in
this
way

"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
be
angry
with
me
for
come

Stephen

bitterly

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
of
no
consequence
what
a

have
to
suffer

it

only
your

dignity
that
you
care
about

Maggie
give
a
slight
start

such
as
may
have
come
from
the
slight
possible
electric
shock

<EOS>
"
as
if
it
be
not
enough
that
I
be
entangle
in
this
way

that
I
be
mad
with
love
for
you
;
that
I
resist
the
strong
passion
a
man
can
feel
,
because
I
try
to
be
true
to
other
claim
;
but
you
must
treat
me
as
if
I
be
a
coarse
brute
,
who
would
willingly
offend
you

<EOS>
and
when
,
if
I
have
my

choice

I
should
ask
you
to
take
my
hand

my
fortune

my

do
what
you

I

I

an
unwarrantable

I

I

immediately

I

You
ought
not

think
it
unpardonable
;
a
man
who
love
with
his
whole
soul
,
as
I
do
you
,
be
liable
to
be
master
by
his
feeling
for
a
moment
;
but
you
know
 
you
must
believe
 
that
the
bad
pain
I
could
have
be
to
have
pain
you
;
that
I
would
give
the
world
to
recall
the
error

Maggie

the
strength
that
have
come
from
resentment

all

her
lip

quiver
visibly

She
could
not

herself

utter
the
full
forgiveness

confession

They

consideration

vile
injustice

bear
everything
more
quietly

gently

I

away

<EOS>
Stephen
be
silent

he
could
not

that
argument

the
opposite

have
work

strongly

It

unnatural

Maggie

you

you
do

"
  
<EOS>
He
be
look
eagerly
at
her
face
for
the
least
sign
of
compliance
;
his
large
,
firm

gentle
grasp
be
on
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
be
silent
for
a
few
moment
,
with
her
eye
fix
on
the
ground
;
then
she
draw
a
deep
breath
,
and
say
,
look
up
at
him
with
solemn
sadness
,
    
"
oh
,
it
be
difficult
,
 
<EOS>
life
be
very
difficult
!
<EOS>
It
seem
right
to
me
sometimes
that
we
should
follow
our
strong
feeling
;
but
then
,
such
feeling
continually
come
across
the
tie
that
all
our
former
life
have
make
for
us
,
 
the
tie
that
have
make
other
dependent
on
us
,

would
cut
them
in
two

<EOS>
if
life
be
quite
easy

simple
,
as
it
may
have
be
in
Paradise
,

we
could
always
see
that
one
be
first
toward
whom
 
I
mean
,
if
life
do
not
make
duty
for
us
before
love
come
,
love
would
be
a
sign
that
two
people
ought
to
belong
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
but
I
see
 
I
feel
it
be
not
so
now
;
there
be
thing
we
must
renounce
in
life
;
some
of
us
must
resign
love
.
<EOS>
many
thing
be
difficult
and
dark
to
me
;
but
I
see
one
thing
quite
clearly
,
 
that
I
must
not
,
can
not
,
seek
my
own
happiness
by
sacrifice
other
.
<EOS>
love
be
natural
;
but
surely
pity
and
faithfulness
and
memory
be
natural
too
.
<EOS>
and
they
would
live
in
me
still
,
and
punish
me
if
I
do
not
obey
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
haunt
by
the
suffering
I
have
cause
.
<EOS>
Our
love
would
be
poison

<EOS>
do
not

me

me

help
me

Maggie
have
become
more
and
more

full

full
of
appealing

the

in

very

party

a
change

which
be
likely
finally
to
carry
away
the
shadow

their

cause
their
hitherto
obscure
virtue
to
shine
forth
in
full

It

be
not
the

enjoy
a

with
a
similar
cordiality
of
recognition
,
which
in
its
fine
freedom

the
coercion

suggest
the
hopeful
possibility
that
we
may
some
day
without

find
ourselves
in
full

with
cockatrice
who
have

It

misfortune

be
conspire

not
obstinately
bent

the
contrary

as
happy

they
deserve

be
after
all
their

<EOS>
to
think
that
the
very

the

very

after
Tom

come
back
from
Newcastle

that
unfortunate
young
Jetsome

whom
Mr.

have
place
at

have
be
pitch
off
his
horse

dangerous
state

Wakem
have
signify
his

should
enter
on
the
premise
at

<EOS>
It
be
very
dreadful

it
do
seem

reward

papa

<EOS>
Aunt
Tulliver
must
certainly
go
to
the
Mill
now
,
and
keep
house
for
Tom
;
that
be
rather
a
loss
to
Lucy
in
the
matter
of
household
comfort
;

then
,
to
think
of
poor
aunty
be
in
her
old
place
again
,
and
gradually
get
comfort
about
her
there
!
  
<EOS>
on
this
last
point
Lucy
have
her
cunning
project
,
and
when
she
and
Maggie
have
make
their
dangerous
way
down
the
bright
stair
into
the
handsome
parlor
,
where
the
very
sunbeam

clean

she
direct
her
manœuvre

rapid

flexible

Her
nature
supply
her
with
no

she
be
puzzle
as

the
unpleasant
change

the
history

be
to
turn
Tom

honor

nothing

for

always
have
that
pleasant
smile

look
at

to
turn
completely
round

he

for

be
delighted
that
all
the
old
grievance
should
be
heal
,
and
that
Maggie
should
have
Philip
with

suitable
despatch
;
in
cousin
Lucy

opinion
nothing
could
be
easy

<EOS>
but
to
mind
strongly
mark
by
the
positive

negative
quality
that
create
severity
,
 
strength
of
will
,
conscious
rectitude
of
purpose
,
narrowness
of
imagination
and
intellect
,
great
power
of
self
-
control
,
and
a
disposition
to
exert
control
over
other
,
 
prejudice
come
as
the
natural
food
of
tendency
which
can
get
no
sustenance
out
of
that
complex
,
fragmentary
,
doubt
-
provoke
knowledge
which
we
call
truth

by

<EOS>
however
it
may
come
,
these
mind
will
give
it
a
habitation
;
it
be
something
to
assert
strongly
and
bravely
,
something
to
fill
up
the
void
of
spontaneous
idea
,
something
to
impose
on
other
with
the
authority

conscious
right

it

at

a
staff

a
baton

<EOS>
every
prejudice
that
will
answer
these
purpose
be
self

evident

<EOS>
Our
good
,
upright
Tom
Tulliver
's
mind
be
of
this
class
;
his
inward
criticism
of
his
father
's
fault
do
not
prevent
him
from
adopt
his
father
's
prejudice
;
it
be
a
prejudice
against
a
man
of
lax
principle
and
lax
life
,
and
it
be
a
meeting
-
point
for
all
the
disappointed
feeling
of
family
and
personal
pride
.
<EOS>
other
feeling
add
their
force
to
produce
Tom
's
bitter
repugnance
to
Philip
,
and
to
Maggie
's
union
with
him
;
and
notwithstanding
Lucy
's
power
over
her
strong
-
willed
cousin
,
she
get
nothing
but
a
cold
refusal
ever
to
sanction
such
a
marriage
;
"
but
of
course
Maggie
could
do
as
she
like
,
 
she
have
declare
her
determination
to
be
independent
.
<EOS>
for
Tom
's
part
,
he
hold
himself
bind
by
his
duty
to
his
father
's
memory
,
and
by
every
manly
feeling
,
never
to
consent
to
any
relation
with
the
Wakems
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
,
all
that
Lucy
have
effect
by
her
zealous
mediation
be
to
fill
Tom
's
mind
with
the
expectation
that
Maggie
's
perverse
resolve
to
go
into
a
situation
again
would
presently
metamorphose
itself
,
as
her
resolve
be
apt
to
do
,
into
something
equally
perverse
,
but
entirely
different
,
 
a
marriage
with
Philip
Wakem
.

Borne

be
again

outwardly
in
much
the
same
position
as
when
her
visit
there
have
just
begin

<EOS>
It
be
easy
for
her
to
fill
her
morning
apart
from
Lucy
without
any
obvious
effort
;
for
she
have
her
promise
visit
to
pay
to
her
aunt
Glegg
,
and
it
be
natural
that
she
should
give
her
mother
more
than
usual
of
her
companionship
in
these
last
week

especially
as
there
be
preparation
to
be

housekeeping

of
no
pretext
for
her
remain
away
in
the
evening
;
she
must
always
come
from
aunt
Glegg
's
before
dinner
,
 
"
else
what
shall
I
have
of
you
?
"
say
Lucy
,
with
a
tearful
pout
that
could
not
be
resist
.
  
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
have
unaccountably
take
to
dining
at
Mr.
Deane
be
as
often
as
possible
,
instead
of
avoid
that
,
as
he
use
to
do
.
<EOS>
at
first
he
begin
his
morning
with
a
resolution
that
he
would
not
dine
there
,
not
even
go
in
the
evening
,
till
Maggie
be
away
.
<EOS>
He
have
even
devise
a
plan
of
start
off
on
a
journey
in
this
agreeable
June
weather
;
the
headache
which
he
have
constantly
be
allege
as
a
ground
for
stupidity
and
silence
be
a
sufficient
ostensible
motive
.
<EOS>
but
the
journey
be
not
take
,
and
by
the
fourth
morning
no
distinct
resolution
be
form
about
the
evening
;
they
be
only
foresee
as
time
when
Maggie
would
still
be
present
for
a
little
while
,
 
when
one
more
touch
,
one
more
glance
,
may
be
snatch
.
<EOS>
for
why
not
?
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
conceal
between
them
<EOS>
;
they
know
,
they
have
confess
their
love
,
and
they
have
renounce
each
other
;
they
be
go
to
part
.
<EOS>
honor
and
conscience
be
go
to
divide
them
;
Maggie
,
with
that
appeal
from
her
inmost
soul
,
have
decide
it
;
but
surely
they
may
cast
a
linger
look
at
each
other
across
the
gulf
,
before
they
turn
away
never
to
look
again
till
that
strange
light
have
forever
fade
out
of
their
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
all
this
time
,
move
about
with
a
quiescence
and
even
torpor
of
manner
,
so
contrast
with
her
usual
fitful
brightness
and
ardor
,
that
Lucy
would
have
have
to
seek
some
other
cause
for
such
a
change
,
if
she
have
not
be
convince
that
the
position
in
which
Maggie
stand
between
Philip
and
her
brother
,
and
the
prospect
of
her
self
-
impose
wearisome
banishment
,
be
quite
enough
to
account
for
a
large
amount
of
depression
.
<EOS>
but
under
this
torpor
there
be
a
fierce
battle
of
emotion
,
such
as
Maggie
in
all
her
life
of
struggle
have
never
know
or
forebode
;
it
seem
to
her
as
if
all
the
bad
evil
in
her
have
lain
in
ambush
till
now
,
and
have
suddenly
start
up
full
-
armed
,
with
hideous
,
overpower
strength
!
<EOS>
there
be
moment
in
which
a
cruel
selfishness
seem
to
be
get
possession
of
her
;
why
should
not
Lucy
,
why
should
not
Philip
,
suffer
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
have
have
to
suffer
through
many
year
of
her
life
;
and
who
have
renounce
anything
for
her
?
<EOS>
and
when
something
like
that
fulness
of
existence
 
love
,
wealth
,
ease
,
refinement
,
all
that
her
nature
crave
 
be
bring
within
her
reach
,
why
be
she
to
forego
it
,
that
another
may
have
it
,
 
another
,
who
perhaps
need
it
less
?
<EOS>
but
amidst
all
this
new
passionate
tumult
there
be
the
old
voice
make
themselves
hear
with
rise
power
,
till
,
from
time
to
time
,
the
tumult
seem
quell
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
be
_
<EOS>
that
existence
which
tempt
her
the
full
existence
she
dream
?
<EOS>
where
,
then
,
would
be
all
the
memory
of
early
striving
;
all
the
deep
pity
for
another
's
pain
,
which
have
be
nurture
in
her
through
year
of
affection
and
hardship
;
all
the
divine
presentiment
of
something
high
than
mere
personal
enjoyment
,
which
have
make
the
sacredness
of
life
?
<EOS>
She
may
as
well
hope
to
enjoy
walk
by
maim
her
foot
,
as
hope
to
enjoy
an
existence
in
which
she
set
out
by
maim
the
faith
and
sympathy
that
be
the
good
organ
of
her
soul
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
pain
be
so
hard
to
_
her
_
<EOS>
,
what
be
it
to
other
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
God
!
<EOS>
preserve
me
from
inflict
 
give
me
strength
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
how
have
she
sink
into
this
struggle
with
a
temptation
that
she
would
once
have
think
herself
as
secure
from
as
from
deliberate
crime
?
<EOS>
when
be
that
first
hateful
moment
in
which
she
have
be
conscious
of
a
feeling
that
clash
with
her
truth
,
affection
,
and
gratitude
,
and
have
not
shake
it
from
her
with
horror
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
loathsome
thing
?
<EOS>
and
yet
,
since
this
strange
,
sweet
,
subdue
influence
do
not
,
should
not
,
conquer
her
,
 
since
it
be
to
remain
simply
her
own
suffering
,
 
her
mind
be
meet
Stephen
be
in
that
thought
of
his
,
that
they
may
still
snatch
moment
of
mute
confession
before
the
parting
come
.
<EOS>
for
be
not
he
suffer
too
?
<EOS>
She
see
it
daily
 
<EOS>
see
it
in
the
sickened
look
of
fatigue
with
which
,
as
soon
as
he
be
not
compel
to
exert
himself
,
he
relapse
into
indifference
toward
everything
<EOS>
but
the
possibility
of
watch
her
.
<EOS>
Could
she
refuse
sometimes
to
answer
that
beseech
look
which
she
feel
to
be
follow
her
like
a
low
murmur
of
love
and
pain
?
<EOS>
She
refuse
it
less
and
less
,
till
at
last
the
evening
for
them
both
be
sometimes
make
of
a
moment
's
mutual
gaze
;
they
think
of
it
till
it
come
,
and
when
it
have
come
,
they
think
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
one
other
thing
Stephen
seem
now
and
then
to
care
for
,
and
that
be
to
sing
<EOS>
;
it
be
a
way
of
speak
to
Maggie
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
not
distinctly
conscious
that
he
be
impel
to
it
by
a
secret
longing
 
run
counter
to
all
his
self
-
confess
resolve
 
to
deepen
the
hold
he
have
on
her
.
<EOS>
watch
your
own
speech
,
and
notice
how
it
be
guide
by
your
less
conscious
purpose
,
and
you
will
understand
that
contradiction
in
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
Wakem
be
a
less
frequent
visitor
,
but
he
come
occasionally
in
the
evening
,
and
it
happen
that
he
be
there
when
Lucy
say
,
as
they
sit
out
on
the
lawn
,
near
sunset
<EOS>
,
    
"
now
Maggie
's
tale
of
visit
to
aunt
Glegg
be
complete
,
I
mean
that
we
shall
go
out
boat
every
day
until
she
go
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
have
half
enough
boating
because
of
these
tiresome
visit
,
and
she
like
it
better
than
anything
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
,
Maggie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
than
any
sort
of
locomotion

I
hope
you
mean
,
"
say
Philip
,
smile
at
Maggie
,
who
be
loll
backward
in
a
low
garden
-
chair
;
"
else
she
will
be
sell
her
soul
to
that
ghostly
boatman
who
haunt
the
Floss

only
for
the
sake
of
be
drift
in
a
boat
forever

"
  
"
Should
you
like
to
be
her
boatman
?
"
say
Lucy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
because
,
if
you
would
,
you
can
come
with
us
and
take
an
oar
.
<EOS>
if
the
Floss
be
but
a
quiet
lake
instead
of
a
river
,
we
should
be
independent
of
any
gentleman
,
for
Maggie
can
row
splendidly
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
we
be
reduce
to
ask
service
of
knight
and
squire
,
who
do
not
seem
to
offer
them
with
great
alacrity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
playful
reproach
at
Stephen
,
who
be
saunter
up
and
down
,
and
be
just
singe
in
pianissimo
falsetto
,
      
"
<EOS>
the
thirst
that
from
the
soul
doth
rise
  
Doth
ask
a
drink
divine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
no
notice
,
but
still
keep
aloof
;
he
have
do
so
frequently
during
Philip
's
recent
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
seem
inclined
for
boating
,
"
say
Lucy
,
when
he
come
to
sit
down
by
her
on
the
bench
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
row
suit
you
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
hate
a
large
party
in
a
boat
,
"
he
say
,
almost
irritably
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
when
you
have
no
one
else
.
"
  
Lucy
color
,
fear
that
Philip
would
be
hurt
;
it
be
quite
a
new
thing
for
Stephen
to
speak
in
that
way
;
but
he
have
certainly
not
be
well
of
late
.
<EOS>
Philip
color
too
,
but
less
from
a
feeling
of
personal
offence
than
from
a
vague
suspicion
that
Stephen
's
moodiness
have
some
relation
to
Maggie
,
who
have
start
up
from
her
chair
as
he
speak
,
and
have
walk
toward
the
hedge
of
laurel
to
look
at
the
descending
sunlight
on
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
Miss
Deane
do
not
know
she
be
exclude
other
by
invite
me
,
"
say
Philip
,
"
I
be
bind
to
resign
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
you
shall
not
,
"
say
Lucy
,
much
vexed
.
<EOS>
"
I
particularly
wish
for
your
company
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
the
tide
will
suit
at
half
-
past
ten
;
it
will
be
a
delicious
time
for
a
couple
of
hour
to
row
to
Luckreth
and
walk
back
,
before
the
sun
get
too
hot
.
<EOS>
and
how
can
you
object
to
four
people
in
a
boat
?
<EOS>
"
she
add
,
look
at
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
object
to
the
people
,
but
the
number
,
"
say
Stephen
,
who
have
recover
himself
,
and
be
rather
ashamed
of
his
rudeness
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
vote
for
a
fourth
at
all
,
of
course
it
would
be
you
,
Phil
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
not
divide
the
pleasure
of
escort
the
lady
;
we
will
take
it
alternately
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
incident
have
the
effect
of
draw
Philip
's
attention
with
freshen
solicitude
toward
Stephen
and
Maggie
;
but
when
they
re
-
enter
the
house
,
music
be
propose
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
and
Mr.
Deane
be
occupy
with
cribbage
,
Maggie
sit
apart
near
the
table
where
the
book
and
work
be
place
,
do
nothing
,
however
,
but
listen
abstractedly
to
the
music
.
<EOS>
Stephen
presently
turn
to
a
duet
which
he
insist
that
Lucy
and
Philip
should
sing
;
he
have
often
do
the
same
thing
before
;
but
this
evening
Philip
think
he
divine
some
double
intention
in
every
word
and
look
of
Stephen
's
,
and
watch
him
keenly
,
angry
with
himself
all
the
while
for
this
cling
suspicion
.
<EOS>
for
have
not
Maggie
virtually
deny
any
ground
for
his
doubt
on
her
side
?
<EOS>
and
she
be
truth
itself
;
it
be
impossible
not
to
believe
her
word
and
glance
when
they
have
last
speak
together
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Stephen
may
be
strongly
fascinated
by
her
<EOS>
(
what
be
more
natural
?
)
,
but
Philip
feel
himself
rather
base
for
intrude
on
what
must
be
his
friend
's
painful
secret
.
<EOS>
still
he
watch
.
<EOS>
Stephen
,
move
away
from
the
piano
,
saunter
slowly
toward
the
table
near
which
Maggie
sit
,
and
turn
over
the
newspaper
,
apparently
in
mere
idleness
.
<EOS>
then
he
seat
himself
with
his
back
to
the
piano
,
drag
a
newspaper
under
his
elbow
,
and
thrust
his
hand
through
his
hair
,
as
if
he
have
be
attract
by
some
bit
of
local
news
in
the
"
Laceham
Courier
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
in
reality
look
at
Maggie
who
have
not
take
the
slight
notice
of
his
approach
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
additional
strength
of
resistance
when
Philip
be
present
,
just
as
we
can
restrain
our
speech
better
in
a
spot
that
we
feel
to
be
hallowed
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
she
hear
the
word
"
dear
"
utter
in
the
soft
tone
of
pained
entreaty
,
like
that
of
a
patient
who
ask
for
something
that
ought
to
have
be
give
without
ask
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
hear
that
word
since
the
moment
in
the
lane
at
Basset
,
when
it
have
come
from
Stephen
again
and
again
,
almost
as
involuntarily
as
if
it
have
be
an
inarticulate
cry
.
<EOS>
Philip
could
hear
no
word
,
but
he
have
move
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
piano
,
and
could
see
Maggie
start
and
blush
,
raise
her
eye
an
instant
toward
Stephen
's
face
,
but
immediately
look
apprehensively
toward
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
evident
to
her
that
Philip
have
observe
her
;
but
a
pang
of
shame
,
under
the
sense
of
this
concealment
,
make
her
move
from
her
chair
and
walk
to
her
mother
's
side
to
watch
the
game
at
cribbage
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
go
home
soon
after
in
a
state
of
hideous
doubt
mingle
with
wretched
certainty
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
him
now
to
resist
the
conviction
that
there
be
some
mutual
consciousness
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
;
and
for
half
the
night
his
irritable
,
susceptible
nerve
be
press
upon
almost
to
frenzy
by
that
one
wretched
fact
;
he
could
attempt
no
explanation
that
would
reconcile
it
with
her
word
and
action
.
<EOS>
when
,
at
last
,
the
need
for
belief
in
Maggie
rise
to
its
habitual
predominance
,
he
be
not
long
in
imagine
the
truth
,
 
she
be
struggle
,
she
be
banish
herself
;
this
be
the
clue
to
all
he
have
see
since
his
return
.
<EOS>
but
athwart
that
belief
there
come
other
possibility
that
would
not
be
drive
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
His
imagination
work
out
the
whole
story
;
Stephen
be
madly
in
love
with
her
;
he
must
have
tell
her
so
;
she
have
reject
him
,
and
be
hurry
away
.
<EOS>
but
would
he
give
her
up
,
know
 
Philip
feel
the
fact
with
heart
-
crush
despair
 
<EOS>
that
she
be
make
half
helpless
by
her
feeling
toward
him
?
  
<EOS>
when
the
morning
come
,
Philip
be
too
ill
to
think
of
keep
his
engagement
to
go
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
in
his
present
agitation
he
could
decide
on
nothing
;
he
could
only
alternate
between
contradictory
intention
.
<EOS>
first
,
he
think
he
must
have
an
interview
with
Maggie
,
and
entreat
her
to
confide
in
him
;
then
,
again
,
he
distrust
his
own
interference
.
<EOS>
had
he
not
be
thrust
himself
on
Maggie
all
along
?
<EOS>
She
have
uttered
word
long
ago
in
her
young
ignorance
;
it
be
enough
to
make
her
hate
him
that
these
should
be
continually
present
with
her
as
a
bond
.
<EOS>
and
have
he
any
right
to
ask
her
for
a
revelation
of
feeling
which
she
have
evidently
intend
to
withhold
from
him
?
<EOS>
He
would
not
trust
himself
to
see
her
,
till
he
have
assure
himself
that
he
could
act
from
pure
anxiety
for
her
,
and
not
from
egoistic
irritation
.
<EOS>
He
write
a
brief
note
to
Stephen
,
and
send
it
early
by
the
servant
,
say
that
he
be
not
well
enough
to
fulfil
his
engagement
to
Miss
Deane
.
<EOS>
Would
Stephen
take
his
excuse
,
and
fill
his
place
?
  
<EOS>
Lucy
have
arrange
a
charming
plan
,
which
have
make
her
quite
content
with
Stephen
's
refusal
to
go
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
She
discover
that
her
father
be
to
drive
to
Lindum
this
morning
at
ten
;
Lindum
be
the
very
place
she
want
to
go
to
,
to
make
purchase
,
 
important
purchase
,
which
must
by
no
means
be
put
off
to
another
opportunity
;
and
aunt
Tulliver
must
go
too
,
because
she
be
concern
in
some
of
the
purchase
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
your
row
in
the
boat
just
the
same
,
you
know
,
"
she
say
to
Maggie
when
they
go
out
of
the
breakfast
-
room
and
upstairs
together
;
<EOS>
"
Philip
will
be
here
it
half
-
past
ten
,
and
it
be
a
delicious
morning
.
<EOS>
now
do
not
say
a
word
against
it
,
you
dear
dolorous
thing
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
my
be
a
fairy
godmother
,
if
you
set
your
face
against
all
the
wonder
I
work
for
you
?
<EOS>
do
not
think
of
awful
cousin
Tom
;
you
may
disobey
him
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
do
not
persist
in
objecting
.
<EOS>
She
be
almost
glad
of
the
plan
,
for
perhaps
it
would
bring
her
some
strength
and
calmness
to
be
alone
with
Philip
again
;
it
be
like
revisit
the
scene
of
a
quieter
life
,
in
which
the
very
struggle
be
repose
,
compare
with
the
daily
tumult
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
She
prepare
herself
for
the
boat
and
at
half
-
past
ten
sit
wait
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
ring
of
the
door
-
bell
be
punctual
,
and
she
be
think
with
half
-
sad
,
affectionate
pleasure
of
the
surprise
Philip
would
have
in
find
that
he
be
to
be
with
her
alone
,
when
she
distinguish
a
firm
,
rapid
step
across
the
hall
,
that
be
certainly
not
Philip
's
;
the
door
open
,
and
Stephen
Guest
enter
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
moment
they
be
both
too
much
agitate
to
speak
;
for
Stephen
have
learn
from
the
servant
that
the
other
be
go
out
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
start
up
and
sit
down
again
,
with
her
heart
beat
violently
;
and
Stephen
,
throw
down
his
cap
and
glove
,
come
and
sit
by
her
in
silence
.
<EOS>
She
think
Philip
would
be
come
soon
;
and
with
great
effort
 
for
she
tremble
visibly
 
<EOS>
she
rise
to
go
to
a
distant
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
come
,
"
say
Stephen
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
we
can
not
go
,
"
say
Maggie
,
sink
into
her
chair
again
.
<EOS>
"
Lucy
do
not
expect
 
she
would
be
hurt
.
<EOS>
why
be
not
Philip
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
well
;
he
ask
me
to
come
instead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lucy
be
go
to
Lindum
,
"
say
Maggie
,
take
off
her
bonnet
with
hurried
,
tremble
finger
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
well
,
"
say
Stephen
,
dreamily
,
look
at
her
,
as
he
rest
his
arm
on
the
back
of
his
chair
.
<EOS>
"
then
we
will
stay
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
look
into
her
deep
,
deep
eye
,
far
off
and
mysterious
at
the
starlit
blackness
,
and
yet
very
near
,
and
timidly
loving
.
<EOS>
Maggie
sit
perfectly
still
 
perhaps
for
moment
,
perhaps
for
minute
 
until
the
helpless
tremble
have
cease
,
and
there
be
a
warm
glow
on
her
check
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
man
be
wait
;
he
have
take
the
cushion
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
and
tell
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
shall
I
tell
him
?
"
say
Stephen
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
He
be
look
at
the
lip
now
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
make
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
go
,
"
Stephen
murmur
entreatingly
,
rise
,
and
take
her
hand
to
raise
her
too
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
long
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
they
go
.
<EOS>
Maggie
feel
that
she
be
be
lead
down
the
garden
among
the
rose
,
be
help
with
firm
,
tender
care
into
the
boat
,
have
the
cushion
and
cloak
arrange
for
her
foot
,
and
her
parasol
open
for
her
(
which
she
have
forget
)
,
all
by
this
strong
presence
that
seem
to
bear
her
along
without
any
act
of
her
own
will
,
like
the
add
self
which
come
with
the
sudden
exalting
influence
of
a
strong
tonic
,
and
she
feel
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
memory
be
exclude
.
  
<EOS>
They
glide
rapidly
along
,
Stephen
rowing
,
help
by
the
backward
-
flow
tide
,
past
the
Tofton
tree
and
house
;
on
between
the
silent
sunny
field
and
pasture
,
which
seem
fill
with
a
natural
joy
that
have
no
reproach
for
theirs
.
<EOS>
the
breath
of
the
young
,
unwearied
day
,
the
delicious
rhythmic
dip
of
the
oar
,
the
fragmentary
song
of
a
pass
bird
hear
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
if
it
be
only
the
overflowing
of
brimful
gladness
,
the
sweet
solitude
of
a
twofold
consciousness
that
be
mingle
into
one
by
that
grave
,
untire
gaze
which
nee
not
be
avert
,
 
what
else
could
there
be
in
their
mind
for
the
first
hour
?
<EOS>
some
low
,
subdue
,
languid
exclamation
of
love
come
from
Stephen
from
time
to
time
,
as
he
go
on
row
idly
,
half
automatically
;
otherwise
they
speak
no
word
;
for
what
could
word
have
be
but
an
inlet
to
think
?
<EOS>
and
thought
do
not
belong
to
that
enchant
haze
in
which
they
be
envelop
,
 
it
belong
to
the
past
and
the
future
that
lie
outside
the
haze
.
<EOS>
Maggie
be
only
dimly
conscious
of
the
bank
,
as
they
pass
them
,
and
dwelt
with
no
recognition
on
the
village
;
she
know
there
be
several
to
be
pass
before
they
reach
Luckreth
,
where
they
always
stop
and
leave
the
boat
.
<EOS>
at
all
time
she
be
so
liable
to
fit
of
absence
,
that
she
be
likely
enough
to
let
her
waymark
pass
unnoticed
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
Stephen
,
who
have
be
row
more
and
more
idly
,
cease
to
row
,
lay
down
the
oar
,
fold
his
arm
,
and
look
down
on
the
water
as
if
watch
the
pace
at
which
the
boat
glide
without
his
help
.
<EOS>
this
sudden
change
rouse
Maggie
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
the
far
-
stretch
field
,
at
the
bank
close
by
,
and
feel
that
they
be
entirely
strange
to
her
.
<EOS>
a
terrible
alarm
take
possession
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
have
we
pass
Luckreth
,
where
we
be
to
stop
?
<EOS>
"
she
exclaim
,
look
back
to
see
if
the
place
be
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
no
village
be
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
She
turn
around
again
,
with
a
look
of
distressed
questioning
at
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
on
watch
the
water
,
and
say
,
in
a
strange
,
dreamy
,
absent
tone
,
"
yes
,
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
shall
I
do
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Maggie
,
in
an
agony
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
get
home
for
hour
,
and
Lucy
?
<EOS>
o
God
,
help
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
clasp
her
hand
and
break
into
a
sob
,
like
a
frightened
child
;
she
think
of
nothing
but
of
meet
Lucy
,
and
see
her
look
of
pained
surprise
and
doubt
,
perhaps
of
just
upbraid
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
move
and
sit
near
her
,
and
gently
draw
down
the
clasped
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
deep
tone
of
slow
decision
,
"
let
us
never
go
home
again
,
till
no
one
can
part
us
,
 
till
we
be
married
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
unusual
tone
,
the
startling
word
,
arrest
Maggie
's
sob
,
and
she
sit
quite
still
,
wonder
;
as
if
Stephen
may
have
see
some
possibility
that
would
alter
everything
,
and
annul
the
wretched
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
see
,
Maggie
,
how
everything
have
come
without
our
seeking
,
 
in
spite
of
all
our
effort
.
<EOS>
We
never
think
of
be
alone
together
again
;
it
have
all
be
do
by
other
.
<EOS>
see
how
the
tide
be
carry
us
out
,
away
from
all
those
unnatural
bond
that
we
have
be
try
to
make
fast
round
us
,
and
try
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
will
carry
us
on
to
Torby
,
and
we
can
land
there
,
and
get
some
carriage
,
and
hurry
on
to
York
and
then
to
Scotland
,
 
and
never
pause
a
moment
till
we
be
bind
to
each
other
,
so
that
only
death
can
part
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
right
thing
,
dear
;
it
be
the
only
way
of
escape
from
this
wretched
entanglement
.
<EOS>
everything
have
concur
to
point
it
out
to
us
.
<EOS>
We
have
contrive
nothing
,
we
have
think
of
nothing
ourselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
Stephen
speak
with
deep
,
earnest
pleading
.
<EOS>
Maggie
listen
,
pass
from
her
startled
wonderment
to
the
yearning
after
that
belief
that
the
tide
be
do
it
all
,
that
she
may
glide
along
with
the
swift
,
silent
stream
,
and
not
struggle
any
more
.
<EOS>
but
across
that
steal
influence
come
the
terrible
shadow
of
past
thought
;
and
the
sudden
horror
lest
now
,
at
last
,
the
moment
of
fatal
intoxication
be
close
upon
her
,
call
up
feeling
of
angry
resistance
toward
Stephen
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
go
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
in
an
agitated
tone
,
flash
an
indignant
look
at
him
,
and
try
to
get
her
hand
free
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
want
to
deprive
me
of
any
choice
.
<EOS>
You
know
we
be
come
too
far
;
you
have
dare
to
take
advantage
of
my
thoughtlessness
.
<EOS>
It
be
unmanly
to
bring
me
into
such
a
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
sting
by
this
reproach
,
he
release
her
hand
,
move
back
to
his
former
place
,
and
fold
his
arm
,
in
a
sort
of
desperation
at
the
difficulty
Maggie
's
word
have
make
present
to
him
.
<EOS>
if
she
would
not
consent
to
go
on
,
he
must
curse
himself
for
the
embarrassment
he
have
lead
her
into
.
<EOS>
but
the
reproach
be
the
unendurable
thing
;
the
one
thing
bad
than
part
with
her
be
,
that
she
should
feel
he
have
act
unworthily
toward
her
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
,
in
a
tone
of
suppress
rage
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
notice
that
we
have
pass
Luckreth
till
we
have
get
to
the
next
village
;
and
then
it
come
into
my
mind
that
we
would
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
justify
it
;
I
ought
to
have
tell
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
make
you
hate
me
,
since
you
do
not
love
me
well
enough
to
make
everything
else
indifferent
to
you
,
as
I
do
you
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
stop
the
boat
and
try
to
get
you
out
here
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
Lucy
that
I
be
mad
,
and
that
you
hate
me
;
and
you
shall
be
clear
of
me
forever
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
blame
you
,
because
I
have
behave
unpardonably
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
be
paralyze
;
it
be
easy
to
resist
Stephen
's
plead
than
this
picture
he
have
call
up
of
himself
suffer
while
she
be
vindicate
;
easy
even
to
turn
away
from
his
look
of
tenderness
than
from
this
look
of
angry
misery
,
that
seem
to
place
her
in
selfish
isolation
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
call
up
a
state
of
feeling
in
which
the
reason
which
have
act
on
her
conscience
seem
to
be
transmit
into
mere
self
-
regard
.
<EOS>
the
indignant
fire
in
her
eye
be
quench
,
and
she
begin
to
look
at
him
with
timid
distress
.
<EOS>
She
have
reproach
him
for
be
hurry
into
irrevocable
trespass
,
 
she
,
who
have
be
so
weak
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
if
I
should
not
feel
what
happen
to
you
 
just
the
same
,
"
she
say
,
with
reproach
of
another
kind
,
 
the
reproach
of
love
,
ask
for
more
trust
.
<EOS>
this
yield
to
the
idea
of
Stephen
's
suffering
be
more
fatal
than
the
other
yield
,
because
it
be
less
distinguishable
from
that
sense
of
other
'
claim
which
be
the
moral
basis
of
her
resistance
.
  
<EOS>
He
feel
all
the
relenting
in
her
look
and
tone
;
it
be
heaven
open
again
.
<EOS>
He
move
to
her
side
,
and
take
her
hand
,
lean
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
the
boat
,
and
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
dread
to
utter
another
word
,
he
dread
to
make
another
movement
,
that
may
provoke
another
reproach
or
denial
from
her
.
<EOS>
life
hang
on
her
consent
;
everything
else
be
hopeless
,
confused
,
sickening
misery
.
<EOS>
They
glide
along
in
this
way
,
both
rest
in
that
silence
as
in
a
haven
,
both
dread
lest
their
feeling
should
be
divide
again
,
 
till
they
become
aware
that
the
cloud
have
gather
,
and
that
the
slight
perceptible
freshening
of
the
breeze
be
grow
and
grow
,
so
that
the
whole
character
of
the
day
be
alter
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
chill
,
Maggie
,
in
this
thin
dress
.
<EOS>
let
me
raise
the
cloak
over
your
shoulder
.
<EOS>
get
up
an
instant
,
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
obey
;
there
be
an
unspeakable
charm
in
be
tell
what
to
do
,
and
have
everything
decide
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
sit
down
again
cover
with
the
cloak
,
and
Stephen
take
to
his
oar
again
,
make
haste
;
for
they
must
try
to
get
to
Torby
as
fast
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
Maggie
be
hardly
conscious
of
have
say
or
do
anything
decisive
.
<EOS>
all
yield
be
attend
with
a
less
vivid
consciousness
than
resistance
;
it
be
the
partial
sleep
of
thought
;
it
be
the
submergence
of
our
own
personality
by
another
.
<EOS>
every
influence
tend
to
lull
her
into
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
that
dreamy
glide
in
the
boat
which
have
last
for
four
hour
,
and
have
bring
some
weariness
and
exhaustion
;
the
recoil
of
her
fatigue
sensation
from
the
impracticable
difficulty
of
get
out
of
the
boat
at
this
unknown
distance
from
home
,
and
walk
for
long
mile
,
 
all
help
to
bring
her
into
more
complete
subjection
to
that
strong
,
mysterious
charm
which
make
a
last
parting
from
Stephen
<EOS>
seem
the
death
of
all
joy
,
and
make
the
thought
of
wound
him
like
the
first
touch
of
the
torturing
iron
before
which
resolution
shrink
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
the
present
happiness
of
be
with
him
,
which
be
enough
to
absorb
all
her
languid
energy
.
  
<EOS>
presently
Stephen
observe
a
vessel
come
after
them
.
<EOS>
several
vessel
,
among
them
the
steamer
to
Mudport
,
have
pass
them
with
the
early
tide
,
but
for
the
last
hour
they
have
see
none
.
<EOS>
He
look
more
and
more
eagerly
at
this
vessel
,
as
if
a
new
thought
have
come
into
his
mind
along
with
it
,
and
then
he
look
at
Maggie
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
dear
,
"
he
say
at
last
,
"
if
this
vessel
should
be
go
to
Mudport
,
or
to
any
convenient
place
on
the
coast
northward
,
it
would
be
our
good
plan
to
get
them
to
take
us
on
board
.
<EOS>
You
be
fatigue
,
and
it
may
soon
rain
;
it
may
be
a
wretched
business
,
get
to
Torby
in
this
boat
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
trading
vessel
,
but
I
dare
say
you
can
be
make
tolerably
comfortable
.
<EOS>
We
will
take
the
cushion
out
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
our
good
plan
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
glad
enough
to
take
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
plenty
of
money
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
pay
them
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
heart
begin
to
beat
with
reawaken
alarm
at
this
new
proposition
;
but
she
be
silent
,
 
one
course
seem
as
difficult
as
another
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
hail
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dutch
vessel
go
to
Mudport
,
the
english
mate
inform
him
,
and
,
if
this
wind
hold
,
would
be
there
in
less
than
two
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
get
out
too
far
with
our
boat
,
"
say
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
try
to
make
for
Torby
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
of
the
weather
;
and
this
lady
 
<EOS>
my
wife
 
will
be
exhaust
with
fatigue
and
hunger
.
<EOS>
take
us
on
board
 
will
you
?
 
and
haul
up
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
will
pay
you
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
now
really
faint
and
tremble
with
fear
,
be
take
on
board
,
make
an
interesting
object
of
contemplation
to
admire
dutchman
.
<EOS>
the
mate
fear
the
lady
would
have
a
poor
time
of
it
on
board
,
for
they
have
no
accommodation
for
such
entirely
unlooke
-
for
passenger
,
 
no
private
cabin
large
than
an
old
-
fashioned
church
-
pew
.
<EOS>
but
at
least
they
have
dutch
cleanliness
,
which
make
all
other
inconvenience
tolerable
;
and
the
boat
cushion
be
spread
into
a
couch
for
Maggie
on
the
poop
with
all
alacrity
.
<EOS>
but
to
pace
up
and
down
the
deck
lean
on
Stephen
 
be
uphold
by
his
strength
 
be
the
first
change
that
she
need
;
then
come
food
,
and
then
quiet
reclining
on
the
cushion
,
with
the
sense
that
no
new
resolution
_
could
_
be
take
that
day
.
<EOS>
everything
must
wait
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Stephen
sit
beside
her
with
her
hand
in
his
;
they
could
only
speak
to
each
other
in
low
tone
;
only
look
at
each
other
now
and
then
,
for
it
would
take
a
long
while
to
dull
the
curiosity
of
the
five
man
on
board
,
and
reduce
these
handsome
young
stranger
to
that
minor
degree
of
interest
which
belong
,
in
a
sailor
's
regard
,
to
all
object
near
than
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
but
Stephen
be
triumphantly
happy
.
<EOS>
every
other
thought
or
care
be
throw
into
unmarked
perspective
by
the
certainty
that
Maggie
must
be
his
.
<EOS>
the
leap
have
be
take
now
;
he
have
be
torture
by
scruple
,
he
have
fight
fiercely
with
overmaster
inclination
,
he
have
hesitate
;
but
repentance
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
murmur
forth
in
fragmentary
sentence
his
happiness
,
his
adoration
,
his
tenderness
,
his
belief
that
their
life
together
must
be
heaven
,
that
her
presence
with
him
would
give
rapture
to
every
common
day
;
that
to
satisfy
her
light
wish
be
dearer
to
him
than
all
other
bliss
;
that
everything
be
easy
for
her
sake
,
except
to
part
with
her
;
and
now
they
never
_
<EOS>
would
_
part
;
he
would
belong
to
her
forever
,
and
<EOS>
all
that
be
his
be
her
<EOS>
,
 
have
no
value
for
him
except
as
it
be
her
.
<EOS>
such
thing
,
utter
in
low
,
broken
tone
by
the
one
voice
that
have
first
stir
the
fibre
of
young
passion
,
have
only
a
feeble
effect
 
on
experienced
mind
at
a
distance
from
them
.
<EOS>
to
poor
Maggie
they
be
very
near
;
they
be
like
nectar
hold
close
to
thirsty
lip
;
there
be
,
there
<EOS>
_
must
_
be
,
then
,
a
life
for
mortal
here
below
which
be
not
hard
and
chill
,
 
in
which
affection
would
no
longer
be
self
-
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
Stephen
's
passionate
word
make
the
vision
of
such
a
life
more
fully
present
to
her
than
it
have
ever
be
before
;
and
the
vision
for
the
time
exclude
all
reality
,
 
all
except
the
return
sun
-
gleam
which
break
out
on
the
water
as
the
evening
approach
,
and
mingle
with
the
visionary
sunlight
of
promised
happiness
;
all
except
the
hand
that
press
her
,
and
the
voice
that
speak
to
her
,
and
the
eye
that
look
at
her
with
grave
,
unspeakable
love
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
no
rain
,
after
all
;
the
cloud
roll
off
to
the
horizon
again
,
make
the
great
purple
rampart
and
long
purple
isle
of
that
wondrous
land
which
reveal
itself
to
us
when
the
sun
go
down
,
 
the
land
that
the
evening
star
watch
over
.
<EOS>
Maggie
be
to
sleep
all
night
on
the
poop
;
it
be
well
than
go
below
;
and
she
be
cover
with
the
warm
wrapping
the
ship
could
furnish
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
early
,
when
the
fatigue
of
the
day
bring
on
a
drowsy
longing
for
perfect
rest
,
and
she
lay
down
her
head
,
look
at
the
faint
,
die
flush
in
the
west
,
where
the
one
golden
lamp
be
get
bright
and
bright
.
<EOS>
then
she
look
up
at
Stephen
,
who
be
still
seat
by
her
,
hang
over
her
as
he
lean
his
arm
against
the
vessel
's
side
.
<EOS>
behind
all
the
delicious
vision
of
these
last
hour
,
which
have
flow
over
her
like
a
soft
stream
,
and
make
her
entirely
passive
,
there
be
the
dim
consciousness
that
the
condition
be
a
transient
one
,
and
that
the
morrow
must
bring
back
the
old
life
of
struggle
;
that
there
be
thought
which
would
presently
avenge
themselves
for
this
oblivion
.
<EOS>
but
now
nothing
be
distinct
to
her
;
she
be
be
lull
to
sleep
with
that
soft
stream
still
flow
over
her
,
with
those
delicious
vision
melt
and
fade
like
the
wondrous
aerial
land
of
the
west
.
    
<EOS>
wake
  
<EOS>
when
Maggie
be
go
to
sleep
,
Stephen
,
weary
too
with
his
unaccustomed
amount
of
rowing
,
and
with
the
intense
inward
life
of
the
last
twelve
hour
,
but
too
restless
to
sleep
,
walk
and
lounge
about
the
deck
with
his
cigar
far
on
into
midnight
,
not
see
the
dark
water
,
hardly
conscious
there
be
star
,
live
only
in
the
near
and
distant
future
.
<EOS>
at
last
fatigue
conquer
restlessness
,
and
he
roll
himself
up
in
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
on
the
deck
near
Maggie
's
foot
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
fall
asleep
before
nine
,
and
have
be
sleep
for
six
hour
before
the
faint
hint
of
a
midsummer
daybreak
be
discernible
.
<EOS>
She
awake
from
that
vivid
dreaming
which
make
the
margin
of
our
deep
rest
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
boat
on
the
wide
water
with
Stephen
,
and
in
the
gathering
darkness
something
like
a
star
appear
,
that
grow
and
grow
till
they
see
it
be
the
Virgin
seat
in
St.
Ogg
's
boat
,
and
it
come
nearer
and
nearer
,
till
they
see
the
Virgin
be
Lucy
and
the
boatman
<EOS>
be
Philip
,
 
no
,
not
Philip
,
but
her
brother
,
who
row
past
without
look
at
her
;
and
she
rise
to
stretch
out
her
arm
and
call
to
him
,
and
their
own
boat
turn
over
with
the
movement
,
and
they
begin
to
sink
,
till
with
one
spasm
of
dread
she
seem
to
awake
,
and
find
she
be
a
child
again
in
the
parlor
at
evening
twilight
,
and
Tom
be
not
really
angry
.
<EOS>
from
the
soothed
sense
of
that
false
waking
she
pass
to
the
real
waking
,
 
to
the
plash
of
water
against
the
vessel
,
and
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
deck
,
and
the
awful
starlit
sky
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
moment
of
utter
bewilderment
before
her
mind
could
get
disentangle
from
the
confused
web
of
dream
;
but
soon
the
whole
terrible
truth
urge
itself
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Stephen
be
not
by
her
now
;
she
be
alone
with
her
own
memory
and
her
own
dread
.
<EOS>
the
irrevocable
wrong
that
must
blot
her
life
have
be
commit
;
she
have
bring
sorrow
into
the
life
of
other
,
 
into
the
life
that
be
knit
up
with
her
by
trust
and
love
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
of
a
few
short
week
have
hurry
her
into
the
sin
her
nature
have
most
recoil
from
,
 
breach
of
faith
and
cruel
selfishness
;
she
have
rend
the
tie
that
have
give
meaning
to
duty
,
and
have
make
herself
an
outlaw
soul
,
with
no
guide
but
the
wayward
choice
of
her
own
passion
.
<EOS>
and
where
would
that
lead
her
?
<EOS>
where
have
it
lead
her
now
?
<EOS>
She
have
say
she
would
rather
die
than
fall
into
that
temptation
.
<EOS>
She
feel
it
now
,
 
now
that
the
consequence
of
such
a
fall
have
come
before
the
outward
act
be
complete
.
<EOS>
there
be
at
least
this
fruit
from
all
her
year
of
strive
after
the
high
and
good
,
 
that
her
soul
though
betray
,
beguile
,
ensnared
,
could
never
deliberately
consent
to
a
choice
of
the
low
.
<EOS>
and
a
choice
of
what
?
<EOS>
o
God
!
<EOS>
not
a
choice
of
joy
,
but
of
conscious
cruelty
and
hardness
;
for
could
she
ever
cease
to
see
before
her
Lucy
and
Philip
,
with
their
murder
trust
and
hope
?
<EOS>
Her
life
with
Stephen
could
have
no
sacredness
;
she
must
forever
sink
and
wander
vaguely
,
drive
by
uncertain
impulse
;
for
she
have
let
go
the
clue
of
life
,
 
that
clue
which
once
in
the
far
-
off
year
her
young
need
have
clutch
so
strongly
.
<EOS>
She
have
renounce
all
delight
then
,
before
she
know
them
,
before
they
have
come
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
Philip
have
be
right
when
he
tell
her
that
she
know
nothing
of
renunciation
;
she
have
think
it
be
quiet
ecstasy
;
she
see
it
face
to
face
now
,
 
that
sad
,
patient
,
love
strength
which
hold
the
clue
of
life
,
 
and
see
that
the
thorn
be
forever
press
on
its
brow
.
<EOS>
the
yesterday
,
which
could
never
be
revoke
,
 
if
she
could
have
change
it
now
for
any
length
of
inward
silent
endurance
,
she
would
have
bow
beneath
that
cross
with
a
sense
of
rest
.
  
<EOS>
day
break
come
and
the
redden
eastern
light
,
while
her
past
life
be
grasp
her
in
this
way
,
with
that
tightening
clutch
which
come
in
the
last
moment
of
possible
rescue
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
Stephen
now
lie
on
the
deck
still
fast
asleep
,
and
with
the
sight
of
him
there
come
a
wave
of
anguish
that
find
its
way
in
a
long
-
suppress
sob
.
<EOS>
the
bad
bitterness
of
part
 
<EOS>
the
thought
that
urge
the
sharp
inward
cry
for
help
 
be
the
pain
it
must
give
to
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
but
surmount
everything
be
the
horror
at
her
own
possible
failure
,
the
dread
lest
her
conscience
should
be
benumb
again
,
and
not
rise
to
energy
till
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
too
late
!
<EOS>
it
be
too
late
already
not
to
have
cause
misery
;
too
late
for
everything
,
perhaps
,
but
to
rush
away
from
the
last
act
of
baseness
,
 
the
tasting
of
joy
that
be
wrung
from
crushed
heart
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
be
rise
now
,
and
Maggie
start
up
with
the
sense
that
a
day
of
resistance
be
begin
for
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eyelash
be
still
wet
with
tear
,
as
,
with
her
shawl
over
her
head
,
she
sit
look
at
the
slowly
round
sun
.
<EOS>
something
rouse
Stephen
too
,
and
get
up
from
his
hard
bed
,
he
come
to
sit
beside
her
.
<EOS>
the
sharp
instinct
of
anxious
love
see
something
to
give
him
alarm
in
the
very
first
glance
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
hovering
dread
of
some
resistance
in
Maggie
's
nature
that
he
would
be
unable
to
overcome
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
uneasy
consciousness
that
he
have
rob
her
of
perfect
freedom
yesterday
;
there
be
too
much
native
honor
in
him
,
for
him
not
to
feel
that
,
if
her
will
should
recoil
,
his
conduct
would
have
be
odious
,
and
she
would
have
a
right
to
reproach
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
Maggie
do
not
feel
that
right
;
she
be
too
conscious
of
fatal
weakness
in
herself
,
too
full
of
the
tenderness
that
come
with
the
foreseen
need
for
inflict
a
wound
.
<EOS>
She
let
him
take
her
hand
when
he
come
to
sit
down
beside
her
,
and
smile
at
him
,
only
with
rather
a
sad
glance
;
she
could
say
nothing
to
pain
him
till
the
moment
of
possible
parting
be
near
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
drank
their
cup
of
coffee
together
,
and
walk
about
the
deck
,
and
hear
the
captain
's
assurance
that
they
should
be
in
at
Mudport
by
five
o'clock
,
each
with
an
inward
burthen
;
but
in
him
it
be
an
undefined
fear
,
which
he
trust
to
the
come
hour
to
dissipate
;
in
her
it
be
a
definite
resolve
on
which
she
be
try
silently
to
tighten
her
hold
.
<EOS>
Stephen
be
continually
,
through
the
morning
,
express
his
anxiety
at
the
fatigue
and
discomfort
she
be
suffer
,
and
allude
to
landing
and
to
the
change
of
motion
and
repose
she
would
have
in
a
carriage
,
want
to
assure
himself
more
completely
by
presuppose
that
everything
would
be
as
he
have
arrange
it
.
<EOS>
for
a
long
while
Maggie
content
herself
with
assure
him
that
she
have
have
a
good
night
's
rest
,
and
that
she
do
not
mind
about
be
on
the
vessel
,
 
it
be
not
like
be
on
the
open
sea
,
it
be
only
a
little
less
pleasant
than
be
in
a
boat
on
the
Floss
.
<EOS>
but
a
suppress
resolve
will
betray
itself
in
the
eye
,
and
Stephen
become
more
and
more
uneasy
as
the
day
advance
,
under
the
sense
that
Maggie
have
entirely
lose
her
passiveness
.
<EOS>
He
long
,
but
do
not
dare
,
to
speak
of
their
marriage
,
of
where
they
would
go
after
it
,
and
the
step
he
would
take
to
inform
his
father
,
and
the
rest
,
of
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
He
long
to
assure
himself
of
a
tacit
assent
from
her
.
<EOS>
but
each
time
he
look
at
her
,
he
gather
a
strong
dread
of
the
new
,
quiet
sadness
with
which
she
meet
his
eye
.
<EOS>
and
they
be
more
and
more
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
we
be
in
sight
of
Mudport
,
"
he
say
at
last
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
dear
,
"
he
add
,
turn
toward
her
with
a
look
that
be
half
beseech
,
"
the
bad
part
of
your
fatigue
be
over
.
<EOS>
on
the
land
we
can
command
swiftness
.
<EOS>
in
another
hour
and
a
half
we
shall
be
in
a
chaise
together
,
and
that
will
seem
rest
to
you
after
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
feel
it
be
time
to
speak
;
it
would
only
be
unkind
now
to
assent
by
silence
.
<EOS>
She
speak
in
the
low
tone
,
as
he
have
do
,
but
with
distinct
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
together
;
we
shall
have
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
blood
rush
to
Stephen
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
die
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
he
have
dread
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
struggle
come
.
<EOS>
but
neither
of
them
dare
to
say
another
word
till
the
boat
be
let
down
,
and
they
be
take
to
the
landing
-
place
.
<EOS>
here
there
be
a
cluster
of
gazer
and
passenger
await
the
departure
of
the
steamboat
to
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
a
dim
sense
,
when
she
have
land
,
and
Stephen
be
hurry
her
along
on
his
arm
,
that
some
one
have
advance
toward
her
from
that
cluster
as
if
he
be
come
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
hurry
along
,
and
be
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
come
trial
.
  
<EOS>
a
porter
guide
them
to
the
near
inn
and
posting

house
,
and
Stephen
give
the
order
for
the
chaise
as
they
pass
through
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Maggie
take
no
notice
of
this
,
and
only
say
,
"
ask
them
to
show
us
into
a
room
where
we
can
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
they
enter
,
Maggie
do
not
sit
down
,
and
Stephen
,
whose
face
have
a
desperate
determination
in
it
,
be
about
to
ring
the
bell
,
when
she
say
,
in
a
firm
voice
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
;
we
must
part
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
he
say
,
turn
round
toward
her
,
and
speak
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
feel
a
process
of
torture
beginning
,
"
do
you
mean
to
kill
me
?
<EOS>
what

the
use

the

no

it

Maggie

<EOS>
"
too
much
be

more
than
we

I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
dare
not
go
near
her
;
her
anger
may
leap
out
,
and
make
a
new
barrier
.
<EOS>
He
walk
backward
and
forward
in
madden
perplexity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
he
say
at
last
,
pause
before
her
,
and
speak
in
a
tone
of
implore
wretchedness
,
"
have
some
pity
 
<EOS>
hear
me
 
forgive
me
for
what
I

<EOS>
I
will
obey
you
now
;
I
will
do
nothing
without
your
full
consent

<EOS>
but
do
not
blight
our
life
forever
by
a
rash
perversity
that
can
answer
no

any

that
can

<EOS>
sit
down
,
dear
<EOS>
;
wait
 
think
what
you

go
to
do

<EOS>
do
not
treat
me
as

you
could
not
trust
me

"
  
<EOS>
He
have
choose
the
most
effective
appeal
;
but
Maggie
's
will
be
fix
unswervingly
on
the
come
wrench
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
up
her
mind
to
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
wait
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
;
"
we

<EOS>
"
We

Maggie

say
Stephen
,
more
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
inflicting
that
misery
on
me
?
<EOS>
the
blow
 
whatever
it
may
have
be
 
have
be
strike
now

Will
it
help
any

mad

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
begin
any
future
,
even
for
you
,
"
say
Maggie
,
tremulously
,
"
with
a
deliberate
consent
to
what
ought
not
to
have
be

<EOS>
what
I
tell
you
at
Basset
<EOS>
I
feel
now
;
I
would
rather
have
die
than
fall
into
this
temptation
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
if
we
have
part
forever
then

we
must
part
now

<EOS>
"
We
will
_
not

,
"
Stephen
burst
out
,
instinctively
place
his
back
against
the
door
,
forget
everything
he
have
say
a
few
moment
before
;
"
I
will
not
endure
it

<EOS>
You
will
make
me
desperate
;
I
sha'n"t
know
what
I

"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
tremble
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
the
parting
could
not
be
effect
suddenly
.
<EOS>
She
must
rely
on
a
slow
appeal
to
Stephen
's
well
self
;
she
must
be
prepare
for
a
hard
task
than
that
of
rush
away
while
resolution
be
fresh
.
<EOS>
She
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Stephen
,
watch
her
with
that
look
of
desperation
which
have
come
over
him
like
a
lurid
light
,
approach
slowly
from
the
door
,
seat
himself
close
beside
her
,
and
grasp
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
like
the
heart
of
a
frightened
bird
;
but
this
direct
opposition
help
her
.
<EOS>
She
feel
her
determination
grow
strong
.
  
<EOS>
"
remember
what
you
feel
week
ago
,
"
she
begin
,
with
beseech
earnestness
;
"
remember
what
we
both
feel
,
 
that
we
owe
ourselves
to
other
,
and
must
conquer
every
inclination
which
could
make
us
false
to
that
debt
.
<EOS>
We
have
fail
to
keep
our
resolution
;
but
the
wrong
remain
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
do
_
not
<EOS>
_
remain
the
same
,
"
say
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
prove
that
it
be
impossible
to
keep
our
resolution
.
<EOS>
We
have
prove
that
the
feeling
which
draw
us
toward
each
other
be
too
strong
to
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
that
natural
law
surmount
every

we

what
it
clash
with

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
,
Stephen
;
I
be
quite
sure
that
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
to
think
it
again
and
again
;
but
I
see
,
if
we
judge
in
that
way
,
there
would
be
a
warrant
for
all
treachery
and
cruelty
;
we
should
justify
break
the
most
sacred
tie
that
can
ever
be
form
on
earth
.
<EOS>
if
the
past
be
not

bind
us
,
where
can
duty
lie
?
<EOS>
We
should
have
no
law
but
<EOS>
the
inclination
of
the
moment

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
tie
that
can
not
be
keep
by
mere
resolution
,
"
say
Stephen
,
start
up
and
walk
about
again
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
outward
faithfulness
?
<EOS>
Would
they
have
thank
us
for
anything
so
hollow
as
constancy
without
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
do
not
answer
immediately
.
<EOS>
She
be
undergo
an
inward
as
well
as
an
outward
contest
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
say
,
with
a
passionate
assertion
of
her
conviction
,
as
much
against
herself
as
against
him
,
    
"
that
seem
right
 
at
first
;
but
when
I
look
further
,
I
be
sure
it
be
_
not
_
right
.
<EOS>
faithfulness
and
constancy
mean
something
else
besides
do
what
be
easy
and
pleasant
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
They
mean
renounce
whatever
be
oppose
to
the
reliance
other
have
in
us
,
 
whatever
would
cause
misery
to
those
whom
the
course
of
our
life
have
make
dependent
on
us
.
<EOS>
if
we
 
if
I
have
be
well
,
noble
,
those
claim
would
have
be
so
strongly
present
with
me
,
 
I
should
have
feel
them
press
on
my
heart
so
continually
,
just
as
they
do
now
in
the
moment
when
my
conscience
be
awake
,
 
that
the
opposite
feeling
would
never
have
grow
in
me
,
as
it
have
do
;
it
would
have
be
quench
at
once
,
I
should
have
pray
for
help
so
earnestly
,
I
should
have
rush
away
as
we
rush
from
hideous
danger
.
<EOS>
I
feel
no
excuse
for
myself
,
none
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
fail
toward
Lucy
and
Philip
as
I
have
do
,
if
I
have
not
be
weak
,
selfish
,
and
hard

able
to
think
of
their
pain
without
a

to
myself
that
would
have
destroy
all
temptation

<EOS>
oh
,
what
be
Lucy
feel
now
?
<EOS>
She
believe
in
me
 
she
love
me
 
<EOS>
she
be
so
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
think
of
her

Maggie
's
voice
be
get
choke
as
she
utter
these
last
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

Stephen
,

as

with
pain

I
can
think
of
nothing
<EOS>

you
,
Maggie

<EOS>
You
demand
of
a
man
what
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
once
;
but
I
can
not
go
back
to
it
now
.
<EOS>
and
where
be
the
use
of
_
your
_
thinking
of
it
,
except
to
torture
me
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
save
them
from
pain
now
;
you
can
only
tear
yourself
from
me
,
and
make
my
life
worthless
to
me

<EOS>
and
even
if
we
could
go
back
,
and
both
fulfil
our
engagement
,
 
if
that
be
possible
now
,
 
it
would
be
hateful

horrible

of
your
ever

Philip

of
your
ever

the
wife
of

We
have
both
be
rescue
from
a
mistake

<EOS>
a
deep
flush
come
over
Maggie
's
face
,
and
she
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
Stephen
see
this
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
again
,
take
her
hand
in
his
,

at
her
with
passionate
entreaty

Maggie

in

raise
her
eye

his
with
a
glance
that

with
the
anguish
of
regret

not
with

"
no

not

I

there
be
memory

and
affection

longing
after
perfect
goodness

that
have
such
a
strong
hold
on
me

they
would
never

me
for
long

come
back

sorrow

up

down

suppress
rage

Maggie
press

I

I

I

We

happiness
either
for

for
another

we

not
tell
where
that

lie

<EOS>
We
can

whether

indulge
ourselves

<EOS>
I
know
this
belief
be
hard
;
it
have
slip
away
from
me
again

again
;

I
have
feel
that

I
should
have
no
light
through

"
  
<EOS>

but
,
Maggie

"

seat
himself
by

be
it

you
do
not

what

be
it

what
obstinate

that
blind
you
to

<EOS>
It
be
too
late
to

what

<EOS>
admit
the

it

We

afresh

suppose
we

It

nearly
the

the
effect

<EOS>
It

only
have
make
this

Stephen
add
bitterly

that
you
may
have
acknowledge
then

<EOS>
again
a
deep
flush
come
over
Maggie

she
be
silent

Stephen

again
that

he
have
never

there

shrink

<EOS>
"

he
say

in

lean

round

<EOS>
Maggie

open
wide

be
close

she
start
up

pale
again

<EOS>
"
oh

I

she

in

of

Stephen

I
can

It

I

<EOS>
Stephen
let
go
her
arm
,
and
sink
back
on
his
chair
,
half
-
stunned
by
despair
rage

He
be
silent
a
few
moment
,
not

while
her
eye
be
turn
toward

in

<EOS>
at

he

still
without

"
  
<EOS>
involuntarily
she
lean
toward
him

put
out
her
hand
to
touch
his

<EOS>
but
he
shrink
from
it
as
if

again
,
    
"

<EOS>
Maggie
be
not
conscious
of
a
decision
as
she
turn
away
from
that
gloomy
avert
face
,
and
walk
out
of
the
room
;
it
be
like
an
automatic
action
that
fulfil
a
forget
intention

<EOS>
what
come
after
?
<EOS>
a
sense
of
stair
descend
as
if
in
a
dream
,
of
flagstone
,
of
a
chaise
and
horse
standing
,
then
a
street
,
and
a
turning
into
another
street
where
a
stage
-
coach
be
stand
,
take
in
passenger
,
and
the
dart
thought
that
that
coach
would
take
her
away
,
perhaps
toward
home
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
ask
nothing
yet
;
she
only
get
into
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
home
 
<EOS>
where
her
mother
and
brother
be
,
Philip
,
Lucy
,
<EOS>
the
scene
of
her
very
care
and
trial
 
be
the
haven
toward
which
her
mind
tend
;
the
sanctuary
where
sacred
relic
lay
,
where
she
would
be
rescue
from
more
falling
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
Stephen
be
like
a
horrible
throbbing
pain
,
which
yet
,
as
such
pain
do
,
seem
to
urge
all
other
thought
into
activity
.
<EOS>
but
among
her
thought
,
what
other
would
say
and
think
of
her
conduct
be
hardly
present
.
<EOS>
love
and
deep
pity
and
remorseful
anguish
leave
no
room
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
the
coach
be
take
her
to
York
,
farther
away
from
home
;
but
she
do
not
learn
that
until
she
be
set
down
in
the
old
city
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
matter
;
she
could
sleep
there
,
and
start
home
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
purse
in
her
pocket
,
with
all
her
money
in
it
,
 
a
bank
-
note
and
a
sovereign
;
she
have
keep
it
in
her
pocket
from
forgetfulness
,
after
go
out
to
make
purchase
the
day
before
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
do
she
lie
down
in
the
gloomy
bedroom
of
the
old
inn
that
night
with
her
will
bent
unwaveringly
on
the
path
of
penitent
sacrifice
?
<EOS>
the
great
struggle
of
life
be
not
so
easy
as
that
;
the
great
problem
of
life
be
not
so
clear
.
<EOS>
in
the
darkness
of
that
night
she
see
Stephen
's
face
turn
toward
her
in
passionate
,
reproachful
misery
;
she
live
through
again
all
the
tremulous
delight
of
his
presence
with
her
that
make
existence
an
easy
floating
in
a
stream
of
joy
,
instead
of
a
quiet
resolve
endurance
and
effort
.
<EOS>
the
love
she
have
renounce
come
back
upon
her
with
a
cruel
charm
;
she
feel
herself
open
her
arm
to
receive
it
once
more
;
and
then
it
seem
to
slip
away
and
fade
and
vanish
,
leave
only
the
die
sound
of
a
deep
,
thrilling
voice
that

"
go

forever

the

on

St.
Ogg

Tom
Tulliver
be
stand
on
the
gravel
walk
outside
the
old
house
at
Dorlcote
Mill
.
<EOS>
He
be
master
there
now
;
he
have
half
fulfil
his
father
's
dying
wish
,
and
by
year
of
steady
self

government
and
energetic
work
he
have
bring
himself
near
to
the
attainment
of
more
than

old
respectability
which
have
be
the
proud
inheritance
of
the
Dodsons
and

<EOS>
but
Tom
's
face

as
he
stand
in
the
hot
,
still
sunshine
of
that
summer
afternoon

have
no
gladness
,
no
triumph
in
it

<EOS>
His
mouth
wear
its
bitter
expression
,
his
severe
brow
its
hard
and
deep
fold
,
as
he
draw
down
his
hat
farther
over
his
eye
to
shelter
them
from
the
sun
,
and
thrust
his
hand
deep
into
his
pocket
,
begin
to
walk
up
and
down
the
gravel
.
<EOS>
no
news
of
his
sister
have
be
hear
since
Bob
Jakin
have
come
back
in
the
steamer
from
Mudport

put
an
end
to
all
improbable
supposition

on

by
state
that

see
her
land
from

Would
the
next
news
be
that
she
be
married
,
 
or
what
?
<EOS>
probably
that
she
be
not
married
;
Tom
's
mind
be
set
to
the
expectation
of
the
bad
that
could
happen
,
 
not
death
,

disgrace

as
he
be
walk
with
his
back
toward

toward
the

dark

figure
,
that
we
know
well
,
approach
the
gate
,
and
pause
to
look
at
him
with
a
fast
-
beat
heart
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
be
the
human
being
of
whom
she
have
be
most
afraid
from
her
childhood
upward
;
afraid
with
that
fear
which
spring
in
us
when
we
love
one
who
be
inexorable
,
unbending
,
unmodifiable
,
with
a
mind
that
we
can
never
mould
ourselves
upon
,
and
yet
that
we
can
not
endure
to
alienate
from
us
.
  
<EOS>
that
deep

root
fear
be
shake
Maggie

her
mind
be
unswervingly
bent
on
return
to
her

,
as
the
natural
refuge
that
have
be
give
her

<EOS>
in
her
deep
humiliation
under
the
retrospect
of
her
own
weakness
,
 
in
her
anguish
at
the
injury
she
have
inflict

she
almost
desire

reproof
,
to
submit
in
patient
silence
to
that
harsh
,
disapproving
judgment
against
which
she
have
so
often
rebel
;
it
seem
no
more
than
just
to
her
now
,
 
who
be
weak
than
she
be
?
<EOS>
She
crave
that
outward
help
to
her
well
purpose
which
would
come
from
complete
,
submissive
confession
;
from
be
in
the
presence
of
those
whose
look
and
word
would
be
a
reflection
of
her
own
conscience

<EOS>
Maggie
have
be
keep
on
her
bed
at
York
for
a
day
with
that
prostrate
headache
which
be
likely
to
follow
on
the
terrible
strain
of
the
previous
day
and
night

<EOS>
there
be
an
expression
of
physical

still
about

then
close

dam

he
presently
turn
,
and
lift
up
his
eye
,
see
the
figure
whose
worn
look
and
loneliness
seem
to
him
a
confirmation
of
his
bad
conjecture

He
pause
,
tremble

Maggie

three

out

<EOS>
"
no

Maggie
,
in
a
low
tone
,
like
a
moan
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
wait
for

outside

<EOS>
I
will

come

"
  
<EOS>
when
his
mother
appear
with
her
bonnet
on
,
Tom
come
out
to
her
in
the
passage

and
put
money
into

<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
take
the
money
,
too
frightened
to
say
anything
.
<EOS>
the
only
thing
clear
to
her
be
the
mother
's
instinct
that
she
would
go
with

unhappy

<EOS>
Maggie
be
wait
outside
the
gate

she
take
her

they
walk
a
little
way
in
silence

<EOS>
"
Mother

Maggie

at

I
do
not

where
to
go

be
not

<EOS>
one
o

your
aunt

I
hardly
durst

say
poor
Mrs.
Tulliver
,
quite
destitute
of
mental
resource
in
this
extremity
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
be
silent
a
little
while
,
and
then
say
,
    
"
let
us
go
to
Bob
Jakin
's
,
mother
;
his
wife
will
have
room
for
us
,
if
they
have
no
other
lodger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
they
go
on
their
way
to
St.
Ogg
's
,
to
the
old
house
by
the
river
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
Bob
himself
be
at
home
,
with
a
heaviness
at
heart
which
resist
even
the
new
joy
and
pride
of
possess
a
two
-
month
'
 
old
baby
,
quite
the
lively
of
its
age
that
have
ever
be
bear
to
prince
or
packman
.
<EOS>
He
would
perhaps
not
so
thoroughly
have
understand
all
the
dubiousness
of
Maggie
's
appearance
with
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
on
the
quay
at
Mudport
if
he
have
not
witness
the
effect
it
produce
on
Tom
when
he
go
to
report
it
;
and
since
then
,
the
circumstance
which
in
any
case
give
a
disastrous
character
to
her
elopement
have
pass
beyond
the
more
polite
circle
of
St.
Ogg
's
,
and
have
become
matter
of
common
talk
,
accessible
to
the
groom
and
errand
-
boy
.
<EOS>
so
that
when
he
open
the
door
and
see
Maggie
stand
before
him
in
her
sorrow
and
weariness
,
he
have
no
question
to
ask
except
one
which
he
dare
only
ask
himself
,
 
where
be
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
?
<EOS>
Bob
,
for
his
part
,
hope
he
may
be
in
the
warm
department
of
an
asylum
understand
to
exist
in
the
other
world
for
gentleman
who
be
likely
to
be
in
fall
circumstance
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
lodging
be
vacant
,
and
both
Mrs.
Jakin
the
large
and
Mrs.
Jakin
the
less
be
command
to
make
all
thing
comfortable
for
"
the
old
Missis
and
the
young
Miss
"
;
alas
that
she
be
still
"
Miss
!
"
<EOS>
the
ingenious
Bob
be
sorely
perplex
as
to
how
this
result
could
have
come
about
;
how
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
could
have
go
away
from
her
,
or
could
have
let
her
go
away
from
him
,
when
he
have
the
chance
of
keep
her
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
silent
,
and
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
ask
him
a
question
;
would
not
present
himself
in
the
room
,
lest
it
should
appear
like
intrusion
and
a
wish
to
pry
;
have
the
same
chivalry
toward
dark
-
eyed
Maggie
as
in
the
day
when
he
have
buy
her
the
memorable
present
of
book
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
a
day
or
two
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
go
to
the
Mill
again
for
a
few
hour
to
see
to
Tom
's
household
matter
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
wish
this
;
after
the
first
violent
outburst
of
feeling
which
come
as
soon
as
she
have
no
longer
any
active
purpose
to
fulfil
,
she
be
less
in
need
of
her
mother
's
presence
;
she
even
desire
to
be
alone
with
her
grief
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
be
solitary
only
a
little
while
in
the
old
sitting
-
room
that
look
on
the
river
,
when
there
come
a
tap
at
the
door
,
and
turn
round
her
sad
face
as
she
say
"
come
in
,
"
she
see
Bob
enter
,
with
the
baby
in
his
arm
and
Mumps
at
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
back
,
if
it
disturb
you

Miss

"
say
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
Maggie
,
in
a
low
voice
,
wish
she
could
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Bob
,
close
the
door
behind
him
,
come
and
stand
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
we
have
get
a

<EOS>
Maggie
could
not
speak
,
but
she
put
out
her
arm
to
receive
the
tiny
baby
,
while
Mumps
snuff
at
it
anxiously
,
to
ascertain
that
this
transference
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
Maggie
's
heart
have
swell
at
this
action
and
speech
of
Bob
's
;
she
know
well
enough
that
it
be
a
way
he
have
choose
to
show
his
sympathy
and
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
Bob

"
she
say
presently
,
and
he
sit
down
in
silence
,
find
his
tongue
unmanageable
in
quite
a
new
fashion
,
refuse
to
say
what
he
want
it
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bob
,
"
she
say
,
after
a
few
moment
,
look
down
at
the
baby
,
and
hold
it
anxiously
,
as
if
she
fear
it
may
slip
from
her
mind
and
her
finger
,
"
I
have
a
favor
to
ask
of

"
do
not

Bob

tongue
be
now
evidently
loose
from
its
unwonted
bondage
,
and
may
even
be
in
danger
of
do
more
work
than
be
require
of
it

<EOS>
but
the
subject
on
which
he
long
to
be
inform
be
so
steep
and
difficult
of
approach
,
that
his
tongue
be
likely
to
run
on
along
the
level
rather
than
to
carry
him
on
that
unbeaten
road
.
<EOS>
He
feel
this
,
and
be
silent
again
for
a
little
while
,
ruminate
much
on
the
possible
form
in
which
he
may
put
a
question

<EOS>
at
last
he
say
,
in
a
more
timid
voice
than
usual
,
    
"
Will

leave

further

St.

Passes
judgment
  
<EOS>
It
be
soon
know
throughout
St.
Ogg
's
that
Miss
Tulliver
be
come
back
<EOS>
;
she
have
not
,
then
,
elope
in
order
to
be
marry
to
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
 
at
all
event
,
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
have
not
marry
her
;
which
come
to
the
same
thing
,
so
far
as
her
culpability
be
concern
.
<EOS>
We
judge
other
accord
to
result
;
how
else
?
 
not
know
the
process
by
which
result
be
arrive
at
.
<EOS>
if
Miss
Tulliver
,
after
a
few
month
of
well
-
choose
travel
,
have
return
as
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
,
with
a
post
-
marital
_
trousseau
_
,
and
all
the
advantage
possess
even
by
the
most
unwelcome
wife
of
an
only
son
,
public
opinion
,
which
at
St.
Ogg
's
,
as
else
where
,
always
know
what
to
think
,
would
have
judge
in
strict
consistency
with
those
result
.
<EOS>
public
opinion
,
in
these
case
,
be
always
of
the
feminine
gender
,
 
not
the
world
,
but
the
world
's
wife
;
and
she
would
have
see
that
two
handsome
young
people
 
the
gentleman
of
quite
the
first
family
in
St.
Ogg
's
 
have
find
themselves
in
a
false
position
,
have
be
lead
into
a
course
which
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
be
highly
injudicious
,
and
productive
of
sad
pain
and
disappointment
,
especially
to
that
sweet
young
thing
,
Miss
Deane
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
have
certainly
not
behave
well
;
but
then
,
young
man
be
liable
to
those
sudden
infatuated
attachment
;
and
bad
as
it
may
seem
in
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
to
admit
the
faint
advance
from
her
cousin
's
lover
<EOS>
(
indeed
it
_
have
_
be
say
that
she
be
actually
engage
to
young
Wakem
,
 
old
Wakem
himself
have
mention
it
)
<EOS>
,
still
,
she
be
very
young
,
 
"
and
a
deform
young
man
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
and
young
Guest
so
very
fascinating
<EOS>
;
and
,
they
say
,
he
positively
worship
her
(
to
be
sure
,
that
can
not
last
!
)
,
and
he
run
away
with
her
in
the
boat
quite
against
her
will
,
and
what
could
she
do
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
come
back
then
;
no
one
would
have
speak
to
her
;
and
how
very
well
that
maize
-
color
satinette
become
her
complexion
!
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
the
fold
in
front
be
quite
come
in
;
several
of
her
dress
be
make
so
,
 
they
say
he
think
nothing
too
handsome
to
buy
for
her
.
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Deane
!
<EOS>
She
be
very
pitiable
;
but
then
there
be
no
positive
engagement
;
and
the
air
at
the
coast
will
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
if
young
Guest
feel
no
more
for
her
than
_
that
_
<EOS>
it
be
well
for
her
not
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
what
a
wonderful
marriage
for
a
girl
like
Miss
Tulliver
,
 
quite
romantic
?
<EOS>
why
,
young
Guest
will
put
up
for
the
borough
at
the
next
election
.
<EOS>
nothing
like
commerce
nowadays
!
<EOS>
that
young
Wakem
nearly
go
out
of
his
mind
;
he
always
_
be
_
rather
queer
;
but
he
be
go
abroad
again
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
 
quite
the
good
thing
for
a
deformed
young
man
.
<EOS>
Miss
Unit
declare
she
will
never
visit
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Stephen
Guest
,
 
such
nonsense
!
<EOS>
pretend
to
be
well
than
other
people
.
<EOS>
society
could
not
be
carry
on
if
we
inquire
into
private
conduct
in
that
way
,
 
and
Christianity
tell
us
to
think
no
evil
,
 
and
my
belief
be
,
that
Miss
Unit
have
no
card
send
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
result
,
we
know
,
be
not
of
a
kind
to
warrant
this
extenuation
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
Maggie
have
return
without
a
_
trousseau
_
,
without
a
husband
,
 
in
that
degraded
and
outcast
condition
to
which
error
be
well
known
to
lead
;
and
the
world
's
wife
,
with
that
fine
instinct
which
be
give
her
for
the
preservation
of
Society
,
see
at
once
that
Miss
Tulliver
's
conduct
have
be
of
the
most
aggravated
kind
.
<EOS>
Could
anything
be
more
detestable
?
<EOS>
a
girl
so
much
indebted
to
her
friend
 
whose
mother
as
well
as
herself
have
receive
so
much
kindness
from
the
Deanes
 
to
lay
the
design
of
win
a
young
man
's
affection
away
from
her
own
cousin
,
who
have
behave
like
a
sister
to
her
!
<EOS>
win
his
affection
?
<EOS>
that
be
not
the
phrase
for
such
a
girl
as
Miss
Tulliver
;
it
would
have
be
more
correct
to
say
that
she
have
be
actuate
by
mere
unwomanly
boldness
and
unbridled
passion
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
something
questionable
about
her
.
<EOS>
that
connection
with
young
Wakem
,
which
,
they
say
,
have
be
carry
on
for
year
,
look
very
ill
,
 
disgusting
,
in
fact
!
<EOS>
but
with
a
girl
of
that
disposition
!
<EOS>
to
the
world
's
wife
there
have
always
be
something
in
Miss
Tulliver
<EOS>
's
very
_
physique
_
that
a
refined
instinct
feel
to
be
prophetic
of
harm
.
<EOS>
as
for
poor
Mr.
Stephen
Guest
,
he
be
rather
pitiable
than
otherwise
;
a
young
man
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
be
not
to
be
too
severely
judge
in
these
case
,
 
<EOS>
he
be
really
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
a
designing
,
bold
girl
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
clear
that
he
have
give
way
in
spite
of
himself
:
he
have
shake
her
off
as
soon
as
he
could
;
indeed
,
their
have
part
so
soon
look
very
black
indeed
 
_
for
her
_
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
he
have
write
a
letter
,
lay
all
the
blame
on
himself
,
and
tell
the
story
in
a
romantic
fashion
so
as
to
try
and
make
her
appear
quite
innocent
;
of
course
he
would
do
that
!
<EOS>
but
the
refined
instinct
of
the
world
's
wife
be
not
to
be
deceive
;
providentially
!
 
<EOS>
else
what
would
become
of
Society
?
<EOS>
why
,
her
own
brother
have
turn
her
from
his
door
;
he
have
see
enough
,
you
may
be
sure
,
before
he
would
do
that
.
<EOS>
a
truly
respectable
young
man
,
Mr.
Tom
Tulliver
;
quite
likely
to
rise
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
His
sister
's
disgrace
be
naturally
a
heavy
blow
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
hope
that
she
would
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
,
 
to
America
,
or
anywhere
,
 
so
as
to
purify
the
air
of
St.
Ogg
be
from
the
stain
of
her
presence
,
extremely
dangerous
to
daughter
there
!
<EOS>
no
good
could
happen
to
her
;
it
be
only
to
be
hope
she
would
repent
,
and
that
God
would
have
mercy
on
her
:
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
care
of
society
on
His
hand
,
as
the
world
's
wife
have
.
  
<EOS>
It
require
nearly
a
fortnight
for
fine
instinct
to
assure
itself
of
these
inspiration
;
indeed
,
it
be
a
whole
week
before
Stephen
's
letter
come
,
tell
his
father
the
fact
,
and
add
that
he
be
go
across
to
Holland
,
 
have
draw
upon
the
agent
at
Mudport
for
money
,
 
be
incapable
of
any
resolution
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
,
all
this
while
,
be
too
entirely
fill
with
a
more
agonizing
anxiety
to
spend
any
thought
on
the
view
that
be
be
take
of
her
conduct
by
the
world
of
St.
Ogg
's
;
anxiety
about
Stephen
,
Lucy
,
Philip
,
beat
on
her
poor
heart
in
a
hard
,
drive
,
ceaseless
storm
of
mingled
love
,
remorse
,
and
pity
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
think
of
rejection
and
injustice
at
all
,
it
would
have
seem
to
her
that
they
have
do
their
bad
;
that
she
could
hardly
feel
any
stroke
from
them
intolerable
since
the
word
she
have
hear
from
her
brother
's
lip
.
<EOS>
across
all
her
anxiety
for
the
love
and
the
injure
,
those
word
shoot
again
and
again
,
like
a
horrible
pang
that
would
have
bring
misery
and
dread
even
into
a
heaven
of
delight
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
ever
recover
happiness
never
glimmer
in
her
mind
for
a
moment
;
it
seem
as
if
every
sensitive
fibre
in
her
be
too
entirely
preoccupy
by
pain
ever
to
vibrate
again
to
another
influence
.
<EOS>
life
stretch
before
her
as
one
act
of
penitence
;
and
all
she
crave
,
as
she
dwell
on
her
future
lot
,
be
something
to
guarantee
her
from
more
fall
;
her
own
weakness
haunt
her
like
a
vision
of
hideous
possibility
,
that
make
no
peace
conceivable
except
such
as
lie
in
the
sense
of
a
sure
refuge
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
without
practical
intention
;
the
love
of
independence
be
too
strong
an
inheritance
and
a
habit
for
her
not
to
remember
that
she
must
get
her
bread
;
and
when
other
project
look
vague
,
she
fall
back
on
that
of
return
to
her
plain
sewing
,
and
so
get
enough
to
pay
for
her
lodging
at
Bob
's
.
<EOS>
She
mean
to
persuade
her
mother
to
return
to
the
Mill
by
and
by
,
and
live
with
Tom
again
;
and
somehow
or
other
she
would
maintain
herself
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
would
perhaps
help
her
and
advise
her
.
<EOS>
She
remember
his
parting
word
at
the
bazaar
.
<EOS>
She
remember
the
momentary
feeling
of
reliance
that
have
spring
in
her
when
he
be
talk
with
her
,
and
she
wait
with
yearning
expectation
for
the
opportunity
of
confide
everything
to
him
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
call
every
day
at
Mr.
Deane
's
to
learn
how
Lucy
be
;
the
report
be
always
sad
,
 
nothing
have
yet
rouse
her
from
the
feeble
passivity
which
have
come
on
with
the
first
shock
.
<EOS>
but
of
Philip
,
Mrs.
Tulliver
have
learn
nothing
;
naturally
,
no
one
whom
she
meet
would
speak
to
her
about
what
relate
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
she
summon
courage
to
go
and
see
sister
Glegg
,
who
of
course
would
know
everything
,
and
have
be
even
to
see
Tom
at
the
Mill
in
Mrs.
Tulliver
's
absence
,
though
he
have
say
nothing
of
what
have
pass
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
her
mother
be
go
,
Maggie
put
on
her
bonnet
.
<EOS>
She
have
resolve
on
walk
to
the
Rectory
and
ask
to
see
Dr.
Kenn
;
he
be
in
deep
grief
,
but
the
grief
of
another
do
not
jar
upon
us
in
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
she
have
be
beyond
the
door
since
her
return
;
nevertheless
her
mind
be
so
bent
on
the
purpose
of
her
walk
,
that
the
unpleasantness
of
meet
people
on
the
way
,
and
be
stare
at
,
do
not
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
no
sooner
pass
beyond
the
narrow
street
which
she
have
to
thread
from
Bob
's
dwelling
,
than
she
become
aware
of
unusual
glance
cast
at
her
;
and
this
consciousness
make
her
hurry
along
nervously
,
afraid
to
look
to
right
or
leave
.
<EOS>
presently
,
however
,
she
come
full
on
Mrs.
and
Miss
Turnbull
,
old
acquaintance
of
her
family
;
they
both
look
at
her
strangely
,
and
turn
a
little
aside
without
speak
.
<EOS>
all
hard
look
be
pain
to
Maggie
,
but
her
self
-
reproach
be
too
strong
for
resentment
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
they
will
not
speak
to
me
<EOS>
,
she
think
;
they
be
very
fond
of
Lucy
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
know
that
she
be
about
to
pass
a
group
of
gentleman
,
who
be
stand
at
the
door
of
the
billiard
-
room
,
and
she
could
not
help
see
young
Torry
step
out
a
little
with
his
glass
at
his
eye
,
and
bow
to
her
with
that
air
of
_
nonchalance
_
which
he
may
have
bestow
on
a
friendly
barmaid
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
's
pride
be
too
intense
for
her
not
to
feel
that
sting
,
even
in
the
midst
of
her
sorrow
;
and
for
the
first
time
the
thought
take
strong
hold
of
her
that
she
would
have
other
obloquy
cast
on
her
besides
that
which
be
feel
to
be
due
to
her
breach
of
faith
toward
Lucy
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
at
the
Rectory
now
;
there
,
perhaps
,
she
would
find
something
else
than
retribution
.
<EOS>
retribution
may
come
from
any
voice
;
the
hard
,
cruel
,
most
imbrute
urchin
at
the
street
-
corner
can
inflict
it
;
surely
help
and
pity
be
rare
thing
,
more
needful
for
the
righteous
to
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
show
up
at
once
,
after
be
announce
,
into
Dr.
Kenn
's
study
,
where
he
sit
amongst
pile
-
up
book
,
for
which
he
have
little
appetite
,
lean
his
cheek
against
the
head
of
his
young
child
,
a
girl
of
three
.
<EOS>
the
child
be
send
away
with
the
servant
,
and
when
the
door
be
close
,
Dr.
Kenn
say
,
place
a
chair
for
Maggie
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
see
you
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
you
have
anticipate
me
;
I
be
glad
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
look
at
him
with
her
childlike
directness
as
she
have
do
at
the
bazaar
,
and
say
,
"
I
want
to
tell
you
everything
.
"
<EOS>
but
her
eye
fill
fast
with
tear
as
she
say
it
,
and
all
the
pen
-
up
excitement
of
her
humiliating
walk
would
have
its
vent
before
she
could
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
tell
me
everything
,
"
Dr.
Kenn
say
,
with
quiet
kindness
in
his
grave
,
firm
voice
.
"
<EOS>
think
of
me
as
one
to
whom
a
long
experience
have
be
grant
,
which
may
enable
him
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
rather
broken
sentence
,
and
with
some
effort
at
first
,
but
soon
with
the
great
ease
that
come
from
a
sense
of
relief
in
the
confidence
,
Maggie
tell
the
brief
story
of
a
struggle
that
must
be
the
beginning
of
a
long
sorrow
.
<EOS>
only
the
day
before
,
Dr.
Kenn
have
be
make
acquaint
with
the
content
of
Stephen
's
letter
,
and
he
have
believe
them
at
once
,
without
the
confirmation
of
Maggie
's
statement
.
<EOS>
that
involuntary
plaint
of
hers
,
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
oh
,
I
must
go
_
,
"
have
remain
with
him
as
the
sign
that
she
be
undergo
some
inward
conflict
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
dwell
the
long
on
the
feeling
which
have
make
her
come
back
to
her
mother
and
brother
,
which
make
her
cle
to
all
the
memory
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
end
,
Dr.
Kenn
be
silent
for
some
minute
;
there
be
a
difficulty
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
walk
up
and
down
the
hearth
with
his
hand
behind
him
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
seat
himself
again
,
and
say
,
look
at
Maggie
,
    
"
Your
prompting
to
go
to
your
near
friend
,
 
to
remain
where
all
the
tie
of
your
life
have
be
form
,
 
be
a
true
prompting
,
to
which
the
Church
in
its
original
constitution
and
discipline
respond
,
open
its
arm
to
the
penitent
,
watch
over
its
child
to
the
last
;
never
abandon
them
until
they
be
hopelessly
reprobate
.
<EOS>
and
the
Church
ought
to
represent
the
feeling
of
the
community
,
so
that
every
parish
should
be
a
family
knit
together
by
christian
brotherhood
under
a
spiritual
father
.
<EOS>
but
the
idea
of
discipline
and
christian
fraternity
be
entirely
relaxed
,
 
they
can
hardly
be
say
to
exist
in
the
public
mind
;
they
hardly
survive
except
in
the
partial
,
contradictory
form
they
have
take
in
the
narrow
community
of
schismatic
;
and
if
I
be
not
support
by
the
firm
faith
that
the
Church
must
ultimately
recover
the
full
force
of
that
constitution
which
be
alone
fit
to
human
need
,
I
should
often
lose
heart
at
observe
the
want
of
fellowship
and
sense
of
mutual
responsibility
among
my
own
flock
.
<EOS>
at
present
everything
seem
tend
toward
the
relaxation
of
tie
,
 
toward
the
substitution
of
wayward
choice
for
the
adherence
to
obligation
,
which
have
its
root
in
the
past
.
<EOS>
Your
conscience
and
your
heart
have
give
you
true
light
on
this
point
,
Miss
Tulliver
;
and
I
have
say
all
this
that
you
may
know
what
my
wish
about
you
 
what
my
advice
to
you
 
would
be
,
if
they
spring
from
my
own
feeling

opinion
unmodifie
by
counteract
circumstance

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
pause
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
entire
absence
of
effusive
benevolence
in
his
manner
;
there
be
something
almost
cold
in
the
gravity
of
his
look
and
voice
.
<EOS>
if
Maggie
have
not
know
that
his
benevolence
be
persevere
in
proportion
to
its
reserve
,
she
may
have
be
chill
and
frightened
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
listen
expectantly
,
quite
sure
that
there
would
be
some
effective
help
in
his
word
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
inexperience
of
the
world
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
prevent
you
from
anticipate
fully
the
very
unjust
conception
that
will
probably
be
form
concern
your
conduct
,
 
conception
which
will
have
a
baneful
effect

even
in

them

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

I
do

I

Maggie

unable

this
utterance

her
recent
pain

You

say
Dr.

with
a
touch
of
more
personal
pity

that
a
letter
be
come
which
ought

satisfy
every

"

poor

no

have
hinder

He
be
go
abroad

he

write

He
have
vindicate
you
to
the

I
hope
the
communication

that

have
a
beneficial
effect

<EOS>
Dr.

wait
for
her
to
get
calm
again
before
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
letter
,
as
I
say
,
ought
to
suffice
to
prevent
false
impression
concern
you

<EOS>
but
I
be
bind
to
tell
you
,
Miss
Tulliver
,
that
not
only
the
experience
of
my
whole
life
,
but
my
observation
within
the
last
three
day
,
make
me
fear
that
there
be
hardly
any
evidence
which
will
save
you
from
the
painful
effect
of
false
imputation

<EOS>
the
person
who
be
the
most
incapable
of
a
conscientious
struggle
such
as
your
be
precisely
those
who
will
be
likely
to
shrink
from
you
,
because
they
will
not
believe
in
your
struggle

<EOS>
I
fear
your
life
here
will
be
attend
not
only
with
much
pain
,
but
with
many
obstruction

<EOS>
for
this
reason
 
and
for
this
only
 
I
ask
you
to
consider
whether
it
will
not
perhaps
be
well
for
you
to
take
a
situation
at
a
distance
,
accord
to
your
former
intention

<EOS>
I
will
exert
myself
at
once
to
obtain
one
for
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
if
I
could
but
stop
here
!
"
say
Maggie

<EOS>
"
I
have
no

begin
a
strange
life
again

<EOS>
I
should

no

<EOS>
I
should
feel

cut
off

<EOS>
I
have
write
to
the
lady
who
offer
me
a
situation
to
excuse
myself

<EOS>
if
I
remain
here
,
I
could
perhaps
atone
in
some
way
to
Lucy
 
to

I

convince

false

I

Maggie

<EOS>
I
can
go
on
lodging

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
think
over
the
subject
maturely
,
"

Dr.
Kenn
,
"
and
in
a
few
day
I
shall
be
better
able
to
ascertain
the
general
feeling

<EOS>
I
shall
come
to
see
you
;
I
shall
bear
you
constantly
in

"
  
<EOS>
when
Maggie
have
leave
him
,
Dr.
Kenn
stand
ruminate
with
his
hand
behind
him
,
and
his
eye
fix
on
the
carpet
,
under
a
painful
sense
of
doubt
and
difficulty
.
<EOS>
the
tone
of
Stephen
's
letter
,
which
he
have
read
,
and
the
actual
relation
of
all
the
person
concern
,
force
upon
him
powerfully
the
idea
of
an
ultimate
marriage
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
as
the
least
evil
;
and
the
impossibility
of
their
proximity
in
St.
Ogg
be
on
any
other
supposition
,
until
after
year
of
separation
,
throw
an
insurmountable
prospective
difficulty
over
Maggie
's
stay
there
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
enter
with
all
the
comprehension
of
a
man
who
have
know
spiritual
conflict
,
and
live
through
year
of
devoted
service
to
his
fellow
-
man
,
into
that
state
of
Maggie
's
heart
and
conscience
which
make
the
consent
to
the
marriage
a
desecration
to
her
;
her
conscience
must
not
be
tamper
with
;
the
principle
on
which
she
have
act
be
a
safe
guide
than
any
balancing
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
His
experience
tell
him
that
intervention
be
too
dubious
a
responsibility
to
be
lightly
incur
;
the
possible
issue
either
of
an
endeavor
to
restore
the
former
relation
with
Lucy
and
Philip
,
or
of
counsel
submission
to
this
irruption
of
a
new
feeling
,
be
hide
in
a
darkness
all
the
more
impenetrable
because
each
immediate
step
be
clog
with
evil
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
problem
of
the
shift
relation
between
passion
and
duty
be
clear
to
no
man
who
be
capable
of
apprehend
it
;
the
question
whether
the
moment
have
come
in
which
a
man
have
fall
below
the
possibility
of
a
renunciation
that
will
carry
any
efficacy
,
and
must
accept
the
sway
of
a
passion
against
which
he
have
struggle
as
a
trespass
,
be
one
for
which
we
have
no
master
-
key
that
will
fit
all
case
.
<EOS>
the
casuist
have
become
a
byword
of
reproach
;
but
their
perverted
spirit
of
minute
discrimination
be
the
shadow
of
a
truth
to
which
eye
and
heart
be
too
often
fatally
seal
,
 
the
truth
,
that
moral
judgment
must
remain
false
and
hollow
,
unless
they
be
check
and
enlighten
by
a
perpetual
reference
to
the
special
circumstance
that
mark
the
individual
lot
.
  
<EOS>
all
people
of
broad
,
strong
sense
have
an
instinctive
repugnance
to
the
man
of
maxim
;
because
such
people
early
discern
that
the
mysterious
complexity
of
our
life
be
not
to
be
embrace
by
maxim
,
and
that
to
lace
ourselves
up
in
formula
of
that
sort
be
to
repress
all
the
divine
prompting
and
inspiration
that
spring
from
grow
insight
and
sympathy

<EOS>
and
the
man
of
maxims
be
the
popular
representative
of
the
mind
that
be
guide
in
their
moral
judgment
solely
by
general
rule
,
think
that
these
will
lead
them
to
justice
by
a
ready

patent
method
,
without
the
trouble
of
exert
patience

without
any
care
to
assure
themselves
whether
they
have
the
insight
that
come
from
a
hardly
earn
estimate
of
temptation
,
or
from
a
life
vivid
and
intense
enough
to
have
create
a

<EOS>
show
that
Old
acquaintance
be
capable

Us
  
<EOS>
when
Maggie
be
at
home
again
,
her
mother
bring
her
news
of
an
unexpected
line
of
conduct
in
aunt
Glegg
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
Maggie
have
not
be
hear
of
,
Mrs.
Glegg
have
half
close
her
shutter
and
draw
down
her
blind
.
<EOS>
She
feel
assure
that
Maggie
be
drown
;
that
be
far
more
probable
than
that
her
niece
and
legatee
should
have
do
anything
to
wound
the
family
honor
in
the
tender
point
.
<EOS>
when
at

she
learn
from
Tom
that
Maggie
have
come
home
,
and
gather
from
him
what
be
her
explanation
of
her
absence
,
she
burst
forth
in
severe
reproof
of
Tom
for
admit
the
bad
of
his
sister
until
he
be
compel

<EOS>
if
you
be
not
to
stand
by
your

kin
"
as
long
as
there
be
a
shred
of
honor
attributable
to
them
,
pray
what
be
you
to
stand
by
?
<EOS>
lightly
to
admit
conduct
in
one
of
your
own
family
that
would
force
you
to
alter
your
will
,
have
never
be
the
way
of
the
Dodsons
;
and
though
Mrs.
Glegg
have
always
augur
ill
of
Maggie
's
future
at
a
time
when
other
people
be
perhaps
less
clear
-
sighted
,
yet
fair
play
be
a
jewel
,
and
it
be
not
for
her
own
friend
to
help
to
rob
the
girl
of
her
fair
fame
,
and
to
cast
her
out
from
family
shelter
to
the
scorn
of
the
outer
world
,
until
she
have
become
unequivocally
a
family
disgrace
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
be
unprecedented
in
Mrs.
Glegg
's
experience
;
nothing
of
that
kind
have
happen
among
the
Dodsons
before
;
but
it
be
a
case
in
which
her
hereditary
rectitude
and
personal
strength
of
character
find
a
common
channel
along
with
her
fundamental
idea
of
clanship
,
as
they
do
in
her
lifelong
regard
to
equity
in
money
matter
.
<EOS>
She
quarrel
with
Mr.
Glegg
,
whose
kindness
,
flow
entirely
into
compassion
for
Lucy
,
make
him
as
hard
in
his
judgment
of
Maggie
as
Mr.
Deane
himself
be
;
and
fume
against
her
sister
Tulliver
because
she
do
not
at
once
come
to
her
for
advice
and
help
,
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
room
with
Baxter
's
"
saint

rest
"
from
morning
till
night
,
deny
herself
to
all
visitor
,
till
Mr.
Glegg
bring
from
Mr.
Deane
the
news
of
Stephen
's
letter
.
<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Glegg
feel
that
she
have
adequate
fighting

ground
;
then
she
lay
aside
Baxter
,
and
be
ready
to
meet
all
comer
.
<EOS>
while
Mrs.
Pullet
could
do
nothing
but
shake
her
head
and
cry
,
and
wish
that
cousin
Abbot
have
die
,
or
any
number
of
funeral
have
happen
rather
than
this
,
which
have
never
happen
before
,
so
that
there
be
no
know
how
to
act
,
and
Mrs.
Pullet
could
never
enter
St.
Ogg
be
again
,
because
"
acquaintance
"
know
of
it
all
,
Mrs.
Glegg
only
hope
that
Mrs.
Wooll
,
or
any
one
else
,
would
come
to
her
with
their
false
tale
about
her
own
niece
,
and
she
would
know
what
to
say
to
that
ill
-
advise
person
!
  
<EOS>
again
she
have
a
scene
of
remonstrance
with
Tom
,
all
the
more
severe
in
proportion
to
the
great
strength
of
her
present
position
.
<EOS>
but
Tom
,
like
other
immovable
thing
,
seem
only
the
more
rigidly
fix
under
that
attempt
to
shake
him
.
<EOS>
poor
Tom
!
<EOS>
he
judge
by
what
he
have
be
able
to
see
;
and
the
judgment
be
painful
enough
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
think
he
have
the
demonstration
of
fact
observe
through
year
by
his
own
eye
,
which
give
no
warning
of
their
imperfection
,
that
Maggie
's
nature
be
utterly
untrustworthy
,
and
too
strongly
marked
with
evil
tendency
to
be
safely
treat
with
leniency
.
<EOS>
He
would
act
on
that
demonstration
at
any
cost
;
but
the
thought
of
it
make
his
day
bitter
to
him
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
like
every
one
of
us
,
be
imprison
within
the
limit
of
his
own
nature
,
and
his
education
have
simply

over
him

leave
a

deposit
of
polish
;
if
you
be

to
be
severe
on
his
severity

remember
that
the
responsibility
of
tolerance
lie
with
those
who
have
the
wide
vision

<EOS>
there
have
arise
in
Tom
a
repulsion
toward
Maggie
that
derive
its
very
intensity
from
their
early
childish
love
in
the
time
when
they
have
clasp
tiny
finger
together
,
and
their
later
sense
of
nearness
in
a
common
duty
and
a
common
sorrow
;
the
sight
of
her
,
as
he
have
tell
her
,
be
hateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
in
this
branch
of
the
Dodson
family
aunt
Glegg
find
a
strong
nature
than
her
own
;
a
nature
in
which
family
feeling
have
lose
the
character
of
clanship
by
take
on
a
doubly
deep
dye
of
personal
pride
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glegg
allow
that
Maggie
ought
to
be
punish
,
 
she
be
not
a
woman
to
deny
that
;
she
know
what
conduct
be
,
 
but
punish
in
proportion
to
the
misdeed
prove
against
her
,
not
to
those
which
be
cast
upon
her
by
people
outside
her
own
family
who
may
wish
to
show
that
their
own
kin
be
well

still
two

three
more

pass
,

Maggie
hear
nothing
of
Philip

anxiety
about
him
be
become
her
predominant
trouble

and
she
summon
courage
at
last
to
inquire
about
him
of
Dr.
Kenn
,
on
his
next
visit
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
even
know
if
Philip

<EOS>
the
elder
Wakem
be
make
moody
by
an
accumulation
of
annoyance
;
the
disappointment
in
this
young
Jetsome
,
to
whom
,
apparently
,
he
be
a
good
deal
attach
,
have
be
follow
close
by
the
catastrophe
to
his
son
's
hope
after
he
have
do
violence
to
his
own
strong
feeling
by
concede
to
them
,
and
have
incautiously
mention
this
concession
in
St.
Ogg
's
;
and
he
be
almost
fierce
in
his
brusqueness
when
any
one
ask
him
a
question
about
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
but
Philip
could
hardly
have
be
ill
,
or
it
would
have
be
know
through
the
calling
in
of
the
medical
man

it
be
probable
that
he
be
go
out
of
the
town
for
a
little
while

<EOS>
Maggie
sicken
under
this
suspense
,

her
imagination
begin
to
live
more
and
more
persistently
in
what
Philip

endure

<EOS>
what
do
he
believe
about
her
?
  
<EOS>
at
last
Bob
bring
her
a
letter
,
without
a
postmark
,
direct
in
a
hand
which
she
know
familiarly
in
the
letter

her

a
hand
in
which

in

Her
mother
be
in
the
room
,
and
Maggie
,
in
violent
agitation

hurry
upstairs
that
she
may
read
the
letter
in
solitude

She
read
it
with

"
Maggie
,
 
<EOS>
I
believe
in
you
;
I
know
you
never
mean
to
deceive
me
;
I
  
know
you
try
to
keep
faith
to
me
and
to
all
.
<EOS>
I
believe
this
  
before
I
have
any
other
evidence
of
it
than
your
own
nature
.
<EOS>
the
  
night
after
I
last
part
from
you
I
suffer
torment
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
  
what
convince
me
that
you
be
not
free
;
that
there
be
another
  
whose
presence
have
a
power
over
you
which
mine
never
possess
;
but
  
through
all
the
suggestion
 
almost
murderous
suggestion
 
of
rage
  
and
jealousy
,
my
mind
make
its
way
to
believe
in
your
truthfulness
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
you
mean
to
cleave
to
me
,
as
you
have
say
;
that
  
you
have
reject
him
;
that
you
struggle
to
renounce
him
,
for
  
Lucy
's
sake
and
for
mine
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
see
no
issue
that
be
not
  
fatal
for
_
you
;
<EOS>
_
and
that
dread
shut
out
the
very
thought
of
  
resignation
.
<EOS>
I
foresaw
that
he
would
not
relinquish
you
,
and
I
  
believe
then
,
as
I
believe
now
,
that
the
strong
attraction
which
  
draw
you
together
proceed
only
from
one
side
of
your
character
,
  
and
belong
to
that
partial
,
divided
action
of
our
nature
which
  
make
half
the
tragedy
of
the
human
lot
.
<EOS>
I
have
feel
the
vibration
  
of
chord
in
your
nature
that
I
have
continually
feel
the
want
of
  
in
his
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
I
be
wrong
;
perhaps
I
feel
about
you
as
the
  
artist
do
about
the
scene
over
which
his
soul
have
brood
with
  
love
;
he
would
tremble
to
see
it
confide
to
other
hand
;
he
would
  
never
believe
that
it
could
bear
for
another
all
the
meaning
and
  
the
beauty
it
bear
for
him
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
trust
myself
to
see
you
that
morning

I
be
fill
  
with
selfish
passion
;
I
be
shatter
by
a
night
of
conscious
  
delirium

<EOS>
I
tell
you
long
ago
that
I
have
never
be
resign
even
  
to
the
mediocrity
of
my
power

how
could
I
be
resign
to
the
loss
  
of
the
one
thing
which
have
ever
come
to
me
on
earth

the
  
promise
of
such
deep
joy

would
give
a
new

everything

terrible
throe

suffer

in
the

could
not

to
  
come
like
a
death

shadow
across
the
feast

your
joy

<EOS>
I
could
not
  
bear
to
forsake
the

<EOS>
as
Maggie
knelt
by
the
bed
sob
,
with
that
letter
press
under
her
,
her
feeling
again
and
again
gather
themselves
in
a
whisper
cry
,
always
in
the
same
word
,
    
"
o
God

be
there
any

could

"
    
Maggie
and
Lucy
  
<EOS>
by
the
end
of
the
week
Dr.
Kenn
have
make
up
his
mind
that
there
be
only
one
way
in
which
he
could
secure
to
Maggie
a
suitable
living
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
even
with
his
twenty
year
'
experience
as
a
parish
priest
,
he
be
aghast
at
the
obstinate
continuance
of
imputation
against
her
in
the
face
of
evidence
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
he
have
be
rather
more
adored
and
appeal
to
than
be
quite
agreeable
to
him
;
but
now
,
in
attempt
to
open
the
ear
of
woman
to
reason
,
and
their
conscience
to
justice
,
on
behalf
of
Maggie
Tulliver
,
he
suddenly
find
himself
as
powerless
as
he
be
aware
he
would
have
be
if
he
have
attempt
to
influence
the
shape
of
bonnet
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
could
not
be
contradict
;
he
be
listen
to
in
silence
;
but
when
he
leave
the
room
,
a
comparison
of
opinion
among
his
hearer
yield
much
the
same
result
as
before
.
<EOS>
Miss
Tulliver
have
undeniably
act
in
a
blamable
manner
,
even
Dr.
Kenn
do
not
deny
that
;
how
,
then
,
could
he
think
so
lightly
of
her
as
to
put
that
favorable
interpretation
on
everything
she
have
do
?
<EOS>
even
on
the
supposition
that
require
the
utmost
stretch
of
belief
,
 
namely
,
that
none
of
the
thing
say
about
Miss
Tulliver
be
true
,
 
still
,
since
they
_
have
_
be
say
about
her
,
they
have
cast
an
odor
round
her
which
must
cause
her
to
be
shrink
from
by
every
woman
who
have
to
take
care
of
her
own
reputation
 
and
of
Society
.
<EOS>
to
have
take
Maggie
by
the
hand
and
say
,
"
I
will
not
believe
unproved
evil
of
you
;
my
lip
shall
not
utter
it
;
my
ear
shall
be
close
against
it
;
I
,
too
,
be
an
err
mortal
,
liable
to
stumble
,
apt
to
come
short
of
my
most
earnest
effort
;
your
lot
have
be
hard
than
mine
,
your
temptation
great
<EOS>
;
let
us
help
each
other
to
stand
and
walk
without
more
fall
,
"
 
to
have
do
this
would
have
demand
courage
,
deep
pity
,
self
-
knowledge
,
generous
trust
;
would
have
demand
a
mind
that
taste
no
piquancy
in
evil
-
speak
,
that
feel
no
self
-
exaltation
in
condemning
,
that
cheat
itself
with
no
large
word
into
the
belief
that
life
can
have
any
moral
end
,
any
high
religion
,
which
exclude
the
striving
after
perfect
truth
,
justice
,
and
love
toward
the
individual
man
and
woman
who
come
across
our
own
path
.
<EOS>
the
lady
of
St.
Ogg
's
be
not
beguile
by
any
wide
speculative
conception
;
but
they
have
their
favorite
abstraction
,
call
Society
,
which
serve
to
make
their
conscience
perfectly
easy
in
do
what
satisfy
their
own
egoism
,
 
think
and
speak
the
bad
of
Maggie
Tulliver
,
and
turn
their
back
upon
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
naturally
disappointing
to
Dr.
Kenn
,
after
two
year
of
superfluous
incense
from
his
feminine
parishioner
,
to
find
them
suddenly
maintain
their
view
in
opposition
to
his
;
but
then
they
maintain
them
in
opposition
to
a
high
Authority
,
which
they
have
venerate
longer
.
<EOS>
that
Authority
have
furnish
a
very
explicit
answer
to
person
who
may
inquire
where
their
social
duty
begin
,
and
may
be
incline
to
take
wide
view
as
to
the
starting
-
point
.
<EOS>
the
answer
have
not
turn
on
the
ultimate
good
of
Society
,
but
on
"
a
certain
man
"
who
be
find
in
trouble
by
the
wayside
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
St.
Ogg
's
be
empty
of
woman
with
some
tenderness
of
heart
and
conscience
;
probably
it
have
as
fair
<EOS>
a
proportion
of
human
goodness
in
it
as
any
other
small
trading
town
of
that
day
.
<EOS>
but
until
every
good
man
be
brave
,
we
must
expect
to
find
many
good
woman
timid
,
 
too
timid
even
to
believe
in
the
correctness
of
their
own
good
prompting
,
when
these
would
place
them
in
a
minority
.
<EOS>
and
the
man
at
St.
Ogg
's
be
not
all
brave
,
by
any
mean
;
some
of
them
be
even
fond
of
scandal
,
and
to
an
extent
that
may
have
give
their
conversation
an
effeminate
character
,
if
it
have
not
be
distinguish
by
masculine
joke
,
and
by
an
occasional
shrug
of
the
shoulder
at
the
mutual
hatred
of
woman
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
general
feeling
of
the
masculine
mind
at
St.
Ogg
be
that
woman
be
not
to
be
interfere
with
in
their
treatment
of
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
every
direction
in
which
Dr.
Kenn
have
turn
,
in
the
hope
of
procure
some
kind
recognition
and
some
employment
for
Maggie
,
prove
a
disappointment
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
James
Torry
could
not
think
of
take
Maggie
as
a
nursery
governess
,
even
temporarily
,
 
a
young
woman
about
whom
"
such
thing
have
be
say
,
"
and
about
whom
"
gentleman
joke
"
;
and
Miss
Kirke
,
who
have
a
spinal
complaint
,
and
want
a
reader
and
companion
,
feel
quite
sure
that
Maggie
's
mind
must
be
of
a
quality
with
which
she
,
for
her
part
,
could
not
risk
_
any
_
contact
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
Miss
Tulliver
accept
the
shelter
offer
her
by
her
aunt
Glegg
?
<EOS>
It
do
not
become
a
girl
like
her
to
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
or
else
,
why
do
she
not
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
,
and
get
a
situation
where
she
be
not
know
?
<EOS>
(
It
be
not
,
apparently
,
of
so
much
importance
that
she
should
carry
her
dangerous
tendency
into
strange
family
unknown
at
St.
Ogg
's
.
)
<EOS>
She
must
be
very
bold
and
harden
to
wish
to
stay
in
a
parish
where
she
be
so
much
stare
at
and
whisper
about
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
,
have
great
natural
firmness
,
begin
,
in
the
presence
of
this
opposition
,
as
every
firm
man
would
have
do
,
to
contract
a
certain
strength
of
determination
over
and
above
what
would
have
be
call
forth
by
the
end
in
view
.
<EOS>
He
himself
want
a
daily
governess
for
his
young
child
;
and
though
he
have
hesitate
in
the
first
instance
to
offer
this
position
to
Maggie
,
the
resolution
to
protest
with
the
utmost
force
of
his
personal
and
priestly
character
against
her
be
crush
and
drive
away
by
slander
,
be
now
decisive
.
<EOS>
Maggie
gratefully
accept
an
employment
that
give
her
duty
as
well
as
a
support
;
her
day
would
be
fill
now
,
and
solitary
evening
would
be
a
welcome
rest
.
<EOS>
She
no
longer
need
the
sacrifice
her
mother
make
in
stay
with
her
,
and
Mrs.
Tulliver
be
persuade
to
go
back
to
the
Mill
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
it
begin
to
be
discover
that
Dr.
Kenn
,
exemplary
as
he
have
hitherto
appear
,
have
his
crotchet
,
possibly
his
weakness
.
<EOS>
the
masculine
mind
of
St.
Ogg
's
smile
pleasantly
,
and
do
not
wonder
that
Kenn
like
to
see
a
fine
pair
of
eye
daily
,
or
that
he
be
inclined
to
take
so
lenient
a
view
of
the
past
;
the
feminine
mind
,
regard
at
that
period
as
less
powerful
,
take
a
more
melancholy
view
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
if
Dr.
Kenn
should
be
beguile
into
marry
that
Miss
Tulliver
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
safe
to
be
too
confident
,
even
about
the
good
of
man
;
an
apostle
have
fall
,
and
weep
bitterly
afterwards
;
and
though
Peter
's
denial
be
not
a
close
precedent
,
his
repentance
be
likely
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
have
not
take
her
daily
walk
to
the
Rectory
for
many
week
,
before
the
dreadful
possibility
of
her
some
time
or
other
become
the
rector
's
wife
have
be
talk
of
so
often
in
confidence
,
that
lady
be
begin
to
discuss
how
they
should
behave
to
her
in
that
position
.
<EOS>
for
Dr.
Kenn
,
it
have
be
understand
,
have
sit
in
the
schoolroom
half
an
hour
one
morning
,
when
Miss
Tulliver
be
give
her
lesson
,
 
nay
,
he
have
sit
there
every
morning
;
he
have
once
walk
home
with
her
,
 
he
<EOS>
almost
_
<EOS>
always
_
walk
home
with
her
,
 
and
if
not
,
he
go
to
see
her
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
what
an
artful
creature
she
be
!
<EOS>
what
a
_
mother
_
for
those
child
!
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
make
poor
Mrs.
Kenn
turn
in
her
grave
,
that
they
should
be
put
under
the
care
of
this
girl
only
a
few
week
after
her
death
.
<EOS>
Would
he
be
so
lose
to
propriety
as
to
marry
her
before
the
year
be
out
?
<EOS>
the
masculine
mind
be
sarcastic
,
and
think
_
not
_
.
  
<EOS>
the
Miss
Guests
see
an
alleviation
to
the
sorrow
of
witness
a
folly
in
their
rector
;
at
least
their
brother
would
be
safe
;
and
their
knowledge
of
Stephen
's
tenacity
be
a
constant
ground
of
alarm
to
them
,
lest
he
should
come
back
and
marry
Maggie
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
among
those
who
disbelieve
their
brother
's
letter
;
but
they
have
no
confidence
in
Maggie
's
adherence
to
her
renunciation
of
him
;
they
suspect
that
she
have
shrink
rather
from
the
elopement
than
from
the
marriage
,
and
that
she
linger
in
St.
Ogg
's
,
rely
on
his
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
They
have
always
think
her
disagreeable
;
they
now
think
her
artful
and
proud
;
have
quite
as
good
ground
for
that
judgment
as
you
and
I
probably
have
for
many
strong
opinion
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
formerly
they
have
not
altogether
delighted
in
the
contemplate
match
with
Lucy
,
but
now
their
dread
of
a
marriage
between
Stephen
and
Maggie
add
its
momentum
to
their
genuine
pity
and
indignation
on
behalf
of
the
gentle
forsaken
girl
,
in
make
them
desire
that
he
should
return
to
her
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Lucy
be
able
to
leave
home
,
she
be
to
seek
relief
from
the
oppressive
heat
of
this
August
by
go
to
the
coast
with
the
Miss
Guests
;
and
it
be
in
their
plan
that
Stephen
should
be
induce
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
on
the
very
first
hint
of
gossip
concern
Maggie
and
Dr.
Kenn
,
the
report
be
convey
in
Miss
Guest
's
letter
to
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
have
frequent
tiding
through
her
mother
,
or
aunt
Glegg
,
or
Dr.
Kenn
,
of
Lucy
's
gradual
progress
toward
recovery
,
and
her
thought
tend
continually
toward
her
uncle
Deane
's
house
;
she
hunger
for
an
interview
with
Lucy
,
if
it
be
only
for
five
minute
,
to
utter
a
word
of
penitence
,
to
be
assure
by
Lucy
's
own
eye
and
lip
that
she
do
not
believe
in
the
willing
treachery
of
those
whom
she
have
love
and
trust
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
that
even
if
her
uncle
's
indignation
have
not
close
his
house
against
her
,
the
agitation
of
such
an
interview
would
have
be
forbid
to
Lucy
.
<EOS>
only
to
have
see
her
without
speak
would
have
be
some
relief
;
for
Maggie
be
haunt
by
a
face
cruel
in
its
very
gentleness
;
a
face
that
have
be
turn
on
her
with
glad
,
sweet
look
of
trust
and
love
from
the
twilight
time
of
memory
;
change
now
to
a
sad
and
weary
face
by
a
first
heart
-
stroke
.
<EOS>
and
as
the
day
pass
on
,
that
pale
image
become
more
and
more
distinct
;
the
picture
grow
and
grow
into
more
speak
definiteness
under
the
avenge
hand
of
remorse
;
the
soft
hazel
eye
,
in
their
look
of
pain
,
be
bent
forever
on
Maggie
,
and
pierce
her
the
more
because
she
could
see
no
anger
in
them
.
<EOS>
but
Lucy
be
not
yet
able
to
go
to
church
,
or
any
place
where
Maggie
could
see
her
;
and
even
the
hope
of
that
depart
,
when
the
news
be
tell
her
by
aunt
Glegg
,
that
Lucy
be
really
go
away
in
a
few
day
to
Scarborough
with
the
Miss
Guests
,
who
have
be
hear
to
say
that
they
expect
their
brother
to
meet
them
there
.
  
<EOS>
only
those
who
have
know
what
hardest
inward
conflict
be
,
can
know
what
Maggie
feel
as
she
sit
in
her
loneliness
the
evening
after
hear
that
news
from
Mrs.
Glegg
,
 
only
those
who
have
know
what
it
be
to
dread
their
own
selfish
desire
as
the
watch
mother
would
dread
the
sleeping
-
potion
that
be
to
still
her
own
pain
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
without
candle
in
the
twilight
,
with
the
window
wide
open
toward
the
river
;
the
sense
of
oppressive
heat
add
itself
undistinguishably
to
the
burthen
of
her
lot
.
<EOS>
seat
on
a
chair
against
the
window
,
with
her
arm
on
the
windowsill
she
be
look
blankly
at
the
flow
river
,
swift
with
the
backward
-
rush
tide
,
struggle
to
see
still
the
sweet
face
in
its
unreproache
sadness
,
that
seem
now
from
moment
to
moment
to
sink
away
and
be
hide
behind
a
form
that
thrust
itself
between
,
and
make
darkness
.
<EOS>
hear
the
door
open
,
she
think
Mrs.
Jakin
be
come
in
with
her
supper
,
as
usual
;
and
with
that
repugnance
to
trivial
speech
which
come
with
languor
and
wretchedness
,
she
shrink
from
turn
round
and
say
she
want
nothing
;
good
little
Mrs.
Jakin
would
be
sure
to
make
some
well
-
mean
remark
.
<EOS>
but
the
next
moment
,
without
her
have
discern
the
sound
of
a
footstep
,
she
feel
a
light
hand
on
her
shoulder
,
and
hear
a
voice
close
to
her
saying
,
"
Maggie

"
  
<EOS>
the
face

there
,

but
all
the
sweeter
;

be
there

with
their

tenderness

"
Maggie

"
Lucy

answer
a
voice
with
a
sharp
ring
of
anguish
in

and
Lucy

her
arm
round
Maggie

neck
,
and
lean
her
pale
cheek
against
the
burn
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

out

Lucy
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
while
she
sit
down
close
to
Maggie
and
hold
her
hand
,
"
when
papa

stay
a
little
while

because
it
be
so
late

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
say
that
at
first
than
to
say
anything
else
.
<EOS>
They
sit
look
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
the
interview
must
end
without
more
speech
,
for
speech
be
very
difficult
.
<EOS>
each
feel
that
there
would
be
something
scorch
in
the
word
that
would
recall
the
irretrievable
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
soon
,
as
Maggie
look
,
every
distinct
thought
begin
to
be
overflow
by
a
wave
of
love
penitence
,
and
word
burst
forth
with
a
sob
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
for
come
,
Lucy

<EOS>
the
sobs
come
thick
on
each
other
after
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie

dear

be
comfort

say
Lucy
now
,
put
her
cheek
against
Maggie
be
again
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
grieve
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
sit
still
,
hope
to
soothe
Maggie
with
that
gentle
caress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
deceive
you
,
Lucy
,
"
say
Maggie
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
.
<EOS>
"
It
always
make
me
wretched
that
I
feel
what
I
do
not
like
you
to
know

<EOS>
It
be
because
I
think
it
would
all
be
conquer
,

you

never

anything

wound
you

<EOS>
"
I

Lucy

<EOS>
"
I
know
you
never

make
me
unhappy

It
be
a
trouble
that
have
come
on
us
all

you
have
more
to
bear
than
I
have

you
give
him
up
,
when
 
you
do
what
it

have

very
hard

<EOS>
They
be
silent
again
a
little
while

sit
with
clasped

lean
together

He

<EOS>
these
word
be
wring
forth
from
Maggie
's
deep
soul
,
with
an
effort
like
the
convulse
clutch
of
a
drown
man
.
<EOS>
Lucy
tremble
and
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
a
gentle
knock
come
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
Alice
,
the
maid
,
who
enter
and
say
,
    
"
I
dare
not
stay
any
longer
,
Miss
Deane

They
will
find
it
out

and
there
will
be
such
anger
at
your
come
out
so
late

"
  
<EOS>
Lucy
rise
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
Alice
,
 
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
to
go
away
on
Friday

Maggie

"
she
add
,
when
Alice
have
close
the
door
again
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
come
back
,
and
be
strong
,
they
will
let
me
do
as
I
like
.
<EOS>
I
shall
come
to
you
when
I
please
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lucy
,
"
say
Maggie
,
with
another
great
effort
,
"
I
pray
to
God
continually
that
I
may
never
be
the
cause
of
sorrow
to
you
any
more

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
press
the
little
hand
that
she
hold
between
hers
,
and
look
up
into
the
face
that
be
bent
over
hers
.
<EOS>
Lucy
never
forget
that
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
low
voice
,
that
have
the
solemnity
of
confession
in
it
,
"
you
be
well
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
   
"
  
<EOS>
She
break
off
there
,
and
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
they
clasp
each
other
again
in
a
last
embrace
.
    
<EOS>
the
last
conflict
  
<EOS>
in
the
second
week
of
September
,
Maggie
be
again
sit
in
her
lonely
room
,
battle
with
the
old
shadowy
enemy
that
be
forever
slay
and
rise
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
past
midnight
,
and
the
rain
be
beat
heavily
against
the
window
,
drive
with
fitful
force
by
the
rushing
,
loud
-
moan
wind
.
<EOS>
for
the
day
after
Lucy
's
visit
there
have
be
a
sudden
change
in
the
weather
;
the
heat
and
drought
have
give
way
to
cold
variable
wind
,
and
heavy
fall
of
rain
at
interval
;
and
she
have
be
forbid
to
risk
the
contemplate
journey
until
the
weather
should
become
more
settled
.
<EOS>
in
the
county
high
up
the
Floss
<EOS>
the
rain
have
be
continuous
,
and
the
completion
of
the
harvest
have
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
for
the
last
two
day
,
the
rain
on
this
low
course
of
the
river
have
be
incessant
,
so
that
the
old
man
have
shake
their
head
and
talk
of
sixty
year
ago
,
when
the
same
sort
of
weather
,
happen
about
the
equinox
,
bring
on
the
great
flood
,
which
sweep
the
bridge
away
,
and
reduce
the
town
to
great
misery
.
<EOS>
but
the
young
generation
,
who
have
see
several
small
flood
,
think
lightly
of
these
sombre
recollection
and
foreboding
;
and
Bob
Jakin
,
naturally
prone
to
take
a
hopeful
view
of
his
own
luck
,
laugh
at
his
mother
when
she
regret
their
have
take
a
house
by
the
riverside
,
observe
that
<EOS>
but
for
that
they
would
have
have
no
boat
,
which
be
the
most
lucky
of
possession
in
case
of
a
flood
that
oblige
them
to
go
to
a
distance
for
food
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
careless
and
the
fearful
be
alike
sleep
in
their
bed
now
.
<EOS>
there
be
hope
that
the
rain
would
abate
by
the
morrow
;
threatening
of
a
bad
kind
,
from
sudden
thaw
after
fall
of
snow
,
have
often
pass
off
,
in
the
experience
of
the
young
one
;
and
at
the
very
bad
,
the
bank
would
be
sure
to
break
low
down
the
river
when
the
tide
come
in
with
violence
,
and
so
the
water
would
be
carry
off
,
without
cause
more
than
temporary
inconvenience
,
and
loss
that
would
be
feel
only
by
the
poor
sort
,
whom
charity
would
relieve
.
  
<EOS>
all
be
in
their
bed
now
,
for
it
be
past
midnight
;
all
except
some
solitary
watcher
such
as
Maggie
.
<EOS>
She
be
seat
in
her
little
parlor
toward
the
river
,
with
one
candle
,
that
leave
everything
dim
in
the
room
except
a
letter
which
lie
before
her
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
that
letter
,
which
have
come
to
her
to
-
day
,
be
one
of
the
cause
that
have
keep
her
up
far
on
into
the
night
,
unconscious
how
the
hour
be
go
,
careless
of
seek
rest
,
with
no
image
of
rest
come
across
her
mind
,
except
of
that
far
,
far
off
rest
from
which
there
would
be
no
more
wake
for
her
into
this
struggle
earthly
life
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
before
Maggie
receive
that
letter
,
she
have
be
to
the
Rectory
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
the
heavy
rain
would
have
prevent
her
from
go
since
;
but
there
be
another
reason
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
,
at
first
enlighten
only
by
a
few
hint
as
to
the
new
turn
which
gossip
and
slander
have
take
in
relation
to
Maggie
,
have
recently
be
make
more
fully
aware
of
it
by
an
earnest
remonstrance
from
one
of
his
male
parishioner
against
the
indiscretion
of
persist
in
the
attempt
to
overcome
the
prevalent
feeling
in
the
parish
by
a
course
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Kenn
,
have
a
conscience
void
of
offence
in
the
matter
,
be
still
inclined
to
persevere
,
 
be
still
averse
to
give
way
before
a
public
sentiment
that
be
odious
and
contemptible
;
but
he
be
finally
work
upon
by
the
consideration
of
the
peculiar
responsibility
attach
to
his
office
,
of
avoid
the
appearance
of
evil
,
 
an
"
appearance
"
that
be
always
dependent
on
the
average
quality
of
surround
mind
.
<EOS>
where
these
mind
be
low
and
gross
,
the
area
of
that
"
appearance
"
be
proportionately
widen
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
in
danger
of
act
from
obstinacy
;
perhaps
it
be
his
duty
to
succumb
.
<EOS>
conscientious
people
be
apt
to
see
their
duty
in
that
which
be
the
most
painful
course
;
and
to
recede
be
always
painful
to
Dr.
Kenn
.
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mind
that
he
must
advise
Maggie
to
go
away
from
St.
Ogg
be
for
a
time
;
and
he
perform
that
difficult
task
with
as
much
delicacy
as
he
could
,
only
state
in
vague
term
that
he
find
his
attempt
to
countenance
her
stay
be
a
source
of
discord
between
himself
and
his
parishioner
,
that
be
likely
to
obstruct
his
usefulness
as
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
He
beg
her
to
allow
him
to
write
to
a
clerical
friend
of
his
,
who
may
possibly
take
her
into
his
own
family
as
governess
;
and
,
if
not
,
would
probably
know
of
some
other
available
position
for
a
young
woman
in
whose
welfare
Dr.
Kenn
feel
a
strong
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Maggie
listen
with
a
tremble
lip
;
she
could
say
nothing
but
a
faint
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
I
shall
be
grateful
"
;
and
she
walk
back
to
her
lodging
,
through
the
drive
rain
,
with
a
new
sense
of
desolation
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
a
lonely
wanderer
;
she
must
go
out
among
fresh
face
,
that
would
look
at
her
wonderingly
,
because
the
day
do
not
seem
joyful
to
her
;
she
must
begin
a
new
life
,
in
which
she
would
have
to
rouse
herself
to
receive
new
impression
;
and
she
be
so
unspeakably
,
sickeningly
weary
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
home
,
no
help
for
the
err
;
even
those
who
pity
be
constrain
to
hardness
.
<EOS>
but
ought
she
to
complain
?
<EOS>
Ought
she
to
shrink
in
this
way
from
the
long
penance
of
life
,
which
be
all
the
possibility
she
have
of
lighten
the
load
to
some
other
sufferer
,
and
so
change
that
passionate
error
into
a
new
force
of
unselfish
human
love
?
<EOS>
all
the
next
day
she
sit
in
her
lonely
room
,
with
a
window
darken
by
the
cloud
and
the
drive
rain
,
think
of
that
future
,
and
wrestle
for
patience
;
for
what
repose
could
poor
Maggie
ever
win
except
by
wrestling
?
  
<EOS>
and
on
the
third
day
 
this
day
of
which
she
have
just
sit
out
the
close
 
<EOS>
the
letter
have
come
which
be
lie
on
the
table
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
be
from
Stephen
.
<EOS>
He
be
come
back
from
Holland
;
he
be
at
Mudport
again
,
unknown
to
any
of
his
friend
,
and
have
write
to
her
from
that
place
,
enclose
the
letter
to
a
person
whom
he
trust
in
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
from
begin
to
end
it
be
a
passionate
cry
of
reproach
;
an
appeal
against
her
useless
sacrifice
of
him
,
of
herself
,
against
that
perverted
notion
of
right
which
lead
her
to
crush
all
his
hope
,
for
the
sake
of
a
mere
idea
,
and
not
any
substantial
good
,
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
his
_
hope
,
whom
she
love
,
and
who
love
her
with
that
single
overpower
passion
,
that
worship
,
which
a
man
never
give
to
a
woman
more
than
once
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
write
to
me
that
you
be
to
marry
Kenn
.
<EOS>
as
if
I
should
believe
that
!
<EOS>
perhaps
they
have
tell
you
some
such
fable
about
me
.
<EOS>
perhaps
they
tell
you
I
have
be
"
travel
.
<EOS>
"
My
body
have
be
drag
about
somewhere
;
but
_
I
_
have
never
travel
from
the
hideous
place
where
you
leave
me
;
where
I
start
up
from
the
stupor
of
helpless
rage
to
find
you
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maggie
!
<EOS>
whose
pain
can
have
be
like
mine
?
<EOS>
whose
injury
be
like
mine
?
<EOS>
who
besides
me
have
meet
that
long
look
of
love
that
have
burn
itself
into
my
soul
,
so
that
no
other
image
can
come
there
?
<EOS>
Maggie
,
call
me
back
to
you
!
<EOS>
call
me
back
to
life
and
goodness
!
<EOS>
I
be
banish
from
both
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
motive
;
I
be
indifferent
to
everything
.
<EOS>
two
month
have
only
deepen
the
certainty
that
I
can
never
care
for
life
without
you

<EOS>
write
me
one
word
;
say
"
come
!
"
<EOS>
in
two
day
I
should
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
Maggie
,
have
you
forget
what
it
be
to
be
together
,
 
to
be
within
reach
of
a
look
,
to
be
within
hearing
of
each
other
's
voice
?
"
  
<EOS>
when
Maggie
first
read
this
letter
she
feel
as
if
her
real
temptation
have
only
just
begin
.
<EOS>
at
the
entrance
of
the
chill
dark
cavern
,
we
turn
with
unworn
courage
from
the
warm
light
;
but
how
,
when
we
have
tread
far
in
the
damp
darkness
,
and
have
begin
to
be
faint
and
weary
;
how
,
if
there
be
a
sudden
opening
above
us
,
and
we
be
invite
back
again
to
the
life
-
nourish
day
?
<EOS>
the
leap
of
natural
longing
from
under
the
pressure
of
pain
be
so
strong
,
that
all
less
immediate
motive
be
likely
to
be
forget
 
till
the
pain
have
be
escape
from
.
  
<EOS>
for
hour
Maggie
feel
as
if
her
struggle
have
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
for
hour
every
other
thought
that
she
strove
to
summon
be
thrust
aside
by
the
image
of
Stephen
wait
for
the
single
word
that
would
bring
him
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
_
read
_
<EOS>
the
letter
<EOS>
:
she
hear
him
utter
it
,
and
the
voice
shake
her
with
its
old
strange
power
.
<EOS>
all
the
day
before
she
have
be
fill
with
the
vision
of
a
lonely
future
through
which
she
must
carry
the
burthen
of
regret
,
uphold
only
by
cling
faith
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
close
within
her
reach
,
urge
itself
upon
her
even
as
a
claim
,
be
another
future
,
in
which
hard
endurance
and
effort
be
to
be
exchange
for
easy
,
delicious
lean
on
another
's
loving
strength
!
<EOS>
and
yet
that
promise
of
joy
in
the
place
of
sadness
do
not
make
the
dire
force
of
the
temptation
to
Maggie
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Stephen
's
tone
of
misery
,
it
be
the
doubt
in
the
justice
of
her
own
resolve
,
that
make
the
balance
tremble
,
and
make
her
once
start
from
her
seat
to
reach
the
pen
and
paper
,
and
write
"
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
close
upon
that
decisive
act
,
her
mind
recoil
;
and
the
sense
of
contradiction
with
her
past
self
in
her
moment
of
strength
and
clearness
come
upon
her
like
a
pang
of
conscious
degradation
.
<EOS>
no
,
she
must
wait
;
she
must
pray
;
the
light
that
have
forsake
her
would
come
again
;
she
should
feel
again
what
she
have
feel
when
she
have
flee
away
,
under
an
inspiration
strong
enough
to
conquer
agony
,
 
to
conquer
love
;
she
should
feel
again
what
she
have
feel
when
Lucy
stand
by
her
,
when
Philip
's
letter
have
stir
all
the
fibre
that
bind
her
to
the
calm
past
.
  
<EOS>
She
sit
quite
still
,
far
on
into
the
night
,
with
no
impulse
to
change
her
attitude
,
without
active
force
enough
even
for
the
mental
act
of
prayer
;
only
wait
for
the
light
that
would
surely
come
again
.
<EOS>
It
come
with
the
memory
that
no
passion
could
long
quench
;
the
long
past
come
back
to
her
,
and
with
it
the
fountain
of
self
-
renounce
pity
and
affection
,
of
faithfulness
and
resolve
.
<EOS>
the
word
that
be
mark
by
the
quiet
hand
in
the
little
old
book
that
she
have
long
ago
learn
by
heart
,
rush
even
to
her
lip
,
and
find
a
vent
for
themselves
in
a
low
murmur
that
be
quite
lose
in
the
loud
driving
of
the
rain
against
the
window
and
the
loud
moan
and
roar
of
the
wind
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
receive
the
Cross
,
I
have
receive
it
from
Thy
hand
;
I
will
bear
it
,
and
bear
it
till
death
,
as
Thou
hast
lay
it
upon
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
soon
other
word
rise
that
could
find
no
utterance
but
in
a
sob
,
 
"
forgive
me
,
Stephen
!
<EOS>
It
will
pass
away
.
<EOS>
You
will
come
back
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
take
up
the
letter
,
hold
it
to
the
candle
,
and
let
it
burn
slowly
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
she
would
write
to
him
the
last
word
of
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
bear
it
,
and
bear
it
till
death
.
<EOS>
but
how
long
it
will
be
before
death
come
!
<EOS>
I
be
so
young
,
so
healthy
.
<EOS>
how
shall
I
have
patience
and
strength
?
<EOS>
be
I
to
struggle
and
fall
and
repent
again
?
<EOS>
have
life
other
trial
as
hard
for
me
still
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
cry
of
self
-
despair
,
Maggie
fall
on
her
knee
against
the
table
,
and
bury
her
sorrow
-
stricken
face
.
<EOS>
Her
soul
go
out
to
the
Unseen
Pity
that
would
be
with
her
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
surely
there
be
something
be
teach
her
by
this
experience
of
great
need
;
and
she
must
be
learn
a
secret
of
human
tenderness
and
long
-
suffer
,
that
the
less
err
could
hardly
know
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
God
,
if
my
life
be
to
be
long
,
let
me
live
to
bless
and
comfort
   
<EOS>
"
  
at
that
moment
Maggie
feel
a
startling
sensation
of
sudden
cold
about
her
knee
and
foot
;
it
be
water
flow
under
her
.
<EOS>
She
start
up
;
the
stream
be
flow
under
the
door
that
lead
into
the
passage
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
bewilder
for
an
instant
;
she
know
it
be
the
flood
!
  
<EOS>
the
tumult
of
emotion
she
have
be
endure
for
the
last
twelve
hour
seem
to
have
leave
a
great
calm
in
her
;
without
scream
,
she
hurry
with
the
candle
upstairs
to
Bob
Jakin
's
bedroom
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
ajar
;
she
go
in
and
shake
him
by
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bob
,
the
flood
be
come
!
<EOS>
it
be
in
the
house
;
let
us
see
if
we
can
make
the
boat
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
light
his
candle
,
while
the
poor
wife
,
snatch
up
her
baby
,
burst
into
scream
;
and
then
she
hurry
down
again
to
see
if
the
water
be
rise
fast
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
step
down
into
the
room
at
the
door
lead
from
the
staircase
;
she
see
that
the
water
be
already
on
a
level
with
the
step
.
<EOS>
while
she
be
look
,
something
come
with
a
tremendous
crash
against
the
window
,
and
send
the
leaded
pane
and
the
old
wooden
framework
inward
in
shiver
,
the
water
pour
in
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
boat
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
Bob
,
come
down
to
get
the
boat
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
without
a
moment
's
shudder
of
fear
,
she
plunge
through
the
water
,
which
be
rise
fast
to
her
knee
,
and
by
the
glimmering
light
of
the
candle
she
have
leave
on
the
stair
,
she
mount
on
to
the
window
-
sill
,
and
creep
into
the
boat
,
which
be
leave
with
the
prow
lodge
and
protrude
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
Bob
be
not
long
after
her
,
hurry
without
shoe
or
stocking
,
but
with
the
lanthorn
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
they
be
both
here
,
 
both
the
boat
,
"
say
Bob
,
as
he
get
into
the
one
where
Maggie
be
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
wonderful
<EOS>
this
fastening
be
not
break
too
,
as
well
as
the
mooring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
excitement
of
get
into
the
other
boat
,
unfasten
it
,
and
master
an
oar
,
Bob
be
not
strike
with
the
danger
Maggie
incur
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
apt
to
fear
for
the
fearless
,
when
we
be
companion
in
their
danger
,
and
Bob
's
mind
be
absorb
in
possible
expedient
for
the
safety
of
the
helpless
indoor
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
Maggie
have
be
up
,
have
wake
him
,
and
have
take
the
lead
in
activity
,
give
Bob
a
vague
impression
of
her
as
one
who
would
help
to
protect
,
not
need
to
be
protect
.
<EOS>
She
too
have
get
possession
of
an
oar
,
and
have
push
off
,
so
as
to
release
the
boat
from
the
overhang
window
-
frame
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
water
's
rise
so
fast
,
"
say
Bob
,
"
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
will
be
in
at
the
chamber
before
long
,
 
th

house
be
so
low

<EOS>
I
have
more
mind
to
get
Prissy
and
the
child
and
the
mother
into
the
boat
,
if
I
could
,
and
trusten
to
the
water

for
th

old
house
<EOS>
be
none
so
safe
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
let
go
the
boat
 
<EOS>
but
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
,
"
he
exclaim
,
suddenly
lift
the
light
of
his
lanthorn
on
Maggie
,
as
she
stand
in
the
rain
with
the
oar
in
her
hand
and
her
black
hair
streaming
.
  
<EOS>
Maggie
have
no
time
to
answer
,
for
a
new
tidal
current
sweep
along
the
line
of
the
house
,
and
drive
both
the
boat
out
on
to
the
wide
water
,
with
a
force
that
carry
them
far
past
the
meeting
current
of
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
moment
Maggie
feel
nothing
,
thought
of
nothing
,
but
that
she
have
suddenly
pass
away
from
that
life
which
she
have
be
dread
;
it
be
the
transition
of
death
,
without
its
agony
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
alone
in
the
darkness
with
God
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
have
be
so
rapid
,
so
dreamlike
,
that
the
thread
of
ordinary
association
be
break
;
she
sink
down
on
the
seat
clutch
the
oar
mechanically
,
and
for
a
long
while
have
no
distinct
conception
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
that
wake
her
to
full
consciousness
be
the
cessation
of
the
rain
,
and
a
perception
that
the
darkness
be
divide
by
the
faint
light
,
which
part
the
overhang
gloom
from
the
immeasurable
watery
level
below
.
<EOS>
She
be
drive
out
upon
the
flood
,
 
that
awful
visitation
of
God
which
her
father
use
to
talk
of
;
which
have
make
the
nightmare
of
her
childish
dream
.
<EOS>
and
with
that
thought
there
rush
in
the
vision
of
the
old
home
,
and
Tom
,
and
her
mother
,
 
they
have
all
listen
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
God
,
where
be
I
?
<EOS>
which
be
the
way
home
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cry
out
,
in
the
dim
loneliness
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
happen
to
them
at
the
Mill
?
<EOS>
the
flood
have
once
nearly
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
in
danger
,
in
distress
,
 
her
mother
and
her
brother
,
alone
there
,
beyond
reach
of
help
!
<EOS>
Her
whole
soul
be
strain
now
on
that
thought
;
and
she
see
the
long
-
love
face
look
for
help
into
the
darkness
,
and
find
none
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
float
in
smooth
water
now
,
 
perhaps
far
on
the
overfloode
field
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sense
of
present
danger
to
check
the
outgoing
of
her
mind
to
the
old
home
;
and
she
strain
her
eye
against
the
curtain
of
gloom
that
she
may
seize
the
first
sight
of
her
whereabout
,
 
that
she
may
catch
some
faint
suggestion
of
the
spot
toward
which
all
her
anxiety
tend
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
how
welcome
,
the
widening
of
that
dismal
watery
level
,
the
gradual
uplifting
of
the
cloudy
firmament
,
the
slowly
define
blackness
of
object
above
the
glassy
dark
!
<EOS>
yes
,
she
must
be
out
on
the
field
;
those
be
the
top
of
hedgerow
tree
.
<EOS>
which
way
do
the
river
lie
?
<EOS>
look
behind
her
,
she
see
the
line
of
black
tree
;
look
before
her
,
there
be
none
;
then
the
river
lie
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
seize
an
oar
and
begin
to
paddle
the
boat
forward
with
the
energy
of
waken
hope
;
the
dawning
seem
to
advance
more
swiftly
,
now
she
be
in
action
;
and
she
could
soon
see
the
poor
dumb
beast
crowd
piteously
on
a
mound
where
they
have
take
refuge
.
<EOS>
Onward
she
paddle
and
row
by
turn
in
the
grow
twilight
;
her
wet
clothe
cling
round
her
,
and
her
streaming
hair
be
dash
about
by
the
wind
,
but
she
be
hardly
conscious
of
any
bodily
sensation
,
 
except
a
sensation
of
strength
,
inspire
by
mighty
emotion
.
<EOS>
along
with
the
sense
of
danger
and
possible
rescue
for
those
long
-
remember
being
at
the
old
home
,
there
be
an
undefined
sense
of
reconcilement
with
her
brother
;
what
quarrel
,
what
harshness
,
what
unbelief
in
each
other
can
subsist
in
the
presence
of
a
great
calamity
,
when
all
the
artificial
vesture
of
our
life
be
go
,
and
we
be
all
one
with
each
other
in
primitive
mortal
need
?
<EOS>
vaguely
Maggie
feel
this
,
in
the
strong
resurgent
love
toward
her
brother
that
sweep
away
all
the
later
impression
of
hard
,
cruel
offence
and
misunderstanding
,
and
leave
only
the
deep
,
underlying
,
unshakable
memory
of
early
union
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
a
large
dark
mass
in
the
distance
,
and
near
to
her
Maggie
could
discern
the
current
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
the
dark
mass
must
be
 
<EOS>
yes
,
it
be
 
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
ah
,
now
she
know
which
way
to
look
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
well
-
know
tree
 
the
gray
willow
,
the
now
yellow
chestnut
 
and
above
them
the
old
roof
!
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
color
,
no
shape
yet
;
all
be
faint
and
dim
.
<EOS>
more
and
more
strongly
the
energy
seem
to
come
and
put
themselves
forth
,
as
if
her
life
be
a
store
-
up
force
that
be
be
spend
in
this
hour
,
unneede
for
any
future
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
get
her
boat
into
the
current
of
the
Floss
,
else
she
would
never
be
able
to
pass
the
Ripple
and
approach
the
house
;
this
be
the
thought
that
occur
to
her
,
as
she
imagine
with
more
and
more
vividness
<EOS>
the
state
of
thing
round
the
old
home
.
<EOS>
but
then
she
may
be
carry
very
far
down
,
and
be
unable
to
guide
her
boat
out
of
the
current
again
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
distinct
idea
of
danger
begin
to
press
upon
her
;
but
there
be
no
choice
of
course
,
no
room
for
hesitation
,
and
she
float
into
the
current
.
<EOS>
swiftly
she
go
now
without
effort
;
more
and
more
clearly
in
the
lessen
distance
and
the
grow
light
<EOS>
she
begin
to
discern
the
object
that
she
know
must
be
the
well
-
know
tree
and
roof
;
nay
,
she
be
not
far
off
a
rushing
,
muddy
current
that
must
be
the
strangely
alter
Ripple
.
  
<EOS>
Great
God
!
<EOS>
there
be
float
masse
in
it
,
that
may
dash
against
her
boat
as
she
pass
,
and
cause
her
to
perish
too
soon
.
<EOS>
what
be
those
masse
?
  
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
Maggie
's
heart
begin
to
beat
in
an
agony
of
dread
.
<EOS>
She
sit
helpless
,
dimly
conscious
that
she
be
be
float
along
,
more
intensely
conscious
of
the
anticipate
clash
.
<EOS>
but
the
horror
be
transient
;
it
pass
away
before
the
oncoming
warehouse
of
St.
Ogg
's
.
<EOS>
She
have
pass
the
mouth
of
the
Ripple
,
then
;
<EOS>
_
now
<EOS>
_
,
she
must
use
all
her
skill
and
power
to
manage
the
boat
and
get
it
if
possible
out
of
the
current
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
now
that
the
bridge
be
break
down
;
she
could
see
the
mast
of
a
strand
vessel
far
out
over
the
watery
field
.
<EOS>
but
no
boat
be
to
be
see
move
on
the
river
,
 
such
as
have
be
lay
hand
on
be
employ
in
the
flood
street
.
  
<EOS>
with
new
resolution
,
Maggie
seize
her
oar
,
and
stand
up
again
to
paddle
;
but
the
now
ebb
tide
add
to
the
swiftness
of
the
river
,
and
she
be
carry
along
beyond
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
She
could
hear
shout
from
the
window
overlook
the
river
,
as
if
the
people
there
be
call
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
she
have
pass
on
nearly
to
Tofton
that
she
could
get
the
boat
clear
of
the
current
.
<EOS>
then
with
one
yearning
look
toward
her
uncle
Deane
's
house
that
lie
farther
down
the
river
,
she
take
to
both
her
oar
and
row
with
all
her
may
across
the
watery
field
,
back
toward
the
Mill
.
<EOS>
color
be
begin
to
awake
now
,
and
as
she
approach
the
Dorlcote
field
,
she
could
discern
the
tint
of
the
tree
,
could
see
the
old
Scotch
fir
far
to
the
right
,
and
the
home
chestnut
,
 
oh
,
how
deep
they
lie
in
the
water
,
 
deeper
than
the
tree
on
this
side
the
hill
!
<EOS>
and
the
roof
of
the
Mill
 
<EOS>
where
be
it
?

<EOS>
Her

She

say
Tom
,
in
a
voice
of
deep
astonishment
,
as
he
open
the
middle
window
,
on
a
level
with
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

Tom

<EOS>
"

;
"
I
fear
the
man

down
the
Ripple
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
when
part
of
the
Mill

with
the
crash
of
tree
and
stone
against
it
;
I
have
shout
again
and
again
,
and
there
have
be
no
answer
.
<EOS>
give
me
the
oar
,
Maggie

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
Tom
have
push
off
and
they
be
on
the
wide
water
,
 
<EOS>
he
face
to
face
with
Maggie
,
 
that
the
full
meaning
of
what
have
happen
rush
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
come
with
so
overpower
a
force
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
such
a
new
revelation
to
his
spirit
,
of
the
depth
in
life
that
have
lain
beyond
his
vision
,
which
he
have
fancy
so
keen
and
clear
,
 
that
he
be
unable
to
ask
a
question
.
<EOS>
They
sit
mutely
gaze
at
each
other
,
 
Maggie
with
eye
of
intense
life
look
out
from
a
weary
,
beat
face
;
Tom
pale
,
with
a
certain
awe
and
humiliation
.
<EOS>
thought
be
busy
though
the
lip
be
silent
;
and
though
he
could
ask
no
question
,
he
guess
a
story
of
almost
miraculous
,
divinely
protect
effort
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
a
mist
gather
over
the
blue
-
gray
eye
,
and
the
lip
find
a
word
they
could
utter
,
 
the
old
childish
"
Magsie
!
"
  
<EOS>
Maggie
could
make
no
answer
but
a
long
,
deep
sob
of
that
mysterious
,
wondrous
happiness
that
be
one
with
pain
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
she
say
,
"
We
will
go
to
Lucy

Tom

we
will
go
and
see
if

and
then

help
the
rest

"
  
<EOS>
Tom
row
with
untired
vigor
,
and
with
a
different
speed
from
poor
Maggie
's
.
<EOS>
the
boat
be
soon
in
the
current
of
the
river
again
,
and
soon
they
would
be
at
Tofton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Park
House

high
up
out
of
the
flood

"
say
Maggie
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
they

.
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
else
be
say
;
a
new
danger
be
be
carry
toward
them
by
the
river
.
<EOS>
some
wooden
machinery
have
just
give
way
on
one
of
the
wharf
,
and
huge
fragment
be
be
float
along
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
rise
now
,
and
the
wide
area
of
watery
desolation
be
spread
out
in
dreadful
clearness
around
them
;
in
dreadful
clearness
float
onward
the
hurrying
,
threaten
masse
.
<EOS>
a
large
company
in
a
boat
that
be
work
its
way
along
under
the
Tofton
house
observe
their
danger
,
and
shout
,
"
get
out
of
the
current
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
that
could
not
be
do
at
once
;
and
Tom
,
look
before
him
,
see
death
rush
on
them
.
<EOS>
huge
fragment
,
cling
together
in
fatal
fellowship
,
make
one
wide
mass
across
the
stream
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
come
,
Maggie
!
"
<EOS>
Tom
say
,
in
a
deep
,
hoarse
voice
,
loose
the
oar
,
and
clasp
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
instant
the
boat
be
no
longer
see
upon
the
water
,
and
the
huge
mass
be
hurry
on
in
hideous
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
but
soon
the
keel
of
the
boat
reappear
,
a
black
speck
on
the
golden
water
.
  
<EOS>
the
boat
reappear
,
but
brother
and
sister
have
go
down
in
an
embrace
never
to
be
part
;
live
through
again
in
one
supreme
moment
the
day
when
they
have
clasp
their
little
hand
in
love
,
and
roam
the
daisie
field
together
.
  
<EOS>
conclusion
  
<EOS>
nature
repair
her
ravage
,
 
repair
them
with
her
sunshine
,
and
with
human
labor

<EOS>
the
desolation
work
by
that
flood
have
leave
little
visible
trace
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
five
year
after
.
<EOS>
the
fifth
autumn
be
rich
in
golden
cornstack
,
rise
in
thick
cluster
among
the
distant
hedgerow
;
the
wharf
and
warehouse
on
the
Floss
be
busy
again
,
with
echo
of
eager
voice
,
with
hopeful
lading
and
unlading
.
  
<EOS>
and
every
man
and
woman
mention
in
this
history
be
still
live
,
except
those
whose
end
we
know
.
  
<EOS>
nature
repair
her
ravage
,
but
not
all
.
<EOS>
the
uptorn
tree
be
not
root
again
;
the
parted
hill
be
leave
scar
;
if
there
be
a
new
growth
,
the
tree
be
not
the
same
as
the
old

and
the
hill
underneath
their
green
vesture
bear
the
mark
of
the
past

<EOS>
to
the
eye
that
have
dwell
on
the
past
,
there
be
no
thorough

<EOS>
Dorlcote
Mill

<EOS>
and
Dorlcote

where
the
brick

prostrate
upon
it
after
the

all
its
grassy
order
and
decent
quiet

<EOS>
near
that
brick
grave
there

very
soon
after
the

for
two

and
it

at
different
moment
by
two
man
who
both
feel
that
their
keen
joy
and
keen
sorrow

forever

<EOS>
one
of
them

the
tomb
again
with
a
sweet
face
beside
him
;
but
that
be
year
after

<EOS>
the
other

always
solitary
.
<EOS>
His
great
companionship
be
among
the
tree
of
the
Red
Deeps

where
the
bury
joy

still
to
hover
,
like
a
revisit

the
name
of
Tom
and
Maggie
Tulliver

and
below
the
name

"
