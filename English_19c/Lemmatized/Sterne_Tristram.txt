  
<EOS>
to
the
right
honourable
Mr.
Pitt
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
  
never
poor
Wight
of
a
Dedicator
have
less
hope
from
his
dedication
,
than
I
have
from
this
of
mine
;
for
it
be
write
in
a
bye
corner
of
the
kingdom
,
and
in
a
retir'd
thatch'd
house
,
where
I
live
in
a
constant
endeavour
to
fence
against
the
infirmity
of
ill
health
,
and
other
evil
of
life
,
by
mirth
;
be
firmly
persuade
that
every
time
a
man
smile
,
 
but
much
more
so
,
when
he
laugh
,
it
add
something
to
this
Fragment
of
Life
.
  
<EOS>
I
humbly
beg
,
Sir
,
that
you
will
honour
this
book
,
by
take
it
 
(
not
under
your
Protection
,
 
it
must
protect
itself
,
but
)
 
into
the
country
with
you
;
where
,
if
I
be
ever
tell
,
it
have
make
you
smile
;
or
can
conceive
it
have
beguile
you
of
one
moment
's
pain
 
<EOS>
I
shall
think
myself
as
happy
as
a
minister
of
state
;
 
perhaps
much
happy
than
any
one
(
one
only
except
)
that
I
have
read
or
hear
of
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
Great
Sir
,
 
(
and
,
what
be
more
to
your
honour
,
)
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
Good
Sir
,
 
Your
well
-
wisher
,
 
and
most
humble
fellow
-
subject
,
the
Author
.
      
<EOS>
I
wish
either
my
father
or
my
mother
,
or
indeed
both
of
them
,
as
they
be
in
duty
both
equally
bind
to
it
<EOS>
,
have
mind
what
they
be
about
when
they
beget
me
;
have
they
duly
consider'd
how
much
depend
upon
what
they
be
then
do
;
 
that
not
only
the
production
of
a
rational
being
be
concerned
in
it
,
but
that
possibly
the
happy
formation
and
temperature
of
his
body
,
perhaps
his
genius
and
the
very
cast
of
his
mind
;
 
and
,
for
aught
they
know
to
the
contrary
,
even
the
fortune
of
his
whole
house
may
take
their
turn
from
the
humour
and
disposition
which
be
then
uppermost
;
 
<EOS>
have
they
duly
weigh
and
consider
all
this
,
and
proceed
accordingly
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
verily
persuaded
I
should
have
make
a
quite
different
figure
in
the
world
,
from
that
in
which
the
reader
be
likely
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
believe
me
,
<EOS>
good
folk
,
this
be
not
so
inconsiderable
a
thing
as
many
of
you
may
think
it
;
 
<EOS>
you
have
all
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
hear
of
the
animal
spirit
,
as
how
they
be
transfuse
from
father
to
son
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
and
a
great
deal
to
that
purpose
:
 
<EOS>
well
,
you
may
take
my
word
,
that
nine
part
in
ten
of
a
man
's
sense
or
his
nonsense
,
his
success
and
miscarriage
in
this
world
depend
upon
their
motion
and
activity
,
and
the
different
track
and
train
you
put
them
into
,
so
that
when
they
be
once
set
a
-
going
,
whether
right
or
wrong
,
'
tis
not
a
half-
penny
matter
,
 
away
they
go
clutter
like
hey
-
go
mad
;
and
by
tread
the
same
step
over
and
over
again
,
they
presently
make
a
road
of
it
,
as
plain
and
as
smooth
as
a
garden
-
walk
,
which
,
when
they
be
once
use
to
,
the
Devil
himself
sometimes
shall
not
be
able
to
drive
them
off
it
.
  
<EOS>
pray
my
Dear
,
quoth
my
mother
,
have
you
not
forget
to
wind
up
the
clock
?
  
<EOS>
Good
G
..
!
<EOS>
cry
my
father
,
make
an
exclamation
,
but
take
care
to
moderate
his
voice
at
the
same
time
,
 
do
ever
woman
,
since
the
creation
of
the
world
,
interrupt
a
man
with
such
a
silly
question
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
what
be
your
father
say
?
 
<EOS>
nothing
.
     
<EOS>
then
,
positively
,
there
be
nothing
in
the
question
that
I
can
see
,
either
good
or
bad
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
let
me
tell
you
,
Sir
,
it
be
a
very
unseasonable
question
at
least
,
 
because
it
scatter
and
disperse
the
animal
spirit
,
whose
business
it
be
to
have
escort
and
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
Homunculus
,
and
conduct
him
safe
to
the
place
destine
for
his
reception
.
  
<EOS>
the
Homunculus
,
Sir
,
in
however
low
and
ludicrous
a
light
he
may
appear
,
in
this
age
of
levity
,
to
the
eye
of
folly
or
prejudice
;
 
to
the
eye
of
reason
in
scientific
research
,
he
stand
confess'd
 
a
being
guard
and
circumscribe
with
right
.
 
<EOS>
the
minute
philosopher
,
who
by
the
bye
,
have
the
most
enlarged
understanding
,
(
their
soul
be
inversely
as
their
enquiry
)
<EOS>
shew
us
incontestably
,
that
the
Homunculus
be
create
by
the
same
hand
,
 
engender'd
<EOS>
in
the
same
course
of
nature
,
 
endow'd
with
the
same
loco
-
motive
power
and
faculty
with
us
:
 
that
he
consist
as
we
do
,
of
skin
,
hair
,
fat
,
flesh
,
vein
,
artery
,
ligament
,
nerve
,
cartilage
,
bone
,
marrow
,
brain
,
gland
,
genital
,
humour
,
and
articulation
;
 
be
a
being
of
as
much
activity
,
 
and
in
all
sense
of
the
word
,
as
much
and
as
truly
our
fellow
-
creature
as
my
Lord
Chancellor
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
benefit
,
 
he
may
be
injure
,
 
he
may
obtain
redress
;
in
a
word
,
he
have
all
the
claim
and
right
of
humanity
,
which
tully
,
Puffendorf
,
or
the
good
ethick
writer
allow
to
arise
out
of
that
state
and
relation
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
dear
Sir
,
what
if
any
accident
have
befall
him
in
his
way
alone
!
 
<EOS>
or
that
through
terror
of
it
,
natural
to
so
young
a
traveller
,
my
little
Gentleman
have
get
to
his
journey
's
end
miserably
spend
;
 
<EOS>
his
muscular
strength
and
virility
wear
down
to
a
thread
;
 
his
own
animal
spirit
ruffle
beyond
description
,
 
and
that
in
this
sad
disorder'd
<EOS>
state
of
nerve
,
he
have
lain
down
a
prey
to
sudden
start
,
or
a
series
of
melancholy
dream
and
fancy
,
for
nine
long
,
long
month
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
think
what
a
foundation
have
be
lay
for
a
thousand
weakness
both
of
body
and
mind
,
which
no
skill
of
the
physician
or
the
philosopher
could
ever
afterwards
have
set
thoroughly
to
right
.
     
<EOS>
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Mr.
Toby
Shandy
<EOS>
do
I
stand
indebted
for
the
precede
anecdote
,
to
whom
my
father
,
who
be
an
excellent
natural
philosopher
,
and
much
give
to
close
reasoning
upon
the
small
matter
,
have
oft
,
and
heavily
complain
of
the
injury
;
but
once
more
particularly
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
well
remember'd
,
upon
his
observe
a
most
unaccountable
obliquity
,
(
as
he
<EOS>
call'd
it
)
<EOS>
in
my
manner
of
set
up
my
top
,
and
justify
the
principle
upon
which
I
have
do
it
,
 
the
old
gentleman
shake
his
head
,
and
in
a
tone
more
expressive
by
half
of
sorrow
than
reproach
,
 
he
say
his
heart
all
along
forebode
,
and
he
see
it
verify
in
this
,
and
from
a
thousand
other
observation
he
have
make
upon
me
,
that
I
should
neither
think
nor
act
like
any
other
man
's
child
:
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
continue
he
,
shake
his
head
a
second
time
,
and
wipe
away
a
tear
which
be
trickle
down
his
cheek
,
My
Tristram
's
misfortune
begin
nine
month
before
ever
he
come
into
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
My
mother
,
who
be
sit
by
,
<EOS>
look'd
up
,
but
she
know
no
more
than
her
backside
what
my
father
mean
,
 
but
my
uncle
,
Mr.
Toby
Shandy
,
who
have
be
often
inform
of
the
affair
,
 
understand
him
very
well
.
    
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
reader
in
the
world
,
as
well
as
many
other
good
people
in
it
,
who
be
no
reader
at
all
,
 
who
find
themselves
ill
at
ease
,
unless
they
be
let
into
the
whole
secret
from
first
to
last
,
of
every
thing
which
concern
you
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
pure
compliance
with
this
humour
of
theirs
,
and
from
a
backwardness
in
my
nature
to
disappoint
any
one
soul
live
,
that
I
have
be
so
very
particular
already
.
 
<EOS>
as
my
life
and
opinion
be
likely
to
make
some
noise
in
the
world
,
and
,
if
I
conjecture
right
,
will
take
in
all
rank
,
profession
,
and
denomination
of
man
whatever
,
 
be
no
less
read
than
the
Pilgrim
's
Progress
itself
 
and
in
the
end
,
prove
the
very
thing
which
Montaigne
dread
his
essay
should
turn
out
,
that
is
,
a
book
for
a
parlour
-
window
;
 
I
find
it
necessary
to
consult
every
one
a
little
in
his
turn
;
and
therefore
must
beg
pardon
for
go
on
a
little
farther
in
the
same
way
:
 
for
which
cause
,
right
glad
I
be
,
that
I
have
begin
the
history
of
myself
in
the
way
I
have
do
;
and
that
I
be
able
to
go
on
,
trace
every
thing
in
it
,
as
Horace
say
,
ab
Ovo
.
  
<EOS>
horace
,
I
know
,
do
not
recommend
this
fashion
altogether
:
 
<EOS>
but
that
gentleman
be
speak
only
of
an
epic
poem
or
a
tragedy
;
 
<EOS>
(
I
forget
which
,
)
<EOS>
besides
,
if
it
be
not
so
,
I
should
beg
Mr.
Horace
's
pardon
;
 
for
in
write
what
I
have
set
about
,
I
shall
confine
myself
neither
to
his
rule
,
nor
to
any
man
's
rule
that
ever
live
.
  
<EOS>
to
such
however
as
do
not
choose
to
go
so
far
back
into
these
thing
,
I
can
give
no
well
advice
than
that
they
skip
over
the
remain
part
of
this
chapter
;
for
I
declare
before
-
hand
,
'
tis
write
only
for
the
curious
and
inquisitive
.
    
<EOS>
Shut
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
beget
in
the
night
betwixt
the
first
Sunday
and
the
first
Monday
in
the
month
of
March
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighteen
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
positive
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
I
come
to
be
so
very
particular
in
my
account
of
a
thing
which
happen
before
I
be
bear
,
be
owe
to
another
small
anecdote
know
only
in
our
own
family
,
but
now
make
publick
for
the
well
clearing
up
this
point
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
you
must
know
,
who
be
originally
a
Turkey
merchant
,
but
have
leave
off
business
for
some
year
,
in
order
to
retire
to
,
and
die
upon
,
his
paternal
estate
in
the
county
of
  
,
be
,
I
believe
,
one
of
the
most
regular
man
in
every
thing
he
do
,
whether
'
twas
matter
of
business
,
or
matter
of
amusement
,
that
ever
live
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
small
speciman
of
this
extreme
exactness
of
his
,
to
which
he
be
in
truth
a
slave
,
he
have
make
it
a
rule
for
many
year
of
his
life
,
 
on
the
first
Sunday
-
night
of
every
month
throughout
the
whole
year
,
 
as
certain
as
ever
the
Sunday
-
night
come
,
 
to
wind
up
a
large
house
-
clock
,
which
we
have
stand
on
the
back
-
stairs
head
,
with
his
own
hand
:
 
and
be
somewhere
between
fifty
and
sixty
year
of
age
at
the
time
I
have
be
speak
of
,
 
<EOS>
he
have
likewise
gradually
bring
some
other
little
family
concernment
to
the
same
period
,
in
order
,
as
he
would
often
say
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
get
them
all
out
of
the
way
at
one
time
,
and
be
no
more
plagued
and
pester
with
them
the
rest
of
the
month
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
attend
but
with
one
misfortune
,
which
,
in
a
great
measure
,
fall
upon
myself
,
and
the
effect
of
which
I
fear
I
shall
carry
with
me
to
my
grave
;
namely
,
that
from
an
unhappy
association
of
ideas
,
which
have
no
connection
in
nature
,
it
so
fall
out
at
length
,
that
my
poor
mother
could
never
hear
the
said
clock
wound
up
,
 
but
the
thought
of
some
other
thing
unavoidably
pop
into
her
head
 
&
vice
versa
:
 
<EOS>
which
strange
combination
of
idea
,
the
sagacious
Locke
,
who
certainly
understand
the
nature
of
these
thing
better
than
most
man
,
affirm
to
have
produce
more
wry
action
than
all
other
source
of
prejudice
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
by
the
bye
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
appear
by
a
memorandum
in
my
father
's
pocket
-
book
,
which
now
lie
upon
the
table
,
"
that
on
Lady
-
day
,
which
be
on
the
25th
of
the
same
month
in
which
I
date
my
geniture
,
 
my
father
set
upon
his
journey
to
London
,
with
my
eld
brother
Bobby
,
to
fix
him
at
Westminster
school
;
"
and
,
as
it
appear
from
the
same
authority
,
"
that
he
do
not
get
down
to
his
wife
and
family
till
the
second
week
in
May
follow
,
"
 
it
bring
the
thing
almost
to
a
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
what
follow
in
the
beginning
of
the
next
chapter
,
put
it
beyond
all
possibility
of
a
doubt
.
    
<EOS>
but
pray
,
Sir
,
what
be
your
father
do
all
December
,
January
,
and
February
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
Madam
,
 
he
be
all
that
time
afflict
with
a
Sciatica
.
     
<EOS>
on
the
fifth
day
of
November
,
1718
,
which
to
the
aera
fix
on
,
be
as
near
nine
kalendar
month
as
any
husband
could
in
reason
have
expect
,
 
be
I
<EOS>
Tristram
Shandy
,
Gentleman
,
bring
forth
into
this
scurvy
and
disastrous
world
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
be
bear
in
the
Moon
,
or
in
any
of
the
planet
,
(
except
Jupiter
or
Saturn
,
because
I
never
could
bear
cold
weather
)
for
it
could
not
well
have
fare
worse
with
me
in
any
of
them
(
though
I
will
not
answer
for
Venus
)
than
it
have
in
this
vile
,
dirty
planet
of

<EOS>
which
,
o

my

with
reverence

I
take
to

make
up

clipping
of
the
rest

not
<EOS>
but
the

be
well
enough
,
provide
a
man
could
be
bear
in
it
to
a

of
dignity
or
power
;
 
but
that
be
not
my
case
;
 
and
therefore
every
man
will
speak
of
the
fair
as
his
own
market
have
go
in
it
;
 
for
which
<EOS>
cause
I
affirm
it
over
again
to
be
one
of
the
vile
world
that
ever
be
make
;
 
<EOS>
for
I
can
truly
say
,
that
from
the
first
hour
I
draw
my
breath
in
it
,
to
this
,
that
I
can
now
scarce
draw
it
at
all
<EOS>
,
for
an
asthma
I
get
in
scating
against
the
wind
in
flander
;
 
I
have
be
the
continual
sport
of
what
the
world
call
Fortune
;
and
though
I
will
not
wrong
her
by
say
,
She
have
ever
make
me
feel
the
weight
of
any
great
or
signal
evil
;
 
yet
with
all
the
good
temper
in
the
world
I
affirm
it
of
her
,
that
in
every
stage
of
my
life
,
and
at
every
turn
and
corner
where
she
could
get
fairly
at
me
,
the
ungracious
duchess
have
pelt
me
with
a
set
of
as
pitiful
misadventure
and
cross
accident
as
ever
small
Hero
sustain
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
chapter
,
I
inform
you
exactly
when
I
be
bear
;
but
I
do
not
inform
you
how
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
that
particular
be
reserve
entirely
for
a
chapter
by
itself
;
 
besides
,
Sir
,
as
you
and
I
be
in
a
manner
perfect
stranger
to
each
other
,
it
would
not
have
be
proper
to
have
let
you
into
too
many
circumstance
relate
to
myself
all
at
once
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
have
a
little
patience
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
undertake
,
you
see
,
to
write
not
only
my
life
,
but
<EOS>
my
opinion
also
;
hope
and
expect
that
your
knowledge
of
my
character
,
and
of
what
kind
of
a
mortal
I
be
,
by
the
one
,
would
give
you
a
well
relish
for
the
other
:
 
as
you
proceed
farther
with
me
,
the
slight
acquaintance
,
which
be
now
begin
betwixt
us
,
will
grow
into
familiarity
;
and
that
unless
one
of
us
be
in
fault
,
will
terminate
in
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
O
diem
praeclarum
!
 
<EOS>
then
nothing
which
have
touch
me
will
be
think
trifling
in
its
nature
,
or
tedious
in
its
telling
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
my
dear
friend
and
companion
,
if
you
should
think
me
somewhat
spare
of
my
narrative
on
my
first
set
out
 
bear
with
me
,
 
and
let
me
go
on
,
and
tell
my
story
my
own
way
:
 
<EOS>
or
,
if
I
should
seem
now
and
then
to
trifle
upon
the
road
,
 
or
should
sometimes
put
on
a
fool
's
cap
with
a
bell
to
it
,
for
a
moment
or
two
as
we
pass
along
<EOS>
,
 
do
not
fly
off
,
 
but
rather
courteously
give
me
credit
for
a
little
more
wisdom
than
appear
upon
my
outside
;
 
and
as
we
jog
on
,
either
laugh
with
me
,
or
at
me
,
or
in
short
do
any
thing
,
  
only
keep
your
temper
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
same
village
where
my
father
and
my
mother
dwelt
,
dwelt
also
a
thin
,
upright
,
motherly
,
notable
,
good
old
body
of
a
midwife
,
who
with
the
help
of
a
little
plain
good
sense
,
and
some
year
full
employment
in
her
business
,
in
which
she
have
all
along
trust
little
to
her
own
effort
,
and
a
great
deal
to
those
of
dame
Nature
,
 
have
acquire
,
in
her
way
,
no
small
degree
of
reputation
in
the
world
:
 
by
which
word
world
,
need
I
in
this
place
inform
your
worship
,
that
I
would
be
understand
to
mean
no
more
of
it
,
than
a
small
circle
describe
upon
the
circle
of
the
great
world
,
of
four
english
mile
diameter
,
or
thereabout
,
of
which
the
cottage
where
the
good
old
woman
live
be
suppose
to
be
the
centre
?
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
leave
<EOS>
it
seem
a
widow
in
great
distress
,
with
three
or
four
small
child
,
in
her
forty
-
seventh
year
;
and
as
she
be
at
that
time
a
person
of
decent
carriage
,
 
grave
deportment
,
 
<EOS>
a
woman
moreover
of
few
word
and
withal
an
object
of
compassion
,
whose
distress
,
and
silence
under
it
,
call
out
the
louder
for
a
friendly
lift
:
 
the
wife
of
the
parson
of
the
parish
be
touch
with
pity
;
and
have
often
lament
an
inconvenience
to
which
her
husband
's
flock
have
for
many
year
be
expose
,
inasmuch
as
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
midwife
,
of
any
kind
or
degree
,
to
be
get
at
,
let
the
case
have
be
never
so
urgent
,
within
less
than
six
or
seven
long
mile
ride
;
which
say
seven
long
mile
in
dark
night
and
dismal
road
,
the
country
thereabout
be
nothing
but
a
deep
clay
,
be
almost
equal
to
fourteen
;
and
that
in
effect
be
sometimes
next
to
have
no
midwife
at
all
<EOS>
;
it
come
into
her
head
,
that
it
would
be
do
as
seasonable
a
kindness
to
the
whole
parish
,
as
to
the
poor
creature
herself
,
to
get
her
a
little
instructed
in
some
of
the
plain
principle
of
the
business
,
in
order
to
set
her
up
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
no
woman
thereabout
be
better
qualified
to
execute
the
plan
she
have
form
than
herself
,
the
gentlewoman
very
charitably
undertake
it
;
and
have
great
influence
over
the
female
part
of
the
parish
,
she
find
no
difficulty
in
effect
it
to
the
utmost
of
her
wish
.
 
<EOS>
in
truth
,
the
parson
join'd
his
interest
with
his
wife
be
in
the
whole
affair
,
and
in
order
to
do
thing
as
they
should
be
,
and
give
the
poor
soul
as
good
a
title
by
law
to
practise
,
as
his
wife
have
give
by
institution
,
 
he
cheerfully
pay
the
fee
for
the
ordinary

licence
himself
,
amount
in
the
whole
,
to
the
sum
of
eighteen
shilling
and
four
penny
;
so
that
betwixt
them
both
,
the
good
woman
be
fully
invest
in
the
real
and
corporal
possession
of
her
office
,
together
with
all
its
right

member
,
and
appurtenance
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
these
last
word
,
you
must
know
,
be
not
accord
to
the
old
form
in
which
such
licence

faculty
,
and
power
usually
run
,
which
in
like
case
have
heretofore
be
grant

<EOS>
but
it
be
accord
to
a
neat
Formula
of
Didius
<EOS>
his

devising
,
who
have
a
particular
turn
for
take

and
new
framing
over
again
all
kind
of
instrument
in
that
way
,
not
only
hit
upon
this
dainty
amendment
,
but
coax
many
of
the
old
licensed
matron
in
the
neighbourhood
,
to
open
their
faculty
afresh
,
in
order
to
have
this
wham

wham
of

<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
never
could
envy
Didius
in
these
kind
of
fancy
of
his

but
<EOS>
every
man
to
his

<EOS>
do
not
Dr.

take
the
great
delight
imaginable
in
comb

and
pluck
the
dead
hair
out
with
his

,
though
he
have
tweezer

<EOS>
Nay

if
you
come

have
not
the

not

and
so

along

and
neither

what

De

<EOS>
that
is

there
be
no

against
Hobby

for
my

I
seldom

nor
could
I
with
any
sort
of
grace

<EOS>
have
I
be
an
enemy
to

for
happen

at
certain
interval
and
change
of
the
moon
,
to
be
both
fidler

painter
,
accord
as
the

be
it
known
to
you
,
that
I
keep
a

pad
myself
,
upon
which
,
in
their
turn
,
(
nor
do
I
care
who
know
it

<EOS>
I
frequently
ride
out

take
the

;
 
though
sometimes
,
to
my
shame
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
it
speak
<EOS>
,
I
take
somewhat
long
journie
than
what
a
wise
man
would
think
altogether
right
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
truth
be
,
 
I
be
not
a
wise
man
;
 
and
besides
be
a
mortal
of
so
little
consequence
in
the
world
,
<EOS>
it
be
not
much
matter
what
I
do
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
seldom
fret
or
fume
at
all
about
it
:
 
<EOS>
nor
do
it
much
disturb
my
rest

when
I
see
such
great

tall
Personages
as

upon

get
on

sober

other
on

tuck
up
to

with

across

scour

it
away
like
so
many
little

and
as
if
some

be
resolve
to
break
their
neck
.
 
<EOS>
so
much
the
well
 
say
I
to
myself
;
 
for
in
case
the
bad
should
happen
,
the
world
will
make
a
shift
to
do
excellently
well
without

and
for
the
rest
,
 
why
 
God
speed
them
 
<EOS>
e'en
let
them
ride
on
without
opposition
from
me

for
be
their

unhorse
this
very

'
tis
ten

that
many
of

would
be
bad

<EOS>
not
one
of
these
instance
therefore
can
be
say
to
break
in
upon
my
rest

<EOS>
but
there
be
an
instance
,
which
I
own
<EOS>
put
me
off
my
guard
,
and
that
be
,
when
I
see
one
bear
for
great
action
,
and
what
be
still
more
for
his
honour
,
whose
nature
ever
incline
him
to
good
one
;
 
when
I
behold
such
a
one
,
my
Lord
,
like
yourself
,
whose
principle
and
conduct
be
as
generous
and
noble
as
his
blood
,
and
whom
,
for
that
reason
,
a
corrupt
world
can
not
spare
one
moment
;
 
when
I
see
such
a
one
,
my
Lord

mount
,
though
it
be
but
for
a
minute
beyond
the
time
which
my
love
to
my
country
have
prescribe
to
him
,
and
my
zeal
for
his
glory
wish
,
 
then
,
<EOS>
my
Lord
,
I
cease
to
be
a
philosopher
,
and
in
the
first
transport
of
an
honest
impatience

I
wish
the
Hobby

all
his
fraternity
,
at

<EOS>
"
My
Lord

I
maintain
this
to
be
a
dedication
,
notwithstanding
its
singularity
in
the
three
great
essential
of
matter
,
form
and
place
:
 
<EOS>
I
beg
,
therefore
,
you
will
accept
it
as
such
,
and
that
you
will
permit
me
to
lay
it
,
with
the
most
respectful
humility
,
at
your
lordship
's
foot
 
when
you
be
upon

which
you

you
please

that
is

my
Lord

whenever
there
be
occasion
for
it

and
I
will
add

to
the
good
purpose
too

<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
to
be

<EOS>
My
Lord

Your

most
obedient

most
devoted

most
humble
servant

Tristram
Shandy

<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
solemnly
declare
to
all
mankind
,
that
the
above
dedication
be
make
for
no
one
Prince
,
Prelate
,
Pope
,
or
Potentate
,
 
Duke
,
Marquis
,
Earl
,
Viscount

Baron

of
this

any
other
Realm

nor
have
it
yet
be
hawk
about
,
or
offer
publicly
or
privately
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
to
any
one
person
or
personage
,
great
or
small
;
but
be
honestly
a
true
Virgin-
Dedication
untrie
on
,
upon
any
soul
live
.
   
<EOS>
I
labour
this
point
so
particularly
,
merely
to
remove
any
offence
or
objection
which
may
arise
against
it
from
the
manner
in
which
I
propose
to
make
the
most
of
it
;
 
<EOS>
which
be
the
put
it
up
fairly
to
public
sale
;
which
I
now
do
.
    
<EOS>
every
author
have
a
way
of
his
own
in
bring
his
point
to
bear
;
 
for
my
own
part
,
as
I
hate
chaffer
and
higgle
for
a
few
guinea
in
a
dark
entry
;
 
I
resolve
within
myself
,
from
the
very
beginning
,
to
deal
squarely
and
openly
with
your
Great
folk
in
this
affair
,
and
try
whether
I
should
not
come
off
the
well
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
if
therefore
there
be
any
one
Duke
,
Marquis
,
Earl
,
Viscount
,
or
Baron
,
in
these
his
Majesty
's
dominion
,
who
stand
in
need
of
a
tight
,
genteel
dedication
,
and
whom
the
above
will
suit
,
(
for
by
the
bye
,
unless
it
suit
in
some
degree
,
I
will
not
part
with
it
)
 
<EOS>
it
be
much
at
his
service
for
fifty
guinea
;
 
<EOS>
which
I
be
positive
be
twenty
guinea
less
than
it
ought
to
be
afford
for
,
by
any
man
of
genius
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lord
,
if
you
examine
it
over
again
,
it
be
far
from
be
a
gross
piece
of
daubing
,
as
some
dedication
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
design
,
your
lordship
see
,
be
good

the
colour
transparent
,
 
<EOS>
the
drawing
not
amiss
;
 
or
to
speak
more
like
a

of
science
,
 
and
measure
my
piece
in
the
painter
's
scale
,
divide
into
20
,
 
I
believe
,
my
Lord
,
the
outlines
will
turn
out
as
12
,
  
the
composition
as
9
,
 
the
colouring
as
6
,
 
the
expression
13
and
a
half

if
I
may
be
allow

<EOS>
my

to
understand
my

absolute

besides
all

there

keep

give

and
good

be

all
which

from

else

the

I
dedicate

who
,
by
the

of
all
the
Patrons

I
can
think
of

have
most
power

my

<EOS>
Bright

if
thou

too
busy
with
Candid

affair
,
 
take
Tristram

under
thy

also
.
    
<EOS>
whatever
degree
of
small
merit
the
act
of
benignity
in
favour
of
the
midwife
may
justly
claim
,
or
in
whom
that
claim
truly
rest
,
 
at
first
sight
seem
not
very
material
to
this
history
;
 
certain
however
it
be
,
that
the
gentlewoman
,
the
parson
's
wife
,
do
run
away
at
that
time
with
the
whole
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
for
my
life
,
I
can
not
help
think
but
that
the
parson
himself
,
though
he
have
not
the
good
fortune
to
hit
upon
the
design
first
,
 
yet
,
as
he
heartily
concur
in
it
the
moment
it
be
lay
before
him
,
and
as
heartily
part
with
his
money
to
carry
it
into
execution
,
have
a
claim
to
some
share
of
it
,
 
if
not
to
a
full
half
of
whatever
honour
be
due
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
world
at
that
time
be
pleased
to
determine
the
matter
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
Lay
down
the
book
,
and
I
will
allow
you
half
a
day
to
give
a
probable
guess
at
the
ground
of
this
procedure
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
known
then
,
that
,
for
about
five
year
before
the
date
of
the
midwife
's
licence
,
of
which
you
have
have
so
circumstantial
an
account
,
 
the
parson
we
have
to
do
with
have
make
himself
a
country
-
talk
by
a
breach
of
all
decorum
,
which
he
have
commit
against
himself
,
his
station
,
and
his
office
;
 
and
that
be
in
never
appear
well
,
or
otherwise
mount
,
than
upon
a
lean
,
sorry
,
jackass
of
a
horse
,
value
about
one
pound
fifteen
shilling
;
who
,
to
shorten
all
description
of
him
,
be
full
brother
to
Rosinante
,
as
far
as
similitude
congenial
could
make
him
;
for
he
answer
his
description
to
a
hair
-
breadth
in
every
thing
,
 
except
that
I
do
not
remember
'
tis
any
where
say
,
that
Rosinante
be
break
-
winded
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
Rosinante
,
as
be
the
happiness
of
most
spanish
horse
,
fat
or
lean
,
 
be
undoubtedly
a
horse
at
all
point
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
that
the
Hero
's
horse
be
a
horse
of
chaste
deportment
,
which
may
have
give
ground
for
the
contrary
opinion
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
as
certain
at
the
same
time
that
Rosinante
's
continency
(
as
may
be
demonstrate
from
the
adventure
of
the
Yanguesian
carrier
)
<EOS>
proceed
from
no
bodily
defect
or
cause
whatsoever
,
but
from
the
temperance
and
orderly
current
of
his
blood
.
 
<EOS>
and
let
me
tell
you
,
Madam
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
very
good
chastity
in
the
world
,
in
behalf
of
which
you
could
not
say
more
for
your
life
.
  
<EOS>
let
that
be
as
it
may
,
as
my
purpose
be
to
do
exact
justice
to
every
creature
bring
upon
the
stage
of
this
dramatic
work
,
 
I
could
not
stifle
this
distinction
in
favour
of
Don
Quixote
's
horse
;
 
in
all
other
point
,
the
parson
's
horse
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
be
just
such
another
,
for
he
be
as
lean
,
and
as
lank
,
and
as
sorry
a
jade
,
as
Humility
herself
could
have
bestride
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
estimation
of
here
and
there
a
man
of
weak
judgment
,
it
be
greatly
in
the
parson
's
power
to
have
help
the
figure
of
this
horse
of
his
,
 
for
he
be
master
of
a
very
handsome
demi
-
peaked
saddle
,
quilt
on
the
seat
with
green
plush
,
garnish
with
a
double
row
of
silver
-
head
stud
,
and
a
noble
pair
of
shine
brass
stirrup
,
with
a
housing
altogether
suitable
,
of
grey
superfine
cloth
,
with
an
edging
of
black
lace
,
terminate
in
a
deep
,
black
,
silk
fringe
,
poudre
d'or
,
 
all
which
he
have
purchase
in
the
pride
and
prime
of
his
life
,
together
with
a
grand
emboss
bridle
,
ornament
at
all
point
as
it
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
not
care
to
banter
his
beast
,
he
have
hang
all
these
up
behind
his
study
door
:
 
and
,
in
lieu
of
them
,
have
seriously
befit
him
with
just
such
a
bridle
and
such
a
saddle
,
as
the
figure
and
value
of
such
a
steed
may
well
and
truly
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
several
sally
about
his
parish
,
and
in
the
neighbouring
visit
to
the
gentry
who
live
around
him
,
 
you
will
easily
comprehend
,
that
the
parson
,
so
appoint
,
would
both
hear
and
see
enough
to
keep
his
philosophy
from
rust
.
 
<EOS>
to
speak
the
truth
,
he
never
could
enter
a
village
,
but
he
catch
the
attention
of
both
old
and
young
.
 
<EOS>
Labour
stand
still
as
he
pass'd
 
<EOS>
the
bucket
hung
suspend
in
the
middle
of
the
well
,
 
the
spinning-
wheel
forget
its
round
,
 
even
chuck
-
farthing
and
shuffle
-
cap
<EOS>
themselves
stand
gape
till
he
have
get
out
of
sight
;
and
as
his
movement
be
not
of
the
quick
,
he
have
generally
time
enough
upon
his
hand
to
make
his
observation
,
 
to
hear
the
groan
of
the
serious
,
 
and
the
laughter
of
the
light
-
hearted
;
all
which
he
bear
with
excellent
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
His
character
be
,
 
he
love
a
jest
in
his
heart
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
see
himself
in
the
true
point
of
ridicule
,
he
would
say
he
could
not
be
angry
with
other
for
see
him
in
a
light
,
in
which
he
so
strongly
see
himself
:
 
<EOS>
so
that
to
his
friend
,
who
know
his
foible
be
not
the
love
of
money
,
and
who
therefore
make
the
less
scruple
in
banter
the
extravagance
of
his
humour
,
 
instead
of
give
the
true
cause
,
 
he
choose
rather
to
join
in
the
laugh
against
himself
;
and
as
he
never
carry
one
single
ounce
of
flesh
upon
his
own
bone
,
be
altogether
as
spare
a
figure
as
his
beast
,
 
he
would
sometimes
insist
upon
it
,
that
the
horse
be
as
good
as
the
rider
deserve
;
 
that
they
be
,
centaur
-
like
,
 
both
of
a
piece
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
and
in
other
mood
,
when
his
spirit
be
above
the
temptation
of
false
wit
,
 
he
would
say
,
he
find
himself
go
off
fast
in
a
consumption
;
and
,
with
great
gravity
,
would
pretend
,
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
a
fat
horse
,
without
a
dejection
of
heart
,
and
a
sensible
alteration
in
his
pulse
;
and
that
he
have
make
choice
of
the
lean
one
he
ride
upon
,
not
only
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
,
but
in
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
at
different
time
he
would
give
fifty
humorous
and
apposite
reason
for
ride
a
meek
-
spirited
jade
of
a
break
-
winded
horse
,
preferably
to
one
of
mettle
;
 
for
on
such
a
one
he
could
sit
mechanically
,
and
meditate
as
delightfully
de
vanitate
mundi
et
fuga
faeculi
,
as
with
the
advantage
of
a
death's
-
head
before
him
;
 
that
,
in
all
other
exercitation
,
he
could
spend
his
time
,
as
he
ride
slowly
along
,
 
to
as
much
account
as
in
his
study
;
  
that
he
could
draw
up
an
argument
in
his
sermon
,
 
or
a
hole
in
his
breech
,
as
steadily
on
the
one
as
in
the
other
;
 
that
brisk
trotting
and
slow
argumentation
,
like
wit
and
judgment
,
be
two
incompatible
movement
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
upon
his
steed
 
he
could
unite
and
reconcile
every
thing
,
 
<EOS>
he
could
compose
his
sermon
 
<EOS>
he
could
compose
his
cough
,
 
and
,
in
case
nature
give
a
call
that
way
,
he
could
likewise
compose
himself
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
parson
upon
such
encounter
would
assign
any
cause
but
the
true
cause
,
 
and
he
with
-
hold
the
true
one
,
only
out
of
a
nicety
of
temper
,
because
he
think
it
do
honour
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
truth
of
the
story
be
as
follow
:
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
year
of
this
gentleman
's
life
,
and
about
the
time
when
the
superb
saddle
and
bridle
be
purchase
by
him
,
it
have
be
his
manner
,
or
vanity
,
or
call
it
what
you
will
,
 
to
run
into
the
opposite
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
language
of
the
county
where
he
dwell
,
he
be
say
to
have
love
a
good
horse
,
and
generally
have
one
of
the
good
in
the
whole
parish
stand
in
his
stable
always
ready
for
saddle
:
and
as
the
near
midwife
,
as
I
tell
you
,
do
not
live
near
to
the
village
than
seven
mile
,
and
in
a
vile
country
,
 
it
so
fall
out
that
the
poor
gentleman
be
scarce
a
whole
week
together
without
some
piteous
application
for
his
beast
;
and
as
he
be
not
an
unkind
-
hearted
man
,
and
every
case
be
more
pressing
and
more
distressful
than
the
last
;
 
as
much
as
he
love
his
beast
,
he
have
never
a
heart
to
refuse
him
;
the
upshot
of
which
be
generally
this
;
that
his
horse
be
either
clapp'd
,
or
spavin'd
,
or
greaz'd
;
 
or
he
be
twitter
-
bon'd
,
or
break
-
winded
,
or
something
,
in
short
,
or
other
have
befall
him
,
which
would
let
him
carry
no
flesh
;
 
so
that
he
have
every
nine
or
ten
month
<EOS>
a
bad
horse
to
get
rid
of
,
 
and
a
good
horse
to
purchase
in
his
stead
.
  
<EOS>
what
the
loss
in
such
a
balance
may
amount
to
,
communibus
annis
,
I
would
leave
to
a
special
jury
of
sufferer
in
the
same
traffick
,
to
determine
;
  
but
let
it
be
what
it
would
,
the
honest
gentleman
bear
it
for
many
year
without
a
murmur
,
till
at
length
,
by
repeat
ill
accident
of
the
kind
,
he
find
it
necessary
to
take
the
thing
under
consideration
;
and
upon
weigh
the
whole
,
and
sum
it
up
in
his
mind
,
he
find
it
not
only
disproportione
to
his
other
expence
,
but
withal
so
heavy
an
article
in
itself
,
as
to
disable
him
from
any
other
act
of
generosity
in
his
parish
:
 
<EOS>
besides
this
,
he
consider
that
with
half
the
sum
thus
gallop
away
,
he
could
do
ten
time
as
much
good
;
 
and
what
still
weigh
more
with
him
than
all
other
consideration
put
together
,
be
this
,
that
it
confine
all
his
charity
into
one
particular
channel
,
and
where
,
as
he
fancy
,
it
be
the
least
wanted
,
namely
,
to
the
child
-
bearing
and
child
-
get
part
of
his
parish
;
reserve
nothing
for
the
impotent
,
 
nothing
for
the
aged
,
 
nothing
for
the
many
comfortless
scene
he
be
hourly
call
forth
to
visit
,
where
poverty
,
and
sickness
and
affliction
dwelt
together
.
   
<EOS>
for
these
reason
he
resolve
to
discontinue
the
expence
;
and
there
appear
but
two
possible
way
to
extricate
him
clearly
out
of
it
;
 
and
these
be
,
either
to
make
it
an
irrevocable
law
never
more
to
lend
his
steed
upon
any
application
<EOS>
whatever
,
 
or
else
be
content
to
ride
the
last
poor
devil
,
such
as
they
have
make
him
,
with
all
his
ache
and
infirmity
,
to
the
very
end
of
the
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
dread
his
own
constancy
in
the
first
 
he
very
chearfully
betook
himself
to
the
second
;
and
though
he
could
very
well
have
explain
it
,
as
I
say
,
to
his
honour
,
 
yet
,
for
that
very
reason
,
he
have
a
spirit
above
it
;
choose
rather
to
bear
the
contempt
of
his
enemy
,
and
the
laughter
of
his
friend
,
than
undergo
the
pain
of
tell
a
story
,
which
may
seem
a
panegyrick
upon
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
high
idea
of
the
spiritual
and
refined
sentiment
of
this
reverend
gentleman
,
from
this
single
stroke
in
his
character
,
which
I
think
come
up
to
any
of
the
honest
refinement
of
the
peerless
knight
of
La
Mancha
,
whom
,
by
the
bye
,
with
all
his
folly
,
I
love
more
,
and
would
actually
have
go
farther
to
have
pay
a
visit
to
,
than
the
great
hero
of
antiquity
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
moral
of
my
story
:
 
<EOS>
the
thing
I
have
in
view
be
to
shew
the
temper
of
the
world
in
the
whole
of
this
affair
.
 
<EOS>
for
you
must
know
,
that
so
long
as
this
explanation
would
have
do
the
parson
credit
,
 
the
devil
a
soul
could
find
it
out
,
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
his
enemy
would
not
,
and
that
his
friend
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
do
he
bestir
himself
in
behalf
of
the
midwife
,
and
pay
the
expence
of
the
ordinary
's
licence
to
set
her
up
,
 
but
the
whole
secret
come
out
;
every
horse
he
have
lose
,
and
two
horse
more
than
ever
he
have
lose
,
with
all
the
circumstance
of
their
destruction
,
be
know
and
distinctly
remember
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
run
like
wild
-
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
parson
have
a
return
fit
of
pride

him

he

go

mount
once
again
in
his
life

and
if
it
be
so
,
'
twas
plain
as
the

day

he
would
pocket
the
expence
of

ten
time

the
very
first

:
 
so
that
every
body
be
leave
to
judge
what
be
his
view
in
this
act
of
charity

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
his
view
in
this
,
and
in
every
other
action
of
his
life
,
 
or
rather
what
be
the
opinion
which
float
in
the
brain
of
other
people
concern
it
,
be
a
thought
which
too
much
float
in
his
own
,
and
too
often
break
in
upon
his
rest
,
when
he
should
have
be
sound
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
about
ten
year
ago
this
gentleman
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
make
entirely
easy
upon
that
score
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
just
so
long
since
he
leave
his
parish
,
 
and
the
whole
world
at
the
same
time
behind
him
,
 
and
stand
accountable
to
a
Judge
of
whom
he
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
fatality
<EOS>
attend
the
action
of
some
man
:
 
<EOS>
order
them
as
they
will
,
they
pass
thro
'
a
certain
medium
,
which
so
twist
and
refract
them
from
their
true
direction
 
that
,
with
all
the
title
to
praise
which
a
rectitude
of
heart
can
give
,
the
doer
of
them
be
nevertheless
force
to
live
and
die
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
of
the
truth
of
which
,
this
gentleman
be
a
painful
example
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
know
by
what
mean
this
come
to
pass
,
 
and
to
make
that
knowledge
of
use
to
you
,
I
insist
upon
it
that
you
read
the
two
follow
chapter
,
which
contain
such
a
sketch
of
his
life
and
conversation
,
as
will
carry
its
moral
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
be
do
,
if
nothing
stop
us
in
our
way
,
we
will
go
on
with
the
midwife
.
    
<EOS>
Yorick
be
this
parson
's
name
,
and
,
what
be
very
remarkable
in
it
,
(
as
appear
from
a
most
ancient
account
of
the
family
,
write
upon
strong
vellum
,
and
now
in
perfect
preservation
)
<EOS>
it
have
be
exactly
so
spelt
for
near
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
within
an
ace
of
say
nine
hundred
year
;
 
but
<EOS>
I
would
not
shake
my
credit
in
tell
an
improbable
truth
,
however
indisputable
in
itself
,
 
and
therefore
I
shall
content
myself
with
only
say
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
exactly
so
spelt
,
without
the
least
variation
or
transposition
of
a
single
letter
,
for
I
do
not
know
how
long
;
which
be
more
than
I
would
venture
to
say
of
one
half
of
the
good
surname
in
the
kingdom
;
which
,
in
a
course
of
year
,
have
generally
undergo
as
many
chop
and
change
as
their
owner
.
 
<EOS>
have
this
be
owe
to
the
pride
,
or
to
the
shame
of
the
respective
proprietor
?
 
<EOS>
in
honest
truth
,
I
think
sometimes
to
the
one
,
and
sometimes
to
the
other
,
just
as
the
temptation
have
work
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
villainous
affair
it
be
,
and
will
one
day
so
blend
and
confound
us
all
together
,
that
no
one
shall
be
able
to
stand
up
and
swear
,
"
that
his
own
great
grandfather
be
the
man
who
do
either
this
or
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
evil
have
be
sufficiently
fence
against
by
the
prudent
care
of
the
Yorick
's
family
,
and
their
religious
preservation
of
these
record
I
quote
,
which
do
farther
inform
us
,
that
the
family
be
originally
of
danish
extraction
,
and
have
be
transplant
into
England
as
early
as
in
the
reign
of
Horwendillus
,
king
of
Denmark
,
in
whose
court
,
it
seem
,
an
ancestor
of
this
Mr.
Yorick
's
,
and
from
whom
he
be
lineally
descend
,
hold
a
considerable
post
to
the
day
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
of
what
nature
this
considerable
post
be
,
<EOS>
this
record
saith
not
;
 
<EOS>
it
only
add
,
that
,
for
near
two
century
,
it
have
be
totally
abolish
,
as
altogether
unnecessary
,
not
only
in
that
court
,
but
in
every
other
court
of
the
christian
world
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
often
come
into
my
head
,
that
this
post
could
be
no
other
than
that
of
the
king
's
chief
Jester
;
 
and
that
Hamlet
's
Yorick
,
in
our
Shakespeare
,
many
of
whose
play
,
you
know
,
be
found
upon
authenticate
fact
,
be
certainly
the
very
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
time
to
look
into
Saxo
-
Grammaticus
's
danish
history
,
to
know
the
certainty
of
this
;
 
but
if
you
have
leisure
,
and
can
easily
get
at
the
book
,
you
may
do
it
full
as
well
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
time
,
in
my
travel
through
Denmark
with
Mr.
Noddy
's
eld
son
,
whom
,
in
the
year
1741
,
I
accompany
as
governor
,
ride
along
with
him
at
a
prodigious
rate
thro
'
most
part
of
Europe
,
and
of
which
original
journey
perform
by
us
two
,
a
most
delectable
narrative
will
be
give
in
the
progress
of
this
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
time
,
I
say
,
and
that
be
all
,
to
prove
the
truth
of
an
observation
make
by
a
long
sojourner
in
that
country
;
  
namely
,
"
<EOS>
that
nature
be
neither
very
lavish
,
nor
be
she
very
stingy
in
her
gift
of
genius
and
capacity
to
its
inhabitant
;
 
but
,
like
a
discreet
parent
,
be
moderately
kind
to
them
all
;
observe
such
an
equal
tenor
in
the
distribution
of
her
favour
,
as
to
bring
them
,
in
those
point
,
pretty
near
to
a
level
with
each
other
;
so
that
you
will
meet
with
few
instance
in
that
kingdom
of
refined
part
;
but
a
great
deal
of
good
plain
houshold
understanding
amongst
all
rank
of
people
,
of
which
every
body
have
a
share
;
"
which
be
,
I
think
,
very
right
.
  
<EOS>
with
us
,
you
see
,
the
case
be
quite
different
:
 
<EOS>
we
be
all
up
and
down
in
this
matter
;
 
you
be
a
great
genius
;
 
or
'
tis
fifty
to
one
,
Sir
,
you
be
a
great
dunce
and
a
blockhead
;
 
not
that
there
be
a
total
want
of
intermediate
step
,
 
no
,
 
<EOS>
we
be
not
so
irregular
as
that
come
to
;
 
but
the
two
extreme
be
more
common
,
and
in
a
great
degree
in
this
unsettled
island
,
where
nature
,
in
her
gift
and
disposition
of
this
kind
,
be
most
whimsical
and
capricious
;
fortune
herself
not
be
more
so
in
the
bequest
of
her
good
and
chattel
than
she
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
that
ever
stagger
my
faith
in
regard
to
Yorick
's
extraction
,
who
,
by
what
I
can
remember
of
him
,
and
by
all
the
account
I
could
ever
get
of
him
,
seem
not
to
have
have
one
single
drop
of
danish
blood
in
his
whole
crasis
;
in
nine
hundred
year
,
it
may
possibly
have
all
run
out
:
 
I
will
not
philosophize
one
moment
with
you
about
it
;
for
happen
how
it
would
,
the
fact
be
this
:
 
that
instead
of
that
cold
phlegm
and
exact
regularity
of
sense
and
humour
,
you
would
have
look
for
,
in
one
so
extract
;
 
he
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
as
mercurial
and
sublimate
a
composition
,
 
as
heteroclite
a
creature
in
all
his
declension
;
 
with
as
much
life
and
whim
,
and
gaite
de
coeur
about
him
,
as
the
kindly
climate
could
have
engender
and
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
this
sail
,
poor
Yorick
carry
not
one
ounce
of
ballast
;
he
be
utterly
unpractised
in
the
world
;
and
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
six
,
know
just
about
as
well
how
to
steer
his
course
in
it
,
as
a
romping
,
unsuspicious
girl
of
thirteen
:
 
<EOS>
so
that
upon
his
first
setting
out
,
the
brisk
gale
of
his
spirit
,
as
you
will
imagine
,
run
him
foul
ten
time
in
a
day
of
somebody
's
tackling
;
and
as
the
grave
and
more
slow
-
paced
be
oftenest
in
his
way
,
 
you
may
likewise
imagine
,
'
twas
with
such
<EOS>
he
have
generally
the
ill
luck
to
get
the
most
entangle
.
 
<EOS>
for
aught
I
know
there
may
be
some
mixture
of
unlucky
wit
at
the
bottom
of
such
Fracas
:
 
<EOS>
for
,
to
speak
the
truth
,
Yorick
have
an
invincible
dislike
and
opposition
in
his
nature
to
gravity
;
 
not
to
gravity
as
such
;
 
for
where
gravity
be
want
,
he
would
be
the
most
grave
or
serious
of
mortal
man
for
day
and
week
together
;
 
but
he
be
an
enemy
to
the
affectation
of
it
,
and
declare
open
war
against
it
,
only
as
it
appear
a
cloak
for
ignorance
,
or
for
folly
:
 
and
then
,
whenever
it
fall
in
his
way
,
however
shelter
and
protect
,
he
seldom
give
it
much
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
sometimes
,
in
his
wild
way
of
talk
,
he
would
say
,
that
Gravity
be
an
errant
scoundrel
,
and
he
would
add
,
 
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
too
,
  
because
a
sly
one
;
and
that
he
verily
believe
,
more
honest
,
well
-
mean
people
be
bubble
out
of
their
good
and
money
by
it
in
one
twelve
-
month
,
than
by
pocket
-
picking
and
shop
-
lifting
in
seven
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
naked
temper
which
a
merry
heart
discover
,
he
would
say
there
be
no
danger
,
 
but
to
itself
:
 
whereas
the
very
essence
of
gravity
be
design
,
and
consequently
deceit
;
 
'
twas
a
taught
trick
to
gain
credit
of
the
world
for
more
sense
and
knowledge
than
a
man
be
worth
;
and
that
,
with
all
its
pretension
,
 
it
be
no
better
,
but
often
bad
,
than
what
a
french
wit
have
long
ago
define
it
,
 
viz
.
"
<EOS>
a
mysterious
carriage
of
the
body
to
cover
the
defect
of
the
mind
;
"
 
which
definition
of
gravity
,
Yorick
,
with
great
imprudence
,
would
say
,
deserve
to
be
write
in
letter
of
gold
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
plain
truth
,
he
be
a
man
unhackneyed
and
unpractised
in
the
world
,
and
be
altogether
as
indiscreet
and
foolish
on
every
other
subject
of
discourse
where
policy
be
will
not
to
impress
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
Yorick
have
no
impression
but
one
,
and
that
be
what
arise
from
the
nature
of
the
deed
spoken
of
;
which
impression
he
would
usually
translate
into
plain
English
without
any
periphrasis
;
 
and
too
oft
without
much
distinction
of
either
person
,
time
,
or
place
;
 
so
that
when
mention
be
make
of
a
pitiful
or
an
ungenerous
proceeding
 
<EOS>
he
never
give
himself
a
moment
's
time
to
reflect
who
be
the
hero
of
the
piece
,
 
what
his
station
,
 
or
how
far
he
have
power
to
hurt
him
hereafter
;
 
but
if
it
be
a
dirty
action
,
 
without
more
ado
,
 
the
man
be
a
dirty
fellow
,
 
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
his
comment
have
usually
the
ill
fate
to
be
terminate
either
in
a
bon
mot
,
or
to
be
enliven
throughout
with
some
drollery
or
humour
of
expression
,
it
give
wing
to
Yorick
's
indiscretion
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
tho
'
he
never
seek
,
yet
,
at
the
same
time
,
as
he
seldom
shun
occasion
of
say
what
come
uppermost
,
and
without
much
ceremony
;
 
he
have
but
too
many
temptation
in
life
,
of
scatter
his
wit
and
his
humour
,
 
his
gibe
and
his
jest
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
not
lose
for
want
of
gathering
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
consequence
,
and
what
be
Yorick
's
catastrophe
<EOS>
thereupon
,
you
will
read
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
the
Mortgager
and
Mortgagee
differ
the
one
from
the
other
,
not
more
in
length
of
purse
,
than
the
Jester
and
Jestee
do
,
in
that
of
memory
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
the
comparison
between
them
run
,
as
the
scholiast
call
it
,
upon
all-
four
;
which
,
by
the
bye
,
be
upon
one
or
two
leg
more
than
some
of
the
good
of
Homer
's
can
pretend
to
;
 
namely
,
that
the
one
raise
a
sum
,
and
the
other
a
laugh
at
your
expence
,
and
think
no
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
interest
,
however
,
still
run
on
in
both
case
;
 
the
periodical
or
accidental
payment
of
it
,
just
serve
to
keep
the
memory
of
the
affair
alive
;
till
,
at
length
,
in
some
evil
hour
,
pop
come
the
creditor
upon
each
,
and
by
demand
principal
upon
the
spot
,
together
with
full
interest
to
the
very
day
,
make
them
both
feel
the
full
extent
of
their
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
reader
(
for
I
hate
your
ifs
)
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
human
nature
,
I
need
not
say
more
to
satisfy
him
,
that
my
Hero
could
not
go
on
at
this
rate
without
some
slight
experience
of
these
incidental
memento
.
 
<EOS>
to
speak
the
truth
,
he
have
wantonly
involve
himself
in
a
multitude
of
small
book
-
debt
of
this
stamp
,
which
,
notwithstanding
Eugenius
's
frequent
advice
,
he
too
much
disregard
;
thinking
,
that
as
not
one
of
them
be
contract
thro
'
any
malignancy
;
 
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
from
an
honesty
of
mind
,
and
a
mere
jocundity
of
humour
,
they
would
all
of
them
be
cross'd
out
in
course
.
  
<EOS>
Eugenius
would
never
admit
this
;
and
would
often
tell
him
,
that
one
day
or
other
he
would
certainly
be
reckon
with
;
and
he
would
often
add
,
in
an
accent
of
sorrowful
apprehension
,
 
to
the
uttermost
mite
.
 
<EOS>
to
which
Yorick
,
with
his
usual
carelessness
of
heart
,
would
as
often
answer
with
a
pshaw
!
  
<EOS>
and
if
the
subject
be
start
in
the
field
,
 
with
a
hop
,
skip
,
and
a
jump
at
the
end
of
it
;
but
if
close
pen
up
in
the
social
chimney
-
corner
,
where
the
culprit
be
barricado'd
<EOS>
in
,
with
a
table
and
a
couple
of
arm
-
chair
,
and
could
not
so
readily
fly
off
in
a
tangent
,
 
Eugenius
would
then
go
on
with
his
lecture
upon
discretion
in
word
to
this
purpose
,
though
somewhat
better
put
together
.
  
<EOS>
trust
me
,
dear
Yorick
,
this
unwary
pleasantry
of
thine
will
sooner

<EOS>
in
these
sally
,
too
oft
,
I
see
,
it
happen
,
that
a
person
laugh
at
,
consider
himself
in
the
light
of
a
person
injure
,
with
all
the
right
of
such
a
situation
belong
to
him
;
and
when
thou
viewest
him
in
that
light
too
,
and
reckon
up
his
friend
,
his
family
,
his
kindred
and
ally
,
 
and
muster
up
with
them
the
many
recruit
which
will
list
under
him
from
a
sense
of
common
danger
;
 
'
tis
no
extravagant
arithmetic
to
say
,
that
for
every
ten
joke
,
 
thou
hast
get
an
hundred
enemy
;
and
till
thou
hast
go
on
,
and
raise
a
swarm
of
wasp
about
thine
ear
,
and
art
half
stung
to
death
by
them
,
thou
wilt
never
be
convince
it
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
suspect
it
in
the
man
whom
I
esteem
,
that
there
be
the
least
spur
from
spleen
or
malevolence
of
intent
in
these
sally
 
<EOS>
I
believe
and
know
them
to
be
truly
honest
and
sportive
:
 
but
consider
,
my
dear
lad
,
that
fool
can
not
distinguish
this
,
 
and
that
knave
will
not
:
 
and
thou
knowest
<EOS>
not
what
it
be
,
either
to
provoke
the
one
,
or
to
make
merry
with
the
other
:
 
<EOS>
whenever
they
associate
for
mutual
defence
,
depend
upon
it
,
they
will
carry
on
the
war
in
such
a
manner
against
thee
,
my
dear
friend
,
as
to
make
thee
heartily
sick
of
it
,
and
of
thy
life
too
.
  
<EOS>
revenge
from
some
baneful
corner
shall
level
a
tale
of
dishonour
at
thee
,
which
no
innocence
of
heart
or
integrity
of
conduct
shall
set
right
.
 
<EOS>
the
fortune
of
thy

shall
totter
,
 
thy

which

the

to
them

shall
bleed
on

thy

<EOS>
thy

<EOS>
to

up
the

,
Cruelty

Cowardice

twin

,
hire
and
set
on
by
Malice
in

Yorick
,
when
to
gratify
a
private
appetite
,
it
be
once
resolve
upon
,
that
an
innocent
and
an
helpless
creature
shall
be
sacrifice
,
'
tis
an
easy
matter
to
pick
up
stick
enough
from
any
thicket
where
it
have
stray
,
to
make
a
fire
to
offer
it
up
with
.
  
<EOS>
yorick
scarce
ever
hear
this
sad
vaticination
of
his
destiny
read
over
to
him
,
but
with
a
tear
steal
from
his
eye
,
and
a
promissory
look
attend
it
,
that
he
be
resolve
,
for
the
time
to
come
,
to
ride
his
tit
with
more
sobriety
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
,
too
late
!
 
<EOS>
a
grand
confederacy
with
.
.
<EOS>
.and
.
.
<EOS>
.at
<EOS>
the
head
of
it
,
be
form
before
the
first
prediction
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
plan
of
the
attack
,
just
as
Eugenius
have
forebode
,
be
put
in
execution
all
at
once
,
 
with
so
little
mercy
on
the
side
of
the
ally
,
 
and
so
little
suspicion
in
Yorick
,
of
what
be
carry
on
against
him
,
 
<EOS>
that
when
he
think
,
<EOS>
good
easy
man
!
<EOS>
full
surely
preferment
be
o'ripening
,
 
they
have
smite
his
root
,
and
then
he
fall
,
as
many
a
worthy
man
have
fall
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Yorick
,
however
,
fight
it
out
with
all
imaginable
gallantry
for
some
time
;
till
,
overpower
by
number
,
and
wear
out
at
length
by
the
calamity
of
the
war
,
 
but
more
so
,
by
the
ungenerous
manner
in
which
it
be
carry
on
,
 
he
throw
down
the
sword
;
and
though
he
keep
up
his
spirit
in
appearance
to
the
last
,
he
die
,
nevertheless
,
as
be
generally
think
,
quite
break
-
hearted
.
  
<EOS>
what
incline
Eugenius
to
the
same
opinion
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
a
few
hour
before
Yorick
breathe
his
last
,
Eugenius
stept
in
with
an
intent
to
take
his
last
sight
and
last
farewell
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
upon
his
draw
Yorick
's
curtain
,
and
ask
how
he
feel
himself
,
Yorick
look
up
in
his
face
take
hold
of
his
hand
,
 
and
after
thank
him
for
the
many
token
of
his
friendship
to
him
,
for
which
,
he
say
,
if
it
be
their
fate
to
meet
hereafter
,
 
he
would
thank
him
again
and
again
,
 
he
tell
him
,
he
be
within
a
few
hour
of
give
his
enemy
the
slip
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
answer
Eugenius
,
with
tear
trickle
down
his
cheek
,
and
with
the
tender
tone
that
ever
man
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
Yorick
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
Yorick
reply
,
with
a
look
up
,
and
a
gentle
squeeze
of
Eugenius
's
hand
,
and
that
be
all
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
cut
Eugenius
to
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
 
come
,
<EOS>
Yorick
,
quoth
Eugenius
,
wipe
his
eye
,
and
summon
up
the
man
within
him
,
 
my
dear
lad
,
be
comfort
,
 
let
not
all
thy
spirit
and
fortitude
forsake
thee
at
this
crisis
when
thou
most
want
them
;
 
who
know
what
resource
be
in
store
,
and
what
the
power
of
God
may
yet
do
for
thee
!
 
<EOS>
Yorick
lay
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
gently
shake
his
head
;
 
for
my
part
,
continue
Eugenius
,
cry
bitterly
as
he
utter
the
word
,
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
know
not
,
Yorick
,
how
to
part
with
thee
,
and
would
gladly
flatter
my
hope
,
add
Eugenius
,
cheare
up
his
voice
,
that
there
be
still
enough
leave
of
thee
to
make
a
bishop
,
and
that
I
may
live
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
beseech
thee
,
Eugenius
,
quoth
Yorick
,
take
off
his
night
-
cap
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
left
hand
,
 
his
right
being
still
grasp
close
in
that
of
Eugenius
,
 
I
beseech
thee
to
take
a
view
of
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
that
ail
it
,
reply
Eugenius
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
alas
!
<EOS>
my
friend
,
say
Yorick
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
'
tis
so
bruised
and
mis
-
shapene
with
the
blow
<EOS>
which
.
.
<EOS>
.and
.
.
.
,
and
some
other
have
so
unhandsomely
give
me
in
the
dark
,
that
I
may
say
with
Sancho
Panca
,
that
should
I
recover
,
and
"
mitre
thereupon
be
suffer
to
rain
down
from
heaven
as
thick
as
hail
,
not
one
of
them
would
fit
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Yorick
's
last
breath
be
hang
upon
his
tremble
lip
ready
to
depart
as
he
utter
this
:
 
yet
still
it
be
uttered
with
something
of
a
Cervantick
tone
;
 
and
as
he
speak
it
,
Eugenius
could
perceive
a
stream
of
lambent
fire
light
up
for
a
moment
in
his
eye
;
 
faint
picture
of
those
flash
of
his
spirit
,
which
(
as
Shakespeare
say
of
his
ancestor
)
be
will
not
to
set
the
table
in
a
roar
!
  
<EOS>
Eugenius
be
convince
from
this
,
that
the
heart
of
his
friend
be
break
:
 
<EOS>
he
squeeze
his
hand
,
 
and
then
walk
softly
out
of
the
room
,
weep
as
he
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Yorick
follow
Eugenius
with
his
eye
to
the
door
,
 
he
then
close
them
,
and
never
open
them
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
lie
bury
in
the
corner
of
his
church
-
yard
,
in
the
parish
of
.
.
.
<EOS>
,
under
a
plain
marble
slab
,
which
his
friend
Eugenius
,
by
leave
of
his
executor
,
lay
upon
his
grave
,
with
no
more
than
these
three
word
of
inscription
,
serve
both
for
his
epitaph
and
elegy
.
 
<EOS>
alas
,
poor
yorick
!
  
<EOS>
ten
time
a
day
have
Yorick
's
ghost
the
consolation
to
hear
his
monumental
inscription
read
over
with
such
a
variety
of
plaintive
tone
,
as
denote
a
general
pity
and
esteem
for
him
;
 
a
foot
-
way
cross
the
church
-
yard
close
by
the
side
of
his
grave
,
 
not
a
passenger
go
by
without
stop
to
cast
a
look
upon
it
,
 
and
sigh
as
he
walk
on
,
alas
,
poor
Yorick
!
    
<EOS>
It
be
so
long
since
the
reader
of
this
rhapsodical
work
have
be
part
from
the
midwife
,
that
it
be
high
time
to
mention
her
again
to
him
,
merely
to
put
him
in
mind
that
there
be
such
a
body
still
in
the
world
,
and
whom
,
upon
the
good
judgment
I
can
form
upon
my
own
plan
at
present
,
I
be
go
to
introduce
to
him
for
good
and
all
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
fresh
matter
may
be
start
,
and
much
unexpected
business
fall
out
betwixt
the
reader
and
myself
,
which
may
require
immediate
dispatch
;
 
'
twas
right
to
take
care
that
the
poor
woman
should
not
be
lose
in
the
mean
time
;
 
because
when
she
be
want
,
we
can
no
way
do
without
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
tell
you
that
this
good
woman
be
a
person
of
no
small
note
and
consequence
throughout
our
whole
village
and
township
;
 
that
her
fame
have
spread
itself
to
the
very
out
-
edge
and
circumference
of
that
circle
of
importance
,
of
which
kind
every
soul
live
,
whether
he
have
a
shirt
to
his
back
or
no
<EOS>
,
 
have
one
surround
him
;
 
which
say
circle
,
by
the
way
,
whenever
'
tis
say
that
such
a
one
be
of
great
weight
and
importance
in
the
world
,
 
I
desire
may
be
enlarge
or
contract
in
your
worship
's
fancy
,
in
a
compound
ratio
of
the
station
,
profession
,
knowledge
,
ability
,
height
and
depth
(
measure
both
way
)
of
the
personage
bring
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
present
case
,
if
I
remember
,
I
fix
it
about
four
or
five
mile
,
which
not
only
comprehend
the
whole
parish
,
but
extend
itself
to
two
or
three
of
the
adjacent
hamlet
in
the
skirt
of
the
next
parish
;
which
make
a
considerable
thing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
add
,
<EOS>
that
she
be
,
moreover
,
very
well
look
on
at
one
large
grange
-
house
,
and
some
other
odd
house
and
farm
within
two
or
three
mile
,
as
I
say
,
from
the
smoke
of
her
own
chimney
:
  
<EOS>
but
I
must
here
,
once
for
all
,
inform
you
,
that
all
this
will
be
more
exactly
delineate
and
explain'd
in
a
map
,
now
in
the
hand
of
the
engraver
,
which
,
with
many
other
piece
and
developement
of
this
work
,
will
be
add
to
the
end
of
the
twentieth
volume
,
 
not
to
swell
the
work
,
  
<EOS>
I
detest
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
;
 
but
by
way
of
commentary
,
scholium
,
illustration
,
and
key
to
such
passage
,
incident
,
or
inuendo
as
shall
be
think
to
be
either
of
private
interpretation
,
or
of
dark
or
doubtful
meaning
,
after
my
life
and
my
opinion
shall
have
be
read
over
(
now
do
not
 
forget
the
meaning
of
the
word
)
by
all
the
world
;
 
which
,
betwixt
you
and
me
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
gentleman
-
reviewer
in
Great
Britain
,
and
of
all
that
their
worship
shall
undertake
to
write
or
say
to
the
contrary
,
 
I
be
determine
shall
be
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
your
worship
,
that
all
this
be
speak
in
confidence
.
    
<EOS>
upon
look
into
my
mother
's
marriage
settlement
,
in
order
to
satisfy
myself
and
reader
in
a
point
necessary
to
be
clear
up
,
before
we
could
proceed
any
farther
in
this
history
;
 
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
pop
upon
the
very
thing
I
want
before
I
have
read
a
day
and
a
half
straight
forwards
,
 
it
may
have
take
me
up
a
month
;
 
which
shew
plainly
,
that
when
a
man
sit
down
to
write
a
history
,
 
tho
'
it
be
but
the
history
of
Jack
Hickathrift
or
Tom
Thumb
<EOS>
,
he
know
no
more
than
his
heel
<EOS>
what
let
and
confound
hindrance
he
be
to
meet
with
in
his
way
,
 
or
what
a
dance
<EOS>
he
may
be
lead
,
by
one
excursion
or
another
,
before
all
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
Could
a
historiograph
drive
on
his
history
,
as
a
muleteer
drive
on
his
mule
,
  
straight
forward
;
 
for
instance
,
from
Rome
all
the
way
to
Loretto
,
without
ever
once
turn
his
head
aside
,
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
,
 
he
may
venture
to
foretell
you
to
an
hour
when
he
should
get
to
his
journey
's
end
;
 
but
the
thing
be
,
morally
speak
,
impossible
:
 
for
,
if
he
be
a
man
of
the
least
spirit
,
he
will
have
fifty
deviation
from
a
straight
line
to
make
with
this
or
that
party
as
he
go
along
,
which
he
can
no
way
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
have
view
and
prospect
to
himself
perpetually
solicit
his
eye
,
which
he
can
no
more
help
stand
still
to
look
at
than
he
can
fly
;
he
will
moreover
have
various
 
account
to
reconcile
:
  
<EOS>
anecdote
to
pick
up
:
  
<EOS>
inscription
to
make
out
:
  
story
to
weave
in
:
  
tradition
to
sift
:
  
<EOS>
personage
to
call
upon
:
  
panegyrick
to
paste
up
at
this
door
;
  
pasquinade
at
that
:
 
all
which
both
the
man
and
his
mule
be
quite
exempt
from
.
 
<EOS>
to
sum
up
all
;
there
be
archive
at
every
stage
to
be
look'd
into

endless
genealogy

<EOS>
in
short
there
be
no

of
it
;
 
for
my

<EOS>

I
declare
I

by
the
way

be
no
more
than
what
be
reasonable

yet
,
as
reasonable
as
it
be

I
have
ever
think
it
hard
that
the
whole
weight
of
the
article
should
have
fall
entirely
,
as
it
do

upon

I
be
beget

misfortune

my
poor
mother

whether
it
be
wind

water
 
or
a
compound
of
both
,
 
or
neither
;
 
or
whether
it
be
simply
the
mere
swell
of
imagination

fancy
in
her
;

how
far
a
strong
wish

desire

have
it
so

whether

fact

this

that
in

end

the
year
before
I
be

my

have
carry
my

much
against

peremptorily
insist

the
clause

that
I

by

have
my
nose
squeez'd

how
this

a

vexatious
disappointment

naturally
imagine

come
down
with
my

the
country

in

a
pettish
kind
of
a
humour

<EOS>
the
first
twenty
or
five-
and
-
twenty
mile
he
do
nothing
in
the
world
but
fret
and
teaze
himself
,
and
indeed
my
mother
too
,
about
the
curse
expence
,
which
he
say
may
every
shilling
of
it
have
be
save
;
 
then
what
vex
him
more
than
<EOS>
every
thing
else
be
,
the
provoking
time
of
the
year
,
 
which
,
as
I
tell
you
,
be
towards
the
end
of
September
,
when
his
wall
-
fruit
and
green
gage
especially
,
in
which
he
be
very
curious

be
just
ready
for
pull

be
whistle
up

<EOS>
in

other
month
of
the
whole
year

he
should
not
have
say
three
word
about
it

"
  
<EOS>
for
the
next
two
whole
stage

no
subject
would
go
down
,
but
the
heavy
blow
he
have
sustain'd
from
the
loss
of
a
son
,
whom
it
seem
he
have
fully
reckon'd
upon
in
his
mind
,
and
register'd
down
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
as
a
second
staff
for
his
old
age
,
in
case
Bobby
should
fail
him

<EOS>
"
the
disappointment
of
this
,
he
say
,
be
ten
time
more
to
a
wise
man
,
than
all
the
money
which
the
journey
,
&
c.
have
cost
him
,
put
together
,
 
rot
the
hundred

twenty
pound

<EOS>
he
do
not
mind
it
a
rush

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
from
Stilton
,
all
the
way
to
Grantham
,
nothing
in
the
whole
affair
provoke
him
so
much
as
the
condolence
of
his
friend
,
and
the
foolish
figure
they
should
both
make
at
church
,
the
first
Sunday
;
 
of
which
,
in
the
satirical
vehemence
of
his
wit
,
now
sharpen'd
a
little
by
vexation
,
he
would
give
so
many
humorous
and
provoking
description
,
 
and
place
his
rib
and
self
in
so
many
torment
light
and
attitude
in
the
face
of
the
whole
congregation
;
 
that
my
mother
declare
,
these
two
stage
be
so
truly
tragi
-
comical
,
that
she
do
nothing
but
laugh
and
cry
in
a
breath
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
them
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
from
Grantham
,
till
they
have
cross'd
<EOS>
the
Trent
,
my
father
be
out
of
all
kind
of
patience
at
the
vile
trick
and
imposition
which
he
fancy
my
mother
have
put
upon
him
in
this
affair
 
"
certainly
,
"
he
would
say
to
himself
,
over
and
over
again
,
"
the
woman
could
not
be
deceive
herself
 
if
she
could
,
 
what
weakness
!
"
 
<EOS>
torment
word
!
 
<EOS>
which
lead
his
imagination
a
thorny
dance
,
and
,
before
all
be
over
,
play'd
<EOS>
the
duce
and
all
with
him
;
  
for
sure
as
ever
<EOS>
the
word
weakness
be
utter
,
and
strike
full
upon
his
brain
 
so
sure
it
set
him
upon
running
division
upon
how
many
kind
of
weakness
there
be
;
 
that
there
be
such
a
thing
as
weakness
of
the
body
,
 
as
well
as
weakness
of
the
mind
,
 
and
then
he
would
do
nothing
but
syllogize
within
himself
for
a
stage
or
two
together
,
<EOS>
how
far
the
cause
of
all
these
vexation
may
,
or
may
not
,
have
arise
out
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
have
so
many
little
subject
of
disquietude
spring
out
of
this
one
affair
,
all
fret
successively
in
his
mind
as
they
rise
up
in
it
,
that
my
mother
,
whatever
be
her
journey
up
,
have
but
an
uneasy
journey
of
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
as
she
complain
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
he
would
have
tire
out
the
patience
of
any
flesh
alive
.
     
<EOS>
though
my
father
travel
homeward
,
as
I
tell
you
,
in
none
of
the
good
of
mood
,
 
pshawe
and
pishe
all
the
way
down
,
 
yet
he
have
the
complaisance
to
keep
the
bad
part
of
the
story
still
to
himself
;
 
which
be
the
resolution
he
have
take
of
do
himself
the
justice
,
which
my
uncle
Toby
's
clause
in
the
marriage
-
settlement
empower
him
;
nor
be
it
till
the
very
night
in
which
I
be
beget
,
which
be
thirteen
month
after
,
that
she
have
the
least
intimation
of
his
design
:
 
when
my

as
you
remember
,
to
be
a
little
chagrin'd
and
out
of

occasion
as
they
lie
chat
gravely
in
bed
afterwards

talk
over
what
be
to
come
,
 
to
let
her
know
that
she
must
accommodate
herself
as
well
as
she
could
to
the
bargain
make
between
them
in
their
marriage

deed

which
be

in
of
her
next
child
in
the

to
balance
the
last
year
's
journey

<EOS>
My
father
be
a
gentleman
of
many
virtue
,
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
a
strong
spice
of
that
in
his
temper
,
which
may
,
or
may
not
,
add
to
the
number
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
know
by
the
name
of
perseverance
in
a
good
cause
,
 
and
of
obstinacy
in
a
bad
one
:
 
of
this
my
mother
have
so
much
knowledge
,
that
she
know
'
twas
to
no
purpose
to
make
any
remonstrance
,
 
<EOS>
so
she
e'en
resolve
to
sit
down
quietly
,
and
make
the
most
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
as
the
point
be
that
night
agree
,
or
rather
determined
,
that
my
mother
should
lye
-
in
of
me
in
the
country
,
she
take
her
measure
accordingly
;
for
which
purpose
,
when
she
be
three
day
,
or
thereabout
,
go
with
child
<EOS>
,
she
begin
to
cast
her
eye
upon
the
midwife
,
whom
you
have
so
often
hear
me
mention
;
and
before
the
week
be
well
get
round
,
as
the
famous
Dr.
Manningham
be
not
to
be
have
,
she
have
come
to
a
final
determination
in
her
mind
,
 
notwithstanding
<EOS>
there
be
a
scientific
operator
within
so
near
a
call
as
eight
mile
of
us
,
and
who
,
moreover
,
have
expressly
write
a
five
shilling
book
upon
the
subject
of
midwifery
,
in
which
he
have
expose
,
not
only
the
blunder
of
the
sisterhood
itself
,
 
but
have
likewise
super
-
add
many
curious
improvement
for
the
quick
extraction
of
the
foetus
in
cross
birth
,
and
some
other
case
of
danger
,
which
belay
us
in
get
into
the
world
;
notwithstanding
all
this
,
my
mother
,
I
say
,
be
absolutely
determine
to
trust
her
life
,
and
mine
with
it
,
into
no
soul
's
hand
but
this
old
woman
's
only
.
 
<EOS>
now
this
I
like
;
 
when
we
can
not
get
at
the
very
thing
we
wish
 
never
to
take
up
with
the
next
good
in
degree
to
it
:
 
no
<EOS>
;
that
be
pitiful
beyond
description
;
 
it
be
no
more
than
a
week
from
this
very
day
,
in
which
I
be
now
write
this
book
for
the
edification
of
the
world
;
 
which
be
March
9
,
1759
,
 
that
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
,
observe
I
look
a
little
grave
,
as
she
stand
cheapen
a
silk
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
shilling
a
yard
,
 
tell
the
mercer
,
she
be
sorry
she
have
give
him
so
much
trouble
;
 
and
immediately
go
and
buy
herself
a
yard
-
wide
stuff
of
ten-
pence
a
yard
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
the
duplication
of
one
and
the
same
greatness
of
soul
;
only
what
lessen
the
honour
of
it
,
somewhat
,
in
my
mother
's
case
,
be
,
that
she
could
not
heroine
it
into
so
violent
and
hazardous
an
extreme
,
as
one
in
her
situation
may
have
wish
,
because
the
old
midwife
have
really
some
little
claim
to
be
depend
upon
,
 
as
much
,
at
least
,
as
success
could
give
her
;
have
,
in
the
course
of
her
practice
of
near
twenty
year
in
the
parish
,
bring
every
mother
's
son
of
them
into
the
world
without
any
one
slip
or
accident
which
could
fairly
be
lay
to
her
account
.
  
<EOS>
these
fact
,
tho
'
<EOS>
they
have
their
weight
,
yet
do
not
altogether
satisfy
some
few
scruple
and
uneasiness
which
hang
upon
my
father
's
spirit
in
relation
to
this
choice
.
 
<EOS>
to
say
nothing
of
the
natural
working
of
humanity
and
justice
 
or
of
the
yearning
of
parental
and
connubial
love
,
all
which
prompt
him
to
leave
as
little
to
hazard
as
possible
in
a
case
of
this
kind
;
 
he
feel
himself
concerned
in
a
particular
manner
,
that
all
should
go
right
in
the
present
case
;
 
from
the
accumulate
sorrow
he
lie
open
to
,
should
any
evil
betide
his
wife
and
child
in
lying
-
in
at
Shandy-
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
the
world
judge
by
event
,
and
would
add
to
his
affliction
in
such
a
misfortune
,
by
load
him
with
the
whole
blame
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
alas
o'day
;
 
have
Mrs.
Shandy
,
poor
gentlewoman
!
<EOS>
have
but
her
wish
in
go
up
to
town
just
to
lye
-
in
and
come
down
again
;
 
<EOS>
which
they
say
,
she
beg
and
pray
for
upon
her
bare
knee
,
 
and
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
consider
the
fortune
which
Mr.
Shandy
get
with
her
,
 
be
no
such
mighty
matter
to
have
comply
with
,
the
lady
and
her
babe
may
both
of
them
have
be
alive
at
this
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
exclamation
,
my
father
know
,
be
unanswerable
;
 
and
yet
,
it
be
not
merely
to
shelter
himself
,
 
nor
be
it
altogether
for
the
care
of
his
offspring
and
wife
that
he
seem
so
extremely
anxious
about
this
point
<EOS>
;
  
my
father
have
extensive
view
of
thing
,
 
and
stand
moreover
,
as
he
think
,
deeply
concerned
in
it
for
the
publick
good
,
from
the
dread
he
entertain
of
the
bad
use
an
ill
-
fate
instance
may
be
put
to
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
very
sensible
that
all
political
writer
upon
the
subject
have
unanimously
agree
and
lament
,
from
the
beginning
of
Queen
Elizabeth
's
reign
down
to
his
own
time
,
that
the
current
of
man
and
money
towards
the
metropolis
,
upon
one
frivolous
errand
or
another
,
 
set
in
so
strong
,
 
as
to
become
dangerous
to
our
civil
right
,
 
though
,
by
the
bye
,
 
a
current
be
not
the
image
he
take
most
delight
in
,
 
a
distemper
be
here
his
favourite
metaphor
,
and
he
would
run
it
down
into
a
perfect
allegory
,
by
maintain
it
be
identically
the
same
in
the
body
national
as
in
the
body
natural
,
where
the
blood
and
spirit
be
drive
up
into
the
head
faster
than
they
could
find
their
way
down
;
 
a
stoppage
of
circulation
must
ensue
,
which
be
death
in
both
case
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
little
danger
,
he
would
say
,
of
lose
our
liberty
by
french
politick
or
french
invasion
;
 
nor
be
he
so
much
in
pain
of
a
consumption
from
the
mass
of
corrupted
matter
and
ulcerated
humour
in
our
constitution
,
which
he
hope
be
not
so
bad
as
it
be
imagine
;
 
but
he
verily
fear
,
that
in
some
violent
push
,
we
should
go
off
,
all
at
once
,
in
a
state
-
apoplexy
;
 
and
then
he
would
say
,
the
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
never
able
to
give
the
history
of
this
distemper
,
 
without
the
remedy
along
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
I
an
absolute
prince
,
"
he
would
say
,
pull
up
his
breech
with
both
his
hand
,
as
he
rise
from
his
arm
-
chair
,
"
I
would
appoint
able
judge
,
at
every
avenue
of
my
metropolis
,
who
should
take
cognizance
of
every
fool
's
business
who
come
there
;
 
and
if
,
upon
a
fair
and
candid
hearing
,
it
appear
not
of
weight
sufficient
to
leave
his
own
home
,
and
come
up
,
bag
and
baggage
,
with
his
wife
and
child
,
farmer
's
son
,
&
c.
&
c.
at
his
backside
,
they
should
be
all
send
back
,
from
constable
to
constable
,
like
vagrant
as
they
be
,
to
the
place
of
their
legal
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
means
I
shall
take
care
,
that
my
metropolis
totter'd
not
thro
"
its
own
weight
;
 
that
the
head
be
no
longer
too
big
for
the
body
;
 
that
the
extreme
,
now
waste
and
pinn'd
in
,
be
restore
to
their
due
share
of
nourishment
,
and
regain
with
it
their
natural
strength
and
beauty
:
 
<EOS>
I
would
effectually
provide
,
that
the
meadow
and
corn
field
of
my
dominion
,
should
laugh
and
sing
;
 
that
good
chear
and
hospitality
flourish
once
more
;
 
and
that
such
weight
and
influence
be
put
thereby
into
the
hand
of
the
Squirality
of
my
kingdom
,
as
should
counterpoise
what
I
perceive
<EOS>
my
nobility
be
now
take
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
there
so
few
palace
and
gentleman
's
seat
,
"
he
would
ask
,
with
some
emotion
,
as
he
walk
across
the
room
,
"
throughout
so
many
delicious
province
in
France
?
 
<EOS>
Whence
be
it
that
the
few
remain
Chateaus
amongst
them
be
so
dismantle
,
 
so
unfurnished
,
and
in
so
ruinous
and
desolate
a
condition
?
 
<EOS>
because
,
Sir
"
(
he
would
say
)
"
in
that
kingdom
no
man
have
any
country

interest
to
support

the
little
interest
of
any
kind
which
any
man
have
any
where
in
it

be
concentrate
in
the
court
,
and
the
look
of
the
Grand
Monarch
:
 
by
the
sunshine
of
whose
countenance
,
or
the
cloud
which
pass
across
it
,
every
french
man
live
or
die
.
"
  
<EOS>
another
political
reason
which
prompt
my
father
so
strongly
to
guard
against
the
least
evil
accident
in
my
mother
's
lying
-
in
in
the
country
,
  
be
,
that
any
such
instance
would
infallibly
throw
a
balance
of
power
,
too
great
already
,
into
the
weak
vessel
of
the
gentry
,
in
his
own
,
or
high
station
;
 
which
,
with
the
many
other
usurped
right
which
that
part
of
the
constitution
be
hourly
establish
,
 
would
,
in
the
end
,
prove
fatal
to
the
monarchical
system
of
domestick
government
establish
in
the
first
creation
of
thing
by
God
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
point
he
be
entirely
of
Sir
Robert
Filmer
's
opinion
,
that
the
plan
and
institution
of
the
great
monarchy
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
world
,
be
,
originally
,
all
steal
from
that
admirable
pattern
and
prototype
of
this
houshold
and
paternal
power
;
 
which
,
for
a
century
,
he
say
,
and
more
,
have
gradually
be
degenerate
away
into
a
mix'd
government
;
 
<EOS>
the
form
of
which
,
however
desirable
in
great
combination
of
the
specie
,
 
be
very
troublesome
in
small
one
,
 
and
seldom
produce
any
thing
,
that
he
see
,
but
sorrow
and
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
for
all
these
reason
,
private
and
publick
,
put
together
,
 
my
father
be
for
have
the
man
-
midwife
by
all
mean
,
 
my
mother
,
by
no
mean
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
begg'd
and
intreate
,
she
would
for
once
recede
from
her
prerogative
in
this
matter
,
and
suffer
him
to
choose
for
her
;
 
my
mother
,
on
the
contrary
,
insist
upon
her
privilege
in
this
matter
,
to
choose
for
herself
,
 
and
have
no
mortal
's
help
but
<EOS>
the
old
woman
's
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
my
father
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
almost
at
his
wit
's
end
;
 
talk
it
over
with
her
in
all
mood
;
 
place
his
argument
in
all
light
;
 
argue
the
matter
with
her
like
a
christian
,
 
like
a
heathen
,
 
like
a
husband
,
 
like
a
father
,
 
like
a
patriot
,
 
like
a
man
:
 
<EOS>
My
mother
answer
every
thing
only
like
a
woman
;
which
be
a
little
hard
upon
her
;
 
for
as
she
could
not
assume
and
fight
it
out
behind
such
a
variety
of
character
,
 
'
twas
no
fair
match
:
 
'
twas
seven
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
my
mother
do
?
 
<EOS>
She
have
the
advantage
(
otherwise
she
have
be
certainly
overpower
)
of
a
small
reinforcement
of
chagrin
personal
at
the
bottom
,
which
bear
her
up
,
and
enable
her
to
dispute
the
affair
with
my
father
with
so
equal
an
advantage
,
 
that
both
side
sing
Te
Deum
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
my
mother
be
to
have
the
old
woman
,
 
and
<EOS>
the
operator
be
to
have
licence
to
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
with
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
Shandy
in
the
back
parlour

which
he
be

five
guinea

<EOS>
I
must
beg
leave
,
before
I
finish
this
chapter
,
to
enter
a
caveat
in
the
breast
of
my
fair
reader
;
 
and
it
be
this
,
 
not
to
take
it
absolutely
for
grant
,
from
an
unguarded
word
or
two
which
I
have
dropp'd
<EOS>
in
it
,
 
"
that
I
be
a
married
man

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
own

the
tender
appellation

my

with
some
other
stroke
of
conjugal
knowledge

intersperse
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
may
,
naturally
enough
,
have
mislead
the
most
candid
judge
in
the
world
into
such
a
determination
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
plead
for
,
in
this
case
,
Madam

be
strict
justice
,
and
that
you
do
so
much
of
it
,
to
me
as
well
as
to
yourself
,
 
as
not
to
prejudge
,
or
receive
such
an
impression
of
me

till
you
have
well
evidence

than
,
I
be
positive

at

can
be
produce
against

<EOS>
not
that
I
can
be
so
vain

unreasonable

<EOS>
Madam

as
to
desire
you
should
therefore
think
,
that
my
dear

dear
Jenny
be
my
keep
mistress
;
  
no
,
 
that
would
be
flatter
my
character
in
the
other
extreme
,
and
give
it
an
air
of
freedom
,
which
,
perhaps
,
it
have
no
kind
of
right
to
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
contend
for
,
be
the
utter
impossibility
,
for
some
volume
,
that
you
,
or
the
most
penetrating
spirit
upon
earth

should
know
how
this
matter
really
stand

<EOS>
It
be
not
impossible

that
my

<EOS>
tender
as

may
be
my

Mr.

let
me
intreat
you
to
study
the
pure
and
sentimental
part
of
the
good
french
Romances
;
 
it
will
really
,
Madam
,
astonish
you
to
see
with
what
a
variety
of
chaste
expression
this
delicious
sentiment
,
which
I
have
the
honour
to
speak
of
,
be
dress'd
out
.
    
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
undertake
to
explain
the
hard
problem
in
geometry
,
than
pretend
to
account
for
it
,
that
a
gentleman
of
my
father
's
great
good
sense
,
 
knowing
,
as
the
reader
must
have
observe
him
,
and
curious
too
in
philosophy
,
 
wise
also
in
political
reasoning
,
 
and
in
polemical
(
as
he
will
find
)
no
way
ignorant
,
 
could
be
capable
of
entertain
a
notion
in
his
head
,
so
out
of
the
common
track
,
 
that
I
fear
the
reader
,
when
I
come
to
mention
it
to
him
,
if
he
be
the
least
of
a
cholerick
temper
,
will
immediatly
throw
the
book
by
;
if
mercurial
,
he
will
laugh
most
heartily
at
it
;
 
and
if
he
be
of
a
grave
and
saturnine
<EOS>
cast
,
he
will
,
at
first
sight
,
absolutely
condemn
as
fanciful
and
extravagant
;
and
that
be
in
respect
to
the
choice
and
imposition
of
christian
name
,
on
which
he
think
a
great
deal
more
depended
than
what
superficial
mind
be
capable
of
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
His
opinion
,
in
this
matter
,
be
,
that
there
be
a
strange
kind
of
magick
bias
,
which
good
or
bad
name
,
as
he
call
them
,
irresistibly
impress
upon
our
character
and
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
the
hero
of
Cervantes
argue
not
the
point
with
more
seriousness
,
 
nor
have
he
more
faith
,
 
or
more
to
say
on
the
power
of
necromancy
in
dishonour
his
deed
,
 
or
on
Dulcinea
's
name
,
in
shedding
lustre
upon
them
,
than
my
father
have
on
those
of
Trismegistus
or
Archimedes
,
on
the
one
hand
 
or
of
Nyky
and
Simkin
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
Caesars
and
Pompeys
,
he
would
say
,
by
mere
inspiration
of
the
name
,
have
be
render
worthy
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
many
,
he
would
add
,
be
there
,
who
may
have
do
exceed
well
in
the
world
,
have
not
their
character
and
spirit
be
totally
depressed
and
Nicodemus'd
into
nothing
?
  
<EOS>
I
see
plainly
,
Sir
,
by
your
look
,
(
or
as
the
case
happen
)
<EOS>
my
father
would
say
 
that
you
do
not
heartily
subscribe
to
this
opinion
of
mine
,
  
which
,
to
those
,
he
would
add
,
who
have
not
carefully
sift
it
to
the
bottom
,
 
<EOS>
I
own
have
an
air
more
of
fancy
than
of
solid
reasoning
in
it
;
 
and
yet
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Sir
,
if
I
may
presume
to
know
your
character
,
I
be
morally
assure
,
I
should
hazard
little
in
state
a
case
to
you
,
not
as
a
party
in
the
dispute
,
 
but
as
a
judge
,
and
trust
my
appeal
upon
it
to
your
own
good
sense
and
candid
disquisition
in
this
matter
;
 
you
be
a
person
free
from
as
many
narrow
prejudice
of
education
as
most
man
;
 
and
,
if
I
may
presume
to
penetrate
farther
into
you
,
 
of
a
liberality
of
genius
above
bear
down
an
opinion
,
merely
because
it
want
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Your
son
,
 
your
dear
son
,
 
from
whose
sweet
and
open
temper
you
have
so
much
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
Your
Billy
,
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
would
you
,
for
the
world
,
have
call
him
Judas
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
,
my
dear
Sir
,
he
would
say
,
lay
his
hand
upon
your
breast
,
with
the
genteel
address
,
 
and
in
that
soft
and
irresistible
piano
of
voice
,
which
the
nature
of
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
absolutely
require
<EOS>
,
 
Would
you
,
Sir
,
if
a
Jew
of
a
godfather
have
propose
the
name
for
your
child
,
and
offer
you
his
purse
along
with
it
,
would
you
have
consent
to
such
a
desecration
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
o
my
God
!
<EOS>
he
would
say
,
look
up
,
if
I
know
your
temper
<EOS>
right
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
 
you
be
incapable
of
it
;
 
you
would
have
trample
upon
the
offer
;
 
you
would
have
throw
the
temptation
at
the
tempter
's
head
with
abhorrence
.
  
<EOS>
Your
greatness
of
mind
in
this
action
,
which
I
admire
,
with
that
generous
contempt
of
money
,
which
you
shew
me
in
the
whole
transaction
,
be
really
noble
;
 
and
what
render
it
more
so
,
be
the
principle
of
it
;
 
the
working
of
a
parent
's
love
upon
the
truth
and
conviction
of
this
very
hypothesis
,
namely
,
that
be
your
son
call
Judas
,
 
<EOS>
the
forbid
and
treacherous
idea
,
so
inseparable
from
the
name
,
would
have
accompany
him
through
life
like
his
shadow
,
and
,
in
the
end
,
make
a
miser
and
a
rascal
of
him
,
in
spite
,
Sir
,
of
your
example
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
know
a
man
able
to
answer
this
argument
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
to
speak
of
my
father
as
he
be
;
 
he
be
certainly
irresistible
;
 
both
in
his
oration
and
disputation
;
 
he
be
bear
an
orator
;
 
(
Greek
)
.
 
<EOS>
Persuasion
hang
upon
his
lip
,
and
the
element
of
Logick
and
Rhetorick
be
so
blend
up
in
him
,
 
and
,
withal
,
he
have
so
shrewd
a
guess
at
the
weakness
and
passion
of
his
respondent
,
 
that
Nature
may
have
stand
up
and
say
,
 
"
this
man
be
eloquent
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
whether
he
be
on
the
weak
or
the
strong
side
of
the
question
,
'
twas
hazardous
in
either
case
to
attack
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
'
tis
strange
,
he
have
never
read
Cicero
,
nor
Quintilian
de
Oratore
,
nor
Isocrates
,
nor
Aristotle
,
nor
Longinus
,
amongst
the
antient
;
 
nor
Vossius
,
nor
Skioppius
,
nor
Ramus
,
nor
Farnaby
,
amongst
the
modern
;
 
and
what
be
more
astonishing
,
he
have
never
in
his
whole
life
the
least
light
or
spark
of
subtilty
strike
into
his
mind
,
by
one
single
lecture
upon
Crackenthorp
or
Burgersdicius
or
any
dutch
logician
or
commentator
;
 
he
know
not
so
much
as
in
what
the
difference
of
an
argument
ad
ignorantiam
,
and
an
argument
ad
hominem
consist
;
so
that
I
well
remember
,
when
he
go
up
along
with
me
to
enter
my
name
at
Jesus
College
in
.
.
.
<EOS>
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
matter
of
just
wonder
with
my
worthy
tutor
,
and
two
or
three
fellow
of
that
learn
society
,
  
that
a
man
who
know
not
so
much
as
the
name
of
his
tool
,
should
be
able
to
work
after
that
fashion
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
work
with
them
in
the
good
manner
he
could
,
be
what
my
father
be
,
however
,
perpetually
force
upon
;
 
for
he
have
a
thousand
little
sceptical
notion
of
the
comick
kind
to
defend
 
most
of
which
notion
,
I
verily
believe
,
at
first
enter
upon
the
footing
of
mere
whim
,
and
of
a
vive
la
Bagatelle
;
and
as
such
he
would
make
merry
with
them
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
and
have
sharpen
his
wit
upon
them
,
dismiss
them
till
another
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
mention
this
,
not
only
as
matter
of
hypothesis
or
conjecture
upon
the
progress
and
establishment
of
my
father
's
many
odd
opinion
,
 
<EOS>
but
as
a
warning
to
the
learned
reader
against
the
indiscreet
reception
of
such
guest
,
who
,
after
a
free
and
undisturbed
entrance
,
for
some
year
,
into
our
brain
,
 
at
length
claim
a
kind
of
settlement
there
,
 
work
sometimes
like
yeast
;
 
but
more
generally
after
the
manner
of
the
gentle
passion
,
begin
in
jest
,
 
but
end
in
downright
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
whether
this
be
the
case
of
the
singularity
of
my
father
's
notion
 
or
that
his
judgment
,
at
length
,
become
the
dupe
of
his
wit
;
 
or
how
far
,
in
many
of
his
notion
,
he
may
,
though
odd
,
be
absolutely
right
;
 
<EOS>
the
reader
,
as
he
come
at
them
,
shall
decide
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
I
maintain
here
,
be
,
that
in
this
one
,
of
the
influence
of
christian
name
,
however
it
gain
foot
,
he
be
serious
;
 
he
be
all
uniformity
;
 
he
be
systematical
,
and
,
like
all
systematic
reasoner
,
he
would
move
both
heaven
and
earth
,
and
twist
and
torture
every
thing
in
nature
to
support
his
hypothesis
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
I
repeat
it
over
again
;
 
he
be
serious
;
 
and
,
in
consequence
of
it
,
he
would
lose
all
kind
of
patience
whenever
he
see
people
,
especially
of
condition
,
who
should
have
know
better
,
 
as
careless
and
as
indifferent
about
the
name
they
impose
upon
their
child
,
 
or
more
so
,
than
in
the
choice
of
Ponto
or
Cupid
for
their
puppy
-
dog
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
he
would
say
,
<EOS>
look'd
ill
;
 
and
have
,
moreover
,
this
particular
aggravation
in
it
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
when
once
a
vile
name
be
wrongfully
or
injudiciously
give
,
'
twas
not
like
the
case
of
a
man
's
character
,
which
,
when
wrong'd
,
may
hereafter
be
clear
;
 
and
,
possibly
,
some
time
or
other
,
if
not
in
the
man
's
life
,
at
least
after
his
death
,
 
be
,
somehow
or
other
,
set
to
right
with
the
world
:
 
but
the
injury
of
this
,
he
would
say
,
could
never
be
undo
;
 
nay
,
he
doubt
even
whether
an
act
of
parliament
could
reach
it
:
 
<EOS>
He
know
as
well
as
you
,
that
the
legislature
assume
a
power
over
surname
;
 
but
for
very
strong
reason
,
which
he
could
give
,
it
have
never
yet
adventure
,
he
would
say
,
to
go
a
step
farther
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
observable
,
that
tho
'
my
father
,
in
consequence
of
this
opinion
,
have
,
as
I
have
tell
you
,
the
strong
liking
and
disliking
towards
certain
name
;
 
that
there
be
still
number
of
name
which
hang
so
equally
in
the
balance
before
him
,
that
they
be
absolutely
indifferent
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
Dick
,
and
Tom
be
of
this
class
:
 
<EOS>
these
my
father
call
neutral
name
;
 
affirming
of
them
,
without
a
satire
<EOS>
,
that
there
have
be
as
many
knave
and
fool
,
at
least
,
as
wise
and
good
man
,
since
the
world
begin
,
who
have
indifferently
bear
them
;
 
so
that
,
like
equal
force
act
against
each
other
in
contrary
direction
,
he
think
they
mutually
destroy
each
other
's
effect
;
for
which
reason
,
he
would
often
declare
,
He
would
not
give
a
cherry
-
stone
to
choose
amongst
them
.
 
<EOS>
Bob
,
which
be
my
brother
's
name
,
be
another
of
these
neutral
kind
of
christian
name
,
which
operate
very
little
either
way
;
and
as
my
father
happen'd
to
be
at
Epsom
,
when
it
be
give
him
,
 
he
would
oft
-
time
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
it
be
no
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Andrew
be
something
like
a
negative
quantity
in
Algebra
with
him
;
 
'
twas
bad
,
he
say
,
than
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
William
stand
pretty
high
:
 
<EOS>
Numps
again
be
low
with
him
:
 
and
Nick
,
he
say
,
be
the
Devil
.
  
<EOS>
but
of
all
name
in
the
universe
<EOS>
he
have
the
most
unconquerable
aversion
for
Tristram
;
 
he
have
the
low
and
most
contemptible
opinion
of
it
of
any
thing
in
the
world
,
 
think
it
could
possibly
produce
nothing
in
rerum
natura
,
but
what
be
extremely
mean
and
pitiful
:
 
so
that
in
the
midst
of
a
dispute
on
the
subject
,
in
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
be
frequently
involve
,
  
he
would
sometimes
break
off
in
a
sudden
and
spirit
Epiphonema
,
or
rather
Erotesis
,
raise
a
third
,
and
sometimes
a
full
fifth
above
the
key
of
the
discourse
,
 
and
demand
it
categorically
of
his
antagonist
,
whether
he
would
take
upon
him
to
say
,
he
have
ever
remember
,
 
whether
he
have
ever
read
,
  
or
even
whether
he
have
ever
hear
tell
of
a
man
,
call
Tristram
,
perform
any
thing
great
or
worth
recording
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
 
he
would
say
,
  
Tristram
!
 
<EOS>
the
thing
be
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
be
want
in
my
father
but
to
have
write
a
book
to
publish
this
notion
of
his
to
the
world
?
 
<EOS>
little
boot
it
to
the
subtle
speculatist
to
stand
single
in
his
opinion
,
 
unless
he
give
them
proper
vent
:
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
identical
thing
which
my
father
do
:
 
for
in
the
year
sixteen
,
<EOS>
which
be
two
year
before
I
be
bear
,
he
be
at
the
pain
of
write
an
express
dissertation
simply
upon
the
word
<EOS>
Tristram
,
 
shew
the
world
,
with
great
candour
and
modesty
,
the
ground
of
his
great
abhorrence
to
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
story
be

with
the
title

page

Will
not
the
gentle
reader
pity
my
father
from
his
soul

<EOS>
to
see
an
orderly

well

dispose
gentleman

who
tho
'
singular
,
 
yet
inoffensive
in
his
notion
,
 
so
play
upon
in

by
cross
purpose

to
look
down
upon
the
stage

see
him
baffle
and
overthrow
in
all
his
little
system
and
wish

to
behold
a
train

event
perpetually
fall
out
against
him

in
so
critical
and
cruel
a
way

as
if

purposedly
be
plann'd
and
point
against
him

merely
to
insult
his
speculation

<EOS>
in

to
behold
such
a

in
his
old
age
,
ill

fit
for
trouble

Tristram

melancholy
dissyllable
of

how
could
you

be
so
inattentive

read

<EOS>
I

that

You

Madam

I
beg
leave
to
repeat
it
over
again
,
that
I
tell
you
as
plain
,
at

,
as
word
,
by
direct
inference
,
could
tell
you
such
a

then

Sir

I

no

<EOS>
My

can
not
allow
you

refuge

<EOS>
then
,
I
declare
,
I
know
nothing

all
about
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
that
,
Madam

be
the
very
fault
I
lie
to
your
charge
;
and
as
a
punishment
for
it
,
I
do
insist
upon
it
,
that
you
immediately
turn
back
,
that
be
as
soon
as
you
get
to
the
next
full
stop

read
the
whole
chapter

<EOS>
I
have
impose
this
penance
upon
the
lady
,
neither
out
of
wantonness
nor
cruelty
;
but
from
the
good
of
motive
;
and
therefore
shall
make
her
no
apology
for
it
when
she
return
back
:
 
'
Tis
to
rebuke
a
vicious
taste
,
which
have
creep
into
thousand
besides
herself
,
 
of
read
straight
forwards
,
more
in
quest
of
the
adventure
,
than
of
the
deep
erudition
and
knowledge
which
a
book
of
this
cast
,
if
read
over
as
it
should
be
,
would
infallibly
impart
with
them
 
<EOS>
the
mind
should
be
accustomed
to
make
wise
reflection
,
and
draw
curious
conclusion
as
it
go
along
;
the
habitude
of
which
make
Pliny

young
affirm
,
"
that
he
never
read
a
book
so
bad
,
but
he
draw
some
profit
from
it

"
 
<EOS>
the
story
of
Greece
and
Rome
,
run
over
without
this
turn
and
application
,
 
do
less
service
,
I
affirm
it
,
than
the
history
of
Parismus

Parismenus
,
or
of
the
Seven
Champions
of
England
,
read
with
it

<EOS>
but
here
come
my
fair
lady

<EOS>
have
you
read
over
again
the

Madam

as
I
desire
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
have

do
you

the
passage

upon

not

be

of

I

,
you

be
sit
on

smoake
his

all
the

in
mute
contemplation
of

of

breech
which
he
have
get

<EOS>
what
can

we

I
think

reply
my

Toby
,
take
his
pipe
from

strike
the
head

it
two

three
time
upon
the
nail

his

as
he
begin
his

I
think
,
say
he
:

to
enter
rightly
into
my

Toby
's
sentiment
upon

you
must
be
make
to
enter
first
a
little
into
his
character

the
out

line

I
shall
just
give

I

I

no

<EOS>
whoever

twas
a

the

draw
from
it

,
"
that

true
and
natural
cause
that
our
comedy
be
so
much
well
than
those
of
France
,
or
any
other
that
either
have
,
or
can
be
write
upon
the
Continent
:
 
<EOS>
that
discovery
be
not
fully
make
till
about
the
middle
of
King
William
's
reign
,
 
when
the
great
Dryden
,
in
write
one
of
his
long
preface
,
(
if
I
mistake
not
)
most
fortunately
hit
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
toward
the
latter
end
of
queen
Anne
,
the
great
Addison
begin
to
patronize
the
notion
,
and
more
fully
explain
it
to
the
world
in
one
or
two
of
his
Spectators
;
 
but
the
discovery
be
not
his
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
fourthly
and
lastly
,
that
this
strange
irregularity
in
our
climate
,
produce
so
strange
an
irregularity
in
our
character
,
 
doth
thereby
,
in
some
sort
,
make
us
amend
,
by
give
us
somewhat
to
make
us
merry
with
when
the
weather
will
not
suffer
us
to
go
out
of
door
,
 
that
observation
be
my
own
;
 
and
be
strike
out
by
me
this
very
rainy
day
,
March
26
,
1759
,
and
betwixt
the
hour
of
nine
and
ten
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
thus
 
thus
,
my
fellow
-
labourer
and
associate
in
this
great
harvest
of
our
learning
,
now
ripen
before
our
eye
;
thus
it
be
,
by
slow
step
of
casual
increase
,
that
our
knowledge
physical
,
metaphysical
,
physiological
,
polemical
,
nautical
,
mathematical
,
aenigmatical
,
technical
,
biographical

with
fifty
other
branch
of
it

(
most
of
'em
end
as
these
do
,
in
ical
)
have
for
these
two
last
century
and
more
,
gradually
be
creep
upwards
towards
that
Akme
of
their
perfection
,
from
which
,
if
we
may
form
a
conjecture
from
the
advance
of
these
last
seven
year
,
we
can
not
possibly
be
far
off
.
  
<EOS>
when
that
happen
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
it
will
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
writing
whatsoever
;
 
the
want
of
all
kind
of
writing
will
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
reading
;
 
and
that
in
time
,
as
war
beget
poverty
;
poverty
peace
,
 
must
,
in
course
,
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
knowledge
,
 
and
then
 
we
shall
have
all
to
begin
over
again
;
or
,
in
other
word
,
be
exactly
where
we
start
.
    
<EOS>
Happy
!
 
<EOS>
Thrice
happy
time
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
that
the
aera
of
my
begetting
,
as
well
as
the
mode
and
manner
of
it
,
have
be
a
little
alter'd
,
 
or
that
it
could
have
be
put
off
,
with
any
convenience
to
my
father
or
mother
,
for
some
twenty
or
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
longer
,
when
a
man
in
the
literary
world
may
have
stand
some
chance
.
    
<EOS>
but
I
forget
my
uncle
Toby
,
whom
all
this
while
we
have
leave
knock
the
ashe
out
of
his
tobacco
-
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
His
humour
be
of
that
particular
specie
,
which
do
honour
to
our
atmosphere
;
and
I
should
have
make
no
scruple
of
rank
him
amongst
one
of
the
first
-
rate
production
of
it
,
have
not
there
appear
too
many
strong
line
in
it
of
a
family
-
likeness
,
which
shew
that
he
derive
the
singularity
of
his
temper
more
from
blood
,
than
either
wind
or
water
,
or
any
modification
or
combination
of
them
<EOS>
whatever
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
,
therefore
,
oft
-
time
wonder
,
that
my
father
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
believe
he
have
his
reason
for
it
,
upon
his
observe
some
token
of
eccentricity
,
in
my
course
,
when
I
be
a
boy
,
 
should
never
once
endeavour
to
account
for
them
in
this
way
:
 
for
<EOS>
all
the
Shandy
Family
be
of
an
original
character
throughout
:
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
male
,
 
the
female
have
no
character
at
all
,
 
except
,
indeed
,
my
great
aunt
Dinah
,
who
,
about
sixty
year
ago
,
be
married
and
get
with
child
by
the
coachman
,
for
which
my
father
,
accord
to
his
hypothesis
of
christian
name
,
would
often
say
,
<EOS>
She
may
thank
her
godfather
and
godmother
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
seem
strange
,
 
and
I
would
as
soon
think
of
drop
a
riddle
in
the
reader
's
way
,
which
be
not
my
interest
to
do
,
as
set
him
upon
guess
how
it
could
come
to
pass
,
that
an
event
of
this
kind
,
so
many
year
after
it
have
happen
,
should
be
reserve
for
the
interruption
of
the
peace
and
unity
,
which
otherwise
so
cordially
subsist
,
between
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
one
would
have
think
,
that
the
whole
force
of
the
misfortune
should
have
spend
and
waste
itself
in
the
family
at
first
,
 
as
be
generally
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
but
nothing
ever
work
with
our
family
after
the
ordinary
way
.
 
<EOS>
possibly
at
the
very
time
this
happen
,
it
may
have
something
else
to
afflict
it
;
and
as
affliction
be
send
down
for
our
good
,
and
that
as
this
have
never
do
the
Shandy
Family
<EOS>
any
good
at
all
,
it
may
lie
wait
till
apt
time
and
circumstance
should
give
it
an
opportunity
to
discharge
its
office
.
 
<EOS>
Observe
,
I
determine
nothing
upon
this
.
 
<EOS>
My
way
be
ever
to
point
out
to
the
curious
,
different
tract
of
investigation
,
to
come
at
the
first
spring
of
the
event
I
tell
;
 
not
with
a
pedantic
Fescue
,
 
or
in
the
decisive
manner
or
Tacitus
,
who
outwit
himself
and
his
reader
;
 
but
with
the
officious
humility
of
a
heart
devote
to
the
assistance
merely
of
the
inquisitive
;
 
to
them
<EOS>
I
write
,
 
and
by
them
I
shall
be
read
,
 
if
any
such
reading
as
this
could
be
suppose
to
hold
out
so
long
,
 
to
the
very
end
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
why
this
cause
of
sorrow
,
therefore
,
be
thus
reserve
for
my
father
and
uncle
,
be
undetermine
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
and
in
what
direction
it
exert
itself
so
as
to
become
the
cause
of
dissatisfaction
between
them
,
<EOS>
after
it
begin
to
operate
,
be
what
I
be
able
to
explain
with
great
exactness
,
and
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
Shandy
,
Madam
,
be
a
gentleman
,
who
,
with
the
virtue
which
usually
constitute
the
character
of
a
man
of
honour
and
rectitude
,
  
possess
one
in
a
very
eminent
degree
,
which
be
seldom
or
never
put
into
the
catalogue
;
and
that
be
a
most
extreme
and
unparallel'd
modesty
of
nature
;
 
though
I
correct
the
word
nature
,
for
this
reason
,
that
I
may
not
prejudge
a
point
which
must
shortly
come
to
a
hearing
,
and
that
be
,
whether
this
modesty
of
his
be
natural
or
acquir'd
.
 
<EOS>
whichever
way
my
uncle
Toby
come
by
it
,
'
twas
nevertheless
modesty
in
the
true
sense
of
it
;
and
that
be
,
Madam
,
not
in
regard
to
word
,
for
he
be
so
unhappy
as
to
have
very
little
choice
in
them
,
 
but
to
thing
;
 
and
this
kind
of
modesty
so
possess
him
,
and
it
arise
to
such
a
height
in
him
,
as
almost
to
equal
,
if
such
a
thing
could
be
,
even
the
modesty
of
a
woman
:
 
<EOS>
that
female
nicety
,
Madam
,
and
<EOS>
inward
cleanliness
of
mind
and
fancy
,
in
your
sex
,
which
make
you
so
much
the
awe
of
ours
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
imagine
,
Madam
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
have
contract
all
this
from
this
very
source
;
 
that
he
have
spend
a
great
part
of
his
time
in
converse
with
your
sex
,
and
that
from
a
thorough
knowledge
of
you
,
and
the
force
of
imitation
which
such
fair
example
render
irresistible
,
he
have
acquire
this
amiable
turn
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
so
,
 
for
unless
it
be
with
his
sister
-
in
-
law
,
my
father
's
wife
and
my
mother
 
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
scarce
exchange
three
word
with
the
sex
in
as
many
year
;
 
no
,
he
get
it
,
Madam
,
by
a
blow
.
 
<EOS>
a
blow
!
  
<EOS>
yes
,
Madam
,
it
be
owe
to
a
blow
from
a
stone
,
break
off
by
a
ball
from
the
parapet
of
a
horn
-
work
at
the
siege
of
Namur
,
which
strike
full
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
.
 
<EOS>
which
way
could
that
effect
it
?
 
<EOS>
the
story
of
that
,
Madam
,
be
long
and
interesting
;
 
but
it
would
be
run
my
history
all
upon
heap
to
give
it
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
for
an
episode
hereafter
;
and
every
circumstance
relate
to
it
,
in
its
proper
place
,
shall
be
faithfully
lay
before
you
:
 
<EOS>
"
till
then
,
it
be
not
in
my
power
to
give
farth
light
into
this
matter
,
or
say
more
than
what
I
have
say
already
,
 
that
my
uncle
Toby
be
a
gentleman
of
unparallel'd
modesty
,
which
happen
to
be
somewhat
subtilize
and
rarifie
by
the
constant
heat
of
a
little
family
pride
,
  
they
both
so
work
together
within
him
,
that
he
could
never
bear
to
hear
the
affair
of
my
aunt
Dinah
touch'd
upon
,
but
with
the
great
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
the
least
hint
of
it
be
enough
to
make
the
blood
fly
into
his
face
;
 
but
when
my
father
enlarge
upon
the
story
in
mixed
company
,
which
the
illustration
of
his
hypothesis
frequently
oblige
him
to
do
,
 
the
unfortunate
blight
of
one
of
the
fair
branch
of
the
family
,
would
set
my
uncle
Toby
's
honour
and
modesty
o'bleeding
;
and
he
would
often
take
my
father
aside
,
in
the
great
concern
imaginable
,
to
expostulate
and
tell
him
,
he
would
give
him
any
thing
in
the
world
,
only
to
let
the
story
rest
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
I
believe
,
have
the
true
love
and
tenderness
for
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
ever
one
brother
bear
towards
another
,
and
would
have
do
any
thing
in
nature
,
which
one
brother
in
reason
could
have
desir'd
of
another
,
to
have
make
my
uncle
Toby
's
heart
easy
in
this
,
or
any
other
point
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
lie
out
of
his
power
.
     
<EOS>
My
father
,
as
I
tell
you
be
a
philosopher
in
grain
,
 
<EOS>
speculative
,
  
systematical
;
 
and
my
aunt
Dinah
's
affair
<EOS>
be
a
matter
of
as
much
consequence
to
him
,
as
the
retrogradation
of
the
planet
to
copernicus
:
  
<EOS>
the
backsliding
of
Venus
in
her
orbit
fortify
the
copernican
system
,
call
so
after
his
name
;
and
the
backsliding
of
my
aunt
Dinah
in
her
orbit
,
do
the
same
service
in
establish
my
father
's
system
,
which
,
I
trust
,
will
for
ever
hereafter
be
call
the
Shandean
System
,
after
his
.
  
<EOS>
in
any
other
family
dishonour
,
my
father
,
I
believe
,
have
as
nice
a
sense
of
shame
as
any
man
whatever
;
 
and
neither
he
,
nor
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
Copernicus
,
would
have
divulge
the
affair
in
either
case
,
or
have
take
the
least
notice
of
it
to
the
world
,
but
for
the
obligation
they
owe
,
as
they
think
,
to
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Amicus
Plato
,
my
father
would
say
,
construe
the
word
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
he
go
along
,
Amicus
Plato
;
that
is
,
Dinah
be
my
aunt
;
 
sed
magis
amica
veritas
 
<EOS>
but
Truth
be
my
sister
.
  
<EOS>
this
contrariety
of
humours
betwixt
my
father
and
my
uncle
,
be
the
source
of
many
a
fraternal
squabble
.
 
<EOS>
the
one
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
tale
of
family
disgrace
record
,
 
and
the
other
would
scarce
ever
let
a
day
pass
to
an
end
without
some
hint
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
my
uncle
Toby
would
cry
,
 
and
for
my
sake
,
and
for
all
our
sake
,
my
dear
brother
Shandy
,
 
do
let
this
story
of
our
aunt
's
and
her
ashe
sleep
in
peace
;
 
how
can
you
,
 
how
can
you
have
so
little
feeling
and
compassion
for
the
character
of
our
family
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
character
of
a
family
to
an
hypothesis
?
<EOS>
my
father
would
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
you
come
to
that
  
what
be
the
life
of
a
family
?
 
<EOS>
the
life
of
a
family
!
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
would
say
,
throw
himself
back
in
his
arm
chair
,
and
lift
up
his
hand
,
his
eye
,
and
one
leg
 
<EOS>
yes
,
the
life
,
 
my
father
would
say
,
maintain
his
point
.
 
<EOS>
how
many
thousand
of
'em
be
there
every
year
that
come
cast
away
,
(
in
all
civilized
country
at
least
)
 
and
consider
as
nothing
but
common
air
,
in
competition
of
an
hypothesis
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
plain
sense
of
thing
,
my
uncle
Toby
would
answer
,
 
<EOS>
every
such
instance
be
downright
Murder
,
let
who
will
commit
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
lie
your
mistake
,
my
father
would
reply
;
 
for
,
in
Foro
Scientiae
there
be
no
such
thing
as
Murder
,
 
'
tis
<EOS>
only
death
,
brother
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
would
never
offer
to
answer
this
by
any
other
kind
of
argument
,
than
that
of
whistle
half
a
dozen
bar
of
Lillebullero
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
it
be
the
usual
channel
thro
'
which
his
passion
get
vent
,
when
any
thing
shock
or
surprize
him
:
 
but
especially
when
any
thing
,
which
he
deem'd
very
absurd
,
be
offer
.
  
<EOS>
as
not
one
of
our
logical
writer
,
nor
any
of
the
commentator
upon
them
,
that
I
remember
,
have
think
proper
to
give
a
name
to
this
particular
specie
of
argument
.
 
<EOS>
I
here
take
the
liberty
to
do
it
myself
,
for
two
reason
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
that
,
in
order
to
prevent
all
confusion
in
dispute
,
it
may
stand
as
much
distinguish
for
ever
,
from
every
other
specie
of
argument
 
as
the
Argumentum
ad
Verecundiam
,
ex
Absurdo
,
ex
Fortiori
,
or
any
other
argument
whatsoever
:
 
and
,
secondly
,
that
it
may
be
say
by
my
child
's
child
,
when
my
head
be
lay
to
rest
,
 
that
their
learn'd
grandfather
's
head
have
be
busy
to
as
much
purpose
once
,

the

unanswerable
argument
in

contrarywise

be
make
use

these
two
be
enough
in
conscience
for
one
lecture

,
moreover
,
as
the

be
the
good
answer
to
the

let
them

the

Bishop
Hall

Dr.
Joseph

of

in

First

,
"
that
it
be
an
abominable
thing
for
a
man
to
commend
himself
;
"
 
and
<EOS>
I
really
think
it
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
when
a
thing
be
execute
in
a
masterly
kind
of
a
fashion
,
which
thing
be
not
likely
to
be
find
out
;
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
full
as
abominable
,
that
a
man
should
lose
the
honour
of
it
,
and
go
out
of
the
world
with
the
conceit
of
it
rot
in
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
precisely
my
situation
.
   
<EOS>
for
in
this
long
digression
which
I
be
accidentally
lead
into
,
as
in
all
my
digression
(
one
only
except
)
<EOS>
there
be
a
master
-
stroke
of
digressive
skill
,
the
merit
of
which
have
all
along
,
I
fear
,
be
over
-
look
by
my
reader
,
 
not
for
want
of
penetration
in
him
,
 
but
because
'
tis
an
excellence
seldom
look
for
,
or
expect
indeed
,
in
a
digression
;
 
and
it
be
this
:
 
<EOS>
that
tho
"
<EOS>
my
digression
be
all
fair
,
as
you
observe
,
 
and
that
I
fly
off
from
what
I
be
about
,
as
far
,
and
as
often
too
,
as
any
writer
in
Great
Britain
;
yet
I
constantly
take
care
to
order
affair
so
that
my
main
business
do
not
stand
still
in
my
absence
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
just
go
,
for
example
,
to
have
give
you
the
great
out
-
line
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
most
whimsical
character
;
 
when
my
aunt
Dinah
and
the
coachman
come
across
us
,
and
lead
us
a
vagary
some
million
of
mile
into
the
very
heart
of
the
planetary
system
:
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
this
,
you
perceive
that
the
drawing
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
go
on
gently
all
the
time
;
 
not
the
great
contour
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
impossible
,
 
but
some
familiar
stroke
and
faint
designation
of
it
,
be
here
and
there
touch'd
<EOS>
on
,
as
we
go
along
,
so
that
you
be
much
better
acquaint
with
my
uncle
Toby
now
than
you
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
contrivance
the
machinery
of
my
work
be
of
a
species
by
itself
;
two
contrary
motion
be
introduce
into
it
,
and
reconcile
,
which
be
think
to
be
at
variance
with
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
my
work
be
digressive
,
and
it
be
progressive
too
,
 
and
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
Sir
,
be
a
very
different
story
from
that
of
the
earth
's
move
round
<EOS>
her
axis
,
in
her
diurnal
rotation
,
with
her
progress
in
her
elliptick
orbit
which
bring
about
the
year
,
and
constitute
that
variety
and
vicissitude
of
season
we
enjoy
;
 
though
I
own
<EOS>
it
suggest
the
thought
,
 
as
I
believe
the
great
of
our
boasted
improvement
and
discovery
have
come
from
such
trifling
hint
.
  
<EOS>
digression
,
incontestably
,
be
the
sunshine
;
 
they
be
the
life
,
the
soul
of
read
!
 
<EOS>
take
them
out
of
this
book
,
for
instance
,
 
you
may
as
well
take
the
book
along
with
them
;
 
one
cold
eternal
winter
would
reign
in
every
page
of
it
;
restore
them
to
the
writer
;
 
he
step
forth
like
a
bridegroom
,
 
bid
all
-
hail
;
bring
in
variety
,
and
forbid
the
appetite
to
fail
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
dexterity
be
in
the
good
cookery
and
management
of
them
,
so
as
to
be
not
only
for
the
advantage
of
the
reader
,
but
also
of
the
author
,
whose
distress
,
in
this
matter
,
be
truly
pitiable
:
 
<EOS>
for
,
if
he
begin
a
digression
,
 
from
that
moment
,
I
observe
,
his
whole
work
stand
stock
still
;
 
and
if
he
go
on
with
his
main
work
,
 
then
there
be
an
end
of
his
digression
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
vile
work
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
from
the
beginning
of
this
,
you
see
,
I
have
construct
the
main
work
and
the
adventitious
part
of
it
with
such
intersection
,
and
have
so
complicate
and
involve
the
digressive
and
progressive
movement
,
one
wheel
within
another
,
that
the
whole
machine
,
in
general
,
have
be
keep
a
-
going
;
 
and
,
what
be
more
,
it
shall
be
keep
a
-
go
these
forty
year
,
if
it
please
the
fountain
of
health
to
bless
me
so
long
with
life
and
good
spirit
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
propensity
in
me
to
begin
this
chapter
very
nonsensically
,
and
I
will
not
balk
my
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
I
set
off
thus
:
  
<EOS>
if
the
fixture
of
Momus
's
glass
in
the
human
breast
,
accord
to
the
propose
emendation
of
that
arch
-
critick
,
have
take
place
,
 
first
,
this
foolish
consequence
would
certainly
have
follow
,
 
that
the
very
wise
and
very
gravest
of
us
all
,
in
one
coin
or
other
,
must
have
pay
window-
money
every
day
of
our
life
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
secondly
,
that
have
the
say
glass
be
there
set
up
,
nothing
more
would
have
be
want
,
in
order
to
have
take
a
man
's
character
,
but
to
have
take
a
chair
and
go
softly
,
as
you
would
to
a
dioptrical
bee
-
hive
,
and
look'd
<EOS>
in
,
 
view'd
<EOS>
the
soul
stark
naked
;
 
observe
all
her
motion
,
  
her
machination
;
 
trace
all
her
maggot
from
their
first
engender
to
their
crawling
forth
;
 
watch
her
loose
in
her
frisk
,
her
gambol
,
her
capricio
;
and
after
some
notice
of
her
more
solemn
deportment
,
consequent
upon
such
frisk
,
&
c.
 
then
take
your
pen
and
ink
and
set
down
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
you
have
see
,
and
could
have
swear
to
:
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
an
advantage
not
to
be
have
by
the
biographer
in
this
planet
;
 
in
the
planet
Mercury
(
belike
)
<EOS>
it
may
be
so
,
if
not
well
still
for
him
;
 
for
there
the
intense
heat
of
the
country
,
which
be
prove
by
computator
,
from
its
vicinity
to
the
sun
,
to
be
more
than
equal
to
that
of
red
-
hot
iron
,
 
<EOS>
must
,
I
think
,
long
ago
have
vitrify
the
body
of
the
inhabitant
,
(
as
the
efficient
cause
)
to
suit
them
for
the
climate
(
which
be
the
final
cause
;
)
so
that
betwixt
them
both
,
all
the
tenement
of
their
soul
,
from
top
to
bottom
,
may
be
nothing
else
,
for
aught
the
soundest
philosophy
can
shew
to
the
contrary
,
but
one
fine
transparent
body
of
clear
glass
(
bate
the
umbilical
knot
)
 
so
that
,
till
the
inhabitant
grow
old
and
tolerably
wrinkle
,
whereby
the
ray
of
light
,
in
pass
through
them
,
become
so
monstrously
refract
,
 
or
return
reflect
from
their
surface
in
such
transverse
line
to
the
eye
,
that
a
man
can
not
be
see
through
;
 
his
soul
may
as
well
,
unless
for
mere
ceremony
,
or
the
trifling
advantage
which
the
umbilical
point
give
her
,
  
may
,
upon
all
other
account
,
I
say
,
as
well
play
the
fool
out
o'doors
as
in
her
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
,
as
I
say
above
,
be
not
the
case
of
the
inhabitant
of
this
earth
;
 
our
mind
shine
not
through
the
body
,
but
be
wrapt
up
here
in
a
dark
covering
of
uncrystalized
flesh
and
blood
;
so
that
,
if
we
would
come
to
the
specific
character
of
them
,
we
must
go
some
other
way
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
many
,
in
good
truth
,
be
the
way
,
which
human
wit
have
be
force
to
take
,
to
do
this
thing
with
exactness
.
  
<EOS>
some
,
for
instance
,
draw
all
their
character
with
wind
-
instrument
.
  
<EOS>
Virgil
take
notice
of
that
way
in
the
affair
of
Dido
and
Aeneas
;
 
but
it
be
as
fallacious
as
the
breath
of
fame
;
 
and
,
moreover
,
bespeak
a
narrow
genius
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
ignorant
that
the
Italians
pretend
to
a
mathematical
exactness
in
their
designation
of
one
particular
sort
of
character
among
them
,
from
the
forte
or
piano
of
a
certain
wind
-
instrument
they
use
,
 
which
they
say
be
infallible
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
mention
the
name
of
the
instrument
in
this
place
;
 
'
tis
sufficient
<EOS>
we
have
it
amongst
us
,
 
but
never
think
of
make
a
drawing
by
it
;
 
this
be
aenigmatical
,
and
intend
to
be
so
,
at
least
ad
populum
:
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
,
I
beg
,
<EOS>
Madam
,
when
you
come
here
,
that
you
read
on
as
fast
as
you
can
,
and
never
stop
to
make
any
inquiry
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
other
again
,
who
will
draw
a
man
's
character
from
no
other
help
in
the
world
,
but
merely
from
his
evacuation
;
 
but
this
often
give
a
very
incorrect
outline
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
you
take
a
sketch
of
his
repletion
too
;
and
by
correct
one
draw
from
the
other
,
compound
one
good
figure
out
of
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
no
objection
to
this
method
,
but
that
I
think
it
must
smell
too
strong
of
the
lamp
,
 
and
be
render'd
still
more
operose
,
by
force
you
to
have
an
eye
to
the
rest
of
his
non
-
natural
.
 
<EOS>
why
the
most
natural
action
of
a
man
's
life
should
be
call
his
Non
-
natural
,
 
be
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
other
,
fourthly
,
who
disdain
every
one
of
these
expedient
;
 
not
from
any
fertility
of
their
own
,
but
from
the
various
way
of
do
it
,
which
they
have
borrow
from
the
honourable
device
which
the
Pentagraphic
Brethren
(
Pentagraph
,
an
instrument
to
copy
Prints
and
Pictures
mechanically
,
and
in
any
proportion
.
)
<EOS>
of
the
brush
have
shew
in
take
copy
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
you
must
know
,
be
your
great
historian
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
these
you
will
see
draw
a
full
length
character
against
the
light
;
 
that
be
illiberal
,
 
dishonest
,
 
and
hard
upon
the
character
of
the
man
who
sit
.
  
<EOS>
other
,
to
mend
the
matter
,
will
make
a
drawing
of
you
in
the
Camera
;
 
that
be
most
unfair
of
all
,
because
,
there
you
be
sure
to
be
represent
in
some
of
your
most
ridiculous
attitude
.
  
<EOS>
to
avoid
all
and
every
one
of
these
error
in
give
you
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
,
I
be
determined
to
draw
it
by
no
mechanical
help
<EOS>
whatever
;
 
nor
shall
my
pencil
be
guide
by
any
one
wind
-
instrument
which
ever
be
blow
upon
,
either
on
this
,
or
on
the
other
side
of
the
Alps
;
 
nor
will
I
consider
either
his
repletion
or
his
discharge
,
 
or
touch
upon
his
Non-
natural
;
but
,
in
a
word
,
I
will
draw
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
from
his
Hobby
-
Horse
.
    
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
morally
sure
that
the
reader
must
be
out
of
all
patience
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
,
 
I
would
here
previously
have
convince
him
that
there
be
no
instrument
so
fit
to
draw
such
a
thing
with
,
as
that
which
I
have
pitch'd
upon
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
and
his
Hobby
-
Horse
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
they
act
and
re
-
act
exactly
after
the
same
manner
in
which
the
soul
and
body
do
upon
each
other
:
 
<EOS>
yet
doubtless
there
be
a
communication
between
them
of
some
kind
;
and
my
opinion
rather
be
,
that
there
be
something
in
it
more
of
the
manner
of
electrify
body
,
 
and
that
,
by
mean
of
the
heated
part
of
the
rider
,
which
come
immediately
into
contact
with
the
back
of
the
Hobby-
Horse
,
 
by
long
journie
and
much
friction
,
it
so
happen
,
that
the
body
of
the
rider
be
at
<EOS>
length
fill'd
as
full
of
Hobby
-
Horsical
matter
as
it
can
hold
;
 
so
that
if
you
be
able
to
give
but
a
clear
description
of
the
nature
of
the
one
,
you
may
form
a
pretty
exact
notion
of
the
genius
and
character
of
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
now
the
Hobby
-
Horse
which
my
uncle
Toby
always
ride
upon
,
be
in
my
opinion
an
Hobby
-
Horse
<EOS>
well
worth
give
a
description
of
,
if
it
be
only
upon
the
score
of
his
great
singularity
;
 
for
you
may
have
travel
from
York
to
Dover
,
 
from
Dover
to
Penzance
in
Cornwall
,
and
from
Penzance
to
York
back
again
,
and
not
have
see
such
another
upon
the
road
;
or
if
you
have
see
such
a
one
,
whatever
haste
you
have
be
in
,
you
must
infallibly
have
stopp'd
to
have
take
a
view
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
gait
and
figure
of
him
be
so
strange
,
and
<EOS>
so
utterly
unlike
be
he
,
from
his
head
to
his
tail
,
to
any
one
of
the
whole
specie
,
that
it
be
now
and
then
make
a
matter
of
dispute
,
 
whether
he
be
really
a
Hobby
-
Horse
or
no
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
Philosopher
would
use
no
other
argument
to
the
Sceptic
,
who
dispute
with
him
against
the
reality
of
motion
,
save
that
of
rise
up
upon
his
leg
,
and
walk
across
the
room
;
 
so
would
my
uncle
Toby
use
no
other
argument
to
prove
his
Hobby
-
Horse
be
a
Hobby
-
Horse
indeed
,
but
by
get
upon
his
back
and
ride
him
about
;
 
leave
the
world
,
after
that
,
to
determine
the
point
as
it
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
in
good
truth
,
my
uncle
Toby
mount
him
with
so
much
pleasure
,
and
he
carry
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
so
well
,
 
that
he
trouble
his
head
very
little
with
what
the
world
either
say
or
think
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
high
time
,
however
,
that
I
give
you
a
description
of
him
:
 
<EOS>
but
to
go
on
regularly
,
I
only
beg
you
will
give
me
leave
to
acquaint
you
first
,
<EOS>
how
my
uncle
Toby
come
by
him
.
    
<EOS>
the
wound
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
,
which
he
receive
at
the
siege
of
Namur
,
render
him
unfit
for
the
service
<EOS>
,
it
be
think
expedient
he
should
return
to
England
,
in
order
,
if
possible
,
to
be
set
to
right
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
four
year
totally
confine
,
 
part
of
it
to
his
bed
,
and
all
of
it
to
his
room
:
 
and
in
the
course
of
his
cure
,
which
be
all
that
time
in
hand
,
suffer'd
unspeakable
misery
,
 
owe
to
a
succession
of
exfoliation
from
the
os
pubis
,
and
the
outward
edge
of
that
part
of
the
coxendix
call
the
os
illium
,
 
both
which
bone
be
dismally
crush'd
,
as
much
by
the
irregularity
of
the
stone
,
which
I
tell
you
be
break
off
the
parapet
,
 
as
by
its
size
,
 
<EOS>
(
tho
'
<EOS>
it
be
pretty
large
)
which
incline
the
surgeon
all
along
to
think
,
that
the
great
injury
which
it
have
do
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
,
be
more
owing
to
the
gravity
of
the
stone
itself
,
than
to
the
projectile
force
of
it
,
 
which
he
would
often
tell
him
be
a
great
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
at
that
time
be
just
begin
business
in
London
,
and
have
take
a
house
;
 
and
as
the
true
friendship
and
cordiality
subsist
between
the
two
brother
,
 
and
that
my
father
think
my
uncle
Toby
could
no
where
be
so
well
nurse
and
take
care
of
as
in
his
own
house
,
 
he
assign'd
<EOS>
him
the
very
good
apartment
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
a
much
more
sincere
mark
of
his
affection
still
<EOS>
,
he
would
never
suffer
a
friend
or
an
acquaintance
to
step
into
the
house
on
any
occasion
,
but
he
would
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
him
up
stair
to
see
his
brother
Toby
,
and
chat
an
hour
by
his
bed
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
the
history
of
a
soldier
's
wound
beguile
the
pain
of
it
;
 
my
uncle
's
visitor
at
least
think
so
,
and
in
their
daily
call
upon
him
,
from
the
courtesy
arise
out
of
that
belief
,
they
would
frequently
turn
the
discourse
to
that
subject
,
 
and
from
that
subject
the
discourse
would
generally
roll
on
to
the
siege
itself
.
  
<EOS>
these
conversation
be
infinitely
kind
;
and
my
uncle
Toby
receive
great
relief
from
them
,
and
would
have
receive
much
more
,
but
that
they
bring
him
into
some
unforeseen
perplexity
,
which
,
for
three
month
together
,
retard
his
cure
greatly
;
and
if
he
have
not
hit
upon
an
expedient
to
extricate
himself
out
of
them
,
I
verily
believe
they
would
have
lay
him
in
his
grave
.
  
<EOS>
what
these
perplexity
of
my
uncle
Toby
be
,
 
'
tis
impossible
for
you
to
guess
;
 
if
you
could
,
 
I
should
blush
;
not
as
a
relation
,
 
not
as
a
man
,
  
nor
even
as
a
woman
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
blush
as
an
author
;
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
I
set
no
small
store
by
myself
upon
this
very
account
,
that
my
reader
have
never
yet
be
able
to
guess
at
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
this
,
Sir
,
I
be
of
so
nice
and
singular
a
humour
,
that
if
I
think
you
be
able
to
form
the
least
judgment
or
probable
conjecture
to
yourself
,
of
what
be
to
come
in
the
next
page
,
 
I
would
tear
it
out
of
my
book
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
begin
a
new
book
,
on
purpose
that
I
may
have
room
enough
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
perplexity
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
be
involve
,
from
the
many
discourse
and
interrogation
about
the
siege
of
Namur
,
where
he
receive
his
wound
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
remind
the
reader
,
in
case
he
have
read
the
history
of
King
William
's
war
,
 
but
if
he
have
not
,
 
I
then
inform
him
,
that
one
of
the
most
memorable
attack
in
that
siege
,
be
that
which
be
make
by
the
English
and
Dutch
upon
the
point
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
,
between
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
which
inclose
the
great
sluice
or
water
-
stop
,
where
the
English
be
terribly
expose
to
the
shot
of
the
counter
-
guard
and
demi
-
bastion
of
St.
Roch
:
 
<EOS>
the
issue
of
which
hot
dispute
,
in
three
word
,
be
this
;
 
that
the
Dutch
lodge
themselves
upon
the
counter
-
guard
,
 
and
that
the
English
make
themselves
master
of
the
cover
-
way
before
St.
Nicolas
-
gate
,
notwithstanding
the
gallantry
of
the
french
officer
,
who
expose
themselves
upon
the
glacis
sword
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
the
principal
attack
of
which
my
uncle
Toby
be
an
eye
-
witness
at
Namur
,
 
the
army
of
the
besieger
be
cut
off
,
by
the
confluence
of
the
Maes
and
Sambre
,
from
see
much
of
each
other
's
operation
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
be
generally
more
eloquent
and
particular
in
his
account
of
it
;
and
the
many
perplexity
he
be
in
,
arise
out
of
the
almost
insurmountable
difficulty
he
find
in
tell
his
story
intelligibly
,
and
give
such
clear
idea
of
the
difference
and
distinction
between
the
scarp
and
counterscarp
,
 
the
glacis
and
cover
-
way
,
 
the
half
-
moon
and
ravelin
,
 
as
to
make
his
company
fully
comprehend
where
and
what
he
be
about
.
  
<EOS>
writer
themselves
be
too
apt
to
confound
these
term
;
so
that
you
will
the
less
wonder
,
if
in
his
endeavour
to
explain
them
,
and
in
opposition
to
many
misconception
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
do
oft
-
time
puzzle
his
visitor
,
and
sometimes
himself
too
.
  
<EOS>
to
speak
the
truth
,
unless
the
company
my
father
lead
up
stair
be
tolerably
clear
-
headed
,
or
my
uncle
Toby
be
in
one
of
his
explanatory
mood
,
'
twa
a
difficult
thing
,
do
what
he
could
,
to
keep
the
discourse
free
from
obscurity
.
  
<EOS>
what
render
the
account
of
this
affair
the
more
intricate
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
be
this
,
 
that
in
the
attack
of
the
counterscarp
,
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
extend
itself
from
the
bank
of
the
Maes
,
quite
up
to
the
great
water
-
stop
,
 
the
ground
be
cut
and
cross
cut
with
such
a
multitude
of
dyke
,
drain
,
rivulet
,
and
sluice
,
on
all
side
,
 
and
he
would
get
so
sadly
bewilder
,
and
set
fast
amongst
them
,
that
frequently
he
could
neither
get
backwards
or
forwards
to
save
his
life
;
and
be
oft
-
time
oblige
to
give
up
the
attack
upon
that
very
account
only
.
   
<EOS>
these
perplexing
rebuff
give
my
uncle
Toby
Shandy
more
perturbation
than
you
would
imagine
;
and
as
my
father
's
kindness
to
him
be
continually
drag
up
fresh
friend
and
fresh
enquirer
,
 
he
have
but
a
very
uneasy
task
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
no
doubt
my
uncle
Toby
have
great
command
of
himself
,
 
and
could
guard
appearance
,
I
believe
,
as
well
as
most
man
;
 
yet
any
one
may
imagine
,
that
when
he
could
not
retreat
out
of
the
ravelin
without
get
into
the
half-
moon
,
or
get
out
of
the
cover
-
way
without
fall
down
the
counterscarp
,
nor
cross
the
dyke
without
danger
of
slip
into
the
ditch
,
but
that
he
must
have
fret
and
fume
inwardly
:
 
He
do
so
;
 
and
the
little
and
hourly
vexation
,
which
may
seem
trifling
and
of
no
account
to
the
man
who
have
not
read
hippocrate
,
yet
,
whoever
have
read
Hippocrates
,
or
Dr.
James
Mackenzie
,
and
have
consider
well
the
effect
which
the
passion
and
affection
of
the
mind
have
upon
the
digestion
 
<EOS>
(
why
not
of
a
wound
as
well
as
of
a
dinner
?
)
 
<EOS>
may
easily
conceive
what
sharp
paroxysm
and
exacerbation
of
his
wound
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
must
have
undergo
upon
that
score
only
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
could
not
philosophize
upon
it
;
 
'
<EOS>
twas
enough
<EOS>
he
feel
it
be
so
,
 
and
have
sustain
the
pain
and
sorrow
of
it
for
three
month
together
,
he
be
resolve
some
way
or
other
to
extricate
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
one
morning
lie
upon
his
back
in
his
bed
,
the
anguish
and
nature
of
the
wound
upon
his
groin
suffer
him
to
lie
in
no
other
position
,
when
a
thought
come
into
his
head
,
that
if
he
could
purchase
such
a
thing
,
and
have
it
paste
down
upon
a
board
,
as
a
large
map
of
the
fortification
of
the
town
and
citadel
of
Namur
,
with
its
environ
,
it
may
be
a
means
of
give
him
ease
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
notice
of
his
desire
to
have
the
environ
along
with
the
town
and
citadel
,
for
this
reason
,
 
because
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound
be
get
in
one
of
the
traverse
,
about
thirty
toise
from
the
return
angle
of
the
trench
,
opposite
to
the
salient
angle
of
the
demi
-
bastion
of
St.
Roch
:
 
so
that
he
be
pretty
confident
he
could
stick
a
pin
upon
the
identical
spot
of
ground
where
he
be
stand
on
when
the
stone
strike
him
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
succeed
to
his
wish
,
and
not
only
free
him
from
a
world
of
sad
explanation
,
but
,
in
the
end
,
it
prove
the
happy
mean
,
as
you
will
read
,
of
procure
my
uncle
Toby
his
Hobby
-
Horse
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
foolish
,
when
you
be
at
the
expence
of
make
an
entertainment
of
this
kind
,
as
to
order
thing
so
badly
,
as
to
let
your
critick
and
gentry
of
refined
taste
run
it
down
:
 
nor
be
there
any
thing
so
likely
to
make
them
do
it
,
as
that
of
leave
them
out
of
the
party
,
or
,
what
be
full
as
offensive
,
of
bestow
your
attention
upon
the
rest
of
your
guest
in
so
particular
a
way
,
as
if
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
critick
(
by
occupation
)
at
table
.
    
<EOS>
I
guard
against
both
;
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
have
leave
half
a
dozen
place
purposely
open
for
them
;
 
and
in
the
next
place
,
I
pay
them
all
court
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
kiss
your
hand
,
I
protest
no
company
could
give
me
half
the
pleasure
,
 
by
my
soul
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
see
you
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
only
you
will
make
no
stranger
of
yourself
,
but
sit
down
without
any
ceremony
,
and
fall
on
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
I
have
leave
six
place
,
and
I
be
upon
the
point
of
carry
my
complaisance
so
far
,
as
to
have
leave
a
seventh
open
for
them
,
 
and
in
this
very
spot
I
stand
on
;
but
be
tell
by
a
Critick
(
tho
'
not
by
occupation
,
 
but
by
nature
)
that
I
have
acquit
myself
well
enough
<EOS>
,
I
shall
fill
it
up
directly
,
hope
,
in
the
mean
time
,
that
I
shall
be
able
to
make
a
great
deal
of
more
room
next
year
.
     
<EOS>
how
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
!
<EOS>
could
your
uncle
Toby
,
who
,
it
seem
,
be
a
military
man
,
and
whom
you
have
represent
as
no
fool
<EOS>
,
 
be
at
the
same
time
<EOS>
such
a
confused
,
pudding
-
headed
,
muddle
-
headed
,
fellow
,
as
 
Go
look
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
Sir
Critick
,
I
could
have
reply
;
but
I
scorn
it
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
language
unurbane
,
 
and
only
befit
the
man
who
can
not
give
clear
and
satisfactory
account
of
thing
,
or
dive
deep
enough
into
the
first
cause
of
human
ignorance
and
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
moreover
the
reply
valiant
 
and
therefore
I
reject
it
;
for
tho
"
it
may
have
suit
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
as
a
soldier
excellently
well
,
 
and
have
he
not
accustom
himself
,
in
such
attack
,
to
whistle
the
Lillabullero
,
as
he
want
no
courage
,
'
tis
the
very
answer
he
would
have
give
;
yet
it
would
by
no
means
have
do
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
as
plain
as
can
be
,
that
I
write
as
a
man
of
erudition
;
 
that
even
my
similie
,
my
allusion
,
my
illustration
,
my
metaphor
,
be
erudite
,
 
and
that
I
must
sustain
my
character
properly
,
and
contrast
it
properly
too
,
 
else
what
would
become
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
Sir
,
I
should
be
undo
;
 
at
this
very
moment
that
I
be
go
here
to
fill
up
one
place
against
a
critick
,
 
I
should
have
make
an
opening
for
a
couple
.
    
<EOS>
therefore
I
answer
thus
:
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Sir
,
in
all
the
reading
which
you
have
ever
read
,
do
you
ever
read
such
a
book
as
Locke
's
Essay
upon
the
Human
Understanding
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
answer
me
rashly
 
because
many
,
I
know
,
quote
the
book
,
who
have
not
read
it
 
and
many
have
read
it
who
understand
it
not
:
 
<EOS>
if
either
of
these
be
your
case
,
as
I
write
to
instruct
,
I
will
tell
you
in
three
word
what
the
book
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a

<EOS>
do

<EOS>
It
be
a
history
-
book
,
Sir
,
(
which
may
possibly
recommend
it
to
the
world
)
of
what
pass
in
a
man
's
own
mind
;
and
if
you
will
say
so
much
of
the
book
,
and
no
more
,
believe
me
,
you
will
cut
no
contemptible
figure
in
a
metaphysick
circle
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
now
if
you
will
venture
to
go
along
with
me
,
and
look
down
into
the
bottom
of
this
matter
,
it
will
be
find
that
the
cause
of
obscurity
and
confusion
,
in
the
mind
of
a
man
,
be
threefold
.
  
<EOS>
dull
organ
,
dear
Sir
,
in
the
first
place
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
slight
and
transient
impression
make
by
the
object
,
when
the
say
organ
be
not
dull
.
 
<EOS>
and
thirdly
,
a
memory
like
unto
a
sieve
,
not
able
to
retain
what
it
have
receive
.
 
<EOS>
call
down
dolly
your
chamber
-
maid
,
and
I
will
give
you
my
cap
and
bell
along
with
it
,
if
I
make
not
this
matter
so
plain
that
Dolly
herself
should
understand
it
as
well
as
Malbranch
.
 
<EOS>
when
Dolly
have
indite
her
epistle
to
Robin
,
and
have
thrust
her
arm
into
the
bottom
of
her
pocket
hang
by
her
right
side
;
 
take
that
opportunity
to
recollect
that
the
organ
and
faculty
of
perception
can
,
by
nothing
in
this
world
,
be
so
aptly
typify
and
explain
as
by
that
one
thing
which
Dolly
's
hand
be
in
search
of
.
 
<EOS>
Your
organ
be
not
so
dull
that
I
should
inform
you
 
'
tis
an
inch
,
Sir
,
of
red
seal
-
wax
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
be
melt
and
drop
upon
the
letter
,
if
Dolly
fumble
too
long
for
her
thimble
,
till
the
wax
be
over
harden
,
it
will
not
receive
the
mark
of
her
thimble
from
the
usual
impulse
which
be
will
not
to
imprint
it
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
if
Dolly
's
wax
,
for
want
of
better
,
be
bee
-
wax
,
or
of
a
temper
too
soft
,
 
tho
'
it
may
receive
,
 
it
will
not
hold
the
impression
,
how
hard
soever
Dolly
thrust
against
it
;
and
last
of
all
,
suppose
the
wax
good
,
and
eke
the
thimble
,
but
apply
thereto
in
careless
haste
,
as
her
Mistress
ring
the
bell
;
 
in
any
one
of
these
three
case
the
print
leave
by
the
thimble
will
be
as
unlike
the
prototype
as
a
brass
-
jack
.
  
<EOS>
now
you
must
understand
that
not
one
of
these
be
the
true
cause
of
the
confusion
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
discourse
;
and
it
be
for
that
very
reason
I
enlarge
upon
them
so
long
,
after
the
manner
of
great
physiologist
 
<EOS>
to
shew
the
world
,
what
it
do
not
arise
from
.
  
<EOS>
what
it
do
arise
from
,
I
have
hint
above
,
and
a
fertile
source
of
obscurity
it
be
,
 
and
ever
will
be
,
 
and
that
be
the
unsteady
use
of
word
,
which
have
perplex
the
clear
and
most
exalted
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
ten
to
one
(
at
Arthur
's
)
whether
you
have
ever
read
the
literary
history
of
past
age
;
 
if
you
have
,
what
terrible
battle
,
"
yclept
logomachy
,
have
they
occasion
and
perpetuate
with
so
much
gall
and
ink
-
shed
,
 
that
a
good
-
natured
man
can
not
read
the
account
of
them
without
tear
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
gentle
critick
!
<EOS>
when
thou
hast
weigh
all
this
,
and
consider
within
thyself
how
much
of
thy
own
knowledge
,
discourse
,
and
conversation
have
be
pester
and
disorder
,
at
one
time
or
other
,
by
this
,
and
this
only
:
  
<EOS>
what
a
pudder
and
racket
in
council
about
(
Greek
)
;
and
in
the
Schools
of
the
learn
about
power
and
about
spirit
;
 
about
essence
,
and
about
quintessence
;
 
about
substance
,
and
about
space
.
 
<EOS>
what
confusion
in
great
theatre
from
word
of
little
meaning
,
and
as
indeterminate
a
sense
!
<EOS>
when
thou
considerest
this
,
thou
wilt
not
wonder
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
perplexity
,
 
thou
wilt
drop
a
tear
of
pity
upon
his
scarp
and
his
counterscarp
;
 
his
glacis
and
his
covered
way
;
 
his
ravelin
and
his
half-
moon
:
 
'
Twas
not
by
idea
,
 
by
Heaven
;
his
life
be
put
in
jeopardy
by
word
.
    
<EOS>
when
my
uncle
Toby
get
his
map
of
Namur
to
his
mind
,
he
begin
immediately
to
apply
himself
,
and
with
the
utmost
diligence
,
to
the
study
of
it
;
for
nothing
being
of
more
importance
to
him
than
his
recovery
,
and
his
recovery
depend
,
as
you
have
read
,
upon
the
passion
and
affection
of
his
mind
,
it
behove
him
to
take
the
nice
care
to
make
himself
so
far
master
of
his
subject
,
as
to
be
able
to
talk
upon
it
without
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
fortnight
's
close
and
painful
application
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
do
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound
,
upon
his
groin
,
no
good
,
 
he
be
enable
,
by
the
help
of
some
marginal
document
at
the
foot
of
the
elephant
,
together
with
Gobesius
's
military
architecture
and
pyroballogy
,
translate
from
the
Flemish
,
to
form
his
discourse
with
passable
perspicuity
;
and
before
he
be
two
full
month
go
,
 
he
be
right
eloquent
upon
it
,
and
could
make
not
only
the
attack
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
with
great
order
;
 
but
have
,
by
that
time
,
go
much
deep
into
the
art
,
than
what
his
first
motive
make
necessary
,
my
uncle
Toby
be
able
to
cross
the
Maes
and
Sambre
;
make
diversion
as
far
as
Vauban
's
line
,
the
abbey
of
Salsines
,
&
c.
and
give
his
visitor
as
distinct
a
history
of
each
of
their
attack
,
as
of
that
of
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
where
he
have
the
honour
to
receive
his
wound
.
  
<EOS>
but
desire
of
knowledge
,
like
the
thirst
of
rich
,
increase
ever
with
the
acquisition
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
my
uncle
Toby
pore
over
his
map
,
the
more
he
take
a
liking
to
it
!
 
<EOS>
by
the
same
process
and
electrical
assimilation
,
as
I
tell
you
,
through
which
I
ween
the
soul
of
connoisseur
themselves
,
by
long
friction

incumbition

have
the
happiness

at

to
get

butterflie

<EOS>
the
more
my
uncle
Toby
drank
of
this
sweet
fountain
of
science
<EOS>
,
the
great
be
the
heat
and
impatience
of
his
thirst
,
so
that
before
the
first
year
of
his
confinement
have
well
go
round
,
there
be
scarce
a
fortified
town
in
Italy
or
Flanders
,
of
which
,
by
one
mean
or
other
,
he
have
not
procure
a
plan
,
read
over
as
he
get
them
,
and
carefully
collate
therewith
the
history
of
their
siege
,
their
demolition
,
their
improvement
,
and
new
work
,
all
which
he
would
read
with
that
intense
application
and
delight
,
that
he
would
forget
himself
,
his
wound
,
his
confinement
,
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
second
year

when
the

<EOS>
towards
the
beginning
of
the
third
year
,
which
be
in
August
,
ninety
-
nine
,
my
uncle
Toby
find
it
necessary
to
understand
a
little
of
projectile
:
  
and
have
judge
it
best
to
draw
his
knowledge
from
the
fountain
-
head
,
he
begin
with
N.
Tartaglia
,
who
it
seem
be
the
first
man
who
detect
the
imposition
of
a
cannon

ball

do
all
that
mischief
under
the
notion
of
a
right
line
 
<EOS>
this
N.
Tartaglia
prove
to
my
uncle
Toby
to
be
an
impossible
thing
.
    
<EOS>
Endless
be
the
search
of
Truth
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
my
uncle
Toby
satisfy
which
road
the
cannon
-
ball
do
not
go
,
but
he
be
insensibly
lead
on
,
and
resolve
in
his
mind
to
enquire
and
find
out
which
road
the
ball
do
go
:
 
for
which
purpose
he
be
oblige
to
set
off
afresh
with
old
Maltus
,
and
study
him
devoutly
.
 
<EOS>
He
proceed
next
to
Galileo
and
Torricellius
,
wherein
,
by
certain
geometrical
rule
,
infallibly
lay
down
,
he
find
the
precise
path
to
be
a
Parabola
 
or
else
an
Hyperbola
,
 
and
that
the
parameter
,
or
latus
rectum
,
of
the
conic
section
of
the
say
path
,
be
to
the
quantity
and
amplitude
in
a
direct
ratio
,
as
the
whole
line
to
the
sine
of
double
the
angle
of
incidence
,
form
by
the
breech
upon
an
horizontal
plane
;
 
and
that
the
semiparameter
,
 
stop
!
<EOS>
my
dear
uncle
Toby
 
stop
!
 
<EOS>
go
not
one
foot
farther
into
this
thorny
and
bewildered
track
,
 
intricate
<EOS>

<EOS>
intricate

labyrinth

<EOS>
intricate

the
trouble

the

this
bewitching
phantom
knowledge
will
bring
upon
thee

<EOS>
o
my

fly

fly
from
it
as

<EOS>
be

<EOS>
thou

<EOS>
o
my
uncle
!
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
I
would
not
give
a
groat
for
that
man
's
knowledge
in
pen
-
craft
,
who
do
not
understand
this
,
 
that
the
good
plain
narrative
in
the
world
,
tack
very
close
to
the
last
spirited
apostrophe
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
would
have
feel
both
cold
and
vapid
upon
the
reader
's
palate
;
 
therefore
I
forthwith
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
,
though
I
be
in
the
middle
of
my
story
.
    
<EOS>
Writers
of
my
stamp
have
one
principle
in
common
with
painter
.
 
<EOS>
where
an
exact
copying
make
our
picture
less
striking
,
we
choose
the
less
evil
;
deem
it
even
more
pardonable
to
trespass
against
truth
,
than
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
to
be
understand
cum
grano
salis
;
but
be
it
as
it
will
,
 
as
the
parallel
be
make
more
for
the
sake
of
let
the
apostrophe
cool
,
than
any
thing
else
,
 
<EOS>
'
tis
not
very
material
whether
upon
any
other
score
the
reader
approve
of
it
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
latter
end
of
the
third
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
perceiving
that
the
parameter
and
semi
-
parameter
of
the
conic
section
anger
his
wound
,
he
leave
off
the
study
of
projectile
in
a
kind
of
a
huff
,
and
betook
himself
to
the
practical
part
of
fortification
only
;
the
pleasure
of
which
,
like
a
spring
hold
back
,
return
upon
him
with
redouble
force
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
year
that
my
uncle
begin
to
break
in
upon
the
daily
regularity
of
a
clean
shirt
,
 
to
dismiss
his
barber
unshaven
,
 
and
to
allow
his
surgeon
scarce
time
sufficient
to
dress
his
wound
,
concern
himself
so
little
about
it
,
as
not
to
ask
him
once
in
seven
time
dress
<EOS>
,
how
it
go
on
:
 
<EOS>
when
,
lo
!
 
<EOS>
all
of
a
sudden
,
for
the
change
be
quick
as
lightning
,
he
begin
to
sigh
heavily
for
his
recovery
,
 
complain
to
my
father
,
grow
impatient
with
the
surgeon
:
 
and
one
morning
,
as
he
hear
his
foot
come
up
stair
,
he
shut
up
his
book
,
and
thrust
aside
his
instrument
,
in
order
to
expostulate
with
him
upon
the
protraction
of
the
cure
,
which
,
he
tell
him
,
may
surely
have
be
accomplish
at
least
by
that
time
:
 
<EOS>
He
dwell
long
upon
the
misery
he
have
undergo
,
and
the
sorrow
of
his
four
year
melancholy
imprisonment
;
 
add
,
that
have
it
not
be
for
the
kind
look
and
fraternal
chearing
of
the
good
of
brother
,
  
he
have
long
since
sink
under
his
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
be
by

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
eloquence
bring
tear
into
his
eye
;
 
'
twas
unexpected
:
 
My
uncle
Toby
,
by
nature
be
not
eloquent
;
 
it
have
the
great
effect
:
 
<EOS>
the
surgeon
be
confound
;
 
not
that
there
want
ground
for
such
,
or
great
mark
of
impatience
,
 
but
'
twas
unexpected
too
;
in
the
four
year
he
have
attend
him
,
he
have
never
see
any
thing
like
it
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
carriage
;
he
have
never
once
drop
one
fretful
or
discontent
word
;
 
he
have
be
all
patience
,
 
all
submission
.
    
<EOS>
We
lose
the
right
of
complain
sometimes
by
forbear
it
;
 
but
we
often
treble
the
force
:
 
<EOS>
the
surgeon
be
astonish
;
but
much
more
so
,
when
he
hear
my
uncle
Toby
go
on
,
and
peremptorily
insist
upon
his
healing
up
the
wound
directly
,
 
or
send
for
Monsieur
Ronjat
,
the
king
's
serjeant-
surgeon
,
to
do
it
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
desire
of
life
and
health
be
implant
in
man
's
nature
;
 
the
love
of
liberty
and
enlargement
be
a
sister
-
passion
to
it
:
 
<EOS>
these
my
uncle
Toby
have
in
common
with
his
specie
 
and
either
of
them
have
be
sufficient
to
account
for
his
earnest
desire
to
get
well
and
out
of
door
;
 
but
I
have
tell
you
before
,
that
nothing
work
with
our
family
after
the
common
way
;
 
and
from
the
time
and
manner
in
which
this
eager
desire
shew
itself
in
the
present
case
,
the
penetrating
reader
will
suspect
there
be
some
other
cause
or
crotchet
for
it
in
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby

:
 
<EOS>
there
be
so
,
and
'
tis
the
subject
of
the
next
chapter
to
set
forth
what
that
cause
and
crotchet
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
when
that
be
do
,
'
twill
be
time
to
return
back
to
the
parlour
fire
-
side
,
where
we
leave
my
uncle
Toby
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
.
    
<EOS>
when
a
man
give
himself
up
to
the
government
of
a
rule
passion
,
 
or
,
in
other
word
,
when
his
Hobby
-
Horse
grow
headstrong
,
 
farewell
cool
reason
and
fair
discretion
!
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
wound
be
near
well
,
and
as
soon
as
the
surgeon
recover
his
surprize
,
and
could
get
leave
to
say
as
much
 
<EOS>
he
tell
him
,
'
twas
just
begin
to
incarnate
;
and
that
if
no
fresh
exfoliation
happen
,
which
there
be
no
sign
of
,
 
it
would
be
dry
up
in
five
or
six
week
.
 
<EOS>
the
sound
of
as
many
Olympiads
,
twelve
hour
before
,
would
have
convey
an
idea
of
short
duration
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
succession
of
his
idea
be
now
rapid
,
 
he
broil
with
impatience
to
put
his
design
in
execution
;
 
and
so
,
without
consult
farther
with
any
soul
live
,
  
which
,
by
the
bye
,
I
think
be
right
,
when
you
be
predetermine
to
take
no
one
soul
's
advice
,
 
he
privately
order
Trim
,
his
man
,
to
pack
up
a
bundle
of
lint
and
dressing
,
and
hire
a
chariot
-
and
-
four
to
be
at
the
door
exactly
by
twelve
o'clock
that
day
,
when
he
know
my
father
would
be
upon
"
Change
.
 
<EOS>
so
leave
a
bank
-
note
upon
the
table
for
the
surgeon
's
care
of
him
,
and
a
letter
of
tender
thank
for
his
brother
's
 
he
pack
up
his
map
,
his
book
of
fortification
,
his
instrument
,
&
c.
and
by
the
help
of
a
crutch
on
one
side
,
and
trim
on
the
other
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
embark
for
Shandy
-
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
the
reason
,
or
rather
the
rise
of
this
sudden
demigration
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
the
table
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
room
,
and
at
which
,
the
night
before
this
change
happen
,
he
be
sit
with
his
map
,
&
c.
about
him
 
be
somewhat
of
the
small
,
for
that
infinity
of
great
and
small
instrument
of
knowledge
which
usually
lie
crowd
upon
it
 
<EOS>
he
have
the
accident
,
in
reach
over
for
his
tobacco
-
box
,
to
throw
down
his
compass
,
and
in
stoop
to
take
the
compass
up
,
with
his
sleeve
he
throw
down
his
case
of
instrument
and
snuffer
;
 
and
<EOS>
as
the
dice
take
a
run
against
him
,
in
his
endeavouring
to
catch
the
snuffer
in
fall
,
 
he
thrust
Monsieur
Blondel
off
the
table
,
and
Count
de
Pagon
o'top
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
@@@twas
to
no

for
a

<EOS>
,
lame
as
my

be
,
to

dark
line
in

<EOS>
the

his

however

be
so
perfectly
respectful

My

stroke
his

compare
to
what
your

by
ourselves
,
and
have
but
a

with
its
exact
line
and
angle
  
that
I
could
do
very
well
,
quoth
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
begin
with
the

if
your

tell
me
the
proper
depth
and
breadth
 
I
can
to
a
hair
's
breadth
,
Trim
,
reply
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
throw
out
the
earth
upon
this
hand
towards
the
town
for
the
scarp
,
 
and
on
that
hand
towards
the
campaign
for
the
counterscarp
.
 
<EOS>
very
right
,
Trim
,
quoth
my

<EOS>
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
slope
them
to
your

,
 
an
'
please
your

I
would
face
the
glacis
,
as
the
fine
fortification
be
do
in
flander
,
with
sod
,
  
and
as
your
honour
know
they
should
be
,
 
and
I
would
make
the
wall
and
parapet
with
sod
too
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
engineer
call
them
gazon

Trim

say
my

<EOS>
whether
they
be
gazon

sod
,
be
not
much
matter
,
reply
Trim
;
your

know
they
be
ten

beyond

I

they
be

<EOS>
trim
in
some
respect

for

ball
enter
into

without

any

down
with
it

which
may
fill
the
fosse
,
(
as

the
case
at
St.

and
facilitate
the
passage
over

Your

well
than

to
let
the
bespeaking

let
us

go
into

I
would
work
under
your

direction
like
a
horse

and
make
fortification
for
you
something
like
a
tansy
,
with
all
their
battery
,
sap
,
ditch

and
palisadoe
,
that
it

be

My

Corporal

description
have
fire
his
imagination

my

Toby
could
not
shut
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
he
consider
it
,
the
more
bewitch
the
scene
appear
to
him
;
 
so
that
,
two
full
hour
before
day
-
light
,
he
have
come
to
a
final
determination
and
have
concert
the
whole
plan
of
his
and
Corporal
Trim
's
decampment
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
have
a
little
neat
country
-
house
of
his
own
,
in
the
village
where
my
father
's
estate
lie
at
Shandy
,
which
have
be
leave
him
by
an
old
uncle
,
with
a
small
estate
of
about
one
hundred
pound
a
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
behind
this
house
,
and
contiguous
to
it
,
be
a
kitchen
-
garden
of
about
half
an
acre
,
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
and
cut
off
from
it
by
a
tall
yew
hedge
,
be
a
bowling
-
green
,
contain
just
about
as
much
ground
as
Corporal
Trim
wish
for
;
 
so
that
as
Trim
utter
the
word
,
"
a
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
to
do
what
they
would
with
,
"
 
this
identical
bowling
-
green
instantly
present
itself
,
and
become
curiously
paint
all
at
once
,
upon
the
retina
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
fancy
;
 
which
be
the
physical
cause
of
make
him
change
colour
,
or
at
least
of
heighten
his
blush
,
to
that
immoderate
degree
I
speak
of
.
  
<EOS>
never
do
lover
post
down
to
a
beloved
mistress
with
more
heat
and
expectation
,
than
my

Toby
do
,
to
enjoy

I

shelter

I

how

what
can

do

I

reply
my

Toby

taking
,
as
I
tell
you
,
his
pipe
from
his

,
and
strike
the

out

it

not

if
we

what

my

and
where

<EOS>
Sir

she
be
run
the

Obadiah
,
to
fetch
the

midwife

<EOS>
then
saddle
a

quoth
my

do
you
go

It

strange

say
my

address
himself
to
my

Toby
,
as
Obadiah
shut
the
door

as
there
be
so
expert
an

Dr.

so
near

that
my

in

astonishment

<EOS>
to

say
my

,
of
a

live
to
your
age

brother

and
know
so
little
about
woman
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
at

reply
my

Toby
:

and
I

continue
he
,
that
the
shock
I
receive
the
year
after
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
in
my
affair
with
widow
Wadman

which
shock
you
know
I
should
not
have
receive
,
but
from
my
total
ignorance
of
the
sex
,
 
have
give
me
just
cause
to
say

that
I
neither
know
nor
do
pretend
to
know
any

their

<EOS>
Methinks
,
brother

reply
my

you
may
,
at

,
know
so
much
as
the
right
end
of
a
woman
from
the
wrong

<EOS>
It
be
say
in
Aristotle
's
Master
Piece

"
that
when
a
man
doth
think
of
any
thing

be
past

he
looketh
down
upon

that
when
he
thinketh
of
something
that
be
to

he
looketh
up
towards
the
heavens

<EOS>
My

I

neither

<EOS>

I
know
no

keep
his

bad

<EOS>
this
month
together

I
be
sure
I
should
not

it
out

then

I
will
tell

every

now

be
the

different
 
<EOS>
here
a
devil
of
a
rap
at

snap
my

's
definition
(
like
his
tobacco

in
two

and
,
at
the

time
,
crush
the
head
of
as
notable
and
curious
a
dissertation
as
ever
be
engender
in
the
womb
of
speculation
;
 
it
be
some
month
before
my
father
could
get
an
opportunity
to
be
safely
deliver
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
and
,
at
this
hour
,
it
be
a
thing
full
as
problematical
as
the
subject
of
the
dissertation
itself
,
 
<EOS>
(
consider
the
confusion
and
distress
of
our
domestick
misadventure
,
which
be
now
come
thick
one

whether
I
shall
be
able

not

<EOS>
It
be
about
an
hour
and
a
half
's
tolerable
good
reading
since
my
uncle
Toby
ring
the
bell
,
when
Obadiah
be
order
to
saddle
a
horse
,
and
go
for
Dr.
Slop
,
the
man
-
midwife
;
 
so
that
no
one
can
say
,
with
reason
,
that
I
have
not
allow
Obadiah
time
enough
,
poetically
speak
,
and
consider
the
emergency
too
,
both
to
go
and
come
;
 
though
,
morally
and
truly
speak
,
the
man
perhaps
have
scarce
have
time
to
get
on
his
boot
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
hypercritick
will
go
upon
this
;
and
be
resolve
after
all
to
take
a
pendulum
,
and
measure
the
true
distance
betwixt
the
ringing
of
the
bell
,
and
the
rap
at
the
door
;
 
and
,
after
find
it
to
be
no
more
than
two
minute
,
thirteen
second
,
and
three
-
fifth
,
 
should
take
upon
him
to
insult
over
me
for
such
a
breach
in
the
unity
,
or
rather
probability
of
time
;
 
I
would
remind
him
,
that
the
idea
of
duration
,
and
of
its
simple
mode
,
be
get
merely
from
the
train
and
succession
of
our
idea
 
and
be
the
true
scholastic
pendulum
,
 
and
by
which
,
as
a
scholar
,
I
will
be
try
in
this
matter
,
 
abjure
and
detest
the
jurisdiction
of
all
other
pendulum
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
therefore
desire
him
to
consider
that
it
be
but
poor
eight
mile
from
Shandy
-
Hall
to
Dr.
Slop
,
the
man
-
midwife
's
house
:
 
and
that
whilst
Obadiah
have
be
go
those
say
mile
and
back
<EOS>
,
I
have
bring
my
uncle
Toby
from
Namur
,
quite
across
all
flander
,
into
England
:
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
have
him
ill
upon
my
hand
near
four
year
;
 
and
have
since
travel
him
and
Corporal
Trim
in
a
chariot
-
and
-
four
,
a
journey
of
near
two
hundred
mile
down
into
Yorkshire
.
 
<EOS>
all
which
put
together
,
must
have
prepare
the
reader
's
imagination
for
the
entrance
of
Dr.
Slop
upon
the
stage
,
 
as
much
,
at
least
(
I
hope
)
as
a
dance
,
a
song
,
or
a
concerto
between
the
act
.
  
<EOS>
if
my
hypercritick
be
intractable
,
alledging
,
that
two
minute
and
thirteen
second
be
no
more
than
two
minute
and
thirteen
second
,
 
when
I
have
say
all
I
can
about
them
;
and
that
this
plea
,
though
it
may
save
me
dramatically
,
will
damn
me
biographically
,
render
my
book
from
this
very
moment
,
a
profess
romance
,
which
,
before
,
be
a
book
apocryphal
:
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
thus
press
 
<EOS>
I
then
put
an
end
to
the
whole
objection
and
controversy
about
it
all
at
once
,
 
by
acquaint
him
,
that
Obadiah
have
not
get
above
threescore
yard
from
the
stable
-
yard
,
before
he
meet
with
Dr.
Slop
;
 
and
indeed
he
give
a
dirty
proof
that
he
have
meet
with
him
,
and
be
within
an
ace
of
give
a
tragical
one
too
.
  
<EOS>
imagine
to
yourself
;
 
but
this
have
better
begin
a
new
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Imagine
to
yourself
a
little
squat
<EOS>
,
uncourtly
figure
of
a
Doctor
Slop
,
of
about
four
foot
and
a
half
perpendicular
height
,
with
a
breadth
of
back
,
and
a
sesquipedality
of
belly
,
which
may
have
do
honour
to
a
serjeant
in
the
horse
-
guard
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
out
-
line
of
Dr.
Slop
's
figure
,
which
 
if
you
have
read
Hogarth
's
analysis
of
beauty
,
and
if
you
have
not
,
I
wish
you
would
;
 
you
must
know
,
may
as
certainly
be
caricature
,
and
convey
to
the
mind
by
three
stroke
as
three
hundred
.
  
<EOS>
imagine
such
a
one
,
 
for
such
,
I
say
,
be
the
outline
of
Dr.
Slop
's
figure
,
come
slowly
along
,
foot
by
foot
,
waddle
thro
'
the
dirt
upon
the
vertebrae
of
a
little
diminutive
pony
,
of
a
pretty
colour
 
<EOS>
but
of
strength
,
 
alack
!
 
<EOS>
scarce
able
to
have
make
an
amble
of
it
,
under
such
a
fardel
<EOS>
,
have
the
road
be
in
an
amble
condition
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
.
  
<EOS>
imagine
to
yourself
,
Obadiah
mount
upon
a
strong
monster
of
a
coach-
horse
,
prick
into
a
full
gallop
,
and
make
all
practicable
speed
the
adverse
way
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Sir
,
let
me
interest
you
a
moment
in
this
description
.
  
<EOS>
have
Dr.
Slop
beheld
Obadiah
a
mile
off
,
post
in
a
narrow
lane
directly
towards
him
,
at
that
monstrous
rate
,
 
splash
and
plunge
like
a
devil
thro
'
thick
and
thin
,
as
he
approach
,
would
not
such
a
phaenomenon
,
with
such
a
vortex
of
mud
and
water
move
along
with
it
,
round
its
axis
<EOS>
,
 
have
be
a
subject
of
juster
apprehension
to
Dr.
Slop
in
his
situation
,
than
the
bad
of
Whiston
's
comet
?
 
<EOS>
to
say
nothing
of
the
Nucleus
;
that
is
,
of
Obadiah
and
the
coach
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
idea
,
the
vortex
alone
of
'em
be
enough
to
have
involve
and
carry
,
if
not
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
at
least
the
doctor
's
pony
,
quite
away
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
then
do
you
think
must
the
terror
and
hydrophobia
of
Dr.
Slop
have
be
,
when
you
read
(
which
you
be
just
go
to
do
)
that
he
be
advance
thus
warily
along
towards
Shandy
-
Hall
,
and
have
approach
to
within
sixty
yard
of
it
,
and
within
five
yard
of
a
sudden
turn
,
make
by
an
acute
angle
of
the
garden
-
wall
,
 
and
in
the
dirty
part
of
a
dirty
lane
,
 
when
Obadiah
and
his
coach
-
horse
turn
the
corner
,
rapid
,
furious
,
 
pop
,
 
full
upon
him
!
 
<EOS>
nothing
,
I
think
,
in
nature
,
can
be
suppose
more
terrible
than
such
a
rencounter
,
 
so
imprompt
!
<EOS>
so
ill
prepared
to
stand
the
shock
of
it
as
Dr.
Slop
be
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
Dr.
Slop
do
?
 
<EOS>
he
cross
himself
+
  
<EOS>
pugh
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
,
Sir
,
be
a
Papist
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
;
he
have
better
have
keep
hold
of
the
pummel
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
so
;
 
<EOS>
nay
,
as
it
happen
,
he
have
better
have
do
nothing
at
all
;
for
in
cross
himself
he
let
go
his
whip
,
 
and
in
attempt
to
save
his
whip
betwixt
his
knee
and
his
saddle
's
skirt
,
<EOS>
as
it
slip
,
he
lose
his
stirrup
,
 
in
lose
which
he
lose
his
seat
;
 
and
in
the
multitude
of
all
these
loss
(
which
,
by
the
bye
,
shew
what
little
advantage
there
be
in
cross
)
the
unfortunate
doctor
lose
his
presence
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
without
wait
for
Obadiah
's
onset
,
he
leave
his
pony
to
its
destiny
,
tumble
off
it
diagonally
,
something
in
the
stile
and
manner
of
a
pack
of
wool
,
and
without
any
other
consequence
from
the
fall
,
save
that
of
be
leave
(
as
it
would
have
be
)
with
the
broad
part
of
him
sink
about
twelve
inch
deep
in
the
mire
.
  
<EOS>
Obadiah
pull'd
<EOS>
off
his
cap
twice
to
Dr.
Slop
;
 
once
as
he
be
fall
,
 
and
then
again
when
he
see
him
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Ill
-
time
complaisance
<EOS>
;
 
have
not
the
fellow
better
have
stop
his
horse
,
and
get
off
and
<EOS>
help'd
him
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
he
do
all
that
his
situation
would
allow
;
 
but
<EOS>
the
Momentum
of
the
coach-
horse
be
so
great
,
that
Obadiah
could
not
do
it
all
at
once
;
he
ride
in
a
circle
<EOS>
three
time
round
Dr.
Slop
,
before
he
could
fully
accomplish
it
any
<EOS>
how
;
 
and
at
the
last
,
when
he
do
stop
his
beast
,
'
twas
do
with
such
an
explosion
of
mud
,
that
Obadiah
have
well
have
be
a
league
off
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
never
be
a
Dr.
Slop
so
belute
,
and
so
transubstantiated
,
since
that
affair
come
into
fashion
.
    
<EOS>
when
Dr.
Slop
enter
the
back
parlour
,
where
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
be
discourse
upon
the
nature
of
woman
,
 
it
be
hard
to
determine
whether
Dr.
Slop
's
figure
,
or
Dr.
Slop
's
presence
,
occasion
more
surprize
to
them
;
for
as
the
accident
happen
so
near
the
house
,
as
not
to
make
it
worth
while
for
Obadiah
to
remount
him
,
 
Obadiah
have
lead
him
in
as
he
be
,
unwiped
,
unappointed
,
unanneale
,
with
all
his
stain
and
blotch
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
like
Hamlet
's
ghost
,
motionless
and
speechless
,
for
a
full
minute
and
a
half
at
the
parlour
-
door
<EOS>
(
Obadiah
still
hold
his
hand
)
with
all
the
majesty
of
mud
.
 
<EOS>
His
hinder
part
,
upon
which
he
have
receive
his
fall
,
totally
besmear
,
 
and
in
every
other
part
of
him
,
blotch
over
in
such
a
manner
with
Obadiah
's
explosion
,
that
you
would
have
swear
(
without
mental
reservation
)
that
every
grain
of
it
have
take
effect
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
fair
opportunity
for
my
uncle
Toby
to
have
triumph
over
my
father
in
his
turn
;
 
for
no
mortal
,
who
have
behold
Dr.
Slop
in
that
pickle
,
could
have
dissent
from
so
much
,
at
least
,
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
opinion
,
"
that
mayhap
<EOS>
his
sister
may
not
care
to
let
such
a
Dr.
Slop
come
so
near
her
.
.
..
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
Argumentum
ad
hominem
;
and
if
my
uncle
Toby
be
not
very
expert
at
it
,
you
may
think
,
he
may
not
care
to
use
it
.
 
<EOS>
no
;
the
reason
be
,
 
'
twa
not
his
nature
to
insult
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
's
presence
at
that
time
,
be
no
less
problematical
than
the
mode
of
it
;
tho
'
<EOS>
it
be
certain
,
one
moment
's
reflexion
in
my
father
may
have
solve
it
;
for
he
have
apprize
Dr.
Slop
but
<EOS>
the
week
before
,
that
my
mother
be
at
her
full
reckoning
;
and
as
the
doctor
have
hear
nothing
since
,
'
twas
natural
and
very
political
too
in
him
,
to
have
take
a
ride
to
Shandy
-
Hall
,
as
he
do
,
merely
to
see
how
matter
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
father
's
mind
take
unfortunately
a
wrong
turn
in
the
investigation
;
run
,
like
the
hypercritick
's
,
altogether
upon
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
rap
upon
the
door
,
 
measure
their
distance
,
and
keep
his
mind
so
intent
upon
the
operation
,
as
to
have
power
to
think
of
nothing
else
,
  
common
-
place
infirmity
of
the
great
mathematician
!
<EOS>
work
with
might
and
main
at
the
demonstration
,
and
so
waste
all
their
strength
upon
it
,
that
they
have
none
leave
in
them
to
draw
the
corollary
,
to
do
good
with
.
  
<EOS>
the
ringing
of
the
bell
,
and
the
rap
upon
the
door
,
strike
likewise
strong
upon
the
sensorium
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
but
it
excite
a
very
different
train
of
thought
;
 
the
two
irreconcileable
pulsation
instantly
bring
Stevinus
,
the
great
engineer
,
along
with
them
,
into
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
what
business
Stevinus
have
in
this
affair
,
 
be
the
great
problem
of
all
:
 
<EOS>
It
shall
be
solve
,
 
but
not
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Writing
,
when
properly
manage
(
as
you
may
be
sure
I
think
mine
be
)
<EOS>
be
but
a
different
name
for
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
as
no
one
,
who
know
what
he
be
about
in
good
company
,
would
venture
to
talk
all
;
 
so
<EOS>
no
author
,
who
understand
the
just
boundary
of
decorum
and
good
-
breeding
,
would
presume
to
think
all
:
 
<EOS>
the
true
respect
which
you
can
pay
to
the
reader
's
understanding
,
be
to
halve
this
matter
amicably
,
and
leave
him
something
to
imagine
,
in
his
turn
,
as
well
as
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
be
eternally
pay
him
compliment
of
this
kind
,
and
do
all
that
lie
in
my
power
to
keep
his
imagination
as
busy
as
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
his
turn
now
;
 
<EOS>
I
have
give
an
ample
description
of
Dr.
Slop
's
sad
overthrow
,
and
of
his
sad
appearance
in
the
back
-
parlour
;
 
<EOS>
his
imagination
must
now
go
on
with
it
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
let
the
reader
imagine
then
,
that
Dr.
Slop
have
tell
his
tale
 
and
in
what
word
,
and
with
what
aggravation
,
his
fancy
choose
;
 
let
him
suppose
,
that
Obadiah
have
tell
his
tale
also
,
and
with
such
rueful
look
of
affected
concern
,
as
he
think
best
will
contrast
the
two
figure
as
they
stand
by
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
let
him
imagine
,
that
my
father
have
step
up
stair
to
see
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
to
conclude
this
work
of
imagination
,
 
let
him
imagine
the
doctor
wash
,
 
rub
down
,
and
condole
,
 
felicitate
,
 
get
into
a
pair
of
Obadiah
's
pump
,
step
forwards
towards
the
door
,
upon
the
very
point
of
enter
upon
action
.
  
<EOS>
truce
!
 
<EOS>
truce
,
good
Dr.
Slop
!
 
<EOS>
stay
thy
obstetrick
hand
;
 
return
it
safe
into
thy
bosom
to
keep
it
warm
;
 
little
dost
thou
know
<EOS>
what
obstacle
,
  
little
dost
thou
think
what
hidden
cause
,
retard
its
operation
!
 
<EOS>
Hast
thou
,
Dr.
Slop
,
 
hast
thou
be
entrust
with
the
secret
article
of
the
solemn
treaty
which
have
bring
thee
into
this
place
?
 
<EOS>
Art
thou
aware
that
at
this
instant
,
a
daughter
of
Lucina
be
put
obstetrically
over
thy
head
?
 
<EOS>
alas
!
 
<EOS>
'
tis
too
true

<EOS>
besides

great
son
of
Pilumnus

<EOS>
what
canst

<EOS>
Thou

at

ring

make

and
quoth
<EOS>
my

I

<EOS>
Your
sudden
and
unexpected
arrival

quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
address
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
,
(
all
three
of
them
sit
down
to
the
fire
together
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
begin
to
speak
)
 
<EOS>
instantly
bring
the
great
Stevinus
into
my
head
,
who
,
you
must
know
,
be
a
favourite
author
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
add
my
father
,
make
use
of
the
argument
Ad
Crumenam
,
 
I
will
lay
twenty
guinea
to
a
single
crown
-
piece
(
which
will
serve
to
give
away
to
Obadiah
when
he
get
back
)
<EOS>
that
this
same
Stevinus
be
some
engineer
or
other
 
or
have
write
something
or
other
,
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
upon
the
science
of
fortification
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
so
,
 
reply
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
say
my
father
,
though
,
for
the
soul
of
me
,
I
can
not
see
what
kind
of
connection
there
can
be
betwixt
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
's
sudden
coming
,
and
a
discourse
upon
fortification
;
 
yet
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
fear'd
it
.
 
<EOS>
talk
of
what
we
will
,
brother
,
 
or
<EOS>
let
the
occasion
be
never
so
foreign
or
unfit
for
the
subject
,
 
you
be
sure
to
bring
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
<EOS>
brother
Toby
,
continue
my
father
,
 
I
declare
I
would
not
have
my
head
so
full
of
curtin
and
horn
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
dare
say
you
would
not
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
interrupt
him
,
and
laugh
most
immoderately
at
his
pun
.
  
<EOS>
Dennis
the
critic
could
not
detest
and
abhor
a
pun
,
or
the
insinuation
of
a
pun
,
more
cordially
than
my
father
;
 
he
would
grow
testy
upon
it
at
any
time
;
 
but
to
be
break
in
upon
by
one
,
in
a
serious
discourse
,
be
as
bad
,
he
would
say
,
as
a
fillip
upon
the
nose
;
 
he
see
no
difference
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
address
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
,
 
<EOS>
the
curtin
my
brother
Shandy
mention
here
,
have
nothing
to
do
with
beadstead
;
 
tho
'
,
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
Du
Cange
say
,
"
that
bed
-
curtain
,
in
all
probability
,
have
take
their
name
from
them
;
"
 
nor
have
the
horn
-
work
he
speak
of
,
any
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
horn
-
work
of
cuckoldom
:
 
but
the
Curtin
,
Sir
,
be
the
word
we
use
in
fortification
,
for
that
part
of
the
wall
or
rampart
which
lie
between
the
two
bastion
and
join
them
 
<EOS>
Besiegers
seldom
offer
to
carry
on
their
attack
directly
against
the
curtin
,
for
this
reason
,
because
they
be
so
well
flank
.
 
<EOS>
(
'
Tis
the
case
of
other
curtain
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
laugh
.
)
 
<EOS>
however
,
continue
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
make
them
sure
,
we
generally
choose
to
place
ravelin
before
them
,
take
care
only
to
extend
them
beyond
the
fosse
or
ditch
:
 
<EOS>
the
common
man
,
who
know
very
little
of
fortification
,
confound
the
ravelin
and
the
half
-
moon
together
,
  
tho
<EOS>
"
they
be
very
different
thing
;
 
not
in
their
figure
or
construction
,
for
we

them
exactly
alike

in
all
point
;
for
they
always
consist
of
two
face
,
make
a
salient
angle
,
with
the
gorge
,
not
straight
,
but
in
form
of
a
crescent
;
 
<EOS>
where
then
lie
the
difference
?
<EOS>
(
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
a
little
testily
.
)
 
<EOS>
in
their
situation
,
answer
my
uncle
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
for
when
a
ravelin
,
brother
,
stand
before
the
curtin
,
it
be
a
ravelin
;
and
when
a
ravelin
stand
before
a
bastion
,
then
the
ravelin
be
not
a
ravelin
;
 
it
be
a
half
-
moon
;
 
a
half
-
moon
likewise
be
a
half
-
moon
,
and
no
more
,
so
long
as
it
stand
before
its
bastion
;
 
but
be
it
to
change
place
,
and
get
before
the
curtin
,
 
'
twould
be
no
longer
a
half
-
moon
;
a
half
-
moon
,
in
that
case
,
be
not
a
half
-
moon
;
 
'
tis
no
more
than
a
ravelin
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
quoth
my
father
,
that
the
noble
science
of
defence
have
its
weak
side
 
as
well
as
other
.
   
<EOS>
as
for
the
horn
-
work
(
high
!
ho
!
<EOS>
sigh'd
<EOS>
my
father
)
<EOS>
which
,
continue
my
uncle
Toby
,
my
brother
be
speak
of
<EOS>
,
they
be
a
very
considerable
part
of
an
outwork
;
 
they
be
call
by
the
french
engineer
,
ouvrage
a
corne
,
and
we
generally
make
them
to
cover
such
place
as
we
suspect
to
be
weak
than
the
rest
;
 
'
tis
form
by
two
epaulment
or
demi
-
bastion
 
they
be
very
pretty
,
 
and
if
you
will
take
a
walk
,
I
will
engage
to
shew
you
one
well
worth
your
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
continue
my
uncle
Toby
,
when
we
crown
them
,
  
they
be
much
strong
,
but
then
they
be
very
expensive
,
and
take
up
a
great
deal
of
ground
,
so
that
,
in
my
opinion
,
they
be
most
of
use
to
cover
or
defend
the
head
of
a
camp
;
otherwise
the
double
tenaille
 
<EOS>
by
the
mother
who
bear
us
!
 
<EOS>
brother
Toby
,
quoth
my
father
,
not
able
to
hold
out
any
longer
,
 
you
would
provoke
a
saint
;
 
here
<EOS>
have
you
get
us
,
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
,
not
only
souse
into
the
middle
of
the
old
subject
again
:
 
<EOS>
but
so
full
be
your
head
of
these
confound
work
,
that
though
my
wife
be
this
moment
in
the
pain
of
labour
,
and
you
hear
her
cry
out

yet
nothing

serve
you

to
carry
off
the

<EOS>
Accoucheur

if
you

quoth
Dr.
Slop

<EOS>
with
all
my

reply
my

,
I
do
not
care
what
they
call
you
,
 
but
I
wish
the
whole
science
of
fortification
,
with
all
its
inventor

at
the

it
have
be
the
death
of

and
it

be
mine
in

<EOS>
I

I

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
be
a
man
patient
of
injury
;
 
not
from
want
of
courage
,
 
I
have
tell
you
in
a
former
chapter
,
"
that
he
be
a
man
of
courage
:
"
 
and
will
add
here
,
<EOS>
that
where
just
occasion
present
,
or
call
it
forth
,
 
I
know
no
man
under
whose
arm
I
would
have
sooner
take
shelter
;
 
nor
do
this
arise
from
any
insensibility
or
obtuseness
of
his
intellectual
part

<EOS>
for
he
feel
this
insult
of
my

be
as
feelingly
as
a

could
do
;
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
of

placid
nature

<EOS>
no

all
be
mix

my

Toby
have
scarce
a
heart
to
retaliate
upon
a

<EOS>
Go
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
one
day
at
dinner
,
to
an
over

grow
one
which
have
buzz
about
his

and
torment
him
cruelly
all
dinner

time

and
which
after
infinite
attempt

he
have
catch
at
last

as
it
fly
by
him

I
will
not
hurt
thee
,
say
my

Toby

rise
from
his

and
go
across
the
room

with
the
fly
in
his
hand
,
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
hurt
a

of
thy

<EOS>
Go
,
say
he
,
lift
up
the
sash
,
and
open
his

as
he

to
let

go

poor

get
thee
go
<EOS>
,
why
should
I
hurt
thee

<EOS>
this

surely
be
wide
enough
to
hold
both
thee
and
me

<EOS>
I
be
but
ten
year
old
when
this
happen
:
 
but
<EOS>
whether
it
be
,
that
the
action
itself
be
more
in
unison
to
my
nerve
at
that
age
of
pity
,
which
instantly
set
my
whole
frame
into
one
vibration
of
most
pleasurable
sensation
;
 
or
how
far
the
manner
and
expression
of
it
may
go
towards
it
;
 
or
in
what
degree
,
or
by
what
secret
magick
,
 
a
tone
of
voice
and
harmony
of
movement
,
attune
by
mercy
,
may
find
a
passage
to
my
heart
,
I
know
not
;
 
this
I
know
,
that
the
lesson
of
universal
good
-
will
then
taught
and
imprint
by
my
uncle
Toby
,
have
never
since
be
wear
out
of
my
mind
:
 
<EOS>
and
tho
'
<EOS>
I
would
not
depreciate
what
the
study
of
the
Literae
humaniore
,
at
the
university
,
have
do
for
me
in
that
respect
,
or
discredit
the
other
help
of
an
expensive
education
bestow
upon
me
,
both
at
home
and
abroad
since
;
 
yet
I
often
think
that
I
owe
one
half
of
my
philanthropy
to
that
one
accidental
impression
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
to
serve
for
parent
and
governor
instead
of
a
whole
volume
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
give
the
reader
this
stroke
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
picture
,
by
the
instrument
with
which
I
draw
the
other
part
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
that
take
in
no
more
than
the
mere
Hobby
-
Horsical
likeness
:
 
this
be
a
part
of
his
moral
character
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
,
in
this
patient
endurance
of
wrong
,
which
I
mention
,
be
very
different
,
as
the
reader
must
long
ago
have
note
;
he
have
a
much
more
acute
and
quick
sensibility
of
nature
,
attend
with
a
little
soreness
of
temper
;
tho
'
this
never
transport
him
to
any
thing
which
look
like
malignancy
:
 
yet
in
the
little
rub
and
vexation
of
life
,
'
twas
apt
to
shew
itself
in
a
drollish
and
witty
kind
of
peevishness
:
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
frank
and
generous
in
his
nature
;
 
at
all
time
open
to
conviction
;
and
<EOS>
in
the
little
ebullition
of
this
subacid
humour
towards
other
,
but
particularly
towards
my
uncle
Toby
,
whom
he
truly
love
:
 
he
would
feel
more
pain
,
ten
time
tell
(
except
in
the
affair
of
my
aunt
Dinah
,
or
where
an
hypothesis

than
what
he
ever
give

<EOS>
the
character
of
the
two

in
this
view

them

reflect
light
upon
each
other

and
appear
with
great
advantage
in
this
affair
which
arise
about
Stevinus
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
the
reader
,
if
he
keep
a
Hobby
-
Horse
,
 
that
a
man
's
Hobby-
Horse
be
as
tender
a
part
as
he
have
about
him
;
and
that
these
unprovoked
stroke
at
my
uncle
Toby

could
not
be
unfelt
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
no
:
 
<EOS>
as
I

above

my

Toby
do
feel
them
,
and
very
sensibly
too

<EOS>
Pray

Sir

what

<EOS>
how
do
he
behave

<EOS>
o

Sir

<EOS>
it
be
great
:
 
<EOS>
for
as
soon
as
my
father
have
do
insult
his
Hobby
-
Horse
,
 
he
turn
his
head
without
the
least
emotion
,
from
Dr.
Slop
,
to
whom
he
be
address
his
discourse
,
and
look
up
into
my

face
,
with
a
countenance
spread
over
with
so
much
good

nature
;
 
so
placid

so
fraternal

so
inexpressibly
tender
towards

penetrate
my

<EOS>
He
rise
up
hastily
from
his
chair
,
and
seize
hold
of
both
my

Toby

hand
as
he
speak
:
 
Brother
Toby

:
 
<EOS>
I
beg
thy
pardon

forgive
<EOS>

I
pray
thee

My

you

have
it
be
ten

<EOS>
but
'
tis
ungenerous

reply
my
father
,
to
hurt
any
man

a

worse
;
 
but
to
hurt
a
brother
of
such
gentle
manner

so
unprovoking

<EOS>
Brother
Shandy
,
answer
my

Toby
,
look
wistfully
in
his
face
,
  
you
be
much
mistake
in
this
point
:
 
for
you
do

pleasure
very
much

in

<EOS>
Pshaw

<EOS>
say
my

'
<EOS>
tis
not

<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter

my

my

Toby

both
standing

like
Brutus

at
the
close

<EOS>
as

exactly
follow
his

that
before

he
ring
the
bell
,
to
order
Corporal
Trim

who
be

home
for
Stevinus

my

Toby

house
be
no

off
than
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
some
man
would
have
drop
the
subject
of
Stevinus
;
 
but
my
uncle
Toby
have
no
resentment
in
his
heart

and
he
go
on
with
the
subject

to
shew
my

that
he
have
none

<EOS>
Your
sudden
appearance

Dr.

quoth
my

,
resume
the
discourse

instantly
bring
Stevinus
into
my
head

<EOS>
(
My
father
,
you
may
be
sure
,
do
not
offer
to
lay
any
more
wager
upon
Stevinus
's
head
.
)
 
<EOS>
because
,
continue
my
uncle
Toby
,
the
celebrated
sailing
chariot
,
which
belong
to
Prince
Maurice
,
and
be
of
such
wonderful
contrivance
and
velocity
,
as
to

that
great
mathematician

engineer

<EOS>
You
may
have
spare
your
servant
the
trouble
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
(
as
the
fellow
be
lame
)
of
go
for
Stevinus
's
account
of
it
,
because
in
my
return
from
Leyden
thro
'
the
Hague
,
I
walk
as
far
as
Schevling
,
which
be
two
long
mile
,
on
purpose
to
take
a
view
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
nothing

reply
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
what
the
learn
Peireskius
do
,
who
walk
a
matter
of
five
hundred
mile
,
reckon
from
Paris
to
Schevling
,
and
from
schevle
to
Paris
back
again
,
in
order
to
see
it
,
and
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
some
man
can
not
bear
to
be
out
-
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
more
fool
Peireskius
,
reply
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
but
mark
,
'
twas
out
of
no
contempt
of
Peireskius
at
all
;
 
but
that
Peireskius
's
indefatigable
labour
in
trudge
so
far
on
foot
,
out
of
love
for
the
science
,
reduce
the
exploit
of
Dr.
Slop
,
in
that
affair
,
to
nothing
:
 
the
more
fool
Peireskius
,
say
he
again
.
 
<EOS>
why
so
?
 
<EOS>
reply
my
father
,
take
his
brother
's
part
,
not
only
to
make
reparation
as
fast
as
he
could
for
the
insult
he
have
give
him
,
which
sit
still
upon
my
father
's
mind
;
 
but
partly
,
that
my
father
begin
really
to
interest
himself
in
the
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
why
so
?
 
<EOS>
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
why
be
Peireskius
,
or
any
man
else
,
to
be
abuse
for
an
appetite
for
that
,
or
any
other
morsel
of
sound
knowledge
:
 
<EOS>
for
notwithstanding
I
know
nothing
of
the
chariot
in
question
,
continue
he
,
the
inventor
of
it
must
have
have
a
very
mechanical
head
;
and
tho
"
<EOS>
I
can
not
guess
upon
what
principle
of
philosophy
he
have
atchieve
it
;
 
yet
certainly
his
machine
have
be
construct
upon
solid
one
,
<EOS>
be
they
what
they
will
,
or
it
could
not
have
answer
at
the
rate
my
brother
mention
.
  
<EOS>
It
answer
,
reply
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
well
,
if
not
well
;
for
,
as
Peireskius
elegantly
express
it
,
speak
of
the
velocity
of
its
motion
,
Tam
citus
erat
,
quam
erat
ventus
;
which
,
unless
I
have
forget
my
Latin
,
be
,
that
it
be
as
swift
as
the
wind
itself
.
  
<EOS>

pray

Dr.
Slop
,
quoth
my
father
,
interrupt
my
uncle
(
tho
'
not
without
beg
pardon
for
it
at
the
same
time
)
upon
what
principle
be
this
self
-
same
chariot
set
a
-
going
?
 
<EOS>
upon
very
pretty
principle
to
be
sure
,
reply
Dr.
Slop
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
often
wonder
,
continue
he
,
evade
the
question
,
why
none
of
our
gentry
,
who
live
upon
large
plain
like
this
of
our
,
 
(
especially
they
whose
wife
be
not
past
child
-
bearing
)
attempt
nothing
of
this
kind
;
for
it
would
not
only
be
infinitely
expeditious
upon
sudden
call
,
to
which
the
sex
be
subject
,
 
if
the
wind
only
serve
,
 
but
would
be
excellent
good
husbandry
to
make
use
of
the
wind
,
which
cost
nothing
,
and
which
eat
nothing
,
rather
than
horse
,
which
<EOS>
(
the
devil
take
'em
)
<EOS>
both
cost
and
eat
a
great
deal
.
  
<EOS>
for
that
very
reason
,
reply
my
father
,
"
because
they
cost
nothing
,
and
because
they
eat
nothing
,
"
 
the
scheme
be
bad
;
 
it
be
the
consumption
of
our
product
,
as
well
as
the
manufacture
of
them
,
which
give
bread
to
the
hungry
,
circulate
trade
,
 
bring
in
money
,
and
support
the
value
of
our
land
;
 
and
tho
'
,
<EOS>
I
own
,
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
Prince
,
I
would
generously
recompense
the
scientifick
head
which
bring
forth
such
contrivance
;
 
yet
I
would
as
peremptorily
suppress
the
use
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
here
have
get
into
his
element
,
 
and
be
go
on
as
prosperously
with
his
dissertation
upon
trade
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
have
before
,
upon
his
of
fortification
;
 
but
to
the
loss
of
much
sound
knowledge
,
the
destiny
in
the
morning
have
decree
that
no
dissertation
of
any
kind
should
be
spin
by
my
father
that
day
,
 
for
as
he
open
his
mouth
to
begin
the
next
sentence
,
    
<EOS>
in
popped
Corporal
Trim
with
Stevinus
:
 
<EOS>
but
'
twas
too
late
,
 
all
the
discourse
have
be
exhaust
without
him
,
and
be
run
into
a
new
channel
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
take
the
book
home
again
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
nod
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
prithee
,
Corporal
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
drolle
,
 
look
first
into
it
,
and
see
if
thou
canst
spy
aught
of
a
sailing
chariot
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
corporal
Trim
,
by
be
in
the
service
,
have
learn
to
obey
,
 
and
not
to
remonstrate
,
 
so
take
the
book
to
a
side
-
table
,
and
run
over
the
leave
;
an
'
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
say
Trim
,
I
can
see
no
such
thing
;
  
however
,
continue
the
Corporal
,
drolle
a
little
in
his
turn
,
I
will
make
sure
work
of
it
,
an
'
please
your
honour
;
 
so
take
hold
of
the
two
cover
of
the
book
,
one
in
each
hand
,
and
let
the
leave
fall
down
as
he
bend
the
cover
back
,
he
give
the
book
a
good
sound
shake
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
fall
out
,
however
,
say
Trim
,
an
'
please
your
honour
;
 
but
it
be
not
a
chariot
,
or
any
thing
like
one
:
 
<EOS>
Prithee
,
Corporal
,
say
my
father
,
smiling
<EOS>
,
what
be
it
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
answer
Trim
,
stoop
to
take
it
up
,
 
'
tis
more
like
a
sermon
,
 
for
it
begin
with
a
text
of
scripture
,
and
the
chapter
and
verse
;
 
and
then
go
on
,
not
as
a
chariot
,
but
like
a
sermon
directly
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
smile
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
how
it
be
possible
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
such
a
thing
as
a
sermon
to
have
get
into
my
Stevinus
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
'
tis
a
sermon
,
replied
Trim
:
 
but
if
it
please
your
Honours
,
as
it
be
a
fair
hand
,
I
will
read
you
a
page
;
 
for
Trim
,
you
must
know
,
love
to
hear
himself
read
almost
as
well
as
talk
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
ever
a
strong
propensity
,
say
my
father
,
to
look
into
thing
which
cross
my
way
,
by
such
strange
fatality
as
these
;
 
and
as
we
have
nothing
well
to
do
,
at
least
till
Obadiah
get
back
,
I
shall
be
oblige
to
you
,
brother
,
if
Dr.
Slop
have
no
objection
to
it
,
to
order
the
Corporal
to
give
us
a
page
or
two
of
it
,
 
if
he
be
as
able
to
do
it
,
as
he
seem
willing
.
 
<EOS>
an
'
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
quoth
Trim
,
I
officiate
two
whole
campaign
,
in
flander
,
as
clerk
to
the
chaplain
of
the
regiment
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
read
it
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
well
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
,
I
assure
you
,
be
the
good
scholar
in
my
company
,
and
should
have
have
the
next
halberd
,
but
for
the
poor
fellow
's
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
lay
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
make
an
humble
bow
to
his
master
;
then
lay
down
his
hat
upon
the
floor
,
and
take
up
the
sermon
in
his
left
hand
,
in
order
to
have
his
right
at
liberty
,
 
he
advance
,
nothing
doubting
,
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
where
he
could
best
see
,
and
be
best
see
by
his
audience
.
      
<EOS>
if
you
have
any
objection
,
 
say
my
father
,
address
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
not
in
the
least
,
reply
Dr.
Slop
;
 
for
it
do
not
appear
on
which
side
of
the
question
it
be
write
,
 
it
may
be
a
composition
of
a
divine
of
our
church
,
as
well
as
yours
,
 
so
that
we
run
equal
risque
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
write
upon
neither
side
,
quoth
Trim
,
for
'
tis
only
upon
Conscience
,
an
'
please
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
's
reason
put
his
audience
into
good
humour
,
 
all
but
Dr.
Slop
,
who
turn
his
head
about
towards
Trim
,
look
a
little
angry
.
  
<EOS>
Begin
,
Trim
,
 
and
read
distinctly
,
quoth
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
reply
the
Corporal
,
make
a
bow
,
and
bespeak
attention
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
right
hand
.
      
<EOS>
but
before
the
Corporal
begin
,
I
must
first
give
you
a
description
of
his
attitude
;
 
<EOS>
otherwise
he
will
naturally
stand
represent
,
by
your
imagination
,
in
an
uneasy
posture
,
 
stiff
,
 
perpendicular
,
 
divide
the
weight
of
his
body
equally
upon
both
leg
;
 
his
eye
fix
,
as
if
on
duty
;
  
his
look
determine
,
 
clench
the
sermon
in
his
left
hand
,
like
his
firelock
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
you
would
be
apt
to
paint
Trim
,
as
if
he
be
stand
in
his
platoon
ready
for
action
,
 
<EOS>
His
attitude
be
as
unlike
all
this
as
you
can
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
He
stand
before
them
with
his
body
sway
,
and
<EOS>
bent
forwards
just
so
far
,
as
to
make
an
angle
of
85
degree
and
a
half
upon
the
plain
of
the
horizon
;
 
which
sound
orator
,
to
whom
I
address
this
,
know
very
well
to
be
the
true
persuasive
angle
of
incidence
;
 
in
any
other
angle
you
may
talk
and
preach
;
 
'
<EOS>
tis
certain
;
 
and
it
be
do
every
day
;
 
<EOS>
but
with
what
effect
,
 
I
leave
the
world
to
judge
!
  
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
this
precise
angle
of
85
degree
and
a
half
to
a
mathematical
exactness
,
 
do
it
not
shew
us
,
by
the
way
,
how
the
art
and
science
mutually
befriend
each
other
?
  
<EOS>
how
the
duce
Corporal
Trim
,
who
know
not
so
much
as
an
acute
angle
from
an
obtuse
one
,
come
to
hit
it
so
exactly
;
 
or
whether
it
be
chance
or
nature
,
or
good
sense
or
imitation
,
&
c.
shall
be
comment
upon
in
that
part
of
the
cyclopaedia
of
art
and
science
,
where
the
instrumental
part
of
the
eloquence
of
the
senate
,
the
pulpit
,
and
the
bar
,
the
coffee
-
house
,
the
bed
-
chamber
,
and
fire
-
side
,
fall
under
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
He
stand
,
 
for
I
repeat
it
,
to
take
the
picture
of
him
in
at
one
view
,
with
his
body
sway
,
and
somewhat
bent
forwards
,
 
his
right
leg
from
under
him
,
sustain
seven
-
eighth
of
his
whole
weight
,
 
the
foot
of
his
left
leg
,
the
defect
of
which
be
no
disadvantage
to
his
attitude
,
advance
a
little
,
 
not
laterally
,
nor
forwards
,
but
in
a
line
betwixt
them
;
 
his
knee
bent
,
but
that
not
violently
,
 
but
so
as
to
fall
within
the
limit
of
the
line
of
beauty
;
 
and
I
add
,
of
the
line
of
science
too
;
 
for
consider
,
it
have
one
eighth
part
of
his
body
to
bear
up
;
 
so
that
in
this
case
the
position
of
the
leg
be
determined
,
 
because
the
foot
could
be
no
farther
advanced
,
or
the
knee
more
bent
,
than
what
would
allow
him
,
mechanically
to
receive
an
eighth
part
of
his
whole
weight
under
it
,
and
to
carry
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
>
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
recommend
to
painter
;
 
need
I
add
,
 
to
orator
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
;
for
unless
they
practise
it
,
 
they
must
fall
upon
their
nose
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
for
Corporal
Trim
's
body
and
leg
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
the
sermon
loosely
,
not
carelessly
,
in
his
left
hand
,
raise
something
above
his
stomach
,
and
detach
a
little
from
his
breast
;
 
his
right
arm
fall
negligently
by
his
side
,
as
nature
and
the
law
of
gravity
order
it
,
 
but
with
the
palm
of
it
open
and
turn
towards
his
audience
,
ready
to
aid
the
sentiment
in
case
it
stand
in
need
.
  
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
's
eye
and
the
muscle
of
his
face
be
in
full
harmony
with
the
other
part
of
him
;
 
<EOS>
he
look
frank
,
 
unconstrained
,
 
something
assure
,
 
but
not
border
upon
assurance
.
  
<EOS>
let
not
the
critic
ask
how
Corporal
Trim
could
come
by
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tell
him
it
should
be
explain
;
 
but
<EOS>
so
he
stand
before
my
father
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
Dr.
Slop
,
 
so
sway
his
body
,
so
contrast
his
limb
,
and
with
such
an
oratorical
sweep
throughout
the
whole
figure
,
 
a
statuary
may
have
model
from
it
;
 
<EOS>
nay
,
I
doubt
whether
the
old
fellow
of
a
College
,
 
or
the
Hebrew
Professor
himself
,
could
have
much
mend
it
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
make
a
bow
,
and
read
as
follow
:
  
the
Sermon
.
  
<EOS>
Hebrews
xiii

18

<EOS>
Sir
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
Trim
be
certainly
in
the
right
;
for
the
writer
(
who
I
perceive
be
a
Protestant
)
by
the
snappish
manner
in
which
he
take
up
the
apostle
,
be
certainly
go
to
abuse
him
;
 
if
this
treatment
of
him
have
not
do
it
already
.
 
<EOS>
but
from
whence
,
reply
my
father
,
<EOS>
have
you
conclude
so
soon
,
Dr.
Slop
,
that
the
writer
be
of
our
church
?
 
<EOS>
for
aught
<EOS>
I
can
see
yet
,
 
he
may
be
of
any
church
.
 
<EOS>
because
,
answer
Dr.
Slop
,
if
he
be
of
our
,
 
he
durst
no
more
take
such
a
licence
,
 
than
a
bear
by
his
beard
:
  
<EOS>
if
,
in
our
communion
,
Sir

a
man
be
to
insult
an
apostle
,
 
a
saint
,
 
or
even
the
paring
of
a
saint

nail
,
 
he
would
have
his
eye
scratch
out

my

Toby

my

Prithee
spare
thy
description

<EOS>
Trim
,
I
hate
the
very
name
of
it
,
say
my
father

<EOS>
no
matter
for
that
,
answer
Dr.
Slop

it
have
its
use
;
for
tho
'
I
be
no
great
advocate
for
it
,
yet
,
in
such
a
case
as
this
,
he
would
soon
be
teach
well
manner
;
and
I
can
tell
him
,
if
he
go
on
at
that
rate
,
would
be
fling
into
the
Inquisition
for
his
pain
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
him
then
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
amen
,
add
Trim
;
for
Heaven
above
know
,
I
have
a
poor
brother
who
have
be
fourteen
year
a
captive
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
hear
one
word
of
it
before

say
my
uncle
Toby
,
hastily
:
 
<EOS>
how
come
he
there
,
Trim
?
 
<EOS>
o
,
Sir
,
the
story
will
make
your
heart
bleed
,
 
as
it
have
make
mine
a
thousand
time
;
 
but
it
be
too
long
to
be
tell
now
;
 
<EOS>
your
Honour
shall
hear
it
from
first
to
last
some
day
when
I
be
work
beside
you
in
our
fortification
;
 
but
the
short
of
the
story
be
this
;
 
that
my
brother
Tom
go
over
a
servant
to
Lisbon
,
 
and
then
marry
a
Jew
's
widow
,
who
keep
a
small
shop
,
and
sell
sausage
,
which

if
there

in

a
man
may
depend
upon
,

to
the
knowledge

which

upon

most

<EOS>
(
I
be
positive
I
be
right
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
.

<EOS>
"
if
a
man
think
at
all
,
he
can
not
well
be
a
stranger
to
the
true
state
of
this
account
:
 
<EOS>
he
must
be
privy
to
his
own
thought
and
desire
;
 
he
must
remember
his
past
pursuit
,
and
know
certainly
the
true
spring
and
motive
,
which
,
in
general
,
have
govern
the
action
of
his
life

<EOS>

I
defy
him

without

Dr.

"
in
other
matter
we
may
be
deceive
by
false
appearance

,
as
the
wise
man
complain
,
hardly
do
we
guess
aright
at
the
thing
that
be
upon

earth

with
labour
do
we
find
the
thing
that
be
before
us

here
the
mind
have
all
the
evidence

fact
within
herself

be
conscious
of
the

have
wove

its

the
exact

every
passion

work

the
several

<EOS>
(
the
language
be
good
,
and
I
declare
Trim
read
very
well
,
quoth
my
father

<EOS>
"
now
,
 
as

be
nothing
else

the
knowledge

the

have
within

of
this

the
judgment
,
either
of
approbation

censure
,
which
it
unavoidably
make
upon
the
successive
action
of
our
life

'
tis
plain
you
will
say
,
from
the
very
term
of
the
proposition
,
 
whenever
this
inward
testimony
go
against
a
man
,

he
stand
self

accuse
,
that
he
must
necessarily
be
a

,
on
the
contrary
,
when
the
report
be
favourable
on
his
side

his
heart
condemn
him
not
:
 
that
it
be
not
a
matter
of
trust
,
as
the
apostle
intimate
,
but
a
matter
of
certainty

fact

that
the
conscience
be
good
,

that
the
man
must
be
good
also

altogether
in

<EOS>
Sir
,
have
patience

reply
my
father

I
think
it
will
presently
appear

St.

be
both
of
an
opinion

my

ever
likely
to

<EOS>
go
on
,

,
quoth
my
father

)
  
<EOS>
"
at
first
sight
this
may
seem
to
be
a
true
state
of
the
case
:
 
and
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
the
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
be
so
truly
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
man
,
 
<EOS>
that
do
no
such
thing
ever
happen
,
as
that
the
conscience
of
a
man
,
by
long
habit
of
sin
,
may
(
as
the
scripture
assure
it
may
)
insensibly
become
hard
;
 
and
,
like
some
tender
part
of
his
body
,
by
much
stress
and
continual
hard
usage
,
lose
by
degree
that
nice
sense
and
perception
with
which
God
and
nature
endow
it
:
 
<EOS>
do
this
never
happen
;
 
or
be
it
certain
that
self
-
love
could
never
hang
the
least
bias
upon
the
judgment
;
 
or
that
the
little
interest
below
could
rise
up
and
perplex
the
faculty
of
our
upper
region
,
and
encompass
them
about
with
cloud
and
thick
darkness
:
 
<EOS>
Could
no
such
thing
as
favour
and
affection
enter
this
sacred
Court
 
<EOS>
do
Wit
disdain
to
take
a
bribe
in
it
;
 
or
be
ashamed
to
shew
its
face
as
an
advocate
for
an
unwarrantable
enjoyment
:
 
<EOS>
or
,
lastly
,
be
we
assure
that
interest
stand
always
unconcerned
whilst
<EOS>
the
cause
be
hear
 
and
that
passion
never
get
into
the
judgment
-
seat
,
and
pronounce
sentence
in
the
stead
of
Reason
,
which
be
suppose
always
to
preside
and
determine
upon
the
case
:
 
<EOS>
be
this
truly
so
,
as
the
objection
must
suppose
;
 
no
doubt
then
the
religious
and
moral
state
of
a
man
would
be
exactly
what
he
himself
esteem
it
:
 
and
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
every
man
's
life
could
be
know
,
in
general
,
by
no
well
measure
,
than
the
degree
of
his
own
approbation
and
censure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
,
in
one
case
,
whenever
a
man
's
conscience
do
accuse
him
(
as
it
seldom
err
on
that
side
)
<EOS>
that
he
be
guilty
;
 
and
unless
in
melancholy
and
hypocondriac
case
,
we
may
safely
pronounce
upon
it
,
that
there
be
always
sufficient
ground
for
the
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
converse
of
the
proposition
will
not
hold
true
;
 
namely
,
that
whenever
there
be
guilt
,
the
conscience
must
accuse
;
and
if
it
do
not
,
that
a
man
be
therefore
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
fact
 
so
that
the
common
consolation
which
some
good
christian
or
other
be
hourly
administer
to
himself
,
 
that
he
thank
God
<EOS>
his
mind
do
not
misgive
him
;
and
that
,
consequently
,
he
have
a
good
conscience
,
because
he
hath
a
quiet
one
,
 
be
fallacious
;
 
and
as
current
as
the
inference
be
,
and
as
infallible
as
the
rule
appear
at
first
sight
,
yet
when
you
look
near
to
it
,
and
try
the
truth
of
this
rule
upon
plain
fact
,
 
you
see
it
liable
to
so
much
error
from
a
false
application
;
 
the
principle
upon
which
it
go
so
often
pervert
;
 
the
whole
force
of
it
lose
,
and
sometimes
so
vilely
cast
away
,
that
it
be
painful
to
produce
the
common
example
from
human
life
,
which
confirm
the
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
shall
be
vicious
and
utterly
debauch
in
his
principle
;
  
exceptionable
in
his
conduct
to
the
world
;
shall
live
shameless
,
in
the
open
commission
of
a
sin
which
no
reason
or
pretence
can
justify
,
 
a
sin
by
which
,
contrary
to
all
the
working
of
humanity
,
he
shall
ruin
for
ever
the
delude
partner
of
his
guilt
;
 
rob
her
of
her
good
dowry
;
and
not
only
cover
her
own
head
with
dishonour
;
 
but
involve
a
whole
virtuous
family
in
shame
and
sorrow
for
her
sake

<EOS>
surely
,
you
will
think
conscience
must
lead
such
a
man
a
troublesome
life
;
he
can
have
no
rest
night
and
day
from
its
reproach

a
duel

to
pay
off
some
debt

aloud

<EOS>
very
right

Trim

quoth
my

<EOS>

you
do
not
consider

trim

that
the

in
Solomon

be
not
such
thing
as

bastion
,
flank
and
defend
by
other
work
;
 
this
,
Trim
,
be
an
invention
since
Solomon
's
death
;
nor
have
they
horn
-
work
,
or
ravelin
before
the
curtin
,
in
his
time

or
such
a
fosse

we
make
with
a
cuvette
in
the
middle
of

and
with
covered
way
and
counterscarps
pallisadoe
along
it

to
guard
against
a
Coup
de

so
that
the
seven
man
upon

tower
be
a
party

I
dare
say
,
from

Corps
de

set
there

not
only
to
look
out

to
defend
it

smile
inwardly

not
outwardly

subject
be
rather
too
serious
,
consider
what
have
happen

to
make
a
jest
of
.

so
put
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
,
which
he
have
just
light
,
 
he
content
himself
with
order
Trim
to
read
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
on
as
follow
:
  
"
to
have
the
fear
of
God
before
our
eye
,
and
,
in
our
mutual
dealing
with
each
other
,
to
govern
our
action
by
the
eternal
measure
of
right
and
wrong
:
 
the
first
of
these
will
comprehend
the
duty
of
religion
;
 
the
second
,
those
of
morality

which
be
so
inseparably
connect
together

that
you
can
not
divide

two

even

the
attempt
be
often
make
in

without
break

destroy
them
both

I
say
the
attempt
be
often
make
;
and
so
it
be
;
 
there
be
nothing
more
common
than
to
see
a
man
who
have
no
sense
at
all
of
religion
,
and
indeed
have
so
much
honesty
as
to
pretend
to
none
,
who
would
take
it
as
the
bitter
affront
<EOS>
,
should
you
but
hint
at
a
suspicion
of
his
moral
character
,
 
or
imagine
he
be
not
conscientiously
just
and
scrupulous
to
the
uttermost
mite
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
there
be
some
appearance
that
it
be
so
,
 
tho
"
one
be
unwilling
even
to
suspect
the
appearance
of
so
amiable
a
virtue
as
moral
honesty
,
yet
be
we
to
look
into
the
ground
of
it
,
in
the
present
case
,
I
be
persuade
we
should
find
little
reason
to
envy
such
a
one
the
honour
of
his
motive

<EOS>
"
let
him
declaim
as
pompously
as
he
choose
upon
the
subject

it
will
be
find
to
rest
upon
no
well
foundation
than
either
his
interest
,
his
pride
,
his
ease

or
some
such
little
and
changeable
passion
as
will
give
us
but
small
dependence
upon
his
action
in
matter
of
great
distress

I
will
illustrate
this
by
an
example

"
I
know
the
banker
I
deal
with
,
or
the
physician
I
usually
call
in
,
"
  
(
there
be
no
need
,
cry
Dr.
Slop
,
(
wake

to
call
in
any
physician
in
this
case

'
to
be
neither
of
them
man
of
much
religion

<EOS>
I
hear
them
make
a
jest
of
it
every
day
,
and
treat
all
its
sanction
with
so
much
scorn
,
as
to
put
the
matter
past
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
well
;
 
notwithstanding
this
,
I
put
my
fortune
into
the
hand
of
the
one
:
 
and
what
be
dearer
still
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
trust
my
life
to
the
honest
skill
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
let
me
examine
what
be
my
reason
for
this
great
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
believe
there
be
no
probability
that
either
of
them
will
employ
the
power
I
put
into
their
hand
to
my
disadvantage
;
 
<EOS>
I
consider
that
honesty
serve
the
purpose
of
this
life

<EOS>
I
know
their
success
in
the
world
depend
upon
the
fairness
of
their
character

<EOS>
in
a
word

I
be
persuade
that
they
can
not
hurt
me
without
hurt
themselves
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
put
it
otherwise
,
namely
,
that
interest
lie
,
for
once
,
on
the
other
side
;
that
a
case
should
happen
,
wherein
the
one
,
without
stain
to
his
reputation
,
could
secrete
my
fortune
,
and
leave
me
naked
in
the
world
;
 
or
that
the
other
could
send
me
out
of
it
,
and
enjoy
an
estate
by
my
death
,
without
dishonour
to
himself
or
his
art

<EOS>
in
this

what

I
of
either
of

strongly
against
me

have
I
leave
to
cast
into
the
opposite
scale

in
this

add
Dr.

a
little
piqued

our
sermon
have
greatly
the
advantage

that
we

bad
for

strongly

mind
,
that
it
be
Yorick
's
and
no
one
be
else
:
 
<EOS>
It
be
prove
to
be
so
,
a
posteriori
,
the
day
after
,
when
Yorick
send
a
servant
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
to
enquire
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
that
Yorick
,
who
be
inquisitive
after
all
kind
of
knowledge
,
have
borrow
Stevinus
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
have
carelesly
pop
his
sermon
,
as
soon
as
he
have
make
it
,
into
the
middle
of
Stevinus
;
and
by
an
act
of
forgetfulness
,
to
which
he
be
ever
subject
,
he
have
send
Stevinus
home
,
and
his
sermon
to
keep
him
company
.
  
<EOS>
Ill

fate
sermon
!
 
<EOS>
Thou
wast
lose
,
after
this
recovery
of
thee
,
a
second
time
,
drop
thru
'
an
unsuspected
fissure
in
thy
master
's
pocket
,
down
into
a
treacherous
and
a
tattere
lining
,
 
trod
deep
into
the
dirt
by
the
left
hind
-
foot
of
his
Rosinante
inhumanly
step
upon
thee
as
thou
falledst
;
 
bury
ten
day
in
the
mire
,
 
raise
up
out
of
it
by
a
beggar
,
  
sell
for
a
halfpenny
to
a
parish
-
clerk
,
 
transfer
to
his
parson
,
 
lose
for
ever
to
thy
own
,
the
remainder
of
his
day
,
 
nor
restore
to
his
restless
Manes
till
this
very
moment
,
that
I
tell
the
world
the
story
.
  
<EOS>
Can
the
reader
believe
,
that
this
sermon
of
Yorick
's
be
preach
at
an
assize
,
in
the
cathedral
of
York
,
before
a
thousand
witness
,
ready
to
give
oath
of
it
,
by
a
certain
prebendary
of
that
church
,
and
actually
print
by
him
when
he
have
do
,
 
and
within
so
short
a
space
as
two
year
and
three
month
after
Yorick
's
death
?
 
<EOS>
Yorick
indeed
,
be
never
better
serve
in
his
life
;
 
but
it
be
a
little
hard
to
maltreat
him
after
,
and
plunder
him
after
he
be
lay
in
his
grave
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
gentleman
who
do
it
be
in
perfect
charity
with
Yorick
,
  
and
,
in
conscious
justice
,
print
but
a
few
copy
to
give
away
;
 
and
that
I
be
tell
he
could
moreover
have
make
as
good
a
one
himself
,
have
he
think
fit
,
 
I
declare
I
would
not
have
publish
this
anecdote
to
the
world
;
 
nor
do
I
publish
it
with
an
intent
to
hurt
his
character
and
advancement
in
the
church
;
 
<EOS>
I
leave
that
to
other
;
 
but
I
find
myself
impel
by
two
reason
,
which
I
can
not
withstand
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
that
in
do
justice
,
I
may
give
rest
to
Yorick
's
ghost
;
  
which
 
as
the
country
-
people
,
and
some
other
believe
,
 
still
walk
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
reason
be
,
that
,
by
lay
open
this
story
to
the
world
,
I
gain
an
opportunity
of
inform
it
,
 
that
in
case
the
character
of
parson
Yorick
,
and
this
sample
of
his
sermon
,
be
like
,
 
there
be
now
in
the
possession
of
the
Shandy
family
,
as
many
as
will
make
a
handsome
volume
,
at
the
world
's
service
,
 
and
much
good
<EOS>
may
they
do
it
.
    
<EOS>
Obadiah
gain
the
two
crown
without
dispute
;
 
for
he
come
in
jingling
,
with
all
the
instrument
in
the
green
baize
bag
we
speak
of
,
fling
across
his
body
,
just
as
Corporal
Trim
go
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
proper
,
I
think
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
(
clear
up
his
look
)
as
we
be
in
a
condition
to
be
of
some
service
to
Mrs.
Shandy
,
to
send
up
stair
to
know
how
she
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
order
,
answer
my
father
,
the
old
midwife
to
come
down
to
us
upon
the
least
difficulty
;
 
<EOS>
for
you
must
know
,
Dr.
Slop
,
continue
my
father
,
with
a
perplex
kind
of
a
smile
upon
his
countenance
,
that
by
express
treaty
,
solemnly
ratify
between
me
and
my
wife
,
you
be
no
more
than
an
auxiliary
in
this
affair
,
 
and
not
so
much
as
that
,
 
unless
the
lean
old
mother
of
a
midwife
above
stair
can
not
do
without
you
.
 
<EOS>
woman
have
their
particular
fancy
,
and
in
point
of
this
nature
,
continue
my
father
,
where
they
bear
the
whole
burden
,
and
suffer
so
much
acute
pain
for
the
advantage
of
our
family
,
and
the
good
of
the
specie
,
 
they
claim
a
right
of
deciding
,
en
Souveraines
,
in
whose
hand
,
and
in
what
fashion
,
they
choose
to
undergo
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
in
the
right
of
it
,
 
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
but
Sir
,
reply
Dr.
Slop
,
not
take
notice
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
opinion
,
but
turn
to
my
father
,
 
they
have
well
govern
in
other
point
;
 
and
a
father
of
a
family
,
who
wish
its
perpetuity
,
in
my
opinion
,
have
well
exchange
this
prerogative
with
them
,
and
give
up
some
other
right
in
lieu
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
answer
a
letter
too
testily
,
to
be
quite
dispassionate
in
what
he
say
,
 
I
know
not
,
quoth
<EOS>
he
,
what
we
have
leave
to
give
up
,
in
lieu
of
who
shall
bring
our
child
into
the
world
,
unless
that
,
 
of
who
shall
beget
them
.
 
<EOS>
one
would
almost
give
up
any
thing
,
reply
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
 
answer
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
reply
Dr.
Slop
,
it
would
astonish
you
to
know
what
improvement
we
have
make
of
late
year
in
all
branch
of
obstetrical
knowledge
,
but
particularly
in
that
one
single
point
of
the
safe
and
expeditious
extraction
of
the
foetus
,
 
which
have
receive
such
light
,
that
,
for
my
part
(
hold
up
his
hand
)
<EOS>
I
declare
I
wonder
how
the
world
have
 
I
wish
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
you
have
see
what
prodigious
army
we
have
in
Flanders
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
drop
the
curtain
over
this
scene
for
a
minute
,
 
to
remind
you
of
one
thing
,
 
and
to
inform
you
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
inform
you
,
come
,
I
own
,
a
little
out
of
its
due
course
;
  
for
it
should
have
be
tell
a
hundred
and
fifty
page
ago
,
but
<EOS>
that
I
foresaw
then
"
twould
come
in
pat
hereafter
,
and
be
of
more
advantage
here
than
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
writer
have
need
look
before
them
,
to
keep
up
the
spirit
and
connection
of
what
they
have
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
when
these
two
thing
be
do
,
 
the
curtain
shall
be
draw
up
again
,
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
my
father
,
and
Dr.
Slop
,
shall
go
on
with
their
discourse
,
without
any
more
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
the
matter
which
I
have
to
remind
you
of
,
be
this
;
 
that
from
the
specimen
of
singularity
in
my
father
's
notion
in
the
point
of
Christian
-
name
,
and
that
other
previous
point
thereto
,
 
you
be
lead
,
I
think
,
into
an
opinion
,
 
(
and
I
be
sure
I
say
as
much
)
that
my
father
be
a
gentleman
altogether
as
odd
and
whimsical
in
fifty
other
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
in
truth
,
there
be
not
a
stage
in
the
life
of
man
,
from
the
very
first
act
of
his
begetting
,
 
down
to
the
lean
and
slippered
pantaloon
in
his
second
childishness
,
but
he
have
some
favourite
notion
to
himself
,
spring
out
of
it
,
as
sceptical
,
and
as
far
out
of
the
high
-
way
of
thinking
,
as
these
two
which
have
be
explain
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Shandy
,
my
father
,
Sir
,
would
see
nothing
in
the
light
in
which
other
place
it
;
 
he
place
thing
in
his
own
light
;
 
he
would
weigh
nothing
in
common
scale
;
 
no
,
he
be
too
refine
a
researcher
to
lie
open
to
so
gross
an
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
to
come
at
the
exact
weight
of
thing
in
the
scientific
steel
-
yard
,
the
fulcrum
,
he
would
say
,
should
be
almost
invisible
,
to
avoid
all
friction
from
popular
tenet
;
 
without
this
the
minutia
of
philosophy
,
which
would
always
turn
the
balance
,
will
have
no
weight
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
knowledge
,
like
matter
,
he
would
affirm
,
be
divisible
in
infinitum
;
 
that
the
grain
and
scruple
be
as
much
a
part
of
it
,
as
the
gravitation
of
the
whole
world
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
would
say
,
error
be
error
,
 
no
matter
where
it
fall
,
 
whether
in
a
fraction
,
 
or
a
pound
,
 
'
twas
alike
fatal
to
truth
,
and
she
be
keep
down
at
the
bottom
of
her
well
,
as
inevitably
by
a
mistake
in
the
dust
of
a
butterfly
's
wing
,
 
as
in
the
disk
of
the
sun
,
the
moon
,
and
all
the
star
of
heaven
put
together
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
often
lament
that
it
be
for
want
of
consider
this
properly
,
and
of
apply
it
skilfully
to
civil
matter
,
as
well
as
to
speculative
truth
,
that
so
many
thing
in
this
world
be
out
of
joint
;
 
that
the
political
arch
be
give
way
;
 
and
that
the
very
foundation
of
our
excellent
constitution
in
church
and
state
,
be
so
sap
as
estimator
have
report
.
  
<EOS>
You
cry
out
,
he
would
say
,
we
be
a
ruin
,
undone
people
.
 
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
he
would
ask
,
make
use
of
the
sorite
or
syllogism
of
Zeno
and
Chrysippus
,
without
know
it
belong
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
why
be
we
a
ruin
people
?
 
<EOS>
because
we
be
corrupt
.
 
<EOS>
Whence
be
it
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
that
we
be
corrupt
?
 
<EOS>
because
we
be
needy
;
 
our
poverty
,
and
not
our
will
,
consent
.
 
<EOS>
and
wherefore
,
he
would
add
,
be
we
needy
?
 
<EOS>
from
the
neglect
,
he
would
answer
,
of
our
penny
and
our
halfpence
:
 
<EOS>
Our
bank
note
,
Sir
,
our
guinea
,
 
nay
our
shilling
take
care
of
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
<EOS>
the
same
,
he
would
say
,
throughout
the
whole
circle
of
the
science
;
  
the
great
,
the
establish
point
of
them
,
be
not
to
be
break
in
upon
.
  
<EOS>
the
law
of
nature
will
defend
themselves
;
 
but
error
 
<EOS>
(
he
would
add
,
look
earnestly
at
my
mother
)
 
error
,
Sir
,
creep
in
thro
"
the
minute
hole
and
small
crevice
which
human
nature
leave
unguarded
.
  
<EOS>
this
turn
of
thinking
in
my
father
,
be
what
I
have
to
remind
you
of
:
 
<EOS>
the
point
you
be
to
be
inform
of
,
and
which
I
have
reserve
for
this
place
,
be
as
follow
.
  
<EOS>
amongst
the
many
and
excellent
reason
,
with
which
my
father
have
urge
my
mother
to
accept
of
Dr.
Slop
's
assistance
preferably
to
that
of
the
old
woman
,
 
there
be
one
of
a
very
singular
nature
;
which
,
when
he
have
do
argue
the
matter
with
her
as
a
Christian
,
and
come
to
argue
it
over
again
with
her
as
a
philosopher
,
he
have
put
his
whole
strength
to
,
depend
indeed
upon
it
as
his
sheet
-
anchor
.
 
<EOS>
It
fail
him
,
tho
'
from
no
defect
in
the
argument
itself
;
but
that
,
do
what
he
could
,
he
be
not
able
for
his
soul
to
make
her
comprehend
the
drift
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
curse
luck
!
 
<EOS>
say
he
to
himself
,
one
afternoon
,
as
he
walk
out
of
the
room
,
after
he
have
be
state
it
for
an
hour
and
a
half
to
her
,
to
no
manner
of
purpose
;
 
curse
luck
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
bite
his
lip
as
he
shut
the
door
,
 
for
a
man
to
be
master
of
one
of
the
fine
chain
of
reasoning
in
nature
,
 
and
have
a
wife
at
the
same
time
with
such
a
head
-
piece
,
that
he
can
not
hang
up
a
single
inference
within
side
of
it
,
to
save
his
soul
from
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
this
argument
,
though
it
be
entirely
lose
upon
my
mother
,
 
have
more
weight
with
him
,
than
all
his
other
argument
join
together
:
 
I
will
therefore
endeavour
to
do
it
justice
,
 
and
set
it
forth
with
all
the
perspicuity
I
be
master
of
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
set
out
upon
the
strength
of
these
two
follow
axiom
:
  
<EOS>
first
,
that
an
ounce
of
a
man
's
own
wit
,
be
worth
a
ton
of
other
people
's
;
and
,
  
secondly
,
(
which
by
the
bye
,
be
the
ground
-
work
of
the
first
axiom
,
 
tho
'
<EOS>
it
come
last
)
that
every
man
's
wit
must
come
from
every
man
's
own
soul
,
  
and
no
other
body
's
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
as
it
be
plain
to
my
father
,
that
all
soul
be
by
nature
equal
,
  
and
that
the
great
difference
between
the
most
acute
and
the
most
obtuse
understanding
 
be
from
no
original
sharpness
or
bluntness
of
one
thinking
substance
above
or
below
another
,
 
but
arise
merely
from
the
lucky
or
unlucky
organization
of
the
body
,
in
that
part
where
the
soul
principally
take
up
her
residence
,
 
he
have
make
it
the
subject
of
his
enquiry
to
find
out
the
identical
place
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
from
the
good
account
he
have
be
able
to
get
of
this
matter
,
he
be
satisfied
it
could
not
be
where
Des
Cartes
have
fix
it
,
upon
the
top
of
the
pineal
gland
of
the
brain
;
which
,
as
he
philosophize
,
form
a
cushion
for
her
about
the
size
of
a
marrow
pea
;
tho
'
to
speak
the
truth
,
as
so
many
nerve
do
terminate
all
in
that
one
place
,
 
'
twas
no
bad
conjecture
;
 
and
my
father
have
certainly
fall
with
that
great
philosopher
plumb
into
the
centre
of
the
mistake
,
have
it
not
be
for
my
uncle
Toby
,
who
rescue
him
out
of
it
,
by
a
story
he
tell
him
of
a
Walloon
officer
at
the
battle
of
Landen
,
who
have
one
part
of
his
brain
shoot
away
by
a
musket
-
ball
,
 
and

by
a

surgeon

and
after
all
,
recover
,
and
do
his
duty
very
well
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
if
death
,
say
my
father
,
reason
with
himself
,
be
nothing
but
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body

if
it
be
true
that
people
can
walk

Q.E.D.
  
<EOS>
as
for
that
certain
,
very
thin
,
subtle
and
very
fragrant
juice
which
Coglionissimo
Borri
,
the
great
Milaneze
physician
affirm
,
in
a
letter
to
Bartholine
,
to
have
discover
in
the
cellulae
of
the
occipital
part
of
the
cerebellum
,
and
which
he
likewise
affirm
to
be
the
principal
seat
of
the
reasonable
soul
,
(
for
,
you
must
know
,
in
these
latter
and
more
enlightened
age
,
there
be
two
soul
in
every
man
live
,
 
the
one
,
accord
to
the
great
Metheglingius
,
be
call
the
Animus
,
the
other
,
the
Anima
;
)
 
as
for
the
opinion
<EOS>
,
I
say
of
Borri
,
 
my
father
could
never
subscribe
to
it
by
any
mean
;
<EOS>
the
very
idea
of
so
noble
,
so
refined
,
so
immaterial
,
and
so
exalted
a
being
as
the
Anima
,
or
even
the
Animus
,
take
up
her
residence
,
and
sit
dabbling
,
like
a
tad
-
pole
all
day
long
,
both
summer
and
winter
,
in
a
puddle
,
 
or
in
a
liquid
of
any
kind
,
how
thick
or
thin
soever
,
he
would
say
,
shock
his
imagination
;
he
would
scarce
give
the
doctrine
a
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
what
,
therefore
,
seem
the
least
liable
to
objection
of
any
,
be
that
the
chief
sensorium
,
or
head
-
quarter
of
the
soul
,
and
to
which
place
all
intelligence
be
refer
,
and
from
whence
all
her
mandate
be
issue
,
 
be
in
,
or
near
,
the
cerebellum
,
 
or
rather
somewhere
about
the
medulla
oblongata
<EOS>
,
wherein
it
be
generally
agree
by
dutch
anatomist
,
that
all
the
minute
nerve
from
all
the
organ
of
the
seven
sense
concenter
,
like
street
and
wind
alley
,
into
a
square
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
there
be
nothing
singular
in
my
father
's
opinion
,
 
<EOS>
he
have
the
good
of
philosopher
,
of
all
age
and
climate
,
to
go
along
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
he
take
a
road
of
his
own
,
set
up
another
shandean
hypothesis
upon
these
corner
-
stone
they
have
lay
for
him
;
 
and
which
say
hypothesis
equally
stand
its
ground
;
whether
the
subtilty
and
fineness
of
the
soul
depend
upon
the
temperature
and
clearness
of
the
say
liquor
,
or
of
the
fine
net
-
work
and
texture
in
the
cerebellum
itself
;
which
opinion
he
favour
.
  
<EOS>
He
maintain
,
that
next
to
the
due
care
to
be
take
in
the
act
of
propagation
of
each
individual
,
which
require
all
the
thought
in
the
world
,
as
it
lay
the
foundation
of
this
incomprehensible
contexture
,
in
which
wit
,
memory
,
fancy
,
eloquence
,
and
what
be
usually
mean
by
the
name
of
good
natural
part
,
do
consist
;
 
that
next
to
this
and
his
Christian-
name
,
which
be
the
two
original
and
most
efficacious
cause
of
all
;
 
that
the
third
cause
,
or
<EOS>
rather
what
logician
call
the
Causa
sina
qua
non

and
without
which
all
that
be
do
be
of
no

the

how

no

the

It
be
the

have
conceive

this

when

nature

lay
a

their

no

that

He
mention
the

this

that
my

for
happen

a

therefore
one

great

of

Dr.

he

he

scatter

these

My

Dr.

a
disservice
which
his

never
intend

<EOS>
Sir

it
confound
him

thereby
put
his

first
into
confusion

then
to

he
could
not
rally

again
for
the

<EOS>
in

whether
for
honour

for

it
make
no

nothing
be
more
dangerous
,
<EOS>
Madam

than
a
wish
come
sideways
in
this
unexpected
manner
upon
a
man
:
 
the
safe
way
in
general
to
take
off
the
force
of

be
for
the
party
<EOS>
wish'd
at
,
instantly
to
get
upon
his
leg
 
and
wish
the
wisher
something
in
return
,
of
pretty
near
the

value
,
 
so
balance
the
account
upon
the
spot
,
you
stand
as
you
be
 
<EOS>
nay
sometimes
gain
the
advantage
of
the
attack
by
it

<EOS>
this
will
be
fully
illustrate
to
the
world
in
my
chapter
of
wish
.
    
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
do
not
understand
the
nature
of
this
defence
;
 
he
be
puzzle
with
it
,
and
it
put
an
entire
stop
to
the
dispute
for
four
minute
and
a
half
;
 
five
have
be
fatal
to
it
:
 
<EOS>
my
father
see
the
danger
 
<EOS>
the
dispute
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
dispute
in
the
world
,
"
whether
the
child
of
his
prayer
and
endeavour
should
be
bear
without
a
head

he
wait

to
allow
Dr.
Slop
,
in
whose
behalf
the
wish
be
make

his
right
of
return
it

but
perceive
,
I
say
,
that
he
be
confound
,
and
continue
look
with
that
perplex
vacuity
of

which
puzzle

generally
stare

along

of

till
he
have
get

the
opposite
point
of
the
compass
,
 
and
that
he
have
actually
begin
to
count
the
brass
nail
upon
the
arm
of
his

,
 
my
father
think
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
so
take
up
the
discourse
as

<EOS>
"
 
what
prodigious
army
you
have

"
    
<EOS>
Brother
Toby
,
reply
my
father
,
take
his
wig
from
off
his
head
with
his
right
hand
,
and
with
his
left
pull
out
a
stripe
India
handkerchief
from
his
right
coat
pocket
,
in
order
to
rub
his
head
,
as
he
argue
the
point
with
my
uncle
Toby
.
      
<EOS>
now
,
in
this
I
think
my
father
be
much
to
blame
;
and
I
will
give
you
my
reason
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
matter
of
no
more
seeming
consequence
in
themselves
than
,
"
whether
my
father
should
have
take
off
his
wig
with
his
right
hand
or
with
his
left
,
"
 
have
divide
the
great
kingdom
,
and
make
the
crown
of
the
monarchs
who
govern
them
,
to
totter
upon
their
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
need
I
tell
you
,
Sir
,
that
the
circumstance
with
which
every
thing
in
this
world
be
begirt
,
give
every
thing
in
this
world
its
size
and
shape
!
 
<EOS>
and
by
tighten
it
,
or
relax
it
,
this
way
or
that
,
make
the
thing
to
be
,
what
it
be
 
great
 
<EOS>
little
 
good
 
<EOS>
bad
 
indifferent
or
not
indifferent
,
just
as
the
case
happen
?
  
<EOS>
as
my
father
's
India
handkerchief
be
in
his
right
coat
pocket
,
he
should
by
no
mean
have
suffer
his
right
hand
to
have
get
engage
:
 
on
the
contrary
,
instead
of
take
off
his
wig
with
it
,
as
he
do
,
he
ought
to
have
commit
that
entirely
to
the
left
;
and
then
,
when
the
natural
exigency
my
father
be
under
of
rub
his
head
,
call
out
for
his
handkerchief
,
he
would
have
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
have
do
,
but
to
have
put
his
right
hand
into
his
right
coat
pocket
and
take
it
out
;
 
which
he
may
have
do
without
any
violence
,
or
the
least
ungraceful
twist
in
any
one
tendon
or
muscle
of
his
whole
body
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
case
,
(
unless
,
indeed
,
my
father
have
be
resolve
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
by
hold
the
wig
stiff
in
his
left
hand
 
or
by
make
some
nonsensical
angle
or
other
at
his
elbow
-
joint
,
or
armpit
)
 
<EOS>
his
whole
attitude
have
be
easy
 
natural
 
unforce
:
 
Reynolds
himself
,
as
great
and
gracefully
as
he
paint
,
may
have
paint
him
as
he
sit
.
  
<EOS>
now
as
my
father
manage
this
matter
,
 
consider
what
a
devil
of
a
figure
my
father
make
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
latter
end
of
Queen
Anne
's
reign
,
and
in
the
beginning
of

reign
of
King
George

<EOS>
I
need
say
no
more
 
<EOS>
the

of

,
have
he
be
hammer
at
it
a
month
,
could
not
have
contrive
a
bad
fashion
for
one
in
my
father
's
situation
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
an
easy
matter
in
any
king
's
reign
(
unless
you
be
as
lean
a
subject
as
myself
)
to
have
force
your
hand
diagonally
,
quite
across
your
whole
body
,
so
as
to
gain
the
bottom
of
your
opposite
coat
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighteen
,
when
this
happen
,
it
be
extremely
difficult
;
so
that
when
my
uncle
Toby
discover
the
transverse
zig
-
zaggery
of
my
father
's
approach
towards
it
,
it
instantly
bring
into
his
mind
those
he
have
do
duty
in
,
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
;
 
the
idea
of
which
draw
off
his
attention
so
intirely
from
the
subject
in
debate
,
that
he
have
get
his
right
hand
to
the
bell
to
ring
up
trim
to
go
and
fetch
his
map
of
Namur
,
and
his
compass
and
sector
along
with
it
,
to
measure
the
return
angle
of
the
traverse
of
that
attack
,
 
but
particularly
of
that
one
,
where
he
receive
his
wound
upon
his
groin
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
knit
his
brow
,
and
as
he
knit
them
,
all
the
blood
in
his
body
seem
to
rush
up
into
his

my

Toby
dismount
immediately

there
be

without

him
on

it

<EOS>
however
,
as
this
,
in
some
measure
,
unguarde
the
mouth
of
the
bag
,
lest
any
thing
should
bolt
out
in
gallop
back
,
at
the
speed
Obadiah
threaten
,
they
consult
to
take
it
off
again
:
 
and
in
the
great
care
and
caution
of
their
heart
,
they
have
take
the
two
string
and
tie
them
close
(
purse
up
the
mouth
of
the
bag
first
)
with
half
a
dozen
hard
knot
,
each
of
which
Obadiah
,
to
make
all
safe
,
have
twitch
and
draw
together
with
all
the
strength
of
his
body
.
  
<EOS>
this
answer
all
that
Obadiah
and
the
maid
intend
;
but
be
no
remedy
against
some
evil
which
neither
he
or
she
foresee
.
 
<EOS>
the
instrument
,
it
seem
,
as
tight
as
the
bag
be
tie
above
,
have
so
much
room
to
play
in
it
,
towards
the
bottom
(
the
shape
of
the
bag
be
conical
)
that
Obadiah
could
not
make
a
trot
of
it
,
but
with
such
a
terrible
jingle
,
what
with
the
tire
tete
,
forceps
,
and
squirt
,
as
would
have
be
enough
,
have
Hymen
be
take
a
jaunt
that
way
,
to
have
frighten
him
out
of
the
country
;
but
when
Obadiah
accelerate
his
motion
,
and
from
a
plain
trot
assay
to
prick
his
coach
-
horse
into
a
full
gallop
 
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
the
jingle
be
incredible
.
  
<EOS>
as
Obadiah
have
a
wife
and
three
child
 
the
turpitude
of
fornication
,
and
the
many
other
political
ill
consequence
of
this
jingling
,
never
once
enter
his
brain
,
 
he
have
however
his
objection
,
which
come
home
to
himself
,
and
weigh
with
him
,
as
it
have
oft
-
time
do
with
the
great
patriot
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
poor
fellow
,
Sir
,
be
not
able
to
hear
himself
whistle
.
"
    
<EOS>
as
Obadiah
love
wind
-
music
preferably
to
all
the
instrumental
music
he
carry
with
him
,
 
he
very
considerately
set
his
imagination
to
work
,
to
contrive
and
to
invent
by
what
mean
he
should
put
himself
in
a
condition
of
enjoy
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
distress
(
except
musical
)
where
small
cord
be
want
,
nothing
be
so
apt
to
enter
a
man
's
head
as
his
hat
-
band
:
 
<EOS>
the
philosophy
of
this
be
so
near
the
surface
 
<EOS>
I
scorn
to
enter
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
Obadiah
's
be
a
mixed
case
 
mark
,
Sirs
,
 
I
say
,
a
mixed
case
;
for
it
be
obstetrical
,
 
scrip
-
tical
,
squirtical
,
papistical
 
and
as
far
as
the
coach-
horse
be
concern
in
it
,
 
caballistical
 
and
only
partly
musical
;
  
Obadiah
make
no
scruple
of
avail
himself
of
the
first
expedient
which
offer
;
so
take
hold
of
the
bag
and
instrument
,
and
gripe
them
hard
together
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
finger
and
thumb
of
the
other
put
the
end
of
the
hat
-
band
betwixt
his
tooth
,
and
then
slip
his
hand
down
to
the
middle
of
it
,
 
he
tie
and
cross
-
tie
them
all
fast
together
from
one
end
to
the
other
(
as
you
would
cord
a
trunk
)
<EOS>
with
such
a
multiplicity
of
round
-
about
and
intricate
cross
turn
,
with
a
hard
knot
at
every
intersection
or
point
where
the
string
meet
,
 
that
Dr.
Slop
must
have
have
three
fifth
of
Job
's
patience
at
least
to
have
unloose
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
in
my
conscience
,
that
have
nature
be
in
one
of
her
nimble
mood
,
and
in
humour
for
such
a
contest
 
and
she
and
Dr.
Slop
both
fairly
start
together
 
there
be
no
man
live
which
have
see
the
bag
with
all
that
Obadiah
have
do
to
it
,
 
and
know
likewise
the
great
speed
the
Goddess
can
make
when
she
think
proper
,
who
would
have
have
the
least
doubt
remain
in
his
mind
 
which
of
the
two
would
have
carry
off
the
prize
.
 
<EOS>
My

Great
wit
jump
:
for
the
moment
Dr.
Slop
cast
his
eye
upon
his
bag
(
which
he
have
not
do
till
the
dispute
with
my
uncle
Toby
about
mid
-
wifery
put
him
in
mind
of
it
)
 
<EOS>
the
very
same
thought
occur

<EOS>
'
Tis
God
's
mercy
,
quoth
<EOS>
he
(
to
himself
)
that
Mrs.

have
have
so
bad
a
time
of
it
,
 
else
<EOS>
she
may

be
bring

seven

tell
,
before
one
half
of

knot
could
have
get
untie

<EOS>
but
here
you
must
distinguish
 
the
thought
float
only
in
Dr.
Slop
's
mind
,
without
sail
or
ballast
to
it
,
as
a
simple
proposition
;
million
of
which
,
as
your
worship
know
,
be
every

swim
quietly
in
the
middle
of
the
thin
juice
of
a

's
understanding
,
without
be
carry
backwards
or
forwards
,
till
some
little
gust
of
passion
or
interest
drive
them
to
one
side
.
  
<EOS>
a
sudden
trampling
in
the

near

,
do
the
proposition
<EOS>
the
very
service
I
be
speak
of
.
 
<EOS>
by
all
that
be
unfortunate
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
unless
I
make
haste
,
the
thing
will
actually
befall
me
as
it
be
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
knot
,
 
by
which
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
would
not
be
understand
to
mean
slip
-
knot
 
because
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
opinion
 
my
opinion
concern
them
will
come
in
more
properly
when
I
mention
the
catastrophe
of
my
great
uncle
<EOS>
Mr.
Hammond
Shandy
,
 
a
little
man
,
 
but
of
high
fancy
:
 
<EOS>
he
rush
into
the
duke
of
Monmouth
's
affair
:
  
nor
,
secondly
,
in
this
place
,
do
I
mean
that
particular
specie
of
knot
call
bow
-
knot
;
 
there
be
so
little
address
,
or
skill
,
or
patience
require
in
the
unloose
them

that
they
be

by

may

I

good

in

there
be

believe

the

My

could
not

to
hear
him
disposed

in
such
a
manner
 
<EOS>
he
have
moreover
some
little

be
determined

<EOS>
small
curse
<EOS>
,
Dr.
Slop
,
upon
great
occasion
,
quoth
my
father
(
condole
with
him
first
upon
the
accident
)
be
but
so
much
waste
of
our
strength
and
soul
's
health
to
no
manner
of
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
it
,
reply
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
like
sparrow

quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
(
suspend

fire
against
a
bastion
.
 
<EOS>
They
serve
,
continue
my
father
,
to
stir
the
humour
  
but
carry
off
none
of
their
acrimony
:
 
for
my
own
part
,
I
seldom
swear
or
curse
at
all
 
<EOS>
I
hold
it
bad
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
fall
into
it
by
surprize
,
I
generally
retain
so
much
presence
of
mind
(
<EOS>
right
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
)
<EOS>
as
to
make
it
answer
my
purpose
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
I
swear
on
till
I
find
myself
easy
.
 
<EOS>
a

a

always
endeavour
to
proportion
the
vent
give
to
these
humour
,
not
only
to
the

stir
within

ill
intent
of
the
offence
upon
which
they
be
to
fall
.
  
<EOS>
"
injury
come
only
from
the

"
 
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
continue
my
father
,
with
the
most
Cervantick
gravity
,
I
have
the
great
veneration
in
the
world
for
that
gentleman
,
who
,
in
distrust
of
his
own
discretion
in
this
point
,
sit
down
and
compose
(
that
be
at
his
leisure
)
fit
form
of
swear
suitable
to
all
case
,
from
the
low
to
the
high
provocation
which
could
possibly
happen
to
him
 
which
form
be
well
consider
by
him
,
and
such
moreover
as
he
could
stand
to
,
he
keep
them
ever
by
him
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
within
his
reach
,
ready
for
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
apprehend
,
reply
Dr.
Slop
,
that
such
a
thing
be
ever
think
of
 
much
less
executed
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon

answer
my

I
be

not

one
of

if
I
remember
right

'

<EOS>
not

<EOS>
the

take

<EOS>
then
,
answer
my

,
'
Tis
much
at

Dr.

on

rise
up

reach
down
a

<EOS>
he

Dr.

to
swear
them
,
 
<EOS>
imagine
that
we
have
have
the
wit
to
invent
them
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
undertake
this
moment
to
prove
it
to
any
man
in
the
world
,
except
to
a
connoisseur
:
 
though
I
declare
I
object
only
to
a
connoisseur
in
swear
,
 
as
I
would
do
to
a
connoisseur
in
painting
,
&
c.
&
c.
<EOS>
the
whole
set
of
'em
be
so
hung
round
and
<EOS>
befetish'd
with
the
bobs
and
trinket
of
criticism
,
  
or
to
drop
my
metaphor
,
which
by
the
bye
be
a
pity
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
<EOS>
fetch'd
<EOS>
it
as
far
as
from
the
coast
of
Guiney
;
 
their
head
,
Sir
,
be
stick
so
full
of
rule
and
compass
,
and
have
that
eternal
propensity
to
apply
them
upon
all
occasion
,
that
a
work
of
genius
have
better
go
to
the
devil
at
once
,
than
stand
to
be
prick'd
and
torture
to
death
by
'em
.
    
<EOS>
and
how
do
Garrick
speak
the
soliloquy
last
night
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
against
all
rule
,
my
lord
,
 
most
ungrammatically
!
<EOS>
betwixt
the
substantive
and
the
adjective
,
which
should
agree
together
in
number
,
case
,
and
gender
<EOS>
,
he
make
a
breach
thus
,
 
stop
,
as
if
the
point
want
settle
;
 
and
betwixt
the
nominative
case
,
which
your
lordship
know
should
govern
the
verb
,
he
suspend
his
voice
in
the
epilogue
a
dozen
time
three
second
and
three
fifth
by
a
stop
watch
,
my
lord
,
each
time

<EOS>
admirable
grammarian
!
 
<EOS>
but
in
suspend
his
voice
 
be
the
sense
suspend
likewise
?
 
<EOS>
do
no
expression
of
attitude
or
countenance
fill
up
the
chasm

<EOS>
be
the
eye
silent

<EOS>
do
you
narrowly
look

<EOS>
I
look'd
<EOS>
only
at
the
stop

watch
,
my
lord

<EOS>
excellent
observer
!
  
<EOS>
and
what
of
this
new

the
whole

make
such
a
rout
about
?
 
<EOS>
oh
!
'
<EOS>
tis
out
of
all
plumb
,
my

quite
an
irregular

!
 
<EOS>
not

I

<EOS>
excellent

<EOS>
and
for
the

your

bid
me
look
at
 
upon
take
the
length
,
breadth
,
height

and
depth
of
it

and
try
them
at

in

<EOS>
admirable
connoisseur

<EOS>
and
do
you
step
in
,
to
take
a
look
at
the
grand
picture
in
your
way
back
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
melancholy
daub
!
<EOS>
my
lord
;
not
one
principle
of
the
pyramid
in
any
one
group
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
a
price
!
 
<EOS>
for
there
be
nothing
of
the
colouring
of
Titian
 
the
expression
of
Rubens
 
the
grace
of
Raphael
 
<EOS>
the
purity
of
Dominichino
 
the
corregiescity
of
Corregio
 
the
learning
of
Poussin
 
<EOS>
the
air
of
Guido
 
<EOS>
the
taste
of
the
Carrachis
 
or
the
grand
contour
of
Angelo
.
 
<EOS>
grant
me
patience
,
just
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
of
all
the
cant
which
be
cant
in
this
canting
world
 
though
the
can
not
of
hypocrite
may
be
the
bad
 
<EOS>
the
can
not
of
criticism
be
the
most
tormenting
!
  
<EOS>
I
would
go
fifty
mile
on
foot
,
for
I
have
not
a
horse
worth
ride
on

to
kiss
the
hand
of
that

whose
generous

will
give
up
the
rein
of

into
his

<EOS>
be

<EOS>
Great
Apollo

<EOS>
if
thou
art
in

give
me
 
<EOS>
I
ask
no
more
,
but
one
stroke
of
native
humour
,
with
a
single
spark
of
thy

along
with
it

send
Mercury

if
he

,
with
my
compliment
to
 
no
matter
.
  
<EOS>
now
to
any
one
else
I
will
undertake
to
prove
,
that
all
the
oath
and
imprecation
which
we
have
be
puff
off
upon
the
world
for
these
two
hundred
and
fifty
year
last
past
as
original
 
except
St.
Paul
's
thumb
  
<EOS>
God
's
flesh
and
God
's
fish
,
which
be
oath
monarchical
,
and
,
consider
who
make
them
,
not
much
amiss
;
and
as
king
oath
,
'
tis
not
much
matter
whether
they
be
fish
or
flesh
;
 
else
<EOS>
I
say
,
there
be
not
an
oath
,
or
at
least
a
curse
amongst
them
,
which
have
not
be
copy
over
and
over
again
out
of
Ernulphus
a
thousand
time
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
like
all
other
copy
,
how
infinitely
short
of
the
force
and
spirit
of
the
original
!
 
<EOS>
it
be
think
to
be
no
bad
oath
 
and
by
itself
pass
very
well
 
<EOS>
"
g
-
d
damn
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
set
it
beside
Ernulphus
's
 
"
God
almighty
the
Father
<EOS>
damn
you
 
God
the
Son
damn
you
 
God
the
Holy
Ghost
<EOS>
damn
you
<EOS>
"
 
you
see
'
tis
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
orientality
in
his
,
we
can
not
rise
up
to
:
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
be
more
copious
in
his
invention
 
possess'd
<EOS>
more
of
the
excellency
of
a
swearer
 
have
such
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
human
frame
,
its
membrane
,
nerve
,
ligament
,
knitting
of
the
joint
,
and
articulation
,
 
<EOS>
that
when
Ernulphus
curse
 
no
part
escape
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
true
there
be
something
of
a
hardness
in
his
manner
 
and
,
as
in
Michael
Angelo
,
a
want
of
grace
 
<EOS>
but
then
there
be
such
a
greatness
of
gusto
!
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
generally
look'd
upon
every
thing
in
a
light
very
different
from
all
mankind
,
would
,
after
all
,
never
allow
this
to
be
an
original
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
rather
<EOS>
Ernulphus
's
anathema
,
as
an
institute
of
swearing
,
in
which
,
as
he
suspect
,
upon
the
decline
of
swear
in
some
milder
pontificate
,
Ernulphus
,
by
order
of
the
succeed
pope
,
have
with
great
learning
and
diligence
collect
together
all
the
law
of
it
;
 
for
the
same
reason
that
Justinian
,
in
the
decline
of
the
empire
,
have
order
his
chancellor
Tribonian
to
collect
the
roman
or
civil
law
all
together
into
one
code
or
digest
 
l
,
through
the
rust
of
time
 
and
the
fatality
of
all
thing
commit
to
oral
tradition
 
<EOS>
they
should
be
lose
to
the
world
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
reason
my
father
would
oft
-
time
affirm
,
there
be
not
an
oath
from
the
great
and
tremendous
oath
of
William
the
conqueror
(
by
the
splendour
of
God
)
down
to
the
low
oath
of
a
scavenger
<EOS>
(
damn
your
eye
)
which
be
not
to
be
find
in
Ernulphus
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
would
add
 
I
defy
a
man
to
swear
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
hypothesis
be
,
like
most
of
my
father
's
,
singular
and
ingenious
too
;
  
nor
have
I
any
objection
to
it
,
but
that
it
overturn
my
own
.
      
<EOS>
Bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
my
poor
mistress

ready
to

and
her

the
bottle
of

the

Dr

there

Susannah

<EOS>
you

the

twould
be

<EOS>
I
like
subordination
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby

<EOS>
and
but
for
it

after
the
reduction
of
Lisle

I
know
not
what
may
have
become
of
the
garrison
of
Ghent

in
the

for

in

(

my

horsical
reflection

though
full
as

<EOS>
do
I
know
,
Captain
Shandy
,
what
may
have
become
of
the
garrison
above
stair
,
in
the
mutiny
and
confusion
<EOS>
I
find
all
thing
be
in
at
present
,
but
for
the
subordination
of
finger
and
thumb
to
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
the
application
of
which
,
Sir
,
under
this
accident
of
mine
,
come
in
so
a
propos
,
<EOS>
that
without
it
,
the
cut
upon
my
thumb
may
have
be
feel
by
the
Shandy
family
,
as
long
as
the
Shandy
family
have
a
name
.
    
<EOS>
let
us
go
back
to
the
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
singular
stroke
of
eloquence
(
at
least
it
be
so
,
when
eloquence
flourish
at
Athens
and
Rome
,
and
would
be
so
now
,
do
orator
wear
mantle
)
not
to
mention
the
name
of
a
thing
,
when
you
have
the
thing
about
you
in
petto
,
ready
to
produce
,
pop
,
<EOS>
in
the
place
you
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
scar
,
an
axe
,
a
sword
,
a
pink'd
doublet
,
a
rusty
helmet
,
a
pound
and
a
half
of
pot-
ashe
in
an
urn
,
or
a
three
-
halfpenny
pickle
pot
 
but
above
all
,
a
tender
infant
royally
accoutre
.
 
<EOS>
Tho
'
if
it
be
too
young
,
and
the
oration
as
long
as
Tully
's
second
philippick
 
it
must
certainly
have
beshit
the
orator
's
mantle
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
again
,
if
too
old
,
 
it
must
have
be
unwieldly
and
incommodious
to
his
action
 
so
as
to
make
him
lose
by
his
child
almost
as
much
as
he
could
gain
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
otherwise
,
when
a
state
orator
have
hit
the
precise
age
to
a
minute
 
hide
his
Bambino
in
his
mantle
so
cunningly
that
no
mortal
could
smell
it
 
and
produce
it
so
critically
,
that
no
soul
could
say
,
it
come
in
by
head
and
shoulder
 
<EOS>
oh
Sirs
!
<EOS>
it
have
do
wonder
 
<EOS>
It
have
open'd
<EOS>
the
sluice
,
and
turn'd
<EOS>
the
brain
,
and
shake
the
principle
,
and
unhinge
the
politick
of
half
a
nation
.
  
<EOS>
these
feat
however
be
not
to
be
do
,
except
in
those
state
and
time
,
I
say
,
where
orator
wear
mantle
 
and
pretty
large
one
too
,
my
brother
,
with
some
twenty
or
five
-
and
-
twenty
yard
of
good
purple
,
superfine
,
marketable
cloth
in
them
 
with
large
flow
fold
and
double
,
and
in
a
great
style
of
design
.
 
<EOS>
all
which
plainly
shew
,
may
it
please
your
worship
,
that
the
decay
of
eloquence
,
and
the
little
good
service
it
do
at
present
,
both
within
and
without
door
,
be
owe
to
nothing
else
in
the
world
,
but
short
coat
,
and
the
disuse
of
trunk
-
hose
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
conceal
nothing
under
ours
,
Madam

worth
shewing

<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
be
within
an
ace
of
be
an
exception
to
all
this
argumentation
:
 
for
happen
to
have
his
green
baize
bag
upon
his
knee
,
when
he
begin
to
parody
my
uncle
Toby
 
'
twas
as
good
as
the
good
mantle
in
the
world
to
him
:
 
for
which
purpose
,
when
he
foresee
the
sentence
would
end
in
his
new-
invent
forceps
,
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
bag
in
order
to
have
them
ready
to
clap
in
,
when
your
reverence
take
so
much
notice
of
the
.
.
.
,
which
have
he
manage
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
have
certainly
be
overthrow
:
 
the
sentence
and
the
argument
in
that
case
jump
closely
in
one
point
,
so
like
the
two
line
which
form
the
salient
angle
of
a
ravelin
,
 
Dr.
Slop
would
never
have
give
them
up
;
 
and
my
uncle
Toby
would
as
soon
have
think
of
flying
,
as
take
them
by
force
:
 
but
Dr.
Slop
fumble
so
vilely
in
pull
them
out
<EOS>
,
it
take
off
the
whole
effect
,
and
what
be
a
ten
time
bad
evil
(
for
they
seldom
come
alone
in
this
life
)
in
pull
out
his
forceps
,
his
forceps
unfortunately
draw
out
the
squirt
along
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
a
proposition
can
be
take
in
two
sense
 
'
tis
a
law
in
disputation
,
that
the
respondent
may
reply
to
which
of
the
two
he
please
,
or
find
most
convenient
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
throw
the
advantage
of
the
argument
quite
on
my
uncle
Toby
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
God

"
cry
my

Toby

<EOS>
upon

you
have

every

quite
off
the

of
both
my

with
your

cry
my

Toby
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
<EOS>
crush'd
<EOS>
all
my
knuckle
into
the
bargain
with
them
to
a
jelly
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
your
own
fault
,
say
Dr.
Slop
 
you
should
have
clinch'd
<EOS>
your
two
fist
together
into
the
form
of
a
child
's
head
as
I
tell
you
,

sit
firm

<EOS>
I
do
so
,
answer
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
point
of
my
forceps
have
not
be
sufficiently
arm'd
,
or
the
rivet
want
close
 
or
else
the
cut
on
my

have
make
me
a

possibility
 
that
the
experiment
be
not
first
make
upon
my
child
's
head
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
be
a
cherry
-
stone
the
bad
,
answer
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
I
maintain
it
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
it
would
have
break
the
cerebellum
(
unless
indeed
the
skull
have
be
as
hard
as
a
granado
)
and
turn'd
<EOS>
it
all
into
a
perfect
posset
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
reply
Dr.
Slop
,
a
child
's
head
be
naturally
as
soft
as
the
pap
of
an
apple
;
 
the
suture
give
way
 
and
besides
,
I
could
have
extract
by
the
foot
after
.
 
<EOS>
not
you
,
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
wish
you
would
begin
that
way
,
quoth
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
do
,
add
my
uncle
Toby
.
      
<EOS>
and
pray
,
good
woman
,
after
all
,
will
you
take
upon
you
to
say
,
it
may
not
be
the
child
's
hip
,
as
well
as
the
child
's
head
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
most
certainly
the
head
,
reply
the
midwife
.
 
<EOS>
because
,
continue
Dr.
Slop
<EOS>
(
turn
to
my
father
)
<EOS>
as
positive
as
these
old
lady
generally
be
 
'
<EOS>
tis
a
point
very
difficult
to
know
 
and
yet
of
the
great
consequence
to
be
know
;
  
because
,
Sir
,
if
the
hip
be
mistake
for
the
head
 
there
be
a
possibility
(
if
it
be
a
boy
)
<EOS>
that
the
forceps
.
.
<EOS>
..
    
<EOS>
what
the
possibility
be
,
Dr.
Slop
whisper
very
low
to
my
father
,
and
then
to
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
danger
,
continue
he
,
with
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
in
truth
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
 
<EOS>
but
when
your
possibility
have
take
place
at
the
hip
 
<EOS>
you
may
as
well
take
off
the
head
too
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
morally
impossible
the
reader
should
understand
this
 
'
<EOS>
tis
enough
Dr.
Slop
understand
it
;
 
so
take
the
green
baize
bag
in
his
hand
,
with
the
help
of
Obadiah
's
pump
,
he
tripp'd
pretty
nimbly
,
for
a
man
of
his
size
,
across
the
room
to
the
door
 
and
from
the
door
be
shew
the
way
,
by
the
good
old
midwife
,
to
my
mother
's
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
two
hour
,
and
ten
minute
 
and
no
more
 
cry
my
father
,
look
at
his
watch
,
since
Dr.
Slop
and
Obadiah
arrive
 
<EOS>
and
I
know
not
how
it
happen
,
<EOS>
Brother
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
to
my

it
seem
almost
an
age

<EOS>
here
 
pray
,
Sir

take
hold
of
my
cap
 
nay
,
take
the
bell
along
with
it

my
pantoufle

<EOS>
now
,
Sir

they
be
all
at

I
freely
make
you
a

'em

on

you

me
all
your

to
this
chapter

though
my

,
"
he

he

very
well
how
it
happen'd

at
the
instant
he
speak
it
,
be
pre

determined
in
his
mind
to
give
my
uncle
Toby
a
clear
account
of
the
matter
by
a
metaphysical
dissertation
upon
the
subject
of
duration
and
its
simple
mode
,
in
order
to
shew
my
uncle
Toby
by
what
mechanism
and
mensuration
in
the
brain
<EOS>
it
come
to
pass
,
that
the
rapid
succession
of
their
idea
,
and
the
eternal
scampering
of
the
discourse
from
one
thing
to
another
,
since
Dr.
Slop
have
come
into
the
room
,
have
lengthen
out
so
short
a
period
to
so
inconceivable
an
extent
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

how
it

my

"
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
owe
entirely
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
the
succession
of
our
idea
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
have
an
itch
,
in
common
with
all
philosopher
,
of
reason
upon
every
thing
which
happen
,
and
account
for
it
too
 
propose
infinite
pleasure
to
himself
in
this
,
of
the
succession
of
idea
,
and
have
not
the
least
apprehension
of
have
it
snatch'd
out
of
his
hand
by
my
uncle
Toby
,
who
(
honest
man

)
<EOS>
generally
take
every
thing
as
it
happen

and
who
,
of
all
thing
in
the
world
,
trouble
his
brain
the
least
with
abstruse
thinking
;
 
the
idea
of
time
and
space
 
or
how
we
come
by
those
idea
 
or
of
what
stuff
they
be
make
 
or
whether
they
be
bear
with
us
  
or
we
pick
them
up
afterwards
as
we
go
along
 
or
whether
we
do
it
in
frock
 
or
not
till
we
have
get
into
breech
 
with
a
thousand
other
inquiry
and
dispute
about
Infinity
Prescience

Liberty

Necessity

fortuitous

do
you

my

<EOS>
not
I

my

you

<EOS>

<EOS>
twere
almost

I
will
tell
thee

<EOS>
to
understand
what
time
be
aright
,
without
which
we
never
can
comprehend
infinity
,
insomuch
as
one
be
a
portion
of
the
other
 
we
ought
seriously
to
sit
down
and
consider
what
idea
it
be
we
have
of
duration
,
so
as
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
how
we
come
by
it

what
be
that
to

my

(

for
if

your

inward

continue
my

and
observe
attentively

you
will
perceive
,

that
whilst
you
and
I
be
talk
together
,
and
think
,
and
smoke
our
pipe
,
or
whilst
we
receive
successively
idea
in
our
mind
,
we
know
that
we
do
exist

and
so
we
estimate
the
existence
,
or
the
continuation
of
the
existence
of
ourselves
,
or
any
thing
else
,
commensurate
to
the

in
our

the
duration
of
ourselves

any
such

co

<EOS>
You
puzzle
me
to
death
,
cry
my

Toby

<EOS>
'
Tis
owe
to
this
,
reply
my

,
that
in
our
computation
of
time
,
we
be
so
used
to
minute
,
hour
,
week
,
and
month
 
and
of
clock
(
I
wish
there
be
not
a
clock

to
measure
out
their
several

to
us

and
to
those
who
belong
to
us
 
<EOS>
that
'
twill
be
well
,
if
in

to
come
,
the
succession
of
our
idea
be
of
any
use
or
service
to
us
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
whether
we
observe
it
or
no
,
continue
my
father
,
in
every
sound
man
's
head
,
there
be
a
regular
succession
of
idea
of
one
sort
or
other
,
which
follow
each
other
in
train
just
like
 
a
train
of
artillery
?
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
a
train
of
a
fiddle
-
stick
!
 
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
 
which
follow
and
succeed
one
another
in
our
mind
at
certain
distance
,
just
like
the
image
in
the
inside

lanthorn
turn
round

heat
of

I
declare
,
quoth
<EOS>
my

Toby

mine
be
more
like
a

then
,
brother
Toby

I
have
nothing
more
to

to
you
upon

my

<EOS>
My

in
eager
pursuit
of
a
metaphysical
point
into
the
very

,
where
cloud

thick
darkness
would
soon
have
encompass
it
about

my
uncle
Toby
in
one
of
the
fine
disposition
for
it
in
the
world
;
 
his
head
like
a
smoke

jack
;
 
the
funnel
unswept

and
the

whirl
round
and
round
about

all
obfuscate

fuliginous

<EOS>
my

my

Toby

discourse
upon
Time
and
Eternity
 
be
a
discourse
devoutly
to

for

<EOS>
and
the
petulancy
of
my
father
's
humour
,
in
put
a
stop
to
it
as
he
do

be
a
robbery
of

Tho

my

he

my

Toby

smoke
-
jack
out
of
his

pique
as
he
be
at
first
with
it
;
 
there
be
something
in
the
comparison
at
the
bottom
,
which
hit
his
fancy
;
for
which
purpose
,
rest
his
elbow
upon
the
table
,
and
recline
the
right
side
of
his
head
upon
the
palm
of
his

but
look
first
stedfastly
in
the
fire
 
he
begin
to
commune
with
himself
,
and
philosophize
about
it
:
 
but
his
spirit
be
wear
out
with
the
fatigue
of
investigate
new

and
the
constant
exertion
of
his
faculty
upon
that
variety
of

which
have
take

the

all
the

the
judgment
<EOS>
(
be

which
the
great

Bestower
of

fit

to

so

<EOS>
now

Agalastes

no
judgment
at

<EOS>
and
Triptolemus
and
Phutatorius
agree
thereto
,
ask
,
how
be
it
possible
there
should
?
<EOS>
for
that
wit
and
judgment
in
this
world
never
go
together
;
inasmuch
as
they
be
two
operation
differ
from
each
other
as
wide

<EOS>
so
,
say
Locke
 
so
be
fart

to
this
,
Didius
the
great
church

in
his
code
de
fartendi

doth
maintain

fully

that
an

be
no
argument
 
nor
do
I
maintain
the
wiping
of

you
all

may
it
please
your

see
the
well
for
it
 
so
that
the
main
good
these
thing
do
be
only
to
clarify
the
understanding
,
previous
to
the
application
of
the
argument
itself
,
in
order
to
free
it
from
any
little
mote

speck
of
opacular

oh

I

<EOS>
I
grow
something
well
again
,
for
I
be
begin
to
foresee
,
when
this
be
over
,
that
as
we
shall
all
of
us
continue
to
be
great
wit
 
<EOS>
we
should
never
agree
amongst
ourselves
,
one
day
to
an
end
:
 
there
would
be
so
much
satire
and
sarcasm
 
scoffing
and
flouting
,
with
raillying
and
reparteeing
of
it
 
thrust
and
parry
in
one
corner
or
another
 
there
would
be
nothing
but
mischief
among
us
 
chaste
star
!
<EOS>
what
bite
and
scratching
,
and
what
a
racket
and
a
clatter
we
should
make
,
<EOS>
what
with
breaking
of
head
,
rapping
of
knuckle
,
and
hit
of
sore
place
 
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
live
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
again
,
as
we
should
all
of
us
be
man
of
great
judgment
,
we
should
make
up
matter
as
fast
as
ever
they
go
wrong
;
and
though
we
should
abominate
each
other
ten
time
bad
than
so
many
devil
or
devilesse
,
we
should
nevertheless
,
my
dear
creature
,
be
all
courtesy
and
kindness
,
milk
and
honey
 
<EOS>
'
twould
be
a
second
land
of
promise
 
a
paradise
upon
earth
,
if
there
be
such
a
thing
to
be
have
 
so
that
upon
the
whole
we
should
have
do
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
all
I
fret
and
fume
at
,
and
what
most
distress
my
invention
at
present
,
be
how
to
bring
the
point
itself
to
bear
;
for
as
your
worship
well
know
,
that
of
these
heavenly
emanation
of
wit
and
judgment
,
which
I
have
so
bountifully
wish
both
for
your
worship
and
myself
 
there
be
but
a
certain
quantum
store
up
for
us
all
,
for
the
use
and
behoof
of
the
whole
race
of
mankind
;
and
such
small
modicum
of
'em
be
only
send
forth
into
this
wide
world
,
circulate
here
and
there
in
one
bye
corner
or
another
  
and
<EOS>
in
such
narrow
stream
,
and
at
such
prodigious
interval
from
each
other
,
that
one
would
wonder
how
it
hold
out
,
or
could
be
sufficient
for
the
want
and
emergency
of
so
many
great
estate
,
and
populous
empire
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
one
thing
to
be
consider
,
that
in
Nova
Zembla
,
North
Lapland
,
and
in
all
those
cold
and
dreary
track
of
the
globe
,
which
lie
more
directly
under
the
arctick
and
antartick
circle
,
where
the
whole
province
of
a
man
's
concernment
lie
for
near
nine
month
together
within
the
narrow
compass
of
his
cave
 
<EOS>
where
the
spirit
be
compress
almost
to
nothing
 
and
where
the
passion
of
a
man
,
with
every
thing
which
belong
to
them
,
be
as
frigid
as
the
zone
itself
 
there
the
least
quantity
of
judgment
imaginable
do
the
business
 
and
of
wit
 
there
be
a
total
and
an
absolute
saving
 
for
as
not
one
spark
<EOS>
be
want
 
<EOS>
so
not
one
spark
be
give
.
 
<EOS>
Angels
and
minister
of
grace
defend
us
!
<EOS>
what
a
dismal
thing
would
it
have
be
to
have
govern
a
kingdom
,
to
have
fight
a
battle
,
or
make
a
treaty
,
or
run
a
match
,
or
write
a
book
,
or
get
a
child
,
or
hold
a
provincial
chapter
there
,
with
so
plentiful
a
lack
of
wit
and
judgment
about
us
!
 
<EOS>
for
mercy
's
sake
,
let
us
think
no
more
about
it
,
but
travel
on
as
fast
as
we
can
southwards
into
Norway
 
crossing
over
Swedeland
,
if
you
please
,
through
the
small
triangular
province
of
Angermania
to
the
lake
of
Bothmia
;
coast
along
it
through
east
and
west
Bothnia
,
down
to
Carelia
,
and
so
on
,
through
all
those
state
and
province
which
border
upon
the
far
side
of
the
Gulf
of
Finland
,
and
the
north
-
east
of
the
Baltick
,
up
to
Petersbourg
,
and
just
step
into
Ingria
;
 
then
stretch
over
directly
from
thence
through
the
north
part
of
the
russian
empire
 
leave
Siberia
a
little
upon
the
left
hand
,
till
we
get
into
the
very
heart
of
russian
and
Asiatick
Tartary
.
  
<EOS>
now
through
this
long
tour
which
I
have
lead
you
,
you
observe
the
good
people
be
well
off
by
far
,
than
in
the
polar
country
which
we
have
just
leave
:
 
for
if
you
hold
your
hand
over
your
eye
,
and
look
very
attentively
,
you
may
perceive
some
small
glimmering
(
as
it
be
)
of
wit
,
with
a
comfortable
provision
of
good
plain
houshold
judgment
,
which
,
take
the
quality
and
quantity
of
it
together
,
they
make
a
very
good
shift
with
  
and
have
they
more
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
,
it
would
destroy
the
proper
balance
betwixt
them
,
and
I
be
satisfied
moreover
they
would
want
occasion
to
put
them
to
use
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
,
if
I
conduct
you
home
again
into
this
warm
and
more
luxuriant
island
,
where
you
perceive
the
spring
-
tide
of
our
blood
and
humours
run
high
 
where
we
have
more
ambition
,
and
pride
,
and
envy
,
and
lechery
,
and
other
whoreson
passion
upon
our
hand
to
govern
and
subject
to
reason
 
the
height
of
our
wit
,
and
the
depth
of
our
judgment
,
you
see
,
be
exactly
proportion
to
the
length
and
breadth
of
our
necessity
 
and
accordingly
we
have
them
send
down
amongst
us
in
such
a
flowing
kind
of
decent
and
creditable
plenty
,
that
no
one
think
he
have
any
cause
to
complain
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
however
be
confess
on
this
head
,
that
,
as
our
air
blow
hot
and
cold
 
wet
and
dry
,
ten
time
in
a
day
,
we
have
them
in
no
regular
and
settle
way
;
 
so
that
sometimes
for
near
half
a
century
together
,
there
shall
be
very
little
wit
or
judgment
either
to
be
see
or
hear
of
amongst
us
:
 
<EOS>
the
small
channel
of
them
shall
seem
quite
dry
up
 
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
sluice
shall
break
out
,
and
take
a
fit
of
run
again
like
fury
 
<EOS>
you
would
think
they
would
never
stop
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
,
that
in
writing
,
and
fighting
,
and
twenty
other
gallant
thing
,
we
drive
all
the
world
before
us
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
by
these
observation
,
and
a
wary
reasoning
by
analogy
in
that
kind
of
argumentative
process
,
which
Suidas
call
dialectick
induction
 
that
I
draw
and
set
up
this
position
as
most
true
and
veritable
;
  
that
of
these
two
luminary
so
much
of
their
irradiation
be
suffer
from
time
to
time
to
shine
down
upon
us
,
as
he
,
whose
infinite
wisdom
which
dispense
every
thing
in
exact
weight
and
measure
,
know
will
just
serve
to
light
us
on
our
way
in
this
night
of
our
obscurity
;
so
that
your
reverence
and
worship
now
find
out
,
nor
be
it
a
moment
longer
in
my
power
to
conceal
it
from
you
,
that
the
fervent
wish
in
your
behalf
with
which
I
set
out
,
be
no
more
than
the
first
insinuate
how
d'ye
of
a
caress
prefacer
,
stifle
his
reader
,
as
a
lover
sometimes
do
a
coy
mistress
,
into
silence
.
 
<EOS>
for
alas
!
<EOS>
could
this
effusion
of
light
have
be
as
easily
procure
,
as
the
exordium
wish
it
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
think
how
many
thousand
for
it
,
of
benighted
traveller
(
in
the
learn
science
at
least
)
must
have
grope
and
blunder
on
in
the
dark
,
<EOS>
all
the
night
of
their
life
  
run
their
head
against
post
,
and
knock
out
their
brain
without
ever
get
to
their
journie
end
;
 
some
fall
with
their
nose
perpendicularly
into
sink
 
other
horizontally
with
their
tail
into
kennel
.
 
<EOS>
here
one
half
of
a
learned
profession
tilting
full
but
against
the
other
half
of
it
,
and
then
tumble
and
roll
one
over
the
other
in
the
dirt
like
hog
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
brother
of
another
profession
,
who
should
have
run
in
opposition
to
each
other

fly
on
the
contrary
like
a
flock
of
wild
goose

all
in
a
row
the
same

<EOS>
what
confusion

<EOS>
what
mistake

<EOS>
fiddler

by
their

to
the
passion
excite
 
in
an
air
sung

a

them
by

<EOS>
in
the

a

turn
the

like

the

round
 
against
the

corruption
 
by
Heaven

<EOS>
in
this
corner

a

of
the
divine
Esculapius

write
a
book
against
predestination
;
perhaps
bad
 
feel
his

his
apothecary

a

of

ground
upon
his
knee
in
tear
 
draw
the

beg
his
forgiveness

vexatious

the

kick
it
out

such

fasten

stick
slightly

will
place
what
I
have
to

clear

you
see
through
the

same
chair
on
which
I
be
sit
.
    
<EOS>
You
see
,
they
be
the
high
and
most
ornamental
part
of
its
frame
 
as
wit
and
judgment
be
of
ours
 
and
like
them
too
,
indubitably
both
make
and
fit
to
go
together
,
in
order
,
as
we
say
in
all
such
case
of
duplicate
embellishment
 
to
answer
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
now
for
the
sake
of
an
experiment
,
and
for
the
clear
illustrate
this
matter
 
let
us
for
a
moment
take
off
one
of
these
two
curious
ornament
(
I
care
not
which
)
from
the
point
or
pinnacle
of
the
chair
it
now
stand
on
  
nay
,
do
not
laugh
at
it
,
 
but
do
you
ever
see
,
in
the
whole
course
of
your
life
,
such
a
ridiculous
business
as
this
have
make
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
'
tis
as
miserable
a
sight
as
a
sow
with
one
ear
;
and
there
be
just
as
much
sense
and
symmetry
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
:
 
do
 
pray
,
get
off
your
seat
only
to
take
a
view
of
it
,
 
now
<EOS>
would
any
man
who
value
his
character
a
straw
,
have
turn
a
piece
of
work
out
of
his
hand
in
such
a
condition
?
 
<EOS>
nay
,
lie
your
hand
upon
your
heart
,
and
answer
this
plain
question
,
whether
this
one
single
knob
,
which
now
stand
here
like
a
blockhead
by
itself
,
can
serve
any
purpose
upon
earth
,
but
to
put
one
in
mind
of
the
want
of
the
other
?
 
and
let
me
farther
ask
,
in
case
the
chair
be
your
own
,
if
you
would
not
in
your
conscience
think
,
rather
than
be
as
it
be
,
that
it
would
be
ten
time
well
without
any
knob
at
all
?
  
<EOS>
now
these
two
knob
 
or
top
ornament
of
the
mind
of
man
,
which
crown
the
whole
entablature
 
<EOS>
be
,
as
I
say
,
wit
and
judgment
,
which
of
all
other
,
as
I
have
prove
it
,
be
the
most
needful
 
the
most
<EOS>
priz'd
 
the
most
calamitous
to
be
without
,
and
consequently
the
hard
to
come
at
 
for
all
these
reason
put
together
<EOS>
,
there
be
not
a
mortal
among
us
,
<EOS>
so
destitute
of
a
love
of
good
fame
or
feeding
 
or
so
ignorant
of
what
will
do
him
good
therein
 
who
do
not
wish
and
stedfastly
resolve
in
his
own
mind
,
to
be
,
or
to
be
think
at
least
,
master
of
the
one
or
the
other
,
and
indeed
of
both
of
them
,
if
the
thing
seem
any
way
feasible
,
or
likely
to
be
bring
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
now
your
graver
gentry
have
little
or
no
kind
of
chance
in
aim
at
the
one
 
unless
they
lay
hold
of
the
other
,
 
pray
what
do
you
think
would
become
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
Sirs
,
in
spite
of
all
their
gravity
,
they
must
e'en
have
be
content
to
have
go
with
their
inside
<EOS>
naked
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
to
be
bear
,
but
by
an
effort
of
philosophy
not
to
be
suppose
in
the
case
we
be
upon
 
so
that
no
one
could
well
have
be
angry
with
them
,
have
they
be
satisfied
with
what
little
they
could
have
snatch
up
and
secrete
under
their
cloak
and
great
perriwig
,
<EOS>
have
they
not
raise
a
hue
and
cry
at
the
same
time
against
the
lawful
owner
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
your
worship
,
that
this
be
do
with
so
much
cunning
and
artifice
 
that
the
great
Locke
,
who
be
seldom
outwit
by
false
sound
  
<EOS>
be
nevertheless
bubble
here
.
 
<EOS>
the
cry
,
it
seem
,
be
so
deep
and
solemn
a
one
,
and
what
with
the
help
of
great
wig
<EOS>
,
grave
face
,
and
other
implement
of
deceit
,
be
render
so
general
a
one
against
the
poor
wit
in
this
matter
,
that
the
philosopher
himself
be
deceive
by
it
 
<EOS>
it
be
his
glory
to
free
the
world
from
the
lumber
of
a
thousand
vulgar
error
;
 
but
this
be
not
of
the
number
;
so
that
instead
of
sit
down
coolly
,
as
such
a
philosopher
should
have
do
,
to
have
examine
the
matter
of
fact
<EOS>
before
he
philosophise
upon
it
 
on
the
contrary
he
take
the
fact
for
grant
,
and
so
joined
in
with
the
cry
,
and
<EOS>
halloo'd
<EOS>
it
as
boisterously
as
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
this
have
be
make
the
Magna
Charta
of
stupidity
ever
since
 
but
your
reverence
plainly
see
,
it
have
be
obtain
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
title
to
it
be
not
worth
a
groat
:
 
which
by
-
the
-
bye
be
one
of
the
many
and
vile
imposition
which
gravity
and
grave
folk
have
to
answer
for
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
great
wig
,
upon
which
I
may
be
think
to
have
speak
my
mind
too
freely
 
<EOS>
I
beg
leave
to
qualify
whatever
have
be
unguardedly
say
to
their
dispraise
or
prejudice
,
by
one
general
declaration
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
no
abhorrence
whatever
,
nor
do
I
detest
and
abjure
<EOS>
either
great
wig
or
long
beard
,
any
farther
than
when
I
see
they
be
bespoke
and
let
grow
on
purpose
to
carry
on
this
self
-
same
imposture
 
for
any
purpose
 
peace
be
with
them!--

<EOS>
mark
only
 
<EOS>
I
write
not
for
them
.
    
<EOS>
every
day
for
at
least
ten
year
together
do
my
father
resolve
to
have
it
mend
 
'
tis
not
mend
yet
;
 
no
family
but
ours
would
have
bear
with
it
an
hour
 
and
what
be
most
astonishing
,
there
be
not
a
subject
in
the
world
upon
which
my
father
be
so
eloquent
,
as
upon
that
of
door
-
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
at
the
same
time
,
he
be
certainly
one
of
the
great
bubble
to
them
,
I
think
,
that
history
can
produce
:
 
<EOS>
his
rhetorick
and
conduct
be
at
perpetual
handy
-
cuff
.
 
<EOS>
never
do
the
parlour
-
door
open
 
but
<EOS>
his
philosophy
or
his
principle
fall
a
victim
to
it
;
 
three
drop
of
oil
with
a
feather
,
and
a
smart
stroke
of
a
hammer
,
have
save
his
honour
for
ever
.
    
<EOS>
Inconsistent
soul
that
man
be
!
 
<EOS>
languish
under
wound
,
which
he
have
the
power
to
heal
!
 
<EOS>
his
whole
life
a
contradiction
to
his
knowledge
!
 
<EOS>
his
reason
,
that
precious
gift
of
God
to
him
 
(
instead
of
pour
in
oil
)
serve
but
to
sharpen
his
sensibility
 
to
multiply
his
pain
,
and
render
him
more
melancholy
and
uneasy
under
them
!
 
<EOS>
poor
unhappy
creature
,
that
he
should
do
so
!
 
<EOS>
be
not
the
necessary
cause
of
misery
in
this
life
enow
,
but
he
must
add
voluntary
one
to
his
stock
of
sorrow
;
 
struggle
against
evil
which
can
not
be
avoid
,
and
submit
to
other
,
which
a
tenth
part
of
the
trouble
they
create
him
would
remove
from
his
heart
for
ever
?
  
<EOS>
by
all
that
be
good
and
virtuous
,
if
there
be
three
drop
of
oil
to
be
get
,
and
a
hammer
to
be
find
within
ten
mile
of
Shandy
Hall
 
<EOS>
the
parlour
door
hinge
shall
be
mend
this
reign
.
    
<EOS>
when
Corporal
Trim
have
bring
his
two
mortar
to
bear
,
he
be
delighted
with
his
handy
-
work
above
measure
;
and
know
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
his
master
to
see
them
,
he
be
not
able
to
resist
the
desire
he
have
of
carry
them
directly
into
his
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
now
next
to
the
moral
lesson
I
have
in
view
in
mention
the
affair
of
hinge
,
I
have
a
speculative
consideration
arise
out
of
it
,
and
it
be
this
.
  
<EOS>
have
the
parlour
door
open
and
turn'd
<EOS>
upon
its
hinge
,
as
a
door
should
do
    
<EOS>
or
for
example
,
as
cleverly
as
our
government
have
be
turn
upon
its
hinge
 
(
that
is
,
in
case
thing
have
all
along
go
well
with
your
worship
,
 
<EOS>
otherwise
I
give
up
my
simile
)
 
in
this
case
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
there
have
be
no
danger
either
to
master
or
man
,
in
corporal
Trim
's
peeping
in
:
 
<EOS>
the
moment
he
have
behold
my
father
and
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
fast
asleep
 
<EOS>
the
respectfulness
of
his
carriage
be
such
,
he
would
have
retire
as
silent
as
death
,
and
leave
them
both
in
their
arm
-
chair
,
dream
as
happy
as
he
have
find
them
:
 
but
the
thing
be
,
morally
speak
,
so
very
impracticable
,
that
for
the
many
year
in
which
this
hinge
be
suffer
to
be
out
of
order
,
and
amongst
the
hourly
grievance
my
father
submit
to
upon
its
account
 
this
be
one
;
that
he
never
fold
his
arm
to
take
his
nap
after
dinner
,
but
the
thought
of
be
unavoidably
awaken
by
the
first
person
who
should
open
the
door
,
be
always
uppermost
in
his
imagination
,
and
so
incessantly
stepp'd
<EOS>
in
betwixt
him
and
the
first
balmy
presage
of
his
repose
,
as
to
rob
him
,
as
he
often
declare
,
of
the
whole
sweet
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
thing
move
upon
bad
hinge
,
an
'
please
your
lordship
,
how
can
it
be
otherwise
?
"
  
<EOS>
pray
what
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
who
be
there
?
<EOS>
cry
my
father
,
waking
,
the
moment
the
door
begin
to
creak
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
smith
would
give
a
peep
at
that
confound
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
nothing
,
an

your
honour

say
Trim
,
but
two
mortar
I
be
bring
in

<EOS>
They
shall
not
make
a
clatter
with
them
here
,
cry
my
father
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
if
Dr.
Slop
have
any
drug
to
pound
,
let
him
do
it
in
the
kitchen

May
it

cry
my

spring
out
of
his

<EOS>
I

not

widely
as
my
father
mistake
the
mortar
:
 
but
to
understand
how
my
uncle
Toby
could
mistake
the
bridge
 
<EOS>
I
fear
I
must
give
you
an
exact
account
of
the
road
which
lead
to
it
;
 
or
to
drop
my
metaphor
(
for
there
be
nothing
more
dishonest
in
an
historian
than
the
use
of
one
)
 
in
order
to
conceive
the
probability
of
this
error
in
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
aright
,
I
must
give
you
some
account
of
an
adventure
of
Trim
's
,
though
much
against
my
will
<EOS>
,
I
say
much
against
my
will
,
only
because
the
story
,
in
one
sense
,
be
certainly
out
of
its
place
here
;
for
by
right
it
should
come
in
,
either
amongst
the
anecdote
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
with
widow
Wadman
,
in
which
corporal
Trim
be
no
mean
actor
 
or
else
in
the
middle
of
his
and
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaign
on
the
bowling
-
green
 
for
it
will
do
very
well
in
either
place
;
 
but
then
if
I
reserve
it
for
either
of
those
part
of
my
story
 
<EOS>
I
ruin
the
story
I
be
upon
;
 
and
if
I
tell
it
here
 
I
anticipate
matter
,
and
ruin
it
there
.
    
<EOS>
what
would
your
worship
have
me
to
do
in
this
case
?
    
<EOS>
tell
it
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
by
all
mean
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
fool
,
Tristram
,
if
you
do
.
  
<EOS>
o
ye
power
!
<EOS>
(
for
power
ye
be
,
and
great
one
too
)
 
<EOS>
which
enable
mortal
man
to
tell
a
story
worth
the
hearing
 
that
kindly
shew
him
,
where
he
be
to
begin
it
 
and
where
he
be
to
end
it
 
what
he
be
to
put
into
it
 
and
what
he
be
to
leave
out
 
how
much
of
it
he
be
to
cast
into
a
shade
 
and
whereabout
<EOS>
he
be
to
throw
his
light
!
 
<EOS>
Ye
,
who
preside
over
this
vast
empire
of
biographical
freebooter
,
and
see
how
many
scrape
and
plunge
your
subject
hourly
fall
into
;
 
<EOS>
will
you
do
one
thing
?
  
<EOS>
I
beg
and
beseech
you
(
in
case
you
will
do
nothing
well
for
us
)
that
wherever
in
any
part
of
your
dominion
it
so
fall
out
,
that
three
several
road
meet
in
one
point
,
as
they
have
do
just
here
 
that
at
least
you
set
up
a
guide
-
post
in
the
centre
of
them
,
in
mere
charity
,
to
direct
an
uncertain
devil
which
of
the
three
he
be
to
take
.
     
<EOS>
Tho
'
the
shock
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
receive
the
year
after
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
in
his
affair
with
widow
Wadman
,
have
fix
him
in
a
resolution
never
more
to
think
of
the
sex
 
or
of
aught
which
belong
to
it
;
 
yet
corporal
Trim
have
make
no
such
bargain
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
case
there
be
a
strange
and
unaccountable
concurrence
of
circumstance
,
which
insensibly
draw
him
in
,
to
lay
siege
to
that
fair
and
strong
citadel
.
 
<EOS>
in
Trim
's
case
there
be
a
concurrence
of
nothing
in
the
world
,
but
of
him
and
Bridget
in
the
kitchen
;
 
though
in
truth
,
the
love
and
veneration
he
bear
his
master
be
such
,
and
so
fond
be
he
of
imitate
him
in
all
he
do
,
<EOS>
that
have
my
uncle
Toby
employ
his
time
and
genius
in
tagging
of
point
 
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
the
honest
corporal
would
have
lay
down
his
arm
,
and
follow
his
example
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
when
therefore
my
uncle
Toby
sit
down
before
the
mistress
 
<EOS>
corporal
Trim
incontinently
take
ground
before
the
maid
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
friend
Garrick
,
whom
I
have
so
much
cause
to
esteem
and
honour
 
(
why
,
or
wherefore
,
'
tis
no
matter
)
 
<EOS>
can
it
escape
your
penetration
 
<EOS>
I
defy
it
 
that
so
many
play
-
wright
,
and
opificer
of
chit-
chat
have
ever
since
be
work
upon
Trim
's
and
my
uncle
Toby
's
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
I
care
not
<EOS>
what
Aristotle
,
or
Pacuvius
,
or
Bossu
,
or
Ricaboni
say
 
<EOS>
(
though
I
never
read
one
of
them
)
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
great
difference
between
a
single
-
horse
chair
and
madam
Pompadour
's
vis
-
a
-
vis
;
than
betwixt
a
single
amour
,
and
an
amour
thus
nobly
double
,
and
go
upon
all
four
,
prance
throughout
a
grand
drama
 
Sir
,
a
simple
,
single
,
silly
affair
of
that
kind
 
be
quite
lose
in
five
act
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
neither
here
nor
there
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
series
of
attack
and
repulse
in
a
course
of
nine
month
on
my
uncle
Toby
's
quarter
,
a
most
minute
account
of
every
particular
of
which
shall
be
give
in
its
proper
place
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
honest
man
!
<EOS>
find
it
necessary
to
draw
off
his
force
and
raise
the
siege
somewhat
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
,
as
I
say
,
have
make
no
such
bargain
either
with
himself
 
or
with
any
one
else
 
the
fidelity
however
of
his
heart
not
suffer
him
to
go
into
a
house
which
his
master
have
forsake
with
disgust
 
<EOS>
he
content
himself
with
turn
his
part
of
the
siege
into
a
blockade
;
 
that
is
,
he
keep
other
off
;
 
for
though
he
never
after
go
to
the
house
,
yet
he
never
meet
Bridget
in
the
village
,
but
he
would
either
nod
or
wink
,
or
smile
,
or
look
kindly
at
her
 
<EOS>
or
(
as
circumstance
direct
)
<EOS>
he
would
shake
her
by
the
hand
 
or
ask
her
lovingly
how
she
do
 
or
would
give
her
a
ribbon
 
and
now
-
and
-
then
,
though
<EOS>
never
but
when
it
could
be
do
with
decorum
,
would
give
Bridget
a.
.
.
    
<EOS>
precisely
in
this
situation
,
do
these
thing
stand
for
five
year
;
that
be
from
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
in
the
year
13
,
to
the
latter
end
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaign
in
the
year
18
,
which
be
about
six
or
seven
week
before
the
time
I
be
speak
of
.
 
<EOS>
when
Trim
,
as
his
custom
be
,
after
he
have
put
my
uncle
Toby
to
bed
,
go
down
one
moon
-
shiny
night
to
see
that
every
thing
be
right
at
his
fortification
 
in
the
lane
separate
from
the
bowling
-
green
with
flower
shrub
and
holly
 
<EOS>
he
espy
his
Bridget
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
corporal
thought
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
<EOS>
so
well
worth
shew
as
the
glorious
work
which
he
and
my
uncle
Toby
have
make
,
trim
courteously
and
gallantly
take
her
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
her
in
:
this
be
not
do
so
privately
,
but
that
the
foul
-
mouth'd
trumpet
of
Fame
carry
it
from
ear
to
ear
,
till
at
length
it
<EOS>
reach'd
<EOS>
my
father
's
,
with
this
untoward
circumstance
along
with
it
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
curious
draw
-
bridge
,
construct
and
paint
after
the
dutch
fashion
,
and
which
go
quite
across
the
ditch
 
be
break
down
,
and
somehow
or
other
crush
all
to
piece
that
very
night
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
as
you
have
observe
,
have
no
great
esteem
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
hobby
-
horse
;
he
think
it
the
most
ridiculous
horse
that
ever
gentleman
mount
;
and
indeed
unless
my
uncle
Toby
vex
him
about
it
,
could
never
think
of
it
once
,
without
smile
at
it
 
so
that
it
could
never
get
lame
or
happen
any
mischance
,
but
it
tickle
my
father
's
imagination
beyond
measure
;
but
this
be
an
accident
much
more
to
his
humour
than
any
one
which
have
yet
<EOS>
befall'n
<EOS>
it
,
it
prove
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
entertainment
to
him
 
<EOS>
well
 
but
<EOS>
dear
Toby
!
<EOS>
my
father
would
say
,
do
tell
me
seriously
how
this
affair
of
the
bridge
happen
.
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
teaze
me
so
much
about
it
?
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
would
reply
 
<EOS>
I
have
tell
it
you
twenty
time
,
word
for
word
as
Trim
tell
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
Prithee
<EOS>
,
how
be
it
then
,
corporal
?
<EOS>
my
father
would
cry
,
turn
to
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
mere
misfortune
,
an
'
please
your
honour
;
 
I
be
shew
Mrs.
Bridget
our
fortification
,
and
in
go
too
near
the
edge
of
the
fosse
,
I
unfortunately
slipp'd
in
 
very
well
,
trim
!
<EOS>
my
father
would
cry
 
(
smile
mysteriously
,
and
give
a
nod
 
but
without
interrupt
him
)
 
and
be
link'd
fast
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
arm
in
arm
with
Mrs.
Bridget
,
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
dragg'd
her
after
me
,
by
mean
of
which
she
fall
backwards
soss
against
the
bridge
 
and
Trim
's
foot
(
my
uncle
Toby
would
cry
,
take
the
story
out
of
his
mouth
)
<EOS>
get
into
the
cuvette
,
he
tumble
full
against
the
bridge
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
thousand
to
one
,
my
uncle
Toby
would
add
,
that
the
poor
fellow
do
not
break
his
leg
.
 
<EOS>
ay
<EOS>
truly
,
my
father
would
say
 
a
limb
be
soon
break
,
brother
Toby
,
in
such
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
the
bridge
,
which
your
honour
know
be
a
very
slight
one
,
be
break
down
betwixt
us
,
and
splinter
all
to
piece
.
  
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
but
especially
when
my
uncle
Toby
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
say
a
syllable
about
cannon
,
bomb
,
or
petard
 
<EOS>
my
father
would
exhaust
all
the
store
of
his
eloquence
(
which
indeed
be
very
great
)
in
a
panegyric
upon
the
Battering
-
Rams
of
the
ancient
 
the
Vinea
which
Alexander
make
use
of
at
the
siege
of
Troy
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
tell
my
uncle
Toby
of
the
Catapultae
of
the
Syrians
,
which
throw
such
monstrous
stone
so
many
hundred
foot
,
and
shake
the
strong
bulwark
from
their
very
foundation
:
 
he
would
go
on
and
describe
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
the
Ballista
which
Marcellinus
make
so
much
rout
about
!
 
<EOS>
the
terrible
effect
of
the
Pyraboli
,
which
cast
fire
;
 
the
danger
of
the
Terebra
and
Scorpio
,
which
cast
javelin
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
these
,
would
he
say
,
to
the
destructive
machinery
of
corporal
trim
?
 
<EOS>
believe
me
,
brother
Toby
,
no
bridge
,
or
bastion
,
or
sally
-
port
,
that
ever
be
construct
in
this
world
,
can
hold
out
against
such
artillery
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
would
never
attempt
any
defence
against
the
force
of
this
ridicule
,
but
that
of
redouble
the
vehemence
of
smoake
his
pipe
;
in
do
which
,
he
raise
so
dense
a
vapour
one
night
after
supper
,
that
it
set
my
father
,
who
be
a
little
phthisical
,
into
a
suffocate
fit
of
violent
coughing
:
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
leap'd
up
without
feel
the
pain
upon
his
groin
 
and
,
with
infinite
pity
,
stand
beside
his
brother
's
chair
,
tap
his
back
with
one
hand
,
and
hold
his
head
with
the
other
,
and
from
time
to
time
wipe
his
eye
with
a
clean
cambrick
handkerchief
,
which
he
pull
out
of
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
the
affectionate
and
endearing
manner
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
do
these
little
office
 
<EOS>
cut
my
father
thro
'
his
rein
,
for
the
pain
he
have
just
be
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
May
my
brain
be
knock'd
out
with
a
battering
-
ram
or
a
catapulta
,
I
care
not
which
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
to
himself
 
<EOS>
if
ever
I
insult
this
worthy
soul
more
!
    
<EOS>
the
draw
-
bridge
be
hold
irreparable
,
Trim
be
order
directly
to
set
about
another
 
but
not
upon
the
same
model
:
 
for
cardinal
Alberoni
's
intrigue
at
that
time
be
discover
,
and
my
uncle
Toby
rightly
foresee
that
a
flame
would
inevitably
break
out
betwixt
Spain
and
the
Empire
,
and
that
the
operation
of
the
ensue
campaign
must
in
all
likelihood
be
either
in
Naples
or
Sicily
 
he
determine
upon
an
italian
bridge
 
(
my
uncle
Toby
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
be
not
far
out
of
his
conjecture
)
  
but
my
father
,
who
be
infinitely
the
well
politician
,
and
take
the
lead
as
far
of
my
uncle
Toby
in
the
cabinet
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
take
it
of
him
in
the
field
 
convince
him
,
that
if
the
king
of
Spain
and
the
Emperor
go
together
by
the
ear
,
England
and
France
and
Holland
must
,
by
force
of
their
pre
-
engagement
,
all
enter
the
list
too
;
 
and
if
so
,
he
would
say
,
the
combatant
,
brother
Toby
,
<EOS>
as
sure
as
we
be
alive
,
will
fall
to
it
again
,
pell
-
mell
,
upon
the
old
prize
-
fight
stage
of
flander
;
 
then
what
will
you
do
with
your
italian
bridge
?
    
<EOS>
We
will
go
on
with
it
then
upon
the
old
model
,
cry
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
when
corporal
Trim
have
about
half
finish
it
in
that
style
 
my
uncle
Toby
find
out
a
capital
defect
in
it
,
which
he
have
never
thoroughly
consider
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
turn
,
it
seem
,
upon
hinge
at
both
end
of
it
,
open
in
the
middle
,
one
half
of
which
turn
to
one
side
of
the
fosse
,
and
the
other
to
the
other
;
the
advantage
of
which
be
this
,
that
by
divide
the
weight
of
the
bridge
into
two
equal
portion
,
it
impowere
my
uncle
Toby
to
raise
it
up
or
let
it
down
with
the
end
of
his
crutch
,
and
with
one
hand
,
which
,
as
his
garrison
be
weak
,
be
as
much
as
he
could
well
spare
 
but
the
disadvantage
of
such
a
construction
be
insurmountable
;
 
for
by
this
means
,
he
would
say
,
I
leave
one
half
of
my
bridge
in
my
enemy
's
possession
 
and
pray
of
what
use
be
the
other
?
  
<EOS>
the
natural
remedy
for
this
be
,
no
doubt
,
to
have
his
bridge
fast
only
at
one
end
with
hinge
,
so
that
the
whole
may
be
lift
up
together
,
and
stand
bolt
upright
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
reject
for
the
reason
give
above
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
whole
week
after
he
be
determine
in
his
mind
to
have
one
of
that
particular
construction
which
be
make
to

after

so
that
you
see

there
be
but
a
mark
between
these
two

as
fine
almost
as

my

be
always
either

on
that
of

and
would
often
say
,
he
believe
in
his

he
could
as
soon
hit
the
longitude

for
this
reason
,
when
he
sit
down

chair

he
draw
the
curtain
a
little
forwards
,
and
have
a

pull'd
out

that

have
the
happiness
of
read
the
oddest
book
in
the
universe

have
moreover
,
in
himself
,
the
odd
way
of
think
that

man

bless'd
with

yet
it
have
this
drawback
upon
him
after
all
 
that
it
lay
him
open
to
some
of
the
oddest
and
most
whimsical
distress
;
of
which
this
particular
one
,
which
he
sink
under
at

be
as
strong
an
example
as
can
be
give

<EOS>
no
doubt
,
the
breaking
down
of
the
bridge
of
a
child
's
nose
,
by
the
edge
of
a
pair
of
forceps
 
however
scientifically
apply
 
would
vex
any
man

who
be
at
so
much
pain

my

yet
it
will
not
account
for
the
extravagance
of
his
affliction

nor
will
it
justify
the
un

christian
manner
he
abandon
and
surrender
himself
up
to
.
  
<EOS>
to
explain
this
,
I
must
leave
him
upon

half
an
hour

my

Toby
in
his
old
fringed

sit

I

twist
up
the
paper

throw
it
upon

<EOS>
now
before

venture

make
use
of

Nose
a
second
time
 
to
avoid
all
confusion
in
what
will
be

upon
it

in
this
interesting
part

it
may
not
be
amiss
to
explain
my

define
,
with
all
possible
exactness
and
precision
,
what
I
would
willingly
be
understand
to
mean
by
the
term
:
 
be
of
opinion
,
that
'
tis
owe
to
the
negligence
and
perverseness
of
writer
in
despise
this
precaution
,
and
to
nothing
else
  
that
all
the
polemical
writing
in
divinity
be
not

clear

demonstrative
as
those
upon

the
Wisp

to
do

before

set
out

you
intend

go
puzzle
on

the
day
of
judgment

to
give
the

a
good

to
it

of
the
main
word
you

it

tradition

be
every

so
that
the
whimsicality
of
my

brain
be
far
from

the
whole
honour
of
this

as
it
have
of
almost
all
his

strange

in
a
great
measure
he
may
be
say
to
have
suck'd
<EOS>
this
in

his

<EOS>
He
do
his

however

<EOS>
if
education
plant
the
mistake
(
in
case
it
be
one
)
<EOS>
my
father
water
it
,
and
ripen
it
to
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
often
declare
,
in
speak
his
thought
upon
the
subject
,
that
he
do
not
conceive
how
the
great
family
in
England
could
stand
it
out
against
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
six
or
seven
short
nose
.
 
<EOS>
and
for
the
contrary
reason
,
he
would
generally
add
,
that
it
must
be
one
of
the
great
problem
in
civil
life
,
where
the
same
number
of
long
and
jolly
nose
,
follow
one
another
in
a
direct
line
,
do
not
raise
and
hoist
it
up
into
the
good
vacancy
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
often
boast
that
the
Shandy
family
rank'd
very
high
in
king
Harry
the
VIIIth
's
time
,
but
owe
its
rise
to
no
state
engine
 
he
would
say
 
but
to
that
only
;
 
but
that
,
like
other
family
,
he
would
add
 
it
have
feel
the
turn
of
the
wheel
,
and
have
never
recover
the
blow
of
my
great
-
grandfather
's
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
ace
of
club
indeed
,
he
would
cry
,
shake
his

as
vile
a
one
for
an
unfortunate

I

It

that

form'd
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
now

my

I
tell

detest
all

He
pick'd
up
an
opinion
,
Sir

as
a
man
in

pick
up
an
apple
.
 
<EOS>
It
become
his

<EOS>
and
if
he
be
a

he
would
lose
his

rather
than
give
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
aware
that
Didius
,
the
great
civilian

will
contest
this
point
;
and
cry
out
against
me
<EOS>
,
Whence
come
this
man

right

this
apple

<EOS>
ex

he
will

thing
be
in

<EOS>
the

be
as
much
Frank

apple
as
John

<EOS>
Pray
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
what
patent
have
he
to
shew
for
it
?
<EOS>
and
how
do
it
begin
to
be
his
?
<EOS>
be
it
,
when
he
set
his
heart
upon
it
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
gather
it
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
<EOS>
chew'd
it
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
roast
it
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
peel'd
,
or
when
he
bring
it
home
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
digest
?
 
<EOS>
or
when
he
 
?
 
<EOS>
for
'
tis
plain
,
Sir
,
if
the
first
picking
up
of
the
apple
,
make
it
not
his
 
that
no
subsequent
act
could
.
  
<EOS>
Brother
Didius
,
Tribonius
will
answer
 
<EOS>
(
now
Tribonius
the
civilian

church
lawyer
's
beard
be
three
inch

eighth

I
be
glad
he
take
up
the

for
me

so
I
give
myself
no

trouble
about
the
answer
.
)
 
<EOS>
Brother
Didius
,
Tribonius
will
say
,
it
be
a
decreed
case
,
as
you
may
find
it
in
the
fragment
of
Gregorius
and
Hermogines
's
code
,
and
in
all
the
code
from
Justinian
be
down
to
the
code
of
Louis
and
Des
Eaux
 
that
the
sweat
of
a
man
's
brow
,
and
the
exsudation
of
a
man
's
brain
,
be
as
much
a
man
's
own
property
as
the
breech
upon
his
backside
;
 
which
say
exsudation
,
&
c.
be
dropp'd
<EOS>
upon
the
say
apple
by
the
labour
of
find
it
,
and
pick
it
up
;
and
be
moreover
indissolubly
waste
,
and
as
indissolubly
annex'd
,
by
the
picker
up
,
to
the
thing
pick'd
up
,
carry
home
,
roast
,
peel'd
,
eat
,
digested
,
and
so
on
;
 
'
tis
evident
that
the
gatherer
of
the
apple
,
in
so
do
,
have
mix'd
up
something
which
be
his
own
,
with
the
apple
which
be
not
his
own
,
by
which
mean
he
have
acquire
a
property
;
 
or
,
in
other
word
,
the
apple
be
John
's
apple
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
same
learned
chain
of
reason
my
father
stand
up
for
all
his
opinion
;
he
have
spare
no
pain
in
pick
them
up
,
and
the
more
they
lie
out
of
the
common
way
,
the
well
still
be
his
title
.
 
<EOS>
no
mortal
claim
them
;
they
have
cost
him
moreover
as
much
labour
in
cooking
and
digest
as
in
the
case
above
,
so
that
they
may
well
and
truly
be
say
to
be
of
his
own
good
and
chattel
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
he
hold
fast
by
'em
,
both
by
tooth
and
claws
 
would
fly
to
whatever
he
could
lay
his
hand
on
 
and
,
in
a
word
,
would
intrench
and
fortify
them
round
with
as
many
circumvallation
and
breast
-
work
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
would
a
citadel
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
plaguy
rub
in
the
way
of
this
 
the
scarcity
of
material
to
make
any
thing
of
a
defence
with
,
in
case
of
a
smart
attack
;
inasmuch
as
few
man
of
great
genius
have
exercise
their
part
in
write
book
upon
the
subject
of
great
nose
:
 
by
the
trotting
of
my
lean
horse
,
the
thing
be
incredible
!
<EOS>
and
I
be
quite
lose
in
my
understanding
,
when
I
be
consider
what
a
treasure
of
precious
time
and
talent
together
have
be
waste
upon
bad
subject
 
and
<EOS>
how
many
million

book

all

in
all
possible
type

have
be
fabricate
upon

not

<EOS>
what
be

however

My

<EOS>
Slawkenbergius
be
play'd
upon

for

of

for
in
the
account
which
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
give
the

of

motive
and
occasion
for
writing
,
and
spend
so
many
year
of
his
life
upon
this
one
work
 
towards
the
end
of
his
prolegomena
,
which
by
-
the

bye
should
have
come
first
 
but
the
bookbinder
have
most
injudiciously
place
it
betwixt
the
analytical
content
of
the
book
,
and
the
book
itself
 
he
inform
his
reader
,
that
ever
since
he
have
arrive
at
the
age
of
discernment
,
and
be
able
to
sit
down
cooly
,
and
consider
within
himself
the
true
state
and
condition
of
man
,
and
distinguish
the
main
end
and
design
of
his
being
;
 
or
 
to
shorten
my
translation
,
for
Slawkenbergius
's
book
be
in
Latin
,
and
not
a
little
prolix
in
this
passage
 
ever
since
I
understand
,
quoth
Slawkenbergius
,
any
thing
 
or
rather
what
be
what
 
and
could
perceive
that
the
point
of
long
nose
have
be
too
loosely
handle
by
all
who
have
go
before
;
 
have
I
Slawkenbergius
,
feel
a
strong
impulse
,
with
a
mighty
and
unresistible
call
within
me
,
to
gird
up
myself
to
this
undertaking
.
  
<EOS>
and
to
do
justice
to
Slawkenbergius
,
he
have
enter
the
list
with
a
strong
lance
,
and
take
a
much
large
career
in
it
than
any
one
man
who
have
ever
enter
it
before
him
 
and
indeed
,
in
many
respect
,
deserve
to
be
en

nich'd
as
a
prototype
for
all
writer
,
of
voluminous
work
at
least
,
to
model
their
book
by
 
for
he
have
take
in
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
the
whole
subject
  
examine
every
part
of
it
dialectically
 
then
bring
it
into
full
day
;
dilucidate
it
with
all
the
light
which
either
the
collision
of
his
own
natural
part
could
strike
 
or
the
profound
knowledge
of
the
science
have
impowere
him
to
cast
upon
it
 
collating
,
collect
,
and
compile
  
begging
,
borrowing
,
and
steal
,
as
he
go
along
,
all
that
have
be
write
or
wrangle
thereupon
in
the
school
and
portico
of
the
learn
:
 
so
that
slawkenbergius
his
book
may
properly
be
consider
,
not
only
as
a
model
  
but
as
a
thorough
-
stitch
Digest
and
regular
institute
of
nose
,
comprehend
in
it
all
that
be
or
can
be
needful
to
be
know
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
cause
<EOS>
it
be
that
I
forbear
to
speak
of
so
many
(
otherwise
)
valuable
book
and
treatise
of
my
father
's
collecting
,
write
either
,
plump
upon
nose
 
or
collaterally
touch
them
;
 
such
for
instance
as
Prignitz
,
now
lie
upon
the
table
before
me
,
who
with
infinite
learning
,
and
from
the
most
candid
and
scholar
-
like
examination
of
above
four
thousand
different
skull
,
in
upwards
of
twenty
charnel
-
house
in
Silesia
,
which
he
have
rummage
 
have
inform
us
,
that
the
mensuration
and
configuration
of
the
osseous
or
bony
part
of
human
nose
,
in
any
give
tract
of
country
,
except
Crim
Tartary
,
where
they
be
all
crush'd
down
by
the
thumb
,
so
that
no
judgment
can
be
form
upon
them
 
be
much
near
alike
,
than
the
world
imago
;
 
<EOS>
the
difference
amongst
them
be
,
he
say
,
a
mere
trifle
,
not
worth
take
notice
of
;
 
but
that
the
size
and
jollity
of
every
individual
nose
,
and
by
which
one
nose
rank
above
another
,
and
bear
a
high
price
,
be
owe
to
the
cartilaginous
and
muscular
part
of
it
,
into
whose
duct
and
sinuse
the
blood
and
animal
spirit
be
impell'd
and
drive
by
the
warmth
and
force
of
the
imagination
,
which
be
but
a
step
from
it
(
bate
the
case
of
idiot
,
whom
Prignitz
,
who
have
live
many
year
in
Turky
,
suppose
under
the
more
immediate
tutelage
of
Heaven
)
 
<EOS>
it
so
happen
,
and
ever
must
,
say
Prignitz
,
that
the
excellency
of
the
nose
be
in
a
direct
arithmetical
proportion
to
the
excellency
of
the
wearer
's
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
for
the
same
reason
,
that
is
,
because
'
tis
all
comprehend
in
Slawkenbergius
,
that
I
say
nothing
likewise
of
Scroderus
(
Andrea
)
who
,
all
the
world
know
,
set
himself
to
oppugn
Prignitz
with
great
violence
  
prove
it
in
his
own
way
,
first
logically
,
and
then
by
a
series
of
stubborn
fact
,
"
that
so
far
be
Prignitz
from
the
truth
,
in
affirm
that
the
fancy
begat
the
nose
,
that
on
the
contrary
 
the
nose
beget
the
fancy
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
learn
suspect
Scroderus
of
an
indecent
sophism
in
this
 
and
Prignitz
cry
out
aloud
in
the
dispute
,
that
Scroderus
have
shift
the
idea
upon
him
 
but
Scroderus
go
on
,
maintain
his
thesis
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
just
balance
within
himself
,
which
of
the
two
side
he
should
take
in
this
affair
;
when
Ambrose
Paraeus
decide
it
in
a
moment
,
and
by
overthrow
the
system
,
both
of
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
,
drive
my
father
out
of
both
side
of
the
controversy
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
be
witness
    
<EOS>
I
do
not
acquaint
the
learn
reader
 
in
say
it
<EOS>
,
I
mention
it
only
to
shew
the
learn
,
I
know
the
fact
myself
    
that
this
Ambrose
Paraeus
be
chief
surgeon
and
nose
-
mender
to
Francis
the
ninth
of
France
,
and
in
high
credit
with
him
and
the
two
precede
,
or
succeed
king
(
I
know
not
which
)
 
and
that
,
except
in
the
slip
he
make
in
his
story
of
Taliacotius
's
nose
,
and
his
manner
of
set
them
on
 
he
be
esteem
by
the
whole
college
of
physician
at
that
time
,
as
more
know
in
matter
of
nose
,
than
any
one
who
have
ever
take
them
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
now
Ambrose
Paraeus
convince
my
father
,
that
the
true
and
efficient
cause
of
what
have
engage
so
much
the
attention
of
the
world
,
and
upon
which
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
have
waste
so
much
learning
and
fine
part
 
be
neither
this
nor
that
 
but
that
the
length
and
goodness
of
the
nose
be
owe
simply
to
the
softness
and
flaccidity
in
the
nurse
's
breast
 
as
the
flatness
and
shortness
of
puisne
nose
be
to
the
firmness
and
elastic
repulsion
of
the
same
organ
of
nutrition
in
the
hale
and
lively
 
<EOS>
which
,
tho
'
happy
for
the
woman
,
be
the
undoing
of
the
child
,
inasmuch
as
his
nose
be
so
snubb'd
,
so
rebuff'd
,
so
rebate
,
and
so
refrigerated
thereby
,
as
never
to
arrive
ad
mensuram
suam
legitimam
;
 
but
<EOS>
that
in
case
of
the
flaccidity
and
softness
of
the
nurse
or
mother
's
breast
 
by
sink
into
it
,
quoth
Paraeus
,
as
into
so
much
butter
,
the
nose
be
comfort
,
nourish'd
,
plump'd
up
,
refresh'd
,
refocillate
,
and
set
a
growing
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
but
two
thing
to
observe
of
Paraeus
;
first
,
that
he
prove
and
explain
all
this
with
the
utmost
chastity
and
decorum
of
expression
:
 
for
which
may
his
soul
for
ever
rest
in
peace
!
  
<EOS>
and
,
secondly
,
that
besides
the
system
of
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
,
which
Ambrose
Paraeus
<EOS>
his
hypothesis
effectually
overthrow
 
<EOS>
it
overthrow
at
the
same
time
the
system
of
peace
and
harmony
of
our
family
;
and
for
three
day
together
,
not
only
embroil
matter
between
my
father
and
my
mother
,
but
turn'd
<EOS>
likewise
the
whole
house
and
every
thing
in
it
,
except
my
uncle
Toby
,
quite
upside
down
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
ridiculous
tale
of
a
dispute
between
a
man
and
his
wife
,
never
surely
in
any
age
or
country
get
vent
through
the
key
-

of

<EOS>
My

you

this

the
more
solemn
 
that
I
believe
in

partiality
to

)
<EOS>
the
hand
of
the
supreme
Maker

first
designer
of
all
thing
never
make
or
put
a
family
together
(
in
that
period
at
least
of
it
which
I
have
sit
down
to
write
the
story
of
)
 
where
the
character
of
it
be
cast
or
contrast
with
so
dramatick
a
felicity
as
our
be

for
this

in

the
capacity
of
afford
such
exquisite
scene

the
power
of
shift
them
perpetually
from
morning

night
,
be
lodge

intrust

so
unlimited
a
confidence
,
as
in
the
Shandy

<EOS>
not
any
one
of
these
be
more
diverting
,
I
say
,
in
this
whimsical
theatre
of
our
 
than
what
frequently
arise
out
of
this
self
-
same
chapter
of
long
nose
 
especially
when
my

's
imagination
be
heat
with
the
enquiry
,
and
nothing
would
serve
him
but
to
heat
my
uncle
Toby
be
too
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
would
give
my
father
all
possible
fair
play
in
this
attempt
;
and
with
infinite
patience
would
sit
smoke
his
pipe
for
whole
hour
together
,
whilst
my
father
be
practise
upon
his
head
,
and
try
every
accessible
avenue
to
drive
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
's
solution
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
whether
they
be
above
my
uncle
Toby
's
reason
 
or
contrary
to
it
 
or
that
his
brain
be
like
damp
timber
,
and
no
spark
could
possibly
take
hold
 
or
that
it
be
so
full
of
sap
,
mine
,
blind
,
curtin
,
and
such
military
disqualification
to
his
see
clearly
into
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
's
doctrine
 
<EOS>
I
say
not
 
let
schoolman
 
scullion
,
anatomist
,
and
engineer
,
fight
for
it
among
themselves
    
<EOS>
@@@Twas
some
misfortune
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
in
this
affair
,
that
my
father
have
every
word
of
it
to
translate
for
the
benefit
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
render
out
of
Slawkenbergius
's
Latin
,
of
which
,
as
he
be
no
great
master
,
his
translation
be
not
always
of
the
pure
 
and
generally
least
so
where
'
twas
most
want

<EOS>
this
<EOS>
naturally
open'd
a
door
to
a
second
misfortune
;
  
that
in
the
warm
paroxysm
of
his
zeal
to
open
my
uncle
Toby
's
eye
 
my

's
idea
run

the
translation

the

<EOS>
my

Toby
's
 
neither

with

through

ever
happen

<EOS>
there
be
a
few
of
them
in
his
eighth

ninth
,
and
tenth
decad
,
which
I
own
seem
rather
playful
and
sportive
,
than
speculative
 
<EOS>
but
in
general
they
be
to
be
look
upon
by
the
learn
as
a
detail
of
so
many
independent
fact
,
all
of
them
turn
round
somehow
or
other
upon
the
main
hinge
of
his
subject

add
to
his
work
as
so
many
illustration

It

evening
,
at
the
close
of
a
very
sultry
day
,
in
the
latter
end
of
the
month
of
August
,
when
a
stranger
,
mount
upon
a
dark
mule
,
with
a
small
cloak
-
bag
behind
him
,
contain
a
few
shirt
,
a
pair
of
shoe
,
and
a
crimson

sattin
pair
of
breech
,
enter

<EOS>
He
tell
the

he
never

such
a
Nose
in
his
life

<EOS>
I
have
make
a
very
good
venture
of
it
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
stranger

so
slip
his
wrist
out
of
the
loop
of
a
black
ribbon
,
to
which
a
short
scymetar
be
hang
,
he
put
his
hand
into

with
great
courtesy
touch

fore
part

his
left
hand

right
 
<EOS>

put
a
florin
into

dwarfish
bandy-
<EOS>
legg'd
drummer
,
that
so
courteous
a
soul
should
have
lose
his
scabbard
 
he
can
not
travel

one
to
his
scymetar

will
not

get
a

to
fit
it
in
all
Strasburg
.
 
<EOS>
I
never

effect
which
nutriment

imaginable

in
the
triumph
of
which
theory

they
go
so
far
as
to
affirm
,
that
there
be
no
cause
in
nature

why
a
nose
may
not
grow
to
the
size

<EOS>
this

never

them
so
long
as
a

have

one
stomach

one

of
lung
 
<EOS>
for
the
stomach
,
say
they
,
be
the
only
organ
destine
for
the
reception
of
food
,
and
turn
it
into
chyle
 
and
the
lung
the
only
engine
of
sanguification
 
it
could
possibly
work
off
no
more

than
what
the
appetite
bring
it

admit
the
possibility
of
a

's
overload
his

nature
have
set
bound
however
to
his

<EOS>
the
engine
be
of
a
determined
size

strength
,
and
could
elaborate
but
a
certain
quantity
in
a
give
time
 
that
is
,
it
could
produce
just
as
much
blood
as
be
sufficient
for
one
single

no
more
;
so
that
,
if
there
be
as
much
nose
as
man
 
<EOS>
they
prove
a
mortification
must
necessarily
ensue
;
and
forasmuch
as
there
could
not
be
a
support
for
both
,
that
the
nose
must
either
fall
off
from
the
man
,
or
the
man
inevitably
fall
off
from
his
nose
.
  
<EOS>
nature
accommodate
herself
to
these
emergency
,
cry
the
opponent
 
else
what
do
you
say
to
the
case
of
a
whole
stomach
 
a
whole
pair
of

<EOS>

half

die

It
ought
not

say
they
.
  
<EOS>
the
more
curious
and
intimate
inquirer
after
nature
and
her
doing
,
though
they
go
hand
in
hand
a
good
way
together
,
yet
they
all
divide
about
the
nose
at
last
,
almost
as
much
as
the
Faculty
itself
  
<EOS>
They
amicably
lay
it
down
,
that
there
be
a
just
and
geometrical
arrangement
and
proportion
of
the
several
part
of
the
human
frame
to
its
several
destination
,
office
,
and
function
,
which
could
not
be
transgress
but
within
certain
limit
 
<EOS>
that
nature
,
though
she
sport
  
she
sport
within
a
certain
circle
;
 
and
they
could
not
agree
about
the
diameter
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
logicians
stick
much
closer
to
the
point
before
them
than
any
of
the
class
of
the
literati
;
 
they
begin
and
end
with
the
word
Nose
;
and
have
it
not
be
for
a
petitio
principii
,
which
one
of
the
ablest
of
them
run
his
head
against
in
the
beginning
of
the
combat
,
the
whole
controversy
have
be
settle
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
a
nose
,
argue
the
logician
,
can
not
bleed
without
blood
 
and
not
only
blood
 
but
blood
circulate
in
it
to
supply
the
phaenomenon
with
a
succession
of
drop
 
(
a
stream
being
but
a
quick
succession
of
drop
,
that
be
include
,
say
he
.
)
 
<EOS>
now
death
,
continue
the
logician
,
be
nothing
but
the
stagnation
of
the
blood
    
<EOS>
I
deny
the
definition
 
<EOS>
death
be
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
,
say
his
antagonist
 
<EOS>
then
we
do
not
agree
about
our
weapon
,
say
the
logician
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
an
end
of
the
dispute
,
reply
the
antagonist
.
  
<EOS>
the
civilian
be
still
more
concise
:
 
what
they
offer
be
more
in
the
nature
of
a
decree
 
than
a
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
monstrous
nose
,
say
they
,
have
it
be
a
true
nose
,
could
not
possibly
have
be
suffer
in
civil
society
 
and
if
false
 
to
impose
upon
society
with
such
false
sign
and
token
,
be
a
still
great
violation
of
its
right
,
and
must
have
have
still
less
mercy
shew
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
objection
to
this
be
,
that
if
it
prove
any
thing
,
it
prove
the
stranger
's
nose
be
neither
true
nor
false
.
  
<EOS>
this
left
room
for
the
controversy
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
maintain
by
the
advocate
of
the
ecclesiastic
court
,
that
there
be
nothing
to
inhibit
a
decree
,
since
the
strange
ex
mero
motu
have
confess
he
have
be
at
the
Promontory
of
Noses
,
and
have
get
one
of
the
goodly
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
<EOS>
to
this
it
be
answer
,
it
be
impossible
there
should
be
such
a
place
as
the
Promontory
of
Noses
,
and
the
learn
be
ignorant
where
it
lie
.
 
<EOS>
the
commissary
of
the
bishop
of
Strasburg
undertake
the
advocate
,
explain
this
matter
in
a
treatise
upon
proverbial
phrase
,
shew
them
,
that
the
Promontory
of
Noses
be
a
mere
allegorick
expression
,
import
no
more
than
that
nature
have
give
him
a
long
nose
:

proof
of
which

with
great
learning

he

from

be

manner

as
it
appear
from

register

county

that
Luther
be
not
bear
in

you

he
would
say

look
up

"
that
christian
name

not
such
indifferent
thing

have
Luther
here
be
call
by
any

Martin

he
would
have
be
damn'd

that
I
look

he
would

tis
something
well

a
neutral

but
a
little

little
as
it
be
you
see
it
be
of
some
service
to
him

My

know
the
weakness
of
this
prop
to
his
hypothesis

as
well
as
the
good
logician
could
shew
him
 
yet
so
strange
be
the

man

as
it
fall
in
his

he
could
not
for
his

make
use
of
it

it
be
certainly
for
this
reason

though
there

many

o

<EOS>
the
line

very
natural
 
<EOS>
for
they
be
nothing

say
Slawkenbergius

there

be

they

sally
forth

@@@ti
needless
to
inform
the
geographical
reader
,
that
when
Diego
be
in
Spain
,
it
be
not
possible
to
meet
the
courteous
stranger
in
the
Frankfort
road
;
it

enough
to

,
that
of
all
restless
desire

curiosity
be
the
strong
 
<EOS>
the
Strasburgers
feel
the

of
it

that
for

they
be
toss

fro
in

with
the
tempestuous
fury

I

in

word

say
Slawkenbergius

give

well

deem
it
a

their

the
fate

of

They

it

avoid
 
for

in

the

My

lie
stretch
across

the

push
him
down

for

play
upon

My

answer
it

full

would
have
ingraft
a

of
consolation
upon
the
opening
it
afford
:
 
but
have
no
talent
,
as
I
say
,
that
way
,
and
fear
moreover
that
he
may
set
out
with
something
which
may
make
a

bad

content
himself
with
rest
his

now
whether
the

shorten

emerge
out

the

have
brace
up
his

so
that
the
compression
upon

only
double
the
benignity

be
there

decide

I
have
leave
trim
my
bowling

green

cry
my

Toby
 
<EOS>
My

smile
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
leave
him
moreover
a
pension
,
continue
my

Toby

<EOS>
My

look
grave

<EOS>
be
this
a
fit
time
,
say
my
father
to
himself
,
to
talk
of
Pensions
and
Grenadiers
?
    
<EOS>
when
my
uncle
Toby
first
mention
the
grenadier
,
my
father
,
I
say
,
fall
down
with
his
nose
flat
to
the
quilt
,
and
as
suddenly
as
if
my
uncle
Toby
have
shoot
him
;
but
it
be
not
add
that
every
other
limb
and
member
of
my
father
instantly
relapse
with
his
nose
into
the
same
precise
attitude
in
which
he
lie
first
describe
;
so
that
when
corporal
Trim
leave
the
room
,
and
my
father
find
himself
disposed
to
rise
off
the
bed
 
<EOS>
he
have
all
the
little
preparatory
movement
to
run
over
again
,
before
he
could
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
attitude
be
nothing
,
madam
 
'
<EOS>
tis
the
transition
from
one
attitude
to
another
 
like
the
preparation
and
resolution
of
the
discord
into
harmony
,
which
be
all
in
all
.
  
<EOS>
for
which
reason
my

play
the

jig
over
again
with
his
toe
upon
the
floor
 
push
the
chamber
-
pot
still
a
little
farther
within
the
valance
 
give
a

raise
himself
up
upon
his

and
be
just
begin
to
address
himself
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
when
recollect
the
unsuccessfulness
of
his
first
effort
in
that
attitude
 
he
get
upon
his
leg
,
and
in
make
the
third
turn
across
the
room
,
he
stop
short
before
my
uncle
Toby
;
and
lay
the
three
first
finger
of
his
right

hand
in
the
palm
of
his
left

and
stoop
a
little
,
he
address
himself
to
my
uncle
Toby
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
when
I
reflect
,
brother
Toby
,
upon
man
;
and
take
a
view
of
that
dark
side
of
him
which
represent
his
life
as
open
to
so
many
cause
of
trouble
 
when
I
consider
,
brother
Toby
,
how
oft
we
eat
the
bread
of
affliction
,
and
that
we
be
bear
to
it
,
as
to
the
portion
of
our
inheritance
 
<EOS>
I
be
bear
to
nothing
,
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my

Toby

interrupt
my

but
my
commission
.
 
<EOS>
Zooks

<EOS>
say
my

,
do
not
my

leave
you
a
hundred

twenty
pound
a

<EOS>
what
could
I
have
do
without
it
?
<EOS>
reply
my
uncle
Toby
  
<EOS>
that
be
another
concern
,
say
my
father
testily
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
Toby
,
when
one
run
over
the
catalogue
of
all
the
cross
-
reckoning
and
sorrowful
item
with
which
the
heart
of

<EOS>
tis
wonderful
by
what

resource
<EOS>
the

be
enable
to
stand
out
,
and
bear
itself
up
,
as
it
do
,
against
the
imposition
lay
upon
our
nature
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
by
the
assistance
of
Almighty
God
,
cry
my
uncle
Toby
,
look
up
,
and
press
the
palm
of
his
hand
close
together
 
'
tis
not
from
our
own
strength
,
brother
Shandy
 
<EOS>
a
centinel
in
a
wooden
centry
-
box
might
as
well
pretend
to
stand
it
out
against

<EOS>
We

<EOS>
that
be
cut

say
my

,
instead

untie
it

but
give
me
leave
to
lead
you
,
brother
Toby
,
a
little
deep
into
the
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
my
heart
,
reply
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
instantly
exchange
the
attitude
he
be
in
,
for
that
in
which
Socrates
be
so
finely
paint
by
Raffael
in
his
school
of
Athens
;
which
your
connoisseurship
know
be
so
exquisitely
imagine
,
that
even
the
particular
manner
of
the
reasoning
of
Socrates
be
express
by
it
 
for
he
hold
the
fore
-
finger
of
his
left
-
hand
between
the
fore
-
finger
and
the
thumb
of
his
right
,
and
seem
as
if
he
be
say
to
the
libertine
he
be
reclaim
 
<EOS>
"
You
grant
me
this
 
<EOS>
and
this

this

<EOS>
and
this

I
do
not
ask
of
you
 
<EOS>
they
follow
of
themselves
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
stand
my
father
,
hold
fast
his
fore
-
finger
betwixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
,
and
reason
with
my
uncle
Toby
as
he
sit
in
his
old
fringed
chair
,
valance
around
with
party
-
colour
worst

<EOS>
o

<EOS>
what
a

scene

thy

<EOS>
and
how
gladly
would
I
write
such
another
to

myself
of
thy

secure
my

it

<EOS>
though
man
be
of
all
other
the
most
curious
vehicle
,
say
my
father
,
yet
at
the
same
time
'
tis
of
so
slight
a
frame
,
and
so
totteringly
put
together
,
that
the
sudden
jerk
and
hard
jostling
<EOS>
it
unavoidably
meet
with
in
this
rugged

,
would
overset
and
tear
it
to
piece
<EOS>
a
dozen
time
a
day
 
be
it
not
,
brother
Toby
,
that
there
be
a
secret
spring
within
us
.
 
<EOS>
which
spring
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
take
to
be
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Will
that
set
my
child
's
nose
on
?
<EOS>
cry
my
father
,
let
go
his
finger
,
and
strike
one
hand
against
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
every
thing
straight
for
us
,
answer
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
figuratively
speak
,
dear
Toby
,
it
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
say
my
father
;
but
the
spring
I
be
speak
of
,
be
that
great
and
elastic
power
within
us
of
counterbalance
evil
,
which
,
like
a
secret
spring
in
a
well
-
order
machine
,
though
it
can
not
prevent
the
shock
 
at
least
it
impose
upon
our
sense
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
brother
,
say
my
father
,
replace
his
fore
-
finger
,
as
he
be
come
closer
to
the
point
 
<EOS>
have
my
child
arrive
safe
into
the
world
,
<EOS>
unmartyr'd
in
that
precious
part
of
him
 
fanciful
and
extravagant
as
I
may
appear
to
the
world
in
my
opinion
of
christian
name
,
and
of
that
magic
bias
which
good
or
bad
name
irresistibly
impress
upon
our
character
and
conduct
 
Heaven
be
witness
!
<EOS>
that
in
the
warm
transport
of
my
wish
for
the
prosperity
of
my
child
,
I
never
once
wish
to
crown
his
head
with
more
glory
and
honour
than
what
George
or
Edward
would
have
spread
around
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
continue
my
father
,
as
the
great
evil
have
befall
him
 
<EOS>
I
must
counteract
and
undo
it
with
the
great
good
.
  
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
I
wish
it
may
answer
 
<EOS>
reply
my

Toby
,
rise
up

<EOS>
what
a
chapter
of
chance
,
say
my

,
turn
himself
about
upon
the
first
landing
,
as
he
and
my

Toby
be
go
down

what
a
long
chapter
of

do
the
event
of
this

lie
open
to
us
!
 
<EOS>
take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
,
brother
Toby
,
and
calculate
it
fairly
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
of
calculation
than
this
balluster
,
say
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
(
strike
short
of
it
with
his
crutch
,
and
hit
my
father
a
desperate
blow
souse
upon
his
shin

bone
)
 
'
Twas
a
hundred
to
one
-
cry
my

<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
(
rub
his
shin
)
<EOS>
you
have
know
nothing
of
calculation
,
brother
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
a
mere
chance
<EOS>
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
add
one
to
the
chapter
 
reply
my

.
  
<EOS>
the
double
success
of
my

's
repartee
tickle
off
the
pain
of
his
shin
at
once
 
<EOS>
it
be
well
<EOS>
it
so
fall
out
 
(
chance
!
<EOS>
again
)
 
or
the
world
to
this
day
have
never
know
the
subject
of
my
father
's
calculation
 
to
guess
it
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
chance
 
<EOS>
what
a
lucky
chapter
of
chance
have
this
turn
out
!
<EOS>
for
it
have
save
me
the
trouble
of
write
one
express
,
and
in
truth
I
have
enough
already
upon
my
hand
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
have
not
I
promise
the
world
a
chapter
of
knot
?
<EOS>
two
chapter
upon
the
right
and
the
wrong
end
of
a
woman
?
<EOS>
a
chapter
upon
whisker
?
<EOS>
a
chapter
upon
wish
?
 
<EOS>
a
chapter
of
nose
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
have
do
that
 
a
chapter
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
modesty
?
<EOS>
to
say
nothing
of
a
chapter
upon
chapter
,
which
I
will
finish
before
I
sleep
 
by
my
great
grandfather
's
whisker
,
I
shall
never
get
half
of
'em
through
this
year
.
  
<EOS>
take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
,
and
calculate
it
fairly
,
brother
Toby
,
say
my
father
,
and
it
will
turn
out
a
million
to
one
,
that
of
all
the
part
of
the
body
,
the
edge
of
the
forceps
should
have
the
ill
luck
just
to
fall
upon
and
break
down
that
one
part
,
which
should
break
down
the
fortune
of
our
house
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
bad
,
reply
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
comprehend
,
say
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
suppose
the
hip
have
present
,
reply
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
Dr.
Slop
forebode
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
reflect
half
a
minute
 
look
down
 
touch
the
middle
of
his
forehead
slightly
with
his
finger
      
True
,
say
he
.
    
<EOS>
be
it
not
a
shame
to
make
two
chapter
of
what
pass
in
go
down
one
pair
of
stair
?
<EOS>
for
we
be
get
no
farther
yet
than
to
the
first
landing
,
and
there
be
fifteen
more
step
down
to
the
bottom
;
and
for
aught
I
know
,
as
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
be
in
a
talk
humour
,
there
may
be
as
many
chapter
as
step
:
 
<EOS>
let
that
be
as
it
will
,
Sir
,
I
can
no
more
help
it
than
my
destiny
:
 
<EOS>
a
sudden
impulse
come
across
me
 
<EOS>
drop
the
curtain
<EOS>
,
Shandy
 
I
drop
it
 
strike
a
line
here
across
the
paper
,
Tristram
 
I
strike
it
 
<EOS>
and
hey
for
a
new
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
the
deuce
of
any
other
rule
have
I
to
govern
myself
by
in
this
affair
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
have
one
 
as
I
do
all
thing
out
of
all
rule
 
I
would
twist
it
and
tear
it
to
piece
,
and
throw
it
into
the
fire
when
I
have
do
 
<EOS>
be
I
warm
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
and
the
cause
demand
it
 
a
pretty
story
!
<EOS>
be
a
man
to
follow
rule
 
or
rule
to
follow
him
?
  
<EOS>
now
this
,
you
must
know
,
be
my
chapter
upon
chapter
,
which
I
promise
to
write
before
I
go
to
sleep
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
meet
to
ease
my
conscience
entirely
before
I
lay
down
,
by
tell
the
world
all
I
know
about
the
matter
at
once
:
 
be
not
this
ten
time
well
than
to
set
out
dogmatically
with
a
sententious
parade
of
wisdom
,
and
tell
the
world
a
story
of
a
roasted
horse
 
that
chapter
relieve
the
mind
 
that
they
assist
 
or
impose
upon
the
imagination
 
and
that
in
a
work
of
this
dramatic
cast
they
be
as
necessary
as
the
shifting
of
scene
 
with
fifty
other
cold
conceit
,
enough
to
extinguish
the
fire
which
roast
him
?
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
but
to
understand
this
,
which
be
a
puff
at
the
fire
of
Diana
's
temple
 
you
must
read
Longinus
 
<EOS>
read

you

him

read
him
again
 
Avicenna

Licetus

Aristotle

time
through

never

a

<EOS>

mark
the

<EOS>
Avicenna
turn
out

give
any

a
crown
to

me
with
his

to
get
my

my

Toby
off

to
put
them
to

'
Tis
even
high
time

for
except
a
short
nap
,
which
they
both
get
whilst
Trim
be
bore
the
jack

boot

which
,
by

the

bye
,
do
my

<EOS>
no
sort
of
good
,
upon
the
score
of
the
bad
hinge
 
they
have
not
else
shut
their
eye
,
since
nine
hour
before
the
time
that
doctor
Slop
be
lead
into
the
back
parlour
in
that
dirty
pickle
by
Obadiah

<EOS>
be
every
day
of
my
life
to
be
as
busy
a
day
as
this
 
and
to
take
up
  
truce
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
finish
that
sentence
till
I
have
make
an
observation
upon
the
strange
state
of
affair
between
the
reader
and
myself
,
just
as
thing
stand
at
present
 
an
observation
never
applicable
before
to
any
one
biographical
writer
since
the
creation
of
the
world
,
but
to
myself
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
,
will
never
hold
good
to
any
other
,
until
its
final
destruction
  
and
therefore
,
for
the
very
novelty
of
it
alone
,
it
must
be
worth
your
worship
attend
to
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
this
month
one
whole
year
old
than
I
be
this
time
twelve
-
month
;
and
have
get
,
as
you
perceive
,
almost
into
the
middle
of
my
third
volume
(
accord
to
the
precede
edition
.
)
 
<EOS>
and
no
farther
than
to
my
first
day
's
life
 
'
tis
demonstrative
that
I
have
three
hundred
and
sixty
-
four
day
more
life
to
write
just
now
,
than
when
I
first
set
out
;
so
that
instead
of
advance
,
as
a
common
writer
,
in
my
work
with
what
I
have
be
do
at
it
 
on
the
contrary
,
I
be
just
throw
so
many
volume
back
 
<EOS>
be
every
day
of
my
life
to
be
as
busy
a
day
as
this
 
<EOS>
and
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
and
the
transaction
and
opinion
of
it
to
take
up
as
much
description
 
<EOS>
and
for
what
reason
should
they
be
cut
short
?
<EOS>
as
at
this
rate
I
should
just
live
364
time
faster
than
I
should
write
 
<EOS>
It
must
follow
,
an
'
please
your
worship
,
that
the
more
I
write
,
the
more
I
shall
have
to
write
 
and
consequently
,
the
more
your
worship
read
,
the
more
your
worship
will
have
to
read
.
  
<EOS>
Will
this
be
good
for
your
worship
eye
?
  
<EOS>
It
will
do
well
for
mine
;
and
,
be
it
not
that
my
opinion
will
be
the
death
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
I
shall
lead
a
fine
life
of
it
out
of
this
self-
same
life
of
mine
;
or
,
in
other
word
,
shall
lead
a
couple
of
fine
live
together
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
proposal
of
twelve
volume
a
year
,
or
a
volume
a
month
,
it
no
way
alter
my
prospect
 
<EOS>
write
as
I
will
,
and
rush
as
I
may
into
the
middle
of
thing
,
as
horace
advise
 
I
shall
never
overtake
myself
whipp'd
and
drive
to
the
last
pinch
;
at
the
bad
I
shall
have
one
day
<EOS>
the
start
of
my
pen
 
and
one
day
be
enough
for
two
volume
 
and
two
volume
will
be
enough
for
one
year
.
    
<EOS>
Heaven
prosper
the
manufacturer
of
paper
under
this
propitious
reign
,
which
be
now
open
to
us
 
as
I
trust
its

will
prosper
every

else
in

<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
write
a
chapter
upon
sleep

<EOS>
a
fitter
occasion
could
never

present

than
what
this
moment
offer

when
all

put
out
 
and
no
creature

be
shut

twenty

<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
subject

<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
fine
as
it
be

I
would
undertake
to
write
a
dozen
chapter
upon
button

hole
,
both
quicker
and
with
more
fame
,
than
a
single
chapter
upon
this

<EOS>
button

hole
!
<EOS>
there
be
something
lively
in
the
very
idea
of
'em

trust
me
,
when
I
get
amongst
'em
 
<EOS>
You
gentry
with
great
beard
 
look
as
grave
as
you
will
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
merry
work
with
my
button

<EOS>
I
shall
have
'em
all
to
myself

tis
<EOS>
a

I
shall
run
foul
of
no
man

wisdom

fine
saying
in

<EOS>
but
for
sleep
 
I
know
I
shall
make
nothing

I
begin
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
dab
at
your
fine
saying
in
the
first
place

<EOS>
in
the
next

I
can
not
for
my
soul
set
a
grave
face
upon
a
bad
matter
,
and
tell
the
world
 
'
tis
the
refuge
of
the
unfortunate
 
the
enfranchisement
of
the
prisoner
 
the
downy
lap
of
the
hopeless
,
the
weary
,
and
the
break

hearted
;
nor
could
I
set
out
with
a
lye
in
my
mouth
,
by
affirm
,
that
of
all
the
soft
and
delicious
function
of
our
nature

by
which
the
great
author
of

in
his
bounty

have
be
please
to
recompence
the
suffering
wherewith
his
justice

his
good
pleasure
have
weary
us
 
that
this
be
the
chief
(
I
know
pleasure
worth
ten
of
it

;
or
what
a
happiness
it
be
to
man
,
when
the
anxiety

<EOS>
now
there
be
more
to
me
in
this

and
it
speak
warm
to
my
heart
and
affection
,
than
all
the
dissertation
squeez'd
out
of
the

of
the

upon
the

<EOS>
not
that
I
altogether
disapprove
of
what
Montaigne
advance
upon
it

tis
admirable
in
its

(
I
quote
by

<EOS>
the

enjoy
other
pleasure

say
he
,
as
they
do
that
of
sleep
,
without
taste
or
feel
it
as
it
slip

pass
by

<EOS>
We
should
study
and
ruminate
upon
it
,
in
order
to
render
proper
thank
to
him
who
grant
it
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
end
I
cause
myself
to
be
disturb
in
my
sleep
,
that
I
may
the
well
and
more
sensibly
relish
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
see
few
,
say
he
again
,
who
live
with
less
sleep
,
when
need
require
;
my
body
be
capable
of
a
firm
,
but
not
of
a
violent
and
sudden
agitation
 
<EOS>
I
evade
of
late
all
violent
exercise
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
weary
with
walk
 
but
from
my
youth
<EOS>
,
I
never
look
to
ride
upon
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
to
lie
hard
and
alone
,
and
even
without
my
wife
 
<EOS>
this
last
word
may
stagger
the
faith
of
the

but
remember
,
"
La
Vraisemblance

(
as
Bayle
say
in

of
Liceti

<EOS>
"

little

it
to
the
peace
of
a

that
you

I
possess

sit
here
silent
and
unmoved

such
a
storm
be
whistle
over

what
be
the
matter

Susannah
?
 
<EOS>
They
have

my

get
out
of
an
hysterick
fit

make
tea
for
yourself

down
his

how
different
from
the
sally
and
agitation
of
voice
and
member
which
a
common
reader
would
imagine
!
    
<EOS>
for
he
spake
in
the
sweetest
modulation
 
and
take
down
his
hat
with
the
genteel
movement
of
limb
,
that
ever
affliction
harmonize
and
attune
together
.
    
<EOS>
go
to
the
bowling
-
green
for
corporal
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
speak
to
Obadiah
,
as
soon
as
my

leave
the
room

<EOS>
when
the
misfortune
of
my
Nose
fall
so
heavily
upon
my
father
's
head
;
 
the
reader
remember
that
he
walk
instantly
up
stair
,
and
cast
himself
down
upon
his
bed
;
and
from
hence
,
unless
he
have
a
great
insight
into
human
nature
,
he
will
be
apt
to
expect
a
rotation
of
the
same
ascending
and
descend
movement
from
him
,
upon
this
misfortune
of
my
name
;
 
no
.
  
<EOS>
the
different
weight
,
dear
Sir
 
nay
even
the
different
package
of
two
vexation
of
the
same
weight
 
make
a
very
wide
difference
in
our
manner
of
bear
and
get
through
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
half
an
hour
ago
,
when
(
in
the
great
hurry
and
precipitation
of
a
poor
devil
's
writing
for
daily
bread
)
I
throw
a
fair
sheet
,
which
I
have
just
finish
,
and
carefully
write
out
,
slap
into
the
fire
,
instead
of
the
foul
one
.
  
<EOS>
instantly
I
snatch'd
off
my
wig
,
and
throw
it
perpendicularly
,
with
all
imaginable
violence
,
up
to
the
top
of
the
room
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
catch
it
as
it
fall
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
an
end
of
the
matter
;
nor
<EOS>
do
I
think
any
think
else
in
Nature
would
have
give
such
immediate
ease
:
 
She
,
dear
Goddess
,
by
an
instantaneous
impulse
,
in
all
provoking
case
,
determine
us
to
a
sally
of
this
or
that
member
 
or
else
she
thrust
us
into
this
or
that
place
,
or
posture
of
body
,
we
know
not
why
 
but
mark
,
madam
,
we
live
amongst
riddle
and
mystery
 
the
most
obvious
thing
,
which
come
in
our
way
,
have
dark
side
,
which
the
quick
sight
can
not
penetrate
into
;
and
even
the
clear
and
most
exalted
understanding
amongst
us
find
ourselves
puzzle
and
at
a
loss
in
almost
every
cranny
of
nature
's
work
:
 
so
that
this
,
like
a
thousand
other
thing
,
fall
out
for
us
in
a
way
,
which
tho
<EOS>
'
we
can
not
reason
upon
it
 
<EOS>
yet
we
find
the
good
of
it
,
may
it
please
your
reverence
and
your
worship
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
enough
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
my
father
could
not
lie
down
with
this
affliction
for
his
life
 
nor
could
he
carry
it
up
stair
like
the
other
 
<EOS>
he
walk
composedly
out
with
it
to
the
fish

pond
.
  
<EOS>
have
my
father
lean
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
reason
an
hour
which
way
to
have
go
 
reason
,
with
all
her
force
,
could
not
have
direct
him
to
any
think
like
it
:
 
there
be
something
,
Sir
,
in
fish

pond
 
<EOS>
but
what
it
be
,
I
leave
to
system
-
builder
and
fish

pond

digger
betwixt
'em
to
find
out
  
but
there
be
something
,
under
the
first
disorderly
transport
of
the
humour
,
so
unaccountably
becalm
in
an
orderly
and
a
sober
walk
towards
one
of
them
,
that
I
have
often
wonder
that
neither
Pythagoras
,
nor
Plato
,
nor
solon
,
nor
Lycurgus
,
nor
Mahomet
,
nor
any
one
of

order
about
them

<EOS>
Your

Trim

I

<EOS>
Trim
's
casuistry
and
address

under
the
cover
of
his
low
bow

prevent
all
suspicion
in
my

Toby

so
he
go
on
with
what
he
have
to
say
to
Trim
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
for
my

Trim
,
though
I
can
see
<EOS>
little

no
difference
betwixt
<EOS>

Tristram

Trismegistus
 
yet
as
the
thing
sit
so
near
my

I
would
freely
have

a

<EOS>
replied
Trim

I
would
not

<EOS>
nor
would
I

trim

upon
my

quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
my
brother
,
whom
there
be
no
arguing
with
in
this
case
 
maintain
that
a
great
deal
more
depend
,
trim
,
upon
christian

name

than
what
ignorant
people
imagine
 
<EOS>
for
he
say
there
never

heroic
action
perform
since
the
world
begin
by
one
call
Tristram
 
nay

he
will
have
it

Trim

that
a

neither

<EOS>
and
for

present
his

My

return
from
his

to
the
fish

and
open
the
parlour

<EOS>
My

hang
up
his
hat
with
the

air
he
take
it
down
;
and
after
give
a
slight
look
at
the
disorder
of
the
room
,
he
take
hold
of
one
of
the
chair
which
have
form
the
corporal
's
breach
,
and
place
it
over-
against
my

he
sit
down
in
it

and
as
soon
as
the
tea

thing
be
take
away
,
and
the
door
shut
,
he
break
out
in
a
lamentation
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
My
Father
's
Lamentation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
longer
,
say
my

address
himself
as
much
to
Ernulphus
's
curse
,
which
be
lay
upon
the
corner
of
the
chimney

piece
 
as
to
my

sit
under

it

say
my

in
the
most
querulous
monotony
imaginable
,
to
struggle
as
I
have
do
against
this
most
uncomfortable
of
human
persuasion
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
plainly
,
that
either
for
my

sin

brother
Toby

or
the
sin

folly
of
the
Shandy
family

Heaven
have
think
fit

forth
the

against

that
the

the
point
upon
which
the
whole
force
of
it

direct
to
play

such

on

I
question

by

the

whether
the

not

successfully

sundry
other

there
be
no

,
an
'

your

,
in

we
have
have
enough
of
it
 
<EOS>
so
there
be
an
end
of
that
matter
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
I
begin
my
demonstration
,
let
me
only
tell
you
,
that
the
chapter
which
I
have
tear
out
,
and
which
otherwise
you
would
all
have
be
read
just
now
,
instead

<EOS>
It

have
make

whether

twa
more
from

or
whether
,
lastly
,
it
be
from
the
sinister
turn

every

relate

be
apt
to
take
 
<EOS>
it
so
fall
out

however

to

that
instead

never
be
name
in
the
family
,
but
he
constantly
complain
of
carry
this
vile
mark
of
illegitimacy
upon
the
door
of
his
own
;
he
never
once
be
able
to
step
into
the
coach
,
or
out
of
it
,
without
turn
round
to
take
a
view
of
the
arm
,
and
make
a
vow
at
the
same
time
,
that
it
be
the
last
time
he
would
ever
set
his
foot
in
it
again
,
till
the
bend
-
sinister
be
take
out
 
but
like
the
affair
of
the
hinge
<EOS>
,
it
be
one
of
the
many
thing
which
the
Destinies
have
set
down
in
their
book
ever
to
be
grumble
at
(
and
in
wise
family
than
our
)
 
but
never
to
be
mend
.
    
<EOS>
have
the
bend
-
sinister
be
brush'd
out
<EOS>
,
I
say
?
<EOS>
say
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
nothing
brush'd
out
,
Sir
,
answer
Obadiah
,
but
the
lining
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
go
o'horseback
,
say
my
father
,
turn
to
Yorick
 
<EOS>
of
all
thing
in
the
world
,
except
politick
,
the
clergy
know
the
least
of
heraldry
,
say
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
for
that
,
cry
my
father
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
appear
with
a
blot
in
my
escutcheon
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
never
mind
the
bend
-
sinister
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
put
on
his
tye
-
wig
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
say
my
father
 
<EOS>
you
may
go
with
my
aunt
Dinah
to
a
visitation
with
a
bend
-
sinister
,
if
you
think
fit
 
<EOS>
My
poor
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
blush'd
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
be
vex
at
himself
.
 
<EOS>
no
 
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
say
my
father
,
change
his
tone
 
but
the
damp
of
the
coach-
line
about
my
loin
,
may
give
me
the
sciatica
again
,
as
it
do
December
,
January
,
and
February
<EOS>
last
winter
 
<EOS>
so
if
you
please
you
shall
ride
my
wife
's
pad
 
<EOS>
and
as
you
be
to
preach
,
Yorick
,
you
have
better
make
the
good
of
your
way
before
 
and
leave
me
to
take
care
of
my
brother
Toby
,
and
to
follow
at
our
own
rate
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
chapter
I
be
oblige
to
tear
out
,
be
the
description
of
this
cavalcade
,
in
which
Corporal
Trim
and
Obadiah
,
upon
two
coach
-
horse
a-
breast
,
lead
the
way
as
slow
as
a
patrole
 
<EOS>
whilst
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
his
laced
regimental
and
tye
-
wig
,
keep
his
rank
with
my
father
,
in
deep
road
and
dissertation
alternately
upon
the
advantage
of
learning
and
arm
,
as
each
could
get
the
start
.
    
<EOS>
but
the
painting
of
this
journey
,
upon
review
it
,
appear
to
be
so
much
above
the
stile
and
manner
of
any
thing
else
I
have
be
able
to
paint
in
this
book
,
that
it
could
not
have
remain
in
it
,
without
depreciate
every
other
scene
;
and
destroy
at
the
same
time
that
necessary
equipoise
and
balance
,
(
whether
of
good
or
bad
)
<EOS>
betwixt
chapter
and
chapter
,
from
whence
the
just
proportion
and
harmony
of
the
whole
work
result
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
be
but
just
set
up
in
the
business
,
so
know
little
about
it
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
to
write
a
book
be
for
all
the
world
like
hum
a
song
 
<EOS>
be
but
in
tune
with
yourself
,
madam
,
'
<EOS>
tis
no
matter
how
high
or
how
low
you
take
it
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
the
reason
,
<EOS>
may
it
please
your
reverence
,
that
some
of
the
low
and
flat
composition
pass
off
very
well
 
(
as
Yorick
tell
my
uncle
Toby
one
night
)
by
siege
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
look
brisk
at
the
sound
of
the
word
siege
,
but
could
make
neither
head
or
tail
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
to
preach
at
court
next
Sunday
,
say
Homenas
 
run
over
my
note
 
<EOS>
so
I
humm'd
over
doctor
Homenas
's
note
 
<EOS>
the
modulation
's
very
well
 
<EOS>
'
twill
do
,
Homenas
,
if
it
hold
on
at
this
rate
 
so
on
I
<EOS>
humm'd
 
and
<EOS>
a
tolerable
tune
I
think
it
be
;
and
to
this
hour
,
may
it
please
your
reverence
,
have
never
find
out
how
low
,
how
flat
,
how
spiritless
and
jejune
it
be
,
but
that
all
of
a
sudden
,
up
start
an
air
in
the
middle
of
it
,
so
fine
<EOS>
,
so
rich
,
so
heavenly
,
 
it
carry
my
soul
up
with
it
into
the
other
world
;
now
have
I
(
as
Montaigne
complain
in
a
parallel
accident
)
 
<EOS>
have
I
find
the
declivity
easy
,
or
the
ascent
accessible
 
<EOS>
certe
I
have
be
outwit
.
  
<EOS>
Your
note
,
Homenas
,
I
should
have
say
,
be
good
note
;
 
but
it
be
so
perpendicular
a
precipice
 
so
wholly
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
work
,
that
by
the
first
note
I
humm'd
I
find
myself
fly
into
the
other
world
,
and
from
thence
discover
the
vale
from
whence
<EOS>
I
come
,
<EOS>
so
deep
,
so
low
,
and
dismal
,
that
I
shall
never
have
the
heart
to
descend
into
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
>
<EOS>
a
dwarf
who
bring
a
standard
along
with
him
to
measure
his
own
size
  
take
my
word
,
be
a
dwarf
in
more
article
than
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
much
for
tear
out
of
chapter
.
      
<EOS>
see
if
he
be
not
cut
it
into
slip
,
and
give
them
about
him
to
light
their
pipe
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
abominable

answer
Didius
;
it
should
not
go
unnoticed

doctor
Kysarcius--

Kysarcii

the
Low
Countries

<EOS>
Methinks
,
say
Didius
,
half
rise
from
his
chair
,
in
order
to
remove
a
bottle
and
a
tall
decanter
,
which
stand
in
a
direct
line
betwixt
him
and
<EOS>
Yorick
 
<EOS>
you
may
have
spare
this
sarcastic
stroke
,
and
have
hit
upon
a
more
proper
place
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Yorick
 
or
at
least
upon
a
more
proper
occasion
to
have
shew
your
contempt
of
what
we
have
be
about
:
 
if
the
sermon
be
of
no
better
worth
than
to
light
pipe
with
 
'
twas
certainly
,
Sir
,
not
good
enough
to
be
preach
before
<EOS>
so
learn
a
body
;

twas
good

to
be

before
so
learn
a

<EOS>
twas
certainly
<EOS>
Sir

too
good
to
light
their
pipe
with
afterwards

<EOS>
I
have
get
him
fast
hang
up
,
quoth
Didius
to
himself
,
<EOS>
upon
one
of
the
two
horn
of
my
dilemma
 
let
him
get
off
as
he
can
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
undergo
such
unspeakable
torment
,
in
bring
forth
this
sermon
,
quoth
Yorick
,
upon
this
occasion
 
that
I
declare
,
Didius
<EOS>
,
I
would
suffer
martyrdom
 
and
if
it
be
possible
my
horse
with
me
,
a
thousand
time
over
,
before
I
would
sit
down
and
make
such
another
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
deliver
of
it
at
the
wrong
end
of
me
 
<EOS>
it
come
from
my
head
instead
of
my
heart
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
for
the
pain
it
give
me
,
both
in
the
writing
and
preaching
of
it
,
that
I
revenge
myself
of
it
,
in
this
manner
 
to
preach
<EOS>
,
to
shew
the
extent
of
our
reading
,
or
the
subtlety
of
our
wit
 
to
parade
in
the
eye
of
the
vulgar
with
the
beggarly
account
of
a
little
learning
,
tinsel'd
over
with
a
few
word
which
glitter
,
but
convey
little
light
and
less
warmth
 
be
a
dishonest
use
of
the
poor
single
half
hour
in
a
week
which
be
put
into
our
hand
 
'
Tis
not
preach
the
gospel
 
but
ourselves
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
continue
Yorick
,
I
have
rather
direct
five
word
point

blank
to
the

<EOS>
as
Yorick
pronounce
the
word

blank

my
uncle
Toby
rise
up
to
say
something
upon
projectile
 
when
a
single
word
and
no
more
uttered
from
the
opposite
side
of

every

in

next
chapter

<EOS>
Zounds
!
 
<EOS>
z

ds
!
<EOS>
cry
Phutatorius
,
partly
to
himself
 
and
yet
high
enough
to
be
hear
 
and
what
seem
odd
,
'
twas
utter
in
a
construction
of
look
,
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
,
somewhat
between
that
of
a
man
in
amazement
and
one
in
bodily
pain
.
  
<EOS>
one
or
two
who
have
very
nice
ear
,
and
could
distinguish
the
expression
and
mixture
of
the
two
tone
as
plainly
as
a
third
or
a
fifth
,
or
any
other
chord
in
musick
 
be
the
most
puzzled
and
perplex
with
it
 
<EOS>
the
concord
be
good
in
itself
 
<EOS>
but
then
'
twas
quite
out
of
the
key
,
and
no
way
applicable
to
the
subject
start
;
 
so
that
with
all
their
knowledge
,
they
could
not
tell
what
in
the
world
to
make
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
other
who
know
nothing
of
musical
expression
,
and
merely
lend
their
ear
to
the
plain
import
of
the
word
,
imagine
that
Phutatorius
,
who
be
somewhat
of
a
cholerick
spirit
,
be
just
go
to
snatch
the
cudgel
out
of
Didius
's
hand
,
in
order
to
bemaul
Yorick
to
some
purpose
 
and
that
the
desperate
monosyllable
z
...
ds
be
the
exordium
to
an
oration
,
which
,
as
they
judge
from
the
sample
,
presage
but
a
rough
kind
of
handling
of
him
;
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
good
-
nature
feel
a
pang
for
what
Yorick
be
about
to
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
but
see
Phutatorius
stop
short
,
without
any
attempt
or
desire
to
go
on
 
a
third
party
begin
to
suppose
,
that
it
be
no
more
than
an
involuntary
respiration
,
casually
form
itself
into
the
shape
of
a
twelve
-
penny
oath
 
without
the
sin
or
substance
of
one
.
  
<EOS>
other
,
and
especially
one
or
two
who
sit
next
him
,
look
upon
it
on
the
contrary
as
a
real
and
substantial
oath
,
propensly
form
against
Yorick
,
to
whom
he
be
know
to
bear
no
good
like
 
which
say
oath
,
as
my
father
philosophize
upon
it
,
actually
lay
fretting
and
fuming
at
that
very
time
in
the
upper
region
of
Phutatorius
's
purtenance
;
and
so
be
naturally
,
and
accord
to
the
due
course
of
thing
,
first
squeeze
out
by
the
sudden
influx
of
blood
which
be
drive
into
the
right
ventricle
of
Phutatorius
's
heart
,
by
the
stroke
of
surprize
which
so
strange
a
theory
of
preaching
have
excite
.
  
<EOS>
how
finely
we
argue
upon
mistaken
fact
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
soul
busy
in
all
these
various
reasoning
upon
the
monosyllable
which
Phutatorius
utter
 
who
do
not
take
this
for
grant
,
proceed
upon
it
as
from
an
axiom
,
namely
,
that
Phutatorius
's
mind
be
intent
upon
the
subject
of
debate
which
be
arise
between
Didius
and
Yorick
;
and
indeed
as
he
look
first
towards
the
one
and
then
towards
the
other
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
listen
to
what
be
go
forwards
 
who
would
not
have
think
the
same
?
 
<EOS>
but
the
truth
be
,
that
Phutatorius
know
not
one
word
or
one
syllable
of
what
be
pass
 
but
his
whole
thought
and
attention
be
take
up
with
a
transaction
which
be
go
forwards
at
that
very
instant
within
the
precinct
of
his
own
Galligaskins
,
and
in
a
part
of
them
,
where
of
all
other
he
stand
most
interested
to
watch
accident
:
 
so
that
notwithstanding
he
look
with
all
the
attention
in
the
world
,
and
have
gradually
skrewe
up
every
nerve
and
muscle
in
his
face
,
to
the
utmost
pitch
the
instrument
would
bear
,
in
order
,
as
it
be
think
,
to
give
a
sharp
reply
to
Yorick
,
who
sit
over
-
against
him
 
yet
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
be
yorick
never
once
in
any
one
domicile
of
Phutatorius
's
brain
 
but
<EOS>
the
true
cause
of
his
exclamation
lie
at
least
a
yard
below
.
   
<EOS>
this
I
will
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
with
all
imaginable
decency
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
be
inform
then
,
that
Gastripheres
,
who
have
take
a
turn
into
the
kitchen
a
little
before
dinner
,
to
see
how
thing
go
on
 
observe
a
wicker
-
basket
of
fine
chesnut
stand
upon
the
dresser
,
have
order
that
a
hundred
or
two
of
them
may
be
roast
and
send
in
,
as
soon
as
dinner
be
over
 
gastriphere
inforce
his
order
about
them
,
that
Didius
,
but
Phutatorius
<EOS>
especially
,
be
particularly
fond
of
'em
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
minute
before
the
time
that
my
uncle
Toby
interrupt
Yorick
's
harangue
 
Gastripheres
's
chesnut
be
bring
in
 
and
as
Phutatorius
's
fondness
for
'em
be
uppermost
in
the
waiter
's
head
,
he
lay
them
directly
before
Phutatorius
,
wrapt
up
hot
in
a
clean
damask
napkin
.
  
<EOS>
now
whether
it
be
physically
impossible
,
with
half
a
dozen
hand
all
thrust
into
the
napkin
at
a
time
 
but
that
some
one
chesnut
,
of
more
life
and
rotundity
than
the
rest
,
must
be
put
in
motion
 
<EOS>
it
so
fall
out
,
however
,
that
one
be
actually
send
roll
off
the
table
;
and
as
Phutatorius
sit
straddle
under
 
it
fall
perpendicularly
into
that
particular
aperture
of
Phutatorius
's
breech
,
for
which
,
to
the
shame
and
indelicacy
of
our
language
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
it
speak
,
there
be
no
chaste
word
throughout
all
Johnson
's
dictionary
 
let
it
suffice
to
say
 
it
be
that
particular
aperture
which
,
in
all
good
society
,
the
law
of
decorum
do
strictly
require
,
like
the
temple
of
Janus
(
in
peace
at
least
)
to
be
universally
shut
up
.
  
<EOS>
the
neglect
of
this
punctilio
in
Phutatorius

which
by

<EOS>
Accident
<EOS>
I
call
it
,
in
compliance
to
a
received
mode
of
speak
 
but
in
no
opposition
to
the
opinion
either
of
Acrites
or
Mythogeras
<EOS>
in
this
matter
;
I
know
they
be
both
prepossess
and
fully
persuade
of
it
 
and
be
so
to
this
hour
,
that
there
be
nothing
of
accident
in
the
whole
event
 
but
that
the
chesnut
's
take
that
particular
course
,
and
in
a
manner
of
its
own
accord
 
and
then
fall
with
all
its
heat
directly
into
that
one
particular
place
,
and
no
other
 
be
a
real
judgment
upon
Phutatorius
for
that
filthy
and
obscene
treatise
de
Concubinis
retinendis
,
which
Phutatorius
have
publish
about
twenty
year
ago
 
and
be
that
identical
week
go
to
give
the
world
a
second
edition
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
business
to
dip
my
pen
in
this
controversy
 
much
undoubtedly
may
be
write
on
both
side
of
the
question
 
all
that
concern
me
as
an
historian
,
be
to
represent
the
matter
of
fact
,
and
render
it
credible
to
the
reader
,
that
the
hiatus
in
Phutatorius
's
breech
be
sufficiently
wide
to
receive
the
chesnut
;
 
and
that
the
chesnut
,
somehow
or
other
,
do
fall
perpendicularly
,
and
pipe
hot
into
it
,
without
Phutatorius
's
perceive
it
,
or
any
one
else
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
genial
warmth
which
the
chesnut
impart
,
be
not
undelectable
for
the
first
twenty
or
five
-
and
-
twenty
second
 
and
do
no
more
than
gently
solicit
Phutatorius
's
attention
towards
the
part
:
 
<EOS>
but
the
heat
gradually
increase
,
and
in
a
few
second
more
get
beyond
the
point
of
all
sober
pleasure
,
and
then
advance
with
all
speed
into
the
region
of
pain
,
the
soul
of
Phutatorius
,
together
with
all
his
idea
,
his
thought
,
his
attention
,
his
imagination
,
judgment
,
resolution
,
deliberation
,
ratiocination
,
memory
,
fancy
,
with
ten
battalion
of
animal
spirit
,
all
tumultuously
crowd
down
,
through
different
defile
and
circuit
,
to
the
place
of
danger
,
leave
all
his
upper
region
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
as
empty
as
my
purse
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
good
intelligence
which
all
these
messenger
could
bring
him
back
,
Phutatorius
be
not
able
to
dive
into
the
secret
of
what
be
go
forwards
below
,
nor
could
he
make
any
kind
of
conjecture
,
what
the
devil
be
the
matter
with
it
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
as
he
know
not
what
the
true
cause
may
turn
out
,
he
deem
it
most
prudent
in
the
situation
he
be
in
at
present
,
to
bear
it
,
if
possible
,
like
a
Stoick
;
which
,
with
the
help
of
some
wry
face
and
compursion
of
the
mouth
,
he
have
certainly
accomplish
,
have
his
imagination
continue
neuter
;
 
but
the
sally
of
the
imagination
be
ungovernable
in
thing
of
this
kind
 
<EOS>
a
thought
instantly
dart
into
his
mind
,
that
tho
'
<EOS>
the
anguish
have
the
sensation
of
glow
heat
 
<EOS>
it
may
,
notwithstanding
that
,
be
a
bite
as
well
as
a
burn
;
and
if
so
,
that
possibly
a
Newt
or
an
Asker
,
or
some
such
detest
reptile
,
have
creep
up
,
and
be
fasten
his
tooth
 
<EOS>
the
horrid
idea
of
which
,
with
a
fresh
glow
of
pain
arise
that
instant
from
the
chesnut
,
seize
Phutatorius
with
a
sudden
panick
,
and
in
the
first
terrifying
disorder
of
the
passion
,
it
throw
him
,
as
it
have
do
the
good
general
upon
earth
,
quite
off
his
guard
:
 
the
effect
of
which
be
this
,
that
he
leap
incontinently
up
,
utter
as
he
rise
that
interjection
of
surprise
so
much
descant
upon
,
with
the
aposiopestic
break
after
it
,
mark
thus
,
z
...
ds
 
<EOS>
which
,
though
not
strictly
canonical
,
be
still
as
little
as
any
man
could
have
say
upon
the
occasion
;
 
and
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
whether
canonical
or
not
,
Phutatorius
could
no
more
help
than
he
could
the
cause
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
though
this
have
take
up
some
time
in
the
narrative
,
it
take
up
little
more
time
in
the
transaction
,
than
just
to
allow
time
for
Phutatorius
to
draw
forth
the
chesnut
,
and
throw
it
down
with
violence
upon
the
floor
 
and
for
Yorick
to
rise
from
his
chair
,
and
pick
the
chesnut
up
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
curious
to
observe
the
triumph
of
slight
incident
over
the
mind
:
  
<EOS>
what
incredible
weight
they
have
in
form
and
govern
our
opinion
,
both
of
man
and
thing
 
<EOS>
that
trifle
,
light
as
air
,
shall
waft
a
belief
into
the
soul
,
and
plant
it
so
immoveably
within
it
 
that
Euclid
's
demonstration
,
could
they
be
bring
to
batter
it
in
breach
,
should
not
all
have
power
to
overthrow
it
.
  
<EOS>
Yorick
,
I
say
,
pick
up
the
chesnut
which
Phutatorius
's
wrath
have
fling
down
 
<EOS>
the
action
be
trifle
 
I
be
ashamed
to
account
for
it
 
<EOS>
he
do
it
,
for
no
reason
,
but
that
he
think
the
chesnut
not
a
jot
bad
for
the
adventure
 
and
that
he
hold
a
good
chesnut
worth
stoop
for
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
incident
,
trifle
as
it
be
,
work
differently
in
Phutatorius
's
head
:
 
<EOS>
He
consider
this
act
of
Yorick
's
in
get
off
his
chair
and
pick
up
the
chesnut
,
as
a
plain
acknowledgment
in
him
,
that
the
chesnut
be
originally
his
 
and
in
course
,
that
it
must
have
be
the
owner
of
the
chesnut
,
and
no
one
else
,
who
could
have
play
him
such
a
prank
with
it
:
 
<EOS>
what
greatly
confirm
him
in
this
opinion
,
be
this
,
that
the
table
be
parallelogramical
and
very
narrow
,
it
afford
a
fair
opportunity
for
Yorick
,
who
sit
directly
over
against
Phutatorius
,
of
slip
the
chesnut
in
 
and
consequently
that
he
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
look
of
something
more
than
suspicion
,
which
Phutatorius
cast
full
upon
Yorick
as
these
thought
arise
,
too
evidently
speak
his
opinion
 
and
as
Phutatorius
be
naturally
suppose
to
know
more
of
the
matter
than
any
person
besides
,
his
opinion
at
once
become
the
general
one
;
 
and
for
a
reason
very
different
from
any
which
have
be
yet
give
 
in
a
little
time
it
be
put
out
of
all
manner
of
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
when
great
or
unexpected
event
fall
out
upon
the
stage
of
this
sublunary
world
 
<EOS>
the
mind
of
man
,
which
be
an
inquisitive
kind
of
a
substance
,
naturally
take
a
flight
behind
the
scene
to
see
what
be
the
cause
and
first
spring
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
search
be
not
long
in
this
instance
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
know
that
Yorick
have
never
a
good
opinion
of
the
treatise
which
Phutatorius
have
write
de
Concubinis
retinendis
,
as
a
thing
which
he
fear
have
do
hurt
in
the
world
 
and
'
twas
easily
find
out
,
that
there
be
a
mystical
meaning
in
Yorick
's
prank
 
and
that
his
chuck
the
chesnut
hot
into
Phutatorius
's
.
<EOS>
.
.
 
<EOS>
.
.
.
,
be
a
sarcastical
fling
at
his
book
  
the
doctrine
of
which
,
they
say
,
have
enflame
many
an
honest
man
in
the
same
place
.
  
<EOS>
this
conceit
awaken'd
<EOS>
Somnolentus
 
make
Agelastes
smile
 
<EOS>
and
if
you
can
recollect
the
precise
look
and
air
of
a
man
's
face
intent
in
find
out
a
riddle
 
<EOS>
it
throw
Gastripheres
's
into
that
form
 
and
in
short
be
think
by
many
to
be
a
master
-
stroke
of
arch
-
wit
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
as
the
reader
have
see
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
be
as
groundless
as
the
dream
of
philosophy
:
 
Yorick
,
no
doubt
,
as
Shakespeare
say
of
his
ancestor
 
"
be
a
man
of
jest
,
"
but
it
be
temper'd
with
something
which
withhold
him
from
that
,
and
many
other
ungracious
prank
,
of
which
he
as
undeservedly
bear
the
blame
;
 
but
it
be
his
misfortune
all
his
life
long
to
bear
the
imputation
of
say
and
do
a
thousand
thing
,
of
which
(
unless
my
esteem
blind
me
)
<EOS>
his
nature
be
incapable
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
blame
him
for
 
or
rather
,
all
I
blame
and
alternately
like
him
for
,
be
that
singularity
of
his
temper
,
which
would
never
suffer
him
to
take
pain
to
set
a
story
right
with
the
world
,
however
in
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
in
every
ill
usage
of
that
sort
,
he
act
precisely
as
in
the
affair
of
his
lean
horse
 
he
could
have
explain
it
to
his
honour
,
but
his
spirit
be
above
it
;
and
besides
,
he
ever
look
upon
the
inventor
,
the
propagator
and
believer
of
an
illiberal
report
alike
so
injurious
to
him
 
he
could
not
stoop
to
tell
his
story
to
them
 
and
so
trust
to
time
and
truth
to
do
it
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
heroic
cast
produce
him
inconvenience
in
many
respect
 
in
the
present
it
be
follow
by
the
fix
resentment
of
Phutatorius
,
who
,
as
Yorick
have
just
make
an
end
of
his
chesnut
,
rise
up
from
his
chair
a
second
time
,
to
let
him
know
it
 
<EOS>
which
indeed
he
do
with
a
smile
;
say
only
  
that
he
would
endeavour
not
to
forget
the
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
but
you
must
mark
and
carefully
separate
and
distinguish
these
two
thing
in
your
mind
.
    
<EOS>
the
smile
be
for
the
company
.
    
<EOS>
the
threat
be
for
Yorick
.
      
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
,
quoth
Phutatorius
,
speak
to
Gastripheres
who
sit
next
to
him
 
for
one
would
not
apply
to
a
surgeon
in
so
foolish
an
affair
 
<EOS>
can
you
tell
me
,
Gastripheres
,
what
be
good
to
take
out
the
fire
?
 
<EOS>
Ask
Eugenius
,
say
Gastripheres
.
 
<EOS>
that
greatly
depend
,
say
Eugenius
,
pretend
ignorance
of
the
adventure
,
upon
the
nature
of
the
part
 
if
it
be
a
tender
part
,
and
a
part
which
can
conveniently
be
wrapt
up
 
<EOS>
It
be
both
the
one
and
the
other
,
reply
Phutatorius
,
lay
his
hand
as
he
speak
,
with
an
emphatical
nod
of
his
head
,
upon
the
part
in
question
,
and
lift
up
his
right
leg
at
the
same
time
to
ease
and
ventilate
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
be
the
case
,
say
Eugenius
,
I
would
advise
you
,
Phutatorius
,
not
to
tamper
with
it
by
any
mean
;
but
if
you
will
send
to
the
next
printer
,
and
trust
your
cure
to
such
a
simple
thing
as
a
soft
sheet
of
paper
just
come
off
the
press
  
<EOS>
you
need
do
nothing
more
than
twist
it
round
.
 
<EOS>
the
damp
paper
,
quoth
Yorick
(
who
sit
next
to
his
friend
Eugenius
)
though
I
know
it
have
a
refresh
coolness
in
it
 
<EOS>
yet
I
presume
be
no
more
than
the
vehicle
 
and
that
the
oil
and
lamp
-
black
with
which
the
paper
be
so
strongly
impregnate
,
do
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
right
,
say
Eugenius
,
and
be
,
of
any
outward
application
I
would
venture
to
recommend
,
the
most
anodyne
and
safe
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
my
case
,
say
Gastripheres
,
as
the
main
thing
be
the
oil
and
lamp-
black
,
I
should
spread
them
thick
upon
a
rag
,
and
clap
it
on
directly
.
  
<EOS>
that
would
make
a
very
devil
of
it
,
reply
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
and
besides
,
add
Eugenius
,
it
would
not
answer
the
intention
,
which
be
the
extreme
neatness
and
elegance
of
the
prescription
,
which
the
Faculty
hold
to
be
half
in
half
;
 
for
consider
,
if
the
type
be
a
very
small
one
(
which
it
should
be
)
<EOS>
the
sanative
particle
,
which
come
into
contact
in
this
form
,
have
the
advantage
of
be
spread
so
infinitely
thin
,
and
with
such
a
mathematical
equality
(
fresh
paragraph
and
large
capital
except
)
as
no
art
or
management
of
the
spatula
can
come
up
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
fall
out
very
luckily
,
reply
Phutatorius
,
that
the
second
edition
of
my
treatise
de
Concubinis
retinendis
be
at
this
instant
in
the
press

<EOS>
You
may
take
any
leaf
of
it

say
Eugenius
 
<EOS>
no
matter
which

<EOS>
provide

quoth
Yorick

there
be
no
bawdry
in
it

<EOS>
They
be
just
now

reply
Phutatorius
,
print
off
the
ninth
chapter
  
which
be
the
last
chapter
but
one
in
the
book

<EOS>
pray
what
be
the
title
of
that
chapter
?
<EOS>
say
Yorick
;
make
a
respectful
bow
to
Phutatorius
as
he
speak

I

Phutatorius

to
have
pronounce
the

null

with

I
beg

as

for

<EOS>
what
do
they

<EOS>
say
my

<EOS>
nothing

Ergo

such

in

continue
Kysarcius

where
patriae

put

patris
,
filia
for
filii

and
so
on
 
as
it
be
a
fault
only
in
the
declension

and
the
root
of
the
word
continue
untouch'd
,
the
inflection
of
their
branch
either
this
way
or
that
,
do
not
in
any
sort
hinder
the
baptism
,
inasmuch
as
the

sense
continue
in
the
word
as
before

<EOS>
but
then
,
say
Didius

the
intention
of
the
priest

pronouncing
them
grammatically

have

<EOS>
right

answer
Kysarcius

we

My

the

that

He

stopp'd

@@@ti
a
ground

in

,
say
Triptolemus
,
that
thing
do
not
ascend

descend
in
it
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
'
tis
for
this
cause
,
that
however
true
it
be
,
that
the
child
may
be
of

seed
of
its
parent
 
that
the
parent
,
nevertheless
,
be
not
of

seed
of
it
;
inasmuch
as
the
parent
be
not
beget
by
the

but
the
child
by
the

<EOS>
for
<EOS>
so
they
write

this
authority
<EOS>
cite
it
would
follow

not

what
indeed
be
grant

that
the

be

the

likewise

<EOS>
It
be
hold

because
the

there

there
be
in

that

t'other
  
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
Rome
 
<EOS>
he
would
go
to
law
 
<EOS>
he
would
buy
stock
 
<EOS>
he
would
buy
John
Hobson

<EOS>
he
would
new
fore
front
his

add
a
new
wing
to
make
it
even
 
there
be
a
fine
water

mill
on
this
side
,
and
he
would
build
a
wind
-
mill
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
full
view
to
answer
it
 
<EOS>
but
above
all
thing
in
the
world
,
he
would
inclose
the
great
Ox
-
moor
,
and
send
out
my
brother
Bobby
immediately
upon
his
travel
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
the
sum
be
finite
,
and
consequently
could
not
do
every
thing

in
truth
<EOS>
very
few
of
these
to
any
purpose
 
of
all
the
project
which
offer
themselves
upon
this
occasion

the
two
last
seem
to
make
the
deep
impression
;
and
he
would
infallibly
have
determine
upon
both
at
once
,
but
for
the
small
inconvenience
hint
at
above
,
which
absolutely
put
him
under
a
necessity
of
decide
in
favour
either
of
the
one
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
altogether
so
easy
to
be
do
;
for
though
'
tis
certain
my
father
have
long
before
set
his
heart
upon
this
necessary
part
of
my
brother
's
education
,
and
like
a
prudent
man
have
actually
determine
to
carry
it
into
execution
,
with
the
first
money
that
return
from
the
second
creation
of
action
in
the
Missisippi

in
which
he

whinny

belong
to

have
almost
as
old
a
claim
upon
him
:
 
he
have
long
and
affectionately
set
his
heart
upon
turn
it
likewise
to
some
account
.
  
<EOS>
but
have
never
hitherto
be
press
with
such
a
conjuncture
of
thing
,
as
make
it
necessary
to
settle
either
the
priority
or
justice
of
their
claim
 
like
a
wise
man
he
have
refrain
enter
into
any
nice
or
critical
examination
about
them
:
 
so
that
upon
the
dismission
of
every
other
project
at
this
crisis
 
<EOS>
the
two
old
project
,
the
Ox
-
moor
and
my
Brother
,
divide
him
again
;
and
so
equal
a
match
be
they
for
each
other
,
as
to
become
the
occasion
of
no
small
contest
in
the
old
gentleman

mind
 
which
of
the
two
should
be
set
o'goe
first

<EOS>
People
may
laugh
as
they
will
 
but
the
case
be
this

<EOS>
It
have
ever
be
the
custom
of
the
family

and
by
length
of
time
be
almost
become
a
matter
of
common
right

that
the
eld
son

it
should
have
free

egress

and
regress
into

better
his

part

the
benefit

exercise

change
of
so
much

tantum

my

say

quantum

<EOS>
now
as
this
be
a
reasonable
,
and
in
course
a
most
christian
indulgence
 
to
deprive
him
of
it
,
without
why
or
wherefore
 
and
thereby
make
an
example
of
him
,
as
the
first
Shandy
unwhirl'd
about
Europe
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
only
because
he
be
a
heavy
lad
 
would
be
use
him
ten
time
bad
than
a
Turk
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
case
of
the
Ox

moor
be
full
as
hard

<EOS>
exclusive
of
the
original
purchase
-
money
,
which
be
eight
hundred
pound
  
<EOS>
it
have
cost
the
family
eight
hundred
pound
more
in
a
law
-
suit
about
fifteen
year
before
 
besides
the
Lord
know
what
trouble
and
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
moreover
in
possession
of
the
Shandy
-
family
ever
since
the
middle
of
the
last
century
;
and
though
it
lie
full
in
view
before
the
house
,
bound
on
one
extremity
by
the
water
-
mill
,
and
on
the
other
by
the
project
wind
-
mill
spoken
of
above
 
and
for
all
these
reason
seem
to
have
the
fair
title
of
any
part
of
the
estate
to
the
care
and
protection
of
the
family
 
yet
by
an
unaccountable
fatality
,
common
to
man
,
as
well
as
the
ground
they
tread
on
 
<EOS>
it
have
all
along
most
shamefully
be
overlook'd
;
and
to
speak
the
truth
of
it
,
have
suffer
so
much
by
it
,
that
it
would
have
make
any
man
's
heart
have
bleed
(
Obadiah
say
)
who
understand
the
value
of
the
land
,
to
have
ride
over
it
,
and
only
see
the
condition
it
be
in
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
neither
the
purchasing
this
tract
of
ground
 
nor
indeed
the
placing
of
it
where
it
lie
,
be
either
of
them
,
properly
speak
,
of
my
father
's
do
 
he
have
never
think
himself
any
way
concern
in
the
affair
 
till
the
fifteen
year
before
,
when
the
breaking
out
of
that
cursed
law
-
suit
mention
above
(
and
which
have
arise
about
its
boundary
)
 
<EOS>
which
be
altogether
my
father
's
own
act
and
deed
,
it
naturally
awaken
every
other
argument
in
its
favour
,
and
upon
sum
them
all
up
together
,
he
see
,
not
merely
in
interest
,
but
in
honour
,
he
be
bind
to
do
something
for
it
 
and
that
now
or
never
be
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
there
must
certainly
have
be
a
mixture
of
ill
-
luck
in
it
,
that
the
reason
on
both
side
should
happen
to
be
so
equally
balance
by
each
other
;
for
though
my
father
weigh'd
<EOS>
them
in
all
humour
and
condition
  
spend
many
an
anxious
hour
in
the
most
profound
and
abstract
meditation
upon
what
be
good
to
be
do
 
read
book
of
farm
one
day
 
book
of
travel
another
 
lay
aside
all
passion
<EOS>
whatever
 
view
the
argument
on
both
side
in
all
their
light
and
circumstance
 
commune
every
day
with
my
uncle
Toby
 
argue
with
Yorick
,
and
talk
over
the
whole
affair
of
the
Ox
-
moor
with
Obadiah
 
yet
nothing
in
all
that
time
appear
so
strongly
in
behalf
of
the
one
,
which
be
not
either
strictly
applicable
to
the
other
,
or
at
least
so
far
counterbalance
by
some
consideration
of
equal
weight
,
as
to
keep
the
scale
even
.
  
<EOS>
for
to
be
sure
,
with
proper
help
,
in
the
hand
of
some
people
,
tho
'
the
Ox
-
moor
would
undoubtedly
have
make
a
different
appearance
in
the
world
from
what
it
do
,
or
ever
could
do
in
the
condition
it
lie
 
yet
<EOS>
every
tittle
of
this
be
true
,
with
regard
to
my
brother
<EOS>
Bobby
 
<EOS>
let
Obadiah
say
what
he
would
.
    
<EOS>
in
point
of
interest
 
<EOS>
the
contest
,
I
own
,
at
first
sight
,
do
not
appear
<EOS>
so
undecisive
betwixt
them
;
for
whenever
my
father
take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
,
and
set
about
calculate
the
simple
expence
of
paring
and
burn
,
and
fence
in
the
Ox
-
moor
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
with
the
certain
profit
it
would
bring
him
in
return
 
<EOS>
the
latter
turn
out
so
prodigiously
in
his
way
of
work
the
account
,
that
you
would
have
swear
the
Ox
-
moor
would
have
carry
all
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
plain
he
should
reap
a
hundred
last
of
rape
,
at
twenty
pound
a
last
,
the
very
first
year
 
besides
an
excellent
crop
of
wheat
the
year
follow
 
and
the
year
after
that
,
to
speak
within
bound
,
a
hundred
 
<EOS>
but
in
all
likelihood
,
a
hundred
and
fifty
 
if
not
two
hundred
quarter
of
pease
and
bean
 
besides
potato
without
end
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
to
think
he
be
all
this
while
breed
up
my
brother
,
like
a
hog
to
eat
them
 
knock
all
on
the
head
again
,
and
generally
leave
the
old
gentleman
in
such
a
state
of
suspense
 
that
,
as
he
often
declare
to
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
he
know
no
more
than
his
heel
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
no
body
,
but
he
who
have
feel
it
,
can
conceive
what
a
plaguing
thing
it
be
to
have
a
man
's
mind
tear
asunder
by
two
project
of
equal
strength
,
both
obstinately
pull
in
a
contrary
direction
at
the
same
time
:
 
for
to
say
nothing
of
the
havock
,
which
by
a
certain
consequence
be
unavoidably
make
by
it
all
over
the
fine
system
of
the
nerve
,
which
you
know
convey
the
animal
spirit
and
more
subtle
juice
from
the
heart
to
the
head
,
and
so
on
 
it
be
not
to
be
tell
in
what
a
degree
such
a
wayward
kind
of
friction
work
upon
the
more
gross
and
solid
part
,
waste
the
fat
and
impair
the
strength
of
a
man
every
time
as
it
go
backwards
and
forwards
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
have
certainly
sink
under
this
evil
,
as
certainly
as
he
have
do
under
that
of
my
Christian
Name
 
<EOS>
have
he
not
be
rescue
out
of
it
,
as
he
be
out
of
that
,
by
a
fresh
evil
 
the
misfortune
of
my
brother
Bobby
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
life
of
man

<EOS>
be
it
not
to
shift
from
side
to
side

<EOS>
from
sorrow

sorrow

<EOS>
to
button
up
one
cause
of
vexation

unbutton
another
?
    
<EOS>
from
this
moment
I
be
to
be
consider
as
heir

apparent
to
the
Shandy
family
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
from
this
point
properly
,
that
the
story
of
my
Life

my
opinion
set
out

<EOS>
with
all
my

precipitation
,
I
have

be
clear
the

to
raise
the

such
a

do
I
foresee
it

turn
out

as
never

never

<EOS>
in

I

thick

which
be
leave
remain
at
the
bottom
of
my

after
it
 
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
half
a
score
thing
to
do
in
the
time
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
thing
to
name
 
a
thing
to
lament
 
a
thing
to
hope
 
a
thing
to
promise
,
and
a
thing
to
threaten
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
thing
to
suppose
 
a
thing
to
declare
 
a
thing
to
conceal
 
a
thing
to
choose
,
and
a
thing
to
pray
for
  
this
chapter
<EOS>
,
therefore
,
I
name
the
chapter
of
thing
 
and
my
next
chapter
to
it
,
that
is
,
the
first
chapter
of
my
next
volume
,
if
I
live
,
shall
be
my
chapter
upon
Whiskers
,
in
order
to
keep
up
some
sort
of
connection
in
my
work
.
  
<EOS>
the
thing
I
lament
be
,
that
thing
have
crowd
in
so
thick
upon
me
,
that
I
have
not
be
able
to
get
into
that
part
of
my
work
,
towards
which
I
have
all
the
way
look
forwards
,
with
so
much
earnest
desire
;
and
that
be
the
Campaigns
,
but
especially
the
amour
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
the
event
of
which
be
of
so
singular
a
nature
,
and
so
Cervantick
a
cast
,
that
if
I
can
so
manage
it
,
as
to
convey
but
the
same
impression
to
every
other
brain
,
which
the
occurrence
themselves
excite
in
my
own
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
it
<EOS>
the
book
shall
make
its
way
in
the
world
,
much
well
than
its
master
have
do
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
oh
Tristram

<EOS>
Tristram
!
<EOS>
can
this
but
be
once
bring
about
 
the
credit
,
which
will
attend
thee
as
an
author
,
shall
counterbalance
the
many
evil
will
have
befall
thee
as
a
man
 
thou
wilt
feast
upon
the
one
 
when
thou
hast
lose
all
sense
and
remembrance
of
the
other
!
    
<EOS>
no
wonder
I
itch
so
much
as
I
do
,
to
get
at
these
amour
 
<EOS>
They
be
the
choice
morsel
of
my
whole
story
!
<EOS>
and
when
I
do
get
at
'em
 
assure
yourself
,
good
folk
 
<EOS>
(
nor
do
I
value
whose
squeamish
stomach
take
offence
at
it
)
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
at
all
nice
in
the
choice
of
my
word
!
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
thing
I
have
to
declare
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
all
through
in
five
minute
,
<EOS>
that
I
fear
 
and
the
thing
I
hope
be
,
that
your
worship
and
reverence
be
not
offend
 
if
you
be

depend
upon't
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
something

my

<EOS>
next

to
be

at
 
<EOS>
that
be

which
be

which
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
three
volume
 
<EOS>
the
thing
I
have
to

how
you

your

<EOS>
my

<EOS>
as
for
your

I

,
they
be

<EOS>
True
Shandeism

think
what
you
will
against
it
,
open
the
heart
and
lung
,
and
like
all
those
affection
which
partake
of
its
nature
,
it
force
the
blood
and
other
vital
fluid
of
the

to
run
freely
through
its
channel
,
make
the
wheel
of

run
long

cheerfully
round

<EOS>
be
I
leave
,
like
Sancho
Panca
,
to
choose
my
kingdom
,
it
should
not
be
maritime
 
or
a
kingdom
of
black
to
make
a
penny
of
;
 
no
,
it
should
be
a
kingdom
of
hearty
laughing
subject
:
 
<EOS>
and
as
the
bilious
and
more
saturnine
passion
,
by
create
disorder
in
the
blood
and
humour
,
have
as
bad
an
influence
,
I
see
,
upon
the
body
politick
as
body
natural
 
and
as
nothing
but
a
habit
of
virtue
can
fully
govern
those
passion
,
and
subject
them
to
reason
 
I
should
add
to
my
prayer
 
that
God
would
give
my
subject
grace
to
be
as
wise
as
they
be
Merry
;
and
then
should
I
be
the
happy
monarch

they
be
the
happy
people

so
with

till

my

who
have
a
map
of
Sanson

,
and
a
book
of
the
post

road
before
him

have
keep
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
his
compass
,
with
one
foot
of
them
fix
upon
never
,
the
last
stage
he
have
pay
for
  
purpose
to
go
on
from
that
point
with
his
journey
and
calculation
,
as
soon
as
Obadiah
quit
the
room

this
second
attack
of
Obadiah

,
in
open
the
door
and
lay
the
whole
country
under
water
,
be
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
He
let
go
his
compass
 
or
rather
with
a
mixed
motion
between
accident
and
anger
,
he
throw
them
upon
the
table
;
and
then
there
be
nothing
for
him
to
do
,
but
to
return
back
to
Calais
(
like
many
other
)
as
wise
as
he
have
set
out

<EOS>
when

have
get
forwards
again
upon
his
journey

within
a
stride
of

of
the
very

stage
of
never

<EOS>
by
your

<EOS>
Sanson
,
cry
my

,
strike
the
point
of
his

through

into
the
table
 
and
nod
to
my
uncle
Toby
to
see
what
be
in
the
letter
 
twice
of
one
night
,
be
too
much
for
an

his

Mons

<EOS>
Sanson
,
to
be
turn
back
from
so
lousy
a

Nevers
  
<EOS>
what
think'st
thou

Toby

<EOS>
add
my

in
a
sprightly
tone

<EOS>
unless
it

<EOS>
my

for
then
 
I

say
my

smile
to
himself
,
as
long
as
I
live

<EOS>
so
give
a
second
nod
  
and
keep
his
compass
still
upon
never
with
one
hand
,
and
hold
his
book
of

in
the

half
listening

Will

at

unto

look
into
the

of

and
consider
how
many
excellent
thing
may
be

no
body
upon

can
conceive
,
say
the
great
orator
,
how
happy
,
how
joyful
it
make
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
as
proud
of
his
eloquence
as
Marcus
Tullius
Cicero
could
be
for
his
life
,
and
,
for
aught
I
be
convince
of
to
the
contrary
at
present
,
with
as
much
reason
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
indeed
his
strength
 
and
his
weakness
too

<EOS>
His
strength

his
weakness
 
for
<EOS>
he
be
hourly
a
dupe

and
,
provide
an
occasion
in
life
<EOS>
would
but
permit
him
to
shew
his
talent
,
or
say
either
a
wise
thing

witty
,
or
a
shrewd
one
  
(
bate
the
case
of
a
systematic
misfortune
)
 
<EOS>
he
have
all
he
want

<EOS>
a
blessing
which
tie
up
my

tongue

a
misfortune
which
let
it
loose

be
pretty
equal
:
 
sometimes

indeed
,
the
misfortune
be
the
well
of

where
the
pleasure
of
the
harangue
be

ten

the
pain
of
the
misfortune
<EOS>

as
five
 
my

gain
half

,
and
consequently
be
as
well
again
off
,
as
if
it
have
never
befall
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
clue
will
unravel
what
otherwise
would
seem
very
inconsistent
in
my
father
's
domestic
character
;
and
it
be
this
,
that
,
in
the
provocation
arise
from
the
neglect
and
blunder
of
servant
,
or
other
mishap
unavoidable
in
a

his
anger

rather
the
duration
of
it

counter

all
conjecture

My

have
a
favourite
little
mare

which
he
have
consign
over
to
a

beautiful
arabian
horse

in
order
to
have
a
pad
out
of
her
for
his
own
riding
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
sanguine
in
all
his
project
;
so
talk
about
his
pad
every
day
with
as
absolute
a
security
,
as
if
it
have
be
rear
,
broke
,
 
and
bridle
and

at

ready
for
mount

some
neglect
or
other
in

out

my

pronounce
the

<EOS>
'
Tis
a
shrill
penetrating
sound
of
itself
,
and
Obadiah
have
help
it
by
leave
the
door
a
little
a
-
jar
,
so
that
my
mother
hear
enough
of
it
to
imagine
herself
the
subject
of
the
conversation
;
so
lay
the
edge
of
her
finger
across
her
two
lip
 
<EOS>
hold
in
her
breath
,
and
bend
her
head
a
little
downward
,
with
a
twist
of
her
neck
 
(
not
towards
the
door
,
but
from
it
,
by
which
mean
her
ear
be
bring
to
the
chink

<EOS>
she
listen
with
all
her
power
:
 
<EOS>
the
listening
slave
,
with
the
Goddess
of
Silence
at
his
back
,
could
not
have
give
a
fine
thought
for
an
intaglio
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
attitude
I
be
determined
to
let
her
stand
for
five
minute
:
 
<EOS>
till
I
bring
up
the
affair
of
the
kitchen
(
as
Rapin
do
those
of
the
church
)
to
the
same
period

<EOS>
Though
in
one
sense
,
our
family
be
certainly
a
simple
machine
,
as
it
consist
of
a
few
wheel
;
yet
there
be
thus
much
to
be
say
for
it
,
that
these
wheel
be
set
in
motion
by
so
many
different
spring
,
and
act
one
upon
the
other
from
such
a
variety
of
strange
principle
and
impulse
 
that
though
it
be
a
simple
machine
,
it
have
all
the
honour
and
advantage
of
a
complex
one
,
 
and
a
number
of
as
odd
movement
within
it
,
as
ever
be
behold
in
the
inside
of
a
dutch
silk

mill

<EOS>
amongst
these
there
be
one
,
I
be
go
to
speak
of
,
in
which
,
perhaps
,
it
be
not
altogether
so
singular
,
as
in
many
other
;
and
it
be
this
,
that
whatever
motion
,
debate
,
harangue
,
dialogue
,
project

or
dissertation
,
be
go
forwards
in

there
be
generally
another

upon
the
same
subject

run
parallel
along
with
it
in
the
kitchen

<EOS>
now
to
bring
this
about
,
whenever
an
extraordinary
message

letter
,
be
deliver
in

a
discourse
suspend
till
a

go
out

of
the
many
reason
why

<EOS>
it
be
not
difficult
to
manage

by
which
mean
,
in
all
these
case
,
a
passage
be
generally
leave

not
indeed
as
wide
as
the
Dardanelles

wide
enough

for

to
carry

much
of

windward
trade

be
sufficient
to
save
my

of
the
corporal
's
eloquence
 
<EOS>
I
do
demand
your
attention
 
your
worship
and
reverence
,
for
any
ten
page
together
,
take
them
where
you
will
in
any
other
part
of
the
work
,
<EOS>
shall
sleep
for
it
at
your
ease
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
we
be
not
stock
and
stone
"
 
'
tis
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
add
,
nor
be
we
angel
<EOS>
,
I
wish
we
be
,
 
but
man
clothe
with
body
,
and
govern
by
our
imagination
;
 
and
what
a
junket
piece
of
work
of
it
<EOS>
there
be
,
betwixt
these
and
our
seven
sense
,
especially
some
of
them
,
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
own
it
,
I
be
ashamed
to
confess
.
 
<EOS>
let
it
suffice
to
affirm
,
that
of
all
the
sense
,
the
eye
(
for
I
absolutely
deny
the
touch
,
though
most
of
your
Barbati
,
I
know
,
be
for
it
)
have
the
quick
commerce
with
the
soul
,
 
give
a
smart
stroke
,
and
leave
something
more
inexpressible
upon
the
fancy
,
than
word
can
either
convey
 
or
sometimes
get
rid
of
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
go
a
little
about
 
<EOS>
no
matter
,
'
tis
for
health
 
let
us
only
carry
it
back
in
our
mind
to
the
mortality
of
Trim
's
hat
 
<EOS>
"
be
we
not
here
now
,
  
and
go
in
a
moment
?
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
the
sentence
 
<EOS>
'
twas
one
of
your
self
-
evident
truth
<EOS>
we
have
the
advantage
of
hear
every
day
;
and
if
Trim
have
not
trust
more
to
his
hat
than
his
head
 
he
make
nothing
at
all
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
"
be
we
not
here
now
;
"
continue
the
corporal
,
"
and
be
we
not
"
  
(
drop
his
hat
plumb
upon
the
ground
 
and
pause
,
before
he
pronounce
the
word
)
 
<EOS>
"
go
!
<EOS>
in
a
moment
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
descent
of
the
hat
be
as
if
a
heavy
lump
of
clay
have
be
knead
into
the
crown
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
have
express
the
sentiment
of
mortality
,
of
which
it
be
the
type
and
fore-
runner
,
like
it
,
 
his
hand
seem
to
vanish
from
under
it
,
 
it
fall
dead
,
  
the
corporal
's
eye
fix
upon
it
,
as
upon
a
corpse
,
 
and
Susannah
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
now
 
ten
thousand
,
and
ten
thousand
time
ten
thousand
(
for
matter
and
motion
be
infinite
)
be
the
way
by
which
a
hat
may
be
drop
upon
the
ground
,
without
any
effect
.
 
<EOS>
have
he
fling
it
,
or
throw
it
,
or
cast
it
,
or
skim
it
,
or
squirt
it
,
or
let
it
slip
or
fall
in
any
possible
direction
under
heaven
,
 
or
in
the
good
direction
that
could
be
give
to
it
<EOS>
,
 
have
he
drop
it
like
a
goose
 
like
a
puppy
 
like
an
ass
 
or
in
do
it
,
or
even
after
he
have
do
,
have
he
look
like
a
fool
 
like
a
ninny
  
like
a
nincompoop
 
it

fail'd

the

I

a

It

amongst

I
own
myself
a
debtor
to
the

for
two
item

a
chapter
upon
chamber-
maid

,
which
,
in
the
former
part

my
work

I
promise

fully
intend
to
pay
off
this

but
some
of
your
worship

reverence
tell
me
,
that
the
two
subject
,
especially
so
connected
together
,
may
endanger
the
moral
of
the
world
,
 
<EOS>
I
pray
the
chapter
upon
chamber
-
maid
and
button

hole
may
be
forgive
me
,
 
and
that
they
will
accept
of
the
last
chapter
in
lieu
of
it
;
which
be
nothing

<EOS>
an't
please
your
reverence

a
chapter
of
chamber

maid
,
green
gown

<EOS>
Trim
take
his
hat
off
the
ground
,
 
put
it
upon
his

his
oration
upon

too

<EOS>
be

continue
Trim
,
<EOS>
look
still
at
Susannah
 
be
we
not
like
a
flower
of

a
tear
of
pride
stole
in
betwixt

every

Tis

It

what

I
could

talk
so
for
ever

cry
Susannah

<EOS>
what
be
it
!
<EOS>
(
Susannah
lay
her

upon

corruption

Susannah
take

off

<EOS>
what
you
be
 
and
he
who
hate
you
for
it
 
all
I
can
say
of
the
matter
be
 
that
he
have
either
a
pumpkin
for
his
head

a
pippin
for
his
heart
,
 
and
whenever
he
be
dissect
'

so

<EOS>
whether
Susannah

by
take
her
hand
too
suddenly
from
off
the
corporal
's
shoulder
(
by
the
whisking
about
of
her
passion
)
 
break
a
little
the
chain
of
his
reflexion
    
or
whether
the

begin
to
be
suspicious
,
he
have
get
into
the
doctor

be
talk
more

.Or
<EOS>
whether
 
for
in

such

<EOS>
a
man
of
invention

may
with
pleasure
fill
a
couple
of
page
with
supposition
 
which
of
all
these
be
the
cause
,
let
the
curious
physiologist
,
or
the
curious
any
body
determine
 
'
tis
certain
,
at

,
the
corporal
go
on
thus
with
his
harangue
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
declare
it
,
that
out
of
door
,
I
value
not
death
at
all
:
 
not
this
.
.
<EOS>
.adde
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
snap
his
finger
,
 
but
with
an
air
which
no
one
but
the
corporal
could
have
give
to
the
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
in
battle
,
I
value
death
not
this
.
.
<EOS>
.and
<EOS>
let
him
not
take
me
cowardly
,
like
poor
Joe
Gibbins
,
in
scour
his
gun
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
he
?
 
<EOS>
a
pull
of
a
trigger
 
a
push
of
a
bayonet
an
inch
this
way
or
that
 
make
the
difference
.
 
<EOS>
look
along
the
line
 
to
the
right

<EOS>
Jack

down

<EOS>
well

'
tis
worth
a

<EOS>
no

tis
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
then
Jack
be
no
bad

<EOS>
never
mind
which
,
 
we
pass
on
,
 
in
hot
pursuit
the
wound
itself
which
bring
him
be
not
feel
,
 
the
good
way
be
to
stand
up
to
him
,
 
the
man
who
fly
,
be
in
ten
time
more
danger
than
the
man
who
march
up
into
his
jaw
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
look'd
<EOS>
him
,
add
the
corporal
,
an
hundred
time
in
the
face
,
 
and
know
what
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
nothing
,
Obadiah
,
at
all
in
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
very
frightful
in
a
house
,
quoth
Obadiah
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
mind
it
myself
,
say
Jonathan
,
upon
a
coach
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
most
natural
in
bed
,
reply
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
and
could
I
escape
him
by
creep
into
the
bad
calf
's
skin
that
ever
be
make
into
a
knapsack
<EOS>
,
I
would
do
it
there
 
say
trim
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
nature
.
    
<EOS>
Nature
be
nature
,
say
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
reason
,
cry
Susannah
,
<EOS>
I
so
much
pity
<EOS>
my
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
never
get
the
well
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
pity
the
captain
the
most
of
any
one
in
the
family
,
answer
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
Madam
will
get
ease
of
heart
in
weeping
,
 
and
the
Squire
in
talk
about
it
,
  
but
my
poor
master
will
keep
it
all
in
silence
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
him
sigh
in
his
bed
for
a
whole
month
together
,
as
he
do
for
lieutenant
Le
Fever
.
 
<EOS>
an
'
please
your
honour
,
do
not
sigh
so
piteously
,
I
would
say
to
him
as
I
lay
besides
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
,
Trim
,
my
master
would
say
,
  
'
<EOS>
tis
so
melancholy
an
accident
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
it
off
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
fear
not
death
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Trim
<EOS>
,
I
fear
nothing
,
he
would
say
,
but
the
do
a
wrong
thing
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
he
would
add
,
whatever
betide
,
I
will
take
care
of
Le
Fever
's
boy
.
 
<EOS>
and
with
that
,
like
a
quieting
draught
,
his
honour
would
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
like
to
hear
Trim
's
story
about
the
captain
,
say
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
kindly
-
hearted
gentleman
,
say
Obadiah
,
as
ever
live
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
and
as
brave
a
one
too
,
say
the
corporal
,
as
ever
stept
before
a
platoon
.
 
<EOS>
there
never
be
a
well
officer
in
the
king
's
army
,
 
or
a
well
man
in
God
's
world
;
for
he
would
march
up
to
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
,
though
he
see
the
light
match
at
the
very
touch
-
hole
,
 
and
yet
,
for
all
that
,
he
have
a
heart
as
soft
as
a
child
for
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
hurt
a
chicken
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
,
quoth
Jonathan
,
drive
such
a
gentleman
for
seven
pound
a
year
  
than
some
for
eight
.
 
<EOS>
thank
thee
,
Jonathan
!
<EOS>
for
thy
twenty
shilling
,
 
as
much
,
Jonathan
,
say
the
corporal
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
as
if
thou
hadst
put
the
money
into
my
own
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
serve
him
to
the
day
of
my
death
out
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
friend
and
a
brother
to
me
,
 
and
could
I
be
sure
my
poor
brother
<EOS>
Tom
be
dead
,
 
continue
the
corporal
,
take
out
his
handkerchief
,
 
be
I
worth
ten
thousand
pound
,
I
would
leave
every
shilling
of
it
to
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
could
not
refrain
from
tear
at
this
testamentary
proof
he
give
of
his
affection
to
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
kitchen
be
affect
.
 
<EOS>
do
tell
us
the
story
of
the
poor
lieutenant
,
say
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
my
heart
,
answer
the
corporal
.
  
<EOS>
Susannah
,
the
cook
,
Jonathan
,
Obadiah
,
and
corporal
Trim
,
form
a
circle
about
the
fire
;
and
as
soon
as
the
scullion
have
shut
the
kitchen
door
,
 
the
corporal
begin
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
a
Turk
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
as
much
forget
my
mother
,
as
if
Nature
have
plaistere
me
up
,
and
set
me
down
naked
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
Nile
,
without
one
.
 
<EOS>
Your
most
obedient
servant
,
Madam
 
<EOS>
I
have
cost
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
,
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
may
answer
;
 
but
you
have
leave
a
crack
in
my
back
,
  
and
here
be
a
great
piece
fall
off
here
before
,
 
and
what
must
I
do
with
this
foot
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
reach
England
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
never
wonder
at
any
thing
;
 
and
so
often
have
my
judgment
deceive
me
in
my
life
,
that
I
always
suspect
it
,
right
or
wrong
,
 
at
least
I
be
seldom
hot
upon
cold
subject
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
this
,
I
reverence
truth
as
much
as
any
body
;
and
when
it
have
slip
us
,
if
a
man
will
but
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
go
quietly
and
search
for
it
,
as
for
a
thing
we
have
both
lose
,
and
can
neither
of
us
do
well
without
,
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
the
world
's
end
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
hate
dispute
,
 
and
therefore
(
bate
religious
point
,
or
such
as
touch
society
)
I
would
almost
subscribe
to
any
thing
which
do
not
choak
me
in
the
first
passage
,
rather
than
be
draw
into
one
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
bear
suffocation
,
 
and
bad
smell
bad
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
I
resolve
from
the
beginning
,
that
if
ever
the
army
of
martyr
be
to
be
augment
,
 
or
a
new
one
raise
,
 
I
would
have
no
hand
in
it
,
one
way
or
t'other
.
      
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
opinion
,
Madam
,
"
that
there
could
be
no
harm
in
Cornelius
Gallus
,
the
roman
praetor
be
lie
with
his
wife
;
"
 
or
rather
the
last
word
of
that
opinion
,
 
<EOS>
(
for
it
be
all
my
mother
hear
of
it
)
<EOS>
catch
hold
of
her
by
the
weak
part
of
the
whole
sex
:
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
mistake
me
,
 
<EOS>
I
mean
her
curiosity
,
 
she
instantly
conclude
herself
the
subject
of
the
conversation
,
and
with
that
prepossession
upon
her
fancy
,
you
will
readily
conceive
every
word
my
father
say
,
be
accommodate
either
to
herself
,
or
her
family
concern
.
    
<EOS>
Pray
,
Madam
,
in
what
street
do
the
lady
live
,
who
would
not
have
do
the
same
?
  
<EOS>
from
the
strange
mode
of
Cornelius
's
death
,
my
father
have
make
a
transition
to
that
of
Socrates
,
and
be
give
my
uncle
Toby
an
abstract
of
his
pleading
before
his
judge
;
 
'
twas
irresistible
:
 
not
the
oration
of
Socrates
,
 
but
my
father
's
temptation
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
write
the
Life
of
Socrates
(
this
book
my
father
would
never
consent
to
publish
;
'
tis
in
manuscript
,
with
some
other
tract
of
his
,
in
the
family
,
all
,
or
most
of
which
will
be
print
in
due
time
.
)
<EOS>
himself
the
year
before
he
leave
off
trade
,
which
,
I
fear
,
be
the
mean
of
hasten
him
out
of
it
;
 
so
that
no
one
be
able
to
set
out
with
so
full
a
sail
,
and
in
so
swell
a
tide
of
heroic
loftiness
upon
the
occasion
,
as
my
father
be
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
period
in
Socrates
's
oration
,
which
close
with
a
short
word
than
transmigration
,
or
annihilation
,
 
or
a
bad
thought
in
the
middle
of
it
than
to
be
 
or
not
to
be
,
 
the
entering
upon
a
new
and
untried
state
of
thing
,
 
or
,
upon
a
long
,
a
profound
and
peaceful
sleep
,
without
dream
,
without
disturbance
?
  
<EOS>
that
we
and
our
child
be
bear
to
die
,
 
but
neither
of
us
bear
to
be
slave
.
 
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
there
I
mistake
;
that
be
part
of
Eleazer
's
oration
,
as
record
by
Josephus
(
de
Bell
.
<EOS>
Judaic
)
 
<EOS>
Eleazer
own
he
have
it
from
the
philosopher
of
India
;
in
all
likelihood
Alexander
the
Great
,
in
his
irruption
into
India
,
after
he
have
over
-
run
Persia
,
amongst
the
many
thing
he
steal
,
 
steal
that
sentiment
also
;
by
which
mean
it
be
carry
,
<EOS>
if
not
all
the
way
by
himself
(
for
we
all
know
he
die
at
Babylon
)
,
at
least
by
some
of
his
maroder
,
into
Greece
,
 
from
Greece
it
get
to
Rome
,
 
from
Rome
to
France
,
 
and
from
France
to
England
:
 
<EOS>
so
thing
come
round
.
    
<EOS>
by
land
carriage
,
I
can
conceive
no
other
way
.
    
<EOS>
by
water
the
sentiment
may
easily
have
come
down
the
gange
into
the
Sinus
Gangeticus
,
or
Bay
of
Bengal
,
and
so
into
the
Indian
Sea
;
and
follow
the
course
of
trade
(
the
way
from
India
by
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
be
then
unknown
)
,
may
be
carry
with
other
drug
and
spice
up
the
Red
Sea
to
Joddah
,
the
port
of
Mekka
,
or
else
to
tor
or
Sues
,
town
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
;
and
from
thence
by
karrawan
to
Coptos
,
but
three
day
journey
distant
,
so
down
the
Nile
directly
to
Alexandria
,
where
the
Sentiment
would
be
land
at
the
very
foot
of
the
great
stair
-
case
of
the
alexandrian
library
,
 
and
from
that
store

house
it
would
be
fetch

<EOS>
bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
trade
be
drive
by
the
learn
in
those
day
!
      
<EOS>
now
my
father
have
a
way
,
a
little
like
that
of
Job
's
(
in
case
<EOS>
there
ever
be
such
a
man
 
<EOS>
if
not
,
there
be
an
end
of
the

<EOS>
Though
,
by

because
your

find
some
difficulty
in
fix
the
precise

so
great

live
;
 
whether
,
for

,
before

after
the
patriarch

c.

therefore
,
that
he

not

<EOS>
My
father
,
I
say
,
have
a
way
,
when
thing
go
extremely
wrong
with
him
,
especially
upon
the
first
sally
of
his
impatience
,
 
of
wonder
why
he
be
beget
,
 
wish
himself
dead
;
  
sometimes
bad
:
 
<EOS>
and
when
the
provocation
run
high
,
and
grief
touch
his
lip
with
more
than
ordinary
power
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
scarce
could
have
distinguish
him
from
Socrates
himself
.
 
<EOS>
every
word
would
breathe
the
sentiment
of
a
soul
disdain
life
,
and
careless
about
all
its
issue
;
for
which
reason
,
though
my
mother
be
a
woman
of
no
deep
reading
,
yet
the
abstract
of
Socrates
's
oration
,
which
my
father
be
give
my
uncle
Toby
,
be
not
altogether
new
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
listen
to
it
with
compose
intelligence
,
and
would
have
do
so
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
,
<EOS>
have
not
my
father
plunge
(
which
he
have
no
occasion
to
have
do
)
into
that
part
of
the
pleading
where
the
great
philosopher
reckon
up
his
connection
,
his
alliance
,
and
child
;
but
renounce
a
security
to
be
so
win
by
work
upon
the
passion
of
his
judge
.

"
I
have

I

<EOS>
I
have

say
Socrates

cry
my

open

door
<EOS>
,
 
you

my

My

upon

in

like

he
meet

He
imagine

<EOS>
My

give
himself
up
to
it

however
,
with
the
most
painful
diligence
,
proceed
step
by
step
in
every
line

with
the

kind
of
caution

circumspection
(
though
I
can
not
say
upon
quite
so
religious
a
principle
)
as
be
use
by
John
de
la
Casse
,
the
lord
archbishop
of
Benevento
,
in
compass
his
Galatea
;
in
which
his
Grace
of
Benevento
spend
near
forty
year
of
his
life
;
and
when
the
thing
come
out
,
it
be
not
of
above
half
the
size

the
thickness
of
a
Rider

<EOS>
how
the
holy
man
manage
the

unless
he
spend
the
great
part

in
comb
his
whisker
,

play
at

with
his
chaplain
,
 
would
pose
any
mortal
not
let
into
the
true
secret

and
therefore
'
tis
worth
explain
to
the

be
it
only
for
the
encouragement

those
few
in

who
write
not

to

<EOS>
I
own
have
John

the
archbishop
of
Benevento
,
for
whose
memory
(
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
Galatea

)
I
retain
the
high
veneration
,
 
have
he

Sir
,
a
slender
clerk
 
of
dull
wit
 
slow

costive

and
<EOS>
so
forth

he
and
his
Galatea
may
have
jog
on

to
the
age
of
Methuselah
for
me
,
 
the
phaenomenon
have
not
be
worth
a
parenthesis

<EOS>
but
the
reverse
of
this

the
truth

<EOS>
John
de

be
a
genius
of
fine
part

fertile
fancy
;
and
yet
with
all
these
great
advantage
of
nature

which
should
have
prick
him
forwards

his
Galatea

he
lie
under
an
impuissance
at
the

time
of
advance
above
a
line
and
a
half
in
the
compass
of
a
whole
summer
's
day
:
 
<EOS>
this
disability
in
his
grace
arise
from
an
opinion
he
be
afflict
with
,
 
<EOS>
which
opinion
be
this
,
 
viz
.
<EOS>
that
whenever
a
Christian
be
write
a
book
(
not
for
his
private
amusement
,
but
)
where
his
intent
and
purpose
be
,
bona
fide
,
to
print
and
publish
it
to
the
world
,
his
first
thought
be
always
the
temptation
of
the
evil
one
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
state
of
ordinary
writer
:
 
but
when
a
personage
of
venerable
character
and
high
station
,
either
in
church
or
state
,
once
turn
author
,
 
he
maintain
,
that
from
the
very
moment
he
take
pen
in
hand
 
all
the
devil
in
hell
break
out
of
their
hole
to
cajole
him

<EOS>
so
that
the
life
of
a
writer
,
whatever
he
may
fancy
to
the
contrary
,
be
not
so
much
a
state
of
composition
,
as
a
state
of
warfare
;
and
his
probation
in
it
,
precisely
that
of
any
other
man
militant
upon

,
 
both
depend
alike
,
not
half
so
much
upon
the
degree
of

his
Resistance

<EOS>
My
father
be
hugely
pleased
with
this
theory
of
John
de
la
Casse
,
archbishop
of
Benevento
;
and
(
have
it
not
cramp
him
a
little
in
his
creed
)
<EOS>
I
believe
would
have
give
ten
of
the
good
acre
in
the
Shandy
estate
,
to
have
be
the
broacher
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
how
far
my
father
actually
believe
in
the
devil
,
will
be
see
,
when
I
come
to
speak
of
my
father
's
religious
notion
,
in
the
progress
of
this
work
:
 
'
tis
enough
to
say
here
,
as
he
could
not
have
the
honour
of
it
,
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
doctrine
 
<EOS>
he
take
up
with
the
allegory
of
it
;
and
would
often
say
,
especially
when
his
pen
be
a
little
retrograde
,
there
be
as
much
good
meaning
,
truth
,
and
knowledge
,
couch
under
the
veil
of
John
de
la
Casse
's
parabolical
representation
,
  
as
be
to
be
find
in
any
one
poetic
fiction
or
mystic
record
of
antiquity
.
 
<EOS>
Prejudice
of
education
,
he
would
say
,
be
the
devil
,
 
and
the
multitude
of
them
which
we
suck
in
with
our
mother
's
milk
 
be
the
devil
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
haunt
with
them
,
brother
Toby
,
in
all
our
lucubration
and
research
;
and
be
a
man
fool
enough
to
submit
tamely
to
what
they
obtrude
upon
him
,
 
what
would
his
book
be
?
 
<EOS>
nothing
,
 
he
would
add
,
throw
his
pen
away
with
a
vengeance
,
 
nothing
but
a
farrago
of
the
clack
of
nurse
,
and
of
the
nonsense
of
the
old
woman
(
of
both
sex
)
throughout
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
good
account
I
be
determined
to
give
of
the
slow
progress
my
father
make
in
his
Tristra
-
paedia
;
at
which
(
as
I
say
)
<EOS>
he
be
three
year
,
and
something
more
,
indefatigably
at
work
,
and
,
at
last
,
have
scarce
complete
,
by
this
own
reckoning
,
one
half
of
his
undertaking
:
 
<EOS>
the
misfortune
be
,
that
I
be
all
that
time
totally
neglect
and
abandon
to
my
mother
;
and
what
be
almost
as
bad
,
by
the
very
delay
,
the
first
part
of
the
work
,
upon
which
my
father
have
spend
the
most
of
his
pain
,
be
render
entirely
useless
,
 
every
day
a
page
or
two
become
of
no
consequence
.
      
<EOS>
certainly
it
be
ordain
as
a
scourge
upon
the
pride
of
human
wisdom
,
that
the
wise
of
us
all
should
thus
outwit
ourselves
,
and
eternally
forego
our
purpose
in
the
intemperate
act
of
pursue
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
my
father
be
so
long
in
all
his
act
of
resistance
,
 
or
in
other
word
,
 
he
advance
so
very
slow
with
his
work
,
and
I
begin
to
live
and
get
forwards
at
such
a
rate
,
that
if
an
event
have
not
happen
,
 
which
,
when
we
get
to
it
,
if
it
can
be
tell
with
decency

shall
not
be
conceal
a
moment
from
the

<EOS>
I
verily
believe
,
I
have
put
by
my
father
,
and
leave
him
draw
a
sundial

for
no
well
purpose

to
be
bury

him
he
be

much
to
blame
as
Susannah

if
the
doctrine
have
be
true
,
my
uncle
Toby
have
as
much
of
the
bloodshed
to
answer
for
to
heaven

either

rest
with
his
hand
upon
the
corporal
's
shoulder
,
as
they
both
stand
survey
their
work
,
 
that
we
have
not
a
couple
of
field
-
piece
to
mount
in
the
gorge
of
that
new
redoubt
;
 
'
twould
secure
the
line
all
along
there

make
the
attack
on

side
quite
complete
:
 
get
me
a

Your

It

nor
be
his

ever

to

my

Toby
in

with
whatever
his
fancy
call
for

have
it

he
would
have
sate
down

hammer
it
into
a
paderero

to
have
prevent
a

wish
in
his

<EOS>
the
corporal
have
already
,
 
what
with
cut
off
the
end
of
my

Toby
's
spout
 
hack
and
chisel
up
the
side
of
his
leaden
gutter
,
 
melt
down
his
pewter
shaving

bason
,
 
and
go
at
last
,
like
Lewis
the
Fourteenth
,
on
to
the
top
of
the
church
,
for
spare
end
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
he
have
that
very
campaign
bring
no
less
than
eight
new
batter
cannon
,
besides
three
demi
-
culverin
,
into
the
field
;
my
uncle
Toby
's
demand
for
two
more
piece
for
the
redoubt
,
have
set
the
corporal
at
work
again
;
and
no
well
resource
offering
,
he
have
take
the
two
leaden
weight
from
the
nursery
window
:
 
and
as
the
sash
pullie
,
when
the
lead
be
go
,
be
of
no
kind
of
use
,
he
have
take
them
away
also
,
to
make
a
couple
of
wheel
for
one
of
their
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
dismantle
every
sash

window
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
long
before
,
in
the
very

way
,
 
though
not
always
in
the
same
order
;
for
sometimes
the
pullie
have
be
want
,
and
not
the
lead
,
 
so
then
he
begin
with
the
pullie
,
 
and
the
pullie
be
pick
out
,
then
the
lead
become
useless
,
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
lead
go
to
pot
too
.
    
<EOS>
a
great
Moral
may
be
pick
handsomely
out
of
this
,
but
I
have
not
time
 
'
tis
enough
to
say
,
wherever
the
demolition
begin
,
'
twas
equally
fatal
to
the
sash
window
.
    
<EOS>
the
corporal
have
not
take
his
measure
so
badly
in
this
stroke
of
artilleryship
,
but
that
he
may
have
keep
the
matter
entirely
to
himself
,
and
leave
Susannah
to
have
sustain
the
whole
weight
of
the
attack
,
as
she
could
;
 
true
courage
be
not
content
with
come
off
so
.
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
whether
as
general
or
comptroller
of
the
train

no

have
do
that

without
which

as
he
imagine

the
misfortune
could
never
have
happen
,
 
at

in
Susannah
's
hand
;
 
how
would
your
honour
have
behave
?
 
<EOS>
He
determine
at
once
,
not
to
take
shelter
behind
Susannah
,
 
but
to
give
it
;
and
with
this
resolution
upon
his
mind
,
he
march
upright
into
the
parlour
,
to
lay
the
whole
manoeuvre
before
my
uncle
Toby

the
foot
to
halt

the

to
march
where
it
could
not

which

contrary

they

there

and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
my
uncle
Toby
sink
his
voice
a
note
,
 
resume
the
discourse
as
follow
.
    
<EOS>
King
William
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
address
himself
to
Yorick
,
be
so
terribly
provoke
at
count
solme
for
disobey
his
order
,
that
he
would
not
suffer
him
to
come
into
his
presence
for
many
month
after
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
answer
Yorick
,
the
squire
will
be
as
much
provoke
at
the
corporal
,
as
the
King
at
the
count
.
 
<EOS>
but
"
twould
be
singularly
hard
in
this
case
,
continue
be
,
<EOS>
if
corporal
Trim
,
who
have
behave
so
diametrically
opposite
to
count
solme
,
should
have
the
fate
to
be
reward
with
the
same
disgrace
:
 
too
oft
in
this
world
,
do
thing
take
that
train
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
spring
a
mine
,
cry
my
uncle
Toby
,
rise
up
,
 
and
blow
up
my
fortification
,
and
my
house
with
them
,
and
we
would
perish
under
their
ruin
,
ere
I
would
stand
by
and
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
direct
a
slight
,
 
but
a
grateful
bow
towards
his
master
,
 
<EOS>
and
so
the
chapter
end
.
      
<EOS>
then
,
Yorick
,
reply
my
uncle
Toby
,
you
and
I
will
lead
the
way
abreast
,
 
and
do
you
,
corporal
,
follow
a
few
pace
behind
us
.
 
<EOS>
and
Susannah
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
say
Trim
,
shall
be
put
in
the
rear

<EOS>
'
Twas
an
excellent
disposition
,
 
and
in
this
order
,
without
either
drum
beat
,
or
colour
fly
,
they
march
slowly
from
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
to
Shandy
-
hall
.
    
<EOS>
I
wish
,
say
Trim
,
as
they
enter
the
door
,
 
instead
of
the
sash
weight
,
I
have
cut
off
the
church
spout
,
as
I
once
think
to
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
cut
off
spout
enow
,
reply
Yorick
.
    
<EOS>
as
many
picture
as
have
be
give
of
my
father
,
how
like
him
soever
in
different
air
and
attitude
,
 
not
one
,
or
all
of
them
<EOS>
,
can
ever
help
the
reader
to
any
kind
of
preconception
of
how
my
father
would
think
,
speak
,
or
act
,
upon
any
untried
occasion
or
occurrence
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
that
infinitude
of
oddity
in
him
,
and
of
chance
along
with
it
,
by
which
handle
he
would
take
a
thing
,
 
it
baffle
,
Sir
,
all
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
his
road
lie
so
very
far
on
one
side
,
from
that
wherein
most
man
travel
,
 
that
every
object
before
him
present
a
face
and
section
of
itself
to
his
eye
,
altogether
different
from
the
plan
and
elevation
of
it
see
by
the
rest
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
'
twa
a
different
object
,
and
in
course
be
differently
consider
:
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
true
reason
,
that
my
dear
Jenny
and
I
,
as
well
as
all
the
world
besides
us
,
have
such
eternal
squabble
about
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
at
her
outside
,
 
<EOS>
I
,
at
her
in

.
..
 
<EOS>
how
be
it
possible
we
should
agree
about
her
value
?
    
<EOS>
@@@ti
a
point
settle
,
 
and
I
mention
it
for
the
comfort
of
Confucius
,
<EOS>
(
Mr
Shandy
be
suppose
to
mean

Esq

member

not

<EOS>
who

he
may
go
backwards

forwards

he
will
,
 
'
tis
still
hold
to
be
no
digression

<EOS>
this
be
premise
,
I
take
the
benefit
of
the
act
of
go
backwards
myself
.
    
<EOS>
fifty
thousand
panni
load
of
devil
 
(
not
of
the
Archbishop
of
Benevento

<EOS>
I
mean
of
Rabelais
's
devil
)
,
<EOS>
with
their
tail
chop
off
by
their
rump
,
could
not
have
make
so
diabolical
a
scream
of
it
,
as
I
do
  
when
the
accident
befel
me
:
 
<EOS>
it
summon
up
my
mother
instantly
into
the
nursery
,
 
so
that
Susannah
have
but
just
time
to
make
her
escape
down
the
back
stair
,
as
my
mother
come
up
the
fore
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
though
I
be
old
enough
to
have
tell
the
story
myself
,
 
and
young
enough
,
I
hope
,
to
have
do
it
without
malignity
;
yet
Susannah
,
in
pass
by
the
kitchen
,
for
fear
of
accident
,
have
leave
it
in
short
-
hand
with
the
cook
 
the
cook
have
tell
it
with
a
commentary
to
Jonathan
,
and
Jonathan
to
Obadiah
;
so
that
by
the
time
my
father
have
ring
the
bell
half
a
dozen
time
,
to
know
what
be
the
matter
above
,
 
<EOS>
be
Obadiah
enable
to
give
him
a
particular
account
of
it
,
just
as
it
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
as
much
,
say
my
father
,
tuck
up
his
night
-
gown
;
 
and
so
walk
up
stair
.
  
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
from
this
 
(
though
for
my
own
part
I
somewhat
question
it
)
 
that
my
father
,
before
that
time
,
have
actually
write
that
remarkable
character
in
the
Tristra
-
paedia
,
which
to
me
be
the
most
original
and
entertain
one
in
the
whole
book
;
 
and
that
be
the
chapter
upon
sash-
window
,
with
a
bitter
philippick
at
the
end
of
it
,
upon
the
forgetfulness
of
chamber
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
two
reason
for
think
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
have
the
matter
be
take
into
consideration
,
before
the
event
happen
,
my
father
certainly
would
have
nail
up
the
sash
window
for
good
an
'
all
;
 
which
,
consider
with
what
difficulty
he
compose
book
,
 
he
may
have
do
with
ten
time
less
trouble
,
than
he
could
have
write
the
chapter
:
 
<EOS>
this
argument
I
foresee
hold
good
against
his
writing
a
chapter
,
even
after
the
event
;
but
'
tis
obviate
under
the
second
reason
,
which
I
have
the
honour
to
offer
to
the
world
in
support
of
my
opinion
,
that
my
father
do
not
write
the
chapter
upon
sash
-
window
and
chamber
-
pot
,
at
the
time
suppose
,
 
and
it
be
this
.
    
<EOS>
that
,
in
order
to
render
the
Tristra
-
paedia
complete
,
 
I
write
the
chapter
myself
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
put
on
his
spectacle
 
<EOS>
look
,
 
take
them
off
,
 
put
them
into
the
case
 
all
in
less
than
a
statutable
minute
;
and
without
open
his
lip
,
turn
about
and
walk
precipitately
down
stair
:
 
<EOS>
my
mother
imagine
he
have
step
down
for
lint
and
basilicon
;
but
see
him
return
with
a
couple
of
folio
under
his
arm
,
and
Obadiah
follow
him
with
a
large
reading
-
desk
,
she
take
it
for
grant
'
twas
an
herbal
,
and
so
draw
him
a
chair
to
the
bedside
,
that
he
may
consult
upon
the
case
at
his
ease
.
    
<EOS>
if
it
be
but
right
do
,
 
say
my
father
,
turn
to
the
Section
 
de
sede
vel
subjecto
circumcisionis
,
 
for
he
have
bring
up
Spenser
de
Legibus
Hebraeorum
<EOS>
Ritualibus
 
and
Maimonides
,
in
order
to
confront
and
examine
us
altogether
.
      
<EOS>
if
it
be
but
right
do
,
quoth
<EOS>
he
:
 
<EOS>
only
tell
us
,
cry
my
mother
,
interrupt
him
,
what
herb
?
 
<EOS>
for
that
,
reply
my
father
,
you
must
send
for
Dr.
Slop
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
go
down
,
and
my
father
go
on
,
read
the
section
as
follow
,
  
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
,
 
say
my
father
,
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
nay
,
if
it
have
that
convenience
  
and
so
without
stop
a
moment
to
settle
it
first
in
his
mind
,
whether
the
Jews
have
it
from
the
Egyptians
,
or
the
Egyptians
from
the
Jews
,
 
he
rise
up
,
and
rub
his
forehead
two
or
three
time
across
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
in
the
manner
we
rub
out
the
footstep
of
care
,
when
evil
have
trod
light
upon
us
than
we
forebode
<EOS>
,
 
he
shut
the
book
,
and
walk
down
stair
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
say
he
,
mention
the
name
of
a
different
great
nation
upon
every
step
as
he
set
his
foot
upon
it
 
if
the
Egyptians

Phoenicians

the
Arabians

what

the

assign

our

I

Gymnast

very
well
remark
and
consider
;

make
as
if
he
would
have
alight
from
off
his

himself
on

he
most
nimbly
(
with
his
short
sword
by
this
thigh

shift
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
and
perform
the
stirrup

leather
feat
,
whereby
,
after
the
inclining
of
his
body
downwards

he
forthwith
launch
himself
aloft
into

both

then
suddenly
in

a

to
the

fail
not
to
carry
his

perfectly
round

just
into
his
former
position

without

one

well
,

I

undo
this

strength

agility
,
turn
towards

he
fetch
another

gambol
as
before

he
set

raise
himself
up

spring
into

poising
and
uphold
his
whole
weight
upon
the
muscle

nerve
of
the

so
turn
and
whirl
himself
about
three
time

at
the
fourth
,
reverse
his
body
,
and
overturn
it
upside
down
,

without

he
bring
himself

himself
a

he
seat
himself

I

it
a

unfriendly
in

My

<EOS>
(

upon
political

the

natural
,
say

<EOS>
the
original
of
society
,
continue
my
father
,
I
be
satisfied
be
,
what
Politian
tell
us
,
i.
e.
merely
conjugal
;
and
nothing
more
than
the
get
together
of
one
man
and
one
woman
;
 
to
which
,
(
accord
to
Hesiod
)
<EOS>
the
philosopher
add
a
servant
:
 
but
suppose
in
the
first
beginning
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
servant
bear
 
<EOS>
he
lay
the
foundation
of
it
,
in
a
man
,
 
a
woman
 
and
a
bull
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
'
tis
<EOS>
an
ox
,
quoth
Yorick
,
quote
the
passage
(
Greek
)
 
<EOS>
a
bull
must
have
give
more
trouble
than
his
head
be
worth
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
well
reason
still
,
say
my
father
(
dip
his
pen
into
his
ink
)
;
for
the
ox
be
the
most
patient
of
animal
,
and
the
most
useful
withal
in
till
the
ground
for
their
nourishment
,
 
be
the
proper
instrument
,
and
emblem
too
,
for
the
new
join
couple
,
that
the
creation
could
have
associate
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
strong
reason
,
add
my
uncle
Toby
,
than
them
all
for
the
ox
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
have
not
power
to
take

out

horn
,
till
he

hear
my

reason

<EOS>
for
when
the
ground
be
till
,
say
my

Toby
,
and
make
worth
inclose
,
then
they
begin
to
secure
it
by

which
be
the
origin
of
fortification

<EOS>
true
,
true
,
dear
Toby
,
cry
my

strike
out
the
bull
,

put
the
ox
in
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
give
Trim
a
nod
,
to
snuff
the
candle
,
and
resume
his
discourse
.
    
<EOS>
I
enter
upon
this
speculation
,
say
my
father
carelessly
,
and
half
shut
the
book
,
as
he
go
on
,
merely
to
shew
the
foundation
of
the
natural
relation
between
a
father
and
his
child
;
the
right
and
jurisdiction
over
whom
he
acquire
these
several
way
  
1st
,
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
2d
,
by
adoption
.
<EOS>
3d
,
by
legitimation
.
<EOS>
and
4th
,
by
procreation
;
all
which
I
consider
in
their
order
.
  
<EOS>
I
lie
a
slight
stress
upon
one
of
them
,
reply
Yorick
 
<EOS>
the
act
,
especially
where
it
end
there
,
in
my
opinion
lay
as
little
obligation
upon
the
child
,
as
it
convey
power
to
the
father
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
wrong
,
 
say
my
father
argutely
,
and
for
this
plain
reason
.
.
<EOS>
..
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
add
my
father
,
that
the
offspring
,
upon
this
account
,
be
not
so
under
the
power
and
jurisdiction
of
the
mother
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
reason
,
reply
Yorick
,
equally
hold
good
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
under
authority
herself
,
say
my
father
:
 
and
besides
,
continue
my
father
,
nod
his
head
,
and
lay
his
finger
upon
the
side
of
his
nose
,
as
he
assign
his
reason
,
 
she
be
not
the
principal
agent

Yorick

<EOS>
in
what
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
?
<EOS>
stop
his
pipe

add
my

(
not

,
"
the

ought
to
pay
her
respect

You

out

thou

thee

want
every

<EOS>
I
have
concentrate
all
that
can
be

upon
this
important
head

say
my

into
a
very
little
room
,
therefore
we
will
read
the
chapter
quite
through

<EOS>
My
father
read
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
the
whole
secret
of
health
depend
upon
the
due
contention
for
mastery
betwixt

the

<EOS>
You

prove
that
matter

this

this

to

this

<EOS>
what
my

have
to
say
to
my

opiate

his

my

<EOS>
I

get
forwards
 
<EOS>
You

read
the
chapter
at
your
leisure
(
if
you
chuse
it
)
,
as
soon
as
ever

Tristra

<EOS>
Sufficeth
it
<EOS>
,
at
present
to
say
,
my
father
level
the
hypothesis
with
the
ground
,
and
in
do
that
,
the
learn
know
,
he
build
up
and
establish
his
own
.
      
<EOS>
the
whole
secret
of
health
,
say
my
father
,
begin
the
sentence
again
,
depend
evidently
upon
the
due
contention
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
within
us
;
 
<EOS>
the
least
imaginable
skill
have
be
sufficient
to
have
maintain
it
,
have
not
the
school
-
man
confound
the
task
,
merely
(
as
Van
Helmont
,
the
famous
chymist
,
have
prove
)
by
all
along
mistake
the
radical
moisture
for
the
tallow
and
fat
of
animal
body
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
radical
moisture
be
not
the
tallow
or
fat
of
animal
,
but
an
oily
and
balsamous
substance
;
for
the
fat
and
tallow
,
as
also
the
phlegm
or
watery
part
,
be
cold
;
whereas
the
oily
and
balsamous
part
be
of
a
lively
heat
and
spirit
,
which
account
for
the
observation
of
Aristotle
,
"
<EOS>
quod
omne
animal
post
coitum
est
triste
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
certain
,
that
the
radical
heat
live
in
the
radical
moisture
,
but
whether
vice
versa
,
be
a
doubt
:
 
however
,
when
the
one
decay
,
the
other
decay
also
;
and
then
be
produce
,
either
an
unnatural
heat
,
which
cause
an
unnatural
dryness
 
or
an
unnatural
moisture
,
which
cause
dropsy
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
if
a
child
,
as
he
grow
up
,
can
but
be
teach
to
avoid
run
into
fire
or
water
,
as
either
of
'em
threaten
his
destruction
,
 
'
twill
be
all
that
be
needful
to
be
do
upon
that
head
.
      
<EOS>
the
description
of
the
siege
of
Jericho
itself
,
could
not
have
engage
the
attention
of
my
uncle
Toby
more
powerfully
than
the
last
chapter
;
 
his
eye
be
fix
upon
my
father
throughout
it
;
 
he
never
mention
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
,
but
my
uncle
Toby
take
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
shake
his
head
;
and
as
soon
as
the
chapter
be
finish
,
he
beckon
to
the
corporal
to
come
close
to
his
chair
,
to
ask
him
the
following
question

aside
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
..
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
the
siege
of
Limerick
,
an

make
a
bow
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
and
I

quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
address
himself
to
my

be
scarce
able
to
crawl
out
of
our
tent
,
at
the
time
the
siege
of
Limerick
be
raise
,
upon
the
very
account
you
mention

<EOS>
now
what
can
have
get
into
that
precious
noddle
of
thine
,
my
dear
brother
Toby
?
<EOS>
cry
my
father
,
mentally
.
 
<EOS>
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
continue
he
,
commune
still
with
himself
,
it
would
puzzle
an
Oedipus
to
bring
it
in
point
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
that
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
quantity
of
brandy
we
set
fire
to
every
night
,
and
the
claret
and
cinnamon
with
which
I
ply
your
honour
off
;
 
and
the
geneva
,
Trim
,
add
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
do
us
more
good
than
all
 
<EOS>
I
verily
believe
,
continue
the
corporal
,
we
have
both
,
an

leave
our
life
in
the
trench

the
noble
grave

corporal

<EOS>
cry
my
uncle
Toby
,
his
eye
sparkle
as
he
speak
,
that
a
soldier
could
wish
to
lie
down
in

<EOS>
but
a
pitiful
death
for
him
!
<EOS>
an
'
please
your
honour

reply
the
corporal
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
as
much
Arabick
to
my
father
,
as
the
rite
of
the
Colchi
and
Troglodites
have
be
before
to
my
uncle
Toby
;
my
father
could
not
determine
whether
he
be
to
frown
or
to
smile
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
turn
to
Yorick
,
resume
the
case
at
Limerick
,
more
intelligibly
than
he
have
begin
it
,
 
and
so
settle
the
point
for
my
father
at
once
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
undoubtedly
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
a
great
happiness
for
myself
and
the
corporal
,
that
we
have
all
along
a
burn
fever
,
attend
with
a
most
rage
thirst
,
during
the
whole
five

and
-
twenty
day
the
flux
be
upon
us
in
the
camp
;
otherwise
what
my
brother
call
the
radical
moisture
,
must
,
as
I
conceive
it
,
inevitably
have
get
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
draw
in
his
lung
top
-
full
of
air
,
and
look
up
,
blow
it
forth
again
,
as
slowly
as
he
possibly
could
.
      
<EOS>
It
be
Heaven
's
mercy
to
us
,
continue
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
put
it
into
the
corporal
's
head
to
maintain
that
due
contention
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
,
by
reinforce
the
fever
,
as
he
do
all
along
,
with
hot
wine
and
spice
;
whereby
the
corporal
keep
up
(
as
it
be
)
a
continual
firing
,
so
that
the
radical
heat
stand
its
ground
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
and
be
a
fair
match
for
the
moisture
,
terrible
as
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
honour
,
add
my
uncle
Toby
,
you
may
have
hear
the
contention
within
our
body

Shandy

twenty

there

my

dry

<EOS>
round

off

be
that
enough
,
for
those
who
could
afford
it

as
his

could
,
without
set
fire
every

to
a
pewter
dish
full
of
brandy

which
take
off

make
the

what
conclusion
dost
thou
draw
,
corporal

cry
my

from
all
these
premise

<EOS>
I
infer
,
an
'

reply
Trim
,
that
the
radical
moisture
be
nothing
in

that
the

of

us
spirit

drive
away
the

<EOS>

it

I

It

<EOS>
the

It

inherent

principally
in

have
the

that

very

Doctor

Forty-

Peter

the
law
so
late
in

that
every
body
imagine
he
intend
to
be
an
advocate
in

when
Eudamidas

hear
xenocrate

concern
wisdom

what
time
will
he
have
to
make
use
of
it
?
  
<EOS>
Yorick
listen
to
my
father
with
great
attention
;
there
be
a
seasoning
of
wisdom
unaccountably
mix
up
with
his
strange
whim
,
and
he
have
sometimes
such
illumination
in
the
dark
of
his
eclipse
,
as
almost
atoned
for
them
:
 
be
wary
,
Sir
,
when
you
imitate
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
,
Yorick
,
continue
my
father
,
half
reading
and
half
discoursing
,
that
there
be
a
North
-
west
passage
to
the
intellectual
world
;
and
that
the
soul
of
man
have
short
way
of
go
to
work
,
in
furnish
itself
with
knowledge
and
instruction
,
than
we
generally
take
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
alack
!
<EOS>
all
field
have
not
a
river
or
a
spring
run
besides
them
;
  
every
child
,
Yorick
,
have
not
a
parent
to
point
it
out
.
    
<EOS>
the
whole
entirely
depend
,
add
my
father
,
in
a
low
voice
,
upon
the
auxiliary
verb
,
Mr.
Yorick
.
  
<EOS>
have
yorick
trod
upon
Virgil
's
snake
,
he
could
not
have
look
more
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
too
,
cry
my
father
,
observe
it
,
 
and
I
reckon
it
as
one
of
the
great
calamity
which
ever
befel
the
republic
of
letter
,
<EOS>
that
those
who
have
be
entrust
with
the
education
of
our
child
,
and
whose
business
it
be
to
open
their
mind
,
and
stock
them
early
with
idea
,
in
order
to
set
the
imagination
loose
upon
them
,
have
make
so
little
use
of
the
auxiliary
verb
in
do
it
,
as
they
have
do
  
<EOS>
so
that
,
except
Raymond
Lullius
,
and
the
eld
Pelegrini
,
the
last
of
which
arrive
to
such
perfection
in
the
use
of
'em
,
with
his
topic
,
that
,
in
a
few
lesson
,
he
could
teach
a
young
gentleman
to
discourse
with
plausibility
upon
any
subject
,
pro
and
con
,
and
to
say
and
write
all
that
could
be
speak
or
write
concern
it
,
without
blot
a
word
,
to
the
admiration
of
all
who
beheld
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
,
say
Yorick
,
interrupt
my
father
,
to
be
make
to
comprehend
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
,
say
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
the
high
stretch
of
improvement
a
single
word
be
capable
of
,
be
a
high
metaphor
,
 
for
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
idea
be
generally
the
bad
,
and
not
the
well
;
 
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
 
when
the
mind
have
do
that
with
it
 
there
be
an
end
,
 
the
mind
and
the
idea
be
at
rest
,
 
until
a
second
idea
enter
;
 
and
so
on
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
use
of
the
Auxiliaries
be
,
at
once
to
set
the
soul
a
-
going
by
herself
upon
the
material
as
they
be
bring
her
;
and
by
the
versability
of
this
great
engine
,
round
which
they
be
twist
,
to
open
new
tract
of
enquiry
,
and
make
every
idea
engender
million
.
  
<EOS>
You

my

which

as
the

have
fail
,
they
retire
into
the
kitchen
to
prepare
a
fomentation
for
me
;
 
and
whilst
that
be
do
,
my
father
determine
the
point
as
you
will
read
.
    
<EOS>
You
see
'
tis
high
time
,
say
my
father
,
address
himself
equally
to
my
uncle
Toby
and
Yorick
,
to
take
this
young
creature
out
of
these
woman
's
hand
,
and
put
him
into
those
of
a
private
governor
.
 
<EOS>
Marcus
Antoninus
provide
fourteen
governor
all
at
once
to
superintend
his
son
Commodus
's
education
,
 
and
in
six
week
he
cashier
five
of
them
;
 
I
know
very
well
,
continue
my
father
,
that
Commodus
's
mother
be
in
love
with
a
gladiator
at
the
time
of
her
conception
,
which
account
for
a
great
many
of
Commodus
's
cruelty
when
he
become
emperor
;
 
but
still
I
be
of
opinion
,
that
those
five
whom
Antoninus
dismiss
,
do
Commodus
's
temper
,
in
that
short
time
,
more
hurt
than
the
other
nine
be
able
to
rectify
all
their
life
long
.
  
<EOS>
now
as
I
consider
the
person
who
be
to
be
about
my
son
,
as
the
mirror
in
which
he
be
to
view
himself
from
morning
to
night
,
by
which
he
be
to
adjust
his
look
,
his
carriage
,
and
perhaps
the
inmost
sentiment
of
his
heart
;
 
I
would
have
one
,
Yorick
,
if
possible
,
polished
at
all
point
,
fit
for
my
child
to
look
into
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
very
good
sense
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
,
continue
my
father
,
a
certain
mien
and
motion
of
the
body
and
all
its
part
,
both
in
act
and
speaking
,
which
argue
a
man
well
within
;
and
I
be
not
at
all
surprise
that
Gregory
of
Nazianzum
,
upon
observe
the
hasty
and
untoward
gesture
of
Julian
,
should
foretel
he
would
one
day
become
an
apostate
;
 
or
that
St.
Ambrose
should
turn
his
Amanuensis
out
of
door
,
because
of
an
indecent
motion
of
his
head
,
which
go
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
flail
;
 
or
that
Democritus
should
conceive
Protagoras
to
be
a
scholar
,
from
see
him
bind
up
a
faggot
,
and
thrust
,
as
he
do
it
,
the
small
twig
inward
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
thousand
unnoticed
opening
,
continue
my
father
,
which
let
a
penetrate
eye
at
once
into
a
man
's
soul
;
and
I
maintain
it
,
add
he
,
that
a
man
of
sense
do
not
lay
down
his
hat
in
come
into
a
room
,
 
or
take
it
up
in
go
out
of
it
,
but
something
escape
,
which
discover
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
for
these
reason
,
continue
my
father
,
that
the
governor
I
make
choice
of
shall
neither

<EOS>

bite
his

,
or
grind
his

,
or
speak
through
his
nose
,
or
pick
it
,
or
blow
it
with
his
finger
.
    
<EOS>
He
shall
neither
walk
fast
,
 
or
slow
,
or
fold
his
arm
,
 
for
that
be
laziness
;
 
or
hang
them
down
,
 
for
that
be
folly
;
or
hide
them
in

for
that

.
    
<EOS>
He
shall
neither
strike

shall

<EOS>
now
this
be
all
nonsense
again
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
I
will
have
him
,
continue
my

cheerful

facete

at
the

prudent

attentive

vigilant

acute

quick
in

<EOS>
and
why
not
humble

<EOS>
He

my

reply
my

get
up

<EOS>
then

answer
my

raise
himself
off

lay
down
his

I

a

and
another

the

to
it

in

as
the
proposition
be
make

<EOS>
you
will
see
why
when
you
read
Le

story
:
 
fool
that
I
be

<EOS>
nor
can
I
recollect
(
nor
perhaps
you

without
turn
back
to
the
place
,
what
it
be
that
hinder
me
from
let
the
corporal
tell
it
in
his
own
word

I
must

<EOS>
the
Story
of
Le
Fever
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
in
the
summer
of
that
year
in
which
Dendermond
be
take
by
the
ally
,
 
which
be
about
seven
year
before
my
father
come
into
the
country
,
 
and
about
as
many
,
after
the
time
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
have
privately
decamp
from
my
father
's
house
in
town
,
in
order
to
lay
some
of
the
fine
siege
to
some
of
the
fine
fortify
city
in
Europe
 
when
my
uncle
Toby
be
one
evening
get
his
supper
,
with
Trim
sit
behind
him
at
a
small
sideboard
,
 
I
say
,
sit
 
for
in
consideration
of
the
corporal
's
lame
knee
(
which
sometimes
give
him
exquisite
pain
)
 
<EOS>
when
my
uncle
Toby
dine
or
sup
alone
,
he
would
never
suffer
the
corporal
to
stand
;
and
the
poor
fellow
's
veneration
for
his
master
be
such
,
that
,
with
a
proper
artillery
,
my
uncle
Toby
could
have
take
Dendermond
itself
,
with
less
trouble
than
he
be
able
to
gain
this
point
over
him
;
for
many
a
time
when
my
uncle
Toby
suppose
the
corporal
's
leg
be
at
rest
,
he
would
look
back
,
and
detect
him
stand
behind
him
with
the
most
dutiful
respect
:
 
<EOS>
this
breed
more
little
squabble
<EOS>
betwixt
them
,
than
all
other
cause
for
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
together
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
neither
here
nor
there
 
<EOS>
why
do
I
mention
it
?
 
<EOS>
ask
my
pen
,
 
<EOS>
it
govern
me
,
 
<EOS>
I
govern
not
it

<EOS>
He
be
one
evening
sit
thus
at
his
supper
,
when
the
landlord
of
a
little
inn
in
the
village
come
into
the
parlour
,
with
an
empty
phial
in
his
hand
,
to
beg
a
glass
or
two
of
sack
;
'
Tis
for
a
poor
gentleman
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
of
the
army

say
the
landlord

who
have
be
take
ill
at
my
house
four
day
ago

have
never
hold
up
his

since

a

taste
any
thing
,
till
just
now
,
that
he
have
a
fancy
for
a
glass
of
sack
and
a
thin
toast
,
 
I
think
,
say
he
,
take
his
hand
from
his
forehead
,
it
would
comfort
me
.
      
<EOS>
if
I
could
neither
beg
,
borrow
,
or
buy
such
a
thing
 
<EOS>
add
the
landlord
,
 
<EOS>
I
would
almost
steal
it
for
the
poor
gentleman
,
he
be
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
God
he
will
still
mend
,
<EOS>
continue
he
,
 
we
be
all
of
us
concerned
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
art
<EOS>
a
good
-
natured
soul
<EOS>
,
I
will
answer
for
thee
,
cry
my
uncle
Toby
;
and
thou
shalt
drink
the
poor
gentleman
's
health
in
a
glass
of
sack
thyself
,
 
and
take
a
couple
of
bottle
with
my
service
,
and
tell
him
he
be
heartily
welcome
to
them
,
and
to
a
dozen
more
if
they
will
do
him
good
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
be
persuade
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
the
landlord
shut
the
door
,
he
be
a
very
compassionate
fellow
 
Trim
,
 
yet
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
entertain
a
high
opinion
of
his
guest
too
;
there
must
be
something
more
than
common
in
him
,
that
in
so
short
a
time
should
win
so
much
upon
the
affection
of
his
host
;
 
and
of
his
whole
family
,
add
the
corporal
,
for
they
be
all
concerned
for
him
,
.
 
<EOS>
Step
after
him
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
do
Trim
,
 
and
ask
if
he
know
his
name
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
quite
forget
it
truly
,
say
the
landlord
,
come
back
into
the
parlour
with
the
corporal
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
ask
his
son
again
:
 
<EOS>
have
he
a
son
with
him
then
?
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
a
boy
,
reply
the
landlord
,
of
about
eleven
or
twelve
year
of
age
;
 
but
the
poor
creature
have
taste
almost
as
little
as
his
father
;
he
do
nothing
but
mourn
and
lament
for
him
night
and
day
:
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
stir
from
the
bed
-
side
these
two
day
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
thrust
his
plate
from
before
him
,
as
the
landlord
give
him
the
account
;
and
Trim
,
without
be
order
,
take
away
,
without
say
one
word
,
and
in
a
few
minute
after
bring
him
his
pipe
and
tobacco
.
    
<EOS>
stay
in
the
room
a
little
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
trim
!
 
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
he
light
his
pipe
,
and
smoak'd
about
a
dozen
whiff
.
 
<EOS>
trim
come
in
front
of
his
master
,
and
make
his
bow
;
 
my
uncle
Toby
smoak'd
on
,
and
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Corporal
!
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
make
his
bow
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
proceed
no
farther
,
but
finish
his
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
trim
!
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
have
a
project
in
my
head
,
as
it
be
a
bad
night
,
of
wrap
myself
up
warm
in
my
roquelaure
,
and
pay
a
visit
to
this
poor
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
's
roquelaure
,
reply
the
corporal
,
have
not
once
be
have
on
,
since
the
night
before
your
honour
receive
your
wound
,
when
we
mount
guard
in
the
trench
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicholas
;
 
and
besides
,
it
be
so
cold
and
rainy
a
night
,
that
what
with
the
roquelaure
,
and
what
with
the
weather
,
'
twill
be
enough
to
give
your
honour
your
death
,
and
bring
on
your
honour
's
torment
in
your
groin
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
so
,
reply
my
uncle
Toby
;
but
I
be
not
at
rest
in
my
mind
,
Trim
,
since
the
account
the
landlord
have
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
not
know
so
much
of
this
affair
,
 
<EOS>
add
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
or
that
I
have
know
more
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
how
shall
we
manage
it
?
 
<EOS>
leave
it
,
<EOS>
an't
please
your
honour
,
to
me
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
;
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
my
hat
and
stick
and
go
to
the
house
and
reconnoitre
,
and
act
accordingly
;
and
I
will
bring
your
honour
a
full
account
in
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
go
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
here
be
a
shilling
for
thee
to
drink
with
his
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
get
it
all
out
of
him
,
say
the
corporal
,
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
fill
his
second
pipe
;
and
have
it
not
be
,
that
he
now
and
then
wander
from
the
point
,
with
consider
whether
it
be
not
full
as
well
to
have
the
curtain
of
the
tennaile
a
straight
line
,
as
a
crooked
one
,
 
he
may
be
say
to
have
think
of
nothing
else
but
poor
Le
Fever
and
his
boy
the
whole
time
he
smoake
it
.
    
<EOS>
the
Story
of
Le
Fever
Continued

<EOS>
It
be
not
till
my
uncle
Toby
have
knock
the
ashe
out
of
his
third
pipe
,
that
corporal
Trim
return
from
the
inn
,
and
give
him
the
follow
account
.
  
<EOS>
I
despair
,
at
first
,
say
the
corporal
,
of
be
able
to
bring
back
your
honour
any
kind
of
intelligence
concern
the
poor
sick
lieutenant
 
<EOS>
be

,
then
?
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
say
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
and
in
what
regiment
?
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
your
honour
,
reply
the
corporal
,
<EOS>
every
thing
straight
forwards
,
as
I
learn
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
Trim
,
I
will
fill
another
pipe
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
not
interrupt
thee
till
thou
hast
do
;
so
sit
down
at
thy
ease
,
Trim
,
in
the
window
-
seat
,
and
begin
thy
story
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
make
his
old
bow
,
which
generally
speak
as
plain
as
a
bow
could
speak
it
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
be
good
:
 
and
have
do
that
,
he
sit
down
,
as
he
be
order
,
 
and
begin
the
story
to
my
uncle
Toby
over
again
in
pretty
near
the
same
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
despair
at
first
,
say
the
corporal
,
of
be
able
to
bring
back
any
intelligence
to
your
honour
,
about
the
lieutenant
and
his
son
;
for
when
I
ask
where
his
servant
be
,
from
whom
I
make
myself
sure
of
know
every
thing
which
be
proper
to
be
ask
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
right
distinction
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
be
answer
,
an
'
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
that
he
have
no
servant
with
him
;
 
that
he
have
come
to
the
inn
with
hire
horse
,
which
,
upon
find
himself
unable
to
proceed
(
to
join
,
I
suppose
,
the
regiment
)
,
he
have
dismiss
the
morning
after
he
come
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
get
well
,
my
dear
,
say
he
,
as
he
give
his
purse
to
his
son
to
pay
the
man
,
 
we
can
hire
horse
from
hence
.
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
the
poor
gentleman
will
never
get
from
hence
,
say
the
landlady
to
me
,
 
for
I
hear
the
death
-
watch
all
night
long
;
 
and
when
he
die
,
the
youth
,
his
son
,
will
certainly
die
with
him
;
for
he
be
broken-
hearted
already
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
hear
this
account
,
continue
the
corporal
,
when
the
youth
come
into
the
kitchen
,
to
order
the
thin
toast
the
landlord
speak
of
;
 
but
I
will
do
it
for
my
father
myself
,
say
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
my
save
you
the
trouble
,
young
gentleman
,
say
I
,
take
up
a
fork
for
the
purpose
,
and
offer
him
my
chair
to
sit
down
upon
by
the
fire
,
whilst
I
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Sir
,
say
he
,
very
modestly
,
I
can
please
him
best
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
his
honour
will
not
like
the
toast
the
bad
for
be
toast
by
an
old
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
the
youth
take
hold
of
my
hand
,
and
instantly
burst
into
tear
.
 
<EOS>
poor
youth
!
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
he
have
be
breed
up
from
an
infant
in
the
army
,
and
the
name
of
a
soldier
,
Trim
,
sound
in
his
ear
like
the
name
of
a
friend
;
 
I
wish
I
have
him
here
.
    
<EOS>
I
never
,
in
the
long
march
,
say
the
corporal
,
have
so
great
a
mind
to
my
dinner
,
as
I
have
to
cry
with
him
for
company
:
 
<EOS>
what
could
be
the
matter
with
me
,
an
'
please
your
honour
?
 
<EOS>
nothing
in
the
world
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
blow
his
nose
,
 
but
that
thou
art
a
good
-
natured
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
give
him
the
toast
,
continue
the
corporal
,
I
think
it
be
proper
to
tell
him
I
be
captain
Shandy
's
servant
,
and
that
your
honour
(
though
a
stranger
)
be
extremely
concerned
for
his
father
;
 
and
that
if
there
be
any
thing
in
your
house
or
cellar
 
(
and
thou
might'st
have
add
my
purse
too
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
)
,
 
<EOS>
he
be
heartily
welcome
to
it
:
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
very
low
bow
(
which
be
mean
to
your
honour
)
,
but
no
answer
 
for
his
heart
be
full
 
<EOS>
so
he
go
up
stair
with
the
toast
;
 
<EOS>
I
warrant
you
,
my
dear
,
say
I
,
as
I
open
the
kitchen
-
door
,
your
father
will
be
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Yorick
's
curate
be
smoke
a
pipe
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
 
but
say
not
a
word
good
or
bad
to
comfort
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
wrong
;
add
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
lieutenant
have
take
his
glass
of
sack
and
toast
,
he
feel
himself
a
little
revived
,
and
send
down
into
the
kitchen
,
to
let
me
know
,
that
in
about
ten
minute
he
should
be
glad
if
I
would
step
up
stair
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
say
the
landlord
,
he
be
go
to
say
his
prayer
,
 
<EOS>
for
there
be
a
book
lay
upon
the
chair
by
his
bed
-
side
,
and
as
I
shut
the
door
,
I
see
his
son
take
up
a
cushion
.
    
<EOS>
I
think
,
say
the
curate
,
that
you
gentleman
of
the
army
,
Mr.
Trim
,
never
say
your
prayer
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
poor
gentleman
say
his
prayer
last
night
,
say
the
landlady
,
very
devoutly
,
and
with
my
own
ear
,
or
I
could
not
have
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
sure
of
it
?
<EOS>
reply
the
curate
.
 
<EOS>
a
soldier
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
say
I
,
pray
as
often
(
of
his
own
accord
)
as
a
parson
;
 
and
when
he
be
fight
for
his
king
,
and
for
his
own
life
,
and
for
his
honour
too
,
he
have
the
most
reason
to
pray
to
God
of
any
one
in
the
whole
world
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
well
say
of
thee
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
a
soldier
,
say
I
,
an

your

have
be
stand
for
twelve
hour
together
in
the
trench
,
up
to
his
knee
in
cold
water
,
 
or
engage
,
say
I
,
for
month
together
in
long
and
dangerous
marche
;
 
harass
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
in
his
rear
to
-
day
;
 
harass
other
to
-
morrow
;
 
detach
here
;
  
<EOS>
countermand
there
;
 
rest
this
night
out
upon
his
arm
;
 
beat
up
in
his
shirt
the
next
;
 
benumb
in
his
joint
;
 
perhaps
without
straw
in
his
tent
to
kneel
on
;
 
must
say
his
prayer
how
and
when
he
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
say
I
,
 
for
I
be
pique
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
for
the
reputation
of
the
army
<EOS>
,
  
I
believe
,
an
'
please
your
reverence

say
I
,
that
when
a
soldier
get
time
to
pray
,
 
he
pray
as
heartily
as
a
parson
,
 
though
not
with
all
his
fuss
and
hypocrisy
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
shouldst
not
have
say
that
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
for
God
only
know
who
be
a
hypocrite

Trim

I

we

Trim

<EOS>
It
be
in
the
scripture
,
say
my

Toby

I

shew
it
thee
to

in

we

for

my

that
God
Almighty

so
good

just
a

of

that
if

it

<EOS>
but
go
on

Trim

say
my

Toby

with
thy

<EOS>
when
I
go
up

continue
the

into
the

which
I
do
not

the

who
press
theirs
on
so
vigorously

that
they
scarce
allow
him
time

<EOS>
that
nevertheless
he
give
up
Dendermond
,
though
he
have
already
make
a
lodgment
upon
the
counterscarp
;
 
and
bend
his
whole
thought
towards
the
private
distress
at
the
inn

except
that
he
order
the
garden
gate
to
be
bolt
up

by
which
he
may
be

to
have
turn
the
siege

into

he
leave
Dendermond
to
itself
 
to
be
relieve
or
not
by
the
french
king
,
as
the
french
king
think
good

only
consider
how

himself
should
relieve
the
poor

his

that
kind

<EOS>
in
the
first
place

when
thou
madest
an

expensive

a
poor

with
a

to

out

there

the
cause
of
it

which
let
you

which
eternally
beckon

from

very
few
word
in

chapter

<EOS>
all
that
be
necessary
to
be
add
to

be
as
follow
.
    
<EOS>
that
my

Toby

with
young
Le
Fever
in
his
hand
,
attend
the
poor
lieutenant
,
as
chief
mourner
,
to
his
grave

<EOS>
that
the
governor
of
Dendermond
pay
his
obsequie
all
military
honour
,
  
and
that
Yorick
,
not
to
be
behind
-
hand
 
pay
him
all
ecclesiastic
 
for
he
bury
him
in
his
chancel
:
 
<EOS>
and
it
appear
likewise
,
he
preach
a
funeral
sermon
over
him
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
appear
,
 
for
it
be
Yorick
's
custom
,
which
I
suppose
a
general
one
with
those
of
his
profession
,
on
the
first
leaf
of
every
sermon
which
he
compose
,
to
chronicle
down
the
time
,
the
place
,
and
the
occasion
of
its
be
preach
:
 
to
this
<EOS>
,
he
be
ever
will
not
to
add
some
short
comment
or
stricture
upon
the
sermon
itself
,
seldom
,
indeed
,
much
to
its
credit
:
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
this
sermon
upon
the
jewish
dispensation
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
it
at
all
;
 
<EOS>
though
I
own
there
be
a
world
of
Water
-
landish
knowledge
in
it
;
 
but
<EOS>
'
tis
all
tritical
,
and
most
tritically
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
but
a
flimsy
kind
of
a
composition
;
what
be
in
my
head
when
I
make
it
?

the

so

so
,
and
no
more

upon
a
couple
Moderato
;
by
which
,
as
far
as
one
may
gather
from
Altieri
's
italian
dictionary
,
 
but
mostly
from
the
authority
of
a
piece
of
green
whipcord
,
which
seem
to
have
be
the
unravelling
of
Yorick
's
whip
-
lash
,
with
which
he
have
leave
us
the
two
sermon
mark
Moderato
,
and
the
half
dozen
of
so

so

tie
fast
together
in

themselves

<EOS>
one
may
safely
suppose
he
mean
pretty
near
the
same
thing
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
difficulty
in
the
way
of
this
conjecture
,
which
be
this
,
that
the
moderato
's
be
five
time
well
than
the
so
,
<EOS>
so
be
;
 
show
ten
time
more
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
;
 
have
seventy
time
more
wit
and
spirit
in
them
;
 
(
and
,
to
rise
properly
in
my
climax
)
 
<EOS>
discover
a
thousand
time
more
genius
;
 
and
to
crown
all
,
be
infinitely
more
entertaining
than
those
tie
up
with
them
:
 
for
which
reason
,
whene'er
Yorick
's
dramatic
sermon
be
offer
to
the
world
,
though
I
shall
admit
<EOS>
but
one
out
of
the
whole
number
of
the
so
,
<EOS>
so
be
,
I
shall
,
nevertheless
,
adventure
to
print
the
two

without
any
sort

scruple

<EOS>
what
Yorick

tenute

sometimes

apply
to

with
which
he
have
characterise
some
of
these

I

capella
upon
a
fourth
;
 
Con
l'arco
upon
this
;
 
Senza
l'arco
upon
that
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
,
that
they
be
musical
term
,
and
have
a
meaning
;
 
and
as
he
be
a
musical
man
,
I
will
make
no
doubt
,
but
that
by
some
quaint
application
of
such
metaphor
to
the
composition
in
hand
,
they
impress
very
distinct
idea
of
their
several
character
upon
his
fancy
,
 
whatever
they
may
do
upon
that
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
amongst
these
,
there
be
that
particular
sermon
which
have
unaccountably
lead
me
into
this
digression
 
<EOS>
the
funeral
sermon
upon
poor
Le
Fever
,
write
out
very
fairly
,
as
if
from
a
hasty
copy
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
notice
of
it
the
more
,
because
it
seem
to
have
be
his
favourite
composition
 
<EOS>
It
be
upon
mortality
;
and
be
tie
length
-
way
and
cros
-
way
with
a
yarn
thrum
,
and
then
roll
up
and
twist
round
with
a
half
-
sheet
of
dirty
blue
paper
,
which
seem
to
have
be
once
the
cast
cover
of
a
general
review
,
which
to
this
day
smell
horribly
of
horse
drug
.
 
<EOS>
whether
these
mark
of
humiliation
be
design
,
 
I
something
doubt
;
 
because
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
(
and
not
at
the
beginning
of
it
)
 
very
different
from
his
way
of
treat
the
rest
,
he
have
write
 
Bravo
!
    
<EOS>
though
not
very
offensively
,
 
for
it
be
at
two
inch
,
at
least
,
and
a
half
's
distance
from
,
and
below
the
conclude
line
of
the
sermon
,
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
page
,
and
in
that
right
hand
corner
of
it
,
which
,
you
know
,
be
generally
cover
with
your
thumb
;
and
,
to
do
it
justice
,
it
be
write
besides
with
a
crow
's
quill
so
faintly
in
a
small
italian
hand
,
as
scarce
to
solicit
the
eye
towards
the
place
,
whether
your
thumb
be
there
or
not
,
 
so
that
from
the
manner
of
it
,
it
stand
half
excused
;
and
be
write
moreover
with
very
pale
ink
,
dilute
almost
to
nothing
,
 
'
tis
more
like
a
ritratto
of
the
shadow
of
vanity
,
than
of
Vanity
herself
 
of
the
two
;
resemble
rather
a
faint
thought
of
transient
applause
,
secretly
stir
up
in
the
heart
of
the
composer
;
than
a
gross
mark
of
it
,
coarsely
obtrude
upon
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
these
extenuation
,
I
be
aware
,
that
in
publish
this
,
I
do
no
service
to
Yorick
's
character
as
a
modest
man
;
 
but
all
man
have
their
failing
!
<EOS>
and
what
lessen
this
still
farther
,
and
almost
wipe
it
away
,
be
this
;
that
the
word
be
strike
through
sometime
afterwards
(
as
appear
from
a
different
tint
of
the
ink
)
with
a
line
quite
across
it
in
this
manner
,
BRAVO
(
cross
out
)
 
as
if
he
have
retract
,
or
be
ashamed
of
the
opinion
he
have
once
entertain
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
these
short
character
of
his
sermon
be
always
write
,
except
in
this
one
instance
,
upon
the
first
leaf
of
his
sermon
,
which
serve
as
a
cover
to
it
;
and
usually
upon
the
inside
of
it
,
which
be
turn
towards
the
text
;
 
but
at
the
end
of
his
discourse
,
where
,
perhaps
,
he
have
five
or
six
page
,
and
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
a
whole
score
to
turn
himself
in
,
 
he
take
a
large
circuit
,
and
,
indeed
,
a
much
more
mettlesome
one
;
 
as
if
he
have
snatch
the
occasion
of
unlace
himself
with
a
few
more
frolicksome
stroke
at
vice
,
than
the
straitness
of
the
pulpit
allow
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
though
hussar
-
like
,
they
skirmish
lightly
and
out
of
all
order
,
be
still
auxiliary
on
the
side
of
virtue
;
 
tell
me
then
,
Mynheer
Vander
Blonederdondergewdenstronke
,
why
they
should
not
be
print
together

<EOS>
when
my

turn
every

into

settle
all

betwixt

there
remain
nothing
more
in
my

I

the
great
injury
could

unmerited
mischance

pursue
him
from

moment

trod
close
upon

for
four
year

somewhat
fanciful
in

require

the

the

all

every

drunk

this

much
to
his
advantage

he
do
every

it

expedient
which
answer
the
purpose
;
 
and
that
be
,
when
any
difficult
and
momentous
point
be
to
be
settle
in
the
family
,
which
require
great
sobriety
,
and
great
spirit
too
,
in
its
determination
,
 
he
fix
and
set
apart
the
first
Sunday
night
in
the
month
,
and
the
Saturday
night
which
immediately
precede
it
,
to
argue
it
over
,
in
bed
with
my
mother
:
 
<EOS>
by
which
contrivance
,
if
you
consider
,
Sir
,
with
yourself
,
.
.
..
  
<EOS>
these
my
father
,
humorously
enough
,
call
his
bed
of
justice
;
 
for
from
the
two
different
counsel
take
in
these
two
different
humour
,
a
middle
one
be
generally
find
out
which
touch
the
point
of
wisdom
as
well
,
as
if
he
have
get
drunk
and
sober
a
hundred
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
not
be
make
a
secret
of
to
the
world
,
that
this
answer
full
as
well
in
literary
discussion
,
as
either
in
military
or
conjugal
;
but
it
be
not
every
author
that
can
try
the
experiment
as
<EOS>
the
Goths
and
Vandals
do
it
  
or
,
if
he
can
,
may
it
be
always
for
his
body
's
health
;
and
to
do
it
,
as
my
father
do
it
<EOS>
,
 
be
I
sure
it
would
be
always
for
his
soul
's
.
  
<EOS>
My
way
be
this
:
    
<EOS>
in
all
nice
and
ticklish
discussion
,
 
(
of
which
,
heaven
know
,
there
be
but
too
many
in
my
book
)
 
<EOS>
where
I
find
I
can
not
take
a
step
without
the
danger
of
have
either
their
worship
or
their
reverence
upon
my
back
 
<EOS>
I
write
one
-
half
full
,
 
and
t'other
fast
;
 
or
write
it
all
full
,
 
and
correct
it
fast
;
 
or
write
it
fast
,
 
and
correct
it
full
,
for
they
all
come
to
the
same
thing
:
 
<EOS>
so
that
with
a
less
variation
from
my
father
's
plan
,
than
my
father
be
from
the
Gothick
 
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
upon
a
par
with
him
in
his
first
bed
of
justice
,
 
and
no
way
inferior
to
him
in
his
second
.
  
<EOS>
these
different
and
almost
irreconcileable
effect
,
flow
uniformly
from
the
wise
and
wonderful
mechanism
of
nature
,
 
of
which
,
 
be
her
be
the
honour
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
we
can
do
,
be
to
turn
and
work
the
machine
to
the
improvement
and
well
manufactory
of
the
art
and
science
.
    
<EOS>
now
,
when
I
write
full
,
 
I
write
as
if
I
be
never
to
write
fast
again
as
long
as
I
live
;
 
that
is
,
I
write
free
from
the
care
as
well
as
the
terror
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
count
not
the
number
of
my
scar
,
 
nor
do
my
fancy
go
forth
into
dark
entry
and
bye
-
corner
to
ante
-
date
my
stab
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
my
pen
take
its
course
;
and
I
write
on
as
much
from
the
fulness
of
my
heart
,
as
my
stomach
.
    
<EOS>
but
when
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
I
indite
fast
,
'
tis
a
different
history
.
 
<EOS>
I
pay
the
world
all
possible
attention
and
respect
,
 
and
have
as
great
a
share
<EOS>
(
whilst
it
last
)
of
that
under
strap
virtue
of
discretion
as
the
good
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
betwixt
both
,
I
write
a
careless
kind
of
a
civil
,
nonsensical
,
good
-
humoured
shandean
book
,
which
will
do
all
your
heart
good
      
<EOS>
and
all
your
head
too
<EOS>
,
 
provide
you
understand
it
.
    
<EOS>
We
should
begin
,
say
my
father
,
turn
himself
half
round
in
bed
,
and
shift
his
pillow
a
little
towards
my
mother
's
,
as
he
open
the
debate
  
<EOS>
We
should
begin
to
think
,
Mrs.
Shandy
,
of
put
this
boy
into
breech
.
    
<EOS>
We
should
so
,
 
say
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
We
defer
it
,
my
dear
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
shamefully
.
    
<EOS>
I
think
we
do
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
 
say
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
the
child
look
extremely
well
,
say
my
father
,
in
his
vest
and
tunick
.
      
<EOS>
He
do
look
very
well
in
them
,
 
reply
my
mother
.
      
<EOS>
and
for
that
reason
it
would
be
almost
a
sin
,
add
my
father
,
to
take
him
out
of
'em
.
      
<EOS>
It
would
so
,
 
say
my
mother
:
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
he
be
grow
a
very
tall
lad
,
 
rejoin
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
very
tall
for
his
age
,
indeed
,
 
say
my
mother
.
      
<EOS>
I
can
not
(
make
two
syllable
of
it
)
<EOS>
imagine
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
who
the
deuce
he
take
after
.
    
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
,
for
my
life
,
say
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
Humph
!
 
<EOS>
say
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
(
the
dialogue
cease
for
a
moment
.
)
    
<EOS>
(
I
be
very
short
myself
,
 
continue
my
father
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
very
short
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
 
say
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Humph
!
<EOS>
quoth
my
father
to
himself
,
a
second
time
<EOS>
:
 
in
muttering
which
,
he
pluck
his
pillow
a
little
further
from
my
mother
's
,
 
and
turn
about
again
,
there
be
an
end
of
the
debate
for
three
minute
and
a
half
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
get
these
breech
make
,
cry
my
father
in
a
high
tone
,
he
will
look
like
a
beast
in
'em
.
  
<EOS>
He
will
be
very
awkward
in
them
at
first
,
reply
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
and
'
twill
be
lucky
,
<EOS>
if
that
be
the
bad
on't
,
add
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
lucky
,
answer
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
reply
my
father
,
 
make
some
pause
first
,
 
he
will
be
exactly
like
other
people
's
child
.
    
<EOS>
exactly
,
say
my
mother
.
      
<EOS>
though
I
shall
be
sorry
for
that
,
add
my
father
:
 
and
<EOS>
so
the
debate
stopp'd
again
.
      
<EOS>
They
should
be
of
leather
,
say
my
father
,
turn
him
about
again
.
    
<EOS>
They
will
last
him
,
say
my
mother
,
the
long
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
can
have
no
lining
to
'em
,
reply
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
He
can
not

say
my

<EOS>
"

I
want
to

inform

<EOS>
Albertus
Rubenius
inform
my

that
the

<EOS>
that

do
not

towards
the
declension
of

when
the
Egyptians
come
to
settle
amongst
them
,
bring
it
into
vogue
.
    
<EOS>
that
person
of
quality
and
fortune
distinguish
themselves
by
the
fineness
and
whiteness
of
their
clothe
;
which
colour
(
next
to
purple
,
which
be
appropriate
to
the
great
office
)
they
most
affected
,
and
wear
on
their
birth
-
day
and
public
rejoicing
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
appear
from
the
good
historian
of
those
time
,
that
they
frequently
send
their
clothe
to
the
full
,
to
be
clean'd
and
whiten
:
 
but
that
the
inferior
people
,
to
avoid
that
expence
,
generally
wear
brown
clothe
,
and
of
a
something
coarser
texture
,
 
till
towards
the
beginning
of
Augustus
's
reign
,
when
the
slave
dress
like
his
master
,
and
almost
every
distinction
of
habiliment
be
lose

the
Latus
Clavus

<EOS>
and
what
be
the
Latus
Clavus
?
<EOS>
say
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Rubenius
tell
him
,
that
the
point
be
still
litigate
amongst
the
learn

that
Egnatius

Bossius

Bayfius
Budaeus

Lipsius

Lazius

Isaac
Casaubon

and
Joseph
Scaliger
,
all
differ
from
each
other
,
 
and
he
from
them
:
 
that
some
take
it
to
be
the
button
,
 
some
the
coat
itself
,
 
other
only
the
colour
of
it

the
fault
be
not

in
his

for
I
be
sure
I
give
him
so
minute
<EOS>
a
description
<EOS>
,
I
be
almost
ashamed
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
Fate
be
look
forwards
one
afternoon
,
into
the
great
transaction
of
future
time
,

recollect
for
what
purpose
this
little
plot
,
by
a

fast
bind
down

have
be
destine

Nature

<EOS>
Nature
throw
half
a

full

her
kindly

upon
it

with
just
so
much
clay
in
it

as
to
retain
the
form
of
angle
and
indenting
,
 
<EOS>
and
so
little
of
it

as
not
to
cling
to
the

render
work

so
much

My

Toby
come
down
,
as
the
reader
have
be
inform
,
with
plan
along
with
him
,
of
almost
every
fortify
town
in
Italy
and
Flanders
;
so
let
the
duke

Marlborough
,
or
the
ally
,
have
set
down
before
what
town
they
please
,
my
uncle
Toby
be
prepare
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
His
way
,
which
be
the
simple
one
in
the
world
,
be
this
;
as
soon
as
ever
a
town
be
invest
 
<EOS>
(
but
sooner
when
the
design
be
know
)
to
take
the
plan
of
it
(
let
it
be
what
town
it
would
)
,
and
enlarge
it
upon
a
scale
to
the
exact
size
of
his
bowling
-
green
;
upon
the
surface
of
which
,
by
mean
of
a
large
role
of
packthread
,
and
a
number
of
small
piquet
drive
into
the
ground
,
at
the
several
angle
and
redan
,
he
transfer
the
line
from
his
paper
;
then
take
the
profile
of
the
place
,
with
its
work
,
to
determine
the
depth
and
slope
of
the
ditch
,
 
the
talus
of
the
glacis
,
and
the
precise
height
of
the
several
banquet
,
parapet
,
&
c.
 
he
set
the
corporal
to
work
 
and
sweetly
go
it
on
:
 
<EOS>
the
nature
of
the
soil
,
 
the
nature
of
the
work
itself
,
 
and
above
all
,
the
good
-
nature
of
my
uncle
Toby
sit
by
from
morning
to
night
,
and
chat
kindly
with
the
corporal
upon
past-
do
deed
<EOS>
,
 
leave
Labour
little
else
but
the
ceremony
of
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
place
be
finish
in
this
manner
,
and
put
into
a
proper
posture
of
defence
,
 
it
be
invest
,
 
and
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
begin
to
run
their
first
parallel
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
interrupt
in
my
story
,
by
be
tell
,
<EOS>
that
the
first
parallel
should
be
at
least
three
hundred
toise
distant
from
the
main
body
of
the
place
,
 
and
that
I
have
not
leave
a
single
inch
for
it
;
 
for
my
uncle
Toby
take
the
liberty
of
incroache
upon
his
kitchen
-
garden
,
for
the
sake
of
enlarge
his
work
on
the
bowling
-
green
,
and
for
that
reason
generally
run
<EOS>
his
first
and
second
parallel
betwixt
two
row
of
his
cabbage
and
his
cauliflower
;
<EOS>
the
convenience
and
inconvenience
of
which
will
be
consider
at
large
in
the
history
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
and
the
corporal
's
campaign
,
of
which
,
this
I
be
now
write
be
but
a
sketch
,
and
will
be
finish
,
if
I
conjecture
right
,
in
three
page
(
but
there
be
no
guess
)
 
<EOS>
the
campaign
themselves
will
take
up
as
many
book
;
and
therefore
I
apprehend
it
would
be
hang
too
great
<EOS>
a
weight
of
one
kind
of
matter
in
so
flimsy
a
performance
as
this
,
to
rhapsodize
them
,
as
I
once
intend
,
into
the
body
of
the
work
 
<EOS>
surely
they
have
better
be
print
apart
,
 
we
will
consider
the
affair
 
so
take
the
follow
sketch
of
them
in
the
mean
time
.
    
<EOS>
when
the
town
,
with
its
work
,
be
finish
,
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
begin
to
run
their
first
parallel
 
not
at
random
,
or
any
how
 
but
from
the
same
point
and
distance
the
ally
have
begin
to
run
theirs
;
and
regulate
their
approach
and
attack
,
by
the
account
my
uncle
Toby
receive
from
the
daily
paper
,
 
they
go
on
,
during
the
whole
siege
,
step
by
step
with
the
ally
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
duke
of
Marlborough
make
a
lodgment
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
make
a
lodgment
too
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
the
face
of
a
bastion
be
batter
down
,
or
a
defence
ruin
,
 
the
corporal
take
his
mattock
and
do
as
much
,
 
and
so
on
;
 
gain
ground
,
and
make
themselves
master
of
the
work
one
after
another
,
till
the
town
fall
into
their
hand
.
  
<EOS>
to
one
who
take
pleasure
in
the
happy
state
of
other
,
 
there
could
not
have
be
a
great
sight
in
world
,
than
on
a
post
morning
,
in
which
a
practicable
breach
have
be
make
by
the
duke
of
Marlborough
,
in
the
main
body
of
the
place
,
 
to
have
stand
behind
the
horn
-
beam
hedge
,
and
observe
the
spirit
with
which
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
Trim
behind
him
,
sally
forth
;
  
the
one
with
the
Gazette
in
his
hand
,
 
the
other
with
a
spade
on
his
shoulder
to
execute
the
content
.
 
<EOS>
what
an
honest
triumph
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
look
as
he
march
up
to
the
rampart
!
 
<EOS>
what
intense
pleasure
swimming
in
his
eye
as
he
stand
over
the
corporal
,
read
the
paragraph
ten
time
over
to
him
,
as
he
be
at
work
,
lest
,
peradventure
,
he
should
make
the
breach
an
inch
too
wide
,
 
or
leave
it
an
inch
too
narrow
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
chamade
be
beat
,
and
the
corporal
help
my
uncle
up
it
,
and
follow
with
the
colour
in
his
hand
,
to
fix
them
upon
the
rampart
  
Heaven

but
what
avail
apostrophes
?
 
<EOS>
with
all
your
element

wet

dry

ye
never
compound
so
intoxicate
a

<EOS>
in
this
track
of
happiness
for
many
year
,
without
one
interruption
to
it
,
except
now
and
then
when
the
wind
continue
to
blow
due
west
for
a
week
or
ten
day
together
,
which
detain
the
Flanders
mail

keep
them
so
long
in
torture
,
 
but
still
'
twa
the
torture
of
the
happy
 
<EOS>
in
this
track
,
I
say
,
do
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
move
for
many
year
,
every
year
of
which
,
and
sometimes
every
month
,
from
the
invention
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
,
add
some
new
conceit
or
quirk
of
improvement
to
their
operation
,
which
always
open
fresh
spring
of
delight
in
carry
them
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
year
's
campaign
be
carry
on
from
beginning
to
end
,
in
the
plain
and
simple
method
I
have
relate
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
second
year
,
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
take
Liege
and
Ruremond
,
he
think
he
may
afford
the
expence
of
four
handsome
draw
-
bridge
;
of
two
of
which
I
have
give
an
exact
description
in
the
former
part
of
my
work
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
latter
end
of
the
same
year
he
add
a
couple
of
gate
with
port-
cullis
:
 
<EOS>
these
last
be
convert
afterwards
into
orgue
,
as
the
well
thing
;
and
during
the
winter
of
the
same
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
instead
of
a
new
suit
of
clothe
,
which
he
always
have
at
Christmas
,
treat
himself
with
a
handsome
sentry
-
box
,
to
stand
at
the
corner
of
the
bowling
-
green
,
betwixt
which
point
and
the
foot
of
the
glacis
<EOS>
,
there
be
leave
a
little
kind
of
an
esplanade
for
him
and
the
corporal
to
confer
and
hold
council
of
war
upon
.
    
<EOS>
the
sentry
-
box
be
in
case
of
rain
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
be
paint
white
three
time
over
the
ensue
spring
,
which
enable
my
uncle
Toby
to
take
the
field
with
great
splendour
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
would
often
say
to
Yorick
,
that
if
any
mortal
in
the
whole
universe
have
do
such
a
thing
except
his
brother
Toby
,
it
would
have
be
look
upon
by
the
world
as
one
of
the
most
refined
satire
upon
the
parade
and
prance
manner
in
which
Lewis
XIV
.
<EOS>
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
,
but
particularly
that
very
year
,
have
take
the
field
 
<EOS>
but
'
tis
not
my
brother
Toby
's
nature
,
kind
soul
!
<EOS>
my
father
would
add
,
to
insult
any
one
.
    
<EOS>
but
let
us
go
on
.
    
<EOS>
I
must
observe
,
that
although
in
the
first
year
's
campaign
,
the
word
town
be
often
mention
,
 
yet
there
be
no
town
at
that
time
within
the
polygon
;
that
addition
be
not
make
till
the
summer
follow
the
spring
in
which
the
bridge
and
sentry
-
box
be
paint
,
which
be
the
third
year
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaign
,
 
when
upon
his
take
Amberg
,
Bonn
,
and
Rhinberg
,
and
Huy
and
Limbourg
,
one
after
another
,
a
thought
come
into
the
corporal
's
head
,
that
to
talk
of
take
so
many
town
,
without
one
Town
to
shew
for
it
,
 
be
a
very
nonsensical
way
of
go
to
work
,
and
so
propose
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
they
should
have
a
little
model
of
a
town
build
for
them
,
 
to
be
run
up
together
of
slit
deal
,
and
then
paint
,
and
clap
within
the
interior
polygon
to
serve
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
feel
the
good
of
the
project
instantly
,
and
instantly
agree
to
it
,
but
with
the
addition
of
two
singular
improvement
,
of
which
he
be
almost
as
proud
as
if
he
have
be
the
original
inventor
of
the
project
itself
.
  
<EOS>
the
one
be
,
to
have
the
town
build
exactly
in
the
style
of
those
of
which
it
be
most
likely
to
be
the
representative
:
 
with
grate
window
,
and
the
gable
end
of
the
house
,
face
the
street
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
as
those
in
Ghent
and
Bruges
,
and
the
rest
of
the
town
in
Brabant
and
Flanders
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
be
,
not
to
have
the
house
run
up
together
,
as
the
corporal
propose
,
but
to
have
every
house
independent
,
to
hook
on
,
or
off
,
so
as
to
form
into
the
plan
of
whatever
town
they
please
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
put
directly
into
hand
,
and
many
and
many
a
look
of
mutual
congratulation
be
exchange
between
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
,
as
the
carpenter
do
the
work
.
    
<EOS>
It
answer
prodigiously
the
next
summer
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
a
perfect
Proteus
 
<EOS>
It
be
Landen
,
and
Trerebach
,
and
Santvliet
,
and
Drusen
,
and
Hagenau
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
Ostend
and
Menin
,
and
Aeth
and
Dendermond
.
    
<EOS>
surely
never
do
any
Town
act
so
many
part
,
since
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
's
town
do
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
fourth
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
think
a
town
look
foolishly
without
a
church
,
add
a
very
fine
one
with
a
steeple
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
be
for
have
bell
in
it
;
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
say
,
the
metal
have
better
be
cast
into
cannon
.
  
<EOS>
this
lead
the
way
the
next
campaign
for
half
a
dozen
brass
field
-
piece
,
to
be
plant
three
and
three
on
each
side
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry
-
box
;
and
in
a
short
time
,
these
lead
the
way
for
a
train
of
somewhat
large
,
 
and
so
on
 
<EOS>
(
as
must
always
be
the
case
in
hobby
-
horsical
affair
)
from
piece
of
half
an
inch
bore
,
till
it
come
at
last
to
my
father
's
jack
boot
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
year
,
which
be
that
in
which
Lisle
be
besiege
,
and
at
the
close
of
which
both
Ghent
and
Bruges
fall
into
our
hand
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
be
sadly
put
to
it
for
proper
ammunition
;
 
I
say
proper
ammunition
 
because
his
great
artillery
would
not
bear
powder
;
and
'
twas
well
for
the
Shandy
family
<EOS>
they
would
not
 
for
so
full
be
the
paper
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
siege
,
of
the
incessant
firing
keep
up
by
the
besieger
,
  
and
so
heated
be
my
uncle
Toby
's
imagination
with
the
account
of
them
,
that
he
have
infallibly
shoot
away
all
his
estate
.
  
<EOS>
something
therefore
be
want
as
a
succedaneum
,
especially
in
one
or
two
of
the
more
violent
paroxysm
of
the
siege
,
to
keep
up
something
like
a
continual
firing
in
the
imagination
,
 
and
this
something
,
the
corporal
,
whose
principal
strength
lie
in
invention
,
supply
by
an
entire
new
system
of
batter
of
his
own
,
 
without
which
,
this
have
be
object
to
by
military
critic
,
to
the
end
of
the
world
,
as
one
of
the
great
desiderata
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
apparatus
.
  
<EOS>
this
will
not
be
explain
the
bad
,
for
set
off
,
as
I
generally
do
,
at
a
little
distance
from
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
with
two
or
three
other
trinket
,
small
in
themselves
,
but
of
great
regard
,
which
poor
Tom
,
the
corporal
's
unfortunate
brother
,
have
send
him
over
,
with
the
account
of
his
marriage
with
the
Jew
's
widow
 
there
be
  
a
Montero
-
cap
and
two
turkish
tobacco
-
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
the
Montero
-
cap
I
shall
describe
by
and
<EOS>
bye
.
 
<EOS>
the
turkish
tobacco
-
pipe
have
nothing
particular
in
them
,
they
be
fit
up
and
ornament
as
usual
,
with
flexible
tube
of
Morocco
leather
and
gold
wire
,
and
mount
at
their
end
,
the
one
of
them
with
ivory
,
 
the
other
with
black
ebony
,
tipp'd
with
silver
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
see
all
thing
in
light
different
from
the
rest
of
the
world
,
would
say
to
the
corporal
,
that
he
ought
to
look
upon
these
two
present
more
as
token
of
his
brother
's
nicety
,
than
his
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
do
not
care
,
trim
,
he
would
say
,
to
put
on
the
cap
,
or
to
smoke
in
the
tobacco
-
pipe
of
a
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
your
honour
,
the
corporal
would
say
(
give
a
strong
reason
to
the
contrary
)
 
<EOS>
how
can
that

except
about
four
inch

which

of
a
portuguese

master
,
not
of

but
of
horse
,
as
the
word
denote
.
  
<EOS>
the
corporal
be
not
a
little
proud
of
it
,
as
well
for
its
own
sake
,
as
the
sake
of
the
giver
,
so
seldom
or
never
put
it
on
<EOS>
but
upon
Gala

day
;
and
yet
never
be
a
Montero

cap
put
to
so
many
use
;
for
in
all
controvert
point
,
whether
military

provide
the

be
sure
he
be
in
the

it
be
either
his
oath

his

his

<EOS>
'
Twas
his
gift
in
the
present
case
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
be
bind
,
say
the
corporal
,
speak
to
himself
,
to
give
away
my
Montero
-
cap
to
the
first
beggar
who
come
to
the
door
,
if
I
do
not
manage
this
matter
to
his
honour
's
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
the
completion
be
no
further
off
,
than
the
very
next
morning
;
which
be
that
of
the
storm
of
the
counterscarp
betwixt
the
Lower
Deule
,
to
the
right
,
and
the
gate
St.
Andrew
,
 
and
on
the
left
,
between
St.
Magdalen
's
and
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
the
most
memorable
attack
in
the
whole
war
,
 
the
most
gallant
and
obstinate
on
both
side
,
 
and
<EOS>
I
must
add
the
most
bloody
too
,
for
it
cost
the
ally
themselves
that
morning
above
eleven
hundred
man
,
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
prepare
himself
for
it
with
a
more
than
ordinary
solemnity
.
  
<EOS>
the
eve
which
precede
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
go
to
bed
<EOS>
,
he
order
his
ramallie
wig
,
which
have
lay
inside
out
for
many
year
in
the
corner
of
an
old
campaigning
trunk
,
which
stand
by
his
bedside
,
to
be
take
out
and
lay
upon
the
lid
of
it
,
ready
for
the
morning
;
 
and
the
very
first
thing
he
do
in
his
shirt
,
when
he
have
step
out
of
bed
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
he
have
turn
the
rough
side
outward
,
 
put
it
on
:
 
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
proceed
next
to
his
breech
,
and
have
button
the
waist
-
band
,
he
forthwith
buckle
on
his
sword
-
belt
,
and
have
get
his
sword
half
way
in
,
 
<EOS>
when
he
consider
he
should
want
shaving
,
and
that
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
do
it
with
his
sword
on
,
 
so
take
it
off
:
 
<EOS>
in
essay
to
put
on
his
regimental
coat
and
waistcoat
,
my
uncle
Toby
find
the
same
objection
in
his
wig
,
 
so
that
go
off
too
:
 
so
that
what
with
one
thing
and
what
with
another
,
as
always
fall
out
when
a
man
be
in
the
most
haste
,
 
'
twas
ten
o'clock
,
which
be
half
an
hour
later
than
his
usual
time
,
before
my
uncle
Toby
sally
out
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
have
scarce
turn
the
corner
of
his
yew
hedge
,
which
separate
his
kitchen
-
garden
from
his
bowling
-
green
,
when
he
perceive
the
corporal
have
begin
the
attack
without
him
.
    
<EOS>
let
me
stop
and
give
you
a
picture
of
the
corporal
's
apparatus
;
and
of
the
corporal
himself
in
the
height
of
his
attack
,
just
as
it
strike
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
he
turn
towards
the
sentry
-
box
,
where
the
corporal
be
at
work
,
 
for
in
nature
there
be
not
such
another
,
 
nor
can
any
combination
of
all
that
be
grotesque
and
whimsical
in
her
work
produce
its
equal
.
  
<EOS>
the
corporal
      
Tread
lightly
on
his
ashe
,
ye
man
of
genius
,
 
<EOS>
for
he
be
your
kinsman
:
  
<EOS>
weed
his
grave
clean
,
ye
man
of
goodness
,
 
for
he
be
your
brother
.
 
<EOS>
oh
corporal
!
<EOS>
have
I
thee
,
but
now
,
 
now
,
that
I
be
able
to
give
thee
a
dinner
and
protection
,
 
how
would
I
cherish
thee
!
<EOS>
thou
should'st
wear
thy
Montero-
cap
every
hour
of
the
day
,
and
every
day
of
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
it
be
wear
out
,
I
would
purchase
thee
a
couple
like
it
:
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
now
that
I
can
do
this
in
spite
of
their
reverence
 
<EOS>
the
occasion
be
lose
 
for
thou
art
go
;
 
thy
genius
flee
up
to
the
star
from
whence
<EOS>
it
come
;
 
and
that
warm
heart
of
thine
,
with
all
its
generous
and
open
vessel
,
compress
into
a
clod
of
the
valley
!
    
<EOS>
but
what
 
what
be
this
,
to
that
future
and
dreaded
page
,
where
I
look
towards
the
velvet
pall
,
decorate
with
the
military
ensign
of
thy
master
 
<EOS>
the
first
 
the
foremost
of
create
being
;
 
<EOS>
where
,
I
shall
see
thee
,
faithful
servant
!
<EOS>
lay
his
sword
and
scabbard
with
a
tremble
hand
across
his
coffin
,
and
then
return
pale
as
ashe
to
the
door
,
to
take
his
mourning
horse
by
the
bridle
,
to
follow
his
hearse
,
as
he
direct
thee
;
 
where
 
all
my
father
's
system
shall
be
baffle
by
his
sorrow
;
and
,
in
spite
of
his
philosophy
,
I
shall
behold
him
,
as
he
inspect
the
lackered
plate
,
twice
take
his
spectacle
from
off
his
nose
,
to
wipe
away
the
dew
which
nature
have
shed
upon
them
 
when
I
see
him
cast
in
the
rosemary
with
an
air
of
disconsolation
,
which
cry
through
my
ear
,
 
o
Toby
!
<EOS>
in
what
corner
of
the
world
shall
I
seek
thy
fellow
?
    
<EOS>
gracious
power
!
<EOS>
which
erst
have
open
the
lip
of
the
dumb
in
his
distress
,
and
make
the
tongue
of
the
stammerer
speak
plain
 
when
I
shall
arrive
at
this
dread
page
,
deal
not
with
me
,
then
,
with
a
stinted
hand
.
    
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
who
the
night
before
have
resolve
in
his
mind
to
supply
the
grand
desideratum
,
of
keep
up
something
like
an
incessant
firing
upon
the
enemy
during
the
heat
of
the
attack
,
 
have
no
further
idea
in
his
fancy
at
that
time
,
than
a
contrivance
of
smoking
tobacco
against
the
town
,
out
of
one
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
six
field
-
piece
,
which
be
plant
on
each
side
of
his
sentry
-
box
;
the
mean
of
effect
which
occur
to
his
fancy
at
the
same
time
,
<EOS>
though
he
have
pledge
his
cap
,
he
think
it
in
no
danger
from
the
miscarriage
of
his
project
.
  
<EOS>
upon
turn
it
this
way
,
and
that
,
a
little
in
his
mind
,
he
soon
begin
to
find
out
,
that
by
mean
of
his
two
turkish
tobacco
-
pipe
,
with
the
supplement
of
three
small
tube
of
wash
-
leather
at
each
of
their
low
end
,
to
be
tagg'd
by
the
same
number
of
tin
-
pipe
fit
to
the
touch-
hole
,
and
seal
with
clay
next
the
cannon
,
and
then
tie
hermetically
with
wax
silk
at
their
several
insertion
into
the
Morocco
tube
,
 
he
should
be
able
to
fire
the
six
field
-
piece
all
together
,
and
with
the
same
ease
as
to
fire
one
.
      
<EOS>
let
no
man
say
from
what
taggs
and
jaggs
hint
may
not
be
cut
out
for
the
advancement
of
human
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
let
no
man
,
who
have
read
my
father
's
first
and
second
bed
of
justice
,
ever
rise
up
and
say
again
,
from
collision
of
what
kind
of
body
<EOS>
light
may
or
may
not
be
strike
out
,
to
carry
the
art
and
science
up
to
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
thou
knowest
how
I
love
them
;
 
thou
knowest
the
secret
of
my
heart
,
and
that
I
would
this
moment
give
my
shirt
 
Thou
art
a
fool
,
Shandy
,
say
Eugenius
,
for
thou
hast
<EOS>
but
a
dozen
in
the
world
,
 
and
<EOS>
'
twill
break
thy
set
.
    
<EOS>
no
matter
for
that
,
Eugenius
;
I
would
give
the
shirt
off
my
back
to
be
burn
into
tinder
,
be
it
only
to
satisfy
one
feverish
enquirer
,
<EOS>
how
many
spark
at
one
good
stroke
,
a
good
flint
and
steel
could
strike
into
the
tail
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
think
ye
not
that
in
strike
these
in
,
 
he
may
,
per-
adventure
,
strike
something
out
?
<EOS>
as
sure
as
a
gun
.
      
<EOS>
but
this
project
,
by
the
bye
.
  
<EOS>
the
corporal
sit
up
the
good
part
of
the
night
,
in
bring
his
to
perfection
;
and
have
make
a
sufficient
proof
of
his
cannon
,
with
charge
them
to
the
top
with
tobacco
,
 
he
go
with
contentment
to
bed
.
    
<EOS>
the
corporal
have
slip
out
about
ten
minute
before
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
order
to
fix
his
apparatus
,
and
just
give
the
enemy
a
shot
or
two
before
my
uncle
Toby
come
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
draw
the
six
field
-
piece
for
this
end
,
all
close
up
together
in
front
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry
-
box
,
leave
only
an
interval
of
about
a
yard
and
a
half
betwixt
<EOS>
the
three
,
on
the
right
and
leave
,
for
the
convenience
of
charging
,
&
c.
 
and
the
sake
possibly
of
two
battery
,
which
he
may
think
double
the
honour
of
one
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
rear
and
face
this
opening
,
with
his
back
to
the
door
of
the
sentry
-
box
,
for
fear
of
be
flank
,
have
the
corporal
wisely
take
his
post
:
 
<EOS>
He
hold
the
ivory
pipe
,
appertain
to
the
battery
on
the
right
,
betwixt
the
finger
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
,
 
and
the
ebony
pipe
tipp'd
with
silver
,
which
appertain
to
the
battery
on
the
left
,
betwixt
the
finger
and
thumb
of
the
other
 
and
with
his
right
knee
fix
firm
upon
the
ground
,
as
if
in
the
front
rank
of
his
platoon
,
be
the
corporal
,
with
his
Montero
-
cap
upon
his
head
,
furiously
play
off
his
two
cross
battery
at
the
same
time
against
the
counter
-
guard
,
which
face
the
counterscarp
,
where
the
attack
be
to
be
make
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
intention
,
as
I
say
,
be
no
more
than
give
the
enemy
a
single
puff
or
two
;
 
but
the
pleasure
of
the
puff
,
as
well
as
the
puffing
,
have
insensibly
get
hold
of
the
corporal
,
and
draw
him
on
from
puff
to
puff
,
into
the
very
height
of
the
attack
,
by
the
time
my
uncle
Toby
join
him
.
  
<EOS>
@@@twa
well
for
my
father
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
have
not
his
will
to
make
that
day
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
take
the
ivory
pipe
out
of
the
corporal
's
hand
,
 
look
at
it
for
half
a
minute
,
and
return
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
less
than
two
minute
,
my
uncle
Toby
take
the
pipe
from
the
corporal
again
,
and
raise
it
half
way
to
his
mouth
 
then
hastily
give
it
back
a
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
corporal
redouble
the
attack
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
smile
,
 
then
look
grave
,
 
then
smile
for
a
moment
,
 
then
look
serious
for
a
long
time
;
  
give
me
hold
of
the
ivory
pipe
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
put
it
to
his
lip
,
 
draw
it
back
directly
,
 
give
a
peep
over
the
horn
-
beam
hedge
;
 
never
do
my
uncle
Toby
's
mouth
water
so
much
for
a
pipe
in
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
retire
into
the
sentry
-
box
with
the
pipe
in
his
hand
.
      
<EOS>
dear
uncle
Toby
!
<EOS>
do
not
go
into
the
sentry
-
box
with
the
pipe
,
 
there
be
no
trust
a
man
's
self
with
such
a
thing
in
such
a
corner
.
    
<EOS>
I
beg
the
reader
will
assist
me
here
,
to
wheel
off
my
uncle
Toby
's
ordnance
behind
the
scene
,
 
to
remove
his
sentry
-
box
,
and
clear
the
theatre
,
if
possible
,
of
horn
-
work
and
half
moon
,
and
get
the
rest
of
his
military
apparatus
out
of
the
way
;
 
that
do
,
my
dear
friend
Garrick
,
we
will
snuff
the
candle
bright
,
 
sweep
the
stage
with
a
new
broom
,
 
draw
up
the
curtain
,
and
exhibit
my
uncle
Toby
dress
in
a
new
character
,
throughout
which
the
world
can
have
no
idea
how
he
will
act
:
 
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
pity
be
a-
<EOS>
kin
to
love
,
 
and
bravery
no
alien
to
it
<EOS>
,
you
have
see
enough
of
my
uncle
Toby
in
these
,
to
trace
these
family
likeness
,
betwixt
the
two
passion
(
in
case
there
be
one
)
to
your
heart
's
content
.
  
<EOS>
Vain
science
!
<EOS>
thou
assist
us
in
no
case
of
this
kind
 
and
thou
puzzlest
us
in
every
one
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
Madam
,
in
my
uncle
Toby
,
a
singleness
of
heart
which
mislead
him
so
far
out
of
the
little
serpentine
track
in
which
thing
of
this
nature
usually
go
on
;
you
can
 
<EOS>
you
can
have
no
conception
of
it
:
 
with
this
<EOS>
,
there
be
a
plainness
and
simplicity
of
thinking
,
with
such
an
unmistrusting
ignorance
of
the
ply
and
folding
of
the
heart
of
woman
;
 
and
so
naked
and
defenceless
<EOS>
do
he
stand
before
you
,
(
when
a
siege
be
out
of
his
head
,
)
that
you
may
have
stand
behind
any
one
of
your
serpentine
walk
,
and
shoot
my
uncle
Toby
ten
time
in
a
day
,
through
his
liver
,
if
nine
time
in
a
day
,
Madam
,
have
not
serve
your
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
this
,
Madam
,
 
and
what
confound
every
thing
as
much
on
the
other
hand
,
my
uncle
Toby
have
that
unparalleled
modesty
of
nature
I
once
tell
you
of
,
and
which
,
by
the
bye
,
stand
eternal
sentry
upon
his
feeling
,
that
you
may
as
soon
 
<EOS>
but
where
be
I
go
?
<EOS>
these
reflection
crowd
in
upon
me
ten
page
at
least
too
soon
,
and
take
up
that
time
,
which
I

Calais

to

he
never

My

Monger

consequently
a
very
dangerous

sit

either
laugh

for
he
generally
know
your

much
well

you

<EOS>
would
always
console
my

upon

in
a
way

plainly

he
imagine
my

grieve
for
nothing
in

so
much

the
loss
of
his
hobby

horse

<EOS>
never

brother

he
would
say
,
 
by
God

blessing
<EOS>
we
shall
have
another

break
out
again
some

day

the

power

I
defy
'em

my

he
would
add

to
take
country
without
take
town

or
town
without

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
never
take
this
back
-
stroke
of
my
father
be
at
his
hobby
-
horse
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
the
stroke
ungenerous
;
and
the
more
so
,
because
in
strike
the
horse
he
hit
the
rider
too
,
and
in
the
most
dishonourable
part
a
blow
could
fall
;
so
that
upon
these
occasion
,
he
always
lay
down
his
pipe
upon
the
table
with
more
fire
to
defend
himself
than
common
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
the
reader
,
this
time
two
year
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
be
not
eloquent
;
and
in
the
very
same
page
give
an
instance
to
the
contrary
:
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
observation
,
and
a
fact
which
contradict
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
eloquent
,
 
it
be
not
easy
to
my
uncle
Toby
to
make
long
harangue
,
 
and
he
hate
florid
one
;
but
there
be
occasion
where
the
stream
overflow
the
man
,
and
run
so
counter
to
its
usual
course
,
that
in
some
part
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
a
time
,
be
at
least
equal
to
Tertullus
 
but
in
other
,
in
my
own
opinion
,
infinitely
above
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
so
highly
pleased
with
one
of
these
apologetical
oration
of
my
uncle
Toby

which
he
have
deliver
one
evening
before

I

may
safely
say
,
I
have
read
over
this
apologetical
oration
of
my

Toby

a
hundred
time
,
and
think
it
so
fine

so

My

an
ill

soever

<EOS>
he
stand
in
an
uneasy
posture
in
vindicate
himself
from
private
view
in

it

<EOS>
for
this
cause
,
if
a
soldier
be
a
prudent
man
,
which
he
may
be
without

the
less
brave
,
he
will
be
sure
not

utter
his

in
the
hearing
of
an
enemy

for
say
<EOS>
what
he
will

an
enemy
will
not
believe
him

<EOS>
He
will
be
cautious
of
do
it
even
to
a
friend
,
 
lest
he
may
suffer
in
his
esteem
:
 
but
if
his
heart
be
overcharged
,
and
a
secret
sigh
for
arm
must
have
its
vent
,
he
will
reserve
it
for
the
ear
of
a

who
know
his

what
his

I

Tis
one

if

more
than
at

there
be
so

equivocal

up

with

many
break

gap

so
little
service
do

nevertheless

I
hang

whenever

you

without

sometimes
dismount
his
horse
,
which
,
as
good
as
say
to
him
,
"
I
will
go
afoot
,
Sir
,
all
the
day
of
my
life
before
I
would
ride
a
single
mile
upon
your
back
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
now
my
uncle
Toby
could
not
be
say
to
dismount
his
horse
in
this
manner
;
for
in
strictness
of
language
,
he
could
not
be
say
to
dismount
his
horse
at
all
 
his
horse
rather
fling
him
 
and
somewhat
viciously
,
which
make
my
uncle
Toby
take
it
ten
time
more
unkindly
.
 
<EOS>
let
this
matter
be
settle
by
state
-
jockie
as
they
like
.
 
<EOS>
It
create
,
I
say
,
a
sort
of
shyness
betwixt
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
and
his
hobby
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
occasion
for
him
from
the
month
of
March
to
November
,
which
be
the
summer
after
the
article
be
sign
,
except
it
be
now
and
then
to
take
a
short
ride
out
,
just
to
see
that
the
fortification
and
harbour
of
Dunkirk
be
demolish
,
accord
to
stipulation
.
  
<EOS>
the
French
be
so
backwards
all
that
summer
in
set
about
that
affair
,
and
Monsieur
Tugghe
,
the
deputy
from
the
magistrate
of
Dunkirk
,
present
so
many
affect
petition
to
the
queen
,
 
beseech
her
majesty
to
cause
only
her
thunderbolt
to
fall
upon
the
martial
work
,
which
may
have
incur
her
displeasure
,
 
but
to
spare
 
to
spare
the
mole
,
for
the
mole
's
sake
;
which
,
in
its
naked
situation
,
could
be
no
more
than
an
object
of
pity
 
and
the
queen
(
who
be
but
a
woman
)
be
of
a
pitiful
disposition
,
  
and
her
minister
<EOS>
also
,
they
not
wish
in
their
heart
to
have
the
town
dismantle
,
for
these
private
reason
,
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.
.
<EOS>
;
so
that
the
whole
go
heavily
on
with
my
uncle
Toby
;
insomuch
,
that
it
be
not
within
three
full
month
,
after
he
and
the
corporal
have
construct
the
town
,
and
put
it
in
a
condition
to
be
destroy
,
that
the
several
commandant
,
commissary
,
deputy
,
negociator
,
and
intendant
,
would
permit
him
to
set
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
fatal
interval
of
inactivity
!
  
<EOS>
the
corporal
be
for
begin
the
demolition
,
by
make
a
breach
in
the
rampart
,
or
main
fortification
of
the
town
 
<EOS>
no
,
 
that
will
never
do
,
corporal
<EOS>
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
in
go
that
way
to
work
with
the
town
,
the
english
garrison
will
not
be
safe
in
it
an
hour
;
because
if
the
French
be
treacherous
 
<EOS>
They
be
as
treacherous
as
devil
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
say
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
It
give
me
concern
always
when
I
hear
it
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
;
 
for
they
do
not
want
personal
bravery
;
and
if
a
breach
be
make
in
the
rampart
,
they
may
enter
it
,
and
make
themselves
master
of
the
place
when
they
please
:
 
<EOS>
let
them
enter
it
,
say
the
corporal
,
lift
up
his
pioneer
's
spade
in
both
his
hand
,
as
if
he
be
go
to
lay
about
him
with
it
<EOS>
,
 
let
them
enter
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
if
they
dare
.
 
<EOS>
in
case
like
this
,
corporal
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
slip
his
right
hand
down
to
the
middle
of
his
cane
,
and
hold
it
afterwards
truncheon
-
wise
with
his
fore
-
finger
extend
,
 
'
tis
no
part
of
the
consideration
of
a
commandant
,
what
the
enemy
dare
,
 
or
what
they
dare
not
do
;
he
must
act
with
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
begin
with
the
outwork
both
towards
the
sea
and
the
land
,
and
particularly
with
fort
Louis
,
the
most
distant
of
them
all
,
and
demolish
it
first
,
 
and
the
rest
,
one
by
one
,
both
on
our
right
and
leave
,
as
we
retreat
towards
the
town
;
 
then
we
will
demolish
the
mole
,
 
<EOS>
next
fill
up
the
harbour
,
 
then
retire
into
the
citadel
,
and
blow
it
up
into
the
air
:
 
and
have
do
that
,
corporal
,
we
will
embark
for
England
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
there
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
recollect
himself
 
very
true
,
say
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
look
at
the
church
.
    
<EOS>
a
delusive
,
delicious
consultation
or
two
of
this
kind
,
betwixt
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
,
upon
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
 
for
a
moment
rally
back
the
idea
of
those
pleasure
,
which
be
slip
from
under
him
:
 
still
  
<EOS>
still
all
go
on
heavily
 
the
magic
leave
the
mind
the
weak
 
stillness
,
with
silence
at
her
back
,
enter
the
solitary
parlour
,
and
draw
their
gauzy
mantle
over
my
uncle
Toby
's
head
;
 
and
Listlessness
,
with
her
lax
fibre
and
undirected
eye
,
sit
quietly
down
beside
him
in
his
arm
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
no
longer
Amberg
and
Rhinberg
,
and
Limbourg
,
and
Huy
,
and
Bonn
,
in
one
year
,
  
and
the
prospect
of
Landen
,
and
Trerebach
,
and
Drusen
,
and
Dendermond
,
the
next
,
 
hurry
on
the
blood
:
 
no
longer
do
sap
,
and
mine
,
and
blind
,
and
gabion
,
and
palisadoe
,
keep
out
this
fair
enemy
of
man
's
repose
:
 
no
more
could
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
pass
the
french
line
,
as
he
eat
his
egg
at
supper
,
from
thence
break
into
the
heart
of
France
,
 
cross
over
the
Oyes
,
and
with
all
Picardie
open
behind
him
,
march
up
to
the
gate
of
Paris
,
and
fall
asleep
with
nothing
but
idea
of
glory
:
 
<EOS>
no
more
be
he
to
dream
,
he
have
fix
the
royal
standard
upon
the
tower
of
the
Bastile
,
and
awake
with
it
stream
in
his
head
.
    
<EOS>
soft
vision
,
 
gentler
vibration
steal
sweetly
in
upon
his
slumber
;
  
<EOS>
the
trumpet
of
war
fall
out
of
his

,
 
he
take
up
the
lute
,
sweet
instrument
!
<EOS>
of
all
other
the
most
delicate
!
<EOS>
the
most
difficult
!
 
<EOS>
how
wilt
thou
touch
it
,
my
dear
uncle
Toby
?
    
<EOS>
now
,
because
I
have
once
or
twice
say
,
in
my
inconsiderate
way
of
talk
,
that
I
be
confident
the
follow
memoir
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
courtship
of
widow
Wadman
,
whenever
I
get
time
to
write
them
,
would
turn
out
one
of
the
most
complete
system
,
both
of
the
elementary
and
practical
part
of
love
and
love
-
making
,
that
ever
be
address
to
the
world
 
<EOS>
be
you
to
imagine
from
thence
,
that
I
shall
set
out
with
a
description
of
what
love
be
?
<EOS>
whether
part
God
and
part
Devil
,
as
Plotinus
will
have
it
      
<EOS>
or
by
a
more
critical
equation
,
and
suppose
the
whole
of
love
to
be
as
ten
 
to
determine
with
Ficinus
,
"
how
many
part
of
it
 
the
one
,
 
and
how
many
the
other
;
"
 
or
whether
it
be
all
of
it
one
great
Devil
,
from
head
to
tail
,
as
Plato
have
take
upon
him
to
pronounce
;
concern
which
conceit
of
his
,
I
shall
not
offer
my
opinion
:
 
but
my
opinion
of
Plato
be
this
;
that
he
appear
,
from
this
instance
,
to
have
be
a
man
of
much
the
same
temper
and
way
of
reason
with
doctor
Baynyard
,
who
be
a
great
enemy
to
blister
,
as
imagine
that
half
a
dozen
of
'em
at
once
,
would
draw
a
man
as
surely
to
his
grave
,
as
a
herse
and
six
 
rashly
conclude
,
that
the
Devil
himself
be
nothing
in
the
world
,
but
one
great
bounce
Cantharidis
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
people
who
allow
themselves
this
monstrous
liberty
in
arguing
,
but
what
Nazianzen
cry
out
(
that
is
,
polemically
)
to
Philagrius
    
"
(
Greek
)
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
rare
!
'
<EOS>
tis
fine
reasoning
,
Sir
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
"
(
Greek
)
"
and
most
nobly
do
you
aim
at
truth
,
when
you
philosophize
about
it
in
your
mood
and
passion
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
it
to
be
imagine
,
for
the
same
reason
,
I
should
stop
to
inquire
,
whether
love
be
a
disease
,
 
or
embroil
myself
with
Rhasis
and
Dioscorides
,
whether
the
seat
of
it
be
in
the
brain
or
liver
;
 
because
this
would
lead
me
on
,
to
an
examination
of
the
two
very
opposite
manner
,
in
which
patient
have
be
treat
 
the
one
,
of
Aoetius
,
who
always
begin
with
a
cool
clyster
of
hempseed
and
bruised
cucumber
;
 
and
follow
on
with
thin
potation
of
water
-
lily
and
purslane
 
to
which
he
add
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
of
the
herb
Hanea
;
 
and
where
Aoetius
durst
venture
it
,
 
his
topaz-
ring
.
    
<EOS>
the
other
,
that
of
Gordonius
,
who
(
in
his
cap
.
<EOS>

.
<EOS>
de
Amore
)
direct
they
should
be
thrash
,
"
ad
putorem
usque
,
"
 
till
they
stink
again
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
disquisition
which
my
father
,
who
have
lay
in
a
great
stock
of
knowledge
of
this
kind
,
will
be
very
busy
with
in
the
progress
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
affair
:
 
<EOS>
I
must
anticipate
thus
much
,
that
from
his
theory
of
love
,
(
with
which
,
by
the
way
,
he
contrive
to
crucify
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
,
almost
as
much
as
his
amours
themselves
,
)
 
<EOS>
he
take
a
single
step
into
practice
;
 
and
by
mean
of
a
camphorate
cerecloth
,
which
he
find
mean
to
impose
upon
the
taylor
for
buckram
,
whilst
he
be
make
my
uncle
Toby
a
new
pair
of
breech
,
he
produce
Gordonius
's
effect
upon
my
uncle
Toby
without
the
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
what
change
this
produce
,
will
be
read
in
its
proper
place
:
 
all
that
be
needful
to
be
add
to
the
anecdote
,
be
this
 
that
whatever
effect
it
have
upon
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
it
have
a
vile
effect
upon
the
house
;
 
and
if
my
uncle
Toby
have
not
smoake
it
down
as
he
do
,
it
may
have
have
a
vile
effect
upon
my
father
too
.
      
<EOS>
'
Twill
come
out
of
itself
by
and
bye
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
contend
for
be
,
that
I
be
not
oblige
to
set
out
with
a
definition
of
what
love
be
;
and
so
long
as
I
can
go
on
with
my
story
intelligibly
,
with
the
help
of
the
word
itself
,
without
any
other
idea
to
it
,
than
what
I
have
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
<EOS>
,
why
should
I
differ
from
it
a
moment
before
the
time
?
 
<EOS>
when
I
can
get
on
no
further
,
 
and
find
myself
entangle
on
all
side
of
this
mystic
labyrinth
,
 
my
opinion
will
then
come
in
,
in
course
,
 
and
lead
me
out
.
  
<EOS>
at
present
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
sufficiently
understand
,
in
tell
the
reader
,
my
uncle
Toby
fall
in
love
:
    
<EOS>
not
that
the
phrase
be
at
all
to
my
liking
:
for
to
say
a
man
be
fall
in
love
,
 
or
that
he
be
deeply
in
love
,
 
or
up
to
the
ear
in
love
,
 
and
sometimes
even
over
head
and
ear
in
it
,
 
carry
an
idiomatical
kind
of
implication
,
that
love
be
a
thing
below
a
man
:
 
<EOS>
this
be
recur
again
to
Plato
's
opinion
,
which
,
with
all
his
divinityship
,
 
I
hold
to
be
damnable
and
heretical
:
 
and
so
much
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
let
love
therefore
be
what
it
will
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
fall
into
it
.
    
<EOS>
and
possibly
,
gentle
reader
,
with
such
a
temptation
 
so
wouldst
thou
:
 
<EOS>
for
never
do
thy
eye
behold

thy
concupiscence
covet
any
thing
in

more
concupiscible
than
widow
Wadman

be
able
to
lie
diagonally
in
his

again
as
long

<EOS>
It
be
a
consume
vexation
to
my
father

that
my
mother
never
ask
the
meaning
of
a
thing
she
do
not
understand

<EOS>
that
she
be
not
a

my

would
say
 
be
her
misfortune

she
may
ask
a
question

<EOS>
My

never

in
short
,
she
go
out
of
the

at
last
without
know
whether

My

have
officiously
tell
her
above
a
thousand
time
which
way
it
be
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
always
forget

a
discourse
seldom
go
on
<EOS>
much
further
betwixt
them
,
than
a
proposition
,
 
a
reply
,
and
a
rejoinder
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
it
generally
take
breath
for
a
few
minute
(
as
in
the
affair
of
the
breech
)
,
and
then
go
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
marry

be
the
bad
for
us

<EOS>
quoth
my
mother

<EOS>
not
a

say
my

he
may
as
well
batter
away
his

as
any
thing
else
,
    
to
be
sure
<EOS>
,
say
my

<EOS>
so
here
end
the
proposition
 
<EOS>
the
reply
,
  
and
the
rejoinder
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
some
amusement
to
him
,
too
,
 
say
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
great
one
,
answer
my

,
if
he
should
have
child

Lord

I
be
now
begin
to
get
fairly
into
my
work
;
and
by
the
help
of
a
vegetable
diet
,
with
a
few
of
the
cold
seed
,
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
able
to
go
on
with
my
uncle
Toby
's
story
,
and
my
own
,
in
a
tolerable
straight
line
.
 
<EOS>
now

squiggly

<EOS>
in
the
fifth
volume
I
have
be
very
good
,
 
the
precise
line
I
have
describe
in
it
be
this
:
  
(

squiggly

where
I
take
a
trip
to
Navarre
,
 
and
the
indent
curve
B.
which
be
the
short
airing
when
I
be
there
with
the
Lady
Baussiere
and
her
page
,
 
I
have
not
take
the
least
frisk
of
a
digression
,
till
John
de
<EOS>
la
Casse
's
devil
lead
me
the
round
you
see
mark
D.
 
for
as
for
c

<EOS>
they
be
nothing
but
parenthesis
,
and
the
common
in
and
out
incident
to
the
life
of
the
great
minister
of
state
;
and
when
compare
with
what
man
have
do
,
 
or
with
my
own
transgression
at
the
letter
<EOS>
ABD
 
<EOS>
they
vanish
into
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
last
volume
I
have
do
better
still
 
for
from
the
end
of
Le
Fever
's
episode
,
to
the
beginning
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaign
,
 
I
have
scarce
step
a
yard
out
of
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
mend
at
this
rate
,
it
be
not
impossible
 
by
the
good
leave
of
his
grace
of
Benevento
's
devil
 
<EOS>
but
I
may
arrive
hereafter
at
the
excellency
of
go
on
even
thus
:
  
(
straight
line
across
the
page
)
  
<EOS>
which
be
a
line
draw
as
straight
as
I
could
draw
it
,
by
a
writing
-
master
's
ruler
(
borrow
for
that
purpose
)
,
turn
neither
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
.
  
<EOS>
this
right
line
,
 
the
path
-
way
for
Christians
to
walk
in
!
<EOS>
say
divine
      
<EOS>
the
emblem
of
moral
rectitude
!
<EOS>
say
Cicero
      
<EOS>
the
good
line
!
<EOS>
say
cabbage
planter
 
be
the
short
line
,
say
Archimedes
,
which
can
be
draw
from
one
give
point
to
another
.
    
<EOS>
I
wish
your
ladyship
would
lay
this
matter
to
heart
,
in
your
next
birth-
day
suit
!
    
<EOS>
what
a
journey
!
  
<EOS>
pray
can
you
tell
me
,
 
that
is
,
without
anger
,
before
I
write
my
chapter
upon
straight
line
 
by
what
mistake
 
who
tell
them
<EOS>
so
 
or
how
it
have
come
to
pass
,
that
your
man
of
wit
and
genius
have
all
along
confound
this
line
,
with
the
line
of
Gravitation
?
    
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
I
say
,
I
would
write
two
volume
every
year
,
provide
the
vile
cough
which
then
torment
me
,
and
which
to
this
hour
I
dread
bad
than
the
devil
,
would
but
give
me
leave
 
and
in
another
place
 
<EOS>
(
but
where
,
I
can
not
recollect
now
)
speak
of
my
book
as
a
machine
,
and
lay
my
pen
and
ruler
down
cross
-
wise
upon
the
table
,
in
order
to
gain
the
great
credit
to
it
 
<EOS>
I
swear
it
should
be
keep
a
going
at
that
rate
these
forty
year
,
if
it
please
but
the
fountain
of
life
to
bless
me
so
long
with
health
and
good
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
now
as
for
my
spirit
,
little
have
I
to
lay
to
their
charge
 
<EOS>
nay
<EOS>
so
very
little
(
unless
the
mount
me
upon
a
long
stick
and
play
the
fool
with
me
nineteen
hour
out
of
the
twenty

four
<EOS>

be
accusation

<EOS>
that
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
much
 
much
to
thank
'em
for
:
 
cheerily
have
ye
make
me
tread
the
path
of
life
with
all
the
burthen
of
it
(
except
its
care
)
upon
my
back
;
in
no
one
moment
of
my
existence
,
that
I
remember
,
have
ye
once
desert
me
,
or
tinge
the
object
which
come
in
my
way
,
either
with
sable
,
or
with
a
sickly
green
;
in
danger
ye
gild
my
horizon
with
hope
,
and
when
death
himself
knock
at
my
door
 
<EOS>
ye
bad
<EOS>
him
come
again
;
and
in
so
gay
<EOS>
a
tone
of
careless
indifference
<EOS>
,
do
ye
do
it
,
that
he
doubt
of
his
commission
    
"
 
<EOS>
there
must
certainly
be
some
mistake
in
this
matter
,
"
quoth
he
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
be
nothing
in
this
world
I
abominate
worse
,
than
to
be
interrupt
in
a
story
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
that
moment
<EOS>
tell
Eugenius
a
most
tawdry
one
in
my
way
,
of
a
nun
who
fancy
herself
a
shell
-
fish
,
and
of
a
monk
damn'd
for
eat
a
muscle
,
and
be
shew
him
the
ground
and
justice
of
the
procedure
    
<EOS>
"
 
do
ever
so
grave
a
personage
get
into
so
vile
a
scrape
?
"
<EOS>
quoth
Death
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
have
a
narrow
escape
,
Tristram
,
say
Eugenius
,
take
hold
of
my
hand
as
I
finish
my
story
    
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
living
,
Eugenius
,
reply
I
,
at
this
rate
;
for
as
this
son
of
a
whore
have
find
out
my
lodging
      
<EOS>
You
call
him
rightly
,
say
Eugenius
,
 
for
by
sin
,
we
be
tell
,
he
enter'd
<EOS>
the
world
 
<EOS>
I
care
not
<EOS>
which
way
<EOS>
he
enter'd
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
provide
he
be
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
take
me
out
with
him
 
for
I
have
forty
volume
to
write
,
and
forty
thousand
thing
to
say
and
do
which
no
body
in
the
world
will
say
and
do
for
me
,
except
thyself
;
and
as
thou
seest
he
have
get
me
by
the
throat
(
for
Eugenius
could
scarce
hear
me
speak
across
the
table
)
,
and
that
I
be
no
match
for
him
in
the
open
field
,
<EOS>
have
I
not
well
,
whilst
these
few
scatter'd
spirit
remain
,
and
these
two
spider
leg
of
mine
(
hold
one
of
them
up
to
him
)
be
able
to
support
me
 
<EOS>
have
I
not
well
,
Eugenius
,
fly
for
my
life
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
my
advice
,
my
dear
Tristram
,
say
<EOS>
Eugenius
 
<EOS>
then
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
will
lead
him
a
dance
he
little
think
of
 
for
I
will
gallop
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
without
look
once
behind
me
,
to
the
bank
of
the
Garonne
;
and
if
I
hear
him
clatter
at
my
heel
 
<EOS>
I
will
scamper
away
to
mount
Vesuvius
 
from
thence
to
Joppa
,
and
from
Joppa
to
the
world
's
end
;
where
,
if
he
follow
me
,
I
pray
God
he
may
break
his
neck
      
<EOS>
He
run
more
risk
there
,
say
Eugenius
,
than
thou
.
  
<EOS>
Eugenius
's
wit
and
affection
bring
blood
into
the
cheek
from
whence
<EOS>
it
have
be
some
month
<EOS>
banish'd
 
<EOS>
'
twas
a
vile
moment
to
bid
adieu
in
;
he
lead
me
to
my
chaise
 
Allons
!
<EOS>
say
I
;
the
post
-
boy
give
a
crack
with
his
whip
  
off
<EOS>
I
go
like
a
cannon
,
and
in
half
a
dozen
bound
get
into
Dover
.
    
<EOS>
now
hang
it
!
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
as
I
look'd
towards
the
french
coast
 
a
man
should
know
something
of
his
own
country
too
,
before
he
go
abroad
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
give
a
peep
into
Rochester
church
,
or
take
notice
of
the
dock
of
Chatham
,
or
visit
St.
Thomas
at
Canterbury
,
though
they
all
three
lay
in
my
way
      
<EOS>
but
mine
,
indeed
,
be
a
particular
case
    
<EOS>
so
without
argue
the
matter
further
with
Thomas
o'Becket
,
or
any
one
else
 
<EOS>
I
skip'd
into
the
boat
,
and
<EOS>
in
five
minute
we
get
under
sail

and
scud
away
like
the
wind

<EOS>
It
be
a
great
inconvenience
to
a
man
in
a
haste
,
that
there
be
three
distinct
road
between
Calais
and
Paris
,
in
behalf
of
which
there
be
so
much
to
be
say
by
the
several
deputy
from
the
town
which
lie
along
them
,
that
half
a
day
be
easily
lose
in
settle
which
you
will
take
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
the
road
by
Lisle
and
Arras
,
which
be
the
most
about
 
but
most
interesting
,
and
instructing
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
,
that
by
Amiens
,
which
you
may
go
,
if
you
would
see
Chantilly
    
and
that
by
Beauvais
,
which
you
may
go
,
if
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
reason
a
great
many
chuse
to
go
by
Beauvais
.
    
<EOS>
"
now
before
I
quit
Calais
,
"
a
travel
-
writer
would
say
,
"
it
would
not
be
amiss
to
give
some
account
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
now
I
think
it
very
much
<EOS>
amiss
 
that
a
man
can
not
go
quietly
through
a
town
and
let
it
alone
,
when
it
do
not
meddle
with
him
,
but
that
he
must
be
turn
about
and
draw
his
pen
at
every
kennel
he
cross
over
,
merely
o
'
my
conscience
for
the
sake
of
draw
it
;
because
,
if
we
may
judge
from
what
have
be
write
of
these
thing
,
by
all
who
have
write
and
gallop'd
 
or
who
have
gallop'd
and
write
,
which
be
a
different
way
still
;
or
who
,
for
more
expedition
than
the
rest
,
have
write
gallop
,
which
be
the
way
I
do
at
present
 
from
the
great
Addison
,
who
do
it
with
his
satchel
of
school
book
hang
at
his
a.
.
.
,
and
gall
his
beast
's
crupper
at
every
stroke
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
gallopper
of
us
all
who
may
not
have
go
on
amble
quietly
in
his
own
ground
(
in
case
he
have
any
)
,
and
have
write
all
he
have
to
write
,
dry
-
shod
,
as
well
as
not
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
as
heaven
be
my
judge
,
and
to
which
I
shall
ever
make
my
last
appeal
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
of
Calais
(
except
the
little
my
barber
tell
me
of
it
as
he
be
whet
his
razor
)
than
I
do
this
moment
of
Grand
Cairo
;
for
it
be
dusky
in
the
evening
when
I
land
,
and
dark
as
pitch
in
the
morning
when
I
set
out
,
and
yet
by
merely
know
what
be
what
,
and
by
draw
this
from
that
in
one
part
of
the
town
,
and
by
spell
and
put
this
and
that
together
in
another
 
I
would
lay
any
travel
odd
,
that
I
this
moment
write
a
chapter
upon
Calais
as
long
as
my
arm
;
and
with
so
distinct
and
satisfactory
a
detail
of

Calais

Calesium

<EOS>
this
town
,
if
we
may
trust
its
archive
,
the
authority
of
which
I
see
no
reason
to
call
in
question
in
this
place
 
be
once
no
more
than
a
small
village
belong
to
one
of
the
first
Counts
de
Guignes
;
and
as
it
boast
at
present
of
no
less
than
fourteen
thousand
inhabitant
,
exclusive
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
distinct
family
in
the
basse
ville
,
or
suburb
 
it
must
have
grow
up
by
little
and
little
,
I
suppose
,
to
its
present
size
.
  
<EOS>
though
there
be
four
convent
,
there
be
but
one
parochial
church
in
the
whole
town
;
I
have
not
an
opportunity
of
take
its
exact
dimension
,
but
it
be
pretty
easy
to
make
a
tolerable
conjecture
of
'em
 
for
as
there
be
fourteen
thousand
inhabitant
in
the
town
,
if
the
church
hold
them
all
it
must
be
considerably
large
 
and
if
it
will
not
 
'
tis
a
very
great
pity
they
have
not
another
 
<EOS>
it
be
build
in
form
of
a
cross
,
and
dedicate
to
the
Virgin
Mary
;
the
steeple
,
which
have
a
spire
to
it
,
be
place
in
the
middle
of
the
church
,
and
stand
upon
four
pillar
elegant
and
light
enough
,
but
sufficiently
strong
at
the
same
time
 
it
be
decorate
with
eleven
altar
,
most
of
which
be
rather
fine
than
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
altar
be
a
master-
piece
in
its
kind
;
'
tis
of
white
marble
,
and
,
as
I
be
tell
,
near
sixty
foot
high
 
<EOS>
have
it
be
much
high
<EOS>
,
it
have
be
as
high
as
mount
Calvary
itself
 
therefore
,
I
suppose
it
must
be
high
enough
in
all
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
strike
me
more
than
the
great
Square
;
tho
'
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
'
tis
either
well
pave
or
well
build
;
but
'
tis
in
the
heart
of
the
town
,
and
most
of
the
street
,
especially
those
in
that
quarter
,
all
terminate
in
it
;
could
there
have
be
a
fountain
in
all
Calais
,
which
it
seem
there
can
not
,
as
such
an
object
would
have
be
a
great
ornament
,
it
be
not
to
be
doubt
,
but
that
the
inhabitant
would
have
have
it
in
the
very
centre
of
this
square
,
 
not
that
it
be
properly
a
square
,
 
because
'
tis
forty
foot
longer
from
east
to
west
,
than
from
north
to
south
;
so
that
the
French
in
general
have
more
reason
on
their
side
in
call
them
Places
than
Squares
,
which
,
strictly
speak
,
to
be
sure
,
they
be
not
.
  
<EOS>
the
town
-
house
seem
to
be
but
a
sorry
building
,
and
not
to
be
keep
in
the
good
repair
;
otherwise
it
have
be
a
second
great
ornament
to
this
place
;
it
answer
however
its
destination
,
and
serve
very
well
for
the
reception
of
the
magistrate
,
who
assemble
in
it
from
time
to
time
;
so
that
'
tis
presumable
,
justice
be
regularly
distribute
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
much
of
it
,
but
there
be
nothing
at
all
curious
in
the
Courgain
;
'
tis
a
distinct
quarter
of
the
town
,
inhabit
solely
by
sailor
and
fisherman
;
it
consist
of
a
number
of
small
street
,
neatly
build
and
mostly
of
brick
;
'
tis
extremely
populous
,
but
as
that
may
be
account
for
,
from
the
principle
of
their
diet
,
 
there
be
nothing
curious
in
that
neither
.
 
<EOS>
a
traveller
may
see
it
to
satisfy
himself
 
<EOS>
he
must
not
omit
however
take
notice
of
La
Tour
de
Guet
,
upon
any
account
;
'
tis
so
call
from
its
particular
destination
,
because
in
war
it
serve
to
discover
and
give
notice
of
the
enemy
which
approach
the
place
,
either
by
sea
or
land
;
 
but
<EOS>
'
tis
monstrous
high
,
and
catch
the
eye
so
continually
,
you
can
not
avoid
take
notice
of
it
if
you
would
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
singular
disappointment
to
me
,
that
I
could
not
have
permission
to
take
an
exact
survey
of
the
fortification
,
which
be
the
strong
in
the
world
,
and
which
,
from
first
to
last
,
that
is
,
for
the
time
they
be
set
about
by
Philip
of
France
,
Count
of
Bologne
,
to
the
present
war
,
wherein
many
reparation
be
make
,
have
cost
(
as
I
learn
afterwards
from
an
engineer
in
Gascony
)
 
above
a
hundred
million
of
livre
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
remarkable
,
that
at
the
Tete
de
Gravelenes
,
and
where
the
town
be
naturally
the
weak
,
they
have
expend
the
most
money
;
so
that
the
outwork
stretch
a
great
way
into
the
campaign
,
and
consequently
occupy
a
large
tract
of
ground
 
<EOS>
however
,
after
all
that
be
say
and
do
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
Calais
be
never
upon
any
account
so
considerable
from
itself
,
as
from
its
situation
,
and
that
easy
entrance
which
it
give
our
ancestor
,
upon
all
occasion
,
into
France
:
it
be
not
without
its
inconvenience
also
;
be
no
less
troublesome
to
the
English
in
those
time
,
than
Dunkirk
have
be
to
us
,
in
ours
;
so
that
it
be
deservedly
look
upon
as
the
key
to
both
kingdom
,
which
no
doubt
be
the
reason
that
there
have
arise
so
many
contention
who
should
keep
it
:
 
of
these
,
the
siege
of
Calais
,
or
rather
the
blockade
(
for
it
be
shut
up
both
by
land
and
sea
)
,
be
the
most
memorable
,
as
it
with
-
stand
the
effort
of
Edward
the
Third
a
whole
year
,
and
be
not
terminate
at
last
but
by
famine
and
extreme
misery
;
the
gallantry
of
Eustace
de
St.
Pierre
,
who
first
offer
himself
a
victim
for
his
fellow
-
citizen
,
have
rank'd
<EOS>
his
name
with
hero
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
will
not
take
up
above
fifty
page
,
it
would
be
injustice
to
the
reader
,
not
to
give
him
a
minute
account
of
that
romantic
transaction
,
as
well
as
of
the
siege
itself
,
in
Rapin
's
own
word
:
      
but
courage
!
<EOS>
gentle
reader
!
 
<EOS>
I
scorn
it
 
<EOS>
'
tis
enough
to
have
thee
in

power
 
but
to
make
use
of
the
advantage
which
the
fortune
of
the
pen
have
now
gain

would
be
too
much
 
<EOS>

powerful

<EOS>
ere
I
would
force
a
helpless
creature
upon
this
hard
service
,
and
make
thee
pay

poor

<EOS>
for
fifty
page
,
which
I
have
no
right
to
sell
thee
,
 
naked

I

I
would
browse
upon

mountain

and
smile
that
the
north

neither

<EOS>
so
put
on

quoth

<EOS>
when
the
precipitancy
of
a

wish
hurry
on
his
idea
ninety
time
faster
than
the

he
ride
in

<EOS>
and
woe
be
to
the
vehicle
and
its

(
<EOS>
let
'em
be
make
of
what

you
will

upon
which
he
breathe
forth
the
disappointment
of
his

!
  
<EOS>
as
I
never
give
general
character
either
of
man
or
thing
in
choler
,
"
the
most
haste
the
bad
speed
,
"
be
all
the
reflection
I
make
upon
the
affair
,
the
first
time
it
happen'd
;
 
the
second
,
third
,
fourth
,
and
fifth
time
,
I
confine
it
respectively
to
those
time
,
and
accordingly
blame
only
the
second
,
third
,
fourth
,
and
fifth
post
-
boy
for
it
,
without
carry
my
reflection
further
;
but
the
event
continue
to
befal
me
from
the
fifth
,
to
the
sixth
,
seventh
,
eighth
,
ninth
,
and
tenth
time
,
and
without
one
exception
,
I
then
could
not
avoid
make
a
national
reflection
of
it
,
which
I
do
in
these
word
;
  
that
something
be
always
wrong
in
a
french
post
-
chaise
,
upon
first
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
or
the
proposition
may
stand
thus
:
  
<EOS>
a
french
postilion
have
always
to
alight
before
he
have
get
three
hundred
yard
out
of
town
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
wrong
now
?
 
<EOS>
Diable
!
 
<EOS>
a
rope
's
broke
!
 
<EOS>
a
knot
have
slipt
!
 
<EOS>
a
staple
's
draw
!
 
<EOS>
a
bolt
's
to
whittle
!
 
<EOS>
a
tag
,
a
rag
,
a
jag
,
a
strap
,
a
buckle
,
or
a
buckle
's
tongue
,
want
altering
.
  
<EOS>
now
true
as
all
this
be
,
I
never
think
myself
impowere
to
excommunicate
thereupon
either
the
post
-
chaise
,
or
its
driver
 
nor
do
I
take
it
into
my
head
to
swear
by
the
live
g
..
<EOS>
,
I
would
rather
go
a
-
foot
<EOS>
ten
thousand
time
 
or
that
I
will
be
damn'd
,
if
ever
I
get
into
another
 
<EOS>
but
I
take
the
matter
coolly
before
me
,
and
consider
,
that
some
tag
,
or
rag
,
or
jag
,
or
bolt
,
or
buckle
,
or
buckle
's
tongue
,
will
ever
be
a
wanting
or
want
altering
,
travel
where
I
will
 
<EOS>
so
I
never
chaff
,
but
take
the
good
and
the
bad
as
they
fall
in
my
road
,
and
get
on
:
 
<EOS>
do
so
,
my
lad
!
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
;
he
have
lose
five
minute
already
,
in
alight
in
order
to
get
at
a
luncheon
of
black
bread
,
which
he
have
cramm'd
into
the
chaise
-
pocket
,
and
be
remount
,
and
go
leisurely
on
,
to
relish
it
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
get
on
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
briskly
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
most
persuasive
tone
imaginable
,
for
I
jingle
a
four
-
and
-
twenty
sous
piece
against
the
glass
,
take
care
to
hold
the
flat
side
towards
him
,
as
he
look'd
back
:
 
the
dog
grinn'd
intelligence
from
his
right
ear
to
his
left
,
and
behind
his
sooty
muzzle
discover
such
a
pearly
row
of
tooth
,
that
Sovereignty
would
have
pawn'd
<EOS>
her
jewel
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
just
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
what
masticator
!
 
<EOS>
/what
bread
!
    
<EOS>
and
so
as
he
finish
the
last
mouthful
of
it
,
we
enter
the
town
of
Montreuil
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
town
in
all
France
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
look
better
in
the
map
,
than
Montreuil
;
 
I
own
,
it
do
not
look
so
well
in
the
book
of
post-
road
;
but
when
you
come
to
see
it
 
to
be
sure
it
look
most
pitifully
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
thing
,
however
,
in
it
at
present
very
handsome
;
and
that
is
,
the
inn
-
keeper
's
daughter
:
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
eighteen
month
at
Amiens
,
and
six
at
Paris
,
in
go
through
her
class
;
so
knit
,
and

thou

take

<EOS>
I
should
certainly
declare
against
submit
to
it
before

therefore
I
never
seriously
think
upon
the
mode
and
manner
of
this
great
catastrophe
,
which
generally
take
up
and
torment
my
thought
as
much
as
the
catastrophe
itself
;

I
constantly
draw
the
curtain
across
it
with
this
wish
,
that
the
Disposer
of
all
thing
may
so
order
it
,
that
it
happen
not
to
me
in
my
own
house
 
but
rather
in
some
decent
inn
 
at
home
<EOS>
,
I
know
it
,
 
<EOS>
the
concern
of
my
friend
,
and
the
last
service
of
wipe
my
brow

smooth
my
pillow

which
the
quiver
hand

pale
affection
shall
pay
me

will
so
crucify
my
soul

that
I
shall
die
of
a
distemper
which
my
physician
be
not
aware
of
:

in
an
inn
,
the
few
cold
office
I
want
,
would
be
purchase
with
a
few
guinea
,
and
pay
me
with
an
undisturbed

punctual
attention
 
but
mark

<EOS>
this
inn
should
not
be
the
inn
at
Abbeville
 
if
there
be
not
another
inn
in
the
universe
,
I
would
strike
that
inn
out
of
the
capitulation
:
so
  
let
the
horse
be
in

which
David

therefore
,

thinketh
the

'

one
of

David
ever
utter'd
against

<EOS>
now
,
I
(
be
very
thin

think
differently

that
so
much
of

be
so
much
of
life

that

blind
as
he
must
be

with
his

draw
differently

with

<EOS>
but
which
of
the
two

in

do
you
think

be
mostly
in

You

under
a
vow
not
to
shave
my
beard
till
I
get
to
Paris
;
 
yet
<EOS>
I
hate
to
make
mystery
of
nothing
;
 
'
tis
the
cold
cautiousness
of
one
of
those
little
soul
from
which
Lessius
(

<EOS>
hath
make
his
estimate
,
wherein
he
setteth
forth
,
that
one
dutch
mile
,
cubically
multiplied
,
will
allow
room
enough
,
and
to
spare
,
for
eight
hundred
thousand
million
,
which
he
suppose
to
be
as
great
a
number
of
soul
(
count
from
the
fall
of
Adam
)
as
can
possibly
be
damn'd
to
the
end
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
from
what
he
have
make
this
second
estimate
 
unless
from
the
parental
goodness
of
God
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
more
at
a
loss
what
could
be
in
Franciscus
Ribbera
's
head
,
who
pretend
that
no
less
a
space
than
one
of
two
hundred
italian
mile
multiply
into
itself
,
will
be
sufficient
to
hold
the
like
number
 
<EOS>
he
certainly
must
have
go
upon
some
of
the
old
roman
soul
,
of
which
he
have
read
,
without
reflect
how
much
,
by
a
gradual
and
most
tabid
decline
,
in
the
course
of
eighteen
hundred
year
,
they
must
unavoidably
have
shrink
so
as
to
have
come
,
when
he
write
,
almost
to
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
in
Lessius
's
time
,
who
seem
the
cool
man
,
they
be
as
little
as
can
be
imagine
      
<EOS>
We
find
them
less
now
    
<EOS>
and
next
winter
we
shall
find
them
less
again
;
so
that
if
we
go
on
from
little
to
less
,
and
from
less
to
nothing
,
I
hesitate
not
one
moment
to
affirm
,
that
in
half
a
century
at
this
rate
,
we
shall
have
no
soul
at
all
;
which
be
the
period
beyond
which
I
doubt
likewise
of
the
existence
of
the
christian
faith

twill
be
one
advantage
that
both
of

the

three

I

<EOS>
you
have
pay
but
for
a
single
post
 
<EOS>
whereas
'
tis
a
post

a
half

and
this
oblige
you
to
pull
out
your
book

post-
road

the
print
of
which
be
so
very
small

it
force
you
to
open
your
eye
,
whether
you
will
or
no
:
 
<EOS>
then
Monsieur
le
Cure
offer
you
a
pinch
of
snuff
 
or
<EOS>
a
poor
soldier
shew
you
<EOS>
his
leg
 
or
a

his
box
 
or
the
priestesse
of
the
cistern
will
water
your
wheel
 
<EOS>
they
do
not
want
it
 
<EOS>
but
she
swear
by
her
priesthood
(
throw
it
back

that
they
do
:
 
<EOS>
then
you
have
all
these
point
to
argue
,
or
consider
over
in
your

in

of

the

so
thoroughly
awakened
 
<EOS>
you
may
get

<EOS>
It
be
entirely
owing
to
one
of
these
misfortune

I
have
pass'd
clean
by
the
stable
of
Chantilly
      
<EOS>

the
postillion
first
affirming

and
then
persist
in
it
to
my

that
there
be
no
mark
upon
the
two

piece
<EOS>
,
I
open'd
<EOS>
my
eye
to
be
convince
  
and
see
the

upon

as
plain
as
my

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
leap'd
out

<EOS>
I
try
it
<EOS>
but
for
three
post

a

believe
'
tis
the

in

for

look
very
inviting
in

<EOS>
you
have
little

nothing

you

by

it

do

in

great
merry

meeting
with
the

,
by
joint
consent
have

come
,
let
us
all
go
live
at
Paris
:
 
<EOS>
the
french
love
good
eating
 
<EOS>
they
be
all
gourmand
 
<EOS>
we
shall
rank
high
;
if
their
god
be
their
belly
 
their
cook
must
be
gentleman
:
 
and
forasmuch
as
the
periwig
maketh
the
man
,
and
the
periwig-
maker
maketh
the
periwig
 
<EOS>
ergo
,
would
the
barber
say
,
we
shall
rank
higher
still
 
<EOS>
we
shall
be
above
you
all
 
<EOS>
we
shall
be
Capitouls
(
Chief
Magistrate

&
c.
&

<EOS>
at
least
 
pardi

<EOS>
we
shall
all
wear
sword
      
<EOS>
and
so
,
one
would
swear
,
(
that
is
,
by
candle

light
,
 
but
<EOS>
there
be
no
depend
upon
it
,
)
<EOS>
they
continue
to
do
,
to
this
day
.
    
<EOS>
the
French
be
certainly
misunderstood
:
 
but
whether
the
fault
be
theirs
,
in
not
sufficiently
explain
themselves
;
or
speak
with
that
exact
limitation
and
precision
which
one
would
expect
on
a
point
of
such
importance
,
and
which
,
moreover
,
be
so
likely
to
be
contest
by
us
 
or
whether
the
fault
may
not
be
altogether
on
our
side
,
in
not
understand
their
language
always
so
critically
as
to
know
"
what
they
would
be
at
"
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
decide
;
but
'
tis
evident
to
me
,
when
they
affirm
,
"
that
they
who
have
see
Paris
,
have
see
every
thing
,
"
they
must
mean
to
speak
of
those
who
have
see
it
by
day
-
light
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
candle
-
light
 
<EOS>
I
give
it
up
 
<EOS>
I
have
say
before
,
there
be
no
depend
upon
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
repeat
it
again
;
but
not
because
the
light
and
shade
be
too
sharp
 
or
the
tint
confound
 
or
that
there
be
neither
beauty
or
keeping
,
&
c
..
.
<EOS>
.for
<EOS>
that
be
not
truth
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
an
uncertain
light
in
this
respect
,
that
in
all
the
five
hundred
grand
Hotels
,
which
they
number
up
to
you
in
Paris
 
and
the
five
hundred
good
thing
,
at
a
modest
computation
(
for
'
tis
<EOS>
only
allow
one
good
thing
to
a
hotel
)
,
which
by
candle

light
be
good
to

feel

hear

<EOS>

idea
be
so
totally
different
as
those
of
Ministers
,
and
innocent
Lovers
:
 
for
which
reason
,
when
I
come
to
talk
of
Statesmen
and
Patriots
,
and
set
such
mark
upon
them
as
will
prevent
confusion
and
mistake
concern
them
for
the
future
 
I
propose
to
dedicate
that
volume
to
some
gentle
Shepherd
,
  
<EOS>
whose
thought
proud
Science
never
teach
to
stray
,
far
as
the
Statesman
's
walk
or
patriot
-
way
;
yet
simple
nature
to
his
hope
have
give
out
of
a
cloud
-
capp'd
head
a
humbler
heaven
;
some
untam'd
world
in
depth
of
wood
embrace
  
<EOS>
some
happy
Island
in
the
wat'ry
-
waste
  
<EOS>
and
where
admit
to
that
equal
sky
,
His
faithful
Dogs
should
bear
him
company
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
by
thus
introduce
an
entire
new
set
of
object
to
his
imagination
,
I
shall
unavoidably
give
a
diversion
to
his
passionate
and
love
-
sick
Contemplations
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
  
I
be
  
the
author
.
  
<EOS>
the
Life
and
Opinions
of
Tristram
Shandy
,
Gent
.
    
<EOS>
now
I
hate
to
hear
a
person
,
especially
if
he
be
a
traveller
,
complain
that
we
do
not
get
on
so
fast
in
France
as
we
do
in
England
;
whereas
we
get
on
much
fast
,
consideratis
considerandis
;
thereby
always
mean
,
that
if
you
weigh
their
vehicle
with
the
mountain
of
baggage
which
you
lie
both
before
and
behind
upon
them
 
and
then
consider
their
puny
horse
,
with
the
very
little
they
give
them
 
'
tis
a
wonder
they
get
on
at
all
:
 
<EOS>
their
suffering
be
most
unchristian
,
and
'
tis
evident
thereupon
to
me
,
that
a
french
post
-
horse
would
not
know
what
in
the
world
to
do
,
be
it
not
for
the
two
word
......
<EOS>
and
......
in
which
there
be
as
much
sustenance
,
as
if
you
give
him
a
peck
of
corn
:
 
now
as
these
word
cost
nothing
,
<EOS>
I
long
from
my
soul
to
tell
the
reader
what
they
be
;
but
here
be
the
question
 
they
must
be
tell
him
plainly
,
and
with
the
most
distinct
articulation
,
or
it
will
answer
no
end
 
and
yet
to
do
it
in
that
plain
way
 
though
their
reverence
may
laugh
at
it
in
the
bed
-
chamber
 
full
<EOS>
well
I
wot
,
they
will
abuse
it
in
the
parlour
:
 
for
which
cause
,
I
have
be
volve
and
revolve
in
my
fancy
some
time
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
by
what
clean
device
or
facette
contrivance
I
may
so
modulate
them
,
that
whilst
I
satisfy
that
ear
which
the
reader
chuse
to
lend
me
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
dissatisfy
the
other
which
he
keep
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
My
ink
burn
my
finger
to
try

and
when
I
have

have
a
bad

It
will
burn
(
I
fear

my

<EOS>
no

the

I

not
say
a
word
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
the
mule
,
each
of
'em
,
a
sound
lash
,
and
look
in
the
abbess
's
and
<EOS>
Margarita
's
face

as
much
as
to

<EOS>
he
give
a
second

"

so
slink
behind

<EOS>
he
enter'd
<EOS>
the
little
inn
at

<EOS>
the
muleteer
,
as
I
tell
you
,
be
a
little
,
joyous
,
chirp
fellow
,
who
think
not
of
to

morrow
,
nor
of
what
have
go
before
,
or
what
be
to
follow
it
,
provide
he
get
<EOS>
but
his
scantling
of
Burgundy
,
and
a
little
chit
-
chat
along
with
it
;
so
enter
into
a
long
conversation
,
as
how
he
be
chief
gardener
to
the
convent
of
Andouillets
,
&
c.
&
c.
and
out
of
friendship
for
the
abbess
and
Mademoiselle
Margarita
,
who
be
only
in
her
noviciate
,
he
have
come
along
with
them
from
the
confine
of
Savoy
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
and
as
how
she
have
get
a
white
swelling
by
her
devotion
 
and
what
a
nation
of
herb
he
have
procure
to
mollify
her
humour
,
&
c.
&
c.
and
that
if
the
water
of
Bourbon
do
not
mend
that
leg
 
<EOS>
she
may
as
well
be
lame
of
both
 
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
 
<EOS>
He
so
contrive
his
story
,
as
absolutely
to
forget
the
heroine
of
it
 
and
with
her
the
little
novice
,
and
what
be
a
more
ticklish
point
to
be
forget
than
both
 
the
two
mule
;
who
be
creature
that
take
advantage
of
the
world
,
inasmuch
as
their
parent
take
it
of
them
 
<EOS>
and
they
not
be
in
a
condition
to
return
the
obligation
downward
(
<EOS>
as
man

be

<EOS>
they
do
it
side

back

up

down

,
and
which
way
they
can

<EOS>
philosopher
,
with
all
their
ethick
,
have
never
consider
this
rightly
 
how
should
the
poor
muleteer
,
then
in
his
cup

consider
it
at
all

<EOS>
he
do
not
in
the

tis
time
we
do

let
us
leave
him
then
in
the
vortex
of
his
element

the
happy

most
thoughtless
of
mortal
man
 
and
for
a
moment
let
us
look
after
the
mule
,
the
abbess

Margarita

<EOS>
by
virtue
of
the
muleteer
's
two
last
stroke
the

have
go
quietly
on
,
follow
their
own
conscience
up
the
hill

till
they
have
conquer'd
<EOS>
about
one
half
of

when
the
elder
of

a
shrewd
crafty
old

at
the
turn

They

answer
Margarita

they

mortal

and
if

we

pronounce
them

They

Heaven

<EOS>
hadst
thou
<EOS>
no

Madam

have
it

upon

melancholy
lecture
of

cross
 
the
peace
of
meekness
,
or
the
contentment
of
resignation
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
incommode
:
 
or
have
I
think
of
write
it
upon
the
purer
abstraction
of
the
soul
,
and
that
food
of
wisdom
and
holiness
and
contemplation
,
upon
which
the
spirit
of
man
(
when
separate
from

be

You

I

as
I
never

get
it
out

we

I
hope
a
little
to
go
on
.
      
<EOS>
all
you
need
say
of
Fontainbleau
(
in
case
you
be
ask'd
)
be
,
that
it
stand
about
forty
mile
(
south
something
)
from
Paris
,
in
the
middle
of
a
large
forest
 
<EOS>
that
there
be
something
great
in
it
 
<EOS>
that
the
king
go
there
once
every
two
or
three
year
,
with
his
whole
court
,
for
the
pleasure
of
the
chace
 
and
that
,
during
that
carnival
of
sporting
,
any
english
gentleman
of
fashion
(
you
need
not
forget
yourself
)
may
be
accommodate
with
a
nag
or
two
,
to
partake
of
the
sport
,
take
care
only
not
to
out-
gallop
<EOS>
the
king
    
<EOS>
though
there
be
two
reason
why
you
need
not
talk
loud
of
this
to
every
one
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
because
'
twill
make
the
say
nag
the
hard
to
be
get
;
and
  
<EOS>
secondly
,
'
tis
not
a

of
it
true

<EOS>

<EOS>
as
for

you
may
dispatch
 
in

word
 
"
'
Tis
an
archiepiscopal
see

"
    
<EOS>
for
Joigny
 
the
less
,
I
think
,
one
say
of
it
the
well
.
  
<EOS>
but
for
Auxerre
 
I
could
go
on
for
ever
:
 
for
in
my
grand
tour
through
Europe
,
in
which
,
after
all
,
my
father
(
not
care
to
trust
me
with
any
one
)
attend
me
himself
,
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
Trim
,
and
Obadiah
,
and
indeed
most
of
the
family
,
except
my
mother
,
who
be
take
up
with
a
project
of
knit
my
father
a
pair
of
large
worsted
breech
 
<EOS>
(
the
thing
be
common
sense
)
 
<EOS>
and
she
not
care
to
be
put
out
of
her
way
<EOS>
,
she
staid
at
home
,
at
Shandy
Hall
,
to
keep
thing
right
during
the
expedition
;
in
which
,
I
say
,
my
father
stop
us
two
day
at
Auxerre
,
and
his
research
be
ever
of
such
a
nature
,
that
they
would
have
find
fruit
even
in
a
desert
  
he
have
leave
me
enough
to
say
upon
Auxerre
:
 
in
short
,
wherever
my
father
go
 
but
'
twas
more
remarkably
so
,
in
this
journey
through
France
and
Italy
,
than
in
any
other
stage
of
his
life
 
his
road
seem
to
lie
so
much
on
one
side
of
that
,
wherein
all
other
traveller
have
go
before
him
 
he
see
king
and
court
and
silk
of
all
colour
,
in
such
strange
light
 
and
his
remark
and
reasoning
upon
the
character
,
the
manner
,
and
custom
of
the
country
we
pass'd
over
,
be
so
opposite
to
those
of
all
other
mortal
man
,
particularly
those
of
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
 
(
to
say
nothing
of
myself
)
 
and
to
crown
all
 
the
occurrence
and
scrape
which
we
be
perpetually
meet
and
get
into
,
in
consequence
of
his
system
and
opiniotry
 
<EOS>
they
be
of
<EOS>
so
odd
,
<EOS>
so
mix'd
and
tragi
-
comical
a
contexture
  
<EOS>
that
the
whole
put
together
,
it
appear
of
so
different
a
shade
and
tint
from
any
tour
of
Europe
,
which
be
ever
execute
 
that
I
will
venture
to
pronounce
 
<EOS>
the
fault
must
be
mine
and
mine
only
 
if
it
be
not
read
by
all
traveller
and
travel
-
reader
,
till
travel
be
no
more
,
 
or
which
come
to
the
same
point
 
till
the
world
,
finally
,
take
it
into
its
head
to
stand
still
.
      
<EOS>
but
this
rich
bale
be
not
to
be
open'd
now
;
except
a
small
thread
or
two
of
it
,
merely
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
my
father
's
stay
at
Auxerre
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
have
mention
it
 
'
tis
too
slight
to
be
keep
suspend
;
and
when
'
tis
wove
in
,
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
go
,
brother
Toby
,
say
my
father
,
whilst
dinner
be
coddle
 
to
the
abbey
of
Saint
Germain
,
if
it
be
only
to
see
these
body
,
of
which
Monsieur
Sequier
have
give
such
a
recommendation
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
see
any
body
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
;
for
he
be
all
compliance
through
every
step
of
the
journey
 
<EOS>
defend
me
!
<EOS>
say
my
father
 
<EOS>
they
be
all
mummy
 
<EOS>
then
one
nee
not
shave
;
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
 
Shave
!
<EOS>
no
 
cry
my
father
 
'
<EOS>
twill
be
more
like
relation
to
go
with
our
beard
on
 
<EOS>
so
out
we
sally
,
the
corporal
lend
his
master
his
arm
,
and
bring
up
the
rear
,
to
the
abbey
of
Saint
Germain
.
  
<EOS>
every
thing
be
very
fine
,
and
very
rich
,
and
very
superb
,
and
very
magnificent
,
say
my
father
,
address
himself
to
the
sacristan
,
who
be
a
young
brother
of
the
order
of
benedictine
 
<EOS>
but
our
curiosity
have
lead
us
to
see
the
body
,
of
which
Monsieur
Sequier
have
give
the
world
so
exact
a
description
.
 
<EOS>
the
sacristan
make
a
bow
,
and
light
a
torch
first
,
which
he
have
always
in
the
vestry
ready
for
the
purpose
;
he
lead
us
into
the
tomb
of
St.
Heribald
 
this
,
say
the
sacristan
,
lay
his
hand
upon
the
tomb
,
be
a
renowned
prince
of
the
house
of
Bavaria
,
who
under
the
successive
reign
of
Charlemagne
,
Louis
le
Debonnair
,
and
Charles
the
Bald
,
bear
a
great
sway
in
the
government
,
and
have
a
principal
hand
in
bring
every
thing
into
order
and
discipline
    
<EOS>
then
he
have
be
as
great
,
say
my
uncle
,
in
the
field
,
as
in
the
cabinet
  
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
have
be
a
gallant
soldier
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
monk
 
<EOS>
say
the
sacristan
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
seek
comfort
in
each
other
's
face
 
but
find
it
not
:
 
my
father
clap
both
his
hand
upon
his
cod
-
piece
,
which
be
a
way
he
have
when
any
thing
hugely
tickle
him
:
 
for
though
he
hate
a
monk
and
the
very
smell
of
a
monk
bad
than
all
the
devil
in
hell
 
yet
the
shot
hit
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
so
much
harder
than
him
,
'
twas
a
relative
triumph
;
and
put
him
into
the
gay
humour
in
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
and
pray
what
do
you
call
this
gentleman
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
rather
sportingly
:
 
this
tomb
,
say
the
young
Benedictine
,
look
downward
,
contain
the
bone
of
Saint
Maxima
,
who
come
from
Ravenna
on
purpose
to
touch
the
body
      
of
Saint
Maximus
,
say
my
father
,
pop
in
with
his
saint
before
him
,
  
<EOS>
they
be
two
of
the
great
saint
in
the
whole
martyrology
,
add
my
father
 
excuse
me
,
say
the
sacristan
 
'
twas
to
touch
the
bone
of
Saint

,
the
builder
of
the
abbey
 
<EOS>
and
what
do
she
get
by
it
?
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
what
do
any
woman
get
by
it
?
<EOS>
say
my
father
 
Martyrdome
;
reply
the
young
Benedictine
,
make
a
bow
down
to
the
ground
,
and
utter
the
word
with
so
humble
,
but
decisive
a
cadence
,
it
disarm
my
father
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
suppose
,
continue
the
Benedictine
,
that
St.
Maxima
have
lain
in
this
tomb
four
hundred
year
,
and
two
hundred
before
her
canonization
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
but
a
slow
rise
,
brother
Toby
,
quoth
my
father

in
this
self

army
of
martyr

<EOS>
a
desperate
slow
one
,
an
'
please
your
honour

say
Trim
,
unless
one
could
purchase
 
<EOS>
I
should
rather
sell
out
entirely

quoth
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
be
pretty
much
of
your
opinion

brother
Toby

my

Poor
St.

<EOS>
say
my

Toby
low
to

from

She

one
of
the
fair
and
most
beautiful
lady
either
of
Italy
or
France
,
continue
the
sacristan
 
<EOS>
but
who
the
duce
have
get
lain
down
here
,
besides
her
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
point
with
his
cane
to
a
large
tomb
as
we
walk
on
 
<EOS>
It
be
Saint
Optat
,
Sir
,
answer
the
sacristan
 
<EOS>
and
properly
be
<EOS>
Saint
Optat
plac'd
!
say
my
father
:
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
Saint
Optat
's
story
?
<EOS>
continue
he
.
 
<EOS>
Saint
Optat
,
reply
the
sacristan
,
be
a
bishop
      
<EOS>
I
think
so
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
cry
my
father
,
interrupt
him
 
Saint
Optat
!
 
<EOS>
how
should
Saint
Optat
fail
?
<EOS>
so
snatch
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
the
young
Benedictine
hold
him
the
torch
as
he
write
,
he
set
it
down
as
a
new
prop
to
his
system
of
christian
name
,
and
I
will
be
bold
to
say
,
so
disintereste
be
he
in
the
search
of
truth
,
that
have
he
find
a
treasure
in
Saint
Optat
's
tomb
,
it
would
not
have
make
him
half
so
rich
:
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
as
successful
a
short
visit
as
ever
be
pay
to
the
dead
;
and
so
highly
be
his
fancy
pleas'd
with
all
that
have
pass
in
it
,
 
that
he
determine
at
once
to
stay
another
day
in
Auxerre
.
    
<EOS>
I
will
see
the
rest
of
these
good
gentry
to
-
morrow
,
say
my
father
,
as
we
cross'd
over
the
square
 
<EOS>
and
while
you
be
pay
that
visit
,
brother
Shandy
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
<EOS>
and
I
will
mount
the
rampart
.
      
<EOS>
now
this
be
the
most
puzzled
skein
of
all
 
for
in
this
last
chapter
,
as
far
at
least
as
it
have
help'd
me
through
Auxerre
,
I
have
be
get
forwards
in
two
different
journie
together
,
and
with
the
same
dash
of
the
pen
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
get
entirely
out
of
Auxerre
in
this
journey
which
I
be
write
now
,
and
I
be
get
half
way
out
of
Auxerre
in
that
<EOS>
which
I
shall
write
hereafter
 
<EOS>
there
be
but
a
certain
degree
of
perfection
in
every
thing
;
and
by
push
at
something
beyond
that
,
I
have
bring
myself
into
such
a
situation
,
as
no
traveller
ever
stand
before
me
;
for
I
be
this
moment
walk
across
the
market
-
place
of
Auxerre
with
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
our
way
back
to
dinner
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
this
moment
also
enter
lyon
with
my
post
-
chaise
<EOS>
break
into
a
thousand
piece
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
moreover
this
moment
in
a
handsome
pavillion
build
by
Pringello
(
the
same
Don
Pringello
,
the
celebrated
spanish
architect
,
of
whom
my
cousin
Antony

make
such
honourable
mention
in

all

<EOS>
let
me
collect
myself
,

pursue
my
journey

<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
it
,
say
I
,
settle
the
account
with
myself
,
as
I
walk'd
<EOS>
into
lyon
 
my
chaise
be
all
lay
higgledy
-
piggledy
with
my
baggage
in
a
cart

which
be
move
slowly
before
me
 
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
glad
,
say
I
,
that
'
tis
all
break
to
piece
;
for
now
I
can
go
directly
by
water
to
Avignon
,
which
will
carry
me
on
a
hundred
and
twenty
mile
of
my
journey
,
and
not
cost
me
seven
livre
 
and
from
thence
,
continue
I
,
bring
forwards
the
account
<EOS>
,
I
can
hire
a
couple
of
mule
 
or
ass
,
if
I
like
,
(
for
nobody
know
me
,
)
and
cross
the
plain
of
Languedoc
for
almost
nothing
 
I
shall
gain
four
hundred
livre
by
the
misfortune
clear
into
my
purse
:
 
and
pleasure
!
<EOS>
worth
 
worth
double
the
money
by
it

<EOS>
with
what
velocity
,
continue
I
,
clap
my
two
hand
together
,
shall
I
fly
down
the
rapid
Rhone
,
with
the
vivare
on
my
right
hand
,
and
Dauphiny
on
my
left
,
scarce
see
the
ancient
city
of
Vienne
,
Valence
,
and
Vivieres
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
flame
will
it
rekindle
in
the
lamp
,
to
snatch
a
blush
grape
from
the
Hermitage
and
Cote
roti
,
as
I
shoot
by
the
foot
of
them
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
fresh
spring
in
the
blood
!
<EOS>
to
behold
upon
the
bank
advance

retire
,
the
castle
of
romance
,
whence
courteous
knight
have
whilome
rescue
the
distress'd
 
and
see
vertiginous

the
rock

the
mountain

the
cataract

and
all
the
hurry
which
nature
be
in
with
all
her
great
work
about
her

<EOS>
as
I
go
on
thus
,
methought
my
chaise

the
wreck
of
which
look'd
<EOS>
stately
enough
at
the
first

insensibly
grow
less

the
freshness

the

be
no

the
gilding
lose
its
lustre
 
and
the
whole
affair
appear
so
poor
in
my
eye
 
<EOS>
so
sorry
!
 
<EOS>
so
contemptible
!
<EOS>
and
,
in
a
word
,
so
much
bad
than
the
abbess
of
Andouillets
'
itself
 
that
I
be
just
open
my
mouth

give
it
to
the

Would

rejoin
the

with

the

to
those
who
call
vexation

vexation

as
know
what
they
be

there
could
not
be
a
great
,
than
to
be
the
good
part
of
a
day
at
Lyons
,
the
most
opulent
and
flourish
city
in
France
,
enrich
with
the
most
fragment
of
antiquity
 
and
not
be
able
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
withhold
upon
any
account
,
must
be
a
vexation
;
but
to
be
withhold
by
a
vexation
 
must
certainly
be
,
what
philosophy
justly
call
 
vexation
 
upon
 
Vexation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
get
my
two
dish
of
milk
coffee
(
which
by
the
bye
be
excellently
good
for
a
consumption
,
but
you
must
boil
the
milk
and
coffee
together
  
otherwise
'
tis
only
coffee
and
milk
)
 
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
no
more
than
eight
in
the
morning
,
and
the
boat
do
not
go
off
till
noon
,
I
have
time
to
see
enough
of
Lyons
to
tire
the
patience
of
all
the
friend
I
have
in
the
world
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
a
walk
to
the
cathedral
,
say
I
,
look
at
my
list
,
and
see
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
this
great
clock
of
Lippius
of
Basil
,
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
    
now
,
of
all
thing
in
the
world
,
I
understand
the
least
of
mechanism
 
I
have
neither
genius
,
or
taste
,
or
fancy
 
and
have
a
brain
so
entirely
unapt
for
every
thing
of
that
kind
,
that
I
solemnly
declare
I
be
never
yet
able
to
comprehend
the
principle
of
motion
of
a
squirrel
cage
,
or
a
common
knife
-
grinder
's
wheel
 
<EOS>
tho
<EOS>
'
I
have
many
an
hour
of
my
life
look'd
<EOS>
up
with
great
devotion
at
the
one
 
and
stand
by
with
as
much
patience
as
any
christian
ever
could
do
,
at
the
other
    
<EOS>
I
will
go
see
the
surprising
movement
of
this
great
clock
,
say
I
,
the
very
first
thing
I
do
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
pay
a
visit
to
the
great
library
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
procure
,
if
possible
,
a
sight
of
the
thirty
volume
of
the
general
history
of
China
,
write
(
not
in
the
Tartarean
,
but
)
in
the
chinese
language
,
and
in
the
chinese
character
too
.
  
<EOS>
now
I
almost
know
as
little
of
the
chinese
language
,
as
I
do
of
the
mechanism
of
Lippius
's
clock
-
work
;
so
,
why
these
should
have
jostle
themselves
into
the
two
first
article
of
my
list
 
<EOS>
I
leave
to
the
curious
as
a
problem
of
Nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
it
look
like
one
of
her
ladyship
's
obliquity
;
and
they
who
court
her
,
be
interested
in
find
out
her
humour
as
much
as
I.
  
<EOS>
when
these
curiosity
be
see
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
half
address
myself
to
my
valet
de
place
,
who
stand
behind
me
 
'
twill
be
no
hurt
if
we
go
to
the
church
of
St.
Irenaeus
,
and
see
the
pillar
to
which
Christ
be
tie
 
and
after
that
,
the
house
where
Pontius
Pilate
live
 
<EOS>
"
Twas
at
the
next
town
,
say
the
valet
de
place
 
at
Vienne
;
I
be
glad
of
it
,
say
I
,
rise
briskly
from
my
chair
,
and
walk
across
the
room
with
stride
twice
as
long
as
my
usual
pace
 
"
for
so
much
the
sooner
<EOS>
shall
I
be
at
the
Tomb
of
the
two
lover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
cause
of
this
movement
,
and
why
I
take
such
long
stride
in
utter
this
 
<EOS>
I
may
leave
to
the
curious
too
;
but
as
no
principle
of
clock
-
work
be
concern
in
it
 
<EOS>
'
twill
be
as
well
for
the
reader
if
I
explain
it
myself
.
    
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
there
be
a
sweet
aera
in
the
life
of
man
,
when
(
the
brain
be
tender
and
fibrillous
,
and
more
like
pap
than
any
thing
else
)
 
a
story
read
of
two
fond
lover
,
separate
from
each
other
by
cruel
parent
,
and
by
still
more
cruel
destiny
    
Amandus

take
captive
by

and
carry
to
the
emperor
of
Morocco
's
court
,
where
the
princess
of
Morocco
fall
in
love
with
him
,
keep
him
twenty
year
in
prison
for
the
love
of
his
Amanda
.
    
<EOS>
She
 
(
Amanda
)
all
the
time
wander
barefoot
,
and
with
dishevell'd
hair
,
o'er
rock
and
mountain
,
enquire
for
Amandus
!
 
<EOS>
Amandus
!
<EOS>
Amandus

make
every

back
his

Amandus

at
every

sit
down
forlorn
at

Amandus

<EOS>
have
my
Amandus
enter'd
?
 
<EOS>
till

go
round
,
and
round
,
and
round
the
world
  
chance
unexpected
bring
them
at
the
same
moment
of
the
night
,
though
by
different
way
,
to
the
gate
of
Lyons
,
their
native
city
,
and
each
in
well-
know
accent
call
out
aloud
,
be
Amandus
/
<EOS>
be
my
Amanda
still
alive
?
<EOS>
they
fly
into
each
other
's
arm
,
and
both
drop
down
dead
for
joy
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
soft
aera
in
every
gentle
mortal
's
life
,
where
such
a
story
afford
more
pabulum
to
the
brain
,
than
all
the
Frusts
,
and
Crusts
,
and
Rusts
of
antiquity
,
which
traveller
can
cook
up
for
it
.
    
<EOS>
'
Twas
all
that
stick
on
the
right
side
of
the
cullender
in
my
own
,
of
what
Spon
and
other
,
in
their
account
of
Lyons
,
have
strain
into
it
;
and
finding
,
moreover
,
in
some
Itinerary
,
but
in
what
God
know
 
<EOS>
that
sacred
to
the
fidelity
of
Amandus
and
Amanda
,
a
tomb
be
build
without
the
gate
,
where
,
to
this
hour
,
lover
call
upon
them
to
attest
their
truth
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
get
into
a
scrape
of
that
kind
in
my
life
,
but
this
tomb
of
the
lover
would
,
somehow
or
other
,
come
in
at
the
close
 
<EOS>
nay
such
a
kind
of
empire
have
it
<EOS>
establish'd
over
me
,
that
I
could
seldom
think
or
speak
of
lyon
 
and
sometimes
not
so
much
as
see
even
a
Lyons
-
waistcoat
,
but
this
remnant
of
antiquity
would
present
itself
to
my
fancy
;
and
I
have
often
say
in
my
wild
way
of
run
on
 
tho
"
<EOS>
I
fear
with
some
irreverence
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
this
shrine
(
neglect
as
it
be
)
as
valuable
as
that
of
Mecca
,
and
so
little
short
,
except
in
wealth
,
of
the
Santa
Casa
itself
,
that
some
time
or
other
,
I
would
go
a
pilgrimage
(
though
I
have
no
other
business
at
Lyons
)
on
purpose
to
pay
it
a
visit
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
my
list
,
therefore
,
of
Videnda
at
Lyons
,
this
,
tho
'
last
,
 
be
not
,
you
see
,
least
;
so
take
a
dozen
or
two
of
long
stride
than
usual
cross
my
room
,
just
whilst
it
pass
my
brain
,
I
walk
down
calmly
into
the
basse
cour
,
in
order
to
sally
forth
;
and
have
call
for
my
bill
 
as
it
be
uncertain
whether
I
should
return
to
my
inn
,
I
have
pay
it
 
<EOS>
have
moreover
give
the
maid
ten
sous
,
and
be
just
receive
the
derni
compliment
of
Monsieur
Le
Blanc
,
for
a
pleasant
voyage
down
the
Rhone
 
when
I
be
stop
at
the
gate
        
'
Twas
by
a
poor
ass
,
who
have
just
turn
in
with
a
couple
of
large
pannier
upon
his
back
,
to
collect
eleemosynary
turnip
-
top
and
cabbage-
leave
;
and
stand
dubious
,
with
his
two
fore
-
foot
on
the
inside
of
the
threshold
,
and
with
his
two
hinder
foot
towards
the
street
,
as
not
know
very
well
whether
he
be
to
go
in
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
'
tis
an
animal
(
be
in
what
hurry
<EOS>
I
may
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
strike
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
patient
endurance
of
suffering
,
write
so
unaffectedly
in
his
look
and
carriage
,
which
plead
so
mightily
for
him
,
that
it
always
disarm
me
;
and
to
that
degree
,
that
I
do
not
like
to
speak
unkindly
to
him
:
 
on
the
contrary
,
meet
him
where
I
will
 
whether
in
town
or
country
 
in
cart
or
under
pannier
 
whether
in
liberty
or
bondage
 
<EOS>
I
have
ever
something
civil
to
say
to
him
on
my
part
;
and
as
one
word
beget
another
(
if
he
have
as
little
to
do
as
I
)
 
I
generally
fall
into
conversation
with
him
;
and
surely
never
be
my
imagination
so
busy
as
in
frame
his
response
from
the
etching
of
his
countenance
 
and
where
those
carry
me
not
deep
enough
 
in
fly
from
my
own
heart
into
his
,
and
see
what
be
natural
for
an
ass
to
think
 
as
well
as
a
man
,
upon
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
in
truth
,
it
be
the
only
creature
of
all
the
class
of
being
below
me
,
with
whom
I
can
do
this
:
 
for
parrot
,
jackdaws
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
I
never
exchange
a
word
with
them
 
nor
with
the
ape
,
&
c.
for
pretty
near
the
same
reason
;
they
act
by
rote
,
as
the
other
speak
by
it
,
and
equally
make
me
silent
:
<EOS>
nay
my
dog
and
my
cat
,
though
I
value
them
both
 
(
and
for
my
dog
he
would
speak
if
he
could
)
 
<EOS>
yet
somehow
or
other
,
they
neither
of
them
possess
the
talent
for
conversation
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
nothing
of
a
discourse
with
them
,
beyond
the
proposition
,
the
reply
,
and
rejoinder
,
which
terminate
my
father
's
and
my
mother
's
conversation
,
in
his
bed
of
justice
 
and
those
<EOS>
utter'd
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
end
of
the
dialogue
      
<EOS>
but
with
an
ass
,
I
can
commune
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
come
,
Honesty
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
 
see
it
be
impracticable
to
pass
betwixt
him
and
the
gate
 
art
thou
for
come
in
,
or
go
out
?
  
<EOS>
the
ass
twist
his
head
round
to
look
up
the
street
    
<EOS>
well
 
reply
I
 
<EOS>
we
will
wait
a
minute
for
thy
driver
:
    
<EOS>
He
turn
his
head
thoughtful
about
,
and
look
wistfully
the
opposite
way
    
I
understand
thee
perfectly
,
answer
I
 
<EOS>
if
thou
takest
a
wrong
step
in
this
affair
,
he
will
cudgel
thee
to
death
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
a
minute
be
but
a
minute
,
and
if
it
save
a
fellow
-
creature
a
drubbing
,
it
shall
not
be
set
down
as
ill
-
spend
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
eat
the
stem
of
an
artichoke
as
this
discourse
go
on
,
and
in
the
little
peevish
contention
of
nature
betwixt
hunger
and
unsavouriness
<EOS>
,
have
dropt
it
out
of
his
mouth
half
a
dozen
time
,
and
<EOS>
pick'd
it
up
again
  
God
help
thee
,
Jack
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
thou
hast
a
bitter
breakfast
<EOS>
on't
 
and
<EOS>
many
a
bitter
day
's
labour
,
 
and
many
a
bitter
blow
,
I
fear
,
for
its
wage
 
'
tis
all
 
all
bitterness
to
thee
,
<EOS>
whatever
life
be
to
other
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
thy
mouth
,
if
one
know
the
truth
of
it
,
be
as
bitter
,
I
dare
say
,
as
soot
 
<EOS>
(
for
he
have
cast
aside
the
stem
)
and
thou
hast
not
a
friend
perhaps
in
all
this
world
,
that
will
give
thee
a
macaroon
.
 
<EOS>
in
say
this
,
I
pull'd
out
a
paper
of
'em
,
which
I
have
just
purchase
,
and
give
him
one
 
and
at
this
moment
that
I
be
tell
it
,
my
heart
smite
me
,
that
there
be
more
of
pleasantry
in
the
conceit
,
of
see
how
an
ass
would
eat
a
macaroon
 
than
of
benevolence
in
give
him
one
,
which
preside
in
the
act
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
ass
have
eat
his
macaroon
,
I
<EOS>
press'd
him
to
come
in
 
<EOS>
the
poor
beast
be
heavy
loaded
 
<EOS>
his
leg
seem'd
to
tremble
under
him
 
he
hang
rather
backwards
,
and
as
I
pull'd
<EOS>
at
his
halter
,
it
break
short
in
my
hand
 
<EOS>
he
look'd
up
pensive
in
my
face
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
thrash
me
with
it
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
will
,
you
may
"
 
if
I
do
,
say
I
<EOS>
,
I
will
be
d
<EOS>
....
d
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
be
but
one
-
half
of
it
pronounce
,
like
the
abbess
of
Andouillet
's
 
<EOS>
(
so
there
be
no
sin
in
it
)
 
<EOS>
when
a
person
come
in
,
let
fall
a
thundering
bastinado
upon
the
poor
devil
's
crupper
,
which
put
an
end
to
the
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
out
upon
it
!
<EOS>
cry
I
 
<EOS>
but
the
interjection
be
equivocal
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
think
,
wrong
place
too
 
for
the
end
of
an
osier
which
have
start
out
from
the
contexture
of
the
ass
's
panier
,
have
catch
hold
of
my
breech
pocket
,
as
he
rush'd
by
me
,
and
rent
it
in
the
most
disastrous
direction
you
can
imagine
 
so
that
the
  
out
upon
it
!
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
should
have
come
in
here
 
<EOS>
but
this
I
leave
to
be
settle
by
the
Reviewers
of
My
Breeches
,
which
I
have
bring
over
along
with
me
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
when
all
be
set
to
right
,
I
come
down
stair
again
into
the
basse
cour
with
my
valet
de
place
,
in
order
to
sally
out
towards
the
tomb
of
the
two
lover
,
&
c.
 
and
be
a
second
time
stopp'd
<EOS>
at
the
gate
 
not
by
the
ass
 
<EOS>
but
by
the
person
who
strike
him
;
and
who
,
by
that
time
,
have
take
possession
(
as
be
not
uncommon
after
a
defeat
)
of
the
very
spot
of
ground
where
the
ass
stand
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
commissary
send
to
me
from
the
post
-
office
,
with
a
rescript
in
his
hand
for
the
payment
of
some
six
livre
odd
sous
.
  
<EOS>
upon
what
account
?
<EOS>
say
I.

myself
to
the
commissary

only
the
form
of
my
asseveration
 
that
I
owe
the
king
of
France
nothing
but
my
good
will

he
be
a
very
honest
man

I
wish
him
all
health
and
pastime
in
the
world

<EOS>
as
I
perceive
the
commissary
of
the
post

office
would
have
his
six
livre
four
sous
,
I
have
nothing
else
for
it
,
but
to
say
some
smart
thing
upon
the
occasion
,
worth
the
money
:
  
<EOS>
and
so
I
set
off
thus
:
      
and
pray
,
Mr.
Commissary
,
by
what
law
of
courtesy
be
a
defenceless
stranger
to
be
use
just
the
reverse
from
what
you
use
a
Frenchman
in
this
matter
?
  
<EOS>
by
no
mean
;
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
excuse
me
;
say
I
 
for
you
have
begin
,
Sir
,
with
first
tearing
off
my
breech
-
<EOS>
and
now
you
want
my
pocket
    
<EOS>
Whereas
 
<EOS>
have
you
first
take
my
pocket
,
as
you
do
with
your
own
people
 
and
then
leave
me
bare
<EOS>
a####'d
<EOS>
after
 
I
have
be
a
beast
to
have
complain'd
    
<EOS>
as
it
be
      
'
Tis
contrary
to
the
law
of
nature
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
contrary
to
reason
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
contrary
to
the
Gospel
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
to
this
 
say
he
 
put
a
print
paper
into
my
hand
,
  
Par
le
Roy
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
pithy
prolegomenon
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
 
and
so
read
on
.
.
..
    
<EOS>
by
all
which
it
appear
,
quoth
I
,
have
read
it
over
,
a
little
too
rapidly
,
that
if
a
man
set
out
in
a
post
-
chaise
from
Paris
 
he
must
go
on
travel
in
one
,
all
the
day
of
his
life
 
or
pay
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
say
the
commissary
,
the
spirit
of
the
ordinance
be
this
 
that
if
you
set
out
with
an
intention
of
run
post
from
Paris
to
Avignon
,
&
c.
you
shall
not
change
that
intention
or
mode
of
travelling
,
without
first
satisfy
the
fermier
for
two
post
further
than
the
place
you
repent
at
 
and
'
tis
found
,
continue
he
,
upon
this
,
that
the
revenue
be
not
to
fall
short
through
your
fickleness
      
o
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
cry
I
 
if
fickleness
be
taxable
in
France
 
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
the
good
peace
with
you
<EOS>
we
can
    
<EOS>
and
so
the
peace
be
make
;
    
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
a
bad
one
 
as
Tristram
Shandy
lay
the
corner
-
stone
of
it
  
nobody
but
Tristram
Shandy
ought
to
be
hang
.
    
<EOS>
though
I
be
sensible
I
have
say
as
many
clever
thing
to
the
commissary
 
<EOS>
as
come
to
six
livre
four

she
take

time
,
say

for

almost
eleven
 
<EOS>
then
we
must
speed

,
say
I
,
stride
it
away
to
the
cathedral

<EOS>
I
can
not

,
in

,
that
it
give

any

tell
by

of
the

as
I
be
enter

that
Lippius
's
great
clock
be
all
out

and
have
not

<EOS>
It
will
give
me
the
more
time
,
think
<EOS>
I
,
to
peruse
the
chinese
history
;
and
besides
I
shall
be
able
to
give
the
world
a
well
account
of
the
clock
in
its
decay
,
than
I
could
have
do
in
its

condition
      
<EOS>
and
so
away
I
post
to
the
college
of
the

.
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
with
the
project
of
get
a
peep
at
the
history
of
China
in
chinese
character
 
as
with
many
other
I
could
mention

which
strike

my

go
off

at

I

gratify
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
my
time
be
short

and
my
heart
be
at
the
Tomb
of
the
Lovers
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
God
,
say
I
,
as
I
get
the
rapper
in
my
hand
,
that
the
key
of
the

may
be
but
lose

it
fall
out

<EOS>
for

to

never

<EOS>
as
I

the
geography
of
the
Tomb

as
well
as
if
I
have
live
twenty
year
in
Lyons

namely
,
that
it
be
upon
the
turning
of
my
right
hand

just
without
the
gate
,
lead
to
the
Fauxbourg
de
Vaise
 
<EOS>
I
dispatch
Francois
to

,
that
I
may
pay
the
homage
<EOS>
I
so
long
ow'd
it
,
without
a
witness
of
my
weakness
 
I
<EOS>
walk'd
<EOS>
with
all
imaginable
joy
towards
the
place
 
when
I
see
the
gate
which
intercept
the
tomb
,
my

glow
within

Tender
and
faithful

!
<EOS>
cry
I
,
address
myself
to
Amandus
and
Amanda
 
long
 
long

I
tarry
to

this

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
when
I

there
be

upon

<EOS>
what
would
I
have
give
for
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
have
whistle
Lillo
bullero
!
    
<EOS>
no
matter
how
,
or
in
what
mood
 
<EOS>
but
I
fly
from
the
tomb
of
the
lover
 
or
rather
<EOS>
I
do
not
fly
from
it
 
(
for
there
be
no
such
thing
exist
)
and
just
get
time
enough
to
the
boat
to
save
my
passage
;
 
and
ere
<EOS>
I
have
sail
a
hundred
yard
,
the
Rhone
and
the
Saon
meet
together
,
and
carry
me
down
merrily
betwixt
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
have
describe
this
voyage
down
the
Rhone
,
before
I
make
it
      
<EOS>
so
now
I
be
at
Avignon
,
and
as
there
be
nothing
to
see
but
the
old
house
,
in
which
the
duke
of
Ormond
reside
,
and
nothing
to
stop
me
but
a
short
remark
upon
the
place
,
in
three
minute
you
will
see
me
cross
the
bridge
upon
a
mule
,
with
Francois
upon
a
horse
with
my
portmanteau
behind
him
,
and
the
owner
of
both
,
stride
the
way
before
us
,
with
a
long
gun
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
a
sword
under
his
arm
,
l
peradventure
we
should
run
away
with
his
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
see
my
breech
in
enter
Avignon
,
 
<EOS>
though
you
would
have
see
them
better
,
I
think
,
as
I
mount
 
you
would
not
have
think
the
precaution
amiss
,
or
find
in
your
heart
to
have
take
it
in
dudgeon
;
for
my
own
part
,
I
take
it
most
kindly
;
and
determine
to
make
him
a
present
of
them
,
when
we
get
to
the
end
of
our
journey
,
for
the
trouble
they
have
put
him
to
,
of
arm
himself
at
all
point
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
go
further
,
let
me
get
rid
of
my
remark
upon
Avignon
,
which
be
this
:
 
that
I
think
it
wrong
,
merely
because
a
man
's
hat
have
be
blow
off
his
head
by
chance
the
first
night
he
come
to
Avignon
,
 
that
he
should
therefore
say
,
"
Avignon
be
more
subject
to
high
wind
than
any
town
in
all
France
:
"
 
for
which
reason
I
lay
no
stress
upon
the
accident
till
I
have
enquire
of
the
master
of
the
inn
about
it
,
who
tell
me
seriously
it
be
so
 
and
hear
,
moreover
,
the
windiness
of
Avignon
speak
of
in
the
country
about
as
a
proverb
 
<EOS>
I
set
it
down
,
merely
to
ask
the
learn
what
can
be
the
cause
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
I
see
 
<EOS>
for
they
be
all
Dukes
,
Marquisses
,
and
Counts
,
there
 
the
duce
a
Baron
,
in
all
Avignon
 
so
that
there
be
scarce
any
talk
to
them
on
a
windy
day
.
  
<EOS>
Prithee
,
friend
,
say
I
,
take
hold
of
my
mule
for
a
moment
 
for
I
want
to
pull
off
one
of
my
jack
-
boot
,
which
hurt
my
heel
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
stand
quite
idle
at
the
door
of
the
inn
,
and
as
I
have
take
it
into
my
head
,
he
be
someway
concerned
about
the
house
or
stable
<EOS>
,
I
put
the
bridle
into
his
hand
 
<EOS>
so
begin
with
the
boot
:
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
finish
the
affair
,
I
turn
about
to
take
the
mule
from
the
man
,
and
thank
him
      
<EOS>
but
Monsieur
le
Marquis
have
walk
in
      
<EOS>
I
have
now
the
whole
south
of
France
,
from
the
bank
of
the
Rhone
to
those
of
the
Garonne
,
to
traverse
upon
my
mule
at
my
own
leisure
 
at
my
own
leisure
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
leave
Death
,
the
Lord
know
 
and
He
only
 
how
far
behind
me
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
follow
many
a
man
thro
"
<EOS>
France
,
quoth
<EOS>
he
 
but
never
at
this
mettlesome
rate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
still
he
follow
,
 
and
still
I
flee
him
 
<EOS>
but
I
flee
him
cheerfully
 
<EOS>
still
he
pursue
 
<EOS>
but
,
like
one
who
pursue
his
prey
without
hope
 
as
he
lagg'd
,
every
step
he
lose
,
soften
his
look
 
<EOS>
why
should
I
fly
him
at
this
rate
?
  
<EOS>
so
notwithstanding
all
the
commissary
of
the
post
-
office
have
say
,
I
change
the
mode
of
my
travelling
once
more
;
and
,
after
so
precipitate
and
rattle
a
course
as
I
have
run
,
I
flatter
my
fancy
with
thinking
of
my
mule
,
and
that
I
should
traverse
the
rich
plain
of
Languedoc
upon
his
back
,
as
slowly
as
foot
could
fall
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
pleasing
to
a
traveller
 
or
more
terrible
to
travel-
writers
,
than
a
large
rich
plain
;
especially
if
it
be
without
great
river
or
bridge
;
and
present
nothing
to
the
eye
,
but
one
unvaried
picture
of
plenty
:
 
for
after
they
have
once
tell
you
,
that
'
tis
delicious
!
<EOS>
or
delightful
!
<EOS>
(
as
the
case
happen
)
 
that
the
soil
be
grateful
,
and
that
nature
pour
out
all
her
abundance
,
&
c.
.
<EOS>
.they
have
then
a
large
plain
upon
their
hand
,
which
they
know
not
what
to
do
with
 
and
which
be
of
little
or
no
use
to
them
but
to
carry
them
to
some
town
;
and
that
town
,
perhaps
of
little
more
,
but
a
new
place
to
start
from
to
the
next
plain
  
and
so
on

<EOS>
this
be
most
terrible
work
;
judge
if
I
do
not
manage
my
plain
better
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
not
go
above
two
league
and
a
half
,
before
the
man
with
his
gun
begin
to
look
at
his
priming

<EOS>
I
have
three
several
time
loiter'd
terribly
behind
;
half
a
mile
at
least
every
time
;
once
,
in
deep
conference
with
a
drum
-
maker
,
who
be
make
drum
for
the
fair
of
Baucaira
and
Tarascone
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
the
principle
    
<EOS>
the
second
time
,
I
can
not
so
properly
say
,
I
stopp'd
 
for
meet
a
couple
of
Franciscans
straiten
more
for
time
than
myself
,
and
not
be
able
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
I
be
about
 
<EOS>
I
have
turn'd
<EOS>
back
with
them
    
<EOS>
the
third
,
be
an
affair
of
trade
with
a
gossip
,
for
a
hand
-
basket
of
Provence
fig
for
four
sous
;
this
would
have
be
transact
at
once
;
but
for
a
case
of
conscience
at
the
close
of
it
;
for
when
the
fig
be
pay
for
,
it
turn'd
out
,
that
there
be
two
dozen
of
egg
cover
over
with
vine
-
leave
at
the
bottom
of
the
basket
 
as
I
have
no
intention
of
buy
egg
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
sort
of
claim
of
them
 
as
for
the
space
they
have
occupy
  
what
signify
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
fig
enow
for
my
money
      
<EOS>
but
it
be
my
intention
to
have
the
basket
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
gossip
's
intention
to
keep
it
,
without
which
,
she
could
do
nothing
with
her
egg
 
and
unless
I
have
the
basket
,
I
could
do
as
little
with
my
fig
,
which
be
too
ripe
already
,
and
most
of
'em
burst
at
the
side
:
 
<EOS>
this
bring
on
a
short
contention
,
which
terminate
in
sundry
proposal
,
<EOS>
what
we
should
both
do
      
<EOS>
how
we
dispose
of
our
egg
and
fig
,
I
defy
you
,
or
the
Devil
himself
,
<EOS>
have
he
not
be
there
(
which
I
be
persuade
he
be
)
,
to
form
the
least
probable
conjecture
:
 
<EOS>
You
will
read
the
whole
of
it
 
not
this

for
I
be
hasten
to
the
story

my

Toby

amours
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
read
it
in
the
collection
of
those
which
have
arise
out
of
the
journey
across
this

which
<EOS>
,
therefore

I

to
be
let
by

into

<EOS>
but
the
truth
be
,
my

Toby
be
not
a

;
he
drink
it
neither
pure

mix'd
,
or
any
how

fortuitously
upon
some
advanced

where
well
liquor
be

it

<EOS>
now
as
all
the

know
,
that
no
effect

can
be
produce
without

as
it
be

know

that
my

be
neither
a

<EOS>
unless
as
a

you
will
needs
have
him
one
 
<EOS>
but
then
he
be
only
a
captain
of
foot
 
and
besides
,
the
whole
be
an
equivocation
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
leave
for
us
to
suppose
,
but
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
leg
 
<EOS>
but
that
will
avail
us
little
in
the
present
hypothesis
,
unless
it
have
proceed
from
some
ailment
in
the
foot
 
<EOS>
whereas
his
leg
be
not
emaciate
from
any
disorder
in
his
foot
 
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
leg
be
not
emaciate
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
stiff

awkward
,
from
a
total
disuse
of
it

for
the
three

he
lie
confine

it

I

do
not

it

let

not

<EOS>
let

take
the

straight

it

nice

at
once
,
but
at
the
same
time
the
most
natural
kick
that
could
be
kick'd
<EOS>
in
her
situation
 
for
supposing
.........
to
be
the
sun
in
its
meridian
,
it
be
a
north
-
east
kick
 
<EOS>
she
kick'd
<EOS>
the
pin
out
of
her
finger
 
the
etiquette
which
hang
upon
it
,
down
 
down
<EOS>
it
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
be
shiver'd
into
a
thousand
atom
.
  
<EOS>
from
all
which
it
be
plain
that
widow
Wadman
be
in
love
with
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
head
at
that
time
be
full
of
other
matter
,
so
that
it
be
not
till
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
when
all
the
other
civility
of
Europe
be
settle
,
that
he
find
leisure
to
return
this
.
  
<EOS>
this
make
an
armistice
(
that
is
,
speak
with
regard
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
with
respect
to
Mrs.
Wadman
,
a
vacancy
)
 
of
almost
eleven
year
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
all
case
of
this
nature
,
as
it
be
the
second
blow
,
happen
at
what
distance
of
time
it
will
,
which
make
the
fray
 
<EOS>
I
chuse
for
that
reason
to
call
these
the
amour
of
my
uncle
Toby
with
Mrs.
Wadman
,
rather
than
the
amours
of
Mrs.
Wadman
with
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
a
distinction
without
a
difference
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
like
the
affair
of
an
old
hat
<EOS>
cock'd
 
and
a
cock'd
old
hat
,
about
which
your
reverence
have
so
often
be
at
odd
with
one
another
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
difference
here
in
the
nature
of
thing
    
<EOS>
and
let
me
tell
you
,
gentry
,
a
wide
one
too
.
    
<EOS>
now
as
widow
Wadman
do
love
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
and
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
do
not
love
widow
Wadman
,
there
be
nothing
for
widow
Wadman
to
do
,
but
to
go
on
and
love
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
or
let
it
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Widow
Wadman
would
do
neither
the
one
or
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
Gracious
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
forget
I
be
a
little
of
her
temper
myself
;
for
whenever
it
so
fall
out
,
which
it
sometimes
do
about
the
equinox
,
that
an
earthly
goddess
be
so
much
this
,
and
that
,
and
t'other
,
that
I
can
not
eat
my
breakfast
for
her
 
and
that
she
careth
not
three
halfpence
whether
I
eat
my
breakfast
or
no
      
Curse
on
her
!
<EOS>
and
so
I
send
her
to
Tartary
,
and
from
Tartary
to
terra
del
Fuogo
,
and
so
on
to
the
devil
:
 
in
short
,
there
be
not
an
infernal
nitch
where
I
do
not
take
her
divinityship
and
stick
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
the
heart
be
tender
,
and
the
passion
in
these
tide
ebb
and
flow
ten
time
in
a
minute
,
I
instantly
bring
her
back
again
;
and
as
I
do
all
thing
in
extreme
,
I
place
her
in
the
very
center
of
the
milky
-
way
    
Brightest
of

<EOS>
thou
wilt
shed
thy
influence
upon
some
one
      
<EOS>
the

take
her
and
her
influence
too
 
for
at
that
word
<EOS>
I
lose
all
patience
 
much
good
<EOS>
may
it
do
him
!
 
<EOS>
by
all
that
be
hirsute
and
gashly

<EOS>
I
cry
,
take
off
my
furr'd
cap
,
and
twist
it
<EOS>
round
my
finger
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
give
sixpence
for
a

such

<EOS>
but
'
tis
an
excellent

(
put
it
upon
my

and
press
it
close

and
warm
 
and
soft
;
especially
if
you
stroke
it
the

<EOS>
but
alas

<EOS>
that
will
never

<EOS>

so

<EOS>
no

I

nothing

<EOS>

I
tell

from
the
first
creation

motion
(
and
with
more

than
they
usually
do
thing

kind

,
establish
such
a
chain
of
cause
and
effect
hang
so
fast
to
one
another
,
that
it
be
scarce
possible
for
my
uncle
Toby
to
have
dwell
in
any
other
house
in
the
world
,
or
to
have
occupy
any
other
garden
in
Christendom
,
but
the
very
house

garden
which
join'd
and
lay
parallel
to
Mrs.

this
,
with
the
advantage
of
a

Love

she
could
observe
my

motion

be
mistress
likewise
of
his
council
of
war
;
and
as
his
unsuspecting
heart
have
give
leave
to
the
corporal
,
through
the
mediation
of
Bridget
,
to
make
her
a
wicker

gate
of
communication
to
enlarge
her
walk

it
enable
her
to
carry
on
her
approach
to
the
very
door

sentry

;
and
sometimes
out
of
gratitude
,
to
make
an
attack
,
and
endeavour
to
blow
my
uncle
Toby
up
in
the
very
sentry
-
box
itself
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
pity
 
<EOS>
but
'
tis
<EOS>
certain
from
every

's
observation
of
man

that
he
may
be
set
on
fire
like

at

there

there

there

as
the
flame
in
that
case
have
the
misfortune
generally
to
put
out
itself
 
there
be
an
end

<EOS>
for
my
part
,
could
I
always
have
the
ordering
of
it
which
way
I
would
be
burn
myself
 
for
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
be
burn
like
a
beast
 
<EOS>
I
would
oblige
a
housewife
constantly
to
light
me
at

for
then
I
should
burn
down
decently
to
the
socket

that
is

from

my

from

from

so
on

through

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I
beseech

quoth
<EOS>
my

to

I

<EOS>
that

I
know

quoth
my

<EOS>
and
so
to
make
sure
of
both
system
,
Mrs.
Wadman
predetermine
to
light
my
uncle
Toby
neither
at
this
end
or
that
;
but
,
like
a
prodigal

to
light
him
,
if
possible
,
at
both
end
at

<EOS>
now

both
of

,
from
the
great
arsenal
of
Venice

,
if
Mrs.
Wadman
have
be
rummage
for
seven
year
together

and
with
Bridget
to
help
her

she
could
not
have
find
any

so
fit

purpose
,
as
that
which
the
expediency
of
my

Toby

affair
have
fix'd
up
ready
to
her
hand

<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
not
tell
you
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
possibly
I
have
 
be
it
as
it
will
,
'
tis
one
of
the
number
of
those
many
thing
,
which
a
man
have
better
do
over
again
,
than
dispute
about
it
 
<EOS>
that
whatever
town
or
fortress
the
corporal
be
at
work
upon
,
during
the
course
of
their
campaign
,
my
uncle
Toby
always
take
care
,
on
the
inside
of
his
sentry
-
box
,
which
be
towards
his
left
hand
,
to
have
a
plan
of
the
place
,
<EOS>
fasten'd
up
with
two
or
three
pin
at

the
conveniency
of
hold
it
up

&
c.

<EOS>
.as
<EOS>
occasion
require
;
so
that
when
an

resolve
upon

Mrs.

have
nothing
more
to
do
,
when
she
have
get
advance
to
the
door
of
the
sentry

,
but
to
extend
her
right
hand
;
and
edge
in
her
left
foot
at
the

movement

to
take
hold
of
the

whatever
it
be

and
with
out

stretch
neck
meeting
it
<EOS>
half
way

to
advance
it
towards
her
<EOS>
;
on
which
my
uncle
Toby
's
passion
be
sure
to
catch
fire
 
for
he
would
instantly
take
hold
of
the
other
corner
of
the
map
in
his
left
hand
,
and
with
the
end
of
his
pipe
in
the
other
,
begin
an
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
attack
be
advance
to
this
point
;
 
the
world
will
naturally
enter
into
the
reason
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
next
stroke
of
generalship
 
which
be
,
to
take
my
uncle
Toby
's
tobacco
-
pipe
out
of
his
hand
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could
;
which
,
under
one
pretence
or
other
,
but
generally
that
of
point
more
distinctly
at
some
redoubt
or
breastwork
in
the
map
,
she
would
effect
before
my
uncle
Toby
(
poor
soul

<EOS>
have
well
<EOS>
march'd
above
half
a
dozen
toise
with
it

<EOS>
It
oblige
my
uncle
Toby
to
make
use
of
his
forefinger
.
  
<EOS>
the
difference
it
make
in
the
attack
be
this
;
that
in
go
upon
it
,
as
in
the
first
case
,
with
the
end
of
her
fore
-
finger
against
the
end
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
tobacco
-
pipe
,
she
may
have
travel
with
it
,
along
the
line
,
from
Dan
to
Beersheba
,
have
my
uncle
Toby
's
line
<EOS>
reach'd
<EOS>
so
far
,
without
any
effect
:
 
for
as
there
be
no
arterial
or
vital
heat
in
the
end
of
the
tobacco
-
pipe
,
it
could
excite
no
sentiment
 
<EOS>
it
could
neither
give
fire
by
pulsation
 
or
receive
it
by
sympathy
 
<EOS>
'
twas
nothing
but
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
whereas
,
in
follow
my
uncle
Toby
's
forefinger
with
her
,
close
thro
'
all
the
little
turn
and
indenting
of
his
work
 
press
sometimes
against
the
side
of
it
 
then
tread
upon
its
nail
 
then
trip
it
up
 
then
touch
it
here
 
then
there
,
<EOS>
and
so
on
 
it
set
something
at

in
motion
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
tho
'
slight
skirmishing
,
and
at
a
distance
from
the
main
body
,
yet
draw
on
the
rest
;
for
here
,
the
map
usually
fall
with
the
back
of
it
,
close
to
the
side
of
the
sentry
-
box
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
the
simplicity
of
his
soul
,
would
lay
his
hand
flat
upon

in

to
go
on

his
explanation

and
Mrs.
Wadman
,
by
a
manoeuvre
as
quick
as
thought

would
as
certainly
place
her
's
close
beside
it

this
at
once
open
a
communication

large
enough
for
any
sentiment
to
pass

Thine

<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
have
it
ever
to
take
up
,
or
,
with
the
gentle
pushing
,
protrusion
,
and
equivocal
compression
,
that
a
hand
to
be
remove
be
capable
of
receive
 
to
get
it
<EOS>
press'd
<EOS>
a
hair
breadth
of
one
side
out
of
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
this
be
do
,
how
could
she
forget
to
make
him
sensible
,
that
it
be
her
leg
(
and
no
one
be
else
)
at
the
bottom
of
the
sentry
-
box
,
which
slightly
press'd
against
the
calf
of
his
 
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
be
thus
attack'd
and
sore
push'd
on
both
his
wing
 
be
it
a
wonder
,
if
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
it
put
his
centre
into
disorder
?
      
<EOS>
the
duce
take
it
!
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
these
attack
of
Mrs.
Wadman
,
you
will
readily
conceive
to
be
of
different
kind
;
vary
from
each
other
,
like
the
attack
which
history
be
full
of
,
and
from
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
a
general
looker
-
on
would
scarce
allow
them
to
be
attack
at
all
 
<EOS>
or
if
he
do
,
would
confound
them
all
together
 
<EOS>
but
I
write
not
to
them
:
 
it
will
be
time
enough
to
be
a
little
more
exact
in
my
description
of
them
,
as
I
come
up
to
them
,
which
will
not
be
for
some
chapter
;
have
nothing
more
to
add
in
this
,
but
that
in
a
bundle
of
original
paper
and
drawing
which
my
father
take
care
to
roll
up
by
themselves
,
there
be
a
plan
of
Bouchain
in
perfect
preservation
(
and
shall
be
keep
so
,
whilst
I
have
power
to
preserve
any
thing
)
,
upon
the
low
corner
of
which
,
<EOS>
on
the
right
hand
side
,
there
be
still
remain
the
mark
of
a
snuffy
finger
and
thumb
,
which
there
be
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
imagine
,
be
Mrs.
Wadman
's
;
for
the
opposite
side
of
the
margin
,
which
I
suppose
to
have
be
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
be
absolutely
clean
:
 
<EOS>
this
seem
an
authenticated
record
of
one
of
these
attack
;
for
there
be
vestigia
of
the
two
puncture
partly
grow
up
,
but
still
visible
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
map
,
which
be
unquestionably
the
very
hole
,
through
which
it
have
be
prick
up
in
the
sentry
-
box
    
by
all
that
be
priestly
!
<EOS>
I
value
this
precious
relick
,
with
its
stigmata
and
prick
,
more
than
all
the
relick
of
the
romish
church
 
always
except
,
when
I
be
write
upon
these
matter
,
the
prick
which
enter
the
flesh
of
St.
Radagunda
in
the
desert
,
which
in
your
road
from
Fesse
to
Cluny
,
the
nun
of
that
name
will
shew
you
for
love
.
    
<EOS>
I
think
,
an
'

your
honour
,
quoth
Trim
,
the
fortification
be
quite
destroy
 
and
the
bason
be
upon
a
level
with
the
mole
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
;
reply
my
uncle
Toby
with
a
sigh
half
suppress'd
 
but
step
into
the
parlour
,
Trim
,
for
the
stipulation
 
<EOS>
it
lie
upon
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
lain
there
these
six
week
,
reply
the
corporal
,
till
this
very
morning
that
the
old
woman
kindle
the
fire
with
it
      
then
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
further
occasion
for
our
service
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
,
an
'
please
your

,
the
pity
,
say
the
corporal
;
in
utter
which
he
cast
his
spade
into
the
wheel
-
barrow
,
which
be
beside
him
,
with
an
air
the
most
expressive
of
disconsolation
that
can
be
imagine
,
and
be
heavily
turn
about
to
look
for
his
pickax
,
his
pioneer
's
shovel
,
his
picquet
,
and
other
little
military
store
,
in
order
to
carry
them
off
the
field
 
when
a
heigh
-
ho

<EOS>
from
the
sentry

box
,
which
be
make
of
thin
slit
deal
,
reverberate
the
sound
more
sorrowfully
to
his
ear
,
forbad
him
.
    
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
say
the
corporal
to
himself
,
I
will
do
it
before
his
honour
rise
to-
<EOS>
morrow
morning
;
so
take
his
spade
out
of
the
wheel
-
barrow
again
,
with
a
little
earth
in
it
,
as
if
to
level
something
at
the
foot
of
the
glacis
 
but
with
a
real
intent
to
approach
nearer
to
his
master
,
in
order
to
divert
him
 
he
loosen'd
<EOS>
a
sod
or
two
 
pare
their
edge
with
his
spade
,
and
have
give
them
a
gentle
blow
or
two
with
the
back
of
it
,
he
sit
himself
down
close
by
my
uncle
Toby
's
foot
and
begin
as
follow
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
a
thousand
pity
 
<EOS>
though
I
believe
,
an

cry
my

the

be
no

from

Trim

than

the

my

give
a
nod

<EOS>
It

then
,
say
the

cast
his
eye
upon
Dunkirk
,
and
the
mole
,
as
Servius
Sulpicius
,
in

out
of
Asia

<EOS>
Thou

my

<EOS>
this

continue
the

be
the
reason

that
from
the

I
have
never

Thou

thou

<EOS>
I

Trim

I

the

It

It

then
I

the

it

easy
a

as
the

imagine
,
to
pull
off
a
lank
Montero

cap
with
grace
 
or
a
whit
less
difficult
,
in
my
conception
,
when
a
man
be
sit
squat
upon
the
ground
,
to
make
a
bow
so
teem
with
respect
as
the

be
will
not
;
yet
by
suffer
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
,
which
be
towards
his
master
,
to
slip
backwards
upon
the
grass
,
a
little
beyond
his
body
,
in
order
to
allow
it
the
great
sweep
 
and
by
an
unforced
compression
,
at
the

time
,
of
his
cap
with
the
thumb
and
the
two
forefinger
of
his
left
,
by
which
the
diameter
of
the
cap
become
reduce
,
so
that
it
may
be
say
,
rather
to
be
insensibly
squeez'd
 
<EOS>
than
<EOS>
pull'd
off
with
a
flatus
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
acquit
himself
of
both
in
a
well
manner
than
the
posture
of
his

promise
;
and
have
hem
twice

to
find
in
what
key
his

would
best
go

good
suit
his

exchange

for

he

interrogatively

<EOS>
Trim
take
it
up
with
the

cast
a
glance
of
humiliation
as

upon

Thou

Trim

say
my
uncle
Toby

for

for
geography

'

of
absolute
use
to
him

he
must
be
acquaint
intimately
with
every
country

he

every

hamlet

with
the
canal
,
the
road

hollow
way
which
lead
up
to
them

there
be
not
a
river

a

Trim

<EOS>
what

its
course
  
how
far
it
be
navigable
 
<EOS>
where
fordable
 
where
not

he
should
know
the
fertility
of
every
valley
,
as
well
as
the
hind
who
plough
it
;
and
be
able
to
describe

if

to

warm

of
his

how
Marlborough
could
have

as
for
Chronology

I

Trim

continue
my

Toby

sit
down
again
coolly
in
his
sentry

box

that
of
all
other

it
seem
a
science
which
the

may

spare

be
it
not
for
the
light
which
that
science
must
one

give

in
determine
the
invention
of
powder
;
the
furious
execution
of
which
,
renverse
every

like
thunder
before

have
become
a
new
aera
to
us
of
military
improvement
,
change
so
totally
the
nature
of
attack
and
defence
both
by
sea
and
land
,
and
awaken
so
much
art
and
skill
in
do
it
,
that
the
world
can
not
be
too
exact
in
ascertain
the
precise
time
of
its
discovery
,
or
too
inquisitive
in
know
what
great

the

birth
to
it

<EOS>
I
be
far
from
controverting
,
continue
my
uncle
Toby
,
what
historian
agree
in
,
that
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
1380
,
under
the
reign
of
Wencelaus
,
son
of
Charles
the
Fourth
 
<EOS>
a
certain
priest
,
whose
name
be
Schwartz
,
shew'd
<EOS>
the
use
of
powder
to
the
Venetians
,
in
their
war
against
the
Genoese
;
but
'
tis
certain
he
be
not
the
first
;
because
if
we
be
to
believe
Don
Pedro

the
bishop
of
Leon

how
come
priest

in

that
in

1343

both
by
Moors

not

in

at

period

in
many
of
their
most
memorable
siege
in
Spain

Barbary

all
the

that
Friar
Bacon
have
write
expressly
about
it

the

above
a
hundred

fifty

in

as
be
plain
to
me
from
the

miserable
state
of
military

amongst

nothing

!
<EOS>
cry
my
uncle
Toby
,
catch
up
with
enthusiasm
 
this
moment
,
now
that
all
be
lose
,
I
see
him
gallop
across
me
,
corporal
,
to
the
left
,
to
bring
up
the
remain
of
the
english
horse
along
with
him
to
support
the
right
,
and
tear
the
laurel
from
Luxembourg
's
brow
,
if
yet
'
tis
possible
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
with
the
knot
of
his
scarfe
<EOS>
just
shoot
off
,
infuse
fresh
spirit
into
poor
Galway
's
regiment
 
ride
along
the
line
 
then
wheel
about
,
and
charge
Conti
at
the
head
of
it
 
brave
,
brave
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
cry
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
he
deserve
a
crown
 
<EOS>
as
richly
,
as
a
thief
a
halter
;
shout
Trim
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
know
the
corporal
's
loyalty
;
 
otherwise
the
comparison
be
not
at
all
to
his
mind
 
<EOS>
it
do
not
altogether
strike
the
corporal
's
fancy
when
he
have
make
it
 
<EOS>
but
it
could
not
be
<EOS>
recall'd
 
<EOS>
so
he
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
number
of
wound
be
prodigious
,
and
no
one
have
time
to
think
of
any
thing
but
his
own
safety
 
<EOS>
though
Talmash
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
bring
off
the
foot
with
great
prudence
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
leave
upon
the
field
,
say
the
corporal
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wast
<EOS>
so
;
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
reply
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
so
that
it
be
noon
the
next
day
,
continue
the
corporal
,
before
I
be
exchange
,
and
put
into
a
cart
with
thirteen
or
fourteen
more
,
in
order
to
be
convey'd
to
our
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
part
of
the
body
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
where
a
wound
occasion
more
intolerable
anguish
than
upon
the
knee
    
<EOS>
except
the
groin
;
say
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
an
'
please
your
honour
,
reply
the
corporal
,
<EOS>
the
knee
,
in
my
opinion
,
must
certainly
be
the
most
acute
,
there
be
so
many
tendon
and
what
-
d'ye
-
call-'ems
all
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
for
that
reason
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
the
groin
be
infinitely
more
sensible
 
there
be
not
only
as
many
tendon
and
what
-
d'ye
-
call-'ems
(
for
I
know
their
name
as
little
as
thou
dost
)
 
about
it
 
<EOS>
but
moreover
...
    
Mrs.
Wadman
,
who
have
be
all
the
time
in
her
arbour
 
instantly
stopp'd
<EOS>
her
breath
 
unpinn'd
her
mob
at
the
chin
,
and
stand
upon
one
leg
    
<EOS>
the
dispute
be
maintain
with
amicable
and
equal
force
betwixt
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
for
some
time
<EOS>
;
till
Trim
at
length
recollecting
that
he
have
often
cry
at
his
master
's
suffering
,
but
never
shed
a
tear
at
his
own
  
be
for
give
up
the
point
,
which
my
uncle
Toby
would
not
allow
 
'
Tis
a
proof
of
nothing
,
Trim
,
say
he
,
but
the
generosity
of
thy
temper
    
so
that
whether
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
groin
(
caeteris
paribus
)
be
great
than
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
knee
 
or
  
whether
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
knee
be
not
great
than
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
groin
 
be
point
which
to
this
day
remain
unsettled
.
    
<EOS>
the
anguish
of
my
knee
,
continue
the
corporal
,
be
excessive
in
itself
;
and
the
uneasiness
of
the
cart
,
with
the
roughness
of
the
road
,
which
be
terribly
cut
up
 
make
bad
still
bad
 
<EOS>
every
step
be
death
to
me
:
 
so
that
with
the
loss
of
blood
,
and
the
want
of
care
-
taking
of
me
,
and
a
fever
I
feel
come
on
besides
 
(
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
)
 
<EOS>
all
together
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
be
more
than
I
could
sustain
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
tell
my
suffering
to
a
young
woman
at
a
peasant
's
house
,
where
our
cart
,
which
be
the
last
of
the
line
,
have
halt
;
they
have
help'd
me
in
,
and
the
young
woman
have
take
a
cordial
out
of
her
pocket
and
dropp'd
<EOS>
it
upon
some
sugar
,
and
see
it
have
<EOS>
cheer'd
<EOS>
me
,
she
have
give
it
me
a
second
and
<EOS>
a
third
time
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
tell
her
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
the
anguish
I
be
in
,
and
be
say
it
be
so
intolerable
to
me
,
that
I
have
much
rather
lie
down
upon
the
bed
,
turn
my
face
towards
one
which
be
in
the
corner
of
the
room
 
and
die
,
than
go
on
 
when
,
upon
her
attempt
to
lead
me
to
it
,
I
faint
away
in
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
good
soul
!
<EOS>
as
your
honour
,
say
the
corporal
,
wipe
his
eye
,
will
hear
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
love
have
be
a
joyous
thing
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
<EOS>
the
most
serious
thing
,
an
'
please
your
honour
(
sometimes
)
,
that
be
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
persuasion
of
the
young
woman
,
continue
the
corporal
,
the
cart
with
the
wound
man
set
off
without
me
:
 
<EOS>
she
have
assure
them
I
should
expire
immediately
if
I
be
put
into
the
cart
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
I
come
to
myself
 
I
find
myself
in
a
still
quiet
cottage
,
with
no
one
but
the
young
woman
,
and
the
peasant
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
lay
across
the
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
,
with
my
wound
leg
upon
a
chair
,
and
the
young
woman
beside
me
,
hold
the
corner
of
her
handkerchief
dipp'd
in
vinegar
to
my
nose
with
one
hand
,
and
rub
my
temple
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
her
at
first
for
the
daughter
of
the
peasant
(
for
it
be
no
inn
)
 
<EOS>
so
have
offer'd
<EOS>
her
a
little
purse
with
eighteen
florin
,
which
my
poor
brother
Tom
<EOS>
(
here
trim
wip'd
his
eye
)
have
send
me
as
a
token
,
by
a
recruit
,
just
before
he
set
out
for
Lisbon
      
<EOS>
I
never
tell
your
honour
that
piteous
story
yet
 
here
<EOS>
Trim
wipe
his
eye
a
third
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
woman
call'd
the
old
man
and
his
wife
into
the
room
,
to
shew
them
the
money
,
in
order
to
gain
me
credit
for
a
bed
and
<EOS>
what
little
necessary
I
should
want
,
till
I
should
be
in
a
condition
to
be
get
to
the
hospital
  
<EOS>
come
then
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
tie
up
the
little
purse
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
your
banker
 
<EOS>
but
as
that
office
alone
will
not
keep
me
employ'd
,
I
will
be
your
nurse
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
by
her
manner
of
speak
this
,
as
well
as
by
her
dress
,
which
I
then
begin
to
consider
more
attentively
 
that
the
young
woman
could
not
be
the
daughter
of
the
peasant
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
black
down
to
her
toe
,
with
<EOS>
her
hair
conceal'd
<EOS>
under
a
cambric
border
,
lay
close
to
her
forehead
:
 
<EOS>
she
be
one
of
those
kind
of
nun
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
of
which
,
your
honour
know
,
there
be
a
good
many
in
flander
,
which
they
let
go
loose
 
<EOS>
by
thy
description
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
she
be
a
young
Beguine
,
of
which
there
be
none
to
be
find
any
where
but
in
the
spanish
Netherlands
 
except
at
Amsterdam
 
<EOS>
they
differ
from
nun
in
this
,
that
they
can
quit
their
cloister
if
they
choose
to
marry
;
they
visit
and
take
care
of
the
sick
by
profession
 
<EOS>
I
have
rather
,
for
my
own
part
,
they
do
it
out
of
good
-
nature
.
    
<EOS>
She
often
tell
me
,
quoth
Trim
,
she
do
it
for
the
love
of
Christ
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
trim
,
we
be
both
wrong
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
we
will
ask
Mr.
Yorick
about
it
to
-
night
at
my
brother
Shandy
's
 
<EOS>
so
put
me
in
mind
;
add
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
Beguine
,
continue
the
corporal
,
have
scarce
give
herself
time
to
tell
me
"
she
would
be
my
nurse
,
"
when
she
hastily
turn
about
to
begin
the
office
of
one
,
and
prepare
something
for
me
 
and
in
a
short
time
 
though
I
think
it
a
long
one
 
<EOS>
she
come
back
with
flannel
,
&
c.
&
c.
and
have
foment
my
knee
soundly
for
a
couple
of
hour
,
&
c.
and
make
me
a
thin
bason
of
gruel
for
my
supper
 
she
<EOS>
wish'd
me
rest
,
and
promise
to
be
with
me
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
<EOS>
wish'd
me
,
an
'

your
honour
,
what
be
not
to

<EOS>
My
fever
run
very
high
that
night
 
her
figure
make
sad
disturbance
within
me
 
<EOS>
I
be
every
moment
cut
the
world
in
two
 
to
give
her
half
of
it
 
and
every
moment
be
I
cry
,
that
I
have
nothing
but
a
knapsack
and
eighteen
florin
to
share
with
her
 
<EOS>
the
whole
night
long
be
the
fair
Beguine
,
like
an
angel
,
close
by
my
bed
-
side
,
hold
back
my
curtain
and
offer
me
cordial
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
only
awaken
from
my
dream
by
her
come
there
at
the
hour
promise
,
and
give
them
in
reality
.
 
<EOS>
in
truth
,
she
be
scarce
ever
from
me
;
and
so
accustomed
be
I
to
receive
life
from
her
hand
,
that
my
heart
sicken
,
and
I
lose
colour
when
she
leave
the
room
:
 
and
yet
,
continue
the
corporal
(
make
one
of
the
strange
reflection
upon
it
in
the
world
)
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
love
"
 
for
during
the
three
week
she
be
almost
constantly
with
me
,
foment
my
knee
with
her
hand
,
night
and
day
 
<EOS>
I
can
honestly
say
,
an
'

that
.
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
that
be
very
odd
,
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
 
say
Mrs.
Wadman
.
  
<EOS>
It
never
do
,
say
the
corporal

<EOS>
but
'

continue
the

see
my

Toby
musing
upon

for
Love

that
a

week
complete

shoot
through
his

with
this

that
it

on

in
the
afternoon

when
I

all
at

with
a
sisserara
 
<EOS>
It
burst
upon
me
,
an

<EOS>
scarce
give
me
time
to
say
,
"
God
bless

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
Trim
,
say
my

a
man
never
fall
in

so
very
suddenly

<EOS>
yes

my

inform
me
how
this
matter
happen
.
    
<EOS>
with
all
pleasure

say
the

make
a
bow

<EOS>
I
have
escape

continue
the
corporal

all
that
time
from
fall
in

and
have
go
on
to
the

of
the
chapter
,
<EOS>
have
it
not

predestine
otherwise
 
<EOS>
there
be
no

our
fate

<EOS>
It
be
on
a
Sunday
,
in
the
afternoon
,
as
I
tell
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
and
his
wife
have
walk
out
    
<EOS>
every
thing
be
still
and
hush
as
midnight
about
the
house
    
<EOS>
there
be
not
so
much
as
a
duck
or
a
duckle
about
the
yard
      
<EOS>
when
the
fair
Beguine
come
in
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
wound
be
then
in
a
fair
way
of
do
well
 
<EOS>
the
inflammation
have
be
go
off
for
some
time
,
but
it
be
succeed
with
an
itching
both
above
and
below
my
knee
,
so
insufferable
,
that
I
have
not
shut
my
eye
the
whole
night
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
see
it
,
say
she
,
kneel
down
upon
the
ground
parallel
to
my
knee
,
and
lay
her
hand
upon
the
part
below
it
 
<EOS>
it
only
want
rub
a
little
,
say
the
Beguine
;
so
cover
it
with
the
bed
-
clothe
,
she
begin
with
the
fore
-
finger
of
her
right
hand
to
rub
under
my
knee
,
guide
her
fore
-
finger
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
edge
of
the
flannel
which
keep
on
the
dressing
.
  
<EOS>
in
five
or
six
minute
I
feel
slightly
the
end
of
her
second
finger
 
<EOS>
and
presently
it
be
lay
flat
with
the
other
,
and
<EOS>
she
continue
rub
in
that
way
round
and
round
for
a
good
while
;
it
then
come
into
my
head
,
that
I
should
fall
in
love
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
blush'd
<EOS>
when
I
see
how
white
a
hand
<EOS>
she
have
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never

,
behold
another
hand
so
white
<EOS>
whilst
I
live
      
<EOS>
not
in
that
place
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
    
<EOS>
though
it
be
the
most
serious
despair
in
nature
to
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
forbear
smile
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
Beguine
,
continue
the
corporal
,
perceive
it
be
of
great
service
to
me
 
from
rub
for
some
time
,
with
two
finger
 
proceed
to
rub
at
length
,
with
three
 
till
by
little
and
little
she
bring
down
the
fourth
,
and
then
rubb'd
with
her

hand
:
 
I
will
never

again
 
<EOS>

it

Prithee

Trim
<EOS>

his

the

the

continue
rub
with
her
whole
hand
under
my

I
fear'd
<EOS>
her
zeal
would
weary
her
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
do
a
thousand
time
more
,
"
say
she
,
"
for
the
love
of
Christ

<EOS>
in

which

she
pass'd
her
hand
across
the
flannel

to
the
part
above
my
knee

which
I
have
equally
complain'd
of

and
rubb'd
it
also

<EOS>
I
perceiv'd
,
then
,
I
be
begin
to
be
in
love
    
<EOS>
as
she
continue
rub
-
rub

rubbing
 
I

an

my

I

seiz'd
her

<EOS>
and
then
thou
clapped'st
it
to
thy

,
Trim
,
say
my

<EOS>
Toby
 
and
madest
a
speech
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
corporal
's
amour
terminate
precisely
in
the
way
my
uncle
Toby
describe
it
,
be
not
material
;
it
be
enough
that
it
contain
in
it
the
essence
of
all
the
love
romance
which
ever
have
be
write
since
the
beginning
of
the

<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
corporal
have
finish
the
story
of
his
amour
 
or
rather
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
for
him
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
silently
sally
forth
from
her
arbour
,
replace
the
pin
in
her
mob
,
pass'd
the
wicker
gate
,
and
advance
slowly
towards
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry

box
:
 
the
disposition
which
Trim
have
make
in
my

Toby
's
mind
,
be
too
favourable
a
crisis
to
be
let
slipp'd
      
<EOS>
the

be
determin'd
upon
:
 
it
be

<EOS>
my

order
the

it

it
oppose
every

could
she
have
go
upon

the
manoeuvre
of

in
the

of
the

be
so

of

Mrs.

My

Toby
never
do

and
I
will
answer
for
him
,
that
he
would
have
sit
quietly
upon
a
sofa
from
June
to
January
(
which

you

take

<EOS>
an
eye
be
for
all
the

exactly
like
a
cannon

in
this
respect

that
it
be
not
so
much
the
eye

however

all
I

I
protest

Madam

I

see
nothing

<EOS>
It

the

<EOS>
it

not

madam
a

have
curdle
at

my

Toby
be
make
up

an

full

gentle
salutation

soft
response
 
speak
 
not
like
the

ill

many
an

soft

their

My

appear
from
many
of

be
very
subject
to
this
passion

before
he
marry
 
but
from
a
little
subacid
kind
of
drollish
impatience
in
his
nature
,
whenever
it
befall
him
,
he
would
never
submit
to
it
like
a
christian
;
but
would
pish
,
and
huff
,
and
bounce
,
and
kick
,
and
play
the
Devil
,
and
write
the
bitter
philippick
against

for

have
put
him
by

in
his

transport
of

it

he
begin
thus

add
my

Toby
 
point
to
his
breast
      
<EOS>
She
can
no
more
,
an
'

your

,
stand
a
siege
,
than
she
can
fly
 
cry
the
corporal
      
<EOS>
but
as
we
be
neighbour
,
Trim
,
 
the
good
way
I
think
be
to
let
her
know
it
civilly
first
 
<EOS>
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
now
if
I
may
presume
,
say
the
corporal
,
to
differ
from
your
honour
      
<EOS>
why
else
do
I
talk
to
thee
,
Trim
?
<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
mildly
      
<EOS>
then
I
would
begin
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
with
make
a
good
thundering
attack
upon
her
,
in
return
 
and
tell
her
civilly
afterwards
 
for
if
she
know
any
thing
of
your
honour

in

,
before

L

her

<EOS>
she
know
no
more
at
present
of
it
,
Trim
,
say
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
than
the
child
unborn
    
precious
soul
!
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
have
tell
it
,
with
all
its
circumstance
,
to
Mrs.
Bridget
twenty
-
four
hour
before
;
and
be
at
that
very
moment
sit
in
council
with
her
,
touch
some
slight
misgiving
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
affair
,
which
the
Devil
,
who
never
lie
dead
in
a
ditch
,
have
put
into
her
head
 
before
he
would
allow
half
time
,
to
get
quietly
through
her
Te
Deum
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
terribly
afraid
,
say
widow
Wadman
,
in
case
I
should
marry
him
,
Bridget
 
that
the
poor
captain
will
not
enjoy
his
health
,
with
the
monstrous
wound
upon
his
groin
    
<EOS>
It
may
not
,
Madam
,
be
so
very
large
,
reply
Bridget
,
as
you
think
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
,
<EOS>
besides
,
add
she
 
<EOS>
that
'
tis
dry
up
      
I
could
like
to
know
 
merely
for
his
sake
,
say
Mrs.
Wadman
      
<EOS>
We
will
know
and
long
and
the
broad
of
it
,
in
ten
day
 
answer
Mrs.
Bridget
,
for
whilst
the
captain
be
pay
his
address
to
you
 
<EOS>
I
be
confident
Mr.
Trim
will
be
for
make
love
to
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
let
him
as
much
as
he
will
 
add
<EOS>
Bridget
 
<EOS>
to
get
it
all
out
of
him
    
<EOS>
the
measure
be
take
at
once
 
and
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
go
on
with
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
set
his
left
hand
a
-
kimbo
,
and
give
such
a
flourish
with
his
right
,
as
just
promise
success
 
and
no
more
 
if
your
honour
will
give
me
leave
to
lay
down
the
plan
of
this
attack
      
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
please
me
by
it
,
Trim
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
exceedingly
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
foresee
thou
must
act
in
it
as
my
aid
de
camp
<EOS>
,
here
be
a
crown
,
corporal
,
to
begin
with
,
to
steep
thy
commission
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
say
the
corporal
(
make
a
bow
first
for
his
commission
)
 
we
will
begin
with
get
your
honour
's
lace
clothe
out
of
the
great
campaign
-
trunk
,
to
be
well
air'd
,
and
have
the
blue
and
gold
take
up
at
the
sleeve
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
put
your
white
ramallie
-
wig
fresh
into
pipe
 
and
send
for
a
taylor
,
to
have
your
honour
's
thin
scarlet
breech
turn'd
      
<EOS>
I
have
better
take
the
red
plush
one
,
quoth
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
They
will
be
too
clumsy
 
say
the
corporal
.
      
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
get
a
brush
and
a
little
chalk
to
my
sword
 
<EOS>
'
Twill
be
only
in
your
honour
's
way
,
reply
Trim
.
      
<EOS>
but
your
honour
's
two
razor
shall
be
new
set
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
get
my
Montero
cap
<EOS>
furbish'd
up
,
and
put
on
poor
lieutenant
Le
Fever
's
regimental
coat
,
which
your
honour
give
me
to
wear
for
his
sake
 
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
your
honour
be
clean
shave
 
and
have
get
your
clean
shirt
on
,
with
your
blue
and
gold
,
or
your
fine
scarlet
 
<EOS>
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
t'other
 
and
every
thing
be
ready
for
the
attack
 
<EOS>
we
will
march
up
boldly
,
as
if
'
twa
to
the
face
of
a
bastion
;
and
whilst
your
honour
engage
Mrs.
Wadman
in
the
parlour
,
to
the
right
 
I
will
attack
Mrs.
Bridget
in
the
kitchen
,
to
the
left
;
and
have
seiz'd
the
pass
,
I
will
answer
for
it
,
say
the
corporal
,
snap
his
finger
over
his
head
 
that
the
day
be
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
but
manage
it
right
;
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
I
declare
,
<EOS>
corporal
,
I
have
rather
march
up
to
the
very
edge
of
a
trench
      
a
woman
be
quite
a
different
thing
 
<EOS>
say
the
corporal
.
    
<EOS>
I
suppose
so
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
if
any
thing
in
this
world
,
which
my
father
say
,
could
have
provoke
my
uncle
Toby
,
during
the
time
he
be
in
love
,
it
be
the
perverse
use
my
father
be
always
make
of
an
expression
of
Hilarion
the
hermit
;
who
,
in
speak
of
his
abstinence
,
his
watching
,
flagellation
,
and
other
instrumental
part
of
his
religion
 
would
say
 
tho
'
with
more
facetiousness
than
become
an
hermit
 
"
that
they
be
the
mean
he
use
,
to
make
his
ass
(
mean
his
body
)
leave
off
kick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
please
my
father
well
;
it
be
not
only
a
laconick
way
of
express
  
but
of
libelling
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
desire
and
appetite
of
the
low
part
of
us
;
so
that
for
many
year
of
my
father
's
life
,
'
twas
his
constant
mode
of
expression
 
he
never
use
the
word
passion
once
 
but
ass
always
instead
of
them
 
so
that
he
may
be
say
truly
,
to
have
be
upon
the
bone
,
or
the
back
of
his
own
ass
,
or
else
of
some
other
man
's
,
during
all
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
here
observe
to
you
<EOS>
the
difference
betwixt
My
father
's
ass
and
my
hobby
-
horse
 
in
order
to
keep
character
as
separate
as
may
be
,
in
our
fancy
as
we
go
along
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
hobby
-
horse
,
if
you
recollect
a
little
,
be
no
way
a
vicious
beast
;
he
have
scarce
one
hair
or
lineament
of
the
ass
about
him
 
<EOS>
'
tis
<EOS>
the
sporting
little
filly
-
folly
which
carry
you
out
for
the
present
hour
 
a
maggot
,
a
butterfly
,
a
picture
,
a
fiddlestick
 
<EOS>
an
uncle
Toby
's
siege
 
or
an
any
thing
,
which
a
man
make
a
shift
to
get
a
-
stride
on
,
to
canter
it
away
from
the
care
and
solicitude
of
life
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
as
useful
a
beast
as
be
in
the
whole
creation
 
nor
do
I
really
see
how
the
world
could
do
without
it
      
<EOS>
but
for
my
father
's
ass
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
mount
him
 
<EOS>
mount
him
 
<EOS>
mount
him
 
<EOS>
(
that
be
three
time
,
be
it
not
?
)
 
<EOS>
mount
him
not
:
 
'
tis
a
beast
concupiscent
 
and
foul
befal
<EOS>
the
man
,
who
do
not
hinder
him
from
kick

<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
dear
brother
Toby
,
say
my
father
,
upon
his
first
see
him
after
he
fall
in
love
 
and
how
go
it
with
your
Asse
?
  
<EOS>
now
my
uncle
Toby
think
more
of
the
part
where
he
have
have
the
blister
,
than
of
Hilarion
's
metaphor
 
and
our
preconception
have
(
you
know
)
as
great
a
power
over
the
sound
of
word
as
the
shape
of
thing
,
he
have
imagine
,
that
my
father
,
who
be
not
very
ceremonious
in
his
choice
of
word
,
have
enquire
after
the
part
by
its
proper
name
:
<EOS>
so
notwithstanding
my
mother
,
doctor
Slop
,
and
Mr.
Yorick
,
be
sit
in
the
parlour
,
he
think
it
rather
civil
to
conform
to
the
term
my
father
have
make
use
of
than
not
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
man
be
hemm'd
in
by
two
indecorum
,
and
must
commit
one
of
'em
 
<EOS>
I
always
observe
 
<EOS>
let
him
chuse
which
he
will
,
the
world
will
blame
him
 
so
I
should
not
be
astonish
if
it
blame
my
uncle
Toby
.

well
 
<EOS>
brother
Shandy
 
<EOS>
My
father
have
form
great
expectation
from
his
Asse
in
this
onset
;
and
would
have
bring
him
on
again
;
but
doctor
Slop
set
up
an
intemperate
laugh
 
and
my
mother
cry
out
L
...
bless
us
!
 
<EOS>
it
drive
my
father
's
Asse
off
the
field
 
and
the
laugh
then
become
general
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
bring
him
back
to
the
charge
,
for
some
time
    
<EOS>
and
so
the
discourse
go
on
without
him
.
  
<EOS>
every
body
,
say
my
mother
,
say
you
be
in
love
,
brother
Toby
,
 
and
<EOS>
we
hope
it
be
true
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
as
much
in
love

sister
<EOS>

I
believe
,
reply
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
any
man
usually
be
 
Humph

say
my

<EOS>
and
when
do
you
know
it

quoth
<EOS>
my

<EOS>
when
the

break
;

my

Toby

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
reply
put
my
father
into
good
temper
 
so
he
charg'd
o
'
foot
.
    
<EOS>
as
the
ancient
agree
,
brother
Toby
,
say
my
father
,
that
there
be
two
different
and
distinct
kind
of
love
,
accord
to
the
different
part
which
be
affect
by
it
 
<EOS>
the
Brain
or
Liver
 
<EOS>
I
think
when
a
man
be
in
love
,
it
behove
him
a
little
to
consider
which
of
the
two
he
be
fall
into

<EOS>
what
signify
it
,
brother
Shandy
,
reply
my

Toby

which
of
the
two
it
be

provide
it
will
but
make
a
man
marry
,
and
love
his
wife
,
and
get
a

<EOS>
a

child

<EOS>
cry
my

rise
out
of

look
full
in
my

as
he
force
his
way
betwixt

her

doctor
Slop

a

<EOS>
cry
my

repeat
my

word

he
walk'd
to

my

cry
my

recover
himself
all
at

come
close
up
to
the

not
that
I

I

that
is

whether
I

to

the

and
"
twould
be
cruel
in
me
,
brother
Toby

to
compel
thee
;
say
my

<EOS>
but
'
tis
a

put
to

thee
,
that
it
be
not
thy
beget
a

<EOS>
in

thou
should'st

but
the
system
of
Love

Marriage
thou
goest
upon
,
which
I
would
set
thee
right
in
    
<EOS>
there
be
at
least
,
say
Yorick
,
a
great
deal
of
reason
and
plain
sense
in
captain
Shandy
's
opinion
of
love
;
and
'
tis
amongst
the
ill
-
spend
hour
of
my
life
,
which
I
have
to
answer
for
,
that
I
have
read
so
many
flourish
poet
and
rhetorician
in
my
time
,
from
whom
I
never
could
extract
so
much
    
I
wish
,
Yorick
,
say
my
father
,
you
have
read
Plato
;
for
there
you
would
have
learn
that
there
be
two
love
 
<EOS>
I
know
there
be
two
religion
,
reply
Yorick
,
amongst
the
ancient
 
<EOS>
one
 
for
the
vulgar

and
another
for
the

<EOS>
but
I
think
one
Love
may
have
serve
both
of
them
very
well
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
;
reply
my
father
 
and
for
the

reason
:
 
for
of
these
love

accord
to
Ficinus
's
comment
upon
Velasius
,
the
one
be
rational
      
<EOS>
the
other
be
natural
 
the
first
ancient
 
without

what

My

he

Doctor

though
I

continue

himself
to

the

<EOS>
a

word
to
object

in

Trim
stand

my

and
no

forbid
the

strike
up
this

I
answer
for
it

I

without

avoid

tend

there
be
some

tract

which
if
thou
canst
entice
her

read
over
 
it

suffer
her

the

,
instead
of

itself

for
certainly
key

for

consider
the

interfere

deny
a

the

such
it

would

seem'd

the

look
of
goodness
which
sit

assimilate
every

around
it

Nature

write
Gentleman
with
so
fair

that
even
his
tarnish'd

lace
hat

cockade
of
flimsy

become
him

though
not
worth
a

in
themselves
,
yet
the
moment
my

put
them
on

they
become

seem'd

pick
up

<EOS>
nothing

be
necessary
to

in

fifteen

sixteen
year
since
they
have
be
make

by
a
total
inactivity
in

he
seldom
go
further
than
the
bowling

green
 
<EOS>
his
blue
and
gold
have
become
so
miserably
too
straight
for
him
,
that
it
be
with
the
utmost
difficulty
the
corporal
be
able
to
get
him
into
them
;
the
take
them
up
at
the
sleeve
,
be
of
no
advantage

<EOS>
They
be
lace
however
down
the
back
,
and
at
the
seam
of
the
side
,
&
c.
in
the
mode
of
King
William
's
reign
;
and
to
shorten
all
description
,
they
shine
so
bright
against
the
sun
that
morning
,
and
have
so
metallick
and
doughty
an
air
with
them
,
that
have
my
uncle
Toby
thought
of
attack
in
armour
,
nothing
could
have
so
well
impose
upon
his
imagination

<EOS>
as
for
the

Madam

let
us
govern

<EOS>
It
be

they
be

impracticable
the
night
before

and
as
there
be
no
alternative
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
wardrobe
,
he
sally
forth
in
the
red
plush
.
  
<EOS>
the
corporal
have
array'd
<EOS>
himself
in
poor
Le
Fever
's
regimental
coat
;
and
with
his
hair
tuck'd
<EOS>
up
under
his
Montero

cap
,
which
he
have
furbish'd
up
for
the
occasion
,
march'd
three
pace
distant
from
his
master
:
 
a
whiff
of
military
pride
have
puff'd
out
his
shirt
at
the
wrist
;
and
upon
that
in
a
black
leather
thong
clipp'd
into
a

his

<EOS>
It
look
well
at

;
quoth
my

to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
turn'd
<EOS>
his
head
more
than
once
behind
him
,
to
see
how
he
be
support
by
the
corporal
;
and
the
corporal
as
oft
as
he
do
it
,
give
a
slight
flourish
with
his
stick
 
but
not
vapouringly
;
and
with
the
sweetest
accent
of
most
respectful
encouragement
,
bid
his
honour
"
never
fear

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
my
uncle
Toby
do
fear
;
and
grievously
too
;
he
know
not
(
as
my
father
have
reproach'd
him
)
<EOS>
so
much
as
the
right
end
of
a
woman
from
the
wrong
,
and
therefore
be
never
altogether
at
his
ease
near
any
one
of
them
 
unless
in
sorrow
or
distress
;
then
infinite
be
his
pity
;
nor
would
the
most
courteous
knight
of
romance
have
go
further
,
at

upon
one
leg
,
to
have
wipe
away
a
tear
from
a
woman
's
eye
;
and

except
once
that
he
be
beguile
into
it
by
Mrs.
Wadman
,
he
have
never
look
stedfastly
into

and
would
often
tell
my
father
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
,
that
it
be
almost
(
if
not
about

as
bad
as

it

my

with

Tom

It

he
have
lose
the

of

which
give
sense
and
spirit
to
his

:
 
he
attempt
twice
to

it

himself

so
give
a

<EOS>
to
rally

as
how

with

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
a

gayly
,
 
as

with
what

if

never
burst
  
whether
the

be
not
the

?
"
 
and
so
on
 
take
care
only
as
he
go
along
,
to
season
what
he
have
to
say
upon
sausage
,
rather
under
than
over
;
 
that
he
may
have
room
to
act
in
    
<EOS>
It
be
owe
to
the
neglect
of
that

my

Toby
,
lay
his
hand
upon
Trim

,
that
Count
De

which
if
he

Lisle
have
not
fall
into

nor
Ghent

Bruges

which

it

continue
my

that

our

my

Religion
incline
him
to

one
thing

his

a

exactly

my

nothing

finish
his

that

down

cut
the
string
into

and
hold
them
in
his

,
whilst
she
take
them
out
one

then
,
by
put
them
across
her

that
she
may
take
them
out
as
she
want
them
 
<EOS>
and
so
on
from
little
to
more
<EOS>
,
till
at
last
he
adventure
to
tie
the

whilst

<EOS>
now
a

chuse
a

so
the

She

from

the

My

from
thence
to
the
end
of
my

Toby

panegyrick
upon

in

follow
it

when
see

that
instead
of

up

they
both
face
about
and
march'd
down
the

diametrically

he
break
out
at

with
that
little
subacid
soreness

which
,
in

distinguish
his
character
from

I

<EOS>
my

I
wish
,
say
my

raise
his

the

They

<EOS>
say
my

<EOS>
now
she
have
a
way

which

by

I
would
this

give
away
my
purple
jerkin
,
and
my
yellow
slipper
into
the
bargain
,
if
some
of
your
reverence
would
imitate
 
and
that
be
,
never
to
refuse
her
assent
and
consent
to
any
proposition
my
father
lay
before
her

she
do

upon
which
the
tenet

proposition
roll

She
content
herself
with
do
all
that
her
godfather

godmother
promise
for
her
 
<EOS>

no
more
;
and
so
would
go
on
use
a
hard
word
twenty

together

reply
to
it
too

if
it
be
a

in

its

without
give
herself
any
trouble
to
enquire
about
it

<EOS>
this
be
an
eternal
source
of
misery
to
my
father
,
and
break
the
neck
,
at
the
first
setting
out

of
more
good
dialogue
between
them

than
could
have
do
the

the
few
which
survive

difference
 
say
my
mother
      
<EOS>
in
a
fool
's
head
,
reply
my
father
    
unless
she
should
happen
to
have
a
child
 
<EOS>
say
my
mother
      
<EOS>
but
she
must
persuade
my
brother
Toby
first
to
get
her
one
    
to
be
sure
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
quoth
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
Though
if
it
come
to
persuasion
 
say
my
father
 
Lord
have
mercy
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
amen
:
 
say
my
mother
,
piano
.
  
<EOS>
amen
:
 
cry
my
father
,
fortissime
.
  
<EOS>
amen
:
 
say
my
mother
again
 
but
with
such
a
sighing
cadence
of
personal
pity
at
the
end
of
it
,
as
discomfited
every
fibre
about
my
father
 
<EOS>
he
instantly
take
out
his
almanack
;
but
before
he
could
untie
it
,
Yorick
's
congregation
come
out
of
church
,
become
a
full
answer
to
one
half
of
his
business
with
it
 
and
my
mother
tell
him
it
be
a
sacrament
day
 
<EOS>
leave
him
as
little
in
doubt
,
as
to
the
other
part
 
He
put
his
almanack
into
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
Lord
of
the
Treasury
thinking
of
way
and
mean
,
could
not
have
return
home
with
a
more
embarrassed
look
.
    
<EOS>
upon
look
back
from
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
,
and
survey
the
texture
of
what
have
be
write
,
it
be
necessary
,
that
upon
this
page
and
the
three
following
,
a
good
quantity
of
heterogeneous
matter
be
insert
to
keep
up
that
just
balance
betwixt
wisdom
and
folly
,
without
which
a
book
would
not
hold
together
a
single
year
:
nor
be
it
a
poor
creeping
digression
(
<EOS>
which
but
for
the
name
of
,
a
man
may
continue
as
well
go
on
in
the
king
's
highway
)
<EOS>
which
will
do
the
business
 
<EOS>
no
;
if
it
be
to
be
a
digression
,
it
must
be
a
good
frisky
one
,
and
upon
a
frisky
subject
too
,
where
neither
the
horse
or
his
rider
be
to
be
catch
,
but
by
rebound
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
difficulty
,
be
raise
power
suitable
to
the
nature
of
the
service
:
 
<EOS>
Fancy
be
capricious
 
Wit
must
not
be
search
for
 
and
Pleasantry
(
good
-
natured
slut
as
she
be
)
will
not
come
in
at
a
call
,
be
an
empire
to
be
lay
at
her
foot
.
    
<EOS>
the
good
way
for
a
man
,
be
to
say
his
prayer
    
only
if
it
put
him
in
mind
of
his
infirmity
and
defect
as
well
ghostly
as
bodily
 
for
that
purpose
,
he
will
find
himself
rather
bad
after
he
have
say
them
than
before
 
for
other
purpose
,
better
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
there
be
not
a
way
either
moral
or
mechanical
under
heaven
that
I
could
think
of
,
which
I
have
not
take
with
myself
in
this
case
:
 
sometimes
by
address
myself
directly
to
the
soul
herself
,
and
argue
the
point
over
and
over
again
with
her
upon
the
extent
of
her
own
faculty
      
<EOS>
I
never
could
make
them
an
inch
the
wide
    
then
by
change
my
system
,
and
try
what
could
be
make
of
it
upon
the
body
,
by
temperance
,
soberness
,
and
chastity
:
 
<EOS>
these
be
good
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
in
themselves
 
they
be
good
,
absolutely
;
 
they
be
good
,
relatively
;
 
they
be
good
for
health
 
<EOS>
they
be
good
for
happiness
in
this
world
 
<EOS>
they
be
good
for
happiness
in
the
next
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
they
be
good
for
every
thing
<EOS>
but
the
thing
want
;
and
there
they
be
good
for
nothing
,
but
to
leave
the
soul
just
as
heaven
make
it
:
 
as
for
the
theological
virtue
of
faith
and
hope
,
they
give
it
courage
;
but
then
that
snivel
virtue
of
Meekness
(
as
my
father
would
always
call
it
)
take
it
quite
away
again
,
so
you
be
exactly
where
you
start
.
  
<EOS>
now
in
all
common
and
ordinary
case
,
there
be
nothing
which
I
have
find
to
answer
so
well
as
this
      
<EOS>
certainly
,
if
there
be
any
dependence
upon
Logic
,
and
that
I
be
not
blind
by
self
-
love
,
there
must
be
something
of
true
genius
about
me
,
merely
upon
this
symptom
of
it
,
that
I
do
not
know
what
envy
be
:
 
for
never
do
I
hit
upon
any
invention
or
device
<EOS>
which
tendeth
to
the
furtherance
of
good
writing
,
<EOS>
but
I
instantly
make
it
public
;
willing
that
all
mankind
should
write
as
well
as
myself
.
    
<EOS>
which
they
certainly
will
,
when
they
think
as
little
.
    
<EOS>
now
in
ordinary
case
,
that
is
,
when
I
be
only
stupid
,
and
the
thought
rise
heavily
and
pass
gummous
through
my
pen
    
or
that
I
be
get
,
I
know
not
how
,
into
a
cold
unmetaphorical
vein
of
infamous
writing
,
and
can
not
take
a
plumb
-
lift
out
of
it
for
my
soul
;
so
must
be
oblige
to
go
on
writing
like
a
dutch
commentator
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
,
unless
something
be
do
      
I
never
stand
confer
with
pen
and
ink
one
moment
;
for
if
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
or
a
stride
or
two
across
the
room
will
not
do
the
business
for
me
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
razor
at
once
;
and
have
try
the
edge
of
it
upon
the
palm
of
my
hand
,
without
further
ceremony
,
except
that
of
first
lather
my
beard
,
I
shave
it
off
;
take
care
only
if
I
do
leave
a
hair
,
that
it
be
not
a
grey
one
:
 
<EOS>
this
do
<EOS>
,
I
change
my
shirt
 
<EOS>
put
on
a
well
coat
 
<EOS>
send
for
my
last
wig
 
put
my
topaz
ring
upon
my
finger
;
and
in
a
word
,
dress
myself
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
me
,
after
my
good
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
devil
in
hell
must
be
in
it
,
if
this
do
not
do
:
 
for
consider
,
Sir
,
as
every
man
chuse
to
be
present
at
the
shaving
of
his
own
beard
<EOS>
(
though
there
be
no
rule
without
an
exception
)
,
and
unavoidably
sit
over-
against
himself
the
whole
time
it
be
do
,
<EOS>
in
case
he
have
a
hand
in
it
  
<EOS>
the
situation
,
like
all
other
,
have
notion
of
her
own
to
put
into
the
brain
.
      
<EOS>
I
maintain
it
,
the
conceit
of
a
rough
-
bearded
man
,
be
seven
year
more
terse
and
juvenile
for
one
single
operation
;
and
if
they
do
not
run
a
risk
of
be
quite
shave
away
,
may
be
carry
up
by
continual
shaving
,
to
the
high
pitch
of
sublimity
 
<EOS>
how
Homer
could
write
with
so
long
a
beard
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
and
as
it
make
against
my
hypothesis
,
<EOS>
I
as
little
care
 
<EOS>
but
let
us
return
to
the
Toilet
.
  
<EOS>
Ludovicus
Sorbonensis
make
this
entirely
an
affair
of
the
body
(
Greek
)
as
he
call
it
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
deceive
:
 
<EOS>
the
soul
and
body
be
joint
-
sharer
in
every
thing
they
get
:
 
<EOS>
a
man
can
not
dress
,
but
his
idea
get
cloth'd
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
;
and
if
he
dress
like
a
gentleman
,
every
one
of
them
stand
presented
to
his
imagination
,
genteelize
along
with
him
 
so
that
he
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
take
his
pen
,
and
write
like
himself
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
cause
,
when
your
honour
and
reverence
would
know
whether
I
writ
clean
and
fit
to
be
read
,
you
will
be
able
to
judge
full
as
well
by
look
into
my
Laundress
's
bill
,
as
my
book
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
single
month
in
which
I
can
make
it
appear
,
that
I
dirty
one
and
thirty
shirt
with
clean
writing
;
and
after
all
,
be
more
abus'd
,
curse
,
criticis'd
,
and
confound
,
and
have
more
mystic
head
shake
at
me
,
for
what
I
have
write
in
that
one
month
,
than
in
all
the
other
month
of
that
year
put
together
.
    
<EOS>
but
their
honour
and
reverence
have
not
see
my
bill
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
never
have
any
intention
of
begin
the
digression
,
I
be
make
all
this
preparation
for
,
till
I
come
to
the
74th
chapter
 
<EOS>
I
have
this
chapter
to
put
to
whatever
use
<EOS>
I
think
proper
 
<EOS>
I
have
twenty
this
moment
ready
for
it
 
<EOS>
I
could
write
my
chapter
of
Button
-
hole
in
it
    
<EOS>
or
my
chapter
of
pishe
,
which
should
follow
them
    
<EOS>
or
my
chapter
of
Knots
,
in
case
their
reverence
have
do
with
them
 
they
may
lead
me
into
mischief
:
 
<EOS>
the
safe
way
be
to
follow
the
track
of
the
learn
,
and
raise
objection
against
what
I
have
be
write
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
declare
before
-
hand
,
I
know
no
more
than
my
heel
how
to
answer
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
first
,
it
may
be
say
,
there
be
a
pelting
kind
of
thersitical
satire
,
as
black
as
the
very
ink
'
tis
write
with
 
(
and
by
the
bye
,
whoever
say
so
,
be
indebted
to
the
muster
-
master
general
of
the
grecian
army
,
for
suffer
the
name
of
so
ugly
and
foul
-
mouth'd
<EOS>
a
man
as
thersite
to
continue
upon
his
roll
 
for
it
have
furnish'd
him
with
an
epithet
)
 
in
these
production
he
will
urge
,
all
the
personal
washing
and
scrubbing
upon
earth
do
a
sink
genius
no
sort
of
good
 
but
just
the
contrary
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
the
dirtier
the
fellow
be
,
the
well
generally
he
succeed
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
,
I
have
no
other
answer
 
<EOS>
at
least
ready
 
but
<EOS>
that
the
Archbishop
of
Benevento
write
his
nasty
romance
of
the
Galatea
,
as
all
the
world
know
,
in
a
purple
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
purple
pair
of
breech
;
and
that
the
penance
set
him
of
write
a
commentary
upon
the
book
of
the
Revelations
,
as
severe
as
it
be
look'd
upon
by
one
part
of
the
world
,
be
far
from
be
deem'd
<EOS>
so
,
by
the
other
,
upon
the
single
account
of
that
investment
.
  
<EOS>
another
objection
,
to
all
this
remedy
,
be
its
want
of
universality
;
forasmuch
as
the
shaving
part
of
it
,
upon
which
so
much
stress
be
lay
,
by
an
unalterable
law
of
nature
<EOS>
exclude
one
half
of
the
specie
entirely
from
its
use
:
 
<EOS>
all
I
can
say
be
,
that
female
writer
,
whether
of
England
,
or
of
France
,
must
e'en
go
without
it
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
spanish
lady
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
sort
of
distress
      
<EOS>
the
seventy
-
fourth
chapter
be
come
at
last
;
and
bring
nothing
with
it
but
a
sad
signature
of
"
how
our
pleasure
slip
from
under
us
in
this
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
for
in
talking
of
my
digression
 
<EOS>
I
declare
before
heaven
<EOS>
I
have
make
it
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
strange
creature
be
mortal
man
!
<EOS>
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
very
true
<EOS>
,
say
I
 
<EOS>
but
'
twere
well
to
get
all
these
thing
out
of
our
head
,
and
return
to
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
when
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
have
march
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
avenue
,
they
recollect
their
business
lie
the
other
way
;
so
they
face
about
and
march
up
straight
to
Mrs.
Wadman
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
warrant
your
honour
;
say
the
corporal
,
touch
his
Montero
-
cap
with
his
hand
,
as
he
pass
him
in
order
to
give
a
knock
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
contrary
to
his
invariable
way
of
treat
his
faithful
servant
,
say
nothing
good
or
bad
:
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
he
have
not
altogether
marshal'd
<EOS>
his
idea
;
he
wish'd
for
another
conference
,
and
as
the
corporal
be
mount
up
the
three
step
before
the
door
 
<EOS>
he
hem'd
twice
 
a
portion
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
most
modest
spirit
flee
,
at
each
expulsion
,
towards
the
corporal
;
he
stand
with
the
rapper
of
the
door
suspend
for
a
full
minute
in
his
hand

he
scarce
know
why

<EOS>
Bridget
stand
perdue
within

with
her
finger
and
her
thumb
upon
the
latch

benumb'd
with
expectation

and
Mrs.
Wadman

with
an
eye
ready
to
be
deflower
again
,
sit
breathless
behind
the
window-
curtain
of
her
bed

chamber

watch
their
approach

<EOS>
Trim

<EOS>
say
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
articulate
the
word
,
the
minute
expire
,
and
Trim
let
fall
the
rapper
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
perceiving
that
all
hope
of
a
conference
be
knock'd
on
the
head
by
it
 
<EOS>
whistle
Lillabullero

<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Bridget

the

do
not
knock
as
often
as
perchance
your
honour

taylor
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
take
my
example
something
near
home
;
for
I
owe
mine
,
some
five
and
twenty
pound
at
least
,
and
wonder
at
the
man
's
patience
      
<EOS>
but
this
be
nothing
at
all
to
the
world
:
 
only
'
tis
a
curse
thing
to
be
in
debt
;
and
there
seem
to
be
a
fatality
in
the
exchequer
of
some
poor
prince
,
particularly
those
of
our
house
,
which
no
economy
can
bind
down
in
iron
:
 
for
my
own
part

I
be
persuade
there
be
not
any
one
prince
,
prelate
,
pope
,
or
potentate
,
great
or
small
upon
earth
,
more
desirous
in
his
heart
of
keep
straight
with
the
world
than
I
be
 
or
who
take
more
likely
mean
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
give
above
half
a
guinea
 
or
walk
with
boot
 
or
cheapen
tooth
-
pick
 
or
lie
out
a
shilling
upon

box
the
year
round

and
for
the
six
month
I
be
in
the
country
<EOS>
,
I
be
upon
so
small
a
scale
,
that
with
all
the
good
temper
in
the
world

I
outdo
Rousseau

a

for
I
keep
neither

Mrs.

pale

<EOS>
blush'd
bad

which

for

I

I

<EOS>
whilst
all
this
be
run
through
Mrs.

imagination

my

Toby
have
rise
from
the
sopha

and
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
parlour
door
,
to
give
Trim
an
order
about
it
in
the
passage

<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
in
the
garret
,
say
my

Toby
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
there
,
an

this
morning

answer
Trim
 
<EOS>

prithee

step
directly
for
it

Trim

say
my

Toby

and
bring
it
into
the
parlour

the
corporal
do
not
approve
of
the
order

most
cheerfully
obey
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
be
not
an
act
of
his

<EOS>
the

be
;
so
he
put
on
his
Montero

and
go
as
fast
as
his
lame
knee
would
let
him

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
return
into
the
parlour
,
and
sit
himself
down
again
upon
the
sopha

You
shall
lay
your

upon
the
place
 
<EOS>

my

I

not

quoth
Mrs.

to
herself

this
require
a
second
translation

<EOS>
it

what
little
knowledge

get
by
mere
word
 
we
must
go
up

the
first

<EOS>
now
in
order
to
clear
up
the
mist
which
hang
upon
these

I
must
endeavour
to
be

clear

myself

God
bless
you
    
<EOS>
now
give
me
all
the
help
you
can

<EOS>
as
there
be
fifty
different
end
(
count
all
end
in
 
as
well
civil
as
religious
)
for
which
a
woman
take
a
husband

<EOS>
the
first
set
about

carefully
weighs
,
then
separate
and
distinguishe
in
her
mind

which
of
all
that
number
of
end
be
hers
;
then
by
discourse
,
enquiry
,
argumentation

inference
,
she
investigate
and
find
out
whether
she
have
get
hold
of
the
right
one
 
<EOS>
and
if
she
have
 
then
,
by
pull
it
gently
this
way
and
that
way
,
she
further
form
a
judgment
,
whether
it
will
not
break
in
the
drawing

<EOS>
the
imagery
under
which
Slawkenbergius
impress
this
upon
the
reader
's
fancy
,
in
the
beginning
of
his
third
Decad
,
be
so
ludicrous
,
that
the
honour
I
bear
the
sex
,
will
not
suffer
me
to
quote
it
 
<EOS>
otherwise
it
be
not
destitute

"
She
first

saith
Slawkenbergius
,
stop
the
asse

and
hold
his
halter
in
her
left
hand
(
lest
he
should
get
away
)
<EOS>
she
thrust
her
right
hand
into
the
very
bottom
of
his
pannier
to
search
for
it
 
for
what

<EOS>
you
will
not

the
sooner

quoth
Slawkenbergius
,
for
interrupt
me
    
<EOS>
"
I

empty

I

<EOS>
and
thou
art
little
better

quoth
she
to
the
third

for
nothing
be
there
in
thy
pannier
but
trunk
-
hose
and
pantofle
 
and
so
to
the
fourth
and
fifth

go
on
one
by
one
through
the
whole
string
,
till
come
to
the
asse

carry

she
turn
the

upside

it
 
stretch

of
it

<EOS>
of
what
?
<EOS>
for
the
love
of
Christ

<EOS>
I
be
determine
,
answer
Slawkenbergius
,
that
all
the
power
upon
earth
shall
never
wring
that
secret
from
my
breast

<EOS>
We
live
in
a
world
beset
on
all
side
with
mystery
and
riddle
 
<EOS>
and
so
'
tis
<EOS>
no
matter
 
else
it
seem
strange
,
that
Nature
,
who
make
every
thing
so
well
to
answer
its
destination
,
and
seldom
or
never
err
,
unless
for
pastime
,
in
give
such
form
and
aptitude
to
whatever
pass
through
her
hand

that
whether

the
plough

the
caravan
,
the
cart
 
or
whatever
other
creature
<EOS>
she
model
,
be
it
but
an
asse
's
foal
,
you
be
sure
to
have
the
thing
you
want
;
and
yet
at
the
same
time
should
so
eternally
bungle
it
as
she
do
,
in
make
so
simple
a
thing
as
a
married
man
.
  
<EOS>
whether
it
be
in
the
choice
of
the
clay
 
or
that
it
be
frequently
spoil
in
the
baking
;
by
an
excess
of
which
a
husband
may
turn
out
too
crusty
(
you
know
)
on
one
hand
 
or
not
enough
<EOS>
so
,
through
defect
of
heat
,
on
the
other
  
or
whether
this
great
Artificer
be
not
so
attentive
to
the
little
platonic
exigence
of
that
part
of
the
specie
,
for
whose
use
she
be
fabricate
this
 
or
that
her
Ladyship
sometimes
scarce
know
what
sort
of
a
husband
will
do
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
:
 
we
will
discourse
about
it
after
supper
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
enough
,
that
neither
the
observation
itself
,
or
the
reasoning
upon
it
,
be
at
all
to
the
purpose
 
but
rather
against
it

since
with
regard
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
fitness
for
the
marriage
state
,
nothing
be
ever
well
:
she
have
form
him
of
the
good

kindly
clay
 
have
temper'd
<EOS>
it
with
her
own
milk
,
and
breathe
into
it
the
sweetest
spirit
 
<EOS>
she
have
make
him
all
gentle
,
generous

and
humane
 
she
have
fill
his
heart
with
trust
and
confidence
,
and
dispose
every
passage
which
lead
to
it
,
for
the
communication
of
the
tender
office
 
<EOS>
she
have
moreover
consider
the
other
cause
for
which
matrimony
be

and
accordingly
.

<EOS>
the
donation

my

Toby

<EOS>
now
this

be
somewhat
apocryphal
;
and
the
Devil
,
who
be
the
great
disturber
of
our
faith
in
this
world
,
have
raise
scruple
in
Mrs.

brain
about
it

like
a

Mrs.

upon
one
of

most
concessible
postulata

,
that
whilst
my

love
to
her
mistress
,
the
corporal
could
find
nothing
well
to
do
,
than
make
love
to
her
 
"
<EOS>
and
I
will
let
him
as
much
as
he

say
Bridget

to
get
it
out

him

depend
upon
my

as
the
Devil

Mrs.
Wadman
have
but
one

and
as
it
possibly
may
be
her
last
(
without
discourage
Mrs.

discredit
her
talent

be
determine
to
play
her
card
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
want
not

<EOS>
a
child
may
have
look'd
<EOS>
into
his
hand
  
there
be
such
a
plainness
and
simplicity
in
his
playing
out
<EOS>
what
trump
he
have
 
with
such
an
unmistrusting
ignorance
of
the
ten

ace
 
and
so
naked
and
defenceless
<EOS>
do
he
sit
upon
the

sopha
with
widow

that
a
generous
heart
would
have
weep
to
have
win
the
game
of
him

<EOS>
let
us
drop
the
metaphor
.
      
<EOS>
and
the
story
<EOS>
too
 
if
you
please
:
 
<EOS>
for
though
I
have
all
along
be
hasten
towards
this
part
of
it

with
so
much
earnest
desire
,
as
well
know
it
to
be
the
choice
morsel
of
what
I
have
to
offer
to
the
world
,
yet
now
that
I
be
get
to
it
,
any
one
be
welcome
to
take
my
pen
,
and
go
on
with
the
story
for
me
that
will
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
difficulty
of
the
description
I
be
go
to
give
 
and
feel
my
want
of
power

<EOS>
It
be
one
comfort
at

to
me
,
that
I
lose
some
fourscore
ounce
of
blood
this
week
in
a
most
uncritical
fever
which
attack
me
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
;
so
that
I
have
still
<EOS>
some
hope
remain
,
it
may
be
more
in
the
serous
or
globular
part
of
the
blood
,
than
in
the
subtile
aura
of
the
brain
 
<EOS>
be
it
which
it
will
 
<EOS>
an
invocation
can
do
no
hurt
 
<EOS>
and
I
leave
the
affair
entirely
to
the
invoke

to
inspire

a
look
so
perfectly
in
tune
to
a
feel
heart
,
that
I
instantly
make
a
vow
,
I
would
give
him
a
four
-
and
-
twenty
sous
piece
,
when
I
get
to
Moulins
      
<EOS>
and
who
be
poor
Maria
?
<EOS>
say
I.
  
<EOS>
the
love
and
piety
of
all
the
village
around
us
;
say
the
postillion
 
<EOS>
it
be
but
three
year
ago
,
that
the
sun
do
not
shine
upon
so
fair
,
so
quick-
witte
and
amiable
a
maid
;
and
well
fate
<EOS>
do
Maria
deserve
,
than
to
have
her
Banns
forbid
,
by
the
intrigue
of
the
curate
of
the
parish
who
publish
them
    
<EOS>
He
be
go
on
,
when
Maria
,
who
have
make
a
short
pause
,
put
the
pipe
to
her
mouth
,
and
begin
the
air
again
 
<EOS>
they
be
the
same
note
;
 
yet
be
ten
time
sweet
:
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
evening
service
to
the
Virgin
,
say
the
young
man
 
<EOS>
but
who
have
teach
her
to
play
it
 
or
how
she
come
by
her
pipe
<EOS>
,
no
one
know
;
we
think
that
heaven
have
assist
her
in
both
;
for
ever
since
she
have
be
unsettle
in
her
mind
,
it
seem
her
only
consolation
 
<EOS>
she
have
never
once
have
the
pipe
out
of
her
hand
,
but
play
that
service
upon
it
almost
night
and
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
postillion
deliver
this
with
so
much
discretion
and
natural
eloquence
,
that
I
could
not
help
decyphere
something
in
his
face
above
his
condition
,
and
should
have
sift
out
his
history
,
have
not
poor
Maria
take
such
full
possession
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
get
up
by
this
time
almost
to
the
bank
where
Maria
be
sit
:
she
be
in
a
thin
white
jacket
,
with
her
hair
,
all
but
two
tress
,
draw
up
into
a
silk
-
net
,
<EOS>
with
a
few
olive
leave
twist
a
little
fantastically
on
one
side
 
she
be
beautiful
;
and
if
ever
I
feel
the
full
force
of
an
honest
heart
-
ache
,
it
be
the
moment
I
see
her
      
<EOS>
God
help
her
!
<EOS>
poor
damsel
!
<EOS>
above
a
hundred
masse
,
say
the
postillion
,
have
be
say
in
the
several
parish
church
and
convent
around
,
for
her
,
 
but
without
effect
;
we
have
still
hope
,
as
she
be
sensible
for
short
interval
,
that
the
Virgin
at
last
will
restore
her
to
herself
;
but
her
parent
,
who
know
her
good
,
be
hopeless
upon
that
score
,
and
think
her
sense
be
lose
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
postillion
speak
this
,
Maria
make
a
cadence
so
melancholy
,
so
tender
and
querulous
,
that
I
spring
out
of
the
chaise
to
help
her
,
and
find
myself
sit
betwixt
her
and
her
goat
before
I
relapse
from
my
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
Maria
look'd
<EOS>
wistfully
for
some
time
at
me
,
and
then
at
her
goat
 
<EOS>
and
then
at
me
 
<EOS>
and
then
at
her
goat
again
,
<EOS>
and
so
on
,
alternately
      
well
,
Maria
,
say
I
softly
 
<EOS>
what
resemblance
do
you
find
?
  
<EOS>
I
do
entreat
the
candid
reader
to
believe
me
,
that
it
be
from
the
humble
conviction
of
what
a
Beast
man
be
,
 
that
I
ask
the
question
;
and
that
I
would
not
have
let
fall
an
unseasonable
pleasantry
in
the
venerable
presence
of
Misery
,
to
be
entitle
to
all
the
wit
that
ever
<EOS>
Rabelais
scatter'd
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
own
my
heart
<EOS>
smote
me
,
and
that
I
so
smart
at
the
very
idea
of
it
,
that
I
swear
I
would
set
up
for
wisdom
,
and
utter
grave
sentence
the
rest
of
my
day
 
and
never
 
never
attempt
again
to
commit
mirth
with
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
the
long
day
I
have
to
live
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
write
nonsense
to
them
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
a
reserve
 
but
that
I
leave
to
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Adieu
,
Maria
!
 
<EOS>
adieu
,
poor
hapless
damsel
!
 
<EOS>
some
time
,
but
not
now
,
I
may
hear
thy
sorrow
from
thy
own
lip
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
deceive
;
for
that
moment
she
take
her
pipe
and
tell
me
such
a
tale
of
woe
with
it
,
that
I
rise
up
,
and
with
broken
and
irregular
step
<EOS>
walk'd
<EOS>
softly
to
my
chaise
.
    
<EOS>
what
an
excellent
inn
at
Moulins
!
    
<EOS>
when
we
have
get
to
the
end
of
this
chapter
(
but
not
before
)
we
must
all
turn
back
to
the
two
blank
chapter
,
on
the
account
of
which
my
honour
have
lain
bleed
<EOS>
this
half
hour
 
<EOS>
I
stop
it
,
by
pull
off
one
of
my
yellow
slipper
and
throw
it
with
all
my
violence
to
the
opposite
side
of
my
room
,
with
a
declaration
at
the
heel
of
it
      
<EOS>
that
whatever
resemblance
it
may
bear
to
half
the
chapter
which
be
write
in
the
world
,
or
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
may
be
now
write
in
it
 
that
it
be
as
casual
as
the
foam
of
Zeuxis
his
horse
;
besides
,
I
look
upon
a
chapter
which
have
only
nothing
in
it
,
with
respect
;
and
consider
what
bad
thing
there
be
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
no
way
a
proper
subject
for
satire
      
<EOS>
why
then
be
it
leave
so
?
 
<EOS>
and
here
without
stay
for
my
reply

<EOS>
and
I
will
let
them
do
it
,
as
Bridget
say
,
as
much
as
they
please
;
for
how
be
it
possible
they
should
foresee
the
necessity
I

write
the
84th
chapter
of
my
book

77th

so
I
do
not

it
<EOS>
amiss
 
<EOS>
all
I
wish
be
,
that
it
may
be
a
lesson

<EOS>
the
Seventy
-
seventh
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Bridget
open
the
door
before
the
corporal
have
well
give
the
rap
,
the
interval
betwixt
that
and
my
uncle
Toby
's
introduction
into
the
parlour
,
be
so
short
,
that
Mrs.
Wadman
have
but
just
time
to
get
from
behind
the
curtain
 
<EOS>
lie
a
Bible
upon
the
table
,
and
advance
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
to
receive
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
salute
Mrs.
Wadman
,
after
the
manner
in
which
woman
be
salute
by
man
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
God
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
 
then
face
about
,
he
march'd
up
abreast
with
her
to
the
sopha
,
and
in
three
plain
word
 
though
not
before
he
be
sit
down
 
nor
after
he
be
sit
down
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
be
sit
down
,
tell
her
,
"
he
be
in
love
"
 
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
strain
himself
more
in
the
declaration
than
he
need
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
naturally
look
down
,
upon
a
slit
she
have
be
darn
up
in
her
apron
,
in
expectation
every
moment
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
would
go
on
;
but
have
no
talent
for
amplification
,
and
Love
moreover
of
all
other
be
a
subject
of
which
<EOS>
he
be
the
least
a
master
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
tell
Mrs.
Wadman
once
that
he
love
her
,
he
let
it
alone
,
and
leave
the
matter
to
work
after
its
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
always
in
rapture
with
this
system
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
as
he
falsely
call
it
,
and
would
often
say
,
that
could
his
brother
Toby
to
his
processe
have
add
but
a
pipe
of
tobacco
 
he
have
wherewithal
to
have
find
his
way
,
if
there
be
faith
in
a
spanish
proverb
,
towards
the
heart
of
half
the
woman
upon
the
globe
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
never
understand
what
my
father
mean
;
nor
will
I
presume
to
extract
more
from
it
,
than
a
condemnation
of
an
error
which
the
bulk
of
the
world
lie
under
 
but
the
French
,
every
one
of
'em
to
a
man
,
who
believe
in
it
,
almost
as
much
as
the
Real
Presence
,
"
that
talk
of
love
,
be
make
it
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
set
about
make
a
black
-
pudding
by
the
same
receipt
.
  
<EOS>
let
us
go
on
:
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
sit
in
expectation
my
uncle
Toby
would
do
so
,
to
almost
the
first
pulsation
of
that
minute
,
wherein
silence
on
one
side
or
the
other
,
generally
become
indecent
:
 
<EOS>
so
edge
herself
a
little
more
towards
him
,
and
raise
up
her
eye
,
sub
blushing
,
as
she
do
it
 
<EOS>
she
take
up
the
gauntlet
 
or
the
discourse
<EOS>
(
if
you
like
it
better
)
and
commune
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
thus
:
  
the
care
and
disquietude
of
the
marriage
state
,
quoth
Mrs.
Wadman
,
be
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
so
 
say
my
uncle
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
when
a
person
,
continue
Mrs.
Wadman
,
be
so
much
at
his
ease
as
you
be
 
so
happy
,
captain
Shandy
,
in
yourself
,
your
friend
and
your
amusement
 
I
wonder
,
what
reason
can
incline
you
to
the
state
      
<EOS>
They
be
write
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
the
Common
-
Prayer
Book
.
  
<EOS>
thus
far
my
uncle
Toby
go
on
warily
,
and
keep
within
his
depth
,
leave
Mrs.
Wadman
to
sail
upon
the
gulph
as
she
please
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
child
 
say
Mrs.
Wadman
 
though
a
principal
end
perhaps
of
the
institution
,
and
the
natural
wish
,
I
suppose
,
of
every
parent
 
yet
do
not
we
all
find
,
they
be
certain
sorrow
,
and
very
uncertain
comfort
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
there
,
dear
sir
,
to
pay
one
for
the
heart
-
achs
 
what
compensation
for
the
many
tender
and
disquieting
apprehension
of
a
suffering
and
defenceless
mother
who
bring
them
into
life
?
 
<EOS>
I
declare
,
say
my
uncle
Toby
,
smit
with
pity
,
I
know
of
none
;
unless
it
be
the
pleasure
which
it
have
please
God
    
<EOS>
a
fiddlestick
!
<EOS>
quoth
she
.
   
<EOS>
the
Seventy
-
eighth
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
be
such
an
infinitude
of
note
,
tune
,
cant
,
chant
,
air
,
look
,
and
accent
with
which
the
word
fiddlestick
may
be
pronounce
in
all
such
cause
as
this
,
every
one
of
'em
impress
a
sense
and
meaning
as
different
from
the
other
,
as
dirt
from
cleanliness
 
that
casuist
(
for
it
be
an
affair
of
conscience
on
that
score
)
<EOS>
reckon
up
no
less
than
fourteen
thousand
in
which
you
may
do
either
right
or
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
hit
upon
the
fiddlestick
,
which
summon
up
all
my
uncle
Toby
's
modest
blood
into
his
cheek
 
so
feel
within
himself
<EOS>
that
he
have
somehow
or
other
get
beyond
his
depth
,
he
stopt
short
;
and
without
enter
further
either
into
the
pain
or
pleasure
of
matrimony
,
he
lay
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
make
an
offer
to
take
them
as
they
be
,
and
share
them
along
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
my
uncle
Toby
have
say
this
,
he
do
not
care
to
say
it
again
;
so
cast
his
eye
upon
the
Bible
which
Mrs.
Wadman
have
lay
upon
the
table
,
he
take
it
up
;
and
pop
,
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
upon
a
passage
in
it
,
of
all
other
the
most
interesting
to
him
 
which
be
the
siege
of
Jericho
 
<EOS>
he
set
himself
to
read
it
over
 
leave
his
proposal
of
marriage
,
as
he
have
do
his
declaration
of
love
,
to
work
with
her
after
its
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
work
neither
as
an
astringent
or
a
loosener
;
nor
like
opium
,
or
bark
,
or
mercury
,
or
buckthorn
,
or
any
one
drug
which
nature
have
bestow
upon
the
world
 
in
short
,
it
work'd
not
at
all
in
her
;
and
the
cause
of
that
be
,
that
there
be
something
work
there
before
 
Babbler
that
I
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
anticipate
what
it
be
a
dozen
time
;
but
there
be
fire
still
in
the
subject
 
allon
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
natural
for
a
perfect
stranger
who
be
go
from
London
to
Edinburgh
,
to
enquire
before
he
set
out
,
<EOS>
how
many
mile
to
York
;
which
be
about
the
half
way
 
nor
do
any
body
wonder
,
if
he
go
on
and
ask
about
the
corporation
,
&
c.
.
<EOS>
..
  
<EOS>
It
be
just
as
natural
for
Mrs.
Wadman
,
whose
first
husband
be
all
his
time
afflict
with
a
Sciatica
,
to
wish
to
know
how
far
from
the
hip
to
the
groin
;
and
how
far
she
be
likely
to
suffer
more
or
less
in
her
feeling
,
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
accordingly
read
Drake
's
anatomy
from
one
end
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
peep
into
Wharton
upon
the
brain
,
and
borrow
Graaf
<EOS>
(
this
must
be
a
mistake
in
Mr.
Shandy
;
for
Graaf
write
upon
the
pancreatick
juice
,
and
the
part
of
generation
.
)
<EOS>
upon
the
bone
and
muscle
;
but
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
reason'd
likewise
from
her
own
power
 
lay
down
theorem
 
<EOS>
draw
consequence
,
and
come
to
no
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
to
clear
up
all
,
she
have
twice
ask
Doctor
Slop
,
"
if
poor
captain
Shandy
be
ever
likely
to
recover
of
his
wound
 
?
"
    
<EOS>
He
be
recover
,
Doctor
Slop
would
say
    
what
!
<EOS>
quite
?
  
<EOS>
quite
:
 
<EOS>
madam
    
<EOS>
but
what
do
you
mean
by
a
recovery
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
would
say
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Slop
be
the
bad
man
alive
at
definition
;
and
so
Mrs.
Wadman
could
get
no
knowledge
:
 
in
short
,
there
be
no
way
to
extract
it
,
but
from
my
uncle
Toby
himself
.
  
<EOS>
there
be

I

persuade

get
pretty
near
it

his
discourse
with
Eve

for
the
propensity

deceive

so
great

that
she
should
have
boldness
to
hold
chat
with
the
devil

without

there
be
an
accent
of
humanity
 
<EOS>
how
shall
I
describe
it
?
 
<EOS>
'
tis
an
accent
which
cover
the
part

It

Mrs.

begin
the
attack
with
her
manual
exercise

for
the
corporal
instantly
.

It

full
sorrowful
would
the

understand
the

a

major

I

My

would
rather
have
be
content
to

<EOS>
I
be

therefore
I
still

it

why

My

Toby
lay
down
his

intercede
for
a

and
Yorick
be
rise
up
to
batter
the
whole
hypothesis
to
piece
      
when
Obadiah
break
into
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
complaint
,
which
cry
out
for
an
immediate
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
the
case
be
this
:
  
My
father
,
whether
by
ancient
custom
of
the
manor
,
or
as
impropriator
of
the
great
tythe
,
be
oblige
to
keep
a
Bull
for
the
service
of
the
Parish
,
and
Obadiah
have
lead
his
cow
upon
a
pop
-
visit
to
him
one
day
or
other
the
precede
summer
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
one
day
or
other
 
because
as
chance
would
have
it
,
it
be
the
day
on
which
he
be
married
to
my
father
's
house
-
maid
 
<EOS>
so
one
be
a
reckoning
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
when
Obadiah
's
wife
be
bring
to
bed
 
Obadiah
thank
God
      
now
,
say
Obadiah
,
I
shall
have
a
calf
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
so
Obadiah
go
daily
to
visit
his
cow
.
  
<EOS>
She
will
calve
on
Monday
 
on
Tuesday
 
on
Wednesday
at
the
farth
    
<EOS>
the
cow
do
not
calve
 
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
she
will
not
calve
till
next
week
 
the
cow
put
it
off
terribly
 
till
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
week
<EOS>
Obadiah
's
suspicion
(
like
a
good
man
's
)
fall
upon
the
Bull
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
parish
be
very
large
,
my
father
's
Bull
,
to
speak
the
truth
of
him
,
be
no
way
equal
to
the
department
;
he
have
,
however
,
get
himself
,
somehow
or
other
,
thrust
into
employment
 
and
as
he
go
through
the
business
with
a
grave
face
<EOS>
,
my
father
have
a
high
opinion
of
him
.
    
<EOS>
Most
of
the
townsman
,
an
'
please
your
worship
,
quoth
Obadiah
,
believe
that
'
tis
all
the
Bull
's
fault
      
but
may
not
a
cow
be
barren
?
reply
my
father
,
turn
to
Doctor
Slop
.
  
<EOS>
It
never
happen
:
 
say
Dr.
Slop
,
but
the
man
's
wife
may
have
come
before
her
time
naturally
enough
 
<EOS>
Prithee
have
the
child
hair
upon
his
head
?
 
<EOS>
add
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
      
It
be
as
hairy
as
I

Obadiah
