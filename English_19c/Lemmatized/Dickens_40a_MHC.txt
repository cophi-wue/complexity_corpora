Master
Humphrey
earnestly
hope
,
(
and
be
almost
tempt
to
believe
,
)
that
all
degree
of
reader
,
young
or
old
,
rich
or
poor
,
sad
or
merry
,
easy
of
amusement
or
difficult
to
entertain
,
may
find
something
agreeable
in
the
face
of
his
old
clock
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
when
they
have
make
its
acquaintance
,
its
voice
may
sound
cheerfully
in
their
ear
,
and
be
suggestive
of
none
but
pleasant
thought
.
 
<EOS>
that
they
may
come
to
have
favourite
and
familiar
association
connect
with
its
name
,
and
to
look
for
it
as
for
a
welcome
friend
.
          
<EOS>
from
week
to
week
,
then
,
Master
Humphrey
will
set
his
clock
,
trust
that
while
it
count
the
hour
,
it
will
sometimes
cheat
them
of
their
heaviness
,
and
that
while
it
mark
the
thread
of
Time
,
it
will
scatter
a
few
slight
flower
in
the
Old
Mower
’s
path
.
          
<EOS>
until
the
specified
period
arrive
,
and
he
can
enter
freely
upon
that
confidence
with
his
reader
which
he
be
impatient
to
maintain
,
he
may
only
bid
them
a
short
farewell
,
and
look
forward
to
their
next
meeting
.

PREFACE
to
the
first
volume
         
<EOS>
when
the
author
commence
this
work
,
he
propose
to
himself
three
object
---
           
First
.
 
<EOS>
to
establish
a
periodical
,
which
should
enable
him
to
present
,
under
one
general
head
,
and
not
as
separate
and
distinct
publication
,
certain
fiction
that
he
have
it
in
contemplation
to
write
.
          
<EOS>
secondly
.
 
<EOS>
to
produce
these
tale
in
weekly
number
,
hope
that
to
shorten
the
interval
of
communication
between
himself
and
his
reader
,
would
be
to
knit
more
closely
the
pleasant
relation
they
have
hold
,
for
Forty
Months
.
          
<EOS>
thirdly
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
execution
of
this
weekly
task
,
to
have
as
much
regard
as
its
exigency
would
permit
,
to
each
story
as
a
whole
,
and
to
the
possibility
of
its
publication
at
some
distant
day
,
apart
from
the
machinery
in
which
it
have
its
origin
.
          
<EOS>
the
character
of
Master
Humphrey
and
his
three
friend
,
and
the
little
fancy
of
the
clock
,
be
the
result
of
these
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
seek
to
interest
his
reader
in
those
who
talk
,
and
read
,
and
listen
,
he
revive
Mr.
Pickwick
and
his
humble
friend
;
not
with
any
intention
of
re
-
open
an
exhausted
and
abandon
mine
,
but
to
connect
them
in
the
thought
of
those
whose
favourite
they
have
be
,
with
the
tranquil
enjoyment
of
Master
Humphrey
.
          
<EOS>
It
be
never
the
intention
of
the
author
to
make
the
member
of
Master
Humphrey
’s
clock
,
active
agent
in
the
story
they
be
suppose
to
relate
.
 
<EOS>
have
bring
himself
in
the
commencement
of
his
undertaking
to
feel
an
interest
in
these
quiet
creature
,
and
to
imagine
them
in
their
chamber
of
p.
xvmeeting
,
eager
listener
to
all
he
have
to
tell
,
the
author
hope
—
as
author
will
—
to
succeed
in
awaken
some
of
his
own
emotion
in
the
bosom
of
his
reader
.
 
<EOS>
Imagining
Master
Humphrey
in
his
chimney
corner
,
resume
night
after
night
<EOS>
the
narrative,—say
,
of
the
Old
Curiosity
Shop
—
picture
to
himself
the
various
sensation
of
his
hearer
—
think
how
Jack
Redburn
may
incline
to
poor
kit
,
and
perhaps
lean
too
favourably
even
towards
the
light
vice
of
Mr.
Richard
Swiveller
—
how
the
deaf
gentleman
would
have
his
favourite
and
Mr.
Miles
his
—
and
how
all
these
gentle
spirit
would
trace
some
faint
reflexion
in
their
past
life
in
the
varying
current
of
the
tale
<EOS>
—
he
have
insensibly
fall
into
the
belief
that
they
be
present
to
his
reader
as
they
be
to
him
,
and
have
forget
that
,
like
one
whose
vision
be
disorder
,
he
may
be
conjure
up
bright
figure
when
there
be
nothing
but
empty
space
.
          
<EOS>
the
short
paper
which
be
to
be
find
at
the
beginning
of
the
volume
be
indispensable
to
the
form
of
publication
and
the
limited
extent
of
each
number
,
as
no
story
of
length
or
interest
could
be
begin
until
"
the
Clock
be
wind
up
and
fairly
go
.
"
          
<EOS>
the
author
would
fain
hope
that
there
be
not
many
who
would
disturb
Master
Humphrey
and
his
friend
in
their
seclusion
;
who
would
have
them
forego
their
present
enjoyment
,
to
exchange
those
confidence
with
each
other
,
the
absence
of
which
be
the
foundation
of
their
mutual
trust
.
 
<EOS>
for
when
their
occupation
be
go
,
when
their
tale
be
end
,
and
but
their
personal
history
remain
,
the
chimney
corner
will
be
grow
cold
,
and
the
clock
will
be
about
to
stop
for
ever
.
          
<EOS>
one
other
word
in
his
own
person
,
and
he
return
to
the
more
grateful
task
of
speak
for
those
imaginary
people
whose
little
world
lie
within
these
page
.
          
<EOS>
It
may
be
some
consolation
to
those
well
-
dispose
lady
and
gentleman
who
,
in
the
interval
between
the
conclusion
of
his
last
work
and
the
commencement
of
this
,
originate
a
report
that
he
have
go
rave
mad
,
to
know
that
it
spread
p.
xvias
rapidly
as
could
be
desire
,
and
be
make
the
subject
of
considerable
dispute
;
not
as
regard
the
fact
,
for
<EOS>
that
be
as
thoroughly
establish
as
the
duel
between
Sir
Peter
Teazle
and
Charles
Surface
in
the
School
for
Scandal
;
but
with
reference
to
the
unfortunate
lunatic
’s
place
of
confinement
;
one
party
insist
positively
on
Bedlam
,
another
incline
favourably
towards
St.
Luke
’s
,
and
a
third
swearing
strongly
by
the
asylum
at
Hanwell
;
while
each
back
its
case
by
circumstantial
evidence
of
the
same
excellent
nature
as
that
bring
to
bear
by
Sir
Benjamin
Backbite
on
the
pistol
shot
which
strike
against
the
little
bronze
bust
of
Shakespeare
over
the
fireplace
,
graze
out
of
the
window
at
a
right
angle
,
and
wound
the
postman
,
who
be
come
to
the
door
with
a
double
letter
from
Northamptonshire
.
          
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
great
affliction
to
these
lady
and
gentleman
to
learn
—
and
he
be
so
unwilling
to
give
pain
,
that
he
would
not
whisper
the
circumstance
on
any
account
,
do
he
not
feel
in
a
manner
bind
to
do
so
,
in
gratitude
to
those
amongst
his
friend
who
be
at
the
trouble
of
be
angry
at
the
absurdity
that
their
invention
make
the
author
<EOS>
’s
home
unusually
merry
,
and
give
rise
to
an
extraordinary
number
of
jest
,
of
which
he
will
only
add
,
in
the
word
of
the
good
Vicar
of
Wakefield
,
"
I
can
not
say
whether
we
have
more
wit
among
us
than
usual
;
but
I
be
sure
we
have
more
laugh
.

<EOS>
"
an
author
,
"
say
fielding
,
in
his
introduction
to
Tom
Jones
,
"
ought
to
consider
himself
,
not
as
the
gentleman
who
give
a
private
or
eleemosynary
treat
,
but
rather
as
one
who
keep
a
public
ordinary
,
to
which
all
person
be
welcome
for
their
money
.
 
<EOS>
man
who
pay
for
what
they
eat
,
will
insist
on
gratify
their
palate
,
however
nice
and
whimsical
these
may
prove
;
and
if
everything
be
not
agreeable
to
their
taste
,
will
challenge
a
right
to
censure
,
to
abuse
,
and
to
damn
their
dinner
without
control
.
          
<EOS>
"
to
prevent
,
therefore
,
give
offence
to
their
customer
by
any
such
disappointment
,
it
hath
be
usual
with
the
honest
and
well
-
mean
host
to
provide
a
bill
of
fare
,
which
all
person
may
peruse
at
their
first
entrance
into
the
house

and
have
thence
acquaint
themselves
with
the
entertainment
which
they

expect

may
either
stay

regale
with
what
be
provide

them

may
depart
to
some
other
ordinary
better
accommodate
to
their
taste

"
              
<EOS>
in
the
present
instance
,
the
host
or
author
,
in
open
his
new
establishment
,
provide
no
bill
of
fare
.
 
<EOS>
sensible
of
the
difficulty
of
such
an
undertaking
in
its
infancy
,
he
prefer
that
it
should
make
its
own
way
,
silently
and
gradually
,
or
make
no
way
at
all

<EOS>
It
have
make
its
way
,
and
be
do
such
a
thriving
business
that
nothing
remain
for
him

to
add
,
in
the
word
of
the
good
old
civic
ceremony
,
now
that

<EOS>
I
 
Master
Humphrey
,
from
his
clock
-
side
in
the
chimney
corner
 
<EOS>
the
reader
must
not
expect
to
know
where
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
at
present
,
it
be
true
,
my
abode
may
be
a
question
of
little
or
no
import
to
anybody
;
but
if
I
should
carry
my
reader
with
me
,
as
I
hope
to
do
,
and
there
should
spring
up
between
them
and
me
feeling
of
homely
affection
and
regard
attach
something
of
interest
to
matter
ever
so
slightly
connected
with
my
fortune
or
my
speculation
,
even
my
place
of
residence
may
one
day
have
a
kind
of
charm
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
bear
this
possible
contingency
in
mind
,
I
wish
them
to
understand
,
in
the
outset
,
that
they
must
never
expect
to
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
churlish
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
Friendless
<EOS>
I
can
never
be
,
for
all
mankind
be
my
kindred
,
and
I
be
on
ill
term
with
no
one
member
of
my
great
family
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
many
year
I
have
lead
a
lonely
,
solitary
life
;
---
what
wound
I
seek
to
heal
,
what
sorrow
to
forget
,
originally
,
matter
not
now
;
it
be
sufficient
that
retirement
have
become
a
habit
with
me
,
and
that
I
be
unwilling
to
break
the
spell
which
for
so
long
a
time
have
shed
its
quiet
influence
upon
my
home
and
heart
.
   
<EOS>
I
live
in
a
venerable
suburb
of
London
,
in
an
old
house
which
in
bygone
day
be
a
famous
resort
for
merry
roysterer
and
peerless
lady
,
long
since
depart
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
silent
,
shady
place
,
with
a
paved
courtyard
so
full
of
echo
,
that
sometimes
I
be
tempt
to
believe
that
faint
response
to
the
noise
of
old
time
linger
there
yet
,
and
that
these
ghost
of
sound
haunt
my
footstep
as
I
pace
it
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
more
confirm
in
this
belief
,
because
,
of
late
year
,
the
echo
that
attend
my
walk
have
be
less
loud
and
mark
than
they
be
will
not
to
be
;
and
it
be
pleasanter
to
imagine
in
them
the
rustling
of
silk
brocade
,
and
the
light
step
of
some
lovely
girl
,
than
to
recognise
in
their
alter
note
the
fail
tread
of
an
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
those
who
like
to
read
of
brilliant
room
and
gorgeous
furniture
would
derive
but
little
pleasure
from
a
minute
description
of
my
simple
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dear
to
me
for
the
same
reason
that
they
would
hold
it
in
slight
regard
.
 
<EOS>
Its
worm
-
eat
door
,
and
low
ceiling
cross
by
clumsy
beam
;
its
wall
of
wainscot
,
dark
stair
,
and
gape
closet
;
its
small
chamber
,
communicate
with
each
other
by
wind
passage
or
narrow
step
<EOS>
;
its
many
nook
,
scarce
large
than
its
corner
-
cupboard
;
its
very
dust
and
dulness
,
be
all
dear
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
moth
and
spider
be
my
constant
tenant
;
for
in
my
house
the
one
bask
in
his
long
sleep
,
and
the
other
ply
his
busy
loom
secure
and
undisturbed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
pleasure
in
think
on
a
summer
's
day
how
many
butterfly
have
spring
for
the
first
time
into
light
and
sunshine
from
some
dark
corner
of
these
old
wall
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
first
come
to
live
here
,
<EOS>
which
be
many
year
ago
,
the
neighbour
be
curious
to
know
who
I
be
,
and
whence
I
come
,
and
why
I
live
so
much
alone
.
 
<EOS>
as
time
go
on
,
and
they
still
remain
unsatisfied
on
these
point
,
I
become
the
centre
of
a
popular
ferment
,
extend
for
half
a
mile
round
,
and
in
one
direction
for
a
full
mile
.
 
<EOS>
various
rumour
be
circulate
to
my
prejudice
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
spy
,
an
infidel
,
a
conjurer
,
a
kidnapper
of
child
,
a
refugee
,
a
priest
,
a
monster
.
 
<EOS>
mother
catch
up
their
infant
and
run
into
their
house
as
I
pass
;
man
eye
me
spitefully
,
and
muttered
threat
and
curse
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
object
of
suspicion
and
distrust
---
<EOS>
ay
,
of
downright
hatred
too
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
in
course
of
time
they
find
I
do
no
harm
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
incline
towards
them
despite
their
unjust
usage
,
they
begin
to
relent
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
my
footstep
no
longer
dog
,
as
they
have
often
be
before
,
and
observe
that
the
woman
and
child
no
longer
retreat
,
but
would
stand
and
gaze
at
me
as
I
pass
their
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
this
for
a
good
oman
,
and
wait
patiently
for
well
time
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
I
begin
to
make
friend
among
these
humble
folk
;
and
though
they
be
yet
shy
of
speak
,
would
give
them
"
good
day
,
"
and
so
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
,
those
whom
I
have
thus
accost
would
make
a
point
of
come
to
their
door
and
window
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
nod
or
courtesy
to
me
;
child
,
too
,
come
timidly
within
my
reach
,
and
run
away
quite
scared
when
I
pat
their
head
and
bade
them
be
good
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
these
little
people
soon
grow
more
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
from
exchange
mere
word
of
course
with
my
old
neighbour
,
I
gradually
become
their
friend
and
adviser
,
the
depositary
of
their
care
and
sorrow
,
and
sometimes
,
it
may
be
,
the
reliever
,
in
my
small
way
,
of
their
distress
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
never
walk
abroad
but
<EOS>
pleasant
recognition
and
smile
face
wait
on
Master
Humphrey
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
whim
of
mine
,
perhaps
as
a
whet
to
the
curiosity
of
my
neighbour
,
and
a
kind
of
retaliation
upon
them
for
their
suspicion
---
<EOS>
it
be
,
I
say
,
a
whim
of
mine
,
when
I
first
take
up
my
abode
in
this
place
,
to
acknowledge
no
other
name
than
Humphrey
.
<EOS>
with
my
detractor
,
I
be
Ugly
Humphrey
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
begin
to
convert
them
into
friend
,
I
be
Mr
Humphrey
and
Old
Mr
Humphrey
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
settle
down
into
plain
Master
Humphrey
,
which
be
understand
to
be
the
title
most
pleasant
to
my
ear
;
and
so
completely
a
matter
of
course
have
it
become
,
that
sometimes
when
I
be
take
my
morning
walk
in
my
little
courtyard
,
I
overhear
my
barber
---
who
have
a
profound
respect
for
me
,
and
would
not
,
I
be
sure
,
abridge
my
honour
for
the
world
---
hold
forth
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
,
touch
the
state
of
"
Master
Humphrey
's
"
health
,
and
communicate
to
some
friend
the
substance
of
the
conversation
that
he
and
Master
Humphrey
have
have
together
in
the
course
of
the
shaving
which
he
have
just
conclude
.
   
<EOS>
that
I
may
not
make
acquaintance
with
my
reader
under
false
pretence
,
or
give
them
cause
to
complain
hereafter
that
I
have
withhold
any
matter
which
it
be
essential
for
them
to
have
learn
at
first
,
I
wish
them
to
know
---
and
I
smile
sorrowfully
to
think
that
the
time
have
be
when
the
confession
would
have
give
me
pain
---
that
I
be
a
misshapen
,
deform
old
man
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
make
a
misanthrope
by
this
cause
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
sting
by
any
insult
,
nor
wound
by
any
jest
upon
my
crooked
figure
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
child
I
be
melancholy
and
timid
,
but
that
be
because
the
gentle
consideration
pay
to
my
misfortune
sink
deep
into
my
spirit
and
make
me
sad
,
even
in
those
early
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
but
a
very
young
creature
when
my
poor
mother
die
,
and
yet
I
remember
that
often
when
I
hang
around
her
neck
,
and
oftener
still
when
I
play
about
the
room
before
her
,
she
would
catch
me
to
her
bosom
,
and
burst
into
tear
,
would
soothe
me
with
every
term
of
fondness
and
affection
.
 
<EOS>
God
know
I
be
a
happy
child
at
those
time
,
---
happy
to
nestle
in
her
breast
,
---
happy
to
weep
when
she
do
,
---
happy
in
not
know
why
.
   
<EOS>
these
occasion
be
so
strongly
impressed
upon
my
memory
,
that
they
seem
to
have
occupy
whole
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
number
very
,
very
few
when
they
cease
for
ever
,
but
before
then
their
meaning
have
be
reveal
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
all
child
be
imbue
with
a
quick
perception
of
childish
grace
and
beauty
,
and
a
strong
love
for
it
,
but
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
thought
that
I
remember
,
either
that
I
possess
it
myself
or
that
I
lack
it
,
but
I
admire
it
with
an
intensity
that
I
can
not
describe
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
knot
of
playmate
<EOS>
---
they
must
have
be
beautiful
,
for
I
see
them
now
---
be
cluster
one
day
round
my
mother
's
knee
in
eager
admiration
of
some
picture
represent
a
group
of
infant
angel
,
which
she
hold
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
whose
the
picture
be
,
whether
it
be
familiar
to
me
or
otherwise
,
or
how
all
the
child
come
to
be
there
,
I
forget
;
<EOS>
I
have
some
dim
thought
it
be
my
birthday
,
but
the
beginning
of
my
recollection
be
that
we
be
all
together
in
a
garden
,
and
it
be
summer
weather
,
---
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
that
,
for
one
of
the
little
girl
have
rose
in
her
sash
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
lovely
angel
in
this
picture
,
and
I
remember
the
fancy
come
upon
me
to
point
out
which
of
them
represent
each
child
there
,
and
that
when
I
have
go
through
my
companion
,
I
stop
and
hesitate
,
wonder
which
be
most
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
child
look
at
each
other
,
and
my
turn
red
and
hot
,
and
their
crowding
round
to
kiss
me
,
say
that
they
love
me
all
the
same
;
and
then
,
and
when
the
old
sorrow
come
into
my
dear
mother
's
mild
and
tender
look
,
the
truth
break
upon
me
for
the
first
time
,
and
I
know
,
while
watch
my
awkward
and
ungainly
sport
,
how
keenly
she
have
feel
for
her
poor
crippled
boy
.
   
<EOS>
I
use
frequently
to
dream
of
it
afterwards
,
and
now
my
heart
ache
for
that
child
as
if
I
have
never
be
he
,
when
I
think
how
often
he
awake
from
some
fairy
change
to
his
own
old
form
,
and
sob
himself
to
sleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
---
all
these
sorrow
be
past
.
 
<EOS>
My
glance
at
them
may
not
be
without
its
use
,
for
it
may
help
in
some
measure
to
explain
why
I
have
<EOS>
all
my
life
be
attach
to
the
inanimate
object
that
people
my
chamber
,
and
how
I
have
come
to
look
upon
them
rather
in
the
light
of
old
and
constant
friend
,
than
as
mere
chair
and
table
which
a
little
money
could
replace
at
will
.
   
<EOS>
chief
and
<EOS>
first
among
all
these
be
my
Clock
,
---
my
old
,
cheerful
,
companionable
Clock
.
 
<EOS>
how
can
I
ever
convey
to
other
an
idea
of
the
comfort
and
consolation
that
this
old
Clock
have
be
for
year
to
me
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
associate
with
my
early
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
It
stand
upon
the
staircase
at
home
<EOS>
(
I
call
it
home
still
mechanically
)
,
nigh
sixty
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
for
that
;
but
it
be
not
on
that
account
,
nor
because
it
be
a
quaint
old
thing
in
a
huge
oaken
case
curiously
and
richly
carve
,
that
I
prize
it
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
incline
to
it
as
if
it
be
alive
,
and
could
understand
and
give
me
back
the
love
I
bear
it
.
   
<EOS>
and
what
other
thing
that
have
not
life
could
cheer
me
as
it
do
?
<EOS>
what
other
thing
that
have
not
life
(
I
will
not
say
how
few
thing
that
have
)
could
have
prove
the
same
patient
,
true
,
untire
friend
?
 
<EOS>
how
often
have
I
sit
in
the
long
winter
evening
feel
such
society
in
its
cricket
-
voice
,
that
raise
my
eye
from
my
book
and
look
gratefully
towards
it
,
the
face
redden
by
the
glow
of
the
shine
fire
have
seem
to
relax
from
its
staid
expression
and
to
regard
me
kindly
!
<EOS>
how
often
in
the
summer
twilight
,
when
my
thought
have
wander
back
to
a
melancholy
past
,
have
its
regular
whispering
recall
them
to
the
calm
and
peaceful
present
!
<EOS>
how
often
in
the
dead
tranquillity
of
night
have
its
bell
break
the
oppressive
silence
,
and
seem
to
give
me
assurance
that
the
old
clock
be
still
a
faithful
watcher
at
my
chamber
-
door
!
 
<EOS>
My
easy
-
chair
,
my
desk
,
my
ancient
furniture
,
my
very
book
,
I
can
scarcely
bring
myself
to
love
even
these
last
like
my
old
clock
.
   
<EOS>
It
stand
in
a
snug
corner
,
midway
between
the
fireside
and
a
low
arched
door
lead
to
my
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
Its
fame
be
diffuse
so
extensively
throughout
the
neighbourhood
,
that
I
have
often
the
satisfaction
of
hear
the
publican
,
or
the
baker
,
and
sometimes
even
the
parish
-
clerk
,
petition
my
housekeeper
(
of
whom
I
shall
have
much
to
say
by
-
and
-
by
)
to
inform
him
the
exact
time
by
Master
Humphrey
's
clock
.
 
<EOS>
My
barber
,
to
whom
I
have
refer
,
would
sooner
believe
it
than
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
these
its
only
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
acquire
,
I
be
happy
to
say
,
another
,
inseparably
connect
it
not
only
with
my
enjoyment
and
reflection
,
but
with
those
of
other
man
;
as
I
shall
now
relate
.
   
<EOS>
I
live
alone
here
for
a
long
time
without
any
friend
or
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
my
wandering
by
night
and
day
,
at
all
hour
and
season
,
in
city
street
and
quiet
country
part
,
I
come
to
be
familiar
with
certain
face
,
and
to
take
it
to
heart
as
quite
a
heavy
disappointment
if
they
fail
to
present
themselves
each
at
its
accustomed
spot
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
be
the
only
friend
I
know
,
and
beyond
them
I
have
none
.
   
<EOS>
It
happen
,
however
,
when
I
have
go
on
thus
for
a
long
time
,
that
I
form
an
acquaintance
with
a
deaf
gentleman
,
which
ripen
into
intimacy
and
close
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
hour
,
I
be
ignorant
of
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
humour
to
conceal
it
,
or
he
have
a
reason
and
purpose
for
so
do
.
 
<EOS>
in
either
case
,
I
feel
that
he
have
a
right
to
require
a
return
of
the
trust
he
have
repose
;
and
as
he
have
never
seek
to
discover
my
secret
,
I
have
never
seek
to
penetrate
his
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
something
in
this
tacit
confidence
in
each
other
flattering
and
pleasant
to
us
both
,
and
it
may
have
impart
in
the
beginning
an
additional
zest
,
perhaps
,
to
our
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
we
have
grow
to
be
like
brother
,
and
still
I
only
know
him
as
the
deaf
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
retirement
have
become
a
habit
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
add
,
that
the
deaf
gentleman
and
I
have
two
friend
,
I
communicate
nothing
which
be
inconsistent
with
that
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
I
spend
many
hour
of
every
day
in
solitude
and
study
,
have
no
friend
or
change
of
friend
<EOS>
but
these
,
only
see
them
at
state
period
,
and
be
suppose
to
be
of
a
retired
spirit
by
the
very
nature
and
object
of
our
association
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
man
of
secluded
habit
,
with
something
of
a
cloud
upon
our
early
fortune
,
whose
enthusiasm
,
nevertheless
,
have
not
cool
with
age
,
whose
spirit
of
romance
be
not
yet
quench
,
who
be
content
to
ramble
through
the
world
in
a
pleasant
dream
,
rather
than
ever
waken
again
to
its
harsh
reality
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
alchemist
who
would
extract
the
essence
of
perpetual
youth
from
dust
and
ashe
,
tempt
coy
truth
in
many
light
and
airy
form
from
the
bottom
of
her
well
,
and
discover
one
crumb
of
comfort
or
one
grain
of
good
in
the
common
and
least
-
regarded
matter
that
pass
through
our
crucible
.
 
<EOS>
spirit
of
past
time
,
creature
of
imagination
,
and
people
of
to
-
day
be
alike
the
object
of
our
seeking
,
and
,
unlike
the
object
of
search
with
most
philosopher
,
we
can
insure
their
come
at
our
command
.
   
<EOS>
the
deaf
gentleman
<EOS>
and
I
first
begin
to
beguile
our
day
with
these
fancy
,
and
our
night
in
communicate
them
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
now
four
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
my
room
there
be
six
old
chair
,
and
we
have
decide
that
the
two
empty
seat
shall
always
be
place
at
our
table
when
we
meet
,
to
remind
us
that
we
may
yet
increase
our
company
by
that
number
,
if
we
should
find
two
man
to
our
mind
.
<EOS>
when
one
among
us
die
,
his
chair
will
always
be
set
in
its
usual
place
,
but
never
occupy
again
;
and
I
have
cause
my
will
to
be
so
draw
out
,
that
when
we
be
all
dead
the
house
shall
be
shut
up
,
and
the
vacant
chair
still
leave
in
their
accustomed
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
think
that
even
then
our
shade
may
,
perhaps
,
assemble
together
as
of
yore
we
do
,
and
join
in
ghostly
converse
.
   
<EOS>
one
night
in
every
week
,
as
the
clock
strike
ten
,
we
meet
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
second
stroke
of
two
,
I
be
alone
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
shall
I
tell
how
that
my
old
servant
,
besides
give
us
note
of
time
,
and
tick
cheerful
encouragement
of
our
proceeding
,
lend
its
name
to
our
society
,
which
for
its
punctuality
and
my
love
be
christen
"
Master

Clock

?
<EOS>
now
shall
I
tell
how
that
in
the
bottom
of
the
old
dark
closet
,
where
the
steady
pendulum
throbs
and
beat
with
healthy
action
,
though
the
pulse
of
him
who
make
it
stand
still
long
ago
,
and
never
move
again
,
there
be
pile
of
dusty
paper
constantly
place
there
by
our
hand
,
that
we
may
link
our
enjoyment
with
my
old
friend
,
and
draw
mean
to
beguile
time
from
the
heart
of
time
itself
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
,
or
can
I
,
tell
with
what
a
secret
pride
<EOS>
I
open
this
repository
when
we
meet
at
night
,
and
still
find
new
store
of
pleasure
in
my
dear
old
Clock
?
   
<EOS>
friend
and
companion
of
my
solitude
!
<EOS>
mine
be
not
a
selfish
love
;
I
would
not
keep
your
merit
to
myself
,
but
disperse
something
of
pleasant
association
with
your
image
through
the
whole
wide
world
;
I
would
have
man
couple
with
your

cheerful
and
healthy

;
I
would
have
them
believe
that
you
keep
true

honest

and
how
it
would
gladden
me
to
know
that
they
recognise
some
hearty
english
work
in

intention
constantly
to
address
my
reader
from
the
chimney
-
corner
,
and
I
would
fain
hope
that
such
account
as
I
shall
give
them
of
our
history
and
proceeding
,
our
quiet
speculation
or
more
busy
adventure
,
will
never
be
unwelcome
.
 
<EOS>
Lest
,
however
,
I
should
grow
prolix
in
the
outset
by
linger
too
long
upon
our
little
association
,
confound
the
enthusiasm
with
which
I
regard
this
chief
happiness
of
my
life
with
that
minor
degree
of
interest
which
those
to
whom
I
address
myself
may
be
suppose
to
feel
for
it
,
I
have
deem
it
expedient
to
break
off
as
they
have
see
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
still
cling
to
my
old
friend
,
and
naturally
desirous
that
all
its
merit
should
be
know
,
I
be
tempt
to
open
(
somewhat
irregularly
and
against
our
law
,
I
must
admit
)
<EOS>
the
clock
-
case
.
<EOS>
the
first
roll
of
paper
on
which
I
lay
my
hand
be
in
the
writing
of
the
deaf
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
speak
of
him
in
my
next
paper
;
and
how
can
I
better
approach
that
welcome
task
than
by
preface
it
with
a
production
of
his
own
pen
,
consign
to
the
safe
keeping
of
my
honest
Clock
by
his

Introduction
to
the
giant
chronicle
 
once
upon
a
time
,
that
be
to

,
month

and
day

of
no
matter

a
substantial

in
his
single
person
the
dignity
of
wholesale
fruiterer
,
alderman
,
common

councilman
,
and
member
of
the
worshipful
Company
of
Patten
-
maker
;
who
have
superadde
to
these
extraordinary
distinction
the
important
post
and
title
of
Sheriff
,
and
who
at
length
,
and
to
crown
all
,
stand
next
in
rotation
for
the
high
and
honourable
office
of
Lord
Mayor
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
substantial
citizen
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
be
like
the
full
moon
in
a
fog
,
with
two
little
hole
punch
out
for
his
eye
,
a
very
ripe
pear
stick
on
for
his
nose
,
and
a
wide
gash
to
serve
for
a
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
the
girth
of
his
waistcoat
be
hang
up
and
letter
in
his
tailor
's
shop
as
an
extraordinary
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
He
breathe
like
a
heavy
snorer
,
and
his
voice
in
speaking
come
thickly
forth
,
as
if
it
be
oppress
and
stifle
by
feather
-
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
tread
the
ground
like
an
elephant
,
and
eat
and
drank
like
---
like
nothing
but
an
alderman
,
as
he
be
.
   
<EOS>
this
worthy
citizen
have
rise
to
his
great
eminence
from
small
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
once
be
a
very
lean
,
weazen
<EOS>
little
boy
,
never
dream
of
carry
such
a
weight
of
flesh
upon
his
bone
or
of
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
glad
enough
to
take
his
dinner
at
a
baker
's
door
,
and
his
tea
at
a
pump
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
long
ago
forget
all
this
,
as
it
be
proper
that
a
wholesale
fruiterer
,
alderman
,
common

councilman
,
member

past
sheriff
,
and
,
above
all
,
a
Lord
Mayor
that
be
to
be
,
should
;
and
he
never
forget
it
more
completely
in
all
his
life
than
on
the
eighth
of
November
in
the
year
of
his
election
to
the
great
golden
civic
chair
,
which
be
the
day
before
his
grand
dinner
at
Guildhall
.
   
<EOS>
It
happen
that
as
he
sit
that
evening
all
alone
in
his
counting-
house
,
look
over
the
bill
of
fare
for
next
day
,
and
check
off
the
fat
capon
in
fifty
,
and
the
turtle
-
soup
by
the
hundred
quart
,
for
his
private
amusement
,
---
it
happen
that
as
he
sit
alone
occupy
in
these
pleasant
calculation
,
a
strange
man
come
in
and
ask
him
how
he
do
,
add
,
"
if
I
be
half
as
much
change
as
you
,
sir
,
you
have
no
recollection
of
me
,
I
be
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
strange
man
be
not
over
and
above
well
dress
,
and
be
very
far
from
be
fat
or
rich
-
look
in
any
sense
of
the
word
,
yet
he
speak
with
a
kind
of
modest
confidence
,
and
assume
an
easy
,
gentlemanly
sort
of
an
air
,
to
which
nobody
but
a
rich
man
can
lawfully
presume
.
 
<EOS>

,
and

and

"
You

<EOS>
You

Lord

elect
pettishly
.
 
<EOS>
"
do

<EOS>

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
why
,
I
think
you
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
fellow
you
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
a
pretty
state
of
thing
,
and
worthy
the
tone
of
vexation
and
disappointment
in
which
the
Lord
Mayor
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
Toddyhigh
have
be
a
poor
boy
with
him
at
Hull
,
and
have
oftentime
divide
his
last
penny
and
part
his
last
crust
to
relieve
his
want
;
for
though
Joe
be
a
destitute
child
in
those
time
,
he
be
as
faithful
and
affectionate
in
his
friendship
as
ever
man
of
might
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
part
one
day
to
seek
their
fortune
in
different
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
go
to
sea
,
and
the
now
wealthy
citizen
beg
his
way
to
London
<EOS>
,
They
separate
with
many
tear
,
like
foolish
fellow
as
they
be
,
and
agree
to
remain
fast
friend
,
and
if
they
live
,
soon
to
communicate
again
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
be
an
errand
-
boy
,
and
even
in
the
early
day
of
his
apprenticeship
,
the
citizen
have
many
a
time
trudge
to
the
Post-
office
to
ask
if
there
be
any
letter
from
poor
little
Joe
,
and
have
go
home
again
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
when
he
find
no
news
of
his
only
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
world
be
a
wide
place
,
and
it
be
a
long
time
before
the
letter
come
;
when
it
do
,
the
writer
be
forget
.
<EOS>
It
turn
from
white
to
yellow
from
lie
in
the
Post
-
office
with
nobody
to
claim
it
,
and
in
course
of
time
be
tear
up
with
five
hundred
other
,
and
sell
for
waste
-
paper
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
at
last
,
and
when
it
may
least
have
be
expect
,
here
be
this
Joe
Toddyhigh
turn
up
and
claim
acquaintance
with
a
great
public
character
,
who
on
the
morrow
would
be
crack
joke
with
the
Prime
Minister
of
England
,
and
who
have
only
,
at
any
time
during
the
next
twelve
month
,
to
say
the
word
,
and
he
could
shut
up
Temple
Bar
,
and
make
it
no
thoroughfare
for
the
king
himself
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
,
Mr
Toddyhigh
,
"
say
the
Lord
Mayor
elect
;
"
I
really
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
inconvenient
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
have
give
twenty
pound
,
---
it
be
very
inconvenient
,
really
.
"
<EOS>
---
a
thought
have
come
into
his
mind
,
that
perhaps
his
old
friend
may
say
something
passionate
which
would
give
him
an
excuse
for
be
angry
himself
.
 
<EOS>
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Joe
look
at
him
steadily
,
but
very
mildly
,
and
do
not
open
his
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
shall
pay
you
what
I
owe
you
,
"
say
the
Lord
Mayor
elect
,
fidget
in
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
lend
me
---
I
think
it
be
a
shilling
or
some
small
coin
---
when
we
part
company
,
and
that
of
course
I
shall
pay
with
good
interest
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
pay
my
way
with
any
man
,
and
always
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
look
into
the
Mansion
House
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
---
some
time
after
dusk
,
---
and
ask
for
my
private
clerk
,
you
will
find
he
have
a
draft
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
get
time
to
say
anything
more
just
now
,
unless
,
"
---
he
hesitate
,
for
,
couple
with
a
strong
desire
to
glitter
for
once
in
all
his
glory
in
the
eye
of
his
former
companion
,
be
a
distrust
of
his
appearance
,
which
may
be
more
shabby
than
he
could
tell
by
that
feeble
light
,
---
"
unless
you
would
like
to
come
to
the
dinner
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
your
have
this
ticket
,
if
you
like
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
many
people
would
give
their
ear
for
it
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
old
friend
take
the
card
without
speak
a
word
,
and
instantly
depart
.
 
<EOS>
His
sunburnt
face
and
gray
hair
be
present
to
the
citizen
's
mind
for
a
moment
;
but
by
the
time
he
reach
three
hundred
and
eighty
-
one
fat
capon
,
he
have
quite
forget
him
.
   
<EOS>
Joe
Toddyhigh
have
never
be
in
the
capital
of
Europe
before
,
and
he
wander
up
and
down
the
street
that
night
amazed
at
the
number
of
church
and
other
public
building
,
the
splendour
of
the
shop
,
the
rich
that
be
heap
up
on
every
side
,
the
glare
of
light
in
which
they
be
display
,
and
the
concourse
of
people
who
hurry
to
and
fro
,
indifferent
,
apparently
,
to
all
the
wonder
that
surround
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
all
the
long
street
and
broad
square
,
there
be
none
but
stranger
;
it
be
quite
a
relief
to
turn
down
a
by
-
way
and
hear
his
own
footstep
on
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
home
to
his
inn
,
think
that
London
be
a
dreary
,
desolate
place
,
and
feel
disposed
to
doubt
the
existence
of
one
true
-
hearted
man
in
the
whole
worshipful
Company
of
Patten
-
maker
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
he
go
to
bed
,
and
dream
that
he
and
the
Lord
Mayor
elect
be
boy
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
go
next
day
to
the
dinner
;
and
when
in
a
burst
of
light
and
music
,
and
in
the
midst
of
splendid
decoration
and
surround
by
brilliant
company
,
his
former
friend
appear
at
the
head
of
the
Hall
,
and
be
hail
with
shout
and
cheering
,
he
cheer
and
shout
with
the
good
,
and
for
the
moment
could
have
cry
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
moment
he
curse
his
weakness
in
behalf
of
a
man
so
changed
and
selfish
,
and
quite
hate
a
jolly
-
look
old
gentleman
opposite
for
declare
himself
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
a
Patten
-
maker
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
banquet
proceed
,
he
take
more
and
more
to
heart
the
rich
citizen
's
unkindness
;
and
that
,
not
from
any
envy
,
but
because
he
feel
that
a
man
of
his
state
and
fortune
could
all
the
well
afford
to
recognise
an
old
friend
,
even
if
he
be
poor
and
obscure
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
he
think
of
this
,
the
more
lonely
and
sad
he
feel
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
company
disperse
and
adjourn
to
the
ball
-
room
,
he
pace
the
hall
and
passage
alone
,
ruminate
in
a
very
melancholy
condition
upon
the
disappointment
he
have
experience
.
   
<EOS>
It
chance
,
while
he
be
lounge
about
in
this
moody
state
,
that
he
stumble
upon
a
flight
of
stair
,
dark
,
steep
,
and
narrow
,
which
he
ascend
without
any
thought
about
the
matter
,
and
so
come
into
a
little
music
-
gallery
,
empty
and
desert
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
elevated
post
,
which
command
the
whole
hall
,
he
amuse
himself
in
look
down
upon
the
attendant
who
be
clear
away
the
fragment
of
the
feast
very
lazily
,
and
drink
out
of
all
the
bottle
and
glass
with
most
commendable
perseverance
.
   
<EOS>
His
attention
gradually
relaxed
,
and
he
fall
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
awake
,
he
think
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
his
eye
;
but
,
rub
them
a
little
,
he
soon
find
that
the
moonlight
be
really
stream
through
the
east
window
,
that
the
lamp
be
all
extinguish
,
and
that
he
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
,
but
no
distant
murmur
in
the
echo
passage
,
not
even
the
shutting
of
a
door
,
break
the
deep
silence
;
he
grope
his
way
down
the
stair
,
and
find
that
the
door
at
the
bottom
be
lock
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
now
to
comprehend
that
he
must
have
sleep
a
long
time
,
that
he
have
be
overlook
,
and
be
shut
up
there
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
His
first
sensation
,
perhaps
,
be
not
altogether
a
comfortable
one
,
for
it
be
a
dark
,
chilly
,
earthy
-
smell
place
,
and
something
too
large
,
for
a
man
so
situated
,
to
feel
at
home
in
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
when
the
momentary
consternation
of
his
surprise
be
over
,
he
make
light
of
the
accident
,
and
resolve
to
feel
his
way
up
the
stair
again
,
and
make
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
could
in
the
gallery
until
morning
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
turn
to
execute
this
purpose
,
he
hear
the
clock
strike
three
.
   
<EOS>
any
such
invasion
of
a
dead
stillness
as
the
striking
of
distant
clock
,
cause
it
to
appear
the
more
intense
and
insupportable
when
the
sound
have
cease
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
with
strained
attention
in
the
hope
that
some
clock
,
lag
behind
its
fellow
,
have
yet
to
strike
,
---
look
all
the
time
into
the
profound
darkness
before
him
,
until
it
seem
to
weave
itself
into
a
black
tissue
,
pattern
with
a
hundred
reflection
of
his
own
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
bell
have
all
peal
out
their
warning
for
that
once
,
and
the
gust
of
wind
that
moan
through
the
place
seem
cold
and
heavy
with
their
iron
breath
.
   
<EOS>
the
time
and
circumstance
be
favourable
to
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
keep
his
thought
to
the
current
,
unpleasant
though
it
be
,
in
which
they
have
move
all
day
,
and
to
think
with
what
a
romantic
feeling
he
have
look
forward
to
shake
his
old
friend
by
the
hand
before
he
die
,
and
what
a
wide
and
cruel
difference
there
be
between
the
meeting
they
have
have
,
and
that
which
he
have
so
often
and
so
long
anticipate
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
he
be
disorder
by
wake
to
such
sudden
loneliness
,
and
could
not
prevent
his
mind
from
run
upon
odd
tale
of
people
of
undoubted
courage
,
who
,
be
shut
up
by
night
in
vault
or
church
,
or
other
dismal
place
,
have
scale
great
height
to
get
out
,
and
flee
from
silence
as
they
have
never
do
from
danger
.
 
<EOS>
this
bring
to
his
mind
the
moonlight
through
the
window
,
and
bethink
himself
of
it
,
he
grope
his
way
back
up
the
crooked
stair
,
---
but
very
stealthily
,
as
though
he
be
fearful
of
be
overhear
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
astonished
when
he
approach
the
gallery
again
,
to
see
a
light
in
the
building
:
 
still
more
so
,
on
advance
hastily
and
look
round
,
to
observe
no
visible
source
from
which
it
could
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
much
great
yet
be
his
astonishment
at
the
spectacle
which
this
light
reveal
.
   
<EOS>
the
statue
of
the
two
giant
,
Gog
and
Magog
,
each
above
fourteen
foot
in
height
,
those
which
succeed
to
still
old
and
more
barbarous
figure
,
after
the
Great
Fire
of
London
,
and
which
stand
in
the
Guildhall
to
this
day
,
be
endow
with
life
and
motion
.
<EOS>
these
guardian
genii
of
the
City
have
quit
their
pedestal
,
and
recline
in
easy
attitude
in
the
great
stained
glass
window
.
<EOS>
between
them
be
an
ancient
cask
,
which
seem
to
be
full
of
wine
;
for
the
young
Giant
,
clap
his
huge
hand
upon
it
,
and
throw
up
his
mighty
leg
,
burst
into
an
exulting
laugh
,
which
reverberate
through
the
hall
like
thunder
.
   
<EOS>
Joe
Toddyhigh
instinctively
stoop
down
,
and
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
feel
his
hair
stand
on
end
,
his
knee
knock
together
,
and
a
cold
damp
break
out
upon
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
at
that
minute
curiosity
prevail
over
every
other
feeling
,
and
somewhat
reassure
by
the
good
-
humour
of
the
Giants
and
their
apparent
unconsciousness
of
his
presence
,
he
crouch
in
a
corner
of
the
gallery
,
in
as
small
a
space
as
he
could
,
and
,
peep
between
the
rail
,
observe
them
closely
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
the
eld
Giant
,
who
have
a
flow
gray
beard
,
raise
his
thoughtful
eye
to
his
companion
's
face
,
and
in
a
grave
and
solemn
voice
address
him
thus
:
    
<EOS>
First
Night
of
the
giant
chronicle
 
turn
towards
his
companion
the
eld
Giant
utter
these
word
in
a
grave
,
majestic
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
Magog
,
do
boisterous
mirth
beseem
the
Giant
Warder
of
this
ancient
city
?
 
<EOS>
be
this
become
demeanour
for
a
watchful
spirit
over
whose
bodiless
head
so
many
year
have
roll
,
so
many
change
sweep
like
empty
air
---
in
whose
impalpable
nostril
the
scent
of
blood
and
crime
,
pestilence
,
cruelty
,
and
horror
,
have
be
familiar
as
breath
to
mortal
---
in
whose
sight
Time
have
gather
in
the
harvest
of
century
,
and
garner
so
many
crop
of
human
pride
,
affection
,
hope
,
and
sorrow
?
 
<EOS>
bethink
you
of
our
compact
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
wane
;
feasting
,
revelry
,
and
music
have
encroach
upon
our
usual
hour
of
solitude
,
and
morning
will
be
here
apace
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
we
be
stricken
mute
again
,
bethink
you
of
our
compact
.
"
   
<EOS>
pronounce
these
latter
word
with
more
of
impatience
than
quite
accord
with
his
apparent
age
and
gravity
,
the
Giant
raise
a
long
pole
(
which
he
still
bear
in
his
hand
)
and
tap
his
brother
Giant
rather
smartly
on
the
head
;
indeed
,
the
blow
be
so
smartly
administer
,
that
the
latter
quickly
withdraw
his
lip
from
the
cask
,
to
which
they
have
be
apply
,
and
,
catch
up
his
shield
and
halberd
,
assume
an
attitude
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
His
irritation
be
but
momentary
,
for
he
lay
these
weapon
aside
as
hastily
as
he
have
assume
them
,
and
say
as
he
do
so
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Gog
,
old
friend
,
that
when
we
animate
these
shape
which
the
Londoners
of
old
assign
(
and
not
unworthily
)
to
the
guardian
genii
of
their
city
,
we
be
susceptible
of
some
of
the
sensation
which
belong
to
human
kind
.
 
<EOS>
thus
when
I
taste
wine
,
I
feel
blow
;
when
I
relish
the
one
,
I
disrelish
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
Gog
,
the
more
especially
as
your
arm
be
none
of
the
light
,
keep
your
good
staff
by
your
side

else
we
may
chance
to
differ

peace
be

us

<EOS>
"
amen

"
say
the
other
,
lean
his
staff
in
the
window
-
corner
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
laugh
just
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
to
think
,
"
reply
the
Giant
Magog
,
lay
his
hand
upon
the
cask
,
"
of
him
who
own
this
wine
,
and
keep
it
in
a
cellar
hoard

light
of
day

for
thirty
year

"

it

he

<EOS>
He
be
twoscore
and
ten
year
old
when
he
bury
it
beneath
his
house
,
and
yet
never
think
that
he
may
be
scarcely
"
fit

when
the
wine
become
so

<EOS>
I
wonder
it
never
occur
to
him
to
make
himself
unfit

be
eat

there
be
very
little
of

mournfully

his

I
see
you
be
impatient

look

<EOS>
through
the
eastern
window

place
opposite
to
us

that
the
first
beam
of
the
rise
sun
may
every
morning
gild
our

face

the
moon

ray
fall
upon
the
pavement
in
a
stream
of
light
that
to
my
fancy
sink
through

cold
stone

gush
into
the
old
crypt

the
night
be
scarcely
past
its
noon

our
great
charge
be
sleep
heavily
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
cease
to
speak
,
and
look
upward
at
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
their
large
,
black
,
rolling
eye
fill
Joe
Toddyhigh
with
such
horror
that
he
could
scarcely
draw
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
still
they
take
no
note
of
him
,
and
appear
to
believe
themselves
quite
alone

<EOS>
"
Our
compact

say
Magog
after
a
pause
,
"
be
,
if
I
understand
it
,
that

instead
of
watch
here
in
silence
through

dreary
night

entertain
each
other
with
story
of
our
past

with
tale
of
the

"
   
<EOS>
the
other
Giant
appear
to
be
entirely
of
this
opinion
,
for
during
the
foregoing
rhapsody
of
his
fellow
-
sentinel
he
have
be
scratch
his
head
with
an
air
of
comical
uneasiness
,
or
rather
with
an
air
that
would
have
be
very
comical
if
he
have
be
a
dwarf
or
an
ordinary
-
sized
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
wink
too
,
and
though
it
could
not
be
doubt
for
a
moment
that
he
wink
to
himself
,
still
he
certainly
cock
his
enormous
eye
towards
the
gallery
where
the
listener
be
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
all
,
for
he
gape
;
and
when
he
gape
,
Joe
be
horribly
remind
of
the
popular
prejudice
on
the
subject
of
giant
,
and
of
their
fable
power
of
smell
out
Englishmen
,
however
closely
conceal
.
   
<EOS>
His
alarm
be
such
that
he
nearly
swoon
,
and
it
be
some
little
time
before
his
power
of
sight
or
hearing
be
restore
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
recover
he
find
that
the
eld
Giant
be
press
the
young
to
commence
the
chronicle
,
and
that
the
latter
be
endeavour
to
excuse
himself
on
the
ground
that
the
night
be
far
spend
,
and
it
would
be
well
to
wait
until
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
well
assure
by
this
that
he
be
certainly
about
to
begin
directly
,
the
listener
collect
his
faculty
by
a
great
effort
,
and
distinctly
hear
Magog
express
himself
to
the
follow
effect
:
   
<EOS>
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
in
the
reign
of
Queen
Elizabeth
of
glorious
memory
(
albeit
her
golden
day
be
sadly
rust
with
blood
)
,
there
live
in
the
city
of
London
a
bold
young
'
prentice
who
love
his
master
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
within
the
wall
a
great
many
'
prentice
in
this
condition
,
but
I
speak
of
only
one
,
and
his
name
be
Hugh
Graham
.
   
<EOS>
this
Hugh
be
apprentice
to
an
honest
Bowyer
who
dwell
in
the
ward
of
Cheype
,
and
be
rumour
to
possess
great
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
Rumour
be
quite
as
infallible
in
those
day
as
at
the
present
time
,
but
it
happen
then
as
now
to
be
sometimes
right
by
accident
.
 
<EOS>
It
stumble
upon
the
truth
when
it
give
the
old
Bowyer
a
mint
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
His
trade
have
be
a
profitable
one
in
the
time
of
King
Henry
the
Eighth
,
who
encourage
English
archery
to
the
utmost
,
and
he
have
be
prudent
and
discreet
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
come
to
pass
that
Mistress
Alice
,
his
only
daughter
,
be
the
rich
heiress
in
all
his
wealthy
ward
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Hugh
have
often
maintain
with
staff
and
cudgel
that
she
be
the
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
to
do
him
justice
,
I
believe
she
be
.
   
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
gain
the
heart
of
pretty
Mistress
Alice
by
knock
this
conviction
into
stubborn
people
's
head
,
Hugh
would
have
have
no
cause
to
fear
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
the
Bowyer
's
daughter
smile
in
secret
to
hear
of
his
doughty
deed
for
her
sake
,
and
though
her
little
waiting
-
woman
report
all
her
smile
(
and
many
more
)
to
Hugh
,
and
though
he
be
at
a
vast
expense
in
kiss
and
small
coin
to
recompense
her
fidelity
,
he
make
no
progress
in
his
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
durst
not
whisper
it
to
Mistress
Alice
<EOS>
save
on
sure
encouragement
,
and
that
she
never
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
glance
of
her
dark
eye
as
she
sit
at
the
door
on
a
summer
's
evening
after
prayer
-
time
,
while
he
and
the
neighbouring
'
prentice
exercise
themselves
in
the
street
with
blunted
sword
and
buckler
,
would
fire
Hugh
's
blood
so
that
none
could
stand
before
him
;
but
then
she
glance
at
other
quite
as
kindly
as
on
him
,
and
where
be
the
use
of
crack
crown
if
Mistress
Alice
smile
upon
the
crack
as
well
as
on
the
cracker
?
   
<EOS>
still
Hugh
go
on
,
and
love
her
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
her
all
day
,
and
dream
of
her
all
night
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
treasure
up
her
every
word
and
gesture
,
and
have
a
palpitation
of
the
heart
whenever
he
hear
her
footstep
on
the
stair
or
her
voice
in
an
adjoining
room
.
 
<EOS>
to
him
,
the
old
Bowyer
's
house
be
haunt
by
an
angel
;
there
be
enchantment
in
the
air
and
space
in
which
she
move
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
no
miracle
to
Hugh
if
flower
have
spring
from
the
rush
-
strew
floor
beneath
the
tread
of
lovely
Mistress
Alice
.
   
<EOS>
never
do
'
prentice
long
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
eye
of
his
lady
-
love
so
ardently
as
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
picture
to
himself
the
house
take
fire
by
night
,
and
he
,
when
all
draw
back
in
fear
,
rush
through
flame
and
smoke
,
and
bear
her
from
the
ruin
in
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
he
think
of
a
rise
of
fierce
rebel
,
an
attack
upon
the
city
,
a
strong
assault
upon
the
Bowyer
's
house
in
particular
,
and
he
fall
on
the
threshold
pierce
with
numberless
wound
in
defence
of
Mistress
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
could
only
enact
some
prodigy
of
valour
,
do
some
wonderful
deed
,
and
let
her
know
that
she
have
inspire
it
<EOS>
,
he
think
he
could
die
contented
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
the
Bowyer
and
his
daughter
would
go
out
to
supper
with
a
worthy
citizen
at
the
fashionable
hour
of
six
o'clock
,
and
on
such
occasion
Hugh
,
wear
his
blue
'
prentice
cloak
as
gallantly
as
'
prentice
may
,
would
attend
with
a
lantern
and
his
trusty
club
to
escort
them
home
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
bright
moment
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
to
hold
the
light
while
Mistress
Alice
pick
her
step
,
to
touch
her
hand
as
he
help
her
over
broken
way
,
to
have
her
lean
on
his
arm
,
---
it
sometimes
even
come
to
that
,
---
this
be
happiness
indeed
!
   
<EOS>
when
the
night
be
fair
,
Hugh
follow
in
the
rear
,
his
eye
rivet
on
the
graceful
figure
of
the
Bowyer
's
daughter
as
she
and
the
old
man
move
on
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
thread
the
narrow
wind
street
of
the
city
,
now
pass
beneath
the
overhang
gable
of
old
wooden
house
<EOS>
whence
creaking
sign
project
into
the
street
,
and
now
emerge
from
some
dark
and
frown
gateway
into
the
clear
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
time
,
or
when
the
shout
of
straggle
brawler
meet
her
ear
,
the
Bowyer
's
daughter
would
look
timidly
back
at
Hugh
,
beseech
him
to
draw
nearer
;
and
then
how
he
grasp
his
club
and
long
to
do
battle
with
a
dozen
ruffler
,
for
the
love
of
Mistress
Alice
!
   
<EOS>
the
old
Bowyer
be
in
the
habit
of
lend
money
on
interest
to
the
gallant
of
the
Court
,
and
thus
it
happen
that
many
a
richly-
dress
gentleman
dismount
at
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
More
waving
plume
and
gallant
steed
,
indeed
,
be
see
at
the
Bowyer
's
house
,
and
more
embroidered
silk
and
velvet
sparkle
in
his
dark
shop
and
dark
private
closet
,
than
at
any
merchant
in
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
in
those
time
no
less
than
in
the
present
it
would
seem
that
the
richest
-
look
cavalier
often
want
money
the
most
.
   
<EOS>
of
these
glitter
client
there
be
one
who
always
come
alone
.
<EOS>
He
be
nobly
mount
,
and
,
have
no
attendant
,
give
his
horse
in
charge
to
Hugh
while
he
and
the
Bowyer
be
closet
within
.
 
<EOS>
once
as
he
spring
into
the
saddle
Mistress
Alice
be
seat
at
an
upper
window
,
and
before
she
could
withdraw
he
have
doff
his
jewelled
cap
and
kiss
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
watch
him
caracole
down
the
street
,
and
burn
with
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
much
deep
be
the
glow
that
redden
in
his
cheek
<EOS>
when
,
raise
his
eye
to
the
casement
,
he
see
that
Alice
watch
the
stranger
too
!
   
<EOS>
He
come
again
and
often
,
each
time
array
more
gaily
than
before
,
and
still
the
little
casement
show
him
Mistress
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
one
heavy
day
,
she
flee
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
cost
her
a
hard
struggle
,
for
all
her
old
father
's
gift
be
strew
about
her
chamber
as
if
she
have
part
from
them
one
by
one
,
and
know
that
the
time
must
come
when
these
token
of
his
love
would
wring
her
heart
,
---
yet
she
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
She
leave
a
letter
command
her
poor
father
to
the
care
of
Hugh
,
and
wish
he
may
be
happy
than
ever
he
could
have
be
with
her
,
for
he
deserve
the
love
of
a
well
and
a
purer
heart
than
she
have
to
bestow
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
's
forgiveness
(
she
say
)
<EOS>
she
have
no
power
to
ask
,
but
she
pray
God
to
bless
him
,
---
and
so
end
with
a
blot
upon
the
paper
where
her
tear
have
fall
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
the
old
man
's
wrath
be
kindle
,
and
he
carry
his
wrong
to
the
Queen
's
throne
itself
;
but
there
be
no
redress
he
learn
at
Court
,
for
his
daughter
have
be
convey
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
this
afterwards
appear
to
be
the
truth
,
as
there
come
from
France
,
after
an
interval
of
several
year
,
a
letter
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
write
in
tremble
character
,
and
almost
illegible
.
 
<EOS>
little
could
be
make
out
save
that
she
often
think
of
home
and
her
old
dear
pleasant
room
,
---
and
that
she
have
dreamt
<EOS>
her
father
be
dead
and
have
not
bless
her
,
---
and
that
her
heart
be
break
.
   
<EOS>
the
poor
old
Bowyer
linger
on
,
never
suffer
Hugh
to
quit
his
sight
,
for
he
know
now
that
he
have
love
his
daughter
,
and
that
be
the
only
link
that
bind
him
to
earth
.
 
<EOS>
It
break
at
length
and
he
die
,
---
bequeath
his
old
'
prentice
his
trade
and
all
his
wealth
,
and
solemnly
charge
him
with
his
last
breath
to
revenge
his
child
if
ever
he
who
have
work
her
misery
<EOS>
cross
his
path
in
life
again
.
   
<EOS>
from
the
time
of
Alice
's
flight
,
the
tilting
-
ground
,
the
field
,
the
fence
-
school
,
the
summer
-
evening
sport
,
know
Hugh
no
more
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
be
dead
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
to
great
eminence
and
repute
among
the
citizen
,
but
be
seldom
see
to
smile
,
and
never
mingle
in
their
revelry
or
rejoicing
.
 
<EOS>
Brave
,
humane
,
and
generous
<EOS>
,
he
be
beloved
by
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pity
too
by
those
who
know
his
story
,
and
these
be
so
many
that
when
he
walk
along
the
street
alone
at
dusk
,
even
the
rude
common
people
doff
their
cap
and
mingle
a
rough
air
of
sympathy
with
their
respect
.
   
<EOS>
one
night
in
May
---
it
be
her
birthnight
,
and
twenty
year
since
she
have
leave
her
home
<EOS>
---
Hugh
Graham
sit
in
the
room
she
have
hallow
in
his
boyish
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
now
a
gray
-
haired
man
,
though
still
in
the
prime
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
old
thought
have
bear
him
company
for
many
hour
,
and
the
chamber
have
gradually
grow
quite
dark
,
when
he
be
rouse
by
a
low
knocking
at
the
outer
door
.
   
<EOS>
He
hasten
down
,
and
open
it
see
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
he
have
seize
upon
the
way
,
a
female
figure
crouching
in
the
portal
.
 
<EOS>
It
hurry
swiftly
past
him
and
glide
up
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
for
pursuer
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
none
in
sight
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
one
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
inclined
to
think
it
a
vision
of
his
own
brain
,
when
suddenly
a
vague
suspicion
of
the
truth
flash
upon
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
bar
the
door
,
and
hasten
wildly
back
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
there
she
be
,
---
there
,
in
the
chamber
he
have
quit
,
---
there
in
her
old
innocent
,
happy
home
,
so
change
that
none
<EOS>
but
he
could
trace
one
gleam
of
what
she
have
be
,
---
there
upon
her
knee
,
---
<EOS>
with
her
hand
clasped
in
agony
and
shame
before
her
burn
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
God
,
my
God
!
"
she
cry
,
"
now
strike
me
dead
!
 
<EOS>
though
I
have
bring
death
and
shame
and
sorrow
on
this
roof
,
o
,
let
me
die
at
home
in
mercy
!
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
tear
upon
her
face
then
,
but
she
tremble
and
glance
round
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
everything
be
in
its
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
Her
bed
look
as
if
she
have
rise
from
it
but
<EOS>
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
these
familiar
object
,
mark
the
dear
remembrance
in
which
she
have
be
hold
,
and
the
blight
she
have
bring
upon
herself
,
be
more
than
the
woman
's
well
nature
that
have
carry
her
there
could
bear
.
 
<EOS>
She
weep
and
fall
upon
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
a
rumour
be
spread
about
,
in
a
few
day
'
time
,
that
the
Bowyer
's
cruel
daughter
have
come
home
,
and
that
Master
Graham
have
give
her
lodging
in
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rumour
too
that
he
have
resign
her
fortune
,
in
order
that
she
may
bestow
it
in
act
of
charity
,
and
that
he
have
vow
to
guard
her
in
her
solitude
,
but
that
they
be
never
to
see
each
other
more
.
 
<EOS>
these
rumour
greatly
incense
all
virtuous
wife
and
daughter
in
the
ward
,
especially
when
they
appear
to
receive
some
corroboration
from
the
circumstance
of
Master
Graham
take
up
his
abode
in
another
tenement
hard
by
.
 
<EOS>
the
estimation
in
which
he
be
hold
,
however
,
forbid
any
questioning
on
the
subject
;
and
as
the
Bowyer
's
house
be
close
shut
up
,
and
nobody
come
forth
when
public
show
and
festivity
be
in
progress
,
or
to
flaunt
in
the
public
walk
,
or
to
buy
new
fashion
at
the
mercer
'
booth
,
all
the
well

conduct
female
agree
among
themselves
that
there
could
be
no
woman
there
.
   
<EOS>
these
report
have
scarcely
die
away
when
the
wonder
of
every
good
citizen
,
male
and
female
,
be
utterly
absorb
and
swallow
up
by
a
Royal
Proclamation
,
in
which
her
Majesty
,
strongly

the
practice
of

preposterous

(
as

a
bullying

to
bloodshed
and

disorder
)
,
command

on
a
particular

,
that

though
it
be

three

<EOS>
Royal
Proclamations
usually
take
their
course
,
let
the
public
wonder
never
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
on
the

day
two
citizen

high
repute

their
station
at
each

gate
,

,
and
take
custody
of
all
such
rebel

if
any

as

and
a

bear
the
standard
measure
and
instrument
for

all

to
the

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
a
pretty
numerous
company

together
at
this
spot
,
for
,
besides
the
officer
in
attendance
to

the
proclamation
,
there
be
a
motley
crowd
of
looker
-
on
of
various
degree
,
who
raise
from
time
to
time
such
shout
and
cry
as
the
circumstance
call
forth
.
 
<EOS>
a
spruce
young
courtier
be
the
first
who
approach
:
 
<EOS>
he
unsheathe
a
weapon
of
burnished
steel
that
shone
and
glisten
in
the
sun
,
and
hand
it
with
the
new
air
to
the
officer
,
who
,
find
it
exactly
three
foot
long
,
return
it
with
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
thereupon
the
gallant

his
hat
and
cry
,
"
God
save
the
Queen
!
"
<EOS>
pass
on
amidst
the
plaudit

mob
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
another
---
a
well
courtier
still
---
who
wear
a
blade
but
two
foot
long
,
<EOS>
whereat
the
people
laugh
,
much
to
the
disparagement
of
his
honour
's
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
a
third
,
a
sturdy
old
officer
of
the
army
,
gird
with
a
rapier
at
least
a
foot
and
a
half
beyond
her
Majesty
's
pleasure
;
at
him
they
raise
a
great
shout
,
and
most
of
the
spectator
(
but
especially
those
who
be
armourer
or
cutler
)
laugh
very
heartily
at
the
breakage
which
would
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
disappoint
;
for
the
old
campaigner
,
coolly
unbuckle
his
sword
and
bid
his
servant
carry
it
home
again
,
pass
through
unarmed
,
to
the
great
indignation
of
all
the
beholder
.
 
<EOS>
They
relieve
themselves
in
some
degree
by
hoot
a
tall
blustering
fellow
with
a
prodigious
weapon
,
who
stop
short
on
come
in
sight
of
the
preparation
,
and
after
a
little
consideration
turn
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
this
time
no

although
it
be
high
noon
,
and
all
cavalier
of
any
quality
or

towards
Saint

<EOS>
during
these
proceeding
,
Master
Graham
have
stand
apart
,
strictly
confine
himself
to
the
duty
impose
upon
him
,
and
take
little
heed
of
anything
beyond

<EOS>
He

forward
now
as

richly-
dressed
gentleman
on

,
follow
by
a
single
attendant
,

<EOS>
as

the
crowd
stop

and
bend
forward
with
eager
look
.

the

little
for

that
of

It
be
perhaps
some
consciousness
on

of
these

in

that
infuse
a
more

the

through

that
his
master

its
stream
of
cavalier

together
in

struggle

sword

towards
the
spot

<EOS>
with
equal
impetuosity

and
stimulate
each

by
loud
cry

the
citizen

take
up
the
quarrel
on
their
side

and
encircle
Master
Graham
a
hundred
deep
,
force
him
from
the
gate

in

he
wave
the
broken
sword
above
his
head

cry
that
he
would
die
on
London
's
threshold
for
their
sacred
home

<EOS>
They
bear
him
on

the
clash
of
sword

roar
of

the
dust

heat

the
trampling
under

of
man

the
distract
look

shriek
of
woman
at

those

desperately

to
take
refuge
in

until
the

either
from

in

in
a
voice
that
at

itself
hear

confront
them
as

"

for
a

they

at

at
that

in

he
fall
dead

a

after

those

involuntarily
at

his

It
be
empty

<EOS>
the
cask
of
wine
be
go

he
could
dimly
make
out
that
the
two
great
figure
stand
mute
and
motionless
upon
their
pedestal
.
   
<EOS>
after
rub
his

for
full
half
an
hour

during

yield
to
the

vestige
of

<EOS>
steal
gently
down
the
little
stair

and
assume
the
air
of
some
early
lounger
who
have
drop
in
from

street

he
walk
up

<EOS>
there
could
be
no

about
the
feature

;
he
recollect
the
exact
expression
they
have
wear
at
different
passage
of
their
conversation
,
and
recognise
in
every
line
and
lineament
the
Giants
of
the
night

<EOS>
assure
that
it
be
no
vision

but
that
he
have
hear

with
his

he
walk
forth
,
determine
at
all
hazard
to
conceal
himself
in
the
Guildhall
again
that
evening

He
further
resolve
to
sleep
all
day
,
so
that
he
may
be
very
wakeful
and
vigilant
,
and
above
all
that
he
may
take
notice
of
the
figure
at
the
precise
moment
of
their
become

scarcely
less
separated
from
his
old
world
than
they
,
be
for
ever
linger
upon
past
emotion
and
bygone
time
,
and
hovering
,
the
ghost
of
his
former
self
,
about
the
place
and
people
that
warm
his
heart
of
old
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
at
this
quiet
hour
I
haunt
the
house
where
I
be
bear
,
the
room
I
use
to
tread
,
the
scene
of
my
infancy
,
my
boyhood
,
and
my
youth
;
it
be
thus
that
I
prowl
around
my
bury
treasure
(
though
not
of
gold
or
silver
)
,
and
mourn
my
loss
;
it
be
thus
that
I
revisit
the
ashe
of
extinguished
fire
,
and
take
my
silent
stand
at
old
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
if
my
spirit
should
ever
glide
back
to
this
chamber
when
my
body
be
mingle
with
the
dust
,
it
will
but
follow
the
course
it
often
take
in
the
old
man
's
lifetime
,
and
add
but
one
more
change
to
the
subject
of
its
contemplation
.
   
<EOS>
in
all
my
idle
speculation
I
be
greatly
assist
by
various
legend
connect
with
my
venerable
house
,
which
be
current
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
be
so
numerous
that
there
be
scarce
a
cupboard
or
corner
that
have
not
some
dismal
story
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
first
entertain
thought
of
become
its
tenant
,
I
be
assure
that
it
be
haunt
from
roof
to
cellar
,
and
I
believe
that
the
bad
opinion
in
which
my
neighbour
once
hold
me
,
have
its
rise
in
my
not
be
tear
to
piece
,
or
at
least
distract
with
terror
,
on
the
night
I
take
possession
;
in
either
of
which
case
I
should
doubtless
have
arrive
by
a
short
cut
at
the
very
summit
of
popularity
.
   
<EOS>
but
tradition
and
rumour
all
take
into
account
,
who
so
abet
me
in
every
fancy
and
chime
with
my
every
thought
,
as
my
dear
deaf
friend
?
<EOS>
and
how
often
have
I
cause
to
bless
the
day
that
bring
us
two
together
!
 
<EOS>
of
all
day
in
the
year
I
rejoice
to
think
that
it
should
have
be
Christmas
Day
,
with
which
from
childhood
we
associate
something
friendly
,
hearty
,
and
sincere
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
walk
out
to
cheer
myself
with
the
happiness
of
other
,
and
,
in
the
little
token
of
festivity
and
rejoicing
,
of
which
the
street
and
house
present
so
many
upon
that
day
,
have
lose
some
hour
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
stop
to
look
at
a
merry
party
hurrying
through
the
snow
on
foot
to
their
place
of
meeting
,
and
now
turn
back
to
see
a
whole
coachful
of
child
safely
deposit
at
the
welcome
house
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
,
I
admire
how
carefully
the
work
man
carry
the
baby
in
its
gaudy
hat
and
feather
,
and
how
his
wife
,
trudge
patiently
on
behind
,
forget
even
her
care
of
her
gay
clothe
,
in
exchange
greeting
with
the
child
as
it
crow
and
laugh
over
the
father
's
shoulder
;
at
another
,
I
please
myself
with
some
pass
scene
of
gallantry
or
courtship
,
and
be
glad
to
believe
that
for
a
season
half
the
world
of
poverty
be
gay
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
day
close
in
,
I
still
ramble
through
the
street
,
feel
a
companionship
in
the
bright
fire
that
cast
their
warm
reflection
on
the
window
as
I
pass
,
and
lose
all
sense
of
my
own
loneliness
in
imagine
the
sociality
and
kind
-
fellowship
that
everywhere
prevail
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
happen
to
stop
before
a
Tavern
,
and
,
encounter
a
Bill
of
Fare
in
the
window
<EOS>
,
it
all
at
once
bring
it
into
my
head
to
wonder
what
kind
of
people
dine
alone
in
tavern
upon
Christmas
Day
.
   
<EOS>
solitary
man
be
accustomed
,
I
suppose
,
unconsciously
to
look
upon
solitude
as
their
own
peculiar
property
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sit
alone
in
my
room
on
many
,
many
anniversary
of
this
great
holiday
,
and
have
never
regard
it
<EOS>
but
as
one
of
universal
assemblage
and
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
I
have
except
,
and
with
an
ache
heart
,
a
crowd
of
prisoner
and
beggar
;
but
these
be
not
the
man
for
whom
the
tavern
door
be
open
.
 
<EOS>
have
they
any
customer
,
or
be
it
a
mere
form
?
<EOS>
---
a
form
,
no
doubt
.
   
<EOS>
try
to
feel
quite
sure
of
this
,
I
walk
away
;
but
before
I
have
go
many
pace
,
I
stop
and
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
provoking
air
of
business
in
the
lamp
above
the
door
which
I
could
not
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
afraid
there
may
be
many
customer
---
young
man
,
perhaps
,
struggle
with
the
world
,
utter
stranger
in
this
great
place
,
whose
friend
live
at
a
long
distance
off
,
and
whose
mean
be
too
slender
to
enable
them
to
make
the
journey
.
<EOS>
the
supposition
give
rise
to
so
many
distress
little
picture
,
that
in
preference
to
carry
them
home
with
me
,
I
determine
to
encounter
the
reality
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
turn
and
walk
in
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
at
once
glad
and
sorry
to
find
that
there
be
only
one
person
in
the
dining
-
room
;
glad
to
know
that
there
be
not
more
,
and
sorry
that
he
should
be
there
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
look
so
old
as
I
,
but
like
me
he
be
advanced
in
life
,
and
his
hair
be
nearly
white
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
make
more
noise
in
enter
and
seat
myself
than
be
quite
necessary
,
with
the
view
of
attract
his
attention
and
salute
him
in
the
good
old
form
of
that
time
of
year
,
he
do
not
raise
his
head
,
but
sit
with
it
rest
on
his
hand
,
muse
over
his
half
-
finished
meal
.
   
<EOS>
I
call
for
something
which
would
give
me
an
excuse
for
remain
in
the
room
<EOS>
(
I
have
dine
early
,
as
my
housekeeper
be
engage
at
night
to
partake
of
some
friend
's
good
cheer
)
,
and
sit
where
I
could
observe
without
intrude
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
time
he
look
up
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
somebody
have
enter
,
but
could
see
very
little
of
me
,
as
I
sit
in
the
shade
and
he
in
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sad
and
thoughtful
,
and
I
forbore
to
trouble
him
by
speak
.
   
<EOS>
let
me
believe
it
be
something
well
than
curiosity
which
rivet
my
attention
and
impel
me
strongly
towards
this
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
so
patient
and
kind
a
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
should
have
be
surround
by
friend
,
and
yet
here
he
sit
dejected
and
alone
when
all
man
have
their
friend
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
as
often
as
he
rouse
himself
from
his
reverie
he
would
fall
into
it
again
,
and
it
be
plain
that
,
whatever
be
the
subject
of
his
thought
,
they
be
of
a
melancholy
kind
,
and
would
not
be
control
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
not
use
to
solitude
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
that
;
for
I
know
by
myself
that
if
he
have
be
,
his
manner
would
have
be
different
,
and
he
would
have
take
some
slight
interest
in
the
arrival
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
fail
to
mark
that
he
have
no
appetite
;
that
he
try
to
eat
in
vain
;
that
time
after
time
the
plate
be
push
away
,
and
he
relapse
into
his
former
posture
.
   
<EOS>
His
mind
be
wander
among
old
Christmas
day
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
them
spring
up
together
,
not
with
a
long
gap
between
each
,
but
in
unbroken
succession
like
day
of
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
change
to
find
himself
for
the
first
time
<EOS>
(
I
quite
settle
that
it
be
the
first
)
in
an
empty
silent
room
with
no
soul
to
care
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
follow
him
in
imagination
through
crowd
of
pleasant
face
,
and
then
come
back
to
that
dull
place
with
its
bough
of
mistletoe
sickening
in
the
gas
,
and
sprig
of
holly
parch
up
already
by
a
Simoom
of
roast
and
boil
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
waiter
have
go
home
;
and
his
representative
,
a
poor
,
lean
,
hungry
man
,
be
keep
Christmas
in
his
jacket
.
   
<EOS>
I
grow
still
more
interested
in
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
His
dinner
do
,
a
decanter
of
wine
be
place
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
remain
untouched
for
a
long
time
,
but
at
length
with
a
quivering
hand
he
fill
a
glass
and
raise
it
to
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
some
tender
wish
to
which
he
have
be
accustom
to
give
utterance
on
that
day
,
or
some
beloved
name
that
he
have
be
use
to
pledge
,
tremble
upon
them
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
it
down
very
hastily
---
take
it
up
once
more
---
again
put
it
down
---
press
his
hand
upon
his
face
---
yes
---
<EOS>
and
tear
steal
down
his
cheek
<EOS>
,
I
be
certain
.
   
<EOS>
without
pause
to
consider
whether
I
do
right
or
wrong
,
I
step
across
the
room
,
and
sit
down
beside
him
lay
my
hand
gently
on
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
I
say
,
"
forgive
me
if
I
beseech
you
to
take
comfort
and
consolation
from
the
lip
of
an
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
preach
to
you
what
I
have
not
practise
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
be
your
grief
,
be
of
a
good
heart
---
be
of
a
good
heart
,
pray
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
you
speak
earnestly
,
"
he
reply
,
"
and
kindly
I
be
very
sure
,
but
---
"
   
I
nod
my
head
to
show
that
I
understand
what
he
would
say
;
for
I
have
already
gather
,
from
a
certain
fix
expression
in
his
face
,
and
from
the
attention
with
which
he
watch
me
while
I
speak
,
that
his
sense
of
hearing
be
destroy
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
should
be
a
freemasonry
between
us
,
"
say
I
,
point
from
himself
to
me
to
explain
my
meaning
;
"
if
not
in
our
gray
hair
,
at
least
in
our
misfortune
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
I
be
but
a
poor
cripple
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
feel
so
happy
under
my
affliction
since
the
try
moment
of
my
first
become
conscious
of
it
,
as
when
he
take
my
hand
in
his
with
a
smile
that
have
light
my
path
in
life
from
that
day
,
and
we
sit
down
side
by
side
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
beginning
of
my
friendship
with
the
deaf
gentleman
;
and
when
be
ever
the
slight
and
easy
service
of
a
kind
word
in
season
repay
by
such
attachment
and
devotion
as
he
have
show
to
me
!
   
<EOS>
He
produce
a
little
set
of
tablet
and
a
pencil
to
facilitate
our
conversation
,
on
that
our
first
acquaintance
;
and
I
well
remember
how
awkward
and
constrain
I
be
in
write
down
my
share
of
the
dialogue
,
and
how
easily
he
guess
my
meaning
before
I
have
write
half
of
what
I
have
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
in
a
faltering
voice
that
he
have
not
be
accustomed
to
be
alone
on
that
day
---
that
it
have
always
be
a
little
festival
with
him
;
and
see
that
I
glance
at
his
dress
in
the
expectation
that
he
wear
mourn
,
he
add
hastily
that
it
be
not
that
;
if
it
have
be
he
think
he
could
have
bear
it
better
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
time
to
the
present
we
have
never
touch
upon
this
theme
.
 
<EOS>
upon
every
return
of
the
same
day
we
have
be
together
;
and
although
we
make
it
our
annual
custom
to
drink
to
each
other
hand
in
hand
after
dinner
,
and
to
recall
with
affectionate
garrulity
every
circumstance
of
our
first
meeting
,
we
always
avoid
this
one
as
if
by
mutual
consent
.
   
<EOS>
meantime
we
have
go
on
strengthen
in
our
friendship
and
regard
and
form
an
attachment
which
,
I
trust
and
believe
,
will
only
be
interrupt
by
death
,
to
be
renew
in
another
existence
.
 
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
how
we
communicate
as
we
do
;
but
he
have
long
since
cease
to
be
deaf
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
frequently
my
companion
in
my
walk
,
and
even
in
crowded
street
reply
to
my
slight
look
or
gesture
,
as
though
he
could
read
my
thought
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
vast
number
of
object
which
pass
in
rapid
succession
before
our
eye
,
we
frequently
select
the
same
for
some
particular
notice
or
remark
;
and
when
one
of
these
little
coincidence
occur
,
I
can
not
describe
the
pleasure
which
animate
my
friend
,
or
the
beam
countenance
he
will
preserve
for
half
-
an
-
hour
afterwards
at
least
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
thinker
from
live
so
much
within
himself
,
and
,
have
a
lively
imagination
,
have
a
facility
of
conceiving
and
enlarge
upon
odd
idea
,
which
render
him
invaluable
to
our
little
body
,
and
greatly
astonish
our
two
friend
.
 
<EOS>
His
power
in
this
respect
be
much
assist
by
a
large
pipe
,
which
he
assure
us
once
belong
to
a
German
Student
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
it
have
undoubtedly
a
very
ancient
and
mysterious
appearance
,
and
be
of
such
capacity
that
it
take
three
hour
and
a
half
to
smoke
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
my
barber
,
who
be
the
chief
authority
of
a
knot
of
gossip
,
who
congregate
every
evening
at
a
small
tobacconist
's
hard
by
,
have
relate
anecdote
of
this
pipe
and
the
grim
figure
that
be
carve
upon
its
bowl
,
at
which
all
the
smoker
in
the
neighbourhood
have
stand
aghast
;
and
I
know
that
my
housekeeper
,
while
she
hold
it
in
high
veneration
,
have
a
superstitious
feeling
connect
with
it
which
would
render
her
exceedingly
unwilling
to
be
leave
alone
in
its
company
after
dark
.
   
<EOS>
whatever
sorrow
my
dear
friend
have
know
,
and
whatever
grief
may
linger
in
some
secret
corner
of
his
heart
,
he
be
now
a
cheerful
,
placid
,
happy
creature
.
 
<EOS>
Misfortune
can
never
have
fall
upon
such
a
man
but
for
some
good
purpose
;
and
when
I
see
its
trace
in
his
gentle
nature
and
his
earnest
feeling
,
I
be
the
less
disposed
to
murmur
at
such
trial
as
I
may
have
undergo
myself
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
the
pipe
,
I
have
a
theory
of
my
own
;
I
can
not
help
think
that
it
be
in
some
manner
connect
with
the
event
that
bring
us
together
;
for
I
remember
that
it
be
a
long
time
before
he
even
talk
about
it
;
that
when
he
do
,
he
grow
reserve
and
melancholy
;
and
that
it
be
a
long
time
yet
before
he
bring
it
forth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
curiosity
,
however
,
upon
this
subject
;
for
I
know
that
it
promote
his
tranquillity
and
comfort
,
and
I
need
no
other
inducement
to
regard
it
with
my
utmost
favour
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
deaf
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
call
up
his
figure
now
,
clothe
in
sober
gray
,
and
seat
in
the
chimney
-
corner
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
puff
out
the
smoke
from
his
favourite
pipe
,
he
cast
a
look
on
me
brimful
of
cordiality
and
friendship
,
and
say
all
manner
of
kind
and
genial
thing
in
a
cheerful
smile
;
then
he
raise
his
eye
to
my
clock
,
which
be
just
about
to
strike
,
and
,
glance
from
it
to
me
and
back
again
,
seem
to
divide
his
heart
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
for
myself
,
it
be
not
too
much
to
say
that
I
would
gladly
part
with
one
of
my
poor
limb
,
<EOS>
could
he
but
hear
the
old
clock
's
voice
.
   
<EOS>
of
our
two
friend
,
the
first
have
be
all
his
life
one
of
that
easy
,
wayward
,
truant
class
whom
the
world
be
accustomed
to
designate
as
nobody
's
enemy
but
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
breed
to
a
profession
for
which
he
never
qualify
himself
,
and
rear
in
the
expectation
of
a
fortune
he
have
never
inherit
,
he
have
undergo
every
vicissitude
of
which
such
an
existence
be
capable
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
young
brother
,
both
orphan
from
their
childhood
,
be
educate
by
a
wealthy
relative
,
who
teach
them
to
expect
an
equal
division
of
his
property
;
but
too
indolent
to
court
,
and
too
honest
to
flatter
,
the
elder
gradually
lose
ground
in
the
affection
of
a
capricious
old
man
,
and
the
young
,
who
do
not
fail
to
improve
his
opportunity
,
now
triumph
in
the
possession
of
enormous
wealth
.
<EOS>
His
triumph
be
to
hoard
it
in
solitary
wretchedness
,
and
probably
to
feel
with
the
expenditure
of
every
shill
a
great
pang
than
the
loss
of
his
whole
inheritance
ever
cost
his
brother
.
   
<EOS>
Jack
Redburn
---
he
be
Jack
Redburn
at
the
first
little
school
he
go
to
,
where
every
other
child
be
master
and
surname
,
and
he
have
be
Jack
Redburn
<EOS>
all
his
life
,
or
<EOS>
he
would
perhaps
have
be
a
rich
man
by
this
time
---
have
be
an
inmate
of
my
house
these
eight
year
past
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
my
librarian
,
secretary
,
steward
,
and
first
minister
;
director
of
all
my
affair
,
and
inspector
-
general
of
my
household
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
something
of
a
musician
,
something
of
an
author
,
something
of
an
actor
,
something
of
a
painter
,
very
much
of
a
carpenter
,
and
an
extraordinary
gardener
,
have
have
all
his
life
a
wonderful
aptitude
for
learn
everything
that
be
of
no
use
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
remarkably
fond
of
child
,
and
be
the
good
and
kind
nurse
in
sickness
that
ever
draw
the
breath
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
mix
with
every
grade
of
society
,
and
know
the
utmost
distress
;
but
there
never
be
a
less
selfish
,
a
more
tender-
hearte
,
a
more
enthusiastic
,
or
a
more
guileless
man
;
and
I
dare
say
,
if
few
have
do
less
good
,
few
still
have
do
less
harm
in
the
world
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
by
what
chance
Nature
form
such
whimsical
jumble
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
;
<EOS>
but
I
do
know
that
she
send
them
among
us
very
often
,
and
that
the
king
of
the
whole
race
be
Jack
Redburn
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
be
puzzle
to
say
how
old
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
His
health
be
none
of
the
good
,
and
he
wear
a
quantity
of
iron
-
gray
hair
,
which
shade
his
face
and
give
it
rather
a
worn
appearance
;
but
we
consider
him
quite
a
young
fellow
notwithstanding
;
and
if
a
youthful
spirit
,
survive
the
rough
contact
with
the
world
,
confer
upon
its
possessor
any
title
to
be
consider
young
,
then
he
be
a
mere
child
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
interruption
to
his
careless
cheerfulness
be
on
a
wet
Sunday
,
when
he
be
apt
to
be
unusually
religious
and
solemn
,
and
sometimes
of
an
evening
,
when
he
have
be
blow
a
very
slow
tune
on
the
flute
.
 
<EOS>
on
these
last
-
name
occasion
he
be
apt
to
incline
towards
the
mysterious
,
or
the
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
speciman
of
his
power
in
this
mood
,
I
refer
my
reader
to
the
extract
from
the
clock
-
case
which
follow
this
paper
:
 
<EOS>
he
bring
it
to
me
not
long
ago
at
midnight
,
and
inform
me
that
the
main
incident
have
be
suggest
by
a
dream
of
the
night
before
.
   
<EOS>
His
apartment
be
two
cheerful
room
look
towards
the
garden
,
and
one
of
his
great
delight
be
to
arrange
and
rearrange
the
furniture
in
these
chamber
,
and
put
it
in
every
possible
variety
of
position
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
whole
time
he
have
be
here
,
I
do
not
think
he
have
sleep
for
two
night
run
with
the
head
of
his
bed
in
the
same
place
;
and
every
time
he
move
it
,
be
to
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
My
housekeeper
be
at
first
well
-
nigh
distract
by
these
frequent
change
;
but
she
have
become
quite
reconcile
to
them
by
degree
,
and
have
so
fall
in
with
his
humour
,
that
they
often
consult
together
with
great
gravity
upon
the
next
final
alteration
.
<EOS>
whatever
his
arrangement
be
,
however
,
they
be
always
a
pattern
of
neatness
;
and
every
one
of
the
manifold
article
connect
with
his
manifold
occupation
be
to
be
find
in
its
own
particular
place
.
 
<EOS>
until
within
the
last
two
or
three
year
he
be
subject
to
an
occasional
fit
(
which
usually
come
upon
him
in
very
fine
weather
)
,
under
the
influence
of
which
he
would
dress
himself
with
peculiar
care
,
and
,
go
out
under
pretence
of
take
a
walk
,
disappear
for
several
day
together
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
after
the
interval
between
each
outbreak
of
this
disorder
have
gradually
grow
longer
and
longer
,
it
wholly
disappear
;
and
now
he
seldom
stir
abroad
,
except
to
stroll
out
a
little
way
on
a
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
whether
he
yet
mistrust
his
own
constancy
in
this
respect
,
and
be
therefore
afraid
to
wear
a
coat
,
I
know
not
;
but
we
seldom
see
him
in
any
other
upper
garment
than
an
old
spectral
-
look
dressing-
gown
,
with
very
disproportionate
pocket
,
full
of
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
odd
matter
,
which
he
pick
up
wherever
he
can
lay
his
hand
upon
them
.
   
<EOS>
everything
that
be
a
favourite
with
our
friend
be
a
favourite
with
us
;
and
thus
it
happen
that
the
fourth
among
us
be
Mr
Owen
Miles
,
a
most
worthy
gentleman
,
who
have
treat
Jack
with
great
kindness
before
my
deaf
friend
and
I
encounter
him
by
an
accident
,
to
which
I
may
refer
on
some
future
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Miles
be
once
a
very
rich
merchant
;
but
receive
a
severe
shock
in
the
death
of
his
wife
,
he
retire
from
business
,
and
devote
himself
to
a
quiet
,
unostentatious
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
excellent
man
,
of
thoroughly
sterling
character
:
 
not
of
quick
apprehension
,
and
not
without
some
amusing
prejudice
,
which
I
shall
leave
to
their
own
development
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
us
all
in
profound
veneration
;
but
Jack
Redburn
he
esteem
as
a
kind
of
pleasant
wonder
,
that
he
may
venture
to
approach
familiarly
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
,
not
only
that
no
man
ever
live
who
could
do
so
many
thing
as
Jack
,
but
that
no
man
ever
live
who
could
do
anything
so
well
;
and
he
never
call
my
attention
to
any
of
his
ingenious
proceeding
,
but
he
whisper
in
my
ear
,
nudge
me
at
the
same
time
with
his
elbow
:
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
have
only
make
it
his
trade
,
sir
---
if
he
have
only
make
it
his
trade
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
be
inseparable
companion
;
one
would
almost
suppose
that
,
although
Mr
Miles
never
by
any
chance
do
anything
in
the
way
of
assistance
,
Jack
could
do
nothing
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
be
read
,
writing
,
painting
,
carpentering
,
gardening
,
flute
-
playing
,
or
what
not
,
there
be
Mr
Miles
beside
him
,
button
up
to
the
chin
in
his
blue
coat
,
and
look
on
with
a
face
of
incredulous
delight
,
as
though
he
could
not
credit
the
testimony
of
his
own
sense
,
and
have
a
misgiving
that
no
man
could
be
so
clever
but
in
a
dream
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
my
friend
;
I
have
now
introduce
myself
and
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
clock
-
case
a
confession
find
in
a
prison
in
the
time
of
Charles
<EOS>
the
Second
 
<EOS>
I
hold
a
lieutenant
's
commission
in
his
Majesty
's
army
,
and
serve
abroad
in
the
campaign
of
1677
and
1678
.
 
<EOS>
the
treaty
of
Nimeguen
be
conclude
,
I
return
home
,
and
retire
from
the
service
,
withdraw
to
a
small
estate
lie
a
few
mile
east
of
London
,
which
I
have
recently
acquire
in
right
of
my
wife
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
night
I
have
to
live
,
and
I
will
set
down
the
naked
truth
without
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
a
brave
man
,
and
have
always
be
from
my
childhood
of
a
secret
,
sullen
,
distrustful
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
of
myself
as
if
I
have
pass
from
the
world
;
for
while
I
write
this
,
my
grave
be
dig
,
and
my
name
be
write
in
the
black
-
book
of
death
.
   
<EOS>
soon
after
my
return
to
England
,
my
only
brother
be
seize
with
mortal
illness
.
 
<EOS>
this
circumstance
give
me
slight
or
no
pain
;
for
since
we
have
be
man
,
we
have
associate
but
very
little
together
.
<EOS>
He
be
open
-
hearted
and
generous
,
handsome
than
I
,
more
accomplished
,
and
generally
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
seek
my
acquaintance
abroad
or
at
home
,
because
they
be
friend
of
his
,
seldom
attach
themselves
to
me
long
,
and
would
usually
say
,
in
our
first
conversation
,
that
they
be
surprised
to
find
two
brother
so
unlike
in
their
manner
and
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
habit
to
lead
them
on
to
this
avowal
;
for
I
know
what
comparison
they
must
draw
between
us
;
and
have
a
rankling
envy
in
my
heart
,
I
seek
to
justify
it
to
myself
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
marry
two
sister
.
 
<EOS>
this
additional
tie
between
us
,
as
it
may
appear
to
some
,
only
estrange
us
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
know
me
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
struggle
with
any
secret
jealousy
or
gall
when
she
be
present
but
that
woman
know
it
as
well
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
raise
my
eye
at
such
time
<EOS>
but
I
find
her
fix
upon
me
;
I
never
bend
them
on
the
ground
or
look
another
way
<EOS>
but
I
feel
that
she
overlook
me
always
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
inexpressible
relief
to
me
when
we
quarrel
,
and
a
great
relief
still
when
I
hear
abroad
that
she
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
now
as
if
some
strange
and
terrible
foreshadowing
of
what
have
happen
since
must
have
hang
over
us
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
her
;
she
haunt
me
;
her
fixed
and
steady
look
come
back
upon
me
now
,
like
the
memory
of
a
dark
dream
,
and
make
my
blood
run
cold
.
   
<EOS>
She
die
shortly
after
give
birth
to
a
child
---
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
brother
know
that
all
hope
of
his
own
recovery
be
past
,
he
call
my
wife
to
his
bedside
,
and
confide
this
orphan
,
a
child
of
four
year
old
,
to
her
protection
.
 
<EOS>
He
bequeath
to
him
all
the
property
he
have
,
and
will
that
,
in
case
of
his
child
's
death
,
it
should
pass
to
my
wife
,
as
the
only
acknowledgment
he
could
make
her
for
her
care
and
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
exchange
a
few
brotherly
word
with
me
,
deplore
our
long
separation
;
and
be
exhaust
,
fall
into
a
slumber
,
from
which
he
never
awake
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
no
child
;
and
as
there
have
be
a
strong
affection
between
the
sister
,
and
my
wife
have
almost
supply
the
place
of
a
mother
to
this
boy
,
she
love
him
as
if
he
have
be
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
be
ardently
attach
to
her
;
but
he
be
his
mother
's
image
in
face
and
spirit
,
and
always
mistrust
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
fix
the
date
when
the
feeling
first
come
upon
me
;
but
I
soon
begin
to
be
uneasy
when
this
child
be
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
rouse
myself
from
some
moody
train
of
thought
<EOS>
but
I
mark
him
look
at
me
;
not
with
mere
childish
wonder
,
but
with
something
of
the
purpose
and
meaning
that
I
have
so
often
note
in
his
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
effort
of
my
fancy
,
found
on
close
resemblance
of
feature
and
expression
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
look
the
boy
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
fear
me
,
but
seem
by
some
instinct
to
despise
me
while
he
do
so
;
and
even
when
he
draw
back
beneath
my
gaze
---
as
he
would
when
we
be
alone
,
to
get
near
to
the
door
---
he
would
keep
his
bright
eye
upon
me
still
.
   
<EOS>
perhaps
I
hide
the
truth
from
myself
,
but
I
do
not
think
that
,
when
this
begin
,
I
meditate
to
do
him
any
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
think
how
serviceable
his
inheritance
would
be
to
us
,
and
may
have
wish
him
dead
;
but
I
believe
I
have
no
thought
of
compass
his
death
.
<EOS>
neither
do
the
idea
come
upon
me
at
once
,
but
by
very
slow
degree
,
present
itself
at
first
in
dim
shape
at
a
very
great
distance
,
as
man
may
think
of
an
earthquake
or
the
last
day
;
then
draw
nearer
and
nearer
,
and
lose
something
of
its
horror
and
improbability
;
then
come
to
be
part
and
parcel
---
<EOS>
nay
nearly
the
whole
sum
and
substance
---
of
my
daily
thought
,
and
resolve
itself
into
a
question
of
mean
and
safety
;
not
of
do
or
abstaining
from
the
deed
.
   
<EOS>
while
this
be
go
on
within
me
,
I
never
could
bear
that
the
child
should
see
me
look
at
him
,
and
yet
I
be
under
a
fascination
which
make
it
a
kind
of
business
with
me
to
contemplate
his
slight
and
fragile
figure
and
think
how
easily
it
may
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
would
steal
up
-
stair
and
watch
him
as
he
sleep
;
but
usually
I
hover
in
the
garden
near
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
he
learn
his
little
task
;
and
there
,
as
he
sit
upon
a
low
seat
beside
my
wife
,
I
would
peer
at
him
for
hour
together
from
behind
a
tree
;
start
,
like
the
guilty
wretch
I
be
,
at
every
rustling
of
a
leaf
,
and
still
glide
back
to
look
and
start
again
.
   
<EOS>
hard
by
our
cottage
,
but
quite
out
of
sight
,
and
(
if
there
be
any
wind
astir
)
of
hear
too
,
be
a
deep
sheet
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
spend
day
in
shape
with
my
pocket
-
knife
a
rough
model
of
a
boat
,
which
I
finish
at
last
and
drop
in
the
child
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
withdraw
to
a
secret
place
,
which
he
must
pass
if
he
steal
away
alone
to
swim
this
bauble
,
and
lurk
there
for
his
coming
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
neither
that
day
nor
the
next
,
though
I
wait
from
noon
till
nightfall
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
I
have
him
in
my
net
,
<EOS>
for
I
have
hear
him
prattle
of
the
toy
,
and
know
that
in
his
infant
pleasure
he
keep
it
by
his
side
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
no
weariness
or
fatigue
,
but
wait
patiently
,
and
on
the
third
day
he
pass
me
,
run
joyously
along
,
with
his
silken
hair
stream
in
the
wind
,
and
he
singe
---
God
have
mercy
upon
me
!
<EOS>
---
singe
a
merry
ballad
,
---
who
could
hardly
lisp
the
word
.
   
<EOS>
I
steal
down
after
him
,
creep
under
certain
shrub
which
grow
in
that
place
,
and
none
but
devil
know
with
what
terror
<EOS>
I
,
a
strong
,
full
-
grown
man
,
track
the
footstep
of
that
baby
as
he
approach
the
water
's
brink
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
close
upon
him
,
have
sink
upon
my
knee
and
raise
my
hand
to
thrust
him
in
,
when
he
see
my
shadow
in
the
stream
and
turn
him
round
.
   
<EOS>
His
mother
's
ghost
be
look
from
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
burst
forth
from
behind
a
cloud
;
it
shine
in
the
bright
sky
,
the
glisten
earth
,
the
clear
water
,
the
sparkling
drop
of
rain
upon
the
leave
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
eye
in
everything
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
great
universe
of
light
be
there
to
see
the
murder
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
he
say
;
he
come
of
bold
and
manly
blood
,
and
,
child
as
he
be
,
he
do
not
crouch
or
fawn
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
him
cry
that
he
would
try
to
love
me
,
---
<EOS>
not
that
he
do
,
---
<EOS>
and
then
I
see
him
run
back
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
I
see
be
my
own
sword
naked
in
my
hand
,
and
he
lie
at
my
foot
stark
dead
,
---
dabble
here
and
there
with
blood
,
but
otherwise
no
different
from
what
I
have
see
him
in
his
sleep
---
in
the
same
attitude
too
,
with
his
cheek
rest
upon
his
little
hand
.
   
<EOS>
I
take
him
in
my
arm
and
lay
him
---
very
gently
now
that
he
be
dead
---
in
a
thicket
.
 
<EOS>
My
wife
be
from
home
that
day
,
and
would
not
return
until
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
Our
bedroom
window
,
the
only
sleeping
-
room
on
that
side
of
the
house
,
be
but
a
few
foot
from
the
ground
,
and
I
resolve
to
descend
from
it
at
night
and
bury
him
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
thought
that
I
have
fail
in
my
design
,
<EOS>
no
think
that
the
water
would
be
drag
and
nothing
find
,
that
the
money
must
now
lie
waste
,
since
I
must
encourage
the
idea
that
the
child
be
lose
or
steal
.
 
<EOS>
all
my
thought
be
bind
up
and
knot
together
in
the
one
absorb
necessity
of
hide
what
I
have
do
.
   
<EOS>
how
I
feel
when
they
come
to
tell
me
that
the
child
be
miss
,
when
I
order
scout
in
all
direction
,
when
I
gasp
and
tremble
at
every
one
's
approach
,
no
tongue
can
tell
or
mind
of
man
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
I
bury
him
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
part
the
bough
and
look
into
the
dark
thicket
,
there
be
a
glow
-
worm
shine
like
the
visible
spirit
of
God
upon
the
murder
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
glance
down
into
his
grave
when
I
have
place
him
there
,
and
still
it
gleam
upon
his
breast
;
an
eye
of
fire
look
up
to
Heaven
in
supplication
to
the
star
that
watch
me
at
my
work
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
to
meet
my
wife
,
and
break
the
news
,
and
give
her
hope
that
the
child
would
soon
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
I
do
,
---
with
some
appearance
,
I
suppose
,
of
be
sincere
,
for
I
be
the
object
of
no
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
,
I
sit
at
the
bedroom
window
all
day
long
,
and
watch
the
spot
where
the
dreadful
secret
lie
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
a
piece
of
ground
which
have
be
dig
up
to
be
newly
turf
,
and
which
I
have
choose
on
that
account
,
as
the
trace
of
my
spade
be
less
likely
to
attract
attention
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
who
lay
down
the
grass
must
have
think
me
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
to
them
continually
to
expedite
their
work
,
run
out
and
work
beside
them
,
trod
down
the
earth
with
my
foot
,
and
hurry
them
with
frantic
eagerness
.
<EOS>
They
have
finish
their
task
before
night
,
and
then
I
think
myself
comparatively
safe
.
   
<EOS>
I
sleep
,
---
not
as
man
do
who
awake
refreshed
and
cheerful
,
but
I
do
sleep
,
pass
from
vague
and
shadowy
dream
of
be
hunt
down
,
to
vision
of
the
plot
of
grass
,
through
which
now
a
hand
,
and
now
a
foot
,
and
now
the
head
itself
be
start
out
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
point
I
always
wake
and
steal
to
the
window
,
to
make
sure
that
it
be
not
really
so
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
I
creep
to
bed
again
;
and
thus
I
spend
the
night
in
fit
and
start
,
get
up
and
lie
down
full
twenty
time
,
and
dream
the
same
dream
over
and
over
again
,
---
which
be
far
bad
than
lie
awake
,
<EOS>
for
every
dream
have
a
whole
night
's
suffering
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
once
I
think
the
child
be
alive
,
and
that
I
have
never
try
to
kill
him
.
 
<EOS>
to
wake
from
that
dream
be
the
most
dreadful
agony
of
all
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
sit
at
the
window
again
,
never
once
take
my
eye
from
the
place
,
which
,
although
it
be
cover
by
the
grass
,
be
as
plain
to
me
---
its
shape
,
its
size
,
its
depth
,
its
jagged
side
,
and
all
---
as
if
it
have
be
open
to
the
light
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
servant
walk
across
it
,
I
feel
as
if
he
must
sink
in
;
when
he
have
pass
,
I
look
to
see
that
his
foot
have
not
wear
the
edge
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
bird
light
there
,
I
be
in
terror
l
by
some
tremendous
interposition
it
should
be
instrumental
in
the
discovery
;
if
a
breath
of
air
sigh
across
it
,
to
me
it
whisper
murder
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
sight
or
a
sound
---
<EOS>
how
ordinary
,
mean
,
or
unimportant
soever
---
but
be
fraught
with
fear
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
this
state
of
ceaseless
watch
I
spend
three
day
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
fourth
there
come
to
the
gate
one
who
have
serve
with
me
abroad
,
accompany
by
a
brother
officer
of
his
whom
I
have
never
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
could
not
bear
to
be
out
of
sight
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
summer
evening
,
and
I
bade
my
people
take
a
table
and
a
flask
of
wine
into
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
sit
down
with
my
chair
upon
the
grave
,
and
be
assure
that
nobody
could
disturb
it
now
without
my
knowledge
,
try
to
drink
and
talk
.
   
<EOS>
They
hope
that
my
wife
be
well
,
---
that
she
be
not
oblige
to
keep
her
chamber
,
---
that
they
have
not
frighten
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
but
tell
them
with
a
falter
tongue
about
the
child
?
<EOS>
the
officer
whom
I
do
not
know
be
a
down
-
looking
man
,
and
keep
his
eye
upon
the
ground
while
I
be
speak
.
 
<EOS>
even
that
terrify
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
divest
myself
of
the
idea
that
he
see
something
there
which
cause
him
to
suspect
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
hurriedly
if
he
suppose
that
---
and
stop
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
the
child
have
be
murder
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
look
mildly
at
me
:
 
"
<EOS>
o
no
!
<EOS>
what
could
a
man
gain
by
murder
a
poor
child
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
tell
him
what
a
man
gain
by
such
a
deed
,
no
one
better
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
hold
my
peace
and
shiver
as
with
an
ague
.
   
<EOS>
mistake
my
emotion
,
they
be
endeavour
to
cheer
me
with
the
hope
that
the
boy
would
certainly
be
find
,
---
great
cheer
that
be
for
me
!
<EOS>
---
when
we
hear
a
low
deep
howl
,
and
presently
there
spring
over
the
wall
two
great
dog
,
who
,
bound
into
the
garden
,
repeat
the
baying
sound
we
have
hear
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
bloodhound
!
"
cry
my
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
what
need
to
tell
me
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
one
of
that
kind
in
all
my
life
,
but
I
know
what
they
be
and
for
what
purpose
they
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
grasp
the
elbow
of
my
chair
,
and
neither
speak
nor
move
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
be
of
the
genuine
breed
,
"
say
the
man
whom
I
have
know
abroad
,
"
and
be
out
for
exercise
have
no
doubt
escape
from
their
keeper
.
"
   
<EOS>
both
he
and
his
friend
turn
to
look
at
the
dog
,
who
with
their
nose
to
the
ground
move
restlessly
about
,
run
to
and
fro
,
and
up
and
down
,
and
across
,
and
round
in
circle
,
career
about
like
wild
thing
,
and
all
this
time
take
no
notice
of
us
,
but
ever
and
again
repeat
the
yell
we
have
hear
already
,
then
drop
their
nose
to
the
ground
again
and
track
earnestly
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
They
now
begin
to
snuff
the
earth
more
eagerly
than
they
have
do
yet
,
and
although
they
be
still
very
restless
,
no
longer
beat
about
in
such
wide
circuit
,
but
keep
near
to
one
spot
,
and
constantly
diminish
the
distance
between
themselves
and
me
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
they
come
up
close
to
the
great
chair
on
which
I
sit
,
and
raise
their
frightful
howl
once
more
,
try
to
tear
away
the
wooden
rail
that
keep
them
from
the
ground
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
how
I
look
,
in
the
face
of
the
two
who
be
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
scent
some
prey
,
"
say
they
,
both
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
scent
no
prey
!
"
<EOS>
cry
I.
   
<EOS>
"
in
Heaven
's
name
,
move
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
one
I
know
,
very
earnestly
,
"
or
you
will
be
tear
to
piece
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
let
them
tear
me
from
limb
to
limb

I
will
never
leave
this
place
!
"
<EOS>
cry
i.
 
"
<EOS>
be
dog
to
hurry
man
to
shameful
death

<EOS>
Hew
them
down
,
cut
them
in
piece
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
some
foul
mystery
here
!
"
say
the
officer
whom
I
do
not
know
,
draw
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
King
Charles
's
name
,
assist
me
to
secure
this
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
both
set
upon
me
and
force
me
away
,
though
I
fight
and
bit
and
catch
at
them
like
a
madman
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
struggle
,
they
get
me
quietly
between
them
;
and
then
,
my
God
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
angry
dog
tear
at
the
earth
and
throw
it
up
into
the
air
like
water
.
   
<EOS>
what
more
have
I
to
tell
?
 
<EOS>
that
I
fall
upon
my
knee
,
and
with
chatter
tooth
confess
the
truth
,
and
pray
to
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
that
I
have
since
deny
,
and
now
confess
to
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
be
try
for
the
crime
,
find
guilty

and
sentence

<EOS>
that
I
have
not
the
courage
to
anticipate
my
doom
,
or
to

up
manfully
against
it

<EOS>
that
I
have
no

no

no

no

<EOS>
that

happily
lose
for
the
time
those
faculty
which
would
enable
her
to
know
my
misery
or
her

<EOS>
that
I
be
alone
in
this

with
my
evil

,
I
be
write
to
a
man
;
but
let
me
not
think
of
that
,
for
madness
be
in
the
thought
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
understand
my
feeling
?
 
<EOS>
o
yes
,
I
be
sure
you
will
;
and
you
will
respect
them
too
,
and
not
despise
them
,
---
will
you
?
   
<EOS>
let
me
be
calm
.
 
<EOS>
that
portrait
,
---
smile
as
once
he
smile
on
me
;
that
cane
,
---
dangle
as
I
have
see
it
dangle
from
his
hand
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
oft
;
those
leg
that
have
glide
through
my
nightly
dream
and
never
stop
to
speak
;
the
perfectly
gentlemanly
,
though
false
original
,
---
can
I
be
mistaken
?
 
<EOS>
o
no
,
no
.
   
<EOS>
let
me
be
calm
yet
;
I
would
be
calm
as
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
publish
a
letter
from
one
whose
likeness
be
engrave
,
but
whose
name
(
and
wherefore
?
)
be
suppress
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
breathe
that
name
!
<EOS>
be
it
---
but
why
ask
when
my
heart
tell
me
too
truly
that
it
be
!
   
<EOS>
I
would
not
upbraid
him
with
his
treachery
;
I
would
not
remind
him
of
those
time
when
he
plight
the
most
eloquent
of
vow
,
and
procure
from
me
a
small
pecuniary
accommodation
;
and
yet
I
would
see
him
<EOS>
---
see
him
do
I
say
---
<EOS>
him
---
alas
!
<EOS>
such
be
woman
's
nature
.
<EOS>
for
as
the
poet
beautifully
say
---
but
you
will
already
have
anticipate
the
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
sweet
?
 
<EOS>
o
yes
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
city
(
<EOS>
hallow
by
the
recollection
)
<EOS>
that
I
meet
him
first
;
and
assuredly
if
mortal
happiness
be
record
anywhere
,
then
those
rubber
with
their
three
-
and
-
sixpenny
point
be
score

tablet
of
celestial
brass
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
hold
an
honour
---
generally
two
.
 
<EOS>
on
that
eventful
night
we
stand
at
eight
.
 
<EOS>
He
raise
his
eye
<EOS>
(
luminous
in
their
seductive
sweetness
)
to
my
agitated
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
CAN
you
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
with
peculiar
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
the
gentle
pressure
of
his
foot
on
mine
;
our
corn
throb
in
unison
.
 
<EOS>
"
CAN
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
again
;
and
every
lineament
of
his
expressive
countenance
add
the
word
"
resist
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
murmur
"
no
,
"
and
faint
.
   
<EOS>
They
say
,
when
I
recover
,
it
be
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
be
the
nutmeg
in
the
negus
.
 
<EOS>
how
little
do
they
suspect
the
truth
!
 
<EOS>
how
little
do
they
guess
the
deep
mysterious
meaning
of
that
inquiry
!
<EOS>
He
call
next
morning
on
his
knee
;
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
actually
come
in
that
position
to
the
house
-
door
,
but
that
he
go
down
upon
those
joint
directly
the
servant
have
retire
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
some
verse
in
his
hat
,
which
he
say
be
original
,
but
which
I
have
since
find
be
Milton
's
;
likewise
a
little
bottle
label
laudanum
;
also
a
pistol
and
a
sword
-
stick
.
 
<EOS>
He
draw
the
latter
,
uncork
the
former
,
and
click
the
trigger
of
the
pocket
fire
-
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
come
,
he
say
,
to
conquer
or
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrest
from
me
an
avowal
of
my
love
,
and
let
off
the
pistol
out
of
a
back
window
previous
to
partake
of
a
slight
repast
.
   
<EOS>
faithless
,
inconstant
man
!
 
<EOS>
how
many
age
seem
to
have
elapse
since
his
unaccountable
and
perfidious
disappearance
!
 
<EOS>
Could
I
still
forgive
him
both
that
and
the
borrow
lucre
that
he
promise
to
pay
next
week
!
 
<EOS>
Could
I
spurn
him
from
my
foot
if
he
approach
in
penitence
,
and
with
a
matrimonial
object
!
 
<EOS>
Would
the
blandish
enchanter
still
weave
his
spell
around
me
,
or
should
I
burst
them
all
and
turn
away
in
coldness
!
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
trust
my
weakness
with
the
thought

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
Master
Humphrey
's
Visitor
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
in
a
thoughtful
mood
,
I
often
succeed
in
divert
the
current
of
some
mournful
reflection
,
by
conjure
up
a
number
of
fanciful
association
with
the
object
that
surround
me
,
and
dwell
upon
the
scene
and
character
they
suggest
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
lead
by
this
habit
to
assign
to
every
room
in
my
house
and
every
old
staring
portrait
on
its
wall
a
separate
interest
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
I
be
persuade
that
a
stately
dame
,
terrible
to
behold
in
her
rigid
modesty
,
who
hang
above
the
chimney
-
piece
of
my
bedroom
,
be
the
former
lady
of
the
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
courtyard
below
be
a
stone
face
of
surpass
ugliness
,
which
I
have
somehow
---
in
a
kind
of
jealousy
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
---
associate
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
above
my
study
be
a
little
room
with
ivy
peep
through
the
lattice
,
from
which
I
bring
their
daughter
,
a
lovely
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
year
of
age
,
and
dutiful
in
all
respect
save
one
,
that
one
be
her
devoted
attachment
to
a
young
gentleman
on
the
stair
,
whose
grandmother
(
degrade
to
a
disused
laundry
in
the
garden
)
<EOS>
pique
herself
upon
an
old
family
quarrel
,
and
be
the
implacable
enemy
of
their
love
.
 
<EOS>
with
such
material
as
these
I
work
out
many
a
little
drama
,
whose
chief
merit
be
,
that
I
can
bring
it
to
a
happy
end
at
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
so
many
of
them
on
hand
,
that
if
on
my
return
home
one
of
these
evening
I
be
to
find
some
bluff
old
wight
of
two
century
ago
comfortably
seat
in
my
easy
chair
,
and
a
lovelorn
damsel
vainly
appeal
to
his
heart
,
and
lean
her
white
arm
upon
my
clock
itself
,
I
verily
believe
I
should
only
express
my
surprise
that
they
have
keep
me
wait
so
long
,
and
never
honour
me
with
a
call
before
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
in
such
a
mood
as
this
,
sit
in
my
garden
yesterday
morning
under
the
shade
of
a
favourite
tree
,
revelling
in
all
the
bloom
and
brightness
about
me
,
and
feel
every
sense
of
hope
and
enjoyment
quicken
by
this
most
beautiful
season
of
Spring
,
when
my
meditation
be
interrupt
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
my
barber
at
the
end
of
the
walk
,
who
I
immediately
see
be
come
towards
me
with
a
hasty
step
that
betoken
something
remarkable
.
   
<EOS>
My
barber
be
at
all
time
a
very
brisk
,
bustling
,
active
little
man
,
---
for
he
be
,
as
it
be
,
chubby
all
over
,
without
be
stout
or
unwieldy
,
---
but
yesterday
his
alacrity
be
so
very
uncommon
that
it
quite
take
me
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
for
could
I
fail
to
observe
when
he
come
up
to
me
that
his
gray
eye
be
twinkle
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
,
that
his
little
red
nose
be
in
an
unusual
glow
,
that
every
line
in
his
round
bright
face
be
twist
and
curve
into
an
expression
of
pleased
surprise
,
and
that
his
whole
countenance
be
radiant
with
glee
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
more
surprised
to
see
my
housekeeper
,
who
usually
preserve
a
very
staid
air
,
and
stand
somewhat
upon
her
dignity
,
peep
round
the
hedge
at
the
bottom
of
the
walk
,
and
exchange
nod
and
smile
with
the
barber
,
who
twice
or
thrice
look
over
his
shoulder
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
conceive
no
announcement
to
which
these
appearance
could
be
the
prelude
,
unless
it
be
that
they
have
marry
each
other
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
,
consequently
,
a
little
disappointed
when
it
only
come
out
that
there
be
a
gentleman
in
the
house
who
wish
to
speak
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
who
be
it
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
the
barber
,
with
his
face
screw
up
still
tight
than
before
,
reply
that
the
gentleman
would
not
send
his
name
,
but
wish
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
ponder
for
a
moment
,
wonder
who
this
visitor
may
be
,
and
I
remark
that
he
embrace
the
opportunity
of
exchange
another
nod
with
the
housekeeper
,
who
still
linger
in
the
distance
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
I
,
"
bid
the
gentleman
come
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
seem
to
be
the
consummation
of
the
barber
's
hope
,
for
he
turn
sharp
round
,
and
actually
run
away
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
my
sight
be
not
very
good
at
a
distance
,
and
therefore
when
the
gentleman
first
appear
in
the
walk
,
I
be
not
quite
clear
whether
he
be
a
stranger
to
me
or
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
elderly
gentleman
,
but
come
trip
along
in
the
pleasantest
manner
conceivable
,
avoid
the
garden
-
roller
and
the
border
of
the
bed
with
inimitable
dexterity
,
pick
his
way
among
the
flower
-
pot
,
and
smile
with
unspeakable
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
before
he
be
half
-
way
up
the
walk
he
begin
to
salute
me
;
then
I
think
I
know
him
;
but
when
he
come
towards
me
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
the
sun
shine
on
his
bald
head
,
his
bland
face
,
his
bright
spectacle
,
his
fawn-
coloured
tight
,
and
his
black
gaiter
,
---
then
my
heart
warm
towards
him
,
and
I
feel
quite
certain
that
it
be
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
"
say
that
gentleman
as
I
rise
to
receive
him
,
"
pray
be
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
do
not
stand
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
insist
upon
it
,
really
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
these
word
Mr
Pickwick
gently
press
me
down
into
my
seat
,
and
take
my
hand
in
his
,
shake
it
again
and
again
with
a
warmth
of
manner
perfectly
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
express
in
my
welcome
something
of
that
heartiness
and
pleasure
which
the
sight
of
him
awaken
,
and
make
him
sit
down
beside
me
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
he
keep
alternately
release
my
hand
and
grasp
it
again
,
and
survey
me
through
his
spectacle
with
such
a
beam
countenance
as
I
never
till
then
beheld
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
directly
!
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
pleasure
<EOS>
it
be
to
think
that
you
know
me
directly
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
remark
that
I
have
read
his
adventure
very
often
,
and
his
feature
be
quite
familiar
to
me
from
the
publish
portrait
.
<EOS>
as
I
think
it
a
good
opportunity
of
advert
to
the
circumstance
,
I
condole
with
him
upon
the
various
libel
on
his
character
which
have
find
their
way
into
print
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
shake
his
head
,
and
for
a
moment
look
very
indignant
,
but
smile
again
directly
,
add
that
no
doubt
I
be
acquaint
with
Cervantes
's
introduction
to
the
second
part
of
Don
Quixote
,
and
that
it
fully
express
his
sentiment
on
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
now
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
do
not
you
wonder
how
I
find
you
out
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
wonder
,
and
,
with
your
good
leave
,
never
know
,
"
say
I
,
smile
in
my
turn
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
enough
for
me
that
you
give
me
this
gratification
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
least
desire
that
you
should
tell
me
by
what
mean
I
have
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
,
"
return
Mr
Pickwick
,
shake
me
by
the
hand
again
;
"
you
be
so
exactly
what
I
expect
!
 
<EOS>
but
for
what
particular
purpose
do
you
think
I
have
seek
you
,
my
dear
sir
?
<EOS>
now
what
do
you
think
I
have
come
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
put
this
question
as
though
he
be
persuade
that
it
be
morally
impossible
that
I
could
by
any
mean
divine
the
deep
purpose
of
his
visit
,
and
that
it
must
be
hide
from
all
human
ken
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
although
I
be
rejoice
to
think
that
I
have
anticipate
his
drift
,
I
feign
to
be
quite
ignorant
of
it
,
and
after
a
brief
consideration
shake
my
head
despairingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
should
you
say
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
,
lay
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
upon
my
coat
-
sleeve
,
and
look
at
me
with
his
head
throw
back
,
and
a
little
on
one
side
,
---
"
what
should
you
say
<EOS>
if
I
confess
that
after
read
your
account
of
yourself
and
your
little
society
,
I
have
come
here
,
a
humble
candidate
for
one
of
those
empty
chair
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
"
I
return
,
"
that
I
know
of
only
one
circumstance
which
could
still
further
endear
that
little
society
to
me
,
and
that
would
be
the
associating
with
it
<EOS>
my
old
friend
,
---
for
you
must
let
me
call
you
so
,
---
my
old
friend
,
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
I
make
him
this

feature
of
Mr
Pickwick

face
fuse
itself
into
one
all
-
pervade
expression
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
after
shake
me
heartily
by
both
hand
at
once
,
he
pat
me
gently
on
the
back
,
and
then
---
I
well
understand
why
<EOS>
---
colour
up
to
the
eye
,
and
hope
with
great
earnestness
of
manner
that
he
have
not
hurt
me
.
   
<EOS>
if
he
have
,
I
would
have
be
content
that
he
should
have
repeat
the
offence
a
hundred
time
rather
than
suppose
so
;
but
as
he
have
not
,
I
have
no
difficulty
in
change
the
subject
by
make
an
inquiry
which
have
be
upon
my
lip
twenty
time
already
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
tell
me
,
"
say
I
,
"
anything
about
Sam
Weller

<EOS>

<EOS>
Sam

Mr
Pickwick
,
"
be
the
same
as

<EOS>
the
same
true
,
faithful
fellow
that
he
ever
be
.
 
<EOS>
what
should
I
tell
you
about
Sam
,
my
dear
sir
,
except
that
he
be
more
indispensable
to
my
happiness
and
comfort
every
day
of
my
life
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Weller
senior
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Mr
Weller
,
"
return
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
be
in
no
respect
more
alter
than
Sam
,
unless
it
be
that
he
be
a
little
more
opinionated
than
he
be
formerly
,
and
perhaps
at
time
more
talkative
.
 
<EOS>
He
spend
a
good
deal
of
his
time
now
in
our
neighbourhood
,
and
have
so
constitute
himself
a
part
of
my
bodyguard
,
that
when
I
ask
permission
for
Sam
to
have
a
seat
in
your
kitchen
on
clock
night
(
suppose
your
three
friend
think
me
worthy
to
fill
one
of
the
chair
)
,
I
be
afraid
I
must
often
include
Mr
Weller
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
very
readily
pledge
myself
to
give
both
Sam
and
his
father
a
free
admission
to
my
house
at
all
hour
and
season
,
and
this
point
settle
,
we
fall
into
a
lengthy
conversation
which
be
carry
on
with
as
little
reserve
on
both
side
as
if
we
have
be
intimate
friend
from
our
youth
,
and
which
convey
to
me
the
comfortable
assurance
that
Mr
Pickwick
's
buoyancy
of
spirit
,
and
indeed
all
his
old
cheerful
characteristic
,
be
wholly
unimpaired
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
speak
of
the
consent
of
my
friend
as
be
yet
in
abeyance
,
I
repeatedly
assure
him
that
his
proposal
be
certain
to
receive
their
most
joyful
sanction
,
and
several
time
entreat
that
he
would
give
me
leave
to
introduce
him
to
Jack
Redburn
and
Mr
Miles
(
who
be
near
at
hand
)
without
further
ceremony
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
proposal
,
however
,
Mr
Pickwick
's
delicacy
would
by
no
mean
allow
him
to
accede
,
for
he
urge
that
his
eligibility
must
be
formally
discuss
,
and
that
,
until
this
have
be
do
,
he
could
not
think
of
obtrude
himself
further
.
 
<EOS>
the
utmost
I
could
obtain
from
him
be
a
promise
that
he
would
attend
upon
our
next
night
of
meeting
,
that
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
present
him
immediately
on
his
election
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
,
have
with
many
blush
place
in
my
hand
a
small
roll
of
paper
,
which
he
term
his
"
qualification
,
"
put
a
great
many
question
to
me
touch
my
friend
,
and
particularly
Jack
Redburn
,
whom
he
repeatedly
term
"
a
fine
fellow
,
"
and
in
whose
favour
I
could
see
he
be
strongly
predispose
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
satisfy
him
on
these
point
,
I
take
him
up
into
my
room
,
that
he
may
make
acquaintance
with
the
old
chamber
which
be
our
place
of
meeting
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
this
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
,
stop
short
,
"
be
the
clock
!
 
<EOS>
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
really
the
old
clock
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
never
have
come
away
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
advance
towards
it
softly
,
and
lay
his
hand
upon
it
with
as
much
respect
and
as
many
smile
look
as
if
it
be
alive
,
he
set
himself
to
consider
it
in
every
possible
direction
,
now
mount
on
a
chair
to
look
at
the
top
,
now
go
down
upon
his
knee
to
examine
the
bottom
,
now
survey
the
side
with
his
spectacle
almost
touch
the
case
,
and
now
try
to
peep
between
it
and
the
wall
to
get
a
slight
view
of
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
would
retire
a
pace
or
two
and
look
up
at
the
dial
to
see
it
go
,
and
then
draw
near
again
and
stand
with
his
head
on
one
side
to
hear
it
tick
:
 
never
fail
to
glance
towards
me
at
interval
of
a
few
second
each
,
and
nod
his
head
with
such
complacent
gratification
as
I
be
quite
unable
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
His
admiration
be
not
confine
to
the
clock
either
,
but
extend
itself
to
every
article
in
the
room
;
and
really
,
when
he
have
go
through
them
every
one
,
and
at
last
sit
himself
down
in
all
the
six
chair
,
one
after
another
,
to
try
how
they
feel
,
I
never
see
such
a
picture
of
good
-
humour
and
happiness
as
he
present
,
from
the
top
of
his
shine
head
down
to
the
very
last
button
of
his
gaiter
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
well
pleased
,
and
should
have
have
the
utmost
enjoyment
of
his
company
,
if
he
have
remain
with
me
all
day
,
but
my
favourite
,
strike
the
hour
,
remind
him
that
he
must
take
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
tell
him
once
more
how
glad
he
have
make
me
,
and
we
shake
hand
all
the
way
down
-
stair
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
no
sooner
arrive
in
the
Hall
than
my
housekeeper
,
glide
out
of
her
little
room
<EOS>
(
she
have
change
her
gown
and
cap
,
I
observe
)
,
greet
Mr
Pickwick
with
her
good
smile
and
courtesy
;
and
the
barber
,
feign
to
be
accidentally
pass
on
his
way
out
,
make
him
a
vast
number
of
bow
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
housekeeper
courtesie
,
Mr
Pickwick
bow
with
the
utmost
politeness
,
and
when
he
bow
,
the
housekeeper
courtesie
again
;
between
the
housekeeper
and
the
barber
,
I
should
say
that
Mr
Pickwick
face
about
and
bow
with
undiminished
affability
fifty
time
at
least
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
him
to
the
door
;
an
omnibus
be
at
the
moment
pass
the
corner
of
the
lane
,
which
Mr
Pickwick
hail
and
run
after
with
extraordinary
nimbleness
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
get
about
half
-
way
,
he
turn
his
head
,
and
see
that
I
be
still
look
after
him
and
that
I
wave
my
hand
,
stop
,
evidently
irresolute
whether
to
come
back
and
shake
hand
again
,
or
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
behind
the
omnibus
shout
,
and
Mr
Pickwick
run
a
little
way
towards
him
:
then
he
look
round
at
me
,
and
run
a
little
way
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
another
shout
,
and
he
turn
round
once
more
and
run
the
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
after
several
of
these
vibration
,
the
man
settle
the
question
by
take
Mr
Pickwick
by
the
arm
and
put
him
into
the
carriage
;
but
his
last
action
be
to
let
down
the
window
and
wave
his
hat
to
me
as
it
drive
off
.
   
<EOS>
I
lose
no
time
in
open
the
parcel
he
have
leave
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
follow
be
its
content
:
---
     
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
Tale
 
<EOS>
a
good
many
year
have
pass
away
since
old
John
Podgers
live
in
the
town
of
Windsor
,
where
he
be
bear
,
and
where
,
in
course
of
time
,
he
come
to
be
comfortably
and
snugly
bury
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
that
in
the
time
of
King
James
the
First
,
Windsor
be
a
very
quaint
queer
old
town
,
and
you
may
take
it
upon
my
authority
that
John
Podgers
be
a
very
quaint
queer
old
fellow
;
consequently
he
and
Windsor
fit
each
other
to
a
nicety
,
and
seldom
part
company
even
for
half
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
John
Podgers
be
broad
,
sturdy
,
Dutch
-
build
,
short
,
and
a
very
hard
eater
,
as
man
of
his
figure
often
be
.
 
<EOS>
be
a
hard
sleeper
likewise
,
he
divide
his
time
pretty
equally
between
these
two
recreation
,
always
fall
asleep
when
he
have
do
eating
,
and
always
take
another
turn
at
the
trencher
when
he
have
do
sleeping
,
by
which
mean
he
grow
more
corpulent
and
more
drowsy
every
day
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
use
to
be
currently
report
that
when
he
saunter
up
and
down
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
before
dinner
(
as
he
never
fail
to
do
in
fair
weather
)
,
he
enjoy
his
soundest
nap
;
but
many
people
hold
this
to
be
a
fiction
,
as
he
have
several
time
be
see
to
look
after
fat
oxen
on
market
-
day
,
and
have
even
be
hear
,
by
person
of
good
credit
and
reputation
,
to
chuckle
at
the
sight
,
and
say
to
himself
with
great
glee
,
"
live
beef
,
live
beef
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
upon
this
evidence
that
the
wise
people
in
Windsor
(
begin
with
the
local
authority
of
course
)
hold
that
John
Podgers
be
a
man
of
strong
,
sound
sense
,
not
what
be
call
smart
,
perhaps
,
and
it
may
be
of
a
rather
lazy
and
apoplectic
turn
,
but
still
a
man
of
solid
part
,
and
one
who
mean
much
more
than
he
care
to
show
.
 
<EOS>
this
impression
be
confirm
by
a
very
dignified
way
he
have
of
shake
his
head
and
impart
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
pendulous
motion
to
his
double
chin
;
in
short
,
he
pass
for
one
of
those
people
who
,
be
plunge
into
the
Thames
,
would
make
no
vain
effort
to
set
it
afire
,
but
would
straightway
flop
down
to
the
bottom
with
a
deal
of
gravity
,
and
be
highly
respect
in
consequence
by
all
good
man
.
   
<EOS>
be
well
to
do
in
the
world
,
and
a
peaceful
widower
,
---
have
a
great
appetite
,
which
,
as
he
could
afford
to
gratify
it
,
be
a
luxury
and
no
inconvenience
,
and
a
power
of
go
to
sleep
,
which
,
as
he
have
no
occasion
to
keep
awake
,
be
a
most
enviable
faculty
,
<EOS>
---
you
will
readily
suppose
that
John
Podgers
be
a
happy
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
appearance
be
often
deceptive
when
they
least
seem
so
,
and
the
truth
be
that
,
notwithstanding
his
extreme
sleekness
,
he
be
render
uneasy
in
his
mind
and
exceedingly
uncomfortable
by
a
constant
apprehension
that
beset
him
night
and
day
.
   
<EOS>
You
know
very
well
that
in
those
time
there
flourish
diver
evil
old
woman
who
,
under
the
name
of
witch
,
spread
great
disorder
through
the
land
,
and
inflict
various
dismal
torture
upon
christian
man
;
stick
pin
and
needle
into
them
when
they
least
expect
it
,
and
cause
them
to
walk
in
the
air
with
their
foot
upwards
,
to
the
great
terror
of
their
wife
and
family
,
who
be
naturally
very
much
disconcert
when
the
master
of
the
house
unexpectedly
come
home
,
knock
at
the
door
with
his
heel
and
comb
his
hair
on
the
scraper
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
their
commonest
prank
,
but
they
every
day
play
a
hundred
other
,
of
which
none
be
less
objectionable
,
and
many
be
much
more
so
,
be
improper
besides
;
the
result
be
that
vengeance
be
denounce
against
all
old
woman
,
with
whom
even
the
king
himself
have
no
sympathy
(
as
he
certainly
ought
to
have
have
)
,
for
with
his
own
most
gracious
hand
he
pen
a
most
gracious
consignment
of
them
to
everlasting
wrath
,
and
devise
most
gracious
mean
for
their
confusion
and
slaughter
,
in
virtue
whereof
scarcely
a
day
pass
but
one
witch
at
the
least
be
most
graciously
hang
,
drown
,
or
roast
in
some
part
of
his
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
still
the
press
teem
with
strange
and
terrible
news
from
the
North
or
the
South
,
or
the
East
or
the
West
,
relative
to
witch
and
their
unhappy
victim
in
some
corner
of
the
country
,
and
the
Public
's
hair
stand
on
end
to
that
degree
that
it
lift
its
hat
off
its
head
,
and
make
its
face
pale
with
terror
.
   
<EOS>
You
may
believe
that
the
little
town
of
Windsor
do
not
escape
the
general
contagion
.
 
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
boil
a
witch
on
the
king
's
birthday
and
send
a
bottle
of
the
broth
to
court
,
with
a
dutiful
address
expressive
of
their
loyalty
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
,
be
rather
frightened
by
the
present
,
piously
bestow
it
upon
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
and
return
an
answer
to
the
address
,
wherein
he
give
them
golden
rule
for
discover
witch
,
and
lay
great
stress
upon
certain
protect
charm
,
and
especially
horseshoe
.
<EOS>
immediately
the
town
-
people
go
to
work
nail
up
horseshoe
over
every
door
,
and
so
many
anxious
parent
apprentice
their
child
to
farrier
to
keep
them
out
of
harm
's
way
,
that
it
become
quite
a
genteel
trade
,
and
flourish
exceedingly
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
bustle
John
Podgers
eat
and
sleep
as
usual
,
but
shake
his
head
a
great
deal
oftener
than
be
his
custom
,
and
be
observe
to
look
at
the
oxen
less
,
and
at
the
old
woman
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
little
shelf
put
up
in
his
sitting

room
,
whereon
be

in
a
row
which

at
certain
questionable
female

broomstick
whom
he
have

from
his
chamber
window
,
ride
in
the
air
at
night
,
and
be
in
constant
terror
of

<EOS>
at
length
,
from
perpetually
dwell
upon
this
one
idea
,
which
,
be
alone
in
his
head
,
have
all
its
own
way
,
the
fear
of
witch
become
the
single
passion
of
his
life

<EOS>
He
,
who
up
to
that
time
have
never
know
what
it
be
to
dream
,
begin
to
have
vision
of
witch

incessantly

;
and

He

he
who
read
aloud
every
fresh
piece
of
strange
and
terrible
intelligence
that
John

buy
;
and
this
he
always
do
of
an
evening
in
the
little
porch
in
front
of
the
house
,
round
which
the
neighbour
would
flock
in
crowd
to
hear
the
direful

intently
to
Will

,
as

very
much
on
one
side

his
arm
coil
slyly
round
the
waist
of
a
pretty
girl
who

<EOS>
John

,
in
a
high
sugar

and
short
cloak
,
fill
the
opposite
seat
,
and
survey
the
auditory
with
a
look
of
mingled
pride
and
horror
very
edifying
to
see
;
while
the
hearer
,
with
their
head
thrust
forward
and
their
mouth
open
,
listen
and
tremble
,
and
hope
there
be
a
great
deal
more
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
Will
stop
for
an
instant
to
look
round
upon
his
eager
audience
,
and
then
,
with
a
more
comical
expression
of
face
than
before
and
a
settling
of
himself
comfortably
,
which

absorb

occupation

take
no
heed
of
the
approach
of
night
,
or
the
glory
in
which
the
day
go
down
,
when
the
sound
of
a
horse
,
approach
at
a
good
round
trot
,
invade
the
silence
of
the
hour
,
cause
the
reader
to
make
a
sudden
stop
,
and
the
listener
to
raise
their
head
in
wonder

<EOS>
nor

wonder
diminish
when
a
horseman
dash
up
to
the
porch
,

abruptly
check
his
steed
,
inquire
where
one
John

dwell
.
   
<EOS>
"

who
,
find
himself
unobserved

not
only
squeeze
the
young

again
,
but
kiss
her
twice

<EOS>
surely
he
must
have

he
never

<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
cry
Will

drown
the
sound
of
his

which
be
rather
a
loud
one
.
   
<EOS>
the
messenger
turn
towards
him
,
and
with
a
frown
repeat
the
word
more
solemnly
than
before
;
then
tell
his
errand
,
which
be
,
in
brief
,
that
the
people
of
Kingston
have
be
greatly
terrified
for
some
night
past
by
hideous
revel
,
hold
by
witch
beneath
the
gibbet
within
a
mile
of
the
town
,
and
relate
and
depose
to
by
chance
wayfarer
who
have
pass
within
ear
-
shot
of
the
spot
;
that
the
sound
of
their
voice
in
their
wild
orgy
have
be
plainly
hear
by
many
person
;
that
three
old
woman
labour
under
strong
suspicion
,
and
that
precedent
have
be
consult
and
solemn
council
have
,
and
it
be
find
that
to
identify
the
hag
<EOS>
some
single
person
must
watch
upon
the
spot
alone
;
that
no
single
person
have
the
courage
to
perform
the
task
;
and
that
he
have
be
despatch
express
to
solicit
John
Podgers
to
undertake
it
that
very
night
,
as
be
a
man
of
great
renown
,
who
bear
a
charm
life
,
and
be
proof
against
unholy
spell
.
   
<EOS>
John
receive
this
communication
with
much
composure
,
and
say
in
a
few
word
,
that
it
would
have
afford
him
inexpressible
pleasure
to
do
the
Kingston
people
so
slight
<EOS>
a
service
,
if
it
be
not
for
his
unfortunate
propensity
to
fall
asleep
,
which
no
man
regret
more
than
himself
upon
the
present
occasion
,
but
which
quite
settle
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
say
,
there
be
a
gentleman
present
<EOS>
(
and
here
he
look
very
hard
at
a
tall
farrier
)
,
who
,
have
be
engage
all
his
life
in
the
manufacture
of
horseshoe
,
must
be
quite
invulnerable
to
the
power
of
witch
,
and
who
,
he
have
no
doubt
,
from
his
own
reputation
for
bravery
and
good
-
nature
,
would
readily
accept
the
commission
.
 
<EOS>
the
farri
politely
thank
him
for
his
good
opinion
,
which
it
would
always
be
his
study
to
deserve
,
but
add
that
,
with
regard
to
the
present
little
matter
,
he
could
not
think
of
it
on
any
account
,
as
his
depart
on
such
an
errand
would
certainly
occasion
the
instant
death
of
his
wife
,
to
whom
,
as
they
all
know
,
he
be
tenderly
attach
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
so
far
from
this
circumstance
be
notorious
,
everybody
have
suspect
the
reverse
,
as
the
farrier
be
in
the
habit
of
beat
his
lady
rather
more
than
tender
husband
usually
do
;
all
the
married
man
present
,
however
,
applaud
his
resolution
with
great
vehemence
,
and
one
and
all
declare
that
they
would
stop
at
home
and
die
if
needful
(
which
happily
it
be
not
)
in
defence
of
their
lawful
partner
.
   
<EOS>
this
burst
of
enthusiasm
over
<EOS>
,
they
begin
to
look
,
as
by
one
consent
,
toward
Will
Marks
,
who
,
with
his
cap
more
on
one
side
than
ever
,
sit
watch
the
proceeding
with
extraordinary
unconcern
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
hear
openly
to
express
his
disbelief
in
witch
,
but
have
often
cut
such
joke
at
their
expense
as
leave
it
to
be
infer
;
publicly
state
on
several
occasion
that
he
consider
a
broomstick
an
inconvenient
charger
,
and
one
especially
unsuited
to
the
dignity
of
the
female
character
,
and
indulge
in
other
free
remark
of
the
same
tendency
,
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
wild
companion
.
   
<EOS>
as
they
look
at
Will
they
begin
to
whisper
and
murmur
among
themselves
,
and
at
length
one
man
cry
,
"
why
do
not
you
ask
Will
Marks
?
"
   
<EOS>
as
this
be
what
everybody
have
be
think
of
,
they
all
take
up
the
word
,
and
cry
in
concert
,
"
ah
!
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
ask
Will
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
he
do
not
care
,
"
say
the
farri
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
he
,
"
add
another
voice
in
the
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
believe
in
it
,
you
know
,
"
sneer
a
little
man
with
a
yellow
face
and
a
taunting
nose
and
chin
,
which
he
thrust
out
from
under
the
arm
of
a
long
man
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
besides
,
"
say
a
red
-
faced
gentleman
with
a
gruff
voice
,
"
he
be
a
single
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
point
!
"
say
the
farrier
;
and
all
the
married
man
murmur
,
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
it
,
and
they
only
wish
they
be
single
themselves
;
they
would
show
him
what
spirit
be
,
very
soon
.
   
<EOS>
the
messenger
look
towards
Will
Marks
beseechingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
wet
night
,
friend
,
and
my
gray
nag
<EOS>
be
tired
after
yesterday
's
work
---
"
   
here
there
be
a
general
titter
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
resume
Will
,
look
about
him
with
a
smile
,
"
if
nobody
else
put
in
a
well
claim
to
go
,
for
the
credit
of
the
town
I
be
your
man
,
and
I
would
be
,
if
I
have
to
go
afoot
.
 
<EOS>
in
five
minute
I
shall
be
in
the
saddle
,
unless
I
be
deprive
any
worthy
gentleman
here
of
the
honour
of
the
adventure
,
which
I
would
not
do
for
the
world
.
"
   
<EOS>
but
here
arise
a
double
difficulty
,
for
not
only
<EOS>
do
John
Podgers
combat
the
resolution
with
all
the
word
he
have
,
which
be
not
many
,
but
the
young
lady
combat
it
too
with
all
the
tear
she
have
,
which
be
very
many
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Will
,
however
,
be
inflexible
,
parry
his
uncle
's
objection
with
a
joke
,
and
coax
the
young
lady
into
a
smile
in
three
short
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
plain
that
he
set
his
mind
upon
it
,
and
would
go
,
John
Podgers
offer
him
a
few
first
-
rate
charm
out
of
his
own
pocket
,
which
he
dutifully
decline
to
accept
;
and
the
young
lady
give
him
a
kiss
,
which
he
also
return
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
what
a
rare
thing
it
be
to
be
marry
,
"
say
Will
,
"
and
how
careful
and
considerate
all
these
husband
be
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
man
among
them
but
his
heart
be
leap
to
forestall
me
in
this
adventure
,
and
yet
a
strong
sense
of
duty
keep
him
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
husband
in
this
one
little
town
be
a
pattern
to
the
world
,
and
so
must
the
wife
be
too
,
for
that
matter
,
or
they
could
never
boast
half
the
influence
they
have
!
"
   
<EOS>
wait
for
no
reply
to
this
sarcasm
,
he
snap
his
finger
and
withdraw
into
the
house
,
and
thence
into
the
stable
,
while
some
busy
themselves
in
refresh
the
messenger

in
bait
his
steed

in
less
than

by
another
way

with
a
good
cloak
hang
over
his
arm
,
a
good
sword
gird
by
his
side

up

away

He
kiss
his
hand
to
the
girl

nod
to
his
drowsy
uncle
,
wave
his
cap
to
the
rest
---
and
off
they
fly
pell

mell
,
as

all
the
witch

the
man

leave
behind
shake
their
head
doubtfully
,
stroke
their
chin

and
shake
their
head
again

<EOS>
the
farrier
say
that
certainly
Will
Marks
be
a
good
horseman
<EOS>
,
nobody
should
ever
say
he
deny
that
:
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
rash

very
rash
,

there
be
no
tell
what
the
end
of
it
may
be
;
what
do
he
go
for

that
be
what
he

He
wish
the
young
fellow
no
harm

why
do
he
go
?
 
<EOS>
everybody
echo
these
word
,
and
shake
their
head
again
,
have
do
which
they
wish
John
Podgers
good
night
,
and
straggle
home
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
the
Kingston
people
be
in
their
first
sleep
when
Will
Marks
and
his
conductor
ride
through
the
town
and
up
to
the
door
of
a
house
where
sundry
grave
functionary
be
assemble
,
anxiously
expect
the
arrival
of
the
renowned
Podgers
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
a
little
disappointed
to
find
a
gay
young
man
in
his
place
;
but
they
put
the
good
face
upon
the
matter
,
and
give
him
full
instruction
how
he
be
to
conceal
himself
behind
the
gibbet
,
and
watch
and
listen
to
the
witch
,
and
how
at
a
certain
time
he
be
to
burst
forth
and
cut
and
slash
among
them
vigorously
,
so
that
the
suspect
party
may
be
find
bleed
in
their
bed
next
day
,
and
thoroughly
confound
.
 
<EOS>
They
give
him
a
great
quantity
of
wholesome
advice
besides
,
and
---
which
be
more
to
the
purpose
with
Will
---
a
good
supper
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
thing
be
do
,
and
midnight
nearly
come
,
they
sally
forth
to
show
him
the
spot
where
he
be
to
keep
his
dreary
vigil
.
   
<EOS>
the
night
be
by
this
time
dark
and
threatening
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
rumbling
of
distant
thunder
,
and
a
low
sighing
of
wind
among
the
tree
,
which
be
very
dismal
.
 
<EOS>
the
potentate
of
the
town
keep
so
uncommonly
close
to
Will
that
they
tread
upon
his
toe
,
or
stumble
against
his
ankle
,
or
nearly
trip
up
his
heel
at
every
step
he
take
,
and
,
besides
these
annoyance
,
their
tooth
chatter
so
with
fear
,
that
he
seem
to
be

a
dirge
of
castanet
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
they
make
a
halt
at
the
opening
of
a
lonely
,
desolate
space
,
and
,
point
to
a
black
object
at
some
distance
<EOS>
,
ask
<EOS>
Will
if
he
see
that
,
yonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
inform
him
abruptly
that
it
be
the
gibbet
where
he
be
to
watch
<EOS>
,
they
wish
him
good
night
in
an
extremely
friendly
manner
,
and
run
back
as
fast
as
their
foot
would
carry
them
.
   
<EOS>
Will
walk
boldly
to
the
gibbet
,
and
,
glance
upwards
when
he
come
under
it
,
see
---
certainly
with
satisfaction
---
that
it
be
empty
,
and
that
nothing
dangle
from
the
top
but
some
iron
chain
,
which
swing
mournfully
to
and
fro
as
they
be
move
by
the
breeze
.
<EOS>
after
a
careful
survey
of
every
quarter
he
determine
to
take
his
station
with
his
face
towards
the
town
;
both
because
that
would
place
him
with
his
back
to
the
wind
,
and
because
,
if
any
trick
or
surprise
be
attempt
,
it
would
probably
come
from
that
direction
in
the
first
instance
.
 
<EOS>
have
take
these
precaution
,
he
wrap
his
cloak
about
him
so
that
it
leave
the
handle
of
his
sword
free
,
and
ready
to
his
hand
,
and
lean
against
the
gallow
-
tree
with
his
cap
not
quite
so
much
on
one
side
as
it
have
be
before
,
take
up
his
position
for
the
night
.

Second
Chapter
of
Mr
Pickwick
's
Tale
 
<EOS>
We
leave
Will
Marks
lean
under
the
gibbet
with
his
face
towards
the
town
,
scan
the
distance
with
a
keen
eye
,
which
seek
to
pierce
the
darkness
and
catch
the
early
glimpse
of
any
person
or
person
that
may
approach
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
be
quiet
,
and
,
save
the
howling
of
the
wind
as
it
sweep
across
the
heath
in
gust
,
and
the
creaking
of
the
chain
that
dangle
above
his
head
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
sound
to
break
the
sullen
stillness
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
after
half
an
hour
or
so
this
monotony
become
more
disconcerting
to
Will
than
the
most
furious
uproar
would
have
be
,
and
he
heartily
wish
for
some
one
antagonist
with
whom
he
may
have
a
fair
stand
-
up
fight
,
if
it
be
only
to
warm
himself
.
   
<EOS>
truth
to
tell
,
it
be
a
bitter
wind
,
and
seem
to
blow
to
the
very
heart
of
a
man
whose
blood
,
heat
but
now
with
rapid
riding
,
<EOS>
be
the
more
sensitive
to
the
chilling
blast
.
 
<EOS>
Will
be
a
daring
fellow
,
and
care
not
a
jot
for
hard
knock
or
sharp
blade
;
but
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
move
or
walk
about
,
have
just
that
vague
expectation
of
a
sudden
assault
which
make
it
a
comfortable
thing
to
have
something
at
his
back
,
even
though
that
something
be
a
gallow
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
great
faith
in
the
superstition
of
the
age
,
<EOS>
still
such
of
them
as
occur
to
him
do
not
serve
to
lighten
the
time
,
or
to
render
his
situation
the
more
endurable
.
<EOS>
He
remember
how
witch
be
say
to
repair
at
that
ghostly
hour
to
churchyard
and
gibbet
,
and
such
-
like
dismal
spot
,
to
pluck
the
bleed
mandrake
or
scrape
the
flesh
from
dead
man
's
bone
,
as
choice
ingredient
for
their
spell
;
how
,
steal
by
night
to
lonely
place
,
they
dig
grave
with
their
finger
-
nail
,
or
anoint
themselves
before
ride
in
the
air
,
with
a
delicate
pomatum
make
of
the
fat
of
infant
newly
boil
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
and
many
other
fabled
practice
of
a
no
less
agreeable
nature
,
and
all
have
some
reference
to
the
circumstance
in
which
he
be
place
,
pass
and
repasse
in
quick
succession
through
the
mind
of
Will
Marks
,
and
add
a
shadowy
dread
to
that
distrust
and
watchfulness
which
his
situation
inspire
,
render
it
,
upon
the
whole
,
sufficiently
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
foresee
,
too
,
the
rain
begin
to
descend
heavily
,
and
drive
before
the

in
a
thick
mist

obscure
even
those
few

which
the
darkness
of
the
night
have
before
imperfectly
reveal

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
Great

"
   
<EOS>
the
speaker
be
close
behind
him
;
the
voice
be
almost
at
his
ear
.
<EOS>
Will
throw
off
his
cloak
,
draw
his
sword
,
and
dart
swiftly
round
,
seize
a
woman
by
the
wrist
,
who
,
recoil
from
him
with
a
dreadful
shriek
,
fall

rooted
to
the

upon

with
wild
and
glaring
eye
that
quite
appal
him
.
   
<EOS>
"

Will

when

have
confront
each

thus
for
some
time

<EOS>
He
look
in
wonder
and
affright
from
the

who
question
him
to
the
other
whose

he

<EOS>
"

the

more
firmly

not

<EOS>
Will
glance
at
the
two
female
,
and
could
barely
discern
that
the
one
whom
he
address
be
much
the
elder
,
and
that
the
other
be
young
and
of
a
slight
figure
.
 
<EOS>
both
be
deadly
pale
,
their
garment
wet
and
worn
,
their
hair
dishevel
and
stream
in
the
wind

themselves
bow
down
with
grief
and
misery
;
their
whole
appearance
most
dejected
,
wretched

and
forlorn

a
sight
so
different
from
any

have

him
to
the
quick
,
and
all

pitiable

how

this
gibbet
to

ask
the
eld
female

<EOS>
"
I

Will

that

this
I

whether
you
have
no

with
you

with

the

<EOS>
the
woman
speak
together
,
and
Will
retire
a
pace
or
two
while
they
converse
apart
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
hear
them
sob
and
moan
,
and
see
that
they
wrung
their
hand
in
fruitless
agony
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
make
out
little
that
they
say
,
but
between
while
he
gather
enough
to
assure
him
that
his
suggestion
be
not
very
wide
of
the
mark
,
and
that
they
not
only
suspect
by
whom
the
body

also
whither
it

convey

when

once
more

with

so
muffle
over
his

without

to
lead
the
way

<EOS>
through
mud
and
mire
,
and
wind

rain

they
walk
in
silence
a
full
mile

<EOS>
at
length
they
turn
into

lane

suddenly

then
,
without
a

they
ride
on
together
,
leave
the
attendant
behind

<EOS>
They
make
no
halt
nor
slacken
their
pace
until
they
arrive
near
Putney

<EOS>
at
a

wooden
house

up

black
mask

Will
stand
upon
his
guard

scrutinise
this
figure
from

to
foot

<EOS>
the
form
be
that
of
a
man
pretty
far
advanced
in
life

of
a
firm
and
stately
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
be
of
a
rich
and
costly
kind
,
but
so
soil
and
disorder
that
it
be
scarcely

boot

about

there

there

nothing

many
be
the
interruption
which
Will

encounter
from
these
straggler
,
and
many
the
narrow
escape
he
make
.
 
<EOS>
now
some
stout
bully
would
take
his
seat
upon
the
cart
,
insist
to
be
drive
to
his

and

and
demand
that
on

he

then
a

by

all

some

but
Will

be

back
<EOS>
now
he
have
penetrate
so
far

though
he

there

each
support
a

all
observe
a

silence

<EOS>
by
this
dim

solemn
glare

which
make

feel
as

its

the

there

"
   
<EOS>
Will
stand
with
the
purse
in
his
hand
,
and
involuntarily
make
a
gesture
as
though
he
would
return
it
,
for
though
a
thoughtless
fellow
,
he
be
of
a
frank
and
generous
nature
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
two
gentleman
,
extinguish
their
torch
,
caution
him
to
be
go
,
as
their
common
safety
would
be
endanger
by
a
long
delay
;
and
at
the
same
time
their
retreat
footstep
sound
through
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
,
therefore
,
towards
the
point
at
which
he
have
enter
,
and
see
by
a
faint
gleam
in
the
distance
that
the
door
be
again
partially
open
,
grope
his
way
towards
it
and
so
pass
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
meantime
the
local
authority
of
Kingston
have
keep
watch
and
ward
all
the
previous
night
,
fancy
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
that
dismal
shriek
be
bear
towards
them
on
the
wind
,
and
frequently
wink
to
each
other
,
and
draw
closer
to
the
fire
as
they
drink
the
health
of
the
lonely
sentinel
,
upon
whom
a
clerical
gentleman
present
be
especially
severe
by
reason
of
his
levity
and
youthful
folly
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
of
the
gravest
in
company
,
who
be
of
a
theological
turn
,
propound
to
him
the
question
,
whether
such
a
character
be
not
but
poorly
armed
for
single
combat
with
the
Devil
,
and
whether
he
himself
would
not
have
be
a
strong
opponent
;
but
the
clerical
gentleman
,
sharply
reprove
them
for
their
presumption
in
discuss
such
question
,
clearly
show
that
a
fitter
champion
than
Will
could
scarcely
have
be
select
,
not
only
for
that
be
a
child
of
Satan
,
he
be
the
less
likely
to
be
alarm
by
the
appearance
of
his
own
father
,
but
because
Satan
himself
would
be
at
his
ease
in
such
company
,
and
would
not
scruple
to
kick
up
his
heel
to
an
extent
which
it
be
quite
certain
he
would
never
venture
before
clerical
eye
,
under
whose
influence
(
as
be
notorious
)
<EOS>
he
become
quite
a
tame
and
milk
-
and
-
water
character
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
next
morning
arrive
,
and
with
it
no
Will
Marks
,
and
when
a
strong
party
repair
to
the
spot
,
as
a
strong
party
venture
to
do
in
broad
day
,
find
Will
go
and
the
gibbet
empty
<EOS>
,
matter
grow
serious
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
pass
away
and
no
news
arriving
,
and
the
night
go
on
also
without
any
intelligence
,
the
thing
grow
more
tremendous
still
;
in
short
,
the
neighbourhood
work
itself
up
to
such
a
comfortable
pitch
of
mystery
and
horror
,
that
it
be
a
great
question
whether
the
general
feeling
be
not
one
of
excessive
disappointment
,
when
,
on
the
second
morning
,
Will
Marks
return
.
   
<EOS>
however
this
may
be
,
back
Will
come
in
a
very
cool
and
collected
state
,
and
appear
not
to
trouble
himself
much
about
anybody
except
old
John
Podgers
,
who
,
have
be
send
for
,
be
sit
in
the
Town
Hall
cry
slowly
,
and
doze
between
while
.
 
<EOS>
have
embrace
his
uncle
and
assure
him
of
his
safety
,
Will
mount
on
a
table
and
tell
his
story
to
the
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
and
surely
they
would
have
be
the
most
unreasonable
crowd
that
ever
assemble
together
,
if
they
have
be
in
the
least
respect
disappoint
with
the
tale
he
tell
them
;
for
besides
describe
the
Witches
'
dance
to
the
minute
motion
of
their
leg
,
and
perform
it
in
character
on
the
table
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
broomstick
,
he
relate
how
they
have
carry
off
the
body
in
a
copper
caldron
,
and
so
bewitch
him
,
that
he
lose
his
sense
until
he
find
himself
lie
under
a
hedge
at
least
ten
mile
off
,
whence
he
have
straightway
return
as
they
then
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
gain
such
universal
applause
that
it
soon
afterwards
bring
down
express
from
London
<EOS>
the
great
witch
-
finder
of
the
age
,
the
Heaven
-
bear
Hopkins
,
who
have
examine
Will
closely
on
several
point
,
pronounce
it
the
most
extraordinary
and
the
best
accredited
witch-
story
ever
know
,
under
which
title
it
be
publish
at
the
three
Bibles
on
London
Bridge
,
in
small
quarto
,
with
a
view
of
the
caldron
from
an
original
drawing
,
and
a
portrait
of
the
clerical
gentleman
as
he
sit
by
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
on
one
point
Will
be
particularly
careful
:
 
and
that
be
to
describe
for
the
witch
he
have
see
,
three
impossible
old
female
,
whose
likeness
never
be
or
will
be

<EOS>
thus
he
save
the
life
of
the
suspect
party
,
and
of
all
other
old
woman
who
be
drag
before
him
to
be
identify
.
   
<EOS>
this
circumstance
occasion
John
Podgers
much
grief
and
sorrow
,
until
happen
one
day
to
cast
his
eye
upon
his
house
-
keeper
,
and
observe
her
to
be
plainly
afflict
with
rheumatism
,
he
procure
her
to
be
burn
as
an
undoubted
witch
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
service
to
the
state
he
be
immediately
knight
,
and
become
from
that
time
Sir
John
Podgers
.
   
<EOS>
Will
Marks
never
gain
any
clue
to
the
mystery
in
which
he
have
be
an
actor
,
nor
do
any
inscription
in
the
church
,
which
he
often
visit
afterwards
,
nor
any
of
the
limited
inquiry
that
he
dare
to
make
,
yield
him
the
least
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
keep
his
own
secret

he
be
compel

"
<EOS>
"
   
by
this
time
I
begin
to
fear
that
my
friend
would
be
render
impatient
by
my
protract
absence
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
beg
Mr
Pickwick
to
accompany
me
up
-
stair
,
and
leave
the
two
Mr
Wellers
in
the
care
of
the
housekeeper
,
lay
strict
injunction
upon
her
to
treat
them
with
all
possible
hospitality
.
     
<EOS>
IV
 
<EOS>
the
Clock
 
<EOS>
as
we
be
go
up
-
stair
,
Mr
Pickwick
put
on
his
spectacle
,
which
he
have
hold
in
his
hand
hitherto
;
arrange
his
neckerchief
,
smooth
down
his
waistcoat
,
and
make
many
other
little
preparation
of
that
kind
which
man
be
accustomed
to
be
mindful
of
,
when
they
be
go
among
stranger
for
the
first
time
,
and
be
anxious
to
impress
them
pleasantly
.
 
<EOS>
see
that
I
smile
,
he
smile
too
,
and
say
that
if
it
have
occur
to
him
before
he
leave
home
,
he
would
certainly
have
present
himself
in
pump
and
silk
stocking
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
indeed
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
he
say
very
seriously
;
"
I
would
have
show
my
respect
for
the
society
,
by
lay
aside
my
gaiter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
rest
assure
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
they
would
have
regret
your
do
so
very
much
,
for
they
be
quite
attach
to
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
really
!
"
cry
Mr
Pickwick
,
with
manifest
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
they
care
about
my
gaiter
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
seriously
think
that
they
identify
me
at
all
with
my
gaiter
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
they
do
,
"
I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
now
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
that
be
one
of
the
most
charming
and
agreeable
circumstance
that
could
possibly
have
occur
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
write
down
this
short
conversation
,
but
that
it
develop
a
slight
point
in
Mr
Pickwick
's
character
,
with
which
I
be
not
previously
acquaint
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
secret
pride
in
his
leg
.
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
he
speak
,
and
the
accompany
glance
he
bestow
upon
his
tight
,
convince
me
that
Mr
Pickwick
regard
his
leg
with
much
innocent
vanity
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
here
be
our
friend
,
"
say
I
,
open
the
door
and
take
his
arm
in
mine
;
"
let
them
speak
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
---
Gentlemen
,
I
present
to
you
Mr
Pickwick
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
and
I
must
have
be
a
good
contrast
just
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
lean
quietly
on
my
crutch
-
stick
,
with
something
of
a
care
-
wear
,
patient
air
<EOS>
;
he
,
have
hold
of
my
arm
,
and
bow
in
every
direction
with
the
most
elastic
politeness
,
and
an
expression
of
face
whose
sprightly
cheerfulness
and
good
-
humour
know
no
bound
.
<EOS>
the
difference
between
us
must
have
be
more
striking
yet
,
as
we
advance
towards
the
table
,
and
the
amiable
gentleman
,
adapt
his
jocund
step
to
my
poor
tread
,
have
his
attention
divide
between
treat
my
infirmity
with
the
utmost
consideration
,
and
affect
to
be
wholly
unconscious
that
I
require
any
.
   
<EOS>
I
make
him
personally
know
to
each
of
my
friend
in
turn
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
to
the
deaf
gentleman
,
whom
he
regard
with
much
interest
,
and
accost
with
great
frankness
and
cordiality
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
evidently
some
vague
idea
,
at
the
moment
,
that
my
friend
be
deaf
must
be
dumb
also
;
for
when
the
latter
open
his
lip
to
express
the
pleasure
it
afford
him
to
know
a
gentleman
of
whom
he
have
hear
so
much
,
Mr
Pickwick
be
so
extremely
disconcert
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
step
in
to
his
relief
.
   
<EOS>
His
meeting
with
Jack
Redburn
be
quite
a
treat
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
smile
,
and
shake
hand
,
and
look
at
him
through
his
spectacle
,
and
under
them
,
and
over
them
,
and
nod
his
head
approvingly
,
and
then
nod
to
me
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
this
be
just
the
man
;
you
be
quite
right
;
"
and
then
turn
to
Jack
and
say
a
few
hearty
word
,
and
then
do
and
say
everything
over
again
with
unimpaired
vivacity
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Jack
himself
,
he
be
quite
as
much
delighted
with
Mr
Pickwick
as
Mr
Pickwick
could
possibly
be
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
two
people
never
can
have
meet
together
since
the
world
begin
,
who
exchange
a
warm
or
more
enthusiastic
greeting
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
amusing
to
observe
the
difference
between
this
encounter
and
that
which
succeed
,
between
Mr
Pickwick
and
Mr
Miles
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
latter
gentleman
view
our
new
member
as
a
kind
of
rival
in
the
affection
of
Jack
Redburn
,
and
<EOS>
besides
this
,
he
have
more
than
once
hint
to
me
,
in
secret
,
that
although
he
have
no
doubt
Mr
Pickwick
be
a
very
worthy
man
,
still
he
do
consider
that
some
of
his
exploit
be
unbecome
a
gentleman
of
his
year
and
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
over
and
above
these
ground
of
distrust
,
it
be
one
of
his
fix
opinion
,
that
the
law
never
can
by
possibility
do
anything
wrong
;
he
therefore
look
upon
Mr
Pickwick
as
one
who
have
justly
suffer
in
purse
and
peace
for
a
breach
of
his
plighted
faith
to
an
unprotected
female
,
and
hold
that
he
be
call
upon
to
regard
him
with
some
suspicion
on
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
these
cause
lead
to
a
rather
cold
and
formal
reception
;
which
Mr
Pickwick
acknowledge
with
the
same
stateliness
and
intense
politeness
as
be
display
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
assume
an
air
of
such
majestic
defiance
,
that
I
be
fearful
he
may
break
out
into
some
solemn
protest
or
declaration
,
and
therefore
induct
him
into
his
chair
without
a
moment
's
delay
.
   
<EOS>
this
piece
of
generalship
be
perfectly
successful
.
 
<EOS>
the
instant
he
take
his
seat
<EOS>
,
Mr
Pickwick
survey
us
all
with
a
most
benevolent
aspect
,
and
be
take
with
a
fit
of
smile
full
five
minute
long
.
<EOS>
His
interest
in
our
ceremony
be
immense
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
very
numerous
or
complicated
,
and
a
description
of
them
may
be
comprise
in
very
few
word
.
 
<EOS>
as
our
transaction
have
already
be
,
and
must
necessarily
continue
to
be
,
more
or
less
anticipate
by
be
present
in
these
page
at
different
time
,
and
under
various
form
,
they
do
not
require
a
detailed
account
.
   
<EOS>
Our
first
proceeding
when
we
be
assemble
be
to
shake
hand
all
round
,
and
greet
each
other
with
cheerful
and
pleasant
look
.
<EOS>
remember
that
we
assemble
not
only
for
the
promotion
of
our
happiness
,
but
<EOS>
with
the
view
of
add
something
to
the
common
stock
,
an
air
of
languor
or
indifference
in
any
member
of
our
body
would
be
regard
by
the
other
as
a
kind
of
treason
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
never
have
an
offender
in
this
respect
;
but
if
we
have
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
take
to
task
pretty
severely
.
   
<EOS>
Our
salutation
over
,
the
venerable
piece
of
antiquity
from
which
we
take
our
name
be
wind
up
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
the
ceremony
be
always
perform
by
Master
Humphrey
himself
(
in
treating
of
the
club
,
I
may
be
permit
to
assume
the
historical
style
,
and
speak
of
myself
in
the
third
person
)
,
who
mount
upon
a
chair
for
the
purpose
,
arm
with
a
large
key
.
 
<EOS>
while
it
be
in
progress
,
Jack
Redburn
be
require
to
keep
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
under
the
guardianship
of
Mr
Miles
,
for
he
be
know
to
entertain
certain
aspiring
and
unhallowed
thought
connect
with
the
clock
,
and
have
even
go
so
far
as
to
state
that
if
he
may
take
the
work
out
for
a
day
or
two
,
he
think
he
could
improve
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
pardon
him
his
presumption
in
consideration
of
his
good
intention
,
and
his
keep
this
respectful
distance
,
which
last
penalty
be
insist
on
,
l
by
secretly
wound
the
object
of
our
regard
in
some
tender
part
,
in
the
ardour
of
his
zeal
for
its
improvement
,
he
should
fill
us
with
dismay
and
consternation
.
   
<EOS>
this
regulation
afford
Mr
Pickwick
the
high
delight
,
and
seem
,
if
possible
,
to
exalt
Jack
in
his
good
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
ceremony
be
the
opening
of
the
clock
-
case
(
of
which
Master
Humphrey
have
likewise
the
key
)
,
the
taking
from
it
as
many
paper
as
will
furnish
forth
our
evening
's
entertainment
,
and
arrange
in
the
recess
<EOS>
such
new
contribution
as
have
be
provide
since
our
last
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
always
do
with
peculiar
solemnity
.
 
<EOS>
the
deaf
gentleman
then
fill
and
light
his
pipe
,
and
we
once
more
take
our
seat
round
the
table
before
mention
,
Master
Humphrey
act
as
president
,
---
if
we
can
be
say
to
have
any
president
,
where
all
be
on
the
same
social
footing
,
---
and
our
friend
Jack
as
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
Our
preliminary
be
now
conclude
,
we
fall
into
any
train
of
conversation
that
happen
to
suggest
itself
,
or
proceed
immediately
to
one
of
our
reading
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
latter
case
,
the
paper
select
be
consign
to
Master
Humphrey
,
who
flatten
it
carefully
on
the
table
and
make
dog
's
ear
in
the
corner
of
every
page
,
ready
for
turn
over
easily
;
Jack
Redburn
trim
the
lamp
with
a
small
machine
of
his
own
invention
which
usually
put
it
out
;
Mr
Miles
look
on
with
great
approval
notwithstanding
;
the
deaf
gentleman
draw
in
his
chair
,
so
that
he
can
follow
the
word
on
the
paper
or
on
Master
Humphrey
's
lip
as
he
please
;
and
Master
Humphrey
himself
,
look
round
with
mighty
gratification
,
and
glance
up
at
his
old
clock
,
begin
to
read
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
's
face
,
while
his
tale
be
be
read
,
would
have
attract
the
attention
of
the
dull
man
alive
.
 
<EOS>
the
complacent
motion
of
his
head
and
forefinger
as
he
gently
beat
time
,
and
correct
the
air
with
imaginary
punctuation
,
the
smile
that
mantle
on
his
feature
at
every
jocose
passage
,
and
the
sly
look
he
steal
around
to
observe
its
effect
,
the
calm
manner
in
which
he
shut
his
eye
and
listen
when
there
be
some
little
piece
of
description
,
the
change
expression
with
which
he
act
the
dialogue
to
himself
,
his
agony
that
the
deaf
gentleman
should
know
what
it
be
all
about
,
and
his
extraordinary
anxiety
to
correct
the
reader
when
he
hesitate
at
a
word
in
the
manuscript
,
or
substitute
a
wrong
one
,
be
alike
worthy
of
remark
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
at
last
,
endeavour
to
communicate
with
the
deaf
gentleman
by
mean
of
the
finger
alphabet
,
with
which
he
construct
such
word
as
be
unknown
in
any
civilised
or
savage
language
,
he
take
up
a
slate
and
write
in
large
text
,
one
word
in
a
line
,
the
question
,
"
how
---
do
---
<EOS>
you
---
like
---
it
?
"
---
when
he
do
this
,
and
hand
it
over
the
table
await
the
reply
,
with
a
countenance
only
brighten
and
improve
by
his
great
excitement
,
even
Mr
Miles
relaxed
,
and
could
not
forbear
look
at
him
for
the
moment
with
interest
and
favour
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
have
occur
to
me
,
"
say
the
deaf
gentleman
,
who
have
watch
Mr
Pickwick
and
everybody
else
with
silent
satisfaction
---
"
it
have
occur
to
me
,
"
say
the
deaf
gentleman
,
take
his
pipe
from
his
lip
,
"
that
now
be
our
time
for
fill
our
only
empty
chair
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
as
our
conversation
have
naturally
turn
upon
the
vacant
seat
,
we
lend
a
willing
ear
to
this
remark
,
and
look
at
our
friend
inquiringly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
Mr
Pickwick
must
be
acquaint
with
somebody
who
would
be
an
acquisition
to
us
;
that
he
must
know
the
man
we
want
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
not
lose
any
time
,
but
set
this
question
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
so
,
Mr
Pickwick
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
gentleman
address
be
about
to
return
a
verbal
reply
,
but
remember
our
friend
's
infirmity
,
he
substitute
for
this
kind
of
answer
some
fifty
nod
.
 
<EOS>
then
take
up
the
slate
and
printing
on
it
<EOS>
a
gigantic
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
hand
it
across
the
table
,
and
rub
his
hand
as
he
look
round
upon
our
face
,
protest
that
he
and
the
deaf
gentleman
quite
understand
each
other
,
already
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
person
I
have
in
my
mind

say
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
and
whom
I
should
not

time
hence

His

Jack

let
me
see

<EOS>
He
be
the
person
who
have
a
grave
interest
in
old
mouldy
chamber
and
the
Inns
of
Court
,
and
who
relate
some
anecdote
have
reference
to
his
favourite
theme
,

and
an
odd
ghost
story

be
that
the
man

"
   
<EOS>
"
the
very
same
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
,
lower
his
voice
to
a
mysterious
and
confidential
tone
,
"
he
be
a
very
extraordinary
and
remarkable
person
;
living
,
and
talk
,
and
look
,
like
some
strange
spirit
,
whose
delight
be
to
haunt
old
building
;
and
absorb
in
that
one
subject
which
you
have
just
mention
,
to
an
extent
which
be
quite
wonderful
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
retire
into
private
life
,
I
seek
him
out
,
and
I
do
assure
you
that
the
more
I
see
of
him
,
the
more
strongly
I
be
impressed
with
the
strange
and
dreamy
character
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
where
do
he
live
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
live
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
,
"
in
one
of
those
dull
,
lonely
old
place
with
which
his
thought
and
story
be
all
connected
;
quite
alone
,
and
often
shut
up
close
for
several
week
together
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
dusty
solitude
he
brood
upon
the
fancy
he
have
so
long
indulge
,
and
when
he
go
into
the
world
,
or
anybody
from
the
world
without
go
to
see
him
,
they
be
still
present
to
his
mind
and
still
his
favourite
topic
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
say
,
I
believe
,
that
he
have
bring
himself
to
entertain
a
regard
for
me
,
and
an
interest
in
my
visit
;
feeling
which
I
be
certain
he
would
extend
to
Master
Humphrey
's
Clock
if
he
be
once
tempt
to
join
us
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
wish
you
to
understand
be
,
that
he
be
a
strange
,
secluded
visionary
,
in
the
world
but
not
of
it
;
and
as
unlike
anybody
here
as
he
be
unlike
anybody
elsewhere
that
I
have
ever
meet
or
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Miles
receive
this
account
of
our
propose
companion
with
rather
a
wry
face
,
and
after
murmur
that
perhaps
he
be
a
little
mad
,
inquire
if
he
be
rich
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
ask
him
,
"
say
Mr
Pickwick
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
know
,
sir
,
for
all
that
,
"
retort
Mr

,
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
so
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr

,
no
less
sharply
than
the
other
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
"
he
add
,
relapse
into
his
usual
mildness
,
"
I
have
no
means
of
judge
.
 
<EOS>
He
live
poorly
,
but
that
would
seem
to
be
in
keep
with
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
hear
him
allude
to
his
circumstance
,
and
never
fall
into
the
society
of
any
man
who
have
the
slight
acquaintance
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
really
tell
you
all
I
know
about
him
,
and
it
rest
with
you
to
say
whether
you
wish
to
know
more
,
or
know
quite
enough
already
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
be
unanimously
of
opinion
that
we
would
seek
to
know
more
;
and
as
a
sort
of
compromise
with
Mr
Miles
(
who
,
although
he
say
"
yes
---
o
certainly
---
he
should
like
to
know
more
about
the
gentleman
---
he
have
no
right
to
put
himself
in
opposition
to
the
general
wish
,
"
and
so
forth
,
shake
his
head
doubtfully
and
hem
several
time
with
peculiar
gravity
)
,
it
be
arrange
that
Mr
Pickwick
should
carry
me
with
him
on
an
evening
visit
to
the
subject
of
our
discussion
,
for
which
purpose
an
early
appointment
between
that
gentleman
and
myself
be
immediately
agree
upon
;
it
be
understand
that
I
be
to
act
upon
my
own
responsibility
,
and
to
invite
him
to
join
us
or
not
,
as
I
may
think
proper
.
 
<EOS>
this
solemn
question
determine
,
we
return
to
the
clock
-
case
(
where
we
have
be
forestall
by
the
reader
)
,
and
between
its
content
,
and
the
conversation
they
occasion
,
the
remainder
of
our
time
pass
very
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
break
up
,
Mr
Pickwick
take
me
aside
to
tell
me
that
he
have
spend
a
most
charming
and
delightful
evening
.
 
<EOS>
have
make
this
communication
with
an
air
of
the
strict
secrecy
,
he
take
Jack
Redburn
into
another
corner
to
tell
him
the
same
,
and
then
retire
into
another
corner
with
the
deaf
gentleman
and
the
slate
,
to
repeat
the
assurance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
amusing
to
observe
the
contest
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
extend
his
confidence
to
Mr
Miles
,
or
treat
him
with
dignified
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
time
he
step
up
behind
him
with
a
friendly
air
,
and
as
often
step
back
again
without
say
a
word
;
at
last
,
when
he
be
close
at
that
gentleman
's
ear
and
upon
the
very
point
of
whisper
something
conciliating

agreeable
,
Mr

happen
suddenly
to
turn
his
head
,
upon
which
Mr

skip
away

say
with
some
fierceness
,
"

I
be
about

you

"
   
<EOS>
perhaps
the
housekeeper
think
that
in
such
a
guise
young
Tony
would
look
more
like
the
angel
at
Islington
than
anything
else
of
that
name
,
or
perhaps
she
be
disconcert
to
find
her
previously-

Tony
consider
a
moment
,
and
then
say
,
"
be
my

"
   
<EOS>
this
would
seem
a
very
easy
question
to
answer
,
but
instead
of
reply
to
it
,
the
housekeeper
smile
in
great
confusion
,
and
say
that

do
ask
such
extraordinary

Mr

take
upon
himself
to

seem
to

trouble
with

misgive

It
be
,
perhaps
,
on
this
account
that
he
change
the
subject
precipitately

creation

fetch
of
Tony

improvement

reformation

<EOS>
not
confine
himself
to
a
mere
verbal
description
of
his
grandson

ability

Mr

,
when
tea
be
finish

invite
him
by
various
gift
of
pence
and
halfpence
to
smoke
imaginary
pipe

drink
visionary
beer
from
real
pot

imitate
his
grandfather
without
reserve

in
particular
to
go
through
the
drunken
scene
,
which
throw
the
old
gentleman
into
ecstasy

fill
the
housekeeper
with
wonder

<EOS>
nor
be
Mr

's
pride
satisfy
with
even
this
display
,
for
when
he
take
his
leave
he
carry
the
child

like
some
rare
and
astonishing
curiosity

first
to
the
barber

house

afterwards
to
the
tobacconist

,
at

of
which
place
<EOS>
he
repeat
his
performance
with

effect

<EOS>
It

half

past

o'clock

Mr

carry
him
home
upon

and
it
have
be
whisper
abroad
that
at
that
time
the
infant
Tony
be
rather
intoxicate
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
muse
the
other
evening
upon
the
character
and
incident
with
which
I
have
be
so
long
engaged
;
wonder
how
I
could
ever
have
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
completion
of
my
tale
,
and
reproach
myself
for
have
do
so
,
as
if
it
be
a
kind
of
cruelty
to
those
companion
of
my
solitude
whom
I
have
now
dismiss
,
and
could
never
again
recall
;
when
my
clock
strike
ten
.
<EOS>
punctual
to
the
hour
,
my
friend
appear
.
   
<EOS>
on
our
last
night
of
meeting
,
we
have
finish
the
story
which
the
reader
have
just
conclude
.
 
<EOS>
Our
conversation
take
the
same
current
as
the
meditation
which
the
entrance
of
my
friend
have
interrupt
,
and
the
Old
Curiosity
Shop
be
the
staple
of
our
discourse
.
   
<EOS>
I
may
confide
to
the
reader
now
,
that
in
connection
with
this
little
history
I
have
something
upon
my
mind
;
something
to
communicate
which
I
have
all
along
with
difficulty
repressed
;
something
I
have
deem
it
,
during
the
progress
of
the
story
,
necessary
to
its
interest
to
disguise
,
and
which
,
now
that
it
be
over
,
I
wish
,
and
be
yet
reluctant
,
to
disclose
.
   
<EOS>
to
conceal
anything
from
those
to
whom
I
be
attach
,
be
not
in
my
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
never
close
my
lip
where
I
have
open
my
heart
.
<EOS>
this
temper
,
and
the
consciousness
of
have
do
some
violence
to
it
in
my
narrative
,
lay
me
under
a
restraint
which
I
should
have
have
great
difficulty
in
overcoming
,
but
for
a
timely
remark
from
Mr
Miles
,
who
,
as
I
hint
in
a
former
paper
,
be
a
gentleman
of
business
habit
,
and
of
great
exactness
and
propriety
in
all
his
transaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
wish
,
"
my
friend
object
,
"
that
we
have
be
make
acquaint
with
the
single
gentleman
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
his
withhold
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
look
upon
him
at
first
with
suspicion
,
and
cause
me
to
doubt
his
moral
character
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
fully
satisfied
by
this
time
of
his
be
a
worthy
creature
;
but
in
this
respect
he
certainly
would
not
appear
to
have
act
at
all
like
a
man
of
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
"
say
I
,
draw
to
the
table
,
at
which
they
be
by
this
time
seat
in
their
usual
chair
,
"
do
you
remember
that
this
story
bear
another
title
besides
that
one
we
have
so
often
hear
of
late
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Miles
have
his
pocket
-
book
out
in
an
instant
,
and
refer
to
an
entry
therein
,
rejoin
,
"
certainly

<EOS>

Adventures

Master
Humphrey

<EOS>
here
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
note
of
it
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
resume
what
I
have
to
tell
them
,
when
the
same
Mr
Miles
again
interrupt
me
,
observe
that
the
narrative
originate
in
a
personal
adventure
of
my
own
,
and
that
be
no
doubt
the
reason
for
its
being
thus
designate
.
   
<EOS>
this
lead
me
to
the
point
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
one
and
all
forgive
me
,
"
I
return
,
"
if
for
the
great
convenience
of
the
story
,
and
for
its
well
introduction
,
that
adventure
be
fictitious
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
share
,
indeed
,
---
no
light
or
trivial
one
,
---
in
the
page
we
have
read
,
but
it
be
not
the
share
I
feign
to
have
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
brother
,
the
single
gentleman
,
the
nameless
actor
in
this
little
drama
,
stand
before
you
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
see
they
have
not
expect
this
disclosure
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
pursue
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
look
back
upon
my
part
in
it
with
a
calm
,
half
-
smile
pity
for
myself
as
for
some
other
man

I
need
not
say
what
true
gratification
I
derive
from
the
sympathy
and
kindness
with
which
this
acknowledgment
be
receive
;
nor
how
often
it
have
rise
to
my
lip
before
;
nor
how
difficult
I
have
find
it
---
<EOS>
how
impossible
,
when
I
come
to
those
passage
which
touch
me
most
,
and
most
nearly
concern
me
---
to
sustain
the
character
I
have
assume
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
say
that
I
replace
in
the
clock
-
case
the
record
of
so
many
trial
,
---
sorrowfully
,
it
be
true
,
but
with
a
softened
sorrow
which
be
almost
pleasure
;
and
feel
that
in
live
through
the
past
again
,
and
communicate
to
other
the
lesson
it
have
help
to
teach
me
,
I
have
be
a
happy
man

<EOS>
We
linger
so
long
over
the
leave
from
which
I
have
read
,
that
as
I
consign
them
to
their
former
resting

place
,
the
hand
of
my
trusty
clock
point
to
twelve
,
and
there
come
towards
us
upon
the
wind
the
voice
of
the
deep
and
distant
bell
of
St
Paul
's
as
it
strike
the
hour

midnight

"
this

say
I

return
with
a
manuscript
I
have
take
at
the
moment
,
from
the

repository

"
to
be
open
to
such
music

should
be
a
tale

London

face

darkly
see

where
some
deed

such
a
time

this

dimly
shadow
out

here
have
see
the
working

great
machine

have
just
now
cease

<EOS>
Mr
Pickwick
have
,
of
course
,
and
so
have
Mr
Miles
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
and
my
deaf
friend
be
in
the
minority
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
<EOS>
but
a
few
day
before
,
and
could
not
help
tell
them
of
the
fancy
I
have
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
pay
my
fee
of
twopence
upon
enter
,
to
one
of
the
money-
changer
who
sit
within
the
Temple
;
and
fall
,
after
a
few
turn
up
and
down
,
into
the
quiet
train
of
thought
which
such
a
place
awaken
,
pace
the
echo
stone
like
some
old
monk
whose
present
world
lie
all
within
its
wall
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
look
afar
up
into
the
lofty
dome
,
I
could
not
help
wonder
what
be
his
reflection
whose
genius
rear
that
mighty
pile
,
when
,
the
last
small
wedge
of
timber
fix
,
the
last
nail
drive
into
its
home
for
many
century
,
the
clang
of
hammers
,
and
the
hum
of
busy
voice
go
,
and
the
Great
Silence
<EOS>
whole
year
of
noise
have
help
to
make
,
reign
undisturbed
around
<EOS>
,
he
muse
,
as
I
do
now
,
upon
his
work
,
and
lose
himself
amid
its
vast
extent
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
quite
determine
whether
the
contemplation
of
it
would
impress
him
with
a
sense
of
greatness
or
of
insignificance
;
but
when
I
remember
how
long
a
time
it
have
take
to
erect
,
in
how
short
a
space
it
may
be
traverse
even
to
its
remotest
part
,
for
how
brief
a
term
<EOS>
he
,
or
any
of
those
who
care
to
bear
his
name
,
would
live
to
see
it
,
or
know
of
its
existence
<EOS>
,
I
imagine
him
far
more
melancholy
than
proud
,
and
look
with
regret
upon
his
labour
do
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
thought
in
my
mind
,
I
begin
to
ascend
,
almost
unconsciously
,
the
flight
of
step
lead
to
the
several
wonder
of
the
building
,
and
find
myself
before
a
barrier
where
another
money
-
taker
sit
,
who
demand
which
among
them
I
would
choose
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
stone
gallery
,
he
say
,
and
the
whisper
gallery
,
the
geometrical
staircase
,
the
room
of
model
,
the
clock
---
the
clock
be
quite
in
my
way
,
I
stop
him
there
,
and
choose
that
sight
from
all
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
I
grope
my
way
into
the
Turret
which
it
occupy
,
and
see
before
me
,
in
a
kind
of
loft
,
what
seem
to
be
a
great
,
old
oaken
press
with
fold
door
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
throw
back
by
the
attendant
(
who
be
sleep
when
I
come
upon
him
,
and
look
a
drowsy
fellow
,
as
though
his
close
companionship
with
Time
have
make
him
quite
indifferent
to
it
)
,
disclose
a
complicated
crowd
of
wheel
and
chain
in
iron
and
brass
,
---
great
,
sturdy
,
rattle
engine
,
---
suggestive
of
break
a
finger
put
in
here
or
there
,
and
grind
the
bone
to
powder
,
---
and
these
be
the
Clock
!
 
<EOS>
Its
very
pulse
,
if
I
may
use
the
word
,
be
like
no
other
clock
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
mark
the
flight
of
every
moment
with
a
gentle
second
stroke
,
as
though
it
would
check
old
time
,
and
have
him
stay
his
pace
in
pity
,
but
measure
it
with
one
sledge
-
hammer
beat
,
as
if
its
business
be
to
crush
the
second
as
they
come
troop
on
,
and
remorselessly
to
clear
a
path
before
the
Day
of
Judgment
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
down
opposite
to
it
,
and
hear
its
regular
and
never-
change
voice
,
that
one
deep
constant
note
,
uppermost
amongst
all
the
noise
and
clatter
in
the
street
below

mark
that

tumult
rise

it
be
night

it
still
perform
its
function
with
the
same
dull
constancy
,
and
regulate
the
progress
of
the
life
around

the
fancy
come
upon
me
that
this
be
London

Heart

and
that
when
it

cease

the

would
be
no

<EOS>
It
be
night

in

together

<EOS>
there

some

who

hear

heart
of

there
be
a
moral
in
thy

as
I
look
on
at
thy
indomitable
working

which
neither
death
,
nor
press
of
life
,
nor
grief
,
nor
gladness
out

will
influence
one

I
seem
to
hear
a
voice
within
thee
which
sink
into
my
heart
,
bid
me
,
as
I
elbow
my
way
among
the
crowd
,
have
some
thought
for
the
mean
wretch
that
pass
,
and
,
be
a
man
,
to
turn
away
with
scorn
and
pride
from
none
that
bear
the
human
shape

<EOS>
I
be
by
no
means
sure
that
I
may
not
have
be
tempt
to
enlarge
upon
the
subject
,
have
not
the
paper
that
lie
before
me
on
the
table
be
a
silent
reproach
for
even
this
digression
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
them
up
again
when
I
have
get
thus
far
,
and
seriously
prepare
to
read
.
   
<EOS>
the
handwriting
be
strange
to
me
,
for
the
manuscript
have
be
fairly
copy
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
against
our
rule
,
in
such
a
case
,
to
inquire
into
the
authorship
until
the
reading
be
conclude
,
I
could
only
glance
at
the
different
face
round
me
,
in
search
of
some
expression
which
should
betray
the
writer
.
 
<EOS>
whoever
he
may
be
,
he
be
prepared
for
this
,
and
give
no
sign
for
my
enlightenment
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
the
paper
in
my
hand
,
when
my
deaf
friend
interpose
with
a
suggestion
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
have
occur
to
me
,
"
he
say
,
"
bear
in
mind
your
sequel
to
the
tale
we
have
finish
,
that
if
such
of
us
as
have
anything
to
relate
of
our
own
life
could
interweave
it
with
our
contribution
to
the
Clock
,
it
would
be
well
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
this
need
be
no
restraint
upon
us
,
either
as
to
time
,
or
place
,
or
incident
,
since
any
real
passage
of
this
kind
may
be
surround
by
fictitious
circumstance
,
and
represent
by
fictitious
character
.
 
<EOS>
what
if
we
make
this
an
article
of
agreement
among
ourselves
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
proposition
be
cordially
receive
,
but
the
difficulty
appear
to
be
that
here
be
a
long
story
write
before
we
have
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
unless
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
should
have
happen
that
the
writer
of
this
tale
---
which
be
not
impossible
,
for
man
be
apt
to
do
so
when
they
write
---
have
actually
mingle
with
it
something
of
his
own
endurance
and
experience
.
"
   
<EOS>
nobody
speak
,
but
I
think
I
detect
in
one
quarter
that
this
be
really
the
case
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
no
assurance
to
the
contrary
,
"
I
add
,
therefore
,
"
I
shall
take
it
for
grant
that
he
have
do
so
,
and
that
even
these
paper
come
within
our
new
agreement
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
be
mute
<EOS>
,
we
hold
that
understanding
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
and
here
I
be
about
to
begin
again
,
when
Jack
inform
us
softly
,
that
during
the
progress
of
our
last
narrative
,
Mr
Weller
's
Watch
have
adjourn
its
sitting
from
the
kitchen
,
and
regularly
meet
outside
our
door
,
where
he
have
no
doubt
that
august
body
would
be
find
at
the
present
moment
.
 
<EOS>
as
this
be
for
the
convenience
of
listen
to
our
story
,
he
submit
that
they
may
be
suffer
to
come
in
,
and
hear
them
more
pleasantly
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
we
one
and
all
yield
a
ready
assent
,
and
the
party
be
discover
,
as
Jack
have
suppose
,
and
invite
to
walk
in
,
enter
(
though
not
without
great
confusion
at
have
be
detect
)
,
and
be
accommodate
with
chair
at
a
little
distance
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
the
lamp
be
trim
,
the
fire
well
stir
and
burn
brightly
,
the
hearth
clean
sweep
,
the
curtain
closely
draw
,
the
clock
wind
up
,
we
enter
on
our
new
story
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
again
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
My
fire
burn
cheerfully
;
the
room
be
fill
with
my
old
friend
's
sober
voice
;
and
I
be
leave
to
muse
upon
the
story
we
have
just
now
finish
.
   
<EOS>
It
make
me
smile
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
to
think
if
there
be
any
one
to
see
me
sit
in
my
easy
-
chair
,
my
gray
head
hang
down
,
my
eye
bend
thoughtfully
upon
the
glow
ember
,
and
my
crutch
---
emblem
of
my
helplessness
---
lie
upon
the
hearth
at
my
foot
,
how
solitary
I
should
seem
.
 
<EOS>
yet
though
I
be
the
sole
tenant
of
this
chimney
-
corner
,
though
I
be
childless
and
old
,
I
have
no
sense
of
loneliness
at
this
hour
;
but
be
the
centre
of
a
silent
group
whose
company
I
love
.
   
<EOS>
thus
,
even
age
and
weakness
have
their
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
young
man
,
if
I
be
more
active
,
more
strongly
bind
and
tie
to
life
,
these
visionary
friend
would
shun
me
,
or
I
should
desire
to
fly
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
be
what
I
be
,
I
can
court
their
society
,
and
delight
in
it
;
and
pass
whole
hour
in
picture
to
myself
the
shadow
that
perchance
flock
every
night
into
this
chamber
,
and
in
imagine
with
pleasure
what
kind
of
interest
they
have
in
the
frail
,
feeble
mortal
who
be
its
sole
inhabitant
.
   
<EOS>
all
the
friend
I
have
ever
lose
<EOS>
I
find
again
among
these
visitor
.
<EOS>
I
love
to
fancy
their
spirit
hover
about
me
,
feel
still
some
earthly
kindness
for
their
old
companion
,
and
watch
his
decay
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
weak
,
he
decline
apace
,
he
draw
nearer
and
near
to
us
,
and
will
soon
be
conscious
of
our
existence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
what
be
there
to
alarm
me
in
this
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
encouragement
and
hope
.
   
<EOS>
these
thought
have
never
crowd
on
me
half
so
fast
as
they
have
do
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
face
<EOS>
I
have
long
forget
<EOS>
have
become
familiar
to
me
once
again
;
trait
I
have
endeavour
to
recall
for
year
have
come
before
me
in
an
instant
;
nothing
be
change
but
me
;
and
even
I
can
be
my
former
self
at
will
.
   
<EOS>
raise
my
eye
but
now
to
the
face
of
my
old
clock
,
I
remember
,
quite
involuntarily
,
the
veneration
,
not
unmixed
with
a
sort
of
childish
awe
,
with
which
I
use
to
sit
and
watch
it
as
it
tick
,
unheeded
in
a
dark
staircase
corner
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
look
more
grave
and
steady
when
I
meet
its
dusty
face
,
as
if
,
have
that
strange
kind
of
life
within
it
,
and
be
free
from
all
excess
of
vulgar
appetite
,
and
warn
all
the
house
by
night
and
day
,
it
be
a
sage
.
 
<EOS>
how
often
have
I
listen
to
it
as
it
tell
the
bead
of
time
,
and
wonder
at
its
constancy
!
 
<EOS>
how
often
watch
it
slowly
point
round
the
dial
,
and
,
while
I
pant
for
the
eagerly
expect
hour
to
come
,
admire
,
despite
myself
,
its
steadiness
of
purpose
and
lofty
freedom
from
all
human
strife
,
impatience
,
and
desire
!
   
<EOS>
I
think
it
cruel
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
of
heart
,
to
my
mind
,
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
servant
even
then
;
and
I
feel
as
though
it
ought
to
show
some
sorrow
;
as
though
it
want
sympathy
with
us
in
our
distress
,
and
be
a
dull
,
heartless
,
mercenary
creature
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
soon
I
learn
to
know
that
in
its
ceaseless
go
on
,
and
in
its
be
check
or
stay
by
nothing
,
lay
its
great
kindness
,
and
the
only
balm
for
grief
and
wound
peace
of
mind
.
   
<EOS>
to
-
night
,
to
-
night
,
when
this
tranquillity
and
calm
be
on
my
spirit
,
and
memory
present
so
many
shift
scene
before
me
,
I
take
my
quiet
stand
at
will
by
many
a
fire
that
have
be
long
extinguish
,
and
mingle
with
the
cheerful
group
that
cluster
round
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
be
sorrowful
in
such
a
mood
,
I
should
grow
sad
to
think
what
a
poor
blot
I
be
upon
their
youth
and
beauty
once
,
and
now
how
few
remain
to
put
me
to
the
blush
;
I
should
grow
sad
to
think
that
such
among
them
as
I
sometimes
meet
with
in
my
daily
walk
be
scarcely
less
infirm
than
I
;
that
time
have
bring
us
to
a
level
;
and
that
all
distinction
fade
and
vanish
as
we
take
our
tremble
step
towards
the
grave
.
   
<EOS>
but
memory
be
give
us
for
well
purpose
than
this
,
and
mine
be
not
a
torment
,
but
a
source
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
to
muse
upon
the
gaiety
and
youth
I
have
know
suggest
to
me
glad
scene
of
harmless
mirth
that
may
be
pass
now
.
 
<EOS>
from
contemplate
them
apart
,
I
soon
become
an
actor
in
these
little
drama
,
and
humour
my
fancy
,
lose
myself
among
the
being
it
invoke
.
   
<EOS>
when
my
fire
be
bright
and
high
,
and
a
warm
blush
mantle
in
the
wall
and
ceiling
of
this
ancient
room
;
when
my
clock
make
cheerful
music
,
like
one
of
those
chirp
insect
who
delight
in
the
warm
hearth
,
and
be
sometimes
,
by
a
good
superstition
,
look
upon
as
the
harbinger
of
fortune
and
plenty
to
that
household
in
whose
mercy
they
put
their
humble
trust
;
when
everything
be
in
a
ruddy
genial
glow
,
and
there
be
voice
in
the
crackle
flame
,
and
smile
in
its
flashing
light
,
other
smile
and
other
voice
congregate
around
me
,
invade
,
with
their
pleasant
harmony
,
the
silence
of
the
time
.
   
<EOS>
for
then
a
knot
of
youthful
creature
gather
round
my
fireside
,
and
the
room
re
-
echo
to
their
merry
voice
.
 
<EOS>
My
solitary
chair
no
longer
hold
its
ample
place
before
the
fire
,
but
be
wheel
into
a
small
corner
,
to
leave
more
room
for
the
broad
circle
form
about
the
cheerful
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
son
,
and
daughter
,
and
grandchild
,
and
we
be
assemble
on
some
occasion
of
rejoice
common
to
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
birthday
,
perhaps
,
or
perhaps
it
may
be
Christmas
time
;
but
be
it
<EOS>
what
it
may
,
there
be
rare
holiday
among
us
;
we
be
full
of
glee
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
chimney
-
comer
,
opposite
myself
,
sit
one
who
have
grow
old
beside
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
change
,
of
course
;
much
changed
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
recognise
the
girl
even
in
that
gray
hair
and
wrinkle
brow
.
<EOS>
glance
from
the
laugh
child
who
half
hide
in
her
ample
skirt
,
and
half
peep
out
,
---
and
from
her
to
the
little
matron
of
twelve
year
old
,
who
sit
so
womanly
and
so
demure
at
no
great
distance
from
me
,
---
and
from
her
again
,
to
a
fair
girl
in
the
full
bloom
of
early
womanhood
,
the
centre
of
the
group
,
who
have
glance
more
than
once
towards
the
opening
door
,
and
by
whom
the
child
,
whisper
and
titter
among
themselves
,
WILL
leave
a
vacant
chair
,
although
she
bid
them
not
,
---
I
see
her
image
thrice
repeat
,
and
feel
how
long
it
be
before
one
form
and
set
of
feature
wholly
pass
away
,
if
ever
,
from
among
the
living
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
dwell
upon
this
,
and
trace
out
the
gradual
change
from
infancy
to
youth
,
from
youth
to
perfect
growth
,
from
that
to
age
,
and
think
,
with
an
old
man
's
pride
,
that
she
be
comely
yet
,
I
feel
a
slight
thin
hand
upon
my
arm
,
and
,
look
down
,
see
seat
at
my
foot
a
crippled
boy
,
---
a
gentle
,
patient
child
,
---
whose
aspect
I
know
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
rest
upon
a
little
crutch
,
---
<EOS>
I
know
it
too
,
---
and
lean
on
it
as
he
climb
my
footstool
,
whisper
in
my
ear
,
"
I
be
hardly
one
of
these
,
dear
grandfather
,
although
I
love
them
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
kind
to
me
,
but
you
will
be
kind
still
,
I
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
my
hand
upon
his
neck
,
and
stoop
to
kiss
him
,
when
my
clock
strike
,
my
chair
be
in
its
old
spot
,
and
I
be
alone
.
   
<EOS>
what
<EOS>
if
I
be
?
 
<EOS>
what
if
this
fireside
be
tenantless
,
save
for
the
presence
of
one
weak
old
man
?
 
<EOS>
from
my
house
-
top
I
can
look
upon
a
hundred
home
,
in
every
one
of
which
these
social
companion
be
matter
of
reality
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
daily
walk
<EOS>
I
pass
a
thousand
man
whose
care
be
all
forget
,
whose
labour
be
make
light
,
whose
dull
routine
of
work
from
day
to
day
be
cheer
and
brighten
by
their
glimpse
of
domestic
joy
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
amid
the
struggle
of
this
struggle
town
what
cheerful
sacrifice
be
make
;
what
toil
endure
with
readiness
;
what
patience
show
and
fortitude
display
for
the
mere
sake
of
home
and
its
affection
!
 
<EOS>
let
me
thank
Heaven
that
I
can
people
my
fireside
with
shadow
such
as
these
;
with
shadow
of
bright
object
that
exist
in
crowd
about
me
;
and
let
me
say
,
"
I
be
alone
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
never
be
less
so
<EOS>
---
I
write
it
with
a
grateful
heart
---
than
I
be
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
recollection
of
the
past
and
vision
of
the
present
come
to
bear
me
company
;
the
mean
man
to
whom
I
have
ever
give
alm
appear
,
to
add
his
mite
of
peace
and
comfort
to
my
stock
;
and
whenever
the
fire
within
me
shall
grow
cold
,
to
light
my
path
upon
this
earth
no
more
,
I
pray
that
it
may
be
at
such
an
hour
as
this
,
and
when
I
love
the
world
as
well
as
I
do
now
.
    
<EOS>
the
deaf
gentleman
from
his
own
apartment
 
<EOS>
Our
dear
friend
lay
down
his
pen
at
the
end
of
the
forego
paragraph
,
to
take
it
up
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
little
think
ever
to
employ
mine
upon
so
sorrowful
a
task
as
that
which
he
have
leave
me
,
and
to
which
I
now
devote
it
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
do
not
appear
among
us
at
his
usual
hour
next
morning
,
we
knock
gently
at
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
no
answer
be
give
,
it
be
softly
open
;
and
then
,
to
our
surprise
,
we
see
him
seat
before
the
ashe
of
his
fire
,
with
a
little
table
<EOS>
I
be
accustomed
to
set
at
his
elbow
when
I
leave
him
for
the
night
at
a
short
distance
from
him
,
as
though
he
have
push
it
away
with
the
idea
of
rise
and
retire
to
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
His
crutch
and
footstool
lie
at
his
foot
as
usual
,
and
he
be
dressed
in
his
chamber
-
gown
,
which
he
have
put
on
before
I
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
recline
in
his
chair
,
in
his
accustomed
posture
,
with
his
face
towards
the
fire
,
and
seem
absorb
in
meditation
,
---
indeed
,
at
first
,
we
almost
hope
he
be
.
   
<EOS>
go
up
to
him
,
we
find
him
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
,
very
often
,
see
him
sleep
,
and
always
peacefully
,
but
I
never
see
him
look
so
calm
and
tranquil
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
wear
a
serene
,
benign
expression
,
which
have
impress
me
very
strongly
when
we
last
shake
hand
;
not
that
he
have
ever
have
any
other
look
,
God
know
;
but
there
be
something
in
this
so
very
spiritual
,
so
strangely
and
indefinably
ally
to
youth
,
although
his
head
be
gray
and
venerable
,
that
it
be
new
even
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
upon
me
all
at
once
when
on
some
slight
pretence
he
call
me
back
upon
the
previous
night
to
take
me
by
the
hand
again
,
and
once
more
say
,
"
God
bless
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
a
bell
-
rope
hang
within
his
reach
,
but
he
have
not
move
towards
it
;
nor
have
he
stir
,
we
all
agree
,
except
,
as
I
have
say
,
to
push
away
his
table
,
which
he
could
have
do
,
and
no
doubt
do
,
with
a
very
slight
motion
of
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
relapse
for
a
moment
into
his
late
train
of
meditation
,
and
,
with
a
thoughtful
smile
upon
his
face
,
have
die
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
long
know
it
to
be
his
wish
that
whenever
this
event
should
come
to
pass
we
may
be
all
assemble
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
lose
no
time
in
send
for
Mr
Pickwick
and
for
Mr
Miles
,
both
of
whom
arrive
before
the
messenger
's
return
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
purpose
to
dilate
upon
the
sorrow
and
affectionate
emotion
of
which
I
be
at
once
the
witness
and
the
sharer
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
may
say
,
of
the
humbler
mourner
,
that
his
faithful
housekeeper
be
fairly
heart
-
break
;
that
the
poor
barber
would
not
be
comfort
;
and
that
I
shall
respect
the
homely
truth
and
warmth
of
heart
of
Mr
Weller
and
his
son
to
the
last
moment
of
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
sweet
old
creetur
,
sir
,
"
say
the
eld
Mr
Weller
to
me
in
the
afternoon
,
"
have
bolt
.
 
<EOS>
Him
as
have
no
wice
,
and
be
so
free
from
temper
that
a
infant
may
ha
"
drive
him
,
have

take
at

with
that

ere
unawoidable
fit
o
'
stagger
as
we
all
must
come
to
,
and
go
off
his
feed
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
,
with
a
moisture
in
his
eye
,
which
could
not
be
mistaken
,
---
"
<EOS>
I
see
him
gettin
'
,
every
journey
,
more
and
more
groggy
;
I
say
to
Samivel
,
"
<EOS>
My
boy
!
<EOS>
the
Grey
's
a

goin

at
the
knee
;
"
and
now
my
prediliction
be
fatally
werified
,
and
him
as
I
could
never
do
enough
to
serve
or
show
my
likin

for
,
be
up
the
great
uniwersal
spout
o
'
natur
'
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
the
less
sensible
of
the
old
man
's
attachment
because
he
express
it
in
his
peculiar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
can
truly
assert
of
both
him
and
his
son
,
that
notwithstanding
the
extraordinary
dialogue
they
hold
together
,
and
the
strange
commentary
and
correction
with
which
each
of
them
illustrate
the
other
's
speech
,
I
do
not
think
it
possible
to
exceed
the
sincerity
of
their
regret
;
and
that
I
be
sure
their
thoughtfulness
and
anxiety
in
anticipate
the
discharge
of
many
little
office
of
sympathy
would
have
do
honour
to
the
most
delicate
-
minded
person
.
   
<EOS>
Our
friend
have
frequently
tell
us
that
his
will
would
be
find
in
a
box
in
the
Clock
-
case
,
the
key
of
which
be
in
his
writing
-
desk
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
tell
us
also
that
he
desire
it
to
be
open
immediately
after
his
death
,
whenever
that
should
happen
,
we
meet
together
that
night
for
the
fulfilment
of
his
request
.
   
<EOS>
We
find
it
where
he
have
tell
us
,
wrap
in
a
seal
paper
,
and
with
it
a
codicil
of
recent
date
,
in
which
he
name
Mr
Miles
and
Mr
Pickwick
his
executor
,
---
as
have
no
need
of
any
great
benefit
from
his
estate
than
a
generous
token
(
which
he
bequeath
to
them
)
of
his
friendship
and
remembrance
.
   
<EOS>
after
point
out
the
spot
in
which
he
wish
his
ashe
to
repose
,
he
give
to
"
his
dear
old
friend
,
"
Jack
Redburn
and
myself
,
his
house
,
his
book
,
his
furniture
,
---
in
short
,
all
that
his
house
contain
;
and
with
this
legacy
more
ample
mean
of
maintain
it
in
its
present
state
than
we
,
with
our
habit
and
at
our
term
of
life
,
can
ever
exhaust
.
 
<EOS>
besides
these
gift
,
he
leave
to
us
,
in
trust
,
an
annual
sum
of
no
insignificant
amount
,
to
be
distribute
in
charity
among
his
accustomed
pensioner
---
they
be
a
long
list
---
and
such
other
claimant
on
his
bounty
as
may
,
from
time
to
time
,
present
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
true
charity
not
only
cover
a
multitude
of
sin
,
but
include
a
multitude
of
virtue
,
such
as
forgiveness
,
liberal
construction
,
gentleness
and
mercy
to
the
fault
of
other
,
and
the
remembrance
of
our
own
imperfection
and
advantage
,
he
bid
us
not
inquire
too
closely
into
the
venial
error
of
the
poor
,
but
find
that
they
be
poor
,
first
to
relieve
and
then
endeavour
---
at
an
advantage
---
to
reclaim
them
.
   
<EOS>
to
the
housekeeper
he
leave
an
annuity
,
sufficient
for
her
comfortable
maintenance
and
support
through
life
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
barber
,
who
have
attend
him
many
year
,
he
make
a
similar
provision
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
may
make
two
remark
in
this
place
:
 
first
,
that
I
think
this
pair
be
very
likely
to
club
their
mean
together
and
make
a
match
of
it
;
and
secondly
,
that
I
think
my
friend
have
this
result
in
his
mind
,
for
I
have
hear
him
say
,
more
than
once
,
that
he
could
not
concur
with
the
generality
of
mankind
in
censure
equal
marriage
make
in
later
life
,
since
there
be
many
case
in
which
such
union
could
not
fail
to
be
a
wise
and
rational
source
of
happiness
to
both
party
.
   
<EOS>
the
eld
Mr
Weller
be
so
far
from
view
this
prospect
with
any
feeling
of
jealousy
,
that
he
appear
to
be
very
much
relieve
by
its
contemplation
;
and
his
son
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
participate
in
this
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
of
opinion
,
however
,
that
the
old
gentleman
's
danger
,
even
at
its
crisis
,
be
very
slight
,
and
that
he
merely
labour
under
one
of
those
transitory
weakness
to
which
person
of
his
temperament
be
now
and
then
liable
,
and
which
become
less
and
less
alarming
at
every
return
,
until
they
wholly
subside
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
remain
a
jolly
old
widower
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
as
he
have
already
inquire
of
me
,
with
much
gravity
,
whether
a
writ
of
habea
corpus
would
enable
him
to
settle
his
property
upon
Tony
beyond
the
possibility
of
recall
;
and
have
,
in
my
presence
,
conjure
his
son
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
that
in
the
event
of
his
ever
become
amorous
again
,
he
will
put
him
in
a
strait
-
waistcoat
until
the
fit
be
past
,
and
distinctly
inform
the
lady
that
his
property
be
"
make
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
although
I
have
very
little
doubt
that
Sam
would
dutifully
comply
with
these
injunction
in
a
case
of
extreme
necessity
,
and
that
he
would
do
so
with
perfect
composure
and
coolness
,
I
do
not
apprehend
thing
<EOS>
will
ever
come
to
that
pass
,
as
the
old
gentleman
seem
perfectly
happy
in
the
society
of
his
son
,
his
pretty
daughter
-
in-
law
,
and
his
grandchild
,
and
have
solemnly
announce
his
determination
to
"
take
arter
the
old
'
un
in
all
respect
;
"
from
which
I
infer
that
it
be
his
intention
to
regulate
his
conduct
by
the
model
of
Mr
Pickwick
,
who
will
certainly
set
him
the
example
of
a
single
life
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
diverge
for
a
moment
from
the
subject
with
which
I
set
out
,
for
I
know
that
my
friend
be
interested
in
these
little
matter
,
and
I
have
a
natural
tendency
to
linger
upon
any
topic
that
occupy
his
thought
or
give
him
pleasure
and
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
His
remain
wish
be
very
briefly
tell
.
 
<EOS>
He
desire
that
we
would
make
him
the
frequent
subject
of
our
conversation
;
at
the
same
time
,
that
we
would
never
speak
of
him
with
an
air
of
gloom
or
restraint
,
but
frankly
,
and
as
one
whom
we
still
love
and
hope
to
meet
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
trust
that
the
old
house
would
wear
no
aspect
of
mourning
,
but
that
it
would
be
lively
and
cheerful
;
and
that
we
would
not
remove
or
cover
up
his
picture
,
which
hang
in
our
dining
-
room
,
but
make
it
our
companion
as
he
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
room
,
our
place
of
meeting
,
remain
,
at
his
desire
,
in
its
accustomed
state
;
our
seat
be
place
about
the
table
as
of
old
;
his
easy
-
chair
,
his
desk
,
his
crutch
,
his
footstool
,
hold
their
accustomed
place
,
and
the
clock
stand
in
its
familiar
corner
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
into
the
chamber
at
stated
time
to
see
that
all
be
as
it
should
be
,
and
to
take
care
that
the
light
and
air
be
not
shut
out
,
for
on
that
point
he
express
a
strong
solicitude
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
his
fancy
that
the
apartment
should
not
be
inhabit
;
that
it
should
be
religiously
preserve
in
this
condition
,
and
that
the
voice
of
his
old
companion
should
be
hear
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
My
own
history
may
be
sum
up
in
very
few
word
;
and
even
those
I
should
have
spare
the
reader
but
for
my
friend
's
allusion
to
me
some
time
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
deep
sorrow
than
the
loss
of
a
child
,
---
<EOS>
an
only
daughter
,
who
be
live
,
and
who
flee
from
her
father
's
house
but
a
few
week
before
our
friend
and
I
first
meet
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
speak
of
this
even
to
him
,
because
I
have
always
love
her
,
and
I
could
not
bear
to
tell
him
of
her
error
until
I
could
tell
him
also
of
her
sorrow
and
regret
.
 
<EOS>
happily
I
be
enable
to
do
so
some
time
ago
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
will
not
be
long
,
with
Heaven
's
leave
,
before
she
be
restore
to
me
;
before
I
find
in
her
and
her
husband
the
support
of
my
decline
year
.
   
<EOS>
for
my
pipe
,
it
be
an
old
relic
of
home
,
a
thing
of
no
great
worth
,
a
poor
trifle
,
but
sacred
to
me
for
her
sake
.
   
<EOS>
thus
,
since
the
death
of
our
venerable
friend
,
Jack
Redburn
and
<EOS>
I
have
be
the
sole
tenant
of
the
old
house
;
and
,
day
by
day
,
have
lounge
together
in
his
favourite
walk
.
 
<EOS>
Mindful
of
his
injunction
,
we
have
long
be
able
to
speak
of
him
with
ease
and
cheerfulness
,
and
to
remember
him
as
he
would
be
remember
.
 
<EOS>
from
certain
allusion
which
Jack
have
drop
,
to
his
have
be
desert
and
cast
off
in
early
life
,
I
be
incline
to
believe
that
some
passage
of
his
youth
may
possibly
be
shadow
out
in
the
history
of
Mr
Chester
and
his
son
,
but
see
that
he
avoid
the
subject
,
I
have
not
pursue
it
.
   
<EOS>
My
task
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
chamber
in
which
we
have
while
away
so
many
hour
,
not
,
I
hope
,
without
some
pleasure
and
some
profit
,
be
desert
;
our
happy
hour
of
meeting
strike
no
more
;
the
chimney-
corner
have
grow
cold
;
and
MASTER
HUMPHREY
'S
CLOCK
have
stop
for
ever
.
