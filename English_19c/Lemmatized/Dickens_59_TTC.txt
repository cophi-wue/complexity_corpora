which

strange

have
prove
more
important

under

with
such

have
his

cut
off

his
tongue
tear
out

his

<EOS>
It

that

a

terrible

<EOS>
It
be
likely
enough
that
in
the
rough
outhouse
of
some
tiller
of
the
heavy
land
adjacent

Paris
,
there
be
shelter
from

which
the
Farmer

Death
,
have
already
set
apart
to
be
his
tumbril
of
the
Revolution

<EOS>
but
that
Woodman

Farmer
,
though
they
work
unceasingly
,
work
silently
,
and
no
one
hear
them
as
they
go

<EOS>
the
rather
,
forasmuch
as
to
entertain
any
suspicion
that
they
be
awake

be
to
be
atheistical

traitorous

<EOS>
in

there

scarcely
an

<EOS>
the
Mail
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
Dover
road
that
lie
,
on
a
Friday
night
late
in
November
,
before
the
first
of
the
person
with
whom
this
history
have
business
.
<EOS>
the
Dover
road
lie
,
as
to
him
,
beyond
the
Dover
mail
,
as
it
lumber
up
Shooter
's
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
up
hill
in
the
mire
by
the
side
of
the
mail
,
as
the
rest
of
the
passenger
do
;
not
because
they
have
the
least
relish
for
walk
exercise
,
under
the
circumstance
,
but
because
the
hill
,
and
the
harness
,
and
the
mud
,
and
the
mail
,
be
all
so
heavy
,
that
the
horse
have
three
time
already
come
to
a
stop
,
besides
once
draw
the
coach
across
the
road
,
with
the
mutinous
intent
of
take
it
back
to
Blackheath
.
 
<EOS>
Reins
and
whip
and
coachman
and
guard
,
however
,
in
combination
,
have
read
that
article
of
war
which
forbid
a
purpose
otherwise
strongly
in
favour
of
the
argument
,
that
some
brute
animal
be
endue
with
Reason
;
and
the
team
have
capitulate
and
return
to
their
duty
.
   
<EOS>
with
droop
head
and
tremulous
tail
,
they
mash
their
way
through
the
thick
mud
,
flounder
and
stumble
between
while
,
as
if
they
be
fall
to
piece
at
the
large
joint
.
 
<EOS>
as
often
as
the
driver
rest
them
and
bring
them
to
a
stand
,
with
a
wary
"
Wo
-
ho
!
<EOS>
so
-
ho
then
!
<EOS>
"
the
near
leader
violently
shake
his
head
and
everything
upon
it
---
like
an
unusually
emphatic
horse
,
deny
that
the
coach
could
be
get
up
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
the
leader
make
this
rattle
,
the
passenger
start
,
as
a
nervous
passenger
might
,
and
be
disturb
in
mind
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
steam
mist
in
all
the
hollow
,
and
it
have
roam
in
its
forlornness
up
the
hill
,
like
an
evil
spirit
,
seek
rest
and
find
none
.
 
<EOS>
a
clammy
and
intensely
cold
mist
,
it
make
its
slow
way
through
the
air
in
ripple
that
visibly
follow
and
overspread
one
another
,
as
the
wave
of
an
unwholesome
sea
may
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dense
enough
to
shut
out
everything
from
the
light
of
the
coach
-
lamp
<EOS>
but
these
its
own
working
,
and
a
few
yard
of
road
;
and
the
reek
of
the
labour
horse
steam
into
it
,
as
if
they
have
make
it
all
.
   
<EOS>
two
other
passenger
,
besides
the
one
,
be
plod
up
the
hill
by
the
side
of
the
mail
.
 
<EOS>
all
three
be
wrap
to
the
cheekbone
and
over
the
ear
,
and
wear
jack
-
boot
.
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
three
could
have
say
,
from
anything
he
see
,
what
either
of
the
other
two
be
like
;
and
each
be
hide
under
almost
as
many
wrapper
from
the
eye
of
the
mind
,
as
from
the
eye
of
the
body
,
of
his
two
companion
.
 
<EOS>
in
those
day
,
traveller
be
very
shy
of
be
confidential
on
a
short
notice
,
for
anybody
on
the
road
may
be
a
robber
or
in
league
with
robber
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
latter
,
when
every
post
-
house
and
ale
-
house
could
produce
somebody
in
"
the
Captain
's
"
pay
,
range
from
the
landlord
to
the
low
stable
non
-
descript
,
it
be
the
likeliest
thing
upon
the
card
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
guard
of
the
Dover
mail
think
to
himself
,
that
Friday
night
in
November
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
,
lumber
up
Shooter
's
Hill
,
as
he
stand
on
his
own
particular
perch
behind
the
mail
,
beat
his
foot
,
and
keep
an
eye
and
a
hand
on
the
arm
-
chest
before
him
,
where
a
load
blunderbuss
lie
at
the
top
of
six
or
eight
loaded
horse
-
pistol
,
deposit
on
a
substratum
of
cutlass
.
   
<EOS>
the
Dover
mail
be
in
its
usual
genial
position
that
the
guard
suspect
the
passenger
,
the
passenger
suspect
one
another
and
the
guard
,
they
all
suspect
everybody
else
,
and
the
coachman
be
sure
of
nothing
but
the
horse
;
as
to
which
cattle
he
could
with
a
clear
conscience
have
take
his
oath
on
the
two
testament
that
they
be
not
fit
for
the
journey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Wo

ho

"
say
the
coachman
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
one
more
pull
<EOS>
and
you
be
at
the
top
and
be
damned
to
you

for
I
have
have
trouble
enough

you
to
it

"
Halloa

<EOS>
Tst

<EOS>
Yah

<EOS>
get
on
with
you

"
   
<EOS>
the
emphatic
horse
,
cut
short
by
the
whip
in
a
most
decide
negative
,
make
a
decide
scramble
for
it
,
and
the
three
other
horse
follow
suit
.
 
<EOS>
once
more
,
the
Dover
mail
struggle
on
,
with
the
jack
-
boot
of
its
passenger
squash
along
by
its
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
stop
when
the
coach
stop
,
and
they
keep
close
company
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
one
of
the
three
have
have
the
hardihood
to
propose
to
another
to
walk
on
a
little
ahead
into
the
mist
and
darkness
,
he
would
have
put
himself
in
a
fair
way
of
get
shoot
instantly
as
a
highwayman
.
   
<EOS>
the
last
burst
carry
the
mail
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
the
horse
stop
to
breathe
again
,
and
the
guard
get
down
to
skid
the
wheel
for
the
descent
,
and
open
the
coach

door
to
let
the
passenger
in

<EOS>
"

cry
the
coachman
in
a
warning
voice

look
down

box

<EOS>
"
what
do

say
,
Tom

<EOS>
They
both

,
leave
his

nimbly
to
his

<EOS>
"
gentleman

<EOS>
in
the
king

all
of
you

"
   
<EOS>
with
this
hurried
adjuration
,
he
cock
his
blunderbuss
,
and
stand
on
the
offensive
.
   
<EOS>
the
passenger
book
by
this
history
,
be
on
the
coach

step
,
get
in
;
the
two
other
passenger
be
close
behind
him

and
about
to
follow

<EOS>
He
remain
on

step
,
half
in

coach
and
half
out
of

they
re

in

road
below
him

<EOS>
They
all
look
from
the
coachman
to
the
guard
,
and
from
the
guard
to
the
coachman
,
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
the
coachman
look
back
and
the
guard
look
back
,
and
even
the
emphatic
leader
prick
up
his
ear
and
look
back
,
without
contradict
.
   
<EOS>
the
stillness
consequent
on
the
cessation
of
the
rumbling
and
and
labour
of
the
coach
,
add
to
the
stillness
of
the
night
,
make
it
very
quiet
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
the
panting
of
the
horse
communicate
a
tremulous
motion
to
the
coach
,
as
if
it
be
in
a
state
of
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
the
heart
of
the
passenger
beat
loud
enough
perhaps
to
be
hear
;
but
at
any
rate
,
the
quiet
pause

<EOS>
the
Night
<EOS>
Shadows
 
<EOS>
a
wonderful
fact
to
reflect
upon
,
that
every
human
creature
be
constitute
to
be
that
profound
secret
and
mystery
to
every
other
.
<EOS>
a
solemn
consideration
,
when
I
enter
a
great
city
by
night
,
that
every
one
of
those
darkly
clustered
house
enclose
its
own
secret
;
that
every
room
in
every
one
of
them
enclose
its
own
secret
;
that
every
beat
heart
in
the
hundred
of
thousand
of
breast
there
,
be
,
in
some
of
its
imagining
,
a
secret
to
the
heart
nearest
it
!
<EOS>
something
of
the
awfulness
,
even
of
death
itself
,
be
referable
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
no
more
can
I
turn
the
leave
of
this
dear
book
that
I
love
,
and
vainly
hope
in
time
to
read
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
no
more
can
I
look
into
the
depth
of
this
unfathomable
water
,
wherein
,
as
momentary
light
glance
into
it
<EOS>
,
I
have
have
glimpse
of
bury
treasure
and
other
thing
submerge
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
appoint
that
the
book
should
shut
with
a
a
spring
,
for
ever
and
for
ever
,
when
I
have
read
but
a
page
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
appoint
that
the
water
should
be
lock
in
an
eternal
frost
,
when
the
light
be
play
on
its
surface
,
and
I
stand
in
ignorance
on
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
be
dead
,
my
neighbour
be
dead
,
my
love
,
the
darling
of
my
soul
,
be
dead
;
it
be
the
inexorable
consolidation
and
perpetuation
of
the
secret
that
be
always
in
that
individuality

and
which
I
shall
carry
in
mine
to
my
life

<EOS>
in
any
of
the
burial

place
of
this
city
through
which
I
pass

be
there
a

more
inscrutable
than

in

than
I
be

<EOS>
as
to
this
,
his
natural
and
not

be
alienated
inheritance
,
the
messenger
on
horseback
have
exactly
the

possession
as
the
King

the

Minister

rich
merchant
in
London

<EOS>
so
with
the
three
passenger
shut
up
in
the
narrow
compass
of
one
lumber
old
mail
coach
;
they
be
mystery
to
one
another
,
as
complete
as
if
each
have
be
in
his
own
coach
and
six
,
or
his
own
coach

sixty
,
with
the
breadth
of
a
county
between
him
and

next
.
   
<EOS>
the
messenger
ride
back
at
an
easy
trot
,
stop
pretty
often
at
ale
-
house
by
the
way
to
drink
,
but
evince
a
tendency
to
keep
his
own
counsel
,
and
to
keep
his
hat
cock
over
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
eye
that
assort
very
well
with
that
decoration
,
be
of
a
surface
black
,
with
no
depth
in
the
colour
or
form
,
and
much
too
near
together
---
as
if
they
be
afraid
of
be
find
out
in
something
,
singly
,
if
they
keep
too
far
apart
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
sinister
expression
,
under
an
old
cock
-
hat
like
a
three
-
corner
spittoon
,
and
over
a
great
muffler
for
the
chin
and
throat
,
which
descend
nearly
to
the
wearer
's
knee
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
stop
for
drink
,
he
move
this
muffler
with
his
left
hand
,
only
while
he
pour
his
liquor
in
with
his
right
;
as
soon
as
that
be
do

he
muffle
again
.

"
no

harp
on

bust
me
if
I

<EOS>
His
message
perplex
his
mind
to
that
degree
that
he
be
fain
,
several
time
,
to
take
off
his
hat
to
scratch
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
except
on
the
crown
,
which
be
raggedly
bald
,
he
have
stiff
,
black
hair
,
stand
jaggedly
all
over
it
,
and
grow
down
hill
almost
to
his
broad
,
blunt
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
like
Smith
's
work
,
so
much
more
like
the
top
of
a
strongly
spiked
wall
than
a
head
of
hair
,
that
the
good
of
player
at
leap

frog
may
have
decline
him
,
as
the
most
dangerous
man
in
the
world
to
go
over
.

while
he
trot
back

be

night
watchman

door
of
Tellson

by

who
be

deliver
it

great
authority
within

the
shadow
of
the
night
take
such
shape

him

arise
out
of
the
message
,

take
such
shape
to
the
mare
as
arise
out
of
HER
private
topic
of
uneasiness

They
seem
to
be
numerous

for
she
shy
at
every
shadow
on
the
road

what
time

the

jolted

upon

tedious
way

with
its
three

to
whom
,
likewise
,
the
shadow
of
the
night
reveal
themselves
,
in
the
form
their

<EOS>
Tellson

Bank
have
a
run
upon
it
in

<EOS>
as
the

passenger

with
an

keep
him
from

against

into

whenever

nod
in

,
with
half

shut
eye
,
the
little

and
the

lamp
dimly
gleam
through
them

and
the
bulky
bundle
of
opposite

become
the
bank
,
and
do
a
great
stroke
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
the
rattle

the
chink

more

,
though
the

almost
always
with
him
,
and
though
the
coach
(
in
a
confused
way
,
like
the
presence
of
pain
under
an
opiate
)
be
always
with
him

there
be
another
current
of
impression
that
never

all
through

He
be
on

but
they
be
all
the
face
of
a
man
of
five
-
and
-
forty

year
,
and
they
differ
principally
in
the
passion
they
express
,
and
in
the
ghastliness
of
their
wear

waste
state

<EOS>
pride

prematurely
white

<EOS>
a
hundred
time
the
doze
passenger
inquire
of
this
spectre
:
   
<EOS>
"

long

"
   
<EOS>
the
answer
be
always
the

:

<EOS>
the
answer
to
this
question
be
various
and
contradictory

<EOS>
sometimes
the
broken
reply
be
,
"

<EOS>
It
would
kill
me
if
I
see
her

in

tender
rain
of

then
it
be

"

after

Shoemaker
 
"
good

say
Monsieur

look
down
at
the
white
head

bend
low
over
the
shoemaking

<EOS>
It
be
raise
for
a
moment
,
and
a
very
faint
voice
respond
to
the
salutation
,
as
if
it

at
a
distance
:
   
<EOS>
"
good
day

after
a
long
silence
,
the
head

lift
for
another
moment

and
the
voice
reply
,
"
yes
---
I
be
work

"
 
<EOS>
this
time
,
a
pair
of
haggard
eye
have
look
at
the
questioner
,
before
the
face
have
drop
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
faintness
of
the
voice
be
pitiable
and
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
faintness
of
physical
weakness
,
though
confinement
and
hard
fare
<EOS>
no
doubt
have
their
part
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Its
deplorable
peculiarity
be
,
that
it
be
the
faintness
of
solitude
and
disuse
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
last
feeble
echo
of
a
sound
make
long
and
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
so
entirely
have
it
lose
the
life
and
resonance
of
the
human
voice
,
that
it
affect
the
sense
like
a
once
beautiful
colour
fade
away
into
a
poor
weak
stain
.
 
<EOS>
so
sink
and
suppress
it
be
,
that
it
be
like
a
voice
underground
.
 
<EOS>
so
expressive
it
be
,
of
a
hopeless
and
lost
creature
,
that
a
famished
traveller
,
weary
out
by
lonely
wander
in
a
wilderness
,
would
have
remember
home
and
friend
in
such
a
tone
before
lie
down
to
die
.
   
<EOS>
some
minute
of
silent
work
have
pass
:
 
and
the
haggard
eye
have
look
up
again
:
 
not
with
any
interest
or
curiosity
,
but
with
a
dull
mechanical
perception
,
beforehand
,
that
the
spot
where
the
only
visitor
they
be
aware
of
have
stand

be
not

empty

"

in

here

<EOS>
You
can
bear
a

more
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
shoemaker
stop
his
work
;
look
with
a
vacant
air
of
listening
,
at
the
floor
on
one
side
of
him
;
then
similarly
,
at
the
floor
on
the
other
side
of
him
;
then
,
upward
at
the
speaker
.
   
<EOS>
"
what

you

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
bear
it

if

"
 
<EOS>
(
lay
the
palest
shadow
of
a
stress
upon
the
second
word

)
   
<EOS>
the
open
half
-
door
be
open
a
little
further
,
and
secure
at
that
angle
for
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
a
broad
ray
of
light
fall
into
the
garret
,
and
show
the
workman
with
an
unfinished
shoe
upon
his
lap
,
pause
in
his
labour
.
 
<EOS>
His
few
common
tool
and
various
scrap
of
leather
be
at
his
foot
and
on
his
bench
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
white
beard
,
raggedly
cut
,
but
not
very
long
,
a
hollow
face
,
and
exceedingly
bright
eye
.
 
<EOS>
the
hollowness
and
thinness
of
his
face
would
have
cause
them
to
look
large
,
under
his
yet
dark
eyebrow
and
his
confused
white
hair
,
though
they
have
be
really
otherwise
;
but
,
they
be
naturally
large
,
and
look
unnaturally
so
.
 
<EOS>
His
yellow
rag
of
shirt
lie
open
at
the
throat
,
and
show
his
body
to
be
wither
and
wear
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
and
his
old
canvas
frock
,
and
his
loose
stocking
,
and
all
his
poor
tatter
of
clothe
,
have
,
in
a
long
seclusion
from
direct
light
and
air
,
fade
down
to
such
a
dull
uniformity
of
parchment
-
yellow
,
that
it
would
have
be
hard
to
say
which
be
which
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
put
up
a
hand
between
his
eye
and
the
light
,
and
the
very
bone
of
it
seem
transparent
.

point

off

less
and
less
attentively

his
eye
in
gloomy
abstraction
seek
the
ground

finally
,
with

from

wall

garret

very
near
to
the
bench
on

<EOS>
there
be
something
awful
in
his
unconsciousness
of
the
figure
that
could
have
put
out
its
hand
and
touch
him
as
he
stoop
over
his
labour

motion
of
her
hand

of
his
striking
at
her
with

He
stare
at
her
with
a
fearful
look
,
and
after
a
while
his
lip
begin
to
form
some
word
,
though
no
sound
proceed
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
in
the
pause
of
his
quick
and
laboured
breathing
,
he
be
hear
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
this

"
   
<EOS>
with
the
tear
stream
down
her
face
,
she
put
her
two
hand
to
her
lip
,
and
kiss
them
to
him
;
then
clasp
them
on
her
breast

his
ruined
head
there

bench
beside
him

<EOS>
He
recoil
,
but
she
lay
her
hand
upon
his
arm

<EOS>
a
strange
thrill
strike
him
when
she
do
so
,
and
visibly
pass
over
his
frame
;
he
lay
the
knife
down
'
softly
,
as

Her
golden
hair

by
little
and
little

in
the
midst
of
the
action
he
go
astray
,

,
with
another
deep
sigh
,
fall
to
work
at
his
shoemaking
.
   
<EOS>
but
not
for
long
.
 
<EOS>
release
his
arm
,
she
lay
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
after
look
doubtfully
at
it
,
two
or
three
time
,
as
if
to
be
sure
that
it
be
really
there
,
he
lay
down
his
work
,
put
his
hand
to
his
neck

and
take
off
a
blacken
string
with
a
scrap
of

He
open
this

carefully
,
on
his
knee

and
it
contain
a
very
little
quantity
of
hair
:
 
not
more
than
one
or
two
long
golden
hair
,
which
he
have
,
in
some
old
day
,
wind
off
upon
his
finger

He
take
her
hair
into

<EOS>
as
the
concentrated
expression
return
to
his
forehead
,
he
seem
to
become
conscious
that
it
be
in
hers
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
her
full
to
the
light
,
and
look
at

no

he
be
so
confused

so
very
slow
to

that
they
take
fright
at

invariably
turn
to
it
when
she
speak

<EOS>
in

submissive
way

long
accustom

he
eat

drank
what

give
him
to
eat

cloak

He
readily
respond

They

off

It

for

rest

the
Old

be
famous
as

deadly
inn

yard

from
which
pale
traveller
set
out
continually
,
in
cart

coach
,
on
a
violent
passage
into
the
other
world

traverse
some
two
mile

a
half

road

punishment

no

altogether

the

at

be
a
choice
illustration
of
the
precept

that

an
aphorism
that

be
as
final
as
it

make

find

He

quiet
and
attentive
;
watch
the
opening
proceeding
with
a
grave
interest
;
and
stand
with
his
hand
rest
on
the
slab
of
wood
before
him
,
so
composedly
,
that
they
have
not
displace
a

of
the

with
which
it

<EOS>
the

be
all
bestrew
with
herb
and
sprinkle
with
vinegar
,
as
a
precaution
against
gaol
air
and

<EOS>
over
the
prisoner

head
there
be
a
mirror

to

the

down
upon
him

<EOS>
haunt
in
a
most
ghastly
manner
that
abominable
place
would
have
be
,
if
the
glass
could
ever
have
render
back
its
reflection
,
as
the
ocean
be
one
day
to
give
up
its

<EOS>
some
pass
thought
of
the
infamy
and
disgrace
for
which
it
have
be
reserve
,
may
have
strike
the
prisoner
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
a
change
in
his
position
make
him
conscious
of
a
bar
of
light
across
his
face
,
he
look
up
;
and
when
he
see
the
glass
his
face
flush
,
and
his
right
hand
push
the
herb
away
.
   
<EOS>
It
happen

that
the
action
turn
his
face
to
that
side
of
the
court
which
be
on
his
left
.
 
<EOS>
about
on
a
level
with
his
eye
<EOS>
,
there
sit
,
in
that
corner
of
the
Judge

bench
,
two
person
upon
whom
his
look
immediately
rest
;
so
immediately
,
and
so
much
to
the
changing
of
his
aspect
,
that
all
the
eye
that
be
tame
upon
him
,
turn
to
them
.
   
<EOS>
the
spectator
see
in
the
two
figure
,
a
young
lady
of
little
more
than
twenty
,
and
a
gentleman
who
be
evidently
her
father
;
a
man
of
a
very
remarkable
appearance
in
respect
of
the
absolute
whiteness
of
his
hair
,
and
a
certain
indescribable
intensity
of
face
:
 
not
of
an
active
kind
,
but
pondering
and
self
-
communing
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
expression
be
upon
him
,
he
look
as
if
he
be
old
;
but
when
it
be
stir
and
break
up
---
as
it
be
now
,
in
a
moment
,
on
his
speaking
to
his
daughter
---
he
become
a
handsome
man
,
not
past
the
prime
of
life
.
   
<EOS>
His
daughter
have
one
of
her
hand
draw
through
his
arm
,
as
she
sit
by
him

and
the
other
press
upon
it

<EOS>
She
have
draw
close
to
him
,
in
her
dread
of
the
scene
,
and
in
her
pity
for
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Her
forehead
have
be
strikingly
expressive
of
an
engrossing
terror
and
compassion
that
see
nothing
but
the
peril
of
the
accuse

<EOS>
this
have

very

very
powerfully
and
naturally
show

that
starer

Chapter

<EOS>
a
disappointment
 
Mr
Attorney
-
General
have
to
inform
the
jury
,
that
the
prisoner
before
them
,
though
young
in
year
,
be
old
in
the
treasonable
practice
which
claim
the
forfeit
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
that
this
correspondence
with
the
public
enemy
be
not
a
correspondence
of
to
-
day
,
or
of
yesterday
,
or
even
of
last
year
,
or
of
the
year
before
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
it
be
certain
the
prisoner
have
,
for
long
than
that
,
be
in
the
habit
of
pass
and
repasse
between
France
and
England
,
on
secret
business
of
which
he
could
give
no
honest
account
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
if
it
be
in
the
nature
of
traitorous
way
to
thrive
(
which
happily
it
never
be
)
,
the
real
wickedness
and
guilt
of
his
business
may
have
remain
undiscovered
.
<EOS>
that
Providence
,
however
,
have
put
it
into
the
heart
of
a
person
who
be
beyond
fear
and
beyond
reproach
,
to
ferret
out
the
nature
of
the
prisoner
's
scheme
,
and
,
strike
with
horror
,
to
disclose
them
to
his
Majesty
's
Chief
Secretary
of
State
and
most
honourable
Privy
Council
.
<EOS>
that
,
this
patriot
would
be
produce
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
his
position
and
attitude
be
,
on
the
whole
,
sublime
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
he
have
be
the
prisoner
's
friend
,
but
,
at
once
in
an
auspicious
and
an
evil
hour
detect
his
infamy
,
have
resolve
to
immolate
the
traitor
he
could
no
longer
cherish
in
his
bosom
,
on
the
sacred
altar
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
that
,
if
statue
be
decree
in
Britain
,
as
in
ancient
Greece
and
Rome
,
to
public
benefactor
,
this
shine
citizen
would
assuredly
have
have
one
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
as
they
be
not
so
decree
,
he
probably
would
not
have
one
.
 
<EOS>
that
<EOS>
,
Virtue
,
as
have
be
observe
by
the
poet
(
in
many
passage
which
he
well
know
the
jury
would
have
,
word
for
word
,
at
the
tip
of
their
tongue
;
whereat
<EOS>
the
jury
's
countenance
display
a
guilty
consciousness
that
they
know
nothing
about
the
passage
)
,
be
in
a
manner
contagious
;
more
especially
the
bright
virtue
know
as
patriotism
,
or
love
of
country
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
the
lofty
example
of
this
immaculate
and
unimpeachable
witness
for
the
Crown
,
to
refer
to
whom
however
unworthily
be
an
honour
,
have
communicate
itself
to
the
prisoner
's
servant
,
and
have
engender
in
him
a
holy
determination
to
examine
his
master
's
table
-
drawer
and
pocket
,
and
secrete
his
paper
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
he
(
Mr
Attorney
-
General
)
be
prepared
to
hear
some
disparagement
attempt
of
this
admirable
servant
;
but
that
,
in
a
general
way
,
he
prefer
him
to
his
(
Mr
Attorney
-
General
's
)
brother
and
sister
,
and
honour
him
more
than
his
<EOS>
(
Mr
Attorney
-
General
's
)
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
that
<EOS>
,
he
call
with
confidence
on
the
jury
to
come
and
do
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
the
evidence
of
these
two
witness
,
couple
with
the
document
of
their
discovering
that
would
be
produce
,
would
show
the
prisoner
to
have
be
furnish
with
list
of
his
Majesty
's
force
,
and
of
their
disposition
and
preparation
,
both
by
sea
and
land
,
and
would
leave
no
doubt
that
he
have
habitually
convey
such
information
to
a
hostile
power
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
these
list
could
not
be
prove
to
be
in
the
prisoner
's
handwriting
;
but
that
it
be
all
the
same
;
that
,
indeed
,
it
be
rather
the
well
for
the
prosecution
,
as
show
the
prisoner
to
be
artful
in
his
precaution
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
the
proof
would
go
back
five
year
,
and
would
show
the
prisoner
already
engage
in
these
pernicious
mission
,
within
a
few
week
before
the
date
of
the
very
first
action
fight
between
the
british
troop
and
the
Americans
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
for
these
reason
,
the
jury
,
be
a
loyal
jury
<EOS>
(
as
he
know
they
be
)
,
and
be
a
responsible
jury
(
as
they
know
they
be
)
,
must
positively
find
the
prisoner
guilty
,
and
make
an
end
of
him
,
whether
they
like
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
they
never
could
lay
their
head
upon
their
pillow
;
that
,
they
never
could
tolerate
the
idea
of
their
wife
lay
their
head
upon
their
pillow
;
that
,
they
never
could
endure
the
notion
of
their
child
lay
their
head
upon
their
pillow
;
in
short
,
that
there
never
more
could
be
,
for
them
or
theirs
,
any
laying
of
head
upon
pillow
at
all
,
unless
the
prisoner
's
head
be
take
off
.
 
<EOS>
that
head
Mr
Attorney
-
General
conclude
by
demand
of
them
,
in
the
name
of
everything
he
could
think
of
with
a
round
turn
in
it
,
and
on
the
faith
of
his
solemn
asseveration
that
he
already
consider
the
prisoner
as
good
as
dead
and
go
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
Attorney
-
General
cease
,
a
buzz
arise
in
the
court
as
if
a
cloud
of
great
blue

fly
be
swarm
about
the
prisoner
,
in
anticipation
of
what
he
be
soon
to
become
.
 
<EOS>
when

the
unimpeachable
patriot

in
the

<EOS>
Mr

<EOS>
the
story
of
his

exactly
what
Mr

General
have
describe
it
to
be

perhaps
,
if
it

a

too
exactly

<EOS>
have
release
his
noble
bosom
of
its

he

He

take
service
with

in
good
faith
and
simplicity
,
four
year
ago

He

aboard
the
Calais
packet

if
he
want
a
handy
fellow

and
the

<EOS>
He
have
not
ask
the
prisoner
to
take
the
handy
fellow
as
an
act
of
charity
---
never

such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
to
have
suspicion

keep
an
eye

soon
afterwards

<EOS>
He

these
list
from
the
drawer
of
the
prisoner

<EOS>
He

He

He
love
his

and
have
give
information

He
have
never
be
suspect
of
steal
a
silver
tea

he
have
be
malign
respect
a
mustard

pot

but
it
turn
out
to
be
only
a
plated
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
know
the

eight
year

that
be
merely
a
coincidence

<EOS>
He
do
not
call
it
a

curious
coincidence
;
most

be
curious

<EOS>
neither

that
perhaps
George
Washington

gain
almost
as
great
a

George
the
Third

my
learned
friend
there
,
"
point
to
him
who
have
toss
the
paper
over
,
"
and
then
look
well
upon
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
how
say
you
?
 
<EOS>
be
they
very
like
each
other
?
"
   
<EOS>
allow
for
my
learned
friend
's
appearance
be
careless
and
slovenly
if
not
debauch
,
they
be
sufficiently
like
each
other
to
surprise
,
not
only
the
witness
,
but
everybody
present
,
when
they
be
thus
bring
into
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
be
pray
to
bid
my
learned
friend
<EOS>
lie
aside
his
wig
,
and
give
no
very
gracious
consent
,
the
likeness
become
much
more
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
inquire
of
Mr
Stryver
(
the
prisoner
's
counsel
)
,
whether
they
be
next
to
try
Mr
Carton
(
name
of
my
learned
friend
)
for
treason
?
 
<EOS>
but
,
Mr
Stryver
reply
to
my
Lord
,
no
;
but
he
would
ask
the
witness
to
tell
him
whether
what
happen
once
,
may
happen
twice
;
whether
he
would
have
be
so
confident
if
he
have
see
this
illustration
of
his
rashness
sooner
,
whether
he
would
be
so
confident
,
have
see
it
;
and
more
.
<EOS>
the
upshot
of
which
,
be
,
to
smash
this
witness
like
a
crockery
vessel
,
and
shiver
his
part
of
the
case
to
useless
lumber
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
have
by
this
time
take
quite
a
lunch
of
rust
off
his
finger
in
his
following
of
the
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
now
to
attend
while
Mr
Stryver
fit
the
prisoner
's
case
on
the
jury
,
like
a
compact
suit
of
clothe
;
show
them
how
the
patriot
,
Barsad
,
be
a
hire
spy
and
traitor
,
an
unblushe
trafficker
in
blood
,
and
one
of
the
great
scoundrel
upon
earth
since
accurse
Judas
---
which
he
certainly
do
look
rather
like
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
virtuous
servant
,
Cly
,
be
his
friend
and
partner
,
and
be
worthy
to
be
;
how
the
watchful
eye
of
those
forger
and
false
swearer
have
rest
on
the
prisoner
as
a
victim
,
because
some
family
affair
in
France
,
he
be
of
french
extraction
,
do
require
his
make
those
passage
across
the
Channel
---
though
what
those
affair
be
,
a
consideration
for
other
who
be
near
and
dear
to
him
,
forbid
him
,
even
for
his
life
,
to
disclose
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
evidence
that
have
be
warp
and
wrest
from
the
young
lady
,
whose
anguish
in
give
it
they
have
witness
,
come
to
nothing
,
involve
the
mere
little
innocent
gallantry
and
politeness
likely
to
pass
between
any
young
gentleman
and
young
lady
<EOS>
so
throw
together
;
---
with
the
exception
of
that
reference
to
George
Washington
,
which
be
altogether
too
extravagant
and
impossible
to
be
regard
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
monstrous
joke
.
 
<EOS>
how
it
would
be
a
weakness
in
the
government
to
break
down
in
this
attempt
to
practise
for
popularity
on
the
low
national
antipathy
and
fear
,
and
therefore
Mr
Attorney
-
General
have
make
the
most
of
it
;
how
,
nevertheless
,
it
rest
upon
nothing
,
save
that
vile
and
infamous
character
of
evidence
too
often
disfigure
such
case
,
and
of
which
the
State
Trials
of
this
country
be
full
.
<EOS>
but
,
there
my
Lord
interpose
(
with
as
grave
a
face
as
if
it
have
not
be
true
)
,
say
that
he
could
not
sit
upon
that
Bench
and
suffer
those
allusion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
then
call
his
few
witness
,
and
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
have
next
to
attend
while
Mr
Attorney
-
General
turn
the
whole
suit
of
clothe
<EOS>
Mr
Stryver
have
fit
on
the
jury
,
inside
out
;
show
how
Barsad
and
Cly
be
even
a
hundred
time
well
than
he
have
think
them
,
and
the
prisoner
a
hundred
time
bad
.
 
<EOS>
lastly
,
come
my
Lord
himself
,
turn
the
suit
of
clothe
,
now
inside
out
,
now
outside
in
,
but
on
the
whole
decidedly
trim
and
shape
them
into
grave
-
clothe
for
the
prisoner
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
the
jury
turn
to
consider
,
and
the
great
fly
swarm
again
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Carton
,
who
have
so
long
sit
look
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
,
change
neither
his
place
nor
his
attitude
,
even
in
this
excitement
.
<EOS>
while
his
team
friend
,
Mr
Stryver
,
mass
his
paper
before
him
,
whisper
with
those
who
sit
near
,
and
from
time
to
time
glance
anxiously
at
the
jury
;
while
all
the
spectator
move
more
or
less
,
and
group
themselves
anew
;
while
even
my
Lord
himself
arise
from
his
seat
,
and
slowly
pace
up
and
down
his
platform
,
not
unattende
by
a
suspicion
in
the
mind
of
the
audience
that
his
state
be
feverish
;
this
one
man
sit
lean
back
,
with
his
torn
gown
half
off
him
,
his
untidy
wig
put
on
just
as
it
have
happen
to
fight
on
his
head
after
its
removal
,
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
eye
on
the
ceiling
as
they
have
be
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
something
especially
reckless
in
his
demeanour
,
not
only
give
him
a
disreputable
look
,
but
so
diminish
the
strong
resemblance
he
undoubtedly
bear
to
the
prisoner
(
which
his
momentary
earnestness
,
when
they
be
compare
together
,
have
strengthen
)
,
<EOS>
that
many
of
the
looker
-
on
,
take
note
of
him
now
,
say
to
one
another
they
would
hardly
have
think
the
two
be
so
alike
.
<EOS>
Mr
Cruncher
make
the
observation
to
his
next
neighbour
,
and
add
,
"
I
would
hold
half
a
guinea
that
he
do
not
get
no
law
-
work
to
do
.
<EOS>
do
not
look
like
the
sort
of
one
to
get
any
,
do
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
yet
,
this
Mr
Carton
take
in
more
of
the
detail
of
the
scene
than
he
appear
to
take
in
;
for
now
,
when
Miss
Manette
's
head
drop
upon
her
father
's
breast
,
he
be
the
first
to
see
it
,
and
to
say
audibly
:
"
Officer
!
<EOS>
look
to
that
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
help
the
gentleman
to
take
her
out
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
she
will
fall
!
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
much
commiseration
for
her
as
she
be
remove
,
and
much
sympathy
with
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
evidently
be
a
great
distress
to
him
,
to
have
the
day
of
his
imprisonment
recall
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
show
strong
internal
agitation
when
he
be
question
,
and
that
ponder
or
brooding
look
which
make
him
old
,
have
be
upon
him
,
like
a
heavy
cloud
,
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
pass
out
,
the
jury
,
who
have
turn
back
and
pause
a
moment
,
speak
,
through
their
foreman
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
not
agree
,
and
wish
to
retire
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
(
perhaps
with
George
Washington
on
his
mind
)
show
some
surprise
that
they
be
not
agree
,
but
signify
his
pleasure
that
they
should
retire
under
watch
and
ward
,
and
retire
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
trial
have
last
all
day
,
and
the
lamp
in
the
court
be
now
be
light
.
 
<EOS>
It
begin
to
be
rumour
that
the
jury
would
be
out
a
long
while
.
 
<EOS>
the
spectator
drop
off
to
get
refreshment
,
and
the
prisoner
withdraw
to
the
back
of
the
dock
,
and
sit
down
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
,
who
have
go
out
when
the
young
lady
and
her
father
go
out
,
now
reappear
,
and
beckon
to
Jerry
:
 
who
,
in
the
slacken
interest
,
could
easily
get
near
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jerry
,
if
you
wish
to
take
something
to
eat
,
you
can

You

be

come
in

do
not

I
want
you
to
take
the
verdict
back

You

Jerry
have
just
enough
forehead
to
knuckle
,
and
he
knuckle
it
in
acknowedgment
of
this
communication

a
shilling

<EOS>
Mr
Carton
come
up
at
the
moment
,

touch
Mr
Lorry
on
the
arm

<EOS>
"
how
be
the
young

She

I
will
tell
the
prisoner

not

Mr

redden
as
if
he
be
conscious
of
have
debate
the
point
in
his

Mr
Carton
make
his
way
to
the
outside

bar

lie
in

direction

I

<EOS>
congratulatory
 
from
the
dimly
-
light
passage
of
the
court
,
the
last
sediment
of
the
human
stew
that
have
be
boil
there
all
day
,
be

off
,
when
Doctor
Manette

Lucie

Mr

gather
<EOS>
round
Mr
Charles
Darnay
---
just
release
---
congratulate
him
on
his
escape
from
death
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
difficult
by
a
far
bright
light
,
to
recognise
in
Doctor
Manette
,
intellectual
of
face
and
upright
of
bearing
,
the
shoemaker
of
the
garret
in
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
no
one
could
have
look
at
him
twice
,
without
look
again
:
 
even
though
the
opportunity
of
observation
have
not
extend
to
the
mournful
cadence
of
his
low
grave
voice
,
and
to
the
abstraction
that
overcloud
him
fitfully
,
without
any
apparent
reason
.
 
<EOS>
while
one
external
cause
,
and
that
a
reference
to
his
long
lingering
agony
,
would
always
---
as
on
the
trial
---
evoke
this
condition
from
the
depth
of
his
soul
<EOS>
,
it
be
also
in
its
nature
to
arise
of
itself
,
and
to
draw
a
gloom
over
him
,
as
incomprehensible
to
those
unacquainted
with
his
story
as
if
they
have
see
the
shadow
of
the
actual
Bastille
throw
upon
him
by
a
summer
sun
,
when
the
substance
be
three
hundred
mile
away
.
   
<EOS>
only
his
daughter
have
the
power
of
charm
this
black
brooding
from
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
the
golden
thread
that
unite
him
to
a
past
beyond
his
misery
,
and
to
a
present
beyond
his
misery
:
 
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
the
light
of
her
face
,
the
touch
of
her
hand
,
have
a
strong
beneficial
influence
with
him
almost
always
.
 
<EOS>
not
absolutely
always
,
for
she
could
recall
some
occasion
on
which
her
power
have
fail
;
but
they
be
few
and
slight
,
and
she
believe
them
over
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Darnay
have
kiss
her
hand
fervently
and
gratefully
,
and
have
turn
to
Mr
Stryver
,
whom
he
warmly
thank
.

Mr

a
man
of
little
more
than
thirty

twenty
year
old

he

stout
,
loud
,
red
,
bluff

and
free
from
any
drawback
of
delicacy

have
a
pushing
way
of

himself
(
morally

would

in

a
ridiculous
exaggeration

<EOS>
the

shoulder
itself
towards
the
visage
of
the
Lord

Justice

the
florid

of
Mr

burst
out

It
have
once
be
note
at

that
while
Mr

be
a
glib
man
,

an
unscrupulous

a

he
have

which
be
among
the
most
striking

of

a
remarkable

come
upon

the
great

however
late
at

Sydney

they
go

even
there
they
prolong
their
usual
orgy
late
into

Carton
be

to
be
see
at
broad

,
go
home
stealthily

unsteadily
to

<EOS>
at

it
begin
to
get
about

among

the

,
that
although
Sydney

would
never
be

he
be
an
amazingly
good
jackal

that
he
render
suit

May

<EOS>
here
again

<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
's
inquiry
into
Miss
Pross
's
personal
history
have
establish
the
fact
that
her
brother
Solomon
be
a
heartless
scoundrel
who
have
strip
her
of
everything
she
possess
,
as
a
stake
to
speculate
with
,
and
have
abandon
her
in
her
poverty
for
evermore
,
with
no
touch
of
compunction

<EOS>
Miss
Pross
's
fidelity
of
belief
in
Solomon
(
deduct
a
mere
trifle
for
this
slight
mistake
)
be
quite
a
serious
matter
with
Mr
Lorry
,
and
have
its
weight
in
his
good
opinion
of
her

<EOS>
"
as
we
happen
to
be
alone

,
when
they
have
get
back
to
the
drawing

room
and
have
sit
down
there
in
friendly
relation
,
"
let
me
ask
you

do
the

return
Miss

I

now

dull

<EOS>
Miss

inquire
,
with
placidity

<EOS>
rather
wish
his
modest
adjective
away

Mr

reply
,
"
no

no
,
no

<EOS>
surely
not

<EOS>
to
return
to
business

---
be
it
not
remarkable
that
Doctor
Manette
,
unquestionably
innocent
of
any
crane
as
we
be
all
well
assure
he
be
,
should
never
touch
upon
that
question
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
with
me
,
though
he
have
business
relation
with
me
many
year
ago
,
and
we
be
now
intimate
;
I
will
say
with
the
fair

he

devotedly
attach

who
be

devotedly
attach

<EOS>
believe
me
,
Miss

,
I
do
not
approach
the
topic
with
you
,
out
of
curiosity

out
of
zealous
interest

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
to

soften

the

the
apology

<EOS>
he
be
afraid

"
   
<EOS>
"
afraid
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
plain
enough
,
I
should
think
,
why
he
may
be

<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
besides
that
,
his
loss
of
himself
grow
out
of
it

<EOS>
not
know
how

lose

how

recover
himself

he
may
never

certain
of
not
lose
himself
again

<EOS>
that
alone
would
not
make
the

pleasant

I
should
think

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
profounder
remark
than
Mr

have
look
for
.
 
<EOS>
"
true
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
fearful
to
reflect
upon
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
a
doubt
lurk
in
my
mind
,
Miss
Pross
,
whether
it
be
good
for
Doctor
Manette
to
have
that
suppression
always
shut
up
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
this
doubt
and
the
uneasiness
it
sometimes
cause
me
that
have
lead
me
to
our
present
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
can
not
be
help
,
"
say
Miss

shake
her
head

<EOS>
"
touch
that
string

and
he
instantly
change
for
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
well
leave
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
must
leave
it
alone
,
like

no

<EOS>
sometimes
,
he
get
up
in
the
dead
of
the
night

and
will
be
hear
,
by
us
overhead
there
,
walk
up

<EOS>
Ladybird
have
learn

prison

<EOS>
She
hurry
to
him

they
go
on
together
,
walk
up

down

walk
up

down
,
until
he
be
compose
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
never
say
a
word
of
the
true
reason
of
his
restlessness
,
to
her
,
and
she
find
it
good
not
to
hint
at
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
in
silence
they
go
walk
up

down

walk
up

down
together

till
her
love

company
have
bring
him
to
himself

"
   
<EOS>
notwithstanding
Miss
Pross
's
denial
of
her
own
imagination
,
there
be
a
perception
of
the
pain
of
be
monotonously
haunt
by
one
sad
idea
,
in
her
repetition
of
the
phrase
,
walk
up

down

which
testify
to
her
possess
such
a
thing
.
   
<EOS>
the
corner
have
be
mention

a
wonderful
corner

echo

it

so
resoundingly

it
seem

though
the
very

that
weary
pacing

<EOS>
"
here

Miss

break
up
the
conference

"
and
now
we
shall
have
hundred

people
pretty
soon

<EOS>
It
be
such
a
curious
corner
in
its
acoustical
property
,
such
a
peculiar
ear
of
a
place

that
as
Mr
Lorry
stand
at
the
open
window

look
for
the
father

he
hear

he
fancy
they

not
only
would
the
echo
die
away

as
though
the
step
have
go

echo
of
other
step
that
never
come
would
be
hear
in
their
stead

would
die
away
for
good

<EOS>
He

man
of

sixty

handsomely
dressed

haughty
in
manner

and
with
a
face
like
a
fine
mask

<EOS>
a

reside
.
 
<EOS>
They
persist
in
change
colour
sometimes
,
and
they
would
be
occasionally
dilate
and
contract
by
something
like
a
faint
pulsation
;
then
,
they
give
a
look
of
treachery

and
cruelty
,
to
the
whole
countenance

<EOS>
examine
with
attention

its
capacity

<EOS>
not
many
people
have

with
him
at

reception

he
have
stand
in

apart

Monseigneur
may
have
be
warm
in

manner

<EOS>
It

under

rather
agreeable

His

man
bring
no
check
into
the
face

or
to
the
lip

of
the
master

<EOS>
the
complaint

make
itself
audible

even
in
that
deaf
city

dumb
age

that

in

narrow
street
without
footway
,
the
fierce
patrician
custom
of
hard
driving
endanger

maim
the
mere
vulgar

a
barbarous
manner

but

with
a
wild
rattle

not

the

but
for
the

He

<EOS>
in

as
he

exercise
of
his
other

for
the
Long
Vacation

<EOS>
after
some
mental
debating
of
the
point
,
he
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
get
all
the
preliminary
do
with
,
and
they
could
then
arrange
at
their
leisure
whether
he
should
give
her
his
hand
a
week
or
two
before
Michaelmas
Term
,
or
in

as
to
the
strength

he
have
not

it

clearly
see
his
way
to
the
verdict
.
 
<EOS>
argue
with
the
jury
on
substantial
worldly
ground
---
the
only
ground
ever
worth
take
into
account
<EOS>
---
it
be
a
plain
case

have
not

spot
in

He
call
himself

accordingly
,
Mr

inaugurate
the
Long
Vacation
with
a
formal
proposal

take
Miss
Manette
to

that

to
Ranelagh
;
that
unaccountably
fail

it
behove
him
to
present
himself
in
Soho
,
and
there
declare
his
noble
mind
.
   
<EOS>
towards

therefore
,

<EOS>
anybody
who
have
see
him
project
himself
into

yet
on
Saint

side
of

,
burst
in
his
full

along
the

jostlement
of

His

Young

he

so
frightened

that
he
make
off
again
,

never
stop

more
.
   
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
stop
then
,
for
anything
less
necessary
than
breath
,
it
be
a

one
highly

<EOS>
He
have

always
on

perhaps
take
his

<EOS>
---
it
be
a
pursuer
to
shun

It

an
inconsistent

he
dart
out

fearful

It

It

<EOS>
"
I
be
again
at
work
upon
the
hill
-
side
,
and
the
sun
be
again
about
to
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
collect
my
tool
to
descend
to
my
cottage
down
in
the
village
below
,
where
it
be
already
dark
,
when
I
raise
my
eye
,
and
see
come
over
the
hill
six
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
them
be
a
tall
man
with
his
arm
bind
---
tie
to
his
side
---
like
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
the
aid
of
his
indispensable
cap
,
he
represent
a
man
with
his
elbow
bind
fast
at
his
hip
,
with
cord
that
be
knot
behind
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
stand
aside
,
monsieur
,
by
my
heap
of
stone
,
to
see
the
soldier
and
their
prisoner
pass
(
for
it
be
a
solitary
road
,
that
,
where
any
spectacle
be
well
worth
look
at
)
,
and
at
first
,
as
they
approach
,
I
see
no
more
than
that
they
be
six
soldier
with
a
tall
man
bind
,
and
that
they
be
almost
black
to
my
sight
---
except
on
the
side
of
the
sun
go
to
bed
,
where
they
have
a
red
edge
,
monsieur
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
I
see
that
their
long
shadow
be
on
the
hollow
ridge
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
,
and
be
on
the
hill
above
it
,
and
be
like
the
shadow
of
giant
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
I
see
that
they
be
cover
with
dust
,
and
that
the
dust
move
with
them
as
they
come
,
tramp
,
tramp
!
 
<EOS>
but
when
they
advance
quite
near
to
me
,
I
recognise
the
tall
man
,
and
he
recognise
me
.
<EOS>
ah
,
but
he
would
be
well
content
to
precipitate
himself
over
the
hill
-
side
once
again
,
as
on
the
evening
when
he
and
I
first
encounter
,
close
to
the
same
spot
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
describe
it
as
if
he
be
there
,
and
it
be
evident
that
he
see
it
vividly
;
perhaps
he
have
not
see
much
in
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
show
the
soldier
that
I
recognise
the
tall
man
;
he
do
not
show
the
soldier
that
he
recognise
me
;
we
do
it
,
and
we
know
it
,
with
our
eye

<EOS>
"
come
on
!
"
say
the
chief
of
that
company
,
point
to
the
village
,
"
bring
him
fast
to
his
tomb
!

<EOS>
and
they
bring
him
faster
.
<EOS>
I
follow
.
 
<EOS>
His
arm
be
swell
because
of
be
bind
so
tight
,
his
wooden
shoe
be
large
and
clumsy
,
and
he
be
lame
.
 
<EOS>
because
he
be
lame
,
and
consequently
slow
,
they
drive
him
with
their
gun
---
like
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
imitate
the
action
of
a
man
's
be
impel
forward
by
the
butt
-
end
of
musket
.
   
<EOS>
"
as
they
descend
the
hill
like
madman
run
a
race
,
he
fall
.
<EOS>
They
laugh
and
pick
him
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
be
bleed
and
cover
with
dust
,
but
he
can
not
touch
it
;
thereupon
they
laugh
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
bring
him
into
the
village
;
all
the
village
run
to
look
;
they
take
him
past
the
mill
,
and
up
to
the
prison
;
all
the
village
see
the
prison
gate
open
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
and
swallow
him
---
like
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
open
his
mouth
as
wide
as
he
could
,
and
shut
it
with
a
sound
snap
of
his
tooth
.
 
<EOS>
observant
of
his
unwillingness
to
mar
the
effect
by
open
it
again

Defarge

morning

with

I
make
a
circuit

high
up

bloody

He
have
no

the
three
glance
darkly
at

another

dark
,
repressed

revengeful

listen
to

story
;
the
manner
of
all
of
them
,
while
it
be
secret
,
be
authoritative
too

<EOS>
They
have
the
air
of
a
rough
tribunal
;
Jacques
One
and
two
sit
on
the
old
pallet
-
bed
,
each
with
his
chin
rest
on

equally
intent

on

knee
behind
them
,
with
his
agitated
hand
always
glide
over
the
network

fine
nerve
about
his
mouth

nose
;
Defarge
stand
between

he
have
station

by
turn

He
remain
up
there
in

iron
cage
some
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
village
look
at
him
by
stealth
,
for
it
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
always
look
up
,
from
a
distance
,
at

down

dread

,
madame
sit
all
day
at
her
counter
,
so
expressly
unconscious
of
him

so
particularly
determined
not
to
perceive
that
his

there
have
any
connection
with
anything
below

that
he
shake
in
his

for

he
contend
with
himself
that
it
be
impossible
to
foresee
what
that
lady
may
pretend
next
;

he
feel
assured
that
if

should
take
it
into
her
brightly
ornamented
head
to
pretend
that
she
have
see
him
do
a
murder

afterwards

the
victim

infallibly
go
through

It
be
additionally
disconcert
to
have
madame

all
the

there

in

it

additionally
disconcert
yet
,
to
have
madame

afternoon

still
with

<EOS>
but
,
in

except
that
to
the
shrewd
glance
of
Mr

<EOS>
it
disclose
some
shadowy
indication
that
the
old
air
of
avoidance
and
dread
have
lately

like

He

They

It

It

that
Mr

He

may
have
be
expect
in
him
when

<EOS>
but
,
it

<EOS>
"

to
Miss

after
anxious

<EOS>
the
only
ray
of
hope
that
Mr

could
discover

be
,
that
he
sometimes
furtively
look
up
without

<EOS>
in
that

there
seem
a
faint
expression

curiosity

some

<EOS>
two
thing
at
once
impress
themselves
on
Mr

,
as
important
above
all

;
the
first
,
that
this
must
be
keep

the
second
,
that
it
must
be
keep
secret
from
all
who

<EOS>
in

with
Miss

immediate
step
towards
the
latter
precaution

out
that
the

and
require
a
few
day
of
complete

<EOS>
in

of
the
kind
deception

Miss

be
to
write
,
describe
his
have

away
professionally

these
measure

advisable
to
be
take
in

,
Mr

take
in
the
hope
of
his
come
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
should
happen
soon
,
he
keep
another
course
in
reserve
;
which
be
,
to
have
a
certain
opinion
that
he
think
the
good

on
the
doctor

case
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
hope
of
his
recovery
,
and
of
resort
to
this
third
course

render
practicable
,
Mr

resolve
to
watch
him
attentively
,
with
as
little
appearance
as
possible
of

so

<EOS>
He
therefore
make
arrangement
to
absent
himself
from
Tellson
's
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
and
take
his
post
by
the
window
in
the
same
room
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
not
long
in
discover
that
it
be
bad
than
useless
to
speak
to
him
,
since
,
on
be
press
,
he
become
worried
.
 
<EOS>
He
abandon
that
attempt
on
the
first
day
,
and
resolve
merely
to
keep
himself
always
before
him

as
a
silent
protest
against
the
delusion
into
which
he
have
fall
,
or
be
fail

<EOS>
He
remain
,
therefore

in

<EOS>
Doctor

that
first

until
it

work
on

half
an
hour
after
Mr

could
not
have

<EOS>
when

"
Will
you
go
out

<EOS>
He
look
down
at
the
floor
on
either
side
of
him
in
the
old
manner
,
look
up
in
the
old
manner

and
repeat
in
the
old
low
voice
:
   
"
out

<EOS>
"
yes
;
for
a
walk
with
me

why
not

"
   
<EOS>
He
make
no
effort
to
say
why
not
,
and
say
not
a
word
more
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Mr
Lorry
think
he
see
,
as
he
lean
forward
on
his
bench
in
the
dusk
,
with
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
head
in
his
hand
,
that
he
be
in
some
misty
way
ask
himself
,
"
why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
the
sagacity
of
the
man
of
business
perceive
an
advantage
here
,
and
determine
to
hold
it
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Pross
and
<EOS>
he
divide
the
night
into
two
watch
,
and
observe
him
at
interval
from
the
adjoining
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
pace
up
and
down
for
a
long
time
before
he
lie
down
;
but
,
when
he
do
finally
lay
himself
down
,
he
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
he
be
up
betime
,
and
go
straight
to
his
bench
and
to
work
.
   
<EOS>
on
this
second
day
,
Mr
Lorry
salute
him
cheerfully
by
his
name
,
and
speak
to
him
on
topic
that
have
be
of
late
familiar
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
return
no
reply
,
but
it
be
evident
that
he
hear
what
be
say
,
and
that
he
think
about
it
,
however
confusedly
.
 
<EOS>
this
encourage
Mr
Lorry
to
have
Miss
Pross
in
with
her
work
,
several
time
during
the
day
;
at
those
time
,
they
quietly
speak
of
Lucie
,
and
of
her
father
then
present
,
precisely
in
the
usual
manner
,
and
as
if
there
be
nothing
amiss
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
do
without
any
demonstrative
accompaniment
,
not
long
enough
,
or
often
enough
to
harass
him
;
and
it
lighten
Mr
Lorry
's
friendly
heart
to
believe
that
he
look
up
oftener
,
and
that
he
appear
to
be
stir
by
some
perception
of
inconsistency
surround
him
.
   
<EOS>
when
it
fall
dark
again
,
Mr
Lorry
ask
him
as
before
:
   
"
dear
doctor
,
will
you
go
out

"
   
<EOS>
as
before

"

<EOS>
"
yes

for
a
walk
with
me

<EOS>
why

"
   
<EOS>
this
time
,
Mr
Lorry
feign
to
go
out
when
he
could
extract
no
answer
from
him
,
and
,
after
remain
absent
for
an
hour

return

in

have
remove
to

have
sit

<EOS>
the
secret

and
Lucie

but
he
could
not

to
observe
that
the
shoemaker

whose

have
be
a
little
out
at
first
,
be
grow
dreadfully
skilful
,
and
that
he
have
never

so
intent
on
his
work

that

never
be

anxious
watching
<EOS>
,
Mr
Lorry
fall
asleep
at
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
tenth
morning
of
his
suspense
,
he
be
startle
by
the
shining
of
the
sun
into
the
room
where
a
heavy
slumber
have
overtake
him
when
it
be
dark
night
.
   
<EOS>
He
rub
his
eye
and
rouse
himself
;
but
he
doubt
,
when
he
have
do
so
,
whether
he
be
not
still
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
go
to
the
door
of
the
Doctor

room
and
look
in

he
perceive
that
the
shoemaker
's
bench
and
tool
be
put
aside
again
,
and
that
the
Doctor
himself
sit
read
at
the
window

<EOS>
He
be
in
his
usual
morning
dress
,
and
his
face
(
which
Mr
Lorry
could
distinctly
see
)
,
though
still
very
pale
,
be
calmly
studious
and
attentive
.
   
<EOS>
even
when
he
have
satisfy
himself
that
he
be
awake
,
Mr
Lorry
feel
giddily
uncertain
for
some
few
moment
whether
the
late
shoemaking
may
not
be
a
disturbed
dream
of
his
own
;
for
,
do
not
his
eye
show
him
his
friend
before
him
in
his
accustomed
clothing
and
aspect
,
and
employ
as
usual
;
and
be
there
any
sign
within
their
range
,
that
the
change
of
which
he
have
so
strong
an
impression
have
actually
happen
?
   
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
but
the
inquiry
of
his
first
confusion
and
astonishment
,
the
answer
be
obvious
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
impression
be
not
produce
by
a
real
corresponding
and
sufficient
cause
,
how
come
he
,
Jarvis
Lorry
,
there
?
<EOS>
how
come
he
to
have
fall
asleep
,
in
his
clothe
,
on
the
sofa
in
Doctor
Manette
's
consulting

room
,
and
to
be
debate
these
point
outside
the
Doctor

door
in
the
early

<EOS>
within
a

,
Miss
Pross
stand
whisper
at
his
side

<EOS>
if
he
have
have
any
particle

leave

her
talk
would
of
necessity
have
resolve
it
;
but
he
be
by
that
time
clear

headed
,
and
have
none

<EOS>
He
advise
that
they
should
let
the
time
go
by
until
the
regular
breakfast
-
hour
,
and
should
then
meet
the
Doctor
as
if
nothing
unusual
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
appear
to
be
in
his
customary
state
of
mind
,
Mr
Lorry
would
then
cautiously
proceed
to
seek
direction
and
guidance
from
the
opinion

in
his

so
anxious

Mr

<EOS>
the

breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
so
far
as
it
be
possible
to
comprehend
him
without
overstep
those
delicate
and
gradual
approach
which
Mr
Lorry
feel
to
be
the
only
safe
advance
,
he
at
first
suppose
that
his
daughter
's
marriage
have
take
place
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
an
incidental
allusion
,
purposely
throw
out
,
to
the

of
the

and
the

set
him

<EOS>
in

I
be
deeply

that

it
may

glance
at

troubled

listen
attentively

He
have
already

give
your

me
well

<EOS>
"

Mr

see
that

proceed

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Manette
,
it
be
the
case
of
an
old
and
a
prolong
shock
,
of
great
acuteness
and
severity
to
the
affection
,
the
feeling
,
the
---
<EOS>
the
---
as
you
express
it
---
the
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
case
of
a
shock
under
which
the
sufferer
be
bear
down
,
one
can
not
say
for
how
long
,
because
I
believe
he
can
not
calculate
the
time
himself
,
and
there
be
no
other
mean
of
get
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
case
of
a
shock
from
which
the
sufferer
recover
,
by
a
process
that
he
can
not
trace
himself
---
as
I
once
hear
him
publicly
relate
in
a
striking
manner
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
case
of
a
shock
from
which
he
have
recover
,
so
completely
,
as
to
be
a
highly
intelligent
man
,
capable
of
close
application
of
mind
,
and
great
exertion
of
body
,
and
of
constantly
make
fresh
addition
to
his
stock
of
knowledge
,
which
be
already
very
large
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
unfortunately
,
there
have
be
,
"
he
pause
and
take
a
deep
breath
---
"
a
slight
relapse
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
,
in
a
low
voice
,
ask
,
"
of
how
long
duration
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
nine
day

night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
it
show
itself
?
 
<EOS>
I
infer
,

glance
at
his
hand
again
,
"
in
the
resumption
of
some
old
pursuit
connect
with
the
shock
?

<EOS>
"
that
be
the
fact

"
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
do
you
ever

ask
the
Doctor
,
distinctly

collectedly

though
in

low
voice
,
"
engage
in
that
pursuit
originally

once

and
when

be
he
in
most
respect

in
all

as
he
be
then
?
"

I

in

<EOS>
"
You
speak

do
his

know

<EOS>
no

that
be
very
kind

that
be
very

<EOS>
Mr
Lorry
grasp
his
hand
in
return

neither

the
two

Mr

at
length

in
his
most
considerate

affectionate
way

"
I
be

I

could
put
me
on

I
may

do
so
much
;
unenlightened

pray

Mr

<EOS>
"
I

break
silence

effort

You

Would

He
try
to
prepare

himself
make
him

it

Would

Mr

look
desolately

be
of

professional
knowledge

to
many

he
do

much

not

It
may
be
the
character
of
his

may
be

in

natural
to
it

the

the
less
it

occupy
with
healthy

the
more
it
would
be
in
danger
of
turn
in

unhealthy
direction

may
have
observe
himself

make
the
discovery

You
be

it

itself

Doctor
Manette
with
the
firmness

self

conviction

that
anything

the
one
train
of
association
would
renew
it

<EOS>
I
think
that

henceforth

nothing

some
extraordinary
jarring
of
that
chord
could
renew
it

<EOS>
after
what
have
happen
,

after
his
recovery

I
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
any
such
violent
sounding
of
that
string
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
,

I
almost
believe
,
that
the
circumstance
likely
to
renew
it
be
exhausted

<EOS>
He
speak
with
the
diffidence
of
a
man
who
know
how
slight
a
thing
would
overset
the
delicate
organisation
of
the
mind
,
and
yet
with
the
confidence
of
a
man
who
have
slowly
win
his
assurance
out
of
personal
endurance

distress
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
his
friend
to
abate
that
confidence

<EOS>
He
profess
himself
more
relieved

encourage
than
he
really
be

approach
his
second

last
point

<EOS>
He
feel
it
to
be
the
most
difficult
of
all
;
but
,
remember
his
old
Sunday
morning
conversation
with
Miss
Pross
,

remember
what
he
have
see
in
the
last
nine
day

once
yearn

frightfully

become
more
practised

the
ingenuity

for
the
ingenuity

the
mental
torture

never

bear
the
thought

put
it
quite
out

his
reach

<EOS>
even
now

when
I
believe
he
be
more
hopeful
of
himself
than
he
have
ever
be

even
speak
of
himself
with
a
kind
of
confidence
,
the
idea
that
he
may
need
that
old
employment
,

not
find
it

give
him
a
sudden
sense

terror

a
Plea
 
<EOS>
when

in
habit

in
look

in
manner

there
be
a
certain
rugged
air
of
fidelity
about
him
,
which
be
new
to
the
observation
of
Charles
Darnay

He
watch
his
opportunity

take

aside
into

of
speak

him

you

you
doubt
it

ask
Stryver

tell
you
so

well

at

I
do
,

you
must
take
my

well
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
could
endure
to
have
such
a
worthless
fellow

and
a
fellow
of
such
indifferent
reputation

come

go
at
odd

I
should
ask
that
I
may
be
permit

come

go

that
I
may

regard

I

add

resemblance
I
detect

I
doubt

It
be
a
hundred

if
I
should
avail
myself
of
it
four

It
would
satisfy
me

I
dare
say

to
know

I
have
it

<EOS>

Will
you
try

<EOS>

that

They
shake
hand
upon

turn
away

within
a
minute
afterwards

he
be
,
to
all
outward
appearance

as
unsubstantial
as

<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,

in
the
course
of
an
evening
pass
with
Miss
Pross
,
the
doctor
,
and
Mr
Lorry
,
Charles
Darnay
make
some
mention
of
this
conversation
in
general
term
,
and
speak
of
Sydney
Carton
as
a
problem
of
carelessness
and
recklessness

<EOS>
He
speak
of
him
,
in
short
,
not
bitterly
or
mean
to
bear
hard
upon
him
,
but
as
anybody
may
who
see
him
as
he
show
himself
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
that
this
could
dwell
in
the
thought
of
his
fair
young
wife
;
but
,
when
he
afterwards
join
her
in

he
find
her
wait
for
him

lifting

indeed

with

put
aside

astounded

I

there

scarcely
a

I
be

She
look
so
beautiful

yes

<EOS>
like
the
mariner
in

stream
have
drive
him
within
the
influence
of

everything

faster

faster

more

more
steadily

to
the
terrible
attraction

His
latent
uneasiness
have
be
,
that
bad
aim
be
be
work
out
in
his
own
unhappy
land
by
bad
instrument

that
he
who
could
not
fail
to
know
that
he
be
well
than
they
,
be
not
there
,
try
to
do
something
to
stay
bloodshed

assert
the
claim
of
mercy

humanity
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
uneasiness
half
stifled
,
and
half
reproach
him
,
he
have
be
bring
to
the
pointed
comparison
of
himself
with
the
brave
old
gentleman
in
whom
duty
be
so
strong
;
upon
that
comparison
(
injurious
to
himself
)
have
instantly
follow
the
sneer
of
Monseigneur
,
which
have
sting
him
bitterly
,
and
those
of
Stryver
,
which
above
all
be
coarse
and
gall
,
for
old
reason
.
<EOS>
upon
those
,
have
follow
Gabelle
's
letter
:
 
the
appeal
of
an
innocent
prisoner

in
danger

death
,
to
his
justice
,
honour

and
good
name

yes

<EOS>
the
Loadstone
Rock

draw
him

he
must

he
strike
.

He
know
of
no
rock

he
see
hardly
any
danger

<EOS>
the
intention
with
which
he
have
do
what
he
have
do
,
even
although
he
have
leave
it
incomplete
,
present
it
before
him
in
an
aspect
that
would
be
gratefully
acknowledge
in
France
on
his
present
himself
to
assert
it
.

then
,
that
glorious
vision
of
do
good
,
which
be
so
often
the
sanguine
mirage
of
so
many
good
mind
,
arise
before
him

and
he
even
see
himself
in
the
illusion
with
some
influence
to
guide
this
rage
revolution
that
be
run
so
fearfully
wild
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
walk
to

fro
with
his

be
go

should
be
spare
the
pain

separation

her
father
,
always
reluctant
to
turn
his
thought
towards
the
dangerous
ground
of
old
,
should
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
step
,
as
a
step
take
,
and
not
in
the
balance
of
suspense
and
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
how
much
of
the
incompleteness
of
his
situation
be
referable
to
her
father
,
through
the
painful
anxiety
to
avoid
revive
old
association
of
France
in
his
mind
,
he
do
not
discuss
with
himself

that
circumstance
too

have
have
its
influence
in

<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
arrive

him
out

He

the

<EOS>
the
Shadow
 
one
of
the
first
consideration
which
arise
in
the
business
mind
of
Mr
Lorry
when
business
hour
come
round
,
be
this
:
---
that
he
have
no
right
<EOS>
to
imperil
Tellson
's
by
shelter
the
wife
of
an
emigrant
prisoner
under
the
Bank
roof
,
His
own
possession
,
safety
,
life
,
he
would
have
hazard
for
Lucie
and
her
child
,
without
a
moment
's
demur
;
but
the
great
trust
he
hold
be
not
his
own
,
and
as
to
that
business
charge
he
be
a
strict
man
of
business
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
,
his
mind
revert
to
Defarge
,
and
he
think
of
find
out
the
wine
-
shop
again
and
take
counsel
with
its
master
in
reference
to
the
safe
dwelling
-
place
in
the
distracted
state
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
same
consideration
that
suggest
him
,
repudiate
him
;
he
live
in
the
most
violent
quarter
,
and
doubtless
be
influential
there
,
and
deep
in
its
dangerous
working
.
   
<EOS>
Noon
come
,
and
the
Doctor
not

<EOS>
every
minute
's

tend
to
compromise
Tellson

<EOS>
,
Mr

advise
with
Lucie
.
<EOS>
She
say
that
her
father
have
speak
of
hire

a
short
term

quarter
,
near
the
Banking

house

<EOS>
as
there
be
no
business
objection
to
this
,

as
he
foresee
that
even
if
it
be
all
well
with
Charles
,
and
he
be
to
be
release
,
he
could
not
hope
to
leave
the

,
Mr

go
out
in
quest
of
such
a
lodging
,
and
find
a
suitable
one
,
high
up
in
a
remove
by

street
where
the
close
blind
in
all
the
other
window
of
a
high
melancholy
square
of

mark
deserted

<EOS>
to
this
lodging
he
at
once
remove
Lucie

her
child

Miss
Pross

give
them
what
comfort
he
could

and
much
more
than
he
have
himself

<EOS>
He
leave
Jerry

them

retain

his
own
occupation

<EOS>
a
disturbed

doleful

that

escort
him
carefully

catch
up

butchery
so
dreadful

have
cover
his
eye

,
and
swoon

a
misgiving

<EOS>
for
the
first
time
he
feel
that
in
that
sharp
fire
,
he
have
slowly
forge
the
iron
which
could
break
the
prison
door
of
his
daughter

husband
,
and
deliver
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
all
tend

<EOS>
as
my

I

to
him
to
have
be
stop
,
like
a
clock
,
for
so
many
year
,
and
then
set
go
again
with
an
energy
which
have
lie
dormant
during
the
cessation
of
its
usefulness
,
he
believe
.
   
<EOS>
great
thing
than
the

have
at
that

contend
with
,
would
have
yield
before

<EOS>
while

whose

be
with
all
degree
of
mankind

bond

free

rich

bad

he
use
his
personal

so
wisely

that
he
be
soon
the
inspect
physician
of
three
prison
,
and
among
them
of
La

.
 
<EOS>
He
could
now
assure
Lucie
that
her
husband
be
no
longer
confine
alone
,
but
be
mix
with
the
general
body
of
prisoner
;
he
see
her
husband
weekly
,
and
bring
sweet
message
to
her
,
straight
from
his
lip
;
sometimes
her
husband
himself
send
a
letter
to
her
(
though
never
by
the
Doctor
's
hand
)
,
but
she
be
not
permit

write
to
him
:
 
for
,
among
the
many
wild

prison

the
wildest
of
all
point
at
emigrant

be
know
to
have

<EOS>
this
new
life
of
the
Doctor

be
an
anxious
life
,
no
doubt
;
still
,
the
sagacious
Mr
Lorry
see
that
there
be
a
new
sustaining
pride
in
it
.
<EOS>
nothing
unbecoming
tinge
the
pride
;
it
be
a
natural
and
worthy
one
;
but
he
observe
it
as
a
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
the
Doctor
know
,
that
up
to
that
time
,
his
imprisonment
have
be
associate
in
the
mind
of
his
daughter
and
his

,
with
his
personal
affliction
,
deprivation
,
and
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
this
be
change
,
and
he
know
himself
to
be
invest
through
that
old
trial
with
force
to
which
they
both
look
for
Charles

ultimate
safety
and
deliverance
,
he
become
so
far
exalt
by
the
change
,
that
he
take
the
lead
and
direction
,
and
require
them
as
the
weak
,
to
trust
to
him
as
the
strong
.
 
<EOS>
the
precede
relative
position
of
himself
and
Lucie
be
reverse
,
yet
only
as
the
lively
gratitude
and
affection
could
reverse
them
,
for
he
could
have
have
no
pride

in
render
some
service
to
her
who
have
render
so
much
to

<EOS>
He

<EOS>

<EOS>
the

with
which

<EOS>
Doctor

<EOS>
His
high
personal
popularity
,
and
the
clearness
of
his
answer
,
make
a
great
impression
;
but
,
as
he
proceed
,
as
he
show
that
the
Accused

his
first
friend
on
his

from
his
long

;
that

the
accuse
have
remain
in
England
,
always
faithful

so

Aristocrat
government
there
,
he
have
actually
be
try
for
his
life
by

as
the
foe
of
England

friend
of
the
United

these
circumstance
into

,
with
the
great
discretion
and
with
the
straightforward
force
of
truth
and
earnestness
,
the
Jury
and
the
populace
become
one
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
he
appeal
by

to
Monsieur

,
an
english
gentleman
then
and
there
present
,
who
,
like
himself
,
have
be
a
witness
on
that
english
trial
and
could
corroborate
his
account
of
it
,
the
Jury
declare
that
they
have
hear
enough
,
and
that
they
be
ready
with
their
vote
if
the
President
be
content
to
receive
them
.
   
<EOS>
at
every
vote
(
the
Jurymen

aloud
and
individually
)
,
the
populace
set
up
a
shout
of
applause
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
voice
be
in
the
prisoner

favour
,
and
the
President

him
free

<EOS>
then
,
begin
one
of
those
extraordinary
scene
with
which
the
populace
sometimes
gratify
their
fickleness
,
or
their
well
impulse
towards
generosity
and
mercy
,
or
which
they
regard
as
some
set
-
off
against
their
swollen
account
of
cruel
rage
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
can
decide
now
to
which
of
these
motive
such
extraordinary
scene
be
referable
;
it
be
probable
,
to
a
blending
of
all
the
three
,
with
the
second
predominating

<EOS>
no
sooner
be
the
acquittal
pronounce

than
tear
be
shed
as
freely
as

and
such
fraternal
embrace
be
bestow
upon
the
prisoner
by
as
many
of
both

could
rush
at
him
,
that
after
his
long
and
unwholesome
confinement
he
be
in
danger
of
faint
from
exhaustion
;
none
the
less
because
he
know
very
well
,
that
the
very

carry
by
another
current
,
would
have
rush
at
him
with
the
very

intensity
,
to
rend
him
to
piece
and
strew
him
over
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
His
removal
,
to
make
way
for
other

person
who
be

rescue
him
from

for
the

<EOS>
five

be
try
together
,
next

as
enemy
of
the
Republic
,
forasmuch
as
they
have
not

it
by
word

<EOS>
so
quick
be
the
Tribunal
to
compensate
itself
and
the
nation
for
a
chance
lose
,
that
these
five
come
down
to
him
before
he
leave
the
place
,
condemn

within
twenty

four
hour

<EOS>
the
first
of
them

him
so
,
with
the
customary
prison
sign
of
death
---
a
raise
finger

and
they
all

,
"

"
   
<EOS>
the
five
have
have
,
it

for
when

there
be
a
great
crowd
about

in
which
there
seem

<EOS>
on
his

the
concourse
make
at

weep

and
shouting

all

tide
of
the
river
on

bank
of
which
the
mad
scene
be
act
,
seem
to
run
mad
,
like
the
people
on
the
shore

<EOS>
They
put
him
into
a
great
chair
they
have
among
them
,
and
which
they
have
take
either
out
of
the
Court
itself
,
or
one
of
its

or
passage

<EOS>
over

<EOS>
in

so

instantly

all

Her

because

partly
on

the

<EOS>
in
the

as
in
very
many
other

the

to
avoid
attract

desire

<EOS>
for
some

although
Miss

she
have
no

as
she
be

than
Mr

<EOS>
so
her
manner
of
marketing
be
to
plump
a
noun

substantive
at
the

of
a

without
any
introduction
in

,
if

she
want

She
always
make

the

"
She

any

I

She

I
be
glad

She

anxious

very
beautiful

"
   
<EOS>
"
ah

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
grieve
sound
,
like
a

almost
like

<EOS>
It
attract
Mr

swiftly
as
a

sweep
over

he
lift
his
foot
to
put
back
one

brown
hair

all
untrimmed

loose

<EOS>
His
indifference
to
fire
be
sufficiently
remarkable
to
elicit
a
word
of
remonstrance
from
Mr

his

still

I
know
what
Court

I
expect

never

of

,
I
wish
to
relieve
my

I
have
keep
the
matter
a
profound
secret
,
even
from
my

and
this
<EOS>
,
too
,
I
resolve
to
state
in
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
apprehension
whatever
of
my
real
danger
;

I
be
conscious
that
there
may
be
danger
for
other

if
other

compromise

possess
the
knowledge

I
possess

I
be
much
engage

night

herself
to
me

Marquis
St

lately

My

She
have
reason

Her
inducement

restore
him

they
each
put

all
that
have
happen
since
the
garret
time
be
a
momentary
fancy

Mr

see
him
shrink
into

exact

have
have
in

such
a
tone

up

now

take
this
paper

Manette

about

will
be

They
be
not
in
danger

<EOS>
"
They
be
in
great
danger

<EOS>
They
be
in
danger
of
denunciation
by
Madame
Defarge
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
from
her
own
lip
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
overhear
word
of
that
woman
's
,
to

night
,
which
have
present
their
danger
to
me
in
strong
colour

<EOS>
I
have
lose
no

since
then
,
I
have
see
the
spy

He
confirm
me

He
know
that
a
wood

by

prison
wall

under
the
control

he
never
mention
Lucie
's

make
sign
and
signal
to
prisoner

<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
foresee
that
the
pretence
will
be
the
common
one
,
a
prison
plot
,
and
that
it
will
involve
her
life
---
and
perhaps
her
child
's
---
and
perhaps
her
father
's
---
for
both
have
be
see
with
her

place

not

I

go

this

three

more

know
it

a
capital
crime

sympathise
with

Guillotine

She

be
guilty

this
crime

and
this
woman
(
the
inveteracy
of
whose
pursuit

would
wait
to
add

strength

You

You

in

the
doom
of

their

<EOS>
They
be
in
number
as

<EOS>
fifty
-
two
be
to

that
afternoon
on

tide
of

to
the
boundless
everlasting

<EOS>
before
their

be

of
them
,
new
occupant
be
appoint
;
before
their
blood
run
into
the

the

from
the

general
of
seventy

whose

could
not

to

physical

engender
in
the
vice
and
neglect

will
seize
on

of
all
degree
;
and
the
frightful
moral
disorder
,
bear
of
unspeakable
suffering
,
intolerable
oppression
,
and
heartless
indifference
,
smote
equally
without

.
   
<EOS>
Charles
Darnay
,
alone
in
a
cell
,
have
sustain
himself
with
no
flattering
delusion
since
he
come
to
it
from
the
Tribunal
.
<EOS>
in
every
line
of
the
narrative
he
have
hear
,
he
have
hear
his
condemnation
.
<EOS>
He
have
fully
comprehend
that
no
personal
influence
could
possibly
save
him
,
that
he
be
virtually
sentence
by
the
million
,
and
that
unit
could
avail
him
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
be
not
easy
,
with
the
face
of
his
beloved
wife
fresh
before
him
,
to
compose
his
mind
to
what
it
must
bear
.
 
<EOS>
His
hold
on
life
be
strong
,
and
it
be
very
,
very
hard
,
to
loosen
;
by
gradual
effort
and
degree
unclose
a
little
here
,
it
clench
the
tight
there
;
and
when
he
bring
his
strength
to
bear
on
that
hand
<EOS>
and
it
yield
,
this
be
close
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
hurry
,
too
,
in
all
his
thought
,
a
turbulent
and
heated
working
of
his
heart
,
that
contend
against
resignation
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
for
a
moment
,
he
do
feel
resign
,
then
his
wife
and
child
who
have
to
live
after
him
,
seem
to
protest
and
to
make
it
a
selfish
thing
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
all
this
be
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
before
long
,
the
consideration
that
there
be
no
disgrace
in
the
fate
he
must
meet
,
and
that
number
go
the
same
road
wrongfully
,
and
tread
it
firmly
every
day
,
spring
up
to
stimulate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Next
follow
the
thought
that
much
of
the
future
peace
of
mind
enjoyable
by
the
dear
one
,
depend
on
his
quiet
fortitude
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
by
degree
he
calm
into
the
well
state
,
when
he
could
raise
his
thought
much
high
,
and
draw
comfort
down
.
   
<EOS>
before
it
have
set
in
dark
on
the
night
of
his
condemnation
,
he
have
travel
thus
far
on
his
last
way
.
 
<EOS>
be
allow
to
purchase
the
mean
of
writing
,
and
a
light
,
he
sit
down
to
write
until
such
time
as
the
prison
lamp
should
be
extinguish
.
   
<EOS>
He
write
a
long
letter
to
Lucie
,
show
her
that
he
have
know
nothing
of
her
father
's
imprisonment
,
until
he
have
hear
of
it
from
herself
,
and
that
he
have
be
as
ignorant
as
she
of
his
father
's
and
uncle
's
responsibility
for
that
misery
,
until
the
paper
have
be
read
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
explain
to
her
that
his
concealment
from
herself
of
the
name
he
have
relinquish
,
be
the
one
condition
---
fully
intelligible
now
---
that
her
father
have
attach
to
their
betrothal
,
and
be
the
one
promise
he
have
still
exact
on
the
morning
of
their
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreat
her
,
for
her
father
's
sake
,
never
to
seek
to
know
whether
her
father
have
become
oblivious
of
the
existence
of
the
paper
,
or
have
have
it
recall
to
him
(
for
the
moment
,
or
for
good
)
,
by
the
story
of
the
Tower
,
on
that
old
Sunday
under
the
dear
old
plane
-
tree
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
preserve
any
definite
remembrance
of
it
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
have
suppose
it
destroy
with
the
Bastille
,
when
he
have
find
no
mention
of
it
among
the
relic
of
prisoner
which
the
populace
have
discover
there
,
and
which
have
be
describe
to
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
beseech
her
---
though
he
add
that
he
know
it
be
needless
---
to
console
her
father
,
by
impress
him
through
every
tender
<EOS>
mean
she
could
think
of
,
with
the
truth
that
he
have
do
nothing
for
which
he
could
justly
reproach
himself
,
but
have
uniformly
forget
himself
for
their
joint
sake
.
 
<EOS>
next
to
her
preservation
of
his
own
last
grateful
love
and
blessing
,
and
her
overcoming
of
her
sorrow
,
to
devote
herself
to
their
dear
child
,
he
adjure
her
,
as
they
would
meet
in
Heaven
,
to
comfort
her
father
.
   
<EOS>
to
her
father
himself
,
he
write
in
the
same
strain
;
but
,
he
tell
her
father
that
he
expressly
confide
his
wife
and
child
to
his
care
.
<EOS>
and
he
tell
him
this
,
very
strongly
,
with
the
hope
of
rouse
him
from
any
despondency
or
dangerous
retrospect
towards
which
he
foresee
he
may
be
tend
.
   
<EOS>
to
Mr
Lorry
,
he
commend
them
all
,
and
explain
his
worldly
affair
.
<EOS>
that
do
,
with
many
add
sentence
of
grateful
friendship
and
warm
attachment
,
all
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
think
of
Carton
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
be
so
full
of
the
other
,
that
he
never
once
think
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
time
to
finish
these
letter
before
the
light
be
put
out
.
<EOS>
when
he
lie
down
on
his
straw
bed
,
he
think
he
have
do
with
this
world
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
it
beckon
him
back
in
his
sleep
,
and
show
itself
in
shine
form
.
 
<EOS>
free
and
happy
<EOS>
,
back
in
the
old
house
in
Soho
(
though
it
have
nothing
in
it
like
the
real
house
)
,
unaccountably
release
and
light
of
heart
,
he
be
with
Lucie
again
,
and
she
tell
him
it
be
all
a
dream
,
and
he
have
never
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
a
pause
of
forgetfulness
,
and
then
he
have
even
suffer
,
and
have
come
back
to
her
,
dead
and
at
peace
,
and
yet
there
be
no
difference
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
another
pause
of
oblivion
,
and
he
awake
in
the
sombre
morning
,
unconscious
where
he
be
or
what
have
happen
,
until
it
flash
upon
his
mind
,
"
this
be
the
day
of
my
death
!
"
   
<EOS>
thus
,
have
he
come
through
the
hour
,
to
the
day
when
the
fifty
-
two
head
be
to
fall
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
while
he
be
compose
,
and
hope
that
he
could
meet
the
end
with
quiet
heroism
,
a
new
action
begin
in
his
wake
thought
,
which
be
very
difficult
to
master
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
never
see
the
instrument
that
be
to
terminate
his
life
.
<EOS>
how
high
it
be
from
the
ground
,
how
many
step
it
have
,
where
he
would
be
stand
,
bow
he
would
be
touch
,
whether
the
touching
hand
would
be
dye
red
,
which
way
his
face
would
be
turn
,
whether
he
would
be
the
first
,
or
may
be
the
last
:
 
these
and
many
similar
question
,
in
nowise
direct
by
his
will
,
obtrude
themselves
over
and
over
again
,
countless
time
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
they
connect
with
fear
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
conscious
of
no
fear
.
 
<EOS>
rather
,
they
originate
in
a
strange
besetting
desire
to
know
what
to
do
when
the
time
come
;
a
desire
gigantically
disproportionate
to
the
few
swift
moment
to
which
it
refer
;
a
wondering
that
be
more
like
the
wondering
of
some
other
spirit
within
his
,
than
his
own
.
   
<EOS>
the
hour
go
on
as
he
walk
to
and
fro
,
and
the
clock
strike
the
number
he
would
never
hear
again
.
 
<EOS>
nine
go
for
ever
<EOS>
,
ten
go
for
ever
,
eleven
go
for
ever
,
twelve
come
on
to
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
hard
contest
with
that
eccentric
action
of
thought
which
have
last
perplex
him
,
he
have
get
the
well
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
up
and
down
,
softly
repeat
their
name
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
of
the
strife
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
walk
up
and
down
,
free
from
distract
fancy
,
pray
for
himself
and
for
them
.
   
<EOS>
twelve
go
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
be
apprise
that
the
final
hour
be
three
,
and
be
know
he
would
be
summon
some
time
earlier
,
inasmuch
as
the
tumbril
jolt
heavily
and
slowly
through
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
he
resolve
to
keep
two
before
his
mind
,
as
the
hour
,
and
so
to
strengthen
himself
in
the
interval
that
he
may
be
able
,
after
that
time
,
to
strengthen
other
.
   
<EOS>
walk
regularly
to
and
fro
with
his
arm
fold
on
his
breast
,
a
very
different
man
from
the
prisoner
,
who
have
walk
to
and
fro
at
La
Force
,
he
hear
one
strike
away
from
him
,
without
surprise
.
<EOS>
the
hour
have
measure
like
most
other
hour
.
 
<EOS>
devoutly
thankful
to
Heaven
for
his
recovered
self
-
possession
,
he
think
,
"
there
be
but
another
now
,
"
and
turn
to
walk
again
.
   
<EOS>
footstep
in
the
stone
passage
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
.
   
<EOS>
the
key
be
put
in
the
lock
,
and
turn
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
door
be
open
,
or
as
it
open
,
a
man
say
in
a
low
voice
,
in
English
:
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
never
see
me
here
;
I
have
keep
out
of
his

.
 
<EOS>
go
you
in
alone
;
I
wait
near
.
<EOS>
lose
no
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
door
be
quickly
open
and
closed
,
and
there
stand
before
him
face
to
face
,
quiet
,
intent
upon
him
,
with
the
light
of
a
smile
on
his
feature
,
and
a
cautionary
finger
on
his
lip
,
Sydney
Carton
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
bright
and
remarkable
in
his
look
,
that
,
for
the
first
moment
,
the
prisoner
misdoubte
him
to
be
an
apparition
of
his
own
imagining
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
he
speak
,
and
it
be
his
voice
;
he
take
the
prisoner
's
hand
,
and
it
be
his
real
grasp
.
   
<EOS>
"
of
all
the
people
upon

you
least
expect
to
see
me

firmness

to

<EOS>
It

that

It

nothing
to

,
that
his

be
make
a
widow

his

an
orphan
;
that
be
insufficient
punishment
,
because
they
be
her
natural
enemy

as
such
have
no

<EOS>
to

if

in
any

the
many
encounter

she
would
not
have

nor

would
she

<EOS>
such

Madame

<EOS>
carelessly

,
it
be
a
become
robe
enough
,
in

certain
weird

<EOS>
thus
accoutre
,
and
walk
with
the
confident
tread
of
such
a
character
,

with
the
supple
freedom
of
a
woman
who

habitually
walk
in

girlhood
,
bare

and
bare

on

Madame

take
her
way
along
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
when
the
journey
of
the
travel
coach
,
at
that
very
moment
wait
for
the
completion
of
its
load
,
have
be
plan
out
last
night
,
the
difficulty
of
take
Miss
Pross
in
it
have
much
engage
Mr
Lorry
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
merely
desirable
to
avoid
overload
the
coach
,
but
it
be
of
the
high
importance
that
the
time
occupy
in
examine
it
and
its
passenger
,
should
be
reduce
to
the
utmost
;
since
their
escape
may
depend
on
the
saving
of
only
a
few
second
here
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
he
have
propose
,
after
anxious
   
consideration
,
that
Miss
Pross
and
Jerry
,
who
be
at
liberty
to
leave
the
city
,
should
leave
it
at
three
o'clock
in
the
lightest
-
wheel
conveyance
know
to
that
period
.
 
<EOS>
unencumbered
with
luggage
,
they
would
soon
overtake
the
coach
,
and
,
pass
it
and
precede
it
on
the
road
,
would
order
its
horse
in
advance
,
and
greatly
facilitate
its
progress
during
the
precious
hour
of
the
night
,
when
delay
be
the
most
to
be
dread
.
   
<EOS>
see
in
this
arrangement
the
hope
of
render
real
service
in
that
press
emergency
,
Miss
Pross
hail
it
with
joy
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
Jerry
have
behold
the
coach
start
,
have
know
who
it
be
that
Solomon
bring
,
<EOS>
have
pass
some
ten
minute
in
torture
of
suspense
,
and
be
now
conclude
their
arrangement
to
follow
the
coach
,
even
as
Madame
Defarge
,
take
her
way
through
the
street
,
now
draw
nearer
and
near
to
the
else

desert
lodging
in
which
they
hold
their
consultation
.
   
<EOS>
"

at
the
foot
of
the
same
scaffold
,
not
long
before
,
to
be
allow
to
write
down
the
thought
that
be
inspire
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
give
any
utterance
to
his
,
and
they
be
prophetic
,
they
would
have
be
these
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
Barsad
,
and
Cly
,
Defarge
,
the
Vengeance
,
the
Juryman
,
the
Judge
,
long
rank
of
the
new
oppressor
who
have
rise
on
the
destruction
of
the
old
,
perish
by
this
retributive
instrument
,
before
it
shall
cease
out
of
its
present
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
a
beautiful
city
and
a
brilliant
people
rise
from
this
abyss
,
and
,
in
their
struggle
to
be
truly
free
,
in
their
triumph
and
defeat
,
<EOS>
through
long
year
to
come
,
I
see
the
evil
of
this
time
and
of
the
previous
time
of
which
this
be
the
natural
birth
,
gradually
make
expiation
for
itself
and
wear
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
life
for
which
I
lie
down
my
life
,
peaceful
,
useful
,
prosperous
and
happy
,
in
that
England
which
I
shall
see
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
see
Her
with
a
child
upon
her
bosom
,
who
bear
my
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
father
,
aged
and
bent
,
but
otherwise
restore
,
and
faithful
to
all
man
in
his
healing
office
,
and
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
good
old
man
,
<EOS>
so
long
their
friend
,
in
ten
year
'
time
enrich
them
with
all
he
have
,
and
pass
tranquilly
to
his
reward
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
I
hold
a
sanctuary
in
their
heart
,
and
in
the
heart
of
their
descendant
,
generation
hence
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
,
an
old
woman
,
weep
for
me
on
the
anniversary
of
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
her
and
her
husband
,
their
course
do
,
lie
side
by
side
in
their
last
earthly
bed
,
and
I
know
that
each
be
not
more
honoured
and
hold
sacred
in
the
other
's
soul
,
than
I
be
in
the
soul
of
both
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
child
who
lie
upon
her
bosom
and
who
bear
my
name
,
a
man
win
his
way
up
in
that
path
of
life
which
once
be
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
win
it
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
my
name
be
make
illustrious
there
by
the
light
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
blot
I
throw
upon
it
,
fade
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
,
fore
-
most
of
just
judge
and
honour
man
,
bring
a
boy
of
my
name
,
with
a
forehead
that
I
know
and
golden
hair
,
to
this
place
---
then
fair
to
look
upon
,
with
not
a
trace
of
this
day
's
disfigurement
 
---
<EOS>
and
I
hear
him
tell
the
child
my
story
,
with
a
tender
and
a
falter
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
far
,
far
well
thing
that
I
do
,
than
I
have
ever
do
;
it
be
a
far
,
far
well
rest
that
I
go
to
than
I
have
ever
know
.
