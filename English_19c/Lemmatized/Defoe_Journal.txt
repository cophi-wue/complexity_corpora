It
be
about
the
beginning
of
September
,
1664
,
that
I
,
among
the
rest
of
my
neighbour
,
hear
in
ordinary
discourse
that
the
plague
be
return
again
in
Holland
;
for
it
have
be
very
violent
there
,
and
particularly
at
Amsterdam
and
Rotterdam
,
in
the
year
1663
,
whither
,
they
say
,
it
be
bring
,
some
say
from
Italy
,
other
from
the
Levant
,
among
some
good
which
be
bring
home
by
their
Turkey
fleet
;
other
say
it
be
bring
from
Candia
;
other
from
Cyprus
.
<EOS>
It
matter
not
from
whence
it
come
;
but
all
agree
it
be
come
into
Holland
again
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
no
such
thing
as
print
newspaper
in
those
day
to
spread
rumour
and
report
of
thing
,
and
to
improve
them
by
the
invention
of
man
,
as
I
have
live
to
see
practise
since
.
<EOS>
but
such
thing
as
these
be
gather
from
the
letter
of
merchant
and
other
who
correspond
abroad
,
and
from
them
be
hand
about
by
word
of
mouth
only
;
so
that
thing
do
not
spread
instantly
over
the
whole
nation
,
as
they
do
now
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
that
the
Government
have
a
true
account
of
it
,
and
several
council
be
hold
about
way
to
prevent
its
come
over
;
but
all
be
keep
very
private
.
<EOS>
hence
it
be
that
this
rumour
die
off
again
,
and
people
begin
to
forget
it
as
a
thing
we
be
very
little
concerned
in
,
and
that
we
hope
be
not
true
;
till
the
latter
end
of
November
or
the
beginning
of
December
1664
when
two
man
,
say
to
be
Frenchmen
,
die
of
the
plague
in
Long
Acre
,
or
rather
at
the
upper
end
of
Drury
Lane
.
<EOS>
the
family
they
be
in
endeavour
to
conceal
it
as
much
as
possible
,
<EOS>
but
as
it
have
get
some
vent
in
the
discourse
of
the
neighbourhood
,
the
Secretaries
of
State
get
knowledge
of
it
;
and
concern
themselves
to
inquire
about
it
,
in
order
to
be
certain
of
the
truth
,
two
physician
and
a
surgeon
be
order
to
go
to
the
house
and
make
inspection
.
<EOS>
this
they
do
;
and
find
evident
token
of
the
sickness
upon
both
the
body
that
be
dead
,
they
give
their
opinion
publicly
that
they
die
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
it
be
give
in
to
the
parish
clerk
,
and
he
also
return
them
to
the
Hall
;
and
it
be
print
in
the
weekly
bill
of
mortality
in
the
usual
manner
,
thus
     
Plague
,
2
.
<EOS>
Parishes
infect
,
1
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
show
a
great
concern
at
this
,
and
begin
to
be
alarm
all
over
the
town
,
and
the
more
,
because
in
the
last
week
in
December
1664
another
man
die
in
the
same
house
,
and
of
the
same
distemper
.
<EOS>
and
then
we
be
easy
again
for
about
six
week
,
when
none
have
die
with
any
mark
of
infection
,
it
be
say
the
distemper
be
go
;
but
after
that
,
I
think
it
be
about
the
12th
of
February
,
another
die
in
another
house
,
but
in
the
same
parish
and
in
the
same
manner
.
  
<EOS>
this
turn
the
people
's
eye
pretty
much
towards
that
end
of
the
town
,
and
the
weekly
bill
show
an
increase
of
burial
in
St
Giles
's
parish
more
than
usual
,
it
begin
to
be
suspect
that
the
plague
be
among
the
people
at
that
end
of
the
town
,
and
that
many
have
die
of
it
,
though
they
have
take
care
to
keep
it
as
much
from
the
knowledge
of
the
public
as
possible
.
<EOS>
this
possess
the
head
of
the
people
very
much
,
and
few
care
to
go
through
Drury
Lane
,
or
the
other
street
suspect
,
unless
they
have
extraordinary
business
that
oblige
them
to
it
  
<EOS>
this
increase
of
the
bill
stand
thus
:
the
usual
number
of
burial
in
a
week
,
in
the
parish
of
St
Giles
-
in
-
the
-
Fields
and
St
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
be
from
twelve
to
seventeen
or
nineteen
each
,
few
more
or
less
;
but
from
the
time
that
the
plague
first
begin
in
St
Giles
's
parish
,
it
be
observe
that
the
ordinary
burial
increase
in
number
considerably
.

besides
this
,
it
be
observe
with
great
uneasiness

the

this

be
really
frightful
,
be
a
high
number
than
have
be
know
to
have
be
bury
in
one
week
since
the
precede
visitation
of
1656
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
all
this
go
off
again
,
and
the
weather
prove
cold
,
and
the
frost
,
which
begin
in
December
,
still
continue
very
severe
even
till
near
the
end
of
February
,
attend
with
sharp
though
moderate
wind
,
the
bill
decrease
again
,
and
the
city
grow
healthy
,
and
everybody
begin
to
look
upon
the
danger
as
good
as
over
;
only
that
still
the
burial
in
St
Giles
's
continued
high
.
<EOS>
from
the
beginning
of
April
especially
they
stand
at
twenty
-
five
each
week
,
till
the
week
from
the
18th
to
the
25th
,
when
there
be
bury
in
St
Giles
's
parish
thirty
,
whereof
two
of
the
plague
and
eight
of
the
spot
-
fever
,
which
be
look
upon
as
the
same
thing
;
likewise
the
number
that
die
of
the
spot
-
fever
in
the
whole
increase
,
be
eight
the
week
before
,
and
twelve
<EOS>
the
week
above
-
name
.
  
<EOS>
this
alarm
us
all
again
,
and
terrible
apprehension
be
among
the
people
,
especially
the
weather
be
now
change
and
grow
warm
,
and
the
summer
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
next
week
there
seem
to
be
some
hope
again
;
the
bill
be
low
,
the
number
of
the
dead
in
all
be
but
388
,
there
be
none
of
the
plague
,
<EOS>
and
but
four
of
the
spot
-
fever
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
follow
week
it
return
again
,
and
the
distemper
be
spread
into
two
or
three
other
parish
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
St
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
;
St
Clement
Danes
;
and
,
to
the
great
affliction
of
the
city
,
one
die
within
the
wall
,
in
the
parish
of
St
Mary
Woolchurch
,
that
be
to
say
,
in
Bearbinder
Lane
,
near
Stocks
Market
;
in
all
there
be
nine
of
the
plague
and
six
of
the
spot
-
fever
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
upon
inquiry
find
that
this
Frenchman
who
die
in
Bearbinder
Lane
be
one
who
,
have
live
in
Long
Acre
,
near
the
infected
house
,
have
remove
for
fear
of
the
distemper
,
not
know
that
he
be
already
infect
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
beginning
of
May
,
yet
the
weather
be
temperate
,
variable
,
and
cool
enough
,
and
people
have
still
some
hope
.
<EOS>
that
which
encourage
them
be
that
the
city
be
healthy
:
the
whole
ninety
-
seven
parish
bury
but
fifty
-
four
,
and
we
begin
to
hope
that
,
as
it
be
chiefly
among
the
people
at
that
end
of
the
town
,
it
may
go
no
farther
;
and
the
rather
,
because
the
next
week
,
which
be
from
the
9th
of
May
to
the
16th
,
there
die
but
three
,
of
which
not
one
within
the
whole
city
or
liberty
;
and
St
Andrew
's
bury
but
fifteen
,
which
be
very
low
.
'
<EOS>
tis
true
St
Giles
's
bury
two
-
and
-
thirty
,
but
still
,
as
there
be
but
one
of
the
plague
,
people
begin
to
be
easy
.
<EOS>
the
whole
bill
also
be
very
low
,
for
the
week
before
the
bill
be
but
347
,
and
the
week
above
mention
but
343
.
<EOS>
We
continue
in
these
hope
for
a
few
day
,
but
it
be
but
for
a
few
,
for
the
people
be
no
more
to
be
deceive
thus
;
they
search
the
house
and
find
that
the
plague
be
really
spread
every
way
,
and
that
many
die
of
it
every
day
.
<EOS>
so
that
now
all
our
extenuation
abate
,
and
it
be
no
more
to
be
conceal
;
nay
,
it
quickly
appear
that
the
infection
have
spread
itself
beyond
all
hope
of
abatement
.
<EOS>
that
in
the
parish
of
St
Giles
it
be
get
into
several
street
,
and
several
family
lie
all
sick
together
;
and
,
accordingly
,
in
the
weekly
bill
for
the
next
week
the
thing
begin
to
show
itself
.
<EOS>
there
be
indeed
but
fourteen
set
down
of
the
plague
,
but
this
be
all
knavery
and
collusion
,
for
in
St
Giles
's
parish
they
bury
forty
in
all
,
whereof
it
be
certain
most
of
them
die
of
the
plague
,
though
they
be
set
down
of
other
distemper
;
and
though
the
number
of
all
the
burial
be
not
increase
above
thirty
-
two
,
and
the
whole
bill
be
but
385
,
yet
there
be
fourteen
of
the
spot
-
fever
,
as
well
as
fourteen
of
the
plague
;
and
we
take
it
for
grant
upon
the
whole
that
there
be
fifty
die
that
week
of
the
plague
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
bill
be
from
the
23rd
of
May
to
the
30th
,
when
the
number
of
the
plague
be
seventeen
.
<EOS>
but
the
burial
in
St
Giles
's
be
fifty
-
three
 
a
frightful
number
!
 
<EOS>
of
whom
they
set
down
<EOS>
but
nine
of
the
plague
;
<EOS>
but
on
an
examination
more
strictly
by
the
justice
of
peace
,
and
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
request
,
it
be
find
there
be
twenty
more
who
be
really
dead
of
the
plague
in
that
parish
,
but
have
be
set
down
of
the
spot
-
fever
or
other
distemper
,
besides
other
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
but
those
be
trifle
thing
to
what
follow
immediately
after
;
for
now
the
weather
set
in
hot
,
and
from
the
first
week
in
June
the
infection
spread
in
a
dreadful
manner
,
and
the
bill
rise
high
;
the
article
of
the
fever
,
spot
-
fever
,
and
tooth
begin
to
swell
;
for
all
that
could
conceal
their
distemper
do
it
,
to
prevent
their
neighbour
shun
and
refuse
to
converse
with
them
,
and
also
to
prevent
authority
shut
up
their
house
;
which
,
though
it
be
not
yet
practise
,
yet
be
threaten
,
and
people
be
extremely
terrified
at
the
thought
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
week
in
June
,
the
parish
of
St
Giles
,
where
still
the
weight
of
the
infection
lie
,
bury
120
,
whereof
though
the
bill
say
but
sixty
-
eight
of
the
plague
,
everybody
say
there
have
be
100
at
least
,
calculate
it
from
the
usual
number
of
funeral
in
that
parish
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
till
this
week
the
city
continue
free
,
there
have
never
any
die
,
except
that
one
Frenchman
whom
I
mention
before
,
within
the
whole
ninety
-
seven
parish
.
<EOS>
now
there
die
four
within
the
city
,
one
in
Wood
Street
,
one
in
Fenchurch
Street
,
and
two
in
Crooked
Lane
.
<EOS>
southwark
be
entirely
free
,
have
not
one
yet
die
on
that
side
of
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
without
Aldgate
,
about
midway
between
Aldgate
Church
and
Whitechappel
Bars
,
on
the
left
hand
or
north
side
of
the
street
;
and
as
the
distemper
have
not
reach
to
that
side
of
the
city
,
our
neighbourhood
continue
very
easy
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
their
consternation
be
very
great
:
and
the
rich
sort
of
people
,
especially
the
nobility
and
gentry
from
the
west
part
of
the
city
,
throng
out
of
town
with
their
family
and
servant
in
an
unusual
manner
;
and
this
be
more
particularly
see
in
Whitechappel
;
that
be
to
say
,
the
Broad
Street
where
I
live
;
indeed
,
nothing
be
to
be
see
but
waggon
and
cart
,
with
good
,
woman
,
servant
,
child
,
&
c.
;
coach
fill
with
people
of
the
well
sort
and
horseman
attend
them
,
and
all
hurry
away
;
then
empty
waggon
and
cart
appear
,
and
spare
horse
with
servant
,
who
,
it
be
apparent
,
be
return
or
send
from
the
country
to
fetch
more
people
;
besides
innumerable
number
of
man
on
horseback
,
some
alone
,
other
with
servant
,
and
,
generally
speak
,
all
load
with
baggage
and
fit
out
for
travel
,
as
anyone
may
perceive
by
their
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
terrible
and
melancholy
thing
to
see
,
and
as
it
be
a
sight
which
I
could
not
but
look
on
from
morning
to
night
<EOS>
(
for
indeed
there
be
nothing
else
of
moment
to
be
see
)
,
it
fill
me
with
very
serious
thought
of
the
misery
that
be
come
upon
the
city
,
and
the
unhappy
condition
of
those
that
would
be
leave
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
hurry
of
the
people
be
such
for
some
week
that
there
be
no
get
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
door
without
exceed
difficulty
;
there
be
such
press
and
crowd
there
to
get
pass
and
certificate
of
health
for
such
as
travel
abroad
,
for
without
these
there
be
no
be
admit
to
pass
through
the
town
upon
the
road
,
or
to
lodge
in
any
inn
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
there
have
none
die
in
the
city
for
all
this
time
,
my
Lord
Mayor
give
certificate
of
health
without
any
difficulty
to
all
those
who
live
in
the
ninety
-
seven
parish
,
and
to
those
within
the
liberty
too
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
this
hurry
,
I
say
,
continue
some
week
,
that
be
to
say
,
all
the
month
of
May
and
June
,
and
the
more
because
it
be
rumour
that
an
order
of
the
Government
be
to
be
issue
out
to
place
turnpike
and
barrier
on
the
road
to
prevent
people
travel
,
and
that
the
town
on
the
road
would
not
suffer
people
from
London
to
pass
for
fear
of
bring
the
infection
along
with
them
,
though
neither
of
these
rumour
have
any
foundation
but
in
the
imagination
,
especially
at
-
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
consider
seriously
with
myself
concern
my
own
case
,
and
how
I
should
dispose
of
myself
;
that
be
to
say
,
whether
I
should
resolve
to
stay
in
London
or
shut
up
my
house
and
flee
,
as
many
of
my
neighbour
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
set
this
particular
down
so
fully
,
because
I
know
not
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
of
moment
to
those
who
come
after
me
,
if
they
come
to
be
bring
to
the
same
distress
,
and
to
the
same
manner
of
make
their
choice
;
and
therefore
I
desire
this
account
may
pass
with
them
rather
for
a
direction
to
themselves
to
act
by
than
a
history
of
my
acting
,
see
it
may
not
<EOS>
he
of
one
farthe
value
to
them
to
note
what
become
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
two
important
thing
before
me
:
the
one
be
the
carrying
on
my
business
and
shop
,
which
be
considerable
,
and
in
which
be
embark
all
my
effect
in
the
world
;
and
the
other
be
the
preservation
of
my
life
in
so
dismal
a
calamity
as
I
see
apparently
be
come
upon
the
whole
city
,
and
which
,
however
great
it
be
,
my
fear
perhaps
,
as
well
as
other
people
's
,
represent
to
be
much
great
than
it
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
consideration
be
of
great
moment
to
me
;
my
trade
be
a
saddler
,
and
as
my
dealing
be
chiefly
not
by
a
shop
or
chance
trade
,
but
among
the
merchant
trade
to
the
english
colony
in
America
,
so
my
effect
lie
very
much
in
the
hand
of
such
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
single
man
,
'
tis
true
,
but
I
have
a
family
of
servant
whom
I
keep
at
my
business
;
have
a
house
,
shop
,
and
warehouse
fill
with
good
;
and
,
in
short
,
to
leave
them
all
as
thing
in
such
a
case
must
be
leave
(
that
be
to
say
,
without
any
overseer
or
person
fit
to
be
trust
with
them
)
,
have
be
to
hazard
the
loss
not
only
of
my
trade
,
but
of
my
good
,
and
indeed
of
all
I
have
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
an
eld
brother
at
the
same
time
in
London
,
and
not
many
year
before
come
over
from
Portugal
:
and
advise
with
him
,
his
answer
be
in
three
word
,
the
same
that
be
give
in
another
case
quite
different
,
viz
.
,
"
Master
,
save
thyself
.
<EOS>
"
in
a
word
,
he
be
for
my
retiring
into
the
country
,
as
he
resolve
to
do
himself
with
his
family
;
tell
me
what
he
have
,
it
seem
,
hear
abroad
,
that
the
good
preparation
for
the
plague
be
to
run
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
as
to
my
argument
of
lose
my
trade
,
my
good
,
or
debt
,
he
quite
confute
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
the
same
thing
which
I
argue
for
my
staying
,
viz
.
,
that
I
would
trust
God
with
my
safety
and
health
,
be
the
strong
repulse
to
my
pretension
of
lose
my
trade
and
my
good
;
"
for
"
,
say
he
,
"
be
it
not
as
reasonable
that
you
should
trust
God
with
the
chance
or
risk
of
lose
your
trade
,
as
that
you
should
stay
in
so
eminent
a
point
of
danger
,
and
trust
Him
with
your
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
argue
that
I
be
in
any
strait
as
to
a
place
where
to
go
,
have
several
friend
and
relation
in
Northamptonshire
,
whence
our
family
first
come
from
;
and
particularly
,
I
have
an
only
sister
in
Lincolnshire
,
very
willing
to
receive
and
entertain
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
brother
,
who
have
already
send
his
wife
and
two
child
into
Bedfordshire
,
and
resolve
to
follow
them
,
press
my
go
very
earnestly
;
and
I
have
once
resolve
to
comply
with
his
desire
,
but
at
that
time
could
get
no
horse
;
for
though
it
be
true
all
the
people
do
not
go
out
of
the
city
of
London
,
yet
I
may
venture
to
say
that
in
a
manner
all
the
horse
do
;
for
there
be
hardly
a
horse
to
be
buy
or
hire
in
the
whole
city
for
some
week
.
<EOS>
once
I
resolve
to
travel
on
foot
with
one
servant
,
and
,
as
many
do
,
lie
at
no
inn
,
but
carry
a
soldier
's
tent
with
us
,
and
so
lie
in
the
field
,
the
weather
be
very
warm
,
and
no
danger
from
take
cold
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
as
many
do
,
because
several
do
so
at
last
,
especially
those
who
have
be
in
the
army
in
the
war
which
have
not
be
many
year
past
;
and
I
must
needs
<EOS>
say
that
,
speak
of
second
cause
,
have
most
of
the
people
that
travel
do
so
,
the
plague
have
not
be
carry
into
so
many
country
town
and
house
as
it
be
,
to
the
great
damage
,
and
indeed
to
the
ruin
,
of
abundance
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
my
servant
,
whom
I
have
intend
to
take
down
with
me
,
deceive
me
;
and
be
fright
at
the
increase
of
the
distemper
,
and
not
know
when
I
should
go
,
he
take
other
measure
,
and
leave
me
,
so
I
be
put
off
for
that
time
;
and
,
one
way
or
other
,
I
always
find
that
to
appoint
to
go
away
be
always
cross
by
some
accident
or
other
,
so
as
to
disappoint
and
put
it
off
again
;
and
this
bring
in
a
story
which
otherwise
may
be
think
a
needless
digression
,
viz
.
,
about
these
disappointment
be
from
Heaven
.
  
<EOS>
I
mention
this
story
also
as
the
good
method
I
can
advise
any
person
to
take
in
such
a
case
,
especially
if
he
be
one
that
make
conscience
of
his
duty
,
and
would
be
direct
what
to
do
in
it
,
namely
,
that
he
should
keep
his
eye
upon
the
particular
providence
which
occur
at
that
time
,
and
look
upon
them
complexly
,
as
they
regard
one
another
,
and
as
all
together
regard
the
question
before
him
:
and
<EOS>
then
,
I
think
,
he
may
safely
take
them
for
intimation
from
Heaven
of
what
be
his
unquestioned
duty
to
do
in
such
a
case
;
I
mean
as
to
go
away
from
or
stay
in
the
place
where
we
dwell
,
when
visit
with
an
infectious
distemper
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
very
warmly
into
my
mind
one
morning
,
as
I
be
muse
on
this
particular
thing
,
that
as
nothing
attend
us
without
the
direction
or
permission
of
Divine
Power
,
so
these
disappointment
must
have
something
in
them
extraordinary
;
and
I
ought
to
consider
whether
it
do
not
evidently
point
out
,
or
intimate
to
me
,
that
it
be
the
will
of
Heaven
I
should
not
go
.
<EOS>
It
immediately
follow
in
my
thought
,
that
if
it
really
be
from
God
that
I
should
stay
,
He
be
able
effectually
to
preserve
me
in
the
midst
of
all
the
death
and
danger
that
would
surround
me
;
and
that
if
I
attempt
to
secure
myself
by
flee
from
my
habitation
,
and
act
contrary
to
these
intimation
,
which
I
believe
to
be
Divine
,
it
be
a
kind
of
flying
from
God
,
and
that
He
could
cause
His
justice
to
overtake
me
when
and
where
He
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
these
thought
quite
turn
my
resolution
again
,
and
when
I
come
to
discourse
with
my
brother
again
I
tell
him
that
I
incline
to
stay
and
take
my
lot
in
that
station
in
which
God
have
place
me
,
and
that
it
seem
to
be
make
more
especially
my
duty
,
on
the
account
of
what
I
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
My
brother
,
though
a
very
religious
man
himself
,
laugh
at
all
I
have
suggest
about
its
be
an
intimation
from
Heaven
,
and
tell
me
several
story
of
such
foolhardy
people
,
as
he
call
them
,
as
I
be
;
that
I
ought
indeed
to
submit
to
it
as
a
work
of
Heaven
if
I
have
be
any
way
disable
by
distemper
or
disease
,
and
that
then
not
be
able
to
go
,
I
ought
to
acquiesce
in
the
direction
of
Him
,
who
,
have
be
my
Maker
,
have
an
undisputed
right
of
sovereignty
in
dispose
of
me
,
and
that
then
there
have
be
no
difficulty
to
determine
which
be
the
call
of
His
providence
and
which
be
not
;
but
that
I
should
take
it
as
an
intimation
from
Heaven
that
I
should
not
go
out
of
town
,
only
because
I
could
not
hire
a
horse
to
go
,
or
my
fellow
be
run
away
<EOS>
that
be
to
attend
me
<EOS>
,
be
ridiculous
,
since
at
the
time
I
have
my
health
and
limb
,
and
other
servant
,
and
may
with
ease
travel
a
day
or
two
on
foot
,
and
have
a
good
certificate
of
be
in
perfect
health
,
may
either
hire
a
horse
or
take
post
on
the
road
,
as
I
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
proceed
to
tell
me
of
the
mischievous
consequence
which
attend
the
presumption
of
the
Turks
and
Mahometans
in
Asia
and
in
other
place
where
he
have
be
(
for
my
brother
,
be
a
merchant
,
be
a
few
year
before
,
as
I
have
already
observe
,
return
from
abroad
,
come
last
from
Lisbon
)
,
and
how
,
presume
upon
their
profess
predestinating
notion
,
and
of
every
man
's
end
be
predetermine
and
unalterably
beforehand
decreed
,
they
would
go
unconcerned
into
infected
place
and
converse
with
infected
person
,
by
which
mean
they
die
at
the
rate
of
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
a
week
,
whereas
the
Europeans
or
christian
merchant
,
who
keep
themselves
retire
and
reserve
,
generally
escape
the
contagion
.
  
<EOS>
upon
these
argument
my
brother
change
my
resolution
again
,
and
I
begin
to
resolve
to
go
,
and
accordingly
make
all
thing
ready
;
for
,
in
short
,
the
infection
increase
round
me
,
and
the
bill
be
rise
to
almost
seven
hundred
a
week
,
and
my
brother
tell
me
he
would
venture
to
stay
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
desire
him
to
let
me
consider
of
it
but
till
the
next
day
,
and
I
would
resolve
:
and
as
I
have
already
prepare
everything
as
well
as
I
could
as
to
my
business
,
and
whom
to
entrust
my
affair
with
,
I
have
little
to
do
but
to
resolve
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
home
that
evening
greatly
oppress
in
my
mind
,
irresolute
,
and
not
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
set
the
evening
wholly
 
apart
to
consider
seriously
about
it
,
and
be
all
alone
;
for
already
people
have
,
as
it
be
by
a
general
consent
,
take
up
the
custom
of
not
go
out
of
door
after
sunset
;
the
reason
I
shall
have
occasion
to
say
more
of
by
-
and
-
by
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
retirement
of
this
evening
I
endeavour
to
resolve
,
first
,
what
be
my
duty
to
do
,
and
I
state
the
argument
with
which
my
brother
have
press
me
to
go
into
the
country
,
and
I
set
,
against
them
the
strong
impression
which
I
have
on
my
mind
for
stay
;
the
visible
call
I
seem
to
have
from
the
particular
circumstance
of
my
calling
,
and
the
care
due
from
me
for
the
preservation
of
my
effect
,
which
be
,
as
I
may
say
,
my
estate
;
also
the
intimation
which
I
think
I
have
from
Heaven
,
that
to
me
signify
a
kind
of
direction
to
venture
;
and
it
occur
to
me
that
if
I
have
what
I
may
call
a
direction
to
stay
,
I
ought
to
suppose
it
contain
a
promise
of
be
preserve
if
I
obey
.
  
<EOS>
this
lie
close
to
me
,
and
my
mind
seem
more
and
more
encouraged
to
stay
than
ever
,
and
support
with
a
secret
satisfaction
that
I
should
be
keep
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
,
that
,
turn
over
the
Bible
which
lie
before
me
,
and
while
my
thought
be
more
than
ordinarily
serious
upon
the
question
,
I
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
know
not
what
to
do
;
Lord
,
direct
me
I
"
and
the
like
;
and
at
that
juncture
I
happen
to
stop
turn
over
the
book
at
the
gist
Psalm
,
and
cast
my
eye
on
the
second
verse
<EOS>
,
I
read
on
to
the
seventh
verse
exclusive
,
and
after
that
include
the
tenth
,
as
follow
:
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
of
the
Lord
,
He
be
my
refuge
and
my
fortress
:
my
God
,
in
Him
will
I
trust
.
<EOS>
surely
He
shall
deliver
thee
from
the
snare
of
the
fowler
,
and
from
the
noisome
pestilence
.
<EOS>
He
shall
cover
thee
with
His
feather
,
and
under
His
wing
shalt
thou
trust
:
<EOS>
His
truth
shall
be
thy
shield
and
buckler
.
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
;
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
;
nor
for
the
pestilence
that
walketh
in
darkness
;
nor
for
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
noonday
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
shall
fall
at
thy
side
,
and
ten
thousand
at
thy
right
hand
;
but
it
shall
not
come
nigh
thee
.
<EOS>
only
with
thine
eye
shalt
thou
behold
and
see
the
reward
of
the
wicked
.
<EOS>
because
thou
hast
make
the
Lord
,
which
be
my
refuge
,
even
the
most
high
,
thy
habitation
;
there
shall
no
evil
befall
thee
,
neither
<EOS>
shall
any
plague
come
nigh
thy
dwelling
,
"
&
C.
  
<EOS>
I
scarce
nee
tell
the
reader
that
from
that
moment
I
resolve
that
I
would
stay
in
the
town
,
and
cast
myself
entirely
upon
the
goodness
and
protection
of
the
Almighty
,
would
not
seek
any
other
shelter
whatever
;
and
that
,
as
my
time
be
in
His
hand
,
He
be
as
able
to
keep
me
in
a
time
of
the
infection
as
in
a
time
of
health
;
and
if
He
do
not
think
fit
to
deliver
me
,
still
I
be
in
His
hand
,
and
it
be
meet
<EOS>
He
should
do
with
me
as
should
seem
good
to
Him
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
resolution
I
go
to
bed
;
and
I
be
further
confirm
in
it
the
next
day
by
the
woman
be
take
ill
with
whom
I
have
intend
to
entrust
my
house
and
all
my
affair
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
further
obligation
lay
on
me
on
the
same
side
,
for
the
next
day
I
find
myself
very
much
out
of
order
also
,
so
that
if
I
would
have
go
away
,
I
could
not
,
and
I
continue
ill
three
or
four
day
,
and
this
entirely
determine
my
stay
;
so
I
take
my
leave
of
my
brother
,
who
go
away
to
Dorking
,
in
Surrey
,
and
afterwards
fetch
a
round
farther
into
Buckinghamshire
or
Bedfordshire
,
to
a
retreat
he
have
find
out
there
for
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
ill
time
to
be
sick
in
,
for
if
any
one
complain
,
it
be
immediately
say
he
have
the
plague
;
and
though
I
have
indeed
no
symptom
of
that
distemper
,
yet
be
very
ill
,
both
in
my
head
and
in
my
stomach
,
I
be
not
without
apprehension
that
I
really
be
infect
;
but
in
about
three
day
I
grow
better
;
the
third
night
I
rest
well
,
sweat
a
little
,
and
be
much
refresh
.
<EOS>
the
apprehension
of
its
be
the
infection
go
also
quite
away
with
my
illness
,
and
I
go
about
my
business
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
,
however
,
put
off
all
my
thought
of
go
into
the
country
;
and
my
brother
also
be
go
,
I
have
no
more
debate
either
with
him
or
with
myself
on
that
subject
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
mid
-
July
,
and
the
plague
,
which
have
chiefly
rage
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
and
,
as
I
say
before
,
in
the
parish
of
St
Giles
,
St
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
and
towards
Westminster
,
begin
to
now
come
eastward
towards
the
part
where
I
live
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
observe
,
indeed
,
that
it
do
not
come
straight
on
towards
us
;
for
the
city
,
that
be
to
say
,
within
the
wall
,
be
indifferently
healthy
still
;
nor
be
it
get
then
very
much
over
the
water
into
Southwark
;
for
though
there
die
that
week
1268
of
all
distemper
,
whereof
it
may
be
suppose
above
600
die
of
the
plague
,
yet
there
be
but
twenty
-
eight
in
the
whole
city
,
within
the
wall
,
<EOS>
and
but
nineteen
in
Southwark
,
Lambeth
parish
include
;
whereas
in
the
parish
of
St
Giles
and
St
Martin
-
in
-
the
-
Fields
alone
there
die
421
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
perceive
the
infection
keep
chiefly
in
the
out
-
parish
,
which
be
very
populous
,
and
full
also
of
poor
,
the
distemper
find
more
to
prey
upon
than
in
the
city
,
as
I
shall
observe
afterwards
.
<EOS>
We
perceive
,
I
say
,
the
distemper
to
draw
our
way
,
viz
.
,
by
the
parish
of
Clarkenwell
,
Cripplegate
,
Shoreditch
,
and
Bishopsgate
;
which
last
two
parish
join
to
Aldgate
,
Whitechappel
,
and
Stepney
,
the
infection
come
at
length
to
spread
its
utmost
rage
and
violence
in
those
part
,
even
when
it
abate
at
the
western
parish
where
it
begin
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
strange
to
observe
that
in
this
particular
week
,
from
the
4th
to
the
11th
of
July
,
when
,
as
I
have
observe
,
there
die
near
400
of
the
plague
in
the
two
parish
of
St
Martin
and
St
Giles
-
in
-
the
-
field
only
<EOS>
,
there
die
in
the
parish
of
Aldgate
but
four
,
in
the
parish
of
Whitechappel
three
,
in
the
parish
of
Stepney
but
one
.
  
<EOS>
likewise
in
the
next
week
,
from
the
11th
of
July
to
the
18th
,
when
the
week
's
bill
be
1761
,
yet
there
die
no
more
of
the
plague
,
on
the
whole
southwark
side
of
the
water
,
than
sixteen
.
<EOS>
but
this
face
of
thing
soon
change
,
and
it
begin
to
thicken
in
Cripplegate
parish
especially
,
and
in
Clarkenwell
;
so
that
by
the
second
week
in
August
,
Cripplegate
parish
alone
bury
886
,
and
Clarkenwell
155
.
<EOS>
of
the
first
,
850
may
well
be
reckon
to
die
of
the
plague
;
and
of
the
last
,
the
bill
itself
say
145
be
of
the
plague
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
month
of
July
,
and
while
,
as
I
have
observe
,
our
part
of
the
town
seem
to
be
spare
in
comparison
of
the
west
part
,
I
go
ordinarily
about
the
street
,
as
my
business
require
,
and
particularly
go
generally
once
in
a
day
,
or
in
two
day
,
into
the
city
,
to
my
brother
's
house
,
which
he
have
give
me
charge
of
,
and
to
see
if
it
be
safe
;
and
have
the
key
in
my
pocket
,
I
use
to
go
into
the
house
,
and
over
most
of
the
room
,
to
see
that
all
be
well
;
for
though
it
be
something
wonderful
to
tell
,
that
any
should
have
heart
so
harden
in
the
midst
of
such
a
calamity
as
to
rob
and
steal
,
yet
certain
<EOS>
it
be
that
all
sort
of
villainy
,
and
even
levity
and
debauchery
,
be
then
practise
in
the
town
as
openly
as
ever
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
quite
as
frequently
,
because
the
number
of
people
be
many
way
lessen
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
city
itself
begin
now
to
be
visit
too
,
I
mean
within
the
wall
;
but
the
number
of
people
there
be
indeed
extremely
lessen
by
so
great
a
multitude
have
be
go
into
the
country
;
and
even
all
this
month
of
July
they
continue
to
flee
,
though
not
in
such
multitude
as
formerly
.
<EOS>
in
August
,
indeed
,
they
flee
in
such
a
manner
that
I
begin
to
think
there
would
be
really
none
but
magistrate
and
servant
leave
in
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
flee
now
out
of
the
city
,
so
I
should
observe
that
the
Court
remove
early
,
viz
.
,
in
the
month
of
June
,
and
go
to
Oxford
,
where
it
please
God
to
preserve
them
;
and
the
distemper
do
not
,
as
I
hear
of
,
so
much
as
touch
them
,
for
which
I
can
not
say
that
I
ever
see
they
show
any
great
token
of
thankfulness
,
and
hardly
anything
of
reformation
,
though
they
do
not
want
be
tell
that
their
crying
vice
may
without
breach
of
charity
be
say
to
have
go
far
in
bring
that
terrible
judgement
upon
the
whole
nation
.
  
<EOS>
the
face
of
London
be
 
now
indeed
strangely
alter
:
I
mean
the
whole
mass
of
building
,
city
,
liberty
,
suburb
,
Westminster
,
Southwark
,
and
altogether
;
for
as
to
the
particular
part
call
the
city
,
or
within
the
wall
,
that
be
not
yet
much
infect
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
whole
the
face
of
thing
,
I
say
,
be
much
alter
;
sorrow
and
sadness
sit
upon
every
face
;
and
though
some
part
be
not
yet
overwhelmed
,
yet
all
look
deeply
concerned
;
and
,
as
we
see
it
apparently
come
on
,
so
every
one
look
on
himself
and
his
family
as
in
the
utmost
danger
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
to
represent
those
time
exactly
to
those
that
do
not
see
them
,
and
give
the
reader
due
idea
of
the
horror
"
that
everywhere
present
itself
,
it
must
make
just
impression
upon
their
mind
and
fill
them
with
surprise
.
<EOS>
London
may
well
be
say
to
be
all
in
tear
;
the
mourner
do
not
go
about
the
street
indeed
,
for
nobody
put
on
black
or
make
a
formal
dress
of
mourning
for
their
near
friend
;
but
the
voice
of
mourner
be
truly
hear
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
shriek
of
woman
and
child
at
the
window
and
door
of
their
house
,
where
their
dear
relation
be
perhaps
die
,
or
just
dead
,
be
so
frequent
to
be
hear
as
we
pass
the
street
,
that
it
be
enough
to
pierce
the
stout
heart
in
the
world
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
tear
and
lamentation
be
see
almost
in
every
house
,
especially
in
the
first
part
of
the
visitation
;
for
towards
the
latter
end
man
's
heart
be
harden
,
and
death
be
so
always
before
their
eye
,
that
they
do
not
so
much
concern
themselves
for
the
loss
of
their
friend
,
expect
that
themselves
should
be
summon
the
next
hour
.
  
<EOS>
business
lead
me
out
sometimes
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
even
when
the
sickness
be
chiefly
there
;
and
as
the
thing
be
new
to
me
,
as
well
as
to
everybody
else
,
it
be
a
most
surprising
thing
to
see
those
street
which
be
usually
so
thronged
now
grow
desolate
,
and
so
few
people
to
be
see
in
them
,
that
if
I
have
be
a
stranger
and
at
a
loss
for
my
way
,
I
may
sometimes
have
go
the
length
of
a
whole
street
(
I
mean
of
the
by
-
street
)
,
and
see
nobody
to
direct
me
except
watchmen
set
at
the
door
of
such
house
as
be
shut
up
,
of
which
I
shall
speak
presently
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
be
at
that
part
of
the
town
on
some
special
business
,
curiosity
lead
me
to
observe
thing
more
than
usually
,
and
indeed
I
walk
a
great
way
where
I
have
no
business
.
<EOS>
I
go
up
Holborn
,
and
there
the
street
be
full
of
people
,
but
they
walk
in
the
middle
of
the
great
street
,
neither
on
one
side
or
other
,
because
,
as
I
suppose
,
they
would
not
mingle
with
anybody
that
come
out
of
house
,
or
meet
with
smell
and
scent
from
house
that
may
be
infect
.
  
<EOS>
the
Inns
of
Court
be
all
shut
up
;
nor
be
very
many
of
the
lawyer
in
the
Temple
,
or
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
or
Gray
's
Inn
,
to
be
see
there
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
at
peace
;
there
be
no
occasion
for
lawyer
;
besides
,
it
be
in
the
time
of
the
vacation
too
,
they
be
generally
go
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
whole
row
of
house
in
some
place
be
shut
close
up
,
the
inhabitant
all
flee
,
and
only
a
watchman
or
two
left
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
speak
of
row
of
house
be
shut
up
,
I
do
not
mean
shut
up
by
the
magistrate
,
but
that
great
number
of
person
follow
the
Court
,
by
the
necessity
of
their
employment
and
other
dependence
;
and
as
other
retire
,
really
fright
with
the
distemper
,
it
be
a
mere
desolating
of
some
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
but
the
fright
be
not
yet
near
so
great
in
the
city
,
abstractly
so
call
,
and
particularly
because
,
though
they
be
at
first
in
a
most
inexpressible
consternation
,
yet
as
I
have
observe
that
the
distemper
intermit
often
at
first
,
so
they
be
,
as
it
be
,
alarmed
and
unalarme
again
,
and
<EOS>
this
several
time
,
till
it
begin
to
be
familiar
to
them
;
and
that
even
when
it
appear
violent
,
yet
see
it
do
not
presently
spread
into
the
city
,
or
the
east
and
south
part
,
the
people
begin
to
take
courage
,
and
to
be
,
as
I
may
say
,
a
little
hardened
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
a
vast
many
people
flee
,
as
I
have
observe
,
yet
they
be
chiefly
from
the
west
end
of
the
town
,
and
from
that
we
call
the
heart
of
the
city
:
that
be
to
say
,
among
the
wealthy
of
the
people
,
and
such
people
as
be
unencumbered
with
trade
and
business
.
<EOS>
but
of
the
rest
,
the
generality
stay
,
and
seem
to
abide
the
bad
;
so
that
in
the
place
we
calf
the
Liberties
,
and
in
the
suburb
,
in
southwark
,
and
in
the
east
part
,
such
as
Wapping
,
Ratcliff
,
Stepney
,
Rotherhithe
,
and
the
like
,
the
people
generally
stay
,
except
here
and
there
a
few
wealthy
family
,
who
,
as
above
,
do
not
depend
upon
their
business
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
forget
here
that
the
city
and
suburb
be
prodigiously
full
of
people
at
the
time
of
this
visitation
,
I
mean
at
the
time
that
it
begin
;
for
though
I
have
live
to
see
a
further
increase
,
and
mighty
throng
of
people
settle
in
London
more
than
ever
,
yet
we
have
always
a
notion
that
the
number
of
people
which
,
the
war
be
over
,
the
army
disband
,
and
the
royal
family
and
the
monarchy
be
restore
,
have
flock
to
London
to
settle
in
business
,
or
to
depend
upon
and
attend
the
Court
for
reward
of
service
,
preferment
,
and
the
like
,
be
such
that
the
town
be
compute
to
have
in
it
above
a
hundred
thousand
people
more
than
ever
<EOS>
it
hold
before
;
nay
,
some
take
upon
them
to
say
it
have
twice
as
many
,
because
all
the
ruin
family
of
the
royal
party
flock
hither
.
<EOS>
all
the
old
soldier
set
up
trade
here
,
and
abundance
of
family
settle
here
.
<EOS>
again
,
the
Court
bring
with
them
a
great
flux
of
pride
,
and
new
fashion
.
<EOS>
all
people
be
grow
gay
and
luxurious
,
and
the
joy
of
the
Restoration
have
bring
a
vast
many
family
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
often
think
that
as
Jerusalem
be
besiege
by
the
Romans
when
the
Jews
be
assemble
together
to
celebrate
the
Passover
 
by
which
mean
an
incredible
number
of
people
be
surprised
there
who
would
otherwise
have
be
in
other
country
 
<EOS>
so
the
plague
enter
London
when
an
incredible
increase
of
people
have
happen
occasionally
,
by
the
particular
circumstance
above
-
name
.
<EOS>
as
this
conflux
of
the
people
to
a
youthful
and
gay
Court
make
a
great
trade
in
the
city
,
especially
in
everything
that
belong
to
fashion
and
finery
,
so
it
draw
by
consequence
a
great
number
of
workman
,
manufacturer
,
and
the
like
,
be
mostly
poor
people
who
depend
upon
their
labour
.
<EOS>
and
I
remember
in
particular
that
in
a
representation
to
my
Lord
Mayor
of
the
condition
of
the
poor
,
it
be
estimate
that
there
be
no
less
than
an
hundred
thousand
riband
-
weaver
in
and
about
the
city
,
the
chief
number
of
whom
live
then
in
the
parish
of
Shoreditch
,
Stepney
,
Whitechappel
,
and
Bishopsgate
,
that
,
namely
,
about
spitalfield
;
that
be
to
say
,
as
Spitalfields
be
then
,
for
it
be
not
so
large
as
now
by
one
fifth
part
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
,
however
,
the
number
of
people
in
the
whole
may
be
judge
of
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
often
wonder
that
,
after
the
prodigious
number
of
people
that
go
away
at
first
,
there
be
yet
so
great
a
multitude
leave
as
it
appear
there
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
back
again
to
the
beginning
of
this
surprising
time
.
<EOS>
while
the
fear
of
the
people
be
young
,
they
be
increase
strangely
by
several
odd
accident
which
,
put
altogether
,
it
be
really
a
wonder
the
whole
body
of
the
people
do
not
rise
as
one
man
and
abandon
their
dwelling
,
leave
the
place
as
a
space
of
ground
design
by
Heaven
for
an
Akeldama
,
doom
to
be
destroy
from
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
that
all
that
would
be
find
in
it
would
perish
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
name
but
a
few
of
these
thing
;
but
<EOS>
sure
they
be
so
many
,
and
so
many
wizard
and
cunne
people
propagate
them
,
that
I
have
often
wonder
there
be
any
(
woman
especially
)
leave
behind
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
a
blaze
star
or
comet
appear
for
several
month
before
the
plague
,
as
there
do
the
year
after
another
,
a
little
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
the
old
woman
and
the
phlegmatic
hypochondriac
part
of
the
other
sex
,
whom
I
could
almost
call
old
woman
too
,
remark
(
especially
afterward
,
though
not
till
both
those
judgement
be
over
)
that
those
two
comet
pass
directly
over
the
city
,
and
that
so
very
near
the
house
that
it
be
plain
they
import
something
peculiar
to
the
city
alone
;
that
the
comet
before
the
pestilence
be
of
a
faint
,
dull
,
languid
colour
,
and
its
motion
very
heavy
,
solemn
,
and
slow
;
but
that
the
comet
before
the
fire
be
bright
and
sparkling
,
or
,
as
other
say
,
flame
,
and
its
motion
swift
and
furious
;
and
that
,
accordingly
,
one
foretold
a
heavy
judgement
,
slow
but
severe
,
terrible
and
frightful
,
as
be
the
plague
;
but
the
other
foretold
a
stroke
,
sudden
,
swift
,
and
fiery
as
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
nay
,
so
particular
some
people
be
,
that
as
they
look
upon
that
comet
precede
the
fire
,
they
fancy
that
they
not
only
see
it
pass
swiftly
and
fiercely
,
and
could
perceive
the
motion
with
their
eye
,
but
even
they
hear
it
;
that
it
make
a
rushing
,
mighty
noise
,
fierce
and
terrible
,
though
at
a
distance
,
and
but
just
perceivable
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
both
these
star
,
and
,
I
must
confess
,
have
so
much
of
the
common
notion
of
such
thing
in
my
head
,
that
I
be
apt
to
look
upon
them
as
the
forerunner
and
warning
of
God
's
judgement
;
and
especially
when
,
after
the
plague
have
follow
the
first
,
I
yet
see
another
of
the
like
kind
,
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
say
God
have
not
yet
sufficiently
scourge
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
at
the
same
time
carry
these
thing
to
the
height
that
other
do
,
know
,
too
,
that
natural
cause
be
assign
by
the
astronomer
for
such
thing
,
and
that
their
motion
and
even
their
revolution
be
calculate
,
or
pretend
to
be
calculate
,
so
that
they
can
not
be
so
perfectly
call
the
forerunner
or
foreteller
,
much
less
the
procurer
,
of
such
event
as
pestilence
,
war
,
fire
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
my
thought
and
the
thought
of
the
philosopher
be
,
or
have
be
,
what
they
will
,
these
thing
have
a
more
than
ordinary
influence
upon
the
mind
of
the
common
people
,
and
they
have
almost
universal
melancholy
apprehension
of
some
dreadful
calamity
and
judgement
come
upon
the
city
;
and
this
principally
from
the
sight
of
this
comet
,
and
the
little
alarm
that
be
give
in
December
by
two
people
die
at
St
Giles
's
,
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
the
apprehension
of
the
people
be
likewise
strangely
increase
by
the
error
of
the
time
;
in
which
,
I
think
,
the
people
,
from
what
principle
I
can
not
imagine
,
be
more
addicted
to
prophecy
and
astrological
conjuration
,
dream
,
and
old
wife
'
tale
than
ever
they
be
before
or
since
.
<EOS>
whether
this
unhappy
temper
be
originally
raise
by
the
folly
of
some
people
who
get
money
by
it
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
by
print
prediction
and
prognostication
 
I
know
not
<EOS>
;
but
certain
it
be
,
book
fright
them
terribly
,
such
as
Lilly
's
Almanack
,
Gadbury
's
Astrological
Predictions
,
Poor
Robin
's
Almanack
,
and
the
like
;
also
several
pretend
religious
book
,
one
entitle
,
come
out
of
her
,
my
People
,
lest
you
be
Partaker
of
her
Plagues
;
<EOS>
another
call
,
Fair
Warning
;
another
,
Britain
's
remembrancer
;
and
many
such
,
all
,
or
most
part
of
which
,
foretold
,
directly
or
covertly
,
the
ruin
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
nay
,
some
be
so
enthusiastically
bold
as
to
run
about
the
street
with
their
oral
prediction
,
pretend
they
be
send
to
preach
to
the
city
;
and
one
in
particular
,
who
,
like
Jonah
to
Nineveh
,
cry
in
the
street
,
"
yet
forty
day
,
and
London
shall
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
positive
whether
he
say
yet
forty
day
or
yet
a
few
day
.
<EOS>
another
run
about
naked
,
except
a
pair
of
drawer
about
his
waist
,
cry
day
and
night
,
like
a
man
that
Josephus
mention
,
who
cry
,
"
Woe
to
Jerusalem
!
"
<EOS>
a
little
before
the
destruction
of
that
city
.
<EOS>
so
this
poor
naked
creature
cry
,
"
oh
,
the
great
and
the
dreadful
God
!
"
and
say
no
more
,
but
repeat
those
word
continually
,
with
a
voice
and
countenance
full
of
horror
,
a
swift
pace
;
and
nobody
could
ever
find
him
to
stop
or
rest
,
or
take
any
sustenance
,
at
least
that
ever
I
could
hear
of
.
<EOS>
I
meet
this
poor
creature
several
time
in
the
street
,
and
would
have
speak
to
him
,
but
he
would
not
enter
into
speech
with
me
or
any
one
else
,
but
hold
on
his
dismal
cry
continually
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
terrify
the
people
to
the
last
degree
,
and
especially
when
two
or
three
time
,
as
I
have
mention
already
,
they
find
one
or
two
in
the
bill
dead
of
the
plague
at
St
Giles
's
.
  
<EOS>
next
to
these
public
thing
be
the
dream
of
old
woman
,
or
,
I
should
say
,
the
interpretation
of
old
woman
upon
other
people
's
dream
;
and
these
put
abundance
of
people
even
out
of
their
wit
.
<EOS>
some
hear
voice
warn
them
to
be
go
,
for
that
there
would
be
such
a
plague
in
London
,
so
that
the
live
would
not
be
able
to
bury
the
dead
.
<EOS>
other
see
apparition
in
the
air
;
and
I
must
be
allow
to
say
of
both
<EOS>
,
I
hope
without
breach
of
charity
,
that
they
hear
voice
that
never
spake
,
and
see
sight
that
never
appear
;
but
the
imagination
of
the
people
be
really
turn
wayward
and
possess
.
<EOS>
and
no
wonder
,
if
they
who
be
pore
continually
at
the
cloud
see
shape
and
figure
,
representation
and
appearance
,
which
have
nothing
in
them
but
air
,
and
vapour
.
<EOS>
here
they
tell
us
they
see
a
flaming
sword
hold
in
a
hand
come
out
of
a
cloud
,
with
a
point
hang
directly
over
the
city
;
there
they
see
hearse
and
coffin
in
the
air
carry
to
be
bury
;
and
there
again
,
heap
of
dead
body
lie
unburied
,
and
the
like
,
just
as
the
imagination
of
the
poor
terrified
people
furnish
them
with
matter
to
work
upon
.
<EOS>
so
hypochondriac
fancy
represent
Ships
,
army
,
battle
in
the
firmament
;
till
steady
eye
the
exhalation
solve
,
and
all
to
its
first
matter
,
cloud
,
resolve
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
fill
this
account
with
the
strange
relation
such
people
give
every
day
of
what
they
have
see
;
and
every
one
be
so
positive
of
their
have
see
what
they
pretend
to
see
,
that
there
be
no
contradict
them
without
breach
of
friendship
,
or
be
account
rude
and
unmannerly
on
the
one
hand
,
and
profane
and
impenetrable
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
one
time
before
the
plague
be
begin
(
otherwise
than
as
I
have
say
in
St
Giles
's
)
,
I
think
it
be
in
March
,
see
a
crowd
of
people
in
the
street
,
I
join
with
them
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
,
and
find
them
all
stare
up
into
the
air
to
see
what
a
woman
tell
them
appear
plain
to
her
,
which
be
an
angel
clothe
in
white
,
with
a
fiery
sword
in
his
hand
,
wave
it
or
brandish
it
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
She
describe
every
part
of
the
figure
to
the
life
,
show
them
the
motion
and
the
form
,
and
the
poor
people
come
into
it
so
eagerly
,
and
with
so
much
readiness
;
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
see
it
all
plainly
,
"
say
one
;
"
there
be
the
sword
as
plain
as
can
be
.
"
<EOS>
another
see
the
angel
.
<EOS>
one
see
his
very
face
,
and
cry
out
what
a
glorious
creature
he
be
!
<EOS>
one
see
one
thing
,
and
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
look
as
earnestly
as
the
rest
,
but
perhaps
not
with
so
much
willingness
to
be
impose
upon
;
and
I
say
,
indeed
,
that
I
could
see
nothing
but
a
white
cloud
,
bright
on
one
side
by
the
shining
of
the
sun
upon
the
other
part
.
<EOS>
the
woman
endeavour
to
show
it
me
,
but
could
not
make
me
confess
that
I
see
it
,
which
,
indeed
,
if
I
have
I
must
have
lie
.
<EOS>
but
the
woman
,
turn
upon
me
,
look
in
my
face
,
and
fancy
I
laugh
,
in
which
her
imagination
deceive
her
too
,
for
I
really
do
not
laugh
,
but
be
very
seriously
reflect
how
the
poor
people
be
terrify
by
the
force
of
their
own
imagination
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
turn
from
me
,
call
me
profane
fellow
,
and
a
scoffer
;
tell
me
that
it
be
a
time
of
God
's
anger
,
and
dreadful
judgement
be
approach
,
and
that
despiser
such
as
I
should
wander
and
perish
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
about
her
seem
disgusted
as
well
as
she
;
and
I
find
there
be
no
persuade
them
that
I
do
not
laugh
at
them
,
and
that
I
should
be
rather
mob
by
them
than
be
able
to
undeceive
them
.
<EOS>
so
I
leave
them
;
and
this
appearance
pass
for
as
real
as
the
blaze
star
itself
.
  
<EOS>
another
encounter
I
have
in
the
open
day
also
;
and
this
be
in
go
through
a
narrow
passage
from
Petty
France
into
Bishopsgate
Churchyard
,
by
a
row
of
alm
-
house
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
churchyard
to
Bishopsgate
church
or
parish
;
one
we
go
over
to
pass
from
the
place
call
Petty
France
into
Bishopsgate
Street
,
come
out
just
by
the
church
door
;
the
other
be
on
the
side
of
the
narrow
passage
where
the
alm
-
house
be
on
the
left
;
and
a
dwarf
-
wall
with
a
palisado
on
it
on
the
right
hand
,
and
the
city
wall
on
the
other
side
more
to
the
right
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
narrow
passage
stand
a
man
look
through
between
the
palisadoe
into
the
burying
-
place
,
and
as
many
people
as
the
narrowness
of
the
passage
would
admit
to
stop
,
without
hinder
the
passage
of
other
,
and
he
be
talk
mightily
eagerly
to
them
,
and
point
now
to
one
place
,
then
to
another
,
and
affirm
that
he
see
a
ghost
walk
upon
such
a
gravestone
there
.
<EOS>
He
describe
the
shape
,
the
posture
,
and
the
movement
of
it
<EOS>
so
exactly
that
it
be
the
great
matter
of
amazement
to
him
in
the
world
that
everybody
do
not
see
it
as
well
as
he
.
<EOS>
on
a
sudden
he
would
cry
,
"
there
it
be
;
now
it
come
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
'
Tis
turn
back
"
;
till
at
length
he
persuade
the
people
into
so
firm
a
belief
of
it
,
that
one
fancy
he
see
it
,
and
another
fancy
he
see
it
;
and
thus
he
come
every
day
make
a
strange
hubbub
,
consider
it
be
in
so
narrow
a
passage
,
till
Bishopsgate
clock
strike
eleven
,
and
then
the
ghost
would
seem
to
start
,
and
,
as
if
he
be
call
away
,
disappear
on
a
sudden
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
earnestly
every
way
,
and
at
the
very
moment
that
this
man
direct
,
but
could
not
see
the
least
appearance
of
anything
;
but
so
positive
be
this
poor
man
,
that
he
give
the
people
the
vapour
in
abundance
,
and
send
them
away
tremble
and
fright
,
till
at
length
few
people
that
know
of
it
care
to
go
through
that
passage
,
and
hardly
anybody
by
night
on
any
account
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
this
ghost
,
as
the
poor
man
affirm
,
make
sign
to
the
house
,
and
to
the
ground
,
and
to
the
people
,
plainly
intimate
,
or
else
they
so
understand
it
,
that
abundance
of
the
people
should
come
to
be
bury
in
that
churchyard
,
as
indeed
happen
;
but
that
he
see
such
aspect
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
I
never
believe
,
nor
could
I
see
anything
of
it
myself
,
though
I
look
most
earnestly
to
see
it
,
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
serve
to
show
how
far
the
people
be
really
overcome
with
delusion
;
and
as
they
have
a
notion
of
the
approach
of
a
visitation
,
all
their
prediction
run
upon
a
most
dreadful
plague
,
which
should
lay
the
whole
city
,
and
even
the
kingdom
,
waste
,
and
should
destroy
almost
all
the
nation
,
both
man
and
beast
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
,
as
I
say
before
,
the
astrologer
add
story
of
the
conjunction
of
planet
in
a
malignant
manner
and
with
a
mischievous
influence
,
one
of
which
conjunction
be
to
happen
,
and
do
happen
,
in
October
,
and
the
other
in
November
;
and
they
fill
the
people
's
head
with
prediction
on
these
sign
of
the
heavens
,
intimate
that
those
conjunction
foretold
drought
,
famine
,
and
pestilence
.
<EOS>
in
the
two
first
of
them
,
however
,
they
be
entirely
mistaken
,
for
we
have
no
droughty
season
,
but
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
a
hard
frost
,
which
last
from
December
almost
to
March
,
and
after
that
moderate
weather
,
rather
warm
than
hot
,
with
refreshing
wind
,
and
,
in
short
,
very
seasonable
weather
,
and
also
several
very
great
rain
.
  
<EOS>
some
endeavour
be
use
to
suppress
the
printing
of
such
book
as
terrify
the
people
,
and
to
frighten
the
disperser
of
them
,
some
of
whom
be
take
up
;
but
nothing
be
do
in
it
,
as
I
be
inform
,
the
Government
be
unwilling
to
exasperate
the
people
,
who
be
,
as
I
may
say
,
all
out
of
their
wit
already
.
  
<EOS>
neither
can
I
acquit
those
minister
that
in
their
sermon
rather
sink
than
lift
up
the
heart
of
their
hearer
.
<EOS>
many
of
them
no
doubt
do
it
for
the
strengthening
the
resolution
of
the
people
,
and
especially
for
quicken
them
to
repentance
,
but
it
certainly
answer
not
their
end
,
at
least
not
in
proportion
to
the
injury
it
do
another
way
;
and
indeed
,
as
God
Himself
through
the
whole
scripture
rather
draw
to
Him
by
invitation
and
call
to
turn
to
Him
and
live
,
than
drive
us
by
terror
and
amazement
,
so
I
must
confess
I
think
the
minister
should
have
do
also
,
imitate
our
blessed
Lord
and
Master
in
this
,
that
His
whole
Gospel
be
full
of
declaration
from
heaven
of
God
's
mercy
,
and
His
readiness
to
receive
penitent
and
forgive
them
,
complain
,
"
Ye
will
not
come
unto
Me
that
ye
may
have
life
"
,
and
that
therefore
His
Gospel
be
call
the
Gospel
of
Peace
and
the
Gospel
of
Grace
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
have
some
good
man
,
and
that
of
all
persuasion
and
opinion
,
whose
discourse
be
full
of
terror
,
who
speak
nothing
but
dismal
thing
;
and
as
they
bring
the
people
together
with
a
kind
of
horror
,
send
them
away
in
tear
,
prophesy
nothing
but
evil
tiding
,
terrify
the
people
with
the
apprehension
of
be
utterly
destroy
,
not
guide
them
,
at
least
not
enough
,
to
cry
to
heaven
for
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
time
of
very
unhappy
breach
among
us
in
matter
of
religion
.
<EOS>
innumerable
sect
and
division
and
separate
opinion
prevail
among
the
people
.
<EOS>
the
Church
of
England
be
restore
,
indeed
,
with
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
,
about
four
year
before
;
but
the
minister
and
preacher
of
the
Presbyterians
and
Independents
,
and
of
all
the
other
sort
of
profession
,
have
begin
to
gather
separate
society
and
erect
altar
against
altar
,
and
all
those
have
their
meeting
for
worship
apart
,
as
they
have
now
,
but
not
so
many
then
,
the
Dissenters
be
not
thoroughly
form
into
a
body
as
they
be
since
;
and
those
congregation
which
be
thus
gather
together
be
yet
but
few
.
<EOS>
and
even
those
that
be
,
the
Government
do
not
allow
,
but
endeavour
to
suppress
them
and
shut
up
their
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
visitation
reconcile
them
again
,
at
least
for
a
time
,
and
many
of
the
good
and
most
valuable
minister
and
preacher
of
the
Dissenters
be
suffer
to
go
into
the
church
where
the
incumbent
be
flee
away
,
as
many
be
,
not
be
able
to
stand
it
;
and
the
people
flock
without
distinction
to
hear
them
preach
<EOS>
,
not
much
inquire
who
or
what
opinion
they
be
of
.
<EOS>
but
after
the
sickness
be
over
,
that
spirit
of
charity
abate
;
and
every
church
be
again
supply
with
their
own
minister
,
or
other
present
where
the
minister
be
dead
,
thing
return
to
their
old
channel
again
.
  
<EOS>
one
mischief
always
introduce
another
.
<EOS>
these
terror
and
apprehension
of
the
people
lead
them
into
a
thousand
weak
,
foolish
,
and
wicked
thing
,
which
they
want
not
a
sort
of
people
really
wicked
to
encourage
them
to
:
and
this
be
run
about
to
fortune
-
teller
,
cunning
-
man
,
and
astrologer
to
know
their
fortune
,
or
,
as
it
be
vulgarly
express
,
to
have
their
fortune
tell
them
,
their
nativity
calculate
,
and
the
like
;
and
this
folly
presently
make
the
town
swarm
with
a
wicked
generation
of
pretender
to
magic
,
to
the
black
art
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
;
nay
,
to
a
thousand
bad
dealing
with
the
devil
than
they
be
really
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
and
this
trade
grow
so
open
and
so
generally
practise
that
it
become
common
to
have
sign
and
inscription
set
up
at
door
:
<EOS>
"
here
live
a
fortune
-
teller
"
,
"
here
live
an
astrologer
"
,
"
here
you
may
have
your
nativity
calculate
"
,
and
the
like
;
and
Friar
Bacon
's
brazen
-
head
,
which
be
the
usual
sign
of
these
people
's
dwelling
,
be
to
be
see
almost
in
every
street
,
or
else
the
sign
of
Mother
Shipton
,
or
of
Merlin
's
head
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
with
what
blind
,
absurd
,
and
ridiculous
stuff
these
oracle
of
the
devil
please
and
satisfy
the
people
I
really
know
not
,
but
certain
it
be
that
innumerable
attendant
crowd
about
their
door
every
day
.
<EOS>
and
if
but
a
grave
fellow
in
a
velvet
jacket
,
a
band
,
and
a
black
coat
,
which
be
the
habit
those
quack
-
conjurer
generally
go
in
,
be
but
see
in
the
street
the
people
would
follow
them
in
crowd
,
and
ask
them
question
as
they
go
along
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
mention
what
a
horrid
delusion
this
be
,
or
what
it
tend
to
;
but
there
be
no
remedy
for
it
till
the
plague
itself
put
an
end
to
it
all
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
suppose
,
clear
the
town
of
most
of
those
calculator
themselves
.
<EOS>
one
mischief
be
,
that
if
the
poor
people
ask
these
mock
astrologer
whether
there
would
be
a
plague
or
no
,
they
all
agree
in
general
to
answer
"
yes
"
,
for
that
keep
up
their
trade
.
<EOS>
and
have
the
people
not
be
keep
in
a
fright
about
that
,
the
wizard
would
presently
have
be
render
useless
,
and
their
craft
have
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
but
they
always
talk
to
them
of
such
-
and
-
such
influence
of
the
star
,
of
the
conjunction
of
such
-
and
-
such
planet
,
which
must
necessarily
bring
sickness
and
distemper
,
and
consequently
the
plague
.
<EOS>
and
some
have
the
assurance
to
tell
them
the
plague
be
begin
already
,
which
be
too
true
,
though
they
that
say
so
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
the
minister
,
to
do
them
justice
,
and
preacher
of
most
sort
that
be
serious
and
understanding
person
,
thunder
against
these
and
other
wicked
practice
,
and
expose
the
folly
as
well
as
the
wickedness
of
them
together
,
and
the
most
sober
and
judicious
people
despise
and
abhor
them
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
make
any
impression
upon
the
middling
people
and
the
working
labour
poor
.
<EOS>
Their
fear
be
predominant
over
all
their
passion
,
and
they
throw
away
their
money
in
a
most
distracted
manner
upon
those
whimsy
.
<EOS>
maid
-
servant
especially
,
and
man
-
servant
,
be
the
chief
of
their
customer
,
and
their
question
generally
be
,
after
the
first
demand
of
"
Will
there
be
a
plague
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
the
next
question
be
,
"
oh
,
sir
I
for
the
Lord
's
sake
<EOS>
,
what
will
become
of
me
?
<EOS>
Will
my
mistress
keep
me
,
or
will
she
turn
me
off
?
<EOS>
Will
she
stay
here
,
or
will
she
go
into
the
country
?
<EOS>
and
if
she
go
into
the
country
,
will
she
take
me
with
her
,
or
leave
me
here
to
be
starve
and
undone
?
"
<EOS>
and
the
like
of
manservant
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
the
case
of
poor
servant
be
very
dismal
,
as
I
shall
have
occasion
to
mention
again
by
-
and
-
by
,
for
it
be
apparent
a
prodigious
number
of
them
would
be
turn
away
,
and
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
and
of
them
abundance
perish
,
and
particularly
of
those
that
these
false
prophet
have
flatter
with
hope
that
they
should
be
continue
in
their
service
,
and
carry
with
their
master
and
mistresse
into
the
country
;
and
have
not
public
charity
provide
for
these
poor
creature
,
whose
number
be
exceed
great
and
<EOS>
in
all
case
of
this
nature
must
be
so
<EOS>
,
they
would
have
be
in
the
bad
condition
of
any
people
in
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
agitate
the
mind
of
the
common
people
for
many
month
,
while
the
first
apprehension
be
upon
them
,
and
while
the
plague
be
not
,
as
I
may
say
,
yet
break
out
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
also
not
forget
that
the
more
serious
part
of
the
inhabitant
behave
after
another
manner
.
<EOS>
the
Government
encourage
their
devotion
,
and
appoint
public
prayer
and
day
of
fasting
and
humiliation
,
to
make
public
confession
of
sin
and
implore
the
mercy
of
God
to
avert
the
dreadful
judgement
which
hang
over
their
head
;
and
it
be
not
to
be
express
with
what
alacrity
the
people
of
all
persuasion
embrace
the
occasion
;
how
they
flock
to
the
church
and
meeting
,
and
they
be
all
so
thronged
that
there
be
often
no
come
near
,
no
,
not
to
the
very
door
of
the
large
church
.
<EOS>
also
there
be
daily
prayer
appoint
morning
and
evening
at
several
church
,
and
day
of
private
praying
at
other
place
;
at
all
which
the
people
attend
,
I
say
,
with
an
uncommon
devotion
.
<EOS>
several
private
family
also
,
as
well
of
one
opinion
as
of
another
,
keep
family
fast
,
to
which
they
admit
their
near
relation
only
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
those
people
who
be
really
serious
and
religious
apply
themselves
in
a
truly
christian
manner
to
the
proper
work
of
repentance
and
humiliation
,
as
a
christian
people
ought
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
the
public
show
that
they
would
bear
their
share
in
these
thing
;
the
very
Court
,
which
be
then
gay
and
luxurious
,
put
on
a
face
of
just
concern
for
the
public
danger
.
<EOS>
all
the
play
and
interlude
which
,
after
the
manner
of
the
French
Court
,
have
be
set
up
,
and
begin
to
increase
among
us
,
be
forbid
to
act
;
the
gaming
-
table
,
public
dancing
-
room
,
and
music
-
house
,
which
multiply
and
begin
to
debauch
the
manner
of
the
people
,
be
shut
up
and
suppress
;
and
the
jack
-
puddings
,
merry
-
andrews
,
puppet
-
show
,
rope
-
dancer
,
and
such
-
like
doing
,
which
have
bewitch
the
poor
common
people
,
shut
up
their
shop
,
find
indeed
no
trade
;
for
the
mind
of
the
people
be
agitate
with
other
thing
,
and
a
kind
of
sadness
and
horror
at
these
thing
sit
upon
the
countenance
even
of
the
common
people
.
<EOS>
death
be
before
their
eye
,
and
everybody
begin
to
think
of
their
grave
,
not
of
mirth
and
diversion
.
  
<EOS>
but
even
those
wholesome
reflection
 
which
,
rightly
manage
,
would
have
most
happily
lead
the
people
to
fall
upon
their
knee
,
make
confession
of
their
sin
,
and
look
up
to
their
merciful
Saviour
for
pardon
,
implore
His
compassion
on
them
in
such
a
time
of
their
distress
,
by
which
we
may
have
be
as
a
second
Nineveh
 
have
a
quite
contrary
extreme
in
the
common
people
,
who
,
ignorant
and
stupid
in
their
reflection
as
they
be
brutishly
wicked
and
thoughtless
before
,
be
now
lead
by
their
fright
to
extreme
of
folly
;
and
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
that
they
run
to
conjurer
and
witch
,
and
all
sort
of
deceiver
,
to
know
what
should
become
of
them
(
who
feed
their
fear
,
and
keep
them
always
alarmed
and
awake
on
purpose
to
delude
them
and
pick
their
pocket
)
,
so
they
be
as
mad
upon
their
running
after
quack
and
mountebank
,
and
every
practise
old
woman
,
for
medicine
and
remedy
;
store
themselves
with
such
multitude
of
pill
,
potion
,
and
preservative
,
as
they
be
call
,
that
they
not
only
spend
their
money
but
even
poison
themselves
beforehand

<EOS>
Tis
sufficient
from
these
to
apprise
any
one
of
the
humour
of
those
time

and
how
a
set
of
thief
and
pickpocket
not
only
rob
and
cheat
the
poor
people
of
their
money
,
but
poison
their
body
with
odious

fatal
preparation

some
with
mercury

some
with
other
thing
as
bad
,
perfectly
remote
from
the
thing
pretend
to
,
and
rather
hurtful
than
serviceable
to
the
body
in
case
an
infection
follow

<EOS>
I
can
not
omit
a
subtility
of
one
of
those
quack
operator
,
with
which
he
gull
the
poor
people
to
crowd
about
him
,
but
do
nothing
for

without
money

He
have
,
it
seem
,
add
to
his
bill
,
which
he
give
about
the
street
,
this
advertisement
in
capital
letter
,
viz

,
"
He
give
advice

<EOS>
abundance
of
poor
people
come
to
him
accordingly

to
whom
he
make
a
great
many
fine
speech
,
examine
them
of
the
state
of
their
health
and
of
the
constitution
of
their

,
and
tell
them
many
good
thing
for
them
to
do
,
which
be
of
no
great
moment

<EOS>
but
the
issue
and
conclusion
of
all
be
,
that
he
have
a
preparation
which
if
they
take
such
a
quantity
of
every
morning
,
he
would
pawn
his
life
they
should
never
have
the

no

they
live
in

with
people

be
infect

<EOS>
this
make
the

all
resolve

have
it
;

then
the
price

that
be

much

I

'
twas
half

a

crown

<EOS>
here
the
woman
begin
to
give
him
ill
word

stand
at

all
that

tell
her
tale

all
the

come

till
the

find
she
turn
away
his

be
oblige
to
call
her
upstairs
again

give
her
his
box
of
physic

nothing

which
perhaps
,
too
,
be
good
for
nothing
when
she
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
people
,
whose
confusion
fit
them
to
be
impose
upon
by
all
sort
of
pretender
and
by
every
mountebank
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
but
these
quack
sort
of
fellow
raise
great
gain
out
of
the
miserable
people
,
for
we
daily
find
the
crowd
that
run
after
them
be
infinitely
great
,
and
their
door
be
more
thronged
than
those
of
Dr
Brooks

Dr
Upton

Dr
Hodges

Dr
Berwick
,
or
any
,
though
the
most
famous
man
of
the
time

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
and
I
be
tell
that
some
of
them
get
five
pound
a
day
by
their
physic
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
another
madness
beyond
all
this
,
which
may
serve
to
give
an
idea
of
the
distracted
humour
of
the
poor
people
at
that
time
:
and
this
be
their
follow
a
bad
sort
of
deceiver
than
any
of
these
;
for
these
petty
thief
only
delude
them
to
pick
their
pocket
and
get
their
money
,
in
which
their
wickedness
,
whatever
it
be
,
lie
chiefly
on
the
side
of
the
deceiver
,
not
upon
the
deceive
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
part
I
be
go
to
mention
,
it
lie
chiefly
in
the
people
deceive
,
or
equally
in
both
;
and
this
be
in
wear
charm
,
philtre
,
exorcism
,
amulet
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
preparation
,
to
fortify
the
body
with
them
against
the
plague
;
as
if
the
plague
be
not
the
hand
of
God
,
but
a
kind
of
possession
of
an
evil
spirit
,
and
that
it
be
to
be
keep
off
with
crossing
,
sign
of
the
zodiac
,
paper
tie
up
with
so
many
knot

and
certain
word

figure
write
on

I
may
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
in
my
exclamation
against
the
folly
,
and
indeed
the
wickedness
,
of
those
thing
,
in
a
time
of
such
danger
,
in
a
matter
of
such
consequence
as
this
,
of
a
national
infection
.
<EOS>
but
my
memorandum
of
these
thing
relate
rather
to
take
notice
only
of
the
fact
,
and
mention
only
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
how
the
poor
people
find
the
insufficiency
of
those
thing
,
and
how
many
of
them
be
afterwards
carry
away
in
the
dead
-
cart
and
throw
into
the
common
grave
of
every
parish
with
these
hellish
charm
and
trumpery
hang
about
their
neck
,
remain
to
be
speak
of
as
we
go
along
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
the
effect
of
the
hurry
the
people
be
in
,
after
the
first
notion
of
the
plaque
be
at
hand
be
among
them
,
and
which
may
be
say
to
be
from
about
Michaelmas
1664
,
but
more
particularly
after
the
two
man
die
in
St
Giles
's
in
the
beginning
of
December
;
and
again
,
after
another
alarm
in
February
.
<EOS>
for
when
the
plague
evidently
spread
itself
,
they
soon
begin
to
see
the
folly
of
trust
to
those
unperforme
creature
who
have
gull
them
of
their
money
;
and
then
their
fear
work
another
way
,
namely
,
to
amazement
and
stupidity
,
not
know
what
course
to
take
or
what
to
do
either
to
help
or
relieve
themselves
.
<EOS>
but
they
run
about
from
one
neighbour
's
house
to
another
,
and
even
in
the
street
from
one
door
to
another
,
with
repeated
cry
of
,
"
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
poor
people
be
to
be
pity
in
one
particular
thing
in
which
they
have
little
or
no
relief
,
and
which
I
desire
to
mention
with
a
serious
awe
and
reflection
,
which
perhaps
every
one
that
read
this
may
not
relish
;
namely
,
that
whereas
death
now
begin
not
,
as
we
may
say
,
to
hover
over
every
one
's
head
only
,
but
to
look
into
their
house
and
chamber
and
stare
in
their
face
.
<EOS>
though
there
may
be
some
stupidity
and
dulness
of
the
mind
(
and
there
be
so
,
a
great
deal
)
,
yet
there
be
a
great
deal
of
just
alarm
sound
into
the
very
inmost
soul
,
if
I
may
so
say
,
of
other
.
<EOS>
many
conscience
be
awaken
;
many
hard
heart
melt
into
tear
;
many
a
penitent
confession
be
make
of
crime
long
conceal
.
<EOS>
It
would
wound
the
soul
of
any
Christian
to
have
hear
the
die
groan
of
many
a
despairing
creature
,
and
none
durst
come
near
to
comfort
them
.
<EOS>
many
a
robbery
,
many
a
murder
,
be
then
confess
aloud
,
and
nobody
survive
to
record
the
account
of
it
.
<EOS>
People
may
be
hear
,
even
into
the
street
as
we
pass
along
,
call
upon
God
for
mercy
through
Jesus
Christ
,
and
say
,
"
I
have
be
a
thief
,
"
I
have
be
an
adulterer
'
,
"
I
have
be
a
murderer
"
,
and
the
like
,
and
none
durst
stop
to
make
the
least
inquiry
into
such
thing
or
to
administer
comfort
to
the
poor
creature
that
in
the
anguish
both
of
soul
and
body
thus
cry
out
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
minister
do
visit
the
sick
at
first
and
for
a
little
while
,
but
it
be
not
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
present
death
to
have
go
into
some
house
.
<EOS>
the
very
burier
of
the
dead
,
who
be
the
hardened
creature
in
town
,
be
sometimes
beat
back
and
so
terrified
that
they
durst
not
go
into
house
where
the
whole
family
be
sweep
away
together
,
and
where
the
circumstance
be
more
particularly
horrible
,
as
some
be
;
but
this
be
,
indeed
,
at
the
first
heat
of
the
distemper
.
  
<EOS>
Time
inure
them
to
it
all
,
and
they
venture
everywhere
afterwards
without
hesitation
,
as
I
shall
have
occasion
to
mention
at
large
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
suppose
now
the
plague
to
be
begin
,
as
I
have
say
,
and
that
the
magistrate
begin
to
take
the
condition
of
the
people
into
their
serious
consideration
.
<EOS>
what
they
do
as
to
the
regulation
of
the
inhabitant
and
of
infect
family
,
I
shall
speak
to
by
itself
;
but
as
to
the
affair
of
health
,
it
be
proper
to
mention
it
here
that
,
have
see
the
foolish
humour
of
the
people
in
run
after
quack
and
mountebank
,
wizard
and
fortune
-
teller
,
which
they
do
as
above
,
even
to
madness
,
the
Lord
Mayor
,
a
very
sober
and
religious
gentleman
,
appoint
physician
and
surgeon
for
relief
of
the
poor
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
disease
poor
and
in
particular
order
the
College
of
Physicians
to
publish
direction
for
cheap
remedy
for
the
poor
,
in
all
the
circumstance
of
the
distemper
.
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
be
one
of
the
most
charitable
and
judicious
thing
that
could
be
do
at
that
time
,
for
this
drive
the
people
from
haunt
the
door
of
every
disperser
of
bill
,
and
from
take
down
blindly
and
without
consideration
poison
for
physic
and
death
instead
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
this
direction
of
the
physician
be
do
by
a
consultation
of
the
whole
College
;
and
,
as
it
be
particularly
calculate
for
the
use
of
the
poor
and
for
cheap
medicine
,
it
be
make
public
,
so
that
everybody
may
see
it
,
and
copy
be
give
gratis
to
all
that
desire
it
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
public
,
and
to
be
see
on
all
occasion
,
I
need
not
give
the
reader
of
this
the
trouble
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
suppose
to
lessen
the
authority
or
capacity
of
the
physician
when
I
say
that
the
violence
of
the
distemper
,
when
it
come
to
its
extremity
,
be
like
the
fire
the
next
year
.
<EOS>
the
fire
,
which
consume
what
the
plague
could
not
touch
,
defy
all
the
application
of
remedy
;
the
fire
-
engine
be
break
,
the
bucket
throw
away
,
and
the
power
of
man
be
baffle
and
bring
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
so
the
Plague
defy
all
medicine
;
the
very
physician
be
seize
with
it
,
with
their
preservative
in
their
mouth
;
and
man
go
about
prescribe
to
other
and
tell
them
what
to
do
till
the
token
be
upon
them
,
and
they
drop
down
dead
,
destroy
by
that
very
enemy
they
direct
other
to
oppose
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
of
several
physician
,
even
some
of
them
the
most
eminent
,
and
of
several
of
the
most
skilful
surgeon
.
<EOS>
abundance
of
quack
too
die
,
who
have
the
folly
to
trust
to
their
own
medicine
,
which
they
must
needs
be
conscious
to
themselves
be
good
for
nothing
,
and
who
rather
ought
,
like
other
sort
of
thief
,
to
have
run
away
,
sensible
of
their
guilt
,
from
the
justice
that
they
could
not
but
expect
should
punish
them
as
they
know
they
have
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
it
be
any
derogation
from
the
labour
or
application
of
the
physician
to
say
they
fall
in
the
common
calamity
;
nor
be
it
so
intend
by
me
;
it
rather
be
to
their
praise
that
they
venture
their
life
so
far
as
even
to
lose
them
in
the
service
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
They
endeavour
to
do
good
,
and
to
save
the
life
of
other
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
not
to
expect
that
the
physician
could
stop
God
's
judgement
,
or
prevent
a
distemper
eminently
armed
from
heaven
from
execute
the
errand
it
be
send
about
.
  
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
the
physician
assist
many
by
their
skill
,
and
by
their
prudence
and
application
,
to
the
saving
of
their
life
and
restore
their
health
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
lessen
their
character
or
their
skill
,
to
say
they
could
not
cure
those
that
have
the
token
upon
them
,
or
those
who
be
mortally
infect
before
the
physician
be
send
for
,
as
be
frequently
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
It
remain
to
mention
now
what
public
measure
be
take
by
the
magistrate
for
the
general
safety
,
and
to
prevent
the
spreading
of
the
distemper
,
when
it
first
break
out
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
frequent
occasion
to
speak
of
the
prudence
of
the
magistrate
,
their
charity
,
their
vigilance
for
the
poor
,
and
for
preserve
good
order
,
furnish
provision
,
and
the
like
,
when
the
plague
be
increase
,
as
it
afterwards
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
now
upon
the
order
and
regulation
they
publish
for
the
government
of
infected
family
.
  
<EOS>
I
mention
above
shut
of
house
up
;
and
it
be
needful
to
say
something
particularly
to
that
,
for
this
part
of
the
history
of
the
plague
be
very
melancholy
,
but
the
most
grievous
story
must
be
tell
.
  
<EOS>
about
June
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
and
the
Court
of
Aldermen
,
as
I
have
say
,
begin
more
particularly
to
concern
themselves
for
the
regulation
of
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
of
peace
for
Middlesex
,
by
direction
of
the
Secretary
of
State
,
have
begin
to
shut
up
house
in
the
parish
of
St
Giles
-
in
-
the
-
Fields
,
St
Martin
,
St
Clement
Danes
,
&
c.
,
and
it
be
with
good
success
;
for
in
several
street
where
the
plague
break
out
,
upon
strict
guard
the
house
that
be
infect
,
and
take
care
to
bury
those
that
die
immediately
after
they
be
know
to
be
dead
,
the
plague
cease
in
those
street
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
observe
that
the
plague
decrease
sooner
in
those
parish
after
they
have
be
visit
to
the
full
than
it
do
in
the
parish
of
Bishopsgate
,
Shoreditch
,
Aldgate
,
Whitechappel
,
Stepney
,
and
other
;
the
early
care
take
in
that
manner
be
a
great
mean
to
the
put
a
check
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
shutting
up
of
house
be
a
method
first
take
,
as
I
understand
,
in
the
plague
which
happen
in
1603
,
at
the
coming
of
King
James
the
First
to
the
crown
;
and
the
power
of
shut
people
up
in

can

many
that
complain

find

inspection

be

the
locking
up

's

,

set

watchman
there
night

day
to
prevent
their
stir
out

any
come

when
perhaps
the
sound
people
in

family
may
have
escape
if
they
have
be
remove
from

look
very
hard

cruel

and
many

perish
in

miserable
confinement
which
,
'
tis
reasonable

would
not
have
be
distemper
if
they
have
have
liberty

though
the

be

house

at
which
the
people
be
very
clamorous

at

several
violence
be
commit

offer

fill

indeed

be

be

gather
together

to
stay
long
together
when
they
be
there
;
nor
do
I
stay
long
there

<EOS>
but
the
outcry
be
loud
enough
to
prompt
my
curiosity
,

I
call
to
one
that
look
out

,
and
ask
what
be
the
matter

<EOS>
a

,
it
seem

have
be
employ

keep
his
post
at

be
infect

or
say
to
be
infect

and
be
shut
up

<EOS>
He
have
be
there
all
night
for
two
night
together

as
he
tell

watchman
have
be

be

him

nothing
,
send
him
of
no
errand
,
which
use
to
be
the
chief
business
of
the
watchman
;
neither
have
they
give
him
any
disturbance
,
as
he
say
,
from
the
Monday
afternoon
,
when
he
hear
great
crying
and
scream
in
the
house
,
which
,
as
he
suppose
,
be
occasion
by
some
of
the
family
die
just
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
the
night
before
,
the
dead
-
cart
,
as
it
be
call
,
have
be
stop
there
,
and
a
servant
-
maid
have
be
bring
down
to
the
door
dead
,
and
the
burier
or
bearer
,
as
they
be
call
,
put
her
into
the
cart
,
wrapt
only
in
a
green
rug
,
and
carry
her
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
watchman
have
knock
at
the
door
,
it
seem
,
when
he
hear
that
noise
and
cry
,
as
above
,
and
nobody
answer
a
great
while
;
but
at
last
one
look
out
and
say
with
an
angry
,
quick
tone
,
and
yet
a
kind
of
cry
voice
,
or
a
voice
of
one
that
be
cry
,
"
what
d'ye
want
,
that
ye
make
such
a
knocking
?
"
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
I
be
the
watchman
!
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
the
person
answer
,
"
what
be
that
to
you
?
<EOS>
stop
the
dead
-
cart
.
<EOS>
"
this
,
it
seem
,
be
about
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
soon
after
,
as
the
fellow
say
,
he
stop
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
then
knock
again
,
but
nobody
answer
.
<EOS>
He
continue
knock
,
and
the
bellman
call
out
several
time
,
"
bring
out
your
dead
"
;
but
nobody
answer
,
till
the
man
that
drive
the
cart
,
be
call
to
other
house
,
would
stay
no
longer
,
and
drive
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
watchman
know
not
what
to
make
of
all
this
,
so
he
let
them
alone
till
the
morning
-
man
or
day
-
watchman
,
as
they
call
him
,
come
to
relieve
him
.
<EOS>
give
him
an
account
of
the
particular
,
they
knock
at
the
door
a
great
while
,
but
nobody
answer
;
and
they
observe
that
the
window
or
casement
at
which
the
person
have
look
out
who
have
answer
before
continue
open
,
be
up
two
pair
of
stair
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
the
two
man
,
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
,
get
a
long
ladder
,
and
one
of
them
go
up
to
the
window
and
look
into
the
room
,
where
he
see
a
woman
lie
dead
upon
the
floor
in
a
dismal
manner
,
have
no
clothe
on
her
<EOS>
but
her
shift
.
<EOS>
but
though
he
call
aloud
,
and
put
in
his
long
staff
,
knock
hard
on
the
floor
,
yet
nobody
stir
or
answer
;
neither
could
he
hear
any
noise
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
down
again
upon
this
,
and
acquaint
his
fellow
,
who
go
up
also
;
and
find
it
just
so
,
they
resolve
to
acquaint
either
the
Lord
Mayor
or
some
other
magistrate
of
it
,
but
do
not
offer
to
go
in
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
,
it
seem
,
upon
the
information
of
the
two
man
,
order
the
house
to
be
break
open
,
a
constable
and
other
person
be
appoint
to
be
present
,
that
nothing
may
be
plunder
;
and
accordingly
it
be
so
do
,
when
nobody
be
find
in
the
house
but
that
young
woman
,
who
have
be
infect
and
past
recovery
,
the
rest
have
leave
her
to
die
by
herself
,
and
be
every
one
go
,
have
find
some
way
to
delude
the
watchman
,
and
to
get
open
the
door
,
or
get
out
at
some
back
-
door
,
or
over
the
top
of
the
house
,
so
that
he
know
nothing
of
it
;
and
as
to
those
cry
and
shriek
which
he
hear
,
it
be
suppose
they
be
the
passionate
cry
of
the
family
at
the
bitter
parting
,
which
,
to
be
sure
,
it
be
to
them
all
,
this
be
the
sister
to
the
mistress
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
the
house
,
his
wife
,
several
child
,
and
servant
,
be
all
go
and
flee
,
whether
sick
or
sound
,
that
I
could
never
learn
;
nor
,
indeed
,
do
I
make
much
inquiry
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
many
such
escape
be
make
out
of
infected
house
,
as
particularly
when
the
watchman
be
send
of
some
errand
;
for
it
be
his
business
to
go
of
any
errand
that
the
family
send
him
of
;
that
be
to
say
,
for
necessary
,
such
as
food
and
physic
;
to
fetch
physician
,
if
they
would
come
,
or
surgeon
,
or
nurse
,
or
to
order
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
the
like
;
but
with
this
condition
,
too
,
that
when
he
go
he
be
to
lock
up
the
outer
door
of
the
house
and
take
the
key
away
with
him
,
to
evade
this
,
and
cheat
the
watchman
,
people
get
two
or
three
key
make
to
their
lock
,
or
they
find
way
to
unscrew
the
lock
such
as
be
screw
on
,
and
so
take
off
the
lock
,
be
in
the
inside
of
the
house
,
and
while
they
send
away
the
watchman
to
the
market
,
to
the
bakehouse
,
or
for
one
trifle
or
another
,
open
the
door
and
go
out
as
often
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
but
this
being
find
out
,
the
officer
afterwards
have
order
to
padlock
up
the
door
on
the
outside
,
and
place
bolt
on
them
as
they
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
at
another
house
,
as
I
be
inform
,
in
the
street
next
within
Aldgate
,
a
whole
family
be
shut
up
and
lock
in
because
the
maid
-
servant
be
take
sick
.
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
house
have
complain
by
his
friend
to
the
next
alderman
and
to
the
Lord
Mayor
,
and
have
consent
to
have
the
maid
carry
to
the
pest
-
house
,
but
be
refuse
;
so
the
door
be
mark
with
a
red
cross
,
a
padlock
on
the
outside
,
as
above
,
and
a
watchman
set
to
keep
the
door
,
accord
to
public
order
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
master
of
the
house
find
there
be
no
remedy
,
but
that
he
,
his
wife
,
and
his
child
be
to
be
lock
up
with
this
poor
distemper
servant
,
he
call
to
the
watchman
,
and
tell
him
he
must
go
then
and
fetch
a
nurse
for
them
to
attend
this
poor
girl
,
for
that
it
would
be
certain
death
to
them
all
to
oblige
them
to
nurse
her
;
and
tell
him
plainly
that
if
he
would
not
do
this
,
the
maid
must
perish
either
of
the
distemper
or
be
starve
for
want
of
food
,
for
he
be
resolve
none
of
his
family
should
go
near
her
;
and
she
lie
in
the
garret
four
storey
high
,
where
she
could
not
cry
out
,
or
call
to
anybody
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
the
watchman
consent
to
that
,
and
go
and
fetch
a
nurse
,
as
he
be
appoint
,
and
bring
her
to
them
the
same
evening
.
<EOS>
during
this
interval
the
master
of
the
house
take
his
opportunity
to
break
a
large
hole
through
his
shop
into
a
bulk
or
stall
,
where
formerly
a
cobbler
have
sit
,
before
or
under
his
shop
-
window
;
but
the
tenant
,
as
may
be
suppose
at
such
a
dismal
time
as
that
,
be
dead
or
remove
,
and
so
he
have
the
key
in
his
own
keeping
.
<EOS>
have
make
his
way
into
this
stall
,
which
he
could
not
have
do
if
the
man
have
be
at
the
door
,
the
noise
he
be
oblige
to
make
be
such
as
would
have
alarm
the
watchman
;
I
say
,
have
make
his
way
into
this
stall
,
he
sit
still
till
the
watchman
return
with
the
nurse
,
and
all
the
next
day
also
.
<EOS>
but
the
night
follow
,
have
contrive
to
send
the
watchman
of
another
trifling
errand
,
which
,
as
I
take
it
,
be
to
an
apothecary
's
for
a
plaister
for
the
maid
,
which
he
be
to
stay
for
the
making
up
,
or
some
other
such
errand
that
may
secure
his
staying
some
time
;
in
that
time
he
convey
himself
and
all
his
family
out
of
the
house
,
and
leave
the
nurse
and
the
watchman
to
bury
the
poor
wench
 
that
is
,
throw
her
into
the
cart
 
and
take
care
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
give
a
great
many
such
story
as
these
,
divert
enough
,
which
in
the
long
course
of
that
dismal
year
I
meet
with
 
that
is
,
hear
of
 
and
which
be
very
certain
to
be
true
,
or
very
near
the
truth
;
that
be
to
say
,
true
in
the
general
:
for
no
man
could
at
such
a
time
learn
all
the
particular
.
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
violence
use
with
the
watchman
,
as
be
report
,
in
abundance
of
place
;
and
I
believe
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
visitation
to
the
end
,
there
be
not
less
than
eighteen
or
twenty
of
them
kill
,
or
so
wounded
as
to
be
take
up
for
dead
,
which
be
suppose
to
be
do
by
the
people
in
the
infected
house
which
be
shut
up
,
and
where
they
attempt
to
come
out
and
be
oppose
.
  
<EOS>
nor
,
indeed
,
could
less
be
expect
,
for
here
be
so
many
prison
in
the
town
as
there
be
house
shut
up
;
and
as
the
people
shut
up
or
imprison
so
be
guilty
of
no
crime
,
only
shut
up
<EOS>
because
miserable
,
it
be
really
the
more
intolerable
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
also
this
difference
,
that
every
prison
,
as
we
may
call
it
,
have
but
one
jailer
,
and
as
he
have
the
whole
house
to
guard
,
and
that
many
house
be
so
situate
as
that
they
have
several
way
out
,
some
more
,
some
less
,
and
some
into
several
street
,
it
be
impossible
for
one
man
so
to
guard
all
the
passage
as
to
prevent
the
escape
of
people
make
desperate
by
the
fright
of
their
circumstance
,
by
the
resentment
of
their
usage
,
or
by
the
raging
of
the
distemper
itself
;
so
that
they
would
talk
to
the
watchman
on
one
side
of
the
house
,
while
the
family
make
their
escape
at
another
.
  
<EOS>
for
example
,
in
Coleman
Street
there
be
abundance
of
alley
,
as
appear
still
.
<EOS>
a
house
be
shut
up
in
that
they
call
White
's
Alley
;
and
this
house
have
a
back
-
window
,
not
a
door
,
into
a
court
which
have
a
passage
into
Bell
Alley
.
<EOS>
a
watchman
be
set
by
the
constable
at
the
door
of
this
house
,
and
there
he
stand
,
or
his
comrade
,
night
and
day
,
while
the
family
go
all
away
in
the
evening
out
at
that
window
into
the
court
,
and
leave
the
poor
fellow
ward
and
watch
for
near
a
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
not
far
from
the
same
place
they
blow
up
a
watchman
with
gunpowder
,
and
burn
the
poor
fellow
dreadfully
;
and
while
he
make
hideous
cry
,
and
nobody
would
venture
to
come
near
to
help
him
,
the
whole
family
that
be
able
to
stir
get
out
at
the
window
<EOS>
one
storey
high
,
two
that
be
leave
sick
call
out
for
help
.
<EOS>
care
be
take
to
give
them
nurse
to
look
after
them
,
but
the
person
flee
be
never
find
,
till
after
the
plague
be
abate
they
return
;
but
as
nothing
could
be
prove
,
so
nothing
could
be
do
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
consider
,
too
,
that
as
these
be
prison
without
bar
and
bolt
,
which
our
common
prison
be
furnish
with
,
so
the
people
let
themselves
down
out
of
their
window
,
even
in
the
face
of
the
watchman
,
bring
sword
or
pistol
in
their
hand
,
and
threaten
the
poor
wretch
to
shoot
him
if
he
stir
or
call
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
in
other
case
,
some
have
garden
,
and
wall
or
pale
,
between
them
and
their
neighbour
,
or
yard
and
back
-
house
;
and
these
,
by
friendship
and
entreaty
,
would
get
leave
to
get
over
those
wall
or
pale
,
and
so
go
out
at
their
neighbour
'
door
;
or
,
by
give
money
to
their
servant
,
get
them
to
let
them
through
in
the
night
;
so
that
in
short
,
the
shutting
up
of
house
be
in
no
wise
to
be
depend
upon
.
<EOS>
neither
do
it
answer
the
end
at
all
,
serve
more
to
make
the
people
desperate
,
and
drive
them
to
such
extremity
as
that
they
would
break
out
at
all
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
and
that
which
be
still
bad
,
those
that
do
thus
break
out
spread
the
infection
farther
by
their
wander
about
with
the
distemper
upon
them
,
in
their
desperate
circumstance
,
than
they
would
otherwise
have
do
;
for
whoever
consider
all
the
particular
in
such
case
must
acknowledge
,
and
we
can
not
doubt
but
the
severity
of
those
confinement
make
many
people
desperate
,
and
make
them
run
out
of
their
house
at
all
hazard
,
and
with
the
plague
visibly
upon
them
,
not
know
either
whither
to
go
or
what
to
do
,
or
,
indeed
,
what
they
do
;
and
many
that
do
so
be
drive
to
dreadful
exigency
and
extremity
,
and
perish
in
the
street
or
field
for
mere
want
,
or
drop
down
by
the
rage
violence
of
the
fever
upon
them
.
<EOS>
other
wander
into
the
country
,
and
go
forward
any
way
,
as
their
desperation
guide
them
,
not
know
whither
they
go
or
would
go
:
till
,
faint
and
tired
,
and
not
get
any
relief
,
the
house
and
village
on
the
road
refuse
to
admit
them
to
lodge
whether
infect
or
no
,
they
have
perish
by
the
roadside
or
get
into
barn
and
die
there
,
none
dare
to
come
to
them
or
relieve
them
,
though
perhaps
not
infect
,
for
nobody
would
believe
them
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
when
the
plague
at
first
seize
a
family
that
be
to
say
,
when
any
body
of
the
family
have
go
out
and
unwarily
or
otherwise
catch
the
distemper
and
bring
it
home
 
<EOS>
it
be
certainly
know
by
the
family
before
it
be
know
to
the
officer
,
who
,
as
you
will
see
by
the
order
,
be
appoint
to
examine
into
the
circumstance
of
all
sick
person
when
they
hear
of
their
be
sick
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
interval
,
between
their
be
take
sick
and
the
examiner
come
,
the
master
of
the
house
have
leisure
and
liberty
to
remove
himself
or
all
his
family
,
if
he
know
whither
to
go
,
and
many
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
the
great
disaster
be
that
many
do
thus
after
they
be
really
infect
themselves
,
and
so
carry
the
disease
into
the
house
of
those
who
be
so
hospitable
as
to
receive
them
;
which
,
it
must
be
confess
,
be
very
cruel
and
ungrateful
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
in
part
the
reason
of
the
general
notion
,
or
scandal
rather
,
which
go
about
of
the
temper
of
people
infect
:
namely
,
that
they
do
not
take
the
least
care
or
make
any
scruple
of
infect
other
,
though
I
can
not
say
but
there
may
be
some
truth
in
it
too
,
but
not
so
general
as
be
report
.
<EOS>
what
natural
reason
could
be
give
for
so
wicked
a
thing
at
a
time
when
they
may
conclude
themselves
just
go
to
appear
at
the
bar
of
divine
justice
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
satisfied
that
it
can
not
be
reconcile
to
religion
and
principle
any
more
than
it
can
be
to
generosity
and
humanity
,
but
I
may
speak
of
that
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
speak
now
of
people
make
desperate
by
the
apprehension
of
their
being
shut
up
,
and
their
breaking
out
by
stratagem
or
force
,
either
before
or
after
they
be
shut
up
,
whose
misery
be
not
lessen
when
they
be
out
,
but
sadly
increase
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
many
that
thus
get
away
have
retreat
to
go
to
and
<EOS>
other
house
,
where
they
lock
themselves
up
and
keep
hide
till
the
plague
be
over
;
and
many
family
,
<EOS>
foresee
the
approach
of
the
distemper
,
lay
up
store
of
provision
sufficient
for
their
whole
family
,
and
shut
themselves
up
,
and
that
so
entirely
that
they
be
neither
see
or
hear
of
till
the
infection
be
quite
cease
,
and
then
come
abroad
sound
and
well
.
<EOS>
I
may
recollect
several
such
as
these
,
and
give
you
the
particular
of
their
management
;
for
doubtless
it
be
the
most
effectual
secure
step
that
could
be
take
for
such
whose
circumstance
would
not
admit
them
to
remove
,
or
who
have
not
retreat
abroad
proper
for
the
case
;
for
in
be
thus
shut
up
they
be
as
if
they
have
be
a
hundred
mile
off
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
remember
that
any
one
of
those
family
miscarry
.
<EOS>
among
these
,
several
dutch
merchant
be
particularly
remarkable
,
who
keep
their
house
like
little
garrison
besiege
suffer
none
to
go
in
or
out
or
come
near
them
,
particularly
one
in
a
court
in
Throgmorton
Street
whose
house
look
into
Draper
's
Garden
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
come
back
to
the
case
of
family
infect
and
shut
up
by
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
the
misery
of
those
family
be
not
to
be
express
;
and
it
be
generally
in
such
house
that
we
hear
the
most
dismal
shriek
and
outcry
of
the
poor
people
,
terrified
and
even
fright
to
death
by
the
sight
of
the
condition
of
their
dear
relation
,
and
by
the
terror
of
be
imprison
as
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
,
and
while
I
be
write
this
story
I
think
I
hear
the
very
sound
of
it
,
a
certain
lady
have
an
only
daughter
,
a
young
maiden
about
nineteen
year
old
,
and
who
be
possess
of
a
very
considerable
fortune
.
<EOS>
They
be
only
lodger
in
the
house
where
they
be
.
<EOS>
the
young
woman
,
her
mother
,
and
the
maid
have
be
abroad
on
some
occasion
,
I
do
not
remember
what
,
for
the
house
be
not
shut
up
;
but
about
two
hour
after
they
come
home
the
young
lady
complain
she
be
not
well
;
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
she
vomit
and
have
a
violent
pain
in
her
head
.
"
<EOS>
pray
God
"
,
say
her
mother
,
in
a
terrible
fright
,
"
my
child
have
not
the
distemper
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
pain
in
her
head
increase
,
her
mother
order
the
bed
to
be
warm
,
and
resolve
to
put
her
to
bed
,
and
prepare
to
give
her
thing
to
sweat
,
which
be
the
ordinary
remedy
to
be
take
when
the
first
apprehension
of
the
distemper
begin
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
bed
be
air
the
mother
undress
the
young
woman
,
and
just
as
she
be
lay
down
in
the
bed
,
she
,
look
upon
her
body
with
a
candle
,
immediately
discover
the
fatal
token
on
the
inside
of
her
thigh
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
not
be
able
to
contain
herself
,
throw
down
her
candle
and
shriek
out
in
such
a
frightful
manner
that
it
be
enough
to
place
horror
upon
the
stout
heart
in
the
world
;
nor
be
it
one
scream
or
one
cry
,
but
the
fright
have
seize
her
spirit
<EOS>
,
she
 
faint
first
,
then
recover
,
then
run
all
over
the
house
,
up
the
stair
and
down
the
stair
,
like
one
distract
,
and
indeed
really
be
distract
,
and
continue
screech
and
cry
out
for
several
hour
void
of
all
sense
,
or
at
least
government
of
her
sense
,
and
,
as
I
be
tell
,
never
come
thoroughly
to
herself
again
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
young
maiden
,
she
be
a
dead
corpse
from
that
moment
,
for
the
gangrene
which
occasion
the
spot
have
spread
[
over
]
her
whole
body
,
and
she
die
in
less
than
two
hour
.
<EOS>
but
still
the
mother
continue
cry
out
,
not
know
anything
more
of
her
child
,
several
hour
after
she
be
dead
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
long
ago
that
I
be
not
certain
,
but
I
think
the
mother
never
recover
,
but
die
in
two
or
three
week
after
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
an
extraordinary
case
,
and
I
be
therefore
the
more
particular
in
it
,
because
I
come
so
much
to
the
knowledge
of
it
;
but
there
be
innumerable
such
-
like
case
,
and
it
be
seldom
that
the
weekly
bill
come
in
but
there
be
two
or
three
put
in
,
"
fright
"
;
that
is
,
that
may
well
be
call
fright
to
death
.
<EOS>
but
besides
those
who
be
so
fright
as
to
die
upon
the
spot
,
there
be
great
number
fright
to
other
extreme
,
some
fright
out
of
their
sense
,
some
out
of
their
memory
,
and
some
out
of
their
understanding
.
<EOS>
but
I
return
to
the
shutting
up
of
house
.
  
<EOS>
as
several
people
,
I
say
,
get
out
of
their
house
by
stratagem
after
they
be
shut
up
,
so
other
get
out
by
bribe
the
watchman
,
and
give
them
money
to
let
them
go
privately
out
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
<EOS>
I
think
it
at
that
time
the
most
innocent
corruption
or
bribery
that
any
man
could
be
guilty
of
,
and
therefore
could
not
but
pity
the
poor
man
,
and
think
it
be
hard
when
three
of
those
watchman
be
publicly
whip
through
the
street
for
suffer
people
to
go
out
of
house
shut
up
.
  
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
that
severity
,
money
prevail
with
the
poor
man
,
and
many
family
find
mean
to
make
sally
out
,
and
escape
that
way
after
they
have
be
shut
up
;
but
these
be
generally
such
as
have
some
place
to
retire
to
;
and
though
there
be
no
easy
pass
the
road
any
whither
after
the
1st
of
August
,
yet
there
be
many
way
of
retreat
,
and
particularly
,
as
I
hint
,
some
get
tent
and
set
them
up
in
the
field
,
carry
bed
or
straw
to
lie
on
,
and
provision
to
eat
,
and
so
live
in
them
as
hermit
in
a
cell
,
for
nobody
would
venture
to
come
near
them
;
and
several
story
be
tell
of
such
,
some
comical
,
some
tragical
,
some
who
live
like
wander
pilgrim
in
the
desert
,
and
escape
by
make
themselves
exile
in
such
a
manner
as
be
scarce
to
be
credit
,
and
who
yet
enjoy
more
liberty
than
be
to
be
expect
in
such
case
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
by
me
a
story
of
two
brother
and
their
kinsman
,
who
be
single
man
,
but
that
have
stay
in
the
city
too
long
to
get
away
,
and
indeed
not
know
where
to
go
to
have
any
retreat
,
nor
have
wherewith
to
travel
far
,
take
a
course
for
their
own
preservation
,
which
though
in
itself
at
first
desperate
,
yet
be
so
natural
that
it
may
be
wonder
that
no
more
do
so
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
They
be
but
of
mean
condition
,
and
yet
not
so
very
poor
as
that
they
could
not
furnish
themselves
with
<EOS>
some
little
convenience
such
as
may
serve
to
keep
life
and
soul
together
;
and
find
the
distemper
increase
in
a
terrible
manner
,
they
resolve
to
shift
as
well
as
they
could
,
and
to
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
them
have
be
a
soldier
in
the
late
war
,
and
before
that
in
the
Low
Countries
,
and
have
be
breed
to
no
particular
employment
but
his
arm
,
and
besides
be
wound
,
and
not
able
to
work
very
hard
,
have
for
some
time
be
employ
at
a
baker
's
of
sea
-
biscuit
in
Wapping
.
  
<EOS>
the
brother
of
this
man
be
a
seaman
too
,
but
somehow
or
other
have
be
hurt
of
one
leg
,
that
he
could
not
go
to
sea
,
but
have
work
for
his
living
at
a
sailmaker
's
in
wapping
,
or
thereabout
;
and
be
a
good
husband
,
have
lay
up
some
money
,
and
be
the
rich
of
the
three
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
man
be
a
joiner
or
carpenter
by
trade
,
a
handy
fellow
,
and
he
have
no
wealth
but
his
box
or
basket
of
tool
,
with
the
help
of
which
he
could
at
any
time
get
his
living
,
such
a
time
as
this
except
,
wherever
he
go
 
and
he
live
near
Shadwell
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
live
in
Stepney
parish
,
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
the
last
that
be
infect
,
or
at
least
violently
,
they
stay
there
till
they
evidently
see
the
plague
be
abate
at
the
west
part
of
the
town
,
and
come
towards
the
east
,
where
they
live
.
  
<EOS>
the
story
of
those
three
man
,
if
the
reader
will
be
content
to
have
me
give
it
in
their
own
person
,
without
take
upon
me
to
either
vouch
the
particular
or
answer
for
any
mistake
,
I
shall
give
as
distinctly
as
I
can
,
believe
the
history
will
be
a
very
good
pattern
for
any
poor
man
to
follow
,
in
case
the
like
public
desolation
should
happen
here
;
and
if
there
may
be
no
such
occasion
,
which
God
of
His
infinite
mercy
grant
us
,
still
the
story
may
have
its
use
so
many
way
as
that
it
will
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
never
be
say
that
the
relating
have
be
unprofitable
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
all
this
previous
to
the
history
,
have
yet
,
for
the
present
,
much
more
to
say
before
I
quit
my
own
part
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
all
the
first
part
of
the
time
freely
about
the
street
,
though
not
so
freely
as
to
run
myself
into
apparent
danger
,
except
when
they
dig
the
great
pit
in
the
churchyard
of
our
parish
of
Aldgate
.
<EOS>
a
terrible
pit
it
be
,
and
I
could
not
resist
my
curiosity
to
go
and
see
it
.
<EOS>
as
near
as
I
may
judge
,
it
be
about
forty
foot
in
length
,
and
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
foot
broad
,
and
at
the
time
I
first
look
at
it
,
about
nine
foot
deep
;
but
it
be
say
they
dig
it
near
twenty
foot
deep
afterwards
in
one
part
of
it
,
till
they
could
go
no
deep
for
the
water
;
for
they
have
,
it
seem
,
dig
several
large
pit
before
this
.
<EOS>
for
though
the
plague
be
long
a
-
come
to
our
parish
,
yet
,
when
it
do
come
,
there
be
no
parish
in
or
about
London
where
it
rage
with
such
violence
as
in
the
two
parish
of
Aldgate
and
Whitechappel
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
they
have
dig
several
pit
in
another
ground
,
when
the
distemper
begin
to
spread
in
our
parish
,
and
especially
when
the
dead
-
cart
begin
to
go
about
,
which
be
not
,
in
our
parish
,
till
the
beginning
of
August
.
<EOS>
into
these
pit
they
have
put
perhaps
fifty
or
sixty
body
each
;
then
they
make
large
hole
wherein
they
bury
all
that
the
cart
bring
in
a
week
,
which
,
by
the
middle
to
the
end
of
August
,
come
to
from
200
to
400
a
week
;
and
they
could
not
well
dig
them
larger
,
because
of
the
order
of
the
magistrate
confine
them
to
leave
no
body
within
six
foot
of
the
surface
;
and
the
water
come
on
at
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
foot
,
they
could
not
well
,
I
say
,
put
more
in
one
pit
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
at
the
beginning
of
September
,
the
plague
rage
in
a
dreadful
manner
,
and
the
number
of
burial
in
our
parish
increase
to
more
than
be
ever
bury
in
any
parish
about
London
of
no
large
extent
,
they
order
this
dreadful
gulf
to
be
dig
 
for
such
it
be
,
rather
than
a
pit
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
suppose
this
pit
would
have
supply
them
for
a
month
or
more
when
they
dig
it
,
and
some
blame
the
churchwarden
for
suffer
such
a
frightful
thing
,
tell
them
they
be
make
preparation
to
bury
the
whole
parish
,
and
the
like
;
but
time
make
it
appear
the
churchwarden
know
the
condition
of
the
parish
better
than
they
do
:
for
,
the
pit
be
finish
the
4th
of
September
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
they
begin
to
bury
in
it
the
6th
,
and
by
the
20th
,
which
be
just
two
week
,
they
have
throw
into
it
1114
body
when
they
be
oblige
to
fill
it
up
,
the
body
be
then
come
to
lie
within
six
foot
of
the
surface
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
there
may
be
some
ancient
person
alive
in
the
parish
who
can
justify
the
fact
of
this
,
and
be
able
to
show
even
in
what
place
of
the
churchyard
the
pit
lie
better
than
I
can
.
<EOS>
the
mark
of
it
also
be
many
year
to
be
see
in
the
churchyard
on
the
surface
,
lie
in
length
parallel
with
the
passage
which
go
by
the
west
wall
of
the
churchyard
out
of
Houndsditch
,
and
turn
east
again
into
Whitechappel
,
come
out
near
the
Three
Nuns
'
Inn
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
10th
of
September
that
my
curiosity
lead
,
or
rather
drive
,
me
to
go
and
see
this
pit
again
,
when
there
have
be
near
400
people
bury
in
it
;
and
I
be
not
content
to
see
it
in
the
day
-
time
,
as
I
have
do
before
,
<EOS>
for
then
there
would
have
be
nothing
to
have
be
see
but
the
loose
earth
;
for
all
the
body
that
be
throw
in
be
immediately
cover
with
earth
by
those
they
call
the
burier
,
which
at
other
time
be
call
bearer
;
but
I
resolve
to
go
in
the
night
and
see
some
of
them
throw
in
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
strict
order
to
prevent
people
come
to
those
pit
,
and
that
be
only
to
prevent
infection
.
<EOS>
but
after
some
time
that
order
be
more
necessary
,
for
people
that
be
infect
and
near
their
end
,
and
delirious
also
,
would
run
to
those
pit
,
wrapt
in
blanket
or
rug
,
and
throw
themselves
in
,
and
,
as
they
say
,
bury
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
the
officer
suffer
any
willingly
to
lie
there
;
but
I
have
hear
that
in
a
great
pit
in
Finsbury
,
in
the
parish
of
Cripplegate
,
it
lie
open
then
to
the
field
,
for
it
be
not
then
wall
about
,
[
many
]
come
and
throw
themselves
in
,
and
expire
there
,
before
they
throw
any
earth
upon
them
;
and
that
when
they
come
to
bury
other
and
find
them
there
,
they
be
quite
dead
,
though
not
cold
.
  
<EOS>
this
may
serve
a
little
to
describe
the
dreadful
condition
of
that
day
,
though
it
be
impossible
to
say
anything
that
be
able
to
give
a
true
idea
of
it
to
those
who
do
not
see
it
,
other
than
this
,
that
it
be
indeed
very
,
very
,
very
dreadful
,
and
such
as
no
tongue
can
express
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
admittance
into
the
churchyard
by
be
acquaint
with
the
sexton
who
attend
;
who
,
though
he
do
not
refuse
me
at
all
,
yet
earnestly
persuade
me
not
to
go
,
tell
me
very
seriously
(
for
he
be
a
good
,
religious
,
and
sensible
man
)
<EOS>
that
it
be
indeed
their
business
and
duty
to
venture
,
and
to
run
all
hazard
,
and
that
in
it
they
may
hope
to
be
preserve
;
but
that
I
have
no
apparent
call
to
it
but
my
own
curiosity
,
which
,
he
say
,
he
believe
I
would
not
pretend
be
sufficient
to
justify
my
running
that
hazard
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
have
be
press
in
my
mind
to
go
,
and
that
perhaps
it
may
be
an
instruct
sight
,
that
may
not
be
without
its
use
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
"
say
the
good
man
,
"
if
you
will
venture
upon
that
score
,
name
of
God
go
in
;
for
,
depend
upon
it
,
'
twill
be
a
sermon
to
you
,
it
may
be
,
the
good
that
ever
you
hear
in
your
life
.
'
<EOS>
tis
a
speak
sight
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
have
a
voice
with
it
,
and
a
loud
one
,
to
call
us
all
to
repentance
"
;
and
with
that
he
open
the
door
and
say
,
"
go
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
discourse
have
shock
my
resolution
a
little
,
and
I
stand
waver
for
a
good
while
,
but
just
at
that
interval
<EOS>
I
see
two
link
come
over
from
the
end
of
the
Minories
,
and
hear
the
bellman
,
and
then
appear
a
dead
-
cart
,
as
they
call
it
,
come
over
the
street
;
so
I
could
no
longer
resist
my
desire
of
see
it
,
and
go
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
,
as
I
could
perceive
at
first
,
in
the
churchyard
,
or
go
into
it
,
but
the
burier
and
the
fellow
that
drive
the
cart
,
or
rather
lead
the
horse
and
cart
;
but
when
they
come
up
to
the
pit
they
see
a
man
go
to
and
again
,
muffle
up
in
a
brown
Cloak
,
and
make
motion
with
his
hand
under
his
cloak
,
as
if
he
be
in
great
agony
,
and
the
burier
immediately
gather
about
him
,
suppose
he
be
one
of
those
poor
delirious
or
desperate
creature
that
use
to
pretend
,
as
I
have
say
,
to
bury
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
as
he
walk
about
,
but
two
or
three
time
groan
very
deeply
and
loud
,
and
sigh
as
he
would
break
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
burier
come
up
to
him
they
soon
find
he
be
neither
a
person
infect
and
desperate
,
as
I
have
observe
above
,
or
a
person
distemper
 
in
mind
,
but
one
oppress
with
a
dreadful
weight
of
grief
indeed
,
have
his
wife
and
several
of
his
child
all
in
the
cart
that
be
just
come
in
with
him
,
and
he
follow
in
an
agony
and
excess
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
He
mourn
heartily
,
as
it
be
easy
to
see
,
but
with
a
kind
of
masculine
grief
that
could
not
give
itself
vent
by
tear
;
and
calmly
defy
the
burier
to
let
him
alone
,
say
he
would
only
see
the
body
throw
in
and
go
away
,
<EOS>
so
they
leave
importune
him
.
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
be
the
cart
turn
round
and
the
body
shoot
into
the
pit
promiscuously
,
which
be
a
surprise
to
him
,
for
he
at
least
expect
they
would
have
be
decently
lay
in
,
though
indeed
he
be
afterwards
convinced
that
be
impracticable
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
no
sooner
do
he
see
the
sight
but
he
cry
out
aloud
,
unable
to
contain
himself
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
hear
what
he
say
,
but
he
go
backward
two
or
three
step
and
fall
down
in
a
swoon
.
<EOS>
the
burier
run
to
him
and
take
him
up
,
and
in
a
little
while
he
come
to
himself
,
and
they
lead
him
away
to
the
Pie
Tavern
over
against
the
end
of
Houndsditch
,
where
,
it
seem
,
the
man
be
know
,
and
where
they
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
look
into
the
pit
again
as
he
go
away
,
but
the
burier
have
cover
the
body
so
immediately
with
throw
in
earth
,
that
though
there
be
light
enough
,
for
there
be
lantern
,
and
candle
in
them
,
place
all
night
round
the
side
of
the
pit
,
upon
heap
of
earth
,
seven
or
eight
,
or
perhaps
more
,
yet
nothing
could
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
mournful
scene
indeed
,
and
affect
me
almost
as
much
as
the
rest
;
but
the
other
be
awful
and
full
of
terror
.
<EOS>
the
cart
have
in
it
sixteen
or
seventeen
body
;
some
be
wrapt
up
in
linen
sheet
,
some
in
rag
,
some
little
other
than
naked
,
or
so
loose
that
what
cover
they
have
fall
from
them
in
the
shooting
out
of
the
cart
,
and
they
fall
quite
naked
among
the
rest
;
but
the
matter
be
not
much
to
them
,
or
the
indecency
much
to
any
one
else
,
see
they
be
all
dead
,
and
be
to
be
huddle
together
into
the
common
grave
of
mankind
,
as
we
may
call
it
,
for
here
<EOS>
be
no
difference
make
,
but
poor
and
rich
go
together
;
there
be
no
other
way
of
burial
,
neither
be
it
possible
there
<EOS>
should
,
for
coffin
be
not
to
be
have
for
the
prodigious
number
that
fall
in
such
a
calamity
as
this
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
report
by
way
of
scandal
upon
the
burier
,
that
if
any
corpse
be
deliver
to
them
decently
wind
up
,
as
we
call
it
then
,
in
a
winding
-
sheet
tie
over
the
head
and
foot
,
which
some
do
,
and
which
be
generally
of
good
linen
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
it
be
report
that
the
burier
be
so
wicked
as
to
strip
them
in
the
cart
and
carry
them
quite
naked
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
can
not
easily
credit
anything
so
vile
among
Christians
,
and
at
a
time
so
fill
with
terror
as
that
be
,
I
can
only
relate
it
and
leave
it
undetermined
.
  
<EOS>
innumerable
story
also
go
about
of
the
cruel
behaviour
and
practice
of
nurse
who
tend
the
sick
,
and
of
their
hastening
on
the
fate
of
those
they
tend
in
their
sickness
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
say
more
of
this
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
shock
with
this
sight
;
it
almost
overwhelm
me
,
and
I
go
away
with
my
heart
most
afflict
,
and
full
of
the
afflict
thought
,
such
as
I
can
not
describe
just
at
my
go
out
of
the
church
,
and
turn
up
the
street
towards
my
own
house
,
I
see
another
cart
with
link
,
and
a
bellman
go
before
,
come
out
of
Harrow
Alley
in
the
Butcher
Row
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
,
and
be
,
as
I
perceive
,
very
full
of
dead
body
,
it
go
directly
over
the
street
also
toward
the
church
.
<EOS>
I
stand
a
while
,
but
I
have
no
stomach
to
go
back
again
to
see
the
same
dismal
scene
over
again
,
so
<EOS>
I
go
directly
home
,
where
I
could
not
but
consider
with
thankfulness
the
risk
I
have
run
,
believe
I
have
get
no
injury
,
as
indeed
I
have
not
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
poor
unhappy
gentleman
's
grief
come
into
my
head
again
,
and
indeed
I
could
not
but
shed
tear
in
the
reflection
upon
it
,
perhaps
more
than
he
do
himself
;
but
his
case
lie
so
heavy
upon
my
mind
that
I
could
not
prevail
with
myself
,
but
that
I
must
go
out
again
into
the
street
,
and
go
to
the
Pie
Tavern
,
resolve
to
inquire
what
become
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
by
this
time
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
yet
the
poor
gentleman
be
there
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
the
people
of
the
house
,
know
him
,
have
entertain
him
,
and
keep
him
there
all
the
night
,
notwithstanding
the
danger
of
be
infect
by
him
,
though
it
appear
the
man
be
perfectly
sound
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
regret
that
I
take
notice
of
this
tavern
.
<EOS>
the
people
be
civil
,
mannerly
,
and
an
obliging
sort
of
folk
enough
,
and
have
till
this
time
keep
their
house
open
and
their
trade
go
on
,
though
not
so
very
publicly
as
formerly
:
but
there
be
a
dreadful
set
of
fellow
that
use
their
house
,
and
who
,
in
the
middle
of
all
this
horror
,
meet
there
every
night
,
behave
with
all
the
revelling
and
roar
extravagance
as
be
usual
for
such
people
to
do
at
other
time
,
and
,
indeed
,
to
such
an
offensive
degree
that
the
very
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
grow
first
ashamed
and
then
terrify
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
sit
generally
in
a
room
next
the
street
,
and
as
they
always
keep
late
hour
,
so
when
the
dead
-
cart
come
across
the
street
-
end
to
go
into
Houndsditch
,
which
be
in
view
of
the
tavern
window
,
they
would
frequently
open
the
window
as
soon
as
they
hear
the
bell
and
look
out
at
them
;
and
as
they
may
often
hear
sad
lamentation
of
people
in
the
street
or
at
their
window
as
the
cart
go
along
,
they
would
make
their
impudent
mock
and
jeer
at
them
,
especially
if
they
hear
the
poor
people
call
upon
God
to
have
mercy
upon
them
,
as
many
would
do
at
those
time
in
their
ordinary
passing
along
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
these
gentleman
,
be
something
disturb
with
the
clutter
of
bring
the
poor
gentleman
into
the
house
,
as
above
,
be
first
angry
and
very
high
with
the
master
of
the
house
for
suffer
such
a
fellow
,
as
they
call
him
,
to
be
bring
out
of
the
grave
into
their
house
;
but
be
answer
that
the
man
be
a
neighbour
,
and
that
he
be
sound
,
but
overwhelm
with
the
calamity
of
his
family
,
and
the
like
,
they
turn
their
anger
into
ridicule
the
man
and
his
sorrow
for
his
wife
and
child
,
taunt
him
with
want
of
courage
to
leap
into
the
great
pit
and
go
to
heaven
,
as
they
jeeringly
express
it
,
along
with
them
,
add
some
very
profane
and
even
blasphemous
expression
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
at
this
vile
work
when
I
come
back
to
the
house
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
though
the
man
sit
still
,
mute
and
disconsolate
,
and
their
affront
could
not
divert
his
sorrow
,
yet
he
be
both
grieve
and
offend
at
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
upon
this
I
gently
reprove
them
,
be
well
enough
acquaint
with
their
character
,
and
not
unknown
in
person
to
two
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
immediately
fall
upon
me
with
ill
language
and
oath
,
ask
me
what
I
do
out
of
my
grave
at
such
a
time
when
so
many
honester
man
be
carry
into
the
churchyard
,
and
why
I
be
not
at
home
say
my
prayer
against
the
dead
-
cart
come
for
me
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
astonish
at
the
impudence
of
the
man
,
though
not
at
all
discompose
at
their
treatment
of
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
keep
my
temper
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
that
though
I
defy
them
or
any
man
in
the
world
to
tax
me
with
any
dishonesty
,
yet
I
acknowledge
that
in
this
terrible
judgement
of
God
many
better
than
I
be
sweep
away
and
carry
to
their
grave
.
<EOS>
but
to
answer
their
question
directly
,
the
case
be
,
that
I
be
mercifully
preserve
by
that
great
God
whose
name
they
have
blaspheme
and
take
in
vain
by
curse
and
swear
in
a
dreadful
manner
,
and
that
I
believe
I
be
preserve
in
particular
,
among
other
end
of
His
goodness
,
that
I
may
reprove
them
for
their
audacious
boldness
in
behave
in
such
a
manner
and
in
such
an
awful
time
as
this
be
,
especially
for
their
jeering
and
mock
at
an
honest
gentleman
and
a
neighbour
(
for
some
of
them
know
him
)
,
who
,
they
see
,
be
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
for
the
breach
which
it
have
please
God
to
make
upon
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
exactly
to
mind
the
hellish
,
abominable
raillery
which
be
the
return
they
make
to
that
talk
of
mine
:
be
provoke
,
it
seem
,
that
I
be
not
at
all
afraid
to
be
free
with
them
;
nor
,
if
I
could
remember
,
would
I
fill
my
account
with
any
of
the
word
,
the
horrid
oath
,
curse
,
and
vile
expression
,
such
as
,
at
that
time
of
the
day
,
even
the
bad
and
ordinari
people
in
the
street
would
not
use
;
for
,
except
such
hardened
creature
as
these
,
the
most
wicked
wretch
that
could
be
find
<EOS>
have
at
that
time
some
terror
upon
their
mind
of
the
hand
of
that
power
which
could
thus
in
a
moment
destroy
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
which
be
the
bad
in
all
their
devilish
language
be
,
that
they
be
not
afraid
to
blaspheme
God
and
talk
atheistically
,
make
a
jest
of
my
call
the
plague
the
hand
of
God
;
mock
,
and
even
laugh
,
at
the
word
judgement
,
as
if
the
providence
of
God
have
no
concern
in
the
inflicting
such
a
desolating
stroke
;
and
that
the
people
call
upon
God
as
they
see
the
cart
carry
away
the
dead
body
be
all
enthusiastic
,
absurd
,
and
impertinent
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
them
some
reply
,
such
as
I
think
proper
,
but
<EOS>
which
I
find
be
so
far
from
put
a
check
to
their
horrid
way
of
speak
that
it
make
them
rail
the
more
,
so
that
I
confess
it
fill
me
with
horror
and
a
kind
of
rage
,
and
I
come
away
,
as
I
tell
them
,
lest
the
hand
of
that
judgement
which
have
visit
the
whole
city
should
glorify
His
vengeance
upon
them
,
and
all
that
be
near
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
receive
all
reproof
with
the
utmost
contempt
,
and
make
the
great
mockery
that
be
possible
for
them
to
do
at
me
,
give
me
all
the
opprobrious
,
insolent
scoff
that
they
could
think
of
for
preach
to
them
,
as
they
call
it
,
which
indeed
grieve
me
,
rather
than
anger
me
;
and
I
go
away
,
bless
God
<EOS>
,
however
,
in
my
mind
that
I
have
not
spare
them
,
though
they
have
insult
me
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
They
continue
this
wretched
course
three
or
four
day
after
this
,
continually
mock
and
jeer
at
all
that
show
themselves
religious
or
serious
,
or
that
be
any
way
touch
with
the
sense
of
the
terrible
judgement
of
God
upon
us
;
and
I
be
inform
they
flout
in
the
same
manner
at
the
good
people
who
,
notwithstanding
the
contagion
,
meet
at
the
church
,
fast
,
and
pray
to
God
to
remove
His
hand
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
they
continue
this
dreadful
course
three
or
four
day
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
no
more
 
when
one
of
them
,
particularly
he
who
ask
the
poor
gentleman
what
he
do
out
of
his
grave
,
be
strike
from
Heaven
with
the
plague
,
and
die
in
a
most
deplorable
manner
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
they
be
every
one
of
them
carry
into
the
great
pit
which
I
have
mention
above
,
before
it
be
quite
fill
up
,
which
be
not
above
a
fortnight
or
thereabout
.
  
<EOS>
these
man
be
guilty
of
many
extravagance
,
such
as
one
would
think
human
nature
should
have
tremble
at
the
thought
of
at
such
a
time
of
general
terror
as
be
then
upon
us
,
and
particularly
scoff
and
mock
at
everything
which
they
happen
to
see
that
be
religious
among
the
people
,
especially
at
their
throng
zealously
to
the
place
of
public
worship
to
implore
mercy
from
Heaven
in
such
a
time
of
distress
;
and
this
tavern
where
they
hold
their
dub
be
within
view
of
the
church
-
door
,
they
have
the
more
particular
occasion
for
their
atheistical
profane
mirth
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
begin
to
abate
a
little
with
them
before
the
accident
which
I
have
relate
happen
,
for
the
infection
increase
so
violently
at
this
part
of
the
town
now
,
that
people
begin
to
be
afraid
to
come
to
the
church
;
at
least
such
number
do
not
resort
thither
as
be
usual
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
clergyman
likewise
be
dead
,
and
other
go
into
the
country
;
for
it
really
require
a
steady
courage
and
a
strong
faith
for
a
man
not
only
to
venture
be
in
town
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
but
likewise
to
venture
to
come
to
church
and
perform
the
office
of
a
minister
to
a
congregation
,
of
whom
he
have
reason
to
believe
many
of
them
be
actually
infect
with
the
plague
,
and
to
do
this
every
day
,
or
twice
a
day
,
as
in
some
place
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
the
people
show
an
extraordinary
zeal
in
these
religious
exercise
,
and
as
the
church
-
door
be
always
open
,
people
would
go
in
single
at
all
time
,
whether
the
minister
be
officiate
or
no
,
and
lock
themselves
into
separate
pew
,
would
be
pray
to
God
with
great
fervency
and
devotion
.
  
<EOS>
other
assemble
at
meeting
-
house
,
every
one
as
their
different
opinion
in
such
thing
guide
,
but
all
be
promiscuously
the
subject
of
these
man
's
drollery
,
especially
at
the
beginning
of
the
visitation
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
they
have
be
check
for
their
open
insulting
religion
in
this
manner
by
several
good
people
of
every
persuasion
,
and
that
,
and
the
violent
raging
of
the
infection
,
I
suppose
,
be
the
occasion
that
they
have
abate
much
of
their
rudeness
for
some
time
before
,
and
be
only
rouse
by
the
spirit
of
ribaldry
and
atheism
at
the
clamour
which
be
make
when
the
gentleman
be
first
bring
in
there
,
and
perhaps
be
agitate
by
the
same
devil
,
when
I
take
upon
me
to
reprove
them
;
though
I
do
it
at
first
with
all
the
calmness
,
temper
,
and
good
manner
that
I
could
,
which
for
a
while
they
insult
me
the
more
for
think
it
have
be
in
fear
of
their
resentment
,
though
afterwards
they
find
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
home
,
indeed
,
grieve
and
afflict
in
my
mind
at
the
abominable
wickedness
of
those
man
,
not
doubt
,
however
,
that
they
would
be
make
dreadful
example
of
God
's
justice
;
for
I
look
upon
this
dismal
time
to
be
a
particular
season
of
Divine
vengeance
,
and
that
God
would
on
this
occasion
single
out
the
proper
object
of
His
displeasure
in
a
more
especial
and
remarkable
manner
than
at
another
time
;
and
that
though
I
do
believe
that
many
good
people
would
,
and
do
,
fall
in
the
common
calamity
,
and
that
it
be
no
certain
rule
to
judge
of
the
eternal
state
of
any
one
by
their
be
distinguish
in
such
a
time
of
general
destruction
neither
one
way
or
other
;
yet
,
I
say
,
it
could
not
but
seem
reasonable
to
believe
that
God
would
not
think
fit
to
spare
by
His
mercy
such
open
declare
enemy
,
that
should
insult
His
name
and
being
,
defy
His
vengeance
,
and
mock
at
His
worship
and
worshipper
at
such
a
time
;
no
,
not
though
His
mercy
have
think
fit
to
bear
with
and
spare
them
at
other
time
;
that
this
be
a
day
of
visitation
,
a
day
of
God
's
anger
,
and
those
word
come
into
my
thought
,
Jer
.
<EOS>
v.
9
:
"
Shall
I
not
visit
for
these
thing
?
<EOS>
saith
the
Lord
:
and
shall
not
My
soul
be
avenge
of
such
a
nation
as
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
these
thing
,
I
say
,
lie
upon
my
mind
,
and
I
go
home
very
much
grieve
and
oppress
with
the
horror
of
these
man
's
wickedness
,
and
to
think
that
anything
could
be
so
vile
,
so
hardened
,
and
notoriously
wicked
as
to
insult
God
,
and
His
servant
,
and
His
worship
in
such
a
manner
,
and
at
such
a
time
as
this
be
,
when
He
have
,
as
it
be
,
His
sword
draw
in
His
hand
on
purpose
to
take
vengeance
not
on
them
only
,
but
on
the
whole
nation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
indeed
,
be
in
some
passion
at
first
with
them
 
though
it
be
really
raise
,
not
by
any
affront
they
have
offer
me
personally
,
but
by
the
horror
their
blaspheming
tongue
fill
me
with
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
doubtful
in
my
thought
whether
the
resentment
I
retain
be
not
all
upon
my
own
private
account
,
for
they
have
give
me
a
great
deal
of
ill
language
<EOS>
too
 
<EOS>
I
mean
personally
;
<EOS>
but
after
some
pause
,
and
have
a
weight
of
grief
upon
my
mind
,
I
retire
myself
as
soon
as
I
come
home
,
for
I
sleep
not
that
night
;
and
give
God
most
humble
thank
for
my
preservation
in
the
eminent
danger
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
<EOS>
,
I
set
my
mind
seriously
and
with
the
utmost
earnestness
to
pray
for
those
desperate
wretch
,
that
God
would
pardon
them
,
open
their
eye
,
and
effectually
humble
them
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
I
not
only
do
my
duty
,
namely
,
to
pray
for
those
who
despitefully
use
me
,
but
I
fully
try
my
own
heart
,
to
my
fun
satisfaction
,
that
it
be
not
fill
with
any
spirit
of
resentment
as
they
have
offend
me
in
particular
;
and
I
humbly
recommend
the
method
to
all
those
that
would
know
,
or
be
certain
,
how
to
distinguish
between
their
zeal
for
the
honour
of
God
and
the
effect
of
their
private
passion
and
resentment
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
back
here
to
the
particular
incident
which
occur
to
my
thought
of
the
time
of
the
visitation
,
and
particularly
to
the
time
of
their
shut
up
house
in
the
first
part
of
their
sickness
;
for
before
the
sickness
be
come
to
its
height
people
have
more
room
to
make
their
observation
than
they
have
afterward
;
but
when
it
be
in
the
extremity
there
be
no
such
thing
as
communication
with
one
another
,
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
shutting
up
of
house
,
as
I
have
say
,
some
violence
be
offer
to
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
as
to
soldier
,
there
be
none
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
the
few
guard
which
the
king
then
have
,
which
be
nothing
like
the
number
entertain
since
,
be
disperse
,
either
at
Oxford
with
the
Court
,
or
in
quarter
in
the
remoter
part
of
the
country
,
small
detachment
except
,
who
do
duty
at
the
Tower
and
at
Whitehall
,
and
these
but
very
few
.
<EOS>
neither
be
I
positive
that
there
be
any
other
guard
at
the
Tower
than
the
warder
,
as
they
call
them
,
who
stand
at
the
gate
with
gown
and
cap
,
the
same
as
the
yeoman
of
the
guard
,
except
the
ordinary
gunner
,
who
be
twenty
-
four
,
and
the
officer
appoint
to
look
after
the
magazine
,
who
be
call
armourer
.
<EOS>
as
to
train
band
,
there
be
no
possibility
of
raise
any
;
neither
,
if
the
Lieutenancy
,
either
of
London
or
Middlesex
,
have
order
the
drum
to
beat
for
the
militia
,
would
any
of
the
company
,
I
believe
,
have
draw
together
,
whatever
risk
they
have
run
.
  
<EOS>
this
make
the
watchman
be
the
less
regarded
,
and
perhaps
occasion
the
great
violence
to
be
use
against
them
.
<EOS>
I
mention
it
on
this
score
to
observe
that
the
set
watchman
thus
to
keep
the
people
in
be
,
first
of
all
,
not
effectual
,
but
that
the
people
break
out
,
whether
by
force
or
by
stratagem
,
even
almost
as
often
as
they
please
;
and
,
second
,
that
those
that
do
thus
break
out
be
generally
people
infect
who
,
in
their
desperation
,
run
about
from
one
place
to
another
,
value
not
whom
they
injure
:
and
which
perhaps
,
as
I
have
say
,
may
give
birth
to
report
that
it
be
natural
to
the
infected
people
to
desire
to
infect
other
,
which
report
be
really
false
.
  
<EOS>
and
I
know
it
so
well
,
and
in
so
many
several
case
,
that
I
could
give
several
relation
of
good
,
pious
,
and
religious
people
who
,
when
they
have
have
the
distemper
,
have
be
so
far
from
be
forward
to
infect
other
that
they
have
forbid
their
own
family
to
come
near
them
,
in
hope
of
their
be
preserve
,
and
have
even
die
without
see
their
near
relation
lest
they
should
be
instrumental
to
give
them
the
distemper
,
and
infect
or
endanger
them
.
<EOS>
if
,
then
,
there
be
case
wherein
the
infected
people
be
careless
of
the
injury
they
do
to
other
,
this
be
certainly
one
of
them
,
if
not
the
chief
,
namely
,
when
people
who
have
the
distemper
have
break
out
from
house
which
be
so
shut
up
,
and
have
be
drive
to
extremity
for
provision
or
for
entertainment
,
have
endeavour
to
conceal
their
condition
,
and
have
be
thereby
instrumental
involuntarily
to
infect
other
who
have
be
ignorant
and
unwary
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
reason
why
I
believe
then
,
and
do
believe
still
,
that
the
shut
up
house
thus
by
force
,
and
restrain
,
or
rather
imprison
,
people
in
their
own
house
,
as
I
say
above
,
be
of
little
or
no
service
in
the
whole
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
be
of
opinion
it
be
rather
hurtful
,
have
force
those
desperate
people
to
wander
abroad
with
the
plague
upon
them
,
who
would
otherwise
have
die
quietly
in
their
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
one
citizen
who
,
have
thus
break
out
of
his
house
in
Aldersgate
Street
or
thereabout
,
go
along
the
road
to
Islington
;
he
attempt
to
have
go
in
at
the
Angel
Inn
,
and
after
that
the
White
Horse
,
two
inn
know
still
by
the
same
sign
,
but
be
refuse
;
after
which
he
come
to
the
Pied
Bull
,
an
inn
also
still
continue
the
same
sign
.
<EOS>
He
ask
them
for
lodge
for
one
night
only
,
pretend
to
be
go
into
Lincolnshire
,
and
assure
them
of
his
be
very
sound
and
free
from
the
infection
,
which
also
at
that
time
have
not
reach
much
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
They
tell
him
they
have
no
lodging
that
they
could
spare
but
one
bed
up
in
the
garret
,
and
that
they
could
spare
that
bed
for
one
night
,
some
drover
be
expect
the
next
day
with
cattle
;
so
,
if
he
would
accept
of
that
lodging
,
he
may
have
it
,
which
he
do
.
<EOS>
so
a
servant
be
send
up
with
a
candle
with
him
to
show
him
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
well
dressed
,
and
look
like
a
person
not
use
to
lie
in
a
garret
;
and
when
he
come
to
the
room
he
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
say
to
the
servant
,
"
I
have
seldom
lie
in
such
a
lodging
as
this
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
the
servant
assure
him
again
that
they
have
no
well
,
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
must
make
shift
;
this
be
a
dreadful
time
;
but
it
be
<EOS>
but
for
one
night
.
<EOS>
"
so
he
sit
down
upon
the
bedside
,
and
bade
the
maid
,
I
think
it
be
,
fetch
him
up
a
pint
of
warm
ale
.
<EOS>
accordingly
the
servant
go
for
the
ale
,
but
some
hurry
in
the
house
,
which
perhaps
employ
her
other
way
,
put
it
out
of
her
head
,
and
she
go
up
no
more
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
see
no
appearance
of
the
gentleman
,
somebody
in
the
house
ask
the
servant
that
have
show
him
upstairs
what
be
become
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
start
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
alas
I
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
never
think
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
bid
me
carry
him
some
warm
ale
,
but
I
forget
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
upon
which
,
not
the
maid
,
but
some
other
person
be
send
up
to
see
after
him
,
who
,
come
into
the
room
,
find
him
stark
dead
and
almost
cold
,
stretch
out
across
the
bed
.
<EOS>
His
clothe
be
pull
off
,
his
jaw
fall
,
his
eye
open
in
a
most
frightful
posture
,
the
rug
of
the
bed
be
grasp
hard
in
one
of
his
hand
,
so
that
it
be
plain
<EOS>
he
die
soon
after
the
maid
leave
him
;
and
'
tis
probable
,
have
she
go
up
with
the
ale
,
she
have
find
him
dead
in
a
few
minute
after
he
sit
down
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
the
alarm
be
great
in
the
house
,
as
anyone
may
suppose
,
they
have
be
free
from
the
distemper
till
that
disaster
,
which
,
bring
the
infection
to
the
house
,
spread
it
immediately
to
other
house
round
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
how
many
die
in
the
house
itself
,
but
I
think
the
maid
-
servant
who
go
up
first
with
him
fall
presently
ill
by
the
fright
,
and
several
other
;
for
,
whereas
there
die
but
two
in
Islington
of
the
plague
the
week
before
,
there
die
seventeen
the
week
after
,
whereof
fourteen
be
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
this
be
in
the
week
from
the
11th
of
July
to
the
18th
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
shift
that
some
family
have
,
and
that
not
a
few
,
when
their
house
happen
to
be
infect
,
and
that
be
this
:
<EOS>
the
family
who
,
in
the
first
breaking
-
out
of
the
distemper
,
flee
away
into
the
country
and
have
retreat
among
their
friend
,
generally
find
some
or
other
of
their
neighbour
or
relation
to
commit
the
charge
of
those
house
to
for
the
safety
of
the
good
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
some
house
be
,
indeed
,
entirely
lock
up
,
the
door
padlock
,
the
window
and
door
have
deal
board
nail
over
them
,
and
only
the
inspection
of
them
commit
to
the
ordinary
watchman
and
parish
officer
;
but
these
be
but
few
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
think
that
there
be
not
less
than
10,000
house
forsake
of
the
inhabitant
in
the
city
and
suburb
,
include
what
be
in
the
out
-
parish
and
in
Surrey
,
or
the
side
of
the
water
they
call
Southwark
.
<EOS>
this
be
besides
the
number
of
lodger
,
and
of
particular
person
who
be
flee
out
of
other
family
;
so
that
in
all
it
be
compute
that
about
200,000
people
be
flee
and
go
.
<EOS>
but
of
this
I
shall
speak
again
.
<EOS>
but
I
mention
it
here
on
this
account
,
namely
,
that
it
be
a
rule
with
those
who
have
thus
two
house
in
their
keeping
or
care
,
that
if
anybody
be
take
sick
in
a
family
,
before
the
master
of
the
family
let
the
examiner
or
any
other
officer
know
of
it
,
he
immediately
would
send
all
the
rest
of
his
family
,
whether
child
or
servant
,
as
it
fall
out
to
be
,
to
such
other
house
which
he
have
so
in
charge
,
and
then
give
notice
of
the
sick
person
to
the
examiner
,
have
a
nurse
or
nurse
appoint
,
and
have
another
person
to
be
shut
up
in
the
house
with
them
(
which
many
for
money
would
do
)
,
so
to
take
charge
of
the
house
in
case
the
person
should
die
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
,
in
many
case
,
the
save
a
whole
family
,
who
,
if
they
have
be
shut
up
with
the
sick
person
,
would
inevitably
have
perish
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
this
be
another
of
the
inconvenience
of
shut
up
house
;
for
the
apprehension
and
terror
of
be
shut
up
make
many
run
away
with
the
rest
of
the
family
,
who
,
though
it
be
not
publicly
know
,
and
they
be
not
quite
sick
,
have
yet
the
distemper
upon
them
;
and
who
,
by
have
an
uninterrupted
liberty
to
go
about
,
but
be
oblige
still
to
conceal
their
circumstance
,
or
perhaps
not
know
it
themselves
,
give
the
distemper
to
other
,
and
spread
the
infection
in
a
dreadful
manner
,
as
I
shall
explain
further
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
may
be
able
to
make
an
observation
or
two
of
my
own
,
which
may
be
of
use
hereafter
to
those
into
whose
band
these
may
come
,
if
they
should
ever
see
the
like
dreadful
visitation
.
<EOS>
(

)
<EOS>
the
infection
generally
come
into
the
house
of
the
citizen
by
the
mean
of
their
servant
,
whom
they
be
oblige
to
send
up
and
down
the
street
for
necessary
;
that
be
to
say
,
for
food
or
physic
,
to
bakehouse
,
brew
-
house
,
shop
,
&
c.
;
and
who
go
necessarily
through
the
street
into
shop
,
market
,
and
the
like
,
it
be
impossible
but
that
they
should
,
one
way
or
other
,
meet
with
distemper
people
,
who
convey
the
fatal
breath
into
them
,
and
they
bring
it
home
to
the
family
to
which
they
belong
.
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
It
be
a
great
mistake
that
such
a
great
city
as
this
have
but
one
pest
-
house
;
for
have
there
be
,
instead
of
one
pest
-
house
 
viz
.
<EOS>
,
beyond
Bunhill
Fields
,
where
,
at
most
,
they
could
receive
,
perhaps
,
two
hundred
or
three
hundred
people
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
have
there
,
instead
of
that
one
,
be
several
pest
-
house
,
every
one
able
to
contain
a
thousand
people
,
without
lie
two
in
a
bed
,
or
two
bed
in
a
room
;
and
have
every
master
of
a
family
,
as
soon
as
any
servant
especially
have
be
take
sick
in
his
house
,
be
oblige
to
send
them
to
the
next
pest
-
house
,
if
they
be
willing
,
as
many
be
,
and
have
the
examiner
do
the
like
among
the
poor
people
when
any
have
be
stricken
with
the
infection
;
I
say
,
have
this
be
do
where
the
people
be
willing
(
not
otherwise
)
,
and
the
house
not
be
shut
,
I
be
persuade
,
and
be
all
the
while
of
that
opinion
,
that
not
so
many
,
by
several
thousand
,
have
die
;
for
it
be
observe
,
and
I
could
give
several
instance
within
the
compass
of
my
own
knowledge
,
where
a
servant
have
be
take
sick
,
and
the
family
have
either
time
to
send
him
out
or
retire
from
the
house
and
leave
the
sick
person
,
as
I
have
say
above
,
they
have
all
be
preserve
;
whereas
when
,
upon
one
or
more
sickening
in
a
family
,
the
house
have
be
shut
up
,
the
whole
family
have
perish
,
and
the
bearer
be
oblige
to
go
in
to
fetch
out
the
dead
body
,
not
be
able
to
bring
them
to
the
door
,
and
at
last
none
leave
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
(

)
<EOS>
this
put
it
out
of
question
to
me
,
that
the
calamity
be
spread
by
infection
;
that
be
to
say
,
by
some
certain
steam
or
fume
,
which
the
physician
call
effluvia
,
by
the
breath
,
or
by
the
sweat
,
or
by
the
stench
of
the
sore
of
the
sick
person
,
or
some
other
way
,
perhaps
,
beyond
even
the
reach
of
the
physician
themselves
,
which
effluvia
affect
the
sound
who
come
within
certain
distance
of
the
sick
,
immediately
penetrate
the
vital
part
of
the
say
sound
person
,
put
their
blood
into
an
immediate
ferment
,
and
agitate
their
spirit
to
that
degree
which
it
be
find
they
be
agitate
;
and
so
those
newly
infect
person
communicate
it
in
the
same
manner
to
other
.
<EOS>
and
this
I
shall
give
some
instance
of
,
that
can
not
but
convince
those
who
seriously
consider
it
;
and
I
can
not
but
with
some
wonder
find
some
people
,
now
the
contagion
be
over
,
talk
of
its
be
an
immediate
stroke
from
Heaven
,
without
the
agency
of
mean
,
have
commission
to
strike
this
and
that
particular
person
,
and
none
other
 
which
I
look
upon
with
contempt
as
the
effect
of
manifest
ignorance
and
enthusiasm
;
likewise
the
opinion
of
other
,
who
talk
of
infection
be
carry
on
by
the
air
only
,
by
carry
with
it
vast
number
of
insect
and
invisible
creature
,
who
enter
into
the
body
with
the
breath
,
or
even
at
the
pore
with
the
air
,
and
there
generate
or
emit
most
acute
poison
,
or
poisonous
ovae
or
egg
,
which
mingle
themselves
with
the
blood
,
and
so
infect
the
body
:
a
discourse
full
of
learned
simplicity
,
and
manifest
to
be
so
by
universal
experience
;
but
I
shall
say
more
to
this
case
in
its
order
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
here
take
further
notice
that
nothing
be
more
fatal
to
the
inhabitant
of
this
city
than
the
supine
negligence
of
the
people
themselves
,
who
,
during
the
long
notice
or
warn
they
have
of
the
visitation
,
make
no
provision
for
it
by
lay
in
store
of
provision
,
or
of
other
necessary
,
by
which
they
may
have
live
retire
and
within
their
own
house
,
as
I
have
observe
other
do
,
and
who
be
in
a
great
measure
preserve
by
that
caution
;
nor
be
they
,
after
they
be
a
little
harden
to
it
,
so
shy
of
converse
with
one
another
,
when
actually
infect
,
as
they
be
at
first
:
no
,
though
they
know
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
I
be
one
of
those
thoughtless
one
that
have
make
so
little
provision
that
my
servant
be
oblige
to
go
out
of
door
to
buy
every
trifle
by
penny
and
halfpenny
,
just
as
before
it
begin
,
even
till
my
experience
show
me
the
folly
<EOS>
,
I
begin
to
be
wise
<EOS>
so
late
that
I
have
scarce
time
to
store
myself
sufficient
for
our
common
subsistence
for
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
in
family
only
an
ancient
woman
that
manage
the
house
,
a
maid
-
servant
,
two
apprentice
,
and
myself
;
and
the
plague
begin
to
increase
about
us
,
I
have
many
sad
thought
about
what
course
I
should
take
,
and
how
I
should
act
.
<EOS>
the
many
dismal
object
which
happen
everywhere
as
I
go
about
the
street
,
have
fill
my
mind
with
a
great
deal
of
horror
for
fear
of
the
distemper
,
which
be
indeed
very
horrible
in
itself
,
and
in
some
more
than
in
other
.
<EOS>
the
swelling
,
which
be
generally
in
the
neck
or
groin
,
when
they
grow
hard
and
would
not
break
,
grow
so
painful
that
it
be
equal
to
the
most
exquisite
torture
;
and
some
,
not
able
to
bear
the
torment
,
throw
themselves
out
at
window
or
shoot
themselves
,
or
otherwise
make
themselves
away
,
and
<EOS>
I
see
several
dismal
object
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
other
,
unable
to
contain
themselves
,
vent
their
pain
by
incessant
roaring
,
and
such
loud
and
lamentable
cry
be
to
be
hear
as
we
walk
along
the
street
that
would
pierce
the
very
heart
to
think
of
,
especially
when
it
be
to
be
consider
that
the
same
dreadful
scourge
may
be
expect
every
moment
to
seize
upon
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
but
that
now
I
begin
to
faint
in
my
resolution
;
my
heart
fail
me
very
much
,
and
sorely
I
repent
of
my
rashness
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
be
out
,
and
meet
with
such
terrible
thing
as
these
I
have
talk
of
,
I
say
I
repent
my
rashness
in
venture
to
abide
in
town
.
<EOS>
I
wish
often
that
I
have
not
take
upon
me
to
stay
,
but
have
go
away
with
my
brother
and
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
terrify
by
those
frightful
object
,
I
would
retire
home
sometimes
and
resolve
to
go
out
no
more
;
and
perhaps
I
would
keep
those
resolution
for
three
or
four
day
,
which
time
I
spend
in
the
most
serious
thankfulness
for
my
preservation
and
the
preservation
of
my
family
,
and
the
constant
confession
of
my
sin
,
give
myself
up
to
God
every
day
,
and
apply
to
Him
with
fasting
,
humiliation
,
and
meditation
.
<EOS>
such
interval
as
I
have
I
employ
in
read
book
and
in
write
down
my
memorandum
of
what
occur
to
me
every
day
,
and
out
of
which
<EOS>
afterwards
I
take
most
of
this
work
,
as
it
relate
to
my
observation
without
door
.
<EOS>
what
I
write
of
my
private
meditation
I
reserve
for
private
use
,
and
desire
it
may
not
be
make
public
on
any
account
<EOS>
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
I
also
write
other
meditation
upon
divine
subject
,
such
as
occur
to
me
at
that
time
and
be
profitable
to
myself
,
but
not
fit
for
any
other
view
,
and
therefore
I
say
no
more
of
that
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
very
good
friend
,
a
physician
,
whose
name
be
Heath
,
whom
I
frequently
visit
during
this
dismal
time
,
and
to
whose
advice
I
be
very
much
oblige
for
many
thing
which
he
direct
me
to
take
,
by
way
of
prevent
the
infection
when
I
go
out
,
as
he
find
I
frequently
do
,
and
to
hold
in
my
mouth
when
I
be
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
He
also
come
very
often
to
see
me
,
and
as
he
be
a
good
Christian
as
well
as
a
good
physician
,
his
agreeable
conversation
be
a
very
great
support
to
me
in
the
bad
of
this
terrible
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
beginning
of
August
,
and
the
plague
grow
very
violent
and
terrible
in
the
place
where
I
live
,
and
Dr
Heath
come
to
visit
me
,
and
find
that
I
venture
so
often
out
in
the
street
,
earnestly
persuade
me
to
lock
myself
up
and
my
family
,
and
not
to
suffer
any
of
us
to
go
out
of
door
;
to
keep
all
our
window
fast
,
shutter
and
curtain
close
,
and
never
to
open
them
;
but
first
,
to
make
a
very
strong
smoke
in
the
room
where
the
window
or
door
be
to
be
open
,
with
rozen
and
pitch
,
brimstone
or
gunpowder
and
the
like
;
and
we
do
this
for
some
time
;
but
as
I
have
not
lay
in
a
store
of
provision
for
such
a
retreat
,
it
be
impossible
that
we
could
keep
within
door
entirely
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
attempt
,
though
it
be
so
very
late
,
to
do
something
towards
it
;
and
first
,
as
I
have
convenience
both
for
brewing
and
baking
,
I
go
and
buy
two
sack
of
meal
,
and
for
several
week
,
have
an
oven
,
we
bake
all
our
own
bread
;
also
I
buy
malt
,
and
brew
as
much
beer
as
all
the
cask
I
have
would
hold
,
and
which
seem
enough
to
serve
my
house
for
five
or
six
week
;
also
I
lay
in
a
quantity
of
salt
butter
and
Cheshire
cheese
;
but
I
have
no
flesh
-
meat
,
and
the
plague
rage
so
violently
among
the
butcher
and
slaughter
-
house
on
the
other
side
of
our
street
,
where
they
be
know
to
dwell
in
great
number
,
that
it
be
not
advisable
so
much
as
to
go
over
the
street
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
must
observe
again
,
that
this
necessity
of
go
out
of
our
house
to
buy
provision
be
in
a
great
measure
the
ruin
of
the
whole
city
,
for
the
people
catch
the
distemper
on
these
occasion
one
of
another
,
and
even
the
provision
themselves
be
often
tainted
;
at
least
I
have
great
reason
to
believe
so
;
and
therefore
I
can
not
say
with
satisfaction
what
I
know
be
repeat
with
great
assurance
,
that
the
market
-
people
and
such
as
bring
provision
to
town
be
never
infect
.
<EOS>
I
be
certain
the
butcher
of
Whitechappel
,
where
the
great
part
of
the
flesh
-
meat
be
kill
,
be
dreadfully
visit
,
and
that
at
least
to
such
a
degree
that
few
of
their
shop
be
keep
open
,
and
those
that
remain
of
them
kill
their
meat
at
Mile
End
and
that
way
,
and
bring
it
to
market
upon
horse
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
poor
people
could
not
lay
up
provision
,
and
there
be
a
necessity
that
they
must
go
to
market
to
buy
,
and
other
to
send
servant
or
their
child
;
and
as
this
be
a
necessity
which
renew
itself
daily
,
it
bring
abundance
of
unsound
people
to
the
market
,
and
a
great
many
that
go
thither
sound
bring
death
home
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
people
use
all
possible
precaution
.
<EOS>
when
any
one
buy
a
joint
of
meat
in
the
market
they
would
not
take
it
off
the
butcher
's
hand
,
but
take
it
off
the
hook
themselves
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
butcher
would
not
touch
the
money
,
but
have
it
put
into
a
pot
full
of
vinegar
,
which
he
keep
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
buyer
carry
always
small
money
to
make
up
any
odd
sum
,
that
they
may
take
no
change
.
<EOS>
They
carry
bottle
of
scent
and
perfume
in
their
hand
,
and
all
the
mean
that
could
be
use
be
use
,
but
then
the
poor
could
not
do
even
these
thing
,
and
they
go
at
all
hazard
.
  
<EOS>
innumerable
dismal
story
we
hear
every
day
on
this
very
account
.
<EOS>
sometimes
a
man
or
woman
drop
down
dead
in
the
very
market
,
for
many
people
that
have
the
plague
upon
them
know
nothing
of
it
till
the
inward
gangrene
have
affect
their
vital
,
and
they
die
in
a
few
moment
.
<EOS>
this
cause
that
many
die
frequently
in
that
manner
in
the
street
suddenly
,
without
any
warning
;
other
perhaps
have
time
to
go
to
the
next
bulk
or
stall
,
or
to
any
door
-
porch
,
and
just
sit
down
and
die
,
as
I
have
say
before
.
  
<EOS>
these
object
be
so
frequent
in
the
street
that
when
the
plague
come
to
be
very
rage
on
one
side
,
there
be
scarce
any
passing
by
the
street
but
that
several
dead
body
would
be
lie
here
and
there
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
it
be
observable
that
though
at
first
the
people
would
stop
as
they
go
along
and
call
to
the
neighbour
to
come
out
on
such
an
occasion
,
yet
afterward
no
notice
be
take
of
them
;
but
that
if
at
any
time
we
find
a
corpse
lie
,
go
across
the
way
and
not
come
near
it
;
or
,
if
in
a
narrow
lane
or
passage
,
go
back
again
and
seek
some
other
way
to
go
on
the
business
we
be
upon
;
and
in
those
case
the
corpse
be
always
leave
till
the
officer
have
notice
to
come
and
take
them
away
,
or
till
night
,
when
the
bearer
attend
the
dead
-
cart
would
take
them
up
and
carry
them
away
.
<EOS>
nor
do
those
undaunte
creature
who
perform
these
office
fail
to
search
their
pocket
,
and
sometimes
strip
off
their
clothe
if
they
be
well
dress
,
as
sometimes
they
be
,
and
carry
off
what
they
could
get
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
market
.
<EOS>
the
butcher
take
that
care
that
if
any
person
die
in
the
market
they
have
the
officer
always
at
band
to
take
them
up
upon
hand
-
barrow
and
carry
them
to
the
next
churchyard
;
and
this
be
so
frequent
that
such
be
not
enter
in
the
weekly
bill
,
"
find
dead
in
the
street
or
field
"
,
as
be
the
case
now
,
but
they
go
into
the
general
article
of
the
great
distemper
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
fury
of
the
distemper
increase
to
such
a
degree
that
even
the
market
be
but
very
thinly
furnish
with
provision
or
frequent
with
buyer
compare
to
what
they
be
before
;
and
the
Lord
Mayor
cause
the
country
people
who
bring
provision
to
be
stop
in
the
street
lead
into
the
town
,
and
to
sit
down
there
with
their
good
,
where
they
sell
what
they
bring
,
and
go
immediately
away
;
and
this
encourage
the
country
people
greatly
-
to
do
so
,
for
they
sell
their
provision
at
the
very
entrance
into
the
town
,
and
even
in
the
field
,
as
particularly
in
the
field
beyond
Whitechappel
,
in
Spittlefields
;
also
in
St
George
's
Fields
in
southwark
,
in
Bunhill
Fields
,
and
in
a
great
field
call
Wood
's
close
,
near
Islington
.
<EOS>
Thither
the
Lord
Mayor
,
aldermen
,
and
magistrate
send
their
officer
and
servant
to
buy
for
their
family
,
themselves
keep
within
door
as
much
as
possible
,
and
the
like
do
many
other
people
;
and
after
this
method
be
take
the
country
people
come
with
great
cheerfulness
,
and
bring
provision
of
all
sort
,
and
very
seldom
get
any
harm
,
which
,
I
suppose
,
add
also
to
that
report
of
their
be
miraculously
preserve
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
my
little
family
,
have
thus
,
as
I
have
say
,
lay
in
a
store
of
bread
,
butter
,
cheese
,
and
beer
,
I
take
my
friend
and
physician
's
advice
,
and
lock
myself
up
,
and
my
family
,
and
resolve
to
suffer
the
hardship
of
live
a
few
month
without
flesh
-
meat
,
rather
than
to
purchase
it
at
the
hazard
of
our
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
I
confine
my
family
,
I
could
not
prevail
upon
my
unsatisfied
curiosity
to
stay
within
entirely
myself
;
and
though
I
generally
come
fright
and
terrified
home
,
vet
I
could
not
restrain
;
only
that
indeed
I
do
not
do
it
so
frequently
as
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
some
little
obligation
,
indeed
,
upon
me
to
go
to
my
brother
's
house
,
which
be
in
Coleman
Street
parish
and
which
he
have
leave
to
my
care
,
and
I
go
at
first
every
day
,
but
afterwards
only
once
or
twice
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
walk
I
have
many
dismal
scene
before
my
eye
,
as
particularly
of
person
fall
dead
in
the
street
,
terrible
shriek
and
screeching
of
woman
,
who
,
in
their
agony
,
would
throw
open
their
chamber
window
and
cry
out
in
a
dismal
,
surprising
manner
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
describe
the
variety
of
posture
in
which
the
passion
of
the
poor
people
would
express
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
pass
through
Tokenhouse
Yard
,
in
Lothbury
,
of
a
sudden
a
casement
violently
open
just
over
my
head
,
and
a
woman
give
three
frightful
screech
,
and
then
cry
,
"
oh
!
death
,
death
,
death
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
most
inimitable
tone
,
and
which
strike
me
with
horror
and
a
chillness
in
my
very
blood
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
to
be
see
in
the
whole
street
,
neither
do
any
other
window
open
,
for
people
have
no
curiosity
now
in
any
case
,
nor
could
anybody
help
one
another
,
so
I
go
on
to
pass
into
Bell
Alley
.
  
<EOS>
just
in
Bell
Alley
,
on
the
right
hand
of
the
passage
,
there
be
a
more
terrible
cry
than
that
,
though
it
be
not
so
direct
out
at
the
window
;
but
the
whole
family
be
in
a
terrible
fright
,
and
I
could
hear
woman
and
child
run
scream
about
the
room
like
distract
,
when
a
garret
-
window
open
and
somebody
from
a
window
on
the
other
side
the
alley
call
and
ask
,
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
upon
which
,
from
the
first
window
,
it
be
answer
,
"
oh
Lord
,
my
old
master
have
hang
himself
!
"
<EOS>
the
other
ask
again
,
"
be
he
quite
dead
?
"
and
the
first
answer
,
"
ay
,
ay
,
quite
dead
;
quite
dead
and
cold
!
"
<EOS>
this
person
be
a
merchant
and
a
deputy
alderman
,
and
very
rich
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
to
mention
the
name
,
though
I
know
his
name
too
,
but
that
would
be
an
hardship
to
the
family
,
which
be
now
flourish
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
but
one
;
it
be
scarce
credible
what
dreadful
case
happen
in
particular
family
every
day
.
<EOS>
People
in
the
rage
of
the
distemper
,
or
in
the
torment
of
their
swelling
,
which
be
indeed
intolerable
,
run
out
of
their
own
government
,
raving
and
distract
,
and
oftentime
lay
violent
hand
upon
themselves
,
throw
themselves
out
at
their
window
,
shoot
themselves
&
c.
;
<EOS>
mother
murder
their
own
child
in
their
lunacy
,
some
die
of
mere
grief
as
a
passion
,
some
of
mere
fright
and
surprise
without
any
infection
at
all
,
other
fright
into
idiotism
and
foolish
distraction
,
some
into
despair
and
lunacy
,
other
into
melancholy
madness
.
  
<EOS>
the
pain
of
the
swelling
be
in
particular
very
violent
,
and
to
some
intolerable
;
the
physician
and
surgeon
may
be
say
to
have
torture
many
poor
creature
even
to
death
.
<EOS>
the
swelling
in
some
grow
hard
,
and
they
apply
violent
drawing
-
plaister
or
poultice
to
break
them
,
and
if
these
do
not
do
they
cut
and
scarify
them
in
a
terrible
manner
.
<EOS>
in
some
those
swelling
be
make
hard
partly
by
the
force
of
the
distemper
and
partly
by
their
be
too
violently
draw
,
and
be
so
hard
that
no
instrument
could
cut
them
,
and
then
they
burn
them
with
caustic
,
so
that
many
die
rave
mad
with
the
torment
,
and
some
in
the
very
operation
.
<EOS>
in
these
distress
,
some
,
for
want
of
help
to
hold
them
down
in
their
bed
,
or
to
look
to
them
,
lay
hand
upon
themselves
as
above
.
<EOS>
some
break
out
into
the
street
,
perhaps
naked
,
and
would
run
directly
down
to
the
river
if
they
be
not
stop
by
the
watchman
or
other
officer
,
and
plunge
themselves
into
the
water
wherever
they
find
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
often
pierce
my
very
soul
to
hear
the
groans
and
cry
of
those
who
be
thus
torment
,
but
of
the
two
this
be
count
the
most
promising
particular
in
the
whole
infection
,
for
if
these
swelling
could
be
bring
to
a
head
,
and
to
break
and
run
,
or
,
as
the
surgeon
call
it
,
to
digest
,
the
patient
generally
recover
;
whereas
those
who
,
like
the
gentlewoman
's
daughter
,
be
strike
with
death
at
the
beginning
,
and
have
the
token
come
out
upon
them
,
often
go
about
indifferent
easy
till
a
little
before
they
die
,
and
some
till
the
moment
they
drop
down
,
as
in
apoplexy
and
epilepsy
be
often
the
case
.
<EOS>
such
would
be
take
suddenly
very
sick
,
and
would
run
to
a
bench
or
bulk
,
or
any
convenient
place
that
offer
itself
,
or
to
their
own
house
if
possible
,
as
I
mention
before
,
and
there
sit
down
,
grow
faint
,
and
die
.
<EOS>
this
kind
of
dying
be
much
the
same
as
it
be
with
those
who
die
of
common
mortification
,
who
die
swoon
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
go
away
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
such
as
die
thus
have
very
little
notice
of
their
be
infect
at
all
till
the
gangrene
be
spread
through
their
whole
body
;
nor
could
physician
themselves
<EOS>
know
certainly
how
it
be
with
them
till
they
open
their
breast
or
other
part
of
their
body
and
see
the
token
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
at
this
time
a
great
many
frightful
story
tell
us
of
nurse
and
watchman
who
look
after
the
die
people
;
that
be
to
say
,
hire
nurse
who
attend
infect
people
,
use
them
barbarously
,
starve
them
,
smother
them
,
or
by
other
wicked
mean
hasten
their
end
,
that
be
to
say
,
murder
of
them
;
and
watchmen
,
be
set
to
guard
house
that
be
shut
up
when
there
have
be
but
one
person
leave
,
and
perhaps
that
one
lie
sick
,
that
they
have
break
in
and
murder
that
body
,
and
immediately
throw
them
out
into
the
dead
-
cart
!
<EOS>
and
so
they
have
go
scarce
cold
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
but
that
some
such
murder
be
commit
,
and
I
think
two
be
send
to
prison
for
it
,
but
die
before
they
could
be
try
;
and
I
have
hear
that
three
other
,
at
several
time
,
be
excuse
for
murder
of
that
kind
;
but
I
must
say
I
believe
nothing
of
its
be
<EOS>
so
common
a
crime
as
some
have
since
be
pleased
to
say
,
nor
do
it
seem
to
be
so
rational
where
the
people
be
bring
so
low
as
not
to
be
able
to
help
themselves
,
for
such
seldom
recover
,
and
there
be
no
temptation
to
commit
a
murder
,
at
least
none
equal
to
the
fact
,
where
they
be
sure
person
would
die
in
so
short
a
time
,
and
could
not
live
.
  
<EOS>
that
there
be
a
great
many
robbery
and
wicked
practice
commit
even
in
this
dreadful
time
I
do
not
deny
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
avarice
be
so
strong
in
some
that
they
would
run
any
hazard
to
steal
and
to
plunder
;
and
particularly
in
house
where
all
the
family
or
inhabitant
have
be
dead
and
carry
out
,
they
would
break
in
at
all
hazard
,
and
without
regard
to
the
danger
of
infection
,
take
even
the
clothe
off
the
dead
body
and
the
bed
-
clothe
from
other
where
they
lay
dead
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
I
suppose
,
must
be
the
case
of
a
family
in
Houndsditch
,
where
a
man
and
his
daughter
,
the
rest
of
the
family
be
,
as
I
suppose
,
carry
away
before
by
the
dead
-
cart
,
be
find
stark
naked
,
one
in
one
chamber
and
one
in
another
,
lie
dead
on
the
floor
,
and
the
clothe
of
the
bed
,
from
whence
'
tis
suppose
they
be
roll
off
by
thief
,
steal
and
carry
quite
away
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
to
be
observe
that
the
woman
be
in
all
this
calamity
the
most
rash
,
fearless
,
and
desperate
creature
,
and
as
there
be
vast
number
that
go
about
as
nurse
to
tend
those
that
be
sick
,
they
commit
a
great
many
petty
thievery
in
the
house
where
they
be
employ
;
and
some
of
them
be
publicly
whip
for
it
,
when
perhaps
they
ought
rather
to
have
be
hang
for
example
,
for
number
of
house
be
rob
on
these
occasion
,
till
at
length
the
parish
officer
be
send
to
recommend
nurse
to
the
sick
,
and
always
take
an
account
whom
it
be
they
send
,
so
as
that
they
may
call
them
to
account
if
the
house
have
be
abuse
where
they
be
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
robbery
extend
chiefly
to
wear
-
clothe
,
linen
,
and
what
ring
or
money
they
could
come
at
when
the
person
die
who
be
under
their
care
,
but
not
to
a
general
plunder
of
the
house
;
and
I
could
give
you
an
account
of
one
of
these
nurse
,
who
,
several
year
after
,
be
on
her
deathbed
,
confess
with
the
utmost
horror
the
robbery
she
have
commit
at
the
time
of
her
be
a
nurse
,
and
by
which
she
have
enrich
herself
to
a
great
degree
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
murder
,
I
do
not
find
that
there
be
ever
any
proof
of
the
fact
in
the
manner
as
it
have
be
report
,
except
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
They
do
tell
me
,
indeed
,
of
a
nurse
in
one
place
that
lay
a
wet
cloth
upon
the
face
of
a
die
patient
whom
she
tend
,
and
so
put
an
end
to
his
life
,
who
be
just
expire
before
;
and
another
that
smother
a
young
woman
she
be
look
to
when
she
be
in
a
fainting
fit
,
and
would
have
come
to
herself
;
some
that
kill
them
by
give
them
one
thing
,
some
another
,
and
some
starve
them
by
give
them
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
these
story
have
two
mark
of
suspicion
that
always
attend
them
,
which
cause
me
always
to
slight
them
and
to
look
on
them
as
mere
story
that
people
continually
fright
one
another
with
.
<EOS>
first
,
that
wherever
it
be
that
we
hear
it
,
they
always
place
the
scene
at
the
farther
end
of
the
town
,
opposite
or
most
remote
from
where
you
be
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
if
you
hear
it
in
Whitechappel
,
it
have
happen
at
St
Giles
's
,
or
at
Westminster
,
or
Holborn
,
or
that
end
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
if
you
hear
of
it
at
that
end
of
the
town
,
then
it
be
do
in
Whitechappel
,
or
the
Minories
,
or
about
Cripplegate
parish
.
<EOS>
if
you
hear
of
it
in
the
city
,
why
,
then
it
happen
in
Southwark
;
and
if
you
hear
of
it
in
Southwark
,
then
it
be
do
in
the
city
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
of
what
part
soever
you
hear
the
story
,
the
particular
be
always
the
same
,
especially
that
of
lay
a
wet
double
clout
on
a
die
man
's
face
,
and
that
of
smother
a
young
gentlewoman
;
so
that
it
be
apparent
,
at
least
to
my
judgement
,
that
there
be
more
of
tale
than
of
truth
in
those
thing
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
I
can
not
say
but
it
have
some
effect
upon
the
people
,
and
particularly
that
,
as
I
say
before
,
they
grow
more
cautious
whom
they
take
into
their
house
,
and
whom
they
trust
their
life
with
,
and
have
them
always
recommend
if
they
could
;
and
where
they
could
not
find
such
,
for
they
be
not
very
plenty
,
they
apply
to
the
parish
officer
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
again
the
misery
of
that
time
lie
upon
the
poor
who
,
be
infect
,
have
neither
food
or
physic
,
neither
physician
or
apothecary
to
assist
them
,
or
nurse
to
attend
them
.
<EOS>
many
of
those
die
call
for
help
,
and
even
for
sustenance
,
out
at
their
window
in
a
most
miserable
and
deplorable
manner
;
but
it
must
be
add
that
whenever
the
case
of
such
person
or
family
be
represent
to
my
Lord
Mayor
they
always
be
relieve
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
in
some
house
where
the
people
be
not
very
poor
,
yet
where
they
have
send
perhaps
their
wife
and
child
away
,
and
if
they
have
any
servant
they
have
be
dismiss
;
 
I
say
it
be
true
that
to
save
the
expense
,
many
such
as
these
shut
themselves
in
,
and
not
have
help
,
die
alone
.
  
<EOS>
a
neighbour
and
acquaintance
of
mine
,
have
some
money
owe
to
him
from
a
shopkeeper
in
Whitecross
Street
or
thereabout
,
send
his
apprentice
,
a
youth
about
eighteen
year
of
age
,
to
endeavour
to
get
the
money
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
the
door
,
and
find
it
shut
,
knock
pretty
hard
;
and
,
as
he
think
,
hear
somebody
answer
within
,
but
be
not
sure
,
so
he
wait
,
and
after
some
stay
knock
again
,
and
then
a
third
time
,
when
he
hear
somebody
come
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
the
man
of
the
house
come
to
the
door
;
he
have
on
his
breech
or
drawer
,
and
a
yellow
flannel
waistcoat
,
no
stocking
,
a
pair
of
slip
-
shoe
,
a
white
cap
on
his
head
,
and
,
as
the
young
man
say
,
"
death
in
his
face
"
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
open
the
door
,
say
he
,
"
what
do
you
disturb
me
thus
for
?
"
<EOS>
the
boy
,
though
a
little
surprised
,
reply
,
"
I
come
from
such
a
one
,
and
my
master
send
me
for
the
money
which
he
say
you
know
of
.
"
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
child
,
"
return
the
live
ghost
;
"
call
as
you
go
by
at
Cripplegate
Church
,
and
bid
them
re
the
bell
"
;
and
with
these
word
shut
the
door
again
,
and
go
up
again
,
and
die
the
same
day
;
nay
,
perhaps
the
same
hour
.
<EOS>
this
the
young
man
tell
me
himself
,
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
while
the
plague
be
not
come
to
a
height
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
in
June
,
towards
the
latter
end
of
the
month
;
it
must
be
before
the
dead
-
cart
come
about
,
and
while
they
use
the
ceremony
of
ring
the
bell
for
the
dead
,
which
be
over
for
certain
,
in
that
parish
at
least
,
before
the
month
of
July
,
for
by
the
25th
of
July
<EOS>
there
die
550
and
upwards
in
a
week
,
and
then
they
could
no
more
bury
in
form
,
rich
or
poor
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
mention
above
that
notwithstanding
this
dreadful
calamity
,
yet
the
number
of
thief
be
abroad
upon
all
occasion
,
where
they
have
find
any
prey
,
and
that
these
be
generally
woman
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
morning
<EOS>
about
eleven
o'clock
,
I
have
walk
out
to
my
brother
's
house
in
Coleman
Street
parish
,
as
I
often
do
,
to
see
that
all
be
safe
.
  
<EOS>
My
brother
's
house
have
a
little
court
before
it
,
and
a
brick
wall
and
a
gate
in
it
,
and
within
that
several
warehouse
where
his
good
of
several
sort
lie
.
<EOS>
It
happen
that
in
one
of
these
warehouse
be
several
pack
of
woman
's
high
-
crown
hat
,
which
come
out
of
the
country
and
be
,
as
I
suppose
,
for
exportation
:
<EOS>
whither
,
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
that
when
I
come
near
my
brother
's
door
,
which
be
in
a
place
they
call
Swan
Alley
,
I
meet
three
or
four
woman
with
high
-
crown
hat
on
their
head
;
and
,
as
I
remember
afterwards
,
one
,
if
not
more
,
have
some
hat
likewise
in
their
hand
;
but
as
I
do
not
see
them
come
out
at
my
brother
's
door
,
and
not
know
that
my
brother
have
any
such
good
in
his
warehouse
,
I
do
not
offer
to
say
anything
to
them
,
but
go
across
the
way
to
shun
meet
them
,
as
be
usual
to
do
at
that
time
,
for
fear
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
nearer
to
the
gate
I
meet
another
woman
with
more
hat
come
out
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
what
business
,
mistress
,
"
say
I
,
"
have
you
have
there
?
"
<EOS>
"
there
be
more
people
there
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
have
have
no
more
business
there
than
they
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
hasty
to
get
to
the
gate
then
,
and
say
no
more
to
her
,
by
which
mean
she
get
away
.
<EOS>
but
just
as
I
come
to
the
gate
,
I
see
two
more
come
across
the
yard
to
come
out
with
hat
also
on
their
head
and
under
their
arm
,
at
which
I
throw
the
gate
to
behind
me
,
which
have
a
spring
lock
fasten
itself
;
and
turn
to
the
woman
,
<EOS>
"
Forsooth
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
be
you
do
here
?
"
and
seize
upon
the
hat
,
and
take
them
from
them
.
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
who
,
I
confess
,
do
not
look
like
a
thief
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
say
she
,
"
we
be
wrong
,
but
we
be
tell
they
be
good
that
have
no
owner
.
<EOS>
be
pleased
to
take
them
again
;
and
look
yonder
,
there
be
more
such
customer
as
we
.
"
<EOS>
She
cry
and
look
pitifully
,
<EOS>
so
I
take
the
hat
from
her
and
open
the
gate
,
and
bade
them
be
go
,
for
I
pity
the
woman
indeed
;
but
when
I
look
towards
the
warehouse
,
as
she
direct
,
there
be
six
or
seven
more
,
all
woman
,
fit
themselves
with
hat
as
unconcerned
and
quiet
as
if
they
have
be
at
a
hatter
's
shop
buying
for
their
money
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
,
not
at
the
sight
of
so
many
thief
only
,
but
at
the
circumstance
I
be
in
;
be
now
to
thrust
myself
in
among
so
many
people
,
who
for
some
week
have
be
so
shy
of
myself
that
if
I
meet
anybody
in
the
street
I
would
cross
the
way
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
equally
surprised
,
though
on
another
account
.
<EOS>
They
all
tell
me
they
be
neighbour
,
that
they
have
hear
anyone
may
take
them
,
that
they
be
nobody
's
good
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
I
talk
big
to
them
at
first
,
go
back
to
the
gate
and
take
out
the
key
,
so
that
they
be
all
my
prisoner
,
threaten
to
lock
them
all
into
the
warehouse
,
and
go
and
fetch
my
Lord
Mayor
's
officer
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
beg
heartily
,
protest
they
find
the
gate
open
,
and
the
warehouse
door
open
;
and
that
it
have
no
doubt
be
break
open
by
some
who
expect
to
find
good
of
great
value
:
which
indeed
be
reasonable
to
believe
,
because
the
lock
be
broke
,
and
a
padlock
that
hang
to
the
door
on
the
outside
also
loose
,
and
not
abundance
of
the
hat
carry
away
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
I
consider
that
this
be
not
a
time
to
be
cruel
and
rigorous
;
and
besides
that
,
it
would
necessarily
oblige
me
to
go
much
about
,
to
have
several
people
come
to
me
,
and
I
go
to
several
whose
circumstance
of
health
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
;
and
that
even
at
this
time
the
plague
be
so
high
as
that
there
die
4000
a
week
;
so
that
in
show
my
resentment
,
or
even
in
seek
justice
for
my
brother
's
good
,
I
may
lose
my
own
life
;
so
I
content
myself
with
take
the
name
and
place
where
some
of
them
live
,
who
be
really
inhabitant
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
threaten
that
my
brother
should
call
them
to
an
account
for
it
when
he
return
to
his
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
talk
a
little
upon
another
foot
with
them
,
and
ask
them
how
they
could
do
such
thing
as
these
in
a
time
of
such
general
calamity
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
face
of
God
's
most
dreadful
judgement
,
when
the
plague
be
at
their
very
door
,
and
,
it
may
be
,
in
their
very
house
,
and
they
do
not
know
but
that
the
dead
-
cart
may
stop
at
their
door
in
a
few
hour
to
carry
them
to
their
grave
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
perceive
that
my
discourse
make
much
impression
upon
them
all
that
while
,
till
it
happen
that
there
come
two
man
of
the
neighbourhood
,
hearing
of
the
disturbance
,
and
know
my
brother
,
for
they
have
be
both
dependent
upon
his
family
,
and
they
come
to
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
as
I
say
,
neighbour
,
presently
know
three
of
the
woman
and
tell
me
who
they
be
and
where
they
live
;
and
it
seem
they
have
give
me
a
true
account
of
themselves
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
bring
these
two
man
to
a
further
remembrance
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
one
be
John
Hayward
,
who
be
at
that
time
undersexton
of
the
parish
of
St
Stephen
,
Coleman
Street
.
<EOS>
by
undersexton
be
understand
at
that
time
gravedigger
and
bearer
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
this
man
carry
,
or
assist
to
carry
,
all
the
dead
to
their
grave
which
be
bury
in
that
large
parish
,
and
who
be
carry
in
form
;
and
after
that
form
of
burying
be
stop
,
go
with
the
dead
-
cart
and
the
bell
to
fetch
the
dead
body
from
the
house
where
they
lay
,
and
fetch
many
of
them
out
of
the
chamber
and
house
;
for
the
parish
be
,
and
be
still
,
remarkable
particularly
,
above
all
the
parish
in
London
,
for
a
great
number
of
alley
and
thoroughfare
,
very
long
,
into
which
no
cart
could
come
,
and
where
they
be
oblige
to
go
and
fetch
the
body
a
very
long
way
;
which
alley
now
remain
to
witness
it
,
such
as
White
's
Alley
,
Cross
Key
Court
,
Swan
Alley
,
Bell
Alley
,
White
Horse
Alley
,
and
many
more
.
<EOS>
here
they
go
with
a
kind
of
hand
-
barrow
and
lay
the
dead
body
on
it
,
and
carry
them
out
to
the
cart
;
which
work
he
perform
and
never
have
the
distemper
at
all
,
but
live
about
twenty
year
after
it
,
and
be
sexton
of
the
parish
to
the
time
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
His
wife
at
the
same
time
be
a
nurse
to
infect
people
,
and
tend
many
that
die
in
the
parish
,
be
for
her
honesty
recommend
by
the
parish
officer
;
yet
she
never
be
infect
neither
.
  
<EOS>
He
never
use
any
preservative
against
the
infection
,
other
than
hold
garlic
and
rue
in
his
mouth
,
and
smoking
tobacco
.
<EOS>
this
I
also
have
from
his
own
mouth
.
<EOS>
and
his
wife
's
remedy
be
wash
her
head
in
vinegar
and
sprinkle
her
head
-
clothe
so
with
vinegar
as
to
keep
them
always
moist
,
and
if
the
smell
of
any
of
those
she
wait
on
be
more
than
ordinary
offensive
,
she
snuff
vinegar
up
her
nose
and
sprinkle
vinegar
upon
her
head
-
clothe
,
and
hold
a
handkerchief
wet
with
vinegar
to
her
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
that
though
the
plague
be
chiefly
among
the
poor
,
yet
be
the
poor
the
most
venturous
and
fearless
of
it
,
and
go
about
their
employment
with
a
sort
of
brutal
courage
;
I
must
call
it
so
,
for
it
be
found
neither
on
religion
nor
prudence
;
scarce
do
they
use
any
caution
,
but
run
into
any
business
which
they
could
get
employment
in
,
though
it
be
the
most
hazardous
.
<EOS>
such
be
that
of
tend
the
sick
,
watch
house
shut
up
,
carry
infected
person
to
the
pest
-
house
,
and
,
which
be
still
bad
,
carry
the
dead
away
to
their
grave
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
under
this
John
Hayward
's
care
,
and
within
his
bound
,
that
the
story
of
the
piper
,
with
which
people
have
make
themselves
so
merry
,
happen
,
and
he
assure
me
that
it
be
true
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
it
be
a
blind
piper
;
but
,
as
John
tell
me
,
the
fellow
be
not
blind
,
but
an
ignorant
,
weak
,
poor
man
,
and
usually
walk
his
round
about
ten
o'clock
at
night
and
go
pipe
along
from
door
to
door
,
and
the
people
usually
take
him
in
at
public
-
house
where
they
know
him
,
and
would
give
him
drink
and
victual
,
and
sometimes
farthing
;
and
he
in
return
would
pipe
and
sing
and
talk
simply
,
which
divert
the
people
;
and
thus
he
live
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
very
bad
time
for
this
diversion
while
thing
be
as
I
have
tell
,
yet
the
poor
fellow
go
about
as
usual
,
but
be
almost
starve
;
and
when
anybody
ask
how
he
do
he
would
answer
,
the
dead
cart
have
not
take
him
yet
,
but
that
they
have
promise
to
call
for
him
next
week
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
one
night
that
this
poor
fellow
,
whether
somebody
have
give
him
too
much
drink
or
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
John
Hayward
say
he
have
not
drink
in
his
house
,
but
that
they
have
give
him
a
little
more
victual
than
ordinary
at
a
public
-
house
in
Coleman
Street
 
and
the
poor
fellow
,
have
not
usually
have
a
bellyful
for
perhaps
<EOS>
not
a
good
while
,
be
lay
all
along
upon
the
top
of
a
bulk
or
stall
,
and
fast
asleep
,
at
a
door
in
the
street
near
London
Wall
,
towards
Cripplegate-
,
and
that
upon
the
same
bulk
or
stall
the
people
of
some
house
,
in
the
alley
of
which
the
house
be
a
corner
,
hear
a
bell
which
they
always
ring
before
the
cart
come
,
have
lay
a
body
really
dead
of
the
plague
just
by
him
,
think
,
too
,
that
this
poor
fellow
have
be
a
dead
body
,
as
the
other
be
,
and
lay
there
by
some
of
the
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
John
Hayward
with
his
bell
and
the
cart
come
along
,
find
two
dead
body
lie
upon
the
stall
,
they
take
them
up
with
the
instrument
they
use
and
throw
them
into
the
cart
,
and
,
all
this
while
the
piper
sleep
soundly
.
  
<EOS>
from
hence
they
pass
along
and
take
in
other
dead
body
,
till
,
<EOS>
as
honest
John
Hayward
tell
me
,
they
almost
bury
him
alive
in
the
cart
;
yet
all
this
while
he
sleep
soundly
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
cart
come
to
the
place
where
the
body
be
to
be
throw
into
the
ground
,
which
,
as
I
do
remember
,
be
at
Mount
Mill
;
and
as
the
cart
usually
stop
some
time
before
they
be
ready
to
shoot
out
the
melancholy
load
they
have
in
it
,
as
soon
as
the
cart
stop
the
fellow
awake
and
struggle
a
little
to
get
his
head
out
from
among
the
dead
body
,
when
,
raise
himself
up
in
the
cart
,
he
call
out
,
"
<EOS>
hey
!
where
be
I
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
fright
the
fellow
that
attend
about
the
work
;
but
after
some
pause
John
Hayward
,
recover
himself
,
say
,
"
Lord
,
bless
us
!
<EOS>
there
be
somebody
in
the
cart
not
quite
dead
!
"
<EOS>
so
another
call
to
him
and
say
,
"
who
be
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fellow
answer
,
"
I
be
the
poor
piper
.
<EOS>
where
be
I
?
"
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
?
"
say
Hayward
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
be
in
the
dead
-
cart
,
and
we
be
go
to
bury
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
I
an't
dead
though
,
be
I
?
"
say
the
piper
,
which
make
them
laugh
a
little
though
,
as
John
say
,
they
be
heartily
fright
at
first
;
so
they
help
the
poor
fellow
down
,
and
he
go
about
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
the
story
go
he
set
up
his
pipe
in
the
cart
and
fright
the
bearer
and
other
so
that
they
run
away
;
but
John
Hayward
do
not
tell
the
story
so
,
nor
say
anything
of
his
piping
at
all
;
but
that
he
be
a
poor
piper
,
and
that
he
be
carry
away
as
above
<EOS>
I
be
fully
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
note
here
that
the
dead
-
cart
in
the
city
be
not
confine
to
particular
parish
,
but
one
cart
go
through
several
parish
,
accord
as
the
number
of
dead
present
;
nor
be
they
tie
to
carry
the
dead
to
their
respective
parish
,
but
many
of
the
dead
take
up
in
the
city
be
carry
to
the
burying
-
ground
in
the
out
-
part
for
want
of
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
already
mention
the
surprise
that
this
judgement
be
at
first
among
the
people
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
allow
to
give
some
of
my
observation
on
the
more
serious
and
religious
part
.
<EOS>
surely
never
city
,
at
least
of
this
bulk
and
magnitude
,
be
take
in
a
condition
so
perfectly
unprepared
for
such
a
dreadful
visitation
,
whether
I
be
to
speak
of
the
civil
preparation
or
religious
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
indeed
,
as
if
they
have
have
no
warning
,
no
expectation
,
no
apprehension
,
and
consequently
the
least
provision
imaginable
be
make
for
it
in
a
public
way
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
the
Lord
Mayor
and
sheriff
have
make
no
provision
as
magistrate
for
the
regulation
which
be
to
be
observe
.
<EOS>
They
have
go
into
no
measure
for
relief
of
the
poor
.
<EOS>
the
citizen
have
no
public
magazine
or
storehouse
for
corn
or
meal
for
the
subsistence
of
the
poor
,
which
if
they
have
provide
themselves
,
as
in
such
case
be
do
abroad
,
many
miserable
family
who
be
now
reduce
to
the
utmost
distress
would
have
be
relieve
,
and
that
in
a
well
manner
than
now
could
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
stock
of
the
city
's
money
I
can
say
but
little
to
.
<EOS>
the
Chamber
of
London
be
say
to
be
exceedingly
rich
,
and
it
may
be
conclude
that
they
be
so
,
by
the
vast
of
money
issue
from
thence
in
the
rebuilding
the
public
edifice
after
the
fire
of
London
,
and
in
build
new
work
,
such
as
,
for
the
first
part
,
the
Guildhall
,
Blackwell
Hall
,
part
of
Leadenhall
,
half
the
Exchange
,
the
Session
House
,
the
Compter
,
the
prison
of
Ludgate
,
Newgate
,
&
c.
,
several
of
the
wharf
and
stair
and
landing
-
place
on
the
river
;
all
which
be
either
burn
down
or
damage
by
the
great
fire
of
London
,
the
next
year
after
the
plague
;
and
of
the
second
sort
,
the
Monument
,
Fleet
Ditch
with
its
bridge
,
and
the
Hospital
of
Bethlem
or
Bedlam
,
&
c.
<EOS>
but
possibly
the
manager
of
the
city
's
credit
at
that
time
make
more
conscience
of
break
in
upon
the
orphan
's
money
to
show
charity
to
the
distressed
citizen
than
the
manager
in
the
follow
year
do
to
beautify
the
city
and
re
-
edify
the
building
;
though
,
in
the
first
case
,
the
loser
would
have
think
their
fortune
better
bestow
,
and
the
public
faith
of
the
city
have
be
less
subject
to
scandal
and
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledge
that
the
absent
citizen
,
who
,
though
they
be
flee
for
safety
into
the
country
,
be
yet
greatly
interested
in
the
welfare
of
those
whom
they
leave
behind
,
forget
not
to
contribute
liberally
to
the
relief
of
the
poor
,
and
large
sum
be
also
collect
among
trade
town
in
the
remote
part
of
England
;
and
,
as
I
have
hear
also
,
the
nobility
and
the
gentry
in
all
part
of
England
take
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
city
into
their
consideration
,
and
send
up
large
sum
of
money
in
charity
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
magistrate
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
.
<EOS>
the
king
also
,
as
I
be
tell
,
order
a
thousand
pound
a
week
to
be
distribute
in
four
part
:
one
quarter
to
the
city
and
liberty
of
Westminster
;
one
quarter
or
part
among
the
inhabitant
of
the
Southwark
side
of
the
water
;
one
quarter
to
the
liberty
and
part
within
of
the
city
,
exclusive
of
the
city
within
the
wall
;
and
one
-
fourth
part
to
the
suburb
in
the
county
of
Middlesex
,
and
the
east
and
north
part
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
but
this
latter
I
only
speak
of
as
a
report
.
  
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
the
great
part
of
the
poor
or
family
who
formerly
live
by
their
labour
,
or
by
retail
trade
,
live
now
on
charity
;
and
have
there
not
be
prodigious
sum
of
money
give
by
charitable
,
well
-
minded
Christians
for
the
support
of
such
,
the
city
could
never
have
subsist
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
no
question
,
account
keep
of
their
charity
,
and
of
the
just
distribution
of
it
by
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
but
as
such
multitude
of
those
very
officer
die
through
whose
hand
it
be
distribute
,
and
also
that
,
as
I
have
be
tell
,
most
of
the
account
of
those
thing
be
lose
in
the
great
fire
which
happen
in
the
very
next
year
,
and
which
burn
even
the
chamberlain
's
office
and
many
of
their
paper
,
so
I
could
never
come
at
the
particular
account
,
which
I
use
great
endeavour
to
have
see
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
,
however
,
be
a
direction
in
case
of
the
approach
of
a
like
visitation
,
which
God
keep
the
city
from
;
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
it
may
be
of
use
to
observe
that
by
the
care
of
the
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
at
that
time
in
distribute
weekly
great
sum
of
money
for
relief
of
the
poor
,
a
multitude
of
people
who
would
otherwise
have
perish
,
be
relieve
,
and
their
life
preserve
.
<EOS>
and
here
let
me
enter
into
a
brief
state
of
the
case
of
the
poor
at
that
time
,
and
what
way
apprehend
from
them
,
from
whence
may
be
judge
hereafter
what
may
be
expect
if
the
like
distress
should
come
upon
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
beginning
of
the
plague
,
when
there
be
now
no
more
hope
but
that
the
whole
city
would
be
visit
;
when
,
as
I
have
say
,
all
that
have
friend
or
estate
in
the
country
retire
with
their
family
;
and
when
,
indeed
,
one
would
have
think
the
very
city
itself
be
run
out
of
the
gate
,
and
that
there
would
be
nobody
leave
behind
;
you
may
be
sure
from
that
hour
all
trade
,
except
such
as
relate
to
immediate
subsistence
,
be
,
as
it
be
,
at
a
full
stop
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
so
lively
a
case
,
and
contain
in
it
so
much
of
the
real
condition
of
the
people
,
that
I
think
I
can
not
be
too
particular
in
it
,
and
therefore
I
descend
to
the
several
arrangement
or
class
of
people
who
fall
into
immediate
distress
upon
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
for
example
:
  
1
.
<EOS>
all
master
-
workman
in
manufacture
,
especially
such
as
belong
to
ornament
and
the
less
necessary
part
of
the
people
's
dress
,
clothe
,
and
furniture
for
house
,
such
as
riband
-
weaver
and
other
weaver
,
gold
and
silver
lace
maker
,
and
gold
and
silver
wire
drawer
,
sempstress
,
milliner
,
shoemaker
,
hatmaker
,
and
glovemaker
;
also
upholsterer
,
joiner
,
cabinet
-
maker
,
looking
-
glass
maker
,
and
innumerable
trade
which
depend
upon
such
as
these
;
 
I
say
,
the
master
-
workman
in
such
stop
their
work
,
dismiss
their
journeyman
and
workman
,
and
all
their
dependent
.
  
<EOS>

.
<EOS>
as
merchandising
be
at
a
full
stop
,
for
very
few
ship
venture
to
come
up
the
river
and
none
at
all
go
out
,
so
all
the
extraordinary
officer
of
the
custom
,
likewise
the
waterman
,
carman
,
porter
,
and
all
the
poor
whose
labour
depend
upon
the
merchant
,
be
at
once
dismiss
and
put
out
of
business
.
  
<EOS>
3
.
<EOS>
all
the
tradesman
usually
employ
in
building
or
repairing
of
house
be
at
a
full
stop
,
for
the
people
be
far
from
want
to
build
house
<EOS>
when
so
many
thousand
house
be
at
once
strip
of
their
inhabitant
;
so
that
this
one
article
turn
all
the
ordinary
workman
of
that
kind
out
of
business
,
such
as
bricklayer
,
mason
,
carpenter
,
joiner
,
plasterer
,
painter
,
glazier
,
smith
,
plumber
,
and
all
the
labourer
depend
on
such
.

.
<EOS>
as
navigation
be
at
a
stop
,
our
ship
neither
come
in
or
go
out
as
before
,
so
the
seaman
be
all
out
of
employment
,
and
many
of
them
in
the
last
and
low
degree
of

<EOS>
all

retrench
their
living
as
much
as
possible

as
well
those

an
innumerable

be
turn
off
,
and
leave
friendless
and
helpless
,
without
employment
and
without
habitation
,
and
this
be
really
a
dismal
article
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
be
more
particular
as
to
this
part
,
but
it
may
suffice
to
mention
in
general
,
all
trade
be
stop
,
employment
cease
:
<EOS>
the
labour
,
and
by
that
the
bread
,
of
the
poor
be
cut
off
;
and
at
first
indeed
the
cry
of
the
poor
be
most
lamentable
to
hear
,
though
by
the
distribution
of
charity
their
misery
that
way
be
greatly
abate
.
<EOS>
many
indeed
flee
into
the
county
,
but
thousand
of
them
have
stay
in
London
till
nothing
but
desperation
send
them
away
,
death
overtook
them
on
the
road
,
and
they
serve
for
no
well
than
the
messenger
of
death
;
indeed
,
other
carry
the
infection
along
with
them
,
spread
it
very
unhappily
into
the
remote
part
of
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
many
of
these
be
the
miserable
object
of
despair
which
I
have
mention
before
,
and
be
remove
by
the
destruction
which
follow
.
<EOS>
these
may
be
say
to
perish
not
by
the
infection
itself
but
by
the
consequence
of
it
;
indeed
,
namely
,
by
hunger
and
distress
and
the
want
of
all
thing
:
be
without
lodge
,
without
money
,
without
friend
,
without
mean
to
get
their
bread
,
or
without
anyone
to
give
it
them
;
for
many
of
them
be
without
what
we
call
legal
settlement
,
and
so
could
not
claim
of
the
parish
,
and
all
the
support
they
have
be
by
application
to
the
magistrate
for
relief
,
which
relief
be
(
to
give
the
magistrate
their
due
)
carefully
and
cheerfully
administer
as
they
find
it
necessary
,
and
those
that
stay
behind
never
feel
the
want
and
distress
of
that
kind
which
they
feel
who
go
away
in
the
manner
above
note
.
  
<EOS>
let
any
one
who
be
acquaint
with
what
multitude
of
people
get
their
daily
bread
in
this
city
by
their
labour
,
whether
artificer
or
mere
workman
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
let
any
man
consider
what
must
be
the
miserable
condition
of
this
town
if
,
on
a
sudden
,
they
should
be
all
turn
out
of
employment
,
that
labour
should
cease
,
and
wage
for
work
be
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
with
us
at
that
time
;
and
have
not
the
sum
of
money
contribute
in
charity
by
well
-
dispose
people
of
every
kind
,
as
well
abroad
as
at
home
,
be
prodigiously
great
,
it
have
not
be
in
the
power
of
the
Lord
Mayor
and
sheriff
to
have
keep
the
public
peace
.
<EOS>
nor
be
they
without
apprehension
,
as
it
be
,
that
desperation
should
push
the
people
upon
tumult
,
and
cause
them
to
rifle
the
house
of
rich
man
and
plunder
the
market
of
provision
;
in
which
case
the
country
people
,
who
bring
provision
very
freely
and
boldly
to
town
,
would
have
be
terrify
from
come
any
more
,
and
the
town
would
have
sink
under
an
unavoidable
famine
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
prudence
of
my
Lord
Mayor
and
the
Court
of
Aldermen
within
the
city
,
and
of
the
justice
of
peace
in
the
out
-
part
,
be
such
,
and
they
be
support
with
money
from
all
part
so
well
,
that
the
poor
people
be
keep
quiet
,
and
their
want
everywhere
relieve
,
as
far
as
be
possible
to
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
two
thing
besides
this
contribute
to
prevent
the
mob
do
any
mischief
.
<EOS>
one
be
,
that
really
the
rich
themselves
have
not
lay
up
store
of
provision
in
their
house
as
indeed
they
ought
to
have
do
,
and
which
if
they
have
be
wise
enough
to
have
do
,
and
lock
themselves
entirely
up
,
as
some
few
do
,
they
have
perhaps
escape
the
disease
better
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
appear
they
have
not
,
so
the
mob
have
no
notion
of
find
store
of
provision
there
if
they
have
break
in
as
it
be
plain
they
be
sometimes
very
near
do
,
and
which
:
if
they
bad
,
they
have
finish
the
ruin
of
the
whole
city
,
for
there
be
no
regular
troop
to
have
withstand
them
,
nor
could
the
train
band
have
be
bring
together
to
defend
the
city
,
no
man
be
to
be
find
to
bear
arm
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
vigilance
of
the
Lord
Mayor
and
such
magistrate
as
could
be
have
(
for
some
,
even
of
the
alderman
,
be
dead
,
and
some
absent
)
prevent
this
;
and
they
do
it
by
the
most
kind
and
gentle
method
they
could
think
of
,
as
particularly
by
relieve
the
most
desperate
with
money
,
and
put
other
into
business
,
and
particularly
that
employment
of
watch
house
that
be
infect
and
shut
up
.
<EOS>
and
as
the
number
of
these
be
very
great
(
for
it
be
say
there
be
at
one
time
ten
thousand
house
shut
up
,
and
every
house
have
two
watchman
to
guard
it
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
one
by
night
and
the
other
by
day
)
,
this
give
opportunity
to
employ
a
very
great
number
of
poor
man
at
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
and
servant
that
be
turn
off
from
their
place
be
likewise
employ
as
nurse
to
tend
the
sick
in
all
place
,
and
this
take
off
a
very
great
number
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
which
though
a
melancholy
article
in
itself
,
yet
be
a
deliverance
in
its
kind
:
namely
,
the
plague
,
which
rage
in
a
dreadful
manner
from
the
middle
of
August
to
the
middle
of
October
,
carry
off
in
that
time
thirty
or
forty
thousand
of
these
very
people
which
,
have
they
be
leave
,
would
certainly
have
be
an
insufferable
burden
by
their
poverty
<EOS>
;
that
be
to
say
,
the
whole
city
could
not
have
support
the
expense
of
them
,
or
have
provide
food
for
them
;
and
they
would
in
time
have
be
even
drive
to
the
necessity
of
plunder
either
the
city
itself
or
the
country
adjacent
,
to
have
subsist
themselves
,
which
would
first
or
last
have
put
the
whole
nation
,
as
well
as
the
city
,
into
the
utmost
terror
and
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
observable
,
then
,
that
this
calamity
of
the
people
make
them
very
humble
;
for
now
for
about
nine
week
together
there
die
near
a
thousand
a
day
,
one
day
with
another
,
even
by
the
account
of
the
weekly
bill
,
which
yet
,
I
have
reason
to
be
assure
,
never
give
a
full
account
,
by
many
thousand
;
the
confusion
be
such
,
and
the
cart
work
in
the
dark
when
they
carry
the
dead
,
that
in
some
place
no
account
at
all
be
keep
,
but
they
work
on
,
the
clerk
and
sexton
not
attend
for
week
together
,
and
not
know
what
number
they
carry
.
<EOS>
this
account

so
that
the
gross
of
the
people
be
carry
off
in
these
two
month
;
for
,
as
the
whole
number
which
be
bring
in
to
die
of
the
plague
be
but
68,590
<EOS>
,
here
be
50,000
of
them
,
within
a
trifle
,
in
two
month
;
I
say
50,000
,
because
,
as
there
want
295
in
the
number
above
,
so
there
want
two
day
of
two
month
in
the
account
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
now
when
I
say
that
the
parish
officer
do
not
give
in
a
full
account
,
or
be
not
to
be
depend
upon
for
their
account
,
let
any
one
but
consider
how
man
could
be
exact
in
such
a
time
of
dreadful
distress
,
and
when
many
of
them
be
take
sick
themselves
and
perhaps
die
in
the
very
time
when
their
account
be
to
be
give
in
<EOS>
;
I
mean
the
parish
clerk
,
besides
inferior
officer
;
for
though
these
poor
man
venture
at
all
hazard
,
yet
they
be
far
from
be
exempt
from
the
common
calamity
,
especially
if
it
be
true
that
the
parish
of
Stepney
have
,
within
the
year
,
116
sexton
,
gravedigger
,
and
their
assistant
;
that
be
to
say
,
bearer
,
bellman
,
and
driver
of
cart
for
carry
off
the
dead
body
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
the
work
be
not
of
a
nature
to
allow
them
leisure
to
take
an
exact
tale
of
the
dead
body
,
which
be
all
huddle
together
in
the
dark
into
a
pit
;
which
pit
or
trench
no
man
could
come
nigh
but
at
the
utmost
peril
.
<EOS>
I
observe
often
that
in
the
parish
of
Aldgate
and
Cripplegate
,
Whitechappel
and
Stepney
,
there
be
five
,
six
,
seven
,
and
eight
hundred
in
a
week
in
the
bill
;
whereas
if
we
may
believe
the
opinion
of
those
that
live
in
the
city
all
the
time
as
well
as
I
,
there
die
sometimes
2000
a
week
in
those
parish
;
and
I
see
it
under
the
hand
of
one
that
make
as
strict
an
examination
into
that
part
as
he
could
,
that
there
really
die
an
hundred
thousand
people
of
the
plague
in
that
one
year
whereas
in
the
bill
,
the
article
of
the
plague
,
it
be
but
68,590
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
may
be
allow
to
give
my
opinion
,
by
what
I
see
with
my
eye
and
hear
from
other
people
that
be
eye
-
witness
,
I
do
verily
believe
the
same
,
viz
.
,
that
there
die
at
least
100,000
of
the
plague
only
,
besides
other
distemper
and
besides
those
which
die
in
the
field
and
highway
and
secret
place
out
of
the
compass
of
the
communication
,
as
it
be
call
,
and
who
be
not
put
down
in
the
bill
though
they
really
belong
to
the
body
of
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
It
be
know
to
us
all
that
abundance
of
poor
despairing
creature
who
have
the
distemper
upon
them
,
and
be
grow
stupid
or
melancholy
by
their
misery
,
as
many
be
,
wander
away
into
the
field
and
Woods
,
and
into
secret
uncouth
place
almost
anywhere
,
to
creep
into
a
bush
or
hedge
and
die
.
  
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
the
village
adjacent
would
,
in
pity
,
carry
them
food
and
set
it
at
a
distance
,
that
they
may
fetch
it
,
if
they
be
able
;
and
sometimes
they
be
not
able
,
and
the
next
time
they
go
they
should
find
the
poor
wretch
lie
dead
and
the
food
untouched
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
these
miserable
object
be
many
,
and
I
know
so
many
that
perish
thus
,
and
so
exactly
where
,
that
I
believe
I
could
go
to
the
very
place
and
dig
their
bone
up
still
;
for
the
country
people
would
go
and
dig
a
hole
at
a
distance
from
them
,
and
then
with
long
pole
,
and
hook
at
the
end
of
them
,
drag
the
body
into
these
pit
,
and
then
throw
the
earth
in
from
as
far
as
they
could
cast
it
,
to
cover
them
,
take
notice
how
the
wind
blow
,
and
so
come
on
that
side
which
the
seaman
call
to
windward
,
that
the
scent
of
the
body
may
blow
from
them
;
and
thus
great
number
go
out
of
the
world
who
be
never
know
,
or
any
account
of
them
take
,
as
well
within
the
bill
of
mortality
as
without
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
I
have
in
the
main
only
from
the
relation
of
other
,
for
I
seldom
walk
into
the
field
,
except
towards
Bethnal
Green
and
Hackney
,
or
as
hereafter
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
do
walk
,
I
always
see
a
great
many
poor
wanderer
at
a
distance
;
but
I
could
know
little
of
their
case
,
for
whether
it
be
in
the
street
or
in
the
field
,
if
we
have
see
anybody
come
,
it
be
a
general
method
to
walk
away
;
yet
I
believe
the
account
be
exactly
true
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
put
me
upon
mention
my
walk
the
street
and
field
,
I
can
not
omit
take
notice
what
a
desolate
place
the
city
be
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
the
great
street
I
live
in
(
which
be
know
to
be
one
of
the
broad
of
all
the
street
of
London
,
I
mean
of
the
suburb
as
well
as
the
liberty
)
all
the
side
where
the
butcher
live
,
especially
without
the
bar
,
be
more
like
a
green
field
than
a
paved
street
,
and
the
people
generally
go
in
the
middle
with
the
horse
and
cart
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
the
farth
end
towards
Whitechappel
Church
be
not
all
pave
,
but
even
the
part
that
be
pave
be
full
of
grass
also
;
but
this
nee
not
seem
strange
,
since
the
great
street
within
the
city
,
such
as
Leadenhall
Street
,
Bishopsgate
Street
,
Cornhill
,
and
even
the
Exchange
itself
,
have
grass
grow
in
them
in
several
place
;
neither
cart
or
coach
be
see
in
the
street
from
morning
to
evening
,
except
some
country
cart
to
bring
root
and
bean
,
or
pea
,
hay
,
and
straw
,
to
the
market
,
and
those
but
very
few
compare
to
what
be
usual
.
<EOS>
as
for
coach
,
they
be
scarce
use
but
to
carry
sick
people
to
the
pest
-
house
,
and
to
other
hospital
,
and
some
few
to
carry
physician
to
such
place
as
they
think
fit
to
venture
to
visit
;
for
really
coach
be
dangerous
thing
,
and
people
do
not
care
to
venture
into
them
,
because
they
do
not
know
who
may
have
be
carry
in
them
last
,
and
sick
,
infected
people
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
ordinarily
carry
in
them
to
the
pest
-
house
,
and
sometimes
people
expire
in
them
as
they
go
along
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
when
the
infection
come
to
such
a
height
as
I
have
now
mention
,
there
be
very
few
physician
which
care
to
stir
abroad
to
sick
house
,
and
very
many
of
the
most
eminent
of
the
faculty
be
dead
,
as
well
as
the
surgeon
also
;
for
now
it
be
indeed
a
dismal
time
,
and
for
about
a
month
together
,
not
take
any
notice
of
the
bill
of
mortality
,
I
believe
there
do
not
die
less
than
1500
or
1700
a
day
,
one
day
with
another
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
bad
day
we
have
in
the
whole
time
,
as
I
think
,
be
in
the
beginning
of
September
,
when
,
indeed
,
good
people
begin
to
think
that
God
be
resolve
to
make
a
full
end
of
the
people
in
this
miserable
city
.
<EOS>
this
be
at
that
time
when
the
plague
be
fully
come
into
the
eastern
parish
.
<EOS>
the
parish
of
Aldgate
,
if
I
may
give
my
opinion
,
bury
above
a
thousand
a
week
for
two
week
,
though
the
bill
do
not
say
so
many
;
 
but
<EOS>
it
surround
me
at
so
dismal
a
rate
that
there
be
not
a
house
in
twenty
uninfected
in
the
Minories
,
in
Houndsditch
,
and
in
those
part
of
Aldgate
parish
about
the
Butcher
Row
and
the
alley
over
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
in
those
place
death
reign
in
every
corner
.
<EOS>
Whitechappel
parish
be
in
the
same
condition
,
and
though
much
less
than
the
parish
I
live
in
,
yet
bury
near
600
a
week
by
the
bill
,
and
in
my
opinion
near
twice
as
many
.
<EOS>
whole
family
,
and
indeed
whole
street
of
family
,
be
sweep
away
together
;
insomuch
that
it
be
frequent
for
neighbour
to
call
to
the
bellman
to
go
to
such
-
and
-
such
house
and
fetch
out
the
people
,
for
that
they
be
all
dead
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
the
work
of
remove
the
dead
body
by
cart
be
now
grow
so
very
odious
and
dangerous
that
it
be
complain
of
that
the
bearer
do
not
take
care
to
dear
such
house
where
all
the
inhabitant
be
dead
,
but
that
sometimes
the
body
lie
several
day
unburie
,
till
the
neighbouring
family
be
offend
with
the
stench
,
and
consequently
infect
;
and
this
neglect
of
the
officer
be
such
that
the
churchwarden
and
constable
be
summon
to
look
after
it
,
and
even
the
justice
of
the
Hamlets
be
oblige
to
venture
their
life
among
them
to
quicken
and
encourage
them
,
for
innumerable
of
the
bearer
die
of
the
distemper
,
infect
by
the
body
they
be
oblige
to
come
so
near
.
<EOS>
and
have
it
not
be
that
the
number
of
poor
people
who
want
employment
and
want
bread
(
as
I
have
say
before
)
be
so
great
that
necessity
drive
them
to
undertake
anything
and
venture
anything
<EOS>
,
they
would
never
have
find
people
to
be
employ
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
body
of
the
dead
would
have
lie
above
ground
,
and
have
perish
and
rot
in
a
dreadful
manner
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
magistrate
can
not
be
enough
commend
in
this
<EOS>
,
that
they
keep
such
good
order
for
the
burying
of
the
dead
,
that
as
fast
as
any
of
these
they
employ
to
carry
off
and
bury
the
dead
fall
sick
or
die
,
as
be
many
time
the
case
,
they
immediately
supply
the
place
with
other
,
which
,
by
reason
of
the
great
number
of
poor
that
be
leave
out
of
business
,
as
above
,
be
not
hard
to
do
.
<EOS>
this
occasion
,
that
notwithstanding
the
infinite
number
of
people
which
die
and
be
sick
,
almost
all
together
,
yet
they
be
always
clear
away
and
carry
off
every
night
,
so
that
it
be
never
to
be
say
of
London
that
the
living
be
not
able
to
bury
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
desolation
be
great
during
those
terrible
time
,
so
the
amazement
of
the
people
increase
,
and
a
thousand
unaccountable
thing
they
would
do
in
the
violence
of
their
fright
,
as
other
do
the
same
in
the
agony
of
their
distemper
,
and
this
part
be
very
affecting
.
<EOS>
some
go
roar
and
crying
and
wring
their
hand
along
the
street
;
some
would
go
pray
and
lift
up
their
hand
to
heaven
,
call
upon
God
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
indeed
,
whether
this
be
not
in
their
distraction
,
but
,
be
it
so
,
it
be
still
an
indication
of
a
more
serious
mind
,
when
they
have
the
use
of
their
sense
,
and
be
much
well
,
even
as
it
be
,
than
the
frightful
yelling
and
cry
that
every
day
,
and
especially
in
the
evening
,
be
hear
in
some
street
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
world
have
hear
of
the
famous
Solomon
Eagle
,
an
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
He
,
though
not
infect
at
all
but
in
his
head
,
go
about
denouncing
of
judgement
upon
the
city
in
a
frightful
manner
,
sometimes
quite
naked
,
and
with
a
pan
of
burn
charcoal
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
what
he
say
,
or
pretend
,
indeed
I
could
not
learn
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
whether
that
clergyman
be
distract
or
not
,
or
whether
he
do
it
in
pure
zeal
for
the
poor
people
,
who
go
every
evening
through
the
street
of
Whitechappel
,
and
,
with
his
hand
lift
up
,
repeat
that
part
of
the
Liturgy
of
the
Church
continually
,
"
spare
us
,
good
Lord
;
spare
Thy
people
,
whom
Thou
have
redeem
with
Thy
most
precious
blood
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
I
can
not
speak
positively
of
these
thing
,
because
these
be
only
the
dismal
object
which
represent
themselves
to
me
as
I
look
through
my
chamber
window
(
for
I
seldom
open
the
casement
)
,
while
I
confine
myself
within
door
during
that
most
violent
raging
of
the
pestilence
;
when
,
indeed
,
as
I
have
say
,
many
begin
to
think
,
and
even
to
say
,
that
there
would
none
escape
;
and
indeed
I
begin
to
think
so
too
,
and
therefore
keep
within
door
for
about
a
fortnight
and
never
stir
out
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
hold
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
some
people
who
,
notwithstanding
the
danger
,
do
not
omit
publicly
to
attend
the
worship
of
God
,
even
in
the
most
dangerous
time
;
and
though
it
be
true
that
a
great
many
clergyman
do
shut
up
their
church
,
and
flee
,
as
other
people
do
,
for
the
safety
of
their
life
,
yet
all
do
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
some
venture
to
officiate
and
to
keep
up
the
assembly
of
the
people
by
constant
prayer
,
and
sometimes
sermon
or
brief
exhortation
to
repentance
and
reformation
,
and
this
as
long
as
any
would
come
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
and
Dissenters
do
the
like
also
,
and
even
in
the
very
church
where
the
parish
minister
be
either
dead
or
flee
;
nor
be
there
any
room
for
make
difference
at
such
a
time
as
this
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
lamentable
thing
to
hear
the
miserable
lamentation
of
poor
dying
creature
call
out
for
minister
to
comfort
them
and
pray
with
them
,
to
counsel
them
and
to
direct
them
,
call
out
to
God
for
pardon
and
mercy
,
and
confess
aloud
their
past
sin
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
the
stout
heart
bleed
to
hear
how
many
warning
be
then
give
by
die
penitent
to
other
not
to
put
off
and
delay
their
repentance
to
the
day
of
distress
;
that
such
a
time
of
calamity
as
this
be
no
time
for
repentance
,
be
no
time
to
call
upon
God
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
repeat
the
very
sound
of
those
groan
and
of
those
exclamation
that
I
hear
from
some
poor
die
creature
when
in
the
height
of
their
agony
and
distress
,
and
that
I
could
make
him
that
read
this
hear
,
as
I
imagine
I
now
hear
them
,
for
the
sound
seem
still
to
ring
in
my
ear
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
tell
this
part
in
such
move
accent
as
should
alarm
the
very
soul
of
the
reader
,
I
should
rejoice
that
I
record
those
thing
,
however
short
and
imperfect
.
  
<EOS>
It
please
God
that
I
be
still
spare
,
and
very
hearty
and
sound
in
health
,
but
very
impatient
of
be
pen
up
within
door
without
air
,
as
I
have
be
for
fourteen
day
or
thereabout
;
and
I
could
not
restrain
myself
,
but
I
would
go
to
carry
a
letter
for
my
brother
to
the
post
-
house
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
indeed
that
I
observe
a
profound
silence
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
the
post
-
house
,
as
I
go
to
put
in
my
letter
<EOS>
I
see
a
man
stand
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
and
talk
to
another
at
a
window
,
and
a
third
have
open
a
door
belong
to
the
office
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
lie
a
small
leather
purse
with
two
key
hang
at
it
,
with
money
in
it
,
but
nobody
would
meddle
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
ask
how
long
it
have
lain
there
;
the
man
at
the
window
say
it
have
lie
almost
an
hour
,
but
that
they
have
not
meddle
with
it
,
because
they
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
the
person
who
drop
it
may
come
back
to
look
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
need
of
money
,
nor
be
the
sum
so
big
that
I
have
any
inclination
to
meddle
with
it
,
or
to
get
the
money
at
the
hazard
it
may
be
attend
with
;
so
I
seem
to
go
away
,
when
the
man
who
have
open
the
door
say
he
would
take
it
up
,
but
so
that
if
the
right
owner
come
for
it
he
should
be
sure
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
so
he
go
in
and
fetch
a
pail
of
water
and
set
it
down
hard
by
the
purse
,
then
go
again
and
fetch
some
gunpowder
,
and
cast
a
good
deal
of
powder
upon
the
purse
,
and
then
make
a
train
from
that
which
he
have
throw
loose
upon
the
purse
.
<EOS>
the
train
reach
about
two
yard
.
<EOS>
after
this
he
go
in
a
third
time
and
fetch
out
a
pair
of
tong
red
hot
,
and
which
he
have
prepare
,
I
suppose
,
on
purpose
;
and
first
set
fire
to
the
train
of
powder
,
that
singe
the
purse
and
also
smoke
the
air
sufficiently
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
content
with
that
,
but
he
then
take
up
the
purse
with
the
tong
,
hold
it
so
long
till
the
tong
burn
through
the
purse
,
and
then
he
shake
the
money
out
into
the
pail
of
water
,
so
he
carry
it
in
.
<EOS>
the
money
,
as
I
remember
,
be
about
thirteen
shill
and
some
smooth
groat
and
brass
farthing
.
  
<EOS>
there
may
perhaps
have
be
several
poor
people
,
as
I
have
observe
above
,
that
would
have
be
hardy
enough
to
have
venture
for
the
sake
of
the
money
;
but
you
may
easily
see
by
what
I
have
observe
that
the
few
people
who
be
spare
be
very
careful
of
themselves
at
that
time
when
the
distress
be
so
exceed
great
.
  
<EOS>
much
about
the
same
time
I
walk
out
into
the
field
towards
Bow
;
for
I
have
a
great
mind
to
see
how
thing
be
manage
in
the
river
and
among
the
ship
;
and
as
I
have
some
concern
in
shipping
,
I
have
a
notion
that
it
have
be
one
of
the
good
way
of
secure
one
's
self
from
the
infection
to
have
retire
into
a
ship
;
and
muse
how
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
in
that
point
<EOS>
,
I
turn
away
over
the
field
from
Bow
to
Bromley
,
and
down
to
Blackwall
to
the
stair
which
be
there
for
land
or
take
water
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
see
a
poor
man
walk
on
the
bank
,
or
sea
-
wall
,
as
they
call
it
,
by
himself
.
<EOS>
I
walk
a
while
also
about
,
see
the
house
all
shut
up
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
fall
into
some
talk
,
at
a
distance
,
with
this
poor
man
;
first
I
ask
him
how
people
do
thereabout
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
alas
,
sir
!
"
say
he
,
"
almost
desolate
;
all
dead
or
sick
.
<EOS>
here
be
very
few
family
in
this
part
,
or
in
that
village
"
<EOS>
(
point
at
Poplar
)
,
"
where
half
of
them
be
not
dead
already
,
and
the
rest
sick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
point
to
one
house
,
"
there
they
be
all
dead
"
,
say
he
,
"
and
the
house
stand
open
;
nobody
dare
go
into
it
.
<EOS>
a
poor
thief
"
,
say
he
,
"
venture
in
to
steal
something
,
but
he
pay
dear
for
his
theft
,
for
he
be
carry
to
the
churchyard
too
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
point
to
several
other
house
.
<EOS>
"
there
"
,
say
he
,
"
they
be
all
dead
,
the
man
and
his
wife
,
and
five
child
.
<EOS>
there
"
,
say
he
,
"
they
be
shut
up
;
you
see
a
watchman
at
the
door
"
;
and
so
of
other
house
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
do
you
here
all
alone
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
a
poor
,
desolate
man
;
it
have
please
God
I
be
not
yet
visit
,
though
my
family
be
,
and
one
of
my
child
dead
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
mean
,
then
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
you
be
not
visit
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
be
my
house
"
(
point
to
a
very
little
,
low
-
board
house
)
,
"
and
there
my
poor
wife
and
two
child
live
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
they
may
be
say
to
live
,
for
my
wife
and
one
of
the
child
be
visit
,
but
I
do
not
come
at
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
that
word
I
see
the
tear
run
very
plentifully
down
his
face
;
and
so
they
do
down
mine
too
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
I
,
"
why
do
you
not
come
at
them
?
<EOS>
how
can
you
abandon
your
own
flesh
and
blood
?
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
Lord
forbid
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
abandon
them
;
I
work
for
them
as
much
as
I
be
able
;
and
,
bless
be
the
Lord
,
I
keep
them
from
want
"
;
and
with
that
I
observe
he
lift
up
his
eye
to
heaven
,
with
a
countenance
that
presently
tell
me
I
have
happen
on
a
man
that
be
no
hypocrite
,
but
a
serious
,
religious
,
good
man
,
and
his
ejaculation
be
an
expression
of
thankfulness
that
,
in
such
a
condition
as
he
be
in
,
he
should
be
able
to
say
his
family
do
not
want
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
honest
man
<EOS>
,
that
be
a
great
mercy
as
thing
go
now
with
the
poor
.
<EOS>
but
how
do
you
live
,
then
,
and
how
be
you
keep
from
the
dreadful
calamity
that
be
now
upon
us
all
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
a
waterman
,
and
there
be
my
boat
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
the
boat
serve
me
for
a
house
.
<EOS>
I
work
in
it
in
the
day
,
and
I
sleep
in
it
in
the
night
;
and
what
I
get
I
lie
down
upon
that
stone
,
"
say
he
,
show
me
a
broad
stone
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
a
good
way
from
his
house
;
"
and
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
halloo
,
and
call
to
them
till
I
make
them
hear
;
and
they
come
and
fetch
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
how
can
you
get
any
money
as
a
waterman
?
<EOS>
do
any
body
go
by
water
these
time
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
in
the
way
I
be
employ
there
do
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
there
,
"
say
he
,
"
five
ship
lie
at
anchor
"
(
point
down
the
river
a
good
way
below
the
town
)
,
"
and
do
you
see
"
,
say
he
,
"
eight
or
ten
ship
lie
at
the
chain
there
,
and
at
anchor
yonder
?
"
<EOS>
(
point
above
the
town
)
.
<EOS>
"
all
those
ship
have
family
on
board
,
of
their
merchant
and
owner
,
and
such
-
like
,
who
have
lock
themselves
up
and
live
on
board
,
close
shut
in
,
for
fear
of
the
infection
;
and
I
tend
on
them
to
fetch
thing
for
them
,
carry
letter
,
and
do
what
be
absolutely
necessary
,
that
they
may
not
be
oblige
to
come
on
shore
;
and
every
night
I
fasten
my
boat
on
board
one
of
the
ship
's
boat
,
and
there
I
sleep
by
myself
,
and
,
bless
<EOS>
be
God

I
be
preserve
hitherto

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
friend
,
but
will
they
let
you
come
on
board
after
you
have
be
on
shore
here
,
when
this
be
such
a
terrible
place
,
and
so
infected
as
it
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
as
to
that
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
very
seldom
go
up
the
ship
-
side
,
but
deliver
what
I
bring
to
their
boat
,
or
lie
by
the
side
,
and
they
hoist
it
on
board
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
,
I
think
they
be
in
no
danger
from
me
,
for
I
never
go
into
any
house
on
shore
,
or
touch
anybody
,
no
,
not
of
my
own
family
;
but
I
fetch
provision
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
that
may
be
bad
,
for
you
must
have
those
provision
of
somebody
or
other
;
and
since
all
this
part
of
the
town
be
so
infected
,
it
be
dangerous
so
much
as
to
speak
with
anybody
,
for
the
village
"
,
say
I
,
"
be
,
as
it
be
,
the
beginning
of
London
,
though
it
be
at
some
distance
from
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
add
he
;
"
but
you
do
not
understand
me
right
<EOS>
;
I
do
not
buy
provision
for
them
here
.
<EOS>
I
row
up
to
Greenwich
and
buy
fresh
meat
there
,
and
sometimes
I
row
down
the
river
to
Woolwich
and
buy
there
;
then
I
go
to
single
farm
-
house
on
the
kentish
side
,
where
I
be
know
,
and
buy
fowl
and
egg
and
butter
,
and
bring
to
the
ship
,
as
they
direct
me
,
sometimes
one
,
sometimes
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
seldom
come
on
shore
here
,
and
I
come
now
only
to
call
on
my
wife
and
hear
how
my
family
do
,
and
give
them
a
little
money
,
which
I
receive
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
man
!
"
say
I
;

and
how
much
hast
thou
get
for
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
four
shilling
,
"
say
he
,
"
which
be
a
great
sum
,
as
thing
go
now
with
poor
man
;
but
they
have
give
me
a
bag
of
bread
too
,
and
a
salt
fish

some
flesh
;
so
all
help
out
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"

I
,
"

have
you
give
it
them
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
I
have
call
,
and
my
wife
have
answer
that
she
can
not
come
out
yet
,
but
in
half
-
an
-
hour
she
hope
to
come
,

I
be
wait
for
her

poor
woman
!

"
say
he
,
"
she
be
bring
sadly
down
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
swelling
,
and
it
be
broke
,
and
I
hope
she
will
recover
;
but
I
fear
the
child
will
die
,
but
it
be
the
Lord
 
"
  
<EOS>
here
he
stop
,
and
weep
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
honest
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
thou
hast
a
sure
Comforter

thou
hast
bring
thyself

resign
to

deal
with

all
in
judgement

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
sir
!
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
infinite
mercy
if
any
of
us
be
spare
,
and
who
be
I
to
repine
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sayest
thou
so
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
"
and
how
much
less
be
my
faith
than
thine
?
"
<EOS>
and
here
my
heart
smote
me
,
suggest
how
much
well
this
poor
man
's
foundation
be
on
which
he
stay
in
the
danger
than
mine
;
that
he
have
nowhere
to
fly
;
that
he
have
a
family
to
bind
him
to
attendance
,
which
I
have
not
;
and
mine
be
mere
presumption
,
his
a
true
dependence
and
a
courage
rest
on
God
;
and
yet
that
he
use
all
possible
caution
for
his
safety
.
  
<EOS>
I
turn
a
little
way
from
the
man
while
these
thought
engage
me
,
for
,
indeed
,
I
could
no
more
refrain
from
tear
than
he
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
after
some
further
talk
,
the
poor
woman
open
the
door
and
call
,
"
Robert
,
Robert
"
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
and
bid
her
stay
a
few
moment
and
he
would
come
;
so
he
run
down
the
common
stair
to
his
boat
and
fetch
up
a
sack
,
in
which
be
the
provision
he
have
bring
from
the
ship
;
and
when
he
return
he
halloo
again
.
<EOS>
then
he
go
to
the
great
stone
which
he
show
me
and
empty
the
sack
,
and
lay
all
out
,
everything
by
themselves
,
and
then
retire
;
and
his
wife
come
with
a
little
boy
to
fetch
them
away
,
and
call
and
say
such
a
captain
have
send
such
a
thing
,
and
such
a
captain
such
a
thing
,
and
at
the
end
add
,
"
God
have
send
it
all
;
give
thank
to
Him
.
<EOS>
"
when
the
poor
woman
have
take
up
all
,
she
be
so
weak
she
could
not
carry
it
at
once
in
,
though
the
weight
be
not
much
neither
;
so
she
leave
the
biscuit
,
which
be
in
a
little
bag
,
and
leave
a
little
boy
to
watch
it
till
she
come
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
"
,
say
I
to
him
,
"
do
you
leave
her
the
four
shilling
too
,
which
you
say
be
your
week
's
pay
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
he
;
"
you
shall
hear
her
own
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
he
call
again
,
"
Rachel
,
Rachel
,
"
which
it
seem
be
her
name
,
"
do
you
take
up
the
money
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
how
much
be
it
?
"
say
he
.
"
<EOS>
four
shilling
and
a
groat
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
Lord
keep
you
all
"
;
and
so
he
turn
to
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
could
not
refrain
contribute
tear
to
this
man
's
story
,
so
neither
could
I
refrain
my
charity
for
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
so
I
call
him
,
"
hark
thee
,
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
come
hither
,
for
I
believe
thou
art
in
health
,
that
I
may
venture
thee
"
;
so
I
pull
out
my
hand
,
which
be
in
my
pocket
before
,
"
here
,
"
say
I
,
"
go
and
call
thy
Rachel
once
more
,
and
give
her
a
little
more
comfort
from
me
.
<EOS>
God
will
never
forsake
a
family
that
trust
in
Him
as
thou
dost
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
give
him
four
other
shilling
,
and
bid
him
go
lay
them
on
the
stone
and
call
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
word
to
express
the
poor
man
's
thankfulness
,
neither
could
he
express
it
himself
but
by
tear
run
down
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
call
his
wife
,
and
tell
her
God
have
move
the
heart
of
a
stranger
,
upon
hear
their
condition
,
to
give
them
all
that
money
,
and
a
great
deal
more
such
as
that
he
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
woman
,
too
,
make
sign
of
the
like
thankfulness
,
as
well
to
Heaven
as
to
me
,
and
joyfully
pick
it
up
;
and
I
part
with
no
money
all
that
year
that
I
think
better
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
ask
the
poor
man
if
the
distemper
have
not
reach
to
Greenwich
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
have
not
till
about
a
fortnight
before
;
but
that
then
he
fear
it
have
,
but
that
it
be
only
at
that
end
of
the
town
which
lie
south
towards
Deptford
Bridge
;
that
he
go
only
to
a
butcher
's
shop
and
a
grocer
's
,
where
he
generally
buy
such
thing
as
they
send
him
for
,
but
be
very
careful
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
then
how
it
come
to
pass
that
those
people
who
have
so
shut
themselves
up
in
the
ship
have
not
lay
in
sufficient
store
of
all
thing
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
say
some
of
them
have
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
some
do
not
come
on
board
till
they
be
fright
into
it
and
till
it
be
too
dangerous
for
them
to
go
to
the
proper
people
to
lay
in
quantity
of
thing
,
and
that
he
wait
on
two
ship
,
which
he
show
me
,
that
have
lay
in
little
or
nothing
but
biscuit
bread
and
ship
beer
,
and
that
he
have
buy
everything
else
almost
for
them
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
there
be
any
more
ship
that
have
separate
themselves
as
those
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
yes
,
all
the
way
up
from
the
point
,
right
against
Greenwich
,
to
within
the
shore
of
Limehouse
and
Redriff
,
all
the
ship
that
could
have
room
rid
two
and
two
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
,
and
that
some
of
them
have
several
family
on
board
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
the
distemper
have
not
reach
them
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
believe
it
have
not
,
except
two
or
three
ship
whose
people
have
not
be
so
watchful
to
keep
the
seaman
from
go
on
shore
as
other
have
be
,
and
he
say
it
be
a
very
fine
sight
to
see
how
the
ship
lie
up
the
Pool
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
say
he
be
go
over
to
Greenwich
as
soon
as
the
tide
begin
to
come
in
,
I
ask
if
he
would
let
me
go
with
him
and
bring
me
back
,
for
that
I
have
a
great
mind
to
see
how
the
ship
be
range
,
as
he
have
tell
me
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
if
I
would
assure
him
on
the
word
of
a
christian
and
of
an
honest
man
that
I
have
not
the
distemper
,
he
would
.
<EOS>
I
assure
him
that
I
have
not
;
that
it
have
please
God
to
preserve
me
;
that
I
live
in
Whitechappel
,
but
be
too
impatient
of
be
so
long
within
door
,
and
that
I
have
venture
out
so
far
for
the
refreshment
of
a
little
air
,
but
that
none
in
my
house
have
so
much
as
be
touch
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
your
charity
have
be
move
to
pity
me
and
my
poor
family
,
sure
you
can
not
have
so
little
pity
leave
as
to
put
yourself
into
my
boat
if
you
be
not
sound
in
health
which
would
be
nothing
less
than
kill
me
and
ruin
my
whole
family
.
<EOS>
"
the
poor
man
trouble
me
so
much
when
he
speak
of
his
family
with
such
a
sensible
concern
and
in
such
an
affectionate
manner
,
that
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
at
first
to
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
lay
aside
my
curiosity
rather
than
make
him
uneasy
,
though
I
be
sure
,
and
very
thankful
for
it
,
that
I
have
no
more
distemper
upon
me
than
the
fresh
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
would
not
have
me
put
it
off
neither
,
but
to
let
me
see
how
confident
he
be
that
I
be
just
to
him
,
now
importune
me
to
go
;
so
when
the
tide
come
up
to
his
boat
<EOS>
I
go
in
,
and
he
carry
me
to
Greenwich
.
<EOS>
while
he
buy
the
thing
which
he
have
in
his
charge
to
buy
,
I
walk
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
under
which
the
town
stand
,
and
on
the
east
side
of
the
town
,
to
get
a
prospect
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
surprising
sight
to
see
the
number
of
ship
which
lie
in
row
,
two
and
two
,
and
some
place
two
or
three
such
line
in
the
breadth
of
the
river
,
and
this
not
only
up
quite
to
the
town
,
between
the
house
which
we
call
Ratcliff
and
Redriff
,
which
they
name
the
Pool
,
but
even
down
the
whole
river
as
far
as
the
head
of
Long
Reach
,
which
be
as
far
as
the
hill
give
us
leave
to
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
guess
at
the
number
of
ship
,
but
I
think
there
must
be
several
hundred
of
sail
;
and
I
could
not
but
applaud
the
contrivance
:
for
ten
thousand
people
and
more
who
attend
ship
affair
be
certainly
shelter
here
from
the
violence
of
the
contagion
,
and
live
very
safe
and
very
easy
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
own
dwelling
very
well
satisfied
with
my
day
's
journey
,
and
particularly
with
the
poor
man
;
also
I
rejoice
to
see
that
such
little
sanctuary
be
provide
for
so
many
family
in
a
time
of
such
desolation
.
<EOS>
I
observe
also
that
,
as
the
violence
of
the
plague
have
increase
,
so
the
ship
which
have
family
on
board
remove
and
go
farther
off
,
till
,
as
I
be
tell
,
some
go
quite
away
to
sea
,
and
put
into
such
harbour
and
safe
road
on
the
north
coast
as
they
could
best
come
at
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
also
true
that
all
the
people
who
thus
leave
the
land
and
live
on
board
the
ship
be
not
entirely
safe
from
the
infection
,
for
many
die
and
be
throw
overboard
into
the
river
,
<EOS>
some
in
coffin
,
and
some
,
as
I
hear
,
without
coffin
,
whose
body
be
see
sometimes
to
drive
up
and
down
with
the
tide
in
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
believe
I
may
venture
to
say
that
in
those
ship
which
be
thus
infect
it
either
happen
where
the
people
have
recourse
to
them
too
late
,
and
do
not
fly
to
the
ship
till
they
have
stay
too
long
on
shore
and
have
the
distemper
upon
them
<EOS>
(
though
perhaps
they
may
not
perceive
it
)
and
so
the
distemper
do
not
come
to
them
on
board
the
ship
,
but
they
really
carry
it
with
them
;
or
it
be
in
these
ship
where
the
poor
waterman
say
they
have
not
have
time
to
furnish
themselves
with
provision
,
but
be
oblige
to
send
often
on
shore
to
buy
what
they
have
occasion
for
,
or
suffer
boat
to
come
to
them
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
distemper
be
bring
insensibly
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
can
not
but
take
notice
that
the
strange
temper
of
the
people
of
London
at
that
time
contribute
extremely
to
their
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
the
plague
begin
,
as
I
have
observe
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
namely
,
in
Long
Acre
,
Drury
Lane
,
&
c.
,
and
come
on
towards
the
city
very
gradually
and
slowly
.
<EOS>
It
be
feel
at
first
in
December
,
then
again
in
February
,
then
again
in
April
,
and
always
but
a
very
little
at
a
time
;
then
it
stop
till
May
,
and
even
the
last
week
in
May
there
be
but
seventeen
,
and
all
at
that
end
of
the
town
;
and
<EOS>
all
this
while
,
even
so
long
as
till
there
die
above
3000
a
week
,
yet
have
the
people
in
Redriff
,
and
in
Wapping
and
Ratcliff
,
on
both
side
of
the
river
,
and
almost
all
southwark
side
,
a
mighty
fancy
that
they
should
not
be
visit
,
or
at
least
that
it
would
not
be
so
violent
among
them
.
<EOS>
some
people
fancy
the
smell
of
the
pitch
and
tar
,
and
such
other
thing
as
oil
and
rosin
and
brimstone
,
which
be
so
much
use
by
all
trade
relate
to
shipping
,
would
preserve
them
.
<EOS>
other
argue
it
,
because
it
be
in
its
extream
violence
in
Westminster
and
the
parish
of
St
Giles
and
St
Andrew
,
&
c.
,
and
begin
to
abate
again
before
it
come
among
them
 
which
be
true
indeed
,
in
part
.

N.B.
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
observe
the
number
mention
in
Stepney
parish
at
that
time
be
generally
all
on
that
side
where
Stepney
parish
join
to
Shoreditch
,
which
we
now
call
Spittlefields
,
where
the
parish
of
Stepney
come
up
to
the
very
wall
of
Shoreditch
Churchyard
,
and
the
plague
at
this
time
be
abate
at
St
Giles
-
in
-
the
-
field
,
and
rage
most
violently
in
Cripplegate
,
Bishopsgate
,
and
Shoreditch
parish
;
but
there
be
not
ten
people
a
week
that
die
of
it
in
all
that
part
of
Stepney
parish
which
take
in
Limehouse
,
Ratdiff
Highway
,
and
which
be
now
the
parish
of
Shadwell
and
Wapping
,
even
to
St
Katherine
's
by
the
Tower
,
till
after
the
whole
month
of
August
be
expire
.
<EOS>
but
they
pay
for
it
afterwards
,
as
I
shall
observe
by
-
and
-
by
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
make
the
people
of
Redriff
and
Wapping
,
Ratcliff
and
Limehouse
,
so
secure
,
and
flatter
themselves
so
much
with
the
plague
be
go
off
without
reach
them
,
that
they
take
no
care
either
to
fly
into
the
country
or
shut
themselves
up
.
<EOS>
nay
,
so
far
be
they
from
stir
that
they
rather
receive
their
friend
and
relation
from
the
city
into
their
house
,
and
several
from
other
place
really
take
sanctuary
in
that
part
of
the
town
as
a
place
of
safety
,
and
as
a
place
which
they
think
God
would
pass
over
,
and
not
visit
as
the
rest
be
visit
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
reason
that
when
it
come
upon
 
them
they
be
more
surprised
,
more
unprovided
,
and
more
at
a
loss
what
to
do
than
they
be
in
other
place
;
for
when
it
come
among
them
really
and
with
violence
,
as
it
do
indeed
in
September
and
October
,
there
be
then
no
stir
out
into
the
country
,
nobody
would
suffer
a
stranger
to
come
near
them
,
no
,
nor
near
the
town
where
they
dwelt
;
and
,
as
I
have
be
tell
,
several
that
wander
into
the
country
on
Surrey
side
be
find
starve
to
death
in
the
wood
and
common
,
that
country
be
more
open
and
more
woody
than
any
other
part
so
near
London
,
especially
about
Norwood
and
the
parish
of
Camberwell
,
Dullege
,
and
Lusum
,
<EOS>
where
,
it
seem
,
nobody
durst
relieve
the
poor
distressed
people
for
fear
of
the
infection
.
  
<EOS>
this
notion
have
,
as
I
say
,
prevail
with
the
people
in
that
part
of
the
town
,
be
in
part
the
occasion
,
as
I
say
before
,
that
they
have
recourse
to
ship
for
their
retreat
;
and
where
they
do
this
early
and
with
prudence
,
furnish
themselves
so
with
provision
that
they
have
no
need
to
go
on
shore
for
supply
or
suffer
boat
to
come
on
board
to
bring
them
,
 
I
say
,
where
they
do
so
they
have
certainly
the
safe
retreat
of
any
people
whatsoever
;
but
the
distress
be
such
that
people
run
on
board
,
in
their
fright
,
without
bread
to
eat
,
and
some
into
ship
that
have
no
man
on
board
to
remove
them
farther
off
,
or
to
take
the
boat
and
go
down
the
river
to
buy
provision
where
it
may
be
do
safely
,
and
these
often
suffer
and
be
infect
on
board
as
much
as
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
rich
sort
get
into
ship
,
so
the
low
rank
get
into
hoy
,
smack
,
lighter
,
and
fishing
-
boat
;
and
many
,
especially
waterman
,
lie
in
their
boat
;
but
those
make
sad
work
of
it
,
especially
the
latter
,
for
,
go
about
for
provision
,
and
perhaps
to
get
their
subsistence
,
the
infection
get
in
among
them
and
make
a
fearful
havoc
;
many
of
the
waterman
die
alone
in
their
wherry
as
they
rid
at
their
road
,
as
well
as
above
bridge
as
below
,
and
be
not
find
sometimes
till
they
be
not
in
condition
for
anybody
to
touch
or
come
near
them
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
distress
of
the
people
at
this
seafare
end
of
the
town
be
very
deplorable
,
and
deserve
the
great
commiseration
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
I
this
be
a
time
when
every
one
's
private
safety
lie
so
near
them
that
they
have
no
room
to
pity
the
distress
of
other
;
for
every
one
have
death
,
as
it
be
,
at
his
door
,
and
many
even
in
their
family
,
and
know
not
what
to
do
or
whither
to
fly
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
take
away
all
compassion
;
self
-
preservation
,
indeed
,
appear
here
to
be
the
first
law
.
<EOS>
for
the
child
run
away
from
their
parent
as
they
languish
in
the
utmost
distress
.
<EOS>
and
in
some
place
,
though
not
so
frequent
as
the
other
,
parent
do
the
like
to
their
child
;
nay
,
some
dreadful
example
there
be
,
and
particularly
two
in
one
week
,
of
distressed
mother
,
raving
and
distract
,
kill
their
own
child
;
one
whereof
be
not
far
off
from
where
I
dwelt
,
the
poor
lunatic
creature
not
live
herself
long
enough
to
be
sensible
of
the
sin
of
what
she
have
do
,
much
less
to
be
punish
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
indeed
,
to
be
wonder
at
:
for
the
danger
of
immediate
death
to
ourselves
take
away
all
bowel
of
love
,
<EOS>
all
concern
for
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
speak
in
general
,
for
there
be
many
instance
of
immovable
affection
,
pity
,
and
duty
in
many
,
and
some
that
come
to
my
knowledge
,
that
be
to
say
,
by
hearsay
;
for
I
shall
not
take
upon
me
to
vouch
the
truth
of
the
particular
.
  
<EOS>
to
introduce
one
,
let
me
first
mention
that
one
of
the
most
deplorable
case
in
all
the
present
calamity
be
that
of
woman
with
child
,
who
,
when
they
come
to
the
hour
of
their
sorrow
,
and
their
pain
come
upon
them
,
could
neither
have
help
of
one
kind
or
another
;
neither
midwife
or
neighbour
woman
to
come
near
them
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
midwife
be
dead
,
especially
of
such
as
serve
the
poor
;
and
many
,
if
not
all
the
midwife
of
note
,
be
flee
into
the
country
;
so
that
it
be
next
to
impossible
for
a
poor
woman
that
could
not
pay
an
immoderate
price
to
get
any
midwife
to
come
to
her
 
<EOS>
and
if
they
do
,
those
they
could
get
be
generally
unskilful
and
ignorant
creature
;
and
the
consequence
of
this
be
that
a
most
unusual
and
incredible
number
of
woman
be
reduce
to
the
utmost
distress
.
<EOS>
some
be
deliver
and
spoil
by
the
rashness
and
ignorance
of
those
who
pretend
to
lay
them
.
<EOS>
child
without
number
be
,
I
may
say
,
murder
by
the
same
but
a
more
justifiable
ignorance
:
pretend
they
would
save
the
mother
,
<EOS>
whatever
become
of
the
child
;
and
many
time
both
mother
and
child
be
lose
in
the
same
manner
;
and
especially
where
the
mother
have
the
distemper
,
there
nobody
would
come
near
them
and
both
sometimes
perish
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
mother
have
die
of
the
plague
,
and
the
infant
,
it
may
be
,
half
bear
,
or
bear
but
not
part
from
the
mother
.
<EOS>
some
die
in
the
very
pain
of
their
travail
,
and
not
deliver
at
all
;
and
so
many
be
the
case
of
this
kind
that
it
be
hard
to
judge
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
something
of
it
will
appear
in
the
unusual
number
which
be
put
into
the
weekly
bill
(
though
I
be
far
from
allow
them
to
be
able
to
give
anything
of
a
full
account
)

the
article
of
     
Child

<EOS>
abortive

<EOS>
Christmas
and
Infants
.
  
<EOS>
take
the
week
in
which
the
plague
be
most
violent
,
and
compare
them
with
the
week
before
the
distemper
begin
,
even
in
the
same
year
.

there

in

during
the

and
September
as
be
in

<EOS>
in
a
word

the
usual
number
that
use
to
die
of
these
three
article
,
and
,
as
I
hear

do
die

<EOS>
this
inequality
,
I
say
,
be
exceedingly
augment
when
the
number
of
people
be
consider
.
<EOS>
I
pretend
not
to
make
any
exact
calculation
of
the
number
of
people
which
be
at
this
time
in
the
city
,
but
I
shall
make
a
probable
conjecture
at
that
part
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
say
now
be
to
explain
the
misery
of
those
poor
creature
above
;
so
that
it
may
well
be
say
,
as
in
the
scripture
,
Woe
be
to
those
who
be
with
child
,
and
to
those
which
give
suck
in
that
day
.
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
it
be
a
woe
to
them
in
particular
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
conversant
in
many
particular
family
where
these
thing
happen
,
but
the
outcry
of
the
miserable
be
hear
afar
off
.
<EOS>
as
to
those
who
be
with
child
,
we
have
see
some
calculation
make
;
291
woman
dead
in
child
-
bed
in
nine
week
,
out
of
one
-
third
part
of
the
number
of
whom
there
usually
die
in
that
time
but
eighty
-
four
of
the
same
disaster
.
<EOS>
let
the
reader
calculate
the
proportion
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
room
to
doubt
<EOS>
but
the
misery
of
those
that
give
suck
be
in
proportion
as
great
.
<EOS>
Our
bill
of
mortality
could
give
but
little
light
in
this
,
yet
some
it
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
more
than
usual
starve
at
nurse
,
but
this
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
misery
be
where
they
be
,
first
,
starve
for
want
of
a
nurse
,
the
mother
die
and
all
the
family
and
the
infant
<EOS>
find
dead
by
them
,
merely
for
want
;
and
,
if
I
may
speak
my
opinion
,
I
do
believe
that
many
hundred
of
poor
helpless
infant
perish
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
not
starve
,
but
poison
by
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
nay
,
even
where
the
mother
have
be
nurse
,
and
have
receive
the
infection
,
have
poison
,
that
is
,
infect
the
infant
with
her
milk
even
before
they
know
they
be
infect
themselves
;
nay
,
and
the
infant
have
die
in
such
a
case
before
the
mother
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
remember
to
leave
this
admonition
upon
record
,
if
ever
such
another
dreadful
visitation
should
happen
in
this
city
,
that
all
woman
that
be
with
child
or
that
give
suck
should
be
go
,
if
they
have
any
possible
mean
,
out
of
the
place
,
because
their
misery
,
if
infect
,
will
so
much
exceed
all
other
people
's
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
tell
here
dismal
story
of
living
infant
be
find
suck
the
breast
of
their
mother
,
or
nurse
,
after
they
have
be
dead
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
of
a
mother
in
the
parish
where
I
live
,
who
,
have
a
child
that
be
not
well
,
send
for
an
apothecary
to
view
the
child
;
and
when
he
come
,
as
the
relation
go
,
be
give
the
child
suck
at
her
breast
,
and
to
all
appearance
be
herself
very
well
;
but
when
the
apothecary
come
close
to
her
he
see
the
token
upon
that
breast
with
which
she
be
suckle
the
child
.
<EOS>
He
be
surprised
enough
,
to
be
sure
,
but
,
not
willing
to
fright
the
poor
woman
too
much
,
he
desire
she
would
give
the
child
into
his
hand
;
so
he
take
the
child
,
and
go
to
a
cradle
in
the
room
,
lay
it
in
,
and
open
its
cloth
,
find
the
token
upon
the
child
too
,
and
both
die
before
he
could
get
home
to
send
a
preventive
medicine
to
the
father
of
the
child
,
to
whom
he
have
tell
their
condition
.
<EOS>
whether
the
child
infect
the
nurse
-
mother
or
the
mother
<EOS>
the
child
be
not
certain
,
but
the
last
most
likely
.
<EOS>
likewise
of
a
child
bring
home
to
the
parent
from
a
nurse
that
have
die
of
the
plague
,
yet
the
tender
mother
would
not
refuse
to
take
in
her
child
,
and
lay
it
in
her
bosom
,
by
which
she
be
infect
;
and
die
with
the
child
in
her
arm
dead
also
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
make
the
hard
heart
move
at
the
instance
that
be
frequently
find
of
tender
mother
tend
and
watch
with
their
dear
child
,
and
even
die
before
them
,
and
sometimes
take
the
distemper
from
them
and
die
,
when
the
child
for
whom
the
affectionate
heart
have
be
sacrifice
have
get
over
it
and
escape
.
  
<EOS>
the
like
of
a
tradesman
in
East
Smithfield
,
whose
wife
be
big
with
child
of
her
first
child
,
and
fall
in
labour
,
have
the
plague
upon
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
neither
get
midwife
to
assist
her
or
nurse
to
tend
her
,
and
two
servant
which
he
keep
flee
both
from
her
.
<EOS>
He
run
from
house
to
house
like
one
distract
,
but
could
get
no
help
;
the
utmost
he
could
get
be
,
that
a
watchman
,
who
attend
at
an
infected
house
shut
up
,
promise
to
send
a
nurse
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
poor
man
,
with
his
heart
break
,
go
back
,
assist
his
wife
<EOS>
what
he
could
,
act
the
part
of
the
midwife
,
bring
the
child
dead
into
the
world
,
and
his
wife
in
about
an
hour
die
in
his
arm
,
where
he
hold
her
dead
body
fast
till
the
morning
,
when
the
watchman
come
and
bring
the
nurse
as
he
have
promise
;
and
come
up
the
stair
(
for
he
have
leave
the
door
open
,
or
only
latch
)
,
they
find
the
man
sit
with
his
dead
wife
in
his
arm
,
and
so
overwhelmed
with
grief
that
he
die
in
a
few
hour
after
without
any
sign
of
the
infection
upon
him
,
but
merely
sink
under
the
weight
of
his
grief
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
also
of
some
who
,
on
the
death
of
their
relation
,
have
grow
stupid
with
the
insupportable
sorrow
;
and
of
one
,
in
particular
,
who
be
so
absolutely
overcome
with
the
pressure
upon
his
spirit
that
by
degree
his
head
sink
into
his
body
,
so
between
his
shoulder
that
the
crown
of
his
head
be
very
little
see
above
the
bone
of
his
shoulder
;
and
by
degree
lose
both
voice
and
sense
,
his
face
,
look
forward
,
lie
against
his
collarbone
and
could
not
be
keep
up
any
otherwise
,
unless
hold
up
by
the
hand
of
other
people
;
and
the
poor
man
never
come
to
himself
again
,
but
languish
near
a
year
in
that
condition
,
and
die
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
ever
once
see
to
lift
up
his
eye
or
to
look
upon
any
particular
object
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
undertake
to
give
any
other
than
a
summary
of
such
passage
as
these
,
because
it
be
not
possible
to
come
at
the
particular
,
where
sometimes
the
whole
family
where
such
thing
happen
be
carry
off
by
the
distemper
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
innumerable
case
of
this
kind
which
present
to
the
eye
and
the
ear
,
even
in
pass
along
the
street
,
as
I
have
hint
above
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
easy
to
give
any
story
of
this
or
that
family
which
there
be
not
diver
parallel
story
to
be
meet
with
of
the
same
kind
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
now
talk
of
the
time
when
the
plague
rage
at
the
easternmost
part
of
the
town
 
<EOS>
how
for
a
long
time
the
people
of
those
part
have
flatter
themselves
that
they
should
escape
,
and
how
they
be
surprised
when
it
come
upon
them
as
it
do
;
for
,
indeed
,
it
come
upon
them
like
an
armed
man
when
it
do
come
;
 
I
say
,
this
bring
me
back
to
the
three
poor
man
who
wander
from
Wapping
,
not
know
whither
to
go
or
what
to
do
,
and
whom
I
mention
before
;
one
a
biscuit
-
baker
,
one
a
sailmaker
,
and
the
other
a
joiner
,
all
of
Wapping
,
or
there
-
about
.
  
<EOS>
the
sleepiness
and
security
of
that
part
,
as
I
have
observe
,
be
such
that
they
not
only
do
not
shift
for
themselves
as
other
do
,
but
they
boast
of
be
safe
,
and
of
safety
be
with
them
;
and
many
people
flee
out
of
the
city
,
and
out
of
the
infected
suburb
,
to
Wapping
,
Ratcliff
,
Limehouse
,
Poplar
,
and
such
Places
,
as
to
Places
of
security
;
and
it
be
not
at
all
unlikely
that
their
do
this
help
to
bring
the
plague
that
way
faster
than
it
may
otherwise
have
come
.
<EOS>
for
though
I
be
much
for
people
fly
away
and
empty
such
a
town
as
this
upon
the
first
appearance
of
a
like
visitation
,
and
that
all
people
who
have
any
possible
retreat
should
make
use
of
it
in
time
and
be
go
,
yet
I
must
say
,
when
all
that
will
fly
be
go
,
those
that
be
leave
and
must
stand
it
should
stand
stock
-
still
where
they
be
,
and
not
shift
from
one
end
of
the
town
or
one
part
of
the
town
to
the
other
;
for
that
be
the
bane
and
mischief
of
the
whole
,
and
they
carry
the
plague
from
house
to
house
in
their
very
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
wherefore
be
we
order
to
kill
all
the
dog
and
cat
,
but
because
as
they
be
domestic
animal
,
and
be
apt
to
run
from
house
to
house
and
from
street
to
street
,
so
they
be
capable
of
carry
the
effluvia
or
infectious
stream
of
body
infect
even
in
their
fur
and
hair
?
<EOS>
and
therefore
it
be
that
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
infection
,
an
order
be
publish
by
the
Lord
Mayor
,
and
by
the
magistrate
,
accord
to
the
advice
of
the
physician
,
that
all
the
dog
and
cat
should
be
immediately
kill
,
and
an
officer
be
appoint
for
the
execution
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
incredible
,
if
their
account
be
to
be
depend
upon
,
what
a
prodigious
number
of
those
creature
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
talk
of
forty
thousand
dog
,
and
five
time
as
many
cat
;
few
house
be
without
a
cat
,
some
have
several
,
sometimes
five
or
six
in
a
house
.
<EOS>
all
possible
endeavour
be
use
also
to
destroy
the
mouse
and
rat
,
especially
the
latter
,
by
lay
ratsbane
and
other
poison
for
them
,
and
a
prodigious
multitude
of
them
be
also
destroy
.
  
<EOS>
I
often
reflect
upon
the
unprovided
condition
that
the
whole
body
of
the
people
be
in
at
the
first
coming
of
this
calamity
upon
them
,
and
how
it
be
for
want
of
timely
enter
into
measure
and
management
,
as
well
public
as
private
,
that
all
the
confusion
that
follow
be
bring
upon
us
,
and
that
such
a
prodigious
number
of
people
sink
in
that
disaster
,
which
,
if
proper
step
have
be
take
,
may
,
Providence
concurring
,
have
be
avoid
,
and
which
,
if
posterity
think
fit
,
they
may
take
a
caution
and
warn
from
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
come
to
this
part
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
back
to
my
three
man
.
<EOS>
Their
story
have
a
moral
in
every
part
of
it
,
and
their
whole
conduct
,
and
that
of
some
whom
they
join
with
,
be
a
pattern
for
all
poor
man
to
follow
,
or
woman
either
,
if
ever
such
a
time
come
again
;
and
if
there
be
no
other
end
in
record
it
,
I
think
this
a
very
just
one
,
whether
my
account
be
exactly
accord
to
fact
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
two
of
them
be
say
to
be
brother
,
the
one
an
old
soldier
,
but
now
a
biscuit
-
maker
;
the
other
a
lame
sailor
,
but
now
a
sailmaker
;
the
third
a
joiner
.
<EOS>
say
John
the
biscuit
-
maker
one
day
to
Thomas
his
brother
,
the
sailmaker
,
"
Brother
Tom
,
what
will
become
of
us
?
<EOS>
the
plague
grow
hot
in
the
city
,
and
increase
this
way
.
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
truly
,
"
say
Thomas
,
"
I
be
at
a
great
loss
what
to
do
,
for
I
find
if
it
come
down
into
wapping
<EOS>
I
shall
be
turn
out
of
my
lodging
.
"
<EOS>
and
thus
they
begin
to
talk
of
it
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
turn
out
of
your
lodging
,
<EOS>
Tom
I
<EOS>
if
you
be
,
I
do
not
know
who
will
take
you
in
;
for
people
be
so
afraid
of
one
another
now
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
get
a
lodging
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
why
,
the
people
where
I
lodge
be
good
,
civil
people
,
and
have
kindness
enough
for
me
too
;
but
they
say
I
go
abroad
every
day
to
my
work
,
and
it
will
be
dangerous
;
and
they
talk
of
lock
themselves
up
and
let
nobody
come
near
them
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
why
,
they
be
in
the
right
,
to
be
sure
,
if
they
resolve
to
venture
stay
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
may
even
resolve
to
stay
within
door
too
,
for
,
except
a
suit
of
sail
that
my
master
have
in
hand
,
and
which
I
be
just
finish
,
I
be
like
to
get
no
more
work
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
trade
stir
now
.
<EOS>
workman
and
servant
be
turn
off
everywhere
,
so
that
I
may
be
glad
to
be
lock
up
too
;
but
I
do
not
see
they
will
be
willing
to
consent
to
that
,
any
more
than
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
why
,
what
will
you
do
then
,
brother
?
<EOS>
and
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
for
I
be
almost
as
bad
as
you
.
<EOS>
the
people
where
I
lodge
be
all
go
into
the
country
but
a
maid
,
and
she
be
to
go
next
week
,
and
to
shut
the
house
quite
up
,
so
that
I
shall
be
turn
adrift
to
the
wide
world
before
you
,
and
I
be
resolve
to
go
away
too
,
if
I
know
but
where
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
We
be
both
distract
<EOS>
we
do
not
go
away
at
first
;
then
we
may
have
travel
anywhere
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
stirring
now
;
we
shall
be
starve
if
we
pretend
to
go
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
They
will
not
let
us
have
victual
,
no
,
not
for
our
money
,
nor
let
us
come
into
the
town
,
much
less
into
their
house
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
and
that
which
be
almost
as
bad
<EOS>
,
I
have
but
little
money
to
help
myself
with
neither
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
we
may
make
shift
,
I
have
a
little
,
though
not
much
;
but
I
tell
you
there
be
no
stirring
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
couple
of
poor
honest
man
in
our
street
have
attempt
to
travel
,
and
at
Barnet
,
or
whetstone
,
or
thereabout
,
the
people
offer
to
fire
at
them
if
they
pretend
to
go
forward
,
so
they
be
come
back
again
quite
discourage
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
venture
their
fire
if
I
have
be
there
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
deny
food
for
my
money
they
should
have
see
me
take
it
before
their
face
,
and
if
I
have
tender
money
for
it
they
could
not
have
take
any
course
with
me
by
law
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
You
talk
your
old
soldier
's
language
,
as
if
you
be
in
the
Low
Countries
now
,
but
this
be
a
serious
thing
.
<EOS>
the
people
have
good
reason
to
keep
anybody
off
that
they
be
not
satisfied
be
sound
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
and
we
must
not
plunder
them
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
no
,
brother
,
you
mistake
the
case
,
and
mistake
me
too
.
<EOS>
I
would
plunder
nobody
;
but
for
any
town
upon
the
road
to
deny
me
leave
to
pass
through
the
town
in
the
open
highway
,
and
deny
me
provision
for
my
money
,
be
to
say
the
town
have
a
right
to
starve
me
to
death
,
which
can
not
be
true
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
but
they
do
not
deny
you
liberty
to
go
back
again
from
whence
<EOS>
you
come
,
and
therefore
they
do
not
starve
you
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
but
the
next
town
behind
me
will
,
by
the
same
rule
,
deny
me
leave
to
go
back
,
and
so
they
do
starve
me
between
them
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
no
law
to
prohibit
my
travelling
wherever
I
will
on
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
but
there
will
be
so
much
difficulty
in
dispute
with
them
at
every
town
on
the
road
that
it
be
not
for
poor
man
to
do
it
or
undertake
it
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
be
especially
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
why
,
brother
,
our
condition
at
this
rate
be
bad
than
anybody
else
's
,
for
we
can
neither
go
away
nor
stay
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
of
the
same
mind
with
the
leper
of
Samaria
:
"
if
we
stay
here
we
be
sure
to
die
"
,
I
mean
especially
as
you
and
I
be
state
,
without
a
dwelling
-
house
of
our
own
,
and
without
lodge
in
anybody
else
's
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
lying
in
the
street
at
such
a
time
as
this
;
we
have
as
good
go
into
the
dead
-
cart
at
once
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
say
,
if
we
stay
here
we
be
sure
to
die
,
and
if
we
go
away
<EOS>
we
can
but
die
;
I
be
resolve
to
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
You
will
go
away
.
<EOS>
whither
will
you
go
,
and
what
can
you
do
?
<EOS>
I
would
as
willingly
go
away
as
you
,
if
I
know
whither
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
no
acquaintance
,
no
friend
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
bear
,
and
here
we
must
die
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
look
you
,
Tom
,
the
whole
kingdom
be
my
native
country
as
well
as
this
town
.
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
say
I
must
not
go
out
of
my
house
if
it
be
on
fire
as
that
I
must
not
go
out
of
the
town
I
be
bear
in
when
it
be
infect
with
the
plague
.
<EOS>
I
be
bear
in
England
,
and
have
a
right
to
live
in
it
if
I
can
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
every
vagrant
person
may
by
the
law
of
England
be
take
up
,
and
pass
back
to
their
last
legal
settlement
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
but
how
shall
they
make
me
vagrant
?
<EOS>
I
desire
only
to
travel
on
,
upon
my
lawful
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
what
lawful
occasion
can
we
pretend
to
travel
,
or
rather
wander
upon
?
<EOS>
They
will
not
be
put
off
with
word
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
be
not
fly
to
save
our
life
a
lawful
occasion
?
<EOS>
and
do
they
not
all
know
that
the
fact
be
true
?
<EOS>
We
can
not
be
say
to
dissemble
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
but
suppose
they
let
us
pass
,
whither
shall
we
go
?
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
anywhere
,
to
save
our
life
;
it
be
time
enough
to
consider
that
when
we
be
get
out
of
this
town
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
once
out
of
this
dreadful
place
,
I
care
not
where
I
go
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
drive
to
great
extremity
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
well
,
Tom
,
consider
of
it
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
about
the
beginning
of
July
;
and
though
the
plague
be
come
forward
in
the
west
and
north
part
of
the
town
,
yet
all
wapping
,
as
I
have
observe
before
,
and
Redriff
,
and
Ratdiff
,
and
limehouse
,
and
Poplar
,
in
short
,
Deptford
and
Greenwich
,
all
both
side
of
the
river
from
the
Hermitage
,
and
from
over
against
it
,
quite
down
to
Blackwall
,
be
entirely
free
;
there
have
not
one
person
die
of
the
plague
in
all
Stepney
parish
,
and
not
one
on
the
south
side
of
Whitechappel
Road
,
no
,
not
in
any
parish
;
and
yet
the
weekly
bill
be
that
very
week
rise
up
to
1006
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
fortnight
after
this
before
the
two
brother
meet
again
,
and
then
the
case
be
a
little
altered
,
and
the
'
plague
be
exceedingly
advanced
and
the
number
greatly
increase
;
the
bill
be
up
at
2785
,
and
prodigiously
increase
,
though
still
both
side
of
the
river
,
as
below
,
keep
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
but
some
begin
to
die
in
Redriff
,
and
about
five
or
six
in
Ratdiff
Highway
,
when
the
sailmaker
come
to
his
brother
John
express
,
and
in
some
fright
;
for
he
be
absolutely
warn
out
of
his
lodging
,
and
have
only
a
week
to
provide
himself
.
<EOS>
His
brother
John
be
in
as
bad
a
case
,
for
he
be
quite
out
,
and
have
only
beg
leave
of
his
master
,
the
biscuit
-
maker
,
to
lodge
in
an
outhouse
belong
to
his
workhouse
,
where
he
only
lie
upon
straw
,
with
some
biscuit
-
sack
,
or
bread
-
sack
,
as
they
call
them
,
lay
upon
it
,
and
some
of
the
same
sack
to
cover
him
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
resolve
(
see
all
employment
be
at
an
end
,
and
no
work
or
wage
to
be
have
)
,
they
would
make
the
good
of
their
way
to
get
out
of
the
reach
of
the
dreadful
infection
,
and
,
be
as
good
husband
as
they
could
,
would
endeavour
to
live
upon
what
they
have
as
long
as
it
would
last
,
and
then
work
for
more
if
they
could
get
work
anywhere
,
of
any
kind
,
let
it
be
what
it
would
.
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
consider
to
put
this
resolution
in
practice
in
the
good
manner
they
could
,
the
third
man
,
who
be
acquaint
very
well
with
the
sailmaker
,
come
to
know
of
the
design
,
and
get
leave
to
be
one
of
the
number
;
and
thus
they
prepare
to
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
they
have
not
an
equal
share
of
money
;
but
as
the
sailmaker
,
who
have
the
good
stock
,
be
,
besides
his
being
lame
,
the
most
unfit
to
expect
to
get
anything
by
work
in
the
country
,
so
he
be
content
that
what
money
they
have
should
all
go
into
one
public
stock
,
on
condition
that
whatever
any
one
of
them
could
gain
more
than
another
,
it
should
without
any
grudging
be
all
add
to
the
public
stock
.
  
<EOS>
They
resolve
to
load
themselves
with
as
little
baggage
as
possible
because
they
resolve
at
first
to
travel
on
foot
,
and
to
go
a
great
way
that
they
may
,
if
possible
,
be
effectually
safe
;
and
a
great
many
consultation
they
have
with
themselves
before
they
could
agree
about
what
way
they
should
travel
,
which
they
be
so
far
from
adjust
that
even
to
the
morning
they
set
out
they
be
not
resolve
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
seaman
put
in
a
hint
that
determine
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
first
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
weather
be
very
hot
,
and
therefore
I
be
for
travel
north
,
that
we
may
not
have
the
sun
upon
our
face
and
beat
on
our
breast
,
which
will
heat
and
suffocate
us
;
and
I
have
be
tell
"
,
say
he
,
"
that
it
be
not
good
to
overheat
our
blood
at
a
time
when
,
for
aught
we
know
,
the
infection
may
be
in
the
very
air
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
for
go
the
way
that
may
be
contrary
to
the
wind
,
as
it
may
blow
when
we
set
out
,
that
we
may
not
have
the
wind
blow
the
air
of
the
city
on
our
back
as
we
go
.
"
<EOS>
these
two
caution
be
approve
of
,
if
it
could
be
bring
so
to
hit
that
the
wind
may
not
be
in
the
south
when
they
set
out
to
go
north
.
  
<EOS>
John
the
baker
,
who
bad
be
a
soldier
,
then
put
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
first
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
none
of
us
expect
to
get
any
lodging
on
the
road
,
and
it
will
be
a
little
too
hard
to
lie
just
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
though
it
be
warm
weather
,
yet
it
may
be
wet
and
damp
,
and
we
have
a
double
reason
to
take
care
of
our
health
at
such
a
time
as
this
;
and
therefore
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
,
<EOS>
brother
Tom
,
that
be
a
sailmaker
,
may
easily
make
us
a
little
tent
,
and
I
will
undertake
to
set
it
up
every
night
,
and
take
it
down
,
and
a
fig
for
all
the
inn
in
England
;
if
we
have
a
good
tent
over
our
head
we
shall
do
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
joiner
oppose
this
,
and
tell
them
,
let
them
leave
that
to
him
;
he
would
undertake
to
build
them
a
house
every
night
with
his
hatchet
and
mallet
,
though
he
have
no
other
tool
,
which
should
be
fully
to
their
satisfaction
,
and
as
good
as
a
tent
.
  
<EOS>
the
soldier
and
the
joiner
dispute
that
point
some
time
,
but
at
last
the
soldier
carry
it
for
a
tent
.
<EOS>
the
only
objection
against
it
be
,
that
it
must
be
carry
with
them
,
and
that
would
increase
their
baggage
too
much
,
the
weather
be
hot
;
but
the
sailmaker
have
a
piece
of
good
hap
fall
in
which
make
that
easy
,
for
his
master
whom
he
work
for
,
have
a
rope
-
walk
as
well
as
sailmake
trade
,
have
a
little
,
poor
horse
that
he
make
no
use
of
then
;
and
be
willing
to
assist
the
three
honest
man
,
he
give
them
the
horse
for
the
carry
their
baggage
;
also
for
a
small
matter
of
three
day
'
work
that
his
man
do
for
him
<EOS>
before
he
go
,
he
let
him
have
an
old
top
-
gallant
sail
that
be
wear
out
,
but
be
sufficient
and
more
than
enough
to
make
a
very
good
tent
.
<EOS>
the
soldier
show
how
to
shape
it
,
and
they
soon
by
his
direction
make
their
tent
,
and
fit
it
with
pole
or
stave
for
the
purpose
;
and
thus
they
be
furnish
for
their
journey
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
three
man
,
one
tent
,
one
horse
,
one
gun
 
for
the
soldier
would
not
go
without
arm
,
for
now
he
say
he
be
no
more
a
biscuit
-
baker
,
but
a
trooper
.
  
<EOS>
the
joiner
have
a
small
bag
of
tool
such
as
may
be
useful
if
he
should
get
any
work
abroad
,
as
well
for
their
subsistence
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
what
money
they
have
they
bring
all
into
one
public
stock
,
and
thus
they
begin
their
journey
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
in
the
morning
when
they
set
out
the
wind
blow
,
as
the
sailor
say
,
by
his
pocket
-
compass
,
at
N.W.
by
W.
<EOS>
so
they
direct
,
or
rather
resolve
to
direct
,
their
course
N.W.
  
<EOS>
but
then
a
difficulty
come
in
their
way
,
that
,
as
they
set
out
from
the
hither
end
of
wapping
,
near
the
hermitage
,
and
that
the
plague
be
now
very
violent
,
especially
on
the
north
side
of
the
city
,
as
in
Shoreditch
and
Cripplegate
parish
,
they
do
not
think
it
safe
for
them
to
go
near
those
part
;
so
they
go
away
east
through
Ratcliff
Highway
as
far
as
Ratcliff
Cross
,
and
leave
Stepney
Church
still
on
their
left
hand
,
be
afraid
to
come
up
from
Ratcliff
Cross
to
<EOS>
Mile
End
,
because
they
must
come
just
by
the
churchyard
,
and
because
the
wind
,
that
seem
to
blow
more
from
the
west
,
blow
directly
from
the
side
of
the
city
where
the
plague
be
hot
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
say
,
leave
Stepney
they
fetch
a
long
compass
,
and
go
to
Poplar
and
Bromley
,
come
into
the
great
road
just
at
Bow
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
watch
place
upon
Bow
Bridge
would
have
question
them
,
but
they
,
cross
the
road
into
a
narrow
way
that
turn
out
of
the
hither
end
of
the
town
of
Bow
to
Old
Ford
,
avoid
any
inquiry
there
,
and
travel
to
Old
Ford
.
<EOS>
the
constable
everywhere
be
upon
their
guard
not
so
much
,
<EOS>
It
seem
,
to
stop
people
pass
by
as
to
stop
them
from
take
up
their
abode
in
their
town
,
and
withal
because
of
a
report
that
be
newly
raise
at
that
time
:
and
that
,
indeed
,
be
not
very
improbable
,
viz
.
,
that
the
poor
people
in
London
,
be
distress
and
starve
for
want
of
work
,
and
by
that
mean
for
want
of
bread
,
be
up
in
arm
and
have
raise
a
tumult
,
and
that
they
would
come
out
to
all
the
town
round
to
plunder
for
bread
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
be
only
a
rumour
,
and
it
be
very
well
<EOS>
it
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
far
off
from
be
a
reality
as
it
have
be
think
,
for
in
a
few
week
more
the
poor
people
become
so
desperate
by
the
calamity
they
suffer
that
they
be
with
great
difficulty
keep
from
g
out
into
the
field
and
town
,
and
tear
all
in
piece
wherever
they
come
;
and
,
as
I
have
observe
before
,
nothing
hinder
them
but
that
the
plague
rage
so
violently
and
fall
in
upon
them
so
furiously
that
they
rather
go
to
the
grave
by
thousand
than
into
the
field
in
mob
by
thousand
;
<EOS>
for
,
in
the
part
about
the
parish
of
St
Sepulcher
,
Clarkenwell
,
Cripplegate
,
Bishopsgate
,
and
Shoreditch
,
which
be
the
place
where
the
mob
begin
to
threaten
,
the
distemper
come
on
so
furiously
that
there
die
in
those
few
parish
even
then
,
before
the
plague
be
come
to
its
height
,
<EOS>
no
less
than
5361
people
in
the
first
three
week
in
August
;
when
at
the
same
time
the
part
about
Wapping
,
Radcliffe
,
and
Rotherhith
be
,
as
before
describe
,
hardly
touch
,
or
but
very
lightly
;
so
that
in
a
word
though
,
as
I
say
before
,
the
good
management
of
the
Lord
Mayor
and
justice
do
much
to
prevent
the
rage
and
desperation
of
the
people
from
break
out
in
rabble
and
tumult
,
and
in
short
from
the
poor
plunder
the
rich
,
 
I
say
,
though
they
do
much
<EOS>
,
the
dead
-
cart
do
more
:
for
as
I
have
say
that
in
five
parish
only
there
die
above
5000
in
twenty
day
,
so
there
may
be
probably
three
time
that
number
sick
all
that
time
;
for
some
recover
,
and
great
number
fall
sick
every
day
and
die
afterwards
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
must
still
be
allow
to
say
that
if
the
bill
of
mortality
say
five
thousand
,
I
always
believe
it
be
near
twice
as
many
in
reality
,
there
be
no
room
to
believe
that
the
account
they
give
be
right
,
or
that
indeed
they
be
among
such
confusion
as
I
see
them
in
,
in
any
condition
to
keep
an
exact
account
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
traveller
.
<EOS>
here
they
be
only
examine
,
and
as
they
seem
rather
come
from
the
country
than
from
the
city
,
they
find
the
people
the
easy
with
them
;
that
they
talk
to
them
,
let
them
come
into
a
public
-
house
where
the
constable
and
his
warder
be
,
and
give
them
drink
and
some
victual
which
greatly
refresh
and
encourage
them
;
and
here
it
come
into
their
head
to
say
,
when
they
should
be
inquire
of
afterwards
,
not
that
they
come
from
London
,
but
that
they
come
out
of
Essex
.
  
<EOS>
to
forward
this
little
fraud
,
they
obtain
so
much
favour
of
the
constable
at
Old
Ford
as
to
give
them
a
certificate
of
their
passing
from
Essex
through
that
village
,
and
that
they
have
not
be
at
London
;
which
,
though
false
in
the
common
acceptance
of
London
in
the
county
,
yet
be
literally
true
,
Wapping
or
Ratcliff
be
no
part
either
of
the
city
or
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
this
certificate
direct
to
the
next
constable
that
be
at
Homerton
,
one
of
the
hamlet
of
the
parish
of
Hackney
,
be
so
serviceable
to
them
that
it
procure
them
,
not
a
free
passage
there
only
,
but
a
full
certificate
of
health
from
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
who
upon
the
constable
's
application
grant
it
without
much
difficulty
;
and
thus
they
pass
through
the
long
divide
town
of
Hackney
(
for
it
lie
then
in
several
separated
hamlet
)
,
and
travel
on
till
they
come
into
the
great
north
road
on
the
top
of
Stamford
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
begin
to
be
weary
,
and
so
in
the
back
-
road
from
Hackney
,
a
little
before
it
open
into
the
say
great
road
,
they
resolve
to
set
up
their
tent
and
encamp
for
the
first
night
,
which
they
do
accordingly
,
with
this
addition
,
that
find
a
barn
,
or
a
building
like
a
barn
,
and
first
search
as
well
as
they
could
to
be
sure
there
be
nobody
in
it
,
they
set
up
their
tent
,
with
the
head
of
it
against
the
barn
.
<EOS>
this
they
do
also
because
the
wind
blow
that
night
very
high
,
and
they
be
but
young
at
such
a
way
of
lodging
,
as
well
as
at
the
manage
their
tent
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
go
to
sleep
;
but
the
joiner
,
a
grave
and
sober
man
,
and
not
pleased
with
their
lying
at
this
loose
rate
the
first
night
,
could
not
sleep
,
and
resolve
,
after
try
to
sleep
to
no
purpose
,
that
he
would
get
out
,
and
,
take
the
gun
in
his
hand
,
stand
sentinel
and
guard
his
companion
.
<EOS>
so
with
the
gun
in
his
hand
,
he
walk
to
and
again
before
the
barn
,
for
that
stand
in
the
field
near
the
road
,
but
within
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
long
upon
the
scout
but
he
hear
a
noise
of
people
come
on
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
great
number
,
and
they
come
on
,
as
he
think
,
directly
towards
the
barn
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
presently
awake
his
companion
;
but
in
a
few
minute
more
,
their
noise
grow
louder
and
louder
,
the
biscuit
-
baker
call
to
him
and
ask
him
what
be
the
matter
,
and
quickly
start
out
too
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
be
the
lame
sailmaker
and
most
weary
,
lie
still
in
the
tent
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
expect
,
so
the
people
whom
they
have
hear
come
on
directly
to
the
barn
,
when
one
of
our
traveller
challenge
,
like
soldier
upon
the
guard
,
with
"
who
come
there
?
<EOS>
"
the
people
do
not
answer
immediately
,
but
one
of
them
speak
to
another
that
be
behind
him
,
"
alas
<EOS>
I
alas
<EOS>
I
we
be
all
disappointed
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
some
people
before
us
;
the
barn
be
take
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
stop
upon
that
,
as
under
some
surprise
,
and
it
seem
there
be
about
thirteen
of
them
in
all
,
and
some
woman
among
them
.
<EOS>
They
consult
together
what
they
should
do
,
and
by
their
discourse
our
traveller
soon
find
they
be
poor
,
distressed
people
too
,
like
themselves
,
seek
shelter
and
safety
;
and
besides
,
our
traveller
have
no
need
to
be
afraid
of
their
come
up
to
disturb
them
,
for
as
soon
as
they
hear
the
word
,
"
<EOS>
who
come
there
?
<EOS>
"
these
could
hear
the
woman
say
,
as
if
fright
,
"
do
not
go
near
them
.
<EOS>
how
do
you
know
<EOS>
but
they
may
have
the
plague
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
one
of
the
man
say
,
"
let
us
but
speak
to
them
"
,
the
woman
say
,
"
no
,
do
not
by
any
mean
.
<EOS>
We
have
escape
thus
far
by
the
goodness
of
God
;
do
not
let
us
run
into
danger
now
,
we
beseech
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Our
traveller
find
by
this
that
they
be
a
good
,
sober
sort
of
people
,
and
fly
for
their
life
,
as
they
be
;
and
,
as
they
be
encourage
by
it
,
so
John
say
to
the
joiner
,
his
comrade
,
"
let
us
encourage
them
too
as
much
as
we
can
'
;
so
he
call
to
them
,
"
Hark
ye
,
good
people
,
"
say
the
joiner
,
"
we
find
by
your
talk
that
you
be
fly
from
the
same
dreadful
enemy
as
we
be
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
afraid
of
us
;
we
be
only
three
poor
man
of
us
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
free
from
the
distemper
you
shall
not
be
hurt
by
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
in
the
barn
,
but
in
a
little
tent
here
in
the
outside
,
and
we
will
remove
for
you
;
we
can
set
up
our
tent
again
immediately
anywhere
else
"
;
and
upon
this
a
parley
begin
between
the
joiner
,
whose
name
be
Richard
,
and
one
of
their
man
,
who
say
his
name
be
Ford
.
  
<EOS>
Ford
.
<EOS>
and
do
you
assure
us
that
you
be
all
sound
man
?
  
<EOS>
Richard
.
<EOS>
nay
,
we
be
concerned
to
tell
you
of
it
,
that
you
may
not
be
uneasy
or
think
yourself
in
danger
;
but
you
see
we
do
not
desire
you
should
put
yourself
into
any
danger
,
and
therefore
I
tell
you
that
we
have
not
make
use
of
the
barn
,
so
we
will
remove
from
it
,
that
you
may
be
safe
and
we
also
.
  
<EOS>
Ford
.
<EOS>
that
be
very
kind
and
charitable
;
but
if
we
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
that
you
be
sound
and
free
from
the
visitation
,
why
should
we
make
you
remove
now
<EOS>
you
be
settle
in
your
lodging
,
and
,
it
may
be
,
be
lay
down
to
rest
?
<EOS>
We
will
go
into
the
barn
,
if
you
please
,
to
rest
ourselves
a
while
,
and
we
need
not
disturb
you
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
.
<EOS>
well
,
but
you
be
more
than
we
be
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
assure
us
that
you
be
all
of
you
sound
too
,
for
the
danger
be
as
great
from
you
to
us
as
from
us
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Ford
.
<EOS>
bless
be
God
that
some
do
escape
,
<EOS>
though
it
be
but
few
;
what
may
be
our
portion
<EOS>
still
we
know
not
,
but
hitherto
we
be
preserve
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
.
<EOS>
what
part
of
the
town
do
you
come
from
?
<EOS>
be
the
plague
come
to
the
place
where
you
live
?
  
<EOS>
Ford
.
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
in
a
most
frightful
and
terrible
manner
,
or
else
we
have
not
flee
away
as
we
do
;
but
we
believe
there
will
be
very
few
leave
alive
behind
us
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
.
<EOS>
what
part
do
you
come
from
?
  
<EOS>
Ford
.
<EOS>
We
be
most
of
us
of
Cripplegate
parish
,
only
two
or
three
of
Clerkenwell
parish
,
but
on
the
hither
side
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
.
<EOS>
how
then
be
it
that
you
come
away
no
sooner
?
  
<EOS>
Ford
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
away
some
time
,
and
keep
together
as
well
as
we
could
at
the
hither
end
of
Islington
,
where
we
get
leave
to
lie
in
an
old
uninhabited
house
,
and
have
some
bedding
and
convenience
of
our
own
that
we
bring
with
us
;
but
the
plague
be
come
up
into
Islington
too
,
and
a
house
next
door
to
our
poor
dwelling
be
infect
and
shut
up
;
and
we
be
come
away
in
a
fright
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
.
<EOS>
and
what
way
be
you
go
?
  
<EOS>
Ford
.
<EOS>
as
our
lot
shall
cast
us
;
we
know
not
whither
,
but
God
will
guide
those
that
look
up
to
Him
.
  
<EOS>
They
parley
no
further
at
that
time
,
but
come
all
up
to
the
barn
,
and
with
some
difficulty
get
into
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
but
hay
in
the
barn
,
but
it
be
almost
full
of
that
,
and
they
accommodate
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
,
and
go
to
rest
;
but
our
traveller
observe
that
before
they
go
to
sleep
an
ancient
man
who
it
seem
be
father
of
one
of
the
woman
,
go
to
prayer
with
all
the
company
,
recommend
themselves
to
the
blessing
and
direction
of
Providence
,
before
they
go
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
soon
day
at
that
time
of
the
year
,
and
as
Richard
the
joiner
have
keep
guard
the
first
part
of
the
night
,
so
John
the
soldier
relieve
him
,
and
he
have
the
post
in
the
morning
,
and
they
begin
to
be
acquaint
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
It
seem
when
they
leave
Islington
they
intend
to
have
go
north
,
away
to
Highgate
,
but
be
stop
at
Holloway
,
and
there
they
would
not
let
them
pass
;
so
they
cross
over
the
field
and
hill
to
the
eastward
,
and
come
out
at
the
Boarded
River
,
and
so
avoid
the
town
,
they
leave
Hornsey
on
the
left
hand
and
Newington
on
the
right
hand
,
and
come
into
the
great
road
about
Stamford
Hill
on
that
side
,
as
the
three
traveller
have
do
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
and
now
they
have
thought
of
go
over
the
river
in
the
marsh
,
and
make
forward
to
Epping
Forest
,
where
they
hope
they
should
get
leave
to
rest
.
<EOS>
It
seem
they
be
not
poor
,
at
least
not
so
poor
as
to
be
in
want
;
at
least
they
have
enough
to
subsist
them
moderately
for
two
or
three
month
,
when
,
as
they
say
,
they
be
in
hope
<EOS>
the
cold
weather
would
check
the
infection
,
or
at
least
the
violence
of
it
would
have
spend
itself
,
and
would
abate
,
if
it
be
only
for
want
of
people
leave
alive
to
be
infect
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
much
the
fate
of
our
three
traveller
,
only
that
they
seem
to
be
the
better
furnish
for
travel
,
and
have
it
in
their
view
to
go
farther
off
;
for
as
to
the
first
,
they
do
not
propose
to
go
farther
than
one
day
's
journey
,
that
so
they
may
have
intelligence
every
two
or
three
day
how
thing
be
at
London
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
our
traveller
find
themselves
under
an
unexpected
inconvenience
:
namely
that
of
their
horse
,
for
by
mean
of
the
horse
to
carry
their
baggage
they
be
oblige
to
keep
in
the
road
,
whereas
the
people
of
this
other
band
go
over
the
field
or
road
,
path
or
no
path
,
way
or
no
way
,
as
they
please
;
neither
have
they
any
occasion
to
pass
through
any
town
,
or
come
near
any
town
,
other
than
to
buy
such
thing
as
they
want
for
their
necessary
subsistence
,
and
in
that
indeed
they
be
put
to
much
difficulty
;
of
which
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
three
traveller
be
oblige
to
keep
the
road
,
or
else
they
must
commit
spoil
,
and
do
the
country
a
great
deal
of
damage
in
break
down
fence
and
gate
to
go
over
enclose
field
,
which
they
be
loth
to
do
if
they
could
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
Our
three
traveller
,
however
,
have
a
great
mind
to
join
themselves
to
this
company
and
take
their
lot
with
them
;
and
after
some
discourse
they
lay
aside
their
first
design
which
look
northward
,
and
resolve
to
follow
the
other
into
Essex
;
so
in
the
morning
they
take
up
their
tent
and
load
their
horse
,
and
away
they
travel
all
together
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
some
difficulty
in
pass
the
ferry
at
the
river
-
side
,
the
ferryman
be
afraid
of
them
;
but
after
some
parley
at
a
distance
,
the
ferryman
be
content
to
bring
his
boat
to
a
place
distant
from
the
usual
ferry
,
and
leave
it
there
for
them
to
take
it
;
so
put
themselves
over
,
he
direct
them
to
leave
the
boat
,
and
<EOS>
he
,
have
another
boat
,
say
he
would
fetch
it
again
,
which
it
seem
,
however
,
he
do
not
do
for
above
eight
day
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
give
the
ferryman
money
beforehand
,
they
have
a
supply
of
victual
and
drink
,
which
he
bring
and
leave
in
the
boat
for
them
;
but
not
without
,
as
I
say
,
have
receive
the
money
beforehand
.
<EOS>
but
now
our
traveller
be
at
a
great
loss
and
difficulty
how
to
get
the
horse
over
,
the
boat
be
small
and
not
fit
for
it
:
and
at
last
could
not
do
it
without
unload
the
baggage
and
make
him
swim
over
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
river
they
travel
towards
the
forest
,
but
when
they
come
to
walthamstow
the
people
of
that
town
deny
to
admit
them
,
as
be
the
case
everywhere
.
<EOS>
the
constable
and
their
watchman
keep
them
off
at
a
distance
and
parley
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
give
the
same
account
of
themselves
as
before
,
but
these
give
no
credit
to
what
they
say
,
give
it
for
a
reason
that
two
or
three
company
have
already
come
that
way
and
make
the
like
pretence
,
but
that
they
have
give
several
people
the
distemper
in
the
town
where
they
have
pass
;
and
have
be
afterwards
so
hardly
use
by
the
country
(
though
with
justice
,
too
,
as
they
have
deserve
)
that
about
Brentwood
,
or
that
way
,
several
of
them
perish
in
the
field
 
whether
of
the
plague
or
of
mere
want
and
distress
they
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
good
reason
indeed
why
the
people
of
Walthamstow
should
be
very
cautious
,
and
why
they
should
resolve
not
to
entertain
anybody
that
they
be
not
well
satisfied
of
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
Richard
the
joiner
and
one
of
the
other
man
who
parley
with
them
tell
them
,
it
be
no
reason
why
they
should
block
up
the
road
and
refuse
to
let
people
pass
through
the
town
,
and
who
ask
nothing
of
them
but
to
go
through
the
street
;
that
if
their
people
be
afraid
of
them
,
they
may
go
into
their
house
and
shut
their
door
;
they
would
neither
show
them
civility
nor
incivility
,
but
go
on
about
their
business
.
  
<EOS>
the
constable
and
attendant
,
not
to
be
persuade
by
reason
,
continued
obstinate
,
and
would
hearken
to
nothing
;
so
the
two
man
that
talk
with
them
go
back
to
their
fellow
to
consult
what
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
discouraging
in
the
whole
,
and
they
know
not
what
to
do
for
a
good
while
;
but
at
last
John
the
soldier
and
biscuit
-
maker
,
consider
a
while
,
"
come
,
"
say
he
,
"
leave
the
rest
of
the
parley
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
not
appear
yet
,
so
he
set
the
joiner
,
Richard
,
to
work
to
cut
some
pole
out
of
the
tree
and
shape
them
as
like
gun
as
he
could
,
and
in
a
little
time
he
have
five
or
six
fair
musket
,
which
at
a
distance
would
not
be
know
;
and
about
the
part
where
the
lock
of
a
gun
be
he
cause
them
to
wrap
cloth
and
rag
such
as
they
have
,
as
soldier
do
in
wet
weather
to
preserve
the
lock
of
their
piece
from
rust
;
the
rest
be
discolour
with
clay
or
mud
,
such
as
they
could
get
;
and
all
this
while
the
rest
of
them
sit
under
the
tree
by
his
direction
,
in
two
or
three
body
,
where
they
make
fire
at
a
good
distance
from
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
while
this
be
do
he
advance
himself
and
two
or
three
with
him
,
and
set
up
their
tent
in
the
lane
within
sight
of
the
barrier
which
the
town
's
man
have
make
,
and
set
a
sentinel
just
by
it
with
the
real
gun
,
the
only
one
they
have
,
and
who
walk
to
and
fro
with
the
gun
on
his
shoulder
,
so
as
that
the
people
of
the
town
may
see
them
.
<EOS>
also
,
he
tie
the
horse
to
a
gate
in
the
hedge
just
by
,
and
get
some
dry
stick
together
and
kindle
a
fire
on
the
other
side
of
the
tent
,
so
that
the
people
of
the
town
could
see
the
fire
and
the
smoke
,
but
could
not
see
what
they
be
do
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
country
people
have
look
upon
them
very
earnestly
a
great
while
,
and
,
by
all
that
they
could
see
,
could
not
but
suppose
that
they
be
a
great
many
in
company
,
they
begin
to
be
uneasy
,
not
for
their
go
away
,
but
for
stay
where
they
be
;
and
above
all
,
perceive
they
have
horse
and
arm
,
for
they
have
see
one
horse
and
one
gun
at
the
tent
,
and
they
have
see
other
of
them
walk
about
the
field
on
the
inside
of
the
hedge
by
the
side
of
the
lane
with
their
musket
,
as
they
take
them
to
be
,
shoulder
;
I
say
,
upon
such
a
sight
as
this
,
you
may
be
assure
they
be
alarm
and
terribly
fright
,
and
it
seem
they
go
to
a
justice
of
the
peace
to
know
what
they
should
do
.
<EOS>
what
the
justice
advise
them
to
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
but
towards
the
evening
they
call
from
the
barrier
,
as
above
,
to
the
sentinel
at
the
tent
.
  
<EOS>
"

John

<EOS>
John

<EOS>
why
do
you
stop
us
on

pretend
to
refuse
us
leave
to
go
on
our

<EOS>
We
be
not
bind

tell
you
our
reason

though
we
do
let
you
know
it
be
because
of
the
plague
.
  
<EOS>
John
.
<EOS>
We
tell
you
we
be
all
sound
and
free
from
the
plague
,
which
we
be
not

satisfy
you
of
,
and
yet
you
pretend
to
stop
us
on
the
highway

<EOS>

<EOS>
We
have
a
right
to
stop
it
up
,
and
our
own
safety
oblige
us
to
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
this
be
not
the
king
's

;
'
tis
a
way
upon
sufferance
.
<EOS>
You
see
here
be
a
gate
,
and
if
we
do
let
people
pass
here
,
we
make
them
pay
toll
.
  
<EOS>
John

<EOS>
We
have
a
right
to
seek
our
own
safety
as
well
as
you
,
and
you
may
see
we
be
fly
for
our
life
:
and
'
tis
very
unchristian
and
unjust
to
stop
us
.
  
<EOS>
constable
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
back
from
whence
<EOS>
you
come
;
we
do
not
hinder
you
from
that
.
  
<EOS>
John

<EOS>
no

it
be
a
strong
enemy
than
you

keep

from
do
that

we

<EOS>

<EOS>
well

you
may
go
any
other
way
,
then
.
  
<EOS>
John

<EOS>
no

no

I
suppose
you
see
we
be
able
to
send
you
go
,
and
all
the
people
of
your
parish
,
and
come
through
your

when
we
will

but
since
you
have
stop
us
here

we
be
content

<EOS>
You
see
we
have
encamp
here

here
we
will
live

We
hope
you
will
furnish

with
victual

It

step
out

the

order
Captain
Richard
and
his
people
to
march
the
low
way
on
the
side
of
the
marche
,
and
meet
them
in
the
forest
;
which
be
all
a
sham
,
for
they
have
no
Captain
Richard
,
or
any
such
company
.

<EOS>
They
be
soon
make
sensible
of
this
,
for
two
day
afterwards
they
find
several
party
of
horseman
and
footman
also
about
,
in
pursuit
of
three
company
of
man
,
arm
,
as
they
say
,
with
musket
,
who
be
break
out
from
London
and
have
the
plague
upon
them
,
and
that
be
not
only
spread
the
distemper
among
the
people
,
but
plunder
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
see
now
the
consequence
of
their
case
,
they
soon
see
the
danger
they
be
in
;
so
they
resolve
by
the
advice
also
of
the
old
soldier
to
divide
themselves
again
.
<EOS>
John
and
his
two
comrade
,
with
the
horse
,
go
away
,
as
if
towards
Waltham
;
the
other
in
two
company
,
but
all
a
little
asunder
,
and
go
towards
Epping
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
night
they
encamp
all
in
the
forest
,
and
not
far
off
of
one
another
,
but
not
set
up
the
tent
,
lest
that
should
discover
them
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
Richard
go
to
work
with
his
axe
and
his
hatchet
,
and
cut
down
branch
of
tree
,
he
build
three
tent
or
hovel
,
in
which
they
all
encamp
with
as
much
convenience
as
they
could
expect
.
  
<EOS>
the
provision
they
have
at
Walthamstow
serve
them
very
plentifully
this
night
;
and
as
for
the
next
,
they
leave
it
to
Providence
.
<EOS>
They
have
fare
so
well
with
the
old
soldier
's
conduct
that
they
now
willingly
make
him
their
leader
,
and
the
first
of
his
conduct
appear
to
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
He
tell
them
that
they
be
now
at
a
proper
distance
enough
from
London
;
that
as
they
need
not
be
immediately
behold
to
the
country
for
relief
,
so
they
ought
to
be
as
careful
the
country
do
not
infect
them
as
that
they
do
not
infect
the
country
;
that
what
little
money
they
have
,
they
must
be
as
frugal
of
as
they
could
;
that
as
he
would
not
have
them
think
of
offer
the
country
any
violence
,
so
they
must
endeavour
to
make
the
sense
of
their
condition
go
as
far
with
the
country
as
it
could
.
<EOS>
They
all
refer
themselves
to
his
direction
,
so
they
leave
their
three
house
stand
,
and
the
next
day
go
away
towards
Epping
.
<EOS>
the
captain
also
(
for
so
they
now
call
him
)
,
and
his
two
fellow
-
traveller
,
lay
aside
their
design
of
go
to
Waltham
,
and
all
go
together
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
near
Epping
they
halt
,
choose
out
a
proper
place
in
the
open
forest
,
not
very
near
the
highway
,
but
not
far
out
of
it
on
the
north
side
,
under
a
little
cluster
of
low
pollard
-
tree
.
<EOS>
here
they
pitch
their
little
camp
 
which
consist
of
three
large
tent
or
hut
make
of
pole
which
their
carpenter
,
and
such
as
be
his
assistant
,
cut
down
and
fix
in
the
ground
in
a
circle
,
bind
all
the
small
end
together
at
the
top
and
thicken
the
side
with
bough
of
tree
and
bush
,
so
that
they
be
completely
close
and
warm
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
besides
this
,
a
little
tent
where
the
woman
lie
by
themselves
,
and
a
hut
to
put
the
horse
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
the
next
day
,
or
next
but
one
,
be
market
-
day
at
Epping
,
when
Captain
John
and
one
of
the
other
man
go
to
market
and
buy
some
provision
;
that
be
to
say
,
bread
,
and
some
mutton
and
beef
;
and
two
of
the
woman
go
separately
,
as
if
they
have
not
belong
to
the
rest
,
and
buy
more
.
<EOS>
John
take
the
horse
to
bring
it
home
,
and
the
sack
which
the
carpenter
carry
his
tool
in
,
to
put
it
in
.
<EOS>
the
carpenter
go
to
work
and
make
them
bench
and
stool
to
sit
on
,
such
as
the
wood
he
could
get
would
afford
,
and
a
kind
of
table
to
dine
on
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
take
no
notice
of
for
two
or
three
day
,
but
after
that
abundance
of
people
run
out
of
the
town
to
look
at
them
,
and
all
the
country
be
alarm
about
them
.
<EOS>
the
people
at
first
seem
afraid
to
come
near
them
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
desire
the
people
to
keep
off
,
for
there
be
a
rumour
that
the
plague
be
at
Waltham
,
and
that
it
have
be
in
eppe
two
or
three
day
;
so
John
call
out
to
them
not
to
come
to
them
,
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
be
all
whole
and
sound
people
here
,
and
we
would
not
have
you
bring
the
plague
among
us
,
nor
pretend
we
bring
it
among
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
the
parish
officer
come
up
to
them
and
parley
with
them
at
a
distance
,
and
desire
to
know
who
they
be
,
and
by
what
authority
they
pretend
to
fix
their
stand
at
that
place
.
<EOS>
John
answer
very
frankly
,
they
be
poor
distressed
people
from
London
who
,
foresee
the
misery
they
should
be
reduce
to
if
plague
spread
into
the
city
,
have
flee
out
in
time
for
their
life
,
and
,
have
no
acquaintance
or
relation
to
fly
to
,
have
first
take
up
at
Islington
;
but
,
the
plague
be
come
into
that
town
,
be
flee
farther
;
and
as
they
suppose
that
the
people
of
Epping
may
have
refuse
them
come
into
their
town
,
they
have
pitch
their
tent
thus
in
the
open
field
and
in
the
forest
,
be
willing
to
bear
all
the
hardship
of
such
a
disconsolate
lodging
rather
than
have
any
one
think
or
be
afraid
that
they
should
receive
injury
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
the
eppe
people
talk
roughly
to
them
,
and
tell
them
they
must
remove
;
that
this
be
no
place
for
them
;
and
that
they
pretend
to
be
sound
and
well
,
but
that
they
may
be
infect
with
the
plague
for
aught
they
know
,
and
may
infect
the
whole
country
,
and
they
could
not
suffer
them
there
.
  
<EOS>
John
argue
very
calmly
with
them
a
great
while
,
and
tell
them
that
London
be
the
place
by
which
they
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
the
townsman
of
Epping
and
all
the
country
round
them
 
subsist
;
to
whom
they
sell
the
produce
of
their
land
,
and
out
of
whom
they
make
their
rent
of
their
farm
;
and
to
be
so
cruel
to
the
inhabitant
of
London
,
or
to
any
of
those
by
whom
they
gain
so
much
,
be
very
hard
,
and
they
would
be
loth
to
have
it
remember
hereafter
,
and
have
it
tell
how
barbarous
,
how
inhospitable
,
and
how
unkind
they
be
to
the
people
of
London
when
they
flee
from
the
face
of
the
most
terrible
enemy
in
the
world
;
that
it
would
be
enough
to
make
the
name
of
an
epping
man
hateful
through
all
the
city
,
and
to
have
the
rabble
stone
them
in
the
very
street
whenever
they
come
so
much
as
to
market
;
that
they
be
not
yet
secure
from
be
visit
themselves
,
and
that
,
as
he
hear
,
Waltham
be
already
;
that
they
would
think
it
very
hard
that
when
any
of
them
flee
for
fear
before
they
be
touch
,
they
should
be
deny
the
liberty
of
lie
so
much
as
in
the
open
field
.
  
<EOS>
the
Epping
man
tell
them
again
,
that
they
,
indeed
,
say
they
be
sound
and
free
from
the
infection
,
but
that
they
have
no
assurance
of
it
;
and
that
it
be
report
that
there
have
be
a
great
rabble
of
people
at
Walthamstow
,
who
make
such
pretence
of
be
sound
as
they
do
,
but
that
they
threaten
to
plunder
the
town
and
force
their
way
,
whether
the
parish
officer
would
or
no
;
that
there
be
near
two
hundred
of
them
,
and
have
arm
and
tent
like
Low
Country
soldier
;
that
they
extort
provision
from
the
town
,
by
threaten
them
with
live
upon
them
at
free
quarter
,
show
their
arm
,
and
talk
in
the
language
of
soldier
;
and
that
several
of
them
be
go
away
toward
Rumford
and
Brentwood
,
the
country
have
be
infect
by
them
,
and
the
plague
spread
into
both
those
large
town
,
so
that
the
people
durst
not
go
to
market
there
as
usual
;
that
it
be
very
likely
they
be
some
of
that
party
;
and
if
so
,
they
deserve
to
be
send
to
the
county
jail
,
and
be
secure
till
they
have
make
satisfaction
for
the
damage
they
have
do
,
and
for
the
terror
and
fright
they
have
put
the
country
into
.
  
<EOS>
John
answer
that
what
other
people
have
do
be
nothing
to
them
;
that
they
assure
them
they
be
all
of
one
company
;
that
they
have
never
be
more
in
number
than
they
see
them
at
that
time
(
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
very
true
)
;
that
they
come
out
in
two
separate
company
,
but
join
by
the
way
,
their
case
be
the
same
;
that
they
be
ready
to
give
what
account
of
themselves
<EOS>
anybody
could
desire
of
them
,
and
to
give
in
their
name
and
place
of
abode
,
that
so
they
may
be
call
to
an
account
for
any
disorder
that
they
may
be
guilty
of
;
that
the
townsman
may
see
they
be
content
to
live
hardly
,
and
only
desire
a
little
room
to
breathe
in
on
the
forest
where
it
be
wholesome
;
for
where
it
be
not
they
could
not
stay
,
and
would
decamp
if
they
find
it
otherwise
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
the
townsman
,
"
we
have
a
great
charge
of
poor
upon
our
hand
already
,
and
we
must
take
care
not
to
increase
it
;
we
suppose
you
can
give
us
no
security
against
your
be
chargeable
to
our
parish
and
to
the
inhabitant
,
any
more
than
you
can
of
be
dangerous
to
us
as
to
the
infection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
look
you
,
"
say
John
,
"
<EOS>
as
to
be
chargeable
to
you
,
we
hope
we
shall
not
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
relieve
us
with
provision
for
our
present
necessity
,
we
will
be
very
thankful
;
as
we
all
live
without
charity
when
we
be
at
home
,
so
we
will
oblige
ourselves
fully
to
repay
you
,
if
God
please
to
bring
us
back
to
our
own
family
and
house
in
safety
,
and
to
restore
health
to
the
people
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
our
dying
here
:
we
assure
you
,
if
any
of
us
die
,
we
that
survive
will
bury
them
,
and
put
you
to
no
expense
,
except
it
should
be
that
we
should
all
die
;
and
then
,
indeed
,
the
last
man
not
be
able
to
bury
himself
,
would
put
you
to
that
single
expense
which
I
be
persuade
"
,
say
John
,
"
he
would
leave
enough
behind
him
to
pay
you
for
the
expense
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
other
hand
,
"
say
John
,
"
if
you
shut
up
all
bowel
of
compassion
,
and
not
relieve
us
at
all
,
we
shall
not
extort
anything
by
violence
or
steal
from
any
one
;
but
when
what
little
we
have
be
spend
,
if
we
perish
for
want
,
God
's
will
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
work
so
upon
the
townsman
,
by
talk
thus
rationally
and
smoothly
to
them
,
that
they
go
away
;
and
though
they
do
not
give
any
consent
to
their
staying
there
,
yet
they
do
not
molest
them
;
and
the
poor
people
continue
there
three
or
four
day
longer
without
any
disturbance
.
<EOS>
in
this
time
they
have
get
some
remote
acquaintance
with
a
victual
-
house
at
the
outskirt
of
the
town
,
to
whom
they
call
at
a
distance
to
bring
some
little
thing
that
they
want
,
and
which
they
cause
to
be
set
down
at
a
distance
,
and
always
pay
for
very
honestly
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
time
the
young
people
of
the
town
come
frequently
pretty
near
them
,
and
would
stand
and
look
at
them
,
and
sometimes
talk
with
them
at
some
space
between
;
and
particularly
it
be
observe
that
the
first
Sabbath
-
day
the
poor
people
keep
retire
,
worship
God
together
,
and
be
hear
to
sing
psalm
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
,
and
a
quiet
,
inoffensive
behaviour
,
begin
to
get
them
the
good
opinion
of
the
country
,
and
people
begin
to
pity
them
and
speak
very
well
of
them
;
the
consequence
of
which
be
,
that
upon
the
occasion
of
a
very
wet
,
rainy
night
,
a
certain
gentleman
who
live
in
the
neighbourhood
send
them
a
little
cart
with
twelve
truss
or
bundle
of
straw
,
as
well
for
them
to
lodge
upon
as
to
cover
and
thatch
their
hut
and
to
keep
them
dry
.
<EOS>
the
minister
of
a
parish
not
far
off
,
not
know
of
the
other
,
send
them
also
about
two
bushel
of
wheat
and
half
a
bushel
of
white
pea
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
very
thankful
,
to
be
sure
,
for
this
relief
,
and
particularly
the
straw
be
a
 
very
great
comfort
to
them
;
for
though
the
ingenious
carpenter
have
make
frame
for
them
to
lie
in
like
trough
,
and
fill
them
with
leave
of
tree
,
and
such
thing
as
they
could
get
,
and
have
cut
all
their
tent
-
cloth
out
to
make
them
coverlid
,
yet
they
lay
damp
and
hard
and
unwholesome
till
this
straw
come
,
which
be
to
them
like
feather
-
bed
,
and
,
as
John
say
,
more
welcome
than
<EOS>
feather
-
bed
would
have
be
at
another
time
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
and
the
minister
have
thus
begin
,
and
give
an
example
of
charity
to
these
wanderer
,
other
quickly
follow
,
and
they
receive
every
day
some
benevolence
or
other
from
the
people
,
but
chiefly
from
the
gentleman
who
dwelt
in
the
country
round
them
.
<EOS>
some
send
them
chair
,
stool
,
table
,
and
such
household
thing
as
they
give
notice
they
want
;
some
send
them
blanket
,
rug
,
and
coverlid
,
some
earthenware
,
and
some
kitchen
ware
for
order
their
food
.
  
<EOS>
encourage
by
this
good
usage
,
their
carpenter
in
a
few
day
build
them
a
large
shed
or
house
with
rafter
,
and
a
roof
in
form
,
and
an
upper
floor
,
in
which
they
lodge
warm
:
for
the
weather
begin
to
be
damp
and
cold
in
the
beginning
of
September
.
<EOS>
but
this
house
,
be
well
thatch
,
and
the
side
and
roof
make
very
thick
,
keep
out
the
cold
well
enough
.
<EOS>
He
make
,
also
,
an
earthen
wall
at
one
end
with
a
chimney
in
it
,
and
another
of
the
company
,
with
a
vast
deal
of
trouble
and
pain
,
make
a
funnel
to
the
chimney
to
carry
out
the
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
live
comfortably
,
though
coarsely
,
till
the
beginning
of
September
,
when
they
have
the
bad
news
to
hear
,
whether
true
or
not
,
that
the
plague
,
which
be
very
hot
at
Waltham
Abbey
on
one
side
and
at
Rumford
and
Brentwood
on
the
other
side
,
be
also
come
to
Epping
,
to
Woodford
,
and
to
most
of
the
town
upon
the
Forest
,
and
which
,
as
they
say
,
be
bring
down
among
them
chiefly
by
the
higler
,
and
such
people
as
go
to
and
from
London
with
provision
.
  
<EOS>
if
this
be
true
,
it
be
an
evident
contradiction
to
that
report
which
be
afterwards
spread
all
over
England
,
but
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
can
not
confirm
of
my
own
knowledge
:
namely
,
that
the
market
-
people
carry
provision
to
the
city
never
get
the
infection
or
carry
it
back
into
the
country
;
both
which
,
I
have
be
assure
,
have
be
false
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
they
be
preserve
even
beyond
expectation
,
though
not
to
a
miracle
,
that
abundance
go
and
come
and
be
not
touch
;
and
that
be
much
for
the
encouragement
of
the
poor
people
of
London
,
who
have
be
completely
miserable
if
the
people
that
bring
provision
to
the
market
have
not
be
many
time
wonderfully
preserve
,
or
at
least
more
preserve
than
could
be
reasonably
expect
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
these
new
inmate
begin
to
be
disturb
more
effectually
,
for
the
town
about
them
be
really
infect
,
and
they
begin
to
be
afraid
to
trust
one
another
so
much
as
to
go
abroad
for
such
thing
as
they
want
,
and
this
pinch
them
very
hard
,
for
now
they
have
little
or
nothing
but
what
the
charitable
gentleman
of
the
country
supply
them
with
.
<EOS>
but
,
for
their
encouragement
,
it
happen
that
other
gentleman
in
the
country
who
have
not
send
them
anything
before
,
begin
to
hear
of
them
and
supply
them
,
and
one
send
them
a
large
pig
 
that
be
to
say
,
a
porker
another
two
sheep
,
and
another
send
them
a
calf
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
they
have
meat
enough
,
and
sometimes
have
cheese
and
milk
,
and
all
such
thing
.
<EOS>
They
be
chiefly
put
to
it
for
bread
,
for
when
the
gentleman
send
them
corn
<EOS>
they
have
nowhere
to
bake
it
or
to
grind
it
.
<EOS>
this
make
them
eat
the
first
two
bushel
of
wheat
that
be
send
them
in
parched
corn
,
as
the
Israelites
of
old
do
,
without
grind
or
make
bread
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
they
find
mean
to
carry
their
corn
to
a
windmill
near
Woodford
,
where
they
have
it
grind
,
and
afterwards
the
biscuit
-
maker
make
a
hearth
so
hollow
and
dry
that
he
could
bake
biscuit
-
cake
tolerably
well
;
and
thus
they
come
into
a
condition
to
live
without
any
assistance
or
supply
from
the
town
;
and
it
be
well
<EOS>
they
do
,
for
the
country
<EOS>
be
soon
after
fully
infect
,
and
about
120
be
say
to
have
die
of
the
distemper
in
the
village
near
them
,
which
be
a
terrible
thing
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
they
call
a
new
council
,
and
now
the
town
have
no
need
to
be
afraid
they
should
settle
near
them
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
several
family
of
the
poor
sort
of
the
inhabitant
quit
their
house
and
build
hut
in
the
forest
after
the
same
manner
as
they
have
do
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
observe
that
several
of
these
poor
people
that
have
so
remove
have
the
sickness
even
in
their
hut
or
booth
;
the
reason
of
which
be
plain
,
namely
,
not
because
they
remove
into
the
air
,
but
,
(
)
because
they
do
not
remove
time
enough
;
that
be
to
say
,
not
till
,
by
openly
converse
with
the
other
people
their
neighbour
,
they
have
the
distemper
upon
them
,
or
(
as
may
be
say
)
among
them
,
and
so
carry
it
about
them
<EOS>
whither
they
go
.
<EOS>
or
(
2
)
because
they
be
not
careful
enough
,
after
they
be
safely
remove
out
of
the
town
,
not
to
come
in
again
and
mingle
with
the
diseased
people
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
it
<EOS>
which
of
these
it
will
,
when
our
traveller
begin
to
perceive
that
the
plague
be
not
only
in
the
town
,
but
even
in
the
tent
and
hut
on
the
forest
near
them
,
they
begin
then
not
only
to
be
afraid
,
but
to
think
of
decamp
and
remove
;
for
have
they
stay
they
would
have
be
in
manifest
danger
of
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
wonder
that
they
be
greatly
afflict
at
be
oblige
to
quit
the
place
where
they
have
be
so
kindly
receive
,
and
where
they
have
be
treat
with
so
much
humanity
and
charity
;
but
necessity
and
the
hazard
of
life
,
which
they
come
out
so
far
to
preserve
,
prevail
with
them
,
and
they
see
no
remedy
.
<EOS>
John
,
however
,
think
of
a
remedy
for
their
present
misfortune
:
<EOS>
namely
,
that
he
would
first
acquaint
that
gentleman
who
be
their
principal
benefactor
with
the
distress
they
be
in
,
and
to
crave
his
assistance
and
advice
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
,
charitable
gentleman
encourage
them
to
quit
the
place
for
fear
they
should
be
cut
off
from
any
retreat
at
all
by
the
violence
of
the
distemper
;
but
whither
they
should
go
,
that
he
find
very
hard
to
direct
them
to
.
<EOS>
at
last
John
ask
of
him
whether
he
,
be
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
would
give
them
certificate
of
health
to
other
justice
whom
they
may
come
before
;
that
so
whatever
may
be
their
lot
,
they
may
not
be
repulse
now
<EOS>
they
have
be
also
so
long
from
London
.
<EOS>
this
his
worship
immediately
grant
,
and
give
them
proper
letter
of
health
,
and
from
thence
they
be
at
liberty
to
travel
whither
they
please
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
they
have
a
full
certificate
of
health
,
intimate
that
they
have
reside
in
a
village
in
the
county
of
Essex
<EOS>
so
long
that
,
be
examine
and
scrutinise
sufficiently
,
and
have
be
retire
from
all
conversation
for
above
forty
day
,
without
any
appearance
of
sickness
,
they
be
therefore
certainly
conclude
to
be
sound
man
,
and
may
be
safely
entertain
anywhere
,
have
at
last
remove
rather
for
fear
of
the
plague
which
be
come
into
such
a
town
,
rather
than
for
have
any
signal
of
infection
upon
them
,
or
upon
any
belonging
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
certificate
they
remove
,
though
with
great
reluctance
;
and
John
incline
not
to
go
far
from
home
,
they
move
towards
the
marsh
on
the
side
of
Waltham
.
<EOS>
but
here
they
find
a
man
who
,
it
seem
,
keep
a
weir
or
stop
upon
the
river
,
make
to
raise
the
water
for
the
barge
which
go
up
and
down
the
river
,
and
he
terrify
them
with
dismal
story
of
the
sickness
have
be
spread
into
all
the
town
on
the
river
and
near
the
river
,
on
the
side
of
Middlesex
and
Hertfordshire
;
that
be
to
say
,
into
Waltham
,
Waltham
Cross
,
Enfield
,
and
Ware
,
and
all
the
town
on
the
road
,
that
they
be
afraid
to
go
that
way
;
though
it
seem
the
man
impose
upon
them
,
for
that
the
thing
be
not
really
true
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
terrify
them
,
and
they
resolve
to
move
across
the
forest
towards
Rumford
and
Brentwood
;
but
they
hear
that
there
be
number
of
people
flee
out
of
London
that
way
,
who
lie
up
and
down
in
the
forest
call
Henalt
Forest
,
reach
near
Rumford
,
and
who
,
have
no
subsistence
or
habitation
,
not
only
live
oddly
and
suffer
great
extremity
in
the
wood
and
field
for
want
of
relief
,
but
be
say
to
be
make
so
desperate
by
those
extremity
as
that
they
offer
many
violence
to
the
county
rob
and
plunder
,
and
kill
cattle
,
and
the
like
;
that
other
,
build
hut
and
hovel
by
the
roadside
,
beg
,
and
that
with
an
importunity
next
door
to
demand
relief
;
so
that
the
county
be
very
uneasy
,
and
have
be
oblige
to
take
some
of
them
up
.
  
<EOS>
this
in
the
first
place
intimate
to
them
,
that
they
would
be
sure
to
find
the
charity
and
kindness
of
the
county
,
which
they
have
find
here
where
they
be
before
,
harden
and
shut
up
against
them
;
and
that
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
would
be
question
wherever
they
come
,
and
would
be
in
danger
of
violence
from
other
in
like
case
as
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
upon
all
these
consideration
John
,
their
captain
,
in
all
their
name
,
go
back
to
their
good
friend
and
benefactor
,
who
have
relieve
them
before
,
and
lay
their
case
truly
before
him
,
humbly
ask
his
advice
;
and
he
as
kindly
advise
them
to
take
up
their
old
quarter
again
,
or
if
not
,
to
remove
but
a
little
farther
out
of
the
road
,
and
direct
them
to
a
proper
place
for
them
;
and
as
they
really
want
some
house
rather
than
hut
to
shelter
them
at
that
time
of
the
year
,
it
grow
on
towards
Michaelmas
<EOS>
,
they
find
an
old
decayed
house
which
have
be
formerly
some
cottage
or
little
habitation
but
be
so
out
of
repair
as
scarce
habitable
;
and
by
the
consent
of
a
farmer
to
whose
farm
<EOS>
it
belong
,
they
get
leave
to
make
what
use
of
it
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
the
ingenious
joiner
,
and
all
the
rest
,
by
his
direction
go
to
work
with
it
,
and
in
a
very
few
day
make
it
capable
to
shelter
them
all
in
case
of
bad
weather
;
and
in
which
there
be
an
old
chimney
and
old
oven
,
though
both
lying
in
ruin
;
yet
they
make
them
both
fit
for
use
,
and
,
raise
addition
,
shed
,
and
leanto
on
every
side
,
they
soon
make
the
house
capable
to
hold
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
They
chiefly
want
board
to
make
window
-
shutter
,
floor
,
door
,
and
several
other
thing
;
but
as
the
gentleman
above
favour
them
,
and
the
country
be
by
that
mean
make
easy
with
them
,
and
above
all
,
that
they
be
know
to
be
all
sound
and
in
good
health
,
everybody
help
them
with
what
they
could
spare
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
encamp
for
good
and
all
,
and
resolve
to
remove
no
more
.
<EOS>
They
see
plainly
how
terribly
alarm
that
county
be
everywhere
at
anybody
that
come
from
London
,
and
that
they
should
have
no
admittance
anywhere
but
with
the
utmost
difficulty
;
at
least
no
friendly
reception
and
assistance
as
they
have
receive
here
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
although
they
receive
great
assistance
and
encouragement
from
the
country
gentleman
and
from
the
people
round
about
them
,
yet
they
be
put
to
great
strait
:
for
the
weather
grow
cold
and
wet
in
October
and
November
,
and
they
have
not
be
use
to
so
much
hardship
;
so
that
they
get
cold
in
their
limb
,
and
distemper
,
but
never
have
the
infection
;
and
thus
about
December
they
come
home
to
the
city
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
this
story
thus
at
large
,
principally
to
give
an
account
<EOS>
what
become
of
the
great
number
of
people
which
immediately
appear
in
the
city
as
soon
as
the
sickness
abate
;
for
,
as
I
have
say
,
great
number
of
those
that
be
able
and
have
retreat
in
the
country
flee
to
those
retreat
.
<EOS>
so
,
when
it
be
increase
to
such
a
frightful
extremity
as
I
have
relate
,
the
middling
people
who
have
not
friend
flee
to
all
part
of
the
country
where
they
could
get
shelter
,
as
well
those
that
have
money
to
relieve
themselves
as
those
that
have
not
.
<EOS>
those
that
have
money
always
flee
farth
,
because
they
be
able
to
subsist
themselves
;
but
those
who
be
empty
suffer
,
as
I
have
say
,
great
hardship
,
and
be
often
drive
by
necessity
to
relieve
their
want
at
the
expense
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
by
that
mean
the
country
be
make
very
uneasy
at
them
,
and
sometimes
take
them
up
;
though
even
then
they
scarce
know
what
to
do
with
them
,
and
be
always
very
backward
to
punish
them
,
but
often
,
too
,
they
force
them
from
place
to
place
till
they
be
oblige
to
come
back
again
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
since
my
knowing
this
story
of
John
and
his
brother
,
inquire
and
find
that
there
be
a
great
many
of
the
poor
disconsolate
people
,
as
above
,
flee
into
the
country
every
way
;
and
some
of
them
get
little
shed
and
barn
and
outhouse
to
live
in
,
where
they
could
obtain
so
much
kindness
of
the
country
,
and
especially
where
they
have
any
the
least
satisfactory
account
to
give
of
themselves
,
and
particularly
that
they
do
not
come
out
of
London
too
late
.
<EOS>
but
other
,
and
that
in
great
number
,
build
themselves
little
hut
and
retreat
in
the
field
and
wood
,
and
live
like
hermit
in
hole
and
cave
,
or
any
place
they
could
find
,
and
where
,
we
may
be
sure
,
they
suffer
great
extremity
,
such
that
many
of
them
be
oblige
to
come
back
again
whatever
the
danger
be
;
and
so
those
little
hut
be
often
find
empty
,
and
the
country
people
suppose
the
inhabitant
lie
dead
in
them
of
the
plague
,
and
would
not
go
near
them
for
fear
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
in
a
great
while
;
nor
be
it
unlikely
but
that
some
of
the
unhappy
wanderer
may
die
so
all
alone
,
even
sometimes
for
want
of
help
,
as
particularly
in
one
tent
or
hut
be
find
a
man
dead
,
and
on
the
gate
of
a
field
just
by
be
cut
with
his
knife
in
uneven
letter
the
follow
word
,
by
which
it
may
be
suppose
the
other
man
escape
,
or
that
,
one
die
first
,
the
other
bury
him
as
well
as
he
could
:
     
o
mIsErY
!
<EOS>
We
both
<EOS>
ShaLL
DyE
,
woe
,
WoE.
  
<EOS>
I
have
give
an
account
already
of
what
I
find
to
have
be
the
case
down
the
river
among
the
seafare
man
;
how
the
ship
lie
in
the
offing
,
as
it
be
call
,
in
row
or
line
astern
of
one
another
,
quite
down
from
the
Pool
as
far
as
I
could
see
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
tell
that
they
lie
in
the
same
manner
quite
down
the
river
as
low
as
Gravesend
,
and
some
far
beyond
:
even
everywhere
or
in
every
place
where
they
could
ride
with
safety
as
to
wind
and
weather
;
nor
do
I
ever
hear
that
the
plague
reach
to
any
of
the
people
on
board
those
ship
 
except
such
as
lie
up
in
the
Pool
,
or
as
high
as
Deptford
Reach
,
although
the
people
go
frequently
on
shore
to
the
country
town
and
village
and
farmer
'
house
,
to
buy
fresh
provision
,
fowl
,
pig
,
calf
,
and
the
like
for
their
supply
.
  
<EOS>
likewise
I
find
that
the
waterman
on
the
river
above
the
bridge
find
mean
to
convey
themselves
away
up
the
river
as
far
as
they
could
go
,
and
that
they
have
,
many
of
them
,
their
whole
family
in
their
boat
,
cover
with
tilt
and
bale
,
as
they
call
them
,
and
furnish
with
straw
within
for
their
lodging
,
and
that
they
lie
thus
all
along
by
the
shore
in
the
marsh
,
some
of
them
set
up
little
tent
with
their
sail
,
and
so
lie
under
them
on
shore
in
the
day
,
and
go
into
their
boat
at
night
;
and
in
this
manner
,
as
I
have
hear
,
the
river
-
side
be
line
with
boat
and
people
as
long
as
they
have
anything
to
subsist
on
,
or
could
get
anything
of
the
country
;
and
indeed
the
country
people
,
as
well
Gentlemen
as
other
,
on
these
and
all
other
occasion
,
be
very
forward
to
relieve
them
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
by
no
mean
willing
to
receive
them
into
their
town
and
house
,
and
<EOS>
for
that
we
can
not
blame
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
unhappy
citizen
within
my
knowledge
who
have
be
visit
in
a
dreadful
manner
,
so
that
his
wife
and
all
his
child
be
dead
,
and
himself
and
two
servant
only
leave
,
with
an
elderly
woman
,
a
near
relation
,
who
have
nurse
those
that
be
dead
as
well
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
this
disconsolate
man
go
to
a
village
near
the
town
,
though
not
within
the
bill
of
mortality
,
and
find
an
empty
house
there
,
inquire
out
the
owner
,
and
take
the
house
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
day
he
get
a
cart
and
load
it
with
good
,
and
carry
them
down
to
the
house
;
the
people
of
the
village
oppose
his
drive
the
cart
along
;
but
with
some
arguing
and
some
force
,
the
man
that
drive
the
cart
along
get
through
the
street
up
to
the
door
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
there
the
constable
resist
them
again
,
and
would
not
let
them
be
bring
in
.
<EOS>
the
man
cause
the
good
to
be
unloaden
and
lay
at
the
door
,
and
send
the
cart
away
;
upon
which
they
carry
the
man
before
a
justice
of
peace
;
that
be
to
say
,
they
command
him
to
go
,
which
he
do
.
<EOS>
the
justice
order
him
to
cause
the
cart
to
fetch
away
the
good
again
,
which
he
refuse
to
do
;
upon
which
the
justice
order
the
constable
to
pursue
the
carter
and
fetch
them
back
,
and
make
them
reload
the
good
and
carry
them
away
,
or
to
set
them
in
the
stock
till
they
come
for
further
order
;
and
if
they
could
not
find
them
,
nor
the
man
would
not
consent
to
take
them
away
,
they
should
cause
them
to
be
draw
with
hook
from
the
house
-
door
and
burn
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
poor
distressed
man
upon
this
fetch
the
good
again
,
but
with
grievous
cry
and
lamentation
at
the
hardship
of
his
case
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
remedy
;
self
-
preservation
oblige
the
people
to
those
severity
which
they
would
not
otherwise
have
be
concern
in
.
<EOS>
whether
this
poor
man
live
or
die
I
can
not
tell
,
but
it
be
report
that
he
have
the
plague
upon
him
at
that
time
;
and
perhaps
the
people
may
report
that
to
justify
their
usage
of
him
;
but
it
be
not
unlikely
that
either
he
or
his
good
,
or
both
,
be
dangerous
,
when
his
whole
family
have
be
dead
of
the
distemper
so
little
a
while
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
inhabitant
of
the
town
adjacent
to
London
be
much
blame
for
cruelty
to
the
poor
people
that
run
from
the
contagion
in
their
distress
,
and
many
very
severe
thing
be
do
,
as
may
be
see
from
what
have
be
say
;
but
I
can
not
but
say
also
that
,
where
there
be
room
for
charity
and
assistance
to
the
people
,
without
apparent
danger
to
themselves
,
they
be
willing
enough
to
help
and
relieve
them
.
<EOS>
but
as
every
town
be
indeed
judge
in
their
own
case
,
so
the
poor
people
who
run
abroad
in
their
extremity
be
often
ill
-
use
and
drive
back
again
into
the
town
;
and
this
cause
infinite
exclamation
and
outcry
against
the
country
town
,
and
make
the
clamour
very
popular
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
more
or
less
,
maugre
all
the
caution
,
there
be
not
a
town
of
any
note
within
ten
(
or
,
I
believe
,
twenty
)
mile
of
the

<EOS>
another
thing
may
render
the
country
more
strict
with
respect
to
the
citizen
,
and
especially
with
respect
to
the
poor
,
and
this
be
what
I
hint
at
before
:
namely
,
that
there
be
a
seeming
propensity
or
a
wicked
inclination
in
those
that
be
infect
to
infect
other
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
great
debate
among
our
physician
as
to
the
reason
of
this
.
<EOS>
some
will
have
it
to
be
in
the
nature
of
the
disease
,
and
that
it
impress
every
one
that
be
seize
upon
by
it
with
a
kind
of
a
rage
,
and
a
hatred
against
their
own
kind
 
as
if
there
be
a
malignity
not
only
in
the
distemper
to
communicate
itself
,
but
in
the
very
nature
of
man
,
prompt
him
with
evil
will
or
an
evil
eye
,
that
,
as
they
say
in
the
case
of
a
mad
dog
,
who
though
the
gentle
creature
before
of
any
of
his
kind
,
yet
then
will
fly
upon
and
bite
any
one
that
come
next
him
,
and
those
as
soon
as
any
who
have
be
most
observe
by
him
before
.
  
<EOS>
other
place
it
to
the
account
of
the
corruption
of
human
nature
,
who
can
not
bear
to
see
itself
more
miserable
than
other
of
its
own
specie
,
and
have
a
kind
of
involuntary
wish
that
all
man
be
as
unhappy
or
in
as
bad
a
condition
as
itself
.
  
<EOS>
other
say
it
be
only
a
kind
of
desperation
,
not
know
or
regard
what
they
do
,
and
consequently
unconcerned
at
the
danger
or
safety
not
only
of
anybody
near
them
,
but
even
of
themselves
also
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
when
man
be
once
come
to
a
condition
to
abandon
themselves
,
and
be
unconcerned
for
the
safety
or
at
the
danger
of
themselves
,
it
can
not
be
so
much
wonder
that
they
should
be
careless
of
the
safety
of
other
people
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
choose
to
give
this
grave
debate
a
quite
different
turn
,
and
answer
it
or
resolve
it
all
by
say
that
I
do
not
grant
the
fact
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
say
that
the
thing
be
not
really
so
,
but
that
it
be
a
general
complaint
raise
by
the
people
inhabit
the
outlying
village
against
the
citizen
to
justify
,
or
at
least
excuse
,
those
hardship
and
severity
so
much
talk
of
,
and
in
which
complaint
both
side
may
be
say
to
have
injure
one
another
;
that
be
to
say
,
the
citizen
press
to
be
receive
and
harbour
in
time
of
distress
,
and
with
the
plague
upon
them
,
complain
of
the
cruelty
and
injustice
of
the
country
people
in
be
refuse
entrance
and
force
back
again
with
their
good
and
family
;
and
the
inhabitant
,
find
themselves
so
impose
upon
,
and
the
citizen
break
in
as
it
be
upon
them
whether
they
would
or
no
<EOS>
,
complain
that
when
they
be
infect
they
be
not
only
regardless
of
other
,
but
even
willing
to
infect
them
;
neither
of
which
be
really
true
 
that
be
to
say
,
in
the
colour
they
be
describe
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
there
be
something
to
be
say
for
the
frequent
alarm
which
be
give
to
the
country
of
the
resolution
of
the
people
of
London
to
come
out
by
force
,
not
only
for
relief
,
but
to
plunder
and
rob
;
that
they
run
about
the
street
with
the
distemper
upon
them
without
any
control
;
and
that
no
care
be
take
to
shut
up
house
,
and
confine
the
sick
people
from
infect
other
;
whereas
,
to
do
the
Londoners
justice
,
they
never
practise
such
thing
,
except
in
such
particular
case
as
I
have
mention
above
,
and
such
like
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
everything
be
manage
with
so
much
care
,
and
such
excellent
order
be
observe
in
the
whole
city
and
suburb
by
the
care
of
the
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
and
by
the
justice
of
the
peace
,
church
-
wardens
,
&
c.
,
in
the
outpart
,
that
London
may
be
a
pattern
to
all
the
city
in
the
world
for
the
good
government
and
the
excellent
order
that
be
everywhere
keep
,
even
in
the
time
of
the
most
violent
infection
,
and
when
the
people
be
in
the
utmost
consternation
and
distress
.
<EOS>
but
of
this
I
shall
speak
by
itself
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
,
it
be
to
be
observe
,
be
owe
principally
to
the
prudence
of
the
magistrate
,
and
ought
to
be
mention
to
their
honour
:
viz
.
<EOS>
,
the
moderation
which
they
use
in
the
great
and
difficult
work
of
shut
up
of
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
as
I
have
mention
,
that
the
shutting
up
of
house
be
a
great
subject
of
discontent
,
and
I
may
say
indeed
the
only
subject
of
discontent
among
the
people
at
that
time
;
for
the
confining
the
sound
in
the
same
house
with
the
sick
be
count
very
terrible
,
and
the
complaint
of
people
so
confine
be
very
grievous
.
<EOS>
They
be
hear
into
the
very
street
,
and
they
be
sometimes
such
that
call
for
resentment
,
though
oftener
for
compassion
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
way
to
converse
with
any
of
their
friend
but
out
at
their
window
,
where
they
would
make
such
piteous
lamentation
as
often
move
the
heart
of
those
they
talk
with
,
and
of
other
who
,
pass
by
,
hear
their
story
;
and
as
those
complaint
oftentime
reproach
the
severity
,
and
sometimes
the
insolence
,
of
the
watchman
place
at
their
door
,
those
watchman
would
answer
saucily
enough
,
and
perhaps
be
apt
to
affront
the
people
who
be
in
the
street
talk
to
the
say
family
;
for
which
,
or
for
their
ill
-
treatment
of
the
family
,
I
think
seven
or
eight
of
them
in
several
place
be
kill
;
I
know
not
whether
I
should
say
murder
or
not
,
because
I
can
not
enter
into
the
particular
case
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
the
watchman
be
on
their
duty
,
and
act
in
the
post
where
they
be
place
by
a
lawful
authority
;
and
kill
any
public
legal
officer
in
the
execution
of
his
office
be
always
,
in
the
language
of
the
law
,
call
murder
.
<EOS>
but
as
they
be
not
authorise
by
the
magistrate
'
instruction
,
or
by
the
power
they
act
under
,
to
be
injurious
or
abusive
either
to
the
people
who
be
under
their
observation
or
to
any
that
concern
themselves
for
them
;
so
when
they
do
so
,
they
may
be
say
to
act
themselves
,
not
their
office
;
to
act
as
private
person
,
not
as
person
employ
;
and
consequently
,
if
they
bring
mischief
upon
themselves
by
such
an
undue
behaviour
,
that
mischief
be
upon
their
own
head
;
and
indeed
they
have
so
much
the
hearty
curse
of
the
people
,
whether
they
deserve
it
or
not
,
that
whatever
befall
them
nobody
pity
them
,
and
everybody
be
apt
to
say
they
deserve
it
,
whatever
it
be
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
remember
that
anybody
be
ever
punish
,
at
least
to
any
considerable
degree
,
for
whatever
be
do
to
the
watchman
that
guard
their
house
.
  
<EOS>
what
variety
of
stratagem
be
use
to
escape
and
get
out
of
house
thus
shut
up
,
by
which
the
watchman
be
deceive
or
overpower
,
and
that
the
people
get
away
,
I
have
take
notice
of
already
,
and
shall
say
no
more
to
that
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
the
magistrate
do
moderate
and
ease
family
upon
many
occasion
in
this
case
,
and
particularly
in
that
of
take
away
,
or
suffer
to
be
remove
,
the
sick
person
out
of
such
house
when
they
be
willing
to
be
remove
either
to
a
pest
-
house
or
other
Places
;
and
sometimes
give
the
well
person
in
the
family
so
shut
up
,
leave
to
remove
upon
information
give
that
they
be
well
,
and
that
they
would
confine
themselves
in
such
house
where
they
go
so
long
as
should
be
require
of
them
.
<EOS>
the
concern
,
also
,
of
the
magistrate
for
the
supply
such
poor
family
as
be
infect
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
supply
them
with
necessary
,
as
well
physic
as
food
 
<EOS>
be
very
great
,
and
in
which
they
do
not
content
themselves
with
give
the
necessary
order
to
the
officer
appoint
,
but
the
alderman
in
person
,
and
on
horseback
,
frequently
ride
to
such
house
and
cause
the
people
to
be
ask
at
their
window
whether
they
be
duly
attend
or
not
;
also
,
whether
they
want
anything
that
be
necessary
,
and
if
the
officer
have
constantly
carry
their
message
and
fetch
them
such
thing
as
they
want
or
not
.
<EOS>
and
if
they
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
all
be
well
;
but
if
they
complain
that
they
be
ill
supplied
,
and
that
the
officer
do
not
do
his
duty
,
or
do
not
treat
them
civilly
,
they
(
the
officer
)
be
generally
remove
,
and
other
place
in
their
stead
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
such
complaint
may
be
unjust
,
and
if
the
officer
have
such
argument
to
use
as
would
convince
the
magistrate
that
he
be
right
,
and
that
the
people
have
injure
him
,
he
be
continue
and
they
reprove
.
<EOS>
but
this
part
could
not
well
bear
a
particular
inquiry
,
for
the
party
could
very
ill
be
well
hear
and
answer
in
the
street
from
the
window
,
as
be
the
case
then
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
,
therefore
,
generally
choose
to
favour
the
people
and
remove
the
man
,
as
what
seem
to
be
the
least
wrong
and
of
the
least
ill
consequence
;
see
if
the
watchman
be
injure
,
yet
they
could
easily
make
him
amend
by
give
him
another
post
of
the
like
nature
;
but
if
the
family
be
injure
,
there
be
<EOS>
no
satisfaction
could
be
make
to
them
,
the
damage
perhaps
be
irreparable
,
as
it
concern
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
variety
of
these
case
frequently
happen
between
the
watchmen
and
the
poor
people
shut
up
,
besides
those
I
formerly
mention
about
escape
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
watchman
be
absent
,
sometimes
drunk
,
sometimes
asleep
when
the
people
want
them
,
and
such
never
fail
to
be
punish
severely
,
as
indeed
they
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
all
that
be
or
could
be
do
in
these
case
,
the
shutting
up
of
house
,
so
as
to
confine
those
that
be
well
with
those
that
be
sick
,
have
very
great
inconvenience
in
it
,
and
some
that
be
very
tragical
,
and
which
merit
to
have
be
consider
if
there
have
be
room
for
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
authorise
by
a
law
,
it
have
the
public
good
in
view
as
the
end
chiefly
aim
at
,
and
all
the
private
injury
that
be
do
by
the
put
it
in
execution
must
be
put
to
the
account
of
the
public
benefit
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
doubtful
to
this
day
whether
,
in
the
whole
,
it
contribute
anything
to
the
stop
of
the
infection
;
and
indeed
I
can
not
say
it
do
,
for
nothing
could
run
with
great
fury
and
rage
than
the
infection
do
when
it
be
in
its
chief
violence
,
though
the
house
infect
be
shut
up
as
exactly
and
as
effectually
as
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
if
all
the
infected
person
be
effectually
shut
in
,
no
sound
person
could
have
be
infect
by
them
,
because
they
could
not
have
come
near
them
.
<EOS>
but
the
case
be
this
(
and
I
shall
only
touch
it
here
)
:
namely
,
that
the
infection
be
propagate
insensibly
,
and
by
such
person
as
be
not
visibly
infect
,
who
neither
know
whom
they
infect
or
who
they
be
infect
by
.
  
<EOS>
a
house
in
Whitechappel
be
shut
up
for
the
sake
of
one
infect
maid
,
who
have
only
spot
,
not
the
token
come
out
upon
her
,
and
recover
;
yet
these
people
obtain
no
liberty
to
stir
,
neither
for
air
or
exercise
,
forty
day
.
<EOS>
want
of
breath
,
fear
,
anger
,
vexation
,
and
all
the
other
gift
attend
such
an
injurious
treatment
cast
the
mistress
of
the
family
into
a
fever
,
and
visitor
come
into
the
house
and
say
it
be
the
plague
,
though
the
physician
declare
it
be
not
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
family
be
oblige
to
begin
their
quarantine
anew
on
the
report
of
the
visitor
or
examiner
,
though
their
former
quarantine
want
but
a
few
day
of
be
finish
.
<EOS>
this
oppress
them
so
with
anger
and
grief
,
and
,
as
before
,
straiten
them
also
so
much
as
to
room
,
and
for
want
of
breathing
and
free
air
,
that
most
of
the
family
fall
sick
,
one
of
one
distemper
,
one
of
another
,
chiefly
scorbutic
ailment
;
only
one
,
a
violent
colic
;
till
,
after
several
prolonging
of
their
confinement
,
some
or
other
of
those
that
come
in
with
the
visitor
to
inspect
the
person
that
be
ill
,
in
hope
of
release
them
,
bring
the
distemper
with
them
and
infect
the
whole
house
;
and
all
or
most
of
them
die
,
not
of
the
plague
as
really
upon
them
before
,
but
of
the
plague
that
those
people
bring
them
,
who
should
have
be
careful
to
have
protect
them
from
it
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
a
thing
which
frequently
happen
,
and
be
indeed
one
of
the
bad
consequence
of
shut
house
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
about
this
time
a
little
hardship
put
upon
me
,
which
I
be
at
first
greatly
afflict
at
,
and
very
much
disturb
about
though
,
as
it
prove
,
it
do
not
expose
me
to
any
disaster
;
and
this
be
be
appoint
by
the
alderman
of
Portsoken
Ward
one
of
the
examiner
of
the
house
in
the
precinct
where
I
live
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
large
parish
,
and
have
no
less
than
eighteen
examiner
,
as
the
order
call
us
;
the
people
call
us
visitor
.
<EOS>
I
endeavour
with
all
my
might
to
be
excuse
from
such
an
employment
,
and
use
many
argument
with
the
alderman
's
deputy
to
be
excuse
;
particularly
I
allege
that
I
be
against
shut
up
house
at
all
,
and
that
it
would
be
very
hard
to
oblige
me
to
be
an
instrument
in
that
which
be
against
my
judgement
,
and
which
I
do
verily
believe
would
not
answer
the
end
it
be
intend
for
;
but
all
the
abatement
I
could
get
be
only
,
that
whereas
the
officer
be
appoint
by
my
Lord
Mayor
to
continue
two
month
,
I
should
be
oblige
to
hold
it
but
three
week
,
on
condition
nevertheless
that
I
could
then
get
some
other
sufficient
housekeeper
to
serve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
me
 
which
be
,
in
short
,
but
a
very
small
favour
,
it
be
very
difficult
to
get
any
man
to
accept
of
such
an
employment
,
that
be
fit
to
be
entrust
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
shut
up
of
house
have
one
effect
,
which
I
be
sensible
be
of
moment
,
<EOS>
namely
,
it
confine
the
distemper
people
,
who
would
otherwise
have
be
both
very
troublesome
and
very
dangerous
in
their
run
about
street
with
the
distemper
upon
them
 
<EOS>
which
,
when
they
be
delirious
,
they
would
have
do
in
a
most
frightful
manner
,
and
as
indeed
they
begin
to
do
at
first
very
much
,
till
they
be
thus
restrained
;
nay
,
so
very
open
they
be
that
the
poor
would
go
about
and
beg
at
people
's
door
,
and
say
they
have
the
plague
upon
them
,
and
beg
rag
for
their
sore
,
or
both
,
or
anything
that
delirious
nature
happen
to
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
a
poor
,
unhappy
gentlewoman
,
a
substantial
citizen
's
wife
,
be
(
if
the
story
be
true
)
murder
by
one
of
these
creature
in
Aldersgate
Street
,
or
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
along
the
street
,
rave
mad
to
be
sure
,
and
singe
;
the
people
only
say
he
be
drunk
,
but
he
himself
say
he
have
the
plague
upon
him
,
which
it
seem
be
true
;
and
meet
this
gentlewoman
,
he
would
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
terribly
fright
,
as
he
be
only
a
rude
fellow
,
and
she
run
from
him
,
but
the
street
be
very
thin
of
people
,
there
be
nobody
near
enough
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
when
she
see
he
would
overtake
her
,
she
turn
and
give
him
a
thrust
so
forcibly
,
he
be
but
weak
,
and
push
him
down
backward
.
<EOS>
but
very
unhappily
,
she
be
so
near
,
he
catch
hold
of
her
and
pull
her
down
also
,
and
get
up
first
,
master
her
and
kiss
her
;
and
which
be
bad
of
all
,
when
he
have
do
,
tell
her
he
have
the
plague
,
and
why
should
not
she
have
it
as
well
as
he
?
<EOS>
She
be
fright
enough
before
,
be
also
young
with
child
;
but
when
she
hear
him
say
he
have
the
plague
,
she
scream
out
and
fall
down
into
a
swoon
,
or
in
a
fit
,
which
,
though
she
recover
a
little
,
yet
kill
her
in
a
very
few
day
;
and
I
never
hear
whether
she
have
the
plague
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
another
infected
person
come
and
knock
at
the
door
of
a
citizen
's
house
where
they
know
him
very
well
;
the
servant
let
him
in
,
and
be
tell
the
master
of
the
house
be
above
,
he
run
up
and
come
into
the
room
to
them
as
the
whole
family
be
at
supper
.
<EOS>
They
begin
to
rise
up
,
a
little
surprised
,
not
know
what
the
matter
be
;
but
he
bid
them
sit
still
,
he
only
come
to
take
his
leave
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
ask
him
,
"
why
,
Mr
 
,
where
be
you
go
?
"
<EOS>
"
go
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
have
get
the
sickness
,
and
shall
die
tomorrow
night
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
easy
to
believe
,
though
not
to
describe
,
the
consternation
they
be
all
in
.
<EOS>
the
woman
and
the
man
's
daughter
,
which
be
but
little
girl
,
be
fright
almost
to
death
and
get
up
,
one
run
out
at
one
door
and
one
at
another
,
some
downstair
and
some
upstairs
,
and
get
together
as
well
as
they
could
,
lock
themselves
into
their
chamber
and
scream
out
at
the
window
for
help
,
as
if
they
have
be
fright
out
of
their
wit
.
<EOS>
the
master
,
more
composed
than
they
,
though
both
fright
and
provoke
,
be
go
to
lay
hand
on
him
and
throw
him
downstairs
,
be
in
a
passion
;
but
then
,
consider
a
little
the
condition
of
the
man
and
the
danger
of
touch
him
,
horror
seize
his
mind
,
and
he
stand
still
like
one
astonish
.
<EOS>
the
poor
distemper
man
all
this
while
,
be
as
well
disease
in
his
brain
as
in
his
body
,
stand
still
like
one
amazed
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
turn
round
:
"
ay
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
with
all
the
seem
calmness
imaginable
,
"
be
it
so
with
you
all
?
<EOS>
be
you
all
disturb
at
me
?
<EOS>
why
,
then
I
will
e'en
go
home
and
die
there
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
immediately
downstairs
.
<EOS>
the
servant
that
have
let
him
in
go
down
after
him
with
a
candle
,
but
be
afraid
to
go
past
him
and
open
the
door
,
so
he
stand
on
the
stair
to
see
what
he
would
do
.
<EOS>
the
man
go
and
open
the
door
,
and
go
out
and
fling
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
while
before
the
family
recover
the
fright
,
but
as
no
ill
consequence
attend
,
they
have
have
occasion
since
to
speak
of
it
<EOS>
(
You
may
be
sure
)
with
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
though
the
man
be
go
,
it
be
some
time
 
<EOS>
nay
,
as
I
hear
,
some
day
before
they
recover
themselves
of
the
hurry
they
be
in
;
nor
do
they
go
up
and
down
the
house
with
any
assurance
till
they
have
burn
a
great
variety
of
fume
and
perfume
in
all
the
room
,
and
make
a
great
many
smoke
of
pitch
,
of
gunpowder
,
and
of
sulphur
,
all
separately
shift
,
and
wash
their
clothe
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
poor
man
,
whether
he
live
or
die
I
do
not
remember
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
most
certain
that
,
if
by
the
shutting
up
of
house
the
sick
bad
not
be
confine
,
multitude
who
in
the
height
of
their
fever
be
delirious
and
distract
would
have
be
continually
run
up
and
down
the
street
;
and
even
as
it
be
a
very
great
number
do
so
,
and
offer
all
sort
of
violence
to
those
they
meet
,
even
just
as
a
mad
dog
run
on
and
bite
at
every
one
he
meet
;
nor
can
I
doubt
but
that
,
should
one
of
those
infect
,
diseased
creature
have
bite
any
man
or
woman
while
the
frenzy
of
the
distemper
be
upon
them
,
they
,
<EOS>
I
mean
the
person
so
wounded
,
would
as
certainly
have
be
incurably
infect
as
one
that
be
sick
before
,
and
have
the
token
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
of
one
infected
creature
who
,
run
out
of
his
bed
in
his
shirt
in
the
anguish
and
agony
of
his
swelling
,
of
which
he
have
three
upon
him
,
get
his
shoe
on
and
go
to
put
on
his
coat
;
but
the
nurse
resist
,
and
snatch
the
coat
from
him
,
he
throw
her
down
,
run
over
her
,
run
downstairs
and
into
the
street
,
directly
to
the
Thames
in
his
shirt
;
the
nurse
run
after
him
,
and
call
to
the
watch
to
stop
him
;
but
the
watchman
,
fright
at
the
man
,
and
afraid
to
touch
him
,
let
him
go
on
;
upon
which
he
run
down
to
the
Stillyard
stair
,
throw
away
his
shirt
,
and
plunge
into
the
Thames
,
and
,
be
a
good
swimmer
,
swam
quite
over
the
river
;
and
the
tide
be
come
in
,
as
they
call
it
(
that
is
,
run
westward
)
<EOS>
he
reach
the
land
not
till
he
come
about
the
Falcon
stair
,
where
landing
,
and
find
no
people
there
,
it
be
in
the
night
,
he
run
about
the
street
there
,
naked
as
he
be
,
for
a
good
while
<EOS>
,
when
,
it
be
by
that
time
high
water
,
he
take
the
river
again
,
and
swam
back
to
the
Stillyard
,
land
,
run
up
the
street
again
to
his
own
house
,
knock
at
the
door
,
go
up
the
stair
and
into
his
bed
again
;
and
that
this
terrible
experiment
cure
him
of
the
plague
,
that
be
to
say
,
that
the
violent
motion
of
his
arm
and
leg
stretch
the
part
where
the
swelling
he
have
upon
him
be
,
that
be
to
say
,
under
his
arm
and
his
groin
,
and
cause
them
to
ripen
and
break
;
and
that
the
cold
of
the
water
abate
the
fever
in
his
blood
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
add
that
I
do
not
relate
this
any
more
than
some
of
the
other
,
as
a
fact
within
my
own
knowledge
,
so
as
that
I
can
vouch
the
truth
of
them
,
and
especially
that
of
the
man
be
cure
by
the
extravagant
adventure
,
which
I
confess
I
do
not
think
very
possible
;
but
it
may
serve
to
confirm
the
many
desperate
thing
which
the
distressed
people
fall
into
delirium
,
and
what
we
call
light
-
headedness
,
be
frequently
run
upon
at
that
time
,
and
<EOS>
how
infinitely
more
such
there
would
have
be
if
such
people
have
not
be
confine
by
the
shutting
up
of
house
;
and
this
I
take
to
be
the
good
,
if
not
the
only
good
thing
which
be
perform
by
that
severe
method
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
complaint
and
the
murmuring
be
very
bitter
against
the
thing
itself
.
<EOS>
It
would
pierce
the
heart
of
all
that
come
by
to
hear
the
piteous
cry
of
those
infect
people
,
who
,
be
thus
out
of
their
understanding
by
the
violence
of
their
pain
or
the
heat
of
their
blood
,
be
either
shut
in
or
perhaps
tie
in
their
bed
and
chair
,
to
prevent
their
do
themselves
hurt
 
and
who
would
make
a
dreadful
outcry
at
their
be
confine
,
and
at
their
be
not
permit
to
die
at
large
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
as
they
would
have
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
this
running
of
distemper
people
about
the
street
be
very
dismal
,
and
the
magistrate
do
their
utmost
to
prevent
it
;
but
as
it
be
generally
in
the
night
and
always
sudden
when
such
attempt
be
make
,
the
officer
could
not
be
at
band
to
prevent
it
;
and
even
when
any
get
out
in
the
day
,
the
officer
appoint
do
not
care
to
meddle
with
them
,
because
,
as
they
be
all
grievously
infect
,
to
be
sure
,
when
they
be
come
to
that
height
,
so
they
be
more
than
ordinarily
infectious
,
and
it
be
one
of
the
most
dangerous
thing
that
could
be
to
touch
them
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
they
generally
run
on
,
not
know
what
they
do
,
till
they
drop
down
stark
dead
,
or
till
they
have
exhaust
their
spirit
so
as
that
they
would
fall
and
then
die
in
perhaps
half
-
an
-
hour
or
an
hour
;
and
,
which
be
most
piteous
to
hear
,
they
be
sure
to
come
to
themselves
entirely
in
that
half
-
hour
or
hour
,
and
then
to
make
most
grievous
and
piercing
cry
and
lamentation
in
the
deep
,
afflict
sense
of
the
condition
they
be
in
.
<EOS>
this
be
much
of
it
before
the
order
for
shut
up
of
house
be
strictly
put
in
execution
,
for
at
first
the
watchman
be
not
so
vigorous
and
severe
as
they
be
afterward
in
the
keeping
the
people
in
;
that
be
to
say
,
before
they
be
(
I
mean
<EOS>
some
of
them
)
severely
punish
for
their
neglect
,
fail
in
their
duty
,
and
let
people
who
be
under
their
care
slip
away
,
or
connive
at
their
go
abroad
,
whether
sick
or
well
.
<EOS>
but
after
they
see
the
officer
appoint
to
examine
into
their
conduct
be
resolve
to
have
them
do
their
duty
or
be
punish
for
the
omission
,
they
be
more
exact
,
and
the
people
be
strictly
restrain
;
which
be
a
thing
they
take
so
ill
and
bear
so
impatiently
that
their
discontent
can
hardly
be
describe
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
an
absolute
necessity
for
it
,
that
must
be
confess
,
unless
some
other
measure
have
be
timely
enter
upon
,
and
it
be
too
late
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
have
not
this
particular
(
of
the
sick
being
restrain
as
above
)
be
our
case
at
that
time
,
London
would
have
be
the
most
dreadful
place
that
ever
be
in
the
world
;
there
would
,
for
aught
I
know
,
have
as
many
people
die
in
the
street
as
die
in
their
house
;
for
when
the
distemper
be
at
its
height
it
generally
make
them
rave
and
delirious
,
and
when
they
be
so
they
would
never
be
persuade
to
keep
in
their
bed
but
by
force
;
and
many
who
be
not
tie
throw
themselves
out
of
window
when
they
find
they
could
not
get
leave
to
go
out
of
their
door
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
for
want
of
people
converse
one
with
another
,
in
this
time
of
calamity
,
that
it
be
impossible
any
particular
person
could
come
at
the
knowledge
of
all
the
extraordinary
case
that
occur
in
different
family
;
and
particularly
I
believe
it
be
never
know
to
this
day
how
many
people
in
their
delirium
drown
themselves
in
the
Thames
,
and
in
the
river
which
run
from
the
marsh
by
Hackney
,
which
we
generally
call
Ware
River
,
or
Hackney
River
.
<EOS>
as
to
those
which
be
set
down
in
the
weekly
bill
,
they
be
indeed
few
;
nor
could
it
be
know
of
any
of
those
whether
they
drown
themselves
by
accident
or
not
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
I
may
reckon
up
more
who
within
the
compass
of
my
knowledge
or
observation
really
drown
themselves
in
that
year
,
than
be
put
down
in
the
bill
of
all
put
together
:
for
many
of
the
body
be
never
find
who
yet
be
know
to
be
lose
;
and
the
like
in
other
method
of
self
-
destruction
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
one
man
in
or
about
Whitecross
Street
burn
himself
to
death
in
his
bed
;
some
say
it
be
do
by
himself
,
other
that
it
be
by
the
treachery
of
the
nurse
that
attend
him
;
but
that
he
have
the
plague
upon
him
be
agree
by
all
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
merciful
disposition
of
Providence
also
,
and
which
I
have
many
time
think
of
at
that
time
,
that
no
fire
,
or
no
considerable
one
at
least
,
happen
in
the
city
during
that
year
,
<EOS>
which
,
if
it
have
be
otherwise
,
would
have
be
very
dreadful
;
and
either
the
people
must
have
let
them
alone
unquenched
,
or
have
come
together
in
great
crowd
and
throng
,
unconcerned
at
the
danger
of
the
infection
,
not
concern
at
the
house
they
go
into
,
at
the
good
they
handle
,
or
at
the
person
or
the
people
they
come
among
.
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
,
that
except
that
in
Cripplegate
parish
,
and
two
or
three
little
eruption
of
fire
,
which
be
presently
extinguish
,
there
be
no
disaster
of
that
kind
happen
in
the
whole
year
.
<EOS>
They
tell
us
a
story
of
a
house
in
a
place
call
Swan
Alley
,
pass
from
Goswell
Street
,
near
the
end
of
Old
Street
,
into
St
John
Street
,
that
a
family
be
infect
there
in
so
terrible
a
manner
that
every
one
of
the
house
die
.
<EOS>
the
last
person
lie
dead
on
the
floor
,
and
,
as
it
be
suppose
,
have
lie
herself
all
along
to
die
just
before
the
fire
;
the
fire
,
it
seem
,
have
fall
from
its
place
,
be
of
wood
,
and
have
take
hold
of
the
board
and
the
joist
they
lie
on
,
and
burn
as
far
as
just
to
the
body
,
but
have
not
take
hold
of
the
dead
body
(
though
she
have
little
more
than
her
shift
on
)
and
have
go
out
of
itself
,
not
burn
the
rest
of
the
house
,
though
it
be
a
slight
timber
house
.
<EOS>
how
true
this
may
be
I
do
not
determine
,
but
the
city
be
to
suffer
severely
the
next
year
by
fire
,
this
year
it
feel
very
little
of
that
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
consider
the
delirium
which
the
agony
throw
people
into
,
and
how
I
have
mention
in
their
madness
,
when
they
be
alone
,
they
do
many
desperate
thing
,
it
be
very
strange
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
disaster
of
that
kind
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
frequently
ask
me
,
and
I
can
not
say
that
I
ever
know
how
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
it
<EOS>
,
how
it
come
to
pass
that
so
many
infected
people
appear
abroad
in
the
street
at
the
same
time
that
the
house
which
be
infect
be
so
vigilantly
search
,
and
all
of
them
shut
up
and
guard
as
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
answer
to
give
to
this
,
unless
it
be
this
:
<EOS>
that
in
so
great
and
populous
a
city
as
this
be
it
be
impossible
to
discover
every
house
that
be
infect
as
soon
as
it
be
so
,
or
to
shut
up
all
the
house
that
be
infect
;
so
that
people
have
the
liberty
of
go
about
the
street
,
even
where
they
please
,
unless
they
be
know
to
belong
to
such
-
and
-
such
infected
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
,
as
several
physician
tell
my
Lord
Mayor
,
the
fury
of
the
contagion
be
such
at
some
particular
time
,
and
people
sicken
so
fast
and
die
so
soon
,
that
it
be
impossible
,
and
indeed
to
no
purpose
,
to
go
about
to
inquire
who
be
sick
and
who
be
well
,
or
to
shut
them
up
with
such
exactness
as
the
thing
require
,
almost
every
house
in
a
whole
street
be
infect
,
and
in
many
place
every
person
in
some
of
the
house
;
and
that
which
be
still
bad
,
by
the
time
that
the
house
be
know
to
be
infect
,
most
of
the
person
infect
would
be
stone
dead
,
and
the
rest
run
away
for
fear
of
be
shut
up
;
so
that
it
be
to
very
small
purpose
to
call
them
infected
house
and
shut
them
up
,
the
infection
have
ravage
and
take
its
leave
of
the
house
before
it
be
really
know
that
the
family
be
any
way
touch
.
  
<EOS>
this
may
be
sufficient
to
convince
any
reasonable
person
that
as
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
the
magistrate
or
of
any
human
method
of
policy
,
to
prevent
the
spread
the
infection
,
so
that
this
way
of
shut
up
of
house
be
perfectly
insufficient
for
that
end
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
seem
to
have
no
manner
of
public
good
in
it
,
equal
or
proportionable
to
the
grievous
burden
that
it
be
to
the
particular
family
that
be
so
shut
up
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
be
employ
by
the
public
in
direct
that
severity
,
I
frequently
find
occasion
to
see
that
it
be
incapable
of
answer
the
end
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
as
I
be
desire
,
as
a
visitor
or
examiner
,
to
inquire
into
the
particular
of
several
family
which
be
infect
,
we
scarce
come
to
any
house
where
the
plague
have
visibly
appear
in
the
family
but
that
some
of
the
family
be
flee
and
go
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
would
resent
this
,
and
charge
the
examiner
with
be
remiss
in
their
examination
or
inspection
.
<EOS>
but
by
that
mean
house
be
long
infect
before
it
be
know
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
I
be
in
this
dangerous
office
but
half
the
appoint
time
,
which
be
two
month
,
it
be
long
enough
to
inform
myself
that
we
be
no
way
capable
of
come
at
the
knowledge
of
the
true
state
of
any
family
but
by
inquire
at
the
door
or
of
the
neighbour
.
<EOS>
as
for
go
into
every
house
to
search
,
that
be
a
part
no
authority
would
offer
to
impose
on
the
inhabitant
,
or
any
citizen
would
undertake
:
for
it
would
have
be
expose
us
to
certain
infection
and
death
,
and
to
the
ruin
of
our
own
family
as
well
as
of
ourselves
;
nor
would
any
citizen
of
probity
,
and
that
could
be
depend
upon
,
have
stay
in
the
town
if
they
have
be
make
liable
to
such
a
severity
.
  
<EOS>
see
then
that
we
could
come
at
the
certainty
of
thing
by
no
method
<EOS>
but
that
of
inquiry
of
the
neighbour
or
of
the
family
,
and
on
that
we
could
not
justly
depend
,
it
be
not
possible
but
that
the
uncertainty
of
this
matter
would
remain
as
above
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
master
of
family
be
bind
by
the
order
to
give
notice
to
the
examiner
of
the
place
wherein
he
live
,
within
two
hour
after
he
should
discover
it
,
of
any
person
be
sick
in
his
house
(
that
be
to
say
,
have
sign
of
the
infection
)
 
<EOS>
but
they
find
so
many
way
to
evade
this
and
excuse
their
negligence
that
they
seldom
give
that
notice
till
they
have
take
measure
to
have
every
one
escape
out
of
the
house
who
have
a
mind
to
escape
,
whether
they
be
sick
or
sound
;
and
while
this
be
so
,
it
be
easy
to
see
that
the
shutting
up
of
house
be
no
way
to
be
depend
upon
as
a
sufficient
method
for
put
a
stop
to
the
infection
because
,
as
I
have
say
elsewhere
,
many
of
those
that
so
go
out
of
those
infected
house
have
the
plague
really
upon
them
,
though
they
may
really
think
themselves
sound
.
<EOS>
and
some
of
these
be
the
people
that
walk
the
street
till
they
fall
down
dead
,
not
that
they
be
suddenly
strike
with
the
distemper
as
with
a
bullet
that
kill
with
the
stroke
,
but
that
they
really
have
the
infection
in
their
blood
long
before
;
only
,
that
as
it
prey
secretly
on
the
vital
,
it
appear
not
till
it
seize
the
heart
with
a
mortal
power
,
and
the
patient
die
in
a
moment
,
as
with
a
sudden
fainting
or
an
apoplectic
fit
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
that
some
even
of
our
physician
think
for
a
time
that
those
people
that
so
die
in
the
street
be
seize
but
that
moment
they
fall
,
as
if
they
have
be
touch
by
a
stroke
from
heaven
as
man
be
kill
by
a
flash
of
lightning
 
<EOS>
but
they
find
reason
to
alter
their
opinion
afterward
;
for
upon
examine
the
body
of
such
after
they
be
dead
,
they
always
either
have
token
upon
them
or
other
evident
proof
of
the
distemper
have
be
long
upon
them
than
they
have
otherwise
expect
.
  
<EOS>
this
often
be
the
reason
that
,
as
I
have
say
,
we
that
be
examiner
be
not
able
to
come
at
the
knowledge
of
the
infection
be
enter
into
a
house
till
it
be
too
late
to
shut
it
up
,
and
sometimes
not
till
the
people
that
be
leave
be
all
dead
.
<EOS>
in
Petticoat
Lane
two
house
together
be
infect
,
and
several
people
sick
;
but
the
distemper
be
so
well
conceal
,
the
examiner
,
who
be
my
neighbour
,
get
no
knowledge
of
it
till
notice
be
send
him
that
the
people
be
all
dead
,
and
that
the
cart
should
call
there
to
fetch
them
away
.
<EOS>
the
two
head
of
the
family
concert
their
measure
,
and
so
order
their
matter
as
that
when
the
examiner
be
in
the
neighbourhood
they
appear
generally
at
a
time
,
and
answer
,
that
is
,
lie
,
for
one
another
,
or
get
some
of
the
neighbourhood
to
say
they
be
all
in
health
 
and
perhaps
know
no
better
 
till
,
death
make
it
impossible
to
keep
it
any
longer
as
a
secret
,
the
dead
-
cart
be
call
in
the
night
to
both
the
house
t
<EOS>
and
so
it
become
public
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
examiner
order
the
constable
to
shut
up
the
house
there
be
<EOS>
nobody
leave
in
them
but
three
people
,
two
in
one
house
and
one
in
the
other
,
just
die
,
and
a
nurse
in
each
house
who
acknowledge
that
they
have
bury
five
before
,
that
the
house
have
be
infect
nine
or
ten
day
,
and
that
for
all
the
rest
of
the
two
family
,
which
be
many
,
they
be
go
,
some
sick
,
some
well
,
or
whether
sick
or
well
could
not
be
know
.
  
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
at
another
house
in
the
same
lane
,
a
man
have
his
family
infect
but
very
unwilling
to
be
shut
up
,
when
he
could
conceal
it
no
longer
,
shut
up
himself
;
that
be
to
say
,
he
set
the
great
red
cross
upon
his
door
with
the
word
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
"
,
and
so
delude
the
examiner
,
who
suppose
it
have
be
do
by
the
constable
by
order
of
the
other
examiner
,
for
there
be
two
examiner
to
every
district
or
precinct
.
<EOS>
by
this
mean
he
have
free
egress
and
regress
into
his
house
again
and
out
of
it
,
as
he
please
,
notwithstanding
it
be
infect
,
till
at
length
his
stratagem
be
find
out
;
and
then
he
,
with
the
sound
part
of
his
servant
and
family
,
make
off
and
escape
,
so
they
be
not
shut
up
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
make
it
very
hard
,
if
not
impossible
,
as
I
have
say
,
to
prevent
the
spreading
of
an
infection
by
the
shutting
up
of
house
 
unless
the
people
would
think
the
shutting
of
their
house
no
grievance
,
and
be
so
willing
to
have
it
do
as
that
they
would
give
notice
duly
and
faithfully
to
the
magistrate
of
their
be
infect
as
soon
as
it
be
know
by
themselves
;
but
as
that
can
not
be
expect
from
them
,
and
the
examiner
can
not
be
suppose
,
as
above
,
to
go
into
their
house
to
visit
and
search
,
all
the
good
of
shut
up
house
will
be
defeat
,
and
few
house
will
be
shut
up
in
time
,
except
those
of
the
poor
,
who
can
not
conceal
it
,
and
of
some
people
who
will
be
discover
by
the
terror
and
consternation
which
the
thing
put
them
into
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
myself
discharge
of
the
dangerous
office
I
be
in
as
soon
as
I
could
get
another
admit
,
whom
I
have
obtain
for
a
little
money
to
accept
of
it
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
instead
of
serve
the
two
month
,
which
be
direct
,
I
be
not
above
three
week
in
it
;
and
a
great
while
too
,
consider
it
be
in
the
month
of
August
,
at
which
time
the
distemper
begin
to
rage
with
great
violence
at
our
end
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
execution
of
this
office
I
could
not
refrain
speak
my
opinion
among
my
neighbour
as
to
this
shutting
up
the
people
in
their
house
;
in
which
we
see
most
evidently
the
severity
that
be
use
,
though
grievous
in
themselves
,
have
also
this
particular
objection
against
them
:
namely
,
that
they
do
not
answer
the
end
,
as
I
have
say
,
but
that
the
distemper
people
go
day
by
day
about
the
street
;
and
it
be
our
united
opinion
that
a
method
to
have
remove
the
sound
from
the
sick
,
in
case
of
a
particular
house
be
visit
,
would
have
be
much
more
reasonable
on
many
account
,
leave
nobody
with
the
sick
person
but
such
as
should
on
such
occasion
request
to
stay
and
declare
themselves
content
to
be
shut
up
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Our
scheme
for
remove
those
that
be
sound
from
those
that
be
sick
be
only
in
such
house
as
be
infect
,
and
confine
the
sick
be
no
confinement
;
those
that
could
not
stir
would
not
complain
while
they
be
in
their
sense
and
while
they
have
the
power
of
judging
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
they
come
to
be
delirious
and
light
-
head
,
then
they
would
cry
out
of
the
cruelty
of
be
confine
;
but
for
the
removal
of
those
that
be
well
,
we
think
it
highly
reasonable
and
just
,
for
their
own
sake
,
they
should
be
remove
from
the
sick
,
and
that
for
other
people
's
safety
they
should
keep
retire
for
a
while
,
to
see
that
they
be
sound
,
and
may
not
infect
other
;
and
we
think
twenty
or
thirty
day
enough
for
this
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
certainly
,
if
house
have
be
provide
on
purpose
for
those
that
be
sound
to
perform
this
demi
-
quarantine
in
,
they
would
have
much
less
reason
to
think
themselves
injure
in
such
a
restraint
than
in
be
confine
with
infected
people
in
the
house
where
they
live
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
here
,
however
,
to
be
observe
that
after
the
funeral
become
so
many
that
people
could
not
toll
the
bell
,
mourn
or
weep
,
or
wear
black
for
one
another
,
as
they
do
before
;
no
,
nor
so
much
as
make
coffin
for
those
that
die
;
so
after
a
while
the
fury
of
the
infection
appear
to
be
so
increase
that
,
in
short
,
they
shut
up
no
house
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
seem
enough
that
all
the
remedy
of
that
kind
have
be
use
till
they
be
find
fruitless
,
and
that
the
plague
spread
itself
with
an
irresistible
fury
;
so
that
as
the
fire
the
succeed
year
spread
itself
,
and
burn
with
such
violence
that
the
citizen
,
in
despair
,
give
over
their
endeavour
to
extinguish
it
,
so
in
the
plague
it
come
at
last
to
such
violence
that
the
people
sit
still
look
at
one
another
,
and
seem
quite
abandon
to
despair
;
whole
street
seem
to
be
desolate
,
and
not
to
be
shut
up
only
,
but
to
be
empty
of
their
inhabitant
;
door
be
leave
open
,
window
stand
shatter
with
the
wind
in
empty
house
for
want
of
people
to
shut
them
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
people
begin
to
give
up
themselves
to
their
fear
and
to
think
that
all
regulation
and
method
be
in
vain
,
and
that
there
be
nothing
to
be
hope
for
but
an
universal
desolation
;
and
it
be
even
in
the
height
of
this
general
despair
that
it
please
God
to
stay
His
hand
,
and
to
slacken
the
fury
of
the
contagion
in
such
a
manner
as
be
even
surprising
,
like
its
beginning
,
and
demonstrate
it
to
be
His
own
particular
hand
,
and
that
above
,
if
not
without
the
agency
of
mean
,
as
I
shall
take
notice
of
in
its
proper
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
must
still
speak
of
the
plague
as
in
its
height
,
rage
even
to
desolation
,
and
the
people
under
the
most
dreadful
consternation
,
even
,
as
I
have
say
,
to
despair
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
credible
to
what
excess
the
passion
of
man
carry
them
in
this
extremity
of
the
distemper
,
and
this
part
,
I
think
,
be
as
move
as
the
rest
.
<EOS>
what
could
affect
a
man
in
his
full
power
of
reflection
,
and
what
could
make
deep
impression
on
the
soul
,
than
to
see
a
man
almost
naked
,
and
get
out
of
his
house
,
or
perhaps
out
of
his
bed
,
into
the
street
,
come
out
of
Harrow
Alley
,
a
populous
conjunction
or
collection
of
alley
,
court
,
and
passage
in
the
Butcher
Row
in
Whitechappel
,
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
what
could
be
more
affecting
than
to
see
this
poor
man
come
out
into
the
open
street
,
run
dance
and
singe
and
make
a
thousand
antic
gesture
,
with
five
or
six
woman
and
child
run
after
him
,
cry
and
call
upon
him
for
the
Lord
's
sake
to
come
back
,
and
entreat
the
help
of
other
to
bring
him
back
,
but
all
in
vain
,
nobody
daring
to
lay
a
hand
upon
him
or
to
come
near
him
?
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
most
grievous
and
afflict
thing
to
me
,
who
see
it
all
from
my
own
window
;
for
all
this
while
the
poor
afflict
man
be
,
as
I
observe
it
,
even
then
in
the
utmost
agony
of
pain
,
have
(
as
they
say
)
<EOS>
two
swelling
upon
him
which
could
not
be
bring
to
break
or
to
suppurate
;
but
,
by
lay
strong
caustic
on
them
,
the
surgeon
have
,
it
seem
,
hope
to
break
them
 
which
caustic
be
then
upon
him
,
burn
his
flesh
as
with
a
hot
iron
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
what
become
of
this
poor
man
,
but
I
think
he
continue
rove
about
in
that
manner
till
he
fall
down
and
die
.
  
<EOS>
no
wonder
the
aspect
of
the
city
itself
be
frightful
.
<EOS>
the
usual
concourse
of
people
in
the
street
,
and
which
use
to
be
supply
from
our
end
of
the
town
,
be
abate
.
<EOS>
the
Exchange
be
not
keep
shut
,
indeed
,
but
it
be
no
more
frequented
.
<EOS>
the
fire
be
lose
;
they
have
be
almost
extinguish
for
some
day
by
a
very
smart
and
hasty
rain
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
all
;
some
of
the
physician
insist
that
they
be
not
only
no
benefit
,
but
injurious
to
the
health
of
people
.
<EOS>
this
they
make
a
loud
clamour
about
,
and
complain
to
the
Lord
Mayor
about
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
other
of
the
same
faculty
,
and
eminent
too
,
oppose
them
,
and
give
their
reason
why
the
fire
be
,
and
must
be
,
useful
to
assuage
the
violence
of
the
distemper
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
a
full
account
of
their
argument
on
both
side
;
only
this
I
remember
,
that
they
cavil
very
much
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
some
be
for
fire
,
but
that
they
must
be
make
of
wood
and
not
coal
,
and
of
particular
sort
of
wood
too
,
such
as
fir
in
particular
,
or
cedar
,
because
of
the
strong
effluvia
of
turpentine
;
other
be
for
coal
and
not
wood
,
because
of
the
sulphur
and
bituman
;
and
other
be
for
neither
one
or
other
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
the
Lord
Mayor
order
no
more
fire
,
and
especially
on
this
account
,
namely
,
that
the
plague
be
so
fierce
that
they
see
evidently
it
defy
all
mean
,
and
rather
seem
to
increase
than
decrease
upon
any
application
to
check
and
abate
it
;
and
yet
this
amazement
of
the
magistrate
proceed
rather
from
want
of
be
able
to
apply
any
mean
successfully
than
from
any
unwillingness
either
to
expose
themselves
or
undertake
the
care
and
weight
of
business
;
for
,
to
do
them
justice
,
they
neither
spare
their
pain
nor
their
person
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
answer
;
the
infection
rage
,
and
the
people
be
now
fright
and
terrified
to
the
last
degree
:
so
that
,
as
I
may
say
,
they
give
themselves
up
,
and
,
as
I
mention
above
,
abandon
themselves
to
their
despair
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
me
observe
here
that
,
when
I
say
the
people
abandon
themselves
to
despair
,
I
do
not
mean
to
what
man
call
a
religious
despair
,
or
a
despair
of
their
eternal
state
,
but
I
mean
a
despair
of
their
be
able
to
escape
the
infection
or
to
outlive
the
plague
which
they
see
be
so
rage
and
so
irresistible
in
its
force
that
indeed
few
people
that
be
touch
with
it
in
its
height
,
about
August
and
September
,
escape
;
and
,
which
be
very
particular
,
contrary
to
its
ordinary
operation
in
June
and
July
,
and
the
beginning
of
August
,
when
,
as
I
have
observe
,
many
be
infect
,
and
continue
so
many
day
,
and
then
go
off
after
have
have
the
poison
in
their
blood
a
long
time
;
but
now
,
on
the
contrary
,
most
of
the
people
who
be
take
during
the
two
last
week
in
August
and
in
the
three
first
week
in
September
,
generally
die
in
two
or
three
day
at
furth
,
and
many
the
very
same
day
they
be
take
;
whether
the
dog
-
day
,
or
,
as
our
astrologer
pretend
to
express
themselves
,
the
influence
of
the
dog
-
star
,
have
that
malignant
effect
,
or
all
those
who
have
the
seed
of
infection
before
in
them
bring
it
up
to
a
maturity
at
that
time
altogether
,
I
know
not
;
but
this
be
the
time
when
it
be
report
that
above
3000
people
die
in
one
night
;
and
they
that
would
have
us
believe
they
more
critically
observe
it
pretend
to
say
that
they
all
die
within
the
space
of
two
hour
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
between
the
hour
of
one
and
three
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
suddenness
of
people
's
die
at
this
time
,
more
than
before
,
there
be
innumerable
instance
of
it
,
and
I
could
name
several
in
my
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
one
family
without
the
Bars
,
and
not
far
from
me
,
be
all
seemingly
well
on
the
Monday
,
be
ten
in
family
.
<EOS>
that
evening
one
maid
and
one
apprentice
be
take
ill
and
die
the
next
morning
 
when
the
other
apprentice
and
two
child
be
touch
,
whereof
one
die
the
same
evening
,
and
the
other
two
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
by
Saturday
at
noon
the
master
,
mistress
,
four
child
,
and
four
servant
be
all
go
,
and
the
house
leave
entirely
empty
,
except
an
ancient
woman
who
come
in
to
take
charge
of
the
good
for
the
master
of
the
family
's
brother
,
who
live
not
far
off
,
and
who
have
not
be
sick
.
  
<EOS>
many
house
be
then
leave
desolate
,
all
the
people
be
carry
away
dead
,
and
especially
in
an
alley
farther
on
the
same
side
beyond
the
Bars
,
go
in
at
the
sign
of
Moses
and
Aaron
<EOS>
,
there
be
several
house
together
which
,
they
say
,
have
not
one
person
leave
alive
in
them
;
and
some
that
die
last
in
several
of
those
house
be
leave
a
little
too
long
before
they
be
fetch
out
to
be
bury
;
the
reason
of
which
be
not
,
as
some
have
write
very
untruly
,
that
the
living
be
not
sufficient
to
bury
the
dead
,
but
that
the
mortality
be
so
great
in
the
yard
or
alley
that
there
be
nobody
leave
to
give
notice
to
the
burier
or
sexton
that
there
be
any
dead
body
there
to
be
bury
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
,
how
true
I
know
not
,
that
some
of
those
body
be
so
much
corrupt
and
so
rotten
that
it
be
with
difficulty
they
be
carry
;
and
as
the
cart
could
not
come
any
nearer
than
to
the
Alley
Gate
in
the
High
Street
,
it
be
so
much
the
more
difficult
to
bring
them
along
;
but
I
be
not
certain
how
many
body
be
then
leave
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
ordinarily
it
be
not
so
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
mention
how
the
people
be
bring
into
a
condition
to
despair
of
life
and
abandon
themselves
,
so
this
very
thing
have
a
strange
effect
among
us
for
three
or
four
week
;
that
is
,
it
make
them
bold
and
venturous
<EOS>
:
they
be
no
more
shy
of
one
another
,
or
restrain
within
door
,
but
go
anywhere
and
everywhere
,
and
begin
to
converse
.
<EOS>
one
would
say
to
another
,
"
I
do
not
ask
you
how
you
be
,
or
say
how
I
be
;
it
be
certain
we
shall
all
go
;
so
'
tis
no
matter
who
be
all
sick
or
who
be
sound
"
;
and
so
they
run
desperately
into
any
place
or
any
company
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
bring
the
people
into
public
company
,
so
it
be
surprising
how
it
bring
them
to
crowd
into
the
church
.
<EOS>
They
inquire
no
more
into
whom
they
sit
near
to
or
far
from
,
what
offensive
smell
they
meet
with
,
or
what
condition
the
people
seem
to
be
in
;
but
,
look
upon
themselves
all
as
so
many
dead
corpse
,
they
come
to
the
church
without
the
least
caution
,
and
crowd
together
as
if
their
life
be
of
no
consequence
compare
to
the
work
which
they
come
about
there
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
zeal
which
they
show
in
come
,
and
the
earnestness
and
affection
they
show
in
their
attention
to
what
they
hear
,
make
it
manifest
what
a
value
people
would
all
put
upon
the
worship
of
God
if
they
think
every
day
they
attend
at
the
church
that
it
would
be
their
last
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
it
without
other
strange
effect
,
for
it
take
away
,
all
manner
of
prejudice
at
or
scruple
about
the
person
whom
they
find
in
the
pulpit
when
they
come
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
doubt
but
that
many
of
the
minister
of
the
parish
church
be
cut
off
,
among
other
,
in
so
common
and
dreadful
a
calamity
;
and
other
have
not
courage
enough
to
stand
it
,
but
remove
into
the
country
as
they
find
mean
for
escape
.
<EOS>
as
then
some
parish
church
be
quite
vacant
and
forsaken
,
the
people
make
no
scruple
of
desire
such
dissenter
as
have
be
a
few
year
before
deprive
of
their
living
by
virtue
of
the
Act
of
Parliament
call
the
Act
of
Uniformity
to
preach
in
the
church
;
nor
do
the
church
minister
in
that
case
make
any
difficulty
of
accept
their
assistance
;
so
that
many
of
those
whom
they
call
silence
minister
have
their
mouth
open
on
this
occasion
and
preach
publicly
to
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
may
observe
and
I
hope
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
take
notice
of
it
that
a
near
view
of
death
would
soon
reconcile
man
of
good
principle
one
to
another
,
and
that
it
be
chiefly
owe
to
our
easy
situation
in
life
and
our
put
these
thing
far
from
us
that
our
breach
be
foment
,
ill
blood
continue
,
prejudice
,
breach
of
charity
and
of
Christian
union
,
so
much
keep
and
so
far
carry
on
among
us
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
another
plague
year
would
reconcile
all
these
difference
;
a
dose
converse
with
death
,
or
with
disease
that
threaten
death
,
would
scum
off
the
gall
from
our
temper
,
remove
the
animosity
among
us
,
and
bring
us
to
see
with
differ
eye
than
those
which
we
look
on
thing
with
before
.
<EOS>
as
the
people
who
have
be
use
to
join
with
the
Church
be
reconcile
at
this
time
with
the
admit
the
Dissenters
to
preach
to
them
,
so
the
Dissenters
,
who
with
an
uncommon
prejudice
have
break
off
from
the
communion
of
the
Church
of
England
,
be
now
content
to
come
to
their
parish
church
and
to
conform
to
the
worship
which
they
do
not
approve
of
before
;
but
as
the
terror
of
the
infection
abate
,
those
thing
all
return
again
to
their
less
desirable
channel
and
to
the
course
they
be
in
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
mention
this
but
historically
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
mind
to
enter
into
argument
to
move
either
or
both
side
to
a
more
charitable
compliance
one
with
another
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
that
it
be
probable
such
a
discourse
would
be
either
suitable
or
successful
;
the
breach
seem
rather
to
widen
,
and
tend
to
a
widening
further
,
than
to
closing
,
and
who
be
I
that
I
should
think
myself
able
to
influence
either
one
side
or
other
?
<EOS>
but
this
I
may
repeat
again
,
that
'
tis
evident
death
will
reconcile
us
all
;
on
the
other
side
the
grave
we
shall
be
all
brother
again
.
<EOS>
in
heaven
,
whither
I
hope
we
may
come
from
all
party
and
persuasion
,
we
shall
find
neither
prejudice
or
scruple
;
there
we
shall
be
of
one
principle
and
of
one
opinion
.
<EOS>
why
we
can
not
be
content
to
go
hand
in
hand
to
the
place
where
we
shall
join
heart
and
hand
without
the
least
hesitation
,
and
with
the
most
complete
harmony
and
affection
 
I
say
,
why
we
can
not
do
so
<EOS>
here
I
can
say
nothing
to
,
neither
<EOS>
shall
I
say
anything
more
of
it
but
<EOS>
that
it
remain
to
be
lament
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
dwell
a
great
while
upon
the
calamity
of
this
dreadful
time
,
and
go
on
to
describe
the
object
that
appear
among
us
every
day
,
the
dreadful
extravagancy
which
the
distraction
of
sick
people
drive
them
into
;
how
the
street
begin
now
to
be
full
of
frightful
object
,
and
family
to
be
make
even
a
terror
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
but
after
I
have
tell
you
,
as
I
have
above
,
that
one
man
,
be
tie
in
his
bed
,
and
find
no
other
way
to
deliver
himself
,
set
the
bed
on
fire
with
his
candle
,
which
unhappily
stand
within
his
reach
,
and
burn
himself
in
his
bed
;
and
how
another
,
by
the
insufferable
torment
he
bear
,
dance
and
sing
naked
in
the
street
,
not
know
one
ecstasy
from
another
;
I
say
,
after
I
have
mention
these
thing
,
what
can
be
add
more
?
<EOS>
what
can
be
say
to
represent
the
misery
of
these
time
more
lively
to
the
reader
,
or
to
give
him
a
more
perfect
idea
of
a
complicated
distress
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
that
this
time
be
terrible
,
that
I
be
sometimes
at
the
end
of
all
my
resolution
,
and
that
I
have
not
the
courage
that
I
have
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
as
the
extremity
bring
other
people
abroad
,
it
drive
me
home
,
and
except
have
make
my
voyage
down
to
Blackwall
and
Greenwich
,
as
I
have
relate
,
which
be
an
excursion
,
I
keep
afterwards
very
much
within
door
,
as
I
have
for
about
a
fortnight
before
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
already
that
I
repent
several
time
that
I
have
venture
to
stay
in
town
,
and
have
not
go
away
with
my
brother
and
his
family
,
but
it
be
too
late
for
that
now
;
and
after
I
have
retreat
and
stay
within
door
a
good
while
before
my
impatience
lead
me
abroad
,
then
they
call
me
,
as
I
have
say
,
to
an
ugly
and
dangerous
office
which
bring
me
out
again
;
but
as
that
be
expire
while
the
height
of
the
distemper
last
,
I
retire
again
,
and
continue
dose
ten
or
twelve
day
more
,
during
which
many
dismal
spectacle
represent
themselves
in
my
view
out
of
my
own
window
and
in
our
own
street
 
as
that
particularly
from
Harrow
Alley
,
of
the
poor
outrageous
creature
which
dance
and
sing
in
his
agony
;
and
many
other
there
be
.
<EOS>
Scarce
a
day
or
night
pass
over
but
some
dismal
thing
or
other
happen
at
the
end
of
that
Harrow
Alley
,
which
be
a
place
full
of
poor
people
,
most
of
them
belong
to
the
butcher
or
to
employment
depend
upon
the
butchery
.
  
<EOS>
sometimes
heap
and
throng
of
people
would
burst
out
of
the
alley
,
most
of
them
woman
,
make
a
dreadful
clamour
,
mix
or
compound
of
screech
,
cry
,
and
call
one
another
,
that
we
could
not
conceive
what
to
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
almost
all
the
dead
part
of
the
night
the
dead
-
cart
stand
at
the
end
of
that
alley
,
for
if
it
go
in
it
could
not
well
turn
again
,
and
could
go
in
but
a
little
way
.
<EOS>
there
,
I
say
,
it
stand
to
receive
dead
body
,
and
as
the
churchyard
be
but
a
little
way
off
,
if
it
go
away
full
it
would
soon
be
back
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
describe
the
most
horrible
cry
and
noise
the
poor
people
would
make
at
their
bring
the
dead
body
of
their
child
and
friend
out
of
the
cart
,
and
by
the
number
one
would
have
think
there
have
be
none
leave
behind
,
or
that
there
be
people
enough
for
a
small
city
live
in
those
place
.
<EOS>
several
time
they
cry
"
Murder
"
,
sometimes
"
Fire
"
;
but
it
be
easy
to
perceive
it
be
all
distraction
,
and
the
complaint
of
distressed
and
distemper
people
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
everywhere
thus
as
that
time
,
for
the
plague
rage
for
six
or
seven
week
beyond
all
that
I
have
express
,
and
come
even
to
such
a
height
that
,
in
the
extremity
,
they
begin
to
break
into
that
excellent
order
of
which
I
have
speak
so
much
in
behalf
of
the
magistrate
;
namely
,
that
no
dead
body
be
see
in
the
street
or
burial
in
the
daytime
:
<EOS>
for
there
be
a
necessity
in
this
extremity
to
bear
with
its
be
otherwise
for
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
I
can
not
omit
here
,
and
<EOS>
indeed
I
think
it
be
extraordinary
,
at
least
it
seem
a
remarkable
hand
of
Divine
justice
:
viz
.
,
that
all
the
predictor
,
astrologer
,
fortune
-
teller
,
and
what
they
call
cunning
-
man
,
conjurer
,
and
the
like
:
calculator
of
nativity
and
dreamer
of
dream
,
and
such
people
,
be
go
and
vanish
;
not
one
of
them
be
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
I
be
verily
persuade
that
a
great
number
of
them
fall
in
the
heat
of
the
calamity
,
have
venture
to
stay
upon
the
prospect
of
get
great
estate
;
and
indeed
their
gain
be
but
too
great
for
a
time
,
through
the
madness
and
folly
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
but
now
they
be
silent
;
many
of
them
go
to
their
long
home
,
not
able
to
foretell
their
own
fate
or
to
calculate
their
own
nativity
.
<EOS>
some
have
be
critical
enough
to
say
that
every
one
of
them
die
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
affirm
that
;
but
this
I
must
own
,
that
I
never
hear
of
one
of
them
that
ever
appear
after
the
calamity
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
particular
observation
during
this
dreadful
part
of
the
visitation
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
come
,
as
I
have
say
,
to
the
month
of
September
,
which
be
the
most
dreadful
of
its
kind
,
I
believe
,
that
ever
London
see
;
for
,
by
all
the
account
which
I
have
see
of
the
precede
visitation
which
have
be
in
London
,
nothing
have
be
like
it
,
the
number
in
the
weekly
bill
amount
to
almost
40,000
from
the
22nd
of
August
to
the
26th
of
September
,
being
but
five
week
.
<EOS>
the
particular
of
the
bill
be
as
follow
,
viz

<EOS>
this
be
a
prodigious
number
of
itself
,
but
if
I
should
add
the
reason
which
I
have
to
believe
that
this
account
be
deficient
,
and
how
deficient
it
be
,
you
would
,
with
me
,
make
no
scruple
to
believe
that
there
die
above
ten
thousand
a
week
for
all
those
week
,
one
week
with
another
,
and
a
proportion
for
several
week
both
before
and
after
.
<EOS>
the
confusion
among
the
people
,
especially
within
the
city
,
at
that
time
,
be
inexpressible
.
<EOS>
the
terror
be
so
great
at
last
that
the
courage
of
the
people
appoint
to
carry
away
the
dead
begin
to
fail
them
;
nay
,
several
of
them
die
,
although
they
have
the
distemper
before
and
be
recover
,
and
some
of
them
drop
down
when
they
have
be
carry
the
body
even
at
the
pit
side
,
and
just
ready
to
throw
them
in
;
and
this
confusion
be
great
in
the
city
because
they
have
flatter
themselves
with
hope
of
escaping
,
and
think
the
bitterness
of
death
be
past
.
<EOS>
one
cart
,
they
tell
us
,
go
up
Shoreditch
be
forsake
of
the
driver
,
or
be
leave
to
one
man
to
drive
,
he
die
in
the
street
;
and
the
horse
go
on
overthrow
the
cart
,
and
leave
the
body
,
some
throw
out
here
,
some
there
,
in
a
dismal
manner
.
<EOS>
another
cart
be
,
it
seem
,
find
in
the
great
pit
in
Finsbury
Fields
,
the
driver
be
dead
,
or
have
be
go
and
abandon
it
,
and
the
horse
run
too
near
it
,
the
cart
fall
in
and
draw
the
horse
in
also
.
<EOS>
It
be
suggest
that
the
driver
be
throw
in
with
it
and
that
the
cart
fall
upon
him
,
by
reason
his
whip
be
see
to
be
in
the
pit
among
the
body
;
but
that
,
I
suppose
,
could
not
be
certain
.
  
<EOS>
in
our
parish
of
Aldgate
the
dead
-
cart
be
several
time
,
as
I
have
hear
,
find
stand
at
the
churchyard
gate
full
of
dead
body
,
but
neither
bellman
or
driver
or
any
one
else
with
it
;
neither
in
these
or
many
other
case
<EOS>
do
they
know
what
body
they
have
in
their
cart
,
for
sometimes
they
be
let
down
with
rope
out
of
balcony
and
out
of
window
,
and
sometimes
the
bearer
bring
them
to
the
cart
,
sometimes
other
people
;
nor
,
as
the
man
themselves
say
,
do
they
trouble
themselves
to
keep
any
account
of
the
number
.
  
<EOS>
the
vigilance
of
the
magistrate
be
now
put
to
the
utmost
trial
 
and
,
it
must
be
confess
,
can
never
be
enough
acknowledge
on
this
occasion
also
;
whatever
expense
or
trouble
they
be
at
,
two
thing
be
never
neglect
in
the
city
or
suburb
either
:
    
<EOS>

provision
be
always
to

and
the
price
not
much

neither
,
hardly
worth

<EOS>
no
dead
body
lay
unburied
or
uncover
;
and
if
one
walk
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
another
,
no
funeral
or
sign
of
it
be
to
be
see
in
the
daytime
,
except
a
little
,
as
I
have
say
above
,
in
the
three
first
week
in
September
.
  
<EOS>
this
last
article
perhaps
will
hardly
be
believe
when
some
account
which
other
have
publish
since
that
shall
be
see
,
wherein
they
say
that
the
dead
lie
unburied
,
which
I
be
assure
be
utterly
false
;
at
least
,
if
it
have
be
anywhere
so
,
it
must
have
be
in
house
where
the
living
be
go
from
the
dead
(
have
find
mean
,
as
I
have
observe
,
to
escape
)
and
where
no
notice
be
give
to
the
officer
.
<EOS>
all
which
amount
to
nothing
at
all
in
the
case
in
hand
;
for
this
I
be
positive
in
,
have
myself
be
employ
a
little
in
the
direction
of
that
part
in
the
parish
in
which
I
live
,
and
where
as
great
a
desolation
be
make
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
inhabitant
as
be
anywhere
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
I
be
sure
that
there
be
no
dead
body
remain
unburied
;
that
be
to
say
,
none
that
the
proper
officer
know
of
;
none
for
want
of
people
to
carry
them
off
,
and
burier
to
put
them
into
the
ground
and
cover
them
;
and
this
be
sufficient
to
the
argument
;
for
what
may
lie
in
house
and
hole
,
as
in
Moses
and
Aaron
Alley
,
be
nothing
;
for
it
be
most
certain
they
be
bury
as
soon
as
they
be
find
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
first
article
(
namely
,
of
provision
,
the
scarcity
or
dearness
)
,
though
I
have
mention
it
before
and
shall
speak
of
it
again
,
yet
I
must
observe
here
:
    
(
1
)
<EOS>
the
price
of
bread
in
particular
be
not
much
raise
;
for
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
,
viz
.
,
in
the
first
week
in
March
,
the
penny
wheaten
loaf
be
ten
ounce
and
a
half
;
and
in
the
height
of
the
contagion
it
be
to
be
have
at
nine
ounce
and
a
half
,
and
never
dearer
,
no
,
not
all
that
season
.
<EOS>
and
about
the
beginning
of
November
it
be
sell
ten
ounce
and
a
half
again
;
the
like
of
which
,
I
believe
,
be
never
hear
of
in
any
city
,
under
so
dreadful
a
visitation
,
before
.
  
<EOS>
(
2
)
neither
be
there
(
which
I
wonder
much
at
)
any
want
of
baker
or
oven
keep
open
to
supply
the
people
with
the
bread
;
but
this
be
indeed
allege
by
some
family
,
viz
.
,
that
their
maidservant
,
go
to
the
bakehouse
with
their
dough
to
be
bake
,
which
be
then
the
custom
,
sometimes
come
home
with
the
sickness
(
that
be
to
say
the
plague
)
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
this
dreadful
visitation
there
be
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
but
two
pest
-
house
make
use
of
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
one
in
the
field
beyond
Old
Street
and
one
in
Westminster
;
neither
be
there
any
compulsion
use
in
carry
people
thither
.
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
no
need
of
compulsion
in
the
case
,
for
there
be
thousand
of
poor
distressed
people
who
,
have
no
help
or
convenience
or
supply
but
of
charity
,
would
have
be
very
glad
to
have
be
carry
thither
and
be
take
care
of
;
which
,
indeed
,
be
the
only
thing
that
I
think
be
want
in
the
whole
public
management
of
the
city
,
see
nobody
be
here
allow
to
be
bring
to
the
pest
-
house
but
where
money
be
give
,
or
security
for
money
,
either
at
their
introducing
or
upon
their
be
cure
and
send
out
 
for
very
many
be
send
out
again
whole
;
and
very
good
physician
be
appoint
to
those
place
,
so
that
many
people
do
very
well
there
,
of
which
I
shall
make
mention
again
.
<EOS>
the
principal
sort
of
people
send
thither
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
servant
who
get
the
distemper
by
go
of
errand
to
fetch
necessary
to
the
family
where
they
live
,
and
who
in
that
case
,
if
they
come
home
sick
,
be
remove
to
preserve
the
rest
of
the
house
;
and
they
be
so
well
look
after
there
in
all
the
time
of
the
visitation
that
there
be
but
156
bury
in
all
at
the
London
pest
-
house
,
and
159
at
that
of
Westminster
.
  
<EOS>
by
have
more
pest
-
house
I
be
far
from
mean
a
force
all
people
into
such
place
.
<EOS>
have
the
shutting
up
of
house
be
omit
and
the
sick
hurry
out
of
their
dwelling
to
pest
-
house
,
as
some
propose
,
it
seem
,
at
that
time
as
well
as
since
,
it
would
certainly
have
be
much
bad
than
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
very
remove
the
sick
would
have
be
a
spreading
of
the
infection
,
and
the
rather
because
that
remove
could
not
effectually
clear
the
house
where
the
sick
person
be
of
the
distemper
;
and
the
rest
of
the
family
,
be
then
leave
at
liberty
,
would
certainly
spread
it
among
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
method
also
in
private
family
,
which
would
have
be
universally
use
to
have
conceal
the
distemper
and
to
have
conceal
the
person
be
sick
,
would
have
be
such
that
the
distemper
would
sometimes
have
seize
a
whole
family
before
any
visitor
or
examiner
could
have
know
of
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
prodigious
number
which
would
have
be
sick
at
a
time
would
have
exceed
all
the
capacity
of
public
pest
-
house
to
receive
them
,
or
of
public
officer
to
discover
and
remove
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
well
consider
in
those
day
,
and
I
have
hear
them
talk
of
it
often
.
<EOS>
the
magistrate
have
enough
to
do
to
bring
people
to
submit
to
have
their
house
shut
up
,
and
many
way
they
deceive
the
watchman
and
get
out
,
as
I
have
observe
.
<EOS>
but
that
difficulty
make
it
apparent
that
they
t
would
have
find
it
impracticable
to
have
go
the
other
way
to
work
,
for
they
could
never
have
force
the
sick
people
out
of
their
bed
and
out
of
their
dwelling
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
have
be
my
Lord
Mayor
's
officer
,
but
an
army
of
officer
,
that
must
have
attempt
it
;
and
the
people
,
on
the
other
hand
,
would
have
be
enrage
and
desperate
,
and
would
have
kill
those
that
should
have
offer
to
have
meddle
with
them
or
with
their
child
and
relation
,
whatever
have
befall
them
for
it
;
so
that
they
would
have
make
the
people
,
who
,
as
it
be
,
be
in
the
most
terrible
distraction
imaginable
,
I
say
,
they
would
have
make
them
stark
mad
;
whereas
the
magistrate
find
it
proper
on
several
account
to
treat
them
with
lenity
and
compassion
,
and
not
with
violence
and
terror
,
such
as
drag
the
sick
out
of
their
house
or
oblige
them
to
remove
themselves
,
would
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
this
lead
me
again
to
mention
the
time
when
the
plague
first
begin
;
that
be
to
say
,
when
it
become
certain
that
it
would
spread
over
the
whole
town
,
when
,
as
I
have
say
,
the
well
sort
of
people
first
take
the
alarm
and
begin
to
hurry
themselves
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
as
I
observe
in
its
place
,
that
the
throng
be
so
great
,
and
the
coach
,
horse
,
waggon
,
and
cart
be
so
many
,
drive
and
drag
the
people
away
,
that
it
look
as
if
all
the
city
be
run
away
;
and
have
any
regulation
be
publish
that
have
be
terrify
at
that
time
,
especially
such
as
would
pretend
to
dispose
of
the
people
otherwise
than
they
would
dispose
of
themselves
,
it
would
have
put
both
the
city
and
suburb
into
the
utmost
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
magistrate
wisely
cause
the
people
to
be
encourage
,
make
very
good
bye
-
law
for
the
regulating
the
citizen
,
keep
good
order
in
the
street
,
and
make
everything
as
eligible
as
possible
to
all
sort
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
the
Lord
Mayor
and
the
sheriff
,
the
Court
of
Aldermen
,
and
a
certain
number
of
the
Common
Council
man
,
or
their
deputy
,
come
to
a
resolution
and
publish
it
,
viz
.
,
that
they
would
not
quit
the
city
themselves
,
but
that
they
would
be
always
at
hand
for
the
preserve
good
order
in
every
place
and
for
the
do
justice
on
all
occasion
;
as
also
for
the
distribute
the
public
charity
to
the
poor
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
for
the
do
the
duty
and
discharge
the
trust
repose
in
them
by
the
citizen
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
.
  
<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
these
order
,
the
Lord
Mayor
,
sheriffs
,
&
c.
,
hold
council
every
day
,
more
or
less
,
for
make
such
disposition
as
they
find
needful
for
preserve
the
civil
peace
;
and
though
they
use
the
people
with
all
possible
gentleness
and
clemency
,
yet
all
manner
of
presumptuous
rogue
such
as
thief
,
housebreaker
,
plunderer
of
the
dead
or
of
the
sick
,
be
duly
punish
,
and
several
declaration
be
continually
publish
by
the
Lord
Mayor
and
Court
of
Aldermen
against
such
.
  
<EOS>
also
all
constable
and
churchwarden
be
enjoin
to
stay
in
the
city
upon
severe
penalty
,
or
to
depute
such
able
and
sufficient
housekeeper
as
the
deputy
alderman
or
Common
Council
man
of
the
precinct
should
approve
,
and
for
whom
they
should
give
security
;
and
also
security
in
case
of
mortality
that
they
would
forthwith
constitute
other
constable
in
their
stead
.
  
<EOS>
these
thing
re
-
establish
the
mind
of
the
people
very
much
,
especially
in
the
first
of
their
fright
,
when
they
talk
of
make
so
universal
a
flight
that
the
city
would
have
be
in
danger
of
be
entirely
desert
of
its
inhabitant
except
the
poor
,
and
the
country
of
be
plunder
and
lay
waste
by
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
magistrate
deficient
in
perform
their
part
as
boldly
as
they
promise
it
;
for
my
Lord
Mayor
and
the
sheriff
be
continually
in
the
street
and
at
place
of
the
great
danger
,
and
though
they
do
not
care
for
have
too
great
a
resort
of
people
crowd
about
them
,
yet
in
emergent
case
they
never
deny
the
people
access
to
them
,
and
hear
with
patience
all
their
grievance
and
complaint
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
Mayor
have
a
low
gallery
build
on
purpose
in
his
hall
,
where
he
stand
a
little
remove
from
the
crowd
when
any
complaint
come
to
be
hear
,
that
he
may
appear
with
as
much
safety
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
likewise
the
proper
officer
,
call
my
Lord
Mayor
's
officer
,
constantly
attend
in
their
turn
,
as
they
be
in
wait
;
and
if
any
of
them
be
sick
or
infect
,
as
some
of
them
be
,
other
be
instantly
employ
to
fill
up
and
officiate
in
their
place
till
it
be
know
whether
the
other
should
live
or
die
.
  
<EOS>
in
like
manner
the
sheriff
and
aldermen
do
in
their
several
station
and
ward
,
where
they
be
place
by
office
,
and
the
sheriff
's
officer
or
sergeant
be
appoint
to
receive
order
from
the
respective
alderman
in
their
turn
,
so
that
justice
be
execute
in
all
case
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
it
be
one
of
their
particular
care
to
see
the
order
for
the
freedom
of
the
market
observe
,
and
in
this
part
either
the
Lord
Mayor
or
one
or
both
of
the
sheriff
be
every
market
-
day
on
horseback
to
see
their
order
execute
and
to
see
that
the
country
people
have
all
possible
encouragement
and
freedom
in
their
come
to
the
market
and
go
back
again
,
and
that
no
nuisance
or
frightful
object
should
be
see
in
the
street
to
terrify
them
or
make
them
unwilling
to
come
.
<EOS>
also
the
baker
be
take
under
particular
order
,
and
the
Master
of
the
Bakers
'
Company
be
,
with
his
court
of
assistant
,
direct
to
see
the
order
of
my
Lord
Mayor
for
their
regulation
put
in
execution
,
and
the
due
assize
of
bread
(
which
be
weekly
appoint
by
my
Lord
Mayor
)
observe
;
and
all
the
baker
be
oblige
to
keep
their
oven
go
constantly
,
on
pain
of
lose
the
privilege
of
a
freeman
of
the
city
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
mean
bread
be
always
to
be
have
in
plenty
,
and
as
cheap
as
usual
,
as
I
say
above
;
and
provision
be
never
want
in
the
market
,
even
to
such
a
degree
that
I
often
wonder
at
it
,
and
reproach
myself
with
be
so
timorous
and
cautious
in
stir
abroad
,
when
the
country
people
come
freely
and
boldly
to
market
,
as
if
there
have
be
no
manner
of
infection
in
the
city
,
or
danger
of
catch
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
.
<EOS>
be
indeed
one
admirable
piece
of
conduct
in
the
say
magistrate
that
the
street
be
keep
constantly
dear
and
free
from
all
manner
of
frightful
object
,
dead
body
,
or
any
such
thing
as
be
indecent
or
unpleasant
 
unless
where
anybody
fall
down
suddenly
or
die
in
the
street
,
as
I
have
say
above
;
and
these
be
generally
cover
with
some
cloth
or
blanket
,
or
remove
into
the
next
churchyard
till
night
.
<EOS>
all
the
needful
work
that
carry
terror
with
them
,
that
be
both
dismal
and
dangerous
,
be
do
in
the
night
;
if
any
disease
body
be
remove
,
or
dead
body
bury
,
or
infect
clothe
burn
,
it
be
do
in
the
night
;
and
all
the
body
which
be
throw
into
the
great
pit
in
the
several
churchyard
or
burying
-
ground
,
as
have
be
observe
,
be
so
remove
in
the
night
,
and
everything
be
cover
and
close
before
day
.
<EOS>
so
that
in
the
daytime
there
be
not
the
least
signal
of
the
calamity
to
be
see
or
hear
of
,
except
what
be
to
be
observe
from
the
emptiness
of
the
street
,
and
sometimes
from
the
passionate
outcry
and
lamentation
of
the
people
,
out
at
their
window
,
and
from
the
number
of
house
and
shop
shut
up
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
the
silence
and
emptiness
of
the
street
so
much
in
the
city
as
in
the
out
-
part
,
except
just
at
one
particular
time
when
,
as
I
have
mention
,
the
plague
come
east
and
spread
over
all
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
merciful
disposition
of
God
,
that
as
the
plague
begin
at
one
end
of
the
town
first
(
as
have
be
observe
at
large
)
so
it
proceed
progressively
to
other

<EOS>
this
cause
the
reputation
of
the
city
's
health
to
continue
all
over
England
 
and
especially
in
the
county
and
market
adjacent
,
from
whence
<EOS>
our
supply
of
provision
chiefly
come
even
much
long
than
that
health
itself
continue
;
for
when
the
people
come
into
the
street
from
the
country
by
Shoreditch
and
Bishopsgate
,
or
by
Old
Street
and
Smithfield
,
they
would
see
the
out

street
empty
and
the
house
and
shop
shut
,
and
the
few
people
that
be
stir
there
walk
in
the
middle
of

street
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
come
within
the
city
,
there
thing
look
better
,
and
the
market
and
shop
be
open
,
and
the
people
walk
about
the
street
as
usual
,
though
not
quite
so
many
;
and
this
continue
till
the
latter
end
of
August
and
the
beginning
of
September
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
the
case
alter
quite
;
the
distemper
abate
in
the
west
and
north
-
west
parish
,
and
the
weight
of
the
infection
lie
on
the
city
and
the
eastern
suburbs
,
and
the
southwark
side
,
and
this
in
a
frightful
manner
.
<EOS>
then
,
indeed
,
the
city
begin
to
look
dismal
,
shop
to
be
shut
,
and
the
street
desolate
.
<EOS>
in
the
High
Street
,
indeed
,
necessity
make
people
stir
abroad
on
many
occasion
;
and
there
would
be
in
the
middle
of
the

a
pretty
many
people
,
but
in
the
morning

evening
scarce
any

even

no

not

these

and
now
the
misery
of
the
city
and
of

said
east
and
south
part
be
complete
indeed
;
for
,
as
you
see
,
the
weight
of
the
distemper
lie
upon
those
part
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
city
,
the
eight
parish
over
the
river
,
with
the
parish
of
Aldgate
,
Whitechappel
,
and
Stepney
;
and
this
be
the
time
that
the
bill
come
up
to
such
a
monstrous
height
as
that
I
mention
before
,
and
that
eight
or
nine
,
and
,
as
I
believe
,
ten
or
twelve
thousand
a
week
,
die
;
for
it
be
my
settled
opinion
that
they
never
could
come
at
any
just
account
of
the
number
,
for
the
reason
which
I
have
give
already
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
one
of
the
most
eminent
physician
,
who
have
since
publish
in
Latin
an
account
of
those
time
,
and
of
his
observation
say
that
in
one
week
there
die
twelve
thousand
people
,
and
that
particularly
there
die
four
thousand
in
one
night
;
though
I
do
not
remember
that
there
ever
be
any
such
particular
night
so
remarkably
fatal
as
that
such
a
number
die
in
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
all
this
confirm
what
I
have
say
above
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
bill
of
mortality
,
&
c.
,
of
which
I
shall
say
more
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
let
me
take
leave
to
enter
again
,
though
it
may
seem
a
repetition
of
circumstance
,
into
a
description
of
the
miserable
condition
of
the
city
itself
,
and
of
those
part
where
I
live
at
this
particular
time
.
<EOS>
the
city
and
those
other
part
,
notwithstanding
the
great
number
of
people
that
be
go
into
the
country
,
be
vastly
full
of
people
;
and
perhaps
the
full
because
people
have
for
a
long
time
a
strong
belief
that
the
plague
would
not
come
into
the
city
,
nor
into
Southwark
,
no
,
nor
into
Wapping
or
Ratcliff
at
all
;
nay
,
such
be
the
assurance
of
the
people
on
that
head
that
many
remove
from
the
suburb
on
the
west
and
north
side
,
into
those
eastern
and
south
side
as
for
safety
;
and
,
as
I
verily
believe
,
carry
the
plague
amongst
them
there
perhaps
sooner
than
they
would
otherwise
have
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
here
also
I
ought
to
leave
a
further
remark
for
the
use
of
posterity
,
concern
the
manner
of
people
's
infect
one
another
;
namely
,
that
it
be
not
the
sick
people
only
from
whom
the
plague
be
immediately
receive
by
other
that
be
sound
,
but
the
well
.
<EOS>
to
explain
myself
:
by
the
sick
people
I
mean
those
who
be
know
to
be
sick
,
have
take
their
bed
,
have
be
under
cure
,
or
have
swelling
and
tumour
upon
them
,
and
the
like
;
these
everybody
could
beware
of
;
they
be
either
in
their
bed
or
in
such
condition
as
could
not
be
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
well
<EOS>
I
mean
such
as
have
receive
the
contagion
,
and
have
it
really
upon
them
,
and
in
their
blood
,
yet
do
not
show
the
consequence
of
it
in
their
countenance
<EOS>
:
nay
,
even
be
not
sensible
of
it
themselves
,
as
many
be
not
for
several
day
.
<EOS>
these
breathe
death
in
every
place
,
and
upon
everybody
who
come
near
them
;
nay
,
their
very
clothe
retain
the
infection
,
their
hand
would
infect
the
thing
they
touch
,
especially
if
they
be
warm
and
sweaty
,
and
they
be
generally
apt
to
sweat
too
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
impossible
to
know
these
people
,
nor
do
they
sometimes
,
as
I
have
say
,
know
themselves
to
be
infect
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
people
that
so
often
drop
down
and
faint
in
the
street
;
for
oftentime
they
would
go
about
the
street
to
the
last
,
till
on
a
sudden
they
would
sweat
,
grow
faint
,
sit
down
at
a
door
and
die
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
find
themselves
thus
,
they
would
struggle
hard
to
get
home
to
their
own
door
,
or
at
other
time
would
be
just
able
to
go
into
their
house
and
die
instantly
;
other
time
they
would
go
about
till
they
have
<EOS>
the
very
token
come
out
upon
them
,
and
yet
not
know
it
,
and
would
die
in
an
hour
or
two
after
they
come
home
,
but
be
well
as
long
as
they
be
abroad
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
dangerous
people
;
these
be
the
people
of
whom
the
well
people
ought
to
have
be
afraid
;
but
then
,
on
the
other
side
,
it
be
impossible
to
know
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
reason
why
it
be
impossible
in
a
visitation
to
prevent
the
spreading
of
the
plague
by
the
utmost
human
vigilance
:
viz
.
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
know
the
infected
people
from
the
sound
,
or
that
the
infected
people
should
perfectly
know
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
man
who
converse
freely
in
London
all
the
season
of
the
plague
in
1665
,
and
keep
about
him
an
antidote
or
cordial
on
purpose
to
take
when
he
think
himself
in
any
danger
,
and
he
have
such
a
rule
to
know
or
have
warning
of
the
danger
by
as
indeed
<EOS>
I
never
meet
with
before
or
since
.
<EOS>
how
far
it
may
be
depend
on
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
wound
in
his
leg
,
and
whenever
he
come
among
any
people
that
be
not
sound
,
and
the
infection
begin
to
affect
him
,
he
say
he
could
know
it
by
that
signal
,
viz
.
,
that
his
wound
in
his
leg
would
smart
,
and
look
pale
and
white
;
so
as
soon
as
ever
he
feel
it
smart
it
be
time
for
him
to
withdraw
,
or
to
take
care
of
himself
,
take
his
drink
,
which
he
always
carry
about
him
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
now
it
seem
he
find
his
wound
would
smart
many
time
when
he
be
in
company
with
such
who
think
themselves
to
be
sound
,
and
who
appear
so
to
one
another
;
but
he
would
presently
rise
up
and
say
publicly
,
"
friend
,
here
be
somebody
in
the
room
that
have
the
plague
"
,
and
so
would
immediately
break
up
the
company
.
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
a
faithful
monitor
to
all
people
that
the
plague
be
not
to
be
avoid
by
those
that
converse
promiscuously
in
a
town
infect
,
and
people
have
it
when
they
know
it
not
,
and
that
they
likewise
give
it
to
other
when
they
know
not
that
they
have
it
themselves
;
and
in
this
case
shut
up
the
well
or
remove
the
sick
will
not
do
it
,
unless
they
can
go
back
and
shut
up
all
those
that
the
sick
have
converse
with
,
even
before
they
know
themselves
to
be
sick
,
and
none
know
how
far
to
carry
that
back
,
or
where
to
stop
;
for
none
know
when
or
where
or
how
they
may
have
receive
the
infection
,
or
from
whom
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
take
to
be
the
reason
which
make
so
many
people
talk
of
the
air
be
corrupt
and
infect
,
and
that
they
need
not
be
cautious
of
whom
<EOS>
they
converse
with
,
for
that
the
contagion
be
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
them
in
strange
agitation
and
surprise
on
this
account
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
come
near
any
infected
body
"
,
say
the
disturbed
person
;
"
I
have
converse
with
none
but
sound
,
healthy
people
,
and
yet
I
have
get
the
distemper
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
be
strike
from
Heaven
"
,
say
another
,
and
he
fall
to
the
serious
part
.
<EOS>
again
,
the
first
go
on
exclaim
,
"
I
have
come
near
no
infection
or
any
infected
person
;
I
be
sure
it
be
the
air
.
<EOS>
We
draw
in
death
when
we
breathe
,
and
therefore
'
tis
the
hand
of
God
;
there
be
no
withstand
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
at
last
make
many
people
,
be
harden
to
the
danger
,
grow
less
concerned
at
it
;
and
less
cautious
towards
the
latter
end
of
the
time
,
and
when
it
be
come
to
its
height
,
than
they
be
at
first
.
<EOS>
then
,
with
a
kind
of
a
turkish
predestinarianism
,
they
would
say
,
if
it
please
God
to
strike
them
,
it
be
all
one
whether
they
go
abroad
or
stay
at
home
;
they
could
not
escape
it
,
and
therefore
they
go
boldly
about
,
even
into
infected
house
and
infect
company
;
visit
sick
people
;
and
,
in
short
,
lie
in
the
bed
with
their
wife
or
relation
when
they
be
infect
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
the
consequence
,
but
the
same
that
be
the
consequence
in
Turkey
,
and
in
those
country
where
they
do
those
thing
 
namely
,
that
they
be
infect
too
,
and
die
by
hundred
and
thousand
?
  
<EOS>
I
would
be
far
from
lessen
the
awe
of
the
judgement
of
God
and
the
reverence
to
His
providence
which
ought
always
to
be
on
our
mind
on
such
occasion
as
these
.
<EOS>
doubtless
the
visitation
itself
be
a
stroke
from
Heaven
upon
a
city
,
or
country
,
or
nation
where
it
fall
;
a
messenger
of
His
vengeance
,
and
a
loud
call
to
that
nation
or
country
or
city
to
humiliation
and
repentance
,
accord
to
that
of
the
prophet
Jeremiah
(
xviii
.
7
,
8)
:
"
at
what
instant
I
shall
speak
concern
a
nation
,
and
concern
a
kingdom
,
to
pluck
up
,
and
to
pull
down
,
and
to
destroy
it
;
if
that
nation
against
whom
I
have
pronounce
turn
from
their
evil
,
I
will
repent
of
the
evil
that
I
think
to
do
unto
them
.
"
<EOS>
now
to
prompt
due
impression
of
the
awe
of
God
on
the
mind
of
man
on
such
occasion
,
and
not
to
lessen
them
,
it
be
that
I
have
leave
those
minute
upon
record
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
therefore
,
I
reflect
upon
no
man
for
put
the
reason
of
those
thing
upon
the
immediate
hand
of
God
,
and
the
appointment
and
direction
of
His
providence
;
nay
,
on
the
contrary
,
there
be
many
wonderful
deliverance
of
person
from
infection
,
and
deliverance
of
person
when
infect
,
which
intimate
singular
and
remarkable
providence
in
the
particular
instance
to
which
they
refer
;
<EOS>
and
I
esteem
my
own
deliverance
to
be
one
next
to
miraculous
,
and
do
record
it
with
thankfulness
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
I
be
speak
of
the
plague
as
a
distemper
arise
from
natural
cause
,
we
must
consider
it
as
it
be
really
propagate
by
natural
mean
;
nor
be
it
at
all
the
less
a
judgement
for
its
being
under
the
conduct
of
human
cause
and
effect
;
for
,
as
the
Divine
Power
have
form
the
whole
scheme
of
nature
and
maintain
nature
in
its
course
,
so
the
same
Power
think
fit
to
let
His
own
acting
with
man
,
whether
of
mercy
or
judgement
,
to
go
on
in
the
ordinary
course
of
natural
cause
;
and
He
be
pleased
to
act
by
those
natural
cause
as
the
ordinary
mean
,
except
and
reserve
to
Himself
nevertheless
a
power
to
act
in
a
supernatural
way
when
He
see
occasion
.
<EOS>
now
'
tis
evident
that
in
the
case
of
an
infection
there
be
no
apparent
extraordinary
occasion
for
supernatural
operation
,
but
the
ordinary
course
of
thing
appear
sufficiently
armed
,
and
make
capable
of
all
the
effect
that
Heaven
usually
direct
by
a
contagion
.
<EOS>
among
these
cause
and
effect
,
this
of
the
secret
conveyance
of
infection
,
imperceptible
and
unavoidable
,
be
more
than
sufficient
to
execute
the
fierceness
of
Divine
vengeance
,
without
put
it
upon
supernatural
and
miracle
.
  
<EOS>
the
acute
penetrating
nature
of
the
disease
itself
be
such
,
and
the
infection
be
receive
so
imperceptibly
,
that
the
most
exact
caution
could
not
secure
us
while
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
be
allow
to
believe
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
so
many
example
fresh
in
my
memory
to
convince
me
of
it
,
that
I
think
none
can
resist
their
evidence
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
must
be
allow
to
believe
that
no
one
in
this
whole
nation
ever
receive
the
sickness
or
infection
but
who
receive
it
in
the
ordinary
way
of
infection
from
somebody
,
or
the
clothe
or
touch
or
stench
of
somebody
that
be
infect
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
manner
of
its
come
first
to
London
prove
this
also
,
viz
.
,
by
good
bring
over
from
Holland
,
and
bring
thither
from
the
Levant
;
the
first
breaking
of
it
out
in
a
house
in
Long
Acre
where
those
good
be
carry
and
first
open
;
its
spreading
from
that
house
to
other
house
by
the
visible
unwary
converse
with
those
who
be
sick
;
and
the
infect
the
parish
officer
who
be
employ
about
the
person
dead
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
these
be
know
authority
for
this
great
foundation
point
 
that
it
go
on
and
proceed
from
person
to
person
and
from
house
to
house
,
and
no
otherwise
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
house
that
be
infect
there
die
four
person
.
<EOS>
a
neighbour
,
hear
the
mistress
of
the
first
house
be
sick
,
go
to
visit
her
,
and
go
home
and
give
the
distemper
to
her
family
,
and
die
,
and
all
her
household
.
<EOS>
a
minister
,
call
to
pray
with
the
first
sick
person
in
the
second
house
,
be
say
to
sicken
immediately
and
die
with
several
more
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
then
the
physician
begin
to
consider
,
for
they
do
not
at
first
dream
of
a
general
contagion
.
<EOS>
but
the
physician
be
send
to
inspect
the
body
,
they
assure
the
people
that
it
be
neither
more
or
less
than
the
plague
,
with
all
its
terrifying
particular
,
and
that
it
threaten
an
universal
infection
,
so
many
people
have
already
converse
with
the
sick
or
distemper
,
and
have
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
receive
infection
from
them
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
put
a
stop
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
opinion
of
the
physician
agree
with
my
observation
afterwards
,
namely
,
that
the
danger
be
spread
insensibly
,
for
the
sick
could
infect
none
but
those
that
come
within
reach
of
the
sick
person
;
but
that
one
man
who
may
have
really
receive
the
infection
and
know
it
not
,
but
go
abroad
and
about
as
a
sound
person
,
may
give
the
plague
to
a
thousand
people
,
and
they
to
great
number
in
proportion
,
and
neither
the
person
give
the
infection
or
the
person
receive
it
know
anything
of
it
,
and
perhaps
not
feel
the
effect
of
it
for
several
day
after
.
  
<EOS>
for
example
,
many
person
in
the
time
of
this
visitation
never
perceive
that
they
be
infect
till
they
find
to
their
unspeakable
surprise
,
the
token
come
out
upon
them
;
after
which
they
seldom
live
six
hour
;
for
those
spot
they
call
the
token
be
really
gangrene
spot
,
or
mortify
flesh
in
small
knob
as
broad
as
a
little
silver
penny
,
and
hard
as
a
piece
of
callus
or
horn
;
so
that
,
when
the
disease
be
come
up
to
that
length
,
there
be
nothing
could
follow
but
certain
death
;
and
yet
,
as
I
say
,
they
know
nothing
of
their
be
infect
,
nor
find
themselves
so
much
as
out
of
order
,
till
those
mortal
mark
be
upon
them
.
<EOS>
but
everybody
must
allow
that
they
be
infect
in
a
high
degree
before
,
and
must
have
be
so
some
time
,
and
consequently
their
breath
,
their
sweat
,
their
very
clothe
,
be
contagious
for
many
day
before
.
<EOS>
this
occasion
a
vast
variety
of
case
which
physician
would
have
much
more
opportunity
to
remember
than
I
;
but
some
come
within
the
compass
of
my
observation
or
hearing
,
of
which
I
shall
name
a
few
.
  
<EOS>
a
certain
citizen
who
have
live
safe
and
untouched
till
the
month
of
September
,
when
the
weight
of
the
distemper
lie
more
in
the
city
than
it
have
do
before
,
be
mighty
cheerful
,
and
something
too
bold
(
as
I
think
it
be
)
in
his
talk
of
how
secure
he
be
,
how
cautious
he
have
be
,
and
how
he
have
never
come
near
any
sick
body
.
<EOS>
say
another
citizen
,
a
neighbour
of
his
,
to
him
one
day
,
"
do
not
be
too
confident
,
<EOS>
Mr
 
;
it
be
hard
to
say
who
be
sick
and
who
be
well
,
for
we
see
man
alive
and
well
to
outward
appearance
one
hour
,
and
dead
the
next
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
"
,
say
the
first
man
,
for
he
be
not
a
man
presumptuously
secure
,
but
have
escape
a
long
while
 
and
man
,
as
I
say
above
,
especially
in
the
city
begin
to
be
over
-
easy
upon
that
score
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
do
not
think
myself
secure
,
but
I
hope
I
have
not
be
in
company
with
any
person
that
there
have
be
any
danger
in
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
?
"
say
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
be
not
you
at
the
Bull
Head
Tavern
in
Gracechurch
Street
with
Mr
 
the
night
before
last
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
first
,
"
I
be
;
but
there
be
nobody
there
that
we
have
any
reason
to
think
dangerous
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
upon
which
his
neighbour
say
no
more
,
be
unwilling
to
surprise
him
;
but
this
make
him
more
inquisitive
,
and
as
his
neighbour
appear
backward
,
he
be
the
more
impatient
,
and
in
a
kind
of
warmth
say
he
aloud
,
"
why
,
he
be
not
dead
,
be
he
?
"
<EOS>
upon
which
his
neighbour
still
be
silent
,
but
cast
up
his
eye
and
say
something
to
himself
;
at
which
the
first
citizen
turn
pale
,
and
say
no
more
but
this
,
"
then
I
be
a
dead
man
too
"
,
and
go
home
immediately
and
send
for
a
neighbouring
apothecary
to
give
him
something
preventive
,
for
he
have
not
yet
find
himself
ill
;
but
the
apothecary
,
open
his
breast
,
fetch
a
sigh
,
and
say
no
more
but
this
,
"
look
up
to
God
"
;
and
the
man
die
in
a
few
hour
.
  
<EOS>
now
let
any
man
judge
from
a
case
like
this
if
it
be
possible
for
the
regulation
of
magistrate
,
either
by
shut
up
the
sick
or
remove
them
,
to
stop
an
infection
which
spread
itself
from
man
to
man
even
while
they
be
perfectly
well
and
insensible
of
its
approach
,
and
may
be
so
for
many
day
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
proper
to
ask
here
how
long
it
may
be
suppose
man
may
have
the
seed
of
the
contagion
in
them
before
it
discover
itself
in
this
fatal
manner
,
and
how
long
they
may
go
about
seemingly
whole
,
and
yet
be
contagious
to
all
those
that
come
near
them
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
most
experienced
physician
can
not
answer
this
question
directly
any
more
than
I
can
;
and
something
an
ordinary
observer
may
take
notice
of
,
which
may
pass
their
observation
.
<EOS>
the
opinion
of
physician
abroad
seem
to
be
that
it
may
lie
dormant
in
the
spirit
or
in
the
blood
-
vessel
a
very
considerable
time
.
<EOS>
why
else
do
they
exact
a
quarantine
of
those
who
come
into
their
harbour
and
port
from
suspect
place
?
<EOS>
forty
day
be
,
one
would
think
,
too
long
for
nature
to
struggle
with
such
an
enemy
as
this
,
and
not
conquer
it
or
yield
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
think
,
by
my
own
observation
,
that
they
can
be
infect
so
as
to
be
contagious
to
other
above
fifteen
or
sixteen
day
at
furth
;
and
on
that
score
it
be
,
that
when
a
house
be
shut
up
in
the
city
and
any
one
have
die
of
the
plague
,
but
nobody
appear
to
be
ill
in
the
family
for
sixteen
or
eighteen
day
after
,
they
be
not
so
strict
but
that
they
would
connive
at
their
go
privately
abroad
;
nor
would
people
be
much
afraid
of
them
afterward
,
but
rather
think
they
be
fortify
the
well
,
have
not
be
vulnerable
when
the
enemy
be
in
their
own
house
;
but
we
sometimes
find
it
have
lain
much
longer
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
foot
of
all
these
observation
I
must
say
that
though
Providence
seem
to
direct
my
conduct
to
be
otherwise
,
yet
it
be
my
opinion
,
and
I
must
leave
it
as
a
prescription
,
viz
.
,
that
the
good
physic
against
the
plague
be
to
run
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
people
encourage
themselves
by
say
God
be
able
to
keep
us
in
the
midst
of
danger
,
and
able
to
overtake
us
when
we
think
ourselves
out
of
danger
;
and
this
keep
thousand
in
the
town
whose
carcase
go
into
the
great
pit
by
cartload
,
and
who
,
if
they
have
flee
from
the
danger
,
have
,
I
believe
,
be
safe
from
the
disaster
;
at
least
'
tis
probable
they
have
be
safe
.
  
<EOS>
and
be
this
very
fundamental
only
duly
consider
by
the
people
on
any
future
occasion
of
this
or
the
like
nature
,
I
be
persuade
it
would
put
them
upon
quite
different
measure
for
manage
the
people
from
those
that
they
take
in
1665
,
or
than
any
that
have
be
take
abroad
that
I
have
hear
of
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
would
consider
of
separate
the
people
into
small
body
,
and
remove
them
in
time
farther
from
one
another
 
and
not
let
such
a
contagion
as
this
,
which
be
indeed
chiefly
dangerous
to
collect
body
of
people
,
find
a
million
of
people
in
a
body
together
,
as
be
very
near
the
case
before
,
and
would
certainly
be
the
case
if
it
should
ever
appear
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
plague
,
like
a
great
fire
,
if
a
few
house
only
be
contiguous
where
it
happen
,
can
only
burn
a
few
house
;
or
if
it
begin
in
a
single
,
or
,
as
we
call
it
,
a
lone
house
,
can
only
burn
that
lone
house
where
it
begin
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
begin
in
a
close
-
build
town
or
city
and
get
a
head
,
there
its
fury
increase
:
it
rage
over
the
whole
place
,
and
consume
all
it
can
reach
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
propose
many
scheme
on
the
foot
of
which
the
government
of
this
city
,
if
ever
they
should
be
under
the
apprehension
of
such
another
enemy
<EOS>
(
God
forbid
they
should
)
,
may
ease
themselves
of
the
great
part
of
the
dangerous
people
that
belong
to
them
;
I
mean
such
as
the
beg
,
starve
,
labour
poor
,
and
among
them
chiefly
those
who
,
in
case
of
a
siege
,
be
call
the
useless
mouth
;
who
be
then
prudently
and
to
their
own
advantage
dispose
of
,
and
the
wealthy
inhabitant
dispose
of
themselves
and
of
their
servant
and
child
,
the
city
and
its
adjacent
part
would
be
so
effectually
evacuate
that
there
would
not
be
above
a
tenth
part
of
its
people
leave
together
for
the
disease
to
take
hold
upon
.
<EOS>
but
suppose
them
to
be
a
fifth
part
,
and
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
be
leave
:
and
if
it
do
seize
upon
them
,
they
would
,
by
their
living
so
much
at
large
,
be
much
better
prepare
to
defend
themselves
against
the
infection
,
and
be
less
liable
to
the
effect
of
it
than
if
the
same
number
of
people
live
dose
together
in
one
small
city
such
as
Dublin
or
Amsterdam
or
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
hundred
,
yea
<EOS>
,
thousand
of
family
flee
away
at
this
last
plague
,
but
then
of
them
,
many
flee
too
late
,
and
not
only
die
in
their
flight
,
but
carry
the
distemper
with
them
into
the
country
where
they
go
and
infect
those
whom
they
go
among
for
safety
;
which
confound
the
thing
,
and
make
that
be
a
propagation
of
the
distemper
which
be
the
good
mean
to
prevent
it
;
and
this
too
be
an
evidence
of
it
,
and
bring
me
back
to
what
I
only
hint
at
before
,
but
must
speak
more
fully
to
here
,
namely
,
that
man
go
about
apparently
well
many
day
after
they
have
the
taint
of
the
disease
in
their
vital
,
and
after
their
spirit
be
so
seize
as
that
they
could
never
escape
it
,
and
that
all
the
while
they
do
so
they
be
dangerous
to
other
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
this
prove
that
so
it
be
;
for
such
people
infect
the
very
town
they
go
through
,
as
well
as
the
family
they
go
among
;
and
it
be
by
that
mean
that
almost
all
the
great
town
in
England
have
the
distemper
among
them
,
more
or
less
,
and
always
they
would
tell
you
such
a
Londoner
or
such
a
Londoner
bring
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
omit
that
when
I
speak
of
those
people
who
be
really
thus
dangerous
,
I
suppose
them
to
be
utterly
ignorant
of
their
own
condition
;
for
if
they
really
know
their
circumstance
to
be
such
as
indeed
they
be
,
they
must
have
be
a
kind
of
wilful
murtherer
if
they
would
have
go
abroad
among
healthy
people
 
and
it
would
have
verify
indeed
the
suggestion
which
I
mention
above
,
and
which
I
think
seem
untrue
:
viz
.
,
that
the
infected
people
be
utterly
careless
as
to
give
the
infection
to
other
,
and
rather
forward
to
do
it
than
not
;
and
I
believe
it
be
partly
from
this
very
thing
that
they
raise
that
suggestion
,
which
I
hope
be
not
really
true
in
fact
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
no
particular
case
be
sufficient
to
prove
a
general
,
but
I
could
name
several
people
within
the
knowledge
of
some
of
their
neighbour
and
family
yet
live
who
show
the
contrary
to
an
extreme
.
<EOS>
one
man
,
a
master
of
a
family
in
my
neighbourhood
,
have
have
the
distemper
,
he
think
he
have
it
give
him
by
a
poor
workman
whom
he
employ
,
and
whom
he
go
to
his
house
to
see
,
or
go
for
some
work
that
he
want
to
have
finish
;
and
he
have
some
apprehension
even
while
he
be
at
the
poor
workman
's
door
,
but
do
not
discover
it
fully
;
but
the
next
day
it
discover
itself
,
and
he
be
take
very
in
,
upon
which
he
immediately
cause
himself
to
be
carry
into
an
outbuilding
which
he
have
in
his
yard
,
and
where
there
be
a
chamber
over
a
workhouse
(
the
man
be
a
brazier
)
.
<EOS>
here
he
lie
,
and
here
he
die
,
and
would
be
tend
by
none
of
his
neighbour
,
but
by
a
nurse
from
abroad
;
and
would
not
suffer
his
wife
,
nor
child
,
nor
servant
to
come
up
into
the
room
,
lest
they
should
be
infect
 
but
send
them
his
blessing
and
prayer
for
them
by
the
nurse
,
who
speak
it
to
them
at
a
distance
,
and
all
this
for
fear
of
give
them
the
distemper
;
and
without
which
he
know
,
as
they
be
keep
up
,
they
could
not
have
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
I
must
observe
also
that
the
plague
,
as
I
suppose
all
distemper
do
,
operate
in
a
different
manner
on
differ
constitution
;
some
be
immediately
overwhelmed
with
it
,
and
it
come
to
violent
fever
,
vomiting
,
insufferable
headache
,
pain
in
the
back
,
and
so
up
to
raving
and
raging
with
those
pain
;
other
with
swelling
and
tumour
in
the
neck
or
groin
,
or
armpit
,
which
till
they
could
be
break
put
them
into
insufferable
agony
and
torment
;
while
other
,
as
I
have
observe
,
be
silently
infect
,
the
fever
prey
upon
their
spirit
insensibly
,
and
they
see
little
of
it
till
they
fall
into
swooning
,
and
fainting
,
and
death
without
pain
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
physician
enough
to
enter
into
the
particular
reason
and
manner
of
these
differ
effect
of
one
and
the
same
distemper
,
and
of
its
differ
operation
in
several
body
;
nor
be
it
my
business
here
to
record
the
observation
which
I
really
make
,
because
the
doctor
themselves
have
do
that
part
much
more
effectually
than
I
can
do
,
and
because
my
opinion
may
in
some
thing
differ
from
theirs
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
relate
what
I
know
,
or
have
hear
,
or
believe
of
the
particular
case
,
and
what
fall
within
the
compass
of
my
view
,
and
the
different
nature
of
the
infection
as
it
appear
in
the
particular
case
which
I
have
relate
;
but
this
may
be
add
too
:
that
though
the
former
sort
of
those
case
,
namely
,
those
openly
visit
,
be
the
bad
for
themselves
as
to
pain
 
<EOS>
I
mean
those
that
have
such
fever
,
vomiting
,
headache
,
pain
,
and
swelling
,
because
they
die
in
such
a
dreadful
manner
 
<EOS>
yet
the
latter
have
the
bad
state
of
the
disease
;
for
in
the
former
they
frequently
recover
,
especially
if
the
swelling
break
;
but
the
latter
be
inevitable
death
;
no
cure
,
no
help
,
could
be
possible
,
nothing
could
follow
but
death
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
bad
also
to
other
,
because
,
as
above
,
it
secretly
and
unperceive
by
other
or
by
themselves
,
communicate
death
to
those
they
converse
with
,
the
penetrating
poison
insinuate
itself
into
their
blood
in
a
manner
which
it
be
impossible
to
describe
,
or
indeed
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
this
infect
and
be
infect
without
so
much
as
its
be
know
to
either
person
be
evident
from
two
sort
of
case
which
frequently
happen
at
that
time
;
and
there
be
hardly
anybody
live
who
be
in
London
during
the
infection
but
must
have
know
several
of
the
case
of
both
sort
.
  
<EOS>
(

)
father
and
mother
have
go
about
as
if
they
have
be
well
,
and
have
believe
themselves
to
be
so
,
till
they
have
insensibly
infect
and
be
the
destruction
of
their
whole
family
,
which
they
would
have
be
far
from
do
if
they
have
the
least
apprehension
of
their
be
unsound
and
dangerous
themselves
.
<EOS>
a
family
,
whose
story
I
have
hear
,
be
thus
infect
by
the
father
;
and
the
distemper
begin
to
appear
upon
some
of
them
even
before
he
find
it
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
but
search
more
narrowly
,
it
appear
he
have
be
affect
some
time
;
and
as
soon
as
he
find
that
his
family
have
be
poison
by
himself
he
go
distracted
,
and
would
have
lay
violent
hand
upon
himself
,
but
be
keep
from
that
by
those
who
look
to
him
,
and
in
a
few
day
die
.
  
<EOS>
(
2
)
<EOS>
the
other
particular
be
,
that
many
people
have
be
well
to
the
good
of
their
own
judgement
,
or
by
the
good
observation
which
they
could
make
of
themselves
for
several
day
,
and
only
find
a
decay
of
appetite
,
or
a
light
sickness
upon
their
stomach
;
nay
,
some
whose
appetite
have
be
strong
,
and
even
crave
,
and
only
a
light
pain
in
their
head
,
have
send
for
physician
to
know
what
ail
them
,
and
have
be
find
,
to
their
great
surprise
,
at
the
brink
of
death
:
the
token
upon
them
,
or
the
plague
grow
up
to
an
incurable
height
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
sad
to
reflect
how
such
a
person
as
this
last
mention
above
have
be
a
walk
destroyer
perhaps
for
a
week
or
a
fortnight
before
that
;
how
he
have
ruin
those
that
he
would
have
hazard
his
life
to
save
,
and
have
be
breathe
death
upon
them
,
even
perhaps
in
his
tender
kissing
and
embracing
of
his
own
child
.
<EOS>
yet
thus
certainly
it
be
,
and
often
have
be
,
and
I
could
give
many
particular
case
where
it
have
be
so
.
<EOS>
if
then
the
blow
be
thus
insensibly
strike
 
if
the
arrow
fly
thus
unseen
,
and
can
not
be
discover
 
to
what
purpose
be
all
the
scheme
for
shut
up
or
remove
the
sick
people
?
<EOS>
those
scheme
can
not
take
place
but
upon
those
that
appear
to
be
sick
,
or
to
be
infect
;
whereas
there
be
among
them
at
the
same
time
thousand
of
people
who
seem
to
be
well
,
but
be
all
that
while
carry
death
with
them
into
all
company
which
they
come
into
.
  
<EOS>
this
frequently
puzzle
our
physician
,
and
especially
the
apothecary
and
surgeon
,
who
know
not
how
to
discover
the
sick
from
the
sound
;
they
all
allow
that
it
be
really
so
,
that
many
people
have
the
plague
in
their
very
blood
,
and
prey
upon
their
spirit
,
and
be
in
themselves
but
walk
putrefy
carcase
whose
breath
be
infectious
and
their
sweat
poison
,
and
yet
be
as
well
to
look
on
as
other
people
,
and
even
know
it
not
themselves
;
I
say
,
they
all
allow
that
it
be
really
true
in
fact
,
but
they
know
not
how
to
propose
a
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
My
friend
Dr
Heath
be
of
opinion
that
it
may
be
know
by
the
smell
of
their
breath
;
but
then
,
as
he
say
,
who
durst
smell
to
that
breath
for
his
information
?
<EOS>
since
,
to
know
it
,
he
must
draw
the
stench
of
the
plague
up
into
his
own
brain
,
in
order
to
distinguish
the
smell
!
<EOS>
I
have
hear
it
be
the
opinion
of
other
that
it
may
be
distinguish
by
the
party
's
breathing
upon
a
piece
of
glass
,
where
,
the
breath
condense
,
there
may
live
creature
be
see
by
a
microscope
,
of
strange
,
monstrous
,
and
frightful
shape
,
such
as
dragon
,
snake
,
serpent
,
and
devil
,
horrible
to
behold
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
very
much
question
the
truth
of
,
and
we
have
no
microscope
at
that
time
,
as
I
remember
,
to
make
the
experiment
with
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
opinion
also
of
another
learned
man
,
that
the
breath
of
such
a
person
would
poison
and
instantly
kill
a
bird
;
not
only
a
small
bird
,
but
even
a
cock
or
hen
,
and
that
,
if
it
do
not
immediately
kill
the
latter
,
it
would
cause
them
to
be
roupy
,
as
they
call
it
;
particularly
that
if
they
have
lay
any
egg
at
any
time
,
they
would
be
all
rotten
.
<EOS>
but
those
be
opinion
which
I
never
find
support
by
any
experiment
,
or
hear
of
other
that
have
see
it
;
so
I
leave
them
as
I
find
them
;
only
with
this
remark
,
namely
,
that
I
think
the
probability
be
very
strong
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
some
have
propose
that
such
person
should
breathe
hard
upon
warm
water
,
and
that
they
would
leave
an
unusual
scum
upon
it
,
or
upon
several
other
thing
,
especially
such
as
be
of
a
glutinous
substance
and
be
apt
to
receive
a
scum
and
support
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
from
the
whole
I
find
that
the
nature
of
this
contagion
be
such
that
it
be
impossible
to
discover
it
at
all
,
or
to
prevent
its
spreading
from
one
to
another
by
any
human
skill
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
indeed
one
difficulty
which
I
could
never
thoroughly
get
over
to
this
time
,
and
which
there
be
but
one
way
of
answer
that
I
know
of
,
and
it
be
this
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
the
first
person
that
die
of
the
plague
be
on
December
20
,
or
thereabout
,
1664
,
and
in
or
about
long
Acre
;
whence
the
first
person
have
the
infection
be
generally
say
to
be
from
a
parcel
of
silk
import
from
Holland
,
and
first
open
in
that
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
this
we
hear
no
more
of
any
person
die
of
the
plague
,
or
of
the
distemper
be
in
that
place
,
till
the
9th
of
February
,
which
be
about
seven
week
after
,
and
then
one
more
be
bury
out
of
the
same
house
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
hush
,
and
we
be
perfectly
easy
as
to
the
public
for
a
great
while
;
for
there
be
no
more
entered
in
the
weekly
bill
to
be
dead
of
the
plague
till
the
22nd
of
April
,
when
there
be
two
more
bury
,
not
out
of
the
same
house
,
but
out
of
the
same
street
;
and
,
as
near
as
I
can
remember
,
it
be
out
of
the
next
house
to
the
first
.
<EOS>
this
be
nine
week
asunder
,
and
after
this
we
have
no
more
till
a
fortnight
,
and
then
it
break
out
in
several
street
and
spread
every
way
.
<EOS>
now
the
question
seem
to
lie
thus
:
<EOS>
where
lie
the
seed
of
the
infection
all
this
while
?
<EOS>
how
come
it
to
stop
so
long
,
and
not
stop
any
longer
?
<EOS>
either
the
distemper
do
not
come
immediately
by
contagion
from
body
to
body
,
or
,
if
it
do
,
then
a
body
may
be
capable
to
continue
infect
without
the
disease
discover
itself
many
day
,
nay
,
week
together
;
even
not
a
quarantine
of
day
only
,
but
soixantine
;
not
only
forty
day
,
but
sixty
day
or
longer
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
there
be
,
as
I
observe
at
first
,
and
be
well
known
to
many
yet
live
,
a
very
cold
winter
and
a
long
frost
which
continue
three
month
;
and
this
,
the
doctor
say
,
may
check
the
infection
;
but
then
the
learn
must
allow
me
to
say
that
if
,
accord
to
their
notion
,
the
disease
be
(
as
I
may
say
)
only
freeze
up
,
it
would
like
a
frozen
river
have
return
to
its
usual
force
and
current
when
it
thaw
 
whereas
the
principal
recess
of
this
infection
,
which
be
from
February
to
April
,
be
after
the
frost
be
break
and
the
weather
mild
and
warm
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
another
way
of
solve
all
this
difficulty
,
which
I
think
my
own
remembrance
of
the
thing
will
supply
;
and
that
is
,
the
fact
be
not
grant
 
namely
<EOS>
,
that
there
die
none
in
those
long
interval
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
from
the
20th
of
December
to
the
9th
of
February
,
and
from
thence
to
the
22nd
of
April
.
<EOS>
the
weekly
bill
be
the
only
evidence
on
the
other
side
,
and
those
bill
be
not
of
credit
enough
,
at
least
with
me
,
to
support
an
hypothesis
or
determine
a
question
of
such
importance
as
this
;
for
it
be
our
receive
opinion
at
that
time
,
and
I
believe
upon
very
good
ground
,
that
the
fraud
lie
in
the
parish
officer
,
searcher
,
and
person
appoint
to
give
account
of
the
dead
,
and
what
disease
they
die
of
;
and
as
people
be
very
loth
at
first
to
have
the
neighbour
believe
their
house
be
infect
,
so
they
give
money
to
procure
,
or
otherwise
procure
,
the
dead
person
to
be
return
as
die
of
other
distemper
;
and
this
I
know
be
practise
afterwards
in
many
place
,
I
believe
I
may
say
in
all
place
where
the
distemper
come
,
as
will
be
see
by
the
vast
increase
of
the
number
place
in
the
weekly
bill
under
other
article
of
disease
during
the
time
of
the
infection
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
in
the
month
of
July
and
August
,
when
the
plague
be
come
on
to
its
high
pitch
,
it
be
very
ordinary
to
have
from
a
thousand
to
twelve
hundred
,
nay
,
to
almost
fifteen
hundred
a
week
of
other
distemper
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
number
of
those
distemper
be
really
increase
to
such
a
degree
,
but
the
great
number
of
family
and
house
where
really
the
infection
be
,
obtain
the
favour
to
have
their
dead
be
return
of
other
distemper
,
to
prevent
the
shutting
up
their
house
.

there
be
several
other
article
which
bear
a
proportion
to
these
,
and
which
,
it
be
easy
to
perceive
,
be
increase
on
the
same
account
,
as
aged
,
consumption
,
vomiting
,
imposthume
,
gripe
,
and
the
like
,
many
of
which
be
not
doubt
to
be
infect
people
;
but
as
it
be
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
family
not
to
be
know
to
be
infect
,
if
it
be
possible
to
avoid
it
,
so
they
take
all
the
measure
they
could
to
have
it
not
believe
,
and
if
any
die
in
their
house
,
to
get
them
return
to
the
examiner
,
and
by
the
searcher
,
as
have
die
of
other
distemper
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
I
say
,
will
account
for
the
long
interval
which
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
between
the
dying
of
the
first
person
that
be
return
in
the
bill
to
be
dead
of
the
plague
and
the
time
when
the
distemper
spread
openly
and
could
not
be
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
the
weekly
bill
themselves
at
that
time
evidently
discover
the
truth
;
for
,
while
there
be
no
mention
of
the
plague
,
and
no
increase
after
it
have
be
mention
,
yet
it
be
apparent
that
there
be
an
increase
of
those
distemper
which
border
nearest
upon
it
;
for
example
,
there
be
eight
,
twelve
,
seventeen
of
the
spot
fever
in
a
week
,
when
there
be
none
,
or
but
very
few
,
of
the
plague
;
whereas
before
,
one
,
three
,
or
four
be
the
ordinary
weekly
number
of
that
distemper
.
<EOS>
likewise
,
as
I
observe
before
,
the
burial
increase
weekly
in
that
particular
parish
and
<EOS>
the
parish
adjacent
more
than
in
any
other
parish
,
although
there
be
none
set
down
of
the
plague
;
all
which
tell
us
,
that
the
infection
be
hand
on
,
and
the
succession
of
the
distemper
really
preserve
,
though
it
seem
to
us
at
that
time
to
be
cease
,
and
to
come
again
in
a
manner
surprising
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
,
also
,
that
the
infection
may
remain
in
other
part
of
the
same
parcel
of
good
which
at
first
it
come
in
,
and
which
may
not
be
perhaps
open
,
or
at
least
not
fully
,
or
in
the
clothe
of
the
first
infected
person
;
for
I
can
not
think
that
anybody
could
be
seize
with
the
contagion
in
a
fatal
and
mortal
degree
for
nine
week
together
,
and
support
his
state
of
health
so
well
as
even
not
to
discover
it
to
themselves
;
yet
if
it
be
so
,
the
argument
be
the
strong
in
favour
of
what
I
be
say
:
<EOS>
namely
,
that
the
infection
be
retain
in
body
apparently
well
,
and
convey
from
them
to
those
they
converse
with
,
while
it
be
know
to
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
great
be
the
confusion
at
that
time
upon
this
very
account
,
and
when
people
begin
to
be
convince
that
the
infection
be
receive
in
this
surprising
manner
from
person
<EOS>
apparently
well
,
they
begin
to
be
exceed
shy
and
jealous
of
every
one
that
come
near
them
.
<EOS>
once
,
on
a
public
day
,
whether
a
Sabbath
-
day
or
not
I
do
not
remember
,
in
Aldgate
Church
,
in
a
pew
full
of
people
,
on
a
sudden
one
fancy
she
smell
an
ill
smell
.
<EOS>
immediately
she
fancy
the
plague
be
in
the
pew
,
whisper
her
notion
or
suspicion
to
the
next
,
then
rise
and
go
out
of
the
pew
.
<EOS>
It
immediately
take
with
the
next
,
and
so
to
them
all
;
and
every
one
of
them
,
and
of
the
two
or
three
adjoining
pew
,
get
up
and
go
out
of
the
church
,
nobody
know
what
it
be
offend
them
,
or
from
whom
.
  
<EOS>
this
immediately
fill
everybody
's
mouth
with
one
preparation
or
other
,
such
as
the
old
woman
direct
,
and
some
perhaps
as
physician
direct
,
in
order
to
prevent
infection
by
the
breath
of
other
;
insomuch
that
if
we
come
to
go
into
a
church
when
it
be
anything
full
of
people
,
there
would
be
such
a
mixture
of
smell
at
the
entrance
that
it
be
much
more
strong
,
though
perhaps
not
so
wholesome
,
than
if
you
be
go
into
an
apothecary
's
or
druggist
's
shop
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
whole
church
be
like
a
smell
-
bottle
;
in
one
corner
it
be
all
perfume
;
in
another
,
aromatic
,
balsamic
,
and
variety
of
drug
and
herb
;
in
another
,
salt
and
spirit
,
as
every
one
be
furnish
for
their
own
preservation
.
<EOS>
yet
I
observe
that
after
people
be
possess
,
as
I
have
say
,
with
the
belief
,
or
rather
assurance
,
of
the
infection
be
thus
carry
on
by
person
apparently
in
health
,
the
church
and
meeting
-
house
be
much
thin
of
people
than
at
other
time
before
that
they
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
for
this
be
to
be
say
of
the
people
of
London
,
that
during
the
whole
time
of
the
pestilence
the
church
or
meeting
be
never
wholly
shut
up
,
nor
do
the
people
decline
come
out
to
the
public
worship
of
God
,
except
only
in
some
parish
when
the
violence
of
the
distemper
be
more
particularly
in
that
parish
at
that
time
,
and
even
then
no
longer
than
it
continue
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
nothing
be
more
strange
than
to
see
with
what
courage
the
people
go
to
the
public
service
of
God
,
even
at
that
time
when
they
be
afraid
to
stir
out
of
their
own
house
upon
any
other
occasion
;
this
,
I
mean
,
before
the
time
of
desperation
,
which
I
have
mention
already
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
proof
of
the
exceed
populousness
of
the
city
at
the
time
of
the
infection
,
notwithstanding
the
great
number
that
be
go
into
the
country
at
the
first
alarm
,
and
that
flee
out
into
the
forest
and
wood
when
they
be
further
terrified
with
the
extraordinary
increase
of
it
.
<EOS>
for
when
we
come
to
see
the
crowd
and
throng
of
people
which
appear
on
the
Sabbath
-
day
at
the
church
,
and
especially
in
those
part
of
the
town
where
the
plague
be
abate
,
or
where
it
be
not
yet
come
to
its
height
,
it
be
amazing
.
<EOS>
but
of
this
I
shall
speak
again
presently
.
<EOS>
I
return
in
the
meantime
to
the
article
of
infect
one
another
at
first
,
before
people
come
to
right
notion
of
the
infection
,
and
of
infect
one
another
.
<EOS>
People
be
only
shy
of
those
that
be
really
sick
,
a
man
with
a
cap
upon
his
head
,
or
with
clothe
round
his
neck
,
which
be
the
case
of
those
that
have
swelling
there
.
<EOS>
such
be
indeed
frightful
;
but
when
we
see
a
gentleman
dress
,
with
his
band
on
and
his
glove
in
his
hand
,
his
hat
upon
his
head
,
and
his
hair
comb
,
of
such
we
bad
not
the
least
apprehension
,
and
people
converse
a
great
while
freely
,
especially
with
their
neighbour
and
such
as
they
know
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
physician
assure
us
that
the
danger
be
as
well
from
the
sound
(
that
is
,
the
seemingly
sound
)
as
the
sick
,
and
that
those
people
who
think
themselves
entirely
free
be
oftentime
the
most
fatal
,
and
that
it
come
to
be
generally
understand
that
people
be
sensible
of
it
,
and
of
the
reason
of
it
;
then
,
I
say
,
they
begin
to
be
jealous
of
everybody
,
and
a
vast
number
of
people
lock
themselves
up
,
so
as
not
to
come
abroad
into
any
company
at
all
,
nor
suffer
any
that
have
be
abroad
in
promiscuous
company
to
come
into
their
house
,
or
near
them
 
at
least
not
so
near
them
as
to
be
within
the
reach
of
their
breath
or
of
any
smell
from
them
;
and
when
they
be
oblige
to
converse
at
a
distance
with
stranger
,
they
would
always
have
preservative
in
their
mouth
and
about
their
clothe
to
repel
and
keep
off
the
infection
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledge
that
when
people
begin
to
use
these
caution
they
be
less
expose
to
danger
,
and
the
infection
do
not
break
into
such
house
so
furiously
as
it
do
into
other
before
;
and
thousand
of
family
be
preserve
(
speak
with
due
reserve
to
the
direction
of
Divine
Providence
)
by
that
mean
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
beat
anything
into
the
head
of
the
poor
.
<EOS>
They
go
on
with
the
usual
impetuosity
of
their
temper
,
full
of
outcry
and
lamentation
when
take
,
but
madly
careless
of
themselves
,
foolhardy
and
obstinate
,
while
they
be
well
.
<EOS>
where
they
could
get
employment
they
push
into
any
kind
of
business
,
the
most
dangerous
and
the
most
liable
to
infection
;
and
if
they
be
speak
to
,
their
answer
would
be
,
"
I
must
trust
to
God
for
that
;
if
I
be
take
,
then
I
be
provide
for
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
me
"
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
or
thus
,
"
why
,
what
must
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
starve
.
<EOS>
I
have
as
good
have
the
plague
as
perish
for
want
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
work
;
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
must
do
this
or
beg
.
<EOS>
"
suppose
it
be
bury
the
dead
,
or
attend
the
sick
,
or
watch
infected
house
,
which
be
all
terrible
hazard
;
but
their
tale
be
generally
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
necessity
be
a
very
justifiable
,
warrantable
plea
,
and
nothing
could
be
well
;
but
their
way
of
talk
be
much
the
same
where
the
necessity
be
not
the
same
.
<EOS>
this
adventurous
conduct
of
the
poor
be
that
which
bring
the
plague
among
them
in
a
most
furious
manner
;
and
this
,
join
to
the
distress
of
their
circumstance
when
take
,
be
the
reason
why
they
die
so
by
heap
;
for
I
can
not
say
I
could
observe
one
jot
of
well
husbandry
among
them
,
<EOS>
I
mean
the
labour
poor
,
while
they
be
all
well
and
get
money
than
there
be
before
,
<EOS>
but
as
lavish
,
as
extravagant
,
and
as
thoughtless
for
tomorrow
as
ever
;
so
that
when
they
come
to
be
take
sick
they
be
immediately
in
the
utmost
distress
,
as
well
for
want
as
for
sickness
,
as
well
for
lack
of
food
as
lack
of
health

this
misery
of
the
poor
<EOS>
I
have
many
occasion
to
be
an
eyewitness
of
,
and
sometimes
also
of
the
charitable
assistance
that
some
pious
people
daily
give
to
such
,
send
them
relief
and
supply
both
of
food
,
physic
,
and
other
help
,
as
they
find
they
want
;
and
indeed
it
be
a
debt
of
justice
due
to
the
temper
of
the
people
of
that
day
to
take
notice
here
,
that
not
only
great
sum
,
very
great
sum
of
money
be
charitably
send
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
for
the
assistance
and
support
of
the
poor
distemper
people
,
but
abundance
of
private
people
daily
distribute
large
sum
of
money
for
their
relief
,
and
send
people
about
to
inquire
into
the
condition
of
particular
distressed
and
visit
family
,
and
relieve
them
;
nay
,
some
pious
lady
be
so
transported
with
zeal
in
so
good
a
work
,
and
so
confident
in
the
protection
of
Providence
in
discharge
of
the
great
duty
of
charity
,
that
they
go
about
in
person
distribute
alm
to
the
poor
,
and
even
visit
poor
family
,
though
sick
and
infected
,
in
their
very
house
,
appoint
nurse
to
attend
those
that
want
attend
,
and
order
apothecary
and
surgeon
,
the
first
to
supply
them
with
drug
or
plaster
,
and
such
thing
as
they
want
;
and
the
last
to
lance
and
dress
the
swelling
and
tumour
,
where
such
be
want
;
give
their
blessing
to
the
poor
in
substantial
relief
to
them
,
as
well
as
hearty
prayer
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
undertake
to
say
,
as
some
do
,
that
none
of
those
charitable
people
be
suffer
to
fall
under
the
calamity
itself
;
but
this
I
may
say
,
that
I
never
know
any
one
of
them
that
miscarry
,
which
I
mention
for
the
encouragement
of
other
in
case
of
the
like
distress
;
and
doubtless
,
if
they
that
give
to
the
poor
lend
to
the
Lord
,
and
He
will
repay
them
,
those
that
hazard
their
life
to
give
to
the
poor
,
and
to
comfort
and
assist
the
poor
in
such
a
misery
as
this
,
may
hope
to
be
protect
in
the
work
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
this
charity
so
extraordinary
eminent
only
in
a
few
,
but
<EOS>
(
for
I
can
not
lightly
quit
this
point
)
<EOS>
the
charity
of
the
rich
,
as
well
in
the
city
and
suburb
as
from
the
country
,
be
so
great
that
,
in
a
word
,
a
prodigious
number
of
people
who
must
otherwise
inevitably
have
perish
for
want
as
well
as
sickness
be
support
and
subsist
by
it
;
and
though
I
could
never
,
nor
I
believe
any
one
else
,
come
to
a
full
knowledge
of
what
be
so
contribute
,
yet
I
do
believe
that
,
as
I
hear
one
say
that
be
a
critical
observer
of
that
part
,
there
be
not
only
many
thousand
pound
contribute
,
but
<EOS>
many
hundred
thousand
pound
,
to
the
relief
of
the
poor
of
this
distressed
,
afflicted
city
<EOS>
;
nay
,
one
man
affirm
to
me
that
he
could
reckon
up
above
one
hundred
thousand
pound
a
week
,
which
be
distribute
by
the
churchwarden
at
the
several
parish
vestry
by
the
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
in
the
several
ward
and
precinct
,
and
by
the
particular
direction
of
the
court
and
of
the
justice
respectively
in
the
part
where
they
reside
,
over
and
above
the
private
charity
distribute
by
pious
band
in
the
manner
I
speak
of
;
and
this
continue
for
many
week
together
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
this
be
a
very
great
sum
;
but
if
it
be
true
that
there
be
distribute
in
the
parish
of
Cripplegate
only
,
17,800
in
one
week
to
the
relief
of
the
poor
,
as
I
hear
report
,
and
<EOS>
which
I
really
believe
be
true
,
the
other
may
not
be
improbable
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
doubtless
to
be
reckon
among
the
many
signal
good
providence
which
attend
this
great
city
,
and
of
which
there
be
many
other
worth
recording
,
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
this
be
a
very
remarkable
one
,
that
it
please
God
thus
to
move
the
heart
of
the
people
in
all
part
of
the
kingdom
so
cheerfully
to
contribute
to
the
relief
and
support
of
the
poor
at
London
,
the
good
consequence
of
which
be
feel
many
way
,
and
particularly
in
preserve
the
life
and
recover
the
health
of
so
many
thousand
,
and
keep
so
many
thousand
of
family
from
perish
and
starve
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
talk
of
the
merciful
disposition
of
Providence
in
this
time
of
calamity
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
but
mention
again
,
though
I
have
speak
several
time
of
it
already
on
other
account
,
I
mean
that
of
the
progression
of
the
distemper
;
how
it
begin
at
one
end
of
the
town
,
and
proceed
gradually
and
slowly
from
one
part
to
another
,
and
like
a
dark
cloud
that
pass
over
our
head
,
which
,
as
it
thicken
and
overcast
the
air
at
one
end
,
dear
up
at
the
other
end
;
so
,
while
the
plague
go
on
rage
from
west
to
east
,
as
it
go
forwards
east
,
it
abate
in
the
west
,
by
which
mean
those
part
of
the
town
which
be
not
seize
,
or
who
be
leave
,
and
where
it
have
spend
its
fury
,
<EOS>
be
(
as
it
be
)
spare
to
help
and
assist
the
other
;
whereas
,
have
the
distemper
spread
itself
over
the
whole
city
and
suburb
,
at
once
,
rage
in
all
place
alike
,
as
it
have
do
since
in
some
place
abroad
,
the
whole
body
of
the
people
must
have
be
overwhelm
,
and
there
would
have
die
twenty
thousand
a
day
,
as
they
say
there
do
at
Naples
;
nor
would
the
people
have
be
able
to
have
help
or
assist
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
for
it
must
be
observe
that
where
the
plague
be
in
its
full
force
,
there
indeed
the
people
be
very
miserable
,
and
the
consternation
be
inexpressible
.
<EOS>
but
a
little
before
it
reach
even
to
that
place
,
or
presently
after
it
be
go
,
they
be
quite
another
sort
of
people
;
and
I
can
not
but
acknowledge
that
there
be
too
much
of
that
common
temper
of
mankind
to
be
find
among
us
all
at
that
time
,
namely
,
to
forget
the
deliverance
when
the
danger
be
past
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
come
to
speak
of
that
part
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
forget
here
to
take
some
notice
of
the
state
of
trade
during
the
time
of
this
common
calamity
,
and
this
with
respect
to
foreign
trade
,
as
also
to
our
home
trade
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
foreign
trade
,
there
need
little
to
be
say
.
<EOS>
the
trading
nation
of
Europe
be
all
afraid
of
us
;
no
port
of
France
,
or
Holland
,
or
Spain
,
or
Italy
would
admit
our
ship
or
correspond
with
us
;
indeed
we
stand
on
ill
term
with
the
Dutch
,
and
be
in
a
furious
war
with
them
,
but
though
in
a
bad
condition
to
fight
abroad
,
who
have
such
dreadful
enemy
to
struggle
with
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
Our
merchant
be
accordingly
at
a
full
stop
;
their
ship
could
go
nowhere
 
that
be
to
say
,
to
no
place
abroad
;
their
manufacture
and
merchandise
 
that
be
to
say
,
of
our
growth
 
would
not
be
touch
abroad
.
<EOS>
They
be
as
much
afraid
of
our
good
as
they
be
of
our
people
;
and
indeed
they
have
reason
:
for
our
woollen
manufacture
be
as
retentive
of
infection
as
human
body
,
and
if
pack
up
by
person
infect
,
would
receive
the
infection
and
be
as
dangerous
to
touch
as
a
man
<EOS>
would
be
that
be
infect
;
and
therefore
,
when
any
english
vessel
arrive
in
foreign
country
,
if
they
do
take
the
good
on
shore
,
they
always
cause
the
bale
to
be
open
and
air
in
place
appoint
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
from
London
they
would
not
suffer
them
to
come
into
port
,
much
less
to
unlade
their
good
,
upon
any
term
whatever
,
and
this
strictness
be
especially
use
with
them
in
Spain
and
Italy
.
<EOS>
in
Turkey
and
the
island
of
the
Arches
indeed
,
as
they
be
call
,
as
well
those
belong
to
the
Turks
as
to
the
Venetians
,
they
be
not
so
very
rigid
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
there
be
no
obstruction
at
all
;
and
four
ship
which
be
then
in
the
river
loading
for
Italy
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
for
Leghorn
and
Naples
 
be
deny
product
,
as
they
call
it
,
go
on
to
Turkey
,
and
be
freely
admit
to
unlade
their
cargo
without
any
difficulty
;
only
that
when
they
arrive
there
,
some
of
their
cargo
be
not
fit
for
sale
in
that
country
;
and
other
part
of
it
be
consign
to
merchant
at
Leghorn
,
the
captain
of
the
ship
have
no
right
nor
any
order
to
dispose
of
the
good
;
so
that
great
inconvenience
follow
to
the
merchant
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
nothing
but
what
the
necessity
of
affair
require
,
and
the
merchant
at
Leghorn
and
Naples
have
notice
give
them
,
send
again
from
thence
to
take
care
of
the
effect
which
be
particularly
consign
to
those
port
,
and
to
bring
back
in
other
ship
such
as
be
improper
for
the
market
at
Smyrna
and
Scanderoon
.
  
<EOS>
the
inconvenience
in
Spain
and
Portugal
be
still
great
,
for
they
would
by
no
mean
suffer
our
ship
,
especially
those
from
London
,
to
come
into
any
of
their
port
,
much
less
to
unlade
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
report
that
one
of
our
ship
have
by
stealth
deliver
her
cargo
,
among
which
be
some
bale
of
english
cloth
,
cotton
,
kersey
,
and
such
-
like
good
,
the
Spaniards
cause
all
the
good
to
be
burn
,
and
punish
the
man
with
death
who
be
concern
in
carry
them
on
shore
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
believe
,
be
in
part
true
,
though
I
do
not
affirm
it
;
but
it
be
not
at
all
unlikely
,
see
the
danger
be
really
very
great
,
the
infection
be
so
violent
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
likewise
that
the
plague
be
carry
into
those
country
by
some
of
our
ship
,
and
particularly
to
the
port
of
Faro
in
the
kingdom
of
Algarve
,
belong
to
the
King
of
Portugal
,
and
that
several
person
die
of
it
there
;
but
it
be
not
confirm
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
though
the
Spaniards
and
Portuguese
be
so
shy
of
us
,
it
be
most
certain
that
the
plague
(
as
have
be
say
)
keep
at
first
much
at
that
end
of
the
town
next
Westminster
,
<EOS>
the
merchandise
part
of
the
town
(
such
as
the
city
and
the
water
-
side
)
be
perfectly
sound
till
at
least
the
beginning
of
July
,
and
the
ship
in
the
river
till
the
beginning
of
August
;
for
to
the
1st
of
July
there
have
die
but
seven
within
the
whole
city
,
and
but
sixty
within
the
liberty
,
but
one
in
all
the
parish
of
Stepney
,
Aldgate
,
and
Whitechappel
,
<EOS>
and
but
two
in
the
eight
parish
of
Southwark
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
same
thing
abroad
,
for
the
bad
news
be
go
over
the
whole
world
that
the
city
of
London
be
infect
with
the
plague
,
and
there
be
no
inquire
there
how
the
infection
proceed
,
or
at
which
part
of
the
town
it
be
begin
or
be
reach
to
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
after
it
begin
to
spread
it
increase
so
fast
,
and
the
bill
grow
so
high
all
on
a
sudden
,
that
it
be
to
no
purpose
to
lessen
the
report
of
it
,
or
endeavour
to
make
the
people
abroad
think
it
better
than
it
be
;
the
account
which
the
weekly
bill
give
in
be
sufficient
;
and
that
there
die
two
thousand
to
three
or
-
four
thousand
a
week
be
sufficient
to
alarm
the
whole
trading
part
of
the
world
;
and
the
follow
time
,
be
so
dreadful
also
in
the
very
city
itself
,
put
the
whole
world
,
I
say
,
upon
their
guard
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
,
also
,
that
the
report
of
these
thing
lose
nothing
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
the
plague
be
itself
very
terrible
,
and
the
distress
of
the
people
very
great
,
as
you
may
observe
of
what
I
have
say
.
<EOS>
but
the
rumour
be
infinitely
great
,
and
it
must
not
be
wonder
that
our
friend
abroad
(
as
my
brother
's
correspondent
in
particular
be
tell
there
,
namely
,
in
Portugal
and
Italy
,
where
he
chiefly
trade
)
[
say
]
<EOS>
that
in
London
there
die
twenty
thousand
in
a
week
;
that
the
dead
body
lie
unburie
by
heap
;
that
the
living
be
not
sufficient
to
bury
the
dead
or
the
sound
to
look
after
the
sick
;
that
all
the
kingdom
be
infect
likewise
,
so
that
it
be
an
universal
malady
such
as
be
never
hear
of
in
those
part
of
the
world
;
and
they
could
hardly
believe
us
when
we
give
them
an
account
how
thing
really
be
,
and
how
there
be
not
above
one
-
tenth
part
of
the
people
dead
;
that
there
be
500,000
,
leave
that
live
all
the
time
in
the
town
;
that
now
the
people
begin
to
walk
the
street
again
,
and
those
who
be
flee
to
return
,
there
be
no
miss
of
the
usual
throng
of
people
in
the
street
,
except
as
every
family
may
miss
their
relation
and
neighbour
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
I
say
they
could
not
believe
these
thing
;
and
if
inquiry
be
now
to
be
make
in
Naples
,
or
in
other
city
on
the
coast
of
Italy
,
they
would
tell
you
that
there
be
a
dreadful
infection
in
London
so
many
year
ago
,
in
which
,
as
above
,
there
die
twenty
thousand
in
a
week
,
&
c.
,
just
as
we
have
have
it
report
in
London
that
there
be
a
plague
in
the
city
of
Naples
in
the
year
1656
,
in
which
there
die
20,000
people
in
a
day
,
of
which
I
have
have
very
good
satisfaction
that
it
be
utterly
false
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
extravagant
report
be
very
prejudicial
to
our
trade
,
as
well
as
unjust
and
injurious
in
themselves
,
for
it
be
a
long
time
after
the
plague
be
quite
over
before
our
trade
could
recover
itself
in
those
part
of
the
world
;
and
the
Flemings
and
Dutch
(
but
especially
the
last
)
make
very
great
advantage
of
it
,
have
all
the
market
to
themselves
,
and
even
buy
our
manufacture
in
several
part
of
England
where
the
plague
be
not
,
and
carry
them
to
Holland
and
Flanders
,
and
from
thence
transport
them
to
Spain
and
to
Italy
as
if
they
have
be
of
their
own
making
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
be
detect
sometimes
and
punish
:
that
be
to
say
,
their
good
confiscate
and
ship
also
;
for
if
it
be
true
that
our
manufacture
as
well
as
our
people
be
infect
,
and
that
it
be
dangerous
to
touch
or
to
open
and
receive
the
smell
of
them
,
then
those
people
run
the
hazard
by
that
clandestine
trade
not
only
of
carry
the
contagion
into
their
own
country
,
but
also
of
infect
the
nation
to
whom
they
trade
with
those
good
;
which
,
consider
how
many
life
may
be
lose
in
consequence
of
such
an
action
,
must
be
a
trade
that
no
man
of
conscience
could
suffer
themselves
to
be
concern
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
take
upon
me
to
say
that
any
harm
be
do
,
I
mean
of
that
kind
,
by
those
people
.
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
I
need
not
make
any
such
proviso
in
the
case
of
our
own
country
;
for
either
by
our
people
of
London
,
or
by
the
commerce
which
make
their
conversing
with
all
sort
of
people
in
every
country
and
of
every
considerable
town
necessary
,
I
say
,
by
this
mean
the
plague
be
first
or
last
spread
all
over
the
kingdom
,
as
well
in
London
as
in
all
the
city
and
great
town
,
especially
in
the
trading
manufacturing
town
and
seaport
;
so
that
,
first
or
last
,
all
the
considerable
place
in
England
be
visit
more
or
less
,
and
the
kingdom
of
Ireland
in
some
place
,
but
not
so
universally
.
<EOS>
how
it
fare
with
the
people
in
Scotland
<EOS>
I
have
no
opportunity
to
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
observe
that
while
the
plague
continue
so
violent
in
London
,
the
outport
,
as
they
be
call
,
enjoy
a
very
great
trade
,
especially
to
the
adjacent
country
and
to
our
own
plantation
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
the
town
of
Colchester
,
Yarmouth
,
and
Hun
,
on
that
side
of
England
,
export
to
Holland
and
Hamburg
the
manufacture
of
the
adjacent
country
for
several
month
after
the
trade
with
London
be
,
as
it
be
,
entirely
shut
up
;
likewise
the
city
of
Bristol
and
Exeter
,
with
the
port
of
Plymouth
,
have
the
like
advantage
to
Spain
,
to
the
Canaries
,
to
Guinea
,
and
to
the
West
Indies
,
and
particularly
to
Ireland
;
but
as
the
plague
spread
itself
every
way
after
it
have
be
in
London
to
such
a
degree
as
it
be
in
August
and
September
,
so
all
or
most
of
those
city
and
town
be
infect
first
or
last
;
and
then
trade
be
,
as
it
be
,
under
a
general
embargo
or
at
a
full
stop
 
as
I
shall
observe
further
when
I
speak
of
our
home
trade
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
,
however
,
must
be
observe
:
that
as
to
ship
come
in
from
abroad
(
as
many
,
you
may
be
sure
,
do
)
<EOS>
some
who
be
out
in
all
part
of
the
world
a
considerable
while
before
,
and
some
who
when
they
go
out
know
nothing
of
an
infection
,
or
at
least
of
one
so
terrible
 
<EOS>
these
come
up
the
river
boldly
,
and
deliver
their
cargo
as
they
be
oblige
to
do
,
except
just
in
the
two
month
of
August
and
September
,
when
the
weight
of
the
infection
lie
,
as
I
may
say
,
all
below
Bridge
,
nobody
durst
appear
in
business
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
but
as
this
continue
but
for
a
few
week
,
the
homeward
-
bind
ship
,
especially
such
whose
cargo
be
not
liable
to
spoil
,
come
to
an
anchor
for
a
time
short
of
the
Pool
,
*
<EOS>
or
fresh
-
water
part
of
the
river
,
even
as
low
as
the
river
Medway
,
where
several
of
them
run
in
;
and
other
lie
at
the
Nore
,
and
in
the
Hope
below
Gravesend
.
<EOS>
so
that
by
the
latter
end
of
October
there
be
a
very
great
fleet
of
homeward
-
bind
ship
to
come
up
,
such
as
the
like
have
not
be
know
for
many
year
.
   
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
that
part
of
the
river
where
the
ship
lie
up
when
they
come
home
be
call
the
Pool
,
and
take
in
all
the
river
on
both
side
of
the
water
,
from
the
Tower
to
Cuckold
's
Point
and
Limehouse
.
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
two
particular
trade
be
carry
on
by
water
-
carriage
all
the
while
of
the
infection
,
and
that
with
little
or
no
interruption
,
very
much
to
the
advantage
and
comfort
of
the
poor
distressed
people
of
the
city
:
and
those
be
the
coast
trade
for
corn
and
the
Newcastle
trade
for
coal
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
be
particularly
carry
on
by
small
vessel
from
the
port
of
Hull
and
other
place
on
the
Humber
,
by
which
great
quantity
of
corn
be
bring
in
from
Yorkshire
and
Lincolnshire
.
<EOS>
the
other
part
of
this
corn
-
trade
be
from
Lynn
,
in
Norfolk
,
from
Wells
and
Burnham
,
and
from
Yarmouth
,
all
in
the
same
county
;
and
the
third
branch
be
from
the
river
Medway
,
and
from
Milton
,
Feversham
,
Margate
,
and
Sandwich
,
and
all
the
other
little
place
and
port
round
the
coast
of
Kent
and
Essex
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
very
good
trade
from
the
coast
of
Suffolk
with
corn
,
butter
,
and
cheese
;
these
vessel
keep
a
constant
course
of
trade
,
and
without
interruption
come
up
to
that
market
know
still
by
the
name
of
Bear
Key
,
where
they
supply
the
city
plentifully
with
corn
when
land
-
carriage
begin
to
fail
,
and
when
the
people
begin
to
be
sick
of
come
from
many
place
in
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
this
also
be
much
of
it
owe
to
the
prudence
and
conduct
of
the
Lord
Mayor
,
who
take
such
care
to
keep
the
master
and
seaman
from
danger
when
they
come
up
,
cause
their
corn
to
be
buy
off
at
any
time
they
want
a
market
(
which
,
however
,
be
very
seldom
)
,
and
cause
the
corn
-
factor
immediately
to
unlade
and
deliver
the
vessel
loaden
with
corn
,
that
they
have
very
little
occasion
to
come
out
of
their
ship
or
vessel
,
the
money
be
always
carry
on
board
to
them
and
put
into
a
pail
of
vinegar
before
it
be
carry
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
trade
be
that
of
coal
from
Newcastle
-
upon
-
Tyne
,
without
which
the
city
would
have
be
greatly
distressed
;
for
not
in
the
street
only
,
but
in
private
house
and
family
,
great
quantity
of
coal
be
then
burn
,
even
all
the
summer
long
and
when
the
weather
be
hot
,
which
be
do
by
the
advice
of
the
physician
.
<EOS>
some
indeed
oppose
it
,
and
insist
that
to
keep
the
house
and
room
hot
be
a
means
to
propagate
the
temper
,
which
be
a
fermentation
and
heat
already
in
the
blood
;
that
it
be
know
to
spread
and
increase
in
hot
weather
and
abate
in
cold
;
and
therefore
they
allege
that
all
contagious
distemper
be
the
bad
for
heat
,
because
the
contagion
be
nourish
and
gain
strength
in
hot
weather
,
and
be
,
as
it
be
,
propagate
in
heat
.
  
<EOS>
other
say
they
grant
that
heat
in
the
climate
may
propagate
infection
 
as
sultry
,
hot
weather
fill
the
air
with
vermin
and
nourishe
innumerable
number
and
kind
of
venomous
creature
which
breed
in
our
food
,
in
the
plant
,
and
even
in
our
body
,
by
the
very
stench
of
which
infection
may
be
propagate
;
also
that
heat
in
the
air
,
or
heat
of
weather
,
as
we
ordinarily
call
it
,
make
body
relax
and
faint
,
exhaust
the
spirit
,
open
the
pore
,
and
make
us
more
apt
to
receive
infection
,
or
any
evil
influence
,
be
it
from
noxious
pestilential
vapour
or
any
other
thing
in
the
air
;
but
that
the
heat
of
fire
,
and
especially
of
coal
fire
keep
in
our
house
,
or
near
us
,
have
a
quite
different
operation
;
the
heat
be
not
of
the
same
kind
,
but
quick
and
fierce
,
tend
not
to
nourish
but
to
consume
and
dissipate
all
those
noxious
fume
which
the
other
kind
of
heat
rather
exhale
and
stagnate
than
separate
and
burn
up
.
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
allege
that
the
sulphurous
and
nitrous
particle
that
be
often
find
to
be
in
the
coal
,
with
that
bituminous
substance
which
burn
,
be
all
assist
to
clear
and
purge
the
air
,
and
render
it
wholesome
and
safe
to
breathe
in
after
the
noxious
particle
,
as
above
,
be
disperse
and
burn
up
.
  
<EOS>
the
latter
opinion
prevail
at
that
time
,
and
,
as
I
must
confess
,
I
think
with
good
reason
;
and
the
experience
of
the
citizen
confirm
it
,
many
house
which
have
constant
fire
keep
in
the
room
have
never
be
infect
at
all
;
and
I
must
join
my
experience
to
it
,
for
I
find
the
keep
good
fire
keep
our
room
sweet
and
wholesome
,
and
I
do
verily
believe
make
<EOS>
our
whole
family
so
,
more
than
would
otherwise
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
return
to
the
coal
as
a
trade
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
no
little
difficulty
that
this
trade
be
keep
open
,
and
particularly
because
,
as
we
be
in
an
open
war
with
I
the
Dutch
at
that
time
,
the
dutch
caper
at
first
take
a
great
many
of
our
collier
-
ship
,
which
make
the
rest
cautious
,
and
make
them
to
stay
to
come
in
fleet
together
.
<EOS>
but
after
some
time
the
caper
be
either
afraid
to
take
them
,
or
their
master
,
the
States
,
be
afraid
they
should
,
and
forbid
them
,
lest
the
plague
should
be
among
them
,
which
make
them
fare
the
well
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
security
of
those
northern
trader
,
the
coal
-
ship
be
order
by
my
Lord
Mayor
not
to
come
up
into
the
Pool
above
a
certain
number
at
a
time
,
and
order
lighter
and
other
vessel
such
as
the
woodmonger
(
that
is
,
the
wharf
-
keeper
or
coal
-
seller
)
furnish
,
to
go
down
and
take
out
the
coal
as
low
as
Deptford
and
Greenwich
,
and
some
farther
down
.
  
<EOS>
other
deliver
great
quantity
of
coal
in
particular
place
where
the
ship
could
come
to
the
shore
,
as
at
Greenwich
,
Blackwall
,
and
other
place
,
in
vast
heap
,
as
if
to
be
keep
for
sale
;
but
be
then
fetch
away
after
the
ship
which
bring
them
be
go
,
so
that
the
seaman
have
no
communication
with
the
river
-
man
,
nor
so
much
as
come
near
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
yet
all
this
caution
could
not
effectually
prevent
the
distemper
get
among
the
colliery
:
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
among
the
ship
,
by
which
a
great
many
seaman
die
of
it
;
and
that
which
be
still
bad
be
,
that
they
carry
it
down
to
Ipswich
and
Yarmouth
,
to
Newcastle
-
upon
-
Tyne
,
and
other
place
on
the
coast
 
<EOS>
where
,
especially
at
Newcastle
and
at
Sunderland
,
it
carry
off
a
great
number
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
the
making
so
many
fire
,
as
above
,
do
indeed
consume
an
unusual
quantity
of
coal
;
and
that
upon
one
or
two
stop
of
the
ship
come
up
,
whether
by
contrary
weather
or
by
the
interruption
of
enemy
I
do
not
remember
,
but
the
price
of
coal
be
exceed
dear
,
even
as
high
as
4
a
chalder
;
but
it
soon
abate
when
the
ship
come
in
,
and
as
afterwards
they
have
a
free
passage
,
the
price
be
very
reasonable
all
the
rest
of
that
year
.
  
<EOS>
the
public
fire
which
be
make
on
these
occasion
,
as
I
have
calculate
it
,
must
necessarily
have
cost
the
city
about
200
chalder
of
coal
a
week
,
if
they
have
continue
,
which
be
indeed
a
very
great
quantity
;
but
as
it
be
think
necessary
,
nothing
be
spare
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
some
of
the
physician
cry
them
down
,
they
be
not
keep
alight
above
four
or
five
day
.
<EOS>
the
fire
be
order
thus
:
    
one
at
the
Custom
House
,
one
at
Billingsgate
,
one
at
Queenhith
,
and
one
at
the
Three
Cranes
;
one
in
Blackfriars
,
and
one
at
the
gate
of
Bridewell
;
one
at
the
corner
of
Leadenhal
Street
and
Gracechurch
;
one
at
the
north
and
one
at
the
south
gate
of
the
Royal
Exchange
;
one
at
Guild
Hall
,
and
one
at
Blackwell
Hall
gate
;
one
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
door
in
St
Helen
's
,
one
at
the
west
entrance
into
St
Paul
's
,
and
one
at
the
entrance
into
Bow
Church
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
whether
there
be
any
at
the
city
gate
,
but
one
at
the
Bridge
-
foot
there
be
,
just
by
St
Magnus
Church
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
some
have
quarrel
since
that
at
the
experiment
,
and
say
that
there
die
the
more
people
because
of
those
fire
;
but
I
be
persuade
those
that
say
so
offer
no
evidence
to
prove
it
,
neither
can
I
believe
it
on
any
account
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
It
remain
to
give
some
account
of
the
state
of
trade
at
home
in
England
during
this
dreadful
time
,
and
particularly
as
it
relate
to
the
manufacture
and
the
trade
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
breaking
out
of
the
infection
there
be
,
as
it
be
easy
to
suppose
,
a
very
great
fright
among
the
people
,
and
consequently
a
general
stop
of
trade
,
except
in
provision
and
necessary
of
life
;
and
even
in
those
thing
,
as
there
be
a
vast
number
of
people
flee
and
a
very
great
number
always
sick
,
besides
the
number
which
die
,
so
there
could
not
be
above
two
-
third
,
if
above
one
-
half
,
of
the
consumption
of
provision
in
the
city
as
use
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
please
God
to
send
a
very
plentiful
year
of
corn
and
fruit
,
but
not
of
hay
or
grass
 
by
which
mean
bread
be
cheap
,
by
reason
of
the
plenty
of
corn
.
<EOS>
flesh
be
cheap
,
by
reason
of
the
scarcity
of
grass
;
but
butter
and
cheese
be
dear
for
the
same
reason
,
and
hay
in
the
market
just
beyond
Whitechappel
Bars
be
sell
at
4
pound
per
load
.
<EOS>
but
that
affect
not
the
poor
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
most
excessive
plenty
of
all
sort
of
fruit
,
such
as
apple
,
pear
,
plum
,
cherry
,
grape
,
and
they
be
the
cheap
because
of
the
want
of
people
;
but
this
make
the
poor
eat
them
to
excess
,
and
this
bring
them
into
flux
,
gripe
of
the
gut
,
surfeit
,
and
the
like
,
which
often
precipitate
them
into
the
plague
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
come
to
matter
of
trade
.

first
,
foreign
exportation
be
stop
or
at
least
very
much
interrupted
and
render
difficult
,
a
general
stop
of
all
those
manufacture
follow
of
course
which
be
usually
bring
for
exportation
;
and
though
sometimes
merchant
abroad
be
importunate
for
good
,
yet
little
be
send
,
the
passage
be
so
generally
stop
that
the
english
ship
would
not
be
admit
,
as
be
say
already
,
into
their
port
.
  
<EOS>
this
put
a
stop
to
the
manufacture
that
be
for
exportation
in
most
part
of
England
,
except
in
some
out
-
port
;
and
even
that
be
soon
stop
,
for
they
all
have
the
plague
in
their
turn
.
<EOS>
but
though
this
be
feel
all
over
England
,
yet
,
what
be
still
bad
,
all
intercourse
of
trade
for
home
consumption
of
manufacture
,
especially
those
which
usually
circulate
through
the
Londoner
's
hand
,
be
stop
at
once
,
the
trade
of
the
city
being
stop
.
  
<EOS>
all
kind
of
handicraft
in
the
city
,
&
c.
,
tradesman
and
mechanic
,
be
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
out
of
employ
;
and
this
occasion
the
putting
-
off
and
dismiss
an
innumerable
number
of
journeyman
and
workman
of
all
sort
,
see
nothing
be
do
relate
to
such
trade
but
what
may
be
say
to
be
absolutely
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
this
cause
the
multitude
of
single
people
in
London
to
be
unprovided
for
,
as
also
family
whose
living
depend
upon
the
labour
of
the
head
of
those
family
;
I
say
,
this
reduce
them
to
extreme
misery
;
and
I
must
confess
it
be
for
the
honour
of
the
city
of
London
,
and
will
be
for
many
age
,
as
long
as
this
be
to
be
speak
of
,
that
they
be
able
to
supply
with
charitable
provision
the
want
of
so
many
thousand
of
those
as
afterwards
fall
sick
and
be
distressed
:
so
that
it
may
be
safely
aver
that
nobody
perish
for
want
,
at
least
that
the
magistrate
have
any
notice
give
them
of
.
  
<EOS>
this
stagnation
of
our
manufacturing
trade
in
the
country
would
have
put
the
people
there
to
much
great
difficulty
,
but
that
the
master
-
workman
,
clothier
and
other
,
to
the
uttermost
of
their
stock
and
strength
,
keep
on
make
their
good
to
keep
the
poor
at
work
,
believe
that
soon
as
the
sickness
should
abate
they
would
have
a
quick
demand
in
proportion
to
the
decay
of
their
trade
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
but
as
none
but
those
master
that
be
rich
could
do
thus
,
and
that
many
be
poor
and
not
able
,
the
manufacturing
trade
in
England
suffer
greatly
,
and
the
poor
be
pinch
all
over
England
by
the
calamity
of
the
city
of
London
only
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
the
next
year
make
them
full
amend
by
another
terrible
calamity
upon
the
city
;
so
that
the
city
by
one
calamity
impoverish
and
weaken
the
country
,
and
by
another
calamity
,
even
terrible
too
of
its
kind
,
enrich
the
country
and
make
them
again
amend
;
for
an
infinite
quantity
of
household
stuff
,
wear
apparel
,
and
other
thing
,
besides
whole
warehouse
fill
with
merchandise
and
manufacture
such
as
come
from
all
part
of
England
,
be
consume
in
the
fire
of
London
the
next
year
after
this
terrible
visitation
.
<EOS>
It
be
incredible
what
a
trade
this
make
all
over
the
whole
kingdom
,
to
make
good
the
want
and
to
supply
that
loss
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
all
the
manufacturing
hand
in
the
nation
be
set
on
work
,
and
be
little
enough
for
several
year
to
supply
the
market
and
answer
the
demand
.
<EOS>
all
foreign
market
also
be
empty
of
our
good
by
the
stop
which
have
be
occasion
by
the
plague
,
and
before
an
open
trade
be
allow
again
;
and
the
prodigious
demand
at
home
fall
in
,
join
to
make
a
quick
vent
for
all
sort
of
good
;
so
that
there
never
be
know
such
a
trade
all
over
England
for
the
time
as
be
in
the
first
seven
year
after
the
plague
,
and
after
the
fire
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
It
remain
now
that
I
should
say
something
of
the
merciful
part
of
this
terrible
judgement
.
<EOS>
the
last
week
in
September
,
the
plague
be
come
to
its
crisis
,
its
fury
begin
to
assuage
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
friend
Dr
Heath
,
come
to
see
me
the
week
before
,
tell
me
he
be
sure
that
the
violence
of
it
would
assuage
in
a
few
day
;
but
when
I
see
the
weekly
bill
of
that
week
,
which
be
the
high
of
the
whole
year
,
be
8297
of
all
disease
,
I
upbraid
him
with
it
,
and
ask
him
what
he
have
make
his
judgement
from
.
<EOS>
His
answer
,
however
,
be
not
so
much
to
seek
as
I
think
it
would
have
be
.
<EOS>
"
look
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
by
the
number
which
be
at
this
time
sick
and
infected
,
there
should
have
be
twenty
thousand
dead
the
last
week
instead
of
eight
thousand
,
if
the
inveterate
mortal
contagion
have
be
as
it
be
two
week
ago
;
for
then
it
ordinarily
kill
in
two
or
three
day
,
now
not
under
eight
or
ten
;
and
then
not
above
one
in
five
recover
,
whereas
I
have
observe
that
now
not
above
two
in
five
miscarry
.
<EOS>
and
,
observe
it
from
me
,
the
next
bill
will
decrease
,
and
you
will
see
many
more
people
recover
than
use
to
do
;
for
though
a
vast
multitude
be
now
everywhere
infect
,
and
as
many
every
day
fall
sick
,
yet
there
will
not
so
many
die
as
there
do
,
for
the
malignity
of
the
distemper
be
abate
"
;
 
add
that
he
begin
now
to
hope
,
nay
,
more
than
hope
,
that
the
infection
have
pass
its
crisis
and
be
go
off
;
and
accordingly
so
it
be
,
for
the
next
week
<EOS>
being
,
as
I
say
,
the
last
in
September
,
the
bill
decrease
almost
two
thousand
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
the
plague
be
still
at
a
frightful
height
,
and
the
next
bill
be
no
less
than
6460
,
and
the
next
to
that
,
5720
;
but
still
my
friend
's
observation
be
just
,
and
it
do
appear
the
people
do
recover
faster
and
more
in
number
than
they
use
to
do
;
and
indeed
,
if
it
have
not
be
so
,
what
have
be
the
condition
of
the
city
of
London
?
<EOS>
for
,
accord
to
my
friend
,
there
be
not
few
than
60,000
people
at
that
time
infect
,
whereof
,
as
above
,
20,477
die
,
and
near
40,000
recover
;
whereas
,
have
it
be
as
it
be
before
,
50,000
of
that
number
would
very
probably
have
die
,
if
not
more
,
and
50,000
more
would
have
sicken
;
for
,
in
a
word
,
the
whole
mass
of
people
begin
to
sicken
,
and
it
look
as
if
none
would
escape
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
remark
of
my
friend
's
appear
more
evident
in
a
few
week
more
,
for
the
decrease
go
on
,
and
another
week
in
October
it
decrease
1843
,
so
that
the
number
dead
of
the
plague
be
but
2665
;
and
the
next
week
it
decrease
1413
more
,
and
yet
it
be
see
plainly
that
there
be
abundance
of
people
sick
,
<EOS>
nay
,
abundance
more
than
ordinary
,
and
abundance
fall
sick
every
day
but
(
as
above
)
<EOS>
the
malignity
of
the
disease
abated
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
precipitant
disposition
of
our
people
(
whether
it
be
so
or
not
all
over
the
world
,
that
be
none
of
my
particular
business
to
inquire
)
,
but
I
see
it
apparently
here
,
that
as
upon
the
first
fright
of
the
infection
they
shun
one
another
,
and
flee
from
one
another
's
house
and
from
the
city
with
an
unaccountable
and
,
as
I
think
,
unnecessary
fright
,
so
now
,
upon
this
notion
spread
,
viz
.
,
that
the
distemper
be
not
so
catch
as
formerly
,
and
that
if
it
be
catch
it
be
not
so
mortal
,
and
see
abundance
of
people
who
really
fall
sick
recover
again
daily
,
they
take
to
such
a
precipitant
courage
,
and
grow
so
entirely
regardless
of
themselves
and
of
the
infection
,
that
they
make
no
more
of
the
plague
than
of
an
ordinary
fever
,
nor
indeed
so
much
.
<EOS>
They
not
only
go
boldly
into
company
with
those
who
have
tumour
and
carbuncle
upon
them
that
be
run
,
and
consequently
contagious
,
but
ate
and
drink
with
them
,
nay
,
into
their
house
to
visit
them
,
and
even
,
as
I
be
tell
,
into
their
very
chamber
where
they
lie
sick
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
could
not
see
rational
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Dr
Heath
allow
,
and
it
be
plain
to
experience
,
that
the
distemper
be
as
catch
as
ever
,
and
as
many
fall
sick
,
but
only
he
allege
that
so
many
of
those
that
fall
sick
do
not
die
;
but
I
think
that
while
many
do
die
,
and
that
at
good
the
distemper
itself
be
very
terrible
,
the
sore
and
swelling
very
tormenting
,
and
the
danger
of
death
not
leave
out
of
the
circumstance
of
sickness
,
though
not
so
frequent
as
before
;
all
those
thing
,
together
with
the
exceed
tediousness
of
the
cure
,
the
loathsomeness
of
the
disease
,
and
many
other
article
,
be
enough
to
deter
any
man
live
from
a
dangerous
mixture
with
the
sick
people
,
and
make
them
as
anxious
almost
to
avoid
the
infection
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
there
be
another
thing
which
make
the
mere
catching
of
the
distemper
frightful
,
and
that
be
the
terrible
burning
of
the
caustic
which
the
surgeon
lay
on
the
swelling
to
bring
them
to
break
and
to
run
,
without
which
the
danger
of
death
be
very
great
,
even
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
also
,
the
insufferable
torment
of
the
swelling
,
which
,
though
it
may
not
make
people
rave
and
distract
,
as
they
be
before
,
and
as
I
have
give
several
instance
of
already
,
yet
they
put
the
patient
to
inexpressible
torment
;
and
those
that
fall
into
it
,
though
they
do
escape
with
life
,
yet
they
make
bitter
complaint
of
those
that
have
tell
them
there
be
no
danger
,
and
sadly
repent
their
rashness
and
folly
in
venture
to
run
into
the
reach
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
this
unwary
conduct
of
the
people
end
here
,
for
a
great
many
that
thus
cast
off
their
caution
<EOS>
suffer
more
deeply
still
,
and
though
many
escape
,
yet
many
die
;
and
at
least
it
have
this
public
mischief
attend
it
,
that
it
make
the
decrease
of
burial
slow
than
it
would
otherwise
have
be
.
<EOS>
for
as
this
notion
run
like
lightning
through
the
city
,
and
people
's
head
be
possess
with
it
,
even
as
soon
as
the
first
great
decrease
in
the
bill
appear
,
we
find
that
the
two
next
bill
do
not
decrease
in
proportion
;
the
reason
I
take
to
be
the
people
's
run
so
rashly
into
danger
,
give
up
all
their
former
caution
and
care
,
and
all
the
shyness
which
they
use
to
practise
,
depend
that
the
sickness
would
not
reach
them
 
or
that
if
it
do
,
they
should
not
die
.
  
<EOS>
the
physician
oppose
this
thoughtless
humour
of
the
people
with
all
their
might
,
and
give
out
print
direction
,
spread
them
all
over
the
city
and
suburb
,
advise
the
people
to
continue
reserve
,
and
to
use
still
the
utmost
caution
in
their
ordinary
conduct
,
notwithstanding
the
decrease
of
the
distemper
,
terrify
them
with
the
danger
of
bring
a
relapse
upon
the
whole
city
,
and
tell
them
how
such
a
relapse
may
be
more
fatal
and
dangerous
than
the
whole
visitation
that
have
be
already
;
with
many
argument
and
reason
to
explain
and
prove
that
part
to
them
,
and
which
be
too
long
to
repeat
here
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
to
no
purpose
;
the
audacious
creature
be
so
possessed
with
the
first
joy
and
so
surprised
with
the
satisfaction
of
see
a
vast
decrease
in
the
weekly
bill
,
that
they
be
impenetrable
by
any
new
terror
,
and
would
not
be
persuade
but
that
the
bitterness
of
death
be
past
;
and
it
be
to
no
more
purpose
to
talk
to
them
than
to
an
east
wind
;
but
they
open
shop
,
go
about
street
,
do
business
,
and
converse
with
anybody
that
come
in
their
way
to
converse
with
,
whether
with
business
or
without
,
neither
inquire
of
their
health
or
so
much
as
be
apprehensive
of
any
danger
from
them
,
though
they
know
them
not
to
be
sound
.
  
<EOS>
this
imprudent
,
rash
conduct
cost
a
great
many
their
life
who
have
with
great
care
and
caution
shut
themselves
up
and
keep
retire
,
as
it
be
,
from
all
mankind
,
and
have
by
that
mean
,
under
God
's
providence
,
be
preserve
through
all
the
heat
of
that
infection
.
  
<EOS>
this
rash
and
foolish
conduct
,
I
say
,
of
the
people
go
so
far
that
the
minister
take
notice
to
them
of
it
at
last
,
and
lay
before
them
both
the
folly
and
danger
of
it
;
and
this
check
it
a
little
,
so
that
they
grow
more
cautious
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
another
effect
,
which
they
could
not
check
;
<EOS>
for
as
the
first
rumour
have
spread
not
over
the
city
only
,
but
into
the
country
,
it
have
the
like
effect
:
and
the
people
be
so
tired
with
be
so
long
from
London
,
and
so
eager
to
come
back
,
that
they
flock
to
town
without
fear
or
forecast
,
and
begin
to
show
themselves
in
the
street
as
if
all
the
danger
be
over
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
surprising
to
see
it
,
for
though
there
die
still
from
1000
to
1800
a
week
,
yet
the
people
flock
to
town
as
if
all
have
be
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
be
,
that
the
bill
increase
again
400
the
very
first
week
in
November
;
and
if
I
may
believe
the
physician
,
there
be
above
3000
<EOS>
fall
sick
that
week
,
most
of
them
new
-
comer
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
one
John
Cock
,
a
barber
in
St
Martin's
-
le
-
Grand
,
be
an
eminent
example
of
this
;
I
mean
of
the
hasty
return
of
the
people
when
the
plague
be
abate
.
<EOS>
this
John
Cock
have
leave
the
town
with
his
whole
family
,
and
lock
up
his
house
,
and
be
go
in
the
country
,
as
many
other
do
;
and
find
the
plague
so
decrease
in
November
that
there
die
but
905
per
week
of
all
disease
,
he
venture
home
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
in
his
family
ten
person
;
that
be
to
say
,
himself
and
wife
,
five
child
,
two
apprentice
,
and
a
maid
-
servant
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
return
to
his
house
above
a
week
,
and
begin
to
open
his
shop
and
carry
on
his
trade
,
but
the
distemper
break
out
in
his
family
,
and
within
about
five
day
they
all
die
,
except
one
;
that
be
to
say
,
himself
,
his
wife
,
all
his
five
child
,
and
his
two
apprentice
;
and
only
the
maid
remain
alive
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
mercy
of
God
be
great
to
the
rest
than
we
have
reason
to
expect
;
for
the
malignity
(
as
I
have
say
)
of
the
distemper
be
spend
,
the
contagion
be
exhaust
,
and
also
the
winter
weather
come
on
apace
,
and
the
air
be
clear
and
cold
,
with
sharp
frost
;
and
this
increase
still
,
most
of
those
that
have
fall
sick
recover
,
and
the
health
of
the
city
begin
to
return
.
<EOS>
there
be
indeed
some
return
of
the
distemper
even
in
the
month
of
December
,
and
the
bill
increase
near
a
hundred
;
but
it
go
off
again
,
and
so
in
a
short
while
thing
begin
to
return
to
their
own
channel
.
<EOS>
and
wonderful
it
be
to
see
how
populous
the
city
be
again
all
on
a
sudden
,
so
that
a
stranger
could
not
miss
the
number
that
be
lose
.
<EOS>
neither
be
there
any
miss
of
the
inhabitant
as
to
their
dwelling
 
<EOS>
few
or
no
empty
house
be
to
be
see
,
or
if
there
be
some
,
there
be
no
want
of
tenant
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
that
as
the
city
have
a
new
face
,
so
the
manner
of
the
people
have
a
new
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
there
be
many
that
retain
a
sincere
sense
of
their
deliverance
,
and
be
that
heartily
thankful
to
that
Sovereign
Hand
that
have
protect
them
in
so
dangerous
a
time
;
it
would
be
very
uncharitable
to
judge
otherwise
in
a
city
so
populous
,
and
where
the
people
be
so
devout
as
they
be
here
in
the
time
of
the
visitation
itself
;
but
except
what
of
this
be
to
be
find
in
particular
family
and
face
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
the
general
practice
of
the
people
be
just
as
it
be
before
,
and
very
little
difference
be
to
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
some
,
indeed
,
say
thing
be
bad
;
that
the
moral
of
the
people
decline
from
this
very
time
;
that
the
people
,
harden
by
the
danger
they
have
be
in
,
like
seaman
after
a
storm
be
over
,
be
more
wicked
and
more
stupid
,
more
bold
and
harden
,
in
their
vice
and
immorality
than
they
be
before
;
but
I
will
not
carry
it
so
far
neither
.
<EOS>
It
would
take
up
a
history
of
no
small
length
to
give
a
particular
of
all
the
gradation
by
which
the
course
of
thing
in
this
city
come
to
be
restore
again
,
and
to
run
in
their
own
channel
as
they
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
some
part
of
England
be
now
infect
as
violently
as
London
have
be
;
the
city
of
Norwich
,
Peterborough
,
Lincoln
,
Colchester
,
and
other
place
be
now
visit
;
and
the
magistrate
of
London
begin
to
set
rule
for
our
conduct
as
to
correspond
with
those
city
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
we
could
not
pretend
to
forbid
their
people
come
to
London
,
because
it
be
impossible
to
know
them
asunder
;
so
,
after
many
consultation
,
the
Lord
Mayor
and
Court
of
Aldermen
be
oblige
to
drop
it
.
<EOS>
all
they
could
do
be
to
warn
and
caution
the
people
not
to
entertain
in
their
house
or
converse
with
any
people
who
they
know
<EOS>
come
from
such
infected
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
may
as
well
have
talk
to
the
air
,
for
the
people
of
London
think
themselves
so
plague
-
free
now
that
they
be
past
all
admonition
;
they
seem
to
depend
upon
it
that
the
air
be
restore
,
and
that
the
air
be
like
a
man
that
have
have
the
smallpox
,
not
capable
of
be
infect
again
.
<EOS>
this
revive
that
notion
that
the
infection
be
all
in
the
air
,
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
contagion
from
the
sick
people
to
the
sound
;
and
so
strongly
do
this
whimsy
prevail
among
people
that
they
run
all
together
promiscuously
,
sick
and
well
.
<EOS>
not
the
Mahometans
,
who
,
prepossess
with
the
principle
of
predestination
,
value
nothing
of
contagion
,
let
it
be
in
what
it
will
,
could
be
more
obstinate
than
the
people
of
London
;
they
that
be
perfectly
sound
,
and
come
out
of
the
wholesome
air
,
as
we
call
it
,
into
the
city
,
make
nothing
of
go
into
the
same
house
and
chamber
,
nay
,
even
into
the
same
bed
,
with
those
that
have
the
distemper
upon
them
,
and
be
not
recover
.
  
<EOS>
some
,
indeed
,
pay
for
their
audacious
boldness
with
the
price
of
their
life
;
an
infinite
number
fall
sick
,
and
the
physician
have
more
work
than
ever
,
only
with
this
difference
,
that
more
of
their
patient
recover
;
that
be
to
say
,
they
generally
recover
,
but
certainly
there
be
more
people
infect
and
fall
sick
now
,
when
there
do
not
die
above
a
thousand
or
twelve
hundred
in
a
week
,
than
there
be
when
there
die
five
or
six
thousand
<EOS>
a
week
,
<EOS>
so
entirely
negligent
be
the
people
at
that
time
in
the
great
and
dangerous
case
of
health
and
infection
,
and
so
ill
be
they
able
to
take
or
accept
of
the
advice
of
those
who
caution
them
for
their
good
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
be
thus
return
,
as
it
be
,
in
general
,
it
be
very
strange
to
find
that
in
their
inquire
after
their
friend
,
some
whole
family
be
so
entirely
sweep
away
that
there
be
no
remembrance
of
them
leave
,
neither
be
anybody
to
be
find
to
possess
or
show
any
title
to
that
little
they
have
leave
;
for
in
such
case
what
be
to
be
find
be
generally
embezzle
and
purloin
,
some
go
one
way
,
some
another
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
say
such
abandon
effect
come
to
the
king
,
as
the
universal
heir
;
upon
which
we
be
tell
,
and
I
suppose
it
be
in
part
true
,
that
the
king
grant
all
such
,
as
deodand
,
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
Court
of
Aldermen
of
London
,
to
be
apply
to
the
use
of
the
poor
,
of
whom
there
be
very
many
.
<EOS>
for
it
be
to
be
observe
,
that
though
the
occasion
of
relief
and
the
object
of
distress
be
very
many
more
in
the
time
of
the
violence
of
the
plague
than
now
after
all
be
over
,
yet
the
distress
of
the
poor
be
more
now
a
great
deal
than
it
be
then
,
because
all
the
sluice
of
general
charity
be
now
shut
.
<EOS>
People
suppose
the
main
occasion
to
be
over
,
and
so
stop
their
hand
;
whereas
particular
object
be
still
very
moving
,
and
the
distress
of
those
that
be
poor
be
very
great
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
health
of
the
city
be
now
very
much
restore
,
yet
foreign
trade
do
not
begin
to
stir
,
neither
would
foreigner
admit
our
ship
into
their
port
for
a
great
while
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
Dutch
,
the
misunderstanding
between
our
court
and
them
have
break
out
into
a
war
the
year
before
,
so
that
our
trade
that
way
be
wholly
interrupted
;
but
Spain
and
Portugal
,
Italy
and
Barbary
,
as
also
Hamburg
and
all
the
port
in
the
Baltic
,
these
be
all
shy
of
us
a
great
while
,
and
would
not
restore
trade
with
us
for
many
month
.
  
<EOS>
the
distemper
sweep
away
such
multitude
,
as
I
have
observe
,
many
if
not
all
the
out
-
parish
be
oblige
to
make
new
burying
-
ground
,
besides
that
I
have
mention
in
Bunhill
Fields
,
some
of
which
be
continue
,
and
remain
in
use
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
but
other
be
leave
off
,
and
(
which
I
confess
I
mention
with
some
reflection
)
be
convert
into
other
use
or
build
upon
afterwards
,
the
dead
body
be
disturb
,
abuse
,
dig
up
again
,
some
even
before
the
flesh
of
them
be
perish
from
the
bone
,
and
remove
like
dung
or
rubbish
to
other
place
.
<EOS>
some
of
those
which
come
within
the
reach
of
my
observation
be
as
follow
:
  
(

)
<EOS>
a
piece
of
ground
beyond
Goswell
Street
,
near
Mount
Mill
,
be
some
of
the
remain
of
the
old
line
or
fortification
of
the
city
,
where
abundance
be
bury
promiscuously
from
the
parish
of
Aldersgate
,
Clerkenwell
,
and
even
out
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
this
ground
,
as
I
take
it
,
be
since
make
a
physic
garden
,
and
after
that
have
be
build
upon
.
  
<EOS>
(

)
<EOS>
a
piece
of
ground
just
over
the
Black
Ditch
,
as
it
be
then
call
,
at
the
end
of
Holloway
Lane
,
in
Shoreditch
parish
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
since
make
a
yard
for
keep
hog
,
and
for
other
ordinary
use
,
but
be
quite
out
of
use
as
a
burying
-
ground
.
  
<EOS>
(

)
<EOS>
the
upper
end
of
Hand
Alley
,
in
Bishopsgate
Street
,
which
be
then
a
green
field
,
and
be
take
in
particularly
for
Bishopsgate
parish
,
though
many
of
the
cart
out
of
the
city
bring
their
dead
thither
also
,
particularly
out
of
the
parish
of
St
All
-
hallow
on
the
Wall
.
<EOS>
this
place
I
can
not
mention
without
much
regret
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
as
I
remember
,
about
two
or
three
year
after
the
plague
be
cease
that
Sir
Robert
Clayton
come
to
be
possess
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
be
report
,
how
true
I
know
not
,
that
it
fall
to
the
king
for
want
of
heir
,
all
those
who
have
any
right
to
it
be
carry
off
by
the
pestilence
,
and
that
Sir
Robert
Clayton
obtain
a
grant
of
it
from
King
Charles
II
.
<EOS>
but
however
he
come
by
it
,
certain
it
be
the
ground
be
let
out
to
build
on
,
or
build
upon
,
by
his
order
.
<EOS>
the
first
house
build
upon
it
be
a
large
fair
house
,
still
stand
,
which
face
the
street
or
way
now
call
Hand
Alley
which
,
though
call
an
alley
,
be
as
wide
as
a
street
.
<EOS>
the
house
in
the
same
row
with
that
house
northward
be
build
on
the
very
same
ground
where
the
poor
people
be
bury
,
and
the
body
,
on
open
the
ground
for
the
foundation
,
be
dig
up
,
some
of
them
remain
so
plain
to
be
see
that
the
woman
's
skull
be
distinguish
by
their
long
hair
,
and
of
other
the
flesh
be
not
quite
perished
;
so
that
the
people
begin
to
exclaim
loudly
against
it
,
and
some
suggest
that
it
may
endanger
a
return
of
the
contagion
;
after
which
the
bone
and
body
,
as
fast
as
they
come
at
them
,
be
carry
to
another
part
of
the
same
ground
and
throw
all
together
into
a
deep
pit
,
dig
on
purpose
,
which
now
be
to
be
know
in
that
it
be
not
build
on
,
but
be
a
passage
to
another
house
at
the
upper
end
of
Rose
Alley
,
just
against
the
door
of
a
meeting
-
house
which
have
be
build
there
many
year
since
;
and
the
ground
be
palisadoe
off
from
the
rest
of
the
passage
,
in
a
little
square
;
there
lie
the
bone
and
remain
of
near
two
thousand
body
,
carry
by
the
dead
cart
to
their
grave
in
that
one
year
.
  
<EOS>
(

besides
this
,
there
be
a
piece
of
ground
in
Moorfields
;
by
the
go
into
the
street
which
be
now
call
Old
Bethlem
,
which

stepney
parish
,
extend
itself
from
the
east
part
of
London
to
the
north
,
even
to
the
very
edge
of
Shoreditch
Churchyard
,
have
a
piece
of
ground
take
in
to
bury
their
dead
close
to
the
say
churchyard
,
and
which
for
that
very
reason
be
leave
open
,
and
be
since
,
I
suppose
,
take
into
the
same
churchyard
.
<EOS>
and
they
have
also
two
other
burying
-
place
in
Spittlefields
,
one
where
since
a
chapel
or
tabernacle
have
be
build
for
ease
to
this
great
parish
,
and
another
in
Petticoat
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
less
than
five
other
ground
make
use
of
for
the
parish
of
stepney
at
that
time
:
one
where
now
stand
the
parish
church
of
St
Paul
,
Shadwell
,
and
the
other
where
now
stand
the
parish
church
of
St
John
's
at
wapping
,
both
which
have
not
the
name
of
parish
at
that
time
,
but
be
belong
to
Stepney
parish
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
name
many
more
,
but
these
come
within
my
particular
knowledge
,
the
circumstance
,
I
think
,
make
it
of
use
to
record
them
.
<EOS>
from
the
whole
,
it
may
be
observe
that
they
be
oblige
in
this
time
of
distress
to
take
in
new
burying
-
ground
in
most
of
the
out
-
parish
for
lay
the
prodigious
number
of
people
which
die
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
;
but
why
care
be
not
take
to
keep
those
place
separate
from
ordinary
use
,
that
so
the
body
may
rest
undisturbed
,
that
I
can
not
answer
for
,
and
must
confess
I
think
it
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
who
be
to
blame
I
know
not
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
mention
that
the
Quakers
have
at
that
time
also
a
burying
-
ground
set
apart
to
their
use
,
and
which
they
still
make
use
of
;
and
they
have
also
a
particular
dead
-
cart
to
fetch
their
dead
from
their
house
;
and
the
famous
Solomon
Eagle
,
who
,
as
I
mention
before
,
have
predict
the
plague
as
a
judgement
,
and
run
naked
through
the
street
,
tell
the
people
that
it
be
come
upon
them
to
punish
them
for
their
sin
,
have
his
own
wife
die
the
very
next
day
of
the
plague
,
and
be
carry
,
one
of
the
first
in
the
Quakers
'
dead
-
cart
,
to
their
new
burying
-
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
have
throng
this
account
with
many
more
remarkable
thing
which
occur
in
the
time
of
the
infection
,
and
particularly
what
pass
between
the
Lord
Mayor
and
the
Court
,
which
be
then
at
Oxford
,
and
what
direction
be
from
time
to
time
receive
from
the
Government
for
their
conduct
on
this
critical
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
really
the
Court
concern
themselves
so
little
,
and
that
little
they
do
be
of
so
small
import
,
that
I
do
not
see
it
of
much
moment
to
mention
any
part
of
it
here
:
except
that
of
appoint
a
monthly
fast
in
the
city
and
the
send
the
royal
charity
to
the
relief
of
the
poor
,
both
which
I
have
mention
before
.
  
<EOS>
Great
be
the
reproach
throw
on
those
physician
who
leave
their
patient
during
the
sickness
,
and
now
they
come
to
town
again
nobody
care
to
employ
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
call
deserter
,
and
frequently
bill
be
set
up
upon
their
door
and
write
,
"
here
be
a
doctor
to
be
let
"
,
so
that
several
of
those
physician
be
fain
for
a
while
to
sit
still
and
look
about
them
,
or
at
least
remove
their
dwelling
,
and
set
up
in
new
place
and
among
new
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
the
like
be
the
case
with
the
clergy
,
whom
the
people
be
indeed
very
abusive
to
,
write
verse
and
scandalous
reflection
upon
them
,
set
upon
the
church
-
door
,
"
here
be
a
pulpit
to
be
let
"
,
or
sometimes
,
"
to
be
sell
"
,
which
be
bad
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
least
of
our
misfortune
that
with
our
infection
,
when
it
cease
,
there
do
not
cease
the
spirit
of
strife
and
contention
,
slander
and
reproach
,
which
be
really
the
great
troubler
of
the
nation
's
peace
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
to
be
the
remain
of
the
old
animosity
,
which
have
so
lately
involve
us
all
in
blood
and
disorder
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
late
Act
of
Indemnity
have
lay
asleep
the
quarrel
itself
,
so
the
Government
have
recommend
family
and
personal
peace
upon
all
occasion
to
the
whole
nation
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
could
not
be
obtain
;
and
particularly
after
the
ceasing
of
the
plague
in
London
,
when
any
one
that
have
see
the
condition
which
the
people
have
be
in
,
and
how
they
caress
one
another
at
that
time
,
promise
to
have
more
charity
for
the
future
,
and
to
raise
no
more
reproach
;
I
say
,
any
one
that
have
see
them
then
would
have
think
they
would
have
come
together
with
another
spirit
at
last
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
say
,
it
could
not
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
the
quarrel
remain
;
the
Church
and
the
Presbyterians
be
incompatible
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
plague
be
remove
,
the
Dissenting
oust
minister
who
have
supply
the
pulpit
which
be
desert
by
the
incumbent
retire
;
they
could
expect
no
other
but
that
they
should
immediately
fall
upon
them
and
harass
them
with
their
penal
law
,
accept
their
preaching
while
they
be
sick
,
and
persecute
them
as
soon
as
they
be
recover
again
;
this
even
we
that
be
of
the
Church
thought
be
very
hard
,
and
could
by
no
means
approve
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
Government
,
and
we
could
say
nothing
to
hinder
it
<EOS>
;
we
could
only
say
it
be
not
our
do
,
and
we
could
not
answer
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
Dissenters
reproach
those
minister
of
the
Church
with
go
away
and
desert
their
charge
,
abandon
the
people
in
their
danger
,
and
when
they
have
most
need
of
comfort
,
and
the
like
:
this
we
could
by
no
means
approve
,
for
all
man
have
not
the
same
faith
and
the
same
courage
,
and
the
scripture
command
us
to
judge
the
most
favourably
and
accord
to
charity
.
  
<EOS>
a
plague
be
a
formidable
enemy
,
and
be
armed
with
terror
that
every
man
be
not
sufficiently
fortify
to
resist
or
prepare
to
stand
the
shock
against
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
certain
that
a
great
many
of
the
clergy
who
be
in
circumstance
to
do
it
withdraw
and
flee
for
the
safety
of
their
life
;
but
'
tis
true
also
that
a
great
many
of
them
stay
,
and
many
of
them
fall
in
the
calamity
and
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
some
of
the
Dissenting
turn
-
out
minister
stay
,
and
their
courage
be
to
be
commend
and
highly
value
 
but
these
be
not
abundance
;
it
can
not
be
say
that
they
all
stay
,
and
that
none
retire
into
the
country
,
any
more
than
it
can
be
say
of
the
Church
clergy
that
they
all
go
away
.
<EOS>
neither
do
all
those
that
go
away
go
without
substituting
curate
and
other
in
their
place
,
to
do
the
office
needful
and
to
visit
the
sick
,
as
far
as
it
be
practicable
;
so
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
an
allowance
of
charity
may
have
be
make
on
both
side
,
and
we
should
have
consider
that
such
a
time
as
this
of
1665
be
not
to
be
parallel
in
history
,
and
that
it
be
not
the
stout
courage
that
will
always
support
man
in
such
case
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
say
this
,
but
have
rather
choose
to
record
the
courage
and
religious
zeal
of
those
of
both
side
,
who
do
hazard
themselves
for
the
service
of
the
poor
people
in
their
distress
,
without
remember
that
any
fail
in
their
duty
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
but
the
want
of
temper
among
us
have
make
the
contrary
to
this
necessary
:
some
that
stay
not
only
boast
too
much
of
themselves
,
but
revile
those
that
flee
,
brand
them
with
cowardice
,
desert
their
flock
,
and
act
the
part
of
the
hireling
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
I
recommend
it
to
the
charity
of
all
good
people
to
look
back
and
reflect
duly
upon
the
terror
of
the
time
,
and
whoever
do
so
well
see
that
it
be
not
an
ordinary
strength
that
could
support
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
like
appear
in
the
head
of
an
army
or
charge
a
body
of
horse
in
the
field
,
but
it
be
charge
death
itself
on
his
pale
horse
;
to
stay
be
indeed
to
die
,
and
it
could
be
esteem
nothing
less
,
especially
as
thing
appear
at
the
latter
end
of
August
and
the
beginning
of
September
,
and
as
there
be
reason
to
expect
them
at
that
time
;
for
no
man
expect
,
and
I
dare
say
believe
,
that
the
distemper
would
take
so
sudden
a
turn
as
it
do
,
and
fall
immediately
two
thousand
in
a
week
,
when
there
be
such
a
prodigious
number
of
people
sick
at
that
time
as
it
be
know
there
be
;
and
then
it
be
that
many
shift
away
that
have
stay
most
of
the
time
before
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
if
God
give
strength
to
some
more
than
to
other
,
be
it
to
boast
of
their
ability
to
abide
the
stroke
,
and
upbraid
those
that
have
not
the
same
gift
and
support
,
or
ought
not
they
rather
to
have
be
humble
and
thankful
if
they
be
render
more
useful
than
their
brother
?
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
ought
to
be
record
to
the
honour
of
such
man
,
as
well
clergy
as
physician
,
surgeon
,
apothecary
,
magistrate
,
and
officer
of
every
kind
,
as
also
all
useful
people
who
venture
their
life
in
discharge
of
their
duty
,
as
most
certainly
all
such
as
stay
do
to
the
last
degree
;
and
several
of
all
these
kind
do
not
only
venture
but
lose
their
life
on
that
sad
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
once
make
a
list
of
all
such
,
I
mean
of
all
those
profession
and
employment
who
thus
die
,
as
I
call
it
,
in
the
way
of
their
duty
;
but
it
be
impossible
for
a
private
man
to
come
at
a
certainty
in
the
particular
.
<EOS>
I
only
remember
that
there
die
sixteen
clergyman
,
two
alderman
,
five
physician
,
thirteen
surgeon
,
within
the
city
and
liberty
before
the
beginning
of
September
.
<EOS>
but
this
being
,
as
I
say
before
,
the
great
crisis
and
extremity
of
the
infection
,
it
can
be
no
complete
list
.
<EOS>
as
to
inferior
people
,
I
think
there
die
six
-
and
-
forty
constable
and
head
-
borough
in
the
two
parish
of
Stepney
and
Whitechappel
;
but
I
could
not
carry
my
list
oil
,
for
when
the
violent
rage
of
the
distemper
in
September
come
upon
us
,
it
drive
us
out
of
all
measure
.
<EOS>
man
do
then
no
more
die
by
tale
and
by
number
.
<EOS>
They
may
put
out
a
weekly
bill
,
and
call
them
seven
or
eight
thousand
,
or
what
they
please
;
'
tis
certain
they
die
by
heap
,
and
be
bury
by
heap
,
that
be
to
say
,
without
account
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
may
believe
some
people
,
who
be
more
abroad
and
more
conversant
with
those
thing
than
I
though
I
be
public
enough
for
one
that
have
no
more
business
to
do
than
I
have
,
 
I
say
,
if
I
may
believe
them
,
there
be
not
many
less
bury
those
first
three
week
in
September
than
20,000
per
week
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
other
aver
the
truth
of
it
;
yet
I
rather
choose
to
keep
to
the
public
account
;
seven
and
eight
thousand
per
week
be
enough
to
make
good
all
that
I
have
say
of
the
terror
of
those
time
;
 
and
it
be
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
me
that
write
,
as
well
as
those
that
read
,
to
be
able
to
say
that
everything
be
set
down
with
moderation
,
and
rather
within
compass
than
beyond
it
.
  
<EOS>
upon
all
these
account
,
I
say
,
I
could
wish
,
when
we
be
recover
,
our
conduct
have
be
more
distinguished
for
charity
and
kindness
in
remembrance
of
the
past
calamity
,
and
not
so
much
a
valuing
ourselves
upon
our
boldness
in
stay
,
as
if
all
man
be
coward
that
fly
from
the
hand
of
God
,
or
that
those
who
stay
do
not
sometimes
owe
their
courage
to
their
ignorance
,
and
despise
the
hand
of
their
maker
 
which
be
a
criminal
kind
of
desperation
,
and
not
a
true
courage
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
leave
it
upon
record
that
the
civil
officer
,
such
as
constable
,
head
-
borough
,
Lord
Mayor
's
and
sheriffs'-men
,
as
also
parish
officer
,
whose
business
it
be
to
take
charge
of
the
poor
,
do
their
duty
in
general
with
as
much
courage
as
any
,
and
perhaps
with
more
,
because
their
work
be
attend
with
more
hazard
,
and
lie
more
among
the
poor
,
who
be
more
subject
to
be
infect
,
and
in
the
most
pitiful
plight
when
they
be
take
with
the
infection
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
must
be
add
,
too
,
that
a
great
number
of
them
die
;
indeed
it
be
scarce
possible
it
should
be
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
say
one
word
here
about
the
physic
or
preparation
that
we
ordinarily
make
use
of
on
this
terrible
occasion
 
<EOS>
I
mean
we
that
go
frequently
abroad
and
up
down
street
,
as
I
do
;
much
of
this
be
talk
of
in
the
book
and
bill
of
our
quack
doctor
,
of
whom
I
have
say
enough
already
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
however
,
be
add
,
that
the
College
of
Physicians
be
daily
publish
several
preparation
,
which
they
have
consider
of
in
the
process
of
their
practice
,
and
which
,
be
to
be
have
in
print
,
I
avoid
repeat
them
for
that
reason
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
I
could
not
help
observe
:
what
befall
one
of
the
quack
,
who
publish
that
he
have
a
most
excellent
preservative
against
the
plague
,
which
whoever
keep
about
them
should
never
be
infect
or
liable
to
infection
.
<EOS>
this
man
,
who
,
we
may
reasonably
suppose
,
do
not
go
abroad
without
some
of
this
excellent
preservative
in
his
pocket
,
yet
be
take
by
the
distemper
,
and
carry
off
in
two
or
three
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
of
the
number
of
the
physic
-
hater
or
physic
-
despiser
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
often
mention
the
regard
I
have
to
the
dictate
of
my
particular
friend
Dr
Heath
;
but
yet
I
must
acknowledge
I
make
use
of
little
or
nothing
 
except
,
as
I
have
observe
,
to
keep
a
preparation
of
strong
scent
to
have
ready
,
in
case
I
meet
with
anything
of
offensive
smell
or
go
too
near
any
burying
-
place
or
dead
body
.
  
<EOS>
neither
do
I
do
what
I
know
some
do
:
keep
the
spirit
always
high
and
hot
with
cordial
and
wine
and
such
thing
;
and
which
,
as
I
observe
,
one
learn
physician
use
himself
so
much
to
as
that
he
could
not
leave
them
off
when
the
infection
be
quite
go
,
and
so
become
a
sot
for
all
his
life
after
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
my
friend
the
doctor
use
to
say
that
there
be
a
certain
set
of
drug
and
preparation
which
be
all
certainly
good
and
useful
in
the
case
of
an
infection
;
out
of
which
,
or
with
which
,
physician
may
make
an
infinite
variety
of
medicine
,
as
the
ringer
of
bell
make
several
hundred
different
round
of
music
by
the
change
and
order
or
sound
but
in
six
bell
,
and
that
all
these
preparation
shall
be
really
very
good
:
"
therefore
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
wonder
that
so
vast
a
throng
of
medicine
be
offer
in
the
present
calamity
,
and
almost
every
physician
prescribe
or
prepare
a
different
thing
,
as
his
judgement
or
experience
guide
him
;
but
"
,
say
my
friend
,
"
let
all
the
prescription
of
all
the
physician
in
London
be
examine
,
and
it
will
be
find
that
they
be
all
compound
of
the
same
thing
,
with
such
variation
only
as
the
particular
fancy
of
the
doctor
lead
him
to
;
so
that
"
,
say
he
,
"
every
man
,
judge
a
little
of
his
own
constitution
and
manner
of
his
living
,
and
circumstance
of
his
be
infect
,
may
direct
his
own
medicine
out
of
the
ordinary
drug
and
preparation
.
<EOS>
only
that
"
,
say
he
,
"
some
recommend
one
thing
as
most
sovereign
,
and
some
another
.
<EOS>
some
"
,
say
he
,
"
think
that
pill
.
<EOS>
ruff
.
,
which
be
call
itself
the
anti
-
pestilential
pill
be
the
good
preparation
that
can
be
make
;
other
think
that
Venice
treacle
be
sufficient
of
itself
to
resist
the
contagion
;
and
I
"
,
say
he
,
"
think
as
both
these
think
,
viz
.
,
that
the
last
be
good
to
take
beforehand
to
prevent
it
,
and
the
first
,
if
touch
,
to
expel
it
.
"
<EOS>
accord
to
this
opinion
,
I
several
time
take
Venice
treacle
,
and
a
sound
sweat
upon
it
,
and
think
myself
as
well
fortify
against
the
infection
as
any
one
could
be
fortify
by
the
power
of
physic
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
quackery
and
mountebank
,
of
which
the
town
be
so
full
,
I
listen
to
none
of
them
,
and
have
observe
often
since
,
with
some
wonder
,
<EOS>
that
for
two
year
after
the
plague
I
scarcely
see
or
hear
of
one
of
them
about
town
.
<EOS>
some
fancy
they
be
all
sweep
away
in
the
infection
to
a
man
,
and
be
for
call
it
a
particular
mark
of
God
's
vengeance
upon
them
for
lead
the
poor
people
into
the
pit
of
destruction
,
merely
for
the
lucre
of
a
little
money
they
get
by
them
;
but
I
can
not
go
that
length
neither
.
<EOS>
that
abundance
of
them
die
be
certain
 
many
of
them
come
within
the
reach
of
my
own
knowledge
 
but
that
all
of
them
be
sweep
off
I
much
question
.
<EOS>
I
believe
rather
they
flee
into
the
country
and
try
their
practice
upon
the
people
there
,
who
be
in
apprehension
of
the
infection
before
it
come
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
certain
,
not
a
man
of
them
appear
for
a
great
while
in
or
about
London
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
several
doctor
who
publish
bill
recommend
their
several
physical
preparation
for
cleanse
the
body
,
as
they
call
it
,
after
the
plague
,
and
needful
,
as
they
say
,
for
such
people
to
take
who
have
be
visit
and
have
be
cure
;
whereas
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
believe
that
it
be
the
opinion
of
the
most
eminent
physician
at
that
time
that
the
plague
be
itself
a
sufficient
purge
,
and
that
those
who
escape
the
infection
need
no
physic
to
cleanse
their
body
of
any
other
thing
;
the
run
sore
,
the
tumour
,
&
c.
,
which
be
break
and
keep
open
by
the
direction
of
the
physician
,
have
sufficiently
cleanse
them
;
and
that
all
other
distemper
,
and
cause
of
distemper
,
be
effectually
carry
off
that
way
;
and
as
the
physician
give
this
as
their
opinion
wherever
they
come
,
the
quack
get
little
business
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
several
little
hurry
which
happen
after
the
decrease
of
the
plague
,
and
which
,
whether
they
be
contrive
to
fright
and
disorder
the
people
,
as
some
imagine
,
I
can
not
say
,
but
sometimes
we
be
tell
the
plague
would
return
by
such
a
time
;
and
the
famous
Solomon
Eagle
,
the
naked
Quaker
I
have
mention
,
prophesy
evil
tiding
every
day
;
and
several
other
tell
us
that
London
have
not
be
sufficiently
scourge
,
and
that
sorer
and
severer
stroke
be
yet
behind
.
<EOS>
have
they
stop
there
,
or
have
they
descend
to
particular
,
and
tell
us
that
the
city
should
the
next
year
be
destroy
by
fire
,
then
,
indeed
,
when
we
have
see
it
come
to
pass
,
we
should
not
have
be
to
blame
to
have
pay
more
than
a
common
respect
to
their
prophetic
spirit
;
at
least
we
should
have
wonder
at
them
,
and
have
be
more
serious
in
our
inquiry
after
the
meaning
of
it
,
and
whence
they
have
the
foreknowledge
.
<EOS>
but
as
they
generally
tell
us
of
a
relapse
into
the
plague
,
we
have
have
no
concern
since
that
about
them
;
yet
by
those
frequent
clamour
,
we
be
all
keep
with
some
kind
of
apprehension
constantly
upon
us
;
and
if
any
die
suddenly
,
or
if
the
spot
fever
at
any
time
increase
,
we
be
presently
alarm
;
much
more
if
the
number
of
the
plague
increase
,
for
to
the
end
of
the
year
there
be
always
between
200
and
300
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
on
any
of
these
occasion
,
I
say
,
we
be
alarm
anew
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
remember
the
city
of
London
before
the
fire
must
remember
that
there
be
then
no
such
place
as
we
now
call
Newgate
Market
,
but
that
in
the
middle
of
the
street
which
be
now
call
Blowbladder
Street
,
and
which
have
its
name
from
the
butcher
,
who
use
to
kill
and
dress
their
sheep
there
(
and
who
,
it
seem
,
have
a
custom
to
blow
up
their
meat
with
pipe
to
make
it
look
thick
and
fat
than
it
be
,
and
be
punish
there
for
it
by
the
Lord
Mayor
)
;
I
say
,
from
the
end
of
the
street
towards
Newgate
there
stand
two
long
row
of
shamble
for
the
selling
meat
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
those
shamble
that
two
person
fall
down
dead
,
as
they
be
buy
meat
,
give
rise
to
a
rumour
that
the
meat
be
all
infect
;
which
,
though
it
may
affright
the
people
,
and
spoil
the
market
for
two
or
three
day
,
yet
it
appear
plainly
afterwards
that
there
be
nothing
of
truth
in
the
suggestion
.
<EOS>
but
nobody
can
account
for
the
possession
of
fear
when
it
take
hold
of
the
mind
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
please
God
,
by
the
continuing
of
the
winter
weather
,
so
to
restore
the
health
of
the
city
that
by
February
follow
we
reckon
the
distemper
quite
cease
,
and
then
we
be
not
so
easily
fright
again
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
still
a
question
among
the
learn
,
and
at
first
perplex
the
people
a
little
:
and
that
be
in
what
manner
to
purge
the
house
and
good
where
the
plague
have
be
,
and
how
to
render
them
habitable
again
,
which
have
be
leave
empty
during
the
time
of
the
plague
.
<EOS>
abundance
of
perfume
and
preparation
be
prescribe
by
physician
,
some
of
one
kind
and
some
of
another
,
in
which
the
people
who
listen
to
them
put
themselves
to
a
great
,
and
indeed
,
in
my
opinion
,
to
an
unnecessary
expense
;
and
the
poor
people
,
who
only
set
open
their
window
night
and
day
,
burn
brimstone
,
pitch
,
and
gunpowder
,
and
such
thing
in
their
room
,
do
as
well
as
the
good
;
nay
,
the
eager
people
who
,
as
I
say
above
,
come
home
in
haste
and
at
all
hazard
,
find
little
or
no
inconvenience
in
their
house
,
nor
in
the
good
,
and
do
little
or
nothing
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
in
general
,
prudent
,
cautious
people
do
enter
into
some
measure
for
air
and
sweeten
their
house
,
and
burn
perfume
,
incense
,
benjamin
,
rozin
,
and
sulphur
in
their
room
close
shut
up
,
and
then
let
the
air
carry
it
all
out
with
a
blast
of
gunpowder
;
other
cause
large
fire
to
be
make
all
day
and
all
night
for
several
day
and
night
;
by
the
same
token
that
two
or
three
be
pleased
to
set
their
house
on
fire
,
and
so
effectually
sweeten
them
by
burn
them
down
to
the
ground
;
as
particularly
one
at
Ratcliff
,
one
in
Holbourn
,
and
one
at
Westminster
;
besides
two
or
three
that
be
set
on
fire
,
but
the
fire
be
happily
get
out
again
before
it
go
far
enough
to
burn
down
the
house
;
and
one
citizen
's
servant
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
be
in
Thames
Street
,
carry
so
much
gunpowd
into
his
master
's
house
,
for
clear
it
of
the
infection
,
and
manage
it
so
foolishly
,
that
he
blow
up
part
of
the
roof
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
but
the
time
be
not
fully
come
that
the
city
be
to
be
purge
by
fire
,
nor
be
it
far
off
;
for
within
nine
month
more
I
see
it
all
lie
in
ashe
;
when
,
as
some
of
our
quack
philosopher
pretend
,
the
seed
of
the
plague
be
entirely
destroy
,
and
not
before
;
a
notion
too
ridiculous
to
speak
of
here
:
since
,
have
the
seed
of
the
plague
remain
in
the
house
,
not
to
be
destroy
but
by
fire
,
how
have
it
be
that
they
have
not
since
break
out
,
see
all
those
building
in
the
suburb
and
liberty
,
all
in
the
great
parish
of
Stepney
,
Whitechappel
,
Aldgate
,
Bishopsgate
,
Shoreditch
,
Cripplegate
,
and
St
Giles
,
where
the
fire
never
come
,
and
where
the
plague
rage
with
the
great
violence
,
remain
still
in
the
same
condition
they
be
in
before
?
  
<EOS>
but
to
leave
these
thing
just
as
I
find
them
,
it
be
certain
that
those
people
who
be
more
than
ordinarily
cautious
of
their
health
,
do
take
particular
direction
for
what
they
call
seasoning
of
their
house
,
and
abundance
of
costly
thing
be
consume
on
that
account
which
I
can
not
but
say
not
only
season
those
house
,
as
they
desire
,
but
fill
the
air
with
very
grateful
and
wholesome
smell
which
other
have
the
share
of
the
benefit
of
as
well
as
those
who
be
at
the
expense
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
after
all
,
though
the
poor
come
to
town
very
precipitantly
,
as
I
have
say
,
yet
I
must
say
the
rich
make
no
such
haste
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
business
,
indeed
,
come
up
,
but
many
of
them
do
not
bring
their
family
to
town
till
the
spring
come
on
,
and
that
they
see
reason
to
depend
upon
it
that
the
plague
would
not
return
.
  
<EOS>
the
Court
,
indeed
,
come
up
soon
after
Christmas
,
but
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
except
such
as
depend
upon
and
have
employment
under
the
administration
,
do
not
come
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
take
notice
here
that
,
notwithstanding
the
violence
of
the
plague
in
London
and
in
other
place
,
yet
it
be
very
observable
that
it
be
never
on
board
the
fleet
;
and
yet
for
some
time
there
be
a
strange
press
in
the
river
,
and
even
in
the
street
,
for
seaman
to
man
the
fleet
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
,
when
the
plague
be
scarce
begin
,
and
not
at
all
come
down
to
that
part
of
the
city
where
they
usually
press
for
seaman
;
and
though
a
war
with
the
Dutch
be
not
at
all
grateful
to
the
people
at
that
time
,
and
the
seaman
go
with
a
kind
of
reluctancy
into
the
service
,
and
many
complain
of
be
drag
into
it
by
force
,
yet
it
prove
in
the
event
a
happy
violence
to
several
of
them
,
who
have
probably
perish
in
the
general
calamity
,
and
who
,
after
the
summer
service
be
over
,
though
they
have
cause
to
lament
the
desolation
of
their
family
 
<EOS>
who
,
when
they
come
back
,
be
many
of
them
in
their
grave
 
yet
they
have
room
to
be
thankful
that
they
be
carry
out
of
the
reach
of
it
,
though
so
much
against
their
will
.
<EOS>
We
indeed
have
a
hot
war
with
the
Dutch
that
year
,
and
one
very
great
engagement
at
sea
in
which
the
Dutch
be
worst
,
but
we
lose
a
great
many
man
and
some
ship
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
observe
,
the
plague
be
not
in
the
fleet
,
and
when
they
come
to
lay
up
the
ship
in
the
river
the
violent
part
of
it
begin
to
abate
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
be
glad
if
I
could
close
the
account
of
this
melancholy
year
with
some
particular
example
historically
;
I
mean
of
the
thankfulness
to
God
,
our
preserver
,
for
our
be
deliver
from
this
dreadful
calamity
.
<EOS>
certainly
the
circumstance
of
the
deliverance
,
as
well
as
the
terrible
enemy
we
be
deliver
from
,
call
upon
the
whole
nation
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
the
deliverance
be
indeed
very
remarkable
,
as
I
have
in
part
mention
already
,
and
particularly
the
dreadful
condition
which
we
be
all
in
when
we
be
to
the
surprise
of
the
whole
town
make
joyful
with
the
hope
of
a
stop
of
the
infection
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
immediate
finger
of
God
,
nothing
but
omnipotent
power
,
could
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
the
contagion
despise
all
medicine
;
death
rage
in
every
corner
;
and
have
it
go
on
as
it
do
then
,
a
few
week
more
would
have
clear
the
town
of
all
,
and
everything
that
have
a
soul
.
<EOS>
man
everywhere
begin
to
despair
;
every
heart
fail
them
for
fear
;
people
be
make
desperate
through
the
anguish
of
their
soul
,
and
the
terror
of
death
sit
in
the
very
face
and
countenance
of
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
in
that
very
moment
when
we
may
very
well
say
,
"
Vain
be
the
help
of
man
'
,
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
in
that
very
moment
it
please
God
,
with
a
most
agreeable
surprise
,
to
cause
the
fury
of
it
to
abate
,
even
of
itself
;
and
the
malignity
decline
,
as
I
have
say
,
though
infinite
number
be
sick
,
yet
fewer
die
,
and
the
very
first
week
'
bill
decrease
1843
;
<EOS>
a
vast
number
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
change
that
appear
in
the
very
countenance
of
the
people
that
Thursday
morning
when
the
weekly
bill
come
out
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
perceive
in
their
countenance
that
a
secret
surprise
and
smile
of
joy
sit
on
everybody
's
face
.
<EOS>
They
shake
one
another
by
the
hand
in
the
street
,
who
would
hardly
go
on
the
same
side
of
the
way
with
one
another
before
.
<EOS>
where
the
street
be
not
too
broad
they
would
open
their
window
and
call
from
one
house
to
another
,
and
ask
how
they
do
,
and
if
they
have
hear
the
good
news
that
the
plague
be
abate
.
<EOS>
some
would
return
,
when
they
say
good
news
,
and
ask
,
"
what
good
news
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
they
answer
that
the
plague
be
abate
and
the
bill
decrease
almost
two
thousand
,
they
would
cry
out
,
"
God
be
praise
I
"
and
would
weep
aloud
for
joy
,
tell
them
they
have
hear
nothing
of
it
;
and
such
be
the
joy
of
the
people
that
it
be
,
as
it
be
,
life
to
them
from
the
grave
.
<EOS>
I
could
almost
set
down
as
many
extravagant
thing
do
in
the
excess
of
their
joy
as
of
their
grief
;
but
that
would
be
to
lessen
the
value
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
confess
myself
to
have
be
very
much
dejected
just
before
this
happen
;
for
the
prodigious
number
that
be
take
sick
the
week
or
two
before
,
besides
those
that
die
,
be
such
,
and
the
lamentation
be
so
great
everywhere
,
that
a
man
must
have
seem
to
have
act
even
against
his
reason
if
he
have
so
much
as
expect
to
escape
;
and
as
there
be
hardly
a
house
but
mine
in
all
my
neighbourhood
but
be
infect
,
so
have
it
go
on
it
would
not
have
be
long
that
there
would
have
be
any
more
neighbour
to
be
infect
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
hardly
credible
what
dreadful
havoc
the
last
three
week
have
make
,
for
if
I
may
believe
the
person
whose
calculation
I
always
find
very
well
ground
,
there
be
not
less
than
30,000
people
dead
and
near
100.000
fallen
sick
in
the
three
week
I
speak
of
;
for
the
number
that
sicken
be
surprising
,
indeed
it
be
astonishing
,
and
those
whose
courage
uphold
them
all
the
time
before
,
sink
under
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
their
distress
,
when
the
condition
of
the
city
of
London
be
so
truly
calamitous
,
just
then
it
please
God
 
as
it
be
by
His
immediate
hand
to
disarm
this
enemy
;
the
poison
be
take
out
of
the
sting
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
;
even
the
physician
themselves
be
surprised
at
it
.
<EOS>
wherever
they
visit
they
find
their
patient
better
;
either
they
have
sweat
kindly
,
or
the
tumour
be
broke
,
or
the
carbuncle
go
down
and
<EOS>
the
inflammation
round
them
change
colour
,
or
the
fever
be
go
,
or
the
violent
headache
be
assuage
,
or
some
good
symptom
be
in
the
case
;
so
that
in
a
few
day
everybody
be
recover
,
whole
family
that
be
infect
and
down
,
that
have
minister
pray
with
them
,
and
expect
death
every
hour
,
be
revive
and
heal
,
and
none
die
at
all
out
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
this
by
any
new
medicine
find
out
,
or
new
method
of
cure
discover
,
or
by
any
experience
in
the
operation
which
the
physician
or
surgeon
attain
to
;
but
it
be
evidently
from
the
secret
invisible
hand
of
Him
that
have
at
first
send
this
disease
as
a
judgement
upon
us
;
and
let
the
atheistic
part
of
mankind
call
my
saying
what
they
please
,
it
be
no
enthusiasm
;
it
be
acknowledge
at
that
time
by
all
mankind
.
<EOS>
the
disease
be
enervate
and
its
malignity
spend
;
and
let
it
proceed
from
whencesoever
it
will
,
let
the
philosopher
search
for
reason
in
nature
to
account
for
it
by
,
and
labour
as
much
as
they
will
to
lessen
the
debt
they
owe
to
their
Maker
,
those
physician
who
have
the
least
share
of
religion
in
them
be
oblige
to
acknowledge
that
it
be
all
supernatural
,
that
it
be
extraordinary
,
and
that
no
account
could
be
give
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
should
say
that
this
be
a
visible
summon
to
us
all
to
thankfulness
,
especially
we
that
be
under
the
terror
of
its
increase
,
perhaps
it
may
be
think
by
some
,
after
the
sense
of
the
thing
be
over
,
an
officious
canting
of
religious
thing
,
preach
a
sermon
instead
of
write
a
history
,
make
myself
a
teacher
instead
of
give
my
observation
of
thing
;
and
this
restrain
me
very
much
from
go
on
here
as
I
may
otherwise
do
.
<EOS>
but
if
ten
leper
be
heal
,
and
but
one
return
to
give
thank
,
I
desire
to
be
as
that
one
,
and
to
be
thankful
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
nor
will
I
deny
but
there
be
abundance
of
people
who
,
to
all
appearance
,
be
very
thankful
at
that
time
;
for
their
mouth
be
stop
,
even
the
mouth
of
those
whose
heart
be
not
extraordinary
long
affect
with
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
impression
be
so
strong
at
that
time
that
it
could
not
be
resist
;
no
,
not
by
the
bad
of
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
common
thing
to
meet
people
in
the
street
that
be
stranger
,
and
that
we
know
nothing
at
all
of
,
express
their
surprise
.
<EOS>
go
one
day
through
Aldgate
,
and
a
pretty
many
people
be
pass
and
repasse
,
there
come
a
man
out
of
the
end
of
the
Minories
,
and
look
a
little
up
the
street
and
down
,
he
throw
his
hand
abroad
,
"
Lord
,
what
an
alteration
be
here
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
why
,
last
week
I
come
along
here
,
and
hardly
anybody
be
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
another
man
 
<EOS>
I
hear
him
 
add
to
his
word
,
"
'
<EOS>
Tis
all
wonderful
;
'
tis
all
a
dream
.
"
<EOS>
"
bless
be
God
,
"
say
a
third
man
,
and
and
let
us
give
thank
to
Him
,
for
'
tis
all
<EOS>
His
own
doing
,
human
help
and
human
skill
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
all
stranger
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
but
such
salutation
as
these
be
frequent
in
the
street
every
day
;
and
in
spite
of
a
loose
behaviour
,
the
very
common
people
go
along
the
street
give
God
thank
for
their
deliverance
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
,
as
I
say
before
,
the
people
have
cast
off
all
apprehension
,
and
that
too
fast
;
indeed
we
be
no
more
afraid
now
to
pass
by
a
man
with
a
white
cap
upon
his
head
,
or
with
a
doth
wrapt
round
his
neck
,
or
with
his
leg
limping
,
occasion
by
the
sore
in
his
groin
,
all
which
be
frightful
to
the
last
degree
,
but
the
week
before
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
street
be
full
of
them
,
and
these
poor
recover
creature
,
give
them
their
due
,
appear
very
sensible
of
their
unexpected
deliverance
;
and
I
should
wrong
them
very
much
if
I
should
not
acknowledge
that
I
believe
many
of
them
be
really
thankful
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
own
that
,
for
the
generality
of
the
people
,
it
may
too
justly
be
say
of
them
as
be
say
of
the
child
of
Israel
after
their
be
deliver
from
the
host
of
Pharaoh
,
when
they
pass
the
Red
Sea
,
and
look
back
and
see
the
Egyptians
overwhelm
in
the
water
:
viz
.
,
that
they
sing
His
praise
,
but
they
soon
forget
His
work
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
go
no
farther
here
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
count
censorious
,
and
perhaps
unjust
,
if
I
should
enter
into
the
unplease
work
of
reflecting
,
whatever
cause
there
be
for
it
,
upon
the
unthankfulness
and
return
of
all
manner
of
wickedness
among
us
,
which
I
be
so
much
an
eye
-
witness
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
shall
conclude
the
account
of
this
calamitous
year
therefore
with
a
coarse
but
sincere
stanza
of
my
own
,
which
I
place
at
the
end
of
my
ordinary
memorandum
the
same
year
they
be
write
:
     
<EOS>
a
dreadful
plague
in
London
be
in
the
year
sixty
-
five
,
which
sweep
an
hundred
thousand
soul
away
;
yet
I
alive
!
